what
do
you

the

any?
justice

in

words,
you
think
there's
no

you
at
all?
justice

black
where
is
this
land?
justice

but
is
it
in

louisiana?
justice

which
one
do
you
claim
it
stands?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
why
do
you
claim
it's
there?
justice

black
because
the

is

is
it

justice

have
they

tax
to

on

--
justice

black
--
during

the
history
of

justice
hugo
l.
black
they
claim
that
--
there's
been
a
shift
due
to
the
man-made
avulsions,
is
it
not?
justice

black
what
do
you
say
about
that?
justice

black
do
you
say
there
has
been
a

not?
justice

caused
by
what,
do
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
with
them
it
is
caused
by
an
avulsion,
man-made
avulsion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
did
change
the
mississippi
river
itself,
do
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
didn't
you
say
it
shifted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
does
it
happen
that
mississippi
is
claiming
land
now
but
didn't
claim
before
1954?
justice

black
alright,
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
channel
of
navigation
is
now
to
the
west?
justice
hugo
l.
black
caused
by
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
claim
that
the
--
the
channel
changing
has
given
the
land
to
the
zucarros
because
it's
non-mississippi?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
claim
that
it
didn't
--
never
has
been
in
mississippi.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it's
not
yet
and
that
there
has
been
no
shift
to
the
river
that
gives
it
to
mississippi.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
that
the
shifted
thalweg
remains
the
boundary?
justice

black
wherever
it
go?
justice
hugo

black
year
to
year?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
if
it's
done
by
a
man?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
what
else
would
make
in
the
principle
as
to
whether
it's
above
or
below
if
the
river
came
to
the
question
of
whether
it's
changed
by
a
man
or
artificially.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
wouldn't
it
still
depend
on
who
--
where
the
river
is,
where
the
land
was
in
mississippi
or
louisiana,
wouldn't
that
be
the
crucial
issue
to
go
up?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
difference
of
that
in
illinois
well
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that
half
of
mississippi
--
suppose
it
would
half
mississippi
instead
of
just
being
this
much,
i
mean
half
of
louisiana.
you
would
have
a
title
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
you
say
it
shifts
along
with
the
thalweg.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
court
permits
the
file,
are
you
objecting
the
saying
if
the
(inaudible)
influence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
lawsuit
depend
on
where
the
--
other
the
lands
in
mississippi
or
louisiana?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
it
depends
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
crucial
issue
being
whether
it's
in
louisiana
or
mississippi.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
--
why
is
mississippi
defending?
justice
hugo
l.
black
depending
on
the
ground
that
it's
in
mississippi?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
accretion
of
--
on
the
soil
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
said
that
the
man
owning
the
property
next
to
it
was
like
an
owner
of
flocks
and
herbs,
that
they're
entitled
to
the
natural
inquiry.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
they
claim
is
not
natural
inquiry.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
claim
that
this
is
due
to
man-made
work.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
the
--
of
course,
he
concludes
something
when
they
alleged
it,
aren't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
they're
alleging
is
that
this
is
a
man-made
work
in
this
file
question.
you
might
say
that
we
would
make
them
tell
on
how
--
what
men
did
and
going
to
details
about
when
he
did
it
and
who
did
it
and
how
much
he
paid
for
it
but
after
all,
what
they
alleged
is
it's
a
man-made
job,
don't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
--
because
i
--
i've
just
read
the
--
this
case
of
yours
that
you
referred
to.
you
referred
to
the
live
thalweg,
alright,
you'd
mean
the
new
one
after
the
stream
shifted.
that's
what
you'd
mean
by
the
live
one
is
it
or
the
deadman?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
what
case
--
what
case
of
this
court
has
held,
that's
the
one
i
was
concern
in
here,
could
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
tell
me?
has
held
that
where
the
thalweg
has
changed
by
reason
of
man
avulsion
or
man's
work,
artificial
work
that
the
boundary
of
the
states
also
says
with
that
--
to
go
along
with
the
new
thalweg?
what
case
of
this
court
tells
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
this.
the
cases
have
held
unless
changed
by
reason
of
the
natural
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tide,
the
natural
change
within
the
stream,
man
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
that
the
thalweg,
being
where
the
thalweg
--
the
boundary,
continues
to
be
the
boundary
where
the
shifting
changes
of
the
stream,
can
you
tell?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
case
has
held
is
--
does
the
new
thalweg
that
becomes
the
boundary,
if
the
new
thalweg
is
caused
by
shifting
of
the
stream
with
man
produced?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
they
alleged
that
in
your
brief
and
that's
a
man's
work
and
yet
you
say
that
the
--
that
the
boundary
shifts
with
the
shifting
of
the
thalweg
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
just
read
your
opinion
that
county
of
st.
clair
and
i
just
don't
see
where
it
says
that
at
all.
now,
is
there
any
other
case
that
proceed
to
it
in
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
say
this
is
not
accretive
within
the
technical
artistic
meaning
of
that
word.
they
say
its
change
brought
about
by
a
man-made
avulsion.(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i'm
asking
if
you
had
any
case
besides
to
the
st.
clair
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
that's
correct,
when
is
the
live
thalweg
is
brought
about
by
consensuses
of
nature
in
shifting
the
stream.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we're
asking
the
court
to
take
judicial
notice
--
notice
of
this
map
and
note
that
the
--
the
glasscock
cutoff
areas
here
and
we
can
see
the
changes
in
state
boundary
was
made
but
the
thalweg
continued
to
be
the
boundary
here
and
that
is
what
they're
asking
the
court
to
change
a
--
to
setup
a
new
rule
of
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
you
read
your
complaint
as
charging
that
the
change
or
the
shift
is
viewed
to
accretion
coming
onto
the
side
of
the
river,
which
accretions
were
caused
by
man-made
work
at
the
bar?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
--
the
difference
in
legal
course
you
and
your
adversary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
asked
us
to
either
expand
or
(inaudible)
with
case
or
simply
hold
that
the
language
there
were
would
apply
to
accretions
caused
by
man-made
avulsions
and
you
say
that
--
that
language
in
that
opinion
should
not
be
so
construed
unless
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
could
so
find.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
that
ever
been
held
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
how
much
the
land
there
is
in
that
u
shape?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
government
has
to
prove
the
(inaudible)
instead
of
having
19
by
4
(inaudible)?
what
would
have
been
the
rule
then,
is
that
a
change
for
having
avulsion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
the
government
decides
to
(inaudible)
you
changed
the
--
that's
what
the
--
that
is
the
19
by
4
(inaudible)
50
miles
on
side
of
the
stream
where
it
hasn't
been

what
would
that
be?
and
would
that
change
the
state
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
amount
of
the
river
(inaudible)?
what
is
the
exact
amount
of
land
involved
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo

black
yes.
justice
hugo

black
is
there
any
difference
in
the
accretion
with
the
rule
(inaudible)?
justice

black
may
i
ask
you
whether
the
fact
(inaudible)
other
than
mississippi
and
louisiana?
justice

black
what
are
the
factors
(inaudible)
the
oil
having
been
the
concern?
justice

so
that
in

lousiana?
justice

do
you

it's
