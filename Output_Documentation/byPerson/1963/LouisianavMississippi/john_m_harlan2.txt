could
you
intervene
in
the
private
litigation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
going
to
deal
though
with
the
question
of
--
assuming
that
jurisdiction
is
accepted
with
--
as
to
whether
the
private
litigations
should
be
stayed?
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
i'm
sorry,
i'll
let
you
finish
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
did
you
say
you
filed
a
separate
amended
brief
with
the
map?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you
are
really
saying
i
think
it
was
that
the
motion
for
this
file
has
granted
you
would
be
in
here
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
that
isn't
quite
the
issue
you've
gotten
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
for
us.
