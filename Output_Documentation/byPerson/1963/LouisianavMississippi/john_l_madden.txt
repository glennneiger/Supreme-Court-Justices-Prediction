mr.
john
l.
madden
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
set
down
for
our
argument
at
this
time
is
a
motion
of
the
state
of
louisiana
for
a
leave
to
file
a
complaint
against
the
state
of
mississippi
based
upon
a
boundary
dispute
between
those
states
in
the
area
of
the
mississippi
river.
included
in
the
motion
is
a
prayer
that
all
proceedings
be
stayed
in
the
case
of
joseph
s.
zuccaro
et
al.
versus
humble
oil
&
refining
company,
which
is
civil
action
number
1011
on
the
docket
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
the
southern
--
the
western
division
of
the
southern
district
of
mississippi.
that
stay
is
requested
because
of
the
dominant
issue
in
that
case
as
to
the
location
of
a
producing
well
and
the
only
way
that
the
court
could
possibly
decide
this
case
would
be
to
decide
the
boundary
dispute
that
exist
between
mississippi
and
louisiana.
if
we
had
only
one
case
to
present
in
the
argument,
that
we
would
like
to
make
today,
it
is
durfree
versus
duke.
that
is
the
sole
substance
of
our
argument.
it
is
a
very
logical
opinion,
very
intelligently
presented
and
when
read
particularly
when
judge
--
when
mr.
justice
black's
concurring
opinion
is
read
with
it
then
i
think
we
have
the
answer
to
the
problem
as
presented
here
today.
now,
we
have
here
a
chart,
we
want
to
show
something
about
the
locale
of
this
dispute.
heights
rises,
its
circumstances
and
anything
that
the
court
may
be
interested
in.
realizing,
however,
that
we
are
here
asking
to
come
in
the
court,
we're
not
here
on
the
merits
but
as
i
take
it
from
this
very
learned
opinion
that
there's
only
one
way
or
two
ways
to
settle
a
boundary
dispute
between
states.
one
is
in
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court
and
the
other
one
is
in
a
compact
according
to
article
i,
section
10
of
the
constitution.
it
seems
to
me
that
so
far
as
our
motion
is
concerned,
we
--
we
certainly
should
not
have
to
sit
by
and
find
out
what
the
federal
district
court
in
mississippi
is
going
to
do
about
the
boundary.
so
we
have
no
forum
except
to
come
here.
now
--
mr.
john
l.
madden
we
--
we
could
mr.
justice
harlan
but
we
do
not
wish
to
because
we
will
find
ourselves
in
the
same
position
almost
as
if
mississippi
would
come
in
and
we
would
not
come
in.
you
see,
we
wouldn't
have
those
two
states
vis-a-vis
each
other,
contending
in
that
same
court
and
there
would
be
no
judgment
that
would
be
binding
it
if
louisiana
would
--
would
come
into
it,
then
the
judgment
down
there
would
not
be
binding
upon
the
state
of
mississippi.
now,
we
--
we
think
that
there
are
some
five
questions
that
we
should
go
into
as
briefly
or
as
fully
as
our
time
would
permit
and
if
the
court
directs
it,
one
does
have
jurisdiction,
then
properly
invoked.
second,
is
the
justiciable
controversy
presented.
third,
are
the
states
of
mississippi
and
louisiana,
the
real
parties
of
interest?
mr.
john
l.
madden
are
the
states
of
mississippi
and
louisiana,
the
real
parties
of
interest?
fourth,
does
the
complaint
state
a
cause
of
action?
fifth,
should
the
proceedings
in
the
united
states
district
court
be
stayed?
now,
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
is
invoked
of
course
under
article
iii,
clause
2,
paragraph
2
of
the
constitution
in
which
the
jurisdiction
is
conferred
upon
this
court
and
simply
which
the
state
is
a
party.
then
in
section
1251,
title
28,
united
states
code
annotated,
paragraph
81,
there
is
a
--
original
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
if
the
controversy
was
between
the
states.
now,
if
there
is
a
controversy
of
the
state
with
a
--
with
the
citizens
of
another
state
then
that
is
the
original
jurisdiction.
now
we
have
had
to
bring
in
as
defendants
in
this
case,
humble
oil
&
refining
company
which
is
louisiana's
own
lessee
and
the
zuccaros
who
are
claiming
the
land
in
mississippi.
i'll
get
into
that
in
a
minute
to
show
why
they're
claiming
to
this
water
bottoms
rather
than
a
--
than
the
state
of
mississippi
because
they
are
parties
down
then
the
suit
below
and
i
think
that
whether
they
are
essential
defendants
or
not,
they
certainly
should
be
nominal
defendants
in
here
to
present
any
objection
if
they
might
have
to
in
defining
of
this
complaint.
now,
i
have
here
by
my
side
and
to
the
back
of
me
an
easel
on
which
a
map
is
presented.
mr.
john
l.
madden
no
sir.
mr.
john
l.
madden
yes
and
--
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
think
i'll
have
to
clarify
that
answer
in
this
respect
and
that
louisiana
now
is
one
of
a
--
practically,
all
the
states
of
the
union
that
have
the
right
title
to
navigable
water
bottoms
by
raising
of
a
title
that
is
by
virtue
of
its
inherent
sovereignty
and
has
held
on
to
that.
but
in
mississippi,
the
riparian
owner
owns
the
thread
of
the
stream
whether
the
stream
is
navigable
or
not.
now
since
title
and
boundary
has
some
qualities
and
elements
that
together
or
still
we
do
not
say
that
the
zuccaros
are
indispensable
but
they're
certainly
--
if
we
could
distinguish
between
indispensable
and
unnecessary,
then
i
think
they
should
be
before
this
court.
they
and
the
state
of
mississippi
have
come
in
jointly
and
answered
it
or
rather
filed
an
objection
to
the
filing
of
this
complaint.
mr.
john
l.
madden
yes.
for
instance,
louisiana's
interest,
i
--
that
would
be
taken
up
in
time
by
my
co-counsel
but
louisiana
has
a
two-fold
interest
in
this
matter.
first,
is
proprietary
interest,
it
owns
these
navigable
water
bottoms
and
it
owns
this
producing
well,
that
is
the
--
that's
on
state
own
land
and
it
gets
ruined,
a
substantial
(inaudible).
at
the
same
time,
the
state
has
the
sovereignty
interest,
the
governmental
interest
that
--
of
regulating
the
production
of
the
well,
police
powers
and
all
of
those
are
powers
of
sovereignty.
now,
mississippi
has
those
two,
that's
why
they're
in
here
because
this
boundary
is
so
linked
up
with
the
question
of
a
--
of
its
jurisdiction
and
of
its
sovereignty
that
it
is
necessarily
a
party
before
this
court
and
an
--
an
indispensable
party
because
the
judgment
in
favor
of
louisiana
on
the
boundary
matter,
of
course
would
not
be
binding
anywhere
if
the
--
if
it
--
the
other
state
involved
was
not
before
the
court.
now,
i
want
to
get
to
--
this
is
not
presented,
may
it
please
the
court,
with
any
idea
in
mind
of
trying
to
take
–
to
state
louisiana's
position
on
any
controversial
issue
but
simply
to
show
the
court
the
locale.
now,
this
map
was
that
if
you're
--
to
some
(inaudible)
miles
above
natchez,
mississippi
and
it
run
going
down
for
about
40
miles
below.
now,
you
will
notice
very
large
loops
in
that
river
and
that's
not
just
common
to
that
particular
area
but
it's
all
the
way
from
cairo,
illinois
down
to
baton
rouge,
louisiana.
now
in
the
great
flood
of
1927,
the
corps
of
engineers
decided
that
they
were
going
to
have
to
devise
some
plan
of
shortcut
of
this
river
on
the
way
to
the
dock
and
there
were
some
15
cuts.
in
some
of
those
instances,
there
were
all
erosions,
man-made
erosions
but
it
made
no
particular
consequence
because
when
the
water
got
through
the
--
the
channel,
it
--
it
went
back
to
its
old
channel
and
so
there
wasn't
any
question
there
of
--
of
any
--
any
change
in
the
boundary.
now
we
get
to
this
glasscock
cutoff
right
here
which
is
one
of
the
most
tremendous
conversations
that
the
corps
of
engineers
have
--
have
--
have
ever
protected
and
tried
to
harness
these
waters
of
this
area
here.
now
this
area
is
called
(inaudible)
band
area,
that's
the
area
in
which
the
suit
of
esso
standard
versus
jones
were
decided
by
a
louisiana
court
in
which
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
because
this
case
here,
what
we
are
dealing
with
now
is
the
mississippi
river
not
an
old
flow
that
comes
through
here.
that
involved
the
esso
case
--
involved
a
question
of
where
the
state
owned
land
and
that
of
riparian
owners
ended,
and
again,
in
an
area
west
of
the
river.
now,
in
this
case,
when
this
--
the
water
started
and
comes
down
here
and
so
were
trying
to
get
the
(inaudible)
the
water
out
of
proposition.
the
water
was
going
very,
very
heavily
against
the
louisiana
bank.
the
plan
at
first
was
to
--
was
to
have
this
in
--
into
to
this
bank
of
the
mississippi
side
here
and
that
was
a
direct
channel
and
get
it
out
of
this
bend
but
they
found
out
after
many
years,
they
have
effort
that
it
was
too
resistant.
then
the
channel
went
at
great
speed
directly
across
where
you
can
see
the
green
line
here
in
this
part
of
the
river.
now
we
say
that
this
producing
well
was
drilled
on
louisiana
land.
we
do
not
even
say
now
that
this
well
or
is
not
in
louisiana
soil.
mr.
john
l.
madden
the
well,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
located
approximately
in
this
(inaudible)
mr.
john
l.
madden
my
point
is
this.
mr.
john
l.
madden
and
the
least
--
the
louisiana
stream
runs
out
on
the
dam
in
mississippi
river
into
(inaudible)
point
here.
mr.
john
l.
madden
yes.
now,
the
mississippi
says
that
this
well
is
in
mississippi
territory,
we
say
it's
louisiana.
but
now
we
have
--
we
say
this
that
if
that
well
has
--
is
in
the
state
of
mississippi
now,
then
it
was
brought
about
by
this
avulsive
action
of
a
tunnel
and
that
therefore,
the
original
boundary
should
not
be
stirred.
we're
not
getting
into
a
question
of
accretion.
accretion
is
not
involved
in
this
matter.
it's
the
underwater
beds
that's
involved
in
this
dispute.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
believe
i
haven't
got
a
minute
just
to
begin
probably
the
second
thought
of
the
argument
and
that's
on
the
--
on
the
justiciable
nature
of
the
controversy.
mr.
john
l.
madden
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
john
l.
madden
thank
you.
this
morning
in
trying
to
describe
the
area
and
that
was
about
all
i
was
trying
to
do
not
to
set
up
any
particular
process
where
we
might
locate
the
well
because
if
--
if
the
motion
is
granted,
then
we
go
to
a
special
mass
and
then
we
find
out
all
of
these
matters
on
the
merits.
but
i
referred
to
the
lease
this
morning
as
covering
an
area
since
in
here
all
the
way
down
here.
that
is
an
error.
suppose
that
the
fact
did
--
the
argument
i
was
making
was
at
the
time
to
get
this
water
out
of
this
(inaudible)
bend,
the
lease
that
we're
referring
to
sought
right
here
and
learn
toward
down
for
quite
some
distance
down
and
to
what
is
called
“deadman's
bend”.
now,
it's
not
all
the
--
mr.
chief
justice
warren
at
we
have
a
well
that's
located
i
think
it
--
if
my
worthy
opponents
will
permit
an
area
of
this
mass
of
thing
have
put
up
here
says
much,
we
can
give
you
a
better
idea
of
where
this
well
is
located.
now,
we
do
not
agree
that
that
is
the
exact
location
with
reference
to
its
boundary,
the
boundary
of
the
area.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
in
two
other
points,
i
would
like
to
bring
out
first
--
mr.
john
l.
madden
yes.
mr.
john
l.
madden
no,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
madden
no,
sir.
that
--
that
was
--
i
believe
it
flow
after
flow
of
1940-1941.
mr.
john
l.
madden
i
believe
that's
correct.
it
has
some
stream
columns
of
(inaudible)
but
i
think
the
river
itself
is
--
is
confederating
here
as
of
beyond
1940-1941
to
a
map
by
the
mississippi
river
commission.
the
reference
to
the
leasing
of
this
area
was
louisiana
as
the
owner
of
the
naval
flow
waterbeds
throughout
the
state.
then
the
lease
carter
oil
company
on
may
10th,
1948,
it
covered
a
large
area
as
i
have
indicated
here
of
the
mississippi
river
but
particularly
the
area
on
which
this
producing
well
is
located.
in
here,
annual
rentals
were
paid
until
drilling
again.
you
see
the
annual
drilling
was
the
cause
of
cessation
of
the
annual
rental
payment.
and
having
security
permit
to
drill
from
the
louisiana
department
of
conservation,
a
well
was
putted
in
on
march
the
2nd,
1954
at
a
site
on
the
west
bank
of
the
river
and
in
direction
with
drill.
of
course,
that
is
necessary
on
account
of
the
fact
they
can't
drill
in
this
if
the
river
does
not
permit
it.
and
at
a
point
which
at
that
time
and
since,
as
far
as
i
can
think
it
go,
the
well
is
on
the
--
it
was
bottom
under
the
river
on
the
louisiana
side
of
the
boundary.
the
well
was
completed
as
an
oil
producer
on
april
27th,
1954.
carter
and
humble
--
now
reported
carter
oil
company
and
humble
oil
and
refining
company
merged
on
december
the
1st,
1959.
and
from
that
time
forward
until
the
present
time,
humble
owns
the
lease.
all
royalties
were
paid
to
the
state
of
louisiana
from
production
as
one-eighth
on
oil
and
gas
and
other
liquid
hydrocarbons
until
february
1st,
1963.
the
suspension
went
into
effect
at
that
time
for
one
expressed
reason
and
one
only.
and
that
was
the
filing
of
the
zuccaros
case
down
in
the
federal
district
court
in
mississippi.
humble
simply
quit
paying
the
state
royalties.
now,
that
is
the
condition
of
the
--
in
the
history
of
the
leasing
in
this
particular
area.
now,
throughout
--
this
is
not
the
only
well
in
the
area.
it's
only
one
in
the
stream
here
in
this
particular
area
of
the
river.
now,
this
in
production
all
around
in
this
area
here
someday
have
been
some
dry
oil,
some
producing
oil
wells,
some
producing
gas
well.
so
it's
not
--
it's
not
located
simply
in
an
area
that
just
has
one
well,
but
it
just
happens
to
be
that
this
one
well
is
there
in
exact
disputed
territory
between
mississippi
and
louisiana.
mr.
john
l.
madden
i
think,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
it
should
cover
an
area
of
that
of
--
i
would
say
of
about
12
miles
of
--
beginning
here
at
the
glasscock
cut
and
running
down
here
all
the
way
--
all
the
way
down
up
to
the
end
of
this
--
this
particular
bend.
now,
the
reason
to
that
is
this.
you
might
find
some
area
down
here,
i
don't
know.
we
haven't
gone
down
that
far
where
mississippi
may
gain
some
land.
mr.
john
l.
madden
may
gain
some
land
as
a
result
of
imperceptible
accretion.
mr.
john
l.
madden
yes,
we
--
we
mentioned
that
whole
area
in
the
complaint
but
we
did
not
make
amidst
in
bound
description
of
it.
we
just
refer
to
this
general
bend
area
of
that
deadman's
bend.
mr.
john
l.
madden
that
--
that's
true.
mr.
john
l.
madden
yes,
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
l.
madden
we
--
we
say
that
it
is
affected
by
if
it
has
been
affected
at
all.
now,
mississippi
takes
the
position
that
this
way
only
been
mississippi.
we
say
that
it's
still
in
louisiana
but
that
if
there
has
been
any
change
in
the
location
of
this
well
which
would
throw
the
thalweg,
a
wave
on
the
other
side
of
the
well,
then
it
has
been
caused
by
this
man-made
avulsion.
mr.
john
l.
madden
that's
right.
that's
correct.
now,
turning
to
the
question
of
a
justiciable
controversy,
mississippi
and
its
opposition
had
referred
us
to
a
number
of
cases.
we
refer
to
them,
ourselves,
as
being
--
some
of
them
as
being
requiring
review
test
those
other
small
labor.
for
instance,
we
have
cases
here
in
which
--
in
arkansas
versus
texas
which
says
that
the
court
go
out
of
reaches
behind.
it's
behind
the
nature
of
the
controversy
and
beyond
its
palm
to
find
out
the
state's
reapportionment
in
that.
and
then
we
have
another
case,
an
old
case
of
--
of
connecticut
versus
massachusetts
which
says
that
the
supreme
court
will
not
exert
power
to
control
conduct
of
one
state
at
two
of
another
unless
threaten
invasion
of
rights
is
serious
and
clearly
established.
then
the
case
of
texas
versus
florida,
we
have
an
alternative
proposition.
either
the
complaining
state
must
have
received
some
harm
or
injury
from
the
other
state
or
there
must
be
a
right,
a
substantial
right
involved
that
is
in
jeopardy
and
a
right
that
could
be
imposed.
but
the
point
that
i
wish
to
emphasize
on
court
is
after
reading
these
actions
on
original
boundaries
in
this
court,
i
don't
find
any
harm
or
injury
mentioned.
nothing
is
having
anything
to
do
with
it.
it's
just
a
question.
is
this
dispute
there?
does
it
exist?
is
it
real?
you
don't
have
to
have
an
arm
conflict.
you
don't
have
to
go
as
far
as
the
--
this
court
acted
very
quickly
at
one
time
and
saving
that
these
two
states
against
almost
to
all
conflict
back
in
1901.
there
were
case
in
201,
202
louisiana
1.
but
now,
one
or
two
of
the
cases
i
mentioned
now
i
have
taken
party
in
this
scope.
we
have
a
bill
of
complaint
here
in
the
last
case
between
mississippi
and
louisiana
decided
by
this
court
in
1955.
i
have
before
me
the
complaint,
the
bill
of
complaints.
at
bill
of
complaints
says
just
about
this,
that
a
controversy
has
risen
in
the
complainant,
state
of
mississippi
and
the
said
state
of
louisiana
that
a
few
portion
of
the
borderline
between
the
two
states
that
no
agreement
has
been
reached
and
can
be
reached
so
we
are
having
to
invoke
the
original-jurisdiction
of
this
court.
now,
we
are
trying
to
say
that
all
of
these
harm
and
injury
and
of
all
of
this
acuteness,
these
behemoths
between
the
states
very
severe
pressure
in
the
regulatory
power
simply
is
not
required
in
this
boundary
actions.
now,
you
take
the
case
hereof
mississippi
versus
louisiana
which
is
decided
in
1928.
there
this
court
said
the
record
sustains
the
master's
finding
that
there
is
no
proof
that
louisiana
or
its
citizens
knew
of
or
every
east
in
any
purported
dominion
of
mississippi
over
the
disputed
territory.
and
it
went
on
--
and
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
the
first
knowledge
of
the
complainant's
witnesses
knew
anything
about
the
dispute,
derivable
action
was
filed.
now,
in
this
case,
mississippi
there
is
not
saying
that
a
boundary
does
not
--
that
a
dispute
does
not
exist.
it
simply
says
that
this
is
not
justiciable
enough
to
burden
this
court
with
it
or
words
to
that
effect.
well,
if
--
if
a
controversy
is
justiciable
and
that
the
boundaries
in
dispute,
i
don't
see
where
you
can
drive
and
decide
on
the
weight
of
the
controversy
in
deciding
whether
or
not
the
jurisdiction
held
this
court
should
be
exercised.
now,
they
jointly
deprive
interest
in
opposing
louisiana's
motion
to
file
a
complaint
and
it
said
on
page
7
of
the
opposition,
“we
do
not
relinquish
any
right
or
title
that
we
have
to
this
area.”
now,
if
they
don't
relinquish
it
and
--
and
pour
that
up,
then
they
are
claiming
it
and
they're
claiming
it
against
the
state
of
louisiana.
we
believe
that
a
justiciable
controversy
has
been
presented
and
the
other
requirements
of
whether
a
reasonable
action
had
been
made
and
i
wished
to
turn
over
the
remaining
of
our
time
to
my
co-counsel.
i
think
he
would
discuss
the
question
of
east
mississippi
--
east
louisiana
the
reported
in
this
case.
and
that
is
a
question
and
further
has
a
cause
of
action
had
been
stated.
we
think
that
required
the
court
of
our
pleading
that
must
be
examined.
mr.
john
l.
madden
--
back
to
the
stream.
mr.
john
l.
madden
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices
of
this
honorable
court.
a
first
few
words
that
i
shall
say
will
--
i
will
--
ameliorating
to
this
court,
because
i
said
substantially
the
same
thing
i
gave
before
standing
before
this
court
when
i
had
the
privilege
of
doing
so
i
introduced
the
argument
in
this
manner,
my
recollection
of
how
we
came
into
this
court
and
why.
and
we
have
a
new
justice
on
the
supreme
court
in
the
meantime.
and
i'll
just
simply
say
that
this
controversy
had
its
inception
in
a
suit
that
was
filed
by
certain
mississippi
landowners
and
a
district
court
of
the
united
states
in
mississippi.
it
was
directed
solely
against
humble
oil
and
refining
company,
louisiana's
mineral
lessee.
the
mississippi
landowners
alleged
in
their
complaint,
as
they
were
the
owners
of
an
oil
well
which
was
drilled
by
carter
oil
company
which
merged
with
humble
oil
on
december
the
1st,
1959.
under
its
lease
from
the
drill
site
in
louisiana
to
an
oil
producing
zone
and
bottomed
in
the
bed
of
the
mississippi
river.
plaintiffs,
mr.
carrols
and
carrols
(ph)
family
claimed
that
the
oil
well
was
producing
within
the
state
of
mississippi
from
lands
which
they
had
come
to
own
by
a
reason
now
were
shift
in
the
main
channel
of
the
mississippi
river.
the
title
to
louisiana's
property
having
been
attacked
in
that
suit,
louisiana
filed
a
motion,
this
honorable
court
believed
to
file
a
complaint
and
all
that
the
court
did
before
this
court,
the
only
tribunal
that
could
pass
on
all
of
the
issues.
and
we
made
as
defendants,
the
state
of
mississippi,
the
mississippi
landowners
now
lessees
on
them
giving
everyone
the
right
to
come
in
and
be
heard
subject
to
granting
the
pleading
granted
by
this
court.
the
united
states
district
judge
issued
an
order
staying
the
proceedings
in
the
federal
district
court
with
all
of
the
necessary
parties
both
public
and
private
being
before
this
court
after
leave
was
granted
to
file
a
complaint,
this
court
in
our
--
in
its
order
that
we
interpreted
it,
accept
the
jurisdiction
for
all
purposes.
the
special
master
then
conducted
hearings,
took
evidence
and
heard
all
authorities,
both
private
and
public
wishing
to
be
heard.
he
has
filed
his
report
and
we
are
here
on
exceptions
to
that
report.
it
is
my
purpose
to
state
the
facts
in
this
original
action,
particularly
all
of
the
controlling
facts
on
which
louisiana
predicates
its
exceptions
to
the
special
master
report,
the
effects
in
this
case
dominate
because
they
are
unprecedented
in
boundary
actions
heretofore
decided
by
this
honorable
court.
my
associate
counsel,
mr.
carmouche
shall
follow
me
to
discuss
the
existing
jurisprudence
and
the
legal
phases
of
the
court.
it
is
appropriate
to
say
at
the
start
that
louisiana
concurs
fully
in
all
of
the
truly
important
parts
of
the
special
master's
findings
of
fact.
in
his
illuminating
résumé
of
facts
highlighting
his
report,
the
special
master
lightens
the
mississippi
river
to
assert
between
carlyle,
illinois
and
the
gulf
of
mexico,
referring
of
course
to
the
continuous
bends
or
loops
near
the
river
extending
ultimately
from
east
to
west
throughout
the
descent
of
the
river
and
in
widening
its
way
to
the
gulf
of
mexico.
the
expert
witnesses
at
the
hearings
conducted
by
the
special
master,
agreed
that
the
deepest
part
of
the
river
by
the
channel
is
in
the
concave
portion
of
the
--
where
the
force
of
the
river
strikes
hard
against
the
bank
causing
erosion
and
caving.
while
across
the
river,
in
the
convex
area,
where
the
water
is
shallow
accretion
is
formed
to
the
bank.
they
explained
that
the
river
in
the
concave
area
crosses
over
to
the
next
bend
in
the
concave
area
and
then
again
following
its
course
downstream.
now
material
from
the
concave
bank
is
deposited
on
the
next
convex
bank.
caving
is
the
result
of
the
direction
of
a
channel
against
the
concave
bank
where
the
deepest
portion
of
the
river
is
found.
scouring
may
take
place
in
the
deeper
portion
of
the
river
where
there
are
high
velocities.
if
the
banks
are
composed
of
homogenous
material,
the
expert
say
that
bends
are
rather
uniform.
however,
resistant
material
such
as
clay
or
clay
deposits
when
encountered
by
river
action
form
a
bank
called
a
false
keep
or
hard
point.
and
where
there
are
such
tough
or
resistant
soil
have
been
developed
slowly
and
is
partly
controlled
in
configuration
by
that
soil.
clay
pugs
are
characterized
as
cohesive
hanging
together
forming
a
resistant
mass
to
any
channel
obscuring
action
of
the
river,
and
are
quite
thick.
the
experts
reported
crossings
in
the
river
as
extending
to
relatively
straight
regions.
they
are
located
almost
invariably
up
and
downstream
on
the
--
in
the
river.
and
in
those
places
where
the
navigator
goes
from
one
deep
area
to
another
and
in
that
is
a
crossing
and
in
that
crossing
the
water
is
much
shallower
than
it
is
in
the
deeper
portion.
mr.
john
l.
madden
--
made
reference
to
crossings
to
the
area
where
the
navigator
goes
from
one
deep
water
area
that
follows
a
bend
over
to
the
next
concave
bank.
and
in
this
crossing
area,
we
have
brought
out
that
that
the
water
is
generally
shallow
in
there.
now
the
only
purpose
of
that
is
to
show
the
court
the
difference
between
your
conclave
and
your
convex
bank
and
then
you
cross
from
one
area
to
the
other.
now
in
that
crossing,
of
course
the
water
is
shallow.
you're
not
following
the
deepest
water
because
the
deepest
water
is
where
you're
trying
to
reach.
now
proceeding
from
that
point,
i
would
like
to
say
that
throughout
the
expert
testimony,
exceeding
stress
was
placed
on
the
high
importance
of
clay
deposits
found
in
the
banks
of
meandering
streams.
the
experts
explained
this
tough
material
not
only
slows
down
the
formation
and
development
of
bends,
it
has
in
affect
on
the
configuration,
it
may
elongate
--
negate
it,
they
won't
be
uniform
bends.
at
the
--
then
it
also
appreciatively
affects
the
control
of
the
direction
of
the
channel
flow.
it
is
of
exceeding
importance,
may
it
please
the
court
it
will
bear
this
clay
plug
as
resistant
soil
in
mine
as
i
further
reveal
the
facts
in
the
case.
and
we
are
going
to
cling
as
close
as
we
can
to
the
language
of
the
special
master
in
this
matter
and
that's
why
--
course
of
the
remaining
portion
of
my
part
of
the
argument
shall
be
in
quotation
from
that
because
i
want
to
link
it
in
with
the
certain
conclusions
we
reach
to
the
end.
on
pages
6
and
7,
there
is
a
report,
the
special
master
says
that,
“at
flood
time,
this
bends,
those
meandering
loops,
grow
even
larger
by
the
accelerated
river
action.
increase
the
overall
length
of
the
river
where
the
corresponding
decrease
in
the
speed
of
the
flow.
and
the
greatest
slope
can
be
obtained
by
a
cutoff
across
the
neck
thus
increasing
the
rapidity
of
the
river.
the
slowing
down
of
the
flow
is
a
direct
cause
of
flooding.”
“and
so
attempts,”
the
special
master
says,
"have
been
made
to
alleviate
this
by
constructing
cutoff
or
bypass
bends."
the
special
master
requires
of
course
to
the
action
taken
by
the
mississippi
river
commission
under
the
guidance
and
the
engineer
in
experience
of
the
united
state
corps
of
engineer.
in
19
--
in
the
late
1920s
and
the
early
19
--
other
in
the
1930s,
in
their
effort
to
improve
flood
control
and
navigation
on
the
mississippi
river
by
the
constructions
of
these
cutoffs,
that
plan
called
for
the
construction
of
15
cutoffs
and
those
cutoffs
have
been
constructed.
between
memphis,
tennessee
and
about
20
miles
south
of
natchez,
mississippi
in
what
is
referred
to
as
the
deer
park
area.
this
is
getting
in
a
proximity
here
of
the
cut
that
we're
speaking
of
and
it
includes
this
glasscock
cutoff.
it
was
one
of
the
areas,
one
of
the
longest.
deer
--
now,
i'm
going
to
ask
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
diagram
that
it
appears
here.
i
regret,
apologize
to
the
court
that
this
is
not
larger
in
the
larger
lettering.
but
we
have
a
little
bit
hard
to
anticipate
just
to
the
division
from
the
sides.
but
we
have
a
lettering
on
here
and
i
don't
know
whether
they
can
be
seen
from
the
bench
or
not,
but
here
is
a
letter
y,
it
runs
around
to
a
letter
h
and
then
to
j
and
to
a,
b,
c,
x,
z
and
on
this
side
b
to
x.
now,
there
is
a

mr.
john
l.
madden
yes
sir,
may
it
please
the
court.
that's
on
page
7,
i
believe
--
mr.
john
l.
madden
yes
sir.
now
there's
a
--
mr.
john
l.
madden
yes.
mr.
john
l.
madden
that
--
mr.
john
l.
madden
this
is
approximately
the
same
draft,
similar
to
a
draft.
and
this
was
placed
in
the
brief
for
a
different
point
altogether
in
what
i'm
discussing
now.
and
this
was
placed
in
the
brief
to
show
some
kind
of
balancing
effect
of
the
river
action
and
the
compensating
effect
brought
about
by
the
cut.
the

mr.
john
l.
madden
yes.
mr.

yes

now
the
missi
--
mr.
john
l.
madden
yes
sir.
mr.
john
l.
madden
that's
correct.
now,
you
have
--
mr.
john
l.
madden
yes
sir.
mr.
john
l.
madden
now,
you
have
a
wide
sweep
of
the
mississippi
river
or
you
did
have.
beginning
at
the
point
y
here,
going
over
on
the
louisiana
side
and
it
came
on
down
here
to
the
point
and
then
went
on
out
over
here
out
of
point
x,
the
way
i
argue
--
i
followed
it
with
my
ruler.
now
--
mr.
john
l.
madden
yes
sir.
now,
such
--
you
have
this
wide
sweep
and
then
it's
kind
of
balanced
downstream
by
the
smallest
sweep
to
the
west
toward
mississippi
which
is
the
dead
mans
bend.
now,
those
two
bends
have
been
moving
in
opposite
directions
since
the
first
recorded
surveys
of
this
area
in
1860
--
in
1765.
now
the
united
states
engineers
decided
to
construct
a
4-mile
trench,
running
from
the
point
of
mark
y
to
point
of
b,
that's
a
distance
of
approximately
4
miles
and
that
is
what
is
called
glasscock
cutoff.
now
--
and
that
bypass
is
generally
referred
to
and
it's
correctly
they
describe
as
the
glasscock
cutoff
which
goes
from
y
to
b.
and
this
b
is
the
intersection
line
here
--
is
the
line
--
is
the
point
where
the
old
bend
of
deer
park
bend
comes
through
here,
point
a
and
then
continues
in
the
stretch
of
the
thalweg
prior
to
the
cutoff.
it
goes
around
and
sweeps
to
the
east
and
goes
from
point
b
to
c
and
then
c
to
x.
now,
the
vast
changes
that
took
place
in
connection
with
the
cutoff
weren't
completely
visible.
the
drag
in
by
the
engineers
was
clearly
perceptible,
so
where
with
the
tons
and
tons
of
material
that
was
dredged
out
in
deposits
on
the
then
existing
banks.
before
the
entrance
the
deer
park
dam
were
shut
off
and
now
you
find
trees,
well
the
trees
go
in
there.
you
have
a
material
flopping
in
this
area,
very
acute
slope,
where
there
was
a
160
acres
that
caved
in.
now
throughout
that
cut,
it
is
inescapable
and
it
would've
been
inescapable
to
anyone
watching
it,
the
things
that
it
progressed
in
that
area.
so
we
can't
say
that
this
action
was
incapable
of
perception
--
mr.
john
l.
madden
a
what?
incapable
of
perception,
that
you
couldn't
see
it.
now
on
pages
46
and
47
of
his
report,
the
special
master
has
this
to
say,
"the
original
plan
of
the
engineers
was
to
excavate
a
narrow
4-mile
pilot
channel,
across
the
neck
and
then
to
permit
the
natural
scouring
effects
of
the
river
to
complete
the
cutoff
by
moving
through
the
cut
in
ever
increasing
amounts.
the
pilot
channel
was
dug
in
the
early
1933
and
had
a
slight
curve
in
the
middle.
so
it
can
direct
the
flow
into
dead
mans
bend
on
a
course
approximately
south.
still
quoting
from
the
report,
"if
the
cutoff
once
developed
by
the
river
was
to
maintain
its
pre-planed
course,
it
was
essential
that
there
be
uniform
caving
on
both
banks
of
the
cut."
"this
did
not
occur,”
the
special
master
says.
instead,
the
highly
resistant
clay
deposit
that
we've
reaffirmed
with.
in
this
area
about
where
my
ruler
is
pointing.
mr.
john
l.
madden
instead,
the
highly
resistant
clay
deposits
which
engineers
encountered
in
the
middle
of
the
cut.
(inaudible)
to
take
a
course
somewhat
west
of
south.
and
thus
it
eroded
a
less
resistant
bank
of
the
lower
western
side.
instead
of
the
water
coming
around
here
and
getting
in
this
sweep
than
it
--
the
water
started
in
this
direction
here
hard
against
the
louisiana
bay.
still
reporting
from
the
special
master,
aside
from
this
unexpected
development
in
the
construction
of
glasscock
cutoff,
it
was
also
a
considerable
delay
in
its
final
completion.
this
delay
was
caused
mainly
by
the
same
clay
deposit
which
continued
to
settle
back
into
the
cut
act
--
excavation.
for
this
reason,
the
cutoff
did
not
carry
an
annual
average
of
more
than
50%
of
the
flow
until
about
1941,
eight
years
after
they
commenced
with
the
construction.
mr.
john
l.
madden
i
am
leading
up
--
i
think
the
best
way
to
answer
that
mr.
chief
justice
to
say
that
i'm
staying
with
the
facts
that
the
special
master
found.
but
i
am
laying
the
foundation
to
be
followed
by
my
co-counsel
and
arguing
that
certain
conclusions
of
law
reached
by
the
special
master
should
not
be
followed
by
this
court.
mr.
john
l.
madden
mr.
chief
justice,
in
preparing
this
argument
originally,
it
was
my
idea
to
single
out
each
four
witnesses.
but
then,
i
decided
that
the
thing
to
do
was
to
find
out
what
they
all
agreed
to.
and
then
i'd
say
what
the
experts
say.
in
other
words,
what
i
am
saying
now
in
my
judgment
after
reading
the
transcript,
all
of
the
experts
agree
upon
the
court.
mr.
john
l.
madden
yes.
mr.
john
l.
madden
now,
the
special
master
then
goes
on
to
say
in
his
report
and
that's
in
page
51.
it
was
conceded
by
all
the
experts
and
is
--
excuse
me
for
interrupting
with
this
quotation,
but
the
special
masters
is
doing
here
what
i
am
trying
to
do
with
my
arguments,
to
follow
the
uniform
expression
of
opinion
by
the
experts.
“it
was
conceded
by
all
the
experts
in
dead
mans
bend
would
have
continued
to
migrate
eastward
and
to
mississippi
--”
mr.
john
l.
madden
it
isn't
on
page
51?
mr.
john
l.
madden
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon
sir,
it's
on
page
40,
i'm
sorry.
would've
continued
to
migrate
eastward
into
mississippi
had
it
not
been
for
the
construction
of
glasscock
cutoff.
hence,
but
for
the
construction
of
the
cutoff,
the
well
today
would
have
been
well
within
louisiana.
now
if
your
honor
pleased,
if
you
can
turn
to
page
51,
there
is
this
quotation
from
the
special
master.
“the
elimination
of
historical
dead
mans
bend
has
called
an
erosion
into
louisiana
in
a
--
an
accretion
of
aluminum
to
mississippi
in
the
first
three
miles
below
cut.”
now
there's
three
miles
below
the
cut
is
the
problem
here.
now
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
railway
had
been
left
alone,
there
would
not
have
been
any
cut
at
all
because
of
this
highly
resistant
soil.
now
--
the
parties
to
this
action
and
the
special
master
agree
that
the
boundary
around
here
is
--
it's
been
fixed.
and
the
--
then
special
master
and
all
of
the
witnesses
agree
where
the
old
channel
was
that
follows
from
a,
b,
c,
x.
then
there
has
also
have
been
agreed
by
stipulating
between
the
counsel
that
the
previous
main
channel
runs
along
the
line
b,
x.
now,
special
master
had
no
particular
difficulty
in
reaching
the
vast
majority
of
his
findings
but
he
had
difficulty
in
certain
combinations
of
course
that
were
no
river
surveys
from
1942
to
1951
and
now
from
1952
to
1954.
it
was
particularly
difficult
for
him
to
try
to
locate
the
position
of
the
thalweg
with
relation
to
the
well
during
certain
years.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
want
to
say
it
very
briefly
before
i
close
that
we
have
arrived
at
four
major
conclusions
in
connection
with
the
facts
that
have
been
found
with
the
special
master.
first,
that
where
in
an
action
of
this
kind
the
cutoff
is
constructed
by
the
united
states
engineers
through
the
use
of
artificial
means
and
the
direction
of
the
current
has
been
changed
so
drastically
as
to
eliminate
an
entire
(inaudible)
bend
after
creating
instead
in
reverse
bend.
then
the
boundaries
should
remain
where
it
was
before
the
construction
--
before
it
was
started.
mr.
john
l.
madden
that
sir
will
be
discussed
by
mr.
carmouche
but
this
court
is
not
held
that.
i
don't
think
you
have
a
case
mr.
justice
black.
second,
human
agencies
should
not
be
able
to
bring
about
results
that
acts
of
nature
cannot
alone
accomplish.
the
drastic
changes
made
by
the
united
states
engineers
in
diverting
the
direction
of
the
channel
out
of
glasscock
cutoff
reversing
the
direction
of
the
flow
is
not
a
thing
that
nature
could
have
been
done
alone.
now,
if
a
certain
minor
changes
have
made
where
nature
could
do
it
alone,
man
could
do
it,
then
the
states
are
expected
to
resign
emissaries
to
this
minor
changes
but
when
a
man
comes
in
and
completely
ignores
the
nature
and
does
that
which
nature
cannot
do,
then
we
think
that
states
like
louisiana
in
an
action
of
this
kind
has
the
right
to
question
some
of
the
old
concepts
of
avulsion.
the
terms
used
and
the
semantics
in
connection
with
--
before
the
third
point,
i'd
like
to
make
is
that
--
and
the
conclusion
we
reach
is
that
we
are
living
now
in
a
time
when
united
states
had
been
setup
upon
a
number
of
years
on
a
wide
scale,
river
improvement
program
to
assist
in
flood
control
and
wide
scale
improvement
of
navigation.
you
don't
have
situations
now
that
you
had
years
ago
when
we
talk
about
accretion
from
the
standpoint
of
--
mr.
john
l.
madden
did
it
take
the
sending
(inaudible)?
and
those
old
that
came
up
when
it
took
to
an
american
jurisprudence.
now
that
fourth
and
the
last
--
final
point
that
i
would
like
to
make,
our
conclusion
is
that
the
solemnity
of
long
existing
state
boundaries
and
the
propriety
rights
therein
acquired
invested
interest
therein
created,
protect
it
and
preserve.
now,
as
you're
going
to
follow
in
situations
of
this
kind
of
(inaudible).
you're
not
protecting
those
innocent
at
all
and
you're
not
coping
with
modern
day
conditions
of
exigencies.
there's
no
exception
in
the
substantive
law
after
boundaries
of
space
may
not
be
altered
except
by
compacts
between
states
ratified
by
congress.
now,
if
the
states
without
congressional
approval
and
congress
acting
unilaterally
cannot
alter
state
boundary
then
it
seems
to
us
to
be
unthinkable
that
the
united
states
engineers
may
change
boundaries
and
destroy
titles.
thank
you.
