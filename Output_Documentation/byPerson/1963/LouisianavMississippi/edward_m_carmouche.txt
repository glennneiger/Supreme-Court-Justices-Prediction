mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
thank
you.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
my
colleague
has
illustrated
them
in
the
first
30
minutes
that
a
conflict
actually
does
exist
between
the
state
of
louisiana
and
the
state
of
mississippi.
and
this
is
the
only
form
that
can
finally
determine
the
controversy
been
in
exist
between
the
two
states.
we
feel
that
there
is
considerably
more
involved
in
this
suit
from
the
fact
that
we
have
just
lost
our
royalties.
mississippi
seems
to
infer
in
her
brief
that
this
is
a
very
unimportant
thing
and
that
said
she
is
not
exercising
her
regulatory
powers
of
this
term
that
there's
really
no
controversy.
but
when
you
stop
to
think
about
it,
of
course,
this
well
has
produced
to
date
almost
a
million
dollars
worth
of
oil.
it's
still
producing
and
we
hope
that
it
will
continue
to
produce
for
a
long
time.
but
that's
not
the
--
the
sole
issue.
there
are
many
other
wells
located
in
this
area.
now,
as
my
colleague
pointed
out
prior
to
this
avulsion,
prior
to
the
cut
being
made
by
the
united
states
engineers
at
glasscock,
the
current
in
the
mississippi
river
was
flowing
east
to
the
bank
of
mississippi
river.
that
meant
that
erosion,
if
left,
the
natural
processes
would've
continued
to
move
east
and
we
would've
been
cutting
farther
and
farther
into
the
state
of
mississippi.
the
united
states
engineers
in
making
this
cut
and
i
may
point
out
here
that
when
we
are
referred
to
our
master
that
we
can
prove
and
will
rely
on
the
fact
(inaudible)
one
of
the
earliest
cuts
made
by
the
engineers
that
they
didn't
know
quite
is
much
about
the
subject
as
they
do
today.
and
by
mistake,
that
cut
was
made
in
such
a
way
that
you
--
part
of
the
current,
instead
of
being
directed
towards
mississippi,
it
now
bounces
all
towards
the
louisiana
bank
and
we
know
that
that
thalweg
will
continue
to
move
westward.
so,
we
have
other
areas,
other
wells
affected
in
this
suit
of
the
companies
and
we
believe
that
all
of
these
things
are
at
issue
and
cannot
be
decided
unless
this
court
takes
jurisdiction.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
yes,
sir.
that
is
probably
the
preferred
definition
by
this
court.
also,
there
had
been
many
definitions
about
thalweg
in
the
past.
we
readily
admit
that
the
thalweg
is
usually
the
boundary
as
east
mississippi's
contention.
and
if
you
will
leave
to
nature
that
thalweg
would
be
the
boundary,
the
middle
in
the
main
channel.
but
in
an
avulsive
situation,
the
opposite
is
true.
if
this
is
an
avulsion,
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again
that
the
boundary
is
the
thalweg
as
it
existed
immediately
prior
to
the
avulsion.
and
so
we
feel,
therefore,
that
this
movement
to
the
west
does
not
affect
their
boundary,
it
cannot
affect
their
boundary
and
that
we
have
a
controversy
before
you.
now,
louisiana
and
mississippi
are
the
real
parties
and
the
interest
in
this
controversy.
louisiana's
claim
here
is
both
proprietary
and
governmental
in
nature.
as
my
colleague
stated
under
louisiana
law,
the
state
owns
all
navigable
waterbeds
to
its
boundary.
mississippi,
the
riparian
owner
owns
rather
than
the
state.
our
state
is
entitled
to
all
royalties
that
are
payable
from
wells
that
are
located
on
the
beds
of
navigable
waters.
and
until
the
zuccaros
has
filed
this
suit,
we
were
receiving
those
royalties.
then
about
three
months
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint,
before
this
honorable
court,
on
the
law
of
cease
paying
our
royalties
because
of
the
cloud
that
had
been
cast
on
our
title
by
the
zuccaros.
now,
in
addition
to
this
proprietary
claim
of
--
of
louisiana,
we
are
also
acting
in
a
sovereign
capacity
in
regulating
this
territory.
the
state
of
louisiana
issued
the
permit
to
drill
this
well.
the
state
of
louisiana
granted
this
lease
to
humble
oil
and
refining
company.
the
state
of
louisiana
set
the
allowable
on
this
well.
we
have
exercised
all
police
powers,
the
--
the
exercise
up
until
the
filing
of
this
suit.
now,
we
also
have
exercised
our
sovereign
capacity
of
collecting
all
taxes
such
as
severance
taxes
and
ad
valorem
taxes
on
the
property
involved.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
they
are
held
in
esso,
yes.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
not
in
court,
but
almost
simply
refused
to
pay
us
our
royalties
because
this
suit
is
pending
against
us
and
in
the
event
the
zuccaros
when
this
suit
in
mississippi
in
the
district
court,
then
naturally
our
title
will
be
in
dispute.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
yes.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
now,
if
this
court
does
not
take
jurisdiction,
it's
quite
easy
to
see
what's
going
to
happen.
if
a
mississippi
jury
approval
determines
in
this
damage
suit
that
this
land
lies
on
the
state
of
mississippi
and
they've
got
to
reach
that
position
in
order
to
give
damages
for
trespass
then,
do
you
think
that
the
state
of
mississippi
is
going
to
sit
on
the
fact
and
not
collect
severance
taxes?
that
they
will
not
attempt
to
regulate
the
flow
of
this
well?
that
they
will
not
set
units?
we're
going
to
have
a
multiplicity
of
suits
out
of
this
unless
this
court
ceases
jurisdiction
as
it
should
on
the
prior
jurisprudence.
the
fact
that
mississippi
has
not
exercised
any
of
these
powers
today
is
meaningless
as
long
as
there
is
a
possibility
that
they
might
exercise
it,
our
title
will
always
be
clouded.
now,
my
colleague
mentioned
that
a
mileage
of
some
12
to
15
miles
is
affected
by
this
avulsion.
now,
that's
considerably
more
property
than
the
zuccaros
own.
but
being
fundamentally
and
all
company
attorney
and
attorney
for
the
state,
member
of
board,
it's
quite
easy
to
see
that
nobody
is
going
to
make
any
beds
and
by
any
leases
in
that
area
until
this
situation
is
straightened
up.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
nobody
--
sir?
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
no,
the
zuccaros
say
it's
in
mississippi.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
no,
they
simply
say
that
they
reserved
all
of
their
rights
which
is
tantamount
for
saying
if
the
zuccaros
win,
we're
going
to
step
in.
we're
going
to
let
zuccaro
fight
our
battle
for
us
and
if
he
wins,
then
we'll
lose.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
they
reserve
their
rights
which
i
think
that's
a
correct
statement,
yes.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
yes,
sir,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
the
question
of
jurisdiction
of
this
honorable
court
should
rest
with
what
mississippi
wants
to
do.
their
decision
to
litigate
or
not
litigate
is
completely
immaterial.
the
question
involved
before
this
court
is,
does
a
boundary
dispute
exist?
is
it
real?
is
it
substantial?
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
that's
right.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
so
you
can
see
why
they
would
prefer
to
sit
back
and
fight
this
in
another
day.
but
if
the
zuccaros
win,
they'll
tax
our
well.
now,
what's
going
to
happen
in
louisiana?
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
yes.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
no,
sir,
it
is
paying
taxes.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
yes,
sir.
now,
here
is
our
position.
in
the
event
that
you
allow
this
mississippi
jury
who
would
naturally
be
biased
to
determine
whether
this
land
is
in
louisiana
or
mississippi,
from
that
moment
on,
these
powers
can
be
exercised
by
the
state
of
louisiana.
now,
what's
the
humble
going
to
do
to
us?
they
paid
out
all
of
these
losses
over
the
past
years.
we
feel
that
certainly
humble
would
sue
us
for
back
raw
offense,
for
back
severance
taxes.
they
would
destroy
the
unit
because
if
this
land
is
in
mississippi,
louisiana
had
no
authority
to
sell
a
unit.
what
about
the
money
that
they
paid
us
as
a
lease
bonus
when
they
purchased
this
lease,
the
rentals
that
they
pay
prior
to
drilling
the
well?
they're
just
a
multiplicity
of
problems
involved
in
this
thing
in
the
mere
assertion
of
jurisdiction
is
immaterial,
i
think,
to
the
court
today.
now,
the
very
fact
that
the
state
of
mississippi
is
here
acting
jointly
with
the
zuccaros
evidence
is
their
interest
in
this
controversy.
they
are
here
primarily
in
a
capacity
of
parens
patriae.
as
you
pointed
out
in
kentucky
versus
indiana,
the
appropriate
appearance
here
of
a
state
by
its
proper
officers
either
as
a
complainant
or
defendant
is
conclusive
on
this
point.
now,
mississippi
takes
the
position
that
this
is
a
private
controversy
between
the
zuccaros
and
humble.
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth.
they
state
even
further
that
we're
appearing
here
on
behalf
of
humble.
louisiana's
interest
in
this
matter
is
that
of
lessor
to
lessee.
we
have
an
additional
interest
in
that
these
royalties
ceased
being
paid
to
us
as
i
pointed
out.
i
pointed
out
some
of
the
consequences
that
would
occur
in
the
event
that
the
zuccaros
either
win
or
do
not
win
their
case.
we're
going
to
have
suits
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
this
district
--
of
this
mississippi
jury's
verdict
as
to
the
ownership
of
this
land.
and
only
last
week,
it's
seem
conclusive
to
us
that
when
this
court
rule
in
the
case
of
durfee
versus
duke
that
you
clearly
saw
the
multiplicity
of
suits
that
could
arise
if
you
simply
allow
this
mississippi
jury
to
go
ahead
and
reach
it's
verdict.
here,
you
have
a
situation
where
a
question
of
ownership
was
tried
completely
through
the
state
of
nebraska,
all
of
its
courts.
then,
you
started
out
in
the
missouri
courts
and
it
was
removed
to
the
federal
district
court
in
missouri,
came
up
completely
through
the
court
system
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
at
which
time
you
pointed
out
only
last
week
that
had
anyone
come
up
here
and
asked
for
original-jurisdiction
if
the
battle
would
have
been
settled.
that
is
what
we
are
trying
to
avoid,
gentlemen.
there
is
no
way
to
settle
this
case
unless
we
are
here
on
a
matter
of
original-jurisdiction
and
that
is
--
that
is
why
we
are
here
now
in
order
to
cut
out
this
vexatious,
the
multiplicity
of
suits
that
are
possible.
i
believe
that
we
have
stated
the
cause
of
action
in
our
complaint.
now,
in
answer
to
our
staple
that
we
have
stated
the
cause
of
action,
mississippi
relies
on
two
cases.
one
is
esso
standard
oil
company
versus
jones
and
st.
clair
county
versus
lovingston.
i
have
the
honor
to
participate
in
the
esso
standard
versus
jones
case.
i
think
that
the
case
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
case
in
controversy
here
today.
in
esso
versus
(inaudible)
--
california
et
al.,
we
were
dealing
with
the
ownership
of
accretions
in
the
old
bend
way
after
a
cutoff
had
been
and
the
river
was
no
longer
effective
in
the
old
channel.
there,
we
had
no
question
whatsoever
of
thalweg
or
boundary.
it
was
a
question
of
whether
when
the
pond
of
mississippi
was
cutoff
whether
this
body
of
water
was
a
lake
or
whether
it
became
a
stream.
and
the
louisiana
supreme
court
held
that
as
long
as
this
body
of
water
had
(inaudible)
of
its
own,
which
it
did
at
the
time
that
the
suit
made
in
the
stream
regardless
of
whether
that
act
was
made
by
a
man
or
nature.
and
so,
the
second
question
in
the
suit
was
has
this
body
of
water
silted
up
and
became
land
instead
of
water,
who
owns
it?
and
the
court
held
that
the
riparian
owners
were
the
owners.
they
reached
that
decision
based
on
the
lovingston
case.
but
here,
we
have
an
entirely
different
situation.
we
have
an
avulsive
situation
in
the
new
channel.
in
the
old
channel,
your
changes
were
gradual
and
imperceptible.
now,
how
can
mississippi
contend
when
you
take
a
massive
drainage
and
start
excavating
land
that
that's
gradual
and
imperceptible?
it's
simply
beyond
lee.
yes,
justice
goldberg?
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
yes,
all
you
have
to
do
is
have
a
dispute
in
which
the
state
is
a
party
under
article
iii,
section
2
of
the
constitution.
we
are
part.
we
feel
that
we
are
a
party
to
this
controversy.
our
rights
have
been
jeopardized
not
might,
they're
having
it.
so,
regardless
with
mississippi's
position
in
this
matter,
we
feel
that
the
court
should
accept
the
original-jurisdiction
as
it's
granted
to
you
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
no,
sir,
i
said
original-jurisdiction.
there
is
a
distinction
in
boundary
between
two
states.
you
have
exclusive
and
original
in
the
case
that
you
mention
in
the
hypothetical,
it
is
original-jurisdiction.
now,
i
believe
that
we
have
discussed
efficiently
the
jones
case
and
pointed
out
that
that
case
is
good
law
but
it's
simply
inapplicable.
it
deals
with
accretion.
now,
there
are
a
myriad
of
cases
dealing
with
avulsion,
arkansas
versus
tennessee,
state
of
nebraska
versus
missouri,
and
others
too
numerous
to
mention.
all
of
these
cases
hold
that
when
--
where
running
streams
of
the
boundaries
between
states,
the
same
rule
applies
as
between
private
proprieties
and
that
is
that
if
the
stream
from
any
cause,
natural
or
artificial
suddenly
leaves
its
own
bed
and
forms
a
new
one
by
the
process
known
as
“avulsion”,
the
resulting
change
of
channel
works
no
change
of
boundary
which
remains
in
the
middle
of
the
old
channel.
now,
i
think
we've
demonstrated
in
our
complaint
in
up
here
today
that
we
have
stated
a
cause
of
action,
we
alleged
in
our
complaint
that
this
well
was
drilled
in
louisiana
and
remains
in
louisiana.
therefore,
we
have
a
controversy.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
yes,
sir,
yes,
sir,
that's
my
next
point.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
my
time
is
up.
i'll
have
to
handle
that
in
reputation
but
i
will
have
it,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
thank
you.
your
honors
may
i
answer
the
last
question
posed
to
me
before
beginning
my
refutation.
the
question
was
should
the
proceedings
in
the
united
states
district
court
be
stayed.
we
think
definitely,
yes.
i
do
not
agree
with
mississippi's
assertion
in
their
argument
in
their
brief
that
protest
should
be
something
like
the
case
of
louisiana
versus
mississippi
where
there
was
eminent
danger
on
conflict.
i
do
not
believe
that
we
have
to
convince
this
honorable
court
that
there's
a
possibility
of
a
war
between
louisiana
and
mississippi
for
this
court
to
have
jurisdiction
over
boundary
dispute.
that
is
possibly
the
maximum
situation.
but
we
believe
the
test
should
be
as
in
the
case
of
mississippi
versus
louisiana
in
1955
when
this
court
found
that
there
was
a
boundary
dispute.
the
one
in
question
asked
there
whether
it
was
substantial
or
whether
louisiana
wanted
to
exercise
jurisdiction
at
that
time,
the
question
was
simply
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
dispute
between
the
two
states
as
to
where
the
thalweg
was.
in
that
case,
we
were
dealing
with
accretions.
the
court
held
that
they
were
imperceptible
and
gradual
and
therefore
reached
a
different
conclusion
--
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
--
but
--
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
no,
sir.
what
i'm
saying
here,
the
only
question
before
this
court
is
there
a
dispute?
it
is
for
a
master
to
determine
what
kind
of
change
has
taken
place
and
whether
we
own
it
or
whether
a
--
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
--
recipient
--
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
i
think
we
would
still
--
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
no,
sir,
i
think
we
still
have
some
issues.
and
i
would
like
--
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
--
to
point
them
out.
we
drill
this
--
first,
let
me
say
that
i
do
not
like
the
idea
of
mississippi
putting
words
in
our
mouth
and
saying
that
we're
standing
on
the
proposition
that
the
thalweg
is,
in
1939,
is
as
it
should
be
established.
our
position
in
our
brief
was
that
if
this
is
an
avulsive
situation,
we
should
take
the
thalweg
as
it
existed
immediately
prior
to
the
avulsion.
now,
in
1932,
they
began
the
work
on
this
cutoff.
in
1939,
they
finished
it,
but
it
still
was
not
effective.
the
engineers
couldn't
get
water
to
go
through
it.
they
couldn't
divert
that
--
that
curb.
and
so,
they
went
back
in
and
bridged
it
again
and
it
was
not
until
1950
that
actually
the
cutoff
became
fully
effective.
so,
that
leads
us
to
this
issue.
if
the
thalweg
is
the
boundary,
what
is
the
critical
date
for
the
establishment
of
this
thalweg?
is
it
as
we
find
it
today?
is
it
as
we
find
it
at
the
time
the
zuccaros
filed
their
suit?
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
is
it
--
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
correct,
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
it
is
a
law.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
we
--
we
don't
say
that
it
was
accretion.
we
said
it
was
avulsion
which
is
the
opposite
--
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
i
--
i
think
that
mississippi
has
confused
us
here.
accretion
means
a
building
up
of
land
by
gradual
and
imperceptible
process.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
i
dont't
--
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
yes.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
i
don't
believe
that
there's
been
any
change
in
land
at
all.
there's
no
new
land
on
our
side
of
the
bank
and
no
new
land
on
the
mississippi
side
of
the
bank.
the
current
has
changed
to
where
the
main
current,
the
deepest
part
of
the
river
is
shifting
westward.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
no,
there's
still
water
there.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
there's
still
water
--
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
if
we're
speaking
of
it
--
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
sir?
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
if
we're
speaking
in
terms
of
the
thalweg,
yes,
sir.
if
we're
speaking
of
--
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
well,
the
lovingston
case,
as
they
pointed
out,
said
that
accretions
whether
man-made
or
natural,
if
imperceptible
will
set
the
thalweg
in
the
middle
of
the
main
channel.
now,
we
are
saying
that
this
is
an
avulsive
action,
first.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
and
second
that
it
was
perceptible
which
takes
us
out
of
the
--
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
right.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
right.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
that's
right.
and
further,
that
it
must
meet
the
test
of
the
imperceptibility
and
gradually
which
this
does
not
mean
a
dredge,
which
is
picking
up
more
than
a
ton
of
earth
in
a
time,
cannot
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
be
construed
as
gradual
and
imperceptible.
you
can
see
it.
this
court
held
in
the
very
case
that
were
cited
by
our
opponents,
st.
clair
versus
lovingston,
the
task
as
to
what
is
gradual
and
imperceptible
is
that,
although
the
witnesses
may
see
from
time
to
time
that
progress
has
been
made.
they
could
not
perceive
it
while
the
process
was
going
on.
it
is
imperceptible.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
in
other
words,
it's
what
can
be
seen.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
i
would
say
over
a
thousand
feet,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
and
it's
continuing
to
move
to
the
west.
now,
we
certainly
--
that
movement
has
been
a
myth.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
the
thalweg.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
no,
not
to
my
knowledge.
of
course,
that's
a
question
for
the
merits.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
yes,
your
honor,
why
is
it
here?
of
course,
it's
(inaudible)
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
yes,
it's
--
it's
over
a
mile,
i
would
say.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
our
courts
would
testify
before
our
master
from
12
to
15
miles
and
we
think
that
all
of
that
is
avulsive,
not
just
where
they
the
cut
and
that
is
the
opposite.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
sir?
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
no
(inaudible)
another
bend
and
that
it
gets
back
into
its
natural
current.
now,
we
think
that
this
boundary
dispute
--
dispute
exist
and
that
the
controversy
between
the
parties
is
real
and
substantial.
we
do
not
think
that
we
should
be
forced
to
submit
ourselves
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
mississippi
jury
to
determine
our
eastern
boundary.
we
do
not
think
that
even
if
we
did
submit
ourselves
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
mississippi
case
that
we
would
solve
anything
because
mississippi
is
not
a
party
and
it
would
not
be
bound
by
that
decision.
and
until
you
have
both
states
bound,
you
cannot
determine
this
boundary.
now,
the
issue
was
brought
home
very
clearly
by
mr.
justice
black's
questions
to
my
opponent.
he
said,
“is
this
well
located
in
the
state
of
mississippi
or
in
louisiana?”
and
they
said
it
was
located
in
mississippi.
we
contend
in
our
complaint
that
it's
located
in
louisiana
and
has
always
been
located
in
louisiana.
and
furthermore,
if
it
isn't,
that
the
change
is
made
in
the
thalweg
have
no
effect
on
our
eastern
boundary.
that's
the
first
issue.
then
the
second
is
whether
this
thing
is
caused
by
avulsion
or
pure
accretion?
is
it
a
gradual
and
imperceptible
thing?
or
is
it
something
that
you
can
see
or
the
change
is
personable?
or
is
it
done
in
such
a
manner
that
this
artificial
change
resulted
in
no
change
in
boundary?
now,
i
--
i
think
that
it's
quite
an
important
point,
if
this
thing
is
avulsive,
we
have
the
additional
issue,
which
i
was
beginning
to
get
into,
of
when
is
the
critical
date?
if
it
was
avulsive,
is
it
when
the
channel
is
completed?
or
is
it
when
it
becomes
completely
effective?
or
is
it
when
we
have
drilled
our
oil
well?
all
of
these
are
important
questions
and
we'll
come
up.
they
will
determine
the
good
or
the
bad
faith
of
the
oil
company
in
drilling
this
well.
should
they
have
known
or
not
know
whether
to
drill
this
well?
we
--
we
think
that
all
these
questions
will
have
to
be
decided.
we
think
that
counsel
for
the
opposition
is
talking
either
both
sides
of
his
mouth.
first
in
his
brief,
he
says,
“all
you've
got
to
do
is
find
the
present
thalweg.
you
don't
have
to
take
jurisdiction
over
this
matter.
(inaudible)
and
you'll
find.
on
other
hand,
he
is
saying,
“if
you
take
jurisdiction
over
this
case,
you're
going
to
be
faced
with
a
multiplicity
of
suits,
it's
so
complex,
it's
going
to
be
too
troublesome
for
this
court.”
now,
i
think
that
that's
an
inconsistent
argument
that
is
made
by
our
opponent.
we
do
not
think
that
it
would
be
too
difficult
for
this
court
or
any
other
court
to
decide.
we
simply
feel
that
the
united
states
constitution
has
set
up
this
court
as
the
original
forum
for
such
a
dispute.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
we
were
trying
to
do
that
in
one
other
thing.
we
were
trying
to
plead
alternatively
that
first,
this
is
an
avulsion
and
it
done
map
because
the
boundary
was
set.
second,
if
it
was
not
an
avulsion
that
these
accretions
were
not
gradual
and
imperceptible
and
therefore,
they
would
not
--
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
yes,
sir
--
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
that's
right.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
that's
right.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
now
--
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
in
other
words,
the
question
that
your
honor
asked
to
my
opponent,
“show
me
a
case
where
an
avulsion
--
that
--
that
after
an
avulsion
that
the
title
was
determined
by
the
live
thalweg.”
i
have
been
unable
to
find
any
case
that
this
court
has
ever
decided
to
that
effect.
the
cases
that
my
opponents
have
pointed
out
dealt
with
pure
accretion.
they
did
not
deal
with
avulsive
situation.
and
we
think
the
fact
that
this
is
immediately
below
a
cutoff
makes
it
nonetheless,
avulsive.
so
therefore,
i
believe
that
we
have
shown
all
of
their
arguments
that
there
is
a
justiciable
controversy,
that
we
have
stated
the
cause
of
action.
there
is
a
real
dispute
between
the
state
of
louisiana
and
mississippi.
in
closing,
i
would
like
to
counteract
one
thing
my
opponent
has
said
and
that
is
if
they
had
no
knowledge
of
this
complaint
until
they
saw
it,
i
think
we
can
aptly
show
before
our
master
that
we
wrote
the
attorney
general
of
mississippi
and
the
governor
of
mississippi
stating
that
we
were
going
to
the
seek
the
original-jurisdiction
of
this
court
more
than
two
months
prior
to
its
filing.
they
were
aware
of
this
dispute.
i'd
like
to
finish
by
talking
about
this
agreement
between
humble
and
carter
and
the
zuccaros,
which
i
thought
has
made
so
much
of
the
seeking
agreement.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
state
of
louisiana's
right
can
be
modified
in
any
respect
by
either
carter,
by
humble
or
by
the
zuccaros
nor
can
the
rights
of
the
state
of
mississippi
is
purely
immaterial
to
the
matter
at
hand.
the
question
is,
is
there
a
dispute?
is
it
a
real
dispute?
we
say
it
is
real
and
immediate.
i
certainly
want
to
thank
the
court
for
your
kind
attention.
it's
been
a
real
privilege.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
thank
you
sir.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
special
master
found
as
mr.
madden
pointed
out
in
his
open
statement
that
the
vested
rights
of
the
state
of
louisiana
are
directly
involved
in
this
case.
in
addition,
some
of
the
property
rights
of
its
mineral
lessee
humble
oil
refining
company
also
all
the
rights
of
certain
mississippi
citizens
as
well
as
the
state
of
mississippi.
the
special
match
--
master
advised
this
court
that
you
should
take
jurisdiction
over
the
boundary
question
which
should
leave
these
ancillary
issues
to
some
other
tribunal.
needless
to
say
the
problems
of
taxation
of
the
validity
of
leases
of
the
administrative
powers
exercised
by
the
state
over
the
production
and
sale
of
petroleum
products
make
all
of
these
factors
inextricably
bound
in
with
the
boundary
question.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
louisiana
does
not
wish
to
submit
itself
to
any
other
tribunal
insofar
as
these
ancillary
matters
are
concerned.
we
think
that
this
is
the
only
court
that
has
jurisdiction
over
all
of
the
courts.
now,
i
am
authorized
to
say
on
behalf
of
humble
and
we
in
louisiana
recognize
that
humble
may
have
certain
additional
defenses
to
the
state
of
louisiana
as
well
because
they
have
leased
this
from
citizens
from
louisiana
as
well
as
the
state
of
louisiana.
nevertheless,
humble
joins
with
the
state
of
louisiana
in
its
principle
argument
on
the
boundary
question.
now,
there
really
three
general
rules
of
law
which
are
involved
in
this
case.
the
first
rule
is
that
when
a
navigable
river
such
as
the
mississippi
forms
the
boundary
between
two
states
that
the
thalweg
or
middle
of
the
main
channel
is
the
boundary.
second,
the
master
stated
with
accuracy
on
page
14,
when
by
a
natural,
gradual
and
more
or
less
imperceptible
processes
of
erosion
and
accretion,
the
thalweg
changes,
the
boundary
follows
the
stream
and
remains
along
the
varying
center
of
the
channel,
citing
new
orleans
versus
united
states.
equally
well
established
in
our
law
is
the
proposition
of
avulsion.
when
an
avulsion
occurs,
the
center
of
the
old
channel
remains
the
boundary,
county
of
st.
clair
versus
lovingston.
now
in
the
context
of
these
general
rules
of
law
and
the
facts
in
the
record,
the
position
of
the
state
of
louisiana
may
be
stated
as
follows.
first,
the
changes
which
took
place
here
are
avulsive
in
nature,
are
avulsive
in
effect
and
therefore
in
and
of
themselves
are
sufficient
to
cause
the
boundary
to
be
fixed
permanently
as
it
was
prior
to
the
work
of
the
u.s.
engineers.
second,
the
changes
here
were
wholly
caused,
all
witnesses
testified
this.
were
wholly
caused
by
artificial
means,
the
artificial
means
here
used
were
so
extensive
and
the
changes
resulting
there
from
were
so
drastic
that
this
court
is
required
to
rule
that
the
boundary
has
been
fixed
permanently.
now,
we
will
show
that
the
changes
are
avulsive
in
effect.
there're
various
definitions
of
avulsion
and
no
one
definition
is
consistently
used
by
this
court.
perhaps
the
best
definition
is
contained
in
56
american
jurisprudence
section
477.
avulsion
is
a
sudden
and
perceptible
loss
or
addition
to
land
by
the
action
of
water
or
a
sudden
change
in
the
bed
or
course
of
a
stream.
all
of
the
cases
show
that
there
are
actually
to
types
of
avulsion.
one
type
is
where
there
is
a
sudden
and
perha
--
perceptible
gain
or
loss
of
land
on
the
banks.
the
opposite
of
this
type
of
avulsion
is
the
gradual
and
imperceptible
process
of
accretion
and
erosion.
it
is
in
that
kind
of
avulsion
which
deals
only
with
banks
that
the
element
of
time
and
perceptibility
become
important.
the
other
type
of
avulsion
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
banks
of
streams.
this
is
avulsion
in
which
there
is
a
sudden
change
in
the
bed
or
course
of
a
stream.
this
type
of
avulsion
is
not
the
opposite
of
accretion.
we
do
not
have
here
a
change
in
the
bed
of
the
river
in
the
case
at
bar.
but
what
we
do
have
is
a
definite
and
drastic
change
in
the
course
of
the
river.
in
this
case,
we
found
that
dead
mans
bend
which
had
previously
flowed
hard
towards
the
mississippi
bank
has
been
wrenched
by
the
u.s.
engineers
and
now
flows
hard
against
louisiana's
side.
this
is
a
complete
reversal
of
the
forces
of
nature.
we
are
here
concerned
in
this
case,
not
with
what
has
happened
to
the
banks,
has
there
been
a
build-up
with
the
accretion.
we
are
concerned
here
with
the
location
of
a
thalweg
which
follows
the
main
channel
of
navigation.
this
is
a
line
in
the
water
and
here,
time
and
perceptibility
are
not
necessary
in
order
to
contrast
what
occurred
here
with
some
other
rule
of
law.
in
many
cases
where
the
distinction
was
unimportant,
it
has
even
been
stated
that
our
second
type
of
avulsion
had
to
be
perceptible.
the
cases
indicate
that
the
factor
of
imperceptibility
has
never
stood
in
this
court's
way
in
determining
an
avulsion.
if
there
was
a
drastic
change
in
the
bed
or
course
of
the
stream,
we
know
of
no
case
where
there
was
a
drastic
change
in
the
thalweg
in
which
this
court
has
ever
held
that
the
change
was
not
rapid
enough
to
be
avulsive.
the
cases
we
have
examined
of
this
court
show
that
periods
as
short
as
one
year
or
as
long
as
10
years
had
been
sufficient
to
be
held
avulsive.
in
our
own
case,
the
engineers
took
eight
years
before
the
glasscock
cutoff
was
even
the
principal
channel
of
navigation.
it
was
19
years
before
the
avulsive
works
were
completed
in
the
cutoff.
only
in
1952
was
the
high
water
flow
all
through
the
cutoff,
yet
no
one
questions
here
even
our
friends
from
mississippi,
that
what
happened
in
this
court
was
avulsive.
on
the
facts
that
we
have
here,
there
should
be
no
doubt
that
the
changes
which
occurred
were
sufficiently
rapid
viewed
with
respect
to
nick
of
time
lapsing
in
past
cases.
the
change
of
course
took
place
in
the
problem
area
quite
dramatically
after
1951.
now
mississippi's
own
contention
was,
which
they
vigorously
urge
show
that
the
oil
well
which
is
set
fully
located
in
the
problem
area
that
the
thalweg
changed
1500
feet
in
less
than
18
months
whereas,
it
had
changed
only
a
thousand
feet
from
its
1933
location
in
18
years.
mississippi
in
its
argument
would
penalize
us
because
the
engineers
to
--
who
undertook
what
at
that
time
was
a
gigantic
task
and
failed
to
maintain
channel
line.
they
would
also
penalize
us
because
the
engineers
took
a
long
time
to
accomplish
their
work.
we
should
not
be
so
doubly
penalized.
we
therefore
may
conclude
that
the
changes
here
correspond
to
the
basic
concept
of
avulsion
and
to
the
fundamental
reasoning
inherent
therein
accordingly
the
same
legal
consequences
falling
from
avulsion
should
be
applied
to
this
case.
now
beyond
the
concept
of
avulsion,
let
us
now
consider
violent
changes
which
are
caused
wholly
by
the
works
of
man.
can
the
works
of
man
which
completely
reverse
the
processes
of
nature
as
on
the
facts
of
this
case
change
the
boundaries
of
states?
absolutely
not.
of
course
there
was
a
time
not
too
many
years
ago
when
the
power
of
man
to
so
drastically
affect
boundaries
simply
did
not
exist.
there
had
been
a
number
of
instances
in
the
past
when
water
has
been
diverted
or
the
flow
of
some
--
to
some
extent
change.generally
however
until
the
past
generation
or
so,
the
power
to
do
this
to
any
great
extent
was
extremely
limited.
certain
is
the
case
which
rivers
is
powerful
in
the
mississippi.
in
this
day
and
age
with
increased
sources
of
energy
available
and
the
increase
in
technical
knowledge,
the
power
of
man
has
become
almost
unlimited.
today,
we
find
our
scientist
and
our
government
leaders
discussing
in
all
seriousness
the
feasibility
of
a
canal
across
the
northern
part
of
florida,
the
advisability
of
blasting
a
path
for
the
rio
grande
all
the
way
to
the
pacific
ocean,
a
construction
of
dams
that
defy
the
imagination.
there
is
pending
in
congress
today,
a
bill
to
study
a
30-year
project
calling
for
the
complete
realignment
of
all
the
northwestern
sources
of
water
and
the
utilization
of
presently
existing
rivers
to
carry
tremendous,
almost
unheard
of
volumes
of
water
to
the
entire
western
path
of
this
country.
of
course,
this
works
are
not
undertaken
lightly,
it
is
generally
agreed
that
they
are
for
the
ultimate
benefit
of
the
people
of
our
country.
but
it
should
not
be
necessary
to
weigh
this
benefit
against
the
laws
that
it
will
do
to
a
state
if
its
boundaries
have
been
changed
as
a
result
of
this
work
of
man.
it
is
not
our
purpose
here
to
say
that
this
work
should
be
discontinued.
it
is
only
to
suggest
that
the
rule
of
law
which
we
espouse
today
that
the
damaging
effect
of
these
works
be
minimized,
so
that
the
benefit
of
these
works
may
be
fully
realized
without
impediment
and
without
the
necessity
of
any
sort
of
compensation
or
payments
to
those
who
unfairly
lose
on
an
individual
basis
in
order
to
satisfy
public
necessity.
we
know
that
our
boundary
--
if
we
know
that
our
boundaries
cannot
be
changed,
we
remove
a
major
objection
to
otherwise
a
worthy
project.
the
rule
that
we
espouse
is
not
a
new
rule
of
law
your
honors.
in
state
versus
bowen,
supreme
court
of
wisconsin,
135
northwest
494.
their
railroad
company
constructed
a
dam
across
the
east
channel
of
the
mississippi
river
to
the
west
of
minnesota
island.
the
boundary
had
formally
been
through
this
channel.
this
directed
the
current
around
the
other
side
of
the
island.
the
court
held
that
this
constituted
an
avulsion
saying,
“it
is
obvious
that
any
change
brought
in
the
flow
of
water
by
means
of
a
dam
cannot
affect
the
question
of
state
boundary
anymore
than
cuts
can
such
change
produced
by
an
avulsion.”
but
neither
can
have
the
boundaries
of
his
domain
changed
by
avulsion
or
by
the
diversion
of
water
affected
by
human
agencies.
in
u.s.
gypsum
versus
(inaudible),
united
states
district
court
police
and
district
of
arkansas
in
1964,
the
court
held,
"i
am
convinced,
incidentally
this
was
after
ten
years
of
dredging
by
the
u.s.
engineers
to
accomplish
the
purpose."
the
court
held,
"i
am
convinced
that
insofar
as
the
time
element
is
concern,
that
the
shift
of
the
mississippi
river
from
the
dam
way
to
the
point
way
meets
the
necessary
requirement
of
an
avulsion."
in
whiteside
versus
norton,
which
is
an
eighth
circuit
court
case
of
1913,
the
court
held
that
the
main
channel
of
the
st.
louis
river
was
located
north
of
tallas
island
and
at
this
point
fall
a
boundary
line
between
minnesota
and
wisconsin.
the
u.s.
engineers
dredged
the
channel
south
of
tallas
island,
the
work
took
from
1899
to
1902
or
three
years.
the
court
held
that
title
cannot
be
divested
by
artificial
and
arbitrary
process.
the
case
further
held
that
congress
without
consent
has
no
power
to
change
the
boundary
between
states
still
last
less
does
an
administrative
department,
meaning
the
united
states
engineers.
we
--
the
court
held,
“we
cannot
agree
that
human
agencies
can
suddenly
bring
about
what
like
acts
of
nature
admittedly
cannot
accomplish.”
cutting
this
channel
was
analogous
to
avulsion.
it
could
not
operate
to
change
the
boundary
between
the
state
of
wisconsin
and
minnesota.
that
case
was
appealed
to
the
united
states
supreme
court.
an
appeal
was
refused
on
other
grounds,
but
this
court
through
chief
justice
white
said,
“we
are
clearly
of
the
opinion
that
the
mere
fact
that
congress
in
the
exercise
of
its
power
to
improve
navigation,
directed
the
construction
of
the
new
channel
affords
no
basis
whatsoever
for
the
assumption
that
thereby
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
rights
of
property
if
secured
by
state
law
were
destroyed
and
new
rights,
a
property
on
the
assumption
indulged
in
incompatible
with
that
law
were
bestowed
by
congress.”
now
in
louisiana
versus
mississippi,

u.s.
5,
this
court
adopted
the
master's
finding.
there,
the
master
held,
the
construction
of
dam
and
cutoff
being
an
artificial
avulsion
did
not
alter
or
change
the
boundary
between
the
two
states.
before
development
of
that
dam
and
point
cutoff
required
eight
years
and
this
court
adopted
the
master's
report
as
its
own.
thank
you
gentlemen.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
thank
you
your
honor.
your
honor,
perhaps
it
would
be
best
for
me
at
this
time
to
briefly
state
our
position.
louisiana
is
not
here
today
asking
this
court
to
set
a
permanent
boundary
in
every
instance
where
the
work
of
man
has
had
something
to
do
with
it.
we
are
not
asking
this
court,
for
example
that
the
government
constructs
a
jetty
and
the
forces
of
man
and
nature
combined
to
accelerate
accretion
or
erosion.
we
do
--
we're
not
asking
for
a
change
in
that
route.
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
abandon
the
principle
of
law
annunciated
in
st.
clair
versus
lovingston
and
the
land
of
white
cases
cited
by
our
opponents.
we
believe
that
they
are
real
and
solid
distinctions
between
those
cases
and
the
case
at
bar.
we
are
saying
first
the
law
of
accretion
and
erosion
is
perfectly
good
law
unless
you
have
an
avulsion.
and
then
accretion
is
not
preferred
by
the
law,
if
it
is
avulsion
that
is
just
as
an
honorable
a
principle
of
law
as
the
principle
of
accretion
and
erosion.
they
are
different
and
they
occur
in
different
situations.
so
we
are
saying
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
restrict
the
facts
of
st.
clair
versus
lovingston
to
it's
own
facts
and
apply
the
facts
of
this
case
which
makes
this
an
avulsion
or
analogous
to
an
avulsion
as
has
been
done
by
this
court
in
the
past.
now,
st.
clair
versus
lovingston
is
good
law
if
you're
trying
to
figure
out
what
happened
in
the
old
bend
way.
and
i
agree
with
my
learned
opponent
when
he
said,
what
happened
in
the
live
river
is
something
different
with
what
happened
up
here.
st.
clair
versus
lovingston
would
give
to
the
riparian
owners
in
this
area
the
accreted
lands,
the
built-up
lands
as
long
as
there
is
a
thread
or
current
going
through
the
whole
bend
way,
that's
not
the
situation
in
this
case.
if
we
had
built
an
effective
dam
here
and
we
have
built
an
effective
dam
here,
there
would
be
no
accretion
or
erosion
in
the
whole
bend
way.
it
just
simply
couldn't
happen
because
it
is
the
flow
that
causes
the
accretion.
now,
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
a
line
in
the
middle
of
the
water,
it
is
an
imperceptible
line,
we
couldn't
see
where
this
thalweg
was
in
the
first
place.
we
don't
know
where
it
is
today,
we
don't
know
where
it
was
in
1932
unless
you
could
somehow
get
below
that
water
and
find
out
where
that
deepest
trench,
where
that
valley,
where
that
main
channel
of
navigation
was.
by
its
very
nature,
it
is
not
perceptible.
nor
are
we
dealing
here
to
a
build-up
of
land
on
the
mississippi
side
and
an
erosion
on
the
louisiana
side.
we're
attempting
to
locate
a
line
in
the
water.
so
we
say
that
there
are
two
major
distinctions
as
between
the
cases
cited
by
our
folks,
st.clair
versus
lovingston
and
the
cases
that
follow
it
and
this
case.
first,
st.
clair
versus
lovingston
and
its
follow-up
cases
were
not
dealing
with
boundary.
we
are
dealing
with
boundaries
here.
second,
st.
clair
versus
lovingston
and
these
other
cases
were
dealing
with
accretion
to
the
bank.
that
is
a
build-up
of
land
on
one
side
of
the
river.
we
are
not
dealing
with
that
here.
needless
to
say
every
point
i
made
in
my
opening
argument
was
a
distinction
between
st.
clair
versus
lovingston
in
this
set
of
facts.
that
is,
that
the
works
of
man
intervene
in
such
a
drastic
way
as
to
completely
reverse
the
forces
of
nature.
now
let's
look
at
the
equities.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
yes
sir.
that's
very
easy.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
that
is
what
we
have
determined
as
point
x.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
this
has
been
found
by
the
master.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
that
--
the
special
master
found
that
the
results
were
measurable
to
point
x.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
now,
we
are
saying
that
from
b
to
x
is
a
completely
measurable
situation.
and
between
these
points,
a
fixed
boundary
should
be
in
place
and
this
will
not
open
pandora's
box,
this
should
not
give
the
court
any
trouble.
now
let's
talk
about
(inaudible)
which
is
from
x
to
z.
sure
we
contend
it
in
our
brief
that
changes
occurred
there
but
we
take
the
position
that
from
x
to
z
the
changes
are
immeasurable.
we
can't
tell
how
much
was
done
by
nature
and
how
much
was
done
by
man.
so
we
are
not
asking
that
--
from
the
thalweg
be
fixed
in
that
area.
we
are
asking
the
court
to
apply
the
rule
only
to
the
measurable
portion
of
this
river
and
that
is
the
foot
of
the
cutoff
to
the
foot
of
dead
mans
bend.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
in
here
your
honor,
between
x
and
z.
do
you
remember
mr.
madden
was
talking
about,
you
got
accretion
on
the
current
banks,
you
get
--
on
the
concave
portion,
you
have
the
erosion,
they're
eating
the
way.
now,
i
believe
that
what
i
have
to
say
about
progress
may
help
us
in
this
particular
question.
on
page
11
of
our
brief,
the
question
was
asked
about
a
particular
diagram
there.
what
we
are
saying
on
page
11
is
that
if
left
to
its
own
devices,
the
river
will
compensate
for
itself.
if
the
forces
of
nature
are
left
alone,
the
heavy
portions
of
this
land
will
be
the
river.
and
if
that
happens,
the
live
thalweg
should
be
the
boundary.
but
what
happened
here
was
that
because
wholly
and
solely,
due
to
the
work
of
the
united
states
engineer,
the
current
was
diverted
at
right
angles
and
now
heads
into
louisiana
where
it
once
headed
into
mississippi.
now
let's
see
the
effect
of
it.
when
the
engineers
made
the
glasscock
cutoff,
we
didn't
gain
the
area
to
the
west
of
the
live
thalweg
in
the
cutoff,
all
the
engineers
took
there
was
an
easement.
so
louisiana
holds
nothing
in
the
live
river
from
y
to
b.
as
a
result
of
this
cut
and
the
thalweg
being
placed
over
here,
louisiana
owns
nothing
of
dead
mans
bend,
and
that
remains
the
property
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
as
a
result
of
the
cut,
every
survey
since
1765
shows
that
the
current
had
been
beating
against
mississippi
in
this
point
at
the
rate
of
some
70
feet
a
year.
so
let's
talk
about
that
one.
if
nature
had
been
left
alone,
we
would
not
be
facing
the
lew
carrols
(ph)
in
this
case
because
they
not
only
would
own
the
furniture,
they
wouldn't
own
any
land
at
all
because
in
the
33
years,
this
is
the
last,
between
the
building
of
this
cut,
if
that
river
had
continued
going
70
feet
a
year
against
mississippi,
they
wouldn't
be
anywhere
around.
so
we're
saying
that
what
we're
asking
for
is
complete
equity.
and
it
is
not
equity
to
say
that
a
hoop
hair
bend
louisiana
will
begin
again
to
see
some
accretion.
we
have
lost
our
accretion
here
and
we've
lost
our
accretion
in
the
bend
below
it,
as
a
result
of
this
cutoff.
so
you
have
reversed
the
forces
of
nature
and
louisiana
loses
in
two
bends
in
a
row
instead
of
every
other
bend.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
1932
was
the
beginning
of
the
dredging
your
honor
in
the
glasscock
cutoff.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
this
work
went
on
for
some
eight
or
nine
years.
the
dredging
itself,
as
i
pointed
out
from
my
principal
argument.during
that
time,
you
have
some
water
going
through
the
cut
and
you
have
some
water
going
through
the
bend
way.
it
was
not
until
1941
that
more
of
the
water
began
to
pass
through
the
cut
than
pass
through
the
bend
way.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
but
we
must
remember
that
while
that
was
going
on,
you
had
two
conflicting
forces.
here,
you
had
water
heading
towards
mississippi
and
water
heading
towards
louisiana.
so
its
effect
is
almost
neutralized
during
the
period
of
the
work.
the
rule
of
law,
which
we
filed,
is
that
this
boundary
should
be
permanently
fixed
as
it
was
immediately
prior
to
the
avulsive
act
or
the
work
of
man.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
yes,
sir
--
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
no,
sir.
louisiana
--
if
you
took
part
of
going
to
louisiana
would
win
and
so
with
others.
it's
only
when
you
get
--
in
fact
the
special
master
plan
that
the
thalweg
actually
crossed
the
well
location
after
1954.
that
this
well
was
drilled
in
louisiana,
it
was
completed
in
louisiana,
and
it
was
produced
in
louisiana.
then
he
picks
a
date
somewhere
subsequent
to
that
well
being
drilled
and
says
the
thalweg
move
passed
it.
now
that
brings
us
to
the
rationale
of
the
case.
if
this
court
holds
that
this
is
a
permanent
remedy
as
existed
prior
to
works
of
man,
which
could
be
any
time
prior
to
1954,
then
you
have
no
ancillary
issues
in
this
case.
there's
not
one
single
of
the
issue
but
if
you
hold
that
--
as
the
special
master
did,
that
this
well
was
drilled
in
louisiana
and
produced
in
louisiana
but
that
at
some
later
date
because
of
this
shift
its
now
in
mississippi,
you
can
see
the
manifold
problems
that
will
be
created
to
the
state
and
these
are
not
private
problems
between
the
litigants,
we're
collecting
severance
taxes
right
now
on
that
well.
we're
collecting
(inaudible)
on
that
well.
what
was
the
point
at
which
those
rafters
should
have
shifted
over
to
somebody
else?
what
was
the
point
where
we
had
to
quit
collecting
our
taxes?
remember
gentlemen
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
sir?
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
alright,
your
honor,
today,
there
was
one
other
governmental
point
--
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
but
sir,
we
--
there
was
not
(voice
overlap)
--
not
admit
that.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
no,
sir.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
all
we
have
stipulated
in
this
case
now
is
that
in
1964,
that
that
thalweg
then
was
west
of
the
well
location.
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
the
special
master
found
that
it
moved
over
pass
the
well
some
time
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
m.
carmouche
as
i
pointed
out,
our
taxing
power
your
honor,
a
right
to
settle
out.
it
was
everyday
louisiana
tells
this
company
how
many
barrels
of
oil
they
can
produce
from
this
well.
now,
another
point
i
would
like
to
get
straight
and
this
is
really
a
problem
in
the
case.
we
are
not
here
fighting
over
an
oil
well.
its
true
there
is
one
oil
well
located
in
the
problem
area,
but
we
want
this
court
to
realize
that
if
you
set
a
live
thalweg,
louisiana
will
lose
an
entire
oil
field,
that
there
are
some
26
producing
wells
in
this
immediate
area.
the
special
master
and
all
the
witnesses
found
that
the
cost
of
this
cut,
it's
now
eating
at
--
into
louisiana
more
that
70
feet
away.
those
surface
locations
will
begin
dropping
out.
we
will
then
have
the
problem
--
are
those
wells
owned
by
mississippians?
are
they
owned
by
citizens
of
louisiana?
everyday
is
going
to
make
the
change.
not
on
this
well,
but
on
other
wells
in
the
fields
located
within
50,
60,
and
a
hundred
feet
of
the
river
bank,
and
all
of
those
appear
in
the
records
your
honor.
now,
to
finally
summarize
and
close,
apparently,
the
master
was
bothered
about
three
things
in
concluding
that
this
was
not
an
avulsion.
first,
was
the
element
of
time.
the
element
of
time
in
this
case
is
no
longer
than
the
time
element
in
which
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
st.
louis
versus
rotz
said
that
an
avulsion
took
place.
so
we
can
eliminate
his
worry
about
time
whether
this
was
rugged.
i
may
also
add
that
in
terms
of
geologic
term,
in
terms
of
the
power
of
man
to
accomplish
great
jobs
that
what
occurred
here
took
only
an
instant.
second,
the
special
master
was
worried
about
the
perceptibility,
yet
where
was
the
perceptibility
in
st.
louis
versus
rotz
where
you
had
an
island
that
just
shifted
a
mile
and
a
half
down
the
river?
that
was
not
--
no
more
perceptible
then
what
went
on
here.
third,
the
master
and
mississippi
seem
to
think
that
you
had
to
have
an
actual
change
in
the
bed
in
order
to
have
an
avulsion.
this
court
has
already
held
time
and
time
again
that
you
can
have
an
avulsion
where
you
just
have
a
piece
of
land
that's
slides
off
of
my
land
and
clops
up
against
somebody
else's
land.
there's
no
change
in
the
bend
there.
this
court
has
held
time
and
time
again
that
an
avulsion
can
occur
where
you
have
a
change
in
course
or
a
change
in
the
channel.
we
deal
with
the
same
thing.
that
we
submit
gentlemen
is
what
happened
here.
i
would
like
to
close
on
a
note
of
liberty,
i
never
thought
that
i
would
live
to
appear
before
the
united
states
supreme
court
arguing
on
one
hand
for
the
sovereignty
of
a
state's
boundary
and
to
maintain
the
state's
integrity
and
have
the
state
of
mississippi
on
the
other
side
saying,
“don't
worry
about
federal
interventions.”
thank
you.
