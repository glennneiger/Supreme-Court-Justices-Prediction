justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
area
is
affected
by
the
same
consideration
that
the
specific
well
occasion
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
thalweg
is
frankly
a
new
word
to
me,
that's
the
midpoint
of
the
main
channel?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mississippi
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mississippi
hasn't,
for
a
minute,
suggested
that
this
well
or
any
of
this
land
is
in
fact
in
the
state
of
louisiana,
has
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
does
the
state
of
mississippi
doesn't
concede
that
it's
in
louisiana?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
--
you've
asserted
--
louisiana
has
asserted
its
title
to
this
land
and
mississippi
neither
--
neither
admits
nor
denies
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
an
ordinary
pleading,
i
suppose,
that
would
be
a
denial
in
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
stream
(inaudible)
in
the
--
in
the
location
of
the
river
down
below
the
cutoff
is
because
of
the
--
the
water
running
in
a
different
angle
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
that
--
what
that
case
holds?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
understand
that
mississippi
or
louisiana,
in
making
this
assertion,
that
the
location
of
the
--
of
the
boundary
line
or
the
location
of
the
thalweg
below
the
cutoff
has
been
radically
changed
as
the
result
of
the
cutoff?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
in
the
assertion?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
boundary
would
change
or
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
thalweg
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
changed
as
the
result
of
the
cutoff
but
that
couldn't
change
the
boundary.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
are
saying
that
the
thalweg
has
changed
because
of
the
cutoff.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
a
--
and
that
a
--
a
changing
thal
--
a
thalweg,
it
changes
because
of
a
man-made
cutoff
that
changed
the
boundary.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
suggest
that
the
thalweg
in
the
same
place
today
as
it
was
in
1939.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
to
this
thing
it
isn't
very
important
than
it
is
very
often
important
to
determine
where
the
thalweg
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
just
saying
that
we
shouldn't
take
the
case
because
it's
so
difficult
to
--
you
have
to
take
another
one
tomorrow
and
the
next
day.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
louisiana
says
that
--
that
the
state
--
the
ordinary
rule
of
the
thalweg
shouldn't
apply
here
because
the
--
because
the
year
of
the
area
of
all
the
cutoff
really
was
a
part
of
a
man-made
avulsion.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
let's
--
let's
assume
for
the
moment
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
in
1939
and
whenever
does
the
cutoff
was
constructed
that
--within
--
and
it
was
put
in
the
operation,
it
was
in
a
month
the
channel
of
the
river
has
shifted
to
the
west
in
that
12
miles,
500
yards
just
from
the
--
just
from
the
stream
having
a
different
speed
and
a
different
direction
of
the
flow
that
--
at
that
point,
say
it
had
changed
immediately
and
--
and
obviously
500
yards.
now,
the
--
the
rule
would
be
that
--
that
an
avulsion
doesn't
change
the
boundary,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
streams
would
still
be
400
--
and
that
it'd
be
400
and
500
yards
away.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
in
the
state
where
it
is,
there
would
be
a
--
a
change
in
thalweg
just
a
little
bit
now
and
then
but
now
it's
changed
500
yards.
the
river
is
flowing
--
flowing
in
a
--
in
a
different
place.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
you
never
will
otherwise.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
the
years?
do
you
know
whenever
those?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
in
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
might
be
different
tomorrow.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
somebody
drills
an
oil
well
in
the
middle
of
--
of
mississippi
river
that
--
today
it
might
be
in
louisiana,
the
next
day
in
mississippi,
the
next
day
after
that
it
might
be
shipped
back
and
it
might
be
--
it
might
just
change
back
and
forth
every
week.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
--
that
would
bind
neither
the
--
that
would
bind
neither
the
land
in
private
land
over
in
mississippi
side
or
either
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
that
effect
said
that
this
land
below
is
within
the
avulsion.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
there
is
a
--
the
assertion
is
that
there
was
--
there
--
as
i
understand
it,
at
least
that
within
their
assertion
--
their
assertion
includes
the
proposition
or
the
possibility
that
there
was
a
radical
change
below
the
cut
which
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
man-made
avulsion.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
main
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
there
was
a
radical
change,
he
wouldn't
be
making
his
argument,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

minimum
that
it's
a
question
of
law,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
maybe
that
you
have
to
have
--
if
the
--
if
the
questions
were
decided
in
certain
ways,
maybe
you'll
have
to
have
a
fact.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
--
do
you
say
that
conceding
--
conceding
that
the
river
shifted
due
to
the
man-made
avulsion
nevertheless
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
would
say
that
we
get
the
same
result,
the
same
question
as
supposed
that
a
man
didn't
make
this
avulsion
but
it
is
occurred
naturally.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
there
been
any
suggestion
that
mississippi
and
louisiana
has
any
kind
of
conversation
about
a
settlement
of
this
case
or
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
--
and
you
say
that
as
long
as
it's
accretive
below
the
cutoff,
it
cannot
--
that
--
that
the
thalweg
still
marked
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
boundary.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
long
as
it's
accretive,
no
matter
as
if
this
result
from
the
cutoff.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
don't
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
--
would
you
agree
here
that
you
have
that
case
as
to
the
court
held
that
any
accretive
change
is
--
is
--
does
change
the
boundary?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
--
that
is
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--point.
let's
assume
that
it
was
determined
that
there
was
an
accretive
change
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
any
accretive
change
whether
caused
by
avulsion
or
not
changes
the
boundary.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
matter
before
us.
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
is
--
is
that
acceptable
as
cutoff,
you
would
say
from
day
to
day
is
the
right
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
now
you
say,
the
--
that
the
--
that
the
cutoff
makes
all
the
difference
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
even
though
there's
only
accretive
change
involved.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

you
say
it's
accretion
as
a
result
of
an
avulsion
which
makes
it
an
avulsion
in
your
--
in
your
word.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
(voice

on
the
mississippi
side?
justice
byron

white
there's
an
accretion
on
the
mississippi
side
as
it
occurring
(voice

--
justice
byron

you
--
you'd
say
that
the

wasn't
avul

wasn't
accretive
at
all

justice

below
the

its
quite
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
mclendon,
can
i
ask
you,
what
if
the
--
what
if
in
doing
the
cutoff
that
the
project
had
included
anticipation
that
the
flow
of
the
water
would
run
against
the
louisiana
bank
and
it
might
be
better
just
to
stretch
it
out
right
at
the
outset.
if
the
corps
of
engineers
had
said,
“well,
we're
going
to
do
the
cutoff
but
then
we're
going
to
go
slice
off
50
yards
of
the
louisiana
shore
lines
or
bank,
river
bank,”
and
they
have
gone
having
done
it.
would
that
have
been
on
avulsion
on
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly,
the
thalweg
would
have
changed
thereafter.
there
would
have
been
a
new
main
channel
as
a
result
of
that
cutting
off
50
yards
of
the
louisiana
river
bank.
but
--
what
would
have
been
the
result
been
in
your
view
as
to
where
the
boundary
was?
would
it
have
been
the
thalweg
or
would
it
have
been
the
old
thalweg?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
--
but
you
say
it
wouldn't
have
been
an
avulsion
just
because
the
bank
was
cutoff
by
human-hand.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
the
only
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
it's

there's
been
an
avulsion
or
not
and
if
there
--
justice

white
--
there
hasn't
been

if
there
hasn't
been

if
we
agreed

we

need
to

you
even

you
even
go
further
and
say
that
the

where
the
thalweg
was
in

year

immaterial.

why

why

let's

we

that

point
the

did
shift
