mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
understand
the
issue
present
before
the
court,
it's
on
a
motion
of
the
state
of
louisiana
to
file
or
be
permitted
to
file
a
complaint,
an
original
action.
and
as
we
understand,
we
are
to
take
that
complaint
as
it
is
written
and
apply
the
law
as
this
court
has
written
it
to
the
facts
as
they
are
undisputed.
now,
to
begin
with,
i
think
that
what
the
court
said
in
arkansas
versus
texas
is
material
to
this
particular
observation
in
determining
--
the
court
said
this,
"in
determining
whether
the
interest
being
litigated
is
an
appropriate
one
for
the
exercise
of
a
reasonable
jurisdiction,
we,
of
course,
look
behind
and
beyond
the
legal
form
in
which
the
claim
of
the
state
is
pressed.
we
determine
whether
the
claim
is
that
of
the
state,
whether
the
state
is
indeed
the
real
party
in
interest.
we
think
it
has
been
amply
covered
but
we
want
to
restate
it
for
emphasis.
we
think
that
the
complaint
in
this
case
does
not
comply
with
that
rule
because
there's
no
charge
that
the
state
of
mississippi
is
or
has
been
or
is
attempting
to
deprive
the
state
of
louisiana
of
anything.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
it
is
not.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
we
will
may
defend
it,
your
honor
and
as
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
we
will
defend
--
may
defend
it
on
--
based
upon
the
ground
of
the
citizens
of
mississippi
who
had
sued
a
lessee
of
the
state
of
louisiana
because
of
peculiarities
of
the
two
--
the
law
of
the
two
states,
the
law
of
louisiana
being
the
--
the
state
owns,
as
trustee
for
the
people,
the
bed
of
the
navigable
stream,
whereas
the
louisiana,
the
abiding
property
owner
owns
the
bed
of
the
stream
to
the
boundary
line.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
if
the
court
please,
i
support
the
contention
of
my
colleague
that
the
thalweg
--
the
thalweg,
as
it's
been
called,
is
the
boundary
line
between
the
states
at
the
point
in
question.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
well,
this
engineer,
this
is
the
navigational
chart,
that
the
only
river
pallet
is
used.
they
follow
--
i
think
they
follow
that
red
line
that
is
the
thalweg,
the
main
channel.
according
to
the
engineer,
the
place
is
on
there,
the
oil
well
and
the
abiding
property
of
the
zuccaro
goes
out
to
that
river
stream
and
not
exactly
into
the
lower
--
the
property
goes
to
that
point.
now
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
if
it
is
determined
that
--
that
it
is
on
the
eastern
of
the
thalweg,
yes,
sir.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
yes,
sir.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
yes,
sir.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
yes,
sir.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
now,
that
--
that
i
want
to
get
into
that,
if
the
court
please,
in
just
a
minute.
i
want
to
explain
that
it's
our
understanding,
i
don't
think
it's
been
probably
brought
out
here
today.
but
i
want
to
explain
it
with
--
if
i
may
get
to
that
point
(inaudible).
louisiana
as
the
lessor
has
been
receiving
royalty
payments.
they
regulate
the
production
and
receive
taxes.mississippi
had
not
attempted
to
regulate
production
or
anything
else.
now,
this
court
has
held
that
its
original-jurisdiction
was
in
controversies
between
states
was
a
good
substitute
for
diplomacy
and
war
between
nations,
peculiar
to
our
federal
system.
and,
of
course,
in
two
cases
that
i
have
referenced
to,
war
or
armed
conflict
was
narrowly
averted,
that
is
louisiana
versus
mississippi
and
oklahoma
versus
texas,
oklahoma
versus
texas
having
to
do
with
oil
well,
louisiana
versus
mississippi
having
to
do
with
oyster
fishing
rights.
we
have
pointed
out,
we
think,
that
mississippi
is
not
presently
attempting
to
assert
any
jurisdiction
over
this
particular
property.
now,
with
the
court's
permission,
we
want
to
take
issue
or
something
that
mr.
carmouche
said
a
minute
ago
and
that
there's
a
presumption
of
bias
on
the
part
of
the
jury.
we
--
we
respectfully
reject
that
contention
and
now
ask
the
court
to
disregard
it.
we
think
it's
offensive
to
our
jury
system
as
it
exist.
and
of
course,
as
justice
goldberg
pointed
out,
that
we
--
if
the
--
if
it
is
finally
determined
that
this
oil
well
is
in
mississippi,
we
intend
to
exercise
jurisdiction.
now,
the
avulsion
which
was
caused
by
the
united
states
corps
of
engineers
joining
this
cutoff
here
is
that
cutoff
as
it
is
now.
this
is
the
map
in
1930
and
1940-41.
this
is
a
map
of
1962.
the
cutoff
leads
(inaudible)
bend
way.
and
this
became
the
main
channel
of
the
stream.
on
each
side
of
this
river,
because
of
that
avulsion,
the
state
of
mississippi
to
this
(inaudible).
the
boundary
line
goes
all
up
here.
that
is
the
remaining
boundary
and
continues
to
be
the
boundary
under
the
law
of
this
court
as
it
was
established
because
that
was
an
avulsion
and
avulsive
cutoff
immediate
and
so
that
something
remained
on
the
other
side
of
the
river.
now,
down
here
where
this
property
is
located,
the
(inaudible)
there
is
almost
(inaudible).
this
shift
has
been
gradual
and
imperceptible
and
this
court
has
held
that
--
that
is
a
natural
right,
i
believe
they
used
the
word
“natural
right'
it
--
because
he
who
stands
to
gain
by
an
accretion
is
not
law
--
responsible
to
anyone
for
because
he
could
not
recover
for
his
loss
by
an
erosion.
now,
that
was
what
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
natural
and
imperceptible.
but
it
does
not
necessarily
have
to
be
natural
according
to
st.
clair
county
versus
lovingston.
in
that
case,
as
long
as
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
--
as
long
as
it's
gradual
and
the
party
claiming
the
benefit
is
not
liable
and
did
not
construct
the
artificial
(inaudible).
in
that
case,
the
city
of
st.
louis
had
built
a
dike
out.
and
the
water
had
accreted
around
behind
it.
and
this
court
said,
following
the
old
common
law,
that
so
long
as
the
particular
individual
who
was
claiming
the
benefit
of
that
accretion
had
not
caused
it,
he
was
--
he
was
entitled
to
receive
the
benefit
side.
and
of
course,
the
rule
we're
talking
about
is
that
accretions
belong
to
the
abiding
property.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
yes,
sir.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
that's
right,
yes.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
natural
inquiry.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
well,
that
i
think
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
that
--
if
the
court
please,
we
submit
and
mr.
goldberg
read
the
particular
point,
paragraph
17
of
the
complaint,
we
submit
is
the
conclusion
of
the
pleader.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
well
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
well,
they
allege,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
man-made
avulsion
between
points
(a)
and
point
(b)
on
this
map,
holds
that
there
are
accretions
down
here
and
because
of
this
avulsion
to
point
(b)
that
it
should
--
that
it
effected
and
changed
the
property
ownership
down
to
this
point
and
we
admit
that
it
changed
the
property
ownership
here
and
changed
the
boundary
between
the
state.
but
we
say
at
point
(b)
at
the
foot
of
that
cutoff
and
this
is
mass
made
by
--
under
the
direction
of
the
president
of
mississippi
river
commission.
we
think
the
court
can
take
judicial
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
the
particular
problem
in
this
complaint
or
involved
in
this
point
is
below
the
cutoff,
outside
of
the
area
that
was
changed
by
avulsion.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
well
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
that's
right.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
well
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
--
if
--
if
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
if
the
court
please,
the
--
you
have
anticipated
me
once
more
and
we're
going
to
get
to
that
point.
we
think
that
if
the
court
follows
the
rule
that
it
first
announced,
in
(inaudible)
versus
illinois
and
continues
to
adhere
to
the
fact
and
the
latest
--
latest
expression
concerning,
it
was
in
mississippi
versus
louisiana
300
u.s.
and
continues
to
maintain
that
in
areas
like
this,
the
live
thalweg
is
the
boundary
line.
now,
that
has
been
followed
in
every
case
involving
states
boarding
upon
navigable
streams,
the
missouri
and
the
mississippi
river.
on
missouri
versus
kentucky,
louisiana
versus
mississippi,
arkansas
versus
mississippi
and
tennessee
and
all
other
states
up
and
down
the
river,
this
live
thalweg,
this
channel
that
the
river
both
kept
and
feud
because
it
is
followed,
the
main
channel
of
the
stream,
as
i
understand
that's
a
german
word
and
it's
been
used
worldwide
as
--
where
live
streams
or
boundaries
between
states.
now,
this
court
in
the
last
case
that
it
had
between
these
two
states,
used
the
live
thalweg
and
the
dead
thalweg
as
in
preference
to
metes
and
bounds
descriptions.
it
would
use
a
metes
and
bounds
description
to
the
point
where
the
river
still
flowed
or
whether
it
had
ceased
to
flow
but
was
still
un
--
underwater
and
they
would
use
the
dead
thalweg
or
the
live
thalweg
around
in
preference
to
metes
and
bounds.
and
the
--
the
best
this
court
could
do
would
be
establish
metes
and
bounds
and
this
court
has
heretofore
use
live
and
dead
thalweg
in
preference
to
metes
and
bounds.
they
asked
the
court
to
mark
this
boundary
from
here
to
here.
and
if
the
court
adheres
to
the
rule
that
the
live
thalweg
is
still
the
boundary,
we
submit
that
it
is
not
a
question
of
fact
because
there's
no
dispute
that
was
back
to
your
question
justice
--
mr.
justice
goldberg,
there
was
no
dispute
between
the
two
states
because
the
live
thalweg
is
as
definite
as
appositive
and
easily
as
determination
as
the
edge
of
this
desk
of
the
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
well,
i
mean
by
the
deadman,
this
area
that
goes
up
to
here,
the
live
thalweg
as
to
where
the
water
has
flown
since
--
flowed
down
the
river.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
yes,
sir.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
i
don't
believe
i
understand
your
question,
mr.
justice.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
yes.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
if
i
made
to
you
that
impression,
your
honor,
i
had
no
intention
of
doing
so.
the
new
thalweg,
as
i've
pointed
out
from
point
(a)
to
point
(b),
mississippi
is
on
this
side
and
mississippi
is
on
that
side
that
the
boundary
between
the
two
states
continues
to
go
up
here
because
this
was
an
avulsive
change
down
here,
below
point
(b)
during
these
areas
they
asked
to
be
governed
in
this
matter,
that
is
the
old
and
continuing
channel
of
the
river.
it
has
merely
shifted
by
reason,
i
think
everyone
can
see,
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
--
of
the
glasscock
cutoff
being
done.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
well,
if
the
court
please,
may
i
--
may
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
if
the
court
please,
i
--
i
still
have
not
--
i
have
not
attempted
to
represent
to
this
court
that
the
--
an
avulsive
change
changes
the
boundary
between
the
states.
i
have
only
attempted
to
represent
that
an
accretion
--
an
accretive
change
changes
with
the
--
the
river.
the
river
goes
with
it.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
they
say
that
the
--
they
say
that
any
change
from
this
point
down
to
here
is
brought
about
by
this
man-made
avulsion.
and
we
say
that
the
continuing
--
the
live
thalweg,
as
it
goes
to
down
here
all
the
way
to
here,
according
to
st.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
and
that
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
that's
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
that
is
our
understanding
of
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
that's
right.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
we
think
that
that
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
well,
the
only
case
we
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
--
we
have
that
is
that
the
case
is
with
this
particular
point.
i'm
not
certain
it
has
come
up
except
in
the
louisiana
supreme
court
case
but
we
have
cases,
a
continual
line
of
cases
where
this
court
has
held
that
the
live
thalweg
is
and
continuous
to
remain
the
boundary
between
the
states.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
well
we
--
the
--
if
there's
a
factual
issue
in
this
view.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
as
we
understand,
the
--
we
have
laid
too
long
on
this
particular
point
we
think
because
our
time
is
gone
but
we
won't
point
out
again
the
cases.
we
submit
that
louisiana
is
not
a
prop
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
it
was
american
conclusion
by
way
of
conclusion,
your
honor.
we
wanted
to
point
out
that
this
court,
heretofore,
in
examining
such
type
--
the
cases
of
this
type,
new
hampshire
versus
louisiana.
louisiana,
i
mean
new
york
versus
louisiana
and
massachusetts
versus
missouri
where
the
real
interest,
where
the
court
as
if
followed
it
through
and
looked
through
the
form
of
the
complaint
to
the
real
interest
applied
the
law
as
it
head
theretofore
written
it
and
came
up
with
the
conclusion
that
the
parties
and
interest
were
individual
citizens
and
not
states
and
that
the
states
stood
nothing
to
gain
or
nothing
to
lose
has
seemed
fit
to
--
to
dismiss
those
cases
or
to
decline
to
permit
them
to
be
filed.
we
--
by
way
of
complete
summary
want
to
say
that
we
don't
think
or
submit
to
the
court
that
the
complaint
states
a
justiciable
controversy
between
these
two
states
as
we
understand
the
opinions
by
this
court.
i
want
to
personally
thank
and
thank
from
the
state
of
mississippi
the
court
for
(inaudible)
and
receptive
here.
thank
you.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
would
like
to
open
our
argument
by
expressing
the
personal
and
the
precession
of
the
state
for
the
fine
scholar
and
the
gentleman
that
the
court
appointed,
the
special
master
to
here,
this
case.
the
fact
that
we
might
agree
wholly
with
his
factual
findings
as
will
be
presented
later
does
not
detract
from
our
high
regards
for
him
personally
and
as
a
legal
scholar.
we
think
he
found
the
law
of
mississippi
--
i
mean
not
all
of
them
mr.
justice,
of
the
united
states
as
it
is
and
correctly
found
that
the
--
based
thereon
he
declined
to
recommend
that
there'd
be
any
changes
in
that
law.
now,
we
argued
before
this
court
on
december
10th,
1963,
louisiana
had
taken
up
the
cordial
of
its
lessee,
humble
oil
and
refining
company
by
--
they're
trying
to
take
back
what
the
river
had
formally
given
them
and
taken
back
an
oil
well
to
its
lessee.
this
court
rejected
that
argument,
authorized
us
--
i
mean,
authorized
them
to
file
their
complaint.
but
now,
i
think
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
all
louisiana
is
interested
in
is
one
oil
well.
they
haven't
given
one
sound
legal
or
logical
basis
for
changing
the
boundary

the
live
and
flowing
mississippi
river
to
a
point
that
travels
across
vast
and
dry
land
--
across
mississippi
accretions.
they
haven't
given
one
reason
for
that
except
of
the
fact
for
that
there's
an
oil
well
involved.
now,
we
have
mississippi.
we've
lost
by
that
river's
action.
we've
lost
cases
before
this
court
on
the
thalweg
theory.
in
fact,
its
--
most
of
the
production
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
off
from
the
louisiana
courts
as
this
court
decreed
that
it
was,
was
at
one
time
a
point
of
controversy
between
mississippi
and
louisiana.
and
the
thalweg
theory
adopted
by
this
court
was
followed
by
the
court
and
took
it
away
from
it
and
that's
vast
field
of
oil
and
not
just
--
and
as
this
court
said
in
oklahoma
versus
texas,
irregardless
of
how
valuable
those
so
vacuous
rights
become,
value
has
nothing
to
do
with
changing
rules
of
jurisdiction
and
property.
as
this
court
has
heretofore
announced.
frankly,
we
would
delighted
to
hear
that
louisiana
does
not
even
take
issue
with
any
of
the
special
master's
findings.
and
the
special

louisiana
alleged
in
order
to
ask
this
court
to
take
jurisdiction
of
this
case
that
an
avulsion
occurred,
an
avulsion
within
the
bed
of
a
stream.
now,
we
denied
it.
special
master
found
that
an
avulsion
did
not
occur.
so
therefore,
it
should
be
dispositive
of
the
matter
because
they
did
not
prove
suddenness
or
perceptibility.
mississippi
was
put
to
the
burden
of
proving
that
all
of
the
changes
took
place
within
the
bed
of
the
river.
and
that
between
the
high
banks
of
that
river,
every
change
that
was
testified
to
occur,
one
of
our
witnesses
said
so
in
page
682
and
683
of
the
record.
another
one
said
so
on
818
and
8
--
again,
on
826
of
the
record.
of
course,
all
of
those
points
of
their,
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
they
said
that
all
of
the
changes
as
even
as
shown
by
this
--
as
he
put
it
an
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
--
amateur's
drawing
of
what
occurred
took
place
within
the
high
banks
of
the
river.
in
other
words,
there
has
been
no
abandonment
of
the
bed
of
the
stream
as
this
court
has
heretofore
call
for
when
it
even
considered
an
avulsion.
what
louisiana
is
doing
in
this
case
is
trying
to
put
the
court
before
the
horse.
the
facts
are
that
there
was
a
change
in
the
bed
of
the
stream.
that
stream
is
a
boundary
stream.
the
river
is
the
boundary
and
has
been
since
the
date
--
being
settled.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
our
records,
volume
4
and
5,
which
to
our
two
expert
witnesses
who
were
renowned
authorities
on
this
river
testified
and
the
--
special
master
accepted
that
testimony
on
the
fact
that
all
the
changes
within
this
river
bed
were
as
a
result
of
erosion
and
accretion.
since
we
filed
our
replied
brief
to
their
exceptions,
the
pre-factories
statement
if
the
court
will
look
at
it
on
opening
of
the
gray
brief
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
i
don't
think
it
would
have
been
an
avulsion,
your
honor.
i
think
that
certainly
the
corps
engineers
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
well,
according
to
the
rules
of
this
court
as
we
understand
it,
if
within
that
50-yard
area,
vast
land
appeared,
it
would
have
been
an
avulsion,
yes.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
see
what
you're
driving
at
and
i
don't
know
that
--
that
is
not
getting
close
to
what
happened
as
a
--
and
i
hate
to
apparently
beg
your
question
but
i
just
--
it
didn't
happen.
the
cutoff
was
through
here
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
--
and
that
is
a
very
distinct
cutoff.
and
i
think
your
question
itself
is,
if
i
may
suggest
is
--
i
mean,
implying
a
bad
motive
on
the
part
of
engineers
to
slice
up
a
part
of
a
state's
territory.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
i'm
sorry,
if
i
misunderstood
it
to
that
point.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
this
part
here,
your
honor?
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
i
don't
have
any
idea.
the
land
area,
i
understand
from
various
witnesses,
testimony
that
this
old
bend
way
is
approximately
19
miles
and
this
is
approximately
four
miles.
and
of
course,
there's
a
notice
being
an
argument
that
this
--
the
boundary
--
now
they
argue
that
the
boundary
became
fixed
up
in
here,
but
it
did
but
not
with
the
opening
of
this.it
continued
to
change
by
erosion
and
accretion
until
such
time
as
the
river
seize
to
flow
and
carry
navigation.
and
that's
the
point
where
i
mentioned
a
minute
ago
that
trying
to
put
the
cart
before
the
horse
because
navigation
never
ceased
in
this
area.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
the
avulsive
--
the
parts
of
the
river
that
were
cutoff
by
avulsion
would
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
we
don't
think
so
your
honor,
i
mean,
because
if
the
--
if
that's
what
they
tried
to
do
was
straightening
out
this
river
from
(inaudible)
to
new
orleans,
and
that
was
a
part
of
the
project.
and
where
they
have
changed
it
across
vast
lands,
the
boundary
itself
has
become
fixed.
and
this
of
course
is
still
a
flowing
river
but
on
both
sides
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
now
on
the
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
as
we
understand
it,
yes.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
that's
right.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
that's
our
understanding,
and
yes
because
the
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
--
not
because
of
the
cutoff
but
because
that
it
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
that
is
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
well,
that's
their
version
of
the
bs
--
x
line
of
the
course
of
one
that
mississippi
contends
for.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
that's
right.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
that's
the
boundary
that
never
did
ceased
to
flow
as
the
live
and
flowing
mississippi
river.
in
fact,
they
asked
for
the
fixing
of
a
33
boundary
because
this
alleged
that
the
hand
of
man
can
change
a
state
boundary,
they
asked
for
a
33
boundary
when
the
proof
shows
beyond
dispute
that
the
river
continued
to
migrate
into
mississippi
for
three
years
after
that.
now,
why
they
want
to
cut
themselves
off
of
that
extra
three
years
of
yard
is
i
don't
know
but
that's
the
--
the
river
was
continually
flowing
from
here
on
down
to
the
gulf.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
your
honor,
the
record
does
not
show
but
there
is
no
land
as
such
that
will
be
transferred,
it's
a
submerged
land.
it's
all
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
--
just
right
within
the
bed
of
the
river.
i
mean,
i
think
there's
some
2000
feet
between
the
high
banks
maybe
more,
maybe
less,
i'm
not
an
engineer.
i'm
not
even
an
engineer
to
the
point
of
drawing
one
of
these
amateur
things.
we've
got
to
use
the
evidence
that
the
engineers
fixed.
now,
this
same
argument
was
advanced
to
the
special
master.
and
on
page
21
and
22
of
the
record,
he
specifically
rejected
it.
he
says
it
may
be
for
the
court
to
change
but
i
can't
conscientiously
recommend
it.
that
he
started
all
the
case
flow
because
he
asked
them
on
more
than
one
occasion
during
the
trial
of
this
case.
do
you
have
any
authority
of
that
an
avulsion
can
occur
within
the
bed
of
a
stream?
and
they
haven't
come
up
with
it.
except
the
specific
point
in
the
three
case,
the
four
cases
they
discussed
except
within
a
specific
point
where
the
actual
dredging
took
place.
process
of
erosion
and
accretion
took
place
below
that.
now,
the
special
master
also
found
that
the
rules
of
erosion
and
accretion
are
to
be
preferred
in
all
instances.
that
is
when
a
boundary
stream
is
a
--
a
flowing
river
is
a
boundary
between
the
states.
now,
they
mentioned
the
thalweg
grew,
i
don't
think
that's
a
separate
rule.
the
thalweg
grew
was
established
in
iowa
versus
illinois,
so
landmark
case.
and
in
that
case
your
honor,
there
was
dredging
--
not
dredging,
actually
the
record
showed
that
the
rock,
hard
rock
was
excavated
to
change
the
navigable
channel,
300
feet
closure
to
the
iowa
side.
it's
a
case
in
that
--
that
the
issue
in
that
case
was
who
was
--
detached
the
bridges
across
the
river.
in
the
bank
shown,
page
4
of
the
special
report,
that
the
--
who
was
--
someone
dredged
out
300
feet
closer
in
order
to
make
access
to
united
states
canal
farther
on
up
the
river.
that
was
an
alleged
fact
and
admitted
for
the
purpose
of
this
court.
and
that
was
the
case
where
this
court
established
for
the
jurisprudence
of
this
country,
the
rule
of
the
thalweg,
that
is
along
the
main
mid-channel
of
navigation.
the
court
came
along
25
years
later
on
arkansas
versus
tennessee
and
said,
“the
rule
of
the
thalweg
was
settled
by
that
decision
and
we
will
not
attempt
to
tamper
with
it,”
that
is
just
25
years
ago.
that's
been
over
a
merely
hundred
now.
so
we're
not
just
talking
about
one
oil
well.
as
the
court
said
in
louis
--
oklahoma
versus
louisiana,
we
won't
change
the
jurisdiction
of
property
rule
because
of
mini-oil
well.
we're
talking
about
the
boundary
of
everybody
that
borders
on
navigable
streams
in
this
entire
country.
can
the
hand
of
man
change
it
from
a
flowing
stream
as
it
was
made
by
trees
before
the
country
was
a
nation,
when
it
was
still
a
nation
of
others?
that
it
was
made
on
by
nature,
as
it
was
made
by
acts
of
admission
and
in
truth
and
in
fact
was
stipulated
too
by
the
parties
in
this
lawsuit.
now,
one
other
significant
rule
that
we
think
is
important,
again
in
arkansas
versus
tennessee
where
this
court
said,
“it
is
settled
beyond
the
possibility
of
dispute
that
were
running
streams
are
the
boundaries
between
states,
the
same
rules
as
between
--
same
rules
applies
as
between
private
proprietors.
namely,
that
when
the
bed
and
the
channel
are
changed
by
the
natural
and
gradual
processors
known
as
erosion
and
accretion,
the
boundary
follows
the
very
thalweg
bearing
course
of
that
stream.”
then
of
course
it
goes
on
and
announces
and
in
a
--
and
that's
the
exception
to
that
rule.
and
that
case
if
the
court
please,
it'll
find
when
it
--
when
the
status,
that
was
the
same
case
that
said
even
though
there
is
an
avulsion,
the
boundary,
the
thalweg
boundary
continues
to
waiver
by
the
processes
of
erosion
and
accretion
until
such
time
as
the
streams
ceases
to
be
navigable.
and
there
is
not
one
shred
of
proof
anywhere
in
that
merely
a
thousand
pages
of
record
that
this
was
ever
anything
with
the
delight
of
employing
mississippi
river
down
from
the
beginning.
now,
the
rules
that
we're
talking
about,
that
is
erosion
and
accretion,
go
back
--
had
been
traced
back
by
this
court,
and
we
certainly
recognized
it
a
--
the
--
they're
tracing
back
was
more
further
than
we
could
possibly
do
it
but
they
were
traced
back
to
the
rules
of
just
any
end,
which
was
the
original
or
the
codification
of
the
common
law.
that
is
the
fact
that
erosion
and
accretion,
that
boundary
changes
property,
private
property
or
public
property,
boundary
changes
by
their
physical
fact
of
erosion
and
accretion,
the
boundary
moved
with
those
erosion
and
accretion.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
well,
there's
a
--
as
arkansas
versus
tennessee
said,
i
just
read
it.
it
was
the
same
rule
as
between
private
parties.
now,
in
st.
clair
county
versus
lovingston,
which
is
another
landmark
case
in
this
country,
this
court
held
as
a
matter
of
law
annunciated
the
issues
and
it
said,
one
was
the
mix
--
first
one
was
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law,
and
the
second
was
a
question
of
the
law.
then
the
court
said,
“it
is
insisted
by
the
learned
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
in
there
that
the
accretion
was
caused
wholly
by
obstructions
placed
in
the
river
above
and
that
thence
the
rule
under
the
subject
of
alluvium
do
not
apply.
if
the
fact
to
be
so,
the
consequence
does
not
follow,
there
is
no
warrant
for
the
proposition.
the
approximate
cost
of
the
deposits
made
by
the
water,
the
law
looks
no
further.”
we
have
no
doubt
that
that
language
--
in
similar
language
in
all
of
these
cases
is
what
prompted
this
--
the
special
master
on
page
17
where
it
vividly
do
point
out
that
the
court
always
looks
to
the
result
and
not
the
cause.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
yes,
your
honor.
kansas
versus
missouri,
it's
cited
in
our
brief
dealt
with.
the
corps
of
engineers
erected
dikes
to
--
for
the
specific
purpose
of
relieving
or
changing
the
channel,
and
the
court
held
it
--
that
was
not
enough
to
sustain
kansas
provision.
mississippi
versus
louisiana,
which
was
the
last
page
we
had.
this
two
states
had
anything
to
do
with
was
a
case
involving
one
of
these
15
cutoffs
that
extend
from
--
oh,
one
above
memphis
and
the
rest
of
this
is
the
lowest
in
the
chain
of
following
down
the
river.
one
of
this
15
cutoffs,
the
court
took
the
thalweg
around
the
bend
way
and
fixed
it
where
the
river
had
died
where
the
navigable
channel
had
stop.
and
in
the
areas
where
it
was
still
navigable,
the
thalweg
was
held
to
be
the
boundary
in
that
case
and
this
court
followed
it.
i
don't
know
where
they're
innocent
until
they
had
anything
to
do
with
artificial
thing,
but
in
--
if
the
court
will
note,
our
brief
also
in
134
alr
page
556,
there
is
an
excellent
annotation
on
erosion
and
accretion
and
the
artificial
causes
there.
i
mean
this
is
not
a
thing
that
would
--
this
court
has
been
plagued
with
original
actions
dealing
with
flowing
boundaries.
but
if
it
--
that's
louisiana's
theory,
that
for
no
reason
at
all
in
1932
that
boundaries
still
eroding
away
into
mississippi.
for
no
reason
at
all,
it's
because
of
few
drops
of
water
came
flowing
down
here.
that
boundary
became
fixed
if
not
only
would
--
they'd
just
--
i
can't
conceive
of
the
amount
of
litigation
that
will
resolve,
it's
bad
enough
already
with
each
others
throat
every
time
something
valuable
comes
up.
but
if
you
start
changing
the
rules
and
as
we
observed
in
our
brief,
it's
very
simple,
the
rule
are
--
let's
say,
somewhat
--
i
may
be
over
simplifying
and
i
hope
not,
certainly
the
special
master
thought
that
they
were
simple
and
to
the
point.
the
rule
is
erosion
and
accretion
and
the
one
exception
is
avulsion.
now,
the
reason
for
that
rule
is
because
people
don't
go
out
there
where
they
end
up
where
a
river
is.
i
mean,
the
river
is
flowing,
it's
alive,
it's
going
day
and
night.
and
the
rules
are
--
of
necessity
must
have
to
be
simple
because
it
can
get
to
the
most
complicated
facts
of
situations
in
the
world
even
with.
now
in
relation
to
that
one
oil
well,
what
flows
--
i'm
going
to
ask
the
clerk
if
he
will
distribute
to
the
members
of
the
court
copies
of
mississippi
exhibit
2.
we
had
him
taken
out
to
the
files
yesterday,
we
have
ten
copies
up
here.
and
would
ask
if
it
--
if
the
court
--
well,
it's
a
(inaudible)
copy
and
it
illustrates
the
point
that
we
think
needs
to
be
illustrated
at
this
time.
as
we
were
tracing
our
background
on
this
erosion-accretion
thing,
frankly
and
i
believe
was
the
man
who's
credited
by
this
--
all
of
having
brought
it,
transferred
it
to
the
common
law
and
this
has
been
adopted
as
i
pointed
out
in
st.
clair
versus
lovingston.
now,
what
we
point
to
illustrate
by
this
is
the
court
held
in
st.
clair
versus
lovingston
that
the
river
and
right
to
future
accretions
is
a
vested
right.
it
is
comparable
to
the
flux
the
owner
of
the
flux
and
he
--
being
entitled
to
the
increase
or
as
the
court
said
the
fruit
from
the
tree,
the
man
being
entitled
of
the
fruit
if
it's
barren.
now,
the
rule
--
it's
a
very
poor
rule,
it
doesn't
work
both
ways.
now
this
river
as
we
pointed
out
has
been
the
boundaries
since
the
beginning
of
history
of
either
these
two
states
as
states.
now,
this
that
i
handed
you
is
a
copy
of
the
--
from
the
land
office
of
mississippi,
it's
a
original
copy
of
an
original
survey
of
this
area
of
the
river.
now,
you
will
note
on
there
that
there
is
a
u-shaped
black
circle
on
the
--
starting
on
the
upper
left-hand
corner
and
coming
down.
there
is
a
different
shaded
circle
--
i
mean,
different
shaded
rectangle
of
a
thing
bordering
the
river.
and
over
on
the
right
of
that
different
shaped
rectangle,
the
thing
there
is
a
line
that's
written
on
there
proximate
bank
line
of
maximum
recession.
that
is
before
the
river
started
flowing
the
other
way.
the
point
of
this
illustration
is
that
mississippi
when
it
was
admitted
into
the
union,
this
particular
oil
deposit
that
louisiana
now
seeks
us
--
seeks
this
court
to
change
the
rules
for,
was
under
vast
lands
within
mississippi.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
that's
in
that
block
11
and
the
point
there
of
the
arrows
pointing
to
it
your
honor.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
that's
the
proximate
bank
line
of
maximum
recession.
this
is
--
that
what
you
see
over
there
on
the
left-hand
side
is
the
river
boundary
in
1832.
that
was
some
15
years
after
mississippi
became
a
state.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
mississippi
vast
lands,
in
fact
it
was
an
irregular
session
--
section
because
of
the
--
as
is
noted
there
on
the
left,
the
south
coast.
now
it's
noted
from
there
that
section
7
which
wasn't
irregular
section
has
gone
down
to
the
gulf
so
or
some
place
else.
it's
no
longer
there.
it's
gone
forever.
and
parts
of
16th
and
parts
of
10th
and
then
parts
of
3,
and
all
of
four
was
the
line
that
we
drew,
didn't
go
quite
that
far.
we
drew
it
for
emphasis
of
this
one
point.
mississippi
lost
this
oil
well
by
the
rules
adopted
by
this
court.
and
they
can
--
louisiana
can
speak
for
humble
oil
they
want
to.
but
we
don't
see
that
mississippi
should
now
after
a
natural
change
has
brought
it
back
in
the
mississippi,
there's
just
no
equity
or
justice
in
letting
us
lose
it
again
by
changing
the
rules.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
17,
pardon
me
your
honor.
i
was
looking
rather
far
of
that
from
of
there
than
you
--
you're
absolutely
correct,
section
17
is
gone.
that's
the
one
was
shaded
out
with
this
light.
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
yes
sir.
beg
pardon?
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
well,
my
associate
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
my
associate
counsel
mr.
teller
was
going
to
discuss
the
ramifications
of
it.
there
were
two
oil
company
--
mr.
martin
r.
mclendon
well,
i
mean
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
that
there
were
two
oil
companies
and
they
leased
both
sides
of
the
river.
and
they
had
a
surreptitious
agreement
between
them.
and
that
the
boundary
was
fixed
by
them
and
not
recorded.
so
whatever
their
consequences
i
think
that
they
have
made
there
bed
that
there
should
be
committed
to
--
by
it.
now
i
just
--
i
want
to
close
out
the
court
--
well.
i
just
--
one
last
thing,
we
asked
that
this
court,
not
change
the
state
boundaries
for
the
benefit
of
one
oil
well.
if
refused
to
do
it,
in
oklahoma
versus
texas
as
ample
present
to
everything
we've
said
and
i
promised
my
associate
that
i
would
divide
the
time
equally,
he
will
speak
to
the
other
issues.
thank
you
your
honors,
i
appreciate
it.
