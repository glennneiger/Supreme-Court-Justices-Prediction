justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
didn't
hear
that
quite.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
madden,
may
i
just
ask,
you're
not
suggesting
that
these
private
parties
are
necessary
for
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
you
might
--
your
position
is
you
could
have
brought
this
--
louisiana
could
have
brought
this
lawsuit
against
mississippi
and
have
ignored
what's
going
on
with
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
any
--
any
--
in
other
words,
what
you're
telling
me,
this
is
not
really
necessarily
a
fight
between
private
parties
in
that
sense,
is
that
it?
that
there
is
at
least
connected
with
that
kind
of
claim
something
of
mississippi's
claim
intertwined,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
well
in
the
riverbed
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
have
--
have
you
posed
an
issue
on
the
complaint
for
that
whole
12
miles?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
therefore
does
not
affect
louisiana's
claim?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
the
way,
may
i
ask
you
this,
you
told
that
the
humble
has
stop
paying
oil
lease
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
has
stop
paying
taxes
to
louisiana?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it's
affecting
louisiana's
allowable
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
doesn't
louisiana
say
the
same
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
follow
--
i
don't
--
i
didn't
follow
that
fact.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
you
--
when
you
--
may
i
just
--
are
you
just
suggested
that
what
they
want
have
done
in
this
action
is
that
they're
be
determined
as
of
1939
the
location
of
the
thalweg
as
of
that
date.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
they
say
is
different
by
reason
of
this
man-made
avulsion
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
on
its
location
today.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
say
that
19
--
it's
location
in
1939
marked
the
boundary
between
your
two
states.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
i
don't
quite
understand
how
this
differs
from
yours.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
below
the
cut.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
thalweg
maybe
a
shifting
thalweg
but
there
it
always
was
and
that's
always
marked
the
boundary
and
it's
only
within
this
bend
where
it's
disappeared
that
you
have
to
locate
the
existing
thalweg
to
fix
the
boundaries
and
if
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
teller,
what
fact
(inaudible)
in
this
lease?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
several
times
emphasizes,
recognition
that
the
boundary
may
change
because
the
thalweg
changes
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
do
and
i'm
referring
particularly
natural
action
of
the
river
and
accretion
or
erosion
resulting
there
from.
but
my
understanding
is
that
the
claim
of
louisiana,
as
pleaded
is,
that
whatever
has
happened
to
that
thalweg
below
the
foot
of
the
cutoff,
is
not
to
natural
action
of
the
river
but
has
been
due
to
the
man-made
avulsion
of
--
of,
namely,
the
cutoff
just
above.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
wouldn't
that
make
a
different
in
the
law
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
teller,
don't
you
have
to
say
that
sure,
there's
been
a
shift
in
--
in
favor
of
mississippi
but
if
the
shift
through
the
natural
action
of
the
river
and
louisiana
says
it
is
not,
it's
a
shift
due
to
this
cutoff
man-made
avulsion
and
therefore,
the
ordinary
rule
which
would
give
you
the
benefit
if
it
were
due
to
natural
action
of
the
river
doesn't
apply
but
the
old
location
of
the
thalweg
determined
whether
it's
louisiana
or
mississippi
and
why
isn't
that
a
controversy
between
the
two?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
a
question
of
law,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
may
suggest,
mr.
teller,
i
would
suppose
then
that
if
procedure
means
much
in
these
cases
have
--
doesn't
mean
as
much
that
uses
that
--
your
tactic
is
not
an
opposition
to
the
motions
were
filed
but
rather
let
them
file
on
a
motion
to
the
solicited
complaint
on
the
ground
it
doesn't
state
the
cause
of
action.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
why
--
why
--
that's
the
reason
why
we
refused
to
accept.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
may
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
may
be
--
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
two,
you
said
all
you
want
to
state
in
support
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
if
you
had
filed
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
really
what
they
say,
mr.
mclendon,
in
17
is,
this
--
isn't
it,
that
surely
it's
accretive
below
the
cutoff
but
nevertheless,
it's
accretive
due
to
avulsion
because
they
say
the
glasscock
cutoff
being
man-made
is
a
close
natural
mean
and
avulsive
at
any
event.
as
i
understand
it
means
that
even
if
accretive
below,
that
that's
brought
on
the
change
in
the
location
of
thalweg.
nevertheless,
that
accretion
is
due
to
an
avulsive
action
whether
man-made
or
natural,
i
don't
care.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
as
i
read
17
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
words
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
used
is
any
movement.
of
course,
you
mean
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
movement
of
the
thalweg.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
they're
right,
there's
an
accretion
to
the
land
owned
by
the
riparian
owners
by
reason
of
the
shift
of
the
thalweg,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
but
as
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
accretion
to
that
land?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
used
the
word
“movement”
anyway,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
do
you
mean
over
at
17,
as
i
read
you
correctly
is,
saying
what
i
suggested,
the
adversary
you
meant,
the
glasscock
cutoff
being
man-made
as
opposed
to
natural
means
and
avulsive
in
any
event?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
caused
the
movement
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
the
banks
in
the
river
changed
there
or
just
the
thalweg?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
wise
the
(inaudible)
this?
why
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
don't
take
your
time.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
(inaudible)
--
where
the
court
find.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that
what
was
avulsive.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
with
the
cutoff,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
find
that
on
page
51.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
--
there's
no
controversy
here
about
what's
inside
the
view,
the
19
by
4.
all
of
that
enclosed
in
there
is
mississippi,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
and
the
--
it's
no
longer
navigable
around
the
bend
and
therefore
wherever
the
old
thalweg
was,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
fixes
the
boundary
between
louisiana
and
mississippi,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
bank
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
(inaudible)
is
that
little
segment
below
the
cutoff
area
that
on
this
map
is,
b,
c,
x.b,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
b,
x
is
the
one
that
the
master
has
taken
in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
b,
c,
x
is
the
old
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
know
of
any
other
cases
of
(inaudible)
st.
clair
that
dealt
specifically
with
the
matter
of
artificial
man-made
causes
of
erosions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
in
that
block
11
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
those
--
would
you
tell
me
again
mr.
mclendon,
what's
that
proximate
banking
of
maximum
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
all
of
11
was
mississippi
vast
land.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
one
with
the
yellow
circle
you
said
going
down?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
live
thalweg?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
mr.
teller,
i
managed
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
am
i
right
in
what
you're
in
effect
saying
is,
if
you
were
right
that
it's
a
live
thalweg
that
the
severance
forming
between
the
two
states,
where
it
was
located
on
a
particular
date
may
have
a
relevance
to
this
private
litigation
but
it
has
no
relevance
to
any
issue
between
the
two
states,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
therefore
that
--
there
is
no
reason
for
us
to
get
into
a
location
which
is
significant
only
to
private
parties
and
that's
what
you
say.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
a
--
i
take
this
position
have
to
had
another
essential
fact
if
that
is
that
you
are
in
agreement,
that
both
states
are
in
agreement
as
to
where
the
thalweg
was
in
1964
and
then
every
year
thereafter.
you
have
no
current
dispute
as
to
where
it
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
okay.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
