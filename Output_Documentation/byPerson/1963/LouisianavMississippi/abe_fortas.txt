justice
abe
fortas
you
said
seven,
did
you
mean
17?
justice
abe
fortas
that
would
mean
--
i
wonder
mr.
teller
that
it
--
go
back
to
the
district
court
following
your
thought
as
to
what
don't
happen
and
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
then
that
would
have
to
be
litigated
there.
justice
abe
fortas
okay.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
justice
abe
fortas
the
state
is
not
a
party
to
that.
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
you're
saying
--
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
teller,
i
want
to
get
this
straight
if
i
can,
what
you're
saying
is
that,
the
only
issue
that
this
court
ought
to
decide
is
the
issue
of
theory
of
principle,
that
is
to
say,
we
--
you
had
it
the
way
you
want
it
if
this
court
would
say
no
to
louisiana's
request
that
we
adjudicate
the
proper
line
to
be
the
1932
line.
justice
abe
fortas
but
we
just
say
no
and
then
stop
there,
is
that
your
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
we
don't
go
into
what
is
the
line
of
thalweg
as
in
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
particular
time.
justice
abe
fortas
why
did
you
take
the
year
1932?
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
effect
upon
which
you
relied
did
not
occur
then,
did
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
doesn't
--
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
talking
about
the
--
you're
referring
to
the
avulsive
act
and
as
the
date
that
first
started
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
digging.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
would
there
be
an
effect
on
humble's
claim
on
this
lawsuit
if
the
cut
in
1941
rather
than
1932?
