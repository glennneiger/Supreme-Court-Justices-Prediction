mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
an
assistant
attorney
general
of
virginia,
i
appear
as
counsel
for
the
state
board
of
education
and
the
superintendent
of
public
instruction
of
the
commonwealth.
these
respondents
first
became
defendants
in
this
suit
when
the
amended
supplemental
complaint
was
filed
by
order
of
court
on
august
the
14th,
1961.
at
that
time,
the
defendants
asserted
a
series
of
defenses
and
contentions
against
the
suits
sought
to
be
set
up
against
them
in
the
amended
supplemental
complaint
and
we
have
continued
consistently
thereafter
to
assert
these
defenses.
thus,
we
have
taken
the
position
that
the
suit
sought
to
be
setup
in
the
amended
supplemental
complaint
is
in
its
direct
purpose
and
effect
a
suit
against
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
which
has
not
consented
to
be
sued
and
is
expressly
forbidden
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
we
have
taken
the
position
that
the
amended
supplemental
complaint
states
no
claim
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted
against
these
respondents.
we
have
taken
the
position
that
the
amended
supplemental
complaint
states
a
new
and
distinct
cause
of
action
different
from
that
setup
in
the
original
complaint
which
cannot
properly
be
maintained
in
an
amended
supplemental
complaint.
and
we
have
stated
that
the
amended
supplemental
complaint
asks
relief
in
the
nature
of
the
enjoining
of
the
enforcement
operation
and
execution
of
a
state
statute
which
relief
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
cannot
be
granted
except
by
district
court
of
three
judges.
the
district
court
in
its
opinion
set
out
on
page
160
of
the
record
detailed
all
of
these
points
which
we
made,
set
them
for
consideration
when
the
trial
was
heard
on
the
merits
at
a
later
date
and
these
points
were
argued.
that
was
the
last
we
have
ever
heard
of
these
contentions.
i
make
this
statement
with
more
than
passing
justification
where
i
refer
to
the
language
of
the
fourth
circuit
set
out
on
page
five
of
my
brief,
in
which
the
majority
pointed
out
this.
for
the
district
court
to
get
to
the
merits,
it
had
to
bypass
a
number
of
preliminary
questions,
including
a
very
troublesome
question
arising
under
the
eleventh
amendment,
all
of
which
are
brought
up
before
us.
now
we
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
if
the
fourth
circuit
had
not
decided
to
abstain
until
the
virginia
supreme
court
had
considered
what
precisely
was
the
nature
of
the
virginia
system
and
this
case
had
gone
back
to
them
from
that
decision
that
we
would
have
had
all
of
these
contentions
considered
by
the
fourth
circuit.
but
we
take
the
position,
that
due
process
of
law
no
matter
how
it
maybe
construed
assuming
it
applies
to
the
respondents
in
this
case
as
it
does
to
the
petitioners
which
of
course
it
does,
necessarily
requires
that
these
contentions
which
we
have
made
be
considered
at
some
time
by
some
judicial
tribunal.
we
suggest
in
view
of
the
action
what
this
court
has
taken
that
they
must
now
be
considered
by
this
judicial
tribunal.
so
far
as
the
eleventh
amendment
question
is
concerned,
we
have
set
out
in
our
brief
a
number
of
cases,
none
of
which
the
solicitor
general
has
dared
to
mention
in
which
we
have
pointed
out
that
the
line
of
demarcation
between
a
suit
which
seeks
to
enjoin
a
state
official
from
taking
action
under
an
unconstitutional
statute,
that
is
a
suit
which
seeks
a
cessation
of
action
by
state
officials
as
contrasted
to
a
suit
which
affirmatively
seeks
to
require
state
officials
to
perform
a
duty
alleged
to
be
place
upon
them
by
the
law
is
the
line
of
demarcation
between
suits
which
are
not
forbidden
by
the
eleventh
amendment
and
suits
which
clearly
fall
within
the
prohibition
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
now
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
amended
supplemental
complaint
alleged
that
the
state
officials
whom
i
represent
had
failed
to
discharge
the
obligation
placed
upon
them
by
the
virginia
constitution
to
maintain
a
system
of
free
public
schools
throughout
the
state
and
it
asked
a
peremptory
writ
of
mandamus
to
compel
the
state
officials
to
operate
public
schools
in
prince
edward
county.
now
they
did
not
ask
for
the
peremptory
writ
of
mandamus
in
so
much
--
in
so
many
words.
they
asked
for
an
injunction
to
enjoin
the
state
officials
from
refusing
to
operate
the
schools
in
prince
edward
county.
now
this
sort
of
strategy
has
been
laid
to
rest
in
the
case
of
louisiana
versus
jumel
which
we
cite,
in
which
the
court
has
said
that
suits
of
this
nature,
a
suit
to
mandamus
a
public
official
to
perform
an
act
or
a
suit
to
restrain
a
state
official
from
refusing
to
perform
an
act
under
a
state
statute
raise
identical
questions
and
constitutes
a
suit
against
the
state
within
the
prohibition
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
if
we
may
paraphrase
the
language
of
this
court
in
hagood
versus
southern,
a
suit
requesting
the
relief
which
is
here
requested
by
the
petitioners,
that
is
that
state
officials
spend
money
which
they
do
not
have,
which
has
not
been
appropriated,
and
affirmatively
begin
to
operate
the
public
schools
in
prince
edward
county.
if
a
suit
requesting
this
relief
be
not
a
suit
within
the
inhibition
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
it
would
be
difficult
to
conceive
the
frame
of
one
which
would
be.
as
the
court
said
in
hagood
versus
southern,
a
judgment
against
state
officials
in
their
official
and
representative
capacity
commanding
them
to
perform
official
functions
on
behalf
of
the
state
according
to
the
dictates
and
decrease
of
the
court
is,
if
anything
can
be,
a
judicial
proceeding
against
the
state
itself.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes,
your
honor,
but
not
against
state
officials.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
against
a
locality
and
we
do
not
assert
that
the
eleventh
amendment
covers
a
locality.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
it
was
because
the
initial
legislative
decision
to
issue
the
bonds
and
lay
the
tax
had
already
been
made
by
the
elected
representatives
of
the
people
and
that
in
requiring
the
local
board
of
supervisors
to
lay
the
tax,
the
federal
government,
the
federal
court
was
giving
them
contract
relief
which
they
would
have
been
entitled
to
under
state
law
and
would
have
obtained
even
if
the
matter
had
been
heard
in
a
state
court.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes,
your
honor,
i
do
because
i
think
those
cases
clearly
turn
upon
the
fact
that
there
had
been
a
contract
by
the
local
people
to
pay
the
bonds.
and
they
were
suiable
on
their
contracts.
we
don't
take
the
position
that
a
locality
is
not
suiable
on
its
contracts
or
that
if
the
people
have
decided
and
have
contracted
with
bond
holders
that
they
will
levy
a
tax
that
that
contract
cannot
be
enforced.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
no,
sir.
that
case
actually
happened.
the
court
invalidated
the
subsequent
enactment
as
being
in
violation
of
the
federal
constitutional
prohibition
against
the
passage
of
a
legislation
impairing
the
obligation
of
contracts,
and
then
enforced
the
right
to
which
the
petitioners
were
entitled
under
the
original
law.
every
one
of
those
cases,
mr.
justice
black,
is
a
contract
case
on
a
debt
for
a
liquidated
sum
after
the
representatives
of
the
people
had
contracted
and
agreed
that
they
would
levy
the
tax.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
no,
sir.
only
one
of
them
--
only
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
sir?
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
only
one
of
the
cases
was
that
matter
an
impairment
of
contract
did
arise.
in
all
the
others,
the
legislature,
i
mean
the
local
governing
body
just
simply
did
not
pay
the
debt,
they
just
fell
into
default
and
the
court
said,
“you
can
be
mandamus.
the
state
court
would
mandamus
you.
we
can
mandamus
you
because
you
have
already
exercised
the
legislative
discretion.
you
have
contracted
the
debt
and
you
as
a
municipality
or
just
as
suiable
as
if
the
case
with
brown
against
smith.
it's
not
brown
against
the
city
of
quincy
or
what
have
you
and
any
one
of
those
cases
or
the
labette
county
commissioners.
under
the
eleventh
amendment,
the
locality
is
just
as
suiable
as
a
private
party.
we
don't
state
that
but
the
state
is
not
and
if
the
state
repudiates
its
debt,
this
court
cannot
require
the
state
to
levy
the
tax
unless
the
state
has
entered
into
a
contract
with
another
state
which
would
come
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
which
is
not
this
case
at
all.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes,
well.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes.
if
they
did,
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
suppose
that
sort
of
thing
would
fair
exactly
the
same
way
as
a
subsequent
enactment
trying
to
withdraw
the
taxing
power
from
the
locality
which
existed
in
one
of
these
cases.
in
other
words,
i
should
think
that
any
attempt
to
repudiate
a
debt
by
the
locality
would
raise
that
question.
in
other
words,
so
far
as
the
eleventh
amendment
is
concerned,
we
do
not
assert,
we
never
have
asserted
that
the
eleventh
amendment
erects
any
shield
for
local
officials.
we
say
that
it
does
erect
the
shield
with
respect
to
the
relief
sort
in
this
case
of
requiring
the
state
officials
to
operate
public
schools
in
prince
edward
county
and
we
cite
a
number
of
cases
which
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
difference
between
enjoining
state
officials
from
acting
under
an
unconstitutional
statute
which
means
they're
enjoined
in
their
personal
capacity
because
the
unconstitutional
statute
gives
them
no
immunity
and
those
which
require
a
state
official
affirmatively
to
perform
its
obligations
is
the
line
of
demarcation
between
eleventh
amendment
suits
and
fourteenth
--
and
of
suits
which
are
not
within
the
scope
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
no
sir.
i'm
going
to
make
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
no
sir.
i
am
going
to
make
--
when
the
opportunity
arises,
a
very
strong
argument
against
all
on
the
bond
cases
that
you
cannot
require
a
locality
to
exercise
its
discretion
in
the
first
instance
that
there
is
no
judicial
authority,
not
because
of
the
eleventh
amendment
but
simply
because
of
the
division
of
powers
for
this
court
to
tell
prince
edward
county
that
it
must
lay
a
levy
for
public
schools
in
the
city
of
cleveland,
that
it
must
lay
a
levy
for
public
parks
in
the
city
of
--
in
any
city
in
colorado
that
it
must
engage
in
a
state
local
hospitalization
program
or
medicare
or
anything
else.
unless
the
local
people
have
decided
to
undergo
that
program,
we
say
there
is
no
judicial
power
in
any
court
in
the
united
states
to
tell
a
city,
“you
must
lay
a
levy
and
embark
upon
this
program.”
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
well,
if
your
honor
please,
if
the
tax
--
if
the
enactment
of
the
tax
is
conditioned
upon
an
unconstitutional
requirement,
we
have
a
far
different
proposition
–
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
that
is
james
against
almond
your
honor.
that
is
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
it's
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
well,
it
may
come
to
that
mr.
justice
black,
but
our
position
here
is
that
you
cannot
equate
those
two
situations
when
a
locality
says
as
it
has
the
undisputed
right
to
do,
we
are
not
going
to
spend
any
money
for
any
school,
integrated
or
segregated.
it's
not
a
matter
of
conditioning
the
appropriation
upon
the
character
of
the
school.
we
just
aren't
going
to
have
schools
in
prince
edward
county
just
as
the
city
of
fairfax,
15
miles
from
where
your
city
as
a
political
subdivision
of
virginia
that
don't
have
a
public
school
in
it.
they
just
decided
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes
your
honor
but
i
was
brought
into
the
remedy
situation
first
by
your
honor's
question
about
the
bond
cases.
our
basic
premise
is
of
course,
that
there
is
no
right
which
requires
a
remedy,
that
they
have
no
right
whatever
to
be
provided
with
public
schools
in
prince
edward
county.
this
is
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
i
don't
say
that
at
all.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
i
say
they
have
the
right
to
do
it
and
i
say
every
decision
has
been
decided
in
the
fifth
and
fourth
circuit
with
respect
to
any
public
facility
clearly
bears
that
out.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
the
board
of
supervisors
has
a
right
not
to
appropriate
funds
for
the
operation
of
public
schools
for
any
reason
which
it
seems
fit,
including
the
reason
that
they
would
be
operated
on
racially
integrated
basis
if
the
money
were
appropriated
and
this
is
tompkins
and
gilmore,
and
cases
without
ending.
i'm
running
over
my
time,
i
apologize.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
oh
we're
going
to
finish.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
i
see.
in
that
case
your
honor,
i
will
proceed
right
away
then
to
the
question
of
the
right.
we
take
the
position
that
what
is
here
required
by
the
petitioners
is
this.
they
say
that
they
have
a
right
to
be
provided
with
public
schools
in
prince
edward
county.
this
is
what
they
say.
now
brown
said
and
we
admit
this,
that
they
have
a
right
to
racially
nondiscriminatory
access
to
such
public
schools
as
operated
in
the
county,
but
that
there
is
no
provision
in
the
federal
constitution
which
requires
the
state
to
operate
any
public
schools.
second,
we
say,
that
this
court
has
never
held
that
any
truly
local
option
law
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
this
is
a
point
which
i
feel
i
must
stress.
no
decision
of
which
i
am
aware
and
no
decision
contained
in
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
holds
that
a
local
option
law
is
unconstitutional
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
there
is
no
such
case.
now
in
virginia,
we
have
a
truly
local
option
system.
our
state
supreme
court
has
made
that
perfectly
clear.
whether
or
not,
public
schools
will
be
operated
and
locality
is
a
decision
which
is
made
by
each
individual
locality.
it
has
been
this
way
since
the
foundation
of
our
public
school
systems
were
laid
in
1869.
it
was
that
way
when
virginia
was
readmitted
to
the
union,
that
principle
was
carried
on
in
the
constitution
of
1902
and
it
exists
today.
nothing
having
to
do
with
local
option
was
fashioned
on
a
post
brown
basis
over
the
idea
of
concocting
any
evasive
schemes
to
continue
segregated
education
in
virginia.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
no,
sir.
what
i'm
saying
is
this,
that
you
cannot
say
that
the
virginia
local
option
laws
which
had
existed
for
100
years,
constituted
an
invasive
scheme
to
circumvent
any
orders
of
this
court.
that's
what
i
want
to
say.
now
on
the
local
option
proposition,
i
do
say
that
a
local
option
law
in
which
you
have
a
statewide
program
in
which
state
aid
is
made
available
to
each
and
every
locality
of
the
state
which
elects
to
come
under
it,
provided
the
locality
meets
certain
minimum
requirements,
i
say
that
that
is
constitutionally
unassailable.
as
the
majority
of
the
fourth
circuit
said,
“any
such
program
is
that
which
is
engaged
in
by
every
state
in
the
union
which
the
federal
government
engages
in,
in
which
it
lets
the
states
wish
to
come
up
to
the
minimum
requirements,
participate,
pays
money
to
those
states
which
elect
to
come
under
the
program
and
doesn't
pay
money
to
those
which
do
not
elect
to
come
under
the
program
is
constitutionally
unassailable.
we
will
not
see
the
solicitor
general
stand
before
this
court
and
urge
to
it
that
the
national
defense
education
program
is
unconstitutional,
but
it
is
a
clear
local
option
program
which
is
available
only
to
those
cities
and
counties
in
the
united
state
which
elect
to
insert
in
their
curriculum
those
provisions
for
advanced
mathematics,
modern
foreign
language
and
science
for
which
alone
the
federal
government
is
willing
to
make
its
money
available.
now
this
is
straight
local
option,
and
it
is
available
to
everyone
who
wishes
to
come
under
the
program.
in
virginia,
three
of
our
cities
have
elected
to
come
under
the
program.
must
the
federal
government
discontinue
aid
to
those
simply
because
three
other
cities
in
virginia
have
elected
not
to
come
under
the
program,
and
that
is
precisely
what
we
have
here.
virginia
for
100
years
has
had
a
local
option
program
in
which
every
locality
in
the
state
which
elects
to
operate
public
schools
and
which
appropriates
funds
therefore
may
have
state
aid.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
it's
on
a
formula
basis
your
honor.
it's
not
on
a
matching
form
--
it's
not
on
a
matching
fund
basis
because
certain
localities
make
a
greater
effort
and
get
a
large
proportion
of
the
funds.
certain
localities
will
appropriate
quite
a
bit
as
much
as
75%
to
80%
of
that
budget
because
they
will
go
beyond
what
the
state
requires
and
will
spend
more
money
even
though
the
state
will
not
match
it.
but
so
far
as
the
matching
state
funds
are
concerned,
they
are
available
only
upon
the
condition
that
the
locality
has
provided
certain
minimum
funds
and
it's
undertaken
to
operate
schools
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
now
the
constitutional
minimum
goes
to
the
locality
for
whatever
use
they
wish
to
make
of
it.
in
one
year,
prince
edward
--
they
have
no
use
for
it
at
all,
didn't
even
take
it.
but
under
the
constitution
all
that
virginia
is
required
to
give
in
the
way
of
financial
assistance
is
that
constitutional
minimum.
anything
beyond
that
constitutional
minimum
comes
within
the
scope
of
section
129,
that
virginia
shall
provide
a
statewide
system
in
every
locality,
a
plan
for
it.
and
our
state
court
has
clearly
said
that
we
have
established
that
plan
when
we
set
it
up
on
the
same
basis
of
the
national
defense
educational
program
or
other
federal
programs
in
which
a
locality
is
permitted
to
participate
if
it
elects
to
have
schools
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
it
wouldn't
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
no
sir,
i
mean,
within
the
educational
framework.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
that
constitutional
minimum
is
set
up
in
article
9
of
our
constitution
relating
to
the
public
schools
your
honor.
and
it
can
only
be
used
for
the
repair
of
people
–
public
buildings,
public
school
buildings
or
for
payment
of
teacher
salaries
or
for
anything
that
relates
to
the
operation
of
public
schools
or
the
maintenance
of
public
schools.
that's
what
it
has
been
used
for
in
prince
edward
county.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
no,
sir.
if
it
is
used
at
all,
it
must
be
used
for
the
--
for
public
school
purposes.
that's
why
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
it
goes
so
far
as
to
say
whether
or
not
the
money
will
be
spent
at
all
is
solely
up
to
the
locality
your
honor.
the
$40,000
constitutional
minimum
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
--
does
not
have
to
go
to
the
locality
unless
the
locality
select
--
elects
to
take
it.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
but
it
has
used
--
yes,
your
honor,
but
it
has
used
it
to
maintain
the
buildings,
not
to
operate
in
the
schools
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes
your
honor.
yes,
the
maintenance
of
the
school
buildings
which
are
owned
by
the
school
board.
they
are
not
operated
by
the
school
board
because
they
have
no
money.
the
board
of
supervisors
has
not
appropriated
any
money
to
operate
the
school.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
and
so
they
have
elected
to
take
the
constitutional
minimum
and
maintain
the
buildings
during
the
interim.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes.
i
mean
this
is
the
method
by
which
it
is
done.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
no,
sir.
constitutionally,
i
do
not
think
it
would.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
no
sir.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes
sir,
because
the
result
would
still
be
no
schools
within
a
particular
locality,
which
we
say
they
have
a
perfect
right
to
do
and
on
this
we
rely
on
the
tompkins
case
and
the
gilmore
case
in
which
the
localities
elected
not
to
operate
parks,
not
to
operate
schools,
playgrounds,
libraries,
or
any
facility
that
had
to
be
operated.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes,
your
honor.
but
this
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
no
sir.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
no
sir.
the
end
result
is
no
public
facilities
for
anyone
under
your
proposition.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
if
they
pass
a
law
for
that
purpose?
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
well,
if
it
has
that
result.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
well
then
i
think
if
your
honor
please,
if
it
has
that
unconstitutional
purpose
and
gives
rise
to
that
unconstitutional
result,
then
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
because
your
honor,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
result
and
at
the
rights
which
are
being
asserted,
and
see
whether
or
not
a
right
exists
and
what
effect
the
law
has
upon
the
right.
now
we
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
if
it
accomplishes
that
result,
your
honor,
then
i
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes
your
honor,
if
it
had
that
purpose
and
that
effect
of
being
an
unlawful
discrimination
as
forbidden
by
the
brown
case
or
any
decision
of
this
court,
but
there
is
no
decision
of
this
court
which
says
the
abolition
of
public
facilities
in
a
locality
for
everybody
accomplishes
any
impermissible
discrimination.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
and
the
courts
have
said
that
it
doesn't.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
it
is
not
a
matter
of
whether
we
have
to
your
honor.
the
question
is,
is
it
a
constitutional
right
to
do
it?
does
the
state
have
the
power
under
the
constitution
to
refer
a
decision
to
the
localities
for
exercise
of
their
local
option?
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
if
it
accomplishes
that
result
in
the
end,
your
honor,
but
that
is
not
what
has
happened
here.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
but
when
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
pragmatically
what
has
happened
your
honor
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
very
well.
if
i
may
say,
pragmatically
what
has
happened
is
that
some
half
of
the
virginia
school
districts
are
operating
on
racially
integrated
basis
right
now.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
the
others?
they
have
either
not
begun
to
desegregate
or
no
--
request
has
been
made
to
desegregate
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
now
in
prince
edward
county,
the
public
schools
have
not
been
operated
because
the
board
of
supervisors
has
not
appropriated
any
money
to
operate
public
schools
which
they
have
a
perfect
right
to
make.
now
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
well
i
say
your
honor
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
mwell,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor
for
this
--
i
mean
--
i
think
it
brings
your
question
and
i
will
come
to
it
in
a
minute
but
i
don't
think
that
it's
beside
the
issue
because
i
think
every
case
that
is
--
that
exists
on
the
point
clearly
establishes
the
right
of
the
locality.
we
have
cited
numerous
decisions
in
which
the
right
of
the
locality
to
close
a
public
facility
rather
than
operate
on
integrated
basis
has
been
held
to
violate
no
unconstitutional
rights.
the
fifth
circuit
has
held
it.
the
fourth
circuit
has
held
it.
the
abolition
of
all
public
facilities
within
a
geographical
area
eliminates
the
discrimination
forbidden
by
the
fourteenth
amendment,
infringes
no
rights
of
negro
plaintiffs,
and
violates
no
order
of
the
court
even
after
a
court
has
entered
an
order
against
the
city
requiring
it
to
refrain
from
the
racial
discrimination,
the
operation
of
public
parks.
the
city
has
come
along
and
said,
“alright,
we'll
close
the
public
parks”
and
the
courts
have
said,
“that's
no
violation
of
our
order.
we
didn't
tell
them
they
had
to
operate
public
parks.
what
we
told
them
was
you
cannot
discriminate
in
those
parks
which
you
do
operate,”
that's
all
brown
said.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
on
the
basis
of
race.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
but
this
is
not
any
such
discrimination,
your
honor,
because
the
tuition
grants
which
are
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
pragmatically,
it's
not
your
honor
because
the
tuition
grants
which
are
available
to
the
people
in
prince
edward
county
are
available
for
use
at
segregated
or
integrated
schools.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
because
i
think
your
honor,
it
would
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
if
a
program
is
racially
nondiscriminatory
and
if
the
result
which
arises
is
--
arises
simply
because
of
the
fact
that
certain
people
will
not
make
use
of
the
avail
--
the
educational
opportunities
to
which
your
honor
have
given
them
even
though
they
would
--
could
be
operated
on
an
integrated
basis.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
because
the
people
of
prince
edward
county
decided
that
they
were
not
going
to
operate
public
schools,
publicly
owned,
publicly
controlled
in
prince
edward
county
on
a
racially
integrated
basis.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
this
is
why
they
were
closed
but
the
tuition
grants
--
the
tuition
grants
are
available
for
the
operation
by
any
private
parties
of
any
integrated
or
segregated
school.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
the
local
option
on
any
basis
your
honor
without
any
reference
to
anything
except
geography.
and
we
say
that
there
is
no
decision
of
this
court
on
the
books
from
john
jay
to
this
day
or
from
1868
when
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
adopted
to
this
day,
in
which
this
court
has
ever
held
that
a
local
option
statute,
a
straight
local
option
statute
which
gives
each
political
subdivision
of
the
state
the
power
to
choose
whether
or
not
it
will
or
will
not
come
under
a
statewide
program,
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
well,
if
your
honor
please,
it
doesn't
violate
the
constitution
because
there's
no
requirement
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
but
your
honor
that
is
not
the
end
result
of
the
program.
it
doesn't
divide
people
in
the
schools
because
of
their
race.
if
the
state
--
i
mean
if
people
are
divided
in
their
races
–
because
of
race
in
private
schools,
this
is
no
concern
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
and
it
is
no
concern
of
the
states
whether
or
not
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
but
the
state
has
no
plan,
your
honor.
the
tuition
grants
are
available
and
have
been
available
to
the
people
regardless
of
the
kind
of
school
which
they
use
them
to
go
to.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
no
sir.
they
did
not
wish
to
have
white
and
colored
children
enrolled
in
public
schools
in
prince
edward
county
operated
by
the
public
school
board
and
subject
to
public
control,
that's
all.
the
tuition
grant
is
available
to
any
school
integrated
or
segregated.
it
makes
no
difference
whatever
and
as
mr.
gravatt
has
pointed
out
in
his
brief,
this
has
been
a
method
by
which
more
rather
than
less
integration
has
been
achieved
in
a
number
of
parts
of
the
country
and
a
number
of
our
tuition
grants
have
been
used
by
negro
citizens
all
over
the
state
of
virginia
to
send
their
children
to
schools
in
the
district
of
columbia,
public
schools
in
district
of
columbia
because
they
believe
that
integrated
education
obtainable
in
the
district
of
columbia
is
better
for
them
than
the
education
which
they
received
in
virginia.
and
tuition
grants
are
available
for
some
400
schools
all
over
the
united
states,
a
public
school
in
vermont,
petite
school
in
new
jersey,
philips
exeter
and
[inaudible]
--
which
school?
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
no
sir.
they
were
passed
for
the
purpose
of
enlarging
the
freedom
of
people
to
select
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
your
honor
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
no
sir,
i
don't
think
they
are.
the
object
of
the
tuition
grant
program
is
simply
to
let
those
people
who
elect
to
use
them,
decide
where
they
will
send
their
children
to
school,
and
the
state
has
no
interest
at
all
in
whether
it's
an
integrated
or
a
segregated
facility,
no
interest
whatever.
all
that
the
state
requires
is
that
it'd
be
a
school
to
operate
--
giving
a
minimum
foundation
of
education
and
as
i
say,
they
have
been
used
to
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
i
think
yes
your
honor
because
i
don't
think
that
the
tuition
grant
program
is
actually
before
this
court.
i
don't
think
that
because
i
don't
think
there
was,
that
the
three-judge
district
court
was
empaneled
to
hear
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute.
i
think
the
basic
issue
here
is
whether
or
not,
if
petitioners
in
this
case
have
a
right
to
be
educated
in
public
schools
in
prince
edward
county,
that
is
the
schools
operated
by
the
school
board
in
prince
edward
county.
now
if
they
have
that
right,
then
it
is
unquestionably
been
denied
them
because
there
are
no
public
schools
operated
in
prince
edward
county.
there
aren't
any
public
schools
being
operated
in
the
city
of
fairfax
15
miles
down
the
road.
there
aren't
any
public
schools
being
operated
in
the
city
of
franklin
either.
the
people
in
those
areas
have
elected
not
to
have
any
public
schools
but
to
foster
the
education
of
their
citizens
by
tuition
grants
and
tuition
payments.
if
somebody
in
the
city
of
fairfax
filed
a
suit,
claiming
that
his
federal
constitutional
rights
have
been
denied
him
because
the
city
fathers
have
decided
that
they
would
not
build
any
public
schools
or
establish
them
or
go
to
the
expense
but
would
simply
give
them
tuition
grants
and
make
tuition
payments,
would
not
such
a
person
receive
exceedingly
short
script
at
the
hands
of
this
court
if
he
attempted
to
assert
any
such
federal
constitutional
right
as
that,
that
he
has
a
right
to
public
schools
in
his
own
political
subdivision
or
that's
what
he's
being
asserted
in
this
case?
they
claim
that
they
have
a
right
to
have
this
court
make
the
board
of
supervisors
of
prince
edward
county
open
and
operate
public
schools
in
prince
edward
county.
mr.

i
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
well,
i
think
your
honor,
you
have
to
decide
what
the
right
is
that
they're
asserting.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
but
your
honor
they
say
in
their
brief
that
they
have
a
declared
right
to
education
in
public
schools
in
prince
edward
county
on
a
racially
nondiscriminatory
basis.
that's
the
right
which
they
assert
and
they
don't
have
that
right
anymore
than
the
people
in
the
city
of
fairfax
or
the
city
of
franklin
have
that
right
and
that's
why
you
have
the
difficulty
with
the
remedy.
that's
why
the
solicitor
general
stands
here
and
makes
the
bold
assertion
that
this
court
has
the
authority
to
require
a
political
subdivision
to
exercise
the
initial
legislative
function
and
lay
a
levy
to
support
public
schools
when
it
is
decided
not
to
do
so
and
in
support
of
that
proposition,
cites
such
cases
as
the
bond
cases
in
which
the
court
did
no
more
than
grant
a
right
which
existed
under
the
state
in
which
the
right
asserted
was
a
contract
liquidated
right,
and
in
which
the
initial
legislative
decision
to
undertake
the
program
had
already
been
exercised.
the
solicitor
general
can't
cite
any
case
to
this
court
in
which
this
court
has
held,
“we
have
a
right
to
tell
a
locality,
you
got
to
operate
public
schools.
you've
got
to
lay
or
levy
your
tax
to
do
it.”
you've
got
to
have
public
parks.
you've
got
to
have
a
hospitalization
program.
you've
got
to
have
a
library
program.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
a
constitutional
right
to
have
a
sheriff
to
do
it?
no
sir.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
no
sir.
not
as
such.
not
as
a
sheriff
as
such,
i
believe
that
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
well,
with
equivalent
terms,
i
think
a
person
of
course
does
have
a
constitutional
right
not
to
be
lynched.
i
didn't
know
whether
if
your
honors
--
how
a
sheriff
do
it
or
state
official
or
something
like
that,
yes,
alright.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
no,
your
honor.
no
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
but
i
have
not
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes
sir,
i
understand
that.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
no
your
honor.
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
carry
it
so
far.
i
said
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
that's
right
and
i
say
that
they're
constitutionally
not
required
to
have
schools
at
all.
i
do
not
say
that
a
right
--
that
a
constitutional
right
which
the
state
must
recognize
can
be
referred
to
local
option.
i
don't
say
that
at
all.
i
don't
say
that
they
are
not
some
constitutional
rights
which
cannot
be
referred
to
local
option,
but
the
right
to
go
to
a
school
in
one
political
subdivision
doesn't
exist.
it
never
has
existed.
nobody
has
a
right
to
go
to
a
public
school
in
their
locality
if
the
city
fathers
in
that
locality
decided
that
they're
not
going
to
have
any
public
schools
for
any
reason
and
if
the
petitioners
in
this
case
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
oh
yes.
we
admit
this
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
but
that
was
exactly
true
in
all
of
the
cases
we've
cited
tompkins,
gilmore,
and
so
forth.
it
was
admitted
that
if
the
state
or
the
city
had
the
public
facility,
they
could
not
bar
people
from
the
use
of
them
on
account
of
their
race,
but
the
closing
of
the
facility
was
the
exercise
by
that
locality
of
its
constitutional
right
to
decide
whether
it
would
operate
the
facility
at
all.
this
was
a
power
reserved
to
the
city
fathers
which
the
constitution
has
not
taken
away.
and
we
say
that
if
this
court
decides
that
it
can
say
to
prince
edward
county,
you
ought
to
lay
the
following
levy,
you
are
to
appropriate
the
amount
raised
by
that
levy
to
the
public
--
to
the
school
board
and
that
they
are
to
use
it
to
operate
the
following
schools,
in
other
words
divest
every
citizen
of
prince
edward
county,
every
elected
public
official
of
prince
edward
county
with
any
control
of
the
system
and
your
honors
running
then
i
say
this
will
be
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
this
nation
that
this
court
has
ever
undertaken
to
say,
we
can
order
a
locality
to
lay
a
tax
and
carry
out
a
program
which
we
think
should
be
carried
out.
it
will
be
the
first
time
in
which
this
court
has
said
a
local
option
statute
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
constitutionally
of
course,
there
is
no
difference
whatever
between
public
schools
and
public
parks,
and
playgrounds,
and
libraries,
or
any
other
public
facility.
the
decisions
of
this
court
had
made
that
perfectly
clear
that
you
can't
discriminate
on
the
account
of
race
in
schools
or
parks,
or
playgrounds,
or
anything
else.
if
it's
a
public
facility,
it's
constitutionally
identical.
consequently,
you
can
close
the
parks
and
the
swimming
pools,
and
the
playgrounds
which
you
unquestionably
can
do
under
the
decisions
then
a
locality
may
close
its
public
schools.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
no
sir,
i
do
not
think
so.
i
don't
think
that
it
can
be
argued
that
there
are
anymore
public
schools
and
going
back
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
you
can
argue
that
a
school
which
has
students,
which
--
who
have
had
tuition
grants
under
the
gi
bill
of
rights
are
public
schools.
when
i
returned
from
the
pacific
world
war
ii,
i
went
to
the
university
of
virginia
with
a
lot
of
veterans,
and
that
the
university
of
virginia
received
an
awful
lot
of
federal
money
and
that
didn't
make
the
university
of
virginia
an
instrumentality
of
the
federal
government.
and
i
can
take
it
one
step
further,
there
were
certain
people,
a
vast
number
of
veterans
i
submit
who
returned
from
the
war
and
went
to
princeton
and
harvard.
and
i
submit
that
millions
of
dollars
were
paid
to
princeton
and
harvard
on
their
account
and
that
neither
princeton
nor
harvard
ever
became
an
agency
of
the
united
states
government
simply
because
the
money
was
paid.
that's
all
what's
done
in
this
case.
no
control,
nothing.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
no
sir,
they
are
not.
they
are
not.
the
people
in
prince
edward
county,
the
white
people
formed
a
foundation.
they
went
out.
they
got
contributions.
they
built
a
school.
they
used
--
made
their
schools
and
churches
as
mr.
gravatt
has
said.
they
offered
an
educational
program.
the
same
opportunity
was
available
and
as
the
fourth
circuit
found,
the
negroes
declined
property
systems
in
undertaking
exactly
the
same
program
for
themselves.
but
it
is
my
view
that
the
simple
payment
of
money
to
a
child
in
reimbursement
of
tuition,
whatever
type
of
school
the
child
may
select
to
go
to,
no
more
has
the
effect
of
converting
that
institution
into
a
public
school
or
public
institution
than
does
the
federal
gi
bill
of
rights
converted
princeton
and
harvard
into
agencies
or
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states
government.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
no
sir,
not
as
such.
they
do,
they
are
permitted
to
maintain
their
retirement
here
under
our
retirement
system.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
no
more
so
than
social
security
for
princeton
and
harvard
educators
would
be
under
the
federal
government
your
honor.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
i
submit
that
any
--
the
persons
working
for
princeton
or
harvard
university.
they
maintain
a
relation
to
the
federal
government
by
virtue
of
their
social
security.
does
this
make
them
a
government
agency?
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
it
means
--
yes
sir
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
under
the
agreement
for
the
pension
plan.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
no
sir
because
that
isn't
a
public
school
system.
that
is
a
retirement
plan
which
operates
for
a
wide
variety
of
citizens
in
virginia.
it
has
no
relation
to
the
public
schools
any
more
than
social
security
does.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
no
sir,
not
the
teacher's
retirement
system,
that's
just
(voice
overlap)
that
is
one
face
of
that
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
that
is
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes
sir,
but
they
are
in
the
teacher's
retirement
system.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
because
your
honor,
the
state
retirement
system,
the
teacher's
retirement
system
is
a
segment
of
an
overall
state
retirement
system
in
which
(voice
overlap)
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
well
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
so
far
as
the
teacher's
retirement
system
but
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
alright.
so
now,
i
say
that
that
raises
no
more
relation
between
the
teacher
and
the
state
for
the
purpose
of
constituting
that
institution
in
which
the
teacher
performs
her
function
a
state
institution
than
does
social
security
granted
by
the
federal
government
to
teachers
in
princeton
and
harvard
make
that
institution
a
government
institution.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes
your
honor.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes
your
honor.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
by
simply
--
by
filing
under
the
system.
i
am
certain
that
that
is
correct.
i
will
certainly
check
it
but
i'm
--
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
--
that
it
pertains
to
any
private
--
any
private
teacher.
mr.
r.d.
mcilwaine
iii
i
would
like
to
confer
by
doing
a
rebuttal.
