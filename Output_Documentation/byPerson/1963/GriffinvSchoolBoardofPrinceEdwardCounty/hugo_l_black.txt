[inaudible]
justice
hugo

black
for
which
the
grant
had
--
which
the
grant
came.
justice
hugo
l.
black
paid
by
the
general
taxpayers
of
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
be
because
of
the
injunction
that
there
are
no
grants
and
aid
to
the
pupils?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
the
white
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
been
an
existence
ever
since?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
remains
an
issue
here,
does
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
whole
state
of
virginia
had
done
that?
suppose
the
whole
state
of
virginia
or
an
entire
state
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
–
had
decided
it
wouldn't
run
public
schools
anymore?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
just
decided
they
didn't
want
to
run
public
by
any
reason
at
all
and
so
there
would
no
more
public
schools
in
virginia?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
is
–-
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
is
that
the
constitution
give
us
the
right
to
determine
that
the
states
will
do
something
because
we
think
it's
necessary
to
be
done
for
the
people,
unless
the
constitution
requires
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
can,
what
i'm
really
--
your
time
is
getting
short,
i
thought
your
point
for
was
probably
your
--
the
point
that
you
were
arguing
and
presented
to
us
more
vigorously,
the
state
might
have
a
perfect
right.
assume
that
the
state
had
the
perfect
right
to
abandon
all
of
these
public
school
systems.
if
you
can
show
as
you
seem
to
assume
there
that
the
state
is
doing
this
in
this
county
as
a
part
of
a
plan
which
you
had
in
mind
denying
people
the
right
to
get
an
education
on
the
ground
of
color.
it
has
that
consequence
and
that's
what
it
was
done
before
and
it
has
that
consequence
and
you
can
get
a
finding
of
some
kind
of
that
effect,
either
of
finding
of
facts
of
inclusion
of
law,
you
would
have
a
much
narrow
point
than
you
are
presenting
on
(voice
overlap),
would
you
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
any
finding
of
the
district
judge
on
that
fact?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
did
the
court
find
that
that
was
a
part
of
a
state
plan
whereby
although
the
state
would
not
abandon
them
all
at
one
time,
that
that
was
a
state
plan
under
which
when
necessary
to
do
so,
it
ceased
having
education
in
one
county
or
one
area
of
one
county.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
arguing
now
that
the
--
you're
getting
that
in
your
first
point
as
i
gather,
that
the
constitution
can
bill
every
state
in
the
union
to
run
public
schools?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
on
the
basis
of
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that,
i
understand
that.
you're
saying
that
virginia
is
involved
in
carrying
out
a
plan
of
state
action
by
which
certain
people
are
denied
the
right
to
go
to
schools
on
account
of
their
color.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
is
quite
separate
and
distinct
it
seems
to
me
from
an
argument
that
virginia
cannot,
if
it
wishes,
abandon
its
public
school
system.
and
maybe
you
might
have
a
different
argument
as
to
whether
it
could
abandon
the
part
of
the
state
and
not
in
the
other,
but
the
argument
--
i
can
understand
your
argument
if
you
base
it
on
the
facts,
that
this
is
a
state
course
of
conduct,
state
course
of
conduct
which
in
denial
of
the
right
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
ends
up
in
denying
people
the
right
to
go
to
school
on
account
of
their
color
or
permitting
other
people
to
go
to
school
because
of
their
color.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
in
substance
that
the
purpose
and
object
of
this
plan
and
its
[inaudible]
was
to
keep
from
having
any
schools
where
whites
and
blacks
go
together?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
main
object
was,
i
gather,
i'm
not
sure,
the
main
object
was
i
gather
to
keep
[inaudible]
so
that
the
people
--
the
individuals
didn't
choose
to
go
in
the
school
together,
they
didn't
have
to
go
under
virginia's
plan.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
a
part
of
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
a
part
of
a
statewide
plan?
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
the
state
in
their
educational
system,
a
statewide
plan
that
some
can
have
local
option
or
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
this
is
all
a
part
of
the
general
plan
which
came
in
effect
after
brown
versus
maryland?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
have
to
consider
that
tuition
grant
on
that
basis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
suppose
it
was
shown,
i
don't
say
it
is
but
i
just
want
to
ask
you,
suppose
it
was
shown
that
virginia
passed
the
law
and
says
we're
going
to
have
a
--
we're
not
going
to
have
any
integration
in
any
school
in
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
sorry.
suppose
they
just
said
it
in
their
own
genuine
language,
ingeniously
just
frankly,
they're
not
going
to
have
it
and
they
said
we
are
creating
a
system
here
whereby
we
can
prevent
it,
a
statewide
system.
it's
going
to
work
in
this
way
that
they're
going
to
give
grants
to
parents
in
order
that
they
can
avoid
it
and
we're
going
to
provide
another
part
of
the
system
whereby
through
our
system
of
local
opportunity,
the
counties
that
wants
to
prevent
this
integration
can
take
advantage
of
these
grants
and
have
private
schools
--
what
they
call
private
schools
where
the
state
doesn't
want
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
isn't
that
what
you
have
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
your
argument
is,
as
i
understand
it,
i
think
[inaudible].
your
argument
is
that
you
have
a
right
to
do
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
even
though
it's
a
part
of
a
statewide
system.
the
aim
and
purpose
and
consequence
of
this
is
to
have
certain
counties
if
they
reach
that
point
where
they
will
not
have
any
integrated
--
integration
in
any
school
in
the
county,
public
or
private?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
the
basis
--
that's
the
basis
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand,
but
using
--
getting
away
from
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
all
of
these
languages
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
exactly
what
it
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
question
is
whether
that's
constitutional.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
is
it
against?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
ground
of
saying
that
they
can
force
them
to
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
you
wouldn't
--
you
wouldn't
base
that
on
the
fact
that
that
is
contract
relief
instead
of
some
other,
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
passed
a
law
or
ordinance
in
the
county,
saying,
if
we're
not
going
to
pay
this
debt,
could
they
be
required
to
pass
another
order
saying
they
would?
justice
hugo
l.
black
based
on
denial
of
a
constitutional
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
didn't
have
any?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can
put
him
on
a
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
state
directed
on
local
communities
to
repudiate
their
debts,
i'm
asking
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
really
exploratory
questions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
local
community
here
had
against
--
i
am
asking
this
question
merely
following
your
argument,
suppose
the
local
community
here
had
passed
a
rule,
a
local
authority
saying
that
we're
not
going
to
raise
any
taxes
for
the
purpose
of
sending
children
to
school,
public
schools,
we're
going
to
have
public
schools,
we're
not
going
to
raise
any
taxes
to
it.
let
them
pay
the
public
schools
of
the
money
if
they
mix
up
the
races.
what
would
you
say
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
--
that
is
partly
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
where
it
would
finally
get
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
there
is
an
unconstitutional
condition
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
that
they
can't
be
sued,
but
they
haven't
done
anything
here
which
justifies
them
to
be
sued
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
it'd
be
just
the
same.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
understand
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
makes
it
unconstitutional
to
pass
a
law
which
is
designed
to
discriminate
against
people
on
account
of
their
color?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
it
does
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
do
you
think
that
the
purpose
of
it
is
to
provide
and
that
it
does,
i'm
not
talking
about
now
in
this
case,
it
does
say
that
if
a
state
passes
law
so
as
to
discriminate
against
people
on
account
of
their
color,
it
is
an
invalid
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
it
has
that
purpose
and
that
result?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
a
great
deal
is
said
about
motive
and
purpose
and
so
forth,
those
things
that
are
--
mental
things
into
mind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
can
it
be
determined
that
a
state
has
or
has
not
done
something
in
order
to
discriminate
on
account
of
color
without
trying
to
find
out
why
they
did
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
agree
to
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
if
it's
not
to
discriminate
on
account
of
color
by
reason
of
a
state
law.
of
course,
that
wouldn't
make
any
difference,
but
suppose
it
is
then
it
accomplishes
that
result?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
we
get
back
to
the
question
of
whether
they
can
do
that
which
i
thought
maybe
the
brown
case
had
forbidden,
a
state
to
pass
law
which
by
one
means
or
another,
i'm
not
talking
about
evasion,
i
don't
see
any
evasion
because
i
don't
see
that
either
one
of
these
gentlemen
tried
to
evade
the
issue.
if
it
pass
and
if
it
does
pass
the
law
for
that
purpose
and
has
that
consequence
of
discrimination
being
an
unlawful
discrimination
as
set
out
in
the
brown
case,
wouldn't
it
be
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
if
the
whole
state
had
done
it,
you
got
a
lot
of
people
involved
in
the
state,
but
a
lot
of
people
and
the
discrimination
between
persons
--
between
persons
why
--
why
do
you
have
to
only
consider
the
person
within
a
certain
county
boundaries?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
finally
gets
down
to
this
as
i
understand
your
argument
which
is
a
really
frank
argument.
it
gets
down
to
this
seemingly
to
me
that
the
argument
is
that
it
does
not
involve
and
deny
equal
protection
for
a
state
to
have
a
whole
plan
of
government
within
the
state
with
reference
to
its
school
some
of
which
they
call
it
public
and
some
of
which
private,
is
passed
that
way
in
order
to
prohibit,
we
will
say,
to
bar
--
to
permit
a
county
to
keep
its
people
from
having
to
sit
together
because
they
are
white
and
black
and
it
accomplishes
that
result
in
the
end
that
that
would
not
be
unconstitutional.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
does
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
has
happened.
i'm
talking
about
pragmatically
what
happened.
i'm
not
talking
about
what
happened
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
with
reference
to
a
legal
definition
of
the
difference
between
abolishing
and
doing
a
way
with
it
and
what
actually
happened
and
what
has
actually
happened
here
in
that
respect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happened
--
how
about
the
others?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happened
in
prince
edward
county?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
that
gets
to
the
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
they
have
a
perfect
right
to
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
did
brown
said
was,
no
state,
no
state
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
can
discriminate
and
described
discrimination
as
i
understood
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
the
basis
of
racial
integration
or
segregation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
pragmatically?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
--
suppose
that
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
use
that
knowing
it
would
result
in
just
exactly
what
it
has
resulted
in,
and
it
actually
resulted
in
it,
what
difference
would
it
make
and
what
language
it
was
framed
whether
it
was
done
ingeniously
or
in
genuinely?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
a
state
--
if
they're
doing
that
by
state
violates
a
constitution,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
it
does
it
by
local
option
or
some
other
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
are
you
saying
--
you're
saying
that
it
doesn't
violate
the
constitution
for
the
state
to
have
a
plan,
the
end
result
of
which
is
to
divide
people
in
the
schools
on
account
of
their
race?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
(voice
overlap)
plan
to
do
it
that
way,
it's
quite
different,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
the
court
found
and
i
thought
it
was
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
anyhow,
that
the
whole
object
of
the
entire
plan
that's
called
massive
resistance
or
something
else,
was
to
keep
from
having
white
and
colored
people
go
to
the
same
school.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
passed
--
were
they
passed
for
the
purpose
of
discriminating
against
races?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
were
not
--
were
they
passed
for
the
purpose
of
defeating
decision
of
the
constitution
which
said
that
a
state
can't
have
a
plan
whatever
it
called
it
that
does
result
in
carrying
on
segregation
in
the
schools.
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
any
of
them
passed
for
that
reason?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they're
not
talking
about
it,
are
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
can
we
decide
this
case
really
genuinely
on
the
basis
that
the
state
has
no
interest
in
whether
they
are
--
shouldn't
be
together
in
the
same
school
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
do
they
claim
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
answer
the
question
i
suppose
the
question
does
it
just
to
say
they
make
that
claim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
claim
they
have
a
right
not
to
have
the
state
have
a
plan
in
operation
for
the
purpose
and
with
the
effect
of
preventing
integration
of
people
who
go
to
school?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
say
i'm
sure
that
they
do
not
have
a
right
to
be
barred
from
going
into
certain
locality
on
account
of
their
race?
