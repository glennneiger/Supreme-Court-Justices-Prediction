county,
et
al.
mr.
carter,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
are
receiving
the
tax
deductions,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
subsidization
does
this
foundation
or
the
parents
of
the
students
who
attend
the
school
receive
by
the
tax?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
received
none
from
the
state.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
carter,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
general,
there
is
some
money
of
the
state
being
expended
on
the
public
schools
in
that
county,
is
there
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
is
dispersed
by
the
school
board
and
by
the
county
commissioners,
is
it
not,
for
the
credibility
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
maintenance
of
the
building?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
their
school
buildings?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it's
same
thing
that's
done
in
every
other
part
of
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
i
mean,
but
they
are
--
are
still
expending
some
of
the
state's
money.
chief
justice
earl
warren
exactly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
take
five
minutes
more
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
respondents
may
have
the
same
amount
of
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
do
that,
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
counsel
may
reply
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gravatt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any
other
school
--
any
school
in
that
county
where
public
–
children
would
go?
chief
justice
earl
warren
wouldn't
you
then
be
running
a
public
school
if
they
have
done
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gravatt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
resolution
of
the
board
of
supervisors
in
prince
edward
county
in
may
1956,
ever
been
repealed?
in
accordance
with
the
will
of
the
people
of
the
said
county,
no
tax
levy
shall
be
made
upon
the
said
people
for
revenue
derived
from
local
taxes,
shall
be
approved
for
the
purpose
of
operation
and
maintenance
of
public
schools
in
said
county
wherein
white
and
colored
pupils
are
taught
together
under
any
plan
or
arrangement
whatsoever.
has
that
ever
been
repealed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
your
position
is
then
that
--
that
one
may
--
they
passed
the
resolution
which
permitted
the
use
of
these
public
school
buildings
by
the
negroes
with
the
right
to
have
anyone
else
they
wanted
in
there,
that
you
were
actually
abandoning
this
principle
and
were
actually
operating
public
schools
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
wait
a
minute,
you're
actually
operating
public
schools
in
your
county
on
an
integrated
basis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
you
were
operating.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
spend
some
$50,000
a
year
to
maintain
those
buildings
and
[inaudible]
them
and
to
operate
them
in
all
respects,
did
you
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
school
board
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
that's
public
money
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
public
money
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
permitted
--
you
permitted
these
people
to
go
in
there
and
operate
a
school
for
any
children
in
the
county
that
wanted
to
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
is
a
public
school,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
and
it
--
and
you
were
--
you
say
it
wasn't
in
--
would
be
an
integrated
school.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
haven't
you
abandoned
your
principle
of
not
having
segregated
schools?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
why
do
you
object
--
why
do
you
object
to
having
other
schools
integrated
in
the
same
way
if
you've
completely
abandoned
your
purpose
of
segregation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
who
has
a
right
of
choice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
have
no
plan,
have
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
no
plan
in
prince
edward
county.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
public
school.
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
provision
in
the
constitution
says
to
maintain
public
schools
and
you
say
according
to
the
plan
of
the
local
governments,
you
have
no
fund?
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
or
should?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
these
little
children,
these
little
colored
children
who
have
had
no
education
or
no
opportunity
for
education
in
the
last
several
years
that
they
had
freedom.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
they
have
freedom?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
mean
freedom
to
go
through
life
without
education.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcilwaine.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this?
i
have
in
mind,
now
you
may
have
been
cited
in
your
brief
the
series
of
cases
in
which
affirmative
action
has
been
required
forcing
the
laying
of
a
tax
to
pay
debts.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
you're
not.
we're
going
to
finish
tonight.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcilwaine,
when
you
say
that
the
local
communities
can
spend
that
constitutional
minimum
in
any
manner
they
choose,
do
you
mean
in
any
manner
they
choose
for
public
schools,
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
do
you
mean
for
any
purpose
whatsoever?
chief
justice
earl
warren
within
the
educational
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
your
constitution
that
gives
local
community
the
right
to
spend
that
money
if
it
has
no
public
schools?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
can
a
--
does
your
local
option
program
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
can
use
a
little
money
for
the
state
educational
system
or
public
schools
but
that
it
didn't
go
any
farther?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
then
you
spend
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
has
elected
to
take
it
and
has
used
it
here
and
it
has
used
it
for
the
public
school
buildings
at
least.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
true
but
that
--
that's
a
school
purpose,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
it
make
any
difference
to
your
argument,
mr.
mcilwaine,
the
legislature
in
passing
this
law
and
said
--
so
you're
making
this
plan
for
local
option
in
connection
with
the
school
and
object
and
purpose
is
to
give
the
counties
the
ability
if
they
see
fit
to
close
up
the
school,
public
school,
in
order
to
prevent
whites
and
blacks
sitting
in
the
same
school
together.
would
that
make
any
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
--
do
your
teachers
maintain
any
connection
with
--
with
the
state
government
or
the
local
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
a
part
of
their
compensation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
they
don't
--
they
don't
have
any
social
security
except
for
people
who
are
working
for
them,
do
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
now,
we
had
a
different
situation
here.
here
you
have
teachers
who
build
up
certain
rights
under
your
pension
system
and
then
you
abolish
the
public
schools
and
set
up
--
you
let
them
set
up
what
they
claim
to
be
private
schools.
and
still
the
state
says,
“we'll
recognize
your
pension
rights
and
the
time
that
you
put
in,
in
these
private
schools
will
enlarge
your
rights
under
our
pension
program”
and
that
means
paying
state
money
to
them,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
you
are
in
the
sense
maintaining
these
teachers
under
your
public
school
system,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
anybody
who
isn't
in
the
school
system
get
into
the
teacher's
retirement
system?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here,
the
teacher's
retirement
system.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
were
in
the
retirement
system,
you
close
your
public
schools
and
these
people
are
still
in
your
teacher's
retirement
system
under
the
state
educational
system,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
how
do
you
--
how
could
you
justify
that
on
the
basis
of
them
having
no
connection
with
the
public
school
system?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
it's
a
segment
of
--
it's
a
segment
of
the
school
system.
no
one
can
get
into
that
system
except
the
school
teacher.
chief
justice
earl
warren
certainly
you
know
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that's
what
we're
talking
about
and
that's
all
i'm
talking
about.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
any
other
part
--
in
any
other
part
of
virginia
can
any
school
teacher
in
the
private
school
get
into
your
public
retirement
system?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
can?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
what
manner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
sure
that
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
wish
you
would.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
we'll
recess
now.
