mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
joins
the
petitioners
in
urging
that
the
judgment
below
in
this
case
be
reversed
and
that
the
case
be
sent
back
with
instructions
to
grant
relief
necessary
to
bring
about
a
reopening
of
the
public
schools
in
prince
edward
county.
i
shall
argue
the
case
in
somewhat
technical
terms
introduced
by
the
respondents,
but
not
because
that
is
the
whole
case,
but
because
it
seems
to
me
important
to
show
that
even
on
their
own
ground,
their
arguments
when
closely
examined,
are
lacking
in
the
merits.
the
court
will
not
forget,
i'm
sure,
even
though
i
don't
mention
it
again,
that
this
case
is
ultimately
concerned
with
probably
the
greatest
of
injustices,
the
denial
of
--
and
equal
education
to
children
because
of
racial
considerations.
now
as
we
see
it,
the
case
has
two,
somewhat
different
parts.
the
first
concerns
the
situation
that
obtained
while
the
tax
credits,
the
scholarships,
and
the
tuition
grants
were
enforced.
and
it
seems
quite
clear
that
with
the
public
schools
in
the
county
closed,
now
i
don't
go
beyond
it,
that
with
the
public
schools
in
the
county
closed
and
public
schools
being
operated
by
the
state
in
every
other
county,
that
the
main
--
that
the
contribution
of
state
funds
to
this
white
foundation
school
is
clearly
within
cooper
and
aaron,
and
that
there's
nothing
more
to
that
issue.
the
more
difficult
part
of
the
case,
although
i
think
not
difficult
when
one
analyzes
it
clearly,
is
when
one
creates
it
on
the
supposition
that
there
is
no
financial
aid
being
given
to
the
children
or
through
them
to
the
foundation
school.
as
we
see
it,
this
branch
of
the
case
rests
upon
a
very
simple
theory
that
if
you
keep
it
clearly
in
mind
dissolves
all
the
complexities
that
have
been
so
much
argued
about.
the
schools
of
prince
edward
county
have
been
closed
solely
because
of
the
policy
of
denying
the
children
who
live
in
that
county,
any
public
education
rather
than
giving
them
an
equal
public
education
as
required
by
this
court's
mandate.
and
we
submit
that
for
officials
exercising
state
power
to
deny
children
who
live
in
prince
edward
county
any
public
education,
upon
such
a
grant,
while
granting
it
to
all
other
children
in
the
state,
constitutes
an
invidious
discrimination,
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
between
children
who
live
in
prince
edward
county
and
children
who
live
outside.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
plan
to
devote
my
whole
argument
to
this
point
and
i
think
the
difference
is
that
i
say
between
the
case
you
suggest
and
this
case
will
come
out
in
course
of
it.
i
will
develop,
mr.
justice
stewart,
at
some
length
two
points.
first,
that
here
the
only
ground
suggested
for
the
differentiation
is
the
purpose
to
perpetuate
inequality
in
educational
opportunities.
and
second,
that
assuming
one
could
go
behind
that,
or
that
that
was
irrelevant,
that
in
this
case
there
is
suggested
and
cannot
be
presumed
to
be
any
differences
in
local
conditions
or
local
needs
such
as
would
justify
some
of
the
exercises
of
local
options
that
have
been
suggested
in
the
opinions
below
and
here.
i'm
going
to
develop
that
as
we
go
along,
but
those
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
two
essential
points
in
discussing
local
option.
in
the
--
i'm
going
to
devote
my
whole
argument
except
that
i
would
hope
until
the
time
at
the
end
to
this
basic
thesis.
in
developing
it,
i
start
with
the
indisputable
fact
that
the
net
effect
of
respondent's
activities
is
an
unconstitutional
kind
of
discrimination
against
the
children
of
prince
edward
county,
in
favor
of
the
children
who
live
everywhere
else.
prince
edward
county
children
have
no
less
need
for
a
basic
education.
there's
no
suggestion
that
they
are
less
educatable.
the
sole
ground
for
the
differentiation
is
the
desire
to
avoid
having
them
--
having
white
children
in
the
county,
go
to
the
same
school
as
negroes.
now
it
manifest
--
mr.
archibald
cox
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes.
yes.
i'm
sorry.
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
there
are
local
options
and
local
options
and
the
fact
that
this
local
option,
if
it
may
be
called
that,
is
impermissible,
does
not
require
one
to
say
that
all
local
options
are
impermissible
and
i
was
afraid
that
i'd
let,
your
honor,
to
think
i
was
taking
the
opposite.
it
depends
on
the
local
option,
that
is
what
i'm
getting
and
trying
to
say.
to
manifest
the
purpose
of
the
basis
of
classification
here
is
not
acceptable
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
that
point
was
squarely
decided
in
james
and
almond,
a
three-judge
court
decision
that
was
cited
by
approval
in
this
court
in
cooper
and
aaron.
and
indeed,
the
respondents
could
see
that
point,
that
if
virginia
had
introduced
this
differentiation,
and
by
virginia,
i
now
mean
the
statewide
officials,
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
the
whole
debate
here
therefore,
is
whether
the
respondents,
by
the
procedure
that
they
have
followed,
can
escape
responsibility
for
what
would
otherwise
have
been
a
patently
unconstitutional
result.
now
manifestly,
anybody
pressing
such
a
proposition
is
that
has
a
very
heavy
burden
to
carry.
first,
i
suggest
that
it's
plain
that
the
discrimination
between
these
two
groups
of
children,
regardless
of
race,
is
not
saved
by
the
fact
that
the
victims
live
in
one
county
and
those,
with
whom
they
are
being
compared,
live
in
other
counties.
while
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
require
territorial
uniformity,
nevertheless,
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
leaves
a
lot
of
room
for
territorial
variations
in
the
law,
still,
the
bear
fact
that
a
discrimination
conforms
to
county
line,
is
not
enough
to
make
it
rational
and
within
the
equal
protection
clause.
that's
the
point
of
of
course
in
baker
and
carr
and
grand
sanders
and
that's
the
point
that's
been
assumed,
repeatedly,
in
decisions
of
this
court,
examining
laws
that
vary
differently
on
people
in
different
localities.
again,
nobody
really
questions
the
fact,
as
the
court
below
said,
“no
one
questions
the
principle
that
if
virginia
is
operating
a
statewide
centralized
system
of
schools,
she
may
not
close
their
schools
in
prince
edward
county
in
the
face
of
a
desegregation
order,
while
she
continues
to
operate
the
schools
in
the
other
counties.”
here
respondent's
argument
is
that
this
discrimination
which
would
be
admittedly
unconstitutional
if
the
legislature
did
it
is
saved
in
this
instance
because
it's
accomplished
by
what
they
call
local
option.
now
it
might
be
enough
to
say
that
that
contention
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
all
the
precedents.
on
at
least
two,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
three
occasions,
the
court
has
held
that
in
making
territorial
variations
in
the
treatment
of
citizens,
the
legislature
has
all
the
--
has
the
power
to
do
everything
that
could
be
done
by
local
option.
as
a
matter
of
logic
it
follows,
that
what
the
legislature
can't
do,
can't
be
done
by
local
option
and
so,
under
those
precedents,
the
contention
that
respondents
make
is
contrary
to
the
views
of
this
court.
now
it's
not
necessary
for
us
to
go
so
far
as
to
urge
that
expression
of
local
preference
will
never
save
a
classification
that
would
be
unconstitutional
if
made
by
the
legislator.
it's
enough
for
us
to
show,
i
submit,
first
that
the
mere
fact
of
local
option
does
not
automatically
take
a
differentiation
out
from
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
and
second,
that
the
expression
of
local
preference
will
not
save
this
classification,
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
in
other
words,
that
the
court
below
erred
in
supposing
that
because
some
local
options
were
constitutional,
therefore,
all
local
options
must
be
constitutional,
which
does
not
follow.
plainly
the
local
option
does
not
automatically
render
the
equal
protection
clause
inapplicable.
there's
no
magic
in
the
words
local
option.
what
the
introduction
of
local
option
does
is
two
things.
first,
it
fragments
the
power
decision
making
processes
of
the
state
among
a
variety
officials,
some
local,
and
some
statewide
and
second,
it
provides
for
a
referendum
or
other
expression
of
local
opinion.
let's
see
if
either
of
those
renders
the
equal
protection
clause
inapplicable.
the
fragmentation
of
state
power,
among
statewide
officials
and
officials
with
only
countywide
jurisdiction
is
patently
irrelevant.
respondent's,
if
i
understand
them
say
here,
that
the
officials
in
the
county
aren't
discriminating,
the
supervisors
aren't
discriminating
because
they
voted
that
no
child
shall
have
a
public
education
and
their
authority
is
only
countywide.
now
the
school
board
says
that,
it
also
says
“we're
helpless.
we're
dependent
upon
the
supervisors.”
and
the
state
officials
say,
“we
aren't
discriminating
because
we're
offering
the
same
thing
to
every
county.”
and
that's
the
ground
chiefly
on
which
the
court
below
rested,
but
that,
i
submit,
is
contrary
to
the
decisions
of
this
court,
and
indeed,
i
think
i
can
say,
patently
fallacious.
the
fallacy
is
that
the
act
of
several
officials,
including
county
officials,
cannot
be
viewed
one
at
a
time
in
isolation.
every
respondent
here,
and
this
goes
for
the
county
supervisors,
is
exercising
or
purporting
to
exercise,
the
power
and
authority
of
virginia.
every
one
of
them
is
acting
as
and
for
the
state
so
far
as
the
purposes
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
concerned.
that's
been
true
all
the
way
from
virginia
and
reeves
to
cooper
against
aaron,
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
concerned
with
the
net
effect
of
the
exercise
of
state
power
and
not
with
who
doesn't
or
with
what
particular
officials
doing.
that
principle
is
illustrated,
perhaps,
best
by
the
cases
based
which
involve
a
converse
situation
by
the
cases
involving
challenges
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
complaining
that
the
power
has
been
exercised
by
the
wrong
instrumentality.
and
in
an
early
case
of
missouri
against
dockery,
mr.
justice
holmes
said
for
the
court,
“rights
under
that
amendment
turn
on
the
power
of
the
state,
no
matter
by
what
organ
it
acts,
it
is
a
question
of
the
power
of
the
state,
as
a
whole,”
and
so
in
the
converse
situation
it's
the
question
of
the
power
of
the
state
as
a
whole
and
what
its
impact
is
in
creating
an
unjust
discrimination,
not
who
does
it?
the
principle
is
quite
clearly
illustrated
by
a
case
which
unfortunately
is
not
cited
in
our
briefs.
iowa-des
moines
bank
against
bennett
in
two
--
iowa-des
moines
bank
against
bennett
in
284
u.s.
at
239.
in
that
case,
a
national
bank
was
contending
that
it
had
been
subjected
to
discriminatory
taxation,
not
in
this
case
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
in
violation
of
a
federal
statute
that
permitted
the
capital
of
national
banks
to
be
taxed
equally
with
the
capital
of
other
monied
institution.
and
the
claim
was,
on
the
part
of
the
bank,
that
they
were
subjected
to
a
higher
rate
of
taxation,
or
that
their
capital
had
been
over
valued.
the
answer
that
the
state
made
was
that,
“our
statutes
don't
require
this.”
the
board
of
the
assessors
made
an
equal
assessment
upon
the
federal
bank
and
the
other
monied
institutions,
but
that
any
higher
rate
being
paid
by
the
federal
bank
is
the
result
of
a
mistake
made
by
the
county
treasurer,
i
think
it
was,
or
perhaps
it
was
the
tax
collector.
and
justice
brandeis
speaking
for
a
unanimous
court,
if
my
memory
is
right,
brushed
that
aside
and
said
its
a
question
of
the
power
of
the
state
as
a
whole,
and
that
for
the
purposes
of
determining
whether
there
was
discrimination.
the
powers
of
the
several
state
officials
must
be
treated
as
if
merged
into
a
single
officer
and
that's
exactly
the
contention
we
made
here.
and
under
that
principle,
if
one
took
the
concession
literally,
since
they
must
be
treated
as
if
they
were
a
single
officer
and
since
everybody
has
agreed
through
this
litigation
that
the
discrimination
among
children
based
on
where
they
live,
would
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
if
accomplished
by
a
single
statewide
officer.
it
follows
that
the
judgment
below
was
wrong.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
i
would
think
that
it
was
--
i
think
two
things
although
it's
been
hard
for
me
to
find
an
exact
case.
i
would
suppose
that
the
normal
rules
of
vicarious
liability
were
enough
to
charge
the
state
officials,
the
board
of
supervisors,
and
this
essentially
are
state
officials,
with
knowledge
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
rest
of
the
state.
but,
we're
in
equity
here,
even
if
they
didn't
know
about
it
at
the
time
they
acted
and
they
know
about
it
today
and
surely
they
can't
blind
their
eyes
to
it
under
the
present
circumstances.
i
turn
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
so
called
constitutional
minimum
funds.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
for
the
maintenance
of
the
building.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
their
school
buildings.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
except
that
they
aren't
offering
education
to
children
in
a
way
they
are
in
the
other
part
of
the
state.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
take
it
your
suggestion
is
that
the
state,
even
if
one
discussed
this
case
in
terms
of
local
option,
the
state
retains
a
close
connection
with
them.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
that's
true,
and
i
rely
on
that
fact.
there
are
many
ways,
in
which,
the
state
retains
a
close
connection,
the
approval
of
teachers,
the
prescription
of
what
the
school
book
should
be,
the
local
superintendent
of
schools
must
come
for
an
approved
list
and
so
on.
but
i've
been,
as
i
said
in
the
beginning,
i've
been
anxious
to
take
this
case
just
in
the
terms
in
which
they
put
it
and
to
show
that
even
then,
there
is
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
so,
while
of
course,
we
rely
on
that
if
necessary,
i
think
even
if
those
elements
weren't
there,
the
result
would
have
to
be
the
same.
now,
i
mentioned
that
there
were
two
elements
introduced
by
local
option,
one
was
this
fragmentation
of
authority.
the
other
is
--
that
per
se
not
here
a
local
referendum
but
an
expression
of
local
opinion
through
elected
officials
which
i
will
assume
is
the
same
for
present
purposes.
but
i
submit
that
it's
clear
that
that
cap,
automatically
take
the
case
out
from
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
here,
i
think,
was
the
fundamental
error
in
the
opinion
below.
the
court
said,
since
every
locality
may
participate,
if
it
wishes
to
do
so
and
state
funds
are
available
to
each
upon
the
same
conditions.
the
state
is
even
handed.
well,
i've
already
mentioned
that
the
locality
is
the
state,
as
one
error
in
that,
but
more
than
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
isn't
concerned
with
the
equality
of
treatment
among
localities,
it's
concerned
with
the
equality
treatment
among
people.
these
are
personal
rights
and
they
are
personal
rights,
which
it
has
been
held
many
times,
cannot
be
waived
by
majority
vote,
not
even
by
the
will
of
the
majority
of
the
class
affected.
so
that
the
referendum
doesn't
destroy
the
individuals
right,
whether
a
white
or
colored
child
in
prince
edward
county,
to
equality
before
the
state
with
other
children
in
virginia.
so
that
the
local
option,
i
submit,
does
not
automatically
take
this
case
out
from
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
then
the
question
becomes
is
the
denial
of
public
schooling
to
prince
edward
children
while
giving
it
to
other
children
an
invidious
or
otherwise
arbitrary
classification
and
i
point
out
to
begin
with
that
so
far
as
anything
in
the
record
shows,
conditions
in
prince
edward
county
and
children
in
prince
edward
county
are
just
like
other
children
in
respect
to
the
fundamental
need
for
an
education.
and
so,
we
say,
that
even
if
it
would
be
assumed
that
there
are
times
when
the
preference
of
the
people
in
a
particular
locality,
will
save
a
classification
based
on
residence,
a
lack
of
territorial
uniformity
in
the
law,
still
that
the
local
preference
will
not
save
the
classification
here
for
two
independently
sufficient
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
this
classification
differentiating
between
people,
between
children,
who
are
apparently
similarly
situated
in
every
relevant
respect
is
itself
too
invidious,
to
furnish
a
justification
for
the
differentiation.
the
schools
were
closed
and
this
is
beyond
dispute
because
of
the
recitals
of
the
school
--
of
the
board
of
supervisors,
and
i
don't
think
they
deny
it
or
have
any
desire
to
slide
away
from
it,
the
schools
were
closed,
solely
to
avoid
giving
negro
children
an
equal
public
education
as
this
court
has
defined
it
with
white
children.
only
in
the
abolition
of
segregated
education
can
negro
children
receive
true
equality.
surely,
the
desire
to
perpetuate
one
invidious
discrimination,
one
inequality
based
on
race,
will
not
justify
introducing
another
inequality,
although
that
one
is
not
based
upon
race,
it
is
still
an
inequality
and
that,
i
submit,
is
the
end
of
the
case
here
we
have
so
far
as
the
substance
goes.
here,
we
have
a
classification,
different
treatment
by
the
state
of
people
who
in
all
respect
are
apparently
alike,
and
the
reason
for
it
is
so
unworthy
as
the
motive
in
this
case
and
it
just
won't
serve
to
justify
and
to
rationalize
the
classification.
the
state
is
not
treating
people
differently
in
pursuit
of
a
rational
policy.
now,
i
would
emphasize
that
this,
that
what
i
have
said
is
not
inconsistent
in
any
respect
with
the
cases
cited
by
the
respondents
which
they
argue,
support
the
proposition
that
motive
will
not
vitiate
an
otherwise
constitutional
act.
nut
the
cases
that
they
cite,
typically,
deal
with
use
of
the
commerce
power
and
the
claim
was
made
that
what
congress
was
interested
in
was
not
regulating
commerce
but
accomplishing
some
moral
objective
as
in
lottery
ticket
or
that
in
the
child
labor
tax
case,
that
the
purpose
was
to
eliminate
child
labor,
not
to
raise
money.
those
cases
are
different
and
we
would
fully
concede
that
the
use
of
a
power
to
achieve
was
not
--
is
not
vitiated
by
achieving
some
collateral
objective,
but
here
the
question
is
whether
you
--
by
a
classification,
which
is
at
first
blunt,
arbitrary
and
unreasonable,
there
is
something
--
some
policy
the
state
is
trying
to
achieve
that
justifies
the
classification
that
makes
it
rational
and
here,
the
state
has
excluded
all
other
hypothesis
by
saying
what
their
purpose
is
and
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
the
purpose
to
perpetuate
one
inequality
of
a
character
that
the
constitution
condemns
certainly
won't
justify
introducing
another
inequality.
nor
is
this
in
anyway
inconsistent
with
the
possibility,
and
i
state
only
with
the
possibility
but
i
assume
it
for
this
case,
with
the
possibility
that
a
state
might
be
able
to
abandon
all
public
education.
then
there
would
be
no
question,
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
if
it
genuinely
abandoned,
but
here
we
are
concerned
with
the
equal
protection
clause,
and
the
schools
are
operating
in
other
parts
of
the
state.
now,
i
go
a
step
further.
i
assume
now,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
the
supervisors
are
not
bound
by
their
own
resolutions
or
that
their
motive
is
irrelevant.
still,
we
submit
that
this
discrimination
cannot
be
saved
by
any
expression
of
opinion
under
local
option
because
education
is
a
subject,
in
relation
to
which,
because
education
is
subject
in
relation
to
which
the
discrimination
occurs
is
too
important,
and
its
importance
too
far
transcends
county
lines
to
deny
some
children
the
opportunity
for
some
education
while
granting
it
to
others
unless
some
very
strong
justification
appeared.
here
--
that
my
time
is
running
terribly
rapidly,
i
--
here,
let
me
simply
say
briefly,
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
one
can
presume
that
there
are
any
differences
in
territorial
or
local
conditions
that
would
justify
this
discrimination
in
the
cases
of
juvenile
detention
homes,
and
the
like,
they're
obviously
are.
here,
it
is
not
suggested
that
the
schools
compete
with
other
needs
of
the
county,
for
the
tax
dollars
available,
nor
can
it
be
said
that
education
is
such
a
local
matter,
that
the
people
--
just
because
they
want
it
that
way,
can
give
it
to
children
--
they
give
it
to
their
children
or
not.
that
maybe
true
of
speed
loss
or
whether
you'll
have
race
tracks
in
the
town
or
whiskey
as
the
like,
as
justice
holmes
once
said,
those
matters
are
wholly
within
the
power
of
the
state.
education
is
too
fundamental,
too
important,
and
i
emphasize
that
it
transcends
county
lines.
if
children
lose
three
years
of
education,
their
lives
will
be
affected
by
that,
where
ever
they
go
or
what
ever
they
do.
and
if
this
experiment
in
ignorance
is
continued
in
prince
edward
county,
it
will
affect
the
whole
state
and
not
just
conditions
in
that
county.
now,
taking
it
as
established,
i
hurry
on,
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
because
of
this
discrimination
between
children
in
prince
edward
county
and
all
other
children
in
virginia
then
it
seems
to
us
to
follow
that
the
decree
must
bar
the
continuance
of
that
unconstitutional
state
of
action.
the
decree
should
require
the
defendants
so
long
as
virginia
furnishes
public
education
elsewhere
to
take
the
steps
necessary
to
furnish
it
to
children
in
prince
edward
county.
the
thrust
of
such
a
decree
is
plainly
negative.
it
would
enjoin
an
unconstitutional
course
of
conduct
and
on
direct
parties
persons
purporting
to
exercise
state
authority
in
order
to
carry
on
an
unconstitutional
course
of
conduct
may
be
enjoined.
under
some
circumstances,
it
might
be
possible
simply
to
stop
there
and
it's
to
be
presumed
that
respondents,
especially
those
who
have
taken
an
oath
of
office,
will
carry
out
their
duties
when
they're
laid
down
clearly,
certainly
by
this
court.
here,
so
much
time
has
passed
that
we
join
in
urging
that
more
specific
steps
be
spelled
out
in
the
court's
amendment.
we
think
the
supervisors
should
be
ordered
to
levy
the
taxes
necessary
to
provide
some
basic
education
in
prince
edward
county
that
the
board
of
education
should
be
required
to
open
the
schools
and
to
submit
a
plan
for
the
desegregation
of
the
schools
and
that
the
state
officials
should
be
enjoined
from
continuing
the
discrimination.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
not,
your
honor
for
two
reasons.
so
far
as
the
county
officials
are
concerned,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
eleventh
amendment
is
rendered
inapplicable
by
the
fact
that
they
are
county
officials
and
the
counties
enjoined
--
enjoy
none
of
the
immunity
that
the
state
would
enjoy.
now,
my
friends
from
virginia
say
that
that
applies
only
where
there
is
a
debt
involved.
the
two
answers
to
that,
one
that
most
clearly
is
not
the
ground
on
which
this
court's
decision
rests.
second,
there
are
a
number
of
cases
including
hopkins
against
clemson
college,
where
the
cause
of
action
against
county
was
not
based
on
the
debt,
that
was
the
case
involving
trespass.
i
--
in
--
might
i
take
just
a
few
minutes
in
view
of
the
importance
of
the
case?
mr.
archibald
cox
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
a
second
illustration
in
this
court
is
board
of
commissioners
against
united
states,
100
f.2d
929,
which
as
modified
in
the
minor
respect
was
affirmed
in
308
u.s.
343,
which
was
a
suit
by
an
indian
to
recover
back
taxes.
the
united
states
was
not
the
real
plaintiff
and
nothing
turned
on
the
fact
that
the
suit
was
brought
in
the
name
of
the
united
states.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
by
interpretation,
it
has
been
taken
to
apply
by
citizens
of
the
same
state.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
that
event,
i
suggest
the
doctrine
doesn't
apply
for
the
reason
i
have
stated.
the
two
have
been
equated
quite
frequently,
mr.
justice.
i
think
hummel
and
louisiana
are
some
such
names
in
this
first
case.
so
we
say
that
in
terms
of
the
counties
acts
--
count
--
the
county
supervisor's
action,
this
defense
simply
doesn't
apply,
but
i
think
there's
another
and
more
fundamental
answer
to
any
argument
based
on
the
eleventh
amendment
or
sovereign
immunity,
and
that
is,
that
you
can't
pick
the
decree
apart
and
look
at
it
bit
by
bit.
the
remedies
that
are
proposed
here
are
in
their
thrust,
negative.
their
aim
as
a
whole
at
compelling
the
cessation
of
this
course
of
conduct.
that
truly
suggests
that
the
county
supervisors
should
be
required
to
levy
the
tax.
strictly
speaking,
i
take
it
that
if
virginia
were
disposed
to
give
up
her
entire
public
school
system
then
the
theory
we've
advanced
here
would
make
it
proper
to
release
the
board
of
supervisors
from
that
obligation,
but
surely
the
court
in
framing
the
details
of
its
decree,
vis-a-via
the
supervisors,
is
entitled
to
presume
that
virginia
is
going
to
continue
doing
what
it's
done
all
along,
do
its
part
to
provide
public
schools
for
the
children
of
virginia.
and
if
that
is
a
false
assumption
and
if
virginia
comes
in
and
says,
“we're
planning
to
close
our
entire
school
system
despite
the
provisions
of
our
constitution,
requiring
the
legislature
to
operate
and
maintain
a
system
of
schools
throughout
the
state,”
then
will
be
time
enough
to
think
about
modifying
the
decree.
for
the
present
as
i
say,
the
relief
we
suggest,
seems
to
us,
to
be
essentially
negative,
essentially
directed
at
terminating
an
unconstitutional
course
of
conduct.
mr.
archibald
cox
send
it
back
to
lower
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
would
(voice
overlap)
i
think
that
they
--
does
not
require
a
three-judge
court
and
i
was
just
coming
to
that.
i
do
want
to
say,
if
i
may
say
one
sentence
first,
of
course
mandamus
to
compel
the
levying
of
taxes
is
sustained
by
a
number
of
decisions
cited
in
our
brief.
now,
the
reason
we
think
that
a
three-judge
court
is
not
required,
the
reasons
are
two-fold.
in
the
first
place,
the
relief
sought
is
not
to
restrain
in
the
language
of
the
federal
statute,
the
enforcement
or
execution
of
a
state
statute.
the
attack
is
upon
the
executive
or
administrative
action
and
the
action
which
the
respondents
have
chosen
to
embark
upon,
not
upon
anything
required
by
the
state
law.
and
the
decision
of
this
court
in
ex
parte
bransford,
310
u.s.
354,
310
u.s
354,
especially
at
359,
deals
with
that
very
point
if
i
may
read
just
a
sentence.
there
the
challenge
was
that
certain
state
taxation
was
discriminatory
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
the
state
statute
didn't
require
the
discrimination.
it
resulted
from
the
act
of
minor
state
officials
and
the
court
said,
“variations
by
assessors
in
valuations
of
like
property,
taxable
under
the
same
statute,
sufficiently
marked
to
be
discriminatory
under
the
constitution
for
valuations
so
large
as
to
be
confiscatory
cannot
properly
be
said
to
be
the
basis
for
an
attack
on
the
ground
of
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute.
such
assessments,
if
made
and
if
invalid,
are
so
because
of
a
wrong
done
by
officers
under
the
statute
rather
than
because
of
the
requirement
of
the
statute
itself”
and
i
submit
that
that
is
an
exact
description.
mr.
archibald
cox
ex
parte
bransford,
310
u.s.
354.
i'm
sorry
it's
not
in
our
brief
because
we
didn't
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
the
court
wishes
in
memorandum,
we'd
be
happy
to
supply
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
certainly,
will.
mr.
archibald
cox
then
i
won't
mention
the
other
case
and
our
second
argument
upon
this
point
would
be
--
would
be
this,
that
a
case
primarily
against
local
officials
on
a
matter
that
is
of
immediate
local
concern,
which
the
decree
will
not
have
a
statewide
impact
of
any
significance
it's
not
a
case
that
requires
a
three-judge
court.
i'll
supply
the
citations
to
support
that
statement.
there
are
a
number
of
such
cases.
there
is
one
last
point.
it
is
argued
here
that
the
state
officials
have
done
nothing
wrong
and
that
the
county
school
authorities
have
done
nothing
wrong,
that
each
of
their
acts
depends
upon
an
act
by
somebody
else,
and
that
therefore,
no
relief
can
be
granted
against
them.
that
point
is
squarely
covered
by
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
the
case
of
labette
county
commissioners
versus
united
states
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
labette
county
commissioners
against
united
states,
112
u.s.
217,
224,
225.
i
won't
read
it
in
view
of
the
time
that
has
been
taken.
for
those
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
should
be
reversed
and
the
case
go
back
with
the
instructions
i've
suggested.
