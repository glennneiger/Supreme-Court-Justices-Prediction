what
year
was
that?
justice
potter
stewart
1957.
justice
potter
stewart
was
this
grant
also
available
for
use
in
a
public
school
outside
of
the
county?
justice
potter
stewart
and
within
--
of
course,
they
weren't
but
this
time
they
were
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
who
organized
that?
justice
potter
stewart
grants
and
aid
would
have
been
available
to
negro
children,
would
they
to
attend
public
schools
outside
the
county?
justice
potter
stewart
state
superintendent
of
public
instruction?
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
school
in
operation?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
the
foundation.
how's
it
being
financed?
justice
potter
stewart
through
any
state
funds.
justice

(voice

justice
potter
stewart
and
what's
--
now
as
a
matter
of
fact,
happening
with
respect
to
negroes?
justice
potter
stewart
this
past
year.
justice
potter
stewart
how
was
that
being
finances
in
the
county?
justice
potter
stewart
in
–-
justice
potter
stewart
in
terms
of
the
numbers
laid
here,
i
think
you
said
there
were
some
1,300
of
white
school
children
in
the
county?
justice
potter
stewart
i
gather
that
the
tax
credit
may
now
be
out
of
the
case?
you
say
that
it's
been
repealed?
justice
potter
stewart
the
tax
credit,
the
25%
tax
credit.
justice
potter
stewart
that
law
has
been
repealed,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
carter
about
this
hypothetical
case,
let's
assume
the
state
which
has
been
in
the
conventional
business
of
providing
education
to
a
public
schools
decided,
“we're
going
to
do
this
differently
from
now
on.
we're
going
to
abandon
our
public
school
and
instead
of
that,
we're
going
to
provide
$300
a
year
for
every
child
of
school
age
who
wants
to
go
to
school.
all
he
has
to
show
is
that
he
has
gone
to
a
school
of
his
choice,
a
public
school
outside
of
the
state
or
a
private
school
in
or
outside
of
the
state.
we're
going
to
do
this
uniformly
and
give
each
school
child
in
our
state
their
complete
freedom,
he
and
his
parents
will
have
complete
freedom
to
be
educated
any
way
he
wants
to,
of
the
public
expense
up
to
$300.
justice
potter
stewart
let's
say
$1,500.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i'm
assuming
--
i'm
assuming
that
the
individual
child
and
his
parents,
if
they
want
to,
they
can
go
to
an
all
white
school,
to
an
all
negro
school,
to
an
integrated
school
or
to
any
kind
of
school
they
want
to
and
all
the
--
and
that
the
only
control
the
state
puts
on
it
is
that
the
school
maintain
minimal
educational
standards.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
intellectual.
justice
potter
stewart
what
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
what
other
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
--
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
understand
under
my
hypothetical
case,
the
money
goes
to
the
child
or
to
the
child's
parents.
justice
potter
stewart
eventually
goes
to
the
school.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
my
case
almost
exactly
like
the
--
what
was
provided
for
in
the
g.i.
bill
of
rights,
by
the
federal
government?
justice
potter
stewart
but
how
far
would
that
doctrine
go?
does
this
mean
that
everybody
who
receives
any
kind
of
government
funds
whether
in
the
form
of
unemployment
insurance
or
relief
payments
or
anything
else,
isn't
allowed
to
discriminate
on
a
racial
basis,
in
any
aspect
of
his
life?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose,
on
this
branch
of
the
argument,
it
doesn't
--
it's
not
important
that
there
be
racial
discrimination
and
it's
not
really
vital
that
this
be
related
to
schools.
i
suppose
this
argument
could
be
made
if
virginia,
through
the
cooperation
of
its
state
and
local
officials,
provided
highways
in
all
of
the
counties,
but
one
that
did
not
provide
it
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not
talking
now
though
basically
about
racial
discrimination,
but
rather
discrimination
against
all
the
school
children
of
prince
edward
county?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
that's
what
i'm
asking.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
feel
it's
necessary
at
all
to
prove
any
knowing
concert
of
action
among
these
various
officials?
justice
potter
stewart
i'd
better
go
back
and
read
the
eleventh
amendment,
i
guess,
but
this
people
are
citizens
of
virginia,
aren't
they?
the
eleventh
amendment
applies
for
suits
against
the
states
by
citizens
of
another
state,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
sovereign
immunity,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
would
you
have
us
enter
such
a
decree
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
send
it
back
to
the
three-judge
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
understand
the
point
you're
making.
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
me
that
your
plan
has
completely
deprived
people
of
the
privilege
of
going
to
an
integrated
public
school
in
prince
edward
county
which
is
what
everybody
else
in
the
united
states
is
required
to
do
under
the
constitution
and
certainly
has
the
option
of
doing
it.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
talking
about
the
foundation?
justice
potter
stewart
does
anybody
there
have
the
liberty
to
go
to
a
public
school
in
the
county?
justice
potter
stewart
does
any
school
child
in
prince
edward
county
have
the
liberty
to
go
to
a
public
school
in
prince
edward
county?
justice
potter
stewart
any
public
school.
justice
potter
stewart
by
definition.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
understand
mr.
gravatt
if
there's
any
claim
to
the
contrary
by
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
(voice
overlap)
right
about
that.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
are
surely
--
you're
not
suggesting
what
you
seem
to
be
saying
a
moment
ago
that
a
law
is
automatically
constitutionally
valid
if
it's
enacted
by
majority
vote
of
the
locality?
justice
potter
stewart
now
the
state
aid
is
on
a
matching
dollar
per
dollar
basis?
justice
potter
stewart
except
to
the
so-called
constitutional
minimum
of
something
like
$40,000
in
this
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
available
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
point
i
suppose
mr.
mcilwaine
is
that
a
county
is
not
constitutionally
required
to
have
a
sheriff
at
all.
