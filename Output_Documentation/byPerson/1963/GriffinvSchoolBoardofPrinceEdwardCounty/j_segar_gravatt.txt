mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
i
would
like
at
the
outset
of
the
argument
of
this
case,
sir,
to
see
if
we
can
agree
on
a
few
very
simple
and
i
think
well-established
principles.
the
first
is
that
this
is
a
suit
to
redress
deprivation
of
rights
secured
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
upon
that
fact
depends
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
read
the
brief
of
the
petitioners
and
ascertain
what
is
the
right
that
they
claim
that
they
have
been
deprived
of.
it
is
stated
in
oral
argument
that
the
right
is
a
right
to
equal
educational
opportunities.
that
statement
is
contained
in
the
brief.
in
order
to
find
out
what
are
the
constitutional
rights
that
they
have,
it
is
necessary
first
for
us
to
determine
what
this
court
decided
in
brown
against
board
of
education.
as
i
understand
the
opinion,
as
it
has
been
construed
by
all
of
the
lower
federal
courts,
the
opinion
was
an
enlargement
of
the
liberty
of
people
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
in
that,
it
removed
race
as
a
consideration
with
respect
to
the
access
to
and
the
use
of
public
facilities,
namely,
public
schools.
now,
if
that
be
a
correct
interpretation,
that
cannot
be
enlarged
into
a
decree
or
a
judgment
that
virginia
is
compelled
to
operate
public
schools
nor
that
any
person
is
required
to
attend
the
public
school
or
that
the
power
of
the
state
of
virginia
to
control
and
to
modify,
and
to
alter
the
methods
and
the
means
by
which
it
provides
education,
is
in
any
way
is
impaired
by
that
decision.
i
take
it
further
that
there
will
be
no
disagreement
with
the
proposition
which
has
been
repeatedly
mentioned
in
the
more
--
most
recent
decisions
of
this
court
that
education
is
in
fact
an
area
that
is
reserved
to
the
states
or
to
the
people
under
the
tenth
amendment,
and
that
the
states
have
the
power
and
the
complete
power,
and
the
whole
control
of
education,
subject
of
course
to
the
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
any
other
applicable
requirements
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
now,
what
virginia
has
done
is
not
to
abolish
education.
what
virginia
has
done
is
that
the
constitution
of
virginia,
the
arrangement
about
education
is
fixed
in
its
constitution,
has
been
there
since
1902.
this
is
no
new
innovation,
no
new
power
that
has
been
reposed
in
local
bodies,
as
a
response
to
the
decision
in
brown
against
board
of
education.
this
is
a
power
that
all
of
the
debates
was
fixed
in
the
constitution
of
virginia,
predicated
upon
a
principle
which
i
suppose
all
of
us
must
recognize
and
that
is
that
the
success
of
any
public
educational
enterprise
depends
upon
the
support
and
the
sympathy
of
those
who
must
furnish
the
funds
and
who
must
patronize
it.
and
it's
upon
that
proposition
that
virginia,
when
it
embarked
upon
the
course
of
fixing
the
public
educational
system,
reposed
in
the
local
government
body
of
each
county
and
city
the
power
to
determine
whether
or
not
and
how
much
it
would
appropriate
for
that
purpose
and
reposed
the
administration
and
the
operation
of
those
schools
in
a
local
school
board.
all
that
the
state
has
done
on
the
state
level
is
to
fix
a
plan,
the
outline
of
a
probe
by
which
the
localities,
if
they
chose
to
do
it,
could
provide
public
education
for
their
citizens
and
that
has
been
the
law
in
virginia
since
the
year
1902
under
the
present
constitution.
now,
in
1956,
the
constitution
of
virginia
was
amended,
so
as
to
permit
the
state
and
the
localities
to
use
public
funds
for
the
education
of
children
in
private
non-sectarian
schools
located
anywhere
in
the
united
states,
and
in
public
schools
located
outside
of
the
community
in
which
the
child
resides.
now,
the
statement
is
made
that
prince
edward
has
acted
in
this
case,
to
mean
racial
motives.
that
it
has
acted
to
deny
any
education.
i
would
not
void
the
fact,
which
you
find
stated
in
the
brief
that
i
have
filed,
that
this
has
been
a
tremendous
problem
for
the
people
of
prince
edward
county
and
it
will
be
a
tremendous
problem
for
the
people
of
all
southern
communities,
and
particularly,
in
sunnyside,
virginia
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time.
there's
no
way
in
the
world
that
you
can
take
a
community
upon
which
white
and
colored
people
have
lived
upon
the
land,
in
many
instances,
have
given
homes
and
parcels
of
land.
there's
no
way
in
the
world
that
you
can
arrange
to
admit
those
people
to
public
schools
except
to
commit
them
on
--
admit
them
on
the
basis
of
race.
and
that
means
that
when
you
bring
them
into
the
public
school
system,
in
that
arrangement,
in
that
county
that
you
have
got
what
the
lower
court
says,
1,800
colored
children
and
you've
got
approximate
of
1,500
white
children.
and
while
it's
good
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
i
make
the
point,
sir,
that
this
is
a
problem
that
finds
an
origin
in
facts
among
the
people
who
live
in
the
county.
that's
the
first
point,
that
it's
not
possible
to
have
what
you
have
in
the
urban
communities
where
colored
people
and
white
people
live
in
separate
districts
and
they
have
de
facto
segregation,
and
where
they
have
it
in
great
many
other
places.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
this
problem
and
the
impact
of
this
problem
in
a
rural
community
such
as
prince
edward
county,
is
not
comparable
with
anything
that
goes
on
in
any
urban
community.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
no,
sir.
i
am
saying
that
the
purpose
of
this
plan
was
--
the
purpose
of
what
has
been
done
here
was
to
exercise
an
option
and
to
afford
all
of
the
people
of
prince
edward
county,
an
enlargement
of
their
liberty
of
choice
as
to
where
they
would
go
to
school
and
where
they
would
procure
an
education.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
that
is
correct,
sir,
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
there
is
no
other
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
there
is
no
other
statement
to
be
made
sir
and
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
no,
sir.
there
are
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
absolutely
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
the
tuition
grant
part
of
it
came
into
effect
after
brown
against
board
of
--
school
board.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
the
tuition
grant
part
came
in
to
effect
after
that
decision
in
1956,
but
it
is
--
the
purpose
of
it
is
not
a
racial
purpose.
it's
a
purpose
to
give
people
what
i
take
it,
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
gives
people,
the
privilege
of
selecting
the
school
in
which
they
put
their
children.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
well,
sir,
i
come
back.
i
say
that
there
is
nothing
in
any
decision
of
this
court
that
requires
any
county
or
city
in
virginia
to
operate
a
public
school.
that
when
we
call
the
public
school,
that
we
have
deprived
no
one
of
a
right
guaranteed
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
that
what
we
do
when
we
close
the
school
under
this
arraignment
is
that
we
alter
the
method
by
which
public
education
is
provided.
instead
of
having
children
in
a
school
building
that's
owned,
maintained
and
controlled
by
public
authority,
which
of
course,
under
decisions
of
this
court
has
to
be
integrated,
that
is
everybody
who
wants
to
go
there
has
got
a
right
to
go
there.
to
have
in
the
place
of
that
by
the
exercise
of
a
legal
power
that's
reposed
in
the
board
of
supervisors,
to
have
in
the
place
of
it
available
for
all
citizens
in
scholarship
funds
which
can
be
used
by
them
in
such
schools
as
they
choose
to
use
them
in.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
no,
sir
and
there
were
none
that
white
children
could
go
to
and
we've
tried,
the
local
people
in
the
county,
i
don't
mean
by
that
but
the
board
of
supervisors
did
anything
about
it
but
they
were
repeated
efforts
made
by
local
people
to
try
to
provide
educational
facilities.
there
was
an
organized
resistance
to
it
and
affirmed
in
complete
refusal
to
accept
the
means
that
were
offered.
this
record
shows
that
in
1960,
the
virginia
teachers
association,
i'll
call
it
organization
of
virginia
teachers
has
put
in
the
paper,
i
noticed
that
they
were
going
to
put
on
an
educational
program
in
prince
edward
county
during
the
summer
months.
we
offered
--
the
school
board
offered
to
give
them
the
school
buildings
of
the
county,
to
give
them
the
facilities
and
to
give
them
janitorial
and
upkeep
of
the
buildings
and
they
refused
to
accept
it.
at
the
present
time,
through
the
good
offices
of
my
friend,
mr.
william
vanden
heuvel
of
the
justice
department,
and
through
the
mutual
effort
of
myself
and
mr.
danny,
who
is
dead
and
gone,
and
the
governor
of
virginia
and
other
people,
we
were
able
and
[inaudible]
mr.
tucker,
we
were
able
to
induce
the
colored
children
to
at
least
go
to
school
and
we
rent
it
to
them
at
a
nominal
figure
the
finest
school
buildings
in
the
county
to
be
used
for
that
purpose.
and
i
say
to
you,
that
those
same
school
buildings
and
that
--
i
don't
say
we
could
put
on
the
same
educational
program
that's
presently
being
on,
but
we
could
offer
to
--
in
that
building,
to
those
children,
all
of
the
education
and
better
than
being
offer
--
offered
in
the
prince
edward
academy
or
in
the
prince
edward
foundation
schools
or
in
any
county
that's
anywhere
adjacent
to
prince
edward
county
and
upon
this
issue
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
well,
sir.
that
depends
upon
the
definition
of
a
public
school
and
under
the
definitions
that
have
come
down
from
your
honor,
it
would
undoubtedly
be
a
public
school.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
the
action
that
was
taken
sir
was
not
to
procreate
any
money
to
the
school
board
for
the
operation
of
public
schools.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
no,
sir.
these
schools
were
not
--
this
action
was
not
taken
until
1959,
and
that
resolution
has
got
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
with
the
board
of
supervisors
within
office
at
that
time.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
not
that
i
know
of,
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
it
is
an
integrated
pubic
school.
this
--
it
is
an
integrated
school
that's
been
operated
in
the
school
buildings,
owned
by
the
school
board
and
leased
to
a
private
corporation
known
as
the
prince
edward
preschool.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
that
is
an
integrated
student
body.
that
is
an
integrated
faculty.
that
is
an
integrated
school
in
every
sense
of
the
world.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
no,
sir.
we
not
only
--
the
board
of
supervisors
approved
everything
that
i
did
to
try
to
cooperate
in
getting
this
school
open
and
in
time
get
this
people
into
the
school
and
the
state
money
and
the
county
money
under
the
county
ordinance
would
be
available
anytime
that
these
people
would
apply
for
it,
to
pay
the
expenses
of
their
attendance
in
that
school
if
they
chose
to
make
the
application.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
in
1959,
they
simply
declared,
they
simply
decided
that
school
board
under
the
law
offers
the
board
of
supervisors
a
school
budget
with
a
request
for
an
appropriation.
the
board
of
supervisors
refused
to
make
any
appropriation
under
that
school
budget
in
1959
and
that
left
no
money
in
the
hands
of
the
school
board
with
which
to
operate
the
schools.
all
of
the
state
money
is
appropriate
on
a
matching
fund
basis
in
any
county
that
chooses
to
operate
schools,
gets
a
certain
proportion
of
state
funds.
a
county
that
does
not
choose
to
operate
schools,
and
choose
to
go
on
a
tuition
grant
program
an
approximately
commensurate
amount
of
money
is
paid
out
through
the
state
which
may
be
supplemented
by
the
county
in
the
way
of
scholarships
to
count,
to
be
used
in
schools
as
a
parent's
choice.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
it
has
not
been
repealed
in
the
sense
that
you
can
repeal
a
resolution.
that's
a
minute
of
a
prior
board,
but
the
action
that
the
board
of
supervisors
has
taken
is
incomplete
and
absolute
negation
of
the
declaration
contained
in
that
resolution
and
to
that
extent,
there
certainly
has
been
a
repeal
of
the
resolution
because
they
have
taken
action
that
is
inconsistent
with
it.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
participating
in
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
we
were
contributing
too.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
we
--
we
do
not
operate
those
schools,
sir.
they
are
operated
by
a
private
board
of
trustees
and
a
private
corporation.
and
we
made
--
the
school
board,
not
the
board
of
supervisors,
made
a
lease
of
school
buildings
to
that
private
corporation
and
that
private
corporation
and
their
board
of
directors
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
the
staff
operate
the
school.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
the
school
board
spends
money
on
them,
yes.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
that
--
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
absolutely
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
i
certainly
think
it
is
in
the
--
in
the
sense
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
it
is
an
integrated
school.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
that's
just
the
point,
sir.
i
say
that
it
has
been
abandoned
because
of
actual
practice
and
the
participation
of
the
school
board
and
the
board
in
the
operation
of
that
school
is
a
complete
negation
of
the
declaration
contained
in
that
resolution,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
we
have
no
objection,
sir.
we
have
--
not
the
board
of
supervisors.
we
have
no
objection.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
we
do
not
run
into
schools.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
well
sir,
we
think
that
we
are
with
--
absolutely
within
our
rights.
we
think
that
we
have
a
complete
right
of
choice
and
we
think
that
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
the
board
of
supervisors
of
prince
edward
county
as
to
whether
or
not
they
levy
tax
upon
the
people
of
prince
edward
county
and
to
fix
a
rate
and
to
name
the
subject
to
tax
on
and
we
think
that's
right
that
it
cannot
be
reached
by
the
judiciary.
now,
we
further
think
that
the
program
that
has
presently
in
effect
in
that
county,
supplemented
by
whatever
funds
might
be
necessary
in
order
to
provide
if
additional
money
is
needed,
holds
out
the
best
opportunity
for
a
solution
of
the
social
and
difficult
problems
involved
in
education
resulting
from
integration.
that
if
that
program
can
be
put
into
effect,
everybody
in
that
county
who
wants
to
go
to
an
integrated
school
or
have
the
right
to
do
it,
colored
people
who
want
to
go
to
a
colored
school
have
the
right
to
do
it
and
the
white
people
who
want
to
go
a
white
school
have
the
right
to
do
it.
and
that,
sir,
is
an
enlargement
of
liberty
that
has
been
declared
by
this
court
to
be
protected
under
the
first
and
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
and
if
you
take
a
different
schools,
your
first
opinion
was
an
enlargement
of
the
liberty
of
colored
people,
but
what
you're
being
asked
to
do
now
is
to
constrict
the
liberty
of
everybody.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
oh
to
keep
them
closed?
we
--
the
question
of
whether
it
closed
or
not,
the
proposition
is
that
we
have
the
absolute
right
not
to
--
to
levy
tax
and
appropriate
money
on
people
that
have
elected
legislative
representatives
that
were
committed
not
to
do
it.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
well,
i
think
--
i
do
not
think
that
the
reason,
when
you're
dealing
with
a
question
of
power,
either
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
under
the
eleventh
amendment,
under
the
constitution
of
virginia
and
i
think
this
is
what
the
decision
that
this
court
holds
that
when
you
are
talking
about
what
a
power
is
and
who
has
the
power
to
do
something,
the
motive
and
the
purpose
that
--
that
power
that
prompts
to
exercise
that
power
is
totally
irrelevant
and
this
court
has
said
that
courts
would
not
investigate
or
inquire
into
it.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
yes,
sir.
yes,
yes,
yes.
now,
when
we
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
school
board,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
nobody
in
the
world
--
i
don't
know
how
much
it
cost
but
a
great
many
of
those
children
are
going
to
school
and
churches
and
improvised
buildings.
but
for
the
high
school,
they
have
been
able
to
construct
a
campus
type
school
at
what
expense,
i
do
not
know
but
i
would
say
certainly
more
than
a
half
million
dollars.
and
it's
been
done
by
the
contribution
of
labor,
of
people,
and
by
the
contributions
of
funds
and
by
the
help
of
private
individuals
in
that
respect
and
never
would.
it
has
not
been
any
public
effort
of
any
public
contribution
to
it,
whatever,
except
what
went
in
the
year
1961
when
the
tuition
grant
law
was
enacted.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
none,
none.
no
public
assistance
from
any
source,
not
since
the
court
ended
its
injunction.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
yes,
sir.
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
i
certainly
do,
sir
and
i'll
get
to
that.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
the
liberty,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
well
sir,
it
was
a
change
from
what
had
been
the
law
for
a
great
many
years
and
in
my
judgment,
it
constituted
an
enlargement
of
rights
or
liberties
but
did
not
constitute
an
affirmative
requirement
of
anything.
now,
if
the
court
please,
back
to
the
question
of
redress
of
rights
deprived
on
the
constitution,
secured
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
in
order,
it
seems
to
me
in
my
simple
way
of
thinking,
to
get
a
decree
that
says
to
prince
edward
county,
you've
got
to
open
these
schools.
you
have
to
enlarge
what
you
have
decided
in
brown
against
board
of
supervisors
--
brown
against
school
board
and
you've
got
to
find
some
federal
right
in
these
petitions.
some
federally
secured
right
to
have
an
education,
and
not
just
in
education
because
to
get
that
--
the
law
of
virginia
provides
it
by
tuition
payments,
but
an
education
inside
of
a
school
house
that
is
owned,
operated,
and
controlled
by
the
state
or
some
political
subdivision.
and
i
say,
that
up
until
now,
there's
no
decision
of
this
court
and
so
far
as
i
know,
no
decision
of
any
state
court
that
takes
issue
with
the
fact
that
education
and
the
method
which
it
provides
is
a
state
matter
and
is
not
a
matter
secured
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
now,
for
the
tuition
grants.
you
will
see
in
the
brief,
reference
to
cases
that
have
been
decided
in
regard
parent
--
parental
rights
with
respect
to
the
training
and
education
of
their
children.
you
will
find
that
these
rights
have
been
established
by
this
court,
as
rights
protected
under
the
fifth
amendment.
and
you
will
find
that
they
are
protected
not
only
against
state
law
such
as
oregon
enacted
the
law
saying
that
all
children
have
to
go
to
a
public
school,
it
was
over
thrown
as
an
invasion
of
parental
liberty.
but
you'll
find
that
in
the
territory
of
hawaii,
the
federal
territorial
government
enacted
arbitrary
and
high
statutes
against
japanese
taught
in
japanese
language
school
and
that
this
court
overthrew
it
as
an
invasion
of
the
fifth
amendment,
the
freedom
of
those
people,
and
that
the
federal
government
could
no
more
invade
that
privilege
than
could
the
state.
in
more
recent
decisions,
this
court
has
related
the
right,
the
freedom
of
association
to
freedom
of
speech
under
the
first
amendment.
i
say
to
you
gentlemen
that
the
tuition
grant
program
of
virginia
is
designed
not
to
deny
anybody
anything,
but
to
give
in
a
democratic
society
the
greatest
opportunity
for
the
solution
of
a
difficult
problem
by
giving
to
every
person
the
liberty
that
is
here
under
this
constitution
that
was
truly
ordained
to
protect
those
freedoms.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
sir?
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
not
one
that's
owned
and
operated
or
controlled
by
the
school
board.
no,
sir,
not
at
the
present
time.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
no
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
no
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
yes
sir.
no
sir,
it
hadn't
been
repealed.
it's
construed
and
the
case
was
recently
decided
by
the
supreme
court
in
the
same
fashion
that
it
had
been
suggested
in
prior
decisions
that
the
general
assembly
have
the
duty
to
establish
a
system,
a
plan
for
public
education,
but
the
public
education
depended
upon
the
election
of
local
authorities
and
operation
schools
upon
what
was
in
the
hands
of
local
authorities.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
sir?
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
yes
sir,
we
have
juris
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
we
have
tuition
grants
at
prince
edward
county
which
is
an
option
that
we
have
under
the
law.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
the
virginia
--
the
decision
of
our
supreme
court,
sir,
and
what
that
section
says
here,
that
the
general
assembly
shall
establish
and
maintain
an
efficient
system
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
--
public
schools.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
and
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
has
construed
it
and
i
take
it
that
that's
--
that
that
is
an
authoritative
construction.
they
have
construed
it
to
mean
that
the
state
of
virginia,
the
general
assembly
has
complied
with
that
provision
of
the
constitution
when
it
adopted
the
school
board
and
provided
the
method
and
the
way
by
which
localities
could
carry
out
the
powers
that
are
opposed
in
them
in
the
constitution.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
may.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
the
cons
--
first
thing
sir
is
that
the
constitution
of
1859
gave
the
board
of
supervisors
exactly
the
same
discretionary
power
that
the
present
constitution
gives.
the
language
in
that
constitution
is
that
the
local
school
--
local
board
of
supervisors
may
levy
taxes.
they
are
not
required
to
levy
any
taxes
and
not
under
that.
now
may
i
say
an
additional
thing,
sir,
about
that
that
if
that
were
an
effort
to
restrict
the
control
of
the
state
of
virginia
of
the
method
and
means
of
providing
education
for
its
people,
it
would
be
in
violation
of
the
tenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
in
that
it
would
deny
to
the
state
of
virginia
rights
of
the
constitution,
the
rights
shall
be
reserved
to
them.
so
that's
my
response
to
that,
sir.
now
if
the
court
please
in
regard
to
the
tuition
grant
statutes
of
virginia,
they
are
not
--
they
have
no
racial
connotation
whatsoever.
they
are
available
to
any
person
for
use
in
any
school
that
meets
the
reasonable
standard
of
education.
i
do
not
contend
that
the
constitutionality
of
those
statutes
are
here
before
this
court.
there
has
been
no
application
of
any
--
of
the
petitioners
or
any
place
for
admission
to
any
school
wherein
a
tuition
grant
has
been
or
was
used.
there
has
been
no
application
of
any
person
that's
in
the
class
of
these
petitions
for
a
tuition
grant
and
--
so
that
they
are
without
anything
in
this
record
that
shows
--
that
by
virtue
of
the
tuition
grant
law
of
virginia,
they
have
been
deprived
of
any
right
secured
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
now
when
you
begin
talking
to
use
in
a
legal
opinion,
terms
such
as
circumvention
of
a
court
decision
or
circumvention
of
a
court
order,
i
submit
to
you
that
you're
using
terms
that
depends
upon
matters
of
judgment
and
doesn't
depend
upon
matters
of
the
law.
how
can
you
circumvent
a
court
order
anymore
than
you
can
circumvent
the
speed
limit?
you
either
violate
it
or
you
don't
violate
it.
i
take
it
that's
the
reason
why
the
rules
of
the
federal
courts
require
that
injunctive
orders
be
spelled
out
in
writing
so
that
a
man
will
know
and
anybody
who's
on
the
one
will
know
when
he's
violating
or
when
he's
not.
and
to
make
a
kind
of
a
mythical
broadside
statement
that
an
act
is
a
circumvention
or
a
frustration
of
a
court
order,
lives
within
the
hands
of
the
court,
a
power
that
is
not
defined
and
that
nobody
can
know
when
they
are
violating
an
order
and
when
they're
not
violating.
we
have
known
that
the
board
of
supervisors
of
prince
edward
county
has
never
violated
any
order
of
any
court.
we
have
never
acted
in
defiance
of
any
order.
we
have
acted
in
what
we
honestly
and
conscientiously
believe
today
are
the
sacred
rights
of
american
people
protected
under
the
fair
constitution
which
you
gentlemen
are
here
to
interpret
and
to
construe
and
to
apply.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
alright
sir.
i
just
want
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
--
they
suggest
sir
that
their
motives
and
that
we
are
circumventing
and
that
we
are
frustrating
an
order
or
that
we're
doing
something
that
not
depriving
them
a
right.
they
never
come
out
and
say,
“here
are
the
right
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
secures
to
me”,
and
here
is
what
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
are.
they
come
in
and
said
the
court
entered
an
order.
and
it
said,
“you
admit
people
to
such
schools
as
you
operate.”
and
it
was
the
expectation
of
their
reply
that
should
operate
public
schools
and
everybody
would
be
admitted
but
nobody
said,
“we
haven't
got
a
right
to
do
what
we're
doing”,
or
that
it
violates
anything
that's
secured
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
that's
the
issue.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
if
all
that
you
have,
sir,
were
public
schools,
if
that
was
all
that
was
conceived
of
under
the
virginia
plan
of
education
that
might
be
a
tenable
position.
but
when
the
virginia
plan
of
education
gives
everybody
tuition
grants
and
gives
the
locality
the
option
to
bring
that
into
effect
as
a
method
of
education
in
that
county
and
the
same
option,
the
same
privilege
is
given
to
every
other
county
and
city
in
virginia
unless,
sir,
the
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
are
reversed,
i
do
not
see
how
it
could
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
i
do
not
--
this
court
--
you
had
a
similar
question.
you
had
quite
a
similar
question
if
you
look
at
the
case
of
millers
against
bowman
which
is
cited
in
the
brief.
the
state
of
missouri
allowed
in
st.
louis
and
certain
areas,
an
appeal
in
certain
types
of
cases.
in
other
areas
of
the
same
state,
they
were
denied
an
appeal
and
the
matter
came
here
and
this
court
held
in
our
–
in
an
opinion
that
is
absolutely
in
point
on
this
very
question
that
that
was
not
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
only
time
in
my
judgment
that
you
get
to
a
question
that
you
can't
delegate
an
option
to
a
locality
is
when
you
get
to
a
right
that
is
secured
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
when
you
get
to
something
that
is
a
privilege
of
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
or
is
a
right
that
the
federal
constitution
requires,
then
you
got
some
limitation
on
what
you
can
do
because
everybody
everywhere
has
got
to
be
subject
to
the
same
thing,
but
when
it's
education
and
education
is
a
state
matter
and
anymore
requirement
for
state
uniformity
with
respect
to
education
and
there
would
be
if
the
state
said,
“we
have
powers.”
and
we
just
put
them
where
we're
pleased
to
put
them
and
you
can't
come
into
court
and
say,
“give
me
a
power
in
my
county
and
give
--
take
it
away
from
him
over
there”
or
something
of
that
nature.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
this
is
what
the
court
has
decided
in
all
of
its
cases,
and
i
do
not
believe
there's
a
case
cited
in
the
attorney
general's
brief
that
holds
to
the
contrary.
all
that
i
could
get
my
hands
on
and
could
look
at
are
absolutely
not
in
point.
they
either
go
off
on
some
state
constitutional
restriction
of
the
delegated
power
or
they
have
got
a
statute
that's
on
the
state
level
and
as
applied
as
absolutely
a
clear
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
said
a
moment
ago
that
i
did
not
think
that
the
tuition
grant
program
here
is
before
you.
i
still
do
not
think
so.
it
is
not
impeachable
on
the
grounds
that
they
impeach
it
if
they've
got
any
rights
and
they
go
out
to
tenants
of
the
schools
that
operate
it,
then
let
them
have
--
make
an
application
and
bring
this
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
we
did
that
judge
and
got
knocked
there
by
hall,
that's
all.[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
that's
exactly
--
that's
substantial
on
what
we
have,
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
well
judge,
i
would
--
i
would
avoid
saying
it
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
--
in
just
a
way
you
do.
i
say
that
it's
not
done
to
avoid
integration.
i'd
say
that
it
was
done
to
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
--
to
give
--
to
enlarge
the
liberty
and
the
freedom
of
people
under
the
constitution.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
you
are
correct.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
you
are
correct.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
you
are
correct.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
that
is
correct,
sir.
that
is
correct
and
we
have
the
argument
in
our
brief.
i
do
not
think
that
the
tuition
grant
program
as
i
have
said
is
here
before
the
court.
the
solicitor
general
asked
you
not
to
enjoin
tuition
grants
on
the
basis
of
the
liberty
involved.
he
asked
you
to
enjoin
the
tuition
grants
on
a
conditional
basis
until
public
schools
are
open.
i
think
if
the
court
feels
compelled
to
do
anything
in
this
case,
that
is
far
and
away
the
desirable
--
the
more
desirable
thing
to
do.
because
the
issue,
the
actual
issue,
and
this
is
a
tremendously
important
question,
this
matter
of
how,
what
does
it
reach
of
the
privilege
of
the
parents
and
of
citizens
to
select
their
associations
in
education
and
to
have
a
freedom
to
bring
up
their
children
as
a
will
involved
the
most
intimate
and
the
most
sacred
natural
rights
of
people.
and
i
do
not
think
and
i
hope
that
this
court
will
not
enter
an
order
that
will
so
restrict
the
freedom
that
i
know
that
you
gentlemen
are
dedicated
to
preserve
--
preservation
of
perhaps
and
more
conscious
of
perhaps
than
almost
anybody.
and
that
whatever
you
do
with
this
case,
that
you
will
not
take
brown
against
board
of
education
which
was
in
truth
an
enlargement
of
the
liberty
of
mankind,
and
use
it
as
a
means
to
exercise
compulsion
and
force
against
people.
the
opportunity,
the
genius
of
our
constitution
is
in
the
blessings
of
liberty
that
it
protects
and
bestows
upon
our
people.
the
solution
of
this
problem
like
the
greatness
of
our
country
in
so
many
respects
depends
upon
the
preservation
of
it
and
when
you
give
people
freedom.
you
can
take
away
these
restraints
on
account
of
race.
i
suppose
many,
they
should
never
have
been
in
the
law,
but
let's
not
in
the
name
of
advancing
what
we
think
in
our
private
judgment
maybe
a
good
thing
to
take
away
and
constrict
the
liberties
of
people
because
in
truth,
that
has
been
historically
the
way
that
we
have
solved
these
difficult
problems
and
the
way
that
we
have
brought
about
unity
and
cohesion
with
our
people,
and
it
is
a
possibility
here
that
holds
out
a
peaceful
existence
of
people.
virginia
has
had
peace
in
racial
matter
since
this
program
has
been
in
effect
but
whatever
--
whatever
--
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
if
your
honor
please,
we
have
done
every
--
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
i
think
they
have.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
yes,
i
think
they
have.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
sir,
they
have
had
the
same
opportunity
to
that
--
everybody
else
in
the
county
has
had
and
they
have
rejected
those
things
that
were
provided
for
them.
nobody
has
wanted
to
be
harsh
on
it.
if
it
please,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
no
other
way
to
get
the
decision
of
this
court
except
to
bring
this
case
here,
that's
the
only
way.
this
issue
has
to
be
decided
and
upon
the
decision
of
it.
and
if
you
look
for
a
motive
and
a
purpose
in
the
people
of
prince
edward
county,
looked
for
a
motive
and
purpose
that
has
insisted
that
they
bring
to
this
court
the
constitutional
principles
upon
which
they
have
acted
and
find
that
answer
as
to
whether
or
not
they
are
right
that
they
live
in
freedom
or
whether
or
not
it
is
a
mistake
and
that
there
is
some
other
solution
or
some
other
course
that
they
should
follow.
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
there
--
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
you
will
find
in
there,
sir,
that
there
were
appeals
that
were
allowed
in
the
urban
courts
in
cases
in
which
appeals
were
not
allowed
in
the
rural
courts.
here
is
a
quotation
is
on
it,
you
can
find
in
the
briefs.
it
contemplates
fourteenth
amendment,
persons
and
classes
of
persons.
it
has
no
--
it
has
no
respect
to
local
and
municipal
regulations
that
do
not
injuriously
effect
or
discriminate
between
persons
or
classes
of
persons
within
the
places
or
municipalities
for
which
such
regulations
are
made.
the
amendment
could
never
have
been
intended
to
prevent
a
state
from
arranging
and
parceling
out
the
jurisdiction
of
its
several
courts
at
its
discretion.
no
such
restriction
as
this
could
have
been
in
view
or
could
have
been
included
in
the
prohibition
that
no
state
shall
deny
that
any
person
within
its
jurisdiction
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.
it
is
the
right
of
every
state
to
establish
such
course
as
it
sees
fit
and
to
prescribe
their
several
jurisdictions
as
to
territorial
extent
to
subject
matter
and
amount
and
the
finality
and
effect
of
their
decisions,
provided
that
it
does
not
encroach
upon
the
proper
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
and
does
not
abridge
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizens
of
the
united
states.
it
does
not
deprive
any
person
of
his
rights
without
due
process
of
law
nor
denied
to
any
person
the
equal
protection
of
the
law
including
the
equal
right
to
resort
to
their
appropriate
courts
for
redress.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
yes
sir,
and
there's
no
discrimination
within
the
counties.
mr.
j.
segar
gravatt
no
sir,
no
sir.
the
law
within
the
territorial
limits
of
the
county
is
absolutely
equal
with
respect
to
everybody.
the
inequality
results
from
a
private
decision
of
these
petitioners
not
to
accept
the
means
that
were
provided
for
them
and
the
fact
of
it
is
that
they
are
now
being
educated
and
if
they
would
accept
the
means,
they
could
provide
the
education
very
easily
and
have
it.
