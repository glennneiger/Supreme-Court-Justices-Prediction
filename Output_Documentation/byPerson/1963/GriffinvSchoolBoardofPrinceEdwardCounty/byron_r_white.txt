but
the
state
funds
that
were
enjoined
to
be
dispersed
were
on
the
--
is
going
to
attend
on
the
ground
on
a
state
ground,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
comes
to
the
state
--
the
county
was
on
a
constitutional
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
the
whole
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
carter
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
carter,
i
gather
that
you
don't
argue
them
that
--
or
you
don't
feel
that
it's
necessary
to
argue
here
that
if
virginia
granted
the
local
option
of
the
counties
to
run
the
schools
or
not
as
they
saw
it
fit,
some
county
just
decided
for
some
reason
that
they
were
going
to
run
schools,
as
for
example,
there
weren't
enough
students
in
the
county,
i
take
it
you
would
not
object
to
that
particular
law
or
that
particular
exercise
of
local
option.
but
you
do
say
that
if
the
option
is
permitted
in
order
to
avoid
the
integrated
education
or
desegregated
education
that
that
kind
of
a
local
option
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
feel
that
argument
is
essentially
your
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
now
--
essentially
your
narrower
ground
is
the
fact
of
why
they
closed
the
school
and
you
feel
that's
established
in
the
record
clearly
enough.
is
there
argument
about
that
at
all
by
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
we'll
find
that
operation
later.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
gravatt.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
that
the
public
schools
of
prince
edward
were
--
really
weren't
close
when
they
--
i
mean
as
such.
the
action
was
not
to
terminate
public
education,
but
the
action
was
to
terminate
the
giving
of
funds
to
schools
that
were
operated
to
educate
both
negroes
and
whites
together.
that's
the
action
that
was
taken,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i've
--
as
i
read
it,
it's
the
1956
resolution,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
this
--
the
1956
resolution
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
--
well,
it
would
have
been
a
violation
of
the
--
whatever
action
the
board
of
supervisors
took
who
have
entered
into
[inaudible]
that
you're
just
been
telling
the
chief
justice
about?
you
say
it
would
have
been
a
public
school
but
it
would
have
been
an
integrated
school.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
is
that
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
--
so
that
the
board
of
supervisors
hasn't
taken
action
to
bar
this
kind
of
public
education?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
--
what
action
did
the
--
what
action
did
the
board
of
supervisors
take
then
with
regards
to
schools
in
1959?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
board
of
supervisors
won't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
won't
provide
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
provide
buildings?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
gravatt,
i
take
it
then
that
you
do
not
argue
that
the
prince
edward
county
or
the
state
of
virginia
has
the
constitutional
right
and
privilege
to
keep
the
schools
in
prince
--
the
public
schools
in
prince
edward
county
closed?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
say
that
prince
edward
county
got
the
right
to
keep
the
school
--
public
schools
closed
if
they
want
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
they
have
got
a
right
to
keep
them
closed
for
the
--
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
1956
resolution?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
mcilwaine,
you
don't
make
any
eleventh
amendment
argument
in
regard
to
any
acts
against
the
local
official?
justice
byron
r.
white
nor
do
you
--
nor
do
you
make
an
eleventh
amendment
argument
insofar
as
they
sought
an
injunction
to
keep
--
to
keep
the
state
board
from
--
from
following
the
â€“
tuition
--
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
these
schools
weren't
closed
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
they
have
the
right
--
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
they
have
got
a
right
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
this
is
--
this
is
why
they
were
closed.
justice
byron
r.
white
from
this
i
cite
your
position
i
take
it
[inaudible]
constitutional
permissible
that
involves
the
public
school
for
that
purpose.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
had
[inaudible]
provide
the
local
option
on
any
basis?
