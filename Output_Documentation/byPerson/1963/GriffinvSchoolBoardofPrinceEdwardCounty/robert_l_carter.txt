mr.
robert
l.
carter
if
the
court
please.
this
case
is
here
for
the
second
time
on
the
merits
and
because
it's
the
petitioner's
view
that
this
is
a
case
that
has
influenced
to
great
deal
by
facts
in
its
history
with
the
court's
permission,
i
will
attempt
to
summarize
the
history
of
the
proceedings
below.
some
time
in
the
spring
of
1951,
a
group
of
negro
high
school
students
then
attending
the
robert
r.
moton
high
school
which
was
a
negro
high
school
in
prince
edward
county,
virginia,
believing
that
they
were
not
being
accorded
adequate
or
equal
education
opportunities,
decided
to
go
on
strike
from
school
and
left
the
school.
they
got
in
touch
with
the
lawyers
and
the
lawyers
persuaded
them
that
the
best
way
for
them
to
present
their
claim
was
to
present
their
grievances
in
court.
and
eventually,
in
may
of
1951,
a
complaint
was
filed
in
the
united
state's
district
court,
attacking
the
constitutional
validity
of
virginia's
separate
school
law.
that
cause
eventually
reached
this
court
and
was
disposed
of
in
brown
versus
the
board
of
education
on
the
merits
in
1954.
in
1955,
this
court
remanded
the
cause
with
instructions
to
the
district
court
to
grant
relief,
that
is
the
transformation
on
the
separate
and
segregated
school
system
to
a
school
system
without
discrimination
based
upon
race
with
all
deliberate
fees.
in
1955
on
remand,
petitioner
made
an
application
to
the
district
court
seeking
implementation
of
that
decree
and
therefore
the
beginning
of
the
process
of
desegregation
by
september
of
1955.
the
district
court
then
a
statutory
court,
answered
a
general
order
and
which
it
forbade
any
discrimination,
but
held
that
the
time
was
not
ripe
and
there
was
not
time
enough
for
the
county
school
board
to
make
plans
for
the
admission
of
students
without
segregation.
in
1956,
petitioner
appeared
before
the
court
again
and
again
requested
that
this
court's
order
be
implemented
beginning
in
september
of
1956.
the
district
court,
still
a
statutory
court,
took
this
matter,
but
held
that
since
all
of
the
constitutional
issues
had
been
resolved
that
the
question
for
resolution
was
now
for
a
single
court
for
the
resident
judge
and
dissolved
the
statutory
court
and
the
matter
was
referred
to
the
resident
judge.
it
came
on
for
hearing
before
the
single
judge
in
1957
with
an
application
by
petitioner
for
implementation
as
of
september,
1957.
the
district
judge
ruled
that
the
time
was
not
ripe.
he
construed
this
court's
decree
and
implementation
decree
as
giving
him
discretion
and
then
under
the
circumstances
he
said,
“the
time
was
not
ripe
for
any
decree
to
be
entered
because
he
did
not
know
when
prince
edward
county
would
be
able
to
comply
with
this
courts
decree.”
mr.
robert
l.
carter
this
was
in
1957.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
all
of
the
citations
--
all
of
these
cases
are
cited
in
our
brief
of
the
citations
here.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
taking
the
view
that
the
time
had
come
for
the
county
board
of
prince
edward
county
to
be
told
to
apply,
to
commence
compliance
with
this
court's
order.
the
matter
then
came
on
for
hearing
before
the
district
court
again
in
1958
and
again,
the
petitioners
requested
the
time
of
compliance
be
set
as
of
september
of
1958.
at
that
time,
the
county
school
board
introduced
evidence
showing
that
they
needed
more
time.
it
indicated
that
a
survey
was
being
made
by
the
--
they
appointed
persons
to
make
a
survey
and
may
based
upon
what
the
results
of
that
survey
would
give
them
help
in
complying
with
decree.
the
district
judge
felt
after
hearing
the
evidence
that
10
years
from
1955,
10
years
from
the
date
of
the
implementation
decree
of
this
court
would
be
at
the
time
when
it
would
be
ripe
for
the
school
board
to
be
ordered
to
commence
the
segregation.
so
he
set
the
date
as
of
september,
1965
for
the
county
school
board
to
commence
the
desegregation
of
the
schools.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
on
may
5,
1959
and
set
the
date
for
the
commencement
of
the
segregation
of
the
high
schools
as
of
september,
1959
and
ordered
the
county
school
board
to
make
plans
for
the
elimination
of
segregation
in
the
elementary
schools
at
the
earliest
practicable
date.
now
in
1956,
in
may
of
1956,
the
county
school
--
the
county
board
of
supervisors
enacted
a
resolution
indicating
that
they
would
not
levy
any
taxes
or
appropriate
any
funds
for
the
maintenance
and
support
of
any
public
schools
in
the
county
in
which
negroes
and
whites
were
educated
together.
that
resolution
is
set
out
in
the
record
and
in
our
petition.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
it
would
be
easier
for
me
if
i
can
give
it
to
you.
in
the
petition,
it
is
set
out
in
the
petition
as
appendix
b.
at
30
a.
after
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
may
5,
1959,
the
county
school
board
--
the
board
of
supervisors
i
am
sorry,
and
this
is
set
out
at
appendix
c
of
our
petition,
passed
a
resolution
refusing
to
levy
any
taxes
and
to
appropriate
any
funds
for
the
maintenance
of
public
schools
in
prince
edward
county.
it
made
a
public
statement
to
this
effect,
and
made
it
a
part
of
its
record,
its
reasons
for
doing
so
and
its
reasons
where
that
it
would
not
and
would
not
support
and
maintain
any
schools
in
which
negro
and
white
children
were
educated
together
in
the
light
of
the
fourth
coming
court
decree
they
would
be
required
to
do.
now
this
brings
us
roughly
to
the
present
proceedings
which
are
presently
before
the
court.
in
september
of
1959,
the
prince
edward
school
found
--
county
school
foundation
which
had
been
charted
in
1955,
began
the
operation
of
secondary
and
elementary
schools
for
the
white
children
in
the
county.
it
enrolled,
there
were
some
roughly
1,500
white
students
who
were
going
to
the
public
school
as
of
june
of
1959
and
it
enrolled
some
little
over
1,300
of
these
students.
during
the
first
year
that
is
september
of
the
1959,
1960
school
term,
no
tuition
was
charged.
but
during
the
second
year,
the
board,
the
foundation
set
forth
tuition
charges
of
$240
for
the
elementary
grades
and
$265
for
the
secondary
grades.
on
july
18
of
1960,
the
prince
edward
county
board
of
supervisors
enacted
two
ordinances,
one,
permitting
a
grant
in
aid
of
education,
a
tuition
grant
of
$100
per
child
to
attend
a
nonsectarian
private
school
in
the
county
and
the
only
nonsectarian
private
school
in
the
county
was
the
prince
edward
school
foundation
and
it
allowed
as
well
a
25%
tax
credit,
a
rebate
of
taxes
to
persons
who
made
any
contributions
for
the
support
and
maintenance
of
a
nonsectarian
private
school
in
the
county
which
of
course,
as
i
indicated
was
the
school
foundation.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
the
tax
credit
was,
as
i
remember,
was
not
but
the
tuition
grant
was
for
public
schools
outside
the
county
and
within
the
county.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no.
there
was
no
public
but
private
schools
in
the
county
and
public
schools
outside.
now
the
state's
scholarship
program
also
was
to
provide
something
like
$250
and
$275
for
scholarship
aid
for
children
to
go
to
a
public
school
outside
their
county
and
to
a
private
nonsectarian
school
within
the
county
and
pursuant
to
this,
as
the
record
indicates
in
the
trial,
over
1,300
white
students
received
aid
during
the
second
year
for
attending
the
schools
of
the
prince
edward
school
foundation,
both
from
the
state's
scholarship
aid
and
from
the
local
tuition
grants.
there
was
no
regular
of
systematic
instruction
for
the
negro
students
although
they
were
kept
together
in
centers
operated
by
an
organization
known
as
the
prince
edward
christian
association.
now
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
this
was
organized
by
a
group
of
negro
ministers
headed
by
the
reverend
griffin
who
was
the
father
of
the
chief
petitioner
before
the
court.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
grants
were
available
for
persons
who
attended
a
school
for
a
180
days
and
a
systematic
course
of
instruction.
the
persons
who
attended
the
center
didn't
feel
that
they
complied
with
the
requirements
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
the
trial,
both
the
state
superintendent
of
public
instruction
in
virginia
indicated
that
the
schools
or
the
centers
operating
would
not
qualify
for
the
state's
scholarship
grant.
in
other
words,
these
centers
were
open
for
a
few
hours.
there
was
no
systematic
course
of
instruction
and
they
were
not
open
for
180
days.
there
was
some
testimony
by
the
person
who
administered
the
local
program
that
they
would
be
available
or
that
they
ought
to
be
available,
but
i
think
the
substance
of
the
record
would
be
that
they
would
not
be
available
because
they
didn't
come
within
the
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
five,
the
record
shows
that
five
negroes
who
went
to
school
outside
the
county
did
receive
the
grant.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
there
were
both,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
the
state's,
they
were
made
available,
state's
scholarship
fund
was
made
available
for
the
–
state
and
local
scholarship
funds
were
made
available
to
carry
out
this
program.
this
is
under
the
tuition
grant
program
of
the
state.
pursuant
to
what
the
state
allocates
and
has,
says
that
a
person
who
wants
to
attend
the
school
to
a
private
sectarian
school
within
the
county
will
receive
$250
at
the
elementary
grades
and
$275
at
the
high
school
grades.
the
county
does
not
have
to
participate
although
locality
does
not,
but
if
the
statute
indicates
that
if
they
do
not,
then
the
state
will
withhold
funds
that
it
would
ordinary
give
for
non
school
purposes.
this
was
to
encourage
the
local
counties
and
localities
to
enact
programs
in
aid
of
this
and
this
is
what
prince
edward
county
did.
so
that
prince
edward
county
gives
$100
and
the
state
was
giving
a
$150
and
$125,
making
the
total
for
elementary
grade
to
$225
and
for
high
schools
$250.
after
the
case
was
sent,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
may
5,
1959,
the
mandate
of
the
district
court
was
not
enacted
or
issued
an
order
on
the
mandate
until
april
22,
1960.
in
june
of
1960
and
this
begins
the
formal
part
of
the
proceedings
which
we
bring
here.
the
petitioner
filed
a
supplemental
complaint
which
had
been
amended
on
january
of
1961
and
in
the
amended
supplemental
complaint,
the
petitioner
added
as
parties,
the
original
proceeding
was
against
the
board
of
--
the
county
board
and
the
division
superintendent,
added
as
parties
defendants,
the
county
board
of
supervisor,
the
state
board
of
education,
the
superintendent
of
public
instruction
and
the
prince
edward
county
treasurer.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
state
superintendent
of
public
instruction,
yes
sir
and
the
county
treasurer
and
sought
to
--
and
requested
relief
on
the
federal
court
on
four
grounds.
one,
to
have
the
court
enjoined
the
defendant
from
refusing
to
maintain
and
operate
public
schools
in
prince
edward
county.
two,
from
the
expending
public
funds
for
the
direct
or
in
support
of
any
private
schools
which
practiced
discrimination
and
from
allowing
tax
credits
to
be
used
to
support
any
school
that
practiced
discrimination
and
restraining
defendants
from
conveying,
leasing,
or
transferring
possession
of
any
of
the
school
property
to
a
private
organization.
the
case
was
tried
on
these
facts
in
the
court
below
in
july
of
1961
and
after
hearing
the
court
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
local
tuition
grant
program
was
an
invasion
of
this
court's
decree
and
order
and
that
therefore
it
came
within
the
condemnation
of
cooper
versus
aaron,
and
that
the
tax
credit
also
constitutes,
the
local
tax
credit
program
constituted
such
invasion.
therefore,
those,
both
of
those
were
enjoined
on
that
ground.
the
court
also
held
a,
in
a
construction
of
the
state's
scholarship
program
that
it
was
intended
to
be
applied
only
when
the
public
schools
were
open.
so
that
for
these
reasons,
it
enjoined
both
the
state
scholarship
program
and
any
of
the
tuition
grants
locally
for
so
long
as
the
public
schools
remain
closed.
it
reached
the
conclusion
however
that
insofar
as
the
merits,
the
basic
merits
of
the
claim,
that
is
whether
the
schools
could
remain
closed,
could
be
closed
and
whether
this
was
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
involved
questions
of
state
law
and
that
these
questions
could
not
be
settled
without
an
adjudication
of
state
law
matters
and
applying
the
doctrine
of
federal
abstention,
it
withheld
decree
--
it
withheld
ruling
on
these
questions
until
this
issue
had
been
settled.
we
took,
we
meaning
petitioners,
went
into
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
on
mandamus,
seeking
to
have
that
court
construe
and
determine
the
import
of
section
136
of
the
constitution
of
virginia
as
to
whether
that
provision
compelled
and
required
and
mandated
the
board
of
supervisors
to
appropriate
funds
and
levy
taxes
for
the
operation
of
public
schools.
that
question
was
decided
in
the
negative.
the
court
held
that
this
was
the
power
where
this
provision
was
discretionary,
that
the
virginia
constitution
mandated
the
general
assembly
to
maintain
schools
but
the
question
of
whether
appropriation
should
be
made
by
the
county
board
of
supervisors
under
136
was
discretionary.
we
then
returned
to
the
district
court
seeking
further
relief
in
the
light
of
that
adjudication.
the
district
court
in
july
of
1962,
reached
the
conclusion
that
it
would
no
longer
apply
the
doctrine
of
federal
abstention,
that
the
schools
had
been
closed
and
often
defined
of
the
fundamental
law,
and
that
the
public
schools
in
prince
edward
county
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
could
not
be
closed
as
long
as
the
state
of
virginia
maintained
schools
in
the
rest
of
the
state.
for
this
reason,
it
said
that
this
was
an
adjudication
of
the
federal
claims
where
it
would
not
issue
an
injunction
in
support
of
this
because
an
injunction
may
not
be
required.
it
reached
the
conclusion
of
what,
that
the
--
since
the
defendants
might
voluntarily,
the
law
having
been
declared
complied
with
the
court's
order,
that
it
would
withhold
issuing
a
decree
but
it
ordered
the
county
board
to
make
plans
for
the
admission
of
--
for
the
reopening
of
public
schools
and
for
the
admission
of
students
without
regard
to
race
by
september
of
1962.
and
that
if
the
schools
were
not
opened,
the
court
set
the
matter
down
for
a
hearing
on
september
the
7th
in
1962
where
would
--
it
would
listen
to
all
of
the
applications
and
orders
made
counsel
of
record.
on
september
the
7th,
it
was
clear
when
the
counsel
appeared
in
court
that
no
plans
had
been
made,
that
no
plans
would
be
made
and
that
the
schools
would
not
be
opened.
the
court
then
reaffirmed
its
ruling,
but
deferred
entering
of
injunctive
decree,
pending
review
of
this
matter
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
by
this
court.
we
appealed
from
the
order
on
two
grounds.
one,
on
the
ground
that
the
district
court
should
have
issued
injunctive
relief
and
secondly,
we
appealed
on
the
grounds
that
the
limitation
of
the
injunction
against
the
use
of
state
scholarship
funds,
local
tuition
grants,
and
certain
tax
credits.
for
as
long
as
the
public
schools
remain
closed
it
was
too
narrow
a
reading
of
the
rights
of
the
petitioners
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
contended
that
there
should
have
been
a
broader
injunction
against
is
to
bar
the
use
of
state
money
for
any
school
that
discriminated
and
for
the
use
of
state
money
to
evade
and
frustrate
the
rights
of
the
petitioners.
the
court
of
appeals
filed
a
motion
for
a
--
to
accelerate
our
field
with
the
hope
that
the
matter
would
be
adjudicated
and
finally
settled
for
the
opening
of
schools
by
september
of
1963.
the
hearing
was
held
in
the
court
of
appeals
--
court
of
appeals
in
january.
argument
was
held
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
january
of
1963
and
in
august
of
‘63,
the
court
handed
down
its
opinion.
in
its
opinion
and
the
divided
vote,
it
held
that
the
doctrine
of
federal
abstention
should
have
applied
to
the
whole
matter
which
was
before
the
lower
court,
both
in
respect
to
the
state
scholarship
program,
local
tuition
grant
program,
and
in
respect
to
the
basic
rights
of
the
petitioners
as
to
whether
the
schools
could
remain
closed.
and
at
that
point,
there
was
a
case
pending
in
the
courts
which
the
defendants
had
instituted
and
the
court
held
that
–
vacated
the
judgment
of
both
judgments
of
the
lower
court
awaiting
their
determination.
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
in
december,
after
we
had
applied
for
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
here,
came
down
with
its
opinion
in
this
matter,
holding
that
the
virginia
school
program
was
in
effect
a
local
option
program,
that
there
was
no
state
power,
no
power
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
state
board,
local
county
board
or
superintendent
public
of
instruction
to
open
and
operate
or
maintain
and
support
the
public
schools
in
prince
edward
county
as
long
as
the
county
board
of
supervisors
did
not
levy
taxes
and
appropriate
funds
for
that
purpose.
and
that
there
was
no
power
in
the
state
to
compel
the
local
county
board
of
supervisors
to
appropriate
funds
for
that
purpose,
and
that
the
general
assembly
had
--
although
it
was
under
a
mandate
to
provide
schools
and
to
maintain
an
efficient
system
of
public
education
that
had
done
this,
when
it
had
established
a
system
pursuant
to
which
if
the
local
county
and
districts
desire
to
that
they
could
participate
in
and
that
the
law
did
not
require
that
they
should
operate
the
schools.
this
court
granted
the
–
set
the
matter
down
thereafter
on
the
merits.
now
i
would
want
to
make
one
point
before
i
leave
the
facts.
in
september
14
of
1951,
the
state
was
made
a
party
to
these
proceedings
on
motion,
on
its
motion
and
when
the
cause
was
here
and
before
it
was
a
party
to
the
proceeding.
we
are
aware
of
no
order
that
has
eliminated
the
state
that
it
had
been
withdrawn.
in
each
of
the
proceedings,
each
of
the
hearings
in
the
district
court
and
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
history
of
this
case,
the
attorney
general
of
virginia
has
represented
--
had
been
represented
and
has
argued
up
through
the
may
5,
1959
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
delay
and
for
frustration
and
for
delay
in
the
implementation
of
the
court's
orders.
this
was
at
a
point
when
only
the
division
superintendent
and
the
county
board
of
education
were
parties
to
these
proceedings.
with
the
amended
supplemental
complaint,
the
attorney
general
has
been
in
the
proceedings
representing
the
state
board
of
education
and
the
state
superintendent
of
public
instruction.
i
raise
this
question
not
for
the
technical
question
as
to
whether
the
state
is
before
the
court
as
a
party,
but
i
think
that
it
is
important
that
the
highest
officer
of
the
state
was
aware
or
order
or
appoint
to
what
was
going
on,
knew
what
was
going
on
and
indeed
participated
in
the
arguments
before
the
court
and
the
theory
of
the
county
board
of
supervisors
that
they
had
a
legal
right
to
not
to
implement
this
--
to
have
this
court
decree
them.
now
it's
our
position
where
the
nature
of
this
case,
the
kind
of
case
of
which
it
is
the
delays
and
the
frustration
and
the
protracted
nature
of
this
cause
and
the
facts
which
we
had
set
up.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i'm
sorry
if
i
didn't
make
that
clear.
they
were
enjoined
by
the
--
in
1961
by
an
order
of
the
court,
the
grants
were
enjoined.
the
state
grants
and
the
local
grants
were
enjoined
for
as
long
as
the
public
schools
remained
close.
when
the
matter
was
vacated
by
the
judgment
it
was
vacated
by
the
court
of
appeals,
we
sought
a
stay
which
was
denied
by
the
court
of
appeals,
but
granted
–
a
sort
and
order
issued
by
its
use.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
so
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
pending
its
determination
by
this
court,
the
injunction
of
the
district
court
is
still
operating.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
correct.
they
had
not
been
paid
since
the
order
was
issued
in
november
of
1961.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
tax
credits,
no
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
tax
credits
were
also
enjoined
by
the
district
court
in
november
of
1961
and
in
order
--
and
the
district
court
did
this
on
constitutional
grounds
that
this
was
an
evasion
of
rights
and
actually
i
believe
in
last
year,
this
summer,
the
county
board
of
supervisors
re-appealed
the
ordinance
in
regard
to
tax
credits.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
they
receive
insofar
at
the
present
time
they
are
receiving
none
from
the
state.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
they
may
have
received
some
bus
transportation
and
so
forth
but
they
are
receiving
substantially
nothing
from
the
state.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir,
the
prince
edward
school
foundation?
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
it's
being
financed
apparently
by
the
private
sources.
i'm
in
no
position
to
state
in
the
court.
it
is
not
being
financed
by
state
funds.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
there
are
no
state
funds
that
are
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
that
is
correct
but
the
first
year
they
charged
no
tuition.
i
don't
even
know
whether
they're
charging
tuition
at
the
present
time.
all
i
know
is
that
the
school
is
operating
but
it
is
not
functioning.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
the
--
in
september
of
this
year
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
this
past
year
and
the
state
authorities
take
from
the
front
because
i
get
some
credit
to
the
united
states
government,
but
at
least
to
the
efforts
of
the
department
of
justice,
a
school
has
been
organized
which
i
think
it's
called
the
prince
edward
free
association
something
of
that
kind
in
which
the
negro
students
are
now
being
given
instruction.
the
school
is
operating
without
the
restrictions
based
upon
race
and
they
are,
i'm
advised,
a
few
white
students
present,
but
this
is
the
first
time
that
the
negro
students
since
1959
that
we
see
any
kind
of
systematic
instruction.
i'm
also
advised
that
this
is
a
temporary
manner
that
they
are
engaged
in
for
the
most
part
of
remedial
work
and
that
it
is
not
put
their
permanent
belief
away
but
as
a
staff
gap
for
until
this
course
had
been
determined.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
being
financed
by
private
foundations.
the
department
of
justice
got
together
a
group
of
persons
of
private
resources.
it
also
has
in
support,
i
must
say,
in
the
fairness
of
the
governor
of
virginia
and
certain
of
the
educators
of
virginia
who
are
helping
to
operate
this
school.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
none
have
–
as
far
as
i
know,
none
have
tried
to
get
in
but
the
--
i
think
that
it's
fair
to
say
without
equivocation
that
the
school
--
the
school
was
organized
for
white
students
and
that
it
was
organized
to
take
care
of
the
education
of
white
students
only.
now,
this
was
its
purpose
and
this
is
how
it
has
operated
and
functioned
up
to
this
time.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
there's
something
like
about
there
were
1,500
but
i
think
roughly,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
it's
about
1,300.
the
record
shows
about
1,358.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
i
think
that's
the
record
figures.
the
figure
given
for
the
negroes
is
1,700
to
1,800
students.
now
the
prince
edward
consented
this
christian
association
of
operating
took
care
i
think,
of
about
250
of
them,
but
now
the
schools
are
being
opened
and
in
time
for
all
those
who
can
go.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
it's
about
50-50.
it's
about
50%
negro,
50%
white.
maybe,
slightly
more
negroes,
but
i
think
that
in
general,
that's
just
about
what
it
is.
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
didn't,
i'm
afraid
i
don't
know.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
think
it's
because
for
two
reasons,
one,
the
negro
parents
in
the
school
in
the
prince
edward
county
take
the
view
that
the
granting
aid
are
an
evasion
of
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
oh,
no,
they've
got
nothing
now.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
because
the
court
in
1951,
issued
an
injunction
barring
state's
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
ever
since
--
at
the
conclusion
of
a
good
trial
in
1951,
the
court
handed
down
an
opinion
and
enjoin.
and
although
the
judgment
was
vacated
below
by
the
court
of
appeals,
this
court,
mr.
justice
brennan,
stayed
the
execution
of
the
court
of
appeals
decree
pending
decision
here.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
yes
sir.
the
legality
of
the
tuition
grant
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
is
before
this
court
and
the
states
scholarship
program
is
before
this
court,
the
questions
we
raised
as
well
as
the
basic
issue
as
to
whether
this
court
has
the
power
and
whether
the
petitioners
make
a
valid
claim
to
argue
that
the
public
schools
in
prince
edward
county
cannot
be
closed.
these
are
the
matters
that
we
wish
to
present
to
the
court
for
adjudication.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it
was
suggested
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
possibility
that
that
ordinance
might
make
--
it
appears
that
the
county
was
still
participating
in
the
education
sponsored
by
prince
edward
school
foundation
and
it
was
apparent,
i
merely
suggested
apparently
in
the
light
of
that
suggestion
from
the
court
of
appeals
is
the
tax
credits
were
repealed.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
what
we
did
was
that
we
understood
the
court
of
appeals
for
order
to
mean
that
both
the
1951
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
had
been
vacated
and
the
1961
and
1962
which
in
our
view
would
have
meant
that
the
county
was
free
to
use
both
tax
credits,
local
tuition
grants
and
so
forth.
that's
why
we
asked
for
stay
so
that
the
status
quo
would
remain
as
it
was
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
effect
of
that
state'
was
to
prevent
the
use
of
any
tax
credits
or
local
tuition
grants
or
state
scholarship
funds
until
this
case
have
been
further
determined
here.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
we
want
to
add
two
--
one
other
point
and
that
is
that
this
during
the
course
of
these
proceedings
there
have
been
three
sets
of
petitions
that
began
with
over
a
hundred
petitioners
and
the
main
petitioner
was
a
dr.
davis
who
came
here.
by
the
time
the
matter
was
before
the
court
in
1957,
these
were
high
school
students.
almost
all
of
these
petitioners
that
graduated
and
they
were
substituted
in
the
proceedings
to
continue,
not
in
the
name
of
allen
and
the
matter
was
brought
before
the
court
in
the
amendment
supplemental
complaint,
we
introduced
a
third
set
of
petitioners
because
all
of
those
had
graduated.
so
that
what
we
assert
to
bring
to
the
court
is
that
even
though
the
law
is
in
this
case
as
we
believe
and
assert
has
been
settled
there
has
been
an
entire
generation
of
negro
children
who
have
been
--
who
have
not
been
allowed
or
permitted
to
enjoy
the
constitutional
right
which
this
court
declared
to
be
theirs.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
would
think
so
and
i
would
--
it
would
be
my
position
or
it
would
be
--
that
would
be
such
a
denial
and
for
several
reasons,
one,
because
of
the
vitality
and
necessity
of
education,
although
this
court
and
other
courts
had
never
said
that
there
is
a
duty
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
maintain
an
education.
the
state
having
assumed
that
obligation,
i
think
it
puts
them
in
entirely
different
posture
when
it
attempts
to
withdraw.
i
might
be
in
a
little
more
difficult
position
if
the
state
were
beginning
to
have
the
education
in
various
of
the
counties
and
didn't
have
in
another.
but
in
this
instance,
the
case
of
state
has
withdrawn
a
vital
necessity
from
that
it
has
allocating
to
various
persons.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
--
you
can't
make
a
distinction
in
county
based
on
geography
or
to
apply
an
education
is
more
important
to
the
individual's
concern.
and
i
would
think
that
this
would
be
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law
because
i
would
think
it
would
be
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law
as
long
as
that
state
assumed
the
obligation
of
educating
person
in
other
place.
this
would
be
my
approach
to
that
problem.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
you
make
my
problem
a
little
more
difficult
when
you
use
this
$300.
if
i
can
answer
it
on
the
assumption
that
this
will
be
a
complete
education
and
i'll
attempt
to
answer,
the
$300
gives
me
problems
because
i
would
take
the
view
of
the
$300
then
that's
not
enough.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
alright.
well
then
--
then
this
--
then
i
think
i
can
answer
though,
at
least
i'll
try
to
answer
in
this
way.
i
would
think
that
this
kind
of
arrangement
which
is
being
arranged
by
the
state
for
all
the
students
and
they
are
not
really
maintaining
public
schools
in
the
traditional
form,
but
they
are
in
fact,
maintaining
public
schools
in
a
different
way.
i
would
think
that
as
long
as
there
is
no
attempt
to
evade,
there's
no
segregation
or
discrimination
in
the
operation
of
this
program
that
is
both
with
respect
to
the
schools
or
in
respect
to
the
admissions
and
so
forth
that
it
might
be
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
would
contend
under
those
circumstances
that
this
is
the
denial
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
would
think
that
the
school,
public
funds,
it
is
our
position
here
that
public
funds
cannot
be
used
by
an
institution
that
although
the
question
of
the
individual
having
a
right
to
go
to
the
school
they
plead,
they
have
no
objection
to
that.
but
if
the
public
funds
in
the
institution
itself
discriminates
and
segregates,
that
is
it
maintains
a
policy
of
exclusion
of
this
the
prince
edward
school
foundation
or
from
negro
institution
that
would
maintain
the
policy
of
inclusion
based
upon
race,
it
would
be
my
view
that
the
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
bar
the
use
of
state
money
and
the
allocation
of
state
money
into
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
both
the
--
the
equal
protection
clause
and
because
of
the
fact
that
this
court
has
indicated
that
education
supported
and
maintained
by
the
state
that
it
cannot
participate
as
i
understand
in
cooper
versus
aaron
in
any
management,
arrangement,
use
of
funds
and
so
forth
to
maintain
the
segregated
school.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it
goes
to
the
child's
parents,
but
it
eventually
goes
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
would
contend
that
this
also
a
part
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
but
the
question
in
the
g.i
bill
of
rights,
if
the
g.i.
bill
of
rights
is
used
and
if
funds,
public
funds
for
the
support
and
maintenance
of
the
school
which
bars
negroes
based
upon
race,
i
would
contend
that
the
funds
cannot
be
used
for
this
purpose
and
this
would
be
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
this
would
be
my
contention.
now
the
fact
that
--
the
fact
that
this
matter
has
not
been
brought
for
adjudication
by
this
court
as
another
matter
and
another
thing,
but
here
we
have,
here
what
i
think
we
would
have
in
your
instance
sir,
you
would
have
a
foundation
or
an
organization
that
is
like
the
prince
edward
school
foundation
totally
supported
and
is
able
to
be
operative
because
of
the
funds
that
it
receives
under
from
this
kind
of
program.
and
i
would
think
that
this
is
an
invasion
of
the
mandate
of
this
court
in
cooper
versus
aaron.
it
would
be
my
view.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
don't
believe
that
the
question
might
come
as
to
whether
how
much
of
the
public
funds
are
being
utilized
whether
this,
by
virtue
of
the
public
funds
that
go
in,
so
whether
this
is
in
fact
the
public
of
institution.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
instance
that
you
have
given
to
me
which
is
apparently
similar
to
the
kind
of
program,
i
think
that
virginia
indicates
that
it
was
attempting
to
set
up,
i
think
that
here,
you
have
the
state
who
is
attempting
to
substitute
for
its
obligation
to
accord
to
persons
without
regard
to
race
the
equality
of
education
opportunities.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
under
these
circumstances
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
must
attach
or
if
it
doesn't
attach
then
i
think
that
evasions
and
frustrations
and
so
forth
can
occur.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
feel
that
although
this
is
not
the
case,
the
same
kind
of
facts
is
in
cooper
versus
aaron.
you
don't
have
the
governor
of
the
state
who
is
using
an
army
to
the
national
guard
to
keep
children
out
of
school
and
you
don't
have
the
--
is
into
position
by
use
of
physical
force
to
frustrate
the
rights
of
negro
children
to
equal
education
opportunities.
you
have
a
more
gentile,
it
seems
to
me
attempt
to
evade
the
constitution.
and
what
is
happening
here
is
that
the
county
board
and
the
board
of
supervisors
made
up
their
minds
that
they
would
not,
that
they
would
not
comply
with
this
court's
order
that
they
would
not
accord
in
prince
edward
county,
they
would
not
operate
any
schools
without
regard
to
race.
and
they
decided
that
they
would
not
do
this
and
they
take
the
view
that
they
are
not
in
defiance
of
this
court's
order
when
they
closed
the
school
term.
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
petitioners
have
their
right
because
they
have
their
rights,
because
they
have
been
declared
in
principle.
now
it's
our
view
that
the
rights
of
equal
protection
and
due
process
which
this
court
enunciated
in
brown
versus
board
of
education
and
in
cooper
versus
aaron
and
in
the
case
from
the
district
of
columbia
that
these
rights
were
expected
to
be
implemented
and
enjoyed
in
realistic,
in
real
life,
that
they
were
not
abstractions,
that
they
were
not
principles,
that
the
persons
could
not
have
and
would
not
enjoy,
that
they're
not
with
legalisms
before
the
court.
now
what
the
court
said
in
brown
versus
the
board
of
education
and
to
be
applied
here,
was
the
fact
that
these
children
in
prince
edward
county
and
negroes
throughout
the
united
states
were
entitled
without
regard
to
discrimination,
without
regard
to
race
or
color
to
have
their
right
to
equal
education
opportunities.
and
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
this
case
were
of
one
of
first
impression
that
there
were
no
law,
no
precedents
in
our
favor,
the
cooper
versus
aaron
and
other
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
this
court
in
--
that
you
can't
frustrate
the
rights
of
the
--
and
you
can't
frustrate
the
orders
of
this
court.
we
would
take
the
view
that
the
importance
of
this
case
is
such
both
in
terms
of
the
federal
system
and
constitutional
rights
of
the
petitioners
and
the
implementation
of
the
constitution
that
we
would
be
in
a
position,
i
think,
to
urge
the
court
to
take
the
step
if
there
were
no
precedent
in
order
to
settle
this
case
and
to
settle
it
favorably.
now
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
point
because,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
think
that
this
case
can
be
decided
on
all
force
with
cooper
versus
aaron.
we
think
that
it
is
a
settlement
of
the
issue.
that
what
this
court
said
in
that
case
can
be
used
to
apply
to
this
case
that
looking
at
these
facts,
looking
at
what
has
been
done.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
want
to
make
in
the
time
left,
several
points.
one,
that
the
state
is
deeply
involved
in
the
--
this
whole
operation
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
but
for
the
fact
that
the
prince
edward
county
closed
the
schools,
the
prince
edward
school
foundation
would
not
be
functioning
and
what
has
really
happened
is
by
virtue
of
its
closing
the
schools,
it
is
responsible
and
directly
responsible
for
the
fact
that
children
are
now
going
to
the
schools.
so
that
i
don't
believe
that
the
state
can
say,
that
in
this
instance,
“we're
innocent
bystanders
and
innocent
parties.
secondly,
we
don't
believe
--
what
we
think
is
clear
is
that
the
schools
were
closed
in
order
to
defeat
and
frustrate,
in
order
not
to
maintain
unsegregated
schools
as
the
constitution
requires.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
don't
believe,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
if
the
whole
state
of
virginia
had
said,
that
it
would
not
run
public
schools
anymore,
i
don't
believe
that
this
would
be
anything
that
they
could
come
here
and
say
that
they
would
be
allowed
to
do.
and
i
don't
think,
one,
i
don't
think
that
they
can
do
it
for
the
reasons
that
they
can't
do
it
in
order
not
to
obey
the
commands
of
the
constitution
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
instance
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
would
think
that,
as
i
attempted
to
answer
the
question
of
mr.
justice
goldberg,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
of
the
maintenance
of
education
for
one
of
the
necessities
of
citizenship
is
it
has
been
not
really
held
by
this
court
to
be
a
duty
on
the
part
of
states,
but
this
court
has
said,
that
it
is
one
of
the
most
vital
functions
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
would
think
that
insofar
as
the
--
that
the
question
of
education
itself
is
concerned,
since
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
one
of
the
matters
and
functions
that
are
essential
for
the
very
process
of
citizenship
--
for
citizenship,
for
us
to
carry
out
our
duties
as
a
citizen.
i
would
think
that
the
state,
an
argument
can
be
made,
the
state
cannot
withdraw
from
the
public
school
system,
but
of
course,
what
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
yes
sir,
but
i
thought
that
in
my
argument
i
had
made
the
point
that
the
schools
were
in
fact
close
for
this
reason
and
i
was
addressing
--
attempting
to
address
myself
to
the
question
where
you
--
that
i
felt
the
court
indicated
to,
is
to
whether
or
not
the
schools
could
be
closed
for
any
reason.
i
think
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
district
judge
found
that
the
schools
were
closed
and
there
is
no
question,
but
that
the
schools
were
closed,
in
order
that
the
board
of
supervisors
would
not
be
required
to
operate
schools
in
which
negro
and
white
children
were
educated
together.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
i
don't
believe
that
i
can
say
to
the
court
that
that
was
the
finding.
the
court
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
insofar
as
the
argument
that
we're
presenting,
we
think
that
the
state
has
function
and
operated
to
this
extent
that
the
state
has,
after
the
1955
and
in
terms
of
its
so-called
massive
resistance
which
we
program,
which
we
presented
in
our
brief,
did
amend
the
tuition
grant
law,
did
or
permit
and
allow
this
operation
of
the
schools
on
the
local
basis.
and
in
fact,
it
does
seem
to
us,
in
terms
of
this,
that
what
has
happened
is
that
the
state
was
making
it
possible
in
terms
of
its
amendments
to
its
laws
for
local
counties
to
decide
for
themselves
whether
they
wanted
to
abide
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
state
itself,
since
the
school
closing
law
was
declared
unconstitutional
in
james
v.
bowman,
has
enacted
laws
apparently
to
leave
this
matter
to
the
local
parties.
now
we
feel
that
what
really
is
happening
in
this
case
is
that
the
prince
edward
county,
prince
edward
county
has
said
“we'll
close
the
schools
rather
than
have
schools
operating
and
functioning.”
we
say
to
the
court
that
this
cannot
be
done,
that
this
is
the
state
is
operating,
the
state
is
functioning
and
that
the
state
is
required
to
obey
and
abide
by
the
constitution,
that
the
schools
cannot
be
closed.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
the
constitution
may
not
--
if
the
constitution
doesn't
compel
every
state
to
run
public
schools,
it
does
compel
them
to
not
to
abandon
public
schools
in
order
to
defeat
the
constitutional
rights
of
persons
which
have
been
declared
by
this
court.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
on
the
basis
of
the
denial
of
equal
protection,
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
it
is
our
view
that
insofar
as
the
state
is
concerned,
that
the
state
of
virginia,
that
the
people
in
prince
edward
county,
from
whatever
source
the
closing
of
the
schools
came,
that
the
people
in
prince
edward
county,
the
children
in
prince
edward
county
are
being
denied
equal
protection
of
the
laws
because
virginia
is
deeply
involved
in
running
and
operating
the
school
system
throughout
the
study.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
justice
goldberg,
my
problem
is
of
course
in
terms
of
time
and
i
have
no
need
really
to
make
the
broad
argument
and
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
–
and
i
think
in
order
to
present
this
case,
and
i
am
--
time
is
pressing
close
off
upon
the
terms
--
by
attempting
to
make
the
other
arguments
i
wanted
to
make.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
i
do
believe
that
insofar
as
the
narrow
question
before
this
court
in
which
i
believe
that
this
case
can
be
determined
on
one,
is
on
the
basis
of
the
reasons
why
these
schools
were
closed,
the
reasons
why
they're
not
operating,
and
the
basis
upon
which
the
prince
edward
county
and
the
state
took
its
position.
well
it
seems
to
me,
that
on
that
--
that
there's
no
question,
but
that
there
has
been
a
denial
and
frustration
right.
i
think
that
the
tuition
grant
program
which
has
been
--
and
the
state
scholarship
program
that
they
can
be
enjoined
and
should
be
enjoined
as
long
as
they
are
utilized
for
the
support
of
education
and
institutions
that
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
the
color.
i
think
insofar
as
the
release
is
concerned,
that
there
should
no
question
and
no
problem
in
regard
to
relief
because
the
court
has
before
it
the
parties,
who
are
the
principal
parties
to
this
action.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
relief
we're
asking
for
is
that
the
county
board
be
required
to
levy
taxes,
sufficient
and
appropriate
funds
sufficient
to
reopen
the
public
schools
in
prince
edward
county
on
a
nonsegregated
basis.
and
that
the
county
board
of
education
be
required
to
make
plan
for
the
admission
of
people
on
a
nonsegregated
basis
effective,
we
hope
by
september,
1954
and
that
the
state
be
required
--
state
officials
be
required
to
do
all
that
they
must
do
under
--
in
order
that
the
schools
will
be
opening
and
functioning
by
september,
1954
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
1964.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
i
say
the
other
as
well.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
would
say
the
other
as
well,
yes
sir,
because
i
think
that
you
can't
--
that
there
is
no
valid
or
rational
basis,
it
seems
to
me,
upon
which
in
view
of
the
importance
of
education,
upon
which
this
court
could
sustain
a
local
option
which
would
permit
some
parts
of
the
state
to
deny
or
not
have
the
children
education
in
other
parts
to
have
them.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
i
don't
feel
it's
essential
to
my
case
but
i
do
feel
that
in
terms
of
the
reach
and
the
reach
of
this
which
i
think
that
this
issue
is
presenting,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
can
bring
before
this
court,
this
case
showing
the
schools
were
closed.
but
the
importance
of
this
case,
in
terms
of
that
principle
in
regard
to
the
full
implementation
of
brown
versus
the
board
of
education,
it
makes
it
vital
it
seems
to
me
that
the
local
option
on
the
broad
basis
the
that
suggested
that
the
local
option
also
be
held
to
be
unconstitutional.
i
think
that,
to
the
reach,
in
other
words,
there
may
well
be
a
case
where
it's
not
as
clear
that
the
schools
were
closed
to
avoid
segregation.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir.
there
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir.
