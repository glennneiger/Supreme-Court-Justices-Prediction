stewart
they
voluntarily
offer
for
discontinuing
practice,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
purchase
alone
violated
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
a
purchase
and
the
sale
at
a
loss,
or
a
half-a-dozen
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
a
generally
falling
market
it
might
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well
how
about
–
what
is
the
answer
to
my
question?
justice
potter
stewart
might
be
quite
another
basis,
he
might
be
holding
himself
out
as
an
expert
advisor
and
be
a
very
--
and
be
an
incompetent
one
to
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
who
would
be
defrauded
in
either
case,
in
either
case
of
profit
or
a
loss
who
would
be
the
persons
–
who
are
the
people
defrauded,
when
you
have
frauds
somebody
has
to
be
defrauded.
justice
potter
stewart
how
are
they
defrauded?
justice
potter
stewart
now
on
this
preliminary
injunction
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
very
careful
to
limit
the
question
it
was
deciding
and
that
was
whether
or
not
a
preliminary
injunction
was
justified
or
whether
this
section
had
no
way
to
development
to
approve
but
a
trial
on
the
preliminary
injunction
i
understand
that
there
was
no
indication
of
these
people
were
not
getting
bona
fide
honest
advice.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
conflict?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
ferber,
the
basic
purpose
of
this
act
was
to
create
such
condition
as
would
ensure
that
the
clients
and
investment
advisor
service
was
given
the
best
recommendation
of
the
advisor.
is
there
any
allegation
or
finding
in
this
case
that
the
best
recommendation
of
the
advisor
was
not
given?
justice
potter
stewart
with
respect
to
this
jury
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
an
allegation
in
this
case
or
any
finding
of
any
actual
conflict
of
interest?
justice
potter
stewart
you
gave
us
a
couple
of
imaginary
cases,
is
there
any
allegation
of
any
such
data,
facts
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
allegation
or
finding
in
this
case
that
the
--
any
of
the
clients
of
this
respondent
suffered
any
loss?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
that
is
what
you
said,
it's
obviously
speculative
but
whether
or
not
they
suffered
any
loss
is
a
matter
of
fact.
justice
potter
stewart
a
long-term.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
fennelly
before
you
sit
down,
is
there
any
indication
in
this
case
what
if
any
other
securities
the
respondent
was
buying
or
selling
during
this
period?
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
is
man,
this
capital
gains
research
bureau
incorporated
was
the
--
obviously
in
the
business
of,
as
an
investment
advisor,
it
was
wholly
owned
by
mr.
schwarzmann
i
guess,
or
wholly
owned
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
schwarzmann
also
an
investor
on
his
own
behalf
in
another,
in
other
words
i
think
it's
possible,
it
occurs
to
me
that
we
might
have
one
case
if
these
were
the
only
securities
he
bought
and
sold
and
perhaps
conceivably
quite
a
different
case
if
he
brought
and
sold
a
100
others
during
over
this
period
of
a
year
which,
that
the
securities
which
could
did
figure
in
any
of
his
investment
advice.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
one
way
or
the
other,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
then
shall
what
--
how
many
other
stocks
he
bought
or
sold?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
some
mentioned
in
the
brief
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
other,
other
investment
advisory
services
were
also
recommending
some
or
all
of
these
securities
in
the
same
period,
are
those
facts
developed
or
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
that,
that
recommendation,
recommendation
had
been
made
before
the
respondent
purchased
union
pacific?
justice
potter
stewart
the
purchase.
justice
potter
stewart
and
did
capital,
and
was
that
one
of
those
which
was
purchased
and
later
sold?
justice
potter
stewart
by
capital
gains?
justice
potter
stewart
well
when
did
the
purchase
come
with
reference
to
the
other
advisory
services'
recommendation?
justice
potter
stewart
so
assuming
that
there
is
a
short-term
immediate
rise
in
a
security
after
a
large
advisory
service
recommended
that
rise
presumably
would
have
already
occurred
at
the
time
that
the
respondent
bought
--
that
rise
is
attributable
to
the
other
advisory
services
recommendation
would
have
already
occurred
at
the
time
the
respondent
bought
union
pacific
is
that
right,
that's
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
this
service
did
not
purport
to
advise
before
when
to
sell
i
suppose
did
it
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
basically
it
was
a,
it
was
a
service
covering
a
recommend
purchases
for
long-term
appreciation?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
didn't,
didn't
make
sell
recommendations,
the
acceptance
of
(inaudible)
comparing
one
purchase
with
another
purchase.
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
ask
you
this
from
a
tax
point
of
view,
would
it
have
made
any
difference
to
this
respondent,
whether
he
held
a
security
from
six
months
or
longer
or
less
than
six
months
would
he
have
been
taxed,
would
this
not
--
any
profits
on
this
have
been
taxable
and
is
ordinary
income
in
any
event
or
doesn't
that
show
in
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
so
to
him
it
was
a
kind
of
him
own
point
of
view
of
--
his
own
tax
consequences
as
the
taxpayers,
it
didn't
make
any
difference
whether
he
is
on
the
security
for
six
months
or
longer,
for
less
than
six
months.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
don't
ask
you
to
make
a
confession.
i
don't
know
if
there
is
any
internal
revenue
agent
in
the
room,
but
it's
just,
it's
just
one
of
the
things
that
--
i
want
to
know
if
there
is
any,
if
there
is
any
evidence
one
way
or
the
other
on
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
any
of
that
sort
in
the
record,
alright.
