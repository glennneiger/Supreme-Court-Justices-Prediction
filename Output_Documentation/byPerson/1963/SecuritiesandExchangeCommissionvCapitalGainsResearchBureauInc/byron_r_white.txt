if
an

let
me
ask
you
this
before
you
do
if
he
purchase,
he
has
known
the
securities
for
years
but
he
does
purchase
after
he
has
made
up
the
fact
that
he
has
or
not
even
decided
on
what
his
advice
is
going
to
be
or
after
--
or
at
least
he
didn't
intend
to
buy
(inaudible)
but
after
he
had
made
up
his
mind
what
his
advice
is
going
to
be
he
never
does
that
(inaudible)
justice

white
and
if
he
--
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
advisor
buy
and
sell
in
his
own
name?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
wasn't
--
at
least

mean
the
corporation
was
revealed
in
the
(inaudible)
it
wasn't
held
in
discrete
name
or
anything
like
that?
justice
byron

but
other
broker
dealers
might
know

justice
byron

white
that
broker
dealer
would
know
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
this
case
to
assume
that
he
does
have
this
intent,
are
you
attacking
the
findings
here
that
there
was
an
attempt
to
sell
as
many
times?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right
let's
assume
that
there
is
intent
to
sell
at
an
early
time
and
without
any
questions,
if
he
buys
them,
plans
to
sell
at
an
early
date,
let's
accept
that
for
the
moment,
do
you
think
that
is
a
matter
that
should
be
explored?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
the
facts
that
they
are
going
to
be
early
selling
operations
in
the
recommended
stock,
in

especially
by
the
one
advising
(inaudible),
would
be
a
subsequent

justice
byron

then
they
might
not
have
harmed.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
might
have
an
effect
of
market
i
suppose
to
a
fellow
who
recommended
the
stock
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
starts
selling
what
he
owns?
