mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
mr.
justice
warren,
justices
of
the
court.
this
case
started
in
november
1960
on
an
application
for
a
preliminary
injunction
and
no
effort
has
ever
been
made
to
try
the
case
on
the
merits.
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
no
fraud
and
no
intent.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
recommendations
that
the
investment
advisor
made
were
sound
and
indeed
in
the
instances
complained
of
anyone
who
had
followed
his
advice
for
long-term
gain
has
the
opportunity
to
profit
from
34%
to
84%.
now
what
is
complained
of
is
that
after
the
investment
advisor
had
investigated
a
stock
and
had
decided
to
recommend
it
to
customers,
he
himself
before
he
sent
out
his
recommendation
bought
some
shares
and
in
the
six
instances
complained
of,
they
are
small
shares
compared
to
the
outstanding
stock
of
the
company
is
involved.
one
company
creole
has
an
issue
of
77
million
shares,
the
man
bought
600.
nowhere
do
they
claim
that
his
advice
was
not
good.
now
assuming
that
he
had
bought
no
shares,
would
it
not
be
equally
argued
by
the
commission
that
here
is
an
advisor
who
recommends
stock
and
does
not
follow
his
own
advice?
and
suppose
of
buying
600
shares,
suppose
he
bought
one
is
there
a
conflict
of
interest
created?
is
the
integrity
of
his
advice
changed?
the
real
test
is
whether
this
man
was
honest
and
was
giving
his
subscribers
the
opportunity
to
purchase
for
a
long-term
gain
which
on
the
facts
proved
to
be
100%
correct.
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
well
justice
goldberg
it
would
seem
to
me
that
where
a
man
studies,
and
these
are
the
facts
of
this
case,
where
he
studies
his
stock
and
decides
to
ride
on
it
because
he
buys
some
shares,
it
does
not
change
his
--
make
him
interested
instead
of
disinterested.
it
is
not
a
situation
where
a
--
someone
owns
a
big
block
of
stock
that
they
want
to
get
rid
of.
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
i
think
that's
true
and
i
do
not
think
that
because
he
buys
a
share
and
follows
his
own
advice
that
he
alters
his
disinterestedness
because
the
--
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
do
i
say
nominal?
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
dominant
position,
no.
it
would
depend
--
it
would
depend
on
his
intent.
certainly
if
a
man
owned
a
block
of
stock
and
those
are
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
and
their
motive
and
reason
for
recommending
it
is
to
unload
that
stock
onto
the
public,
i
mean
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
about
it,
but
where
a
man
in
good
faith
studies
his
stock,
finds
an
undervalued,
recommends
to
the
public
because
he
too
seeks
to
share
on
his
own
work
product
which
i
think
is
the
back
concept
that
we
must
decide
whether
a
man
who
works
on
this,
whether
he
hasn't
had
a
right
to
use
his
own
work
product.
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
well,
i
would
think
not
your
honor.
these
are
a
(inaudible)
and
whether
or
not
he
would
intend
to
sell
that
stock
before
it
goes
out
one
week,
two
weeks,
if
the
stock
went
down
he
might
decide
to
hold
it
and
the
ultimate
belief
that
his
long-term
--
his
advice
for
a
long-term
gain
would
prove
correct
and
that
the
stock
would
rise.
i
do
not
think
that
he
would
in
a
position
to
say
i
intend
to
sell
in
one
week
or
two
weeks.
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
i
don't
think
there
is
any
such
finding
your
honor,
i
think
those
are
facts,
that
what
happened
that
he
did.
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
no,
i
would
not
think
so.
i
would
not
think
so.
and
for
the
reason
--
for
the
reason
is
that
what
his
advice
is
that
they
buy
for
long-term
gain
not
what
he
does
in
fact
had
they
sold
for
long-term
gain,
not
what
he
does.
in
fact
had
they
sold
for
long-term
gain
they
would
have
made
a
very
small
profit.
whereas
if
they
followed
his
advice,
they
would
have
made
a
profit
not
with
what
he
was
trying
to
tell
them
to
do.
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
it
would
--
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
would
have
done
no
harm.
it
is
--
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
it
was
--
then
they
would,
they
would
have
been
harmed
by
not
buying.
it
seems
to
me
exactly
like
a
doctor
who
recommends
that
his
patient
do
not
smoke
at
all,
and
the
doctor
himself
smokes
a
carton
a
day.
i
would
--
the
doctor's
advice
could
be
a
complete
good
faith
having
nothing
to
do
with
his
own
preference
for
tobacco,
but
he
honestly
believes
that
it
is
bad
for
his
patients.
and
i
don't
think
that
a
doctor's
integrity
should
be
impugned
because
something
that
he
himself
does
having
nothing
to
do
really
with
the
patient.
and
in
this
case
looking
at
the
advisors
transactions
wholly
apart
from
a
view
of
integrity
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
subscribers,
as
subscribers
he
was
telling
purchase
for
long-term
gain.
and
to
be
sure
if
this
advice,
his
judgment
was
correct
sooner
or
later
the
stocks
should
rise,
which
they
did,
and
of
course
he
elects
for
one
reason
or
another
not
to
have
the
profit
for
the
long-term
period
but
sells
out
at
a
short
period,
does
not
in
any
way
affect
either
the
integrity
of
the
advise
nor
the
intent
with
which
it
is
given.
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
your
honor
these
--
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
your
honor
the
shares,
these
involve
--
millions
of
shares
there
was
only
one
instance
where
you
have
less
than
a
million
shares
out
that
was
hart,
schaffner
&
marx
where
they
was
an
issue
of
some
800,000
shares.
and
in
that
issue
specifically
in
his
bulletin
he
told
the
people
do
not
reach
for
these
stocks,
buy
them
at
a
level
because
the
buying
might
tend
to
increase
market.
his
advice
was
completely
with
integrity,
because
he
specifically
told
them
at
that
instance
not
to
reach
for
them
to
put
it
out.
so
that
there
was
no
intention
which
the
district
court
found
and
circuit
court
has
found
of
anything
but
good
intent.
now
the
commission
admits
that
if
he
had
purchased
the
stock
and
held
that
for
long-term
gain
himself,
there
would
be
no
need
of
disclosure
and
nothing
fraudulent.
well
suppose
instead
of
holding
it
for
six
months
he
purchases
the
stock
and
holds
it
for
five
months
and
29
days
then
we
have
a
adulteration
of
integrity
or
the
soundness
of
advice
can
it
become
fraudulent
for
a
difference
of
a
day,
suppose
he
sells
it
five
months,
four
months.
that
is
not
the
test.
the
test
is
what
they
advise
was
honest
and
whether
he
was
giving
that
advice
with
good
intent
and
on
the
affidavit
on
information
and
belief
submitted
in
this
record
there
was
no
basis
for
a
preliminary
injunction
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
writ
should
be
dismissed
or
a
judgment
affirmed.
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
no,
your
honor
there
is
a
11-month
period
set
out
in
the
complaint
and
they
have
alleged
that
in
six
instances
both
went
out
every
month
and
that
is
all
that
is
in
the
complaint
and
moving
papers.
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
it
was
wholly
owned.
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
yes
the
affidavit
alleges
that
on
certain
instances
wholly
apart
in
bulletin
he
had
purchased
and
sold
some
of
the
same
stock.
it
may
have
nothing
to
do
with
any
recommendation.
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
no,
no
it
doesn't
do
that.
i
think
two
instances
in
the
papers
hart,
schaffner
&
marx
and
i
think
chock
full
o'nuts
where
he
alleges
in
his
affidavit
that
wholly
apart
from
any
bulletin
he
had
transactions
in
the
stock.
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
prior
to
that
term.
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
they
are
developed
slightly
in
our
papers.
your
honor,
you'll
understand
that
we
had
to
answer
these
papers
at
the
time
and
the
facts
that
we
did
know
was
for
example
union
pacific
has
been
recommended
10
days
before
capital
gains
by
standards
statistics
which
is
the
largest
advisory
service
in
the
united
states.
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
yes,
your
honor
it
was
10
days
before
--
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
that
was
10
days
before
capital
gain
issued
its
bulletin
recommending
it.
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
yes,
yes.
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
yes.
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
i
would
say
five
days.
i
maybe
--
i
would
say
about
five
days
after
standard
statistics
and
about
five
days
before
capital
gains
issued
its
recommendation.
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
well
my
view,
i
am
certain
that
i
understand
your
question,
my
view
is
that
that
if
his
advice
was
correct
that
the
market
should
raise,
i
mean
over
a
period
of
time,
i
mean
not
necessarily
today,
now
the
record
show
that
union
pacific
did
raise,
maybe
pointed
to
him
and
gradually
went
up,
so
that
ultimately
what
he
had
recommended
to
his
people
was
completely
correct.
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
no,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
on
here
as
to
these
stocks
in
the
moving
papers,
this
happened
in
a
short
period
of
time
in
a
complaint
application
for
injunction
our
answering
papers,
so
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
about
that
whatsoever.
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
that's
right.
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
whatsoever
about
any
selling
recommendation.
one
reason
would
be
that
the
--
it
happened
at
a
period
when
that
could
not
have
been
possible
with
relation
to
these
securities.
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
it
does
not
show
in
the
record.
that
would
be
my
belief.
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
well
as
to
him
personally
i
would
think
not,
perhaps
the
corporation
although
it
is
--
i
don't
think
i
should
be
so
certain
about
that,
because
the
business
of
capital
gains
actually
is
an
advisory
service
and
this
was
incidental
business
to
it
and
the
bureau
could
well
hold
--
it
would
not
in
the
course
of
their
business
and
therefore
tax
--
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
there
is
no
evidence.
mr.
leo
c.
fennelly
no
evidence
on
that.
