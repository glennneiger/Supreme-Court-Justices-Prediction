justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
to
have
the
judgment
rendered
against
you
available
for
use
under
5
(a)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
arbitrary
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
â€“
is
not
that
the
basic
objection
you
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
understand
that.
but
are
you
calling
it
arbitrary
then
for
the
government,
to
come
in
and
say,
"well,
the
government
is
also
interested
in
5
(a),
it's
a
part
of
the
system
setup
but
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
act,
we
insist
that
we
be
allowed
to
obtain
an
adjudication."
and
you
say,
they
shall
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
in
fact
what
it
is,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
depends
on
--
and
you
say
it's
arbitrary
for
the
government
to
take
position
that
in
the
interest
of
the
general
enforcement
of
antitrust
laws,
it
has
a
right
to
have
an
adjudication
so
that
5
(a)
will
be
available
to
other
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
--
why
would
there
be
any
difference
in
this
one
and
others?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
--
i'm
talking
about
this
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
that
--
what
difference
does
that
make,
if
they
have
a
right
to
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
waive
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
--
now
what
--
what
the
government
is
insisting
on,
as
i
understand
it,
i
had
a
little
difficulty
in
trying
to
reaching
it
but
i
think
is
the
issue
and
what's
behind
it.
the
government
wants
a
judgment
that
on
which,
private
litigants
can
depend
in
case
they
sue
for
civil
damages.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
want
them
to
have
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
government
--
it's
arbitrary
in
your
view
for
the
government
to
take
the
position
that
it
wants
a
judgment,
wants
to
go
far
enough
to
get
a
judgment
that
will
adjudicate
guilt.
and
you
take
the
position
that
you
do
not
want
to
go
far
enough
to
adjudicate
guilt
and
you
say,
you
have
a
right
to
do
that
and
it's
arbitrary
for
the
government
to
insist
the
other
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
like
it
had
precisely
the
opposite
effects.
i
don't
quite
understand
that
argument.
what
you're
saying
is
that
a
litigant
if
it
--
enjoined
to
the
court
with
the
government
say,
"we're
not
going
to
let
you
hear
this
case.
we
confess
everything
but
we
won't
have
an
adjudication
against
this
of
guilt.
and
we
thereby
defeat
the
purpose
of
congress
to
make
judgments
available
for
the
use
of
private
litigants."
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
one
of
them,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then,
why
do
you
object
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
would
it
hurt
your
company?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
hurt
your
company?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
you
are
--
you
are
saying
about
a
consent
judgment,
the
government
doesn't
want
it.
the
government
insists
that
it
wants
an
adjudication.
now,
it
--
do
you
get
any
further
than
this
--
than
this,
you
claim
and
maybe
right,
you
claim
that
this
exempts
from
5
(a),
consent
judgment
which
are
adjudications
of
guilt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
provision
of
5
(a)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
claim
the
right
to
go
in
there
and
get
a
judgment
entered
against
you
in
such
a
way
that
5
(a)
will
not
be
applicable
and
the
government
says
it
doesn't
think
you
have
that
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
whole
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what's
the
other
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
are.
if
they
have
a
right
to
do
it,
what's
wrong
with
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
statute
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
say
anything
about
arbitrary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
statute
use
that
term?
what
way
is
it
arbitrary
for
the
government
to
do
this
if
it
has
a
right
to
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
didn't
have
to
let
them
use
it
was
a
lever
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
more
than
the
other
half?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
let
me
just
--
let
me
first
suggest
it
and
by
whom
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
was
that
after
the
act
was
passed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
there
come
up
any
--
had
there
come
up
any
issue
about
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
any
defendant
ever
done
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
any
defendant
ever
done
it
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
was
the
first
lawyer
that
suggested
the
--
of
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
first.
i'm
thinking
