justice
john

can
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
the
scope
for
the
relief
had
not
been
called
in
question,
in
other
words,
that
the
broadened
relief
that
the
government
wanted
had
been
consented
to
oppose.
and
there
--
then
the
only
issue
was
whether
or
not
the
--
the
presumption
following
from
a
decree
after
trial
that's
available
in
a
treble
damage
suit
was
the
issue,
would
the
government
then
have
had
a
right
to
insist
under
trial
to
give
effect
to
that
presumptive
effect
of
the
decree
after
trial?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
i'm
wondering
whether
the
real
issue
here
isn't
that
question
rather
than
the
scope
of
the
relief.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
i
realize
that.
