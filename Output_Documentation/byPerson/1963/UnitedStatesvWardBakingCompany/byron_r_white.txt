justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
offer
to
prove
them
in
connection
with
the
--
with
the
action
that
the
court
took
or
did
you
offer
to
prove
them
only
if
a
trial
took
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
says
that
--
that
says
it
would
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
says
it
would
be
afforded
the
opportunity.
that
doesn't
say
that
it
has
facts
and
it
doesn't
--
isn't
an
offer
to
--
and
--
and
didn't
the
government
--
did
the
government
refuse
in
connection
with
the
court's
action
to
submit
the
facts
that
it
had
prior
to
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
--
by
the
government
to
give
these
facts
to
the
court
to
show
that
the
court's
proposed
action
was
incorrect?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
kind
of
--
what
(inaudible)
is
that?
i
mean
what
--
what
are
the
facts
that
--
that
you're
really
disputing
in
connection
with
relief?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
no
dispute
about
those
basic
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
dispute
about
those
basic
facts
which
you've
just
recited.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
understand
that.
but
the
disputed
fact
is
what
i'm
really
concerned
about.
didn't
the
appellee
--
the
defendant
didn't
dispute
those
facts
about
the
price
fixing,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
fact
that
it
has
been
found
guilty
if
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
--
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
--
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
an
answer
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
he
--
did
--
a
general
denial?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
the
pretrial
proceedings,
they
didn't
admit
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
and
the
trial
court
concede
the
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
there's
some
area
between
consent
judgment
and
a
--
and
an
adjudication
which
the
court
may
impose
upon
the
government
and
yet
not
--
not
the
prima
facie
evidence
in
civil
--
in
private
actions?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
was
somehow
never
appealed,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
an
adjudication.
justice
byron
r.
white
adjudication
(inaudible)
in
circumstances,
i
mean,
you
weren't
--
you
weren't
ready
to
come
in
here
and
say
judge,
you
enter
an
adjudication
against
us
on
the
fact.
we
consent
to
all
the
facts.
you
enter
a
--
you
entered
a
judgment
against
us
concluding
that
we
violated
the
antitrust
laws
and
then
entered
a
narrow
injunction.
you
weren't
willing
to
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
we
would
have
a
different
issue
here
if
the
court
had
entered
an
adjudication
of
guilt
but
then
entered
the
narrow
decree
which
you
wanted.
we
would
have
a
completely
different
case
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
wouldn't
--
you're
the
--
be
the
one
who
was
appealing
from
something
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
maybe
completely
correct,
you
maybe
completely
correct
in
what
you
say
up
to
the
point
that
the
court
is
entitled,
not
only
to
enter
the
narrow
relief
but
to
avoid
an
adjudication.
i
mean,
there
could
be
--
it
could
be
that
you're
absolutely
true
that
the
government
was
trying
to
get
broader
relief
than
it
was
entitled
to.
but
that's
no
excuse
for
saying
that
there
shouldn't
be
an
adjudication
in
the
--
in
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
--
the
government,
you
could
be
protected
against
simply
by
going
to
trial,
i
suppose.
i
mean,
if
you
are
right,
you
go
to
trial
and
you
--
you
win
the
case
or
lose
it.
if
you
lose
it,
then
you
have
a
problem
about
relief.
and
if
the
government
asked
for
relief
to
which
it
wasn't
entitled,
it
wouldn't
get
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
government
simply
adopted
a
policy
of
--
for
--
say
that
for
a
year,
they
were
going
to
--
they
were
going
to
be
no
consent
decrees
whatsoever?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
be
coming
--
would
that
--
could
judges
force
them
to
take
a
decree?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
any
authority
for
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
brunswick-balke
is
the
first
time
the
court
ever
did
that,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
brunswick-balke
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
there
weren't
other
ones?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
the
--
that
the
power
just
like
this
would
be
as
--
the
defendant
and
the
government
is
negotiating
back
--
they're
no
--
they're
not
getting
back
and
forth
on
a
consent
decree.
and
you
walk
out
for
the
--
in
negotiations
and
the
trial
judge
imposed
a
con
--
so-called
"consent
decree"
upon
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you're
being
arbitrary?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
he
have
to
do
is
say
"you're
arbitrary
--
justice
byron
r.
white
"you're
arbitrary
in
--
in
refusing
this
scope
of
relief
and
--
and
i've
--
i
have
the
discretion
to
make
you
take
this
consent
decree."
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
if
the
judge
got
that
far
and
said
there
was
no
triable
issues
and
said,
you
were
arbitrary
in
refusing
this
kind
of
a
consent
decree,
and
of
course,
he
could,
i
suppose,
only
he
could
invite
the
government
to
file
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
having
a
summary
judgment
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
against
you
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
enter
the
relief
he
wanted
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
one
more
question,
i
suppose
the
--
that
the
--
if
you
had
wanted
to
know
what
facts
the
government
had
about
any
part
of
the
case,
the
discovery
procedures
were
available
to
--
to
give
those
facts
to
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
question
that
the
--
there's
no
question
but
what
the
judge,
if
you
had
--
if
the
government
had
refused
discovery
as
to
facts,
there's
no
question
there,
lot's
of
sanctions
in
the
rules
to
either
force
the
government
to
produce
the
facts
or
have
this
case
dismissed,
is
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
government
said
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
