justice
tom
c.

what
(inaudible)?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
understand
that.
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
was
the
issue,
(inaudible)
by
the
government
--
to
the
government
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
is
that
right?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
all
the
facts
were
admitted
i
suppose.
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
only
thing
they
didn't
wish
was
to
have
the
injunctive
features
of
the
relief
vested
against
them
as
--
insofar
as
public
sales
was
concerned.

to
go
into
trial
and
we'd
assume
that
you
only
prove
your
allegations,
that
is
sales
against
--
sales
to
the
government.
it's
your
position
that
you'd
been
entitled
to
the
broader
injunction
nevertheless.
justice
tom
c.
clark
a
strange
procedure
but
i
wanted
if
it
--
couldn't
be
entered?
now
just
to
perhaps
to
summary
judgment
or
something,
a
kind
of
motion.
you
don't
have
any
conflictive
facts
from
what
you
say,
i
gather.
all
you're
claiming
is
rigged
sales
to
the
government.
they
come
in,
they
say,
"yes,
we
rigged
sales
to
the
government."
so
they
filed
a
motion
and
they
say
they
want
a
summary
judgment
i
suppose.
they
don't
say
that
in
their
motion
but
they
say
they
want
their
decree
entered.
justice
tom
c.
clark
it
can't
be
tantamount
of
a
guilty
plea?
justice
tom
c.
clark
(voice

treble
damage
suit.
justice
tom
c.
clark
just
suppose
they
said
no,
(inaudible)
agreed
to
the
consent
decree
on
(inaudible)
could
that
be
such
arbitrating
if
the
court
could
require
him
to
agree?
justice
tom
c.
clark
require
him
to
agree,
even
though
they
said,
"(inaudible)
in
the
file.
(inaudible)
i'm
not
going
to
enter
any
consent
decree
with
you."
get
ready
for
trial.
the
courts
turns
on
them
and
say,
"you
aren't
going
to
enter
a
consent
decree."
