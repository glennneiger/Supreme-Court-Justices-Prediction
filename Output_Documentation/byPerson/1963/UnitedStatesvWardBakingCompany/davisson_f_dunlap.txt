mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
make
a
few
statements
in
regard
to
the
facts
before,
if
i
may,
before
we
get
into
the
law.
i
take
issue
with
my
friend,
mr.
orrick,
on
what
--
how
this
got
before
the
court.
it's
very
clear
that
after
there
was
a
pretrial
hearing,
at
which
this
dispute
between
the
government
and
the
private
parties
was
outlined
and
the
affidavit
was
filed
outlining
these
procedures
to
give
the
court
the
factual
background.
at
that
hearing,
the
government
tendered
a
proposed
judgment
and
so
did
the
appellees.
and
at
that
hearing,
the
government
--
the
court
issued
a
rule
nisi
which
told
in
effect
to
the
government,
"if
you've
got
any
proof,
if
you've
got
any
legal
--
any
points
about
that
i
don't
have
power,
bring
them
in."
and
what
did
the
government
do?
the
government
absolutely
did
not
file
anything
showing
that
they
had
any
facts.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
although
mr.
orrick
said
they
didn't
refuse
to
in
effect
they
did.
and
they
took
this
position,
and
i
call
this
to
your
attention,
it
was
in
the
brief
filed
after
the
last
hearing
in
june,
in
the
record
on
page
122
in
their
brief
filed
in
july
of
1962,
and
this
is
a
position
they
took.
the
defendants
here
argued,
if
the
government
had
admissible
evidence
going
beyond
the
facts
plead,
showing
a
legal
need
for
broader
relief
then
it
should
have
set
this
out
specifically
in
answer
to
the
rule
nisi.
but
the
simple
answer
to
this
argument
is
that
the
government
was
under
no
duty
to
reveal
all
of
its
evidence
and
answer
to
the
rule
nisi.
it
didn't
reveal
any
evidence
that
it
had
any.
they've
consistently
taken
the
position
that
the
court
didn't
have
power
to
act.
and
as
i
see
it,
and
i'll
go
into
this
a
little
bit
later,
that
if
you
follow
their
position
to
its
logical
extreme,
you
have
here
the
government
saying,
"you
don't
have
power
to
act
to
see
if
your
actions
are
arbitrary
because
you
don't
have
a
record.
and
we're
not
going
to
give
you
the
facts
to
give
you
the
record,
therefore,
you
don't
have
power
to
act",
which
i
think
is
an
erosion
of
the
district
court's
judicial
power
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
action
is
arbitrary.
we
didn't
ask
them
to
show
all
the
facts.
all
they
wanted
to
show
was
facts
that
would
show
there
was
a
triable
issue
on
this
question
of
relief.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
justice
stewart,
the
brunswick-balke
case
which
preceded
this,
which
i'm
sure
the
court
is
familiar,
deleted
the
word
"consent".
i
don't
conceive
of
it
as
a
consent
decree.
i
think
judge
goldberg's
point
is
well
taken.
that's
hard
to
see
how
you
have
a
consent
without
the
consent
of
both
parties.
but
the
fact
is
that,
this
is
a
decree
that
we
say
is
entered
under
the
equity
power
of
the
court
and
also
permitted
under
rule
83
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
but
if
you
go
back
to
the
strict
definition
of
consent
decree,
i
would
not
say
so.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
that
says
that
the
district
court
can
make
rules
if
they
--
as
long
as
they're
not
inconsistent
with
the
other
rules
and
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
i'll
tell
you
mr.
dabney
in
63
columbia
law
review
in
his
article
published
last
year
on
this
very
case,
went
into
that
point
very
thoroughly
and
that
was
a
position
he
took
at
that
time
which
i
think
is
a
sound
position.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
no,
i
think
here
they
are.
i
--
i
think
they
are.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
well,
it
also
provides,
justice
goldberg,
it
applies
to
judgments
entered
before
evidence
is
taken.
now,
there's
some
controversy
as
to
whether
the
--
the
additional
language
what
it
modifies.
but
mr.
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
judge
goldberg,
5
(a)
provides
in
relevant
part
that
a
final
judgment
or
decree
to
the
effect
that
the
defendant
of
--
of
--
has
violated
the
antitrust
law
shall
be
prima
facie
evidence.
and
therefore,
since
it
contains
no
adjudication
and
it's
violated
the
antitrust
laws,
therefore,
we
feel
it
falls
within
that
--
that
language.
that's
the
point
i
was
reading
from
columbia
law
review
of
mr.
dabney's
point.
so,
we
say
that
this
presents
a
very
serious
question.
yes,
sir?
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
yes,
sir,
our
motion
and
the
judge
also,
in
his
order,
says
that
i
am
entering
this
decree
as
if
the
defendants
had
pleaded
pro
confesso
to
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
now,
out
of
fairness
in
that,
justice
white,
i
must
say,
the
only
disputed
issue
i
know
that
would
remain
with
the
pose
would
be
the
adjudication
of
guilt.
but
all
of
the
factual
issues
other
than
the
adjudication
of
guilt
for
the
purposes
of
relief,
it
was
entered
as
if
that
there
were
pro
confesso
in
determining
the
scope
of
the
relief.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
i
think
so,
your
--
your
honor.
that
was
the
very
question
that
the
government
and
the
court
faced
in
the
brunswick-balke
case.
if
you
recall
there
the
--
the
facts
were
that
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
no,
sir,
i
--
i
think
that
they
may
have
found
--
thought
they
found
a
--
a
better
target
in
our
case.
but
we
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
yes,
sir.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
would
we
have
been
bound,
we
would
have
gone
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
we
would
have
had
to
go
to
trial.
he
had
the
alternative
of
either
entering
this
proposed
judgment
or
is
denying
it,
in
which
case
we
would
have
gone
to
trial.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
goes
back
to
whether
the
action
by
the
government,
if
the
court
contest
whether
that
action
is
arbitrary.
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
here.
the
court
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
your
honor,
i
feel
that
--
in
other
words,
if
we
--
if
i
get
your
question
correctly,
we
were
arbitrary
in
refusing
to
enter
the
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
--
consent
decree
with
the
government.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
yes.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
yes,
sir.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
no,
sir,
i
think
it
--
we
would've
insisted
on
our
right
to
go
trial,
and
that's
what
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
oh,
i
--
i
think
that's
when
the
government
is
arbitrary.
i
think,
the
court
can
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
(inaudible)
--
if
the
court
decides
that
the
government
is
arbitrary
in
insisting
on
this
provision
and
they
proffer
no
evidence
showing
a
triable
issue,
then
actually,
the
summary
judgment
procedure
that
we
have
covered
in
our
brief
says
that
--
and
the
cases
say
that
if
there
is
no
triable
issue,
then
the
court
can
enter
a
judgment.
now,
if
--
if
in
the
--
in
the
question
your
honor
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
sir?
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
we
were
not
willing
to
have
the
adjudication
of
guilt.
we
were
willing
to
have
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
--
considered
--
all
the
facts
conceded
for
the
purpose
of
relief.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
plea.
i
don't
practice
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
--
much
criminal
law
but
i
think
it's
something
like
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
unless
be
nolo
contendere.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
we
--
we
would
go
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
yes,
sir.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
i
think
that
if
you'd
want
to
capsule
it,
your
honor,
you
have
a
nolo
plea
contendere
in
the
criminal
law
and
we
are
saying,
when
the
government
is
arbitrary,
there
can
be
a
similar
plea
in
--
on
a
plea
and
adjudication
in
a
civil
case.
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
i
think
you'd
come
up
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
it
has
a
voice
but
the
--
the
recent
case
of
commonwealth
edison
versus
allis-chalmers
which
is
on
certiorari
to
this
court
from
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
--
they
make
the
very
point.
then
in
a
nolo
contendere
plea
in
a
--
in
the
antitrust
laws,
that
the
court,
in
balancing
the
two
objectives,
the
congressional
objectives
of
--
of
5
(a),
the
one
to
help
private
litigants
by
the
prima
facie
effect
and
the
other
to
encourage
litigants
to
come
in
and
plea.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
yes.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
that
is
correct.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
that's
correct.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
i
say
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
it
would
--
not
--
not
under
the
special
provisions
of
5
(a).
it
would
in
the
ordinary
criminal
law,
justice
clark.
but
under
the
special
provisions
of
5
(a),
it
would
not
be
tantamount
to
--
to
a
guilty
plea
as
far
as
the
later
use
of
it
is
evidence.
this
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
yes,
sir,
in
a
treble
damage
situation.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
your
honor,
here,
that's
one
of
the
things
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
--
but
here,
there
was
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
well,
that's
one
of
the
basic
objection.
but
here,
justice
black,
the
point
is
there
were
no
private
litigants
under
this
complaint
that
could've
been
helped
by
that.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
that's
correct.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
yes.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
in
--
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
now,
it
may
not
be
in
other
cases.
this
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
well,
the
--
the
point
is
that
--
that
was
raised
in
the
brunswick-balke
case
which
we
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
well,
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
relate
that
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
--
and
then
come
into
it.
in
the
brunswick-balke
case,
what
happened
was
the
government
and
the
private
party
substantially
agreed
on
all
the
terms
of
the
relief
and
then
the
government,
for
the
first
time
in
50
years
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
none,
your
honor.
if
they
have
--
if
the
right
is
there,
i
agree
with
you,
but
they
came
in
and
said,
"you've
got
to,
in
effect,
waive
your
privileges
of
the
prima
--
of
the
protection
of
5
(a)."
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
that's
one
of
the
things.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
that's
one
of
things,
your
honor.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
we
say
under
the
congressional
purposes
and
the
--
the
adjudicated
cases
of
twin
ports
oil
versus
pure
oil
and
the
commonwealth
edison
case
which
is
the
last
year
of
the
seventh
circuit,
that
that
would
thwart
the
intent
of
congress
in
encouraging
private
litigants
to
come
in
and
say,
"alright,
we'll
agree
to
our
consent
judgment."
and
in
effect,
the
--
mr.
bicks,
the
attorney
general,
when
he
proposed
this,
said
he
would
only
use
it
in
a
limited
number
of
cases
because
he
admitted
that
if
they
did
this
on
all
the
cases,
that
it
would
practically
wipeout
their
consent
decree
plan
and
--
that
they
used
in
settling
these
cases.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
your
--
your
--
the
point
is
justice
black,
there
are
two
purposes
of
congress.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
that's
one.
and
in
this
pose,
the
government
trying
to
get
an
adjudication
of
guilt
in
this
case
could
not
possibly
have
helped
any
third
party
because
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
well,
we
object
to
it,
your
honor,
because
number
one,
it
wasn't
proposed
down
below,
the
point
was
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
sir?
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
possibly,
it
can.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
but
we
are
waiving
--
we
are
waiving
our
right
under
5
(a),
if
it's
a
true
consent
situation
and
we
come
in,
we
are
waiving
whatever
privilege
there
is
of
the
--
that
congress
gave
us
in
5
(a)
to
come
in
and
do
that.
now
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
i
--
an
adjudication
--
entered
this
--
this
adjudication
we
claim
falls
within
the
provisions
of
5
(a),
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
yes
sir.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
that's
correct.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
no,
sir,
that's
--
that's
not
the
whole
issue.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
(voice
overlap)
the
other
issue
is
this,
we
say
that
they
are
using
this
as
a
lever.
we
go
back
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
well,
we
say
that
they
can't
do
--
use
it
arbitrarily.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
now,
in
other
words
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
--
they
don't
have
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
sir?
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
your
honor,
we
say
we
--
they're
using
this
as
a
lever
on
the
relief.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
relief
that
they
wanted
was
completely
outside
of
the
pleadings,
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
--
(voice
overlap)
pleading.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
and
that
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
well,
yes,
sir.
we
say
that
there
are
certain
limits
that
the
government
doesn't
have
an
unqualified
right
to
have
anything
without
any
test
of
the
court
of
whether
the
--
the
action
they
are
taken
is
arbitrary
to
ask
for
anything
that
they
want
in
a
consent
decree.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
i
--
i
think
the
issue
would
be
different.
it
would
be
a
brunswick-balke
situation
in
that
case.
but
i
think
it's
inherent
in
here
that
we
see
the
case,
your
honor.
they
come
in
with
this
broad,
unwarranted
relief
provision.
it's
way
beyond
the
pleadings
or
anything
else.
they
refuse
to
the
court
to
make
any
showing
why
they
needed
or
that
they
have
any
callable
evidence
to
support
it.
and
then,
in
order
to
force
us
into
that
type
of
relief,
which
is
completely
outside
the
scope
of
the
pleadings
and
outside
of
almost
the
scope
of
the
public
matter
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
well,
i
think
the
--
the
congressional
history
supports
this
and
if
you'll
examine
judge
nordbye's
opinion
in
twin
ports
oil
versus
pure
oil,
he
clearly
sets
forth
the
twin
congressional
purposes.
one
of
which
is
to
encourage
treble
damage
private
litigants
to
use
advantage
and
the
other
one
is
to
encourage
private
litigants
to
come
in
and
agree.
and
that
was
the
very
point
of
the
brunswick
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
the
private
litigants
to
come
in
and
in
effect,
consent
to
the
judgment
under
5
(a)
and
therefore
get
the
protection
of
5
(a),
judge
black.
and
this
was
the
entire
issue
in
brunswick-balke.
exactly
the
issue
raised
in
brunswick-balke,
whether
we
have
any
rights
under
5
(a)
and
we
think,
the
congressional
history
supports
that
we
have
rights.
now,
we
don't
claim
we
have
an
unqualified
right
because
it's
qualified
by
the
courts
entering
a
decree
which
under
its
equity
power,
it
feels
--
it
takes
care
of
the
situation.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
no,
the
first
two
did,
justice
stewart.
the
first
two
they
proposed
said,
in
effect,
"you've
got
to
admit
guilt
and
liability
in
any
suit
brought
by
a
state
agency."
then
in
the
last
one,
which
the
judgment
was
based
on,
they
only
gave
it
prima
facie.
they
said
that
--
that
you
got
to
agree
to
give,
even
though
it's
a
consent
judgment,
you
got
to
agree
to
give,
get
prima
facie
effect
in
a
suit
brought
by
the
other
local
governments.
and
that's
a
good
example
of
--
of
what
the
government
of
--
of
--
if
isn't
completely
has
unfettered
power
in
this
--
in
this
area,
what
the
government
will
do
because
they
--
that
judge
tehan
points
out
that
the
first
two
decrees
proposed
by
the
government
probably
would
be
unconstitutional,
a
conclusive
evidence
and
an
admission
of
guilt.
and
this,
if
the
legislative
history's
examine,
was
the
very
reason
why
they
changed
the
proposal
of
5
(a)
from
conclusive
evidence
to
prima
facie
evidence.
before
--
of
course,
they
were
concerned
with
the
constitutional
issues
and
the
doubtful
constitutionality
of
a
provision
that
would
make
it
conclusive
evidence
against
the
defendant.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
i
--
he's
a
member
of
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
--
the
bar
of
new
york.
i
have
no
other
knowledge
than
that.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
i
have
no
other
knowledge.
i
have
no
other
knowledge,
justice
stewart.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
we
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
well,
your
honor,
we
don't
think
this
answers
the
question.
we
think
that
this
is
going
really
to
trial
on
a
question
of
principle
rather
than
what
is
inherent
in
the
case.
and
we
think
that
it
would
also
defeat
one
of
the
purposes
of
5
(a)
and
the
intent
of
congress.
and
we
don't
feel
that
the
government
has
an
unqualified
right
to
insist
on
this
because
we
say
that
the
court,
through
its
pretrial
procedures,
should
protect
people
against
arbitrary
--
the
arbitrary
action
of
the
government.
now,
this
has
been
suggested
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
i
think
that
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
no,
sir,
i
think
the
government
would
be
arbitrary
if
they
ref
--
i
think
the
intent
of
congress
is
that
the
--
the
department
of
justice
will,
at
least,
enter
in
the
consent
decrees.
we
considered
this
before
the
argument
and
we
felt
that
--
that
under
5
(a)
and
the
antitrust
laws
that
at
least,
they've
got
to
--
to
--
they
would
completely
thwart
the
--
the
intent
of
congress
and
people
coming
in
and
getting
the
benefit
of
5
(a)
if
they
refused
absolutely
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
--
to
go
into
consent
decree
negotiation.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
yes,
sir.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
upon
an
admission
of
guilt,
i
think
that's
true.
i
think
that's
--
that's
how
(inaudible)
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
we
say
it
gives
us
some
rights
under
5
(a),
although
it's
not
an
unqualified
right,
judge
brennan.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
well,
your
honor,
they
--
they
are
using
the
--
this
adjudication
of
guilt
as
a
weapon
to
get
something
that
is
--
that's
an
arbitrary
relief
which
is
completely
outside
the
pleadings
and
unwarranted.
and
if
this
is
allowed
to
go
on,
they
could
completely
regulate
an
industry.
now
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
--
cases
of
controversy.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
we
--
we
have
stated,
your
honor,
that
the
--
the
district
judge
in
our
brief
has
a
discretion
and
the
question
here
is
whether
the
district
judge
has
abused
that
discretion.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
well,
we
think
that,
your
honor,
that
the
arbitrariness
of
the
government
comes
into
effect
because
we
realized
that
the
--
the
department
of
justice
has
to
have
an
area
in
which
to
enforce
the
antitrust
laws.
we
--
we
realized
that.
so
in
order
to
give
them
that
area,
you've
got
to
allocate
that
area
to
them,
but
there's
an
area
of
arbitrariness
beyond
which
we
say,
the
courts
through
it's
pretrial
procedures
can
determine
the
question
and
relieve
against
that
arbitrariness.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
that
the
court
could
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
no,
i
think
the
--
the
consent
negotiations
are
necessary
adjunct
and
a
--
and
a
prerequisite
to
it
because
i
think
that
the
--
it's
incumbent
on
the
attorney
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
--
on
the
department
of
justice.
if
they're
going
to
use
5
(a)
as
a
tool
to
use
--
to
realize
both
purposes
of
congress
in
it.
they
can't
just
take
one
purpose
and
not
the
other
purpose
and
completely
block
it
out.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
no,
it's
judge
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
that's
what
we
say
that
falls
within,
your
honor.
there's
some
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
no.
other
than
the
brunswick-balke
case,
it's
a
fresh
issue,
as
i
understand
before
any
appellate
court,
justice
white,
and
it's
never
been
adjudicated.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
sir?
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
no,
sir.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
aero
mayflower
which
the
government
didn't
appeal
which
was
entered
in
1956,
and
i
believe
the
middle
district
of
georgia,
the
same
procedure
was
followed
but
it's
not
unreported
case
except
in
cch
and
there's
not
much
record
to
adjudge
the
action
of
the
court.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
aero
mayflower
was
a
case
--
was
the
first
one
that
was
ever
used,
judge
black,
that
was
in
georgia.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
well,
that
was
in
1956
and
the
act
was
passed
back
about
1914,
i
think.
so
it
was
sometime
after.
what
the
--
the
government
has
never
asked
up
to
--
to
the
--
up
until
1960
to
in
effect
waived
the
provisions
of
a
5
(a).
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
they
had
never
presented
the
issue
prior
to
that
time
that
i
know
of,
judge
black.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
no,
sir,
not
other
than
the
aero
mayflower
case,
the
first
one
in
1956.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
do
i
think,
he
could?
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
no
sir,
i'm
not
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
yes,
sir,
i
think
he
could
in
this
sense.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
no.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
you
--
your
honor,
i
think,
if
he
--
you
consider
it
as
a
--
if
there
are
no
triable
--
if
there
are
no
triable
issues,
they
have
done
this
in
the
cases
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
sir?
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
yes,
sir.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
yes,
sir.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
that's
right.
we
would
have
to
make
that
--
we
--
we're
trying
to
get
it
so
there
were
no
justiciable
issue
to
go
to
trial.
and
the
court
used
the
pretrial
procedures
to
do
that.
and
once
he
determine
there
were
no
triable
issues
other
than
as
you
call
adjudication
of
guilt
to
triable
issues
but
the
facts
of
the
complaint
wasn't
it.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
that's
correct.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
he
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
that's
correct.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
that's
correct.
i
think
he
could
and
the
cases
that
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
where
that's
been
done,
where
the
court
through
pretrial
procedure
has
determined
that
there
are
no
triable
issues
for
trial.
and
--
and
the
law
is
clear
and
he
goes
in
and
enters
his
judgment.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
well,
i
--
i
think
it's
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
yes.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
it's
in
our
motion,
your
honor,
that's
at
page
52,
i
believe.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
wait
a
minute.
it's
at
the
--
at
the
page
56
at
the
bottom,
your
honor.
the
defendants
asked
the
court
to
enter
a
judgment
in
the
present
case
as
if
all
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
were
proven
as
true.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
except
for
the
--
for
the
purposes
of
determining
the
scope
of
the
relief,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
that
was
the
purpose
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
that's
--
well,
for
--
on
the
adjudication
to
guilt,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
were
testing
here,
your
honor,
whether
this
relief
was
arbitrary.
they
were
asking
for
the
--
the
injunctive
relief
and
that
was
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
--
the
purpose
of
our
motion.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
well,
judge
--
the
brunswick-balke
case,
i
see
my
time
is
up,
brunswick-balke
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
--
case
said
that
if
that
were
the
only
issue
in
the
case
left
that
then
the
court
had
the
power,
under
the
congressional
purpose
to
enter
the
judgment.
that
was
the
precise
point
that
judge
tehan
decided
in
the
brunswick-balke
case,
judge
warren.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
i
have
no
idea
but
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
i
don't
know
but
my
friend,
john
miller
from
savannah
was
in
the
aero
mayflair
--
flower
may
case
--
aero
mayflower
case
and
he
was
also
counsel
in
this
but
he
had
forgotten
all
about
it
until
we
dug
it
out
of
the
books.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
we
feel
that
we
would
not
be
accord
of
the
--
the
protection
of
5
(a),
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
oh,
yes,
we
--
we
had
to
--
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
we
can't
make
the
judge,
cannot
make
the
government's
record
full
of
them.
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
in
the
other
words,
he
was
trying
to
get
the
--
the
court
was
trying
to
get
a
record
to
see
if
there
were
any
disputed
facts.
and
the
government,
in
effect
said,
there
are
none.
they
said,
"we've
got
some
or
else,
we
--
we've
got
some
but
we
won't
show
them
to
you."
mr.
davisson
f.
dunlap
so
as
i
see
it
they
were
thwarting
the
--
the
court's
trying
to
see
if
what
they
were
doing
was
arbitrary
or
not.
thank
you.
