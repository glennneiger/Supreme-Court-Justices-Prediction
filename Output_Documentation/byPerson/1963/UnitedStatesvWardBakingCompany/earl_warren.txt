(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
have
been
bound
by
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
why
--
why
wouldn't
the
government
have
the
same
right
to
go
to
trial
that
you
do?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
the
court
--
if
a
court
wasn't
arbitrary
in
deciding
in
favor
of
the
government,
why
would
you
be
entitled
to
a
--
to
trial
by
the
same
reasoning?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
say,
if
in
this
proceeding,
as
it
in
the
posture
it
was
before
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
district
court
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
the
district
court
had
decided
against
you
and
had
--
had
offered
to
sign
the
--
had
signed
the
decree
of
the
government,
would
you
be
here
now
saying
they
didn't
--
he
didn't
have
a
right
to
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
now,
my
only
question
is
this,
if
you
have
a
right
to
go
to
trial,
if
--
if
the
court
decides
it
against
you,
why
doesn't
the
government
have
a
right
to
go
trial
if
he
decides
it
for
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
you
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
the
record
did
you
admit
the
facts
alleged
in
the
complaint
(inaudible)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
52?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
a
--
is
that
an
admission
that
all
of
them
were
true?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
mean
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
a
judgment
against
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
can't
say
there
--
there
are
no
issues
to
be
litigated
in
this
case
if
you
do
not
ad
--
admit
all
the
facts,
do
you
--
can
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
alright,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
orrick.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
did
you
say
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
expression
was
used
in
this
case,
the
--
the
sanctuary?
chief
justice
earl
warren
their
--
their
brief
16?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
see
it
there.
chief
