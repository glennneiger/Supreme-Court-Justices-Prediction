justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
orrick,
i
don't
quite
understand.
had
the
government
proved
this
case
on
the
merits,
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
alleged
violation.
would
its
proofs
have
included
not
only
rigging
prices
for
the
government
but
also
rigging
prices
to
the
public?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
between
the
--
within
this
pleading,
could
that
have
been
to
that
proof?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
this
--
is
this
then
--
was
treated
in
your
view,
this
is
like
a
non-vote
plea
in
a
criminal
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
perhaps
you
don't
have
it
in
florida,
but
i
thought
--
i
think
generally
--
no,
they
did
in
my
state
and
they
could
do
in
the
federal
system,
one
comes
in
and
he
doesn't
plea
guilty
to
the
offense
charged
but
he
pleads
non-vote,
which
is
only
to
say,
he
would
contest
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
charge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i'd
call
it
nolo
contendere
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
whatever
it
is.
is
that
what
you're
suggesting
is
what
in
fact,
you
did?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
ordinarily
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ordinarily,
a
nolo
contendere,
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
this,
i
thought
that
it
wasn't
for
the
judge
to
decide
whether
that
should
be
accepted.
doesn't
the
government
has
a
--
have
a
voice
whether
it
should
or
shouldn't
be
accepted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
you're
telling
me
is
that
if
these
were
a
criminal
antitrust
prosecution,
the
judge
could
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
notwithstanding
government
opposition
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
accept
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you're
suggesting
the
same
rule
by
analogy
at
least
those
do
apply
in
a
civil
charge,
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
does
government
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
i
correctly
summarize
your
position,
if
i
were
to
suggest,
it
goes
like
this,
that
if
the
government
wants
to
bring
a
lawsuit,
it
doesn't
have
to
but
if
it's
going
to
bring
a
lawsuit
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
congress
intended
by
5
(a),
that
a
judge
within
the
exercise
of
proper
equitable
jurisdiction
might
over
the
objection
of
the
government,
enter
this
kind
of
decree
on
these
admissions
of
jurors
without
an
admission
of
violation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
--
you
turn
this
all
and
what
congress
contemplated
should
govern
the
prosecution
of
such
an
action,
once
the
government
brought
if
you
came
in
and
made
these
admissions,
this
empowered
the
judge
to
exercise
equitable
discussion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
i
don't
--
if
that's
your
position
basically,
i
don't
quite
follow
why
you
put
such
emphasis
on
the
arbitrariness
of
the
government.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
if
you
are
right
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
you
are
right
--
if
you
are
right
that
the
congress
has
given
the
trial
judge
this
power,
then
the
test
ought
to
be
not
whether
the
government's
arbitrary
or
not,
but
whether
the
--
the
judge
has
exercised
the
power
properly
within
the
powers
of
the
--
that
the
congress
has
given
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
why
--
why
bother
about
whether
the
government's
arbitrary
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
only
thing
is,
mr.
dunlap,
this
proviso
on
5
(a)
isn't
limited
to
consent
judgments.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
shall
not
apply
to
consent
judgments
or
decrees
entered
before
any
testimony
has
been
taken
and
then
another
one.
and
i
gather
it's
not
the
consent
judgment
feature
that
you
suggest
you
come
within,
but
within
the
decree
entered
before
any
testimony
has
been
taken
in.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
the
key
to
it,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
would
have
to
do
something.
it's
not
only
that
you'd
walk
out
of
the
negotiation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
would
also
have
to
do
what
you
did
in
this
case
which
--
namely,
admit
the
facts
pleaded
without
admitting
that
they
add
up
to
a
violation
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
before
the
judge
would
have
any
power
to
force
anything
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i'd
--
i'd
be
surprised
if
anything
like
that
happened,
if
you
didn't
promptly
withdraw
your
admissions,
you
could
withdraw
them,
of
the
facts
pleaded
and
make
the
thing
go
to
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
would
suppose
that
there
has
to
be
at
least
that
basis
of
any
decree
under
5
(a),
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
--
am
i
correct,
had
followed
it,
that
congress
intended
this
all
along,
that
he
could
come
in
and
just
say,
"i
admit
the
facts
but
i
don't
admit
they
add
up
to
a
violation.
you
go
ahead
and
enter
a
decree
against
me",
which
then
would
give
him
in
--
those
circumstances
a
protection.
i
don't
agree
that
it's
not
a
sanctuary,
it's
certainly
some
kind
of
sanctuary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
against
--
it's
used
in
other
proceedings
against
him
under
the
antitrust
laws,
to
that
extent,
it's
a
sanctuary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
this
argument?
is
there
anything
in
the
complaint?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
in
the
legislative
history
would
support?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
either
in
the
reports
or
the
debates
or
otherwise?
