mr.
orrick
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
a
civil
antitrust
case,
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
florida.
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
is
conferred
by
section
2
of
the
expediting
act.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
a
simple
one.
after
consent
decree
negotiations
between
the
government
and
appellees
had
reached
an
impasse,
appellees
requested
the
district
court
to
enter
an
injunction
which
was
narrower
than
that
sought
by
the
government.
the
difference
between
these
two
decrees
turned
on
factual
issues
without
a
trial
of
any
kind
on
those
issues
or
indeed,
on
any
of
the
issues
framed
by
the
pleadings
and
without
the
consent
of
the
government,
the
district
court
entered
the
injunction
proposed
by
the
appellees.
the
question
simply
stated
is
whether
the
district
court
erred
and
so
doing.
the
underlying
facts
are
very
briefly
these,
on
march
6,
1961,
two
indictments
were
filed
in
the
court
below
charging
certain
bakery
companies
with
conduct
which
violated
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
in
one
indictment,
all
five
appellees
here
were
charged
with
combining
and
conspiring
to
allocate
among
themselves
the
business
of
supplying
bread
and
rolls
to
federal
naval
installations
in
jackson,
florida
and
submitting
non-competitive
and
rigged
bids
and
price
quotations.
in
the
second
indictment,
four
of
the
five
appellees
here
plus
two
other
companies
were
charged
with
combining
and
conspiring
to
fix
and
maintain
the
prices
in
which
they
sold
bakery
products
to
nongovernment
wholesale
accounts
which
are
defined
as
grocery
stores,
supermarkets,
hotels,
restaurants
and
similar
large
purchasers.
all
of
the
defendants
in
both
criminal
cases
were
convicted
on
their
pleas
of
nolo
contendere
and
fines
were
imposed.
now,
the
case
at
bar,
a
civil
action,
was
brought
against
all
five
of
the
defendants
who
had
been
convicted
of
fixing
prices
in
connection
with
the
sales
to
the
government.
four
of
whom,
as
i've
previously
stated,
were
also
convicted
of
fixing
prices
on
the
nongovernment
sales.
the
complaint
asked
for
both
damages
and
injunctive
relief
pertaining
to
the
violations
on
sales
to
the
government
and
in
addition,
a
request
for
whatever
more
general
injunctive
relief
might
be
deemed
appropriate
after
a
trial.
answers
containing
general
denials
were
filed
in
due
course
and
thereafter,
consent
decree
negotiations
were
initiated
by
appellees
with
government
counsel.
these
negotiations
followed
the
normal
course.
the
parties
first
negotiated
a
settlement
of
a
count
for
damages
and
they
have
reached
an
agreement
pursuant
to
which
the
parties
paid
--
agreed
to
pay
the
government
$44,000.
at
that
time,
the
--
the
appellees
offered
to
take
an
injunction
limited
to
the
specific
prayers
set
forth
in
the
complaint.
the
government,
this
was
not
satisfactory
to
the
government,
and
the
government
proposed
a
broader
injunction
enjoining
the
defendants
from
price
fixing
with
regard
to
sales
to
third
parties
and
forbidding
certain
attempts
to
set
the
price
on
resale
of
the
appellees'
bakery
products.
counsel
for
the
appellees
refused
to
accept
the
government's
proposal
and
he
then
submitted
a
--
another
proposal
which
was
broader
in
scope
than
his
first
one
and
went
beyond
the
scope
of
the
prayers
for
relief
in
the
complaint.
further
attempts
to
negotiate,
and
they
were
a
good
many,
which
i
won't
detail,
were
fruitless
and
the
negotiations
reached
an
impasse.
and
just
briefly,
the
government
wished
two
provisions
to
which
the
appellees
would
not
agree.
first,
that
they
be
enjoined
from
price
fixing
with
regard
to
sales
to
third
parties
and
second,
that
they
be
enjoined
from
setting
the
price
on
resale
of
their
bakery
products.
appellees
then
filed
a
motion
in
the
court
below
for
entry
of
their
first
judgment.
the
court
issued
an
order
to
show
cause
why
the
judgment
shouldn't
be
entered.
appellees
then
amended
the
motion
to
have
the
court
enter
their
broader
proposal
and
a
hearing
was
held
on
this
motion.
at
the
hearing,
the
court
was
advised
by
counsel
for
both
sides
of
the
nature
of
the
impasse.
and
he
was
advised
by
counsel
for
the
government
that
at
the
trial
and
at
the
hearing
on
relief,
the
government
would
bring
in
evidence
to
support
its
broader
decree.
now,
the
understanding
of
the
court
and
counsel
for
the
appellees
seemed
to
be
that
if
the
court
entered
appellees'
proposed
decree,
the
government
did
not
have
a
right
to
go
to
trial.
but
if
the
court
decided
to
enter
the
government's
proposed
decree,
then
the
appellees
would
have
the
right
to
go
to
trial.
i'd
--
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
this
unusual
situations,
which
is
in
the
government's
brief
reproduced
in
a
footnote
at
page
33,
and
i
just
briefly
summarize
it.
the
court
says,
"let
me
say
this
now,
that
i'm
going
to
enter
your
decree
or
the
government's
decree."
one
say,
"i'm
going
to
enter
a
decree
here.
i'm
not
just
going
to
enter
an
order
after
this
30-day
expires
saying
we'd
better
go
on
to
a
trial.
is
that
understood?"
counsel
for
both
side
said,
"no,
sir."
and
then
the
counsel
for
the
appellees
went
on
and
he
said,
"we
did
not
agree
that
we
were
foreclosed
from
a
right
to
go
to
trial
if
you
decided
to
enter
the
government's
decree."
now,
i
--
i
agree
that
the
appellees
were
correct
in
asking
for
their
day
in
court
and
that's
just
what
we're
asking
here.
the
court
then,
on
december
10
of
1962,
entered
as
a
final
judgment
in
this
case.
the
defendant
second
proposed
judgment
was
modified
in
certain
respects
at
the
hearing.
and
i
--
the
judgment
on
its
face
recites
that
it
was
entered
and
i
quote,
"without
trial
or
adjudication
of
any
of
the
issues
of
factory
law
and
before
the
taking
of
any
testimony",
and
upon
the
appellees'
motion.
and
so
the
government,
in
a
suit
brought
by
the
attorney
general,
to
vindicate
public
rights,
winds
up
with
a
decree
which
it
doesn't
like
even
though
it
is
neither
consented
to
the
entry
of
that
decree
nor
been
provided
with
a
litigants'
basic
right
to
make
the
record.
and
now,
as
the
court
please
--
mr.
orrick
--
is
--
mr.
orrick
we
--
we
would
--
we
would
like
in
--
in
admission
of
adjudication,
mr.
justice,
and
on
the
issue
of
relief,
i
think
that
district
court,
where
there's
any
factual
issue,
cannot
fashion
a
proper
decree
without
taking
evidence.
mr.
orrick
well,
there's
a
factual
issue
on
the
scope
of
the
relief,
mr.
justice,
yes,
sir,
because
the
scope
of
the
relief
very
often
and
particularly
in
antitrust
litigation,
it
must
go
beyond
the
--
the
facts
that
are
pleaded
in
the
complaint.
this
court
recognized
this
in
the
u.s.
gypsum
case.
but
the
government
here,
i
want
to
make
clear,
doesn't
ask
the
court
to
order
entry
of
its
proposed
judgment.
and
indeed,
the
government's
complaint
is
that
it
has
no
record
on
which
to
base
such
a
request.
that's
the
striking
feature
of
this
case.
instead,
the
government
asked
that
the
district
court's
judgment
be
vacated
and
the
case
be
remanded
for
trial.
now
the
issue
here
is
of
great
practical
importance
in
the
administration
of
the
antitrust
law.
mr.
orrick
yes
sir.
mr.
orrick
the
--
the
adjudication?
i
--
i
think
mr.
justice,
the
government
is
entitled
to
an
adjudication.
the
--
we
make
that
point
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief
where
we
discussed
the
brunswick
case
and
i
think
we're
entitled
to
an
adjudication.
it
often
makes
a
--
a
difference
in
the
scope
or
the
--
mr.
orrick
no
--
i
think,
if
you
please,
sir,
we
think
it
is
the
scope
of
the
relief.
although
it's
perfectly
clear
here,
we
didn't
even
get
an
adjudication.
mr.
orrick
but
the
--
the
issue
is
very,
very
important
in
antitrust
administration
because
more
than
80%
of
our
cases
in
fiscal
year
1963,
civil
cases
were
settled
by
this
--
by
consent
decrees.
and
the
disposition
of
cases
by
these
decrees
has
--
and
the
court
is
well
aware,
it
saves
large
expenditures
of
time,
energy
and
money
including
the
time
and
energy
of
the
courts.
and
the
possible
savings
are
often
a
factor
in
determining
what
relief
by
way
of
consent
decree
the
government
may
accept.
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
use
by
the
courts
of
consent
decree
negotiations
as
a
basis
for
entering
a
decree
without
a
trial
and
without
the
consent
of
the
government
would
quickly
tend
to
inhibit
our
negotiations
in
future
cases.
our
position
briefly
summarized
is
this.
first,
that
when
relief
turns
upon
disputed
questions
of
fact,
those
facts
must
be
resolved
in
a
trial
record
made.
and
secondly
--
mr.
orrick
yes,
sir,
the
sales
of
the
--
to
the
public
here
in
question.
we
offered
at
the
hearing.
we
stated
to
the
judge
there
several
times
in
the
course
of
our
hearing
that
we
were
prepared
to
present
to
the
court
facts
on
the
scope
of
relief
which
would
show
that
relief
enjoining
these
defendants
from
fixing
sales
to
the
--
fixing
prices
on
sales
to
the
public
was
proper.
and
both
page
90
in
the
record
and
at
94,
we've
--
our
counsel
pointed
that
out
to
the
court.
mr.
orrick
we
--
we
said
that
we
had,
mr.
justice,
and
i
think
the
--
the
record
--
mr.
orrick
--
on
page
90
is
the
best
that
our
counsel
said.
third,
if
the
case
were
to
be
tried,
the
government
would
be
afforded
the
opportunity,
both
at
the
trial
and
at
the
hearing
on
relief,
to
offer
evidence
in
support
of
its
claim
for
injunctive
relief
broader
than
that
offered
by
defendants
proposed
judgment.
and
also
over
again
on
page
--
i
said
94
--
mr.
orrick
--
both
94
and
95.
mr.
orrick
no,
sir.
the
record
is
barren
of
any
request
at
all
by
the
court
to
the
government
asking
it
to
produce
facts
and
--
mr.
orrick
the
--
the
government
--
what
the
government
did
as
i'd
--
has
set
out
here,
if
you
please,
sir,
on
page
90
and
then
94
and
95.
but
i
want
to
point
out,
mr.
justice,
that
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case
because
judge
bryan
simpson,
in
his
order
said
--
and
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
his
order
on
page
128
of
the
transcript,
that
his
judgment
was
based
upon
this
court's
knowledge
of
the
facts
involved
in
11677-crim-j.
and
this
record,
this
proposed
judgment
provides
all
the
relief
to
which
the
defendants
are
entitled
to.
and
bear
in
mind
if
you
would,
sir,
that
this
is
the
very
same
judge
for
whom
both
indictments
were
returned
and
before
whom
all
defendants
were
convicted
on
their
pleas
of
nolo
contendere
in
the
criminal
cases.
mr.
orrick
so
--
mr.
orrick
yes,
sir,
he
did.
and
--
and
with
--
based
on
his
personal
knowledge
and
--
mr.
orrick
--
of
course,
this
is
without
any
judicial
sanction
that
i
know
of
where
the
--
can
dispose
of
a
litigated
case
without
making
findings
of
fact
under
rule
52
(a).
mr.
orrick
i
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
justice,
that
that
is
the
only
real
--
mr.
orrick
--
ground
urged
by
--
by
the
appellees.
and
i
could
--
i'll
briefly
come
to
that
in
a
moment
if
i
may
but
i
--
i
just
want
to
--
mr.
orrick
in
summarizing
our
position,
then
our
position
is,
first,
that
when
the
relief
turns
upon
the
disputed
questions
of
fact,
these
questions
must
be
resolved
in
the
record
made.
and
second,
that
the
district
court's
procedure
impinges
upon
the
discretion
which
is
vested
in
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
and
then
the
third,
that
there's
nothing
in
section
5
(a)
that
authorizes
the
procedures
followed
by
the
district
court.
when
--
mr.
orrick
well
that
--
the
question
of
the
--
the
scope
of
the
relief,
mr.
justice,
the
--
mr.
orrick
what
--
the
government
wanted
to
--
items
of
relief
that
the
appellees
did
not
want
to
agree
to.
mr.
orrick
yes.
mr.
orrick
yes
--
yes
sir.
mr.
orrick
that's
correct
in
the
--
in
the
complaint.
mr.
orrick
the
--
there
was
no
adjudication
here
of
guilt
in
this
--
in
the
liability
in
the
civil
suit.
mr.
orrick
that's
correct,
yes,
sir.
and
they
objected
--
mr.
orrick
--
to
the
(inaudible)
--
they
then
had
the
choice
of
going
to
a
trial.
they
did
not
have
a
double
privilege
of
rejecting
the
consent
judgment
proffered
by
the
government
and
at
the
same
time,
avoid
an
--
an
adjudication
on
the
merits
of
the
government's
compliant.
mr.
orrick
if
--
if
--
our
position
would
be
to
--
in
the
nature
of
the
antitrust
enforcement
but
we
would
at
least
then
have
an
adjudication
and
that
would
be
the
proper
way
to
decide
that.
but
in
fashioning
a
consent
decree,
we
thought
we
were
of
the
view
and
are
of
the
view
that
the
broader
relief
is
proper
particularly
since
four
or
the
five
appellees
here
had
been
actually
convicted
of
the
sales
to
the
price
fixing
sale
to
the
government.
mr.
orrick
mr.
justice,
there
very
definitely
is
and
is
here
a
disputed
question
of
--
of
facts
with
respect
to
the
type
of
relief
that
should
be
entered.
mr.
orrick
well,
the
--
the
government
claims
and
intended
to
prove,
and
i
think
indeed,
did
prove
in
the
criminal
case
that
four
out
of
the
five
defendants
here
were
guilty
of
the
charge
of
fixing
prices
to
the
public.
now,
based
on
that,
the
government
thought
that
it
was
entitled
in
a
consent
decree
--
mr.
orrick
--
that
it
was
proper
for
any
due
--
mr.
orrick
pardon
me?
mr.
orrick
well
the
--
the
district
judge
here
doesn't
advert
to
them
in
the
--
mr.
orrick
--
order.
he
doesn't
give
the
court
an
opportunity
to
hear
what
these
facts
are
as
they
relate
to
the
civil
complaint.
and
he
enters
this
judgment
out
of
hand
without
the
consent
of
the
government
and
without
a
trial.
mr.
orrick
did
he
--
mr.
orrick
that
they
--
and
the
appellees
would
--
would
not
--
we
don't
know
what
they'd
had
done
have
the
case
been
tried,
mr.
justice.
they
wouldn't
take
the
broader
injunctive
relief.
mr.
orrick
and
i
didn't
--
that's
--
mr.
orrick
--
the
dispute
as
i
know
it.
mr.
orrick
yes,
sir,
general
denial.
mr.
orrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
orrick
not
--
not
to
--
on
the
--
and
the
answers,
what's
in
the
record,
i
don't
have
any
recollection
of
--
that
they've
been
--
mr.
orrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
orrick
it
could
very
well
have,
mr.
justice
and
--
mr.
orrick
we
could
have
amended
the
pleading
to
conform
the
proof.
and
we
would
surely
on
a
hearing
on
relief
where
as
i
pointed
out
previously,
this
court
has
recognized
that
you
very
often
have
to
have
--
the
scope
of
relief
has
to
be
broader
than
the
specific
violations.
there
isn't
any
question,
we
ought
to
have
shown
it,
and
this
judge
knew
it.
that's
the
extraordinary
thing.
but
if
this
--
the
procedure
impinges
on
the
discretion
that
the
attorney
general
has
to
determine
what
the
acceptable
scope
of
relief
is.
and
very
often,
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
enter
a
consent
decree,
an
admission
or
an
adjudication
is
an
effective
sanction
which
operates
as
a
part
of
the
remedy
and
bears
upon
the
sufficiency
of
other
relief.
mr.
orrick
no,
sir.
and
it's
not
our
judgment,
if
you
please,
sir.
mr.
orrick
no,
sir.
mr.
orrick
but
it
--
may
i
--
i
come
--
i'd
--
i
said
i'd
--
with
reference
to
mr.
stewart's
question,
i'd
come
to
section
--
mr.
orrick
--
5
(a)
and
at
this
point,
let
me
take
that
up.
section
5
(a)
was
added
to
it,
was
in
the
clayton
act
in
1914.
and
it
is
designed
to
assist
in
the
administration
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
the
section
of
the
statute
is
set
out
at
page
2
of
our
brief
and
briefly
summarized.
section
(a)
says
that
a
final
judgment
or
decree
rendered
in
any
civil
or
criminal
proceedings
brought
by
the
united
states
under
the
antitrust
laws
to
the
effect
that
a
defendant
had
violated
said
laws,
shall
be
prima
facie
evidence
against
such
defendant
in
any
action
or
proceeding
brought
by
any
other
party.
that's
clear
enough.
now
then
the
proviso,
which
appellees,
i
think
erroneously
construe,
provides
that
this
section
shall
not
apply
to
consent
judgments
or
decrees
entered
before
any
testimony
has
been
taken.
now,
appellees
cite
this
section
as
--
they
call
it
on
page
16
of
their
brief,
a
sanctuary
for
antitrust
violators,
if
you
please.
and
this,
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
history,
where
this
section
was
added
to
--
by
an
aroused
--
at
--
at
the
instance
of
an
aroused
president
wilson
and
an
aroused
congress
to
get
more
effective
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws.
there's
nothing,
i
submit,
in
the
legislative
history
to
support
any
such
assertion.
but
as
i
pointed
out,
it
doesn't
give
them
the
double
privilege,
surely,
of
rejecting
the
pretrial
consent
judgment
which
is
proffered
by
the
government
and
then
at
the
same
time
avoid
an
adjudication
on
the
merits.
now,
i
will
tell
you
conscientiously
that
we
have
tried
to
ascertain
the
basic
--
the
reasoning
behind
this.
and
i'd
simply
can
do
and
perhaps
mr.
dunlap
is
better
qualify
than
i
do,
do
that.
mr.
orrick
mr.
chief
justice,
very
briefly
a
word,
thinking
about
what
the
first
defendant
to
--
who
thought
of
this,
the
--
it
was
tried
in
the
hartford-empire
case
back
in
1944
before
judge
kloeb.
and
while
we
are
citing
these
district
judges,
i'd
like
to
add
my
voice,
if
i
may,
to
cite
judge
wyzanski,
who
--
and
we
argued
his
case
there
on
page
88
of
our
record
in
united
states
against
lake
asphalt
where
he
said,
"it
seems
to
be
preposterous
for
me
to
purport
to
act
on
the
consent
of
one
side
over
the
objection
of
the
other
side
without
making
findings.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
an
absolute
violation
of
every
rule
that
i
ever
heard
of."
and
let
me
again
state,
if
i
may,
that
section
5
(a)
was
put
in
the
clayton
act
to
enforce
the
antitrust
laws.
there
was
no
thought
or
whatsoever
given
at
that
time
in
1914
that
this
was
a
sanctuary
for
--
behind
which
antirust
violators
could
find
--
could
hide
behind.
mr.
orrick
and
--
mr.
orrick
it's
on
page
16
of
the
appellees'
brief.
mr.
orrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
orrick
it's
at
the
top
--
the
very
top
of
the
page.
the
first
sentence
is
there.
mr.
orrick
and
antitrust
law
enforcement
would
come
to
a
grinding
litigated
halt
because
it's
the
very
importance
to
the
defendants
of
being
able
to
enter
into
a
consent
decree
and
avoid
these
treble
damage
suits
that
enables
the
government
to
carryout
a
decree
--
sensible
program
of
law
enforcement.
mr.
orrick
and
it
--
mr.
orrick
that's
--
what
they're
contending,
they
claim
they
have
a
double
privilege
here
than
--
mr.
orrick
that's
certainly
it
and
--
but
--
mr.
orrick
that's
right.
and
they
--
they
say
that
a
trial
judge
has
two
jobs.
his
first
job
is
to
determine
whether
the
parties'
desire
to
agree
as
honest
as
they
call
it.
he
sets
that
out
on
page
22
of
his
brief.
and
whether
the
attorney
general's
view
as
to
the
relief
he
seeks
is
warranted.
so
that's
the
first
judgment
that
the
judge
must
make
--
mr.
orrick
--
and
--
mr.
orrick
that's
the
--
and
then
on
the
second
judgment
by
the
--
he
has
a
post
trial
judgment,
that
the
evidence
has
shown
the
government's
entitled
to
the
remedy
it
seeks.
and
if
the
court
please,
if
the
attorney
general
--
mr.
orrick
yes,
sir.
mr.
orrick
where
--
that
they
--
mr.
orrick
well,
it
--
mr.
orrick
there
is
--
there's
nothing,
mr.
justice,
if
you
please
because
the
--
this
--
mr.
orrick
nothing
in
the
legislative
history.
the
--
this
legislation
was
passed
in
the
context
of
an
aroused
president
and
--
and
an
aroused
congress
that
the
antitrust
laws
weren't
being
enforced.
the
--
president
wilson's
message
is
clear
as
to
what
he'd
asked
for
in
the
--
the
purpose
of
it.
the
legislative
history
is
clear.
the
proviso
was
added
in
the
--
in
the
conference.
and
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence
in
any
place
that
this
was
the
sanctuary.
mr.
orrick
no,
sir.
