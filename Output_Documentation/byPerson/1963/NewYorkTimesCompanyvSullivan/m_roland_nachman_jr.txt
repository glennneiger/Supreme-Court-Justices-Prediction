mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
what
at
the
outset
to
what
i
consider
to
be
a
short
difference
between
mr.
wechsler's
analysis
of
the
facts
and
facts
as
i
see
them.
and
i
would
like
to
do
that
in
the
context
that
this
case
is
here
obviously
after
a
jury
verdict,
after
the
case
has
been
before
a
trial
court
on
a
motion
for
new
trial,
after
it's
been
before
the
high
state
appellate
court.
and
we
do
not
rely
on
there
being
something
in
the
record
to
support
it.
we
say
there
was
ample
and
indeed
overwhelming
evidence
to
support
the
jury
verdict
but
we
do
remind
the
court
at
the
outset
in
view
of
the
trend
of
the
argument
as
it
has
gone
up
to
now.
we're
not
here
like
in
norris
on
a
question
of
whether
a
judge
in
a
pretrial
proceeding
correctly
decided
the
question
of
whether
there
was
discrimination
against
negroes
in
the
selection
of
a
grand
jury
panel.
and
we're
not
here
as
in
bridges
on
the
question
of
whether
a
judge
was
correct
when
he
decided
a
contempt
proceeding.
we're
here
after
a
jury
trial
with
all
that
that
means
in
terms
of
the
seventh
amendment.
now,
on
the
issue
of
falsity,
which
is
where
mr.
wechsler
began,
i
would
like
to
take
this
step-by-step
as
this
lawsuit
progressed.
a
demand
for
retraction
was
filed
as
it
had
to
be
filed
under
alabama
law
before
the
lawsuit
began.
an
answer
was
received
and
this
is
in
the
record.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
it's
alright
sir.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
c.
b.
&
q.
which
we've
--
again,
chicago
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief
your
honor
and
other
--
many
other
cases
say
that
the
protections
of
the
seventh
amendment
which
surround
the
reexamination
of
jury
verdicts
apply
equally
to
state
jury
verdicts
as
they
do
to
federal
jury
verdicts.
that
was
the
point
that
i
had
in
mind
sir,
yes,
sir.
the
answer
to
the
demand
for
retraction
admitted
at
the
outset
that
one
of
the
serious
charges
contained
in
the
ad
was
false,
namely
that
the
dining
halls
had
been
padlocked
but
there
was
a
refusal
to
retract.
this
refusal
to
retract
came,
the
evidence
shows
after
an
investigation
made
by
a
string
correspondent
in
montgomery
in
which
he
outlined
the
falsity
of
these
charges.
there
was
still
a
refusal
to
retract.
then
the
lawsuit
was
filed
and
after
certain
procedural
matters
were
out
of
the
way,
motions
to
quash
and
demurrers,
the
times
filed
six
separate
pleas
to
the
complaint.
not
one
of
those
pleas,
not
one
of
the
six
had
the
slightest
suggestion
in
it
that
this
ad
was
true
in
any
particular.
mr.
wechsler
made
the
argument
that
it
might
be
difficult
for
the
times
to
plead
truth
because
it
might
have
to
spell
out
its
theory
that
there
was
some
question
in
its
mind
as
to
whether
the
ad
applied
to
the
plaintiff.
but
we
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
scope
and
detail
of
one
of
the
pleas,
pleas
six
which
appears
on
page
102
of
the
record.
a
plea
which
extends
for
almost
three
and
a
half
pages
of
the
printed
record
of
this
case,
a
plea
which
sets
out
the
entire
law
of
new
york
on
libel,
cite
statutes
as
well
as
judicial
decisions
on
the
theory
that
the
law
of
new
york
as
a
matter
of
choice
of
law
should
be
applied
to
this
case.
there
was
no
difficulty
in
pleading
truth
in
this
case,
we
submit.
if
the
times
had
felt
this
ad
was
true
or
any
part
of
it
was
true,
it
could've
set
that
out
in
its
plea
but
it
did
not
do
so.
it
did
not
suggest
in
any
one
of
its
pleas
that
any
part
of
this
publication
was
true.
then
we
move
to
the
trial.
we
have
excerpted
in
the
appendix
of
our
brief
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
on
page
48.
we
have
excerpted
10
examples
of
comments
made
by
counsel
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
suggestions
to
witnesses
and
comments
to
the
court
in
the
course
of
objections
to
evidence
and
so
on,
suggesting
in
the
presence
of
the
jury,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
this
ad
was
false.
an
example,
if
i
may
be
indulged
in
reading.
"isn't
in
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
in
and
around
montgomery
that
we
have
been
reading
from
this
ad
is
not
true."
this
was
to
a
witness.
this
is
page
625
of
the
record.
answer:
yes
sir,
they
know
it's
not
true.
another
example,
"you
didn't
believe
it
to
be
true
when
you
read
it,
did
you
mr.
kaminsky?"
answer:
no.
i
didn't
think
mr.
--
commissioner
sullivan
would
do
that.
that's
at
page
638
of
the
record.
another
example,
to
another
witness,
"you
didn't
believe
that
it
was
true,
did
you?"
answer:
i
knew
it
wasn't
true.
and
another
question
to
the
same
witness,
"you
never
thought
it
was
true
or
had
any
idea
it
was
true?"
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i'm
talking
about
--
i'm
addressing
myself
to
mr.
wechsler's
argument
that
this
ad
is
--
is
inaccurate
in
certain
particulars,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no,
sir.
the
type
of
question
i
have
referenced
to
is
whether
the
ad
--
the
words
in
the
ad.
1i'm
addressing
myself
to
mr.
wechsler's
contention
as
i
understood
it
sir,
that
this
ad
was
only
incorrect
in
some
particulars.
i'm
--
i'm
saying
that
what
went
to
the
jury
was
an
admission
really
by
counsel
for
the
new
york
times
from
the
very
outset
of
this
case,
from
the
pleadings,
from
what
happened
during
the
trial
and
from
the
evidence
which
i
will
get
to
in
a
moment,
sir.
that
this
was
false
not
just
in
some
particulars
but
completely
false
and
that
there
was
no
attempt
made
at
the
trial
by
the
times
to
say
that
any
of
these
was
true.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i
am
not
saying
that
there
was
no
attempt
made
by
the
times
to
justify.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
mr.
wechsler
pointed
out,
mr.
bancroft,
the
secretary
of
the
corporation,
who
was
there
at
the
counsel
table
throughout
the
trial
on
the
cross-examination,
stated
that
he
thought
it
was
substantially
correct
with
the
exception
of
the
padlocking
statement.
what
i'm
saying
sir
is
that
there
was
evidence
from
the
times
itself
from
his
pleadings
from
--
from
statements
of
his
counsel,
from
evidence
in
the
case
in
addition
to
this
which
could
justify
a
jury
verdict
that
the
entire
ad
was
false.
and
as
i
began
by
saying,
this
case
comes
here
obviously,
after
a
jury
verdict
and
i'm
saying
that
there's
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
entire
ad
was
false.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
excuse
me
sir.
yes
sir,
the
two
com
--
paragraphs,
we
complained
of,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
--
the
second
and
--
of
the
paragraph
and
the
six
i
believe.
i
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i
didn't
mean
to
--
to
address
myself.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
he
was
the
trial
counsel,
yes,
but
there
were
others.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
he
brought
out
questions
from
these
witnesses.
this
isn't
true
and
the
witness
said
no.
it
isn't,
and
this
went
to
the
jury.
and
--
and
we
say
that's
evidence
to
support
a
finding
of
falsity
on
the
part
of
the
jury,
not
just
falsity
in
part
but
falsity
completely.
we're
not
saying
that
the
times,
at
some
point
did
not
seek
to
justify
as
indeed
with
mr.
bancroft's
statement.
what
we
say
is,
here's
evidence
that
went
to
a
jury
on
complete
falsity,
not
just
partial
falsity.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
we
--
we
say,
no
sir,
unless
there
is
no
basis
whatever.
no,
it's
devoid
of
reason,
the
thompson
test.
but
we
say
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
correct,
sir.
or
in
other
words,
we
say
that
the
seventh
amendment
protects
this
verdict
unless
this
court
finds
that
there's
no
reasonable
basis,
whatever
for
it.
there's
no
evidence
at
all
to
support
it
that
the
thompson
against
louisville
situation
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
the
seventh
amendment.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
state
trial,
yes,
sir
that
that
--
the
jury
verdict
reexamined
otherwise
and
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
common
law
which
is
--
we
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
protects
state
verdicts
as
well
as
--
as
federal
verdicts.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
well,
yes,
sir.
the
jury
was
not
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
you
mean
the
characterization
of
the
ad
as
libelous
your
honor?
that
--
that
was
a
question
that
the
court
decided
but
there
we
say
that
is
a
question
of
state
law
and
--
and
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
your
honor,
i
would
--
i
would
answer
that
in
two
ways.
up
to
now,
as
--
as
we
--
we
read
the
cases,
"the
court
has
left
the
characterization
of
publications
as
libelous
or
not
libelous
to
the
states."
now,
if
we
would
certainly
concede
that
if
a
statement
was
made
that
somebody
had
blonde
hair
and
a
state
court
held
that
this
statement
was
libelous
per
se,
well
of
course
this
--
this
court
should
--
could
review
it.
but
adverting
to
--
to
some
of
mr.
justice
black's
observations
in
his
questions,
we
say
that
when
this
kind
of
conduct
is
charged,
this
is
within
the
normal
usual
rubric
and
framework
of
--
of
libel.
it
charges
them
with
criminal
offenses
of
the
charges
which
certainly
hold
them
up
to
contempt
and
--
and
ridicule
and
disapproval
and
--
and
we
think,
we
are
well
within
the
--
the
classic
definition
of
libel.
we
don't
say
sir
and
no
circumstances
could
--
could
this
court
review
a
state
characterization.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
a
prima
facie
presumption.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
the
--
this
is
not
an
absolute
presumption.
in
other
words,
if
a
publication
is
libel
per
se,
that's
enough
to
get
the
plaintiff
to
the
jury.
this
does
not
mean
that
the
defendant
cannot
introduce
evidence
to
show
that
it's
true.
but
in
this
case,
the
defendant
didn't
even
plead
truth.
i
--
i
submit
that
this
is
what
the
--
the
court
had
in
mind
in
as
a
prima
facie
presumption
under
alabama
law.
and
--
and
certainly
not
an
absolute
presumption
which
cannot
be
rebutted
by
the
defendant.
so
we
say
that
we
come
then
to
the
question
of
the
retraction.
now,
as
mr.
wechsler
said,
the
times
retracted
the
same
ad
on
the
basis
of
the
same
demand
where
the
governor
of
alabama
used
to
do
so
for
this
plaintiff.
and
this,
may
we
remind
the
court,
was
approximately
six
months
before
the
trial
and
it
was,
the
evidence
shows
after
a
second
investigation
had
been
made,
this
time
by
mr.
sitton
who
was
a
regular
full-time
regional
correspondent
of
the
times
who
was
stationed
in
atlanta.
he
advised
the
times
that
the
first
paragraph
to
use
his
words,
was
virtually
without
foundation.
as
to
the
second
paragraph,
he
noted
the
four
arrests
for
dr.
king
for
--
for
speeding
and
loitering
and
--
and
the
bombing
and
the
fact
that
he
was
under
indictment
for
perjury
charged
on
which
he
was
later
acquitted.
the
times
in
its
retraction
stated
that
there
were
errors
and
misstatements
in
the
ad
and
accordingly,
it
was
retracted.
it
didn't
specify
that
any
part
of
it
was
true.
it
retracted
the
whole
ad
and
it
didn't
simply
apologize.
as
i
say,
it
stated
that
there
were
errors
and
misstatements
in
the
ad.
then
six
months
later
as
--
almost,
when
this
case
came
to
trial,
the
times
with
no
plea
of
truth,
with
these
investigations
in
the
record,
with
live
oral
testimony
from
witnesses
including
the
respondent
that
the
matters
were
false,
with
the
judicial
admission,
we
submit
of
a
failure
to
plea
truth
which
is
an
absolute
defense
regardless
of
motive
under
alabama
law.
this
matter
went
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
found
that
it
was
false.
now,
we
submit
that
there
is
ample
support
in
this
record.
we
submit
that
mr.
wechsler
should
fail
before
a
jury
and
certainly
before
this
tribunal
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
ample
evidence
to
sustain
a
jury
verdict
of
falsity.
now,
let's
get
to
the
question
of
the
association
of
the
police
commissioner
with
these
statements
in
the
ad.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
--
it
said
for
errors
and
misstatements.
and
there
was
no
--
nothing
in
the
ads
your
honor
even
suggesting
as
we
recall
it
that
there
was
--
that
there
was
any
--
any
truth
in
the
ad.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
alright,
sir.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
we
read
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
we
read
that
your
honor.
the
qualification
there
is
a
question
of
reference,
not
the
underlying
statements
in
the
ad.
we
say
that
that
ad
--
that
statement
qualifies
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
ad
can
be
read
as
referring
to
governor
patterson,
not
as
to
whether
or
not
the
underlying
subject
matter
of
the
publication
itself
is
true
or
false.
and
--
and
that
was
the
basis
for
--
for
my
statement
that
there's
no
attempt
in
that
to
say
that
any
of
this
ad
was
true.
they
simply
say,
"we
don't
think
it
can
be
read
to
refer
to
governor
patterson
but
we're
retracting
anyway
so
to
speak."
i
--
i
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
well
the
errors
and
misstatements
your
honor,
i
think
are
--
are
different
ways
of
saying
that
it's
--
that
it's
false.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
your
honor,
if
--
if
i
might
sir
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
could
i
call
your
attention
to
page
596
of
the
record
about
midway
down,
since
publication
of
the
--
for
its
--
its
just
before
folio
1715.
"since
publication
of
the
advertisement,
the
times
made
an
investigation
and
consistent
with
its
policy
of
retracting
and
correcting
any
errors
or
misstatements
which
may
appear
in
its
columns
herewith
retracts
the
two
paragraphs
complained
of
by
--
by
the
governor."
now,
we
say
that
there
is
no
qualification
there
as
to
any
part
of
those
paragraphs
being
true.
the
clear
implication
is
that
both
paragraphs
to
use
the
words
were
erroneous
or
misstated.
they
were
exactly
the
same
two
paragraphs
that
this
plaintiff
complained
about
and
we
say
as
the
alabama
supreme
court
said,
"if
it
was
false
for
patterson,
it
was
equally
false
for
sullivan."
and
this
went
to
the
jury
on
the
question
of
falsity.
now,
on
the
matter
of
association,
we
certainly
feel
that
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
that's
alright
sir,
i'm
--
i'm
glad
to
answer
the
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
that's
what
he
said
first
before
cross-examination.
but
then
he
said
--
then
on
cross-examination,
he
was
asked
whether
the
governor
and
this
plaintiff
were
not
on
a
par.
they
are
put
on
a
par
governor
patterson
and
this
plaintiff,
this
is
from
page
779
of
the
record,
"yes,
but
there
was
a
retraction
for
governor
patterson
and
there
was
no
retraction
for
this
plaintiff,
that
is
correct,
isn't
it?
answer:
that
is
correct.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
that's
as
--
that
was
the
first
thing
he
said
your
honor
but
then
he
said
that
they
were
on
a
par
in
this
regard
and
that
there
was
no
--
i
--
i
assume
the
jury
could
--
could
determine
from
that
that
there
was
no
greater
reference,
no
more
precise
reference
to
patterson
than
there
was
to
the
plaintiff
in
this
case.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
in
my
opinion
--
in
my
opinion,
everything
except
the
--
the
academic
discipline
of
expulsion
from
school
refers
to
mr.
sullivan.
if
--
it
--
we
think
can
reasonably
be
read,
in
fact,
irresistibly
read
as
describing
police
action
resulting
from
the
singing
of
my
country,
'tis
of
thee
from
capitol
steps.
and
mr.
sullivan
conceded
at
the
trial
of
course
that
he
had
no
academic
disciplinary
function
and
--
and
that
this
expulsion
of
course
does
not
refer
to
him.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
think
that
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it's
a
clear
sort
of
police
action
that
was
--
especially
in
view
of
the
earlier
reference
to
--
to
the
police
in
there.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
your
honor,
municipal
authorities
can
reasonably
be
construed
by
a
jury
to
the
state
authorities
too.
they
--
they're
police
authorities
within
a
state.
we
don't
say
that
a
reasonable
argument
can't
be
made
that
state
authorities
in
certain
context
don't
mean
police.
but
again
sir,
i
return
to
the
--
to
the
context,
this
is
a
question
of
whether
a
jury
could
reasonably
make
a
connotation.
and
we
say
certainly
that
police
authorities
in
state
can
--
can
or
reasonably
connote
to
the
average
ordinary
reader
which
is
the
test
that
the
jury
has
before
it
that
these
statements
have
reference
to
the
man
who's
in
charge
of
the
police.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
well,
we
--
we
simply
don't
because
the
--
the
respondent
conceded
at
the
trial
that
--
that
he
had
no
jurisdiction
in
that
regard
and
made
no
contention
whatever
at
the
trial
at
that
particular
statement
re
--
referred
to
him.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
he
would
in
certain
circumstances
where
--
whether
--
order
--
with
peace
and
order
were
threatened,
i'm
sure
he
would.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
your
honor,
in
paragraph
6,
we
would
like
to
advert
to
an
observation
which
justice
clark
made
and
which
was
--
was,
i
thought
rather
notably
underplayed
in
--
in
mr.
wechsler's
argument.
the
repeated
use
of
the
word
"they".
now,
here
i'm
not
relying
simply
on
my
analysis
or
a
hypothetical
analysis.
i
asked
on
cross-examination
a
witness
with
the
times,
mr.
aronson
whether
that
"they"
is
used
repeatedly
in
that
paragraph
refer
to
the
same
persons.
and
after
some
backing
and
filling,
he
stated
that
it
did
or
could
be
read
that
way.
now,
this
evidence
went
to
the
jury
and
it's
our
contention
that
a
--
an
ordinary
reader
of
--
of
normal
intelligence
knows
that
the
people
who
arrest
for
loitering
and
speeding
of
the
municipal
police.
there
is
no
attempt
made
in
this
paragraph
to
differentiate
in
any
manner
that
"they"
who
arrested
for
loitering
and
speeding
from
the
"they"
who
bombed
and
that
"they"
who
assaulted
and
the
"they"
who
indicted
for
murder.
we
don't
say
that
this
is
an
irresistible
connotation
in
all
contexts.
we
do
say
that
it's
not
only
is
a
reasonable
one
but
that
it
was
indeed
made
by
the
times
own
witness,
mr.
aronson
who
had
had
more
than
20
years
experience
in
a
screening
process
of
this
kind
of
editorial
type
ad
as
the
times
describes
it.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
what
the
--
the
thing
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
the
thing
that
would
prevent
in
alabama
your
honor
is
alabama
jurisprudence
which
requires
--
which
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
which
requires
that
a
group
be
sufficiently
small
so
that
the
identification
can
readily
be
made.
and
that
a
person
in
an
entire
community,
under
alabama
law
would
not
have
standing
to
sue
because
the
diffusion
of
--
of
the
attack,
the
diffusion
of
the
invidious
remarks
would
be
so
great
that
under
alabama
law,
it
could
not
be
applied
to
this
man
as
a
plaintiff,
a
member
of
a
community
with
no
other
identification
as
a
plaintiff
in
a
lawsuit.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i
think
it
would.
the
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
the
cases
which
--
which
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
cited
completely
in
these
matters
if
we
construe
them,
requires
what
--
what,
as
we
submit
most
states
do
that
where
you've
got
this
area
of
group
libel
or
--
that
has
to
--
that
the
group
has
to
have
a
--
a
bounds
or
--
and
in
alabama
reasonably
--
small
bounds
in
the
context
of
your
question
your
honor.
i
--
i
think
that
the
community
could
not
--
a
member
of
the
community
could
not.
but
i
don't
think
we
have
that
question
in
this
case.
i
think
that
the
--
that
the
association
is
--
is
certainly
clear
enough.
we
think
it's
very
clear
but
certainly
clear
enough
to
warrant
a
jury
finding
that
the
charges
of
this
sort
of
are
terrible
and
--
and
indefensible
police
action
reflect
on
the
man
who
is
police
commissioner
of
the
city.
and
i
don't
think
we
need
to
go
beyond
that.
i
think
sufficient
on
to
the
day
if
this
matter
arises
but
i
don't
think
it
would
arise
in
alabama
because
of
the
--
of
the
court's
restriction
in
this
matter.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
the
question
was
asked
earlier
about
the
police
chief.
i
would
say
that
he
could,
yes
sir.
though
i
do
--
i
do
say
that
--
that
an
elected
official
such
as
the
commissioner
has
a
large
notoriety
and
identification.
i
think
that
when
something
goes
wrong
in
a
massive
sort
of
way
like
this
that
people
think
of
the
--
of
--
of
the
mayor
and
the
council.
they're
the
ones
who's
suppose
to
run
the
city
and
when
something
like
this
happens,
they
are
the
ones
that
that
people
think
of
and
--
and
especially
that
at
election
time
and
that
sort
of
thing.
but
i
--
i
would
think
if
the
police
commissioner
could,
an
answer
to
an
earlier
question,
i
would
reaffirm
what
mr.
wechsler
said
the
statute
of
limitations
has
one,
that
it's
one
year
in
alabama
and
--
and
there
has
been
no
suit
by
the
police
commissioner.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
to
this
extent
your
honor,
one
of
the
witnesses
testified.
he
was
a
former
employer
of
mr.
sullivan.
mr.
sullivan,
as
the
record
shows,
had
formally
been
in
the
public
service
commission
of
alabama
in
--
in
the
transportation
safety
field
and
after
he
left
there,
before
he
was
elected
commissioner,
he
had
worked
for
a
truck
line
in
--
in
a
similar
capacity.
and
this
man
testified,
his
former
employer
that
if
he
had
believed
the
matters
contained
in
this
ad
that
he
would
not
reemploy
mr.
sullivan.
we
think
that
--
that
this
--
this
kind
of
thing
certainly
enabled
the
jury
to
find
it
in
the
future
long
after
this
man
could
come
back
into
court
and
ask
a
jury
to
give
him
some
special
damages
that
he
might
be
damaged
especially
in
this
regard.
but
in
the
sense
of
showing
any
actual
out-of-pocket
loss
of
money
at
that
time,
no
sir,
there
--
there
was
no
showing
to
that.
but
we
submit
that
the
jury
could
fairly
take
into
account
future
losses
of
--
of
earnings
of
that
sort
or
if
the
--
the
occasion
arose.
and
of
course,
we
also
--
i
--
i
don't
know
to
what
extents
your
honor
would
refer
to
--
to
what
we
call
general
damages
that
is
damages
for
--
for
injury
to
reputation,
for
hurt
feelings
to
that
sort
of
thing.
that
is
also
allowed
in
alabama
and
that
is
different
from
what
i
have
just
described
as
special
damages
and
then
of
course
in
addition
to
that,
there
are
punitive
damages.
and
i
would
like
to
remind
the
court
that
under
alabama
law,
there
is
a
very
broad
retraction
statute.
i
--
i
understand
from
--
i
believe
it's
mr.
chafee's
article
that
we've
cited
in
--
in
our
brief
that
alabama
and
virginia
were
two
of
the
earliest
states
which
enacted
these
retraction
statutes
and
that
a
--
that
a
defendant
in
alabama
can
eliminate
entirely
special
and
general
damages
as
i've
described
in
--
by
retraction.
the
times,
we
submit,
has
done
this
in
the
governor's
case.
it
refused
to
do
it
in
our
case
and
if
the
times
had
done
it,
the
times
had
done
for
this
plaintiff
what
it
did
for
--
for
governor
patterson,
it
would
not
be
in
the
situation
which
it
finds
itself
today.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we've
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
excuse
me
sir.
i
beg
your
pardon.
it
takes
out
punitive
and
--
and
general
and
leaves
in
special,
i
--
i'm
glad
you
corrected
me
on
that.
we've
cited
the
statute
on
page
68
of
--
of
our
brief.
it's
title
7,
section
915
and
--
and
makes
actual
damages
only
recoverable
where
there
has
been
a
retraction.
and
we
submit
that
that
this
plus
the
alabama
defense
of
fair
comment,
plus
the
absolute
defense
of
truth
in
alabama
are
means
which
alabama
were
they
not
only
the
constitutional
command
of
the
united
states
constitution
but
the
command
of
its
own
alabama
constitution.
the
accommodation
which
alabama
seeks
to
make
with
this
freedom
of
the
press
and
freedom
of
speech
but
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no,
sir.
oh,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i
believe
there
are
a
good
many,
sir
but
i
--
i
couldn't
say
exactly
how
many.
we
say
that
all
--
that
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
alright,
sir.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
your
honor,
the
--
the
two
reports
mr.
wechsler
talked
about
one
of
them.
first
report,
the
report
from
the
key,
the
stringer
said
that
a
passing
police
car
came
by.
mr.
wechsler
stressed
a
later
investigation
which
they
asked,
i
believe
a
month
or
so
later
where
it
said
that
at
one
time,
they
were
to
forward
in
large
numbers.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
but
i
will
assume
for
the
sake
of
the
hypothetical
what
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
may
--
may
i
be
sure
i
understand
the
--
the
question
correctly.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i
--
i
certainly
would
contend
that
a
retraction
of
--
was
--was
an
order
your
honor.
i
think
that
--
that
a
great
deal
or
more
of
the
ad
than
that
one
sentence
applies
to
this
plaintiff
and
we
alleged
it
into
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
well,
in
the
first
paragraph
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
in
the
first
paragraph
--
to
the
third
paragraph,
the
first
one
that
we
complained
about
other
than
the
unprecedented
wave
of
terror
in
the
preamble.
we
think
that
the
padlocking
does
refer
to
the
--
to
the
police
and
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
that's
right
sir
and
we've
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
and
then
in
the
--
in
the
other
paragraph
as
i've
stated
the
repeated
use
of
the
word
"they".
mr.
aronson's
testimony
that
"they"
refers
to
the
same
people,
"they",
arrest
for
loitering
and
speeding,
as
to
the
police
that
they're
the
same
people
who
did
that
either
participated
in
or
--
or
condoned
the
bombing
and
the
rest
of
it.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
that
was
the
question
i
attempted
to
answer
before.
i
--
i
still
think
that
the
rest
of
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
you
left
police
and
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i
--
well
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i
would
take
the
same
position.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i
would
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i
would
take
the
same
position
your
honor
and
i
would
be
in
accord
with
mr.
aronson
of
the
times.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
would.
not
as
much
possibly
but
certainly
he's
liable
and
certainly,
the
reference
we
submit
is
clear
enough
for
a
jury
to
find
especially
when
this
testimony
from
the
defendant's
own
witness
that
the
association
was
made
through
the
repeated
use
of
the
word
"they".
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
well,
police
action,
we
submit
is
clearly
described.
and
--
and
arrest,
we
don't
think
your
honor
that
you
got
to
say
the
police
arrest
in
order
to
--
to
contend
the
arrest
refers
to
the
police.
we
think
that
if
you
use
the
test
of
what
a
normal
intelligent
reader
understands,
that
a
normal
intelligent
reader
understands
that
arrest
are
made
by
the
police.
an
argument
can
be
made
that
private
person's
arrest
but
this
doesn't
mean
that
a
jury
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
has
defined
that
arrest
in
that
context
don't
relate
to
police.
on
the
question
of
malice
and
deliberateness
to
--
to
get
to
a
matter
that
mr.
justice
white
raised
earlier
in
the
argument,
we
submit
sir
that
there
was
plenty
from
which
the
jury
could
find
deliberateness.
we
think
that
--
that
the
inconsistent
treatment
of
--
of
governor
patterson
and
this
plaintiff,
the
treatment
of
this
plaintiff
after
investigations
showed
falsity.
the
treatment
of
this
plaintiff
by
the
testimony
of
the
secretary
telling
the
jury
that
it
was
not
substantially
incorrect
after
his
own
lawyers
couldn't
even
plead
truth,
the
failure
of
the
times
to
apply
a
very
rigorous
set
of
advertising
acceptability
standards
as
they
called
them.
they
--
they
--
that
booklet
is
in
evidence
and
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
sir.
and
--
and/or
beyond
that,
that
the
jury
had
before
it
a
deliberate
failure
of
the
new
york
times
personnel
of
people
who
are
put
on
the
stand,
who
were
brought
down
there
and
put
on
the
stand
by
the
defendant.
two
of
its
three
witnesses
were
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
we
think
this
evidence
on
which
a
jury
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no,
sir.
that
is
not
the
issue.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
oh
--
oh
yes
sir.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
we
do.
we
--
we
think
that
the
defendant
in
order
to
succeed
must
convince
this
court
that
a
newspaper
corporation
has
an
absolute
immunity
from
anything
it
publishes.
and
in
an
answer
to
one,
i
believe,
it
was
mr.
justice
stewart's
question.
i
--
as
i
understand
their
contention
and
as
i
understand
what
they
said
it
to
be,
if
a
newspaper
charges
or
let's
say
a
mayor
or
a
police
commissioner
was
taking
a
bribe
that
there
is
absolute
immunity
against
the
libel
suit
in
that
regard
and
we
think
that's
something
brand
new
in
our
jurisprudence.
we
think
that
it
would
have
a
devastating
effect
on
this
nation.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
you
mean
a
reasonable
belief
in
truth?
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no,
sir.
not
under
alabama
law.
it
would
have
to
be
true.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
they
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
say
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
was
ample
evidence
from
which
a
jury
could
find
that
there
was
the
kind
of
recklessness
and
abandon
and
an
inability
to
look
at
facts
at
the
beginning
before
publication
which
could
be
the
equivalent
of
--
of
intent.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
later
your
honor.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
after
--
after
knowledge
came
but
i
say,
even
before
that,
that
that
they
--
they
have
as
i
was
going
say,
these
advertising
acceptability
standards.
they're
suppose
to
screen
these
ads
under
newspaper
procedure,
not
under
alabama
law,
but
under
the
procedure
that
--
that
the
times
has
set
up.
they
brought
down
presumably
the
two
people
under
that
screening
process
who
were
supposed
to
look
at
this
ad
and
see
whether
it
passed
master
under
the
libel
laws
among
other
tests.
the
first
man
said
he
scanned
it
horridly,
this
is
mr.
aronson,
and
didn't
find
anything
offensive
in
it.
i
even
asked
him
whether
he
found
any
extravagant
or
superlative
language
and
he
said
he
did
not
even
though
the
ad
uses
the
phrase
unprecedented
wave
of
terror.
and
then
the
--
the
man
who
is
in-charge
of
the
department,
mr.
redding,
who
is
--
who
is
in-charge
of
the
advertising
acceptability
department,
was
put
on
the
stand
and
he
said
he
didn't
do
anything
at
all.
he
didn't
check
with
any
of
the
--
the
signers
of
the
ad.
he
--
the
times
specified
in
answers
to
interrogatories,
16
separate
news
articles
which
related
to
the
subject
matter
purportedly
described
in
this
ad.
we
asked
that
specific
question.
they
specified
16
stories
and
mr.
redding
said
he
didn't
look
at
one
of
them
before
this
ad
was
--
was
sent
off
for
publication.
and
so
at
that
stage,
we
say
there
was
a
recklessness
that
--
that
was
--
was
illegal
equivalent
of
intent.
and
then
beyond
that
as
mr.
justice
stewart
points
out,
we
have
the
retraction
for
one
and
not
for
the
other
in
precisely
similar
circumstances
and
that's
the
case
that
went
to
the
jury.
and
certainly,
the
intent,
we
submit,
of
the
author
of
this
ad,
the
man
who
wrote
it,
sent
it
in
and
paid
almost
$5000
to
have
it
published,
it's
a
paid
ad
in
the
new
york
times.
that
man
certainly
intended
as
he
testified
unequivocally
to
make
this
ad
as
devastating
as
possible
because
the
purpose
of
the
ad
was
to
raise
money
and
he
wanted
to
use
his
phrase
to
make
it
as
appealing
as
possible.
we
submit
that
the
--
this
court
and
no
other
courts
had
ever
made
a
distinction
between
libel
of
public
officials
and
libel
of
private
persons.
public
officials,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
pennekamp
have
a
right
to
sue
for
libel
when
they
have
been
defamed.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
there
were
no
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
your
honor,
under
alabama
practice,
a
jury
has
a
right
to
bring
back
a
general
verdict
as
distinguished
from
--
from
the
federal
practice.
the
times,
and
i
think
the
individual
defendants
asked
four
special
verdicts
but
the
court
--
we've
cited
several
alabama
cases
in
our
brief
which
say
that
under
alabama
practice,
a
jury
has
a
right
to
bring
back
a
general
verdict.
and
--
and
there
is
no
special
verdict
in
this
case
and
i
know
of
no
way
to
--
to
determine
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
what
they
deliberated
on.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
--
it
made
--
the
alabama
supreme
court
made
a
specific
finding
that
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
from
which
malice
could
be
found.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
they
found
it
or
they
--
they
found
that
--
that
the
--
that
matter
involving
mr.
--
mr.
bancroft.
the
--
i'm
reading
from
273
alabama
686.
"on
the
other
hand,"
during
his
testimony,
it
was
a
contention
that
--
that
the
times
mentioned
that
the
--
i
mean
that
the
court
had
mentioned
this
retraction
that
--
that
we
discussed.
“on
the
other
hand,
during
his
testimony
it
was
a
contention
of
the
secretary
of
the
times
that
the
advertisement
was
"substantially
correct."
in
the
face
of
the
cavalier
ignoring
of
the
falsity
of
the
advertisement,
the
jury
could
not
have
--
but
been
impressed
with
the
bad
faith
of
the
times
and
its
maliciousness
inferable
therefrom."
in
other
words,
once
all
of
the
facts
were
on
the
table
from
the
very
early
investigations
through
the
retraction,
through
the
conduct
of
the
times,
attorneys
in
the
trial
where
they
conceded
falsity,
the
secretary
nevertheless
and
in
the
face
of
all
that,
told
the
jury
that
this
was
substantially
correct.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
plaintiff
asked,
but
no
charges.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i
--
i
don't
believe
that.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
would
be
permissible,
so
we
--
we
ask
for
no
--
i
mean
i
--
we
--
the
plaintiff
could've
asked
for
a
directed
verdict.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i
--
i
don't
know
but
sir,
but
i'm
--
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
it's
been
abandoned
or
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
or
i
--
i've
--
i've
never
done
it
and
i've
never
seen
it
done
but
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
but
in
this
case,
there
was
no
requested
charge
from
the
--
the
jury
--
to
--
from
the
judge
to
the
jury.
in
this
connection,
we
would
like
to
point
out
again
and
answer
to
some
of
mr.
justice
white's
questions
to
mr.
wechsler
with
regard
to
charges
that
--
that
the
--
they
were
very
precise
exceptions
made
to
the
overall
charge
by
the
defendant,
new
york
times
and
none
of
them
are
related
to
any
of
these
--
these
matters.
we
--
we
submit
that
certainly
at
this
stage,
the
new
york
times
could
not
contend
that
there
is
any
deficiency
in
the
overall
charge
which
the
judge
gave
to
the
jury.
indeed,
it
makes
no
such
argument
in
these
briefs,
in
this
court
and
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
your
honor,
on
that
as
we've
argued
in
our
brief,
as
we
understand
the
cases
of
this
court,
it
has
not
heretofore
gone
into
the
question
of
the
excessiveness
or
inadequacy
of
damages.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
under
the
--
under
the
seventh
amendment.
the
c.
b.
&
q.
case
against
chicago
which
i've
cited
earlier
was
the
case
where
$1
was
brought
back
in
a
condemnation
case
against
the
railroad.
this
court
held
that
it
--
it
would
not
go
into
the
question
of
the
adequacy
of
that
award.
we
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
the
latest
case
on
this
question
of
damages
that
i
know
of
is
neese
against
southern
railroad
where
this
case
--
or
where
this
court
expressly
refused
or
declined
to
go
into
this
--
this
question.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i
--
well,
i
was
going
to
say
your
honor
that
--
that
we
--
we
would
--
we
will
concede
that
at
some
point,
you
get
into
a
question
of
whether
there
is
any
evidence
at
all
that
thompson
against
louisville
test
so
to
speak.
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
well,
we
think
that
the
--
that
if
this
court
went
into
the
question
at
all
as
we
submitted
has
not
heretofore
done,
the
question
would
be
whether
there
was
any
reasonable
basis
whatever
for
this
verdict.
in
our
brief,
we
have
pointed
out
situations
a
new
york
verdict
seven
times
as
big,
$3,500,000.
it
has
since
we
wrote
the
brief
and
cut
to
$550,000
by
the
appellate
division.
but
on
the
question
of
reason
--
sir?
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
faulk
against
aware,
inc.
it
was
a
case
in
which
this
publication
of
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
was
a
libel
case,
i
--
i
--
excuse
me
sir.
it
--
it
was
a
--
a
libel
case
and
as
i
say,
there
was
a
$3,500,000
award
in
that
case
and
the
times
itself
on
the
issue
of
reason
said
that
this
has
a
healthy
effect.
we
submit
that
in
--
in
the
context
of
this
case,
a
small
verdict
would
have
been
a
bagatelle.
it
would've
been
a
slap
on
the
wrist
to
the
times
for
this
sort
of
conduct
even
--
even
if
you
consider
this
as
being
entirely
punitive
damage.
and
it
would
--
mr.
m.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no,
sir.
it
was
against
a
much
smaller
publication
with
a
--
i
think
a
circulation
of
about
2000,
a
--
a
publication
with
obviously
nothing
like
the
prestige
that
this
ad
carried
all
the
news
it's
fit
to
print,
all
the
rest
of
it.
we
think
that
--
if
that
all
impel
a
large
and
substantial
verdict
in
this
case
which
the
jury
awarded.
thank
you
sir.
