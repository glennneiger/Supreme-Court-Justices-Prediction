because
the
judge
charges
at
the

that
this
is
libel
per
se.
and
then
on
page
824,
he
says,
"writings
libelous
per
se
carry
the
presumption
of
falsity
and
of
malice."
and
then
later
on
down
he
says,
"so
in
the
case
at
the
time
that
we
have
here
where
the
court
charges
you
that
this
is
libelous
matter,
that
this
libelous
matter
is
libelous
per
se,
then
falsity
and
malice
i
presume."
