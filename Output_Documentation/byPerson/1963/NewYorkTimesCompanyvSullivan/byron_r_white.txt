mr.
wechsler,
the
--
we
don't
have
here
a
case
of
a
deliberate
falsity

justice

so
we

we
don't
really
need
to

i
don't
suppose
that's
really
posed
here.
justice

(inaudible)
to

was

no

the

justice

mr.
wechsler,
what
is
the
fact
of
the
record
about
whether
the
times
--
whether
the
times
knew
these
--
these
statements
which
were
involved?
justice
byron

and
the
--
then
the
--
if
you
accept
the
supreme
court
of
alabama's
aversions
of

we
must
deal
with
your
broader
first

justice

and
we

if
you're

why
--
justice

why
--
justice
byron

mr.
wechsler,
was
there
an

made
out
in

for

decide
about

that

as
the
accuracy

with
punitive

or
--
justice

the
very
--
justice
byron

the

was
supposed
to
decide
that
when
(inaudible)

no
definition
of
punitive

of

the
relevance
acknowledged
through

the
way
the

was
tried,
it's
irrelevant
whether
it
was
true

whether
they
knew
it

not.
justice

and
then

in

white
(inaudible)
--
you
mean
re
--
you
mean
examine
the
facts?
justice
byron

white
but
i
suppose
if
--
(inaudible)
i
gather
it
is
that
libel
falls
out
the
--
outside
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
that
someone
has
to
finally
decide
what
is
libel
that
what

what
libel
is
that
falls
outside
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
the
alabama
law?
do
you
say
that
knowing
the
statement
is
false
at
the
outset
if
he
refused
to
retract
that,
you
know
it's
false?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
--
the
jury
would
get
him
up
the
stand
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
to
this
case
unavoidably
presents
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
--
a
person
may
tell
a
deliberate
lie
about
a
publication?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
is
that
the
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
the
--
but
that
--
that's
a
question
of
the
first
amendment
whether
the
--
whether
a
--
whether
you
may
publish
a
deliberate
lie
--
justice
byron

white
--
in
order
to
lie
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
about
a
public
official?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
(inaudible)
--
if
it
were
held
here
--
it
were
held
here
that
a
newspaper
could
publish
a
(inaudible)
which

this
must
be
true,
that
would
still
(inaudible)
justice

yes.
justice

but
on
the
(inaudible)
justice

white
--
this
case,
say
they
knew
it
was
false
or
(voice

justice
byron

white
what
--
where
in
the
record
--
was
there
any
way
of
finding
out
what
the
jury
found
or

justice
byron

or
any
other

or
any
other

or
any
other
alabama
courts
about
the
questions
(inaudible)
justice
byron

did
the
alabama

justice
byron

white
the
alabama
supreme
court
feels
it's
necessary
to
sustain
the
verdict
to
the
(inaudible)
justice

does
it
say
a
finding?
justice
byron

white
yes.
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
could
you
say
it's
a
--
it's
enough
evidence
on
the
--
the
fact
the
publication
to
get
to
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
other
evidence,
this
is
enough
evidence?
justice
byron

white
(voice

this
is
enough
to
survive
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
or
motion
for
dismissal
poses
it

poses
the
plaintiff's
case?
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
a
jury
verdict.
and
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
--
jury
verdict.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
then
it
must
be
true
that
if
the
defendant
does
put
on
substantial
evidence
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
but
nevertheless,
there
is
this
fact
that
he
failed
to
deny
at
a
certain
point
in
light.
that
also
is
enough
to
sustain
a
jury
verdict.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
had
the
scintilla
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
getting
to
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
--
justice
byron

white
(voice

justice
byron

white
(voice

common
law
rule
for
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
reviewing
a
jury
--
jury
verdict
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it's
against
the
evidence,
you'd
set
it
aside?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
--
in
your
supreme
court
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
much
this
amounted
to?
