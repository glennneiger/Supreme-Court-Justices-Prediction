is
that
(voice

justice

but
you
do,
as
i
understood
you
so
far,
if
in

you
had
conceded
or
review
their
mistake
or
inaccuracy,
the
word
"seventh."
justice
william

but
do
you
otherwise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

the
only
concession
you're
making
is
to
enact
it
in
using
the
word
"seventh."
justice
william
j.
brennan,

what
were
the
facts

the

i
take
it
was,
this
meant
that
sullivan
bombed
king's
home.
justice
william

well,
wasn't
that
issue
of
the
identification?
justice
william
j.

alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

what
was
the
actual
submission
to

whether

on

on
the
premise
that
if
they
found
that
anyone
of
the
statements
which
on
its
face
was
libelous
under
that
rule,
referred
to
sullivan.
they
could
bring
in
a
verdict
against
times.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

mr.
wechsler,
(inaudible)
is
the
size
of
the
award
peculiarly
important?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
what
i
really
meant
was,
i
--
i
take
it,
one
other
thing
that
you
think
really
trespasses
upon
first
amendment
rights
apart
from
anything
else
is
the
extent
of
which
these
practice,
this
jury
completely
at
large
in
fixing
--
in
arriving
at
an
award.
now,
my
point
was
whether
that
argument,
that
any
of
these
three
special
grounds
was
all
of
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

(inaudible)
in

argument
based

the
purpose.

(inaudible)
i
gather
he
was
the
times
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
now
you're
suggesting
that
whatever
he
may
have
said,
whatever
you
want
to
put
on
it
in
the
way
of
interpretation
that
this
was
evidence
to
the
jury?

may
we
reexamine?

why

i
don't
follow
it.
