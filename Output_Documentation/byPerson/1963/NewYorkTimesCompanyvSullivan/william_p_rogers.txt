mr.
william
p.
rogers
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
judge
pierce
and
i
represent
the
four
individual
petitioners
in
this
case
which
is
a
companion
case
to
the
one
that
was
argued
yesterday.
and
if
the
court
will
permit
us,
we
would
like
to
divide
our
time
as
far
as
the
argument
is
concerned.
the
courts
of
alabama
could
have
decreed
that
these
four
individual
petitioners
too,
should
be
punished
in
a
civil
libel
action.
no
actual
or
special
damages
were
awarded.
the
trial
court
in
charging
the
jury,
merely
said
that
punitive
damages
means
such
damages
as
are
given
as
a
kind
of
punishment
to
a
defendant
with
the
view
to
preventing
similar
wrongs
in
the
future
and
that
falsity
and
malice
are
presumed.
the
jury
responded
by
awarding
a
$500,000
punitive
damages
against
these
individual
petitioners
which
was
the
largest
such
judgment
in
the
history
of
alabama
up
to
that
time.
i
think
it'd
be
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
i'm
not
sure
that's
certainly
in
this
case,
there
was
no
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
i
think
it's
interesting
in
that
connection
your
--
your
honor
that
the
largest
fine
that
could've
been
imposed
in
a
criminal
libel
action
in
the
state
of
alabama
would
have
been
$500.
now,
what
did
--
what
did
these
petitioners
do
to
deserve
this
punishment?
a
precise
recital
of
the
evidence
brings
into
sharp
focus
the
petitioners'
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated.
the
petitioners
are
not
in
truth
being
punished
for
what
they
did
or
failed
to
do
in
this
case
or
what
they
said
and
did
elsewhere
and
who
they
are.
that
the
central
fact
of
this
case
is
that
they
are
being
--
drastically
punished
because
they
were
negroes
residing
in
alabama,
who've
had
the
courage
to
speak
out
in
the
struggle
to
--
to
achieve
the
rights
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
for
all
citizens
regardless
of
race
or
color.
indeed,
these
petitioners,
dr.
king
and
these
four
petitioners
are
the
leaders
of
the
civil
rights
movement
in
alabama.
what
was
the
proof
in
the
case?
in
the
testimony
offered
by
the
plaintiff,
there
were
only
two
brief
references
to
the
petitioners.
the
first
was
that
their
names
appeared
in
the
advertisement
as
published
by
the
new
york
times
in
march
29th,
1960.
the
second
was
that
a
few
days
before
this
suit
was
started,
each
received
identical
letters
from
the
plaintiff
demanding
that
they
publish
a
retraction.
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
petitioner's
authorized
the
use
of
their
names
in
the
advertisement.
there
was
no
evidence
that
they
were
members
of
the
group
or
committee
that
inserted
the
advertisement
in
the
paper.
and
there
was
no
evidence
that
they
had
any
knowledge
of
the
advertisement
at
all
that
appeared
in
the
new
york
times.
that's
all
there
was
to
the
plaintiffs'
case,
no
other
evidence.
the
defendants
then
proceeded
to
show
that
the
total
failure
of
proof
by
the
plaintiff
was
not
a
mere
oversight.
mr.
john
murray
who
is
a
volunteer
worker
for
the
committee
to
defend
martin
luther
king
in
the
struggle
for
freedom
in
the
south
testified
that
on
or
about
march
25th,
1960,
he
took
the
draft
to
the
advertisement
in
question
to
new
york
times
and
gave
it
to
a
mr.
aronson,
who
was
an
employee
of
the
paper.
mr.
murray
testified
that
in
addition
to
the
proposed
advertisement
with
the
names
of
a
large
group
of
individuals
and
a
letter
from
a.
philip
randolph,
saying
that
those
persons
were
signed
members
of
the
committee
endorsed
the
advertisement.
mr.
murray
and
mr.
aronson,
who
were
the
two
people
who
would
know
both
testified
at
the
trial
and
each
testified
that
the
names
of
these
four
petitioners
were
not
on
the
list.
mr.
murray
further
testified
that
the
executive
director
of
the
committee,
a
mr.
rustin,
some
time
later
after
the
original
advertisement
had
been
submitted
to
the
paper,
decided
that
he
wanted
some
prominent
names
from
the
south
to
be
included
among
the
sponsors.
so
he
proceeded
to
add
to
the
original
list
submitted
to
new
york
times,
some
names
from
a
list
he
had
in
his
desk
of
persons
who
belonged
to
the
southern
christian
leadership
conference,
an
entirely
separate
organization.
now,
because
he
was
anxious
to
get
the
advertisement
published,
he
decided
not
to
take
the
time
to
ask
the
individuals
for
permission
to
use
their
names.
all
of
the
petitioners
testified,
each
as
a
spiritual
and
religious
leader
of
his
people.
all
have
been
active
in
the
cause
for
civil
rights.
each
testified
though
that
he
had
not
been
and
was
not
a
member
of
the
committee
to
defend
martin
luther
king.
non-authorized
publication
of
the
advertisement
that
appeared
over
new
york
times
or
had
any
knowledge
of
the
advertisement
prior
to
its
publication,
the
cross
examination
was
brief
and
nothing
was
to
develop
--
was
developed
to
cast
any
doubt
on
the
accuracy
of
the
testimony
of
these
petitioners.
why
then,
it
might
be
asked,
was
such
harsh
punishment
imposed?
it
is
stated
that
it
is
because
the
petitioners
somehow
ratified
the
publication
of
the
advertisement.
after
the
publication
of
this
advertisement,
there
was
considerable
publicity
about
it
in
alabama.
it
was
finally
decided
that
several
lawsuits
should
be
commenced
by
certain
state
officials
but
there
was
a
difficulty.
respondent
and
others
like
him
obviously
had
no
actual
or
special
damages
and
a
mere
technical
victory
would
have
not
have
served
their
basic
purpose
of
the
litigation
which
was
to
intimidate.
so
how
could
they
accomplish
the
end
that
they
sought
whether
it
was
decided
to
base
the
lawsuits
on
title
7,
section
914
of
the
code
of
alabama
which
provides
that
a
public
official
in
order
to
recover
punitive
damages
must
make
a
written
demand
on
the
person
who
published
the
material
demanding
a
public
retraction
five
days
before
bringing
a
suit.
so
few
days
before
starting
this
lawsuit,
the
plaintiff
wrote
a
letter
to
each
petitioners
demanding
a
retraction
of
the
fall
--
false
and
defamatory
matter
published
by
you
in
the
new
york
times
on
march
29th
in
this
prominent
public
manner
as
the
original
publication.
parenthetically,
the
letter
only
set
forth
two
paragraphs
from
the
advertisement
and
these
were
out
of
context.
petitioner
according
to
the
testimony
never
saw
the
advertisement
until
the
lawsuit
was
started.
now,
none
of
these
petitioners,
after
they
received
this
letter
and
during
a
few
days
before
the
suit
was
started,
answered
the
letter
or
attempted
to
place
an
advertisement
in
the
new
york
times
saying
that
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
original
advertisement.
this
is
the
--
the
basis,
the
sole
basis
for
the
claim
of
ratification.
what
did
the
petitioner
say
about
it
when
they
were
asked?
well,
reverend
seay
was
asked
why
he
did
not
reply
to
the
letter.
he
testified,
and
this
on
page
789
of
the
record,
"well
in
the
first
place,
i
was
so
amazed
about
the
complaint
and
about
the
ad
that
i
was
afraid
to
make
any
reply
to
it
until
i
had
some
legal
advice
for
fear
i
might
incriminate
myself.
i
had
no
knowledge
of
it
whatsoever."
when
reverend
shuttlesworth,
page
789
of
the
record,
was
asked
why
he
did
not
reply
to
the
letter,
he
said,
"i
had
not
written
anything
to
be
retracted
as
the
letter
demanded
and
neither
had
i
seen
a
material
which
the
letter
call
upon
me
to
retract."
when
reverend
abernathy
was
asked
why
he
did
not
make
a
retraction,
he
replied,
"well,
i
didn't
make
a
retraction
number
1
because
i
did
not
publish
the
ad
and
i
felt
that
i
was
being
asked
to
retract
something
that
i
did
not
put
forth."
reverend
lowery,
who
--
page
802
and
it's
interesting
i
think,
in
this
case
that
he
didn't
receive
the
letter
demanding
retraction
until
after
the
complaint
had
been
receipt
--
had
been
--
had
been
served
on
him.
when
he
was
asked
the
question
he
said,
"as
i
recall,
the
letter
didn't
for
a
reply,
it
asked
me
to
republish
a
retraction
of
equal
size
or
something
like
that
to
an
ad
that
--
that
appeared
in
new
york
times.
i
had
no
knowledge
of
the
ad
and
so
i
could
make
no
retraction."
of
course,
the
claim
of
ratification
is
auspicious.
petitioners
were
under
no
obligation
either
in
law
or
as
a
matter
common
sense
to
publish
or
retraction
in
the
new
york
times
as
demanded
by
the
letter.
the
statute
which
--
which
is
relied
on
by
the
respondent
refers
only
to
publishers
of
the
alleged
libel.
it
does
not
require
persons
who
did
not
publish
a
libel
to
retract
it.
in
fact,
the
letter
from
the
plaintiff
recognizes
this
and
demands
retraction
of
the
defamatory
matter
published
by
you.
it
did
not
say,
retracted
defamatory
matter
--
i
warn
you
whether
published
by
you
or
not.
counsel
for
respondent
now
says,
that
it
was
the
petitioners'
silence,
not
their
failure
to
retract
for
which
they're
being
punished.
but
certainly,
the
letter
from
the
respondent
did
not
call
upon
the
petitioners
to
speak.
it
did
not
ask
for
a
reply.
it
demanded
a
retraction
in
the
new
york
times.
in
fact,
i
think
it's
interesting
to
notice
that
the
letter
which
is
really
the
basis
of
this
whole
lawsuit
was
--
gave
every
indication
of
being
a
"trick
and
device"
because
it
was
dated
march
8,
1960.
and
it
referred
to
something
that
--
that
appeared
in
the
new
york
times
on
march
29th,
1960
so
that
the
petitioners
in
reading
the
letter
quite
nastily
would
have
thought
it
was
a
trick.
it
was
dated
march
8
referring
to
an
advertisement
that
appeared
in
the
letter
that's
set
on
march
29.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
as
to
the
other
suit
your
honor
it
was
delivered
up
roughly
eight
days
before
the
litigation
was
started.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
that
is
correct
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
it
says
five
days.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
the
settled
law
of
alabama
is
that
mere
silence
concerning
it
does
not
create
liability
for
a
tort
committed
by
another
person
with
whom
there
was
no
agency
or
other
such
relationship.
the
alabama
rule
as
to
tort
as
declared
in
burns
against
campbell,
which
is
71
alabama
271,
and
w.e.
belcher
lumber
company
against
york
20
--
245
alabama
286.
ratification
occurs
only
as
the
court
said
in
the
belcher
case
where
the
relationship
of
agency
exists
and
the
principle
derives
a
benefit
from
the
act
beyond
the
scope
of
the
agency.
even
in
such
a
case,
ratification
occurs
only
after
the
principle
--
after
having
been
fully
informed,
fails
to
express
his
data
--
his
dissatisfaction
after
a
reasonable
time.
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
pointed
out
in
the
belcher
case
that
in
tort
cases,
mere
silence
or
non-interference
does
not
amount
to
a
ratification.
that
is
the
settled
law
of
alabama.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
in
leach
against
peirson,
this
court,
in
the
opinion
of
--
of
--
written
by
justice
holmes
held
that
a
man
cannot
make
evidence
for
himself
by
writing
a
letter
containing
the
statement
he
wishes
to
prove
and
then
claim
a
failure
to
answer
as
an
admission,
this
is
a
settled
law
too
in
alabama.
in
fact,
the
supreme
court
decision
in
the
leach
case
was
cited
and
relied
upon
in
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
in
fidelity
&
casualty
against
beeland
company.
now,
notwithstanding
this
--
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there
was
no
evidence
against
these
petitioners
and
they'll
--
that
the
law
of
alabama
makes
it
clear
that
silence
cannot
be
construed
as
--
as
ratification
of
a
tort
committed
by
another
who
is
totally
unconnected
with
the
person
concerned.
the
courts
of
alabama
have
found
a
judgment
of
$500,000
against
these
petitioners.
such
a
basis
for
imposing
liability
is
utterly
without
foundation
in
law
or
reason.
i
believe
that
any
fair
reading
of
the
record
causes
one
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
this
case
represents
a
perversion
of
the
judicial
process
with
no
evidence
to
support
the
verdict
and
the
case
has
it
--
as
its
purpose
the
intimidation
of
these
petitioners
and
others
like
them
who
speak
off
for
equality
and
justice
for
the
negro
in
alabama.
this
court
said
in
(inaudible)
that
it
retains
the
authority
to
nullify
action
when
it
encroaches
on
freedom
of
utterance
under
the
guise
of
punishing
libel.
the
court
held
in
garner
and
thompson
that
when
the
record
contains
no
evidence
to
support
a
finding
that
the
petitioners'
rights
of
due
process
of
law
have
been
violated.
now
that
is
this
case.
and
we
contend
that
the
petitioners'
rights
of
due
process
have
been
violated.
but
this
case
is
much
more
significant
than
merely
a
case
where
there's
no
evidence
to
support
a
finding.
it
is
clear
that
this
case
is
a
direct
attack
too
on
the
constitutionally
protected
rights
set
forth
in
the
first
amendment.
without
attempting
to
repeat
the
arguments
made
yesterday,
or
the
arguments
made
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
washington
post
and
the
chicago
tribune,
we
merely
submit,
one
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
advertisement
discloses
simply
an
attempt
to
speak
up
on
a
crucial
public
issue,
not
an
attack
on
any
individual.
and
two
that
freedom
to
criticize
and
comment
in
good
faith
upon
the
conduct
in
office
of
public
officials
even
if
overstated
and
exaggerated
is
constitutionally
protected.
otherwise
as
the
court
points
in
the
farmers
union
case,
all
remarks
even
faintly
objectionable,
would
be
excluded
out
of
an
excess
of
caution.
a
newspaper,
however
carefully
it
may
be
run
cannot
possibly
check
on
every
detail
and
every
statement
that
is
made
on
the
great
public
issues
of
our
time.
and
public
officials,
i
have
to
think
quite
naturally
that
the
arguments
of
--
and
the
statements
of
those
who
oppose
them
are
misleading
and
defamatory.
the
punitive
procedures
such
as
were
used
in
this
--
in
the
related
cases
were
readily
available
to
public
officials,
it
would
present
a
most
serious
threat
to
a
free
press,
possibly,
the
most
serious
threat
to
free
press
in
this
country
during
this
century.
if
this
case
should
stand,
many
newspapers,
magazines,
radio
and
television
networks
i
believe,
would
have
to
give
very
serious
consideration
to
limiting
their
circulation
or
coverage
to
certain
states,
otherwise
they
could
well
be
destroyed
or
severely
damaged
by
a
flood
of
punitive
litigation.
and
of
course,
it
goes
without
saying
that
such
a
result
would
be
most
destructive
to
our
national
interest
particularly
if
it
resulted
in
stifling
public
discussions
on
issues
such
as
civil
rights
and
the
other
great
issues
of
our
time.
this
case
is
not
merely
a
case
of
denial
of
due
process.
this
case
represents
a
federal
attack
under
the
guise
of
a
civil
libel
action
on
freedom
of
the
press
as
represented
here
by
the
new
york
times
yesterday
and
freedom
of
speech
and
assembly
as
represented
by
reverend
abernathy,
shuttlesworth,
seay
and
lowery.
it
is
the
violation
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
i
like
to
say
in
closing
my
remarks
that
three
of
these
petitioners
have
had
their
automobiles
seized
and
sold
at
public
auction,
sheriff
sale.
two
of
them
have
had
their
land
seized
and
sold
at
public
auction,
three
have
had
--
have
had
to
move
out
of
alabama,
all
have
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
and
money
in
this
and
related
lawsuits.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
that
--
i'll
attempt
to
find
out.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
mr.
nachman
says
no.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
your
honor.
well,
that
i
think
--
that
was
--
but
while
it
was
pending
on
appeal,
that's
alright.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
in
other
words,
three
of
them
have
had
their
automobiles
sold
at
sheriff
sale.
two
have
had
their
lands
seized
and
sold
at
public
auction.
three
have
moved
out
of
alabama.
all
of
them
have
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
and
money
in
litigation,
in
this
litigation
and
related
litigation.
now,
mr.
nachman,
rather
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
about
the
time
spent?
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
i
think
so
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
it's
in
the
--
i'm
--
i'm
sure
it's
printed
in
here
that
their
automobiles
have
been
seized
and
sold,
yes.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
i
could
your
honor.
this
court
said
in
bates
against
little
rock,
that
freedoms
are
protected
not
only
against
heavy
handed
fraudulent
acts
but
also
from
being
stifled
by
more
subtle
government
interference.
so
far,
in
this
case,
those
who
brought
the
case
has
had
been
successful.
if
this
judgment
is
permitted
to
stand,
it
will
be
a
mile
forerunner
of
what
will
follow.
we
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
dismiss
this
suit
and
in
so
doing
preserve
and
protect
the
constitutional
rights
of
these
petitioners
and
others
who
seek
not
to
defame
any
person
but
seek
simply
to
achieve
equal
rights
and
dignity
for
all
persons
regardless
of
race
or
color.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
your
honor,
i
just
have
a
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
--
one
or
two
brief
comments.
i
think
counsel
ended
his
remarks
by
saying
that
these
petitioners
reside
in
alabama.
the
fact
is
only
one
of
them
resides
in
(inaudible).
i
think
that
i
would
like
to
refer
to
the
answers
that
mr.
nachman
gave
to
the
questions
by
mr.
justice
black
because
he
left
the
impression
that
this
letter
from
--
from
mr.
randolph
even
though
hearsay
did
state
that
these
four
petitioners
had
authorized
this
publication.
now,
the
record
is
just
the
opposite
from
that.
in
page
807,
mr.
murray
testified
that
the
names
of
these
petitioners
were
not
included
in
that
list
and
mr.
aronson
at
page
755
who
was
the
other
witness
who
would
have
known
said
that
the
names
were
not
on
that
list
so
what
mr.
nachman
said
is
100%
different
from
the
truth.
the
truth
is
that
not
only
did
they
not
authorize
it
but
in
mr.
randolph's
letter,
their
names
were
not
included
at
all.
mr.
william
p.
rogers
well,
yes
he
did
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
--
your
honor
but
there
--
there
was
--
that
the
interesting
thing
about
that
is
the
other
witness
he
talked
about
was
a
mr.
redding
who
was
not
involved
in
the
original
transaction.
in
other
words,
mr.
murray
took
the
advertisement
in
the
randolph
letter
to
mr.
aronson.
mr.
murray
said
at
this
four
--
the
names
of
these
four
petitioners
was
not
on
that
list.
mr.
aronson
said
the
names
of
these
four
petitioners
were
not
on
that
list.
now,
the
other
man
that
he
referred
to
was
a
man
named
mr.
redding
who
subsequently
reviewed
the
advertisement
for
acceptability.
his
testimony
was
that
he
didn't
know.
in
other
words,
he
didn't
say,
"yes,
the
names
were
on
the
list."
he
said,
"i
don't
know.
i
don't
have
any
recollection."
so
there
wasn't
any
conflict
of
testimony
on
the
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
no,
that's
what
he
was
talking
about.
what
happened
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
of
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
yes,
your
honor.
i
can
give
you
the
--
mr.
william
p.
rogers
the
page
number
is
771
and
mr.
redding
said
that
he
did
not
know.
so
there
is
no
conflict
at
all.
now,
the
second
thing
that
i
thought
was
interesting
in
mr.
nachman's
statement,
he
said,
"now,
that
he
was
not
relying
on
the
statute."
in
other
words,
he
said
that
he
didn't
expect
these
petitioners
to
comply
with
the
statute
but
he
said
the
failure
to
say
anything
after
they
received
the
letter
in
his
view
was
an
admission
that
they
actually
had
authorized
the
advertisements.
now,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
they
all
denied
that
they
had
anything
to
do
with
it,
not
within
the
five
days.
what
if
he
--
if
he
doesn't
rely
in
the
statute
as
soon
as
they
were
served
with
the
complaint,
they
said
they
did
not
authorize
it
then
they
--
they
all
gave
depositions
and
then
new
depositions.
they
said
they
did
not
authorize
it.
they
didn't
even
know
anything
about
it.
so
very
quickly
after
they
received
the
letters,
they
made
it
perfectly
clear
to
the
public
and
to
mr.
sullivan
and
mr.
nachman
that
they
had
no
connection
at
all
with
this
advertisement.
so
that
the
arguments
he
makes
--
well,
interesting,
really
are
--
i
think
designed
to
deceive
the
court.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
these
petitioners
are
here
today
because
they're
negroes
and
because
they've
been
leaders
in
the
fight
for
civil
rights.
that's
all
there
is
to
this
case.
now,
he
--
when
--
when
justice
goldberg
asked
him
about
the
cases
in
--
in
alabama
which
he
relied,
it
seemed
to
me
he
--
he
didn't
answer
that
one.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
there
are
three
cases,
burns
against
campbell,
which
is
71
alabama
271,
belcher
lumber
against
york,
and
there's
fidelity
&
casulty
against
beeland.
now,
in
every
one
of
those
cases,
it's
made
perfectly
clear
that
the
law
is
that
in
a
tort
case,
mere
silence
does
not
make
you
guilty
of
a
tort.
there
is
no
case
in
alabama
that
suggest
that
and
mr.
nachman
didn't
really
--
he
just
--
adopt
the
issue
when
you
asked.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
in
that
--
in
the
--
in
the
beeland
case,
the
court
said
that
a
man
cannot
make
evidence
for
himself
by
writing
a
letter
containing
the
statement
he
wishes
to
prove
and
then
claim
failure
to
answer
as
omission.
that's
a
settled
law
of
alabama.
he
--
he
cited
the
birmingham
news
case.
the
birmingham
news
case
your
honor
is
a
case
where
the
birmingham
news
wanted
to
have
a
shopping
guide
published
and
it
employed
a
person,
gave
him
an
office
in
the
birmingham
news
company.
he
went
out
and
solicited
ads.
he
had
the
shopping
guide
printed.
the
printing
company
sued
the
birmingham
news
because
they
weren't
paid
for
the
printing.
they
had
set
the
bills
to
the
birmingham
news
because
they
thought
it
was
for
the
birmingham
news.
and
the
birmingham
news
didn't
deny
the
fact
that
he
was
an
agent.
he
had
an
office
in
the
building.
he
was
doing
their
work.
and
the
court
said
in
that
case,
because
of
the
relationship
with
the
party
and
because
it
certainly
appeared
that
he
was
not
an
independent
contractor
that
their
failure
to
claim
that
he
wasn't
after
they
received
the
bills
made
them
liable
for
the
work
that
they
had
done
in
behalf
of
the
birmingham
news.
now
that's
not
this
case.
and
when
counsel
states
that
case,
i
think
he's
trying
to
mislead
the
court.
in
conclusion,
i'd
like
merely
to
say
this
that
this
case
has
i
think
very
broad
significance
because
if
--
if
it
should
be
affirmed
or
--
let's
see
there
are
four
other
cases
now
pending
where
a
request
for
damages
amount
to
$2,500,000.
there
are
cases
pending
against
cbs,
damages
amount
to
$1,300,000.
there
are
other
cases
against
the
new
york
times
for
a
request
of
damages
of
$1,800,000.
and
if
this
case
should
stand
in
the
cause
the
civil
rights
will
be
set
back
a
great
many
years.
