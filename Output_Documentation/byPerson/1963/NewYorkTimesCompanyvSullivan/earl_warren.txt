mr.

chief

was
this
statement
considered
by

court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
one
you're
--
that
you're
objecting
to,
bringing
in
to
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
say,
was
that
considered
in
this
case
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
by
the
alabama
supreme
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
said
--
i
thought
you
said
that
this
was
dragged
into
the
--
into
the
case
before
the
alabama
supreme
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
court
and
this
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
the
counsel,
they
don't
object
to
this
to
--
to
this
transcript
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
incorrect.
they
object
to
what
was
actually
said
and
done
at
the
trail.
now
for
instance
--
for
instance,
what
i'm
taking
out
is
this,
counsel
said
that
the
judge
introduced
the
lawyers.
the
white
lawyers
as
mr.
so
and
so,
mr.
so
and
so
and
mr.
so
and
so
and
when
he
introduced
the
negro
lawyers,
he
introduced
some
as
john
jones,
frank
smith
and
so
forth.
they're
not
objecting
in
that
respect
to
an
incorrect
transcript.
they're
objecting
to
what
was
done
in
the
courtroom,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'm
--
i'm
just
talking
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
about
what
was
said
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
here
in
the
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
the
negro
--
negro
lawyers
in
that
case
members
of
lord
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
were
they
--
were
they
introduced
in
the
same
manner
as
to
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
other
mr.
--
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
--
that's
the
only
reference
he
makes
to
the
--
to
the
lawyers.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
any
--
are
there
any
instances
in
the
record
where
he
does
make
a
distinction
between
the
negro
and
the
white
lawyers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
does
he
make
a
distinction
in
the
paragraph
before
that
you
just
mentioned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
does
he
read
--
where
do
--
when
did
they
introduce
the
--
the
negro
lawyers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
lord
day
&
lord.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
case
in
alabama
precisely
in
point
on
this
question,
whether
multiple
--
multiple
defendants
and
--
and
they
were
all
set
for
hearing
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
a
particular
day
and
one
counsel
obtained
the
continuance
and
all
of
them
were
put
over?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
but
here
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
here,
you
have
--
do
you
have
a
case
precisely
in
point
here
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
with
multiple
defendants
where
--
where
the
action
taken
by
them
were
not
taken
by
them
as
the
same
as
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
when
the
judge
continued
these
motions
from
time
to
time,
did
he
continue
the
--
the
ones
for
these
defendants
as
he
did
the
one
for
the
new
york
times
or
did
he
then
and
there
say
--
say
that
these
defendants
are
out
because
they
have
not
appeared?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
--
did
the
judge
continue
the
motions
for
the
individuals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
didn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
didn't
he,
if
they
had
lapsed
that
they
hadn't
--
hadn't
appeared,
why
didn't
he
then
say
that
they
were
--
they
had
lapsed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
second
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
the
courts
so
construe
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
have
the
court
so
construed
your
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
that
have
satisfied
your
statute
if
he
had
--
if
he
had
just
written
a
letter
to
you
and
said,
"i
deny
that
i
had
anything
to
do
with
that
advertisement."
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
mr.
nachman,
it
is
not
unknown
to
at
least
one
member
of
this
court
that
he
receives
letters
from
various
parts
of
the
country
claiming
that
he
has
made
statements
that
are
libelous
on
certain
groups
or
certain
individuals
and
demanding
an
apology
for
it.
if
that
member
of
the
court
has
made
no
such
statements,
is
he
under
obligations
to
--
to
apologize
or
to
deny
that
he
made
any
such
statements
at
the
peril
of
being
sued
for
libel
and
having
that
offered
as
sufficient
proof
to
get
a
$500,000
verdict
against
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
they
were
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they're
far
worse
that
this
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'm
willing
to
make
it
just
as
specific
as
you
want
it
to
be
made,
where
in
fact,
the
--
the
person
i've
been
talking
about
has
made
no
such
statement.
is
he
obligated
to
deny
that
he
said
it
in
order
to
prevent
being
sued
and
--
and
recovered
against
for
libel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
charged,
now
when
you
say
charged,
are
you
--
you
mean
accused?
chief
justice
earl
warren
accused
by
an
individual.
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
--
not
charged
in
--
in
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
irrespective
of
the
character
of
the
libel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
is
there
imprisonment
connected
with
it
or
just
a
fine
of
$500?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
you
told
us
a
little
while
ago
that
it
was
not
tried
as
a
joint
case.
that
it
was
not
a
joint
action
and
that
therefore
all
of
the
counsel
had
to
be
present
when
they
put
over
the
motions
for
a
new
trial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
general
rogers.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
