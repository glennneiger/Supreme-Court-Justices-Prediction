mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
may
it
please
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
a
little
difficult
to
know
whether
i
should
discuss
this
case
or
another
case
that
was
tried.
the
record
of
which
is
not
before
this
court.
we
take
sharp
exception.
the
statements
of
judge
pierce
and
of
mr.
--
general
rogers
regarding
matters
which
we
say
and
we
say
--
we
say
correctly
are
not
involved
in
this
case.
matters
which
were
not
raised
at
the
trail
of
this
case
with
matters
which
had
most
were
presented
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
in
this
court
and
at
worst,
matters
which
don't
even
relate
remotely
to
this
case
but
to
another
case
that
was
tried
three
months
after
this
case
was
over.
if
i
may
begin
with
general
rogers'
argument
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
the
--
the
--
what
--
what
statement
was
it?
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
the
--
the
--
one
of
--
by
--
that
the
trial
judge
made?
that
--
that
was
the
one
i
was
referring
to
your
honor.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no
sir.
it
couldn't
have
been.
it
--
it
wasn't
even
in
the
record.
the
case
hasn't
even
been
appealed.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no,
sir.
what
i
--
i
meant
to
say
was
that
some
of
the
points
that
counsel
have
made,
not
that
particular
point
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
but
some
of
the
points
were
raised
for
the
first
time
before
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
they
were
not
raised
at
all
in
the
trial
court
when
this
case
was
tried
or
--
and
--
and
as
to
the
james
case,
i
think
i
can
dispose
of
that
quickly.
that
hasn't
even
been
appealed
your
honors.
that
there
--
there
is
no
record
of
that
case.
and
in
connection
with
records,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
goldberg's
question,
the
trial
court
does
not
and
did
not
approve
the
record
of
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
a
statutory
procedure
and
we've
cited
the
statute
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
"whereby
any
person,
any
party
who
has
an
objection
to
anything
that
is
transcribed
in
the
record
which
that
party
thinks
is
inaccurate,
he
can
make
an
objection
before
the
trial
judge.
and
then
the
matter
is
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
judge
and
the
trial
judge
rules
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
court
reporter
has
accurately
and
properly
transcribed
the
record."
but
in
the
absence
of
such
a
motion,
the
trial
court
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it.
that
the
--
the
record
in
alabama
is
certified
by
the
clerk
of
the
court
and
by
the
court
reporter
who
transcribed
the
testimony
and
that
is
it.
unless
there
is
an
affirmative
motion
made
by
a
party
objecting
to
any
part
of
the
record
as
being
improper,
the
trial
court
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
and
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
it,
it
wasn't
our
record.
the
times
had
it
prepared.
the
other
defendants
all
of
whom
were
defendants
jointly
in
this
lawsuit
are
--
are
appealed
and
it
was
their
record.
what
the
court
--
the
court
reporter's
designation
of
their
counsel
didn't
even
get
before
the
court
with
--
that
the
trial
court.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
wasn't
even
raised
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
where
over
80
assignments
of
error
were
made
by
these
defendants
and
that
we
submit
is
the
spurious
nature
of
these
objections
that
are
now
brought
before
the
highest
court
in
the
land,
matters
that
weren't
even
mentioned
below
much
less
raised
and
disposed
of
and
this
--
this
record
does
not
carry
the
stamp
of
approval
of
the
trial
court
because
there
never
was
any
occasion
for
him
to
consider
it.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no,
he
did
not
your
honor
and
there
was
nothing
in
--
this
--
this
is
a
court
reporter's
designation
in
a
record
that
was
transcribed
months
after
this
trial
was
over.
it
couldn't
possibly
have
had
any
effect
whatever
on
--
on
the
--
the
conduct
of
this
trial,
it
couldn't
have
gotten
before
the
jury.
it
--
it
was
simply
a
court
reporter's
designation
when
he
wrote
the
transcript
up
and
as
--
as
i
have
said,
there
was
ample
opportunity
for
these
petitioners
to
accept
to
the
record,
to
ask
the
trial
court,
to
direct
the
court
reporter
to
change
it
if
it
has
been
improper.
we
certainly
wouldn't
have
objected
to
it
or
--
or
--
but
it
wasn't
done.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
not
my
understanding
in
the
brief.
there
is
no
mention
made
of
any
address
to
any
counsel
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
on
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
in
--
in
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
sir.
in
oral
argument,
we
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
--
the
introduction
of
counsel
and
--
on
page
570,
every
member
of
the
firm
of
lord
day
&
lord
was
read
out
to
the
jury
and
this
is
5
--
page
570
and
then
the
names
of
the
attorneys
for
the
individual
defendants
and
there's
no
mister
in
any
of
them.
there
was
a
mister
used
in
the
preceding
paragraph,
there
was
none
in
this
paragraph
and
this
paragraph
includes
the
names
of
--
as
i
say,
of
every
single
member
of
the
firm
of
lord
day
&
lord,
this
is
outside
the
record
but
the
court
was
handed
a
letter
here
so
that
he
could
identify
each
member
of
the
firm
to
see
whether
there
was
any
connections
with
--
with
any
member
of
the
jury
or
venire.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no,
sir.
but
they
represented
the
other
defendants,
i'd
say
they
were
--
your
honor,
the
--
there
were
--
there
was
a
corporate
defendant
of
times
which
was
represented
by
lord
day
&
lord
and
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
some
alabama
counsel.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
and
then
there
were
four
other
defendants
who
were
represented
by
individual
counsel,
negro
lawyers
they
were
but
they
were
not,
as
your
honor
observes,
members
of
--
of
lord
day
&
lord.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
if
i
may
read
to
the
court,
gentlemen,
this
is
from
570
and
any
of
you
can't
--
to
any
of
these
members
of
the
firm,
lord
day
&
lord
of
new
york,
allen
foster,
sherman
bowen,
james
s.
hemingway,
herbert
brownell,
louis
m.
loeb,
thomas
f.
daley,
terry
j.
(inaudible)
and
so
on.
down
the
line,
the
lawyers
for
the
other
defendants
are
fred
gray
of
montgomery,
solomon
seay
and
v.
z.
crawford
of
mobile.
on
the
question
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i
--
i
assume
that
that
--
that's
what
he
had
in
mind.
i
--
i
believe
that
that
is
the
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
in
the
--
the
preceding
paragraph
as
i
pointed
out
to
the
court,
there
are
--
some
of
the
lawyers
are
called
mister.
but
in
the
next
paragraph
as
i
say,
when
he
read
all
of
the
names
of
the
def
--
of
--
of
the
members
of
lord
day
&
lord,
the
use
of
the
word
mister
does
not
appear
in
any
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
now,
the
lawyers
in
this
case
are
the
firm
of
steiner,
crum
&
baker.
mr.
nachman,
mr.
sam
rice
baker,
mr.
steiner
and
calvin
whitesell,
who
was
also
a
white
lawyer
associated
with
us
in
the
case,
not
referred
to
as
mister.
the
lawyers
for
the
defendant,
new
york
times
are
mr.
roderick
beddow,
mr.
embry,
mr.
thomas
daley,
of
new
york,
mr.
diana.
and
then
i
said,
"your
honor,
here
is
a
list
of
the
members
of
firm
of
lord
day
&
lord
of
new
york"
and
then
he
read
--
he
stated
what
i
have
just
read
to
the
court
leaving
--
reading
all
of
the
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
their
names
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
right
after
the
--
the
list
of
the
--
the
members
of
the
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
firm
lord
day
&
lord.
he
then
says,
"the
lawyers
for
the
other
defendants
are
fred
gray
of
montgomery,
solomon
seay
and
v
z.
crawford
of
mobile."
and
i
assume
that
this
is
what
counsel
had
reference
to
in
oral
argument.
as
i
say,
the
point
is
not
made
at
all
in
their
brief.
if
i
may
go
then
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
individual
defendants
as
--
i
will
refer
to
in
the
petitioners
here
who
were
jointly
sued
in
this
libel
suit
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
not
at
all
sir,
i
--
i
welcome
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
the
question
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
your
honor
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
your
honor,
that
--
that
is,
if
i
may
say
so
respectfully
sir,
a
partially
correct
reading
of
the
record
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
for
this
reason
sir
--
that
is
one
of
the
reasons.
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
lapsed.
another
reason
was
that
the
court,
the
trial
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
subsequently
held
that
under
alabama
practice,
long
established,
the
only
matters
it
can
be
--
considered
by
a
trial
court
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
matters
that
are
contained
within
the
record,
unless
the
ground
for
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
is
newly
discovered
evidence.
if
newly
discovered
evidence
is
one
of
the
grounds
for
motion
for
a
new
trial,
then
the
party
moving
may
seek
to
introduce
evidence
in
support
of
its
motion.
but
if
that
is
not
the
ground
and
this
of
course
was
not
the
ground,
then
the
court
may
not
consider
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
matters
which
were
not
part
of
the
trial
record.
now,
this
--
this
was
--
this
point
was
reached
for
the
new
york
times
because
it
kept
its
motion
alive
so
to
speak.
the
point
was
never
reached
for
the
individual
defendants
because
they
allowed
--
allowed
their
motion
to
lapse.
and
this
is
why
i
say
sir
that
--
that
your
--
your
observation
was
partially
correct
even
if
they
had
kept
their
motion
alive
--
their
motions
alive,
they
still
would
not
have
been
able
to
introduce
any
evidence
outside
the
record
which
did
not
deal
with
--
with
newly
discovered
evidence.
on
the
question
of
lapse
while
i'm
on
it,
we
think
the
cases
that
we've
cited
your
honors
are
crystal
clear.
and
i
state
what
has
long
been
the
law
of
alabama,
they're
cited
in
footnote
4
on
page
5
of
our
brief,
"that
it
is
incumbent
on
a
--
on
a
party
moving
for
a
new
trial
either
to
submit
for
consideration
by
the
court
within
30
days
or
to
get
a
continuance
for
resetting
within
a
30-day
period."
if
this
is
not
done,
the
cases
as
i
say
are
crystal
clear
and
of
long
standing,
the
motion
is
as
the
alabama
supreme
court
calls
it,
"discontinued".
and
this
is
what
happened
to
their
motions.
these
--
these
defendants,
the
times
on
the
one
hand
and
the
individual
defendants
on
the
other
tried
their
cases
completely
--
separately
throughout.
they
were
represented
by
a
different
counsel,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
were
frequent
objections
in
the
record
by
times'
counsel
to
questions
that
the
individual
petitioner's
counsel
asked
and
all
that
sort
of
thing.
and
if
there
was
to
be
any
--
any
joint
protection
so
to
speak,
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
the
times
possibly
should've
taken
it.
but
certainly,
there
is
no
requirement
that
where
there
are
several
defendants,
that
if
one
does
one
thing,
it's
presumed
that
he
does
it
for
all
of
the
rest
of
the
defendants
in
the
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
principle
contentions
as
the
court
has
obviously
recognized,
one
of
the
principal
contentions
in
the
case
on
the
part
of
the
individual
defendants
was
that
the
times
had
published
their
names
on
this
ad
without
any
authority.
and
there
was
quite
a
difference
of
--
of
--
of
a
position
at
the
trial
throughout
on
this
matter.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
your
honor,
this
--
this
was
not
exactly
the
fact
in
--
in
--
in
this
case.
they
had
not
been
set
for
hearing
or
--
on
--
on
a
particular
day.
the
time
--
the
motions
were
filed
and
then
they
were
continued.
the
times
i
believe
continued
its
motion
to
for
--
i
think
three
times
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
from
--
they
--
they
were
heard
in
march
and
--
and
the
trial
concluded
in
--
in
november.
there
must've
been
at
least
that
--
that
many
times.
we
submit
your
honor
that
the
case
as
we've
cited,
deal
with
any
defendant
and
any
motion
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
for
a
new
trial
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
what?
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
the
cases
that
we've
cited
do
not
as
i
recall,
deal
with
multiple
defendants
but
there
is
no
difference
made
in
--
in
alabama
practice
where
--
whether
there's
one
or
--
or
several
defendants.
in
other
words,
it
is
incumbent
on
the
movement
to
present
his
motion
for
hearing
within
30
days
and
if
he
doesn't,
he's
got
to
get
a
continued
for
setting
within
a
30
day
period
otherwise,
it's
discontinued
and
we've
cited
cases
that
--
that
go
back
a
considerable
number
of
years
in
alabama.
it's
--
it's
a
--
a
well
established
rule
of
alabama
practice.
we
--
we
will
certainly
if
--
if
the
court
would
like
or
--
or
attempt
to
give
the
court
a
--
of
a
case
where
there
are
joint
defendants
but
we
do
not
think
it
makes
any
difference,
your
honor.
in
--
in
other
words,
it's
--
it's
what's
incumbent
on
the
movement
in
connection
with
his
motion
for
new
trial.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
these
defendants
did
get
one
continuance
separately.
they
didn't
depend
on
the
new
york
times'
continuance
but
the
first
time
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
--
was
--
when
the
motions
for
new
trial
were
--
were
continued,
the
times
got
its
motion
for
new
trial
continued
and
these
petitioners
got
their
motions
continued.
that
happened
once
and
then
the
next
time,
the
times
got
its
motion
continued
and
the
individual
petitioners
did
not.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
once.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
they
had
not
lapsed
the
first
time
your
honor
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
the
--
the
--
the
second
time
there
was
--
there
was
no
--
when
--
when
the
matter
came
on
for
hearing,
the
trial
judge
announced
that
the
individual
petitioner's
motions
had
lapsed
and
for
--
i
--
i
was
going
say
proceeded
to
hear
the
times'
motion.
actually,
i
think
the
times'
motion
was
heard
and
then
the
counsel
for
the
individual
petitioners
sought
to
bring
theirs
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
the
court
announced
that
--
that
theirs
was
discontinued
or
was
dead
to
use
the
--
the
--
the
colloquial
list.
but
there
was
one
continuance
by
the
individual
petitioners,
quite
separate
from
the
new
york
times
and
certainly
indicates
again
that
that
they
were
handling
their
case
on
a
separate
basis
and
were
not
riding
the
--
the
times'
coattails.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
it
was
endorsed
on
their
motion
your
honor
by
the
trial
court.
he
just
--
the
--
the
record
show,
he
just
wrote
on
the
--
the
last
page
of
the
--
of
the
motion
and
separate
motions
were
filed
and
he
wrote
on
that,
continued
to
such
and
such
a
date.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
there
was
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
it's
--
it's
by
statute
and
by
--
or
--
or
judicial
decision,
we've
cited
the
statute
and
the
decisions
on
--
as
i
say
on
--
in
footnote
4
on
page
5
of
our
brief.
the
--
the
statute
is
title
13,
section
119
and
we've
cited
three
alabama
cases
and
many
more.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
sir,
the
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
this
--
the
statute
requires
that
they
be
filed
within
30
days.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
then
the
decisions
require
that
if
they
are
not
submitted
within
the
30-day
period,
they
must
be
continued
for
setting
within
a
subsequent
period.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no
sir,
this
is
(inaudible)
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no
sir,
it's
not
discretionary.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
it
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
the
--
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
held
that
this
cannot
be
waived.
it
is
not
a
matter
of
discretion
and
matters
have
come
before
the
alabama
supreme
court
where
a
counsel
have
even
attempted
to
agree
that
the
--
that
the
case
will
not
be
discontinued
and
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
held
that
this
is
not
a
matter
for
agreement
of
counsel.
if
there
has
been
no
continuance
--
no
continuance,
the
matter
is
discontinued
and
dead
as
a
matter
of
--
of
law
and
--
and
cannot
be
revived
by
agreement
of
counsel.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
and
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
in
cases
dealing
with
--
with
the
question
of
continuance
of
motions
for
new
trial,
yes
sir.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it's
--
its
--
its
--
its
entirely
jurisdictional.
on
the
--
on
the
question
of
--
of
the
identification
of
or
connection,
if
i
--
if
--
if
there
are
no
further
questions
on
--
on
this
--
this
point
of
the
--
these
individual
defendants
with
this
ad
because
i
certainly
will
not
burden
this
court
with
another
discussion
of
--
of
the
libelous
nature
of
the
ad
and
the
falsity
and
the
malice
and
all
of
the
matters
that
--
what
were
discussed
yesterday.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
would
think
so
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no
sir,
i
--
i
don't
think
they
do
and
--
and
the
underlying
constitutional
questions
on
the
--
the
nature
of
the
ad
and
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
--
i
--
i
assume
that
they
are.
and
--
and
these
of
course
were
joint
tort
pieces
but
were
sued
for
libel.
the
theory
for
suing
the
individual
petitioners
was
their
names
were
on
the
ad
as
people
do
warmly
endorse
the
material
which
preceded
it.
and
i
must
confess
that
i
am
a
little
confused
by
what
seems
to
me
to
be
the
dichotomy
in
the
contentions,
the
counsel
for
petition
is
made.
on
the
one
hand
they
say,
"we
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
ad,
we
knew
nothing
about
it,
we
didn't
do
it."
on
the
other
hand,
they
say,
"this
judgment
punishes
us
for
expressing
ourselves
in
this
ad."
now,
it
can't
work
both
ways.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
we
submit
that
the
--
that
the
second
alternative
is
the
correct
one.
that
this
was
their
publication
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
not
at
all
sir
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
they
could've
sent
a
letter
to
the
new
york
times
to
be
published
in
the
letters
to
the
ad
at
the
column
of
the
new
york
times
saying,
"this
ad
appeared
in
our
columns,
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
it,
please
publish
this
letter
in
the
new
york
times",
and
it
would
have
had
exactly
the
same
circulation
that
this
ad
had
and
it
would've
cost
the
--
the
price
of
a
--
of
a
postage
stamp.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
then,
i
think
we
would
have
quite
a
different
situation.
these
people
would've
done
all
that
they
could've
done
within
reasonable
means.
and
i
do
want
to
address
myself
since
the
question
has
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
we
--
we
think
it
would
have.
we
think
an
attempt
to
--
to
publish
a
statement
and
to
give
it
circulation
in
--
in
that
fashion,
would
certainly
have
met
the
--
the
requirements
of
the
statute.
but
obviously,
this
is
a
hypothetical
situation
because
they
didn't
attempt
to
do
it.
but
we
say
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
it
could've
been
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i
don't
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i
don't
of
no
--
i
--
i
don't
know
of
any
case
right
on
point
on
this
your
honor.
that
is
whether
a
letter
to
the
editor
would
have
satisfied
the
statute
giving
retraction
the
same
circulation
of
this
ad.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
but
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
your
honor,
there
--
there
was
no
occasion
for
such
an
instruction
because
they
didn't
do
anything.
if
they
had
done
this
and
it
made
the
contention
that
by
doing
it,
they
complied
with
the
statute,
we
would've
had
one
situation
but
these
defendants
testified
without
exception
that
they
did
nothing.
and
so
we
have
--
we
don't
have
a
situation
where
they
attempted
to
comply
and
--
and
to
give
a
retraction
of
--
of
the
same
publicity
that
the
ad
itself
had
had
and
--
and
we
think
that
by
that
very
simple
expedient,
these
petitioners
could
have
given
publicity
to
the
fact
that
they
retracted.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
alright
sir.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
and
i
will
retract
my
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
alright,
sir.
i
was
just
going
to
address
myself
to
that.
first
of
all,
their
names
were
on
the
ad.
secondly,
a
demand
for
retraction
was
sent
to
them.
the
demand
for
retraction
said,
to
--
to
paraphrase
it,
"you
published
a
defamatory
ad
about
us,
about
me",
the
--
the
plaintiff.
now,
under
the
rules
of
evidence,
alabama
has
them
and
it's
a
common
rule,
if
an
inculpatory
statement
or
charge
is
made
to
a
person,
in
circumstances
which
would
ordinarily
call
for
a
reply
and
the
person
doesn't
reply,
he
doesn't
deny
the
charge
contained.
that
failure
to
deny
in
those
circumstances
is
considered
evidence
of
the
fact
that
the
person
did
what
he
was
charged
with
doing.
in
this
case,
publishing
this
defamatory
statement.
now,
this
is
different
from
the
question
of
retraction.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no,
sir.
no.
there
are
others,
i
--
i
was
just
--
in
addition
to
that,
there
was
a
letter
from
a.
philip
randolph
setout
on
page
587
of
the
record.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no,
sir.
he
was
either
the
chairman
or
some
official
of
this
committee
and
this
letter
was
written
to
the
times
saying,
"the
people
on
the
list
attached
to
this
letter
have
authorized
the
use
of
their
names
and
furtherance
of
the
work
of
this
committee."
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
well,
it
--
it
may
have
been
--
the
letter
came
in
to
evidence
as
part
of
the
answers
to
interrogatory,
there
was
no
objection
to
it
and
so
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
the
--
the
letter
was
attached
your
honor
as
a
--
as
an
--
an
exhibit
--
as
an
answer
to
one
of
the
interrogatories
which
were
propounded
to
the
new
york
times.
interrogatory
was,
"what
authority
did
you
have
for
using
the
names
of
these
people
on
the
ad?"
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
and
the
answer
was
--
yes,
sir
but
if
the
--
if
these
individual
defendants
did
not
object
as
they
didn't
object,
the
answer
went
into
evidence
and
there
was
no
request
to
restrict
it
to
anybody.
there
was
no
objection
to
it.
it
went
into
evidence.
it
went
before
the
jury
and
there
was
no
objection
to
--
to
that
letter.
now,
there
was
a
conflict
of
testimony
as
to
whether
or
not
there
were
two
lists
of
names
attached
to
the
--
the
randolph
letter.
the
--
the
petitioners
maintained
and
their
witness
murray
testified
that
there
was
one
list
and
then
later
a
subsequent
list
of
names
was
added
to
that
list.
and
that
their
names
were
on
the
subsequent
list
and
were
not
included
in
the
original
randolph
authorization.
on
the
other
hand,
mr.
redding
who
testified
for
the
new
york
times
and
the
times
makes
this
observation
on
page
16
of
its
brief.
mr.
redding
who
was
in
charge
of
the
advertising
acceptability
department
said,
he
did
not
recall
any
two
lists.
that
far
as
he
knew,
there
was
no
difference
between
the
lists,
a
conflict
of
testimony
which
went
to
the
jury
on
that
point.
so
we
say
that
--
that
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
then
there
was
the
ratification.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
sir,
though
--
that
--
that
is
the
--
that
that
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no
sir.
and
--
and
we
would've
had
difficulty
taking
his
deposition
because
of
the
state
boundaries.
i
mean,
he
--
he
was
--
he
was
not
a
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no,
sir.
nor
was
he
produced
by
the
defendants
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
in
this
case.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
sir.
if
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
if
a
hearsay
--
if
any
kind
of
testimony,
hearsay
or
otherwise
is
--
is
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
oh,
oh
excuse
me
sir.
it
--
the
--
the
letter
was
admissible
as
answers
to
the
interrogatory
of
the
times
which
was
introduced
in
evidence
without
objection.
and
it
went
to
the
jury
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
sir.
and
there
was
no
objection
to
it
by
these
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
sir,
the
--
the
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
the
question
was
read.
the
question
was
read
to
the
jury.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
what
was
the
authorization
for
the
use
of
the
names
on
the
ad,
clearly
indicating
that
this
was
a
purpose
for
which
the
answer
would
then
be
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
that
was
the
same
case
your
honor
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
if
there
was
a
proper
request
your
honor
to
restrict,
but
if
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
sir.
if
--
if
--
if
--
if
somebody
introduces
hearsay
evidence
and
there's
no
objection
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no
sir,
we
didn't.
we
--
we
did
not
restrict
the
introduction
of
it.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
not
specific.
really,
the
matter
didn't
come
up
that
way.
we
simply
introduced,
we
--
the
interrogatory
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
we
have
the
--
the
--
the
fact
that
their
names
were
on
the
ad
and
we
have
the
fact
that
they
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
failed
to
reply
to
the
--
the
inculpatory
statement
which
was
made
in
the
demand
for
retraction.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
and
that
is
of
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
we
--
we
don't
say
that
that's
all
we
have
sir.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
and
--
no,
sir.
but
we
say
that
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
the
rule
of
evidence
which
is
not
peculiar
to
alabama.
that
a
failure
to
reply
to
an
inculpatory
statement
made
in
circumstances
which
would
normally
call
for
reply
can
be
considered
as
evidence
of
the
fact
that
the
person
did
what
the
charge
said
he
did.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
sir.
they
certainly
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
sir,
they
did.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
all
of
them.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes.
that
--
there
was
a
--
we
--
we
concede
a
square
conflict
of
--
of
--
of
the
testimony
on
it,
each
one
of
the
petitioners
testified
that
he
had
no
connection
with
the
ad
at
all.
didn't
know
anything
about
it
and
hadn't
authorized
the
use
of
his
name.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
also
put
on
this
man,
murray,
who
testified
that
their
names
were
brought
on
as
an
--
as
an
afterthought
to
lend
the
--
a
local
people
to
the
--
to
the
ad.
but
we
say
that
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
that
testimony
be
believed,
the
other
testimony
not
be
believed.
and
if
these
people
be
heard
to
say
that
their
pretrial
conduct
which
was
at
war
with
the
position
that
they
took
at
the
trial
was
so
little
worthy
of
credence
that
a
jury
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
couldn't
believe
it.
it
would've
been
an
easy
matter
for
them
to
have
said
in
response
to
this
demand,
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
ad.
we
didn't
know
anything
about
it.
mr.
commissioner
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no
sir.
we
separate
ratification
from
this
argument
that
--
that
there
are
two
separate
arguments.
the
one
is
that
a
failure
to
deny
in
these
circumstances
is
positive
evidence
and
the
fact
that
it
was
done,
not
that
it
was
ratified
later
but
that
it
was
actually
done.
we
say
that
if
somebody
sends
a
letter
saying,
"you
published
a
defamatory
statement
about
me",
and
--
and
the
recipient
hadn't
published
it.
didn't
know
anything
about
it
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
he
--
his
--
his
--
he
should've
answered
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
sir.
we
say
he
should've
answered
saying,
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i'm
not
talking
about
the
retraction
statute
now,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'm
talking
about
the
--
that
the
--
the
rule
of
evidence
that
--
that
a
failure
to
deny
a
charge
in
certain
circumstances
can
be
evidence
of
the
--
of
--
or
--
or
to
the
effect
that
the
charge
is
correct.
now,
as
far
as
retraction
is
concerned,
that
requires
an
actual
retraction
of
--
of
the
material
that
was
contained
in
the
ad.
what
i
say
is
to
avoid
the
evidentiary
effect
of
a
failure
to
deny
publication,
they
didn't
have
to
retract.
all
they
had
to
do
is
say,
we
didn't
publish
it.
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
not
where
there
is
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
not
where
there
is
a
demand
under
alabama
law.
where
a
demand
is
made,
then
there
is
a
requirement
that
it
be
answered
and
of
course,
that
there
need
be
no
relationship.
for
example,
if
one
person
runs
into
another
with
an
automobile
and
a
says
to
b,
"you
were
speeding
and
hit
me",
and
b
doesn't
deny
it,
that
can
be
evidence
of
the
fact
that
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
that
b
was
speeding.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no
sir.
but
what
we
say
is
that
where
there
is
a
--
a
--
a
--
a
charge
that
you
published
something
about
me
which
was
defamatory
and
--
and
so
on
that
if
there
was
no
publication,
there
is
a
--
an
obligation
and
not
an
obligation,
but
if
it's
not
answered,
it
can
be
considered
as
evidence
to
the
fact
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
that
there
was
a
publication.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i
--
i
don't
know
sir,
we
cite
a
massachusetts
case
in
--
in
our
--
our
brief,
gould
against
kramer
which
is
on
all
of
course
with
a
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
we
submit
that
it
is
and
has
been.
we've
cited
in
our
brief
on
page
21
a
massachusetts
case
of
--
of
some
age
which
is
--
is
right
on
point.
and
the
--
and
the
alabama
cases
of
the
--
the
alabama
case
--
supreme
court
in
this
case
has
followed
the
same
thing.
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
parks
case
that
the
matter
that
has
been
brought
here
on
--
on
certiorari
and
which
has
not
yet
been
ruled
on
reach
the
same
conclusion.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
your
honor,
we
submit
that
--
that
--
that
there
--
there
are
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
we
respectfully
and
in
addition
to
that
on
the
question
of
ratification
which
we
also
contend
provided
a
basis
for
the
judgment
against
these
individual
defendants.
they're
quite
the
contrary
to
the
argument
that
was
made
by
counsel
for
petitioners.
there
is
no
requirement
in
alabama
and
there
is
no
requirement
generally
that
there
be
a
preexisting
agency
relationship
before
there
can
be
ratification.
mr.
seavey
(ph)
in
the
restatement
of
agency
says,
"there
need
to
be
no
preexisting
agency
relationship."
we've
cited
that
in
our
brief
and
contrary
to
what
counsel
argued,
alabama
requires
no
preexisting
agency
relationship
to
birmingham
news
company
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
makes
it
perfectly
clear
but
we've
cited
in
footnote
18
on
page
23
of
our
brief,
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
there
need
to
be
preexisting
agency
relationship
in
order
for
there
to
be
ratification.
and
i
believe,
the
question
was
asked
--
answered
in
--
in
response
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
about
whether
there
were
some
equal
protection
matter
involved
because
in
this
case,
there
was
no
preexisting
agency
relationship
and
ratification
was
found.
whereas
in
other
alabama
cases,
the
court
had
held
that
there
had
to
be
a
preexisting
agency
relationship,
this
is
simply
not
the
case
your
honor.
and
the
birmingham
news
case
which
we
cited
on
page
23
in
footnote
18
so
holds
and
was
so
interpreted
not
only
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
but
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
parks
against
the
new
york
times
--
new
york
times
against
parks
as
it
is
here,
which
was
--
the
same
case
were
cited
in
the
court
of
appeal's
decision.
so
we
say
that,
in
addition
to
these
items
of
evidence,
we
also
have
ratification.
and
we
say
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
your
honor,
of
course
--
obviously,
i'm
not
familiar
with
--
with
the
content
of
the
letter
but
this
letter
sir
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
specified
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
but
--
but
--
this
letter
mr.
chief
justice,
specified
a
particular
publication
by
date,
they
quoted
from
a
part
of
it.
it
--
and
--
and
in
that
kind
of
a
circumstance,
as
distinguished
from
a
general
kind
of
a
comment,
"you
libel
me",
so
to
speak,
without
any
real
specification
of
what
was
done,
i
think
there
would
be
a
distinction
sir.
but
in
this
case,
the
demand
for
retraction
actually
specified
it.
it
said
that
you
published
this
ad
in
the
new
york
times
on
march
29,
1960,
saying
specifically
this
and
it
quoted
two
paragraphs
from
it,
the
two
paragraphs
which
were
--
were
discussed
at
some
length
yesterday
and
--
and
--
and
referred
to
the
ad
as
a
whole.
i
believe
them
that
there
should
be
a
distinction
between
a
generalized
kind
of
a
statement
in
the
letter
and
--
and
a
statement
in
the
letter
referring
to
a
specific
publication.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
but
we
--
we
would
contend
your
honor
that
if
somebody
is
charged
with
making
a
specific
publication
and
if
it
becomes
important
at
a
lawsuit
later,
whether
or
not
he
has
made
this
publication,
whether
he
had
anything
to
do
with
it.
that
his
failure
to
deny
in
response
to
such
to
a
demand
can
be
considered
as
evidence
of
the
fact
that
he
did
actually
publish
the
material
that
he
was
charged
with
publishing.
and
we
don't
say
there's
an
obligation
sir,
but
we
say
that
--
that
it
is
within
the
rule
of
evidence
that
if
a
person
is
charged
with
doing
something
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
sir.
in
--
in
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
(inaudible)
--
oh
no
sir,
i
didn't
charged
in
court
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
or
in
any
criminal
sense
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
but
--
but
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
receives
a
lot
of
such
as
these
or
demand
for
retraction
saying,
you
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
you
published
this
about
me
in
a
--
in
an
ad
in
the
new
york
times
on
such
and
such
a
date
saying
doesn't
so,
and
quoting
from
part
of
the
--
of
--
of
the
publication,
we
demand
that
you
retract
it.
and
if
the
person
then
takes
the
position
at
the
trial
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
publication
at
all.
he
didn't
--
he
didn't
know
anything
about
it,
had
--
had
no
connection
with
it.
we
say
that
the
fact
that
he
did
not
deny
that,
that
he
did
not
reply
and
did
not
say,
"i
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
publication.
my
name
was
used
without
authorization.
i
knew
nothing
about
it",
and
so
on
that
if
he
doesn't
disavow
the
fact
that
he
published
it,
not
the
content
of
the
ad
but
the
fact
that
he
published
it,
then
we
say
that
that
comes
within
this
rule
of
evidence,
yes.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
sir,
we
have
this
scintilla
rule.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
alabama
your
honor
has
the
scintilla
rule.
i
don't
know
whether
we're
the
only
state
in
the
union
which
has
it
(inaudible)
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
it
--
it
is
enough
to
get
to
the
jury.
now,
alabama
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
sir.
that
--
that
--
the
--
the
parties
cannot
be
heard
to
say
that
his
pretrial
conduct
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
position
that
he
later
takes
at
the
trial,
namely
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
ad.
that
--
that
--
that
--
that
his
pretrial
conduct
is
so
little
worthy
of
credence
that
the
jury
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
can't
even
consider
it.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
sir.
but
then
we
get
into
a
question
of
whether
a
jury
verdict
is
against
the
great
weight
of
the
evidence,
not
whether
there's
enough
to
get
to
the
jury.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
we
do
sir.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
on
getting
to
the
jury.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
but
alabama
says
that
even
though
you
can
get
to
the
jury,
the
court
can
still
set
aside
a
verdict
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
being
against
the
great
weight
of
the
evidence
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
that
--
that's
right
sir.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
that's
right
sir,
but
in
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes.
yes
sir.
but
in
this
case
your
honor,
under
alabama
law,
the
--
the
--
the
--
the
court
has
made
a
distinction
between
what
you've
got
to
have
to
get
to
a
jury
and
what
a
trial
court
on
motion
for
new
trial,
can
do
to
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
that
--
that's
one
against
the
great
weight
of
the
evidence
is
usually
the
one.
but
in
this
case
--
in
this
case
we
remind
the
court
and
we've
cited
that
the
cases
in
our
brief.
where
there
is
no
motion
for
new
trial,
the
court
cannot
consider
the
weight
of
the
evidence
and
as
has
been
pointed
at
some
length,
these
motions
for
a
new
trial
lapsed
and
the
question
of
excessiveness
and
the
question
of
the
weight
of
the
evidence
was
--
is
--
is
therefore,
gone.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
well
you
have
to
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
we
would
have
had
to
establish
that
this
was
a
libelous
publication
and
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
and
that
it
was
false
and
defamatory.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
and
--
well,
we
would've
had
a
presumption
of
malice
or
--
or
--
which
could
be
of
course
rebutted
by
evidence
from
the
defendant.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
from
falsity,
yes
sir.
but
a
rebuttable
presumption
and
of
course
the
proof,
the
burden
of
proof
would've
been
as
in
criminal
cases
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
other
than
more
probable
than
that
of
--
by
a
fair
preponderance
of
the
evidence
as
--
as
is
the
test
in
a
civil
case.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i
believe
its
$500,
your
honor.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i
--
i
think
that's
correct,
i
don't
believe
that
--
that
there
are
gradations
of
--
of
penalty
under
the
alabama
criminal
libel
statute.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i
believe
its
fine
and
possibly
up
to
--
is
it
six
months?
it's
a
--
it's
a
misdemeanor
i
think
under
--
under
alabama
criminal
law.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no
sir.
there
would
be
no
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
it
does
not
sir.
it
certainly
does
not.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
and
on
that
question
i
would
also
like
to
correct
what
i'm
sure
was
an
inadvertent
error
by
general
rogers
on
the
question
of
when
there
was
an
attachment
--
whether
an
attachment
had
been
made
after
there
was
an
--
an
attempt
to
review
in
this
court.
that
--
that
was
general
rogers
as
i
understood
him
said
that
that
had
been
the
case
but
an
attempt
has
been
made
after
review
had
been
--
review
proceedings
had
been
instituted
here.
this
incorrect
not
only
had
there
been
no
review
proceedings
instituted
here
but
there
hadn't
been
any
review
proceedings
instituted
in
alabama.
and
moreover,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
of
this
case
about
those
attachments.
the
only
thing
that
--
that
appears
in
--
in
these
volumes
are
some
newspaper
stories
which
the
times
attempted
to
introduce
in
support
of
its
motion
for
a
new
trial
which
were
excluded
by
the
trial
court
under
the
--
the
rule
that
i
mentioned
earlier
that
only
matters
going
to
newly
discovered
evidence
can
be
introduced
to
amplify
a
record.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
sir,
but
they
were
--
before
there
was
even
an
appeal
to
the
alabama
supreme
court,
they
came
after
the
motions
for
a
new
trial
lapsed
and
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
sir.
there
were
executions
in
the
judgment.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
there
was
no
supersedeas
bond
at
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
that's
right
sir.
and
if
the
cases
goes
the
other
way
on
--
on
--
on
appeal,
they
get
their
money
back
with
6%
interest
under
--
under
alabama
law.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no
sir.
it's
been
paid
in
to
court.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
it's
in
the
court,
yes.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i'm
guessing
your
honor,
i
believe
it's
around
$6000
but
i
--
i
--
it
--
it
--
it's
somewhere
in
that
--
in
that
neighborhood.
i
--
i
--
i
don't
know
the
--
remember
the
precise
amount
but
i
think
that's
reasonably
accurate.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
your
honor,
we
--
we
think
it's
a
--
it's
a
fairly
serious
matter
when
--
when
a
public
official
says
to
a
person,
"you
published
in
--
the
first
one
in
times"
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
we
--
we
--
we
think
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
we
don't
think
that
either
on
this
issue
or
on
ratification
your
honor,
a
preexisting
relationship
is
required.
we
think
that
alabama
stands
for
that
and
we
think
that
mr.
seay,
his
restatement
states
the
law
generally
on
that
and
that
a
preexisting
relationship
is
not
required.
on
the
other
matters
that
--
the
--
the
question
of
the
courtroom
in
the
atmosphere
at
the
trial
and
other
matters
that
--
that
--
that
are
raised
even
including
the
question
of
whether
the
trial
judge
was
properly
elected.
these
things
we
submit
were
complete
afterthoughts
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
--
with
--
with
--
with
the
--
the
record
in
this
case.
they
are
not
--
they
were
not
--
none
of
these
matters
were
raised
before
the
trial
court
even
if
these
people
had
not
let
their
motions
for
new
trial
lapsed.
we
say
they
would
not
have
been
properly
presented
because
these
are
things
that
should
be
presented
at
the
time,
not
on
motions
for
new
trial
later.
and
not
in
this
case,
we
think
they
are
smoke
screens
for
this
case,
we
think
the
sole
question
that
these
people
attempted
to
raise
which
deal
with
federal
due
process
was
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
enough
evidence
to
connect
these
people
with
the
publication
of
this
ad
to
get
to
a
jury
and
that
we
submit
is
the
sole
federal
question
that
was
raised
in
this
record.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
you
mean
the
nature
of
the
publication
is
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
libelous?
yes
sir.
i
--
as
the
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
excuse
me
sir.
i
--
i
--
i
should
have
made
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
that
clear,
in
addition
to
the
matters
that
were
involved
in
the
times
case.
i
--
i
should
have
made
that
clear.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
yes
sir,
the
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
that
--
that's
right
sir.
but
how
the
matters
of
--
of
the
--
of
--
of
who
was
sitting
where
in
a
courtroom
or
how
a
trial
judge
was
elected
or
what
a
trial
judge
said
three
months
after
a
trial
and
those
things
could
have
been
raised
by
the
matters
of
--
in
the
manner
that
--
that
--
that
the
petitioner
say
they
were
raised
as
contrary
to
any
known
rule
of
practice.
you
can't
raise
things
like
that
by
demurrer
or
by
motions
for
a
directed
verdict.
these
--
these
are
things
that
--
that
--
that
requires
specific
motions
going
to
those
specific
matters
and
they
simply
aren't
in
this
case
nor
is
there
in
this
case
what
may
be
in
another
libel
suit
and
we
--
we
think
that
whether
another
libel
suit
is
--
is
a
--
a
--
a
valid
one
or
a
groundless
one
is
not
before
the
court
in
this
case.
this
case
should
be
heard
and
we
are
confident
it
will
be
heard
on
its
own
merits.
these
were
joint
defendants
your
honors,
under
alabama
practice,
a
jury
could
not
even
if
it
had
wanted
to
apportion,
culpability
or
damage
among
several
defendants.
we've
cited
in
our
brief
the
case
of
--
of
bell
against
riley
truck
lines
where
a
jury
as
a
matter
of
fact
tried
to
apportion
damages
among
joint
tortfeasors
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
says,
"this
cannot
be
done.
that
is
part
of
a
general
verdict
by
a
joint
tortfeasors
who
are
sued
jointly,
the
jury
must
bring
back
a
joint
verdict
against
those
--
whom
it
finds
guilty
or
--
that
are
liable
in
--
in
--
in
a
civil
case."
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
your
honor
we
have
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
i
--
i
--
i
don't
have
offhand,
i'll
be
glad
to
supply
a
memorandum
on
that
if
--
mr.
justice
if
--
if
--
if
you
would
like.
i
--
i
don't
have
it
at
my
fingertips
the
leading
case
on
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
criminal
libel
but
i
--
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
--
i
will
be
glad
to
do
that.
we
submit
that
the
nature
of
this
ad,
the
culpability
involved
and
all
of
the
matters
which
we
discussed
yesterday
require
an
affirmance
of
this
case.
as
a
joint
case,
we
do
not
think
it
is
a
separate
case,
we
think
it
was
tried
as
a
joint
case.
it
was
appealed
as
a
joint
case
and
we
submit
that
as
joint
tortfeasors,
there
should
be
an
affirmance
as
to
all
defendants
here
petitioners
in
this
case.
mr.
roland
nachman,
jr.
no
sir.
i
said
that
there
were
--
what
i
meant
to
say
sir
was
--
was
that
there
were
separate
theories
of
defense
on
the
part
of
the
--
the
--
the
different
defendants,
individual
defendants
on
one
--
one
side
and
the
new
york
times
on
the
other.
the
--
the
--
the
trust
of
the
--
the
evidence
of
--
of
these
individual
defendants
was
really
the
--
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
publication
of
this
ad.
it
was
tried
as
a
joint
case,
yes
sir.
but
--
but
they
--
they
had
different
attorneys
and
each
was
looking
out
for
the
interest
of
his
own
clients,
that
was
what
i
meant
to
say.
we
would
like
to
--
to
--
to
leave
with
the
court
in
closing
the
observation
which
we
made
yesterday,
ask
the
court
to
bear
in
mind
that
here
we
have
four
individual
defendants
who
reside
in
alabama.
two
of
them
resided
in
montgomery.
there
was
not
one
word
of
evidence
from
anyone
of
these
defendants
that
any
part
of
this
ad
was
true.
and
we
ask
the
court
in
weighing
this
case
to
bear
in
mind
that
not
only
did
the
times
put
in
--
failed
to
put
in
any
evidence
of
truth
but
did
not
one
of
these
individual
defendants
did
either.
and
they,
even
more
than
the
times,
were
in
a
position
to
know
what
the
true
facts
were.
we
ask
that
both
these
cases
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
