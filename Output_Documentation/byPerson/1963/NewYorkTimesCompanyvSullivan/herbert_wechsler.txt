mr.
herbert
wechsler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
together
with
number
40
on
writ
of
certiorari
granted
a
year
ago
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
it
summons
for
review
a
judgment
of
that
court
which
poses
in
our
submission
hazards
to
the
freedom
of
the
press
of
a
dimension
not
confronted
since
the
early
days
as
the
republic.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
thank
you.
i
was
saying
that
the
writ
calls
for
review,
a
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
which
in
our
submission
poses
hazards
for
these
--
freedom
of
the
press,
not
confronted
since
the
early
days
of
the
republic.
the
questions
presented
are,
in
general,
first,
how
far
the
civil
law
of
libel
may
be
used
by
state
officials
to
punish
the
publication
of
statements
critical
of
their
official
conduct
or
of
the
conduct
of
the
agencies
of
which
they
are
in-charge.
and
second,
how
far
a
state
may
force
a
newspaper
which
publishes
a
thousand
miles
away
to
defend
libel
actions
instituted
in
its
forum
because
its
correspondents
go
there
on
occasion
to
cover
news
of
national
importance
as
--
for
a
very
small
amount
of
advertising
emanates
from
sources
in
the
state
and
a
very
small
circulation
of
the
paper
in
this
instance,
394
copies
of
the
total
daily
circulation
of
650,000
found
its
way
into
the
state.
the
problems
arise
in
this
context.
the
action
was
instituted
by
the
respondent,
mr.
l.b.
sullivan,
one
of
the
three
elected
commissioners
of
the
city
of
montgomery,
alabama.
it
was
brought
against
the
times
and
four
codefendants
who
were
then
residents
of
alabama,
four
clergymen,
the
reverends
abernathy,
shuttlesworth,
seay
and
lowery.
these
are
the
petitioners
in
number
40.
the
complaint
demands
damages
of
$500,000
for
libel
allegedly
contained
in
two
paragraphs
of
a
full
page
advertisement
that
was
published
in
the
times
on
march
29th,
1960.
i
should
say
that
similar
actions
based
on
the
same
advertisement
were
instituted
by
the
other
two
city
commissioners
by
a
former
commissioner
and
by
the
then
governor
of
the
state
of
alabama,
governor
patterson.
they
had
dominance
in
these
other
suits,
total
$2
million.
but
this
was
the
first
of
the
five
cases
brought
to
trial
and
it
resulted
in
a
verdict
in
a
judgment
against
all
defendants
for
the
$500,000
claim.
of
the
other
cases,
only
the
james
case,
the
case
by
mayor
james
has
gone
to
trial,
there
was
the
same
verdict
there
but
that's
pending
on
motion
for
new
trial
in
the
state
of
--
in
the
alabama
court.
the
other
three
cases
were
removed
by
the
times
to
the
united
states
district
court.
the
removal
was
sustained
by
the
district
court
but
remand
was
ordered
in
a
divided
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
and
that
case
involving
the
order
of
remand
is
also
pending
in
this
court
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
number
52
of
this
term.
the
publication
claims
of
libel,
the
respondent
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
he
was
the
commissioner
who's
called
the
mayor.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes
sir.
one
of
the
three
commissioners.
and
that
case
of
course
was
not
removed,
that
was
after
a
verdict.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
it's
pending
in
the
circuit
court
of
montgomery
county
on
an
--
is
yet
undetermined
motion
for
new
trial
presumably,
being
held
pending
the
decision
of
this
court
here.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
it
was
mr.
justice.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
it
was.
the
publication
which
the
respondent
claims
to
have
libeled
him
was
attached
to
the
complaint
and
it's
most
readily
available,
in
facsimile
form
at
the
back
of
our
brief.
since
in
my
submission,
the
case
not
only
begins
with
the
publication
but
ends
there
as
well.
i
respectfully
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
text.
as
it
shows
upon
its
face,
it
was
an
advertisement
published
on
behalf
of
an
organization
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
it's
in
appendix
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
--
to
the
brief
mr.
justice
douglas
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
--
which
of
course
is
a
facsimile
copy.
this
--
is
the
--
it’s
reproduced
as
the
way
it
looked
in
the
times
when
it
was
published
as
well
as
the
text.
it
was
published
on
behalf
of
the
committee,
the
name
of
which
is
on
the
bottom
which
was
called
the
"committee
to
defend
martin
luther
king
in
the
struggle
for
freedom
in
the
south."
chairman
of
the
committee
was
a.
philip
randolph,
the
president
was
--
the
co-chairman
was
gardener
c.
taylor,
dr.
taylor
of
new
york.
the
other
offices
of
the
committee
are
listed
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
that
includes
such
names
as
father
ford
and
dr.
fosdick.
the
members
appear
under
the
statement,
"your
help
is
urgently
needed
now."
some
60
names
of
well-known
people,
actors,
lawyers,
clergymen,
politicians
like
norman
thomas
and
the
name
of
mrs.
roosevelt.
the
object
of
the
publication
was
to
obtain
financial
support
for
the
three
needs
and
i'm
now
quoting,
which
was
stated
in
the
last
paragraph,
the
paragraph
beginning,
"we
urge
you
to
join
hands."
and
those
needs
are
put
as
the
defense
of
martin
luther
king
who
i
should
add
was
then
facing
trial
for
perjury
in
montgomery,
alabama.
the
funds
for
his
defense
for
the
support
of
the
embattled
students
and
the
struggle
for
the
right
to
vote,
these
are
the
stated
goals
of
the
solicitation.
the
recitation
in
the
text,
these
10
paragraphs,
the
small
type,
is
of
course
a
statement
designed
to
support
this
cause.
the
lead
caption,
"heed
their
rising
voices"
is
a
phrase
that's
taken
from
a
new
york
times’
editorial
of
some
days
earlier
as
--
is
indicated
at
the
top
right
hand
corner
where
there's
a
quotation
from
the
editorial,
which
indicates
accurately
the
sympathy
with
which
this
newspaper
has
viewed
the
negro
protest
demonstrations
in
the
south.
the
text
itself
begins
with
the
assertion
that
thousands
of
southern
negro
students
are
engaged
in
wide-spread
non-violent
demonstrations
in
positive
affirmation
of
the
right
to
live
in
human
dignity
as
guaranteed
by
the
united
--
u.s.
constitution
and
the
bill
of
rights.
and
it
proceeds
to
claim
that
in
their
efforts
to
uphold
these
guarantees,
they're
being
met
by
an
unprecedented
wave
of
terror
by
those
who
would
deny
and
negate
that
document
which
the
whole
world
looks
upon
as
setting
the
pattern
for
modern
freedom.
now,
the
succeeding
paragraphs
recite
a
series
of
alleged
abuses
visited
on
student
demonstrators
in
some
dozen
southern
cities
including
montgomery,
alabama.
then
the
paragraphs
go
on
to
praise
dr.
martin
luther
king
jr.
as
a
symbol
and
the
inspiration
of
the
movement
to
allege
that
his
peaceful
protest
had
been
answered
by
what
the
ad
calls
the
“southern
violators”
with
intimidation
and
violence
designed
to
remove
him
as
a
leader.
they
urged
the
importance
of
defending
dr.
king
and
the
need
of
a
material
help
by
those
who,
in
the
language
of
the
advertisement,
are
taking
the
risks
facing
jail
and
even
death
in
glorious
reaffirmation
of
our
constitution
and
its
bill
of
rights.
i
suggest,
therefore,
that
the
text
was
thus
a
statement
of
protest,
that
ad
coelum
interwoven
to
be
sure
with
a
recitation
of
events.
but
it
names
no
names
but
dr.
king's
and
plainly
makes
no
personal
attack
on
any
individual.
and
reading
it
in
this
way,
the
--
noting
the
prominence
of
the
name
to
some
of
the
signatories,
the
employees
of
the
times
who
received
it,
received
the
copy
and
the
order
for
its
publication
from
a
new
york
advertising
agency
who
received
it
of
course
in
new
york,
approved
its
publication
as
what
is
called
a
newspaper
parlance
in
editorial
type
advertisement,
and
so
that
publication
appeared.
now,
the
respondent
claimed
in
the
complaint
and
the
court
and
jury
found
that
he
was
libeled
by
the
third
paragraph
of
the
advertisement,
the
paragraph
that
begins
in
montgomery,
alabama
and
by
the
first
eight
lines
of
the
sixth
paragraph,
at
the
bottom
of
the
middle
column,
the
words
that
begin
again
and
again,
"the
southern
violators."
those
were
the
portions
of
the
advertisement
set
forth
in
the
complaint
in
which
the
action
was
based.
turning
from
the
complaint
to
the
record,
the
respondent's
evidence
showed
that
this
third
paragraph
beginning
in
montgomery,
alabama
was
indeed
inaccurate
in
some
particulars
and
i
would
like
to
state
as
faithfully
as
i
can,
what
those
inaccuracies
were.
it
was
shown
by
the
evidence
which
i
might
say
consisted
and
it's
a
very
imposing
record
which
proves
to
be
much
less
difficult
than
it
seems
because
a
great
part
of
it
consisted
nothing
but
the
reproduction
of
newspaper
stories
that
were
published
by
the
new
york
times
in
which
the
respondent's
claim
showed
it
was
doing
business
in
alabama
but
about
at
least
half
of
these
five
volumes
consist
of
nothing
but
those
stories.
the
--
the
evidence
in
the
libel
action
was
all
in
the
second
volume
and
it
doesn't
run
to
more
than
--
than
a
couple
of
hundred
pages
actually.
it
might
be
--
be
helpful
if
i
said
that
it
runs
from
pages
567
to
818,
the
whole
case
on
the
merits
is
in
those
pages.
now,
i
say
the
respondent's
evidence
which
consisted
principally
of
reports
that
were
made
to
the
new
york
times
by
its
investigators
after
this
controversy
started
and
the
suit
was
threatened
or
instituted,
the
times
had
claude
sitton,
it’s
atlanta
correspondent
and
a
lad
named
mckee,
who
was
a
stringer
in
montgomery,
investigate
what
had
happened
and
these
reports
came
in.
they
were
then
obtained
on
discovery
by
the
plaintiffs
and
put
into
the
record
and
they
really
constitute
the
--
i
shouldn't
say
the
whole
because
the
respondent
cuddles
with
this,
but
i
say
the
heart
of
the
case
as
to
what
actually
occurred.
now,
what
it
shows
is
that
there
was
a
big
demonstration
in
montgomery,
a
thousand
students
went
down
from
the
alabama
state
college,
the
negro
college
there,
went
down
to
the
capitol
steps
as
a
group.
and
massing
on
the
steps,
they
said
the
lord's
prayer
and
sang
the
star-spangled
banner
and
then
they
walked
back
to
the
campus.
this
was
a
protest
against
the
earlier
denial
of
lunch
counter
service
in
the
courthouse
building
to
some
30
students
who
had
demanded
service.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
so
i
understand
mr.
justice.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
it
is
sir,
yes.
now,
after
this
had
happened,
nine
of
the
student
leaders
of
this
lunch
counter
demonstration
were
in
fact
expelled
from
college.
they
were
expelled
by
the
state
board
of
education
of
which
the
governor
was
ex
officio
chairman
and
at
which
he
appointed
the
members.
i
believe
the
minutes
of
that
meeting
showing
their
expulsion
also
appear
in
the
record,
they
were
proven
independently
by
another
witness
by
respondent.
and
of
course
when
the
expulsion
took
place,
there
was
a
student
strike
in
protest.
that
i
think
is
consistent
with
what
the
paragraph
says
but
the
statement
was
inaccurate
in
saying
as
it
did
that
the
students
refused
to
reregister.
they
didn't
refuse
to
reregister
or
at
least
only
an
infinitesimal
number
may
have.
and
they
--
more
than
that,
the
ad
was
wrong
in
stating
that
their
dining
hall
was
padlocked
in
an
attempt
to
starve
them
into
submission.
there's
no
evidence
that
the
dining
hall
was
padlocked.
the
evidence
says
that
it
was
not
padlocked
and
of
course,
there
was
no
attempt
to
starve
the
students
into
--
into
submission.
and
reverting
to
the
first
sentence
which
says
that
truckloads
of
police
armed
with
shotguns
and
teargas
ringed
the
campus,
the
evidence
doesn't
show
that
the
police
ever
ringed
the
campus
and
that
a
literal
sense,
it
shows
that
they
were
deployed
near
the
campus
in
large
numbers
on
three
occasions.
their
armament
is
not
shown
by
the
record
one
way
or
another
and
that
it
is
true
that
after
a
subsequent,
in
a
period
of
a
few
days,
there
was
another
demons
--
student
demonstration,
this
time
on
the
campus.
and
the
superintendent
of
grounds
called
the
police
and
they
came
in,
the
students
had
grown
rowdy
and
they
made
some
32
arrests.
the
arrested
students
subsequently
the
record
shows
pleaded
guilty
and
were
fined
in
varying
amounts
for
minor
crimes
like
disorderly
conduct.
now,
if
i
turn
to
the
sixth
paragraph,
the
southern
violators'
paragraph,
i
have
to
say
that
it
was
shown
by
the
evidence
to
be
a
lot
more
accurate.
dr.
king's
home
had
at
that
time
been
bombed
not
once
but
twice.
one
of
the
bombs
failed
to
go
off,
the
other
did
go
off,
he
and
his
wife
were
home
at
the
time.
he
claimed
at
least
to
have
been
assaulted
on
one
occasion
when
he
was
arrested,
though
the
arresting
officer
denied
that
there
had
been
a
physical
assault
and
there
was
a
controversy
in
the
record
about
that.
and
he
was
arrested
not
seven
times
to
be
sure
as
the
other
paragraph
says
but
it
was
established
that
he
was
arrested
four
times.
and
as
i
said
earlier,
he,
at
this
very
time,
was
charged
with
perjury
and
an
indictment
in
two
counts
that
did
indeed
carry
a
potential
sentence
of
10
years
if
he'd
been
convicted.
he
was
in
fact
subsequently
acquitted
of
that
charge.
now,
these
are
the
essential
facts
about
publication
that
the
courts
below
held
unprotected
by
the
first
amendment.
now,
i
come
now
to
the
theory,
i
--
i
shall
not
permit
myself
to
call
it
evidence
that
was
relied
on
to
sustain
a
verdict
that
these
statements
to
which
i've
called
attention
libeled
this
respondent.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
there
were
four
in
montgomery.
there
actually
was
another
one
outside
of
montgomery
mr.
justice
but
when
i
said
four,
i
meant
four
in
montgomery.
and
i'm
glad
you
asked
me
that
because
it
reminds
me
that
i
failed
to
call
attention
to
the
perfectly
obvious
fact
that
this
sixth
paragraph
doesn't
say
a
thing
about
montgomery.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
correct.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
he
was
arrested
four
times
in
montgomery
and
my
recollection
is
that
that
didn't
count
another
arrest
in
atlanta.
i
think
perhaps
it
was
on
the
perjury
charge
that
he'd
been
in
atlanta
and
was
arrested
there.
i
--
i'm
reasonably
confident
of
my
recollection
about
the
fifth.
it
would
be
easy
to
check.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
they
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
oh
in
--
it's
the
sixth,
yes.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
the
words
beginning
again
and
again
and
down
through
the
italicized
words
"10
years"
on
the
eighth
line.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
i
believe
it
is.
i
believe
it
is
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
--
mr.
justice.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
it
is
a
state
college.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
i
assume
so.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
i
know
that
it
is
a
state
college
under
the
state
board
of
education
where
they
--
where
the
governor
of
the
state,
the
ex
officio
chairman
of
the
board
of
trustees.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
i
--
i
would
have
to
answer
your
question
in
this
way
mr.
justice.
i
would
have
to
refer
to
what
the
respondent
argued
at
various
times
of
this
case.
the
pleading
did
not
separate
out
any
particular
statement.
and
under
the
alabama
practice,
no
innuendo
need
be
alleged
so
that
we
are
at
a
loss
and
it
gives
a
--
may
i
say,
a
very
unreal
quality
to
this
proceeding.
we
are
at
a
loss
to
know
precisely
in
what
respect
the
respondent
claims
that
he
was
libeled.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
the
--
no,
i
don't
concede
any
inaccuracy
but
i
--
i
say
that
the
record
shows
a
contrariety
of
evidence
on
the
question
whether
dr.
king
was
assaulted.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
and
those
are
the
only
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
exactly,
sir.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
well,
that's
a
problem
of
construction.
that
point
was
not
made
by
our
opponents,
they
made
almost
every
other
point
but
they
didn't
make
that
one.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
but
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
exactly.
but
i
think
in
order
to
understand
commissioner
sullivan's
position
fully
and
i
would
like
to
put
it
now
as
i
understand
it,
let
me
say
first
that
he's
been
a
commissioner,
elected
commissioner
of
the
city
of
montgomery
since
october
5th,
1959.
and
he
specifically,
the
commissioner
of
public
affairs
and
as
such,
his
jurisdiction
includes
the
supervision
of
a
number
of
departments,
police,
fire,
scales
and
cemeteries
being
the
four
are
in
--
as
the
record
indicates.
he
doesn't
supervise
the
police
force
daily
in
the
sense
as
the
police
chief
does
and
there
is
a
police
chief.
but
the
police
chief
reports
to
sullivan
and
he's
responsible
himself
or
to
sullivan.
so
it's
something
like
the
relationship
between
--
in
a
large
city
between
the
police
commissioner
and
the
mayor.
commissioner
is
in-charge
of
day-to-day
operations.
the
mayor
is
his
boss,
in-charge
of
the
whole
show.
now,
commissioner
sullivan
testified
and
what
he
said
was
quite
simply
that
he
felt
that
the
statements
in
the
advertisement
that
referred
to
events
in
montgomery
reflected
on
him,
on
the
other
commissioners
and
on
the
whole
community.
and
that
he
added
that
when
they
described
police
action
or
police
activities,
they
were
associated
particularly
with
himself
as
the
commissioner
who
had
jurisdiction
of
the
police
department.
and
this
really
is
the
basic
claim
of
the
respondent
in
the
case
on
which
he
won.
that
references
to
the
police,
brought
this
publication
home
to
him
because
he
was
the
commissioner
who
had
jurisdiction
over
the
police
and
the
witnesses
who
testified
for
him
are
the
people
in
montgomery,
some
of
them
friends
of
his,
testified
to
just
about
that.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
but
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
no
he
did
not
mr.
justice.
he
apparently
took
a
different
view
of
the
appropriate
response
to
this
type
of
publication.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
i
think
it
has,
sir.
now,
i
think
the
most
helpful
thing
that
i
could
do
next
is
to
emphasize
what
the
reference
is
to
the
police
in
the
police
of
activities
are.
and
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
there
are
only
two
allusions
to
police
in
the
--
in
the
parts
of
the
ad
that
are
involved
as
the
statement
in
the
first
paragraph
that
after
their
leaders
were
expelled
from
school,
truckloads
of
police,
armed,
ringed
the
campus,
armed
with
shotguns
and
teargas.
the
rest
of
that
paragraph
refers
to
state
authorities
when
they
put
--
entire
student
body
protested
to
state
authorities.
their
dining
hall
was
padlocked
and
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
it
could
be
the
state
police.
it
could
be
the
state
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
no,
these
were
the
montgomery
police
who
made
that
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
--
those
arrests.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
that
these
montgomery
police,
the
record
shows
were
deployed
nearby.
that
is
correct
sir.
now,
as
far
as
the
sixth
paragraph
is
concerned
--
oh,
i
--
i
do
want
to
say
this.
so
far
as
the
padlocking
statement
is
concerned,
i
submit
that
from
the
context
and
this
is
the
real
grievance
about
this
paragraph
incidentally,
the
padlocking,
i
submit
that
that
grievance
has
just
absolutely
nothing
to
do
whether
respondent
did
this.
if
anybody
has
a
grievance
about
it,
it's
the
state
authorities
that
are
--
they
referred
to
him
those
words
and
not
the
commissioner
of
the
city
of
montgomery
or
any
other
local
authorities
even
if
this
theory
of
reference
to
the
individual
could
be
accepted
which
i
deny.
and
the
sixth
paragraph
of
course
makes
no
allusion
to
montgomery
at
all
as
i
indicated
earlier
in
response
to
mr.
goldberg's
question.
and
the
only
reference
to
the
police
is
on
the
seven
arrests
which
was
wrong,
it
should've
been
fourth.
now,
we
urge
below
and
we
argue
here
that
such
a
reference
is
that
to
the
police
cannot
be
read
as
an
allusion
to
the
respondent
as
commissioner
in-charge
in
the
context
of
prosecution
of
an
action
for
libel.
but
even
if
it
could,
what
i
have
said,
i
think
makes
clear
that
any
evidential
basis
for
the
claim
of
falsity
must
rest
on
very
small
discrepancies
indeed
between
what
was
said
and
what
the
record
shows
to
have
been
the
case.
now,
at
this
point,
i
think
i
should
recognize
that
the
respondent
takes
a
wholly
different
view
what
this
case
is
about
and
i
wish
to
state
his
view.
he
says
that
the
claim
of
libel
was
at
the
--
this
publication
charged
commissioner
sullivan
with
padlocking
the
dining
hall,
with
bombing
dr.
king's
home,
with
assaulting
and
arresting
him,
with
charging
with
perjury
and
indeed
with
everything
that
happened
except
that
for
some
reason
that
i
don't
quite
understand,
he
makes
an
exception
for
the
expulsion
of
students.
he
acknowledges
that
that
was
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
board
of
education
and
he
doesn't
take
that
to
allude
to
himself.
when
it
came
to
the
testimony
about
this
reading
of
this
document,
which
i
submit
is
fantastic,
the
respondent
merely
said
that
he
considered
that
since
these
statements
appeared
in
paragraphs
that
contained
a
reference
to
the
police
that
they
all
referred
to
the
same
people
or
at
least
could
reasonably
be
taken
to
refer
to
the
same
people
and
that
he
did
take
them
to
all
refer
to
himself.
and
accepting
this
theory,
the
trial
court
permitted
him
solemnly
to
prove
that
he
hadn't
really
bombed
dr.
king's
home
and
that
the
police
in
fact
had
done
everything
they
could
to
solve
that
atrocious
crime.
had
worked
overtime
on
it
and
so
on
which
of
course
was
not
challenged
by
anybody
and
counsel
for
the
defense
called
in
this
position,
found
himself
saying,
"well,
we
don't
claim
that
this
was
true."
and
of
course,
they
didn't
claim
that
it
was
true
that
commissioner
sullivan
bombed
dr.
king's
home.
on
the
contrary,
what
we
claimed
and
claimed
throughout
the
trial
was
that
the
--
this
piece
of
paper
couldn't
be
read
to
make
the
charge
that
commissioner
sullivan
had
bombed
dr.
king's
home.
now,
i
don't
think
any
of
the
other
facts
in
the
record
add
significantly
to
the
case.
the
times
did
retract
the
--
these
two
paragraphs
formally
at
the
request
of
the
governor
of
alabama,
the
then
governor,
governor
patterson
who
claimed
to
have
been
libeled
and
the
times
published
their
retraction
saying
that
they
didn't
intend
to
imply
by
this
statement
any
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
governor.
in
explaining
why
they
did
this,
they
said
they
did
it
in
deference
to
the
high
office
that
he
held
as
--
as
governor
of
the
state.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
the
--
the
effect
of
it
mr.
justice
was
to
bar
punitive
damages
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
--
if
considered
adequate
under
the
alabama
retraction
statute.
governor
patterson
obviously
didn't
think
it
adequate
because
he
sued
$4
million
after
he
got
it.
but
that
would
be
an
issue
in
that
case
if
it
ever
went
to
trial
as
to
whether
he'd
be
entitled
to
any
punitive
damages.
now,
times
didn't
apologize
to
the
respondent
and
indeed
when
he
wrote
a
demand
for
a
retraction.
the
times'
counsel
replied
that
so
far
as
they
could
tell,
the
third
paragraph
of
the
ad
was
accurate
except
for
the
padlocking
statement
and
they
couldn't
see
how
that
or
anything
else
referred
to
commissioner
sullivan.
and
they
asked
to
let
him
know
if
he
would,
how
he
did
feel
that
it
referred
to
him
and
of
course
he
brought
suit
at
that
point
instead
of
undertaking
correspondence
and
that
didn't
surprise
the
times
which
knew
that
he
wanted
to
bring
a
suit.
the
only
other
thing
is
that
at
the
trial
itself,
harding
bancroft,
who
was
then
secretary
of
the
new
york
times,
repeated
what
in
substance
had
been
said
in
the
interrogatories
earlier
that
while
it
was
very
hard
to
say
what
the
new
york
times
thought
about
the
truth
of
these
statements
since
the
times
is
a
large
enterprise
composed
of
many
individuals
that
he
could
say
that
of
all
the
knowledge
that
the
times
had
was
embodied
in
these
reports
to
which
i
have
referred
and
that
is,
he
read
them.
he
considered
that
except
for
that
padlocking
statement,
the
material
was
generally
the
general
tenure
of
the
material
was
substantially
correct.
and
of
course,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
made
a
great
deal
of
this
testimony
of
mr.
bancroft
on
the
appeal
and
viewed
it
as
the,
i
should
say
the
prime
basis
for
sustaining
the
punitive
award.
now,
i
come
to
the
rulings
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes,
indeed.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
one
day.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes,
this
march,
29th?
mr.
herbert
wechsler
394
copies
went
to
alabama
of
which
some
350
went
to
mail
subscribers
in
alabama
being
mailed
--
put
into
the
united
states
mails
in
new
york
and
the
balance
went
by
carrier,
by
rail
carrier
and
perhaps
a
few
even
airmailed,
air
carrier
i
mean,
to
newsstands,
news
dealers
in
alabama
who
simply
sell
them.
so
that
i
suppose
you
get
to
new
york
times
in
a
few
newsstands
in
alabama
the
way
you
can
get
the
montgomery
advertiser
at
the
time
square
in
new
york
city
if
you
look
for
it.
now,
the
courts
below
denied
our
contention
that
this
publication
was
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
all
they
said
about
it
was
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
protect
libelous
statements.
then
on
the
libel
part
of
the
case,
they
ruled
that
these
paragraphs
in
suit
where
libelous
per
se
testing
that
by
the
general
test
that
whether
they
tended
to
injure
reputation.
and
that
was
a
ruling
made
by
the
court.
no
jury
ever
passed
on
whether
these
statements
were
libelous.
but
the
trial
court
did
submit
to
the
jury
the
question
whether
these
statements
which
the
jury
was
told,
were
libelous
per
se
were
made
of
and
concerning
commissioner
sullivan.
that
question
was
put
to
the
jury
and
as
to
the
rest
the
court
told
the
jury
that
when
a
statement
is
libelous
per
se,
falsity
and
malice
and
special
damage
--
falsity
of
malice
and
general
damages
are
presumed.
there
was
no
need
for
any
proof
of
damage
by
the
plaintiff,
actual
damage
by
the
plaintiff
whatsoever
and
that
punitive
damages
were
available.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
they
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
well,
i
can't
say
that
the
court
went
that
far
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
emphasis
was
placed
on
the
official
position
of
commissioner
sullivan.
the
--
the
alabama
supreme
court
made
its
view
quite
explicit.
it
encountered
the
question
on
the
issue
whether
--
either
as
a
matter
of
state
law
or
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
there
was
here
sufficient
evidence
connecting
this
publication
with
the
respondent.
so
that
even
on
conventional
grounds,
there
was
any
basis
for
a
verdict.
and
what
the
court
said
is
at
page
1157
of
the
record
and
the
substance
of
it
was
that
in
measuring
the
performance
or
deficiencies
of
groups
like
public
groups
like
police,
fire
department,
other
municipal
agents,
put
praise
or
criticism,
is
usually
attach
to
the
official
in
complete
control
of
the
body
that
this
is
common
knowledge
and
as
i
said,
has
its
origin
and
established
legal
patterns.
i
don't
know
what
those
legal
patterns
were.
but
in
any
event,
this
comes
very
close
if
it
does
not
actually
become
a
kind
of
presumption.
now,
if
you
talk
about
the
police,
you're
talking
about
the
commissioner.
though,
i
can't
say
that
the
new
york
police
tap
wires
for
example,
though
i
believe
they
do
without
giving
commissioner
murphy
in
--
an
action
against
may
since
it's
illegal
for
them
to
do
it
without
a
court
order
in
new
york
and
under
the
federal
law.
and
i've
got
to
prove,
i've
got
to
prove
truth
and
make
my
defense
by
proving
true.
if
this
doctrine
is
constitutional
libel
law
and
of
course
we
submit
that
it
is
not.
and
our
contention
that
the
verdict
and
the
judgment
including
of
course
the
separate
attack
on
the
enormous
award,
work
in
abridgement
of
the
freedom
of
the
press
were
all
rejected
below.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
it
is
mr.
justice,
yes.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
we
--
we
prayed
for
a
separation
which
was
denied,
argued
that
this
was
error
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
it's
not
adverted
to
in
the
opinion.
and
i
assume,
therefore,
that
there
is
no
requirement
of
state
law
that
there
be
such
a
separation.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
none
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
exactly
that
--
i
would
say
the
presumption
if
there's
a
real
presumption
was
rebutted
on
the
record
because
the
respondent's
own
witnesses
said
they
didn't
believe
it
of
him
and
they
didn't
think
any
less
of
him
and
he
was
asked
if
he
could
show
that
he'd
been
hurt
in
anyway
and
no
way
had
he
been
hurt.
and
the
record
is
absolutely
clear
on
that.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
i
have
it
in
my
mind
mr.
justice
that
the
jury
was
out
two
hours
and
i
believe
the
record
shows
it.
but
i
can't
be
sure
the
record
shows
it.
i'm
pretty
sure
it
was
two
hours
and
a
few
minutes.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
i
apologize,
a
little
over
two
hours.
now,
i
come
to
my
legal
submissions
and
we
have
on
the
libel
part
of
the
case
essentially
two,
perhaps
three
really.
our
first
proposition
is
that
this
action
was
judged
in
alabama
by
an
unconstitutional
rule
of
law,
a
rule
of
law
offensive
to
the
first
amendment,
and
offensive
on
its
face
to
the
first
amendment.
taking
that
rule,
where
it
amounts
to
as
to
a
public
official
is
entitled
to
recover
presumed
in
punitive
damages
subject
to
no
legal
limit
and
amount
for
the
publication
of
a
statement
critical
of
his
official
action
or
even
of
the
official
action
of
an
agency
under
his
general
supervision.
if
the
court
finds
that
the
statement
tends
to
injure
reputation,
which
the
court
did
find
here
and
the
jury
finds
that
the
statement
makes
a
reference
to
him,
and
the
only
defense
available
is
that
the
statement
is
true
in
all
its
factual
material
particulars.
there's
no
qualified
privilege
in
alabama
as
there
is
in
some
states
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
barr
and
matteo,
that
--
that
the
--
the
qualified
privilege
rule,
it
goes
beyond
allowing
truth
as
a
defense
doesn't
apply
in
alabama
and
indeed,
the
writers
say
it's
a
minority
rule.
so
in
that
--
in
that
sense,
i'd
grasp
that
metal
and
say
that
does
apply
to
this
kind
of
a
statement.
we
are
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
the
majority
rule
as
it
appears
in
the
black
letter
of
libel
law.
now
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
oh
certainly,
certainly
we
--
certainly
we
assume
that
but
i
shouldn't
suppose
that
controversial.
that
was
certainly
true
in
the
bridges
case,
it
was
the
contempt.
and
it
was
true
in
the
cantwell
case
as
to
breach
of
the
peace
and
i
should
think
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
i
should
think
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
it's
this
rule
as
applied
to
officials,
then
the
criticism
of
official
conduct
which
we
submit
is
what
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
i
was
not
--
i
will
not
say
exclusively
about,
but
was
primarily
about.
and
we
are
actually
making
here
in
relation
to
this
rule
of
law
the
same
argument
that
james
madison
made
and
that
thomas
jefferson
made
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
this
sedition
act
of
1798.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
well,
if
i
take
my
instruction
from
james
madison,
i
would
have
to
say
that
within
any
--
any
references
that
madison
made,
i
can
see
no
toying
with
limits
or
with
exclusions.
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
the
proposition
is
that
the
first
amendment
was
precisely
designed
to
do
a
way
with
seditious
libel.
and
seditious
libel
was
criticism
of
it
in
punishment
for
criticism
of
the
government
and
criticism
of
officials.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
exactly.
of
course,
or
any
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
certainly
not.
we're
talking
about
the
full
ambit
of
the
first
amendment.
now,
i
realized
the
weight
of
this
argument
at
this
time,
the
sedition
act
was
never
passed
on.
but
on
the
other
hand,
as
i
see
our
case,
we're
in
the
same
position
that
the
contempt
cases
were
in,
in
the
1940
when
the
scope
of
the
contempt
power
had
never
been
considered
by
this
court,
when
obscenity
was
here
and
that
issue
had
never
been
considered.
in
--
in
short,
this
is
a
field
of
constitutional
interpretation
which
is
35
years
old,
that
is
a
fact
of
life.
and
this
is
the
first
time
that
we
have
had
--
that
the
opportunity
has
arisen
to
make
this
submission
in
this
court.
but
i
believe
that
if
james
madison
were
alive
today,
so
far
as
anything
that
i
can
see,
in
anything
he
wrote
or
--
and
particularly
in
the
report
on
the
virginia
resolutions
that
the
submission
that
i
am
making
was
a
submission
he
would
make.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
certainly.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
certainly,
certainly.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
certainly.
many
of
the
--
of
course
in
the
historic
period
in
which
madison
was
writing
charges
of
bribery
were
common
and
it
was
this
type
of
press
freedom
that
he
saw
in
the
first
amendment.
now
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
no.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
oh,
i
think
it's
posed
because
the
--
the
constitutionality
of
the
rule
by
which
the
case
was
judged
when
challenged
as
this
was
challenged
is
surely
an
issue
but
there
are
different
points
that
can
be
made
and
as
--
does
bring
me
to
my
--
my
second
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
next
to
narrower
and
there
were
two.
and
the
first
is
--
i
--
i
would
like
to
emphasize
what
it
comes
to
mr.
justice.
the
issue
is
i
think
whether
a
state
may
constitutionally,
for
the
sake
of
protecting
individual
rep
--
i'm
sorry,
for
the
sake
of
protecting
official
reputation.
we're
not
dealing
with
individual
reputation
here.
we're
dealing
with
official
reputation.
it's
criticism
of
his
official
conduct
that's
involved,
not
private
and
not
his
private
life,
though
i
admit
that
that's
not
an
easy
line
to
draw
since
obviously,
private
affairs
do
bear
on
officials
--
on
official
competence
and
i'm
not
trying
to
oversimplify
this.
but
if
this
is
a
valid
rule
of
law,
the
proposition
must
be
that
it
is
constitutional
to
prefer
the
protection
of
official
reputation
against
that
diminution
which
arises
from
the
criticism
of
your
official
conduct
that
it's
constitutional
to
prefer
that
to
the
freedom
of
criticism
or
at
least
to
do
so
was
to
criticism
can
be
proved
to
be
false.
now,
that
pictures
everything
of
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
well,
i
don't
think
you
can
assume
it
was
false
here.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
you
could
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes.
but
the
record
shows
how
far
it
was
true
and
how
far
it
was
false
mr.
justice.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
the
jury
was
passed
on
it.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
well,
the
jury
actually
didn't
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
--
have
the
issue
of
falsity
submitted
to
it.
and
the
jury
was
told
that
it
was
presumably
false.
and
it
is
true
that
we
couldn't
plead
truth
and
the
reason
why
we
couldn't
plead
truth
was
that
we
couldn't
say
that
the
ad
said
that
commissioner
sullivan
bombed
martin
luther
king's
home.
the
--
we
didn't
think
the
ad
said
that,
so
the
case
had
to
be
litigated
in
the
trial
court
and
it
wasn't
litigated
under
the
happiest
circumstances
for
the
defendant
anyhow.
but
it
had
to
be
litigated
in
terms
of
--
of
whether
the
statements
made
an
actionable
reference
to
commissioner
sullivan.
now
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
it
is
a
complete
defense
in
alabama
but
there's
no
privilege
beyond
that.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
only
on
facts
truthfully
stated.
so,
under
the
alabama
law,
you
lose
your
privilege
of
comment
as
indeed
under
the
law
of
many
states.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
you
lose
your
privilege
of
comment
unless
your
facts
are
right.
and
this
of
course
is
the
rule
of
the
hallam
case
that
circuit
judge
taft
wrote
in
late
90s
in
which
pretty
well-determined
the
black
letter
law
in
this
point
in
the
restatements
and
the
books.
but
i
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
the
truth
is
a
complete
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
and
it
has
to
be
and
it
has
to
meet
the
charge.
it
must
be
as
broad
as
the
charge.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
at
--
and
--
but
beyond
that
and
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that
the
plaintiff
was
contending
that
the
statements
said
that
sullivan
had
bombed
king's
home.
now,
it
was
true
that
king's
home
was
bombed
but
it
was
not
true
that
sullivan
bombed
his
home
or
that
we
conceive
that
anybody
in
the
world
in
his
right
mind
could
read
this
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
--
to
say
that
sullivan
bombed
it,
that
was
the
difficulty.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
i
don't
know
mr.
justice.
the
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
we
don't
know
what
the
jury
thought
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
--
referred
to
sullivan.
the
jury
did
find
that
the
statements
referred
to
sullivan
but
does
that
mean
that
all
the
statements
referred
to
sullivan
or
only
some
of
the
statements.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
the
--
this
issue
was
not
clarified
by
the
charge.
the
charge
was,
you
must
consider
whether
the
statements
refer
to
commissioners,
you
must
be
satisfied
that
the
statements
referred
to
commissioner
sullivan
without
referring
to
weak
statements
or
whether
any
of
the
statements
would
be
enough.
and
i
think
that
leaves
this
in
the
position
where
there
was
--
we
have
basis
for
grievance.
really,
if
any
of
the
statements
are
not
enough.
i
think
it's
the
stromberg
case
but
the
other
issue
is
it's
so
much
broader.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
it
was
free
except
that
the
evidence
didn't
support
such
a
view.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
no.
no,
we
asked
for
a
directed
verdict
of
course
and
our
main
grievance
was
that
if
the
record
verdict
was
denied.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
that
is
the
broadest
statement
that
i
made
but
i
wish
in
my
remaining
time
to
indicate
what
the
--
what
the
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
--
lesser
submissions
are
because
there
are
many
that
i
think
must
produce
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
--
the
reversal
in
this
case.
and
i
make
that
submission
because
of
the
impact
on
mayor
madison's
report
and
other
historic
material
about
the
first
amendment
as
applied
to
official,
the
criticism
of
officials.
but
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
that's
right.
what
he'd
have
to,
would
be
to
make
a
speech
using
his
official
privilege
as
mayor
to
make
a
speech
answering
this
charge.
and
that
of
course
is
what
most
mayors
do
and
what
the
political
history
of
the
country
has
produced
as
i
should
say
using
the
words
in
the
different
sense,
common
sense
of
american
libel
law,
not
that
these
actions
are
brought
but
that
they're
not
brought.
and
indeed,
madison
himself
observed
that
if
the
law
of
libel
hasn't
been
wise
where
it
had
been
enforced,
we'd
never
have
had
a
republic.
then
it
has
been
the
point
throughout
the
history
of
law
that
these
provisions
are
not
enforced.
and
these
actions
are
not
brought,
it's
only
when
you
encounter
a
monolithic
situation
of
the
sort
that
we
encountered
in
montgomery
that
there's
any
profit
in
bringing
the
action.
but
my
further
points
are
these.
first,
that
even
if
--
even
if
i'm
wrong,
you
have
then
a
situation
here
where
law
should
surely
attempt
an
accommodation
of
conflicting
interest,
the
interest
in
protecting
official
reputation
and
the
interest
and
freedom
of
discussion,
but
there
is
no
accommodation
here.
the
qualified
privilege
rule
might,
is
one
way
to
work
out
an
accommodation.
judge
clark
in
the
old
sweeney
case
suggested
require
limiting
the
action
of
proof
of
damage.
in
massachusetts,
there's
no
punitive
damages
and
so
on.
there
are
all
sorts
of
a
--
of
--
of
accommodating
(inaudible)
that
are
possible
but
are
rejected
by
alabama
here.
and
then
thirdly,
on
this
point,
we
have
of
course
the
submission
and
we
think
there's
a
constitutional
submission
that
there
was
in
this
record
no
evidence
sufficient
to
support
a
finding
that
these
particular
statements
in
this
particular
advertisement
threatened
the
--
this
particular
respondent's
reputation
in
any
tangible
way.
and
since
that
is
the
finding
which
justifies
on
this
assumption,
the
suppression
of
a
constitutionally
protected
freedom,
we
submit
that
the
normal
scope
of
supreme
court
review
as
to
the
facts
on
this
obtains.
and
it's
fiske
against
kansas
or
--
or
one
of
the
sedition
cases
in
which
the
prosecution
failed
to
make
a
record
that
warrants
a
finding
of
the
jurisdictional
basis
for
infringing
the
federal
right.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes.
i
think
very
definitely
mr.
justice.
i'm
--
i
am
not
making
that
we
have
the
thompson
argument.
but
i
think
norris
and
alabama,
we
brought
cases
together
at
the
be
--
beginning
of
the
second
point
in
the
brief
make
perfectly
clear
that
this
court
bridges
in
california
as
the
perfect
illustration.
this
court
has
the
responsibility
and
the
duty
to
satisfy
itself
that
the
record
sustains
the
basis
on
which
the
constitutional
right
asserted
has
been
held
to
be
unsound,
untenable
discrimination,
coercion
in
a
--
in
a
confessions
case.
and
here
--
here,
that
fact
is
threat
of
injury
to
individual
reputation.
and
if
there
is
no
threat
of
injury
to
individual
reputation
on
the
facts,
then
does
it
not
follow
under
this
general
principle
of
the
scope
of
review
that
we
are
entitled
to
reversal.
i'm
not
saying
it
may
make
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
certainly
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
thought
mr.
justice
harlan
that
in
your
own
opinion
in
one
of
the
obscenity
cases
where
you
talked
about
individualized
judgment.
in
individual
cases,
you
are
making
precisely
this
point
in
what
seems
to
me
an
analogous
context.
now
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
the
size
of
the
award
is
part
of
our
argument
on
the
--
on
the
evidence
exactly
that
the
--
we
say
--
that
we
say,
there
was
no
evidence
for
a
finding
of
threat
or
injury
but
we
add
to
that
that
surely
there
wasn't
any
evidence
to
sustain
a
judgment
of
this
sort
which
is
a
death
penalty
for
any
newspaper
if
multiplied.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
the
jury
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
it's
a
part
of
the
argument
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
really
but
it
is
an
independent
one.
we
say
there
wasn't
any
evidence
here
for
any
--
any
award
but
certainly,
there
wasn't
any
evidence
for
$500,000
award.
and
it
is
$500,000
award
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
press
of
this
country
carries
the
hazard
of
course
that
this
case
entails.
now,
i
should
say
in
closing
that,
there's
a
separate
submission
on
the
jurisdictional
point,
i
--
i
must
submit
that
on
the
brief.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
the
exact
facts
mr.
justice
are
that
at
the
time
when
the
publication
was
made,
the
new
york
times
had
nothing,
by
way
of
information,
to
indicate
that
the
statements
were
false.
now,
i
know
that
that
is
inconsistent
with
what
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
says.
it
says
that
we
had
in
our
files,
dispatches,
stories
from
our
correspondents
that
would
show
that
the
statements
were
false
but
the
record
does
not
sustain
that
statement.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
but
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
but
you
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
you
have
to
accept
the
supreme
court's
--
of
alabama's
version
also
mr.
justice
on
the
other
concerning
point
in
order
to
get
to
the
broad
ground.
actually,
if
you
start
with
the
narrow
grounds
and
work
to
broad
ones
because
if
there
was
no
evidence
sufficient
to
relate
this
publication
to
sullivan,
i
submit
we
are
constitutionally
entitled
to
reversal,
even
if
we
knew
it
was
false
as
a
matter
of
history.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
in
this
case
or
in
this
statement,
i
most
vigorously
submit
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
they
could
not.
the
reason
--
well,
the
reason
why
they
could
not
because
the
record
shows
if
there
are
175
policemen,
that
there
was
a
police
chief
in
addition
to
the
commissioner.
and
there's
not
the
slightest
bit
of
a
suggestion
here
in
my
submission
that
what
the
police
did,
they
were
ordered
to
do
by
commissioner
sullivan
as
the
city
commissioner
with
jurisdiction
over
the
police.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
i
haven't
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
well,
it
isn't
charged
to
be
a
continuant
thing
in
montgomery,
alabama.
in
this
--
in
this
document,
there
are
two
statements
about
the
police
and
only
two
and
ringing
the
campus
was
practically
true.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
i
--
in
stating
the
case
mr.
justice,
i
accepted
for
purposes
of
argument,
commissioner
sullivan's
statement
that
when
you
talk
about
arrest,
you're
talking
about
police.
but
obviously,
it
is
not
explicitly
important
that
the
police
arrested
him.
i
--
i
assume
police
do
make
arrests
and
that's
alright.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
that's
paragraph
six.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
well,
there
are
citizens
to
arrest
certainly
but,
i
--
i
accept
the
proposition
that
that
sentence
can
reasonably
be
tagged
in
this
reference
to
police
action
if
they
had
arrested
them.
i
don't
accept
the
proposition
that
they
have
arrested
him,
that
--
that
they
--
and
they
have
arrested
him
as
the
same
as
that
they
may
bomb
his
home.
obviously,
this
was
a
recitation
of
all
the
grievances
that
this
man
has.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes,
in
montgomery.
of
course
the
ad
doesn't
say
that
they
were
made
in
montgomery
but
in
fact,
they
were
made
in
montgomery.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
well,
he
--
he
at
one
time
lived
in
montgomery
as
i
understand
it
but
he
left
and
moved
to
atlanta.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
at
the
time
of
this
publication,
he
lived
in
atlanta.
atlanta
was
his
home,
yes.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
at
the
time
of
the
four
arrests
that
the
evidence
showed,
i
believe
he
lived
in
montgomery.
it
could
be
that
one
of
those
was
accurately
left,
and
it
could
be
the
record
isn't
certain
about
that
sir.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
i
--
i
think
that's
a
question
of
whether
the
innuendo
is
proved.
and
the
first
you
have
to
do
in
deciding
whether
it's
proved
is
to
look
at
the
document
and
ask
yourself
whether
the
document
is
reasonably
susceptible
of
being
read
in
a
way
that
the
innuendo
charges.
i
believe
this
is
a
way
a
libel
case
would
normally
be
tried.
and
many
courts
would
rule
--
i
believe,
i
think
most
courts
would
rule
that
this
document
could
not
be
libelous
under
the
common
law
of
the
united
states
because
the
only
references
here
that
could
be
taken
to
refer
the
respondent
are
references
to
police
that
that's
two
larger
group
in
the
setting
of
this
--
of
this
evidence,
175
to
permit
the
statement
to
be
read
to
mean
either
all
policemen
or
to
mean
not
all
policemen
but
just
the
commissioner
in
charge.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
well
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
i
distinguish
beauharnais
on
the
ground
that
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
official
conduct
and
that
the
issue
with
respect
to
official
conduct
was
expressly
reserved
in
the
majority
opinion.
it
was
deemed
by
the
court
to
be
a
different
issue.
but
if
you
ask
me
beyond
that,
mr.
justice,
whether
i
think
beauharnais
was
--
should
be
followed
and
was
correctly
decided,
i
do
not.
but
i
do
believe
it's
a
different
case
than
this
and
it
does
involve
a
finding,
a
state
court
finding
of
danger
of
violence
which
is
an
important
public
end
and
which
is
not
involved
in
this
situation
at
all.
main
distinction,
i
say
is
that
was
not
official
conduct.
and
i
can't
believe
that
in
the
state
of
illinois
where
judge
floyd
thompson
wrote
that
great
opinion,
when
the
city
of
chicago
tried
to
sue
for
libel
and
got
thrown
out
on
the
ground
that
you
can't
libel
a
city.
i
can't
believe
he
had
turned
around
and
sustained
that
action
if
mayor
thompson
had
brought
the
action
instead
of
the
city.
and
that's
what
this
was,
that's
what
this
case
is.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
yes
sir.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
the
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
well,
no,
there
was
an
issue
made
but
it
didn't
work
that
way.
it's
requested
charge
18
which
is
in
the
record
and
the
--
that
the
essence
of
the
charge
was
--
of
the
requested
charge
was
that
the
jury
--
that
punitive
damages
could
not
be
returned.
i'm
summarizing
of
course,
could
be
returned
only
in
the
event
that
you,
a
jury
--
it's
at
page
844
of
the
record,
are
convinced
by
a
fair
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
defendant,
the
new
york
times
company,
in
publishing
the
matter
complained
of
was
motivated
by
personal
ill-well.
that
is
actual
intent
to
do
the
plaintiff
harm
or
that
the
defendant
was
guilty
of
gross
negligence
and
recklessness
and
not
just
of
ordinary
negligence
or
carelessness
in
publishing
the
matter
complained
of
so
as
to
indicate
a
wanton
disregard
of
plaintiff's
rights.
now,
that's
i
think
is
close
as
we
come
to
it
mr.
justice
white.
that
request
was
made
and
denied
and
no
--
there's
no
equivalent
of
that
instruction
in
the
charge
that
was
actually
given.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
no,
just
--
well,
yes,
punitive
damages
are
given
to
deter
the
offender
and
to
deter
others
but
no
indication
of
the
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
exactly.
no
--
no
indication
that
the
jury
had
to
find
malice
in
fact
as
libel
are
--
is
thought
of
malice
in
order
to
justify
punitive
award.
that
is
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
that
is
not
in
the
charge.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
well
--
mr.
herbert
wechsler
there
was
in
the
testimony
of
course.
the
testimony
of
mr.
bancroft
was
the
story
from
the
times'
point
of
view.
when
it
came
to
the
requests,
i
think
this
is
where
it
came
up.
our
great
exception
was
to
the
ruling
that
it
was
libelous
per
se
and
secondly,
to
the
proposition
that
there
was
evidence
that
it
was
often
concerning
sullivan.
now,
the
(inaudible)
--
that
was
the
main
contour
of
the
trial.
mr.
herbert
wechsler
no,
we
have
not
made
that
point,
mr.
justice.
