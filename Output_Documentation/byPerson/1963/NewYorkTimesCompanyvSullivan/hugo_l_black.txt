suppose
that
the
jury
found
that
he
did?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

it
was
not
deliberate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
as
i
--
as
i
understood
you
had
something
to
say
about
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
jury
has
passed
on
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
held
it
was
false.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
the
finding?
(inaudible)
and
was
there
--
it
was
in
evidence,
(inaudible)
the
evidence,
sullivan
was
a
police
commissioner,
in-charge
of
the
police,
responsible
for
their
actions,
is
enough
to
justify
the
jury
in
finding
that
the
charge
that
the
police
acted
terribly,
terribly
bad
manner
as
to
indicate
injury.
the
jury
was
--
couldn't
find
that
that
was
a
charge
against
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
the
jury
have
a
right
to
adjourn,
they
have
a
right
to
determine
that
if
the
police
of
the
city
who
were
armed
with
shotguns,
teargas
bombs,
go
around
and
throw
that
--
wait
around
with
all
that
that
it
shown
that
the
chief
of
police,
the
man
--
actually
the
chief
of
police
was
the
commissioner,
wouldn't
that
be
enough
for
a
judge
or
jury
reasonably
define
that
the
head
of
the
department
was
responsible
in
part
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
particularly,
if
it's
charged
to
be
a
continuant
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
according
to
jury
were
to
find
--
to
have
treated
these
paragraphs
separately?
suppose
that
the
document
as
a
whole
showed
that
it
was
a
charge
intended
to
be
the
charge
either
by
innuendo,
insinuation
or
direct
to
the
first
statement
that
the
police
department
has
joined
with
a
bunch
of
(inaudible)
to
do
the
--
permit
the
--
what
i
was
called
offenses
that
are
charged
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
say
that
it's
the
same
that
if
--
if
it
by
insinuation,
in
innuendo,
it
would
not
be
equally
chargeable
if
you
are
wrong
on
your
first
big,
broad
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
he
was
one
in
the
group,
that
there
were
a
175
or
200?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
accept
beauharnais?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
the
plaintiff
has
had
asked
for
a
charge
if
we,
the
jury
find
all
the
issues
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
normally
the
fact
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
normally
the
practice
so
that
the
plaintiff
did
not
want
to
take
a
risk
on
a
general
verdict
referenced
to
some
of
the
issues.
he
could
ask
the
court,
(inaudible)
the
jury.
we,
the
jury,
find
all
of
the
issues
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
and
under
those
circumstances,
it
would've
foreclosed
all
issues
but
a
general
verdict
might
not,
was
that
--
was
that
proved
and
abandoned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
formerly
or
effective,
i
know
in
dispute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
can
be,
given
the
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
record,
mr.
rogers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
you
just
stated?
justice

black
in
connection
with
this
matter.
justice

if
you
just
going
to
(inaudible)
refer
us
to

(inaudible)
in

justice

one
of
the

another

case?
justice

black
one
that
--
justice

black
(inaudible)
justice

is
it
printed
in

justice

it's
printed
in
court
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
it
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
lawsuits?
justice

l.
black
how
many
judgments?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
with
half
a
million
dollar
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
like
that
in
this
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
could
agree
with
you,
that
action
was
in
this
case
(inaudible)
in
another
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
you
were
now
talking
about
the
statements
he
made
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
as
i
understand
it
what
you'd
do
with
this
whole
(inaudible)
the
court
was
in
error
in
not
passing
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
it
has
to
go
back
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
in
the
merits
just
to
decide
on
the
--
let
them
act
again
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
--
i
said
that
because
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
a
great
deal
of
your
time
on
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
particular
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
point
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
can
understand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
understand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
decisive
in
point
that
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
continuances
--
that
they
must
be
kept
alive?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
to
that
effect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
discretionary
matter,
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
judge
can't
waived
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
all
cases?
did
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
tell
that
in
all
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
nachman,
i'm
very
much
interested
in
the
basic
question
argued
by
(inaudible)
as
to
evidence
in
connection
with
--
whether
they
were
responsible
for
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
it
divides
the
(inaudible)
into
two
parts.
one,
was
there
evidence
upon
which
the
jury
could
find
that
they
actually
did
this?
second,
even
if
there
was
no
such
evidence,
was
there
--
it
cannot
be
said
that
they
acquiesced
it
and
--
so
as
to
make
them
liable?
i'd
like
to
just
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
it's
alright
with
you
to
mention
that
and
say,
"first,
was
there
and
--
and
is
it
your
position
that
there
was
a
--
from
which
the
jury
could
find,
they
were
responsible
for
it
initially
and
if
so,
what
is
that
evidence
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
those
--
there
are
only
two.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
he
one
of
the
defendants?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
even
so,
you
rely
on
that
as
substantive
proof,
they
authorized
their
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
mean,
before
you
get
to
the
so-called
ratification,
is
that
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
examine
--
take
depositions
of
randolph
or
summoned
as
a
witness?
justice
hugo
l.
black
during
the
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
come
to
alabama
rule
that
wouldn't
make
a
hearsay
statement
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this,
you
have
no
testimony
from
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
then
refused
as
evidence
to
prove
that
these
people
had
done
what
randolph
said
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
state
that
was
the
purpose
for
which
he
was
interviewed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
the
time
it
was
interviewed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
new
york
times
in
that
case
gave
you
a
statement
by
a
third
person
who
was
not
a
party
to
the
lawsuit,
and
not
a
witness.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
but
they
were
different
defendants.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it's
--
some
evidence
could
be
admissible
against
some
and
not
against
others.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you've
got
to
decide
or
restrict
hearsay
evidence
when
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that
person
(inaudible)
against
the
new
york
times,
they're
the
ones
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
no.
if
you
state
that
it
was
offered
against
the
other
people
who
had
not
given
you
the
answer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
the
third
prong,
that's
the
third
prong
that
you're
proving
against
them.
if
that's
eliminated,
what
do
you
have
left?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
assume
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
the
fact
that
a
man's
name
appeared
on
an
ad
was
enough
to
hold
him
libel
for
half
a
million
dollars.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
you
wouldn't
--
you
said
they
wouldn't
say
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
other
side,
did
they
deny
they've
given
authority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
of
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
you
have
these
items
that
you've
mentioned,
besides
from
your
ratification,
have
these
items
that
you've
mentioned,
which
includes
the
letter
from
randolph?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
what
has
been
paid
to
other
people
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
in
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
didn't
they
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
holding
in
libel
for
libel
(inaudible).
you
mean
that's
not
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
the
first
amendment
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
main
argument
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
him
to
say
there
was
a
conflict
that
these
two
witnesses
testified
as
you've
said.i
--
i
may
have
been
wrong
but
if
someone
else
has
testified,
that
a
times'
man
had
testified
about
a
second
list,
that
should've
been
a
part
of
it.
i
thought
he
said
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
say
something
about
a
second
list
or
--
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
his
name
is
redding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
alright.
