mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
thank
you.
if
it
pleases
the
court.
i
should
like
to
address
my
remarks
to
the
question
of
fair
trial
and
if
time
permits
to
discuss
briefly
the
question
of
fair
comment
and
to
close
by
summarizing
the
position
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
a
present
litigation
is
but
one
of
several
libel
suits
instituted
by
a
number
of
state
and
local
officials
in
alabama
on
the
basis
of
an
advertisement
which
appeared
in
the
new
york
times
on
march
29th,
1960.
the
sole
purpose
of
this
litigation
is
to
suppress
and
punish
expressions
of
support
for
the
course
of
racial
equality
and
to
try
to
keep
those
who
are
actively
engaged
in
their
fight
for
civil
rights,
such
as
the
petitioners
in
this
case
from
continuing
to
participate
in
that
stroke.
it
is
the
petitioners'
contention
that
the
injustice
of
this
action
which
encroaches
on
freedom
of
speech
under
the
guise
of
punishing
for
libel
is
magnified
by
the
fact
that
the
petitioners
fail
to
receive
a
fair
trial.
this
trial
was
conducted
in
an
atmosphere
of
racial
bias,
passion
and
hostile
community
pressures.
the
atmosphere
under
which
this
trial
was
conducted
is
quickly
sensed
by
bruising
the
record.
one
has
only
to
thumb
through
this
record
to
find
a
number
of
interesting
things.
one,
you'll
find
that
the
record
makes
reference
to
mr.
m.r.
nachman,
jr.
to
mr.
embry,
but
when
to
get
to
the
lawyers
for
the
petitioners
who
happened
to
be
negroes,
they
are
referred
to
as
lawyer
gray
and
lawyer
crawford.
i
think
it's
a
shame
in
this
day
in
time
for
a
record
to
come
up
to
this
great
court
where
so
many
pronouncements
of
equality
and
freedom
have
been
made
particularly
in
recent
years,
had
to
have
a
record
of
this
kind
before
it.
to
be
sure
it
is
done
by
the
stenographer,
but
the
stenographer
i
think
generally
speaking
reflects
the
attitude
and
the
demeanor
of
the
court
and
the
customs
and
the
usages
of
what
goes
on
in
a
place
where
the
court
is
located.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
is
the
record
approved?
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
yes.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
he
--
he
does.
in
fact,
i
will
go
into
--
right
now,
sir
on
page
570
of
the
printed
record.
the
lawyers
for
the
plaintiff
and
the
times
were
introduced
to
the
jury
panel
as
a
mister,
but
those
for
the
petitioners
were
introduced
as
fred
gray,
solomon
seay,
v.
e.
--
v.
z.
crawford.
i
want
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
that
--
that's
the
judge,
judge
jones.
and
on
one
occasion,
one
of
the
plaintiff
--
one
of
the
counsels
for
the
plaintiffs
mispronounced
the
word
negro
as
niger
and
went
in
a
subsequent
colloquy
with
the
judge,
he
said
that's
the
way
he'd
been
pronouncing
it
all
of
his
life.
now,
also
in
final
argument
to
the
jury,
plaintiff's
counsel
made
a
highly
prejudicial,
i
think,
race-baiting
remarks
to
the
jury
which
should
have
been
censored
by
the
trial
court.
and
i
quote,
"in
other
words,
all
of
these
things
that
happened
did
not
happen
in
russia
where
the
police
ran
everything.
they
did
not
happen
in
the
congo
where
they
are
still
--
where
they
still
eat
them,
they
happened
in
montgomery,
alabama,
a
law
abiding
community".
now,
i
think
when
the
court
thinks
that
this
remark
was
made
about
the
time
when
there
was
a
great
deal
of
civil
strife
in
the
congo
and
there
was
a
great
deal
of
public
statements
made
in
newspaper
articles
printed
about
that
civil
strife
and
about
how
the
congolese
mistreated
whites,
raped
and
so
forth.
the
intensity
of
that
remark
can
be
felt
here.
now,
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
there
can
be
equal
protection
under
the
laws
and
due
process
in
a
court
where
there's
not
even
equality
of
courtesy
or
recognition
of
human
dignity.
now,
i'd
like
to
talk
for
just
a
few
minutes
about
the
presiding
judge
of
that
trial,
judge
walter
b.
jones.
now,
judge
jones
in
a
companion
case,
as
i
said
before
this
--
there
are
--
this
case
is
but
one
of
several
pieces
of
litigation
arising
out
of
the
same
set
of
facts.
and
james
b.
abernathy,
judge
jones
made
a
statement
on
open
court
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
a
pariah,
an
outcast
that
the
case
would
be
tried
in
accordance
with
white
men's
justice,
not
in
accordance
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
exact
words
of
judge
jones
were
very
interesting.
he
said,
"i
would
like
to
say
for
those
here
present
and
for
those
who
may
come
here
to
litigate
in
the
future
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
no
standing
whatever
in
this
court,
it
is
a
par
"
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
this
is
--
is
not
in
the
record
sir,
this
is
in
a
companion
case
and
this
was
actually
yesterday.
i
noticed
that
counsel
went
in
to
this
companion
cases,
this
is
just
another
one,
it's
the
parks
case
which
is
a
companion
case
is
in
the
record,
this
is
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
--
just
another
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
this
is
another
libel
case.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
it's
the
same
nature.
in
fact,
they
have
the
same
defendants.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
the
same
advertisement,
it's
exactly
the
same
case.
and
this
is
the
same
judge
who
tried
it.
and
i
think
that
where
the
words
are
the
judge's
own
where
he
has
actually
stated
them
in
an
open
court
that
they
should
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
--
of
this
court.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
i'm
reading
from
his
--
his
statement
that
he
made
from
the
bench
on
february
1,
1961
in
the
circuit
court
of
montgomery,
alabama.
his
remarks
are
printed
in
full
in
the
alabama
lawyer
and
its
entitled
"judge
jones
on
courtroom
segregation".
and
these
are
his
remarks
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
the
alabama
lawyer
pages
190
through
192
and
the
month
of
the
issue,
i
don't
have
it,
what's
the
month
of
the
issue?
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
volume
22?
volume
22.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
no,
it's
not
a
lower
--
well,
it
--
it
does
contain
law
review
type
articles
but
this
is
just
--
this
--
it's
a
--
it's
an
official
journal
as
they
say
of
the
alabama
bar.
it
contains
articles,
legal
law
articles
but
this
just
happens
to
be
his
statement
that
he
made
in
open
court,
it's
reprinted
in
the
alabama
lawyer.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
what's
that
sir?
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
it's
printed
in
the
court
record
in
this
case,
yes
sir.
in
the
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
in
the
--
no,
in
the
case
of
james
versus
abernathy,
it's
in
the
court
record.
he
made
the
statement
in
open
court.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
right
now
that
case
is
pending
in
this
--
i
believe
in
the
circuit
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
their
waiting,
if
i
understand,
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
it's
a
sort
of
waiting
the
outcome,
i
imagine,
of
this
case.
there
are
a
number
of
cases,
they're
about
four
or
five
of
them
down
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
--
in
alabama.
what's
that?
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
no,
no.
it
was
not
tried
first.
the
sullivan
case
was
tried
before
it.
this
statement
was
made
after
the
trial
of
the
sullivan
case.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
james
is
another
official,
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
he's
a
--
he's
a
commissioner,
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
half
--
half
a
million
dollar
judgment
yes.
now
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
what's
that
sir?
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
five
suits,
i
understand
it
pending
at
the
present
time.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
all
with
--
all
except
i
think
the
one
involving
them
--
the
--
the
governor,
i
think
is
for
$1
million.
the
others
are
for
$500,000.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
yes.
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
--
he
said
much
--
much
has
been
said
at
the
bar
and
out
of
the
hearing
of
the
trial
jury
as
to
the
supposed
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
directing
the
trial
judge
of
the
court
of
the
sovereign
state
how
to
conduct
a
trial
before
a
jury
in
the
courts
of
alabama."
i
would
like
to
say
for
those
present
and
for
those
who
may
come
here
to
litigate
in
the
future,
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
no
standing
whatever
in
this
court.
it
is
a
pariah
and
an
outcast."
and
it
goes
on
and
says,
"a
number
of
other
things
he
ends
up
with,
we
will
now
continue
the
trial
of
this
case
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
alabama
and
not
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
in
the
belief
and
knowledge
that
the
white
men's
justice.
a
justice
born
long
centuries
in
england,
brought
over
to
this
country
by
the
anglo-saxon
race
and
brought
today
to
it's
full
flower
here,
a
justice
which
has
blessed
countless
generations
of
whites
and
blacks
will
give
the
parties
of
the
bar
of
this
court
regardless
of
race
or
color
equal
justice
under
law."
these
are
some
of
the
quotes,
there
are
many
others
but
this
article
run
--
i
mean,
not
article
but
these
words
were
uttered
by
judge
jones,
take
about
three
pages.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
that
was
the
occasion
sir.
what
happened
here
was,
a
lot
of
negro
spectators
came
to
the
courtroom
one
day
and
they
filled
up
the
courtroom.
and
judge
jones
said
he
realized
what
they
were
doing
in
trying
to
end
the
segregation
in
the
courtroom
and
he
was
not
going
to
stand
for
it.
he
said,
"the
presence
of
this
crowd
of
negro
spectators,
occupying
every
seat
from
the
front
row
to
the
back
row
of
the
courtroom
is
--
is
to
test
and
challenge
the
right
and
power
of
the
presiding
judge
to
direct
the
seating
of
spectators
in
the
courtroom.
and
here,
under
the
constitutional
laws
of
alabama,
he
exercises
in
the
case
on
trial
a
solemn
judicial
power
of
the
state."
he
goes
on
to
say,
"from
this
hour
forward,
in
keeping
with
the
common
law
of
alabama
and
observing
the
wise
and
time
honored
customs
and
usages
of
our
people.
spectators
will
--
i'll
leave
something
up
but
it
ends
up,
spectators
will
be
seated
in
this
courtroom
according
to
their
race
and
this
for
the
orderly
administration
of
justice
and
the
good
of
all
people
coming
here
lawfully."
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
in
the
--
in
--
in
this
particular
record,
there
are
objections
made
--
constitutional
objections
have
been
raised
about
a
segregated
courtroom,
yes
sir.
but
the
judge,
who
is
judge
jones,
decided
that
the
motions
under
which
the
objections
were
made
had
lapsed
and
i
want
to
get
into
that
a
little
while
and
because
i
think
his
action
there
was
strictly
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
discriminatory.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
well,
what
--
what
happened
here
was
this,
just
as
well
take
this
now.
let
me
go
back
a
little
bit
and
say
that
the
--
the
respondent
here
contends
that
the
constitutional
objections
that
i've
been
discussing
are
not
properly
before
this
court
because
they
were
not
raised
in
a
timely
fashion.
but
if
the
court
will
examine
the
amended
demurrers,
they
will
see
that
even
at
that
early
stage
of
the
trial,
there
was
a
--
an
objection
to
any
recovery
because
it
was
claimed
by
the
petitioners
that
it
would
be
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
it
would
deprive
the
petitioners
of
their
property
without
due
process
of
law,
would
deny
them
equal
protection
of
justice
and
would
abridge
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
the
petitions.
they
then
make
--
they
then
again
made
constitutional
objections
and
motions
to
exclude
evidence
and
then
finally,
after
the
trial,
they
made
motions
for
new
trials
and
these
--
that
in
here,
they
made
very
extensive
objections,
constitutional
objections.
now,
the
--
the
respondent
claims
that
--
that
these
objections
shouldn't
count
and
should
not
be
before
this
court
because
they
involved
lapsed
motions.
now,
we
believe
that
the
--
the
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
well
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
well,
i'm
gonna
--
i
--
i
--
i
--
i
will
--
here's
what
happened.
after
these
motions
for
a
new
trial
were
made
and
they
were
made
timely
within
the
30
day
period,
the
petitioners
appeared
in
court
on
december
16th
and
all
the
parties
to
the
lawsuit,
at
least
the
times
and
the
petitioners,
they
wanted
to
get
a
long
adjournment.
under
the
alabama
law,
you
can
only
adjourn
a
motion
for
new
trial
for
30
days
at
the
time.
so
these
petitioners
or
attorneys
for
the
petitioners,
they
said,
well
(inaudible)
--
they
thought
that
as
the
new
york
times
was
going
to
come
in
and
adjourn
the
motion
until
it
was
heard,
they
would
not
have
to
appear
in
court.
and
they
did
not
appear
in
court
until
it
was
time
to
argue
and
that
was
march
3rd,
1961.
and
when
they
walked
into
the
court
on
march
3rd
to
argue
this
case,
the
judge
refused
to
hear
argument.
he
said
that
the
motions
had
lapsed,
that
--
that
they
did
not
appear
at
the
time
they
were
adjourned
and
therefore
they
had
lapsed.
now,
there
are
no
cases
in
alabama
precisely
on
point.
the
respondent
cites
none
and
we
were
unable
to
find
any
in
our
search
of
the
alabama
cases.
the
respondent
does
cite
cases
on
lapsed
motions
but
this
involved
an
individual
plaintiff
or
defendant
who
was
allowed
a
motion
to
lapse.
they
did
not
involve
as
here
two
or
more
plaintiffs
or
defendants
who
had
each
made
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
one
had
appeared
to
adjourn
the
hearing
of
the
motion
and
the
other
had
not
and
the
court
then
decided
on
the
day
of
the
argument
that
the
party
who
had
failed
to
appear
on
a
date,
the
matter
was
adjourned
could
not
argue
because
he
allowed
it
to
lapse,
announced
precisely
on
that.
i'd
--
i
would
go
further
here
your
honors
and
say
that
state
judges
have
an
obligation
to
protect
fundamental
constitutional
rights
of
individuals.
as
this
--
as
this
court
had
said
as
far
back
is
gibson
versus
mississippi
in
1895,
"upon
the
state
courts
equally
with
courts
of
the
union
rest,
the
obligation
to
god,
enforce
and
protect
every
right
guaranteed
or
secured
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states."
more
recently,
in
johnson
versus
virginia,
this
court
stated
that
the
state
has
a
duty
to
deny
no
one
equal
protection.
i
think
that
the
action
of
the
judge
here
was
arbitrary,
whimsical
and
capricious.
and
for
that
reason
alone,
can
be
set
aside
and
the
objections
that
are
raised
can
be
looked
at
by
this
court.
moreover,
this
court
has
held
that
alleged
violations
of
fundamental
constitutional
rights
when
plainly
and
reasonably
made,
are
not
to
be
defeated
under
the
name
local
practice
and
such
violations
are
reviewable
by
this
court
even
if
they
were
not
raised
strictly
in
accordance
with
local
forms
of
practice
and
procedure
and
--
procedural
technicalities.
therefore
for
all
of
those
reasons
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
it's
in
this
case
sir.
this
is
in
this
case.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
sir.
in
this
case,
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
well,
actually,
what
he
said
was,
he
--
he
endorsed
the
papers
only
that
the
--
that
the
--
that
the
motion
had
lapsed.
actually,
all
he
said
to
him
when
they
asked
to
be
heard,
he
just
said
you're
dead,
you're
dead
and
that's
all.
he
wouldn't
even
listen
to
them.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
i
don't
know
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
it
is
--
i've
understand
it's
a
--
it's
--
it's
at
least,
i
think
dated
at
the
same
time.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
they
--
they
did.
they
kept
--
they
went
in
and
got
adjournments
but
i
--
but
i
--
i
submit
to
--
to
the
court
that
i
think
you
will
realize
that
as
a
matter
of
just
general
practice
in
law
when
you
have
cases
involving
several
defendants
or
several
plaintiffs,
it's
often
a
practice
for
one
of
the
attorneys,
but
one
of
the
plaintiffs
or
the
attorney
--
or
defendants
to
go
down
to
the
court
and
get
an
adjournment
for
time
with
the
understanding
when
that
--
whenever
the
case
is
argued,
the
other
attorneys
will
be
present.
this
is
just
a
matter
of
common
sense
in
saving
time,
that's
all
that
these
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
--
lawyers
were
doing.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
yes,
this
--
this
one
case.
this
was
a
--
this
was
a
--
so
like
a
joint
action.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
the
--
the
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
no,
no.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
no,
no.
i
should
like
in
just
my
remaining
time
to
--
to
briefly
summarize
our
--
our
position
in
this
case.
it
--
it
is
our
position
here
that
there
was
absolutely
no
cause
or
connection
between
the
petitioners
and
the
alleged
libelous
statement.
there
is
no
evidence
to
show
that
the
petitioners
authorized
published
or
ratified
this
statement
in
question.
consequently,
the
recovery
against
the
petitioners
is
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
it
amounts
to
a
denial
of
due
process.
moreover,
we
submit
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
entire
advertisement
involved
in
this
case
discloses
simply
an
attempt
to
speak
on
a
crucial
public
issue.
it
is
not
an
attack
upon
any
specific
individual
therefore
it's
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
we
further
submit
that
even
if
this
can
properly
be
--
properly
be
characterized
as
a
libel
case,
the
utterances
here
made
as
they
were
in
good
faith
and
without
proof
of
any
special
damages
are
constitutionally
protected
since
they
relate
even
on
the
respondents'
theory
solely
to
criticism
of
his
conduct
as
a
--
an
elected
official.
this
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
right.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
correct.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
at
the
same
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
--
trial,
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
a
single
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
single
verdict.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
no,
it's
a
joint.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
its
not
--
i
think
its
$500,000
against
all
defendants.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
no,
one
$500,000.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
against
all.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
they've
adjourned
it
a
couple
of
times,
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
but
they
both
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
but
they
both
did
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
they
both
did
asked
for
new
trials
and
they
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
and
--
and
the
motions
for
a
new
trial
were
timely
filed.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
understand
that
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
originally,
they
came
and
they'd
filed
and
they
appeared
at
the
--
at
the
time
they
were
required.
the
only
time
they
did
not
appear,
for
--
was
for
the
simple
adjournments.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
it's
rather
nonsensical
after
a
run
down
of
the
court,
have
a
lot
of
lawyers
come
down
to
court
just
to
simply
get
a
clerk
or
the
judge
to
say
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
--
"i'll
give
you
another
30
days."
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
well,
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
--
i
--
i
do
not
think
that
that
is
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
to
be
perfectly
honest
with
you,
the
alabama
practice
--
i
think
that
when
we
bruise
this
--
when
you
bruise
the
--
or
i
shouldn't
say
bruise,
when
you
go
back
and
study
the
practice
as
you
often
have
done
in
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
--such
cases
--
i
think
you'd
find
that
this
is
not
necessarily
the
practice.
and
we
couldn't
find
the
case
and
then
--
and
the
cases
the
cite
it
are
not
really
on
point
where
they
have
these
joint
kind
of
cases
where
one,
just
one
defendant
after
having
made
the
motion
timely
is
said
to
have
allowed
it
to
lapse
merely
because
he
does
not
appear
at
the
date
the
cases
just
put
over
for
a
hearing.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
exactly.
exactly
sir.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
as
we
could
not
find
any
and
they
do
not
cite
it
here
that's
my
statement.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
no,
there's
no
record
of
that.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
that.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
no,
no.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so.
no
sir.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
well
actually
sir
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
well
actually
sir,
we
--
we
think
that
this
case
should
be
decided
on
other
grounds
so
it
be
totally
reversed
and
not
sent
back
for
a
new
trial.
i
bring
this
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
yes.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
yes.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
well
i
--
i
did
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
i
hadn't
--
i
hadn't
planned
to
spend
as
much
time
as
i
did
but
it
seems
--
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
--
to
be
an
interesting
subject
to
the
justices
of
the
supreme
court.
mr.
samuel
r.
pierce,
jr.
thank
you
very
much.
i
think
i
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
