mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
the
defendant,
no.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
i
gave
too
short
of
an
answer.
the
government's
position
is
that
if
appeal
is
taken
then
it
defendant
does
have
a
right
to
go,
(inaudible)
on
bail.
if
no
appeal
is
taken
then
there
is
no
right
to
bail.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that's
what
i
assume
the
question
to
be.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
right
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that's
our
position.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
unfortunately
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
don't
think
the
study
which
is
quite
intensive
involves
not
only
interviews
with
the
prisoner,
but
observation
of
the
prisoner
over
this
extended
period
and
most
often
it's
not
three
months,
it's
six
months,
it
is
extended,
does
require
the
physical
presence
of
the
defendant
at
the
jail
and
we
must
remember
that
penitentiary
is
not
necessarily
proximate
to
the
place
of
sentencing
it.
it
maybe
some
far
distance
away.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
mr.
justice
brennan.
it's
resorted
to
in
many
instances
when
there
is
a
psychiatric
problem.
the
prisoner
is
sometimes
committed
to
springfield
where
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
that's
perhaps
the
only
facility
for
the
most
intensive
sort
of
psychiatric
treatment
and
diagnosis.
but
there
are
other
penitentiaries
equipped
with
psychiatrists,
psychologists,
social
workers
and
others
penologists
who
are
in
a
position
to
prepare
the
report.
report
is
then
sent
to
washington
and
is
studied
further
here,
and
here
in
washington
the
actual
recommendation
as
to
a
sentence
is
made
and
only
then
is
the
report,
the
full
report
given
to
the
judge,
sent
to
the
judge,
they
need
to
follow,
so
there
is
the
recommendation
made
by
the
prison
authorities.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice
i
am
assuming
that
the
100
year
sentence
would
be
so
outrageous,
so
disproportionate
to
the
crime
that
it
would
amount
to
a
violation
of
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
clause.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
because
i
must
accept
your
honor's
premise
that
there
is
a
supervisory
power
to
review
sentences
which
are
not,
which
are
not
cruel
and
unusual,
if
there
is
such
a
power,
but
it
is
only
exercised
where
the
most
outrageous
thought
of
sentence
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
contempt
cases
i
think
only
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
i
didn't
mean
to
debate
with
your
honor
the
existence
of
the
power.
but
assuming
that
it
is
sparingly
exercised
only
in
the
most
outrageous
cases,
i
would
suppose
that
it
would
support
a
motion
under
2255,
even
though
it'd
not
be
a
constitutional
--
violation
of
the
constitutional
right,
all
that
it
would
support
a
motion
under
the
first
portion
of
rule
35
that
is
that
it
would
be
amount
to
an
illegal
sentence
which
can
be
corrected
at
any
time
not
within
the
60
day
limit.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
i
must,
i
can't
bind
the
government
to
a
position
that
would
not
challenge
the
propriety
of
reviewing
a
sentence
that
was
not
plainly
outrageous,
but
was
merely
debatable
on
the
ground
that
sentences
are
not
normally
subject
to
review
on
appeal.
therefore
they
should
not
be
so
deep
to
review
on
collateral
proceedings
or
on
subsequent
proceedings,
unless
they
reach
the
constitutional
informative
being
cruel
and
unusual.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that's
correct
your
honor.
with
this
possible
deviation
that
if
the
defendant
chooses
not
to
--
chooses
to
begin
serving
his
sentence
despite
the
appeal
he
would
then
be
committed
to
the
penitentiary
at
which
point
the
study
could
go
full
length
and
as
we
view
it,
if
the
appeal
had
not
yet
been
determined,
the
sentencing
judge,
could
nevertheless
if
the
report
were
ready
and
submitted
to
him,
re-sentence
all
this
pending
the
appeal
that
has
been
done
in
two
cases
as
we
point
out.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
think
his
election
to
begin
serving
his
sentence
would
--
or
his
election
to
exercise
right
to
bail
would
change
the
finality
of
the
judgment
in
anyway,
because
that's
normal
election
that
the
defendant
has
on
appeal,
on
appeal
from
the
final
judgment.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no
the
only
problem
is
that
the
study
may
have
been
to
some
extent
a
waste
of
effort
on
the
part
of
prison
authorities
and
on
the
part
of
the
judge
who
went
through
the
reconsideration
when
ultimately
the
conviction
would
be
reversed,
but
we
don't
present
that
as
a
serious
obstacle.
we
do
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
might
happen
anyway
exactly.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
to
some
extent,
these
studies
were
made
anyway
whether
there
is
a
resentencing
or
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
it
requires
it
under
this
very
statute.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
they
do
serve.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
should
retract
any
implication
that
the
study
would
be
wasted
if
the
conviction
is
reversed.
if
he
is
in
a
sliding
position
on
the
trial
judge,
it
must
reconsider
sentence,
re-impose
it
when
ultimately
it
may
not
stand.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
for
myself,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
only
had
an
opportunity
to
discuss
very
briefly
during
the
luncheon
recess,
those
of
us
who
did
discuss
saw
no
problem
with
that
solution.
i'm
not
sufficiently
experienced
to
be
able
to
say
that
they
don't
exist.
i
don't
see
and
i
read
with
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
seemed
on
the
face
of
it
a
very
sensible
solution.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
thank
you.
in
this
case
we
are
presented
with
a
related
problem
under
the
same
statute,
which
is
whether
at
the
reconsideration
and
the
re-sentencing,
which
takes
place
after
the
judge
has
received
the
report
from
the
prison
authorities,
the
defendant
must
be
brought
back
before
the
judge.
in
fact
whether
a
hearing
at
all
must
be
held
at
that
time
at
which
the
defendant
should
be
returned
and
at
which
if
he
would
return,
he
would
be
entitled
to
the
right
to
just
assistance
of
counsel.
we
concede
that
if
he's
got
a
right
to
return,
he's
also
entitled
to
be
assisted
by
counsel.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
concede
that
if
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
return
personally
before
the
judge
for
re-sentencing,
he
also
has
the
right
under
rule
43
--
rule
44
i
believe
it
is
to
counsel
as
they
go
together.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
here
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
not
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
my
understanding
of
the
law
mr.
justice
black
is
that
there
is
no
appellate
review
of
the
conditions
of
probation
imposed
so
long
as
they
are
within
the
statute.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
then
of
course
it
would
amount
to
an
illegal
sentence,
which
is
subject
to
attack
under
rule
35,
first
part
of
rule
35
and
to
an
appeal
from
the
denial
of
the
vacation
of
sentence.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
ultimately
by
appeal
from
the
denial
of
the
rule
35
motion.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that's
correct.
the
respondent
behrens
was
convicted
of
attempting
to
kill
a
fellow
inmate
while
he
was
an
inmate
–
at,
himself
an
inmate
at
the
penitentiary,
the
federal
penitentiary
at
terre
haute,
indiana.
that
offense
carried
a
maximum
penalty
of
20
years.
he
was
acquitted
on
a
second
count
involving
an
assault
on
a
prison
official.
immediately
after
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
of
guilty,
the
judge
discharged
the
jury
and
still
in
open
court,
in
the
presence
of
the
defendant
and
of
his
attorney,
his
attorney
then
was
court
appointed
counsel,
subsequent
counsel
was
appointed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the
judge
discussed
the
question
of
sentencing.
he
explicitly
referred
to
or
the
alternatives
whether
he
should
impose
sentence
immediately
that
day,
whether
he
should
differ
sentence
or
wait
a
pre-sentence
report
or
whether
he
should
invoke
the
provisions
of
the
statute
before
the
court
4208
(b).
government
counsel
expressed
his
view,
defense
counsel
said
the
defendant
wanted
sentencing
today.
the
court
engaged
in
a
colloquy
directly
with
defendant
at
which
time
the
defendant
repeated
that
he
wanted
to
be
sentenced
here
and
now.
he
indicated
that
he
didn't
want,
didn't
want
the
judge
to
wait
for
a
pre-sentence
report
or
for
the
study
and
report
provided
for
under
this
statute.
there
was
further
discussion
which
i
need
not
detail,
and
ultimately
the
judge
formally
called
the
defendant
to
the
bench
and
offered
him
his
right
of
allocution.
defendant
reiterated
that
he
had
nothing
to
say.
when
pressed,
he
finally
said
to
the
judge,
“my
remarks
ain't
fit
in
your
ears.”
the
judge
persisted
and
the
defendant
persisted
in
his
refusal
to
say
anything
more,
he
just
wanted
to
get
it
over
with.
finally
the
court
imposed
sentence
under
section
4208
(b),
this
time
expressly
imposing
sentence
for
20
years
for
maximum
under
the
statute
committing
the
prisoner
for
a
study
as
provided
in
section
(c)
of
that
same
provision
and
for
reconsideration
in
three
months
after
the
report
of
the
prison
authorities
was
received.
the
court
explained
what
it
had
done
to
the
defendant
and
noted
that
he
the
judge
would
be
inclined
to
follow
the
prison
recommendation
since
this
was
really
an
offence
against
the
prison
system
one
that
had
occurred
while
at
the
penitentiary.
a
formal
judgment
and
commitment
was
entered
that
same
day
which
again
recited
the
20
years
sentence
the
maximum.
ten
days
passed
and
no
appeal
was
taken.
sometime
later
the
defendant
filed
a
motion
pro
se
before
the
trial
court
for
a
transcript
at
the
government
expense.
the
court
denied
the
motion
on
the
ground
that
the
only
purpose
of
furnishing
a
transcript
could
be
served
on
appeal,
the
time
for
appeal
had
run
and
therefore
there
was
no
occasion
to
give
the
defendant
the
transcript
to
the
trial
proceedings.
no
appeal
was
taken
from
that
ruling.
finally
on
june
9th
something
just
short
of
six
months,
the
time
for
the
report
having
been
expended
in
the
meantime
by
the
judge,
the
report
of
the
prison
authorities
was
received
by
the
judge
recommending
that
a
sentence
of
five
years
be
imposed.
on
june
13,
1963
which
is
something
under
six
months
from
the
date
of
the
original
sentence
the
judge
entered
a
new
order
reducing
the
20
years
sentence
to
five
years.
he
did
so
without
holding
a
hearing
not
in
the
presence
of
the
defendant.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
did
though
that
may
not
be
in
the
record,
but
it
is
--
it
is
a
fact.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
we
no
appeal
taken
from
this
judgment.
finally
on
april
11th,
1962
many
months
later
the
defendants
pro
se
filed
a
motion
under
section
2255
in
which
he
made
several
allegations
with
respect
to
trail
errors
also
alleged
that
he
had
been
a
motion
for
a
mental
examination
before
trial
with
reference
to
his
competency
(inaudible)
and
he
complained
about
the
judge's
remarks
and
interrogation
of
him
at
the
original
sentence
but
he
said
nothing
about
the
denial
of
his
right
to
be
present
at
the
re-sentencing.
the
court
denied
the
motion
without
hearing.
the
court
of
appeal
--
well
on
appeal
for
the
first
time
the
defendant
raised
this
question
of
his
right
to
be
present
at
the
modification
of
sentence
in
his
own
presence
and
presence
of
his
counsel.
the
court
of
appeal
agreed
with
the
position
of
the
appellant,
remanded
the
case
for
re-sentencing
in
the
presence
of
the
defendant
and
with
the
benefit
of
counsel,
but
explicitly
did
not
disturb
the
underlying
conviction.
there
is
no
vacation
of
the
conviction,
merely
a
remand
for
re-sentencing.
petitioner
had
not
sought
review
from
the
ruling
below
insofar
as
it
offends
his
conviction.
only
the
government
has
petitioned,
therefore,
the
only
question
before
the
court
at
this
time
is
whether
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
be
personally
present
and
to
have
the
assistance
of
counsel
at
the
modification
of
sentence
which
occurred
on
june
13th
1961.
we
approach
this
question
first
as
one
of
statutory
construction.
on
that
basis
and
insofar
as
congress
was
free
to
answer
the
question,
it
seems
to
us
very
clear
that
it
adds
it
in
the
negative
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
return
the
defendant
before
the
judge
at
the
time
his
sentence
would
be
modified.
the
first
congressional
report
which
is
the
house
report
which
embodies
legislation
exactly
as
it
now
reads
is
to
the
point
on
this
subject.
unfortunately
we
do
not
quote
in
our
brief
the
pertinent
potion,
though
we
do
refer
to
it
but
the
report
at
page
10
says
this,
“after
receiving
from
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
a
summary
of
this
study
the
court
in
fixing
the
final
penalty
may
affirm
the
original
sentence
or
impose
a
modified
sentence
under
any
applicable
law.
the
prisoner
would
not
have
to
be
present
in
the
court
when
this
final
action
on
his
sentence
is
taken.
in
as
much
the
original
sentence
of
the
court
represents
the
maximum
authorized
by
statute,
any
later
modifications
by
the
court
would
constitute
a
reduction
in
the
sentence.”
there
is
an
ample
precedent
for
this
provision.
the
last
line
of
rule
43
reads
the
defendants'
presence
is
not
required
in
reduction
of
a
sentence
under
rule
35.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
quote
the
advice,
the
note
of
the
advisory
committee
on
this
last
sentence
rule
43
and
they're
quoting
full
rule
35,
nothing
could
be
more
explicit.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
is
the
house
committee
report.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it's
referred
to
and
quoted
in
part
at
page
24
of
our
brief.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
now
this
--
i
emphasize
that
this
report
was
made
at
a
time
when
the
legislation
was
in
its
present
form.
this
is
the
most
complete
report
and
subsequently
the
matter
was
reported
by
the
senate
and
there
was
a
joint
conference
report,
each
of
which
embody
we
think
the
same
idea,
but
in
shorter
form.
senate
report
refers
to
this
provision
as
an
extended
rule
35,
so
does
the
joint
conference
report.
again,
rule
35
of
course
does
not
require
reappearance
of
the
defendant.
now
the
text
of
4208
(b),
it
is
true,
did
not
expressly
embody
this
waiver
of
the
defendant's
presence,
but
if
we
must
fit
the
new
provision
in
to
the
pattern
of
the
existing
rules,
it
seems
basically
clear
that
his
presence
would
not
be
required.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
i
would
agree
with
your
honor
that
if
it
was
important
action
on
his
case,
i
think
to
a
prisoner
the
extent
of
his
sentence
is
sometimes
more
important
than
other
procedural
aspects
of
the
case,
but
it
doesn't
follow
we
suggest
that
he
would
have
anything
much
to
add
or
to
contribute
at
that
time.
the
fact
that
it
is
important
to
him
does
not
mean
that
he
must
be
personally
present
at
that
time
anymore
then
he
need
be
personally
present
when
some
different
actions
were
taken
with
reference
to
his
ultimate
sentence.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
i
would
--
first
mr.
chief
justice
i
think
the
right
of
allocution
has
two
parts.
historically
it
was
not
addressed
to
the
question
of
litigation
of
sentence,
it
was
addressed
to
bar
--
to
any
sentence.
traditional
question
and
the
question
recited
in
our
own
rules
of
criminal
procedure
is
having
given
the
defendant
the
right
to
say
why
sentence
should
not
be
pronounced
not
what
sentence
should
be
pronounced,
but
i
recognize
the
right
is
also
one
to
make
a
plea
of
convenience
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
first
say
that
he
has
already
been
given
a
right
of
allocution.
now
the
question
here
is
not
when
he
should
be
given
the
right
of
allocution
whether
at
the
time
of
the
first
sentencing
or
at
the
time
of
the
re-sentencing,
he
must
be
given
a
right
of
allocution
at
the
time
of
the
first
sentencing
if
only
to
respect
the
part
of
the
rule
that
permits
him
to
state
a
bar
to
anything.
now
the
only
question
remaining
if
it
was
--
whether
he
has
the
right
to
repeat
his
plead
of
leniency.
certainly
he
can
argue
that
it
would
be
more
effective
to
do
so
at
a
time
when
the
judge
is
more
focusing
on
the
length
of
the
sentence
he
is
going
to
impose,
but
we
must
assume
that
the
decision
to
invoke
4208
(b)
has
occurred
only
after
the
judge
has
listened
to
the
defendant,
has
appraised
the
plea
(inaudible).
we
must
also
assume
that
the
judge
having
heard
the
mitigating
facts
as
presented
by
the
defendant
has
not
forgotten
them
at
the
time
he
re-sentences.
and
he
hasn't
forgotten
them
partly
because
the
record
itself,
the
study
which
has
been
undertaken
evaluates
his
plea
in
a
meaningful
way.
it
repeats
the
information
which
the
defendant
has
given
at
least
if
it's
true.
the
study
itself
involves
several
interviews
with
the
defendant.
all
of
this
material
is
incorporated
in
a
report
which
is
then
presented
to
the
judge,
this
in
itself
refreshes
the
judge's
recollection
of
what
had
occurred
before,
but
more
importantly
to
some
extent
it
supersedes
what
has
been
told.
it
evaluates
the
factors
in
mitigation
which
have
been
brought
to
the
judge's
attention
initially
and
its
very
completeness
leaves
very
little
chance
of
anything
pertinent
escaping
the
judge's
attention
at
the
time
when
he
finally
imposed
the
sentence.
nor
can
it
argued
that
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
traverse
the
representations
made
in
the
study
nor
can
he
be
--
nor
can
a
right
in
him
be
recognized
to
debate
the
question
of
sentence
with
the
judge.
i
think
the
decision
in
williams
versus
new
york
explains
more
eloquently
than
i
can
why
the
judge
must
act
on
ex-parte
information
at
the
time
of
sentencing
if
he
is
going
to
really
take
into
the
consideration
all
the
relevant
factors
and
why
as
a
practical
matter
this
report
–
there
the
question
was
about
a
pre-sentence
report,
here
it's
even
more
thorough
report
why
it
cannot
be
divulged,
why
it
cannot
be
made
a
subject
to
cross
examination.
there
is
no
occasion
of
the
defendant
at
this
late
date
to
add
very
much.
now
we
do
think
the
district
judge
if
he
has
a
question,
if
he
wants
to
refresh
himself,
if
he
wants
to
impress
upon
the
defendant
the
punishment
he
is
going
to
meet
out,
of
course
he
can
recall
defendant,
many
judges
do.
sentencing
institutes
and
reports
of
it
indicate
that
several
judges
feel
that
it
is
a
sound
practice.
i
think
it
also
reflects
that
most
of
them
feel
that
it
is
not
a
rigid,
inflexible
requirement
and
in
the
case
we
simply
argue
that
it
should
not
that
as
--
i
think
mr.
justice
black
said
in
williams
versus
new
york
there
should
be
no
freezing
of
the
sentencing
procedure
in
the
mold
of
the
rules
of
evidence
as
applicable
to
trial,
i'm
paraphrasing
it
liberally,
it's
just
that.
the
judge
should
be
allowed
to
decide
in
his
own
discretion
whether
any
useful
purpose
would
be
served
by
returning
the
defendant
for
a
further
allocution.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
concede
that
if
you
should
decide
the
corey
case
against
--
well
adversely
to
the
position
taken
by
the
government
then
you
must
likewise
decide.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
he
will
be
entitled
for
the
presence
at
least
for
the
reason
that
at
that
time
especially
if
he
is
unrepresented,
he
is
entitled
to
be
advised
as
to
his
rights
of
appeal
and
for
that
reason
he
should
be
present.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
would
also
be
true,
but
as
a
practical--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
i
am
correctly
saying
that
statute
--
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
is
patently
clear
that
there
is
no
such
a
crime
that
does
not
answer
the
question
because
there
may
be
a
constitutional
of
due
process
required.
we
don't
think
it's
a
sixth
amendment
right
because
this
isn't
a
matter
of
confrontation
of
witnesses.
the
opinion
in
williams
versus
new
york
points
out
very
well
the
difference
between
the
right
of
confrontation
at
trial
and
the
lack
of
any
such
right
with
reference
to
the
information
on
which
sentencing
is
based.
the
most
that
can
be
said
for
this
claim
is
that
it
falls
the
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
did
not
include
section
(b),
the
particular
portion,
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
for
that
--
all
of
that
is
correct
your
honor,
and
we
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
take
it
that
the
statement
is
a
comment
on
the
bill
as
it
stood
when
it
came
out
of
committee,
which
is
exactly
as
it
now
stands.
it
is
the
most
--
is
the
first
and
the
most
authoritative
and
the
most
complete
interpretation
of
the
language
of
the
present
statute,
the
fact
that
the
house
itself
deleted
this
provision
and
subsequently
in
conference
with
the
senate
agreed
to
it's
--
being
put
back
in
the
bill
does
not
in
anyway,
it
seems
to
me
nullify
this
first
interpretation
of
the
provision
as
it
now
stands.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
committee
report
was
of
course
available
to
the
senate
when
it
considered
the
matter.
the
senate
report
is
much
shorter.
it
to
some
extent
repeats
the
house
report,
but
it
very
explicitly
assimilates
this
procedure
to
a
rule
35
reduction,
which
we
think
it
itself
is
enough
to
show
that
the
defendants'
presence
is
not
necessary.
finally
we
say
that
it
would
be
a
shame
to
discourage
the
use
of
this
modern,
enlightened
procedure
which
is
after
all
intended
for
the
benefit
of
defendants,
which
is
optional
with
the
judge
in
which
he
therefore
can
fail
to
invoke
if
it
becomes
too
burdensome
by
putting
it
into
a
rigid
mode
by
imposing
an
inflexible
requirement
of
presence
at
every
recess.
we
think
the
matter
should
be
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judges
who
doubtless
(inaudible)
appropriate
instances
requires
defendant
to
be
returned.
for
these
reasons
we
think
the
judgment
should
be
with
us.
