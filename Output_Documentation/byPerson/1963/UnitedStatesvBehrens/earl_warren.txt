earl
warren
number
86,
united
states,
petitioner,
versus
kenneth
leroy
behrens.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
claiborne
may
i
â€“
i'll
ask
you
one
more
question,
we'll
give
you
a
little
time,
more
time
the
other
one
too,
but
i
want
to
ask
this
question,
now
in
this
case
as
i
understand
the
maximum
punishment
was
375
years
and
$750,000.
suppose
the
judge
took
that
function
under
this
section
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
should
have
not
375
years,
but
that
he
should
have
a
100
years
in
other
words,
he
reduced
it
to
a
100
years
and
he
wanted,
the
defendant
wanted
to
challenge
that
sentence
and
wanted
to
appeal
to
our
supervisory
powers
and
it
happened
more
than
60
days
after
the
original
sentence
and
couldn't
come
under
say
rule
35,
how
would
he,
how
would
he
appeal
to
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
let's
put
it
down
to
a
point
where,
where
it
isn't,
where
it
isn't
cruel
and
inhuman
punishment
under
the
constitution,
but
it
is
grossly,
grossly
excessive
to
the
crime
itself
and
he
wanted
to
appeal
to
the
supervisory
powers
of
this
court.
how
could
he
ever
get
to,
get
that
issue
raised,
if
he
had
to
take
his
appeal
before
his
final
sentence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
have
exercised
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
think
so,
then
these
guys
are
sending
men
to
penitentiary
for
five
years
and
six
years
for
contempt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
think
the
government
would
be
--
resist
that
on
procedural
grounds.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
claiborne
would
you
see
any
see
any
administrative
problems
if
the
congress
should
provide
that
a
defendant
in
those
circumstances
might
bring
his
appeal
that
either
time
that
he
chose
to
do
so
either
the
original
sentence
or
when
the
final
sentence
came
down?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
have
five
or
ten
minutes
more
for
your
argument
in
this
case
and
we
take
it
that
the
counsel
from
other
side
want
same
amount
of
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
claiborne
don't
you
think
if
(inaudible)
is
to
be
meaningful
that
this
should
be
done
or
permitted
at
a
time
when
it
will
have
some
real
bearing
upon
the
sentence
if
the
judge
is
to
impose
and
if
the
judge
says
that
the
original
time
of
sentence
were
either
i
don't
know
--
i
have
enough
information
about
this
and
i'll
put
it
all
over
until
we
hear
from
the
prison
authorities
and
then
the
man
is
not
permitted
to
--
the
man
is
not
permitted
to
say
anything
after
he
has
gotten
that
information
that
allocution
means
very
little.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
isn't
perhaps
the
way
--
the
sense
in
which
the
allocution
is
known
the
present
time.
in
another
words,
if
you
are
asked
that
if
you
had
an
legal
grounds
that's
showed,
you
wouldn't
ask
him
you
would
ask
his
counsel
anyway.
but
the
statute
provides
that
he
personally
must
be
asked
if
he
has
anything
to
say
and
it
--
doesn't
that
mean
for
the
purpose
of
litigate
punishment
if
he
has
anything
to
say
in
that
regard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
young.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
that
you
are
appointed
to
represent
this
defendant
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
you
not
only
carried
the
case
through
that
court,
but
carried
that
through
this
court
and
i
would
want
you
to
know
that
we
appreciate
the
fact
that
you
would
that.
we
all
appreciate
the
willingness
of
lawyers
to
represent
the
defendants
in
this
manner.
so
we
do
appreciate
it.
mr.
claiborne
we
appreciate
the
fair
manner
and
frank
manner
in
which
you
represented
the
government
in
this
matter.
we
thank
you
both.
