mr.
aribert
l.
young
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
the
question
as
i
understand
it
as
far
as
the
behrens'
case
is
concerned
is
basically
whether
or
not
mr.
behrens
was
required
to
be
present
at
the
time
the
final
determination
was
made
under
4208
(b)?
of
course
ancillary
to
that
whether
or
not
at
that
time
it
was
also
necessary
that
counsel
be
present?
if
i
understand
the
government's
argument
right
i
believe
the
government
does
contend
now
that
if
the
judgment
was
not
final
until
the
court
had
received
the
report
from
the
bureau
of
prisons
under
4208
(b),
they
concede
that
mr.
behrens
should
have
been
present
and
that
his
counsel
should
have
been
present.
i
didn't
quite
interpret
their
brief
that
way,
but
i
believe
that
is
the
way
i
have
understood
the
argument
on
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
quite
basic
and
decided
in
this
court
in
many
decisions
of
course
that
a
criminal
defendant
is
entitled
to
be
represented
by
counsel
at
every
stage
of
the
proceeding.
i
think
this
is
set
forth
in
the
rules,
rule
43
of
the
federal
rules
as
the
defendant,
rule
44
as
to
right
of
counsel
and
of
course
this
court
in
johnson
verses
zerbst
304
us
citied
in
the
brief
very
clearly
set
that
forth
and
points
out
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel
at
all
stages
of
the
proceeding
under
the
sixth
amendment
and
that
the
right
of
counsel
is
an
essential
jurisdictional
prerequisite
to
the
court's
authority
to
act,
and
there
are
numerous
cases
following
that
which
are
cited
in
the
brief.
the
second
point
seems
to
be
whether
or
not
in
a
4208
(b)
proceeding
when
a
sentence
is
made
final,
and
as
i
read
the
statute
there
is
no
sentence
until
after
a
court
has
finally
determined
after
receiving
the
bureau
of
prison's
report,
i
believe
the
first
proceeding
is
merely
tentative
i
think
that
is
the
obvious
intent
of
the
legislature.
we
can
go
into
a
lot
of
things
regarding
legislative
history,
but
i
think
this
court
in
the
case
corey
versus
united
states
i
think
it's
in
part
a
dissent
but
the
point
is
basic
and
i
don't
think
there
was
any
disagreement
on
the
basic
point,
clearly
sets
forth
consensus
and
states
that
often
times
it
is
difficult
to
determine
what
the
legislative
history
of
an
act
is.
as
is
already
been
pointed
out
this
afternoon
the
house
report
says
one
thing
and
we
have
to
provide
conjecture
i
believe
to
assume
that
the
senate
was
thinking
of
the
same
thing
when
they
passed
the
bill,
but
in
corey
versus
united
states
i
think
this
statement
and
substance
is
made,
when
it's
difficult
to
determine
what
the
legislative
intention
was,
then
the
court
should
proceed
cautiously
being
sensitive
to
the
rights
of
the
defendant
and
to
the
society
in
general.
and
perhaps
one
of
the
best
tools
we
can
use
is
to
apply
commonsense
to
determine
what
the
legislative
intent
was.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
case
if
we
do
apply
legislative
intent,
legislative
–
if
we
try
and
determine
the
legislative
intent
we
have
to
apply
common
sense
to
those
matters,
and
i
don't
see
as
a
practical
matter
how
counsel
in
one
of
these
cases
can
confidently
advise
the
defendant
at
the
time
the
judge
first
involved
4208
(b)
as
to
what
the
man
should
do.
i
don't
believe
that
there
will
be
many
counsel
representing
these
men
that
would
want
to
tell
them
to
go
ahead
and
start
your
appeal
because
we
can't
tell
what's
going
to
happen
under
this
4208
(b)
proceeding.
i
think
it
puts
the
defendant
into
sort
of
an
indirect
compulsion
if
he
is
forced
to
appeal
from
this
tentative
sentencing
and
i
think
that's
all
it
is
when
the
court
first
applies
4208
(b).
i
certainly
would
not
want
the
responsibility
if
i
could
avoid
it
of
having
to
tell
a
man
to
go
ahead
and
appeal
even
though
there
maybe
a
good
chance
that
the
man
will
be
given
a
substantially
reduced
sentence.
of
course
that
has
occurred
in
the
corey
case
or
it's
possible
that
he
may
even
receive
probation.
i
think
and
these
men,
their
hope
springs
eternal
they
all
think
they
are
going
to
get
complete
probation.
we
know
as
a
practical
matter,
that
not
too
many
of
them
do,
but
that's
a
feeling
that
these
men
are
going
to
have
i
believe.
many
of
them
really
believe
they'll
get
at
least
probation.
so
how
are
they
going
to
be
in
position
to
make
an
intelligent
decision
to
go
ahead
and
appeal
at
a
time
like
that
when
there
really
hasn't
been
any
final
determination
at
all?
mr.
aribert
l.
young
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that
if
the
government
succeeds
in
the
corey
case
we
still
had
a
basic
right
involved
in
this
behrens'
case
of
a
man's
right
to
be
present
at
every
stage
of
a
proceeding
and
of
a
man's
right
to
have
representation
by
counsel.
i
think
that
there
are
many
things
that
can
occur
at
this
final
sentencing.
perhaps
the
man
was
hostile
and
arrogant
at
the
time
of
trial,
perhaps
the
man
did
perjure
himself
and
these
are
foremost
in
the
court's
mind,
the
judges'
mind
at
that
time.
as
the
government
has
pointed
out
it's
usually
six
months
before
this
final
report
is
in,
or
maybe
from
three
to
six
months
supposing
the
man
at
that
time
is
(inaudible),
supposing
that
he
wants
to
do
better
perhaps
the
man
has
had
a
mental
problem
and
this
has
been
helped
by
the
psychiatric
treatment
he
has
had
while
in
the
custody
of
bureau
of
prisons,
i
think
these
are
things
that
should
be
called
to
the
court's
attention
at
that
time.
mr.
aribert
l.
young
i
am
not
referring
to
just
things
in
the
report,
i
think
that
there
would
be
things
that
can
occur
from
that
initial
sentencing
or
tentative
sentencing
up
to
the
time
the
court
finally
considers
it.
they
maybe
in
a
report,
but
again
they
may
not.
the
state
of
the
man's
mind
may
not
necessarily
be
reflected
in
the
psychiatric
report
that
will
be
submitted
the
bureau
of
prisons.
i
think
further
this
point
has
validity,
i
think
that
with
the
burden
that
our
federal
judges
have,
which
as
we
all
know
is
increasing,
but
six
months
later
that
the
federal
judge
is
not
going
to
have
the
same
feel
of
that
case
that
he
would
have
if
he
had
the
man
there
before
him.
if
the
man
himself,
if
he
has
something
constructive
to
say
within
the
limits
provided
and
the
man's
counsel
has
something
to
say,
i
think
the
court
should
be
asked
to
hear
it
and
consider
it
at
that
time.
i
think
this
is
only
time
the
court
is
going
to
make
any
serious
consideration
of
soul
searching
as
to
the
type
of
punishment
that
will
fit
the
crime
or
this
particular
individual
and
i
think
it
should
be
more
and
just
some
papers
and
the
recollection
of
what
transpired
perhaps
as
in
most
cases
six
months
before.
i
think
the
right
of
allocution
cannot
be
effectively
exercised
and
used
except
at
that
time.
go
back
to
the
other
end
of,
the
judge
is
going
to
use
4208
(b).
now
the
trial
counsel
and
the
defendant
does
not
know
what
this
report
from
the
bureau
of
prisons
is
going
to
show,
is
counsel
going
to
advise
the
man
to
make
a
plea
for
his
allocution
at
that
time?
i
think
that
the
man
there's
under
a
burden
if
he
tries
to
present
everything
at
that
time
without
the
corey
having
the
effect
or
the
knowledge
of
the
matters
contained
in
the
bureau
of
prisons'
report.
i
think
this
would
affect
the
whole
way
it
was
handled.
i
realize
that
the
judge
does
not
have
to
let
defense
counsel
know
what
the
bureau
of
prisons
report
contains,
but
i
think
many
of
our
district
judges
would
particularly
when
these
men
are
represented
by
popular
counsel.
i
think
that
everything
cannot
be
in
the
report
and
i
do
not
believe
that
the
right
of
allocution
can
be
effectively
or
meaningfully
exercised
except
at
that
final
time.
mr.
aribert
l.
young
well
your
honor
i
think
it's
conceivable
that
the
man
could
have
been
(inaudible)
at
that
particular
time
and
--
mr.
aribert
l.
young
well
i
think
when
the
court
makes
a
final
sentencing
and
under
4208
(b)
as
in
this
case
the
judge
gave
five
years,
this
maybe
exactly
what
it
should
be.
on
the
other
hand
if
the
defendant
had
been
present
and
had
had
the
right
of
allocution
by
himself
or
through
a
counsel,
the
judge
might
have
decided
it
should
have
been
two
years,
this
i
do
not
know.
mr.
aribert
l.
young
it's
20
initially,
your
honor.
mr.
aribert
l.
young
at
the
final
--
mr.
aribert
l.
young
well
i
think
he
could
have
brought
forth
many
of
these
things
that
i
have
tried
to
list
it,
it
can
occur
other
cases?
mr.
aribert
l.
young
he
could
have
given
a
complete
probation
as
i
understand?
mr.
aribert
l.
young
yes.
mr.
aribert
l.
young
as
i
understand
--
mr.
aribert
l.
young
that's
my
understand
anything
in
between.
i
think
some
of
the
problems
that
we
have
and
i
am
going
back
a
little
bit
to
some
of
the
matters
connected
with
the
corey
case
because
the
two
of
course
are
still
tied
up
together,
it's
difficult
to
separate
them,
but
i
think
we
have
a
difficulty
if
the
final
sentencing,
which
i
believe
is
the
only
sentencing
under
4208
(b)
is
not
the
one
that
we
have
to
appeal
from.
i
think
if
we
have
to
appeal
from
the
tentative
commitment,
and
i
think
that's
all
it
actually
is,
the
case
goes
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
court
of
appeals
of
course
doesn't
know
what
the
sentence
is
going
to
be.
i
think
we
may
get
into
the
problem
of
separate
appeals,
two
appeals
on
the
case,
one
on
the
case
initially
and
then
perhaps
the
second
appeal
where
the
sentence
perhaps
is
in
some
case
is
unreasonable
and
the
court
of
appeals
or
this
court
would
need
to
apply
its
discretionary
powers
to
review
sentences.
i
know
this
would
not
happen
often
but
it
certainly
can
happen
in
certain
cases.
i
think
it
would
be
unfortunate
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
to
decide
on
appeal
without
knowing
what
the
sentence
is
going
to
be
and
there
is
a
problem
also
where
this
concurrent
sentence
is
involved
on
several
different
counts.
under
this
why
you
would
--
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
will
have
to
consider
perhaps
some
error
under
a
concurrent
sentence
on
an
unchallenged
count
that
they
wouldn't
decide
if
they
don't
want
the
sentence
the
judge
was
going
to
impose.
i
think
it
presents
many,
almost
intolerable
problems
that
i
don't
believe
necessarily
arrives
if
we
go
by
what
i
concede
understandably
the
established
rule
of
law
that
a
sentence
is
not
final
until
there
is
nothing
else
that's
to
be
done.
of
course
i
think
one
of
the
leading
cases
on
that
is
corey
versus
united
states
and
i
don't
really
believe
that
there
is
any
serious
question
about
that,
it's
been
borrowed
repeatedly.
i
think
it's
quite
clear
the
final
judgment,
a
criminal
case
means
these
sentences
and
in
this
particular
case
i
think
the
trial
judge
in
his
words
and
it's
set
out
in
the
brief
realized
that
he
wasn't
making
a
final
sentence
on
this
man
when
the
commitment
was
made.
here
is
the
words
of
the
trail
judge
when
he
made
this
commitment
in
the
beginning
and
this
is
what
the
trial
judge
said,
explaining
this
to
mr.
behrens.
he
says,
“and
i
think
after
about
three
months,
when
everybody
has
had
an
opportunity
to
reflect
upon
your
case
quite
fairly
that
we
should
be
able
to
come
up
with
a
same
civil
disposition
of
your
case,”
like
the
trial
judge
himself
recognized
--
he
wasn't
making
these
sentence
when
this
man
was
committed
under
4208
(b)
and
i
think
the
statute
itself
it
says
these
sentence.
in
the
first
paragraph,
the
first
sentence
of
4208
(b)
says
these
sentences,
what
it
actually
shall
be.
going
back
to
corey
versus
united
states,
another
case
of
course
before
that
and
one
of
the
leading
one,
leading
ones
is
berman
versus
united
states
cited
in
the
brief
and
of
course
there
the
point
again
arises
during
the
pendency
of
an
appeal
from
a
sentence
the
district
court
is
without
jurisdiction
to
modify
its
judgment
by
resentencing
the
defendant,
resentence
is
the
judgment.
as
i
understand
these
previous
opinions
of
this
court
there
can
only
be
the
one
sentence
and
there
is
this
sentence,
as
into
final
one,
i
think
we're
in
real
problems
when
the
court
later
comes
in
and
tries
to
in
effect
re-sentence
under
this
4208
(b).
but
i
think
the
practical
approach
to
the
whole
thing
is
that
there
be
a
determination
of
the
time
that
the
appeal
is
to
run
from.
mr.
aribert
l.
young
but
this
court
has
said
there
is
only
one,
one
judgment
that's
the
--
mr.
aribert
l.
young
yes
sir,
i
think
that's
--
mr.
aribert
l.
young
i
believe
there
was
tentative
period
in
my
impression.
mr.
aribert
l.
young
no
sir.
mr.
aribert
l.
young
yes
sir.
mr.
aribert
l.
young
(inaudible)
it
all
up
irrespective
of
whether
it
was
final
in
the
first
instance
or
not,
we
do
feel
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
behrens
that
the
right
of
counsel
and
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
be
present
is
such
a
basic
right
that
it
should
be
provided
for
so
that
there
can
be
no
question
about
it.
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
great
hardship
upon
the
government,
and
i
do
think
that
it
is
for
the
benefit
of
defendants
and
society
in
general
that
the
man
have
the
opportunity
for
these
studies
ahead
of
time
that
the
court
believes
that
it
is
proper
and
discretionary
and
that
he
is
not
put
under
sort
of
indirect
compulsion
to
not
appeal
because
of
the
possibility
offending
someone
by
doing
so.
that's
all
that
i
have
to
say
at
this
time
unless
there
is
something
the
court
would
like
to
enquire
about.
mr.
aribert
l.
young
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
court.
