justice
hugo
l.
black
would
he
have
a
right
to
appeal
the
final
judgment
where
the
judge
cut
it
down
and
tried
to
put
him
on
probation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
suppose
if
the
judge
changed
it
considerably
and
put
him
on
probation
and
put
terms
if
he
wanted
to
attack.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they're
bound
to
it,
but
not
within
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
there
would
he
could
attack
it
but
not
by
appeal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
instead
of
just
the
judgment
itself
direct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
change
could
have
been
affected
here
by
the
judge
of
importance
to
the
defendant
at
this
last
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
not
talking
about
the
defendant,
what
change
could
the
judge
have
made
in
the
punishment,
he
was
to
suffer
in
the
kind
of
conviction,
now
of
course
he
was
to
be
punished
alright,
anything
of
that,
what
changes
could
the
judge
have
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
am
getting
at,
what
change
could
give
me,
forget
allocution
and
lawyer
and
everything
else,
when
the
judge
went
in
there,
he
had
a
sentence
of
what,
five
years
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
20,
what
could
he
have
done
when
he
got
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
the
last
stage.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what,
what
sentence
could
he
have
--
how
low
could
he
have
reduced
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
complete
probation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
at
this
last
hearing,
it
depended
on
whether
he
would
be
given
the
original
20
years
or
complete
probation
one
year
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
guess
what
you
really
have
is
a
(inaudible)
a
judgment,
first
judgment,
final
as
to
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
makes
it
the
final,
but
the
other
one
does
not
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
legal
sense
as
distinguished
from
the
common
ordinary
meaning
of
filing,
of
course
the
question
was
tentative,
what's
the
time
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it,
do
you
think
it
was
tentative
insofar
as
the
finding
of
guilt
was
concerned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
that's
(inaudible)
response.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
other
one
(inaudible)
