(inaudible)
confirmed
by
the
board
and
confirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
these
defendants.
i
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
in
some
point
of
the
record,
either
for
(inaudible)
the
board's
findings
or
how
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
so
there
is
no
disagreement
or
objection.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
court
of
appeals
to
reverse
the
board.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
there's
no
disagreement
with
the
board's
findings.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
the
sense
of
the
matter
is
the
question
of
law.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
unless
(inaudible)
review
of
the
finding.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
know
it's
not
correct
that
the
supreme
--
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
before
this
court's
decision
during
the
district.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
business
language.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
the
subject
of
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
refer
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
so
at
least
in
epithet,
there's
a
(inaudible)
aside
to
the
question
of
whether
both
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
so
that
one
assumes
that
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
are
you
informing
that
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
wasn't
intent
to
influence
the
outcome
of
the
election
because
the
court
said
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
in
other
words,
to
this
day,
you
have
to
assume
on
this
at
the
(inaudible)
court
of
appeals
has
(inaudible)
finding
that
there
was
an
intent
to
(inaudible)
the
outcome
of
the
representation
election.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
your
(voice
overlap)--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
argument
being
related
to
judge
wisdom
(inaudible)
understand
but
you
don't
go
beyond
persuasion.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
would
you
say
what
was
done
will
go
beyond
persuade?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
he
did
as
to
benefits.
he
went
beyond
the
thing
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
does
that
mean,
mr.
mueller,
that
this
employer
could
(inaudible)
against
the
union
in
this
case,
outright
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
you're
--
i
think,
leaving
the
(inaudible)
court
of
appeals
and
if
that
there
was
an
intent
to
these
benefits
to
influence
the
result
of
the
election
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
reason
of
that
intent
is
not
part
of
the
statute
is
that
(inaudible)
not
coercive,
in
fact
there
was
no
indication
that
the
benefits
were
promised
(inaudible)
the
statement
that
(inaudible)
withdrawn
if
they
voted
against
(inaudible)
now,
if,
i
ask
you
the
question,
assuming
the
court
of
appeals
possibly
that
you're
the
manager,
you
gave
$1000
to
each
men,
outright,
the
question
withdrawn
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
there's
no
logic
of
your
position
on
the
court
of
appeals
that
that's
perfectly
alright
under
the
statute,
that's
persuasive
and
not
a
coercion?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
when
you
read
the
court
of
appeals
then
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
in
127
of
the
record?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
