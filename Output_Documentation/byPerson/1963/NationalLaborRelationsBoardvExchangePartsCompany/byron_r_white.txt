but
mr.
manoli,
i
--
you're
not
suggesting
that
--
that
there
must
be
proved
that
the
employees
realize
what
the
employer's
intent
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
assuming
the
only
evidence
--
assuming
that
this
is
--
that
--
what
he
--
what
he
puts
into
effect
is
that
something
--
some
normal
increment
that
happened
every
year
but
--
but
there
is
various
evidence
that
he
is
--
he
is
told
people
and
not
his
employees
but
he's
told
people
and
it
is
admitted
that
my
purpose
for
doing
this
is
to
--
is
to
influence
this
election.
there's
no
question
that's
what
my
purpose
is.
you've
got
solid
evidence
that
that
was
his
intent.
but
the
employees
don't
know
anything
about
that
intent.
and
it
reflects
something
that
puts
the
normal
thing
to
do.
i
suppose
you'd
still
argue
there
was
a
violation.
justice
byron
r.

irregardless
of
what
the
employees
know.
justice

that
isn't
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
board
--
the
board
spells
out
the
finding
of
intent
from
the
very
facts
that
are
evident
to
everybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
from
the
--
from
the
facts
that
are
--
that
are
evident
to
everyone.
justice
byron
r.
white
evident
to
the
employees.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
--
didn't
the
board
give
the
position
that
the
hearing
before
the
examiner
--
didn't
the
board
take
the
position
before
the
examiner
and
before
the
board
that
there
was
an
unfair
--
well,
didn't
it
take
the
position
as
motive
or
intent
was
irrelevant?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
trial
examiner
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
was
the
board's
position
that
--
that
in
any
circumstances
in
nearly
granting
their
benefits,
pending
an
election,
is
--
is
not
permissible
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
regardless
of
motive,
that
was
their
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
examiner
did
find
and
the
board
adopted
its
findings
that
granting
the
foregoing
benefits
--
that
the
company
granted
the
foregoing
benefits
in
--
in
order
to
interfere
with
restraining
coerce
(voice
overlap)--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
examiner
did
find
that
but
he
went
right
on
and
said
that
internal
motive
is
irrelevant
and
immaterial
anyway.
