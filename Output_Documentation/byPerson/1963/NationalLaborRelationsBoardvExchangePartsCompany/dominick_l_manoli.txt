mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit.
the
case
arises
of
course
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
that
act
makes
it
unlawful
for
an
employer
to
interfere
with
or
restrain
or
coerce
the
employer's
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
right
to
engage
in
self-organization
and
to
select
bargaining
representatives
of
their
own
choosing.
our
problem
here
is
whether
an
employer
violates
the
statutory
prohibition
when
in
the
course
of
a
union's
organizing
efforts,
campaign
and
immediately
prior
to
a
board
election,
he
grants
to
the
employees
economic
benefits
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
them
to
reject
the
union
but
without
expressly
conditioning
the
benefits
upon
the
employees
voting
against
the
union.
the
facts
which
underlie
this
controversy
are
not
in
dispute
and
i
shall
summarize
them
briefly.
on
october
of
1959,
the
boilermakers
union
began
a
campaign
to
organize
the
company's
employees
which
numbered
approximately
230.
on
november
9th
of
that
year,
the
boilermakers
wrote
to
the
company
stating
that
the
majority
employees
had
designated
it
as
their
--
as
the
bargaining
representative
and
requesting
the
company
need
to
meet
for
the
purpose
of
negotiating
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
company
apparently
did
not
respond
to
this
letter.
and
on
november
--
november
16th
--
on
november
16th,
the
union
filed
a
petition
with
the
labor
board
asking
the
board
to
hold
an
election
for
the
purpose
of
formally
determining
whether
the
employees
wish
to
be
represented
by
the
boilermakers
union
for
purpose
of
collective
bargaining.
on
february
19th,
the
board,
after
customary
proceedings,
directed
that
an
election
be
held
and
the
election
was
scheduled
for
march
18th.
now,
in
the
inner
goal,
the
company
made
no
secret
of
its
hostility
to
the
union
and
sought
to
persuade
and
induce
the
employees
to
reject
the
union.
on
february
25th
of
1960,
some
three
weeks,
approximately
three
weeks
before
the
election,
the
company's
vice-president
had
a
company
sponsored
dinner,
spoke
to
the
employees
about
the
--
the
pending
election.
he
called
attention
--
he
attacks
--
he
criticized
the
union.
he
attacks
the
union
for
having
allegedly
misrepresented
certain
benefits
that
the
company
had
given
to
the
employees.
he
also
call
attention
to
various
benefits,
which
the
company
had
to
given
to
the
employees
in
the
past
when
there
was
no
union
in
the
picture,
and
he
urged
the
employees,
he
urged
the
employees
to
vote
--
to
vote
because
as
he
quoted,
the
issue
before
them
was
whether
they
were
going
to
retain
the
right
--
their
right
to
speak
and
act
for
themselves
or
whether
they
wanted
to
surrender
that
right
to
the
union.
on
march
4,
on
march
4,
two
weeks
before
the
election
which
had
been
ordered
by
the
board,
the
company
sent
to
its
employees
a
letter
together
with
a
pamphlet
and
a
cartoon.
and
in
this
--
in
this
communication,
the
company
announced
two
changes
in
the
employment
conditions
which
would
benefit
the
employees.
and
these
two
changes
are
the
subject
matter
of
this
litigation.
now,
before
i
describe,
before
i
describe
these
two
changes,
which
the
company
made
in
the
employees
--
in
the
employees'
employment
conditions,
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
take
note
of
the
context
in
which
these
benefits
were
announced
by
the
company.
the
letter,
the
pamphlet
and
the
cartoon
to
which
i
have
made
reference
are
reprinted
at
pages
90
to
97
of
the
record.
and
the
opening
paragraphs,
the
opening
paragraphs
of
the
company's
letter
of
march
4th,
i
think,
are
fairly
indicative
of
the
tenure
of
the
entire
letter.
but
i
doubt
if
i
can
do
justice
of
the
company's
stylistic
bait
and
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
take
a
moment
of
the
court's
time
and
read
these
opening
paragraphs.
the
letter
said,
“to
our
fellow
employees,
you've
got
an
envelope
from
us
through
the
mail
yesterday
an
empty
envelope.
you
may
have
thought
that
we
goofed,
that
we
forgot
to
put
something
in
it.
but
we
didn't
forget,
we
didn't
intend
to
put
anything
in
it.
that
empty
envelope
had
everything
that
the
boilermakers
have
done
for
you
and
everything
it
can
do
for
you.
that
empty
envelope
brought
home
to
you
the
empty
promises
of
the
union
and
the
fact
that
it
is
the
company
that
puts
things
in
your
envelope.
your
paycheck,
your
vacation
pay,
your
holiday
pay,
your
insurance,
etcetera.
the
union
can't
put
any
of
those
things
in
your
envelope,
only
the
company
can
do
that.”
and
then,
the
third
whole
--
opening
paragraph,
“those
of
you
who
have
been
with
us
for
some
time,
know
the
improvements
had
been
made
in
your
job,
the
benefits
should
now
enjoy
employees
that
make
your
job
a
good
job.”
the
fact
that
it
didn't
take
the
union
to
get
any
of
those
things
and
that
it
won't
take
a
union
to
get
additional
improvements
in
the
future.
now,
the
pamphlet
then
went
on
to
say
how
well
the
employees
at
fair
in
the
past
without
the
benefit
of
the
union.
and
it
listed
numerous
benefits.
it
listed
numerous
benefits
which
the
company
had
given
to
the
employees
from
1949
to
1960
including
the
two
benefits
which
they
say
are
the
subject
matter
of
this
--
of
this
litigation
here.
and
finally,
the
--
the
pamphlet
found
up
on
page
96
with
a
preemptory
"vote
no,
grow
with
(inaudible)."
and
then,
there
was
attached
to
the
pamphlet
a
cartoon,
which
i
think
which
is
reproduced
at
page
97,
and
the
cartoon
very
dramatically
and
graphically
illustrates,
i
think,
the
entire
thrust
of
the
message.
that
cartoon
said,
“when
all
the
shouting
is
done,
remember,
it's
the
company
that
has
the
jobs
and
pays
the
money,
not
the
union.”
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
not
at
all.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
none
at
all.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
correct.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
correct.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
would
doubt
it
very
much
that
the
court
would
want
to
do
so.
now,
as
i
said
it
was
in
this
context
and
that
the
two
changes,
the
two
changes
in
the
employers'
working
additions
were
made.
now,
these
two
changes,
these
two
changes,
one
dealt
with
the
computation
of
overtime
pay
and
the
other
dealt
with
vacations.
now,
prior
to
the
announcement
that
was
made
of
the
change
by
the
company,
the
company,
in
computing
overtime
pay,
had
not
treated
a
working
holiday
--
a
paid
holiday,
had
not
treated
a
paid
holiday
as
working
time
for
the
purpose
of
computing
overtime.
now,
under
the
new
plan,
which
the
company
announced
two
weeks
before
this
election
was
be
held
by
the
board,
under
this
new
plan,
a
working
holiday
would
be
counted,
a
working
holiday
would
be
counted
for
purposes
of
computing
the
overtime
pay
if
the
employee
worked
the
day
before
and
the
day
after
the
working
holiday,
and
this
meant
as
the
company's
communication
stated
to
the
employees
that
the
employees
would
receive
an
additional
$5
to
$6
extra
compensation
for
any
week
in
which
there
was
a
paid
holiday.
and
the
company,
at
this
time,
had
approximately
six
paid
holidays
for
the
year.
now,
the
other
change,
the
other
benefit,
the
other
benefit,
which
the
company
announced
as
i
said,
had
to
do
with
vacations.
prior
to
this
announcement,
the
employees'
vacation
--
paid
vacation
leave
would
start
on
a
friday
and
end
on
the
thursday
of
the
following
week.
so
there
was
only
one
weekend
intervening
during
that
--
during
that
period.
under
the
new
plan,
under
the
new
plan
that
company
in
effect
increased
the
vacation
from
seven
--
from
seven
to
--
to
eight
and
a
half
days.
under
the
new
plan,
the
employee
could
start
--
would
quit
work
at
saturday
noon,
his
vacation
would
begin
on
the
following
monday
and
then
he
wouldn't
have
to
return
until
a
week
from
that
monday.
so
the
result
of
this
change,
although
there
--
the
company
did
not
pay
any
more
than
--
paid
previously
that
many
for
one
week,
the
result
of
this
change
was
that
the
employee
got
an
additional
one-half
days
vacation,
two
weekends
in
fact
instead
of
one.
and
as
the
court
below
noted,
this
was
a
substantial
fringe
benefit
to
the
employees.
now,
the
election
was
held
as
scheduled
and
the
union
lost
the
election
by
a
vote
of
121
to
94.
now,
as
i
--
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
has
indicated,
both
the
board
and
the
court
below
agree
that
these
benefits
were
made
by
the
employer
that
they
were
introduced
for
the
purpose,
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
the
employees
to
reject
the
union.
the
board
held
that
in
view
of
their
timing
and
their
motivation
that
these
--
that
the
introduction
of
these
benefits
constituted
the
illegal
interference
and
restraint
on
coercion
with
the
employees
right
to
engage
in
self-organization
and
their
right
to
select
bargaining
representatives
of
their
own
choosing.
the
court
below
on
the
other
hand
although
agreeing
that
the
--
the
board
as
for
the
purpose
of
the
employer
had
in
introducing
the
benefits,
nevertheless,
concluded
that
since
the
benefits
were
put
into
effect
unconditionally
and
without
any
strings
attached,
any
visible
strings,
without
any
visible
strings
attached,
that
this
constituted
a
form
of
legitimate
persuasion
rather
an
illegal
interference
or
restraint.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
we
think
it
has
a
good
deal
to
do
it.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
other
is
a
very
good
language,
yes,
that's
right.
the
--
now,
as
i've
said
the
court
below
thought
that
this
was
a
form
of
legitimate
persuasion
rather
than
illegal
interference.
we
think
the
court
was
wrong
in
arriving
at
this
conclusion.
and
well,
it
might
be
said
that
money
does
talk,
that
it
does
more
than
merely
persuade.
we
think
that
it
restraints
and
coerces
the
employees'
judgment.
now,
one
of
the
principle
cornerstones
of
our
national
labor
relations
policy
is
embodied
in
the
act
is
the
right
of
the
employees
to
engage
in
self-organization
and
to
select
bargaining
representatives
of
their
own
choosing.
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
act,
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
act
seeks
to
implement
this
guarantee.
and
as
this
court
long
ago
confirmed
in
the
republic
aviation
case,
its
dominant
purposes
to
protect
the
exercise
of
this
right
against
employer
interference,
restraint
or
coercion.
now,
an
employer
may
impair
that
freedom,
impair
those
rights,
impair
those
rights
either
through
favors
or
through
reprisals.
as
the
seventh
circuit
once
putted
in
fairly
classic
form,
interference
has
no
less
interference
because
it
is
accomplished
through
allureness
rather
than
through
coercion.
now,
we
are
all
agreed,
we
are
all
agreed
that
if
an
employer
expressly
conditions,
expressly
conditions
benefits
to
employees
upon
their
refraining
from
engaging
in
concerted
activities
or
the
--
from
their
refraining
from
joining
a
union
or
repudiating
a
union
that
if
he
so
conditions
these
benefits,
that
this
is
a
clear
invasion,
an
illegal
invasion
of
their
statutory
right.
as
this
court
said
in
the
medo
photo
case
a
number
of
years
ago,
that
could
be
no
--
this
is
--
there
could
be
no
more
obvious
way
of
interfering
with
the
employees'
rights
because
the
employer's
action
is
put
the
employees
in
an
economic
squeeze
and
the
freedom
which
he
acts
seeks
to
extend
to
the
employees
would
be
illusory
indeed
if
the
employer
could
condition
the
exercise
upon
rewards
or
punishment.
now,
the
court
below,
of
course,
if
we
would
--
with
the
position
of
this
court
in
medo
photo,
but
it
thought
there
was
a
difference
into
this
case
because
the
employer,
in
granting
the
benefits,
all
the
way
granted
them
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
this
--
them
to
reject
the
union,
nevertheless,
since
the
benefits
had
been
granted
unconditionally
and
without
any
strings
attached
that
such
benefits
could
not
influence
the
employees'
judgment
with
respect
to
either
job
tenure
or
compensation.
now,
we
submit
that
in
taking
this
position,
the
court
below,
the
court
below
has
misconceived
the
broad
base
upon
which
cases,
like
medo
photo,
are
rest.
now,
the
underlie
--
the
thesis
--
the
underlying
thesis
of
cases
like
medo
photo
and
they
are
many
of
them
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
underlying
thesis
in
that
case
is
not
merely
that
an
employer
violates
the
act
when
he
insist
upon,
when
he
expressly
insist
upon
a
quid
pro
quo
for
the
benefits.
the
(inaudible)
thrust,
the
bar
thrust
of
those
cases
is
that
the
act
bars
an
employer
from
using
his
econ
--
the
economic
power
which
he
alone
has
all
that
the
employees
in
order
to
influence
their
judgment
and
to
induce
them
to
adjure
--
to
refrain
from
engaging
in
--
in
concerted
activities
or
to
reject
the
union
because
the
announcement
of
the
benefits
by
an
employer
at
a
time
when
it's
critical
time
in
a
union's
organizing
efforts
or
before
a
board
election.
and
where
it's
apparent
as
it
was
in
this
case
that
the
employer's
purpose,
that
the
employer's
purpose
is
to
induce
them
to
reject
the
union
in
that
kind
of
a
setting
dealing
introduction
of
such
benefits
necessarily
we
asserting,
necessarily
carries
in
the
eyes
of
the
employees
either
the
threat,
either
the
threat
that
these
benefits
will
be
withdrawn
if
they
fail
to
exceed
to
their
--
their
employer's
manifest
desires
and
wishes
or
that
if
they
do
comply
with
those
manifest
desires
and
wishes
and
reject
the
union
that
they
will
retain
them
and
perhaps
that
it
maybe
even
more
coming
in
the
future.
an
employer
would
--
we
believe,
would
have
to
be
obtuse
indeed
not
to
anticipate.
it
appears
in
the
pressures
which
his
action
in
these
circumstances
here
would
engender
the
minds
of
the
employees.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
we
do
--
no,
well,
no.
no,
we're
not
suggesting
that
but
we
do
--
well,
our
position
here
is
that
when
an
employer,
when
an
employer
puts
into
effect
benefits
here
for
the
purpose,
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
we
would.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
--
it's
true.
but
i
don't
think
we
can
ignore
all
the
--
i
--
i
don't
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
sorry?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
isn't
this
case
to
begin
with
because
here,
it
was
fairly
evident,
it
fairly
evident
what
the
employer
was
trying
to
do
when
he
introduced
these
benefits
at
least
on
the
finding
has
made
by
the
board
and
confirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
these
benefits
were
introduced
at
this
time
solely
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
these
employees
to
eject
the
union,
and
it
was
apparent
to
the
employees.
it
was
apparent
to
the
employees
that
this
was
the
employer's
motive
because
at
the
--
both
--
at
the
company
sponsor
dinner
of
february
25th,
the
employer
had
sought
--
had
talked
to
the
employees
to
induce
them
to
reject
the
union.
and
indeed,
these
benefits
were
made
in
the
context
of
the
letter,
which
i
have
called
to
the
court's
attention,
which
the
employer
is
inviting
employees.
almost
in
preemptory
fashion
you
might
say
commanding
them,
commanding
them
to
vote
against
the
union.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
from
the
very
fact?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
took
these
matters
into
consideration.
the
trial
examiner
took
these
matters
into
consideration.
he
was
affirmed
by
the
board
in
a
short
form
decision.
and
on
the
basis
of
this
entire
picture
here,
the
trial
examiner
where
the
courts
--
where
the
board
and
the
court
approved
or
concluded
that
this
was
the
purpose
of
inducing
these
employees
to
eject
the
union.
and
as
i
say,
the
introduction
of
such
benefits,
even
though
there
are
no
strings
attached,
even
though
there
are
no
conditions,
that
necessarily
creates
in
the
employees'
mind
fears
and
pressures
that
they
will
either
be
able
retain
the
benefits
only
if
they
exceed
to
their
employer's
wishes
or
that
they
will
lose
them
if
they
ignore
those
wishes
and
vote
for
the
union.
the
very
fact
that
the
employer
has
left
the
question
--
these
questions
unanswered
in
the
minds
of
the
employees,
that
very
fact,
it
seems
to
us,
only
serves
to
intensify,
only
serves
to
intensify
the
fears
and
the
pressures
which
the
employers
actually
would
generate
in
the
minds
of
the
employees.
now,
we
believe
that
in
a
setting
of
this
kind,
in
a
setting
of
this
kind,
the
employees
are
very
likely
to
infer
that
the
defeat
of
the
union
will
preserve
the
benefits
which
the
employer
has
given
them
and
that
they
run
the
risk
of
jeopardizing
their
economic
well-being
if
they
ignore
those
expressed
wishes
despite
the
fact,
despite
the
fact
that
the
employer
has
attached
no
conditions
--
no
conditions
to
the
--
to
the
benefits.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
think
the
board
would
have
found
a
violation
on
those
circumstances
where
the
employer
is
primarily
reciting
what
he
has
done
in
the
past.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
(voice
overlap)
the
board
probably
holds
that
such
a
communication
in
and
of
itself
would
probably
be
protected
by
its
seat
and
this
will
get
permissible
--
permissible
expression.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
except
that
in
one
--
in
the
first
instance,
he
is
merely
--
he
is
merely
indicating
to
them
what
the
past
--
what
the
past
has
been.
and
here,
however
though,
where
he,
at
the
very
moment,
on
this
might
say
were
two
weeks,
two
weeks
before
the
election.
he
throws
into
--
he
throws
into
the
scale,
he
throws
into
scale
these
--
these
additional
benefits,
these
additional
benefits,
then
i
think
that
the
employers
under
those
circumstances
may
well
feel,
may
well
feel
that
they
may
lose
those
benefits
if
they
ignore
the
employer's
wishes
or
his
wishes
or
they
may
possibly
even
get
more
if
they
exceeded
those
--
if
they
exceeded
those
--
to
those
wishes.
now,
when
we
think
that
there
really
is
no
meaningful
distinction
between
a
case
of
this
kind
where
there
are
no
strings
express
--
no
--
no
expressed
conditions
attached
to
the
gifts
in
the
case
like
medo
photo
because
in
both
cases,
in
both
cases,
the
employees
--
the
employees
have
a
very
real
fear,
have
a
--
may
have
a
very
--
will
have
a
very
real
fear
that
unless
they
exceed
to
the
employer's
desires,
these
manifest
desires,
that
they
run
their
risk
of
jeopardizing
--
of
jeopardizing
their
--
their
economic
well-being.
and
to
put
it
very
bluntly
--
to
put
it
very
bluntly,
i
think
what
you
have
in
both
cases
is
an
attempt
on
the
party
employer
to
buy
votes,
to
the
--
to
buy
votes.
and
as
the
court
said
in
medo
photo,
it
is
difficult
to
concede
of
a
more
obvious
way
of
interfering
with
the
employees'
freedom
of
choice
which
the
statute
seeks
to
guarantee
to
them.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
they
had
original
and
be
put
in.
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
exactly.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
exactly.
now,
this
does
not
mean,
this
does
not
mean
that
the
board's
position
in
this
case
does
not
mean
that
if
an
employer,
during
the
course
of
a
union's
organizing
campaign,
has
to
freeze
employment
conditions
or
during
the
pendency
of
a
board
election
that
he
has
to
--
that
he
has
to
freeze
employment
conditions.
the
board
has
repeatedly
said
that
the
act
does
not
bar
an
employer
from
making
changes
in
employment
conditions
either
during
the
pendency
--
during
--
during
organizational
campaign
or
during
the
pendency
of
a
board
election.
the
controlling
factor,
the
controlling
factors
intent,
timing
and
intent
motivation.
an
employer
does
have
a
business
to
run
and
the
act
does
not
bar
an
employer
from
making
such
changes
as
legitimate
business
considerations
require
or
--
or
indicate
to
him.
but
where
he
does
that
and
it's
apparent
to
the
employees
that
the
changes
are
being
made
by
their
employer
or
due
to
legitimate
business
considerations
that
--
they're
not
likely
to
infer.
they're
not
likely
to
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
is
--
the
board
and
the
courts
have
held,
your
honor,
that
where
an
employer
has
two
motives,
two
-
two
intents,
a
good
and
a
bad
one,
he's
stuck
with
the
bad
one.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
i'm
--
it
puzzled
me
too.
i
haven't
been
quite
sure.
apparently,
they
think
that
the
objective
evidence
that
when
there
is
a
condition,
when
the
employer
expressly
conditions
his
gift
upon
the
employees
rejecting
the
union
that
this
--
this
is
objective
taint.
but
when
there
is
no
such
condition,
there
is
no
objective
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
didn't
have
to
prove
what,
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
think
it
suggest
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
--
what
the
employer
succeeds
or
doesn't
succeed
as
we've
often
said
with
respect
to
numerous
types
of
unfair
labor
practices
is
relevant.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir,
i
can
only
say
i
join
in
your
--
in
your
wonders
what
the
court
meant.
i'm
not
sure
what
--what
is
precisely
meant
there.
but
it
seems
like
the
heart
of
its
--
the
heart
of
its
position
is,
that
is
on
page
127,
that
where
the
court
says
here,
"the
benefits
were
put
into
effect
unconditionally
on
a
permanent
basis
and
no
one
suggest
there
was
any
implication
that
benefits
would
be
withdrawn.
if
the
work
is
voted
for
the
unions,
the
employees
were
as
free
after
the
establishment
of
the
new
benefits
as
they
were
beforehand
to
vote
for
or
against
the
union
according
to
their
own
wishes
untrammelled
by
considerations
of
the
impact
your
decision
would
have
on
their
job
security,
compensation
or
relations
with
the
employer.
and
as
i
said
earlier
in
the
argument,
i
think
that
the
court
has
--
has
misconceived
not
only
the
basis
upon
which
the
medo
photo
case
rest,
that
once
the
employer
throws
into
the
scales,
his
economic
way
even
though
he
has
not
said
to
the
employees
"in
terms,
you'll
be
punished
if
you
don't
follow
me,
if
you
don't
exceed
to
my
manifest
desires."
once
he
has
thrown
that
into
the
scales,
they're
inevitably
the
employees'
judgment
will
be
trampled
by
considerations
of
job
compensation
and
job
--
and
job
security.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
cuts
--
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
bargaining
representative
in
this
case.
the
union
--
there
was
pending
an
election
so
we
don't
have
the
--
you
are
allowed
election
on
the
part
of
an
employer,
on
the
part
of
an
employer
in
this
regard.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
8
(a)
(5).
and
of
course,
in
medo
photo
in
which
where
i'm
placing
considerable
reliance,
in
medo
photo,
you
had
an
employer
there
who
--
who
told
the
employees,
"if
you
get
rid
of
the
union,"
there
was
a
bargaining
representative
there,
"if
you
get
rid
of
the
union,
i
will
increase
your
wages."
but
this
court
found
not
only
the
employer
violate
8
(a)
(5)
by
dealing
directly
with
the
employees
but
it
also
found
an
independent
8
(a)
(1),
8
(a)
(1)
and
saying
the
language,
which
i
quoted
a
moment
ago,
there
could
be
no
more
obvious
way
for
an
employer
interfere
with
his
employees'
rights
by
seeking
to
persuade
them
to
reject
the
union
or
abandon
the
union
by
offering
them
--
by
offering
them
increase
wages.
now,
the
further
argument
that
has
been
made
in
connection
with
this
type
of
case
and
that
is
that
--
that
surely,
an
employer
doesn't
have
to
stand
still
when
the
union
is
trying
to
organize
employees,
and
so
what's
wrong
if
he
tries
to
meet
the
union
by
giving
them
the
employees'
benefits
for
the
very
purpose
of
beating
the
union.
but
i
suggest,
your
honor,
that
the
argument
is
really
wide
of
the
mark.
it's
not
really
a
question
of
whether
or
not
it's
going
to
be
easy
or
tough
for
a
union.
the
question
that
we
have,
the
question
that
we
have
whether
--
whether
the
--
an
employer's
use
of
the
economic
power,
which
he
alone
has
over
the
employees,
for
the
purpose,
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
them
to
reject
the
union
whether
that
kind
of
an
action
in
the
part
of
the
employer
is
incompatible,
is
incompatible
with
their
freedom
of
choice
that
the
statutes
seeks
to
guarantee.
and
we
submit
that
it
is,
that
congress
meant
to
preclude,
that
congress
meant
to
preclude
an
employer
from
using
that
power,
which
i
say
which
he
alone
has,
to
influence
the
judgment
because,
as
i've
said
and
i
will
close
on
this
note,
there
could
be
no
more
obvious
way
of
restraining
the
employees
from
the
exercise
of
their
freedom.
