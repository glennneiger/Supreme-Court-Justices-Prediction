now,
in
this
communications,
which
you
told
us
about
at
the
onset
of
the
argument,
there
was
a
long
review
of
previous
benefits
--

stewart
--
had
been
given
over
the
years
voluntarily
by
the
employer
that
is
that
no
union
that
use
--
makes
the
point
they
voluntary,
if
--
if
this
case
involved
just
that
kind
of
review,
if
this
case
involve
everything
that
you
now
have
except
for
the
two
benefits
given
contemporaneously,
would
you
--
would
you
have
a
violation
of
the
act?

and
strongly
expressing
his
view
to

not
for
the

for
the
union.

although
presumably,
in
the
absence
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
if
--
if
benefits
have
been
voluntarily
conferred,
they
could've
been
voluntarily
withdraw
could
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
therefore
wouldn't
the
same
argument
that
you're
now
making
would
be
applicable?
justice
potter
stewart
that
--
that
kind
of
thing
that's
expressly
covered
by

isn't
it?
