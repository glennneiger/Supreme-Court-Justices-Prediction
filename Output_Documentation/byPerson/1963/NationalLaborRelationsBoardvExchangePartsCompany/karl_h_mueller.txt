mr.
karl
h.
mueller
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
one
may
be
given
to
wonder,
i
think,
how
it
is
that
it
took
more
than
25
years
for
this
question
to
reach
this
court.
i
think
the
answer
lies
in
the
fact
that
while
it
penetrates
to
the
very
roots
of
the
act,
the
cut
is
very
narrow.
we
think
that
is
because
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
bring
the
question
to
a
very
sharp
point.
we
found
no
case
like
this
one
and
neither
did
the
court
of
appeals.
i
suppose
all
of
us
would
be
reluctant
to
say
there
is
no
case
but
certainly,
we
are
unable
to
find
it.
and
that
probably
accounts
for
the
fact
that
we're
here
today.
this
case
is
readily
distinguished,
we
think,
from
the
cases
that
have
involved
the
conferring
of
economic
benefits
on
employees
in
the
context
of
a
pending
representation
of
the
case.
counsels
made
repeated
reference
to
medo.
and
medo
is
pulls
apart
from
this
case
as
we
view
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
i
thought
that
medo
was
even
within
citing
distance
of
this
case,
i
wouldn't
presume
on
the
court
to
be
here.
and
i
think
that
if
i
may
be
bold
enough
to
suggest
an
answer
to
the
question,
"what
did
the
fifth
circuit
have
in
mind
when
it
talked
in
terms
of
objective
evidence?"
i
think
it
was
talking
in
those
terms
has
confer
distinguish
which
from
subjective.
and
my
own
(inaudible)
way
--
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
yes.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
yes.
this
--
this,
to
me,
is
quite
simple.
and
--
and
this
may
be
a
case
of
ignorance
being
blitz.
on
--
subjective
as
i
understand
it,
as
judge
wisdom
used
it
and
i
started
thinking
it
should
be
used
in
this
case,
was
the
employer's
state
of
mind
something
that
would
require
omissions
to
fair
it
out
absent
and
objective
expression
of
that
subject
you
state.
that
sounds
rather
involved
and
pre-profound.
i
hope
i
know
what
it
means,
i
think
i
do.
i
think
that
the
thing
becomes
objective.
here
is
your
intent
locked
within
the
mind
of
the
one
whose
conduct
is
under
scrutiny.
unless
he
errs
expression
to
it,
it's
never
known.
it
maybe
inferred,
it
can
be
confessed.
but
it
becomes
known,
i
think,
when
that
intent
takes
objective
form.
and
to
me
it
did
that
in
medo.
one
would
assume
that
the
employer
in
that
case
had
in
mind
to
buy
the
employees
out
of
voting
for
the
union.
such
was
his
intent
but
it
didn't
remain
locked
in
his
mind
as
we
think
ours
did
in
our
mind.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
i
think
i
could,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
but
i
don't
think
i'm
in
position
to
do
it
at
this
stage
of
the
case.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
yes.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
yes.
and
i
wouldn't
want
to
quibble
or
dodge
the
matter.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
the
thing
that
i
come
to,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
exactly.
and
--
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
persuade.
precisely.
i
think
your
honors
come
--
come
right
to
the
--
to
the
crux
of
the
thing.
the
only
objective
evidence
that
thing
which
was
brought
to
the
employees'
attention
that
might
affect
them
and
dispose
to
them,
our
subjective
intent
is
not
attacked
in
this
case.
counsels
made
reference
to
the
little
letter
that
we
wrote.
it
was
a
piece
of
literature
designed
to
sell.
it
must
have
been
recognized
by
the
board
as
coming
within
the
limits
of
permissible,
not
only
permissible
but
protected
free
speech
under
8
(c).
no
findings
have
been
made
of
what
we
said
went
beyond
the
bounds
of
propriety.
and
we
assume,
we
hope
rightly
so
that
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended,
it
is
not
unlawful
for
an
employer
to
express
opposition
to
a
union.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
it's
--
yes.
and
that's
all
we
did.
and
the
board
has
not
said
otherwise.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
oh,
i'll
come
to
those.
i'm
talking
about
free
speech
now,
if
your
honor
please.
i'm
talking
about
the
pamphlets,
the
cartoon
are
importuning.
that
was
simply
the
other
side
of
the
street
in
this
selling
campaign
with
the
union
trying
to
sell
the
employees
on
the
benefits
it
claimed
it
could
get
for
them.
we
try
to
sell
among
the
fact
that
didn't
need
a
union
to
get
good
things.
they
hadn't
needed
one
in
the
past
and
didn't
need
one
now.
now,
we
think
you've
got
to
accept
--
i
should
put
it
in
that
way,
excuse
me.
i
think
one
must
accept
the
fact
that
what
we
said
to
the
employees,
what
we
communicated
to
the
employees,
laying
to
one
side
for
a
moment,
these
two
benefits
was
not
unlawful,
hasn't
been
found
to
be
unlawful
so
--
that
this
case
comes
to
the
court
--
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
8
(c),
yes.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
we
think
that's
exactly
right.
and
we
think
this,
we
think
that
the
board
has
undertaken
to
--
to
find
us
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
because
of
the
lawful
exercise
of
our
right
of
free
speech.
and
we
say,
i
hope
you
pardon
me
for
the
way
in
which
i
put
it
but
i
--
i
can't
resist,
that
if
that's
true,
the
right
to
a
free
speech
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
the
hands
of
an
employer
becomes
nothing
more
than
a
license
to
grab
a
wildcat
by
the
tail.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
i'm
coming
to
that.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
this
is
--
this
is
true.but
these
things,
if
your
honor
please,
in
a
context
that
is
as
clean
as
any
case
were
found
--
to
be
found.
in
this
case,
no
threats
of
reprisal,
no
unlawful
promises
of
benefit,
as
we
communicated
with
the
employees,
no
conditions
as
in
medo.
and
as
i
say,
if
we
were
anywhere
close
in
medo,
i
wouldn't
presume
on
the
court's
time.
but
here,
unlike
medo,
we
didn't
say
to
the
employees,
"we're
giving
you
this.
we
hope
you're
grateful.
we're
giving
you
this
if
you'll
stay
out
of
the
union.
we
will
give
you
this
if
you
stay
out
of
the
union."
and
here's
the
difference
that
the
court
of
appeals
saw
and
that
i've
seen
all
the
time
and
i
hope
were
both
right.
there's
a
vast
difference
between
promising
someone
in
the
context
of
an
election
and
making
an
outright
absolute
unconditional
ground
of
some
benefit.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
oh,
no.
oh,
no,
if
your
honor
please.
these
were
the
things
--
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
--
seizes
to
be
subjective
and
becomes
objective.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
yes,
sir.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
i
hope
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
that.
i
would
want
to.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
yes.
i
can't.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
i
--
i
guess,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
it's
because
--
i
--
i
guess
the
court
being
staff
that
just
man
can't
answer
every
conceivable
question
that
might
arise
in
the
case.
i
think
almost
every
court's
opinion
leaves
some
area
that
one
may
flash
back,
and
i'm
not
suggesting
your
honors
doing
that,
but
there
maybe
an
area
too
which
the
court
didn't
address
itself.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
i'll
be
pleased
to
do
that.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
just
before
we
took
our
recess,
mr.
justice
goldberg
can
be
invited
me
to
direct
my
attention
for
a
moment
to
a
part
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
your
honor,
i
think
you've
indicated
page
127.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
i'm
not
sure
i
have
my
finger
on
the
particular
sentence.
i
suspect
it's
the
one
as
it
not
where
the
court
says
here
the
benefits
were
put
into
effect
unconditionally
on
a
permanent
basis.
and
no
one
has
suggested
that
there
was
any
implication
the
benefits
would
be
withdrawn
if
the
workers
voted
for
the
union.
is
that
the
point?
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
thank
you.
well,
i
don't
mean
to
try
to
over
simplify
the
thing
but
it
poses
no
difficulties
for
me.
i
think
what
the
court
says
is
true.
i
think
the
court
said
what
it
meant.
i
don't
think
that
it
had
in
mind
the
question
that
your
honor
has
suggested
of
what
would
have
been
the
case,
had
the
employer
gone
to
each
employee
and
handed
him
a
package
as
it
were
saying
to
him
along
with
the
gift,
"please
vote
against
the
union
or
vote
for
me."
i
just
don't
think
that
--
that
occurred
to
--
to
judge
wisdom.
i
would
hesitate
to
assume
the
role
of
a
prophet.
i
know
so
far
as
i'm
personally
concern,
i
think
to
do
that
would
be
to
violate
the
law.
i
really
don't
have
any
question
about
it.
there
--
there
you
would
have
an
objective
tie
between
the
gift
and
the
expressed
wish
of
the
giver
or
grantor.
and
--
and
i
don't
think
that,
for
whatever
it's
worth,
i
don't
think
that
i
would
want
to
assume
the
burden
of
establishing
an
employer's
right
to
hand
an
employee
a
$10
bill
and
say,
"here
joe,
this
is
all
yours.
i
hope
you
stick
with
me
or
i
hope
you'll
vote
against
the
union".
i
think
you
have
a
coupling
there.
i
think
there
you
have
a
case
of
economic
power
born
of
the
desperation
of
the
moment
calculated
the
influence
and
interfere
with
notwithstanding
its
--
its
unconditional.
i
think
that
their
implication
is
that
go
with
it
in
those
circumstances
that
would
condemn,
certainly
it
would
in
my
mind.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
yes,
it
did
not
--
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
it
is
distorted,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
yes.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
yes.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
yes.
i
think
one
has
to
view
the
thing
in
context
just
as
i
would
suggest
this
language
has
been
referred
to
as
good
in
an
area
resist
or
can't
be
considered
outside
the
factual
situation
in
that
case
out
of
context
when
we
begun
lifting
choice
passages
and
separating
them
from
context,
i
think
we
can
be
let
off
into
--
by
wilderness.
in
this
situation,
i
--
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
if
i
may
and
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
your
question
invites
that
and
i
don't
mean
to
go
to
feel
about
it.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
well,
i'm
not
sure.
i
think
that
gets
pretty
close.
i
think
that
it
readily
of
course
distinguishable
as
your
honor
had
in
mind
to
do
from
the
employer
handed
somebody
a
$10
bill
and
say,
"here
it
is."
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
now,
i
think
that
--
if
on
--
on
march
4,
we
had
said
we
are
announcing
additional
benefits
and
suggesting
in
consideration
of
this
additional
grant,
we
appeal
to
you
to
vote
against
the
union.
i
--
i
wouldn't
do
that.
i
--
i
think
that
would
be
getting
across
the
line.
i
think
it
would
be
a
transgression
we
need
do.
i
think
there
--
there
he
get
away
from
--
from
the
persuasion,
effective
persuasion
at
free
speech
for
this.
and
--
and
you
get
over
into
an
area
that
may
apply
what
the
court
referred
to
and
i
think
maybe
judge
wisdom
was
borrowing
from
words
of
this
court,
puts
the
employees
in
a
squeeze.
out
of
which
comes
interference
or
which
constitutes
interference,
restraint
or
coercion.
where
the
employee
actually
feels
that
he
is
faced
with
the
necessity
of
deciding
to
exercise
his
rights
freely
under
the
act
as
he
wishes
to
do
on
the
one
hand
or
refraining
from
doing
that
because
of
a
fear
that
he
will
offend
his
employer
and
may
have
injure
himself.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
i
--
i
don't
think,
to
my
way
of
thinking
if
i
may
say
so.
ingratitude
is
one
of
the
great
sense,
if
not
the
chief
one.
i
don't
think
that
for
an
employee
to
say
that
my
boss
has
been
good
to
me.
and
times
pass,
he
didn't
want
this.
i'm
not
going
to
vote
for
him.
now,
that's
--
that's
what
happens
in
these
things.
that's
what
the
employer's
campaign
is.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
oh,
yes.
the
timing
has
--
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
no.
it
--
and
--
and
i
hope
it
would
not
be
one
of
those
things
that
would
fall
in
the
area
of
a
forbidden
promise
that
would
appeal
to
a
man's
cupidity
and
destroy
his
free
agency.
the
court
below
found
that
after
these
things
were
done,
the
employees
were
as
free
as
they
have
been
before.
i
barely
believe
that
to
be
true.
and
i
think
it's
true
from
the
facts
of
the
case.
here's
what
we
find
actually.
i
think
when
you
examine,
the
trial
examiners
have
immediate
report
and
the
board
simply
adopted
it.
when
they
talk
about
what
the
board
found,
the
board
didn't
find
anything
except
that
it
was
going
to
swallow
whole
what
the
trial
examiner
had
said
out.
and
i'd
like
to
come
to
that
for
a
moment
here.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
this
--
this
is
precisely
--
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
--
the
thing
that
i
proposed
to
do
--
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
--
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
in
so
doing
may
i
simply
observe,
as
a
preliminary
thing,
that
one
will
find
a
sharp
difference
between
what
the
board
said
indeed
in
its
decision
by
adopting
what
the
trial
examiner
said
and
did,
and
what
the
board
talks
about
in
its
brief.
to
me,
it's
hard
to
recognize
the
two
as
being
the
same
case.
in
our
situation
here,
to
set
this
thing
in
context,
here's
what
happen.
year
after
year,
as
this
small
outfit
grew,
it
made
the
improvements
in
the
working
conditions
of
the
employees
in
the
terms
of
their
employment.
i'll
be
the
last
to
say
that
in
the
inner
recesses
of
the
minds
of
management,
there
was
not
the
whole.
and
the
purpose,
perhaps,
that
the
employees
would
be
grateful,
as
has
been
suggested,
and
that
because
of
the
--
the
employer
taking
care
of
them
before
he
was
made
to
do
so
by
an
organized
move,
the
employees
would
feel
that
there's
no
need
for
any
outside
help
in
dealing
with
my
boss.
my
boss
is
going
to
do
the
right
thing.
he's
going
to
improve
things
as
rapidly
as
he
can.
nothing
is
wrong
with
that.
i
--
i
don't
think
that
the
access
that
an
employer
is
no
good
unless
his
employees
are
organized.
and
i
don't
think
it
says
either
that
unorganized
employees
are
like
mice
standing
around
in
timorous
fashion
under
the
blacksnake
quip
of
an
employer
that
with
--
being
economic
pressure,
economic
force
or
power
here.
a
few
days
before
the
union
decided
to
try
to
organize
this
plan,
this
is
a
thing
that
came
from
without
not
from
within,
the
employees
didn't
move
for
organization.
the
boilermakers
one
fine
day
said
"we're
going
to
try
to
organize
that
plan."
the
record
is
as
clear
as
crystal
on
this.
a
few
days
before
that
and
with
no
notice
at
all
that
the
boilermakers
were
about
to
take
picks
on
us
as
it
were,
our
management
had
been
to
a
trade
meeting
in
district
convention.
and
the
theme
of
that
meeting
was
employee
welfare
and
they
apparently
attended
the
meetings
and
came
home
imbued
with
the
idea
of
--
of
devoting
their
attention
to
that
very
thing,
seeing
what
they
could
do
to
make
things
better
for
the
employees.
meetings
were
held
on
the
4th
and
5th
of
november.
it
was
at
that
time
that
the
holiday,
the
added
holiday
was
announced
in
keeping
with
the
policy
that
had
been
set
in
1951
--
1955
to
add
one
each
year
until
further
notice.
the
board
condemned
this
on
a
holiday
and
the
fifth
circuit
knocked
him
out
on
that
and
we're
not
here
on
that
point.
but
that
holiday
was
announced.
here
was
a
benefit
right
on
the
eve
unknowing
that
the
union
was
around
the
corner
but
on
the
eve
anyway
of
the
union
presenting
itself,
making
its
entrance
on
the
scene,
along
with
that,
talked
about
a
lot
of
other
things,
reviewed
with
the
employees
and
the
record
shows
all
these.
all
of
the
evidences
are
past
acts
on
our
part
of
interest
in
the
welfare
of
the
employees
and
our
desire
to
do
well
by
then.
added
to
it,
the
holiday
indicated
the
following
saturday,
we
were
going
to
meet
with
the
representatives
of
departments
in
the
factory
to
work
further
on
the
inauguration
of
a
wage
incentive
plan.
of
course,
wage
incentive
plan
went
by
the
boards.
and
then
came
the
union,
asserted
the
naked
claim,
filed
a
petition
in
something
that
we
think
you
can't
overlook
or
that
should
not
be
overlooked.
forgive
me
for
putting
it
that
way.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
yes,
you
do,
30%,
as
i
recall,
the
rule
of
thumbs
sometimes
used
and
sometimes
not
that
what
happened
here
i
don't
know.
but
it
was
a
naked
claim
that
we
claim
the
right
to
represent.
and
the
filing
of
that
petition
set
a
period
that
lasted
for
16
long
months
before
the
petition
was
withdrawn
in
march
of
1961.
16
long
months,
we
were
--
what
should
i
say,
in
this
suspect
category
because
of
the
fact
that
the
union
had
indicated
its
determination
to
try
to
organize
us.
it
seems
to
us,
i
don't
want
to
take
a
greater
burden
on
the
case
imposes
but
it
seems
to
us
in
that
connection
that
the
board
said
that
the
employee
should
be
deprived
of
anything
that
we
wanted
to
give
him
unconditionally
until
that
petition
was
settled
one
way
or
the
other
for
16
months.
this
course
of
conduct
of
making
improvements
year
by
year
was
arrested,
hold
and
stocked,
shuffled
and
would
remain
so
for
16
months.
we
couldn't
give
anything.
the
employees
couldn't
have
anything
because
the
union
ordered
them
and
the
union
was
trying
to
sell
them.
we
don't
think
that's
what
the
extents
for
but
anyway,
here's
what
we
did.
the
record
shows
that
we
had
a
payroll
period
that
ended
on
thursday
and
we
paid
on
friday
each
week.
our
plant
had
grown
to
such
an
extent.
the
accounting
department
couldn't
close
the
payroll
one
night
and
make
the
checks
the
next
morning
so
we
were
faced
with
the
fact,
this
is
in
the
record,
i
happen
to
be
there,
which
adds
nothing
to
it.
and
the
question
was,
we've
got
to
give
the
accounting
department
more
time.
we
got
to
roll
the
payroll
week
back
to
end
on
wednesday
and
still
pay
on
friday.
that
then
left
the
way
in
which
we
have
been
scheduling
vacations
beginning
on
friday
and
in
the
following
thursday
not
to
coincide
with
anything,
and
the
question
was,
shall
we
will
leave
it
hanging?
should
we
move
it
back?
some
change
has
to
be
made
that
no
longer
bears
any
relationship
to
anything.
and
i
made
the
suggestion,
i
think
the
record
indicates
it
but
that
still
doesn't
make
it
any
better
than
someone
else
has
made
it.
i
made
the
suggestion
that
start
on
monday.
and
we
gave
them
exactly
the
same
length
of
vacation,
exactly
the
same
vacation
pay.
and
we
thought
that
it
was
not
actually
an
economic
benefit
but
judge
brown
suggested
that
they
were
fishermen
that
might
have
an
extra
weekend.
but
the
day
and
a
half
to
which
counsel
alludes
from
saturday
noon
until
monday
next,
was
there
a
normal
regular
time
off
not
--
admittedly,
they
could
couple
that
with
their
vacation.
i
believe
its
saturday
noon
and
not
come
back
until
the
second
monday.
so
that
put
their
normal
time
off
at
both
ends
of
their
vacation
period.
this
was
the
first
of
january.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
well
--
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
--
we
made
it
about
the
first
of
--
of
january
but
long
before
we
knew
anything
about
the
board's
decision
long
before
we
knew
about
(voice
overlap)--
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
excuse
me.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
on
the
payroll?
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
and
--
and
the
scheduling
of
vacation
--
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
--
as
the
convention
was
--
was
the
last
part
of
october,
if
your
honor
please.
we
met
and
gave
the
holiday
on
the
4th
and
5th
of
november.
the
union
put
us
on
notice
about
10th.
they
filed
the
petition
about
the
16th.
this
was
the
end
of
december
effective
january
1.
the
overtime
change
was
the
one
that
we
had
put
into
effect
the
preceding
july
and
simply
reinstituted.
and
people
were
taking
vacations
incidentally
under
the
new
plan,
scheduling
vacations
prior
the
time
the
board
order
came
out.
the
timing
we
think
is
right,
right
important.
now,
we
did
mention
it
as
something
that
had
been
done
in
our
march
communication.
well,
here's
some
--
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
no,
i
--
i
won't
try
to
go
behind.
i
was
trying
as
best
i
could
to
answer
the
question
mr.
chief
justice
had
put
in
--
in
connection
with
the
timing
of
these
things
and
the
context
in
which
they
took
place.
they
didn't
take
place,
i
think
as
you
suggested,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may
say
so.
and
i
try
to
indicate
we're
in
the
different
play.
here's
something
that
we
think
needs
to
be
looked
at.
we
talked
a
lot
about
purpose
but
if
you
look
at
the
decision
of
the
trial
examiner,
you'll
find
that
he
said
motivation
is
not
only
not
controlling,
it's
not
even
a
theory.
and
that's
precisely
where
this
thing
set.
and
this
order
of
the
board
didn't
say,
"you
shall
not
grant
economic
benefits
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
or
affecting."
it
says
blanket
on
order
as
one
can
find.
granting
economic
benefits,
not
limited
as
to
purpose,
it
just
simply
said
don't
do
anything.
the
man
at
the
union
indicates
that
it
is
going
to
undertake
to
organize
your
employees.
we
think
that
viewed
in
context,
and
i'm
going
to
have
to
leave
the
case
largely
on
brief.
there
so
many
things
we'd
like
to
say
but
we
recognize,
of
course,
the
time
limitation.
we
think
that,
as
we
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
the
board
has
made
its
mistake
by
looking
at
interference
with
the
union.
it
talks
in
terms
of
injury.
our
employees
weren't
injured.
the
union
may
have
been
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
employees
were
rendered
less
susceptible
to
the
blandishments.
and
the
empty
envelope,
if
your
honor
please,
was
in
response
to
the
union's
constant
statement
by
bulletin
to
the
employees,
"if
you
vote
us
in,
we'll
get
you
this,
this
and
this"
on
the
very
eve
of
our
meeting
to
which
counsel
referred
in
march.
the
union
says
"whatever
the
company
gives
you,
we
will
get
you
double
at
the
bargaining
table."
it
was
a
selling
campaign.
we
think
it
has
to
be
viewed
in
that
context.
and
we
don't
think
that
the
act
required
that
we
go
into
the
ring
with
our
hands
tied
behind
us.
and
there's
no
finding
that
we
did
anything
by
way
of
overreaching
free
speech
or
anything
of
the
sort.
there's
no
background
of
unfair
labor
practices.
there
are
no
accompanying
their
unfair
labor
practice
as
we
did
and
i
accept
--
you
have
suggested,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
accept
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
said,
"you
had
in
your
mind
that
this
would
influence
in
effect
the
employees'
right
but
we
never
communicated
it
to
the
employees
in
such
fashion
as
to
constitute
interference,
restraint
or
coercion."
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct.
thank
you
so
much.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
yes.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
it
certainly
did
and
that
finds
expression
in
the
--
in
the
trial
examiner's
report
(voice
overlap)--
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
--
and
there's
nothing
else.
they've
turned
us
out
of
hand
on
that
question,
mr.
justice
white.
we
put
on
our
man
who
made
the
decision.
and
he
testified
that
this
was
because
of
other
considerations
completely
disassociated
with
the
union,
had
no
connection
with
the
union
at
all.
the
testimony,
of
course,
is
uncontradicted.
and
that
was
turned
out
of
hand
by
the
trial
examiner
and
by
the
board
by
saying
that
what
you
intended,
what
you're
motive
and
purpose
was,
is
not
only
not
controlling,
it's
not
even
material.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
we
--
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
--
we
think
that's
precisely
right
and
that's
what
i
had
in
mind
when
i
say
that
it's
difficult
for
me
to
recognize
the
brief
and
the
decision
as
going
to
the
same
case.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
yes.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
that's
correct.
i
--
i
don't
know.
i
only
left
to
speculate
why
it
was
that
judge
wisdom,
and
i
was
who
sat
with
him,
overlooked
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
address
itself
to
this
crucial
finding
in
the
decision
itself.
that
motive
is
at
no
consequence
at
all
and
they
--
they
just
simply
throughout
the
undisputed
evidence
with
respect
to
our
own
declaration
of
intent.
i
--
i
sort
of
have
a
feeling,
i
hope
i'll
be
forgiven
this,
but
i
sort
have
a
feeling
that,
i
got
it
from
the
oral
argument
before
the
fifth
circuit,
that
judge
wisdom,
i
saw
expressed
himself
in
the
course
of
the
argument,
that
--
that
this
--
this
is
a
strange
thing.
here,
you
have
no
surrounding
unfair
labor
practices,
no
conditions,
no
law
violations,
no
nothing.
do
you
mean
to
say
to
me?
he
says
the
board's
counsel
that
an
employer's
hands
are
tied,
that
the
employees
have
to
forego
things
that
the
employees
would
like
to
have
and
that
the
employer
will
be
glad
for
them
to
have
simply
because
some
union
has
decided
to
undertake
or
organize
various
employees
in
order
to
make
the
employees
more
susceptible
to
acceptance
of
the
union's
promises
that
if
you'll
come
with
me,
i'll
take
you
to
the
promise
land
to
bring
it
to
you.
i
hope
that
answers
it.
mr.
karl
h.
mueller
and
i
appreciate
the
question.
thank
you.
