mr.
charles
w.
cone
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
if
the
court
please?
the
question
as
arisen
initially
or
at
this
time
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
fraud
in
the
purchase
of
these
bonds
by
angel
yiatchos
at
the
time
of
the
purchase.
we
admit
at
this
time
that
the
record
is
not
complete.
mr.
whitmore
and
i
stipulated
to
all
material
facts
and
there
are
now
facts
that
appear
more
material
than
they
did
in
1959
when
we
so
stipulated.
however,
the
trial
court
made
a
founding
--
a
finding
which
in
a
sense
is
a
finding
that
there
was
fraud.
this
was
an
attempted
gift
by
a
husband
of
what
is
stipulated
to
be
community
property,
and
this
would
be
a
--
a
constructive
fraud
upon
the
wife
if
it
was
done
without
her
consent,
without
her
knowledge,
without
subsequent
ratification
by
her
or
without
consideration
or
benefit
to
the
community.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
trial
court
so
found
in
its
decision
when
it
ruled
that
these
were
community
property
and
the
wife
was
entitled
to
one-half
because
any
other
ruling
would
have
the
effect
of
stating
that
it
was
separate
property
and
the
husband
had
a
right
to
do
this.
i
want
to
briefly
outline
what
the
state
--
in
the
supreme
court
of
state
of
washington
found
in
these
matters
after
argument.
on
page
19
of
the
record,
supreme
court
says,
"this
purchase
was
in
fraud
of
the
rights
of
the
respondent
wife"
and
then
after
a
test,
this
was
a
unilateral
attempt
to
convert
community
property
into
separate
property
and
void
ab
initio.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
alright,
assuming
there
was
fraud,
we'll
go
on
from
there.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
initially,
the
first
answer
to
that
question
your
honor
is
that
the
husband
has
--
does
not
have
the
present
right
to
distribute
or
giveaway
or
use
one-half
of
the
community
property.
their
ownership
of
community
property
is
an
undivided
half
interest,
and
a
husband
cannot
unilaterally
divide
the
community
property.
he
cannot
say
the
buick
is
mine
and
the
cadillac
is
yours
or
the
bank
account
is
mine
and
the
bonds
are
yours
or
make
any
other
division
without
consent
of
the
wife.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
i
do
not
believe
so.
my
--
the
--
our
survivorship
statute
says,
"they
own
this
and
on
death,
it
passes
half
to
each
subject
to
the
community
debts."
now,
admitting
in
this
case
or
admitting
as
we
did
in
--
in
the
record
in
1959
that
the
bonds
were
not
needed
to
pay
the
debts
of
the
community,
they
might
now
be
--
since
this
litigation
has
extended,
take
the
case
where
they
were
needed
then
the
husband
--
if
the
beneficiary
provisions
of
the
--
the
treasury
regulations
are
to
be
upheld
would
be
able
to
impose
upon
the
wife's
share
of
the
estate,
the
entire
burden
of
paying
the
community
debts
upon
his
death.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
he
does,
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
i
do
not
know.
i
would
say
he
--
he
cannot
say
--
say
particularly
which
half
as
--
as
he's
doing
in
this
case.
i
think
that
certainly,
he
--
he
can't
setup
the
two
trust
accounts,
one
for
each
and
say,
"this
is
mine
and
this
is
yours."
mr.
charles
w.
cone
i
believe
he
could
do
so,
yes
sir,
subject
to
the
community
debts.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
i
believe
it
does.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
your
honor
the
--
this
is
a
--
in
this
particular
case,
this
is
not
an
undivided
half
interest
to
the
wife,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
no.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
well,
in
--
in
this
particular
--
well,
i
am
trying
to
come
up
with
an
answer
sir.
if
--
if
--
mr.
charles
w.
cone
well,
i
see
then.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
well
i'm
--
i'm
arguing
your
honor
that
if
the
--
the
survivorship
provisions
must
be
upheld
then
a
husband
can
remove
that
portion
of
it
from
the
--
the
debts
of
the
community.
now,
in
this
case,
it
would
not
happen
but
--
it
could
in
other
cases.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
well,
i
think
the
--
the
rule
will
--
will
be
applied
in
other
cases
that
the
--
the
ruling
of
this
court
would
have
the
effect
of
stating
that
the
beneficiary
does
need
it
on
the
bonds
with
the
owner
of
half
of
them
and
--
and
if
that
is
the
ruling
then
in
other
cases,
the
--
the
wife
share
of
the
estate
can
be
depleted
as
i
say
by
the
community
debts.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
yes,
it
could.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
yes,
it
was.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
yes,
it
could.
there
--
there
is
another
point
we
should
consider
and
that
is
the
difference
in
this
case
and
that
of
free
versus
bland
in
--
in
the
--
your
decision
in
free
versus
bland
was
upholding
the
right
of
a
married
couple
to
take
advantage
of
the
survivorship
provisions
of
the
treasury
regulations.
in
this
case,
a
married
couple
was
not
doing
so.
one
member
of
the
marital
community
was
doing
so
and
--
and
there
is
considerable
difference.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
i
believe
so,
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
or
maybe
actual
fraud
if
he
intended
this
fact
--
mr.
charles
w.
cone
i
don't
think
i
suggested
it
was
based
on,
i
assume.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
that
--
that
is
one
of
the
questions,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
yes,
you
did.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
that's
one
of
the
problems
and
--
mr.
charles
w.
cone
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
it
has
the
--
the
effect
of
doing
so
because
upon
his
death,
the
wife
is
removed
from
many
access
to
that
portion
of
the
community
property
if
he
put
all
of
his,
say
all
of
his
money
into
--
into
bonds
payable-on-death
to
his
brother,
then
wife
would
be
the
divested
of
all
the
property.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
he
is
making
a
--
a
division
of
the
community
--
community
property
without
the
consent
of
his
wife.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
it
is
immediately
upon
his
death,
it
becomes
one.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
he
--
he
can't
leave
the
--
the
particular
money
or
the
particular
property
by
will.
it's
a
$15,000,
if
--
if
he
wrote
his
will
and
left
his
brother
$15,000,
it
would
still
be
subject
to
the
wife's
community
interest
if
it
was
insufficient
or
--
and
also
subject
to
the
community
debts.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
that
--
that's
true.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
cone
or
by
agreement
of
the
parties.
i
--
i
want
to
remind
the
court
since
we're
dealing
with
treasury
regulations
that
--
that
there's
one
cited
in
our
brief
cfr
315.5
and
if
precedes
these
regulations
concerning
the
survivorship
provisions
of
--
of
bonds
and
its
estates,
united
states
savings
bonds
are
issued
in
only
--
only
in
registered
form.
the
form
of
registration
must
express
the
actual
ownership
of
an
interest
in
the
bonds.
now,
we
contend
that
a
bond
purchase
without
consent
of
his
wife
by
a
husband
payable-on-death
to
someone
else
does
not
express
as
a
--
the
regulations
require
her
interest
in
the
bonds
because
she
retains
an
interest
in
these
bonds
until
her
death.
and
if
we're
going
to
--
and
we
think
that
is
the
intent
of
--
of
this
regulation
is
to
provide
that
the
survivorship
regulations
will
prevail
if
the
bonds
are
purchased
properly
and
show
the
proper
interest
to
the
parties
at
the
time
of
purchase.
now,
his
wife,
mrs.
yiatchos,
had
an
interest
in
these
bonds
throughout
the
--
the
marriage.
the
--
the
divesting
over
that
interest
was
in
violation
of
--
of
these
regulations,
in
this
regulation
as
well
as
the
survivorship
regulation
should
be
maintained.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
will
conclude
my
argument.
we
move
that
the
--
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
be
affirmed.
