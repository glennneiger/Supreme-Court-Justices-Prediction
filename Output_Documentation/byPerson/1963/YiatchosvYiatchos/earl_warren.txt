chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
do
you
suggest
that
this
was
a
management
of
the
affairs
distinguished
from
the
gifts
of
the
--
the
brother?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
does
this
--
this
case
differ
from
free
versus
bland
on
the
facts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
that
be
true
regardless
of
whether
he
did
it
over
the
objection
of
the
wife
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
it
wasn't
the
investments,
i
suppose
you
can
do
--
do
the
same
with
the
entire
(inaudible).
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
i
was
concerned
about
--
about
this.
as
i
understood
you,
your
position
as
of
when
he
bought
these
bonds,
he
was
engaging
in
the
management
of
the
estate
and
up
to
the
time
of
his
death,
it
was
management
of
the
estate
and
not
any
gift
of
any
kind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
gift
of
any
kind.
now,
i've
just
been
reading
your
statute
when
it
says,
"upon
the
death
of
either
husband
or
wife,
one-half
of
the
(inaudible)
shall
go
to
the
survivor
subject
to
the
community
debts
and
the
other
half
shall
be
subject
to
the
testamentary
disposition
of
the
deceased
husband
or
wife
subject
also
to
community
debts."
now,
is
this
some
testamentary
disposition?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
this
doesn't
say
testamentary
or
other
--
other
disposition
in
contemplation
of
death.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
we
find
that
in
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
thank
you.
chief
justice

(voice

does
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
this
does.
