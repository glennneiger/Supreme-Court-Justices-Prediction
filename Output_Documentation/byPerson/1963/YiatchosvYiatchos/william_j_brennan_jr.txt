justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
whitmore
i
don't
--
the
answer
you
gave
to
the
question
of
justice
white
because
that's
the
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
as
i
understand
it,
the
record
doesn't
enlighten
us
whether
the
bonds
--
what
he
did
under
the
will
accomplishes
the
method
to
dispose
of
more
than
half
of
the
estate.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
appreciate
that
but
this
case
as
i
recall
it
was
decided
before
the
free
and
bland,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so
that
--
at
least
to
the
extent
of
which
the
principle
and
the
exception
drafted
on
the
principle
in
that
case,
that
wasn't
only
to
the
party
for
the
lower
court,
was
it?
when
this
case
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
maybe
i
don't
understand
you
but
i
thought
you
answered
mr.
justice
white
that
if
--
what
he
attempted
to
dispose
of
by
will,
plus
what
he
has
done
with
these
bonds,
together
it
represents
the
effort
to
dispose
of
more
than
half
of
the
community
than
to
the
extent
that
it
exceeds
half
that
would
fall
within
the
exception
stated
in
free
and
bland.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
assuming
now,
different
beneficiaries
under
the
will
which
--
who
--
who
take
plus
the
$15,000,
brings
it
over
to
50%,
it
would
be
at
their
expense
but
not
at
the
expense
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
the
bond.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whereas
--
but
i
wonder
if
--
if
this
happened.
suppose
there
had
been
allegations
of
fraud
and
the
only
proof
that
had
been
that
the
$15,000
plus
what
was
given
under
the
will
exceeded
50%.
suppose
those
allegations
had
been
made
and
that
was
the
posture
in
which
the
case
had
come
here
then
what
would
the
result
be?
would
you
still
argue
that
it
must
be
of
the
expense
of
the
other
beneficiary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
--
and
not
within
the
exception
of
fraud?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
in
stating
any
of
the
$15,000
into
the
bonds
or
just
the
interest
of
the
beneficiary
of
the
will?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
on
your
position
in
--
in
summary
is
that
you
think
whether
or
not
within
the
fraud
(inaudible)
allegations,
it
doesn't
come
within
the
exception
under
--
to
your
plan
and
that
the
beneficiaries
of
these
bonds
are
entitled
outright
whatever
may
be
the
face
of
the
beneficiaries
under
will.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
in
this
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
come
may
i
just
ask
one
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
what
your
supreme
court
said.
and
what
--
what
it
actually
said
was,
"the
husband's
purchase
a
community
bonds,
the
bonds
payable
to
him
(inaudible)
after
his
debts
payable
inclusively
to
his
brother
was
in
fraud
of
the
right
to
the
respondent's
point.
this
was
a
unilateral
attempt
to
convert
community
property
into
separate
and
void
ab
initio.
now,
is
that
a
finding
as
a
matter
of
law
of
constructive
fraud?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
there's
no
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
why
--
that's
why
i
asked
the
question.
what
--
what
is
thereabout
that
little
two
sentences,
even
i
note,
the
only
two
i
find
in
the
opinion
in
its
view
of
the
question
of
fraud
to
suggest
that
this
was
based
on
any
evidence
of
actual
fraud
if
there
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
--
that
this
is
an
--
as
a
matter
of
constructive
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
the
problem
that
we
have
is
whether
that
for
the
purposes
of
our
exception
in
free
and
bland
is
fraud
as
a
question
of
federal
law,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
isn't
that
the
question?
didn't
--
didn't
we
make
in
free
and
bland
the
question
of
fraud
a
question
of
federal
law
rather
than
state
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so
the
problem
is
whether
we're
going
to
accept
that
state
rule
as
a
federal
rule
of
fraud
for
the
purposes
of
offenses?
