(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
that
the
beneficiary's
interest
in
any
event
can't
--
can't
arise
or
come
into
being
until
death?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
naming
the
beneficiary
anticipates
--
anticipates
creating
some
interest
at
death.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
their
gift
--
if
they
mature
they
are
cashed
in
their
community
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
--
i
got
a
suggestion
by
virtue
of
the
--
of
the
federal
law
that
his
effort
here
to
create
his
interest
in
the
beneficiary
which
--
which
would
arise
only
at
death,
would
extend
to
the
entire
proceeds
of
the
bonds.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
saying
then
that
by
virtue
of
the
federal
law,
he
may
dispose
of
--
in
a
--
in
the
--
by
the
equivalent
of
a
testamentary
disposition,
he
may
dispose
of
the
entire
proceeds
of
the
bonds
whereas
by
will,
he
could
only
dispose
of
--
of
one
half.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
admit
the
statement
that
if
these
bonds
here
represented
the
entire
community
estate.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
would
you
justify
them,
the
three
of
(inaudible),
you
say
this
is
fraud?
justice
byron
r.
white
more
than
half.
justice
byron
r.
white
within
the
exceptions?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there's
no
proof
here
though
--
is
there
proof
here
as
to
--
as
to
the
relationship
between
these
bonds
in
the
estate?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
much
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
did
he
attempt
to
dispose
of
by
will?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
record
doesn't
show
then
what
is
the
face
value
of
the
bonds
plus
what
he
attempted
in
his
own
will
to
dispose
of
equals
more
than
half
of
the
estate.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
doesn't
show
in
the
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
you
mean
there
should
be
a
--
the
fact
that
the
--
you
say
that
it
was
up
to
the
--
the
other
side
to
allege
and
prove
the
fraud
and
since
they
didn't,
they're
out
of
court
on
the
fraud.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
would
not
--
you
would
not
believe
it's
open
for
a
--
for
the
proceedings
of
the
law,
must
likely
you
did
--
like
you
said
in
the
free
and
bland.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
free
against
bland.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
i
thought
that
you
answered
justice
douglas
a
while
ago
that
there
would
be
pro
tanto.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
might
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
if
the
figures
could
be
such
of
course
that
in
order
to
make
and
make
it
up,
the
other
beneficiaries
under
the
will
wouldn't
have
enough
left
to
them.
i
mean
and
for
example
that
the
$15,000
for
the
entire
estate,
obviously
you
would
have
--
you
wouldn't
say
that
(inaudible)
going
to
have
to
wife.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
still
need
some
more
facts
before
you
know
whether
this
$15,000
(inaudible)
facts
in
the
record
to
show
--
justice
byron
r.
white
wait
a
minute,
is
this
the
entire
estate
is
how
much?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
aside
from
the
bonds
or
including?
justice
byron
r.
white
including
the
bonds.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
yes,
if
--
but
we
don't
want
the
community
debts
are,
do
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
that
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
the
bonds
or
the
debts
that
he
have
all
--
all
of
the
non
--
but
all
of
the
non-bond
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
you
--
i
understand
you,
you've
got
that
approach
too
but
on
the
facts
here,
we
do
not
know
really,
on
this
record
whether
or
not
any
of
the
bonds
are
needed
to
satisfy
the
wife's
half
of
the
estate.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
surely
they
are
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
why
--
did
you
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
--
why
is
the
mere
act
of
purchasing
the
bonds
and
putting
--
and
putting
them
in
his
name
alone
would
the
beneficiary
--
with
his
brother
as
beneficiary
which
particularly
says
that
this
is
upon
death.
why
is
that
--
why
is
that
act
alone
--
why
does
that
act
amounts
to
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that
--
i
understand
(inaudible).
probably,
he'll
have
a
problem
that
these
bonds
are
not
with
the
entire
estate.
let's
assume
for
the
moment
the
bonds
are
invest,
it
wouldn't
have
to
be
estates,
at
the
time
he's
(inaudible)
and
continuously
thereafter,
(inaudible)
what
is
--
what
is
really
brought
you
with
the
husband
is
buying
a
$15,000
worth
of
bonds
with
his
entire
estate,
let's
assume
it's
$60,000
for
these
bonds.
what
is
the
(inaudible)
of
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
isn't
the
provision,
it's
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
the
other
your
laws
--
your
law
that
allows
this
--
allows
this
by
another
type
of
(inaudible)
piece
paper,
he
could
leave
exactly
the
same
amount
to
his
brother,
does
not
(inaudible)?
