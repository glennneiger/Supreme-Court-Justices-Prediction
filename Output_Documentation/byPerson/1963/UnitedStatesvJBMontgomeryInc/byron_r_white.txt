but
as
long
as
he
was
hauling
that
kind
of
a
commodity
or
that
kind
of
a
customer,
you
can
haul
at
any
place
with
any
of
the
geographical
areas.

more
important
law
does
decide
it
here,
what
happened
to
the
(inaudible)
remand
or?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
certainly
the
commission
decided
that
--
and
that
is
giving
a
certificate
of
substantial
parity.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
thought
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
might
be
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
--
you
seemed
to
--
you
seemed
to
agree
that
they're
some
regard
of
to
who's
responsible,
there
are
some
facts
the
commission
hasn't
considered.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
certificate
somewhat
broader
than
in
--
in
one
way
broader
than
the
old
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
give
more?
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

grand
or
the
other
grandfather
clauses
(inaudible)?
justice

white
(inaudible)
covered
two
points
now,
haven't
you?
you've
said,
they
had
no
authority
to
impose
any
restrictions
beyond
a
commodity
and
a
territory
restriction
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you've
made
that
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you're
saying
that
--
that
they've
also
--
even
if
they
had
that
--
even
if
they
had
authority
to
impose
some
restrictions
that
they
couldn't
impose
the
ones
you're
now
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
is
that
--
is
that
point
here
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
opponent
suggests
that
this
was
never
raised
before
the
commission
or
in
the
district
court
and
that
couldn't
be
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
did
you
bring
up
the
fact
that
you
--
you
suggested
you
did
not
bring
up
the
fact
that
there
were
many
of
--
many
of
the
--
many
runs
that
you
were
making
before
you
could
not
make
in
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
the
same
--
the
same
runs
if
you
list
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
give
some
of
those?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
to
show
that
the
commission
understood
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
or
that
--
or
--
or
should
have
understood
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
experts.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
here
it
sounds
like
you're
turning
the
question
around
that
saying
that,
the
issue
that's
really
here
is
the
validity
of
the
precise
restrictions
that
they
imposed
on
montgomery,
if
they
might've
--
if
they
could've
put
less
restrictions
on
that
question
isn't
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
assuming
that
the
--
that's
a
little
different
point
than
you
just
--
just
had
--
just
made,
you
say
that
it
didn't
have
any
right
to
put
on
a
keystone
restriction
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
i
didn't
hear
that
the
commission
did
have
the
power
to
uphold
the
restrictions
which
would
affect
substantial
parity.
what
would
--
if
the
court
gets
that
far
and
then
what
do
you
suggest?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
commission
thought
it
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
commission
thought
it
did
but
it
was
maybe
not
parity
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
substantial
parity.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
we
differ
with
it
and
how
can
we
be
differ
with
the
commission
of
what
--
of
what
substantial
--
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
the
commission
think
to
be
substantial
parity?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
the
commission
think
this
was
--
this
certificate
effected
substantial
parity?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
this
is
--
their
aim
is
that
the
brooks
case
into
this
one
is
to
affect
substantial
parity.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
district
court
didn't
even
get
to
this
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)--
there
some
authority
that
he
remanded
the
commission
and
say
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
decide
--
justice
byron
r.
white
decide
whether
their
substantial
parity?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
it
sounds
as
though
we're
saying
to
them,
you
have
the
power
to
affect
substantial
parity
with
these
restrictions.
we
could
guess
that
you
do
your
job
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
already
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
found
substantial
parity
that
we
think
you
were
wrong
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
do
it
again.
