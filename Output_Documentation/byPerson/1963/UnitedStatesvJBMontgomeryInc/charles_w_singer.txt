mr.
charles
w.
singer
the
basic
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
montgomery
as
a
converted
carrier,
precede
a
certificate
which
authorized
the
transportation
of
the
same
commodities
between
the
same
points
or
within
the
same
territory
as
contained
in
its
permit
of
the
contract
carrier.
it
is
our
basic
position
that
the
imposition
of
restrictions
limiting
shipments
to
those
moving
from
to
or
between
particular
types
of
businesses
is
a
territorial
restriction
which
detracts
or
takes
away
from
the
authority
held
by
montgomery
as
a
contract
carrier.
it
is
our
further
basic
position
that
the
commission
was
wholly
without
the
statutory
authority
and
right
to
impose
such
restriction.
the
attorney
for
the
government
indicates
that
the
whole
basis
for
their
position
is
that
they
were
--
the
commission
was
attempting
to
establish
substantial
parity
between
the
authority
held
by
montgomery
as
a
contract
carrier
and
that
to
be
received
by
it
as
a
common
carrier.
the
commission
and
the
government
virtually
admit
both
in
their
brief
and
in
this
oral
presentation
that
something
has
been
taken
away
from
montgomery
as
converted
carrier.
in
their
brief,
they
say
that
this
would
be
a
small
price
to
pay
for
the
mischief
of
a
grant
of
unlimited
authority.
we
submit
that
so
far
as
montgomery
is
concerned,
it
is
a
very
great
price
and
something
very
real
and
substantial
is
being
taken
away
from
this
carrier.
now,
i
know
that
--
that
my
opponent
did
not
intentionally
misstate
montgomery's
authority
but
montgomery's
authority
is
not
a
point-to-point
authority.
it
is
a
broad
territorial
grant
of
authority.
it
authorizes
service
between
chicago
and
denver
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other,
all
points
in
northern
illinois,
all
points
in
iowa,
nebraska,
kansas
and
that
portion
of
colorado
east
to
the
continental
divide.
this
is
an
extremely
broad
territorial
authority
and
permits
montgomery
or
permitted
them
as
a
contract
carrier
to
originate
at
or
deliver
shipments
at
any
point
within
this
territory.
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
the
commission
properly
stated
the
law
that
as
a
contract
carrier
under
contract
with
certain
types
of
shipper,
shipments
could
be
originated
at
or
destined
to
any
point
within
the
authorized
scope
of
montgomery's
authority.
as
a
converted
carrier,
montgomery
is
limited
to
movements
from,
to
or
between
certain
points
within
that
territory.
basically,
in
the
transportation
of
meat
for
example,
meat
packing
houses
--
mr.
charles
w.
singer
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
that's
right.
they
have
--
even
assuming
and
we
don't
conceive
this
and
we
submit
it's
wholly
contract,
the
legislative
history
in
the
act
that
--
that
this
case
should
have
been
decided
on
the
basis
of
substantial
parity.
the
authority
that
was
granted
to
montgomery
as
a
common
carrier
did
not
fulfill
the
test
of
substantial
parity.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
that
isn't
correct.
the
--
the
questions
--
the
four
questions
of
the
--
the
keystone
type
of
restrictions
were
raised
before
the
commission
in
our
case,
i'm
talking
about
the
montgomery
case,
was
decided
in
the
commission
on
the
basis
of
the
t.t.
brooks
case,
a
--
a
precedent
case
on
this
field
--
mr.
charles
w.
singer
well,
we
did
this
mr.
justice
white.
we
pointed
out
in
our
evidence
the
operations
that
we
were
performing,
and
we
pointed
out
that
the
examiner
in
the
case
granted
us
an
unrestricted
authority.
we
brought
before
the
district
court
the
same
examples
and
the
court
--
mr.
charles
w.
singer
yes,
this
was
brought
before
the
commission
--
mr.
charles
w.
singer
no,
not
the
same
examples.
we
told
the
commission
that
we
were
not
receiving
an
authority
that
permitted
the
transportation
of
the
same
commodity
between
the
same
points.
no,
we
didn't
give
all
of
the
examples.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
we
gave
some
of
them,
yes.
now,
in
the
--
in
the
case
before
the
district
court,
the
district
court
as
i
read
the
opinion,
assumed
that
there
were
territorial
limitations.
we
brought
up
before
the
district
court
and
in
our
brief,
substantially
the
same
examples
that
are
before
this
court
and
the
court
specifically
indicated.
i
see
if
i
can
find
the
--
the
montgomery
contends
that
the
last
paragraph,
sentence
of
section
212
was
mandatory
and
allows
the
commission
no
discretion
to
--
or
power
to
impose
territorial
restrictions
not
contained
in
the
permit.
and
while
the
lower
court
did
not
specifically
point
out
these
examples,
they
--
they
assumed
that
these
were
territorial
restrictions
and
then
dealt
with
the
question
of
whether
the
commission
had
the
statutory
power
to
impose
these
restrictions.
so
going
back
to
your
question,
we
submit
that
these
are
territorial
restrictions
and
that
any
similar
restrictions
which
could
be
imposed
by
the
commission,
would
be
territorial
restrictions
and
would
be
beyond
the
statutory
power.
now,
we've
given
numerous
examples
in
our
brief
as
to
the
territorial
taper
restrictions
but
just
so
that
it
would
be
clear,
let
we
give
several
pertinent
examples.
for
example,
under
the
contract
with
a
department
store
which
was
within
the
authority
of
montgomery,
it
could
perform
service
from
or
to
any
point
that
was
designated
by
that
department
store
contracting
shipper.
it
could
go
from
a
supplier
of
a
department
store,
a
manufacturing
concern
and
make
delivery
directly
to
a
customer.
it
could
perform
a
service
in
handling
small
packages
for
example,
where
the
shipment
instead
of
originating
at
the
department
store,
originated
either
at
a
public
warehouse
or
consolidation
point
or
supplier
in
--
mr.
charles
w.
singer
well
--
mr.
charles
w.
singer
--
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
charles
w.
singer
they
should've
understood
it
because
they
--
they
were
purportedly
the
expertise
--
mr.
charles
w.
singer
--
in
the
matter
and
the
only
thing
that
we
did
in
our
presentation
before
the
commission
was
to
show
as
required
by
the
statute
that
the
operations
of
montgomery
as
of
the
statutory
date,
did
not
fall
within
the
new
definition
of
contract
carry
were
those
of
the
common
carrier
and
were
otherwise
lawful.
and
this
question
came
up
at
the
hearing.
the
--
the
argument
was
raised
at
the
hearing,
well
maybe
montgomery's
rights
are
dormant
and
certainly
--
mr.
charles
w.
singer
well,
the
--
the
question
--
there're
two
questions
before
this
court
as
i
see
it.
one,
of
whether
or
not
the
montgomery
did
in
fact
receive
a
certificate
authorizing
the
transportation
of
the
same
commodities
within
the
same
point.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
between
the
same
point.
and
two,
whether
the
commission
had
any
statutory
power
at
all
to
impose
a
restriction
of
this
nature
because
if
the
restriction
had
read
--
restricted
to
movements
from,
to
and
between
warehouses,
suppliers,
ports,
farms
and
--
and
wholesale
and
retail
department
store,
that
would
still
be
a
--
a
territorial
restriction.
it
would
be
like
the
commission
flipping
a
coin
to
try
to
determine
that
the
restriction
they
impose
would
allow
montgomery
to
perform
the
same
operations
that
they
were
authorized
as
a
contract
carrier.
the
simple
fact
is
that
as
a
contract
carrier
under
contract
for
the
department
store
or
under
contract
for
the
wholesale
or
retail,
meat,
fruit
and
vegetable
packing
house,
they
could
go
from
or
to
any
point
within
their
territory.
if
the
--
if
the
--
a
meat
packing
house
told
him
to
go
out
and
--
and
pick
up
some
hides,
they're
out
on
the
farm,
they
would
have
the
authority
to
do
it.
if
the
meat
packing
company
told
him
to
go
to
a
port,
chicago
is
becoming
a
great
port
through
the
st.
lawrence
seaway,
and
make
a
delivery
to
a
customer
of
armour
or
swift,
they
could
do
it.
but,
as
a
--
as
a
common
carrier,
every
movement
that
they
have
must
go
from,
to
or
between
a
wholesale
or
retail
department
store
or
from,
to
or
between
a
meat,
fruit
and
vegetable
packing
house.
and
if
the
commission
then
--
if
this
was
remanded
that
the
commission
for
the
purpose
of
an
--
of
lessening
that,
they
would
have
to
think
of
some
other
points
where
they
thought
the
carrier
might
have
gone
as
a
contract
carrier
and
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
even
in
the
infinite
wisdom
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
they
could
not
conceive
of
the
operations
which
for
the
future
might
be
formed
by
montgomery.
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
is
so
clear
that
nothing
would
be
taken
away
from
the
converted
carrier.
we
have
quoted
on
pages
21
and
22
of
our
brief,
what
i
considered
to
be
the
controlling
legislative
history
in
this
case.
the
question
was
presented
to
the
then
chairman
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
mr.
clarke.
is
there
any
constitutional
question
involved
in
this
conversion?
and
i
think
he
meant
was
any
property
being
taken
away
from
these
converted
carriers
without
due
processes
of
law
and
mr.
chairman
clarke
says,
"no,
i
can
see
none.
it
isn't
taking
away
from
them
anything
that
they
have."
and
--
and
it's
clear
here
and
it's
admitted
by
the
government
that
something
is
being
taken
away
from
them
in
any
restriction
that
is
imposed
would
take
something
away
from
them.
and
mr.
clarke
then
goes
on
to
point
out
that
they
are
given
greater
opportunities.
they
have
the
opportunity
to
serve
the
public.
this
court
would
go
back
and
review
its
decision
in
the
noble
case
which
was
the
decision
wherein
in
this
court
affirmed
in
1943,
the
right
of
the
commission
to
oppose
the
original
keystone
restrictions.
it
would
find
that
the
court
said
that
if
they
should
remove
the
keystone
restrictions,
it
would
result
in
a
conversion
of
the
carrier
to
common
carriage.
for
all
we're
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
say
that
--
that
since
this
conversion
act
was
enacted
by
the
commission
as
a
result
of
--
of
your
decision
in
the
contract
steel
carriers
case
that
let's
give
montgomery
an
authority
that's
a
common
carrier
authority.
the
imposition
of
the
keystone
restrictions
were
for
the
specific
purpose
of
preventing
it
from
serving
the
general
public
and
now
the
commission
comes
along
and
they
say,
it's
inappropriate
for
us
to
impose
the
keystone
type
of
restriction
because
of
the
obligation
of
the
--
of
the
common
carrier
--
of
a
common
carrier,
but
they
tried
to
reward
the
thing
so
that
montgomery
can't
even
do
as
much
for
its
former
contracting
shippers
as
it
could
before.
and
i
say
that
this
--
mr.
charles
w.
singer
that's
right.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
and
--
and
--
mr.
charles
w.
singer
and
i'll
say
the
reason
why
they
had
the
right
to
put
on
a
keystone
restriction
originally
was
the
specific
language
of
section
209.
now,
there
is
nothing
that
ties
in
section
212
(c)
with
section
208
or
there's
nothing
whereby
the
commission
could
have
implied
that
they
had
the
power
to
try
to
take
the
keystone
restriction
and
work
it
around
into
what
they
term
something
manageable
and
impose
it
on
the
carrier.
the
commission
went
the
great
length
in
imposing
the
keystone
restriction
to
--
to
show
that
they
have
the
power
to
the
specific
statutory
language
of
section
209.
this
court
in
affirming
the
interstate
commerce
commission
said
they
--
they
derive
their
power
from
section
209,
in
209
and
in
--
in
essence
said
that
the
commission
had
the
right
to
specify
the
business
of
the
contract
carrier
and
to
impose
such
conditions
for
limitations
as
were
consistent
with
the
contract
carrier's
status.
so
when
you
--
when
you
have
one
act
or
one
section
of
the
act,
where
the
commission
has
the
specific
statutory
power,
when
you
have
section
208
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
was
the
basis
for
deciding
the
grandfather
applications
of
--
of
common
carriers
in
1935
where
they
are
specifically
given
the
power
to
impose
restrictions
or
limitation,
how
can
you
say
that
--
that
congress
did
not
intend
--
or
that
congress
intended
to
give
them
the
power
under
section
212
when
they
don't
even
mention
it?
if
--
mr.
charles
w.
singer
well,
then
they
--
if
they
would
get
that
far
and
i'd
hope
they
wouldn't,
they'd
have
to
remand
this
case
back
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
because
--
because
it
is
clear
and
it's
admitted
by
the
government
that
the
certificate
issued
to
montgomery
does
not
maintain
substantial
parity.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
well,
they
were
--
mr.
charles
w.
singer
well,
they
did
it.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
they
did.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
well,
you
don't
have
to
differ
with
the
commission,
you
just
remanded
--
if
you
reach
that
point
--
mr.
charles
w.
singer
what?
mr.
charles
w.
singer
well,
i
don't
think
that
they
--
they
dwell
on
it.
they
had
decided
in
the
brooks
case,
they
were
going
to
impose
these
types
of
restrictions.
our
case
came
along
a
year
later
and
every
other
case,
like
it
and
they
said
the
brooks
case
controls.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
yes,
but
it's
--
it's
clear
to
--
to
me
as
it's
admitted
by
the
government
then
--
the
bench
seems
to
have
the
same
view
that
--
that
there
was
not
substantial
parity
affected.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
well,
i'm
--
i
think
they
did.
really,
the
first
question
that
was
asked
by
the
circuit
court
judge
brandenstein
to
the
commission's
attorney,
isn't
this
a
case
where
something
that
being
taken
away
from
the
converted
carrier?
now,
they
didn't
--
they
didn't
spell
it
out
in
their
opinion.
they
gave
my
contention
that
there
was
a
territory
restriction
and
their
whole
decision
was
on
the
basis
--
was
there
statutory
power?
mr.
charles
w.
singer
say,
review
this
matter
--
mr.
charles
w.
singer
--
in
the
light
of
our
--
mr.
charles
w.
singer
no.
no,
you
review
this
in
this
light
of
our
opinion.
you
say
that
--
that
from
the
arguments
it
presented,
it
appears
that
--
that
there
is
not
substantial
parity
affected
between
the
permit
granted
to
montgomery
as
a
contract
carrier.
i
mean,
the
certificate
granted
to
him
as
a
common
carrier
and
they
affirmed
it
as
a
contract
carrier.
so
you
don't
--
you
don't
decide
to
what
extent
it
should
be
modified
but
it
--
it's
obvious
from
a
reading
of
the
certificate
that
they
cannot
do
for
their
former
contracting
shippers
what
they
could've
as
a
contract
carrier.
so,
that's
plain
from
the
--
from
the
certificate
itself,
from
the
examples
that
i
gave
so
it
is
--
you
don't
have
to
go
beyond
that
or
you
don't
have
to
say
to
the
commission,
"you
should
impose
this
type
of
restriction."
but
if
you
felt
that
they
have
the
statutory
power
to
impose
the
restriction,
then
at
a
minimum,
it
should
be
remanded
to
them
to
give
consideration
to
what
type
of
restrictions
should
be
imposed
that
would
create
substantial
parity.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
no,
they
don't
--
mr.
charles
w.
singer
--
you're
not
telling
to
--
mr.
charles
w.
singer
no.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
you
just
ask
them
to
--
to
look
at
it.
if
they
come
up
with
the
same
result,
then
the
matter
can
be
--
re-litic
--
re-litigated.
but
if
--
if
you
are
merely
telling
that
--
that
this
question
was
not
considered
by
you,
in
your
report,
take
the
case
back
and
reconsider
it.
i
hate
to
think
that
that
--
that's
going
to
be
the
result
of
this
case
because
i
--
i
feel
so
strongly
that
--
that
the
commission
just
push
without
any
statutory
power
that
they
--
they
usurped
the
legislative
function
or
maybe
the
legislature
was
remised
in
not
enacting
the
statute
that
was
clear.
but
i'll
--
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
--
that
in
this
whole
field
of
contract
carriers,
the
commission
appears
that
it
had
a
mental
block.
you
have
before
you
the
contract
steel
carrier's
case,
where
the
commission
said
that
we
could
--
that
they
would
have
the
power
to
limit
the
number
of
contracts
that
the
contract
carrier
would
enter
into.
you
said
that
that
was
wholly
beyond
their
statutory
power.
they
were
reading
into
then
section
209,
a
power
they
didn't
have.
you
had
before
you
the
j-t
case
which
involved
the
--
the
criteria
for
granting
contract
carrier
authority
and
the
commission
read
into
that
a
fifth
or
sixth
test
for
determining
the
application,
the
adequacy
of
existing
common
carrier
service.
i
think
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
that
opinion
and
--
and
you
said
they
--
they
tried
to
legislate
in
that
case.
well,
i
submit
that
they
tried
to
legislate
here.
mr.
charles

singer
the
first
--
the
original
affirmative
on
page

and

--
mr.
charles
w.
singer
56
--
mr.
charles
w.
singer
yes,
i
think
that
--
mr.
charles
w.
singer
that's
right,
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
that's
right.
that
was
also
the
keystone
restriction
that
we're
referring
to.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
that's
right.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
that's
right.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
that's
right.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
that's
right.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
points
in
territory
--
points
in
territory.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
that's
right.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
that's
right.
i'm
saying
that
that
is
--
is
the
territorial
restriction
that
in
effect
the
commission
purports
to
grant
the
same
territory
but
then
takes
away
from
it
by
the
--
by
saying
that
all
of
the
movements
have
to
be
from,
to
or
between
specified
types
of
businesses.
and
that's
where
i
say
that
the
--
mr.
charles
w.
singer
they
--
mr.
charles
w.
singer
yes.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
w.
singer
that's
right
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
--
mr.
charles
w.
singer
that's
right,
and
i'd
--
mr.
charles
w.
singer
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
plant
site
restrictions,
the
commission
imposes,
derive
--
or
the
commission
derives
the
power
to
impose
that
specifically
from
section
208
of
the
act.
that's
one
of
the
powers
that
they
have
in
granting
certificates
under
section
208
but
section
208
is
limited
to
application
under
section
206
or
207.
now,
if
--
if
the
congress
had
put
the
same
statute
under
206
or
207,
then
the
commission
might
have
had
a
power
to
impose
restrictions
under
208.
but
this
is
sitting
off
by
itself.
it
stands
by
itself.
it
refers
to
nothing
else
from
the
act
and
just
seems
that
it
--
that
congress
had
intend
that
nothing
would
be
taken
away
from
the
converted
carrier
and
it
would
be
given
this
very
opportunity
to
serve
the
public
because
under
the
restrictions
from,
to
or
between
departments
stores,
it
can't
serve
the
public.
it
can't
--
it
can't
serve
anybody
other
than
who
--
the
person
who's
serving
for
and
it
can't
do
as
completed
job
for
them
as
it
could
before.
thank
you
very
much.
