mr.
frank
i.
goodman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
by
the
united
states
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
from
a
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
colorado.
the
case
arises
under
section
212
(c)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
involves
the
validity
of
certain
restrictions
which
the
commission
placed
in
the
certificate
of
a
motor
carrier
upon
converting
it
from
contract
carrier
status
to
common
carrier
status.
i
think
that
a
brief
description
of
the
legal
context
of
which
the
case
arises
might
be
helpful
to
an
understanding
of
the
facts.
prior
to
1957,
the
motor
carrier
act
defined
contract
carriers
as
any
carriers
other
than
common
carriers
who
engaged
in
transportation
under
individual
contracts
or
agreements.
in
1957
however,
at
the
request
of
the
commission,
congress
tightened
that
definition
so
as
to
restrict
the
term
'contract
carrier'
to
those
who
engaged
in
transportation
under
continuing
contracts
with
one
or
limited
number
of
shippers
and
who
either
allocated
vehicles
for
a
continuing
period
for
the
exclusive
use
of
each
individual
customer
or
who
performed
the
service
designed
to
meet
a
distinctive
need
of
each
individual
customer.
in
addition
and
also
at
the
urging
of
the
commission,
congress
enacted
section
212
(c)
a
'grandfather
clause'
providing
for
the
conversion
to
common
carrier
status
of
those
contract
carriers
whose
operations
were
so
extensive
or
so
generalized
that
they
did
not
fit
the
new
amended
definition
of
contract
carrier.
section
212
(c)
provided
that
the
commission
might
revoke
the
permit
of
any
such
contract
carrier
and
issue
it
instead
a
common
carrier
certificate
authorizing
transportation
of
the
same
commodities
between
the
same
points
or
within
the
same
territories
as
is
authorized
by
the
permit.
it's
against
that
legal
background
that
this
case
arises.
prior
to
1957,
j.b.
montgomery
incorporated
was
operating
as
a
contract
carrier
under
a
permit
issued
to
its
predecessor
in
1943
under
the
grandfather
clause
of
the
motor
carrier
act.
montgomery's
permit
authorized
it
to
serve
designated
points
within
abroad
mid-western
area,
and
the
carry
commodities
which
were
described
by
reference
to
the
particular
kinds
of
businesses
which
customarily
dealt
in
or
used
those
commodities.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
--
in
--
well,
point
were
in
terms
of
cities.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
yes.
in
general,
it
was
from
denver
to
chicago
and
various
points
in
between.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no,
no.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
right
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no,
i
--
i
don't
conceived
at
all.
in
this
particular
case,
the
--
described
the
points
happened
to
be
cities
but
in
many
instances,
common
carriers
or
contract
carriers
are
limited
to
shipping
points
which
are
not
cities
but
which
maybe
identified
as
plant
sites
for
example
of
particular
businesses
or
particular
classes
of
businesses
and
in
those
instances,
i
would
suppose
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no,
that
is
that
our
contentions
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i
might
anticipate
for
a
moment
by
saying
that
our
contention
is
that
under
the
permit
as
a
practical
matter
by
virtue
of
restrictions
other
than
the
explicit
point-to-point
restrictions,
this
carrier
was
confined
in
fact,
to
movements,
to
from
and
between
the
particular
kinds
of
businesses
that
will
later
describe
in
the
certificate
restriction.
that
limitation
was
not
explicit
in
the
permit
but
it
was
implicit
there.
now,
the
commodities
which
montgomery
was
authorized
to
carry
were
the
following,
such
commodities
as
are
usually
dealt
in
or
used
by
wholesale
and
retail
department
stores.
secondly,
such
commodities
as
are
usually
dealt
in
or
used
by
meat,
fruit
and
vegetable
packing
houses.
and
thirdly,
such
commodities
as
are
usually
dealt
in
by
wholesale
of
retail
hardware
and
automobile
accessory
business
houses.
in
addition,
in
connection
with
each
of
these
three
commodity
categories,
the
permit
contained
a
so-called
keystone
restriction.
this
was
a
restriction
limiting
montgomery
to
performing
services
under
contract
with
persons
engaged
in
the
particular
kind
of
business
associated
with
the
commodities.
in
other
words,
with
wholesale
and
retail
department
stores,
wholesale
and
retail
sellers
of
packing
house
products
and
wholesale
and
retail
auto
bill
--
automobile
accessory
in
hardware
dealers.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
yes,
to
anybody.
that's
right.
he
was
authorized
to
haul
it
to
anybody
so
long
as
it
was
under
contract
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
customers.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no,
no
that
is
not
--
that's
not
our
argument
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
section
212
(c)
in
terms,
does
not
say
anything
about
customers
and
therefore
would
not
limit
the
--
would
not
preclude
the
commission
from
including
in
the
common
carrier
certificate.
the
keystone
restrictions
involved
here
verbatim,
in
other
words
had
the
commission
--
had
the
commission
carried
over
the
keystone
restrictions
into
the
certificate
verbatim.
i
see
nothing
in
section
212
(c)
which
would
have
precluded
that.
it
would
not
--
it
would
not
authorize
the
carriage
of
commodities
between
diff
--
any
different
points
or
the
carriage
of
any
different
commodities
or
within
any
different
territories,
then
have
been
authorized
in
the
permit.
in
other
words,
i
--
i
take
it
that
the
objection
to
carrying
over
keystone
restrictions
from
the
permit
to
the
certificate
does
not
arise
from
section
212
(c).
the
objection
rather
is
the
keystone
restrictions
in
their
traditional
form,
namely
as
limitations
upon
the
classic
persons
whom
the
carrier
may
serve,
are
in
inconsistent
with
the
status
of
a
common
carrier.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
we
don't
read
that
as
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
we
don't
read
that
as
a
--
as
a
prohibition
upon
including
in
the
certificate
any
other
provisions
that
might
be
contained
in
the
permit
and
which
are
not
in
any
way
inconsistent
with
that
statutory
mandate.
in
other
words,
we
think
that
if
the
commission
had
carried
over
to
the
certificate
every
restriction
contained
in
the
permit,
so
that
the
certificate
was
our
trainee's
copy
of
the
permit.
there
could
be
no
objection
under
section
212
(c).
the
objection
would
lie
rather
in
the
other
circumstance
that
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
namely
that
it
simply
wouldn't
be
appropriate
to
put
keystone
restrictions
as
such
in
a
common
carrier
certificate.
i
think
that
the
principal
objection
--
i
maybe
wrong
with
the
principal
objection
that
mr.
singer
makes
to
--
well
i
--
let
me
withdraw
that.
i
--
i'm
exactly
sure
what
the
principal
objection
is
but
the
only
objection
that
might
have
some
substance
against
carrying
over
a
keystone
restriction
verbatim
would
be
that
a
contract
--
a
common
carrier
is
a
carrier
which
holds
itself
out
to
the
general
public
and
the
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that's
--
well,
if
you
interpret
the
language
as
a
common
carrier
to
mean
that,
then
that
might
be
the
source
of
the
objection
and
i
will
address
myself
to
that
objection
too.
after
the
1957
amendments
to
the
statute,
the
commission
instituted
a
proceeding
to
determine
whether
montgomery's
operations
were
such
as
to
require
its
conversion
to
common
carrier
status.
montgomery
itself
later
filed
an
application
for
conversion
to,
and
various
common
carriers
intervened
in
opposition.
the
commission
concluded
that
montgomery's
operations
did
not
conform
to
the
amended
definition
of
the
contract
carrier.
it
revoked
its
permit
and
issued
it
in
lieu
thereof,
a
common
carrier
certificate.
the
common
carrier
certificate
carried
over
without
significant
change,
the
explicit
commodity
in
territorial
descriptions
contained
in
the
permit.
it
did
not
carry
over,
however,
in
explicit
form,
the
case
on
restrictions.
the
commission
considering
it
inappropriate
to
put
in
a
common
carrier
certificate
limitations
which
explicitly
defined
the
persons
with
whom
the
carrier
might
deal.
the
commission
did
state,
however,
that
there
should
be
contained
in
the
certificate,
provisions
which
continued
to
whatever
extent
was
possible.
the
substance
of
the
limitations
contained
in
the
keystone
restrictions.
and
accordingly,
it
placed
in
the
certificate
that
limitations
confining
the
carrier
to
move
shipments
moving
to,
from
and
between
the
designated
types
of
business
establishment.
the
purpose
of
this
restriction,
in
the
commission's
words,
was
to
enable
the
carrier
to
furnish
the
same
service
which
it
had
been
authorized
to
provide
as
a
contract
carrier
thereby
ensuring
substantial
parity
between
the
permanent
authority
and
the
certificate
authority.
montgomery
filed
suit
in
the
district
court
to
set
aside
the
commission's
order
insofar
as
it
contained
these
particular
restrictions.
the
district
court
held
the
commission
had
no
statutory
authority
to
impose
such
restrictions
and
it
reversed
and
remanded
the
case
of
the
commission.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no,
mr.
justice
white,
it
did
not.
and
i
think
that's
a
significant
point.
i'd
like
to
say
first
that
there
are
really
two
questions
involved
here
under
section
212
(c)
and
they
need
to
be
sharply
kept
--
sharply
distinguished.
the
first
and
the
only
important
question
is
whether
or
not,
the
commission
has
authority
to
transfer
to
the
certificate
in
any
appropriate
form
whatever,
the
commodity
and
territorial
limitations
which
are
implicit
in
the
keystone
restrictions.
that
was
the
only
issue
which
was
decided
by
the
district
court
and
under
the
terms
of
its
remand,
the
commission
would
have
no
alternative
but
to
delete
these
provisions
altogether.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
exactly
and
that
is
the
question
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
yes,
that's
right.
but
the
court
did
not
--
did
not
decide
whether
the
commission
would
have
--
whether
--
did
not
decide
whether
these
particular
restrictions
were
broad
enough
to
achieve
their
stated
purpose
of
giving
substantial
term
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
let
me
say
this,
first,
that
question
wasn't
even
presented
to
the
commission
in
the
first
place.
the
commission
was
never
advised
by
montgomery
that
there
were
certain
kinds
of
movements
which
it
could've
made
under
the
permit
but
cannot
make
under
the
certificate
restrictions.
had
it
done
so,
the
commission
would
have
been
of
had
an
opportunity
perhaps
to
modify
the
language
in
such
a
way
as
to
accommodate
that
objection.
and
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
of
course,
you
can't
raise
for
the
first
time
in
court,
an
objection
you
might
have
raised
but
didn't
before
the
commission.
now,
if
the
court
is
prepared
to
overlook
that
procedure
or
obstacle,
there
might
be
two
possible
dispositions
to
this
case.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
yes,
the
commission
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
it
thought
it
was
and
it
was
never
advised
differently.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
it
might
well
be
wrong.
now
on
that
point,
our
position
would
be
this,
apart
from
the
fact
that
the
question
wasn't
raised
before
the
commission,
our
first
point
would
be
that
the
statute
requires
only
substantial
parity.
it
doesn't
require
absolute
parity.
and
the
fact
that
there
maybe
certain
marginal
types
of
shipment
which
once
in
a
blue
moon,
the
carrier
might
have
occasion
to
make,
should
not
invalidate
the
restriction.
we
think
that
most
of
the
examples
given
by
montgomery
in
its
brief
of
shipments
which
it
can't
make
now
but
could've
made
then
would
in
fact
be
authorized
under
a
liberal
construction
of
the
commission's
certificate
restriction.
for
example,
every
one
of
the
examples
that
involve
public
warehouses
and
that
makes
up
about
half
of
them,
would
probably
be
authorized
under
a
liberal
construction
of
the
types
of
businesses
referred
to
in
the
certificate
restriction.
but
if
the
court
disagrees
with
this,
if
the
court
thinks
that
the
statute
requires
absolute
parity
and
not
merely
substantial
parity,
we
think
the
proper
disposition
might
be
one
of
two
things.
first,
to
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
considerations
to
whether
in
fact
absolute
parity
is
provided
by
these
restrictions.
secondly,
a
remand
to
the
commission
with
instructions
to
modify
the
language
in
such
a
way
as
to
achieve
complete
parity,
in
other
words,
to
permit
every
kind
of
movement
which
the
shipper
--
which
the
carrier
might
have
made
under
its
contract
carrier
permit.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
yes,
that's
right.
the
commission
has
not
considered
the
objection
that
there
are
these
certain
types
of
movements
which
is
no
longer
may
make
but
could've
made
before--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
is
it
broader?
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
oh
yes,
yes,
it
certainly
does
in
one
relatively
minor
respect
and
in
one
very
major
respect.
in
a
minor
respect,
the
carrier
is
now
authorized
to
interchange
with
other
common
carriers
that
is
to
say
to
deliver
points
to
a
trans
--
deliver
goods
to
a
transfer
point
from
which
other
common
carriers
may
then
transport
it.
this
is
an
incident
of
common
carrier
status
the
commission
held
and
that
therefore
permitted
it
to
that
even
though
the
carrier
couldn't
have
done
that
as
a
contract
carrier.
but
there's
a
much
more
important
respect
in
which
the
certificate
broadens
the
authority
of
--
of
the
carrier.
our
contention
would
be
that
the
--
whatever
--
that
the
limitations
of
the
certificate
are
inherent
in
the
keystone
restrictions.
anything
that
the
carrier
would
be
barred
from
doing
under
the
certificate
limitations,
it
would
also
be
barred
from
doing
under
the
keystone
restrictions,
perhaps
if
there
were
appropriate
modifications
that
is
in
the
certificate
restriction.
but
the
converse
is
not
true.
the
certificate
restriction
does
not
confine
the
shipper
to
serving
only
those
persons
whom
it
was
authorized
to
contract
with
by
the
keystone
restriction.
because
for
example,
they
--
the
shipper
need
not
--
while
it
can
only
carry
goods
to
and
from
department
stores,
it
need
not
do
that
under
contract
with
department
stores.
it
may
also
do
that
on
behalf
of
persons
whose
--
whose
make
shipments
to
department
stores
or
who
receives
shipments
from
department
stores.
for
example,
manufacturers
or
wholesale
jobbers
or
other
kinds
of
suppliers
who
sell
to
department
stores
or
retail
specialty
shops
who
purchase
from
department
store
wholesalers
or
various
kinds
of
food
procedures
who
sell
to
packing
houses
and
they're
number
of
other
examples.
now
to
that
extent,
our
conception
of
the
statute
does
permit
in
expansion
of
the
carrier's
operating
rights,
but
it's
only
as
much
of
an
expansion
as
is
an
unavoidable
consequence
of
its
acquisition
of
common
carriers
status.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
yes,
it
does
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
yes.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
putting
aside
the
question
of
substantial
as
opposed
to
complete
parity,
putting
that
question
aside
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well
first
of
all,
from
the
language
of
the
statute
itself,
it
says,
"same
commodities,
same
points,
same
territories."
now,
that
means
parity
of
commodities,
parity
of
points
and
parity
of
territories.
now
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well
our
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
we
don't
derive
it
from
any
place
other
than
that
but
our
position
is
that
the
restrictions
which
we
have
imposed
here
comply
with
the
letter
of
the
statutory
mandate
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
--
because
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no,
but
that
isn't
what
we've
done
here
mr.
justice
goldberg
and
that
i
think
is
a
crucial
point.
the
commission
has
always
been
reluctant
to
place
in
common
carrier
certificates,
provisions
which
explicitly
limit
the
classes
of
customers
with
who
may
carry
or
may
deal
and
it
didn't
do
that
here.
but
if
the
restrictions
that
did
carry
over
into
this
certificate,
are
in
effect
territorial
restrictions.
they
were
called
that
by
the
district
court
and
they're
called
that
by
mr.
singer.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
between
retail
and
wholesale
esta
--
between
outlets
of
retail
and
wholesale
establishments.
now,
there's
ample
authority
for
the
imposition
of
highly
specialized
service
restrictions
of
this
kind
upon
common
carriers.
one
example
as
i
noted
before,
was
the
so-called
plant
site
restriction
which
authorizes
carriage
between
to
or
from
the
plant
site
of
a
particular
business
or
class
of
businesses.
in
effect,
that's
what
this
is.
but
another
closely
analogous
and
even
more
widely
used
type
of
limitation
is
the
so-called
intended
use
restriction.
now,
this
is
a
commodity
description
which
limits
the
carrier
to
carrying
commodities
which
are
identified
--
with
what
--
well,
to
carrying
commodities
which
have
actually
been
produced
or
distributed
by
a
particular
kind
of
business
or
which
are
intended
for
--
for
future
use
or
distribution
by
a
particular
kind
of
business.
now,
an
example
of
that
came
before
this
court
few
years
ago
in
the
andrew
nelson
case
in
355
u.s.
and
that
case
involved
a
contract
carrier
whose
permit
contained
a
commodity
description
referring
to
department
stores
stock
in
trade.
the
commission
held
in
this
court
and
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
clark,
agreed
that
that
phrase,
department
store
stock
in
trade
limited
the
carrier
to
carrying
goods
which
were
actually
intended
for
a
department
--
for
drugstore
rather,
drugstore
stock
in
trade.
not
merely
goods
which
are
the
general
type
that
drugstores
usually
deal
in.
well
that
case
involved
the
contract
carrier
and
therefore
is
not
authority
in
itself.
the
commission
has
imposed
similar
restrictions
and
literally
hundreds
of
cases
since
the
very
earliest
days
of
motor
carrier
regulation
upon
common
carriers.
and
they've
never
been
taught
inconsistent
with
common
carrier
status.
and
in
fact,
in
one
instance,
they
were
upheld
by
a
district
court
against
precisely
that
contention
in
a
decision
later
affirmed
per
curiam
by
this
court.
i
refer
to
the
morehouse
case
which
is
cited
at
page
32
of
our
brief.
now
with
this
intended
use,
commodity
descriptions
are
consistent
with
common
carrier
status
and
not
contrary
to
any
statutory
injunction,
so
are
the
point-to-point
or
territorial
limitations
which
the
commission
imposed
in
this
case.
even
though
they
do
have
the
indirect
effect
of
limiting
somewhat,
though
not
to
the
same
degree
as
the
keystone
restrictions,
the
classes
of
persons
with
whom
the
carrier
may
deal.
now
essentially,
turning
to
the
section
212
(c)
issue,
essentially,
what
the
commission
has
done
is
simply
to
make
explicit
in
the
common
carrier
certificate,
the
territorial
limitations,
the
point-to-point
or
movement
limitations,
which
are
implicit
in
the
keystone
restriction.
obviously,
section
212
(c)
contemplates
the
parity
of
some
sort
between
the
prior
and
future
operating
authorities,
and
the
only
question
is
whether
that's
a
parity
of
substance
or
parity
of
mere
form
or
language.
and
in
our
view,
it's
a
parity
of
substance.
the
substance
of
the
operating
rights
contained
in
the
contract
carrier
permit,
are
to
be
found
not
only
in
those
provisions
which
explicitly
refer
to
shipping
points
territories
and
commodities
but
also
in
the
keystone
restrictions
which
implicitly
impose
similar
restrictions.
for
example,
any
carrier
which
is
subject
to
a
keystone
restriction
limiting
it
to
dealing
with
department
stores
or
operating
under
contract
to
department
stores
will
in
practical
effect
be
limited
to
carrying
commodities
which
have
been
used
or
sold
or
which
are
intended
for
future
sale
or
use
by
a
department
store.
so
that
the
keystone
restriction
limits
the
carrier
to
precisely
the
same
extent
as
would
a
commodity
--
commodity
description
of
the
intended
use
variety.
by
the
same
token
of
the
keystone
restriction
also
limits
the
contract
carrier
to
the
same
degree
as
--
as
to
its
movements,
as
due
the
restrictions
which
were
imposed
by
the
commission
in
the
certificate
here.
now,
if
those
restrictions
had
been
explicit
in
the
contract
carrier
permit,
there
would
be
no
question
that
they
have
to
be
carried
over.
the
letter
of
the
statute
would
clearly
require
that
explicit
commodity
or
territorial
descriptions
in
the
contract
carrier
permit
be
carried
over.
and
we
think
they
should
be
no
less
transferable
merely
because
they're
only
implicit
in
the
keystone
restrictions
rather
than
explicit.
now,
the
consequence
of
rejecting
our
view
and
accepting
the
--
the
appellee's
view
would
be
an
enormous
expansion
of
the
operating
rights
of
this
contract
carrier.
standing
alone,
the
commodity
and
--
the
commodity
descriptions
are
certainly
broad
enough
to
authorize
the
transportation
of
almost
every
con
--
consumer
commodity
so
that
this
carrier
will
in
effect
become
a
general
common
carrier
of
general
commodities
for
all
commerce.
it
will
thereby
acquire
rights
which
are
greater
than
those
which
most
common
carriers
have,
and
it
will
have
acquired
them
without
ever
having
made
a
showing
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
such
as
this
required
of
common
carriers.
there's
no
evidence
we
think
that
cong
--
congress
intended
any
such
expansion
or
windfall.
two
considerations
i
think
bear
--
bear
that
out.
in
the
first
place,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
1957
amendments
was
to
prevent
crippling
encroachment
upon
the
business
of
common
carriers
by
contract
carriers.
under
the
original
statutory
definition,
many
contract
carriers
had
so
expanded
their
operations
that
some
of
them
had
100
or
even
more
contracts
and
were
really
competing
very
substantially
with
common
carriers
and
draining
off
traffic
from
them.
the
original
intent
at
least
as
the
commission
had
believed
it
was
that
these
contract
carriers
were
to
be
relatively
free
of
regulation
because
they
didn't
really
compete
on
any
broad
scale
with
common
carriers
or
threatened
their
economic
viability.
this
court
held
in
1956
that
commission
had
no
statutory
authority
to
place
a
ceiling
upon
the
number
of
contracts
into
which
a
contract
carrier
might
enter
or
to
prevent
the
common
contract
carrier
from
searching
aggressively
for
a
new
business
within
the
limits
of
its
permit.
it
was
for
that
reason
that
the
commission
went
to
congress
and
secured
new
legislation
which
would
limit
the
class
of
contract
carriers
and
prevent
this
encroachment.
senator
smathers
in
prevent
--
presenting
the
bill
of
--
to
the
--
the
senate,
explicitly
pointed
out
that
the
unlimited
diversion
of
traffic
from
common
to
contract
carriers
might
well
endanger
the
ability
of
the
common
carriers
to
render
adequate
service.
now,
we
think
it
would
be
completely
at
odds
with
that
statutory
progress
to
construe
this
grandfather
clause
as
tolerating
and
even
promoting
the
very
evil
which
congress
sought
to
cure.
and
well
it's
true
that
the
converted
contract
carrier
is
no
longer
free
of
regulation
as
he
was
before,
he
now
is
subject
to
the
same
regulation
as
any
other
common
carrier.
the
fact
remains
that
he
has
never
been
required
to
make
a
showing
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
and
for
that
reason
alone,
we
don't
think
that
congress
could've
intended
to
permit
this
tremendous
augmentation
of
his
operating
authority
at
the
expense
of
existing
common
carriers
who
had
made
such
a
showing.
and
the
second
reason
why
we
don't
think
congress
could
possibly
have
intended
this
tremendous
expansion
of
operating
rights
is
the
fact
that
this
is
a
grandfather
clause
repeatedly
referred
to
as
such
by
the
people
who
described
it
or
discussed
it
in
the
legislative
history.
the
other
grandfather
clauses
of
the
motor
carrier
act
had
been
construed
by
this
court
as
expressing
a
congressional
purpose
to
maintain
substantial
parity
between
the
prior
and
subsequent
operations
of
the
carrier
or
in
this
case,
operating
rights.
we
see
no
reason
why
this
grandfather
provision
should
be
construed
in
accordance
with
any
other
principle.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
there
is

difference
in
the
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
there
is
a
difference
in
the
language
but
i
think
it
relevant
to
point
out
that
this
very
congress
in
the
very
next
session,
the
very
next
year
in
1958,
would've
enacted
another
grandfather
clause
using
exactly
the
same
language
that
it
used
in
the
original
grandfather
clauses
of
the
motor
carrier
act,
described
that
grandfather
clause.
that
is
to
say
the
committee
reports
described
the
grandfather
clause
and
precisely
the
language
that
was
used
in
the
statute,
namely,
it
was
said
that
it
authorized
the
carrier
to
make
this
--
to
transport
the
same
commodities
between
the
same
points
and
within
the
same
territories
as
it
had
before.
so
we
think
these
shows
that
congress
simply
--
that
the
language
congress
used
in
section
212
(c)
was
just
its
way
of
saying,
this
is
a
grandfather
clause
which
is
to
be
construed
in
--
in
light
of
concept
of
substantial
parity.
thank
you.
