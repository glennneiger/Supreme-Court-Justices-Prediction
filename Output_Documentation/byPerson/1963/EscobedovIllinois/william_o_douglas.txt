i
thought
you
were
drawing
a
different
line
mr.
--
somewhat
like
the
line,
as
i
understand
it.
the
british
practice
that
the
police
had
stopped
a
person
on
the
street
engaged
in
conversation,
who
called
at
the
door
and
engaged
in
conversation,
that
this
right
to
advise
them
of
their
constitutional
rights
or
their
right
to
a
lawyer
arises
only
at
the
time
--
point
of
time
when
the
police
decide
to
hold
the
man,
to
arrest
the
him.
