justice

j.
brennan,

well,
is
that
to
say
that
--
then
he
--
then
he
charged
him
at
all,
was
--
that
they
could
be
the
judge
of
his
credibility
but
not
in
a
common
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
judge
was
around.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
judge
was
around.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
thompson,
may
i
ask
what
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
exactly
how
it's
done.
i
heard
you
say
just
now
that
the
evidence
that
the
judge
considers
on
the
question
of
voluntariness,
if
he
determines
that
the
confession
is
voluntary,
the
jury
hears
all
over
again
on
the
question
of
credibility.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
correct.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
the
very
same
evidence
that
he's
heard,
i
gather,
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
that
it?
now,
the
jury
now
hears,
i
suppose,
on
--
on
the
question
of
voluntariness,
the
defendant
must
take
a
stand
on
the
case,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
would
not,
on
the
issue
of
credibility,
if
it's
decided
that
he
was
not
to
take
the
stand,
i
suppose
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
actually
the
jury
may
hear
then
may
differ
in
these
respects.
if
the
defendant
has
taken
the
stand
before
the
judge
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury,
he
may
put
everything
else
in
before
the
jury
but
not
himself
take
the
stand,
i
take
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or,
i
take
it,
he
may,
on
the
issue
of
credibility,
in
addition
to
the
evidence
that
was
taken
before
the
judge,
also
introduce
more
evidence,
may
he
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he's
not
precluded
from
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what's
--
do
we
have
the
charge
in
this
instance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
in
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
on
a
standard
kind
of
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
was
--
no
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
--
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
trying
to
--
i'm
interested
in
getting
to
the
form
of
it.
my
state
practice
is
different
from
illinois
and
different
from
new
york
and
different
from
other
places.
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
what
you
do
in
illinois.
and
the
form
of
the
charge
is
what?
that
the
--
the
jury
now
--
the
confession
is
in,
all
these
additional
testimonies
were
taken.
they're
told
that
the
only
thing
you
have
to
consider
is
whether
this
is
a
trustworthy
confession
and
you
must
find
beyond
reasonable
doubt
that
it
is
or
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
only
goes,
i
gather,
to
the
general
burden
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
guilt.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that,
nevertheless,
the
jury
must
be
satisfied
that
it's
trustworthy,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
in
re?
is
that
baker?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
yes.
