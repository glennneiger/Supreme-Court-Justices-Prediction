mr.
barry
l.
kroll
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
once
again,
it
posses
the
problem
of
the
rights
of
the
individual
who
has
been
accused
by
the
police
of
participation
in
a
criminal
offense
and
who
has
been
taken
by
the
police
to
the
station,
the
rights
of
the
individual
to
the
consultation
or
to
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
as
opposed
to
the
right,
claimed
right
of
the
state
to
interrogate
him
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
judicial
or
non-judicial
admissions
to
be
used
as
evidence
against
him
in
the
event
of
a
trial.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
facts
of
the
case
may
be
stated
briefly.
they
are
not
too
difficult.
on
the
evening
of
january
19th,
the
petitioner's
brother-in-law
was
shot
in
the
garage
behind
his
home.
this
happened
about
midnight.
approximately
2:30
in
the
morning,
the
petitioner,
a
22-year-old
young
man
of
mexican
extraction,
a
married
man
whose
wife
was
pregnant,
was
arrested
by
the
police
with
a
boyfriend,
bobby
chan,
while
they
were
in
the
home
of
another
sister.
they
were
babysitting.
they
were
taken
by
eight
or
nine
policemen
to
the
fillmore
avenue
district
station
about
3
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
they
were
questioned
by
the
police
for
a
period
of
about
14
or
15
hours.
at
that
time,
danny
denied
any
knowledge
whatsoever
of
the
offense.
about
5
o'clock
that
evening,
attorney
warren
wolfson,
who
had
been
retained
by
danny
and
bobby
chan
in
connection
with
a
personal
injury
action
against
the
chicago
transit
authority
of
some
six
months
earlier,
appeared
at
the
police
station
and
pursuant
to
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
obtained
their
release.
on
january
30th
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
that's
right,
your
honor,
pursuant
to
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
on
january
30th,
a
saturday
evening,
about
8
o'clock,
danny
was
at
his
sister's
home,
his
--
the
widow
of
the
deceased.
at
that
time,
several
police
officers
came
with
warrants
for
the
arrest
of
danny
and
his
sister.
they
took
them
in
the
police
car,
whether
he
was
handcuffed
or
not
is
a
disputed
question
and
took
him
to
the
police
headquarters
at
(inaudible).
while
they
were
taking
danny
to
police
headquarters,
one
of
the
officers
said,
"we've
got
evidence
that
you
did
the
killing
or
somebody
says
that
you
shot
your
brother-in-law."
and
danny
denies
this.
he
states
either,
"i
don't
know
what
you
were
talking
about,"
is
danny's
statement
or
the
officer's
statement
is,
"well,
i'd
better
let
that
person
tell
me
that.
about
9
o'clock
or
so
or
9:30,
the
testimony
of
the
police
officers
is
in
conflict,
they
arrived
at
the
police
station.
danny
was
then
taken
to
one
room,
bobby
chan
taken
to
another.
by
the
way,
bobby
chan
had
been
rearrested
separately
and
was
placed
in
a
room
adjacent
to
danny.
bobby
chan
and
danny,
both
requested
to
be
allowed
to
consult
with
mr.
wolfson.
now,
mr.
wolfson
was
at
the
police
station.
he
had
been
informed,
the
record
is
silent
as
to
how,
that
danny
and
bobby
had
been
taken
there
but
nonetheless,
he
came
to
the
police
station.
he
asked
to
see
his
clients.
he
was
told,
"well,
they
haven't
been
here
very
long.
you
can't
see
them.
”he
was
told
by
one
police
officer
that
"you'll
have
to
see
somebody
else,"
and
he
was
shunted
around
from
one
detective
to
another
in
the
homicide
division.
ultimately,
he
got
to
captain
flynn.
he
wasn't
really
the
captain,
he
was
the
acting
captain,
but
all
the
officers
referred
to
him
as
“captain,”
sometimes
“lieutenant”
and
this
might
clear
up
some
question
as
to
his
rank,
he
was
the
officer-in-charge.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
the
detective
bureau
of
the
homicide
section.
captain
flynn
testifies
that
about
a
quarter
to
10
or
10
o'clock,
he
was
told
that
there
was
an
attorney
there
representing
escobedo
and
at
this
time,
captain
flynn
testified
he
had
no
knowledge
that
escobedo
was
in
the
station
and
he
had
no
knowledge
of
really
anything
that
had
happened
before,
but
the
attorney
came
up
to
captain
flynn
and
cited
the
illinois
statutes
asking
--
allowing
him
a
privilege
to
consult
with
his
client
and
captain
flynn
said,
“well,
they've
been
only
interrogating
him
for
a
short
time.
you
can't
see
him
now.
you
can
see
him
when
they're
finished
with
him,"
words
to
this
effect.
in
this
--
another
police
officer
who
heard
this
corroborates
captain
flynn's
testimony
and
there
really
is
no
question
but
that
the
captain
refused
mr.
wolfson's
request
to
consult
with
danny
and
bobby.
mr.
wolfson
was
not
content
with
this
rebuff
and
wanted
to
see
his
clients
as
he
felt
properly
so,
we
believe,
that
he
had
a
right
to.
and
he
went
down
to
a
desk,
which
fortunately
or
perhaps,
unfortunately,
was
adjacent
to
the
room
in
which
danny
was
being
kept
and
he
started
asking
the
desk's
sergeant
there
for
permission
to
see
danny
and
they,
through
happenstance,
were
overheard
by
danny
who
was
sitting
in
the
adjacent
room
and
the
door
was
ajar.
danny
saw
that
his
attorney
was
there
trying
to
see
him.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
10
days
after
his
original
arrest
and
release
on
habeas
corpus
petition.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
by
the
way,
danny
had
been
arrested,
but
had
not
been
charged
with
anything.
this
is
somewhat
similar
to
the
black
book
practice
which
was
held
to
be
questionable
in
the
haynes
case.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
this
was
all
before
the
confrontation,
your
honor.
danny
had
requested
to
see
his
attorney.
he
was
told,
one,
the
attorney
didn't
want
to
see
him
and
danny
heard
his
attorney
out
there
at
the
desk
asking
to
see
him.
danny
heard
the
officers
tell
the
attorney,
"you
can't
see
him
until
we're
done.
"he
heard
that
no
time
limit
was
set
and
in
fact,
the
police
officer
stated
that
there
was
no
time
limit
set
to
this
interrogation
and
the
attorney
would
be
prevented
from
talking
to
danny
until
the
interrogation
had
been
terminated.
now,
bobby
chan
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
well,
there
seems
to
be
some
question,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
in
that
we
presented
these
statutes
to
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
construed
these
statutes,
which
on
their
face
appear,
to
give
the
man
the
right,
unless
there's
escape
or
some
other
possibility
like
that.
the
illinois
court
said
that
these
statutes
do
not
evidence
an
intention
to
insulate
the
state
from
the
questioning.
they
said
they
--
there
is
no
right
to
immediate
access
despite
the
language
of
the
statute.
this
is
one
of
the
holdings
of
the
case
below
that
the
statutes
do
not
actually
grant
the
rights
that
this
court
previously
referring
to
them
in
footnotes
in
the
guam
case
and
the
crooker
case,
this
court
thought
that
illinois
had
granted,
under
their
statutes,
this
right,
but
apparently,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
held
that
the
right
is
not
absolute.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
well,
the
--
there
as
only
one
appeal,
your
honor.
the
case
was
first
argued
and
thereafter,
about
four
months
later,
an
opinion
was
published
in
which
they
reversed
the
conviction
apparently
on
the
grounds
that
the
state
did
not
prove
the
voluntariness.
thereafter,
the
state
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
which
was
granted.
it
was
heard
solely
on
briefs
and
the
ultimate
opinion
was
promulgated
in
which
the
court
held,
one,
that
they
did
not
find
a
voluntariness
question
sufficient
to
reverse
and
two,
that
the
denial
of
counsel
was
insufficient
to
--
to
render
this.
this
superseded
the
first
opinion
and
under
illinois
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
pardon?
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
justice
house
wrote
the
final
opinion
and
this
superseded
the
original
opinion
and
under
illinois
law,
that
opinion
is
merely
one
that
apparently
never
has
any
efficacy,
there
having
been
granted
a
rehearing.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
he
had
indicated
that
he
would
file
a
dissent,
but
when
the
rehearing
was
granted,
whatever
his
dissent
was,
apparently,
it
became
the
opinion
of
the
entire
court.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
no
dissents,
your
honor.
and
we
could
speculate
as
to
the
reasons
but
that
would
be
beyond
our
province.
now
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
--
crooker
versus
california
five
years
ago.
in
the
case
of
crooker
versus
california,
some
of
the
problems
were
similar
and
some
were
dissimilar.
in
that
case,
the
petitioner,
a
college
graduate
who
had
one
year
of
law
school,
was
picked
up
by
the
police
and
at
the
beginning
of
his
interrogation
requested
that
he
be
allowed
to
call
an
attorney
for
the
purpose
of
arranging
to
have
that
attorney
represent
him
if
possible.
the
police
officers
of
california
refused
this
request
and
thereafter
--
after
a
period
of
questioning
which
lasted
some
15
hours,
the
petitioner
gave
a
statement
which
was
then
introduced
in
evidence.
this
court
held
that
the
admission
of
that
statement
into
evidence
did
not
violate
that
petitioner's
right
to
due
process.
in
so
doing,
this
court
laid
down
the
standard
that
it's
definitely
agreed
that
the
refusal
of
the
right
to
consult
with
counsel
is
one
of
the
factors
to
be
considered.
but,
in
the
crooker
case,
this
court
found
that
because
of
the
petitioner's
experience
and
education,
because
of
his
obvious
knowledge
of
his
rights,
he
had
told
the
people
that,
“well,
the
lie
detector
test
you
plan
to
give
me
won't
be
admissible
unless
i
stipulate
to
it.”
this
court
held
that
the
presumption
of
voluntariness
was
overcome
by
the
circumstances.
thus,
this
court,
in
that
case,
held
that
the
totality
of
circumstances
must
be
looked
at
and
under
the
totality
in
the
crooker
case,
they
found
that
there
was
no
prejudice,
that
the
statement
did
not
flow
from
the
refusal
of
the
right
to
consult
with
counsel.
there
was
a
vigorous
dissent,
to
which
i
have
averted
in
my
brief.
it
is
our
contention
today
that
either
of
two
propositions
should
be
announced.
one,
that
under
the
standard
set
forth
in
the
crooker
case,
as
applied
to
the
factual
complex
of
this
case
that
the
requirements
of
crooker
have
been
complied
with
and
that
the
statement
under
the
totality
of
circumstances
has
been
shown
to
be
the
result
of
--
as
justice
frankfurter
said
in
rogers
versus
richmond,
constitutionally
impermissible
methods
or
as
stated
in
the
haynes
case,
whether
this
was
the
--
not
voluntary
whether
it
was
the
result
of
the
interrogation.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
the
cicenia
case
is
a
harder
case
to
distinguish.
the
cicenia
case,
it
would
appear
that
the
sole
aspect
that
was
there
present
was
that
the
young
man
had
been
told
by
his
attorney
to
turn
himself
in
and
then
he
had
asked
to
be
allowed
to
consult
with
him.
and
the
attorney
had
requested
also,
but
it
appeared
that
there
was
no
claim
of
overreaching
during
the
period
of
interrogation.
there
was
no
claim
made
that
he
would
not
have
confessed
but
for
the
detention.
there
was
no
showing
how
this
refusal
to
allow
him
to
consult
worked
to
his
disadvantage.
in
our
case,
we
have
a
young
man
who
was
denied
the
right
to
consult
with
his
counsel.
this
is
common.
we
have
a
young
man
who
was
failed
to
be
advised
of
his
constitutional
rights.
the
state's
attorney,
who
ultimately
took
the
question-and-answer
court
reporter
statement
which
was
a
practice
that
was
questioned
in
the
spano
case,
the
state's
attorney
admitted
that
he
didn't
advise
the
man
of
his
right
to
have
counsel
or
of
his
rights
not
to
give
a
statement.
and
although
the
--
the
petitioner
was
informed
by
his
attorney,
advised,
“don't
say
anything,”
he
--
there
is
no
showing
in
the
record
that
he
was
advised
that
he
had
a
right
not
to
say
anything.
and,
indeed,
he
was
lead
to
be
--
to
understand
by
the
denial
of
the
police
of
his
attorney's
request
that
he
really
didn't
have
this
right
because
here
was
the
attorney,
to
his
own
sight,
attempting
to
see
him
and
he
hears
the
police
tell
the
attorney,
“you
can't
see
the
man.”
so,
what
we
have
here
is
a
man
who
wasn't
told
of
his
rights
and
if
he
would
--
had
been
told
of
his
rights
by
the
attorney,
which
is
a
grave
question,
he
was
shown
by
the
police
that
they
weren't
going
to
accommodate
his
rights,
that
they
were
going
to
refuse
him.
we
held
the
fact
that
he
was
--
seeing
by
writ
--
by
successive
police
officers,
starting
from
three
police
who
picked
him
up
and
told
him,
“you
might
as
well
confess.
we've
got
the
goods
on
you.”
he
was
seen
by
an
elderly
police
officer
when
he
arrived
at
the
station.
he
was
seen
by
three
or
four
different
police
officers,
among
whom
was
this
officer
montejano.
he
was
confronted
with
a
person
who
accused
him
of
having
committed
the
offense
and
even
the
state
admits
or
their
theory
is
that
danny
never
committed
the
actual
offense.
that
danny
was
a
mere
accessory
before
the
fact
and
that
he
had
counseled
the
commission
of
this
murder.
but
they
told
him,
“well,
we've
got
a
man
here
who
says
you
did
it.”
this
is
similar
to
the
bram
situation
where
he
was
placed
in
a
situation
of
almost
being
forced
by
the
nature
of
the
accusation
against
him
to
either
--
to
make
some
sort
of
statement
and
almost
lead
to
believe
that,
“you're
not
going
to
see
your
attorney
until
you
do
cooperate,”
which
is
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
the
other
person
or
it
ap
--
we
do
not
know.
the
other
person
was
not
called
as
a
witness
nor
was
his
statement
introduced
in
evidence.
the
police
officers
all
stated
that
this
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
this
is
a
matter
of
fact
that
there
is
evidence
that
he
did
say
it
and,
when
he
was
confronted
with
the
petitioner,
he
told
the
petitioner,
“you
did
it.”
now,
the
petitioner
knew
that
he
didn't
do
it.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
chan
--
chan
was
represented
by
an
attorney
who
made
a
motion
to
suppress,
and
chan's
confession
was
suppressed
by
the
trial
court.
the
judge
who
re
--
suppressed
chan's
confession
said,
“well,
there
is
a
distinction."
danny
observed
that
the
lawyer
was
there.
chan
didn't
know
that
the
lawyer
as
there
and
therefore,
there's
a
distinction.
now,
we
submit
that
the
distinction
works
the
other
direction.
but
chan's
statement
was
suppressed
and
he
was
not
repressed
by
the
state
and
he
has
never
been
proceeded
against.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
escobedo's
motion
to
suppress
was
denied
and
that
denial
is
what
we
are
questioning
here.
this
is
the
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
wolfson
represented
both
chan
and
escobedo
at
the
police
station.
this
was
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
had
represented
them
as
their
personal
injury
attorney.
however,
at
the
trial,
chan
was
represented
by
a
permanent
chicago
criminal
defense
attorney
and
escobedo
was
represented
by
the
public
defender's
office
and
has
been
represented
on
--
on
appeal
as
an
indigent
by
appointment
of
counsel,
both
at
the
illinois
supreme
court
level
and
we
have
carried
it
through.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
he
--
he
seems
to
draw
a
two-fold
distinction.
he
says
that
chan
did
not
know
that
his
attorney
was
there.
and
danny
did
know
and
therefore,
danny
must
have
been
reassured
because
he
knew
his
attorney
was
at
the
station.
the
trial
judge
also
made
the
observation
that,
“you
appear
to
be
a
pretty
bright
lad.
you
appear
to
be
pretty
sharp.”
although
it's
interesting
to
note
that
at
the
same
time
he
says,
“you
appear
to
be
pretty
sharp”,
he
says,
“i
don't
know
how
old
you
are.”
and
this
was
the
judge
who
had,
just
a
few
moments
earlier,
asked
the
boy
how
hold
he
is
and
he
says,
“i'm
22,
your
honor.”
but
the
judge
forgets
this
and
he
says,
“i
don't
know
how
old
you
are,
but
you're
pretty
sharp.”
now,
unfortunately,
the
record
does
not
contain
any
reference
to
danny's
educational
background
and
we
do
not
have
that
before
us
at
this
time.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
that
is
my
second
position,
your
honor,
yes.
i
believe
that
is
the
position
of
the
dissenting
justices
in
the
crooker
case
and
i
believe
that
that
is
the
position
which
should
be
adopted
in
this
case.
and
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
well,
i
--
i've
--
i
first
believe
that
the
totality
of
circumstances
in
this
case,
such
as
in
the
spano
case
and
the
(inaudible)
case,
would
allow
the
reversal
on
the
ground
that
the
evident
--
the
statement
was
obtained
out
of
a
totality
which
rejected
his
rights.
but
i
would
also
say
that
if
we
wish
to
get
to
the
second
issue
that
the
man,
even
if
there
weren't
these
other
circumstances,
that
the
man
who,
in
this
case,
had
an
attorney.
and
in
this
case,
the
attorney
was
at
the
station.
under
chandler
versus
fretag,
he
has
an
absolute
right
to
this
attorney.
he
was
not,
as
in
crooker,
asking
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
well,
it
--
i
was
a
little
troubled
when
reading
crooker
and
then
cicenia
because
crooker
was
the
case
that
was
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
i
could
not
--
it
seemed
that
if
the
holding
had
been
in
cicenia,
crooker
was
an
a
fortiori
holding.
but
the
--
there
was
no
attempt
made
in
all
due
deference,
to
say
how
the
more
aggravating
factors
in
the
cicenia
case
fell
under
the
crooker
rule.
the
crooker
rule
said,
“we
don't
find
any
prejudice
because
of
this
man's
background.”
the
cicenia
case
merely
said,
“no
violation
crooker.”
but,
the
cicenia
case
had
absent
these
factors
which
were
the
persuasive
ones
in
crooker.
i
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
there
is
no
--
no
record
of
that
in
the
cicenia
case.
that
came
up
on
a
habeas
corpus
matter
and
there
appears
to
be
no
evidence
one
way
or
the
other.
in
this
case
there
is
an
affirmative
statement
by
the
state's
attorney
that
he
didn't
warn
him
and
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
any
of
the
police
officers
ever
warned
him.
this
is
similar
to
the
gallegos
case
where
it
was
held
that,
with
that
accused,
the
mere
fact
that
no
one
told
him
of
his
rights
was
sufficient
to
invalidate
his
confession.
and
that
appeared,
as
mr.
justice
clark
pointed
out
in
the
dissent,
to
be
the
only
factor
that
just
no
one
told
him
of
his
rights
and,
yet,
that
was
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
he
was
a
14-year-old
boy
who
was
taken
to
the
--
to
the
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
juvenile
place
of
detention,
and
that
was
the
--
there
was
no
coercive
circumstances
as
there
are
here.
here,
a
man
is
told
that,
“you
can't
see
your
attorney
who
wants
to
see
you.
your
attorney
who
had
told
you
what
to
do
when
you
get
to
the
station."
he
said,
"if
the
police
picked
you
up,
be
very
polite
and
tell
them
my
attorney
told
me
not
to
speak
to
you
until
i
get
a
chance
to
consult
with
him",
and
he
did
this.
and,
what
did
the
police
do?
in
his
presence,
they
kicked
him
--
his
attorney
out.
in
his
presence,
they
told
the
attorney,
“you
can't
see
him
until
we're
finished.”
in
his
presence
they
said,
“you
can
see
him
when
he's
--
when
we're
finished
with
him.”
and
we'll
be
--
and
no
time
limit
was
set.
this
is
a
--
a
case
where
this
accused
was
allowed
to
be
in
a
police
station
unfriended
by
anybody
and
the
only
evidence
connecting
him
with
the
crime
is
this
statement.
the
police
were
not
attempting
to
solve
a
crime.
the
police
had
information
that
he
had
--
he
was
the
man
who
did
it,
although
the
information
proved
false,
they
thought
they
knew
who
it
was.
so,
they
picked
up
the
man
who
--
against
whom
the
finger
had
been
pointed
and
what
do
they
try
to
do?
they
try
and
get
the
only
piece
of
evidence
that
leads
to
his
conviction.
they
don't
try
to
get
proof.
they
manufacture
a
piece
of
evidence.
now,
i
don't
mean
they
go
out
and
dream
something
up.
but
prior
to
bringing
the
man
in,
they
had
no
evidence
against
him,
at
least
there
was
none
that
they
introduced.
after
this
interrogation,
they
had
a
piece
of
evidence
which
the
state
court
termed
the
highest
investees,
a
voluntary
confession.
now,
he
convicted
himself
in
that
police
station
under
an
accusatorical
--
accusatorial
system.
he
convicted
himself
as
a
result
of
the
interrogation
that
went
on
there.
he
convicted
himself,
and
what
did
the
attorney
do
thereafter?
what
could
he
do?
the
focus
of
the
trial
has
now
shifted
from,
instead
of
being
one
to
determine
his
guilt
or
innocence,
the
whole
focus
of
the
trial
was
now
shifted
to
determine
whether
this
piece
of
evidence
which
was
created
in
the
police
station
was
now
admissible
or
not.
in
--
in
the
case
--
we
feel
that,
in
order
to
have
the
effect
of
assistance
of
counsel,
you've
got
to
have
the
assistance
at
the
time
you
need
it.
now,
once
this
boy
gave
his
confession,
a
day-and-a
half
later,
he
was
arraigned.
once
the
boy
gave
his
confession,
there
was
absolutely
nothing
this
attorney
could
do.
they
tried
their
best
but
the
police
officers
just
denied
that
anything
untoward
happened
and
the
state
supreme
court
felt
that
they
could
not
overturn
this
finding
and,
therefore,
they're
bound
by
it.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
it's
the
state
exhibit
1,
your
honor,
page
75
in
the
print.
it
--
it's
partially
abstracted.
the
entire
statement,
as
it
appears
in
the
record,
is
question-and-answer.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
well,
not
here.
i
--
we
still
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
that's
what
he
testified
at
the
trial,
your
honor.
he
said
--
he
stated
that
whatever
i
said
in
there
is
not
true.
i
said
what
the
policeman
told
me
to
say.
and,
if
we
wish
to
get
into
that,
he
testified
as
to
the
reasons
that
he
had
promises
made
to
him
and
various
other
things
which
of
course
the
police
denied.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
i
--
i
don't
see
the
point
of
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
well,
we
--
we
cite
this
as
being
controverted
facts
which,
if
believed,
are
clearly
coercive
under
the
lynumn
case.
but
the
state
has
argued
and
--
with
some
apparent
merit
that
this
court
is
bound
by
the
factual
determination
below.
now,
if
under
the
language
of
the
haynes
case
this
court
can
weigh
the
factors.
i
think
that
you
can
clearly
come
to
the
conclusion
that
these
premises
were
made.
but,
this
is
another
feature
of
the
reason
why
we
have
to
have
an
attorney
there.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
judge
slater,
the
trial
judge.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
no,
your
honor,
the
jury
was
told
that
this
confession
has
to
be
considered
as
competent
evidence
and
you
cannot
disregard
it.
but
they
were
told
that
the
evidence
adduced
as
to
the
--
evidence
adduced
as
to
the
circumstances
surrounding
it,
you
can
weigh
as
to
its
trustworthiness,
but
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
this
issue
was
not
submitted
to
the
jury,
your
honor.
illinois
does
not
have
the
stein
rule
as
the
new
york
case
does.
in
illinois,
the
admissibility
of
the
confession
is
a
matter
for
the
court
and
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
no,
your
honor.
in
illinois,
this
is
just
a
question
of
admissibility
and
the
jury
was
told
that
you
have
to
consider
this
as
competent
evidence.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
the
issue
was
not
raised
to
the
trial
--
to
the
jury.
the
jury
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
he
gave
it
to
them
as
a
statement
which
you
are
obliged
to
consider
that
you
cannot
disregard
the
statement.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
a
fairly
good
statement
of
the
rule
in
illinois.
your
honors,
i
have
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
certainly.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
the
--
the
ultimate
written
statement
was
in
question-and-answer
form.
the
state's
attorney
had
been
called
and
the
state's
attorney,
with
a
state's
attorney
court
report,
appeared
at
the
police
station
and
he
took
statements
from
chan,
digerlando,
and
escobedo,
all
three
of
the
boys
involved.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
well,
the
statement
that
was
introduced
was
the
question-and-answer
statement
which
was
unsigned
and
the
defendant
refused
to
sign
it.
it's
interesting.
on
monday
morning,
when
he
was
presented
with
the
transcript,
he
refused
to
sign
it
stating
that,
“you
didn't
come
through
with
your
promises.”
but
--
he
didn't
sign
it
so
it
was
ad
--
admitted
as
the
court
re
--
as
embodying
the
court
reporter's
testimony
that
this
is
a
transcription
of
what
occurred
saturday
night
at
the
police
station.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
yes,
your
honor.
it's
--
its
abstracted
and
printed
in
part
and
the
full
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
the
full
statement
is
in
the
record
which
was
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
yes.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
well
the
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
it's
abstracted
in
part
and
question-and-answer
in
part.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
but
the
full
statement
does
appear
in
the
complete
record.
we
didn't
think
the
substance
of
the
statement
would
come
up,
so
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
he
testified
he
did
not.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
the
attorney
--
the
--
escobedo's
attorney
testified
that
someone
had
put
in
a
call
to
a
state's
attorney's
office
and
they
told
him
--
they
gave
him
the
wonderful
advise
of,
“get
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.”
of
course,
this
was
saturday
night,
11
o'clock
at
night,
but
they
said,
“get
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.”
he
was
able
to
do
it
a
week
earlier
on
a
thursday
evening
but,
on
a
saturday
evening,
he
said
that
the
state's
attorney
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
pardon?
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
well,
apparently,
the
state
felt
there
were
no
judges
because
they
didn't
arraign
the
man.
they
kept
him
in
here
and
didn't
take
him
over
to
(inaudible)
court
until
monday
and
i
presume,
the
same
judge
who
had
a
writ
--
issued
the
habeas
corpus
would
also
have
the
arraignment.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
right.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
right.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
no,
that
--
that's
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
this
case
is
--
is
unique,
in
that,
many
of
the
police
officers
all
testified
as
to
what
they
didn't
do
when
each
of
them
con
--
conflict
to
each
others
as
to
what
actually
happened
but
they
all
deny
the
allegations
that
danny
made.
this
is
another
reason
why
we
feel
that
the
attorney
should
be
there.
danny
makes
specific
allegations
and
each
of
the
managers
denied
that
they
did
it.
these
things
just
don't
lie
true,
but
we're
precluded
somewhat
from
that
issue
with
this.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
that's
right.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
that's
right,
your
honor.
unfortunately
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
cicenia,
crooker,
groban,
and
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
that's
right,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
if
you
test
this
case
for
prejudice,
you
will
find
prejudice.
the
state's
brief
concludes
with
the
concession.
to
be
sure,
they
say
danny
escobedo
would
not
have
confessed
had
he
been
allowed
to
consult
with
his
attorney
at
the
police
station.
the
state
candidly
admits
this
in
their
brief.
danny
escobedo
would
not
have
confessed
had
he
been
allowed
to
consult
with
his
attorney.
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
well,
that
--
mr.
barry
l.
kroll
that's
further
the
right,
mr.
justice
clark.
i
might
point
out
that
in
their
reply,
the
state
has
taken
each
of
these
circumstances
and
attempted
to
isolate
it
and
say,
“well,
this,
by
itself,
wasn't
so
bad
or
this
really
didn't
happen
or
such
and
such.”
but
we
don't
look
at
each
circumstance
in
isolation.
we
look
at
the
totality
of
circumstance
and
what
we
have
here
is
a
lad
who
goes
into
the
police
interrogation
and
tells
him,
“i'm
not
going
to
say
anything
until
my
--
i
see
my
attorney.”
and
some
two
or
three
hours
or
an
hour-and-a
half
or
whatever
it
is
later,
lo
and
behold
there's
a
statement.
something
happened
there.
it
wasn't
his
first
inclination
to
confess,
even
questioned
a
week-previous
for
13
hours
and
made
no
incriminating
statements
but
he
comes
back
on
saturday
night.
he's
arrested,
hauled
into
the
police
station
and,
thereafter,
a
statement
is
obtained.
we
feel
that
whatever
happened
there,
the
statement
is
not
voluntary.
and
whether
we
say
it's
a
result
of
counsel
or
result
of
incommunicado,
or
a
result
of
many
police
officers,
or
a
result
of
the
confrontation,
or
a
result
of
the
alleged
promises,
or
a
result
of
the
fact
that
this
lad
was
a
22-year-old
person
of
spanish
extraction
whose
mentally
was
not
so
great,
whose
education
doesn't
appear,
or
a
combination
of
these
factors.
whatever
we
have,
it's
clear
that
the
statement
was
a
result
of
what
happened
at
the
police
station
and
therefore,
not
voluntary.
i've
allowed
the
american
civil
liberties
union
a
portion
of
my
