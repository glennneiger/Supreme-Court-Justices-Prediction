justice
hugo
l.
black
this
was
before
the
confrontation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
--
you
mean
by
that
that
it
completely
involved
and
has
disputed
the
evidence
on
the
constitutional
question
of
this
kind
as
to
who
has
got
the
power
to
protect
his
constitutional
rights
that
the
jury
had
evidence
to
see
whether
it
believes
it
was
correctly
exercised.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
deny
that
court
has
that
power?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
cannot
come
to
its
own
conclusion
as
to
what
was
decided.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
the
court
could
--
are
you
saying
that
the
court
could
or
could
not
in
order
to
protect
his
constitutional
right,
determine
the
truth
of
the
issue
upon
himself,
contrary
to
the
determination
made
below?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
(inaudible)
--
do
your
state
(inaudible)
follow
a
rule,
much
different
than
these
other
two
criminal
cases
can
only
require
that
it
would
be
established
on
state
by
a
few
hundred
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
we
decided
on
the
basis
of
what
--
well,
it's
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
care
about
your
proof
of
evidence
in
a
criminal
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
isn't
it
a
question
of
voluntariness?
doesn't
the
jury
--
does
a
jury
in
having
credibility
in
evidence
have
a
right
to
consider
how
that
evidence
is
given
whether
it
was
given
under
circumstances
that
might
impair
its
credibility?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
fall
(inaudible)
to
voluntariness?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
how
you
--
however
it's
phrased,
as
you
--
has
illinois
taken
away
from
the
jury
the
right
to
have
proven
the
satisfaction
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
his
confession
is
voluntary
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
jury
does
have
a
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
has
to
be
proven
to
the
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
then
i
do
not
understand
why
the
--
why
it
said
that
the
jury
does
not
pass
on
it
at
all
and
why
it
can
be
said
that
it
can
be
shunted
off
to
a
trial
judge
who
decided
on
the
pre
(inaudible)
of
the
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
it's
left
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
consideration.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
jury
then
have
the
right
to
hear
the
evidence
and
how
it
was
produced?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
it's
voluntary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
the
defendant
offer
evidence
attacking
this
to
show
that
it
was
coerced?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
it
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
burden
then
is
on
the
judge
--
state
to
prove
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
the
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
does
that
not
include
every
essential
thing
offered
to
the
jury
as
evidence
to
convict
the
defendant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
if
--
that
the
rule
is
that
there
are
some
things
that
are
essential
to
convict
the
defendant,
production
of
evidence,
but
the
jury
doesn't
have
a
right,
the
jury
is
not
bound,
protected
by
the
reasonable
doubt
doctrine?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
does
not
include
anything
but
the
ultimate
question
of
guilt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
depending
--
depending
on
what
the
facts
are.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
who's
the
ultimate
trier
of
facts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
jury?
justice
hugo

(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)
justice

that
is

of
