would
you

are
you
saying
the

is
not
a

well,
isn't
the

aren't
these
facts
that
the
officer
told
him
to
say
something
and
gave

a
promise
part
of
your
argument?
justice

well,
does
this
say
--
who

who
finally
ruled
on
the
admissibility
of
his
confession?
justice

was
the
admission

was
the
vol

or
is
that
just

the
abstract.
justice

i

justice

did
the
state's
attorney
who
took
the
statement
know
that
the
lawyer
had
been
refused
admission
or
was
being
refused
to

to

to

escobedo?
justice

yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
urged
--
i
gathered
your
position
was
in
your
brief
that
it's
just
not
the
opportunity
to
consult
with
counsel
prior
to
interrogation
but
requiring
his
actual
presence
all
during
the
interrogation.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
is
the
position
you
take?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
your
cont
--
the
constitutional
rule
you
proposed,
it
entirely
cite
from
the
predictions
of
what
the
consequences
be,
what
constitutional
rule
do
you
propose?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
a
lawyer
is
required
to
be
present
during
the
interrogation
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
thompson,
when
the
state
offers
a
--
the
judge's
rule
that
it
is
admissible,
the
state
offers
the
confession
and,
before
the
jury,
it
offers
it
and
i
suppose
they
offer
it
through
a
--
through
someone
who
heard
him
make
it
since
he
didn't
sign
it
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
--
the
court
reporter
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
like
in
this
case.
but
the
--
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned,
that's
all
the
evidence
it
wants
to
get
in
about
a
confession,
and
if
the
defendant
wants
to
put
something
else
and
it
goes
to
the
weight
of
the
trustworthiness
of
the
confession,
it
may
pursue
the
matter
further.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
would
it
ref
--
it
might
pursue
it
on
a
cross-examination
of
the
reporter,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
might
do
it
that
way
if
it
wanted,
then
on
--
but
that
would
be
all
it
could
do
on
the
state's
side
of
the
case,
is
cross-examine
the
reporter.
justice
byron
r.
white
then,
on
his
side
of
the
case,
if
he
wanted
to
call
witnesses
to
prove
involuntariness,
he
could,
not
to
prove
involuntariness
but
to
show
the
fact
going
to
trustworthiness.
but
now,
if
he
testified
that
if
--
if
he
did
that,
if
he
pursued
the
matter
of
--
on
his
side
of
the
case
and
if
he
had
testified
that
the
preliminary
hearing
before
the
judge
could
the
state
introduce
his
testimony
before
the
judge?
because
i
assume,
at
the
preliminary
hearing
before
the
judge,
the
state
has
an
unlimited
right
to
cross-examine.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
are
the
--
any
admissions
that
he
might
make
at
that
hearing
admissible
against
him
at
the
--
later
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
before
the
jury
(voice
overlap)
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
if
--
so
that
if
--
if
the
same
rule
applied
to
coerced
confession
hearings,
your
system
allows
him
to
testify
about
voluntariness
but
he
not
--
but
the
evidence
--
that
evidence
does
not
reach
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
cross-ex
--
his
cross-examination
does
not
reach
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
he
takes
the
stand
at
his
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
before
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
he
pursues
it
on
his
side
of
the
case,
introduces
other
witnesses
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
states
that
he
ought
to
have
his
own
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
and
a
needful
benefit.
