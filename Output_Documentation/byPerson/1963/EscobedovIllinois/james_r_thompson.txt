mr.
james
r.
thompson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
and
counsel.
this
case
involves
the
crime
of
murder
for
hire,
the
defendant
before
the
court,
daniel
escobedo,
being
the
one
who
counseled
the
commission
of
murder
for
hire
by
his
codefendant,
benedict
digerlando.
he
was
found
guilty
by
a
jury
and
sentenced
by
that
jury
to
a
term
of
20
years
in
illinois
state
penitentiary.
there
are
two
issues
here.
first,
whether
or
not
under
all
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
the
confession
of
escobedo
to
the
state's
attorney,
at
about
11:50
pm
on
the
night
that
he
was
arrested
for
the
last
time
was
voluntary
or
as
sometimes
i
think
put
in
the
brief
and
the
argument
here
whether
under
the
totality
of
circumstances
he
might
have
been
overreached
or
whether
under
the
totality
of
circumstances,
there
was
fundamental
unfairness
because
of
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
number
of
factors.
and
the
second
issue
specifically
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
in
all
the
briefs
and
upon
which
this
court
granted
certiorari
was
whether
or
not
the
absence
of
counsel
or
the
refusal
to
allow
the
defendant
to
consult
with
counsel
before
he
confessed
compels
by
itself
the
exclusion
of
the
confession
and
whether
or
not
crooker
versus
california
and
cicenia
versus
lagay
should
be
overruled.
now,
as
to
the
first
issue,
i
think
the
discussion
of
the
various
factors
which
the
defendant
says
go
to
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
are
fairly
well
done
in
detail
in
the
brief.
let
me
go
at
once
to
some
of
the
questions
raised
by
your
honors
during
the
argument
of
opposing
counsel.
i
think
the
first
one
that
ought
to
be
dealt
with
is
whether
or
not
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
haynes
against
washington,
the
latest
confession
case
to
be
handed
down
by
this
court.
i
think
that
it
is,
for
several
reasons.
first,
i
think
we're
only
forced
to
even
approach
a
haynes
versus
washington
kind
of
situation
because
of
the
first
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
in
this
case.
if
there
had
been
no
first
opinion
in
this
case,
i
think
it
pretty
clear
that
we
would
not
need
to
discuss
haynes
and
its
applicability
at
all.
but
there
was
a
first
opinion
and
that
first
opinion
did
find
or
conclude,
one
judge
dissenting
an
opinion
to
follow,
that
promises
were
made
to
escobedo
that
if
he
confessed
he
would
be
used
only
as
a
witness
and
allowed
to
go
home.
now
if
that
was
true,
if
the
evidence
in
the
record
supports
that
position
and
that
finding,
then
there
is
no
question
but
that
that
confession
could
not
be
used
under
the
rule
of
haynes
and
under
the
rule
of
lynumn.
there's
no
dispute
about
that
at
all.
the
central
question
now,
it
seems
to
me,
is
whether
or
not
there
was
any
evidentiary
support
for
the
finding
of
the
first
opinion
or
whether
we
must
confine
ourselves
solely
to
the
conclusions
of
the
second
opinion
which
is
after
all
the
official
opinion
now
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
which
we
review
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
first
opinion
found
evidences
of
promises
or
could
have
found
evidences
of
promises
only
by
believing
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
on
a
motion
to
suppress
and
disbelieving
the
only
officer
to
whom
promises
were
attributed,
officer
montejano.
now,
i
don't
need
to
cite
the
decisions
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
or
indeed
the
decisions
of
any
state
supreme
court
for
the
proposition
that
on
review,
courts
of
review
will
not
reweigh
questions
of
credibility.
in
their
brief
in
this
court,
the
defendant
has
conceded
that
promises
were
specific
or
said
that
promises
were
specifically
made
by
montejano
and
has
conceded
that
specific
denials
were
given
by
montejano.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
no.
the
petitioners
take
the
view
in
this
court,
although
it
wasn't
delimited
very
much
in
oral
argument,
as
i
understand
their
brief
in
their
original
petition
for
certiorari,
that
you
can
reweigh
facts
and
find
as
a
fact
something
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
not
find
as
a
fact.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
think
that
the
--
the
true
rule
of
this
court's
power
on
certiorari
and
weighing
evidence
and
confession
cases
is
that
the
--
this
court
can
look
to
the
undisputed
fact
in
the
record
and
come
into
a
different
constitutional
conclusion
than
the
court
below
did
on
the
same
facts.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
i
--
i
wouldn't
say
that
this
court
could
say,
contrary
to
the
illinois
supreme
court,
that
they
believe
petitioner
and
they
don't
believe
officer
montejano,
unless
there
were
sufficient
other
evidence
in
the
record
to
make
it
clear
that
montejano
was
lying.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
this
court
has
the
power,
in
order
to
protect
the
constitutional
rights
of
a
defendant
to
find
what
it
believes
to
be
the
facts.
but,
if
the
only
basis
upon
which
this
court
would
find
to
be
a
fact
is
that
they
believe
the
testimony
of
one
defendant,
whereas,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
believe
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer
and
all
you
had
was
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
on
one
side
and
the
police
officer
on
the
other
side.
and
this
court
was
simply
coming
to
a
different
conclusion
than
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
i
think
that
is
within
the
purview
of
this
court's
past
decisions
which
have
said
over
and
over
again
that
in
confession
cases,
you
look
only
to
the
undisputed
evidence
of
record.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
agree
with
that
statement.
my
interpretation
of
that
statement
would
be
that
even
though
the
trial
judge
below
and
the
supreme
court
--
the
intermediate
state
supreme
court,
had
found
on
the
facts
that
they
examined
that
the
confession
was
voluntary.
this
court,
on
its
own
examination
of
the
facts,
can
come
to
the
opposite
conclusion
and
is
not
bound.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
oh,
certainly.
you
can
--
you
can
take
the
denial,
but
i
think,
going
to
even
more
specific
facts
of
haynes
against
washington,
which
i
don't
remember
in
great
detail.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
police
officer's
testimony
in
the
haynes
case
was
much
more
equivocal.
in
fact,
tended
to
support
the
petitioner's
position
that
he
had
been
promised
that
when
he
confessed
he
could
call
his
wife
and
see
the
lawyer
which
your
honor
felt
contributed
very
greatly
to
his
will
being
overborne
and
the
subsequent
making
of
his
statement.
whereas
here,
i
think,
and
this
is
i
think
one
of
the
distinguishing
factors
of
this
case
in
haynes
against
washington,
you
have
an
allegation
by
the
defendant
that
promises
were
made
and
a
you
have
a
specific
denial
by
the
officer
that
promises
were
made,
and
you
have
no
other
evidence
in
the
case
that
i
know
of
which
would
tend
to
throw
credibility
with
one
witness
or
another.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
if
this
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
the
reasonable
doubt
test
was
a
part
of
due
process
and,
therefore
binding
on
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
don't
think
it
is.
i
don't
know
of
any
opinion
of
this
court
which
has
said
that
voluntariness
must
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
i
don't
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
oh,
as
to
guilt,
surely.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes,
sir.
under
illinois
law,
the
question
of
the
credibility
of
a
confession
is
submitted
to
the
jury
along
with
all
the
other
evidence
and
the
jury
must
find
the
defendant
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
it's
raised
a
little
differently
in
illinois.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
no,
they
have
not.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes,
they
do.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
as
affecting
its
credibility,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
no.
no,
the
--
in
illinois,
the
legal
question
of
whether
or
not
a
confession
is
voluntary
and,
thus,
competent
evidence
is
only
for
the
trial
judge.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
once
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
right.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
and
in
order
to
give
it
--
if
they
believe
it
involuntary,
no
credit,
or
if
they
believe
it
to
be
voluntary,
credit.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
the
ultimate
burden
is
to
prove
the
defendant
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
don't
know
whether
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
don't
think
that
the
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
as
to
the
ultimate
question
of
guilt,
they
are,
but
i
don't
know
of
any
--
any
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
it
does
not
include,
in
my
view,
an
evidentiary
question.
that
is
to
say,
i
don't
think
the
state
is
required
to
prove
everything
about
a
particular
piece
of
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
because
this
is
something
that
the
jury
is
attaching
weight
to.
they
may
attach
more
or
less
weight
in
other
situations
outside
of
confessions.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
the
jury.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
only
in
the
sense
that
they
can
find
that,
because
it
was
coerced
or
because
promises
were
made,
it
is
not
entitled
to
credit
or
weigh
it
as
evidence.
they
don't
make
a
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
the
jury
does
not
reweigh
the
question
of
voluntariness.
the
jury
reweighs
--
the
jury
decides
only
the
question
of
credibility
but,
in
determining
that
question,
they
are
given
the
same
evidence
that
the
judge
heard
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
--
on
the
question
of
voluntariness.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that
--
no
charge
has
given
the
state
of
illinois
incorporating
the
term
“voluntariness.”
mr.
james
r.
thompson
in
effect
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes,
judge.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
the
evidence
would
only
go
to
the
jury
if
the
defendant
chose
to
continue
the
attack
on
the
confession
and
put
in
the
same
evidence
before
the
jury
that
he
put
in
before
the
judge.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
he
could
drop
the
matter
entirely
with
the
judge's
ruling
and
then
the
jury
would
hear
no
evidence
on
the
credibility
of
the
confession
simply
for
the
reason
that
the
defendant
was
no
longer
attacking
it.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
the
charge
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
the
charge
would
be
in
the
printed
or
the
original
typewritten
record
before
this
court.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes,
judge.
no
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
no
question
has
ever
been
raised
in
this
court
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
--
on
the
validity
of
the
charge.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
don't
think
any
burden
of
proof
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
--
was
stated
to
the
jury.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes.
and
they
are
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
i
can
answer
this
way,
your
honor.
i
have
never
seen
that
instruction
offered
and
i
have
never
seen
any
illinois
case
which
deals
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
judge
must
instruct
the
jury
in
terms
of
how
great
the
burden
of
proof
is.
it's
just
isn't
done.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
that
would
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
--
that's
never
been
requested
in
illinois.
illinois
defense
lawyers
have
never
asked
a
charge
which
instructed
the
jury
on
the
credibility
of
a
confession
in
terms
of
burden
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
even
the
--
even
the
paid
and
highly
competent
lawyers
haven't,
your
honor.
that's
just
simply
not
part
of
illinois
practice
at
all.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
it's
usually
read.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
it
might.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
as
substantive
evidence
of
guilt?
mr.
james
r.
thompson
as
substantive
evidence
of
guilt?
mr.
james
r.
thompson
it's
never
arisen
in
illinois
in
that
context.
it
has
arisen
in
the
context
of
a
motion
to
suppress
evidence
illegally
seized,
and
our
illinois
supreme
court
has
held
that
when
a
defendant
takes
the
stand
on
a
motion
to
suppress
evidence,
he
waives
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
only
for
the
purposes
of
the
motion,
so
that
if
he
does
not
testify
at
the
trial
and
does
not
waive
his
privilege
at
the
trial,
the
state
cannot
introduce
submissions
made
on
the
motion.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
correct,
unless
he
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
unless
he
takes
the
stand.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
right,
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
correct.
if
--
if
in
illinois,
a
defendant
does
not
testify
at
all
at
the
trial,
nothing
he
said
on
the
motion
to
suppress
evidence
can
be
used
against
him
as
an
admission
of
guilt.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
correct.
even
though
he
pursues
it,
if
he
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
--
does
not
testify,
it
could
not
be
used.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
no,
judge.
in
fact,
it
was
only
held
recently
in
connection
with
a
motion
to
suppress
evidence.
until
then,
we
had
wondered
whether
or
not
that
was
a
rule.
there
were
some
conflict
in
the
other
states,
but
i
assume
the
same
--
the
same
analogy
applies.
it's
dealing
with
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
whether
or
not
you
must
waive
that
in
order
to
pursue
another
constitutional
claim
of
due
process.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
the
illinois
rule
now
is
and
--
and
it
was
held
specifically
as
to
motions
to
suppress
evidence
illegally
seized,
that
if
the
defendant
takes
the
stand
on
the
motion
to
suppress
and
testifies,
he
waives
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
only
for
the
purposes
of
the
motion
and,
if
he
does
not
testify
at
the
trial,
his
evidence
given
at
the
motion
cannot
be
used
against
him
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
--
whether
as
admissions
or
anything
else.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes.
oh,
yes.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
surely.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
now,
the
second
distinguishing
factor,
i
think,
about
haynes
versus
washington
is
the
fact
that
in
the
opinion
this
court
specifically
said
that
there
really
was
no
need
for
the
police
to
pursue
the
questioned
interrogation
at
the
police
department
because
at
the
time
they
started
that
interrogation,
they
already
had
sufficient
evidence
to
bring
the
defendant
to
trial.
and
the
opinion
specifically
refers
to
an
oral
confession
made
shortly
after
the
arrest.
in
fact,
i
think
on
the
way
to
the
police
department,
which
was
not
attacked
in
the
court
below
and
was
not
attacked
in
this
court.
and,
therefore,
the
spano
concurring
opinions
and
crooker
and
cicenia
were
distinguished
on
the
grounds
that
here
was
not
a
situation
in
which
the
police
were
trying
to
clear
up
a
crime
or
question
a
suspect.
here,
the
police
were
merely
seeking
to
reinforce
already
competent
and
sufficient
evidence,
and
that
is
manifestly
not
true
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
at
the
time
diger
--
or
escobedo
was
arrested
the
second
time,
there
was
only
the
accusation
of
a
codefendant
which
had
come
some
--
an
hour
before
he
was
rearrested.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
the
codefendant
was
also
convicted
and
he
was
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
in
the
illinois
state
penitentiary
and
his
conviction
was
just
recently,
last
term,
reaffirmed
by
the
illinois
supreme
court.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
he
did
not
raise
the
question
that
was
raised
here.
so,
i
think
that,
unless
we
are
to
say
that,
in
all
coerced
confession
cases
where
no
counsel
is
present,
we
will
disbelieve
the
police
and
we
will
believe
the
petitioner,
we
cannot
find
a
comparable
situation
with
this
case,
with
haynes
versus
washington.
and,
haynes
versus
washington
would
not
control
the
disposition
in
this
case.
i
think
that
was
the
fundamental
error
made
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
in
its
first
opinion,
an
error
which
we
pointed
out
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
and
an
error
which
the
court
apparently
very
readily
saw
because
they
changed
their
minds
completely.
and
now
said,
in
agreement
with
the
state's
position
that
escobedo
said,
"aye",
and
montejano
said
“no”
and
that
there
was
a
conflict
in
evidence
and
therefore,
the
finding
of
the
trial
judge
that
the
confession
was
not
involuntary
had
to
be
upheld.
and
i
think
that
even
if
reasonable
doubt
was
the
standard
we
were
going
to
apply
to
these
cases,
if
you
have
a
case
where
one
person
says
one
thing
and
the
other
person
denies
it
and
that's
the
only
evidence,
then
the
burden
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
has
been
satisfied
because
that's
been
held
many
times
as
to
the
ultimate
issue
of
guilt
in
criminal
cases
where
you
have
one
identifying
witness,
for
example,
and
you
have
the
defendant's
denial.
that's
all
the
evidence
there
is.
many
courts
all
over
the
land
have
upheld
convictions
on
the
standard
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
on
that
ground.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
surely.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes,
sir,
and
he
has
to
believe
one
or
the
other
side,
and
when
he
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
as
i
--
judge,
as
i
read
the
earlier
cases
of
this
court
and
perhaps
i
interpret
them
wrongly,
but
where
the
court
has
said
on
earlier
occasions,
if
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
evidence
and
if
there
is
no
other
evidence
which
would
lead
us
to
favor
one
side
or
the
other,
but
simply
a
conflict,
this
court
cannot
find
opposite
to
what
the
state
supreme
court
found
or
the
trial
judge
found.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
suppose
the
situation
in
which
one
of
the
witnesses
who
conflicted
the
other,
was
substantially
impeached
by
other
evidence
or
the
circumstances
surrounding
his
denial,
though
apparently
a
flat
denial,
were
equivocal
such
as
the
denials
of
the
police
officers
in
haynes
versus
washington.
in
that
special
situation,
this
court
can
reexamine
as
it
said
in
haynes.
but
i
think
that's
a
different
kind
of
a
situation
that
the
court
is
faced
in
prior
opinions
where
they
had
simply
said,
“we
will
not
reexamine
conflicting
evidence.”
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
correct.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
let
me
say
this
to
your
honor.
i
agree
that
we
can't
settle
this
by
formula.
all
i
would
say
is
that,
in
this
case,
whatever
the
rule
is,
this
court
would
not
or
could
not
reasonably
find
that
the
confession
was
either
coerced
or
involuntary
or
was
of
promises
of
immunity.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes,
sir,
that's
right.
now,
there
are
several
things
said
in
the
argument
by
opposing
counsel
that
i
think
ought
to
be
clarified,
although
they're
perhaps
not
entirely
material.
the
first
is
that
this
was
not
a
case
of
arrest
with
warrant.
it
was
the
case
of
arrest
without
warrant
and
escobedo,
himself,
specifically
testified
that
at
record
17.
it
is
true
that
the
same
trial
judge
which
refused
to
suppress
escobedo's
confession,
suppressed
chan's
confession.
and
although
he
attempted
to
distinguish
the
two
cases,
i
would
not
for
one
moment,
suggest
to
your
honors
that
the
two
cases
can
be
distinguished
with
any
meaning.
and
all
i
can
say
to
your
honors
is
that,
in
suppressing
chan's
confession,
the
trial
judge
was
wrong
and
that
the
only
person
harmed
by
that
error
was
the
state
because
then
they
were
forced
to
nolle
the
case
against
chan
and
he
was
not
convicted.
it
does
not
follow,
however,
i
--
as
i
think
the
petitioner
seems
to
imply,
that
this
court
should
compound
the
error
by
also
suppressing
escobedo's
confession
because
as
we
all
know,
two
wrongs
do
not
make
a
right.
and
the
suppression
of
escobedo's
confession
in
this
case,
i
don't
think,
would
be
a
right
result,
so
that
we
are
not
governed
by
the
error
made
by
the
judge
as
to
codefendant,
chan.
and
it
is
not
true
that
escobedo
was
represented
by
the
public
defender.
escobedo
was
represented
by
private
counsel,
mr.
novak,
at
the
time
of
the
motion
to
suppress
because
the
public
defender
had
withdrawn
prior
to
the
decision
on
the
motion
to
suppress.
there
was
also
a
question
raised
about
the
participation
of
the
state's
attorney.
the
evidence
is
i
think
clear
that
the
particular
state's
attorney,
mr.
cooper,
who
took
the
confession
did
not
know
that
the
attorney
was
attempting
to
see
the
defendant
in
the
station.
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
when
we
get
to
the
second
issue,
i
don't
think
that
has
relevance
by
itself.
it
is
of
course,
offensive
to
us
as
lawyers
to
think
that
one
lawyer,
a
government
lawyer,
would
tell
another
lawyer
“go
get
a
writ”
or
use
some
other
expression.
i
don't
think
our
sensibilities
as
lawyers,
particularly
can
govern
this
case.
but
the
testimony
was
by
mr.
wolfson
that
a
police
officer
had
told
him
that
the
state's
attorney
had
said,
“go
get
a
writ.”
there
is
no
direct
evidence
that
the
state's
attorney
had
in
fact
said,
“go
get
a
writ”,
and
there
are
no
police
officer
testified
to
that.
now
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
think
ultimately
in
crooker,
the
state's
attorney
participated
and
i
think
the
same
was
true
of
cicenia.
let
me
move
to
that
point
now
about
whether
or
not
this
case
can
be
distinguished
from
cicenia.
i
don't
think
that
it
can
be.
certainly,
it
can't
be
on
the
facts.
now,
there
is
some
question
raised
that
cicenia
was
a
--
in
a
different
posture
before
this
court
for
the
constitutional
issue
reached
because
there
was
not
a
plea
of
not
guilty
in
that
case
with
a
contested
issue
on
the
confession
but,
rather,
what
new
jersey
call
a
plea
of
non
vult.
but
as
i
understand
the
majority
opinion
in
the
cicenia
case,
the
issue
before
the
court
on
the
validity
of
the
confession
because
of
the
absence
of
the
counsel
was
the
same
as
it
would
have
been
had
there
been
a
plea
of
not
guilty
and
had
the
issue
gone
to
trial
on
a
motion
to
suppress
because
there
was
reference
made
in
the
majority
opinion
in
cicenia
in
a
footnote
to
the
case
of
herman
against
claudy
which
seems
to
imply
that
where
there
is
a
coerced
or
incompetent
confession
which
precedes
a
plea
of
guilty,
then
the
court
may
still
reexamine
that.
in
fact
that
doctrine
is
involved
in
a
case
now
pending
before
this
court,
also
from
illinois,
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
plea
of
guilty
forecloses
an
independent
reexamination
of
constitutional
violations
that
may
have
preceded
the
plea.
and
we
took
the
position
in
illinois
in
that
case,
and
we
take
the
position
here
in
our
answer,
that
a
plea
of
guilty
will
not
always
foreclose
consideration
of
constitutional
violations.
and
as
i
understand
cicenia,
the
court
in
that
case
was
taking
the
same
position
that
the
plea
of
non
vult
did
not
foreclose
an
independent
examination
of
whether
or
not
that
confession,
i
suppose,
was
a
circumstance
that
prompted
the
plea
of
non
vult
if
it
was
in
fact,
incompetent
because
no
lawyer
was
present.
so,
if
the
legal
issues
are
the
same,
it's
clear
to
me
that
the
facts
of
this
case
cannot
be
distinguished
from
the
facts
of
cicenia.
the
ages
of
the
petitioner
are
substantially
similar.
he
consulted
with
an
attorney
before
he
went
to
the
police
station.
the
attorney
was
present
at
the
police
station.
he
asked
to
see
his
client.
the
client
asked
to
see
him.
admission
was
refused
and
the
confession
followed,
and
those
are
the
facts
here.
so,
i
think
that
if
this
court
is
to
decide
the
case
on
the
broader
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
question
is
incompetent
because
of
the
lack
of
counsel,
cicenia
must
be
overruled,
crooker
must
be
overruled
and
certainly,
the
cases
of
baker
and
groban,
the
language
in
the
majority
opinions
must
also
be
severely
limited.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
baker
and
groban,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes,
sir.
those
cases
refer
to
this
specific
situation
and
on
analogous
facts
held
that
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes,
sir.
groban
and
baker
would
have
to
be
overruled
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
--
in
my
opinion.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
in
re
groban.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
in
re
groban
was
the
state
fire
marshal
from
ohio.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
and
anonymous
against
baker
was
the
judicial
investigation
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
--
in
new
york
state.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
and
i
think,
certainly
the
language
in
the
majority
opinions
in
both
those
cases
would
have
to
be
overruled
if
petitioner
was
to
win
favor
here,
although,
of
course,
the
factual
situations
are
different.
now,
i
think
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes
sir.
i
think
you
could
overrule
groban
and
baker
were
that
situation
to
arise
in
any
case
and
at
the
same
time
affirm
this
case
on
the
broad
constitutional
issue
because
there
are
elements
of
distinction.
as
i
remember,
of
both
groban
and
baker,
and
certainly
groban,
there
was
the
element
of
compulsion
of
being
held
in
contempt
if
you
did
not
go
in
and
answer
questions
without
a
counsel
which,
of
course,
is
not
present
in
a
police
station.
be
that
as
it
may,
i
think
this
court,
on
examination
of
the
record
by
itself
will
conclude
as
did
the
illinois
supreme
court
the
second
time
around,
that
the
confessions
were
voluntary.
now,
i
turn
to
the
broader
issue
imposed
by
this
case.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
under
the
intervening
decisions
of
this
court,
since
crooker
and
cicenia
and
notably,
gideon
versus
wainwright,
that
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
danny
escobedo
had
a
constitutional
right
to
consult
with
his
counsel
at
the
police
station
upon
request,
then
that
constitutional
right
is
not
only
extended
to
escobedo
who
had
money
enough
to
retain
counsel
and
who
had
retained
counsel
banging
at
the
precinct
doors.
that
constitutional
right,
it
seems
to
me
cannot
help
but
to
be
extended
to
a
man
who
does
not
have
the
money
for
counsel.
this
court
said
in
gideon
that
all
persons,
at
least
in
felony
cases,
are
entitled
to
the
appointment
of
counsel.
this
court
said
in
the
carnley
versus
cochran
case
that
the
right
to
counsel
does
not
depend
on
a
request
for
counsel
and
that
a
man
who
walks
into
the
police
station
under
re
--
under
arrest
who
does
not
say,
“i
want
a
lawyer”
is
not
waiving
his
rights
to
a
lawyer.
and
let
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
two-fold.
first,
if
you
accept
the
proposition
that
a
man
under
arrest
in
questioning
in
a
police
station
before
charge
is
not
entitled
to
counsel
of
his
own,
then
i
see
no
impropriety
in
counsel
for
the
state
taking
part
in
the
investigation
or
interrogation.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
no.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
out.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
you'll
find
the
actual
practice,
most
states
vary
their
practice.
in
some
states,
the
state's
attorneys
never
take
part
in
interrogation.
even
illinois,
i
think
it
works
out
that
actually,
the
participation
in
the
interrogation
by
a
state's
attorney
is
unbalanced,
a
benefit
to
the
defendant
rather
than
if
only
police
interrogation
had
taken
place
because
a
state's
attorney
will
usually
see
to
it,
in
questioning
a
defendant,
for
example,
about
more
than
one
crime,
that
only
the
crime
with
which
they
are
going
to
try
the
man
is
put
into
that
particular
confession
so
that
he
would
not
be
prejudiced
at
a
later
trial
by
a
confession
making
reference
to
more
than
one
crime.
that
is
a
substantial
benefit
to
the
defendant.
it
also
breaks
the
ring
of
police,
the
contact
with
the
defendant.
he
sees
someone
other
than
somebody
from
the
police
department.
he
sees
somebody
from
what
we
might
call
the
outside
world.
now,
true
(inaudible)
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
no.
i
say
here,
this
is
a
benefit
to
the
defendant.
it's
not
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
--
something
that
should
be
extended
to
him.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
it's
a
practical
consequence.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
not
necessarily.
in
all
of
these
confession
cases,
there
enters
the
element
of
detention
by
the
police
only.
and
unless
we
are
to
say
there
are
to
be
no
confessions,
we
cannot
avoid
that
element.
all
i
say
is
that
when
the
state's
attorney
takes
part
in
the
interrogation,
there
flows
a
benefit
of
some
consequence
to
the
defendant
but
it
is
not
a
benefit
that
need
be
given
to
him.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
i
say,
one
of
the
reasons
is,
judge,
that
he
is
then
no
longer
in
strictly
police
custody.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
oh,
not
necessarily.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
illinois
--
at
least
under
the
illinois
practice,
when
state's
attorneys
participate
in
interrogations,
their
only
purpose
there
is
to
stand
there
and
record
whatever
the
defendant
wants
to
tell
them.
they
do
not
engage
in
extensive
cross-questioning
or
extensive
interrogation
as
a
police
officer
might.
their
function
is
very
much
different.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
oh,
i
don't
say
that
they'd
be
more
fair
than
the
policeman.
they'd
--
they'd
certainly
question
less
intensively
than
a
police
officer
would.
their
function
is
essentially
different.
the
function
of
the
police
is
to
investigate
crime
and
interrogate
with
the
view
to
getting
a
solution
to
crime.
the
function
of
the
state's
attorney
participating
in
the
interrogation,
at
least
as
far
as
the
illinois
practice
is
concerned,
is
when
a
defendant
has
confessed
simply
to
take
whatever
the
defendant
is
then
saying
and
put
it
down
in
proper
form.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
that's
right
because
police
aren't
--
aren't
at
all
trained
ordinarily
in
the
finer
points
of
taking
confessions.
they
have
their
own
methods
of
writing
out
statements
sometimes
that
are
sometimes
unsatisfactory.
they
might
question
the
defendant
about
more
than
one
crime
and
then,
at
the
trial,
you'd
face
the
problem
of
deleting
references
to
the
crime
and
making
the
confession
suspect
in
the
eyes
of
the
jury
and
the
function
as
to
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
oh,
absolutely.
that's
the
primary
purpose.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
not
if
you
take
the
view
that
the
adversary
system
does
not
begin
until
the
defendant
has
himself
the
right
to
a
lawyer.
and,
if
you
once
accept
the
view
that
he
has
not
the
right
to
a
lawyer
during
police
questioning
at
the
station
--
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes
sir.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
yes.
mr.
james
r.
thompson
well,
to
answer
that,
there's
no
doubt
that
this
court
has
the
power
to
hold
that,
as
a
part
of
fourteenth
amendment
due
process,
if
a
state's
lawyer
participates
in
the
investigation,
that
is
the
stage
at
which
counsel
must
be
given
to
the
defendant.
you
can
hold
that.
and
there
is,
as
you
say,
a
policy
argument
for
holding
that.
i
would
be
of
the
different
view.
i
would
take
the
position,
and
the
state
of
illinois
takes
the
position,
that
the
mere
interjection
of
a
state's
attorney
at
the
end
essentially
of
the
interrogation
process
to
take
the
final
confession
is
not
such
an
interjection
of
the
adversary
system
that
requires
the
appointment
of
counsel
for
the
other
side.
and
let
me
make
one
point
in
conclusion.
it
should
be
very
clear
that
we're
not
talking
merely
about
an
opportunity
to
consult
counsel.
now,
it's
true,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
that
i
ended
up
my
brief
by
saying
if
danny
escobedo
had
consulted
counsel,
he
would
not
have
confessed.
perhaps
that's
a
little
too
broad,
but
the
concurring
opinion
in
spano
and
the
new
york
decisions
make
very
clear
that
it
is
not
the
absence
of
consultation
with
counsel
that
is
important.
it
is
the
absence
of
counsel
that
is
important.
and
so,
i
take
it
that
if
mr.
justice
stewart's
concurring
opinion
were
the
majority
view,
if
the
question
arose
again,
that
a
man
under
indictment
who
clearly
has
the
right
to
counsel
who
was
questioned
at
all
by
the
police,
no
matter
how
many
times
he
had
consulted
with
counsel
since
his
indictment,
if
the
confession
came
in
the
absence
of
counsel,
and
those
were
the
words
used
in
that
concurring
opinion,
“the
absence
of
counsel”,
the
confession
would
be
incompetent.
so,
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
a
defendant
under
arrest
and
in
--
under
interrogation
in
a
police
department
has
the
right
to
counsel,
this
court
must
hold
the
confession
incompetent
in
the
absence
of
counsel
which
means,
essentially,
there
will
be
no
more
confessions.
thank
you.
