mr.
bernard
weisberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
speak
briefly
in
describing
our
position
in
this
case
and
then
touch
on
three
general
aspects
of
it.
our
position
is
that
the
constitutional
right
to
counsel
should
be
recognized
in
these
circumstances.
when
a
suspect
in
police
custody
makes
a
specific
request
for
an
opportunity
to
talk
to
a
lawyer,
when
he
asks
to
talk
to
retained
counsel
where
the
police
deny
the
request
and
proceed
to
interrogate
him,
as
they
did
here,
in
a
manner
which
was
clearly
seeking
a
confession,
where
the
interrogation
is
secret,
that
is,
no
one
is
present
who
is
either
neutral
or
loyal
to
the
interests
of
the
prisoner,
and
where
no
satisfactory
record
is
made
of
the
interrogation.
we
say
that
under
this
combination
of
circumstances,
all
of
which
were
found
in
this
record,
that
there
should
be
a
constitutionally
protected
right
to
counsel
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
yes.
i
would
--
mr.
bernard
weisberg
ultimately,
it
does.
i
would,
however,
again
--
mr.
bernard
weisberg
i
--
i
wish
to
be
frank,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bernard
weisberg
--
the
court
on
this
question
--
mr.
bernard
weisberg
i
appreciate
that.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
yes.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
i
--
i
wish
to
do
so.
i
would
not
stop
by
remarking
on
the
fact
that
the
question
of
what,
if
any,
waiver
rule
would
apply
in
these
cases
is
not
raised
in
this
case
because
here
we
have
a
specific
request
for
counsel.
i
will
go
beyond
saying
that
the
shaping
of
any
such
waiver
rule
is
for
future
cases
which
raise
that
issue.
i'm
not
prepared
to
delineate
all
of
the
contours
which
such
a
waiver
rule
may
take
if
and
when
it
is
developed
by
this
court.
i
would,
however,
add
a
few
observations.
first,
i
think
that
mr.
justice
douglas'
dissenting
opinion
in
ashdown
against
utah
was
clearly
correct
in
indicating
that
a
person
in
police
custody
should
always
have
the
right,
certainly,
to
waive
any
right
to
counsel
that
he
may
have
under
the
constitution
and
elect
to
talk
to
the
police.
it
certainly
seems
clear
to
me
that
there
would
always
be
some
waiver
rule
that
there
would
not
be
an
absolute
requirement
that
counsel
would
have
to
be
provided.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
i
--
i
don't
think
we
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
douglas,
because
i
think,
in
this
case
and
this
isn't
--
these
are
circumstances
of
course
not
peculiar
to
this
case.
we
have
not
only
the
arrest
of
the
suspect.
we
have
the
fact
that
the
suspect
is
obviously
in
jeopardy
because
when
the
police
arrested
him,
they
had
an
accusation
that
he
was
the
assassin.
we've
had
coupled
with
that
the
circumstances
that,
after
the
police
denied
his
specific
request
to
retain
counsel,
they
proceeded
to
interrogate
him
secretly
and
without
making
a
record
of
the
interrogation
proceeding.
now,
the
english
practice
to
which
your
honor
refers
has
recently
been
amended.
the
march
issue
of
the
criminal
law
review
contains
a
significantly
revised
statement
of
the
well-known
judges'
rules
on
interrogation.
it's
not
my
purpose
here
to
dwell
on
the
particular
changes
which
are
made
under
the
new
circular
of
the
home
secretary.
there
are
however,
significant
changes
and
i
think
the
court
will
be
interested
in
them.
to
return
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question,
which
i
have
not
completed
answering.
i
must
say
in
candor
that
i
do
not
find
the
prospect
you
described,
a
horrible
prospect.
it
seems
to
me
a
just
a
and
fair
rule
ultimately
to
say
that
the
constitutional
requirement
of
fairness
is
itself
a
requirement
that
an
ignorant
person
in
the
custody
of
the
police,
who
is
in
jeopardy
in
a
common
sense
meaning
of
that
term,
should
be
advised
of
his
rights
if
he
doesn't
know
them.
and
therefore,
i
--
i
agree
with
you,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that,
ultimately,
if
this
court
takes
the
first
step
down
this
road
of
developing
a
rule
of
constitutional
fairness
protecting
the
right
to
counsel
of
a
suspect
in
these
circumstances
there
are
certainly
further
steps
that
are
going
to
have
to
be
taken
someday.
there
may
also
be
turns
on
the
road
and
there
may
be
twists
back.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
i
--
mr.
bernard
weisberg
i
agree.
at
the
same
time,
if
i
may
be
permitted,
the
court
has
the
opportunity
to
develop
its
rules
one
step
at
a
time.
and
where
the
rule
is
as
potentially
important
as
this
one
is,
that
certainly,
seems
to
me,
wise
procedure,
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
suggest
here
that
the
rule
may
be
limited.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan
asked,
can
this
case
be
distinguished
from
cicenia
against
lagay?
i
agree
that,
factually,
it
cannot
be.
however,
i
believe
that,
in
terms
of
the
legal
arguments
and
the
issues
and
the
focus
presented
that
it
can
be
because
it
appears
from
the
reported
opinion
in
cicenia
that
the
case
was
argued
as
though
the
only
choice
were
between
an
absolute
right
to
counsel
on
request
of
a
suspect
in
police
custody
and
no
such
right
at
all.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
that's
right.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
that's
right.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
yes.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
i
agree
that
it
need
not
be
and
upon
recollection,
i
would
retreat
from
that
aspect
of
our
brief.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
i
said,
i
agree
that
it
need
not
be
if
the
rule
is
limited
as
i
have
suggested.
if
the
denial
of
the
specific
request
is
coupled
with
police
interrogation,
clearly
intended
to
seek
a
confession,
plus
secrecy,
plus
an
absence
of
a
satisfactory
record.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
--
mr.
bernard
weisberg
my
only
ability
to
distinguish
that
case
is
in
terms
of
the
manner
in
which
the
legal
issues
were
presented
to
the
court.
i
do
not
presume
to
distinguish
it
factually.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
i
think
what
we're
discussing
at
this
point
is
the
difference
between
overruling
cicenia
on
its
facts
and
holding
as
against
remarking
what
the
court
has
sometimes
observed
and
that
is
that
an
earlier
case
may
not
have
considered
the
issues
focused
in
the
same
manner
in
which
they're
focused
and
presented
in
a
subsequent
case.
at
that
--
mr.
bernard
weisberg
in
--
at
least
in
terms
of
the
legal
evaluation
of
the
position.
yes,
crooker,
of
course,
is
easier
to
distinguish
on
the
facts.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
that
would
be
with
respect
to
--
mr.
bernard
weisberg
that's
with
respect
to
a
holding
that
on
the
totality
of
circumstances
the
confession
was
obtained
by
constitutionally
impermissible
means.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
yes.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
i
would
like
to
return,
if
i
may,
and
proceed
to
develop
that
proposition
briefly
and
it
may
be
that
it
will
become
clear
in
the
course
of
that
discussion.
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
when
the
police
obtained
digerlando's
accusation
that
escobedo
was
the
assassin,
arrested
escobedo
and
confronted
him
with
the
accusation,
and
it's
worth
noting
here
that
on
this
record,
escobedo
testified
that
in
the
detective
car,
when
he
was
being
taken
into
the
police
station
on
the
night
of
the
30th,
he
was
told
two
things
one,
that
the
police
had
a
person
who
had
accused
him
of
being
the
assassin
and,
secondly,
“you
might
as
well
admit
the
crime.”
in
his
words,
“we
had
you
sowed
up
pretty
tight.”
the
first
aspect
of
that
statement
testified
to
by
escobedo
is
admitted
to
by
the
police
officer,
sullivan,
that
he
told
escobedo
in
the
car
in
the
way
in
that
the
police
had
someone
who
would
finger
him
as
the
assassin.
the
second
aspect
is
nowhere
contradicted
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
it's
an
undisputed
aspect
of
the
record.
this,
it
seems
to
me,
is
significant
because
of
the
fact
that
the
police,
not
only
confronted
him
with
the
accusation
but
made
it
clear
to
him
that
in
their
subsequent
interrogation
what
they
were
looking
for
was
a
confession.
it
seems
to
me,
there
could
be
no
reading
of
this
record
that
the
police
were
engaged
in
a
casual
or
a
neutral
inquiry
endeavoring
to
under
--
discover
the
circumstances
of
the
crime.
now,
it
may
be
asked,
well,
the
police
had
digerlando's
accusation,
wasn't
it
a
reasonable
thing
for
them
to
do
to
confront
escobedo
and
find
out
whether
he
admitted
it,
if
he
didn't,
who
was
telling
the
truth?
this,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
plausible
argument
but
it
rests
upon
a
fallacious
principle
and
that
is
the
police
should
be
the
triers
of
the
issue.
because
it
seems
to
me
that
if
that
is
accepted
a
proper
delimitation
of
proper
policed
work
in
these
circumstances
where
the
police
clearly
have
sufficient
evidence
to
arrest
and
charge
formally
with
the
crime.
that
then,
what
we
have
said
is
that
the
courts
are
unnecessary
in
a
very
meaningful
sense.
now,
when
escobedo
was
arrested
under
these
circumstances
by
the
police
he
was
in
every
sense
of
the
word
in
jeopardy.
he
needed
a
lawyer.
and
this
was
a
critical
stage
in
the
proceeding
which
culminated
in
his
conviction.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
the
police
testimony
was
that
they
had
an
oral
statement
obtained
earlier
on
the
evening
of
the
30th
from
digerlando
accusing
escobedo
of
having
been
the
assassin.
there's
no
suggestion
in
the
record.
i
don't
believe
that
that
statement
was
ever
reduced
to
writing.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
no,
no,
no.
no
formal
judicial
charge
of
any
sort.
escobedo
needed
a
lawyer
in
these
circumstances,
not
only
to
protect
him
against
abuses,
as
is
commonly
said,
not
only
to
tell
him
of
his
right
to
silence.
he
needed
a
lawyer
to
give
him
the
legal
advice,
without
which,
as
a
layman,
he
could
not
intelligently
evaluate
a
situation
or
decide
on
a
course
of
action.
there
is
this
to
be
said
for
the
fact
that
escobedo
made
a
specific
request
for
counsel.
it
showed
that
at
least
he
thought
he
needed
a
lawyer
and
it
probably
shows
that
he
thought
he
was
entitled
to
talk
to
a
lawyer
when
he
asked
to
do
so.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
between
--
i
--
i
--
mr.
bernard
weisberg
let
me
come
to
that
immediately.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
surely.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
that's
correct.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
that's
correct.
let
me
come
immediately
to
the
question
to
which
your
question
refers.
was
escobedo
prejudiced
by
the
denial
of
his
request
to
talk
to
his
lawyer
in
the
police
station
on
the
night
of
the
30th?
or,
putting
it
in
a
slightly
different
way,
did
he,
as
the
state
contends
here,
have
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel?
now,
the
state
bases
that
argument
upon
two
circumstances.
one,
the
one
to
which
your
honor
refers,
and
that
is
the
fact
that
admittedly
during
the
interval
between
his
first
arrest
on
the
20th
and
his
second
arrest
on
the
30th,
he
had
spoken
to
his
lawyer.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
the
content
of
that
consultation
except
for
escobedo's
statement
on
page
20
of
the
record.
that
a
few
days
before
he
was
arrested
the
second
time,
he
talked
to
his
lawyer
and
his
lawyer
told
him,
if
he
was
arrested
again,
not
to
answer
--
not
to
talk
to
the
police
without
first,
having
the
advice
of
his
lawyer.
the
second
fact
on
which
the
state
relies
in
arguing
that
escobedo
had
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
is
the
fact
that
when
escobedo
saw
his
lawyer
being
barred
through
the
open
doorway,
wolfson,
the
lawyer,
made
a
gesture
to
escobedo
which
escobedo
testified,
oddly
enough,
on
redirect
examination
by
his
own
counsel.
he
took
to
mean
he
should
not
talk
to
the
police.
those
are
the
two
facts
that
the
state
relies
on
to
argue
that
he
had
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
now,
as
to
the
first,
i
think
the
testimony
of
wolfson,
the
state
says
wolfson
talked
to
them
every
day,
i
think
i
will
not
take
the
time
to
read
the
testimony
but
i
think,
if
the
court
will
look
at
mr.
wolfson's
testimony,
and
i
believe
it
appears
on
page
10
of
the
record,
it's
in
the
hearing
on
the
motion
to
suppress,
it
will
be
apparent
that
when
wolfson
said
he
talked
to
his
clients
every
day
that
he
was
making
a
lawyer's
offhand
answer
to
a
question
which
by
implication
raised
perhaps
a
question
about
whether
he
discharged
his
responsibilities.
escobedo's
testimony
on
page
20
is
much
more
specific,
that
they
talked
a
few
days
before
and
wolfson
told
him
not
talk
without
a
lawyer's
advice.
that
only
puts
that
into
perspective.
i
think
the
daily
consultation
theme
in
the
state's
brief
has
to
be
cut
down
to
size.
but
coming
to
the
more
important
second
point,
when
wolfson
made
a
sign
or
shook
his
head
to
escobedo
through
the
open
doorway
which
escobedo
took
to
mean
“don't
talk,
don't
say
anything
to
the
police.”
was
that
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel?
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
a
joke
to
say
that
that
is
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
because
if
that
is,
then
the
constitutional
principle
and
the
constitutional
right
can
be
satisfied
by
a
gesture,
by
a
shake
of
the
head
or
by
a
finger
to
the
lips,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
sixth
and
the
fourteenth
amendments
mean
more
than
that
in
these
circumstances.
we
suggest
that
this
was
a
critical
stage
for
escobedo's
proceeding
in
every
sense
of
the
word.
that
within
the
logic
of
this
court's
decisions
in
hamilton
against
alabama
and
white
against
maryland,
he
was
entitled
to
a
constitutional
right
to
counsel.
the
state
suggests
that
for
purposes
of
the
powell
against
alabama
--
mr.
bernard
weisberg
quite
so.
i
say,
only
with
--
mr.
bernard
weisberg
i
say,
only
within
the
logic
of
those
cases.
i
make
no
claim
that,
factually
they
go
that
far.
i
say
that
the
principle
of
those
cases
should
extend
to
a
case
such
as
this
where
the
police
interrogation
under
all
of
the
circumstances
is
clearly
in
a
common
sense
meaning
of
the
term
“a
critical
stage”
in
the
proceeding
against
the
prospective
defendant.
now,
as
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
escobedo
was
prejudiced,
i've
spoken
of
the
one
aspect
of
that
and
that
is
whether
or
not
he
had,
as
the
state
claims,
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
there's
one
aspect
--
one
other
aspect
which
should
be
referred
to.
he
was
of
course,
perhaps
prejudiced
because
he
confessed
and
maybe
he
wouldn't
if
he
talked
to
his
lawyer
first.
he
was
prejudiced,
i
think,
in
a
more
meaningful
way
because
of
the
fact
that
the
secrecy
and
the
absence
of
a
record.
and
these
seemed
to
be
the
most
remarkably
unfair
things
about
this
entire
type
of
proceeding.
the
secrecy
and
the
absence
of
the
record
are
conditions
created
by
the
affirmative
act
of
the
state
which
is
an
entire
control
of
this
proceeding
and
they
have
the
effect
of
depriving
him
of
a
fair
trial
on
the
question
of
the
admissibility
of
his
confession
because
it
means
that
the
only
witnesses
are
the
defendant
and
the
police.
the
state
knows
that
there
are
going
to
be
disputes
about
the
conduct
of
such
an
interrogation
and
yet,
it
sets
the
stage
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
objective
evidence
of
what
actually
happened
unavailable.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
type
of
unfairness
rises
to
a
constitutional
level
of
unfairness.
and
that's
why
i
stress,
as
one
of
the
circumstances
under
which
the
constitutional
right
should
be
recognized,
the
conducting
of
a
secret
and
unrecorded
interrogation
by
the
police
after
it
is
apparent
that
they
are
looking
for
a
confession
and
that
they
have
sufficient
evidence
to
justify
an
arrest
and
a
charge.
now,
the
state
says
that
a
critical
stage,
within
the
logic,
not
the
factual
holding
on
the
facts
of
hamilton
and
white,
that
a
critical
stage
in
a
criminal
proceeding
can
come
only
after
the
judicial
process
has
been
invoked,
that
is
after
there
is
some
kind
of
formal
charge,
if
only,
by
the
police.
we
say
this
is
altogether
unrealistic
because
of
the
fact
--
if
only
because
of
the
fact
that
the
timing
of
such
action
is
entirely
under
the
control
of
the
police
and
the
prosecutor.
and
under
those
circumstances
it
seems
to
me
that
whether
we
have
an
indictment
as
in
spano
should
not
make
a
critical
difference.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
way
to
evaluate
the
--
that
the
critical
dividing
line
is
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
in
jeopardy
in
a
practical
and
common
sense
way
and
here
it
appears
that
he
was
once
the
police
arrested
him
and
undertook
the
investigation.
i
would
like
to
stress
that
there
are
a
number
of
ways
in
which
this
case
does
not
necessarily
raise
the
broad
issues
to
which
mr.
justice
harlan's
first
question
referred
and
which
the
state's
brief
stresses.
we
have
here
a
specific
request
for
retaining
counsel.
we
have
the
conduct
of
a
secret
and
unrecorded
interrogation.
it
is
not
necessary
therefore
in
this
case
to
explore
the
ultimate
reaches
of
what
constitutional
rule
of
waiver
may
ultimately
be
developed
for
cases
in
which
there
is
either
no
request
for
counsel
or
in
which
the
defendant
is
indigent.
i
would
like
to
speak
very
briefly
of
the
matter
of
the
practical
consequences
for
law
enforcement
to
with
which
the
state's
brief
stresses.
the
state
says
that
a
ruling
here
that
escobedo
had
a
constitutional
right
to
talk
to
his
lawyer
would
mean
an
end
to
police
questioning,
an
end
to
confessions,
and
would
cripple
law
enforcement.
these
arguments
of
course
are
traditional.
one
recent
example
is
referred
to
in
the
court's
opinion
in
mapp
against
ohio.
another
example,
of
course,
is
some
of
the
reaction
to
the
court's
decision
in
mallory
against
the
united
states.
in
1957,
assistant
attorney
general
olney
told
the
committee
of
the
house
that
“the
police
could
not
observe
mallory
or
else
they
would
have
to
close
up
shop.”
those
were
his
words.
the
local
united
states
attorney,
mr.
gash,
told
the
same
committee
in
1957
that
the
mallory
decision
created
an
emergency
situation
which
required
immediate
lesi
--
legislative
correction.
but
in
1960,
mr.
gash,
in
a
speech
referred
to
in
the
article
of
professor
comisar,
cited
in
our
brief,
took
the
position
that
mallory
had
actually
contributed
to
an
improvement
in
law
enforcement
work
in
the
district
of
columbia.
that
because
they
had
been
trained
to
observe
the
mallory
rule,
the
district
of
columbia
were
laying
more
emphasis
on
pre-arrest
investigation
where
interrogation
is
not
subject
to
any
serious
question
of
principle
and
were
making
better
cases
and
relying
less
on
confessions.
now,
it
is
also
significant,
i
think,
that
the
justice
department
apparently
takes
the
view
that
affording
the
opportunity
to
talk
--
call
a
lawyer
and
talk
to
him
before
you're
interrogated
would
not
cripple
law
enforcement
because
this
is
the
position
reflected
in
certain
amendments
proposed
by
the
justice
department
to
house
bill
7565
or
is
it
7525,
now
in
the
senate
committee
on
the
district
of
columbia.
that
bill
has
not
yet
been
reported
out
but
indications
are
and
advised
that
the
senate
will
incorporate
the
amendments
proposed
by
the
justice
department.
in
conclusion,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
predictions
of
a
breakdown
in
law
enforcement
should
be
taken
with
a
grain
of
salt,
to
put
it
mildly
by
the
court.
these
are
extravagant
predictions.
i
do
not
candidly
suggest
that
it
is
possible
on
the
facts
available
to
us
now
to
say
that
these
predictions
are
correct
or
that
the
opposite
predictions
are
correct,
that
a
more
restrictive
rule
would
contribute
to
more
efficient
police
work.
i
do
say
that
the
suggestion
in
the
state's
brief
that
we
would
have
a
breakdown
in
law
enforcement
is
an
assumption
which
is
not
based
on
facts
and
that
there
is
no
sufficient
showing
to
justify
the
kind
of
unfairness
--
mr.
bernard
weisberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
i
don't
undertake
to
generalize
about
the
practical
effects
on
law
enforcement
throughout
the
country.
i
undertake
to
generalize
only
about
what
i
believe
the
constitutional
requirement
of
fairness
indicates.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
new
york.
new
york,
people
against
donovan
referred
to
at
length
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
no
--
mr.
bernard
weisberg
donovan
now
holds
that
even
before
a
formal
charge.
i'm
cutting
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bernard
weisberg
i
should
say
candidly
that
the
case,
of
course,
did
not
necessarily
raise
the
second
question
because
here
--
mr.
bernard
weisberg
i
think
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
only
question
that's
raised
is
the
denial
of
any
opportunity
to
talk.
i
believe,
ultimately,
that
if
lawyers
were
permitted
to
be
present
at
police
interrogations,
we
might
find
that
they
--
there
wouldn't
be
these
predictions
that
they
would
always
say,
“don't
talk.”
but
if
the
lawyer
was
there
to
see
and
hear
the
questions
asked
and
the
counsel
answered
particular
questions
that
we
might
have
a
good
deal
more
of
the
even
active
cooperation
with
the
police
on
the
part
of
people
who
were
implicated.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
presence
of
the
lawyer
at
the
interrogation
provides
more
constructive
possibilities
than
dangers
to
law
enforcement.
mr.
bernard
weisberg
is
that
at
least
--
mr.
bernard
weisberg
i
can
only
propose
in
this
case
a
holding
that
there
must
be
a
constitutional
right
to
consult
prior
to
any
police
interrogation
because
the
case
does
not
raise
the
broader
question
of
whether
the
lawyer
is
constitutionally
entitled
to
be
present
in
the
interrogation.
