justice
john
m.
harlan
this
is
before
indictment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
for
--
for
a
charge
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
you
distinguish
this
case
in
cicenia
against
lagay?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
--
are
you
arguing
that,
in
a
state
case,
there
is
an
absolute
federal
right
to
counsel
before
there
can
be
any
police
interrogation
once
a
man
is
under
suspicion?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
think
that's
cicenia,
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
cicenia.
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
both
came
down
the
same
day.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
know
the
so-called
massachusetts
rule
up
there,
do
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
police
interrogation
was
in
question-and-answer
form?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
those
were
the
statements
you
were
talking
about
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
is
that
--
is
that
printed
in
this
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
where
is
the
full
statement?
is
that
in
our
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
typewritten
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that's
here
in
the
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
now,
just
a
minute.
if
you
take
that
position
limiting
it
to
the
facts
of
this
case
that
you're
arguing,
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
your
constitutional
proposition,
why
wasn't
it
found
that,
in
the
case
of
an
ignorant
defendant,
it's
the
duty
of
the
police
to
advise
him
before
interrogating
or
investigating
at
all
--
i
mean,
confronting
him
at
all,
to
advise
him
that
he
should
have
a
counsel
before
he
says
anything
to
them?
justice
john
m.
harlan
doesn't
your
position
go
that
far?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
think
you
ought
to
be
--
embrace
the
full
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
standing
of
your
our
position
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
because
that
was
the
thing
that
the
court
expressed,
concerned
about
in
a
state
case
in
cicenia.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
if
you
recall
cicenia,
the
majority
opinion
recognized
that
in
a
federal
case,
what
happened
there,
the
court
would
not
tolerate
that
kind
of
conduct
but
in
a
state
case,
it
raised
questions
as
to
the
extent
and
reach
of
any
such
rule
as
you're
now
announcing.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
you
ought
to
address
yourself
frankly
to
that
proposition.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
when
you
make
constitutional
doctrine,
you
try
to
look
a
little
--
ahead
a
little
bit
and
see
where
you're
going.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and,
therefore,
i
think
that
you
must
face
up
to
that
and
recognize
that
that's
the
core
of
a
very
difficult
problem.
these
cases
are
easy
to
decide
if
you
just
decide
them
as
a
case
and
don't
care
where
you're
going,
where
you're
looking
at,
what
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
consequences
are.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that
was
the
issue
that
was
presented.
that's
the
reason
we
didn't
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
have
to
deal
with
anything
else.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
that
was
cicenia.
you
have
to
--
you
have
--
that
was
in
fact
cicenia.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
but
the
holding
in
cicenia
was
that
there
was
no
absolute
right
to
counsel
at
a
pre-arraignment
stage.
and
as
i
understand
your
argument
that
you
first
embarked
in
even
limiting
it
as
you
suggested,
you
would
let
him,
would
require
a
ruling
of
cicenia.
i'm
not
saying
that
that
isn't
a
perfectly
permissible
argument,
but
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
that
may
well
be,
may
well
be.
but
that
was
not
the
proposition
to
which
you
started
to
address
yourself.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
(inaudible)
had
they
took
before
the
second
interrogation,
he
had
a
lawyer.
justice
john
m.
harlan
between
the
two
interrogations.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
let
me
finish
my
question
on
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong,
and
that
in
the
interval
and
before
his
lawyer
tried
to
see
him
at
the
jail
and
the
second
occasion,
he
had
been
told
by
his
lawyer
not
to
say
anything
to
the
police.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
correct?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
even
in
those
cases,
we
have
to
draw
on
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
says
that,
you're
entitled
to
counsel
automatically
in
case
of
an
arraignment
or
preliminary
proceeding,
depending
upon
whether
the
character
of
that
arraignment,
the
proceeding
as
such,
that
it
affects
your
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
different
states
might
have
different
points
of
view
on
this
problem.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
character
with
whether
it's
an
agricultural
community
where
i
suppose,
gangsters
(inaudible)
in
other
states
where
they
have
large
cities,
the
crime
is
probably
different.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
pretty
hard
to
generalize
though.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
the
constitution
is
--
the
constitutional
requirement
as
to
a
judge
turns
the
fact
that
we
have
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
a
little
confused
but
i
--
because
this
seems
to
me
quite
opposite
to
what
your
opponents
held.
let
me
put
this
case
to
you.
the
judge
holds
--
defense
counsel
gets
up
and
moves
to
suppress
the
confession.
the
judge
says,
“alright,
i'll
hear
evidence
on
it.”
at
the
end
of
the
hearing,
he
rules
that
confession
is
voluntary.
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
the
jury
--
can
the
jury
then
decide
that
the
confession
is
not
voluntary?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i
understood
your
opponent
to
say.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
you
do
not
have
the
massachusetts
rules
so
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
correct.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
a
defendant
would
not
be
entitled
to
a
charge
to
the
jury
saying
that
despite
the
fact
that
the
court
has
ruled
this
confession
as
voluntary,
it's
within
the
jury's
province
to
decide
that
it
was
involuntary
and
if
involuntary,
it
shouldn't
be
considered
at
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
john
m.
harlan
