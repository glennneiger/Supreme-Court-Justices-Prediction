mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arose
out
of
the
federal
power
commission's
summary
rejections
of
applications
for
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity,
applications,
which
had
been
submitted
by
producers
from
natural
gas
for
authority
to
sell
gas
to
interstate
pipelines.
the
rejections
were
in
accordance
with
general
regulations
because
the
contracts
under
which
the
sales
were
proposed
to
be
made
contained
indefinite
pricing
clauses,
that
is
clauses
in
addition
to
the
normal
type
which
were
not
prohibited
by
the
regulations
such
as
a
provision
that
gas
should
be
paid
for
at
so
many
cents
per
thousand
cubic
feet
and
provisions
for
fixed
escalations
in
such
prices.
that
is
that
the
price
should
go
up
every
year
or
two
or
five
years
by
half
a
cent
or
a
cent,
something
like
that.
nor
other
provisions
for
the
reimbursement
to
the
seller
of
any
increases
he
might
incur
in
taxes,
production
taxes,
severance
taxes,
gathering
taxes.
all
of
those
clauses
were
allowed.
but
the
indefinite
pricing
clauses
which
were
the
object
of
the
regulation
are
further
provisions
designed
to
increase
the
prices
fixed
under
the
clauses
to
which
i've
already
referred,
increased
to
move
them
up,
keep
them
up
to
the
highest
prevailing
level,
there
are
variety
of
such
clauses,
the
second
party
favored
nation
clause,
which
says
that
if
the
buyer
pipeline
pays
anybody
else
a
higher
price,
this
price
will
have
to
rise
equally.
the
third
party
favored
nation
clause,
if
anybody
else
in
the
same
area
or
field
pays
a
higher
price,
this
price
will
rise
accordingly.
spiral
escalation
clauses
which
provide
that
if
the
buyers
own
prices
go
up,
he
must
pay
his
producer
a
higher
price,
the
kind
of
provision
that
was
incidentally
involved
in
the
--
the
wisconsin
case,
wisconsin
against
the
federal
power
commission,
the
second
phillips
case
that
was
here
few
years
ago.
redetermination
clauses,
which
provide
that
at
specified
times,
the
price
shall
be
recomputed
upon
the
basis
of
the
highest
prevailing
prices
two
or
three
in
average
or
something
of
that
kind
and
renegotiation
clauses.
the
commission
also
rejected
at
the
same
time
the
contracts
under
which
the
sales
were
proposed
to
be
made,
which
were
filed
as
rate
schedules
or
submitted
for
filing
as
rate
schedules
governing
the
sales
if
they
should
be
certificated.
now,
there
was
no
question
and
there
is
no
question
here
that
the
regulations
applied
to
the
proposed
--
the
--
the
applications
which
were
filed.
the
contracts
had
been
executed
after
the
regulations
became
effective.
the
clauses
fell
within
the
proscribed
class
and
there
had
been
no
request
for
waiver.
this
becomes
important
later.
the
regulations
of
the
commission
explicitly
provide
for
filing
applications
for
waiver
or
amendment,
or
repeal
of
rules.
and
this
--
this
provision
for
waiver
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
these
rejections
and
throughout
the
30-day
period
within
which
these
parties
had
--
which
they
had
in
which
to
file
their
applications
for
rehearing,
which
are
prerequisite
to
going
to
the
court.
the
court
below
set
aside
the
commission's
rejections
on
the
ground
that
the
regulations
were
invalid,
not
because
they
were
unreasonable,
the
court
didn't
reach
that
question,
but
because
the
commission
had
no
power
to
issue
such
regulations
it
said.
it
held
that
the
power
commission
cannot
deny
certificate
applications
without
the
hearing
provided
in
the
certificate
sections
of
the
act,
section
7.
and
that
the
commission
cannot
refuse
to
allow
rates
without
the
hearing
provided
in
sections
4
and
5,
the
rate
sections
of
the
act.
while
our
petition
for
certiorari
was
pending
in
this
court,
the
ninth
circuit
in
a
--
exactly
--
in
an
exactly
parallel
case,
the
superior
oil
company
case
reached
the
opposite
result,
upheld
a
commission
rejection
under
corresponding
situation.
and
superior's
petition
for
certiorari
is
--
and
our
acquiescences
are
pending
before
this
court
because
of
the
square
inter
circuit
conflict
on
the
question,
"can
the
federal
power
commission
by
a
general
regulation
refuse
to
consider
certificate
applications
and
rate
filings
where
the
governing
contracts
contained
pricing
clauses,
the
commission
has
determined
are
incompatible
with
the
public
interest.
these
regulations
were
developed
in
a
series
of
cautious
steps
over
a
period
of
some
eight
years.
the
first
step
was
taken
in
may
of
1954
shortly
before
the
phillips
decision
holding
producer
rates
and
sales
subject
to
the
commission's
jurisdiction.
the
rule-making
proceeding
was
initiated
in
accordance
with
the
--
the
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
for
a
rule
with
respect
to
the
clauses
of
this
kind
and
its
chief
importance
now
is
in
the
early
recognition
or
the
recognition
at
least
at
that
time
of
the
existence
of
the
problem.
two
years
later,
the
commission
initiated
a
second
rule-making
proceeding.
in
the
light
of
the
experience,
it
had
by
that
time
had
with
producer
rate
filings.
and
in
the
light
of
that
experience,
it
appeared
that
if
indefinite
pricing
clauses
could
be
proper
--
properly
and
appropriately,
outlawed
by
a
general
regulation
large
numbers
of
questionable
increased
rates
could
not
be
filed
under
the
mobile
rule
require
--
prohibiting
filing
of
rate
increases
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
contracts.
but
action
was
delayed
in
this
rule-making
proceeding
until
a
decision
was
forced
on
the
commission
by
the
pure
oil
case.
pure
oil,
a
producer,
filed
for
increases
under
its
favored
nation
clauses.
the
purchaser,
el
paso,
objected,
said
that
the
favored
nation
clause
had
not
been
activated,
had
not
been
triggered
by
the
transaction
that
it
was
relied
upon,
and
therefore,
under
mobile,
the
filing
could
not
be
made.
the
public
utilities
commission
and
the
people
of
california
intervened
in
that
proceeding
before
the
commission
contending
that
these
favored
nation
clauses
were
as
it
contended
all
favored
nation
clauses
were
unlawful
and
void
the
same
contention
that
was
made
in
the
wisconsin
case
before
this
court.
the
commission
ruled
that
they
were
not
void
under
existing
laws
and
regulations
as
this
court
ruled
in
the
--
in
the
wisconsin
case,
but
that
they
should
be
outlawed
in
future
contracts
and
issued
its
regulation
232
which
contains
much
of
the
substance
of
the
regulation
now
in
effect.
the
pure
oil
opinion
is
important
here
for
what
it
reveals
about
the
indefinite
pricing
clause
problem.
and
i
referred
to
it
not
to
argue
the
reasonableness
of
the
regulation
because
that
question
was
not
passed
on
by
the
court
below
and
we
have
not
attempted
to
argue
it
in
our
briefs
here
but
to
show
something
of
the
nature
of
the
problem
with
which
these
regulations
attempted
to
deal.
the
first
element
that
the
commission's
opinion
in
the
pure
oil
case
discloses
is
that
so
long
as
such
clauses
are
allowed,
there
need
be
no
economic
or
other
substantial
justification
for
the
increased
rate,
it
can
be
filed
any
way.
and
as
long
as
it
can
be,
the
experience
has
shown
that
most
in
--
almost
every
case,
in
most
cases,
the
increase
is
filed.
the
mere
fact
that
a
higher
price
is
paid
to
some
other
producer
would
be
sufficient
to
activate
the
--
the
clause.
the
opinion
refers
to
the
lack
of
any
substantial
relationship
to
the
factors,
which
bear
on
the
value
of
the
gas
or
on
a
determination
of
a
reasonable
level
of
rate
for
that
sale.
a
second
factor
discussed
in
the
opinion
is
the
interacting
and
cumulative
effect
of
these
clauses
in
numerous
contracts
in
the
same
area,
one
acting
upon
the
other,
triggering
the
others
and
this
in
turn
triggering
more
until
a
chain
reaction
is
produced.
it
was
estimated
by
el
paso
in
that
case
--
in
the
pure
oil
case
that
if
that
chain
reaction
which
had
occurred
there
stood,
el
paso's
costs
of
purchased
gas
each
year
would
increase
from
35
or
up
to
possibly
$51
million,
the
increase
of
$35
million
to
$51
million
a
year.
a
third
element
referred
to
in
the
pure
oil
opinion
was
that
the
pos
--
that
the
possibility
of
such
increases
under
indefinite
pricing
clauses
makes
it
impossible
when
an
application
for
a
certificate
is
before
the
commission
for
the
commission
to
judge
what
the
pipelines
cost
of
gas
is
going
to
be
if
the
initial
price
is
subject
to
be
increased
and
the
event
anybody
else
increases
his
price,
the
commission
cannot
determine
whether
the
pipeline
addition
or
the
new
pipeline
should
be
--
will
be
economically
feasible.
and
the
fourth
element
that
the
commission
mentioned
is
that
these
favored
--
these
indefinite
pricing
clauses
have
given
rise
to
difficult
problems
of
interpretation.
under
the
mobile
decision,
the
court
--
the
commission
must
determine
whether
an
increase
filed
under
one
of
these
clauses
maybe
accepted
whether
it
is
or
it's
not
in
accordance
with
the
contract.
and
if
it
is
not,
it
must
reject
it.
and
this
has
raised
exceedingly
difficult
and
complex
questions.
one
of
those
questions
took
seven
years
to
decide.
it
was
in
the
court's
four
years
came
to
this
court
on
the
merits
once
and
the
second
time
this
court
--
or
after
the
court
below
had
affirmed
the
commission's
interpretation
of
the
clause,
this
court
denied
certiorari.
another
one
where
both
factual
and
legal
questions
were
involved
took
--
has
already
taken
over
four
years
and
it's
now
pending
in
the
third
circuit
on
a
record
that
was
made
before
the
commission
of
more
than
7000
pages.
and
while
this
preliminary
threshold
jurisdictional
question
is
being
considered
and
awaits
decision
by
the
commission
and
by
the
courts,
the
commission
is
prevented
from
reaching
the
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
rate
which
is
proposed.
and
that
question,
the
statute
says
is
one
that
the
commission
must
give
preference
to
over
all
other
questions
pending
before
it
and
decide
as
speedily
as
possible.
now,
this
indicates
the
kind
of
problems
that
were
sought
to
be
dealt
with
by
order
232.
and
in
contract
executed
thereafter,
that
order
provided,
that
indefinite
pricing
clauses
should
be
inoperative
and
of
no
legal
effect.
but
the
commission
invited
further
comments
and
in
effect,
it
enunciated
a
further
rule-making
proceeding
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
by
inviting
further
comments
and
publishing
that
request
in
the
federal
register
and
serving
it
on
natural
gas
companies.
and
as
a
result
of
the
comments
which
were
received,
some
30
comments
being
received,
the
commission's
substantially
modified
or
ameliorated
232
to
permit
some
indefinite
pricing
clauses.
if
they
were
not
operative
more
than
once
in
any
five-year
period,
during
which
no
fixed
escalations
occurred
and
if
the
prices
which
were
used
as
a
point
of
reference
for
the
increase
where
prices
which
were
themselves
subject
to
the
commission's
jurisdiction
and
the
commission
had
not
questioned
those
prices.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
they
participated
in
every
one
of
these
rule-making
proceedings
i
have
spoken
out
by
submitting
comments
and
data
and
argument
.and
those
comments
and
data,
we
have
large
copies
of
them
with
the
court
so
that
the
court
can
look
at
them
if
it
wants
to.
these
are,
we
believe,
legislative
history
materials.
they
are
part
of
the
proceedings
back
of
the
rule-making
proceeding
and
maybe
judicially
noticed
their
part
of
the
official
files
of
the
commission.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
pipeline
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
producers.
the
producers
--
yes.
that
is
the
question
i
come
to
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
in
the
court
very
shortly.
thank
you.
now,
i
do
want
to
just
first
speak
of
the
inadequacies
which
remained
and
led
to
the
further
--
the
final
form
of
this
present
regulation.
by
outlawing
these
provisions
saying
they
should
be
inoperative
and
of
no
effect
certain
inadequacies
were
still
failure
to
deal
with
the
problems,
still
remain.
the
certificate
applications
and
rates
which
contained
such
clauses
could
still
be
filed
with
the
commission
and
if
they
were
filed,
even
though
there
was
no
economic
justification
or
it
appeared
to
be
none
for
them,
the
commission
would
have
to
conduct
a
proceeding
on
each
one
and
they
would
still
produce
these
chain
reactions
of
which
i
have
spoken.
so
in
october
of
1961,
the
commission
issued
its
third
rule-making
proceeding
and
the
effect
of
that
was
to
provide
for
the
rejections.
that
brings
us
then
to
the
question
of
whether
rejections
under
such
a
regulation
are
valid,
whether
the
commission
has
power.
and
we
submit
that
the
federal
power
commission's
choice
to
proceed
by
regulation
rather
than
as
the
court
below
indicated
it
should
by
a
trial
like
hearing
in
every
case
was
basically
simply
an
attempt
to
deal
with
a
general
problem
in
a
general
way.
the
two-frequent
failure
of
regulatory
agencies
to
do
more
of
this
kind
of
thing
was
strongly
criticized
by
mr.
james
m.
landis
and
his
report
to
president
elected
kennedy
in
1960.
his
report
emphasized
that
agency
should
devote
more
attention
to
the
formulation
of
policy
and
to
the
embodiment
of
policy
in
general
rules
and
regulations.
instead
of
getting
submerged
in
the
ad
hoc
adjudication
of
individual
cases
and
it
is
interesting
that
so
modest
and
attempt
to
do
what
mr.
landis
urged
that
a
regulation
so
cautiously
developed
as
this
by
successive
commissioners
in
office
over
a
span
of
eight
years
and
a
regulation
aimed
at
the
problem
singled
out
by
mr.
landis
as
exhibit
a
in
his
museum
of
administrative
horrors
should,
in
the
succeeding
three
years
have
drawn
us
into
court,
into
courts
of
appeals
in
7
--
in
17
cases
and
ultimately
here
today.
perhaps
the
broadest
ground
on
which
the
tenth
circuit
ruled
that
the
commission
lack
of
power
here
was
that
proceeding
by
general
rule
instead
of
ad
hoc
adjudication
violates
the
mobile
principle,
which
mr.
justice
brennan
in
the
sunray
mid-continent
case
characterized
as
recognition
of
the
integrity
of
private
contracts.
but
the
tenth
circuit
never
faces
up
to
the
obvious
question
why
does
a
general
regulation
violate
that
principle
anymore
than
case-by-case
elimination
of
indefinite
pricing
clauses.
suppose
the
commission
were
to
depend
on
the
case-by-case
approach,
and
i
think
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
i
answer
your
question
now.
if
in
that
case,
if
it
were
to
proceed
case-by-case,
the
commission
would
have
to
accept
each
producer's
certificate
application
although
it
was
based
on
a
clause
or
contract
that
contained
such
a
clause
as
this.
it
would
have
to
hold
a
hearing
in
all
of
the
usual
--
on
all
of
the
usual
questions
of
issues
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
such
as
the
level
of
the
initial
price.
and
in
addition,
it
would
have
to
hold
the
question
on
whether
this
indefinite
pricing
clause
was
compatible
with
the
public
convenience
and
necessity.
now,
probably
there
would
be
interventions
on
questions
of
this
kind.
the
commissions
in
the
states
of
california
and
wisconsin,
the
public
service
commission
of
new
york
had
been
intervening.
we
have
their
interventions
probably.
there
would
be
an
examiner's
decision
after
the
hearing
and
exceptions
to
it
and
breathing
an
oral
argument
before
the
commission
and
the
commission
decision.
now,
assume
that
the
commission
should
decide
in
such
a
case
that
the
indefinite
pricing
clause
is
incompatible
with
the
public
convenience
and
necessity.
under
the
teaching
of
catco,
it
can
do
one
of
two
things.
it
can
deny
the
certificate
or
it
can
condition
the
certificate
presumably
upon
the
elimination
of
the
indefinite
pricing
clause,
and
the
producer
can
take
it
or
leave
it.
each
such
producer
in
such
a
proceeding,
case-by-case
proceeding,
would
be
in
the
same
position.
it
is
in
under
this
general
regulation
if
it
applies
for
a
reg
--
for
a
waiver.
it
has
the
same
burden
of
proof.
it
has
the
same
risk
of
drainage
if
there's
a
risk
of
drainage
pending
the
decision.
it
has
the
same
possibility
of
meeting
that
by
emergency
steps.
the
only
difference
is
that
the
commission
must
repeat
the
same
kind
of
proceeding
every
time
a
producer
brings
it
in,
scores
maybe
hundreds
of
time
and
decide
again
the
same
question,
the
question
which
so
far
as
anything
that
has
yet
been
developed
shows
there
is
no
substantial
difference
between
cases
on
and
decide
that
time
and
again
every
time
a
producer
comes
in
and
brings
it
before
us.
because
unless
there
is
a
rule
such
as
we
have
here,
the
commission
cannot
refuse
to
consider
the
question.
it
must
under
the
statute
hold
a
hearing.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
the
reason
we
have
statute
law
which
lays
down
regulations
in
advance.
that's
the
reason
we
have
a
--
a
power
in
an
administrative
agency
to
act
by
general
rule,
to
eliminate
that
necessity
for
dissipating
the
commission's
time
and
energy
on
questions
would
have
--
that
it
has
in
substance
resolved.
as
this
court
has
made
clear
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
we
do
not
have
figures
on
how
many
of
the
producer's
certificate
applications
contain
these
indefinite
pricing
clauses.
that
has
bothered
me
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
get
that.
there
are
about
1400
of
producer
regulations
a
year
to
be
considered
of
which
there
--
there's
an
unknown
number
that
contain
these
clauses.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
well,
the
commission
has
referred
to
it
in
the
pure
oil
opinion
and
subsequently
as
floods
of
these
filings.
as
this
court
as
made
clear,
the
choice
between
the
ad
hoc
adjudicatory
process
and
the
general
rule-making
process
is
one
for
the
administrative
agency.
in
the
chenery
case
the
court
said,
this
is
the
second
chenery
case,
the
function
of
filling
in
the
interstices
of
the
act
should
be
performed
as
much
as
possible
through
this
quasi-legislative
promulgation
of
rules
to
be
applied
in
the
future.
the
choice
made
between
proceeding
by
general
rule
or
by
individual
ad
hoc
litigation
is
one
that
lies
primarily
in
the
informed
discretion
of
the
administrative
agency.
now,
a
closely
related
ground
that
seems
to
be
interwoven
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
for
the
decision
it
reached,
it
seems
to
be
that
because
the
statutory
restriction
of
sales
of
gas
to
those
sales
that
are
required
by
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
is
coupled
in
the
statute
with
provisions
to
accomplish
that
objective
by
certificates
issued
in
accordance
with
the
proscribed
hearing
and
other
procedural
requirements.
the
commission
is
barred
from
using
its
general
rule-making
power
to
aid
in
accomplishing
the
same
objective.
and
similarly
that
because
the
statutory
requirement
that
contracts
relating
to
rates
shall
be
just
and
reasonable,
it
is
coupled
with
provisions
to
accomplish
that
objective
through
hearings
to
fix
just
and
reasonable
rates
and
contracts.
the
commission
is
barred
from
using
its
general
rule-making
powers
to
aid
in
accomplishing
that
objective.
but
we
think
that
the
definitive
answer
to
the
court
below
is
that
this
court
has
already
passed
on
this
question
in
the
storer
case,
united
states
against
storer,
in
351
u.s.,
page
192,
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
reed.
and
while
there
were
dissents,
there
was
no
dissent
on
this
point,
no
expressed
dissent
on
this
point.
in
that
case,
the
federal
communications
rule-making
power
under
which
it
had
acted
is
certainly
no
broader
than
that
of
the
federal
power
commission
under
which
the
power
commission
acted
here.
the
rule,
which
was
promulgated
by
the
federal
communications
commission,
was
promulgated
under
the
same
administrative
procedure
act
provisions
under
which
the
power
commission
acted.
it
invited
comments.
it
did
not
hold
a
trial
like
hearing,
the
same
as
true
with
the
power
commission.
that
rule
of
the
federal
--
of
the
federal
communications
commission
barred
the
issuance
of
station
licenses
to
any
person
already
interested
in
more
than
a
specified
number
of
stations.
and
the
communications
act,
like
the
gas
act,
the
communications
act
in
the
section
309
provides
for
the
issuance
of
licenses
after
a
hearing
requires
that
a
hearing
be
held
before
an
application
can
be
denied.
it
was
contended
in
that
case
that
the
rule
of
the
federal
communications
commission
was
invalid
because
it
constituted
a
denial
of
a
license
application
without
a
hearing,
the
same
ground
on
which
the
court
below
relied.
and
this
court
upheld
the
communications
commission's
rule
in
these
--
these
terms.
at
least
i
might
mention
these
two
sentences.
we
agree
with
the
contention
of
the
commission
that
a
full
hearing
such
as
this
required
by
section
309
would
not
be
necessary
on
all
such
applications.
as
the
commission
has
promulgated
its
rules
after
extensive
administrative
hearings,
it
is
necessary
for
the
accompanying
papers
to
set
forth
reasons,
sufficient
if
true
to
justify
a
change
or
waiver
of
the
rules.
we
do
not
think
that
congress
intended
the
commission
to
waste
time
on
applications
that
do
not
state
a
valid
basis
for
a
hearing.
now,
that
decision
of
this
court
was
argued
extensively
in
--
in
our
briefs
and
in
oral
argument
to
the
commission
below,
extensively
by
us
and
to
a
certain
extent,
by
our
opponents.
and
though
it
was
so
argued,
it
is
not
even
mentioned
in
the
court's
opinion
except
on
another
point
with
relation
to
jurisdiction,
which
was
also
an
issue
in
the
storer
case.
the
court
--
the
tenth
circuit
did,
however
say,
argue
seems
to
have
been
very
much
impressed
with
the
consideration
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
effective
judicial
review
in
the
absence
of
a
trial-like
hearing.
but
as
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
superior
case
pointed
out,
this
would
require
that
all
general
rule-making
by
administrative
agencies
be
based
on
a
trial-like
hearing.
other
courts
have
found
no
difficulty
in
passing
on
the
reasonableness
of
agency
rules
adopted
by
the
same
procedure.
that
was
true
in
the
storer
case.
it
was
true
by
the
ninth
circuit's
superior
case.
the
ninth
circuit
did
pass
on
the
reasonableness
of
this
very
regulation.
it
was
true
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
the
recent
public
service
commission
of
the
new
york
against
the
federal
power
commission
where
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
had
under
consideration
the
validity
of
the
power
commission's
regulation
governing
the
issuance
of
temporary
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
so
tenth
circuit
goes
on
to
say
that
there
was
no
finding
by
the
commission
in
haec
verba
that
these
provisions
of
the
contracts
are
not
just
and
reasonable,
the
finding
that
is
specified
in
the
rate
sections
of
the
act
and
no
explicit
finding
in
haec
verba
that
the
clauses
are
incompatible
with
the
public
convenience
and
necessity.
but
here
again,
we
should
point
out
that
the
commission
was
acting
under
section
16,
its
power
to
enact
general
rules
and
regulations
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
the
act.
it
was
not
acting
under
the
specific
rate
and
certificate
sections
which
require
hearings
or
require
findings.
section
16
requires
no
finding.
it
only
specifies
that
the
rule
be
one
which
is
necessary
or
appropriate
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
the
act.
the
procedures
for
accomplishing
that
kind
of
rule-making
have
been
prescribed
in
the
administrative
procedure
act,
section
4
(b)
of
that
act,
provides
for
participation
by
the
submission
of
comments,
data,
and
argument.
but
expressly
--
expressly
says
that
this
may
or
may
not
be
in
the
discussion
of
the
agency
include
oral
presentation
of
any
kind.
in
section
4
(b)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
does
not
require
any
findings.
it
only
specifies
that
after
consideration
of
all
relevant
matter
presented,
the
agency
shall
incorporate
in
any
rules
adopted
a
concise,
general
statement
of
their
basis
and
purpose.
there
is
no
contention
that
the
power
commission
has
failed
to
comply
with
that
requirement.
and
even
if
we
go
on
to
argue
in
our
brief,
even
if
the
hearing
requirements
of
sections
4
and
5
and
7
were
applicable
and
did
have
to
be
made,
the
commission's
statements
made
in
issuing
order
232.
and
in
--
by
reference
in
its
opinion
in
the
pure
oil
case,
we
show
under
repeated
decisions
are
sufficient
to
meet
the
substance
of
the
findings
requirements
of
those
sections.
now,
insofar
as
the
tenth
circuit
rested
on
the
ground
that
the
commission
lacks
power
to
regulate
contracts
under
the
principle
of
the
mobile
case,
we
submit
that
it
is
clearly
wrong.
because
there
was
no
question
before
this
court
in
the
mobile
case
of
the
commission's
power
to
regulate
contracts
and
no
decision
reached
on
that
question.
the
question
there
was
of
the
company's
power
to
file
rate
increases
with
the
commission
in
violation
of
its
contracts,
not
of
the
commission's
power
to
regulate
contracts.
and
though
there
was
no
question
of
the
commission's
power
to
regulate
contracts,
this
court
was
careful
in
the
opinion
written
for
the
court
by
mr.
justice
harlan
to
make
it
plain
that
it
had
not
passed
on
that
question
and
that
there
should
be
no
implication
of
that
kind
drawn
from
the
decision.
because
it
is
stated
in
that
opinion
at
page
344
and
i
quote
a
part
of
the
language,
"denying
to
natural
gas
companies
the
power
unilaterally
to
change
their
contracts
in
no
way
impairs
the
regulatory
powers
of
the
commission
for
the
contracts
remained
fully
subject
to
the
paramount
power
of
the
commission,
to
modify
them
when
necessary
in
the
public
interest."
this
reading
was
confirmed
in
the
subsequent
opinion
of
this
court
in
the
sunray
mid-continent
oil
company
case
where
mr.
justice
brennan
wrote
the
opinion
for
the
court
and
he
said
this,
"the
short
of
the
matter
is
that
mobile
recognized
that
there
were
two
sources
of
price
and
supply
stability
inherent
in
the
regulatory
system
established
by
the
natural
gas
act,
the
provisions
of
private
contracts
and
the
public
regulatory
power."
now
in
our
brief,
we
review
the
explicit
language
of
sections
4
and
5,
and
the
numerous
cases
which
have
uniformly
upheld
commission
orders
requiring
modifications
of
contract,
uniformly
upheld
commission
orders
requiring
modifications
of
contracts,
done
so
both
in
cases
on
the
regulation
of
rates
and
service
and
in
cases
involving
the
issuance
of
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
now,
i
believe
that
it
is
unnecessary
at
this
time
to
shake
more
time
here
on
that
question.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
sir,
and
--
and
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
we
have
some
very
good
examples
because
since
the
tenth
circuit
has
held
the
regulation
invalid,
we've
had
the
problem
of
what
to
do
in
the
mean
time
and
we
have
had
many
producers
--
certificate
applications
submitted
including
--
when
i
say
many
--
i
know
off
something
in
the
neighborhood
30
of
them.
and
in
recent
--
since
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit,
we've
been
doing
this.
the
application
is
received
with
these
indefinite
pricing
clauses
in
it
that
the
regulation
proscribes
if
the
regulation
is
valid.
i'm
not
sure
what
the
immediate
procedure
is
but
probably
there
is
a
rejection
of
them
in
accordance
with
the
regulation.
this
has
always
been
true.
following
that
rejection
in
order
to
go
to
court,
the
company
must
apply
for
a
rehearing
and
has
30
days
within
which
to
apply
for
a
rehearing.
at
that
time,
it
may
apply
for
a
waiver
and
we
have
recently
been
granting
these
waivers
conditioned
on
the
outcome
of
this
litigation.
if
the
commission's
regulation
is
ultimately
sustained,
then
those
parties
are
required
to
eliminate
those
clauses
upon
their
contracts.
if
the
regulation
is
not
sustained,
then
this
waiver
waives
the
rule
as
to
them
and
allows
those
indefinite
pricing
clauses
to
remain
in
their
contracts.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
--
that's
right.
that's
right.
the
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
pro
--
provision
of
the
commission's
rules
allows
any
party
to
file
a
petition
to
seek
a
waiver
of
the
commission's
rules
or
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
the
waiver
is
terminated.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
pardon.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
believe
it
is
so.
i
--
i've
made
this
unnecessarily
confusing.
i'm
using
a
recent
example
but
the
example
was
not
a
good
one.
if
a
company
comes
in
and
says,
"we've
got
special
economic
circumstances.
the
regulation
would
--
however
good
it
maybe
as
to
others,
should
not
be
applied
to
us,
then
the
commission
may
waive
the
rule
as
to
it
or
the
company
can
come
in
and
ask
for
a
repeal
of
the
rule
or
on
modification
of
the
rule,
"
that
this
section
of
the
commission's
regulations
permits
that
to
be
done.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
sir.
in
connection
with
the
certificate
proceeding.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
sir.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
sir.
yes
sir.
there
had
been
two
such
applications
for
a
waiver
granted
by
the
commission.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
whole
purpose
of
the
waiver
is
to
accord
them
on
hearing.
this
is
the
same
kind
of
thing
that
was
involved
in
the
storer
case
where
mr.
justice
reed's
opinion
relies
on
the
fact
of
the
right
to
a
waiver.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
i
was
going
to
draw
that
qualification.
again,
the
--
if
--
if
there's
no
factual
question
raised
on
which
a
hearing
would
be
necessary
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
waiver
would
have
to
show
grounds
for
--
for
exception
from
the
general
rule,
from
the
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
they
are
--
thus
far
--
well
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
no
request
for
waiver
so
we
don't
reach
that
question.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
precisely.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
as
this
court
said
in
the
--
in
the
storer
case,
there's
no
need
for
a
hearing
where
no
grounds
have
been
presented
for
the
departure
from
the
general
rule.
now,
i
would
like
to
take
time
now
to
turn
unless
there
are
other
questions
on
this
to
the
venue
question
which
we
saved
in
our
petition
for
certiorari.
texaco,
one
of
the
two
respondents
here,
after
having
taken
several
previous
cases
for
involving
federal
power
commission
orders
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
and
then
having
taken
one
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
under
the
principal
place
of
business
clause
of
section
19
(b)
of
the
gas
act.
in
this
case,
went
to
the
tenth
circuit
under
a
claim
that
it,
texaco,
is
located
in
the
tenth
circuit
within
the
meaning
of
section
19
(b),
although
under
the
normal
meaning
of
the
word
"located"
as
the
legal
residence
which
in
the
case
of
a
corporation
is
the
state
in
which
it
is
incorporated,
texaco
should
have
gone
to
the
third
circuit,
it
being
incorporated
in
delaware.
but
the
tenth
circuit
held
that
it
had
venue
this
--
of
this
case
and
there
are,
in
its
opinion,
at
least
three
discernible
grounds
for
that
decision.
the
first
is,
its
statement
in
its
opinion
that
texaco
and
i
quote,
"conducts
extensive
operations
in
that
circuit
referring
to
the
tenth
circuit."
but
if
"located"
is
the
equivalent
of
the
place
where
extensive
business
is
done,
congress
would
not
have
needed
to
have
added
in
section
19
(b)
a
provision
for
venue
upon
the
basis
of
the
principal
place
of
business.
if
doing
some
business,
if
doing
extensive
business
is
enough,
congress
wouldn't
have
had,
then
go
on
and
add
a
principal
place
of
business.
in
fact,
the
tenth
circuit's
opinion
deprives
the
language
of
principal
place
of
business
as
any
meaning
or
purpose
in
section
19
(b).
it
makes
it
a
pure
redundancy
in
violation
of
the
--
the
usual
important
and
helpful
rules
of
statutory
interpretation
that
meaning
shall
be
given
to
all
provisions
of
the
statute
if
that's
reasonably
possible.
the
tenth
circuit
admitted
in
its
opinion,
admitted
as
much,
when
it
said
that
there
was
overlapped
in
the
provisions
and
it
has
--
it
had
construed
them.
but
it
said
that
the
overlap
was
for
the
purpose
of
clarity.
well,
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
need
for
clarity
if
the
clauses
are
properly
interpreted
and
probably,
this
kind
of
an
explanation
could
be
made
in
--
against
every
case
in
which
courts
attempt
to
give
meaning
to
all
provisions
of
a
statute.
and
it's
not
necessary
here
because
if
lo
--
located
is
construed
in
its
normal
meaning
of
legal
residence
and
principal
place
of
business
is
given
its
normal
meaning,
both
are
given
meaning,
both
are
consistent.
the
second
ground
on
which
the
tenth
circuit
seems
to
have
denied
venue
--
or
upheld
venue
is
this
and
i
quote
its
language."
more
importantly,
the
gas
is
produced
in
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
performance
of
the
contract
occurs
in
the
tenth
circuit."
now,
that
maybe
a
good
conflict
of
laws'
rule
for
determining
the
state
whose
laws
shall
govern
the
contract
but
there
is
no
authority
that
we
know
of
in
statute
or
in
case
law
or
anywhere
for
the
proposition
that
texaco's
performance
of
its
contract
in
the
tenth
circuit
shows
that
texaco
is
located,
the
company
is
located
there.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it
was
saved,
if
your
honor
please.
it
was
not
the
basis
for
seeking
certiorari
but
it
would
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
it
was
specified
as
a
question
that
was
reserved
to
be
argued.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
thank
you.
on
page
2
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
in
footnote
number
1,
"if
certiorari
is
granted,
commission
reserves
the
right
to
argue."
court
below
erred
in
not
dismissing
the
petition
for
lack
of
vain.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
that's
right,
but
this
has
become
even
more
important
than
it
was
at
the
time
the
petition
was
filed.
because
within
the
last
few
days
as
we
have
shown
by
supplemental
letter
to
the
court,
the
precise
venue
question
on
these
precise
arguments
that
i'm
advancing
now
made
by
us
in
a
motion
to
dismiss
a
similar
case
in
the
fifth
circuit,
has
resulted
in
the
fifth
circuit
dismissing
a
petition
for
one
of
proper
venue.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
if
you
sustain
us
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
oh,
my
associate,
of
course,
reminds
of
what
i
should
have
thought
up
sooner.
this
question
is
present
only
in
the
texaco
case.
the
other,
the
substantive
question
is
still
present
as
--
with
respect
to
pan
american,
the
other
respondent
which
was
a
separate
case
before
the
tenth
circuit.
and
as
the
pan
american,
the
question
must
be
decided.
the
venue
question
if
we
are
sustained
will
eliminate
only
the
texaco
case.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
get
your
question.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
we
would
--
we
do
need
to
get
this
settled,
there
have
been
--
there
have
been
many
of
them
and
it
is
important
then
--
it's
now,
we're
glad
we
have
a
conflict
because
we
hoped
the
court
will
decide
the
venue
of
question
as
well.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it's
my
understanding
of
the
practice
of
the
court
that
where
it
grants
certiorari
to
review
a
question
such
as
the
substance
that
we
have
here
and
that
the
petition
reserves
the
right
to
--
intention
to
argue
a
second
question
that
this
court
will
consider
and
that
that
is
open
to
consideration
by
the
court,
and
we
may
--
we
may
argue
it
at
any
rate.
and
now
that
we
may
argue
it,
and
now
that
there
is
a
conflict,
we
hoped
that
the
court
will
pass
on
it.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
no,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
on
the
venue
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
on
the
merits,
we
have
a
conflict
between
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit.
that's
--
that's
on
this
question
of
the
validity
of
the
regulation.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
up
until
i've
got
to
venue.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
now
on
--
there
is
the
conflict
of
the
tenth
circuit
with
the
--
with
the
ninth
circuit
on
--
on
the
merits,
on
the
validity
of
the
regulation.
there
is
also
--
has
developed
since
this
petition
was
filed,
a
conflict
between
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuit
on
this
venue
of
question,
the
venue
of
question
being
raised
only
with
respect
to
the
respondent,
texaco,
here.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
when
we
--
when
we
petition
for
review
of
the
tenth
circuit's
decisions
in
two
cases.
one
involving
texaco
and
one
involving
pan
american.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
we
raised,
so
far
--
we
pointed
out
the
existence
of
this
question
with
respect
to
venue
and
reserved
the
right
to
argue
that
question
with
respect
to
venue
in
the
case
when
--
which
texaco
was
the
petitioner
in
the
tenth
circuit.
now,
we
are
arguing
the
venue
of
question
with
respect
to
the
texaco
case
in
the
tenth
circuit.
this
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
you
do
not
reach
within
the
texaco
case.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
you
do
reach
it
in
this
case,
but
so
far
as
it
relates
to
the
respondent
pan
american.
the
third
ground
on
which
the
tenth
circuit
seems
to
have
faced
its
ruling
on
venue
is
one
that
sounds
better
at
first
than
it
appears
on
examination.
"congress,"
the
court
said,
"substituted
the
word
"located"
in
section
19
(b)
for
an
earlier
use
of
the
word
"resides"
in
an
earlier
draft."
therefore,
having
substituted
"located"
for
"resides,"
and
the
court
said,
"congress
must
have
intended
to
use
"located"
in
a
different
meaning
from
that
of
the
word
"resides."
but
a
comparison
of
that
original
draft
and
the
late
--
and
the
present
form
of
the
statute
shows
that
the
change
from
"resides"
to
"located"
was
incident
to
a
more
important
change
and
is
"located"
very
plainly
appears
to
have
been
used
as
the
synonym
for
"resides."
the
more
significant
change
that
was
made
was
at
incident
was
--
was
that
in
fixing
the
circuits
in
which
review
might
be
sought
of
federal
power
commission
orders.
the
original
draft
had
provided
that
the
circuit
should
be
determined
by
reference
to
the
petitioner.
the
party
agreed,
circuit
related
to
him.
in
the
revised
draft
that
which
became
the
law,
the
circuit
is
determined
by
reference
to
the
company
to
which
the
order
relates.
that
seems
to
have
been
the
important
change
that
was
made
and
the
change
in
the
use
of
the
word
"located"
for
the
word
"resides"
seems
very
clearly
to
have
been
that
in
--
that
the
draftsman
intended
to
avoid
saying,
the
circuit
wherein
the
public
utility
resides.
if
it
had
used
the
word
"resides,"
it
would
in
this
new
language
have
had
--
did
he
say
the
public
utility
resides
and
it
was
to
avoid
the
awkwardness
of
that
phrase,
we
submit
that
the
court
changed
--
that
the
draftsman
changed
the
language.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
point
is
that
the
original
language
said,
"the
circuit
wherein
the
--
in
such
a
person
resides,
meaning
the
agreed
person.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
if
it
had
just
substituted
that
the
circuit
wherein
the
licensee
or
public
utility
that
was
the
language
of
the
power
act
resides,
it
would
have
been
an
--
an
awkward
phrase
to
speak
of
a
public
utility
as
residing
in
a
circuit,
and
the
draftsman,
we
submit
has
sought
to
avoid
that
awkwardness
by
saying,
"wherein
the
public
utility
is
located."
but
we
believe
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
using
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
yes.
i'd
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
believe
i
have
two
minutes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
well,
in
those
two
minutes,
i
think
that
it
is
an
opportunity
after
having
had
a
few
moments
to
let
the
thoughts
spill
on
over
us
as
they
have
been
coming
at
us
for
two
hours.
to
recollect
that
the
key
issue
in
this
case
is
the
power
of
an
agency
directed
by
a
statute
not
to
promulgate
any
rules
going
to
either
rights
or
contracts
which
will
be
effective
in
the
future
without
holding
a
hearing
and
developing
an
evidentiary
record.
the
issue
then
is
the
power
of
that
agency
despite
that
statute
to
hold
such
a
hearing
that
does
not
provide
for
a
record
or
the
development
of
those
facts.
this
was
an
issue
that
has
come
up
once
before.
it
did
not
get
as
far
as
this
court
but
it
was
actively
litigated
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
before
1960,
the
federal
power
commission
issued
its
general
policy
statement
in
which
it
promulgated
prices
for
some
23
areas
in
the
country.
and
in
that
general
policy
statement,
it
provided
for
specific
prices.
and
the
consumers
of
natural
gas
felt
that
they
did
not
like
those
prices
and
they
challenged
the
issuance
of
that
policy
statement
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
there
the
court
said,
“but
this
is
only
a
matter
of
policy.
there
has
been
no
hearing.
the
commission
cannot
promulgate
prices
without
a
hearing.
the
avenues
of
recourse
and
the
development
of
facts
must
be
kept
open
as
they
are
here
under
this
policy
statement.”
“but
the
statement,
“said
the
court,
“may
stand.”
so,
these
rules
may
stand
as
policy
only.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
lower
court
in
wisconsin
held
exactly
this
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
this
court
merely
affirmed
what
the
lower
court
had
said
your
honor
that
the
policy
statement
prices
were
no
more
than
guidelines
just
as
the
tenth
circuit
below
here
has
permitted
these
prices
that
i
held
up
earlier
to
be
statements
of
the
commission's
policy
to
let
the
industry
know
generally
how
the
commission
feels
about
these
clauses.
but
obviously
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
excuse
me
your
honor?
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
prices?
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
no,
your
honor,
they
are
not.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
oh,
they
will
--
they
will
permit
a
filing
and
they
will
permit
hearings
as
to
why
you
should
have
a
right.
and
this
is
the
only
reason
that
the
court
--
the
district
of
columbia
court,
where
the
policy
statement
was
specifically
challenged
permitted
the
policy
statement
to
stand.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
it
was
also
where
the
consumers
really
got
concerned
about
it
was,
that
--
that
it
appeared,
put
on
both
a
ceiling
and
a
floor.
and
they
were
concerned
that
if
--
if
a
price
filed
below
the
ceiling
were
submitted
to
the
commission,
the
commission
would
automatically
stamp
it
and
approve
it
and
the
commission
has
not
allowed
that.
a
challenge
can
be
put
in
even
for
prices
below
the
policy
statement
and
a
hearing
held.
but
as
you
say
mr.
justice
white,
if
it's
over,
you're
certainly
going
to
get
that
hearing.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
no,
your
honor,
yes
and
no.
number
one,
the
--
the
policy
statement
did
promulgate
prices
for
certain
producing
areas
rather
than
specific
fields
as
they
are
designated
in
the
industry.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that
within
an
area
such
as
a
certain
large
number
of
counties
and
railroad
in
texas.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
if
you
file
for
a
price
that
exceeds
the
policy
statement,
make
a
certificate
application,
the
commission
consolidates
a
great
number
of
these
applications
and
has
the
statutory
hearing
to
determine
the
public
convenience
and
necessity.
and
it
may
condition
the
certificates
if
it
--
on
the
basis
of
that
record,
finds
that
they
do
not
need
the
test
of
the
public
convenience
and
necessity.
they
do
not
reject
your
application
in
that
instance.
the
policy
level
is
just
that.
it
is
a
policy.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
excuse
me
your
honor?
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
but
only
when
there
is
a
record
which
will
support
it
in
a
court
of
review
which
you
have
a
right
to,
under
section
19
(b)
of
the
natural
gas
act,
permits
you
to
bring
that
record
before
a
competent
court
of
review
to
see
whether
there
are
findings
which
support
the
commission
in
its
cut.
and
there
must
be
findings
of
record
and
there
must
be
facts
of
record
to
support
the
finding
that
a
condition
should
issue.
and
they
have
not
just
cut
them
to
the
policy
level,
your
honor.
in
some
cases,
the
commission
had
stated
that
the
facts
of
record
require
even
a
further
reduction
in
the
policy.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
absolutely.
and
that
hearing
has
been
permitted
in
those
cases
but
it
has
been
permitted
in
the
cases
of
these
contract
clauses.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
well,
the
--
the
certificate
proceeding?
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
well,
first
of
all,
these
clauses
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
these
clauses
go
obviously
directly
to
the
price
that
you
will
be
able
to
file
for.
and
secondly,
the
authority
of
the
commission
over
a
contract
and
price
is
spelled
out
in
the
same
sections
of
the
act.
they
have
no
greater
authority
over
price
than
they
have
over
contract,
exactly
the
same
statutory
limit
is
placed
on
them.
price
and
contract
appear
in
the
same
section
of
the
natural
gas
act
in
the
same
sentence.
there
can
be
no
greater
authority
over
one
than
the
other.
no
--
no
permission
to
do
something
without
findings
as
to
one
but
the
necessity
for
findings
as
to
the
other.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
correct
but
you
have
the
opportunity
to
put
on
the
evidence,
your
honor.
the
hearing
is
held
and
the
evidence
is
taken.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
and
in
the
absence
of
the
compelling
evidence,
you
--
you
can't
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
very
barrier
is
the
fact
that
this
rule
and
regulation
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
precludes
us
from
having
contracts
that
will
permit
us
to
come
before
the
commission.
this
is
our
essential
complaint
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
but
--
well,
the
rate
is
the
product
of
the
contract
terms
that
we
have,
your
honor.
and
as
mr.
justice
white
asked
this
morning
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
well,
that
it
--
i
don't
see
how
the
commission
can
--
can
ever
protect
the
consumers
if
it
is
permitted.
if
any
agency
is
permitted
to
promulgate
prices,
contracts
or
anything
else
without
evidence,
without
a
hearing
in
which
the
consumer
can
appear
to
state
what
he
thinks
the
price
ought
to
be.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
your
honor
there
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
no,
not
at
all.
they
had
in
our
contract
--
oh,
we
had
in
contract
also,
your
honor,
the
result
at
the
end
of
--
of
10
years
and
15
years
to
negotiate
--
renegotiate
the
contract
price
on
the
basis
of
quality,
quantity
and
all
the
other
pertinent
provisions
as
to
delivery
conditions
in
the
10
and
15th
year.
the
problems
which
might
come
up
as
to
costs
of
value
of
the
commodity,
the
supply
and
demand
situations,
all
of
the
facts
which
necessarily
will
go
into
a
determination
of
the
justness
and
reasonableness.
it's
not
just
one
clause
that
we're
complaining
about.
what
must
be
remembered
is
that
commission
has
stricken
all
clauses,
the
fertility
of
the
businessman's
mind
to
provide
for
the
sale
of
his
commodity
over
20,
30
or
40
years,
has
been
completely
set
aside
and
he
is
restricted
to
the
half
page
of
pricing
provisions
which
are
spelled
out
in
order
232a,
that
were
spelled
out.
well,
this
commission
still
insist
it
doesn't
know
how
or
what
is
the
test
of
a
just
and
reasonable
rate.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
we
have
no
contract
rights,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
in
our
case,
we
would
be
able
to
because
our
contract
would
expire
and
under
the
holding
of
this
court,
we
would
be
able
to
file.
pan
american
does
not
have
that
situation
as
i'm
sure
you'll
recall
there
is
this,
a
life
of
production.
they
would
never
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
rate
provision
doesn't
expire,
your
honor.
here,
they
--
there
is
a
fixed
escalation.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
each
five
years
and
the
alternative
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
what
pan
american
has.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
not
permitted.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
they
can't
make
the
contract
for
10
years?
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
because
if
you
read
these
rules
and
regulations,
your
honor,
you'll
find
that
the
commission
has
also
found
in
them
that
long
term
contracts,
20
years
and
more
are
in
the
public
interest
and
are
necessary
in
order
to
put
together
a
pipeline
project
and
have
financing
and
then
get
gas
to
market.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
so
on
one
hand,
we
must
have
them
but
we
can't
have
any
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
once
in
a
while,
you'll
get
a
distressed
sale
where
you
will
have
a
small
patch
of
gas
and
the
pipeline
will
--
will
take
it
at
--
at
some
distressed
price
for
a
period
of
five
years
or
something
like
that.
but
normally,
in
any
pipeline
project,
they
have
got
to
have
affirmed
commitment
in
order
to
get
their
certificate
from
the
commission.
and
the
commission
has
normally
--
these
long
term
contracts
are
actually
the
product
of
regulation.
we
have
been
given
the
requirement
on
one
hand
to
negotiate
a
long
term
contract
and
had
taken
back
on
the
other
hand,
the
ability
to
get
any
flexibility,
any
sound
business
prospects
for
the
future
while
we
do
this.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
mr.
chief
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
commissions
rules
orders
232
--
232a
and
242
appear
in
the
record
in
this
case
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
principally,
in
the
pure
oil
decision
of
the
commission
which
was
issued
at
the
same
day
as
order
number
232,
the
pure
oil
decision
is
reported
in
the
commission's
reports
in
volume
25,
it's
cited
in
our
brief.
that
--
the
--
the
order
232
on
page
13
of
the
record
refers
to
the
pure
oil
opinion
as
for
the
discussion
of
the
problem
with
which
the
commission
was
dealing.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes,
i
don't
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
now
i
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
387
which
was
an
attempt
to
review
order
242
itself
directly.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
242,
the
last
order
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
prescribing
these
regulations,
in
which
the
tenth
circuit
granted
our
motion
to
dismiss.
in
that
case,
when
our
motion
to
dismiss
was
put
over
to
the
merits,
we
did
then
certify
the
record
in
the
rulemaking
proceeding
in
which
242
was
issued.
not
the
record
in
the
rulemaking
proceeding
in
which
232
was
issued
and
not
the
or
--
in
the
yet
earlier
rulemaking.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
there
--
there
--
only
the
record
on
242
was
certified
in
the
other
case
to
the
tenth
circuit.
the
tenth
circuit,
we
feel
could
in
any
of
these
cases,
have
judicially
noticed
that
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that
record
does
not
contain
commission
analysis
--
commission
--
commission
appraisal.
it
is
the
comments
and
data
and
arguments
that
were
submitted.
and
most
of
those
comments
and
argument
and
data
that
were
submitted
were
like
the
argument
that
is
made
here,
it's
argumentative.
there
was
no
request
by
either
of
these
petitioners
in
any
of
these
rulemaking
proceedings,
in
the
rulemaking
proceedings
for
a
trial
like
hearing
for
an
opportunity
to
present
evidence.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i'm
sorry,
i've
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
you
will
find
there
only
the
comments
and
data
which
were
submitted
in
response
to
the
invitation.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
in
the
--
pure
oil
and
in
the
--
these
three
orders,
232
--
232
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
that's
right,
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
one
that
was
immediately
involved
in
the
pure
oil
case
was
a
--
a
favored-nation
clause.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
and
that
was
the
basis
for
the
consideration
of
the
general
question
of
these
indefinite
clauses.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
now
if
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it
proscribes
it
if
the
basis
for
the
redetermination
are
other
prices
that
themselves
have
not
been
subjected
to
commission
scrutiny.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
no.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it's
--
it's
--
you're
coming
very
close
to
the
memphis
type
of
provision
and
that
was
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
what
i
was
going
to
start
talking
about
because
you
had
asked
about
that
before.
that
provision,
that
type
of
indefinite
had
never
--
i
think
never
been
used,
that
was
--
that
was
not
known
of.
it
would
--
we
weren't
aware
of
it.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
at
the
time
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
no,
no.
let
me
come
to
that.
the
one
we
have
here
is
for
redetermination
upon
the
basis
of
other
prices
at
the
time,
an
average
of
three,
something
of
that
kind.
now,
the
commission
had
not
explicitly
considered
that
in
pure
oil.
it
invited
comments
after
232
so
that
in
effect,
there
was
another
rulemaking
proceeding.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
and
30
comments
were
received
to
argue
this.
and
on
the
basis
of
that,
the
commission
adhered
to
the
position
that
it
had
originally
taken,
accepted
and
modified
it
to
permit
these
--
these
indefinites
that
are
now
permitted,
redeterminations.
once,
not
more
than
once
in
a
five-year
period
if
they
are
based
on
rates
that
the
commission
has
had
a
chance
to
look
at
and
hasn't
questioned.
now
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
pan
american
can
have
what
it
wants
at
the
--
in
8
--
in
1983
or
in
1965,
if
it
will
provide
that
the
redetermination
shall
be
upon
the
basis
of
three
jurisdictional
rates
or
one,
if
they
want
to
make
it
for
that
which
the
commission
has
and
which
has
been
filed
with
the
commission
and
the
commission
has
not
suspended
it
and
hasn't
been
--
hasn't
questioned
it
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
--
in
a
certificate
case.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
the
text
of
the
order,
that's
right.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
now
that
complies
with
section
4
(b)
of
the
admin
--
the
--
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
which
says
that
in
issuing
the
rules,
the
commission
shall
state
the
basis
of
the
rules
and
the
purpose
sought
to
be
achieved.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
and
there
has
been
no
suggestion
that
it
did
not.
in
order
242,
state
the
basis
or
that
it
did
not
state
the
purpose.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it
is
what
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
it
is
solely
within
the
commission's
discretion
whether
two
and
if
anyone
asks
it
and
there
were
--
and
if
there
had
been
factual
questions
raised,
the
past
practice
of
the
commission
indicates
that
if
a
trial-type
hearing
is
the
best
way
to
resolve
that
question,
it
will
follow
that
method.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
it
has
voluntarily
done
so
and
times
passed.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
yes
sir.
it
has
--
mr.
howard
e.
wahrenbrock
i
can't
say
them
to
you.
my
definite
impression
and
i've
--
and
i'm
--
i'm
sure
that
i
could
verify
this,
is
that
it
has
on
occasion
used
trial
like
proceedings
to
resolve
questions
when
it
did
not
have
to
have
a
room
at
such
proceeding
so
far
as
the
statute
was
concerned.
it
certainly
can
use
that
and
whether
that
is
an
effective
way
of
doing,
so
it
will.
but
here,
the
provision
of
the
rules
permitting
petitions
for
waiver
to
be
filed
enables
a
company
in
the
case
of
a
memphis-type
provision
or
in
the
case
of
such
a
provision
as
mr.
gilliam
referred
to
for
an
adjustment
on
account
of
rising
costs
due
to
the
necessity
for
eliminating
contamination
which
may
occur
if
they
have
circumstances
like
that
that
the
commission
has
not
considered,
that
are
not
within
the
ambit
of
the
--
of
the
general
problem,
which
it
has
resolved
or
--
or
which
it
was
dealing
with,
then
it
can
apply
for
a
--
a
waiver
and
the
commission
will
grant
it
an
app
--
a
hearing
as
it
has
in
the
of
the
case
of
the
--
the
memphis-type
clause
itself,
which
atlantic
presented
in
a
petition
for
amendment
--
for
waiver
of
the
rule.
and
the
fact
that
there
has
been
delay
in
that
atlantic
proceeding
to
which
mr.
gilliam
referred
as
though
this
were
a
sham.
this
was
a
run
around,
the
commission
was
giving
the
companies
is
i
submit,
perfectly
explained
by
the
fact
that
when
the
examiner
took
that
case
under
consideration,
he
was
immediately
confronted
by
the
fact
that
the
rule
which
was
sought
to
be
waived
was
one
which
the
tenth
circuit
has
said
was
an
invalid
rule.
and
the
court
examiner,
i
would
suppose
is
waiting
up
to
see
what
the
outcome
of
this
decision
is.
thank
you.
