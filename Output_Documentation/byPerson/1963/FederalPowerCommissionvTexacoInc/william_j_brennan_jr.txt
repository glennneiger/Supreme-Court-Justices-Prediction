justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
wahrenbrock,
before
you
begin,
i
want
to
(inaudible)
if
i
could
ask
you.
we
wanted
to
find
out
why
the
commission
concluded
that
only
those
forms
of
chain
clauses
combined
with
232
was
good
and
everything
else
was
bad,
where
will
we
go?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
know
they're
here,
but
what
--
where
--
why
--
where
will
we
find
the
--
the
groundwork
upon
which
the
conclusion
is
reached
that
this
order
ought
to
be
in
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
that's
starts
to
which
this
(inaudible)
terms
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
find
out
why
this
was
done.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
--
that
suggests
another
question.
then
whatever
record
there
maybe
in
387
would
not
help
this
--
in
this
respect,
correct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
339?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
--
what
then
--
the
answer
is
that
the
record
on
242
would
not
be
helpful
to
us,
the
233?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
no,
i'm
sorry,
i
guess
i'm
not
making
myself
clear.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
whether
there's
anything
in
the
record
in
387
which
as
you
said
involves
review
order
242,
will
help
us
find
out
why
the
commission
promulgated
232.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
(inaudible)
--
but
i'm
still
trying
to
make
clear
to
myself
at
least
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
while
i
look
at
to
find
out
why
the
commission
promulgated
this
order.
now,
you
told
me
if
i
look
at
the
pure
oil
decision
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i'll
find
help
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
will
i
find
anything
in
the
record
in
242
--
at
242
and
find
it
in
387?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
know,
it
may
not
as
a
board's
appraisal
which
underlies
the
--
the
232.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
