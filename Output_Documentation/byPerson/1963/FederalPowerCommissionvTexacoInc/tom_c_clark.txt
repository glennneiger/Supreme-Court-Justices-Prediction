you

justice
tom
c.
clark
now,
i
didn't
understand
what
are
the
objections
of
those
1983
provisions?
justice
tom
c.
clark
(voice

justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
they
would
need
that,
wouldn't
they?
justice

justice
tom

(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
it's
not
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
how
do
you
reconcile
wisconsin
with
your
position?
justice
tom
c.
clark
not
in
the
--
this
court
on
those
general
policy
statements.
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
are
ceilings
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
are
in
effect
the
ceiling
on
the
price,
aren't
they?
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
--
general
policy.
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
won't
let
them
file
them
by
that
ceiling?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
i
understood
that
the
--
well,
the
policy
statements
say
they
fixed
the
price
in
a
certain
field.
then
they
had
applications
subsequent
to
that
that
were
in
excess
of
that
ceiling
on
that
price.
that
they
reduce
them
to
the
ceiling
price
before
they
would
certi
--
certificate
them.
justice
tom
c.
clark
yes,
just
an
area.
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
are
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
that
in
addition
to
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
that's
your
additional
price.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
understand,
of
course
you'd
have
a
right
there
to
--
i
suppose
on
the
permanent
--
permanent
certifications
to
have
a
hearing,
isn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
because
that's
a
directive.
it
operates
directly
on
the
price
though,
doesn't
it?
or
rates,
doesn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
yes.
justice
tom
c.
clark
this
doesn't
operate
directly
on
the
rates.
justice
tom
c.
clark
wisconsin
case
first
speaks
for
itself.
but
on
page
299,
that
statement
is
what
the
case
hold,
not
quite
what
you
state
because
its
--
commission
stated
in
that
case
absence
of
compelling
evidence,
it
will
certificate,
an
issue
would
raise
and
suspend
increase
of
rates
which
exceeded
those
price
level.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
suppose
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
there's
no
--
there's
no
barrier
into
the
statute
for
your
company
to
propose
rate
at
any
time
and
get
a
hearing.
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
actually
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
--
you
--
you're
talking
about
a
contract,
we're
talking
about
rates.
i
was
talking
about
rates.
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
i'm
--
comes
back
to
whose
--
was
this
an
act
to
--
for
the
protection
of
pipeline
companies
or
is
it
the
act
for
protection
of
consumers?
justice
tom
c.
clark
of
course
your
--
your
only
objection
is
that
--
this
right
that
there
might
be
a
deterioration
in
the
btu's
that
therefore,
you'd
have
to
readjust.
is
that
your
position?
justice
tom
c.
clark
that's
--
that's
a
--
is
that
the
only
provision
that
you
have
in
your
contract
that
they've
struck
out?
justice
tom
c.
clark
of
course,
you
could
go
under
4
and
--
and
(voice

--
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
after
20
years,
you
could.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
if
you
make
it
10
years.
justice
tom
c.
clark
yes.
