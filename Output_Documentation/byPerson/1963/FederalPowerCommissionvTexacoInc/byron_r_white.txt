was

well,

if

you

come

white
(inaudible)
justice

we
are
suggesting
that
the

this
is
just
a
guarantee
that
there's
going
to
be
a

and
everybody
knows
that
to
file
--
higher
those
rates,
there's
bound
to
be
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
a
contract
that's
for
20
years,
except
that
---
except
that
as
in
yours,
the
rate
provision
expires
in
10?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
assuming
you
had
a
contract
that's
said
at
the
end
of
10
years,
the
--
this
rate
expires
and
we
shall
--
we
will
renegotiate
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
not
permitted?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
have
them
in
less
than
20
years
or
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
the
board'
appraisal
except
in
the
pure
oil
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
in
the
text
of
the
orders
you've
served.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
did
the
--
the
pure
oil
case
cover
--
cover
all
types
of
proscribed
contracts
or
all
--
of
all
types

proscribed
clauses?
justice
byron

that's
right,
that's
right.
justice
byron

white
but
to
take
--
take
a
provision
where
a
contract
provides
for
a
definite
price
for
10
years
and
then
the
--
the
price
clause
expires
and
there's
a
provision
for
renegotiation
at
the
end
of
10
years.
justice

now,
the
commission
proscribes
that.
justice

that
is
out,
that's
impermissible.
justice

but
now

justice

so
that

so
that
if

if
you
had

that's
set
after
10
years,
the

shall
be
a

reasonable

yes.

on

that's
