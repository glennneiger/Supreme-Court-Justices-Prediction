justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
--
you
referred
mr.
wahrenbrock
to
a
waiver
--
a
waiver
provisions
in
these
regulations.
how
does
that
operate?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
a
company
wants
a
waiver
and
exemption
from
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
does
it
operate?
what
stage
does
that
come
up
(voice
overlap)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you're
sustained
in
this
case,
is
that
waiver
--
is
that
waiver
a
provision
now,
wouldn't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
functus
(voice
overlap)
officio,
would
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
would
be
functus
officio?
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh
i
got
the
impression
of
what
you
said
was
that
if
even
if
you
had
the
power
to
do
what
you're
claiming
here
that
nonetheless
if
the
company
could
show
special
circumstances,
they
could
come
in
and
ask
for
a
waiver.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
not
so.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
the
certificate
proceeding
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
if
you
prevail
on
this
case
and
these
companies
wanted
to
come
in
and
say,
"we
--
we're
entitled
to
a
waiver
and
should
have
because
of
special
circumstances,
would
they
get
a
hearing
on
that
(voice
overlap)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
would.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
suppose
they
have
to
make
some
kind
of
a
prima
facie
showing
--
a
paper
showing.
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
we
can't
decide
both
questions,
can
we?
if
we
sustain
you
on
this
and
we
don't
reach
the
merits.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
i
should
think
your
point
with
reservation
was
that
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
case
you're
arguing
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
venue
of
question
isn't
here.
we
haven't
granted
straight
on
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
in
other
words,
if
i
understand
it
on
what
you
want
us
to
do
is
to
take
this
other
case
that's
being
held
and
has
been
held
and
get
the
number
of
it
where
the
venue
of
question
is
presented.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
assert
and
then
decide
that
question
too.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
so
that's
the
question
you've
been
arguing
up
to
now.
justice
john
m.
harlan
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i'm
--
well,
i'm
still
confused
because
i
don't
understand
the
venue
of
question
to
be
presented
in
this
case
that
you've
been
arguing
now.
justice
john
m.
harlan
alright.
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
court
of
appeals
have
the
administrative
record
before
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
ones
that
are
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
if
the
commission
--
if
the
commission
prevails
on
this
thing,
i
--
i
just
think
somebody
has
to
take
a
look
at
that
record.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you'd
either
have
to
have
what
you
have
now,
renegotiation
or
you
have
to
have
a
memphis-type
provision.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
sort
of
a
record
is
there?
mr.
wahrenbrock
said
there
was
a
record
in
this
court
(inaudible).
what
is
the
record
before
the
commission?
did
they
make
findings
of
fact?
did
they
say
why
these
clauses
were
good
or
bad?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
i
mean
the
--
the
--
these
administrative
records.
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
an
opinion
written
by
the
commission,
the
findings
or
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
the
order.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
you're
complaining
about
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
isn't
it
more
than
that
--
isn't
it
more
than
that.
what
you're
saying
if
i
understand
it
is
that
if
you've
gone
through
a
section
7
proceeding,
the
commission
before
it
could
reject
these
clauses,
would
it
have
to
take
evidence
and
make
findings
and
then
they
would
be
reviewed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
the
commission
is
saying
that
you
got
the
equivalent
of
that
except
on
a
wholesale
basis
so
to
speak
under
the
rule-making
power
and
you
say
it
isn't
the
equivalent.
that
is
the
difference
in
substance
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
mean,
just
to
say
a
hearing,
it
doesn't
mean
much.
you
got
a
hearing
in
one
case
and
you
don't
get
one.
but
if
there
is
substance
to
your
position,
it
must
be
that
you
do
not
get
through
the
rule-making
power
the
equivalent
of
what
the
statute
gives
you
under
the
section
7.
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
that
this
--
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that's
why
i
asked
you
what
this
record
if
it's
in
the
court,
looks
like.
whether
there
are
findings,
whether
in
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
commission
is
using
the
rule-making
power
here
to
commendably,
i
would
think,
to
try
to
short
circuit
what
it
considers
to
be
a
volume,
an
enormous
volume
of
individual
proceedings.
and
it
--
it
can
achieve
through
that
whole
set
of
proceeding
if
you
want
to
call
it.
the
kind
of
result
that
gives
you
the
hearing,
that
gives
you
the
findings
of
fact,
that
gives
the
court
an
opportunity
to
review
what
the
commission
has
done
then,
it
seems
to
me,
it's
a
question
of
discretion
for
the
commission
as
to
way
it's
--
which
way
it's
going
to
proceed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
another
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
what
--
what
help
do
you
think
the
commission
gets
out
of
the
storer
case,
which
seems
to
me
to
be
--
neither
a
view
on
your
side,
you've
said
anything
about
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
brief,
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
how
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
is
that?
