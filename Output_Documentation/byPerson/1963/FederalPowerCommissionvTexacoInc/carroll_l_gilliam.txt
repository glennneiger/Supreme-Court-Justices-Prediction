mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
clarify
one
point
about
the
matters
of
substance,
i
am
appearing
on
behalf
of
pan
american
petroleum
corporation,
who
is
also
a
respondent.
as
to
it,
there
is
no
venue
of
question
before
the
court.
mr.
decrane,
who
will
follow
me,
will
respond
as
to
the
venue
of
question.
my
remarks
are
directed
solely
to
the
question
of
validity
of
these
regulations.
at
the
outset,
i
would
say
that
the
commission
counsel
referred
to
dean
landis
report
and
made
reference
to
museums
of
administrative
horrors.
in
our
view,
the
tenth
circuit
correctly
consigned
these
particular
regulations
to
that
museum.
the
important
thing
before
the
court
today
is
that
these
regulations
do
two
things.
they're
not
only
purport
to
declare
in
operative
and
therefore,
outlaw
certain
types
of
contract
clauses
that
historically
have
been
used.
they
also
prescribed
affirmatively
the
only
permissible
clauses
that
hereafter
may
be
used
by
producers
in
selling
natural
gas
in
interstate
commerce
to
pipelines.
the
commission,
therefore,
did
two
substantive
things.
commission
counsel
has
argued
primarily
a
form
of
procedure.
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
primarily
to
the
substance
of
what
the
commission
has
done
because
the
gist
of
the
holdings
of
the
tenth
circuit
relates
to
the
substance
of
the
orders.
that
holding
is,
first,
that
the
commission
has
no
substantive
powers
to
prescribe
or
proscribe
clauses
in
this
fashion
in
advance
of
its
review
of
the
contracts
as
to
which
it
is
acting.
the
tenth
circuit,
in
our
view,
correctly
read
this
court's
opinion
in
the
mobile
case
to
lay
out
the
dichotomy
under
this
statute
of
the
powers
of
the
commission
on
--
on
the
one
hand
with
respect
to
contracts
and
the
powers
left
to
regulated
companies
with
respect
to
contracts
on
the
other.
the
court
there
held
that
this
act
did
not
abrogate
contracts.
the
court
further
pointed
out
that
the
commission's
power
with
respect
contracts
is
that
of
review.
review
of
contracts
in
the
court's
language
made
in
the
first
instance
by
regulated
companies.
i
would
like
to
illustrate
briefly
what
in
our
view
is
the
proper
operation
of
this
act
with
respect
to
contracts
under
the
constructions
of
this
court.
we
are
not
in
the
position
that
the
commission
apparently
would
put
us
in
saying
to
the
court
that
the
commission
has
no
power
to
change
contracts,
the
questions
actually
are,
"how
upon
what
facts
in
applying
what
standards
the
commission
may
outlaw
contracts
and
then
prescribe
alternatives
in
substantives?"
the
substantive
order
that
is
of
most
importance
is
the
order,
denoted
order
232a,
which
appears
in
the
record
at
r20.
it,
in
a
few
lines,
declared
inoperative
and,
therefore,
outlawed
all
clauses
except
those
which
there
appear.
the
next
order
that
the
commission
issued
in
this
chain,
i
should
correct
the
reference
to
order
232a
begins
on
page
18
and
concludes
on
21.
the
next
order
of
significance
here
is
order
242
which
begins
on
page
22
of
the
record.
that
order
directed
a
bar
at
the
commission's
door.
and
it
specifically
says,
"that
anyone
who
comes
to
the
commission
with
a
contract
that
contains
a
clause
different
from
those
that
were
previously
set
out
in
the
order
232a,
is
denied
the
hearing
that
section
7
specifies
and
is
relegated
to
a
status
under
which
he
has
no
right
of
hearing,
he
--
his
contract
is
never
judged
under
the
act's
standards
and
he
is
told
that
the
only
clause
he
may
have
is
a
clause
such
as
that
set
forth
in
order
232.
and
those
clauses
themselves
have
not
been
tested
under
the
act's
standards.
there
has
never
been
a
finding
by
the
commission
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
is
served
by
the
clauses
the
commission
has
prescribed.
there
has
never
been
a
finding
by
the
commission
that
these
clauses
the
commission
has
prescribed
are
just
and
reasonable
which
is
the
controlling
statutory
standard
as
to
all
contracts
and
all
contract
clauses.
that
is
the
impact
of
the
two-principle
rule
orders
that
are
now
before
the
court.
the
specific
pan
american
sale
which
brought
us
here
is
a
contract
which
does
not
contain
any
of
the
clauses
of
the
type,
mr.
wahrenbrock
had
discussed.
the
particular
clause
that
brought
us
before
the
tenth
circuit
and
before
the
court
appears
in
the
record
beginning
at
r87
and
continuing
to
r88.
the
particular
clause
is
that
portion
which
appears
on
r88.
it
is
not
a
spiral
clause.
it
is
not
a
favored
nation
clause.
all
it
is,
is
a
clause
under
which
the
pipeline
and
the
producer
have
agreed
that
in
1983,
the
20th
year
after
deliveries
began,
these
parties
will
re-determine
price.
that
price
then
would
be
filed
before
the
commission
under
section
4
of
the
natural
gas
act.
the
commission
then
would
have
full
power
to
suspend
it
and
a
just
and
reasonable
determination
would
be
made
as
to
the
rate.
as
pointed
out
by
the
commissioner
who
dissented
in
part
on
the
first
issuance
of
order
232,
which
started
this
chain
of
events,
renegotiation
clauses
of
that
type
had
never
been
considered
by
the
commission.
they
have
never
had
a
hearing
as
to
such
clauses.
if
there
has
ever
been
a
commission
hearing
from
which
so-called
administrative
expertise
would
evolve,
it
has
been
solely
and
only
with
respect
to
the
so
called
favored
nation's
clause,
which
was
involved
in
the
pure
case
discussed
by
the
commission.
the
commission
has
never
considered
arbitration
clauses,
renegotiation
clauses,
redetermination
clauses
in
any
hearing.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
that
is
correct.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
no
fact
finding
hearing.
now,
this
is
part
of
our
problem.
we
agreed
that
the
commission
has
rule-making
power
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
rule-making
power.
there's
no
question
about
that
but
under
this
act,
there
obviously
are
certain
functions
that
the
commission
performs
in
certain
substantive
decisions
that
the
commission
makes,
which
are
not
susceptible
to
this
position
under
the
rule-making
process.
the
tenth
circuit
correctly
concluded
that
deciding
what
clause
is
just
and
reasonable
or
what
clause
serves
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
is
a
decision
that
requires
the
process
congress
has
specified
in
section
7
that
is
a
hearing
upon
the
certificate
and
a
testing
of
--
against
public
convenience
and
necessity.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
your
honor,
our
first
point
is
that
with
respect
to
contracts
that
are
in
existence
now,
the
commission
can
proceed
in
its
area
rate
proceedings
and
it
--
which
are
under
section
4
and
section
5,
it
can
proceed
in
consolidated
section
7
cases.
this
case-by-case
is
just
a
bugaboo
raised
by
the
commission.
these
things
historically
are
considered
on
a
consolidated
basis
along
with
a
pipeline's
expansion
project.
they
--
there
maybe
scores
of
producers
right
in
the
same
hearing,
the
same
record.
the
case-by-case
part,
i
think
this
court
can
lay
aside,
the
tenth
circuit
did
not
hold
that.
it's
an
exaggeration
by
the
commission
below.
and
here,
the
consolidated
approach,
the
court
has
left
standing.
it's
specifically
said,
"area
pricing
is
not
before
it."
now,
our
position
is
as
to
existing
contracts
and
clauses
in
those
proceedings
with
the
california
commission
there.
with
us
there,
the
commission
staff
there
and
the
technicians
and
the
questions
that
are
involved
when
you
prescribe
and
proscribe
clauses,
there's
a
fact
finding
process,
a
decision
consistent
with
the
statutory
standards
would
have
to
come
out
with
respect
to
contracts
that
are
not
yet
written.
as
we
read
mobile,
the
commission
is
without
substantive
power
to
pull
out
of
the
blue
the
clauses
that
will
be
in
those
contracts
to
post
the
rule
and
say
from
this
day
forward,
the
only
contracts
that
are
consistent
with
public
convenience
and
necessity
and
just
and
reasonable
of
this.
now,
our
reason
for
that
is
historically
this,
and
i
would
emphasize
just
and
reasonable.
that
is
a
rate
regulatory
standard
with
constitutional
routes
and
you
apply
it
to
facts.
you
don't
apply
it.
it's
still
unknown,
undecided
contracts
or
rates
not
even
in
deem.
as
we
read
this
act,
the
interrelation
of
section
7,
section
4
and
section
5
is
such
that
the
commission
has
full
powers
to
consider
all
of
these
clauses.
and
frankly,
i
do
not
know
whether
all
of
them
would
pass
master
in
a
hearing
under
the
act.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
your
honor,
in
our
view,
the
waiver
argument
can
be
dismissed
as
a
complete
sham
proceeding.
there
are
legal
problems
with
it
and
there
are
practical
problems
with
it.
the
legal
problem
is
this,
and
we
say
this
is
the
illegality
of
the
waiver
approach.
it
removes
the
decision
on
a
clause
from
the
statutory
standards
that
congress
has
set
up.
instead
of
having
a
proceeding
under
section
7
as
to
public
convenience
and
necessity
or
a
proceeding
under
section
4
or
5
where
just
and
reasonable
as
the
standard.
you
are
consigned
in
theory
to
a
so-called
waiver
process
where
there
is
no
standard.
it
isn't
even
written.
it
maybe
the
whim
of
the
various
--
i
don't
mean
this
derogatorily
but
commissioners
are
birds
of
passage
in
the
administrative
process.
it
is
removing
the
decision
that
is
made
on
the
most
vital
part
of
a
contract,
the
rate
fixing
provisions
from
the
statutory
standards
that
congress
set
up.
now,
the
practical
part
of
it
is
probably
more
important.
it
is
not
possible
once
this
court
decides
this
case,
assuming
it
affirmed
the
commission
for
a
producer
to
get
a
contract
upon
which
to
seek
waiver.
the
hooker
in
it
is
a
provision
of
order
number
242
that
applies
to
the
pipeline
companies
as
well
as
the
producers.
there
is
a
provision
that
if
a
pipeline
company,
which
has
to
get
a
certificate
also,
comes
before
the
commission
with
a
reserve,
a
gas
supply
that
is
covered
by
a
contract
with
one
of
the
so-called
odious
clauses
in
it.
that
reserve
and
that
gas
supply,
the
commission
will
not
consider
as
committed
to
pipeline,
that
goes
out.
now,
a
pipeline
cannot
get
a
certificate
without
a
reserve
showing.
in
fact,
it
also
cannot
get
financing.
so
that
places
on
the
other
side
of
the
bargaining
table,
from
the
pipeline
side,
an
impediment
in
ever
putting
that
pipeline's
name
on
a
contract
that
has
a
provision
other
than
this
that
have
been
posted
on
the
board
by
the
commission.
there
have
been
and
--
to
our
knowledge
in
this
vague
area
that
we're
in
now
until
there's
a
final
decision,
cases
that
i
would
call
flukes,
and
in
fact
that
two
that
are
before
this
court
today
are,
they
result
in
part
from
misunderstanding
of
the
regulations.
the
commission
had
referred
to
the
atlantic
two-way
route
cases.
texaco,
in
the
blue
colored
brief
before
you,
i
believe
in
the
appendix
has
set
out
for
this
court
exactly
what
has
happened
in
those
two
cases.
in
the
first
case,
a
so-called
hearing
was
started
and
all
of
the
evidence
with
respect
to
the
contract
clause
except
the
name
and
qualifications
of
the
witness
was
stricken
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
a
question
of
law
that
the
contract
complied
with
these
regulations
or
did
--
or
did
it
not.
all
the
evidence
was
not
even
received.
the
next
atlantic
clause
which
resulted
in
a
granting
of
rehearing
ultimately
resulted
in
the
fact
that
because
of
economic
and
business
compulsion,
atlantic
could
not
hold
out
and
it
no
longer
has
the
clause
and
therefore,
there
is
no
such
hearing.
it
is
quite
true
that
in
theory,
that
may
appear
to
have
a
gloss
of
some
type
of
out.
but
in
practice,
it
does
not
--
and
we
would
say,
even
if
it
purported
to,
the
commission
cannot
remove
the
testing
of
applications
from
section
7
and
from
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
test
and
make
the
standards
something
unwritten,
unknown
and
unstated.
it
also
cannot
remove
the
decision
as
to
a
just
and
reasonable
clause
from
that
standard
of
the
section
4
or
5.
i
would
say
quite
frankly
that
there
is
quite
a
bit
more
involved
to
the
problem
than
just
these
particular
clauses.
because
the
standards
of
this
statute
that
are
involved
here
and
the
test
for
determining
whether
a
clause
meets
the
statutory
standard
are
also
the
procedures
and
the
standards
that
apply
to
fixing
the
rate
level
itself.
there
is
no
--
would
be
no
difference
at
all
between
what
the
commission
did
here
than
setting
up
a
notice
as
it
did
here
in
giving
people
17
days
to
comment
and
these
comments
incidentally
are
not
served
by
another
participants
and
then
coming
out
with
a
rule
and
saying,
"these
are
the
permissible
rates
in
certain
areas."
now,
as
the
court
knows
in
the
wisconsin
case,
the
commission
has
come
out
with
a
statement
of
general
policy
that
sets
out
in
areas'
particular
rate
levels.
the
commission
bear,
makes
known
to
the
industry
that
if
you
come
in
with
a
contract
with
a
rate
that
is
higher
than
that,
you
are
going
to
have
to
go
to
hearing.
the
tenth
circuit
has
left
standing
in
the
same
posture,
this
order
232a.
it
says
that
the
commission
certainly
can
leave
order
232a
standing
as
an
expression
of
the
commission's
policy.
every
producer
in
the
country
is
on
notice.
you
are
guided
by
that
if
you
come
to
the
commission
as
we
did
with
this
renegotiation
clause,
operating
in
1983,
a
clause
that
is
not
accord
with
order
232a.
the
--
all
that
the
tenth
circuit
requires
is
that
with
such
a
clause,
the
section
7
process
be
followed.
now,
when
we
would
arrive
at
the
commission
with
that
clause,
we
of
course
have
the
burden
of
proof.
the
20
or
so
other
producers
were
involved
in
the
same
project
and
in
the
pipeline
would
be
in
the
same
hearing.
this
can
be
looked
at
in
relation
to
the
particular
area
in
wyoming
to
the
predictions
as
to
what
will
be
our
requirements
over
the
life
of
this
contract
to
have
access
to
filings
under
section
4
and
the
commission
can
write
a
reasoned
determination.
if
this
clause
falls,
then
the
question
then
is
a
substitute
which
would
also
enable
us
to
have
access
to
section
4
of
the
act
and
therein
the
form
in
which
we
may
attempt
down
the
road
to
prove
a
just
and
reasonable
rate.
in
our
view
substantively,
what
the
commission
has
done
is
create
a
straitjacket
which
it
had
no
power
to
do
in
the
first
place.
it
has
done
it
in
a
manner
that
the
act
does
not
commit
and
has
placed
us
in
the
position
as
we
are
here
today
before
this
court
with
no
record
upon
which
we
can
refute
or
respond
to
the
condemnation
that
the
court
heard
for
roughly
an
hour
of
these
contract
clauses.
as
the
court
may
note
in
view
of
the
holding
below,
the
only
record
that
is
before
this
court
today
because
of
the
way
the
commission
has
proceeded
in
its
view
of
rule-making
consist
solely
of
the
papers
that
we
filed
before
the
commission,
a
letter
rejecting
our
application
and
the
regulations
on
their
face.
there
is
no
record
here
from
the
rule-making
proceeding.
there
is
no
record
here
on
the
questions
or
to
substantiate
the
argument
that
mr.
wahrenbrock
made.
there
is
no
record
here
that
would
substantiate
our
questioning
of
the
statements
he
made
or
our
attempts
to
show
that
the
particular
renegotiation
clause
that
we
have
here
is
compatible
with
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
standard.
i
think
in
--
in
brief,
the
tenth
circuit
reading
this
court's
decision
in
mobile,
citing
what
this
court
said
in
memphis
about
the
importance
of
flexibility
under
this
statute
correctly
concluded
that
the
commission
is
without
substantive
power
to
prescribe
clauses
in
advance
because
of
the
nature
of
the
function.
it
also
correctly
concluded
that
when
the
commission
acts
as
to
clauses
like
this
and
bearing
in
mind
that
it
is
doing
two
things.
it
is
wiping
out,
one
and
prescribing
another,
and
both
have
to
be
just
and
reasonable
according
to
the
act.
when
it
is
doing
that
act,
the
tenth
circuit
holds
that
the
act's
specification
of
hearing
is
required
because
that
requires
fact
finding.
the
tenth
circuit,
likewise,
holds
that
the
standard
of
the
act
must
be
applied.
now,
the
tenth
circuit
has
looked
at
what
the
commission
has
said
and
has
correctly
concluded
that
everything
that
the
commission
discussed
in
promulgating
these
rules
could
be
accepted.
but
these
still
are
not
the
relevant
factors
that
control
determining
public
convenience
and
necessity
under
this
statute
or
justness
and
reasonableness,
both
of
which
are
standards
that
have
been
construed
by
this
court,
both
of
which
are
imported
into
this
statute
from
the
long
history
of
federal
regulation
of
rates.
and
they
have
that
history
back
of
them
whether
they're
being
applied
to
a
pipeline,
a
producer
or
any
other
regulated
entity.
now,
the
fourth
conclusion
that
the
tenth
circuit
reached
is
that
the
methods
that
the
commission
has
here
used.
that
is
a
so-called
nonreviewable
general
order
and
a
rejection
letter
operate
to
bar
the
courts
under
section
19
(b)
of
this
act
from
ever
reviewing
a
decision
as
to
propriety
of
a
clause
upon
a
factual
record.
the
record
that
is
presently
before
the
court
is
i
think
an
example
of
the
correctness
of
the
tenth
circuit's
opinion.
i
would
like
to
mention
just
briefly
what
in
our
view
the
commission
is
empowered
to
do
and
which
the
tenth
circuit
recognized,
because
we
are
as
much
concerned
about
how
the
commission
proceeds
as
it
is
the
commission.
first
of
all,
the
policy
pronouncement
method
which
section
16
would
permit
is
left
to
the
commission.
these
views
of
the
commission
as
to
a
specific
clause
are
left
standing.
the
commission,
likewise,
may
consider
these
clauses
or
any
other
on
consolidated
bases
under
section
7
of
the
act.
and
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
that
has
always
and
historically
been
in
relation
to
specific
pipeline
projects
and
specific
areas.
the
commission,
likewise,
is
left
free
to
consider
all
of
these
clauses
in
the
area
rate
proceedings
under
the
act.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
the
fact
that
today,
the
commission
has
already
in
operation
four
of
these
proceedings
and
those
four
are
said
by
the
commission
to
cover
75%
of
the
gas
that
is
presently
moving
in
interstate
commerce.
in
proceedings
of
that
type,
we
may
be
heard
persons
who
have
views
about
these
clauses
may
be
heard
and
as
i
said,
the
result
that
comes
out
would
be
consistent
with
the
just
and
reasonable
standard.
the
last
point
that
i
would
like
to
emphasize
is
that
a
long-term
contract
is
something
that
the
producer
has
to
live
with.
the
commission
requires
a
pipeline
to
come
to
the
commission
with
a
long
term
committed
gas
supply.
as
the
court
recognized
in
discussing
the
pipeline's
problem
in
memphis,
this
obviously
means
that
when
you
sit
down
in
1963
to
write
a
contract
that
is
going
to
apply
you
--
to
you,
and
in
my
client's
case,
this
will
be
the
next
30
years
until
the
gas
is
completely
exhausted.
you
are
going
to
have
to
have
clauses
that
permit
you
to
have
access
to
section
4
of
this
act
and
if
they're
going
to
have
any
meaning
at
all,
they
cannot
be.
our
guess
now
and
can
coning
specific
prices
for
1970,
1975,
1983
and
on
to
1999,
if
they
have
any
significance
or
meaning
at
all,
they
have
to
be
related
to
external
factors.
the
memphis
clause
that
the
pipeline
uses
isn't
related
anything
at
all.
it
simply
says
that
the
going
rate
and
the
pipeline
is
free
to
file
a
rate
anytime
it
sees
fit.
this
is
the
clause
that
was
before
the
court
in
memphis.
our
clauses
are
far,
far
more
limited.
our
view
is
that
after
a
section
7
hearing
and
after
the
area
rate
cases,
when
the
commission
has
finally
decided
what
are
the
facts
that
determined
reasonable
rates
under
this
statute,
which
is
this
court
knows
the
commission
has
not
yet
done.
when
that
is
done,
what
should
emanate
from
the
area
rate
cases
will
be
clauses
which
would
be
related
to
those
facts.
i
think
in
a
large
measure,
we
could
say
that
what
the
commission
has
attempted
to
do
here
is
wholly
premature
because
it
has
been
before
this
court
twice
in
the
past
two
years
telling
the
court
that
today
and
until
it
decides
that
the
first
area
rate
case,
it
will
not
know
and
cannot
tell
this
court
what
specific
facts
determine
reasonable
rates.
then
how
can
the
commission
today
or
in
1961
say
that
clauses
in
existence
are
not
related
to
reasonable
rates?
it
cannot
answer
that
question
until
it
answers
the
question
of
what
facts
generate
a
reasonable
rate.
having
answered
that,
it
then
can
look
at
clauses
and
if
the
external
facts
specified
are
not
relevant
to
reasonableness,
then
that
clause
may
fall.
and
what
the
commission
prescribed
that
then
should
be
related
to
its
reasonableness
factors.
today,
however,
it
has
done
this
completely
in
a
vacuum.
there
is
no
record.
there
has
been
no
finding
of
facts.
there
has
been
solely
comment
and
as
to
clauses
not
even
in
existence,
the
commission
has
attempted
to
exercise
powers
that
it
does
not
have.
in
our
view,
we
are
willing
to
sustain
any
burden
of
proof
that
the
act
places
upon
us.
but
we
believe
the
tenth
circuit
has
correctly
concluded
that
the
commission
here
is
guilty
of
over
reaching
and
that
it
must
be
channeled
back
into
the
section
7,
section
4,
and
section
5
process,
both
as
to
procedure
and
as
to
substantive
standards.
thank
you.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
yes,
sir.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
your
honor
the
--
what
we
call
memphis
type
clauses
are
used
by
the
pipeline
companies.producers
historically
have
never
had
such
clauses.
as
we
read
this
rule
and
i
think
the
commission
is
applying
it
that
way,
it
would
not
permit
a
producer
to
have
a
clause
of
that
type.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
that's
not
permitted.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
not
permitted.
the
only
ones
that
are
permitted
are
fixed
escalation
clauses
and
a
clause
that
actually
amounts
to
a
free
is
only
thing
that
requires
me
today
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
well,
let
us
--
let
me
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
suppose
the
initial
price
is
15
cents
and
it
provides
that
in
five
years,
it
will
go
to
16
cents.
that's
permitted.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
well
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
year,
the
producer
would
file
with
the
commission
a
notice
of
rate
increase
for
that
one
thing.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
the
commission
suspends
that.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
suspend
that
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
oh
yes.
yes.
it
has
right
to
suspend
the
rates
that
result
from
any
of
these
clauses.
they're
always
subject
to
that
and
they're
always
subject
to
the
refund
requirement
and
our
burden
to
prove
the
reasonableness
of
the
specific
rate.
we
always
have
that.
the
clauses
don't
remove
that
all.
they
merely
give
you
the
right
to
go
there
and
file.
without
them,
you
can't
file
at
all.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
i
don't
agree
with
that
your
honor
because
they
--
this
fixed
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
no
sir.
the
commission
says
that
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
there
would
be.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
five
years,
10
years
from
now,
that's
correct
or
ours
in
1983.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
that
time
but
the
rule
does
not
eliminate
the
"flood"
of
filings
because
it
permits
fit
--
fixed
escalations.
now,
this
can
mean
that
instead
of
our
1983
renegotiation,
we
have
a
fixed
escalation
of
tenure
every
year
or
let's
just
take
that,
1962,
1963,
1964,
1965,
1966
and
we
could
have
that.
and
yet,
every
time
we
--
we
got
the
right
to
file,
we
would
have
to
file.
in
our
view
and
in
fact,
i
think
if
you
tabulated
statistics,
you
would
find
that
the
flood
of
filings
results
more
from
what
the
commission
permits
the
fix
annual
escalation.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
no.
it
--
it
doesn't
--
they're
permitting
it
to
be
filed
doesn't
have
that
significance
at
all.
we
don't
contend
that
and
the
commission
has
clearly
held
that.
the
only
thing
they
look
at,
at
the
present
time
under
section
7
is
the
initial
rate.
now,
they
obviously
have
the
power
under
section
7
and
they
should
be
doing
this
is
to
look
at
all
the
other
provisions
of
the
contracts
and
the
facts
of
record.
if
in
that
hearing,
the
section
7
public
convenience
and
necessity
hearing
with
facts,
there
is
some
clause
down
the
line
that
may
not
relate
to
factors
that
determine
reasonable
rates
under
section
4
or
5.
the
commission
could
imposed
a
condition
that
that
be
taken
out.
but
in
so
doing,
they
can
--
they
would
have
to
permit
a
substitution
of
a
clause
that
still
left
access
to
reasonable
rate.
now,
when
it
gets
to
section
4
or
5
as
in
the
case
with
pipelines,
you
make
the
filing
of
the
rate,
you
have
to
justify
it
in
hearing
if
you
--
if
it's
five
years
from
now.
i
think
this
is
a
fundamental
of
public
utility
regulation
that
you
have
the
burden
of
a
continuous
just
and
reasonable
rate
and
you
have
the
right
as
well
for
that.
this
act
says
so
in
section
4
(a),
"all
rates
shall
be
just
and
reasonable."
it
also
requires
all
contract
clauses.
the
one
that
we
write
and
the
ones
they
prescribed.
and
without
the
hearing
we're
talking
about,
they
don't
know
that
what
they
have
hit
even
meets
the
statutory
standard.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
well
your
honor,
you
may
recall
it
in
the
phillips
case
on
the
basis
of
its
facts,
phillips
sustained
the
rate
levels
that
resulted
from
those
clauses.
now,
insofar
as
the
clause
itself,
this
again
refers
to
what
i
said
about
the
area
rate
cases.
the
commission
has
said
that
what
it
wants
to
do
there
is
to
come
out
with
a
price
in
the
area
for
gas.
the
so-called
favored
nation
clause
would
permit
the
producer
who
isn't
getting
that
price.
to
get
that
price,
i
don't
know
whether
it
will
be
compatible
or
incompatible.
this
is
what
i
think
we
need
to
find
out
and
the
commission
needs
to
find
out.
thank
you.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
not
in
the
two
cases
they
hear
your
honor.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
no.
there
is
a
pending
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
your
honor,
there
is
before
the
court
today,
a
case
number
387
which
is
a
petition
for
writ
--
the
pan
american
file.
the
court
below
granted
a
commission
motion
to
dismiss
our
petition
for
review
on
the
rule-making
record.
that
case
went
out
when
the
rule-making
record
come
out
with
it.
we
have
petitioned
here
for
review
of
that
decision
as
to
reviewability
of
the
general
order
on
the
rule-making
record.
it
has
not
yet
been
granted
by
the
court.
it
left
the
court
below
and
this
court
today
with
nothing
but
the
rejection
order
and
the
two
rules
on
the
face.
now,
that
is
the
commission's
construction
of
the
review
provision
of
the
gas
act.
it
contends
that
these
general
orders
are
not
reviewable
in
the
rule-making
proceeding,
and
it
has
so
far
succeeded
in
every
single
circuit.
so
you're
left
with
what
is
before
the
court's
thing,
to
review
that.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
well
--
first--
between
now
and
then
of
course
under
section
7,
we
would
be
issued
a
certificate.
you
assume
that
after
that
hearing,
the
producers
were
selling
in
this
project
would
have
the
renegotiation
clause
left,
the
1983
clause.
when
1983
came
around
and
the
price
was
renegotiated
by
us
in
the
pipeline
then
we
would
have
to
file
the
rate
with
the
commission
under
section
4.
there
would
been
the,
"i
don't
whether
in
1983
there
will
be
still
area
rate
hearings
but
there
would
be
a
hearing
of
some
type
under
section
4
or
5."
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
no.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
well,
our
contract
runs
to
the
life
of
the
lease.
it's
not
a
20-year
contract.
it
will
still
be
there
as
long
as
there's
gas.
but
of
course,
it
has
a
clause
that
says
economic
production
and
this
relates
to
rate.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
the
commission
does.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
no
sir.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
the
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
yes
sir
because
if
it
goes
out
now
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
well
your
honor,
it's
the
construction
of
the
act
in
relation
to
contracts
as
in
mobile.
if
the
day
we
signed
the
contract,
we
don't
have
the
contract
right
to
file.
in
1983,
we
will
never
have
it.
we're
bound
by
this
contract.
if
it's
taken
out
today,
it's
gone.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
no,
sir.
we
would
have
the
certificate.
it
would
be
on
this
contract
with
that
thing
ripped
out.
we
would
be
back
to
the
commission
when
it
permitted
but
it
would
not
permit
us
to
renegotiate
the
contract
in
1983,
and
would
not
permit
us
to
come
back
then.
and
that
would
be
our
posture.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
something
else
that
would
permit
us
to
have
right
and
trial
with
the
commission.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
no,
sir.
thank
you.
