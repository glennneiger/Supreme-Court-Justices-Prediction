mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
expand
on
a
question
just
ask
to
counsel
gilliam
by
mr.
justice
clark
as
to
what
would
happen
if
this
rule
were
sustained
because
there
is
in
effect
before
the
court,
substantially
and
basically,
a
power
question,
of
question
of
power
of
this
commission
under
the
statute
which
proscribes
its
responsibilities,
the
statute
which
was
written
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
this
court
has
said
on
frequent
occasions
that
under
the
natural
gas
act,
the
consumer
of
natural
gas
has
been
given
a
complete
and
comprehensive
scope
of
protection
against
exploitation.
but
let's
examine
that
for
a
minute
because
i
believe
that
it
cannot
be
denied,
your
honors.
that
if
you
sustain
what
the
federal
power
commission
has
done
here,
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
this
commission
tomorrow
from
issuing
a
rule-making
notice
stating
that
after
june
1,
1964,
no
contract
will
accepted
for
filing
by
this
commission
which
contains
a
price
that
exceeds
20
cents
per
1000
cubic
feet
or
a
price
that
is
less
than
18
cents
for
1000
cubic
feet.
now,
the
consumers
of
natural
gas
may
well
feel
that
these
prices
are
not
in
the
range
of
what
is
just
and
reasonable
and
may
seek
the
petition
for
review.
but
when
they
petition
for
review
from
this
rule,
that
is
finally
promulgated,
they
will
be
met
as
we
were
met
by
a
record
that
contains
absolutely
no
facts
whatsoever
by
a
court
of
appeals
which
says,
"this
is
a
bootstraps
operation,"
if
i
ever
saw
one.
and
by
the
monster
that
mr.
justice
white
was
afraid
off
when
he
wrote
the
burlington
truck
lines
decision
reported
in
371,
when
he
said
that,
"if
we
leave
these
agencies
solely
to
their
expertise,
we
shall
have
created
a
monster."
now,
you
said
this
can't
happen
under
the
natural
gas
act,
the
commission
cannot
promulgate
a
rule
or
regulation
that
says,
"there'll
be
price
of
20
cents,
a
minimum
of
18
cents
--"
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
if
i
put
facts
in
the
record,
your
honor.
one,
i
do
not
--
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
would
the
facts
be
in
the
record?
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
they
would
--
they
would
be
untested
facts,
unsworn
fact.
they
would
be
statements
or
comments
but
they
would
not
--
there
would
be
no
test
of
these
facts
under
the
rule-making
procedures
which
the
commission
follows.
i
would
not
know
the
facts
that
x,
y
or
z
put
into
the
record.
i
would
have
no
right
to
cross-examine
these
facts.
this
is
the
type
of
procedure
which
they
followed.
it
is
the
type
of
procedure
which
is
spelled
out
in
the
first
sentence
of
section
4
(b)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
you
will
recall
that
the
commission
said
that
there
was
no
contest,
that
they
had
followed
section
4
(b).
well,
that's
something
of
a
--
a
contortion
of
the
position
perhaps.
because
we
contested
the
fact
that
they
didn't
really
follow
4
(b)
but
we
said
that,
"you
didn't
follow
the
second
sentence
of
section
4
(b)."
so
saying
that
we
didn't
contest
they
followed
the
first
one
is
not
really
a
statement
of
our
position
because
the
first
sentence
doesn't
apply.
and
this
was
the
point
i
was
starting
to
make
a
second
ago,
your
honors
that,
why
can't
the
commission
promulgate
a
rule
or
regulation
that
would
establish
what
the
price
will
be
here
after
and
permit
no
challenge,
no
facts?
only
because
section
5
of
the
natural
gas
act
says
that
the
federal
power
commission
can
only
set
a
side
a
price
for
a
contract.
remember,
both
are
in
the
same
sections,
their
authority
over
the
setting
aside
of
a
rate
as
well
as
their
authority
over
setting
aside
a
contract.
they
are
both
spelled
out
in
section
5
(a)
of
the
natural
gas
act,
and
that
section
says
that
the
commission
may
not
set
aside
a
rate
and
it
may
not
prescribe
any
rate
or
any
contract
for
the
future
unless
there
has
been
a
hearing.
now,
section
4
(b)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
says
that,
"in
a
rulemaking
proceeding
where
some
other
statute
requires
a
hearing,
then
no
rule
can
be
promulgated
without
a
hearing
under
the
administrative
procedure
act."
now,
it
gets
a
little
complex
because
we
have
to
look
at
the
two
statutes.
we
have
to
look
first
at
the
natural
gas
act
which
sets
out
the
basic
powers,
responsibilities
and
scope
of
authority
and
then
we
must
construe
it
along
with
the
administrative
procedure
act.
back
in
the
time
the
administrative
procedure
act
was
passed,
mr.
justice
clark
was
serving
as
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
the
office
of
the
attorney
general,
and
the
department
of
justice
played
a
substantial
role
in
the
passage
of
this
legislation.
it
helped
congress
to
investigate
the
various
agency
procedures
and
to
offer
comments.
it
went
further
and
set
out
after
the
administrative
procedure
act
was
published,
a
handbook
for
the
agencies.
i
wish
to
guide
them
to
bring
their
rules,
regulations
and
operations
within
the
scope
of
this
new
legislation.
and
in
there,
the
pages
cited
in
our
brief,
the
attorney
general
and
the
department
of
justice
decided
what
sentence
1
and
sentence
2
of
section
4
(b)
of
the
apa
mean.
this
--
this
is
the
rule-making
provision
that
the
commission
claims
to
have
followed.
"there,
it
is
set
forth
that
where
another
statute
such
as
the
natural
gas
act,"
said
the
attorney
general
at
that
time,
"requires
a
hearing
before
the
promulgation
of
a
rule."
then
that
hearing
must
be
allowed
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
brought
out
before
and
chief
justice's
question
to
mr.
wahrenbrock,
there
is
no
record.
we're
bothered
to
mr.
chief
justice,
by
the
fact
that
the
commission
doesn't
know
how
many
of
the
filings
are
triggered
by
the
clauses
they've
precluded.
we
raised
that
point
in
our
brief.
they
don't
know
anything
else
about
any
of
these
clauses
either
and
we've
asked
for
an
opportunity
to
prove
it.
if
you
look
at
page
46
of
this
record,
you
will
find
in
our
contract
the
clause
that
prescribes
that
if
at
sometime
during
this
sale
which
will
go
on
for
some
20
years,
it
is
necessary
for
the
pipeline
to
treat
the
gas
because
it
becomes
contaminant
in
the
reservoir
and
it
is
produced
in
a
state
that
the
pipeline
cannot
take
into
its
system.
the
parties
will
negotiate
and
attempt
to
determine
an
adjustment
in
the
price
in
order
to
take
care
of
the
pipeline's
cost
of
doing
this.
now,
these
are
the
problems
we've
faced
in
trying
to
negotiation
contracts
that
are
going
to
be
in
effect
for
20
years
and
longer.
but
if
you
also
turn
with
finger
in
page
46
of
this
record
--
to
page
20
of
the
record,
the
page
to
which
mr.
gilliam
referred
you
earlier,
where
the
commission
has
prescribed
attack
on
the
church
door
as
it
were,
the
precepts
that
we
may
follow
in
writing
contracts,
you'll
find
that
this
clause
is
not
included
nor
is
anything
like
it.
you
will
also
find
in
the
record
and
you
also
heard
the
commission
tell
the
court
this
morning
that
there
is
no
economic
relationship
between
the
types
of
clauses
which
have
been
proscribed
and
those
which
--
and
--
and
a
producer's
problems
or
a
natural
gas
company's
problems.
what
more
direct
economic
relationship
is
there
than
the
fact
that
if
the
gas
becomes
contaminated
and
it
cost
money
to
do
something
about
it,
the
parties
will
sit
down
and
determine
on
the
basis
of
the
costs,
what
adjustments
should
be
made
of
the
price.
now,
you
heard
a
lot
about
spiral
clauses
and
favored
nations'
clauses,
but
you
didn't
hear
anything
about
this
type
of
clause.
but
this
is
the
type
of
clause
which
is
also
precluded
and
it
is
not
included
in
those
clauses
which
the
commission
has
prescribed
for
the
future.
we
claim
they
can't
do
it
because
there
is
no
finding
that
such
clauses
as
i
have
just
described
are
unjust
and
unreasonable
and
there
is
equally
no
finding
before
this
court,
no
record
that
you
may
look
to
as
to
why
the
clauses
that
were
prescribed
might
be
just
and
reasonable,
which
the
commission
must
find
under
section
5
(a)
of
the
gas
act.
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
your
honor
--
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
this
act,
as
i
understand
it
and
--
as
it
has
been
discussed
by
this
court.
one,
it's
suppose
to
have
provided
a
complete
and
comprehensive
protection
for
the
consumer
of
natural
gas.
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
and
also
--
excuse
me.
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
well,
i
tried
to
mention
him
a
minute
ago,
your
honor,
to
point
out
to
you
that
if
you
sustain
what
the
federal
power
commission
has
done
here.
the
next
time
the
consumer
of
natural
gas
appears
in
this
court,
there
will
be
no
record
upon
which
he
will
challenge
what
the
commission
has
done.
do
you
recall
in
the
wisconsin
versus
fpc
case
decided
last
term,
that
you
looked
--
mr.
justice
clark
particularly
in
the
dissent,
took
great
umbrage
in
what
the
commission
had
done,
stating
that
the
facts
of
record
didn't
support
the
approval
of
the
rates
that
have
been
approved
for
philips.
you'll
never
have
that
opportunity
again
because
if
you
approve
this
power,
the
commission
may
promulgate
prices
without
any
record.
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
the
record
before
this
court
--
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
the
material
in
number
387
--
well,
we
have
a
problem
and
that
some
matter
was
lodged
with
the
court.
we
have
a
dispute
as
to
whether
that
is
actually
the
record
in
this
case.
but
in
number
387
presumably,
the
commission
has
certified
as
the
record,
the
comments
filed
by
the
various
parties.
there's
no
evidence
as
such
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
no,
the
only
opinions
--
no,
the
only
opinion
is
the
order.
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
it's
just
these
orders
in
which
appear
this
rather
--
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
i
--
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
hope
that
it
is
not
--
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
we're
complaining
about
the
end
result
of
the
order,
not
the
proposed
order
--
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
--
for
in
here.
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
well,
normally,
they
write
an
order
and
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
they
must
make
findings
based
on
the
record.
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
there
was
none
at
all,
your
honor.
that
--
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
no.
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
no.
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
no.
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
we
had
17
days
to
put
in
writing
our
comments
on
whether
the
commission
should
or
should
not
promulgate
this
rule.
just
as
the
consumer
of
natural
gas,
mr.
douglas,
we'll
have
perhaps
17
days
in
which
to
say,
"he
thinks
20
cents
is
too
high
or
18
cents
is
not
a
sufficient
minimum."
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
there
most
assuredly
was
your
honor.
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
the
statutory
irregularity
is
that
this
commission
has
promulgated
pricing
clauses.
it
has
promulgated
contract
provisions.
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
yes,
there
was
no
hearing.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
procedure.
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
that
gets
very
close
to
the
difference.
it
has
almost
all
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
that
is
correct
(voice
overlap).
and
--
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
there
are
no
findings.
there
are
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
that
what
you're
asking
me
is
a
question
that
was
asked
to
mr.
gilliam
earlier,
and
that
is
in
fact
is
the
waiver
proceeding
really
--
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
-
that's
guaranteed
to
us
the
same
rights
that
we
would
have
under
the
natural
gas
act
as
originally
written
by
congress.
and
it
does
not
do
so
for
two
reasons.
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
we
have
discussed
it
at
length
in
the
brief
--
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
your
honor.
and
they
should
get
very
little
help
out
of
the
storer
--
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
decision
in
my
opinion.
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
well
essentially,
what
the
court
here
found
in
storer
was
that
the
action
of
the
commission
in
promulgating
the
rules
was
in
keeping
with
a
fundamental
statute.
but
that
is
the
exact
opposite
of
this
situation
here.
in
the
memphis
case,
this
court
considered
the
natural
gas
act
and
found
that
it
was
essential
for
natural
gas
companies
to
have
flexibility
in
their
pricing
so
that
they
could
keep
the
inflow
and
outflow
of
dollars
and
funds
generally
in
balance.
but
what
has
been
prescribed
here
as
you
have
heard
the
solicitor
of
the
commission
phrased
it,
is
the
elimination
of
flexibility,
the
elimination
of
flexible
indefinite
pricing
clauses
that
permit
something
like
that,
so
that
is
one
essential
difference.
the
holding
here
is
completely
at
variance
with
the
holding
below.
number
two,
this
court
found
in
storer
that
in
promulgating
those
rules
and
regulations,
the
commission
--
the
federal
communications
commission
had
in
fact
applied
the
statutory
standard
of
public
interest,
convenience
and
necessity.
there
has
been
no
application
of
the
statutory
standard
of
justness
and
reasonableness
in
the
findings
or
promulgations
here
that
certain
contracts
--
certain
contract
pricing
provisions
are
the
only
pricing
provisions
that
should
be
allowed.
in
other
words,
there
is
this
fundamental
variance
in
the
action
of
the
commission
has
taken
here
with
the
underlying
statute
that
did
not
exist
in
storer.
in
storer,
the
federal
communications
commission,
under
the
communications
act,
is
permitted
to
make
findings
as
to
the
public
interest,
convenience
and
necessity
without
a
hearing.
here,
the
natural
gas
act
specifically
requires
that
there
must
be
a
hearing
before
that
statute
may
be
applied.
therefore,
what
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
superior
case,
said
that
there
were
--
mr.
alfred
c.
decrane,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
and
there's
an
additional
point
of
--
of
substantial
variance
and
that
under
the
communications
act,
the
fcc
has
absolutely
no
jurisdiction
over
rights,
insofar
as
that
section,
the
broadcast
section
is
concerned.
here,
we're
talking
about
the
fundamental
problem
of
the
rate
that
a
private
party
will
be
allowed
to
sell
in
interstate
commerce.
that
to
me
is
another
substantial
difference
and
for
a
court,
such
as
the
ninth
circuit
did
to
say
that
there
is
no
difference
between
the
situation
in
storer
and
the
underlying
statute
than
--
than
there
is
here,
is
--
is
completely
an
error.
the
additional
point
that
--
and
another
error
of
similar
vain,
an
underlying
error
made
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
decision
on
this
--
on
this
similar
matter
was
where
it
stated,
of
course
the
commission
has
followed
the
procedures
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
i
tried
to
point
out
when
i
opened
my
remarks
to
the
court
that
they
had
done
precisely
the
contrary,
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
says
that
"in
order
to
promulgate
a
rule,"
and
mind
you,
section
5
of
the
natural
gas
act
is
a
rule-making
proceeding.
it
is
a
proceeding
whereby
rates
and
charges
for
the
future
will
be
handled.
that's
rule-making
under
the
definition
in
section
2
of
the
apa.
thus,
how
the
commission
can
say,
the
rule-making
statute
of
the
natural
gas
act
says
there
must
be
a
hearing
before
we
can
promulgate
a
price
or
a
contract.
and
then
say
we
don't
have
to
follow
that
rule-making
proceeding
because
the
apa
sets
it
aside.
it
most
assuredly
does
not.
the
administrative
procedure
act,
your
honors,
insist
that
where
the
underlying
statute
provides
for
a
hearing,
that
hearing,
that
taking
of
evidence,
that
development
of
fact
must
be
had,
one
in
order
to
support
findings
that
certain
clauses
should
not
be
permitted.
and
two,
in
order
support
--
to
support
a
finding
that
only
some
other
type
of
clause
will
be
permitted.
now,
your
honors,
in
the
remaining
minutes,
i
must
confess
that
i'm
the
guilty
party
on
the
question
of
venue
which
intrigued
the
court
during
mr.
wahrenbock's
argument.
texaco
filed
a
suit
in
the
--
in
the
tenth
circuit.
we
have
briefed
at
--
this
question
at
length
in
our
brief
and
we
feel
that
substantially
all
the
points
are
covered
there.
there
are
perhaps
two
that
i
shall
raise.
one
is
the
question
of
redundancy.
the
commission
places
great
weight
on
the
fact
that
if
our
interpretation
is
sustained
by
this
court,
there
would
be
a
redundancy
in
the
section
19
(b)
of
the
natural
gas
act.
i
have
two
answers
to
that.
one,
i
don't
believe
that
redundancy
is
inherent
because
the
natural
gas
act
defines
natural
gas
companies
as
anyone
selling
in
interstate
commerce
or
at
least
among
others.
that
is
done
by
individuals
as
well
as
corporations.
so
as
to
individuals,
there
--
if
our
--
there
would
be
no
redundancy
when
the
--
when
the
act
is
--
is
applied
insofar
as
this
point
of
resides
his
concern.
secondly,
redundancy
is
not
really
as
horrible
as
it
seems
because
if
you
look
to
the
general
venue
of
the
statute,
28
u.s.c.
1391
(c),
corporations
are
described
in
a
wholly
redundant
term.
they
are
described
as
where
they're
doing
business
or
where
they're
incorporated
and
it
--
it
--
it's
a
complete
overlap
that
congress
has
used
there
but
no
one
has
knocked
down
the
statute
as
being
invalid
or
the
fact
that
it
shouldn't
be
interpreted
as
it
obviously
reads.
and
that
section
is
also
helpful
on
another
point.
it
is
helpful
on
this
point
that
--
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
goldberg
who
asked
or
mr.
justice
stewart,
"what
was
so
awkward
about
using
the
term
"resides"
insofar
as
a
corporation
was
concerned?"
"why
do
they
have
to
switch
to
locate
it?"
we
insist
they
switched
to
located
because
they
wanted
to
change
the
meaning.
it's
not
so
awkward
to
use
residence
or
resides
in
relation
to
corporations,
thus
again,
28
u.s.c.
1391,
speaks
only
of
corporations
and
speaks
of
their
residence.
