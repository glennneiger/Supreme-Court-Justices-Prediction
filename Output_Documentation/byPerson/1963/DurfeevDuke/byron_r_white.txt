if
you
win

it
won't

in
missouri
or
nebraska,
you

and
if
missouri
brings

who'd
you
been
--
you
don't
think
she
would've
been
concluded
if
she
would've
been
served
by
publication?
this
was
a
quite
title
action.
justice

r.
white
although
the
defendants
here
had
been
cleared

they
would
have
been
permanently
and
forever
barred
from
re-litigating
it
in
nebraska.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
could
she

her
tenants
were

maybe
dependent
from

they
necessarily
were
residents
of
nebraska
under

he
could
then
go
on
back
into
the

the
nebraska
courts
then

re-litigate
it
again?

do
you
normally
go
behind
the
quiet
title

you'd
find

service?
justice

don't
you
