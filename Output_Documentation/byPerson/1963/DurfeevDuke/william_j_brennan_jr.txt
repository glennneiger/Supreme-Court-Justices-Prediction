justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
to
say
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
--
is
that
--
is
it
--
is
the
answer
you
just
gave
to
the
chief
justice
mean
that
you
say
your
title
is
good
whether
the
land
is
in
nebraska
or
in
missouri?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would
be,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
were
you
about
to
say
anything
about
the
original
action,
mr.
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
in
this
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
see,
what
bothers
me
is
and
on
your
premise,
this
whole
thing
depends
on
which
state
the
land
lies
in.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
can't
understand
how
this
litigation
has
any
status
at
all,
the
litigation
that
to
--
to
our
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that's
why
we
made
it
up,
that's
why
we
accepted
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
after
all
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
real
problem
here
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
that
--
was
that
--
if
that's
it,
i
--
i
take
it
if
we
would
appeal
that
the
subject
matter
is
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court
and
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
either
the
state
court
or
the
lower
federal
courts,
which
you
say
(inaudible)
wouldn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
law
may
mean
he'll
now
abstain
and
sends
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
real
can
of
worms,
isn't
it?
