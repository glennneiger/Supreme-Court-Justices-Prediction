mr.
robert
a.
brown
mr.
chief
justice,
gentlemen
of
the
court.
if
you
will
bear
with
me,
i'd
like
to
belabor
the
evidence
a
little
on
this
case
because
the
facts
should
findings
and
the
legal
conclusions
are
based,
in
my
judgment,
primarily
upon
a
rather
complicated
set
of
facts.
and
i
also
expect
to
point
out
where
mr.
ross
is
in
complete
error
in
some
statements
he
has
made
here.
now,
this
involves
title
to
approximately
808
acres
of
bottomland
which
lies
in
the
missouri
river
bottoms
shortly
south
of
what's
known
as
the
"little
old
bridge",
that's
the
railroad
bridge
leading
from
missouri
over
to
little
old
nebraska.
richardson
county,
nebraska
is
on
the
west
side
of
the
river,
missouri
is
on
the
east.
it's
true
the
river,
at
that
point,
lies
or
flows
south
and
easterly
but
i
think
you,
gentlemen,
will
understand
it
better
if
we
would
assume
that
the
river
flows
north
and
south.
we
can
then
place
the
left
bank
or
the
missouri
side
on
the
east,
the
right
bank
or
the
nebraska
side
on
the
west.
this
land
is
all
on
the
east
side
of
the
river
and
is
all
joined
to
holt
county,
missouri.
now,
prior
to
1855,
there
was
a
survey
in
1855,
prior
to
1855,
the
missouri
river
very
definitely
laid
at
the
east
of
this
land.
as
some
of
you,
gentlemen,
will
recognize
a
river
of
the
type
of
the
missouri,
a
meandering
river
has,
in
historical
times,
occupied
practically
the
entire
bottom.
the
--
i
would
say
the
bottom
of
that
point
is,
perhaps,
and
as
an
old
duckhunter,
i'm
familiar
with
it,
it's
perhaps
12
or
14
miles
wide.
there
is
a
lake,
a
big
lake
in
missouri
located
--
a
state
park,
located
a
mile
or
two
east
of
this
present
land
which
obviously
is
an
obstacle
remaining
from
one
of
the
convolutions
of
the
missouri
river.
so
there
is
no
question
that
the
river,
and
time
has
passed,
has
occupied
all
of
the
bottom.
in
1955,
it
had
moved
to
the
west
from
its
prior
location,
but
at
that
survey,
it
was
still
east
of
the
land
in
question.
now,
in
--
by
the
1930s,
the
river
was
entirely
west
of
the
land
in
question.
this
suit,
when
it
was
filed,
was
filed
not
only
against
julia
duke,
who
the
defender
or
who
i
will
call
"duke",
but
against
her
mother,
nelly
duke.
now,
in
the
teams,
duke's
father,
secured
land
lying
east
of
their
land
in
controversy.
this
land,
according
to
the
testimony,
began
to
accrete
to
that
land.
and
in
the
early
1920s,
duke's
father
was
raising
cattle
on
this
land,
making
use
of
the
land.
the
land
was
forming,
as
we
contend,
as
accreted
land.
duke
herself
began
curing
the
land
later
on.
she
got
a
swamp
land
title
from
missouri
in
1945.
mr.
durfee,
who
has
never
been
on
the
land,
that
when
mr.
ross
said
he
moved
the
house
over
there,
mr.
ross
is
incorrect.
a
house
was
moved
over
there
and
was
placed
on
land
belonging
to
the
cunninghams,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
this,
and
the
cunninghams
told
him
to
get
off
because
he
was
trespassing
and
he
got
off.
no
house
has
ever
been
placed
on
this
land
by
mr.
durfee
and
mr.
durfee
has
not
been
in
possession
of
this
land
and
the
record
will
so
indicate.
now,
when
this
suit
was
instigated
and
as
to
judge
blackman's
opinion
from
the
eight
circuit
clearly
indicates,
the
suit
was
not
only
against
julia
duke
but
mr.
durfee
claimed
he
owned
the
nelly
duke
land.
he
claimed
all
of
this
land
and
the
theory
was
that
the
river
in
1855
was
over
here
and
by
avulsion
in
the
1930s
that
it
leaped
over
here,
therefore,
all
the
land
in
between
remain
nebraska
land.
it
was
the
theory
of
the
dukes
that
the
river
moved
to
the
west
by
slow
degrees,
accreting
on
the
east
and
decreting
or
cutting
away
on
the
--
on
the
west.
now,
in
the
district
--
mr.
justice
goldberg,
asked
a
question
about
service,
julia
duke
is
not
a
resident
of
nebraska.
she
has
never
been
a
resident.
she
is
not
susceptible
of
service
there.
but
in
my
judgment,
she
was
badly
advised
and
she
went
over
there
and
entered
her
appearance
and
tried
the
lawsuit.
i
was
not
in
the
lawsuit
at
that
time.
but
she
did
go
over
there
and
consent
to
try
the
case
in
the
district
court
in
nebraska,
which
is
the
original
trial
court.
now,
in
that
case,
bear
in
mind
that
durfee,
who
had
never
been
on
the
land
and
who
had
a
tax
title
he
got
in
1956
for
something
less
than
$500
as
opposed
to
the
many
thousands
of
dollars
duke
had
spent
clearing
portions
of
this
land,
he
claimed
it
under
a
tax
title
and
the
blackman
opinion
points
it
out,
the
blackman
opinion
says,
no
--
in
so
many
words
that
defendant
gene
durfee
and
laura,
his
wife,
claimed
title
of
the
land
under
richardson
county,
nebraska
sheriff's
tax
foreclosure
sale
division
to
them
in
1956.
now,
for
some
unknown
reason,
when
they
talk
about
belaboring
the
evidence
in
judge
duncan's
opinion,
and
i'll
come
to
that,
the
district
court,
the
trial
court
in
nebraska,
in
a
very
cursory
opinion
consisting
of
approximately
two
paragraphs,
i
believe,
its
in
the
record,
divides
the
land.
no
rhyme,
no
reason,
no
statement
why,
but
the
court
finds
that
the
nelly
duke
land
is
missouri
land,
which
means,
therefore,
that
the
river
did
accrete,
move
west
slowly
at
least
to
that
point,
but
then
suddenly
finds
that
the
rest
of
the
land
is
nebraska
land
and
belongs
to
durfee.
it
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
and
it
was
tried
de
novo.
now,
bear
in
mind,
the
original
claim
of
the
petitioners
was
the
river
made
one
jump
by
avulsion
from
here
over
to
here.
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
tries
it
on
a
totally
different
theory
and
finds
that
by
some
hook
or
crook
that
the
land
got
down
between
nelly
duke
--
or
the
river
got
down
between
nelly
duke
and
julia
duke
and
then
it
jumped
over
here
west
and
then
it
jumped
back
again
to
a
form
of
shoot
but
the
land
remained
intact.
now,
that
brings
up
the
question
of
this
tree
which
mr.
ross
says
it
below
--
as
--
of
little
value.
there
was
a
state
forester
from
the
conservation
commission
of
the
state
of
missouri
who
testified
that
on
river
bottomlands
in
the
missouri
river
valley,
the
first
rule
is
(inaudible)
rules.
within
a
year,
trees
began
in
the
form
of
cottonwoods.
now,
bear
in
mind
that
this
land
was
suppose
to
have
existed
intact
from
18
--
1855
until
the
time
of
this
lawsuit.
the
cottonwood
germinates
about
a
year
later.
the
largest
tree
on
the
uncleared
area
of
the
land
was
cut
in
section
and
the
section
was
brought
into
court
as
evidence
and
it
was
aged
by
a
forester
and
it
is
undisputed
that
the
tree
which
was
cut
in
1959,
the
largest
tree
on
the
area,
lot
of
the
land
that
had
not
been
cleared,
was
35
years
old,
therefore,
it
began
to
germinate
in
1924.
and
quite
obviously,
the
land
could
not
have
been
in
existence
all
of
these
years
or
they're
very
deft
and
it
would
have
been
older
trees.
there
were
no
older
trees
on
the
area
which
substantiates
the
theory
of
accretion.
now,
after
this
suit
was
tried
in
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska,
and
as
i
say,
affirmed
for
what
reason
i
do
not
know,
i
can't
understand
their
language.
it
was
decided
that
this
was
neither
full
faith
from
credit
and
it
was
not
res
judicata
and
that
missouri
had
a
perfect
right
to
determine
for
itself
the
question
of
land
belonging
to
it.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
you
certainly
may,
justice
black.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
the
missouri
river
at
that
point
is
the
boundary
between
missouri
and
nebraska
and
further
south,
it
is
the
boundary
between
missouri
and
kansas.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
the
title
to
the
states?
mr.
robert
a.
brown
well,
the
--
i
--
if
i
understand
you
--
mr.
robert
a.
brown
it's
missouri
land.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
it's
nebraska
land.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
this
court,
the
supreme
court.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
it's
my
--
my
unqualified
opinion
that
either
state
has
a
right
to
file
an
original
action
in
this
court
to
determine
the
boundary
line.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
i
don't
think
it
can.
i
don't
think
either
state
can
render
a
final
judgment
which
will
affect
the
boundary
in
the
--
between
the
two
states.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
oh,
no,
no,
you
misunderstood
me,
sir.
i
--
i
say
that
neither
nebraska
nor
missouri
can
render
an
opinion
which
will
finally
determine
the
boundary
if
--
if
nebraska
and
missouri,
and
clear
information,
and
it's
--
mr.
robert
a.
brown
this
--
this
particular
case
depends
entirely
upon
which
state
the
land
was
in.
if
it
was
--
if
it
was
a
land
belonging
to
missouri,
the
opinion
of
judge
blackman
in
the
eighth
circuit
must
be
affirmed.
if
it
was
land
belonging
to
nebraska,
then
it
would
have
to
go
back
and
--
and
would
be
durfee's
land.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
i
am
asking
for
the
affirmance
of
the
opinion
on
the
eighth
circuit.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
that
missouri
had
a
perfect
right
to
determine
missouri's
--
the
title
of
missouri
residents
to
missouri
land
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
in
the
state
of
missouri,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
they
claim
the
same
thing
in
nebraska.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
yes,
it
does.
certainly,
though
because
that
--
that's
the
basic
and
that's
the
reason
i'm
pointing
out
all
--
all
of
these
evidence.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
well,
the
--
the
original
action
in
nebraska?
mr.
robert
a.
brown
i
think
to
determine
the
actual
boundary
between
the
two
states,
nebraska
and
missouri,
an
action
would
have
to
be
filed
by
one
of
the
states
in
this
court.
as
i
understand
it,
this
court
has
original
jurisdiction
of
boundary
disputes.
now,
i
was
about
to
say
that
it
is
common
knowledge
and
it
is
pointed
out
in
mr.
ross's
reply
brief
that
there
is
a
whole
host
of
trouble
brewing
between
nebraska
and
missouri
and
the
governors
of
the
two
states
are
attempting
to
get
together
a
commission
to
settle
boundary
line
disputes
but
that
is
causing
the
barn
door
after
the
horse
has
been
stolen
so
far
as
we
are
concerned.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
no
question
about
it.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
well,
you
gentlemen
accept
the
certiorari.
i
can't
understand
it
either
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
a.
brown
well,
that
--
that
may
well
be
and
that's
the
reason
i'm
here
to
try
and
prove
to
you
that
you
were
mistaken
and
you're
accepting
it.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
i
want
you
to
hold,
justice
black.
i
think
it
is
correct
that
we
are
not
bound
by
res
judicata
our
full
faith
and
credit,
that
we
have
the
same
--
mr.
robert
a.
brown
obviously
not
and
in
a
case
cited
here
and
i
have
--
mr.
robert
a.
brown
you
--
you
settle
nothing
so
far
as
the
boundary
line
between
the
two
states
is
concerned.
you
do
settle
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
that
this
should
go
back
to
the
original
trial
judge,
judge
duncan,
for
further
proceedings
and
accordance
with
his
opinion.
he
then
can
make
a
factual
finding
as
to
who
owns
it
and
that
if
mr.
durfee
sees
fit,
can
again
be
appealed
to
the
eighth
circuit
on
the
factual
finding
and
ultimately
may
come
before
this
court
for
a
final
determination.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
no,
i
don't
think
he
could
mr.
--
sir,
mr.
white.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
well,
i
think
when
you
get
a
final
decision
on
the
facts,
if
you
--
if
they
seem
to
pursue
that,
in
the
supreme
court
in
united
states,
i
think
that
would
be
binding
on
everybody.
i
don't
believe
anybody
else
would
question.
you
see
this,
all
of
this
stuff
--
mr.
robert
a.
brown
well,
you
--
mr.
ross
was
asked
whether
you
can
obtain
it
from
the
supreme
court
in
nebraska.
i
was
not
in
the
litigation
at
that
time
and
i
don't
know.
i
--
it's
my
judgment
that
very
probably,
there
--
there
could've
been
an
attempt
to
bring
it
to
this
court
at
that
time.
i'm
quite
certain
that
the
case
could
have
been
removed
to
the
federal
court
in
nebraska
to
start
with
and
from
there,
going
to
the
--
that
would
be
the
eighth
circuit
and
then
we'll
come
up
but
that
was
not
done.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
yes,
mr.
harlan.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
rules
(inaudible).
mr.
robert
a.
brown
i
think
you
would.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
yes,
mr.
harlan.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
no,
i
--
i'm
sorry.
i
--
i'm
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
a.
brown
i
don't
think
i
will
change
the
effect
of
this,
justice
harlan.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
i
don't
think
it
would
affect
it.
justice,
i
--
i
think,
if
--
if
you
reverse
the
eighth
circuit
and
affirm
the
nebraska
opinion
and
later
there
is
litigation
--
mr.
robert
a.
brown
--
between
missouri
and
nebraska,
you
determine
its
missouri
land,
again,
i
say
it's
closing
the
door
after
--
mr.
robert
a.
brown
--
(voice
overlap)
it's
too
late
to
help
up.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
that
is
--
i
agree.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
yes,
mr.
goldberg.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
because
there
is
a
case
from
the
district
court
of
nebraska,
recently
affirmed
in
the
eighth
circuit
in
an
opinion
by
judge
matthes
and
i
have
the
opinion
here.
it
is
trader
versus
171
industrial
7400
acres
of
land,
more
or
less.
now,
in
that
case,
there
had
been
adjudication
in
iowa.
the
certain
land
on
the
iowa
side
of
missouri
river
belongs
to
iowa
and
the
parties
had
litigated
it
in
iowa.
nevertheless,
they
went
over
to
nebraska
and
it
was
the
--
the
trial
in
nebraska
judgment
or
the
iowa
judgment
in
nebraska
and
nebraska
did
what
they
say
we
can't
do
in
this
case.
and
nebraska
examined
the
jurisdictional
question
and
say,
"uh-uh,
iowa
was
wrong,
this
is
nebraska
land."
the
iowa
judgment
is
not
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit,
is
not
res
judicata
and
they
found
it
was
nebraska
land.
then
the
united
states
government
condemned
the
portion
of
the
land
and
it
was
tried
in
the
federal
court
and
that's
the
questions
that
went
up
and
the
federal
court
says
that
where
there
has
been
litigation
like
this
where
its
tried
once
and
then
we
litigate
it
in
another
state,
it
was
re-litigated
the
third
time,
the
second
decision
and
binding.
and
if
--
mr.
robert
a.
brown
sir?
mr.
robert
a.
brown
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
my
client
traces
her
title
to
what
is
known
as
a
"swamp
land
patent"
from
holt
country,
missouri.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
in
missouri.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
to
a
tax
deed,
tax
foreclosure
deed
given
11
years
later
with
the
state
of
nebraska.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
(inaudible)
mr.
robert
a.
brown
the
deed
was
no
good.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
the
deed
was
no
good.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
absolutely,
that's
the
--
that's
the
crux
of
the
whole
case.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
perhaps
my
--
mr.
robert
a.
brown
i'll
take
it
on,
if
it
was
fine.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
oh,
there
was
voluminous
evidence
--
mr.
robert
a.
brown
--
particularly
in
the
second
trial.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
oh,
no.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
no.
judge
duncan,
when
he
handed
down
an
opinion
and
this
was
brought
out
by,
i
believe
it
was
mr.
stewart
or
perhaps,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
judge
duncan
handed
down
an
18
page
written
opinion
and
for
16
pages,
he
belabored
the
evidence.
and
--
and
this
is
quite
significant,
four
separate
times,
he
used
the
term,
and
i
quote
this
to
you
because
it's
important.
he
says,
"it
is
clear
that
the
land
was
--
to
me,
the
evidence
clearly
reveals
that
prior
to
the
cut
through
and
the
formation
of
the
shoot,
the
main
channel
goes
to
the
south
and
west
of
the
land
in
controversy.
again,
i
am
convinced
the
evidence
clearly
shows
that
prior
to
the
formation
of
the
island
in
controversy,
the
main
channel
of
the
river
was
to
the
south
and
west
thereof."
two
more
quotes.
i
won't
take
the
time
and
read
where
he
says
clearly,
the
land
--
the
river
was
west
of
it
and
it
was
missouri
land.
now,
having
belabored
the
evidence
for
16
pages,
he
then
says
with
much
reluctance,
"i
am
concluded
to
find
that
not
full
faith
and
credit
applies
but
res
judicata
does
apply."
mr.
robert
a.
brown
oh,
yes,
yes,
i
sometimes
go
behind
quiet
title
decrees
and
i
--
i
check
title
(inaudible).
mr.
robert
a.
brown
i
think
a
quiet
title
action,
if
you
want
to
get
into
the
interior
of
the
state
is
good,
unfortunately,
we
have
so
much
trouble
with
the
shifting
of
a
land
in
missouri
river
bottoms
and
we
are
definitely
right
on
the
border
there
that
quiet
title
action
is
very
frequently,
in
my
judgment,
are
not
worth
to
pay
for
the
original
and
i
think
this
is
a
good
example
of
one
that's
working
that.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
no,
i
don't
think
it
should
be
that
way.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
i
think
--
mr.
robert
a.
brown
i
think
what
should
be
done
is
that
missouri
and
nebraska
should
get
up
of
their
honkers,
if
you
pardon
the
expression
--
mr.
robert
a.
brown
--
and
have
a
commission
as
we
did
with
the
state
of
kansas
and
settle
the
--
mr.
robert
a.
brown
they
have
not
done
it
so
far.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
we're
not
the
only
ones.
there
--
mr.
robert
a.
brown
you
see,
nebraska
had
a
law
--
all
--
all
nebraska
had
to
do
was
to
come
along
and
arbitrarily
put
some
land
on
the
books
as
nebraska
land
and
then
they
have
it
taxed
and
nobody
pays
the
taxes
for
a
couple
of
years
and
then
it's
sold
for
taxes.
and
they
have
a
lady
district
attorney
in
one
of
the
county's
(inaudible).
she
is
taking
--
she's
doing
what
governor
morris
has
asked
her
not
to
do.
she's
constantly
putting
land,
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
as
an
illustration
no,
but
we're
up
against.
so
there
is
constant
litigation
over
these
boundary
lands.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
whatever
happens
here,
neither
state
is
concluded
as
to
the
boundary.
that
is
why
--
mr.
robert
a.
brown
they
can
have
their
original
action.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
that
is
correct.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
state
of
missouri
has
filed
brief
on
this.
the
state
of
nebraska
filed
brief,
which
had
very
little
to
say
except
--
while
it
--
it
more
--
has
filed
the
brief
of
the
petitioner,
the
state
of
missouri
has
come
up
with
a
very
interesting
and
novel
brief,
which
i
am
frank
to
say
i
never
considered
to
my
standpoint,
judge
duncan
didn't
consider
and
while
i
have
the
highest
respect
was
the
blackman
opinion
as
you
can
judge
from
the
way
i've
mentioned
it.
judge
blackman
didn't
catch
him.
and
the
state
of
missouri
has
pointed
out
that
by
statute
and
decision,
now,
bear
in
mind
to
file
in
the
federal
court
in
missouri
is
bound
by
missouri
law.
and
by
statute
ends
decision
of
the
supreme
court
in
the
state
of
missouri,
the
title
of
the
real
estate
in
missouri
can
only
be
determined
by
the
circuit
court
of
the
county
in
which
the
land
lies.
any
other
decision
is
a
nullity
and
void
as
neither
res
judicata
nor
full
faith
and
credit.
and
the
supreme
court
in
missouri
has
said
that
repeatedly
and
the
cases
are
all
in
there.
now,
the
attorney
general
makes
the
argument.
he
says
it's
true,
nebraska
has
decided.
a
nebraska
court
had
said
that
a
nebraska
resident
has
a
nebraska
title
to
nebraska
land.
but
he
said
that
and
bother
us,
a
missouri
court
has
the
same
right
to
say
that
a
missouri
resident
has
a
missouri
title
to
missouri
land.
and
i
think
that
makes
sense.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
what?
mr.
robert
a.
brown
not
my
judgment.
see,
all
i
have
is
a
judgment
that
--
mr.
robert
a.
brown
--
that
--
in
the
eight
circuit
that
judge
duncan
should
--
was
not
pre
--
precluded
from
considering
this
by
res
judicata.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
it's
up
to
--
it's
up
to
judge
duncan
to
make
such
finding
as
he
feels
he
should
from
the
facts.
of
course,
what
he
thinks
is
right.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
it
is
the
(inaudible)
dismiss
i've
ever
gotten
into
on
a
legal
proposition.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
this
on
my
time
--
mr.
robert
a.
brown
well,
alright,
judge.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
that
case
is
cited
in
the
brief.
you
--
mr.
robert
a.
brown
--
you'll
have
no
trouble
finding
it.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
let
me
see
if
i
can
give
it
to
you.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
it's
this
u.s.
versus
--
here,
bottom
of
page
18
and
the
top
of
page
19.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
my
--
my
brief,
brief
of
the
respondent.
now,
what
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
you,
gentlemen,
i
or
as
i
say,
i
believe
between
us,
we've
--
we've
covered
all
the
cases
and
there
isn't
a
single
case
involving
title
real
estate
that
says
a
sovereign
state
is
precluded
by
res
judicata
from
determining
jurisdiction.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
from
your
court.
it
goes
back
to
comment
on
story's
commentaries
where
he
says,
"absolutely,
the
state
and
its
own
right
has
a
right
to
pass
on
its
question
of
jurisdiction
and
it
is
not
foreclosed."
full
faith
and
credit
is
merely
an
evidentiary
matter.
if
the
original
judgment
was
void,
it's
a
nullity
and
carries
no
weight.
a
res
judicata
is
in
the
same
category
if
the
--
if
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
no,
sir.
and
the
cases
do
not
indicate
that.
mr.
robert
a.
brown
and
the
interesting
thing
is
that
--
no,
i
won't
have
time
to
go
through
all
of
these
cases.
i've
tried
analyzing
the
brief
and
i'll
have
to
trust
you,
gentlemen,
to
read
zealously
as
i
worked
on.
but
i
would
say
this,
that
in
the
--
the
crux
of
the
whole
thing
is,
there
is
a
--
there
are
two
policies,
as
judge
blackman
pointed
out,
the
policy
in
favor
of
the
curtail
of
ending
a
litigation
and
the
policy
in
--
in
favor
of
letting
a
state
determine
its
own
--
its
own
sovereign
rights.
and
in
the
reinstatement
of
the
law
in
1943,
under
judgment,
there
was
--
there
were
five
reasons
where
this
wouldn't
standup.
at
the
same
time
under
conflicts,
conflicts
didn't
say
that
but
it
said,
"we
express
no
opinion
whether
and
how
far
--
far
you're
appearing
and
participating
in
the
proceedings.
it's
precluded
from
many
questions,
the
jurisdiction,
the
court
or
the
subject
matter,"
that's
1943.
in
1948,
in
the
restatement
of
--
of
the
law
of
conflicts
that
caveat
has
been
removed
and
they
have
copied
exactly
what
it
says
in
judgments.
and
in
that,
they
say
where
a
court
is
jurisdictional
with
the
parties,
it
says
it
has
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter.
there
--
among
others,
there
are
five
things
which
weigh
heavily
why
that
does
not
standup
or
why
it
does
not
res
judicata.
one,
is
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
was
clear.
judge
duncan
four
times
and
said
there
was
no
question.
it
is
clear.
the
fifth
is
the
policy
against
the
court's
acting
beyond
its
jurisdiction
is
strong.
you,
gentlemen,
in
many
of
your
decisions
which
i
have
cited,
have
repeatedly
said
that
that
policy
is
strong.
now,
there
is
an
argument
here
that
there
must
be
an
end
to
litigation.
i
--
this
--
well,
it
has
intrigued
me
and
might
intrigue
some
of
you.
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
has
been
just
as
zealous
as
this
court
in
protecting
the
rights
of
individuals.
i
say
the
rights
of
individuals
are
paramount
when
it
comes
to
the
question
as
to
whether
they
should
be
curtailed
or
litigations
should
be
curtailed.
and
in
the
earlier
1840s,
prior
to
the
civil
war,
a
colored
slave
with
the
name
of
charlotte
sued
the
chouteau
family
in
st.
louis,
which
was
then
the
leading
family
in
st.
louis,
to
have
her
declared
free
and
no
longer
a
slave
and
she
contended
she'd
been
to
canada
where
--
where
slavery
was
not
acknowledged
and
was,
therefore,
emancipated.
four
times,
somebody
put
up
the
money
for
her
to
fight
that
in
the
circuit
court
of
st.
louis.
four
times,
she
went
to
the
supreme
court.
three
times
the
supreme
court
--
the
first
two
times
she
lost
it.
in
both
times
to
protect
her
rights,
the
supreme
sent
it
back.
the
third
time,
she
won
it
and
chouteau
appealed
and
the
supreme
court
sent
it
back
in
the
fourth
time.
and
i
have
cited
that
charlotte
versus
chouteau.
there
--
there
are
four
different
decisions
showing
that
our
courts
have
zealously
put
the
rights
of
an
individual
far
and
above
the
desired
curtail
litigation.
gentlemen,
i've
taken
all
my
time
and
(inaudible),
i
want
to
go
out
in
nebraska
presence
to
be
honest
with
you.
so
i'll
thank
you
and
i
hope
you'll
find
that
there
is
some
merit
in
our
presentation.
i
believe
you
have
considered
--
you
agree
that
the
eighth
circuit
is
correct.
