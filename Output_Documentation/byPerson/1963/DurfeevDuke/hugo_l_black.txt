justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
really
the
boundary
between
the
two
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
the
title
depend
on
as
to
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
the
title
of
anyone
of
this
land
depend
on
as
to
the
states?
what
relations
do
they
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it's
in
missouri?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
it's
in
nebraska?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
court
has
jurisdiction
to
determine
that
boundary
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
your
argument
that
one
of
the
two
states
can
do
it
or
that
others
can
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
lacking
that,
how
can
either
one
of
the
states
or
in
the
judgment
that's
final
in
determining
the
boundaries?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
had
an
idea
that
one
of
you
was
saying
if
nebraska
could
do
it
and
the
other
one
was
saying
missouri
could
do
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
does
the
--
does
the
--
who
own
--
does
this
depend
entirely
on
which
state
it's
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you're
asking
for
the
affirmance
of
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
ground
that
he
has
--
that
court
had
a
right
to
determine
that
it
was
land
belonging
to
missouri?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they're
claiming
the
same
thing
with
reference
to
nebraska?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
finally
gets
back
to
which
state
the
lands
in,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
want
us
to
all
hold
the
state
case
that
is
in
your
state.
the
other
people
want
us
to
hold
this
in
that
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
them,
about
this
statement?
would
they
be
bound
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
you
say
that
this
is
not
to
be
given
full
faith
and
credit
and
neither
is
there,
so
we'd
settle
nothing
do
we?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
can
we
take
it
from
an
appellate
--
from
a
state
court
or
do
we
have
to
do
it
originally
that
i'm
suggesting?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
but
you
are
through
when
you
get
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
want
to
ask
you
about
justice
harlan's
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
do
not
see
how,
if
i
understand
the
record
correctly,
your
answer
could
possibly
be
correct.
to
what
source
does
your
client
trace
his
title?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
missouri?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
what
source
does
your
antagonist
trace
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
nebras
--
if
that
land
was
not
in
nebraska
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
that
a
good
title?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
your
land
was
not
in
missouri
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
so
that
it
does
affect
as
to
--
as
to
bound
the
effect,
the
case
as
to
who
--
which
state
that
land
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
--
does
your
client
have
tax
title?
justice
hugo
l.
