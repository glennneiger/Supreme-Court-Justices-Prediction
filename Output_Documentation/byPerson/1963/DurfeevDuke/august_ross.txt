mr.
august
ross
mr.
chief
justice,
gentlemen.
this
controversy
had
its
inception
about
1956
in
the
filing
of
acquired
title
suit
in
richardson
county,
nebraska
is
most
quite
title
suits
went,
there
was
no
big
difference
that
involved.
however,
the
defense
by
the
defendants
of
the
property
was
without
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
that
is
in
the
adjoining
state
of
missouri,
it
was
river
bottom
ground.
the
defendant
was
served
with
process
and
the
defendant
appeared
in
the
nebraska
suit,
specifically
set
up
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
that
is
the
contention
that
the
ground
was
situate
within
the
state
of
missouri
and
therefore,
the
state
of
nebraska
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
she
offered
evidence,
she
testified
personally.
it
--
mr.
august
ross
none,
your
honor.
mr.
august
ross
i
understand
there's
no
such
contention.
and
that
there
was
a
decision
of
the
district
court
of
douglas
--
of
richardson
county,
nebraska
affirming
the
title
of
the
plaintiff
which
was
based
on
a
tax
deed
and
deeds
from
other
individuals
of
record.
then,
the
missouri
claimant,
if
i
may
refer
to
her
as
such,
prosecuted
an
appeal
to
the
nebraska
supreme
court.
and
under
nebraska
procedure
in
an
equity
action,
the
trial
is
de
novo.
and
she
has
then
a
new
and
complete
review
of
the
evidence,
on
the
record
however,
before
the
nebraska
supreme
court
and
that
court
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
richardson
county
district
court,
made
fact
findings
and
confirmed
the
convention
of
the
district
court
that
the
property
was
in
nebraska.
and
i
might
say
in
that
regard,
that
every
court
that
has
reviewed
the
evidence
has
concluded
that
this
ground
originally
was
in
nebraska,
of
that,
they
all
made
the
determination
that
when
nebraska
was
admitted
to
the
union
on
basis
of
evidence
offered,
the
ground
in
dispute
was
in
nebraska
as
opposed
to
being
in
missouri
and
if
--
of
necessity,
is
in
one
state
or
the
other.
after
the
judgment
was
affirmed
in
the
nebraska
supreme
court
and
she
sought
no
appeal
from
that
judgment
to
this
court.
she
went
back
across
the
river
and
then
the
circuit
court,
i
believe,
they
call
it,
of
the
state
of
missouri
instituted
precisely
the
same
action,
same
parties,
no
dispute
about,
stipulated
and
found
no
(inaudible),
same
real
estate,
no
question
about
it,
stipulate.
they
raise
precisely
the
same
issue,
ownership
of
the
ground
and
the
--
repeated
the
contention
that
it
is
in
missouri.
the
case
was
removed
to
the
federal
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
missouri
and
tried
there
before
judge
duncan
and
the
defense
of
res
judicata
was
asserted
and
the
court
took
evidence
and
by
agreement,
all
of
the
evidence
which
--
went
into
the
nebraska
court
was
received
by
stipulation
of
having
been
previously
prepared
in
the
nebraska
appellate
proceeding.
there
was
some
offer
of
additional
evidence
but,
in
my
opinion
and
consequential,
it
was
matter
to
a
forester
who
testified
that
a
tree
was
cut
on
this
ground
and
in
his
opinion
the
tree
was
of
a
certain
age.
well,
it
doesn't
conflict
with
the
ruling
because
the
nebraska
court
found
that
the
ground
--
the
grounding
question
not
only
was
in
nebraska,
but
it
existed
for
a
fixed
period
of
time,
it
doesn't
conflict
with
it.
and
there
was
--
in
this
ground,
i
might
state,
is
some
one
to
two
miles
west
and
by
west
--
i
mean
--
i
mean
west,
from
where
it
was
at
the
time
nebraska
was
admitted
to
the
union.
that's
just
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
distance
that
the
river
had
to
move
in
order
to
move
with
it
at
the
boundary.
so
that
it
was
our
contention
there
and
the
court,
although
it
did
find
it
necessary
to
determine
on
it,
it
was
our
contention
that
once
that
boundary
line
was
established,
it
was
incumbent
upon
them
if
they
contended
that
the
ground
was
in
missouri
to
establish
that
that
river
moved
from
its
initial
point
at
the
time
nebraska
was
admitted
as
the
result
of
accretion
as
opposed
to
avulsion
because
as
soon
as
you
have
the
first
avulsion,
the
boundary
would
remain
where
it
was
and
the
state
boundary
wouldn't
change
it
but
the
court
concluded
that
the
ground
in
question
was
situated
west
of
a
point
where
the
river
was
established
and
didn't
have
to
determine
the
other
feature
as
to
how
the
river
got
to
where
it
was
since
it
was
already
west
of
that
particular
point,
the
ground
was
in
nebraska
and
consequently,
it
didn't
come
to
any
conclusion
as
to
how
the
river
changed,
that
is
whether
by
accretion
or
avulsion
up
to
a
point
that
is
referred
to
in
the
pleadings
and
in
the
briefs,
as
what
they
call
the
old
shoot.
so,
i
mentioned
that
so
that
there
was
really
no
dispute
as
to
the
fact
that
there's
going
to
lease
at
one
time
was
in
nebraska
and
the
nebraska
court
held
that
it
is
still
in
nebraska.
referring
en
banc
in
--
mr.
august
ross
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
august
ross
midstream
--
mr.
august
ross
--
of
the
missouri
river.
mr.
august
ross
no,
sir.
mr.
august
ross
midstream
is
the
boundary
line
between
the
states
of
nebraska
and
missouri.
the
federal
district
court
granted
the
defense
or
honor
to
recognize
the
defense
of
res
judicata
but
he
proceeded
to
make
what
he
called
fact
findings
that
in
the
event
that
he
was
free
to
conclude
independently
of
the
nebraska
decision
as
to
where
the
ground
was
situated,
he
would
conclude
that
the
ground
was
in
missouri.
and
i
might
mention
that
he
mentions
it
and
he
doesn't
try
to
answer
how
the
ground
ever
got
from
where
it
was
originally
at
the
time
nebraska
was
admitted
to
any
particular
point
by
accretion
or
avulsion.
he
--
and
the
opinion
is
in
the
record,
he
says
assuming
that
the
main
channel
of
the
river
was
west
of
the
ground
in
dispute.
well,
i'll
submit
that
if
we're
going
to
assume
that
one,
we
assume
the
very
crux
of
our
argument
because
if
the
main
channel
of
the
river
was
west
of
where
the
ground
is
in
dispute,
then
the
ground
is
in
missouri.
mr.
august
ross
sure.
mr.
august
ross
i
can't
say
that
--
obviously,
of
course,
we
have
no
authority
to
intervene.
we
tried
the
interest,
the
state
of
missouri
in
the
litigation
and
they
were
not
interested
and
i
assume,
although,
of
course,
i
cannot
speak
that
the
state
of
missouri.
mr.
august
ross
well,
that,
of
course,
would
conclude
the
boundary
line
but
i
don't
think
that
it
would
conclude
the
rights
of
the
parties
particularly.
in
other
words,
their
rights,
as
i
stated
besides
the
tax
deed,
the
--
it
was
also
dependant
upon
other
conveyances
in
the
chain
of
title.
so
that
conceivably,
although
essentially,
the
case
was
tried
on
the
basis
of
whether
it
was
in
missouri
or
nebraska,
the
result
could
still
be
otherwise
even
though
the
court
should
find
that
--
with
boundary
made
them.
mr.
august
ross
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
would
have
any
effect
on.
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
august
ross
i
--
i
think
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
this
court
certainly
has
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
boundary
line
but
in
determining
that
boundary
line,
i
don't
think
that
it
uproots
all
of
the
interest
of
the
parties
in
their
title
along
the
side
of
--
along
the
river
or
if
we
just
have
--
mr.
august
ross
sir,
i
didn't
understand
you.
mr.
august
ross
that
i
--
i'm
sure
is
the
result
of
--
that's
our
position.
mr.
august
ross
yes,
sir.
mr.
august
ross
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor,
i
can't
see
how
it
would
be
otherwise.
mr.
august
ross
it
might,
your
honor,
but
let
me
--
apparently,
i
haven't
made
myself
too
clear.
in
addition
to
the
tax
title,
we
also
have
deeds
of
conveyance
from
the
previous
owners
of
record
of
the
property.
now,
it
is
true
that
they
refer
to
that
property
as
being
situated
in
nebraska
in
those
conveyances,
but
i
think
that
that
dissolved
those
ought
to
be
a
matter
of
identification.
mr.
august
ross
both
of
them,
your
honor,
and
that
they
were
--
mr.
august
ross
--
they
were
--
mr.
august
ross
(voice
overlap)
so
to
speak.
they
were
not
repugnant
to
each
other.
they
--
mr.
august
ross
--
they
were
complementary
deeds,
in
other
words,
deeds
from
everyone
of
record
that
claimed
any
interest
in
the
property
as
well
as
the
--
the
tax
title
which
is
their
procedure
is
equivalent
of
the
mortgage
foreclosure.
actually,
they
instituted
precisely
the
same
ways,
process,
issues,
individuals
served
and
sale
is
at
a
public
sale.
mr.
august
ross
on
the
question
of
possession,
your
honor,
after
the
affirmance
of
the
nebraska
decision,
a
writ
of
assistance
issued
from
the
nebraska
court
and
the
sheriff
of
richardson
county,
nebraska
accompanied
mr.
durfee,
placed
him
in
possession
of
the
property
and
he
moved
a
building
of
some
type
on
their
cabin
and
proceeded
to
remain
there
and
was
prepared
to
remain
there
under
force
severance.
and
rather
than
avoid
any
possible
conflict
and
it
had
all
the
potential
of
possible
conflict,
we
entered
into
a
written
agreement
with
the
parties
on
the
other
side
that
the
property
would
continue
to
be
farmed
during
the
pendency
of
the
litigation,
that
the
proceeds
would
be
placed
in
trust
and
that
they
would
abide
the
results
of
the
litigation
and
then
value
mention
never
intended
to
get
to
it
because
in
the
supplemental
statement
of
facts
which
the
have
filed
in
here,
they
make
the
assertion
that
we
are
not
now
and
never
have
been
in
possession.
and
i
state
that
because
the
record
will
show
from
the
nebraska
courts
that
the
writ
of
assistance
issued,
it
will
show
the
return
of
the
sheriff
that
he
physically
and
actually
accompanied
him
to
the
property,
placed
him
in
possession
of
it
and
then
certainly,
they
have
knowledge
of
our
pending
existence
agreement
with
them
that
the
farming
and
--
will
continue
and
the
proceeds
will
be
deposited
with
member
banks
which
they
have
designated
and
will
abide
themselves
with
its
location.
mr.
august
ross
yes,
sir.
mr.
august
ross
i
dispute
--
is,
your
honor,
he
doesn't
for
instance,
when
it
comes
to
analys
of
the
--
analysis
of
the
evidence,
doesn't
touch
on
the
evidence,
for
instance,
that
was
offered
by
the
defendants
themselves
in
the
district
court
where
they
testify
--
where
their
witnesses
testified
and
there
was
one
gentleman
i
recall
in
particular,
there
was
90
some
years
old
and
he
lived
on
from
this
river
about
all
his
life
and
they
produced
the
witness
testifying
that
he
recalls
steamship,
paddlewheels
coming
up
and
down
what
they
call
the
old
shoot,
they
don't
offer
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
commenting
on
the
evidence,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
claimant
in
the
missouri
action
then
testified
again
in
the
federal
district
court
and
her
testimony
--
was
testimony
when
she
not
offered
in
the
original
act.
in
somewhere
along
the
line,
we've
got
to
stop.
it's
where
we're
going.
mr.
august
ross
i
could
see
it,
your
honor,
that
he
made
that
--
mr.
august
ross
that's
--
that
assertion
is
--
is
bold
and
is
firm
as
--
as
anyone
can
make
it,
that's
true.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
the
regard
too,
the
obviousness,
it
managed
of
bringing
over
and
submitting
to
a
court
a
cold
record
of
a
proceeding
that
was
tried
in
another
state.
its
hard,
really,
to
get
the
full
import
of
the
testimony
when
he
reads
that
and
as
opposed
for
instance,
the
nebraska
court
that
--
that
the
witnesses
came
in,
they
testified,
you
have
the
opportunity
to
observe
their
demeanor.
there
are
--
are
many
factors
involved
there.
and
as
i
say,
as
far
as
the
evidence,
i'm
sure
that
we
can
go
through
the
case
and
you'll
find
that
there
was
a
conflict
of
evidence,
there
is
no
doubt.
then
proceeding,
the
case
then
went
for
review
to
the
eight
circuit
court
of
the
appeals.
in
the
court
there,
in
effect,
said
that
res
judicata
in
full
faith
and
credit
are
not
applicable
that
the
federal
district
court
could
make
a
sense
or
did
make
a
determination
that
it
was
in
nebraska.
it
would
remand
it,
did
remand
that
case
or
ordered
it
remanded
for
the
federal
district
judge
to
go
ahead
and
directed
him
if
he
is
still
has
an
opinion,
i
presume,
to
enter
the
judgment
contrary
to
the
nebraska
supreme
court.
now,
i
submit
fundamentally,
without
first
touching
on
the
authorities
and
they
cited,
i
don't
believe
any
authority
for
the
action.
let's
assume
just
for
the
purposes
of
argument
that
that
this
is
a
proper
determination,
then
where
are
we?
the
court
concludes
that
as
a
matter
of
what
they
call
"certain
policy",
when
you
have
a
land
question
involved
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
determination
of
the
other
court.
so
the
missouri
court
says,
"we
conclude
that
this
ground
is
in
missouri
and
we
don't
have
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
nebraska's
judgment
and
govern
ourselves
accordingly."
well,
if
that
is
true,
then
nebraska,
on
the
other
hand,
has
--
doesn't
have
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
missouri
judgment
because
if
it's
a
matter
of
policy,
nebraska
concludes
that
the
judgment
--
that
the
ground
is
in
nebraska
and
then
can
disregard
the
missouri
judgment.
and
where
--
where
is
the
litigation
to
end?
where
is
it
final?
because
if
res
judicata
is
not
applicable,
then
you're
--
you're
just
be
chasing
yourself
from
one
jurisdiction
to
the
other
and
the
--
there
is
no
limit
on
the
number
of
times
that
you
can
assume
the
same
matter
if
--
if
you
don't
have
any
limitations
on
res
judicata.
mr.
august
ross
your
honor,
they
could
--
mr.
august
ross
--
as
against
--
again,
as
against
the
determination
of
the
boundary
line.
mr.
august
ross
subsequent
private
litigation.
mr.
august
ross
as
to
the
subsequent
private
--
subsequent
private
litigation
but
not
a
litigation
that
have
occurred
before,
yes,
your
honor.
the
only
problem
is
--
mr.
august
ross
obviously
not
and
so
we
are
put
to
our
only
remedy
of
resorting
to
the
court
that
we
did
reserve.
now,
this
court
has
held
in
--
in
a
number
of
decisions
that
jurisdiction
like
other
matters
are
fact
matters
that
when
they're
determined,
when
they're
litigated
that
they
become
binding
and
have
the
same
force
and
effect
as
res
judicata.
there
are
a
number
of
decisions
starting
with
the
hammond
case,
and
this
parallels
the
hammond
case
in
many
respects
and
that
she,
by
she,
the
missouri
claimant,
sought
a
review
in
the
nebraska
supreme
court
of
that
court
of
this
very
question.
now,
she
was
entitled
and
did
receive
a
trial
de
novo
but
she's
not
happy
with
the
result.she
did
not
seek
a
review
of
them
from
that
to
this
court
but
just
went
over
and
found
another
district
court
and
re-file
the
lawsuit.
i
submit
that
the
hammond
case
touches
on
it
very
definitely
and
says
that
--
that
she
voluntarily
contend
to
it.
that
case
also
involved
a
matter
of
an
appellate
review
in
the
state
court
and
the
court
says
there,
all
the
principles
and
res
judicata
including
subject
matter
itself
are
applicable.
she's
bound
by
the
decision
and
it's
final.
mr.
august
ross
how
is
that?
mr.
august
ross
and
the
same
thing
is
true
in
the
hammond
case
of
course.
the
parties
didn't
volunteer
to
commence,
somebody
had
to
institute
the
action.
that
is
true.
but
i
think
that
also
in
--
in
the
--
in
the
subsequent
cases
that
have
been
before
this
court
touching
with
subject
matter,
jurisdiction,
this
court
has
held
that
where
the
matter
of
jurisdiction
of
the
court
was
litigated,
actually
litigated
in
the
forum
which
determines
that
it
has
jurisdiction
and
that
determination
is
permitted
to
become
final,
that
--
then
the
parties
are
bound
by
that
determination.
now,
the
circuit
court
yet
cite,
i
believe
it
was
two
or
three
cases
where
this
court
did
not
apply
the
rules
of
res
judicata
but
i
submit
that
there
are
marked
distinctions
in
the
--
in
those
cases.
there
were
specific
--
one
case
with
a
specific
provisional
act
in
a
bankruptcy
action
wherein
the
bankruptcy
act
specifically
provided
that
no
jurisdiction
in
banks,
the
court
existed
over
an
insurance
company.
and
i
believe
there
was
determination
of
adjudicating
a
bank
so
--
in
an
insurance
company
and
i
also
submit
in
that
case,
there
was
not
an
active
adjudication
of
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
it
was
the
--
mr.
august
ross
your
honor,
i'm
not
so
sure
the
she
did
have
one
but
she
was
--
mr.
august
ross
that
might
very
well
have
been.
that
often
is
the
case,
i'm
sure.
mr.
august
ross
yes,
your
honor,
but
with
this
qualification,
when
that
lawsuit
was
instituted,
she,
at
that
time,
had
the
option
to
say,
"i
will
not
litigate
the
question
in
this
court
and
then
she
would
not
have
been
precluded
from
litigating
the
question
in
missouri
but
once
having
commended
that
court
to
litigate
--
mr.
august
ross
that's
quite
title
action
but
i
don't
think
she
would
have
been
concluded
in
the
state
of
missouri.
then
you
still
have
the
question
as
would
have
had
the
question
open,
i
think,
as
to
where
the
ground
was
situated.
i
believe
in
the
case
of
riley
versus
new
york
trust,
it
dealt
with
a
--
an
in
rem
action
but
it
dealt
with
an
action
for
the
probate
of
an
estate.
and
in
that
case,
the
husband
came
in
and
--
it's
a
rem
proceeding
and
contested
in
the
state
of
georgia,
the
question
of
the
domicile
of
his
wife
contending
that
it
was
new
york
and
that
the
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
in
georgia
that
decided
against
him.
then
an
administrator
was
appointed
in
new
york
and
this
court
stated
in
its
opinion
that
as
far
as
the
husband
is
concerned,
he
win
in
the
state
of
georgia.
he
litigated
that
question
and
he
is
bound.
he,
however,
did
determine
that
there
was
not
the
privity
relationship
between
the
husband
and
the
administrator
and
therefore,
the
administrator
was
still
free
to
--
mr.
august
ross
i
think
that
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
that's
the
effect
of
nebraska
judgment
assuming,
of
course,
that
(inaudible)
got
--
mr.
august
ross
if
she
is
contented
that
it
was
in
another
jurisdiction,
i
think
that
is
correct
or
she
could
have
removed
the
action
in
a
federal
court,
if
she
didn't
want
the
nebraska
state
court
to
--
to
litigate
it.
mr.
august
ross
well,
we
have
diversity.
mr.
august
ross
say
the
diversity
existed
and
the
value
existed,
i
think
that
it
would
have
been
an
action.
mr.
august
ross
yes,
your
honor.
she
is
a
resident
of
missouri.
our
client
is
resident
of
nebraska.
but
i
don't
think
that
she
can
come
in,
litigate
at
nebraska,
take
her
chances
there
and
say,
"well,
i
don't
like
it
there,
so
i'm
going
to
go
try
it
somewhere
else."
mr.
august
ross
they
were
also
residents
of
missouri.
mr.
august
ross
well,
first,
in
--
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
residents.
they
actually
lived
and
resided
in
--
mr.
august
ross
resided
in
missouri?
no,
they
lived,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
lived
--
mr.
august
ross
--
even
further
in
off
of
--
this
was
unoccupied
--
by
--
unoccupied
and
no
structures
on
it.
so
i
don't
--
mr.
august
ross
it
was
--
no
structure,
so
i'm
sure
that
questions
were
not
have
been
involved.
i
will
seek
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal
if
it's
alright.
mr.
august
ross
first
place,
i
like
to
point
out
that
patents
had
been
issued
by
the
united
states
government
in
the
state
of
nebraska
to
people
of
nebraska
on
this
ground
so
that
the
title
did
emanate
from
the
united
states
of
america.
a
chain
of
title
did
commence
on
this
very
ground
from
the
united
states
to
residents
of
nebraska.
secondly,
we're
in
accord
that,
of
course,
this
determination
has
no
binding
effect
on
the
states
itself
as
to
the
boundary.
with
reference
to
the
case
that
he
cited
at
(inaudible)
versus
171
acres,
the
court
will
find
on
review
this
situation,
the
suit
required
title
was
filed
in
the
state
of
iowa.
i've
been
attempted
to
find
out
but
can't
determine
but
i'm
advised
that
they
did
not
litigate
in
that
court
any
jurisdictional
question.
subsequent
to
the
entry
of
the
judgment
in
iowa,
they
then
brought
the
judgment
to
nebraska
for
recording
under
a
special
statutory
proceeding
for
the
recording
of
foreign
judgments.
at
that
time,
that
court
litigated
the
jurisdictional
question
and
concluded
that
jurisdiction
was
wanting
in
iowa
because
the
ground
was
in
nebraska.
that
is
as
far
as
the
opinion
will
go
because
in
completing
their
appellate
process,
they
fumbled
the
ball,
they
didn't
get
a
review
and
so
the
judgments
stood
firm.
in
other
words,
they
neglected
to
get
the
bill
of
exceptions
--
mr.
august
ross
--
before
the
appellate
court
and
of
course,
as
the
matter
then
comes
for
--
to
us
for
review
on
the
pleadings
and
on
the
pleading,
we
can
do
nothing
else
but
affirm
down
below.
so
actually,
there
is
no
contrary
decision
there
and
there
is
no
denial
of
the
very
position
which
we
take
here.
now
--
mr.
august
ross
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
august
ross
they
are
identical
but
i
say
--
mr.
august
ross
factually
identical
but
all
of
which
to
point
out
again
that
besides
the
tax
title
which
i
made
it
from
the
state,
there
was
this
other
chain
of
title
as
well,
your
honor
and
that
the
title
had
initially
left
the
united
states
government
and
then
transferred
to
private
individuals.
mr.
august
ross
first,
if
i
may
address
myself
to
justice
goldberg
in
an
answer
to
the
question
he
asked
me
about
what
could
be
the
party
have
done
on
--
on
the
affirmance
of
the
judgment
from
the
nebraska
supreme
court
and
i
responded
earlier
that
perhaps
there
was
not
a
federal
question.
well,
frankly,
it
was
not
my
problem.
i
can't
say
that
--
that
there
is
or
none
but
it
appears
to
me
on
reflection
also
that
if
we
have
a
situation
where
a
nebraska
court
was
taking
missouri
grounds,
you
might
very
well
had
a
federal
question
of
taking
property
without
due
process.
but
as
i
said
that
i'm
outing
up
the
question.
referring
to
the
actual
crux
of
this
thing
and
particularly
to
the
opinion
filed
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
here
and
then
the
court
relies
as
has
been
earlier
pointed
out
on
the
restatement
for
its
authority
and
there
are
five
criteria
that
are
set
out
under
restatement.
the
first
of
them
being
that
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
was
clear.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
in
coming
to
that
particular
criteria,
the
eighth
circuit
court
itself
says
that
nebraska's
lack
of
jurisdiction
is
not
particularly
clear.
in
other
words,
here,
they
are
and
they
go
on
with
the
rest
of
the
item.
determination
of
jurisdiction
dependent
on
a
question
of
law
rather
than
fact,
that's
the
second
criterion
and
the
court
says,
"no,
that's
not
applicable."
they
come
to
the
next
criterion
and
say
the
court
was
one
of
limited,
not
general
jurisdiction,
they
say,
"no,
that's
not
applicable."
but
the
question
was
not
actually
litigated
and
the
court
says,
"no,
that
that
is
not
applicable."
so
we
actually
have
a
situation
then
they
come
to
the
last
one
that
says
that
the
policy
against
the
courts
acting
beyond
it's
jurisdiction
is
strong,
that's
the
only
remaining
criteria
and
then
they
relate
that
one
back
to
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
but
they
had
already
determined
that
the
court's
lack
of
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
is
not
particularly
clear.
so
i
submit
that
aside
from
the
fact
that
if
this
is
a
proper
determination
of
the
law,
there
is
no
form
in
which
we
can
get
a
final
answer.
that
actually,
its
reasoning
in
--
is
inconsistent.
inconsistent
in
that
they
state
that
the
policy
which
is
involved
is
at
one
state
should
not
rule
upon
the
jurisdiction
of
land
in
another
state
and
then
the
same
breadth,
they
said
that
the
lack
of
--
of
nebraska's
jurisdiction
was
not
clear
and
that
was
the
very
issue
which
nebraska
had
to
decide
in
determining
whether
it
had
jurisdiction.
one
or
two
other
items
that
were
mentioned
and
--
i
don't
think
they
go
to
the
merits
of
it
but
that
there
was
other
ground
involved
when
this
action
was
originally
filed.
the
only
answer
in
saying
that,
that
when
original
lawsuit
was
filed,
in
addition
to
describing
the
grounds
to
which
we
had
actual
deeds,
there
was
a
thought
that
there
might
be
other
accretion
land
involved
and
the
description
was
enlarged
on.
the
lower
court
held
that
we
did
not
prevail
as
to
the
other,
no
cross-appeal
was
taken
and
no
question
really
involved
there.
i
don't
think
that
it
ever
should
get
to
the
point
that
all
of
us
lawyers
make
mistakes
and
i'm
afraid
our
clients
have
to
suffer
with
them
but
it
--
it
was
an
unfortunate
choice
as
to
her
counsel
in
agreeing
to
come
in
to
a
nebraska
court
and
litigate
it.
nevertheless,
that's
the
honor
of
the
dilemma
that
she
chose
and
i
submit
respectfully
under
the
law
of
res
judicata
that
that
decision
should
be
by
mean.
mr.
august
ross
they
--
he
--
somewhat
the
same
way,
your
honor,
that
we
had
--
mr.
august
ross
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
august
ross
we
chose
to
go
in
on
the
basis
that
we
already
had
the
commission
which
we
felt
was
under
the
federal
constitution
entitled
to
the
joint
intermeddling
operation
of
res
judicata
in
full
faith
and
credit,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
august
ross
that
was
part
of
the
title,
your
honor,
but
that
was
not
the
sole
basis
upon
the
claim
and
ownership
to
the
property
involved.
mr.
august
ross
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
august
ross
no,
i
didn't
say
that,
your
honor,
i
was
unable
to
conclude
that
from
the
reading
of
the
decisions.
what
i
stated
is
just
actually
the
basic
distinction,
i
believe
it
is
that
even
though
where
--
the
second
decision
having
become
final,
the
last
decision
having
become
final,
that,
in
fact,
is
the
decision
which
becomes
res
judicata.
i
believe
that's
the
reason
in
that
case
ultimately,
but
--
mr.
august
ross
your
honor,
as
i
state,
i'm
unable
to
determine
from
the
reports
in
the
first
place,
whether
they
ever
appeared
in
iowa.
whether
--
whether
jurisdiction
was
ever
litigated
in
iowa,
on
my
reading
of
it,
i
can't
ascertain
whether
they
did.
and
as
i
stated,
it
didn't
come
up
until
they
brought
the
action
in
nebraska
to
record
the
judgment
and
at
the
time,
the
court
made
inquiry
as
to
the
matter
of
jurisdiction.
but
i
believe
the
answer
is
that
is
the
last
judgment,
right
or
wrong,
which
becomes
res
judicata.
let's
assume
that
we
have
permitted
this
--
the
circuit
court's
finding
in
this
case
to
become
final,
then
i
think
we
have
no
argument
any
longer
to
go
back
and
--
and
secure
an
older
judgment
and
say
that
this
one
is
res
judicata
that
the
same
thing
was
true
in
the
treinies
case,
i
believe,
if
i
pronounced
that
correctly.
where
there
were
inconsistent
judgments
and
the
court
says
in
that
position,
is
the
last
determination
as
well.
