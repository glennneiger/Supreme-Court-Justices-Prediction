would
that
regard
for

in
the

white
(inaudible)
pertinent
to
the
soundness
of
the
statement
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
questionably,
there'd
liability
over
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
were
you
--
i
think
that
you're
really
asking
for
--
for
a
rule
generally
relating
to
--
or
at
least
it's
in
the
area
of
the
general
liability
in
--
in
the
contract
process
of
the
formal
services
with
equipment.
what
do
you
think
the
state
of
the
law
is
around
the
country
if
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
independent
contractors
when
they
--
they
come
to
your
house
to
repair
--
have
a
vision
or
--
or
all
sorts
of
the
--
merely
the
situation.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
the
law
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
of
any
cases
that
hold
a
--
any
cases
that
hold
an
independent
contract
of
libel
for
a
non
--
where
there's
no
negligence
involved
or
an
accident
caused
by
defective
equipment?
do
you
know
of
any
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
(inaudible)
supplier?
he
has
to
sell
anyone
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
he
uses
it
in
connection
with
the
purpose
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
of
the
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
had,
you
probably
would've
assigned
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
find
any
--
did
you
find
any
in
the
--
in
each
one
of
those
briefs
along
the
side?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
suppose,
would
argue
the
same
way
if
the
damage
is
done
by
the
equipment
was
to
the
ship
and
there
was
no
injured
longshoreman
involved?
justice
byron
r.
white
you'll
have
to
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
although
the
pressure,
the
fairness
part
isn't
here
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
you
--
wouldn't
you
almost
have
to
say
the
shipowner
could
recover
for
damage
to
the
ship
of
defective
equipment
of
the
longshoreman
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
or
the
stevedore?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
indemnity
(inaudible)
it
was
an
indemnity
of
--
of
operation
of
--
but
supposed
the
ship
has
to
be
liable
with
somebody
else
before
the
stevedore
is
liable?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
what,
it
really
--
well,
you
wouldn't
be
making
this
argument
or
would
you
if
it
was
just
an
injury
to
the
ship?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
that
--
that
there
ought
to
be
indemnity
here
or
there
ought
to
be
a
liability
of
the
stevedore
for
--
on
a
contractual
warranty?

is
it
