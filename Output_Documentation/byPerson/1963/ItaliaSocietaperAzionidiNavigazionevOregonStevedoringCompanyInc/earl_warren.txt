mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
was
this
a
new
or
an
old
rope
mr.
--
is
there
any
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
government
is
here
just
as
another
shipowner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
the
parties
as
the
question
of
contract
interpretation
is
not
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understand
(inaudible)
what
and
why
if
a
shipowner
did
feel
that
way,
why
he
wouldn't
make
it
more
clearer
in
this
contract
that
he
wrote
than
--
than
he
did
here
because
here,
he
--
well,
while
you
say
this
isn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
an
issue
here,
still
he
didn't
say
and
any
such
thing,
did
he,
in
--
in
language?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
may
have
contracted
in
a
way
by
this
language.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
that
question
isn't
here
but
you
were
telling
me
how
you
would
feel
if
you're
a
shipowner
and
i
thought
that
i
would
feel
the
same
way.
but
if
i
did
then
i
was
linking
a
division
of
responsibility
because
of
negligence
and
so
forth
in
equipment.
i
think
i
would
express
it
to
the
contract.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
you
said
that's
what
you
would
do.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
