mr.
erskine
b.
wood
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
my
name
is
erskine
b.
wood,
from
portland,
oregon.
i
represent
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
i
have
as
much
--
i
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
pronouncing
its
name.
i
usually
called
it
the
italian
line
for
short.
this
is
a
case
in
the
maritime
field
involving
the
question
of
rights
of
indemnity.
these
are
the
ship
operators
and
their
contracting
stevedores.
the
--
specifically,
it
involves
those
rights
with
respect
to
defective
equipment
brought
aboard
a
vessel
by
the
contracting
stevedore.
now,
your
honors
recall
that
this
matter
of
the
shipowners
or
operators
recovering
indemnity
over
against
their
contracting
stevedores
has
been
the
subject
of
quite
a
line
of
decisions
in
this
case
--
in
this
court
starting
with
the
case
of
ryan
stevedore
company
against
pan-atlantic.
and
that
was
followed
by
weyerhaeuser
versus
nacirema
and
crumady
against
the
s.s.
joachim
fisser
and
waterman
against
dugan
&
mcnamara.
all
of
those
are
decisions
by
this
court
within
the
last
few
years
dealing
with
this
general
topic
of
indemnity.
and
in
those
cases,
the
court
has
spelled
out
the
doctrine
of
indemnification
as
being
one
that
is
based
on
contract,
based
on
the
theory
that
the
contracting
stevedore,
when
it
undertakes
by
contract
to
do
the
stevedoring
work
onboard,
the
vessel,
impliedly
warrants
that
it
will
do
the
work
in
a
workmanlike
manner
and
will
not
render
a
substandard
service.
and
the
court
has
said
that
that
is
an
implied
--
a
warranty
implied
in
fact
and
it
is
comparable
to
a
manufacturer's
warranty
of
the
soundness
of
its
product
and
that
competency
in
safety
of
stowage
are
at
the
very
essence
of
the
service
undertaken.
now,
that's
the
--
just
the
general
background
of
the
field
that
we
are
in.
now,
the
cases
that
have
been
expressly
decided
by
this
court
on
indemnity,
have
involved
acts
of
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
stevedore,
that
is
human
error
committed
by
the
stevedore's
employees
rather
than
the
furnishing
of
defective
equipment.
the
case
at
bar,
however,
involves
a
case
where
the
stevedore
company
in
pursuance
of
its
stevedoring
work
on
the
ship,
brought
aboard
and
used
in
connection
with
its
work
a
--
a
piece
of
rope
that
was
unfit
and
defective.
now,
the
facts
--
the
specific
facts
of
this
particular
case
are
very
simple.
the
stevedore
company
was
doing
work
on
the
petitioner's
vessel
on
portland,
oregon
and
it
was
doing
this
work
under
a
contract
which
provided
that
the
stevedore
would
furnish
all
ordinary
gear
required
in
the
work
and
all
labors
and
supervision
and
so
forth.
and
as
a
part
of
the
work
and
as
a
part
of
that
contract,
they
furnished
an
ordinary
canvass
rain
tent,
that
is
simply
a
tent
to
protect
the
cargo
from
getting
wet
from
rain.
now,
attached
to
this
tent
are
what
they
call
tie-down
ropes.
they're
simply
a
--
a
short
length
of
rope,
that
is
big
around
as
a
person's
thumb
to
tie
the
end
of
the
tent
down,
keep
it
from
ripping
around.
and
one
of
these
ropes
was
defective
and
as
a
result,
one
of
the
longshoremen,
who
is
the
employee
of
the
stevedore
contractor
in
pulling
on
this
rope,
it
broke
and
he
fell
to
the
deck
and
sustained
injury.
the
longshoreman
sued
the
shipowner,
the
petitioner
here,
in
the
state
court
and
recovered
a
verdict.
the
shipowner
then
sued
originally
in
admiralty
in
the
district
court
to
recover
indemnification
over
and
against
the
stevedore
who
had
brought
the
tent
aboard
and
furnished
the
(inaudible)
did
not
specify.
however,
there
was
no
evidence
in
any
way
to
connect
and
to
charge
any
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner
because
they
had
no
control
over
this
rope.
the
rope
was
supplied
by
the
stevedore
contractor,
brought
aboard
and
it
remains
continually
in
the
stevedore's
(inaudible)
presented
but
it
was
a
general
verdict
and
in
the
complaint
--
and
i
think
--
i
think
your
honor
it's
actually
submitted
on
a
basis
to
the
jury,
in
that
case,
on
the
basis
of
both
unseaworthiness
and
negligence.
so
you
can't
tell
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well,
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i'm
--
i'm
jumping
--
i'm
jumping
a
little
bit
to
the
findings
of
the
district
court
in
this
particular
case
which
would
dispel
any
possibility
of
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
steamship
company
because
the
court
in
this
case
has
found
that
the
sole
cause
of
the
accident
was
a
latent
defect
and
that
this
had
been
furnished
by
the
stevedore
and
was
exclusively
in
their
control,
and
so
those
are
the
facts
in
the
record
before
us
and
i
think
those
facts,
the
findings
of
the
trial
judge
dispel
any
possibility
of
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
shipowner.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
the
rope
itself
was
an
evidence
in
the
court.
it
was
not
a
new
rope.
it
was
a
--
a
rope
which
had
been
in
used
for
some
time
but
there
was
testimony
on
the
part
of
the
stevedore
that
they
had
inspected
it
before
it
was
brought
aboard
and
that
it
appeared
to
be
alright.
and
based
on
the
evidence
in
the
case,
the
district
judge
found
that
they
had
overcome
inferences
and
negligence,
and
he
found
specifically
that
the
stevedore
contractor
had
not
been
negligent
that
this
was
a
--
a
latent
defective
--
latently
defective
rope
that
they
had
furnished.
now,
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
yes,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
neither
party
was
negligence.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
that's
exactly
and
precisely
the
question,
that's
precisely
the
question
on
the
case.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
if
that
would
be
irrelevant
in
this
case
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
yes,
we
are
concerned
here
precisely
with
the
narrow
question
of
whether
the
contracting
stevedore
owes
an
absolute
warranty
regardless
of
negligence
that
when
it
brings
equipment
aboard
a
vessel
for
use
in
its
own
operations,
that
it
warrants
the
reasonable
fitness
of
that
equipment.
now,
the
--
we
contend
of
course
that
such
a
warranty
exist
in
flowing
from
it,
a
right
of
indemnification
exists.
it's
first
important
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well
of
course
it's
--
it's
not
in
the
record
but
as
everybody
knows,
both
parties
are
insured.stevedores
insure
their
liability
and
vessels
insure
their
liability.
there's
no
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
so
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
that
is
right.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
that
is
--
that
is
behind
--
i
--
i
will
say
this
though
that
the
--
the
united
states
government
has
filed
a
brief
amicus
in
this
case
and
because
they
are
among
the
largest
shipowners
in
the
world
and
their
brief
supports
our
position
and
so
far
as
i'm
aware,
the
government
is
not
insured.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
and
this
of
course
is
a
broad
question
affecting
all
stevedores
and
all
shipowners
and
operators.
so
insofar
as
the
government's
interest
are
concerned,
they're
self-insured
or
--
now,
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
the
government
is
here
as
another
shipowner
and
they
have
stated
their
position
in
their
brief
amicus.
there's
also
a
brief
amicus
on
file
in
this
case
by
associations
of
private
ship
operators.
now,
in
approaching
this
question,
i
want
to
first
call
attention
to
the
legal
background
because
when
we
consider
questions
whether
an
implied
warranty
exists,
we
have
to
view
that
in
relation
to
all
the
facts,
the
circumstances
and
the
--
the
background
of
the
law,
the
general
background
of
the
law.
(inaudible)
brought
aboard
the
ships
by
the
stevedore
contractor.
in
other
words,
even
as
to
equipment
which
--
over
which
the
shipowner
has
no
control
and
which
it's
brought
aboard
by
the
stevedore
contractor,
yet
for
humanitarian
reasons,
the
shipowner
is
held
to
the
absolute
warranty
to
the
injured
workman
of
the
fitness
of
that
equipment.
now
--
so
therefore,
you
can
see
that
what
occurs
in
this
case
is
that
when
the
stevedore
contractor
brings
equipment
aboard
in
the
course
of
its
work
which
is
defective
and
unfit
for
the
purpose
for
which
it's
to
be
used
and
that
breaks
and
causes
injury
to
one
of
the
stevedore's
own
employees.
the
stevedore
in
effect
is
visited
or
imposed
the
liability
on
the
ship.
it
sort
of
a
vicarious
liability.
the
ship
is
held
liable
for
this
equipment
that
the
stevedore
has
been
brought
--
has
brought
aboard.
now,
their
--
this
precise
question
has
not
been
decided
but
of
course
by
this
court,
although
as
i
will
say
in
a
few
moments,
i
think
there're
very
strong
indications
from
a
number
of
recent
decisions
as
to
what
--
that
the
result
would
be
in
accordance
to
what
we
urge.
in
these
circuits,
there
are
only
two
cases.
the
--
the
second
circuit
in
the
case
of
booth
against
meier
&
oelhaf
decided
this
precise
issue
in
accordance
with
what
we
urge.
i
don't
need
to
go
into
the
facts
of
the
case
other
than
to
say
that
a
contractor
brought
aboard
a
ship,
a
wire
strap.
but
--
there
was
no
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
contractor
but
it
was
lately
defective.
it
broke,
one
of
the
contractor's
workman
was
injured,
recovered
against
the
vessel
owner
upon
the
--
its
absolute
warranty
of
fitness
of
the
gear
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
shipowner
was
entitled
to
full
indemnity
against
the
stevedore
contractor
based
upon
the
theory
of
an
implied
warranty
of
the
fitness
of
the
equipment.
and
actually
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think
wrote
a
very
strong
and
well
recent
opinion
which
i
can
almost
submit
in
--
in
lieu
of
my
whole
argument
here
because
the
--
the
issues
are
squarely
raised
in
that
opinion,
that's
a
very
well
recent
opinion
in
our
judgment.
now,
the
--
in
the
present
case,
the
ninth
circuit
decided
the
case
against
the
implied
warranty
by
two-to-one.
the
majority
justices
barnes
and
hamlin
felt
that
they
did
not
want
to
extend
the
stevedore
contractor's
liability
beyond
ordinary
negligence.
they
reached
that
result,
we
think
or
a
rather
strained
and
narrow
construction
of
this
court's
opinion
in
ryan
in
the
other
cases.
they
mentioned
that
this
court
has
frequently
referred
to
the
warranty
of
workmanlike
service
as
being
the
warranty
owed
by
the
contracting
stevedore.
and
they
said
from
that
that
they
looked
up
dictionary
definitions
of
the
word
"workmanlike"
and
they
went
into
a
question
of
semantics
and
the
acquainted
workmanlike
with
skillful
adopt
and
things
of
that
nature
and
therefore,
they
seem
to
think
that
the
only
warranty
was
one
against
negligence.
justice
jertberg
dissented,
he
would
follow
the
booth
case
in
the
second
circuit
saying
that
--
it
--
it
was
only
fair
as
between
these
two
parties
that
since
that
it
was
the
stevedore
that
brought
the
equipment
aboard
and
subjected
the
vessel
owner
to
liability
that
the
stevedore
should
bear
the
ultimate
loss.
he
also
comments
on
the
placing
the
risk,
ultimate
risk
on
the
party
best
able
to
avoid
it.
now,
in
my
argument,
i
wish
to
make
essentially
three
points.
the
first
point
really
is
that,
although
this
court
has
not
exactly
decided
this
precise
question,
the
--
the
result
for
which
--
which
we
urge
has
been
foreshadowed
by
numerous
statements
in
the
opinions
of
the
court.
secondly,
that
just
as
a
simple
matter
of
fairness,
the
stevedore
should
owe
this
warranty.
and
thirdly,
as
a
matter
of
policy
to
prevent
injuries
or
minimize
injuries,
the
ultimate
risk
ought
to
be
placed
on
the
stevedore
contractor.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
yes.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
that
is
what
i
answered
to
mr.
justice
goldberg.
there
is
a
case
of
contract
--
a
question
--
excuse
me
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
a
contract
interpretation
under
the
specific
contract.
however,
that
isn't
reached
in
this
case,
in
the
case
at
bar
because
the
court
of
appeals
for
ninth
circuit,
the
majority
opinion
did
not
pass
on
that
but
simply
said
broadly
that
regardless
of
contract
or
in
any
event,
there
is
no
implied
warranty.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
think
--
i
think
so
and
i
want
to
confess
that
i
think
i
asked
for
a
little
too
much
relief
when
i
urged
that
it
should
simply
be
reversed
with
relief
given
to
us,
i
think
that
the
--
they
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
pass
on
that
contract
interpretation
point.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
yes,
that
--
that's
it.
in
other
words,
if
we
assume
there
is
an
implied
warranty
which
we
urged
and
which
has
been
held
by
the
second
circuit
then
it
would
have
to
be
decided
whether
any
expressed
clauses
in
their
contract
excluded
such
an
implied
warranty.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
yes,
that
--
that's
been
agreed
in
the
brief
on
both
sides
so
that
question
is
not
before
this
court.
now,
first
of
all,
i
want
to
discuss
briefly
the
--
my
point
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
indicated
or
foreshadowed
the
result
from
which
we
--
which
we
urged.
in
ryan
and
all
of
the
cases
subsequent
to
that,
it
has
been
repeatedly
stated
that
the
stevedore's
warranty
is
based
in
contract
and
it's
not
in
any
way
based
on
the
tort
and
that
theories
of
active
and
passive
negligence
and
things
of
that
sort
have
no
application
in
this
field
of
warranty.
secondly,
this
court
has
said
that
the
warranty
owed
by
the
stevedore
is
--
and
i
quote
"comparable."
i
--
i
may
not
exactly
quote,
but
it's
comparable
to
the
warranty
owed
by
a
manufacturer
of
products
as
to
the
soundness
of
its
products.
and
the
court
--
the
court's
noticed
it
and
--
and
as
it
intended
to
say
that
warranty
of
a
manufacturer
as
to
the
soundness
of
its
product
is
an
absolutely
warranty.
it
is
no
defense
to
the
manufacturer
to
say
that
it
was
not
negligent.
the
warrant
is
absolute.
in
fact,
even
under
the
--
not
only
manufacturers
but
sellers
under
the
uniform
sales
act
where
they
sell
an
article
to
a
buyer
and
the
buyer
is
relying
upon
the
judgment
and
experience
of
the
seller,
they
sell
him
a
proper
article,
and
the
seller
knows
the
purpose
for
which
the
article
is
going
to
be
used
by
the
seller,
owes
an
absolute
warranty
of
--
that
is
reasonably
fit,
reasonably
suitable
for
the
purpose
intended.
now
--
and
it's
a
--
it's
kind
of
a
funny
thing.
i
think
to
some
extent,
this
court
adopted
the
rule
in
ryan
perhaps
by
assuming
the
very
proposition
that
we
urge
here.
the
government's
brief
--
amicus
brief
in
ryan
referred
to
this
various
cases
of
warranties
by
the
manufacturer,
warranties
by
sellers
and
the
warranty
by
a
supplier.
and
i
think
from
--
from
that
warranty
which
was
pretty
well
accepted,
was
urging
this
court
to
adopt
the
principle
that
the
stevedore
also
owed
a
warranty
as
to
its
services
and
there's
a
passage
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
the
ryan
case
which
says
--
says
this,
"a
light
result
occurs
where
a
shipowner
sues
for
breach
of
warranty
a
supplier
of
defective
ship's
gear
that
has
caused
injury
or
death
to
a
longshoreman
using
it
in
the
course
of
his
employment
on
shipboard."
now,
that
of
course
is
exactly
the
present
case
where
we
had
--
we
have
now
a
shipowner
suing
the
contracting
stevedore
who
supplied
defective
gear.
so
perhaps
in
ryan,
the
court
was
relying
upon
--
generally
assuming
the
result
for
which
we
urge
and
then
expanding
that
into
the
--
the
service
warranty.
now,
more
important
though
than
these
indications
because
i
realized
that
it's
hard
to
take
single
sentences
and
quotations
out
of
context,
that
is
the
case
of
reed
against
yaka.
now,
reed
against
yaka
was
decided
by
this
court
only
last
term.
the
decision
was
in
may.
and
you
recall
that
--
that
case
didn't
involve
the
precise
issue
here
but
the
reasoning
by
which
the
majority
of
the
court
reached
its
result,
assumed
the
correctness
of
the
proposition
which
we
are
now
urging.
now,
i'll
explain
that.
in
reed
against
yaka,
the
longshoreman
had
been
injured
by
his
foot
going
through
a
wooden
pallet
board
that
was
defective.
that
had
been
furnished
and
brought
aboard
as
in
the
present
case
by
the
stevedore
company
who
is
the
employer
of
reed.
now,
the
--
the
unusual
thing
and
--
and
the
thing
that
presented
the
problem
to
this
court
in
reed
against
yaka
was
that
the
stevedore
employer
of
the
man
and
the
ship
operator
where
one
and
the
same.
the
pan-atlantic
steamship
company
had
chartered
this
ship,
was
operating
it
as
a
bareboat
charter
in
this
--
in
the
position
of
an
owner.
but
they
also
had
a
stevedoring
department
and
so
this
man
was
their
own
employee
and
the
question
was
really
--
was
a
procedural
one.
the
question
is
whether
the
injured
longshoreman
could
maintain
a
libel
in
rem
against
the
vessel
without
a
corresponding
or
supporting
in
personam
liability.
and
so
the
court
examined
the
question
whether
there
would
be
a
separate
in
personam
liability
on
the
part
of
this
company
that
in
effect
was
wearing
two
hats.
it
was
operating
the
ship
but
also
had
a
stevedoring
department
and
employed
the
man.
and
of
course
the
big
question
was
whether
in
that
situation,
the
injured
man
could
sue
a
party
who
albeit,
it
was
operating
the
ship
was
at
the
same
time
a
stevedored
company
and
his
employer.
and
we
have
the
longshoreman
and
harbored
workers'
compensation
act
that
said
that
that
liability
under
the
act
for
compensation
was
exclusive
and
it
was
on
that
ground
that
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
stewart
dissented
because
of
the
provisions
for
longshoreman
and
harbored
act.
but
now,
in
reaching
the
result
in
reed
against
yaka,
the
majority
said
--
they
--
they
assumed
that
the
correctness
of
the
proposition
that
we
are
now
urging.
in
reed
against
yaka,
it
was
a
latent
defect
and
the
findings
of
the
district
court
specifically
and
expressly
said
that
the
sole
cause
of
injury
was
latent
defect.
there
was
no
negligence
on
anybody's
part.
that's
in
the
district
court's
findings
and
it's
repeated
in
this
court's
finding.
then
this
court
said,
well,
if
the
--
there
had
been
a
--
a
separate
shipowner
and
an
independent
contractor
stevedore,
why
there
is
no
doubt
at
all
that
the
man
could
have
recovered
against
the
shipowner
for
the
defective
equipment
onboard
the
vessel
and
the
ship
operator
in
turn
under
ryan,
could
then
have
placed
the
ultimate
loss
upon
the
stevedore
contractor.
the
--
the
court's
precise
words
on
that
are
as
follow,
"thus,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
if
the
petitioner
here
had
been
employed
to
do
this
particular
work
by
an
independent
stevedoring
company
rather
than
directly
by
the
owner,
he
could
have
recovered
damages
for
his
injury
from
the
owner
who
could
have
then
under
ryan
shift
to
the
burden
of
recovery
to
petitioner's
stevedoring
employer."
and
a
little
bit
later,
the
court
said,
"in
either
case
under
ryan,
the
burden
ultimately
falls
on
the
company
who's
the
fault
cause
the
injury.
so
there
--
really,
i
think
the
court
assumed
the
correctness
of
the
proposition
we
urged
and
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
there
was
a
--
this
is
mentioned
by
--
in
my
opponent's
brief
and
i'm
glad
your
honor
asked
this
question.
the
--
it
was
a
latent
defect
just
as
we
have
here
and
i
think
the
court,
when
it
states
that
the
ship
operator
if
it
had
been
held
liable,
could
then
under
ryan,
have
recovered
indemnity
over
against
the
stevedore
contractor
if
he
had
been
an
independent
contractor,
was
stating
the
broad
rule
of
recovery
under
implied
work.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
yes,
because
it
says
under
ryan.
now,
there
was
--
actually
in
that
case,
there
was
an
indemnity
agreement,
a
contractual
indemnity
agreement
and
that's
pointed
out
in
my
opponent's
brief.
but
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
--
an
expressed
indemnity
agreement
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
no,
an
expressed
contractual
in
--
in
reed
against
yaka,
but
it
had
no
significance
to
this
problem
that
the
court
mentioned
because
of
this.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well,
that
--
that
--
that's
the
thing
i
want
to
explain.
in
reed
against
yaka,
the
owner
of
the
ship
was
the
waterman
steamship
company.
they
had
--
they're
both
chartered
to
pan-atlantic
as
a
ship
operator.
pan-atlantic
had
a
stevedore
department
and
employed
the
injured
man.
now,
this
indemnity
clause
was
in
the
contract
in
the
charter
party,
it
wasn't
in
the
stevedoring
contract.
it
was
in
a
charter
party
between
a
shipowner
chartering
his
ship
out
to
pan-atlantic.
in
other
words,
it
was
a
clause
that
regardless
of
where
their
ship
might
go
or
regardless
whether
independent
contractors
or
others
were
doing
it,
the
--
the
owner
was
going
to
be
reimbursed
by
the
bareboat
charter
refer
and
protected
against
anything.
but
that
is
--
that's
in
a
charter
party,
a
lease
of
the
vessel
if
it
wasn't
any
indemnity
agreement
in
a
stevedore
contract.
and
the
court
here
was
--
i'm
sure
was
not
deciding
reed
against
yaka
on
the
very
narrow
principle
that
there
was
an
indemnity
agreement.
now,
the
supreme
court,
this
court
said
in
reed
against
yaka
that
the
economic
effect
was
really
the
same
when
you
threw
the
ultimate
loss
here
on
the
party
who
is
the
man's
employer
because
that
was
no
different
than
the
situation
where
an
independent
contracting
stevedore
would
be
the
employer,
would
suffer
the
ultimate
loss.
and
the
court
uses
the
words
"who
could
then,
under
ryan,
have
recovered."
now,
under
ryan,
the
court
didn't
--
did
not
say
under
the
indemnity
clause
and
the
charter
party,
it
said
under
ryan
which
i
take
it
means,
under
the
principles
of
implied
warranty
laid
down
in
ryan.
and
i'm
sure
that
reed
against
yaka,
if
the
case
came
up
again,
even
with
no
expressed
indemnity
in
the
charter
party,
the
court
would
be
reaching
the
same
result
as
it
did
in
reed
against
yaka.
i
think
the
court
was
laying
down
a
broad
principle
there,
at
least
i
so
--
i
so
read
it.
and
on
this
particular
point,
i
--
i
don't
think
that
the
--
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
stewart
disagree.
their
dissent
was
on
the
expressed
language
of
the
longshoreman's
act,
i
don't
think
they
disagreed
or
they
didn't
express
any
disagreement
with
this
particular
passage
which
we
think
really
declared
the
result
here.
now,
of
course
this
decision
came
out
after
our
ninth
circuit
decision
in
the
instant
case.
the
ninth
circuit
decided
this
case
last
winter
and
reed
against
yaka
was
decided
in
may.
now
that
brings
me
now
to
the
second
point
which
is
really
just
appointed
fairness
as
between
the
parties
and
i've
already
perhaps
touched
on
that
the
--
it's
the
stevedore
who
brings
this
equipment
aboard
has
exclusive
control
and
possession
of
it.
the
stevedore
contractor
owns
the
equipment.
the
shipowner
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
it
except
he
may
have
a
--
a
mate
who
possibly
is
on
the
ship
if
he
asked
to
watch
the
whole
shipment
but
--
and
the
stevedore,
but
bringing
defective
equipment
aboard
puts
the
shipowner
in
a
position
where
under
its
warranty
to
the
injured
men,
it
has
to
bear
a
loss.
the
steve
--
the
stevedore
has
placed
this
loss
upon
the
shipowner.
and
just
as
a
simple
matter
of
fairness,
it
seems
that
the
stevedore
who
has
visited
the
loss
imposed
the
loss
on
the
shipowner
ought
to
indemnify
him.
i've
been
thinking
about
this
and
it
seems
to
me
that
implied
warranties
--
let
me
speak
in
implied
warranty.
it's
--
it's
merely
what
the
parties
probably
would
have
intended
and
would
have
expressed
if
they
had
thought
about
the
matter
and
discussed
it.
and
think
that
if
the
parties
--
if
a
shipowner
and
a
stevedore
thought
about
this
while
they
sit
down
and
they'd
say
something
like
this.
the
shipowner
would
say,
“well
now
mr.
stevedore,
i'm
hiring
you
to
do
the
stevedoring
work
on
my
ship.
you're
an
expert
in
these
matters.
we
rely
upon
you
as
an
expert,”
and
the
cases
have
uniformity
said
that
this
shipowner
does
rely
on
the
stevedore
as
an
expert
in
his
field.
“now
you're
going
to
be
bringing
a
lot
of
equipment
aboard
the
vessel.
it's
your
equipment,
you
have
charge
of
it,
you
know
how
old
it
is,
i
don't.
you'll
be
using
it
in
your
operations
but
you
know,
under
this
law
of
sieracki
and
petterson
why
--
if
any
of
your
equipment
turns
out
to
be
bad
and
somebody
gets
hurt
--
why
--
they're
going
to
hold
me
liable
even
though
it's
your
equipment,
so
i
want
you
to
warranty
to
me
that
any
equipment
you
bring
aboard
will
be
reasonably
fit.
i
don't
ask
if
you
be
an
insurer
or
that
it
be
the
most
perfect
equipment
in
the
world
but
i
ask
you
to
warrant
that
it
will
reasonably
fit
for
the
purpose.”
and
the
fairness
of
that
would
probably
be
apparent
and
the
stevedore
will
probably
say,
"well
sure,
that
seems
fair,
it's
my
equipment.
if
i'm
going
to
put
you
on
a
spot
by
putting
you
in
a
hole
for
my
equipment,
i
ought
to
warrant
it.”
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
yes.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well
mr.
justice
warren,
of
course
the
parties
are
free
to
contract
as
they
please.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
but
it
occurs
to
me
that
that
would
be
an
answer
to
any
implied
warranty
that
we
really
wouldn't
have
any
room
in
the
law
for
implied
warranties
if
you
could
always
say,
"well,
the
parties
are
free
to
write
it
down
in
their
contract
or
agree
to
it,”
so
we
don't
need
implied
warranties.
we
--
we
wouldn't
have
needed
an
implied
warranty
in
ryan
and
crumady,
in
those
cases
because
we
could
have
said,
"well,
the
shipowner
and
the
stevedore
are
free
to
contract,”
if
the
shipowner
wants
to
get
the
stevedore
to
agree
that
his
--
that
to
render
a
workmanlike
service,
he
could
make
him
agree
to
it
expressly.
doesn't
that
the
same
answer
applied
to
--
virtually
all
implied
warranty,
at
least
in
this
field.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well,
that
of
course
is
a
question
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well,
i
would
if
i
thought
about
it.
that's
so
--
that's
why
we
have
to
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
that's
why
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
but
i
think
--
i
think
that's
why
in
all
of
these
implied
warranty
cases,
really
the
parties
haven't
thought
about
it
and
so
they
--
and
they
don't
express
it
so
you
fall
back
on
implied
warranty
and
i
think
that's
why
we
have
implied
warranties
in
the
law.
i'm
talking
now
of
implied
in
facts
in
the
relationship
of
the
parties.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i'm
not
talking
about
implied
in
law,
which
was
different
of
course.
now,
the
stevedore
company
urges
that
this
would
virtually
make
them
an
insurer
and
i
want
to
answer
that
point
briefly.
it
would
not
make
them
an
insurer
because
the
standard
is
not
perfection.
the
standard
as
this
court
laid
down
in
mitchell
against
the
trawler
racing,
is
simply
that
the
article
to
the
gear
be
reasonably
fit,
reasonably
suitable
for
the
purpose
intended.
now,
it's
true
that
the
--
the
warranty
is
absolute,
they
owe
an
absolute
warranty
but
they
don't
warrant
that
no
accident
will
happen
or
they
don't
warrant
that
the
gear
is
absolutely
safe
and
--
and
will
--
and
will
prevent
any
in
all
accidents.
they
merely
warrant
that
the
gear
is
reasonably
suitable
and
reasonably
fit.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
yes,
not
--
well,
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
yes.
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well,
i
think
the
law
is
in
a
state
of
flux.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well,
i
had
not
--
the
briefs
amicus
on
behalf
of
the
government
and
the
associations
went
into
that
much
more
fully
than
i
did.
the
extension
going
from
the
warranty
of
a
manufacturer,
to
the
warranty
of
a
seller,
to
the
warranty
of
a
supplier
and
in
this
case,
i
--
i
guess
it's
a
supplier
and
the
cases
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well
--
well,
no.
he
isn't
selling
it.
in
a
sense,
he
supplies
it
your
honor
because
he
--
he
brings
it
aboard
--
he
brings
it
aboard.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
he
uses
it
--
he
uses
it
and
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
--
he
takes
it
away
again
when
he
leaves.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
that
is
true.
i
do
not
myself
know
of
any
cases.
i
know
that
the
--
the
text
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well,
to
be
honest
with
you,
i
didn't
search
fully
for
those
and
i'd
be
perfectly
candid,
i
--
i
left
a
lot
of
that
to
the
government
and
the
associations
who
wrote
the
briefs
amicus
but
i
feel
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
not,
not
squarely
but
i
remember
of
it.
there
maybe
some
but
i
don't
recall
in
the
briefs
amicus.
the
--
the
difference,
though
that
i
wish
to
point
out
your
honor
here
is
that
i'm
not
asking
the
court
to
adopt
any
broad
rule
as
to
all
independent
contractors
here.
we
are
in
a
field
here
of
maritime
law.
we're
dealing
with
a
maritime
contract
between
people
who
--
who
are
dealing
against
the
background
of
maritime
law.
now,
in
--
in
the
cases
you're
talking
about,
of
course
the
--
the
customer,
the
contractors
had
held
to
an
absolute
liability
to
the
contractors
workmen
that
if
the
contractor
brings
some
defective
equipment
aboard
where
the
customer
is
going
to
be
liable
to
the
contractors
workmen
on
an
absolute
liability.
but
here,
we're
in
a
maritime
field
that
the
parties
know
about
and
the
shipowner
is
going
to
be
held
absolutely
liable
regardless
of
negligence
to
the
--
to
the
very
workmen
employees
of
this
contractor.
so
certainly,
it
seems
that
under
the
circumstances
and
relationship
of
the
parties,
they
would
give
rise
to
a
warranty
here.
and
when
we're
speaking
of
fairness
and
equities
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
yes,
i
think
i
would.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
think
i
would.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
it
--
it
might
not
be
--
strongly,
that
isn't
the
case
we
have.
i
would
take
the
position
that
they
did
and
because
it's
in
a
--
in
--
in
maritime
field
although
we
wouldn't
have
the
same
situation
of
the
vessel
being
held
to
a
strict
liability
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
--
to
the
employee.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
the
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
--
this
court
in
the
--
in
the
ryan
case
and
some
of
the
others
refers
to
the
famous
english
case
of
mowbray
versus
merryweather
where
the
shoe
is
on
the
other
foot.
there,
the
--
the
bit
of
the
ship's
own
gear
was
defective
and
caused
injury
to
an
employee
of
the
stevedore
contractor
and
the
stevedore
contractor
had
to
pay
off
his
employee
and
then
he's
entitled
to
recovery
against
the
vessel
owner.
now,
that
case
is
a
little
fuzzy
because
some
of
these
cases
are
little
fuzzy,
they
speak
of
warranty
and
yet,
it's
little
fuzzy
because
there
maybe
elements
of
negligence
in
the
case.
but
that
mowbray
versus
merryweather
is
one
of
the
leading
cases
where
the
shoe
is
on
the
other
foot
and
they
hold
that
the
shipowner
owes
a
--
a
warranty
to
the
stevedore
contractor
as
it's
here.
now,
the
result
holding
the
stevedore
liable
in
this
case
is
surely
not
merely
so
harsh
on
the
stevedore
as
the
well
set
of
law
of
crumady
against
joachim
fisser
where
the
vessel
owner
furnishes
--
where
the
ship's
equipment
is
unfit
or
unsafe.
now,
in
the
crumady
case,
the
ship
furnished
or
supplied
for
the
work
and
unseaworthy
and
defective
winch,
didn't
have
a
proper
--
didn't
have
its
cutoff
device
set
properly.
and
even
there,
the
stevedore
is
held
liable
in
indemnity
if
it
does
something
that
brings
out
into
play
or
--
or
activates
that
unseaworthiness.
so
here
is
a
case
where
the
shipowner
has
--
really
had
no
part
in
the
thing
at
all
and
has
no
control
over
the
equipment.
and
yet,
speaking
of
equities
and
fairness,
the
--
the
stevedore
the
a
situation
like
this,
even
escapes
his
liability
to
pay
compensation
because
--
although
he
ordinarily
pays
compensation
under
the
federal
longshoremen
and
harbored
workers'
act
to
his
injured
man,
by
the
result
in
this
case
where
the
injured
man
recovers
damages
against
the
ship.
the
injured
man
is
compensated
at
the
expense
of
the
ship.
the
stevedore
goes
off
scot-free
and
yet
he
brought
the
defective
equipment
aboard.
now,
the
final
thing
and
perhaps
this
is
the
most
forceful
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
--
i'm
just
talking
here
in
the
--
the
equities
and
the
fairness.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i'm
pointing
out
that
the
stevedore
company
under
the
federal
longshoremen's
and
harbored
workers'
act
imposed
compensation
and
other
benefits,
medical
benefits.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
to
its
employees.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
regardless
of
fault.
but
in
this
case,
since
the
equipment
furnished
by
the
stevedore
was
defective,
the
injured
man
had
a
perfect
case
of
liability
for
damages
against
the
ship
under
petterson
so
he
makes
his
election,
sues
the
ship
and
recovers
damages.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
yes.
in
other
words,
he
--
he
--
when
he
gets
damages
from
us,
from
the
ship,
as
long
as
those
damages
exceed
what
his
comp
would
be
why
he
takes
his
damages
and
the
stevedore
goes
free
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
he
has
to
pay
it
back.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
and
in
this
case,
did.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
in
this
case,
after
recovering
the
judgment
against
that,
he
has
to
pay
back
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
so
it
--
it's
a
little
--
you
--
you
reach
the
anomalous
result
of
a
kind
of
a
windfall
here
to
the
stevedore
contractor,
their
own
employee
when
they
furnished
defective
equipment
and
yet
they
got
back
whatever
they
paid
out
in
comp,
all
at
the
expense
of
the
shipowner.
now
finally,
does
this
question
of
the
--
the
policy
which
should
be
a
strong
one
in
the
law
to
prevent
injuries
rather
than
merely
compensate
for
them.
the
--
paying
compensation
under
the
shipowner's
absolute
warranty
compensates
for
injuries
but
it
doesn't
prevent
accidents.
there
should
be
--
and
the
rule
should
be
such
that
there
will
be
an
incentive
placed
on
the
party
that's
most
able
to
eliminate,
prevent
the
risks
of
these
accidents.
the
stevedore
companies
bring
vast
amounts
of
gear
and
equipment
on
the
ships.
they
are
the
ones
that
are
in
position
--
in
a
position
to
keep
track
of
that
equipment,
know
how
old
it
is,
take
periodic
tests
if
they
think
that's
necessary
and
eliminate
insofar
as
possible
the
risk
of
accidents
like
this
happening.
now,
the
shipowner
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
this
equipment.
and
if
you
place
the
ultimate
risk
on
the
shipowner,
and
i
submit
you're
not
placing
it
on
the
--
on
the
party
who's
in
the
best
position
to
eliminate
these
accidents.
now,
that
thought
was
strongly
expressed
in
booth
and
by
justice
jertberg
and
by
another
panel
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
degioia
case
where
they
suggest
that
it
should
be
the
policy
of
the
law
to
place
the
ultimate
risk
on
the
party
who
is
in
the
best
position
to
eliminate
it.
now,
i'm
not
talking
here
about
negligence.
the
stevedore
can
probably
satisfy
the
requirements
of
due
care
by
just
having
some
evidence
that
they
inspected
the
equipment,
but
i'm
talking
about
the
opportunity
that
the
stevedore
contractor
has
to
prevent
accidents,
to
go
further
to
eliminate
accidents
and
perhaps
go
beyond
the
call
of
duty
of
ordinary
care
by
keeping
a
record
of
this
equipment.
this
--
in
this
case
that
the
equipment
is
a
very
similar
thing,
just
an
ordinary
piece
of
rope
and
if
they
had
--
undoubtedly,
if
they
renew
that
rope
periodically,
we
wouldn't
have
had
this
accident
or
if
this
--
put
it
to
some
test.
but
of
course
all
they
did
was
look
at
it
and
that
satisfied
the
requirements
of
due
care.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well
after
all,
the
stevedore
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
your
honor,
may
i
answer
that
in
two
ways?
one,
a
--
a
court
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
yes.
and
of
course,
it
was
generally
assumed
under
the
booth
decision
in
booth
against
meier
&
oelhaf,
it
was
generally
assumed
that
the
stevedore
did
have
this
liability.
the
booth
was
decided
by
the
second
circuit
some
five
or
six
years
ago
so
the
stevedores
have
insured
against
this
liability.
now,
it
was
only
this
recent
split
decision
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
cast
dealt
on
that
proposition.
so
in
a
--
a
reversal
here
which
would
be
inconformity
with
booth
would
not
change
the
insurance
picture
at
all
because
the
stevedores
have
had
to
insure
this
liability
ever
since
the
booth
decision
five
or
six
years
ago.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
the
--
i
wouldn't
think
so.even
if
they
have
to
--
even
if
you
only
look
at
the
cost
of
the
insurance
premiums,
the
insurance
premiums
or
a
substantial
cost
of
the
company
doing
business.
and
i
think
if
you
place
the
risk
on
the
stevedore
who
furnishes
this
gear
and
has
the
opportunity
to
keep
track
of
it
and
keep
records,
you
are
putting
the
risk
on
the
part
of
this
--
in
the
best
position
to
in
--
to
--
to
take
ultimate
care
that
this
gear
be
in
the
best
of
conditions
so
that
there
won't
be
any
accidents.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
yes.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well,
this
argument
would
not
apply
to
the
ship.
no,
because
i'm
talking
now
about
the
policy
to
protect
the
injured
workman.
of
course
an
injury
to
the
ship
may
be
an
accident
which
also
cause
injuries
to
workmen.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
--
i'm
--
i'm
arguing
for
indemnity.
i'm
arguing
with
the
indemnity
principles
of
ryan,
should
be
--
should
be
applied
to
the
equipment
bought
aboard
the
vessel.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
that's
exactly
our
point.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
that
--
that's
exactly
my
point.
you've
stated
it
much
more
clearly
for
me
than
i
did
myself.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well,
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
know,
but
it
runs
the
--
it
runs
the
cost
up
to
the
stevedore
if
he's
paying
for
that
insurance.
and
that
puts
the
pressure
on
him.
thank
you.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
have
just
a
couple
of
very
brief
remarks
in
reply,
if
it
please
the
court.
i
think
mr.
fredrickson
and
i
are
in
agreement
that
these
bailment
cases,
many
of
them
are
fuzzy
and
it's
for
that
very
reason
that
we
don't
wish
to
push
the
law
or
ask
that
the
law
be
pushed
beyond
the
confines
of
a
--
of
a
maritime
case
and
i
think
this
may
serve
to
answer
the
question
that
was
in
mr.
justice
white's
mind.
that
here
--
because
the
bailment
cases
are
fuzzy,
it
really
isn't
necessary
to
go
beyond
the
case
here.
we're
dealing
with
maritime
law
where
the
shipowner
owes
this
absolute
warranty
and
where
the
stevedore
has
exclusive
possession
and
use
of
this
and
brings
in
accord
and
makes
the
ship
--
renders
the
ship
liable
and
therefore
it
seems
altogether
fitting
that
there
should
be
the
implied
warranty.
to
advert
just
once
again
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
concerning
the
insurance,
i
--
i
want
to
again
emphasize
that
we
are
not
asking
for
a
change
in
what
has
apparently
been
the
law
because
since
the
booth
case,
it
was
from
--
for
a
bigger
community,
that
is
the
second
circuit,
a
bigger
shipping
community
than
the
ninth
circuit.
why
the
law
has
been
that
the
shipowner
--
i
mean
that
the
stevedore
owes
this
warranty
and
i'm
sure
that
no
place
even
on
the
west
coast
have
stevedores
cancel
their
insurance,
their
liability
insurance
here,
because
of
the
2-to-1
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
pending
before
coming
up
here
on
certiorari.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
don't
recall
it.
it's
given
in
my
briefs
your
honor.
it
was
a
long
--
about
5,
6
years
ago.
now
another
point
on
the
insurance,
i've
pointed
out
that
the
--
in
any
event,
even
if
the
stevedore
has
insurance,
it
still
has
an
incentive
to
go
beyond
the
call
of
ordinary
care
and
take
measures
to
prevent
these
accidents
because
in
the
maritime
field,
it's
common
knowledge
that
your
insurance
rates
are
based
on
your
experience.
it
--
there
--
it
isn't
just
a
uniform
rate
by
all
of
the
insurance
companies
to
all
of
the
stevedores.
it
depends
on
what
their
experiences
been,
how
bad
their
losses
have
been.
and
so,
i
think
that's
an
important
factor
that
realized
that
their
insurance
premiums
are
going
to
be
heavier
if
they
injure
more
men.
and
therefore,
by
putting
on
them
the
burden
here,
there
is
an
incentive
to
avoid
injury
rather
than
simply
shifting
their
burden
under
compensation
on
to
an
innocent
ship
operator.
and
the
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well,
to
some
extent
of
the
very
point
i'm
making
is
that
they
have
to
pay
the
premiums
on
that
insurance
and
the
more
liability
they
have,
the
heavier
those
premiums
will
be.
therefore,
there
is
the
incentive
on
them
to
avoid
this
liability
by
avoiding
the
injury
to
their
men
and
going
beyond
the
ordinary
care
standards
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
pointed
out,
setup
retirement
schedules
for
these
ropes
and
maybe
replace
them
every
6
months
and
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
have
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
not
seen
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
--
i
--
i'm
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
don't
think
there's
much
of
that
in
this
particular
field,
your
honor.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
do
not
in
this
particular
field.
i
think
that
in
manufacturing
plants
ashore
and
things
like
that,
that
is
probably
true.
but
i
think
that
the
insurance
companies
feel
that
the
increase
--
the
increase
in
premiums
due
to
their
experience
rating
is
the
thing
that's
going
to
be
the
incentive.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
oh
yes,
i
think
so.
on
liability,
yes.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
they
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
yes,
it's
--
it's
under
--
it's
not
their
compensation
policy,
it's
under
their
liability
policy
but
those
are
--
those
are
almost
invariably
written
by
the
same
underwriter
and
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
--
and
the
premiums
are
based
on
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
--
based
on
their
experience.
i
--
i
think
i'm
correct.
i'm
sure
i'm
correct
on
that.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
think
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
think
that
might
have
been
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
think
that
at
the
time
ryan
was
decided
that
it
did
create
a
liability
that
perhaps
the
insurance
companies
haven't
really
taken
into
account
but
that
has
long
since
passed
and
they
have
now
accommodated
themselves
to
ryan.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
yes.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well
then
i
hope
you
would
follow
our
thesis
and
follow
booth
which
has
been
a
law
under
which
they've
been
insuring
for
some
5
or
6
years
until
doubt
was
cast
upon
it
by
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
in
this
particular
case.
the
only
other
remark
i
would
have
and
it
has
to
do
again
with
this
question
of,
“who
has
the
best
opportunity
to
eliminate
the
risk
in
these
matters?”
in
mr.
justice
goldberg's
questions
to
mr.
fredrickson
in
his
answers,
i
think
he
conceded
that
that
probably
there
wasn't
very
much
a
ship
could
do
in
the
way
of
inspections
but
it
was
kind
of
a
suggestion
made
that
well
perhaps
the
ship
could
do
something.
and
i
think
it
might
be
pertinent
just
to
read
the
findings
of
fact
in
this
case
bearing
on
that.
page
25
of
the
record,
finding
16
says,
"the
seattle
hatch
tent
and
tent
tie-down
rope
involved
herein
were
owned,
supplied,
rigged
and
exclusively
controlled
by
respondent
at
all
times
material,
said
tent
rope,
was
respondent's
gear
and
equipment."
and
number
18
says,
“the
securing
of
a
tent
and
the
manner
in
which
the
tent
and
tent
rope
were
being
secured
was
entirely
and
exclusively
within
the
supervision
and
control
of
respondent."
so
the
ship
and
its
officers
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
it.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
think
the
court
simply
--
my
recollection
your
honor
is
that
the
court
simply
said
that
the
work
was
being
under
an
oral
contract.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
under
an
oral
contract.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
think
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
i
--
that
is
true,
yes.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well,
i
think
that
leads
us
only
into
the
contract
question
your
honor,
because
subsequent
to
ryan,
there
have
been
many
cases
where
the
work
was
done
under
a
written
contract
that
only
a
written
contract
in
more
or
less
general
terms,
where
the
right
of
indemnity
based
on
implied
warranty
has
been
allowed.
i
--
i
call
to
mind
the
crumady
versus
fisser
i
remember,
involved
a
written
contract
but
one
of
the
questions
really
was
whether
--
and
sort
of
dugan
&
mcnamara
against
waterman,
there
were
written
contracts
but
--
between
other
parties
and
the
court
talked
about
third
party
beneficiary
and
things
of
that
sort.
but
i
mentioned
those
to
show
that
there
have
been
many
cases,
some
here
and
many
in
the
lower
courts
involving
written
contracts
which
had
no
express
provisions
on
this
particular
subject
and
therefore
the
courts
have
said
that
the
implied
warranty
exists.
and
i
think
the
courts
have
--
the
circuits
have
considered
this
and
said
generally,
"the
--
the
implied
warranty
exists
unless
there's
something
in
the
contract
to
negative
it.”
in
other
words
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
well,
then
that
becomes
a
question
of
contract
interpretation
certainly.
and
that
of
course
is
the
question
that
is
--
would
be
reserved
for
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
since
they
--
since
they
expressly
did
not
pass
on
that
question
and
expressly
reserved
the
contract
interpretation.
we
--
we
would
just
have
that
question
--
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
that
would
--
i
--
i
concede
that
that
would
be
open
your
honor
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
the
particular
contract
and
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
drawn
and
who
wrote
it
and
whether
they're
ambiguities
and
whether
that
contract
negatives
the
otherwise
existing
implied
warranty.
in
other
words,
the
implied
warranty
is
what
comes
up
in
the
general
situation
and
then
if
your
contract
of
course,
has
expressed
provisions
and
those
are
construed
to
negative
or
exclude
an
implied
warranty,
why?
that
would
be
the
result.
but
that
would
be
a
matter
of
contract
interpretation.
mr.
erskine
b.
wood
yes,
you
honor.
that
there
--
that
that
would
be
true
under
an
oral
contract
or
under
a
written
contract
which
said
nothing
about
it
and
then
if
you
have
a
written
contract
with
specific
clauses
it
then
becomes
a
matter
of
contract
interpretation
whether
those
clauses
have
negatived
the
implied
warranty.
thank
you
very
much
your
honors.
