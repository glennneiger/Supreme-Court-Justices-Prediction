mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
my
name
is
floyd
fredrickson
from
portland,
oregon.
our
client
is
the
oregon
stevedoring
company.
preliminary
action
just
to
point
to
the
terms
which
i'll
use
and
maybe
they're
already
clear
in
your
mind
but
to
--
when
i
use
the
term
longshoremen,
i
refer
to
the
employee,
the
worker
and
the
term
stevedore
refers
to
the
company
or
the
employer.
now,
it's
--
it's
probably
already
been
developed
here.
there
are
two
premises
with
which
we
start
this
argument.
number
one,
mr.
griffith
has
long
since
had
the
benefit
of
this
warranty
of
seaworthiness
and
has
recovered
his
money
and
has
departed
the
scene.
number
two,
that
the
stevedore
in
this
case
is
free
from
any
negligence
and
that
the
stevedore
has
in
fact
inducted
the
test
and
inspections
required
of
the
industry.
i
might
say
that
in
the
trial
of
this
case,
the
steamship
company
was
given
the
benefit
of
the
res
ipsa
loquitor
doctrine
or
the
inference
of
negligence
and
the
trial
judge
found
that
the
stevedore
company
had
overcome
that
presumption
by
evidence
that
the
trial
of
the
inspections
of
the
equipment
which
they
supplied
to
the
ship.
finding
22,
the
respondent
reasonable
care
provide
the
libellant
with
the
proper
tent
tie-down
rope
and
has
overcome
any
inference
of
negligence
which
might
be
inferred
on
behalf
of
libel
acts.
finding
21,
the
tent
line
was
a
proper
type
of
rope
for
use
and
there
was
no
evidence
that
it
was
in
an
unsatisfactory
condition
so
that
we
start
out
with
the
premise
that
there
is
no
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
stevedore
company
and
that
we
have
in
fact
the
--
the
shipowner
has
failed
in
--
in
proving
any
negligence
or
any
failure
to
conduct
the
test
and
inspections
that
they
indicate
should
be
made.
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
we
agree.
we
take
--
we
take
no
umbrage
with
that
at
all
your
honor.
now,
i
might
say
in
that
respect
that
this
court
has
laid
down
the
guidelines
of
not
interfering
with
findings
of
fact
by
--
of
triers
of
fact
even
in
the
indemnity
situation.
i
refer
your
honors
to
the
atlantic
&
gulfs
stevedore
case
versus
ellerman
lines
in
which
--
in
which
in
the
trial
court
--
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
i'll
pass
that
then,
your
honor.
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
well,
it
seemed
to
me
that
perhaps
no
one
did
question
the
--
the
findings
of
facts
so
far
as
the
lack
of
negligence
are
concerned.
it
seems
to
us
then
that
this
case
lays
open
to
bear
question
of
whether
the
stevedore
hasn't
insured
of
its
equipment,
reasonable
fitness
of
its
equipment.
now,
as
mr.
wood
has
indicated,
of
course
this
is
an
admiralty
case
and
the
federal
laws
the
--
is
the
law
which
is
applicable
to
federal
common
law.
and
the
ryan
case
was
the
initial
case
which
imposed
the
warranty
of
workmanlike
service
on
the
stevedore
company.
and
of
course
in
the
ryan
case,
the
court
came
out
with
this
definition
of
--
of
workmanlike
service.
the
court
in
the
ryan
case
was
concerned
with
the
halcyon
case
which
preceded
it.
in
the
halcyon
case,
this
court
had
determined
that
the
shipowner
could
not
recover
from
a
stevedore
company
on
a
tort
theory
because
of
no
contribution
among
tortfeasors
and
they
would
not
apply
the
admiralty
rule
of
--
by
the
damages
in
non-collision
cases.
so
the
court
was
faced
with
a
situation
of
say
a
stevedore
which
was
75%
negligent
and
a
shipowner
maybe
25%
negligent,
the
shipowner
can't
make
any
recovery
from
the
stevedore
company
because
of
the
--
of
the
halcyon
rule.
so
the
court
said,
"we
must
lay
this
on
principles
of
contract,"
which
they
did
and
they
said
that
there
is
this
warranty,
this
implied
warranty
which
flows
out
of
the
relationship.
now,
they
did
not
say
or
this
court
did
not
say
that
the
stevedore
owed
a
warranty
of
seaworthiness
to
the
shipowner.
the
shipowner's
warranty
to
a
longshoreman
or
a
seaman
aboard
the
ship
is
a
warranty
of
seaworthiness
as
if
this
court
has
said
a
liability
without
fault.
this
court
did
not
say
in
the
ryan
case
that
the
stevedore
owed
a
warranty
of
seaworthiness
to
the
shipowner.
it
said
it
owed
a
warranty
of
workmanlike
service.
now,
the
--
the
question
in
this
case
of
course
--
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
well,
your
--
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
--
your
honor,
it
doesn't
arrive
in
our
field
because
we
have
the
longshoreman
and
harbored
workers'
act
in
anything
that
occurs
offshore
and
the
state
acts
so
far
as
anything
occurs
onshore
and
the
stevedore
company
is
never
faced
with
a
problem
of
the
appellee.
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
the
--
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
yes
and
i
think
the
liability
of
the
shipowner
is
--
is
more
far
reaching
than
the
fela.
for
example,
the
fela
your
honor
does
refer
to
negligence.
now,
this
court
has
said,
"that's
just
a
scintilla
rule."
but
still
your
honor,
there
has
to
be
a
finding
of
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
employer.
now,
the
--
the
--
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
that's
correct,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
now,
the
three
cases
as
my
opponent
has
pointed
out
that
it
come
down
particularly
since
the
--
since
the
ryan
case
are
weyerhaeuser
versus
nacirema,
the
crumady
case
and
waterman
versus
dugan
&
mcnamara.
now,
in
each
of
those
cases,
each
of
these
three
cases,
there
is
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
stevedore
company's
employees.
so
inline
of
those
cases,
do
we
reach
the
question
involved
here
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
weyerhaeuser
versus
nacirema,
this
court
said
that
the
principles
of
liability
of
the
shipowner
to
the
longshoreman
or
the
seaman
aren't
different
than
the
principles
of
liability
between
the
shipowner
and
the
stevedore,
and
this
is
simply
our
--
the
basis
for
our
position
in
this
case.
we
recognize
of
course
as
we
must
that
the
shipowner
is
responsible
for
unseaworthiness,
a
liability
without
fault.
but
our
position
simply
is
that
our
position,
vis-à-vis
the
shipowner
is
that
there
must
be
some
fault
on
our
part,
some
fault,
some
negligence.
now,
--
(inaudible)
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
yes.
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
no,
no.
in
this
case,
against
the
shipowner.
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
oh
certainly.
from
--
yes
--
yes,
sir
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
oh
yes,
that's
correct.
we
--
we
would
be
required
to
pay
him
compensation
without
regard
to
any
--
yeah
as
you
pointed
out
justice.
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
the
longshoreman
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
yes.
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
oh
you
mean
our
liability
under
the
longshoreman
harbor
workers'
act.
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
well,
i
suppose
so
except
--
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
yes,
but
that
absolutely
liability
your
honor
is
a
very
limited
one
in
the
sense
of
the
certain
amount
of
weekly
compensation.
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
and
--
and
certainly
if
there
are
some
partial
disabilities,
some
--
some
awards,
some
sort
of
course
--
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
shipowner?
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
that
is
true,
your
honor.
and
as
--
and
is
might
--
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
the
--
the
longshoreman
himself
is
required
to
reimburse
the
stevedore
company
for
his
compensation
that
he
received
under
the
act.
of
course
--
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
oh
yes,
but
in
a
practical
sense
your
honor
that
in
almost
every
case
now,
we
turn
around
and
get
sued
by
this
steamship
company
for
the
amount
that
it
had
to
pay
out.
so
in
that
sense,
we're
in
worst
position,
i
might
say.
now,
if
i
might
turn
to
reed
versus
yaka
for
just
--
for
just
a
moment.
i
--
i
think
it's
--
it's
clear
of
course
that
--
that
the
court
in
that
case
wasn't
concerned
with
our
problem,
as
it's
been
indicated.
mr.
reed
filed
a
libel
in
rem
against
this
vessel
and
it's
been
bareboat
chartered
to
his
employer.
and
the
owner
of
the
ship
wouldn't
have
--
didn't
--
didn't
have
any
responsibility
because
the
unseaworthiness
role
is
after
the
chartering.
and
the
--
we
have
thought
that
the
man's
employer
didn't
have
any
liability
to
--
at
as
to
the
charter
because
he
was
also
the
man's
employer
protected
under
the
longshoreman
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act.
and
that
is
--
is
a
problem
that
faced
the
court
in
--
in
that
case
and
that
stevedore
was
responsible
because
he
happens
to
also
be
a
shipowner
and
operator
and
would
be
responsible
under
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
to
a
longshoreman
so
that
--
that
case
did
not
concern
the
issue
that's
facing
us
here.
and
further
as
we
indicated
in
our
brief,
in
fact
in
the
district
court's
opinion,
there
was
absolute
expressed
written
hold-harmless
agreement
between
the
shipowner
and
the
stevedore
bareboat
charter.
and
there
was
no
question
that
if
liability
was
visited
on
the
shipowner
that
it
would
be
passed
on
to
the
stevedore
bareboat
charter
as
the
expressed
contract
hold
and
harmless
for
everything
that
occurs
during
the
course
of
operation.
now
--
and
i
might
say
further,
i
--
i
think
the
reed
case
is
an
example
of
--
of
this
court's
concern
for
people
who
don't
have
the
opportunity
to
make
a
contract
to
protect
themselves.
mr.
--
mr.
reed
obviously
didn't
know
whether
the
bareboat
charter
of
the
ship
was
his
employer
or
the
man
in
the
moon.
and
this
court
said,
“it's
unfair
in
that
instance,”
that
because
his
employer
happened
to
be
the
bareboat
charter,
that
his
employer
could
escape
liability
for
this
condition
of
the
ship.
and
they
--
they
--
you
visited
liability
on
the
--
on
the
stevedore
company
there
but
i
think
primarily,
because
we
have
the
--
the
economic
unequal
situation.
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
yes,
this
was
a
--
not
a
jury
case
your
honor.
yes,
yes.
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
oh,
i
agree,
your
honor.
there
are
three
steps
that
should
be
taken
but
i
--
i
think
it
ties
in
with
--
with
something
mr.
justice
white
expressed
it
for
that
the
stevedore
company
is
not
a
manufacture
of
any
equipment.
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
yes.
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
that
we
had
in
fact
that
--
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
i
think
there
was
--
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
i
think
there
was
also
evidence
we
did
that
your
honor
but
of
course
not
on
the
record.
your
honor,
i
--
i
don't
know
what
effect,
imposing
an
absolute
warranty
we'd
have.
now,
we've
already
discussed
the
question
of
insurance,
what
you're
really
talking
about
is
two
insurance
companies.
i
suppose
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
real
answers
is
--
is
that
these
people,
the
shipowner
and
stevedore
are
not
remote
consumers
of
somebody's
goods.
they're
dealing
at
arm's
length
and
they
make
contracts
between
each
other.
and
all
this
work
is
done
in
the
--
in
terms
in
the
--
in
the
background
of
a
written
contract.
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
right,
correct.
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
oh,
we
agree,
we
agree,
we
agree.
but
i
just
say
that
--
that
an
answer
to
justice
goldberg
that
that
up
here,
you've
got
two
people
who
were
agreeing
by
contract
who's
going
to
be
responsible.
i
might
say
further
that
at
that
point
mr.
justice
that
i
think
if
there
are
many
instances
in
which
the
shipowner
could
do
something
--
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
now
you
--
if
you
were
restricting
to
this
--
this
particular
case,
i
don't
know
but
i
take
it
that
there
would
be
situations
perhaps
where
the
shipowner
himself
could
do
something
to
be
sure
the
condition
is
safe.
now,
if
we
make
it
an
absolute
warranty
then
you
take
the
reverse
of
your
argument
and
say
what
--
what
incentive
is
there
for
the
shipowner
to
do
anything,
none.
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
no,
he
doesn't
do
that.
well,
i
--
i
think
mr.
justice
that
--
that
there's
no
question
that
the
shipowner
does
make
very
periodic,
regular,
frequent
inspections
of
the
work
as
it's
in
the
course
of
progress
that
in
fact
if
the
mate
doesn't
like,
if
--
if
a
mate
comes
down
and
says,
"you
brought
a
three-quarter
inch
rope
and
we
need
a
one-inch
rope."
he
has
authority
on
that
ship
and
you
stop
and
you
do
what
he
tells
you
to
do.
and
longshoremen
sometimes
like
to
sit
down
for
an
hour
while
they
change
ropes.
if
i
could
pass
on
then,
it
is
also
true
that
the
court
of
appeals'
cases
that
have
been
--
that
have
come
down
subsequent
to
ryan,
neither
of
them
have
reached
this
problem
either
except
the
--
the
two
cases
that
are
the
background
of
this
case
here,
the
booth
case
which
was
eluded
to
by
my
opponent
in
which
that
circuit
said,
"there
should
be
a
little
--
an
absolute
warranty
so
far
as
the
suppliers,
equipment
is
concerned
and
this
case
--
the
case
at
bar
which
the
ninth
circuit
says
"no".
so
that
your
honor,
the
other
court
of
appeals'
decisions
that
we've
been
able
to
find
that
--
that
our
concern
with
this
--
this
problem.
now,
i
might
say
that
the
--
the
thrust
of
the
government's
brief
which
we
have
tried
to
answer
in
some
respect
in
our
brief
is
to
rely
on
common
law
of
state
--
common
law
cases.
and
of
course
as
i've
indicated,
the
state
common
law
doesn't
control
here
anyway
because
your
honors
are
the
authorities
so
far
as
the
maritime
contract
is
concerned.
now
--
but
turning
for
a
moment
to
the
state
cases,
we
of
course
concede
that
a
manufacturer
or
seller
does
have
a
warranty
or
does
there
--
goes
with
this
product,
a
warranty
of
the
fitness
of
it
and
primarily,
i
think
it's
because
of
the
uniform
sales
act
which
is
provided
so
by
statute
--
i
--
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
i
--
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
as
we
took
the
recess,
we
were
getting
into
the
discussion
of
the
bailor-bailee
common
law
which
is
primarily
contained
in
the
--
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
government
in
this
case
in
the
discussion
of
--
of
--
of
that
case
at
--
and
on
the
theory
of
the
government
that
our
position
is
somewhat
like
bailor.
of
course,
we
should
keep
in
mind
that
in
this
instance,
the
maritime
law
that
while
these
cases
may
have
something
to
do
by
way
of
analogy,
they're
not
controlling
so
far
as
the
relationships
between
a
stevedore
and
a
shipowner
are
concerned.
now,
in
looking
at
the
cases
i
believe
that
the
fairest
thing
probably
that
my
opponent
could
expect
would
--
would
be
that
the
booth
case
would
look
at
this
cases
and
say
that
there
is
some
law
in
the
bailor-bailee
field
that
makes
the
bailor
subject
to
the
same
warranties
that
a
manufacturer
or
seller
has.
now,
you
read
the
booth
opinion
and
the
court
in
the
booth
opinion
says,
i
won't
quote
exactly,
but
the
appellant,
the
shipowner
in
the
booth
case
has
cited
to
us
many
cases
in
the
bailor-bailee
field.
we've
read
them
and
we
find
that
they
all
involve
negligence.
negligence
is
always
a
factor
in
these
cases.
and
the
booth
--
the
court
in
the
booth
case
looks
at
the
mowbray
case
referred
to
by
my
opponent
this
morning,
it's
an
old
english
queen's
bench
case.
and
in
that
case,
a
shipowner
supplied
through
a
stevedore
a
piece
of
gear
which
failed
and
a
stevedore
was
subject
to
liability
to
one
of
the
longshoremen.
then
the
question
was
whether
the
stevedore
company
could
recover
indemnity
from
a
steamship
company
which
had
supplied
this
piece
of
gear.
but
the
question
that
the
court
faced
in
the
mowbray
case
was
whether
or
not
a
stevedore
which
itself
could
have
inspected
it,
this
gear
and
seen
the
defect
could
recover
from
a
supplier,
the
shipowner.
in
other
words,
the
defect
in
that
case
was
visible
and
could
have
been
seen
and
the
--
the
court
in
the
booth
case
frankly
says
that
that's
--
that's
the
way
we
read
the
mowbray
case.
the
court
in
the
booth
case
also
looks
at
this
hoisting
engine
company
case,
a
case
cited
promptly
by
the
government
and
says
that
in
that
case
also,
the
court
was
very
careful
in
saying
that
inspection
by
the
supplier
would've
determined
if
there
were
a
defect
in
this
--
in
the
equipment
supplied.
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
that's
--
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
that's
right.
other
than
--
if
you
get
into
the
sales
field
i'm
--
i'm
admitting
that
--
that
--
right,
right,
right.
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
that's
--
that's
the
way
i
read
them.
i
might
say
mr.
justice
white
that
they
cite
the
cavallo
(ph)
case
very
prominently,
a
case
in
which
a
new
york
roller
skating
rink
supplied
one
of
its
patrons
with
some
roller
skates
and
she
skated
away
sometime
after
she
had
got
the
skates,
the
wheel
collapsed
and
she
fell
off
and
was
hurt.
and
the
new
york
court
does
say
as
part
of
its
opinion,
that
the
rink
owed
her
a
warranty
of
the
fitness
of
those
skates
but
however,
they
also
found
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
new
york
skating
rink
on
the
basis
of
testimony
that
you
could
have
seen
that
a
locknut
on
the
end
of
this
skate
was
not
holding
it
so
that
the
--
the
statement
is
--
is
just
to
have
a
dicta.
and
i'm
frank
to
admit
your
honor
that
so
are
the
cases
that
i've
cited
for
the
other
proposition
that
a
bailor
only
has
an
obligation
of
reasonable
inspection
because
i've
cited
to
your
honors
some
horse
rental
cases
in
which
the
court
also
found
negligence.
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
that's
generally
true,
yes.
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
that
--
that
--
that
is
a
distinction
in
the
facts.
mr.
floyd
a.
fredrickson
i
--
i
admit
that's
a
distinction
in
the
facts.
the
court's
haven't
--
haven't
placed
it
on
that
basis
as
in
--
it
isn't
in
the
facts
of
the
cases
that
the
government
has
cited
nor
in
mine.
i
--
i
think
the
point
is
that
there
just
is
no
common
law
analogy
that
we
can
look
to
that
has
a
determinative
answer
to
--
to
this
case.
even
the
--
the
--
the
commentators
that
are
referred
to
rather
generously
by
the
government
say
that
sadly
enough
we
don't
find
the
--
the
authority
that
would
hold
as
we
think
it
should
be.
in
other
words
that
in
--
in
a
non-sales
case
that
a
warranty
of
fitness
will
be
implied.
now,
(inaudible)
which
is
not
cited
in
my
brief
and
i
don't
know
that
that
it's
too
important
but
that
(inaudible)
2d.150,
the
implied
warranty
of
fitness
for
breach
of
which
the
bailor
maybe
--
maybe
held
liable
is
not
an
absolute
warranty
so
as
to
make
the
bailor
an
insurer
against
injury
to
the
bailee
under
all
circumstances.
but
as
rather
a
warranty
by
the
bailor
that
he
has
exercised
reasonable
care
to
ascertain
that
the
chattel
is
safe
and
suitable
for
the
purpose
for
which
it's
hired.
now,
we've
met
that
test
in
this
case.
as
--
as
we
all
agree,
that
--
that
test
is
behind
us.
now,
i
referred
this
court
to
another
perhaps
analogy
in
the
common
law
field.
a
supplier
who
was
primarily
engaged
in
furnishing
services
as
distinguished
from
equipment
and
i've
referred
your
honors
to
some
of
the
blood
transfusion
cases,
perlmutter
from
new
york
and
so
on,
where
the
courts
--
where
a
patient
in
a
hospital
receives
blood
that
is
unfit
for
his
system.
and
--
and
--
and
the
patient
says
well
--
or
his
administrator
usually
says
that
there's
a
warranty
of
the
fitness
of
this
blood
that's
supplied.
it
doesn't
matter
if
--
if
the
hospital
took
every
step
necessary
to
protect
its
patient.
there's
a
warranty
and
the
courts
have
refused
to
apply
a
warranty
in
that
instance
saying
that
they
served
--
that
the
contract
when
you
get
in
the
hospital
is
primarily
one
for
services.
and
we
make
the
same
contention
so
far
as
a
stevedore
is
concerned.
primarily,
what
the
ship
is
hiring
is
longshoreman.
it
is
true
that
we
bring
aboard
gear
incidental
to
our
work
and
so
on.
but
primarily,
what
the
--
what
the
shipowner
is
hiring
is
a
service.
its
--
its
hiring
longshoreman
that
we
employ.
now,
as
i
say
again,
i
don't
think
that
the
bailor-bailee
cases
in
the
common
law
field
advance
the
ball
one
way
or
the
other
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned.
i
--
i
think
merely
in
closing,
refer
to
some
of
the
policy
questions
that
have
been
--
been
raised
by
my
opponent
and
perhaps
by
the
court,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
the
question
is
--
was
where
--
where
do
we
want
to
go
from
here?
now,
the
--
between
the
longshoremen
and
the
shipowner,
we
all
agree
that
there
is
a
warranty
of
seaworthiness,
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
fault.
that
is
behind
us.
and
the
--
why
--
why
is
that
there?
well,
as
this
court
has
said
for
--
for
two
reasons,
the
shipowner
is
better
able
to
pay.
he's
an
economic
--
or
the
longshoreman
is
an
economic
unequal.
also,
this
court
has
analogized
the
longshoremen
to
the
seaman.
instead
the
longshoreman
is
doing
work
traditionally
done
by
seaman.
and
there's
a
whole
developmental
history
of
--
of
the
warranty
of
seaworthiness
as
it
extends
to
seamen
which
isn't
applicable
to
the
situation
between
stevedore
company
and
shipowner.
and
there's
--
the
second
reason
is
that
the
longshoreman,
the
individual
longshoreman
when
he
goes
aboard
the
ship,
he
doesn't
have
--
is
in
any
position
to
make
a
contract
as
to
what
warranties
will
be
extended
to
him.
as
is
the
situation
so
far
as
--
as
the
shipowner
and
stevedore.
now
i
make
this
point
for
the
reason
that
i
--
i
don't
believe
there's
any
compelling
reason
for
this
court
to
im
--
imply
an
absolute
warranty
so
far
as
the
stevedore
is
concerned
in
its
relations
to
a
steamship
company
as
there
was
for
the
court
to
do
it
in
the
situation
of
an
individual
longshoreman
or
a
seaman.
shipowners
and
stevedores
are
at
least,
economic
equals
and
--
and
perhaps
more
tends
toward
the
--
the
steamship
company
having
a
more
to
say
about
how
the
contracts
are
going
to
be
drawn
because
my
bailees
is
not
really
in
the
record,
stevedores
compete
for
business
when
a
ship
comes
in.
and
the
steamship
company
is
the
one
who
can
call
the
shot
so
to
speak
as
to
what
--
what
kind
of
contracts
you're
going
to
have
to
perform
the
work.
so
that
i
say
that
--
that
the
reasons
for
the
court
giving
a
warranty
of
seaworthiness
to
a
longshoreman
are
not
applicable
vis-a-vis
steamship
company
and
--
and
--
and
stevedore.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
shipowners
do
make
contracts
and
we
have
one
in
this
case
of
course.
and
there's
no
--
there's
no
compelling
need
to
require
a
stevedore
company
to
be
a
guarantor
of
its
equipment.
we
make
the
point
that
making
us
responsible
for
negligence,
implying
that
or
--
or
making
an
implied
warranty
in
our
agreements
that
--
that
we're
responsible
for
negligence,
that
if
we
see
that
a
condition
is
not
as
it
should
be
and
we
go
ahead
and
work
or
we
negligently
--
negligently
supply
something,
i
think
that's
enough.
you
--
you
--
you've
gone
as
far
as
--
as
need
be
in
--
in
the
situation
as
it
is
in
our
industry.
now,
i
think
also
that
--
that
the
point
of
who
is
better
able
to
control
this
situation
about
the
equipment
is
someone
begs
the
question
because
here
we
do
--
the
shipowner
can
sue
us
of
course
and
is
--
is
a
given,
an
inference
of
negligence
as
he
was
in
this
case.
and
what
happened
actually
was
the
shipowner
failed
in
its
proof.
even
--
given
the
advantages
of
the
inference
still
the
--
the
testimony
from
our
side
that
we
had
inspected,
that
we
had
made
a
test,
overcame
that
presumption.
i
think
the
nub
of
the
case
is
that
--
is
that
--
the
shipowner
has
this
onerous
burden
of
--
of
unseaworthiness.
he
--
he
--
he
wants
to
pass
it
on
--
he
wants
to
pass
it
on
to
somebody
else.
but
as
this
court
has
said,
the
shipowners'
responsibility
vis-a-vis
the
longshoreman
is
on
different
principles
than
the
responsibilities
between
shipowner
and
stevedore
company
and
that
there
is
no
warranty
of
seaworthiness
between
stevedore
company
and
shipowner
and
no
reason
to
--
to
extend
it.
we
simply
say
that
liability
with
fault
is
a
sufficient
test
to
charge
a
stevedore
company.
and
that's
the
position
we
take
in
this
case
and
we
believe
it's
--
it's
justified
by
what
this
court
has
said
previously
and
by
the
facts
in
the
industry.
thank
you
very
much.
