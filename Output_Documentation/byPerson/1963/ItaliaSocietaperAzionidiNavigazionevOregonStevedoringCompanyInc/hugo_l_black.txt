justice

(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
after
all
these
questions
--
one
of
the
questions
involved
i
suppose
is
what's
been
infected?
insurance
were
--
what
are
we
going
to
do,
are
we
going
to
break
up
the
practice
required
chain
that
--
why
does
he
buy
the
insurance
policies
after
he
went
to
for
a
new
ship
and
a
new
realignment
of
cause?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
saying
you're
not
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
it's
--
it's
a
matter
of
irrelevant
so
far
as
imposing
liability
to
prevent
accidents
in
the
future
which
company
has
appeals.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
if
--
if
it's
merely
a
question
of
which
insurance
company
is
going
to
have
to
put
the
pressure
on
him
and
make
him
do
the
right
thing,
what
difference
does
it
make
to
the
policy
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
if
you
(inaudible)
not
only
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
the
fact
that
they
can
insure
1643,
isn't
it?
the
policy
you're
talking
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
making
it
as
a
matter
of
actual
practice,
insurance
(inaudible)
themselves,
put
considerable
(inaudible)
insurance
in
a
certain
field
in
connection
with
refusing
--
possibility
of
refusing
liability.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they're
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
first
a
question
of
certainty
of
liability
in
connection
with
(inaudible)
i
asked
this
because
one
of
my
chief
objections
when
i
had
(inaudible)
laws
that
the
insurance
policies
seems
to
have
been
--
contracts
and
rates
seems
to
have
been
built-up
up
to
that
time
on
an
entirely
different
period
(inaudible)
obtaining
it,
to
that
period
would
simply
shift
liability
so
that
policies
already
in
existence
were
--
could
have
quite
a
different
effect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
be
for
the
future
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
about
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
and
therefore
i
don't
want
to
make
another
break
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
which
would
bring
about
another
situation
where
they're
endangered
because
of
the
shifts
in
the
law,
to
liabilities.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
was
any
--
defendants
put
on
the
fact
(inaudible)
there
was
no
written
contract
which
could
(inaudible)
the
parties?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
an
oral
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
the
parties
have
made
no
written
contract
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
setting
out
the
terms.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
do
you
think
about
the
effects
of
that
on
your
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
it
takes
up
the
question
of
warranty.
how
much
they
do
want?
what
would
you
say
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
still
be
open
for
a
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
is
if
i
understand
you,
if
nothing
is
--
whatever
was
said
about
warranty
in
the
contract,
they
can
determine
between
the
two
parties
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
there
is
an
implied
warranty
subject
to
(inaudible)
