mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
thweatt.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
--
may
it
please
the
court.
if
the
court
in
this
case
takes
the
view
that
this
entire
case
should
have
been
tried
to
a
jury,
we
nevertheless
submit
that
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
denial
of
a
jury
trial
was
harmless
error.
now,
i
want
to
briefly
relate
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
--
a
woman
by
the
name
of
hettie
lowder,
who
is
in
her
80s,
owns
a
240-acre
farm
situated
in
logan
county,
oklahoma.
in
1953,
she
executed
a
five-year
oil
and
gas
lease
covering
160-acres
in
kind
out
of
this
240-acre
farm.
this
lease
by
named
assignment
became
owned
by
a
man
by
the
name
of
w.
g.
haun.
mr.
haun
assigned
the
lease
to
herman
hurst,
reserving
an
overriding
royalty
of
1/16th
of
7/8ths
of
all
production
and
that
assignment
on
its
face
provided
that
the
--
this
reservation
was
made
applicable
not
only
to
that
1953
oil
and
gas
lease,
but
also
to
any
extensions
or
renewal
of
that
lease.
the
meekers
and
domestic
oil
corporation
and
other
parties
whose
names
are
of
no
importance
here,
were
--
became
the
owners
of
this
oil
and
gas
lease.
they
had
a
block
of
acreage
and
we're
going
to
drill
on
the
robinson
farm
which
abuts
on
this
hettie
lowder
farm.
the
robinson
well
on
the
robinson
farm
was
commenced
in
this
five-year
lease
which
didn't
name
to
herman
hurst
but
was
actually
owned
by
the
plaintiffs
here,
meekers
and
domestic
oil
corporation,
was
about
to
expire.
so
mr.
hurst
went
to
mrs.
lowder
and
got
a
30-day
oil
and
gas
lease,
the
primary
term
to
commence
after
expiration
of
the
existing
lease.
that
term
was,
i
believe,
had
a
term
--
term
of
30
days
from
july
3rd,
1958
--
i
mean,
from
june
3rd,
1958
to
july
3,
1958.
and
that
30-day
lease,
now
that's
a
regular
form
of
oil
and
gas
lease
which
provides
that
it
shall
endure
for
the
primary
term
of
the
lease
which
was
30
days,
and
as
long
thereafter
as
there
is
production
or
under
the
oklahoma
law
as
long
thereafter
as
drilling
operations
or
operations
on
the
lease
are
pursued
with
due
diligence.
well
this
--
during
the
last
two
days
of
this
30-day
oil
and
gas
lease,
the
robinson
well
wasn't
down
yet.
they
didn't
know
the
results
--
what
the
result
of
the
robinson
well
would
be,
so
mr.
hurst
calls
the
location
of
the
estate
on
the
30-day
oil
and
gas
lease,
that
is
--
that's
the
initial
operation
of
course
for
commencing
an
oil
well,
let's
take
the
location.
he
calls
that
to
be
done
and
there
were
$60
worth
of
bulldozer
work
done
before
the
primary
term
of
that
lease
expired.
the
trial
court
found
that
there
was
a
small
circulating
pit
and
roads
that
have
been
built.
there
was
no
machinery
of
any
kind
moved
on
to
the
lease,
nothing
done,
other
than
that
little
bit
of
bulldozer
work.
but
on
july
22nd,
now
that
reminds
you
that
happened
on
july
2nd
and
july
3rd,
that
bulldozer
work
was
done
on
that
lease
at
1958.
on
july
22nd,
a
representative
from
ambassador
oil
corporation
went
over
there
and
surveyed
the
situation
and
found
what
had
been
done
and
--
and
concluded
that
the
--
the
--
that
lease
had
been
abandoned,
that
there
was
no
oil
and
gas
lease
covering
that
tract
of
land.
and
he
consult
--
he
consulted
counsel
about
that
and
it
was
advised
by
counsel
that
in
judgment
of
counsel,
that
30-day
lease
had
terminated
and
was
dead.
so
on
july
22nd,
ambassador
oil
corporation
procured
from
hettie
lowder
or
bought
from
her
an
oil
and
gas
lease
which
covered
not
only
the
160-acres
which
is
covered
by
the
30-day
lease
but
also
covered
the
other
80-acres.
in
other
words,
it
covered
240-acres
and
distinguished
from
160-acres.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
for
that
lease,
ambassador,
$1800,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
the
lease
reserves
a
1/8
royalty,
yes
sir.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes,
sir.
so
they
paid
her
in
cash,
that's
the
bonus
in
consideration
of
$1800
which
they
called
a
--
that's
the
bonus
and
the
royalty
which
was
1/8
from
production.
alright,
now
that
as
i
say,
that
happened
after
the
facts
had
been
disclosed
to
counsel,
ask
to
investigate
the
situation
and
the
counsel
had
told,
"ambassador,
that
lease
is
dead."
so
they
go
buy
the
lease
and
in
due
course,
of
course
ambassador
is
a
company,
the
leases
have
to
be
processed
through
the
right
--
right
in
their
channels,
their
main
office
is
in
fort
worth.
their
lease
was
put
on
record,
i
believe
in
about
august
8.
i'm
not
really
sure.
but
anyways,
shortly
after
they
acquired
the
lease,
the
lease
was
put
on
record.
now,
still
nothing
done
under
this
30-day
lease,
nothing
done
but
the
land
had
been
--
the
bulldozer
work
had
been
done
out
there,
the
--
related
to
the
court.
in
the
first
part
of
september,
about
september
7th
or
6th,
without
any
examination
of
title,
now
that's
unusual
for
that
to
happen
because
ordinarily
oil
company
and
anybody
drilling
a
well
is
very
particular
to
investigate
the
title
and
find
out
that
somebody
hasn't
done
what
the
plaintiff
claims,
ambassador
did
here,
jumped
their
claim
or
jumped
their
lease.
and
--
but
they
didn't
examine
the
title
any
further
and
moved
in.
domestic
was
the
operator
and
now
i
say
they
--
now,
that's
--
that's
domestic
and
meeker
and
other
parties
who
owned
the
working
interest.
in
other
words,
they
were
the
drilling
parties.
the
royalty
interest,
of
course
is
a
free
interest,
an
overriding
royalty
if
this
is
--
the
court
knows
as
a
free
interest.
but
anyway,
the
parties
that
owned
the
working
interest,
they
started
the
well.
domestic
was
the
operator
and
moved
the
rig
in
and
commenced
drilling.
that's
on
this
--
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes
sir.
it
was
the
local
--
the
oklahoma
oil
corporation
was
managed
by
--
the
president
of
the
company
was
the
man
by
the
name
of
brook,
ed
brook
who
testified
in
this
case.
he
was
in-charge
of
the
operations.
well,
--
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
well,
the
--
see
the
--
under
the
30-day
lease,
that
created
a
7/8ths
working
interest,
one-eighth
royalty
being
reserved
to
the
landowner
and
subject
to
this
haun
overriding
the
1/16th
of
7/8th.
in
other
words
--
now
that
--
that
lease,
the
30-day
lease,
created
a
7/8th
working
interest
subject
to
whatever
overrides
and
now
the
burdens
were
against
it.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
the
--
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
that
was
in
hurst
and
meeker
and
domestic
and
whoever
owned
that
lease.
see
that
--
no
question
about
the
plaintiff,
meeker,
having
an
interest
in
that
30-day
lease.
and
then
ambassador
came
along
and
took
a
new
oil
and
gas
lease,
an
independent
oil
and
gas
lease.
see,
ambassadors
took
the
position,
the
30-day
lease
has
terminated.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes,
september,
that's
domestic.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
they
were
--
before
meeker,
the
plaintiff
here,
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
see,
the
--
there
is
no
work
under
the
30-day
lease.
that's
the
bull
--
the
bulldozer
work
that
i
mentioned
a
minute
ago.
that
was
performed
by
domestic
or
by
hurst.
they've
treat
it
as
being
--
for
the
benefit
of
the
30-day
lease.
and
the
work
which
was
commenced
in
september
was
presumably
under
that
30-day
lease.
i
mean,
that's
what
domestic
was
doing
it
for.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
no,
no,
ambassador
got
--
after
the
--
oh,
you
mean
after
the
september
work?
oh,
well
after
the
september,
after
this
lease
--
i
think
that's
worked
on
about
6th
or
7th
of
september
of
1958.
why
somehow,
some
representative
of
ambassador
happened
to
know
this,
the
fact
that
a
drilling
had
been
commenced
on
that
farm.
when
i
was
called
by
a
representative
of
ambassador
and
he
said,
"must
we
be
--
they
commenced
drilling
out
there
on
that
tract."
so
i
immediately
picked
up
the
telephone,
called
mr.
ed
brook
who
was
president
of
--
of
domestic
oil
corporation
and
--
and
told
him
that
ambassador
claimed
they
owned
the
oil
and
gas
lease
on
that
tract
of
land
that
they
were
drilling
a
free
well
for
ambassador.
and
of
course
that
calls
some
consternation.
here
--
in
other
words,
the
30-day
--
the
domestic
was
drilling
under
the
30-day
lease
which
ambassador
said
it
terminated.
ambassador
had
an
oil
and
gas
lease
which
it
had
obtained
on
july
22nd
and
which
it
was
placed
to
record
august
8th,
so
there
were
two
oil
and
gas
leases
which
were
in
opposition
to
each
other.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes
sir,
because
the
robinson
well
turned
out
to
--
it
turned
out
to
be
a
productive
well.
i
think
it
was
completed
either
--
it
was
on
the
processes
of
completion
about
the
time
this
work
(inaudible)
--
this
bulldozer
worker
was
done.
now,
i
think
they
recently
said
and
probably
knew
that
they
were
going
to
have
a
well.
now,
the
feature
of
this
case
and
of
disturbed
judge
rizley
was
the
fact
that
ambassador
had
taken
this
oil
and
gas
lease
and
had
top
leased
the
other
oil
and
gas
lease.
and
that
caused
judge
rizley,
the
trial
judge,
the
district
judge
for
the
western
district,
one
of
our
judges,
considerable
concern
because
there's
--
there
were
several
complaints
filed.
i
think
this
is
a
third
amendment
complaint.
the
--
ambassador
was
accused
of
piracy
and
several
other
things
like
that.
so
--
and
it
--
it
did
concern
judge
rizley
quite
a
bit.
but
because
ambassador
took
the
lease,
they
didn't
go
to
domestic
and
say
here,
"we've
top
leased
your
lease,
we
want
the
release
of
your
lease.
we
just
took
our
lease
and
we
put
it
on
the
record."
and
--
and
under
advice
of
counsel,
that
--
that
lease
was
dead.
now,
that's
--
it
was
ambassador's
possession
on
it.
well
--
alright
we've
gotten
to
that
--
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes,
sir
and
informed
him
that
they
were
drilling.
so
at
that
point,
the
domestic
--
mr.
brook's,
domest
--
mr.
brook,
president
of
domestic
consulted
an
attorney
there
who
represented
the
domestic
oil
corporation
and
that
attorney
informed
this
mr.
don
stinchecum,
his
name
is
mentioned
in
the
opinion
written
by
judge
phillips
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
stinchecum
informed
mr.
brook
that
he
was
afraid
that
that
30-day
oil
and
gas
lease
was
dead
and
that
what
--
they
had
better
do
is
see
ambassador
and
make
the
best
deal
they
could
have
to
see
if
they
can
compromise
the
thing
out
in
some
way.
so
mr.
hurst
did
see
ambassador
and
ambassador
made
an
arrangement
with
domestic
where
under
ambassador
was
paid
a
cash
consideration
of
$2500
for
this
oil
and
gas
lease
that
ambassador
bought
for
$1800
and
reserved
an
additional
override
of
$2500,
i
believe.
my
figures
may
be
a
little
long.
i
think
that's
about
right
though
payable
of
a
--
of
a
--
most
of
the
working
interest,
so
that
ambassador
came
out
with
$5000.
now,
this
--
after
that
happened,
after
those
events
happened,
why
mr.
brook
caught
mr.
meeker
in
san
francisco
or
california
somewhere,
he
was
out
of
town
or
--
oh,
no
that
is
not
correct,
it
was
not
after
they
happened,
while
they
were
happening
or
after
--
after
mr.
stinchecum
had
advised
mr.
brook
or
domestic
that
they
should
obtain
the
ambassador
lease
if
possible.
why,
mr.
brook
testified
as
he
reach
mr.
meeker
in
california
and
talked
with
him
on
the
telephone
and
mr.
meeker
testified
to
this
too.
i
mean,
these
are
in
the
record
here,
these
facts.
talked
to
mr.
meeker
and
mr.
meeker
told
him
what
counsel
had
told
domestic
and
mr.
meeker
said,
"why,
just
ignore
that
lease,
go
ahead
and
drill
that
well.
ignore
that
lease.
pay
no
attention
to
their
claim."
but
domestic
chose
to
follow
the
advice
of
counsel
rather
than
the
advice
of
mr.
meeker,
so
that
domestic
took
an
assignment
as
they
did
here
with
ambassador
and
took
an
assignment
of
the
ambassador
lease,
and
that
was
a
compromise
or
a
settlement
in
behalf
of
everybody.
that's
what
the
--
the
trial
court
so
found
and
the
court
of
appeals
so
found
that
that
--
that
assignment
from
ambassador
to
domestic
was
in
settlement
of
the
entire
controversy.
now,
there
was
no
authority
on
the
part
of
domestic
to
settle
mr.
meeker's
interest.
now,
that's
admittedly
but
there
were
co-tenants
and
their
operating
agreement
was
not
put
in
evidence.
i
don't
know
whether
it
gave
him
authority
or
not
but
anyway,
that's
--
that
--
we'll
have
to
assume
that
there
was
no
authority
and
it
was
done
without
authority.
but
after
that
happened
--
after
they'd
made
a
deal
with
ambassador,
why
domestic
--
now,
they've
gotten
down
in
two
days
time
about
20
--
2000
some
odd
feet.
so,
there
was
in
this
well,
they
never
acquired
a
way
sir.
i
think
there's
a
well
that's
4800
or
--
depth,
the
depth,
i
think
that's
in
the
record
too.
so
they
had
commenced
the
well
that
is
believing
that
the
30-day
lease
was
valid
but
they
estopped
it
and
then
made
the
deal
uncompromised.
and
mr.
meeker,
as
i
said,
objected
to
that
kind
of
a
compromise
and
told
domestic
they
should
just
ignore
it.
well,
they
didn't
do
that
and
they
went
on
there
and
made
the
deal
with
ambassador
and
drill
the
well
on
down,
got
a
productive
well.
mr.
meeker
came
back
from
california,
was
informed
of
all
the
facts
and
decided
that
he
would
take
an
assignment
of
his
interest
in
the
ambassador
lease.
and
he
did
take
an
assignment
of
his
interest
in
the
ambassador
lease
and
he
was
still
contending
that
ambassador
had
robbed
domestic,
that
ambassador
was
a
bunch
of
crooks,
that
the
domestic
was
wrong
in
yielding
to
ambassador,
all
those
things.
he
testified
that
and
there
is
no
doubt
but
that's
what
he
believed.
and
in
the
assignment
which
he
took
from
domestic,
he
reserved
his
right
to
contest
the
--
the
ambassador
lease
and
a
right
to
contend
that
the
30-day
lease
was
the
valid
lease
rather
than
the
ambassador
lease.
that
--
that
assignment
is
--
that
really
--
important
portions
of
it
are
quoted
at
page
4
of
our
brief.
that
particular
assignment
also
contained
this
language.
this
assignment
is
subject
to
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
lease
assignment
from
ambassador
oil
corporation
to
domestic
oil
corporation,
recorded
in
book
390
at
page
592,
to
the
office
of
the
county
clerk
of
logan
--
logan
county,
okalahoma.
now
in
one
breath,
he
says,
"i
deny
the
ambassador
lease."
in
the
next
breath
he
says,
"i
take
this
assignment
subject
to
all
of
the
terms
and
provision
of
the
assignment
from
ambassador
to
domestic."
now,
the
assignment
from
ambassador
to
domestic
contained
this
provision.
and
your
honor,
this
is
the
reference
again
to
the
--
you
know,
you'd
rather
bear
in
mind
that
there
were
two
leases
and
contraposition
to
each
other,
the
30-day
lease
and
the
ambassador
lease,
i
think
that's
the
way
to
refer
to
them.
now,
the
assignment
of
the
ambassador
lease
contain
this
provision,
it's
quoted
at
page
4
of
our
brief,
"that
the
lease
hereby
assigned
is
the
effective
oil
and
gas
lease,
covering
the
land
here
and
above
described
and
that
the
lease
of
record",
now
that's
the
30-day
lease,
"under
which
assignee",
of
course
that's
domestic,
he
was
doing
the
drilling,
"commenced
drilling
operations,
has
terminated
and
is
no
longer
effective".
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
had
those
--
your
honor
please,
had
those
operations
then
continued
with
due
diligence,
they've
proceeded
and
drilled
a
well,
there
would
be
no
question
on
the
oklahoma
law.
but
that
those
operations
were
a
sufficient
commencement
of
operations
but
that
doesn't
have
to
actually
dig
into
the
ground
in
order
to
con
--
constitutes
commencement
of
operations.
and
commencement
of
operations
alone
is
sufficient
to
hold
of
the
lease,
so
that
they
could
have
domestic
and
meeker
and
the
other
working
interest
owners
could
have
under
that
30-day
lease
had
they
--
can
move
forward
with
diligence,
have
perpetuated
that
oil
and
gas
lease.
now,
the
excuse
that
they
put
up
for
not
doing
that
is
that
they
hadn't
commenced
that
well
and
sunray
--
some
representatives
of
sunray
oil
corporation
called
them
on
the
telephone
and
said,
"hey,
can
you
drill
on
that
well
on
a
10-acre
pattern?
we
don't
think
that's
wide
enough
spacing
in
there.
we're
going
to
apply
to
the
corporation
commission
for
40-acre
spacing
and
we
ought
not
to
drill
that
well
on
that
pattern."
now
that
was
there
excuse.
that
was
domestic's
excuse
for
withholding
operations.
but
both
judge
rizley
and
the
--
and
--
oh
and
subsequent
to
that
time,
the
sunray
did
file
for
40-acre
space
and
that
controls
where
your
wells
maybe
drilled
and
so
forth
as
the
court
knows.
subsequent
to
that
time,
why
the
sunray
did
file
for
spacing,
filed
a
spacing
application.
and
under
the
oklahoma
law,
after
there
is
an
application
for
spacing,
no
well
maybe
drilled
at
any
other
location
without
a
special
order
of
the
corporation
commission.
but
this
well
had
been
commenced
prior
by
the
bulldozer
work
had
been
commenced
prior
to
the
application
of
sunray
and
nothing
would
have
prevented
domestic
from
drilling
that.
there
is
no
--
at
that
recent
location
that
well
to
completion
had
they
chosen
to
do
so.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
without
--
without
this
--
without
the
slightest
doubt
and
judge
rizley
so
held.
he
held
--
of
the
--
that
there
had
been
commencement
of
drilling
operations
within
the
terms
of
the
oil
and
gas
lease
but
that
the
operations
had
not
been
pursued
with
due
diligence
and
therefore,
the
lease
had
terminated.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
that's
--
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
no,
no,
your
honor.
that's
not
the
only
crucial
fact.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes,
sir.
it
is
a
crucial
fact,
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
right,
sir.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
that's
correct.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
correct.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes,
sir,
correct.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
that's
--
that
--
yes,
sir,
that
is
one
of
them.
now,
there
was
another
element
in
there.
the
--
they
contended
that
mr.
hurst
testified
that
he
had
talked
to
mrs.
lowder,
hettie
lowder,
and
had
obtained
from
her
an
oral
extension
of
that
oil
and
gas
lease.
now,
that's
of
course
if
they
--
they
had
a
binding
and
valid
extension
of
the
oil
and
gas
lease,
well
then,
those
operations
could've
been
ceased
as
they
were
and
nothing
done.
but
--
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
no,
sir,
i
say
--
i
say,
had
they
had
a
binding
extension
of
the
lease,
they
would've
been
alright.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes
sir.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes,
sir.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that
at
all,
that
that
is
a
--
you
can't
just
go
out
and
make
an
oral
deal
and
--
on
--
and
--
and
extend
a
--
an
estate
and
land
that's
created
by
an
oil
and
gas
lease.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes,
its
one
of
them,
yes
sir
and
not
only,
there's
several
estoppel
points
or
not
only
that
he
accept
this
assignment
from
domestic
which
recites
that
it's
subject
to
all
the
terms
and
the
provision
of
the
assignment
from
ambassador
to
domestic,
but
he
also
signed
division
orders
and
accepted
--
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
sir?
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes,
sir.
that's
after
the
--
after
production
is
obtained
your
honor.
the
pipeline
companies
will
circulate
division
orders
which
specify
the
interest
of
the
various
parties
and
the
proceeds
of
the
oil.
and
the
--
mr.
meeker
admitted,
it's
in
the
record
here,
that
he
had
executed
division
orders
and
had
been
paid
and
--
under
the
ambassador
lease.
now
he
testified,
however,
"i
informed
champlin
refining
company,"
that's
the
company
that's
running
the
oil,
"that
i
reserve
my
rights
to
contest
the
--
this
matter."
but
--
i
--
i
--
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
no
--
yes,
your
honor,
i
say
he
could
not
do
that.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
it
was
--
it
was
--
the
actual
date
of
the
lease
that
was
taken
back
in
april,
it
was
anticipating
the
expiration.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
in
1958.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
on
april
the
30th,
1958,
herman
hurst
acquired
from
hettie
lower
--
lowder
this
30-day
oil
and
gas
lease
which
had
a
term
running
from
july
--
from
june
3rd,
1958
through
july
3rd
--
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
--1958.
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
that's
true.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
they
did
it
--
under
the
records,
undisputed,
they
--
a
day
or
two
days,
about
$60
worth
of
work,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
with
--
without
question.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
without
question.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
about
july
22nd,
the
date
they
acquired
the
lease
about
that
time.
i
don't
know
the
exact
date.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes,
sir.
about
20
days
after
the
work
had
occurred
or
20
or
more
or
less.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
no,
sir.
no
dispute
about
that.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
waiting
for
the
corporation
commission
to
enter
the
spacing
order
that
would
permit
the
drilling
of
the
well.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
that
--
that
was
their
position.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
yes,
but
in
that
connection,
they
also
contended
that
they
had
to
have
an
oral
extension
of
the
lease
from
hettie
lowder.
now,
hettie
lowder
had
a
lawyer
of
her
own
mr.
justice
black,
mr.
merle
smith,
who
is
a
prominent
lawyer
from
guthrie,
oklahoma.
this
lady
and
she
is
a
lady,
is
80
some
odd
years
old
but
sharp
as
a
tack
and
she
consulted
with
mr.
smith
about
this
matter
of
whether
or
not
this
30-day
lease
was
dead
or
not.
and
mr.
smith
advised
her
that
the
lease
was
dead
and
that
she
was
free
to
execute
the
oil
and
gas
lease.
and
only
after
talking
with
mr.
smith,
that
she
execute
the
oil
and
gas
lease
to
ambassador.
and
now
we've
got
tree
lawyers,
three
oklahoma
lawyers,
each
of
whom
gave
the
same
answer,
that's
before
the
fact,
i
am
an
associate
of
mine,
tell
ambassador
your
30-day
lease
is
dead.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
no,
no,
no
it
didn't
--
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
well,
only
--
only
to
this
extent
your
honor
please,
under
the
oklahoma
law,
advice
of
counsel
is
absolute
defense
to
a
claim
of
slander
of
title,
that's
on
the
oklahoma
law
of
--
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes,
sir,
yes
sir.
if
not
--
your
honor
please,
i'm
not
sure
judge
--
judge
phillips
characterized
this
action
with
the
slander
of
title
action.
i
don't
know
whether--
whether
it
was
a
slander
of
title
or
not.
if
you
have
--
i
have
--
i
have
both
the
--
his
analysis
of
it
in
my
brief,
i
talked
about
it
to
be
a
slander
of
title
but
i'm
not
sure
it's
that.
now,
here's
the
second
cause
of
action.
the
first
cause
of
action
in
this
case
was
to
plot
title,
pure
and
simply.
the
plaintiff
and
through
domestic
and
others
was
in
possession,
there's
no
question
of
possession
involved
in
this
action
at
all.
so
there's
no
action
of
ejectment
or
anything,
a
pure
plot
title
action
in
the
first
cause
of
action.
second
cause
of
action
says
this,
that
the
plaintiffs
re-plead
all
their
first
cause
of
action
that
ambassador
oil
corporation,
by
its
duly
authorized
officers
and
agents
and
by
merle
smith,
now
that's
mrs.
lowder's
attorney,
acted
in
no
ethical
or
legal
capacity,
willfully
and
maliciously
conspired
to
bring
about
and
did
bring
about
a
renunciation
breach
and
repudiation
by
hettie
e.
lowder
of
said
lease
to
herman
l.
hurst
under
which
through
said
assignments
from
said
herman
hurst,
these
plaintiffs
obtained
their
mineral
interest.
and
that
such
acts
of
said
defendant
were
for
the
purposes
of
depriving
these
plaintiffs
of
their
lawful
contract
rights
and
mineral
interest
and
for
a
wrongful,
monetary
benefit
to
themselves.
that
ambassador
oil
corporation,
merle
smith,
and
hettie
e.
lowder,
knowingly
conspired
and
did
the
aforesaid
acts
for
the
purpose
of
depriving
these
plaintiffs
of
their
lawful
mineral
interest
and
thereby
maliciously
and
unlawfully
liable
and
slandered
the
said
1/16th
overriding
royalty
owned
by
the
plaintiffs.
now,
under
--
now,
in
this
original
action,
merle
smith
was
made
a
party.
ambassador
was
a
party.
hettie
lowder
was
a
party.
now
before
the
case
was
tried,
it
was
dismissed
by
the
plaintiffs
insofar
as
merle
smith
was
concerned.
that
gets
rid
one
of
the
conspirators.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
evidence,
ambassador
moved
for
judgment
and
so
did
hettie
lowder.
judge
rizley
sustained
the
motion
insofar
as
hettie
lowder
was
concerned
held
that
they've
proved
no
case
against
her
and
let
her
out.
the
--
and
that
juries
have
held
ambassador
in,
till
all
the
testimony
was
in.
in
other
words,
he
refused
to
sustain
our
demurrer
of
the
evidence
at
the
conclusion
of
the
plaintiffs'
case.
but
he
did
sustain
it
as
to
hettie
lowder.
now,
that
gets
rid
of
the
second
conspirator.
it
leaves
ambassador.
now,
he
alleges
conspiracy.
i
--
i
--
i
really
don't
know
whether
this
--
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
well,
i
--
i
really
don't
know
whether
--
whether
this
is
a
slander
of
title
action
or
not.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes,
yes
sir.
yes
sir.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
perhaps
not
but
they
--
if
--
of
course
he
alleges
conspiracy,
he
didn't
allege
the
--
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes,
they're
could
be,
yes
indeed.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes,
it
would.
that'd
be
a
tort
would
it
not
and
so
i
think
it
would.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes,
sir
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
i
understand
that
sir.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
right.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
that's
correct.
and
--
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes,
sir.
we've
--
our
revered
dean
of
our
law
school
here,
dean
(inaudible)
say,
"you
can't
blow
hot
and
cold",
your
honor
and
that
--
i
think
that's
the
point
here.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
one
source,
his
claim.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
no,
sir,
the
third
--
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
that's
all.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
oh,
yes,
i
--
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
yes,
sir.
i
think
he
was
estopped
by
deed,
he
was
estopped
by
this
acceptance.
i
think
he
was
--
that
the
lease
had
expired
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
--
that
period
of
time
has
gone
by,
i
think
the
court
should've
said
that
lease
is
dead
and
that
--
there
--
and
there
--
or
there
couldn't
be
no
claim
of
malice
in
due
of
the
fact
that
counsel
advised
the
ambassador
that
lease
is
dead.
mr.
c.
harold
thweatt
perhaps
on
the
second
cause
of
action,
your
honor
please,
i
think
the
beacon
case
is
a
--
a
very
violent
turn.
i
think
the
beacon
--
as
explained
by
the
dairy
queen
case,
i
think
the
effect
of
the
beacon
case
and
the
dairy
queen
case
would
mean
that
--
that
there
is
no
more
--
there
are
no
more
suits
in
equity
which
i
don't
think
was
the
intention
of
the
--
when
the
federal
rules
were
adopted.
and
i
--
i
think
it
would
--
anytime
that
they're
issued
--
there,
you
can
take
several
--
you
could
either
terminate
by
the
basic
nature
of
the
action
which
the
court
has
apparently
rejected
in
the
beacon
case.
or
you
could
say
that
wherever
there
is
a
jury
issue,
while
that
jury
issue
will
be
tried
by
the
case
or
you
can
say
what
the
court
seemingly
said
as
explained
in
your
honor's
opinion
in
the
dairy
queen
case,
what
they
said
in
the
beacon
case.
and
you
cite
the
thermo-stitch
case
from
the
florida
circuit
that
says,
"that
anytime
there
is
a
jury
issue,
then
the
entire
case
must
be
tried
to
the
jury."
we
don't
--
that's
the
law,
of
course,
we'll
have
to
abide
with
it.
but
we
respectfully
submit
that
such
a
rule
abolishes
equity
jurisdiction.
we
don't
think
that
that
was
the
intention
of
the
rule
but
of
course
this
court
--
they
call
the
signals.
