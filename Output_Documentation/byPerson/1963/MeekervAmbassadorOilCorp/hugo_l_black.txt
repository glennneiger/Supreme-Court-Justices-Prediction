justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
crucial
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
of
fact?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
a
crucial
fact?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
see
if
i
can
clearly
understand
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
they
had
a
30-day
lease?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
lease
had
rights
which
would've
extended
far
more
than
30
days,
unless
i'm
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
began
work
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
pursued
it
with
due
diligence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
if
they
did
begin
work
again
and
pursue
it
with
due
diligence,
the
fact-finder
determined
that
to
be
true,
then
domestic
owned
the
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
is
the
crucial
question
of
fact
in
which
they
insist
they
were
entitled
the
right
to
trial
by
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
he
couldn't
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you?
i
--
i
didn't
quite
get
these
dates
where
--
what
was
the
date
of
the
30-day
lease?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
--
what
was
the
date
of
the
30-day
lease
and
what
date
it
is
included?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright,
now
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
--
it's
getting
clear
in
my
mind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
during
that
period,
they
went
in
with
their
bulldozers
to
do
work
on
the
land?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
how
long
do
you
say
they
did
that
work?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
the
proper
kind
of
work
to
do
to
start
on
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
their
operations?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
date
did
ambassador
go
over
and
look
at
the
land
and
conclude
that
they'd
abandoned
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
july
22nd?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
dispute
although
whether
they
were
--
there
was
some
of
the
tools
of
the
domestic
people
that
are
still
there
on
the
land?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
they
claim
that
they
were
doing
at
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
they
had
gotten
it
ready
to
drill
the
well
but
they
couldn't
do
it
because
they
didn't
have
an
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
while
that
was
pending
in
there,
ambassador
went
over
and
got
another
lease
for
itself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
not
conclusive
on
the
court,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
one
of
the
two
prongs
of
the
action?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
want
to
ask
you
one
more
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
be,
our
top
--
main
problem
is
a
question
of
the
right
to
trial
by
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it
that
your
argument
that
you've
made,
they
--
on
this
premise,
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
this
court
could
determine
that
this
man
meeker
was
estopped
to
challenge
your
title?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
should
determine
that
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
despite
the
fact
that
every
paper
he
signed
and
every
word
he
uttered
according
to
what
you've
said,
was
protesting
that
your
lease
was
no
good
and
it
should
--
mistreated
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
was
--
he
was
blowing
very
hot
each
time,
wasn't
he
(inaudible)
what
your
company
had
done
to
him,
his
interest.
what
you're
saying
is
that
all
--
because
he
had
a
source
of
title
in
two
--
his
claim
rested
on
two
sources.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
claimed
two
sources,
didn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
claimed
the
source
of
title,
the
30-day
lease.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
30-day
lease
and
you
were
saying
are
you
not,
that
he
also
claimed
on
the
ambassador's
title?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
you
say
that
since
he
was
claiming
on
the
ambassador's
title
too,
taken
two
prongs
to
a
lawsuit
which
people
in
fact
frequently
do,
that
he
was
thereby
estopped
from
making
any
claim
on
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
outside
of
that,
do
you
agree
or
deny
that
under
the
beacon
case,
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
jury
but
were
you
alleged
to
estoppel?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
depend
to
some
extent
on
the
position
they
took
after
the
oral
extension?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
here
as
i
gather
it
is
that
whatever
the
record
may
show
as
to
the
fact
that
we've
been
asking
you
about,
they
were
facts
on
which
your
right
to
show
that
you
proceeded
with
due
diligence
with
what
crucial
in
your
case,
you're
entitled
to
have
them
tried
by
jury
and
neither
by
the
federal
court
below
and
now
by
this
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
law
would
we
have
to
defend
on
to
determine
whether
there's
an
estoppel?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
rather
complicated
feel
as
it
may,
isn't
it?
i
found
oklahoma
law
sometimes
rather
complicated
even
when
it
didn't
involve
a
estoppel.
