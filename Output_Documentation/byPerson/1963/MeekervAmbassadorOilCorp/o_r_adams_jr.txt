mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
this
honorable
court.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
charles
a.
and
sybil
meeker
were
plaintiffs
in
the
trial
court
and
the
respondent,
ambassador
oil
corporation
was
a
defendant
there.
this
was
a
diversity
of
citizenship
case
about
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
oklahoma.
the
--
there
are
two
questions
here
before
this
court
today.
one
is
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
was
wrongfully
denied
a
trial
by
jury
in
the
district
court
and
two,
whether
or
not
the
petitioners
were
stopped
to
contest
the
claim
of
ambassador
oil
corporation
to
the
leasehold
interest
involved
here.
now,
mr.
meeker
and
his
associates
have
a
30-day
oil
and
gas
lease
on
this
property
involved,
what
was
--
which
was
to
expire
in
its
primary
term.
on
june
third
1958
by
two
conveyances,
the
petitioner's
claim
of
33/128th
working
that
was
done
in
this
lease
at
1/16th
overriding
royalty.
now,
shortly
prior
to
june
the
3rd,
1958,
the
meeker
group
commits
drilling
operations
under
this
lease
which
continued
the
primary
term
of
this
lease
unless
they
failed
to
carry
through
these
drilling
operations
with
due
diligence.
shortly
after
the
work
was
commenced
on
this
lease,
a
dispute
arose
with
sunray
oil
company.
sunray
had
adjoining
acreage
to
this
lease
and
sunray
wanted
a
larger
spacing
than
had
been
started
by
the
petitioners.
and
when
this
dispute
arose,
the
petitioners
discontinued
their
drilling
operations
except
for
some
more
preliminary
work
in
august
of
1958
until
september
the
2nd,
1958,
at
which
time
the
oklahoma
corporation
commission
made
a
spacing
order
on
this
property.
and
as
soon
as
this
spacing
order
was
made,
they
again
fired
up
and
they
spotted
the
oil
and
eventually
bought
in
a
producer
on
this
property.
and
the
meantime,
you
see
the
lease
would
have
expired
on
june
the
3rd,
but
they
did
commence
their
drilling
so
that
extent
to
the
primary
term.
in
the
meantime,
on
july
the
22nd,
ambassador
oil
corporation,
they
responded
in
this
case,
obtained
another
lease
on
this
same
property.
on
july
the
22nd,
ambassador
obtained
another
lease.
and
when
they
got
this
lease,
when
they
went
over
and
talked
to
mrs.
lowder
out
of
another
lease
on
the
same
property,
they
knew
a
number
of
things,
they
knew
that
the
petitioners'
lease
was
a
record.
they
knew
that
drilling
operations
have
been
commenced
on
this
drill
site.
they
were
told
by
mrs.
lowder,
“my
lease
is
tied
up.”
they
knew
also
that
the
meeker
group
on
the
adjoining
acreage
had
brought
in
the
exploratory
well
in
this
area.
as
a
producer,
which
made
all
of
this
property
light,
well
after
the
meeker
group
again
started
up,
when
the
spacing
order
was
made
by
the
oklahoma
corporation
commission
and
after
they
had
this
well
drilled,
one-third
down,
then
ambassador
oil
corporation
called
up
and
thanked
this
group
for
drilling
on
their
lease.
they
have
been
taken
the
trouble
to
get
releases.
they
knew
all
these
things
existed
but
they
didn't
get
releases
and
after
all
this
commenced,
after
they
saw,
they
must
speak
up.
they
thanked
the
people
for
drilling
on
their
lease.
now,
after
the
meeker
--
the
driller
on
this
well
first
turn
about
the
respondent's
claim,
he
started
trying
to
get
hold
of
mr.
meeker.
the
driller
started
trying
to
get
hold
of
mr.
meeker.
he
couldn't
find
mr.
meeker.
he
then
got
a
mr.
herman
hurst
to
look
into
the
matter
and
mr.
hurst
and
the
driller
and
of
course
it
didn't
make
much
difference
to
the
driller
because
all
he
had
was
a
working
interest,
but
they
decided,
“well,
we
had
better
make
a
compromise.”
they
did
make
a
compromise,
but
mr.
meeker
didn't
make
any
compromise
and
he
never
agreed
to
any
compromise
and
why
because
although
this
purported
compromise
would
allow
the
working
interest
holders
including
the
driller
to
the
end
up
with
substantially
the
same
interest,
it
would
not
allow
the
petitioners
to
end
up
with
that
same
interest.
because
under
the
lease
which
we
claim
here
today
is
the
valid
lease
on
this
property,
the
petitioner
have
substantially
the
same
working
interest,
except,
except
that
this
working
interest
would
not
have
been
burdened
with
the
$2500
oil
from
the
ambassador
oil
corporation
and
except
that
the
petitioners
would
have
a
1/16th
override
and
that's
what
we're
here
about
today.
the
1/16th
override
and
doing
away
with
that
oil
payment.
now
if
the
ambassador
lease
or
considered
to
follow
that
lease,
the
ambassador
oil
corporation
would
have
a
3/32nd
override
burdening
this
lease
and
the
working
interest
worst
that
it
was
before,
they
would
have
a
$2500
oil
payment
and
meeker's
would
not
have
the
override.
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
mr.
justice
--
justice
brennan,
we
have
two
issues
here
before
us.
one
is
the
denial
of
the
jury
trial.
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
two,
is
whether
or
not
meeker's
were
stopped
to
the
--
to
contest
ambassador
oil
corporation's
claim.
and
this
second
issue
or
well,
it
isn't
as
important
for
the
country
as
the
first,
is
an
important
issue.
it's
a
vital
to
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
the
argument
will
be
made
that
if
the
right
on
the
second
issue,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
we
were
wrongfully
denied
at
jury
trial
or
not
because
we
had
nothing
to
go
to
the
jury.
also,
if
we
were
allowed
a
jury
trial
and
it
were
decided
that
they
were
right
in
their
second
contention
here,
we
might
as
well
--
insofar
as
the
petitioners
are
concerned,
we
might
as
well
not
be
here
anyway
because
we
could
not
possibly
went
it
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
well
your
honor,
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
court
is
somewhat
easier
to
the
--
determine
than
the
conclusion
of
the
tenth
circuit.
now,
the
trial
court
mentioned
the
date
in
arriving
at
the
estoppel.
the
tenth
circuit
felt
that
the
petitioners
had
ratified
the
ambassador
lease
although
it's
hard
to
determine
just
why
they
thought
so,
whether
it
was
based
on
the
deed
for
taking
--
or
taking
--
working
interest
payments
under
the
second
deed
and
that
gets
me
to
the
point
of
the
estoppel.
you
see,
meeker's
claimed
under
mrs.
lowder,
the
widow
lady
who
had
owned
a
--
owned
the
surface
here.
and
meeker's
claimed
under
mrs.
lowder
under
a
lease,
their
lease
was
directed
from
her.
alright
then
later
after
they
brought
in
this
robinson
well
and
while
they
were
waiting
for
corporation
commission,
ambassador
came
in
and
got
this
other
lease
from
mrs.
lowder.
then
when
--
when
the
driller
decided
they'd
better
compromise
although
meeker
at
all
times
disagree
to
this,
meeker
to
protect
his
working
interest,
then
accepted
quitclaim
for
the
--
from
the
driller
for
that
part
for
his
working
interest.
but
of
course,
in
that
deed
itself
--
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
--
in
that
of
deed
itself,
he
said,
“i
reserve
my
right
to
contest
the
validity
of
the
ambassador
lease.”
now
on
that
point
of
the
estoppel,
while
we're
talking
about
it,
had
he
not
put
that
in
the
matter?
had
he
not
put
that
reservation
in
there
at
all?
we
say
that
there
are
three
oklahoma
cases
that
disposed
of
that
issue,
squared
and
conclusively
in
favor
of
the
petitioners
and
--
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
your
honor,
oh
that's
hard
to
say.
it
seems
that
a
good
part
thereon.
frankly,
it
appears
to
me
that
a
good
part
of
this
law
on
this
has
rather
been
ignored
as
to
facing
the
issues
on
its
square
but
--
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
well,
nevertheless
your
honor,
we
do
have
this
point
before
us
and
it
is
vital
in
this
case
we
feel.
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
it
would
appear
to
me
that
if
the
--
it's
a
hard
question
of
mr.
justice
(voice
overlap)
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
that
would
be
the
basis
of
the
estoppel
mr.
justice
white.
it
would
be
and
it
is
tied
in
with
the
determination
that
we've
had.
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
but
--
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
yes,
now
--
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
they
would
have
been.
and
the
tenth
circuit
recognized
this
and
the
tenth
circuit
said,
“we
recognize
that
you
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
on
your
second
cause
of
action
which
was
a
slander
of
title
action.”
but
they
said,
“the
court
in
determining
title
in
your
first
cause
of
action
makes
the
question
loop.”
now,
that's
in
effect
what
they
say
and
in
that
part
of
this
action,
that
is
what
we're
complaining
about
today
that
that
statement
of
the
court
is
directly
contrary
to
the
beacon
theatres
case,
which
states
that
you
cannot
--
that
trial
court
cannot
choose
to
determine
the
equitable
issues
first
and
thereby,
make
the
legal
issues
res
judicata.
now,
on
that
point,
in
our
first
cause
of
action,
we
--
we
say
that
on
our
--
that
in
our
first
cause
of
action
itself
in
however,
we
were
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
the
reason
we
say
that
we
were
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
in
the
first
cause
of
action,
is
first,
if
it
were
for
determination
of
title
alone,
if
it
were
for
determination
of
title
alone,
this
court
has
noted
that
the
declare
--
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
has
expanded
legal
remedies
to
the
extent
that
it
may
not
be
necessary,
that
we'll
need
to
see
whether
it
is
necessary
to
have
an
equitable
action
now.
and
we
say
your
honor
that
it
isn't
today
unnecessary
to
have
this
equitable
action.
now,
i
think
that
our
complaint
in
this
case
shows
that.
we
didn't
say
in
the
old
plank
titled
manner,
that
someone
is
bothering
us
in
our
peace
and
enjoyment
of
our
property
and
you
won't
--
and
we
want
you
to
enjoin
them,
we
want
an
injunction.
we
said
that
we
have
legal
title
to
our
property
and
we
want
the
court
to
determine
that
we
have
legal
title.
and
that
the
court
can
and
should
have
done
that
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act
and
thereby,
allowing
us
trial
to
the
--
by
jury
on
that
point,
if
had
been
there
all
by
itself.
in
addition,
we
ask
for
an
accounting
on
these
oral
royalties
in
our
first
cause
of
action.
and
we
submit
that
the
dairy
queen
case
says,
“that
unless,
this
accounting
is
so
complicated,
that
it
could
not
possibly
be
unraveled
by
the
jury
that
therein
our
first
cause
of
action
when
we
are
entitled
to
the
jury.”
then
when
we
get
to
this
second
cause
of
action,
a
pure
and
plain
toward
action
by
which
besides
our
special
damages
for
keeping
us
from
getting
our
royalties,
we
intended
to
get
punitive
damages.
a
court
action
based
on
one
interference
with
contact
rights
to
slander
of
title
or
interference
with
contract
rights
was
based
on
ambassador
oil
corporation
coming
in
and
talking
on
mrs.
lowder
into
giving
them
another
lease
when
she
told
them,
“our
land
is
tied
up.”
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
prefer
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
ways
to
deny
a
jury
trial
in
a
civil
case.
one
of
them
is
to
classify
the
action
as
equitable
and
say
you're
not
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
the
other
way
is
to
pick
out
some
undisputed
fact
in
the
case
and
say,
"mr.
plaintiff
as
a
matter
of
the
law,
you
don't
have
any
cause
of
action
to
go
to
the
jury."
this
can
be
worked
separately
or
together
but
either
is
just
as
effective
as
the
other.
now,
is
this
court
going
to
say
to
that
we
will
protect
your
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
the
one
instance,
but
that
if
you'll
pick
out
some
fact
here.
if
you'll
pick
out
some
fact
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
you
apply
the
law,
the
substantive
law
of
the
state
right
or
wrong,
even
though
you're
quite
wrong,
all
you
have
to
do
is
say
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case
you
have
no
cause
to
the
--
go
to
the
jury.
and
whether
the
trial
court
applies
the
law
correctly
or
incorrectly,
that
does
away
with
the
case.
i
think
this
court
will
not
say
that
because
that
would
open
the
way
clearly
and
obviously
to
a
way
to
effectively
deny
the
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial.
now
--
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
mr.
justice
goldberg,
they
didn't
just
bulldoze
the
land.
i
think
the
record
will
show
and
the
trial
court
itself
held
that
they
dug
a
circulating
pit
and
they
made
a
road.
and
as
mr.
thweatt
himself
has
said
here
today,
they
commenced
the
drilling
operation
but
if
continued
with
due
diligence,
gave
them
title
to
the
property
as
long
as
oil
was
produced.
now,
--
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
will
and
there's
one
thing
i
would
like
to
say
here
that
mr.
thweatt
has
made
this
argument
on
the
facts
and
he
has
stated
the
facts
in
such
a
way
they're
favorable
to
him.
and
i
will
also
submit
that
a
reading
of
the
record
before
this
court
will
not
even
establish
all
of
his
facts
if
they
put
them
all
of
his
way.
but
now
along
that
line,
this
lease
would
have
expired
had
the
well
not
been
commenced
on
july
the
3rd.
before
that
time,
they
commenced
the
drilling
operation.
right
at
this
time,
this
dispute
with
sunray
oil
company
arose
on
drilling.
and
there
was
a
question
of
fact,
as
to
whether
they
acted
with
due
diligence.
two
experts
testified.
mr.
meeker
and
mr.
hurst
then
said
it
would
have
been
unreasonable
in
the
light
of
this
dispute
to
continue
with
the
drilling
operation.
well,
they
waited
the
record
before
this
court
will
show
that
there
is
testimony
to
the
effect
that
the
corporation
commission
of
oklahoma
was
on
vacation.
as
soon
was
the
spacing
order
was
made,
they
fired
up
again.
they
had
their
equipment
there
all
the
time.
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
oh,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i'm
not
sure
whether
the
record
before
this
court
will
show
it
or
not.
i
think
that
the
record
--
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
correct.
i
--
i
think
that
the
record
below
would
have
shown
it.
but
now
as
i
say
it,
on
the
record
before
this
court,
you
will
not
find
all
of
these
facts
alleged
by
counsel.
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
i
believe
that
would
be,
yes,
sir.
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
record
affirmatively
shows
that
without
question.
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
have
to
be
concluded
from
the
record
also.
ambassador
knew
about
our
lease.
it
was
of
record.
they
knew
that
meeker's
earnings
--
meeker
and
his
associates
had
brought
in
the
robinson
well
on
adjoining
acreage
that
this
was
valuable
property.
they
knew
that
he
wasn't
going
to
turn
loose
of
this
lease
and
the
--
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
i
think
your
honor
that
this
record
would
show
that
it
may
or
may
not.
there
is
testimony
to
the
--
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
--
effect
that
it
would.
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
the
--
the
testimony
in
this
case
is
that
since
the
dispute
had
arisen
that
if
it
had
been
continued
in
the
face
of
the
dispute,
there
could've
been
a
penalty.
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
now,
one
of
the
thing
about
this
oral
extension,
we
certainly
take
issue
for
the
possession
of
the
respondent
that
an
oral
extension
on
this
prospect
cannot
be
binding.
now,
the
very
case
that
counsel
cites
for
this
proposition
goes
on
to
say
and
it
isn't
on
this
type
of
case
but
it
is
on
work
done.
it
goes
on
to
say
however,
if
he
showed
that
the
work
was
done,
well
then
you're
entitled
to
recover
on
quantum
merit
for
the
work.
now,
that
isn't
this
situation.
we
don't
think
it
supports
the
situation
at
all.
we
think
it
is
elementary.
under
the
law
of
the
statute
of
frauds,
that
you
can
even
buy
any
kind
of
real
property
by
an
oral
extension,
if
you
then
rely
on
it
and
sufficiently
change
your
position.
and
we
submit
that
in
addition
to
the
question
in
fact
of
due
diligence,
we
had
a
question
of
fact
of
an
oral
extension
and
whether
or
not
there
was
sufficient
reliance
to
remove
it
from
the
statute
of
fraud.
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
our
--
our
position
on
that
your
honor
is
that
in
--
reliance
on
the
oral
extension,
although
they
had
thought
they
didn't
need
it,
they
still
had
it.
they
went
ahead
and
they
moved
in
and
they
started
drilling
the
well
and
they
drilled
a
third
down
before
anyone
told
them
about
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
that's
right
your
honor.
and
in
addition
to
that,
i
don't
have
time
to
go
into
these
cases
but
only
a
estoppel
by
deed,
there
are
three
oklahoma
cases
that
are
squarely
in
line
which
disposed
of
the
respondents'
argument
on
an
estoppel
by
deed
even
if
we
hadn't
have
had
that
reservation.
but
we
had
the
reservation.
we
could've
contested
it
anyway
because
we
made
our
contest
under
--
on
another
deed
not
the
one
with
anything
about
ambassador
corporation
in
it.
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
oklahoma
law,
but
again
your
honor
i
--
i
say
--
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
nevertheless
your
honor,
we
submit
that
it
wouldn't
be
one
way
to
get
rid
of
our
right
to
a
jury
trial
to
pick
out
this
complicated
field,
construed
the
law
wrong
and
say,
"mr.
plaintiff,
you
had
no
cause
of
action
to
take
to
the
jury
in
the
first
place."
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
i
would.
i
think
that
--
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
first
counsel
ignores
everything
but
the
quiet
title.
he
ignores
our
accounting.
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
i
think
that
under
the
beacon
theatre's
case,
we
are
not
asking
for
an
injunction.
we
did
not
(inaudible)
action,
the
quiet
title
part
under
the
old
terms
by
saying,
someone's
bothering
us
in
our
quiet
possession
of
our
property
and
we
want
an
injunction
against
them.
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
feel
that
the
oklahoma
cases
will
be
controlling
here.
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
only
in
slander
of
title.
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
no,
i
--
but
on
the
other
hand,
your
honor
i
feel
--
mr.
o.
r.
adams,
jr.
i
feel
that
the
beacon
theatre
case
does
because
it
says
that
the
legal
remedies
have
been
expanded
by
the
declaratory
judgment
act
and
we
have
to
take
a
new
look
at
this
need
for
a
quiet
title
action.
and
if
we
don't
need
it,
if
it
isn't
necessary,
it
isn't
available.
and
that's
all
we
ask
in
this
case
that
the
title
to
our
property
be
--
to
this
property,
be
declared
in
the
plaintiff.
we
didn't
ask
that
anyone
be
enjoined
in
any
part
of
the
action.
may
i
say
that
i
wish
to
thank
you
for
your
kind
attention
and
indulgence
in
this
case
and
it
was
certainly
an
honor
to
have
the
opportunity
to
appear
before
you.
