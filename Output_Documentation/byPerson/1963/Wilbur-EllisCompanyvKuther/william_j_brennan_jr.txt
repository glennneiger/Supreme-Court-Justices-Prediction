it
would
be
in
the
patents.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
been
litigated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
they
purchased
directly
from
the
respondent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
any
restrictions
on
the
right
to
purchase
or
sale
of
those
machines?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course
it
wasn't
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)you
had
a
patent
that
entitled
you
to
cover
both
1-pound
machines
and
lesser
sized
machines.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
count.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
had
a
perfect
right
to
keep
that
machine
off
the
market
if
you
want
to
do
entirely.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
chose
to
build
it
as
a
1-pound
machine
and
thereby,
in
effect,
exclude
from
the
market
a
lesser
machine.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you're
arguing
is,
as
i
get
it,
that
when
the
purchaser
wanted
your
machines,
builds
and
puts
in
working
condition
the
1-pound
machine,
he
is,
in
effect,
preparing
it
to
put
it
into
condition
but
when
he's
doing
the
same
amount
of
work
to
do
--
to
build
a
new
kind
of
a
machine,
he's
reconstructing
the
machine.
isn't
that
what
you're
arguing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
same
amount
of
work
is
involved
with
the
operation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
taking
what
my
brother
stewart
suggested
to
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
your
argument?
