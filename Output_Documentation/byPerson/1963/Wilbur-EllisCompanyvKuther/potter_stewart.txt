for

justice

mr.
kuther
received
the
royalty
from
whom,
the
manufacturer
of
the
machine?
justice
potter
stewart
not
from
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
not
from
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
not
directly
from
the
purchaser.
justice
potter

it
paid
him
$1,500.
justice
potter

and
that
was
just
one
flat
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
payment
and
that
was
the
answer
for
each
machine.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought,
in
answer
to
mr.
goldberg's
question,
you
had
conceded
that
the--
that
a
5-ounce
machine
would
be
covered
by
mr.
kuther's
patent,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
it,
therefore,
was
embraced
in
his
discovery.
justice
potter
stewart
this
appellant.
justice
potter
stewart
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
much
disagreement
between
you
on
the
law
or,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
where
you
disagree
is
whether
as
--
where
this
was
reconstruction
or
repairing.
justice
potter
stewart
the
district
court
found,
as
a
fact,
that
it
was
--
was
reconstruction
and
not
repair.
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
it
was
his
understanding
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
really
direct
itself
to
that
question.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know
you
disagree
with
the
conclusion
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
so,
too,
and
i
wondered
what
you
thought
the
judge
merrill
had
in
mind
when
he
made
that
statement.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
moore,
when
these
machines
were
purchased,
at
least
three
of
them,
they
were
in
very
bad
shape.
they
were
inoperable,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
--
instead
of
--
and
they
would've
--
they
have
to
be
rebuilt
and
parts
replaced
in
order
to
be
put
in
working
operation
at
all.
what
if
they
had
been
--
if
those
--
what
was
necessary
to
do
had
been
done
to
restore
them
to
operating
as
a
1-pound
packing
machines.
would
you
have
the
same
claims?
would
have
this
--
would
you
also
have
a
case?
justice
potter
stewart
you
did
argue
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
because
it
seems
to
me
that,
logically,
your
argument
here
would
embrace
the
hypothetical
case.
justice
potter
stewart
both
are
covered,
both
the
5-ounce
and
the
1-pound
packing
machines
are
covered
by
the
basic
patent.
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
and
your
opponent
agree
on
that.
justice
potter
stewart
and,
the
same
amount
of
work,
as
i
understand
it,
substantially
the
same
amount
and
character
and
quality
of
work
would've
had
to
be
done
on
these
machines
in
order
to
restore
them
to
1-pound
packing
machine,
as
was
in
fact
done
to
re
--
to
convert
them
to
5-ounce
packing
machines.
isn't
that
right,
because
of
their
very
bad
condition
at
the
time
they
were
purchased?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
maybe
even
less
replacement
would've
been
--
was
done
and
would've
had
to
be
done
to
restore
them
to
1-pound
packing
machines,
wasn't
that
right?
because
the
plungers
were
so
corroded
and
rusted
that
they
--
this
way,
they
were
made
smaller
and
could
be
used
for
5-ounce
packing
machines.
but,
to
restore
them
to
1-pound
packing
machines,
they
would
have
had
to
be
discarded
and
completely
replaced.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
they
used
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
so,
they
did
use
and
could
use
the
original
plungers
here
but,
to
restore
them
to
1-pound
packing
--
to
a
1-pound
machine,
then
they
would
have
had
to
be
completely
replaced,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
maybe
more
work
would
have
had
to
be
done
to
restore
them
to
1-pound
packing
machines.
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
think
your
argument
would
embrace
--
would
necessarily
embrace
that.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
assume
that
both
kinds
are
fully
covered
by
the
patent
claims,
as
both
you
and
your
opponent
agree.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
probably
the
same
question,
assuming
the
manufacturer's
assumption
is
right,
that
is
--
that,
at
least,
as
much
labor
and
replacement
and
repair
and
reconstruction
would
have
had
to
take
--
taken
place
to
restore
them
to
the
--
to
their
original
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
function.
