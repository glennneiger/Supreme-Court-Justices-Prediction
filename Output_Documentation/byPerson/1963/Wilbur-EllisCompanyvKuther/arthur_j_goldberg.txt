mr.
neal,
do
you
(inaudible),
as
it
doesn't
add
to
your
machine,
when
you
filed
an
application
for
a
patent
and
your
opponents
did
not
accept
or
you
could
not
get
it
and
it's
covered
by
the
statute
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
as
we
do
here.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and,
i
take
it,
that
nobody
else
would
get
a
patent
in
this
position
to
apply
it
on
the
machine.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
in
other
words,
the
mark
of
the
argument
here,
that
being
so,
is
that
they
do
have
royalty
implied
by
these
machines.
is
that
correct,
one
for
the
original
machine
and
one
for
the
debt?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
moore,
is
there
a
case
that
believe
that
this
was
not
been
after
(inaudible)
and,
for
instance,
the
machine,
other
than
that,
had
some
mirror,
too.
beyond
that
machine,
there
were
variations,
which
you
have
here.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
so,
i
refuse
to
produce
a
similar
machine
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
purpose
of
the
patent
(inaudible)
but
the
way
of
packing
sardines
in
the
way
they're
patented,
as
you
claim.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
your
(inaudible)
is
to
claim
canning
sardines
and
that's
all
you've
got
in
the
scope.
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
just
to
compare
that
adaptation
enacted.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
it
seems
to
me
that
your
conception
itself
and
how
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
this
isn't
different
from
5-pound
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.

these
are
the
facts?
