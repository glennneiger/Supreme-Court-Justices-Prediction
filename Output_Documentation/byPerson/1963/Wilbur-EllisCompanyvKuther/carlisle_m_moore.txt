mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
knob
of
our
case
is
that
the
petitioners
here
have
made
additional
unauthorized
exploitation
of
respondent's
patent
without
any
obligation
to
respondent
for
this
increased
exploitation.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
quite
simple
and
authority
had
been
stated
in
some
detail.
as
far
as
the
patent
is
concerned,
i
again
want
to
emphasize
that
it
does
cover
a
1-pound
machine
or
a
one
--
or
a
5-ounce
machine
or
any
other
sized
can
machine
that
acts
in
the
way
described
in
the
patent.
it's
the
same
as
in
the
aro
case
wherein
the
claims
weren't
limited
to
chevrolet's
or
to
ford
cars
or
any
other
specific
cars.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
we're
in
agreement
on
that.
now,
what
happened
here
originally
was
that
respondent
or
rather
respondent's
licensee,
i
--
if
i
may,
i
will
refer
to
them
both
as
respondent
because
they're
essentially
the
same
person.
they
made
four
1-poundmachines.
that's
all
these
machines
could
do,
was
pack
1-pound
cans.
they're
in
no
way
adjustable.
it
could
pack
no
other
sized
can.
these
machines
were
bought.
the
purchase
price
for
the
machines
of
course
would
include
two
elements.
they
would
include
the
sale
of
the
physical
machine
and
then
they
would
include
the
royalty
for
the
use
of
these
machines
to
practice
respondent's
invention.
now,
the
patent
rights
which
passed
by
the
sale
of
a
machine
are
well
defined
by
this
court.
first
of
all,
a
sale
of
a
patented
machine
does
not
convey
all
the
rights
of
a
patentee
that
he
has.
the
rights
are
specific
to
the
particular
machine
that
is
sold.
the
buyer
of
the
machine
gets
the
right
to
use
that
machine
to
practice
the
invention
for
as
long
as
the
machine
is
operable.
if
the
machine
needs
repair,
the
owner
may
repair
it.
that's
clear
from
the
aro
case.
however,
if
the
machine
is
destroyed,
again
as
from
the
aro
case,
the
license
which
ran
with
the
machine
comes
to
an
end.
the
purchase
of
a
machine
does
not
give
the
purchaser
the
right
to
make
a
second
machine.that,
i
believe,
too,
is
clear
from
the
aro
case.
now,
what
do
the
petitioners
do
here?
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
that
depends
upon
the
scope
of
the
license.
a
common
license
under
a
patent,
for
example,
gives
the
licensee
the
right
to
make
machines
covered
by
the
patent.
normally,
he
can
make
as
many
as
he
wants
to,
paying
the
patentee
a
royalty
for
each
machine.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
the
only
license
here
is
the
implied
license
by
the
sale
of
a
specific
machine.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
that
implied
license
grants
to
the
owner
of
the
machine
the
right
to
use
that
machine
for
the
original
purpose
for
which
it
was
bought,
free
of
the
--
of
any
further
claim
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
--
of
a
patentee.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
the
log
in,
of
course
with
any
implied
license,
you
have
to
look
at
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
if
a
machine
is
capable
of
only
one
use
as
built,
well
then
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
the
implied
license
is
that
the
person
has
the
right
to
use
that
machine
as
built.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
he
also
has
the
right,
so
that
it
can
continue
to
operate
in
the
manner
as
built.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
no,
the
chaffee
case
has
language
in
it
that
states
that
the
owner
of
a
machine
can
improve
the
machines.
now,
i
take
it
that
that
language
means
that
the
owner
of
a
machine
can,
for
example,
makes
structural
changes
to
make
the
machine
stronger
so
that
it
will
operate
in
a
more
effective
way.
but,
however,
i
believe
that
that
should
be
limited
to
maintaining
the
machine
for
the
original
purpose
for
which
it
was
bought.
that's
all
that
was
bargained
for
by
the
original
buyer
and
by
the
original
seller.
as
for
example
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
no,
your
honor.
we
are
not
contending
in
any
way
that
the
petitioners
here
should've
thrown
away
the
1-pound
machines.
they
had
the
perfect
right
under
the
facts
of
this
case
to
buy
those
machines,
restore
them
to
their
original
use,
and
continue
to
use
them,
that,
they
had
full
right
to
do.
however,
when
they
changed
these
machines,
they
changed
it
to
obtain
an
increased
economic
value
of
the
patent.
there
is
no
other
reason
for
them
to
spend
money
to
convert
a
machine
that
they
had
bought
to
another
use,
unless
that
additional
use
is
going
to
be
more
valuable
to
them.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
no,
it
is
our
contention
that
he
has
the
right
--
again,
this
is
in
absence
of
any
other
agreement
between
the
parties.
this
is
simply
where
a
person
buys
a
patented
machine
and
nothing
more
is
said.
we
say
that
that
person
has
the
right
to
continue
to
use
this
machine
for
the
purpose
for
which
he
bought
it.
that's
why
he
bought
it,
was
to
use
it
in
the
condition
that
it
existed
when
built
and
when
sold.
now,
later
on,
if
he
decides
that
he
can
make
more
money
from
this
machine,
from
the
invention
by
changing
the
machine,
then
he's
getting
something.
he's
getting
an
additional
use
of
the
invention
which
was
never
bargained
for
in
the
beginning.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
in
that
case
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
--
in
that
case,
i
would
say
that
you
would
violate
the
patent.
now
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
you
own
the
coffee
pot
for
its
original
purpose.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
yes,
i
believe
that's
the
rationale
of
the
wilson
versus
simpson
cases
cited
as
one
of
the
leading
authorities
in
the
aro
case.
now,
as
far
as
you're
changing
it
to
make
a
quart
of
coffee,
well,
then
you
are
using
a
machine
which
you
didn't
buy
originally
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
the
inventive
flash
of
genius
of
course
occurred
when
the
--
the
one-pint
coffee
maker
first
became
available
to
you.
without
the
inventor's
flash
of
genius,
that
coffee
pot
never
would
have
existed.
now,
by
buying
that
one-pint
coffeemaker,
you
obtained
the
right
to
practice
the
invention
to
the
extent
that
you
bought.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
yes.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
you
would
be
--
you
would
be
using
the
same
machine
then
without
any
modification
whatsoever.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
in
that
sense,
you
again
would
be
using
a
machine
which
had
not
been
purchased
from
the
patentee
to
which
that
license
did
not
extend.
now,
you're
imposing
a
situation
in
which
you
might
say
the
damages
are
almost
de
minimis.
now,
we
aren't
--
we
aren't
saying
you
would
have
to
buy
a
brand-new
coffeepot
for
either
those
half-pint
size
or
for
the
one-quart
size.
we
aren't
insisting
that
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
all
we
are
asking
for
in
this
case,
and
it
would
apply
to
you
as
well,
is
that
the
user
of
this
converted
machine
compensate
the
patentee
for
the
additional
value
of
the
invention
which
was
not
originally
given
to
him
in
the
original
purchase.
as
for
example,
again,
in
your
coffeepot
situation,
although
it's
hard
to
imagine
the
exact
situation,
but
supposed
that,
originally,
you
could've
bought
an
adjustable
coffeepot
which
would
make
either
one
pint
or
one
quart.
i've
never
seen
such
a
machine
but
i
suppose
one
could
be
built.
in
such
a
case,
that
machine
would
have
double
the
versatility
of
the
original
machine
and
the
inventor
would've
been
entitled
to
a
greater
royalty
because
of
the
increased
versatility
of
the
invention
which
he
is
granting
to
the
purchaser
to
use.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
if
you
took
the
adjustable
part
out
and
--
and
made
coffee,
there,
you'll
have
a
situation
in
which
the
machine
that
you
bought
would
have
the
same
use
as
the
original
machine.
and,
to
that
extent,
i
imagine
that
there
would
not
be
any
infringement.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
in
essence,
yes.
and,
of
course,
i
think,
as
a
practical
matter,
that's
what
will
happened
but,
returning
to
the
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
yes,
your
honor.
actually,
the--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
in
some
instances,
he
replaced
some.
in
another
instances,
he
refurbished
them.
in
some
instances,
parts
did
not
require
changing
to
convert
the
machine
to
the
new
use.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
they
were
--
six
were
changed.
the
facts
are
that
some
were
removed
and
junked
because
they
were
no
further
used
and
were
replaced
with
new
elements.
others
were
removed
and
sandblasted,
had
the
rest
in
corrosion
taken
off
and
then
put
back
into
the
machine.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
your
question.
the
machine
--
the
5-ounce
machine
which
was
original
--
which
was
finally
arrived
at,
operated
in
the
same
--
i
understand.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
some
of
the
parts
of
the
5-ounce
machine
were
the
same
as
in
the
1-pound
machine.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
most
of
them
were,
because
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
yes,
as
far
as
numbers,
i
believe
that
the
exact
number
of
elements
which
were
changed
is
relatively
important.
the
question
is
have
all
the
elements
been
changed
that
were
necessary
to
convert
it
to
the
new
use.
in
one
machine,
it
may
take
60%
of
the
elements.
another
machine,
it
may
take
90%
of
the
elements.
each
machine
is
going
to
present
a
different
factual
situation.
but,
the
question,
as
i
see
it,
is
whether
the
5-ounce
machine
is
the
same
machine
as
the
original
1-pound
machine.
now,
the
district
court
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
that
is
correct.
as
far
as
the
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and,
the
court
of
appeals
came
to
the
same
conclusion
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
i
--
of
course,
i
read
the
dissenting
opinion
and,
frankly,
i
disagree
with
it
because
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
that
the
majority
did
direct
themselves
to
that
question.
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
court
of
appeals
also
said
that
the
district
court
had
not
come
to
any
determination
as
to
whether
a
new
machine
had
been
created
and,
in
that,
i
believe
it
was
in
error
because,
in
the
record
at
page
24
which
is
the
decision
by
the
district
court,
the
judge
says,
"however,
as
previously
noted,
defendants
do
not
rest
satisfied
with
the
restoration
of
the
machine
to
its
original
condition.
they
proceeded
to
change
its
elements,
not
to
restore
the
additional,
but
to
build
another
machine
designed
to
fill
cans
of
a
different
size
than
the
cans
for
which
the
original
was
manufactured
and
sold.”
now,
i
think
clearly
that
the
district
court
directed
itself
to
the
question
of
whether
a
new
machine
had
been
made.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
i
think
judge
merrill
was
concerned
because
he
didn't
believe
that
the
patentee
had
been
hurt
because
that's
the
specific
question
which
he
put
to
me
and,
apparently,
i
did
not
answer
to
his
satisfaction.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
yes.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
and,
again,
i
think
that
the
question
to
really
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
yes,
and
i
--
it
is
my
feeling
that
that
is
an
unimportant
limitation
to
put
on
this.
i
might
note
that
this
court,
in
discussing
the
cotton-tie
case,
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
cotton-tie,
as
originally
sold,
was
marked
licensed
for
use
once
only
and
that
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
it
was
used
only
once
and
then
voluntarily
destroyed
and
then
recreated.
and,
to
digress
for
a
moment,
that
is
what
we
contend
has
happened
here,
too,
is
that
the
petitioners
here
bought
these
four
1-pound
machines
as
junk.
they
destroyed
their
utility
as
1-pound
machines
in
making
the
new
machine.
but,
anyway,
to
get
back
to
the--
this
license,
the
thought
of
having
to
restrict
the
purchaser
as
to
what
he
can
do
with
the
machine,
i
might
make
an
analogy
between
a
landowner.
suppose
that
a
landowner
has
two
adjacent
parcels
of
land
that
he
owns
and
he
sells
one
of
these
parcels
without
any
reference
to
the
other
parcel.
now,
no
one
would
contend
that
the
buyer,
through
failure
to
mention
this
other
parcel,
would
then
own
both
parcels.
now,
the
parallel
here
is
that
the
patentee
originally
has
the
right
to
exclude
anyone
from
using
a
1-pound
machine
and
he
has
the
right
to
exclude
someone
from
using
a
5-ounce
machine.
now,
if
he
sells
a
1-pound
machine
having
no
other
use
than
to
pack
1-pound
cans,
without
any
mention
of
a
5-ounce
machine,
i
don't
see
that
the
purchaser
of
the
1-pound
machine
gets
anymore
rights
than
to
use
the
machine
which
he
bought.
if
he
wanted
those
additional
rights
of
the
patentee,
then
he
should've
asked
the
patentee
for
those
rights,
bargain
with
the
patentee
for
those
rights,
and
pay
the
patentee
a
royalty
for
these
increased
rights
which
he
wanted.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
that
to
me
is
a
situation
wherein,
if
anyone
sells
any
article
which
--
and
he
has
additional
rights,
that
would
require
him
to
say
that
“well,
you
buy
this
article
but
you
can't
have
this
right
that
i
own,
you
can't
have
this
right
that
i
own,
and
so
forth,”
enumerating
all
the
additional
rights
that
he
has.
but,
what
do
the
parties
bargained
for
originally?
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
no,
the
--
what
he
bought
was
a
machine
to
pack
1-pound
cans.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
i
drive
that
from
the
language
of
the
wilson
case,
for
example,
which
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
in
the
wilson
case,
it
states
that
replacement
of
that
worn-out
essential
part
is
permissible
restoration
of
the
machine
to
the
original
use
for
which
it
was
bought,
and
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
that's
correct.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
if
you
don't
have
restoration
and
you
have
reconstruction
which
is,
to
me,
impermissible,
just
as
in
this
court's
statement
concerning
the
cotton-tie.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
no,
i
didn't
say
that,
your
honor.
he
has
full
right
to
repair
the
machine
to
enable
him
to
use
it
for
the
original
purpose
for
which
it
was
bought.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
that
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
no,
you
--
if
i
understand
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
now,
that's
--
if
that
is
an
adaptation
of
the
machine
to
the
particular
plant
so
that
it
can
perform
the
specific
function
for
which
it
was
bought,
then
that's
perfectly
permissible.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
that
is
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
no,
that
would
entirely
be
the
particular
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
yes,
your
honor.
now,
our
--
our
position,
again,
is
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
buying
a
general
license
under
a
patent
and
buying
a
license
in
--
as
implied
from
the
sale
of
a
particular
machine.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
no,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
--
we
argued
that
for
the
district
court
and
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
and,
the
district
court
said
that
that
would
be
permissible
restoration
under
the
doctrine
of
the
aro
case.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
however
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
no,
our
argument
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
that
is
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
your
honor,
the
facts
of
the
case
are
--
is
that
additional
money
was
spent
to
change
the
machines
from
the
1-pound
size
to
the
5-ounce
size.
and,
to
get
back
to
what
i
consider
the
basis
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
the
only
--
the
only
way
in
which
they
could
use
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
--
the
original
plungers
was
to
use
them
in
the
converted
machines.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
that
would
be
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
perhaps
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
the
question
though,
in
my
mind,
is
whether
the
present
converted
machine
is
the
same
machine
as
was
originally
purchased.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
your
honor,
the
exact
proportion
of
money
to
repair
it
to
a
1-pound
or
to
clean
it
up
and
then
change
it
to
a
5-ounce
i
do
not
feel
is
--
would
be
determinative
here.
i
think
that
the
question
really
is
that,
in
this
case,
the
purchaser
to
these
machines,
the
petitioners,
who
were
not
the
original
purchasers,
they
bought
them
as
junks
so
that
they
could
salvage
what
parts
they
could
get
to
make
5-ounce
machines
which
were
more
valuable.
otherwise,
it
wouldn't
have
gone
to
the
work
of
changing
them.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
and
larger
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
that
is
our
argument.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
he's
reconstructing
it
if
there
is
a
different
machine
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
there
could
instances
in
which
that
would
be
true.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
i
mean,
i
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
i
can
assume
that
there
are
cases
in
which
that
is
true
and
i
could
assume
that,
actually,
there
would
be
cases
in
which
you
--
it
would
be
cheaper
to
clean
it
up
and
reconvert
it
than
to
restore
it
to
the
original
position.
but,
again,
my
argument
is
that
the
converted
machines,
the
5-ounce
machines,
have
a
particular
value
of
the
patent.
they
will
enable
the
user
to
exploit
the
patent
in
a
way
which
was
never
contemplated
by
the
original
purchaser
of
the
machine
or
by
the
seller
of
the
original
machine.
it's
for
this
additional
exploitation
that
we
feel
that
we're
entitled
to
a
royalty.
now,
as
mr.
justice
black
stated
in
his
opinion
in
the
aro
case,
one
sale--
one
royalty
for
one
sale
of
machine
is
enough,
but
we
don't
think
that
that
is
quite
applicable
here.
there
was
a
royalty
paid
for
the
1-pound
machine.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
pardon?
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
but
it
could
work
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
it
could
work
on
1-pound
machines.
it
could
work
on
1-pound
cans.
the
court
below
specifically
stated
that
they
could've
restored
it
to
its
use
as
a
1-pound
machine
and
continued
to
use
it.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
then?
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
no,
your
honor.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
now,
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
yes,
your
honor.
we
say
that
he
violates
the
patent
because
he
is
practicing
the
invention
in
an
unauthorized
way
which
was
never
given
to
him.
it's
for
that
unauthorized
use
of
the
invention
on
these
new
machines
that
we
feel
that
he's
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
that's
all
the
machine
could
do.
it
was
totally
un
--
it
was
not
adjustable.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
if
he
had
packed
oysters,
if
he
could've
packed
oysters,
that
would've
been
alright.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
the
invention
is
a
particular
machine
which
has
its
utmost
utility
in
packing
sardines.
it
could
pack
oysters
if
a
person
wanted
to
use
it
in
packing
oysters
without
modification
of
the
machine.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
then
i
would
say
that,
again,
there
would
be
a
new
machine
for
a
new
use.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
a
second
creation
of
the
--
of
the
invention.
now,
it
may
not
be
a
completely
new
machine,
in
that
there
many
parts
of
the
old
machine
used
in
the
new
machine,
but
it's
a
second
creation
of
the
--
of
the
invention.
as
for
example,
in
the
cotton-tie
case,
the
reconstituted
ties
were
made
up
of
scrap
of
the
original
ties
and
of
the
original
buckles.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
yes,
but
they
took
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
but
they
took
the
same
--
they
took
the
same
metal
that
had
been
used
in
the
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
if
it
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
yes,
but
it
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
and
that
is
our
contention,
your
honor.
our
contention,
again,
is
that
there
has
been
a
second
creation
of
the
patented
entity
in
a
situation
very
similar
to
cotton-tie.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
of
course
if
that
had
been
done,
there'd
be
no
question,
but
what
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
not
as
i
read
the
cotton-tie
case,
your
honor.
as
i
read
the
cotton-tie
case,
they
took
the
severed
bands
which
had
been
voluntarily
severed
out
at
the
--
wherever
they
took
these
bales.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
the
severed
ties
were
sold
for
scrap
and
the
infringer
bought
these
ties,
rooted
them
back
together,
the
severed
ends,
attached
the
original
buckle
to
it
and
sold
for
use
again
as
--
for
baling
cotton,
unless
my
memory
fails
me
as
to
the
facts
of
that
case.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
your
honor,
the
amount
of
royalty
in
this
case
which
was
voted
by
the
district
court
has
never
been
a
sale
as
to
its
amount
or
as
to
the
fairness
of
the
award.
the
contention
of
petitioner
has
simply
been
that
they
owe
nothing.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
$1,500
per
machine.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
that
was
the
royalty
which
had
been
awarded
on
or
which
had
been
paid
on
the
original
machine,
yes.
in
this
particular
case,
the
district
court
felt
that
that
was
a
reasonable
royalty
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
as
i
say,
the
amount
has
never
been
a
question
as
to
its
fairness
here.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
the
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
no,
no,
we
don't
--
we
don't
claim
profits
at
all.
we
--
all
we
ask
for
and
all
that
we
received
were
reasonable
royalties
which,
in
this
case,
was
held
to
be
$1,500
per
machine.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
it
was
the
same
as
if
it
had
been
a
new
machine.
of
course,
again,
our
contention
is
that
this
machine
for
a
new
purpose
is
a
new
machine.
the
amount
of
royalty,
however,
in
situations
such
like
this,
should
really
perhaps
be
based
upon
the
additional
economic
advantage
to
the
person
who
converts
this
purpose
of
the
machine.
that's
why
they
convert
the
machines
because
they're
worth
more
but,
in
this
case,
they're
unwilling
to
share
the
end
piece
profits
with
the
--
with
the
patentee.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
no.
in
either
case,
i
believe
that
the
patentee
should
have
that
right.
of
course,
it
would
be
based
upon
different
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
yes,
but
he
hasn't
--
he
hasn't
acquired
a
5-ounce
machine.
he
hasn't
acquired
a
machine
with
the
capabilities
of
a
5-ounce
machine
from
the
patentee.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
that's
true
but,
again,
it's
a
question
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
yes,
as
is
capable
by
that
machine.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
yes,
he
is
--
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
yes,
but,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
the
question
here
is,
what
type
of
a
license,
what
type
of
patent
rights
does
a
person
get
by
the
purchase
of
a
machine?
again,
a
purchaser
of
a
machine
does
not
acquire
general
rights
under
the
patent.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
i
realize
that
but
that's
a
--
and
i
believe
that
is
supported
by
the
univis
case
cited
in
our
brief
that,
once
he
goes
beyond
that
limited
license,
and
it
is
a
limited
license,
then
he
becomes
an
infringer.
mr.
carlisle
m.
moore
well,
of
course,
that
is
a
question
to
be
decided
by
this
court.
and
unless
there
are
any
further
questions,
we
rest.
