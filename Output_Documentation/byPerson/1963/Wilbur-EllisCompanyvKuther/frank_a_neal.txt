mr.
frank
a.
neal
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
and
your
honors,
may
the
court
please.
this
is
a
patent
case
and
the
issue
presented
to
the
court
involves
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
acts
complained
about
amounted
to
impermissible
reconstruction.
the
patent
in
suit
is
one
for
a
fish-packing
machine.
there
are
five
claims
to
the
patent.
the
mode
of
operation
of
the
machine
might
be
of
interest
to
the
court.
i
don't
know
how
familiar
the
court
is
with
the
record.
in
any
event,
fish
are
fed
in
by
a
plurality
of
conveyors
and,
eventually,
are
deposited
in
open-top
arcuate
pockets.
after
the
deposit
of
the
fish
in
the
pockets
and
arcuate-top
open-bottom
compressor
comes
down
to
compress
the
bundle
of
fish
into
a
charge
which
would
fit
a
cylindrical
can.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
pardon
me.
it's
shaped
like
this,
your
honor.
the
fish
are
in
here
and
this
comes
down
and
presses
the
fish.
when
that
is
done,
a
plunger
comes
along
and
ejects
the
fish
into
the
can.
it's
a
fairly
high-speed
machine.
now
--
mr.
frank
a.
neal
yes,
sir.
yes
sir.
they
were
primarily
designed
for
the
packing
of
sardines.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
no,
it
isn't.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
it
has
been
litigated
and
it
been
--
has
been
held
to
be
valid.
now,
there
are
four
accused
machines
which
were
acquired
by
the
petitioner,
wilbur-ellis,
by
way
of
a
purchase.
in
other
words,
the
machines
were
the
subject
of
an
outright
and
unconditional
sale
stemming
from
the
respondent.
these
machines,
at
least
three
of
the
four,
were
in
a
fairly
sad
condition
due
to
corrosion
and
so
forth.
and,
the
--
each
of
those
three
machines
were
purchased
at
a
cost
of
$1,250
a
piece.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
no,
they
weren't.
they
were
purchased
from
the
hovden
packing
company,
who
was
the
--
which
was
the
owner
of
the
machines.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
that's
right.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
that's
right.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
the
packing
plant
went
out
of
business
about
1952
and
it
remained
--
the
machinery
and
the
rest
of
the
contents
of
the
plant
remained
there
inactive
and
exposed
to
salt,
sea
air,
and
that
type
of
thing.
as
a
consequence,
the
machines
were
corroded.
in
any
event,
the
petitioner
wilbur-ellis
acquired
these
machines
at
$1,250
a
piece
and
then
went
to
the
other
petitioner,
mr.
leuschner,
and
asked
him
to
recondition
these
machines,
in
this
sense,
to
put
them
in
operating
condition
and
also
to
do
that
which
was
necessary
to
adapt
them
to
feel
what
is
know
in
the
trade
as
“5-ounce
cans,”
as
distinguished
from
“1-pound
tall
cans.”
“5-ounce
cans”
are
considerably
smaller.
there
was
a
fourth
machine.
the
genesis
of
the
fourth
machine
is
a
little
shady
in
the
light
of
the
record
here.
opposing
counsel
and
i
know
where
it
came
from.
we
know
that
it
cost
maybe
a
couple
hundred
dollars
more
for
wilber-ellis
to
acquire.
we
know
that
it
was
in
somewhat
better
condition
than
the
three
which
had
been
standing
down
around
moss
landing,
south
of
monterey.
in
any
event,
mr.
leuschner
took
the
machines
apart,
sand-blasted
them
--
mr.
frank
a.
neal
yes,
sir?
mr.
frank
a.
neal
well,
mr.
leuschner?
mr.
frank
a.
neal
no,
he
didn't,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
he
bought
them
from
the
owner,
a
packing
company
by
the
name
of
hovden
packing
company.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
yes,
but
they
were
the
outright
owner.
the
packing
company
owned
the
machines
outright.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
that
is
right.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
they
had
--
they
--
that
is
right.
mr.
kuther,
the
respondent
and
the
patentee
received
a
royalty
of
$1,500
for
each
one
of
those
machines
which
normally
--
mr.
frank
a.
neal
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
no,
no,
no.
those
machines
sold
in
the
price
range
of
$8,000
to
$10,000
and
mr.
kuther
received
a
royalty
of
$1,500
each
time
such
a
machine
was
sold.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
no.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
the
party
who
sold
the
machines.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
yes.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
mr.
kuther
--
mr.
frank
a.
neal
no,
it
isn't
in
the
record,
but
mr.
kuther
actually
was
an
employee
of
the
hovden
company
and
so,
the
machines
were
built
at
the
expense
of
the
hovden
company
and
when
the
hovden
company
sold
the
machine
--
mr.
frank
a.
neal
and
$1,500
went
to
mr.
kuther.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
that
is
right.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
no,
sir.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
no,
sir
--
no,
sir.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
yes.
the
record
doesn't
reflect
that
but,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
the
trade
does
pack
5-ounce
cans.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
they
use
the
very
same
machines.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
that
is
right.
and
there,
again,
they
have
been
converted
from
the
1-pound-tall
can
size
to
the
5-ounce
can
size.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
no.
for
the
most
part,
there
were
some
charges
and,
again,
this
holds
the
record,
but
there
were
charges
of
infringement
and
those
charged
with
infringement,
which
included
such
large
companies
as
star-kist
tuna,
did
pay
for
the
right
to
convert.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
well,
it
depends
on
what
is
required
to
convert
it
to
the
other
size.
now,
here,
in
order
to
convert
the
original
machines,
after
they
had
been
cleaned
up
to
the
5-ounce
can
handling
size,
it
was
necessary
to
either
resize
or
relocated
six
parts.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
characterized
the
total
number
of
parts
as
being
in
the
order
of
35.
this
would
cover
essential
parts,
and
i
use
the
word
“essential”
in
the
sense
that
the
parts
which
are
essential
are
recited
in
the
claims.
they
are
elements
of
the
claims.
35,
undoubtedly,
includes
both
essential
and
non-essential
parts
but
the
35
parts
were
in
the
machines
which
embodied
the
patented
entity.
now,
the
court
might
be
interested
in
the
extent
to
which
each
of
the
five
claims
of
the
patent
was
affected
by
the
changes
of
the
six
parts.
now,
for
example,
claim
one
was
directed
or
is
directed
to
the
combination
of
nine
elements.
when
i
say
elements,
i
should
explain
it
further
in
this
sense.
it
calls
for
means
for
delivering
produce
to
the
receivers.
now,
the
means
may
embrace
a
number
of
elements.
it
calls
for
a
plurality
of
radially
disposed
arms,
so
that
were
--
when
we're
talking
about
nine
elements,
we're
really
talking
about
nine
classes
of
elements
here.
and,
out
of
those
nine
classes
of
elements
called
for
in
claim
one,
six
out
of
nine
were
either
resized
or
relocated
in
order
to
adapt
these
machines
to
handle
the
smaller
cans.
claim
two
calls
for
the
combination
of
some-seven
groups
of
elements
and,
in
order
to
modify
the
machines
to
handle
the
smaller
cans,
three
out
of
those
seven
groups
of
elements
were
modified.
claim
three
calls
for
a
combination
of
four
groups
of
elements.
it
is
interesting,
i
believe,
to
advise
the
court
that
no
one
of
the
four
elements
of
claim
three
was
affected
by
these
resizing
or
relocation.
claim
four
calls
for
a
combination
of
seven
groups
of
elements,
three
of
which
were
modified
as
to
size
or
location.
claim
five
calls
for
five
groups
of
elements,
three
out
of
the
five
having
been
either
resized
or
relocated.
now,
as
i
represent
it
to
the
court
and
as
the
record
and
the
findings
will
bear
out,
the
four
machines
in
question
were
sold
outright
and
unconditionally.
hence,
they
had
become
fully
released
from
the
patent
monopoly.
this
court
has
held
that
many
times
in
connection
with
cases
of
this
general
type
and
cases
which
are
fairly
closely
related,
among
such
cases,
the
earlier
--
among
such
earlier
cases
of
this
type
decided
by
this
court
was
the
case
of
chappie
versus
boston
building
wherein,
and
i'll
just
quote
briefly
from
the
court's
opinion,
“by
a
valid
sale
and
purchase,
the
patented
machine
becomes
the
private
individual
property
of
the
purchaser
and
is
no
longer
protected
by
the
laws
of
united
states
but
by
the
laws
of
the
state
in
which
it
is
situated.
hence,
it
is
obvious
that
if
a
person
legally
acquires
a
title
to
that
which
is
the
subject
of
letters
patent,
he
may
continue
to
use
it
until
it
is
worn
out
or
he
may
repair
it
or
improve
upon
it
as
he
pleases
in
the
same
manner
as
if
dealing
with
property
of
any
other
kind.”
in
other
words,
having
been
fully
released
from
the
patent
monopoly,
the
machines
in
question
took
upon
the
full
and
complete
nature
of
general
personal
property.
as
an
owner
of
general
personal
property,
i
may
destroy
it.
i
may
do
anything
i
wish
with
it.
here,
the
machines
were
not
destroyed.
instead,
they
were
cleaned
up
to
put
them
into
operative
use
and
less
than
the
entire
patented
entity
was
modified.
to
me,
the
courts
below
took
the
wrong
bend
in
the
road
at
this
juncture
and
when
the
district
court
said
that
it
is
the
right
of
the
patentee
to
either
put
the
invention
of
his
patent
into
use
or
not
to
put
it
into
use,
and
this
is
clear.
this
has
been
decided
by
this
court
in
the
paper
bag
case.
but
--
pardon
me?
mr.
frank
a.
neal
in
the
paper
bag
case,
your
honor.
but,
then,
the
court
goes
on
and
says
this,
“since
he
has
the
right
to
keep
it
entirely
out
of
use,
he
has
the
right
perforce
to
put
it
into
use
but
to
attach
any
condition
that
he
wishes
to
it,
to
the
use
of
it.”
now,
this
was
the
rationale
of
the
district
court
and
it
was
precisely
that
rationale
which
this
court
rebutted
in
the
case
of
motion
picture
patent
versus
universal.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
well,
in
a
sense.
i'll
explain
that
in
this
fashion.
that
it
is
now
the
position
of
the
respondent
that
an
implied
condition
is
put
on
the
use,
in
that,
the
machine
was
only
made
to
handle
1-pound
cans.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
no,
outside
of
that,
nothing.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
nothing,
no
sir.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
no,
that
is
right,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
now,
in
the
motion
picture
case,
their
movie
projectors
were
sold
outright
in
the
sense
that
the
seller
obtained
the
full
consideration
for
the
equipment
but
he
put
a
notice
on
the
equipment
saying
“limited
to
the
use
with
film
to
the
--
to
use
with
films
covered
by
another
patent
owned
by
the
seller
of
the
equipment.”
and,
just
like
the
district
court
here,
the
court
there
--
i
think
both
courts
there,
both
the
district
and
the
court
of
--
the
appellate
court
held
that
that
was
already
--
it
could
attach
such
a
condition
to
the
use
of
that
equipment.
however,
the
court
said
this,
and
they
had
reference
to
the
decision
by
the
court
immediately
below
which
had
approved
that
type
of
an
arrangement,
“this
decision
proceeds
upon
the
argument
that,
since
the
patentee
may
withhold
his
patent
all
together
from
public
use,
he
must
logically
and
necessarily
be
permitted
to
impose
any
conditions
which
he
chooses
upon
any
use
which
he
may
allow
of
it.”
the
defect
in
this
thinking
springs
from
the
substituting
of
inference
and
argument
for
the
language
of
the
statute
and
from
failure
to
distinguish
between
the
rights
which
are
given
to
the
inventor
by
the
patent
law
and
which
he
may
assert
against
all
the
world
through
an
infringement
proceeding
and
rights
which
he
may
create
for
himself
by
private
contract
which,
however,
are
subject
to
the
rules
of
general
as
distinguished
from
those
of
the
patent
law.
while
it
is
true
that
under
the
statute,
it
says
they
were
and
now
are,
a
patentee
might
withhold
his
patented
machine
from
public
use.
yet,
if
he
consented
to
use
it
himself
or
through
others,
such
use
immediately
fell
within
the
terms
of
the
statute
and,
as
we
have
seen,
he
is
thereby
restricted
to
the
use
of
the
invention
as
it
is
described
in
the
claims
of
his
patent
and
not
as
it
may
be
expanded
by
limitations
as
to
materials
and
supplies
necessary
to
the
operation
of
it
imposed
by
mere
notice
to
the
public.
and,
i
might
carry
the
motion
picture
case
one
point
further
in
this
sense,
that
it
perhaps
is
even
closer
to
the
case
at
bar
than
the
aro
case
because,
while
respondent
here
is
really
complaining
about
a
making
in
the
sent
--
in
the
sense
of
a
reconstruction,
at
bottom,
what
he
is
really
complaining
about
is
a
conversion
of
the
machine
to
a
new
use,
which
new
use
was
never
made
in
the
machine
by
the
petitioners.
in
that
sense,
named
--
in
talking
about
1-pound
cans,
and
so
forth,
as
compared
to
5-ounce
cans,
this
case
is
not
unlike,
in
too
great
a
sense,
the
motion
picture
case
because
they
are
now
talking
about
the
materials
that
go
through
or
which
are
processed
by
the
machines
covered
by
the
patent.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
well,
it
might
be
of
interest
to
the
court
also
to
--
i
don't
think
i
mentioned
this,
but
to
give
the
court
some
idea
as
to
what
was
involved
in
getting
these
machines
into
condition
to
put
them
to
use
with
5-ounce
cans.
there
was
the
initial
purchase
price
of
$1,250
per
machine.
then,
mr.
leuschner
charged
$1,600
and
that's
broken
down
in
this
manner.
$1,350
of
which
was
to
clean
the
machines
up,
$250
of
which
was
to
affect
these
matters
of
resizing
or
relocation
and,
now,
the
respondent
has
his
hand
in
petitioner's
pocket
to
the
tune
of
$1,500
per
machine
as
a
second
royalty.
now,
the
circuit
court
didn't
expressly
follow
the
rationale
of
the
district
court
which
i
have
just
spoken
of.
however,
it
referred
to
the
district
court's
decision
as
a
well-reasoned
one
and
the
circuit
court
fell
in
with
the
first
co
--
circuit
and
the
eighth
circuit
where
you
--
where
the
courts
were
faced
with
the
matter
of
resizing
or
relocating
or
enhancing
capacity
of
patented
machinery.
in
the
george
close
versus
ideal
machinery
company
case,
which
is
a
first
circuit
case,
you
had
a
candy-wrapping
machine
adapted
as
it
was
made
and
sold
to
wrap
--
to
cut
and
wrap
caramels
of
a
specific
size.
the
owner
of
the
machine
changed
the
machine
by
re-spacing
the
cutting
knives
and
whatever
else
was
involved
so
that
it
would
produce
a
slightly
larger
caramel.
and,
of
course,
he
was
charged
with
infringement,
suit
ensued,
both
courts
held
that
that
type
of
thing
amounted
to
an
infringement
by
way
of
reconstruction.
but,
there,
the
first
circuit,
they
said
the
test
was
this.
the
test
was
whether
the
identity
of
the
machine
had
been
changed
and
they
--
the
court
equated
change
in
identity
with
change
in
capacity.
whereas,
in
reality,
when
we're
talking
about
what
is
covered
by
a
patent,
identity
has
reference
to
the
patent
claims.
the
court
made
no
reference
--
no
controlling
reference
to
the
claims
in
that
case,
neither
did
it
do
so,
that
is
the
eighth
circuit
court,
in
a
fairly
parallel
case
entitled
“miller
hatcheries
versus
buckeye.”
there,
you
had
a
matter
of
enhancing
the
capacity
of
an
egg
incubator
by
adding
things
and
relocating
elements
and
that
type
of
thing.
so,
our
position
here
is
this
that
neither
court
below
has
properly
applied
the
criteria
which
call
for
application
here.
and,
in
failing
to
do
so,
both
courts
below
have
violated
the
constitutional
standard
as
to
the
--
as
to
protection
of
the
rights
of
inventors
and,
of
course,
the
implementing
statutes.
now
--
mr.
frank
a.
neal
yes.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
yes,
it
is.
we
would
--
would
have
been
unable
to
get
a
patent
because--
mr.
frank
a.
neal
that
is
correct.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
in
this
instance,
yes,
because
there's
been
no
past
history
of
anybody
else
who
is
on
the
market
with
a
5-ounce
machine
to
serve
the
capacity
or
to
do
the
work
that
this
particular
machine
did.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
i
don't
know.
the
record
is
silent
on
that.
nobody
made
any
such
request
that
i
know
of.
in
actuality
--
mr.
frank
a.
neal
no,
these
very
same
machines
which
were
originally
made
for
the
1-pound
tall
cans,
mr.
chief
justice,
were
in
the
hands
of
two
--
of
sardine
packers
up
and
down
the
west
coast.
now,
i
wouldn't
be
here
today
had
not
the
sardines
disappeared
from
the
monterey
area.
that's
what
caused
the
canneries
to
close
down
in
cannery
row.
and,
the
available
machine
--
the
available
sardines,
excuse
me,
became
a
little
smaller
so
they
wa
--
required
smaller
containers
to
pack
them
in
and
so,
after
this
episode
of
the
closing
down
of
the
hovden
packing
plant,
some
of
the
packing
plants
in
los
angeles
area,
del
monte
area,
remained
in
operation
but
they,
too,
required
that
their
machines
be
adapted
to
fill
a
5-ounce
can.
now,
they
went
to
mr.
kuther,
the
respondent
here,
and
paid
him
money
to
receive
permission
to
do
that.
now,
when
i
say
though
that
both
of
the
courts
below
have
violated
the
constitutional
provisions
and
the
implementing
statute,
this
is
what
i
mean.
article
i,
section
8,
of
the
constitution
gives
the
sole
power
to
congress
to
protect,
for
a
limited
time,
the
rights
of
inventors
to
their
respective
discoveries.
and,
under
that
constitutional
provision,
there
has
been
a
whole
succession
of
patent
acts
commencing
in
1790.
the
key
ones
were
1790,
1836,
and
1870,
and
the
latest
in
1952.
now,
the
statute,
35
--
title
35,
united
states
code,
section
154
defines
what
the
grant
of
a
patent
means
and
it
means
that
the
patentee
is
given
the
right
to
exclude
others
from
making,
using,
or
selling
his
invention.
section
271
(a)
refers
to
infringement
and
says
“he
who,
without
authority,
makes
or
uses
or
sells
an
invention
shall
be
liable
for
infringement.”
so,
that
we
have
this.
there
are
three
ways
in
which
a
patent
can
be
infringed
-
making,
using,
or
selling.
now,
section
112
requires
the
applicant
for
a
patent
to
particularly
point
out
and
distinctly
claim
his
patent.
that's
the
patent
claims.
it's
like
a
real
estate
deed
in
effect.
so
that,
when
all
those
are
taken
together,
and
it's
always
the
claim
which
is
looked
to,
to
see
whether
there
has
been
a
making,
or
using,
or
selling.
now,
so
that
you
cannot
have
a
making
by
way
of
reconstruction
unless
you
have
the
entire
patented
entity
or
the
entire
combination
remade.
that
i
think
is
the
full
sense
of
mr.
justice
black's
concurring
opinion
in
the
recent
aro
case.
he
--
mr.
justice
black
did
advert
to
this
marginal
type
of
thing
where,
perhaps
all
else
except
a
bolt
and
a
nut
might
be
changed.
but
he
said
“let
us
leave
that
to
the
time
when
we
reach
a
situation
like
that,”
but
that
is
not
this.
as
i
have
pointed
out
to
the
court,
in
respect
of
each
of
the
five
claims
of
the
patent
in
suit,
at
least
two
to
three
essential
elements
of
the
combination
were
left
unmodified
and,
hence,
unmade
by
the
activities
of
the
petitioners.
and,
we
say
that
this
cannot
amount
to
reconstruction
or
infringement
by
way
of
reconstruction.
that
to
reach
such
a
conclusion
is
to
accord
or
confer
patent
monopoly
on
something
which
was
not
the
discovery
of
mr.
kuther.
he
didn't
discover
the
sub-combination,
namely,
the
six
out
of
the
nine
elements
which
were
modified
with
respect
to
claim
one.
if
he
had
discovered
it,
he
should've
claimed
it,
but
he
didn't.
so,
to
say
that
claim
one
or
any
one
of
the
other
five
claims
ha
--
we're
infringed
by
the
modifying
activities
of
the
petitioners
is
to
confer
patent
monopoly
where
it
is
not
deserving
to
be
conferred.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
yes.
a
machine--
mr.
frank
a.
neal
oh,
yes.
yes
your
honor.
yes,
that
is
true.
these
claims
refer
to
packing
machines
completely
independent
of
the
size
or
capacity
of
the
cans
which
go
through
them.
the
cans
are
not
an
element
of
any
one
of
the
claims.
the
claims
are
referred
to
by
way
of
background
or
environmental
description.
so
that,
both
before
and
afterwards,
the
1-pound
packing
machine
and
the
5-ounce
packing
machine
were
embraced
by
the
language
of
the
claims
but,
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
by
virtue
of
the
outright
and
unconditional
sale,
the
machine,
in
the
1-pound
sense
at
least,
had
been
fully
and
for
all
time
released
from
the
patent
monopoly.
now,
the
question
is
did
the
machine
get
back
into
the
patent
monopoly
so
as
to
require
a
further
royalty,
and
that
only
raises
this
question
as
to
whether
there
was
a
remaking
in
the
sense
of
substantially
the
entire
patented
entity.
this,
we
submit,
did
not
occur.
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
possible
rebuttal.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
thank
you.
mr.
frank
a.
neal
i
merely
have
a
couple
of
observations
to
make,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
are
two
anomalies
as
i
see
it,
here
in
the
situation
as
supported
or
contended
for
by
mr.
moore
and,
in
the
position
we
find
ourselves
in,
in
the
light
of
the
decisions
of
the
two
courts
below.
the
first
one,
of
course,
is
the
one
that
mr.
justice
white
just
had
reference
to,
that
when
one
buys
something
that's
covered
by
a
patent
and
he
acquires
it
by
way
of
outright
sale.
there
is
no
longer
a
tether
between
the
patentee
and
the
item
which
now
belongs,
100%
in
all
of
its
aspects,
to
the
purchaser.
he,
therefore,
is
entitled
to
derive
as
much
use
out
of
that
as
it
is
possible
to
obtain.
the
second
anomaly
is
this,
that
in
holding
that
it
was
--
would
not
have
been
infringement
for
us
to
have
replaced
the
six
units
with
units
precisely
the
same
in
size
as
the
original
ones
but,
on
the
other
hand,
it
was
infringement
for
us
to
resize
those
six
units
or
relocate
them,
that
patent
monopoly
was
conferred
on
an
aggregation
of
those
six
elements
but
only
when
they're
used
not
in
conjunction
with
the
1-pound
can.
on
the
cotton-tie
case,
there
again,
i
think
the
court
in
aro
observed,
and
properly
so,
that
it
was
the
strap
that
was
patented
and
not
the
combination
of
the
strap
and
the
belt,
and
i
think
that
pretty
well
covers
it.
i
thank
the
court.
