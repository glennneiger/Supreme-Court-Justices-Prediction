mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
civil
antitrust
case
in
which
the
government
is
appealing
from
the
dismissal
by
the
district
court
after
trial
of
a
compliant
challenging
a
bank
merger
under
the
sherman
act.
the
merger
involved
a
consolidation
of
the
largest
and
the
fourth
largest
bank
in
fayette
county,
kentucky
and
resulting
institution,
as
i
shall
develop,
had
better
than
50%
of
all
the
banking
assets
in
the
area.
now
in
this
case,
unlike
the
philadelphia
bank
case
of
last
term,
the
government
did
not
challenge
this
consolidation
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
mr.
justice
and
the
reason
for
it
is
this.
at
the
time
this
suit
was
filed
which
was
approximately
about
the
time
of
the
philadelphia
bank
decision,
there
was
considerable
uncertainty
as
to
whether
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
applied
to
the
banks
mergers.
we
studied
this
case
and
this
seemed
to
us
to
be
a
very
strong
case
under
the
sherman
act
and
in
this
circumstances,
it
was
our
considerate
judgment
that
it
would
appropriate
to
charge,
tackle
this
bank
merger
solely
under
the
terms
of
the
sherman
act.
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
primarily
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
for
it's
oral
argument
and
we
--
as
i
have
indicated
we
think
that
--
we
had
argued
to
the
court
that
the
philadelphia
bank
merger
violated
the
sherman
act,
as
i
shall
develop,
we
think
this
is
an
even
stronger
case
than
philadelphia
bank
case.
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
just
don't
know
mr.
justice.
it's
--
the
philadelphia
case
certainly
gives
the
government
a
very
--
only
weapon
in
dealing
with
this,
but
i
would
be
reluctant
to
say
that
cases
might
not
arise
where
it
would
be
appropriate
for
us
to
have
the
sherman
act.
and
we
also
--
i
might
say
we
think
that
this
case
is
brought
under
the
sherman
act,
and
we
think
in
this
case
we
have
established
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
lexington,
kentucky
which
is
the
county
seat
of
fayette
county,
kentucky,
is
a
medium
sized
city
of
about
60,000.
it's
roughly
--
the
population
of
the
county
is
roughly
twice
that.
the
city
has
--
the
whole
area
since
the
war
has
undergone
a
remarkable
industrial
development.
prior
to
that
time
it
was
primarily
a
farming
area.
since
the
war,
it
has
undergone
rapid
industrialization,
characterized
primarily
by
the
influx
of
major
national
concerns
which
set
up
a
number
of
plants
in
the
area.
at
the
time
of
the
merger
which
was
march
1st,
1961,
there
were
total
of
six
banks
in
fayette
county
and
preliminary
matter,
the
district
court
in
this
case
treated
fayette
county
as
the
relevant
geographic
market
within
which
--
to
test
the
effect
of
this
merger
on
competition
and
our
opponents
do
not
challenge
that
ruling.
the
two
merging
banks
were
the
first
national
bank
and
trust
company
and
security
trust
company.
the
first
national
was
the
oldest
and
the
largest
bank
in
the
county.
at
the
time
of
the
merger,
it
was
more
than
twice
the
size
of
any
of
the
other
banks.
between
its
founding
in
1865
and
1929,
it
had
been
involved
in
12
different
mergers
consolidations
or
takeovers
and
at
the
time
of
the
merger
its
deposits
were
$58
million.
it
had
$65
million
in
total
assets
and
$35
million
in
total
loans
and
as
i
shall
demonstrate
in
a
moment,
this
at
that
point
represented
the
largest
bank
by
far
in
the
community.
the
security
trust
company
had
been
organized
in
the
1880s
by
the
businessmen
of
the
community,
primarily
to
provide
corporate
trust
services
for
the
community.
this
bank,
until
1947,
had
not
engaged
in
any
so
called
commercial
banking.
it
was
limiting
itself
to
making
of
secured
loans
and
providing
trust
services.
however
in
1947,
it
went
into
the
commercial
field
and
experienced
a
very
rapid
growth.
now
we
have
set
forth
at
pages
10
and
11
of
our
brief,
charts
which
show
the
statistical
pattern
of
the
distribution
of
the
banking
business
in
fayette
county
and
the
first
chart
at
the
top
of
page
10
shows
the
situation
as
it
was
prior
to
the
merger
and
the
court
will
notice
that
at
that
point
first
national
had
roughly
40%
of
all
the
banking
business
in
the
area.
it
was
at
that
point
more
than
twice
as
large
as
the
second
bank,
citizen's
union,
and
was
approximately
three
times
or
more
the
size
of
security
trust.
now
the
effect
of
the
consolidation
is
shown
in
the
second
chart
on
page
10.
the
court
will
note
that
the
resulting
bank
now
has
more
of
the
assets
than
all
of
other
banks
put
together.
it
has
roughly
52
or
53%
of
the
assets.
this
bank
is
now
three
times
as
large
as
the
second
bank
and
roughly
five
or
six
times
as
large
as
the
smallest
bank.
the
chart
at
the
top
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right,
but
that
we
think
is
significant
mr.
justice
stewart.
of
course
it's
just
addition,
but
the
significance
we
think
is
we
have
a
big
bank
and
this
big
bank
has
combined
into
a
substantial
bank
and
as
i
shall
develop
in
a
moment,
this
case
rests
not
just
on
the
percentages
of
the
market.
we
think
we
have
very
important
and
persuasive
evidence
that
in
this
market,
this
kind
of
concentration
does
have
a
markedly
adverse
affect
on
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
one
thing
mr.
justice
--
i
have
to
answer
that
in
several
steps.
one
thing
as
far
as
security
is
concerned,
is
that
security
did
have
an
advantage,
which
it
had
its
trust
business,
and
the
trust
business
as
the
record
indicates
does
give
a
bank
an
advantage
in
going
into
the
commercial
business.
but
more
important
than
that
we
think
is
that,
and
just
let
me
say
that
they
make
the
argument
that
the
fact
that
first
national
at
a
prior
period
had
a
larger
share
of
the
market
and
had
since
drop
down
to
40%,
that
shows
competition
would
not
adversely
affected
within
this
market.
well,
we
think
there
is
two
things
to
that,
first
there
is
affirmative
evidence
by
the
presidents
of
three
of
the
other
banks
in
the
area
that
in
these
circumstances,
combining
50%
into
this
bank,
with
all
of
the
advantages
which
i'll
come
to
in
a
moment,
does
place
them
under
a
serious
competitive
advantage.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
the
answer
mr.
justice
to
that
as
the
testimony
in
the
record
indicates
that
it's
customary
when
you
have
a
merger
of
two
banks,
if
there
is
some
attrition
in
the
share
of
the
merging
bank
for
a
brief
period
and
indeed
there
was
recognition
that
this
was
not
unexpected
in
this
particular
case.
and
over
and
beyond
that
we
think
that
the
competition
which
is
to
be
protected
in
this
case,
the
competition,
the
protection
of
the
other
banks
that
is
not,
the
negative
effects
are
not
offset
because
there
has
been
a
slight
increase
in
the
percentage
shares
of
the
other
banks.
the
bankers,
the
three
bankers,
the
presidents
of
the
other
banks
in
town
testified,
or
testified
that
there
concern
was
over
the
long
range
effect
of
this,
in
the
long
run
the
greater
economic
power
that
this
bank
would
be
able
to
bear,
bring
to
bear.
now
i
think
one
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
statute
was
for
the
protection
of
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
and
we
think
it's
in
the
interest
of
the
public
that
there
be
a
number
of
effective
banks
in
the
area.
in
other
words,
what
the
statute
is
prohibiting
is
the
elimination
of
an
important
competitor
where
this
will
have
adverse
affects
on
competition.
and
there
are
adverse
effects
on
competition
we
think
when
the
remaining
competitors
in
the
market
will
find
it
more
difficult,
seriously
difficult
to
be
competing
as
effectively
as
they
had
in
the
past.
i
think
mr.
justice
i
would
like
to
point
to
one
aspect
of
the
case
that
i
haven't
yet
mentioned
which
is
suggested
by
our
chart
on
the
top
of
page
11
and
that
is
a
tremendous
share
of
the
corporate
trust
business
which
will
be
the
result
of
this
merger.
although
first
national
only
went
into
the
trust
business
about
20
years
ago,
it
had
managed
to
gain
a
very
substantial
share
of
that
market.
at
the
time
of
the
merger
it
had
roughly
45%
as
against
roughly
50%
in
terms
of
total
trust
assets
of
security
trust.
now
the
effect
of
this
merger
is
to
combine
in
a
single
bank
95%
in
dollar
amount
of
all
the
corporate
trusts
in
the
community
and
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate,
this
by
the
way
would
be
28
more
times
as
large
as
any
of
the
other
banks
in
the
area,
and
i
think
it's
appropriate
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
complaint
charged
that
both
the
trust
business
and
commercial
banking
business
was
a
violation
of
section
2
as
--
the
acquisition
was
both
in
a
combination
to
monopolize
and
a
restraint
of
trade.
we
are
not
pressing
before
this
court
the
argument
that
there
was
a
violation
of
section
2
insofar
as
it
affected
a
combination
to
monopolize
commercial
banking.
the
reason
for
that
is
we
think
if
we
prevail
on
section
1,
the
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
it.
if
we
lose
on
section
1
frankly
we
think
it
is
also
dispositive
of
section
2.
we
are,
however,
continuing
to
press
our
argument
that
in
the
field
of
corporate
trust
services
which
we
think
is
a
separate
part
of
trade
and
commerce
that
this
combination,
this
95%,
does
represent
a
combination
to
monopolize,
but
i
don't
plan
to
argue
that
in
this
court.
i
think
we
will
stand
on
our
brief
on
that
because
again
the
court
need
to
only
to
reach
that
argument
if
it
disagrees
with
those
of
the
sherman
act
point.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
it's
a
relevant
seg
market
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
are
between
men
shoes
and
--
well
between
shoes
and
men
shoes,
between
professional
boxing
and
championship
professional
boxing.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
kind
of
a
distinction.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
we
--
actually
now
i
would
like
to
come
to
that
we
think
the
fact
that
these
banks
have
95%
of
the
trust
business
is
an
important
element
towards
showing
why
in
this
market,
this
combination
is
a
restraint
of
trade
in
violation
of
section
1.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
i
will
come
to
that
in
just
one
moment
if
i
may.
this
case
--
this
case
is
perhaps
an
unusual
case
in
that
three
of
the
four
other
banks
in
the
area,
the
next
three
largest,
the
presidents
of
those
institutions
all
testified
that
in
their
view
this
merger
would
adversely
affect
competition
in
the
community
and
they
explained
at
considerable
length
why
they
believe
that
this
would
have
such
an
effect.
the,
i
might
also
just
point
out
once
again,
reiterate,
they
recognized
that
in
the
year
since
the
merger,
the
trial
is
approximately
one
year
after
the
merger,
they
had
not
noticed
any
discernible
immediate
effect.
in
fact
their
percentages
have
grown
slightly,
but
they
were
concerned,
they
said
with
the
long
range
trend.
now,
the
first
reason
they
gave
why
this
large
bank
would
put
them
under
a
serious
competitive
disadvantage,
rested
on
the
character
of
the
business
community
of
lexington.
as
i
had
indicated
lexington
has
had
a
very
remarkable
economic
growth
and
you
had
a
large
number
of
national
firms
coming
in
there.
and
they
say
that
when
a
national
firm
comes
into
an
area
where
it
is
not
previously
familiar,
what
the
national
firm's
officials
generally
do
is
they
pay
great
weight
to
the
balance
sheet
of
the
banks,
they
don't
know
anything
about
these
banks,
they
have
to
select
a
bank
in
which
to
deposit
their
funds
and
traditionally
they
look
around,
they
want
to
get
the
largest
bank.
this
is
understandable
of
course
because
the
federal
deposit
insurance
company's
insurance
is
limited
to
$10,000.
so
in
one
of
these
big
firms,
it
makes
very
substantial
deposit,
they
want
to
be
able
to
look
and
see
that
they
have
a
powerful,
a
strong
healthy
institution.
and
thus
each
of
these
individuals
testified
that
the
very
size
of
the
bank,
the
fact
that
it
is
three
times
bigger
than
the
next
that
it
has
50%
of
the
market,
that
fact
itself
is
a
powerful
magnet
in
attracting
new
business
to
the
bank.
now
in
addition,
the
size
would
permit
the
new
bank
to
do
various
things
which
would
give
it
a
competitive
advantage
over
some
of
the
smaller
banks.
for
example,
most
of
the
banks
spend
a
great
deal
of
money
in
advertising.
this
is
one
of
the
most
vigorous
ways
in
which
they
compete.
traditionally,
the
amount
they
spend
on
advertising
is
directly
related
to
the
amount
of
their
deposits,
and
so
having
more
deposits,
being
a
bigger
bank
is
able
to
spend
more
on
advertising
and
thus
get
a
competitive
advantage.
there
are
other
things
for
example
that
the
new
bank
being
large,
it
would
be
in
a
better
position
to
put
in
automated
equipment,
they
will
be
better
able
being
a
larger
bank
to
hire
more
specialized
personnel.
and
now
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
would
like
to
discuss
a
question
you
raised,
what
the
significance
of
having
95%
of
the
trust
businesses.
the
witnesses
discuss
that
at
considerable
detail.
the
first
thing
they
pointed
out
is
that
trust
business
and
commercial
businesses
are
reciprocal
sources.
in
other
words,
if
you
have
a
large
active
trust
department
this
helps
you
in
obtaining
commercial
business
and
conversely
if
you
have
a
large
commercial
business,
this
helps
you
in
obtaining
trust
business
and
the
record
indicates
that
it
was
the
extensive
trust
business
of
security
trust
company
which
enabled
it
to
move
ahead
so
rapidly
in
the
commercial
field.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
wouldn't
fix
that
mr.
justice
because
while
they
are
interrelated,
they
do
play
a
part,
i
would
still
think
that
for
many
purposes
the
trust
business
does
have
sufficiently
identifiable
characteristics
to
make
it
an
appropriate
sub-mark,
but
i
say
i'm
now
arguing
to
try
to
show
why
within
the
broader
market
the
trust
business
has
a
related
significance.
there
was
another
point
that
was
made
by
the
witnesses,
is
that
this
combined
bank
with
its
95%
of
the
trust
assets
in
the
community
had
among
other
things
a
very
substantial
portion
of
the
choice
downtown
real
estate
and
this
they
said
gave
it
something
of
an
entrée
in
getting
the
commercial
business
of
the
tenants
of
this
property.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
just
don't
know
that
mr.
justice.
i'm
sorry
i
don't
know.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
only
in
the
–
on
the
really
conclusively
findings
mr.
justice.
the
district
court
in
this
case
did
not
make
detailed
finding.
the
district
court's
opinion
is
very
short
and
he
did
make
of
course
the
ultimate
finding
that
this
would
not
restrain
competition.
to
that
extent
that
has
to
be
overturned,
but
i
don't
think
there
are
any
specific
findings
in
the
sense
of
the
--
finding
that
there
was
no
conspiracy,
there
is
not
that
type
of
finding.
this
case
is
somewhat
unusual
in
that
the
district
court's
findings
and
opinion
occupying
only
about
six
pages
of
the
printed
record
and
one
other
little
--
just
a
little
fact
on
the
trust
business
is
the
effect
of
the
merger
was
to
give
this
bank
control
of
the
only
newspaper
in
town
which
had
previously
been
in
the
hands
of
trust,
in
the
hands
of
security
trust
and
now
it's
now
in
the
hands
of
the
merged
bank.
now
the
testimony
went
beyond
this,
however,
because
all
of
these
witnesses,
these
three
bank
officials
testified
that
the
size
of
security
trust
now
gave
it
such
an
advantage
that
the
other
banks
might
well
have
to
consider
a
merger
in
order
to
be
able
to
compete
effectively
against
the
economic
power
of
security
trust.
in
this
market
the
number
of
banks
has
dropped
from
19
--
in
1929
there
were
10
banks
in
the
area,
at
the
time
of
this
merger
there
are
only
five
as
a
result
of
this
merger
and
that's
what
we
have,
it
seems
to
us
in
this
small
city
in
central
kentucky,
is
a
confirmation
of
the
broad
trend
to
a
concentration
in
banking
which
this
court
noted
last
term
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case,
and
indeed
there
is
dramatic
evidence
in
this
case
of
the
danger
which
we
think
this
merger
poses
in
terms
of
further
accretions
of
concentration.
the
second
largest
bank
in
the
city
is
the
citizens
union
bank
which
had
roughly
17%
of
the
business.
the
citizens
union
bank
is
itself
the
product
of
a
merger.
in
1954
two
of
the
other
banks
merged
to
form
this
merger
and
the
president
of
the
citizens
union
bank
testified
that
he
principle
reason
for
this
merger
was
that
so
that
it's
bank,
this
new
bank
could
compete
more
effectively
with
the
first
national
bank
which
was
then
the
largest
bank
in
town.
now
with
this
--
this
is
the
factual
situation
as
it
existed
and
as
the
result
of
the
merger
and
we
think
that
these
facts
show
that
the
consolidation
constitute
a
combination
and
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade
and
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
as
i
have
indicated
on
this
phase
of
the
case,
there
is
no
issue
as
to
either
the
relevant
product
market,
commercial
banking
or
the
relevancy
of
graphical
market
and
the
question
before
the
court
is
thus,
what
the
effect
of
this
merger
had
on
competition.
we
rest
our
case
on
two
perhaps
related
propositions.
first
proposition
is
we
think
under
the
so
called
railroad
merger
cases,
this
merger
was
bad
because
it
resulted
in
the
elimination
of
substantial
competition
between
the
two
merging
companies.
secondly,
we
say
that
even
if
it
does
not
violate
that
standard
that
under
the
standards
enunciated
in
this
court's
latest
decision
dealing
with
horizontal
mergers
under
section
1,
the
columbia
steel
decision,
this
merger
must
fall.
now,
let
me
just
briefly
refer
to
the
railroad
cases.
we've
set
them
forth,
discussing
them
at
considerable
length
in
our
brief.
these
were
a
series
of
cases
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
century
in
which
this
court
had
before
it
combinations
of
railroads,
they
were
mostly
transcontinental
railroads,
and
these
cases
the
court
condemned
as
violations
of
both
section
1
and
section
2
apparently
of
the
sherman
act,
a
combination
of
railroads
which
eliminated
substantial
competition
between
the
merging
roads
themselves
and
in
reaching
--
making
these
holdings
the
court
did
not
look
to
see
what
was
the
share
of
the
market
not
controlled
by
the
other
railroads,
did
not
consider
how
effective
the
remaining
competition
was.
and
one
of
the
leading
cases
for
example
was
the
union
pacific
railroad,
where
this
court
struck
down
the
union
pacific's
acquisition
of
a
controlling
share
in
the
southern
pacific.
the
court
recognized
that
the
business
for
which
these
two
carriers
were
competing
was
only
a
comparatively
small
part
of
their
total
traffic,
but
it
nevertheless
found
that
there
was
a
substantial
amount
of
competition
between
them,
because
they
had
competed
for
million
of
dollars
worth
of
trade.
and
in
the
columbia
steel
case
of
course
this
court
said
that
the
railroad
cases
were
not
that
controlling
and
so
they
were
distinguishable
on
their
facts.
however,
this
court
has
never
questioned
the
authority
of
those
cases
and
indeed
it
cited
them
apparently
with
approval,
last
term,
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case
for
the
proposition
of
the
sherman
act
does
apply
to
horizontal
mergers.
we
think
those
cases
sound
and
we
think
they
basically
rest
on
a
self
evident
economic
proposition,
which
is
it
there
can
be
no
more
complete
restraint
of
trade
than
the
combination
of
two
independent
companies
that
are
competing
with
each
other.
when
you
have
two
competitors
that
are
combined
immediately
and
forever
all
competition
between
them
terminates,
that's
the
end
of
it.
as
far
as
the
marketplace
is
concerned
there
is
no
competition.
so
that
it
seems
to
us
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
if,
and
if
mr.
justice,
if
the
two
merging
companies
are
themselves
engaged
in
substantial
competition
between
them.
we
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
there
was
substantial
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
if
there
were
more
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
they
were
sufficiently
large
i
would
say.
if
you
had
two
shoe
stores
in
lexington,
kentucky
each
of
which
had
several
million
dollars
in
business
a
year,
i
would
say
i
would
think
that
would
be.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
then
i
say
it
has
to
be
viewed
in
the
light
of
course
of
the
whole
picture,
the
whole
picture.
if
you
had
two
shoe
stores
each
to
which
did
$10,000
worth
of
business
a
year
and
they
combined,
i
wouldn't
think
that
was
violation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice
let
me
suggest
on
that,
that
there
are
a
number
of
other
aspects
of
this
problem.
i
know
that
section
7
was
intended
to
go
beyond
this
type
of
problem
and
to
reach
other
types
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
limited
mr.
justice
i
would
suggest
to
the
case
where
you
have
horizontal
merger
between
competitors.
now,
there
are
many
areas
which
obviously
this
rule
that
we
are
suggesting
would
not
apply.
now,
just
briefly
in
this
case
to
point
out
that
there
is
no
question
that
the
two
banks
were
vigorous
and
strong
competitors.
each
had
been
developing
and
increased
their
share
of
the
market
and
certainly
it
could
not
be
again
said
that
in
this
area,
the
share
of
first
security
roughly
--
no
the
share
of
security
trust
roughly
13%
and
20
odd
million
dollars
in
deposits
is
a
substantial
amount.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
mr.
justice
no,
and
the
court
found,
the
district
court
found
that
the
defendants
had
not
engaged
in
any
predatory
act.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
i
don't
think
so
and
we
are
not
challenging
the
court's
finding.
we
do
say
however
that
the
absence
of
any
predatory
purpose
doesn't
in
any
way
favor
this
merger.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
there
is
no
claim
here
of
any
predatory
or
any
attempt
or
purpose
on
the
part
of
these
people
to
restraint
competition.
now,
i'd
like
now
to
turn
to
the
columbia
steel
decision
and
we
have
set
forth
at
page
35
of
our
brief,
the
quotation
in
which
this
court
explained
the
factors
which
it
they
deemed
pertinent
for
testing
the
validity
of
this
merger
and
the
court
said
that
the
dollar
volume
itself
is
not
of
compelling
significance
and
then
–
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
page
35
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
indented
paragraph
on
the
bottom.
it
said
rather
we
look
to
six
items,
the
percentage
of
business
controlled,
the
strength
of
the
remaining
competition
whether
the
action
springs
from
business
requirements
or
purpose
to
monopolize
the
probable
development
of
the
industry,
consumer
demand
and
other
characteristics
of
the
market.
now
this
inquiry
is
very
similar
we
think
to
any
inquiry,
the
kind
of
inquiry
that
the
court
traditionally
makes
in
a
case
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
it's
basically
we
think
an
enquiry
to
the
effect
of
the
merger
on
competition
generally
as
distinguished
from
what
i
have
been
just
suggesting
the
competition
just
between
the
acquired
and
the
acquiring
companies.
that
of
course
as
this
court
explained
in
the
brown
shoe
case
was
one
of
the
basic
changes
made
when
congress
amended
section
7.
it
shifted
the
emphasis
from
the
competition
between
the
acquiring
and
the
acquired
companies
to
the
competition
generally
in
the
marketplace
and
we
think
therefore
that
it
is
appropriate,
as
this
court
has
itself
recognized,
in
testing
the
legality
of
a
horizontal
merger
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
to
give
full
account
and
to
give
consideration
to
the
standard
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
and
therefore
we
believe
that
when
we
have
a
merger
which
plainly
violates
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
where
the
affect,
the
restraint
on
competition
is
very
clear,
we
think
this
goes
a
long
way
also
to
establish
that
it
constitutes
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade.
and
i
will
therefore,
when
i
now,
shall
now
turn
and
discuss
these
various
factors
mentioned
in
columbia
steel
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
wouldn't
say
--
we
recognize
of
course
that
not
every
violation
of
section
7
is
a
violation
of
section
1,
and
so
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
degree
mr.
justice.
we're
always
suggesting
is
that
you
can
properly
look
to
what
the
considerations
in
this
case
are.
in
considering
the
effect
on
competition
of
this
merger
you
can
properly
compare
this
to
the
situation
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case,
and
as
i
shall
attempt
to
demonstrate,
we
think
that
here
this
is
a
much
stronger
case
than
the
philadelphia
bank
case
and
therefore
we
think
that
since
this
would
plainly
violate
the
standards
of
the
philadelphia
bank
case,
that
is
a
very
significant
element
in
showing
that
it
also
violates
the
standards
of
section
1.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
well
we
have
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
but
this
is
a
part,
seems
to
--
this
is
a
part.
the
policy,
the
basic
congressional
policy
which
section
7
reflects,
the
policy
of
concern
over
the
rising
trend
of
concentration
that
we
think
this
is
appropriate
to
consider
in
looking
to
the
effects
of
this
merger
on
competition
under
the
somewhat
stricter
standards
of
section
1.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no
mr.
justice.
you
have
in
fact
–
well,
the
court
has
frequently
stated
that
the
two
statutes
are
complementary,
and
in
the
columbia
steel
case
they
suggested
that
the
policy
of
section
7
illuminates
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
violation
and
we're
not
saying
that
the
standards
are
the
same,
we're
just
saying
that
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
yeah
certainly
i
mean
we
have
to
proof
more
here,
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
degree.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
we
did
but
those
doubts
were
resolved
by
this
court.
now
on
--
let
me
if
i
may
i'd
like
to
discuss
the
various
factors
which
the
court
said
discussed
in
columbia
steel
and
point
out
why
we
think
that
under
those
standards
this
merger
does
run
afoul
of
section
1.
the
first
standard
is
percentage
of
business
control.
here
the
evidence
was
that
they
controlled
more
than
50%,
that
they
had
more
than
90%
of
the
trust
business,
and
that
the
trust
business
was
an
important
element
in
developing
the
commercial
business.
so
that
in
this
case
the
share
of
the
market
held
by
the
merging
banks
is
roughly
50%
greater
than
the
share
of
the
market
held
in
the
philadelphia
bank.
the
second
question
is
the
strength
of
the
remaining
competition.
well,
the
merged
bank
as
i
have
indicated
is
at
least
three
times
as
large
as
the
next
largest
bank.
it's
six
times
as
large
as
the
remaining
bank
and
in
the
trust
field
is
28
times
as
large.
in
the
philadelphia
case,
the
two
combining
banks
were
less
than
twice
as
large
as
the
next
bank.
so
once
again
what
we
have
here
is
the
two
merging
firms,
have
a
very
substantial
advantage
over
the
next
one.
the
third
thing
is
whether
the
action
springs
from
business
requirements
or
purpose
to
monopolize.
since
i
advised
mr.
justice
harlan,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
any
predatory
purpose
in
this
record.
on
the
other
hand,
the
district
court
did
find
that
the
banks
were
healthy
and
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
this
merger
to
protect
the
depositors
or
the
stockholders
of
the
banks,
and
i
will
in
a
moment
come
to
the
business
justifications,
which
the
defendants
have
suggested
for
the
merger.
i
might
just
say
in
anticipation,
we
don't
think
those
are
sufficient
justifications
to
validate
the
merger.
the
fourth
item
is
the
probable
development
of
the
industry.
here
again,
we
have
a
record
of
an
increase
in
concentration.
the
number
of
banks
was
cut
by
50%
in
a
period
of
less
than
35
years.
the
presidents
of
the
three
other
banks
testified
that
they
would
have
to
consider
margining
in
order
to
meet
the
economic
power
of
this
bank
and
that
finally,
one
of
the
leading
banks
in
the
community
was
itself
a
product
of
a
merger
whose
purpose
was
to
compete
more
effectively
with
the
big
bank.
the
fifth
item
is
consumer
demand.
now
the
merger,
the
elimination
of
a
strong
and
vigorous
bank
took
place
at
a
time
when
this
community,
this
area
was
undergoing
a
remarkable
economic
growth
and
when
as
the
federal
deposit
insurance
company
stated
in
it's
report
to
the
comptroller
of
the
currency,
that
the
merger
had
an
adverse
effect
on
competition,
there
was
a
strong
demand
for
credit
in
the
area.
and
finally
the
less
(inaudible)
of
other
characteristics
of
the
market
we
think
here
the
fact
of
the
bigness
of
the
bank
in
this
particular
market
attracting
other
customers,
the
advantages
possessed
by
the
trust
business
and
so
on.
i
now
like
to
turn
to
the
justifications
which
the
appellees
have
offered
for
this
merger.
basically
their
justification
is
that
the
larger
bank
will
be
able
to
obtain
deposits
from
two
new
sources.
first
they
say
being
a
larger
and
stronger
bank
they
will
be
able
to
obtain
deposits
from
these
large
corporations
coming
into
the
area
which
they
have
hitherto
not
been
able
to
obtain.
secondly,
they
state
that
being
larger,
they
will
be
able
to
obtain
from
the
country
banks
and
the
surrounding
area,
the
so
called
correspondent
deposits
which
they
have
hitherto
been
unable
to
obtain
and
as
large
volume
as
they
had
hoped
and
which
have
been
going
to
larger
cities
such
as
cincinnati
and
louisville.
and
the
argument
then
is
that
having
this
additional
cash
in
the
way
of
deposits
in
the
bank,
and
as
a
result
of
an
increase
in
the
bank's
capital
due
to
combining
the
two
banks,
this
will
enable
them
to
make
greater
loans
and
this
will
benefit
to
the
community.
now
we
have
a
number
of
answers
to
this,
the
first
answer
is
as
far
as
increasing
of
the
capital
is
concerned
the
record
shows
there
are
other
methods
by
which
a
bank
may
increase
it's
capital
than
merging
with
a
competitor.
they
can
issue
stock.
it
has
been
done
by
some
of
the
banks
and
there
was
testimony
that
--
one
the
witnesses,
one
of
the
defendant's
witnesses
that
he
thought
this
bank
could
have
sold
stock.
they
can
transfer
some
of
their
undivided
profits
to
surplus
and
thus
increase
their
capital
and
increase
their
individual
loan
limit.
and
as
far
as
making
larger
loans
are
concerned,
these
can
be
made
through
participation
with
the
correspondent
banks
because
just
as
some
of
the
smaller
banks
maintain
deposits
in
the
lexington
banks,
so
the
lexington
banks
in
turn
maintain
deposits
with
larger
banks
and
the
larger
citizens.
but
basically
we
think
this
argument
comes
down
to
the
contention
that
because
this
merger
will
be
beneficial
to
the
community,
because
it'll
help
banking
in
the
community
this
somehow
validates
it.
now,
really
we
think
this
is
basically
the
same
argument
which
was
made
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case
in
which
this
court
rejected
in
philadelphia
bank
case.
the
argument
is
frequently
made
in
anti-trust
cases
that
what
has
been
done
is
valid
because
it's
serving
a
legitimate
commercial
purpose.
for
example
in
the
fashion
originators
guild
the
argument
was
made
that
what
was
there
been
done
was
all
right
because
it
was
necessary
to
prevent
style
piracy.
and
we
think
that
when
conduct
as
this
kind
of
a
merger
has
what
is
to
us
a
demonstrated
anti-competitive
effect.
it
doesn't
lose
it's
anti-competitive
consequence,
because
of
the
fact
that
in
other
areas,
in
other
aspects
of
the
economy
there
maybe
certain
beneficial
advantages.
now,
the
legal
argument,
the
legal
argument
that
is
made
here
basically
is
that
the
fact
and
i've
referred
to
this
earlier,
the
fact
that
the
share
of
the
market
which
the
first
national
bank
had
some
20
years
ago,
at
that
time
it
was
50%
and
in
the
intervening
period
it
has
dropped
to
roughly
40%.
the
argument
is
that
this
decline
in
the
shares
of
the,
of
the
old
bank
indicates
that
having
this
kind
of
a
share
of
the
market
does
not
in
fact
cause
any
injury
to
competition.
that
smaller
banks
are
able
to
compete
despite
the
size
of
the
large
bank
and
then
of
course
the
stress
point
is
also
made
that
this
is
confirmed
according
to
the
appellees
by
the
statistic
showing
that
in
the
10
months
since
the
merger,
the
merging
bank's
share
of
the
market
has
declined
slightly
1%
to
2%
as
i
have
indicated
on
that.
there
was
evidence
that
this
is
not
unusual
and
was
anticipated.
now,
the
record
doesn't
show
why
in
a
20-year
period
the
first
national
bank's
share
of
the
market
dropped
from
roughly
50%
to
roughly
40%.
we
don't
know
whether
the
conditions
that
existed
in
this
market
at
that
time
are
comparable
to
those
today.
we
do
know
and
the
record
shows
that
at
the
present
time,
the
competing
banks
are
very
much
concerned
at
the
increase
in
the
power
of,
the
economic
power
which
this
bank
would
have
as
a
result
of
the
merger.
and
as
far
as
it
can
be
told,
as
far
as
this
record
shows,
what
has
happened
is
that
in
the
20-year
period
since
the
first
national
had
50%
of
the
market,
it
dropped
as
little
as
10
points
presumably
as
a
result
of
normal
competitive
process,
this
is
competition.
you
may
have
one
share
of
the
market
and
if
you
don't
competitive
effectively
you
may
not
be
able
to
hold
it
and
we
think
that
if
this
one
thing
that's
clear
under
the
antitrust
laws
is
that
when
you
lose
part
of
your
market
through
the
normal
processes
of
competition,
if
you
want
to
get
that
share
of
the
market
back,
you
have
to
get
it
back
through
competition
and
you
can't,
having
less
than
10%
through
competition,
get
the
10%
back
by
buying
up
one
of
your
competitors.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
opponent
has
criticized
the
witnesses
that
the
government
presented
the
presidents
of
the
three
banks
on
the
ground
they
just
testified
as
to
general
apprehension
and
concern
and
there
was
also
a
suggestion
that
the
witnesses
hadn't
testified
given
facts
to
backup
their
concern.
i
would
first
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
page
201
of
the
record
in
which
mr.
clarke,
the
president
of
the
second
largest
bank
to
whom
my
opponent
–
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
clarke.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
is
the
president
of
the
citizens
union
bank,
the
second
largest
bank
in
town
and
he
is
speaking
of
the
difficulties
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
he
is
speaking
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
201
mr.
chief
justice,
he
is
speaking
of
the
difficulties
of
attracting
deposits
from
large
corporations
as
against
what
first
national
and
security
were
able
to
do
prior
to
the
merger
and
he
was
asked,
“what
affect
on
competition
this
would
have?”
and
he
answered
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
“well
as
i
said
a
minute
ago,
i
think
the
treasurers
of
national
corporations
are
unduly
influenced
by
size.
it
was
difficult
enough
with
the
largest
bank
in
town
having
40%
of
deposits.”
in
other
words
he
said
that
even
before
the
merger
they
were
having
trouble
competing.
i
think
it
will
be
that
much
more
difficult
with
the
largest
bank
having
between
52%
and
53%
of
the
deposits.
i
think
it
is
a
sort
of
progressive
influence
and
then
previous
to
that
on
page
199,
he
had
echoed
this
thought,
made
it
a
little
earlier
when
he
was
asked
what
effects
will
the
increased
size
of
the
consolidated
bank
have
on
the
ability
of
your
bank
to
compete
and
his
answer
is
the
long
paragraph
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
and
that
halfway
through
that
quotation
he
said,
“my
experience
in
soliciting
accounts
of
national
concerns
is
that
size
has
a
tremendous
influence.
it
is
hard
to
understand
it,
but
it
does
on
the
decisions
of
treasures
of
national
corporations
as
to
the
bank
of
their
choice
in
a
community
where
they
have
a
branch
or
an
operation
of
some
kind.”
and
he
went
on
and
he
said,
“there
are
also
--
there
are
certain
local
people
who
wanted
to
do
business
with
the
biggest
institution.”
then
also
i
might
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
page
249
of
the
record,
where
mr.
clarke
in
reference
to
the
suggestion
that
at
the
–
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
249,
reference
to
the
suggestion
that
the
witnesses
were
unable
to
point
to
any
harm
they
had
suffered
in
the
year
from
the
time
of
the
merger
to
the
time
of
the
trial.
he
said,
about
the
sixth
or
seventh
line,
mr.
clarke
stated,
“i
have
stated
all
through
my
testimony
that
my
apprehension
is
over
the
long
run
not
the
immediate
effect.”
and
we
think
that
in
this
record
there
is
clear
and
definite
proof,
testimony
by
these
other
bankers
giving
facts
as
to
the
reason
why
they
would
be
under
a
competitive
disadvantage.
now
to
us
it
in
no
way
refutes
that
testimony
because
bankers
in
other
cities,
not
lexington,
bankers
in
other
cities
testified
that
in
their
view
they
did
not
have
any
difficulties,
they
are
competing
with
a
larger
bank,
because
we
don't
know
what
the
situation
is
and
it
seems
that
if
witnesses
testify
to
a
certain
situation
in
city
a,
it's
quite
immaterial
we
think
that
witnesses
in
another
city
testify
that
there
they
do
not
have
the
adverse
affect.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
lexington
they
testified
that
they
would
have
the
adverse
effects.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think
there
are
several
answers
to
that
mr.
justice.
first
the
situation
seems
somewhat
different
today
than
it
was
at
that
time.
first
of
all
at
the
present
time
--
at
that
time
there
was
no
indication
that
the
largest
bank
first
security
had
anywhere
near
this
percentage
of
the
trust
business.
in
fact
first
national
had
only
gone
into
the
trust
business
in
1940.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
what
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
strongly
deny
mr.
justice
that
they
would
be
unable
to
divest
and
let
me,
let
me
start
by
saying
that
the
same
argument
of
course
could
be
made
in
case
under
section
7
and
the
government
has
been
unfortunately
singly
unsuccessful
in
its
attempts
to
obtain
preliminary
injunctions
in
bank
merger
cases.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
we
have
just
recently
a
few
months
ago
unable
to
obtain
an
injunction
attempt
to
stay
in
the
crocker-anglo
case
and
the
manufactures
hanover
case,
the
banks
were
merged
one
hour
before
we
filed
our
application
for
a
preliminary
injunction.
so
that
the
problem
is
a
recurring
problem
and
if
in
fact,
if
in
fact
the
confirmation
of
the
merger,
the
day
before,
hours
before,
conceivably
minutes
before
the
government
files
its
suit
means
that
this
the
end
of
any
relief,
it
just
seems
to
me
an
impossible
situation,
but
i
like
to
come
to
this
very
case.
first
of
all
as
my
opponent
has
conceded,
these
people
received
letters
on
the
10th
of
january
approximately
a
month-and-a-half
before
the
merger
that
the
government
had
told
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
that
the
merger
would
have
an
adverse
effect
on
competition
and
that
we
were
further
looking
into
it
and
we
also
had
told
that
we
had
recommended
it
be
disapproved.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
was
on
january
10th
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
found
out
that
the
comptroller
had
occurred
–
i'll
have
to
go
outside
the
record
on
this
mr.
justice,
we
found
out
the
comptroller
had
approved
it
the
day
before
we
filed
our
suit.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
sent
us
formal
notice
in
the
form
a
letter,
a
very
short
letter
which
we
received
the
day
before
and
as
soon
as
we
found
out
about
it
--
i
found
out
about
it
we
sent
man
to
lexington
to
file
the
suit.
now
i
think
it's
very
significant
in
this
connection,
what
happened
on
the
motion
for
the
preliminary
injunction?
we
filed
the
motion
the
day
after
we
filed
the
suit
and
in
supporting
papers
we
set
forth
at
considerable
detail
at
pages
23
to
33
of
the
record
affidavits
by
various
local
bankers
as
to
the
difficulties,
the
difficulties
that
would
exist
if
after
consummation
there
had
to
be
divestiture,
we
recognize
it
will
be
difficult,
but
we
don't
think
it's
anywhere
near
impossible,
it
will
be
difficult
and
our
opponents
here
opposed
that
motion
and
the
--
we
think
this
record
makes
it
quite
clear
that
both
the
district
court
and
the
appellees
recognized
that
if
the
government
ultimately
should
prevail
in
this
suit
that
they
would
have
to
separate
these
banks.
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
two
passages
in
the
record.
the
first
is
at
page
43,
about
four-fifths
of
the
way
down,
the
last
statement
of
the
court,
and
the
court
says
there,
these
people
have
had
ample
notice
that
your
suit
has
been
filed.
they
have
had
ample
notice
of
what
the
results
maybe
if
they
continue
to
carry
out
a
so
called
merger.
they
would
have
to
stand
the
damage
that
would
be
occasioned
by
having
to
make
a
segregation
of
all
assets
that
are
commingled,
that
was
the
court
speaking.
then
at
page
77
mr.
park,
counsel
for
the
appellees
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
page
stated,
i
may
say
at
this
time
that
we
recognize
the
possibility
that
at
the
end
of
litigation,
we
may
have
to
restore
these
banks
to
their
former
status
and
we
recognize
that
for
our
own
protection
we
must
do
everything
that
we
can
to
keep
the
assets
segregated
and
identifiable
so
they
can
be
restored,
that
we
expect
to
do,
that
is
what
the
appellees'
counsel
tells
the
district
court.
the
district
court
entered
an
order
which
had
two
sections
to
it.
i
just
like
to
call
this
to
the
court's
attention.
the
district
court's
order,
the
so
called
order
directing
them
to
keep
separate
books
and
records
is
set
forth
at
pages
71
to
73
and
the
order
is
basically
in
two
parts.
on
page
72
paragraph
two
states
until
further
orders
of
the
court
the
defendants
shall
insofar
as
maybe
reasonably
possible
under
the
national
banking
laws
and
in
accordance
with
sound
banking
practices
keep
and
maintain
it's
assets
et
cetera,
et
cetera
in
such
manner
that
in
the
event
of
consolidation
is
ultimately
to
be
dissolved,
the
consolidated
banks
will
be
able
to
divide.
then
the
order
goes
on
in
paragraph
three
with
seven
specific
provisions,
directing
them
what
they
ought
to
do
and
then
in
paragraph
four
it
says
the
orders
shall
continue
in
full
force
in
effect
until
further
orders
of
the
court
and
the
court
reserved
the
right
to
make
any
modification
or
supplemental
orders
that
maybe
necessary
from
time
to
time
in
the
premises.
the
first
government
knew
that
these
defendants
had
not
complied
with
this
order,
was
roughly
three
weeks
ago
when
we
read
it
in
their
brief.
we
had
assumed
all
the
time
that
they
were
complying
with
this
order.
in
fact,
we
told
this
court
both
in
our
jurisdictional
statement
and
in
our
brief
that
even
though
the
order
had
expired
apparently
upon
the
completion
of
the
trial
that
they
were
continuing
to
observe
it.
we
are
now
told
for
first
time
that
they
not
complied
with
this
order
and
i
would
think
that
at
a
minimum
in
face
of
this
order
if
they
found
it
as
they
say
impossible
to
comply
with
that
they
at
least
should
have
gone
before
the
court
or
given
us
notice.
perhaps
if
we
were
told
that
this
segregation
of
the
assets
cannot
be
continued
it
might
have
been
possible
to
have
had
a
speedier
trial,
i
don't
know,
but
it
just
seems
to
us
in
all
these
circumstances
that
the
claim
that
because
it's
now
going
to
be
difficult
to
unscramble
the
assets
that
is
reason
why
this
court
should
nevertheless
presumably
refrain
from
decided
the
case
in
the
government's
favor,
we
find
this
the
most
unappealing
argument
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
was
a
--
security
was
state
bank
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
don't
know
enough
frankly
about
what
the
technicalities
were
under
state
law,
but
what
happened
it
was
there
was
an
agreement
of
consolidation
entered
into
under
the
banking
laws
and
in
effect
i
suppose
they
issued
new
stock
in
this
consolidate
company.
i
assume
the
stock
was
not
issued
between
the
board
of
directors
meeting
early
in
the
morning
and
between
the
opening
of
the
bank
that
day.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
as
i
understand
it,
the
main
office,
the
former
main
office
of
the
security
trust
company
is
now
the
security
trust
office
of
the
first
national
bank.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
assume
so,
i
just
don't
know,
i
don't
know
that
the
record
shows
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
don't
know
whether
they
could
they
couldn't
have
rolled
back
the
corporate
structure,
but
i
would
have
thought
they
could
have
deferred
taking
any
further
steps
toward
implementing
the
merger
i
would
think
at
a
minimum,
that's
all
really
we
asked
them
to
do,
they
had
merged
and
we
say
all
right
you
have
merged
but
at
least
freeze
the
thing
in
the
situation
so
that
there
is
divesture.
now
in
contrast
to
this
situation
i
think
it's
striking
contrast
to
what
happened
in
the
philadelphia
case.
in
the
philadelphia
case
we
did
file
our
suit
before
the
merger
had
taken
place
and
the
parties
voluntarily
withheld
any
action.
we
did
not
get
a
stay
there.
they
agreed
to
withhold
pending
the
determination
of
the
case.
here
they
just
went
ahead
and
insisted
on
consummating
the
merger
as
fully
as
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
february.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
28th.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
i
don't
know
--
of
course
the
record
doesn't
–
we
don't
anything
about
the
phone
call.
let
me
point
out
also
to
mr.
justice
i
believe
the
25th
was
a
friday,
the
28th
was
--
no
the
25th
was
a
saturday,
the
28th
was
a
monday
--
no
i
am
correct,
the
first
the
day
of
the
merger
was
on
a
wednesday
and
they
got
their
notice
on
28th.
they
got
their
notice
from
the
comptroller
or
by
telephone
at
the
end
of
the
previous
week,
they
got
a
telegram
the
day
before
they
consummated
the
merger
and
of
course
one
other
thing
is
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
we
did
not.
comptroller
did
not
tell
us
that
he
had
approved
this
merger,
and
of
course
the
fact
that
they
were
authorized
to
merge
by
the
comptroller,
they
were
authorized
to
merge,
it
doesn't
mean
they
had
to
merge.
they
could
have
held
off
the
merger
at
that
time
had
they
seen
fit.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
there
was
none,
because
under
the
law,
the
law
requires
us
to
advice
the
comptroller
of
our
views
on
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
he
did
not,
and
i
might
also
mention
mr.
chief
justice
that
here
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case
not
only
the
attorney
general
but
also
the
federal
deposit
insurance
company
and
the
board
of
governors
of
the
federal
reserve
system
made
adverse
recommendations
to
the
comptroller
on
this
merger.
i
would
also
like
just
very
briefly
mr.
chief
justice,
you
raised
the
question
as
to
the
situation
in
birmingham
as
to
the
concentration
of
the
trust
business,
the
record
is
not
entirely
clear
on
that,
but
the
record
i
think
–
makes
--
indicates
that
the
largest
bank
in
birmingham
had
nowhere
near
95%
of
the
trust
business.
i
would
like
to
invite
your
attention
to
page
681
of
the
record.
this
is
a
deposition
of
mr.
hurley,
if
i
may
just
finish
this?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon,
mr.
hurley
h-u-r-l-e-y,
who
was
the
trust
officer
of
the
alabama
bank
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
681.
now
here
they
gave
some
figures
when
he
was
asked
to
the
relative
size
in
the
middle
of
the
page
and
he
indicated
that
the
largest
bank
in
birmingham
had
a
total
of
200
million
to
225
million
trust
assets
and
the
second
largest
bank
had
between
80
and
100
million.
so
on
its
face
that
it
would
seem
to
suggest
that
at
most
largest
bank
in
birmingham
had
65%
which
is
quite
different
from
the
95%,
which
we
had
in
this
case
in
which
the
witnesses
testified
did
give
a
substantial
advantage
to
the
merging
bank.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
difficulty
is
in
competing;
well
there
are
two
affects,
one
affect
is
the
possibility
that
was
suggested
that
the
other
banks
might
have
to
merge
and
secondly
although
it's
not
shown
by
the
record,
it
seems
that
it
is
self
evident
proposition
that
what
you
have
done
is
eliminated
once
source
of
credit
for
people
there
instead
of
there
being
six
sources
to
which
they
may
turn,
there
are
now
five.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
think
so
under
our
theory
of
case
because
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
so
our
theory
of
the
case
would
be
that
the
mere
grabbing
of
this
additional
percentage,
the
mere
accretion
is
enough,
of
course
your
honor
just
to
reiterate
that's
not
this
case.
i'm
sure
your
honor
understands
because
here
we
do
have
some
evidence.
now
if
five
years
from
now
the
presidents
of
the
other
banks
had
testified
that
in
fact
it
hadn't
hurt
them,
that
might
be
quite
a
different
case
in
terms
of
the
(inaudible),
we'd
still
i
think
the
arguing
the
case,
but
i
don't
think
i
have
to
take
on
that
problem
because
here
there
is
we
think
clear
evidence
in
the
case
and
i
might
just
like
to
suggest
one
other
thing
if
i
may
mr.
justice
white
on
this
business
of
the
alternative
sources
of
credit,
that
specific
argument
that
there
would
be
alternative
sources
of
credit
available
to
most
of
the
borrowers
and
therefore
no
injury,
was
specifically
discussed
and
rejected
by
this
court
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case
at
page
367
of
its
opinion
where
it
said
equally
little
weight
we
think
of
the
assurance
offered
by
appellees
witnesses
that
customer
dissatisfied
with
the
services
of
the
resulting
bank
may
readily
turn
to
the
40
other
banks
in
the
philadelphia
area,
we
think
it's
similarly
irrelevant
that
customers
who
maybe
dissatisfied
with
the
merged
bank
may
turn
to
one
of
the
four
other
remaining
banks.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
because
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think
it's
because
of
the
very
nature,
the
very
nature
of
what
the
antitrust
laws
are
designed
to
protect
as
competition,
and
when
you
eliminate
a
significant
source
to
which
a
customer
can
turn,
that
is
an
elimination
of
competition,
that
does
injure
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
under
this
analysis
mr.
justice,
the
testimony
for
example
of
mr.
jennings,
mr.
jennings
the
principal
witness
who
had
also
testified
in
philadelphia
bank
case,
he
suggest
that
as
long
as
there
were
three
sources
available,
as
long
as
any
customer
had
a
choice
among
three
banks
that
was
adequate
competition.
well
this
means
you
could
just
keep
combining
and
combining
until
you
got
the
point
where
you
had
three
banks
–
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
we're
not
at
that
point.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
this
is
a
sherman
act
case
but
i
suggest
mr.
justice
that
the
possibility,
the
possibility
of
--
shown
in
this
record
that
the
banks
may
have
to
consider
merging
in
order
to
get
equal
to
able
to
develop
power
is
the
factor
to
be
considered,
it
may
not
to
be
entitled
to
its
great
weight
as
in
a
clayton
act
case,
but
i
think
it
is
the
fact
that
it
cannot
be
overlooked.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
court's
decision
was
rounded
on,
in
the
philadelphia
bank
on
the
day
that
probable
jurisdiction
was
noted
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
yeah
it
was
--
see
july
17th
it
was
almost
a
year-and-a-half
after
the
trial
and
roughly
almost
a
year
after
the
decision.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
mr.
justice
that's
at
pages
892
and
893
of
the
record.
there
are
two
parallel
letters,
one
to
each
bank.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
yes
we
do.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
there
is,
there
is
this,
the
only
evidence
i
can
point
to
is
the
evidence
that
there
is
apparently
in
this
area,
no
source
of
credit
outside
of
the
community
on
contrast
to
the
philadelphia
situation.
there
was
testimony
by
our
banker
witnesses
that
in
a
city
like
lexington
realistically
the
only
source
of
credit
the
local
businessman
has
is
the
local
banks
because
those
are
the
only
areas
where
he
is
known,
where
people
can
evaluate
his
credit
standing,
his
reliabilities.
so
there
was
–
candidly
there
was
no
testimony
by
customers
saying
that
we
would
like
to
have
a
six
bank,
but
it
seems
to
us
self
evident
that
if
you
have
a
relatively
small
number
of
banks
anyhow
and
you
eliminate
an
important
one
this
does
significantly
narrow
the
alternatives
available
to
the
customer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
standard
set
of
what
--
as
i
understand
it
the
two
banks
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
just
don't
know
that
mr.
justice.
i
would
suppose
that
i
would
just
assume
normally
that
the
probate
court
would
set
the
same
standards
for
all
of
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
just
to
the
banks
charge
issue.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
just
don't
know
that
mr.
justice
whether
--
we
do
know,
we
do
know
for
example
that
there
are
variations
in
the
interest
rates
they
charge.
they
all
have
roughly
comparable
service
charges
of
number
of
items
and
so
on.
i
would
--
they
should
presumably,
unless
there's
been
some
understanding,
each
bank
should
set
its
own
charges.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
record
doesn't
show
that
i
would
–
i
would
assume
there
was
because
of
the
fact
they
were
both
in
this
business,
they
were
both
prior
to
the
merger
rendering
corporate
to
fiduciary
services.
although
in
candor
i
have
to
say
that
was
relevant,
a
small
part
of
their
business.
