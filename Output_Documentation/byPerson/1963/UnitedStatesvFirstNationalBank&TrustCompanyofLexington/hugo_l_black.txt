had
any
notice
from
the
government
or
the
banks
of
the
filing
of
the
suite
on
the
day
of
the
merger?
justice
hugo
l.

what
i
meant
was
had
the
government
been
notified
of
this,
had
there
been
any
talk
about
it
according
to
the
record
or
it
just
come
like
bolt
out
of
the
blue?

relationship
between
the
two.
congress
has
decided
that
it's
unreasonable
restrain
of
trade
to
merge
under
the
condition
set
out
in
section
7.
it
decided
by
itself
that's
an
unreasonable
restrain
of
trade.
the
evidence
here
clearly
showed
that
it
was
a
kind
of
merger
the
congress
had
said
in
a
statement
was
an
unreasonable
restrain
of
trade,
but
it
is
your
argument
that
the
court,
the
court
could
find
different
than
congress
have
said
about
those?
justice

then
under
that
situation
there
would
be
an
unreasonable
restrain
of
trade.
justice
hugo
l.

the
sherman
acts
makes
the
policy
of
this
country
that
you
will
have
no
unreasonable
restrain
of
trade.
the
clayton
act
comes
along
and
says
that
mergers
of
this
kind
against
the
law
which
seems
to
me
and
they
say
that
it's
an
unreasonable
restrain
of
trade
and
against
the
policy
of
the
other
country.
it's
a
little
difficult
for
me
to
see
why
is
the
evidence,
if
it
were
conceded
as
evidence
or
precisely
enough
to
justify
action
under
section
7,
we
shouldn't
recognize
the
fact
that
congress
has
declared
that
we
are
not
using
the
words
unreasonable
restrain
of
trade,
but
it's
done
in
pursuant
to
that
policy.

no,
i
didn't
understood
your
--
i
understood
the
argument
was
leading
up
to
that
point.

hundred
and
what?
