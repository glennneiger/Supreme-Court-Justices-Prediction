mr.
robert
m.
odear
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
members
of
the
court,
distinguished
counsel
for
the
opposition.
as
i
listened
to
the
argument
of
distinguished
counsel
for
the
opposition,
i
could
not
help,
but
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
what
they're
attempting
to
do
or
ask
this
court
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
apply
the
clayton
act
test
to
a
sherman
act
case.
now
in
getting
to
that
i
would
like
to
first
address
myself
to
a
question
which
mr.
justice
goldberg
asked
and
that
is
as
to
the
importance
of
the
decision
in
this
case
as
a
precedent,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
since
the
decision
in
the
philadelphia
case
that
there
is
practically
no
importance
precedent
wise
in
the
decision
of
this
case
and
therefore
it's
not
of
great
importance
to
the
government
or
the
department
of
justice.
that
is
not
true
if
you
turn
the
situation
around
because
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression
in
this
court.
on
the
proposition
that
here
is
a
bank
which
has
already
merged
and
has
operated
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
as
a
merged
bank
and
now
you
are
being
asked
to
adjudge
that
bank
guilty
of
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
on
proof
which
amounts
to
almost
nothing
more
than
percentage
of
concentration
without
any
proof
as
to
the
effect
of
that
percentage,
which
might
be
proper
and
a
clayton
act
test
which
we
submit
is
no
answer
at
all
in
the
sherman
act
test.
and
we
are
faced
on
the
other
hand
it
is
a
matter
of
grave
importance
to
us,
because
if
a
divestiture
should
ordered
and
that
is,
that
is
the
remedy
which
the
government
seeks
in
this
case,
it
puts
our
bank
in
small
community
of
lexington
in
a
position
that
no
banks
has
ever
been
in
before
and
it's
difficult
to
know
what
would
result
from
that.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
the
merger
was
effected
on
march
1st,
1961.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
sir?
mr.
robert
m.
odear
the
suit
was
filed
on
the
same
day
that
the
merger
took
place
if
your
honor
please,
later
in
the
day.
the
--
i
want
to
address
myself
to
the
proposition
of
the
time
schedule
a
little
later
on
if
i
may,
but
as
to
what
the
effect
of
ordering
a
divestiture
in
the
case
of
a
bank
which
has
merged
and
has
operated
for
a
considerable
period
of
time,
the
effect
of
that
would
be
appalling
and
i
like
to
quote
from,
for
you
very
briefly
if
i
may
from
an
affidavit
which
was
filed
by
my
good
friend
mr.
larry
williams
who
tried
this
case
for
the
government
in
lexington,
kentucky.
and
in
that
affidavit
which
was
filed
in
the
california
bank
litigation,
he
had
trust
litigation,
he
said
in
these
cases
where
the
merging
banks
have
merged
before
a
temporary
restraining
order
or
temporary
injunction
could
issue,
serious
problems,
insoluble
by
a
divesture
decree
may
have
been
created.
even
attempts
made
in
good
faith
to
separate
the
properties
and
accounts
of
merged
banks
pending
a
final
decision
on
the
merits
of
a
challenged
merger
cannot
avoid
inconvenience,
extreme
inconvenience
to
(inaudible).
now
that's
very
appropriate
in
this
case
because
at
the
outset
the
district
court
entered
an
order
directing
the
merged
bank
to
try
to
keep
separate
books
to
show
what
business
might
have
belonged
to
one
bank
and
what
business
might
have
belonged
to
the
other.
but
the
court
recognized
that
that
had
never
been
tried
before
and
might
be
impossible
and
so
he
(inaudible)
order
in
the
language
that
the
merged
bank
could,
should
do
that
insofar
as
it
could
do
it
in
conformity
with
banking
regulations
and
existing
laws
and
in
conformity
with
the
standards
of
good
sound
banking
and
we
have
tried
this
situation.
we
have
tried
to
keep
those
books
in
that
manner
and
it
has
proven
to
be
physically
and
absolutely
impossible
to
do
so.
so
that
language
from
mr.
william's
affidavit
is
very
appropriate,
he
is
right.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
yes,
not
on
the
day
of
the
merger,
no
your
honor.
the
situation
on
that,
i
might
as
well
go
into
the
time
schedule
since
you
are
interested
in
it.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
no
sir
it
did
not
come
just
like
bolt
out
of
the
blue.
now
let
me
address
myself
to
that
if
i
may.
this
application
for
merger
was
filed
in
the
later
part
of
1960
and
of
course
when
that
is
filed
with
the
comptroller,
the
justice
department
is
immediately
notified
and
they
are
immediately
are
under
the
duty
to
investigate
the
situation
as
to
the
competitive
effects,
which
might
result
and
the
affect
on
interstate
commerce
which
might
result
from
the
merger.
and
so
the
government
in
this
case
did
make
such
an
investigation
and
we
are
fully
cognizant
of
the
situation
long
before
the
merger
took
place,
when
they
filed
their
report
with
the
comptroller.
now
back
in
january
the
10th
the
banks
received
a
letter
from
the
justice
department
in
which
they
said,
we
are
looking
into
this
matter.
in
effect
they
said,
we
are
looking
into
this
matter
of
your
merger
and
if
there
is
anything
wrong
with
it,
we
are
going
to
let
you
know.
now
the
next
thing
we
knew
and
we
knew
that
the
department
of
justice
and
the
fdic
and
various
other
branches
of
control
were
supposed
to
file
reports
and
the
final
decision
of
the
comptroller
was
to
be
based
on
those.
we
didn't
know
whether
the
report
of
the
justice
department
was
favorable
or
unfavorable,
but
some
weeks
after
we
got
that
letter,
on
the
24th
day
of
february
of
1961,
we
received
a
telephone
call
from
the
comptroller's
office
advising
us
that
the
merger
had
been
approved.
we
had
no
reason
to
suspect
if
there
was
an
adverse
report
from
the
justice
department,
because
on
january
the
10th
they
have
said,
don't
you
contact
us,
we'll
let
you
know,
we'll
let
you
hear
from
us
and
we
had
heard
nothing
and
it
was
in
the
press
and
the
government
knew
that
it
had
been
approved
and
they
took
--
they
didn't
tell
us
that
we
shouldn't,
they
took
no
steps
to
stop
us
and
so
we
asked
the
comptroller
to
make
it
affective
on
march
the
1st
and
comptroller
acquiesced
in
that
and
did
make
it
affective
on
march
the
1st
this
merger
was
approved
at
the
same
time
that
the
philadelphia
merger
was
approved.
government
had
no
difficult
in
stepping
in
and
filing
their
suit
before
the
philadelphia
banks
merged
and
thereby
didn't
allow
them
to
get
themselves
and
not
only
themselves,
but
the
general
public
into
the
situation
which
we
would
be
faced
with,
of
trying
to
separate
these
merged
banks,
and
so
the
government,
they
knew
what
was
going
on
and
they
told
us
that
they
would
write
us
a
letter
and
let
us
hear
from
them
about
their
decision
in
their
matter
and
we
heard
nothing
and
we
went
on
in
normal
course
of
business
and
merged
on
the
1st
day
of
march.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
the
next
proceedings
in
the
litigation
were
that
the
government
attorneys
contacted
us
as
attorneys
for
the
bank
and
they
said
that
we
don't
--
we
are
going
to
make
a
what
amounts
to
an
ex
parte
motion
today
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
to
enjoin
you
from
going
any
further
with
this
proposition.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
that
was
on
the
first
day
of
march,
the
same
day
when
the
merger
took
place
and
when
the
lawsuit
was
filed.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
between
us
and
the
bank?
mr.
robert
m.
odear
no.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
no
except
the
communication
which
they
had
sent
us
on
january
the
10th
saying
that
were
investigating
it
and
would
let
us
know.
they
said
to
us
in
effect
that
while
we
are
not,
it
is
not
legal
notice,
you
would
happy
to
have
you
come
up
and
be
present
and
so
we
appeared
and
were
present
and
they
–
sir?
mr.
robert
m.
odear
on
the
first
day
of
march
yes
sir,
they
presented
to
the
district
court
the
ex
parte,
although
we
were
there
with
no
preparation
of
any
kind
and
without
any
notice
except
the
invitation
to
that
day,
they
presented
to
the
district
court
a
motion
for
a
temporary
injunction
and
the
court
asked
us
if
we
accepted
notice
and
would
it
be
an
ex
parte
proceeding
or
would
we
be
in
it
and
we
said
we
were
only
there
by
invitation
and
not
by
notice
and
were
not
prepared.
so
he
said
well
nevertheless
if
the
affidavit
supporting
this
motion
shows
that
any
irreparable
injury
might
occur,
the
court
be
inclined
to
consider
to
ex
parte
and
so
they
addressed
themselves
to
that
proposition
and
this
hearing
i'm
mistaken,
it
was
on
the
second
day
of
march,
the
day
following,
i'm
still
on
the
first,
i
was
in
error
there.
my
recollection
was
from
the
same
day,
but
it
was
the
next
day.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
yes.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
the
only
notice
we
had
on
the
first
it
was
that
heard
of
it.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
oh
yes,
i
think
they
contacted
us.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
yes
sir,
that's
correct,
after
the
merger
had
taken
place
but
on
the
same
day.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
you
see
your
honor
it
was
early
in
the
morning,
not
early
by
--
i
don't
mean
we
got
up
before
daylight
and
did
it,
but
it
was
to
it
was
our
intention
to
close
business
off
for
the
two
banks
as
of
the
end
of
the
month
and
to
start
them
--
start
the
new
bank
as
of
the
first
of
the
month
and
therefore
when
it
opened
its
doors
and
business
commenced
it
was
our
purpose
that
it
would
be
commenced
as
a
merged
bank
and
therefore
we
got
(inaudible)
to
do
it
on
the
first
and
took
the
necessary
steps,
got
the
notices
out
and
took
the
necessary
steps
with
the
board
of
directors
of
two
banks
and
so
forth
to
open
on
that
day,
and
later
in
the
day
the
government
filed
its
action
and
we
heard
of
it.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
yes,
that
all
--
mr.
robert
m.
odear
as
to
whether
we
did
that
physically
or
not,
i'm
sure
that
some
of
it
was
done
but
whether
it
was
completely
accomplished
on
that
day
i
wouldn't
be
able
to
say.
in
effect
two
original
banks
went
out
of
existence
on
that
day.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
yes
sir
that
is
--
mr.
robert
m.
odear
he
didn't
make
it
absolute
if
your
honor
please
what
i
said
a
moment
ago.
he
said
that
insofar
as
you
can
maintain
separate
records
compatibly
with
sound
banking
practices
and
compatible
with
the
rules
and
regulations
and
the
laws
governing
the
conduct
of
banking
you
do
that.
we
found
it
was
impossible
to
do
it
many
fields
of
the
bank's
activities
and
in
many
others
it
was
very
much
incompatible
with
sound
banking
practices.
as
a
matter
of
fact
just
for
example
there
were
checks
of
course,
printed
checks
on
this
security
trust
and
on
the
first
national
bank
and
by
trying
to
keep
separate
accounts
somebody
who
had
money
in
the
merged
bank
might
write
a
check
on
the
first
national
and
that
would
be
on
the
security
trust
in
these
records
and
these
check
would
get
sent
back
insufficient
funds
when
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
plenty
of
money
in
the
merged
bank
to
take
care
of
it
and
there
were
many
fields
where
it
mixed
us
up
so
that
it
was
just
not
in
accordance
with
sound
banking
principles
to
be
able
to
do
it.
in
others
we
had
continued
to
up
to
the
present
time
as
best
we
could.
we
have
given
bonafide
effort
to
fulfill
in
that
direction
of
the
court.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
exactly
sir,
exactly
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
exactly
we
would
have
abided
by
the
order
of
the
court.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
well,
it
would
have
been
a
different
situation
i
think
which
would
have
--
mr.
robert
m.
odear
if
that
had
occurred
i
think
we
would
have
probably
sought
permission
to
get
the
banks
separate
again
and
then
try
to
case
out
and
put
them
back
together
afterwards
which
would
have
relieved
us
from
the
situation
which
we
found
ourselves.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
how
is
that?
mr.
robert
m.
odear
yes
sir,
the
court
didn't
hear
it
on
that
ex
parte
hearing.
he
put
it
off
till
we
had
notice
and
we
did
go
back
and
appeared,
and
of
course
we
didn't
know.
it
had
never
been
tried
before
in
the
history
of
banking.
we
didn't
know
whether
we
could
practically
comply
with
that
order
or
not
until
we
tried
it
and
so
we
went
ahead.
as
the
court
said
we
might
as
merged
bank
and
tried
honestly
and
faithfully
to
do
that,
but
it
just
worked
out,
it
was
impossible
in
many
fields
of
bank.
now
getting
down
to
the
situation
of
whether
or
not
we
are
guilty
of
the
sherman
act
rather
than
addressing
myself
to
the
relief
in
case
we
are
and
that
is
the
main
issue
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
i
think
the
other
one
has
been
somewhat
relieved
by
the
justice
department's
concession
in
his
response
to
our
motion
that
they
are
not
asking
this
court
to
judge
a
divestiture
now,
they
are
merely
asking
this
--
well
they
are
asking
the
court
to
do,
but
they
wouldn't
object
if
this
court
didn't
judge
that,
but
would
send
it
back
to
the
take
proof
on
what
would
be
the
appropriate
remedy
on
all
the
circumstances,
but
even
that
puts
us
in
a
position
where
we
don't
know
what
might
happen
to
our
bank.
it
might
cost
a
run
on
the
bank,
except
we
have
no
crystal
ball,
we
don't
know,
it's
never
been
tested.
i
am
almost
at
2:30,
so
i
like
to
just
read
you
one
very
short
quotation
on
that
particular
problem
before
i
go
on
to
the
question
of
whether
the
sherman
act
has
actually
been
violated
here
or
not,
and
that
is
a
quotation
from
a
mr.
funk
who
is
an
eminent
writer
on
the
laws
of
banking
and
economics
and
in
a
work
entitled
antitrust
legislation
affecting
bank
mergers
here
is
what
he
had
to
say.
the
picture
of
an
attack
on
a
bank
merger
after
it
has
been
consummated
is
a
shocking
one.
public
confidence
in
the
institution
would
be
shaken
and
might
be
entirely
destroyed.
the
task
of
disentangling
the
two
components
of
the
merged
bank
would
be
almost
inseparable.
great
loss
might
result
to
the
shareholders
and
possibly
to
the
public
and
that's
what
we
are
up
against.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
this
honorable
court,
distinguished
counsel
of
government.
at
the
close
of
the
session
yesterday
there
had
been
two
questions
asked
to
me,
which
i
would
like
to
briefly
augment
my
answer
to
at
this
time.
mr.
justice
brennan
enquired
as
to
whether
or
not
the
justice
department
had
gotten
in
touch
with
the
bank
in
any
way
prior
to
the
actual
merger
of
the
banks
and
you
will
recall
that
i
said
that
january
the
10th,
we
had
a
received
a
letter
from
the
justice
department.
now
in
background
of
that,
very
briefly,
the
application
for
merger
was
filed
on
the
first
day
of
december
of
1960
and
in
that
the
banks
asked
for
permission
to
merge
on
january
17th
of
the
following
year.
all
of
the
necessary
approval
of
the
stockholders
and
the
board
of
the
directors
was
had
early
in
the
history
of
that
matter
and
on
the
10th
day
of
january
the
bank
received
a
letter
from
the
department
of
justice
in
which
they
informed
us
first
that
their
report
to
the
comptroller
had
been
adverse
on
the
question
of
the
competitive
affects
of
the
merger
itself.
and
then
--
mr.
robert
m.
odear
they
advised
us
that
their
report
to
the
comptroller
was
adverse,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
no,
that's
the
reason
i
am
going
back
to
clear
it
up
your
honor.
what
they
further
advised
us
was
though
to
this
effect
and
i'd
like
to
quote
from
the
letter,
the
department
also
advised
that
in
view
of
the
serious
anticompetitive
effects
of
which
this
consolidation
may
have
on
the
lexington
area
and
in
response
to
a
number
of
complaints
made
to
the
department
in
connection
with
the
matter,
it
has
initiated
an
investigation
to
determine
whether
such
consolidation
would
create
any
violation
of
the
federal
antitrust
laws.
in
other
words,
that
had
--
they
had
not
determined
that
question
-
which
is
the
one
before
us
and
the
letter
continued,
“as
soon
as
this
investigation
is
completed
we
will
inform
you
as
to
what,
if
any,
action
the
department
intends
to
take
with
respect
to
the
consolidation.
now,
the
only
thing
we
--
mr.
robert
m.
odear
that
was
january
of
the
10th.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
weeks
went
by
and
we
heard
nothing
and
finally
on
the
24th
of
february
we
were
advised
by
a
telephone
call
from
the
comptroller's
office
that
the
merger
had
been
approved
and
from
that
we
assume
that
whatever
difficulties
there
were
had
been
ironed
out
in
our
case
and
we
then
asked
the
comptroller
for
permission
to
merge
on
the
first
day
of
march.
on
the
25th
of
february
the
same
--
the
following
day
after
we
had
received
that
communication
and
i
might
note
that
on
the
24th
the
philadelphia
bank
was
also
notified
of
their
right
to
consolidate
in
the
opinion
of
the
comptroller,
the
following
day
the
government
filed
its
suit
in
philadelphia,
on
the
25th.
but
the
time
progressed
and
on
until
the
1st
of
march
and
we
in
answer
your
question
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
received
no
information
by
telephone,
letter,
otherwise,
none
at
all,
and
so
we
proceeded
to
merge.
the
first
information
we
had
that
the
justice
department
was
going
to
take
any
action
upon
us
was
after
the
suit
was
filed
when
the
united
states
marshall
served
the
summons
on
the
president
of
the
bank
–
mr.
robert
m.
odear
--
and
that
was
on
march
1st.
now
then
mr.
justice
white,
enquired
about
--
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
the
--
in
our
case
on
the
first
day
of
march,
following
the
merger
--
mr.
robert
m.
odear
i
said
in
the
philadelphia
case
the
approval
was
granted
by
the
comptroller,
in
the
lexington
case
and
in
the
philadelphia
case
on
the
same
day,
and
on
the
25th
the
day
following
that
the
government
filed
a
suit
in
philadelphia,
but
they
filed
no
suit
against
us
until
after
the
merger.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
if
the
suit
had
been
filed,
yes,
that's
exactly
what
i
wanted
to
answer
to
your
question.
it
would
have
been
quite
different
because
then
we
would
not
have
as
yet
merged
and
we
--
it
would
have
been
a
different
proposition
that
we
would
then
faced
with.
well
if
--
mr.
robert
m.
odear
that
would
have
probably
depended
on
the
whether
the
court
state
a
temporary
injection
or
not,
but
the
court
would
have
an
opportunity
to
have
sustained
such
an
injection
if
the
suit
had
been
filed
before
we
merged.
in
the
sense
it
was
filed
after
we
merged,
the
two
banks
had
gone
out
of
existence,
they
could
--
they
didn't
have
charters
to
operate
as
individual
banks
anymore
the
only
way
they
could
operate
was
as
merged
banks.
and
so
the
court
ordered
and
we
agreed,
so
they
are
only
saying
that
we
could
do
under
those
circumstances,
which
was
to
try
to
the
best
of
our
ability
to
keep
the
separate
records
and
i
won't
make
that
clarification
of
what
i
stated
yesterday.
now,
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
what
i
consider
to
be
the
real
and
possibly
almost
the
only
question
for
this
court
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
question
as
to
and
it's
a
question
which
was
decided
a
question
of
fact,
which
was
decided
on
the
evidence
by
the
trial
court,
namely
that
the
evidence
presented
at
the
trail
of
this
action,
did
not
sustain
the
position
of
a
violation
of
section
1
or
section
2
of
sherman
act.
now,
unless
the
decision
of
the
trial
court
on
that
issue
of
fact
was
clearly
erroneous
then
it
should
be
affirmed
and
in
order
to
be
able
to
answer
that
question,
i
see
no
escape
from
discussing
the
evidence.
the
distinguished
counsel
for
the
government
said
that
he
was
pitching
or
placing
their
case
on
the
testimony
of
three
live
witnesses
who
appeared
at
the
trial
of
the
case,
the
only
witnesses
introduced
by
the
government
and
the
statistics
which
were
in
the
form
of
the
exhibits,
that
is
the
total
of
the
government's
case.
now,
the
testimony
of
these
three
live
witnesses,
who
were
presidents
of
other
local
banks
in
lexington,
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
on
the
basis
of
expert
opinion
that
this
merger
would
and
had
created
an
unreasonable
restraint
on
trade
and
commerce.
all
that
they
said
and
as
this
was
found
by
the
trail
court
and
the
records
sustains
it,
all
that
they
said
in
effect
was,
that
they
were
apprehensive
or
they
feared
that
it
might
put
their
banks
in
a
position
where
it
would
be
more
difficult
for
them
to
compete
which
is
a
long
way
from
saying
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
in
their
opinion
it
did
constitute
an
unreasonable
restrain
for
trade
as
we
see
it.
but
they
gave
no
facts
on
which
to
support,
even
their
fears
and
their
apprehensions
and
i
had
the
opportunity
to
cross
examine
those
gentlemen.
yes,
you
may
your
honor.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
about
a
year,
it
was
tried
in
the
1962.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
february
the
1960,
almost
a
year
later.
the
banks
had
an
opportunity
to
observe
or
practically
speaking
a
full
year's
operation
with
the
merged
bank
operating
as
a
merged
bank
and
to
see
the
experience
which
to
place
there
from.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
yes.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
on
both
sides.
we
bloomed
this
discovery
and
which
was
--
mr.
robert
m.
odear
that's
correct.
we
suffered
no
delay
from
any
cause
except
the
necessity
of
both
sides
to
prepare
themselves.
one
of
the
three
witnesses
that
the
government
speaks
about
was
president
of
one
of
the
local
banks
mr.
clarke
and
in
testifying
on
cross
examination,
he
was
asked
these
questions
and
this
is
very
brief,
but
it
goes
the
heart
of
thing
and
here
is
what
he
said.
mr.
clarke
in
your
opinion
are
the
borrowing
needs
of
the
citizens
of
lexington
adequately
taken
care
of
at
this
time
by
commercial
banks,
this
is
after,
a
year
after
the
merger?
answer
-
i
think
they
are.
question
-
are
they
adequately
taken
--
were
they
adequately
taken
care
of
prior
to
the
merger
in
march
of
1961?
answer
-
i
think
they
were.
question
-
and
they
still
are?
answer
-
yes
sir.
question
-
in
your
opinion
has
any
worthy
borrower
with
a
properly
bankable
loan,
been
refused
to
have
his
loan
made
in
this
community
because
of
this
merger?
answer
-
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
clarke
further
testified
as
follows.
question
-
prior
to
the
merger
there
was
competition
between
the
banks
in
lexington
for
practically
all
the
facets
of
commercial
banking,
was
there
not?
answer
-
i'm
sure
there
was.
question
-
and
since
the
merger
there
has
continued
to
be
competition
for
all
those
same
facets
of
commercial
banking,
has
there
not?
answer
-
with
one
less
competing?
question
-
but
competition
has
--
competition
still
continues
to
exist
in
all
facets
of
banking?
oh
sure.
question
-
has
your
particular
bank
experienced
any
particular
difficulty
in
the
obtaining
of
new
business
or
deposits
or
other
facets
of
commercial
banking
since
the
merger
which
it
did
not
experience
prior
to
the
merger?
answer
-
i
haven't
been
able
to
see
much
change.
now,
testifying
in
these
philadelphia
case
that
same
witness
mr.
clark
from
lexington,
when
he
was
asked
by
government
counsel
as
to
the
effect
of
concentration
of
banking
facilities
upon
small
and
intermediate
borrowers
in
lexington
area,
mr.
clarke
said,
"i
think
the
banks
in
our
community
take
pretty
good
care
of
the
borrowers.
i
don't
think
any
deserving
customers
have
not
been
able
to
meet
their
needs.”
further,
as
to
the
effect
of
the
elimination
of
one
bank,
by
reason
the
merger
in
lexington,
mr.
clarke
--
mr.
robert
m.
odear
this
is
from
the
original
record
only
in
the
philadelphia
case.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
in
the
philadelphia
case
where
the
witness
was
talking
about
lexington.
it
is
not
in
the
record
in
this
case.
shall
i
refrain
from
--
completely?
mr.
robert
m.
odear
it's
a
record
in
this
court
your
honor.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
it
is
of
the
record
in
this
court.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
perhaps
not
sure
honor
and
i
won't
pursue
that.
now
in
the
lexington
case
and
this
is
in
the
record
and
i'm
reading
from
record
--
page
274,
this
was
from
the
testimony
of
another
one
bankers
mr.
stills.
question
-
in
your
opinion
carrying
that
a
step
further
mr.
stills,
if
there
is
a
person
in
lexington
who
has
need
for
a
good
bankable
loan
would
he
have
any
difficulty
in
finding
a
place
to
take
out
that
loan?
answer
-
no
i
don't
think
so.
question
-
before
this
proposed
merger
there
were
six
alternate
choices
where
he
could
go,
were
there
not?
answer
-
that
is
correct.
question
-
and
now
there
are
five?
you
know
of
any
occasion
where
a
borrower
with
a
bankable
loan
has
been
unable
to
place
it
one
of
the
five
present
alternate
choices?
answer
-
i
don't
know
of
any,
no.
now,
two
judges
commented
on
that
testimony.
the
trial
judge,
in
his
opinion,
stated
as
follows
and
this
is
the
record
page
1249.
in
addition
to
statistical
facts
shown
by
the
numerous
exhibits
filed
the
plaintiffs
introduced
as
witnesses
to
sustain
its
contention
only
in
the
presence
of
three
local
banks
who
expressed
considerable
fear
that
the
consolidation
would
result
in
serious
loss
to
other
banks
and
would
be
disastrous
to
some
of
them.
the
testimony
given
by
these
witnesses
seems
based
merely
upon
surmise
and
he
is
lacking
in
factual
support.
now
that
comment
by
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
is
very
similar
to
the
language
used
by
this
court
in
the
opinion
in
the
philadelphia
case
in
which
a
similar
type
of
testimony
was
being
discussed
by
this
court
and
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
in
writing
the
opinion
of
the
court
stated,
there
was
to
be
sure
testimony
by
bank
officers
to
the
effect
that
competition
among
banks
in
philadelphia
was
vigorous
and
would
continue
to
be
vigorous
after
the
merger.
we
think
however,
that
the
district
court's
reliance
on
such
evidence
was
misplaced.
this
lay
evidence
also
complex
and
economically
no
problem
as
to
the
substantiality
of
the
effect
of
this
merger
upon
competition
was
entitled
to
little
weight
in
view
of
the
witnesses
failure
to
give
concrete
reasons
for
their
conclusions,
and
--
mr.
robert
m.
odear
that
is
correct.
they
are
proceeding
solely
on
the
sherman
act.
the
complaint
alleges
--
mr.
robert
m.
odear
that's
correct
and
the
proof
was
directed
to
that
issue.
now,
in
addition
to
the
testimony
of
those
three
live
witnesses
which
was
based
not
merely
their
fear
and
apprehension,
a
conclusion
upon
which
they
gave
no
facts
whatsoever
to
support
and
which
this
court
has
said
was
therefore
entitled
to
little
weight,
we
have
the
statistics
offered
by
the
government.
most
of
the
voluminous
exhibits
filed
by
the
government
were
addressed
to
problems
which
no
longer
exist,
such
as
what
was
the
relative
market
and
should
competition
with
other
lending
agencies
be
involved
and
things
of
that
kind.
so
really
the
only
statistical
evidence
which
bore
on
this
particular
problem
was
the
statistical
evidence
which
show
that
following
the
merger
in
excess
of
50%
of
the
banking
assets
of
the
community
would
be
in
the
hands
of
the
merged
bank
and
also
the
exhibit
with
reference
to
the
concentration
in
the
trust
field.
now,
the
government's
statistics
and
figures
directed
themselves
to
what
existed
on
one
particular
day
only,
there
was
no
expert
testimony
offered
as
to
the
affect
of
that
concentration
on
competition
in
lexington,
kentucky,
there
--
no
expert
was
introduced,
no
attempt
made
in
evidence
to
explain
them
or
to
deduce
anything
from
that.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
that
one
day
was
as
the
close
of
business
in
1961,
1960,
end
of
1960
which
was
immediately
prior
to
the
merger
two
months
before
the
merger
took
place.
there
are
no
figures
available
as
of
the
first
of
march
and
so
they
took
the
figures
for
two
months
in
advance
of
that
which
was
the,
were
the
year
end
figures
and
it's
based
on
1960,
end
of
the
year.
now,
as
apposed
to
that
the
defendants
offered
exhibits
which
show
not
only
the
exist
--
the
condition
which
existed
on
a
day
two
months
prior
to
this
merger,
but
showed
number
one
what
had
happened
in
the
way
of
competition
between
these
banks
in
lexington
for
the
year's
operation,
10
months
of
which
was
after
the
merger
had
taken
place,
to
see
what
effect
on
competition
the
merger
had
had
in
lexington.
the
proof
on
that
show
that
that
the
time
of
the
merger
or
two
months
in
advance
thereof
that
the
merged
bank
held
52.7%
of
the
total
resources.
and
after
a
year
had
elapsed
in
competition
between
the
merged
bank
and
the
other
existing
banks
that
figure
had
gone
down
to
51%.
now
that
in
itself
might
not
be
too
significant
except
if
you
consider
it
in
the
light
of
what
had
happened
before
in
the
same
community,
lexington
community,
under
the
same
circumstances
where
the
lead
bank
had
in
that
case
more
than
52%
they
had
53%
plus
of
the
banking
assets
and
that
was
the
condition
in
1942
in
lexington,
the
first
national
bank
at
that
time
held
53.7%
of
all
deposits
in
lexington.
11
years
later
in
competing
with
the
bank
holding
that
amount
of
concentration,
the
smaller
banks
had
been
able
to
compete
so
well
that
they
had
grown
much
more
rapidly
than
the
lead
bank
and
the
lead
bank's
concentration
or
possession
of
assets
had
then
dropped
to
38.7%
and
so
you
can
sometimes
foretell
a
situation
by
what
has
happened
in
the
past
and
you
can
examine
the
situation
in
the
light
of
what
has
happened
in
the
past
under
practically
identical
circumstances.
we
didn't
stop
there.
we
introduced
evidence
which
showed
what
had
happened
under
similar
circumstances
in
other
cities
of
comparable
size
to
lexington,
not
philadelphia
or
new
york,
but
we
went
to
the
east
of
us
to
huntington,
west
virginia,
that's
the
first
city
of
comparable
size
of
lexington
that
you
come
through
going
in
that
direction.
there
the
lead
bank
had
held
75%
of
the
banking
assets
and
in
15
years
that
shrank
under
competition
with
the
other
banks
to
59%,
looking
to
the
south
at
chattanooga,
tennessee,
there
the
lead
bank
had
held
61%.
and
in
competition
over
a
short
period
of
time
with
the
other
banks
that
dropped
to
52%.
to
our
west,
louisville,
kentucky,
that's
a
larger
than
lexington,
but
it's
the
first
large
city
you
come
to
and
is
the
closest
want
to
us,
there
the
lead
bank
and
held
at
63%
and
in
competition
with
that
bank
the
other
banks
in
a
short
period
of
time
were
able
to
cut
that
down
to
53%.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
that's
total
resources
of
those
figures
were
based
on.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
the
loans,
there
are
figure
showing
the
loans,
but
i
don't
think
they're
in
those
other
cities
they're
just
in
lexington.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
we
do
have
them
in
chattanooga
but
not
in
huntington,
west
virginia
or
louisville.
now,
that's
what's
happened
in
our
neighboring
cities
that
are
comparable
in
size
and
situation
to
us
and
those
figures
are
in
the
record
and
we
think
those
figures
demonstrate
that
these
smaller
banks
are
just
as
able
to
compete
against
a
bank
of
that
size,
but
we
also
looked
at
the
situation
nationally
in
comparable
cities
and
we
found
that
and
this
is
a
defendant's
exhibit
89,
there
are
122
cities
in
the
united
states
in
1946
with
populations
of
between
50
to
100,000
population,
lexington
was
62,000.
and
in
those
122
cities,
66
of
those
cities
or
more
than
half
of
them
the
lead
bank
hell
more
than
50%.
in
122,
out
of
those
122
cities
35
of
them,
the
lead
bank
held
more
than
60%,
and
in
47
of
the
others
the
lead
bank
was
between
35%
and
50%.
now,
for
lexington
to
have
a
lead
bank
with
50%
where
more
than
half
of
the
other
cities
of
the
united
states
of
comparable
size
have
lead
banks
of
having
more
than
50%
seems
to
us
to
show
that
it
is
not
unreasonable
because
it's
not
on
unusual
it's
the
norm
that
is
the
average
situation
which
exists.
government
has
suggested
that
the
question
of
reasonable
be
determine
on
the
basis
of
tort
law
and
there
it's
what
is
usual
and
customary
and
what
do
you
expect
to
find
and
that
is
the
situation
in
--
throughout
the
united
states
and
cities
of
comparable
size
to
lexington,
kentucky
and
so
we
say
that
those
figures
are
very
indicative
themselves.
now
what
happened
in
those
cities
throughout
the
united
states?
well,
in
the
35
cities
throughout
the
united
states
of
comparable
size
where
the
lead
bank
held
more
than
60%
of
the
assets
over
a
period
of
a
few
years,
four
of
those
35
cities
they
--
lead
bank
gained
slightly,
in
two
of
those
cities
there
was
only
one
bank
so
it
couldn't
go
up
or
down
it
had
hold
the
business
to
start
with
so
you
have
to
eliminate
that.
in
29
of
the
cities
as
compared
to
four,
the
percentage
went
substantially
down
and
so
with
--
those
figures
are
indicative
and
are
a
basis
for
the
trial
court's
finding
in
this
matter.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
that's
exactly
right.
now,
in
lexington
if
you
compare
just
the
dollar
volume
over
a
period
of
years
when
the
first
national
bank
was
the
lead
bank
and
had
the
percentage
we're
talking
about
its
total
assets
went
up
$15
million.
and
over
a
similar
period
of
time,
a
bank
which
started
from
scratch
and
had
no
percentage
they
were
able
to
obtain
$12
million.
so,
while
the
first
national
got
3
million
more
than
they
did
was
an
insignificant
amount
in
view
of
the
ability
of
that
bank
to
grow
and
compete.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
yes.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
yes
your
honor
in
the
exhibits
they're
so
(inaudible).
so
that
is
a
brief
comparison
of
the
statistical
figures
offered
by
the
government
and
offered
by
the
defense
and
we
submit
that
produced
a
situation
in
the
evidence
which
were
warranted
in
the
trial
court
in
arriving
at
this
conclusion.
and
of
which
it
seems
to
us
it
would
be
improper
to
say
that
his
conclusion
was
clearly
erroneous.
i
would
like
to
compare
also
very
briefly
the
live
witnesses
offered
by
the
defendant
at
the
trial
of
the
case
with
the
three
live
witnesses
of
which
counsel
for
the
government
spoke.
we
went
to
some
of
these
other
cities
where
banks
had
been
competing
against
lead
banks
which
had
more
than
50%
of
assets,
banking
assets
of
that
community.
we
brought
them
there
from
huntington,
west
virginia
and
chattanooga,
various
other
cities
and
without
exception
and
these
were
not
men
who
ran
the
lead
bank,
these
were
bankers
who
were
in
the
smaller
banks
and
who
had
had
the
experience
themselves
of
competing
against
a
bank
which
have
more
than
50%
of
the
banking
assets
and
without
exception
they
said
that
it
offered
them
no
difficulty
in
competition,
that
they
were
just
as
able
to
compete
as
they
would
otherwise
be.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
we
do
not,
now
in
my
figures
about
the
122
cities
i
left
out
purposely
states
where
branch
banking
was
allowed
because
i
did
not
think
that
was
a
comparable
situation.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
county-wide
branch
banking,
we
do
have,
we
don't
have
state-wide
branch
bank.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
the
record
show
that
we
had
the
--
out
of
the,
merge
bank
has
five.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
before
the
merger
first
national
had
three
and
the
security
trust
had
two,
no
had
one,
pardon
me,
one.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
yes
your
honor
please,
in
birmingham,
alabama,
that
situation
existed
and
the
proof
in
the
record
is
that
that
did
not
create
a
situation
where
there
was
any
undue
advantage
to
commercial
banking
by
reason
of
that
fact.
i
want
to
talk
a
little
further
in
length
about
the
trust
business
in
just
a
moment
your
honor,
but
that
is
effective,
that
is
in
the
record
about
birmingham
and
we
took
that
proof
and
bought
it
to
the
court.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
i
think
it
was
brought
about
by
a
historical
development,
if
your
honor
please.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
in
the
last
new
bank
in
lexington
was
the
central
bank,
started
originally
as
central
exchange
and
that
was
in
1945.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
no,
it's
a
state
bank.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
security
trust
company
only
went
into
commercial
banking
around
1947
but
prior
to
that
time
they
had
been
almost
exclusively
in
the
trust
business.
so
that
during
that
time
there
had
been
two
that
have
entered
into
the
field
of
commercial
banking
in
lexington.
and
in
those
cases,
they
were
able
to
grow
and
compete
healthily
against
a
bank
which
had
50%
or
so
of
the
banking
assets.
now,
we
went
to
these
cities
as
i
say
and
brought
in
these
witnesses
who
testified
from
their
experience
which
makes
it
different
from
a
witness
giving
an
opinion
upon
which
he
has
no
facts
to
base.
they
had
the
fact
of
their
actual
experience
in
the
same
situation
on
which
to
base
their
opinion
and
they
gave
that.
now
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
were
66
comparable
cities
in
the
united
states
which
in
1946,
the
lead
bank
had
more
than
50%,
the
government
didn't
produce
one
single
witness
from
any
of
those
to
testify
that
there
was
any
adverse
affect,
banks
felt
thereby
reason
of
that
concentration.
the
record
is
absolutely
in
a
vacuum
on
that
proposition
except
for
our
testimony
which
is
of
course
that,
the
anti
competitive
effects
merely
from
concentration
in
a
city
of
a
city
of
the
size
of
lexington
those
not
accomplish
any
unreasonable
restrain
of
trade.
we
also
brought
two
experts,
a
professor
from
the
university
and
a
man
who
had
been
in
the
office
of
the
comptroller
and
who
had
acted
as
acting
comptroller
for
a
while,
both
of
them
well
qualified
in
the
field
of
economics
and
they
said
that
in
an
area
or
a
setting
like
lexington,
a
city
of
this
size
and
comparable
surroundings,
that
this
situation
would
not,
in
their
opinion
--
mr.
robert
m.
odear
if
your
honor
please,
in
the
bank
case
the
language
of
the
opinion
says
that
in
the
absence
of
clear
evidence
to
the
contrary
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
clayton
act
case,
that
30%
in
a
setting
like
philadelphia
is,
per
se
or
prima
facie
too
much
so
as
to
what
the
outcome
would
be
if
we
have
been
trying
this
case
under
the
clayton
act
would
be
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
that
evidence
clearly
showed
to
the
contrary,
but
we
had
no
such
burden
in
this
case
because
this
was
a
sherman
act
case.
you
are
not
dealing
with
what
--
mr.
robert
m.
odear
i
don't
think
it's
a
question,
if
your
honor
pleases,
of
the
court
finding
different
from
what
the
congress
said,
but
the
job
the
court
has
to
do
is
different
in
the
clayton
act
than
what
the
court
has
to
do
in
the
sherman
act.
and
if
there
is
testimony
in
a
clayton
act
case
that
this
situation
might
reasonably
be
expected
to
lead
to
a
diminution
in
competition
that,
then
its
duty
of
the
court
to
keep
that
from
happening.
that's
right.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
i
think
it's
not
a
matter
of
what
the
court
should
do
if
it
finds
certain
things
to
be
effect,
as
it
is
a
difference
of
the
type
of
evidence
that
is
necessary
in
order
to
establish
that
when
you
are
trying
a
clayton
act
case
and
when
you
are
trying
a
sherman
act
case
your
honor
please,
because
it's
a
different
test,
that's
to
be
applied.
if
this
merger
unreasonably
restrains
trade
then
certainly
it's
a
sherman
act
violation
and
that's
the,
that's
the
intent
back
of
both
the
acts
of
course.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
your
honor,
i
certainly
intended
to,
do
not
intend
to
concede
that
under
the
same
set
of
facts
that
this
would
be
a
violation
of
the
clayton
act.
if
your
honor
understood
me
to
say
that
--
mr.
robert
m.
odear
no,
the
point
i
was
trying
to
lead
to
was
this.
i
think
that
under
either
act
this
would
not
be
a
violation,
because
here
you
have
clear
evidence
to
the
contrary
but
that
would
be
the
question
the
court
would
have
to
decide.
while
in
the
philadelphia
case
you
did
have
this
percentage
of
concentration
and
no
evidence
this
court
found
which
was
--
upon
which
the
court
could
arrive
at
a
different
conclusion
and
therefore
the
court
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
say
there
was
a
violation,
but
here
in
the,
in
this
case,
we
do
have
what
i
consider
to
be
clear
evidence
to
the
contrary.
that's
the
differences
i
see
here.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
if
you
get
over
the
proposition
of
the
setting
in
which
it
lies
assuming
that
the
difference
in
the
setting
has
no
--
has
no
difference
in
it,
then
it
would
be
a
--
mr.
robert
m.
odear
my
feeling
is
that
that
would
not
have
necessarily
made
out
a
case
under
the
sherman
act,
because
the
type
of
evidence
which
is
necessary,
the
court,
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
it
takes
a
great
deal
more
evidence
to
substantiate
a
finding
of
violation
of
the
sherman
act
than
it
does
with
the
clayton
act.
and
therefore
although
the
prima
facie
test
which
you
apply
in
the
clayton
act
might
well
show
that
a
violation
existed
if
you
get
over
the
proposition
of
the
difference
in
the
setting
at
the
end
of
the
government's
testimony.
but
i
don't
think
that
will
necessarily
follow,
nor
follow
at
all
that
that
would
have
proved
the
violation
of
the
sherman
act
and
certainly
after
the
conclusion
of
the
evidence
of
the
defendants
we
think
the
evidence
is,
is
preponderant
on
our
side
and
would
well
warrant
the
finding
of
the
trial
court
that
there
was
no
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
and
of
course
you
have
decided
in,
i
think
in
the
times-picayune
case
that
if
the
government
proceeds
under
the
sherman
act
they
must
meet
the
rigid
tests
of
evidence
of
the
sherman
act,
and
they
have
chosen
the
weapon
and
they
can't
by
some
means
bring
themselves
under
the
clayton
act
unless
they
bring
the
suit
under
the
clayton
act.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
consider
the
clayton
act?
yes
i
think
it
should
be
consider
in
relation
to
the
sherman
act
but
i
think
it
should,
i
think
it
should
be
considered
in
the
proper
perspective
of
what
that
relation
is,
and
that's
been
very
well
defined
by
this
court
in
previous
decisions.
mr.
robert
m.
odear
i
think
that,
i
think
that's
what
this
court
held
in
the
times-picayune
case
that
its
--
mr.
robert
m.
odear
apply
the
sherman
but
--
mr.
robert
m.
odear
your
honor
i
think
that's
exactly
correct,
i
believe
that.
i
said
i
wanted
to,
i
see
my
time
is
almost
up,
i
certainly
want
to
talk
something
about
the,
this
trust
situation,
and
i'll
do
just
briefly
as
i
can.
trust
situation
in
lexington
enrolls
in
a
rather
unusual
manner
in
that
the
security
trust
company
for
a
long
time
was
the
only
corporation
which
offered
corporate
trust
services
and
their
clients
were
other
banks,
the
other
banks
helped
to
form
it.
and
they
held
100%
of
the
corporate
fiduciary
business.
proof
shows
that
about
20
years
ago
with
the
first
national
bank
decided
to
go
into
the
trust
business
and
they
were
able
to
compete
successfully
and
obtain
a
substantial
portion
of
the
trust
business
against
a
bank
which
had
a
100%
to
start
with.
now,
the
real
competition
in
the
trust
business
is
the
competition
against
individual
appointments
because
by
far
the
great
percentage
of
appointments
in
fayette
county
for
trustees
are
various
types
are
individuals.
over
a
21
year
period
--
we
made
a
study,
over
a
period
of
21
years,
individuals
received
91%
of
the
trust
apartments,
so
there
is
the
place
where
trust
business
must
come
from
and
where
you
must
compete
in
order
to
get
it.
trust
business
is
also
a
little
different
from
the
business
where
the
--
the
business
continues
and
you
get
the
same
customer
over
and
over
again
as
you
do
in
a
shoe
store
for
example
because
once
you
are
appointed
as
a
trustee
for
all
practical
purposes
there
is
no
competition
between
banks
to
take
that
appointment
or
that
particular
trust
away
from
one
bank
that
has
it
and
gave
it
to
another
one,
and
so
it's
in
a
--
really
in
an
entirely
different
field.
the
testimony
in
this
case
un-contradicted
that
kind
of
concentration
since
you
are
only
competing
for
a
new
business
and
not
against
each
other
for
the
business
you
already
have,
that
holding
that
percentage
is
no
detriment
to
competition,
it
doesn't
keep
another
bank
from
competing
that
has
been
born
out
by
the
fact
that
this
record
that
in
–
since
just
shortly
before
this
merger
took
place,
the
other
banks
who
had
formally
not
even
been
interested
in
getting
trust
business
went
into
the
field
and
have
been
able
to
get
it.
we
brought
an
expert
who
said
that
that
was
perfect,
natural,
and
normal
because
it's,
if
i
may
use
a
home
illustration,
it's
kind
of
like
going
fishing
and
you
arrive
at
the
pond
a
little
late
and
there
is
that
fellow
that's
already
caught
a
pile
of
fish,
you
don't
catch
the
fish
but
ones
–
and
the
fact
he
already
has
in
there
are
the
ones
he
has
got,
doesn't
keep
you
from
being
in
just
as
good
position
to
catch
fish
from
there
on
out
as
he
is
and
i
think
it's
comparable
to
the
situation
in
the
trust
business,
not
in
other
businesses
where
you
continue
and
you
compete
for
the
business
the
other
man
already
has,
you
don't
do
that
in
the
trust
business.
now
there
has
been
some
intimation
in
the
record
and
by
counsel
for
the
government
that
the
first
national
arrived
at
its
size
by
previous
mergers.
and
i
would
like
to
call
this
to
the
court's
attention
and
this
is
substantiated
in
the
record,
the
12
mergers
or
takeovers
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
them
which
the
first
national
bank
had
previously
had,
many
of
them
by
the
way
were
where
banks
were
about
to
go
under
and
--
well
the
last
one
in
1929,
the
fayette
national
bank
was
in
difficulty
and
the
government
asked
the
first
national
to
take
it
–
that
bank
over
so
that
the
depositors
wouldn't
lose
their
deposits.
but
after
all
those
12
had
been
accomplished
30
years
ago
and
there
has
been
none
since,
the
first
national
bank
was
only
$11
million
bank.
it
only
had
assets
of
$11
million.
so
it
did
not
get
its
growth
from
those
mergers.
the
security
trust
company
had
had
no
previous
merger
before
this
one.
i
have
--
my
time
up.
