justice

a
matter
of
fact
does
this,

white
how
many?
justice

(inaudible)
brought
under
section
7
and
had
been
decided
after
the
philadelphia
bank
decision
in
this
court
that
you
would
say
this
same
evidence
would
justify
the
decision
for
the
bank.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
at
the
close
of
the
government's
case,
at
the
close
of
the
government's
case,
in
a
section
7
case,
if
this
had
been
brought
under
section
7,
i
take
it
that
there
would
have
been
a
prima
facie
case
made
out,
if
the
case
had
been
tried
after
philadelphia.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
assuming
that
there
were
two
counts
in
the
complaint,
one
is
sherman
act
and
two,
section
7
and
at
the
close
of
government's
case
section
7
violation
is
then
made
out
prima
facie,
how
about
the
sherman
act
on
account
of
that
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
in
lexington?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
about
in
the
past
when
one
of
the
banks
had
a
large
amount
and
then
lost
as
years
went
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
the
evidence
in
the
record
showing
the
possible
consequences
of
this
merger
or
the
actual
consequences
other
than
the
affect
on
the
competitors,
the
other
banks
in
the
city?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
sole
--
going
to
be
the
sole
major
whether
there
is
a
restraint
of
competition
or
not,
the
affect
on
the
other
banks
in
sense
of
growth
or
deposits
or
loans.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
for
some
reason
this
--
the
trial
of
this
case
had
been
delayed
for
five
years,
and
it
was
shown
that
the
merged
bank
remained
--
retained
exactly
the
same
percentage
in
the
community
as
it
did,
that
is
as
it
had
the
day
after
the
merger
and
all
the
others
five
years
hence
also
retained
their
same
percentage,
all
of
them
had
grown
and
gotten
their
share
of
the
business,
would
that
be
of
any
real
relevance
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
nothing.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
suggest
that
the
possible
adverse
consequences
on
customers
is
a
legitimate
consideration?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
there
any
evidence
like
that
in
this
case
–
in
this
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
whether
there
is
a
standard
set
of
trust
fees
in
lexington.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
i
want
to
set
up
a
living
trust
and
i--
before
this
merger
i
went
to
one
bank
or
the
other.
is
there
any
difference
in
what
the
--
what
it
cost
me
to
have
my
trust
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
asking
about
a
probate
court,
i'm
talking
about
a
living
trust.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
i
was
a
corporation,
if
i
had
corporation
before
the
merger
that
i
have
two
places
to
go,
if
i
wanted
someone
to
act
a
transfer
agent,
you
know
what
–
whether
there
was
any
competition
between
the
banks
for
those
in
the
business?
