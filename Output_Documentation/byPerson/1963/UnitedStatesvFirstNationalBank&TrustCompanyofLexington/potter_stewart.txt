justice

stewart
exclusively
for
it's
oral
argument
then.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
there
a
simply
â€“
third
or
fourth
grade
addition
just
add
for
(inaudible)
39.83
plus
12.87.
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
again
52.7?
justice
potter
stewart
in
(inaudible)
--
the
statute
was
for
the
protection
of
the
other
banks
justice
potter
stewart
for
the
protection
of
competition
in
the
interest
of
the
public.
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
trust
business
the
subject
of
the
section
2
part
of
the
complaint?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
do
think
that
the
trust
business
is
a
separate
part
of
trade
and
commerce
from
commercial
banks.
justice
potter
stewart
like
these
are
manufacturing
companies
difference
between
ice-skates
and
shoes
or
something.
justice
potter
stewart
that
kind
of
distinction.
justice
potter
stewart
a
simple
theory,
which
of
course
what
you
say
is
actually
correct,
which
means
that
any
merger
is
a
per
se
violative
of
the
sherman
act
if
it's
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
potter
stewart
two
shoe
stories
in
a
town
where
there
are
100
shoe
stories
of
large
--
if
they
are
in
interstate
commerce
and
that's
a
violation
of
that
sherman
act.
you
are
very
simple
and
very
based
on
what's
undoubtedly
perpetually
correct
that
once
they
merge
the
competition
between
them
is
at
an
end
forever.
justice
potter
stewart
now
let's
say
they
were
in-vigorous
substantial
competition
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
they
are
right
next
to
each
other
in
a
town
in
lexington,
kentucky
and
there
were
15
other
shoe
stores
in
lexington,
and
these
two
merge,
that's
the
end
of
it,
that's
the
per
se
violation
of
the
sherman
act
according
to
what
you
have
said.
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
then
by
your
answer
you
are
conceding
that
there
maybe
some
other
relevant
considerations
in
determining
--
and
thus
the
simple
fact
of
a
merger
between
two
substantially
competitive
enterprises.
justice
potter
stewart
if
what
you
say
is
correct
of
course,
i
should
think
there
was
no
need
to
at
all
to
enact
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
justice
potter
stewart
you've
already
gone
so
far
that
you
swallowed
up,
you're
way
beyond
the
section
7
already
in
your
per
se
violation
if
you
had
two
substantial
competing
enterprises
merge.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
say
it
goes
a
long
way
tort
showing?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
like
to
saying
that
proving
a
person
is
guilty
of
manslaughter
goes
a
long
way,
toward
proving
is
guilty
of
first
degree
murder,
but
in
order
to
convict
him
of
first
degree
murder
you
have
to
go
the
whole
way.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
see
how
it
helps
you
here
to
show
if
you
can
show,
and
let's
assume
arguendo
that
you
can
show
that
this
was
violation
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
i
don't
see
how
it
may
go
a
long,
hard
way
or
a
long
way,
towards
what
you
need
to
prove
under
the
sherman
act,
but
under
the
sherman
act
you
need
to
prove
all
that's
necessary
to
prove
under
the
act,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
date
of
that
letter?
justice
potter
stewart
january
10th.
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
same
token
you
had
all
had
time
to
file
a
law
suit
too
before
the
merger
was
consummated?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
as
though
by
the
very
statutory
scheme,
it's
not
as
though
these
things
happen
without
notice
to
you,
the
justice
department
has
given
notice
under
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
why
is
it
irrelevant?
justice
potter
stewart
i
heard
what
you
said,
what
you
quoted
from
that
opinion,
but
that
opinion
didn't
say
why
it
was
did
it
and
why
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
as
if
it
does,
but
if
you
can
show
that
it
doesn't
then
it
doesn't?
