mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
mr.
chief
justice,
justices
of
this
honorable
court.
i
would
like
to
say
with
all
due
respect
to
colonel
deutsch
that
he
has
confused
the
facts
in
this
matter,
in
this
particular
case.
and
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
a
few
minutes
to
tell
you
exactly
what
the
facts
are
and
exactly
how
they
came
about
and
i'll
do
it
very
briefly.
and
i
think
that
you
will
find
that
the
record
bears
me
out.
where
the
defendant
in
this
case
robbed
the
district
attorney,
he
made
a
public
statement
that
these
fines
and
forfeitures
was
--
should
be
corrected.
after
he
took
office,
he
met
with
the
judges
and
this
is
in
our
supplemental
brief.
he
met
with
the
judges
and
discussed
the
matter
with
them
and
agreed
that
a
better
system
should
be
worked
out.
upon
the
misrepresentations
of
the
district
attorney,
the
defendant
in
this
case
to
one
of
the
retired
judges
over
the
payment
of
rob,
are
copied.
this
judge
wanted
verification
of
the
price
of
the
copy.
he
was
refused
the
approval
of
this
expenditure.
the
fines
and
forfeitures,
goes
into
a
fund
handled
by
the
district
attorney
in
orleans
parish.
in
order
to
get
money
out
of
that
fund,
he
sends
a
copy
of
it
and
hand
it
over
to
city
hall
which
is
approved
by
the
arbitrator
and
then
he
takes
it
to
one
of
the
judges
to
have
it
signed.
after
this
misrepresentation,
there
were
several
other
misrepresentations
and
this
is
all
brought
out
in
the
record
and
in
the
testimony.
so
the
judges,
in
order
that
they
were
--
couldn't
be
played
against
to
one
another,
they
met
and
adopted
this
so
called
5
by
8
rule.
now,
he
knew
all
this
at
the
time.
he
knew
it
when
he
campaigned,
he
knew
it
afterwards
and
he
knew
that
the
statements
he
was
making
about
being
a
--
so
called
being
a
black,
by
vice
and
so
forth
were
in
error
because
of
the
fact
that
from
the
time
that
they
met
with
the
5
by
8
rule
at
which
he
was
present,
the
judges
approved
some
close
to
$50,000
of
money
for
him
to
use
in
so
called,
vice
investigations.
in
addition
to
that,
he
had
12
policemen
assigned
to
him
by
the
chief
of
police
and
this
is
in
the
record,
who
were
paid
by
the
city,
not
out
of
his
payroll,
who
worked
at
his
direction.
therefore,
there
was
no
possible
way
that
these
judges
could've
blocked
any
investigation
that
he
made.
he
had
all
kind
of
money.
he
had
all
kind
of
personnel
including
his
own
investigators.
so
when
he
made
the
statement
that
they
blocked
his
investigators,
that
is
not
true
and
he
made
that
statement
deliberately
knowing
it
to
be
false.
now,
let's
talk
about
vacations.
he
said
that
they
weren't
working
that
the
jail
was
closed.
well,
the
district
attorney
in
the
state
of
louisiana
controls
the
docket.
he
determines
who,
where
and
when
they
will
be
prosecuted.
the
judges
have
nothing
to
do
with
that.
furthermore,
in
louisiana
courts,
just
as
this
court,
does
not
work
on
saturdays
and
sundays,
that's
104
days
out
of
the
year.
the
constitution
provides
--
its
courts
would
take
--
criminal
courts
would
take
two
and
a
half
months
vacation
which
is
another
75
days.
there
are
17
legal
holidays.
you
add
those
up
and
it
comes
to
196,
i
believe.
he
claimed
that
they
were
taking
206
days
vacation.
well,
they
had
to
take
197
days
vacation.
there's
no
that
they
can
do
anything
about
it.
and
i
think
that
this
court
realizes
and
appreciates
that
while
you
have
a
criminal
district
court
without
law
clerks
and
without
a
library,
that
it
certainly
going
to
take
them
some
time
in
addition
to
sitting,
to
look
up
the
various
legal
points
that
come
before
that
court.
now,
knowing
all
that,
he
became
irritated
apparently
to
retired
judge's
statement
over
the
question
to
this
rack
and
he
called
a
news
conference
on
november
the
2nd.
and
he
just
said,
"everything
in
the
world,"
but
the
chief
thing
that
he
said
was
that
"all
of
this
so-called
blocking
his
investigation
and
taking
vacations
and
so
forth,
that
this
raised
interesting
questions
of
racketeering
influence
and
no
other
questions."
now,
after
that
happened,
the
judges
filed
an
affidavit
against
him,
charging
him
with
defamation
under
the
same
statute
that
he
is
now
being
prosecuted.
he
had
one
of
his
assistants
walk
into
court
and
dismissed
that,
which
the
district
attorney
has
the
right
to
do.
now,
as
i
said
to
this
court
previously
and
i
stated
in
my
brief.
here
was
a
situation
where
judges
were
accused
to
being
racketeers.
and
i
agree
with
the
court,
on
one
of
the
justices
that
made
a
remark
that
if
he's
guilty
of
that,
he's
got
no
business
being
a
judge.
so
the
--
the
eight
judges
petitioned
to
me
because
i
have
authority
over
district
attorneys
to
come
in
and
prosecute
him
on
a
bill
of
information.
and
it
was
our
position
that
if
what
he
was
saying
was
true,
then
it
didn't
have
anyone
fit
to
hold
office.
so
i
filed
a
bill
of
information
because
i
thought
that
it
was
my
duty
and
i
had
to
do
it
because
that
is
the
only
way
that
the
state
can
prosecute
an
individual.
it's
got
to
be
done
in
the
name
of
the
state.
if
you
know
i,
if
i
walk
over
and
i
slap
you
and
you
filed
a
charge
against
me
for
simple
battery,
it's
got
to
be
in
the
name
of
the
state
because
the
state
stands
for
law
and
order.
you
can't
take
law
into
your
own
hands,
such
as
your
risk
as
about
seeing
he
cheats
at
the
golf
course,
what
does
that
man
going
to
do?
is
he
going
to
take
a
gun
and
go
kill
this
fellow?
you
can't
do
that
in
--
in
our
particular
society.
so
continue
--
continuing,
i
filed
a
bill
of
information
against
him
to
give
him
the
opportunity
to
prove
his
charges.
after
the
bill
of
information
was
filed
on
november
the
13th
to
22nd,
i
think
it
was.
he
made
a
speech,
a
catholic
school
meeting
in
new
orleans
and
he
went
through
the
same
charges.
he
accused
these
judges
of
being
influenced
by
racketeers.
he
says
there's
no
other
reason
and
he
said
that
he
was
going
to
keep
shouting
to
the
public
because
he
had
no
other
allies
because
the
other
public
officials
belong
to
the
association
of
armed
robbers.
and
incidentally,
in
the
meantime,
he
had
told
several
reports
all
of
which
is
in
the
record,
that
it
was
nothing
but
a
racket,
that
the
only
way
he
could
put
these
sacred
house
back
to
work
was
to
tell
the
public
about
it.
when
i
tell
you
that
the
record
bears
out,
that
he
knew
that
there
wasn't
any
truth
to
what
he
was
saying
and
that
he
didn't
have
any
reasonable
idea
or
remote
consideration
that
what
he
was
saying
was
the
truth.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that
what
your
honor?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no,
i
don't
think
so
because
i
think
that
that
statement
would
be
one
that
may
have
been
made
in
the
reason
for
this
or
the
truth.
now,
my
statute
provides
this,
that
defamation
is
a
malicious
publication
or
expression
in
any
manner
to
anyone
other
than
the
party
to
pay
him
of
anything
which
tends
to
expose
any
person
to
hatred,
contempt
or
ridicule
but
to
deprive
him
of
the
benefit
of
social
intercourse.
now,
it
provides
a
privilege.
an
actual
malice
must
be
proved,
regardless
of
whether
publication
is
true
or
false
in
the
following
situations,
where
the
publication
or
expression
is
a
comment
made
in
the
reasonable
belief
of
its
truth
upon
(a)
a
conduct
that
a
person
in
respect
to
public
offense.
now,
mr.
deutsch
was
talking
about
the
cox
case.
let
me
say
that
the
two
cases
on
the
docket
here,
this
(inaudible)
24
and
the
25.
one
involves
the
right
to
picket
in
the
city
of
baton
rouge
which
is
not
connected
with
this
case
at
all?
the
other
one
involves
the
right
to
be
issued
a
parade
for
in
it
by
the
city
of
baton
rouge,
which
doesn't
involve
this
case
at
all.
and
the
cox
which
was
decided
by
the
supreme
court
which
is
not
reported
and
i
looked
just
before
i
came
and
stopped
before
it
even
in
advanced
sheet.
he
was
charged
with
defamation
of
a
district
judge
for
this
reason,
that
he
said
it
was
common
knowledge
that
oppressed
negroes
who
appeared
in
judge
blodgett's
court
had
to
pay
a
fee
which
he
knew
it
to
judge
blodgett
benefit
to
keep
from
going
to
the
penitentiary.
now,
that's
what
he
was
prosecuted
for.
and
one
of
the
defenses
among
others
that
he
made
was
that
he
had
the
right
to
say
anything
he
wanted
about
a
public
official
because
he
was
protected
by
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
our
supreme
court
went
into
this
matter
very
thoroughly
and
here's
what
it
says.
it
says,
"we
cannot
agree
with
appellant
therefore
that
the
new
york
times
case,"
talking
about
the
sullivan
case,
"its
authority
for
holding
that
if
conditioned
that
the
publication
or
expression
must
be
made
in
a
reasonable
belief
of
its
truth,
the
privilege
to
apply
violates
to
constitutional
safeguards
in
the
first
amendment."
we
view
our
statute
as
being
fully
in
accord
with
the
new
york
times
pronouncement,
conceding
that
case
of
civil
libel
is
applicable
to
our
criminal
defamation
legislation,
and
it's
fully
safeguarding
those
accused
under
it
in
contravention
with
the
first
amendment.
our
statute
permits
the
qualified
privilege
to
exist
regardless
of
whether
the
publication
was
true
or
false
when
it
is
a
comment
made
in
a
reasonable
belief
of
its
truth
upon
the
conduct
of
a
question
in
respect
to
public
affairs
and
in
such
case,
actual
malice
must
be
proved
by
the
state.
our
criminal
statutory
requirements
for
proving
actual
malice
are
in
accord
with
those
set
out
in
the
new
york
times
case
for
civil
libel.
our
statute
is
clearly
constitutional
when
measured
by
the
standards
set
out
in
the
new
york
times
case
to
satisfy
the
first
amendment.
and
then
it
goes
on
of
course
arguing
arguendo
and
says
this,
"in
our
opinion,
our
statute
is
not
for
public,"
and
this
is
the
same
statute
that
he's
prosecuted
here,
"is
not
for
public
to
the
--
poignant
to
the
first
amendment
simply
because
it
recognizes
that
the
public
have
an
interest
in
the
maintenance
of
the
public
act
with
public
men."
public
affairs
could
not
be
conducted
by
a
man
of
honor
with
a
view
to
the
welfare
of
the
country.
if
it
taxed
upon
them,
it
could
be
made
at
will,
distracted
of
--
distractive
of
the
honor
and
character
and
made
wholly
without
foundation.
our
statute
sufficiently
protects
those
honestly
criticizing
the
public
officials
as
to
their
official
conduct
to
satisfy
the
first
amendment
when
it
properly
forbids
unjustified
malicious
attacks
upon
them.
and
may
i
remind
this
court
that
the
defendant
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh,
yes.
absolutely.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
in
other
words,
our
supreme
court
has
now
held
in
accordance
with
your
rules
that
in
the
prosecution
of
a
public
official
for
defamation,
actual
malice
has
to
be
proved.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
and
that
is
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that's
true
and
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that's
what
i
said,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no,
no
it's
not.
it's
just
a
question
of
fact
now.
it's
a
question
of
fact
as
to
where
the
actual
malice
was
proven
by
the
state.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
and
in
this
case,
in
response
to
a
bill
of
particulars.
he
asked
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
alright.
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.and
in
that
instance,
our
court,
that
is
why
i
read
you
the
cox
decision.
our
court
has
adopted
and
supported
the
new
york
times'
view,
that
now,
regardless
of
civil
or
criminal
prosecutions
that
when
you're
speaking
of
a
public
official,
actual
malice
is
an
essential
ingredient
of
the
crime
and
must
be
proved.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
actual
malice
that
it
was
made
with
ill-will,
that
it
was
made
to
expose
the
individual
to
hatred,
contempt
and
ridicule.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no
--
no.
absolutely
not
and
that's
why
this
case
is
distinguished
from
the
sullivan
case
or
the
new
york
times
case.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
the
factual
situation
here
is
entirely
different
from
the
new
york
times
case.
these
individuals,
public
officials
as
you
--
as
you
recall
the
sullivan
case,
weren't
even
mentioned
by
name.
and
in
the
sullivan
case,
one
of
the
officials
of
the
new
york
times
had
stated
that
he
had
looked
into
it
and
he
felt
that
he
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
it
was
true.
but
we've
got
a
different
factual
situation
here
in
the
garrison
case
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
right,
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
the
record
is
--
the
record
is
--
of
course
the
record
speaks
for
itself
your
honor
but
the
record
has
and
shows
actual
malice
and
that
he
knew
or
had
reason
to
believe
and
we
proved
that
--
about
the
vacations,
we
proved
about
the
vice,
we
put
the
chief
of
police
of
the
new
orleans
police
on
--
of
course
to
show
that
he
had
these
12
men.
we
put
the
judges
on
to
show
the
vouchers.
we
actually
put
the
vouchers
in.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
we
proved
statements
of
his
false
and
we
proved
that
they
were
made
with
malice.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes,
we
actually
told
him
that
we
were
going
to
prove
malice
in
law
and
in
fact
and
the
district
court
found
that
in
its
were
--
well-worthy
opinion.

jack

of
volume

the
findings
of
the
lower
court
of
the
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes,
it's
about
10
pages
devoting
to
malice.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
613,
starting
with
613.
it
starts
really
at
610
in
the
opinion
of
february
the
6th,
and
it
goes
on
through
and
is
devoted
--
about
10
pages
is
devoted
to
it.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
this
is
the
findings
of
the
trial
--
this
is
the
findings
of
the
trial
court.
well,
you
see
in
louisiana,
you
only
can
appeal
on
exceptions
which
are
taken
to
the
various
rulings
of
the
court.
and
the
lower
court
opinion
of
course
deals
with
it
but
the
--
the
details
of
actual
malice
are
found
in
this
opinion
by
justice
palmer
(ph).
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
honestly,
it's
too
long.
i'll
be
glad
to
read
it
for
you
but
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
now,
let
me
say
this
that
the
state
put
on
23
witnesses
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
and
the
defendant
called,
22
and
a
defendant
never
took
the
stand
which
is
not
to
be
held
against
him
and
i'm
not
urging
that
now.
and
he
didn't
call
a
single
one
of
his
witnesses
and
every
fact
that
the
state
of
louisiana
proved
was
absolutely
uncontradicted
and
is
there
without
any
contradiction
whatsoever.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
in
other
words,
it
says
that
you
have
a
qualified
privilege
where
the
publication
or
expression
is
a
comment
made
in
the
reasonable
belief
of
its
truth,
and
then
on
(a),
the
conduct
of
the
person
in
respect
to
public
affair.
so
yes,
i
agree
with
that.
i
definitely
agree
with,
and
i
call
to
your
attention
the
fact,
that
the
state
of
louisiana
in
this
case,
advice
the
defendant,
they
were
going
to
prove
malice
both
in
law
in
fact
and
actually
did
so.
and
now
our
supreme
court
has
come
along
and
absent,
the
various
thing
that
you
justices
are
speaking
about
now
and
i'm
going
to
have
a
copy
of
this
--
sufficient
copies
of
this
made
and
sent
to
you
and
i'd
be
very
happy
to
do
it.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
now,
i
only
have
this
one
copy.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i
don't
mean
that
i'd
be
glad
if
i
have
some
notes
over
here
which
are
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
this
receipt
relieved
me
of
the
necessity
of
sending
further
copies
in.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i
will
be
very
happy
to
do
so,
your
honor.
i
certainly
will
be
very
happy
to
do
so.
i
--
suppose
that
--
that's
all
i
can
see
in
this
particular
case
now,
except
to
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
in
greene
versus
united
states
which
is
cited
at
page
147,
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court,
this
court
held
that
criminal
--
the
theft
cases,
were
not
subject
to
jury
trial
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
right.
a
misdemeanor
in
our
law
is
defined
as
an
offense.
the
punishment
of
which
is
necessarily
a
fine
or
imprisonment
in
the
parish
jail
or
both.
and
in
this
particular
case,
i
think
the
maximum
fine
is
$3000
or
one
year,
and
incidentally
colonel
deutsch
in
the
cox
case,
they're
only
sentenced
to
one
year
and
he
eventually
had
failed
to
pay
the
fine,
not
due.
now,
we
of
course,
in
the
state
versus
hayden
which
is
cited
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
went
thoroughly
into
that
question.
and
our
supreme
court
has
found
that
as
long
as
an
individual
charged
with
a
misdemeanor
has
the
proper
guarantees
such
as
the
--
the
filing
of
a
bill
of
information,
the
right
of
cross
examination,
the
right
of
counsel
properly
in
time
and
so
forth
that
there
is
no
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights
and
that
misdemeanors
can
constitutionally
be
tried
before
judges.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no.
we
weren't
talking
about
--
the
court
wasn't
talking
about
libel.
it
was
talking
about
a
criminal
statute.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
my
answer
--
my
answer
to
that
of
course
is
that
there
is
no
violation
of
an
individual's
rights
without
a
trial
by
--
i
mean
before
a
judge,
because
the
rights
that
he
is
guaranteed
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment,
can't
be
just
as
thoroughly
tried
before
a
judge
in
fact
(inaudible)
then
it
can
before
a
jury.
and
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
that's
what
this
court
held
in
the
jacobellis.
i
din't
know
how
your
pronounce
that
then
this
quantity
of
books
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no.
no,
it
does
not.
absolutely
not,
because
our
court
system
was
drawn
up
of
course
--
our
court
of
criminal
procedures
was
drawn
up
by
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no,
i
--
i
do
not.
i'm
trying
to
answer
your
honor
because
there
is
no
case
in
the
louisiana
jurisprudence
of
the
federal
jurisprudence
from
this
court
that
says
that
--
that
a
jury
trial
is
required
as
a
result
of
the
privileges
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment.
now,
if
this
court
said
so,
it
will
be
something
absolutely
de
novo.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
it
--
it
maybe.
but
i
don't
think
that
it's
necessary.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
sustain
his
conviction
and
i
don't
think
that
after
you
read
this
particular
record
and
you
will
find
out
that
this
accused
rights
were
violated
in
any
way.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
but
i
do
agree
with
you
--
there's
a
lot
of
things
that
you
could
into
in
this
case
which
is
entirely
new.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh,
he
did
not
get
a
jury
trial,
that's
true.
and
if
you
--
if
you
do
that,
well
then
we
probably
have
to
go
back
and
try
him
again,
but
there
are
a
lot
of
things
in
this
case
that
you
could
go
into
as
a
--
as
a
matter
of
de
novo.
i
mean,
for
--
for
instance
with
the
fourteenth
amendment,
there's
several
things
that
you
could
go
into.
but
that
has
never
yet,
by
reason
in
any
of
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
either
by
this
court
or
by
our
louisiana
supreme
court.
now,
if
you
do
that,
i'm
--
i
will
say
this,
that
you're
going
to
oppose
a
--
a
tremendous
burden
upon
the
states,
because
then
every
misdemeanor,
every
traffic
ticket,
every
battery,
simple
battery
case
or
every
case
will
then
have
to
be
tried
by
a
jury.
and
louisiana,
it's
one
of
those
particular
states
that
has
consistently
held
and
has
been
tested
in
the
courts
that
an
individual
being
tried
by
a
judge
before
judging
on
for
a
misdemeanor,
that
all
of
that
accused
rights
are
thoroughly
protected
as
a
result
of
that
particular
trial
procedure.
and
i
--
i
say
this
again
that
--
that
if
you
--
if
you
do
do
that,
you're
going
to
force
us
to
rewrite
our
entire
constitution
on
that
particular
point.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
you
have
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
all
you
have
to
prove
that
what
he
said
was
a
result
of
ill-will
and
a
result
of
malice
and
that
it
was
done
deliberately.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh
yes.
and
again,
your
honor,
it
--
it
comes
to
the
reading
of
the
entire
record
because
when
a
man
says
that
the
only
reason
that
they're
doing
this
is
because
they're
influenced
by
racketeers.
now,
when
we
say
the
influence
by
racketeers
that
means
that
he's
influenced
necessarily
by
a
man
of
ill
repute,
and
it
indicates
of
course,
that
he
could
have
taken
a
pride.
and
then
to
further
show
his
state
of
mind,
we
never
did
have
the
opportunity
to
probe
him
of
his
state
of
mind
because
he
didn't
take
the
stand.
but
then,
immediately
after
the
charges
were
filed,
he
makes
another
statement
in
which
he
says
it's
a
racket.
he
says,
"if
i
had
to
do
it
over
again,
i
do
it,
i
would
--
i'd
have
no
regret.
i'd
continue
to
do
the
same
thing."
he
continues
to
call
the
sacred
cows,
he
continues
to
malign
him,
he
continues
to
say
that
it's
nothing
but
racketeering
questions
and
influence
that
there's
no
other
question
involved,
that
they're
an
association
of
armed
robbers
and
just
a
few
days
before
his
trial,
he
again
repeated
the
fact
that
these
judges
were
influenced
by
racketeers.
so
what
you
assume
and
all
of
that
was
introduced,
of
course,
to
show
the
question
of
malice
which
was
the
only
way
that
we
could
have
proved
it.
so
when
you
lump
all
that
together,
i
don't
see
how
any
courts
could
find
and
i
think
the
district
would
quite
properly
found
that
these
statements
were
malicious
because
we
proved
that
they
were
not
true.
we
put
the
judges
on
the
stand
and
asked
them,
"did
you
read
the
statement
of
november
2nd?"
"i
did."
"is
it
true?"
"no."
every
one
of
them
said
the
same
thing.
and
we
asked
them,
"have
you
been
subjected
to
ridicule?"
"yes."
we
couldn't
of
course
say
what
that
was
because
that
would
have
been
hearsay,
as
between
the
individual
would
have
criticized
them
in
this
particular
defendant.
but
we
did
prove
that.
we
prove
that
in
every
instance.
we
prove
that
the
statement
was
false
in
its
entirety
and
it
was
made
with
malice.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i
don't
--
would
you
mind
repeating
that
your
honor?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
i
don't
think
i
said
that
because
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes,
i
agree
with
that.
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
if
it
was
made
with
ill-will
and
malice,
yes.
and
in
addition
to
that
--
wait
a
minute.
you
mean
--
you
mean
if
--
if
the
--
the
individual
was
prosecuted
by
defamation?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no,
i
don't
think
he
could
--
could
be
convicted
under
that
set
of
circumstances.
i
do
not.
i
absolutely
do
not
because
he
would
have
a
complete
defense.
he
would
have
a
defense
of
the
truth.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that's
correct.
to
expose
any
question
to
hatred,
contempt
and
ridicule
or
to
defy
him
of
the
benefit
of
public
conference
or
social
intercourse
by
section
48,
i
don't
(inaudible).
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes,
the
statement
--
the
statute
does
say
that
your
honor,
but
we've
never
had
a
case
like
that
to
--
happened
before,
then
i
believe
that
it
--
that
it
actually
proved
that
he
had
solicited
a
bribe.
i
don't
believe
that
they
could
convict
him
with
defamation.
and
in
addition
to
that,
a
judge
is
subject
to
disbarment
procedures.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
but
this
case
is
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
and
i
come
in
that,
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
you
will
have
a
hypothetical
situation,
of
course,
i
--
i've
got
to
answer
i
believe
because
that's
the
way
it
is,
but
that
doesn't
apply
to
this
particular
case
because
this
particular
case
was
made
upon
--
predicated
upon
the
fact
that
the
state
which
this
--
this
defendant
made
were
false
and
they
were
known
to
be
false
and
were
proven
to
be
false.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that's
all
i
have.
