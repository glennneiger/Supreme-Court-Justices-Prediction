mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i
think
that
the
law
in
this
case
is
pretty
well
expressed
in
the
times-sullivan
decision
which
states
that
where
defamatory
remarks
concerned
a
public
official
in
his
official
conduct,
that
actual
malice
must
be
shown
to
sustain
a
conviction
or
recovery
in
a
civil
suit,
and
likewise
to
sustain
a
judgment
of
guilty
as
charged
in
a
criminal
statute.i
have
no
argument
with
that.
and
i
certainly
appreciate
counsel's
marvelous
opportunity
and
presentation
to
try
to
bring
this
case
under
the
time
through.
but
as
you
said
in
the
times
decision,
that
it
was
your
duty
to
--
it's
not
limited
to
the
elaboration
of
constitutional
principles.
we
must
also
in
proper
cases
review
the
evidence
to
make
sure
that
these
principles
have
been
constitutionally
applied.
i'm
very
confident
that
this
court
will
do
that.
and
i
know
that
when
you
do
that,
that
you
will
find
here,
the
district
attorney
making
malicious
statements
that
attack
the
personal
reputation
of
these
judges
which
subjected
them
to
hatred,
ridicule,
and
contempt,
and
which
destroyed
their
public
confidence.
now,
that
is
the
charge
that
the
state
made.
that
may
review
our
defamation
statutes.
and
i
ask
you
to
bear
in
mind
that
this
is
not
a
contempt
proceeding.
contempt
is
defined
as
an
entirely
different
matter
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
contempt
can
be
constructed
in
the
presence
of
the
court
or
it
can
be
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
court
such
as
a
newspaper
public
--
publishing
an
editorial
about
the
conduct
of
the
court.
and
i
might
say
that
louisiana
recognize
this,
the
clear
and
present
danger
because
in
the
case
of
graham
versus
jones
which
is
cited
in
our
supplemental
brief.
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
said
that
this
editorial
of
the
times
speaking
succinctly
have
no
effect
on
the
decision
of
these
judges
and
dismissed
the
contempt
citation
of
the
times
speaking
here.
but
we
have
no
clear
and
present
danger
involved
in
this
particular
matter
because
there
was
no
question
about
the
obstruction
of
justice.
there
was
no
uestion
about
defamatory
statement
going
to
the
personal
reputation
of
these
judges.
and
what
the
defendant
did
here?
he
used
a
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
we
contend
that
there
are
--
that
they
go
to
the
personal
reputation
of
these
judges
and
our
bill
of
information
charged
that
he
willfully
and
maliciously
made
it,
and
that
it
subjected
them
to
hatred,
contempt,
and
ridicule,
and
destroyed
their
public
confidence.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
absolutely.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
it
should
not
be
considered,
it
--
if
just
these
men
happened
to
be
judges
and
he
defamed
them
in
that
personal
category.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
i
don't
understand
your
question,
sir.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
all
that
--
absolutely
not.
he
would
have
no
occasion
to.
but
what
i'm
getting
at
is
this.
that
he
filed
--
the
defendant
filed
a
bill,
a
motion
for
a
bill
of
particulars
which
we
answered.
and
we
charged
in
that
bill
of
particulars
--
we
--
we
answered
in
the
bill
of
particulars
that
we
were
going
to
use
the
statement
in
its
entirety.
and
we
were
going
to
depend
upon
the
statement
of
november
the
2nd
in
its
entirety.
and
that
he
want
to
ask
also
whether
these
statements
were
made
as
maliciously
and
we
answered
him
that
we
would
prove
that
the
statements
who
are
malicious
both
in
law
and
in
fact
and
we
put
all
22
witnesses
to
prove
that
number
one,
the
statement
that
he
made
was
entirely
false.
and
number
two
that
it
was
made
with
'actual
malice'.
and
the
record
is
complete
in
that
particular
respect.
now,
let
me
say
this
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
well,
you
have
to
take
the
statement
in
its
entirety
and
look
at
it
as
one.
and
in
there,
he
said
that
all
of
these
things
about
the
backlog
of
cases
which
i'd
like
to
talk
about
in
a
minute
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
--
and
about
the
crowded
condition
of
the
jail,
those
judges
had
nothing
to
do
with
that,
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
that.
the
criminal
sheriff
who's
in
charge
of
the
jail,
the
district
attorney
in
louisiana
has
complete
charge
of
the
docket.
he
determines
who
comes
to
trial,
when
he
comes
to
trial,
and
how
he
will
prosecute
it.
all
of
those
statements
in
here
are
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
--
absolutely
false
and
we
prove
them
as
false.
and
then
here's
where
he
--
where
he
hits
it
that
--
at
that
character.
he
says
all
of
these.
that
first,
he
says
again,
the
message
is
clear,
“don't
rock
the
bullet
son,
you're
not
supposed
to
investigate
anything.”
well,
the
judges
never
sent
him
any
such
statement
like
that.
they
never
told
him
that,
they
all
took
the
stand
and
say
that
this
statement
was
false
in
its
entirety.
now,
the
official
--
the
--
the
statements
about
official
conduct
was
conduct
with
which
these
judges
had
nothing
to
do
with.
and
then
after
making
all
these
statements,
he
comes
up
with
this.
this
raised
his
interesting
questions
about
the
racketeer
influences
on
our
eight
vacation-minded
judges.
now,
in
the
first
place,
those
judges
were
conducting
that
court
in
accordance
with
the
law.
it
never
was
proved
that
they
took
vacation.
they
didn't
take
any
vacations
at
all.
we've
got
to
remember
that
the
courts
certainly
require
a
lot
more
time
off
the
bench
than
they
do
on
the
bench
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
that's
right,
you
said
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
--
vacation-minded.
but
of
course,
if
they
were
guilty
of
taking
excessive
vacations
contrary
to
the
law,
they
could
be
indicted
and
prosecuted
from
malpheasants.
but
instead,
he
had
a
lot
of
legal
remedies.
he
could
have
held
an
open
hearing
if
he
had
evidence
that
these
judges
were
racketeers,
or
there
was
influenced
by
racketeers.
certainly,
when
you
say
you're
influenced
by
a
racketeer,
you
mean
--
you're
stating
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
to
the
general
public.
and
when
you
say
that
i'm
influenced
by
a
racketeer
or
you're
influenced
by
a
racketeer,
that
means
that
some
crook
is
either
paying
you
off
or
bribing
you
to
influence
in
your
decision,
influence
you
in
your
decision.
and
it
can
have
no
other
meaning.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
alright,
okay.
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
leads
to
official
conduct
(voice
overlap)
because
if
that
was
true
--
if
that
was
true,
they
had
no
business
serving
these
judges.
and
that
was
the
reason
why
i
file
this
bill
of
information
against
mr.
garrison
because
if
he
could
prove
that
those
men
were
influenced
by
racketeers,
and
if
they
were
being
influenced
by
racketeers,
they
had
no
business
serving
on
that
bench
and
they
should
be
indicted,
and
tried,
and
removed.
if
he
had
a
remedy,
he
could
have
gone
to
the
supreme
court
and
ask
the
judicial,
the
administrator
of
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
to
investigate
it.
he
could
have
brought
it
before
the
grand
jury
himself
if
he
had
that
particular
evidence.
and
of
course
as
the
trial
judge
says,
“i
can't
find
out
what's
in
mr.
garrison's
mind.”
incidentally,
he
didn't
take
the
stand
at
this
case.
he
subpoenaed
some
22
witnesses
and
didn't
put
a
warrant
on.
we
put
all
23
witnesses
to
prove
that
he
made
the
statement
with
'actual
malice'.
and
then
it
damaged
these
persons
individually.
and
after
we
finished
our
case,
he
rests
it.
so
the
facts
in
this
case
are
absolutely
uncontroverted.
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
there's
no
doubt
about
the
fact
that
the
judge,
when
he
made
the
statement
“it
is
inconceivable
to
me”
that
he
knew
his
statements
were
false
when
he
made
them,
because
if
he
didn't
find
that
under
his
oath
of
office,
he's
required
to
find
the
men
not
guilty.
so
that's
one
of
the
ingredients
of
the
offense.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
false
and
malicious
statement.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
because
of
the
fact
that
we
have
proved
that
the
statement
was
made
with
‘actual
malice'
to
injure
these
people.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
well,
we
go
back
to
gray
matter
that
you're
talking
--
that
you've
talked
about
it.
now,
this
could
be
--
yes,
this
could
be
a
--
but
you
see,
he
was
using
a
qualified
privilege
as
a
vehicle
to
vindicate
himself
against
these
persons
individually.
and
several
of
our
historians
have
made
statements
concerning
that.
we
have
one
in
our
original
brief.
i
don't
remember
who
made
it
but
he
said
that
the
first
amendment
said
it
didn't
allow
an
individual
the
right
or
freedom
of
speech
to
abuse
that
particular
liberty.
and
louisiana
law,
i
submit
is
in
complete
accord
with
the
rationale
of
the
sullivan
or
the
times
case,
however
you
want
to
refer
to
it.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
oh
yes,
the
evidence
proves
that.
let
me
briefly
run
down
this
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
oh
yes,
absolutely.
because
he
certainly
knows
the
criminal
statutes,
because
he's
a
district
attorney
and
he's
a
lawyer.
1557
provides
that
--
that
he's
in
charge
of
the
docket.
he
knew
that
that
was
his
responsibility
to
bring
those
cases
to
the
trial
not
the
judges.
the
prisoner
was
in
jail
and
wanted
to
get
a
quick
trial,
and
at
the
end,
he
did
not
want
to
bring
him
to
trial,
he
could
file
a
motion
with
the
court
in
a
motion
--
the
court
would
then
fix
the
trial
date.
but
you
see
the
reason
i
say
it's
within
the
rationale
of
the
sullivan
and
the
times
case
is
this
particular
reason.
a
cause
that
is
important
from
our
defamation
statute,
our
defamation
statute
says
that
defamation
is
the
malicious
publication
or
expression
in
any
malice
to
anyone
other
than
the
part
of
defense,
to
expose
persons
to
hatred,
contempt,
to
ridicule,
or
to
deprive
him
of
the
benefit
of
public
confidence
or
social
intercourse.
it's
questionable
about
a
fine
of
$3000
and
not
more
than
one
year
in
jail.
now
49
provide
--
statutes
of
fourteenth
and
that
provides
this.
a
qualified
privilege
exists,
an
actual
malice
must
be
proved
regardless
of
whether
the
publication
is
true
or
false
in
the
following
situations,
the
conduct
of
a
person
in
respect
to
public
affairs.
and
then
the
next
article
gives
an
absolute
privilege
to
a
legislator,
a
judge,
and
a
statement
of
a
witness
stand
and
so
forth.
and
this
is
the
same
statute
that
you
mentioned
in
the
times
case
that
was
enacted
in
the
1908
gorman
case
where
the
state
attorney
general
was
running
for
office
and
there
you
found
that
the
law
was
appropriate
to
set
forth
in
the
kansas
case
and
noted
that
there
was
some
20
somewhat
states
that
had
similar
laws
and
louisiana
i
submit
is
one
that
had
similar
laws.
now
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
yes
sir,
they're
elected
for
--
i
think
eight
years,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
yes.
you
see,
the
parish
of
orleans
has
a
home
rule
charter.
and
the
district
attorney
is
elected
at
the
same
time
the
mayor
and
the
counsel
went
of.
they
go
in
for
a
period
of
four
years.
other
district
attorneys
in
state
are
six
years.
but
the
judges
if
i'm
--
the
12
--
they
have
12
years
in
the
parish
of
orleans.
and
in
other
districts
in
the
state
of
louisiana,
of
course,
they
have
six
years.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
they
have
(voice
overlap)
--
they
preside
over
for
sections.
they
had
--
he
--
he
approve
each
and
each
one
has
that
particular
section.
and
the
judge
with
the
longest
service
which
is
judge
black
has
been
on
the
bench
44
years
out
of
his
50
years
of
practice.
with
the
long
and
honorable
career,
he
was
one
of
the
men
that
was
defamed
in
this
case.
the
one
with
the
longest
service
is
the
chief
judge.
now,
let
me
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
well
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
when
he
took
office,
he
promised
that
he
was
going
to
close
down
bourbon
street.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
well
i
mean
that
--
that
was
his
premise
and
of
course
that's
the
heart
of
his
statements.
he
claims
that
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
that
the
judges
blocked
his
vice
investigations.
now,
it's
in
this
record
that
the
judges
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
vice
investigations
because
the
state
of
louis
--
the
state
supreme
court
in
the
case
of
state
versus
marrero
has
said
that
a
district
attorney
is
not
an
investigator.
that
in
the
parish
of
orleans
and
this
is
in
our
constitution
in
orleans,
in
parish
of
orleans,
that
the
police
department
is
the
one
to
make
these
particular
investigations
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
that's
why
he's
got
12
--
yes
sir?
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
oh
absolutely
not.
he's
got
an
open
hearing.
he
can
bring
or
file
a
bill
of
information.
he
can
bring
witnesses
before
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
oh
yes,
in
the
parish
of
orleans,
states
in
session,
all
of
that.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
the
district
judge
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
that's
absolutely
correct
and
everyone
--
everyone
of
these
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
oh
no.
but
the
district
attorney
is
a
legal
adviser
to
the
grand
jury.
and
in
the
parish
of
orleans,
he
collects
his
evidence
from
the
police
department
and
brings
it
before
the
grand
jury,
you
understand?
and
each
one
of
these
judges
got
up
on
the
stand,
and
said
that
they
had
denied
that
they
had
ever
blocked
his
attempts.
that
each
one
went
up
and
said,
he
didn't
care,
i
can't
repeat
his
word,
he
said
he
didn't
give
a
--
what
you
call
they
could
close
anything
up
on
bourbon
street
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
because
he
had
no
sympathy
for
them.
so
that
portion
of
the
statement
was
absolutely
false.
and
we
put
superintendent
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
i'm
talking
about
the
statement
that
mr.
garrison
made
when
he
said
that
they
blocked
his
attempts
to
stimulate
vice.
and
you
see
that's
where
this
racketeering
influence
becomes
so
important
because
he
says
that
--
that
they
tried
to
stop
fines
and
forfeitures
for
him
when
the
first
beer
drinking
spot
was
closed
down.
and
that
raised
these
questions
of
racketeering
influence.
so
when
you
consider
his
statement
together
with
the
background
of
this
thing,
it
only
means
one
thing,
that
you're
influenced
by
racketeers,
you
hate
criminal
district
judges.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
no,
it's
partially
correct.
let
me
straighten
that
out
for
you.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
and
this
is
all
in
the
record
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
you
see
in
--
in
orleans
parish,
they
have
a
lot
of
expeditions.
and
the
legislature
provided
that
the
fines
and
forfeitures
would
go
to
the
district
attorney,
would
be
put
into
account,
and
he
would
use
that
for
the
expenses
of
his
offices
for
extraditions.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
vice.
now,
he
would
use
that
for
extraditions
and
other
general
expenses.
at
the
end
of
the
year,
he'd
keep
half
of
the
money
himself,
he
turn
the
half
over
to
the
city
treasury.
they'll
also
provide
and
he's
got
to
file
a
motion
with
the
city
clerk
saying
that
“i
want
$3000
for
a
room.”
and
--
then
he
files
that
with
the
clerk
of
the
city
court
in
new
orleans.
and
then
24
hours
after
that,
i
believe
it
is,
he
goes
to
the
court
to
anyone
of
the
judges,
to
get
an
approval
of
that
particular
expenditure.
it's
a
motion
that's
filed
in
open
court.
it's
a
public
record.
now,
what
started
this
five
out
of
eight
business
whether
it
was
right
or
not,
was
the
fact
--
and
this
is
all
in
the
record,
was
the
fact
that
mr.
garrison
went
to
this
retired
judge
to
get
him
to
approve
this
application
for
this
room
and
the
judge
says,
“i
think
it's
too
expensive.
give
me
some
proof.”
and
in
the
meantime,
this
judge
went
on
his
vacation.
and
he
went
to
another
judge
and
told
this
judge,
“that
judge
beauharnais
said
it
was
alright.”
and
upon
mr.
garrison's
statement
and
assurance,
the
judge
signed
it.
and
it
turned
out
later
on
to
be
completely
false.
so
the
district
attorney
was
playing
one
judge
up
against
the
other.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
and
that's
when
they
met
--
now
i
say
this
mr.
black
--
mr.
justice
black,
may
i
say
this.
now,
before
he
took
office
and
this
is
in
the
record,
he
said
he
thought
the
system
was
bad
that
the
judges
wanted
to
change
and
he
agreed
with
it
that
it
should
be
changed.
he
was
present
at
that
en
banc
meeting
and
didn't
disapprove
or
voice
any
objection
whatsoever.
and
so
then
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
this
was
the
retired
judge.
he
went
to
asheville,
north
carolina.
but
that
was
a
legal
vacation
because
he
had
absolutely
retired.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
now
--
and
of
course,
that's
when
--
let
me
say
this
--
this
is
in
the
record
too,
that
there
were
some
73
motions
approved
by
these
judges
during
this
controversy,
they
gave
him
over
--
over
eight
--
i
think
$65,000
to
operate
on.
so
how
--
how
could
they
be
blocking
his
efforts
as
to
what
he
wanted
to
do
if
they
were
approving
that
much
expenses
for
it?
then
in
addition
to
that,
he
had
12
policemen
who
are
paid
for
by
the
city
and
he's
back
in
call
to
use
as
he
saw
fit
to
investigate,
to
do
anything.
we
put
the
police
superintendent
on
the
stand.
he
said
that
he
picked
the
12
men
on
--
i'm
talking
about
the
defendant.
the
defendant
picked
the
12
men
out.
and
the
defendant
had
them.
and
that
he
hadn't
interfered
with
their
activities
that
they
reported
to
him,
and
did
what
he
was
supposed
to
do,
so
all
of
that
is
in
the
record
to
prove
that
this
statement
that
he
made
on
november
the
2nd
was
absolutely
false.
now,
let
me
go
into
this
question
of
malice.
he
said
that
they
were
subject
to
racketeering
influence.
on
the
same
day,
he
said
that
they
were
taking
vacations
and
that
that
wasn't
nothing
but
a
racket.
he
said
something
--
in
fact
one
of
the
judges
to
be
charitable,
he's
a
lie.
then
he
said
the
only
way
to
get
these
sacred
cows
back
to
work
is
bring
this
to
the
public.
then
he
made
a
speech
at
a
catholic
church
group
in
new
orleans.
and
he
got
up
and
he
repeated
the
fact.
he
says,
“i'm
going
to
continue.”
he
says,
“i
don't
care.”
he
says,
“i'm
not
going
to
let
any
judge
stop
me.”
he
says,
“i
don't
care
what
they
say.”
he
says,
“i
don't
care
whether
we
have
perfect
rules,
red
rules.
or
any
other
kind
of
rule,
i'm
not
going
to
let
any
judge
get
in
my
way.
and
i
call
to
your
attention
that
i
don't
care
being
a
reckless
disregard
for
the
truth.”
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
he
says
he's
not
going
to
stop
his
investigations,
is
what
he's
talking
about
which
the
judges
had
--
hadn't
done
and
we
prove
that.
he
again
repeated
that
they
were
subject
to
racketeering
influences.
and
then
he
made
up
the
statement,
he
says,
“i
don't
care
what
you
call
it.”
he
says,
“that's
the
only
reason
they're
subject
to
racketeering
influences.”
they
made
a
speech
after
he
was
--
while
the
trial
was
--
or
just
right
before
the
trial.
he
made
a
speech
on
television.
he
repeated
the
fact
that
these
judges
were
subject
to
racketeering
influences.
and
yet
he
told
one
on
private
that
he
didn't
really
mean
that
about
him.
and
he
said
to
another
one,
judge
wimbley
was
a
real
good
judge.
but
then
he
gets
up
and
makes
the
speech
that
same
afternoon
in
which
he
says
they're
all
subject
to
racketeering
influences
and
there
can
be
no
other
reason.
and
then
when
he
made
the
speech
to
the
church
group,
he
says,
“i'm
going
to
continue
to
tell
the
people
of
new
orleans
about
this.”
he
says,
“because
i've
got
no
opposition
to
turn
to.”
he
says,
“the
other
officials
are
the
association
of
armed
robbers.”
now,
you
mean
to
tell
me
you're
going
to
say
that
the
--
you
keep
saying
that.
you
keep
repeating
that
about
five
or
six
times
and
you
tell
that
to
the
public
and
that
the
captain
orlow,
he
made
a
statement
after
it
all
happened.
and
that's
in
the
record.
he
says,
“if
i
had
to
do
it
again,”
he
says,
“i'd
say
the
same
thing.”
as
the
trial
judge
says
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
all
of
the
officials,
he
was
talking
about
the
judges.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
that's
in
the
record
(voice
overlap)
i
saw
it,
i
can't
find
it,
just
a
second.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
i
can't
find
it
right
now,
your
honor,
but
it's
definitely
in
the
record
because
it
was
--
comes
in
a
testimony
--
of
one
of
the
court
throughout
that
took
it
all
down,
that
comes
in
a
testimony
of
--
what,
259,
i
think.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
of
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
that's
the
witness
of
the
court
reporter.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
well,
that
was
the
subject
matter
of
his
speech.
it
was
his
condemnation
of
these
judges.
that
was
what
his
whole
speech
was
about.
that's
what
he's
talking
about.
they've
got
to
please
--
i
submit
to
this
court
that
our
laws
are
complete.
the
court
with
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
sullivan
case,
i
don't
think
there's
a
doubt
about
that.
and
this
court,
i'm
talking
about
the
state
court
that
tried
it,
found
and
proved
that
he
was
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
he
had
every
constitutional
safeguard
afforded
him
in
the
trial
of
his
case.
we
were
very
fair
about
it.
the
judge
found
that
the
trial
judge
was
very
fair
about
it.
and
if
you
will
read
his
decision
which
starts,
i
think
on
the
16
of
the
record,
you
will
find
that
it
is
thoroughly,
it's
complete,
that
his
decision
was
based
on
the
evidence
--
on
the
evidence,
it
was
given
by
the
23
witnesses
that
the
state
produced.
and
there's
nothing
in
this
record
that
shows
any
of
these
testimonies
that
these
witnesses
produced
to
be
false.
it's
devoid
of
it.
during
a
trial,
he
said
he
was
going
to
take
the
stand
himself
but
he
didn't.
the
judges
got
up
and
said
that
that
statement
was
false.
the
judges
got
up
and
said
that
they
had
been
exposed
to
hatred
and
ridicule.
one
of
them
even
said
that
who's
a
member
in
new
or
--
in
new
orleans
athletic
club,
he
says
--
now
and
he
walked
into
the
club,
all
the
members
started
how
to
move,
move,
move.
well,
how
much
does
a
judge
--
how
much
does
a
person
got
to
be
subjected
to?
and
that
state
--
others
had
phone
calls
with
bad
english,
“you
so
and
so
racketeer,
and
so
forth.”
one
of
the
judges'
son
was
absolutely
insulted
in
school.
one
of
the
pupils
told
this
--
told
this
particular
boy
of
the
judge
beauharnais'
boy
that,
“your
father
is
a
crook.
your
father
is
a
thief.”
that's
all
in
the
record
and
none
of
it
is
uncontradicted,
not
a
bit
of
it.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
no,
no,
no.
i
might
say
that
the
defendant
is
a
very
valuable
man.
he
talks
a
lot.
he
who
said
that
up
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
rendered
decisions
not
in
this
case,
when
he
said,
what
would
typically
be
written
on
it?
and
incidentally
in
one
of
his
valuable
threats
towards
the
end
of
this
matter
in
january
of
1963,
he
even
predicted
your
decision.
he
said
that
he
was
going
to
be
convicted
in
the
lower
courts
but
at
the
supreme
law
--
the
supreme
court
then
would
reverse
it.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
i
do
--
he
didn't
get
to
that
gentlemen.
he
didn't
get
to
that.
but
that's
definitely
in
all
of
that
of
course
is
in
this
particular
record.
well,
i
say
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
no,
no,
no
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
that's
right.
that
was
introduced.
that
was
evidence.
we
introduced
all
these
evidence
to
show
malice
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
because
it
was
instances
that
related
to
this
particular
statement
of
november
the
2nd,
the
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
oh
yes,
absolutely,
absolutely.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
you
can
show
--
you
can
show
malice
surrounding
an
event.
by
circumstances
that
properly
relate
to
it
even
before
or
after
the
particular
instance,
i
think
that's
universal.
i
have
no
doubt
about
that.
and
the
judge
only
allowed
that
for
the
purpose
of
showing
malice.
now,
first
is
when
the
judges
testified
that
they
were
subjected
to
hatred,
contempt,
and
ridicule.
the
judge
did
not
let
them
say
what
that
was
because
he
held
that
that
of
course
would
be
his
in
which
we
know
is
correct,
and
of
course,
it
was
sufficient
for
the
information
and
the
charge
to
prove
that
they
were
subjected
and
that
they
knew
that
they
got
up
and
testified
accordingly.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
on
defamation?
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
no,
i
don't
think
so.
there's
been
none
of
such
serious
nature
that
i
know
of.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
there
--
there
have
been
no
--
this
is
the
only
one
that
i
know
of.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
the
only
one
i've
ever
heard
of.
but
of
course,
let
me
say
this
that
all
of
these
conferences
that
they
had
--
the
judges
have
and
the
district
attorney
had
concerning
this
matter,
the
judges
never
got
up
and
made
any
public
statements.
he
was
the
only
one.
and
we
proved
that
he
made
these
statements
deliberate,
that
he
dictated
to
this
reporter,
that
he
did
it
with
thoughtfulness,
that's
all
in
mr.
bernhardt's
testimony.
and
if
you
repeated
it
and
let
him
read
it
back
to
make
sure
that
that's
what
he
wanted
to
say
and
as
i
say.
and
i
mean
this
at
the
very
bottom
of
my
heart
that
those
judges
were
guilty
of
racketeering
influence.
they
got
no
business
serving
on
that
bench.
and
the
state
proved
its
case.
he
didn't
offer
any
evidence
that
what
he
said
was
true.
he
didn't
offer
any
evidence
that
he
had
a
reasonable
belief
that
it
was
true.
and
even
so,
the
state
showed
'actual
malice'
in
the
presentation
of
this
case
and
the
conviction
should
stand
and
i
trust
and
pray
that
you
would
object
this
writ
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
improvidently
granted.
thank
you
so
much.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
defamation
statute?
oh
no,
no,
no!
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
we
had
a
case
in
louisiana
which
was
decided
december
16th.
we
have
a
guy
by
the
name
of
marty
defamed
the
district
attorney
and
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
reaffirmed
its
decision
in
the
garrison
case
because
the
defense
is
there,
well
it's
the
same
as
this
particular
case,
on
the
same
date.
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
reversed
the
case
of
mrs.
webster
because
she
was
not
allowed
or
given
the
opportunity
to
prove
that
a
statement
that
she
made
was
true.
we've
had
a
lot
of
defamation
prosecutions.
but
the
only
one
--
the
only
one
that
i
was
with
mr.
justice
black
(voice
overlap)
was
there
any
in
new
orleans
under
this
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
this
is
the
only
case
--
this
is
the
only
time
that
i
know
of
that
a
district
attorney
has
called
the
judge
that
he's
supposed
to
cooperate
with
that
he's
under
the
influence
of
racketeers.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
well,
there
are
plenty
of
statements.
now,
he
would
have
said
that
this
--
this
court
doesn't
know
what
it's
doing
or
these
judges
don't
know
what
they're
doing,
something
like
that.
i've
heard
this
court
criticize
quite
precipitously
in
louisiana.
but
nobody
has
said
that
you
are
influenced
by
racketeers.
and
nobody's
called
you
sacred
cows
or
said
that
you
belong
to
an
association
of
armed
robbers.
i've
been
called
a
lot
of
things
in
my
official
conduct,
the
district
attorney
supported
my
opponent
in
the
last
election.
we
got
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
no,
that
was
introduced
to
show
the
state
of
his
mind
that
that
was
malice,
that's
the
only
way
we
could
prove
it
but
then
he
didn't
take
the
stand.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
oh
yes,
i'm
pretty
sure.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
yes,
very
much
so.
there's
the
lambert
case,
the
(inaudible)
case,
the
jones
case,
the
--
but
--
that
i
know
are
25
or
30
of
them.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
i
think
that
the
interest
of
the
state
is
exactly
what
i
stated
before.
that
the
honesty
of
these
men
were
at
stake.
and
if
they
had
been
guilty
of
racketeering
influence,
they
had
no
business
serving
on
the
bench.
and
that
was
the
reason
that
the
state
had
at
this
case.
you
see,
the
judges
filed
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
--
may
i
say
this
mr.
justice
white.
after
he
made
the
statement,
the
judges
filed
an
affidavit
in
the
district
attorney's
office.
and
of
course
the
district
attorney
can
now
process
any
case
he
wants.
and
he
has
one
of
these
first
assistants
coming
to
court
and
now
processed
the
affidavit
that
the
judges
made.
so
then
the
judges
met
en
banc
and
ultimately
to
file
this.
this
is
the
only
way
we
could
have
done
it,
because
under
the
constitution
of
louisiana,
the
attorney
general
has
the
interest
of
the
state,
he
can
intervene,
he
can
supersede,
he
can
dismiss,
or
anything.
and
i
would
--
it
came
in
there
because
there
was
no
other
way
that
we
could
determine
the
truth
of
the
matter.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
i
do
because
of
the
fact
that
if
these
judges
were
guilty
of
those
charges,
they're
not
only
violating
the
code
of
ethics,
they
were
violating
the
law
of
the
state
of
louisiana
and
they
should
be
prosecuted.
and
if
i
could
have
found
evidence,
i
investigated
a
third
and
if
i
could
have
found
evidence
that
there
was
any
sort
of
a
bribe
or
racketeering
influence
by
new
orleans
racketeers
on
these
judges,
i
can
assure
you
i
would
have
brought
it
to
the
grand
jury
of
prosecutors.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
we
didn't
have
a
grand
jury
investigation.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
i
pro
--
i
think
so
and
i
think
that
the
proof
of
that
putting
is
the
fact
that
he
made
these
--
he
made
the
statement
on
november
the
2nd
of
1962
falsely,
that
there
was
no
truth
in
it,
and
that
he
did
it
maliciously.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
because
he
had
violated
the
law.
we
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
i
was
ordered
to
do
this
by
these
particular
judges.
and
then
that
was
--
of
that
great
of
importance.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
what's
that?
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
the
judges
met
en
banc
and
ask
me
by
order,
would
i
file
this
bill
of
information,
because
they
were
anxious
to
find
out
their
racketeering
influences
themselves.
this
was
a
very
hidden
controversy
in
--
in
louisiana,
in
the
city
of
new
orleans.
and
somebody
had
to
do
something
about
it.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
the
ladies
--
lambert
case
was
a
statement
that
the
district
attorney
had
put
a
guy
in
the
penitentiary,
put
a
prison
into
penitentiary
on
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
that
he
illegally
committed
to
the
penitentiary
on
urgent
testimony
of
a
certain
prison.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
they
were
affirmed,
yes
by
our
supreme
court.
in
other
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
yes.
now
--
now
let
me
--
in
this
lambert
case,
the
district
attorney
was
defamed
and
we
have
a
procedure.
well,
if
the
district
attorney
is
interested,
he's
got
to
refuse
himself
at
the
court
--
a
request
to
the
court
and
that
is
if
he's
interested
in
the
prosecution,
do
you
understand?
and
the
only
person
that
can
prosecute
--
the
court
has
got
to
find
an
attorney
within
the
district
who
has
the
capabilities
of
a
district
attorney.
and
then
if
he
can't
find
any,
he
certifies
that
to
the
attorney
general.
and
the
attorney
general
can
assign
another
district
attorney
to
prosecute
that
particular
case.
or
i
could
go
in
and
prosecute
it
myself
because
i
have
that
authority.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
oh,
no.
no,
i
don't
--
i
don't
make
that
contention
your
honor.
i'm
--
i'm
sure
that
a
place
like
bourbon
street
that
there
is
a
lot
of
vice
there.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
no,
i
didn't
say
that.
i
say
i
--
i
presumed
that
there
is,
i
assume
that
there
is
because
there
has
been
several
suits
that
the
district
attorney
filed,
that
he
padlocked
some
of
the
places.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
somebody
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
somebody
would
evidently
be
lax
somewhere
along
the
line.
but
you
see
he
--
he
claims
in
his
statement
that
the
judges
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
no,
i
don't
think
so.
that
would
be
up
to
the
district
attorney
or
it
would
be
up
to
the
police
department.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
oh,
i
could
go
in
there
but
i
don't
make
it
a
practice
to
run
around
in
the
state
of
louisiana
superseding
district
attorneys
and
so
forth
unless
they're
actually
involved
--
or
involved
and
the
situation
is
of
such
gravity
that
it
necessitates
it
such
as
the
case
here.
but
you
see
he
claims
that
the
judges
blocked
his
investigations
and
we
proved
on
the
trial
of
this
case
that
the
judges
did
not,
that
that
was
false,
that
they
wanted
to
cooperate
with
him.
and
if
they
did
cooperate
with
him,
that
they
approved
motions
for
expenses,
and
that
he
had
12
policemen
that
could
do
--
go
do
undercover
work
if
he
wanted,
and
so
forth.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
well,
there's
no
doubt
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
well,
i
assume
that
they
would
be
--
yes
that
would
be
the
logic
between
them.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
with
that
assumption,
yes,
i
agree.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
well,
i
can't
change
the
facts,
your
honor.
i
mean
–-
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
i
said
in
my
opinion
--
i
said
in
my
opinion,
i
assume
that
there
was.
and
because
of
the
fact
that
the
district
attorney
has
filed
padlock
proceedings
on
several
places
and
has
actually
close
some
of
them.
i'm
trying
to
be
as
frank
and
truthful
as
i
possibly
can.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
yes.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
yes
but
he
didn't
prove
that.
he
didn't
prove
that
the
judges
stopped
his
--
his
so-called
funds
until
that
happened.
that
was
absolutely
repudiated
by
the
testimony
of
the
judges.
that's
the
very
point
i'm
coming
to,
that
this
thing
was
so
grave
and
that
there
was
--
that
this
particular
charge
would
really
amount
into
bribery
by
racketeers
of
the
judges
that
something
had
to
be
done
about
it.
the
truth
had
to
come
out.
and
that
was
proved
to
be
deliberately
false
by
the
testimony.
there's
no
evidence
in
here
to
show
that
that
was
even
--
that
he
even
thought
that.
he'd
had
a
reasonable
belief
of
that.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
i
didn't
have
to
do
it.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
i
had
that
discretion
under
article
7,
section
56.
but
as
i
told
this
court
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
no,
they
did
not.
no
one
ever
ask
me
to
do
that.
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
now
frankly
--
frankly
it
sets
about
superseding
the
district
attorney.
in
the
case
of
kemp
versus
stanley,
our
supreme
court
held
that
the
attorney
general
could
not
supersede
a
district
attorney
who
is
willing
to
do
his
duty.
and
so
here
mr.
garrison
has
been
working
hard
and
has
been
closing
up
quite
a
few
places.
so
i
would
have
no
actual
authority
to
supersede
him
unless
he
had
actually
refused
to
do
his
duty,
do
you
understand?
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
but
--
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
no,
not
that
i
know
of.
but
he
claimed
that
the
judges
had
kept
him
from
doing
this.
and
that
was
absolutely
false
because
as
i
said
previously,
time
and
time
again,
the
record
shows
that
he
had
clear
funds
available.
the
record
shows
that
he
had
these
12
policemen
to
do
his
work.
and
that
the
judges
in
no
way
had
ever
issued
any
messages
to
him
or
any
orders
to
him
to
stop
his
crime
prevention
work.
i
thank
you.
anymore
questions?
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
ask
you
one
thing?
mr.
jack
p.f.
gremillion
what
he
--
what
mr.
deutsch
is
just
saying
about
the
organizations,
that's
his
interpretation
of
it
but
he,
the
district
attorney,
never
did
explained
that
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
he
was
talking
about
a
political
organization.
so
i
don't
know
what
he
was
talking
about
but
i
do
know
that
he
was
in
a
controversy
with
these
judges
and
that's
when
--
that
was
a
subject
matter
of
his
speech
at
that
particular
auditorium.
