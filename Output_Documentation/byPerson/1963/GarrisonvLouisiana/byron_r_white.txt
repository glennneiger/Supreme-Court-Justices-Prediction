justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
the
citation
to
that
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
do
go
as
far
as
though
saying
that
--
or
do
you
that
under
the
first
and
fourteenth,
there
may
be
no
physical
constitutions
provided?
justice
byron
r.
white
there'll
be
no
--
no
criminal
constitutions
for
the
libel
of
the
public
officials?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
that
would
be
pursued
there,
if
i
may
--
if
i
made
a
private
--
if
i
made
a
public
official
recover
damages
then
for
--
for
new
york
times,
i
suppose
he
could
recover
damages
for
his
--
for
the
libel
that
you
felt
that
the
public
officials,
he
can
make
a
necessary
choice.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
--
but
you
say
that
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
deutsch,
let's
assume
the
--
let's
assume,
the
person
who
held
a
deliberate
lie
--
deliberate
their
exams
and
lie
about
the
public
official,
are
those
are
lie
that
he
held
it
anyway
and
he
does
it
with
th
expressed
purposes
that
destroying
the
man's
reputation,
and
there
are
people
like
that.
and
you're
only
--
why
shouldn't
this
probably
open
to
criminal
consititutions?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
only
answer
so
far
is,
there's
been
a
libel.
that's
seditious
libel.
it's
a
seditious
libel
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
really
to
serve
the
truth,
we
should
protect
the
light
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
your
constitutional
protection
to
the
known
deliberate
lier
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
with
the
actual
malice?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
makes
no
relevant
of
the
facts
--
justice
byron
r.
white
then,
in
that
case,
we
don't
have
to
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
same
rule
applies
--
you
say
that
they
construed
actual
malice,
as
the
time
--
by
new
york
times.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
know
of
any
evidence
to
this
record
that
that
--
to
the
effect
that
the
defendant
knew
or
that
there
was
reckless
disregard
for
the
suits
or
statements
that
he
made
other
than
the
judge's
statement
that
of
course,
no
one
could
make
a
statement
about
this
man,
this
honorable
man
without
having
actual
malice
or
without
having
references
regarding
the
proofs.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
didn't
prove
the
statements
of
false,
that's
what
(inaudible),
statements
are
false.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
where's
the
evidence
--
where's
the
evidence
in
the
record
about
malice?
are
there
--
i
agree
--
i
agree
that
there's
evidence
in
their
own
as
to
whether
or
not
that
(inaudible)
this
case
is
true
or
false,
what
about
the
malice?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
is
just
--
just
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i
was
really
wanting
to
--
i
am
familiar
about
the
opinion
of
it,
i
was
wondering
about
the
evidence
in
the
record
with
all
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
jury
trial
mr.
gremillion,
mr.
attorney
general?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
a
defamation
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
that
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
say
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
the
finding
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
their
official
capacity?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
your
brief
have
to
say
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
what
was
in
there
in
a
decision
that
was
passed
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
suggestion
--
there's
no
suggestion
in
this
case
that
any
of
the
allegations
that
he
took
a
bribe
in
connection
with
any
of
the
suits.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
the
word
that
you
said
about
it
was
indirect
view.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
mr.
gremillion
that
the
--
that
these
statements
really
are
not
under
attack
upon
the
official
conduct
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
is
the
--
is
it
your
claim
in
this
case
could
not
be
viewed
as
criticism
of
the
public
officials?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
that
the
other
--
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
the
charge
of
--
you
mean
the
official
conduct
it
seems
to
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
--
do
you
think
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
that
show
that
this
fellow,
that
he
actually
knew
the
information
was
false?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
these
were
false,
but
that
he
knew
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
made
after
--
after
he
was
in
charged
and
concerning
the
charges.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
gremillion,
can
i
just
have
a
moment?
did
you
--
did
you
indicate
that
this
is
the
only
constitution
under
this
defamation
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
frequently
used?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
these
armed
robber
charge
isn't
here,
is
it?
it
isn't
what
they
want
him
to
be
prosecuted.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
can
file
another
charge
of
this
statement.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
but
--
but
in
any
event
this
criminal
--
criminal
defamation
statute
is
used
frequently.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
what
--
what
do
you
think
that's
pretty
good
to
all
the
interest
of
the
state
is
that
is
getting
into
deciding
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
did
not
state
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
do
you
--
do
you
feel
that
the
state
has
been
interested
in
vindicating
the
reputation
of
the
petitioners?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
have
--
the
state
could
have
found
the
truth
of
this
matter.
you
apparently
conceded
it
in
finding,
what's
the
result
of
the
truth
of
the
matter
in
the
grand
jury
investigation
right
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
anyway
you
--
you
feel
that
you
--
you
prove
what
the
truth
of
the
matter
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
why
did
--
but
why
don't
you
determine
the
truth
of
the
matter
and
why
--
and
you
know
that
it
is
true
and
why
--
what
--
what's
the
statement
that
the
--
then
prosecute
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
a
largely
(voice
overlap)
on
constitutional
grounds
to
me
and
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
you
say
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
in
the
--
then
he
thought
in
the
state
court
and
you
have
to
do
this
in
order
to
avoid
the
truth
to
proceed.
