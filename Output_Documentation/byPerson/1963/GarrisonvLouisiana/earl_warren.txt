chief

mr.
attorney
general,
i
understood
you
to
say
though
that
under
your
statute,
even
if
it
was
true
and
done
with
malice,
can
you
define
malice
as
ill-will
that
he
would
still
be
guilty
under
your
statute?
was
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
you
to
say
that
under
your
statute,
even
if
what
you
said
was
true,
if
he
said
it
with
malice,
namely,
with
ill-will
for
these
judges
that
it
was
punishable.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
your
statute
says
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
let
me
ask
--
let
me
put
a
hypothetical
question
to
you
then.
suppose
a
judge
approached
the
litigant
and
--
and
told
him
that
for
a
certain
amount
of
money,
he
would
decide
the
case
in
his
favor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
litigant
became
outraged
and
had
thorough
ill-will
toward
the
judge
from
that
time
on
and
exposed
him
to
the
public
and
stated
that
as
a
fact,
that
the
judge
had
solicited
a
bribe
from
him
in
order
to
decide
the
case
in
his
favor.
he
did
it
intentionally
for
the
purpose
of
discrediting
the
judge
in
the
eyes
of
the
public.
under
your
statute,
would
it
be
libel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
would.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
statute
says
whether
it's
true
or
false.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understand
that.
i
--
i'm
just
testing
out
the
standard
of
your
--
the
limit
of
your
statute
and
so
on.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
--
you
a
have
a
few
moments.
would
you
--
would
you
take
them
now?
chief
justice

warren
number
400,
jim
garrison,
appellant,
versus
louisiana.
mr.
deutsch.
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
was
--
happened
when
he
was
elected
and
took
office?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
that
judge
was
retired
at
the
time
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
record?
it's
right
in
the
very
beginning
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
attorney
general
gremillion
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
may
i
ask
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
what
particular
statement
or
statements
are
in
his
press
--
press
release
which
disassociate
these
justices
from
their
--
from
their
official
duties?
in
other
words,
what
did
he
say
that
can
--
can
be
said
to
be
only
personal
against
these
judges
and
not
what
has
to
do
with
their
official
conduct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
the
judges?
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
i
un
--
i
understood
mr.
deutsch
to
say
that
prior
to
the
time
this
man
was
district
attorney,
under
the
law,
the
judges
--
this
group
of
judges
or
one
of
them
at
least
was
in
the
habit
of
authorizing
expenditures
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
by
the
district
attorney
for
the
suppression
of
vice
that
when
he
came
in,
they
--
they
have
the
meeting
en
banc
and
decided
that
it
would
take
five
of
the
eight
judges
to
authorize
such
expenditures
and
that
thereafter,
they
would
--
they
would
permit
no
expenditures
of
that
kind
by
him,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i'm
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
may
have
then
stated
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
i
noticed
that
the
gist
of
this
complaint
is
that
there
is
vice,
and
crime,
and
corruption
on
bourbon
street
in
new
orleans.
is
there
any
proof
in
--
is
there
any
proof
of
the
fact
that
there
is
no
such
vice
or
corruption
on
bourbon
street
or--?
chief
justice
earl
warren
okay,
but
you
--
just
a
moment,
do
you
say
they
allow
vice
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
who
--
who
would
--
you
presumed
that
they
would
let
it.
who
would
do
that?
the
police
who
were
--
who
were
assigned
to
him
and
that
these
judges
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
must
experience
only,
it
must
be
his
only
investigators?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
would
you
have
any
--
would
you
have
any
jurisdiction
over
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
could
still
foresee
that
anyone
in
--
in
the
event
could
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
policemen
are
the
ones
who
--
who
have
the
responsibility
of
policing
bourbon
street,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
they
--
if
there
was
this
vice
and
corruption
there,
would
they
be
likely
on
assignment
to
him
to
clean
that
place
up?
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
as
you
say
you
assume
that
they
permitted
the
vice
to
continue
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
don't
seem
to
fit
with
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
can't
tell
you
the
fact
that
there
was
vice
and
corruption?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
sets
here
that
no,
there
was
--
we
--
we
have
--
there's
no
question
raised
about
expenditures
until
the
first
beer
drinking
joint
began
to
cave
in.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
his
--
that's
his
complaint.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
think
none,
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
deutsch,
--
mr.
deutsch,
how
long
was
he
in
office
before
this
judge
attacked
him
for
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
suggesting
the
calendar?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
very
well.
