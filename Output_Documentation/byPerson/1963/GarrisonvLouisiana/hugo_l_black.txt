that
argument
--
that
argument
commenced
a
number
of
years
before.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
about
the
constitutional
arguments
that
are
made
by
many
that
the
court
just
can't
survive
maybe
destroyed
to
their
existence
unless
they
can
kind
of
speak
with
the
contempt
to
criticize
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
remember
they
referred
to
that,
more
than
27
years
ago.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
a
finding
on
what
is
this
based,
or
the
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
think
it
is
a
common
ordinary
thing
for
a
man
to
think
that
someone
else
who's
vowed
to
disagree,
it's
been
viewed
that
he's
filing
the
old
either
has
to
be
decided
fully.
how
are
you
going
to
get
down
into
the
knowledge
to
what
a
man
absolutely
uses
in
the
(voice
overlap).
i
--
what's
the
reason
to
ask,
what
are
the
facts
on
which
he
basis
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i'm
talking
about
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
far
as
it
is
truthful
that
he
say
that
because
the
man
said
it
and
kept
repeating
it,
it
is
bound
to
be
a
falter?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he's
taking
judicial
knowledge
of
that
that
he
had
some
evidence
on
which
to
base
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
sounds
like
you've
covered
that
in
new
orleans,
to
the
people
who
never
exaggerated
political
rights
among
themselves.
justice
hugo
l.

your
judges

does
the
word
racketeer
means
there
general?
what
were

talking
about?
justice
hugo
l.

black
which
is
--
is
it
his
view

him
of
that
vice
in
crime?
justice
hugo

depended
on
the
district
attorney
for
that,

justice

black
i
then
try
to
ask
you,

went
away
on
vacation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
believe
of
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
that
he
claims
in
his
argument
he's
not
going
to
stop.

not
going
to
stop

justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
wanted
to
get
that,
that's
part
of
the
record,
if
you
could
get
to
that
immediately.
justice

did
i
understand
you
to
say?
justice

black
that's
what
he
thought
of.
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
of
the
judges
called
you
and
to
audit
you
to
prosecute
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
didn't
have
to
do
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
would
have
the
same
time
to
get
to
you
that
they're
reasonably
charged
with.
they
had
the
right
to
use
the

--
what
they
wanted
you
to
do
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
has
not
refused

had
this
man
been
elected?
justice

l.
black
the
record
--
justice
hugo

did
the
record
show
whether
he
ran
on
a
platform
of
doing
this
which
he
says
he
was
trying
to
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
statement
was
what
the
people
used
they
called
to
proceed
but
they
won't
admit
it
at
least
that
they
were
bad
people
and
he
was
a
good
man.
