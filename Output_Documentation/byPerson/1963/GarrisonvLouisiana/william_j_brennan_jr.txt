justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
deutsch,
does
the
jury
trial
demand
predicated
on
a
federal
constitutional
claim?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
mean
in
terms,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
--
you're
speaking
about
cases
that
we
have
on
the
argument
this
--
this
week
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
speaking
of
the
cox
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
statements
on
the
argument
list
this
week?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
demonstration
before
the
courthouse
and
so
forth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
i
think
you
said
that
through
out
of
that
instance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
and
--
there's
been
since
a
supreme
court
decision
sparing
on
the
use
of
the
defamation
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
what's
that
opinion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
it
published
somewhere?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
let
me
have
that
number
again.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
anyway,
can
we
get
copies
of
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
sure
the
attorney
general
is
indicating
we
can
get
them.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
suggested
something
like
that
in
the
times
opinion,
didn't
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you're
saying
is
that
an
actual
malice
test
as
we
defined
actual
malice
in
times,
would
not
say
that
criminal
prosecution
if
it's
for
defamation
of
a
public
official.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
on
the
ground
that
that's
a
seditious
libel
law
and
that
whatever
maybe
the
status
of
civil
libel
suits,
the
first
amendment
precludes
in
the
criminal
prosecution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
actually,
it
doesn't
--
am
i
--
i
forgotten,
but
i
had
the
impression
that
this
statute
makes
truth
in
all
defense
if
in
fact,
the
defamatory
statement
is
made
within
a
will,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
i'm
just
wondering
if
on
the
face
of
it
to
that
extent,
this
statute
isn't
inconsistent.
assuming
now
the
times'
actual
malice
test
defies
a
criminal
prosecution,
isn't
this
statute
on
its
face
inconsistent
with
that
constitution
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
didn't
we?
i
thought
we
said
it
held
to
--
to
the
civil,
to
the
extent
that
it
was
proof
of
actual
malice
as
we
defined
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they're
all
--
they're
all
listed
in
the
footnote
and
including
here
--
go
on.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then
we
went
on
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
but
then
we
went
on
to
hold
it,
did
we
not?
that
nevertheless,
state
libel
laws
are
available
to
the
public
officials
if
he
can
prove
actual
malice
as
we
defined
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
hold
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
yes,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
mr.
deutsch,
that's
the
--
notion
where
he
can't
stand
the
heat,
stay
out
of
the
kitchen.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
mr.
gremillion,
the
times
case
defined
actual
malice
--
actual
malice
as
a
knowingly
false
statement
or
a
state
that
in
fact
false
made
in
reckless
disregard
in
the
field.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
as
may
i
ask
a
question
please?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
your
statute,
as
i
understand
it,
if
the
statement
is
in
fact
true,
there
maybe
a
criminal
prosecution
if
ill-will
toward
the
person
to
defamed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
true.
i
know
but
isn't
that
inconsistent
with
the
times?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
an
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
--
let
me
ask
you
the
questions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
the
times
case
rest,
because
i
think
it
does,
on
the
falsity
basically
of
the
--
of
the
statement
that
to
be
defamatory.
that
is
the
test
even
of
false
statement.
it's
not
the
subject
of
a
civil
libel
act
unless
the
false
statement
was
made,
knowing
it
was
false
or
in
reckless
disregard
whether
it
was
true
or
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
under
your
statute,
as
i
understand
it,
even
a
statement
in
fact
true
may
be
prosecuted
if
the
--
one
making
the
statement
makes
it
with
ill-will
toward
the
person
defamed,
isn't
that
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
malice
in
the
sense
mr.
attorney
general
of
--
that
he
knew
the
statements
which
be
proved
in
fact
to
be
false
--
were
false
when
he
made
them
or
that
he
made
them
in
reckless
disregard
whether
they
were
true
or
false.
where
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
that
evidence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page
did
you
say?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
--
mr.
attorney
general,
i
think
i'm
correct
that
even
before
our
constitution,
england
had
introduced
the
jury
trial
requirements
as
they
safeguard
against
abuse
of
criminal
libel.does
that
have
any
relevance
for
us
in
interpreting
the
first
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
think
i
asked
as
for
the
first
amendment,
do
that
have
any
significance
for
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
my
question
is
in
fact
--
isn't
that
something
we're
going
to
decide
in
this
very
case?
maybe
the
first
time
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
the
constitution
entitled
him
to
a
jury
trial,
he
didn't
get
it
although
he
insisted
on
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what's
the
significance
of
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
didn't
understand
you
say
--
what's
the
significance
of
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
actually
was
the
penalty?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
four
months.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
was
the
exception
to
that
denial
taken
under
the
federal
constitution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
federal
constitution
again?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
this
is
not
really
a
criminal
contempt,
is
it?
the
statute
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
--
malice
is
an
ingredient
of
the
offense,
is
it?
i
know
it
says
malicious
publications.
that's
what
it
said
in
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
making
any
attack
upon
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
of
malice?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
forgive
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
like
the
fact
if
i
may
for
one
second
on
this
malice,
but
is
it
your
suggestion
that
the
way
the
court
phrased
that
where
it
conceded
for
the
purposes
of
argument
that
he
did
have
a
reasonable
belief.
that
the
court
is
suggesting
that
as
he
did
in
fact
of
--
and
he
finally
get
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
here
i
am.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
it
says
it
could
not
have
reasonably
had
on
the
honest
reasonable
belief.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
i
want
to
get
to
was
this.
if
we
should
agree
with
you
at
least
this
suggests
an
ingredient
which
is
contrary
to
the
test
stated
in
the
times
case.
would
that
entitled
you
to
a
reversal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
that
time
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
on
this
ground
alone,
you
think
it
was.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
only
assuming
from
what
you've
suggested
that
we
should
agree
with
you,
that
the
malice
test
is
that
where
this
statute
as
it
was
in
the
times
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
assumption,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is
whether
you
think
there
is
a
sufficient
departure
from
the
time
of
the
test
of
malice
that
you'd
be
entitled
on
that
ground
alone
assuming
that
times
testified
to
a
reversal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
do
think?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
limiting
this
now.
this
argument
is
limited
to
public
officials?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
but
is
your
argument
base
that
this
is
a
sedition
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
it's
involved
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
criticism
of
public
official?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
attorney
general,
is
it
conceivable
that
he
dissent
these
things
that
they
were
not
in
office?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
he
have
made
the
statements
that
these
men
were
not
in
office
as
judges?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
said
it
would
be
unanimous
vote
or
(laughter)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
just
ask
mr.
attorney
general?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
this
at
259,
this
association
of
armed
robbers,
that's
not
part
of
the
charge
on
which
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
only
goes
to
malice,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
i'm
still
quite
--
well,
only
the
issue
of
malice
and
not
to
any
charge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
think
that
there
are
statements
in
louisiana
made
about
judges
of
the
state
and
federal,
aren't
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally
mr.
attorney
general,
have
all
these
other
prosecutions
under
the
facts
that
you've
mentioned?
have
there
been
constitutions
with
statements
about
other
public
officials,
you
mentioned
one
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
--
and
these
other
prosecutions,
they
also
were
--
were
statements
about
public
officials?
