justice
potter
stewart
well,
what's
your
definition
of
seditious
libel?
justice
potter
stewart
even
in
his
personal
capacity.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
have
you
said
--
what
have
you
said
in
the
same
breadth
that
he's
a
very
fine
judge
but
he's
a
notorious
adultery.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
just
lightning
to
make
sure
i
understand
your
point.
is
it
that
there
--
that
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
protects
anyone
from
prosecution
who
libels
or
slanders
any
public
official
in
any
manner?
justice
potter
stewart
but
say
he
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
say
he's
a
--
he's
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
he's
eventually
count
one
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
cheats
on
the
golf
course,
he
cheats
his
friends
every
saturday
when
he
plays
golf.
justice
potter
stewart
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
general
--
general
--
justice
potter
stewart
general
gremillion,
your
statute
does
apply
doesn't
it?
even
if
the
expression
or
publication
is
true
if
--
if
the
actual
malice
can
be
proved.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
second
paragraph
of
section
48,
and
you
said
yes
to
that
question
at
least
six
times
(inaudible).
second
paragraph
of
section
48.
justice
potter
stewart
but
why
is
that
--
in
my
other
places
on
page
3
of
the
appellant's
brief,
the
second
paragraph.
that's
the
one
to
which
reference
has
been
made.
and
it
--
well,
here's
what
it
says,
"where
such
a
publication
or
expression
is
true,
actual
malice
must
be
proved
in
order
to
convict
the
offender."
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
should
you
say
set
himself
two
goals?
justice
potter
stewart
okay.
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
the
only
source
of
funds
to
enable
a
district
attorney
to
make
investigation?
justice
potter
stewart
they're
personnel
paid
by
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
his
--
his
own
salary
doesn't
depend
upon
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
a
term
each
turn?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
was
first
elected
in
19
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
but
so
he's
now
serving
his
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
was
then
and
he's
now
serving
his
first
elective
term.
justice
potter
stewart
page
7
and
8
of
your
brief,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
timely
demand
for
a
jury
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now
the
trial
judge
did
say
--
he
said
it
is
inconceivable
to
me
that
the
defendant
could
have
had
a
reasonable
belief
which
could
be
defined
as
an
honest
belief
that
not
one
but
all
eight
of
these
judges
of
the
criminal
district
court
were
guilty
of
what
he
charged
them
with
as
a
defamatory
statement.
well,
you
say
he
didn't
characterized
that
as
a
finding
but
he
said
that's
certainly
is
a
very
clear
cut
conclusion,
that
the
--
that
the
defendant
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
was
not
telling
the
truth
and
knew
that
he
was
not
telling
the
truth.
that's
the
finding,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
he
said,
“i
could
not
escape
the
conclusion.”
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
he
says
“i
can
only
conclude.”
justice
potter
stewart
he'd
made
no
findings
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
in
view
of
that
finding
by
the
trial
court
which
i
gather,
you
don't
specifically
take
issue
with,
why
isn't
--
why
isn't
that
malice?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
it
too?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
--
and
you
say
so
here?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
just
going
to
the
trial
court's
finding
that
the
defendant
knew
what
he
said
--
that
what
the
defendant
said
was
false
and
that
the
defendant
knew
it
was
false.
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
they
were
vacation-minded.
justice
potter
stewart
was
anybody's
--
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
almost
half
way
down
the
page.
justice
potter
stewart
“i
have
no
allies
because
the
other
officials
are
the
association
of
armed
robbers,”
on
page
259,
almost
half
of
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
boy
tried
for
--
under
your
criminal
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
who
was
he
talking
about?
justice
potter
stewart
who
was
he
talking
about?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
it's
a
--
is
there
any
difference
whether
this
statement,
they
maybe
run
and
attacked
upon
these
judges
in
their
official
rather
than
their
personal
character?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
that
it
attacked
upon
them
solely
and
exclusively
in
their
official
capacity?
