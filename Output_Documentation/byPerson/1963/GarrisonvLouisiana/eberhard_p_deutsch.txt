mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
will
be
recalled
that
the
appellant
in
this
case
is
the
district
or
prosecuting
attorney
for
the
parish
of
orleans
which
is
coextensive
with
the
city
of
new
orleans.
that
when
he
took
office
something
over
two
years
ago,
he
launched
an
attack
on
a
backlog
of
criminal
cases
awarding
--
awaiting
trial
and
at
the
same
time
embarked
on
a
campaign
against
commercialized
vice
in
the
bourbon
street
district
of
new
orleans.
that
a
dispute
arose
between
himself
and
the
judges
of
the
criminal
court
after
he
had
been
in
office
for
sometime
as
to
his
use
of
certain
funds
for
these
vice
investigation
conditions
that
the
judges
adapted
a
rule
that
five
of
them
would
have
to
concur
in
approving
his
vouchers
for
these
expenses
as
against
the
statute
which
provided
that
any
one
judge
could
do
it.
that
they
then,
adapted
a
further
rule
allowing
him
no
further
expenses
for
that
purpose
out
of
this
fund
that
a
recently
retired
judge
made
a
derogatory
statement
concerning
him,
which
was
published
in
the
press
that
he
was
asked
to
--
by
reporters
if
he
had
any
comment
to
make
and
in
reply,
made
the
statement
which
is
the
issue
of
this
criminal
proceeding
for
defamation
under
the
louisiana
defamation
statute.
he
stated
that
the
judges
were
themselves
responsible
for
the
backlog
of
cases
that
they
were
not
working,
that
they
were
taking
excessive
vacations,
that
they
were
endeavoring
specifically
to
block
his
investigations
of
commercialized
vice
which
"raises
interesting
questions
about
the
racketeer
influences
on
our
eight
vacation-minded
judges".
and
this
proceeding
arose
out
of
that
on
a
petition
by
the
judges
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
state,
requesting
him
to
institute
criminal
proceedings,
charges
against
the
appellant
under
the
louisiana
criminal
defamation
statute.
and
on
the
same
day
that
he
did
that,
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
appointed
the
judge
from
another
district
to
hear
the
case.
trial
by
jury
was
denied.
motion
for
trial
by
jury
was
denied
under
the
louisiana
statute
which
provides
the
juries
are
not
to
be
used
in
misdemeanor
cases,
this
thing
a
misdemeanor.
and
his
place
properly
presented
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
were
overruled.
he
was
found
guilty
and
the
judge
said
if
he
would
be
less
than
frank,
if
he
did
not
say
that
the
defamatory
statement
might
not
have
been
issued
without
some
provocation
and
under
the
mitigating
circumstances,
as
the
judge
quoted,
fine
--
levity
fine
of
$1000
or
in
the
alternative,
a
jail
sentence
of
four
months.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
if
--
when
it
was
on
the
federal
constitution,
yes,
because
the
louisiana
constitution
specifically
provides
that
you
may
not
have
a
jury
in
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
it
was
--
it
was
predicated
on
the
sixth
amendment
actually.
it
should
probably
have
been
predicated
on
the
first
and
fourteenth,
that's
the
position
we
take
here.
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
did,
specifically,
passed
on
the
point
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
furnish
a
jury
in
this
case
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment.
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
affirmed
the
conviction
passing
on
the
specific
constitutional
issues
which
had
been
raised
and
relying
primarily
on
this
court's
opinion
in
beauharnais
versus
illinois
that
libelous
utterances
are
not
within
the
area
of
constitutionally
protected
speech.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
yes,
sir.
there,
the
judges
and
he
have
made
up
if
that's
of
any
interest,
at
least
six
of
them.
they're
getting
along
fine
now
and
each
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
no.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
pardon?
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
understand
it
has
been
that
it's
very
difficult
to
furnish
adequate
statistics.
i've
been
interested
in
asking
that
question
myself
because
the
--
for
instance,
the
result
of
this
vice
campaigns
has
increased
the
docket
considerably.
and
to
make
it
up
statistics
which
are
meaningful
is
difficult.
there
are
still
many
cases
on
the
docket
but
the
--
there
have
been
many
more
cases
tried
than
ever
before.
for
the
first
time
in
history,
the
judges
are
now
holding
court
regularly
on
fridays
which
they
were
not
doing.
they
are
holding
--
they
are
trying
jury
cases
at
times
when
they
were
not
trying
them
before.
they
have
cut
down
this
vacation
period
which
the
record
shows,
arose
in
1921
before
there
was
air
conditioning
in
the
new
orleans.
it
was
just
too
difficult
to
get
these
cases
tried
in
a
non
air
--
air
conditioned
courtroom.
but
now,
the
courtrooms
were
air
conditioned
but
empty
while
the
jail
is
not
air
conditioned,
were
filling
up
rapidly
and
so
on
and
so
on.
that
condition
has
improved
tremendously.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
pardon?
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
no,
he
remains
and
--
he
was
elected,
i
think
for
four
years
and
his
term
has
only
ran
something
over
two
years
at
this
time.
now,
in
the
--
there
have
been
other
elections
down
there
in
which
he
has
been
involved
as
between
the
judges
and
himself.
i
suppose
that
maybe
an
answer
to
your
question.
he's
been
successful.
he's
had
popular
support
for
this
campaign.
now,
the
--
in
this
new
york
times
case,
the
beauharnais
case
was
at
least
distinguished
with
the
statement
that
the
constitution
does
not
protect
libelous
publications,
do
not
--
there
is
--
that
the
statement
in
the
beauharnais
case
to
that
effect,
do
not
foreclose
inquiry
into
cases
which
might
involve
the
use
of
libel
laws
to
impose
sanctions
upon
expressions,
critical
of
the
official
conduct
of
public
official.
now,
that
brings
up
something
that's
not
in
the
briefs.
it
just
happened
a
few
days
ago.
but
there's
been
another
or
there
have
been
two
other
prosecutions
in
louisiana
under
the
statute
very
recently.
one
of
the
cases
or
at
least
a
forerunner
up,
one
of
those
cases
is
on
this
court's
docket.
i
think
its
numbers
24
and
49.
they're
coming
up
as
a
part
of
this
set
of
cases
now,
cox
versus
the
state
of
louisiana.
now,
arising
out
of
that
case,
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana,
a
few
days
ago,
denied
a
rehearing.
and
i
think
this
is
particularly
significant
in
two
cases
involving
prosecutions
under
the
same
defamation
statute.
a
negro
minister
was
stated
to
have
defamed
a
court,
that's
a
judge,
and
the
district
attorney
in
baton
rouge,
louisiana,
by
casting
aspersions
on
the
court's
conduct
with
regard
to
prosecution
of
negroes.
and
he
was
prosecuted
under
the
defamation
statute,
convicted,
fined
in
each
case,
the
full
limit
of
the
--
allowed
under
the
statute
of
$3000
plus
one
year
in
jail
on
each
case,
making
two
years
plus
$6000
and
then
required
to
serve
an
additional
two
years
if
he
didn't
pay
the
$6000.
now,
the
case
came
up
to
the
supreme
court
which
wrote
a
considerable
dissertation
on
the
effect
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
new
york
times
case,
stating
that
its
defamation
statute
was
entirely
valid
and
this
prosecution
was
entirely
valid
under
that
statute
but
reversed,
and
then
after
that,
in
a
short
part
of
the
decision,
reversed
the
decision
on
the
grounds
that
the
district
attorney
had
not
recused
himself
because
he
was
in
a
sense,
a
party
to
this
prosecution.
what
i'm
getting
at
is,
that
this
is
being
used.
the
statute
is
being
used
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
the
--
numbers
24
and
49
on
the
docket
of
this
court
right
now,
is
the
case
out
of
which
this
prosecution
group.
the
citation
of
the
case
is
state
of
louisiana
versus
cox,
c-o-x,
b.
elton
cox.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
no,
no.
well,
look
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
the
prior
case
is
number
24,
the
case
out
of
which
the
prosecution
arose.
the
prosecution
for
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
pardon
me?
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that's
right.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
right.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that
does
not
bring
up
this
defamation
prosecution.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that's
correct.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
actually
directly
involving
the
defamation.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
now,
that
opinion
is
number
--
well,
it
was
decided
on
june
8
of
1964.
it's
number
47018
of
the
docket
of
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
it's
not
yet
published.
rehearing
was
denied
october
7,
just
10
days
ago.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
47018.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
yes.
well,
if
you
all
would
give
me
time,
i'd
arrived
in
the
united
states
yesterday
morning
from
a
long
absent
and
i
will
put
this
in
the
form
if
you
like
it,
with
supplemental
brief.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
no,
i
have
no
doubt
on
that.
there
must
be
copies
available
--
i
have
only
one
copy.
i'll
be
glad
to
print
it
up
and
file
it
for
the
court,
if
necessary.
but
it
--
it
demonstrates,
i
submit,
the
frightful
use
to
which
a
statute
of
this
--
of
this
sort
can
be
put.
a
man
is
sentenced
to
two
years
in
jail,
to
pay
a
fine
of
$6000
and
an
additional
two
years
if
he
doesn't
pay
the
$6000
because
he
used
language.
however,
strong
it
may
have
been
reflecting
on
the
judge
and
district
attorney,
and
it
happens
to
involve
the
identical
statute.
now,
james
--
i
--
i
skim
over
a
great
of
deal
this,
simply
in
the
hope
of
getting
questions.
we've
been
through
it
from
top
to
bottom.
i
think
--
i
call
the
attention
of
the
fact
that
james
madison
who
literally
drew
the
first
amendment
with
his
own
hand
said
that
it
would
be
a
mockery
to
state
that
you
could
not
have
laws
preventing
publications
and
still
have
laws
punishing
them
when
made.
our
position
is
simply
--
certainly
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
that
when
a
statute
of
this
sort
is
used
to
support
seditious
libel,
it
is
invalid
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
now
--
or
we
could
go
further
of
course
and
apply
it
to
all
libel.
i
could
go
further
and
say
that
a
jury
trial
is
an
indispensable
necessity
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
carried
over
from
the
sixth
just
as
this
court
has
recently
been
rendering
its
decisions
taking
the
federal
bill
of
rights
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
a
jury
trial
is
just
as
much
necessary
as
a
matter
of
due
process
in
a
state
court
as
it
is
in
a
federal
court.
i
don't
have
to
do
that
in
this
case
because
in
my
opinion,
the
history
of
prosecutions
for
contempt
clearly
indicate
that
a
man
is
entitled
to
a
trial
by
jury
on
a
defamation
charge
even
if
such
a
defamation
charge
may
be
made
at
all
with
regard
to
a
public
official.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
putting
it
very
succinctly,
defamation
of
a
government
official,
of
a
public
official.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
perhaps
not
but
it's
almost
impossible
to
separate
the
two.
for
instance,
if
i
say
one
of
the
judges
of
this
court
took
a
bribe
that
reflects
on
his
--
both
his
official
and
his
personal
character.
if
i
say
that
racketeering
influences
are
brought
to
bear
effectively
on
a
judge,
i
don't
think
you
can
separate
that
from
his
personal
--
from
his
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
i
would
take
it
that
adultery
is
not
a
characteristic
of
judges
and
accordingly,
that
would
be
--
it
would
refer
to
his
personal
rather
than
his
judicial
capacity.
i
think
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
--
you've
got
the
extreme
in
there.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
would
think
not.
it
--
i
--
i
can
concede
if
i
sort
of
used
my
imagination
enough
that
it
might
have
something
to
do
where
the
casing
was
trying
or
something
of
that
sort.
but
by
enlarge,
i
think
there
is
a
distinction
but
i
--
there
is
a
very
broad
shadow
zone,
i
put
it
that
way.
it's
aptly
hard
to
say
that
a
judge
in
a
--
is
subject
to
racketeering
influences
and
then
say
in
the
same
breadth
that
that
does
not
refer
to
his
official
capacity.
i
wouldn't
--
i
--
i
can't
conceive
with
that.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
may
i
discuss
that
briefly
for
a
moment.
you
will
find
references
to
--
to
that
all
through
his
opinion
and
his
rulings.
he
admitted
evidence
to
show
malice
of
prior
statements,
subsequent
statements
and
so
on
and
so
on.
and
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
at
this
most
recent
decision
probably
goes
a
little
further.
it's
an
analysis
of
the
new
york
times
case
as
applied
to
this
case,
and
takes
about
8
or
10
pages
to
do
that.
and
then
it
says
we
reverse
anyway,
i
mean
its
dictum
clearly.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that
--
that
is
my
position
period.
but
i
don't
have
to
go
that
far,
the
one
maclennan
case
if
i
can
do
it.
now,
there
was
no
actual
malice
within
the
meaning
of
this
--
of
the
times
case
and
i
would
like
to
quote
a
few
words
from
the
trial
judges'
opinion
which
i
don't
think
are
in
the
brief,
but
on
page
633
of
the
record.
what
he
said
was,
"i
cannot
believe
that
this
man
could've
had
an
honest
belief
that
what
he
was
saying
that
true,"
he
said
that.
then
he
said,
"however,
even
where
it
conceded
for
the
purposes
of
argument
that
he
did
have
a
reasonable
belief
as
to
the
truth
of
the
statement.
i
am
still
of
the
opinion
that
the
state
has
proved
actual
malice.
now,
he's
got
a
complete
contradiction
insofar
as
this
court's
statement
in
the
times
case
goes,
that
actual
malice
involves
a
necessary
knowledge
that
his
statement
was
untrue
or
a
reckless,
disregarded
the
truth.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
633,
sir.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
pardon
me.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
i
don't
think
--
no,
no.
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
sir,
under
my
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
still
say
that
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment,
there
can
be
no
such
as
thing
as
seditious
libel.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
could
go
further
with
mr.
justice
black
but
i
don't
have
to
for
this
case.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
don't'
make
that
statement.
i'm
willing
to
make
it,
i
believe
it.
but
for
the
purpose
of
this
sake,
there
maybe
--
i
say
it
for
the
purpose
of
this
case.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that's
it.
that's
my
statement
for
the
purpose
of
this
case.
i'm
willing
to
go
further.
these
criminal
libel
laws
are
now
being
used
as
i've
demonstrated
in
the
brief
and
a
columbia
law
review
article.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
he
can
make
the
showing
of
actual
malice
as
defined
by
this
court.
he
may
under
the
latest
decision
of
the
majority
of
this
court,
recover
damage.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
the
vast
difference
between
using
these
statutes
for
blackmail
in
criminal
prosecution.
although,
when
you
start
giving
judgments
for
$500,000
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
--
or
$3,000,000,
you're
doing
even
worse
i
suppose,
except
for
the
jail
sentence
part,
you're
going
to
worsen
the
points
which
are
all
was
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
the
times
opinion.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
pardon?
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
oh,
i
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
--
i
do
say
the
overall
rule
of
the
times
case
does
not
apply
to
a
criminal
prosecution
that
there
may
be
no
such
thing
as
a
criminal
prosecution
or
defamation
of
a
public
official
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
should
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
do
say
that
and
i
add
to
it
as
anchor
to
winword
that
there
was
no
proof
of
actual
malice
in
the
sense
in
which
this
court
applied
it
in
this
case
anyway.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
in
this
new,
you'll
find
a
rather
lengthy
discussion
of
that
point.
that
is
correct,
but
you
will
find
a
discussion
of
it
in
this
latest
decision
which
i
have
just
given
you
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
don't
think
there
is
the
slightest
question
about
it
on
that
truth
point.
there's
no
question
whatever
applied.
now,
the
court
says,
"there's
no
proof
of
truth
of
--
of
this
charge
in
this
particular
case."
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
i'd
say
that
for
this
purpose,
and
i
don't
want
to
get
into
your
adultery
case.
i
mean
i
don't
want
to
get
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
--
of
an
attention
off.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
certainly
in
his
capacity
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
--
as
a
government
official.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well
again,
you're
within
that
shadows
on
because
a
man
who
do
that
isn't
fit
to
whole
public
office.
i
--
you
see,
the
shadows
on
is
so
broad
to
me
that
there
is
almost
no
way
of
separating
a
man's
personal
character
from
his
public
character.
if
he
has
a
--
a
bad
personal
character,
he's
not
fit
to
serve
the
public.
no.
i
--
i
can't
go
all
the
way
with
you.
i
mean
there
are
some
things
that
--
well,
let's
say
gentlemen
don't
call
wise,
others
do.
i
--
i
say
you
can
go
way
off
an
attention
on
this
question
and
i'm
trying
to
avoid
that.
but
when
you
speak
in
realities
as
we're
doing
in
this
case
about
stating
that
a
judge
is
subject
to
racketeer
influences,
a
judge
is
subject,
you're
not
saying
john
doe.
then
the
judges
of
this
court
are
subject
to
racketeer
influences.
you're
not
off
even
in
the
shadow
zone.
that's
clearly
in
his
public
official
--
his
capacity
as
a
public
official.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
yes.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that
the
opinion
of
this
court
is
contrary
to
that
sir.
that
--
that
dictum
of
mr.
chief
justice
hughes
in
the
near
case
was
clearly
overruled
in
the
times
case.
i
read
that
actual
language.
it
says,
"those
decisions
no
longer
--
they
--
as
the
beauharnais
and
other
decisions
saving
libel."
chief
justice
hughes
that
the
public
official
always
has
his
remedy
under
the
civil
and
criminal
libel
laws,
that's
the
effect
to
what
he
said.
now,
this
court
said
in
the
times
case
that
doesn't
hold
anymore,
oh
on.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
let
me
read
what
it
said.
i'll
get
the
--
i
think
it
was
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
in
the
new
york
time
case,
this
court
held
that
its
prior
statements
in
the
beauharnais
and
other
cases
that
includes
the
merit
near
case.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
to
the
effect
that
the
constitution
does
not
protect
libelous
publication
do
not
foreclose
inquiry
into
cases
which
might
involve
the
use
of
libel
laws
to
impose
sanctions
upon
expressions
criticized
of
--
critical
of
the
official
conduct
of
public
official.
well
now,
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
but
mr.
justice
hughes
didn't
leave
that
kind
of
an
opening
in
his
decision.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
if
you
hold
that,
i
--
i
say
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
you
held
it
only
for
the
purpose
of
civil
libel.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
and
i
say
that
there
is
a
significant
distinction
between
taking
this
negro
preacher
and
given
him
four
years
in
jail
or
saying
that
they're
not
being
treated
right
by
the
judge
and
the
prosecuting
attorney.
and
giving
somebody
a
right
to
sue
for
some
actual
damages
under
those
circumstances,
i
--
i
make
that
distinction
very
frankly.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
i
didn't
mean
to
put
it
in
a
--
a
form
of
a
libel
except
that
--
i
meant
that
the
libel
had
a
meaning.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
now,
the
bidding
you
will
find
for
instance
in
john
stuart
mill,
which
was
quoted,
i
think
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
the
times
case,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
who
said
that
in
the
broad
field
of
public
affairs,
that
is
part
of
the
game.
he
said
that
a
long
time
ago,
that
people
unquestionably
fail
to
tell
the
truth
from
time-to-time
and
know
they're
doing
it
but
they
do
it
during
the
course
of
public
discussion
and
that
in
a
democracy
like
that
of
the
united
states,
does
not
give
a
cause
of
action,
certainly,
a
criminal
cause
of
action."
now,
that's
what
i
mean
by
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
exactly.
i'll
go
all
the
way
on
that.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
think
it
was
intended
by
the
framers
of
the
first
amendment
that
that
should
be
the
case.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
exactly.
i
think
that's
part
of
public
life
in
a
democracy,
and
i
think
it's
a
good
thing
that
it
is.
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
few
moments
for
rebuttal.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
really
just
say
one
thing
in
connection
with
the
matter
of
the
jury
trial.
fox's
libel
act
in
england
was
1792
and
undoubtedly
the
discussion
which
formulated
itself
into
fox's
libel
act
was
part
that
went
into
the
first
amendment.
at
least
that
is
the
--
that
is
my
honest
conviction.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
oh
many
years.
that
had
been
going
on
since
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
--
before
william
penn
was
tried
and
so
on.
yes,
sir.
that
--
that
was
a
--
accumulation
which
is
just
as
much
a
part
of
the
history
of
the
first
amendment
as
it
is
a
fox's
libel
act
itself.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
appellant
is
the
district
or
prosecuting
attorney
for
the
parish
of
orleans,
which
is
coterminous
with
the
city
of
new
orleans,
louisiana.
he
was
inducted
into
office
about
two
years
ago
and
following
that
induction,
set
himself
two
goals.
first
was
an
intensive
attack
to
that
fact
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
yes.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
first,
was
an
intensive
attack
on
a
backlog
of
criminal
cases
awaiting
disposition
and
the
second
was
a
campaign
against
commercialized
vice
in
new
orleans
bourbon
street
section.
under
louisiana
law,
all
fines
and
forfeitures
in
criminal
cases
go
into
a
special
fund
under
the
control
of
the
district
attorney
for
the
payment
of
the
expenses
of
his
office
and
certain
expenses
of
the
criminal
courts
and
he
may
make
expenditures
from
that
fund
under
the
appropriate
statute
on
the
approval
of
a
judge
of
the
court.
such
funds
had
always
been
used
to
pay
for
investigations
made
by
the
district
attorney
on
approval
by
a
single
judge
and
that
applied
to
his
predecessors
in
office,
and
it
applied
to
him
during
the
first
few
months
of
his
incumbents.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
there
is
a
provision
under
which
he
is
supplied
with
police
officers
by
the
city
of
new
orleans.
they
are
not
funds,
which
he
uses
for
that
purpose.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
personnel
paid
by
the
city
is
made
available
to
him.
aside
from
that
--
this,
--
well,
actually
that
is
not
a
fund
given
to
him
for
that
purpose.
this
is
the
only
front
as
such.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
no.
no,
his
salary
is
a
state
salary
pay.
this
is
for
what
we
might
call
incidental
expenses,
sending
people
to
an
extradition
matters
to
other
states
and
the
thing
for
furnishings
of
the
office
and
actually
for
the
officers
of
the
judges
and
so
on
and
so
on.
a
short
time
later,
however,
the
judges
met
en
banc
and
adopted
a
rule,
there
are
eight
of
these
judges,
adopted
a
rule
under
which
such
expenditures
would
not
be
approved
except
on
the
concurrence
of
five
of
the
eight
judges.
and
not
long
thereafter,
they
discontinued
altogether
the
approval
of
the
expenditures
for
vice
investigation.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
this
was
some
months,
five
or
six
months
after
he
took
office.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
four
years
i
think.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
--
62.
well,
he
took
office
i
think
in
may
1962.
we
have
a
kind
of
an
irregular
system
of
the
elections.
we
have
primarily
primaries.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
he
is
now
serving.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
correct.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
a
few
days
later
after
this
fund
was
cut
off,
one
of
the
recently
retired
judges
of
that
court
made
a
statement
to
the
press
charging
appellant
with
responsibility
for
the
backlog
of
these
untried
cases.
he
had
been
an
officer,
as
i
say,
a
few
months
at
that
time.
on
the
following
day,
the
newspaper
reporters
came
to
him
and
asked
if
he
had
any
comment
to
make
about
this
statement
and
it
was
in
response
to
that
request
that
he
made
the
statement,
which
is
the
subject
of
this
litigation.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
had
recently
retired,
just
recently
retired.
he
was
actually
in
office
when
appellant
took
office
as
district
attorney.
he
retired
between
that
time
and
the
time
of
this
incident.
now,
appellant
said
in
answer
to
this
statement
by
this
judge
in
substance
that
it
was
the
judges
who
were
responsible
for
the
backlog
of
untried
criminal
cases
that
they
had
been
been
taking
excessive
vacations,
that
they
were
endeavoring
to
block
his
vice
investigations,
and
that
their
attitude
and
now
i
quote,
may
it
please
the
court,
“raises
interesting
questions
about
the
racketeer
influences
on
our
eight
vacation-minded
judges.”
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
it's,
yes.
it's
--
but
that's
not
in
full
in
our
brief.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
if
you
will
look
at
page
27
of
the
transcript,
it
--
it
is
quoted
in
full
27
et.
seq.,
goes
through
to
page
32
at
that
point
given
in
the
text
of
the
indictment
or
rather
the
bill
of
information,
which
was
filed
against
it.
now,
on
petition,
formal
petition
of
the
eight
criminal
court
judges,
the
attorney
general
of
louisiana
filed
a
bill
of
information
charging
appellant
with
criminal
defamation
under
the
louisiana
defamation
statute.
and
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
appointed
a
judge
from
another
district
to
try
the
case.
trial
by
jury
was
denied
under
the
louisiana
constitutional
provision
though
the
effect
that
a
judge
alone
may
try
misdemeanor
cases.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
oh
yes,
formal
motion
on
page
38
of
the
transcript,
and
formally
denied
in
that
point
was
formally
taken
up
on
appeal
and
so
on
to
pass
it
on.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
under
this
particular
statute
$3000
or
one
year
in
jail
or
both.
now,
let
me
say
there
are
apparently
some
mistakes;
one
in
the
record
somewhere
and
one
in
the
attorney
general's
brief
leaving
out
the
word
or
both.
actually,
it
does
show
in
the
original
part
of
the
attorney
general's
brief
but
later
on
it
was
quoted
again
and
apparently
inherent
the
words
“or
both”
are
left
out,
i
think
they're
extremely
significant
in
light
of
the
recent
barnett
decision.
but
it
is
also
left
out
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
unaccountably,
those
two
words
“or
both”.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
pardon?
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
you
know,
you
talk
about
petty
offenses
maybe
heard
without
a
jury.
here
you
have
a
maximum
penalty
of
$3000
or
one
year
in
jail
or
both.
i'd
like
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
you
mean
the
sentence
in
this
case?
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
--
was
a
fine
of
$1000
or
in
default
of
payment
four
months
in
prison.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
now,
as
i
said
trial
by
jury
was
denied
under
this
constitutional
provision
and
a
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
this
was
passed
on
by
the
supreme
court,
again,
on
appeal
in
question.
pardon?
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
oh
yes.
there
is
a
little
--
there's
no
question
raised
about
it
if
the
sixth
amendment
was
mentioned.
and
then
it
says
--
the
motion
says
--
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
are
mentioned
in
that
motion
but
it
also
goes
on
to
say
in
the
alternative
under
the
freedom
of
speech
provisions
also
without
saying
in
so
many
words
the
first
and
fourteenth.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
this
is
not
a
contempt
case
at
all.
this
is
a
criminal
prosecution
for
defamation.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
under
a
specific
state
defamation
statute.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
or
a
misdemeanor
as
i'm
not
--
i
assume
you're
not
making
that
distinction..
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
it
is
a
prosecution
and
it
is
a
--
it
is
a
prosecution
without
a
jury
of
course,
that
sort
of
advances
my
point
a
little
but
i'll
get
to
it
again,
if
i
may.
also
his
place
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
that
this
statute
so
applied
violated
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
with
regard
to
his
right
of
free
speech
was
also
specifically
overruled.
and
again,
it
was
passed
on
by
the
supreme
court
on
appeal
and
so
on.
the
judge
found
the
appellant
guilty,
sentenced
him
to
pay
this
fine
of
a
$1000
or
four
months
in
jail
stating
that
he
did
so
under
the
mitigating
circumstances
of
the
case,
and
that
he
would
be
less
than
frank,
and
i'm
quoting,
“if
he
did
not
say
that
the
defamatory
statement
might
not
have
been
issued
without
some
probable
case.”
well
that
goes
into
this
question
of
malice.
the
supreme
court
affirmed
it
held
in
substance
that
there
was
no
violation
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
on
free
speech
that
they
found
no
provisions
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
requiring
a
trial
by
jury
under
such
circumstances
and
because
louisiana
treats
defamation
and
contempt
as
separate
offenses.
it
is
unnecessary
for
us
to
consider
the
issues
behind
the
phrase
“clear
and
present
danger”
under
the
opinions
of
this
court
which
deal
with
their
--
which
have
dealt
with
the
offense
of
contempt.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that
raises
the
interesting
questions
of
statutory
construction
and
really
it's
not
directly
pertinent
here
because
the
state
took
it
upon
itself
to
prove
that
there
was
malice
without
raising
the
point
whether
it
have
to
do
so
or
not.
and
there
was
a
finding
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
am
insofar
as
that
word
was
given
a
definition
by
this
court
recently
in
the
new
york
times
case.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
you
mean
what
i
have
just
said?
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
this
court
held
in
the
new
york
times
case
that
'actual
malice'
was
a
deliberate
misstatement
of
fact
or
a
reckless
disregard
as
to
its
falsity.
there
is
no
such
finding,
we
submit,
in
this
record.
there
is
a
finding
in
the
words
of
mouths
and
i'll
come
to
that
if
i
may.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
of
malice
under
that
definition.
i
think
i
can
clarify
that
immediately
by
reading
a
short
paragraph
on
page
633
of
the
transcript
from
the
opinion
of
the
trial
court
at
the
first
full
paragraph
at
the
top
of
the
page.
after
making
the
finding
of
malice
on
the
preceding
page,
the
judge
said,
“however
where
it
conceded
for
the
purposes
of
argument
that
he
did
have
a
reasonable
belief
as
to
the
truth
of
the
statement
and
the
statement
was
entitled
to
be
considered
a
qualified
privilege,
i
am
with
the
opinion
that
the
state
has
proved
'actual
malice'
in
its
many
definitions,
et
cetera.”
in
other
words,
even
if
he
had
says
the
reasonable
belof
--
belief
in
the
truth
of
what
he
was
saying,
i
still
find
it
was
actuated
by
malice
that
could
not
be
the
malice
which
this
court
recently
defined.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
when
the
--
under
louisiana
law
as
i
understand
it,
i
trust
you'll
forgive
me,
this
is
first
criminal
case
with
which
i
ever
had
any
connections,
but
as
i
understand
that
any
sentence
of
more
than
one
year
is
not
served
in
the
parish
prison
and
i
think
that
would
straighten
that
out.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
if
i'm
wrong
about
that,
i
will
be
happy
to
stand
corrected.
that's
my
understanding.
but
there
is
no
question
that
a
misdemeanor
is
the
one
that
goes
up
to
one
year.
now,
we
do
submit,
may
it
please
the
court
that
the
validity
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
fine,
surely.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
if
you
will
read
mr.
justice
brennan
on
the
preceding
page
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that
--
towards
the
bottom,
the
long
paragraph
it
says
it
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
he
puts
it
of
course
in
the
form
of
an
inference
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
he
says,
“i
cannot
understand
that
he
could
have
any
other.”
he
doesn't
make
it
a
finding
of
fact.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
and
then
he
goes
on,
“but
even
if
so,
he's
actuated
by
malice
anyway
if
they
should
believe
there
was
truth.”
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
so
he's
not
talking
about
your
kind
of
malice.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
think
that
alone
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
--
look,
but
there
are
many
other
grounds.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
you
see
in
the
times
case,
you
didn't
make
a
finding
with
regard
to
a
criminal
case
at
all.
you
were
talking
about
the
right
to
recover
civil
damages.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
yes,
then
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
stand
on
that,
yes.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
yes
sir.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
of
course,
as
i
was
just
starting
to
say
perhaps
indirectly
in
that
connection,
that
we
do
take
the
position
that
the
application
of
a
state
criminal
libel
statute
especially
when
employed
as
a
sedition
law
with
regard
to
criticism
of
public
official
simply
can't
be
reconciled
at
all
with
the
principles
of
the
first
amendment
passing
through
the
fourteenth
with
regard
to
a
state
statute.
that's
--
that
seems
to
have
been
considerable
controversy
on
that
subject
in
this
court.
i
don't
have
to
go
all
the
way
with
the
proponents
of
that
principle
whatever
my
own
views
are
but
in
this
particular
case,
you've
got
a
general
criminal
libel
statute
being
applied
as
sedition
act.
now,
of
course
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
--
as
far
as
i
have
to
go
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that
this
is
being
applied
as
a
sedition
law.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
criticism
of
public
official
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that's
right.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
of
course,
the
argument
is
made
on
the
other
side
that
it
is
not.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
what
does
our
brief
say?
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
i
don't
think
there
is
a
slightest
question
that
when
you
say
a
judge
took
a
bribe
if
that's
what
you
say
for
instance,
that's
not
involved
in
this
case,
you're
certainly
talking
about
the
judge
in
his
official
capacity,
whatever
reflections
you
may
be
casting
on
his
personal
character.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
oh,
there's
no
bribe
question
here
at
all.
i'm
using
that
for
illustration.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
no,
that
didn't
aim
to
that.
that
i
--
this
raises
interesting
questions
as
to
our
--
whether
our
vacation-minded
judges
are
subject
to
racketeering
influences
or
something
of
that
sort.
he
did
not
say
about
each
and
everyone
unless
you
want
to
read
this
thing
with
great
care,
an
oral
statement
made
to
reporters.
he
said
as
to
whether
our
eight
vacation-minded
judges
are
subject
to
racketeering
influences.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
i
think
perhaps
i
could
best
state
it
by
stating
sir
that
i
stand
with
you
in
your
views
on
that
subject
that's
heretofore
expressed.
i
take
it
i
don't
need
to
elaborate
on
that
statement.
i
should
be
very
happy
to
do
so.
i've
have
read
every
word
written
on
this,
sir.
now,
i
do
say
that
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
was
rendered
of
course
before
the
new
york
times
case.
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
relied
on
the
statement
in
the
beauharnais
and
prior
cases,
which
said
libel
is
not
covered
by
the
first
amendment.
you
ought
to
straighten
that
out,
to
my
satisfaction
in
the
new
york
times
case
stating
that
your
expressions
in
the
beauharnais
and
other
cases
to
the
effect
that
the
constitution
does
not
protect
libelous
publications
do
not
foreclose
inquiry
in
the
cases
which
might
involve
the
use
of
libel
laws
to
impose
sanctions
upon
expressions,
critical
of
the
official
conduct
of
public
officials.
and
incidentally,
mr.
justice
black,
you
have
in
our
brief
a
statement
by
mr.
justice
brewer
which
takes
that
question
about
destruction
of
courts
by
criticism
of
judges
and
applies
it
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
and
says
it
is
--
it
might
be
used
as
a
current
fiction
perhaps
because
it
no
such
thing
could
possibly
exist.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
remember
that
reference
too.
now,
i
do
call
your
attention
if
i
may
to
a
couple
of
matters
which
you
have
not
had
a
case
and
at
least
to
put
into
your
briefs
within
your
opinions
and
which
as
far
as
i
know
have
not
been
in
briefs
before
this
court
in
analogous
cases,
for
instance
that
madison
in
the
virginia
resolutions
on
the
sedition
act
of
1798
that
it
would
seem
a
mockery
to
say
that
no
law
should
be
passed
preventing
publications
from
being
made,
but
that
laws
might
be
passed
for
punishing
them
in
case
they
should
be
made.
it
gets
back
to
this
question
of
previous
restraint
not
being
the
full
scope
of
the
first
amendment.
and
governor
morris
with
regard
to
the
zenger
acquittal
said
that
the
germ
of
american
freedom,
the
morning
star
of
that
liberty
which
subsequently
revolutionized
america.
and
dean
pound
said
the
same
thing.
he
cited
in
an
article,
a
case
of
a
chap
in
england
who
had
been
convicted
for
saying
that
a
certain
justice
of
the
peace
was
“a
baffle-headed
fellow.”
and
dean
pound
says
it
was
that
sort
of
thing
that
led
the
colonies
as
soon
as
they
could
make
a
frame
of
government
for
themselves
into
what
these
provisions
with
reference
to
the
liberty
of
the
press
in
their
bill
of
rights,
a
criticism
of
a
judge
or
justice
of
the
peace
in
that
case.
now
then,
came
the
sedition
act,
the
federalist
ruthless
enforcement
of
its
provisions.
and
then
this
is
something
else
so
far
as
i
know
that
has
never
been
mentioned
in
that
connection.
a
resolution
was
introduced
in
the
house
of
representatives
to
repeal
the
second
section
of
the
sedition
act.
it
was
approved
in
the
house.
it
was
passed
in
the
house
by
a
vote
of
50
to
48
on
the
lone
federalist
vote
of
john
marsh
who
very
nearly
wrecked
his
political
career
by
that
statement
because
he
went
directly
against
this
party.
he
was
the
only
federalist
in
the
congress,
which
had
a
majority
of
federalists,
which
went
along
with
the
repeal
of
the
sedition
law.
now,
in
1940,
attorney
general
robert
h.
jackson
refused
to
institute
a
prosecution
for
criminal
libel
of
a
public
official
under
the
district
of
columbia's
criminal
libel
act
stating
that
that
would
constitute
embarrassment
not
consistent
with
our
support
of
the
freedom
of
the
press
and
it
is
therefore
the
department
of
justice
policy
that
we
do
not
institute
that
kind
of
action.
actually,
on
statistics
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
it
is
shown
that
the
larger
number
of
criminal
libel
actions
recently
instituted
throughout
the
united
states,
have
been
for
libel
of
public
officials
that
is
as
sedition
act.
after
all,
this
court
has
held
uniformly
now
in
a
number
of
leading
cases
that
out
of
court
criticism
of
judges
may
not
be
punished
as
contempt
without
trial
by
jury
and
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
interference
with
the
administration
of
justice.
we
submit
that
you
cannot
change
that
rule
in
a
criminal
libel
prosecution
without
a
jury
simply
by
calling
it,
labeling
it
criminal
libel
or
sedition
instead
of
contempt
of
court.
we
submit
there
is
no
real
difference
there.
now,
the
question
of
malice
is
really
the
only
other
one
whether
this
court
intends
to
substitute
that
rule
for
the
clear
and
present
danger
rule,
which
i'm
sure
it
did
not
in
the
new
york
times
case.
and
--
or
whether
perhaps
it
means
to
add
that
on
to
the
requirements
amongst
the
clear
and
present
danger
rule.
we
submit
that
in
any
event
there
has
not
been
a
finding
of
malice
as
i
stated
a
few
moments
ago
within
the
meaning
of
that
expression
as
used
in
the
new
york
times
case
that
the
prosecution
in
the
case
at
bar
violated
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
that
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
should
be
reversed.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
on
the
question
he
made
that
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
he
said,
“i
cannot
escape
that
inference
of
that
conclusion.”
he
did
not
make
it
a
specific
finding.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
cannot
escape
that
conclusion.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well
that's
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that's
covered
on
that.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well
i
do
take
issue
with
the
--
we
took
issue
with
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
--
on
the
facts,
oh
yes.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
you
all
--
under
your
own
decisions
we'll
examine
the
findings
of
fact
and
we
trace
them
in
the
brief.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
we
say
in
a
controversy
of
this
sort
started
let
us
say
when
the
immediate
purposes,
there
was
staff
preceding
all
of
these
that
i
have
mentioned.
there
were
some
more
afterwards.
if
you
look
for
instance
at
note
3
on
page
6
of
the
supplemental
brief,
our
supplemental
brief,
you'll
find
the
speech
which
he
made
a
couple
--
the
appellant
made
a
couple
of
months
later
talking
about
the
--
these
excess
vacations
of
these
district
judges
and
so
on
that
he
felt
himself
bound
to
tell
the
people
of
new
orleans
the
truth.
the
only
way
he
could
get
the
sacred
cows
backdoor
was
by
informing
the
public
as
to
what
they
were
doing.
now,
a
public
official
under
wood
versus
georgia
and
so
on,
has
a
duty
to
say
those
things
and
in
our
opinion
can't
be
charged
with
malice
perse.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
don't
treat
that
as
a
finding
sir
but
that,
we'll
begin
to
get
in
the
semantics
there,
i
think
it
is
simply
an
inference
on
his
part
and
not
a
formal
finding
but
that
even
if
it
is,
we
find
fault.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
or
there's
evidence,
there's
hundreds
of
pages
of
evidence
here.
there
he
bases
it
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well
the
fact
that
he
made
similar
statements
on
other
occasions
which
showed
that
he
was
repeating
and
that
that
could
be
engendered
only
by
malice.
that's
why
i
call
it
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
--
a
conclusion
rather
than
finding.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
he
made
one
other.
i'm
not
going
to
try
to
say
that
i'm
going
to
give
you
now
all
the
evidence
on
which
that
was
based
because
there's
hundred
--
hundreds
of
pages
of
evidence.
but
for
instance,
he
said
he
couldn't
considerably
have
believed
that
all
of
these
judges
were
subject
to
racketeering
influence
and
he
made
no
exceptions
when
he
made
this
statement.
he
takes
that
for
instance
as
an
indicia
of
malice.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
i
assume
he
knew
the
judges
but
i
assume
also
that
he
tried
this
case
on
the
record.
i
have
not
fault
to
find
whether
he's
going
outside
the
record
for
that
purpose.
i
call
your
attention
in
the
new
york
times
case
to
footnote
--
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
have
an
official
copy
here
but
it's
footnote
13
citing
john
stewart
mill
on
liberty
stating
that
there
just
has
to
be
misstatement
from
time
to
time
in
the
course
of
controversy
in
public
life
and
that
--
that's
not
in
effect
evidence
of
malice
because
it
says
very
fine
people
do
that
from
time
to
time.
now,
if
there
is
any
misstatement
of
fact
here,
in
my
humble
opinion
(voice
overlap)
it
could
be
found
only
by
construing
these
words
in
a
certain
way
in
which
in
my
opinion,
they
were
not
meant
and
i
--
i
just
don't
believe
they
were
meant
to.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
may
i
quote
that
to
the
chamber
of
commerce
(laughter).
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
thank
you.
i
may
have
just
(voice
overlap)
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
just
a
few
more
moments,
i
think
i
can
answer
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice
on
the
record.
in
the
first
place
in
the
supplemental
brief,
a
question
was
just
asked
a
few
moments
ago
for
the
second
time.
in
the
supplemental
brief
of
the
state
of
louisiana
on
page
9,
a
short
paragraph
of
the
second
full
paragraph
on
that
page.
prior
to
october
1962,
expenditures
from
the
fund
for
vice
investigations
by
appellant's
office

been
approved
by

judges.
they
had
been
approved.

of
the
record,
one
of
the
judges
has
questioned
on
the
subject
with
regard
to
prior
administrations
of
district
attorneys.
let
me
ask
you,
this
judge,
“if
you
don't
feel
the
district
attorney
has
the
discretion,
can
you
point
to
any
single
case
in
the
previous
district
attorney's
administration
that
you
refuse
to
authorize,
meaning
as
you'll
find
in
the
context,
these
orders
were
investigation
funds?”
and
the
answer
is
“no,
i
don't
remember
any.”
so
that
they
were
always
approved
up
to
this
time
as
appellant
said
when
the
beer
drinking
joints
have
began
to
get
closed
or
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
about
five
months
i
think,
yes.
he
was
--
took
office
in
may
and
this
happened
in
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
--
statement
was
made
in
november
of
the
record.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
think
the
attorney
general
made
that
statement.
there
isn't
any
question
and
after
all,
it's
almost
a
matter
of
public
record
of
which
i
believe
you
could
take
judicial
notice
if
it's
not
in
there.
in
so
many
words,
he
ran
independently.
he
had
no
political
party.
there
isn't
any
statement
there
that
he
said
the
judges
were
an
association
of
armed
robbers.
he
says,
“i
have
no
organization.
my
opponents
are
the
association
of
armed
robbers.”
he
wasn't
talking
about
the
judges.
that's
--
a
string
that
that
language
won't
take
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
pardon?
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
the
political
organizations
which
had
opposed
him
in
his
elect.
i
have
no
organization.
i
have
no
--
he
says
that.
that's
expressed
on
opponent,
i
think.
my
opponents
are
the
association
of
armed
robbers,
meaning
the
professional
political
organizations
which
had
opposed
him
in
his
election.
he
was
elected
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
pardon?
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
what
maybe
the
opin
--?
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
i
think
--
well,
i
didn't
have
it
performed
but
here
the
sentence
before
that
says,
“i
have
no
organization
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
that's
--
and
that
follows
right
with
it.
“i
have
no
organization,
the
other
officials
are
the
association
of
armed
robbers.”
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
you
could
ask
and
he
would
answer
that
question
affirmatively.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
for,
well
--
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
he
took
office
in
may.
this
controversy
started
three
or
four
months
later,
i
think.
i
suppose
i
can
get
it.
the
statement
which
is
the
subject
of
this
--
once
the
subject
of
this
prosecution
was
made
on
november
2nd,
published
on
november
2nd
as
i
recall
it.
now,
there
had
been
a
building
up
of
the
controversy
and
statements
back
and
forth
when
the
retired
judge
made
his
statement
charging
appellant
with
responsibility
for
the
backlog
of
these
cases,
that
wasn't
the
first
thing
that
was
said
on
this
subject
that
had
been
going
back
and
forth.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
well,
i
think
the
judgment
must
go
with
me
in
either
event
but
i
do
think
it
makes
that
difference
because
it
brings
it
under
the
scope
of
what
we
have
called
sedition
in
the
last
175
or
100
maybe
year.
mr.
eberhard
p.
deutsch
would
--
would
make
it
sedition
in
the
--
shall
i
say
appropriate
sense.
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
an
offense
for
him
to
make
the
statement
as
to
what
he
thought
this
court
would
ultimately
do
in
this
case.
i
certainly
had
my
very
strong
views
and
i
ask
you
to
support
it.
