(inaudible)
justice

where
is
that?
justice
byron

white
is
there
(inaudible)
justice

in
another
case?
justice

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

and
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
came
up
here
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
(inaudible)
justice

white
(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)

and
(inaudible)
licensee
attempts
to
hold
an
infringer
and
thinking
someone
is
infringing
because
he
is
making
use
of
these
parts
that
are
patent
--
patent
this
combination
--
justice
byron
r.
white
making
nuts
and
bolts.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
the
argument
is
whether
there's
fair
weight
if
they
get
them
all
and
it
is
not
an
infringement
to
make
the
nuts
and
bolts
(inaudible)
they
automatically
violates
the
(inaudible)
justice
byron

(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)
actually
have
to
get

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
the
court
have
passed
a
--
wouldn't
the
court
adhere
the
first
case
and,
after
you
have
reached
your
separate
defense,
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
infringement
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
think
there's
a
perfectly
obvious
explanation
(inaudible)
because
we
don't
have
to
agree
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
you
have
here
involves
the
use
only
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
the
owner
of
the
sports
car
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
he
is
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then,
they
(inaudible)
that
he
replaced.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
the
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
that
we've
ever
reached
the
precise
point
as
to
furnishing
an
unpatented
element
of
a
combination
patent.i
remember
brandeis'
opinion,
but
that
wasn't
a
combination
patent,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean
it
wasn't
before
the
court?
the
lower
court
--
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
certainly
presented
in
the
district
court
at
this
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
why
won't
you
present
it
in
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
in
light
that
the
judgment
was
affirmed.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
right
was
before
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
district
court's
view
at
this
time
(inaudible)
that,
last
time,
they
didn't
consider
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
they
did
consider
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
did
consider
it
at
that
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
slightly
handled
the
aro,
parts
that
he
misused,
but
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
argued
in
brief
just
the
use
of
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
issue
of
the
argument
(inaudible)
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
the
court
said
what's
in
issue?
i
don't
see
how
(inaudible)
was
not
an
issue
as
(inaudible)
so
that
it
would
have
to
consider
(inaudible)
separate
defense
as
the
court's
side
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
only
way
to
make
it
(inaudible)
whether
it
was
mostly
entirely
the
case
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
ford
can
avoid
the
separate
defense.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
the
court
today,
if
at
all,
agreed
to
argue
that
it's
invalid
in
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
(inaudible)
ford
to
raise,
to
move
certiorari
before
the
first
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
whether
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
pollock,
did
you
at
any
time
