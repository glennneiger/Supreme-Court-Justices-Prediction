mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
this
case
was
argued
here
three
years
ago,
the
petitioner
at
that
time
was
represented
by
mr.
wolf
and,
also,
the
views
of
the
government
were
expressed
by
mr.
spritzer,
appearing
for
the
solicitor
general's
office.
at
that
time,
mr.
wolf
advanced
the
very
arguments
which
were
advanced
during
mr.
hieken's
main
argument
today.
mr.
spritzer,
however,
appearing
for
the
solicitor
general's
office,
declined
to
join
mr.
wolf
in
finding
or
in
urging
any
antitrust
violation
or
any
misuse
of
the
patent.
and,
he
urged
at
that
time
that
the
essential
issue
in
this
case
was
one
of
direct
infringement.
subsequently,
three
years
ago,
this
court
rendered
its
decision
in
this
case.
and,
at
that
time,
the
majority
opinion,
as
well
as
the
minority
or
dissenting
opinion
and
the
other
opinions,
all
made
it
very
clear
that
the
real
important
issue
here,
the
vital
issue,
was
one
of
direct
infringement.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
justice
black's
concurring
opinion
in
the
case
termed
that
issue
of
direct
infringement
the
crucial
issue
and
went
on
to
say
that,
since
that
was
the
crucial
question,
if
you
will,
he
felt
that
these
other
comments
about
misuse
and
the
like
were
confusing
and
beside
the
point.
today,
three
years
later,
we
are
still
concerned
with
this
vital
question
of
direct
infringement,
except
that,
today,
we
are
concerned
with
a
different
aspect
of
it
than
was
primarily
here
before
the
court
three
years
ago.
three
years
ago,
the
questions
of
ford
and
general
motors
cars
and
the
distinctions
between
them
were
presented.
however,
no
one
seriously
contended
at
that
time
that
there
was
any
error
with
respect
to
ford
cars.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
during
colloquy
with
mr.
spritzer,
i
recall
that
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
that,
in
his
understanding,
mr.
spritzer
was
advancing
arguments
only
with
respect
to
general
motors
cars
and
that
they
did
not
apply
to
ford
cars.
and,
mr.
spritzer
conceded
that
that
was
the
case
and
of
course,
in
mr.
brennan's
concurring
opinion,
we
find
an
expressed
distinction
made
between
ford
cars
in
the
other
subject
matter.
now,
what
is
this
distinction?
the
first
aspect
that
we're
talking
about,
the
general
motors
cars
that
were
primarily
here
three
years
ago
are
so-called
“license
structures.”
and,
at
that
time
three
years
ago,
the
primary
question
before
the
court
related
to
a
licensed
user's
liability
when
he
repaired
a
structure
--
a
patented
structure
which
he
had
acquired
from
some
sanctioned
source,
such
as
the
patentee
or
his
licensee.
today,
we
are
concerned
with
a
different
aspect,
the
ford
aspect,
concerning
in
unlicensed
user's
liability
when
he
repairs
a
structure
covered
by
patent
which
was
acquired
from
an
infringing
source.
and,
it
is
our
view
that
these
differences,
this
licensed-unlicensed
distinction
is
so
vital
a
distinction,
so
fundamental
a
distinction
as
to
involve
entirely
different
rationales,
entirely
different
questions
of
public
policy,
entirely
different
lines
of
precedent
and
as
to
require
entirely
different
results.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that
is
correct.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that
is
correct.
it
is
our
view
--
the
crux
of
our
view,
in
effect,
that
even
though
what
was
discussed
three
years
ago
was
found
to
be
no
more
than
repair,
insofar
as
license
structures
were
concerned,
this
is
no
defense
as
to
unlicensed
structure,
in
that,
a
repair
of
an
unlicensed
structure
is
itself
an
act
of
direct
infringement
since
it
perpetuates
the
infringement
and
prolongs
its
life.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes.
now,
i
believe
we
should
go
further
than
that,
mr.
justice
white,
simply
because
there
are
ways
of
aiding
and
abetting
a
repair
which
would
not
be
liable
under
this.
insofar
as
discussion
has
been
made
regarding
replacement
of
an
unpatented
part,
the
question
actually
before
the
court
in
this
direct
infringement
aspect
is
broader
than
that
because
repairs
can
be
affected
to
an
unlicensed
structure
without
replacing
any
parts,
so
that
we're
not
concerned
with
the
replacement
of
a
part
as
the
essential
question.
if
we
have
a
combination
of
structure
in
which
some
part
becomes
broken,
theoretically,
we
can
make
a
repair
by
welding
that
part
or
by
soldering
it.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
because,
in
that
case,
he
would
be
selling
a
staple
article
of
commerce
suitable
for
substantial
non-infringing
use.
and,
this
is
one
of
the
expressed
outs,
if
you
will,
in
section
271
(c).
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
they
can
reuse
--
the
record
is
very
clear
on
that
point
that
the
item
which
the
petitioners
were
making
could
be
used
only
on
these
ford
cars
had
no
other
use
at
all.
it
could
not
fit
any
other
cars
and
had
no
other
anticipated
usage.
now,
insofar
as
we
are
talking
about
repairs
to
an
unlicensed
structure,
it
is
the
act
of
repair
which
is
the
act
of
direct
infringement,
and
that
act
of
repair
may
be
affected
without
replacing
any
parts.
it
could,
of
course,
involve
the
replacement
of
parts.
if
the
parts
being
replaced
are
standard
articles
of
commerce
such
as
nuts
and
bolts
which
you
purchase
at
the
corner
hardware
store,
that
hardware
store
is
not
a
contributory
infringer
simply
because
he
sells
nuts
and
bolts
because
congress
has
given
him
a
specific
out.
if,
however,
the
part
being
replaced
is
the
part
such
as
aro
was
manufacturing,
namely
a
part
which
they
knowingly
made
for
use
in
this
combination
and
which
they
know
--
which
they
knew
had
no
other
use
whatsoever,
then
they
are
contributory
infringers.
it
must
be
recalled
that,
insofar
as
we
are
concerned
or
argue
was
made
regarding
knowledge
and
the
like,
aro
well
knew
what
it
was
doing.
the
record
is
very
clear
on
that
point.
and,
this
court,
in
its
majority
opinion
last
time
expressly
stated,
and
i'm
quoting
now
from
page
341
of
this
court's
opinion,
“it
is
admitted
that
petitioners
know
that
the
purchasers
intend
to
use
the
fabric
for
replacement
purposes
on
automobile
convertible
tops
which
are
covered
by
the
claims
of
respondent's
combination
patent.
and,
such
manufacture
and
sale
with
knowledge
--
with
that
knowledge
might
well
constitute
contributory
infringement
under
section
271
(c)
if,
but
only
if,
such
a
replacement
by
the
purchaser
himself
would
in
itself
constitute
a
direct
infringement
under
section
271
(a).
so,
we
come
down
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
replacement
of
a
part
by
this
ford
car
owner,
if
you
will,
is
an
act
of
direct
infringement
and
we
contend
it
is.
now,
i
think
it
would
be
important
for
us
to
analyze
very
briefly
the
differences
between
the
ford
and
general
motors
situations.
we
have,
as
mr.
hieken
asked
for
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that
is
correct.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that
is
also
correct.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
or
from
any
other
source.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes.
it
is
continued
use
of
this
infringing
article
which
he
has.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
no,
it
is
just
a
--
it's
a
prolongation
of
the
infringement,
if
you
will.
it
is
a
continuation
of
it.
in
the
words
of
mr.
justice
taft
in
one
of
the
decisions
we
have
cited,
it
is
a
perpetuation
of
the
infringement.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes,
it
does,
because
presumably
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
no,
presumably,
but
for
the
repair,
the
infringement
would've
ceased
at
that
point.presumably,
but
for
the
repair,
this
thing
would've
gone
on
the
scrap
heap.
and
so,
insofar
as
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
well,
i'm
afraid
i
am
not
quite
certain
on
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
we're
assuming
--
i
understand,
that
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
no,
i
--
excuse
me,
sir.
we
are
--
we
are
assuming
that
some
act
of
repair
was
made
at
this
time
intentionally.
i
--
i
would
agree
with
you
entirely,
mr.
justice
black,
but
if
he
had
done
nothing
and
had
merely
continued
using
this
car
with
its
dirty
top,
if
you
will,
that
is
merely
a
continuation
of
the
original
direct
infringement.
it
is
a
continuation
of
the
infringing
use
which,
itself,
is
direct
infringement.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
if
i
may
look
at
it,
sir.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes.and
he
previously
said
that,
in
permissible
repair,
that
you
can't
get
anything?
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
i
read
that
particular
statement,
mr.
justice
black,
in
the
context
in
which
it
was
given
and
i
would
invite
this
court's
attention,
for
example,
to
the
fact
that
immediately
before
the
statement
here,
mr.
justice
whittaker
set
forth
what
i
can
consider
to
be
the
rationale
for
his
statement.
and,
it
says
in
here
mr.
justice
whittaker
cited
leeds
and
catlin,
hired
--
and
also
wilson
versus
simpson
and
he
said
“it
is
significant
that
each
of
the
three
cases
of
this
court
cited
for
that
proposition
holds
that
a
license
to
use
a
patented
combination
includes
the
right
to
preserve
its
fitness
for
use
so
far
as
it
maybe
affected
by
wear
or
breakage.”
so
that,
he
was
saying
that,
insofar
as
we
are
concerned
with
replacing
a
part
which
is
worn
out
or
broken,
that
replacement
of
such
a
worn
out
or
broken
part
is
implied
from
the
license
to
use
which
the
owner
had.
now,
there
was
no
such
license
to
use
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
in
order
to
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that
is
correct.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
it
says
“no
element,
not
itself
separately
patented,
that
constitutes
one
of
the
elements
of
a
combination
patent
is
entitled
to
patent
monopoly,
however
essential
it
maybe
to
the
patent
combination
and
no
matter
how
costly
or
difficult
replacement
may
be.”
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
i
agree
with
that
statement,
except
that
we
must
understand
that
we
are
not
here
trying
to
monopolize
an
element.
we
are
here
monopolizing,
if
you
will,
the
entire
combination.
there
is
no
question
but
that
ford
sold
a
complete
combination
of
structure
which
was
covered
by
the
patent.
there
was
no
license.
it
was
an
infringement.
and,
when
the
purchaser
bought
that
car
and
used
it,
he
was
using
a
complete
combination.
now,
certainly,
had
he
repaired
the
structure
by
welding
a
part,
we
would
not
be
concerned
with
the
replacement
of
an
unpatented
part.
we'd
merely
be
concerned
with
whether
or
not
that
act
of
welding
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
no.
no,
i
consider
it
more
of
this
act
of
repair.
in
--
in
the
case
of
an
unlicensed
structure,
any
act
of
repair
is
a
continuation
of
this
prolonged
--
prolongation
of
this
infringing
use
and,
therefore,
in
itself,
more
direct
infringement.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
the
welding
would,
itself,
be
an
act
of
direct
infringement.
now,
this
is
--
incidentally,
supported
by
decisions
of
this
court,
and
i
am
primarily
--
i
primarily
invite
the
court's
attention
in
the
case
of
wilson
versus
union
tool
in
which
mr.
justice
brandeis
spoke
for
a
unanimous
court
on
the
question
and
pointed
out
that,
in
his
view
and
in
the
court's
view
at
that
time,
the
sale
of
repair
parts,
if
you
will,
was
an
act
of
direct
infringement
since
the
installation
of
repair
parts
was
an
act
of
direct
infringement
in
as
much
as
the
patentee
had
not
been
compensated.
there
is
precedent
for
this
--
for
what
i
am
saying.
moreover,
there
is
precedent
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes,
i
believe
it
was,
your
honor.
i
have
the
opinion
here.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
no.
we
--
we
consider,
mr.
justice
douglas
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
i
that
concede,
yes.
but,
in
our
view,
what
we
are
contending
here
is
that
what
we
are
doing
is
precisely
what
congress
sanctioned
in
the
271
(c).
there,
they
were
concern
with
the
replacement
or
the
sale
of
a
part
of
a
combination.
mr.
federico,
in
his
commentary
on
that
particular
statutory
section,
pointed
out
that
the
part
we
were
concerned
with
is
obviously
a
so-called
unpatented
part
to
the
extent
that
there
is
no
claim
covering
it
directly
since,
if
there
were
a
claim
covering
it
directly,
there
would
be
no
need
at
all
for
section
271
(c).
so,
congress
has
sanctioned,
if
you
will,
a
cause
of
action
based
upon
sale
of
parts
or
actions
regarding
certain
parts
of
a
combination
where
only
the
combination
has
been
claimed.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
not
at
all,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
is
a
very
rare
circumstance.
it's
a
rear
circumstance
where
we
have
a
person,
such
as
petitioner,
who
is
manufacturing
a
part
of
a
combination
which
has
no
other
earthly
use
but
in
this
combination.
that's
the
very
rear
case.
ordinarily,
the
combination
could
be
--
every
part
of
it
could
be
manufactured.
it
would
--
you'll
find
a
wide
diversity
of
uses
for
every
part
of
the
combination.
we
have
a
situation
here
though
which
is
quite
different
and
in
which
the
facts
actually
fall
directly
within
section
271
(c).
congress
has
laid
forth
a
series
of
factual
test
which
may,
in
certain
circumstances,
be
sufficient
to
hold
a
person
a
contributory
infringer,
provided
he
sells
a
part
of
a
combination
which
meets
certain
factual
test.
and,
it
will
be
recalled
that
when
this
court
earlier
decided
the
case,
we
--
the
court
itself
expressly
said
that,
but
for
this
question
of
direct
infringement,
petitioner's
part
did
meet
every
one
of
these
tests.
and,
again
i
refer
to
page
341
of
the
decision
which
i
quoted
earlier
wherein
this
court
said
that
it
is
admitted
that
the
petitioners
know
and
do
certain
things,
and
sale,
with
that
knowledge,
might
well
constitute
contributory
under
--
infringement,
under
271
(c)
if
the
replacement
by
the
purchaser
is
an
act
of
direct
infringement.
now,
in
the
majority
opinion
--
in
this
court's
majority
opinion,
it
set
forth
what
we
conceive
to
be
the
rationale
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that
is
correct.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that's
correct.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that's
correct.
i
believe
that,
historically,
the
situation
was
this.
when
this
case
was
first
filed,
your
honor,
we
urged
that
the
defendant
was
a
direct
and
contributory
infringer
as
to
both
ford
and
general
motors
cars.
in
the
case
of
ford
cars,
there
was
no
question
at
anytime
throughout
this
litigation
that
there
had
been
no
license
and,
therefore,
we
said
that,
under
established
principles
of
law
--
patent
law,
even
if
they
did
no
more
than
repair
that
infringing
ford
car,
they
were
direct
infringers.
however,
we
recognized
that
general
motors
cars
were
licensed
and,
therefore,
it
was
our
position
as
to
them
that
this
act
which
they
--
which
petitioners
were
effecting
was
actually
more
than
a
mere
repair.
it
was
actually
a
reconstruction.
under
the
law,
a
license
to
use
a
patented
combination
includes
an
implied
license
to
make
repairs
provided
the
repairs
don't
encroach
upon
this
field
of
reconstruction,
and
we
had
urged
that
what
the
defendants
were
actually
doing
was
reconstruction.
the
district
court
agreed
that
this
was
an
act
of
reconstruction
and,
therefore,
held
it
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
reconstruction
of
the
complete
combination.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes.
yes,
that
is
what
we
are
contending.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that
is
what
we
were
contending
at
that
time.
when
we
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
.when
we
came
to
this
court,
this
court,
considering
this
question
of
reconstruction,
stated
that
no
one
part
could
be
subject
--
could
constitute
--
or
the
replacements
of
no
one
part
could
constitute
a
reconstruction
of
a
combination.
and,
that
no
matter
how
vital
that
part
was,
no
matter
how
important,
how
costly,
how
durable,
and
these
were
all
tests
which
we
had
advanced,
nevertheless,
the
replacement
of
such
a
part
must
be
treated
as
no
more
than
repair,
not
reconstruction.
it
is
our
view
how
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
excuse
me.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
no.
i
am
saying
that
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that's
not
my
understanding
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
my
understanding
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
that,
to
be
consistent,
we
must
this
court's
earlier
opinion
three
years
ago
as
confining
itself
to
general
motors
cars
since
they
were
speaking
at
the
various
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
the
court
--
the
court
confined
itself
to
licensed
structures.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
it's
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
not
about
the
ford
cars,
your
honor.
as
i
recall,
ford
cars
were
mentioned.
there
was
a
general
agreement
that,
actually,
we
weren't
really
concern
about
ford
cars.
they
were
unlicensed.
mr.
spritzer
and
the
others
who
argued
confined
themselves
to
how
far
this
license
to
repair
went,
how
far
it
could
be
implied
from
the
original
license
to
use.
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
those
are
general
motors
cars
situations.
now,
as
i
understand
the
court
of
appeals
decision
below,
what
it
said
was
that
the
district
court,
ha
--
in
the
first
instance,
had
found
two
aspects
of
infringement,
namely
the
aspect
relating
to
licensed
general
motors
cars
and
the
aspect
relating
to
unlicensed
ford
cars.
it
said
that
when
petitioners,
aro,
appealed
the
decision
the
first
time,
they
didn't
make
much
to
do,
if
it
all,
about
this
ford
situation.
that
the
only
question
that
they
really
argued
before
them
at
this
time,
and
this
is
not
me
saying
this,
this
is
the
court
of
appeals
in
their
decision
saying
it,
they
said
the
only
question
which
they
really
argued
at
that
time
before
them
was
this
question
of
the
licensed
general
motors
cars
and
whether
it
was
repair
or
reconstruction.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes,
but
the
question
of
repair
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
no.
no,
it
is
our
view
--
obviously,
let
us
consider
the
general
motors
car
owner.
if
he
were
driving
the
car
down
the
street
with
his
license,
no
one
would
contend
that
he
was
an
infringer.
the
ford
car
owner,
however,
merely
driving
his
car
down
the
street
becomes
an
infringer.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that's
true.
and,
he
still
has
a
combination
of
structure.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes,
but
the
question
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
the
question
of
repair
versus
reconstruction,
however,
arises
only
when
we
have
an
originally
licensed
structure
because
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that's
right.
we
conceded,
for
purposes
of
this
dis
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes,
as
to
the
car
owner,
no
matter
what
he
does
by
way
of
repair,
the
ford
car
owner,
this
indirect
infringer,
as
to
what
he
did
with
respect
to
his
ford
car,
he
is
still
a
direct
infringer.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
it
was
my
interpretation
of
the
fact
that
you
had
concurred
in
the
result
that,
actually,
the
court
had
reached
the
decision
by
implication
and
that,
by
confining
its
decision
to
licensed
structures
by
speaking
throughout
of
the
implied
license
which
arises
from
a
direct
license
to
use,
that
they
were
actually
speaking
of
only
general
motors
cars
and
that
they
were,
in
effect,
to
the
extent
the
ford
situation
was
before
them,
were
merely
saying
that
they're
--
that
this
rule
that
they
are
setting
forth
does
not
extend
to
unlicensed
structures.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
no,
i
don't.
i
don't
think
it
was
even
before
the
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
court.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
on
the
question
which
had
been
presented
to
them.
and,
as
the
court
of
appeals
argue
this
time
or
as
the
court
of
appeals
set
forth
this
time
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes,
it
was.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
i'm
afraid
you'll
have
to
ask
petitioners
that
they
took
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
they
took
--
no.
yes,
they
took
an
appeal
and
the
only
question
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
i
assume
it
was,
except
to
the
extent
that
the
first
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
well,
i
say
that,
if
i
may,
because
the
first
circuit
rule
say
that
they
will
consider
only
those
questions
which
are
presented
to
them.
and,
therefore,
insofar
as
they
affirm,
they
affirm
with
regard
to
those
questions
which
petitioner
presented
to
them.
and,
i
say
that
they
did
not
question
their
liability
as
to
ford
cars
when
they
first
went
up
on
an
appeal.
now,
i'm
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
they
said
that
it
was
not
--
that
was
not
seriously
questioned
the
last
time.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
pardon
me?
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes,
i
suppose
they
did.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
it
was
the
entire
question
before
them.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
it
reversed
and
it
was
remanded
for
a
judgment
not
inconsistent
with
the
court's
mandate.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
no,
but
i
would
not
consider
that
the
ford
decision
was
inconsistent
with
this
court's
mandate.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
since
ford
cars
were
unlicensed,
i
would
consider
it
entirely
consistent.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
sir?
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
i'm
afraid
i
can't
answer
the
question.
i
have
--
i
see
that
the
word
“reverse”
was
at
the
end
of
your
decision,
sir.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
it
meant
that
you
--
it
meant
that
the
question
that
was
presented
to
you
was
reversed.
i
might
note,
in
that
regard,
with
no
attempted
levity
that
when
mr.
spritzer
appeared
here,
he
said
that
the
only
question
of
public
interest
related
to
licensed
structures.
now,
if
that
has
any
bearing
on
the
scope
of
this
court's
reversal,
the
only
question
which
the
government
then
thought
was
important
was
a
licensed
structure.
they
said
they
took
no
view
with
respect
to
unlicensed
structure.
the
only
thing
that
they
urge
was
that
this
court
review
--
reverse
insofar
as
the
court
below
had
found
that
the
replacement
of
parts
were
reconstruction
of
a
licensed
structure.
they
said
that,
insofar
as
a
man
has
sold
a
structure,
a
patentee,
he
should
be
limited
to
that
original
sale,
but
they
took
no
view
with
regard
to
what
h
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that
is
true.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that
is
true.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
they
argued
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
pardon
me?
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes,
at
length.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that
is
true.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
the
--
the
question
actually,
as
i
saw
it
at
that
time,
was
whether
or
not
the
court
was
talking
about
both
general
motors
and
ford
cars.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
was
the
basis
for
our
motion
for
clarification
since
neither
car
had
been
mentioned
at
that
time.
and,
the
only
way
that
i
can
personally
interpret
this
court's
first
opinion
was
that
it
was
confined
to
general
motors
cars
since
the
decision
throughout
spoke
of
licensed
structures,
and
this
implied
license
to
repair
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
because
misuse
had
been
dropped
as
an
issue
on
appeal
below.
it
was
never
appealed.
in
other
words
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that
is
true.
they
said
it
was
not
an
issue
since
it
had
never
been
appealed,
in
effect,
the
--
and,
insofar
as
it
was
a
defense,
the
appellant
below
had
abandoned
that
defense.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
as
to
whether
they
had
abandoned
it?
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
i
don't
recall
exactly.
it
was
briefed
extensively.
i
don't
know
that
there
was
a
question
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
17,
your
honor?
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes,
and
also,
starting
at
the
bottom
of
page
19,
extending
across
page
20,
i
invite
your
attention
to
the
cited
quotations,
for
example,
about
a-third
of
the
way
down
in
which
we
have
italicized
certain
portions.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that's
true.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
it
definitely
would,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
no.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
no.
i
hope
further
than
that
and,
perhaps,
i
better
make
my
point
right
now
in
view
of
the
like.
my
point
is
this,
that
both
the
direct
--
both
the
majority
opinion
and
the
dissenting
opinion
made
a
clear
point
that
we
were
concerned
with
two
statutory
sections
here,
271
(a)
and
271
(c).
they
said,
as
to
271
(a),
which
is
a
definition
of
direct
infringement,
it
is
very
clear
to
the
court,
and
to
every
opinion
that
was
rendered
here,
it
was
very
clear
that
271
(a)
was
intended
to
be
declaratory
of
direct
infringement
law
as
it
stood
at
that
time
and
was
intended
to
live
intact
the
law
of
direct
infringement.
now,
what
i
have
been
arguing
regarding
replairs
--
repairs
of
infringing
structures
represents
direct
infringement
law
which
was
around
prior
to
enactment
of
section
271
(a).
we
have
in
our
brief,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
cited
decisions
not
only
from
this
court
but
from
every
one
of
the
tenth
circuits,
from
the
first
through
the
tenth
circuit,
on
that
point
and
we
have
been
able
to
find
no
opinion
which
holds
to
the
contrary.
so,
we
are
saying
that
one
of
the
principles
of
direct
infringement
law
which
was
established
at
the
time
that
congress
codified
it
and
left
it
intact
was
this
question
of
repairs
to
unlicensed
structures.
and,
therefore,
insofar
as
congress
had
actually
left
the
law
intact,
as
the
legislative
history
shows
and
as
this
court
conceded,
they
were
leaving
this
principle
intact
as
well.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes,
are
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
we
presented
the
matter
on
this
point,
that
the
case
was
going
back
and
we
were
not
sure
whether
it
was
intended
to
extend
to
ford
and
general
motors
or
merely
to
general
motors.
would
the
court
clarify
it?
and,
that
was
denied.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
no.
i
make
one
further
point,
if
i
may,
and
that
is
that,
with
respect
to
section
271
(c),
what
aro
was
actually
arguing
here
and
seeking
is
an
immunity
for
replacement
parts
manufacturers
which
they
were
denied
by
congress.
it
will
be
recalled
that,
in
this
court's
first
aro
decision,
the
court
held
that
the
sale
of
a
part,
no
matter
of
what
nature
for
use
in
an
originally
licensed
combination,
was
not
an
act
for
which
a
replacement
part
manufacturer
could
be
held
liable
under
271
(c).
if
the
court
now
accepts
aro's
present
argument
and
holds
that
the
same
rule
applies
even
as
to
unlicensed
structures,
the
two
aro
decisions
taken
together
will,
in
effect,
say
that
a
replacement
part
manufacturer
can
never
be
liable
for
the
sale
of
any
part
for
installation
on
any
combination
which
is
either
licensed
or
unlicensed.
in
my
view,
this
completely
sweeps
the
ambit.
it
completely
--
it
gives
a
replacement
part
manufacturer
a
complete
immunity.
now,
this
court
has
noted
that
during
the
legislative
hearings
preceding
this
enactment,
271
(c),
replacement
part
manufacturers
were
very
well-represented.
they
were
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
words
of
the
legislative
history,
the
most
vociferous
objectors
and,
nevertheless,
congress
has
said
that
replacement
part
manufacturers
should
be
liable
in
a
proper
case.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
in
a
proper
case.
now,
we
submit
and
it
is
our
view
that,
insofar
--
that
if
they
are
not
liable
in
the
case
of
an
originally
licensed
structure
or
in
the
case
of
an
originally
unlicensed
structure,
there
can
never
be
a
proper
case,
if
you
will.
there
would
be
no
circumstance
under
which
they
could
be
held
liable
and
they
would,
in
effect,
have
immunity
to
liability
under
the
statute
which
congress
refuse
to
give
them.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
it
protected
the
actual
terms
of
the
lease
where
that
ford
was
protected
and
any
car
owners
who
had
not
at
that
time
replaced
because
the
release
did
not
extend
to
cars
where
there
had
been
replacement
fabrics
put
on
them.
moreover,
the
history
shows
that
this
question
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes
--
no,
it
was
--
well,
we
are
bound
by
it.
it
was
made
before
we
came
in.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that
is
true.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that
is
true.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that
is
true.
we
had
tried
--
or
i
understand
from
the
record
in
this
case,
which
is
also
very
clear,
there
had
been
efforts
made
in
order
to
try
disposing
of
the
entire
thing.
the
ford
motor
company
was
very
clear
that
they
were
not
going
to
pay
one
cent
by
way
of
compensation
for
acts
of
a
person
such
as
aro.
they
refused
to
do
it
and
that
they
gave
us
the
reservation
instead.
they
said
if
you
want
to
get
that
kind
of
money,
go
against
them
and
that's
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that
is
one
way
that
this
distinction
could
arise,
yes.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
the
man
who
is
using
the
car
without
license
is
a
direct
infringer.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes,
he
is.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
no.
he
is
just
continuing
the
same
infringement.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that
is
true.
but,
if
he
had
gone
to
a
hardware
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
if
he
had
done
nothing,
he
would
be
an
infringer.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that
is
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that's
true
and
actually,
we
are
trying
to
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
it
--
it
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
as
to
this
question
of
repair
of
unlicensed
structures,
the
question
of
the
top
is
--

the

mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
the
question
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
the
question
of
the
top
is
germane
insofar
as
we
are
to
determine
whether
aro
is
a
contributory
infringer.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
absolutely
not,
i
mean
they
would
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
is
very
special.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
yes,
we're
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
we're
concerned
with
what
the
owner
himself
is
doing.
we're
concerned
with
this
owner's
liability.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
they
have
not
raised
that.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
no.
the
validity
of
the
patent
has
been
conceded
throughout.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
no.
there
--
if
i
may,
the
point
that
they're
making
on
the
question
of
validity
was
that,
in
their
view,
there
is
no
infringement
and,
therefore,
a
d
--
an
expressed
finding
of
validity
is
merely
advisory
in
nature
and
should
not
be
found.
they
had
never
argued
that
the
patent
is
invalid,
never.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
they
had
never
argued
that
the
patent
is
invalid.
they
had
merely
stated
that,
in
their
view,
there
should
not
be
any
expressed
holding
of
validity
as
long
as
there
is
no
infringement.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
that
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
they
are
speaking
there
of
whether
or
not
it
was
within
the
power
of
congress
to
protect
a
part
of
a
combination.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
no.
they
do
not
say
that.
as
i
read
it
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
they're
saying
whether
or
not
it
was
within
the
power
of
congress
to
protect
a
part
which
itself
was
not,
if
you
will,
claimed.
if
w
--
if
a
part
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
or
could
not
be
and
this
maybe
arise
not
so
much
because
of
the
lack
of
invention
but
because
of
the
question
of
semantics.
in
this
case,
for
example,
the
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
well,
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
justice
black,
it
was
impossible
to
claim
the
top
per
se
simply
because
the
top
must
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
must
be
claimed
an
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
we
--
no
--
no,
your
honor.
we
have
never
gotten
an
injunction
from
them.
we've
got
nothing
but
heartache,
if
you
will.
thank
you.
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
i
frankly
do
not
recall,
except
that
i
think
that
we
may
have
argued
at
that
time
that
the
question
was
abandoned
for
failure
to
appeal
and
that,
therefore,
it
was
not
a
question
which
was
--
mr.
elliott
i.
pollock
i
--
i
frankly
don't
remember
what
was
in
the
brief
at
the
time.
i
--
i
will
rely
on
whatever
i
said
at
that
time.
