justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
--
you
say
that
the
top
would
have
been
discarded
and
put
in
the
garbage
can
or
something?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
assuming?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
do
you
do
with
last
sentence
of
justice
whittaker's
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
it
says
is
“measured
by
this
test
of
replacement
of
the
fabrics
involved
in
this
case
must
be
characterized
as
permissible
repair,
not
reconstruction.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
element,
not
separately
patented.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
that
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
he
mean
by
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
if
he
cut
out
of
patch,
a
piece
of
bolt,
then
that's
different
than
welding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
that
every
time
a
man
gets
a
combination
patent,
that
every
part
of
it,
for
that
--
although
you
couldn't
possibly
get
patent,
that
every
part
of
it
is
an
infringement
for
somebody
else
to
sell
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
really
your
question,
isn't
it?
was
that
we
decided
before
whether
it
was
a
direct
infringement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
make
a
--
cut
out
a
part
of
the
top
and
call
it
a
fit
top.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
man
who'd
bought
the
top
pays
for
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
really
the
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
that
it
was
making
a
distinction
between
those
two?
justice
hugo
l.
black
between
this
argument
that's
made
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
they
are
reconstruction,
but
i
can't,
for
the
life
of
me,
see
whether
it
makes
any
difference
whether
they
were
licensed
or
unlicensed.
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
court's
opinion
that
justifies
this.
the
question
is
whether
that
is
a
reconstruction
or
making
of
a
top.
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
a
making
of
the
top.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
--
i
understood,
not
in
his
driving
down
the
street
but
the
fact
that
he
replaced
a
worn
out
part
of
it
with
a
new
part.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and,
the
issue
there
is,
isn't
it,
whether
that
is
to
be
put
in
the
classification
of
reconstruction
of
the
top
so
it
would
be
infringement,
direct
or
indirect,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
or
whether
it's
just
a
repair?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
is
permitted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
you
draw
a
distinction
between
a
man
that
had
sold
an
automobile
with
your
top
on
it.
if
he
sells
it,
whether
he
sells
it
to
somebody
who's
been
licensed
to
make
or
use
a
car
or
whether
he
doesn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
you
say
is
that
this
man,
suppose
they
were
guilty
of
direct
infringement
if
they
put
in
a
repair
on
it
of
any
kind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
so
that,
suppose
he
loses
a
nut,
just
one
nut,
and
he
goes
and
puts
that
nut
back
on
there.
he
finds
one
somewhere
in
his
garbage
can
or
somewhere
and
he
puts
it
on.would
he
be
an
infringer
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
--
that
makes
him
a
new
infringer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
just
continuing
an
old
infringement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
drives
a
nail
in
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
you
are
--
what
you
could
do
in
this
is
to
say
that
it
has
--
it's
wholly
immaterial
to
this
case
whether
he
did
this
to
his
top
or
something
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
was
an
infringer
and
you
ought
to
hold
him
liable
as
an
original
infringer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and,
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
in
reality.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
--
it's
all
beside
the
point,
all
he
this
talk
about
the
top,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
matter
how
big
it
is
or
how
small
or
how
insignificant.
he
bought
it.
he
may
know
or
not
know
that
it
was
not
licensed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
can't
do
a
thing
in
the
world
to
make
his
top
a
little
more
usable
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
unless
you're
suing
him
for
infringement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
--
why
--
would
he
be
liable
if
he
went
to
the
hardware
store
and
wrote
the
note
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
what
was
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you're
right
on
your
contention,
it
brings
back
to
us,
doesn't
it,
the
question
that
they've
raised
as
to
whether
what
you
had
was
an
invention
which
could
be
granted
to
patent
under
the
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes
they
have,
that'
on
one
of
the
grounds.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
that's
one
of
the
grounds
that's
argued
here
today.
it's
in
their
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
they
haven't
raised
that
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
this
mean?
whether
the
constructions
of
section
271
(c)
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
convert
the
said
monopoly
over
the
unpatented
replacement
fabric,
the
ford
motor
company
is
authorized
by
article
1,
section
8
of
the
constitution
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and,
the
fabric
element
itself
is
not
the
discovery
of
an
inventor.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
is
not
an
invention?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
say,
it's
not
the
discovery
of
an
invention.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
question
of
semantic.
they
hold
him
liable
for
getting
a
little
closed
top
wouldn't
make
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
treble
damages,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
trying
to
get
treble
damages
against
them,
i
take
it.
