mr.
charles
hieken
--
as
construed
by
the
court
below
to
confer
patent
monopoly
over
an
unpatented
element
that
is
not
the
discovery
of
an
inventor.
our
brief
also
discusses
whether
a
final
judgment,
dismissing
a
complaint
for
a
patent
infringement,
can
include
an
advisory
finding
not
relevant
to
deciding
the
case
or
controversy
between
the
parties
that
a
patent
is
valid.
we
leave
to
our
memorandum,
filed
last
august,
a
discussion
of
respondent's
motial
--
motion
to
settle
order
in
which
respondent
seeks
to
exclude
certain
material
related
to
respondent's
inequitable
conduct
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
misusing
combination
patents
to
restrain
trade
of
non-patented
goods.
we
turn,
first,
to
a
discussion
of
the
scope
of
the
combination
patent
monopoly.
the
combination
patent
here
in
suit
is
entitled
convertible
automobile
folding
top
with
automatic
seal
at
the
rear
quarter.
now,
the
combination
patent
in
suit
here
covers
a
combination
of
elements
which
function
together
to
affect
a
water-tight
seal
at
the
rear
quarter
of
the
automobile.
one
of
the
elements
in
the
patented
combination
is
the
unpatented
fabric
element.
there
is
no
separate
claim
to
the
fabric
and,
therefore,
the
fabric
element
is
itself
not
patented.
ford
and
general
motors
cars
for
the
years
in
the
early
1950s
embodied
the
patented
combination
as
original
equipment.
the
petitioners
make,
sell,
and
on
occasion
install
only
replacements
for
the
unpatented
fabric
element
of
the
patented
combination.
as
a
result
of
this
activity,
respondent
charged
petitioners
with
infringement
and
contributory
infringement.
the
district
court,
the
first
time
around,
found
both
infringement
and
contributory
infringement
arising
from
the
manufacture,
installation,
and
sale
of
these
unpatented
replacement
fabrics
for
both
ford
and
general
motors
cars,
and
accordingly
entered
an
interlocutory
judgment.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that
judgment.
this
court
then
granted
certiorari
and
reversed.
after
denying
respondent's
petition
for
rehearing
or
any
alternative,
a
motion
for
a
clarification
of
opinion
in
which
respondent
advanced
the
same
arguments
that
it
had
advanced
in
its
brief
on
the
merits
and
is
now
advancing
in
this
hearing
that
it
was
entitled
to
patent
monopoly
over
replacement
fabrics
for
ford
cars
even
though
it
wasn't
entitled
to
monopoly
rights
over
replacement
for
general
motors
cars.
this
court
then
remanded
the
case
directly
to
the
massachusetts
district
court.
the
massachusetts
district
court,
first,
entered
final
judgment,
dismissing
the
complaint
with
cause
to
petitioners
and
dismissing
petitioners'
counter
claim
without
cause.
at
the
same
time,
it
held
the
patent
valid.
we
move
to
amend
and,
accordingly,
the
district
court
struck
out
the
finding
of
validity
from
its
final
judgment
and
also
amended
the
final
judgment
to
expressly
state
that
the
dismissal
of
our
counter
claim
was
without
prejudice.
respondent
then
appealed
from
this
decision
of
the
district
court,
claiming
that
it
was
entitled
to
monopoly
rights
over
the
unpatented
replacements
for
ford
cars.
and,
petitioners
cross-appealed,
claiming
that
the
record,
then
before
the
court,
required
a
conclusion
that
not
only
had
respondent
and
its
assignor
misused
the
combination
patent
to
restrain
trade
of
non-patented
replacement
fabrics
and
was,
therefore,
barred
for
maintaining
either
an
action
for
a
direct
or
contributory
infringement,
but
also
had
violated
the
antitrust
laws.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
vacated
the
district
court
final
judgment
and
reinstated
that
portion
of
its
prior
judgment
that
had
been
reversed
by
this
court
dealing
with
replacement
fabrics
for
ford
cars.
and,
they
conferred
patent
monopoly
over
some
unpatented
replacement
fabrics
for
ford
cars,
depending
upon
the
interpretation
of
a
private
agreement
between
respondent's
assignor
and
the
ford
motor
company.
in
that
private
agreement,
ford
had
released
--
or
rather
respondent's
assignor
had
released
ford
and
owners
of
its
cars
from
liability
arising
from
the
manufacture,
use,
and
sale
of
the
patented
convertible
automobile
but
expressly
reserved
the
right
and
exercise
the
right
to
license
the
manufacture,
use,
and
sale
of
the
unpatented
replacement
fabrics.
the
court
of
appeals,
in
reviewing
the
decision
of
this
court,
said
that
what
the
court
said
in
its
opinion
gave
it
little
guidance,
but
what
the
court
did
not
say,
it
felt,
meant
that
the
court
was
not
deciding
the
question
as
to
the
unpatented
fabrics
for
so-called
“unlicensed
ford
cars.”
and,
while
the
court
of
appeals
did
quote
what
this
court
said
was
the
principle
and
determinative
question
presented
here,
whether
the
owner
of
a
combination
patent
comprised
entirely
of
unpatented
elements
has
an
additional
patent
monopoly
on
the
manufacture,
sale,
and
use
of
the
several
unpatented
components
of
the
patented
combination,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
quote
the
answer
that
this
court
gave
to
that
question.
and,
this
court
answered
that
question
by
saying
“no
element,
not
itself
separately
patented,
that
constitutes
one
of
the
elements
of
a
combination
patent
is
entitled
to
patent
monopoly,
however
essential
it
may
be
to
the
patented
combination
and
no
matter
how
difficult
or
costly
replacement
may
be.”
now,
it's
silly
to
distinguish
between
the
replacement
fabrics
for
ford
cars
and
for
general
motors
cars
because
the
replacement
fabrics
for
ford
cars
are
just
as
unpatented
as
those
for
general
motors
cars.
and,
this
court
pointed
out
the
basic
fallacy
in
respondent's
position
in
the
prior
opinion
as
follows,
which
is
just
as
applicable
today.
they
said
the
basic
fallacy
in
respondent's
position
is
that
it
requires
ascribing
to
one
element
of
the
patented
combination
the
status
of
patented
invention
in
itself.
now,
the
interlocutory
judgment
that
was
reviewed
and
reversed
previously
by
this
court
dealt
with
replacement
fabrics
for
both
ford
and
general
motors
cars,
and
whatever
was
before
the
court
was
finally
disposed
of.
and,
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
basis
for
reexamining
the
disposition
of
this
case.
the
court
recently
held
so
in
naacp
versus
alabama
in
360
u.s.,
and
that
case
cited
siebel
versus
united
states
way
back
in
12
peters.
it
is
also
inconsistent
with
the
mercoid
cases
to
confer
monopoly
rights
in
the
unpatented
replacement
fabrics
for
ford
cars.
in
the
mercoid
cases,
this
court
decided
that
the
combination
patentee
could
not
restrain
trade
or
prevent
competition
in
the
sale
of
a
non-patented
element
for
original
installation
in
a
patented
machine
that
was
sold
without
the
patentee's
consent.
a
fortiori,
the
combination
patentee
cannot
forbid
the
sale
of
a
non-patented
replacement
fabric
for
a
replacement
installation
in
a
patented
machine
that
was
sold
with
the
patentee's
consent.
now,
respondent
will
say
that
it
wasn't
sold
with
the
patentee's
consent
because
it
was
only
a
release
that
was
granted
to
the
owners
of
the
ford
cars.
but,
the
fact
is
that
respondent's
assignor
got
$73,000
from
the
ford
motor
company
in
exchange
for
release
from
all
liability
arising
from
the
manufacture,
use,
and
sale
of
these
patented
machines.
it
seems
reasonably
obvious
that
the
respondent
or
its
assignor
could
not
have
maintained
an
action
for
a
direct
infringement
against
the
ford
car
owner
after
it
had
released
the
owners
of
the
ford
cars
from
liability
and
since
a
liability
for
contributory
infringement
is
predicated
upon
their
first
being
liable
--
liability
for
a
direct
infringement.
we
do
not
see
how
respondent
could
possibly
maintain
an
action
for
a
contributory
infringement.
moreover,
if
we
accept
respondent's
contention
in
this
case,
we're
going
to
be
departing
from
a
long
line
of
patent
antitrust
cases
in
which
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
the
patentee
is
forbidden
from
expanding
the
scope
of
this
combination
patent
monopoly.
that
line
of
cases
dates
back
to
1917
when
this
court
entered
its
opinion
in
the
motion
picture
patents
case
back
in
243
u.s.
and,
only
recently,
in
united
states
versus
loews,
inc.,
this
court
restated
the
significance
of
that
line
of
cases
in
the
following
manner.
the
court
said
“these
cases
reflect
a
hostility
to
use
of
the
statutorily
granted
patent
monopoly
to
extend
the
patentee's
economic
control
to
unpatented
products.
the
patentee
is
protected
as
to
his
invention
but
may
not
use
his
patent
rights
to
exact
tribute
for
other
articles.”
and,
that's
just
exactly
what
respondent
and
its
assignor
have
done
in
this
case.
they
have
expanded
a
pair
of
combination
patent
monopolies
to
restrain
trade
in
these
unpatented
replacement
fabrics
and
we
say
that
that
conduct
is
to
be
measured
by
the
antirust
laws,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
second
mercoid
case,
the
legality
of
any
attempt
to
bring
unpatented
goods
within
the
protection
of
the
patent
is
measured
by
the
antirust
laws,
not
the
patent
law.
now,
the
court
below
didn't
say
that
the
record
didn't
show
an
antirust
law
violation.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
short
answer
to
petitioner's
claim,
as
appellants
below
seeking
relief
from
the
consequences
of
respondent's
antitrust
law
violations,
is
that
they
never
pleaded
a
cause
of
action
under
the
antitrust
laws.
well,
i'm
just
going
to
read
an
excerpt
from
the
pleading
and
you'll
notice
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
--
it's
pages
10-11,
at
the
bottom
of
page
10,
“you'll
notice
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
they
do
not
quote
any
portion
of
our
pleading.”
we
said,
in
our
answer
in
counter
claim,
said
“automobile
body
research
corporation,”
that's
respondent's
assignor,
“has
entered
into
at
least
one
licensing
agreement
and/or
has
caused
others
to
be
sublicensed
under
agreements
improperly
extending
the
scope
of
the
claim's
subject
matter
of
said
patent
and
has
thereby
misused
said
patent
and
has
improperly
restrained
commerce.”
and,
on
december
13,
1962,
the
court
of
appeals
handed
down
its
opinion
in
this
case.
10
days
before,
this
court
had
reversed
that
very
court
of
appeals
in
the
case
of
fullman
versus
davis,
and
this
is
what
the
court
said
in
considering
the
sufficiency
of
a
pleading.
if
the
--
this
was
in
371
u.s.
“if
the
underlying
facts
or
circumstances
relied
upon
by
a
pleader
may
be
a
proper
subject
of
relief,
he
ought
to
be
afforded
an
opportunity
to
test
his
claim
on
the
merits.”
mr.
charles
hieken
well,
that
--
i'm
not
to
going
to
limit
ourselves
to
that,
your
honor,
because
we
also
said
“by
virtue
of
these
facts,
automobile
body
research
corporation
has
improperly
created
a
monopoly
and
is
misusing
its
patents
and,
accordingly,
such
misuse
is
a
tribunal
move
to
the
plaintiff.”
mr.
charles
hieken
entire
--
mr.
charles
hieken
pleading
--
mr.
charles
hieken
yes,
your
honor.
now,
it's
true
that
we
did
not
cite
the
antitrust
statutes
but,
as
i
read
fullman
versus
davis
and
conley
versus
gibson
in
355
u.s.
which
preceded
it,
i
see
no
requirement
that
the
complainant
cite
the
statutes.
after
all,
it's
not
a
brief.
it's
just
a
complaint.
and
--
mr.
charles
hieken
well,
we
had
both
in
both
ways,
your
honor.
we
further
answered
by
way
of
counter
claim
and
affirmatively
sought
declaratory
relief
holding
that
the
patent
had
been
misused
and
we
also
included
a
general
prayer
for
relief
asking
the
court
to
give
us
whatever
relief
we're
entitled
to.
mr.
charles
hieken
oh,
that
is
--
well,
we
have,
i
believe
on
page
67
of
the
record.
it
seems
to
me,
i
remember
the
declaration
for
--
yes,
67.
that
this
court
find
and
enter
a
decree
herein,
holding
that
said
patent,
number
2569724,
has
been
used.
that
these
defendants
have
judgment
for
cause
and
such
other
and
further
relief
as
equity
may
require
to
this
honorable
court
may
see
the
unjust.
now,
it's
true
that
there
was
not
a
specific
prayer
for
treble
damages
but
it
is
immaterial
what
our
prayer
for
relief
is
because
rule
54
(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedures
expressly
provides
that,
except
as
to
a
final
judgment,
except
as
to
a
party
against
whom
a
judgment
is
entered
by
default,
every
final
judgment
shall
grant
the
relief
to
which
the
party
in
whose
favor
it
is
rendered
is
entitled
even
if
the
party
has
not
demanded
such
relief
in
its
pleadings.
mr.
charles
hieken
yes
it
is
in
the
record
your
honor.
the
--
part
of
it
is
in
the
prior
records,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
hieken
in
the
--
in
volume
1,
we
have
part
of
our
answer
in
counter
claim,
that's
volume
1
on
--
in
number
21
october,
term
60,
starting
at
page
8.
mr.
charles
hieken
yes
--
yes
it
is
because
a
motion
for
relief
to
use
the
record
was
granted
at
the
time
certiorari
was
granted.
so,
it
is
in
the
case,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
charles
hieken
to
the
antitrust
laws?
in
the
--
mr.
charles
hieken
no
specific
--
no,
your
honor.
we
rely
on
our
statement
that
the
--
mr.
charles
hieken
well,
we
say
that
that
when
measured,
that
as
--
that
this
is
--
we're
relying
on
the
provisions
of
rule
54
(c).
we're
saying
that
this
pleading
is
sufficient
to
support
the
introduction
of
re
--
of
evidence
in
the
record
which,
when
the
ru
--
when
the
provisions
of
rule
54
(c)
are
applied,
entitled
us
to
be
relieved
from
the
consequence
of
these
antitrust
law
violations.
this
very
same
--
if
you
look
at
the
mercoid
cases,
the
very
same
factual
happenings
were
relied
upon
by
the
court
in
finding
both
a
misuse
of
the
combination
patent
and
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
and
there
are
lower
court
decisions
which
point
out
that,
so
far
as
the
facts
are
concerned,
the
facts
which
establish
misuse
are
very
close
to
those
which
establish
an
antitrust
law
violation.
mr.
charles
hieken
no,
your
honor.
we
did
argue
that
we
were
entitled
to
relief,
but
since
the
interlocutory
judgment
reviewed
by
this
court
before
dealt
only
with
the
complaint
for
patent
infringement,
our
rights
to
relief
on
the
counter
claim
were
not
considered
and
it
--
mr.
charles
hieken
no,
your
honor.
there
was
--
only
defensively.
we
argued
misuse
defensively.
mr.
charles
hieken
go
on.
mr.
charles
hieken
yes.
mr.
charles
hieken
your
honor.
mr.
charles
hieken
no,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
hieken
yes,
your
honor.
it
had
actually
been
on
file
but
it
was
not
printed
in
the
record
until
the
second
appeal.
an
--
an
interlocutory
judgment
dealing
with
antirust
violations
is
not
subject
to
appellate
review,
and
only
an
interlocutory
judgment
for
a
patent
infringement
is.
and,
if
you
look
at
the
judgment
of
the
district
court,
which
is
at
--
in
volume
1
of
the
prior
record,
pages
42-44,
why,
you'll
see
that
there
is
absolutely
no
disposition
of
our
counter
claim.
the
sole
disposition
of
our
claim
for
concerning
misuse
is
that
it's
a
defense
which
i
find
clearly
not
made
out.
and,
one
of
the
elements
that
we
rely
upon
in
the
present
case
in
support
of
the
judgment
in
our
favor
below
is
that
there
was
additional
evidence
which
came
into
the
record
which
the
courts
below
could
have
and
should
have
looked
at,
concerning
--
mr.
charles
hieken
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
hieken
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
hieken
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
hieken
that
--
mr.
charles
hieken
that
isn't
--
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
the
--
the
--
mr.
charles
hieken
no,
i
--
mr.
charles
hieken
no
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
what
--
what
i
meant
to
say
was
that
our
counter
claim,
asking
for
affirmative
relief
for
a
declaration
the
patent
had
been
misused
was
not
here
before.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
we
argued
and
briefed
the
question
of
misuse
but
that
they
did
not
consider
our
statement
of
questions
presented
as
properly
including
the
issue
of
misuse
on
that
prior
appeal.
mr.
charles
hieken
yes,
your
honor.
but
it
was
--
this
court
said
in
a
footnote,
misuse
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
and
that
the
dissenting
justices
said
misuse
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case
at
this
time.
now,
it's
going
to
be
--
i
don't
have
the
time
to
really
discuss
the
events
that
happened
here,
but
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
form
the
record
as
to
what
happened
in
this
case.
that
this
is
a
case
where
this
respondent,
shell
su
incorporation,
was
set
up
in
the
month
of
april
of
1956,
assigned
a
territorial
grant
limited
to
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
in
this
patent
and,
in
that
same
month,
brought
this
suit
against
these
petitioners
and
the
whole
time
the
record
shows
that
that's
all
this
respondent
has
been
doing
is
maintaining
this
suit
against
these
petitioners.
and,
whenever
its
assignor
wants
some
kind
of
an
agreement
to
help
it
further
its
scheme
to
license
this
unpatented
replacement
fabrics,
right
away,
the
agreements
flow
from
respondent,
and
whenever
respondent
needs
some
additional
rights
to
come
from
respondent's
assignor,
why,
respondent's
assignor
gladly
assigns
its
--
whatever
rights
are
needed,
and
that
was
shown
in
the
record
after
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
respondent
went
all
through
this
case
until
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
with
just
a
territorial
grant,
limited
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts.
then,
after
they
win,
or
apparently
have
won,
they
get
an
assignment
from
respondent's
assignor
in
which
the
rest
of
the
rights
in
this
combination
patent
to
the
united
states
is
assigned
to
respondent.
then,
respondent
goes
into
the
district
court
and
says
“look,
i
have
all
the
rights
in
this
patent.
now,
it's
not
necessary
for
the
master
to
segregate
damages
between
massachusetts
and
the
rest
of
the
united
states.”
at
the
same
time,
he
asked
for
a
permanent
injunction,
forbidding
us
from
selling
these
unpatented
replacement
fabrics
and
then
denying
these
motions
if
this
conduct
apparently
got
too
much
for
the
district
court
because
it
said
that
it
was
not
at
all
satisfied
with
the
plaintiff's
ingenious
appearing
explanation
as
why
it
is
trying
to
increase
its
bets
now
that
its
horse
is
practically
across
the
finish
line
and,
in
all
probability,
a
winner.
so,
this
case
finally
comes
down
to
this,
your
honors.
an
owner
of
a
combination
patent
cannot
treat
an
unpatented
element
of
that
combination
as
if
it
were
patented.
and,
if
he
does,
if
an
addition
to
deriving
his
profits
from
the
patented
machine
on
which
the
law
gives
him
a
monopoly,
he
also
tries
to
derive
his
profits
from
the
unpatented
replacement
elements
necessary
to
the
continued
use
and
operation
of
the
machine,
he
violates
the
antitrust
laws
and
is
subject
to
the
consequences.
we
respectfully
urge
the
court
to
discourage
other
combination
patentees
from
repeating
the
illegal
activities
apparent
in
this
record
by
relieving
petitioners
of
the
consequences
of
respondent's
antitrust
law
violations.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
hieken
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
hieken
it
isn't
a
claim
of
a
patent,
your
honor.
our
claim
was
this.
the
patent
covered
a
--
it
was
a
combination
patent
covering
the
entire
convertible
automobile
automatic
folding
top,
and
that
was
the
limit
of
his
monopoly.
he
had
the
right
to
license
the
manufacture,
use,
and
sale
of
the
patented
convertible
automobile.
mr.
charles
hieken
yes.
mr.
charles
hieken
yes.
mr.
charles
hieken
yes.
mr.
charles
hieken
if
the
nut
and
bolt,
as
you
say,
is
a
non-patented
element
of
the
patented
combination,
yes,
that
is
corre7ct.
but,
in
the
mercoid
case
--
mr.
charles
hieken
yes.
mr.
charles
hieken
well,
your
honor,
in
1944,
20
years
ago,
in
an
--
in
a
case
where
it
wasn't
a
question
of
a
replacement
element,
where
the
patentee
was
attempting
to
derive
his
profit
from
the
original
sale
and
use
of
the
patented
combination,
this
court
says
that
--
said
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
claims
and
you
can
only
license
in
your
--
what
you
claim
and
it's
important
that
we
have
this
rule.
the
statute
says
if
you
want
to
exercise
patent
monopoly
over
something,
you
have
to
particularly
point
out
and
distinctly
claim
the
subject
matter
which
you
regard
as
the
invention.
and,
this
court
pointed
out
in
general
--
think
it
was
general
electric
company
versus
wabash
company
that
the
importance
of
having
these
claims
that
is
not
only
do
the
claim
service
as
a
basis
by
which
the
patent
office
examiner
can
examine
the
alleged
inventive
subject
matter
to
compare
to
the
--
with
the
prior
or
to
see
if
it
is
an
invention,
but
it
also
serves
as
a
basis
for
letting
an
ordinary
businessman
know
what
is
the
scope
of
the
monopoly
of
the
combination
of
the
patent
monopoly.
so,
he
ought
to
be
able
to
pick
up
a
patent
document
and
see
whether
he
makes
an
ordinary
unpatented
article,
like
this
piece
of
fabric,
whether
he
infringes
the
patent.
mr.
charles
hieken
well,
it's
hard
to
say
that
this
is
a
good
faith
mistake,
your
honor,
when
you
see
the
f
--
when
you
see
the
formation
of
this
shell
corporation.
mr.
charles
hieken
was
that
considered
wrong?
mr.
charles
hieken
i
--
i
think
so,
your
honor,
yes.
the
court
of
appeals
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
first
time
around,
made
the
very
serious
error
that
they
call
the
unpatented
element
of
the
patented
combination.
they
called
it
patented,
and
the
court
pointed
out
of
course,
in
accordance
with
a
long
line
of
decisions,
that
in
order
for
a
thing
to
be
patented,
it
must
be
separately
claimed.
and,
even
in
morgan
envelope
case,
an
old
case.
it
was
pointed
out
a
long
time
ago
that
if
you
want
to
exercise
patent
monopoly
over
a
non
--
over
a
single
element
of
a
combination,
you
have
to
claim
it
separately
in
a
valid
patent.
there
was
a
case
where
the
claim
to
the
oval
toilet-paper
roll
was
held
invalid
and
so,
the
patentee
couldn't
exercise
monopoly
rights
on
the
combination
of
the
holder
in
the
toilet-paper
roll.
mr.
charles
hieken
excuse
me.
mr.
charles
hieken
this
--
this
is
a
possible
--
this
is
possible
--
mr.
charles
hieken
way
of
--
it's
an
alternative
ground.
that's
right,
yes,
your
honor.
but
we
say
that
--
mr.
charles
hieken
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
--
in
as
far
as
dealing
with
the
complaint
for
patent
infringement,
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
hieken
i
think
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
did.
i
think
it
just
made
the
plain
statement
--
the
plain
logical
statement
that
the
making
--
that
the
installation
of
a
non-patented
element
in
a
patented
combination
is
not
a
making
of
the
patented
combination
and,
therefore,
not
a
direct
infringement.
the
use
of
that
unpatented
element
is
not
the
use
of
the
whole
patented
combination
and,
therefore,
not
--
mr.
charles
hieken
oh
--
mr.
charles
hieken
yes
your
honor.
and,
there
is
no
explanation
as
to
why
the
court
said
misuse
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
hieken
right.
i
--
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
hieken
no,
we
don't
know
at
the
present
time,
your
honor.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
which
shows
that
petitioners
have
been
held
lia
--
something
several
thousand
dollars
worth
of
attorney's
fees
in
this
case
and
every
court
of
appeals
decision
that
has
considered
the
case
has
held
that
attorney's
fees
expend
in
connection
with
defending
a
patent
infringement
suit
brought
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
as
a
part
of
a
combination
conspiracy,
is
an
element
of
damages
to
be
trebled.
thank
you.
