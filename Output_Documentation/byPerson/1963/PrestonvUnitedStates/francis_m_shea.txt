mr.
francis
m.
shea
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
sixth
circuit.
the
basic
questions
presented
are
whether
it
was
error
in
the
district
court
to
admit
evidence
which
we
assert
was
the
fruit
of
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
secondly,
although
the
defendant,
petitioner
here,
enjoyed
the
assistance
of
counsel
required
by
the
sixth
amendment.
the
facts
are
briefly
these.
police,
two
police
cruisers
received
a
message
from
headquarters
that
three
men
in
a
buick
car
were
sitting
on
a
street
at
new
port
kentucky
and
had
been
sitting
there
for
some
five
hours.
one
of
the
men
had
left
the
car
and
then
came
back
to
it
and
they
were
instructed
to
go
and
investigate.
they
went
to
the
scene
and
found
there
three
men,
i
think
one
was
standing
beside
the
car
and
the
other
two
in
it,
this
was
at
3
o'clock
in
the
morning,
in
the
business
district,
they
were
parked
right
in
the
neighborhood
of
a
night
club,
the
marquee
of
which
was
still
lighted.
they
ordered
the
men
out
of
the
car
and
frisked
them
for
weapons.
they
then
interrogated
them
and
discovered
that
none
of
them
were
employed.
one
had
been
without
employment
for
some
six
months.
one
of
the
persons,
sykes
said
that
he
had
bought
the
buick
car
the
day
before,
but
he
didn't
have
title
papers
with
him.
they
had
$0.25
cents
between
them.
their
responses
to
questions
the
police
said
were
evasive,
but
this
is
not
particularized
in
the
record.
they
said
they
were
there
waiting
for
a
person
named
saxton,
who
is
coming
in
on
a
trailer
truck
from
a
town
some
hundred
miles
away
and
who
it
was
believed
could
help
strunk
and
petitioner
to
find
employment.
they
couldn't
inform
the
officers
as
to
the
company
that
saxton
worked
for
and
of
the
kind
of
truck
he
was
driving.
in
response
to
the
question
of
how
they
would
recognize
him,
sykes
said
that
he
normally
stopped
for
a
cup
of
coffee
about
a
block
down
from
where
they
were
parked
and
in
response
to
the
question
of
why
they
weren't
parked
down
there;
the
police
thought
that
they
gave
evasive
answers.
on
this
basis
they
were
arrested,
they
were
taken
to
the
police
station
in
one
of
the
cruisers.
the
buick
car
was
driven
to
the
police
station
and
then
towed
to
a
nearby
parking
lot.
at
the
police
station
the
police
commenced
their
interrogation.
sykes
asked
permission
to
go
to
the
car
to
get
some
cigarettes,
he
was
denied
permission,
but
the
officers
then
went
down
to
search
the
car.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
this
was
at
the
request
of
sykes
or
with
his
permission.
in
searching
the
car
they
found
in
the
glove
compartment
two
loaded
revolvers.
they
attempted
to
open
the
trunk
of
the
car
but
were
unable
to
with
the
keys
they
had
taken
from
sykes.
they
returned
then
to
the
station
and
one
of
the
detectives,
chapiarni
sent
doxson,
one
of
the
uniformed
officers
down
to
see
if
he
could
get
into
the
car.
doxson
with
the
aid
of
the
persons
at
the
parking
lot,
pulled
out
the
back
seat,
removed
the
partition
between
the
back
seat
and
the
trunk
and
found
there,
two
women's
stockings,
knotted
at
the
top
and
one
of
them
with
eye
holes
in
it.
four
caps,
two
of
them
split
in
the
back,
two
lengths
of
rope,
a
piece
of
fishing
line,
a
false
kentucky
license
with
hooks
that
catch,
that
could
be
slipped
over
and
hung
on
to
another
plate
and
two
pair
of
gloves.
they
then
proceed
with
their
interrogation
and
sykes
confessed
that
he
and
two
others,
but
not
strunk
or
petitioner,
had
planned
to
rob
the
bank
at
berry,
kentucky.
at
this
point
they
called
in
the
fbi,
because
it
was
a
federally
insured
bank.
they
had
lodged
when
they
found
the
revolvers
a
further
charge
of
carrying
concealed
and
deadly
weapons,
but
neither
--
and
when
they
came
to
the
station
initially
they
booked
the
three
for
vagrancy.
the
vagrancy
charge
and
the
charge
of
carrying
concealed
weapons
so
far
as
the
record
discloses
where
never
tried.
some
functionary
of
the
local
court
said
they
were
adopted
by
the
federal
prosecutor.
so
they
were
brought
to
trial
on
a
charge
of
conspiring
to
rob
a
federally
insured
bank
and
convicted.
these
i
think
are
the
facts
pertinent
to
the
issues
which
are
before
you,
but
i
might
note
that
at
the
trial
the
only
evidence
against
petitioner
was
the
testimony
of
a
bartender
that
he
had
heard
a
conversation
between
petitioner
and
strunk
and
sykes
that
they
had
a
big
job
on.
on
cross
examination,
he
said
that
he
didn't
whether
that
was
installing
a
large
furnace
or
what
it
might
have
been
and
the
shopkeeper
in
berry
said
that
he
had
seen
sykes
and
he
could
pretty
well
identify
petitioner
driving
slowly
through
the
town
and
carefully
looking
about.
and
there
was
the
testimony
of
an
fbi
agent
that
petitioner
had
admitted
to
him
that
he
had
talked
about
robbing
the
bank
at
berry,
it
was
in
a
preliminary
stage.
petitioner
testified
he
never
talked
about
any
bani
in
berry.
what
he
had
said
was
--
what
he
had
meant
by
preliminary
talk
was
that
sykes
had
come
in
to
him
and
strunk
had
said
that
he
had
a
chance
of
making
$5,000
and
strunk
had
said
well
that
must
be
robbing
a
bank
and
he
said,
how
did
you
know,
and
at
that
point
strunk
said,
well
i
just
don't
want
to
hear
anymore
about
it
(inaudible).
on
this
evidence
and
the
evidence
in
question
here,
petitioner
was
convicted.
the
solicitor
general
has
expressed
concern
that
as
to
whether
or
not
this
evidence
was
sufficient
to
go
to
a
jury.
i
share
his
concern.
that
question
is
open
to
this
court
if
it
chooses
to
deal
with
it,
but
i
assume
certiorari
was
granted
to
deal
without
the
question
and
i
turned
to
this
question.
in
our
original
brief,
we
addressed
ourselves
to
what
we
had
supposed
and
still
believe
was
the
statute
on
the
basis
of
which
these
men
were
arrested
for
vagrancy
and
the
court
will
find
that
setout
on
page
three
of
our
initial
brief
and
with
your
indulgence
i
should
like
to
read
it
with
you.
any
person
guilty
of
being
a
vagrant
shall
to
the
first
offense
be
fined
$10
or
imprisoned
for
30
days
or
both,
for
the
second
and
each
subsequent
offence
he
shall
be
imprisoned
for
60
days.
vagrant
is
used
in
subsection
1
of
this
section
and
krs
436530
means,
any
able
bodied
male
person
who
habitually,
habitually
loiters
or
rambles
about
without
means
to
support
himself
and
who
has
no
occupation
at
which
to
earn
an
honest
livelihood
or
any
able
bodied
male
person
without
visible
means
of
support
who
habitually
fails
to
engage
in
honest
labor
for
his
own
support,
support
of
his
family
if
he
has
one
or
any
idle
and
dissolute
able
bodied
male
person
who
purposely
desserts
his
wife
or
children
be
any
of
them
without
suitable
subsistence,
suitable
means
of
subsistence,
or
any
able
bodied
person
without
visible
means
of
support
who
habitually
refuses
to
work
and
who
habitually
loiters
on
the
streets
or
public
places
of
any
city.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
i
should
think
that
was
public.
in
our
initial
brief,
we
argued
that
under
this
statute
certainly
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
arrest
because
these
officers
knew
nothing
of
these
men
prior
to
the
time
they
encountered
them
on
this
occasion
on
the
streets
of
new
port
and
therefore
there
could
be
no
possible
basis
for
them
to
conclude
that
there
was
probable
cause
of
the
violation
of
this
ordinance.
the
solicitor
general
now
concedes
that
that
is
the
case
and
so
this
ordinance
is
out
of
the
case,
but
he
retreats
to
other
ground.
he
says
that,
this
statute,
he
says
there
is
an
ordinance
of
the
city
of
new
port
and
if
that
ordinance
is
also
a
vagrancy
law
and
that
the
police
might
just
as
well
have
had
in
mind
the
new
port
ordinance
as
the
state
statute
and
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
that
the
burden
was
on
the
petitioner
to
clarify
that
doubt
in
the
court
below
and
therefore
he,
the
solicitor
general,
may
defend
on
the
ground
that
the
arrest
was
under
the
ordinance,
and
there
was
probable
cause
to
conclude
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
ordinance.
and
then
he
says
further
that
even
if
this
isn't
so,
even
if
the
arrest
was
not
under
the
ordinance,
nevertheless
if
there
was
some
statute
which
if
the
police
had
any
in
mind
at
the
time
of
arrest,
would
have
furnished
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
even
if
they
didn't
have
that
in
mind.
the
solicitor
general
may
now
rely
on
those
laws
to
justify
the
arrest
and
he
says
that
there
are
two
sets
of
laws,
that
there
was
reasonable
cause
to
believe,
that
the
automobile
was
stolen
and
there
was
the
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
new
port
ordinance
had
been
violated
and
lastly
he
says
that
even
if
he
can't
justify
this
search
and
seizure
as
incident
to
a
valid
arrest,
nevertheless
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
automobile
was
stolen
that
in
itself
would
justify
a
search
without
a
warrant.
let
me
address
myself
to
each
of
these
contentions.
first
he
contends,
as
i
suggested,
that
he
can
rely
on
that
new
port
ordinance,
but
that
may
have
been
what
the
officer
had
in
my
mind.
let
me
ask
the
court
again
to
indulge
me
in
reading
with
you
the
terms
of
that
ordinance.
it
is
setout
on
page
two
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief.
it
reads
“loitering,
loitering
penalty,”
“that
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
not
having
a
illegitimate
business
or
visible
means
of
support
to
in
an
idle,
dissolute,
disreputable,
or
eloping
way
to
loiter
around
the
streets
within
the
limits
of
the
city
of
new
port
and
any
person
so
offending
shall
be
on
conviction
thereof
fined
any
sum
not
exceeding
$15.”
i
should
like
ask
your
honors
to
know
that
the
vagrancy
statute
of
the
state
of
kentucky
and
this
ordinance
are
fundamentally
different
pieces
of
legislation.
the
state
statute
punishes
for
a
status
crime,
not
for
an
act
or
omission.
it's
for
the
habitual
doing
of
things,
the
character
that
the
man
has
assumed.
the
ordinance
punishes
for
an
act
so
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
fungible
goods,
we
are
dealing
with
fundamentally
different
legal
provision.
now,
if
the
court
please,
these
men,
according
to
the
testimony
of
each
of
the
officers
who
testified,
were
arrested
for
vagrancy.
they
were
booked
for
vagrancy.
the
prosecutor
tried
the
case
in
terms
of
vagrancy.
petitioners
counsel
sought
to
establish
that
they
weren't
vagrants
within
the
meaning
of
the
kentucky
statute
and
when
the
solicitor
general
filed
his
brief
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
he
argued
on
the
basis
of
the
kentucky
statute.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
statute
of
kentucky
says
on
its
face
vagrancy,
the
ordinance
says
on
its
face
loitering.
now
there
are
interchangeable
words
in
it
too,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
so
far
as
anything
in
this
record
would
permit
us
to
determine
which
law
the
police
were
relying
on,
it
is
the
vagrancy
statute.
let
me
address
myself
to
the
point
that
it
was
petitioner's
burden
to
get
this
clarified
below.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes.
if
i
understand
correctly
the
disposition
of
this
court
on
the
matter,
the
statement
of
this
court
in
jeffers,
the
statement
of
this
court
in
jones,
the
rule
is
that
you
must
have
a
warrant
to
arrest
or
search
and
seize.
there
are
exceptions,
but
the
general
rule
is
zealously
guarded
and
whoever
relies
on
an
exception
has
the
burden
of
establishing
the
applicability
of
the
exception.
it
seems
to
me
this
suggests
if
there
was
any
ambiguity,
it
was
the
government's
burden
and
not
ours.
moreover
counsel
for
the
petitioner
did
it
seems
to
me
all
he
could
do.
he
asked
these
officers
on
the
stand
what
they
charged
these
men
with
and
they
said
vagrancy.
it
was
the
prosecutor
who
knew
what
it
was
they
had
in
mind
and
he
thought
that
there
was
ambiguity
or
that
defense
counsel
were
be
mislead,
it
seemed
to
me
he
had
a
clear
obligation
to
clarify.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
that's
right.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
no
it
never
came
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes
he
is
--
counsel
for
petitioner
at
the
opening
sought
to
suppress
some
of
the
close
--
of
the
government's
case,
made
his
motion,
addressed
to
that
and
also
closed
the
whole
case,
i
may
have
misspoken.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
not
a
ground
on
which
the
government
can
properly
rely.
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
second
point.
the
second
point
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes.
well
the
record
is
replete,
replete
with
the
fact
that
vagrancy
was
what
was
being
discussed.
now,
what
the
government
tries
to
say
is
well
the
ordinance
of
vagrancy
too.
let
me
turn
to
this
second
point
which
the
government
makes
and
that
is
that
even
though
the
officers
arrested
under
the
vagrancy
statute
of
the
state,
nevertheless
if
there
is
some
law
under
which
they
might
have
arrested,
which
would
have
given
them
probable
cause
to
believe
that,
that
law
had
been
violated,
they
may
now
rely
on
that
to
sustain
the
validity
of
the
arrest,
and
first
they
say
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
car
was
stolen
and
secondly
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
new
court
ordinance
was
violated.
well
of
course
this
was
the
question
left
open
in
the
reed,
but
if
i
read
accurately
the
decisions
of
this
court
it
seems
to
me
a
point
which
was
foreclosed
in
jones
and
in
chapman.
moreover,
the
government
asserts
and
i
suppose
rightly
with
an
exception
that
i
think
is
not
pertinent
here,
that
the
validity
of
the
arrest
by
a
state
officer
under
a
state
statute
is
to
be
tested
by
state
law
and
in
four
cases
which
we
have
cited
to
you,
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
kentucky
has
held
in
false
arrest
cases,
that
where
the
police
arrest
on
one
ground
and
kentucky
has
a
notice
provision
requiring
them
to
inform
the
defendant
of
the
ground
of
the
arrest,
where
the
police
arrests
on
one
ground
they
may
not
subsequently
justify
on
the
basis
of
a
different
ground
or
a
different
law.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
counsel
in
this
regard
is
leaning
on
rather
a
weak
ground.
now
let
me
assume
that
he
can
rely
on
these
two
other
laws.
he
asserts
that
though
the
statute
of
kentucky
provides
that
an
arrest
maybe
made
for
a
public
offence
if
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
officer
or
for
a
felony
if
there
was
reasonable
cause
to
believe,
which
sounds
certainly
very
much
like
the
common
law
provision,
he
asserts
that
this
has
been
construed
by
the
courts
of
kentucky
to
mean
that
in
the
case
of
a
misdemeanor
such
is
a
violation
of
a
vagrancy
or
a
loitering
statute,
that
the
arrest
maybe
validly
made
if
done
in
good
faith,
with
probable
cause
to
believe
and
where
the
probable
cause
derived
from
his
senses
or
admissions
of
the
defendants
but
not
third
parties
and
i
think
he
has
some
authority
to
this,
i
think
it's
a
doubtful
area.
i'm
not
going
to
address
myself
to
it,
the
reasons
for
the
doubts
are
set
out
in
the
brief.
i'm
going
to
assume
for
these
purposes
that
if
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
the
arrest
could
be
justified.
let
me
address
myself
first
to
probably
cause
to
believe
the
car
was
stolen,
the
evidence
was
that
sykes
was
at
the
wheel
of
the
car.
he
said
he
had
bought
it
the
day
before.
he
didn't
have
title
papers.
it
was
sitting
in
the
middle
of
newport,
where
one
would
hardly
expect
a
person
who
had
stolen
a
car
to
leave
it
or
to
sit
in
it,
the
most
obvious
place
for
apprehension.
the
things
that
are
not
said
in
the
record
are
even
more
critical.
no
suggestion
that
there
had
been
any
report
from
headquarters
of
the
stolen
car.
no
suggestion,
even
though
the
officers
had
been
informed
from
the
who
the
car
had
been
bought,
that
they
made
any
effort
to
check
whether
it
had
or
not.
it
seems
to
me
on
this
record
the
solicitor
general
has
a
very
considerable
burden
to
bear,
to
persuade
this
court
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
on
the
grounds
that
the
car
had
been
stolen.
secondly,
let
me
turn
to
question
of
whether
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
this
ordinance
of
kentucky
had
been
violated.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
the
officers
had
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
these
persons
had
no
legitimate
business
unless
that
means
that
they
were
unemployed
or
if
they
had
any
visible
means
of
support
whatever
that
maybe,
some
of
the
courts
accept
it's
not
enough
to
establish
that
you
have
money
in
your
pocket
or
money
you
derived
from
begging,
but
it
is
enough
if
it's
derived
from
gambling,
what
that
means
i
don't
know,
but
in
any
event
no
effort
to
establish
it,
nothing
to
show
that
they
were
idle,
dissolute,
disreputable,
loafing.
i
suppose
what
i'm
basically
saying
is
that
under
an
ordinance
as
vague
as
this,
even
if
the
effort
had
been
made
and
the
effort
was
not
made,
it
would
be
impossible
to
show
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
and
this
carries
this
into
the
constitutional
question.
i
defy
any
intelligent
man
that
if
that
be
the
test
to
know
whether
he
was
or
wasn't
committing
a
crime
under
these
vague
words.
the
solicitor
general
concedes
that
there
is
a
good
deal
of
vagueness
at
the
periphery,
but
they
suggest
that
at
the
core
of
this
ordinance,
there
is
a
hardcore
with
adequate
definition
to
support
it
against
a
charge
of
unconstitutional
vagueness
and
this
hardcore,
to
use
their
words,
is
this.
“just
ordinary
standing
or
sitting,”
this
is
on
page
19
in
this
brief
on
the
footnote,
“just
ordinary
standing
or
sitting
is
not
prohibited.
loitering
in
a
suspicious
manner
on
the
other
hand
satisfied
this
element
of
the
crime.”
as
i
read
this,
it
makes
the
officer's
state
of
mind,
the
petitioner's
crime.
i
don't
know
what
else,
where
else
you
get
suspicion
expect
in
the
officer's
mind.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
quiet
sir.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
that's
quite
sir.
the
government
further
says
on
page
20,
the
ordinance
involved
here,
here
is
another
summary
of
a
hardcore,
the
ordinance
involved
here
is
plainly
aimed
at
persons
who,
this
is
the
government's
statement
of
the
hardcore,
i
mean
they
say
their
vagueness
is
periphery,
the
ordinance
involved
here
is
plainly
aimed
at
persons
who
having
no
employment
or
a
legal
source
of
income
remain
on
the
streets
without
any
valid
reason
for
their
presence.
now
if
i
read
this
accurately,
i
would
suppose
that
a
man
who
had
been
unemployed
and
whose
unemployment
insurance
had
just
expired,
who
for
no
reason
except
he
was
sick
of
being
cooped
up,
wandered
around
the
streets
of
newport
looking
into
the
store
windows,
would
be
guilty
of
a
crime
under
this
ordinance.
and
i
suggest
your
honors
if
this
is
the
best
the
solicitor
general
can
do
with
this
ordinance,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
lanzetta,
it
seems
to
me
is
clearly
applicable
and
that
this
ordinance
cannot
withstand
constitutional
attack.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
according
to
the
information
relayed
to
the
car
from
headquarters,
received
from
an
unidentified
person,
five
hours.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
3
o'clock
in
the
morning
was
when
he
was
picked.
this
is
according
to
what
--
on
double
hearsay
was
what
an
unidentified
person
said.
so
far
as
what
the
officers
have
otherwise,
at
the
time,
one
of
the
officers
testified
that
one
of
the
men
said
they
had
been
in
the
vicinity
for
some
time.
it
is
not
clear
to
me
whether
that
meant.
they
had
been
living
around
that
area
for
some
time
or
whether
it
was
directed
to
how
long
they
had
been
there,
but
that's
what
they
had.
that
is
what
they
stated
to
the
officer.
now,
if
the
court
please,
even
if
the
solicitor
general
were
able
to
establish
the
validity
of
the
arrest,
i
do
not
think
it
would
give
him
lasting
comfort.
let
me
turn
first
to
the
question
of
whether
the
arrest
could
have
been
justified
on
the
basis
of
a
--
i
mean
search
and
seizure
could
have
been
justified
on
the
basis
of
a
valid
arrest
under
the
ordinance.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
i
should
suppose
that
might
be
a
reasonable
defense
to
an
action
for
false
arrest,
but
when
we
are
dealing
with
an
issue
of
a
lawful
search
and
seizure,
while
they
may
have
had
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
let
us
say
that
the
men
were
loitering
in
a
dissolute
manner
however,
according
to
what
they
understood
this
to
be.
they
didn't
have
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
a
crime
was
committed
if
this
ordinance
is
unconstitutional,
it
seems
to
me.
furthermore,
the
risk
has
to
be
thrust
somewhere,
either
the
risk
is
on
the
police
or
the
risk
is
on
a
man
who
if
it
is
unconstitutional
is
doing
a
legally
protected
thing,
in
those
circumstances
it
seems
to
me
the
risk
should
fall
on
the
police.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
i
am
not
sure
that
i
follow
that
if
the
court
please?
i
mean
there
are
circumstances
in
which
it
may
be
contested,
maybe
stricter
in
the
false
arrest
area,
but
for
instance
the
kentucky
court
states
that
they
are
much
stricter,
where
the
issue
is
one
of
search
and
seizure
and
they
are
words,
a
question
of
justifying
the
arrest.
perhaps
i
don't
address
myself
to
your
precise
point,
but
they
are
different
is
all
i
suggest,
you
may
excuse
the
officer,
you
may
excuse
the
officer
if
he
with
his
limited
scope
and
his
inadequate
indoctrination,
thought
that
this
statute
may
have
put
the
police
at
--
and
uneducated
believed
it
to
be
for
sometime,
perhaps
you
can
excuse
him
on
that
ground,
i
don't
think
you
can
excuse
on
that
ground
the
use
of
testimony,
evidence
collected
on
the
basis
of
the
unconstitutional
arrest.
let
me
turn
to,
i
have
done
my
best
mr.
justice.
i
have
done
my
best.
i
don't
know
whether
i
have
satisfied
you.
let
me
now
turn
my
attention
to
the
question
of
even
assuming
a
valid
arrest
as
i
suggested,
under
the
ordinance
whether
the
search
and
seizure
were
justified.
i
take
it
that
harris
and
rabinowitz
mark
the
outer
limits
of
the
premise
and
i
have
no
need
to
attack
those
cases
here.
i
take
it
that
they
say
at
most
you
must
confine
yourself
to
a
search
for
the
fruits
of
crimes
or
the
instruments
for
its
commission
or
means
of
escape
or
harm
to
the
officer.
now
what
are
the
fruits
of
the
crime
of
vagrancy
for
which
they
were
searching,
what
are
the
instruments
for
its
commission
for
which
they
are
searching.
i
suggest
that
there
can't
be
any
justification
on
those
grounds
and
the
government,
seeing
the
difficulty
of
that
position,
suggests
that
not
only
have
they
justified
searching
for
the
fruits
of
the
crime
for
which
they
have
arrested,
the
instruments
for
its
commission,
but
the
fruits
or
instruments
for
commission
of
related
crime.
they
have
not
cited
authority
to
the
proposition
and
it
seems
to
me
what
this
means
is
the
thing
which
was
most
directly
condemned
by
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
case
of
an
arrest
on
suspicion
or
for
vagrancy
a
general
search
without
a
warrant.
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
question
of
reasonableness
of
the
search
assuming
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
the
car
was
stolen.
i
take
it
that
would
have
justified
seizure
of
the
car,
but
here
was
the
car
in
parking
lot,
no
chance
of
it
ever
being
moved,
we
don't
have
any
carroll
situation,
under
the
complete
dominion
of
the
police
and
the
question
is
could
they
in
most
circumstances
ransack
that
car
without
a
warrant.
now,
i
take
it
that
rabinowitz
in
overruling
earlier
cases
said
that
the
practicability
of
getting
a
warrant
was
not
controlling,
but
i
don't
understand
to
say
that
it
isn't
relevant
and
indeed
the
strong
statements
of
this
court,
especially
of
the
statement
in
jones,
the
strong
statements
of
this
court
that
the
rule
is
a
warrant,
a
rule
zealously
guarded
and
that
you
are
going
to
part
from
the
law
you
must
justify
yourself
on
the
basis
of
bringing
yourself
carefully
with
an
exception.
i
would
suppose
this
suggests
that
where
it's
practicable,
there
is
not
difficulty
about
seeking
a
warrant
and
there
are
no
considerations
as
there
are
none
in
this
case
to
suggest
the
necessity
of
proceeding
without
a
warrant,
that
a
warrant
is
required
and
so
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
even
if
the
arrest
on
the
grounds
of
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
car
was
stolen
wouldn't
have
justified
ransacking
it.
certainly
you
weren't
likely
in
the
trunk
the
means
of
stealing
the
car
or
the
fruits,
the
fruits
of
the
car
itself
what
you
could
find
with
evidence.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well,
to
make
the
argument
--
it
depends
now
on,
i
mean
we
are
assuming
i
take
it
a
valid
arrest
–
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes
i'm
assuming
a
valid
arrest
on
the
ground
that
the
car
was
stolen.
i
would
suppose
at
the
scene,
they
might
well
have
justified
the
search
for
weapons
or
means
of
escape,
i
should
think.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
i
should
think
that
might
well
be
critical
in
the
question
of
the
application
of
rule
1.
i
mean
if
one
is
to
judge
the
reasonableness
of
it
in
terms
of
a
variety
of
considerations
of
which
one
certainly
is
how
jealously
guarded
should
be
the
searches
without
warrant
and
there
are
no,
there
is
no
reason
to
suspect
they
could
escape
or
attack
the
officer
or
dispose
of
anything
once
it's
within
the
custody
of
police,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
force
of
the
rule
heightens
and
the
exception
lessens
in
those
circumstances.
now,
let
me
finally
address
myself
--
let
me
finally
address
myself
to
the
point
of
the
assistance
of
counsel
in
this
case.
two
attorneys
were
appointed
jointly
to
represent
three
men
in
a
conspiracy
case.
the
government
suggests
that
this
is
a
matter
of
trail
tactics
as
to
whether
two
lawyers
could
adequately
represent
three
jointly.
i
think
anyone
who
has
had
experiences
representing
two
clients
and
then
pursue
it
identically
in
a
civil
case
would
testify
that
you
never
know
when
you
want
to
disassociate
the
one
from
the
other
and
i
need
mention
only
one
point
in
this
connection
in
this
case.
it
seems
to
me
clearly
any
lawyer
defending
petitioner
whose
sole
loyalty
to,
was
two
petitioner
would
have
attempted
to
show
well
psyches
perhaps
know
about
all
those
guns
and
the
other
paraphernalia
in
the
trunk,
that
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
petitioner
knew
anything
about
it,
but
he
could
only
make
that
point
sharply
if
he
had
no
loyalty
to
cite.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
they
did
not.
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
this
is
the
situation
falling
as
far
i
see
squarely
within
(inaudible).
your
honor
this
is
our
case.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
mr.
justice
clark,
the
record
reference
of
the
point,
the
car
was
towed
to
a
parking
station
and
garage
is
found
on
the
bottom
of
the
page
61
and
the
top
of
the
page
62.
unless
the
court
has
questions
on
that,
i
have
nothing
to
add.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
very
pleasure
to
appear
before
this
court
your
honor.
