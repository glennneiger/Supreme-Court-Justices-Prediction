mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
view
the
case,
the
principal
issue
involved
is
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
and
not
whether
particular
the
kentucky
legislation
would
sustain
a
conviction
either
under
a
loitering
statute
or
a
vagrancy
statute.
the
issue
is
whether
the
fourth
amendment
forbids
the
use
in
evidence
in
a
federal
case
of
evidence
obtained
by
state
officers
as
a
consequence
of
the
3
a.m.
search
primarily
of
the
glove
compartment
of
an
automobile
which
had
been
parked
on
a
city
street
for
five
hours
after
the
officers
went
out
and
interrogated
the
men
in
response
to
a
complaint
of
citizens.
now
we
believe
that
this
search
which
was
conducted
was
reasonable
and
we
make
three
–
there
are
three
reasons
why
we
make
that
contention.
we
think
the
search
was
incident
to
an
arrest
under
the
newport
loitering
ordinance.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
all
right,
your
honor,
i
think
you
have
to
first
examine
how
this
issue
arose
under
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
the
word,
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
only
word
mentioned
is
‘vagrancy'
and
we
say
that
word
is
broad
enough
to
embrace
loitering.
the
vagrancy
statute
here
involved
has
in
three
of
its
subsections
forbids
loitering.
now
what
we
say
in
this
situation,
whether
or
not,
if
i
give
an
illustration,
if
an
officer
arrests
the
man
for
a
murder
and
he
only
has
probable
--
he
doesn't
have
probable
cause
for
murder
and
he
only
has
probable
cause
for
manslaughter,
we
say
the
arrest
of
him
become
invalid
under
such
circumstances
and
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
we
make
two
contentions.
one
we
make
the
contention,
he
was
arrested
for
vagrancy
and
we
do
not
know
under
this
record
whether
in
--
at
the
time
he
is
arrested
for
vagrancy
whether
or
not
that
vagrancy
included
loitering
or
not.
certainly,
the
police
when
they
went
to
scene
didn't
arrest
just
these
men
because
they
were
unemployed.
they
arrested
them
because
they
were
there.
they
didn't
have
title
papers
to
the
car.
they
gave
an
explanation
which
was
completely
evasive
and
improbable
as
to
why
they
were
there.
if
it
was
just
a
situation
of
unemployed
men
standing
abut,
but
i
don't
think
anybody
in
examining
this
record
will
say
the
police
would
have
arrested
them.
so
in
a
sense
when
they
arrested
them
for
vagrancy,
i
think
the
vagrancy
and
given
the
fact
that
vagrancy
has
common
elements
with
law
--
with
loitering,
if
you
want
to
say
that
they
are
different
in
a
sense
that
they
were
arrested
for
both
offences.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
–
no,
well
of
course
vagrancy,
vagrancy
is
one
that's
a
general
term
and
embraces
a
whole
category
of
offences
and
vagrancy
is
a
term
which
we
think
is
broad
enough
to
embrace
loitering.
now
as
far
as
how
this
record
was
made,
no
body
in
either
court
below
ever
focused
any
attention
on
any
particular
legislation,
petitioners
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
alleging
that
there
was
an
unlawful
--
unlawful
search
and
seizure.
they
put
on
in
testimony.
the
three
of
the
four
arresting
officers,
the
officers
testified
they
have
--
they
arrested
the
defendants
for
vagrancy.
they
spelled
out
that
the
fact
that
the
--
the
fact
that
the
men
were
unemployed
wasn't
the
sole
reason
for
the
arrest,
but
the
arrest
was
made
because
of
the
other
circumstances
surrounding
the
men.
now
petitioner's
argument
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
its
principal
contention
was
you
can't
introduce
this
evidence
because
there
have
--
because
the
kentucky
courts
have
not
made
a
judicial
determination
whether
the
arrest
is
legal
or
not.
this
is
an
argument
which
this
court
rejected
in
elkins
and
that
was
the
entire
contention
which
was
made
in
the
district
court
and
if
there
is
any
vagueness
about
the
contention
made
in
the
district
court,
it
certainly
clarified
when
you
look
at
what
the
argument
petitioner
made
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
his
sole
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
was,
you
can't
introduce
this
evidence
because
there
hasn't
been
a
judicial
determination
in
the
kentucky
court.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
only
thing
as
the
record
indicates
that
they
were
charged
with
vagrancy.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
as
i
understand
kentucky
law
that
creates
a
complication.
in
kentucky
--
under
kentucky
law
apparently
the
same
court
which
has
jurisdiction
or
under
the
kentucky
vagrancy
to
hear
offences
under
the
kentucky
vagrancy
statute,
has
jurisdiction
to
hear
offences
under
the
newport
ordinance,
loitering
ordinance
and
apparently
there
unlike
some
police
courts
where
written
pleadings
are
filed,
no
written
pleadings
were
filed
in
the
court.
and
in
the
absence
of
somebody
making
in
a
--
filing
a
request
for
a
bill
of
particulars,
since
this
case
wasn't
prosecuted
you
can't
say
whether
the
intent
was
to
proceed
under
vagrancy,
loitering
or
both,
i
mean
as
far
as
what
is
in
the
court
records
are
concerned.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
your
honor,
i
don't
know
what
the
rule
in
kentucky
is.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
don't
know
what
the
federal
court
has,
i
know
some
courts
have
a
rule
that
--
kentucky
rule
that
judicial
notice
isn't
taken
of
ordinances.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
say
i
concede
that
some
courts
have
a
rule
that,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
federal
rule,
but
some
courts
have
a
rule
that
judicial
notice
is
not
taken
of
ordinances.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
would
imagine
it
is,
i
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
think
the
problem
in
this
case
your
honor
is
the
fact
that
in
none
of
the
courts
below
was
there
any
attack
or
any
--
nobody,
nobody
considered
any
legislation,
nobody
focused
on
any
legislation
statute
or
ordinance
or
otherwise.
it
was
just
assumed
that
this
conduct
fell
within
some
legislative
provision.
i
mean
both
the
district
court
--.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
then
the
problem
is
what
you
mean
by
vagrancy.
some
--
most
the
articles
that
i
have
read
on
subject
include
loitering
type
offences
in
with
the
vagrancies,
but
it's
still
a
question
whether
or
not
you
are
going
to
--
if
you
want
to
separate
the
two
and
make
in
one
category
loitering
and
one
category
vagrancy,
i
suppose
you
can
do
that,
but
it's
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no
i
don't
think
it's
immaterial.
in
this
case
the
problem
is
that
the
issue
was
never
focused
and
brought
to
anybody's
attention
whether
they
were
charged
as
vagrants,
whether
they
were
charged
as
loiters
or
whether
they
were
charged
as
both
and
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
they
were
booked
for
vagrancy,
they
were
booked
for
vagrancy
and
as
i
tried
to
point
out
before,
if
there
wasn't
probable
cause
for
vagrancy,
the
state
vagrancy
statutes
since
it
has
common
elements
with
the
city
ordinance
such
as
visible
means
of
support,
loitering
and
it
would
be
--
certainly
wouldn't
be
an
unreasonable
construction
to
say
that
if
you
didn't
have
probable
cause
for
one
offence,
but
you
had
probable
cause
for
another
offence
which
contains
some
of
the
same
elements,
i
have
to
say
that
an
arrest
under
such
circumstances
is
unreasonable.
i
don't
--
to
me
that
seems
to
me
is
going
pretty
far.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
the
first
time
we
relied
on
the
loitering
ordinance
specifically
was
in
our
brief
on
the
merits
in
the
brief
in
opposition
here
is
all
we
said
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
in
this
court.
in
the
district
court,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
nobody
spelled
out
or
relied
on
any
particular
statute.
in
our
brief
in
opposition
was
the
first
time
anybody
brought
a
statute
into
this
case,
in
our
brief
and
opposition
we
said
three
men
had
been
loitering
in
the
public
street
for
five
hours.
they
were
unemployed
and
without
visible
means
of
support.
there
were
reasonable
grounds
for
the
police
officers
to
believe
in
good
faith
that
the
public
offence
of
vagrancy
kentucky
revised
statute
436520
was
being
committed
in
their
presence,
and
that's
what
we
said
and
that's
the
first
time
that
i
recall
that
anybody
brought
in
any
legislation
into
the
picture
in
any
court.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
they
were
immediately
booked
on
vagrancy
your
honor
and
15
minutes
later
the
--
after
they
were
brought
to
the
station,
15
minutes
after
the
arrest
their
car
was
searched.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes
then
the
concealed
weapons
charge
was
added
to
the
vagrancy
charge.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
of
course
suppose
you
have
a
situation
your
honor
where
you
have
a
statute
or
an
ordinance
which
forbid
loitering
in
a
dark
alley
at
night
and
a
woman
calls
the
police
and
says
there
is
a
man
lurking
in
the
alley
near
my
house
and
he
has
been
there
for
several
hours
and
the
police
come
on
the
scene
and
they
question
the
man
and
the
man
gives
them
evasive
answers,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
unreasonable
to
arrest
the
man
and
if
he
is
there
with
the
car
to
conduct
a
search
at
the
place
of
the
car
incidental
to
that
arrest
and
the
fact
that
there
is
only
a
$15
fine
for
loitering
in
a
dark
alley
to
me
it
seems
to
be
--
it
doesn't
make
the
search
unreasonable,
it
just
from
that
point
of
view
i
think
it's
reasonable
police
action.
it's
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
of
course,
it
depends
on
what
the
purpose
of
the
search
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
have
--
getting
back
the
man
from
the
dark
alley,
the
fact
that
you
can't
pinpoint
that
he
might
be
considering
burglarizing
the
place
in
the
vicinity
or
that
he
is
--
we
might
be
waiting
for
somebody
to
walk
down
the
street
to
mug
him.
it
seems
to
me
in
all
circumstances
an
arrest,
if
you
show
he
is
lurking
in
this
alley
and
he
has
no
reasonable
explanation
for
this
lurking,
i
don't
think
a
search
under
such
circumstances
would
be
an
unreasonable
search.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
we
don't
contend
that
any
time
you
arrest
somebody
for
loitering
that
you
can
conduct
an
incidental
search.
what
we're
saying
is
that
if
you
arrest
somebody
for
loitering
under
a
particular
statute,
and
if
the
circumstances
are
such
which
--
circumstance
in
which
he
is
loitering
are
such
to
cause
alarm
for
the
safety
of
persons
and
property
in
the
vicinity,
only
under
such
limited
circumstances
are
you
authorized
to
conduct
a
search,
in
other
words
if
the
police
cannot
go
out
and
just
make
a
general
round
up
of
people
on
the
theory
that
they
are
loitering
and
then
try
to
solve
some
crime.
we
think
the
reasonable
of
such
a
statute
is
illustrated
by
the
american
law
institute
model
penal
code.
they
have
a
provision
which
makes
some
an
offense
for
a
--
which
they
call
a
minor
offence,
a
violation,
it's
only
subject
to
fine,
if
a
person
loiters
or
prowls
in
a
place,
at
a
time
or
in
a
manner
not
usual
for
law
abiding
individuals,
under
circumstances
that
warrant
alarm
for
the
safety
of
persons
or
property
in
the
vicinity
and
then
they
--
unless
some
of
the
circumstances
which
might
warrant
alarm
and
they
put
this
proviso
and
unless
liked
by
the
actor
or
other
circumstances
is
impractical,
a
police
officer
shall
prior
any
arrest
or
an
offence
under
this
section
for
the
actor
an
opportunity
to
dispel
any
alarm
which
would
otherwise
be
warranted
by
requesting
him
to
identify
himself
and
explain
his
presence
of
conduct.
so
there
is
a
need
for
a
local
community
to
have
such
legislation.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
your
honor
what
we
say
in
the
brief
is
that
the
--
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
case,
the
vagrancy
statute
provides
that
you
have
to
habitually
either
loiter
or
do
the
various
acts
prescribed
in
this
vagrancy
statute.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
the
defendant
--
i
mean
that
the
petitioner,
the
other
two
defendants
had
loitered
on
any
other
occasion.
so
in
this
--
we
don't
know
how
kentucky
would
construe
this
legislation
and
in
the
absence
of
that
we
have
said
that
perhaps
it
would
be
reasonable
to
construe
it
as
to
loitering
on
several
occasions
and
for
that
reason
we
rely
on
the
ordinance
rather
than
the
vagrancy
statute.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no
we
don't.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
fact
that
these
men
report
there
from
10
p.m.
to
3
a.m.
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
in
the
first
place,
i
think
loitering
as
such
could
be
reasonably
be
construed
to
exclude
innocent
idling.
so
i
think
that
the
kentucky
courts
could
say
that
loitering
itself
means
loitering
for
a
purpose
somewhat
like
the
american
law
institute
has.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
of
course
i
think
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
they
were
in
an
automobile
is
a
fact
that
they
were
in
automobile
in
which
they
did
not
have
the
registration
papers
required
by
kentucky
law.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
don't
know
how
a
kentucky
court
would
construe
it,
but
i
would
think
that
that
when
you
have
--
that
under
the
ordinance
which
provides
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
not
having
a
legitimate
business
or
visible
means
of
support,
i
think
--
and
to
--
in
this
particular
manner
loiter
i
think
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
then
the
--
then
the
problem
really
boils
down
to
this,
of
course
i
think
the
kentucky
court
could
construe
it,
i
mean
it
maybe
a
strained
construction,
but
i
think
they
could
construe
it
in
a
manner
like
the
ali's
definition,
but
the
issue
really
is,
is
not
the
validity
--
whether
the
ordinance
would
sustain
a
conviction
or
the
issue
isn't
whether
--
the
issue
rather
is
whether
or
not
the
conduct
of
the
police
was
unreasonable.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
of
course
in
a
sense
--
in
a
sense
of,
a
police
officer
--
a
police
officer
is
authorized
to
make
an
arrest
when
he
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
certain
facts
constitute
an
offense.
whatever
the
difficulties
of
construing
this
ordinance
we
think
that
a
local
police
officer
had
probable
cause
to
act
under
that.
in
other
words,
it's
a
legal,
certainly
a
legal
problem.
lawyers
would
find
it
to
be
a
legal
problem,
but
i
don't
think
it
was
unreasonable
for
the
police
officer,
and
the
facts
to
act
under
this
act,
and
arrest
these
people,
and
the
circumstances
in
which
he
acted
and
i
think
that's
the
issue
whether
or
not
his
act
is
--
the
act
of
the
police
officers
arresting
this
men
was
reasonable,
whether
or
not
rather
--
than
whether
or
not
the
ordinance
was
--
would
constitutionally
sustain
a
conviction
and
in
the
sense
that
while
nobody
has
brought
the
ordinance
in
the
case
until
this
level,
certainly
a
police
officer
acting,
a
police
officer
not
only
would
--
unless
he
was
very
educated
police
officer
would
not
be
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
population
of
new
port
i
understand,
your
honor,
is
somewhere
above
cincinnati,
a
population
of
3000
people.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
this
car
was
parked
in
a
business
district,
near
a
night
club.
there
were
other
close
businesses
in
the
vicinity.
there
is
a
restaurant
a
block
and
a
half
away.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
apparently
the
restaurant
was
open
your
honor
–
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
--
and
the
night
club,
the
night
club
was
open
till
3
o'clock
as
the
record
indicates,
night
club
was
just
closing
apparently
at
the
time
the
police
went
out
to
arrest
these
people.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
they
–
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
the
excuse
they
gave
for
being
there?
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
they
said
--
they
were
hesitant
and
the
first
thing
the
police
said
why
are
you
there
and
they
said,
we
are
waiting
for
a
truck
driver
named
johnny
saxton,
who
--
and
so
the
police
queried
further
and
they
had
said
that
the
truck
driver
was
driving
from
lexington
to
new
port.
now
lexington,
i,
we've
put
in
the
brief
is
less
than
a
hundred
miles
away,
i
think
it's
actually
maybe
about
85
miles
away.
they
have
been
waiting
there
for
five
hours,
so
they
said,
what
kind
of
truck,
what
kind
of
truck
is
saxton
driving?
they
couldn't
give
any
explanation
to
that.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
what,
what
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
the
three
men
said
they
were
unemployed.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
they
had
25
cents
between
them.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
record
i
don't
think
indicates
who
had
the
25
cents.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
all
three
of
them--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
my
recollection
your
honor
is
they
all
claimed
that
they
are
unemployed
and
one
said
he
was
unemployed
for
a
period
of
up
to
six
months
and
they
didn't
claim
any,
in
my
recollection
any
means
of
support.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
he
--
that's
what's
they
said,
they
are
waiting
for
saxton
because
he
was,
so
he
was
going
to
get
them
a
job.
of
course
saxton
never
has
produced,
he
doesn't
testify
at
the
trial
and
if
they
are
waiting
for
saxton
there
for
five
hours--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
there
are
lights
--
the
description
of
the
lighting
i
don't
think
is
--
nobody
describes
how
lighted
the
streets
were,
i
am
sure
there
must
have
been
some
city
lights,
but
it
doesn't.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
don't,
my
recollection
is
that
the
lighting
in
the
streets
are
not
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
there
were
three
men
and
four
officers,
there
were
two
cars,
two
detectives
and
two
policemen.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
what
did
you
say?
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
three
men
in
the
other
car,
three
men
and
this
town
has
a
police
force,
according
to
fbi,
a
uniform
crime
reports
60,
60
or
61
police
and
police
employees,
total
police
force.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yeah.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
specifically
whether
or
not
you
could
just
search
the
automobile,
the
delayed
search
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yeah,
it
seems
to
me,
if
it
was
reasonable,
if
it
was
reasonable,
i
think
the
officers
acted
reasonably
in
arresting
them.
it
seems
to
me
reasonable
to
search,
to
go
in
the
car
and
search
the
car
15
minutes
later
and
not
--
rather
than
searching
the
car
on
the
street,
while
--
they
had
the
right
to
search
the
car
on
the
street,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
unreasonable
for
this,
for
these
officers
to
search
the
car
at
3
o'clock
in
the
winter
night,
they
have
three
men,
they
have
just
arrested
three
men,
it
doesn't
seem
to
unreasonable
for
them
to
search
the
car
at
the
police
station.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
men
were,
had
been
booked,
so
i
assume
that
they
were
locked
up?
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
car
was
in
the
police
station.
now
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
men
couldn't
get
to
the
car
as
long
as
they
were
still
incarcerated
and
i
don't
know
what
--
if
the
police
depended
--
the
problem
--
the
police
have
control
of
the
car
without
somebody
else
would
come
and
try
to
drive
away
i
don't
know.
i
would
think
it
seemed
to
me
though
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
the
record
is
clear
--
the
record
indicates
that
at,
they
arrested
him
at
this
on
the
street.
they
took
the
car;
one
police
officer
drove
the
car
to
the
police
station.
they
booked
the
man,
15
minutes
after
arrest
sykes,
the
driver
of
the
car
said
i
would
like
to
go
to
the
car
to
get
some
cigarettes.
at
this
point
one
of
the
detectives
and
two
of
the
men
went
down
to
the
car
by
themselves
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no
not
with,
no
apparently
without
sykes,
they
went
down
the
car
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
excuse
me
two
of
the
detective,
detective
and
two
of
the
other
police
officers
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
and
they
went
down
the
car
and
one
or
more
of
them
said
they
looked
on
the
seat
for
cigarettes,
they
looked
on
the
dashboard
for
cigarettes,
there
were
no
cigarettes
on
the
seat,
there
were
no
cigarettes
on
the
dashboard,
the
detective
pushed
opened
the
unlocked
glove
compartment
and
at
that
point
he
found
the
two
guns,
then
they
attempted
to
open
the
trunk,
i
think
at
that
point
but
they
were
unsuccessful,
so
they
went
back,
went
back
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
no
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yeah,
he
said
he
is
looking
for
cigarettes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
sykes
said
he
wanted
his
cigarettes,
but
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
he
didn't
testify
in
motion
of
this
press
your
honor
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
but
the
officer,
he
says
this
is
a
very
good
element,
he
testified
at
the
trial
but
not
on
motion
to
suppress.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
on
the
motion
to
suppress
--
on
the
motion
to
suppress,
the
only
witnesses
were
the
three
police
officers,
they
were
called
by
the
defense
counsel.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes
i
am
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
reason
we
didn't
argue
consent
because
the
officers
they,
were
is
so
nebulous
they
just
said
he
asked
for
the
cigarettes
and
then
the
officers
went
down
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
don't
think
you
can
equate
the
hotel
room
or
the
car.
i
think
that
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right
i
would
concede
it.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
the
difference
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
the
difference,
the
difference
is,
one,
that
the
car
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
offence
of
loitering.
so
you
have
the
problem
is,
is
that
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
no
but
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
as
i
understand,
it
seems
to
me
in
the
related
case
justice
brandeis
in
united
states
versus
lee
or
lee
versus
united
states
had
a
problem
of
the
seizure
of
a
boat
or
a
vessel
and
they
both
were
seized
and
it
seems
to
me
indicates
there
is
some,
i
may
not
be
exactly
clear,
there
are
some
statement
that
the
greater
includes
the
less,
in
another
words,
if
you
have
to
right
to
see
something
you
have
a
right
to
search
it.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
am
not
sir
--
united
states
versus
lee,
now
i
am
sort
of
vague
on
the
facts
but
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
it's
the
274
us,
its
–
(inaudible)
decided
for
the
proposition
when
something
is
in
plain
view
you
can,
you
have
a
right
to
seize
and
you
can
seize
it.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
as
i
said
to
justice
goldberg
i
think
it's
a
problem
of,
one,
this
ordinance
is
so
vague
on
its
phase
that
a
kentucky
court
could
not
construe
it
to
constitute
an
offence
and,
two,
that
the
issue
really,
issues
as
far
as
the
officers
are
concerned
is,
we
are
not
here
dealing
with
the
conviction
under
the
statute
or
under
the
ordinance
the
problem
is
whether
or
not
the
officers
or
police
officers
acted
arbitrarily.
did
they
unlawfully
invade
the
privacy
of
these
men?
it
certainly
isn't
the
function
of
the
police
to
construe
statutes
or
construe
ordinances.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
(inaudible)
no
i
think
that
basically
that
these
men
did
loitered
in
an
idle
dissolute
disreputable
way
and
the
problem
is
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
maybe
it's
maybe
not
dissolute
maybe
disreputable.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
i
would
say
that
the
disreputable
feature
of
the
conduct
is
remaining
there
under
circumstances
which
indicated
to
reasonable
policemen
that
they
were
a
menace
to
persons
and
property
in
the
vicinity.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
your
honor,
the
police,
when
the
police
came
upon
the
scene
they
did
not
know
that
this
car
belonged
to
these
men.
these
men
only,
these
men
were
all
said
they
were
all
are
unemployed.
they
didn't
have
any
registration
receipt
which
is
required
to
be
kept
in
the
car
at
all
times
under
kentucky
law.
so
the
indications
and
they
are
all
unemployed.
there
was
no
indication
that
they
said
they
bought
the
car
the
day
before,
there
was
no
indication
that
they
could
have,
the
police
could
reasonably
believe
that
they
have
this,
could
have
the
financial
condition
to
buy
such
a
car
even
if
the
car
is
worth
$400,
usually
even
a
loan
company
would
require
some
sort
of
a
security
or
at
least
that
you
are
employed
before
they
even
let
you
have
a
$400
car.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
of
course
that
is
possible,
the
--
no
question
as
far
as
nobody
developed
those
facts.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
i
don't
think
they
asked
him
whether
they
had
money
in
the
bank.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
well
it
seems
to
me,
it
seems
to
of
course
that
there
were
questions
asked
and
there
were
questions
not
asked.
and
of
course
the
police
could
have
asked
other
questions
and
of
course
other
questions
could
have
been
developed
and
the
motion
was
suppressed.
but
i
think
based
on
what
was
asked,
i
think
the
inference
is
that
they
didn't
have
any
funds,
sure
you
can
always
--
i
mean
you
could
have
asked,
somebody
could
have
asked
another
question,
but
i
think
upon
what
the
police
found
out,
i
think
if
it
was
reasonable
for
them
to
think
that
these
men
didn't
have
any
visible
means
of
support.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
i
would
think
if
they
had
waited
48
hours
the
search
would
be
unreasonable.
i
mean
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
i
think
it's
substantially
contemporaneous,
i
think
the
situation
is
substantially
contemporaneous.
i
mean
is
it
--
would
you
compare
two
situations,
which
is
more
reasonable?
i
mean
here
we
are
dealing
with
local
law
enforcement,
which
is
it
more
reasonable
for
a
local
law
enforcement
agency
when
they
have
a
situation
which
warrants
search
of
the
car,
search
the
car
at
the
scene
or
is
it
just
as
reasonable
for
them
rather
than
searching
the
car
at
the
scene,
take
the
car
and
search
it
at
the
police
garage
as
soon
as
--
practically
as
soon
as
they
get
to
the
police
garage.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
i
think
that's
a
more
difficult
query.
i
think
if
they
returned
to
the
car
just
after
they
locked
them
up,
maybe
there
wouldn't
be
any
significant
difference.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
what?
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
that's
right,
in
other
words,
then
the
problem
there
is,
where
or
not
they
are
not
having
seized
the
car,
not
having
seized
the
car
initially
that
they
could
go
back.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no
i
think
we
would
have
a
much
better
case
if
on
the
spot,
on
the
spot
they
made
a
searched
if
you
certainly
consider
it
from
a
point
of
view
of
weapons,
if
all
they
can
search
for
is
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
what?
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
no,
they
didn't
have
a
right
to
make
a
general
search,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
if
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
that's
not
--
well
certainly
if
one
reason,
one
reason
which
this
court
had
said
for,
and
an
important
reason
for
making
the
search
is
to
protect
the
officers
and
to
prevent
their
means
of
escape.
however
there
are
other
--
there
are
two
other
reasons
which
–
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
other
two
reasons
are
to
seize
the
instrumentalities
of
a
crime
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
you
are
arresting
one,
because
they
haven't
done
anything
and
two
you
are
arresting
them
because
you
think
they
are
about
to
do
something,
as
their
conduct
is
such.
assuming
we
had
a
situation
like
the
america
law
institute
has
envisioned
and
is
that
you
are
arresting
because
their
conduct
is
a
--
is
sort
of
like
--
is
a
menace
to
the
people,
in
other
words
instead
of
having
a
drawn
gun,
menacing
the
people
around
they
are
just
like
if
a
man
is
in
the
alley
he
is
constituting
some
sort
of
menace.
so
the
problem
is
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
in
other
words
obtain
a
search
warrant.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
of
course,
it
seems
to
me
if
you
have
a
case
where
it's
clear
that's
the
police
officers
can
search
not
only
for
weapons
to
--
suppose
you
have
a
situation
when
somebody
is
driving
a
car
and
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
the
car
contains
liquor,
and
as
carroll,
specific
carroll
type
of
situation,
the
police
officers
instead
of
searching
the
car
at
scene
take
the
car
with
the
man
to
the
police
garage
and
conduct
the
search.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
they
have
a
right
to
search
not
only
for
weapons
but
for
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
i
don't
think
--
i
think
you
are
loitering,
you
just
can't
look
at
loitering,
loitering
certainly
has
a
safety
factor
and
it's
true
that
this
court
has
said
that
generally
speaking
a
search
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
no
i
think
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
i
think
you
have
to
consider
the
loitering
in
relationship
to
the
circumstances
under
which
the
arrest
is
made
and
in
connection
with
--
if
the
circumstances
are
such
which
even
though
the
police
who
make
an
arrest
for
loitering
can't
pinpoint
that
the
man
is
about
to
break
into
a
house
or
about
to
grab
a
woman
off
the
street,
i
think
if
the
circumstances
are
such,
i
think
that
that
those
are
the
circumstances
that
you
have
a
right
to
make
the
same
type
arrest
as
you
have
in
a
normal
crime
situation
where
the
right
to
make
an
arrest
is
for
the
instrumentalities
and
fruits
of
that
particular
crime,
because
you
know
by
the
time
you
make
that
arrest
what
particular
crime
has
been
committed.
in
other
words,
what
you've
got
--
what
you
have
in
a
situation
is
you
have
a
problem
of
crime
prevention
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
not
unreasonable
if
the
circumstances
are
such
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
i
would
say
it
depend
on
the
circumstances,
circumstance
--
i
mean
if
you
just
had
a
situation
where
you
arrested
somebody
because
they
are
unemployed
and
---
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
(inaudible)
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
mean
the
circumstances
of
this
case
where
they
have
been
around
on
the
streets
of
newport
for
five
hours,
we
have
three
men
there
men
there
for
five
hours
where
the
give
the
police
an
evasive
and
false
explanation
where
there
is
a
likelihood,
the
reason
that
they
are
waiting
there
is
they
are
waiting
for
somebody
perhaps,
if
you
want
to
speculate
they
are
waiting
for
somebody
to
come
out
of
night
club
who
they
can
rob
or
mug
it's
--
and
their
conduct
really,
their
loitering
is
closely
related
to
other
offences,
but
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
yes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
of
course
i
don't
know
whether
you
know,
first
place
you
don't
start
off
with
a
search
of
the
entire
car,
the
search
becomes
initially
what
they
do
is
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yeah
that's
a
more
difficult
case,
the
more
difficult
case,
but
this
case
isn't
that
--
i
don't
know,
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
in
this
case
the
problem
is
was
it
reasonable
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
for
the
police
to
look
in
the
glove
compartment
of
an
automobile
when
the
men
said
that
they
bought
the
car
the
day
before,
they
had,
they
are
unemployed
and
they
didn't
have
any
registration
receipt
or
any
bill
of
sale
indicating
that
they
had
purchased
the
car.
it
seems
to
me
not
unreasonable
for
the
police
to
look
in
the
glove
compartment
for
example,
tell
them
whether
there
is
any
indication
of
who
the
owner
of
the
car
is
in
the
glove
compartment.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
assuming
that
they
have
a
right
to
hold
the
car
and
that
somebody,
that
sykes's
wife
couldn't
come
up
to
the
police
station
and
drive
the
car
away,
assuming
that
somebody,
in
other
words
this
is
my
car,
sykes's
wife
who
turned
out
was
the
actual
owner
the
car,
assuming
that
sykes
was
arrested
like
he
was
here
and
he
asked
to
make
a
phone
call
and
he
telephones
his
wife,
this
is
3'o
clock
in
the
morning,
his
wife
comes
and
says
i
want
my
car.
now,
you
still
have
a
problem,
the
police
have
a
right
to
hold
that
car
at
that
point
or
they
have
to
release,
the
police
say
well,
we
are
not
going
to
release
the
car
we're
applying
for
search
warrant.
i
don't
know
in
other
words,
if
they
have
a
right
to
hold
the
car,
they
have
a
right
to
hold
the
car
and
apply
for
a
search
warrant
against
anybody
who
wants
to
take
the
car
then
i
see
no
determent
in
applying
for
search
warrant,
but
if
they
don't
have
the
right
to
hold
the
car
and
somebody
like
mrs.
sykes
can
come
and
drive
it
away
and
then
i
say
there
is
a
determent
to.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
our
argument
is
that
they
had
a
right
to
search
the
car
and
they
had
the
right
to
hold
the
car
but
in
response
to
your
question,
your
question
was,
should
they
have
gotten
--
should
they
have
gone
and
obtained
a
search
warrant.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
they
wouldn't
suffer
providing
they
are
holding
the
impounding
of
the
car
if
they,
they
had
a
legal
right
to
hold
the
car,
they
wouldn't
suffer.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
the
only
thing
that
bothers
me
in
a
situation,
suppose
is
it
more
inconvenient
for
a
citizen
to
have
his
receipts
base,
is
just
more
inconvenience
to
him
to
have
his
car
seized
and
taken
into
the
custody
and
impound
it
for
a
period
of
time
or
is
it
more
inconvenient
for
him
to
have
the
search,
car
searched
and
then
released.
no,
i
don't
mean
--
what
i
want
i'm
trying
to
say
is,
if
you
look
from
a
point
of
view,
suppose
you
had
an
ordinary
citizen
and
he
is
arrested
under
suspicious
circumstance,
he
doesn't
have
his
title
papers
of
car
and
the
police
wanted
to
conduct
an
examination,
they
want
to
examine
the
car
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
is
his
car,
they
can't
readily
conduct
it
any
other
way.
so
i
don't
know
whether
it's
--
it
would
be
more
--
if
a
state,
if
the
state
says,
we
will
authorize
the
search
of
the
glove
compartment
to
see
whether
or
not
there
is
anything
in
the
glove
compartment
which
is
to
substantiate
his
ownership
and
then
let
him
go
on
his
way,
which
is
more
of
an
invasion,
is
it
more
of
an
invasion
to
have
the
--
to
permit
a
limited
search
of
the
car,
or
is
it
more
of
an
invasion
to
seize
and
impound
the
car?
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes
that
would,
it
seem
to
me
if
there
is
a
substantial
time
in
the
lapse
and
there
is
certainly
absolutely
no
--
there
is
no
time,
there
is
no
time
of
the
essence
problem
there,
they
can
use
the
lapsed
time
to
obtain
a
search
warrant.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
situation
where
you
have
an
arrest,
booking
of
the
search,
it's
sort
of
one
contemporary
--
contemporaneous
operation,
there
is
no
lapse
of
time,
i
mean
it
just
--
if
it's
a
law
it
certainly
is
a
question
of
a
degree,
but
i
think
as
far
as
this
is
concerned
i
think
the
degree
is
that
is
part
of
one
transaction.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
of
course,
speculate
as
to
what
you
know
i
mean
you
can't
say
what's
in
the
glove
compartment.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
in
fact
it
may
in
that
sense,
if
there
was
--
this
is,
this
was
part
of
a
larger
crime
it
may
have
enabled
the
police
to
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
they
didn't
approach
that.
just
a
word
on
this
problem
of
two
lawyers
as
our
brief
points
out,
this
wasn't
raised
at
any
stage
of
the
case
and
i
think
in
the
trial
of
any
case,
of
any
case
whether
several
defendants,
no
one
can
say
whether
you
have
paid
or
appoint
counsel
by
hindsight
what's
the
better
course.
this
court
knows
in
many
cases
where
the
lawyers
were
not
appointed,
defendants
choose,
defendants
choose
to
have
a
joint
counsel
and
sometimes
you
are
much
better
off
with
joint
counsel
at
least
with
joint
counsel
you
don't
have
one
lawyer
pulling
in
one
direction
and
another
lawyer
pulling
in
another
direction
and
that
in
this
situation
where
the
trial
lawyer
who
talked
to
these
individuals
didn't
see
anything
in
their
circumstances
to
one
separate
counsel,
i
don't
think
that
you
can
say
that
as
a
matter
of
law
certainly
when
this
is
raised
below
--
last
stage
is
that
they
should
have
a
separate
counsel.
