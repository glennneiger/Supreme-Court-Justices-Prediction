justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
that
there
was
consent
for
the
searching?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
i
would
like
to
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
gather
if
you
are
not
suggesting
consent
then
in
fact
sykes
asked
for
cigarette
is
quite
irrelevant
we
may
treat
the
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
having
the
three
men
incarcerating
the
officers
went
down
15
minutes
later
and
searched
the
car.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
would,
suppose
the
only
change
we
have
in
factor
was
that
when
they
searched
the
three
of
--
the
persons
that
were
three,
they
found
a
hotel
room
key
and
the
officers
have
done
then
what
they
did
do
with
the
car.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
have
taken
the
key
down
to
the
hotel
room
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
can
concede
that
that
would
be
an
invalid
search.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yeah,
here
you
have
the
three
defendants
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incarcerated
and
the
car
available
at
police
seizure.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
need,
did
you
need
the
car
to
prove
the
defense
in
loitering
into
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
should
think
that
when
rather
argue
against
you
there
are
no
visible
means
to
support
it,
they
had
the
car.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
familiar
with
the
case
your
honor.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
they
searched
15
minutes
after
they
had
locked
them
up,
the
police
had
waited
48
hours
to
do
it?
