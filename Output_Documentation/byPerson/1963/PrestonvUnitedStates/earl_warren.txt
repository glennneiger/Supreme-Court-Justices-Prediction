163,
john
brenton
preston,
petitioner,
versus
united
states.
mr.
shea.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
glazer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
the
federal
courts
take
judicial
notice
of
city
ordinances?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
rule
in
these
courts,
federal
courts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
general
rule?
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
it
was
argued
many
times
in
this
court
in
other
context
that
defendant
can't
use
it
when
he
comes
to
this
court
because
he
hadn't
specially
pleaded
it
in
the
courts
below
that
because
courts
did
not
take
judicial
notice
of
city
ordinances
and
i
wonder
how
you
could
go
all
the
way
from
the
district
court
up
to
this
court
and
not
plead
the
ordinance
in
any
way
and
then
ask
a
state
judicial
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
vagrancies,
on
vagrancy
provision,
wouldn't
that
be
more
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
it's
immaterial
when
you
charge
a
man
with
vagrancy
whether
it's
under
a
state
statute
or
whether
it's
under
city
ordinance
to
charge
this
entitled
loitering?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
they
at
any
place
booked
for
--
booked
or
charged
for
loitering?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
did
you
first
rely
on
the
loitering
ordinance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
this
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
the
ordinance,
do
you
abandon
your
reliance
on
the
vagrancy
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
ask
us
to
sustain
on
the
federal
--
on
the
state
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
for
probable
cause,
the
officers
must
have
found
that
they
had
loitered
in
an
idle
or
a
dissolute,
or
a
disreputable,
or
a
loafing
way
in
order
to
give
them
reasonable
grounds,
must
they
not?
now
which
one
of
those
do
they
come
under?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
mean
if
they
done
none
of
these
things,
do
you
mean
if
they
had
not
loitered
in
either
an
idle
or
dissolute
or
a
disreputable
or
loafing
way
that
the
police
could
still
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
there
in
relation
to
being
dissolute,
what
was
about
their
conduct
that
was
dissolute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
about
their
conduct
was
disreputable?
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
the
lighted
street
in
their
own,
in
their
own
car
that
apparently
no
objection
haven't
been
made
to
the
use
of
the
car,
no
claim
that
the
car
was
stolen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
know
they
didn't
use
their
last
dollar
to
pay
for
the
car?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
know
that
they
didn't
have
in
the
bank?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
own
property,
wouldn't
that,
wouldn't
that
disapprove
the
idea
of
being
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
arrested
for
being
idle,
there
are
lot
of
people
loitering
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
commandeered
the
car
and
having
driven
it
to
the
police
station
and
parked
it
in
a
lot,
and
having
charged
men
with
vagrancy
and
locked
them
up
in
jail,
what
would
have
been
the
determent
to
the
police
other
than
inconvenience
for
them
to
have
gone
a
to
a
magistrate
and
gotten
a
search
warrant
for
that
car.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
started
arguing
yourself
out
of
court,
if
you
say
if
they
didn't
have
a
right
to
hold
the
car
but
they
still
have
a
right
to
search
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
just
asked
you,
how
the
police
would
suffer
other
than
through
the
inconvenience
of
going
to
a
magistrate
and
asking
for
a
warrant,
would
they
suffer
in
any
other
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
wouldn't
those
facts
lead
us
into,
to
say
that
they
should
have
gotten
the
warrant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
can't
say
here
very
well
that
they
were
just
searching
at
that
compartment
to
see
if
everything
was
all
right
and
then
let
him
go
on
their
way,
because
you
had
already
booked
him
and
put
him
in
jail
or
put
all
these
men
in
jail.
so,
if
you
had
done
that
perhaps
at
the
scene
of
the
arrest,
it
might
have
been
one
thing,
but
here
you
have
closed
that
door.
you
have
taken
his
car
in
possession,
the
police
officer
drove
it
from
the
city
street
where
it
had
a
right
to
be
down
to
the
police
department,
put
it
in
the
lot,
put
them
in
jail
and
lock
them
up
and
then
after
that
they
go
and
search
the
car.
now
i
understood
you
did
say
in
response
to
mr.
justice
clark's
question
that
if
there
had
been
a
substantial
period
of
time
elapsed
between
the
time
that
they
put
these
men
in
jail
and
the
time
they
went
down
to
search
the
car
that
if
they
would
of
necessity
have
to
have
the
search
warrant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
you
draw
those
limits?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
shea
before
you
sit
down
i
would
like
to
take
this
opportunity
on
behalf
of
the
court
to
thank
you
for
your
service
in
the
case.
it
is
a
public
service
and
the
court
is
always
comforted
by
the
fact
that
busy
lawyer
like
yourself
are
willing
to
undertake
it
for
the
public
service,
the
defense
of
indigent
defendants.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
thank
you
very
much
and
mr.
glazer
we
thank
you
for
the
earnest
and
diligent
manner
which
you
represented
the
government.
we
will
recess
now.
