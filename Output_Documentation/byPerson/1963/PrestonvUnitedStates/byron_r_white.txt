car
and
then
when
they
--
in
the
case
vagrancy,
you
don't
suspect
them
of
doing
anything
but
loitering
as
justice
black
says,
or
if
you're
really
left
with
just
the
safety
factor?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
that
you
can
arrest
someone
for
loitering
and
automatically
you
are
entitled
to
suspect
that
he
is
going
to
commit
a
crime?
justice
byron
r.

some
other
crime?

(inaudible)
have
any
events
for
vagrancy
automatically
means
that
somebody
is
about
to
commit
a
crime,
at
least
it
means
enough
that
you
could
search
his
car,
if
you
have
to
arrest
him
in
his
car.
justice
byron
r.

well
because
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
loitering
as
you
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
would
have
had
perfectly
a
good
reason
to
search
the
car
at
the,
right
where
they
arrested
the
men,
where
they
have
been
sitting
for
five
hours,
for
reasons
other
than
their
personal
safety.
justice
byron

white
and
that
those
reasons
were
perfectly
sufficient
to
search
the
entire
car
and
if
they
survive
taking
car
to
the
police
station.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
but
you
didn't
say
they
could,
i
mean
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
okay,
oh
yes.
justice
byron

white
to
look
and
search
the
car.
