what

it
appeared
to
me
that
the
court
could
get
avoid
the
doubts
of
justice
goldberg
if
they
adopted
mr.
shea's
doubts
as
to
the
search
of
the
automobile,
what
is
your
answer
to
that?

here
the

the
place
that
they
selected.
they
parked
it
in
the
way
in
which
they
decided
to
park
it
and
to
me,
they
control
of
it.
so
what
harm
could
have
done,
what
danger
was
there,
they
had
gone
over
to
get
the
search
warrant,
rather
than
going
down
there
without
a
search
warrant.

taken
these

locked
them
up

returned
to
