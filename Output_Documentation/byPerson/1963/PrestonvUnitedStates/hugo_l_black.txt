l.
black
and
â€“
justice
hugo
l.

excuse
did

justice

black

about
the
night
club
or
the
restaurant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah
what
reason
did
they
give?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
could
say
whether
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
say
whether
or
not
they
had
a
job?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
have
any
money?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
had
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
one
of
the
charges
in
the
--
in
loitering.
what
they
are
doing,
whether
they
have
a
job--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
don't
have
any
mean
to
support,
did
they
claim
they
had
any
mean
to
support?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
the
--
mr.
shea
said
that
that
they
were
waiting
for
saxton,
because
he
was
going
to
get
them
a
job.
justice

justice
hugo
l.
black
he
didn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
didn't
testify
anything
about
this.
no
issue
came
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
and
found
these
three
people
there
that
time
of
night,
information
has
been
all
these
hours,
that
they
had
a
right
to
say,
one
of
you
(inaudible)
and
i
would
suppose
to
main
grounds
would
be
and
seem
to
me
a
pretty
good
ground,
because
the
policeman
didn't
want
their
lives
endangered
by
people
who
were
there
had
no
money,
loafing
there
for
five
hours,
but
you
get
a
clear
way
from
that
when
they
moved
that
car
out,
go
to
the
police
station
and
the
police
people
are
safe.
they
were
not
in
any
danger
then
from
anything
that
is
in
the
car.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
they
only
had
a
right
to
do
it
from
the
point
of
safety
didn't
they,
the
didn't
have
the
right
to
go
make
a
general
search
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
think
myself
that
under
those
circumstances
i'd
find
it
hard
to
say
a
policemen
couldn't
protect
his
life
from
people
he
didn't
know,
search
a
car
to
see
if
there
are
any
weapons,
under
those
circumstances,
but
it's
quite
different
when
that
car
is
taken
away
and
the
policeman
are
no
longer
in
any
possible
danger.
there
are
cases
all
the
time
where
officers
are
hurt
by
the
people
that
they
arrest
night
or
some
other
time,
it's
the
only
thing
that
could
be
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
they
are
being
hurt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
the
reasons?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
wouldn't
have
any
instrumentality
of
the
crime
of
loitering
that
i
can
think
of
vagrancy
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
(inaudible)
because
they
haven't
done
anything,
not
because
they
have
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
the
time
to
do
that
would
be
then,
you'd
certainly
have
ample
time
to
follow
the
order
and
the
processes
of
the
law
when
you
took
the
car.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
your
idea,
your
argument
that
when
people
are
found
in
some
places
like
stalking
(inaudible)
in
an
alley
behind
somebody's
home,
something
of
that
kind
or
behind
a
store,
where
there
are
windows
that
they
can
break
through
or
you
might
think
they
are
doing
something
certainly
that
time
of
night.
but
if
they
get
the
car
and
take
it
off,
it
seems
to
me
like
they
got
all
the
time
in
the
world,
they
had
(inaudible)
in
one
case,
that
something
about,
you
don't
have
to
get
the
search
warrant
at
least,
but
under
other
circumstances
they
do
have
to
get
it.
seems
to
me
like
your
weakness,
main
weakness
in
your
case
is
the
fact
that
they
took
it
back
up
to
this
place
and
probably
kept
there
waiting
and
they
just
decided
they
wanted
to
look
and
see
if
they
could
find
something,
they
didn't
know
what.
