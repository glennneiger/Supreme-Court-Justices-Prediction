mr.
mallory
e.
horne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
behalf
of
the
milk
commission,
i
will
address
myself
primarily
to
the
two
points.
one
the
involvement
of
the
military
milk,
the
other
with
the
regulatory
fee
imposed
by
state
and
reserve
to
mr.
savary,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
of
the
involvement
of
commerce.
i
think
first
of
all
the
brief
explanation
of
the
florida's
approach
to
the
military
milk
question
and
particularly
with
the
reference
to
this
area
might
be
helpful.
first
of
all,
as
this
case
begin
its
development
even
prior
to
the
complaint
and
in
responding
to
your
question,
the
record
does
reflect
the
vociferous
opposition
of
this
plaintiff
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
the
record
reflects
that
as
a
result
of
--
and
by
the
way
your
honor
that
he
does
not
load
himself
because
he's
a
distributor,
producers
and
producer-distributors
do
load.
after
series
of
letters
to
his
producers
against
after
they
succeeded
in
loading
in
this
jurisdiction,
this
record
reflects
a
series
of
unilateral
price
slash-in
to
the
producers
directed
to
this
plant
unparallel
in
our
history
of
milk
in
the
state.
so
the
answer
is
very
definitely,
he
was
opposed
and
from
that
time
on
this
case
begin.
now,
what
its
involvement
in
military
milk?
i
think
one
significant
thing.
the
complaint
which
brought
forth
to
jurisdiction
of
this
three-judge
tribunal,
one
alleged
primarily
that
the
military
milk
order,
effective
in
the
pensacola
market
precluded
his
utilization
of
other
state
milk.
and
jurisdiction
in
that
point
brought
forth,
the
three-judge
tribunal
going
up.
now,
before
we
can
even
get
the
pre-trial
conference,
the
producers
brought
it
out
as
they
can
in
our
statutory
structure,
the
military
milk
order.
so
that
at
the
time
of
the
pre-trial
conference,
may
it
please
the
court,
there
was
no
statutory
or
regulation
or
attempted
enforcement
in
the
field
of
military
milk
at
all,
none.
so
that
judge
caldwell
in
his
pre-trial
order
says
that
we
are
in
effect
true
with
the
military
milk
question,
it
has
become
moot.
and
there
was
an
order
into
that
effect
in
the
reference
and
it
is
noted
in
my
brief.
mr.
mallory
e.
horne
sir?
mr.
mallory
e.
horne
yes
sir.
mr.
mallory
e.
horne
yes
sir,
yes
sir
but
the
point
--
mr.
mallory
e.
horne
yes
sir.
but
the
point
is
that
he
cannot
--
let
me
--
this
brings
over
to
this
field
of
classification
of
milk
judge
and
here's
the
point.
and
that
is
that
we
have
classifications
of
milk.
class
i
is
generally
that
which
is
utilized
in
a
drinking
form
by
customers.
now,
military
milk
itself
would
fit
that
classification.
but
because
of
the
necessity
of
bidding,
if
they
want
use
it,
there
is
a
classification,
a
separate
classification
called
military
milk
and
a
separate
price.
in
most
areas
when
they
do
have
a
military
price,
if
someone
that
they
go
to
41
to
45
cents.
now,
the
military
classification
was
removed
in
florida
prior
to
this
trial.
so
what
he's
doing
here
is
saying
at
the
time
of
this
trial,
they
get
it
back
in
the
backdoor
and
saying,
“but
what
if
we
wanted
to
use
florida
milk
in
this
area
since
there
is
no
classification
of
it?”
and
the
--
he's
involved
here
is
because
of
this.
he
can
do
two
things
if
he
wants
to
use
florida
milk
but
be
mindful
that
it
came
into
court
because
it
was
keeping
him
from
using
other
state
milk
that
he
can
acquire.
and
this
gentleman
testified
in
court
that
if
he
never
saw
of
another
florida
producer,
the
milk
man
would
not
miss
one
delivery.
that's
how
significant
this
matter
is
to
him.
he
didn't
need
a
florida
producer
and
in
fact
over
70%
of
his
businesses,
milk
is
obtained
elsewhere.
but
he
can
obtain
florida
milk
on
a
bilateral
arrangement
with
producers
to
obtain
that
milk.
he
cannot
unilaterally
say
it.
but
he
get
it
from
other
surplus
areas
of
the
state,
if
he
can
persuades
his
own
producers
or
other
producers
to
produce
more
than
their
commitment
and
allocate
it
to
military
relationships
bilaterally
--
mr.
mallory
e.
horne
actually,
no.
i'm
not
saying
exactly
judge.
i
don't
want
to
mislead
you
about
this.
mr.
mallory
e.
horne
the
milk
that
he's
obtaining
from
his
base
earned
producers.
if
it
used
in
class
i
channel
and
military
actually
without
a
separate
definition
of
military,
it
would
be
class
i.
however
--
so
if
he
did
but
now
what
he's
telling
you
is
that
i
want
to
use
this
milk,
florida
milk.
but
at
the
same
time
in
his
testimony,
he
tells
you
that
when
wisconsin
is
in
surplus,
he
can
go
through
brokers
and
bring
milk
back
in
florida
for
30
cents.
mr.
mallory
e.
horne
unless
he
can
obtain
a
bilateral
agreement
elsewhere
in
florida
or
even
in
his
own
area
for
the
production
of
separate
milk.
mr.
mallory
e.
horne
no.
mr.
mallory
e.
horne
no
i'm
saying
that
if
he
wants
to
go
another
producer
or
at
a
dairy
farm
and
asked
them
to
produce
milk
for
him
for
dairy,
41
cents.
he
can
do
that
and
we
--
mr.
mallory
e.
horne
yes,
sir.
that's
right.
mr.
mallory
e.
horne
yes.
mr.
mallory
e.
horne
yes
but
we
do
not
try
the
make
him
use
it,
is
the
point.
how
can
we
encroach
and
how
can
we
be
construed
to
be
interfering
with
the
government
contract
when
we
do
nothing
in
the
area?
it's
difficult
for
me
to
understand
what
the
court
would
strike
down
if
you
struck
down
our
involvement
because
we
simply
do
nothing,
if
he
selects
this
milk.
mr.
mallory
e.
horne
yes,
sir.
i
am
--
i
am
suggesting
that
he
paid
61
before
the
milk
commission
even
came
in.
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
and
record
reflects
that
he
paid
his
producers
the
same
ones
you're
using
now,
61
cents
per
gallon
on
a
blend
based
prices.
mr.
mallory
e.
horne
yes
sir.
mr.
mallory
e.
horne
that's
my
understanding
of
it.
it
never
has
and
never
will
because
in
every
area
of
this
country
and
this
is
one
the
things
that's
causing
the
milk
industry
to
be
in
a
metamorphosis
from
actually
this
concept
of
locally
supplied
milk
to
the
big
brokerage
surplus-storage
type
situation.
and
that's
why
you
beginning
to
see
more
and
more
of
this
type
of
case.
but
in
anyway,
florida
commission
is
doing
absolutely
nothing.
they
tried
to
say
that
the
polar
case
says,
“as
i
understand
what
you
said.
there
is
ridiculous
because
there,
you
have
the
state
of
california
saying
that
x
number
of
cents
per
gallon,
you
must
charge.”
this
involved
the
direct
relationship
between
the
distributor
and
the
military
installation.
mr.
mallory
e.
horne
i
don't
think
it
is.
i
don't
think
it
ever
will
be
difficult
for
him
to
buy
out-of-state
milk.
it
never
has
been
a
problem.
it
isn't
one
now.
mr.
mallory
e.
horne
no
sir
it
won't
be.
mr.
mallory
e.
horne
no
i
think
he
is
absolutely
and
unequivocally
convinced
that
he
wants
to
destroy
the
florida
milk
commission.
i
think
it's
his
one
ambition
in
life
and
i
think
he
says
so.
but
the
military
question
is
ridiculous.
we
did
not
set
a
price
at
either
level
and
the
polar
case
attacked
that
one
point.
and
to
say
that
you
said
in
the
polar
case
that
you're
prohibiting
any
involvement
or
any
expenditure
that
affects
a
military
price
is
ridiculous
too
and
yet
that's
what
they
said
in
their
reply
brief
to
you.
mr.
mallory
e.
horne
yes
sir.
mr.
mallory
e.
horne
i
cannot
explain
it
judge.
i
can't
understand
why
we
are
arguing
it
here.
the
court
there
said,
“it's
moot
because
we
abolished
our
order
and
yet
the
biggest
part
of
the
transcript
in
this
case
involved
a
military
installation.”
and
we
argued
it
again
in
this
brief.
i
cannot
understand
it
because
it
in
fact
judge
had
become
moot.
mr.
mallory
e.
horne
by
reason
of
the
destruction
of
the
military
milk
order.
so
that
there
was
no
compulsion
that
he
buy
milk
from
florida
producers
at
any
specific
price
or
that
he
sells
to
the
military
installations
at
any
particular
price
in
fact
we
took
a
hands-off
policy.
mr.
mallory
e.
horne
yes,
sir.
that's
the
status
of
the
present
time.
now
with
respect
to
the
regulatory
fee
involved
here
and
i
--
i
can't
see
that
it
violates
a
single
standard
that
you
ever
set
forth
with
respect
to
a
state
rights,
states
right
to
have
a
regulatory
body
hence
sufficient
financially
to
accomplish
that
aspect
to
this
jurisdiction.
this
statute
simply
says
this,
that
the
producers
and
the
distributors
play
identically
the
same
fractional
percentage
of
each
gallon
of
milk
produced
on
the
one
hand
or
distributed
on
the
other
for
the
financing
of
this
commission.
that
fee
never
touches
the
general
revenue
fund
of
the
state
of
florida.
it
is
never
expended
in
any
function
of
our
government,
save
this
florida
milk
commission.
it
is
held
by
the
state
controller
in
trust
and
separate
from
all
other
general
revenue
funds
and
it
ever
exceeds
125%
of
the
budgeted
needs
of
florida
milk
commission
in
a
base
for
the
rest
of
that
year.
there
was
no
testimony
in
this
record
whatsoever
that
this
fee
was
one
excessive.
it
was
applied
to
this
distributor
differently
than
any
other
distributor,
nor
that
it
ever
touched
in
any
way
the
general
revenue
fund
of
the
state
of
florida.
it's
difficult
for
me
to
see
how
any
regulatory
fee
could
one
be
fairer
or
two,
fail
to
meet
the
standards
set
down
by
this
court
to
compare
to
the
standard
oil
case
is
absorbed,
the
gasoline
taxes
of
this
country
either
go
directly
to
the
general
revenue
funds
at
several
states
or
they
are
earmarked
constitutionally
or
statutorily
for
roads
and
this
is
not
the
specific
case
here.
so
i
think
that
the
question
of
the
involvement
of
the
military
in
either
of
its
aspects
is
not
justified
and
that
the
position
of
the
state
of
florida
in
both
regards
is
fair
and
meet
standard
set
fort
by
this
court.
thank
you
very
much.
