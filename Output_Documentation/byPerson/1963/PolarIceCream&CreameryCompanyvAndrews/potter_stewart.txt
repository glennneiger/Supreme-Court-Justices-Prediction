commission
or?
justice

stewart
of
those

counties.
justice

under
the
state
setup,
that's
on
(voice
overlap)
--
justice

but
--
am
i
right
in
my
understanding
that
with
respect
to
milk
which
is
to
be
sold
to
the
military,
the
military
installation,
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
--
that
the
--
that
polar
first
exhaust
the
class
i
supply
in
the
four-county
area,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there's
no
requirement
that
you
use
any
florida
milk?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
order
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
have
to
exhaust
the
--
the
four-county
supply.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
us
the
four-county
law?
justice
potter
stewart
--
but
there's
no
requirement
of
any
kind
to
do
so?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
conceived
that's
correct,
don't
you?
we
will
understand
the
case.
justice
potter
stewart
right
(inaudible).
thank
you.
