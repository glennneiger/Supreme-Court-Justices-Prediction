justice
william
o.
douglas
on
page
75
of
the
record
that
the
court
says
that
this
issue
would
become
moot.
justice
william
o.
douglas
could
you
explain
that
again?
justice
william
o.
douglas
by
reason
of?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
the
status
of
the
present
time?
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
you
look
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
at
the
record
at
page
186
a
minute
and
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
have
you
construct
me
out?
near
the
--
near
the
middle
of
the
page,
the
court
said
--
the
district
court
in
this
case,
"the
defendant
does
not
attempt
to
regulate
the
price
that
plaintiff
pays
his
out-of-state
producer
nor
do
the
regulations
restrict
plaintiff
from
purchasing
out-of-state
milk
in
any
amount
or
for
any
price."
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
not
if
not
--
not
for
using
this
class
i
category
though,
is
he?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that's
a
qualification
then
from
what
the
court
says
here.
justice
william
o.
douglas
nor
do
the
regulations
restrict
plaintiff
from
purchasing
out-of-state
milk
in
any
amount
or
for
any
price,
but
that
isn't
consistent
of
what
you
said
other,
is
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
then
why
isn't
this
governed
by
the
baldwin
and
seelig
case
insofar
as
class
i
is
concerned?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
the
state
of
vermont.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that's
just
a
--
a
variation
of
this
theme
of
this
case.
you
can't
sell
it
as
long
as
out-state
milk
in
class
i
as
long
as
there's
a
local
supply.
