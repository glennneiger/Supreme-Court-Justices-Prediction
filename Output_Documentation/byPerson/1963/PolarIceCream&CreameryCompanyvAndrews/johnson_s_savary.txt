mr.
johnson
s.
savary
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
address
my
remarks
mainly
to
the
commerce
question
that
has
been
brought
up
by
the
appellant
in
this
case.
but
before
doing
so,
i
believe
that
it
will
be
of
assistant
to
this
court
and
analyzing
the
facts
in
this
case,
and
this
case
to
understand
a
little
bit
more
about
the
milk
biddings
in
the
state
of
florida.
now
very
briefly,
there
are
five
milk
marketing
areas
in
the
state
of
florida
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
florida
milk
commission.
we
are
concerned
in
this
case
only
with
the
pensacola
area.
but
very
briefly,
we
have
the
tallahassee
area,
the
northeast
area
which
is
jacksonville,
the
central
florida
and
the
tampa
area.
now,
this
so-called
scheme
that
the
appellant
accuses
the
commission
of
adopting
is
the
same
scheme
used
in
every
other
area
in
the
state
of
florida.
in
other
words,
we
have
a
uniform
system
of
milk
regulation
in
each
of
the
five
milk
marketing
areas.
now,
i
should
point
out
to
the
court
to
this
61
cent
price
has
--
since
the
trial
on
this
case
been
dropped
to
59
cents
in
the
pensacola
area.
it
is
also
59
cents
in
the
tallahassee
area
but
it
is
61
cents
in
the
other
three
areas.
so
in
effect
the
tallahassee
and
pensacola
area
has
a
lower
class
i
price
in
the
other
areas
in
florida.
now,
the
base
order
or
base
scheme
as
referred
to
by
appellant
is
as
i
said
a
uniform
order
but
designating
each
milk
marketing
area
but
the
same
intent,
the
same
construction,
the
same
meaning
as
in
this
order,
as
an
area
order
in
the
state
of
florida.
now,
the
pensacola
area
was
under
the
control
of
the
florida
milk
commission
until
in
april
of
1958
which
timely
produces
loaded
the
commission
now
or
a
period
of
approximately
four
years,
the
commission
was
out
of
this
area.
the
producers
ordered
them
back
in
once
again
in
november
21,
1961.
following
this
point,
the
polar
ice
cream
company,
the
appellant
in
this
case
arbitrarily
cut
prices
to
his
producers.
he
cut
it
from
--
from
61
cents
that
he
was
paying
prior
to
the
time
this
commission
came
back
in
to
56
cents
retroactive
prior
to
the
date
the
commission
came
back
in.
it
further
cut
in
month
later
down
to
47
cents,
i
believe
in
on
that
to
43
cents
per
gallon.
following
this
unilateral
price
cutting
on
the
part
of
appellant,
the
commission
in
due
course
exercise
its
authority
on
the
statute
and
issued
a
letter
to
appellant
stating
that
the
producers
that
when
your
plant
prior
to
the
time
the
milk
commission
came
back
in
are
the
producers
that
are
assigned
basis
in
your
plant
based
on
the
previous
course
of
needs.
now,
we
are
dealing
merely
with
a
local
problem
that
pensacola,
the
same
problem
we
have
in
every
other
milk
marketing
area
in
florida.
when
the
commission
goes
in,
the
commission
must
assign
basis
to
a
plant
for
a
price
order
is
nothing
without
a
base
order.
you
can
say
that
price
order
is
50
cents
a
gallon
for
class
i
milk
or
60
or
59,
but
unless
you
have
a
base
order,
and
unless
the
producer
and
the
distributor
know
what
milk
goes
in
or
what
category,
you've
got
nothing
to
apply
you
prices
to.
now
in
the
pensacola
area,
it
is
actually
a
deficit
area.
i
think
on
theories
in
the
united
states,
it
is
a
milk
deficit
area.
the
record
shows
and
the
commission
does
not
contested
that
there
has
been
a
surplus
milk
situation
in
united
states
for
over
10
years
and
that
there
still
is
and
i
think
they're
all
with
will
be
surplus
milk
situation.
the
polar
company
states
that
70%
of
its
total
usage
of
milk
or
in
other
words
70%
of
milk,
they
process
through
that
plant,
comes
from
out-of-state.
the
30%
of
what
they
could
do
are
processed
and
package
comes
from
the
milk
marketing
area
in
pensacola
area.
now,
out
of
the
70%,
it
comes
in
the
polar,
polar
has
no
contractual
arrangement,
they
have
no
base
arrangement,
they
have
no
other
arrangement
with
any
other
state,
any
other
producers.
i
challenge
the
appellant
to
show
in
his
record
where
there's
any
testimony
as
to
regular
alabama
producers.
now,
he
is
trying
to
infer
to
this
court
that
because
pensacola
is
only
16
miles
from
the
alabama
state
line
that
they
carry
on
a
regular
course
of
business
with
alabama
producers.
that
is
not
the
case.
they
buy
from
a
milk
brokerage
firm
and
the
demopolis,
alabama
come
and
know
as
the
black
belt
theory
cooperative
incorporated.
we
call
it
cooperative
but
in
effects
it's
actually
a
corporation.
they
buy
surplus
milk.
the
alabama
milk
control
board
regulates
prices
in
alabama.
they
regulate
the
milk
business
in
alabama.
they're
telling
alabama
is
distributed
it
for
every
gallon
of
class
i
milk
that
you
sell,
you
must
pay
your
alabama
producers
56
and
a
half
cents
per
gallon.
mr.
zirkleback,
the
president
of
the
polar
company
in
the
trial
of
the
case
and
it
appears
in
the
record
states
that
they
--
he
can
go
in
alabama
and
buy
milk
for
30
cents
per
gallon.
may
it
please
the
court,
the
only
milk
he
buy
for
30
cents
of
gallon
is
surplus
milk
and
we
are
not
prohibits
him
from
doing
that.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
not
to
the
extent
that
florida
commission
does
mr.
justice
goldberg.
alabama,
i
understand,
wants
follow
what
florida
us
doing.
but
at
the
present
time,
they
are
faced
with
an
influx
of
milk
from
mississippi
and
tennessee
and
arkansas
into
northern
alabama.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes,
sir.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
that
is
correct
your
honor,
yes,
sir.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes,
sir.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes,
sir.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
now,
perhaps,
the
base
order
might
go
a
half
step
further,
a
state
that
you
must
accept
that
because
of
the
base
order
--
now
the
base
order
guarantees
to
polar
that
it's
going
to
get
pretty
much
so
many
gallons
per
day
and
per
week,
per
month
out
of
the
pensacola
area.
a
producer
of
polar
may
not
go
to
border
to
sell
his
milk,
may
not
go
with
the
formal,
they
may
not
go
to
seal
test.
his
milk
must
be
transported
from
his
barn
to
polar.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes
but
sir
except.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes
except
--
yes,
let
me
not
mislead.
you
owned
this
--
the
order
does
not
specify
the
30%.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
but
based
on
the
present
application
of
approximately
the
proportion
of
milk
that
had
being
produced
by
the
florida
producers
and
sold
to
the
polar
plant.
now,
the
order
further
states
that
there's
110%
and
115%
provision
which
is
really,
really
--
you
might
call
it
a
nice
hair
we
called
the
distributor
must
accept
up
to
110%
of
the
producer's
milk
that
he
must
only
pay
for
that
percentage
that
actually
gets
into
class
i
sale.
the
surplus
is
only
a
surplus
price,
your
class
ii,
iii,
and
iv
prices.
now,
the
florida
commission
follows
the
pricing
schedule
of
the
federal
milk
marketing
area
which
is
in
existence
in
southeast
florida,
some
eight
counties
and
southeast
florida
has
a
federal
order.
now,
we
follow
their
price
allocation
and
definitions
on
class
ii,
iii,
and
iv
milk.
whatever
their
price
is,
we
allow
the
same
price
to
the
florida
producers
in
our
area
and
that
is
in
effect
based
upon
the
chicago
commodity
exchange.
so
we
say
that
--
that
to
whatever
extent,
polar
has
class
i
sales
in
florida,
florida
only
that
they
must
first
use
the
milk
that
is
assigned
to
them
by
these
producers
that
is
guaranteed
to
them
to
you.
they
use
that
milk,
and
the
record
is
very
incomplete
on
it's
phase
and
i'm
sure
that
you
will
observe
it
and
reading
the
record
that
the
judge
jones,
judge
caldwell
and
judge
devane,
the
three
judges
who
herd
the
case
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
polar
company
had
no
records
on
actual
sales
and
utilizations.
they
could
not
prove
and
did
not
prove
at
the
trial
of
this
case
as
to
what
extent
of
their
sales
where
in
florida,
as
to
what
percentage
of
the
florida
produced
milk
went
in
the
florida
sale.
mr.
zirkleback
stated
that
as
far
as
he
was
concerened,
he
did
not
keep
records
that
he's
treated
milk
as
he
would
have
can
of
sardines,
it
was
only
altogether.
and
i
don't
see
how
that
they
can
come
in
to
this
court
with
all
of
these
issues
as
to
the
commerce
clause
when
there's
nothing
into
record
on
the
any
violation
of
the
commerce
clause,
whatsoever.
we
did
strictly
with
a
local
situation.
now,
i
might
make
one
further
observation,
that
when
polar
first
came
in
the
court,
they
came
into
the
military
question
with
mr.
horne
has
discussed
and
there
are
many
complaints.
they
finally
got
into
to
a
face
of
commerce
by
saying
in
paragraph
43
of
their
amended
complaint.
polar
says
that
“because
florida
milk
commission
forces
us,
requires
us
to
take
all
of
the
florida
produced
milk
and
any
surplus
produce
milk
and
use
it
in
our
sales.
first,
it
violates
a
commerce
clause.
we
do
not
do
that.
we
only
say
that
you
have
to
take
the
florida
milk
insofar
as
the
class
i
sale
was
utilized.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes
except
the
from
what
the
argument--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes,
but
we
say
that
any
sales
he
wants
to
put
in
the
military,
he
is
free
to
contract
fort
on
out-of-state
milk
or
on
any
other
produced
milk
in
florida.
but
we
say
that
a
class
i
sale
and
we
will
further
do
insofar
as
pricing
is
concerned,
is
this
milk
sold
on
the
street,
in
the
store
or
delivered
to
the
houses.
we
don't
want
do
that
any
way
regulate
military
milk.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
mr.
justice
white,
he
may
go
to
his
florida
producers
and
say
that
after
i
use
your
milk
to
the
extent
of
my
class
i
sale.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
military
milk
is
specifically
defined,
although
it
might
be
fresh
wholesome
fluid
milk.
we
have
a
separate
category
for
military
sales
so
that
we
won't
in
any
way
try
to
regulate.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
no,
sir.
we
still
have
the
definition.
we
just
do
not
have
a
military
order
in
the
pensacola
area.
alright
so
i'll
try
to
explain
it
if
i
might.
mr.
horne
actually
had
the
military
phrased
this
question.
but
in
any
milk
order,
in
the
milk
areas
excuse
me,
there
is
in
effect
what
we
call
a
military
order
which
states
that
the
producers
have
agreed
to
produce
milk
to
be
sold
to
the
military
at
a
free
arranged
price
between
the
producer
and
the
distributor.
they
have
agreed.
they
have
contractually
made
and
argued
and
set
a
price
and
then
producer
say
that,
“we
will
produce
surplus
milk
and
you
can
put
it
in
the
military.”
the
--
initially
when
this
case
was
filed,
there
was
a
military
order
in
effect
in
the
pensacola
area.
that
order
was
voted
out
by
the
producers.
in
other
words,
the
producers
are
saying
that
we
cannot
produce
milk,
keeping
it
for
you
to
bid
on
the
military
that
we
are
like
any
other
businessmen
that
we
don't
want
to
sell
our
goods
at
a
loss
just
to
give
you
the
privilege
of
bidding
on
a
military
contract
with
any
other
contract.
that
we
know
what
it
cost
us
to
produce
milk
and
we
can't
sell
that
cheap.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
sir?
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
there
is
in
the
general
allocation
order
which
i'm
not
sure
if
it's
in
the
record
or
not.
that
classifies
a
separate
and
distinct
classification
of
military
milk
so
that
if
producers
want
to
produce
for
surplus
milk
for
that,
they
might.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
we
disagree
with
that
contingent
mr.
justice
white
because
of
the
reason
that
this
one
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
the
contention
of
the
commission
is
this
very
brief
with
that.
so
long
as
he
has
class
i
sale,
in
other
words
apart
from
military,
taking
military
out
separate.
if
he
has
class
i
sale,
separate
from
his
military,
he
must
take
a
florida
produce
milk
first
and
put
it
into
the
class
i
sale.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
after
the
class
i
sales
are
used
up,
this
milk
becomes
surplus
milk.
he
make
contract
with
those
producers
for
diverting
in
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
insofar
as
pricing
his
concern
is
not
your
honor.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
sir?
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes,
sir.
now,
a
word
if
i
might
about
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
if
the
producers
wish
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes,
sir.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
well,
we're
not
holding
them
at
all
in
that
one
point.
let
me
say
one
point
i
meant
about
the
way
the
price
is
determined
for
class
i
sales
in
florida.
the
statute
it's
very
clear
in
the
elements,
the
florida
milk
commission
must
consider
in
arriving
at
a
class
i
price.
as
i
mentioned,
it
was
61
cents
and
they
reduced
it
to
59
cents.
they
had
a
detail
price
study
that
what
it
cost
to
raise
a
gallon
of
milk
or
produce
a
gallon
of
milk
in
florida,
whether
it
be
for
sales
to
a
supermarket,
to
a
house
or
any
other
purpose
of
which
it
was
intended
to
be
used,
it
cost
the
same.
they
took
into
consideration
the
cost
of
the
cows,
the
land,
the
taxes,
the
real
state
taxes
of
course,
the
property
taxes,
the
labor,
the
bid,
and
they
inserted
a
minimum
amount
for
overhead
and
profit.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes,
sir.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
no
sir,
we
had
no
jurisdiction
whatsoever
in
alabama.
and
i
would
--
they
have
speculated
and
not
even
attempted
to
say
what
it
cost
to
raise
a
gallon
of
milk
in
alabama,
i
have
no
idea.
i
know
that
if
mr.
zirkleback
can
buy
the
30
cents
of
gallon,
surplus
milk
over
there,
that's
indicative
to
me
that
it
can
be
produce
to
that.
however,
the
commission,
control
board,
all
had
said
he
produced
price
56
and
a
half
cent
for
a
gallon.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
have
run
across
one
federal
case
and
it
involved
a
milk
marketing
--
federal
milk
marketing
area
which
is
in
st.
louis.
but
i
think
that
the
requirement
as
to
infringement
upon
the
importation
of
outside
milk
would
be
substantial
saying
on
the
federal
act
as
on
the
state
regulation.
and
i
was
going
to
discuss
that
case
after
lunch
very
briefly.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
--
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
lunch
recess,
i
had
finished
summarizing
my
argument
as
to
point
one
that
polar
claimed
was
the
reason
that
this
order
or
the
regulation
on
the
statute
of
the
florida
milk
commission
violate
the
commerce
clause.
now,
the
second
point
that
they
urged
in
their
mini
complaint
was
that
because
florida
milk
commission
had
them
pay
the
florida
producers
61
cents
per
gallon
for
milk
that
after
they
did
that
it
economically,
they
were
unable
to
go
out
and
compete
for
milk.
and
very
briefly,
i
state
that
because
they
readily
admit
in
their
record,
in
the
testimony
and
this
is
the
record
back
at
the
trial
as
they
are
able
to
go
out
and
buy
milk
at
any
time
for
30
cents
a
gallon
or
35
cents
of
gallon,
36
cents
a
gallon,
that
economically
they
have
not
been
heard
at
all
by
virtue
of
the
requirement
that
they
pay
the
florida
producers,
a
class
i
producer
price.
now,
in
summary
as
to
the
commission
position
as
to
whether
or
not
it
violates
the
commerce
clause,
we
steadfastly
and
affirmatively
state,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
we
are
dealing
only
with
a
local
problem,
that
we're
not
in
any
way
attempting
to
regulate
commerce,
that
we're
not
in
any
way
attempting
to
go
into
alabama
or
mississippi
or
arkansas
or
wisconsin,
any
other
state
and
this
circle
back
buys
his
milk.
we
are
not
going
in
that
state
of
regulating
it.
we
are
merely
dealing
with
a
local
problem
in
pensacola
that
is
similar
to
the
problem
we
have
in
each
of
our
other
four
milk
marketing
areas.
now,
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
no
sir,
we
do
not
sir.
mr.
justice
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
no
sir
mr.
justice
black,
the
--
any
distributor
who
buys
milk
from
other
state
is
treated
the
same
as
they
distributed
buys
all
these
milk
from
interstate.
there's
no
penalty,
there's
no
burden,
there's
no
any
other
tax
other
than
a
tax
that's
always
been
discussed
here
today
which
is
the
--
the
taxes
supposedly
working
of
the
milk
commission.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
until
only
on
--
only
after
it
has
used.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes
sir,
the
--
the
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes
sir
class
i
milk.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes
sir
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes
sir,
if
they're
still
supplying
class
i
sales.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
may
it
--
mr.
--
mr.
justice
black,
we
feel
that
it
is
not
a
--
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
in
any
respects
because
we're
dealing
with
only
a
local
problem
first
under
our
police
power
and
that
is
to
ensure
a
wholesome
supply
of
fresh
milk
to
the
consumers
in
the
state
of
florida
and
to
promote
the
dairy
industry
in
the
state
of
florida
which
is
--
which
were
charged
with
under
our
law,
which
has
been
upheld
by
this
court
--
the
(inaudible)
law
which
has
been
upheld
by
this
court
many
times
before.
we
don't
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
as
i
understand
the
--
the
original
case
of
nebbia
versus
new
york
upheld
the
right
of
a
state
to
impose
a
milk
control
law,
to
promote
the
dairy
industry
within
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
florida
laws
model
quite
substantially
after
the
new
york
law.
also
it
is
quite
similar
to
the
pennsylvania
law
and
the
virginia
law.
now,
mr.
justice
goldberg
asked
me
right
before
lunch
about
this
base
plan
and
wanting
to
know
if
were
there
any
decisions
on
it.
there
is
a
decision
in
the
state
of
florida
which
has
been
cited
our
brief
which
is
the
borden
company
versus
odham,
the
previous
milk
--
chairman
of
the
milk
commission
and
that's
cited
in
121
so.2d
625.
and
that
case
upheld
the
right
of
the
florida
milk
commission
to
--
as
a
--
as
a
measure
of
putting
the
producers
and
distributor
together,
upheld
the
right
to
assign
bases
of
a
producer
and
a
plant.
and
that
would
throughout
the
state
of
florida
and
the
four
areas
with
the
exception
of
the
pensacola
area
at
that
time,
pensacola
was
not
under
the
florida
milk
commission
so
there
was
no
burying
of
that
case
on
pensacola.
but
again
the
florida
milk
commission,
the
right
in
the
other
four
areas
to
pass
such
a
base
order
that
we
have
passed
and
we
have
an
application
in
those
four
areas
and
it's
the
same
base
order
that
we
have
now
passed
for
the
pensacola
area.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
the
--
insofar
as
it
would
be
limited
to
the
producers
that
have
earned
a
base
in
a
particular
distributing
plant
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
dealing
--
mr.
justice
white,
with
the
hypothetical
question,
i
feel
that
our
base
order
would
too
vastly
do
that,
but
we
do
not
have
that
situation
in
pensacola
area.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
we
have
strictly
deficit
area
out
there.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
i
don't
so
argue
that
is
mr.
justice
black.
my
argument
is
it
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
my
--
perhaps,
i
haven't
understood
your
question
but
--
but
our
argument
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
no,
sir.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
the
effect
of
our
statue
is
that
we
will
license
a
distributor.
for
instance,
a
new
distributor
could
come
into
pensacola
today
and
be
licensed
as
a
milk
distributor,
if
the
otherwise
meets
the
--
the
requirements
of
our
law.
he
is
not
got
any
previous
producers
tied
to
him
in
effect
until
there
is
a
base
building
period
in
his
plant.
he
is
free
to
buy
his
milk
where
he
wishes
to
buy.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes
sir,
except
that
going
back
prior
to
the
time
the
milk
commission
went
back
into
jurisdiction,
these
are
the
same
producers
heed
by
contract
with
buying
and
paying
the
same
price
for
prior
the
time
we
went
into
control,
and
we
merely
picked
up
where
that
left
off
and
assign
these
producers
a
base
in
that
plant
which
they
had
already
previously
earned.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
in
--
in
the
pensacola
area,
i
don't
think
it
has
any
effect
on
it
mr.
justice
black,
because
you
have
a
deficit
area
and
secondly,
because
you
have
a
--
a
guarantee
of
milk
from
florida
producers
to
a
florida
plant
to
be
sold
locally
in
the
state
of
florida.
you're
dealing
only
with
a
local
problem
under
the
police
power.
i
don't
think
that
that
milk
commission
may
--
could
tell
polar
they
had
to
sell
florida
milk
in
alabama
or
had
to
sell
florida
milk
in
mississippi
or
any
other
state.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
i
think
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes,
sir.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
let
me
read
that,
the
defendant
does
not
attempt
to
--
the
fist
page
of
it
is
that,
we
do
not
tell
polar
what
it
must
was
pay
for
any
out-of-state
milk
it
buys.
he
is
free
of
contract
for
any
way
it
wants
to.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
it
maybe
used
for
any
use
polar
wishes
to
make
of
it
mr.
justice
douglas,
but
on
our
base
plant,
he
must
first
use
a
florida
milk
in
florida
sales.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes
--
now
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
i
--
i
was
going
to
--
that
we,
in
any
way
limit
except
that
he
must
first
use
the
florida
milk
in
class
--
in
florida
class
i
sale.
he
is
free
at
any
time
to
buy
any
other
milk
he
wishes
at
any
other
price.
he
can
manufacture
with
it.
he
can
sell
it
to
military.
he
can
sell
it
back
in
alabama,
to
mississippi,
any
place
he
wishes
to
sell.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
there
--
mr.
justice
white,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
than
an
alabama
producer
had
been
attempting
to
compete.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
that
--
there
is
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
that
is
correct
and
if
the
alabama
milk
is
sold
by
an
alabama
distributor
in
florida,
the
alabama
distributor
must
pay
that
alabama
producer
56
and
half
cents
per
gallon.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
for
retail
sale.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
no
sir,
except
that
he
must
comply
with
the
fair
trade
practice
order
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
--
which
is
--
is
a
part
from
this
producer
price.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
at
the
same
price,
polar
must
sell
it
for.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes
sir.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
no
only
selling
in
that
the
alabama
distributors
not
have
any
economic
advantage
on
the
retail
selling
in
whatsoever.
in
fact,
he
got
an
additional
cost
of
transporting
it
into
florida
sir.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
some
of
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
well,
some
of
the
56
and
half
cents
now
--
so
that
the
court
will
not
be
misled.
the
--
the
price
now
is
59
cents
and
not
61
out
there.
so
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
that's
correct
your
honor,
he
does
not.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
the
baldwin-seelig
case
as
i
understood
it
had
to
do
with
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
and
the
state
of
vermont,
and
the
state
of
new
york
told
these
dealers
that
they
could
not
sell
milk
in
the
state
of
new
york
unless
they
paid
as
much
that
they
would
have
to
pay
if
they
bought
new
york
milk.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes
sir,
but
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
they're
as
the
same
mr.
justice
douglas
because
in
the
baldwin
and
seelig
case,
seelig
brought
all
of
his
milk
out
of
vermont.
he
bought
from
a
separate
corporation
that
he
owned
in
vermont,
the
seelig
creamery,
and
he
bought
it
from
locally
produced
--
local
producers
in
the
state
of
vermont.
he
transported
a
hunk
of
90
%
in
cans
and
he
sold
after
he
transported
it
in
the
state
of
new
york
90%
in
the
containers
and
in
10%
he
processed
all
of
his
milk,
he
sold
in
new
york
came
from
vermont.
every
drop
and
the
state
of
new
york
said,
“we
will
not
give
you
a
license
and
be
illegal
for
you
to
sell
this
milk
in
new
york
unless
you
pay
vermont
the
same
thing
you
have
to
pay
for
new
york
milk.”
and
as
i
understood
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
no,
sir.
they
--
they
may
sell
it.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes,
sir.
but
they
are
free
to
buy
and
make
any
use
of
it
and
manufacture
it.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
well,
it
--
it
can
still
--
in
the
pensacola
area,
there
is
a
position
where
that
there
are
still
class
i
sales
available
running
out-of-state
milk.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
only
from
the
producers
that
have
earned
a
base
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes,
sir.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
if
it
in
fact,
and
if
this
court
finds
that
such
a
regulatory
scheme
places
the
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
it
is
such
an
insignificant
burden
as
compared
with
the
--
the
police
power
that
the
state
have
to
regulate
his
own
industries
within
its
own
state.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes
sir.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes,
going
beyond
the
record
and
speculating
a
moment.
i
know
--
i
can't
conceive
of
any
instance
where
an
alabama
distributor
would
buy
the
milk
at
56
and
half
cents
and
get
it
into
his
plant
and
cool
it
and
transport
it
into
pensacola
and
be
able
to
sell
it
that
even
below
59
cent.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes
sir.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes
sir.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes,
now
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
it
may
your
honor.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
mr.
--
mr.
polar
may
go
into
alabama
and
buy
every
gallon
of
milk
it
could
find
at
30
cents
a
gallon
and
resell
it
to
fort
benning,
georgia.
and
i
only
say
so
in
that
is
we
feel
we
are
entitled
to
a
regulatory
tax
which
mr.
horne
discussed
this
morning.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
if
he
can
reach
an
agreement
with
the
florida
producers,
yes
sir.
the
--
the
milk
commission
is
not
stepping
back
in
this
military
milk
area
that
the
--
the
commission
feels
that
the
florida
producers
have
the
right
to
say
whether
or
not
they
wanted
milk
sold
below
cost
and
that
they
have
that
contract
right
to
do
so.
but
mr.
polar
may
buy
alabama
milk
at
30
cents
and
sell
it
to
fort
benning.
now,
may
i
please
re-brief
it
to
two
cases
which
i
may
have
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes,
sir.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes,
sir.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes,
sir.
now
there
are
two
cases
which
i
have
found
on
this
base
system
of
allocation.
now,
in
the
case
in
this
court
had
before
the
lehigh
valley
coop
versus
united
states
which
came
out
of
pennsylvania.
in
that
case,
this
court
was
asked
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
--
the
milk
administrator
had
the
right
under
the
agriculture
adjustment
act
of
1937
to
pay
as
you
order,
the
compensatory
payment
order
which
it
attempt
--
which
it
passed
and
attempted
to
enforce
and
that
order
was
struck
down
because
the
administrator
did
not
have
that
authority.
now
under
that
case,
the
section
8
(c)
(f)
(g)
of
the
act,
states
that
no
marketing
agreement
or
order
applicable
to
milk
and
its
products
in
any
marketing
area
shall
prohibit
or
in
any
manner,
limit
in
the
case
or
products
of
milk,
the
marketing
in
that
area
of
any
milk
or
product
of
any
other
production
area
--
area
in
the
united
states.
now,
in
that
case
as
i
understood
the
court's
decision,
it
suggested
that
even
though
the
"compensatory-payment”
plant
in
that
case
was
struck
down,
that
nonetheless
an
administrator
under
the
provisions
of
this
act
could
still
pass
an
order
which
stated
that
the
"compensatory-payment"
could
be
based
not
as
the
base
in
case,
but
be
based
upon
the
difference
between
what
he
pays
for
the
milk
and
a
class
i
price
in
effect
in
the
pool
of
that
particular
time.
now,
in
the
case
of
case
of
bailey
farm
dairy
versus
anderson
and
this
case
is
not
in
our
brief
and
i
like
to
give
the
court
citation
to
this
case.
157
f.2d
87,
the
name
of
the
bailey
farm
dairy
versus
anderson,
and
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court
and
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
excuse
me,
157
f.2d
87
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
came
from
--
out
of
st.
louis
area
and
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court
in
329
us
788.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes
sir
and
then
i
say
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
see
a
distinction
but
i
think
that
a
--
as
a
similarity
between
the
areas
of
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce
and
an
undue
burden
on
importation
of
milk
from
another
area
on
a
federal
milk
marketing
area,
i
think
that
--
that
substantially
the
--
the
test
would
be
the
same
if
it's
a
burden
in
one
essence,
it
was
certain
to
be
as
the
statute
says,
indirectly
or
directly
prohibit
the
importation
from
one
area
into
another
and
i
mention
this
case
for
that
one
reason
that
in
this
bailey
case
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes
sir,
we
concede
that
congress
has
the
right
to
regulate
commerce
but
we
think
that
until
congress
acts
on
a
particular
area
that
displayed
on
its
police
power,
has
a
right
to
regulate
a
local
condition
and
if
it
indirectly
affects
commerce
along
as
congress
had
not
acted
in
that
area,
then
we're
safe.
and
i
--
i
submit
to
this
court
the
same
test
for
measuring
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
could
be
same
test
on
measuring
whether
or
not
on
a
federal
milk
marketing
area,
there
was
a
burden
on
bringing
milk
in
from
one
area
into
another
area.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes,
sir,
i
do.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes
sir.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
the
--
the
milk
case
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes
sir.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
i
don't
believe
that
we
in
our
philosophy
limited
to
the
protection
only
of
the
dairy
industry.
we
with
that,
say
that
in
order
to
ensure
to
our
citizens
a
wholesome
supply
of
fresh
fluid
milk
that
the
police
power
in
the
station
be
exercised
to
regulate
the
milk
industry.
because
of
the
peculiarities
with
the
milk
industry
which
is
not
present
in
--
in
any
other
industry
that
i
know
of
as
it
is
present
with
the
milk
industry.
and
secondly
in
with
that,
we're
interested
in
not
protecting
but
promoting
the
economic
industry
of
milk
in
the
state
of
florida.
in
the
bailey
case
and
very
briefly,
the
milk
order
stated
that
a
milk
handler
must
allocate
to
his
milk
producers,
i
believe
its
85%
or
90%
of
all
of
the
milk
produced
by
those
producers
into
class
i
sales
before
he
can
bring
in
out-of-state
milk
into
that
area
and
give
it
a
class
i
sales
price.
that
the
only
difference
between
that
base
order
and
the
base
order
we
have
is
10%
and
that
is
the
only
difference.
there
is
one
other
case
and
this
is
all
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes,
sir.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white.
the
other
case
is
found
as
a
virginia
case
construing
the
virginia
milk
act
which
also
is
not
in
our
brief
is
southside
cooperative
milk
producers
association
versus
state,
92
s.e.2d
351.
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
stated
that
under
the
virginia
act
which
is
almost
the
same
as
the
florida
act
that
the
milk
control
board
had
the
right
to
assign
bases
in
a
plant
and
allocate
milk
down
to
his
base
producers.
in
summary,
i
would
like
to
say
that
position
of
florida
milk
commission
that
in
the
exercise
of
police
power
granted
in
the
statute
that
we
do
not
feel
the
we
are
burdening
interstate
commerce
but
if
we
do
is
only
incidental
and
it's
promiscuous
in
the
exercise
of
our
police
power
to
govern
and
control
merely
a
local
problem.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
we
--
we
have
frozen
a
base
mr.
justice
white
and
said
that
our
producers
cannot
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
--
increase.
the
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
only
if
the
150,000
gallons
is
within
the
base
that
has
been
frozen
and
we
froze
the
base
until
the
florida
producers,
they
cannot
produce
an
excess
of
that
amount
and
get
a
class
i
price
for
it.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
well,
--
every
month
that
polar
sales
go
up
and
down,
he
knows
that
he
can
count
on
a
100,000
or
150,000
gallons
of
milk
from
florida
producers.
he
knows
that's
coming
in.
and
that
is
one
to
the
elements
and
we
feel
that
is
a
--
a
fair
deal
for
polar
as
it
is
a
fair
deal
for
the
producers.
he's
guaranteed
that
much
milk.
you
don't
have
to
look
for
it,
it's
there.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes,
sir.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
it
was
taken
over
by
the
four-year
period.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes
sir.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
right
now
if
they
go
above
it
this
month,
he
is
free
to
contract
for
the
amount
that
is
--
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
outside.
yes,
sir.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
that's
surplus
milk
insofar
as
pricing
is
concerned.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
you
mean
the
freeze
of
the
base?
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
we're
speculating
again
as
to
whether
it
will
or
will
not
be.
we
don't
foresee
that
see
they
would
be
changed.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes,
sir.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
conceive,
yes
sir.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes.
mr.
johnson
s.
savary
yes
sir.
thank
you.
