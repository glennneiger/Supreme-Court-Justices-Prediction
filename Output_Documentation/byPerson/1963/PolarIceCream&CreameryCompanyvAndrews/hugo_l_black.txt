this

you
have
two?

where
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
your
brief
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
find
that
the
two
questions
only
presented
on
your
brief
on
page
4.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
impose
any
kind
of
burden
on
a
local
distributor
who
does
buy
milk
from
other
states
because
it's
not
imposed
on
other
distributors
of
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
kind
of
penalty
and
no
kind
of
burden?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
that
does
not
impose
a
burden?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
--
which
case
--
which
case
do
you
refer
as
upholding
that
power?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
difference
in
your
law
as
you
say
defines
and
a
statute
might
be
drawn
by
legislature
could
effect
what
dealers
buy
and
selling
milk
produced
in
florida,
hereby
prohibited
buying
milk
from
outside
the
state
to
supply
customers,
while
they
are
buying,
while
they
are
distributors
and
licensed
to
sell
at
all,
and
that
they
should
be
penalized.
is
there
any
difference?
is
that
the
effect
of
your
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice

--
you
just
said
that,
in
order
to
conserve
the
dairy
industry,
i'm
not
saying
it's
--
absolutely
would
mean
one
way
or
the
other
position.
in
order
to
conserve
the
production
of
milk
in
the
dairies
farm
of
florida,
the
florida
people
about
the
health
and
safety
of
the
people,
hereby
declared
to
be
the
policy
that
people
shall
only
sell,
distribute
milk
in
the
state
of
florida,
florida
milk,
would
have
a
license
and
none
shall
be
granted
a
license
unless
they
agree
in
advance
that
they
will
first
buy
all
their
milk
from
this
florida,
before
they
buy
it
from
any
other
states
and
it
should
be
a
crime
for
them
to
buy
milk
from
any
other
states
under
--
in
that
situation.
is
that
the
--
is
that
the
effect
of
your
sentence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
he
gets
the
license
under
this,
you
say
he's
not.
he's
got
to
buy
from
them
at
61
cents
i
understood
you
to
say,
until
all
their
milk's
exhausted
and
during
that
time,
he
can't
buy
any
from
outside
of
the
state
to
supply
his
need.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
effect
does
that
have
on
the
interstate
commerce
question
involved?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
get
your
difference.
the
sentence
to
which
justice
douglas
declared
to
your
case
in
186
had
not,
do
the
regulation,
restrict
plaintiff
from
purchasing
out-of-state
milk
in
any
amount
or
for
any
price.
i
understand
you
say
that
is
to
rest
but
it
does
keep
him
from
selling.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
class
i
milk
in
florida
unless
they
have
already
exhausted
the
florida
market.
justice
hugo
l.
black
free
to
buy
and
make
use
of
it
except
for
them
to
use
in
which
they
want
to
make.
class
i
--
class
i.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
may
--
that
maybe
true
but
so
far
as
these
people
are
concerned
as
i
understand
it,
what
you
have
is
a
circulation.
well,
why
do
you
--
when
a
man
gets
a
license
and
he's
a
dealer,
he
can't
buy
class
i
milk
outside
to
the
state
and
sell
it,
purchases
in
florida
unless
he
first
shows
that
he's
exhausted
all
the
supply
of
class
i
milk
to
be
purchased
inside
florida.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
whoever
it
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
does
place
or
whatever
amount
it
is
but
it
is
the
right
amount.
but
it
does
place
a
burden
on
people
who
wants
to
sell
milk
in
there
because
their
customers,
if
they
--
if
they
get
their
milk,
they
can
sell
it
except
in
the
classification
which
brings
them
price
below
that
which
they
can
sell,
isn't
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
have
just
one
question
on
that
in
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
what
you're
are
saying
is
that
the
state
has
not,
by
regulation
or
otherwise,
put
any
burden
that
would
keep
the
military
government
from
buying
on
a
competitive
basis,
is
that
what
i
am
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
a
man
maybe
unable
to
buy
from
a
producer,
in
course
demand
the
producer
voluntarily
desires
not
to
sell
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we're
getting
back
to
that
basis
as
to
what
the
state
doing,
what
the
individual
did.
