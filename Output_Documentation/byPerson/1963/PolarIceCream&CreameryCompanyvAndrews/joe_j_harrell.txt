mr.
joe
j.
harrell
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
action
and
a
direct
appeal
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
district
court
which
was
convened
in
the
northern
district
of
florida.
an
action
was
brought
by
polar
ice
cream
and
creamery
company
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
a
portion
of
the
florida
milk
commission
act
being
chapter
501
florida
statutes.
the
complaint,
an
amended
complaint
asked
for
injunctive
relief
and
also
asked
for
declaratory
relief
with
respect
to
the
application
of
certain
orders
insofar
as
they
affected
the
polar
ice
cream
and
creamery
company
which
is
a
milk
distributor
located
in
pensacola,
florida
which
is
16
miles
from
the
alabama
state
line.
the
lower
court
considered
three
questions
and
one
was
whether
or
not
the
application
of
a
portion
of
this
act
and
the
orders
which
implemented
it
by
the
florida
milk
commission
burdened
unduly
interstate
commerce,
also
whether
or
not
minimum
producer
prices
with
respect
to
sale
made
to
military
installation
could
be
enforced
by
the
state
of
florida.
and
the
third
question
which
the
district
court
considered
was
whether
or
not
the
distributor's
tax
on
milk
distributed
which
was
15
cents
per
100
gallons,
milk
distributed
by
a
florida
producer,
polar
ice
cream
and
creamery
company
to
military
installations
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
which
have
been
seeded
to
the
united
states
was
in
fact
applicable
and
collectible
by
the
state
of
florida.
those
were
the
three
questions
which
the
district
court
determined
adversely
to
the
polar
ice
cream
and
creamery
company,
and
from
this
adverse
decision,
a
direct
appeal
is
taken
to
this
court.
in
november
1961,
the
pensacola
area
which
consisted
of
the
western
most
four
counties
located
within
the
state
of
florida
came
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
florida
milk
commission.
these
four
counties,
prior
to
that
time
had
been
without
the
jurisdiction
of
florida
--
of
the
florida
milk
commission.
immediately
after
they
came
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
florida
milk
commission,
the
florida
milk
commission
began
a
scheme
which
we
contend
burden
unduly
interstate
commerce.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
it
was
a
vote
by
the
milk
producers
of
those
four
counties.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
of
those
four
counties,
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
yes
under
state
of
law,
they
voted
in
on
november
21,
1961,
they
came
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
florida
milk
commission.
the
first
thing
that
the
florida
milk
commission
did
with
respect
to
these
four
counties
was
to
set
a
minimum
producer
price
of
61
cents
per
gallon
which
was
the
highest
price
in
the
united
states,
the
highest
published
price
in
the
united
states
as
that
--
as
of
that
time.
the
second
thing
that
the
milk
commission
did
to
implement
this
particular
scheme
was
to
enter
an
allocation
order
in
which
it
allocated
all
of
the
class
i
sales
to
florida
milk
commissions
to
florida
milk
producers
and
set
up
in
a
ratio
which
total
100%
of
all
sales,
the
amount
of
sales
which
were
to
be
allocated
to
each
particular
producer
of
polar
ice
cream
and
creamery
company.
the
third
ground
which
implemented
this
particular
scheme
was
the
law
which
said
that
polar
ice
cream
and
creamery
company
or
a
milk
distributor
could
not
terminate
its
relationship
with
a
producer
except
for
just
cause.
and
the
court
has
held
that
just
cause
is
not
--
that
is
not
just
cause
if
he
could
buy
his
milk
cheaper
elsewhere.
there
was
a
further
implementation
in
that
if
--
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
the
florida
court.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
yes,
i
do
have
mr.
justice
white.
it
is
in
odom
versus
the
state
of
florida.
i
cited
in
my
brief.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
yes,
the
supreme
court
state
of
florida.
also
if
the
milk
distributor
does
not
take
all
of
the
milk
tendered
to
it
by
the
florida
producers,
then
of
course
a
show-cause
order
can
the
--
set
against
the
distributor
and
his
license
can
be
revoked.
so
that
we
have
here
a
situation
in
which
the
florida
milk
producers
and
i'm
speaking
about
the
pensacola
area,
florida
milk
producers,
the
ones
pertinent
to
this
case.
although
they
are
located
--
although
the
pensacola
plant
of
polar
is
just
16
miles
from
the
alabama
line,
nevertheless
the
florida
milk
producers
of
polar
are
insulated
so
that
they
are
guaranteed
in
effect
the
highest
price
in
the
united
states
for
the
sale
of
their
milk.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
yes.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that
is
not
exactly
accurate.
polar
must
buy
first
from
these
producers
and
must
exhaust
their
supply
of
milk
insofar
as
its
class
i
needs,
a
concern
before
it
can
go
elsewhere
and
purchase
milk.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
no,
it
can
go
outside
of
florida
after
it
satisfies
the
class
i
requirements
from
the
milk
tended
it
by
its
florida
producers.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
no.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
no
sir,
it's
not
geared
to
that.
it's
geared
to
the
--
to
the
class
i
sales.
polar
must
purchase
insofar
as
florida
producers
can
furnish
it
all
of
its
requirements
of
class
i
sale
even
to
the
extent
of
115%
in
excess
of
its
requirements
of
class
i
sales
before
it
can
go
outside.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that
is
correct.
of
course,
it
will
immediately
become
obvious
then,
that
the
polar
producers
will
energetically
try
to
bill
and
increase
their
supply
--
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that's
correct.
that
is
the
whole
theory
about
it.
and
of
course,
the
record
is
clear
that
this
is
a
deficit
area
and
that
polar
gets
70%
of
its
milk
supply
from
without
the
state
of
florida
and
that
many
of
its
regular
producers
are
located
immediately
across
in
the
state
of
alabama.
we
directly
will
reflect
that,
we
have
cited
the
gallonage
including
from
black
belt
producers
which
is
right
across
alabama
and
this
alabama
producers.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that
is
correct
sir
for
class
i
sales.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
not
class
i
sales
because
they
have
the
other
classifications
you
see.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that's
correct
but
it
means
that
--
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
the
record
is
unclear
of
other
than
to
this
extent.
the
testimony
was
that
at
times,
the
florida
producers
produced
more
than
the
class
i
sales
and
at
other
times,
they
did
not.
the
record
is
unclear
with
respect
to
that
particular
percentage.
but
this
means
of
course
that
that
an
alabama
producer,
even
though
he
--
the
closer
in
fact
geographically
will
never
have
an
opportunity
of
selling
at
a
class
1
price
to
polar
until
all
of
polar's
florida
producers
have
been
given
the
opportunity
of
getting
the
class
i
sales.
so
that
the
out-of-state
producers
are
insulated
and
isolated
from
selling
to
polar
by
a
tariff
barrier
and
by
a
tariff
wall
which
economically
is
just
as
real
as
can
be.
in
that
result,
economically
of
course
will
be
this.
it
will
be
that
polar
will
have
to
then
either
go
out
and
pay
and
buy
its
class
ii
sales
or
class
iii
or
iv
needs
from
outside
sources
at
a
lower
price
because
this
court
of
course
is
familiar
with
the
classification
of
milk
and
that
class
i
received
the
highest
price
and
the
price
paid
decreases
in
the
decreasing
scale
of
classification.
so
that
it
means
that
the
alabama
producer
or
the
mississippi
producer
even
though
he'll
be
a
regular
producer
could
never
have
an
opportunity
literally
to
eat
at
the
first
table
until
after
all
of
the
needs
of
class
i
sales
of
polar
are
satisfied
insofar
as
florida
producers
are
able
to
satisfy
those
needs.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that
is
absolutely
correct
your
honor
and
--
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
and
--
or
not
at
all.
that's
right.
it
would
be
one
of
the
way.
the
economic
factor
could
be
reflected
in
two
ways.
on
polar,
it
would
mean
that
polar
would
have
to
go
out
and
pay
a
higher
price
in
order
to
assure
the
supply
of
the
milk.
looking
the
other
way,
it
would
mean
that
alabama
could
never
have
an
opportunity.
alabama
or
other
outside
producers
could
never
have
an
opportunity
of
selling
at
the
class
i
price
or
the
61-cent
price
so
that
they
would
either
have
to
accept
a
price
which
would
be
economically
feasible
for
the
purchase
of
class
ii,
iii
and
iv
milk
or
else
they
could
say,
“no,”
as
the
court
said,
“we
can
drink
the
milk
but
sell
to
you
we
cannot
unless
you
play
the
--“
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
right
because
--
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that's
right.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that's
correct
and
so
then
--
then
it
would
be
confronted
with
this
situation
where
it
would
be
cheaper
to
purchase
class
ii
from
florida
because
economically,
they
could
not
go
out
to
purchase
class
ii
from
alabama,
mississippi
or
some
other
state
at
a
price
which
would
be
economically
be.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
in
a
play
--
in
order
to
assure
the
supply,
yes
sir.
and
that
is
basically
--
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
i
believe
that
it's
in
the
record
that
it
was
54
and
half
cents
with
respect
to
the
class
i.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
yes,
yes.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
no,
sir
there's
--
there's
no
federal
marketing
order
involved
in
this
area.
if
we
go
to
the
next
question
which
was
considered
by
the
lower
court,
we
find
this
situation
that
polar
ice
cream
and
creamery
companies
throughout
the
years
and
the
record
reflects
that
for
the
past
eight
years,
it
has
supplied
the
milk
requirements
of
fort
benning
georgia
among
other
military
installations.
the
milk
requirement
for
fort
benning
georgia
per
year
under
the
contract
which
was
in
evidence
was
$1,760,000.
so
it
was
a
sizable
contract.
also
polar
supplies
the
pensacola
naval
air
station,
tyndall
field
air
force
base,
which
is
located
at
panama
city,
florida
and
also
the
mine
defense
laboratory
at
panama
city,
florida.
now
of
each
these
military
installations
with
the
exception
of
the
mine
defense
laboratory,
the
military
installations
are
located
on
property
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
which
had
been
seeded
to
the
united
states
of
america,
some
of
this
--
some
of
these
installations
having
been
seeded
as
early
1855
which
is
the
pensacola
naval
air
station
reservation.
but
on
each
of
the
others,
by
deed
of
cession,
the
military
installations
are
located
on
the
property
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
which
has
been
seeded
to
the
united
states.
we
are
then
confronted
with
the
next
question
in
which
court
considered
and
that
was
this,
“can
the
state
of
florida
enforce
its
minimum
producer
price
of
61
cents
against
sales
which
are
made
to
military
installations
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
which
have
been
seeded
to
the
united
states?”
and
as
an
ancillary,
the
question
to
the
u.s.
mine
defense
laboratory
to
which
the
record
is
unclear
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
an
exclusive
deed
of
cession
but
it
appears
that
there
was
none.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
yes
sir.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
yes,
through
the
testimony
of
mr.
e.v.
fisher.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
no
sir,
no
sir.
at
a
price
--
or
excuse
me
i
misunderstood
--
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
yes,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that
is
fisher
and
also
--
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
our
complaint
is
this
that
it
means
that
no
military
personnel
in
florida
can
drink
florida
milk.
it
means
that
if
one
gallon
of
florida
milk
although
it's
located,
the
pensacola
naval
air
station
is
located
within
three
or
four
miles
of
this
plant,
it's
right
in
pensacola.
if
a
gallon
of
florida
milk
is
delivered
to
that
pensacola
naval
air
station,
the
producer
must
be
paid
61
cents
per
gallon
for
each
and
every
gallon
of
florida
milk.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that
is
correct.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that
is
correct.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that
is
correct
because
of
the
peculiarity
under
the
procurement
policy
and
the
peculiarity
of
the
fact
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
this
military
installation
was
seeded
to
the
united
states
and
that
the
state
of
florida
is
without
jurisdiction
to
say
that
this
florida
produced
milk
must
be
delivered
at
61
cents
per
gallon
paid
to
florida
producers.
now,
insofar
as
other
milk
for
example
--
insofar
other
florida
milk
that
is
not
the
crux
of
the
question
but
it
turns
basically
on
that
issue.
and
so
i
hoped
i
made
myself
clear
with
respect
to
that
time.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
yes
sir.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
well,
i
can
--
i
can
only
cite
and
it
will
take
only
a
moment
if
the
court
will
permit
to
read
exactly
what
the
lower
court,
judge
caldwell
in
his
opinion
stated
the
issues
to
be.
and
the
very
first
issue
and
i
quote
from
182
of
the
record,
"whether
chapter
5
or
1,
florida
statutes
and
the
regulations
and
orders
of
defendants
has
applied
to
milk
delivered
by
plaintiff
to
military
reservations
are
constitutional.”
and
that's
at
page
181
and
that
was
the
first
issue
that
the
judge
himself
considered.
and
he
squarely
considers
that
and
he
squarely
considers
and
in
fact
discusses
the
polar
case
at
the
time
in
his
opinions
stating
that
the
polar
case
had
not
been
decided
at
the
time
that
he
wrote
his
opinion.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
package
been
delivered
and
processed.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that
is
very
true.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
because
if
florida
milk
is
used,
because
florida
is
the
cheapest
source
of
supplies
because
the
milk
does
not
involve
transportation
cost,
it
of
course
would
be
the
most
readily
available
with
a
guaranteed
source
of
supply
and
if
it
were
used
to
fill
the
military
contracts
then
of
course
each
gallon
would
had
--
would
have
to
be
paid
for
as
the
rate
of
61.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
yes
sir
and
i
direct
the
court's
attention
to
mr.
fisher's
testimony
in
which
he
states
that
yes
if
it
is
to
the
military,
it
would
be
at
the
rate
of
61
cents
per
gallon.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that
there
is
absolutely
squarely,
their
position.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
well,
that's
right.
and
i
quoted
page
--
at
page
148
of
the
record
your
honor
and
you
can
put
your
hand
right
on
it.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
so
that
is
--
that
is
the
exact
position
and
that
is
the
position
and
as
i
understood
issues
and
as
the
judge
caldwell
understood
him
when
he
wrote
the
opinion.
that
was
the
issue
which
he
considered
with
respect
to
the
use
of
military
milk
insofar
as
the
fulfilling
of
the
military
contracts,
the
use
of
florida
milk,
excuse
me.
then
we
come
to
the
third
--
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
yes
sir?
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
no
sir,
no.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
the
logic
behind
the
argument
is
that
it
is
certainly
and
in
appearance
with
the
procurement
policy
of
the
united
states
leaving
aside
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
location
of
the
situs
of
this
that
certainly
is
an
interference
if
they
say
all
(inaudible)
who
want
to
use
florida
milk,
you
can
bid
on
this
contract
although
polar
has
had
this
contract
for
eight
years
but
if
he
uses
florida
milk,
he
must
begin
by
paying
a
producer
price
of
61
cents
a
gallon.
the
evidence
reflects
that
he
was
delivering
packaged
and
delivered
milk
to
fort
benning
georgia
i
believe
for
58
cents
package
homogenized,
pasteurized
and
delivered
for
a
price
of
58
cents
per
gallon
sold
at
as
a
practical
economic
situation,
it
would
eliminate
any
bidder
using
florida
milk
from
bidding
on
a
military
contract.
just
the
sheer
economics
will
be
immediately
apparent.
in
other
words,
when
he
has
to
pay
for
producer
milk
3
cents
more
than
the
actual
processed
and
delivered
price,
it
puts
an
end
to
the
use
of
florida
milk
for
the
servicing
of
military
contract.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
the
united
states
has
not
sir,
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
your
honor
insofar
as
sale
to
the
united
states
government
on
--
on
military
installations
exclusive
jurisdiction
which
has
been
seeded.
it's
the
exact
same
situation
as
the
pacific
coast.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
oh
yes,
sir,
yes.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
i
do
not
intend
to
evade
your
question
but
let
me
preface
the
answer
phrase
by
saying
this.
that
as
i
understand
the
cornerstone
of
the
procurement
regulations
is
competitive
bidding
that
is
the
--
as
i
read
the
polar
case
that
is
the
absolute
cornerstone
although
secondarily
procurement
can
be
head
by
negotiations.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
the
producer
price
was
not
considered
by
in
the
polar
case
only
at
the
wholesale
price
but
it--
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
no
sir,
that's
correct.
in
the
lower
court
both
producer
and
the
wholesale
price
were
considered
when
the
case
reach
this
court
only
the
wholesale
price
was
considered
and
the
producer
price
was
not
considered.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
no
sir,
i'm
not
saying
that.
but
i
am
saying
--
i
am
saying
this,
that
--
that
if
the
--
that
if
the
producer
--
i
am
saying
this
that
if
there
is
a
fixed
produce
--
producer
price
which
has
the
effect
of
eliminating
the
use
of
florida
milk
from
the
fulfillment
of
a
contract
in
bidding
then
certainly
that
would
be
an
interference
with
a
procurement
policy
and
in
that
event,
the
state
of
florida
could
not
so
interfere.
it's
the
identical
thing
as
the
wholesale
only
these
steps
down
to
the
producer
price
which
is
the
next
level
and
--
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
only
this
suggestion
and
on--
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
well,
i
think
economically
certainly
pensacola
--
the
pensacola
naval
air
station
being
right
within
four
miles,
there
would
be
an
economic
distance
advantage
to
polar
ice
cream
and
creamery
company
bidding
on
that
contract
as
opposed
to
some
other
alabama.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
perhaps
they
would
not.
perhaps
they
could
supply
for
a
lesser
amount
as
the
record
reflects
and
as
we
have
stated
for
the
past
eight
years,
polar
ice
cream
and
creamery
company
has
been
able
to
compete
--
competitively
with
the
low
bid.
but
this
was
--
you
will
recall,
this
was
before
these
four
counties
came
under
the
--
the
florida
milk
commission
and
of
course
it
was
on
and
altogether
the
different
basis
because
at
that
time,
there
were
no
regulations
or
requirements
of
paying
a
minimum
producer
price
of
61
cents.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
well,
there
are
some
other
--
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
no.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
there
was
--
there
is
one
in
montgomery
alabama.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
and
to
be
utterly
candid
with
the
court,
there
are
a
few
people
--
there
are
few
companies
in
position
to
handle
this
quantity
of
milk.
but
the
record
reflects
that
polar
ice
cream
and
creamery
is
the
largest
--
one
of
the
largest
independent
milk
dealers
certainly
in
the
south.
and
as
a
practical
problem,
there
are
very
few
companies
that
are
able
to
bid
on
a
contract
of
this
magnitude
that
i
think
is
--
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
and
then
the
last
of
portion
of
our
brief
is
consider
the
question
of
whether
or
not
florida
can
impose
a
distributor's
tax
of
15
cents
per
100
gallons
on
all
of
the
milk
which
is
delivered
to
the
military.
our
position
is
squarely
this
that
certainly
on
these
military
installations,
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
which
it
has
been
seeded
to
the
united
states,
florida
is
without
jurisdiction
to
impose
that
tax
on
the
distributor
because
the
tax
is
leveled
upon
sales
made
by
the
distributor
and
the
impact
would
have
necessity
fall
on
the
government.
it
would
increase
the
price
of
milk
and
also
--
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that
is
correct.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that
is
correct
your
honor.
and
so
polar
contends
that
florida
is
without
jurisdiction
because
the
same
situation
found
here
is
the
situation
which
was
found
in
pacific
coast
dairy
of
course
at
market
field
and
also
with
respect
to
the
installations
in
all
cases.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that
comes
under
the
--
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that
comes
under
the
--
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
three
--
the
third,
the
third
question.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
on
page
41.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
of
our
main
brief.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
on
page
41.
but
excuse
me
that
--
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
yes
sir
that's
the
one,
page
41.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
no
sir
because
the
third.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
yes,
it's
related
to
both
points
but
the
third
--
the
third
point,
it
seems
that
we
would
be
on
extremely
solid
ground
and
that
i've
been
unable
to
find
any
cases
which
would
call
this
court
--
which
would
indicate
that
this
court
has
departed
from
the
position
which
has
always
taken
down
through
the
years
and
that
is
--
the
cession
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
course
means
just
that
unless
there
was
a
saving
clause
and
therefore,
the
state
was
without
jurisdiction
to
levy
the
tax.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
so
that
the
--
i
hope
i
made
myself
clear
with
respect
to
the
three
issues
as
we
understand
them.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
the
tax
goes
to
the
support
of
the
milk
commission,
yes
sir.
and
before
i
sit
down,
i
would
like
before
the
court
to
understand
that
this
is
a
little
different,
however,
from
a
tax
which
is
an
inspection
tax
with
respect
to
purity
or
wholesomeness
of
that
or
anything
of
that
sort,
chapter
501
does
not
touched
on
the
purity
or
the
wholesomeness
of
milk
and
that
is
with
--
that
is
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
department
of
agriculture
in
the
state
of
florida.
and
of
course
501
is
only
interested
in
the
economic
aspects
insofar
as
the
regulation
of
milk
is
concern.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
yes,
he
was.
he
did
not
feel
that
it
would
be
the
best
interest
of
the
milk
industry
or
the
dairy.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
let
me
direct
myself
just
to
that
--
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
--
particular
situation
a
moment
that
the
base
of
course
is
certainly
percentage
situation
of
class
i
sales.
it's
not
only
gallon
into
basis
and
the
percentage
totals
up
to
100%
of
class
i,
that's
exactly
the
point
sir.
in
other
words,
it
--
it's
a
hot
--
it's
a
percentage
not
a
gallonage
so
that
so
long
supposed
that
--
supposed
that
his
class
i
sales
would
have
doubled,
nevertheless,
that
percentage
would
shift
upward
so
that
if
mr.
(inaudible)
who
was
the
first
producer
named
in
the
record
had
8.67%
for
his
base
--
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that's
right.
then
instead
of
him
being
at
that
same
level,
he
would
have
doubled
the
amount
but
the
percentage
would
remain
the
same
and
there's
the
base
in
the
thing.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
no
question
about
it.
their
law
says
it
and
--
and
if
it's
absolutely
the
truth.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that
--
that
is
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
and
i
don't
want
to
get
off
on
something
that's
not
pertinent
but
this
is
very
pertinent
and
that
is
that
this
base
could
be
transferred
so
that
conceivably
you
see
to
a
bigger
dairy.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
if
the
milk
put
--
if
the
milk
commission
approved
it,
they
could
transfer
that
to
another
bigger
dairy
and
he
would
have
to
take
ever
increasing
quantities
of
milk.
and
i
want
to
correct
something
that
i
said
here
this
morning
by
any
plaintiffs
and
i
want
to
apologize.
i
said
the
case
with
just
cause,
was
the
odham
case.
the
odham
case
which
is
reported
in
121
so.2d
625,
considered
the
same
problem
but
it
was
the
case
which
made
the
milk
commission
go
to
the
legislature
and
have
the
just
cause
redefined
so
that
the
case
that
considers
that
squarely
and
says
that
he
cannot
terminate
that
relationship
without
just
cause
is
florida
dairy
versus
florida
milk
commission
reported
at
a
149
so.2d,
867.
and
i
cite
that
at
page
23
of
our
main
brief,
so
i
did
want
to
clear
that
up
but
they
--
they
touch
on
the
both
--
on
the
same
problem
but
this
later
case
was
after
the
legislature
had
amended
this
to
see
that
they
could
not
terminate
the
relationship
without
just
cause.
and
the
point
that
rose
in
that
was
the
distributor
came
in
and
said
he
was
losing
money
and
he
wanted
to
terminate
the
relationship.
and
the
court
said,
“no,
there's
been
no
abuse
of
discretion
because
sufficient
just
cause
has
not
been
shown
even
though
you
are
losing
money
by
having
to
take
this
milk
from
them,
you
cannot
terminate
the
relationship
so
that
there
is
another
part
of
the
same
scheme
that
forces
a
milk
distributor
into
a
permanent
marriage
which
he
cannot
terminate
except
upon
the
milk
commission
giving
him
the
permission
so
to
do
and
he
--
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
i
feel
sure
that
he
could.
the
testimony
says
that
he
could.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
well,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
the
record
guild
the
figures
of
the
milk
which
he
himself
purchased
from
black
dairy's
from
these
other
places
he
supplies
and
for
the
month
of
november
1961
and
they
give
the
gallonage
so
that
he
shows
exactly
how
his
business
was
run.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that's
70%
is
correct,
that
you
--
that
is
correct
--
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
i'm
only
speaking
from
the
record
he
said
that
it
was
not.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
yes
sir,
i
would
like
to
straighten
you
out
and
there
again,
instead
of
conjecture
--
if
we
will
go
to
the
record,
i
think
that
might
be
heavy.
the
administrator
of
the
milk
commission,
mr.
fisher,
testified
at
pages
147
and
148
of
the
record,
that
if
he
uses
florida
milk
for
the
military,
it
would
be
class
i
and
he
would
pay
61
cents
a
gallon.
and
the
next
question
was,
“you
know
that's
true?”
and
mr.
fisher
says,
“yes,
i
know
it
and
you
do
too.”
mr.
fisher
was
the
administrator
of
the
florida
milk
commission.
he
was
the
headman
in-charge
and
that
is
as
clear
as
the
record
can
be.
so
that
leaves
us
with
this.
your
question
mr.
justice
white,
all
throughout
this
argument,
has
been
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
any
requirement
if
a
gallon
of
florida
milk
goes
into
the
military
to
pay
61
cents
for
it.
that
has
been
as
i
understand
the
problem.
and
i
tell
you
that
the
record
says
exactly
that's
what
is
required
to
be.
now,
there's
nothing
--
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
not
a
thing
and
there's
nothing
in
this
record
about
they
can
make
some
sort
of
negotiated
contract.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
well,
here
--
here
is
the
reason.
i
want
to
clear
that
up
for
you.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
alright,
let
me
--
let
me
tell
you
how
this
came
about.
there
was
a
proposed
military
order
which
they
talked
about
but
the
producers
voted
not
to
be
bound
by
that
so
that
that
automatically
took
that
out
of
the
case
and
left
in
the
61
cents
price.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
insofar
as
the
pensacola
area
is
concerned,
there
is
not.
so
that
the
only
order
and
the
only
requirement
for
military
milk
used
in
the
pensacola
area
is
61
cents
a
gallon.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that
is
not
absolutely
correct.
they
say
this.
the
testimony
says
that
insofar
as
the
military
milk
is
concerned,
you
don't
have
to
use
florida
milk.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
if
you
use
florida
milk,
you
pay
61
cents
per
gallon.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that's
right.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
no,
there
is
not.
that's
right
--
for
--
for
the
military.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
no
sir
it's
not.
i
don't
find
it
in
the
record.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
exactly.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
that's
right.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
i'm
frank
to
say
that
the
record
is
devoid
of
that
particular
subject
because
if
the
milk
commission
took
the
position
that
because
the
producers
voted
down
the
military
milk
order
in
effect
that
the
only
thing
logically
to
draw
from
that
was
that
military
milk
was
of
no
concern
in
this
case,
that
is
the
position
make
taken
today.
but
yet,
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is
if
you
use
a
gallon
of
florida
milk
for
our
good
florida
boys
based
at
the
pensacola
naval
air
station,
you
must
pay
61
cents
a
gallon
for
it.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
if
you
use
--
that
--
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
as
i
say,
the
record
is
devoid
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
yes
sir,
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
help
you
and
i
say
that
that's
their
position
and
so
far
as
any
order
of
the
military
--
order
that
polar
used
florida
milk
for
the
military,
there
is
none,
to
answer
you
directly.
mr.
joe
j.
harrell
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
there's
only
one
other
thing.
there've
been
several
references
that
polar
is
paying
the
same
price
to
producers
that
after
the
milk
commission
came
in
that
he
paid
the
four.
that
is
incorrect
in
our
site
for
--
so
that
the
court
will
understand
that
page.
the
record
at
page
135
which
clearly
said
that
and
that
is
this,
61
cents
was
paid
only
for
an
agreed
amount
of
milk
and
all
over
that
amount
of
milk
which
was
furnished
by
these
producers
we're
paying
for
at
$4
a
hundred
weight
or
35.5
cents
per
gallon.
so
that's
a
big
difference
as
opposed
to
the
contention,
otherwise
and
the
record
bears
that
out
and
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention.
another
thing
is
this,
the
court
might
have
some
puzzle
as
to
how
could
--
how
did
this
problem
arise
now
when
opposing
counsel
said
the
milk
commission
had
previously
been
in
the
pensacola
area
and
then
was
out
of
the
area.
the
answer
to
that
is
this.
this
is
the
first
time
since
the
establishment
of
the
milk
commission
that
there's
ever
been
a
base
system
of
allocation
which
takes
that
pensacola
area.
this
was
the
first
time.
and
when
they
were
in
the
milk
commission
--
when
the
milk
commission
was
in
before,
there
was
never
a
based
allocation
system
and
of
course
that's
the
whole
bias
of
the
thing.
and
i
think
this
court
safely
understands
it
and
i
appreciate
your
time.
