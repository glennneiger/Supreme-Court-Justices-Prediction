justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
brown
was
the
physician
of
defense
counsel
was
in
the
light
of
the
commitment
there
could
be
no
appeal
until
after
the
procedures
have
been
completed
required
by
that
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
am
just
wondering
whether
there
is
anything
in
that
colloquy
with
the
judge
from
which
it
appears
that
he
had
the
view
that
whether
he
welcomed
it
or
not,
but
if
he
went
along
with
it
that
he
could
not
appeal
until
after
the
procedure
had
been
completed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
suggest
that
you
had
a
very
good
ground
of
appeal
i
suppose
you
might
have
a
case
where
it's
an
open
shut
case
for
reversal,
why
would
defense
counsel
want
his
client
to
be
incarcerated
for
six
months
if
he's
got
an
open
shut
down
on
which
the
conviction
would
be
reversed
and
his
client
could
go
free?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
was
rather
formal
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
the
way
mr.
brown
i
got
your
argument
to
us,
there
was
no
final
judgment
which
is
appealable
until
this
procedure
had
been
completed
and
therefore
he
had
to
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
conviction
in
face
to
the
commitment
you
do
had
a
premature
appeal,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
got
to
decide
whether
--
when
is
the
final
judgment
from
which
you
had
to
take
an
appeal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
says
no
i
would
counter
appeal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
can
insist
on
it
that
i
would
suppose
this
contemplates
that
the
court
could
insist
that
he
shall
undergo
this
procedure.
