mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
at
the
outset
i
should
mention
to
the
court
as
i
think
chief
justice
probably
knows
as
the
chairman
of
the
judicial
conference,
there
are
presently
two
bills
pending
before
the
congress,
identical
bills,
one
in
the
senate,
one
in
the
house,
which
would
resolve
both
the
problem
in
this
case,
the
question
of
when
the
appeal
time
begins
to
run
and
also
the
question
in
the
following
case,
in
behrens
case,
whether
the
defendants
reappearance
at
the
modification
of
sentence
is
required.
we
have
no
assurance
that
these
bills
will
be
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
--
it
would
resolve
the
question
as
the
government
urges
its
present
law.
nothing
in
the
provisions
of
this
subsection
shall
preclude
the
defendant
from
being
admitted
to
bail
pending
appeal
of
certiorari
and
the
right
to
appeal
shall
run
from
the
date
the
original
sentence
was
imposed
under
subsection
(b)
of
this
section.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
hearings,
i
understand
had
been
heard
--
have
been
held
on
the
house
side.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
testified
favorably.
the
department
of
justice
has
recommended
to
the
senate
committee
to
have
such
bills.
the
judicial
conference
of
the
united
states
has
approved
the
bill,
that's
still
notified
both
committees
as
i
understand.
however--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
not
mr.
chief
justice.
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
should
say
that
while
the
judicial
conference's
proposal
use
the
word
tentative
unless
one
reads
that
as
an
indication
there
was
no
other
statement
in
the
judicial
conference
proposal
or
in
their
recommendation
to
the
congress
which
would
indicate
that
they
viewed
the
appeal
as
running
from
the
final
rather
than
the
tentative
sentence
as
they
put
it.
they
may
have
used
the
word
tentative
which
in
some
respects
is
quite
accurate
as
characterizing
the
initial
commitment.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
certainly
is
necessary
we
think
for
the
defendant
to
be
in
incarcerated
in
order
for
the
study
to
be
completed.
there
is
no
reason
however
why
that
cannot
occur
after
the
appeal
is
completed
if
the
defendant
chooses
to
exercise
his
right
to
bail
pending
appeal.
on
the
other
hand
if
the
defendant
prefers
to
begin
serving
his
sentence
and
goes
to
the
penitentiary,
we
see
no
reason
why
the
study
cannot
go
forward.
and
while
there
is
a
problem
with
reference
to
the
judges
imposing
the
final
sentence
while
the
appeal
is
pending,
we
accept
the
suggestion
which
mr.
justice
white
has
made
that
section
4208
(b)
amends
that
rule,
the
extent
that
that
rule
was
still
a
viable
rule
by
impliedly
permitting
the
judge
to
re-sentence
even
though
the
appeal
is
proceeding
on
the
ground
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
do.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
study
would
be
postponed.
in
fact
we
think
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
appeal
must
be
from
the
initial
judgment
is
that
the
right
to
bail
would
otherwise
be
in
jeopardy.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
all
i
would
say
is,
with
reference
to
the
present
law
that
this
amendment
is
labeled
a
clarified
amendment.
we
view
it
is
not
changing
the
law
in
any
way,
simply
as
being
more
explicit.
i
might
say
here
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
he
might
--
there
are
really
two
questions
mr.
justice
white,
one
whether
he
chooses
to
exercise
his
right
to
be
enlarged
on
bail
and
the
second
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
then
he
is
in
custody
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
his
right
to
bail
would
be
denied,
that
is
we
say
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
think
the
appeal
must
come
first,
because
we
--
for
most
defendants,
this
defendant
being
an
exception
and
he
apparently
was
willing
to
submit
to
custody
for
three
to
six
months
without
exercising
his
right
of
appeal,
most
defendants
we
think
would
want
or
at
least
would
have
a
right
to
choose
to
exercise
their
right
to
be
enlarged
on
bail
and
to
defer
actual
punishment
until
merits
of
the
appeal
were
determined.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
true
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
appeal
does
in
fact
sometimes
depend
on
the
sentence
actually
imposed.
we
don't
view
there
is
any
difficult
on
the
appeal
because
the
court
of
appeal
will
know
that
the
sentence
originally
imposed
here,
the
375
years,
is
nearly
tentative
and
they
will
defer
consideration
of
any
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
argument
to
the
re-sentencing
at
which
time
the
question
will
remain
open
under
a
2255
motion
or
a
motion
to
vacate
an
illegal
sentence
under
the
first
part
of
rule
35.
you
don't
contemplate
that
there
will
be
any
necessity
for
second
appeal
because
of
course
the
judge
is
not
going
to
affirm
the
375
year
sentence.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
it
is
only
in
the
rarest
case
that
the
severity
of
the
sentence
is
subject
to
inquiry
upon
appeal
in
the
first
place.
if
sometimes
the
sentence
is
so
outrageous
that
it
does
amount
to
so
disproportionate
to
the
offence
it
does
amount
to
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
that
rare
case,
we
suggest,
can
be
adequately
handled
by
subsequent
collateral
proceeding
or
a
rule
35
proceeding
if
the
judge
should
adhere
to
the
outrageous
sentence
which
of
course
did
not
in
this
case.
here
the
375
years
sentence
was
reduced
to
probation.
now,
i
think
your
honor
was
also
suggesting
that
some
defendant
for
fear
of
what
they
ultimate
sentence
will
be
may
appeal
while
if
they
knew
that
they
were
ultimately
going
to
be
placed
on
probation
they
would
forgo
the
appeal,
that
is
--
and
it's
probably
true.
we
do
suggest
that
most
defendants
appeal
not
with
reference
to
the
extent
of
sentence
imposed,
but
as
they
should
in
order
to
assert
their
innocence
or
to
assert
that
they
were
only
convicted
and
this
consideration
is
not
affected
by
the
sentence
actually
imposed.
i
think
this
case
is
a
particular
illustration
of
that.
the
defendant
here
was
in
fact
placed
on
probation
and
nevertheless
appeals
or
he
makes
the
argument
if
your
honor
suggests
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
they
are
alarmed,
many
defendants
who
do
appeal
in
order
to
clear
their
name
if
words
of
this
particular
(inaudible)
and
who
want
to
remove
the
stigma
of
the
conviction.
if
we
must
choose
between
the
man
who
claims
his
absolute
innocence
and
wants
to
appeal
regardless
of
sentence
and
he
had
in
fact
been
wrongly
convicted
and
question
was
referenced
to
him
of
whether
he
should
be
made
to
go
to
the
penitentiary
first
to
wait
three
to
six
months
before
wrong
and
(inaudible)
and
then
to
spend
that
time
serving
punishment
which
is
what
happens
if
he
were
to
await,
he
is
allowed
to
be
put
in
to
operation.
if
we
must
balance
concerns
for
that
man
against
the
man
whose
appeal
depends
on
whether
the
thing
it
worthwhile
in
view
of
the
sentence
we
think
we
have
to
prefer
the
first
man.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
of
course
is
correct
your
honor,
but
the
defendant
when
appealing
asserts
perhaps
the
evidence
isn't
sufficient
to
convict
him,
he
puts
it
in
that
legal
framework
but
surely
what
he
is
saying
is
that
i
was
innocent.
all
right
then
if
he
says
i
am
not
innocent,
but
i
was
wrongly
convicted.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
whether
he
said
so
or
not
mr.
justice
stewart
i
suggest
that
he
maybe
innocent
or
he
may
have
been
wrongly
convicted.
in
either
case
he
is
entitled
to
a
process
reversal.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
a
step
in
order
to
attain
restitution
if
that's
appropriate.
he
must
actually
prove
his
innocence
under
relatively
new
provision
of
the
court
of
claims
act
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice
i
hope
that
there
are
rare
instances
in
which
the
judge
will
hold
it
against
the
defendant
that
he
has
appealed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
would
point
out
that
the
same
problem
is
raised
by
this
court's
holding
in
korematsu.
there
the
imposition
of
sentence
was
differed
and
then
was
placed
on
probation.
this
court
held
that
he
might
nevertheless
appeal.
on
a
revocation
of
probation
the
judge
might
if
he
was
so
he
can't
hold
it
against
him
that
he
had
pursued
the
matter
further
by
appeal
and
yet
he
is
perfectly
free
for
the
first
time
to
impose
any
sentence
which
would
be
illegal
for
the
original
sentence,
not
a
sentence
for
the
violation
of
probation
but
a
sentence
of
the
original
offence.
i
suggest
that
the
weight
or
consideration
is
the
notion
of
our
law
that
a
man
should
not
be
made
to
wait
to
test
his
conviction,
rightness
of
this
conviction
by
review
at
least
he
should
not
be
made
to
begin
serving
actual
punishment
until
he
has
fully
exercised
his
right
to
review
on
appeal
and
that
is
impossible
to
avoid
if
the
appeal
must
wait
until
reconsideration
and
re-sentencing.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
might
be
very
desirable
result
mr.
justice
goldberg.
off
hand
i
can
see
no
objection
to
it
because
then
the
man's
serving
a
portion
of
his
sentence
would
be
voluntary
at
his
own
option.
however,
as
the
law
stands
i
hear
no
suggestions
from
the
petitioner.
i
see
no
possibility
in
the
statutes
to
call
a
judgment
final
at
the
option
of
the
appellant.
i
am
afraid
it
must
be
final
or
not
and
while
the
congress
i
should
think
would
be
perfectly
free
to
adopt
that
suggestion
if
it
had
not
felt
so
and
even
the
present
legislation
did
not
pose
that
solution.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
grant
your
honor
that
congress
should
have
been
more
cautious
and
should
have
included
the
word
ultimately
to
be
imposed.
later
on,
however,
in
the
same
section
we
have
indication
to
go
the
other
way.
this
is
the
alternative
the
judge
has
affirmed
the
sentence
of
imprisonment
originally
imposed,
clearly
talking
about
a
sentence
already
imposed.
i
do
think
it's
clear
from
the
legislative
history
of
this
provision
that
congress
had
in
mind
that
this
second
sentencing,
this
reconsideration
which
i
emphasize
can
only
be
a
reduction
was
to
be
treated
in
the
light
of
rule
35.
it
was
a
modification
of
an
original
sentence
already
imposed.
i
would
add,
however,
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
finality
of
judgment
and
appealability
the
korematsu
case
i
should
think
resolves
this
problem
fully.
there
no
sentence
whatever
was
imposed
and
yet
because
discipline
was
imposed
the
court
held
that
the
time
for
appeal
that
appeal
was
allowed
from
the
order
granting
probation.
i
distinguish
between
the
suspension
of
execution
of
sentence
and
the
suspension
of
imposition
of
sentence.
they
are
very
clearly,
i
think
i'm
correct
in
saying
mr.
justice
black
was
the
author
of
opinion,
it
was
unanimous.
the
court
found
the
difficulty
because
no
sentence
whatever
in
the
strict
sense
had
been
imposed
the
statute
expressively
saying,
execution
of
sentence,
imposition
of
sentence
had
been
suspended
and
yet
an
appealable
judgment,
judgment
being
the
termination
of
guilt
and
the
immediate
commitment
of
the
prisoner
to,
in
this
case
the
penitentiary
there
to
the
discipline
of
probation
was
sufficient
to
support
an
appeal.
finally,
i
would
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
one
of
the
progenitors
of
this
statute,
which
had
explicitly
provided
that
the
appeal
should
run
from
the
initial
sentence.
this
was
a
proposal
on
the
judicial
conference.
it's
shown
on
page
19
and
20
of
our
brief
in
the
following
case.
this
is
little
awkward,
but
i
will,
since
it
isn't
a
brief
in
this
case,
i
will
read
that
proposal,
certain
portion
of
the
proposal,
this
is
in
1943
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
pages
19
and
20
of
the
brief
in
behrens
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
not
this
case,
the
behrens
case.
when
an
offender
has
appealed
from
a
judgment
of
conviction
and
elects
to
enter
upon
the
service
of
his
original
sentence,
the
definite
sentence
maybe
fixed
notwithstanding
the
pendency
of
the
appeal.
unfortunately
between
1943
and
1958,
this
problem
was
apparently
overlooked
and
this
provision
was
not
carried
forward.
it
would
have
solved
both
the
question
that
mr.
justice
white
mentioned
at
the
opening
of
the
argument,
the
possibility
for
the
court
to
impose
the
final
sentence
notwithstanding
the
pendency
of
an
appeal
at
the
same
time
making
a
perfectly
clear
that
the
appeal
read
from
the
original
judgment
and
not
from
the
subsequent
judgment.
in
conclusion,
i
want
to
emphasize
again
that
if
this
is
a
question
of
balancing
interests
of
defendants,
i
think
we
must
prefer,
we
must
be
more
concerned
for
the
right
of
the
defendant
who
asserts
perhaps
not
his
innocence,
but
the
wrongness
of
his
conviction
and
claims
a
right
to
have
that
matter
tested
promptly
and
without
the
imposition
of
punishment
in
the
meantime
you
must
prefer
his
claim
over
that
of
the
man
who
says
i
prefer
to
wait
and
see
what
my
sentence
is
before
i
appeal.
on
those
grounds
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
afraid
that
is
true
though
i
would
think
if
the
--
it
would
be
a
limited
additional
burden
and
perhaps
the
solution
to
it
is
that
justice
goldberg
though
i
suggest
that
solution
is
one
that's
addressed
to
the
congress
to
provide
an
election.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
our
information
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
since
1958
when
this
statute
first
came
into
operation,
the
use
of
it
increased
quite
markedly
through
last
year
at
which
time
it
was
invoked
in
something
over
3%
of
the
cases
in
which
–
it
is
still
very
small
figure.
we
had
told
that
during
the
last
fiscal
year
the
use
of
it
did
not
diminish,
but
did
not
increase.
one
of
the
reasons
for
that
it
was
a
doubt
as
to
the
two
questions
presented
here,
the
question
of
when
the
appeal
begins
to
run,
the
question
of
whether
the
defendant
had
to
be
returned
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
these
matters
were
suggested
to
be
clarified
in
the
pending
legislation.
it
might
be
also
interesting
to
note
that
our
figures
reflect
that
the
recommendation
of
the
prison
authorities
is
followed
by
the
judge
in
something
over
80%
of
the
cases
that
a
reduction
in
sentence
from
the
original
sentence
occurs
in
approximately
85%
of
the
cases
or
perhaps
somewhat
more
and
that
in
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
that
is
--
that
is
great,
but
the
act,
the
cases
in
which
the
original
sentence
is
affirmed
only
amount
to
about
13%
and
most
of
those
are
direct
cases
in
which
the
maximum
sentence
is
relatively
light,
five
years.
probation
is
granted
on
the
basis
of
the
most
recent
year
available
in
something
like
21%
of
the
cases
on
the
ultimate
disposition
over
that.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
the
percentage
is
considerably
high,
i'm
sorry
i
don't
have
any
accurate
figures.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no
i
think
that
includes
(a)
(1)
and
(a)
(2);
(a)
(1)
commits
the
judge
to
set
the
date
the
eligibility
for
that
rule
and
anytime
less
than
one
third;
(a)
(2)
which
i
think
is
more
often
used
allows
the
board
of
parole
to
release
the
man
at
anytime.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
without
limitation.
for
these
reasons
we
submit
the
judgment
of
the
court
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
know
of
only
three
cases
in
which
the
appeal
was
not
taken
from
the
original
commitment.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
where
appeal
is
taken
that
we
cite
two
cases
in
which
pending
appeal,
the
sentence
had
been
modified,
we
cite
those
cases
in
our
brief
in
behrens.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no
certainly
not,
not
on
the
basis
of
the
actual
expense.
