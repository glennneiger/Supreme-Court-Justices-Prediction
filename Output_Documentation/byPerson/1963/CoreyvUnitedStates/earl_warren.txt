number
31,
benjamin
w.
corey,
petitioner,
versus
united
states.
mr.
brown
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
will
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
claiborne.
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
those
progressed
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
the
house
side?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
claiborne
it
was
originally
passed
to
the
conference
of
the
other
rule,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
the
report
they
made
to
the
--
the
congress
was,
it
wouldn't
be
primal
until
he,
until
the
final
sentence.
i
may
be
mistaken
--.
i
see
mr.
brown
shaking
his
head
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
you
going
to
take
that
up
with
you
on
your
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
excuse
me
mr.
claiborne,
you
go
right
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
clearer
and
another
practical
factor
and
the
same
too.
there
are
several
judges
i
have
known
number
of
them
myself
who
will
not
consider
the
probation
or
clemency
on
their
part
unless
they
believe
that
a
man
is
(inaudible)
and
if
he
pleads
not
guilty
and
stands
a
jury
trial
and
particularly
if
he
pursues
it
on
appeal,
they
are
of
the
opinion
that
he
hasn't
the
first
qualification
for
probation
and
they
just
won't
consider.
now,
if
you
are
up
against
the
judge
of
that
kind
a
man
would
be
very
worried
about
the
taking
an
appeal
at
that
stage
of
the
proceeding
in
a
number
of
years
he
was
going
to
be
in
prison
depended
upon
on
what
that
judge
thought
of
him
after
he
made
this
survey.
i
wonder
if
that
wouldn't
deter
a
lot
of
men
who
might
have
good
ground
for
appeal
from,
from
appealing
for
--
of
the
affect
it
would
have
on
the
judge's
action.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
might
hope
that
but
it
isn't
the
fact
i
have
experienced
it
many
times
through
the
years.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
claiborne
how
do
you
dispose
this
the
first
sentence
of
section
that
we're
concerned
with,
4208
(b),
where
it
says
if
the
court
desires
more
detailed
information
as
a
basis
for
determining
the
sentence
to
be
imposed,
the
court
may
commit
the
defendant.
now
doesn't
that
--
doesn't
that
indicate
that
the
sentence
is
not
final.
if
the
court
desires
more
detailed
information
as
a
basis
for
determining
the
sentence
to
be
imposed,
the
court
may
commit
the
defendant
and
so
forth.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
claiborne,
have
you
any
idea
how
much
this
section
is
used
and
how
much
it
is
progressing
in
use
if
that
is
the
fact.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
brown.
chief
justice
earl
warren
these
studies
are
made
by
the
prison
authorities.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
couldn't
very
well
be
made
at
some
(inaudible)
custody.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
