mr.
russell
morton
brown
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
this
case
involves
an
application
for
the
court
to
exercise
it
supervisory
jurisdiction
really
over
the
actions
of
the
districts
courts
in
applying
a
fairly
new
statute
which
has
been
referred
to
as
the
federal
sentencing
act
of
1958.
this
particular
case
involves
the
right
of
one
individual
to
appeal
and
the
decision
of
this
court
will
determine
whether
he
will
have
an
opportunity
to
appeal
or
not,
there
are
other
cases
that
will
certainly
be
governed
by
this
court's
ruling
and
we
have
asked
the
court
to
pass
upon
the
single
question
of
what
constitutes
a
final
judgment
in
a
criminal
proceeding
where
the
court
invokes
the
authority,
given
by
the
new
statute,
to
secure
further
information
as
a
basis
for
determining
the
sentence
to
be
imposed.
of
course
the
usual
practice
is
to
permit
the
defendant
to
continue
at
the
liberty
under
the
bail,
or
if
he
is
not
under
bail
and
remains
in
custody,
but
to
pass
no
final
sentence
until
a
probation
officer
can
submit
a
report
for
the
court's
guidance.
at
this
point
the
--
there
is
no
sentence
whatsoever
imposed.
in
the
case
at
bar,
i
should
tell
the
court
the
defendant
on
trial
is
a
member
of
the
massachusetts
bar,
an
individual
with
an
outstanding
record
of
service
in
both
world
war
ii
and
in
the
korean
conflict
and
man
who
experienced
some
psychiatric
difficulty
and
was
at
the
time
this
case
took
place
considered
to
have
some
psychiatric
disability
connected
with
his
military
service.
he
had
practiced
law
and
had
returned
from
a
korean
war
and
had
gotten
into
a
business
of
selling
scientific
instruments
to
some
of
the
massachusetts
scientific
establishments
like
mit
university
and
harvard
and
some
of
the
government
establishments
up
there.
it
developed
that
the
purchasing
agent
at
one
of
the
government
installations
the
watertown
massachusetts
arsenal
was
being
investigated
for
shortages
in
the
inventory
of
materials
and
parts
that
he
was
supposed
to
have
on
hand
and
he
involved
a
large
number
of
purchase
merchants
said
that
he
had
never
received
this
merchandise
but
had
simply
agreed
with
these
merchants
of
whom
the
defendant
and
petitioner
here
was
one,
to
submit
invoices
which
he
would
approve
as
being
correct
and
he
would
see
that
they
were
paid
and
then
divide
the
proceeds
with
these
merchants.
this
petitioner
pleaded
not
guilty
along
with
all
the
others,
i
beg
you
pardon.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
would
say
approximately
$5000
over
a
period
of
some
time
and
involving
75
invoices,
so
there
were
75
counts
involved.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
believe
that's
correct,
it
was
a
relatively
small
amount
and
the
very
smallness
of
the
amount
is
one
of
the
points
that
would
be
raised
on
appeal
if
we
were
able
to
appeal,
because
evidence
was
rejected
which
showed
that
there
would
have
been
no
profit
at
all
to
this
defendant
under
the
circumstances
of
the
small
amount.
however,
in
the
course
of
the
trial
i
should
tell
the
court
that
this
petitioner
was
the
first
and
only
one
to
be
tried
under
these
indictments,
there
were
a
number
of
indictments,
because
these
are
all
pleaded
guilty
after
he
was
convicted,
he
went
to
trial,
pleaded
not
guilty
took
the
stand
in
his
own
defense.
there
are
matters
of
law
that
we
feel
and
i
personally
will
represent
to
the
court
that
the
questions
sought
to
be
raised
on
appeal
are
of
substance
and
are
not
frivolous
by
any
means.
they
involve
for
one
thing
an
instruction
of
the
court
to
the
jury
as
to
the
conclusion
i
might
draw
from
a
reported
conversation
between
an
fbi
agent
and
this
petitioner.
we
feel
that
the
court
erroneously
instructed
the
jury
as
to
the
deduction
i
might
draw
from
that.
second
there
is
some
serious
question
about
the
propriety
of
submitting
the
case
to
the
jury
on
the
uncorroborated
testimony
of
an
accomplice,
particularly
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
now
i
am
not
unaware
of
our
federal
rule
that
a
conviction
may
stand
on
that
basis,
but
we
seek
to
raise
for
the
court's
consideration,
that
is
the
court
of
appeals'
consideration
plus
we
eventually
hear
the
propriety
of
a
conviction
which
rests
upon
the
particular
peculiar
circumstances
of
this
case
where
there
was
possibly
evidence
of
an
exculpatory
nature
in
the
possession
of
the
prosecution
and
so
on.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
no,
your
honor,
they
are
not,
mr.
justice
clark.
i
simply
mention
so
the
court
will
feel
and
realize
that
there
are
matters
of
substance
which
we
seek
to
raise
on
the
appeal
and
which
we
haven't
been
permitted
to
present
at
all.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
not
at
all,
not
at
all
but
if
the
questions
that
we
sought
to
rise
were
of
privilege
nature.
i
wouldn't,
yes
thank
you
your
honor.
now
the
point
that
i
must
invite
the
court's
attention
to
here
is
particularly
the
fact
that
after
the
jury
had
concluded
that
the
defendant
was
guilty
and
matter
came
on
for
a
sentencing,
the
court
said
i
have
no
complete
probation
report
and
i
don't
know
what
to
do.
at
that
point
we
can
tell
this
in
the
brief
they
have
set
forth
verbatim.
the
defense
counsel,
a
very
able
and
distinguished
boston
lawyer
presented
a
physician
of
the
veterans
administration
testify
to
the
psychiatric
condition
of
this
defendant
to
testify
that
he
had
been
in
the
veterans
administration
hospital
under
care
and
discussed
the
desirability
of
continuing
treatment
without
incarceration.
at
this
point
the
court,
judge
floyd,
a
very
distinguished
boston
district
judge,
said
he
was
uncertain
as
to
what
to
do
that
he
had
decided
that
after
some
enquiry
and
this
was
at
a
second
hearing
on
sentencing
that
he
would,
like
to
know
more
about
this
defendant
than
he
had
known
up
to
that
time
and
he
was
aware
that
this
federal
sentencing
act
authorized
him
to
consult
with
or
secure
advise
and
recommendations
from
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
here
in
washington.
accordingly
he
said,
he
proposed
to
sentence
the
defendant
under
section
4208(b)
of
title
18.
now
this
statute
says
if
the
court
desires
more
information
before
determining
the
sentence
to
be
imposed
it
may
commit
the
defendant
to
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general
for
a
period
not
to
exceed
90
days
unless
he
extends
it
for
another
90
days
and
at
that
point
the
bureau
of
federal
prisons
shall
report
and
make
its
recommendations.
he
said
i
think
they
have
the
specialists
to
help
me
and
i'd
like
to
have
their
advice.
it's
very
important
i
think
in
the
context
of
this
case
to
notice
that
he
addressed
himself
to
the
defense
counsel
at
that
point
and
said
are
you
with
4208(b)
and
the
lawyer
said,
i
have
just
read
it,
your
honor,
i
consider
it
a
commitment
for
treatment
for
90
days.
the
court
said
yes.
united
states
attorney
didn't
say
anything
although
he
was
present
and
it
was
he
who
initiated
the
discussion
of
4208(b).
in
other
words,
what
we
deduce
from
this
is,
no
one
consider
this
a
disposition
of
the
case,
but
just
a
reference
to
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
psychiatric
studies
and
evaluations.
now
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
mr.
justice
brennan
at
that
time
i
believe
the
defense
counsel
was
very
happy
to
have
this
psychiatric
study
made,
because
he
realized
that
it
would
show
the
condition
of
the
defendant
would
enable
court
to
take
that
in
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
mr.
justice
brennan,
there
was
no
discussion
of
appeal
at
that
point
at
all.
apparently
no
consideration
was
given
to
it.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well
that's
a
very
pertinent
question
and
i
am
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well,
not
only
that
mr.
justice
clark,
but
it
isn't
six
months,
it's
nine,
it's
90
days,
unless
the
court
extends
it.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes
i
agree,
i
agree
thoroughly
and
i
am
glad
to
address
myself
to
that
point,
because
it's
pertinent.
now
take
the
position
as
mr.
justice
clark
says,
you
never
know
for
sure,
but
getting
a
reversal,
i
mean
you
may,
sometimes
we
have,
we
cut
off
the
(inaudible)
to
quite
a
degree
that,
but
we
take
it
from
this
standpoint.
let's
assume
that
rather
than
risk
the
sentence
which
might
be
very
severe.
as
in
this
case
it
was
375
years
under
the
statute
that
he
was
sentenced
to,
that
is
as
the
matter
of
law.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes
pro-forma
certainly,
but
the
point
is
that
with
90
days
in
federal
custody
the
court
might
welcome
to
the
conclusion
that
they
should
be
released
for
hospitalization
and
treatment
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case.
the
court
admitted
him
to
probation
i'd
have
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well,
i
would
say
that
you
would
have
this
to
loose
mr.
justice
white
the
court
will
assume,
would
say
you're
committed
to
the
custody
of
attorney
general,
you
don't
appeal.
now
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
or
you
take
your
appeal
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well,
i
think
you
have
to
take
cognizance
mr.
justice
white
of
the
fact
that
appeals
are
expensive.
they
require
a
tremendous
amount
of
work.
many
defendants
do
not
have
the
funds
to
finance
this
sort
of
thing.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well
it
comes
to
a
case
of
balancing
the
conveniences
in
that
sort
of
situation
i
suppose.
man
who
sentenced
to
five
years
might
say
i'm
going
to
appeal
and
he'll
go
to
extremes
and
his
family
will
maybe
to
get
the
money
for
an
appeal.
on
the
other
hand
a
fellow
who
is
going
to
do
90
days
and
come
out
on
probation,
they
don't
want
to
spend
the
money,
i
suppose.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
that's
only
in
the
very
unusual
case
mr.
justice
clark.
we
have
an
unusual
case
here.
we're
--
we
have
a
lawyer
who
is
the
member
of
the
massachusetts
bar
as
professional
standing
as
at
stake.
his
family
feels
very
strongly
about
his
standing
and
the
reflection
on
them
as
the
record
will
show
one
of
his
brothers
who
was
in
touch
with
judge
ford,
there
is
physician
and
(inaudible)
thought
of
people
and
they
would
like
to
indicate
his
reputation,
they
feel
that
he
really
was
improperly
convicted.
but
in
most
of
these
cases,
i
think
or
in
many
cases
it's
economical
to
take
a
short
sentence
and
let
it
go
at
that.
now
mr.
justice
white
you
asked
me
a
question
and
i
mean
to
answer
directly,
if
you
were
to
appeal
directly
and
i
can
only
try
to
put
myself
in
a
position
of
counsel
back
at
that
time.
if
you
were
to
say
we'll
give
notice
of
appeal
right
here.
it's
our
position
that
the
notice
of
appeal
transfers
the
entire
case
of
court
of
appeals
under
the
rule.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
oh
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well
that
is
the
rule
of
criminal
procedure.
that's
the
wrong
talk
about
it.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
oh
you
may
it
could
be
changed.
is
that
what
your
honor
has
in
mind?
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
believe
that
maybe
true,
but
i
think
your
honor
that
that's
opened
a
very
serious
question
and
questionable
propriety,
and
if
you
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well
i
believe
that's
not
possible
if
your
honor
please
because
under
the
rules
the
entire
case
is
transferred
to
the
court
of
appeal
and
we've
referring
to
a
smith
case
in
our
brief
here.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
oh
certainly,
certainly.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
within
constitution
limits.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well
no
i
would
say
an
answer
to
that
mr.
justice
white
that
if
congress
intended
to
change
the
rules
regarding
the
time
for
appeal
and
time
for
giving
notice
of
appeal
they
would
have
done
so
and
so
many
words
and
not
left
it
to
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
might
well
have
had
that
your
honor
and
in
the
berman
case
which
we
decided.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
that's
correct.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
beg
your
honor
pardon.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
no,
no
your
honor
there
was
not.
in
that
connection
i
think
the
court
you
know
that
the
district
court
simply
said
i
order
him
committed
to
the
custody
of
attorney
general,
that's
all
under
4208
(b).
mr.
russell
morton
brown
the
statute
says
this
shall
be
within
the
commitment
for
the
maximum
term.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes
sir.
in
other
words
like
court
couldn't
later
come
back
and
impose
a
more
severe
sentence,
so
they
leave
open
the
entire
range
of
punitive
authority.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well
i
think
that's
a
very
important
consideration
your
honor.
it
sort
highlights
the
matter
that
man
who
is
admitted
to
probation
frequently
accepts
the
probation
regardless
of
his
feelings
about
guilt
or
innocence
and
he
tries
to
adapt
himself
to
the
new
circumstance
whereas
if
he
was
sentenced
say
the
10
years
or
let
alone
some
extravagant
period,
he
may
appeal.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yeah.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well,
i
simply
would
say
this
and
let
me
offer
this
thought
to
mr.
justice
white.
in
the
event
that
a
defendant
did
not
want
to
go
along
with
this
procedure
and
i
think
this
defendant
did,
if
a
defendant
didn't
want
to
do
so,
he
would
simply
through
this
counsel
say
to
the
court
if
you
want
to
please
we
would
like
to
take
an
immediate
appeal
and
we'll
ask
you
wanted
to
impose
a
definite
sentence,
i'm
sure
the
court
would
so,
and
i'm
sure
that
this
court
and
this
is
an
important
factor
i
would
like
to
ask.
this
court
in
the
exercise
of
the
supervisory
authority
and
in
the
decision
of
this
case
should
might
get
clear
that
district
courts
and
administering
this
statute
should
impose
a
final
and
appealable
sentence
if
they
should
deicide
that
this
one
is
not
appealable
which
i
believe
it
is
not.
in
other
words,
they
can
always
come
back
and
resort
to
the
4208
procedure
as
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
white
suggests
in
the
even
the
conviction
is
affirmed
then
the
judge's
decision
has
to
be
made
as
to
what
sentences
is
imposed.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well,
that's
exactly
right,
but
in
this
case
we're
dealing
with
the
jurisdictional
problem
it
is
no
matter
as
mr.
justice
brennan
suggests
that
vermont
case
might
be
met
with
the
argument
that
you
will
appeal
to
some.
and
i
think
that
would
be
true
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
that
in
the
vermont
case
chief
justice
hughes,
laid
down
a
rule
that
we've
always
followed
in
civil
and
in
criminal
litigation
that
finality
occurs
only
when
the
sentence
or
the
judgment
leaves
nothing
to
be
done
by
the
court
except
to
carry
the
execution,
what
has
been
decided,
that
had
been
achieved,
that
status
had
not
been
achieved
in
this
case
until
our
reports
came
back
from
the
bureau
of
prisons
and
a
court
performed
a
statutory
obligation
to
consider
those
reports
and
to
apply
them
to
the
situation
existing.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
no
i'm
not
suggesting
that
your
honor.
i'm
simply
saying
that
we
have
rule
46
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
which
entitle
them
to
at
liberty
under
bond
until
the
conviction
in
the
trial
court
is
settled.
then
you
have
46
(a)
(2),
rule
46
(a)
(2)
which
then
says
that
he's
been
entitled
be
in
liberty
your
honor,
when
during
the
appeal
and
(inaudible)
so
he's
entitled
to
be
a
liberty
under
bond
let's
say
until
the
final
decision
of
the
case
in
this
court
and
it
comes
back
to
the
district
court
and
under
rule
35
that
district
court
may
at
that
time
not
apply
the
sentence
and
of
course
at
that
time,
i
suppose
the
district
court
could
resort
to
4208.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
some
members
of
court
have
a
question
for
me
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
if
your
honor
please,
the
record
of
the
legislative
history
to
which
we
have
referred
in
the
brief
does
actually
show
that
the
judicial
conference
considered
attentive
disposition
and
that
final
judgment
was
to
be
rendered
after
the
reports
came
back.
we've
spelled
that
out
and
your
honor's
recollection
is
--.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well
i
think
if
the
bill
has
passed
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes
apparently
your
honor
fine,
i
don't
mean
to
intrude.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
probably
there
was
recognition
that
something
wasn't
clear
in
the
bill.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
thank
you
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
thank
the
solicitor
general
for
providing
us
with
various
information
as
this
matter
moved
on
to
hearing
date.
in
response
particularly
to
mr.
justice
goldberg's
enquiry
as
to
an
election,
i
think
that
the
type
of
construction
we're
asking
here
is
in
fact
an
election
procedure.
for
example
if
the
judge
invokes
4208
(b)
and
says
i've
proposed
a
sentence
here,
this
defendant
under
4208
(b)
that
a
defendant
has
an
election,
he
may
voluntarily
go
ahead
as
our
petition
did
here
and
receive
the
benefit
of
psychiatric
studies
and
that
sort
of
thing
or
he
may
say
to
the
courts
through
his
counsel
of
course
your
honor
please
we
feel
that
the
trial
was
not
properly
conducted
and
we'd
like
to
appeal
and
we
ask
your
honor
to
impose
a
final
definite
number
of
years
sentence
even
if
you
impose
the
maximum
375
years
then
we
can
appeal.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well,
it
is.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
my
thought
mr.
justice
brennan
is
that
if
he
does
go
along
with
the
4208
(b)
proceeding,
he
excessively
incarceration
in
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
think
he
says
i
want
to
--
yes
that
he
says
i
want
to
appeal,
the
court,
as
particularly
if
this
court
would
indicate
that
was
a
proper
procedure
in
the
course
of
this
court's
supervising
authority,
would
say,
the
court
would
then
be
properly
moved
to
sentenced
to
a
definite
term
of
years,
no
matter
how
great,
he
can
appeal.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well
i
certainly
wouldn't
have
any
right
to
insist,
i
would
say
that,
but
this
court
in
the
course
of
its
supervisory
authority
over
the
conduct
in
lower
courts
in
the
country,
if
this
court
would
say
that
it
would
be
proper
for
the
court
in
that
kind
of
case,
to
impose
a
definite
term
of
years,
that
said
(inaudible).
now
in
this
very
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well
no,
i
beg
your
honor's
pardon.
in
this
case
for
example
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
court
said,
i
commit
you
to
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general
under
4208
(b).
now
by
construction
of
law
it's
deemed
to
be
the
maximum.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
now
in
the
behrens
case
the
very
case
which
is
here
in
number
86
into
which
the
solicitor
general
has
referred,
there
was
in
that
case
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well
yes
the
court
said,
i
sentence
you
to
20
years
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
--
which
was
the
maximum.
now
later
he
sought
to
appeal
and
it's
not
before
the
court
here,
but
it's
related
to
(inaudible),
he
sought
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis.
the
court
said
that
there
was
nothing
before
the
court
after
it
had
imposed
that
20
year
sentence
and
at
that
time
for
giving
that
10-day
notice
had
elapsed
and
he
couldn't
appeal.
and
so
he
lost
his
right
of
appeal
in
that
regard
and
so
far
as
i
am
aware
he
has
not
carried
it
forward
as
we
have
to
raise
the
propriety
of
the
ruling.
but
i
would
say
that
in
that
case
it's
on
different
basis
mr.
justice
harlan,
because
the
court
did
impose
that
definite
term
of
20
years.
it
left
nothing
further
to
be
done
except
that
he
said
i
would
like
to
have
a
report
under
4208
(c).
now
it
wasn't
b
--
it
was
4208
(c)
which
authorizes
the
court
to
get
this
psychiatric
study
and
advisory
report
from
the
bureau
of
prisons
and
then
utilize
it
in
acting
say
under
35
or
what,
one
very
important
effect
of
this
4208
(b)
is
that
it
extends
from
90
days
from
60
to
90
days,
the
period
of
the
court's
control
over
the
sentence
and
then
for
an
additional
three
months
if
the
court
sees
fit.
and
this
is
designed
to
be
a
judicial
tool
to
be
used
in
favor
of
the
defendant
and
for
that
reason
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
him
to
make
the
election,
will
he
accept
the
benefits
here,
or
does
he
want
to
appeal.
now
many
times
a
party
will
say
i
am
innocent,
but
i
can't
take
the
time
and
i
can't
take
the
expense
or
i
haven't
got
the
facilities
for
appeal
or
maybe
he
doesn't
even
have
the
evidence
to
vindicate
himself
as
a
jury
verdict
that
has
established
his
guilt
and
he
has
to
learn
to
live
with
it.
however,
i
think
the
election
procedure
is
available
if
this
court
prescribes
it.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
very
much
so
your
honor,
very
much
so
i
have
seen
it
many
times.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes
i
agree
but
then
when
we
have
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well
no,
we
come
back
and
he
may
use
the
4208
(b)
procedure
at
that
time.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well
i
would
like
to
appeal
that
the
courts
try
to
administer
the
rules,
you
know,
on
the
basis
of
the
law
rather
than
on
personalities
or
get
mad
if
you
could
mr.
chief
justice
warren
has
just
suggested
that
some
judges
want
a
person
to
(inaudible).
now
in
this
case,
i
think
the
court
will
be
interested
that
judge
boyd
and
i
notice
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
he
said,
i
wanted
to
know
that
i
consider
a
perjured
defense
was
offered
in
support
of
this
defendant
here.
now
i
really
think
that
if
i
had
been
counsel
at
that
point
and
if
we
were
permitted
to
appeal,
i
would
have
raised
that
as
prejudicial
in
the
formulation
essence,
he
is
entailed
to
be
sentenced
for
the
offense
he
committed,
not
for
the
unspecified
perjury
that
the
judge
personally
made
up
his
mind
to
charging
with
and
find
him
guilty
because
i
don't
really
believe
mr.
justice
white
that
there
was
a
perjured
defense
in
this
case.
now
i
don't
know
a
great
deal
about
i
wasn't
present
at
the
trial,
but
i
have
talked
with
the
defendant
i've
reviewed
the
record.
i
really
doubt
that
there
was
a
perjured
defense.
i
think
we
have
a,
there
maybe
a
very
confused
defendant,
he's
got
a
30%
psychiatric
disability
in
the
veterans
administration
as
a
result
of
war
time
service.
now
i
don't
know
really,
you
know,
i
have
to
be
perfectly
frank,
but
i
don't
think
he
committed
perjury
and
the
judge
says
i
am,
wanting
to
know
that
imposing
this
sentence,
i
am
taking
into
consideration
that
a
perjured
defense
resort.
that's
citied
in
a
foot
note,
to
the
solicitor
general's
brief.
if
i
would
have
made
that
the
subject
of
appeal
myself.
i
would
have
said
that
that
was
an
improper
sentence.
he
is
not
at
liberty
to
take
that
into
consideration.
now
i
must
move
along
but
in
formulating
an
appeal
severity
of
sentence
is
always
the
gauge.
if
that's
going
to
be
suspension
of
sentence
or
maybe
some
very
light
nominal
sentence
maybe
its
best
to
forgo
the
appeal.
as
i
say,
not
everybody
can
afford
these
appeals
and
all
that
sort
of
thing.
now
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well
it's
my
opinion
mr.
justice
clark
that
under
rule
46
he
is
entailed
to
bail
as
long
as
its
in
the
district
court,
and
until
the
district
court
disposes
under
46
(a)
(1),
he
is
entailed
to
bail
and
he
is
entailed
a
bail
under
46
(a)
(2)
except
in
capital
cases
and
this
is
certainly
not
that
kind
of
case.
now
if
he
is
entitled
to
bail
this
puts
of
to
study.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well
they
believe
and
i
am
inclined
to
agree
that
if
he
is
not
being
in
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general,
he
must
be
in
custody
at
some
regularly
established
place,
with
such
custody
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes,
your
honor
they
are.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
no,
exactly
if
we
have
a
very
wonderful
superintendent
of
federal
prisons,
james
v.
benet
and
he
is
going
to
perfectly
marvelous
job
and
he
has
record
of
system
that
has
really
brought
into
a
play,
the
very
finest
kind
of
enlightened
study
facilities.
this
man,
the
petitioner
here
was
very
much
benefited
by
his
90
days
in
lewisburg
federal
penitentiary
and
i
think
if
he
were
asked
whether
he
was
where
he
went
i
think
he
would
say
he
was.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
believe
so
your
honor,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
at
least
let's
differ.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
conclusion
of
the
litigation.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
he
has
too.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
he
can't
go
on
bail
unless
he's
going
to
appeal.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
well,
i
think
i
receive
your
point
your
honor
and
i
apologize,
(inaudible)
under
4208
(b),
at
that
time
he
decides
either
that
he
wants
to
appeal
or
he's
going
to
find
out
what
the
results
of
the
4208
(b)
proceedings
will
be.
so
he
says,
i'll
accept
my
sentence
and
i'll
go
to
the
prison
and
subject
myself
to
the
psychiatric
study.
at
that
time
he
comes
back
into
court
and
the
sentence
is
pronounced.
under
my
analysis
he
then
will
make
up
his
mind
whether
he
wants
to
appeal
or
not.
on
the
other
hand
if
he
did
not
want
to
go
at
all
to
the
penitentiary
until
he
had
litigated
this
course,
he
would
say
to
the
court
if
your
honor
please
i
would
like
to
appeal,
i
would
like
your
honor
to
impose
a
sentence
of
definite
number
of
years
and
he
makes
the
bail,
he
goes
on.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
view
it,
but
it
is
not
a
conclusion
of
this
litigation.
in
the
furman
case,
chief
justice
hughes
laid
down
a
rule
which
mr.
justice
black
speaking
for
the
court
(inaudible)
case
follows,
that
finality
is
that
state
of
affairs
that
occurs
when
there
is
nothing
left
to
be
done
but
enforcement.
now,
i
think
it
certainly
was
the
probation,
but
this
was
a
complete
disposition
of
a
case,
there
was
nothing
left
to
be
done.
in
the
case
at
bar
that
court
must
receive
the
reports
from
the
bureau
of
prisons,
consider
them
and
then
take
the
action
contemplated
by
the
statute.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
if
he
has
no
right
to
appeal
--
mr.
russell
morton
brown
from
the
first
if
it's
not
final
and
he
can't
get
bail,
presumably
he
would
have
been
in
bail
all
through
the
proceeding
your
honor
unless
the
court
had
increased
the
bail
he
could
meet
the
increased
bail
after
the
conviction,
but
he
would
have
to
be
in
custody
during
that
period,
but
not
in
the
federal
penitentiary
presumably
in
the
local.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
90
days
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
90
days.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
yes
your
honor.
mr.
russell
morton
brown
i
would
say
the
court
is
under
no
obligation
to
do
so
unless
this
court
should
announce
in
the
exercise
of
supervisory
authority
that
that
would
be
a
proper
administration
of
the
statute.
we
welcome
the
clarification
offered
by
these
new
bills
and
hope
they
will
be
enacted.
our
chief
criticism
is
your
honor,
that
in
this
case
at
least
this
petitioner's
right
to
appeal
was
lost
for
not
understanding
that
the
right
to
appeal
was
affected
by
these
by
4208
(b)
without
any
mention
of
the
right
of
appeal.
if
it
had
been
said
as
was
in
the
legislative
history
referred
to
in
number
86
the
very
much
earlier
legislative
history,
they
proposed
to
say
that
the
final
judgment
would
be
such
and
such
and
the
court
may
act
even
though
appeal
is
pending.
in
the
smith
case
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
this
court
rules
that
the
district
court
had
no
authority
to
grant
a
new
trial
while
an
appeal
was
pending
and
they
issued
orders
mandamus
and
probation
to
grant
an
interference
with
the
appellate
procedure.
in
other
words
the
district
court
was
forbidden
to
act
while
an
appeal
was
pending
and
i
think
that's
a
proper
administration
of
the
law.
when
an
appeal
was
taken
it
moves
into
the
court
of
appeals,
district
court
loses
its
authority
on
that.
it
couldn't
possibly
minimize
the
sentence
lawfully
while
the
case
is
on
appeal
and
probably
wouldn't
itself.
and
if
they
did
so
a
fellow
might
say
well
i've
been
in
the
penitentiary
six
months
and
the
court
has
reduced
my
sentence
to
the
time
served
i'll
abandon
my
appeal.
now
why
should
we
congest
the
appellate
courts
with
appeals
that
we
know
may
never
be
taken
and
why
should
we
even
following
that
congest
this
court
with
needless
petitions
for
certiorari
that
may
never
be
brought.
in
other
words,
let's
wind
up
the
litigation
in
the
district
court.
mr.
justice
goldberg
says
we
have
an
election
that
this
court
can
sort
of
prescribe
by
saying
that
it
would
be
proper
for
the
district
judge
to
impose
a
definite
appealable
sentence
on
request.
now
actually
all
we
say
is
this.
counsel
and
defendants
has
no
rights
to
complaint
about
administration
of
law
except
that
the
law
should
be
clear
enough
so
that
a
lawyer
below
would
know
when
his
ten
days
begins
to
run
or
when
he
should
take
his
appeal.
is
there
any
further
questions?
mr.
russell
morton
brown
thank
you
your
honor.
