what
would
have
to
you
--
to
loose,
you
would
still
have
the
benefit
of
the
procedure,
what
would
you
have
to
loose
if
you
appeal
immediately.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
evidences
certainly
do
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
asking,
what
you
have
got
to
loose
by
appealing
immediately?
the
judge
ordered
this
procedure
and
assume
you
have
choice
between
appealing
immediately
or
appealing
after
the
final
imposition
of
settling
after
the
examination
is
over
the
judge
take
some
absolutely
final
action.
what
if
you
have
the
choice?
why
wouldn't
you
in
the
normal
situation
accused
to
appeal
immediately?
justice
byron
r.
white
through
no
matter
whether
the
--
that
just
a
matter
of
whether
you're
going
appeal
it
or
not,
not
when
--
justice
byron
r.
white
which
would
have
to
be
the
rule
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
wouldn't
have
to
be
the
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
doesn't
happen
to
be
implied.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
it
gives
to
you.
you
would
also
decide
that
congress
intended
that
the
4208
procedure
go
along
at
the
same
time
as
you
did,
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i've
said
congress
been
change
the
rule
again.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
didn't
suggest
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
suggested
that
did
by
under
4208.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
with
words
like
finality
you
had
the
choice
of
the
appeal,
won't
appeal,
you
(inaudible)
or
later.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
that
to
make
this
more
valid
or
constitutionally
that
the
defendant
must
consent
to
the
4208
procedure.
justice
byron

do
you

(inaudible)
justice

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
i
don't
want
4208
(b)
i
want
to
appeal
and
please
impose
a
definite
term
of
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
judge
has
probably
imposed
--
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
are
supposed
to
refer.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
arguably
further
down
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
be,
if
there
is
4208
(a),
4208
(a)
order
entered
the
defendant
then
nevertheless
could
go
on
bail
if
he
wanted
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
event
the
4208
(a),
certainly
the
4208
proceeding
then
vitiated
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
differ
until
when?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
you
had,
what
you're
really
saying
is
that
if
he
goes
on
bail
he
should
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
4208
order
is
entered.
the
prisoner,
the
defendant
then
is
either
going
to
go
be
studied
in
one
of
mr.
benet's
institutions
or
he's
going
to
go
on
bail.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
suggesting
is
that
he
can't
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
unless
--
as
long
as
the
4208
orders
outstanding
though
he
has
in
your
view
no
right
to
bail,
until
the
study
is
--
