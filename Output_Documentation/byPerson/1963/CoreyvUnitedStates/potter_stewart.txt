justice

stewart
you
know,
even
90
days.
justice
potter
stewart
but
under
the
statute
of
this
meant,
under
of
the
statute
of
this
meant
the
maximum
sentence
to
this
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
was
drag
to
that
way
so
as
to
avoid
support
constitutional
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
claiborne
wouldn't
the
basic
purpose
of
this
provision
be
frustrated
if
the
defendant
were
released
on
bail
pending
appeal,
if
the
appeal
were
taken
from
the
original
conviction?
in
other
words,
doesn't
if
the
--
isn't
it
contemplated
by
this
provision
that
the
defendant
be
incarcerated
or
at
least
in
the
custody
of
somebody
so
that
he
can
be
observed
and
interviewed
and
studied
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
is
a
very
unusual
case
and
that
this
defendant
was
the
member
of
bar
of
massachusetts
and
obviously
a
criminal
conviction
or
i
assume
a
criminal
conviction
would
result
in
dismemberment
and
arrest,
this
fellow
is
not
a
typical
federal
criminal
defendant.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
don't
understand
the
first
man
because
it's
not
function
of
a
court
of
appeal
to
decide
whether
a
person
is
completely
innocent
or
guilty.
it's
only
--
it's
function
to
decide
whether
or
not
there
was
trial
and
error.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
say
anything
whether
he
is
innocent
or
guilty,
he
talks
about
the
errors
committed
at
the
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
this
would
concededly
add
to
the
burden
of
the
courts
of
appeals
and
add
to
the
expense
of
those
defendants
who
felt
compelled
to
appeal,
because
they
didn't
know
what
their
sentence
is
going
to
be
and
add
to
the
expense
and
burden
of
the
government,
the
rule
that
you
propose
would
it
not,
because
it
would
undoubtedly
produce
an
increased
number
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
for
any
change
would
have
to
be
a
reduction
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
how
much
is
the
section
4208
(a)
used?
justice
potter
stewart
high
it
was
enacted
at
the
same
time.
justice
potter
stewart
without
limitation.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
what,
that's
what
4208
(b)
itself
provides
within
a
definite
terms
of
years
be
imposed,
the
maximum.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
trial
court
made
an
explicit
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
