mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
if
it
please
the
court.
on
june
29,
1959
the
respondent
who
was
the
virginia
state
bar
instituted
an
equity
proceeding
in
the
chancery
court
of
the
city
of
richmond
against
the
petitioner.
it
alleged
among
other
things
that
the
brotherhood
the
petitioner
maintained
a
legal
aid
department
and
while
collecting
certain
information
for
itself
it
solicited
business
for
legal
counsel
and
it
detailed
how
it
did
it.
it
said
that
large
members
were
injured
the
local
secretary
of
the
lodge
reported
to
the
legal
aid
department
which
we
now
call
legal
--
department
of
legal
counsel
and
in
turn
an
investigator
would
go
out
and
secure
certain
information
and
also
recommend
legal
counsel.
it
also
alleged
that
the
claims
handled
by
the
legal
counsel
were
handled
on
a
contingent
fixed-fee
basis
by
the
brotherhood
and
followed
that
legal
counsel
supported
and
maintained
the
department
of
legal
aid,
which
is
department
of
legal
counsel
now.
the
brotherhood
accrued
the
bill
of
complaint
and
said
that
prior
to
08/01/59
which
was
the
decision
of
the
illinois
case
it
did
set
the
fee
of
legal
counsel.
legal
counsel
did
support
the
department
of
legal
counsel
which
was,
at
one
time,
legal
aid.
they
said
however,
in
their
answer
and
evidence
showed
that
three
months
before
this
suit
was
instituted,
and
this
is
the
words
we
used,
“the
brotherhood
no
longer
sets
the
fee
to
be
charged
by
legal
counsel.
the
brotherhood
did
not
share
in
the
direct
or
indirect
of
the
fee.
the
brotherhood's
counsel
no
longer
contributes
to
the
support
the
legal
aid
department.
now,
the
brotherhood
in
its
answer
and
also
by
written
motion
raised
the
constitutional
question.
they
said
they
had
a
legal
right
to
inform
its
member
generally
and
specifically
that
they
should
employ
a
legal
counsel
where
they
were
injured
and
they
suggested
a
counsel
who
is
capable
of
handling
it,
who
is
a
legal
aid.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
yes?
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
27.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
we
think
that
about
four
are
sole
partners
that
it
pardons
all
the
others
but
we
could
live
under
and
starting
with
c
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
from
holding
out
lawyers
selected
by
it
as
the
only
approved
lawyer
to
aid
the
members
or
their
family.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
d
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
we
cannot
live
with
that,
no,
sir.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
that
--
that
pardons
all
the
other.
d,
from
in
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
d.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
from
informing
any
lawyer
that
an
action
has
occurred
and
furnish
the
name
and
address
on
an
injured
or
deceased
member
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
legal
employment
for
such
lawyer
or
in
any
other
manner,
soliciting
or
encouraging
such
employment
of
selected
lawyer.
and
last,
which
would
be
the
cleanup
clause
under
h
and
from
doing
any
act
or
commendation
of
facts
and
from
formulating
and
putting
into
practice
any
plan
pattern
or
design.
the
result
of
which
is
to
channel
legal
employment
to
any
particular
lawyer
or
groups
of
lawyers.
we
say
those
four
things
would
literally
destroy
any
communication
between
our
members
and
the
brotherhood.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
(voice
overlap)
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
fact.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
we
say
that
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
the
brotherhood
cannot
select
a
qualified
lawyer
to
handle
fela
cases
and
cannot
suggest
those
lawyers
to
its
members.
in
other
words,
no
mode
of
expression
at
all,
no
communication
between
the
brotherhood
and
its
members
and
the
members
are
the
brotherhood.
in
other
words,
it
--
there
is
no
permissible
area
at
all.
it
completely
destroys
communication.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
the
c.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
yes
sir
and
the
last
one,
which
would
be
h
does
that
too.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
h
goes
much
further.
it
says
they
can't
channel
any
business
to
any
lawyer
not
necessarily
legal
counsel
but
any
lawyer
that
cannot
channel
the
business
to.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
from
holding
out
lawyers
selected
as
the
only
approved
lawyers
to
aid
no
sir,
we
would
not
because
h
goes
ahead
and
says,
"you
cannot
suggest
any
lawyer
or
any
groups
of
lawyers
because
that
would
be
channeling
legal
business."
now,
this
case
has
a
little
history
to
it.
the
first
case
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
yes?
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
the
brotherhood
does
not
want
to,
but
if
it
wanted
to
it
would
be
prohibited
because
that
would
be
channeling
legal
business
to
any
lawyer
or
any
selected
lawyer.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
that
perhaps
would
be
prohibited
under
canon
35.
and,
mr.
drinker
--
henry
s.
drinker
said
that
ought
to
be
changed
permit
it
and
also
another
gentleman
had
said
that.
now,
coming
back
to
the
history
of
this
case,
the
first
case,
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
the
reasons
for
the
extension
and
i
think
the
reasons
are
very
sound.
the
brotherhood
found
that
a
large
number
of
its
members
were
injured
and
killed
each
year
because
they
worked
in
hazardous
business.
they
found
that
railroads
had
some
unscrupulous
claim
agents.
they
further
found
that
their
average
lawyer
knew
nothing
to
whirl
about
fela
cases.
i'll
give
an
example
in
a
few
minutes.
it
also
found
that
the
rules
of
certain
railroads
prohibited
members
from
talking
to
any
outsider
or
employing
a
lawyer.
they
fired
them
if
they
employed
a
lawyer
or
if
they
talked
to
anybody
on
the
outside.
fortunately,
the
railroad
brotherhood
the
plaintiff
or
petitioner
here
got
the
fela
section
60
amended
so
that
it
made
it
unlawful
for
railroad
to
fire
a
man
talking
to
the
outsiders.
now,
mr.
lush
who
is
general
manager
here
for
a
number
of
years
in
this
legal
aid
department,
he
gives
two
examples
and
i'd
like
to
give
his
example.
he
gives
more
but
i'll
give
two.
he
said
that
the
safety
appliance
act
required
railroads
to
have
a
coupler
which
would
couple
or
uncouple
automatically
and
he
said,
“sometimes,
the
member,”
and
he
gave
a
specific
example
on
page
915
to
937.
he
said,
"this
man
went
into
jiggle
down
the
block
and
lost
his
arm."
the
claim
agent
of
the
railroad
came
around
and
asked
him,
"was
the
coupler
broken?"
he
said
“no."
then
when
he
wrote
up
his
statement
he
said,
"the
coupler
was
not
defective."
he
said,
“our
member,
as
an
average
railroad
man,
cannot
differentiate
between
broken
and
a
defective
coupler.”
he
gave
two
other
very
astounding
examples.
he
said,
"an
inexperienced
lawyer
in
fela
cases
did
this
to
their
members.
the
member
lost
20
years
seniority
because
the
lawyer
was
inexperienced.
another
one
lost
25
years
of
seniority.”
and
he
goes
on
and
gives
other
examples.
now,
the
first
case
that
ever
came
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
sir?
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
no,
sir.
that
would
be
handled
under
selective
bargaining
agreement,
but
it
show
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
sir?
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
yes,
sir.
but
in
negotiating
the
settlement,
the
man
lost
his
seniority.
he
might
have
gotten
a
few
dollars.
if
an
experienced
lawyer
would
not
have
lost
his
seniority
it
would've
been
a
great
deal
more
than
maybe
the
settlement
$2,000-$3,000.
the
first
important
case
to
come
to
an
appellate
court
was
ryan
versus
the
pennsylvania
railroad.
mr.
ryan,
a
distinguished
chicago
lawyer,
was
referred
a
case
by
the
brotherhood.
he
sent
a
notice
of
lien
in
and
the
pennsylvania
railroad
settled
behind
his
back.
mr.
ryan
brought
a
lawsuit
on
that
lien.
the
pennsylvania
railroad
defended
on
the
ground
that
he
had
secured
the
case
for
solicitation
and
it
was
against
public
policy
to
sue
on
a
contract
that
was
--
violated
public
policy.
the
court
said
and
made
a
clear
distinction
in
that
case
between
the
referral
by
--
made
by
the
brotherhood
and
regional
and
unlawful
solicitation
that
court
further
said
that
the
plan
was
alright
and
they
put
great
emphasis
on
the
plan
because
it
served
a
worthy
purpose
and
the
lawyer
who
said
that
mr.
ryan
was
the
beneficiary
of
unethical
conduct,
they
said
he
should
not
have
made
that
statement.
it's
an
unworthy
distinction
the
lawyer
made.
the
next
case
that
came
before
the
court
in
1933,
it
was
the
cleveland
bar
in
ohio.
they
brought
a
disciplinary
action
against
one
of
the
legal
counsel,
judge
newcomer.
the
court
refused
to
enjoin
judge
newcomer
but
did
reprimand
him.
it
is
a
two-to-one
decision.
the
decision
had
a
dissent
and
that
was
justice
levi.
justice
levi
had
said
it
is
not
claimed
that
the
--
by
the
cleveland
bar
that
this
was
an
ordinary
harmless
case
and
it
was
a
different
case
and
he
said,
“even
the
members
of
rule
28
--
the
committees
if
there
is
a
conflict
of
opinion,
then
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
should
revise
rule
28."
the
next
case
was
a
california
case,
hildebrand.
that's
the
only
supreme
court
case
before
the
illinois
supreme
court
decision.
and,
actually,
we
are
arguing
here
for
illinois
made
our
plan.
we
are
here
saying
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
which
said
that
they
made
the
rules
whereby
lawyers
would
have
to
practice
after,
said
they
made
them
and
they
enforced
them.
and
they
said,
"we
think
this
plan
that
we
are
setting
down
here
does
not
conflict
with
any
other
practice
of
law
or
unauthorized
practice
of
law."
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
they
did
not
use
the
word,
but
they
gave
us
our
minimum
rights
and
we
feel
that
they
were
constitutional
rights
and
that's
why
they
stopped.
we
think
they
should
have
given
us
more,
but
they
gave
us
our
minimum.
we're
here
defending
that
and
that
court,
and
i'd
like
to
get
to
that
in
a
minute
because
there's
good
background
there
many
railroads,
the
bars
were
in
that.
it
is
well
heard.
one
of
the
justices
was
a
special
commissioner.
i
think
i'll
come
to
that
case
immediately
because
i
think
that
is
the
crux
of
our
argument.
the
brotherhood
went
in
before
the
supreme
court
on
a
regional
petition
and
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
they
wanted
to
know
their
rights
and
obligation.
their
counsel
wanted
to
know
their
rights
and
obligation.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
pointed
that
one
of
their
former
chief
justice
judge
thomas.
he
had
hints
and
the
people
who
participated
were
the
illinois
bar,
the
chicago
bar,
28
railroads
--
27
railroads.
the
american
bar
filed
a
friendly
brief.
while
the
court
did
not
approve
our
plan
as
then
being
operated,
they
gave
directions.
they
said,
"first,
you
can
have
your
investigators."
the
investigators
can
give
the
information
to
the
member
and
this
is
the
real
part.
he
said,
"you
can
give
general
information
to
your
membership
and
you
can
give
specific
information
on
these
questions
that
you
hire
a
lawyer.
the
appellant
can
tell
them
to
--
who
to
hire
because
you've
looked
in
and
known
something
about
their
capabilities."
now
the
court
said,
"we
couldn't
do
these
things
and
we
say
we
are
not
doing
it."
the
court
says
there's
no
financial
connection
whatsoever.
at
that
time
counsel
maintained
the
legal
aid
department.
at
that
time,
the
counsel
got
only
25%
i
don't
think
it's
shown
in
the
record
but
he
does
get
--
got
25%.
we
were
setting
that
fee.
we
told
--
we
thought
that
was
enough.
that
started
in
1920
--
1930.
they
said
"you
cannot
set
the
fee.
we
do
not
set
the
fee
today.
the
fee
is
set
by
the
law
and
its
client.
we
get
no
fee
from
him
whatsoever.”
in
1900,
the
record
show
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
i
said
the
brotherhood
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
the
evidence
shows
that
the
brotherhood,
in
1960
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
sir?
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
well,
i
want
to
show
what
has
happened
from
1960
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
because
in
1960,
they
paid
all
--
at
the
end
of
the
year
legal
counsel
would
send
in
maintaining
the
legal
aid
department.
they
stopped
at
april
1,
1959
but
they
received
for
those
three
months
in
1960
about
$23,000.
they
--
put
with
that
from
$55,000-$66,000
and
maintained
the
legal
aid
department.
in
1961,
the
department
of
legal
aid
was
supported
wholly
by
their
own
money
from
the
general
fund
it
was
$85,000.
now,
all
we
do
is
make
merely
referrals.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
we
say
that
you
ought
to
go
and
consult
legal
counsel.
you
can
say
back,
"no,
i'll
not
have
a
lawyer
at
all"
or
you
can
say
back
"i
would
take
him”
or
“i'll
get
my
own
lawyer."
the
evidence
shows
that
he
can
get
his
own
lawyer
anytime
he
wants
to.
it's
in
the
record.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
we
give
you
a
name
but
you
do
not
have
to
take
it.
some
of
them
--
record
shows
some
of
them
did
accept
and
some
did
not.
the
brotherhood
is
putting
out
about
$85,000
a
year
in
support
of
this
department.
he's
getting
no
money
back
in
whatsoever.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
the
lawyer
makes
his
own
contract.
he
sets
his
own
fee
and
he
keeps
it
all.
and
the
member
gets
the
service
of
the
brotherhood
free
because
all
of
them
pay
for
it.
well,
they
--
they
still
(inaudible).
now,
we
no
longer
have
investigators.
at
one
time,
we
had
as
many
as
50.
we
no
longer
have
investigators
paid,
but
we
do
have
designated
investigators.
the
president
says
that,
"if
he
wants
one
of
these
accidents
investigated,
he
give
a
call
to
the
local
chairman
or
some
officer
of
the
local
union
and
he
has
authority
in
his
bailiwick.
so
they
speak
to
investigate
and
make
the
report."
but
that
--
he
said,
"most
the
cases
were
investigated
but
there
were
many
never
investigated.”
now,
that's
all
we
do.
we
investigate,
turn
the
investigation
over
to
the
member,
suggest
a
lawyer
who's
capable
we
think,
and
that's
the
end
of
our
service.
of
course,
we
are
interested
and
we
follow
it.
we're
interested
to
see
how
it
comes
out,
but
we
know
where
in
direct
litigation
he
was
not
alleged.
we
do
not
in
anyway
conduct
a
litigation
at
all.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
none,
whatsoever.
there
are
two
witnesses
who
testified
in
this
case
and
the
wife
testified
and
said,
“they
told
us
we
could
take
legal
counsel
if
we
wanted
to
or
we
could
get
our
own
counsel.”
that's
in
the
record
by
evidence
adduced
by
the
respondent.
we
take
the
position
that
the
brotherhood
and
its
members
are
the
same.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
we
tell
him
exactly
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
we
--
we
tell
him
exactly
what
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
said
we
could
tell
him.
you
could
tell
him,
"tell
your
whole
membership
--
generally
we
think
you
ought
to
consult
lawyers
because
this
is
a
technical
matter."
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
and
it
takes
an
expert,
we
tell
him
generally
and
we
tell
him
specifically,
“we
think
you
should
employ
this
lawyer.”
but
they
can
tell
us,
it's
in
our
brief,
you
could
tell
us,
"we
don't
want
your
lawyer.
we'll
go
to
our
own
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
lawyer.”
“we
don't
need
a
lawyer,
we'll
settle
directly
to
the
railroad."
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
nothing
at
all
but
advice
him
of
legal
service.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
(voice
overlap)
we
do
advice
him
of
that
because
we
fee
that
the
supreme
court
said
we
could
do
it.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
the
secretary
--
under
the
constitution,
the
secretary
and
these
people
call
each
other
brother
and
they
know,
and
they
go
around.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
they're
making
a
report.
they
go
in
--
we'll
say
in
the
hospital
room,
and
they
talk
and
call
each
other
by
name
and
he
said,
"john,
i
think
you
ought
to
get
legal
counsel."
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
well,
they
do
say
“brother”
because
they
are
brothers
and
they
call
each
other
by
name,
first
name.
they
said,
"we
think
you
ought
to
get
legal
counsel."
the
brother
can
say,
"i'll
handle
my
own
case.”
we
don't
make
any
compulsion.
actually
it's
in
their
regulations
that
no
layman
can
advice
him
legally
at
all.
no
layman
can
advice
them
legally.
they
have
to
go
to
a
lawyer.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
well,
it's
usually
some
--
it
has
to
be
some
--
we
have
no
regional
investigators
now
that
run
around
all
over
the
country.
it
has
to
be
somebody
in
that
local
lodge
that
goes.
the
secretary
has
to
report
it.
he
reports
this
accident.
he
gives
the
name
fela1
i
believe.
he
gives
the
name.
then,
he
perhaps
calls
on
him
because
he
knows
him
and
he
says,
"i
think
you
should
employ
a
lawyer.
you
need
a
lawyer."
the
man
could
tell
him
“get
out
of
my
room.
he
needn't
come
around.
i'm
not
going
to
employ
a
lawyer.”
that's
perfectly
alright
with
us.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
there
is
a
list
of
our
regional
counsel
in
the
back
of
the
book,
a
directory.
there
are
16
of
them.
he
can
go
to
any
16
that
he
wants
to.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
this
is
countrywide.
in
virginia,
taking
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
16
lawyers
taking
virginia
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
that's
all,
with
exception
of
two
or
three
lawyers
in
the
state
working
perhaps
under
a
regional
counsel.
he
might
get
somebody
to
assist
him
on
something,
whether
the
association
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
16
regional
lawyers.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
no,
sir.
i
would
say
there
are
many
competent
lawyers
but
we
are
not
aware
of
those.
but
this
decree,
if
we
picked
half
of
the
bar
of
richmond,
we
said
to
our
membership,
“one-half
of
the
bar
of
richmond
are
capable."
this
enjoins
us
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
you
would
have
to
have
--
the
president
of
the
brotherhood
would
have
to
investigate
you
to
see
your
background
and
see
if
you're
really
will
represent
him,
that
you
were
a
capable
lawyer.
if
you've
got
on
the
list,
you
could
be
one
of
the
regional
counsels.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
then,
you
could
not
get
on
the
list.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
no
sir,
because
you
might
injure
some
of
our
seniority
rights
or
you
might
do
something
we
felt
that
you
weren't
capable
of.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
it
couldn't
afford
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
i
--
i
didn't
quite
understand
that,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
well,
of
course
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
i
must
admit
that
these
cases
involve
very
serious
accidents
and
they
are
remunerated
but
the
principle
here
is
this.
now,
the
basis
of
response
to
suit,
they
say,
is
the
judicial
prohibitions
of
the
common
law.
the
rules
promulgated
by
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
defined
in
the
practice
law
and
the
canons
of
ethics,
and
any
other
statutes,
they
say,
that
are
pertinent
thereto.
now,
if
the
basis
of
this
decree
is
common
law,
all
we
are
doing
that
involves
(inaudible)
which
the
central
of
it
is
established
malicious
intent.
all
we
are
doing
is
telling
the
brother,
“go
and
get
a
lawyer.”
there's
nothing
malicious
about
that
at
all.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
yes?
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
the
constitution,
section
20
--
91
provides,
in
every
accident,
the
secretary
of
the
lodge
is
supposed
to
make
a
written
report
of
that
accident.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
it's
his
duty
under
the
constitution.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
yes.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
the
legal
aid
department
tells
that,
“we
have
examined
their
qualification.
we
think
these
men
are
capable."
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
no
sir.
that
was
in
1930.
that's
the
dworkin
case
in
ohio.
the
head
of
the
legal
aid
department
was
a
lawyer
mr.
mcgregor,
and
he
was
doing
just
that.
he
was
telling
him
and
ohio
said
that
he
should
not
do
that.
they
changed
the
rules
and
regulations
providing
that
the
department
cannot
give
them
any
information.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
yes.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
yes.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
they
do
give
him
specifically
the
name
because
the
illinois
court
said
they
could
specifically
recommend
a
lawyer.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
yes.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
well,
i
do
not
know.
there
are
16
of
them.
it
perhaps
would
be
one
near
to
the
person
where
he
was
injured.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
it
wouldn't
be
one
in
california.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
it
would
be
--
ordinarily
one
of
those
16
who
they
had
looked
into
and
found
were
capable
of
handling
that
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
well,
ordinarily
it
would
be.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
but
--
well,
there's
a
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
there's
a
provision
in
the
rules
and
regulations
between
the
lawyer
and
the
brotherhood
which
was
in
existence
in
the
illinois
state.
it
said
that
we
cannot
control
our
members.
they
can
go
to
any
regional
counsel,
do
anything
they
want
to.
and
in
virginia
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
that's
printed
in
the
directory.
there's
a
general
printing
in
the
directory
and
he
calls
their
attention
to
those
capable
lawyers.
now,
take
virginia
in
1955
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
yes.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
there's
one
lawyer
in
baltimore
and
there's
one
lawyer
in
atlanta.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
and
there's
been
15
cases
handled
in
virginia
from
1955
through
1959,
four
years,
15
cases.
one
of
those
cases
went
to
atlanta.
they
went
out
from
down
in
danville,
virginia
got
on
the
train
and
went
down
to
atlanta
because
she
perhaps
felt
better
going
to
atlanta
than
instead
of
going
to
baltimore
to
see
a
regional
counsel,
or
she
could
employ
a
local
lawyer
if
she
wants
to.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
well,
i
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
--
don't
think
the
--
the
record
is
clear
on
just
that
he
said,“see
this
regional
lawyer”
because
the
rules
and
regulations
says
that
he
can't
tell
them
where
to
go.
he
can
just
say
“we
have
a
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
suggest,
that's
all.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
now
on
page
37
of
my
brief
i
point
out
that
the
bar
here
introduced
witnesses,
mr.
clifford
d.
olsen
and
apparently
everybody
knew
him.
even
the
lawyer
for
the
bar
called
him
cliff.
“would
you
relate
in
your
own
words
to
the
best
of
your
recollection
what
if
anything
mr.
klinkenberg
and
mr.
ballou
said
to
you
at
the
time
they
contacted
you
at
the
hospital?”
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
mr.
klinkenberg,
at
that
--
be
it,
at
that
time,
was
regional
investigator.
we
no
longer
have
regional
investigators.
“well
they
informed
me
that
they
were
representing
which
i
knew
ballou
was
of
the
railroad
brotherhood
trainmen
and
advised
me
of
my
rights
on
the
by-laws
of
the
brotherhood
trainmen.”
they
advised
him
under
the
by-laws
that
he
could
get
count.
now,
in
the
next
question
--
and
what
else
have
he
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
yes,
sir.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
they
can
write
their
own
contract
there,
your
honor.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
for
the
illinois
case
the
brotherhood
told
them
25%
they
felt
was
sufficient.
but
now,
the
evidence
shows
they
can
charge
anything
that
the
client
feels
they
should
want
to
pay.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
set
25?
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
yes.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
yes
sir,
we
are
in
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
no,
i
don't
think
that's
in
the
record.
i
don't
believe
that's
in
the
record
what
they're
charging.
i
do
not
know.
i
don't
think
it's
in
the
record.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
i
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
not
now.
the
person
in
the
railroad
--
i
mean,
the
brotherhood
testified
that
some
of
them
were
charged
in
the
third.
he
said
he
knew
some
of
them
were
charged
in
the
third
in
certain
sections
of
the
country.
now,
the
important
question
here
that
this
mr.
olsen
was
asked,
“and
what
else
if
anything
were
said
to
them?"
"well,
they
informed
me
that
i
could
use
legal
aid
if
i
so
wanted
to
do
so.”
then,
he's
asked
--
then
the
lawyer
asked
his
wife
on
that
very
point.
i
--
and
this
is
on
37
of
my
brief,
i'm
quoting
from
164
of
the
record,
"i'd
like
to
ask
one
more
question
mrs.
olsen,”
and
this
is
the
bar's
of
lawyer,
“you
testified
that
mr.
klinkenberg
advised
you
that
you
could
hire
some
other
lawyer
if
you
wanted
to
do
it?"
she
says,
“yes.”
and
he
said,
“you
can
hire
any
lawyer."
now,
the
president
of
the
railroad
brotherhood
said
likewise
on
the
same
page,
38.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
an
active
brother,
mr.
kennedy
--
mr.
park
kennedy.
page
38
and
we're
quoting
from
63
of
the
record.
he
was
asked,
“and
so
the
individual
knows
very
little
about
his
legal
rights
and
so
all
we
do
is
to
notify
them
as
to
their
legal
rights
and
suggest
that
they
confer
with
a
competent
qualified
attorney
for
further
handling."
"yes."
"now,
then
you
advised
him
that
he
can
have
the
services
of
your
selected
counsel
whom
you
deem
competent
if
he
wants
them."
"if
he
chooses
to
do
so,
yes
sir.
that
is
right."
"now,
in
the
serious
cases,
you
advised
him
to
get
your
counsel,
don't
you?"
"we
suggest
that
he
--
he
is
interested,
he
can
go
to
our
counsel.
he
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
use
our
counsel."
"but
you
advised
him
to
that."
"if
he
wants
to.
we
don't
force
him
to
do
it
if
that's
against
his
will.
he
can
go
to
any
counsel
he
choose
to
do
so."
and
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
that
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
i
could
not
name
them
all
but
i
could
give
you
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
the
president
of
the
--
he
picks
them
out.
the
president,
it's
on
the
constitution.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
national
union,
the
brotherhood
has
a
right
to
select
these
counsels.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
no,
i
wouldn't
think
so.
i
wouldn't
think
that
would
have
anything
--
because
it's
set
up
under
the
constitution.
i
wouldn't
think
there
would
ever
be
an
issue.
i
--
the
record
doesn't
show,
mr.
justice
back.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
would
show
that
at
all.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
are
they're
no
percentages
in
the
record?
the
evidence
started
and
stopped
in
1961
so
there
are
no
percentages
in
the
record.
so
we
do
not
know.
but
i
believe
it
would
take
judicial
knowledge.
in
fact,
there
can
be
more
than
15
people
injured
in
virginia
but
it's
about
five
million
people.
have
more
than
16
people
and
they
only
got
15
accidents
and
in
1955
two
people
are
hurt,
1958
--
i
mean
1956,
eight
people.
and,
the
two
people
are
hurt
in
1955
are
the
same
two
people
got
hurt
in
1956.
so
certainly,
the
lawyers
of
the
virginia
are
getting
majority
of
the
cases.
if
you
took
judicial
knowledge
of
a
state
of
five
million
people
that
they
had
more
than
15
accidents
in
four
years.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
i
would
not
know
but
hundreds
of
our
members
are
injured
and
killed.
the
record
show
hundreds
are
injured
and
killed
throughout
the
united
states.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
no,
there
are
no
percentages
at
all
in
the
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
i
would
not
know
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
not
know
at
all.
the
record
does
show
only
15
cases
handled
in
four
years
in
the
state
of
virginia
by
legal
counsel.
it's
on
page
901
of
the
record.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
i
do
not
know.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
well,
i'll
tell
you.
on
interrogatory
by
the
bar
they
asked
us,
"how
many
cases
give
the
railroads
of
an
engine
on
the
dates?"
and
we
listed
the
15
cases.
now,
they
may
have
been
consulted
on
all
cases
and
the
lawyer
says,
“i
don't
think
we
got
a
case.”
coming
specifically
to
this
--
the
provision
of
this
decree,
we
feel
that
this
decree
--
the
part
of
this
decree
that
we
referred
to
smothers
all
discussion
between
the
brotherhood
and
its
members.
we
feel
that
group
action
is
--
and
discussion
is
struck
down
by
this
decree.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
yes
sir.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
we
do
that.
they're
the
only
approved
lawyers.
we
list
16
in
the
book
and
they're
the
only
one
who
have
been
approved.
we
do
just
that.
but
we
don't
force
them
to
do
that.
we
suggest
it
and
if
they
don't
want
to
take
those
16
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
well,
i
would
give
you
an
example.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
i
would
give
this
example.
this
decree
would
prohibit
a
cousin.
i
recall
interviewing
a
man
who
said
that
his
cousin
was
killed
in
bluefield,
west
virginia.
he
was
in
virginia
and
he
said,
"i
told
her
a
widow”
because
i
felt
it
my
duty.
i
was
the
first
cousin,
“that
she
should
go
to
baltimore
and
employ
mr.
bernard
savage.”
under
this
decree,
he
could
not
tell
his
cousin's
wife
to
go
and
employ
a
lawyer.
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
any
lawyer
--
mr.
beecher
e.
stallard
well
--
