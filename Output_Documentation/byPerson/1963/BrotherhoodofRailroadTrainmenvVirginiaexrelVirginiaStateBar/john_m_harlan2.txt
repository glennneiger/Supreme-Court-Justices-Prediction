i
want
to
get
a
lawyer
of
my

or

does
the
brotherhood
take
any
initiative
in
me?
justice
john
m.
harlan

justice
john
m.
harlan
because
i'm
trying
to
get
the
scenery
of
this
picture.
do
you
--
i
suppose
most
of
these
lawyers
on
the
list
the
16
lawyers
take
these
cases
on
contingent
fees
don't
they?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
i
mean
what
is
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
your
original
program
as
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
to
set
at
25%
contingency.
justice
john
m.
harlan
which
is
--
now,
since
that
system
was
abandoned,
do
you
get
reports
from
these
lawyers
as
to
what
the
fees
they
received
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
particular
cases?

does
the

keep
records
itself
as
to
the
fees
that

m.
harlan
so,
how
many
of
these
cases
(inaudible)
--
how
many
of
these
cases
were
handled
by
lawyers
other
than
the
16
that
were
on

list?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
and
i'm
reading
from
page
4
of
the
petition
of
the
court.
the
court
finds
that
the
defendant
brotherhood,
still
adheres
to
the
pattern
and
design
of
the
plan
formulated
and
implemented
in
1930.
it's
the
old
plan,
which
i
understood
mr.
stallard
to
say
that
you've
given
up.
justice
john
m.
harlan
when
i
read
that
thing
to
mean
was
if
the
overall
effectiveness
is
to
go
down
as
to
define
the
recommendation
for
business
or
channel
this
kind
of
business,
if
they
had
another
lawyer?
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
record
support
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
in
the
records
where
there
are
(inaudible)
roughly,
what
the
amount
of
the
take
of
the
lawyers
is
on
the
500
cases,
roughly
would
you
say
would
be
with
the
brotherhood?

record
says
that
was

has
been
