mr.
john
j.
naughton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
stallard
has
discussed
the
general
outline
of
the
plan
and
the
way
in
which
it
has
been
operating
throughout
the
years.
it
seems
to
me
that
perhaps
mr.
stallard
misspoke
and
that
this
court
is
left
with
an
impression
that
the
local
lodge
officer
does
not
recommend
a
specific
lawyer.
i
think
in
fact
that
mr.
stallard
did
not
wish
to
tell
you
that.
he
wished
to
tell
you
what
is
in
the
record
which
is
the
exact
opposite
--
the
recommendations
in
all
cases
are
recommendations
of
specific
lawyers.
now
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
some
of
the
appointments
are
appointments
of
firms.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
and
so
in
that
case,
it
would
be
the
firm
name
that
would
be
giving
us
the
recommendations.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
that
is
correct
except
in
--
in
an
exceptional
circumstance
perhaps
where
a
secretary
of
a
local
lodge
was
familiar
with
two
lawyers
he
might.
so
you
could
go
to
either
one.
on
the
other
hand,
if
a
secretary
were
to
recommend
a
particular
lawyer
and
the
client
were
to
say,
“i
don't
like
that
lawyer”
then
the
secretary
might
recommend
another
lawyer
reasonably
close
to
the
residence
of
the
client.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
he
would
still
be
one
of
the
16.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
would
assume
that
it
would
be
the
next
closest.
the
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
the
specific
wording
of
the
decree
says
"acting
on
its
behalf."
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
would
say
that
it
might
apply
in
this
respect
in
that
we
are
asserting
constitutional
rights.
and
as
a
result
of
this
decree
being
entered
--
the
court
ordered
that
the
decree
be
served
on
all
the
secretaries
of
all
the
local
lodges
in
virginia.
now,
these
men
of
course
are
not
lawyers
and
how
they
would
interpret
that
decree
is
problematic.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
they
might
well
--
upon
being
served
by
a
sheriff
with
a
copy
of
this
decree
assume
that
they
could
not
recommend
any
lawyer
in
any
circumstance.
and
in
fact,
although
the
constitution
of
the
brotherhood
suggest
that
this
recommendation
and
referral
should
be
made
and
suggest
that
in
terms
of
duty.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
or
in
any
record
that
anything
has
been
done
as
a
disciplinary
matter
against
any
person
who
chooses
not
to
do
any
of
this.
and
in
fact,
as
in
most
plans
and
labor
organizations,
we
don't
approach
100%
unanimity
of
referral.
a
great
many
of
the
local
lodge
officers
refuse
to
fill
out
these
forms,
and
that's
shown
in
this
record
when
the
president
of
the
brotherhood
had
to
send
out
a
circular
saying,
“would
you
please
fill
out
these
forms.”
even
in
the
cases
where
you
don't
give
the
recommendation
we
use
this
information.
we
use
it
for
statistical
purpose.
we
go
to
congress,
and
this
record
shows
the
brotherhood
going
down
to
congress
as
a
result
of
what
they
learned
in
the
operation
of
this
plan.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
would
not
know
it
offhand,
your
honor.
i
would
assume
that
it
would
run
in
the
neighborhood
of
a
150-200
a
year.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
by
legal
counsel.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
in
the
country.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
but
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
no
not
by
members
of
our
brotherhood.
by
members
of
our
brotherhood,
my
guess
would
be
that
it
would
run
somewhat
around
500
that
is
that
we
would
get
roughly
a
third
of
the
cases
filed
throughout
the
country.
that
is
since
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
that
is
by
the
members.
i
thought
that
you
addressed
your
question
as
to
how
many
were
filed
by
our
legal
counsel.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
would
say
that
that
was
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
right.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes.
i
would
say
approximately
a
third.
i
would
also
say,
i
do
know
this
from
having
been
in
the
michigan
case
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
and
the
evidence
there
shown
that
the
percentage
of
the
cases
handled
by
brotherhood
counsel
has
declined
since
the
illinois
decision
changes
and
implementing
that
decision.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
would
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
would
--
i
would
suggest
that
--
well,
if
it's
in
the
thousands
my
figures
are
wrong
because
the
persons
who
most
suffer
the
injuries
and
deaths
are
the
switchmen
and
those
are
the
people
we
represent.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
would
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
there
should
be
at
least
a
thousand
i
would
assume
filed.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
and
there
are
probably
--
in
the
last
statistics,
i
remember
something
like
25,000
injuries
a
year
and
perhaps
a
100-150
deaths.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
would
suppose
they
were
settled
and
i
--
i
would
like
to
state
my
proposition
here
is
the
nature
of
the
interest
of
the
union
members
as
derived
from
public
policy
stated
in
federal
statutes.
that
we
assert
the
right
here
for
our
local
committee
men
to
settle
these
minor
personal
injury
cases
for
--
under
our
rules
--
time
lost
alone
without
any
other
elements
of
damage
as
a
part
of
our
representation
of
the
men
in
grievances
and
in
matters
arising
out
of
the
interpretation
or
application
of
collective
bargaining.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
only
wages
lost.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
we
have
instructed
our
members
not
to
assert
that
because
then
we
are
threading
on
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law
and
that
is
in
the
record.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
would
say
that
that
finding
as
made
by
the
court,
is
wholly
without
any
prerogative
evidence
on
which
to
base
it.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
your
honors
will
read
the
cases
dealing
with
this
matter,
you
will
see
that
there
have
been
many
adjustments
coming
to
the
point
where
there
is
now
a
25%
fee
charged
as
in
the
illinois
proceeding
which
was
at
that
time
set
by
the
president
of
the
brotherhood.
since
that
time
the
president
of
the
brotherhood
has
specifically
instructed
the
counsel.
they
are
relieved
from
that
setting
and
they
may
charge
what
they
feel
is
a
fair
charge
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
that
the
record
would
not
support
that
because,
as
mr.
stallard
stated,
there
are
no
figures
and
no
percentages
given
in
this
record.
what
was
done
in
this
record
was
the
association
of
american
railroads
picked
one
case
in
each
section
of
the
country
and
then
the
virginia
bar
took
the
deposition
of
that
man.
i
assume
that
the
association
picked
the
case
which
most
flagrantly
showed
the
abuses
which
they
claimed.
and
yet,
it
seems
that
on
this
record
there
are
no
abuses
shown
in
a
great
number
of
those
cases.
and,
as
a
matter
fact,
the
virginia
bar
in
its
brief
concedes
in
four
or
five
of
the
cases
that
there
are
no
abuses
shown.
the
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
in
the
1930
plan,
the
ch
--
the
fee
was
20%.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
and
5%
of
that
was
paid
to
the
brotherhood
to
finance
the
investigation
service
performed
by
the
brotherhood.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
oh
no,
there
is
absolutely
nothing.
as
a
matter
fact,
the
record
affirmatively
shows
the
opposite.
there
are
no
payments
made
to
the
brotherhood.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes,
there
is
some
point
made
of
president
w.p.
kennedy
stating
that,
in
circumstances
where
a
lawyer
would
charge
50%,
he
might
remove
him
but
i
don't
see
that
as
being
a
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
from
the
recommended
list.
i
don't
see
that
as
being
any
sort
of
a
setting
up
of
fee.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
your
court
is
familiar
that
new
york
held
that
a
50%
fee
is
an
unconscionable
fee.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
that's
correct,
nor
any
payments
by
lawyers
to
any
brotherhood
members
in
connection
with
the
procurement
of
the
case.
it's
fully
in
accord
with
the
illinois
decision.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
briefly,
i
would
say
that
the
constitutionally
protected
is
the
actions
and
the
speech
by
the
local
lodge
officer
when
he
makes
an
unsolicited
call
upon
an
injured
person
or
upon
a
deceased
person's
widow
both
of
them
having
suffered
the
injury
or
the
death
solely
in
railroad
employment,
and
he
states
to
that
person,
that
prospective
client,
that
"i
am
here
to
tell
you
that
it
is
the
policy
of
the
brotherhood
to
advise
you
and
to
recommend
that
you
retain
a
lawyer.
you
may
retain
your
own
lawyer
but
we
strongly
recommend
that
you
retain
the
legal
counsel
appointed
for
this
area
who
is
mr.
x."
we
feel
that,
under
those
circumstances,
this
is
a
mere
referral
without
compensation
and,
until
these
brotherhood
cases
came
along,
we
had
never
understood
and
i
think
the
bar
has
never
understood
that
such
referral
is
in
any
respect
unethical.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
we
feel
that
both
the
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
association,
as
stated
in
the
first
amendment,
protects
this.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes,
we
do
claim
that.
the
reason
i
didn't
state
that
in
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan
because
he
asked,
"what
do
we
do
in
regard
to
the
particular
injured
person?
"now,
insofar
as
this
case
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
that
had
been
the
practice
and
of
course
now
you
will
understand
as
mr.
stallard
stated
that
we
are
not
making
investigations
within
a
great
volume
that
we
had
done
previously.
this
had
come
to
the
point
where
it
is
economically
almost
impossible
for
the
union
to
continue
to
finance
this.
you
realize
the
great
volume
of
injuries
every
year
25,000
injuries
to
investigate
a
year
with
--
is
almost
an
intolerable
burden
for
this
union
to
assume,
especially
in
the
circumstances
that
it
is
now
in
with
the
national
rules
dispute
going
on.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
no,
that
is
not
correct.
we
spent
$85,000
in
19
--
in
part
of
1961,
as
the
record
shows.
we
didn't
have
any
budget,
and
that
was
only
for
eight
months
in
1961
so
that
the
cost
to
the
brotherhood
ran
approximately
$10,000
to
$11,000
a
month.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
that
is
primarily
salaries
and
transportation.
the
department
maintained
in
cleveland
had
a
chief
clerk
and
several
stenographers.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
didn't
say
that
500
case.
i
said
approximately
150
cases.
500
cases
were
filed
on
behalf
of
brotherhood
members
in
a
year,
i
would
suggest.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
would
assume
that
the
average
settlement
throughout
the
country
would
run
approximately
$8,000-$10,000
a
case
in
cases
handled
by
brotherhood
counsel.
so
that
their
fee,
if
they
charge
as
25%,
would
run
to
$2,000-$2,500
a
case
and
i
would
suggest
that
in
--
the
american
bar
suggest
there's
no
lack
of
competition
among
lawyers
for
these
cases,
and
i
would
agree
with
them,
provided,
they
say
there
is
no
lack
of
competition
among
lawyers
for
the
very
serious
injury
cases.
there
is
a
definite
lack
of
competition
among
lawyers,
among
lawyers
who
are
willing
to
handle
these
smaller
cases.
the
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
there
is
at
least
an
indirect
relationship
and
probably
a
direct
relationship.
the
illinois
case
specifically
states
that
the
counsels
are
located
in
what
are
deemed
high
verdict
areas.
the
trainmen
of
course,
in
making
their
plan
effective
wish
to
obtain
the
most
compensation
they
possibly
can
for
their
injured
members.
and
for
that
reason
i
--
i'm
certain
that
there
is
a
legal
counsel
appointed
who
has
offices
in
chicago
and
there
is
none
who
is
appointed
where
his
office
is
in
indiana,
the
general
feeling
being
that
indiana
is
a
lower
verdict
area
than
chicago.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
the
statute
gives
that
right
and
the
trainmen
obtain
the
statute,
i
think,
the
record
shows.
thank
you.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
the
only
state
i
know
that
has
such
a
statute
is
minnesota
where
there
is
a
30-day
period
in
which
a
contract
may
not
be
signed
releasing
a
client.
there
is
no
provision
in
that
statute.
the
claimant
may
or
may
not
advise
the
injured
person
that
he
should
not
go
to
the
brotherhood
counsel
or
that
he
should
not
go
to
any
counsel
or
that
a
particular
counsel,
i'm
sure,
will
see
you
and
of
course
you
don't
want
to
be
associated
with
a
person
like
him.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
here
are
none
that
i
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
there
are
no
statutes
that
i
know
that
bar
such.
i
understand
that
two
years
ago
there
were
such
statutes
in
some
instances.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
as
i
understand
the
--
this
case,
the
virginia
bar
doesn't
rely
on
any
provisions
of
virginia
statutes
whatsoever.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
they
rely
on
the
common
law.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes,
they
have
the
statute
struck
down
in
the
button
case.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
well,
as
i
understand
the
button
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor,
no.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
no,
they
are
not
but
that
statute,
i
think,
made
a
distinction
between
those
with
a
pecuniary
interest
and
those
without.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
are
not
involved
and
that
the
brotherhood
of
course
is
not
subject
to
the
canons
of
ethics,
and
the
rules
defining
the
practice
of
law
clearly
do
not
cover
this
situation.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
in
the
laws
to
understand
the
position
of
the
virginia
bar
association.
it
seems
to
me
that
as
stated
in
its
brief
and
as
stated
on
oral
argument
that
the
many
contradictory
aspects
have
been
at
the
--
the
same
time
urged
by
the
bar.
this
case
gets
down
it
seems
to
me
to
how
this
court
and
how
the
bar
would
feel
about
solicitation.
when
we
first
start
discussing
the
subject
of
solicitation,
i
think
it
is
important
to
mention
as
it
is
stated
in
the
case
of
in
re
haines
in
sixth
federal
supplement
467.
the
fact
that
somebody
says
that
someone
solicits
a
case
is
not
an
end
to
the
matter.
the
question
always
raised
in
these
cases
is,
is
the
solicitation
unethical,
illegal,
and
unlawful?
as
the
button
case
states,
was
there
a
malicious
purpose
in
mind
--
in
the
mind
of
the
solicitor?
the
record
in
this
case
is
clear.
there
is
no
such
malicious
purpose.
this
union
was
organized
many
years
ago
in
1885
and
it
was
organized
for
one
purpose
only.
to
tend
to
the
many
injuries
and
deaths
suffered
by
its
members.
the
organization
commenced
as
a
fraternal
insurance
association
providing
insurance
for
its
members
who
at
that
time
were
unable
to
obtain
insurance
from
any
insurance
company.
throughout
its
history
in
its
acts
of
1906
and
in
1908,
and
seeing
that
the
original
federal
employers
liability
act
become
a
statute
of
the
united
states
that
has
been
interested
in
the
injuries
and
the
debts
suffered
by
its
members.
today,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
is,
"does
this
court
recognize
the
rights
of
free
speech
to
recommend
and
refer?"
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
many
summaries
which
have
stated
that
an
uncompensation
--
uncompensated
recommendation
and
referral
has
never
been
held
to
be
a
violation
of
legal
ethics.
we
also
have
in
this
case
the
--
the
question
of
the
conflicts
between
the
union
members
and
members
of
the
bar.
many
years
ago
in
1937
for
example
when
mr.
savage
signed
his
contract
which
is
no
longer
a
contract
minding
either
him
or
the
brotherhood
but
has
been
avoided,
has
been
abrogated.
the
--
the
record
shows
clearly
that
it
was
a
letter
in
1946
which
was
written
to
all
legal
counsel
specifically
stating
that
the
brotherhood
had
no
financial
interest
in
the
cases
that
is
--
there
was
end
the
fee
splitting
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes
it
is
your
honor
and
it
is
there
by
a
way
of
a
letter
from
the
president
of
the
brotherhood
then
mr.
whitney
in
1940s.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
there
is
also
the
letter
mr.
bowles
referred
to.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
beg
you
pardon
mr.
justice
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes,
that
is
a
letter
of
1959
saying
to
the
counsel.
in
effect
your
lawyers,
we
--
we
intend
to
follow
the
illinois
decision.
you
read
the
decision
and
you
live
up
to
it.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
it's
in
the
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
832
or
833
i
believe
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
there
is
no
contract
that
is
effective
for
those
who
signed
the
original
contracts
and
for
some
of
the
man
who
now
have
the
designation,
they
have
never
at
anytime
they
have
held
the
designation
at
a
written
contract
with
the
brotherhood
or
a
contract
which
was
oral
containing
those
terms.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
mr.
savages'
contract
and
along
with
the
other
contracts
was
abrogated
both
in
1946
as
i
read
the
letter
of
president
whitney
to
mr.
(inaudible)
now
is
no
longer
a
counsel
for
the
brotherhood
and
by
the
letter
referred
to
by
mr.
bowles.
that
is
the
letter
of
mr.
kennedy
signed
the
illinois
decision
allows
us
do
certain
things
for
--
prohibits
us
from
doing
others,
we
expect
you
to
live
up
to.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
no,
your
honor
the
--
this
would
be
outside
of
the
record
of
course
but
the
--
there
is
no
contract
at
all.
we
have
sufficient
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
which
would
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
that's
correct
your
honor
and
i
think
there
would
be
a
very
small
number
of
counsels
who
are
still
with
us
from
1937.
many
of
them
have
died
or
retired,
have
been
replaced.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes
sir.
i
don't
--
in
any
event,
i
think
that
this
contract
is
illegal
document.
this
so-called
contract
is
denominated
rules
and
regulations.
i
think
it
was
an
agreement
between
the
counsel
and
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen
as
to
what
the
principles
were,
that
should
apply
in
their
handling
of
these
claims.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
wouldn't
so
ready
that
paragraph
your
honor.
i
think
that
should
be
read
but
it
is
impossible
to
control
their
choice
in
any
event.
but
that
they
certainly
have
a
right
to
choose
alternative
regional
counsel,
that
is
another
words
that
would
say
method
of
making
specific
but
not
only
could
they
reject
the
regional
counsel
tendered
but
they
could
reject
him
and
choose
another
regional
counsel.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
the
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
question
i
supposed
would
arise
in
this
manner,
a
regional
counsel
represented
a
client
and
then
he
settled
his
case
and
subsequently,
he
was
injured
again.
he
went
directly
to
the
regional
counsel
and
asked
him
to
handle
the
second
case
and
then
there
would
be
a
question
in
that
case,
was
that
a
brotherhood
case
or
was
it
a
case
that
the
man
got
by
virtue
of
personal
reputation?
so
it
was
--
as
part
of
these
rules
and
regulations
assume
that
anytime
the
man
was
a
member
of
the
brotherhood,
it
was
a
brotherhood
case.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
at
that
time,
i
think
there
was
a
--
there
were
two
separate
contracts.
the
brotherhood
had
a
contract
worth
obtained
5%
or
6%
of
the
gross
recovery
for
its
investigating
services.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
that
is
no
limiting.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
would
assume
that
may
have
been
one
of
the
purposes.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
would
say
this
decree
does
because
it
prohibits
the
giving
a
legal
advice.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
that
question
has
never
really
been
raised
in
any
case
except
the
doughty
versus
grills
case
and
there
it
was
raised
down
a
conjecture
and
speculation
out
of
the
evidence
of
the
brotherhood
was
given
legal
advice.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
oh,
in
1931,
this
plan
first
started.
mr.
mcgrath,
who
was
the
general
counsel
of
the
brotherhood,
specifically
advised
the
members
in
each
case
whether
they
have
a
claim.
of
course
that
was
back
in
the
time
when
there
was
assumption
of
risk
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
--
all
its
defenses
and
it
was
quite
complicated.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
it's
quite
different
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
to
say
that
when
i
know
a
man
who
was
injured
in
an
automobile
accident,
i
say
you
have
a
case
without
knowing
too
much
about
the
facts.
and
when
i,
as
a
lawyer,
examine
the
facts
and
say
so
and
so
is
liable
because
of
certain
legal
principles.
i
think
that
all
individuals
have
the
right
to
say
to
a
person,
"you
have
a
case
because
of
your
automobile
accident,"
or
because
of
your
injury
while
you're
at
work.
you
will
have
a
compensation
claim
because
you
were
injured
in
an
industry
covered
by
compensation.
i
don't
think
that's
giving
a
legal
advice.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
the
constitution
doesn't
provide,
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
--
that
authorize
them,
and
specifically
directs
the
--
a
local
lodge
officer
primarily
the
secretary
to
fill
out
forms
and
send
them
to
cleveland
for
statistical
purposes
and
also
to
recommend
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
and
that
has
started
out
the
general
fund
as
it's
shown
by
the
record.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
oh
we
would
agree
that
they
would
solicit.
and
we
are
--
we
have
a
subsidiary
point
that
says
that
they
don't
ethically
solicit
but
this
is
something
that
they
have
an
interest
in.
but
lawyers,
i
supposed
to
perform
services
for
people
and
that
the
facts
that
people
who
have
an
interest
recommend
the
service
of
the
lawyers
and
no
way
constitutes
an
unethical
practice.
but
assuming
that
it
is
unethical,
we
never
let's
say
that
the
constitution
prohibits
virginia
from
stopping
us
or
making
these
recommendations
and
referrals.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
would
assume
sir.
i
assume
mr.
bowles
conceded
that
and
answer
to
the
question
that
they
could
recommend
a
list
which
they
would
send
to
each
individual
member.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
would
say
it
would
and
i
would
also
say
the
illinois
opinion
would
go
that
far
because
they
states
specifically
we
can
recommend
them
generally
and
specifically.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
no.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
no
i
would
not
--
i
would
not
argue
that.
i
would
think
it's
a
different
situation
when
the
lawyer
is
involved
and
of
course
in
this
case,
the
lawyer
is
not
involved.
there
is
no
--
no
lawyer
that
it
was
a
party
of
the
union.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
and
you're
just
speaking
of
this
particular
case?
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes,
it's
about
the
brotherhood's
plan
in
relation
to
lawyers
but
there
is
no
lawyer
who
was
a
defendant
and
there
is
no
evidence
here
in
the
record
that
the
lawyers
are
advertising
or
--
or
publishing
pamphlets
which
they
are
circulating
with
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
my
answer
would
be
that
i
would
think
there
will
be
a
different
case
when
there
was
a
lawyer
involved.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes
i
would
think
so.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
you
--
you
are
assumed
or
speaking
of
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
would
say
probably
not,
there's
any
assumption
of
the
personal
manager
is
not
compensated
by
the
lawyer.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
don't
see
how
a
constitutionally
any
state
can
provide
any
person
from
recommending
the
lawyer
that
they
think
are
the
most
confident.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
think
it
would
be
unfair
to
call
it
solicitor.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
unfair.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
would
say
no
pay
as
one
of
the
distinction,
yes,
the
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
no
virginia
statute.
there's
a
virginia
injunction
a
--
action
based
on
the
common
law
and
i
think
that
on
the
common
law
barratry,
champerty
and
maintenances
there
is
not
a
--
slightness
similarity
between
the
acts
prohibited
in
those
doctrines
and
the
acts
here.
but
the
mere
fact
that
somebody
who
regularly
does
something
it
seems
to
me
doesn't
make
it
anymore
an
invidious
act
in
the
fact
that
he
does
it
occasionally.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
as
most
lawyers
would
do.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
would
say
that
the
--
assuming
that
the
personal
manager
was
uncompensated
but
he
would
have
the
right
to
recommend
the
lawyer
and
his
opinion
was
competent
to
handle
these
automobile
cases.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
even
though
he
did
it
as
a
regular
fund
and
that
this
was
constitutionally
protected.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
well,
i
also
think
that
of
course
he
would
not
have
the
benefit
of
the
federal
statutes
on
which
we
relied
for
stating
the
public
policy
of
the
united
states
on
these
merits.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
probably
soliciting
but
not
unethically
soliciting.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
do.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
don't
think
there's
anything
bad
about
solicitation
until
it
reaches
a
certain
point
where
it's
illegal.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
as
i
understand
out
of
the
virginia
laws,
if
they
would
have
a
compensation
claim,
they
would
be
subrogated
to
the
action
of
the
individual
injured,
did
not
bring
it
and
the
company
itself
could
bring
the
action.
