mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
justices.
before
i
forget
it,
in
the
brief
time
before
lunch
i
would
like
you
to
look
at
page
15
of
this
(inaudible)
brief.
i
believe
that's
what
the
printers
called
it,
and
you
will
see
the
answers
to
you
figures
the
letters
that
were
furnished
us
by
the
brotherhood.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
on
page
15.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
this
one,
this
yellow.
at
the
center
of
the
page,
you
will
see
that
the
book
show
that
in
1955,
which
is
the
latest
information
they
gave
us,
the
gross
settlements
are
$8,688,409
and
the
25%
fee
to
the
16
lawyers
was
$2,172,102.25.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
there
are
two
questions
which
i
think
in
about
two
minutes,
i
can
briefly
dispose
of
that
are
collateral
in
a
sense.
the
virginia
bar
has
conceded
in
its
brief
that
the
association
of
american
railroads
did
make
available
to
us
a
part
of
the
evidential
material
in
this
case,
for
which
we
are
indeed
most
grateful.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
they
did
make
available
to
us
certain
evidentiary
material.
the
case,
however,
is
not
a
contest
between
the
railroads
and
labor,
as
has
been
animated
to
you
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioner.
it
is
solely
and
only,
i
submit,
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
bar
of
virginia
to
preserve
its
own
integrity.
you
see,
under
this
plan,
we
have
never
had
a
lawyer
in
the
state
of
virginia
which,
in
the
opinion
of
the
brotherhood,
was
competent
to
handle
an
fela
case
which,
as
your
honors
as
--
will
recall,
certainly
with
the
assistance
given
by
the
court,
is
about
the
easiest
personal
injury
case
that
there
is
to
try.
it
is
solely
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
bar
of
virginia,
as
i
stated,
to
preserve
its
integrity.
now,
there's
another
point.
the
petitioner
filed
a
motion
here
to
require
the
respondent
to
pay
the
cost,
well
it
nearly,
of
all
cross
designations
that
we
made
for
printing.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
we
point
out
merely
the
fact
that,
had
we
not
done
so,
this
printed
record
would
not
have
shown
you
one
single
fact
that
would
intercalate
what
the
true
situation
is.
the
very
uplifting
of
all
of
the
glossary
matter
that
would
paint
them
in
shining
fashion
and
shining
armor,
being
wholly
and,
now,
true
instantly
interested
in
the
injured
member.1
that
is
not
a
fact,
i
submit,
as
the
record
will
show.
if
i
have
the
time
before
lunch,
i
would
like
to
briefly
undertake
to
explain
to
you
what
this
decree
is
and
what
its
basis
is.
it
is
admitted
here
in
the
answer
that
these
practices
and
these
illegal
practices
were
continued
in
virginia
and
everywhere
else
all
over
the
united
states
up
to
the
magic
date
of
april
1,
1959
a
very
appropriate
selection
in
the
way
of
date
because
that
happens
to
be
april
fool's
day.
they
admitted
that
they
did
this
prior
to
april
1,
that
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
i
was
undertaking
to
explain
our
view
of
the
basis
of
the
chancery
court
decree.
the
answer
in
this
proceeding
admitted
that
the
illegal
practices
complained
of
had
continued
in
virginia
and
elsewhere
in
the
united
states
up
to
april
1,
1959,
which
we
have
referred
to
during
this
trial
as
the
magic
date.
now,
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
yes
sir,
the
president
testified
that
illinois
supreme
court
had
given
them
one
year,
three
months
and
11
days
in
which
to
get
their
house
in
order
after
declaring
that
practice
is
illegal.
and
that
they
were
entitled
to
great
commendation
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
undertook
to
get
in
order
three
months
ahead
of
the
one
year,
three
months
and
11
days.
that
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that
was
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
i
don't
know
who
originated
that
sir.
it
was
not
with
the
idea
of
a
program.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
i
did,
yes
sir,
because
--
and
i'm
going
to
argue
to
you
why
it
was
april
fools'
day
in
just
a
moment,
because
it
was
and
has
been
for
30
years
just
exactly
--
that's
the
whole
complaint
of
the
virginia
state
law
over,
over,
over
and
over
again.
these
exact
protestations
have
been
made
and
have
not
been
followed.
they
have
now
been
made
and
are
not
being
followed,
that
is
our
position.
now,
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
yes
sir,
we
think
it
does.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
will
undertake
to
do
that.
now,
the
proof
shows
that
these
exact
same
protestations,
now
made,
were
made
in
the
past
and
were
not
lived
up
to.
it
has
been
shown
in
the
record
in
the
dworkin
case
that
that
case
was
dismissed
upon
the
statement
that
their
whole
plan
had
been
revised
and
they
would
not
do
anymore
of
these
illegal
things.
there
is
a
--
the
answer
admits
that
notwithstanding
that,
these
practices
were
continued
until
april
1,
1959.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
the
complaint
was
filed
in
virginia
in
june
of
1959
sir,
june
the
19th
i
think.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
in
virginia?
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that
is
why
i
undertook
to
explain
to
you
the
basis
of
this
decree.
the
answer
said
that
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
what
is
that?
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
mr.
savage
contributed
$6800
to
the
legal
aid
department,
just
a
moment
sir
i'll
tell
you
the
date.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
yes
sir.
1204
is
the
place
in
volume
iv,
that's
the
financial
records
of
the
--
of
the
legal
aid.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
1204
and
mr.
savages'
specific
contribution
is
indicated.
the
test
is
tumbling
if
your
honor
please
but
i
--
that's
at
page
1245
of
volume
iv.
it
will
be
shown
that
in
august
19th,
1959,
mr.
savage
paid
to
the
legal
aid
department
$6800.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that
is
the
contention
that
was
made
but
i
think
that
is
not
accurate
because
the
record
will
also
show
that
the
--
i
have
not
had
the
opportunity
to
develop
to
you
just
the
--
the
way
that
these
financial
records
were
managed
then
i
will
undertake
to
do
so
now.
this
specific
--
specific
check
was
a
check
which
was
made
out
--
or
directed
to
be
made
out
by
the
president.
it
was
sent
to
the
legal
aid
department,
the
stub
of
the
check
is
at
1246
in
the
record.
mr.
savage
had
sent
bills
for
personal
services
to
the
brotherhood
in
amount
of
$6800
which
is
on
page
1247.
now,
that
was
then
ordered
to
make
out
a
check
to
mr.
savage.
it
was
sent
to
the
legal
aid
department.
the
legal
aid
department
then
sent
it
back
to
the
general
fund
to
the
credit
of
mr.
savage.
that's
the
way
that
transaction
was
done.
now,
that
$6800
was
in
part
the
reimbursement
to
the
brotherhood
for
the
use
of
a
man
named
tingle
who
was
then
a
regional
investigator
and
who
was
assigned
by
the
legal
aid
department
to
mr.
savage
for
his
use.
in
other
words,
that
tingle
was
paid
by
the
brotherhood's
legal
aid
department
but
reimbursed
by
legal
counsel.
and
those
current
operations
went
on
as
you
had
stated
this
morning
until
april,
those
are
all
mixed
up
in
that
$6800.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
the
services
of
tingle
were
performed
right
down
to
april.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
april
of
1960
sir.
but
the
services
of
mr.
savage
as
there's
nothing
--
beg
pardon?
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
you
are
quite
right
sir.
that
--
that
is
correct.
it
was
down
to
august
of
1959,
the
current
reimbursement
of
by
the
month.
i
--
i
was
skipping
in
my
own
mind
to
another
similar
situation
of
some
$10,000
which
happened
over
in
1960,
the
same
result.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
a
contract
for
what
sir,
for
the
vast
services
of
a
lawyer
or
an
investigator?
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
part
of
it
was
reimbursement
for
the
investigator
for
the
investigator
for
the
immediately
prior
month.
part
of
it
was
the
services
that
mr.
savage
had
rendered,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
oh,
back
in
1937
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
1937.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that's
when
mr.
savage
signed
his
contract
with
the
brotherhood.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
the
date
of
the
service
is
rendered
by
mr.
savage,
i
do
not
know
sir.
the
record
does
not
disclose.
it
was
just
a
bill
for
services
rendered.
the
--
it
doesn't
specify.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
what's
that
sir?
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
intended
to
come
to
that
and
to
ask
you
to
examine
that
contract
in
detail
because
the
main
feature
of
that
contract
is
the
obligation
to
provide
the
advance
advertisement
that
would
result
in
an
assurance
or
guarantee
to
this
regional
counsel
of
a
sufficient
volume
of
business
to
--
to
permit
them
to
do
this
business
at
a
reduced
rate
that
is
set
out
in
the
contract.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
most
of
these
is
written
down
in
our
briefs
sir
so
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
i'm
not
opt-in
to
explain
that
to
you
yet.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
the
question
as
to
how
many
cases
there
were
in
virginia.
and
the
answer
to
that
will
answer
your
question
simply
because
mr.
kennedy,
the
president
of
the
brotherhood,
testified
that
as
soon
as
this
suit
was
commenced
and
a
suit
shows
that
there
was
a
long
period
of
conversation
between
the
committee
of
the
bar
and
the
brotherhood
before
that.
but
as
soon
as
these
questions
were
raised,
that
he
stopped
all
business
in
virginia
of
every
kind,
and
that
there
was
no
service
rendered
to
any
virginia
member
of
the
brotherhood
during
dependency
of
this
contest
between
the
bar
and
the
brotherhood.
now
sir,
that
being
so,
mr.
savage
--
mr.
savage
would
not
even
come
into
virginia
so
that
he
could
be
served,
neither
would
--
did
mr.
tingle.
and
they
claim
that
there
was
no
business
done,
awaiting,
as
mr.
kennedy
said,
the
pleasure
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
or
the
chancery
court
to
tell
him
in
virginia
what
he
could
do.
now,
as
i
started
to
explain,
the
basis
of
this
decree
is
predicated
upon
the
fact
that
they
say
prior
to
april
1,
1959,
they
did
not
do
this
either
in
virginia
or
anywhere
else.
and
the
proof
here
shows
that
we
could
not
find
a
case
in
virginia
where
this
was
done.
but
we
found
some
seven
or
eight
others
in
other
places
where
they
had
done
this
exact
same
things
which
they
had
it
in
some
dozens
of
instances
before,
claim
they
would
not
do
it
and
then
go
on
right
back
to
it
as
soon
as
the
heat
was
off.
but
under
that
basis,
this
chancellor
had
the
present
apprehension
which
we
have
a
statute
to
that
effect
that
gave
him
jurisdiction
to
apprehend
that
the
thing
would
be
resumed
in
virginia
as
it
had
admittedly
been
done
prior
to
april
1,
1954.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
1959,
yes
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that
is
--
that
i
think
is
the
fact
according
to
this
record,
that's
a
fact.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
i
don't
think
so
mr.
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
i
--
i
didn't
hear
that
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
they
do
not
seem
to
be
disturbed
by
that.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that
is
the
class
that
where
the
--
the
thing
in
modern
(inaudible)
situation.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
i
think
so
and
i
will
undertake
them
to
address
my
further
remarks
on
just
that
question.
now,
before
doing
so
though,
i
would
like
to
call
to
your
attention
the
fact
that
the
position
of
the
bar
before
the
chancellor
was
that
to
proof
here
shows
that
they
were
still
doing
these
things
and
that
there
was
a
reasonable
apprehension
that
they
might
recommence
them
in
virginia
because
we
showed
without
any
dispute
whatever
that
notwithstanding
the
sworn
answer
in
compliance
with
calls
and
affidavit
to
their
effect
that
no
legal
counsel
that
paid
any
money
to
anybody
else
into
this
legal
aid
department
for
any
reason
after
the
april
1,
1959.
and
we
--
the
proof
shows
that
it
was
paid
up
until
april
18,
1960.
now,
we've
been
over
the
reasons
for
this
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
in
other
--
in
any
state.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
yes,
mr.
savage
paid
some
money,
$6800
on
august
the
19th
of
1959.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
in
virginia,
yes
sir.
well,
i
said
in
virginia
your
honor,
he's
a
baltimore
lawyer.
he
is
not
licensed
to
practice
law
in
virginia
and
the
brotherhood
recommends
him
as
their
only
lawyer
anywhere
in
this
region
that
is
competent
to
handle
these
cases.
so
we
have
no
lawyer
in
virginia,
ever
have
had
a
lawyer
in
virginia.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
sir?
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
oh
yes
sir,
virginia
cases.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that
i
--
i
do
not
know
that
sir.
they
were
for
personal
services
rendered
to
the
brotherhood
apparently
for
other
reasons
than
the
fela
case.
now,
the
respondent
first
contends
if
your
honors
please,
that
there
really
is
no
questions
for
this
court
to
determine
because
an
examination
of
this
decree
shows
very
clearly
in
our
view
that
the
thing
that
they
say
they
want
the
right
to
do,
namely,
to
tell
their
members
that
they
ought
to
get
counsel
before
they
settle
a
case
and
to
recommend
the
name
of
a
competent
lawyer.
nobody
can
possibly
complain
of
that.
all
of
us
lawyers
get
a
--
a
practice
by
a
virtue
of
reputation.
and
to
john
jones
may
say
that
so
and
so
is
a
good
lawyer.
and
when
the
thing
stops
there,
there
can
be
no
complaint
by
the
bar
or
by
anyone
else.
now,
if
that
is
so
as
to
what
they
contend
that
that
is
the
purpose
and
--
of
--
of
their
intention,
by
this
plan
then
there
is
not
one
single
thing
in
this
decree
of
the
chancery
court
of
the
city
of
richmond
that
prohibits
that.
and
the
finding
of
fact
you
will
notice
says,
as
to
some
of
these
facts
that
they
find
that
they
have
done
them
in
the
past
and
still
continue
to
do
them
as
to
other
facts,
however,
the
finding
as
only
that
they
have
done
them
in
the
past.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
what
is
that
sir?
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
are
you
looking
at
this
blue
one?
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
from
holding
out
lawyers
selected
by
--
there's
the
only
approved
lawyers
to
aid
the
members
of
their
families.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
i
don't
think
so
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
i
don't
--
that
is
not
my
understanding
of
those
words.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
it
--
it
means
that
where
all
of
the
other
things
behind
it
that
i
shall
presently
relate
to
you,
that
this
is
the
only
lawyer
that
you
can
or
should
go
to.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
yes,
and
--
and
--
but
along
with
all
the
rest
of
these
things
on
the
basis
of
solicitation
so
that
it
results
as
these
gentlemen
have
just
admitted
that
the
one
lawyer
gets
one-third
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
--
of
all
the
legal
business
that
there
is.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
oh
yes.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
yes.
yes,
sir
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
the
--
the
word
only
undertakes
to
take
care
of
that
that
there
is
no
other
lawyer
in
virginia,
maryland,
district
of
columbia,
west
virginia,
in
their
opinion
of
the
brotherhood
that
is
competent
to
handle
an
fela
case.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
well,
the
prohibition
is
from
holding
out
lawyers
selected
by
it
as
the
only
approved
lawyers
to
aid
the
members
of
their
family.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
yes,
that's
correct
and
that
ties
right
back
in
to
the
findings
of
the
court
which
i'm
going
to
review
to
you
in
a
moment
as
to
what
this
contract
that
that
lawyer
makes
with
the
union.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
undertake
now
to
speak
in
advance
the
unauthorized
practice
committee
of
the
virginia
state
bar,
but
i
express
to
you
my
view
that
without
all
of
the
prior
things
that
go
on
in
this
plan,
i
don't
think
you
can
pick
out
one
thing
in
this
plan
without
looking
at
the
plan
as
a
hope.
that
without
all
of
that,
that
the
man
goes
and
says,
just
as
somebody
might
--
shall
i
say
i
hope,
say
above
me
someday.
i
recommend
russell
bowles.
he's
a
very
good
lawyer.
now,
if
that's
where
the
thing
starts
and
where
it
ends,
i
don't
think
anybody
can
complain
of
it.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
there
is
a
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that
is
exactly
the
point
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
the
whole
secret
of
it,
if
you
will
turn
and
i'll
jump
over
four
pages
of
my
argument,
turn
to
page
20
of
the
reply
brief.
and
now,
you
have
the
crux
of
the
whole
thing.
on
page
20
of
the
reply
brief,
that's
this
gray.
they
say
the
only
three
things
that
worry
them
about
this
decree
are,
from
holding
out
lawyers
selected
by,
there's
the
only
approved
lawyers
or
in
any
manner,
soliciting
or
encouraging
such
legal
employment,
that's
one
of
the
thing
that
they
don't
like.
they
want
to
solicit
they
say
and
they
have
a
right
to,
they
claimed,
or
any
commendation
of
things.
there
results
in
exactly,
justice
stewart,
what
you
said
a
moment
ago
when
the
proof
of
the
putting
is
in
the
heating,
that
it
always
winds
up
in
the
particular
man.
now,
but
look
into
next
page
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that
is
not
all
what
i
claim
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
i
--
but
i
was
undertaking
to
show
you
right
then
when
you
asked
me
that
question.
you
turn
to
page
21,
their
answer
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
well
sir,
the
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
of
course,
there's
no
trouble
with
that,
certainly.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
but
the
court
didn't
sue
what
your
premise
was.our
court
didn't
say
that,
sir.
i
have
to
disagree
with
you,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
my
court
said
that
they
did
it
wrong
in
the
past.
they
said,
they
would
not
do
it
anymore,
anywhere.
and
in
seven
different
places
since
then,
they
have
done
it
wrong
which
makes
my
court
believe
that
they
will
do
what
they
have
done
in
the
past,
namely
promised
they
wouldn't
and
do
it
again.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
well,
that
means
that
i
must
review
right
now,
which
i
had
intended
doing
from
the
record
very
briefly,
what
this
plan
is.
first
of
all,
it
is
a
contract
agreement
between
the
lawyers,
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
there's
nothing
in
the
illinois
decree
that
forbids
this.
there
is
nothing
in
their
brief
or
anywhere
else
that
says
what
i'm
telling
you
now
isn't
still
going
on.
there's
no
denial
of
it
that
they
entered
into
a
contract
which
says
in
effect,
"if
you
will
appoint
me
to
be
the
lawyer
in
this
region,
then
i
agree
to
do
certain
things
namely,
to
handle
your
fela
cases
on
a
25%
commission
instead
of
a
higher
one.
and
i
agree
that
i
will
pay
all
the
expenses
involved
in
the
trial,
such
as,
getting
witnesses'
fees
and
medical
testimony
and
that
i
will
investigate
the
case
and
pay
all
those
expenses.
and,
that
if
i
will
do
all
of
those
things,
you
will
undertake
by
a
system
of
advertising
of
me,
the
lawyer,
to
all
of
your
members
in
such
a
way
that
i
will
be
assured
of
a
sufficient
whole
--
sufficient
volume
of
business
in
order
to
warrant
me
doing
this
business
on
a
wholesale
basis."
now,
that's
the
contract
that
they
signed.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that's
what
i
was
coming
to
a
moment
ago.
that
contract
and
it's
the
advocacy
of
that
is
what
they
want
to
do
as
i
was
about
to
show
you.
look
at
page
8888
--
8888,
that
is
in
volume
ii
sir.
now,
this
is
a
contract
that
mr.
savage
signed
back
in
1937.
the
purpose
of
it
is
stated
in
the
first
paragraph.
regional
lawyers
will
be
selected
in
various
railroad
centers
in
the
united
states
with
a
view
to
rendering
the
service
contemplated
by
the
establishment
of
the
legal
aid.
and
the
total
membership
in
a
given
districts
so
as
to
give
regional
lawyers
a
reasonable
assurance
of
a
sufficient
volume
of
brotherhood
business
to
warrant
their
rendering
of
proper
service
on
the
basis
of
compensation
agreed
upon.
now,
mr.
savage
signed
that
contract
as
you
will
see
over
at
page
8982.
i
think
that's
where
he
said
it
back,
right
at
page
891
and
he
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
1937
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
1937
and
he's
been
operating
under
that
contract
and
so
far
as
i
know,
and
this
record
shows,
he
is
now
operating
under
this
contract.
it
has
been
amended
by
letters,
saying
that
he
can't
split
fees.
but
it
has
never
been
amended
to
show
that
the
brotherhood
is
not
sending
his
name
daily,
monthly,
weekly,
by
its
publications,
by
its
directories,
by
seculars,
by
officiaries,
meetings,
and
which
he's
allowed
to
speak
and
tell
him
what
a
great
lawyer
he
is
and
how
many
great
cases
he
has
won
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
in
other
words,
this
is
a
--
a
number
1
madison
avenue
pre-mind
conditioning
that
if
you
ever
have
an
accident,
this
is
the
lawyer
you
must
employ.
and
that's
a
contract
that
they've
entered
into.
now,
that
is
the
thing
that
we
are
after,
mark
if
your
honors
please,
that
somebody
who
is
a
friend.
incidentally,
there
is
proof
shows,
generally,
those
friends
who
went
to
go
and
tell
the
man
about
his
rights,
got
paid
off
anywhere
from
$150
up
to
$1000.
but
the
--
this
is
not
an
objection
of
the
virginia
state
bar
and
then
a
friend
should
go
to
a
man
and
say,
"i
--
i
know
my
cousin
uptown."
you
will
find
in
this
record
where
these
regional
lawyers,
get
into
realms
with
themselves,
trying
to
see
whose
going
to
get
the
case
that
you
--
one
or
the
other
is
going
to
get
and
they
begin
to
hold
them
away
from
each
other.
there
is
a
case
of
that
sort
in
this
record
established
where
within
one
day,
after
a
girl
came
back
from
a
hospital,
after
having
giving
birth
to
a
baby,
three
days
after
her
husband
was
killed
on
the
railroad,
she
was
assailed
on
the
first
day
of
her
return
by
reason
of
counsel
in
atlanta.
and
on
the
third
day
after
her
return,
by
the
chairman
of
the
whole
brotherhood
on
a
particular
georgia
railroad
trying
to
take
it
to
mr.
reeves
over
in
birmingham,
so
they
were
competing
with
one
another.
that
is
that
they
agreed
of
trying
to
break
up.
not
the
question
of
what
i
hope
my
friends
do
for
me
is
to
recommend
me,
but
you
will
find
in
the
hideous
deposition,
right
in
the
state
of
illinois,
that
happened
after
april
1,
1959,
that
these
people
came
after
mr.
hughes
so
much
and
so
often
and
so
frequently
until
mr.
hughes
had
a
nervous
breakdown
at
the
solicitation.
that
is
in
this
record.
that
is
the
reason
that
the
record
is
so
voluminous
because
those
cases
had
to
be
shown
in
order
to
show
this
court
exactly
what
has
been
going
on
and
what
we
believe
is
still
going
on.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
so
many
works
did
not
jump
on
solicitation
perceived.
the
illinois
supreme
court
said
we
are
greatly
embarrassed
by
the
prior
decision
of
our
intermediate
court
that
said
this
was
a
wonderful
plan.
the
--
and
on
that
account,
we
will
not
administer
any
disciplinary
measure
against
the
union.
they
said,
"you
cannot
have
a
man
that
will
go
out
and
carry
a
contract
to
sign
and
to
fill
it
up."
they
said,
"you
can't
split
fees."
they
said
that
you
can't
in
the
thudding
of
this
thing.
you
cannot
carry
around
checks
showing
what
the
great
settlements
we've
made
in
the
past.
and
you
cannot
make
contributions
to
the
legal
aid
department.
but
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
not
say,
you
cannot
advertise
this
man
ahead
of
time
to
the
point
that
everybody
is
brainwashed
already
if
you
have
a
--
have
an
accident,
the
whole
force
of
the
whole
thing
converges
upon
him
to
get
him
into
the
hands
of
one
single
lawyer.
now,
you'll
note,
the
contention
is
not
their
right
to
recommend
a
competent
lawyer.
the
contention
is
to
recommend
a
competent
lawyer
selected
by
me,
the
president,
under
my
control
that
i
think
is
competent,
not
the
man
who
is
going
to
have
the
case.
now,
the
president
has
said,
and
i
believe
you
asked
the
question
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
about
the
control
of
fees.
the
control
of
fees
still
exists.
mr.
kennedy
testified
that
if
anybody
charged
more
than
he
thought
he
ought
to
charge,
he'd
fire
him
as
reason
of
counts.
and
i
said
to
him,
"mr.
kennedy,
you
do
control
the
situation,
do
you
not?"
and
he
said,
"to
that
extent."
because
the
constitution
shows
and
the
whole
case
shows
that
the
sole
control
of
this
department
is
in
one
man,
the
president,
under
the
constitution
and
he's
the
only
man
that
can
approve
anything
that's
done
in
there.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
what
is
that
sir?
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
printed
here.
i'm
not
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
there
are
five
or
four
directories
that
are
--
they
are
quarterly
directories
and
for
one
year
on
a
quarter,
i
think.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
yes
sir,
949
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
949
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
i
think
there
had
been
one.
all
of
these
people
are
members
of
the
brotherhood.
i
think
one
man
has
died.
i'm
not
too
clear
about
that.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
changes
at
the
end
of
that
volume
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
no
sir,
that
would
probably
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
which
one?
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that
is
right
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
when
i
was
asked
the
question,
i
was
right
on
that
point
sir,
so
if
you'll
turn
to
page
21,
you
will
see
that
is
what
they
want
to
do.
next
page
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
i
think
so
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that
of
course
the
third
thing
is
what
makes
it
wrong.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that's
right
now
--
now
you
see,
that
is
illustrated.
turn
to
page
21,
the
very
next
page
you're
looking
at,
right
at
the
middle
of
the
page.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
of
the
gray
brief,
that
--
their
reply
brief.
such
decree
prohibits
the
petitioner
from
any
effective
advocacy
to
its
members.
that's
page
21.
now,
of
the
advisability
of
obtaining
legal
advice
before
making
settlement
of
that
claims,
now
the
state
bar
doesn't
objective
to
people
advocating
that
you
get
legal
advice
before
you
settle
a
claim.
but
the
next
thing
they
do
--
we
do
object
to
namely,
the
effective
--
effectively
and
successful,
effective
advocacy
to
its
members,
two
of
the
recommendation
of
particular
attorneys
to
handle
such
claim.
now,
you
will
see
what
they
mean
by
that
if
you'll
turn
to
page
27
of
this
brief,
and
look
right
in
the
middle
of
that
and
you
will
find
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that's
where
it
gets
done.
that's
right
sir.
now,
because
you
will
see
on
page
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
of
course
not
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
it's
the
solicitation
agent
for
these
lawyers.
that's
what
it
is.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that
is
correct.
they
tried
to
get
under
the
button
umbrella.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that's
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that
is
our
position
sir.
so,
now
you'll
see
that's
what
they
want
to
do
by
looking
at
page
27.
after
a
recital
that
all
lawyers
except
the
union
lawyers
are
hostile
to
union
members,
which
i
think
is
a
very
erroneous
assumption,
says,
because
of
this
hostility,
the
only
effective
way
to
see
that
union
members
obtain
legal
advice
is
to
permit
group
referral
to
union
lawyers.
this
is
that
basis
of
the
petitioner's
plan.
now,
they
can
see
that
that's
a
basis
of
their
plan.
now,
the
next
summon
step
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
exactly
so.
if
they
can
do
it,
the
atlantic
and
pacific
tea
company
can
do
it.
anybody
can
do
it.
i
can
get
up
at
bunch
that
can
solicit
for
me.
i
don't
see
how
it
can
sanctify
an
illegal
act
because
it's
a
union.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
yes,
but
there
is
no
political
right
here
involved.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that's
right
sir.
now,
i
read
the
next
sentence
on
page
27
and
you
will
see
exactly
what
they
have
in
mind.
they
say
that
the
right
to
freedom
of
speech
--
now,
the
right
to
freedom
of
speech
and
the
right
to
freedom
of
association,
that
fundamental
right
permits
the
brotherhood
to
advocate
their
employment
of
those
lawyers
in
whom
the
brotherhood
has
competence.
alright,
it
isn't
a
question
of
recommending.
it's
a
question
of
solicitation,
advocating
and
when
we
get
to
question
of
where
there
is
a
financial
interest
--
i've
just
read
to
you
that
in
1955,
the
interest
was
something
over
$2.5
million.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
well,
now
i've
got
a
whole
section
on
that,
so
i
was
hoping
to
get
to
it.
but
before
we
leave
888
in
this
record,
i
wish
you
would
note
the
other
things
in
this
contract.
they're
advertising.
when
the
regional
lawyers
are
selected
and
from
time-to-time
thereafter,
articles
will
be
published
in
the
trainmen's
general
informing
members
of
the
services
rendered
by
the
legal
aid
department
and
advising
them
also
of
the
names
and
addresses
of
regional
lawyers.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
there
is
no
contention
that
they
have
been
other
than
modified
by
the
letter
of
mr.
kennedy
which
said,
"you
must
follow
the
illinois
decision
in
regard
to
splitting
fees
and
making
contributions
of
money."
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that
letter
is
--
that
letter
is
at
page
958
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that
is
page
958,
which
says
in
a
compliance
have
said
opinion
and
illegal
counsel
who
represents
the
brotherhood
is
hereby
instructed
and
required
to
live
up
the
said
opinion
in
its
entirety.
the
brotherhood
will
finance
the
legal
aid
department,
will
investigate
accidents.
that
puts
me
in
mind
to
answer
one
other
question
and
that
is,
that
the
letter
also
and
instructions
from
mr.
kennedy
provide
--
they
said
they
don't
have
any
investigators
now.
what
the
local
lodge
secretary
is
now
under
the
constitution,
ordered
to
do
the
same
thing
that
the
prior
investigator
did
out
of
the
grant
laws.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
well
now,
if
your
honor
please,
in
our
state,
we
have
legal
aid
and
the
bar
that
participates
in
it.
one
of
the
criticisms
of
this
whole
thing
with
--
was
a
misnomer
of
this
department.
legal
aid
is
supposedly
as
i
understand
it,
and
--
and
we,
in
virginia,
understand
it,
to
be
for
indigent
people
and
the
legal
aid
in
virginia
is
prohibited
from
accepting
any
contingent
fee
contract
in
a
case
that
is
worthwhile
to
any
lawyer.
so
we're
not
dealing
with
that
sort
of
thing
here
at
all.
and
incidentally,
this
record
also
shows
but
mr.
kennedy
said
that
the
--
that
the
brotherhood
and
the
legal
aid
department
wasn't
interested
in
any
of
these
cases
except
the
big
ones.
now,
that's
in
his
testimony.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
they
could
solicit
them
to
file
a
suit.
i
believe
that
would
be
common
law
amendments
as
we
understand
it
in
our
state.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
i
think
so
sir.
if
--
if
it
was
on
the
basis
of
solicitation.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
exactly
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
exactly
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
motive
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
too,
so
far
as
i
can
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
yes.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
now
you
see
this
plan
sets
up
what
seems
to
me
is
sort
of
an
elaborate
early
warning
system
to
these
people
who
they
are
engaged
in
a
dangerous
activity.
there's
no
question
about
that.
and
they
are
unquestionably
likely
to
have
an
accident
and
they
are
told
in
advance.
the
man
you
heard
at
the
(inaudible)
last
friday
is
the
only
man
in
this
whole
area
that
knows
enough
about
this
thing
to
give
you
a
square
deal,
and
to
get
you
a
square
deal.
and
they
undertake
to
argue,
that
all
railroad
clear
maidens,
thieves
and
robbers
who
have
steal,
that's
--
that's
the
motive
upon
which
the
plan
was
done.
it
was
that
those
people
would
do
your
deck.
now,
we
get
around
to
them
that
this
is
a
composite
thing.
it
begins
with
the
original
proposition
of
saying
we've
set
up
a
plan,
we've
designated
the
lawyer,
we
advertised
him,
we
agree
that
in
--
in
turn
for
your
agreement
to
do
this
the
way
we
want
it
done,
we
will
see
that
you
get
the
volume.
and
if
you
read
on
--
on
those
pages
of
888,
you
will
see
that
the
elements
of
control,
the
control
fees,
the
solicitation
and
splitting
of
fees
are
all
in
that
contract.
now,
it
has
been
modified
with
respect
to
the
splitting
of
fees.
we
do
not
think
from
this
record
that
that
is
necessarily
a
fact.
but
we
frankly
concede
we
have
no
proof
of
it.
now,
the
question
was
asked
about
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
i
don't
know
of
any
statute.
we
have
a
statute
today,
as
you
can
use
as
any
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
--
statement
that
a
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that's
a
subject
of
great
debate
in
virginia
whether
we
have
a
maintenance
statute
or
not.
the
adjustable
--
objectionable
parts
of
it
fall
out
or
did
the
whole
thing
go
down.
that's
being
debated
in
our
general
assembly
right
now,
meeting.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
i
commence
this
suit
and
i
did
not
undertake
to
rely
on
any
statutes
except
the
one
that
i
set
out
in
my
brief
at
the
beginning.
of
course
we
rely
upon
the
apprehension
statute,
which
says
who
can
practice
law
and
who
can't
and
there
is
the
right
of
injunction.
this
one
was
not
stricken
down
by
the
button
case.
there
is
a
right
of
injunction
by
the
congress'
attorney
from
any
--
against
anybody
from
soliciting
any
claim
against
any
person,
firm
or
corporation
subject
to
the
date
of
the
injunction.
now,
that
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
sir,
and
a
person,
firm
or
corporation.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
all
hands
sir,
off
the
top
of
my
head,
i
don't
recall
of
anything
prohibiting
that
but
we
do
have
a
statute
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
do
not
think
so.
that
is
not
soliciting
somebody
to
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
i
don't
see
how
the
lawyer
of
the
company
would
participate
in
that
transaction
at
all.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
i
wouldn't
know
about
that
sir.
i
know
that
the
contracts
have
been
in
advance,
approved
by
lawyers,
the
all
costs.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
to
the
claim
department,
i
had
--
from
what
your
question
infers
that
the
claim
agent
is
going
out
and
doing
that.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that
i
would
not
know,
sir,
that
whether
they're
lawyers
or
whether
they're
not
lawyers
but
if
they
are
--
i
--
i'd
--
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
they
have
a
financial
interest
in
the
contract.
they
are
the
people
that
--
i've
got
to
pay
the
money
in
the
end
and
not
the
name
of
the
show.
the
name
of
the
show,
it
doesn't
pay
the
money.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
not
by
virtue
of
the
injury,
by
virtue
of
the
contract
with
the
lawyer.
they're
only
having
answers
in
the
injury.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
there's
any
state
i
know
off
that
where
you
can
assign
an
interest
in
a
personal
injury.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
well,
that
would
not
necessarily
be
an
assignment
of
a
--
of
an
interest.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
well,
may
i
--
may
i
seek
refuge
in
the
fact
that
it
wouldn't
be
a
legal
financial
interest
that
would
be
protected.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that
i
understand
is
a
plan
that
is
now
being
devised
in
order
to
get
that
kind
of
an
interest.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that
i
understand
is
a
plan
that
is
now
being
devised
by
this
union
in
order
to
get
that
sort
of
interest.
that's
what
i
have
heard.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
i
understand
sir.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
(inaudible)
sir.
could
i
have
saved
three
minutes
to
do
it
here.
now,
there
--
there
--
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
has
interpreted
in
the
button
case
as
i
understand
it,
undertake
to
say
that,
well
first
shall
i
say
this.
the
button
case
starts
off,
by
recognizing
the
state's
interest
in
regulating
the
"tradition
on
an
illegal
practice
of
barratry,
maintenance
and
champerty".
now
that
the
assumption
and
credibleness
upon
which
i
understood
your
opinion
to
start
sir.
now,
from
time
immemorial
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
the
rights
of
the
states
to
regulate
the
practice
of
the
law
and
the
professions,
and
if
we
get
to
that
point
really
what
the
question
and
real
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
that
practice
in
law
is
a
profession
or
whether
it's
a
business.
now,
if
it's
a
business,
there's
no
difficulty
about
regulating
the
--
them
doing
the
things
that
they
want.
but
if
it
is
a
profession,
it
is
the
only
profession
i
submit
in
which
the
courts
and
this
court
has
the
inherent
power
to
regulate.
it's
the
only
one.
now,
you've
regulated
dentist
from
hanging
a
tooth
outside
the
window,
you
have
regulated
various
and
sundry
professions
on
the
ground
that
a
state
has
a
proper
right
to
do
that
and
you
have
seen
some
magnificent
things
in
assembler
case
for
example.
the
community
is
concerned
with
the
maintenance
of
professional
standards
which
will
ensure
not
only
competency
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
now,
in
this
situation,
as
well
as
in
(inaudible),
this
court
has
never
expressed
a
doubt
about
the
states
prior
right
to
regulate
the
profession
that
overrides
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
now,
the
exemption
that
was
made
in
the
--
in
button
as
i
understand
it
if
i
read
the
majority
opinion
there
correctly,
is
that
that
interest
does
not
justify
their
prohibition
of
the
n.a.a.c.p.
activities
disclosed
by
this
record.
now,
the
activities
that
were
disclosed
by
that
record
were
that
they
were
modes
of
political
expression
which
were
undertaken
and
used
to
protect
constitutionally
guaranteed
rights.
neither
of
those
exists
in
this
situation.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
a
federally
created
right,
anybody
that
gets
hurt
has
the
right
to
sue
for
injury
if
it's
a
negligent
accident.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
he
only
has
the
right
to
get
relieved
of
the
common
law
difficulties.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
that
is
correct
sir,
and
he
sues
under
a
federal
statute.
but
i
do
not
see
the
political
aspect
of
that
in
connection
with
a
constitutional
and
guaranteed
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
do
not
understand
that
the
right
to
sue
for
a
personal
injury
is
necessarily
a
constitutionally
guaranteed
right.
but
all
of
that
maybe
if
your
honor
please,
there
is
no
political
aspect
under
as
clearly
on
this
record,
the
very
material
financial
aspect
which
you
may
have
great
point
of
saying
was
not
present
in
button.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
no
sir,
i
think
that
the
regulation
of
it
and
there's
nothing
in
this
decree
that
prevents
the
individual
present
for
doing
that.
there
isn't
--
there
isn't
anything
in
this
decree
that
prevents
recommending
a
lawyer.
there
is
in
this
decree
something
that
prevents
going
out
and
running
and
capping
and
getting
all
the
cases
for
him
that
you
can.
that's
what
prohibited.
well,
i
see
that
my
time
is
practically
up.
i
submit
if
your
honors
please,
that
the
practice
of
law
is
not
alright.
it
is
a
privilege
conferred
by
the
state.
now,
we
live
under
the
government,
under
law
and
this
court
has
many
times
approved
the
proposition
that
a
minute
a
member
of
the
bar
becomes
a
member
of
the
bar.
he's
part
in
the
puzzle
of
the
government
under
law
and
a
member
of
the
process
of
administration
of
justice.
now,
if
the
survival
of
government
under
law
is
going
to
succeed
then
it
is
not
to
depend
upon
the
respect
that
the
public
has
and
the
citizenry
for
the
administration
of
justice.
and
then
tell
you
to
the
lawyer
under
practice
of
law,
is
vital
to
the
survival
of
our
system.
now,
is
this
practice
of
law
a
profession
or
is
it
a
business?
i
submit
if
your
honors
please,
that
the
bar
of
virginia
looks
confident
and
to
this
court
at
the
pinnacle
of
that
system
to
assist
it
in
maintaining
for
it
a
high
standards
of
a
profession.
thank
you.
mr.
aubrey
r.
bowles,
jr.
no
sir
and
i
think
also
an
answer
to
that
question,
that
if
the
union
would
be
contempt
to
do
that,
they
would
render
a
great
service
both
to
the
bar
and
to
the
public.
