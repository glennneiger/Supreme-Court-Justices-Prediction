justice

but,
no
longer
any
payments
by
lawyers
to
the
brotherhood?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
brief
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
exactly
what
we're
talking
about
here?
you
--
the
--
the
decree
does
enjoin
the
brotherhood
from
recommending
only
one
lawyer.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
so
but
the
--
the
decree
does
enjoin
the
brotherhood
from
recommending,
say
there's
a
100
cases
and
it
recommends
only
one
lawyer
in
each
case.
now,
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
decree
does
present
---
justice
byron
r.
white
--
precisely
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
brotherhood
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
infer
that
when
it
recommends
only
one
lawyer,
just
as
we
prefer
this
lawyer
and
we
recommended
seriously
that
you
go
to
this
lawyer.
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
approves
--
approved
lawyers.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
say
that
the
--
would
you
say
that
the
brotherhood
is
or
is
not
entitled
to
send
--
its
representatives
call
on
an
injured
person?
would
you
say
that
he
is
--
he
may
or
may
not
say,
"we
recommended
it
to
hire
lawyer,
and
the
injured
person
as,
"whom
should
i
go
to?"
and
the
brotherhood
answers
one
name.
one
name,
now
this
is
what
happens
all
the
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
--
is
this
--
as
you
call
it
"soliciting
and
advocating"
which
apparently
i
think
is
different
from
recommending
presumably.
why
isn't
this
activity
talking
about
it
alone
squarely
covered
by
button?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
told
you
to
do
that
you
could
prevent
then
an
individual
employee
--
an
individual
person
from
recommending
a
lawyer
to
a
friend
of
you.
his
speech
would
not
be
subject
to
person
under
protection
i
suppose
on
your
--
on
your
theory.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
naughton,
do
any
of
the
decrees
outstanding
against
the
brotherhood
prohibit
either
expressly
or
impliedly
the
brotherhood
from
hiring
and
paying
a
lawyer
--
putting
a
lawyer
on
its
staff
to
handle
the
cases
of
its
members
in
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
the
other
decrees?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
brotherhood
has
never
attempted
to
do
it.
actually
they
have
a
--
have
lawyers
on
its
own
staff
which
handles
cases
for
its
members.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
brotherhood
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
brotherhood
is
still
advising
members
when
they
go
to
call
him
and
that
they
have
a
claim,
well
i
think
they
have.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
it's
different
whether
if
it's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
constitution
of
the
brotherhood
provides
that
this
activity
is
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
activities
of
the
brotherhood?
it
is
one
of
the
things
people
pay
dues
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
authorized
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
the
extent
the
legal
aid
bureau
has
expenses
which
i
gathered
it
does,
it
now
and
it
must
finance
it
solely
out
of
the
union
due?

byron
