justice
potter
stewart
you
went
a
little
fast
for
me.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
one
reason
i
was
having
trouble
finding
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
decree,
and
i
don't
have
it
on
page
4
and
5
of
the
petitioner
for
the
writ
of
certiorari.
can
you
summarize
again
in
a
word
or
two
what
it
is
specifically
that
you
object
to?
in
other
words,
demand
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
this
question.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
c?
justice
potter
stewart
in
answer
to
justice
harlan's
question
i
gathered
from
your
summary
of
what
those
witnesses
said
that
the
brotherhood
at
least
takes
that
much
initiative.
they
tell
the
injured
man
that
he
can
get
--
he
can
get
one
of
the
lawyers
you
recommend
or
a
lawyer
of
his
own
choice
and
don't
they
all
further
advice
him
not
to
settle
without
a
lawyer?
justice
potter
stewart
but
did
you
emphasize
that
throughout
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
but
what
--
what
if
--
what
if
john
smith
is
injured
on
the
railroad
and
he's
an
employee
and
one
of
your
members,
and
he
sits
and
does
nothing.
he's
in
--
he's
lying
there
in
his
hospital
bed.
what
if
anything
that
the
brotherhood
do?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
so
thank
you
very
much.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that
but
i
just
want
to
point
what
--
factually,
what
you
do.
you
send
a
--
do
you
send
an
agent
there
to
see
him
in
the
hospital
room?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
fine.
but
what
--
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
they
say,
“brother,
i
think
you
ought
to.”
justice
potter
stewart
now,
who
is
it
who
goes
to
visit
john
in
the
hospital?
justice
potter
stewart
but
as
mr.
justice
brennan
has
suggested
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
virginia
there's
just
--
there's
one
lawyer
in
that
region
isn't
there?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
but
the
recommendation
is
not
of
16
lawyers.
there
--
there
are
only
16
in
the
whole
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
he
can
recommend
and
suggest.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
justice
potter
stewart
“specific
lawyers”
--
“a
specific
lawyer
in
any
case”
isn't
it
or
am
i
mistaken?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
a
choice
of
two
or
more
but
--
but
rather
a
recommendation
of
one
lawyer
or
one
firm
in
any
given
case
or
am
i
wrong?
justice
potter
stewart
he
would
be
one
of
these
16,
probably?
justice
potter
stewart
the
next
closest
to
the
region,
perhaps
geographically.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
by
your
--
your
brotherhood?
by
members
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
your
brotherhood?
and
there
are
many
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
other
brotherhoods?
justice
potter
stewart
filed
in
the
country,
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
fela
paid
cases
generally
are
filed
every
year?
do
you
have
any
idea?
justice
potter
stewart
without
the
counsel.
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
500
though
and
there
--
justice
potter
stewart
say
more
or
less
by
your
--
by
your
members
and
their
--
justice
potter
stewart
a
few
thousand,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that
could
be
both
cause
and
effect,
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
it
were
the
same
--
if
there
were
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
same
man
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
(voice
overlap)
state
area
over
a
period
of
15
years.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
there
were
only
16
people
in
the
whole
nation,
who
were
recommended
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
because
you
are
--
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
does
it
reached
this
far?
forget
for
a
moment
the
brotherhood
or
labor
union.
if
you
argue
that
because
of
the
protection
for
the
first
amendment,
a
state
could
not
constitutionally
forbid
lawyer
generally
from
advertising
services
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
billboards
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
deeply
involved
it
seems
to
me
(voice
overlap)
view
of
the
--
the
highest
court
of
virginia.
justice
potter
stewart
this
whole
thing
is
about
the
lawyers,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
but
in
this
case,
i
was
just
exploring
the
grant
of
your
constitutional
argument
and
what
--
i
didn't
quite
understand
your
answer.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
a
state
could
constitutionally
forbid
a
--
a
lawyer
generally
from
advertising
their
services?
