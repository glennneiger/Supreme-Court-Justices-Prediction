justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
stallard.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
help
me
a
great
deal
if
you
could
tell
me
looking
at
the
judgment
--
the
final
decree
here,
i
have
it
at
page
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
25
i
think
of
the
petition
for
writ.
it
may
be
another
page.
which
of
those
provisions
a
to
h
are
you
here
complaining
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
--
you
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
could
live
that
that
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
e?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
stallard.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
get
back
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question,
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
in
each
local,
perhaps
that's
not
the
proper
description
for
the
brotherhood
if
you
know
what
i
mean
that
there
is
someone
who
--
if
there
is
an
accident
involving
a
member
of
the
union
has
a
duty
to
go
see
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that's
--
as
part
of
that
then
is
in
his
duty
to
go
see
the
injured
member?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
see
him.
alright.
now,
when
he
goes
to
see
him,
i
gather
what
you've
answered
to
justice
harlan
that
what
he
ordinarily
tells
him
is,
"you
better
get
yourself
a
lawyer."
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
service
that
the
legal
aid
department
renders
that
legal
advice
may
be
given
by
a
lawyer
other
than
one
retained
by
the
member?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no
i
--
what
i'm
--
what
i'm
asking
is,
is
there
a
lawyer
on
the
staff
of
the
legal
aid
department
who
gives
free
advice
as
to
whether
or
not
he
has
a
claim?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
now,
then
i
understand
you
today
at
least
all
that
the
secretary
in
alignment
does
is
to
say
to
him,
“now
that
you
suffered
this
accident,
you
consult
a
lawyer.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then,
if
--
does
the
secretary
then
say,
“if
you
need
a
lawyer,
here's
a
good
name?”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
they
do.
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
who
are
the
lawyers
they
recommend?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wouldn't
it
ordinarily
be
one
of
the
16
of
these
regional
counsels?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
would
it
be
the
regional
counsel
for
this
which
include
the
state
in
which
the
fellow
was
hospitalized
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
the
--
i
think
common
sense
would
indicate
it
would
be.
why
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
fellow
from
new
york
go
to
california.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
saying
that
in
fact,
what
the
injured
member
is
given
is
a
list
of
all
16
regional
counsels?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
you
couldn't
live
with
provisions
c,
d,
and
h
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understood
the
decree.
now,
what
you
told
us
of
the
procedure
puzzles
me
because
c
is
from
holding
out
lawyers
selected
by
it
as
the
only
approved
lawyers
to
aid
the
members
of
the
family.
you
tell
us
that
you
do
--
don't
do
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
from
informing
any
lawyer
that
an
accident
has
occurred
and
furnishing
the
name
and
address
of
an
injured
or
deceased
member
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
legal
employment
for
such
lawyer
or
in
any
other
manner
soliciting
or
encouraging
such
legal
employment
of
the
selected
lawyers.
you
haven't
said
anything
to
us
about
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
procedure
involved
informing
any
lawyer
that
an
accident
had
occurred
and
furnishing
name
and
address
of
the
injured
or
deceased
members.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
this
is
a
--
this
enjoins
you
from
informing
any
lawyer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
accident
has
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
occurred
and
giving
the
name
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
name
and
address
of
the
victim.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
naughton,
those
actually
are
the
implication.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
may
be
25,000
injuries
or
deaths
or
whatever
it
may
be
--
but
only
about
500
ever
gets
to
litigation
because
the
rest
i
gather
settled
along
the
way
or
just
nothing's
done
about
it.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
time
lost
alone,
meaning
on
the
wages
lost?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
other
aspects
of
the
damage
claim
from
the
injury,
you
don't
assert
any
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
say
the
record
now
is
that
the
lawyer
charges
what
he
wants
and
keeps
it
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
mind
--
would
you
mind
just
detailing
for
me,
if
you
can,
briefly
what
is
the
conduct
that
you
say
is
constitutionally
protected
which
this
decree
enjoined?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
does
that
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.

where
is
that
found?
