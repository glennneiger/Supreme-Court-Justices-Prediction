mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
good
morning
your
honors
and
with
permission
of
the
court
as
your
honors
know,
i
am
here
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
plaintiffs
to
ask
your
honors
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
held
in
effect
that
these
actions
maybe
tried
in
philadelphia
where
they
were
commenced.
the
precise
question
of
law
to
be
decided
in
this
case
as
i
see
it
is
whether
or
not
a
district
court
judge
has
the
power
as
a
matter
of
law
to
transfer
an
action
to
another
district
court
in
which
it
could
not
have
been
commenced
because
of
lack
of
capacity
of
the
plaintiffs.
we
advance
to
your
honors
three
reasons
why
this
question
should
be
answered
in
the
negative
and
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
they
are
these
-
first,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
accordance
with
the
express
intent
of
congress
as
construed
by
prior
decisions
of
this
and
other
courts.
secondly,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
in
accordance
with
the
policy
of
the
states
and
the
federal
government
as
embodied
in
the
rules
of
civil
--
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
and
thirdly,
that
decision
should
be
affirmed
because
to
reverse
it
would
be
to
work
grave
prejudice
to
the
substantive
rights
of
these
plaintiffs.
now,
if
your
honors
will
permit
me
before
referring
to
those
arguments
in
detail,
i
would
like
to
make
a
brief
reference
to
the
facts.
in
all
of
these
cases,
we
have
as
plaintiffs,
fiduciaries
who
lived
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania.
each
one
of
them
was
appointed
fiduciary
by
an
orphans
court
in
pennsylvania.
each
one
of
them
represents
a
decedent
who
also
lived
in
pennsylvania
and
whose
estate
will
be
administered
under
the
laws
of
pennsylvania.
each
one
of
those
decedents
was
a
resident
of
pennsylvania
and
started
on
this
journey
from
pennsylvania.
now,
if
i
may
allude
for
one
moment
to
--
a
particular
one
of
these
cases,
the
case
of
mrs.
frankenfield.
she
is
typical.
she
happened
to
be
a
client
of
mine.
she
came
to
me
under
these
circumstances
and
asked
me
to
take
her
case.
i
agreed
to
do
so.
i
recommended
that
suit
be
commenced
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
because
i
learned
that
each
of
the
defendants
involved
--
each
of
the
defendants
involved
that
i
thought
she
had
an
action
against
did
business
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania.
she
agreed.
that
was
done.
now,
at
this
point
in
a
small
parenthesis,
i
would
like
to
submit
to
your
honors,
i
do
not
think
it's
fair
to
describe
that
conduct
as
forum-shopping.
that
was
a
natural
and
normal
thing
for
a
--
a
pennsylvania
fiduciary
to
do
with
respect
to
suits
against
the
corporate
defendants
doing
business
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
because
of
diversity
of
citizenship.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
we
choose
the
federal
court
to
answer
your
honor
specifically
because
the
federal
court
in
philadelphia
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
maybe,
i
guess.
if
you
want
to
call
that
forum-shopping,
it's
fair
to
say
that,
but
we
have
as
your
honor
very
well
knows,
there
are
many
other
excellent
reasons
for
bringing
suit
in
the
federal
courts
where
there's
diversity
of
citizenship.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
yes,
sir.
and
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
condition
of
the
docket
which
in
the
federal
courts
in
philadelphia
is
a
year
shorter
than
in
the
court
of
common
pleas.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
yes,
sir.
four
years
and
--
and
in
addition
to
that,
there
are
other
reasons.
the
--
all
the
cases
in
--
in
the
district
court
of
--
of
philadelphia
are
consolidated
whereas
we
have
separate
courts
of
common
pleas
in
philadelphia
which
leads
to
many
complications.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
that
thought
never
occurred
to
me
at
that
time
and
i
don't
think
that
would've
occurred
to
any
--
not
to
any
of
the
plaintiffs
at
that
time.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
because
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
i
agree
with
your
honor
but
if
we
passed
that
point,
then
my
opponent
say
that
forum-shopping
is
a
thing
which
this
court
should
--
should
account
on
the
negative
side
in
deciding
this
case.
now,
i
don't
think
it
should
but
in
any
event,
this
wasn't
forum-shopping
it
seems
to
me.
in
the
same
parenthesis,
i'd
like
to
say
this.
i
do
not
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
when
we
took
this
action,
we
failed
to
qualify
as
ancillary
fiduciaries
in
massachusetts.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
word
failure
implies
a
duty.
i
didn't
notify
the
prime
minister
of
australia
that
i
was
going
to
make
this
argument
this
morning
and
i
don't
i
think
i
failed
to.
i
could
be
said
to
have
failed
to
notify
him
because
i
had
no
duty
to
notify
him.
and
in
this
case,
i
stress
this
point
because
50%
of
a
government's
brief
is
built
around
the
word
"we
failed
to
qualify"
as
ancillary
administrators
in
philadelphia.
we
have
--
in
massachusetts,
we
had
no
duty
to
do
so
and
therefore,
i
think
any
consideration
or
failure
in
that
regard
ought
to
dropout
of
any
consideration
of
this
case.
now,
having
commenced
these
suits,
the
defendants
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
that
motion
was
considered
by
the
--
judge
van
dusen,
the
district
court
judge
and
the
motion
was
granted.
we
applied
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
a
writ
of
mandamus
because
the
judge
had
not
certified
this
was
a
--
and
a
--
eligible
for
interlocutory
appeal
and
we
could
find
nothing
under
the
rules
which
suggested
it
would
be
proper
to
make
a
motion
that
he
so
certified.
your
honor
knows
that
the
interlocutory
--
if
your
honors
know
that
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
provides
that
it
cannot
be
used
unless
the
district
court
judge
certifies
that
it
is
an
appealable
question
under
the
interlocutory
appeals
act.
he
didn't
do
that.
there
is
no
precision
--
procedure
whereby
we
could
ask
him
to
do
that
so
that's
why
we
chose
a
writ
of
mandamus.
and
thus
the
question
became
in
the
court
of
appeals,
did
the
court
exceed
his
power
in
transferring
these
cases
to
a
district
in
which
they
might
not
have
been
brought.
therefore,
the
--
we
get
the
first
legal
question
and
your
honors
have
to
consider.
might
these
cases
had
been
brought
in
the
district
court
of
massachusetts,
what's
the
test?
if
these
plaintiffs
had
brought
these
actions
in
the
district
court
of
massachusetts
and
the
defendant
had
moved
to
dismiss
under
the
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
17
(b),
the
court
must
--
was
required
to
dismiss
them
for
this
reason.
rule
17
(b)
as
these
defendants
would
have
argued
in
massachusetts
says
that
the
capacity
to
sue
shall
--
i'm
just
quoting
only
that
much
of
it
as
it
applies
to
our
case,
capacity
to
sue
shall
be
determined
by
the
law
of
the
court
of
the
state
in
which
the
court
sits."
therefore,
the
massachusetts
district
court
judge
would
have
looked
to
the
law
of
massachusetts
under
that
rule
to
determine
whether
or
not
we
had
capacity
to
sue.
we
had
not
qualified,
it
never
--
there
was
no
reason
for
us
to
qualify
as
ancillary
administrators
up
there
and
the
law
of
massachusetts
is
very
clear
that
a
foreign
fiduciary
may
not
bring
an
action
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
and
if
he
does
his
action
without
a
qualification
up
there,
if
he
does,
his
action
should
be
dismissed.
so
there
is
no
doubt
about
what
these
cases
could
not
have
been
brought
in
massachusetts
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
so
found.
our
opponents,
the
government
concedes
that
they
would
have
had
that
defense
in
massachusetts,
but
they
--
but
all
of
the
defendants
attempt
to
circumvent
that
conclusion
by
saying,
"well,
if
we
had
tried,
we
could've
qualified
up
there."
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
your
honors
please,
qualification
of
an
ancillary
administrator
in
massachusetts
requires
much
more
than
a
ministerial
act.
it
requires
application
to
the
probate
court
in
massachusetts
which
will
--
after
due
notice
of
30
or
15
days,
depending
upon
whether
it's
a
--
a
--
an
executor
or
an
administrator
which
is
applying,
it
requires
application
to
the
court
which
will
consider
the
appointment
of
the
ancillary
administrator
and
will
normally
follow
a
certain
list
of
priorities
which
are
--
in
--
in
making
these
appointments
which
are
rather
strictly
followed.
the
list
of
priorities
in
massachusetts
is,
first,
the
widow
or
the
husband;
secondly,
next
of
kin,
thirdly,
creditors,
fourth,
the
public
administrator.
some
of
our
plaintiffs
do
not
come
within
any
of
those
categories.
in
any
event,
cases
cited
in
our
brief
show
you
that
the
massachusetts
court
in
this
situation
does
not
always
appoint
those
who
are
otherwise
ostensibly
qualified,
but
appointment
--
ancillary
appointment
in
massachusetts
is
a
matter
addressed
of
the
discretion
of
the
court.
so
i
say
to
your
honors
and
our
brief
will
elaborate
this,
there
is
very
grave
doubt
whether
or
not
--
even
if
we
had
applied,
we
would've
qualified
in
these
cases.
in
addition
to
that
fact
your
honor,
we
had
no
--
we
never
--
there
was
no
reason
for
us
to
try,
if
your
honor
please.
and
if
one
more
went
--
before
i
get
to
that
one.
in
--
in
addition
to
the
facts
that
i've
just
indicated,
these
suits
which
weâ€™re
now
considering
were
commenced
with
--
some
of
them
were
commenced
with
only
a
few
weeks
of
the
expiration
of
the
1-year-statute
limitations.
one
of
them
was
commenced
on
the
very
last
day
that
suit
could've
been
commenced.
now,
in
massachusetts,
we
are
required
by
law
to
advertise
our
application
for
letters
of
--
ancillary
letters
up
there
for
either
15
or
30
days.
so
that
there
wasn't
time
to
do
the
things
required
up
there
before
the
statue
of
limitations
expired.
but
in
any
event,
your
honors
have
told
us
clearly
in
the
case
of
hoffman
versus
blaski
that
the
test
as
to
whether
or
not
a
--
an
action
could've
been
brought
in
the
transferee
district
is
not
to
be
applied
as
of
the
time
of
transfer
--
the
application
for
transfer,
but
rather
the
test
is
to
be
applied
as
of
the
time
the
suit
is
commenced.
that
was
the
square
holding
in
hoffman
versus
blaski
as
your
honors
will
recall
and
this
is
detailed
in
my
brief.
so
the
only
proper
test
in
this
case
is,
were
these
plaintiffs
qualified
to
bring
this
action
in
massachusetts
as
of
the
day
they
commenced
them
in
pennsylvania
and
there
is
no
room
for
argument,
they
were
not.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
would
i
--
in
other
words
--
first
of
all,
what
conflicts
law
would
be
applied.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
pennsylvania
can't
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
yes.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
we
could
not
have
brought
this
suit
anywhere
at
--
in
pennsylvania
or
massachusetts
after
the
expiration
of
one
year,
we
could
not
have.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
because
massachusetts's
statute
of
limitations
is
one
year
and
so
is
pennsylvania's
incidentally.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
as
your
honor
knows
this,
the
conflicts
of
law
question
in
this
situation
is
in
the
state
of
flux
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
--
but
to
answer
you
directly,
i
think
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
i
think
we
could
not.
i
think
it
does
mean
that.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
oh,
we
could've
started
the
suit
certainly
but
it
could've
been
--
it
was
subject
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
--
to
the
defense
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
oh,
i
didn't
understand
the
thrust
of
your
question.
i
agree.
the
statute
of
limitations
did
not
prevent
us
bringing
the
suit.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
they
have
done
that.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
i
don't
think
they
have
a
right
to
do
that.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
i
don't
think
they
have
a
right
to
do
that.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
that's
correct.
no,
they
say
they
couldn't
do
that.
i
don't
think
they
ought
to
be
permitted
to
do
that
because
i
don't
think
this
what
--
where
it
might
have
been
brought,
permits
any
qualification
by
the
district
court
judge.
and
in
addition
to
that,
i
doubt
very
much
whether
--
well,
i
guess
if
they
require
a
stipulation
on
this
file
of
record,
it
would
bind.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
but
i
don't
think
that
under
our
present
law,
the
district
court
of
the
transferee
jurisdiction
cannot
decide
the
law
and
then
believe
that
the
transferee
district
court
is
bound
by
that
decision.
there
is
no
--
that
may
well
--
perhaps
that
should
be
the
law
but
until
this
court
says
so,
that's
not
the
law
now.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
yes,
although
the
massachusetts
law
--
the
massachusetts
law
now,
a
recent
amendment
permits
the
defendants
to
raise
it
at
any
time
including
the
trial
and
if
they
raise
it
at
trial
and
we're
not
qualified,
we're
done.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
not
--
you
have
to
advertise
for
30
or
14
days
before
you
can
begin
to
qualify
and
if
they
raise
it
at
trial,
it's
too
late.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
chief
justice
(inaudible)
supreme
court
of
massachusetts
says
that
the
law
isn't
settled
in
this
commonwealth
and
that
the
administrator
appointed
in
another
jurisdiction
is
not
thereby
qualified
to
maintain
an
action
under
our
death
statute.
now
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
yes
sir.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
that
question
was
not
involved
in
this
case.
all
of
these
cases
were
commenced
within
the
statutory
period.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
that's
right
sir
and
i'll
be
frank
to
say,
i
could
--
an
analysis
of
the
law
relating
to
the
problem,
the
conflicts
of
law
problem
in
these
transfer
cases
involving
the
statute
of
limitations
would
take
longer
than
it
would
take
to
argue
this
case.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
and
that
--
and
there's
a
problem
there
but
we
don't
have
that
problem
in
this
case.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
now,
i
have
indicated
that
the
--
up
to
this
point
of
--
it
discussed
what
the
statute
says
and
the
test
by
which
that
statute
is
to
be
applied.
now,
let
me
consider
the
--
the
construction
of
that
statute
as
construed
by
other
courts.
in
the
first
place
up
to
this
point,
i've
pointed
out
that
hoffman
versus
blaski
requires
the
applications
that
were
vindicated
up
to
now.
has
this
exact
problem
ever
been
considered
before,
not
by
this
court?
this
court
has
never
considered
exactly
the
set
of
circumstances
involved
on
this
case,
but
it
has
--
the
same
set
of
circumstances
namely,
a
fiduciary
with
the
problem
of
capacity
to
sue
has
been
considered
in
other
situations.
in
the
case
of
felchlin
versus
american
smelting
for
example
cited
in
our
brief,
exactly
this
situation
was
considered
and
the
court
held
that
it
could
not
be
transferred
because
the
plaintiffs
lacked
capacity
to
sue.
i
know
very
well
that
those
decisions
in
no
way
bind
this
court
and
yet
i
think
it's
significant
that
other
judicial
minds
having
considered
this
problem
have
reached
the
same
conclusion.
and
no
other
court
having
considered
this
problem
has
reached
the
opposite
conclusion
and
so
i
feel
confident
in
saying
that
the
--
the
--
this
construction
for
which
--
which
was
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
is
correct.
i
also
have
said
to
your
honors
that
the
second
reason
why
this
--
the
judgment
ought
to
be
affirmed
is
because
it
is
in
importance
with
the
policy
of
the
federal
government
and
the
law
of
the
state
as
exempt
--
as
embodied
in
rule
17.
there
are
very
good
reasons
why
the
states
provide
that
foreign
fiduciaries
should
qualify
before
they
bring
a
suit.
for
one
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
no
sir,
on
my
position
and
--
i
would
say
it
sir
is
that
the
federal
statute
1404
(a)
and
rule
17
(b)
control
the
situation
and
by
rule
17
(b)
which
says
that
capacity
shall
be
determined
by
the
law
of
the
state
in
which
the
court
sits.
by
that
rule,
this
court
has
said,
our
test
will
be
the
law
of
the
state.
and
there
are
very
good
reasons
for
such
a
rule
and
such
a
policy,
where
the
states
have
said,
certain
plaintiffs
may
not
sue,
the
united
states
would
not
want
to
circumvent
the
policies
of
those
cases
by
saying,
"well
in
our
case,
in
our
courts,
you
can
sue
anyway."
it
is
an
honest
matter
of
fact
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
if
we
have
started
these
suits
in
massachusetts,
they
would've
been
dismissed
beyond
any
question.
why
therefore
should
we
have
--
would
regard
them
as
actions
which
could've
brought
up
there
now,
when
we
bring
them
in
another
district?
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
yes
sir.
but
in
hoffman
versus
blaski,
you
said
it
didn't
make
any
difference
at
all
whether
the
defendants
would
be
willing
to
waive
their
defense.
this
court
said
that
in
hoffman
versus
blaski
that
the
test
was
whether
or
not
the
plaintiffs
had
the
right
to
bring
the
action
without
--
yes,
that
was
(inaudible),
yes
sir,
(inaudible).
now,
if
your
honor
please,
i
come
to
the
third
and
the
point
which
--
which
are
upon
--
which
our
opponents
have
relied
the
most.
they
say
to
your
honors,
consider
the
consequences
of
a
decision
in
accordance
with
the
--
with
precedent
in
this
situation.
they
say,
consider
the
consequences
this
would
have
on
the
administration
of
the
federal
courts
because
it
would
mean
that
fiduciary
cases
could
not
be
transferred
under
1404
(a).
i
think
if
we're
going
to
look
at
the
considerations
that
they
suggest,
the
practical
results
which
will
follow
from
an
affirmance
of
this
decision,
we
have
to
look
at
them
all.
and
i
think
the
first
consequence
we
ought
to
look
to
is
the
consequence
to
the
plaintiffs.
this
is
not
--
this
is
not
a
--
a
multiple
litigation
as
far
as
mrs.
frankenfield
is
concerned.
she
has
one
case
and
to
her,
this
is
a
single
case.
as
a
fiduciary,
it's
far
easier
and
far
cheaper
for
her
to
bring
the
suit
in
the
district
where
the
defendants
did
business
with
her
rather
than
to
go
up
some
place
up
to
massachusetts.
and
in
that
connection
your
honors
may
recall,
this
is
one
of
the
shortest
plane
distance
you
could
get.
if
we're
considering
rules
for
plane
cases,
remember
philadelphia
to
boston
if
you
don't
think
it's
very
far,
it
is
not
the
normal
--
is
not
the
average
i
mean
to
say,
plane
trip.
so
that
this
is
the
minimum
if
you're
considering
inconvenience
to
the
plaintiffs,
but
that
these
plaintiffs
are
not
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
it
will
be
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
yes,
it
will
be
a
great
inconvenience
to
mrs.
frankenfield
to
have
to
conduct
her
case
up
in
boston,
but
that
is
a
short
plane
trip.
in
the
average
plane
crash
case,
the
fiduciary
will
have
to
go
much
further
than
from
philadelphia
to
boston.
and
if
your
honors
are
considering
the
rule
by
this
test,
you
ought
to
bear
in
mind
that
these
cases
may
involve
fiduciaries
going
from
san
francisco
to
philadelphia
for
example.
in
other
words,
this
is
a
minimum
case
on
that
aspect.
now,
if
we're
going
to
consider
the
consequences
of
the
decision
here,
let's
consider
it's
affect
on
the
witnesses.
the
trial
judge
did
an
odd
thing
in
this
respect.
he
counted
up
the
number
of
witnesses
which
the
defendants
could
call,
not
would
call,
which
they
could
call,
who
lived
in
the
vicinity
of
boston
and
he
found
there
were
66.
and
he
counted
up
the
number
of
witnesses
who'd
--
eye
witnesses
who
didn't
live
in
the
vicinity
of
boston
and
found
there
were
17.
and
he
said,
"that
shows
that
it's
more
convenient
for
the
witnesses
that
this
case
be
tried
in
boston."
he
overlooked
the
fact
that
there
were
--
in
our
--
i
represent
28
different
estates
and
there's
seven
admiralty
case
--
23
different
estates
and
there's
seven
admiralty
cases.
in
our
cases,
there
are
30
plaintiffs
who
will
be
witnesses
and
if
we
allow
them
only
one
other
witness
on
damages,
that
makes
60
plus
the
17,
would
make
77
witnesses
will
have
to
go
up
to
boston
as
against
--
at
the
very
most
and
it
wouldn't
be
that
much,
66
coming
down
to
philadelphia.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
damages,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
that's
right
and
the
--
opportunity
for
advancement
and
so
forth.
now,
that
is
leaving
out
of
any
account
expert
witness
whom
you
might
call
and
other
fact
witnesses.
well,
who
would
tip
the
balance
still
further?
and
if
your
honor
please,
it
was
suggested
to
you
by
my
opponents
that
all
of
these
--
that
the
issue
in
this
case
is
going
to
be
the
birds
into
the
engine.
that
maybe
the
issue
but
we
really
don't
know
the
other
issues
that
will
be
involved
in
the
case
because
we
have
not
been
permitted
to
pursue
discovery
in
this
case
through
all
these
years.
the
circuit
court
or
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
court
has
ruled
that
we
may
not
pursue
discovery
while
this
preliminary
litigation
is
in
progress.
so
we
don't
really
know
what
the
issues
are
going
to
be
and
therefore,
we
don't
know
where
the
witnesses
are
going
to
come
from.
now,
let
me
get
now
down
to
the
real
heart
of
the
case
and
the
one
which
was
discussed
to
the
greatest
length
yesterday.
a
part
from
this
inconvenience
to
witnesses
and
to
the
party's
plaintiff,
what
about
the
grave
impairment
of
the
de
--
of
the
plaintiffs'
substantive
rights?
here's
the
situation
on
that
aspect
of
the
case
as
i
see
it.
as
your
honors
know,
under
klaxon
versus
stentor,
a
district
court
must
apply
the
conflicts
rule
of
the
state
in
which
it
sits.
now,
in
massachusetts
as
you
know,
there's
a
limitation
of
damages
in
this
action
of
$20,000.
in
pennsylvania
there
is
no
such
limitation
and
there
is
very
strong
constitutional
--
there
is
very
strong
pennsylvania
policy
embodied
in
two
places
in
its
constitution
indicating
that
pennsylvania
would
not
enforce
a
limitation
of
that
kind
within
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
judge
van
dusen
has
indicated
correctly
that
this
question
has
not
recently
been
decided
in
pennsylvania.
there
are
old
cases
in
which
the
court
has
refused
to
enforce
penalties.
your
honors
know
that
the
conflicts
law
on
this
point
is
in
the
state
of
flux.
the
old
rule
was
that
the
damaged
law
of
the
site
of
the
injury
would
be
the
law
applied.
but
under
the
redraft
of
the
restatement
which
has
not
yet
been
adopted
and
in
fact,
maybe
isn't
even
published
yet.
and
under
the
kilberg
case
and
the
pearson
case,
it
is
evident
that
the
law
is
changing
so
that
someday
in
the
not
too
distant
future,
the
conflicts
of
law
rule
is
going
to
be
the
law
of
damages
will
apply
which
is
the
law
of
the
state
having
the
most
contacts
with
the
event.
pennsylvania
has
not
recently
passed
on
that
point
but
because
of
its
constitutional
policy,
i
believe
that
the
best
probabilities
are
that
pennsylvania
would
adopt
the
so-called
pearson
conflicts
rule.
that
means
then
that
a
district
court
sitting
in
pennsylvania
under
klaxon
versus
stentor
obliged
to
follow
the
conflicts
of
law
rule
of
pennsylvania,
would
have
to
consider
what
pennsylvania
supreme
court
would
decide
on
this
question.
if
we
send
this
case
up
to
massachusetts,
the
massachusetts
court
will
do
what?
which
conflicts
of
law
rule
will
he
apply?
under
klaxon
versus
stentor,
this
point
is
not
decided
and
as
your
honors
know
better
than
i,
there
are
cases
each
way
on
this
point.
they're
cited
in
our
brief.
some
cases
say
that
transferee
court
should
apply
the
conflicts
of
law
rule
of
the
state
of
the
transferor.
other
cases
say
that
the
transferee
court
should
apply
the
conflicts
of
law
rule
of
the
state
in
which
it
sits.
this
is
uncertain
therefore,
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
yes.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
yes
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
yes.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
yes.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
right.
now,
if
you
don't
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
yes.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
alright
now,
unless
you
do
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
yes,
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
that.
first,
note
that
if
you
don't
settle
that
there
is
grave
hazard
in
our
going
to
massachusetts
and
it's
not
settled
unless
you
settle
it
in
this
case.
now,
if
we
do
go
to
massachusetts,
i
mean
if
it
is
settled,
we
do
go
to
massachusetts
and
this
court
directs
the
massachusetts
court
in
the
sense
to
follow
the
federal
rule
and
apply
the
conflicts
of
law
rule
of
the
transferor
state,
then
the
district
court
judge
would
decide
what
to
do,
would
decide
that
it
was
pennsylvania
law
that
applied
therefore
that
in
our
cases
the
limitation
would
not
apply
and
then
what
would
he
do?
would
he
submit
our
cases
to
the
same
jury
that
would
decide
the
--
the
massachusetts
residence
cases
and
tell
them
that
for
your
neighbors,
you
find
the
limitation
of
$20,000
and
for
us,
for
the
pennsylvania
strangers,
there
is
no
limitation?
do
you
not
believe
your
honor
that
our
case
would
be
at
jeopardy
and
hazard
under
that
situation?
now
you
may
say
to
me,
"he
can
solve
that
problem
by
saying,
we
won't
try
these
cases
before
the
same
jury,
we'll
try
them
before
separate
juries."
and
i
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
yes
and
i
say
to
your
honor,
if
that's
the
case,
why
go
up
to
massachusetts?
if
we're
not
consolidating
these
cases
to
save
time,
why
go
up
there?
that's
why
you
--
that's
why
the
government
ostensibly
puts
us
to
all
these
trouble
and
expense
for
the
sake
of
consolidation
for
trial.
it's
the
only
possible
theory.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
but
convenience
can
only
occur
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
convenience
can
only
occur
and
if
justice
is
involved
that
can
only
be
done
in
consolidation
for
trial.
if
the
idea
--
the
idea
they
seem
to
have
is
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
it
will
sure,
that's
where
the
witnesses
--
where
the
effect
--
it
shows
on
the
witnesses.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
it
--
when
they
want
to
consolidate,
they
want
to
consolidate
so
they
can
bring
the
witnesses
in
once.
you
see,
but
if
we're
going
to
have
to
have
two
trials
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
well
as
i've
said
to
your
honor,
there
are
more
witnesses
in
pennsylvania
than
there
are
in
massachusetts.
now,
that
--
remember
what
we
said,
first
of
all,
this
point
is
not
settled,
so
that
if
you
send
us
up
there
now
without
settling
that
point,
we
are
in
double
danger.
if
you
do
settle
that
point
and
incidentally
as
a
member
of
the
bar,
i
hope
you
will
because
this
--
the
better
rule
is
that
the
transferee
court
were
to
apply
the
conflicts
law
rule
of
the
transferor
state
and
the
bench
in
part
needs
to
be
in
enlightened
on
that
need
to
be
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
it
necessarily
follows
if
your
honor
please,
but
that's
another
reason
for
affirming
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
if
you
let
these
cases
be
tried
in
pennsylvania,
we
don't
have
to
go
through
this
extremely
complicated
business.
this
--
the
very
complication
is
to
the
prejudice
of
the
plaintiffs
in
these
cases.
there's
no
problem
as
far
as
we're
concerned
if
we
stay
in
pennsylvania.
now,
i
say
--
i
would
like
to
say
one
thing
at
the
end
and
then
stop.
if
your
honors
please,
i
hope
--
i
feel
that
my
duty
to
my
clients
to
say
this,
this
is
not
an
academic
question.
we
are
not
engaged
in
an
academic
exercise.
i
represent
28
different
plaintiffs
and
the
captions
and
complaints
show
that
at
least
17
of
these
plaintiffs
are
widows
who
lost
their
husbands
and
bread
winners
in
this
case
and
a
number
of
them
have
a
number
of
children
under
five
years
of
age
that
they're
going
to
have
to
raise.
when
i
say
to
your
honors
that
transfer
to
massachusetts
is
in
mitigation
of
their
substantive
rights,
that's
a
lot
nice
phrase.
it
floats
very
trippingly
from
the
tongue.
but
if
you
translate
that
into
anglo-saxon,
that
is
the
difference
between
$20,000
and
$200,000
to
a
widow
who
has
young
children
to
raise.
so
i
say,
if
you're
going
to
consider
extraneous
circumstances
such
as
the
convenience
of
the
government
or
the
courts,
let's
remember
that
the
convenience
of
the
courts
in
the
process
of
litigation
necessarily
is
secondary
to
the
rights
of
the
individuals
and
this
is
the
court
that
establishes
that.
and
therefore,
if
your
honor
please,
i
urge
you
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit
and
--
and
let
this
case
end
here
and
these
cases
be
tried
in
philadelphia.
thank
you.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
i
believe
that
the
--
it
is
correct
that
under
the
right
of
mandamus,
a
court
of
appeals
may
not
be
asked
to
review
and
exercise
of
discretion.
i
think
the
law
is
clear
on
that.
if
one
uses
the
writ,
an
application
to
writ
of
mandamus,
the
court
of
appeals
is
confined
to
considering
whether
or
not
the
district
court
judge
exceeded
his
power
as
a
matter
of
law.
i
think
that
explains
both
of
the
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
i
think
they
had
to
dismiss
the
application
for
writ
of
mandamus
where
they
were
asked
to
review
the
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
without
considering
it
because
under
writ
of
mandamus,
you
can't
consider
exercise
of
discretion.
you
can
only
consider
questions
of
law.
that's
why
when
he
got
to
our
application
for
writ
of
mandamus
they
did
consider
the
question
of
law.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
yes
sir.
i
think
under
klaxon
and
stentor,
the
exact
holding
was
that
the
forum
must
apply
the
conflicts
of
law
rule
of
the
state
in
which
it
sits.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
yes
sir,
that's
--
i
say,
there
are
questions
in
cases
involving
motions
to
transfer
under
1404
(a)
and
a
transfer
--
the
cases
are
divided
on
whether
or
not
the
--
i
don't
think
they
should
be
but
they
are
divided
on
whether
or
not
the
transferee
court
will
apply
the
law
of
the
state.
you
see,
when
the
transferee
court
sits
to
consider
this
case,
it
reads,
klaxon
versus
stentor.
klaxon
versus
stentor
says
a
court
must
follow
the
conflicts
of
law
rule
on
the
state
on
which
it
sits.
and
naturally,
the
district
court
judge
and
the
transferee
court
says,
i'm
sitting
in
massachusetts,
therefore,
under
klaxon
and
stentor,
i
have
to
consider
massachusetts
law.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
it's
an
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
well,
in
one
sense
the
pearson
case
establishes
that
that
is
so.
that
is
--
most
necessarily
be
so.
if
the
modern
conflict
of
rural
rule
is
followed
that
a
--
the
state
of
pen
--
that
the
state
will
not
apply
and
a
--
limitation
of
the
jurisdiction
in
which
the
accident
occurred
and
i
might
say
your
honor,
i
think
that's
entirely
proper
from
a
social
point
of
view.
there
are
only
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
under
that
thinking
if
your
honor
please,
should
it
make
any
difference
to
these
plaintiffs
that
they
brought
their
suit
in
a
district
court
in
pennsylvania,
when
if
they
had
brought
them
in
the
court
of
common
pleas,
they
would
not
have
been
subject
to
a
limitation?
why
should
they
be
subject
to
that
limitation
just
because
they
brought
their
case
in
the
district
court
in
philadelphia?
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
yes.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
well,
we
think
under
the
federal
view
that
law
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
well,
he
said
he
did.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
that's
it.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
and
that
has
not
yet
been
decided.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
and
as
you
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
yes,
it's
possible
but
in
all
fairness,
i
think
there's
no
doubt
that
the
reason
why
we're
here
is
because
our
--
the
possibilities
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
yes
sir.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
and
by
the
test
of
the
law
therefore,
to
send
this
to
massachusetts
would
be
in
litigation
of
our
rights
and
therefore
transfer
should
be
refused.
and
that's
why
i
say
this
is
not
an
academic
question
your
honor.
this
--
the
decision
in
this
case
will
be
keenly
felt
by
many
people
for
years
to
come
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
--
in
this
case.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
if
the
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
if
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
decides
that
pennsylvania
law
would
apply
and
if
that
is
a
final
judgment,
we
have
had
everything
we
asked
for.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
in
the
case
of
gulf
oil
corporation
versus
gilbert,
your
honors
pointed
out
the
considerations
which
should
be
given
weight
on
these
matters.
and
one
of
them
that
you
pointed
out
was
that
it's
better
for
the
local
judge
to
determine
local
law.
and
this
court
knows
that
it
always
prefers
to
have
law
decided
by
local
judges.
this
is
what
you
said
in
the
gulf
oil
case.
there
is
an
appropriateness
too
in
having
the
trial
of
a
diversity
case
in
the
form
that
is
at
home
with
the
state
law
must
govern
the
case,
that's
pennsylvania
in
this
situation
rather
than
having
the
court
in
some
other
forum,
massachusetts,
untangled
problems
in
conflict
of
laws.
that's
our
case,
our
position.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
because
we
think
--
to
answer
your
honor
precisely,
we
think
that
this
will
be
clearer
to
a
court
of
appeals
judges
for
the
third
--
third
circuit
for
example
that
pennsylvania
would
apply
its
own
law
in
this
situation
than
it
would
be
to
a
massachusetts
judge
who
has
been
trained
and
has
grown
up
and
lived
under
the
rule
that
--
of
the
older
conflicts
rule,
(inaudible),
and
the
limitation
there.
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
i
do
believe
that
those
decisions
would
be
--
mr.
john
r.
mcconnell
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
i'm
grateful
to
your
honors
for
the
attention
you've
given
me.
thank
you.
