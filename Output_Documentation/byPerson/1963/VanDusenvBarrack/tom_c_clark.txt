i
could
see
that
massachusetts
passing
(inaudible)
at
this
point
and
that
the
supreme
court
did
not
pass
upon
it
in
the
interim
which
is
unlikely
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.

do
you
know
of
any
cases
(voice

justice

(inaudible)
the
interim,
the
inconvenience
to
the
plaintiffs
to
that
extent.
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
they've
already
employed
attorneys,
had
they
not?
justice
tom

(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
how
about
the
â€“
(inaudible)
justice
tom

well
--
justice

(inaudible)
your
argument
was
that
to
get
more
(inaudible).
you
had
them
straight
out,
didn't
you?
even
two
(inaudible)
you
have
two
courts
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.

it
took
a
long
time
in
deciding

(inaudible)
justice

(inaudible)
to
the
liability
which
is

justice
tom
c.
clark
i
don't
mean
that,
i
think
of
--
by
the
implications
to
the

judge
having
had
to
experience
at
the
trial
on

on
liability.
there's

when
this

came
up

they're
disposed

so
it
appeared
to
me,
if
you
have
114
people
here
who
are
waiting,
four
years
(inaudible).
justice
tom
c.

because
five
people
trying

contest
your

where
it
could
be

that
would
be

justice
tom
c.

only
five
here,
aren't
they?
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
would
be
true
anyway
if
pennsylvania
law
is
different
from
massachusetts
law,
you'd
have
to
have
a
jury
determination
(inaudible).
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)

the
jury,
wouldn't
it?
(inaudible)
as

is
doing
and
get
$20,000
