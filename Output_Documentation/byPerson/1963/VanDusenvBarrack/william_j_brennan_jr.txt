considerate,
i
mean

he
thought
of
abstention
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
kilberg
--
whether
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

the
supreme
court
would
do
it
to
new
york
court
of
appeals
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
is
that
--
is
that
the
one
you've
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
but
why
did
--
why
would
the
massachusetts
law
have
to
consult
pennsylvania
law
or
conflict
rule
or
anything
else
about
pennsylvania
after
the
transfer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
it
wasn't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
didn't.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(voice

mr.
rhoads
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
prevail
and
we
reversed
the
court
of
appeals
and
reinstate
judge
van
dusen's
order
for
transfer.
what
would
be
the
substantive
law
in
the
district
court
of
massachusetts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
but
the
other
petitioners
were
--
are
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they're
involved
with
the
massachusetts
bonding
decision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what's
your
personal
view
mr.
hollander
whether
the
transfer
would
carry
them
when
it
comes
to
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
the
conflict
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
follow
that.
why
will
there
not
be
a
determination
against
some
of
the
merits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
is
on
the
premise
as
you
suggest
that
the
pennsylvania
conflicts
will
really
have
to
be
applied
by
the
massachusetts
court
if
the
transfer
goes
full?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
how
long
do
they
(inaudible)
this
conflict
problem
as
a
federal
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
a
--
lay
--
laying
aside
for
the
moment
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
although
i
think
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
the
nature
of
--
well
how
--
how
does
it
--
how
was
it
made
a
federal
question,
do
you
know?
perhaps
it
is,
i
can
--
i
can
see
the
argument
is
based
on
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
otherwise
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
my
question
doesn't
go
to
your
position,
the
united
states
position
but
the
position
of
the
others.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
some
are
actions
going
out
of
this
act
are
already
pending
in
massachusetts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
now,
would
the
purpose
of
this
transfer
be
to
consolidate
these
actions
in
a
single
action
with
all
of
those
pending
in
massachusetts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
well
what
puzzles
me
about
this
is,
if
--
if
the
choice
of
law,
if
pennsylvania's
choice
of
law
will
go
with
these
cases
to
massachusetts,
it
certainly
is
going
to
be
a
separate
problem
for
whatever
a
massachusetts
judge
tries
these
cases.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
problem,
he's
going
to
have
to
deal
with
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
the
cases
in
massachusetts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
--
why
not
if
--
if
the
pennsylvania
laws
and
the
uncertain
state
which
tell
us
it
is,
why
should
a
massachusetts
district
judge
have
to
wrestle
with
the
uncertain,
the
pennsylvania
law?
isn't
they
--
pennsylvania
district
judge
at
least
--
until
he
better
qualify
to
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
certainly
the
massachusetts
judge
have
--
has
no
advantage
does
he
over
the
pennsylvania
district
court
as
to
what
is
the
state
of
pennsylvania
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
doesn't
--
doesn't
prevent
you
bringing
the
suit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally
mr.
mcconnell
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
some
death
statute,
my
recollection
is
this
--
through
my
own
(inaudible)
limitation
is
a
matter
of
a
condition
to
bring
the
suit
not
merely
a
defense.
is
that
problem
involved
with
the
massachusetts'
statute
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
was
just
thinking
--
i
was
just
wondering,
notwithstanding
a
year,
the
statute
it
elapsed,
if
it's
a
matter
of
defense,
this
might
have
a
bearing,
you
know,
you
had
to
go
through
a
procedure
to
getting
ancillary
administration,
it
might
have
a
bearing
on
whether
or
not
for
the
purposes
of
the
rule
the
action
might
have
been
brought.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they
don't
have
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
a
waste
of
time
and
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
depends
on
whether
the
law
of
pennsylvania
applies
the
law
of
massachusetts
because
they
actually
happened
in
massachusetts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
it
hasn't
but
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
could
result
no
matter
where
you
try
it
and
you're
being
limited
to
$20,000.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
sure
you
are.
the
--
the
only
thing
that
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
fight
over
how
much
damages
you
can
get
if
you
can
prevail.
