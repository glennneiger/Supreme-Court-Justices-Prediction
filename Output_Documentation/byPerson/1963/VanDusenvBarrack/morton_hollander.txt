mr.
morton
hollander
yes.
mr.
morton
hollander
i'm
going
to
present
the
additional
argument
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
morton
hollander
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
get
into
my
principal
point,
which
will
be
that
it
was
improper
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
invoke
its
mandamus
power
in
this
case
for
the
reason
that
--
that
there
was
a
remedy
available
under
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
and
the
plaintiffs,
the
respondents
here,
failed
to
seek
relief
under
that
act.
and
for
the
further
reason
that
the
district
judge,
in
passing
on
this
transfer
motion,
in
no
way
act
that
in
excess
of
his
statutory
prescribed
jurisdiction
and
for
that
reason,
his
decision
on
the
transfer
motion
was
not
a
controllable
by
mandamus.
before
i
reach
those
reasons
with
respect
to
my
main
point,
i
would
like
to
advert
to
the
question
the
court
was
exploring
yesterday
afternoon.
that
is
the
question
as
to
whether,
first,
there
will
any
substantial
prejudice
resulting
to
the
plaintiffs
as
the
result
of
the
transfer
of
this
case
from
pennsylvania
to
massachusetts
and
whether
or
not
that
prejudice
effect,
if
the
contingency
of
prejudice
materializes
whether
that
factor
by
itself
constitutes
the
type
of
abusive
discretion
that
should've
precluded
the
district
judge
from
effecting
the
transfer.
i
would
like
to
say
with
respect
to
that
point
preliminarily
that
so
far
as
the
government,
so
far
as
the
united
states
is
concerned,
that
problem
has
no
--
no
relevance
at
all.
the
unites
states
is
exposed
to
liability
for
compensatory
damages
irrespective
of
any
state
statutory
ceiling
on
wrongful-death
actions.
under
the
tort
claims
act,
this
court
in
the
massachusetts'
bonding
case
held
that
the
federal
government
cannot
avail
itself
of
the
limits
of
liability
under
the
massachusetts'
law
even
with
respect
to
a
death
occurring
in
massachusetts.
and
the
district
judge
realized
this
and
--
and
noted
this
in
his
opinion,
and
noted
that
that
if
there
ever
should
be
ultimate
liability
adjudicated
as
against
the
unites
states,
the
united
states,
whether
the
case
is
tried
in
pennsylvania
or
in
massachusetts
and
irrespective
of
whether
or
not
the
pennsylvania
courts
accept
or
reject
kilberg,
the
potential
liability
of
the
united
states
is
--
is
unlimited.
that
is
it
will
be
based
on
compensatory
damages
suffered
by
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
morton
hollander
we're
speaking
--
my
argument
is
being
presented
on
behalf
of
all
of
the
petitioners,
but
i
do
want
to
point
that
that
one
of
the
petitioners
here
is
the
united
states.
the
united
states
is
one
of
the
four
or
five
defendants.
mr.
morton
hollander
no,
they're
not
--
mr.
morton
hollander
here,
they
--
mr.
morton
hollander
no.
they're
not
involved
with
the
massachusetts
bonding
case.
mr.
morton
hollander
i
think
it
will.
judge
van
dusen
thought
it
would
and
he
said
so.
mr.
morton
hollander
the
--
the
--
mr.
morton
hollander
all
of
the
other
defendants
in
--
in
response
to
--
to
your
earlier
question,
all
of
the
corporate
defendants,
eastern,
general
motors
and
lockheed
stated
at
page
two
of
their
reply
brief,
state
that
the
transferee
district
is
required
to
apply
the
law
of
the
transferor
district.
mr.
morton
hollander
including
its
conflict
through.
it's
exactly
what
they
say
including
its
choice
of
law
rules.
this
is
on
page
two
of
their
reply
brief
and
they
cite
a
--
a
host
of
cases.
now
the
--
the
district
judge
--
the
district
judge
went
into
this
problem.
it's
not
that
he
cavalierly
brushed
aside
the
--
the
problem
of
potential
prejudice
resulting
to
the
plaintiffs
as
a
--
if
the
transfer
were
effective
in
a
--
a
very
comprehensive,
a
very
well
reasoned
opinion.
he
goes
into
detail
with
respect
to
this
problem
and
takes
into
consideration
both
of
the
factors
that
i
had
mentioned,
namely
the
potential
unlimited
liability
of
the
united
states.
he
takes
into
account
the
rule
of
law
upon
which
the
corporate
defendants
rely,
namely
that
the
transferee
forum
takes
the
case
in
it's
entirely
with
all
of
the
legal
incidents
surrounding
it
and
just
as
if
it
had
been
tried
in
the
transferor
forum.
he
also
points
out,
the
district
judge
that
the
--
all
--
the
case
hasn't
been
adjudicated
so
far
as
liability
is
concerned.
it
maybe
that
--
it
maybe
and
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
there
will
be
no
ultimate
determination
of
liability
on
the
merits
as
against
some,
if
not,
all
of
the
defendants.
so
that
the
question
as
to
how
much
the
plaintiffs
will
recover
depends
on
a
--
mr.
morton
hollander
it
may
be
that
the
district
judge
trying
the
case
under
the
tort
claims
act
against
the
united
states
and
the
jury
trying
the
case
against
the
corporate
defendants
will
conclude
that
there
has
been
no
showing
of
actionable
negligence.
the
court
will
remember
that
this
was
somewhat
unusual
accident,
the
basic
claim
of
negligence
is
against
all
of
the
defendants
is
that
the
engines
on
this
lockheed
were
negligently
designed
so
that
they
were
conducive
to
bird
ingestion
and
that
the
united
states
government
somehow
should've
cleared
the
airways
of
--
of
birds
before
the
plane
took
off.
now,
it
may
be
--
it
may
be
that
the
--
the
defendants
will
be
able
to
convince
the
judge
and
the
jury
respectively
that
there
was
no
negligence
in
which
event,
all
of
these
broad
questions
is
to
transfer,
applicability
of
the
damages
recoverable
in
pennsylvania
as
opposed
to
those
in
massachusetts
will
never
become
pertinent
in
this
litigation.
the
district
judge
also
noted
that
the
specific
question
as
to
whether
or
not
kilberg
will
be
followed
by
the
pennsylvania
courts
was
in
active
litigation
in
the
pennsylvania
state
courts.
and
he
thought
and
i
think
quite
--
quite
correctly,
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
him
to
stay
his
hand
and
defer
any
ruling
on
the
damage
questions
until
the
state
supreme
court
had
spoken.
mr.
morton
hollander
that
was
his
--
that
was
his
--
that
was
his
plain
view.
now,
of
course,
this
question
was
not
passed
on
by
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
not
--
the
parties
do
not
directly
touch
on
it
in
their
briefs.
our
record
was
not
designated
with
the
view
to
developing
all
the
record
we
designated
for
the
--
for
this
court
after
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
granted,
it
was
not
developed
along
the
line
they're
focusing
on
this
point.
if
it
had
been,
we
would
have
included
in
our
--
in
the
record
an
opinion
handed
down
by
the
district
judge
after
the
opinion
which
is
included
in
the
record.
he
was
asked
to
amend
his
transfer
order
and
in
denying
the
motion
to
amend,
he
said
that
this
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
transferee
forum
is
required
to
follow
that
law
of
the
transferor
forum
including
the
choice
it
brought.
he
said
that
it
was
not
clear
in
his
mind
--
it
was
not
--
there
--
there
was
a
conflict
of
authority,
but
he
did
continue
to
say,
it
would
appear
to
this
district
judge
that
the
conflict
of
laws,
rules
of
the
transferor
district
would
govern
the
trial
of
these
cases
in
the
transferee
district.
this
is
--
in
his
opinion,
immediately
after
his
original
opinion
granting
the
transfer.
he
also
want
--
he
also
felt
that
the
damage
question
does
present
some
--
some
delicate
--
some
very
difficult
questions
as
to
constitutional
objections
to
the
carry
over
of
pennsylvania
public
policy
if
it
ultimately
--
it
should
be
determined
that
the
pennsylvania
would
follow
kilberg.
the
defendants
had
raised
for
example
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
requires
a
pennsylvania
court
to
apply
not
only
the
--
that
part
of
the
wrongful
death
act
of
massachusetts
that
creates
the
cause
of
action
for
wrongful
death.
mr.
morton
hollander
well
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
i
think
it's
a
question
this
court
know
and
ultimately
will
have
to
furnish
some
guideposts
to
the
lower
courts
and
--
mr.
morton
hollander
the
plaintiffs
--
the
plaintiffs
of
course
raise
a
constitutional
question
too
in
the
sense
that
they
claim
that
a
--
that
they're
--
that
their
clients
are
deprived
of
the
equal
protection
of
--
of
the
laws
unless
a
pennsylvania
resident
who
fortuitously
is
killed
in
a
neighboring
state
has
the
benefit
of
the
same
compensatory
damage
theory
of
liability
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes.
well
as
i
say,
so
far
as
the
united
states
is
concerned,
this
--
this
question
has
--
has
no
materiality
at
all.
mr.
morton
hollander
i
think
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
most
of
the
--
most
of
the
cases
that
we
cite
or
at
least
all
of
the
cases
that
are
cited
by
the
corporate
defendant
actually
imposes
a
condition
for
transfer
or
they
are
â€“
they
are
premised
on
the
notion
that
there
is
such
a
federal
conflict
through
all
--
that's
part
and
parcel
of
the
statutory
authority
to
effect
the
transfer
and
--
mr.
morton
hollander
it
would
be
entirely
--
it
would
be
entirely
reasonable.
it
would
be
entirely
reasonable
to
fashion
such
conflicts
rule
on
the
basis
of
the
transfer
authority
vested
in
the
district
courts
under
1404.
now,
i
think
in
these
circumstances
and
in
view
of
these
problems,
the
presence
of
the
constitutional
question
of
the
fact
that
the
state
courts
were
going
to
pass
on
the
problem
the
fact
that
the
district
judge
thought
that
the
transferee
forum
was
bound
by
the
law
of
the
transferor
forum,
the
fact
that
the
united
states
as
exposed
to
unlimited
liability,
all
of
these
considerations
it
seems
to
me
make
it
perfectly
clear
what
the
--
that
when
the
district
judge,
nevertheless
effected
the
transfer,
he
was
not
acting
in
such
a
fashion
that
it
could
be
properly
said
he
was
abusing
his
discretion.
indeed,
when
this
question
of
applicability
of
--
some
supposed
pennsylvania
kilberg
rule
to
the
cases,
if
the
cases
have
been
transferred
to
massachusetts.
when
this
question
was
the
sole
question
which
formed
the
basis
for
an
attack
on
the
district
judge's
transfer
order
by
certain
of
the
plaintiffs
involved
in
this
litigation,
they
filed
petitions
for
mandamus
with
the
court
of
appeals
limiting
themselves
just
to
this
one
question
concerning
which
my
remarks
this
morning
had
been
addressed,
the
substantial
prejudice
resulting
from
the
transfer
or
the
possible
prejudice
resulting
from
transfer.
when
that
was
the
only
ground
raised
in
a
petition
for
mandamus
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit,
the
panel,
a
very
distinguished
panel,
judges
biggs,
chief
judge
biggs
and
judge
goodrich
and
judge
hasty,
when
they
were
considering
only
that
contention,
they
denied
mandamus
and
implicit
in
their
rejection
was
the
view
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
that
there
had
been
no
abuse
of
discretion
committed
by
the
district
court
so
far
as
the
substantial
prejudice
argument
resulting
from
the
transfer
to
massachusetts
was
concerned.
it
was
only
after
additional,
additional
plaintiffs
raised,
they
might
have
been
brought
argument
requirement
namely
that
they're
failure
to
have
a
sort
appointment
as
administrated
in
massachusetts
before
they
filed
suit
in
philadelphia,
they
argued
that
that
precluded
the
transfer
because
their
failure
to
seek
(inaudible)
administration
in
massachusetts
prevented
the
massachusetts
forum
from
ever
becoming
a
district
in
which
the
actions
might
have
been
brought.
it
was
only
after
the
additional
plaintiffs
raised
that
particular
question
or
contention
in
their
petitions
for
mandamus
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
to
reexamine
the
issue
and
then
came
forth
with
the
opinion
that
we
had
thought
was
the
one
principally
involved
on
this
petition
for
certiorari.
the
court
of
appeals
of
course
in
that
opinion
held
that
is
a
result
that
they
might
have
been
brought
requirement
and
the
district
judge
was
precluded
from
effecting
a
transcript.
we
think
that
--
and
it
might
have
been
brought
requirement
restrictive
interpretation
of
1404
(a).
the
--
the
consequences
are
--
and
in
truth,
disastrous
so
far
as
that
litigation
is
concerned.
a
--
a
single
airplane
accident
has
a
--
given
rise
to
as
many
as
60
or
70
different
suits
just
against
the
government
in
about
19
or
20
different
district
courts.
mr.
morton
hollander
the
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well
it
--
there
of
course
on
this
record,
there's
been
no
showing
of
--
there's
been
no
showing
that
the
plaintiffs
are
in
any
way
impecunious
or
unable
to
defray
the
costs
of
this
litigation.
i
don't
think
the
question
of
relative
cause
is
important
mr.
justice
goldberg
there.
i
don't
think
that
it's
the
sole
criteria
and
there
are
after
all
many
additional
far
reaching
considerations.
one
of
which
i
think
turns
on
the
effective
functioning
of
the
federal
judiciary.
it
--
it
seems
to
me
to
be
unseemly
to
have
19
district
judges
particularly
in
view
of
the
tremendous
congestion
in
so
many
of
metropolitan
areas
to
have
19
different
district
judges.
going
over
the
same
law,
the
same
facts
with
respect
to
the
same
accident
of
--
where
it
would
be
--
and
i
think
it
was
the
principal
beneficial
purpose
of
section
1404
(a)
as
well
as
the
rules
authorizing
consolidation
where
it
would
be
obviously
desirable
in
--
in
view
of
the
--
the
need
for
conserving
the
time
and
effort
of
--
of
federal
judges
to
gather
these
cases
together
in
one
district
even
if
some
plaintiffs
in
some
situation
are
put
to
some
additional
expense
--
mr.
morton
hollander
and
--
mr.
morton
hollander
over
114
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
to
--
actually
in
--
in
--
or
in
actual
practice,
after
these
cases
have
been
transferred
if
the
district
court's
order
is
reinstated,
the
district
judge
usually
will
select
the
test
or
composite
case
for
trial
or
--
mr.
morton
hollander
oh
yes.
mr.
morton
hollander
with
respect
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes.
but
i
don't
think
it's
a
--
a
problem
that
--
be
too
difficult
for
a
district
judge
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
or
even
a
jury
to
cope
with.
mr.
morton
hollander
not
--
not
in
an
area
where
the
--
not
in
an
area
where
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
has
not
yet
spoken.
in
fact
where
everything
that
it
has
said
seems
to
be
entirely
inconsistent
with
the
application
--
mr.
morton
hollander
no,
not
unless
they
should
as
they
may
very
well
be
forthcoming
in
the
interim
before
final
adjudication
of
liability
if
that
contingency
is
ever
realized
unless
they
should
be
forthcoming
in
the
interims
some
clear
expression
formulation
have
used
by
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes.
i
--
i
--
mr.
morton
hollander
i
myself
think
it
outrageous
for
so
many
cases
to
be
tried
in
so
many
district
--
different
district
courts
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well
i
--
i
would
certainly
think
that
if
the
interest
of
justice,
a
criteria
under
1404
(a)
means
anything,
it
certainly
gives
this
court
sufficient
latitude
to
take
that
factor
of
economy
of
judicial
effort
and
time
into
consideration.
mr.
morton
hollander
because
if
you
don't
--
if
you
don't,
you
really
forestall
all
the
litigants
who
properly
are
waiting
to
have
their
cases
tried
and
adjudicated
in
that
particular
busy
court.
you
force
them
to
--
you
deny
them
--
you
deny
them
justice
by
forcing
additional
delays
on
them.
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
it
may
--
that
may
--
that
may
--
mr.
morton
hollander
and
that's
--
that's
a
--
it's
a
possibility.
the
likelihood
of
all
of
the
cases
--
of
all
the
cases
being
effectively
wrapped
up
and
terminated
though,
i
think
depends
in
larger
degree
on
the
extent
to
which
a
particular
district
court
has
power
and
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
all
of
the
cases.
mr.
morton
hollander
no,
mr.
justice
white.
not
so
far
as
i
know.
mr.
morton
hollander
i
think
the
only
two
jurisdictions
of
--
are
massachusetts
where
there
are
114
and
those
that
are
involved
in
pennsylvania,
approximately
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well
--
mr.
morton
hollander
there
are
--
there
are.
yes,
your
honor.
i
mean,
there
are
--
there
are
cases
actually
now
pending
in
the
pennsylvania
courts
arising
out
of
this
disaster.
mr.
morton
hollander
no.
they're
in
the
state
courts
your
honor.
no,
they
cannot
be
transferred
and
i
suppose
that
it
will
be
necessary
for
the
--
for
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
to
reach
out
and
--
and
decide
that
issue.
and
of
course
i
--
mr.
morton
hollander
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
quite
--
mr.
morton
hollander
oh
yes,
they've
brought
--
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
that
--
that's
a
--
it
will
--
will
be
necessary
for
either
their
present
attorneys
in
philadelphia
to
retain
a
--
a
counsel
up
in
massachusetts
over
the
plaintiffs
to
get
themselves
additional
attorneys.
mr.
morton
hollander
more
courts
dealing
with
these
issues?
mr.
morton
hollander
it
might,
i
think
it
would
--
i
think
it
would
work
havoc.
i
think
it'll
be
--
can
create
--
even
more
chaotic
conditions
than
are
now
being
experienced.
it
would
defeat,
i
--
i
think
it
would
defeat
entirely
the
beneficial
purposes
of
1404
(a)
as
well
as
consolidation.
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
a
--
a
court
having
all
of
the
cases
in
its
--
in
its
lap
should
be
able
to
device
some
practical
procedures
so
as
to
select
a
single
case
per
trial,
have
a
group
of
working
attorneys
selected
so
that
it
won't
be
necessary
for
there
to
be
60
serving
in
different
--
different
--
60
or
70
different
attorneys
raising
objections
with
respect
to
every
question.
these
--
we
had
somewhat
similar
experience
in
the
texas
city
disaster
litigation
where
there
were
literally
hundreds
of
plaintiffs
but
it
--
under
proper
rules
laid
down
by
the
district
judge,
these
--
the
problems
are
very
workable.
mr.
morton
hollander
it
certainly
didn't
take
any
longer
your
honor
than
it
will
to
decide
these
cases
because
the
plaintiffs
are
--
were
allowed
to
run
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
get
review
of
an
interlocutory
transfer
order.
the
cases
started
in
1960.
the
district
judge
transferred
the
cases
about
a
year
and
a
half
later.
still
a
year
later,
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
cases
should
stay
in
massachusetts
and
philadelphia.
today,
four
years
after
the
accident
and
approximately
three
and
a
half
years
after
the
suits
were
filed,
we're
still
troubled
by
the
question
as
to
where
the
cases
should
be
tried,
not
whether
any
of
the
defendants
were
negligent
and
if
they
were,
how
much
would
the
damages
be.
but
we
haven't
--
has
yet
solved
the
question
as
to
where
these
cases
should
be
tried
and
that
factor
i
think
--
that
factor
i
think
is
of
extreme
importance
with
respect
to
--
in
the
--
in
the
question
i
had
set
in
my
opening
remarks,
i
did
want
to
address
myself
to
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
writ
of
mandamus
is
at
all
available
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
challenge
and
to
upset
a
district
court
transfer
order.
mr.
morton
hollander
the
district
judge
in
massachusetts
is
waiting
for
this
court
to
decide
whether
he's
going
to
have
all
of
the
cases
as
judge
van
dusen
ordered
or
whether
he
should
go
ahead
and
try
just
the
114.
that's
entirely
understandable
because
he's
afraid
that
if
he
goes
ahead
even
with
pretrial,
the
transferred
cases,
if
they
ultimately
are
transferred,
the
lawyers
in
those
transferred
cases
will
contend
that
they're
not
bound
at
all
by
any
of
the
pretrial
orders
of
proceedings
because
they
had
opportunity
to
participate.
now,
if
--
mr.
morton
hollander
no.
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
they're
not
--
not
this
time
your
honor,
although
as
i
point
the
night
before,
i
think
that
goodrich,
biggs
and
hasty
did
reach
that
question
and
they
decided
there
was
no
abuse
of
discretion
but
this
panel
consisting
of
judge
staley
and
judge
forman
and
district
judge
lane,
they
said
in
their
opinion
that
they
are
not
touching
any
question
of
abusive
discretion.
they're
not
--
mr.
morton
hollander
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
in
the
--
the
--
i
think
the
interest
of
orderly
administration
of
justice
actually
dictate
in
a
case
of
this
sort
even
though
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
second
go-round
did
not
reach,
although
as
i
say,
i
think
in
the
first
round,
they
did
reach
this
question.
i
think
that
rather
than
sending
this
case
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
with
an
opportunity
to
them
to
go
again
into
this
problem.
i
think
the
case
should
go
back
to
judge
van
dusen
with
an
instruction
to
reinstate
his
transfer
order
and
then
after
these
case
has
had
been
finally
adjudicated,
if
there
is
any
prejudice
at
all
resulting
or
that
will
have
resulted
to
the
plaintiffs
because
of
the
transfer,
then
i
think
they
can
challenge
the
interlocutory
transfer
order
and
any
prejudice
flowing
from
it.
they
can
challenge
it
as
the
traditional
federal
policy
against
the
piecemeal
appeals
indeed
requires
them
to
challenge
it
after
--
after
a
final
adjudication
of
liability,
after
a
complete
wrap
up
in
disposition
of
the
case
by
means
of
a
final
judgment,
it
will
still
be
open
to
them
to
challenge
it.
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
i
think
that
that
--
mr.
morton
hollander
i
think
that
that
would
--
i
think
that
we
would
ask
this
court
in
that
event
to
reinstate
the
district
judge's
transfer
order.
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
that's
of
course
the
other
alternative.
i
--
i
myself
think
that
it
--
it
would
just
mean
adding
another
or
two
or
three
years
delay
to
this
--
to
this
case,
the
situation
where
the
--
as
i
said
the
case
has
been
pending
for
over
four
years
and
the
courts
don't
know
--
the
district
courts
don't
know
themselves
where
it's
to
be
tried.
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
morton
hollander
massachusetts?
no,
mr.
justice
clark,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
that
massachusetts'
district
judge
is
reluctant
to
go
ahead
and
try
these
cases
and
in
the
event
that
this
court
reinstates
or
in
event
the
district
court's
transfer
order
is
ultimately
upheld
or
reinstated,
it
would
be
necessary
for
him
to
go
through
extensive
pretrial
and
perhaps
trial
procedures
because
if
pretrial
and
trial
procedures
through
which
he
would
now
go
through
with
respect
to
the
114
cases
now
pending
would
of
course
not
be
binding
on
the
plaintiffs
in
the
massachusetts
cases.
mr.
morton
hollander
it
depends
of
course
on
how
the
liability
question
is
adjudicated.
i'm
quite
confident
that
the
plaintiffs
in
philadelphia
would
not
feel
themselves
bound
by
any
adjudication
of
no
liability
in
massachusetts.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
i
--
i
--
it's
--
it's
more
than
five
of
course
your
honor.
and
actually
there
are
--
there
were
55
cases
originally
in
philadelphia.
there
are
actually
37
cases
that
were
ordered
transferred
by
--
by
--
mr.
morton
hollander
your
honor,
no
there
are
--
well,
those
five
cases
referred
to
the
five
captions
in
the
courts
of
appeals
but
there
are
37
different
civil
actions
in
the
district
court
that
--
that
were
ordered
transferred.
there
are
complicating
considerations
because
this
is
not
going
to
be
tried
to
a
judge
so
far
the
corporate
defendants
are
concerned
though
there
have
to
be
jury
trials
of
course
so
far
as
the
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
i
--
i
would
suppose
that
the
questions
could
go
to
the
jury
or
with
special
instructions
with
respect
to
pennsylvania
residents
if
it
should
turn
out
that
kilberg
is
adopted
in
pennsylvania
in
the
meanwhile
that
the
massachusetts
--
that
ceiling
is
not
--
i
--
i
think
it's
entirely
workable.
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
i
--
i
have
no
personal
experience
but
i
--
it
would
seem
to
me
that
under
proper
instructions
a
jury
should
come
up
with
the
--
with
the
correct
result
otherwise
its
verdict
could
be
set
aside.
mr.
morton
hollander
they
had
no
opinion
your
honor.
they
issued
an
order
denying
the
petition
for
mandamus
where
the
petition
for
mandamus
was
based
exclusively
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
on
the
--
it's
in
the
record
at
--
mr.
morton
hollander
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
you
mean
by
the
procedural
points.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
my
point
that
the
first
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
biggs,
goodrich
and
hasty
had
before
it
a
petition
for
mandamus
alleging
abuse
of
discretion,
alleging
substantial
prejudice
that
would
possibly
result
if
the
kilberg
rule
were
ultimately
adopted
in
pennsylvania.
notwithstanding
those
assertions,
that
panel
refused
to
grant
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
the
petition
for
mandamus
and
i
think
implicit
in
that
refusal
is
a
value
judgment
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
if
that's
all
you're
complaining
about,
you
don't
have
enough
to
trigger
us
to
grant
the
extraordinary
writ
of
mandamus.
when
they
might
have
been
broad
argument
was
raised,
the
picture
was
entirely
different
so
far
as
the
thinking
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
concerned
because
then
--
then
they
did
grant
--
grant
mandamus
but
on
an
entirely
different
panel.
mr.
morton
hollander
the
order
denying
--
mr.
morton
hollander
the
petitions
for
mandamus
--
mr.
morton
hollander
--
are
set
forth
at
page
49
and
page
50.
mr.
morton
hollander
there
were
two
separate
orders
denying
those.
mr.
morton
hollander
we
don't
--
we
don't.
we
don't.
my
point
is
this
--
my
point
is
this
that
when
that's
the
only
question
in
the
case,
it
was
improper
for
the
court
to
issue
mandamus
whether
it
was
improper
for
the
court
to
issue
mandamus
because
they
felt
that
they
were
barred
by
the
plaintiff's
failure
to
invoke
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
or
whether
they
felt
that
mandamus
was
barred
because
the
necessary
abuse
of
discretion.
now
it
seems
--
seems
to
be
immaterial.
in
both
instances,
they
felt
that
the
district
judge
--
judge's
order
should
not
be
set
aside
on
mandamus
but
that
if
there
--
still
will
be
any
prejudice
or
harm
resulting
to
the
plaintiffs,
the
determination
of
this
entire
proceedings,
the
appropriate
time
to
raise
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
the
transfer
is
after
final
judgment
has
been
entered.
mr.
morton
hollander
it
--
it
--
it
--
let
--
let
me
--
let
me
backtrack
just
a
bit.
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
of
the
view
as
it
apparently
indicated
in
its
opinion
in
this
case
that
the
interlocutory
or
the
failure
to
exhaust
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
is
not
a
bar
to
their
issuance
of
mandamus,
i
would
suppose
that
it
would
be
entirely
proper
to
imply
from
the
court
of
appeals'
refusal
to
issue
the
writ
that
they
were
not
relying
on
that
ground
but
that
they
were
relying
on
the
ground
that
there
has
been
no
abuse
of
discretion.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
says
that
they
had
earlier
ruled
that
the
interlocutory
appeals
act,
that
the
failure
to
exhaust
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
was
not
at
bar.
if
i
may
your
honor,
address
myself
to
just
one
aspect
--
mr.
morton
hollander
i
don't
think
so
your
honor
and
as
i
say,
the
district
judge
did
not
think
so
and
all
of
the
corporate
defendants
take
the
position
that
the
law
to
be
applied
in
the
transferee
forum
will
be
precisely
the
same
as
the
law
that
would've
been
applied
had
the
cases
stayed
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
morton
hollander
the
law
of
pennsylvania?
the
law
that
pennsylvania
was
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well,
my
remarks
of
course
are
directed
to
the
troublesome
question
as
to
the
damage
issue
because
obviously
--
mr.
morton
hollander
the
--
the
law
of
massachusetts
gives
these
plaintiffs
the
right
to
maintain
along
--
mr.
morton
hollander
oh,
the
law
of
pennsylvania
your
honor.
that's
our
whole
point
that
the
--
mr.
morton
hollander
oh
yes,
your
honor.
and
that's
what
the
district
judge
said
in
that
quotation
on
--
mr.
morton
hollander
oh
no,
that's
our
position.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes
--
yes
your
honor.
mr.
morton
hollander
that
--
that
may
very
well
be
the
ultimate
determination
of
the
pennsylvania
--
mr.
morton
hollander
right.
mr.
morton
hollander
yes,
and
that's
why
i
say
there's
no
prejudice
--
mr.
morton
hollander
well
the
laws
of
pennsylvania
including
the
pennsylvania's
conflict,
the
choice
of
the
rules
proposition
--
mr.
morton
hollander
it's
--
its
--
its
entire
pennsylvania
law
including
its
conflicts
rules.
mr.
morton
hollander
i'm
sorry
i
misled
you.
mr.
morton
hollander
not
yet.
no,
your
honor.
thank
you
very
much.
