time,
i
think
you
better

we
better
get
the
rest
from

for
questions
that
we

we
asked
and
i
would
like
to
ask
you
one
question.
you,
early
in
your
argument,
you
started
to
tell
us
whether
there
was
anyway
in
which
the
plaintiffs
in
these
cases
could
be
prejudiced
by
the
transfer
order
and
then
you
were
diverted
i
think
by
questions
that
were
asked.
is
there
any
way
by
which
these
people
might
be
prejudiced
as
a
result
of
this
order?
