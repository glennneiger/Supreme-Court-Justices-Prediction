mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
mr.
chief
justice,
with
submission
to
your
honors,
morton
hollander
of
the
civil
division
of
the
department
of
justice
and
i
will
share
the
argument
on
petitioner's
behalf.
the
issue
which
we
present
to
your
honors,
is
whether
the
district
court
judge,
the
honorable
francis
van
dusen
of
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania,
had
power
or
authority
under
the
wording
of
section
1404
(a)
of
judicial
code
to
transfer
to
the
district
of
massachusetts.
these
45
actions,
40
wrongful
death
actions,
five
personal
injury
actions,
whether
he
had
authority,
you
transfer
them
to
massachusetts,
the
district
where
the
action
had
occurred,
where
at
the
time
of
argument,
114
other
actions
arising
out
of
the
same
accident
where
had
been
instituted
and
where
he
found
that
it
would
be
for
the
convenience
of
witness
--
witnesses
and
in
the
interest
of
justice
and
massachusetts
being
the
only
jurisdiction
where
all
defendants,
where
venue
and
jurisdiction
was
proper
as
to
all
defendants.
in
reaching
that
conclusion,
he
considered
an
argument
which
been
made
by
some
of
the
plaintiffs
that
he
lacked
power
because
the
plaintiffs,
the
fiduciary
representative
plaintiffs,
had
not
been
--
had
not
taken
out
ancillary
appointments
in
massachusetts.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
limiting
words
in
1404
(a)
where
it
might
have
been
brought,
where
the
action
might
have
been
brought,
prevented
the
transfer
of
these
actions
because
of
the
failure
of
these
plaintiffs
to
obtain
ancillary
appointments
prior
to
instituting
the
suits
in
pennsylvania,
that
is
obtaining
ancillary
appointments
in
massachusetts
prior
to
obtaining
--
to
instituting
the
suits
in
pennsylvania.
and
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
it
was
constrained
to
do
this
on
the
reading
of
your
honors'
opinion
in
hoffman
against
blaski.
now,
if
your
honor
pleases,
the
facts,
brief
are
these.
on
october
the
4th,
1968,
commercial
airliner,
very
shortly
after
takeoff
crashed
in
the
boston
harbor,
is
taken
off
from
logan
international
airport
in
boston.
it
had
onboard
67
passengers
and
a
crew
of
five,
10
--
there
were
10
survivors.
114
actions
were
started
in
the
district
of
massachusetts.
they
were
started
against
eastern,
the
operator
of
the
airline
--
the
airplane,
against
lockheed,
the
manufacturer
of
the
plane
against
general
motors
corporation,
the
manufacturer
of
the
engines,
against
the
united
states
and
in
some
cases,
against
the
massachusetts
port
authority.
jurisdiction
in
massachusetts
was
of
course,
under
--
under
section
1391
(a)
of
the
judicial
code
as
to
the
corporate
defendants.
under
section
1402
(b),
the
federal
tort
claims
act
as
the
united
states
and
as
to
the
massachusetts
port
authority,
again
under
section
1391
(a)
that
being
the
only
jurisdiction
in
which
the
massachusetts
port
authority
could
be
sued.
the
55
actions
which
were
instituted
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
were
instituted,
seven
of
them
in
admiralty,
21
against
the
corporate
defendants,
that
is
eastern
airlines,
general
motors
corporation
and
lockheed.
there
were
20
suits
against
the
united
states,
four
suits
against
all
defendants,
that
is
those
four
defendants
and
three
suits
against
eastern
airlines
alone.
10
of
those
suits
were
disposed
of,
seven
in
admiralty,
judge
van
dusen
dismissed
and
subsequently,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
reinstated
them.
a
petition
for
certiorari
which
is
presented
to
this
court
was
denied
in
connection
with
those
cases
so
they
are
now
reinstated
and
we
had
filed
--
defendants
had
filed
on
a
motion
to
transfer
as
to
those
so
actually,
the
ruling
here
will
also
govern
those
cases.
now
if
your
honors
please,
a
consideration
of
the
history
of
delimiting
words
in
section
--
of
section
1404
(a),
we
believe
shows
quite
clearly
that
it
does
not
permit
state
law
to
prevent
the
transfer
of
cases,
that
it
is
limited,
it
is
a
venue
and
jurisdiction
section.
it
was
enacted
at
the
time
the
judicial
--
of
the
revision
of
the
judicial
code
in
its
entirety
in
1948.
it
appears
in
chapter
87,
the
venue
and
jurisdiction
section.
and
it
was
based
on
the
old
common
law,
judge
made
doctrine
of
--
for
unknown
convenience.
and
as
your
honors
well
know,
if
there
was
an
alternate
jurisdiction
available
then
the
courts
could
dismiss
assuming
that
an
action
could
be
brought
in
the
alternate
jurisdiction.
now,
1404
(a)
was
shown,
i
think
by
the
revisers
notes
and
also
by
the
earlier
decisions
of
this
court
to
have
been
enacted
to
give
a
broader
power
of
transfer
that
existed
under
that
preexisting
right
to
dismiss.
the
purpose
was
to
restrict
plaintiffs
in
their
choice
of
forum
and
also
to
give
a
guide
to
the
district
courts
and
to
restrict
them
in
their
transfers
so
that
the
transfers
would
be
restricted
to
districts
where
the
actions
might
have
been
brought
under
federal
statutes
governing
venue
and
jurisdiction.
the
--
those
sections
run
from
section
30
--
1391
through
section
1406
of
the
code.
and
if
you
take
the
words
which
are
used
in
those
various
sections,
for
example,
1391
(a)
and
(c)
under
which
jurisdiction
here
attaches
to
the
corporate
defendants,
the
words
are,
"maybe
brought,"
if
you
take
section
1402
(b)
under
which
jurisdiction
attaches
to
united
states,
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
the
words
are,
"maybe
prosecuted."
the
words
of
1404
(a)
under
which
defendants
here
moved
for
transfer
are
"might
have
been
brought."
now,
the
similarity
of
those
words
and
the
history
we
believe
show
that
this
is
a
venue
and
jurisdiction
test.
it's
a
statute,
it's
a
--
it's
a
section
which
was
to
broaden
a
power
to
transfer.
now,
what
is
the
effect
of
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
here
in
holding
that
delimiting
words
where
it
might
have
been
brought
go
beyond
venue
and
jurisdiction
and
also
force
consideration
of
state
restriction?
in
this
case,
limitations
on
the
right
of
the
fiduciary
to
bring
suit,
massachusetts
saying
that
suit
must
--
that
there
must
be
ancillary
letters
before
suit
can
be
instituted.
but
the
state
law
or
--
might
just
as
well
be
a
requirement
of
a
filing
of
a
bond
to
cover
cost
or
the
appointment
of
an
agent
for
service
so
that
it
would
leave
in
the
hands,
this
decision,
it
is
permitted
us
to
stand,
leaves
in
the
hands
of
plaintiffs
a
complete
choice
of
the
forum
in
which
they
proceed
or
they
could
institute
suit
as
they
did
here
without
applying
for
ancillary
letters
in
massachusetts
or
if
it
were
a
--
if
a
state
statute
were
one
of
filing
a
bond,
they
could
--
to
cover
cost,
they
could
institute
suit
as
they
did
here
in
the
eastern
district
and
file
a
bond
10
days
later
in
another
district
but
under
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
here,
delimiting
words
would
prevent
a
transfer
even
though
there's
nothing
in
the
situation
which
would
in
any
way
affect
the
substantive
issues
in
the
case.
the
results
of
the
case
or
in
these
cases,
even
the
distribution
of
funds
recovered
if
there
is
a
recovery.
the
plaintiffs
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
yes.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
if
your
honor
please,
you've
raised
there
as
a
hypothetic
question.
in
fact,
there
is
one
case
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question,
entirely
in
the
point.
the
felchlin
case
in
texas
where
the
motion
for
transfer
was
made
in
california
and
transfer
was
denied
because
under
texas
law,
there
is
no
right
of
action
in
a
foreign
fiduciary.
we
say
to
that
that
we
think
it
was
improperly
decided
and
that
it
is
a
question
--
that
case
was
decided
before
your
honors'
decision
in
the
three
cases
in
which
you
have
decide
--
discussed
these
limiting
words
before
hoffman,
blaski,
sullivan
and
behimer,
and
the
continental
grain
company.
and
actually,
this
consideration
is
not
one
of
power
or
authority.
it's
a
consideration
by
the
district
court
of
--
in
the
interest
of
justice.
the
transfer
should
deny
--
need
be
denied
and
the
interest
of
justice
in
that
sort
of
a
case
under
1404
(a)
because
it's
going
back
to
the
old
for
unknown
convenience
doctrine
where
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
dismissal
if
there
--
if
there
was
no
alternate
jurisdiction.
and
we
say
that
actually,
that
is
the
knob
of
the
--
this
isn't
a
case
of
lack
of
power
or
of
jurisdiction.
these
things
are
the
capacity
to
sue,
is
not
a
power
or
jurisdiction
question,
it
is
an
interest
in
the
interest
of
justice
question.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
way
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
yes,
your
honor
and
that
has
been
the
result
in
so
many
decisions
of
these
transfer
cases
where
the
transferring
court
--
the
transferrer
court
has
imposed
either
a
condition
that
the
statute
of
limitations
of
the
transferee
district
will
not
defeat
the
right
or
has
imposed
the
--
the
condition
that
the
law
of
the
transferor
jurisdiction
will
apply.
we
cite
in
our
brief
a
number
of
cases,
the
case
of
gulf
oil
--
of
gilbert
against
gulf
oil
company
which
set
down
the
--
which
is
the
classic
case
for
the
test
to
be
applied
by
a
judge
in
considering
transfer,
was
a
case
of
statute
of
limitations,
the
transfer
being
made
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
statute
of
limitations
of
the
transferee
district
was
different.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
as
to
limitation,
now
your
honor,
i'm
not
certain
that
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
oh
yes,
if
your
honor
please,
that
judge
van
dusen
specifically
refers
--
he
considers
it
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
he
did
not,
he
said
that
that
the
--
he
said
that
at
this
point,
that
question
really
was
not
right
for
decision
but
that
he
had
considered
it
and
that
it
did
not
go
to
jurisdiction,
that
it
was
a
question
of
the
interest
of
justice.
and
he
said
that
--
this
appears
at
pages
12
and
13,
your
honor,
its
consideration
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
transcript.
and
he
says
that
the
transferee
court
will
be
better
able
to
pass
on
these
questions
if
necessary.
he
considered
it
from
the
--
from
the
angles
one
that
it
was
--
this
was
not
the
time
to
consider
that.
that's
a
trial
question.
secondly,
that
under
the
present
pennsylvania
decisions,
pennsylvania
--
and
bantered
of
pennsylvania's
conflict
of
law
of
rule,
there
can
be
no
question
but
that
the
massachusetts
limit
--
limitation
would
apply
no
matter
which
district
the
cases
are
tried
in.
and
that
i
think
is
playing
from
the
cases
which
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief.
the
pennsylvania
cases
and
the
decisions
of
our
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit,
the
case
of
(inaudible)
against
the
united
states
which
was
decided
and
in
applying
the
pennsylvania
law
imported
the
limitation
on
damages
--
oh
i
believe
it
was
virginia.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
under
the
decisions
your
honor,
not
if
he
considered
it
in
his
discretionary
power,
and
decided.
the
cases
are
taken
that
even
though
the
exercise
of
discretion
may
have
been
in
the
opinion
of
the
reviewing
court,
may
not
have
gone
far
enough
or
they
would
not
have
agreed
with
it.
it
is
a
matter
of
discretion
which
subsequently
can
be
passed
upon
on
appeal.
if
not
one
that
he
has
to
decide
in
advance
and
decide
correctly
in
advance.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
no,
your
honors
please.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
think
since
that
is
essentially
a
question
of
substantive
law
to
be
decided
at
the
time
of
trial.
this
would
be
certainly,
considerably
in
the
event
of
the
proper
time
to
decide
it.
certainly,
if
your
honors
--
your
honors
would
have
the
power
to
decide
that.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
if
your
honors
--
not
beyond
what
has
been
wasted
here
by
what
we
consider
is
an
erroneous
interpretation
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
issuing
a
writ
of
mandamus
in
a
--
in
a
field
where
it
is
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge.
the
--
your
honors
there
as
decided
here
wouldn't
--
would
not
delay
it
anymore
from
this
point
on.
the
delay
has
been
as
a
result
of
the
error
here
forth.
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
no,
the
consideration
of
it.
yes,
but
not
the
determination
of
what
it
is.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
that's
right.
he
thought
that
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
at
this
time
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
that's
right.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
that's
right,
he
thought
that
at
this
time,
he
should
abstain
from
deciding
what
was
an
undecided
--
what
plaintiffs
say
is
an
undecided
question
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
yes,
your
honor.
then
i
think
it
would've
been
and
i
think
he
could've
governed
transfer.
i
mean
if
it
weren't
clear
that
way.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
they
could
have
been
a
govern
transfer
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
yes,
i
think
it
probably
would
have
been.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
because
i
think
his
decision
your
honor
was
quite
correct
under
the
admonition
in
the
many
cases
which
this
court
has
handed
down
saying
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
saying
that
where
a
question
has
not
been
decided
by
a
state
court
and
assuming
it
hasn't
in
pennsylvania
and
we
submit
that
it
has
and
it's
perfectly
clear
that
it
has
under
the
pennsylvania.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
it
has.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
oh
yes.
the
pennsylvania
decision
or
the
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
well,
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
think
that
his
own
court
of
appeals
and
the
(inaudible)
case,
i
am
certain
he
refers
to
it
in
his
opinion.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
he's
not
waiting
--
he's
not
waiting
on
the
pennsylvania
law.
he
is
saying
that
the
pennsylvania
law,
under
its
conflict
of
laws
applies
the
law
of
massachusetts.
now,
he
says
that
it
is
possible
that
this
question
may
be
decided
by
the
pennsylvania
court,
contrary
to
that.
it
hasn't
yet
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
but
therefore,
it
isn't
for
him
to
decide
it
under
the
admonitions
which
this
court
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
but
if
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
if
your
honor
pleases,
the
pennsylvania
law
will
apply
on
the
transfer
anyway
under
the
state
of
the
law
as
it
exists
today.
and
if
your
honors
--
the
pennsylvania
cases
and
we
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
yes.
that
--
that
is
the
--
that's
already
the
circuit
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
case
is
on
circuit.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
i'm
saying
that
on
this
--
that
on
this
case,
the
action
being
based
on
the
wrongful
death
statute
of
massachusetts.
it
has
no
other
place
to
go
except
to
consider
what
the
pennsylvania
conflict
rule.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
in
both
jurisdictions.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
if
--
if
the
pennsylvania
question
on
which
your
honor,
but
this
is
your
question
to
me,
is
undecided,
then
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
massachusetts
court
under
the
pennsylvania
con
--
might
be
just
as
confident
for
it
to
decide.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
after
the
transfer?
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
if
your
honor
pleases,
that
would
depend
on
whether
a
condition
were
imposed
upon
it
by
the
transferring
judge
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
if
he
felt
that
the
question
was
undecided
in
pennsylvania,
he
might
have.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
but
he
didn't
because
this
question
--
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
question
about
pennsylvania.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
the
substantive
law
would
be
the
wrongful
death
statute
of
massachusetts
to
any
--
both
on
the
right
of
action
and
on
its
limitation
of
damages.
now,
that
would
be
the
substantive
law
both
under
the
massachusetts
death
statute
and
under
the
decisions
of
pennsylvania,
under
its
conflict
of
law's
ruling,
no
matter
where
it's
tried.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
yes.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
that
i
think
your
honor
in
the
--
in
the
face
of
a
pennsylvania
rule
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
but
this
--
but
this
is
under
your
transfer
statute,
your
section
1404.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
whether
it's
in
the
interest
of
justice
there
to
--
to
subject
a
pennsylvania
plaintiff
to
the
contrary
statute.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
if
it
were
sustained,
certainly,
then
i
think
would
be
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
--
it
would
be
proper
having
been
sustained.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
as
the
law
presently
expands,
yes,
sir
because
it
is
perfectly
inclined
that
under
the
pennsylvania
law,
the
--
the
law
where
accident
or
where
the
action
arises
controls
both
the
action
and
the
measure
of
damages.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
yes.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
oh
if
your
honor
pleases,
that'd
be
a
question
on
appeal
of
error
by
the
trial
court
in
applying
the
wrong
measure
of
damages,
not
for
this
extraordinary
proceeding
which
brings
us
before
your
honor
to
that,
that's
the
usual
course.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
the
transfer
--
the
substantive
law
at
this
time
is
not
even
technically,
of
course
we
can't
argue
with
that
but
really
isn't
before
the
court.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
yes.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
yes.
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
no,
it
should
not.
it
should
not
in
any
way
be
effective
by
a
transfer
and
there
are
a
great
many
cases
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
which
say
that
it
is
not
affected
by
the
transfer
at
all.
the
transfer
and
the
purposes
of
the
statute
were
to
cut
down
expense,
to
consolidate
cases
for
trial,
to
eliminate
duplication
and
to
prevent
foreign
shopping.
now,
if
your
honors
please
--
mr.
owen
b.
rhoads
i
do,
and
we
do.
now,
if
your
honors
pleases,
what
is
the
effect
of
this
ruling?
and
let's
--
if
i
may
just
take
it
in
two
districts
in
which
this
decision
of
the
third
circuit
has
already
fragmentize
suits.
the
goranson
case
and
the
tompkins
case
which
are
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
two
cases,
one
which
are
--
the
goranson
which
originated
in
the
--
in
ohio
district
court
and
was
transferred
to
virginia
where
the
accident
had
occurred.
i'm
sorry,
that's
--
and
the
tompkins
case
where
three
cases
were
started
against
capital
airlines
in
new
york.
now,
the
new
york
judge
held
that
only
one
of
those
cases
could
be
transferred.
he
said
that
he
disagreed
with
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
but
there
is
no
point
in
transferring
it
because
he
had
seen
what
had
happened
in
the
goranson
case
where
the
virginia
court
had
remanded
to
ohio
after
transfer.
so
that
as
the
result
of
barrack
in
those
capital
airline
cases,
you
now
have
a
suit
being
tried
in
ohio,
arising
out
of
a
death,
the
suit
being
tried
in
virginia
for
the
same
death
and
two
suits
being
tried
in
new
york.
now,
even
going
further,
this
also
affects
1406
act.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
in
three
cases
in
which
there
were
--
was
improper
venue,
the
body
case,
the
breath
and
rights
cases,
the
transfer
had
been
proper.
now
certainly,
the
words
of
1406
(a)
could
have
been
brought,
don't
differ
really
from
might
have
been
brought.
after
our
--
the
petition
had
been
filed
in
this
court,
that
was
called
to
the
court
of
appeals'
attention
and
a
modification
of
that
opinion
with
respect
to
those
three
cases.
the
opinion
was
amended
so
that
the
body,
their
being
an
administrator
in
massachusetts
was
transferred
and
the
court
said
that
it
did
not
pass
on
the
breath
or
rights
cases.
but
what
is
the
effect
under
1406
(a),
the
improper
venue
section
where
it
says
that
cases
shall
be
dismissed?
it
means
that
the
court,
our
court
must
transfer
--
does
it
mean
that
it
must
transfer
breath
and
rights
one
to
the
middle
district
of
pennsylvania
and
one
to
new
jersey
so
that
we
now
have
cases
being
tried
in
the
district
of
massachusetts,
cases
being
tried
in
the
district
court
in
new
jersey,
cases
being
tried
in
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania
or
a
case
and
matters
too,
and
cases
in
the
united
states
district
court?
this
is
the
discrimination,
which
results
to
frustration,
which
results
from
this
decision
and
the
fragmentizing
and
complete
defeat
of
the
intention
and
purposes
of
the
legislature
in
passing
that
act.
thank
you
your
honor.
