justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
the
--
the
applicable
substantive
law
is
--
is
that
entered
into
the
--
the
matter
of
--
of
justice
in
the
transfer,
the
(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
if
the
--
what
if
there
had
been
decided
before
judge
van
dusen's
decision?
what
if
it
had
been
decided
in
the
pennsylvania
courts
that
pennsylvania
would
follow
the
kilberg
approach
and
then
the
question
of
transfer
came
up,
would
it
be
a
legitimate
consideration
in
judge
van
dusen's
--
dusen's
mind
and
a
way
he
wants,
that
it
depends
for
what
the
massachusetts
--
it
would
be
a
$20,000
limitation
whereas
if
the
case
stated
in
pennsylvania,
there
would
not
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
would've
been
if
--
would
you
say
it
would've
been
--
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
have
been
abuse
of
discretion
if
he
defends
for
it
in
the
face
of
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
can
he
keep
them
from
the
--
from
deciding
the
matter
of
--
in
connection
with
this
transfer
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
he
could've
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
or
judge
van
dusen
didn't
think
so.
i
mean
he
didn't
think
it
was
so
clear
that
that
he
wanted
to
say
what
the
pennsylvania
law
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
maybe
right
but
he
should've
--
shouldn't
have
--
until
he
had
to
say
what
pennsylvania
law
was
but
why
he
shouldn't
he
then
also
not
order
the
transfer?
i
mean
if
he's
going
to
wait
on
the
pennsylvania
law,
maybe
he
had
to
wait
on
ruling
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
if
it's
--
what
if
the
--
it
is
one
of
the
critical
factors
in
ordering
a
transfer,
i
would
think
that
it
might
be
rather
significant
to
decide
the
question
and
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
decide
what
pennsylvania
law
was
but
he
didn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
--
you're
suggesting
that
on
this
transfer
that
the
--
the
pennsylvania
conflict
rule,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there's
no
question
that
that
massachusetts
limitation
will
apply
in
a
trial
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
in
it
--
in
it
and
certainly
massachusetts,
there's
no
question
that
it
will
cover
--
it
will
apply
to
trials
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
had
been
--
if
there
--
if
the
pennsylvania
courts
have
decided
prior
to
the
transferor
that
they
would
adapt
the
kilberg
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that
had
occurred,
judge
van
dusen
transferred
it
at
any
way
and
then
there
was
a
trial
in
massachusetts,
the
$20,000
limitation
would
never
elicit
well.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
pennsylvania
got
to
do
in
that
event?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
no
--
but
no
--
no
condition
and
no
(voice
overlap)
--
limitation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
--
what
you're
saying
if
--
is
that
--
is
that
it
would
be
abusive
discretion
of
transfer
on
the
circumstances.
if
there'd
been
a
pennsylvania
rule
of
this
fact
but
if
the
transfer
occurred
and
it
was
the
same,
the
--
the
massachusetts
court
would
apply
the
massachusetts
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
speaking
for
yourself
and
you're
speaking
for
the
united
states
and
not
some
other
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
any
cases
other
than
this
one
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
would
that
mr.
hollander?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
your
--
your
point
--
you
do
have
two
or
three
points
in
what
you've
said
in
the
--
one
in
--
just
a
--
just
a
--
but
for
reasons
of
economy
of
judicial
manpower,
it
might
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
a
legitimate
consideration
under
1404?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
would
--
you
say
they
would
pick
a
test
case
and
try
it
out
and
the
rest
of
them
would
be
settled?
i
suppose
they
could
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
based
on
that
--
well
why
wouldn't
the
same
thing
happen
if
--
if
the
--
if
the
cases
were
transferred.
some
case
was
bound
to
be
tried
firstly
and
then
--
and
have
a
result.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
a
--
any
--
are
there
any
cases
pending
in
new
york?
justice
byron
r.
white
some
of
them
have
to
be
transferred?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
really
mean
(inaudible)
that
the
same
law
will
apply
aside
from
massachusetts
as
would've
applied
if
it
was
decided
in
pennsylvania,
that's
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
mean
that
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
were
tried
to
pennsylvania,
it
may
be
that
the
massachusetts
law
would
apply.
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
it
would
unless
the
pennsylvania
courts
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
followed
the
new
york
kilberg
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
your
answer
is
not
that
the
law
of
pennsylvania
would
apply
if
itâ€™s
tried
in
massachusetts.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
if
that
is
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
the
answer
is,
you
don't
know
what
law
would
apply
if
it
transferred.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
he
choose
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
guess
(inaudible)
you
could
sue
it
in
a
state
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
that
much
is
forum
--
that's
forum-shopping.
justice
byron
r.
white
condition
of
the
docket?
justice
byron
r.
white
three
or
four
or
five
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
thing
is
that
when
you
choose
the
federal
court,
you
choose
more
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
if
a
--
what
if
the
statute
of
limitations
is
--
in
massachusetts
had
already
run
at
the
time
he
wanted
to
bring
the
suit
in
pennsylvania?
could
you
then
say
it
could
not
have
been
brought
in
massachusetts?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

i
just
want
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
want
to
know
whether
or
not
you
--
if
the
statute
of
limitations
had
run
already
in
massachusetts
in
the
time
you
brought
this
suit,
would
say
that
you
could
have
brought
your
suit
in
massachusetts?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
well,
why
one
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
let's
--
let's
assume
that
pennsylvania's
was
longer
then,
that's
what
i
want
--
that's
what
i
want
to
get
at.
do
you
think
that
you
could
not
have
brought
the
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
conflict
of
law,
i
want
to
know
whether
the
expiration
of
the
statute
of
limitation
means
that
you
can't
bring
the
suit.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
couldn't
win
it
but
could
you
bring
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
in
this
--
so
that
in
such
a
situation
--
in
such
a
situation
on
the
statute
of
limitations
where
it
has
already
expired
in
the
suggested
transferee
district,
a
district
judge
could
not
order
transfer
on
the
condition
the
defendant
would
not
(inaudible)
statute
of

justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
but
they
couldn't
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be
a
problem.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
if
it
--
could've
been
brought
in
the
first
place.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
the
matter
of
capacity
in
massachusetts
is
something
that
--
to
be
--
it
had
to
be
raised.
if
it
isn't
raised
in
a
certain
time
(inaudible)
in
the
case
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
get
you
unqualified?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
that
--
you
mean
they
--
you
mean
they
would
--
they
would
dismiss
the
suit?
they
wouldn't
give
you
14
days
to
qualify?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
for
the
moment
--
justice
byron

white
--
the
rule
they
have
said,
if
this

had
settled
