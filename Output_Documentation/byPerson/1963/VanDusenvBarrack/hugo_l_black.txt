(inaudible)
the
same
law
which
control
(inaudible)
was
tried
in
pennsylvania,
now
what
law
would
that
be?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
just
--
i
don't
want
to
(inaudible)
any
longer
but
what
law,
you
didn't'
--
you
don't
state
what
law,
the
law
of
pennsylvania
or
the
law
of
massachusetts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
which
law
would've
controlled
if
it
--
if
it
go
with
--
to
massachusetts,
the
law
of
massachusetts
or
the
law
of
pennsylvania?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
you
say
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
wasn't
sure
which
position
you
were
taking.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
the
question
involved
in
this
which
was
discussed
in
some
length
(inaudible),
do
you
say
that
the
(inaudible)
whether
a
case
was
tried
in
the
federal
court
in
one
state
or
another
state,
whether
under
the
substantive
laws,
she'll
get
$200,000
or
$20,000?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there
are
10
many
other
cases
that
would
indicate
that
a
case
should
not
be
decided
under
substantive
law.
it
should
not
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
which
court
it
accidentally
got
in.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
for
consideration
that
--
of
the
idea
that
there
might
be
something
else
besides
conflict
of
laws,
formulas
that
had
been
devised,
reconsidered
in
this
and
that
is
whether
you
will
have
a
law,
system
of
law
in
which
the
substantive
rights
of
the
same
parties
vary
as
much
as
you
say
they
would
vary
here
according
to
whether
they
were
tried
in
the
federal
courts
of
one
state
or
the
federal
court
of
another
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
--
to
be
considered,
i
haven't
heard
it
argued.
everything,
the
facts
has
been
talked
about
here
are
the
conflicts
of
law.
erie
and
tompkins
maybe
bad
or
maybe
good,
may
have
been
wrong
in
deciding
on
a
constitutional
basis
and
may
have
been
right,
but
the
constitutional
basis
on
which
it
rested
for
us
by
reason
of
the
accident
to
which
federal
--
to
which
court
the
case
was
be
tried
in,
are
these
substantial
rights
should
not
be
determined
under
--
except
to
general
law
under
different
laws
so
that
people
living
right
across
one
street
from
another
--
from
the
other
might
have
a
--
one
of
them
might
win
and
one
might
lose.
what
you're
arguing
--
what
is
--
one
of
the
things
involved
here,
maybe
it
shouldn't
be
and
maybe
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
it
comes
to
my
mind
every
time
the
suggestion
is
made
that
just
depends
on
which
federal
court
this
is
tried
was
to
how
much
damages
can
be
recovered
under
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you
a
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
state
law
are
these
rights
of
these
parties
to
be
determined?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)--
if
massachusetts
could,
if
the
suit
were
filed
in
massachusetts,
constitutionally
apply
its
law
by
reasons
of
the
contract
so
as
to
render
a
judgment
for
200
--
for
$20,000
only
and
while
pennsylvania
by
reason
of
its
conflict,
could
constitutionally
apply
its
laws
so
as
to
give
$200,000
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
your
answer
i
would
suppose
or
at
least
one
answer
to
the
suggestion
(inaudible)
in
erie
and
thompson.
