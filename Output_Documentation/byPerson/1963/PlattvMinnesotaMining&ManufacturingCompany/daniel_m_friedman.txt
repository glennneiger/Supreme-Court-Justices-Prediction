mr.

m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
presents
problems
involving
the
use
of
the
writ
of
mandamus
to
review
the
denial
of
an
order
entered
under
rule
21
(b)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
refusing
to
transfer
the
venue
of
a
criminal
case.
rule
21
(b)
provides
that
where
a
crime
has
been
committed
in
more
than
one
district,
the
district
court
where
the
indictment
is
filed
upon
the
motion
of
the
defendant
shall
transfer
the
case
to
another
district
where
the
suit
might
have
been
brought
if
the
district
judge
is
satisfied
that
this
transfer
would
be
in
the
interest
of
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
no,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
this
is
a
criminal
case
rule
21
(b).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
that's
not
--
there's
no
--
there's
no
question
in
this
case.
let
me
get
this
out
of
the
way
at
the
beginning,
the
government
conceded
that
this
criminal
action
might
have
been
brought
in
the
district
of
minnesota
to
its
transferor's
request.
there's
no
way
issue
in
this
case
of
that.
question,
it
relates
to
the
action
of
the
district
court
in
refusing
to
transfer.
now
in
this
case,
a
motion
to
transfer
was
scrupulous
filed
in
the
district
court
in
the
eastern
district
of
illinois
where
the
indictment
had
been
returned.
the
district
court
after
full
consideration
denied
the
motion
ruling
that
it
would
be
in
the
interest
of
justice
for
this
case
to
be
tried
in
the
district
there.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
concluded
that
one
of
ten
factors
which
i'll
come
to
in
a
moment
which
the
district
court
had
relied
on
in
denying
the
motion
for
transfer,
was
an
improper
fact.
it
then
undertook
to
review
the
rest
of
the
record
without
this
one
factor,
concluded
that
without
this
one
factor,
this
case
should
be
transferred
to
the
district
of
minnesota
and
issued
a
writ
of
mandamus
directing
the
petitioner
judge
platt
to
transfer
the
case.
there
are
two
basic
issues
in
the
case.
first,
the
propriety
of
the
court
of
appeals
using
the
writ
of
mandamus
at
all
to
review
this
order
and
secondly,
which
is
the
principal
issue
that
we've
argued
in
our
brief,
assuming
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
warranted
in
using
the
writ
in
these
circumstances,
did
the
court
of
appeals
err
when
upon
finding
that
one
of
the
10
factors
relied
upon
was
an
erroneous
one
undertaking
itself,
itself
to
weigh
these
factors
in
concluding
where
the
interest
of
justice
lie.
we
contend
that
in
the
circumstances,
assuming
that
writ
was
properly
used
when
it
found
that
there
had
been
an
improper
factor
relied
on,
it
was
obligatory
on
the
court
of
appeals
to
remand
this
case
to
the
district
court,
to
enable
the
district
judge
to
re-exercise
his
discretion
on
the
basis
of
the
proper
factors.
i
would
like
now
to
turn
to
the
facts
of
the
case
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
asked
it
be
sent
back
to
the
district
court
to
give
him
an
opportunity
to
re-exercise
his
discretion.
and
i
might
--
may
say
that
if
it
sent
back
to
the
district
court,
we
don't
know
without
this
one
factor
whether
he
will
or
will
not
retain
the
case.
he
may
transfer
it.
he
may
retain
it
but
we
think
he
should
be
given
another
opportunity
to
exercise
his
discretion.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
dis
--
the
district
judge
him
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
district
court
judge
said
that
this
was
in
his
response
to
the
rule
of
show
cause,
he
stated
that
this
was
just
one
of
a
number
of
factors.
but
we
still
think
that
the
district
judge
should
have
an
opportunity
without
this
factor
to
reexamine
the
matter
in
con
--
reaches
his
decision.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'm
not
certain
you
--
i'm
not
certain
your
honor,
i
suspect
he
probably
would
but
i
think
he
should
be
given
this
opportunity.
i
like
to
turn
to
the
facts
and
in
my
presentation
of
the
facts
what
i
shall
attempt
to
show
to
the
court
is
basically
that
as
this
matter
came
before
the
district
court,
there
are
arguments
presented
which
admittedly
favored
transfer.
their
arguments
presented
by
the
government
which
militated
against
transfer
and
that
this
is
an
area
where
reasonable
men
might
well
differ
as
to
whether
this
case
should
be
transferred.
we
concede
that.
but
the
--
the
district
court
considered
all
of
these
factors
and
he
concluded
that
on
balance
in
the
exercise
of
his
discretion,
it
should
not
be
transferred.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
--
let
me
say,
explain
that
to
point
mr.
justice.
in
our
petition
for
certiorari,
we
did
not
raise
any
question
with
respect
to
the
propriety
of
the
use
of
the
all
writs
act
here.
but
upon
further
study
of
the
case,
we
concluded
that
there
is
a
really
serious
question
as
to
whether
the
writ
should
be
so
used
in
this
case
and
therefore
we
felt
that
appropriate
to
bring
the
matter
before
the
court
but
in
view
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
--
but
that
--
in
that
case
mr.
justice,
involved
a
--
we
think
a
quite
different
situation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
we
--
we
don't
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
don't
know,
no.
we
don't
question
the
--
the
availability
and
we
don't
question
the
power
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
exercise
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
say,
if
they're
an
abusive
discretion,
they
were
clear
views
of
discretion.
well,
let
me
give
just
as
a
hypothetical
case
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
--
i
think
it
requires
a
great
abuse
of
discretion
for
the
writ
to
be
exercised
properly.
i
think
if
it's
an
--
if
all
that
you
have
is
that
the
reviewing
court
thinks
the
judge
weighed
the
factors
improperly,
i
don't
think
that
is
a
proper
exercise
of
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
exceptional
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
stressed
the
very
limited
function
of
the
writ
of
mandamus
in
this
area.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
--
i
think
so.
in
other
words,
they
deny
--
there,
the
court
had
denied,
he
found
the
parties
--
the
court
held
that
the
district
court
in
effect,
had
denied
the
parties,
plaintiffs
the
right
to
trial
by
the
court
and
remitted
them
to
trial
by
with
a
master.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
--
let
me
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
let
me
put
it
a
little
differently
if
i
may
mr.
justice.
our
point
is
that
mandamus
is
generally
available
but
that
any
error
in
this
case
committed
by
the
district
judge
does
not
seem
to
be
the
kind
of
error
which
is
as
appropriate
to
correct
by
an
extraordinary
writ
at
this
interlocutory
state,
that's
our
point.
our
second
point
is
that
assuming
the
court
of
appeals
properly
entered
into
it
a
disposition
of
the
cases
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
we
--
well,
we--
we
think
the
district
court
--
district
judge
was
right
in
denying
the
writ
but
we're
suggesting
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
at
a
minimum,
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
sent
its
back
to
the
district
judge.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
let
me
just
briefly
state
some
of
these
facts.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
i
perhaps
--
perhaps
i
am,
i
--
i
think
i
don't
know
that
this
court
has
ever
specifically
approved
the
use
of
mandamus
to
review
it,
an
order
of
transfer
but
i
can
conceive
of
situations.
i've
give
--give
your
honor
one,
there
was
a
case
in
the
sixth
circuit
some
years
ago
where
one
district
in
the
circuit
transferred
a
case
to
another
district.
the
other
district
said
that
the
first
district
was
wrong
and
transferred
it
back
again.
then
the
first
district
said
to
the
second
district,
"you
had
no
business
doing
--
instruct
the
case
from
the
docket.
well,
it
seems
to
me
in
that
kind
of
situation
involving
a
transfer
order
there
must
be
some
power
in
the
appellate
court
to
compel
action
there.
then,
the
indictment
in
this
case
was
filed
as
i've
indicated
in
the
city
of
danville
in
the
eastern
district
of
illinois,
it
charged
minnesota
mining
and
i
shall
refer
to
minnesota
mining
here
by
its
colloquial
name
of
3m
with
violating
sections
1
and
2
of
the
sherman
act.
the
indictment
was
in
nine
counts
and
there
were
three
counts
relating
to
each
of
three
principal
products
of
the
company.
in
each
of
these
three
products
that
was
charged
that
minnesota
mining
had
conspired
to
monopolize,
had
attempted
to
monopolize
and
it
conspired
to
restrain
trade.
the
basic
theory
of
the
indictment,
the
whole,
the
unifying
threat
of
the
case
is
that
what
minnesota
mining
had
done
is
had
it
used
its
patents
with
the
threat
of
patent
suits
with
the
actual
bring
of
patent
suits
to
coerce
its
competitors
into
accepting
licenses
from
minnesota
mining
which
contained
various
restrictive
provisions
violative
of
the
sherman
act.
the
--
each
of
these
nine
counts
charged
that
the
offence
committed
has
been
conduct
--
has
been
carried
out
in
part
within
the
eastern
district
of
illinois.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
--
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it's
hard
to
say
mr.
justice.
the
district
court
in
its
opinion
stated
that
without
disclosure
of
the
government's
evidence,
you
just
couldn't
tell
where
the
majority
of
the
patent
negotiations
had
taken
place.
the
government's
--
in
its
affidavit,
the
government
stated
that
--
that
there
were
some
negotiations
at
least
one
that
took
place
within
this
district.
they
alleged
that
a
large
number
of
the
patent
negotiations
did
take
place
in
the
district.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
of
course
one
thing
mr.
justice
is,
what
we
have
here
is
a
nationwide
conspiracy.
this
is
not
just
an
allegation
of
a
particular
accident
localized
in
a
particular
area.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
i
may
try
to
answer
you
--
two
answers
to
that
mr.
justice.
first,
i
suggest
that
the
considerations
which
govern
the
forum
for
the
trial
of
a
major
antitrust
case
maybe
are
somewhat
different
than
those
governed
the
trial
of
a
negligent
--
in
an
accident
case.
secondly,
i
think
that
the
--
as
has
been
suggested
that
it
is
appropriate,
the
government
may
choose
the
forum
which
it
believes
is
the
appropriate
forum
for
bringing
this
case.
now,
we
brought
the
case
in
the
district
court
in
danville.
the
statute
permitted
us
to
bring
the
case
in
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
--
we're
suggesting
the
--
that
it
does
mr.
justice.
but
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
basic
fundamental
distinction
between
these
two
cases.
in
the
preceding
case,
the
district
court
in
the
exercise
of
his
discretion,
judge
van
dusen
concluded
the
transfer
would
be
in
the
interest
of
justice.
in
this
case,
judge
platt
in
the
exercise
of
his
discretion
concluded
the
transfer
would
not
be
in
the
interest
of
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
minnesota
mining
in
support
of
its
motion
to
transfer
filed
nine
affidavits
of
company
officials
and
of
its
lawyers.
and
these
--
these
various
affidavits
set
forth
considerations
which
should
make
it
more
convenient
to
the
company
for
the
case
to
be
tried
in
minnesota
and
would
make
it
less
convenient
to
the
company
for
the
case
to
be
tried
in
danville.
they
pointed
out
that
the
headquarters
were
in
the
eastern
district
of
minnesota
in
saint
paul
that
will
be
easier
for
counsel
during
the
trial
of
this
lengthy
case
to
confer
with
these
officials
in
this
district.
they
pointed
out
that
it
will
be
expense
incurred
in
transferring
the
case
because
of
the
need
to
transport
records,
living
expenses
in
danville,
various
things
and
they
also
mentioned
that
according
to
the
allegations
in
the
indictment
with
they've
been
able
to
determine
with
one
exception,
no
competitor
resided
in
the
eastern
district,
no
coconspirators
resided
in
the
eastern
district
and
that
no
meetings
with
alleged
coconspirators
took
place
there.
finally,
they
stressed
that
there
would
be
no
delay
in
the
trial
if
it
were
transferred
because
they
said
the
docket
in
minnesota
is
current
and
the
average
case
load
for
a
judge
in
the
district
if
minnesota
is
less,
slightly
less
than
the
average
case
load
in
the
eastern
district
of
illinois.
the
government
filed
two
affidavits
in
response,
one
of
which
was
that
of
mr.
jenkinson,
the
head
of
our
midwest
office
in
the
antitrust
division,
the
government's
chief
trial
counsel.
the
affidavit
first
explained
why
this
case
was
brought
in
the
eastern
district
of
illinois,
pointed
out
the
case
had
its
inception
when
a
complaint
was
received
that
had
originated
in
the
eastern
district
of
illinois
in
east
saint
louis
relating
to
one
of
these
three
products
involved
in
this
case.
but
after
a
preliminary
investigation,
the
government
had
been
authorized
to
convene
a
grand
jury
to
investigate
this
particular
product
and
that
--
as
the
investigation
continued
and
the
grand
jury
investigation
lasted
two
years,
complaints
came
in
with
respect
to
two
other
of
these
products
involved
and
therefore
the
grand
jury
having
gone
and
started
the
investigations
expanded
to
cover
all
three
products.
they
also
pointed
out
with
respect
to
the
burdens
which
3m
stated
it
would
have
to
undergo
if
it
was
forced
to
try
the
case
in
danville,
that
this
company
itself,
had
undertaken
in
the
past
to
try
a
very
substantial
numbers
in
35
patent
infringement
cases
in
districts
far
removed
from
its
home
office.
even
though
those
who
are
--
many
of
those
with
cases
in
which
venue
might
have
been
laid
in
the
district
if
minnesota
that
in
the
trial
of
these
cases,
this
company
brought
a
large
number
of
witnesses,
a
large
number
of
records,
a
large
of
attorneys
to
distant
forums.
and
that
indeed,
minnesota
mining
had
participated
in
one-four
weeks
trial
of
one
of
the
patent
cases
involved
in
this
very
suit
in
the
eastern
district
of
illinois.
government
also
answered
the
claim
of
convenience
of
witnesses
pointing
out
that
within
a
300
mile
radius
of
danville
there
were
a
substantial
number
of
the
government's
witnesses
and
that
all
within
a
300
mile
radius
of
saint
paul,
only
one
or
two
minor
government
witnesses
lived.
and
furthermore,
that
a
majority
of
the
government's
key
witnesses
would
find
danville
substantially
more
convenient
than
minnesota.
the
government
also
stated
that
patent
license
negotiations
had
taken
place
in
danville
and
that
a
number
of
residents
of
the
eastern
district
--
i
might
correct
that,
had
taken
place
in
the
eastern
district,
the
patent
of
negotiation
not
in
danville.
and
that
a
number
of
residents
of
that
district
would
be
government
witnesses.
finally,
the
government
stressed
and
we
think
this
is
important
because
one
of
the
grounds
upon
which
judge
platt
relied
into
denying
transfer
was
that
trial
in
danville
would
result
in
trial
a
year
sooner
than
in
the
district
of
minnesota.
that
attempting
to
determine
the
likelihood
of
a
speedy
trial,
on
the
basis
of
testing
the
average
number
of
cases
per
judge
in
each
of
the
district,
was
not
a
fair
gauge
to
judge
platt's
docket.
and
this
was
because
in
the
district
of
minnesota
which
has
one
district,
there
are
four
judges
and
the
cases
are
rotated
among
the
four
judges.
whereas
in
the
eastern
district
of
illinois,
there
are
two
judges,
one
sitting
in
east
saint
louis,
judge
jergens
and
judge
platt
sitting
in
the
other
division
in
danville.
and
most
of
the
327
cases
which
were
pending
in
the
eastern
district
were
pending
before
judge
jergens
and
would
be
tried
before
judge
jergens.
and
the
total
number
of
cases
pending
before
judge
platt
was
a
total
of
109
civil
or
two
--
and
two
criminal
cases
which
this
was
one,
for
a
total
of
a
111
cases
as
against
an
average
of
the
four
judges
in
the
district
of
minnesota
of
170.
and
they
also
pointed
out
information
from
the
clerk
of
the
district
court
in
minnesota
that
the
customary
practice
in
that
district
is
a
criminal
case
with
a
non-natural
defendant
is
put
of
the
end
of
the
calendar.
and
the
clerk's
office
indicated
that
if
this
case
were
transferred
to
the
district
of
minnesota,
it
probably
be
at
least
a
year
until
the
case
could
be
brought
in
trial.
extensive
briefs
were
filed
on
this
motion.
judge
platt
heard
two
days
of
oral
argument
and
the
court
denied
transfer.
the
judge
draws
a
lengthy
memorandum
in
which
he
discussed
separately
10
factors
which
the
defendant
had
urged
as
a
basis
to
transfer.
he
took
each
one
of
them
up.
he
found
that
some
of
them
definitely
favored
transfer
that
others
militated
against
transfer.
he
pointed
out
that
while
it
would
be
convenience
to
the
plaintiff
--
to
the
defendant
if
the
case
were
tried
in
saint
paul.
there
would
also
be
great
convenience
to
the
government
and
he
took
up
each
one
of
these
factors,
found
some
of
them,
pro-transfer
some
of
whom
against
the
factor.
after
discussing
the
nine
factors
which
are
the
--
might
say
the
traditional
criteria
which
courts
have
customarily
looked
to
in
passing
on
transfer
motions,
he
came
to
a
section
called,
special
factors
of
hardship.
and
one
of
the
factors
he
said
was
that
in
view
of
the
position
which
minnesota
mining
had
achieved
in
the
community,
in
view
of
the
substantial
number
of
stockholders
and
employees
who
reside
on
that
district,
it
would
be
more
difficult
to
get
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
in
the
district
of
minnesota
than
in
the
eastern
of
district
of
illinois.
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
we
do
not
--
we
do
not
challenge
that
ruling.
minnesota
mining
sought
a
writ
of
mandamus
from
the
seventh
circuit,
asking
the
court
to
require
the
transfer,
and
it's
stated
in
its
petition
that
in
refusing
to
transfer,
judge
platt
had
denied
it
the
right
trial
in
it's
home
district
namely
as
they
said
--
mainly
on
the
ground
that
the
government
could
not
obtain
a
fair
trial
in
the
district
of
minnesota.
judge
platt
filed
a
personally
signed
response
to
the
rule
to
show
cause
that
it
issued.
and
in
this
response,
he
said
that
that
was
not
the
soul
of
the
main
ground.
he
said
that
there
are
number
of
other
factors
which
also
militated
against
transfer.
and
he
said,
i've
set
them
out
in
my
memorandum,
he
reiterated
them.
he
pointed
out
that
he
had
considered
the
fact
that
the
headquarters
of
this
company
was
in
saint
paul,
as
one
of
the
factors
to
be
evaluated.
but
he
said
he
didn't
find
it
all
controlling.
he
also
indicated
reasons
which
in
his
judgment
suggested
that
the
burdens
upon
3m
in
to
having
to
go
to
danville
would
not
be
as
great
as
they
had
suggested.
a
divided,
a
sharply
divided
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
granted
the
writ.
it
said
that
judge
platt
had
erred
in
considering
this
factor
of
the
government's
difficulty
of
obtaining
an
impartial
jury
in
minneapolis
and
he
said
in
addition,
the
case
was
impressed
with
the
fundamental
historical
right
of
defendant
to
be
prosecuted
in
its
own
environment
or
district.
it
then
itself
undertook
to
review
the
record
and
concluded
that
without
this
single
factor,
the
interest
of
justice
favored
the
transfer.
judge
--
chief
judge
hastings
in
dissent
disagreed
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
both
grounds.
he
thought
that
there
had
not
been
shown
an
abuse
of
discretion
and
certainly
not
such
an
abuse
of
discretion
is
--
warrant
an
extraordinary
writ.
he
also
said
the
majority
had
made
an
unprecedented
procedural
error
in
itself
undertaking
to
balance
the
interest
in
deciding
where
the
interest
of
justice
lie
rather
than
sending
it
back
to
the
district
court.
now,
i'd
like
just
briefly
--
we've
developed
it
in
our
brief
to
advert
to
the
question
of
whether
the
writ
of
mandamus
was
properly
employed
at
all
here.
this
claim
has
frequently
pointed
out
the
limited
office
of
the
writ.
it
is
not
intended
as
a
substitute
for
appeal
that
it
is
limited
to
correcting
a
gross
abuse
of
discretion
to
confining
a
district
court
to
the
exercise
of
its
proper
discretion
or
to
compelling
a
court
to
act
when
action
was
withheld.
and
we
think
that
even
conceding
that
1
of
the
10
factors
should
not
have
been
taken
into
account
by
the
district
judge,
the
mere
lives
in
1
of
10
does
not
rise
to
the
level,
the
kind
of
abuse
which
would
warrant
review
of
this
interlocutory
order
through
the
extraordinary
writ.
now
to
be
sure
there
are
some
basic
distinctions
that
maybe
drawn
between
the
use
of
the
--
the
writ
in
a
criminal
case
to
review
a
transfer
order
and
to
review
--
and
the
use
in
the
civil
case,
the
most
obvious
one
is
that
there
is
no
interlocutory
appeals
act
available
in
a
criminal
case.
on
the
one
hand,
this
perhaps
--
this
does
show
that
there's
no
alternative
remedy
available
by
which
a
litigant
may
test
the
transfer
order.
but
conversely,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
also
suggest
that
and
--
and
underlines
the
strong
policy
to
which
this
court
has
frequently
adverted
and
fairly
recently
in
the
di
bella
case
that
we
should
not
have
piecemeal
appeals
in
criminal
cases.
that
criminal
cases
the
--
the
importance
of
a
speedy
trial
overcomes
the
possibility
that
a
litigant
maybe
forced
to
go
through
a
trial
and
that
an
error
or
--
or
with
a
preliminary
error
which
would
ultimately
infect
the
proceedings
and
be
cause
for
reversal.
now
also,
i
--
i
think
that
i
should
quite
frankly
state
that
it
will
undoubtedly
be
more
difficult
after
conviction
if
there
was
a
conviction
to
review
the
discretionary
action
of
a
district
court
in
denying
transfer,
because
basically
in
these
cases
transfer
is
sought
on
the
theory
that
it's
less
convenient
to
be
tried
in
the
other
forum.
and
once
the
trial
is
over,
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
say
that
the
fact
that
i
was
inconvenienced
is
a
ground
for
reversal.
but
again,
it
seems
to
me,
this
also
cuts
two
ways
that
the
fact
that
it's
unlikely
to
be
prej
--
sufficiently
prejudicial
to
call
for
reversal,
suggests
that
it's
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
should
be
reviewed
on
extraordinary
writ.
the
rule
in
the
case
rule
21
(b),
we
think
makes
it
quite
clear
despite
its
terms
that
this
is
a
matter
for
the
discretion
of
the
district
court.
it
speaks
--
use
--
the
language
it
uses
say
that
should
be
a
transfer
if
the
court
is
satisfied
that
in
the
interest
of
justice,
the
case
should
be
transferred.
the
court
is
satisfied.
it
puts
it
up.
the
district
court
has
to
be
satisfied.
the
interest
of
justice
is
a
very
broad
threat.
it
doesn't
set
out
particularities.
you
don't
decide
whether
a
transfer
was
in
the
interest
of
justice
by
a
mathematical
process
of
adding
up
the
factors
in
favor
and
the
factors
against
and
subtracting
one
from
the
other
and
see
where
the
balance
is.
the
--
the
intangibles
involved
in
making
this
decision
seems
to
us
the
kind
of
thing
that
necessarily
is
committed
to
the
discretion
of
the
district
court.
and
not
surprisingly
not
in
view
of
the
statute,
this
language,
the
revisers,
the
advisory
committee
explicitly
stated
in
describing
this
provision
that
--
it
said
that
after
pointing
out
the
previous
--
to
rule
21
(b),
there
had
no
been
--
been
no
provision
for
transfer
of
venue
in
criminal
cases.
it
stated
the
matter
will
now
be
left
in
the
discretion
of
the
court.
now,
the
defendants
stressed
and
they've
urged
repeatedly
that
basically,
the
reason
judge
platt
was
wrong
here
apart
from
this
single
fact
and
the
reason
why
that
this
court
of
appeals
correctly
directed
transfer
was,
they
say
they
have
a
--
some
historical
right
to
have
a
right
to
be
tried
at
their
own
residence.
and
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
construing
venue
statutes
that
there
is
a
policy
favoring
trial
at
the
residence
of
the
defendant.
but
we
think
when
you're
dealing
with
the
transfer
statute
where
admittedly
the
case
might
have
been
brought
in
any
one
of
the
number
of
venues,
that
the
significance
of
trial
at
the
residence
of
the
defendant
is
no
more
than
a
shorthand
phrase
for
the
various
advantages,
which
will
flow
if
a
defendant
is
tried
where
its
more
convenient
to
him.
in
a
case
of
a
corporation,
admittedly
in
some
cases
there'd
be
very
substantial
advantages
to
being
tried
at
the
home
or
in
other
cases,
there
might
not
be.
if
the
conduct
that
was
challenged
in
the
criminal
case
involve
primarily
the
officials
at
a
branch
office
and
the
records
were
there
i
presume
the
most
convenient
form
would
be
where
that
branch
office
is
located.
but,
we
think
the
important
thing
in
this
is
that
the
district
court
did
consider
under
the
rubric
of
the
interest
of
justice,
all
of
the
factors
which
the
district,
which
the
defendants
relied
on
as
justifying
and
calling
for
transfer
to
their
home
forum
and
found
that
these
advantages
were
outweighed
and
were
not
--
that
the
defendants
had
not
shown,
had
not
made
the
showing
that
the
transfer
would
be
in
the
interest
of
justice.
we
think
it
clear
that
mandamus
cannot
be
used
to
tell
the
district
court
how
to
exercise
its
discretions
but
only
to
require
the
district
court
to
conduct
itself
and
exercise
the
discretion
in
accordance
with
the
proper
standards.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
a
delaware
corporation
with
its
principal
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman

i
--
i
suppose
so.
it's
--
but
--
but
its
main
office
concededly
as
in
saint
paul.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
as
i
indicated
mr.
--
mr.
justice,
the
reason
is
that
the
invest
--
a
com
--
the
case
originated
from
a
complaint
that
was
received
from
the
eastern
district
of
illinois
that
the
invest
the
grand
jury
was
convened
in
that
district
which
is
not
an
unusual
practice
in
antitrust
cases
and
that
was
where
the
case
developed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
just
like
to
say
briefly
in
few
seconds
i
have
left
that
it
may
well
be
that
if
any
members
of
this
court
were
sitting
from
the
district
court
in
this
case,
mr.
chadwell's
argument
would've
been
persuasive
to
them.
but
we
think
that
contrary
to
what
mr.
chadwell
has
said
here
that
there
were
factors
which
the
district
court
reverted
to,
reverted
to.
and
i
might
just
mention
here
that
one
of
the
things
district
court
said
in
the
end
of
his
memorandum
was
he
said
some
facts
mentioned
by
counsel
have
not
been
noted
in
order
to
like
not
to
lengthen
this
memorandum.
and
we
think
there's
no
doubt
in
our
mind
that
when
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
did
what
it
did,
it
was
basically
substituting
it's
discretion
from
the
district
court.
and
it
think
the
clearest
demonstration
of
that
is
the
statement
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
next
to
the
last
paragraph
of
it's
opinion
in
page
248
in
--
after
the
stating
the
things
with
mr.
chadwell
stated
says
consequently.
we
are
convinced
that
this
multiple
venue
criminal
prosecution
should
be
tried
in
the
district
of
minnesota
which
is
the
home
of
petitioner.
but
the
rule
says,
the
rule
says
that
it
should
be
transferred
only
if
the
district
court
is
satisfied
that
it's
in
the
interest
of
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
he
stated
--
i
--
i
can
perhaps
put
it
most
effectively
if
i
might
read
to
the
court
what
judge
platt
himself
stated
in
his
response
to
the
rule
to
show
cause
in
which
he
said
that
he
had
given,
this
is
at
page
236
of
the
record,
he
said
that
he
gave
consideration
to
all
the
factors
and
found
several
which
militated
against
transfer.
the
first
fact
he
said
that
the
trial
of
this
case
would
be
delayed
at
least
a
year
if
it
were
transferred
and
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
appeared
to
respondent
that
the
trial
of
the
case
would
be
delayed
at
least
a
year
by
the
transfer
and
the
government
avowed
a
speedy
trial
was
essential
because
some
of
the
petitioners,
competitors
are
in
financial
straights
owing
to
petitioner's
alleged
conduct
and
to
the
fact
that
petitioner
has
refused
to
hold
it's
allegedly
illegal
activities.
that's
the
first
one.
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
at
page
236,
the
paragraph
numbered
6.
the
first
one
is
that
transfer
of
the
case
would
delay
at
least
for
a
year
and
that
a
speedy
trial
was
important
because
the
defendant
has
allegedly
continuing
this
illegal
activity.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
he
--
i
assumed
he
did
not
stated
in
so
many
word
but
i
assume
the
reason
for
he
said
in
his
previous
opinion
would
delay
and
i
take
it
that
is
because
of
the
fact
that
he
had
a
much
smaller
dockets
than
the
average
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice,
that
will
be
set
forth.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
the
disagreement
between
us
is
as
to
whether
they
said
there
would
not
be
any
delay
because
they
say
that
you
average
as
between
all
the
judges
in
the
district
of
minnesota
and
all
the
two
judges
in
the
eastern
district
of
illinois.
we
say
the
proper
standard
for
determining
how
soon
you
would
have
a
trial
before
judge
platt
is
what
the
state
of
judge
platt's
docket
wasn't
the
state
of
judge
platt's
docket
was
much
better
than
that
of
the
average
docket
in
the
district
of
minnesota.
now,
the
second
point
--
that
was
the
first
point,
the
second
point
judge
platt
made
was
that
the
government
witnesses
maybe
inconvenience
if
forced
to
travel
to
the
northern
city
of
st.
paul,
minnesota.
that's
two
items.
the
third
one,
that
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
is.
just
the
affidavit
of
mr.
jenkinson
to
which
i've
referred,
which
states
at
page
89
that
although
the
government
would
not
reveal
an
advance
of
trial
the
names
of
its
witnesses,
it
states
that
a
substantial
number
of
the
government's
witnesses
live
within
a
300-mile
radius
of
danville
whereas
only
one
or
two
of
it's
presently
contemplated
witnesses
live
within
300
miles
of
st.
paul,
they
are
minor
witnesses
and
that
danville
is
substantially
closer
and
more
convenient
for
the
majority
of
the
government's
key
witnesses.
mr.

no,
there
is
no
reference
to
the
number.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
about
it
think
350
miles,
roughly.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
then
he
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
government's
documents
are
already
in
danville
in
the
custody
of
the
court.
fourth,
and
would
have
to
be
transferred
to
st.
paul.
then
he
stated
the
transfer
would
increase
the
government's
expenses
because
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
he
had
said,
yes,
in
his
earlier
opinion,
he
had
recognized
that
it
would
a
burden
on
the
company
to
have
to
transfer
its
records
from
st.
paul
to
danville.
he
pointed
out
that
a
number
of
these
records
were
already
in
the
custody
of
counsel
in
chicago
but
he
recognized
that
there
would
be
an
additional
burden.
he
is
just
at
this
point.
at
this
point,
he
is
explaining
in
response
to
the
claim
that
the
difficulties
of
obtaining
the
unfair
trial
where
the
principal
basis
for
his
decision,
the
other
factors
he
relied
on.
the
point
then
in
the
next
one
is
a
transfer
to
increase
the
government's
expenses
because
its
witness
fees
would
be
greater.
in
other
words,
the
government
has
to
pay
witness
fees,
mileage
witness
fees
and
they
would
be
greater
as
what
its
cost
to
transportation
of
the
government's
staff
and
then
finally
it
would
be
more
difficult
for
the
government
to
get
an
impartial
jury
in
st.
paul
than
in
danville.
and
then
over
in
page
237
in
paragraph
(7),
he
pointed
out
to
other
factors
which
suggest
the
burden
on
minnesota
mining
would
not
be
as
great
as
they
have
suggested
since
a
lot
of
this
material
deals
with
rather
ancient
history
would
not
be
present
any
serious
burden
on
the
company
to
have
to
take
away
from
it's
home
office,
old
records
which
were
not
needed
for
current
things.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
--
the
allegations
are
basically
misuse
of
patents
that
they
use
their
patents
--
they
--
they
had
these
critical
patents
and
that
under
the
threat
of
actual
of
threatened
patent
litigation,
they
coerced
competitors
into
accepting
licenses
with
a
restricted
provision.
