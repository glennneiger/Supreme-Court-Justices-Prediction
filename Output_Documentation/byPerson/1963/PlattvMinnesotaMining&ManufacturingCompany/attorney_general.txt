mr.
mr.
attorney
general
i
would
just
like
to
point
out,
if
your
honors
please.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
and
i
appreciate
your
suggestion.
that
the
--
the
first
statement
delayed
at
least
a
year
is
not
supported
by
the
record.
he
just
--
even
the
court
said
that,
no
doubt
in
good
faith
thinking
that
would
be
true.
i
don't
question
that
at
all.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
your
honor.
then
he
went
on
and
accept
--
accepted
as
true,
denying
us
the
presumption
of
innocence
that
a
speedier
trial
in
that
was
needed
because
of
--
because
of
avowal
of
the
government
that
we're
continuing
these
patent
activities
which
are
under
attack.
this
second
point,
the
government's
witnesses
maybe
inconvenienced,
i've
already
dealt
with
it.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
third
point
on
the
documents
i
have,
and
the
transfer
would
increase
the
government's
expenses,
my
answer
to
that
is
that
--
that
is
of
no
significance
and
as
--because
of
the
home
district
point
and
because
of
the
facts
found
without
contradiction
to
which
i
refer
to
my
arguments,
i
think
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
i
beg
your
pardon--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
your
honor,
there
were
two
statements
in
the
record
on
that
and
that's
all.
and
if
i'm
not
correct
on
this,
i
would
like
mr.
mcgee
to
--
to
correct
me.
one
was
that
there
are
two
letters
written
that
deal
with
sales
or
purchases
of
the
products
involved
in
the
indictment
in
the
eastern
district
of
illinois.
of
course,
there
were
hundreds
of
thousands
of
sales
of
these
products
of
all
over
the
united
states.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
but
that
i
--
we
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
no
question
but
the
business
we
do
in
this
district
is
minimal.
and
it
--
it
may
give
venue,
as
i
argue
to
you
--
to
the
court.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
because
it
is
--
it
is
nothing
com
--
excuse
me,
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
the
court.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
it's
minimal
compared
to
the
home
district
to
which
we
are
--
to
which
we
move
the
transfer
of
the
case.
that
is
where
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir,
and
in
terms
of
witnesses,
in
terms
of
convenience
of
trial.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
we
sell
--
we
sell
tape.
we
sell
tape
all
over
the
united
states.
and
the
--
the
tape
that
it's
in
--
that
we
do
sell
all
over
the
united
states
is
sold
in
danville
as
well
as
st.paul,
new
york,
washington
and
everywhere
else.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
i
haven't
the
slightest
idea,
your
honor.
i
--
i
will
say
that
i
have
frequently
wondered
why
they
bring
suits
where
--
where
they
do.
in
this
case,
i
don't
know
why.
i
have
no
idea
why.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
they
won
--
they
won
several
down
there
and
i
think
that
maybe
a
reason
why
although
i
don't
want
to
state
that
as
--
as
my
view
necessarily.
the
a&p
case
i
might
say
was
in
danville.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
the
general
motors
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
judge
lindley
is
not
there
any
longer.
that
--
that
trial
was
in
danville.
there
have
been
some
other
cases
in
danville.
that's
the
only
protracted
antitrust
case
tried
in
danville
so
far
as
i
know.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
sir,
he's
the
only
one
in
danville.
there
are
two
judges
in
the
eastern
district.
judge
jergens
is
in
east
st.
louis
and
judge
platt
is
in
danville.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
has
he
tried
any?
he
has
not
tried
any
contested
antitrust
cases
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
he
has
had
a
number
of
antitrust
cases
in
which
there'd
been
settlements.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
sir,
that
was
tried
in
--
in
st.
louis.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
oh,
yes,
he's
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
to
--
to
minnesota
--
st.
paul,
minnesota
which
is
the
home
district
of
the
defendant.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
four,
yes,
sir.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
how
large
is
the
district?
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
the
whole
state,
yes,
sir.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
they
--
they
hold
court
in
various
places,
yes,
sir.
the
--
they
hold
court,
both
in
st.
paul
and
in
minneapolis
and
in
other
areas
in
the
state.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
it's
--
it's
distributed
around
among
the
judges,
the
cases
are
and
i
might
say
to
the
court
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
oh,
no,
no,
no,
and
--
and
i
might
--
and
--and
that
wasn't
the
reason
that
were
--
we've
made
a
motion
to
transfer.
no,
no,
we
don't
know
and
the
--
and
the
fact
is
that
the
jury
can
be
drawn
from
all
over
the
state
for
any
one
of
the
areas.
although
generally
speaking,
it's
gone
from
the
general
proximity
of
(inaudible)
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
i
--
i
believe
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
believe
it
is.
they
hold
court
in
other
areas
in
the
state
and
i'm
not
too
sure
about
--
about
that.
i
must
say
that
i
perhaps
not
given
the
court
exact
information
on
that.
