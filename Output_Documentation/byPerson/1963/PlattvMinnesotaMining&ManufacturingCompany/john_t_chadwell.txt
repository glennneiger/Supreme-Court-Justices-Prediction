mr.
john
t.
chadwell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit
issued
its
writ
of
mandamus
in
this
case,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
cause
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
record
facts
show
a
clear
abuse
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
district
court
in
denying
our
motion
to
transfer
this
complex
antitrust
case
from
danville
where
the
government
chose
to
bring
the
case
to
st.
paul.
from
danville,
where
the
defendant
has
no
office,
plant,
facility
or
employee,
to
minnesota,
where
it
has
its
main
office,
all
employees,
officers
or
directors
who
know
anything
about
this,
the
issues
in
this
case,
where
the
government
has
not
alleged
or
stated
in
a
single
affidavit,
contrary
to
what
mr.
friedman
inadvertently
stated,
that
a
single
witness,
a
single
witness
resides
within
the
district
--
eastern
district
of
illinois.
the
court
of
appeals
made
its
decision
upon
three
--
that
the
court
had
--
had
clearly
abused
its
discretion
on
the
basis
of
three
primary
considerations.
the
first
of
which,
as
i
understood
mr.
freedman
today,
he
admits
to
have
been
improper.
the
first
was
that
it
was
unlikely
that
the
government
could
secure
a
fair
trial
in
minnesota
and
admitted
that
that
was
an
improper
factor.
that
was
one
reason
that
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
the
district
court
has
abused
its
discretion.
the
second
reason
was
that
the
denial
of
transfer
was
ordered
despite
the
public
policy
sometimes
referred
to
or
referred
to
in
the
johnson
case
as
the
constitutional
concern
of
the
courts
for
try
out
of
a
criminal
case
in
the
home
district
of
the
defendant
in
the
absence
of
strong
reasons
to
the
contrary.
and
the
third
reason
why
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
this
was
a
clear
abuse
of
discretion
was
that
there
was
every
reason
for
a
trial
in
the
home
district
of
the
defendant,
st.
paul,
minnesota
or
the
district
of
minnesota,
add
no
substantial
reason
for
a
trial
in
the
eastern
district
of
illinois.
now,
why
the
government
chose
to
present
this
matter
to
a
grand
jury
in
the
eastern
district
of
illinois
in
danville
some
130
miles
or
so
south
of
chicago,
why
they
did
it?
we
don't
know.
we
know
the
explanation
they
gave,
this
we
do
know.
they
did
it
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
had
to
come
to
st.
paul
over
a
period
of
something
like
17
years
intermittently.
this
investigation
started
back
in
1945.
it
was
quite
active
for
a
number
of
years
then
there
was
a
period
when
it
wasn't
and
then
it
was
resumed
and
there
--
there,
it
went
on
for
a
long
period
of
time.
they
spent
weeks
and
months
in
the
offices
of
the
company
at
st.
paul.
they
knew
all
about
the
fact
that
st.
paul
was
the
situs
of
this
whole
thing,
yet
they
choose
to
proceed
in
danville.
i
say
i
don't
know
why
they
did,
they
did.
we
don't
have
to
show
that
they
shouldn't
have
proceeded
in
danville.
all
we
have
to
show
under
rule
21
(b)
is
that
we
come
within
that
rule
after
the
indictment
was
return.
and
on
that,
if
your
honors
please,
i
would
like
to
make
a
brief
statement
about
the
provisions
and
purposes
of
rule
21
(b).
rule
21
(b)
differs
from
section
1404
(a)
which
this
court
has
--
had
before
it
in
the
preceding
case.
in
that
it,
of
course,
that
is
rule
21
(b),
is
a
rule
of
this
court
under
the
criminal
rules
of
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
this
section
1404
(a),
of
course,
is
a
statute.
it
has
also
one
additional
significant,
a
difference
in
phraseology,
i
would
submit
and
that
is
that
rule
1404
(a)
is
permissive.
it
says
the
court
may
transfer,
may
transfer
where
the
--
where
the
circumstances
come
within
the
provisions
of
the
rule.
in
rule
--
in
this
statute,
in
rule
21
(b),
the
provision
is
that
the
court
shall
transfer
where
it
appears
that
in
the
interest
of
justice,
a
transfer
should
be
made
to
another
district
in
which
a
venue
lies.
now,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
court
is
vested
with
discretion
of
course
in
passing
upon
a
motion
of
this
kind
and
is
entitled
to
way,
what
is
said
by
the
moving
party
in
this
case,
minnesota
mining,
as
against
what
it
said
by
the
government,
by
a
way
of
bill
of
particulars,
allegations
of
the
indictment
or
affidavits.
but,
if
the
trial
court,
passing
on
this
motion,
is
unable
to
make
a
finding
as
to
a
single
substantial
reason
why
the
case
should
not
be
transferred,
then
it
is
clearly
a
case
of
abuse
of
discretion
and
one
which
the
court
of
appeals
properly
should've
issued
as
it
did,
their
writ
of
mandamus.
now
on
that
point,
i
would
like
to
state
that
the
basic
purpose
of
this
rule,
which
has
been
recognized
in
a
number
of
lower
court
decisions,
this
being
the
first
time
the
case
involving
the
rule
directly
has
been
before
your
honors,
the
basic
purpose
of
this
rule
has
been
to
reach
this
precise
sort
of
a
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
judge
holtzoff,
who
was
secretary
of
the
advisory
committee,
and
judge
medallia,
who
was
a
member
of
the
advisory
committee,
each
have
made
statements,
which
are
referred
to
in
our
brief
on
the
different
seminars
and
so
on
shortly
after
the
rules
were
adopted
in
which
they
stated
that
one
of
the
principle
reasons
that
the
advisory
committee
recommended
rule
21
(b)
to
the
supreme
court
was
because
of
the
practice
followed.
in
the
past,
in
the
antitrust
division
of
the
united
states
department
of
justice
in
bringing
criminal
antitrust
cases
away
from
the
home
district
of
the
defendant.
that's
exactly
what
these
two
judges,
who
were
members
of
the
committee,
said
and
that
is
what
the
lower
courts
have
recognized
to
have
been
a
basic
purpose
of
this
rule
when
the
supreme
court
adopted
it.
now,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
if
your
honor
please
--
your
honors
please,
we
do
not
argue
that
the
defendant
has
an
absolute
right.
we
do
not
argue
that
the
defendant
has
an
absolute
right
to
transfer
to
its
home
district.
we
do
argue
that
that
right
of
trial
in
the
home
district
is
recognized
in
rule
21
(b)
was
a
reason
why
it
was
adopted
and
that
in
the
absence
of
reasons
to
the
contrary,
substantial
reasons
to
the
contrary,
transfers
should
take
place,
should
be
ordered.
and
i
--
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
this
fact
that
until
judge
platt
denied
transfer
in
this
criminal
case,
not
a
single
district
court
and
not
a
single
court
of
appeals
had
refused
to
transfer
a
criminal
antitrust
case
to
the
home
district
of
the
defendant
or
to
a
branch
office
of
the
defendant
if
the
facts
took
place
there
rather
than
in
the
home
district
on
motion
of
the
defendant.
the
latter
sort
of
a
situation,
the
home
--
the
--
the
branch
office
residence
or
situs
of
the
defendant
--
of
a
defendant
is
the
general
motors
case,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
and
i
might
say
to
your
honors
that
we
collect
the
cases
on
page
39
to
40
in
our
brief.
those
cases
bear
out
what
i'm
just
saying
to
the
court.
now
in
the
general
motors
case,
we
had
a
situation
that
would've
been
similar
to
what
we
would've
had
here
if
at
--
if
at
danville,
there'd
been
a
branch
office
of
minnesota
mining,
let
us
say
and
if
the
activities
of
the
defendant
related
to
that
branch
office.
in
general
motors,
the
locomotive
case,
electromotive
case
was
brought
against
--
was
brought
against
them
in
--
in
new
york,
indictment
was
there.
a
move
to
transfer
to
chicago
and
not
detroit
because
in
chicago,
the
locomotive
division
had
its
headquarters,
the
books
and
records
were
there,
the
witnesses
were
there
and
that
in
the
interest
of
justice,
it
was
contended
and
held
by
the
district
court,
should
be
the
place
of
trial.
that
was
where
it
was
removed
to.
now
here,
if
danville
had
been
an
area
where
there
was
a
--
an
important
branch
office
or
a
branch
office
of
this
company
or
the
activities
had
substantially
taking
place
there,
a
great
many
of
the
witnesses
were
there,
then
of
course,
danville
would've
been
a
proper
situs
for
the
trial
of
this
case.
but
as
i
said,
there's
not
a
thing
that
connects
this
company
with
--with
danville
except,
except
that
the
defendant
--
that
the
government
claims
that
in
danville,
they
can
prove
venue.
and
venue
they
set
forth
in
here
as
the
most
minimal
amount
and
as
your
honors
know,
it
is
not
required
to
show
very
much
in
order
to
prove
venue.
well,
assuming
that
they
can
prove
venue,
that
is
when
rule
21
comes
into
play.
it's
admitted
for
the
purposes
of
this
motion
that
venue
was
properly
laid
in
danville,
that
gives
them
no
right
to
keep
it
there,
that
would
be
exercising
the
right
to
an
absolute
choice
of
forum
which
is
the
right
that
the
government
had
prior
to
the
adoption
of
rule
21
(b).
if
an
indictment
came
down
in
a
certain
district
and
if
venue
lay
there,
there's
nothing
that
could
be
done
about
it.
now,
the
court
has
recognized
the
injustices
stated
by
judge
medallia,
a
member
of
the
advisory
committee,
that
existed
prior
to
the
adoption
of
rule
21
(b)
and
has
said
that
under
these
circumstances
where
it
is
in
the
interest
of
justice,
a
criminal
case
shall
be
transferred,
shall
be
transferred
to
another
district
where
venue
lies.
and
i
--
i
urge
to
the
court
that
the
facts
here
support
the
court
of
appeals
completely
and
that
there's
no
substantial
reason
why
the
case
should've
been
kept
in
danville.
and
with
the
court's
permission,
i
should
like
to
review
therefore
the
factual
considerations,
which
caused
me,
if
your
honors
please,
to
make
that
statement.
the
first
is
this.
i've
already
said
it.
the
home
office,
research
laboratories,
number
of
these
manufacturing
plants,
all
its
records
are
in
st.
paul.
no
office,
plant,
branch
or
employee
in
the
eastern
district
of
illinois.
all
officers
in
the
company
live
in
st.
paul
or
near
st.
paul,
none
in
the
eastern
district
of
illinois.
the
defendant's
uncontradicted
affidavits
show
that
all
officers
and
employees
of
the
company,
called
before
the
grand
jury
during
the
extensive
period
of
this
investigation,
came
from
st.
paul
except
one
man
who
had
retired
and
had
previously
lived
in
st.
paul
and
was
then
living
in
california.
everyone
that
the
--
the
fact
is
that
the
defendant
has
shown
by
affidavit
that
other
witnesses
known
to
the
defendant,
they
were
able
to
determine
from
appearances
before
the
grand
jury
and
the
like,
24
of
the
employees
of
alleged
co-conspirators
come
from
the
east
coast
to
which
east
coast
or
chicago
not
a
one
from
danville
or
in
st.
paul.
they
come
from
the
east
coast,
chicago
or
st.
paul,
none
from
the
danville
area.
the
--
the
district
court
did
say
that
obviously,
if
your
honors
will
read
his
opinion,
that
obviously,
st.
paul
would
be
more
convenient
for
the
defense
witnesses
than
danville
and
made
that
finding
which
of
course
was
obvious.
but
he
said
as
to
the
government
witnesses,
and
i
quote,
“the
question
of
convenience
is
not
so
easily
determined.”
now,
he
hadn't
make
a
single
finding,
as
indeed
he
could
not,
that
it
would
be
more
convenient
for
the
government
witnesses.
he
merely
said
it's
not
easy
to
determine
it.
and
the
reason
it
wasn't
easy
to
determine
it
was
because
that
the
government
refused
to
give
him
any
information
from
which
he
could
make
the
determination
except
the
general
affidavit
that
they
had
a
substantial
number
of
witnesses
who
were
within
the
300-mile
radius
of
the
east
district
of
illinois,
didn't
say
within
the
east
district
of
illinois,
within
300
miles
and
they
would
be
inconvenience
by
going
to
st.
paul
rather
than
danville
where
the
300
--
that's
the
conclusion
of
the
find.
in
fact,
the
matter
is
that
300
miles
in
danville
include
chicago,
and
our
affidavit
show
that
it
is
much
easier
to
get
from
chicago
to
st.
paul
as
it
--
than
from
chicago
to
danville.
the
error
time
on
jets
to
st.
paul
is
about
the
same
as
the
airtime
from
chicago
to
--
to
danville
approximately
an
hour
in
each
instance.
and
then
the
frequency
of
the
flights
are
much
greater
in
the
instance
in
the
case
of
chicago
to
st.
paul
than
from
chicago
to
danville.
now,
i
say
that
the
government
has
a
right
to
refuse
to
give
any
information
on
the
facts
in
--
in
contesting
one
of
these
motions.
but
one
of
the
consequences
of
their
failure
to
do
so,
i
respectively
submit,
is
that
they're
going
to
lose
the
motion
because
if
they're
unwilling
to
give
any
facts
even
without
naming
witnesses
their
location,
how
can
they
expect
the
court
to
make
any
finding?
court
can't
make
any
finding
and
indeed
judge
platt
didn't
on
that
point
which
found
that
it's
not
so
easy
to
determine
the
convenience
of
the
government
witnesses.
well,
assuming
that
the
convenience
of
the
government
witnesses
should
override
the
convenience
of
the
defense,
and
i
say
in
a
criminal
case
that
should
not
be
the
case,
there
is
no
finding
against
us
on
that
point
whatsoever.
and
i
say
that
even
though
--
there
--
it
would
be
convenient
for
a
number
of
the
government
witnesses
to
go
st.
--
to
go
to
danville
rather
than
st.
paul,
that
fact
should
not
weigh
a
penny
weight
unless
it's
an
overwhelming
showing
in
view
of
the
very
strong
showing
that
we
have
made
here
as
to
the
convenience
of
our
witnesses.
we
have
shown
by
uncontradicted
affidavits
that
the
cost
to
us
for
trying
this
case
in
--
in
danville
above
the
cost
of
try
--
for
trying
the
case
in
minnesota
would
be
over
$100,000.
no
dispute
on
that
whatsoever
and
it
is
perfectly
obvious.
that's
a
minimum
figure
i
might
say
that
we
gave
in
the
--
in
the
affidavit.
and
another
point
that
we
make
which
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
in
the
opinion
that
it's
obvious,
of
course,
to
--
to
the
justices
of
this
court,
is
that
in
defending
a
complex
criminal
case
of
this
kind.
and
as
a
reason
for
the
home
district
rule,
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
for
trial
counsel
to
have
constant
immediate
access
to
--
to
officials,
employees
and
--
and
records
of
the
defendant
company.
now,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
far
more
important
in
a
criminal
case
than
in
a
civil
case.
we
have
tried,
of
course,
those
of
us
involved
in
--
in
a
good
deal
of
antitrust
litigation,
have
tried
a
great
many
civil
cases
away
from
the
home
of
the
home
office
of
the
defendant.
where
do
you
have
pretrial
discovery,
you're
able
to
get
the
records
of
the
government
or
the
opponent,
you're
able
to
find
out
about
the
witnesses,
you
can
take
depositions.
and
when
the
trial
starts,
you're
pretty
well
set
and
you
know
what
employees
or
officers
of
the
defendant
company
should
be
at
the
situs
of
the
trial,
you
know
that
from
your
pre-trial
discovery.
there
is
no
pretrial
discovery
in
this
criminal
cases,
is
a
strong
reason
for
the
applicability
of
rule
21
(b)
here.
i
submit
to
your
honors,
if
we
had
to
try
this
complex
case
in
danville,
which
our
record
--
which
our
affidavit
show
will
take
four
or
five
or
six
months
to
try,
it's
a
matter
involving
the
three
separate
product
lines
of
this
company,
very
important
product
lines.
they're
claiming
that
we
filed
44
patent
suits
or
defendant
44
patent
suits
over
a
period
of
25
years
and
our
good
faith
in
our
patent
activities
is
at
issue.
if
we
had
to
try
this
case
in
danville,
we
would
not
have
the
slightest
idea
in
advance
of
trial
just
who
we
ought
to
have
down
there
and
who
we
shouldn't.
it
could
very
well
be.
we
don't
know
the
names
of
these
witnesses.
we
don't
know
what
the
government's
going
to
say.
we're
not
permitted
to
have
pretrial
discovery.
it
could
very
well
be.but
we
get
into
court,
we
start
the
trial
of
this
case,
they
will
call
to
the
stand
some
witness
that
i
had
never
heard
of.
and
how
do
i
find
out
why
i
go
to
the
--
to
the
people
in
the
minnesota
mining
who
has
had
to
do
with
that
transaction
to
find
out?
and
i
--
and
i
find
that
they
we're
--
he's
up
in
st.
paul,
we
didn't
know
we're
going
to
need
him
down
here
in
danville,
so
we
didn't
bring
him
down.
now,
what
about
the
record?
well,
they're
up
in
st.
paul.
now,
that's
undenied.
there's
no
question
what
i'm
stating
to
the
court
from
beginning
to
end
here
is
undenied
in
the
record
in
this
case.
is
it
--
is
it
in
the
interest
of
justice
under
rule
21
(b)?
is
it
within
the
discretion
of
a
trial
court?
were
these
facts
are
admitted,
conceded,
undenied?
that
the
trial
court
should
say,
“oh,
well,
maybe
you
can't
defend
this
case
as
well
in
danville",
but
the
government
says,
as
the
trial
court
said
here,
that
they've
got
some
records
in
st.
paul
and
they'd
have
to
send
him
up
to
minneapolis.
well,
i'll
tell
you
what
records
they've
got
in
st.
paul.
they've
got
some
records
that
they
subpoenaed
from
various
people
in
this
case.
mr.
john
t.
chadwell
i
said
dan
--
i'm
sorry.
in
--
in
danville,
they
have
some
records
that
they
subpoenaed
from
various
witnesses
who
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
and
according
to
the
size
and
weight
of
the
boxes
that
they
describe,
it
had
cost
$50
for
them
to
send
these
records
from
--
from
danville
up
to
st.
paul.
the
--
the
court,
the
district
court
took
note,
took
note
of
our
contention,
which
i
am
making
to
your
honors
here,
that
we
need
a
constant
access
to
the
record
in
the
people
in
minnesota
mining
to
defend
this
complex
criminal
case
where
we
had
no
discovery
prior
to
trial.
he
--
he
recognized
that
but
he
said
in
view
of
the
size
of
the
defendant
that
should
not
make
too
much
difference.
well,
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
--
in
dealing
with
that
subject,
if
your
honors
please,
it
does
make
a
difference.
and
i
would
like
to
read
to
the
court
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
facts,
the
facts
of
this
case
aside
from
the
concededly
improper
factor,
namely,
the
fair
trial
in
minnesota
issue,
concededly
an
improper.
aside
from
that,
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
substantial
reason
to
hold
this
case
in
danville
and
here
is
what
the
court
said
and
i
am
reading
from
--
from
page
248
of
the
record,
if
your
honors
please.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“in
the
case
at
bar,
in
addition
to
the
demonstration,
by
proof
or
admission
of
the
essential
elements
of
convenience,
expense
and
early
trial
constituting
the
interest
of
justice
in
the
civil
case,
this
criminal
case
is
impressed
with
the
fundamental
historical
right
of
a
defendant
to
be
prosecuted
in
his
own
environment
or
district."
now,
the
--
the
facts
which
are
--
which
are
admitted
or
undenied
is
in
footnote
3
here
and
they
are
as
follows.
a
trial
in
the
eastern
district
of
illinois
would
result
on
unjustifiable
increased
expenses
to
petitioner
of
at
least
$100,000,
undenied,
undenied
in
the
record,
great
inconvenience
of
witnesses.
i've
stated
the
facts
on
that
to
the
court.
serious
disruption
of
business,
there
be
any
question
about
that.
we
have
the
transfer
records
and
witnesses
and
--
and
executives
and
employees
all
--
from
danville
to
st.
paul
for
this
protracted
trial.
interferes
of
contact
between
petitioners,
executives,
and
as
trial
attorneys
in
connection
with
protract
and
antitrust
prosecution
trial,
that's
the
point
which
i've
just
argued
to
the
court.
there
is
no
dispute
on
a
single
one
of
these
factors
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
from
this
record
then
he
--
then
they
go
on.
petitioner
has
no
office,
plant
or
other
facility
in
the
eastern
district
of
illinois.
well,
that
of
course
is
undenied.
there's
no
serious
congestion
of
the
docket
of
the
district
court
of
minnesota.
and
while
a
division
of
the
case
is
pending
in
the
eastern
district
of
illinois
between
the
two
judges
of
that
district,
would've
reveal
a
considerable
case
load
for
both
of
them.
the
fact
is
the
dockets
are
current
in
both
districts
and
--
but
judge
--
judge
platt
did
say
that
he
thought
the
trial
in
st.
paul
would
take
a
year
--
the
case
would
take
year
longer
to
come
to
trial
in
st.
paul
than
in
danville.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
a
year
for
the
preparation
of
a
trial
of
this
magnitude
is
--
is
not,
in
any
way,
unreasonable.
and
when
the
dockets
are
current,
as
the
court
of
appeals
found
them
to
be,
it
makes
no
difference.
now,
those
are
the
facts
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
trial
court
had
abused
his
discretion
aside
from
the
concededly
improper
factor,
had
abused
his
discretion
in
--
in
or
denying
the
transfer
of
this
case.
now,
the
government's
real
point,
the
government's
real
point
here
is,
well,
he
--
maybe
the
trial
court
made
a
--
was
guilty
of
abuse
of
discretion,
maybe
was.
but
and
--
and
perhaps,
perhaps
mandamus
is
a
proper
remedy
under
these
circumstances.
but
they
should
--
the
trial
court
should
have
just
reversed
and
sent
it
back
for
reconsideration
and
should
not
have
directed
transfer,
and
i
would
like
to
deal
with
that
in
the
time
remaining
to
me.
if
your
honors
please,
the
government
has
submitted
in
--
and
as
indeed
it
must,
as
indeed
it
must
as
follows.
i'm
reading
from
page
34
of
their
brief.
it
would
be
proper,
i'm
reversing
it
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
direct
transfer
if
it,
“should
be
clear
that
without
considering
the
improper
factor,”
reading
from
page
34,
"the
district
court
would've
had
no
alternative
but
to
transfer".
they've
said
there.
that
---
that
is
correct.
that's
our
position.
that
they
say
that
unless
it
should
be
clear
that
without
considering
the
improper
factor,
the
district
court
would've
had
no
alternative
but
to
transfer
the
direction
of
transfer
should
not
have
been,
it
should
not
have
been
incorporated
in
the
writ.
i
say
to
your
honors
that
on
this
record,
the
court
had
no
alternative
but
to
transfer
if
he
was
going
to
be,
as
if
he
must
be
in
exercising
his
discretion,
if
he
was
going
to
be
governed
by
the
record
in
this
case
rather
than
--
than
something
else.
for
the
reasons
that
i've
stated,
suppose
this
goes
back,
suppose
this
goes
back
to
the
district
court
as
the
government
would
have,
your
honors,
direct
to
reconsider
this
matter
in
the
light
of
the
opinion
and
the
present
concession
of
the
government
that
he
had
no
business
going
into
this
fair
trial
matter.
suppose
it
did,
what
could
he
say
as
to
a
reason
for
holding
it
in
danville
that
he
has
already
said?
now,
i
have
a
great
respect
for
judge
platt
before
whom
i've
tried
a
number
of
cases.
but
it
would
be
only
human,
be
only
human
having
--
having
denied
transfer
and
considered
this
record
as
he
did
for
him
to
say
the
second
time,
“oh,
well,
sure
i
consider
this
fair
trial
in
minnesota
business.
but
that
isn't
a
real
thing.
i
am
going
to
keep
this
case
anyway."
and
i
say
he
couldn't
keep
it
in
anyway
for
any
reason
that's
a
substantial
reason
and
no
matter
what
he
said,
he
couldn't
controvert
the
facts
that
i
read
to
the
court
from
the
opinion
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
because
there
aren't
any
facts
in
this
record
contrary
to
that.
i
submit
therefore,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct
and
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
