justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
wonder,
suppose
the
plaintiff
was
clad
in
a
pair
of
shorts
and
a
sweatshirt,
jockey
shirt
or
something
like
that,
just
in
the
--
even
though
he
assured
the
foreman
that
i'm
--
i'm
alright,
i
prefer
working
this
way
in
five
degree
below
zero
and
no
responsibility
of
the
--
paternalistic
to
suggest
that
the
railroad
was
having
a
duty
in
that
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
i
thought
the
plaintiff
testified
that
the
foreman
agreed
that
apparently
the
plaintiff
came
to
the
foreman
and
said
i'm
cold.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
plaintiff
says
that
he
did
nothing
about
it
and
kept
out
there
until
4
o'clock
in
the
morning.
and
true,
the
foreman
says,
"no,
i
didn't.
i
sent
him
to
the
truck."
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
it
was
a
duty
and
the
jury
--
wouldn't
at
least
for
the
jury
to
say
whether
on
those
circumstances,
cold
night,
all
the
rest
of
the
circumstances
there
was
--
it
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
wind
was
blowing
too
hard
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
--
suppose
that
he
had
known
of
--
that
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
just
proposed
that
midnight
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
had
a
couple
of
frozen
fingers
which
ultimately
he
lost.
now,
would
it
be
any
defense
on
the
issue
of
duty
that
this
was
an
emergency
that
he
really
couldn't
spare
to
let
him
go
and
kept
him
working
for
four
hours
because
as
you've
suggested
yourself,
it
was
six
trains
going
to
come
through
there?
this
thing
had
to
be
repaired
and
without
this
plaintiff,
i
don't
suppose
that
you
had
a
crew
large
enough
to
repair
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
just
wonder
whether
--
it
--
it
bear
--
whether
it
bears
on
the
--
on
the
plaintiff's
claim,
assuming
now
a
breach
of
duty
as
i've
--
this
is
hypothesis.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
he
kept
on
there
because
of
the
position
that
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
--
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
where
we
--
or
if
it's
nine.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
their
duty
