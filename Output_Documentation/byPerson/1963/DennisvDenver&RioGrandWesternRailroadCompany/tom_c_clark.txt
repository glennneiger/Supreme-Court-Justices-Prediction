what
about
the

where
he
said
at
12
o'clock
that
he
went
to
a
fire,
the
train
was
going
by?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
the
plaintiff
said
--
the
petitioner
said,
"i
went
to
the
fire.
all
of
us
went
to
fire
while
the
train
was
going
by
and
i
lay
the
wrench
down
there
and
when
i
did,
these
two
fingers
were
clamped

i
had
to
pull
them
apart.
like

the
other

you
say?
i
said,
"it
looks
like
my
hand's
frozen
to
that
wrench."
justice

so
he
brought
it
to
the
attention
of
the
foreman
at
12
o'clock.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
he
contends
as
i
remember
that
the
wind
was
blowing
through
this
cut
so
if
the
fire
--
the
blaze
of
the
fire
and
the
heat
of
the
fire
was
dissipated.
i
don't
know
what

this
truck,
as
i
read,
that's
why
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
his
hands
were
sticking
to
this
wrench
which
i
understand
was
about
four
feet
long.
justice
tom

is
that

justice
tom
c.
clark
i'm
not
familiar
with
railroading
but
it
appears
to
me
that
might
put
the
foreman
on
notice
that
here's
the
man
that's
got
a
frozen
hand.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
suppose
take
him
back
to
the
hospital
(inaudible).
i
don't
know
what
they
do
to
that.

tom
c.

that

so
he
kept
all
working
till
5'oclock.
