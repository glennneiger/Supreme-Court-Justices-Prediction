mr.
wayne
l.
black
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
honorable
court.
this
is
the
case
of
a
railroad
section
hand
who
brings
his
action
against
the
denver
and
rio
grand
western
railroad
company,
his
employer,
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
he
alleges
that
a
series
of
events
took
place
on
january
2nd
and
3rd
of
1960
and
that
he
--
he
was
injured
as
a
result
of
those
events.
he
filed
and
tried
his
action
in
the
third
judicial
district
court
of
salt
lake
county
and
a
jury
returned
the
verdict
in
his
favor
in
the
amount
of
$20,000,
reducing
the
verdict
to
$10,000
for
contributory
negligence.
the
utah
state
supreme
court
reversed
the
finding
of
the
jury
as
approved
by
the
trial
court
and
we
are
here
today
after
the
granting
of
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
determine
this
case
on
its
merit.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
simply
this,
an
open
joint
between
two
rails
had
occurred
some
16
miles
out
of
green
river,
utah
and
it
became
necessary
to
repair
this
open
joint.
the
crew
consisting
of
the
foreman
chronopolous,
a
truck
driver
and
two
section
men,
met
at
5
p.m.
on
the
late
afternoon
of
january
2nd,
at
the
tool
house
at
green
river,
utah
and
proceeded
by
track
to
the
appointed
task
out
on
the
plains
of
utah
some
16
miles
from
the
closest
place
where
people
resided.
an
open
joint
briefly
is
described
as
a
situation
which
occurs
when
rails
contract
in
extremely
cold
weather.
these
rails
are
some
39
feet
in
length
and
in
this
particular
instance,
the
ex
--
the
contraction
had
caused
an
open
--
opening
between
two
joints
of
some
1
and
3/4
inches
in
length.
these
open
joints
are
repaired
briefly
by
the
loosening
of
certain
angle
bars
at
each
joint,
working
away
from
the
open
joint
and
then
prying
the
rails
toward
the
opening
and
ultimately
realigning
the
holes
between
the
angle
bars
and
the
rails,
so
that
new
bolts
can
be
placed
in
the
location
on
either
side
of
the
open
joint.
the
crew
of
which
the
plaintiff
was
a
member,
was
shorthand
of
a
mr.
powell,
delmar
powell,
who
is
a
regular
member
of
this
crew,
could
not
be
located
and
so
to
begin
with,
we
have
a
shorthanded
crew.
also,
if
other
crews
were
available,
if
other
crews
were
needed,
our
evidence
and
our
testimony
was
that
they
were
available.
we
have
the
testimony
of
the
foreman
chronopolous
to
the
effect
that
if
other
crew
--
another
crew
was
needed
to
relieve
his
crew,
he
could
have
asked
for
it,
but
that
he
didn't
do
so.
also
we
had
testimony
from
the
plaintiff
who
was
a
16-year
section
man
with
much
experience
in
this
area
of
work
who
testified
that
the
repair
of
an
open
joint
isn't
in
the
nature
of
an
emergency.
by
the
use
of
a
dutchman
and
train
orders,
trains
can
be
slowed
down
at
these
open
joints
and
can
go
across
them
at
a
restricted
speed
in
very
good
order.
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
this
particular
night,
as
the
night
were
long,
three
trains
were
slowed
down
thusly
and
proceeded
across
a
dutchman
and
to
their
appointed
destinations.
the
temperature
was
bitter
cold.
the
evidence
is
that
the
temperature
range
starting
on
this
particular
nights
were
from
10
degrees
above
until
it
reached
5
degrees
below
as
the
evening
were
long.
the
evidence
is
that
winds
were
blowing
across
this
plain
and
through
the
cut
where
this
open
joint
was
located.
and
that
they
were
of
such
nature
that
the
fire
that
this
men
devised
by
using
an
old
railroad
tie
was
inadequate
to
furnish
effective
heat
for
warming
purposes.
although,
this
fire
was
the
means
provided
that
night
for
warming
these
men
in
turn
as
they
went
about
their
appointed
task.
now,
the
foreman
was
in
continuous
charge
throughout
the
night.
he
made
the
decisions.
he
issued
the
orders.
he
decided
who
should
work,
where
they
should
work
and
it
was
under
his
plan
of
work
that
these
men
in
turn,
went
to
the
fire
from
time
to
time
throughout
the
night
in
quest
of
warmth.
and
at
midnight,
at
midnight
after
these
men
had
worked
for
some
seven
hours,
the
plaintiff
testified
that
his
hands
were
tingling.
he
said
they
started
to
burn
more
less
like
your
hand
burns
when
it
goes
asleep.
and
he
notified
the
foreman
of
this
fact
and
advised
the
foreman,
he
said,
"i
said
it
looks
like
my
hand's
frozen
to
the
wrench"
and
yet
he
testified
--
mr.
wayne
l.
black
no.
mr.
wayne
l.
black
that's
correct
your
honor.
he
stated,
quote,
"i
said
it
looks
like
my
hand's
frozen
to
that
wrench."
mr.
wayne
l.
black
yes
your
honor.
and
the
foreman
himself
testified,
question
-
now
during
this
particular
night,
mr.
chronopolous,
did
mr.
dennis
complained
to
you
about
the
cold?
and
his
answer,
"he
did."
as
the
evening
were
long
and
the
night
moved
toward
the
early
morning
hours,
the
fire
grew
dim
and
two
men,
one
of
whom
was
the
plaintiff
went
out
in
quest
of
some
other
means
of
warmth
and
they
tore
a
tie
from
a
track
car
setter,
brought
the
tie
back
to
where
they
were
working
and
made
a
new
fire
which
they
used
for
the
rest
of
the
shift.
the
evidence
is
that
a
regular
shift
is
eight
hours
and
our
testimony
is
that
from
the
tool
house
--
back
to
the
tool
house,
this
evening
was
12
hours.
and
so,
there
is
the
evidentiary
basis
upon
which
the
plaintiff
brings
his
case
before
this
court
today.
the
temperature
ranged
from
10
degrees
above
to
5
degrees
below
zero
during
the
course
of
these
12
hours,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
l.
black
no,
there
isn't
your
honor.
the
only
man
that
was
frostbitten
was
the
plaintiff
and
yet
the
other
member
of
the
crew
testified
that
all
of
these
men
were
cold
during
this
night
and
the
plaintiff
testified
that
this
was
the
coldest
night
he
ever
remembers
working
on
such
a
shift,
on
such
a
job.
now,
our
first
point
of
course
is
that
there
is
an
evidentiary
basis
for
a
filing
of
neglect
in
this
case.
and
in
reviewing
this
evidentiary
basis,
we
call
attention
to
the
remark
of
justice
holmes
in
the
hadley
case
where
he
said
that
many
times,
"the
hole
maybe
greater
from
the
some
of
the
parts
in
considering
questions
of
neglect."
mr.
wayne
l.
black
here
--
mr.
wayne
l.
black
here,
we
have
your
honor
first,
a
situation
where
the
foreman
knowing
of
the
nature
of
the
task
that
lay
ahead
and
having
an
opportunity
when
he
could
have
arranged
for
a
relief
crew
after
a
reasonable
length
of
time
to
come
out
onto
that
plain
and
relieve
this
crew,
failed
to
do
so
and
went
out
to
his
appointed
task
shorthanded.
we
have
the
second
situation
where
the
foreman
at
midnight
being
advised
that
the
plaintiff's
hand
was
frozen
to
the
wrench,
advised
that
the
plaintiff
was
cold
in
this
manner
and
aware
of
the
surrounding
circumstances
failed
to
relieve
the
plaintiff
of
his
task
but
kept
him
out
in
that
cold
taking
his
turn
at
the
fire
and
that
to
work
for
an
additional
three
and
one
half
hours
of
time.
mr.
wayne
l.
black
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
l.
black
yes,
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
conflict
your
honor
and
because
we
feel
that
the
case
must
be
taken
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
plaintiff
here
today.
we
state
the
fact
as
being
that
he
did
not
send
the
plaintiff
to
the
track
but
kept
him
out
there
for
an
additional
three
and
a
half
hours.
mr.
wayne
l.
black
now
--
mr.
wayne
l.
black
yes.
the
jury
believed
it
and
the
trial
court
believed
it
your
honor.
but
when
we
reached
the
utah
supreme
court,
we
found
some
disagreement.
the
original
opinion
of
the
utah
supreme
court
contained
an
erroneous
statement
of
fact
on
this
particular
matter,
where
the
utah
supreme
court
stated
it
is
undisputed
that
the
only
time
he
mentioned
being
cold,
the
foreman
suggested
that
he
go
to
the
truck
for
that
purpose
and
he
did
so.
now,
this
simply
wasn't
that
fact
because
the
plaintiff
had
denied
saying
and
so
after
having
this
matter
called
to
its
attention,
the
utah
court
issued
a
corrected
opinion
and
deleted
this
thing,
deleted
this
statement
of
fact
and
then
however,
went
ahead
to
say,
however
it
is
of
significance.
using
this
point,
justice
white
has
brought
up,
it
is
of
significance
that
other
members
of
the
crew
denied
this
and
stated
and
testified
that
at
midnight
after
being
advised
of
being
--
of
the
cold,
the
foreman
sent
the
plaintiff
to
the
truck
and
he
went
there.
and
of
course,
this
is
the
kind
of
fact
when
and
factual
consideration
of
matters
by
the
utah
supreme
court
with
which
we
find
disagreement
here
today.
the
utah
supreme
court
stated
at
page
7
of
its
opinion,
its
corrected
opinion,
other
than
the
reference
to
its
attempt
to
try
to
get
the
one
more
crew
member
who
couldn't
be
located
there
is
no
evidence
that
more
men
or
crews
were
available.
this
simply
isn't
supported
by
the
record
because
foreman
chronopolous
testified
at
record
116.
question
-
now,
you
have
the
right
to
request
help
from
other
crews
don't
you
if
you
need
them?
answer
-
yes,
if
i
need
it.
question
-
if
you
felt
that
you
needed
help
in
this
case,
you
could've
asked
for
help
from
this
other
crew,
couldn't
you?
answer
-
yes.
and
of
course
that
belies
the
statement
of
fact
made
by
the
utah
supreme
court.
the
utah
supreme
court
then
went
on
to
say,
it
must
be
appreciated
that
the
railroad
is
in
a
business
which
literally
moves
on
and
must
be
kept
moving.
and
again,
in
the
face
of
difficulty
such
as
here
arose
it
must
resort
to
the
best
exit
--
expedient
available
to
meet
these
responsibilities
and
to
keep
its
trains
running
on
schedule.
and
then
again,
the
jury
cannot
be
allowed
to
second-guess
management.
of
course,
juries
are
allowed
to
second-guess
management
if
the
court
pleases,
in
all
safe
place
to
work
cases
for
instance
and
many
other
cases
where
unsafe
procedures
and
practices
are
alleged
and
proved
in
federal
employers'
liability
act
cases.
if
the
management's
judgment
is
poor
and
a
railroad
man
is
injured
as
a
result,
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
it
is
our
position
that
liability
attaches
and
the
idea
that
management
could
be
its
own
judge
and
jury
in
matters
of
this
kind
are
borne
to
the
field
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
cases.
now,
a
summary
of
the
utah
supreme
court's
opinion
reduced
to
simplest
terms,
is
that
the
that
the
railroad
owes
no
duty
of
supervising
the
attire
of
its
men,
has
no
responsibility
for
weather
conditions,
is
immune
from
liability
for
bad
judgment
on
the
part
of
management
and
therefore
can
keep
its
employees
out
in
freezing
weather
as
long
as
it
desires
whether
it
be
eight
hours
or
12
hours
or
20
hours
with
absolute
impunity.
it
is
our
position
that
if
the
railroad
company,
it's
foreman
in
this
instance,
has
a
duty
to
exercise
a
judgment
as
to
the
length
of
time
that
its
men
can
reasonably
be
kept
out
under
such
adverse
conditions
as
existed
here,
then
it
had
to
the
duty
to
exercise
that
judgment
by
exercising
ordinary
care
in
exercising
that
judgment.
and
if
a
jury
could
find
that
in
that
judgment,
exercise
of
ordinary
care
is
a
question
of
--
on
which
reasonable
minds
may
differ
then
our
petition
has
merit
here
today.
now,
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent,
i
want
to
quickly
call
attention
to
one
or
two
factual
mistakes.
at
page
2,
the
statement
appears,
"all
available
section
men
in
the
area
were
called
to
assist
in
the
repair."
and
of
course,
i
have
already
read
the
testimony
of
foreman
chronopolous
that
if
he
had
needed
and
wanted
to,
he
could've
asked
for
another
crew
to
relieve
this
crew.
again
at
page
4,
petitioner
denied
that
he
got
into
the
track
at
midnight
but
he
did
not
refute
the
testimony
of
the
foreman
that
he
was
told
to
do
so.
however,
at
record
64,
we
find
the
following
testimony
from
the
plaintiff,
"i
don't
remember
him
telling
me
get
in
no
truck."
and
then
at
page
5,
petitioner
made
only
one
complaint
about
the
cold
at
which
time
he
was
told
to
get
into
the
heated
cab
of
the
truck.
and
of
course
the
testimony,
the
testimony
of
the
plaintiff
at
record
64,
"i
don't
remember
him
telling
me
to
get
in
no
truck."
and
so
at
page
14,
also
contrary
to
fact
is
counsel's
statement
that
the
foreman
knew
that
petitioner
was
in
the
process
of
suffering
injury
from
overexposure.
there
is
no
such
evidence
in
the
record.
and
yet
the
record
at
page
35
and
36,
question
-
was
the
foreman
there
too?
answer
-
foreman
and
two
other
men.
question
-
what
did
you
say?
answer
-
i
said
it
looks
like
my
hand's
frozen
to
that
wrench.
now,
coming
to
point
number
2
is
our
position
also
that
the
utah
court
has
inappropriately
found
and
held
that
the
neglect
of
the
plaintiff
himself
was
the
sole
proximate
cause
of
his
injury.
in
the
original
opinion,
the
utah
supreme
court
referred
to
plaintiff's
own
neglect
or
error
of
judgment.
but
in
the
re
--
corrected
opinion,
we
find
a
modification
of
that
language
to
plaintiff's
own
conduct.
but
here,
we
have
two
men,
the
foreman
in
charge
of
this
crew,
having
the
responsibility
for
his
men,
having
the
right
and
the
duty
to
determine
how
long
they
shall
be
kept
out
in
these
weather
conditions.
and
taking
his
men
out
16
miles
onto
an
open
plain,
windy
plain
harboring
around
zero
temperature
throughout
the
night
and
keeping
them
there
for
12
solid
hours
from
portal-to-portal
without
so
much
as
a
coffee
break,
without
so
much
as
any
relief
other
than
occasional
visits
back
to
an
inadequate
fire.
and
we
have
the
plaintiff
again,
you'd
answer,
a
man
of
limited
experience
trained
to
take
and
follow
orders,
going
along
with
the
foreman's
instructions
throughout
that
night
and
the
utah
court
holding
that
the
plaintiff
was
negligent
but
that
the
defendant
had
no
responsibility
and
was
free
from
negligence,
and
that
is
why
we're
here
today.
now,
the
third
point
which
we
raised
in
this
appeal
is
that
the
doctrine
of
assumption
of
risk
has
been
resurrected
by
the
holding
of
the
utah
supreme
court.
here
is
what
the
utah
supreme
court
said,
"neither
party
can
be
blamed
for
the
cold
weather,
both
were
fully
aware
of
it.
the
plaintiff
himself
was
in
the
best
position
to
know
about
the
sufficiency
of
his
clothing
and
in
fact
holding
that
it's
the
plaintiff's
responsibility.
he
should
seek
some
safe
refuge
from
the
cold
that
existed
that
night
at
his
own
peril.
he
should
meet
head
on
the
foreman
who
was
in
charge
of
this
crew
and
resist
the
duties
that
were
assigned
by
that
foreman
at
his
peril."
and
of
course,
this
is
contrary
to
the
holding
of
the
taylor
case
which
has
stated
that
every
message
of
the
doctrine
of
assumption
at
risk
has
been
obliterated
from
the
law
by
the
1939
amendment.
mr.
wayne
l.
black
20,000
reduced
to
10,
for
contributory
negligence
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
l.
black
they
split
the
damage
in
half.
mr.
wayne
l.
black
and
now
in
conclusion,
we
once
brought
before
this
court,
the
case
of
cory
versus
the
southern
pacific
railroad
company.
a
train
had
come
to
undesired
emergency
stop
because
of
the
defective
triple
block
and
a
truck
car
following
along
behind
rammed
into
the
rear
of
that
train
and
decedent
was
killed.
the
utah
supreme
court
held
that
the
undesired
stop
which
caused
--
may
have
caused
the
decedent's
death
in
a
philosophical
sense
but
was
not
a
cause
in
a
legal
sense.
this
court
reversed
and
stated
that
it
would
not
allow
the
humanitarian
purposes
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
to
be
defeated
by
resort
to
dialectical
settlement.
but
here
again,
we
have
the
utah
court
defeating
a
railroader's
case
in
the
following
language,
quote,
"practically
any
type
of
industrial
accident
could
in
some
way
have
been
prevented
by
the
application
of
precautions
perceivable
by
hindsight,
if
nothing
else,
the
plaintiff
could
have
stood
(inaudible)."
this
hart
--
harsh
language,
it
is
our
position
and
outstand
the
life
of
objective
inquiry.
it
cannot
stand
against
lavender
versus
kurn
where
this
court
stated,
only
where
there
is
a
complete
absence
of
promotive
facts
does
a
reversible
error
of
duty.
it
cannot
stand
against
bailey
versus
central
vermont,
where
this
court
stated
to
brief
--
deprive
railroad
workers
of
a
jury
trial
in
close
or
doubtful
cases
is
to
take
away
a
goodly
portion
of
the
relief
which
congress
has
afforded
them.
and
it
cannot
stand
against
the
rogers
case
where
this
court
say
--
said
that
judicial
appraisal
is
narrowly
limited
to
the
single
inquiry,
whether
negligence
of
the
employer
played
any
part
at
all
in
producing
the
injury
or
death.
and
it
cannot
stand
against
jacob
versus
the
city
of
new
york,
where
this
court
said
that
the
right
of
trial
by
jury
is
a
basic
and
fundamental
feature
of
our
system
of
jurisprudence,
a
right
so
fundamental
and
sacred
to
the
citizens
that
it
should
be
jealously
guarded
by
the
courts
of
our
land.
the
conclusion,
i
simply
want
to
say
that
the
narrow
and
niggardly
construction
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
of
which
the
utah
supreme
court
is
guilty
in
this
case
and
our
judgment
requires
the
reversal
of
this
decision.
mr.
wayne
l.
black
certain
errors
in
the
briefs,
recitation
of
facts
by
the
supreme
court
were
called
to
its
attention
in
our
petition
for
rehearing
and
both
errors
were
corrected
at
least
some
of
them,
by
the
corrected
opinion.
and
i
wanted
--
i
called
the
attention
particularly
to
the
error
that
i
think
is
most
significant
where
the
utah
court
when
it
decided
to
defeat
the
plaintiff's
case
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
fact
was
that
at
midnight,
he
had
complained
of
the
cold
and
had
been
sent
to
the
truck
where
he
remained
the
rest
of
the
night.
whereas
the
true
fact
was
that
he
complained
of
the
cold
and
of
his
fingers
being
frozen
to
the
wrench
at
midnight,
but
was
kept
out
in
the
cold,
performing
his
work
for
an
additional
three
and
a
half
hours
before
being
sent
to
the
truck
to
turn
it
around
at
the
very
conclusion
of
the
work.
so,
we
will
submit
this
case
your
honor
with
this
statement,
this
old
railroad
(inaudible)
is
entitled
to
its
jury
verdict.
