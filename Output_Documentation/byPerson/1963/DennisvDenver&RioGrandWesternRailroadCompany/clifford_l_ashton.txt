mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
friend,
mr.
black,
with
whom
i
have
tried
many
cases,
has
cited
i
think
in
his
brief
pretty
well
the
facts
in
this
case.
however,
i
think
it
would
be
important
for
me
to
cite
some
of
the
facts
which
i
think
are
important
to
our
case.
the
d&rg
operates
in
this
particular
area,
across
the
green
river
end
up
through
the
country
about
16
miles
from
green
river
where
this
accident
happened.
d&rg
is
most
that
you
may
know,
is
a
relatively
small
mountain
railroad.
in
the
area
of
green
river,
they
have
a
section
crew
which
is
composed
of
from
four
to
five
men.
on
occasions,
this
section
crew
will
only
have
two
men
out
and
on
occasions,
it
will
have
five.
on
this
particular
occasion,
there
was
another
section
crew
which
was
adjacent
to
this
area.
in
fact,
the
section
crew
which
had
supervision
to
the
very
track
where
these
acts
had
happened.
but
this
being
a
cold
night
and
i
think
mr.
black
has
stated
the
testimony
correctly
relative
to
this,
is
being
a
cold
night,
the
rails
had
contracted
and
the
railroad
problem
had
developed.
and
the
problem
which
develops
is
that
when
the
railroad
contract
it
leaves
an
open
--
opening
between
the
tracks
so
that
there
is
a
very
serious
danger
of
derailment.
and
that
therefore
becomes
necessary
for
the
railroad
to
go
over
its
track
and
correct
these
open
--
openings
in
the
rail.
on
this
particular
case,
the
group
that
had
control
of
this
particular
track
where
this
particular
open
cut
had
occurred
had
already
been
called
out
as
it
appears
in
the
record,
to
take
care
of
another
open
--
opening
in
the
rail.
and
this
particular
crew,
therefore,
was
called
to
go
and
take
care
of
the
opening
in
the
rail
which
was
on
their
division.
so
that
in
the
record,
there
is
no
use
talking
about
calling
other
help.
true,
mr.
chronopolous
said
that
he
could
have
called
other
help.
he
could
have
called
if
the
court
please,
but
there
was
no
other
help
available
because
on
this
occasion,
all
of
the
section
crews
were
out
closing
these
openings
on
the
rail.
now,
these
openings
in
the
rail
as
the
record
will
show,
have
to
be
closed,
otherwise
there
is
serious
danger
of
derailment.
now
there's
a
temporary
device
which
can
be
improvised
for
a
temporary
time
in
order
to
get
the
cars
over
the
opening
and
that
is
they
put
in
what
is
called
a
dutchman
as
mr.
black
has
explained
to
you
which
is
a
short
piece
of
rail
which
fits
into
the
opening.
and
then
if
they
have
a
man
there,
they
can
take
the
train
cross
very
slowly
over
this
opening.
but
the
undisputed
testimony
is
that
if
you
leave
this
opening
in
there
very
long,
there's
a
danger
that
it
might
twist
sideways
and
so
that
it
will
slip
out
so
that
you
will
have
a
derailment.
and
therefore,
this
temporary
measure
is
only
placed
there
while
the
men
are
working
on
these
opening
cuts
and
is
not,
and
this
is
the
decision
of
management,
is
not
permitted
to
exist
except
temporarily
while
work
construction
is
being
--
is
in
progress.
on
this
particular
night,
there
were
six
trains
that
were
scheduled
to
go
through
this
particular
area.
in
fact
when
this
section
crew
got
there
on
this
occasion,
one
train
was
already
waiting
and
this,
i
don't
think
suggested
and
i
don't
think
should
be
held
and
i
don't
think
the
jury
so
found
that
the
railroad
is
obligated
to
shutdown
its
operations
during
the
night
until
it's
daylight
and
until
the
weather
is
warm
enough
that
they
can
make
this
correction
in
the
opening
in
the
gap.
i
don't
even
think
mr.
black
suggests
that.
the
question
is
how
are
we
to
do
this
work
in
the
most
reasonable
manner?
but
mr.
chronopolous,
when
he
was
called
and
told
that
there
was
a
train
waiting
at
this
opening
in
the
rail,
called
out
his
section
crew.
he
couldn't
find
one
of
them.
one
of
them
was
missing,
so
he
took
only
four.
before
he
took
these
men
out,
he
noticed
their
clothing
and
he
noticed
that
the
plaintiff
did
not
have
on
overshoes
and
that
the
plaintiff
didn't
have
on
woolen
mittens
like
the
rest.
the
plaintiff
apparently
had
on
two
pair
of
gloves,
a
canvass
glove
and
rubber
glove
which
fit
over
this.
now,
the
plaintiff
was
a
section
man
who
had
worked
in
this
particular
area
where
he
lived
most
of
his
life
and
he
worked
for
the
railroad
for
16
years.
and
some
comment
was
made
by
the
section
foreman
and
some
discussion
was
had,
he
thought
he
was
dressed
warm
enough
and
the
plaintiff
said,
he
thought
he
was
and
so
they
went
out
to
the
particular
job.
when
they
got
out
there,
the
first
thing
they
did
was
split
some
ties
and
build
two
fires.
the
way
they
do
this
worked
two
men
worked
on
each
joint.
they
separate
the
joint
and
then
they
go
on
pull
the
39
foot
rails
up
gradually
and
they
have
to
go
several
lanes
back
in
order
to
bring
up
enough
to
fill
in
the
gap.
two
men
worked
on
each
joint,
it
is
suggested
by
mr.
black
that
we
should've
had
more
help.
i
don't
know
how
we
could've
had
more
help
when
nor
help
is
not
available.
but
if
we
had,
how
that
could've
changed
the
nature
of
the
work,
two
men
working
on
each
joint
and
having
to
wait
until
a
rail
was
moved
and
the
record
will
bear
this
out.
during
the
evening,
the
plaintiff
indicated
as
has
been
indicated
by
your
honor,
that
his
hand
was
frozen
to
a
particular
wrench
which
he
was
working,
which
he
had
a
glove.
he
did
not
report
to
the
foreman
that
this
was
in
anyway
doing
him
any
damage.
he
simply
said
that
his
hand
was
frozen.
he
said,
however,
in
the
trial,
that
at
that
time,
he
felt
a
tingling
sensation
in
his
hand.
this
--
not
was
in
anyway
--
this
was
in
no
way
communicated
to
his
foreman.
then
there's
a
dispute
in
the
evidence
and
of
course,
i
agree
with
mr.
black,
we
must
indulge
every
inference
in
favor
of
the
facts
for
the
plaintiff.
there's
a
dispute.
the
plaintiff
doesn't
remember
whether
he
was
in
the
truck
--
truck
a
half
hour
or
not.
all
the
other
witnesses
testified
that
he
claimed
he
was
cold
about
midnight
and
he
got
in
the
truck
and
remained
in
the
truck
until
they
left
the
shift
about
4
o'clock,
which
would
mean
he
would
be
--
taking
the
testimony,
if
their
testimony
is
correct,
and
i
shouldn't
even
be
wasting
your
honors'
time
with
it
because
we
must
take
his
testimony,
which
he
said,
"he
couldn't
remember
if
he
was
in
there
about
a
half
hour."
he
then
went
back
and
found
out
the
next
day.
he,
for
the
first
time,
found
out
that
he
was
having
this
difficulty
in
his
hand.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
case
is
relatively
simple.
it
gets
to
this,
is
the
--
does
the
railroad
have
a
duty
to
see
that
a
man
is
properly
clothed
before
he
goes
out
on
the
job.
even
if
there
is
that
duty
and
no
case
is
so
--
it
certainly
so
held
at
this
point.
even
if
that's
--
it
has
that
duty,
the
plaintiff
himself
said
he
was
properly
clothed
even
though
the
foreman
had
some
doubts
about
it.
and
he
said,
"he,
himself
knew
when
he
was
warm
and
when
he
could
go
to
the
fire."
there
is
some
suggestion
in
the
case
--
in
the
argument
that
this
man
was
not
permitted
to
go
to
the
fire
unless
the
foreman
permitted
him
to
do
so.
that
is
not
the
evidence
in
this
case
and
i
appeal
to
the
record
which
your
honors
of
course,
will
see.
he
is
told
--
in
the
record
is
undisputed
that
he
could
go
to
the
fire
anytime
he
wanted
to.
that
he
himself
was
the
best
judge
if
when
he
was
cold
and
when
he
needed
to
go
to
the
fire.
there
is
no
evidence
anywhere
in
the
record
that
anytime
that
he
asked
to
go
to
the
fire
was
not
permitted
to
do
so.
there
is
no
evidence
even
that
when
he
indicated
he
was
cold,
that
he
was
not
permitted
to
go
into
the
truck
even
though
he
says,
he
does
not
remember
that,
he
did
not
refute
on
close
questioning
in
court
that
the
foreman
had
invited
him
to
do
so.
he
said,
he
could
not
remember
that.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
(voice
overlap)
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
if
i
am
or
not
if
the
court
please.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference,
does
it
really?
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
really
in
this
particular
case
unless
to
the
thing
that
he's
assuming
is
the
risk,
it
is
something
that
was
created
by
railroad
--
through
the
railroad's
negligence.
certainly,
his
assumption
of
risk,
weather
conditions,
wouldn't
make
the
railroad
liable,
unless
the
railroad
of
course,
it's
something
itself
that
was
negligence
and
i
--
i
--
i
can
see
your
honors'
point
and
it
maybe
well
taken.
i
don't
think
it
makes
a
difference
in
this
case,
unless
you
can
show
that
the
thing
that
he
assumed,
the
risk
he
assumed
was
something
created
by
the
negligence
of
the
railroad
because
certainly,
the
weather
condition
itself
is
not
anything
that
would
make
the
railroad
liable.
he
assumed
the
risk
of
that.
it
might
possibly
if
you
want
to
reach
that
point,
relieve
him
of
contributory
negligence.
but,
i
don't
think
that
point
really
gets
into
this
case.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
well
--
frankly,
do
i
have
to
get
there
your
honor?
unless
you're
going
to
say
that
there's
some
paternalistic
duty
on
the
part
of
the
railroad
to
see
that
men
are
properly
clothed,
they
are
themselves
the
best
judges
of
what
is
adequate
clothing
for
them.
unless
you're
going
to
say
and
no
court
yet
have
said
that
it's
a
duty
of
the
railroad
to
see
if
these
men
are
clothed
in
certain
ways
to
protect
themselves
against
the
weather.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
yes.
but
he
also,
i
think
in
the
record
would
bear
me
out,
had
worked
for
this
man
16
years
and
that
was
this
man
custom
and
habit
to
wear
canvass
gloves
with
rubber
gloves
over
and
i
think
that's
it.
so
that
his
knowledge
of
that
might
have
gone
further
than
just
what
he
observed
on
that
particular
occasion.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
well
your
honor
it
gets
to
a
point
which
you
--
where
a
direction
you
may
want
to
take
in
this
case.
saying
that
our
duty
is
to
--
is
to
see
that
these
people
are
properly
clothed,
no
court
has
held
so
--
so
far.
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
foreman
asked
him
if
he
was
properly
clothed
and
looked
at
him,
he
said
he
was
alright
and
described
his
clothing
and
this
would
be
the
way
--
had
been
the
way
he
had
clothed
himself
according
to
the
record
for
16
years.
now,
it
may
be.
it
may
be
that
this
court
is
prepared
to
say
that
we
have
some
duty
to
see
that
men
are
properly
clothed.
no
court
has
so
held
yet.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
well,
it
was
--
when
they
--
when
they
came
down
to
get
into
the
place
where
the
work
was
to
be
done,
they
first
have
got
onto
a
section
car
and
they've
gone
along
the
track
to
the
point
designated
then
he
sent
this
man
back
to
get
the
truck
to
bring
down
to
the
point
where
they
were
going
to
work.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
oh
excuse
me,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
the
reason
he
told
him
to
get
in
there,
he
said
the
man
reported
he
was
cold.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
to
protect
himself
--
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
--
from
the
cold.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
and
that
was
the
first
indication
that
he
had
had
from
this
man
that
he
was
being
in
anyway
bothered
by
the
cold.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
no.
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
when
it
becomes
apparent,
when
it
becomes
apparent
that
a
person
is
suffering
from
cold
--
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
--
and
that
there's
something
that
should
be
done
and
i
think
--
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
--
there's
a
duty.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
no,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
but
he
didn't
give
any
indication
of
what
--
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
or
nor
do
i
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
indicated
that
he
was
cold.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
yes.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
well,
if
--
if
you
want
to
take
that
--
to
the
other
point
of
that
is
this
if
the
court
please
that
the
plaintiff
himself
said
that
there
was
at
no
time
that
he
was
prevented
from
going
over
the
fire
to
warm
himself
or
do
anything
else
he
want
to
do
to
warm
himself.
that
he
was
the
best
judge
of
that
and
the
one
he
got
cold
on
other
occasions,
he
went
over
to
the
fire.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
i
don't
--
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
duty
in
this
case
for
this
foreman
to
do
anything
until
it
became
apparent
to
the
foreman,
the
exercise
of
reasonable
care
that
if
he
didn't
act,
this
man
might
be
injured.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
well,
i
think
the
foreman
should
take
--
exercise
a
reasonable
care.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
but
this
foreman
didn't
at
any
time
say
that
he
didn't
--
that
he
didn't
take
care
--
exercise
care
in
that
regard.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
i
think
--
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
but
i
think
the
chief
dispute
that
we
get
into
there
is
one
at
a
time.
there
isn't
any
question
i
don't
think
in
this
record,
that
when
he
told
the
foreman
he
was
cold,
he
got
in
the
truck.
he
disputes
that
it
was
at
midnight.
he
says
it
was
earlier
in
the
morning
about
half
hour
before
he
left.
and
i
think
that
really
in
the
record
gets
to
be
a
dispute
of
time.
i
don't
think
really
in
the
record
there's
any
dispute
that
when
he
told
the
foreman
about
this
matter
that
he
got
into
the
truck
because
he
didn't
get
into
the
truck
but
he
said
it
didn't
happen
at
midnight,
he
didn't
recall
it
happen
there
and
his
best
memory
is
he
was
only
in
the
truck
about
a
half
hour.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
conflict
on
time
i
think
your
honor,
not
on
the
fact
--
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
--
the
foreman
told
him
to
get
into
the
--
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
i
--
i
--
i
--
i
appeal
to
the
record
your
honor,
we'll
have
an
opportunity
to
look
to
because
i
think
our
position
is
clear
and
--
and
your
position
is
clear.
but
i
don't
think
record
is
quite
that
simple
on
it.
i
think
the
real
conflict
is
on
the
point
of
time
as
to
when
this
occurred.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
yes,
sir.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
i
think
that's
the
correct
record.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
yes.
and
at
the
time
he
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
foreman
at
that
time
if
your
honor
please,
they
were
by
the
fire.
can
you
say
that
when
they're
standing
by
the
fire,
the
foreman
there
had
a
--
then
had
a
duty
to
send
him
into
a
truck
to
keep
warm
and
they're
standing
by
fire?
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
i
must
concede
that.
he
said
that
he
went
to
the
fire
--
they
went
to
the
fire
periodically
for
what
little
good
it
did.
and
i
think
also
in
the
record,
he
all
most
--
he
said
they
had
almost
tried
to
put
their
hands
in
the
fire
to
accomplish
any
good
from
it.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
this
is
correct.
this
is
what
the
record
show.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
yes,
this
is
a
large
--
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
--
wrench
which
they
use
on
the
bolting
of
these
particular
--
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
well,
in
any
event,
this
time,
and
obviously
had
at
this
time,
where
they
were
standing
by
a
fire,
it
may
have
put
him
on
notice
but
what
would
he
be
required
to
do
at
that
point?
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
(voice
overlap)
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
well,
he
didn't
say
he
had
a
frozen
hand,
he
said
he
was
cold
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
well,
there
--
there
is
--
your
--
i
--
i
certainly
see
your
point
your
honor
but
i
--
i
don't
think
that
the
railroad
under
those
circumstances
acting
as
a
reasonable
ordinary
person
would
have
done
anything
other
than
they
did.
in
any
event,
he
was
by
the
fire,
in
any
event
he
got
into
the
truck,
in
any
event,
even
taking
his
testimony,
he
wasn't
out
on
--
right
away
any
longer
than
approximately
eight
hours
and
certainly
with
emergency
repairs,
i
don't
suppose
we're
held
to
a
regular
shift.
i
would
like
before
i
conclude,
however,
to
indicate
that
the
misstatements
which
mr.
black
alleges
i
--
i
don't
think
they
are.
he
said
that
we
misquote,
we
said,
"all
available
section
men
in
the
area
were
called
to
assist
in
the
repair",
and
that
is
true.
all
the
assistant
--
all
available
section
men
in
that
area
were
called
and
the
other
section
crew
was
out,
it's
true.
mr.
chronopolous
said
as
i
have
already
indicated
that
he
could
have
called
for
extra
help
if
he
thought
he
needed
it
but
he
did
not.
and
as
the
record
turned
out,
mr.
chronopolous
didn't
know
this
other
crew
was
out.
if
he
had
called,
he
couldn't
have
got
them
because
they
were
out.
he
missed
one
man
who
--
he
was
not
able
to
contact
and
all
the
other
evidence
was
that
this
work
is
done
commonly
and
most
often.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
excuse
me
your
honor
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
certainly,
i
know
what
would
have
happen
your
honor
if
we
had
left
that
scene
at
work
and
had
gone
back
to
green
river
and
had
got
--
had
not
--
and
had
left
that
track
in
an
unattended
condition
for
two
hours.
and
if
there
had
been
a
derailment,
i
know
that
we
would
be
here
and
mr.
black
represented
the
plaintiff
and
had
been
accused
that
the
rank
has
tied
of
negligence
for
doing
just
a
very
thing
that
is
suggested
we
should've
done
here
because
this
high
speed
trains
cannot
upload
or
operate
over
the
--
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
well
--
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
well,
there
are
nine
gentlemen
here
of
excellent
judgment
who
will
have
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
man
exercised
and
re-exercised
reasonable
care
--
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
--
and
whether
or
not
--
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
no.
it
certainly
--
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
it
certainly
is
not
unless
you
--
unless
you
can
say
reasonable
men
could
not
differ
and
that
of
course
is
the
point
and
i
appreciate
that.
and
i
just
don't
think
reasonable
men
could
have
said
that
under
these
circumstances,
the
railroad
should
have
done
or
could
have
done
anything
reasonable
any
more
than
it
did
and
the
courts
--
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
i
don't
think
so
in
this,
if
your
honor
please,
because
this
was
an
emergency
repair
work.
they
had
to
do
the
work
if
they
--
it
has
been
suggested
in
the
counsel
brief
that
we
should
have
taken
a
coffee
break
and
gone
back
into
town
and
left
the
work
and
come
back
another
hour
or
two
later.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
reasonable
and
i
don't
think
it
could
be
found
to
be
reasonable
for
the
reasons
that
i've
already
stated
here.
and
of
course,
railroading
is
not
an
eight
hour
shift
job.
if
the
court
please,
sometimes,
it's
a
four
hours
and
sometimes
it's
a
12
hours
and
sometimes,
i
guess
it's
longer.
certainly
when
we
have
a
wreck,
we
aren't
working
on
an
eight-hour
shift.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
yes.
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
under
this
--
mr.
clifford
l.
ashton
of
course
these
factors
in
--
enter
into
it
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
they'd
make
an
appreciable
difference
in
this
particular
case.
they
--
the
plaintiff
himself
said
he
had
done
this
work
on
many
occasions
and
had
been
out
in
weather
as
cold
as
this.
i
think
at
one
time
he
said
this
was
a
little
colder
than
he
had
before
and
that
he
worked
more
than
eight
hours
on
many
occasions
before
and
this
was
the
usual
number
of
men
who
did
this
kind
of
work.
the
only
point
that
it
--
i
think
you
can
possibly
say
anything
about
is
one
that
the
--
the
--
his
honor
has
raised
about
it
would
have,
we
were
on
a
duty,
put
on
notice,
when
this
man
start
to
complain
about
his
cold
hand.
now,
i
think
under
the
whole
record,
that
looking
at
that,
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
evidence
of
negligence
on
that
particular
regard.
i
don't
think
i
care
to
take
my
full
time
in
this
matter.
the
facts
were
pretty
simple.
the
law
is
very
well-ascertained.
it's
simply
a
question
of
applying.
and
i
appreciate
very
much
the
very
great
honor
of
appearing
before
this
court.
