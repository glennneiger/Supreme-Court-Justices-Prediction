justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
he
didn't
really
inquire
the
foreman
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
efforts
where
he
says
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
go
ahead
brother.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
--
that
the
man
had
a
--
the
foreman
had
seen
him
working
without
gloves
at
all
on
this
night,
and
you
say
there's
no
duty,
i
guess
you
just
mean
that,
there's
no
duty
if
the
fellow
want
to
work
without
gloves
--
justice
byron
r.
white
as
i
understand
the
record,
the
--
when
this
man
showed
up
to
work,
the
foreman
noticed
he
is
wearing
these
--
these
white
cotton
gloves.
and
there's
no
evidence
--
i
don't
see
any
evidence
in
the
record
that
at
that
time
there
is
--
that
he
knew
that
he
had
two
pairs
of
gloves,
he
had
testified
that
four
or
five
hours
after
the
job
begun
he
noticed
he
is
wearing
another
pair
of
gloves.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
--
why
did
--
why
did
--
why
did
the
foreman
say
he
sent
the
man
to
the
track
at
midnight?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
he
said
he
told
him
to
get
into
the
truck
at
midnight
and
he
stayed
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
why
--
so
he
--
he
told
him
to
get
in
the
truck?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
but
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
--
you
think
he
could've
--
without
any
breach
of
duty
dispensed,
let's
assume
the
foreman
was
correct,
admitted
he
actually
told
him
to
get
in
the
truck.
as
far
as
you're
concerned,
he
could
have
dispensed
with
that
statement,
without
any
breach
of
duty?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
how
we
--
isn't
exactly
this
case
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
accepting
the
--
accepting
the
testimony
of
the
--
of
the
plaintiff
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
between
(inaudible)
he
says,
"i'm
cold."
it
--
the
foreman
himself
says,
he
complained
about
the
being
cold.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
what
--
i
don't
know
what
he
indicated.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
i
know
but
it
certainly
is
consistent
with
the
evidence
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
his
hands
were
cold
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
as
well
as
his
ears
maybe
but
maybe
his
hands
too.
and
the
foreman
--
and
the
foreman
apparently,
we
must
believe
didn't
tell
him
to
get
in
the
truck
and
take
care
of
himself.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
part
of
contributory
negligence
i
suppose
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
duty
you
were
talking
about.
and
you
say
there
was
a
duty
here
if
the
--
that
the
foreman
knew
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
the
man
was
complaining
that
he
ought
to
do
something
about
it,
i
believe.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
--
the
fellow
comes
up
and
says,
"i'm
cold.
i'm
really
cold."
what
should
the
foreman
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
which
is
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
nevertheless,
there's
a
clear
conflict
in
the
testimony
as
to
when
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
--
that's
right
--
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly
right.
but
--
but
if
we
accept
his
testimony
is
that,
i
told
--
i
told
the
foreman
at
midnight
i
was
cold
and
he
did
not
tell
me
to
get
into
the
truck
then
i
stayed
out
after
that
and
that's
--
that's
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
that's
the
point,
a
suggestion
that
maybe
different
--
