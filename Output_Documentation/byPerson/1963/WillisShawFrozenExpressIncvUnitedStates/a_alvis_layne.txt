mr.
a.
alvis
layne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
a
statutory
three-judge
district
court
of
the
western
district
of
arkansas,
affirming
as
wholly
proper
and
lawful
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
order
involved
denied
in
part
and
granted
in
part,
the
application
of
willis
shaw
frozen
express
for
operating
rights
as
a
common
carrier
by
motor
vehicle
on
the
so-called
grandfather
provisions
of
the
1958
transportation
act,
section
7
(c).
this
appeal
presents
questions
as
to
the
proper
statutory
interpretation
and
the
administrative
application
of
the
grandfather
section
of
the
1958
act
as
it
applies
to
shaw
and
to
other
common
carriers
of
the
formerly
exempt
agricultural
commodity.
just
a
moment
as
to
the
background
of
the
1958
transportation
act
and
the
provision
which
this
court
is
asked
to
determine
as
to
its
interpretation
and
appropriate
administrative
application.
first,
the
1958
transportation
act
fixed
the
limit
and
the
scope
of
the
agricultural
exemption
from
the
economic
regulation
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
it
did
so
by
saying
that
it
--
certain
commodities,
the
interpretation
that
had
been
placed
by
the
courts
and
the
commission
with
respect
to
certain
commodities
was
to
be
it.
this
is
the
limit.
these
are
the
commodities
that
are
to
be
agricultural
commodities.
these
are
the
commodities
that
can
be
transported,
free
of
the
certificate
and
rate
regulation
requirements
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
applicable
to
motor
carriers
of
general
commodity.
also,
and
the
source
of
the
controversy
in
this
case,
the
1958
statute
specifically
provided
that
certain
items
which
had
been
determined
to
be
exempt
agricultural
commodities
were
no
longer
to
be
exempt
and
were
to
be
subjected
to
economic,
that
is
to
say
rate
and
certificate
and
permit
requirements,
operating
authority
requirements
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
this
fell
into
--
and
i
don't
want
to
get
into
an
argument
about
the
--
whether
itâ€™s
a
group
or
a
class,
but
this
fell
into
roughly
two
groups.
one
group
was
a
group
of
frozen
commodities.
that
is
commodity
--
agricultural
commodities
that
had
been
subjected
to
freezing
and
therefore
were
transported
in
a
frozen
state.
these
were
the
frozen
fruits,
berries
and
vegetable.
these
were
subjected
for
the
first
time
to
economic
regulation
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
second
group,
in
general,
were
commod
--
agricultural
commodities
not
produced
in
this
country
but
imported.
they
were
agricultural
commodities
not
grown,
harvested
and
marketed
by
our
farmers.
they
were
cocoa
beans,
coffee
beans,
tea,
bananas
or
hemp,
and
wool
imported
from
any
foreign
country,
wool
tops
and
noils,
and
wool
waste.
that
is
imported
wool.
the
same
1958
statute
provided
specifically
that
cooked
or
uncooked
frozen
fish
was
to
continue
to
be
exempt.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
that
aspect,
the
statute
broaden
somewhat
the
exemption
from
economic
regulation
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
transportation
of
fish
and
the
shellfish
product.
now,
as
to
the
commodities,
frozen
fruits,
frozen
berries
and
frozen
vegetable,
the
cocoa
beans,
the
coffee,
tea,
the
bananas
and
the
wool,
imported
wool,
the
statute
in
section
7
(c)
created
grandfather
rights.
and
they
used
exactly
the
same
language
in
the
1958
statute
that
they
used
in
the
1935
statute
when
interstate
cooking
was
first
made
subject
to
economic
regulation,
rate,
certificate
and
operating
authority
regulation
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
it
provided
in
exact
language
and
this
is
the
language
of
the
1958
statute.
it
says
that
operating
rights
are
to
be
issued
without
further
proceedings
to
those
making
application
who
have
been
in
bona
fide
operation,
and
the
statute
uses
the
term
"bona
fide
operation"
on
may
1,
1958
over
any
route
or
routes
or
with
any
--
within
any
territory
of
the
commodities
made
subject
to
regulation
and
has
so
operated
since
that
time
except
as
to
seasonal
variations
or
interruptions
in
control
over
which
the
carrier
had
no
control.
now,
as
i
have
said,
this
language
was
precisely
the
same
language
used
in
the
1935
statute
and
that
language
was
considered
at
length
by
two
case
--
in
two
cases
in
this
court
which
i
considered
dispositive
of
the
issues
now
placed
before
the
court.
those
cases
read
and
applied
to
the
situation,
to
the
statute,
both
as
to
its
interpretation
and
application
will
result
in
a
reversal
of
the
judgment
below
and
it
remanded
this
case
for
an
appropriate
consideration
under
the
statute,
and
the
two
cases
are,
alton
railroad
versus
the
united
states
in
315
u.s.
15
and
united
states
versus
carolina
freight
carriers,
315
u.s.
475,
both
written
by
mr.
justice
douglas.
now,
if
you
apply
what
the
court
said
in
those
cases,
this
order
cannot
stand.
in
order
to
demonstrate
that,
it's
necessary
for
me
to
tell
you
something
about
as
briefly
as
i
can,
the
shaw
--
willis
shaw
frozen
express
and
its
predecessor,
willie
shaw,
it's
president
and
present
owner.
it
began
a
trucking
business
in
1938.
he
transported
primarily
fresh
vegetables,
berries
and
live
poultry.
when
these
products
began
to
be
frozen
or
marketed
in
a
different
fashion,
eviscerated
poultry,
frozen
poultry,
when
they
began
to
freeze
the
vegetables,
the
berries
and
the
fruits,
his
operations
changed
or
his
come
--
his
equipment
changed
so
that
he
was
able
to
transport
them
in
this
new
form
or
in
this
changed
form.
and
he
purchased
refrigerated
equipment
and
substantial
quantities
for
a
trucker
considering
that
he
was
limited
to
only
transporting
those
things
exempt
from
the
commission's
economic
regulation.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
advertised
widely
prior
to
the
grandfather
date,
as
a
specialist
in
performing
this
kind
of
transportation.
and
on
may
1st,
1958,
the
grandfather
day,
he
was
a
very
substantial
trucker
of
this
exempt
agricultural
commodity.
he
was
operating
some
34
tractor
trailer
units.
that
is
the
combination,
34
of
them
specially
equipped
with
refrigeration
capable
of
transporting
the
frozen
fruit.
now,
he
was
holding
out
a
service
and
he's
advertising.
he
was
holding
out
a
service
in
his
actual
performance
where
his
trucks
were
over
a
very
broad
area.
he
filed
an
application
with
the
commission
when
this
--
under
the
grandfather
statute.
there
was
a
hearing
at
which
a
number
of
railroads
and
existing
regulated
truck
lines
intervened
and
protested
it.
there
was
an
examiner's
report
in
which
a
substantial
grant
beyond
that
which
is
now
before
this
court
in
the
form
of
the
order
of
the
commission
was
given
by
the
hearing
examiner.
the
matter
was
then
presented
to
the
commission
and
that
it
is
the
commission's
decision
that
is
here
and
has
been
affirmed
below.
now,
the
commission's
decision
and
the
interpretation
upon
which
we
--
which
this
case
rest
and
the
commission
errors
on
which
we
ask
this
court's
determination,
are
those
in
which
the
commission
sharply
limited
the
prior
operations
by
shaw
and
did
so
by
--
by
a
process
which
this
court
and
carolina
freight
carriers
called
a
pulverization
of
the
prior
operation.
and
the
result
if
you'll
look
at
the
record
is
to
distort
what
was
in
fact
a
unitary
and
integrated
operation
by
shaw
transporting
an
extremely
limited
number
of
commodities
over
a
very
broad
territory.
commodities
which
moreover
as
the
examiner
found
but
which
the
commission
never
mentioned
were
affected
by
climatic
crop
conditions
and
by
variations
which
necessity
of
the
type
of
commodity
that
you
have
were
affected
by
growing
seasons.
they
were
affected
by
a
whole
variety
of
events
over
which
certainly
the
carrier
had
no
control
and
a
whole
series
of
factors
involving
the
marketing
over
which
the
carrier
had
no
control
and
which
were
in
the
record.
now,
what
precisely
did
this
pulverization
or
atomization
as
the
court
in
carolina
said
happened
to
shaw?
what
did
they
do?
they
held
that
although
willis
shaw
was
a
common
carrier
and
a
common
carrier
by
motor
vehicle
within
a
substantial
territory
of
all
of
the
frozen
agricultural
commodities,
fruits,
berries
and
vegetables,
yet
they
took
certain
specific
points
in
certain
specific
areas
and
they
sharply
restricted
that
to
saying
only
take
fruit
from
this
point
to
that
point.
you
can
take
vegetables
from
this
point
to
that
point.
and
they
didn't
do
it
with
respect
to
different
points.
they
did
it
with
respect
to
the
same
points.
let
me
--
they're
the
same
origin
areas.
it
wasn't
a
question
of
what
was
grown
there.
let
me
give
you
a
specific
example
which
i
think
highlights
exactly
the
kind
of
commodity
treatment
to
which
willis
shaw
was
accorded
by
the
commission
below.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
found
that
willis
shaw
was
entitled
to
transport
frozen
fruits,
frozen
berries
and
frozen
vegetable
from
the
points
in
the
lower
peninsula
of
michigan
to
kansas
city,
missouri.
that's
all
of
the
frozen
commodities.
that's
the
whole
scope
of
those
made
subject
to
regulation.
but,
from
the
same
origin
area
of
the
lower
peninsula
of
michigan
to
st.
joseph,
missouri,
he
was
authorized
only
to
transport
frozen
fruit.
now,
how
did
they
get
that
way?
why
would
willis
shaw
transport
or
as
a
common
carrier
restrict
his
holding
out
to
the
public
in
the
lower
peninsula
of
michigan,
the
shippers
there,
to
transport
only
frozen
fruit
to
st.
joseph,
missouri,
a
few
miles
up
the
road
from
kansas
city
or
as
they
also
said,
you
can
only
transport
frozen
fruit
to
points
in
kansas
right
across
the
missouri
river
from
kansas
city,
missouri.
the
only
excuse
or
the
only
justification
given
in
the
commission's
report
is
that
they
tabulated
the
commodities
that
he
transported
in
what
they
considered
the
relevant
period
and
he
hadn't
transported
during
that
relevant
period
anything
but
frozen
fruit
from
the
lower
peninsula
of
michigan
to
st.
joseph,
missouri
or
the
points
in
kansas
but
had
transported
a
shipment
or
more
from
the
lower
peninsula
of
michigan
to
kansas
city.
there
was
no
consideration
given
to
his
status
as
a
common
carrier
as
this
court
held
the
act
required
in
19
--
in
the
carolina
case.
there
was
no
consideration
given
to
whether
the
--
that
he
--
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
he
was
a
common
carrier
of
all
of
those
commodities.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
all
--
all
of
the
refrigerated
--
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
--
exempt
commodity
--
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
of
course
--
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
well,
he
was
--
no
sir.
he
had
been
--
that's
the
way
he
was
created.
he
has
had
subs
--
obtained
certificate
subsequently.
but
at
the
time
we're
talking
about,
the
grandfather
period,
shaw
was
nothing
but
a
transporter
of
the
exempt
agricultural
commodities
which
required
refrigeration,
commodities
which
he
and
his
equipment
--
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
that's
right.
and
if
his
scope
was
from
the
lower
peninsula
of
michigan,
the
kansas
city
frozen
fruits,
berries
and
vegetables
were
all
that
they
sub
--
all
the
refrigerated
commodities
that
were
made
subject
to
regulate.
how
did
he
get
to
be
such
a
limited
common
carrier
for
the
purpose
of
going
to
st.
joseph,
missouri?
the
fact
is
that
he
did
not,
and
the
commission
didn't
make
any
finding
that
he
was
at
all
limited
in
he's
holding
out
to
the
public
or
that
shaw
took
the
slightest
difference.
the
fact
is
that
he
was
holding
out.
the
fact
is
that
he
was
available
for
service.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
may
it
please
the
court.
on
thursday,
i
pointed
out
that
this
appeal
involves
a
construction
and
application
of
the
transportation
act
of
1958
which
imposed
on
truck
transportation
of
certain
agricultural
commodities,
economic
regulation,
rate
and
operating
authority
regulation
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
but
which
directed
the
commission
to
issue
operating
authority
to
truckers
in
bona
fide
operation
on
may
1,
1958
over
any
route
or
routes
or
within
any
territory,
transporting
this
agricultural
commodity.
this
provision,
directing
the
issue
on
some
operating
rights,
was
designed
to
assure
that
these
previously
unregulated
truckers
could
continue
in
business.
i
also
pointed
out
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
interpreted
and
applied
this
statute
to
shaw,
the
appellant
here,
a
substantial
common
carrier
of
refrigerated
and
frozen
agricultural
commodities
so
as
to
limit
sharply
shaw's
future
operations
as
compared
with
his
prior
bona
fide
operation.
the
commission
did
this
by
ignoring
the
transportation
characteristics
of
the
frozen
fruits,
frozen
vegetables
and
frozen
berries
involved.
and
the
commission
wholly
ignored
the
scope
of
service,
actually
held
out
by
shaw.
the
commission
in
fact
refused
to
receive
or
consider
evidence
of
shaw's
ability
to
perform
on
the
ground
that
such
evidence
was
irrelevant
to
its
determination
under
the
statute
as
it
was
being
applied.
the
commission
fragmented
shaw's
prior
operations
into
a
series
of
disconnected
and
unrelated
shipments.
the
result
is
completely
unrelated
to
operating
reality
for
any
trucker.
the
commission
for
example,
would
permit
only
frozen
fruit
to
be
carried
to
some
points,
frozen
vegetables
to
others,
frozen
berries
to
still
others.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
yes,
they
--
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
that's
right,
the
commission
--
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
yes
it
is,
your
honor,
because
shaw
was
transporting,
for
example,
from
the
lower
peninsula
of
michigan.
the
commission
held
that
they
could
transport
frozen
fruits,
vegetables
and
berries
as
i
said
on
thursday,
to
a
point
such
as
kansas
city,
but
from
precisely
the
same
origin
point,
only
frozen
berries
to
say
saint
joseph,
missouri.
now,
this
is
entirely
unrealistic
to
any
trucker.
they
--
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
oh,
yes.
it
was
based
on
that
mere
fact
and
this
fact
alone
that
shaw
had
not
in
fact
during
the
period
of
the
commission
considered
relevant,
transported
a
shipment
of
frozen
vegetables
from
the
lower
peninsula
of
michigan
to
saint
joseph,
missouri.
in
the
carolina
freight
carriers
case,
this
court
said
that
that
kind
of
treatment
as
applied
to
a
common
carrier
was
a
misapplication
of
the
statutory
standards.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
i
think
they
--
they
could
restrict
into
the
areas
in
which
it
was
demonstrated
that
he
had
in
fact
served
geographically.
that
is
--
we'll
take
another
example
mr.
chief
justice.
take
it
--
take
the
point
that
he's
home
based
in
lower
--
in
fort
smith,
arkansas.
now,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
said
that
this
--
this
common
carrier
was
entitled
to
transport
frozen
vegetable
from
fort
smith,
arkansas
to
miami
and
jacksonville,
florida,
to
san
francisco,
california
frozen
--
frozen
berries
to
chicago,
illinois
and
frozen
vegetables
to
detroit,
michigan.
now,
it
would
be
impossible
to
have
a
more
fragmented
theory
of
any
common
carrier's
operation
to
have
points
so
far
separated
within
the
united
states
and
never
consider
the
intermediate
points
in
areas
to
which
a
carrier
must
necessarily
transport
these
products
in
order
to
get
to
jacksonville
or
miami,
florida.
for
example,
as
we
point
out
in
the
brief,
the
commission
wholly
ignored
the
fact
that
on
the
very
shipment
that
they
went
to
miami,
they
took
a
shipment
to
atlanta.
no
authority
was
given
to
transport
any
shipment
to
atlanta,
why
not?
no
trucker
would
ever
transport
failed
to
serve
intermediate
points
such
as
that,
intermediate
areas
such
as
that.
the
--
the
point
--
entire
theory
along
which
the
commission
proceeded
was
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
said.
they
took
a
list
of
what
he
did
in
1957
and
they
fragmented
its
future
operations
directly
to
that
list.
that,
as
i
suggested
to
the
court
on
thursday,
is
a
flatly
a
violation
of
the
statutory
interpretation
of
the
--
and
of
the
application
that
this
court
directed
a
similar
language
in
1935
in
the
carolina
case.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
--
because
obviously,
any
--
the
--
the
commission
has
the
--
has
the
right
and
the
authority
to
--
and
the
duty
--
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
--
to
look
at
what
the
--
what
the
carrier
was
in
act
--
fact
holding
out
to
serve
the
public.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
both.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
because
they're
both
involved.
mr.
chief
justice,
nobody's
business
is
solely
determined
on
how
many
sales
you
made
today.
its
how
many
sales
were
you
offering
to
make
today.
and
this
is
also
true
of
a
common
carrier
by
motor
vehicle.
a
common
carrier
doesn't
only
serve
solely
in
the
shipments
that
he
transports
today
or
in
any
period.
he
also
serves
by
holding
out
his
service.
the
availability
of
his
service
to
the
public
is
as
important
to
him
and
to
the
public
as
any
other
aspect
of
his
service.
he
may
not
be
used
today,
he
may
not
be
used
in
any
month
in
considering
the
seasonal
nature
and
the
variables
of
the
frozen
vegetables
here
involved
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
expected.
look
what
this
--
look
what
the
counsel,
trying
this
case,
attempted
to
do
in
which
the
commission
would
not
permit.
the
appellant
before
the
commission
showed
not
only
that
he
had
his
equipment.
he
showed
not
only
what
he
was
operating
during
the
particular
period
of
time
in
terms
of
equipment.
in
terms
of
his
advertising
to
the
public
of
where
he
said,
i
will
handle
it
for
you
if
you
will
give
it
to
me.
he
not
only
put
in
the
evidence
what
he
actually
had
transported.
he
put
into
evidence
this
exhibit
or
attempted
to
put
in
evidence
this
exhibit
but
the
commission
wouldn't
receive
it.
only
two
pages
of
this
exhibit
are
repeated
or
are
--
are
printed
in
the
transcript
of
record
because
it
wasn't
received
in
evidence.
now,
what
was
the
exhibit?
the
exhibit
was
an
attempt
on
his
part
to
show
that
he
had
empty
trucks
available
in
these
areas
for
which
he
solicited
the
business
of
transporting
frozen
fruits,
frozen
berries
and
frozen
vegetables.
how
else
would
he
able
to
show
that
he
had
been
holding
out
this
service?
how
else
would
he
show
as
this
court
suggested
he
should
show
in
(inaudible)
that
he
was
in
fact
able
to
perform
and
that
any
hiatus
in
his
service
was
not
an
occasion
where
he
had
limited
his
service
or
in
which
his
service
had
been
withheld
from
the
public
because
he
decided
to
transport
only
from
here
to
there.
but
because
of
factors
over
which
no
common
carrier
can
control,
that
is
whether
the
public
decide
to
use
his
service
today,
tomorrow
or
next
month.
and
--
and
you
will
not
find,
if
you
read
the
order
of
the
commission,
one
finding,
so
far
as
i
can
determine,
nothing
in
this
order
suggest
that
the
commission
gave
any
such
consideration
to
this
carrier's
operation.
it
was
a
mechanistic
production
by
which
they
attempted
to
give
him
on
arithmetical
majority
for
the
future
of
the
precise
shipments,
fragmented
as
they
were
that
he
had
transported
during
1957.
now,
the
--
this
order,
mr.
chief
justice
denies
to
shaw,
operating
rights
for
the
future
to
which
he
is
entitled.
but
he
does
more
than
deny
rights
to
willis
shaw.
he
also
denies
to
the
public
the
competing
operations
which
shaw
held
out.
and
as
i
have
told
you,
at
--
had
in
fact
available
in
the
form
of
empty
vehicles,
moved
from
that
point
because
at
that
time,
there
was
no
such
traffic
to
another
point
where
there
was
traffic,
considering
the
variations
involved,
and
it
denies
to
them
the
kinds
of
common
carrier
service
which
shaw
had
in
fact
available.
and
it
was
able
to
prove
in
the
form
of
this
refrigerated
truck
to
shippers
and
receivers
of
these
agricultural
products.
in
some,
it
denies
not
only
to
shaw
the
rights
to
which
the
statute
entitles
him
but
it
also
denies
to
the
shipping
public
in
a
form
of
competing
operations
which
shaw
had
available
in
fact
to
the
public
for
the
transportation
of
this
agricultural
commodity.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
a.
alvis
layne
there's
only
one
or
two
points
that
i'd
like
to
make,
your
honor.
first,
i'm
rather
surprised
by
the
argument
that
there's
something
different
about
the
1958
statute
than
the
1935
statutes
because
it
mentioned
the
word
"property".
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
1935,
congress
was
dealing
with
--
in
placing
regulation
on
all
motor
carrier
transportations
including
the
transportation
of
passengers
as
well
as
property,
and
therefore,
there
was
no
occasion
to
do
--
to
say
anything
about
property,
passengers,
or
otherwise.
in
the
statute
in
1958,
congress
was
solely
concerned,
was
returning
to
regulation
as
the
--
as
the
committee
put
it,
the
transportation
of
certain
property
and
therefore,
it
appropriately
used
as
a
--
the
word
property,
nothing.
it's
--
it's
the
only
way
in
which
congress
could
have
written
the
statute
in
the
same
terms
as
the
1935
statute.
also,
there
seems
to
be
some
suggestion
that
because
congress
used
the
words
frozen
fruits,
frozen
berries,
frozen
vegetables,
and
on
that
this
--
this
enables
the
commission
to
create
what
is
called
three
classifications.
there's
not
one
single
word
by
anybody
that
testified
before
congress
suggesting
that
anyone
in
the
industry
either
those
who
produce
this,
those
who
ship
these
products,
those
who
receive
them,
or
those
who
transported
them
considered
them
as
three
separate
kinds
of
classifications.
and
the
--
and
the
argument
about
wool,
noils
and
hemp
goes
a
little
too
far.
if
the
--
if
the
court
would
just
look
at
the
statute,
you'll
see
the
all
sale
--
said
wool
waste.
i
suppose
that
now
we'll
have
a
classification
of
wool,
noils,
and
tops,
but
wool
waste
is
a
separate
classification.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
transportation
of
these
frozen
items
had
precisely
the
same
transportation
characteristic.
they
were
--
and
that
is
the
controlling
matter
in
transportation,
we're
transported
in
the
same
kinds
of
vehicle.
they
had
to
be
equipped
with
the
--
for
the
same
kinds
of
transportation.
that's
what
makes
these
commodities
different
than
wool
or
coco
beans,
or
bananas,
and
the
other
items.
now,
finally,
it
is
said
that
because
somehow
there
is
these
limited
commodities
that
that
justifies
the
commission
in
being
more
restricted
in
its
treatment
of
an
applicant
than
they
were
in
1935.
they've
forgotten
that
the
court
in
carolina
pointed
out
very
properly
of
basic
economic
fact
to
the
transportation
industry
particularly
for
a
trucker.
when
you
have
a
limited
number
of
commodity,
you
must
have
a
broad
territory
upon
which
to
base
an
economically
viable
operation.
and
the
court
said
there
is
in
carolina
no
statutory
sanction
for
limiting
point-to-point
where
you
have
a
limited
group
of
commodity.
now,
as
to
whether
they
can
survive,
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
an
economically
viable
operation,
it's
true,
he
became
a
substantial
operator,
but
he
didn't
become
a
substantial
operator
by
rever
--
running
his
trucks
in
the
reversed
direction
in
going
west
bound
in
order
to
make
east
bound
movements.
no
one
could
survive
in
the
transportation
industry
doing
that
kind
of
thing.
and
i
gather
that
at
last
before
this
court,
the
commission
has
prepared
as
they
did
an
argument
apparently.
they
suggested
that
it's
not
what
they
really
intended,
but
that
is
what
they
did,
and
that
is
what
they
did
with
respect
to
the
fragmenting
of
the
commodities
too.
there
is
no
justification
for
saying
that
a
man
can
go
to
chicago
with
frozen
berries
and
he
can
go
to
detroit
with
frozen
vegetables
from
precisely
the
same
origin.
no
one
would
operate
a
truck
line
that
way
and
no
one
would
survive,
they
could.
this
judgment
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
