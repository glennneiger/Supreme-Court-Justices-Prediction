what
was
the

what
was
the
common
carrier
of?
justice

all
exempt
commodities.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
was
not
a
certificated
carrier
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
prior
at
the
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
equipment
--
he
was
a
special
kind
of
common
carrier
you
say
and
the
problem
is
what
were
the
scope
of
his
common
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
that
the
rule
of
law,
the
commission
was
bound
to
allow
the
trucker
or
these
applicants
to
carry
berries
only
to
the
point
that
it
has
previously
carried
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
a
matter
of
evidence,
is
it?
and
that's
a
--
re
--
really
a
question
of
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
an
issue
here
about
that
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
carried
berries
to
chicago
and
saint
louis
and
saint
joseph,
those
are
the
only
points
to
which
this
carrier
was
entitled
the
authority
to
carry
barriers
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
carry
berries?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you're
going
to
carry
the
berries
to
san
francisco,
do
you
think
it's
--
that
it's
quite
enough
that
the
commission
to
say
from
michigan
to
california,
but
not
to
any
point
in
between
michigan
and
san
francisco.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
rule
do
you
suppose
--
do
you
think
the
commission
followed
in
deciding
routes
or
areas?

white
yes.

in
giving
grandfather
further
rights
in
this
area
or
is
this
the
first
case
in
which
it
has
arisen.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
know
mr.
pollak,
if
--
if
a
carrier
isn't
applying
for
authority
in
the
207,
ever
asked
for
just
authority
to
transport
frozen
vegetables
for
example,
compared
with
the
frozen
fruits?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
a
--
that
will
result
of
a
--
of
the
restrictions
here
or
in
the
limited
nature
of
the
authority,
necessarily
resulted
empty
back
hauls
for
this
carrier,
do
you
know?
