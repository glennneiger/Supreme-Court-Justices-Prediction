mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
a
carrier
of
commodities
made
non-exempt
by
the
transportation
act
of
1958,
frozen
fruits,
frozen
berries,
frozen
vegetables,
ham,
coffee
beans
or
others
of
the
11,
may
obtain
authority
to
carry
those
commodities
in
two
ways.
he
may
apply
under
section
207
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
showing
a
need
for
the
service
and
the
fitness
to
carry
the
commodities.
he
may
also
apply
for
grandfather
rights,
provided
he
may
show
that
as
a
carrier,
he
was
in
bona
fide
operation
carrying
the
particular
commodities
on
the
grandfather
date
and
thereafter.
this
case
arose
on
applicant
shaw's
application
for
grandfather
rights
to
carry
frozen
fruits,
frozen
berries
and
frozen
vegetables
and
fish
and
mixed
loads
with
those
commodities
to
and
from
35
states.
this
court,
in
the
cases
interpreting
the
grandfather
clause
in
the
1935
motor
carrier
act,
which
first
imposed
economic
regulation
of
motor
carriers,
this
court
stated
that
it
did
not
sit
to
weigh
the
evidence
to
determine
the
scope
of
the
bona
fide
operations
of
the
carrier.
that
is
a
function
which
had
been
assigned
by
congress,
this
court
recognized
to
this
commerce
commission.
the
questions,
the
court
said
there
for
the
commission,
are
whether
the
service
within
a
territory
is
sufficiently
representative
to
warrant
the
calling
of
it
bona
fide
operations
and
whether
the
coverage
of
particular
commodities
is
sufficiently
represented
to
constitute
such
operations.
the
answer
this
court
made
clear
as
to
these
questions
is
for
the
commission,
and
the
court
sets
to
determine
whether
the
commission
in
reviewing
the
mass
of
evidence
is
applying
the
correct
legal
standards
and
that,
there
are
two
legal
standards
which
are
taken
by
this
court
in
this
case
for
review.
first,
the
question
whether
in
determining
the
extent
of
shaw's
bona
fide
operations
on
and
after
the
grandfather
date,
the
commission
and
the
court
properly
treated
frozen
fruits,
frozen
berries
and
frozen
vegetables
as
separate
commodity
classifications.
so
that
a
prescriptive
right
to
carry
or
to
continue
operations
in
a
particular
commodity
class,
frozen
vegetables
for
example,
would
be
obtained
by
showing
prior
carriage
of
frozen
vegetables.
the
second
issue,
second
legal
issue
is
whether
in
determining
the
extent
of
bona
fide
operations
on
may
1,
1958,
the
commission
properly
refused
to
consider
evidence
of
operations
prior
to
january
1,
1957.
considering
such
evidence
is
too
remote
to
bear
on
the
scope
of
bona
fide
operations
16
months
later.
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
your
honor.
i
believe
that
if
the
court
--
the
court
rev
--
the
court
wishes
to
review
the
treatment
of
the
evidence
by
the
commission.
and
if
we
have
made
such
a
review
in
our
appendices,
i
think
it
will
find
that
within
the
rules
of
law
they
were
applying,
the
carrier
here
received
a
--
indeed
a
liberal
treatment
of
its
prior
operations.
after
all,
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
no,
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
too
limited
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
that's
right.
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
think
that
their
--
had
the
commission
failed
to
give
proper
effect
to
the
evidence
and
where
there
were
a
representative,
as
the
court
said
in
carolina
carriers,
where
there
was
a
representative
carrying
commodities
to
a
number
of
points
where
it
pointed
out
that
the
--
those
points
should
authorize
the
carrier
in
the
future
to
give
statewide
authority
and
the
commission
had
not
reflected
that
in
its
order,
i
think
the
court
might
have
an
issue
but
i
--
i
believe
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no
i
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
would
say
no.
if
the
carrying
as
sufficiently
frequent
and
representative,
then
it
would
be
entitled
to
a
statewide
authority
for
example,
to
area
authority
and
that
is
what
the
commission
has
done.
in
its
--
the
scope
of
the
grant
made
by
the
commission
is
written
out
at
page
7
of
our
brief.
and
it
indicates
there
that
the
grant
was
to
carry
all
three
commodities
from
several
states
to
several
other
states.
now,
the
evidence
did
not
show
that
the
carrier
transported
those
three
commodities
to
every
town
in
those
states
but
the
commission
said
and
it
--
if
the
record
in
page
339,
it
indicated
the
rule
that
it
applied.
it
said,
"for
example,
there
is
recorded
a
total
of
about
15
shipments
from
several
california
origins
to
several
nebraska
origins,
including
omaha,
which
sufficiently
establishes
a
pattern
of
statewide
operations
in
transporting
these
commodities."
and
you
would
see
that
the
commission
there
granted
statewide
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
i
think
that
that
is
inherent
in
the
concept
of
the
grandfather
operations.
what
congress
provided
was
that
the
scope
of
future
authority
would
be
tailored
to
substantial
parity
with
prior
operations.
now,
the
point
was
made
in
the
course
of
argument
that
the
--
of
this
transportation
from
arkansas
to
florida
of
vegetables
and
there's
no
reflection.
i
--
i
might
say
in
interrupting
that,
i
think
this
is
not
an
issue
here
for
the
court
but
if
you
look
at
the
evidence,
the
point
was
made
that
the
transportation
was
from
flor
--
arkansas
to
florida
of
vegetables
and
that
--
and
the
intermediate
point
in
georgia
was
not
granted
to
--
the
evidence
shows
that
there
was
no
carriage
to
an
intermediate
point
from
arkansas
to
georgia,
the
intermediate
point,
after
the
grandfather
date.
now,
the
congress
has
said
that
the
carriage
must
be
on
the
grandfather
date
and
thereafter.
and
the
congress,
i
think
in
the
cases
of
the
court,
indicate
that
the
commission
is
charged
with
looking
at
the
evidence
in
determining
what
that
carriage
was.
and
here,
i
think
within
the
rules
of
law
that
we've
recognized
are
before
the
court,
the
commission
properly
weighed
the
evidence.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
what
rule?
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
think
the
rule
that
it
applied
was
to
review
where
the
trips
were
and
with
which
products.
and
if
there
were
a
representative,
number
of
trips
to
an
area,
an
area-wide
authority
was
granted.
if
there
were
representative
trips
with
commodities,
then
commodity
authority
was
granted.
and
indeed,
i
read
its
opinion
to
say
that
where
it
granted
--
one
where
it
found
evidence
of
shipment
of
one
commodity
class,
frozen
vegetables,
that
it
would
look
rather
closely
to
see
if
it
could
not
find
shipments
of
the
other
classes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
and
if
it
did
not
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
sir.
it
primary
--
it
did
it
by
states
and
indeed
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
although
it
did
state
that
it
would
grant
originating
authority
form
california,
oregon
and
washington
because
commodities
appeared
to
flow
from
those
three
producing
states,
fruits,
berries,
vegetables,
frozen.
two,
and
it
named
for
other
sates,
so
it
may
have
looked
at
those
as
a
group
of
states.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes
it
--
oh,
yes.
i
don't
mean
to
be
unders
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
the
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
the
justification
for
that
is
i
think
a
review
of
the
evidence
if
before
the
grandfather
date
or
on
the
grandfather
date,
there
is
a
transportation
from
little
rock
to
saint
joseph,
missouri.
and
there
are
no
other
transportations
before
and
maybe
one
after
between
the
same
points,
i
think
the
commission,
consistent
with
the
decisions
of
this
court,
may
grant
authority
between
those
two
points.
after
all,
the
carriers
may
apply
under
207
for
authority
showing
need.
and
this
is
only
to
let
them
continue
prior
operations,
prior
bona
fide
operations.
indeed,
in
the
carolina
carriers
case
--
i
--
i'm
sorry,
i
think
it's
the
howard
hall
case,
in
the
volume
315.
i
think
it's
significant
to
note
that
there;
there
was
a
claim
in
that
case.
the
commission
granted
authority
from
birmingham,
alabama
to
certain
points.
and
it
limited
the
authority
from
birmingham
to
a
radius
of
10
miles
around
birmingham.
the
contention
was
made
that
it
should've
granted
an
originating
authority
from
a
radius
of
a
hundred
miles
around
birmingham.
and
this
court,
in
its
opinion,
that
498
reviewed
that
evidence
and
said
that
there
were
only
55
shipments
from
the
area
beyond
10
miles
and
within
the
hundred-mile
radius
whereas
there
were
a
larger
number,
875
within
the
area.
then
it
said,
"after
the
grandfather
date,
there
were
270
shipments
from
the
area
between
10
miles
and
a
hundred-mile
radius."
the
commission
--
the
court
said
that
it
was
for
the
commission
to
weigh
that
evidence
and
although
it
was
granting
no
authority
to
reflect
55
shipments
from
the
area
between
10
miles
and
a
hundred
miles,
granting
no
authority
to
reflect
270
shipments
after
the
grandfather
date.
that
was
a
decision
for
the
commission
and
this
court
was
approving
there
a
point-to-point
authority.
i
think
that
--
that
is
a
--
responsive
to
your
question.
in
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
don't
think
i
would
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
we
do,
your
honor.
and
in
fact,
we
find
right
in
the
words
chosen
by
commerce
later
on,
wool
tops
and
noils.
they
didn't
say
"wool
tops,
wool
noils."
what
they
said,
"wool
tops
and
noils."
and
we
would
assume
that
if
you
transported
a
load
of
wool
tops,
you'd
get
authority
for
wool
noils.
but
here,
where
the
commission
took
the
seriatim
listing,
frozen
fruits,
frozen
berries
and
frozen
vegetables,
we
read
that
to
mean
that
each
of
those
is
a
separate
commodity
class.
and
indeed,
let's
not
--
it
should
be
recognized
that
frozen
vegetables
is
a
commodity
class.
if
the
carrier
transports
black-eyed
peas,
georgia
to
wyoming,
the
carrier
will
obtain
authority
for
frozen
vegetables.
there's
no
question
here
that
the
commission
denied
him
authority
to
carry
frozen
cauliflower,
collards
or
brussels
sprouts
or
something
like
that.
he
got
full
commodity
class
authority.
we
don't
see
that
in
his
argument
that
this
is
a
--
a
single
class,
why
or
how
he
can
make
a
distinction
that
if
you
carry
frozen
fruits,
you
shouldn't
also
get
authority
to
carry
him
for
wool
tops.
indeed,
reading
the
legislative
history,
there's
no
suggestion
that
the
three
are
part
of
a
single
class.
the
congress
in
its
--
in
the
conference
report
and
each
of
the
reports
of
the
senate
and
house
committees,
carries
a
paragraph
describing
the
grandfather
rights,
and
i'm
quoting,
"any
person
engaged
on
may
1,
1958,
in
trucking
the
aforementioned
commodities
which
are
returned
to
regulation
by
this
amendment,
would
be
permitted
upon
application
to
a
certificate
or
permit
allowing
him
under
regulation
to
continue
transportation
of
the
same
commodities
within
the
same
areas
for
the
same
points.
now,
the
only
reasonable
reading
that
we
can
see
of
that
is
that
this
is
a
class-to-class
relationship.
there
are
11
classes
listed.
if
you
transported
one
commodities
in
one
class
within
an
area
or
from
point-to-to
point
and
you
show
it,
then
you'll
get
authority
for
that
commodity.
we
don't
believe
that
the
carolina
carriers
case
at
all
is
contrary
to
the
decision
reached
by
the
commission
and
the
court
below.
in
that
case,
the
court,
this
court
set
aside
a
commission
decision,
saying
it
had
itemized
prior
transportation.
but
the
facts
and
the
wording
of
the
1935
statute
are
very
different
and
importantly
so.
there,
the
common
carrier
was
a
carrier
of
general
commodities.
general
commodities
is
a
class,
was
recognized
by
a
class.
what
the
commission
did
in
weighing
the
evidence
there,
it
found
that
there
had
been
representative
transportation
of
particular
commodities
within
the
general
commodity
class
and
it
granted
authority
limited
to
those
commodities
within
the
class.
it's
again
as
if
there
had
been
transportation
of
the
black-eyed
peas
and
the
grant
here
had
been
limited
to
black-eyed
peas.
and
the
commission
said,
"there
shall
not
be
itemization."
it
meant
that
if
you
--
that
the
--
pardon
me.
when
the
court
said,
"there
shall
not
be
itemization",
it
meant
that
where
you
find
representative
shipments
of
commodities
within
a
class,
the
grant
shall
be
--
for
the
entire
class.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
both
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
no.
if
i
understand
you
there,
the
question
of
--
of
whether
that
these
are
separate
classes,
these
three
frozen
fruits,
frozen
berries
and
frozen
vegetables.
they
have
been
consistently
interpreted
as
separate
classes
by
the
commission.
but
it
has
been
tested
in
the
courts
and
the
commission
has
been
affirmed
except
in
the
winter
garden
case
and
in
that
case,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
the
shipments
were
from
the
--
court
found
on
the
facts
that
the
shipments
originated
fruits,
berries
and
vegetables
all
from
the
same
location,
same
warehouse.
and
therefore,
the
question
that
the
separate
commodity
has
really
been
derived,
although
the
court
had
statements
in
its
opinion
saying
it
--
which
would
be
read
as
indicating
these
are
separate
classes.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
i
--
i
can't
answer.
i
would
assume
they
probably
asked
for
more
authority
than
that.
although,
mr.
justice
white,
there
are
many
areas
of
the
country
where
only
frozen
vegetables
maybe
grown
and
i
would
assume
that
from
that
particular
area,
or
a
processing
area,
they
probably
would
ask
for
a
limited
authority.
after
--
after
all,
the
--
a
review
of
the
evidence
here
shows
that
in
those
--
in
the
example
of
the
arkansas
authority
which
was
here
granted.
in
the
--
a
complaint
is
made
that
it
wasn't
for
three
commodities.
but
a
review
of
the
evidence
showed
that
there
were
--
in
the
period
before
and
after
the
grandfather
right
which
the
statute
required,
they
didn't
transport
the
three
commodities.
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
well,
i
don't
--
i
really
don't
know.
i
don't
know.
he
has
been
operating
and
the
--
the
counsel
has
suggested
a
substantial
operation
since
1938.
and
i
think
the
commission
has
taken
into
consideration
in
this
vast
exhibit
which
starts
at
205
and
runs
to
323
listing
5000
shipments.
the
commission
has
taken
all
those
into
consideration
and
we
reviewed
the
evidence.
there's
a
question
here
whether
prior
to
1957
should've
been
taken
into
consideration.
we've
reviewed
that
evidence
and
it
doesn't
show
that
it
would've
enlarged
the
authority.
the
commission
has
taken
all
those
shipments
into
consideration
where
the
carrier
who
has
been
successful,
its
financial
status
seems
to
be
improving,
its
number
of
trucks
and
trailers
is
growing,
the
record
shows.
and
i
would
say
that
since
it's
taken
all
shipments
into
consideration,
it's
not
going
to
suffer
empty
back
hauls.
either
--
either
it
did
--
it
had
empty
back
hauls
in
the
years
passed
and
they
weren't
reflected
in
the
shipments
or
it
didn't
have
them.
but
to
the
extent
that
the
back
hauls
were
not
empty,
they've
been
taken
into
consideration
to
the
extent
they
were
empty.
this
was
a
problem
that
they
had
in
the
past
and
has
been
very
economically
successful
carrier.
i
--
i
would
say
that
on
the
basis
of
the
record,
i
don't
know.
now,
the
--
the
point
--
when
the
argument
was
made
that
a
holding
out
should
be
sufficient,
i
think
that
the
statements
of
the
court
in
the
carolina
carriers
case
are
quite
specific
that
a
holding
out
is
not
sufficient.
the
court
there
said
that
it
makes
clear
that
a
holding
out
to
serve
a
specified
area
is
not
alone
sufficient.
it's
actual
rather
potential
or
simulated
service
which
is
required.
the
point
later
it
said,
"it
is
plain
that
a
carrier's
holding
out
an
actual
performance
maybe
limited
to
a
few
articles
only."
i
might
mention,
i
said
that
the
1935
statute
differed
--
it
--
from
the
1958
grandfather
statute
in
this
material
way.
the
1935
statute
which
is
quoted
at
page
20
of
our
brief
required
only
that
the
carrier
be
in
bona
fide
operation
as
a
common
carrier
over
roots
and
within
the
territory.
the
statute
which
this
court
is
asked
to
interpret
in
this
case,
the
1958
statute
makes
--
which
is
quoted
at
page
38
of
the
brief
says,
"in
bona
fide
operation,
and
i'm
skipping
some
of
the
words,
in
the
transportation
of
property
over
roots
and
within
territories."
so
this
grandfather
clause
makes
specific
reference
to
the
transportation
of
property.
indeed
it
might
be
suggested
that
under
the
35
law,
the
--
a
common
carrier
could
have
gotten
authority
to
transport
any
commodity
because
the
statute,
at
least
the
grandfather
provision
didn't
refer
to
the
property
being
carried.
it
only
required
being
in
operation
as
a
common
carrier.
the
court
found
the
necessity
for
limitations
on
the
property
carried
in
the
definition
of
what
a
common
carrier
was,
which
was
in
the
statute.
we
think
it
is
equally
plain
your
honors,
that
the
commission
properly
drew
a
line
on
january
1,
1957
to
exclude
evidence
prior
to
that
time.
this
is
precisely
the
type
of
reasonable,
administrative
ruling
that
the
congress
left
to
the
commission.
the
congress
said
that
the
carrier
must
be
in
bona
fide
operation
on
may
1,
1958.
and
since
that
time,
it
left
to
the
commission
the
period
of
operations
prior
to
may
1
to
consider
is
relevant.
consider
the
problem
--
the
administrative
problem,
there
were
some
900
applications
for
grandfather
authority.
shaw
was
one
of
those
applicants.
shaw
submitted
to
the
commission
in
its
table,
exhibit
22,
5000
shipments
running
from
may
1954
to
october
1957,
asked
the
commission
to
consider
all
of
these
shipments
and
to
tailor
its
grandfather
authority
accordingly.
if
every
one
of
the
other
900
carriers
submitted
a
similar
number
of
shipments
over
a
similar
length
of
time,
we're
talking
about
5
million
shipments
from
various
points
to
various
subjects.
the
commission
in
its
rule
of
law
in
this
case
said
only
that
we
will
look
at
your
evidence
back
to
january
1,
1957,
and
we
will
consider
that
evidence
relevant
of
the
scope
of
your
operations
on
may
1,
1958.
if
you
wish
us
to
consider
evidence
prior
to
may
1,
1957,
you
must
show
by
substantial
evidence
that
it
is
relevant.
in
a
review
of
the
record
indicates
that
although
there
was
a
--
there
is
statements
by
shaw
that
locations
of
food
processing
or
frozen
fruit
processing
stations
vary
and
moved
around.
there
was
no
indication
that
we
found
in
looking
at
the
prior
evidence
that
the
commission
in
considering
evidence
from
january
1,
1957
to
may
1,
1958,
didn't
get
a
fully
representative
picture
of
what
this
carriers
operations
were.
we
reviewed
in
appendix
c
of
our
brief
this
prior
evidence
which
the
commission
did
not
take
into
consideration,
and
it
shows
that
review
that
a
representative
picture
was
presented.
indeed,
the
statute
says
that
in
operations
after
the
grandfather
date,
there
must
be
uninterrupted
operations.
and
the
commission
has,
i
think,
reasonably
looked
to
a
certain
period
of
time
prior
to
the
grandfather
date
and
said,
"if
your
operations
do
not
come
through
loud
and
clear
in
that
16
month
period,
well
then
your
--
your
operations
have
a
gap
and
you
will
either
got
to
explain
to
us
why
they're
not
shown
in
the
16
month
period
prior
to
the
date
or
we
won't
consider
them."
and
indeed
the
commission
has
considered
in
the
cases
operations
more
remote
in
16
months,
one
case,
albert
getty,
which
was
cited.
the
president
of
the
carrier
had
been
in
an
--
in
an
accident
and
had
--
and
had
to
terminate
some
of
its
operations
on
--
on
recovery
and
also
on
getting
financially
rearranged.
and
where
that
was
shown,
the
commission
looked
at
a
--
at
more
ancient
history.
but
where
such
a
substantial
showing
isn't
made
and
we
don't
believe
that
it's
made
here,
why
16
months
is
enough.
indeed,
in
the
alton
case
before
this
court,
that
was
a
17
month
period.
the
alton
case
was
involving
the
1935
statute.
mentioning
just
briefly
the
question
which
is
raised
here
on
frozen
fish
and
mixed
clothes,
the
complaint,
as
we
understand
the
brief,
is
that
the
commissions
tailoring
of
the
authority
would
preclude
this
type
of
operation
picking
up
the
fish
at
a
seaport,
moving
it
inland
and
mixing
--
mixing
the
fish
with
the
frozen
foods
or
berries
at
an
inland
point.
i'm
authorized
to
say
by
the
commission
that
the
authority
granted,
which
was
set
out
at
page
7
of
the
brief,
that
the
authority
granted
and
the
commission's
judgment
does
not
preclude
that
type
of
operation.
and
if
the
--
of
course
if
the
carrier
is
in
doubt
as
to
whether
the
operation
of
mixing
it
an
inland
point
under
this
authority
is
precluded,
why
it
may
still
ask
the
commission
to
reopen
the
grandfather
proceeding.
i'm
advised
that
the
grandfather
proceedings
back
under
the
1935
statute
are
still
being
reopened
so
that
--
mr.
stephen
j.
pollak
no,
it
is
not.
we
--
we
think,
i
might
say
mr.
justice
that
we
believe
that
the
tailoring
of
the
authority
that
the
commission
made
here
is
inline
with
the
prior
operations
of
frozen
fish
and
mixed
loads
that
were
shown.
there
is
no
evidence
as
we
find
it
in
the
record
and
i've
looked
rather
hard.
there's
no
evidence
that
this
mixing
occurred
at
the
inland
point.
so
the
commission
gave
authority
from
the
seaport
on
the
kansas
city
and
we
think
it
properly
waived
the
evidence.
we
respectfully
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
below.
