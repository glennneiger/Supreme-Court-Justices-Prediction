mr.
william
i.
siegel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
learned
and
respected
friend
has
made
a
statement
that
there
is
some
significance
in
the
fact
that
a
great
volume
of
a
litigation
coming
from
--
involving
coerced
confessions
comes
from
new
york
to
this
court.
now,
within
the
last
20
years,
approximately,
this
court,
to
the
best
of
my
recollection,
has
considered
only
four
such
cases.
the
first
was
the
malinski
case.
and
i
have
a
very
definite
recollection
of
that
because
i
retried
malinski
after
this
court
reversed
the
judgment
on
the
ground
of
a
coerced
confession.
the
next
was
the
leyra
case.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
in
the
trial?
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
we
couldn't
use
the
confession,
your
honor.
and
the
state's
principal
witness
on
the
first
trial
who
was
a
very
degraded
character,
a
--
a
convict,
i
forget
his
name,
who
was
malinski's
brother-in-law,
and
who
had
implicated
him
outside
of
the
confession
recanted.
so
we
didn't
have
the
confession,
we
didn't
have
this
witness,
and
the
jury
naturally
acquitted
him.
the
second
case
was
the
leyra
case.
and
i
have
an
even
more
pertinent
and
personal
recollection
of
that
because
i
argued
the
case
in
this
court.
and
there
too,
the
court
reversed
the
judgment
because
of
a
coerced
confession.
and
perhaps
to
anticipate
a
question,
we
retried
leyra,
but
we
didn't
have
the
confession
in
that
case.
the
jury
convicted
him
anyway.
this
made
three
juries
which
had
found
him
guilty
but
our
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
dismissed
the
indictment.
the
third
case
was
the
--
the
stein
case
to
which
i
will
refer
more
at
length
later.
and
the
fourth
case
was
the
spano
case.
in
stein,
the
court
affirmed.
in
spano,
the
court
reversed.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
in
spano?
i
think,
sir,
that
he
pleaded
guilty
to
a
lesser
crime.
it
wasn't
our
case,
it
came
from
the
bronx.
only
the
first
two
were
ours.
i
find
(inaudible)
in
the
fact
that
in
leyra,
which
i
argued
there
was
a
strong
dissent
by
three
members
of
the
court.
so
that
there
is
not
this
preponderance
of
litigation
from
new
york
to
which
my
friend
has
referred.
he
makes
this
statistical
claim
or
i
should
say,
perhaps,
it
has
a
statistic.
our
record
in
this
court
is
not
very
impressive.
and
from
new
york,
there
are
three
reversals
and
one
affirmance,
but
i
don't
cite
these
facts
as
a
statistic.
i
cite
them
because
of
their
pertinence
and
relevance
to
the
first
argument
which
professor
collins
makes
to
wit
that
not
only
is
the
new
york
procedure
in
testing
out
the
voluntariness
of
confession,
unkind
to
defendants.
it
is
unconstitutional.
now,
in
malinski
and
in
leyra
and
in
spano,
no
point
was
raised
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
procedure.
but
in
stein,
it
very
definitely
was
raised.
and
mr.
justice
jackson
wrote
at
length
on
the
subject.
and
your
honors
will
find
quotations
from
his
opinion,
which
i,
of
course,
admire
very
much,
scattered
throughout
my
brief.
and
counsel
has
just
conceded
here
in
argument
that
the
court
found
in
--
in
stein,
found
in
new
york
procedure
to
be
a
proper
one,
unobjectionable
from
any
point
of
view
--
of
view,
and
he
has
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
asking
this
court
in
effect
to
reverse
on
it.
it
is,
i
think,
noteworthy
that
he
doesn't
cite
a
single
judicial
authority
for
that
point.
and
that
he
has
constrained
to
cite
only
the
writings
of
text
writers
and
of
learned
professors
of
the
law,
whose
authority
to
speak
generally,
i
--
i,
of
course,
do
not
attack,
but
whose
practical
experience
in
the
field
is
open
to
question.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
have
no
statistics,
your
honor.
they
--
there
are
more
than
one
i
would
say.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no.
i
think
my
friend
would
concede
that.
that
there's
anything
inherently
unfair
in
the
system,
i
do
not
believe.
i've
tried
cases.
i've
tried
cases
for
many
years
before
i
began
to
argue
on
the
questions
of
law.
i've
seen
jury's
concern
with
--
with
confession
cases
who
have
acquitted
defendants.
i
can't
give
you
a
statistic
on
that
either,
but
i
think
it
is
fair
to
sum
up
professor
collin's
position
and
the
position
of
those
legal
scholars
in
whom
we
he
finds
his
support
in
his
conflict,
that
it
is
based
on
a
deep
pervasive
and
underlying
fear
and
disbelief
and
distrust
of
the
jury
system.
now,
this
court
had
occasion
to
write
in
leland
against
oregon,
in
addition
to
stein
against
new
york,
where
the
specific
question
of
confession
was
involved.
this
court
had
occasioned
to
write
not
too
long
ago
in
344
u.s.
juries
have
for
centuries
made
the
basic
decision
between
guilt
and
innocence
and
between
criminal
responsibility
and
legal
insanity
upon
the
basis
of
the
facts
as
revealed
by
all
the
evidence
and
the
law,
as
explained
by
instructions
detailing
the
legal
distinctions,
placement
and
weight
of
the
burden
of
proof,
the
effect
of
presumptions,
the
meaning
of
intent,
etcetera.
we
think
to
condemn
the
operation
of
this
system
here
would
be
to
condemn
the
system
generally.
we
are
not
prepared
to
do
so,
and
it
is
our
answer
almost
in
some
to
the
contention
on
the
first
point
that
nothing
has
been
shown
in
this
case
to
cause
this
court
to
change
its
opinion
expressed
in
the
leland
case,
in
the
culombe
case,
in
rogers
against
richmond
and
stein
against
new
york
that
the
jury
system
of
trying
out
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession
is
both
proper
and
workable
and
constitutional.
that
it
--
that
the
system
operated
to
the
detriment
of
this
defendant
in
the
final
verdict
and
judgment.
so,
of
course,
no
argument
at
all
because
there
was
a
plentitude
of
--
of
evidence
in
this
case
of
guilt
outside
of
the
confessions,
and
i
will
have
to
refer
to
that
in
brief
in
a
moment
or
two.
but
to
summarize
our
position,
there
is
no
warrant
either
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
or
in
the
constitution
itself
to
compel
this
court
to
say
that
a
particular
method
of
trying
a
question
of
fact
is
unconstitutional.
my
friend
speaks
of
the
stein
decision
as
the
stein
aberration.
now,
i
think
he
is
not
--
he
is
not
really
referring
to
this
aspect
of
the
stein
case
at
all.
and
that
which
caused
the
dissent
in
stein
was
the
intimation,
although
i
don't
find
that
it
was
a
holding
that
if
there
was
other
and
sufficient
credible
evidence
of
guilt,
the
fact
that
an
involuntary
confession
had
been
admitted
would
not
void
the
judgment.
well,
this
court
has
made
it
clear
in
spano
and
other
cases
that
that
is
not
the
law,
and
that
is
not
the
point
that's
involved
here
in
this
case.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
there
are
--
there
some
cases
where
that
is
so
in
libel.
in
libel
our
statute
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
--
specifically
provides
and
i've
never
seen
an
attack
on
that.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no,
your
honor.
i'm
arguing
just
the
other
way
around.
i'm
not
concerned
with
the
case
with
that
point
because
the
issue
hasn't
been
raised.
i
am
arguing
that
as
long
as
proper
safeguards
are
thrown
around
a
defendant,
a
jury
may,
under
a
state
constitution
and
federally
constitutionally
pass
on
all
questions
of
fact
involving
the
very
awesome
ultimate
question
of
guilt
or
innocence.
if
it
may
pass
on
guilt
or
innocence,
i
can't
see
why
it
can't
pass
on
subsidiary
questions
provided
that
proper
safeguards.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
don't
intend
to
say
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
can
be
solved,
but
i
don't
intend
to
say
so
because
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
my
argument.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
not
all
lawyers.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
not
all
lawyers.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
if
a
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
our
procedure
--
i
--
i
had
thought
the
court
was
familiar
with
it,
our
procedure
in
summary
is
this,
the
confession
is
offered
on
behalf
of
the
people.
the
defendant
may
then,
through
counsel,
object
to
it
and
ask
for
a
preliminary
voir
dire.
he
doesn't
have
to.
this
is
(inaudible)
but
he
certainly
has
this
important
right.
or
you
may
wait
and
cross-examine
on
the
subject.
if
he
wants
a
voir
dire,
he
may
have
it
in
the
presence
of
a
jury
or
not
in
the
presence
of
a
jury.
usually,
it's
done
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
but
i
am
very
certain
that
if
a
request
were
made
that
the
jury
be
excluded,
it
would
be
granted
even
though
that
would
involve
trying
the
issue
of
voluntariness
twice.
if,
after
all,
the
evidence
is
in
and
the
defendant,
if
he
wishes,
may
call
witnesses
on
the
issue
of
voluntariness,
he
may
even
take
the
stand
on
that
issue,
although
if
he
does,
he
subjects
himself
to
general
cross-examination.
when
all
of
the
evidence
is
in,
if
the
court
must
say
that
no
reasonable
men
could
differ
on
the
issue
of
involuntariness,
then
the
court
must,
as
a
matter
of
law,
exclude
the
confession.
if
on
the
other
hand,
reasonable
men,
with
normal
mentality
and
normal
probity,
can
disagree
on
this
subject,
then
it
must
go
to
the
jury
with
proper
instructions
as
to
the
necessity
of
complete
voluntariness.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
at
the
moment,
in
my
own
experience,
i
remember
one.
now
of
course,
your
honor,
there
--
there
are
not
too
many
cases
were
confessions
are
involved
out
of
the,
let's
say
6000
indictments
which
we've
had
to
get
in
brooklyn
this
past
year.
i
would
say
that
90%
of
them
are
disposed
of
by
plea
or
dismissal
or
something
like
that.
and
of
the
remaining
600
or
so,
not
all
of
them
have
confessions
that
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
very
few.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
very
few.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
but
this
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no,
i
think
it's
discretionary.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
think
it's
discretionary.
i
--
i
don't
really
remember
any
request
at
all,
but
i
am
very
certain,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
the
request
can
be
made,
and
it
would
be
a
capricious
judge,
i
think,
who
would
reject
the
request.
and
even
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
--
if
he
did,
it
would
be
in
the
exercise
of
judiciary
discretion,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
--
i
am
sure
that
that
would
not
be
an
--
an
abuse
of
discretion
because
the
defendant
has
an
opportunity
to
test
out
the
question.
and
since
the
question
must
eventually
go
to
the
jury
anyway,
i
don't
see
that
he
is
harmed
by
having
the
confession
tried
out
preliminarily
and
then
other
proceedings.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that's
true.
that
is
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
can't,
your
honor.
standing
here,
i
mean
these
cases
come,
and
they
go,
and
i
don't
try
them
all.
i
just
remember
those
that
are
particularized
for
a
point.
but
i
think
it
happens.
now,
the
second
and
third
points
in
petitioner's
brief
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that's
correct.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
the
question
of
credibility
of
witnesses
is
always
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
and
he
instructs
them
on
that.
i
might
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
court
below
paid
the
instructions
in
this
case
on
the
question
of
voluntariness,
the
complement
of
speaking
very
highly.
and
as
i
recall,
i
think
our
court
of
appeals,
our
state
court
of
appeals
did
the
same
thing.
incidentally,
your
honors,
i
have
here
a
bound
volume
of
the
record
and
the
briefs
in
our
court
of
appeals,
if
this
will
serve
the
court's
purpose
better
than
professor
collins'
loose
volume,
i'll
be
happy
to
leave
it.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
now,
your
honors,
i
advert
to
--
to
the
two
points
raised
by
petitioner,
which
i
think
really
involved
one
question.
the
second
point
is
that
the
petitioner's
confession
was,
in
fact,
in
a
law
voluntary.
and
the
third
is
that
the
--
that's
my
answer.
he
says
it
was
involuntary,
and
he
says
in
his
third
point
that
in
any
rate,
the
district
court
shouldn't
have
decided
the
question
without
a
hearing.
and
i
answer
that
they
should.
now,
for
this
reason,
it's
necessary
to
refer
a
little
more
fully
to
the
facts
of
the
case
than
did
professor
collins.
this
defendant,
with
a
woman,
had
entered
a
brooklyn
hotel
and
perpetrated
a
robbery
on
a
number
of
people
there.
i
make
no
further
reference
to
the
woman
because
she
pleaded
guilty
to
manslaughter
in
the
first
degree
and
nothing
in
this
case
is,
in
anyway,
affected
by
her
participation
in
the
crime.
after
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
if
the
point
is
raised.
i
think
he
meant
that.
suppose,
your
honor,
that
we
offered
no
objection
whatever
is
made.
in
fact,
there's
a
concession
by
silence
that
it's
a
perfectly
voluntary
confession.
you
don't
have
to
have
a
voir
dire
on
that
point.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
you
may
suppose
it
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
then
the
preliminary
hearing
will
be
held
if
we
offer
it.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
oh,
yes.
yes.
the
admission
of
a
--
a
confession
to
which
an
objection
has
been
made
without
a
preliminary
voir
dire
would
be
clear
error
under
new
york
law
without
more.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes,
unless,
as
i
have
said
before,
counsel
has
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
it's
part
of
the
trial.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
it's
conducted
in
the
hearing
of
the
jury
unless
counsel
asks
that
the
jury
be
excluded
during
the
voir
dire.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
oh,
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that's
right.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
and
as
i
say
if
the
court
denied
the
voir
dire,
the
request
for
voir
dire,
this
would
be
grounds
for
reversal
without
more,
regardless
of
the
other
proof
of
guilt.
now,
as
i
say,
your
honors,
this
man
entered
a
brooklyn
hotel
with
the
woman.
he
perpetrated
a
robbery.
]he
herded
the
victims
to
an
upper
floor
room,
and
in
effect,
he
said,
"you
stay
here
and
don't
make
any
noise
or
else."
but
when
he
got
down
on
the
street,
they
broke
the
window
--
a
window
and
they
shouted
for
help.
there
was
a
policeman
named
ramos
in
the
vicinity,
and
ramos
ran
towards
the
defendant.
unfortunately,
he
didn't
have
his
service
revolver
out
when
he
met
up
with
the
defendant.
and
a
struggle
ensued
during
the
course
of
which
the
police
officer
was
knocked
to
the
ground.
and
this
defendant,
and
we
had
other
witnesses
aside
from
the
confession
that
i
think
four
taxi
cab
drivers
has
happened
to
be
at
a
stand
where
taxi
men
rested
from
their
labors.
he
stood
over
the
policeman,
who
was
continuing
to
try
to
get
his
revolver
out
of
his
holster,
and
in
substance,
he
said
to
him,
"don't
be
a
hero,
don't
be
a
hero."
while
the
policeman
persisted,
he
finally
got
his
revolver
out,
he
shot
the
defendant.
i
think
it's
fairly
clear,
although
it's
confused.
it's
fairly
clearly
that
the
policeman
shot
the
defendant
first,
which,
of
course,
raises
no
legal
question
in
this
case.
and
then
defendant
shot
the
policeman
a
number
of
times.
and
after
he
did,
he
come
and
get
a
taxi
cab
and
asked
for
--
forced
the
man,
because
in
the
record,
you
will
see
somewhere
that
the
taxi
driver
says,
"put
that
thing
away",
meaning
his
gun.
he
forced
him
to
take
him
to
the
cumberland
street
hospital,
which
is
a
city
hospital
in
downtown
brooklyn.
the
taxi
driver
had
presence
of
mind
enough
to
say
to
the
defendant,
"i
can't
take
you
in
all
by
myself.
i've
got
to
go
and
get
help."
and
the
defendant
permitted
him
to
leave
the
cab.
there
was
a
police
officer
in
the
vicinity,
came
up,
arrested
the
defendant,
he
was
taken
into
the
hospital.
the
detectives
of
the
precinct
were
notified
and
very
quickly,
thereafter,
one
of
the
detectives
came
and
he
got
a
statement
which
certainly
implicated
the
defendant
in
the
crime.
and
this
detective
testified
that
the
defendant
was
strong.
he
gave
no
evidence
of
weakness.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
his
confession
is
not
at
all
tact.
about
almost
two
hours
later,
well,
i
should
say
this,
the
police
then
notified
our
office.
we
have
a
system
whereby
whenever
a
felony
is
committed
in
the
county,
in
the
borough
of
brooklyn,
we
are
notified,
and
somebody
from
our
office
goes
with
a
stenographer
and
interviews
witnesses
and
interviews
the
defendant,
if
he's
been
apprehended
and
tries
to
get
a
statement
or
a
confession.
it
was
about
two
hours
later
that
our
man
came
with
a
stenographer.
and
it
is
one
of
the
coincidences
which
happened,
which
give
warrant
to
the
phrase
that
more
--
truth
is
sometimes
stranger
than
fiction,
but
just
as
this
defendant
was
about
to
be
taken
upstairs
to
the
operating
room
and
just
as
he
was
given
this
injection
of
combined
scopolamine
and
demerol,
our
man
came,
took
the
statement.
the
evidence
shows
that
the
statement
was
5
minutes
in
duration
and
then
our
man
left.
now,
the
testimony
as
to
his
physical
condition,
there
was
nothing
in
the
record,
nothing
whatsoever
to
show
that
he
was
unable
to
try
to
give
this
statement,
the
trial
of
some
statement
about
his
being
refused
water
unless
he
continued
to
give
the
statement.
we
showed
quite
satisfactorily
that
he
was
refused
water
at
the
instance
of
the
hospital
attendants
because
that's
proper
preoperative
treatment.
nobody
gets
water
when
he
is
about
to
go
up
to
the
operating
table.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
oh,
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
very
badly,
very
badly
wounded.
he
had
been
shot
in
the
lung,
and
i
think
in
the
abdomen.
i
think
the
operation
took
several
hours.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
he
had
lost
a
little
500
cc,
sounds
very
great.
actually,
i
think
it's
a
pint
of
blood,
which
is
something
which
is
fairly
easily
repaired
and
re-supplied.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
we
hadn't
at
this
time.
we
hadn't
been
required
under
the
decisions
of
our
court
to
do
so.
we
don't
believe
that
we
are
required
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
required
absolutely
to
do
so.
i
think
i
may
sum
up
the
law
of
this
court
by
saying
that
the
failure
to
do
so,
with
all
of
the
other
circumstances
in
the
case
goes
to
the
question
of
voluntariness
but
we
were
under
no
mcnabb-mallory
compulsions.
there
have
been
certain
developments
which
will
probably
change
the
practice
in
our
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
don't
understand
that,
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
don't
think
he
--
i
don't
think
he
went
that
far.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
your
honor
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
--
pointed
out
to
me,
i
tried
to
deal
with
it
but
i
don't
think
he
went
that
far.
i
don't
think
any
of
our
experienced
trial
judges
would
do
that.
now
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes
sir.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
as
i
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
as
i
understand
the
case,
your
honor,
that's
so.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
don't
think
my
learned
adversary
is
correct
in
that.
i
--
i
think
the
second
--
the
second
statement
is,
"i
shot
the
cop."
mr.
william
i.
siegel
one
--
one
of
them
said,
"i
got
the
drop
on
him."
mr.
william
i.
siegel
and
i
as
remember
that's
the
first
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
got
the
drop
on
him.
now,
this
is
the
one
to
which
no
objection
is
made.
the
other
one
as
i
recall
it
is,
"i
shot
the
cop."
now,
in
the
whole
picture
and
framework
of
this
case,
i
doubt
that
the
jury
picked
out
an
adjective
or
a
word
and
in
order
to
attribute
more
importance
to
one
confession
than
to
another
confession.
they
considered
the
whole
panorama
of
proof.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes,
there's
no
question
that
the
defendant
knew
he
was
a
policeman,
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that's
right.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
at
that
time,
it
was.
in
state
law,
we've
since
had
a
decision
by
our
court
of
appeals
in
donovan
v.
menture
(ph)
in
which
by
a
very
sharply
divided
court,
four-to-three,
judge
fuller
wrote,
that
where
a
defendant
is
being
questioned,
this
case
happened
to
be
the
police
station,
could
be
by
us,
and
a
lawyer
retained
for
him
by
his
family
comes
and
asks
to
see
him
and
is
refused
admission.
the
confession
thereafter
gotten
is
inadmissible.
so
that
i
think
our
procedure
and
if
the
police
are
wise,
police
procedure,
hereafter
will
be,
if
somebody
comes
and
asks
to
see
the
defendant
and
he
is
going
to
see
him.
but
judge
fuller's
opinion
still
doesn't
go
to
the
length
of
saying
that
willy-nilly
and
without
a
request,
we
have
to
say
you
are
entitled
to
a
lawyer.
and
neither
a
prophet
nor
a
prophet's
son,
therefore,
i
won't
say
whether
in
new
york,
we
will
eventually
reach
that
point,
but
we
haven't
reached
it
yet.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no,
sir,
no,
sir.
judge
burke,
who
dissented,
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
requirement
under
constitutional
law,
federal
law
there
was
no
requirement
under
our
own
constitution
and
there
was
no
requirement
under
the
various
statutes
dealing
with
the
right
of
counsel.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
judge
fuller
disserted
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
judge
fuller
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
--
disserted
that
these
statutes
and
our
own
bill
of
rights
section
against
self-incrimination
require
this
holding.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
not
for
me
to
say
who
was
right,
but
i
do
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
--
have
an
opinion.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
not
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
he
says
quite
apart
from
the
federal
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes
sir.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
--
i
think
it's
in
precisely
the
same
words.
certainly,
the
same
intendment.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that's
right.
and
judge
fuller
recognizes
that
because
he
uses
a
phrase,
as
i
recall,
quite
apart
from
federal
requirements.
later
on
as
i
make
the
point
that
so
far
as
this
record
is
concerned,
there
is
nothing,
and
the
state
court
of
appeals,
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
all
agree,
that
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
any
disability,
mental
or
otherwise,
on
the
part
of
this
petitioner
when
he
gave
the
second
confession.
and
that
everything,
every
argument
made
in
his
behalf
in
this
court
is
based
upon
assumption.
it's
based
upon
the
fact
that
because
some
medical
authorities
wrote,
and
i
have
read
them
and
some
of
them
are
pretty
old,
that
scopolamine
and/or
demerol
generally
have
the
effect
of
dulling
the
mind.
this
happened
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no,
there
was
no
hearing.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes,
i
believe
so.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
alright,
your
honor
if
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
suppose
that's
so.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
you
pointed
out
in
townsend
against
sain
six
classes
of
cases
where
there
ought
to
be
a
hearing
on
a
petition
for
writ.
i
know
you
remember
them
but
just
for
my
own
benefit
i
want
to
read
this.
"we
hold
that
a
federal
court
was
granted
a
--
evidentiary
hearing
to
a
habeas
applicant
under
the
following
circumstances.
if
one,
the
merits
of
the
factual
dispute
were
not
resolved
in
the
state
hearing."
now,
they
were
resolved.
the
jury's
verdict
resolved
them
against
the
defendant.
they
found
that
the
con
--
that
the
confession
was
voluntary
and
having
found
that
they
necessarily
had
to
find
that
he
had
no
impediment
of
mind.
they
were
resolved.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
beg
your
pardon?
no,
sir,
this
is
a
general
verdict.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
they
--
they
found
him
guilty.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
and
they
found
him
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
because
they
were
charged
--
they
had
been
charged
by
the
trial
court
on
the
subject
of
the
fact
of
the
confession
and
what
they
had
to
find
in
order
to
accept
the
confession.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no,
because
i
think
the
charge,
the
instruction
pointed
out
that
once
the
confession
had
been
received,
if
they
found
it
in
--
has
been
involuntary,
they
had
to
acquit.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that's
somewhere
in
the
record,
your
honor.
i
got
at
the
moment
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
where
is
that,
right
in
the
little
one?
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
i
think
that
sustains
my
assertion.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
no,
they
couldn't
--
they
couldn't
consider
that.
they
couldn't
consider.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
on
--
on
all
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that's
stein.
that's
the
practice.
i
guess
practice
in
new
york
is
practice
in
the
federal
courts
so
far
as
i
know.
now,
the
second
class
of
cases,
the
state
factual
determination
is
not
fairly
supported
by
the
record
as
a
whole.
we
say
that
just
because
counsel
didn't
inquire
into
the
hypothetical
features
does
not
mean
that
the
evidence
which
actually
is
there
does
not
support
the
finding
that
the
defendant's
mind
was
not
affected.
the
third,
the
fact
finding
procedure
employed
by
a
state
court
was
not
adequate
to
afford
a
full
and
fair
hearing.
well,
i
think
the
answer
is
that
our
voir
dire
procedure
does
support
such
an
opportunity.
the
fourth,
there
is
a
substantial
allegation
of
newly
discovered
evidence.
now,
your
honors,
there's
no
new
evidence
offered
to
this
court
and
there
was
none
offered
to
the
district
court.
all
that
is
being
offered
now
is
the
fact
that
in
cases
quite
different
from
the
instant
case,
this
court
has
held
that
demerol
--
that
a
confession
induced
by
demerol
is
inadmissible.
and
all
--
in
addition
to
that
that's
offered,
is
that
there's
some
medical
--
there
are
some
medical
treatises,
some
medical
learning
on
the
subject
of
demerol.
but
evidence
as
such,
evidence
tending
to
show
even
in
the
most
minute
particular
that
this
defendant
was
thus
affected
has
not
been
offered
and
is
not
now
offered
in
this
case,
in
this
court.
it's
only
generalizations
based
on
medical
knowledge
but
the
material
facts
were
not
adequately
developed
at
the
state
court
hearing.
now,
i'll
skip
this
for
a
moment.
and
six,
for
any
reason,
it
appears
that
the
state
trier
of
fact
did
not
afford
the
habeas
applicant
a
full
and
fair
fact
hearing.
now,
i
--
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
question
that
--
that
the
hearing
was
fair
insofar
as
it
went.
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
whatever
limitations
on
the
hearing
that
were
in
the
state
court
was
--
were
limitations
self-imposed
by
counsel.
in
other
words,
counsel
didn't
ask
for
more
than
the
defendant
got.
i
--
i
think
this
requires
me
to
say
word
about
counsel.
defendant
was
represented
by
assigned
counsel,
chief
of
whom
and
the
gentleman
who
carried
the
fall
was
mr.
leo
healy.
i
think
in
my
brief,
i
speak
of
him
as
the
nestor
of
the
criminal
bar
in
brooklyn.
he
was
then
almost
70
years
of
age.
he
had
in
his
earlier
days
been
an
assistant
district
attorney.
he'd
been
a
magistrate
and
for
upwards
of
a
half
a
century
had
practiced
criminal
law
almost
exclusively.
he
was
assigned
to
this
man.
your
honors
will
read
the
record.
i
think
you
will
perceive
that
he
did
for
his
client
everything
that
anybody
could
do
for
a
client
in
the
situation
and
precarious
predicament
in
which
this
defendant
found
himself
on
the
trial.
so
far
as
i
pointed
out,
we
had
eyewitnesses
that
the
defendant
stood
over
the
policeman
and
said,
"don't
be
a
hero.
don't
be
a
hero."
and
finally
shot
him.
now,
what
was
judge
healy
to
do
in
a
case
like
this?
was
he
to
exercise
his
forensic
ability
and
he
had
it
in
great
degree,
he
had
a
voice
that
sounded
like
the
overtones
of
a
cathedral
organ.
and
try
to
get
this
man
acquitted
in
the
face
of
the
overwhelming
evidence,
one,
of
premeditated
murder
and
two,
that
it
--
it
was
a
homicide
committed
at
the
very
moment
of
the
completion
of
the
robbery?
well,
no
lawyer
worthy
of
resolved
would
do
that
anymore
than
a
general
would
send
a
platoon
against
a
division.
all
mr.
healy
had
opened
to
him,
and
all
he
tried
to
do
was
to
persuade
the
jury
not
to
convict
his
defendant,
his
client,
a
murder
in
the
first
degree.
and
the
summation
is
replete
with
that.
he
uses
the
word
i
don't
quite
understand
the
--
the
relevance
of
this.
he
says,
"it
would
be
--
it
would
be
affectatious
for
me
to
ask
you
to
acquit
the
defendant
completely."
and
his
whole
summation
was
devoted
to
an
attempt
to
show
that
there
was
no
premeditation
and
that
the
felony
had
long
been
completed
and
therefore,
this
was
not
a
true
felony
murder.
now,
to
say
to
my
friend,
it's
too
gentlemanly
to
say
it,
but
i
think
it's
implied
in
his
argument
even
though
he
rejects
the
suggestion
in
his
own
presentation
to
say
a
lot
to
imply
that
judge
healy's
choice
of
tactics,
and
i
use
the
word
"advisedly",
and
i
don't
there
is
anything
offensive
about
it.
that
to
say
or
to
imply
that
judge
healy's
choice
of
trial
tactics
rendered
the
representation
that
bad,
as
to
make
a
mockery
of
justice
in
this
case,
is
i
think
to
misconceive
the
nature
of
the
state
and
federal
cases
on
that
subject
and
to
misconceive
the
--
the
tenor
of
the
trial.
now,
let
me
concede
that
the
issue
was
not
fully
explored.
it
wasn't.
i
take
it
that
judge
healy
had
been
so
minded
he
could
have
asked
for
a
continuance.
and
he
could
have
brought
in
an
expert
witness
or
witnesses.
and
the
expert
could
have
testified
in
response
to
a
hypothetical
question
involving
all
the
evidence
in
the
case
and
maybe,
the
expert
would
have
said,
under
these
circumstances,
the
man
could
not
have
been
in
full
possession
of
his
mental
faculties.
i
think
judge
healy
had
the
right
to
say
whether
from
the
overall
point
of
view
of
the
ultimate
interest
of
his
client,
he
wanted
to
confuse
the
issue
in
that
fashion.
and
he
also
had
the
right
to
say
out
of
his
experience
and
out
of
his
ability
that
he
didn't
have
a
ghost
of
a
chance
to
win
this
case
on
that
kind
of
an
issue.
because
from
practical
experience
i
think
juries
demonstrably
always
pay
more
attention
to
a
witness
who
was
present
and
who
can
testify
and
who
did
testify,
the
man
was
alright
than
they
will
to
a
paid
expert
who
come
in
and
on
the
basis
of
a
hypothetical
question
pontificate
that
this
was
or
was
not
so
when
he
wasn't
there.
and
this
whole
issue
was
as
simple
as
all
that.
and
this,
by
the
way,
is
what's
going
to
happen
if
this
court
shouldn't
reverse
the
court
below
and
--
and
return
the
matter
to
the
district
court.
i
can't
conceive
that
this
court
will
reverse
the
judgment
because
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
warrant
anything
of
that
kind.
the
outside
limit
of
what
this
court
could
or
--
and
i
don't
say
should,
could
do,
it
seems
to
me,
is
to
return
it
to
the
district
court
for
a
hearing
on
the
issue
of
the
physic
--
not
the
properties
of
demerol
but
the
--
the
effect
of
the
demerol
administered
here
on
this
defendant
within
the
5
minutes
that
it
took
to
take
the
statement.
now,
what
would
the
district
court
have?
it
wouldn't
have
a
single
thing
beyond
--
before
it
that
it
didn't
already
know
because
everybody
knows
that
drugs
given
to
reduce
pain,
and
that's
what
demerol
is
for,
drugs
given
to
reduce
pain
have,
an
effect
on
the
nervous
system
and
on
the
mind
in
general
and
the
district
court
would
have
no
more
than
this.
we
get
hold
of
the
same
doctor.
we
get
hold
of
the
same
nurse.
we
can
get
a
hold
of
everybody
who
is
in
that
room
when
our
assistant
took
the
statement.
and
those
people
would
testify
and
testify
truthfully
to
the
same
effect
as
they
testified
to
on
the
trial.
and
then
they
would
be
paraded
before
the
district
court,
a
possession
of
one
or
more
experts,
who
would
testify
that
in
certain
cases,
demerol
causes
a
man
to
lose
control
of
his
mental
faculties.
they
couldn't
say.
they
couldn't
say
positively.
they
couldn't
even
approximate
the
certainty
which
our
eye
and
ear
witnesses
would
have
that
in
this
case,
it
has
that
effect.
now,
what
could
the
district
court
properly
do
except
to
find
after
a
hearing
exactly
what
it
found
before
a
review.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes
sir.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes,
sir,
that's
at
page
10.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
and
you
can
see
from
the
shortness
of
it,
your
honor,
that
when
--
when
the
testimony
shows,
it
took
only
5
minutes
but
that
testimony
was
adequate.
now,
your
honors,
this
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
there
was
some
testimony
i
think
at
page
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
makes
him
drowsy.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
think
that
was
the
word
that
was
used.
but
the
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i'm
going
to
read
--
on
cross-examination,
dr.
suarez,
who
had
been
present,
testified
that
demerol
is
a
pre-anesthetic
medicine.
its
main
action
is
to
relieve
pain,
to
deaden
pain
and
somewhere
in
here,
scopolamine,
apparently
isn't
in
question,
not
only
dries
up
secretions,
but
somewhere
in
here,
the
word
it
makes
them
drowsy
or
the
phrase
as
used.
and
then
on
redirect
examination
or
on
cross-examination,
judge
healy
asked,
"wouldn't
it
take
effect
in
a
shorter
time,
perhaps
on
one
person
than
it
might
on
another?"
the
doctor
said,
"in
children,
for
example,
the
same
dose
might
have
a
faster
effect."
then
the
court
said,
"judge
healy
asked
you,
doesn't
the
physical
condition
of
the
patient
to
whom
you
inject
have
an
effect
on
how
long
before
it
takes
effect?"
and
the
witness
said,
"oh,
no."
now,
this
is
undisputed,
nothing
in
the
record
to
the
contrary.
the
--
he
--
he
said
the
same
thing.
there
wouldn't
be
much
different
as
between
a
person
in
good
health
and
a
person
who
have
been
shot
through
the
liver,
is
not
much
different.
and
when
judge
healy
persistently
said
that
there
would
be
some
difference,
wouldn't
there?
he
said,
"i
couldn't
say.
i
don't
think
there
is
much
difference."
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
"well,
15
minutes
is
usually
the
time
of
action
after
you
inject
it."
he
says
it
operates
individually,
the
sum
and
substance
your
honor
is
that
our
witness,
it
was
not
contradicted
except
in
the
form
of
questions
which,
of
course,
wasn't
evidenced.
our
witness
in
substance
said
that
the
fact
that
this
man
had
lost
a
pint
of
blood
that
he
had
been
shot
through
the
liver,
i
thought
it
was
the
lung,
had
made
any
difference.
he
was
still
in
full
possession
of
his
faculties.
and
that's
exactly
what
this
witness
will
say,
i'm
sure,
if
there's
a
hearing
order.
and
so
will
everybody
else
who
was
there
speaking
as
layman
not
as
--
as
technicians
or
experts.
and
the
expert
alone
he
say,
"well,
there
are
cases",
i
sum
it
up,
he
say,
"well,
there
are
cases
where
demerol
and/or
scopolamine
will
have
this
effect."
but
i
can't
tell
you.
i'd
had
this
effect
in
this
case
of
course
i
wasn't
there.
and
i
can't
tell
you
that
it
had
this
effect
in
this
case
even
though
the
man
had
been
shot
and
even
though
he
lost
a
pint
of
blood
because
i
wasn't
there.
in
other
words,
it's
comparative
value
of
an
eye-ear
witnesses'
testimony
as
against
expert
testimony
in
response
to
a
hypothetical
question.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
your
honor,
i
have
to
guess
a
little
bit.
i
think
he
was
probably
thirsty,
didn't
have
any
water.
i
think
he
was
probably
tired.
i
think
he
was
very
uncomfortable.
but
this
is
far
from
a
concession
on
my
--
on
my
part.
i
certainly
don't
intend
to
make
one
and
it
is
far
from
a
showing
by
way
of
evidence
that
he
was
in
that
condition,
either
mental
or
physical
which
prohibits
the
taking
of
an
inculpatory
statement.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
his
testimony
on
the
trial?
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
would
hardly
have
expected
him
to
testify
to
anything
else.
but
the
law
is
well
settled
in
this
court
than
on
all
contested
questions
of
fact,
the
issue
comes
here
resolved
by
the
state
court.
and
in
this
case
resort
--
reinforced
by
the
action
of
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court.
the
only
thing
that
i
think
this
court
ever
concerns
itself
with
are
the
---
are
the
inescapable
conclusions
to
be
drawn
from
the
admitted
facts
and
this
has
been
said
in
thomas
against
arizona
and
a
whole
long
line
of
cases.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
from
the
book,
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
since
it's
a
death
case
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
since
it's
a
death
case,
our
court
of
appeals
searches
the
whole
record.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
of
course
i
can't
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes,
i
think
you
can
because
aside
from
the
reports
on
the
matter,
the
--
our
court
of
appeals,
after
affirming
the
judgment
on
july
7th,
1961,
on
october
5th,
1961,
denied
a
motion
for
re-argument
but
granted
a
motion
to
amend
the
remittitur
and
to
certify
a
constitutional
question
or
two.
these
constitutional
questions
were,
one,
whether
the
petitioner's
right
to
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
were
violated,
one,
by
the
use
of
a
coerced
and
involuntary
confession,
which
is
precisely
this
point.
and
the
other
had
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
the
confession?
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
have
no
way
of
telling
you
that,
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
since
we
have
a
general
verdict
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that's
right.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no,
because
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
--
there
was
a
question
of
fact.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
don't
believe
so.
from
the
pagination,
i
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
don't
think
there
was
an
opinion
in
our
court
of
appeal.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
they
considered
it.
no.
mr.
justice
black
asked
me
if
they
had
written
an
opinion.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
oh,
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
they
granted
a
motion
to
amend
the
remittitur
and
they
certified
that
upon
the
argument
of
the
appeal,
a
constitutional
question
was
necessarily
presented
and
decided
to
wit.
and
then
one
of
the
questions
was
whether
or
not
the
use
of
this
confession
violated
his
rights
to
due
process
and
the
other
related
to
the
charge
by
the
trial
jury.
but
this
is
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
--
exactly
the
question
that
was
raised
in
stein
your
honor
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
--
the
same
complaint.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
don't
know
of
any.
i
think
our
statute,
one
of
the
sections
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
permits
of
special
verdicts.
it
doesn't
say
specifically
with
respect
to
a
confession,
but
it
does
permit
of
special
verdict,
but
i
never
heard
of
one.
never
saw
one
considered
in
--
in
the
cases.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
first,
i
didn't
intend
to
say
memory,
i
--
his
mentality
in
general.
secondly,
i
don't
find
anything
in
the
petition
which
specifically
--
which
specifically
claims
that
demorol
and/or
scopolamine
lands
him
--
i've
used
--
they
put
susceptible
to
suggestion.
there's
no
such
claim
that
i
know
of.
i
--
as
i
understand,
it
is
claimed
that
when
he
talked,
he
didn't
know
what
he
was
saying.
put
it
in
layman's
language,
he
didn't
know
what
he
was
saying
and
therefore,
this
was
not
the
free
product
of
a
conscious
mind.
and
as
i
say,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
if
repetition
will
add
very
much.
this
is
based
on
nothing
more
than
few
articles
in
the
pharma
code
here
and
so
on.
there's
no
basis
whatever
into
it.
