nathan
jackson,
petitioner,
versus
wilfred
denno.
mr.
collins,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
do
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
did
--
mr.
collins,
did
the
doctors
state
for
what
reason
he
gave
both
these
two
drugs,
scopolamine
and
demerol?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
it
would
depend
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
the
amount
that
was
given
too,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
i
--
without
casting
any
aspersion
on
--
on
anyone
whether
it's
a
normal
--
normal
dose
or
--
or
not,
i
suppose
the
size
of
the
dose
would
--
would
make
some
difference,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
townsend
versus
sain
that
was
one
of
the
principle
contentions
of
the
--
of
the
state
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
counsel
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
propose
a
more
specific
instruction
on
--
on
the
administering
of
this
drug
and
the
one
given
by
the
court,
which
says
you
shall
take
into
the
consideration
all
the
surrounding
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
if
counsel
had
asked
for
a
more
specific
instruction
that
the
court
would
have
been
obliged
to
give
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
i
mean
is
--
what
i
mean
is
--
is
this.
the
general
instruction
you
take
into
consideration,
all
the
surrounding
circumstances
might
mean
one
thing,
but
if
they
were
--
were
asked
to
take
into
--
to
consider,
you're
entitled
to
consider
the
effect
of
this
drug
upon
--
on
his
--
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession,
it
might
--
it
might
mean
another
thing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
reserve
the
rest
of
your
time,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
collins.
mr.
siegel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
--
you
may
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
sure.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
he
does
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
he
does
object
to
the
confession
at
the
outset,
is
--
is
he
then
required
to
have
a
preliminary
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it's
a
part
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
--
the
voir
dire
is
a
part
of
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
siegel,
may
i
ask
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
where
that
confession
is,
that
second
confession
is
in
the
record
at,
do
you
recall?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
(inaudible)
