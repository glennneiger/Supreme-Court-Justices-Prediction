mr.
daniel
g.
collins
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
daniel
g.
collins,
counsel
for
petitioner.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
that
court
affirmed
the
order
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
denying
petitioner
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
petitioner
seeks
the
great
writ
on
the
ground
with
his
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution,
had
been
violated
by
his
conviction
for
first
degree
premeditated
murder
in
the
courts
in
the
state
of
new
york.
the
murder
of
which
petitioner
was
convicted
took
place
shortly
after
1
a.m.
on
june
14,
1960
in
brooklyn,
new
york.
not
long
thereafter,
petitioner
was
arrested
as
he
alighted
from
a
taxi
--
taxicab
in
the
vicinity
of
brooklyn's
cumberland
hospital.
he
was
then
suffering
from
gunshot
wounds.
at
about
2:00
a.m.,
petitioner
was
questioned
in
the
hospital's
x-ray
room
by
a
police
detective
and
there
made
a
confession.
the
police
notified
the
district
attorney's
office
and
an
assistant
district
attorney
came
to
the
hospital
and
beginning
at
3:55
a.m.,
took
a
second
transcribed
confession
from
petitioner.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
no,
it
was
taken
in
ward
46,
i
believe
justice
goldberg.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
it
was
approximately
throughout
an
hour
before
the
operation
begun.
both
confessions
were
introduced
into
evidence
at
the
state
trial.
however,
it
is
only
the
admission
of
the
second
confession
that
made
to
the
assistant
district
attorney
that
petitioner
contends
violated
his
constitutional
rights.
at
the
time
the
second
confession
was
taken,
petitioner
was
suffering
from
bullet
wounds
in
the
liver
and
lung.
he
was
about
to
undergo
a
lifesaving
operation.
he
had
lost
approximately
500
cc's
of
blood.
he
had
just
been
given
injections
of
two
drugs,
demerol
and
scopolamine.
he'd
been
asking
for
water
but
it
had
--
but
it
had
been
refused.
he
was
lying
on
a
hospital
bed
and
his
interrogators
stood
over.
at
one
point,
petitioner
tried
unsuccessfully
to
stop
the
interrogation
saying,
"look,
i
can't
go
on."
in
all,
the
confession
took
approximately
five
minutes
and
was
concluded
at
4
a.m.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
it
was
different
in
one
important
regard
sir.
the
--
in
the
earlier
confession,
petitioner
did
not
say
that
he
had
fired
the
first
shot
in
the
exchange
of
gunfire
which
resulted
in
the
murder.
in
his
second
confession
to
the
assistant
district
attorney,
he
said
that
he
had
fired
the
first
shot
and
i
might
say
at
this
point
that
that
was
the
only
evidence
in
the
entire
record
that
--
that
indicated
the
petitioner
had
in
fact
shot
first
or
the
other
evidence
indicated
that
he
had
not
fired
first.
since
the
confession
--
since
the
conviction
was
for
premeditated
murder,
of
course
that
was
an
important
factor
in
the
case.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
yes,
he
said,
“i
got
the
drop
on
him.”
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
i
think
in
view
of
all
the
evidence
in
the
case
sir,
that
term
meant
that
he
had
his
gun
out
first.
the
evidence
indicated
he
did
so
have
his
gun
out
first
but
then
he
fired
all
the
other
evidence
that
he
fired
after
his
--
the
policeman
whom
he
--
whom
he
killed
have
fired
several
shots.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
yes,
he
took
the
stand
sir.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
yes,
he
was
reputed
or
said,
“don't
be
a
hero.”
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
he
was
charged
with
felony
murder
and
premeditated
murder,
both
and
he
was
convicted
only
of
premeditated
murder
and
received
the
mandatory
sentence
of
death.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
verdict
on
--
on
felony
murder
sir.
petitioner's
trial
counsel
did
not
object
to
the
second
confession,
not
to
the
assistant
district
attorney
at
the
time
it
was
introduced
into
evidence.
however,
during
cross
examination
of
the
hospital
physician,
who
attended
the
petitioner,
counsel
elicited
the
fact
that
demerol,
one
of
the
drugs
that
had
been
administered
to
him,
while
its
normal
effect
was
to
relief
pain
also
and
i'm
quoting,
"made
one
dopey."
the
physician
then
testified
that
while
drug
reaction
is
an
individual
matter,
it
takes
about
15
minutes
for
demerol
to
be
effective.
“he
also
said
that
the
fact
that
a
patient
is
suffering
from
gunshot
wounds
and
loss
of
blood,”
i'm
quoting
again,
"would
not
make
much
difference
in
the
time
--
time
of
the
drug's
effectiveness.”
thereupon,
petitioner's
counsel
objected
to
the
use
of
the
confession
on
the
ground
that
it
was
obtained
involuntarily.
during
his
own
testimony,
petitioner
said
repeated
--
repeatedly
that
he
could
not
remember
having
been
interrogated
by
the
assistant
district
attorney.
the
trial
court
submitted
the
question
of
voluntariness
to
the
jury
with
the
instruction
that
if
they
found
the
confession
to
have
been
involuntary,
they
were
to
--
to
exclude
it
and
to
base
their
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence
only
on
the
other
evidence.
the
jury
returned
the
general
verdict
to
first
degree
premeditated
murder,
petitioner
was
sentence
to
death.
the
conviction
was
affirmed
without
an
opinion
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
however,
the
court
subsequently
amended
its
remittitur
to
indicate
that
in
passing
on
the
question
of
voluntariness
of
petitioner's
confession,
it
had
of
necessity
passed
on
questions
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
this
court
denied
certiorari.
this
habeas
corpus
proceeding
was,
thereafter,
instituted
in
the
southern
--
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
the
district
court,
after
examining
the
complete
state
record,
denied
petitioner
a
hearing
and
denied
and
refused
to
issue
the
writ.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court's
order.
both
courts
filed
opinions.
petitioner
makes
three
arguments
here.
first,
that
the
courts
below
erred
in
holding
that
the
procedure
employed
by
the
new
york
courts
to
determine
the
admissibility
of
petitioner's
confession
did
not
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
second,
the
court
--
that
the
courts
below
erred
in
determining
the
petitioner's
confession
was
not
involuntary
as
a
matter
of
law
and
therefore,
did
not
vitiate
his
conviction.
third,
that
the
courts
below
erred
in
denying
petitioner
a
hearing
in
the
district
court
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
effect
of
the
drugs
demerol
and
scopolamine
on
his
capacity
to
make
a
voluntary
confession.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
i
do
not
here
make
that
point
sir.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
no,
sir.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
i
do
not
make
that
point.
i'll
argue
these
points
in
the
order
that
i
have
stated
them
which
is
the
order
in
which
they
appear
in
petitioner's
brief.
this
court
first
said
in
brown
against
mississippi
that
the
use
of
an
involuntary
confession
in
the
state
trial
vitiates
a
conviction.
that
rule
has
been
reiterated
frequently
and
the
court
has
made
it
very
clear
and
as
early
as
well
as
its
latest
cases,
the
last
two
being
lynumn
against
illinois
and
haynes
against
washington
this
year.
that
in
the
face
of
an
involuntary
confession,
a
state
conviction
will
not
stand
regardless
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
other
evidence
to
sustain
the
conviction.
but
the
constitutional
rule
of
brown
against
mississippi
is
at
least
in
the
opinion
of
new
york
and
other
jurisdictions
that
employ
a
similar
admissibility
procedure
subject
to
one
crucial
qualification,
that
is
that
there
maybe
introduced
into
evidence
without
vitiate
a
--
vitiating
a
conviction.
any
confession
which
is
not
involuntary
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
is
any
question
whose
voluntariness
is
a
fair
question
of
fact,
provided
the
jury
is
instructed
to
disregard
the
confession
if
it
finds
it
to
have
been
involuntary.
the
authority
for
--
for
--
for
this
view
is
said
to
be
stein
against
new
york,
also
dictum
in
spano
against
new
york,
also
a
statement
by
this
court
and
its
opinion
in
rogers
against
richmond
to
the
effect
that
the
procedure
for
determining
admissibility
of
confessions
may
matter
for
state
procedure.
petitioner
contends
that
this
idea
and
the
admissibility
procedure
that
springs
from
it
is
fundamentally
and
demonstratively
in
conflict
with
the
general
rule
that
admission
of
an
involuntary
confession
must
vitiate
a
conviction.
under
the
new
york
procedure,
the
constitutional
protection
against
coerced
confession
is
largely
an
illusion.
constitutionality
of
the
new
york
--
the
deficiency,
constitutional
deficiency
of
the
new
york
procedure
can
best
be
illustrated
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
yes,
petitioner
submits
in
his
brief
that
the
only
adequate
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
no,
i
think
and
i
--
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
it's
stated
that
that
--
that
the
petitioner
feels
that
question
doesn't
arise
to
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
and
i
believe
that
while
the
procedure
in
the
federal
courts
is
not
entirely
clear,
some
federal
courts
follow
the
procedure
suggest
the
so-called
massachusetts
variant
as
some
courts
simply
require
the
judge
to
make
the
permanent
--
the
decision
of
fact.
the
constitutional
deficiency
of
the
new
york
procedure
can
best
be
illustrated
by
assuming
that
the
jury
did
in
facto
--
in
fact,
took
one
of
the
several
causes
of
action
that
was
open
to
it
under
the
trial
court's
instructions.
that
is
that
they
found
the
confession
to
have
been
involuntary
and
that
they
also
found
that
there
was
enough
--
there
was
sufficient
other
evidence
to
sustain
a
conviction.
of
course,
because
the
jury
rendered
the
general
verdict,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
that
was
in
fact
what
the
jury
did
but
because
we
do
not,
it
is
only
fair
and
testing
petitioner's
constitutional
rights
to
assume
that
the
jury
took
the
cause
of
action
that
petitioner
contends
it
was
most
disadvantageous
to
him.
on
the
assumptions
given,
we
thus
have
a
situation
in
which
the
brown
protection
would
have
had
meaning
for
petitioner,
only
if
he
had
been
able
to
establish
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
trial
judge
or
later
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
that
a
finding
of
voluntariness
would
have
been
unreasonable
finding
as
a
matter
of
law.
otherwise,
the
confession
would
go
to
the
jury
as
it
did
in
this
case
and
a
conviction
would
stand
despite
the
fact
that
on
our
assumptions,
the
jury
found
it
to
have
been
involuntary
and
perhaps
we
might
also
assume
that
the
judge
would
have
found
it
to
have
been
involuntary
as
well,
if
he
had
been
asked
that
question.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
in
effect,
all
it
takes
for
a
prosecutor
to
place
any
confession
before
a
new
york
jury
is
to
present
enough
proof
of
voluntariness
to
raise
a
fair
question
of
fact
on
this
issue.
i
suggest
that
as
a
practical
matter,
this
is
a
very
easy
burden
for
the
prosecution
and
one
that
is
completely
unfair
to
the
defendant.
it
is
also
necessary
to
recognize
of
course,
that
there
is
no
legitimate
relationship
between
constitutional
protection
and
the
degree
of
certainty
of
constitutional
violation.
that
this
is
so
and
that
the
new
york
procedure
flies
in
the
phase
of
this
conclusion,
is
apparent
from
the
rationale
of
the
rule
that
coerced
confession
vitiate
a
conviction.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
just
before
the
court
recessed
yesterday,
i
asserted
that
the
new
york
procedure
for
determining
voluntariness
of
a
confession,
which
lets
the
jury
have
this
question
unless
the
defendant
can
meet
the
very
heavy
burden
for
showing
that
anything
but
a
finding
of
involuntariness
would
be
unreasonable,
imposes
a
very,
very
heavy
burden
on
a
defendant
and
in
new
york,
makes
the
protection
against
coerced
confessions
largely
an
illusion.
i
do
not
assert
this
merely
as
a
theoretical
argument.
i
think
it
is
a
prevalent
notion
in
the
new
york
criminal
bar
that
all
confessions
will
go
to
the
jury.
moreover,
it
seems
to
be
no
accident
that
a
great
deal
of
this
court's
litigation
on
con
--
coerced
confessions
has
through
the
years
come
from
the
new
york
jurisdiction.
in
appraising
the
new
york
procedure,
it
is,
as
i
said
yesterday,
important
to
recognize
that
there
is
no
legitimate
relationship
between
constitutional
protection
and
degree
of
constitutional
violation
that
this
is
so.
and
that
the
new
york
procedure
applies
in
the
face
of
this
conclusion
is
apparent
from
the
rationale
of
the
rule
that
coerced
confessions,
once
admitted,
vitiate
a
state
conviction.
we
note
today,
after
this
court's
opinions
in
rogers
against
richmond,
spano
against
new
york
and
mapp
against
ohio,
that
the
basis
for
this
rule
is
the
fact
that
our
system
of
constitutional
justice
will
not
tolerate
the
impermissible
method
used
to
obtain
such
confessions,
in
essence
that
they
are
used
--
taints
the
entire
proceeding
and
requires
its
complete
nullification.
only
if
the
rationale
of
the
coerced
confession
rule
or
the
unreliability
of
such
confession
might
there
be
some
justification
for
finding
a
positive
relationship
between
constitutional
violation
and
the
degree
of
constitutional
protection.
on
this
point,
i
think
it
is
useful
to
recall
that
in
stein
against
new
york,
mr.
justice
jackson,
speaking
for
this
court,
indicated
that
he
believed,
erroneously
we
now
know,
the
unreliability
of
the
confession
was
the
basis
for
the
exclusionary
rule.
petitioner
also
asked
this
court
to
take
cognizance
of
the
fact
that
the
new
york
procedure
compels
a
defendant
on
penalty
of
losing
his
constitutional
protection
against
the
use
of
an
involuntary
confession
to
take
the
witne
--
the
witness
stand
in
a
state
criminal
trial.
as
a
practical
matter,
a
defendant
cannot
afford
to
let
a
confession
go
unanswered.
he
must
take
the
stand
to
refute
or
explain
it.
this
is
just
what
happened
in
the
present
case.
petitioner
took
the
stand
to
deny
any
memory
of
the
interrogation
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
to
claim
that
in
any
event,
there
was
duress
present
and
to
deny
among
other
allegations
in
the
confession
that
he
had
admitted
firing
the
first
shot.
the
question
of
state
compulsion,
testimony
of
--
the
state
--
the
question
of
--
of
incrimination
under
state
law
is
squarely
before
this
court
again
this
term
in
the
case
of
malloy
against
hogan,
which
has
already
been
briefed
and
is
awaiting
argument.
should
this
court
find
unconstitutionality
there,
that
would
indicate
that
there
is
another
fatal
deficiency
in
the
new
york
procedure.
respondent
repeatedly
asserts
in
his
brief
that
petitioner's
argument
here
against
the
new
york
procedure
is
essentially
an
anti-jury
argument.
this
is
most
certainly
not
so.
in
the
first
place,
this
court,
in
a
long
series
of
--
of
cases,
has
firmly
established
that
a
confession
that
is
involuntary
as
a
matter
of
law
cannot
go
to
the
jury
without
vitiating
a
conviction
regardless
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
other
evidence.
respondent
in
--
at
page
15
of
his
brief,
himself,
admits
this
rule.
petitioner
is
only
asking
that
this
well-established
rule
be
applied
consistently
and
rationally.
secondly,
the
procedure
in
which
judge
and
not
jury
makes
the
factual
determination
of
voluntariness
is
the
traditional
common-law
procedure,
the
so-called
"orthodox"
rule.
professor
wigmore,
no
great
friend
of
exclusionary
rules
generally,
nevertheless,
was
outraged
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
law
of
evidence
by
the
new
york
procedure.
he
simply
could
not
understand
how
a
jury
could
administer
exclusionary
rules.
petitioner
here
certainly
cannot
be
accused
of
making
--
of
advancing
a
position
that
tampers
with
the
traditional
rights
of
juries.
petitioner
hopes
that
it
is
abundantly
clear,
both
in
his
brief
and
in
this
oral
argument,
that
the
rule
--
that
involuntary
confession
vitiate
a
state
conviction
is
based
on
their
abhorrence
under
our
constitutional
system
of
justice.
unfortunately,
the
new
york
procedure
does
not
serve
the
ends
that
a
constitutional
procedure
must
serve.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
i
think
this
argument
has
been
rejected
before,
sir,
by
this
court.
i
asked
that
the
court
now
accept
it.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
yes,
stein
--
stein.
stein
i
think,
yes.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
i
think
that
if
--
if
the
--
that
the
--
the
fact
of
self-incrimination
in
this
case
is
an
important
additional
factor
that
should
be
--
should
be
taken
into
account
should
the
court
feel
that
the
stein
argument,
itself,
the
stein
position,
previously
adopted
by
the
court
is
persuasive.
i
don't
think
it
is,
but
i
do
think
that
the
question
of
self-incrimination
wasn't
raised
directly
in
the
stein
case
since
the
defendants
there
did
not
take
the
witness
stand.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
yes,
it
does,
sir.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
no,
this
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
this
is
the
complete
confession.
its
re
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
yes,
it's
a
complete
transcript
of
the
confession.
respondent
reproduced
the
confession
at
the
back
of
the
record
and
its
there
as
the
same
as
it
appears
in
the
--
in
front.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
there
is
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
there
is
not
such
indi
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
there
is
no
such
indication
at
any
point
in
the
record,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
yes,
it
followed
within
two
hours
of
that
statement
which
of
course,
didn't
contain
the
statement
though
that
he
shot
first.
but
the
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
--
the
police
thereupon
notified
the
assistant
district
--
the
district
attorney's
office
and
an
assistant
came
to
the
hospital
and
took
the
second
confession.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
he
--
when
he
had
alighted
from
the
taxicab
in
the
vicinity
of
the
cumberland
hospital
after
the
shooting
shortly
after
1
a.m.,
he
was
approached
by
a
policeman
with
a
drawn
gun
and
then
taken
into
custody
and
taken
to
the
hospital.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
petitioner's
second
argument
that
is
that
his
confession
to
the
assistant
district
attorney
was
involuntary
as
a
matter
of
law.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
courts
below
took
an
extremely
narrow
and
pseudo-technical
view
of
the
facts
of
coercion
in
this
case.
there
is
no
dispute
that
at
the
time
he
confessed,
petitioner
was
desperately
ill
nor
is
there
any
disputes
--
dispute
that
a
confession
would
be
involuntary
when
taken
while
a
defendant
were
under
the
influence
of
the
drugs
that
were
actually
administered
to
petitioner.
the
answer
of
--
of
the
court
below
to
all
of
this,
and
i
think
it
is
a
very,
very
inadequate
answer,
is
that
there
was
no
problem,
and
i
am
quoting
"because
the
undisputed
proof
was
that
any
effect
of
a
demerol
would
not
have
commenced
until
at
least
10
minutes
after
the
confession
had
been
concluded".
in
the
first
place,
petitioner
submits
that
this
is
not
what
the
proof
showed.
it
showed
in
the
only
medial
testimony
that
the
--
that
demerol
reaction
is
an
individual
matter
and
that
any
statements
about
its
time
effectiveness
can
speak
only
in
terms
of
averages.
averages
is
not
my
term,
although
i
am
very
glad
adopt
it
here.
speaking
in
a
memorandum
of
law
in
the
district
--
to
the
district
court,
respondent
said,
and
i
quote,
"the
medical
testimony
was
to
the
effect
that
in
the
average
case,
demerol
does
not
begin
to
operate
upon
the
patient
for
15
minutes."
moreover,
for
the
purpose
of
safeguarding
this
petitioner's
rights
and
the
rights
of
other
--
of
--
of
criminal
defendant
similarly
situated,
petitioner
asked
this
court
to
hold
that
whenever
a
confession
follows
close
upon
the
administration
of
drug
and
memory
--
the
administration
of
will
and
memory
depri
--
depriving
drugs,
the
confession
should
be
regarded
as
presumptively
involuntary.
and
that
presumption
should
not
be
subject
to
rebuttal
merely
by
showing
--
by
general
medical
testimony,
some
time
effectiveness
of
normal
drug
reaction.
any
other
rule
petitioner
submits
is
fraught
with
the
greatest
danger
and
imposes
an
unfair
burden
on
--
on
a
criminal
defendant.
how
i
think
is
it
fair
to
ask,
can
a
criminal
defendant
mount
the
necessary
technical
attack
on
a
drug
induced
confession
when
there
is
a
real
danger
that
he
cannot
even
remember
the
confession
because
one
of
the
properties
of
the
drug
that
was
administered
is
to
create
amnesia?
the
very
least
that
the
prosecution
should
be
required
to
do
in
such
cases,
and
it
certainly
did
not
do
it
in
this
case,
is
to
prove
that
a
criminal
defendant
under
such
circumstances
had
the
benefit
of
advice
of
counsel
when
he
confessed.
and
i
think
that
bringing
in
the
question
of
counsel
on
this
point
follows
naturally
from
this
court's
many
opinions
on
coerced
confessions
in
which
it
has
said
that
a
criminal
defendant
who,
under
the
circumstances,
did
not
have
the
necessary
--
ordinarily
would
not
have
had
the
necessary
capability
of
making
a
voluntary
confession
should
have
had
some
independent
advisor-counsel
at
the
time
he
confessed.
such
cases
as
gallegos
against
colorado,
haley
against
ohio,
fikes
against
alabama,
culombe
against
connecticut,
all
considered
the
point
of
the
necessity
for
independent
advice
when
a
defendant
makes
a
confession
under
circumstances
that
indicate
that
in
all
probability,
he
did
not
have
the
requisite
mental
capacity
alone
to
confess
at
that
stage.
petitioner's
third
argument
here
goes
to
the
question
of
the
necessity
for
a
hearing
in
the
district
court.
denying
petitioner
a
hearing,
the
courts
below,
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeal
--
court
of
appeals
relied
heavily
on
brown
against
allen.
this
court
has
since
rendered
its
opinion
in
townsend
v.
sain,
which
found
that
the
brown
--
brown
case
was
an
inadequate
guide
for
determining
when
a
district
court
hearing
must
be
held.
at
the
very
least,
townsend
requires
a
reappraisal
of
the
decisions
below.
more
importantly,
townsend
also
offers
specific
guidance
for
this
case,
since
the
actual
basis
for
the
decision
here,
that
material
facts
concerning
the
properties
of
the
drugs
scopolamine
and
demerol
were
not
developed
at
the
state
hearing
is
very
much
in
point.
in
fact,
this
case
presents
an
even
more
compelling
need
for
a
hearing
than
existed
in
the
townsend
case.
here,
the
jury
was
told
merely
that
scopolamine,
and
i'm
quoting,
"dried
up
secretions".
the
jury
was
not
giving
the
--
given
the
faintest
inkling
that
scopolamine
is
notorious
as
a
drug
capable
of
breaking
down
will
and
memory
or
that
it
intensifies
all
of
the
effects
of
demerol
including
the
amnesic
effect.
nor
were
there
are
any
--
any
facts
developed
in
the
state
hearing
at
all
concerning
the
time
which
it
takes
scopolamine
to
be
effective.
as
to
demerol,
as
i
have
said
previously,
a
reading
of
the
attending
physician's
testimony
in
the
state
court,
indicates
that
he
made
no
categorical
statements
about
time
effectiveness.
a
reading
of
the
standard
medical
authority
does
not
bear
out
the
normal
time
effectiveness
periods
that
he
referred
to.
moreover,
the
trial
record
is
devoid
of
any
reference
to
the
manner
in
which
demerol
was
administered.
if
it
were
administered
intravenously,
the
drug
would
have
been
effective
immediately.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
no,
your
honor,
that
--
that
is
not
a
correct
statement
in
terms
of
the
entire
state
record.
it
is
a
correct
statement
in
terms
of
the
record
presented
to
this
court.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
yes,
petitioner
--
petitioner
is
not
arguing
here,
as
i
indicated
to
mr.
justice
harlan
yesterday,
that
the
instructions
were
erroneous
and
consequentially,
did
not
reproduce
an
entirety
to
charge.
the
charge
is
reproduced
in
petitioner's
part
of
the
record
in
this
court
is
here
for
the
--
for
a
purpose
that
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment.
however,
in
the
full
court
record,
just
before
the
jury
retired,
the
following
instruction
was
given
by
the
court,
and
i
quote,
"when
the
felony
terminated,
i
leave
as
a
question
of
fact
for
you
to
decide
taking
all
the
facts
into
consideration".
and
now,
i
come
to
the
important
part,
"and
i
have
in
mind
as
i
told
you,
judge
healy,
i
would
charge
in
regard
to
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
that
they
are
to
take
into
consideration
all
the
elements
present,
his
physical
condition,
his
mental
condition
and
everything
that
occurred
at
the
time
he
made
the
statement.
you
may
retire,
gentlemen."
i
think
that
that
was
an
adequate
instruction,
sir.
and
we
certainly
do
not
assert
here
that
the
instructions
were
inadequate.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
it
a
--
i'm
sorry.
it
appears
in
the
original
state
record
at
page
807,
folio
2421.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
this
was
a
charge
to
the
jury,
i
believe,
just
before
the
jury
retired.
there
were
a
number
of
special
instructions
given
to
the
jury
just
before
it
retired.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
yes,
i
think
that
is
confusing.
this
charge
came
after
this
--
this
exchange
came
after
that
request,
and
it's
--
it's
preceded
by
a
statement
by
juror
number
6,
"thank
you,
judge."
and
then
the
court
goes
into
this
instruction.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
it
is
not,
sir,
but
we
certainly
can
make
a
copy
of
it
available
to
the
court.
only
excerpts
from
the
state
record
are
--
are
present
in
the
--
in
the
record
in
this
court.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
yes
sir.
i
--
i
will
leave
this
with
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
i
believe
he
stated
that
--
that
they
were
given
for
normal
preoperative
--
operative
purposes.
and
i
think
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
standard
practice,
sir.
we
--
the
petitioner
has
never
asserted
that
the
drugs
were
administered
as
part
of
any
conspiracy
between
doctor
and
--
and
police
to
obtain
this
confession,
only
the
taking
the
confession
under
the
circumstances
made
it
involuntary.
and
i
think
--
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
respondent
would
agree
that
if
in
fact
the
drugs
had
taken
the
effect
that
they
are
capable
of
having,
that
the
confession
under
those
circumstances
would
have
been
involuntary
--
involuntary.
it
seems
to
be
respondent's
position
throughout
this
case
has
been
that
the
time
effectiveness
period
was
controlling.
petitioner's
argument
is
that
--
that
a
rule
which
decides
these
questions
in
terms
of
a
minute
or
two
when
drug
reaction
as
an
individual
matter
is
fraught
with
the
greatest
danger.
in
that
respect,
i
think
the
case
of
griffith
against
ray,
which
was
decided
in
the
ninth
circuit,
is
of
some
interest.
there,
the
confession
was
taken
under
almost
identical
circumstances.
testimony
by
various
medical
testimony
resulted
in
a
characterization
by
the
court
of
the
time
effectiveness
period
is
from
5
to
15
minutes.
the
confession
was
over
as
here
at
--
in
5
minutes.
the
district
court
there
said
that
the
confession
was
not
involuntary
since
the
drug
reaction
began
the
moment
the
confession
ended.
i
think
that's
frankly
cutting
it
too
close,
much,
much
too
close
to
protect
the
defendant's
rights.
fortunately
in
that
case,
the
conviction
was
reversed
on
other
grounds
in
the
court
of
appeals.
in
denying
any
need
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
i'm
sorry.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
the
--
the
drug,
the
dosages
here
that
were
given
so
were
normal
dosages,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say.
the
dosage
of
scopolamine
was
at
greater.
it
was
a
larger
dosage
that
was
administered
in
the
townsend
case.
i
think
it
--
it's
fair
to
characterize
them
as
normal
preoperative
doses.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
oh,
yes,
there's
no
question
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
--
of
the
standard
medical
authority.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
yes,
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement
that
--
that
under
the
standard
medical
authority
that
i'm
familiar
with
the
--
the
size
of
the
dose
would
make
a
difference.
but
i
think
it's
also
a
fair
statement
to
say
that
the
standard
medical
authority
has
indicated
that
the
doses
administrated
in
this
case
would
have
the
effect
that
i've
described.
in
denying
any
need
for
a
hearing,
respondent
makes
what
--
what
seems
to
be
today
a
somewhat
startling
argument
at
pages
32
and
33
of
his
brief.
his
position
on
the
question
of
hearing
is
in
essence
that
petitioner's
trial
counsel
decided
as
a
matter
of
tactics,
not
to
attack
petitioner's
confession
and
that
petitioner
thus
is
barred
from
attacking
it
here.
to
attack
the
confession
says
respondent
is
to
attack
the
competence
of
petitioner's
trial
counsel,
and
petitioner
here
has
not
shown
such
incompetence.
in
the
first
place,
it
seems
to
me,
the
record
indicates
quite
clearly
that
there
was
no
such
tactic.
quite
to
the
contrary,
the
trial
counsel
attempted
to
show
in
cross-examining
the
attending
physician
that
a
drug
was
administered
and
that
it
hadn't
the
effect
on
petitioner
of
making
him
incapable
of
rendering
a
voluntary
confession.
he
took
an
objection
to
the
admission
of
the
confession
in
--
in
the
court.
he
asked
for
a
charge
to
the
jury
specifically
concerning
the
effect
of
the
so-called
"sedation".
that
charge,
as
i've
indicated
this
morning,
was
--
was
in
fact
given
to
the
jury.
in
the
face
of
--
in
the
face
of
those
facts,
it
seems
to
me,
not
fair
to
characterize
petitioner's
trial
counsel
--
counsel's
tactic
as
one
of
not
protesting
the
admission
of
this
particular
confession.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
on
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
he
--
he
did
not,
sir.
he
--
the
--
what
he
requested
appears
in
--
in
the
record
in
this
court,
and
there
was
nothing
more
asked
than
that
and
nothing
more
given
that
i've
indicted
this
morning
from
reading
--
reading
from
the
state
record.
the
problem
was
in
the
trial
court,
not
a
problem
of
tactics.
the
problem
was
that
the
material
facts
that
i've
indicated
are
present
were
not
brought
out
in
the
state
court
hearing.
moreover,
i
think
respondent
misconceives
the
significance
of
this
court's
decisions
in
townsend
v.
sain
and
fay
v.
noia.
those
cases
indicate
quite
clearly
that
a
criminal
defendant
does
not
forfeit
constitutional
protections
because,
as
a
tactical
matter,
his
counsel
decides
not
to
protest
depravation
of
constitutional
rights,
something
more
is
required.
the
court
has
indicated
to
raise
the
argument
on
waiver
that
respondent
raises
here.
there
must
be
a
showing
that
the
criminal
defendant
consciously
and
willingly
participated
in
the
tactical
decision,
which
resulted
in
the
purported
waiver.
but
respondent's
argument
will
be
tenable
only
if
he
could
show,
probably
at
a
district
court
hearing
that
there
was
such
a
conscious
and
willing
waiver
of
constitutional
rights.
it
seems
to
me
that
on
the
facts
in
this
case
such
a
contention
would
be
incredible
in
any
event,
respondent
has
consistently
opposed
any
hearing
in
this
case.
for
the
reasons
stated
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
the
properties
of
the
particular
--
particular
drugs
with
respect
to
this
particular
criminal
defendant.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
you
--
you
had
--
sir,
you
had
one
of
the
drugs.
you
had
scopolamine.
the
problem
there
was
it
had
been
called
"atropine"
in
the
state
--
state
proceedings.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
scopolamine
and
atropine
are
the
same.
here,
we,
in
addition,
have
the
drug
demerol.
i
think
there
were
some
other
narcotic
present
in
the
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
atropine
is
the
same
thing
as
scopolamine.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
i
mean,
the
--
the
terms
are
synonymous.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
if
there
were
--
if
there
was
a
conscious
and
willing
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
--
participation,
that
is
certain.
i
think,
under
your
decision
in
fay
against
noia,
there
could
be
a
waiver.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
if
that
could
be
shown,
but
i
think
your
decision
--
your
opinion
in
fay
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
--
against
noia
indicates
that
ordinarily
a
hearing
is
necessary
to
determine
that
fact.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
well,
from
petitioner's
viewpoint,
the
question
of
waiver
is
--
is
not
one
that
he
would
raise.
of
course,
that
will
be
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
--
a
question
respondent
might
--
might
appropriately
raise
at
such
a
hearing.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
under
--
under
new
york
state
law,
i
believe,
the
rule,
your
honor,
is
that
failure
to
take
an
exception
in
a
capital
case
does
not
necessarily
preclude
it's
assertion
on
appeal.
failure,
of
course
to
exhaust
that
--
to
raise
the
issue
at
all
in
the
state
courts
would
be
a
question
for
this
court.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
yes,
the
--
the
way
we
have
phrased
the
plea
for
relief
in
our
brief
is
as
follows
on
the
stein
point.
for
on
point
two,
which
goes
to
the
involuntariness
as
a
matter
of
law
of
the
confession,
for
the
reason
stated
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
reversed
and
the
case
remanded
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
issue
the
--
the
writ
and
to
order
petitioner's
conviction
to
be
set
aside
and
that
he
be
discharged
from
custody
unless
--
less
forth
--
forthwith
accorded
a
new
trial,
which
i
think
is
the
proper
plea
in
such
cases.
we
certainly
don't
ask
that
the
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
then
we
would
revise
our
plea
to
save
reasonable
time.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
petitioner's
argument
is
concluded
at
this
point
subject
to
re
--
rebuttal.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
i
think
i'm
precluded,
mr.
justice,
from
--
from
contending
that
because
we
didn't
raise
it
here.
we
didn't
raise
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
frankly
we
did
not
raise
that
--
that
question
in
our
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
frankly,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
i
think
the
--
i
think
the
instructions
liberally
interpreted,
which
it
--
which
certainly
has
been
the
position
this
court
has
taken
similar
on
--
on
this
problem
would
be
adequate.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
i
was
reading
from
page
807
of
the
state
court
record
in
folio
2421.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
yes,
in
volume
ii
of
the
paperback
record.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
yes,
sir.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
i
think
the
instructions
could've
been
better
phrased,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
don't
think
the
court
would've
found
this
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
i
think
if
he
had
asked
for
that
instruction,
specifically
that
the
drug
--
the
effect
of
drugs
be
considered
and
a
court
had
refused,
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
refusal
would
have
constituted
reversible
error.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
and
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
but
i
think
in
view
of
the
--
in
view
of
this
entire
record,
these
--
these
--
in
trial
counsel's
request,
i
think
the
instructions
are
probably
adequate.
as
i
say,
we
did
not
raise
this
--
this
question,
specifically
because
of
the
statement
that
appears
on
page
807
of
the
record.
in
--
it
--
if
the
only
statement
had
been
the
statement
that
appears
in
the
record
in
this
court,
we
might
very
well
have
raised
that
question
and
argued
it
here.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
mr.
chief
justice.
several
of
the
points
that
have
been
raised,
questions
by
the
court
to
mr.
siegel,
i
think,
are
answered
in
the
stein
case.
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
jackson,
on
page
172
of
346
u.s.,
speaks
of
the
--
discusses
the
question
of
whether
the
jury
should
be
present
--
must
be
present
when
the
judge
makes
a
determination
of
voluntariness
or
involuntariness
as
a
matter
of
law
under
the
new
york
procedure.
now,
i'm
quoting
from
the
bottom
of
that
page,
"the
judge
is
not
required
to
exclude
the
jury
while
he
hears
evidence
as
to
voluntariness,"
citing
people
against
brasch,
"and
perhaps
is
not
permitted
to
do
so",
not
permitted
to
exclude
the
jury.
now,
i've
read
the
randazzio
case
and
i
don't
think
that
that
case
would
be
a
bar
to
the
judge's
--
frankly
to
the
--
would
be
a
bar
to
the
judge's
decision
to
exclude
the
jury
as
a
matter
of
discretion.
yet,
i
do
think
it's
a
matter
of
discretion
very
clearly
under
new
york
law.
as
to
the
amendment
of
the
remittitur
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
to
which
mr.
siegel
has
referred,
all
that
says
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
there
was
no
violation
of
any
constitutional
right
of
said
defendant.
i
assumed
that
the
court
simply
means
that
it
was
applying
what
we
have
referred
to
here
as
the
stein
rule,
that
they
simply
had
found
that
there
was
no
involuntary
as
a
matter
of
law
confession
but
have
not
gone
into
the
facts
except
to
the
extent
of
seeing
whether
there's
sufficient
other
evidence
in
the
record
to
sustain
a
conviction.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
yes,
sir.
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
yes,
and
still
have
to
state
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
i
--
i
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
i
so
read
the
amendment
of
the
remittitur.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
they
were
not,
sir.
that
question
was
never
raised
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
to
my
knowledge.
i
don't
think
that's
a
bar
to
consideration
of
that
question
by
this
court.
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
below
both
decided
that
question
on
the
merits
and
reaffirmed
--
reaffirmed
stein.
and
moreover,
i
think
we
have
a
principal
in
law
--
in
our
law
very
deeply
ingrained
principal
in
all
areas
of
our
law
that
a
defendant
need
not
perform
a
futile
task
and
i
think
in
the
case
of
the
new
york
courts,
the
stein
rule
is
so
well
settled
with
approval
of
the
federal
courts
and
this
court
in
particular
that
there
will
no
point
in
raising
that
issue.
and
on
that
point,
i
would
cite
to
you
as
--
as
an
illustration
of
another
court
which
has
recently
so
considered
a
point
which
wasn't
raised
in
the
state
courts
because
it
would
have
been
futile
as
united
states
ex
rel.
duke
--
dukes
against
sain
a
seventh
circuit
opinion
at
297
f.
2d
799,
which
involved
the
question
of
whether
exclusion
from
a
jury
of
--
of
jurors,
prospective
jurors
of
professed
group
was
against
capital
punishment
was
constitutional.
the
court
reached
the
issue
on
the
merits.
the
courts
decided
against
the
defendant.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
yes,
i
haven't
told
you,
but
i
think
i
do
know.
about
a
dozen
follow
the
--
oh,
i'm
sorry
about
a
dozen
follow
the
orthodox
rule
and
somewhat
more
follow
the
new
york
procedure.
i
think
the
new
york
procedure
we
would
say
is
the
majority
viewed
today,
although
in
wigmore's
time,
wigmore
set
only
a
few
jurisdictions
of
the
new
york
procedure.
it
seems
to
have
become
popular,
but
frankly,
i
must
say
that
reading
the
cases,
it's
very
difficult
to
tell
what
--
what
procedure
a
jurisdiction
is
following
particularly
in
terms
of
what
the
trial
judge
is
doing.
very
often
doesn't
appear
in
--
in
the
cases
wigmore
cites
in
many
cases,
sometimes,
he
has
jurisdictions
on
both
sides,
new
york
and
non-new
york
procedures.
as
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
i'm
sorry.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
i
think
a
few
more
follow
the
new
york
procedure
than
don't.
and
there
are
a
number
of
jurisdictions
where
it's
impossible
to
say
what
procedure
they
follow.
i
do
think
the
federal
courts
follow
the
orthodox
rule
or
some
variant
of
it
that
is
required
the
federal
--
the
trial
judge
to
make
a
decision
as
to
the
question
of
voluntariness
as
a
matter
of
fact.
whether
or
not
they
leave
that
question
to
the
jury
should
there
be
--
the
same
question
to
the
jury,
should
there
be
a
finding
of
voluntariness
is,
i
think,
the
subject
of
some
split
in
the
circuits.
as
to
the
question
as
--
as
to
who
shot
first,
on
page
12
of
the
record,
in
the
confession
of
nathan
jackson
to
the
assistant
district
attorney,
the
question
was
asked,
"who
fired
first,
you
or
the
police
officer?"
i
beat
him
to
it
was
the
answer.
i
think
it
--
as
i
said
earlier
in
my
presentation,
it's
clear
that
the
confession
contains
a
statement
that
the
defendant
fired
the
first
shot.
later
on
in
his
testimony,
defendant
denied
that
he
had
made
--
that
he
could
have
made
such
a
statement.
he
said
he
did
not
fire
the
first
shot
in
his
trial
testimony.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
it's
relevant,
it
seems
to
me.
i
--
i
didn't
raise
that
point
in
my
presentation,
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
the
question
was
asked
yesterday
and
i
pursued
it.
it's
relevant
only
to
the
extent
that
the
fact
of
shooting
first
was
a
material
part
and
it
was
a
material
fact
under
the
question
of
premeditation,
this
was
a
premeditated
murder
conviction.
i
think
the
rule
of
this
court
is
that
the
sufficiency
of
other
evidence
to
sustain
the
conviction
is
immaterial.
and
so
--
so
i
did
not
--
did
not
raise
that
question
from
it.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
it
may
very
well
have
(inaudible).
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
it
certainly
had
an
effect
on
mr.
--
on
mr.
jackson's
--
the
decision,
i
believe,
to
testify
since
he
affirmatively
denied
that
statement.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
there
were
four
eyewitnesses.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
there
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
yes,
they
all
testified,
i
believe
sir.
i
raised
the
question
of
right
to
counsel
on
page
11
of
my
brief.
as
i
raised
it
here
this
morning
in
terms
of
the
needs
for
the
prosecution
in
meeting
its
burden
of
proving
voluntariness
to
show
under
circumstances
such
as
present
in
this
case,
that
counsel
or
some
independent
advisor
was
present.
i
noted
in
a
footnote
on
page
11
of
my
brief
that
in
the
record
of
this
case,
at
page
46,
the
court
indicated
that
because
it
believed
there
was
no
right
to
counsel
at
this
preliminary
stage
of
a
prisoner's
detention.
there
was
no
right
to
counsel
that
the
court
would
have
excluded
that
with
respect
to
jackson
or
at
least
by
indicating
that
the
question
--
that
the
fact
of
right
of
counsel
couldn't
be
raised
in
the
case
of
the
codefendant,
really
told
jackson's
counsel
that
he
was
futile
form
to
raise
that
question
himself.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
yes,
i
believe
so.
i
believe
there
--
their
argument
is
essentially
an
argument
that
might
have
been
made
prior
to
your
decisions
in
fay
against
noia
and
townsend
against
sain.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
i
think
they
are
saying
that
is
a
tactical
matter,
the
defendant's
counsel
decided
not
to
pursue
the
question
of
voluntariness
of
the
confession.
and
as
a
result,
petitioner
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
yes.
i
--
i
said
in
my
--
my
presentation
before
that
i
think
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
no
such
tactic
and
i
think
that
can
be
shown
quite
adequately.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
well,
i
don't
think
so
because
this
--
the
question
of
scopolamine
simply
was
not
gone
into
under
state
court
at
all.
and
it
seems
to
me
from
the
reading
of
the
medical
authority,
scopolamine
is
--
is
more
of
the
culprit
in
--
than
is
demerol
in
the
ordinary
case.
scopolamine
is
--
what
produces
the
amnesic
effect.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
i
don't
know
why
counsel
didn't
go
into
scopolamine.
i
--
i
can
only
speculate
that
he
simply
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
he
went
into
one
drug
but
not
the
other
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
--
and
he
didn't
pursue
it,
he
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
i
think
they
are
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
--
making
that
argument.
and
my
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
well,
i
believe
that's
only
argument
they're
making
as
--
as
far
as
waiver
is
concerned.
and
i
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
no,
i
believe
their
argument
goes
to
both
drugs
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
--
because
i
read
in
their
brief
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
i
--
i
confessed
to
being
--
to
being
as
perplexed
by
that
as
you
are,
sir
that
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
no,
i
think
i
--
i
disagree
respectfully.
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
their
argument
in
their
brief
is
--
is
as
broad
as
i've
stated
it.
they're
saying
that
there
was
a
general
waiver
of
this
issue
that
the
trial
counsel
did
not
want
to
pursue
the
question
of
the
confession
for
fear
of
(voice
overlap)
the
jury.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
he
did
object
to
the
confession,
i
think.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
yes.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
there
was
no
voir
dire
request
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
--
to
the
jury.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
he
--
he
raised
the
objection
when
he
--
after
--
after
cross-examining
the
attending
physician
and
learning
that
demerol
"made
one
dopy".
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
at
that
point,
he
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
no,
he
didn't
--
he
didn't
exercise
his
right.
he
certainly
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
he
didn't
exercise
his
right
to
a
voir
dire
but
he
did
exercise
his
right
to
contest
the
question
of
voluntariness
in
front
of
the
jury
by
requesting
a
charge
and
having
it
made
as
to
the
general
physical
condition
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
and
by
putting
his
client
on
the
stand
and
testifying.
and
this
client
on
--
in
his
direct
testimony,
in
response
to
questions
by
mr.
healy,
denied
--
not
only
said
that
it
--
that
the
--
there
was
duress
employed
in
the
sense
of
being
deprived
of
water,
also
said
he
couldn't
remember
the
confession
at
all
and
denied
a
number
of
statements
that
were
made
in
it
in
his
direct
testimony.
i
don't
find
--
i
--
i
don't
believe
the
fact
show
it
such
a
tactic.
as
far
as
the
--
mr.
--
mr.
siegel
said
that
a
number
of
new
york
cases
didn't
bear
out
my
broad
statement
that
a
--
that
a
great
part
of
this
court's
litigation
dealing
with
coerced
confessions
came
from
that
state.
he
cited
four
cases,
i
had
add
fay
against
noia
which
had
coerced
confession
as
the
basis
for
the
problem
in
this
case.
and
in
addition,
with
now
three
cases
that
--
that
arose
in
jurisdictions
which
have
the
same
rule
as
the
new
york
rule
that
i
know.
payne
against
(inaudible)
or
the
courts
--
of
this
court's
opinion
in
that
case
indicates
it
has
the
same
rule
as
new
york.
haynes
against
washington,
this
court's
opinion
indicates
that
the
rule
at
least
in
washington
at
the
time
the
case
arose
was
the
same
as
new
york
and
haley
against
ohio
which
affirmed
as
to
new
york
rule
as
well.
so
i
do
think
that
the
statement
that
the
--
this
procedure
is
the
root
of
a
great
many
of
our
constitutional
promises,
an
accurate
one.
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
i
--
i
think
he
wasn't
aware
of
them
and
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
g.
collins
he
was
not
aware
of
them.
and
i
think
that
that,
perhaps,
is
born
out
by
his
own
reference
in
--
in
speaking
to
the
jury,
he
described
the
--
the
drug
is
atropine,
as
we
--
you
--
the
court
will
recall
was
the
problem
in
the
townsend
case.
if
he
thought
the
drug
was
atropine
and
he
might
have
thought
so
because
the
attending
physician,
in
his
testimony,
first
referred
to
it
as
atropine
and
then
changed
his
characterization
as
scopolamine.
i
said
they
are
the
same.
judge
healy
may
simply
have
not
related
the
scopolamine,
the
properties
of
scopolamine
to
the
drug
that
he
thought
have
been
used.
i
only
suggest
that
because
we
--
we
don't
have
a
definite
statement
in
the
record
of
course.
i
do
think
that
mr.
siegel
is
on
the
basic
question
here
of
a
general
finding
of
involuntariness
of
these
confessions
as
a
matter
of
law.
i
do
think
mr.
siegel's
argument
presents
the
question
in
its
most
dramatic
terms
and
that
is
the
problem
when
drugs
are
administered,
approving
their
effect
on
a
particular
petitioner.
when
we
are
talking
in
terms
of
minutes,
5
minutes
or
10
minutes
or
2
minutes
and
we
are
talking
about
drugs
that
deprive
--
deprive
dependence
of
their
--
not
only
ability
to
resist
interrogation
but
ability
even
more
importantly
i
think
to
remember
interrogation.
i
think
we
have
such
a
dangerous
situation
that
we'd
be
--
that
certainly
petitioner
feels
this
court
should
adopt
the
rule
which
would
strike
at
that
practice
as
a
general
matter.
thank
you.
