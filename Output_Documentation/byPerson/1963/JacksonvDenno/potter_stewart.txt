justice
potter
stewart
in
the
first
confession,
he
did
say
at
least
that,
“i
shot
the
colored
cop,
i
got
the
drop
on
him.”
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what's
that
mean
as
a
term
of
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
want
to
make
one
thing
clear
to
myself.
you
say
that
you
are
not
now
claiming
any
error
at
all
in
the
court's
instructions
to
the
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
do
you
think
there's
a
--
apart
from
whether
not
sure,
you're
precluded
from
making
it,
do
you
think
the
instructions
were
erroneous?
justice
potter
stewart
you
read
to
us
a
little
earlier
today
from
the
--
the
state
court
record,
enforcing
the
instructions,
what
page
were
you
reading?
justice
potter
stewart
807?
justice
potter
stewart
2421?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
happen
to
know,
mr.
siegel,
how
many
states
follow
the
new
york
rule
that
you've
told
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
new
york's
not
unique.
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
--
just
to
com
--
just
to
complete
your
new
york
procedure,
i
am
quite
sure
i'm
correct
about
this,
but
you
tell
me
if
i'm
not,
that
after
the
judge
has
determined
that
reasonable
minds
could
differ
as
to
the
voluntariness
of
a
--
of
this
confession,
he
then
--
if
the
confession
is
then
introduced
and
--
and
subsequently
or
at
that
time,
in
his
instructions
to
the
jury,
the
judge
tells
them
that
it's
up
to
them
to
decide
whether
or
not
it's
voluntary.
and
that
if
that
--
and
if
they
find
that
it
is
not
voluntary,
they
are
to
completely
disregard
it.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what's
he
telling
about
the
credibility
of
the
confession
if
anything?
justice
potter
stewart
just
a
general
instruction
on
credibility.
justice
potter
stewart
he
had
been
shot
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
through
the
liver?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
siegel
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
told
us
correctly
as
i
understand
it
that
no
objection
has
been
made
or
is
made
now
to
the
introduction
of
the
first
incriminating
statement
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
this
man
say
--
made
to
the
policeman
when
he
was
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
my
understanding
from
mr.
collins.
and
in
objecting
to
the
--
to
the
second
incriminating
statement
to
the
so-called
confession,
to
the
confession,
mr.
collins
made
a
great
point
to
the
fact
that
it
was
more
damning
--
more
damaging
than
the
first
one
insofar
as
it
made
explicit
the
fact
that
--
that
the
defendant
fired
the
first
shot
and
yet,
in
argument,
you've
said
that
has
nothing
with
to
do
with
the
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
which
one
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
first
statement.
justice
potter
stewart
"i
shot
--
i
killed
a
cop,
i
got
the
drop
on
him."
that
was
the
first
statement.
justice
potter
stewart
the
policeman
in
uniform
when
he
was
shot?
was
he
obviously
a
policeman
in
other
words?
justice
potter
stewart
but
isn't
it
quite
possible
that
they
found
the
confession
involuntary
but
found
that
there
was
sufficient
other
evidence
to
make
them
--
make
them
find
him
guilty
of
the
murder.
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
that
here?
justice
potter
stewart
be
--
because
there
was
that
other
confession
and
there
was
the
--
all
the
other
evidence
against
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
could
find
the
confession
completely
involuntary
and
if
they
followed
the
court's
instructions
completely
disregard
the
second
confession
and
nonetheless
find
him
guilty
of
first
degree
murder,
could
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
were
so
instructed?
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
court
of
appeals
--
excuse
me
--
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
court
of
appeals
have
to
hold
the
existing
new
york
procedure
that
is
the
stein
rule
of
--
violative
of
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
you
know
and
if
so
have
you
told
us,
if
you
have,
i've
missed
it.
how
many
states
follow
this
new
york
procedure?
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
far
as
you
can
gather
more
--
more
follow
new
york's
procedure
than
don't.
justice
potter
stewart
what
relevance
is
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
were
--
were
there
what?
four
eyewitnesses?
justice
potter
stewart
did
they
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
testify
as
witnesses,
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
--
there
--
was
there
a
voir
dire
here?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
he
didn't
make
that
kind
of
an
objection,
did
he?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
did
not
exercise
--
his
counsel
did
not
exercise
his
right
into
that
extent.
i
don't
want
to
argue
(voice

justice
potter

he
couldn't
