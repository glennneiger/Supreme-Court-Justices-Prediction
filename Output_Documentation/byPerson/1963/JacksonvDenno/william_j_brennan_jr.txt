justice

j.

illustrated
mr.
collins,
what
you're
saying
is
that
constitution
should
be
a
determination
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
on
contested
facts
should
be
plea
by
the
judge
of
voluntariness
or
involuntariness,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
which
goes
beyond
that
if
the
judge
decided
what
was
voluntary
then
absolute
a
requirement
that
the
judge
also
submit
for
the
jury
decision
whether
indeed
it
was
voluntary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
properties
of
the
particular
drugs
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
these
the
same
drugs
we
had
in
townsend
and
sain?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
same
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
atropine
here
as
well
as
scopolamine?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
scopolamine.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
suppose
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
we
should
agree
with
you
on
your
stein
point.
(inaudible)
require
a
reversal
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
preliminary
voir
dire
excluding
the
jury.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
recall?
very
few.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
what
you
said.
the
judge,
doubtless,
would
grant
a
request.
i
think
is
the
way
you
put
it,
but
i
gather
the
judge
is
not
obliged
to
even
a
grant
a
voir
dire
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
discretionary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
of
course,
all
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
gathered
what
you
said
though
that
if
the
jury
were
excluded
and
the
judge
were
to
conclude
after
the
hearing
of
testimony
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
this
was
an
involuntary
confession.
the
jury
had
never
hear
a
thing
about
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
don't
recall
any
instance
where
that
happened?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
--
i
think
i've
suggested
(inaudible)
that
that's
the
most
important
point
in
the
case.
where
does
that
appear?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
does
that
mean,
in
other
words,
he
--
they
might
have
assumed
that
it
was
involuntary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
have
read
the
record
as
justifying
a
conclusion
that
it
was
involuntary,
that
nevertheless,
there
was
sufficient
other
evidence
to
sustain
the
conviction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
therefore,
under
stein,
no
violation
of
any
constitutional
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
is
limited
to
scopolamine,
the
properties.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
(inaudible)
on
the
properties
of
scopolamine.
it
may
be
that
judge
healy,
defense
counsel,
was
just
not
aware
of
the
significance
of
those
properties
to
the
issue
of
voluntariness.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
was
not?
