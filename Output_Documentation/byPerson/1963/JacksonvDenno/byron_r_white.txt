before
the
--
the
evidence
should
address
itself
to?
the
respondent
--
respondent
in
his
petition
for
certiorari
and
his
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
his
brief
and
this
court
has
asked
for
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
the
effect
the
drugs
had
on
his
capacity
to
make
a
voluntary
confession.
that
question
and
that
question
only.
justice
byron

white
if
the
waiver
--
if
there
was
a
waiver
here,
i
suppose
this
--
here
in
point
would
wash
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
would
be
no
necessity
for
a
hearing
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
know,
but
i
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
hearing
should
also
address
itself
to
--
to
waiver?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
assumes
who's
the
--
that
assumes
something
about
the
burden
i
suppose.
i
mean
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
--
according
to
state
law,
i
suppose
he
is
concluded
--
i
mean
he
had
a
chance
to
object
to
the
confession
and
he
didn't.
justice

(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
indicated
that
this
certificate
that
they
gave
showed
that
they
did
consider
that
they
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
--
but
their
certificates
--
do
you
think
shows
that
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
did
consider
whether
it
was
or
was
not
voluntary?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
i
understand
that
we
are
asked
to
reconsider
stein
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
that
respect.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
do
you
--
do
you
think
the
state's
assertion
is
as
regards
waiver?
are
they
relying
on
some
sort
of
a
waiver?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
they
are
saying?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
can
they
--
how
can
it
be
their
position
--
apparent,
there
was
an
issue
raised
about
voluntariness?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
there
was
any
tactic,
i
suppose,
insofar
as
choosing
not
to
put
on
certain
kind
of
medical
testimony,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
you
can't
say
that
there
is
some
ex
--
that
the
state
was
the
exclusive
reason
for
not
going
into
scopolamine.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
trial
counsel
for
the
petitioner
did
not
go
into
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
on
his
mind,
and
i
thought
all
the
state
was
asserting
was
that
--
was
that
he
deliberately
and
--
and
knowingly
has
stopped
the
chance
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
--
yes,
but
that
is
--
that
isn't
waived,
that
isn't
in
a
waiver
argument
going
to
the
whole
issue
of
voluntariness.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
could
it
since
--
since
the
defendant
himself
testifies
--
i
mean
certainly,
when
he
--
he
was
put
on
the
stand
to
make
the
confession,
wasn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
am
not
--
i'm
just
suggesting
that
the
state's
argument
isn't
that
broad,
it's
just
as
to
--
it's
just
as
to
the
scopolamine.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
true
that
he
didn't
object
to
the
confession,
that
much
is
true.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
did.
