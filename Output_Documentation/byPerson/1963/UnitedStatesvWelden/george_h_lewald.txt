mr.
george
h.
lewald
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
--
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
the
question
here
decided
by
the
district
court,
ruling
of
the
district
court,
was
not
that
anybody,
who
testified
before
a
congressional
committee
pursuant
to
subpoena
and
under
oath,
acquired
immunity
but
before
a
congressional
committee
investigating
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws,
of
course
with
an
ultimate
and
a
primary
purpose,
for
legislation.
the
government
contends
and
seeking
to
overturn
the
decision
below
that
the
witness
did
not
obtain
immunity
from
prosecution
as
to
matters
about
which
he
testified
before
a
congressional
committee,
specifically
investigating
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
argument
can
be
grouped
into
three
headings,
one,
a
plain
reading
of
the
statute
involved,
two,
that
the
statute
applies
only
to
judicial
proceedings
brought
under
the
direction
of
the
attorney
general
and
three,
reasons
of
history
and
policy.
we
submit
that
the
government
has
to
--
the
first
section
of
their
argument
has
proved
too
much.
in
attaching
the
immunity
provision
to
the
appropriations
section
of
the
statute
and
to
read
the
immunity
proviso,
as
if
it
said
such
proceedings,
would
mean
that
the
immunity
proviso
would
run
out
when
the
$500,000
appropriation
ran
out
and
certainly
that
--
the
government
doesn't
contend
with
that
at
all.
now,
the
government's
contention
that
this
immunity
statute
applies
only
to
judicial
proceedings
brought
under
the
direction
of
the
attorney
general,
was
disposed
of
with
the
passage
of
the
act
of
june
30,
1906,
wherein
the
congress
saw
it
in
the
light
of
the
armour
decision,
so
the
decision
by
district
court
in
northern
district
of
illinois
to
declare
its
intent
and
define
the
right
to
immunity
of
witnesses
under
this
immunity
act,
the
act
of
february
25,
1903.
now,
the
armour
case
result
--
arose
as
a
result
of
a
resolution
of
the
house
of
representatives
requesting
that
the
secretary
of
commerce
and
labor
investigate
the
low
prices
of
beef
cattle
and
to
report
his
findings
as
to
whether
or
not
these
prices
resulted
or
had
resulted
from
any
combination
in
restraint
of
trade.
now,
in
obedience
to
this
resolution,
the
secretary
directed
the
commissioner
of
corporations
to
conduct
the
inquiry
and
thereafter
the
commissioner
traveled
to
chicago
and
he
met
with
the
officers
of
the
leading
meatpacking
companies.
and
he
explained
his
mission
as
it
had
been
set
out
in
a
congressional
resolution.
he
informed
the
meatpackers
that
he
was
acting
independently
and
that
he
was
not
acting
in
cooperation
with
the
attorney
general.
and
he
proceeded
with
the
investigation.
a
few
months
after
his
report
reached
the
congress,
an
indictment
was
returned
under
the
sherman
act.
the
defendant
meatpackers
claimed
immunity
on
the
basis
of
the
informal
discussions
that
they
have
had
with
the
commissioner
of
corporations
during
his
investigation
of
the
low
prices
of
beef
cattle.
they
asserted
immunity
under
two
statutes,
one,
the
act
here
in
question,
the
act
of
february
25,
1903
and
also
under
the
act
setting
up
the
department
of
commerce
and
labor
which
had
incorporated
in
that
act
the
immunity
provisions
of
the
compulsory
testimony
of
statute
of
1893.
the
government
urged
that
this
latter
act
was
not
applicable
when
no
defendant
in
the
investigation
conducted
by
the
commission
of
corporations
had
been
subpoenaed
or
had
testified
under
oath
as
required
by
that
act.
the
district
court
sustained
the
defendant's
pleas
immunity
on
both
--
under
both
statutes.
and
while
finding
that
the
necessary
degree
of
compulsion
was,
nevertheless,
present,
despite
the
absence
of
a
subpoena
and
despite
the
absence
of
an
oath,
the
court
further
noted
that
under
the
act
here
in
question,
no
such
prerequisites
were
required.
the
act
of
february
25,
1903
at
that
time
did
not
require
a
subpoena
or
an
oath
in
order
for
immunity
to
attach.
this
case
became
a
national
consulate.
the
president,
in
a
special
message,
called
upon
the
congress
to
pass
a
declaratory
act
to
set
aside
the
district
court's
misconception
of
the
congressional
purpose.
a
bill
to
declare
the
true
intent
and
meaning
of
the
immunity
act
was
drafted
by
the
attorney
general
and
introduced
in
the
congress.
now,
what
is
of
significance
here
is
that
with
the
attention
of
the
president,
the
attorney
general
and
the
congress
riveted
on
this
armour
decision,
the
district
court's
holding
in
that
decision
that
immunity
under
the
act
here
in
question,
was
available
to
a
witness
appearing
before
an
investigatory
body
in
proceedings
outside
of
the
courts
and
not
under
the
direction
of
the
attorney
general
but
conducted
for
primarily
a
congressional
purpose
that
is
with
an
aid
to
legislation.
all
of
these
things
were
taken
for
granted.
what
was
upsetting
however
was
that
immunity
had
been
extended
to
witnesses
who
were
in
effect
volunteers
and
as
stated
by
this
court
in
monia
--
united
states-monia,
317,
united
states
424.
the
decision
attracted
public
interest
since
if
it
stood,
one
could
immunize
himself
from
prosecution
by
simply
volunteering
information
to
investigatory
bodies.
the
result
of
all
this
was
the
act
of
june
30,
1906,
defining
the
right
to
immunity
of
witnesses.
and
where
the
armour
decision
directly
before
it,
the
only
change
in
the
immunity
statute
which
congress
saw
fit
to
make,
was
to
impose
a
requirement
that
henceforth,
testimony
be
given
pursuant
to
subpoena
and
taken
under
oath.
summing
up
the
congressional
policy
as
to
this
legislation,
this
court
stated
in
monia
at
page
429,
"it
is
evident
that
congress,
by
the
earlier
legislation,
opened
the
door
to
a
practice
whereby
the
government
might
be
trapped
into
conferring
unintended
immunity
by
witnesses
volunteering
to
testimo
--
to
testify.
the
amendment
was
thought,
as
a
congressional
record
demonstrates,
to
be
sufficient
to
protect
the
government's
interest
by
preventing
immunity,
unless
the
prosecuting
officer
or
other
government
official
concerned,
should
compel
the
witness
--
witnesses'
attendance
by
a
subpoena
and
have
them
sworn."
and
going
on
to
spell
out
the
meaning
of
this
statute
in
monia
at
page
430,
this
court
said,
â€œthe
legislation
involved
is
plain
in
its
terms
and
on
its
face
mean
to
the
layman
that
here,
if
he
is
subpoenaed
and
sworn,
he
is
to
have
immunity."
mr.
george
h.
lewald
no,
sir,
it
was
not.
that
was
the
investigation
that
was
conducted
pursuant
to
a
congressional
resolution
by
the
commissioner
of
corporations
whose
report
was
returned
--
was
sent
to
the
congress.
now,
the
--
but
the
parallel
of
the
foregoing
to
the
case
at
bar
is
precise,
except
that
here,
in
this
instance,
congress
elected
to
have
the
investigation,
conducted
by
one
of
its
own
committees.
the
only
difference,
we
submit,
in
the
armour
case
and
the
case
here
at
hand,
both
started
by
congressional
resolutions
from
the
house
of
representatives,
both
seeking
to
inquire
as
to
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and
the
only
difference
here
is
that
in
this
case,
congress
elected
to
have
the
investigation
conducted
by
one
of
its
own
committees.
now,
while
it
is
true
that
congressional
committees
no
longer
have
blanket
independent
immunity
power
of
their
own
with
respect
to
all
investigating
proceedings,
it
doesn't
follow
from
this,
that
a
committee
investigating
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws
somehow
changes
the
existing
legislation
in
this
field
as
been
interpreted
by
this
court.
and
that
this
legislation
is
somehow
to
receive
a
different
construction
simply
because
the
investigatory
body
also
happens
to
be
a
congressional
committee.
now,
here,
in
this
case,
the
appellee
was
subpoenaed.
and
he
gave
sworn
testimony
before
an
investigatory
body,
which
was
investigating
antitrust
violations
as
was
conceded
by
the
government.
concededly,
his
testimony
was
substantially
connected
with
the
indictment,
as
the
government
concedes
in
its
brief.
now,
under
these
facts
as
stated
in
monia,
applying
the
test
of
what
this
legislation
means
in
monia,
he
--
the
appellee
here
is
to
have
immunity.
if
the
government
asks
in
effect
and
seeks
to
have
this
court
read
into
this
immunity
legislation
under
the
antitrust
laws,
which
congress
itself
hasn't
seen
fit
to
change
for
over
50
years,
an
exception,
the
result
of
this
exception
would
not
only
deny
the
appellee
immunity
here
but
will
able
--
enable
the
government
to
treat
the
appellee's
testimony
as
if
he
were
a
volunteer
before
the
committee
in
the
first
instance,
as
if
he
sought
out
the
committee
and
wanted
to
testify
the
committee,
testify
before
the
committee,
as
obviously
the
record
shows
he
is
not.
mr.
george
h.
lewald
the
--
the
record
has
been
certified
to
this
court
but
doesn't
and
hasn't
been
printed.
there
is
no
mention
of
a
claim
of
fifth
amendment
of
self-in
--
claim
against
--
mr.
george
h.
lewald
--
giving
self-incriminatory.
mr.
george
h.
lewald
we
read
the
record
--
record
a
little
differently
from
--
from
the
government.
the
counsel
present
here
was
counsel
of
the
appellee's
employer,
not
counsel
for
--
for
mr.
welden,
the
appellee.
and
there
--
we
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
itself
as
to
what
mr.
welden's
state
of
mind
was
--
mr.
george
h.
lewald
--
at
the
time
he
appeared
before
this
committee.
but
it
was
conceded
by
the
government
that
there
were
no
factual
matters
in
issue.
this
concession
was
made
below.
the
only
thing
that
the
government
contested
was
the
legal
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
so,
i
think
we
can
assume
from
them
--
from
that,
that
we
must
or
if
this
court
is
to
infer
what
the
defendant
felt
or
the
appellee
felt
at
that
time
he
testified.
we
must
infer
from
the
state
of
the
record
that
he
thought
he
had
immunity
as
a
result
of
being
subpoenaed
and
testifying
under
oath
under
this
legislation,
before
an
investigatory
body,
investigating
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
george
h.
lewald
no,
sir.
no,
it
would
have
--
on
--
mr.
george
h.
lewald
be
sworn
and
testify
as
to
matters
substantially
connected
with
the
indictment
as
is
conceded
here
under
the
rule
on
the
hickey
case.
mr.
george
h.
lewald
this
is
reported

states.
