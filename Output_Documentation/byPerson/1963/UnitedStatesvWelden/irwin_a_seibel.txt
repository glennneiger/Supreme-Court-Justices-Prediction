mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts,
dismissing
an
indictment
on
the
ground
that
appellee
had
obtained
immunity
by
virtue
of
testimony
he
gave
before
a
congressional
subcommittee.
the
issue
on
this
appeal
is
whether
a
person
testifying
before
a
congressional
subcommittee
is
testifying
in
a
preceding
suit
or
prosecution
under
the
antitrust
laws
and
thereby
obtains
immunity
under
the
1903
act
applicable
here
with
respect
to
all
matters
covered
by
his
testimony.
appellee
is
a
member
of
the
senior
board
of
executives
of
h.p.
hood
&
sons,
a
processor
and
distributor
of
milk
and
dairy
products
from
the
new
england
area.
he's
also
in
charge
of
three
of
its
departments,
government
relations,
economic
research
and
purchasing.
in
february
1960,
he
was
subpoenaed
to
testify
before
a
special
subcommittee
of
the
house
select
committee
on
small
business.
the
house
select
committee
had
been
authorized
by
a
house
resolution
to
study
and
investigate
the
problems
of
small
business
and
its
chairman
had
appointed
a
special
subcommittee
to
look
into
the
problems
of
small
business
in
the
dairy
industry.
on
february
18,
1960,
appellee
appeared
with
his
counsel
in
boston
before
the
special
subcommittee
and
gave
testimony.
during
the
course
of
his
testimony
at
no
time
did
he
claim
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
although
we
recognize
that
such
a
claim
was
unnecessary
if
this
were
a
proceeding,
a
hearing
before
a
congressional
committee,
were
a
proceeding
to
which
the
statute
in
question
were
applicable.
appellee's
testimony
contained
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
precisely.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
that's
right,
sir.
right.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
no,
your
honor,
this
court
in
the
monia
case
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
so
held.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor.
appellee's
testimony
contained
no
admission
of
wrongdoing
but
it
bore
a
sufficient
relationship
to
the
matters
covered
by
the
indictment
so
that
if
this
were
a
proceeding
to
which
the
statute
is
applicable,
such
as
a
grand
jury
proceeding
for
example,
appellee
would
have
obtained
immunity.
so,
the
problem
on
this
appeal,
your
honors,
is
whether
a
hearing
before
a
congressional
committee
is
the
kind
of
proceeding
to
which
the
immunity
provision
here
in
question
is
applicable.
in
april
1962,
an
indictment
was
returned
against
appellee,
his
company
and
others,
charging
the
violation
of
the
sherman
act
and
of
the
conspiracy
statute.
the
indictment
charged
the
defendants
with,
among
other
things,
with
price
fixing
and
of
engaging
in
collusive
bidding
for
contract
awards
from
federal
state
and
municipal
institutions.
appellee
moved
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
the
ground
that
he
had
--
he
had
obtained
immunity
by
virtue
of
his
testimony
before
the
congressional
committee.
the
district
court
granted
his
motion
and
dismissed
the
indictment
as
to
appellee.
it
held
that
a
hearing
before
a
congressional
committee
is
a
proceeding
under
the
antitrust
laws
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
here
in
question
and
that
therefore
appellee
had
obtained
immunity.
the
district
court
felt
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
require
a
man
to
stand
trial
for
conduct
about
which
he
had
given
testimony
before
a
special
committee
of
--
before
a
committee
of
congress
pursuant
to
its
subpoena
power.
our
position
is
that
the
immunity
provision
here
in
question
was
never
meant
to
apply
to
a
congressional
hearing,
that
it
was
only
intended
to
apply
to
a
judicial
proceeding
in
which
the
claimant
of
immunity
was
called
to
testify
at
the
instance
of
the
attorney
general,
a
judicial
proceeding
as
distinguished
from
a
congressional
hearing.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
well,
we
think
so
but
that
question
needn't
be
to
--
need
to
be
resolved
on
--
on
this
appeal,
your
honor.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
he
would
have
to
--
yes,
your
honor.
if
he
were
given
immunity
under
the
district
court's
decision,
the
committee
could
require
--
could
compel
testimony,
self-incriminating
testimony.
this
court
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
oh,
yes.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
oh,
yes.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
it's
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
that
would
be
lost
to
him
by
--
by
giving
him
immunity,
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
this
court
has
so
held
in
hale
versus
henkel
which
--
to
which
i
will
refer,
although
some
three
years
after
this
statute
was
passed.
that
in
a
--
in
giving
testimony
before
a
grand
jury,
the
witness
was
required
to
give
self-incriminating
testimony
because
immunity
is
given
in
that
type
of
proceeding.
now,
in
support
of
our
position
that
immunity
is
given
only
in
a
judicial
proceeding,
we
rely
on
the
language
of
the
statute
which
we
think
is
compelling.
we
rely
on
the
legislative
history.
we
rely
also,
more
important,
on
the
history
of
what
congress
did
when
it
focused
specifically
on
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
to
grant
its
committees
the
power
to
give
immunity.
i
--
i
shall
draw
briefly
in
the
course
of
my
argument
with
the
language
and
the
legislative
history,
but
i
should
like
to
dwell
at
some
length
on
the
history
of
what
congress
did
when
it
focused
specifically
on
the
problem
whether
or
not
to
give
its
committees
the
power
to
confer
immunity.
if
your
honors
will
turn
with
me
to
page
9
of
the
government's
brief,
we
have
set
forth
the
pertinent
language
of
the
provision
your
honors
are
called
upon
to
construe.
this
paragraph,
which
we
have
set
--
which
is
set
forth
in
indented
fashion
on
page
9,
was
enacted
as
part
of
the
general
appropriations
act
of
1903
and
follow
immediately
after
the
general
appropriation
for
the
department
of
justice.
your
honor
will
note
that
the
first
clause
of
that
sentence,
which
is
quoted,
provides
that
for
the
enforcement
of
the
various
acts
there
specified,
the
sherman
act
etcetera,
a
special
additional
appropriation
is
made
for
the
attorney
general
to
conduct
proceedings,
suits
and
prosecutions
under
said
acts
namely,
the
sherman
act
etcetera,
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states.
and
then
in
the
immediately
next
clause,
the
immunity
provision
is
--
is
follows,
it
gives
immunity
for
a
testimony
in
any
proceeding
suit
or
prosecution
under
said
acts.
now,
if
we
were
to
confine
ourselves
alone
to
the
immunity
provision,
we
see
the
testimony
--
that
immunity
is
given
only
for
testimony
in
a
proceeding
suit
or
prosecution
under
said
acts,
under
the
sherman
act
etcetera.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
i
think
it
was
codified
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
no,
this
is
not
a
reenactment,
your
honor.
this
is
not
positive
law
in
15
u.s.c.
32.
this
is
just
codification
--
it
hasn't
been
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
it
hasn't
dropped
out,
your
honor.
it
--
it
didn't
appear
in
the
immunity
provision
in
--
in
--
the
immunity
provision,
your
honor,
is
contained
in
the
latter
half
of
the
sentence.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
it
never
contained
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor,
that
--
that
--
the
first
part
applied
only
to
the
appropriation.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
and
so
it
--
it
was
never
included
in
15
u.s.c.
32.
if
we
confine
ourselves
to
the
immunity
provisional
alone
--
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
looking
at
the
immunity
provision
alone,
we
see
that
immunity
is
given
only
for
testimony
in
a
proceeding
under
said
acts,
namely
the
sherman
act
etcetera.
now,
hearings
of
congressional
committees
are
conducted
under
the
rules
adapted
by
either
house
and
or
as
in
the
instant
case,
under
a
special
resolution.
they
have
never
been
considered
proceedings
under
the
antitrust
laws.
so
that
even
confining
ourselves
to
the
latter
portion
of
that
sentence,
we
have
trouble
with
the
district
court's
decision.
if
we
read
it
in
context
in
relation
to
the
clause
immediately
preceding
it
on
page
9,
we
think
that
district
court's
error
becomes
quite
apparent.
the
first
clause,
your
honors
will
recall,
makes
a
special
additional
appropriation
for
the
attorney
general
to
conduct
proceedings,
suits
and
prosecutions
under
said
acts
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states.
and
in
the
next
succeeding
clause,
an
immunity
is
given
for
testimony
in
a
proceeding
suit
or
prosecution
under
said
acts.
now,
unless
the
same
phrase
"proceeding,
suit
or
prosecution"
in
the
two
successive
clauses
of
the
same
sentence
was
intended
to
have
different
meanings
and
there's
no
indication
of
any
such
intention,
then
we
submit
that
the
immunity
provision,
like
the
appropriation
provision
in
the
immediately
preceding
clause,
was
intended
to
apply
only
to
a
proceeding
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
will
come
to
that
but
first,
immunity
statute
ever
past
was
a
one
relating
specifically
to
testimony
before
a
congressional
committee.
i
should
like
to
come
to
that
in
a
minute.
not
long
after
this
statute
was
passed,
this
court
had
occasion
in
hale
versus
henkel
to
consider
the
applicability
that
the
type
of
proceeding
to
which
this
immunity
applies.
and
it
was
taken
for
granted
in
that
case
that
it
applied
only
to
a
judicial
proceeding.
the
only
question
there
was
whether
a
grand
jury
proceeding
was
a
judicial
proceeding.
i
should
like
to
say
a
word
about
the
legislative
history.
i
think
your
honors
will
find
i
--
that
the
legislative
history
shows
that
in
tacking
on
this
particular
paragraph
to
the
general
appropriations
act,
that
congress
meant
to
give
the
attorney
general
two
weapons,
one,
a
special
additional
appropriation
over
--
over
and
above
that
which
had
been
given
to
the
department
of
justice
and
two,
the
power
to
compel
testimony.
there
isn't
the
remotest
suggestion
that
immunity
was
intended
to
be
given,
isn't
the
remotest
suggestion
of
the
legislative
history
that
immunity
was
ever
meant
to
apply
to
a
hearing
before
a
congressional
committee.
now,
if
there
were
any
doubts
left
as
to
whether
or
not
congress
meant
for
its
committees
to
have
this
power,
we
think
those
doubts
will
be
dispelled
by
a
reference
to
the
history
of
what
congress
did
when
it
was
focusing
on
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
to
give
its
committees
this
power.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
now
i
come
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
harlan.
this
history
shows
that
after
some
rather
unhappy
experiences
under
an
1857
statute,
applying
specifically
to
testimony
given
before
congressional
committees,
congress,
by
unanimous
vote
of
both
houses,
repealed
it
and
refused
some
20
years
later
to
reinstate
the
provision
because
it
concluded,
and
i
will
spell
this
out
in
detail,
that
it
would
rather
not
give
its
committees
the
power
to
confer
immunity
even
though
this
meant,
they
would
be
without
the
power
to
compel
a
testimony,
than
give
its
committees
this
power
and
risk
serious
abuse
by
having
indictments
quashed
and
so
forth.
that
when
it
finally
did
give
its
committees
the
power
in
1954,
in
the
immunity
act
of
1954,
which
is
not
involved
here
for
construction,
it
did
so
reluctantly
and
only
under
carefully
prescribed
safeguards,
and
i
shall
spell
that
out.
the
1857
statute
to
which
i
referred,
applied
specifically
to
testimony
before
a
congressional
committee
and
gave
complete
immunity
from
prosecution.
this
was
repealed
in
five
years
by
unanimous
vote
--
vote
of
both
houses
as
a
result
of
many
indictments
being
quashed
because
of
the
indictees
appearing
before
congressional
committees.
one
was
a
very
dramatic
case
of
a
person
in
interior
stealing
or
being
accused
of
stealing
some
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
bonds
and
the
other
was
a
former
secretary
of
war
who
had
been
indicted
and
obtained
immunity
by
being
called
before
a
congressional
committee.
the
problem
came
up
again
in
1876
in
connection
with
the
impeachment
proceedings
of
secretary
of
war
belknap.
the
house
passed
a
bill,
which
in
substance,
sought
to
reinstate
the
1857
broad
immunity
provisions.
and
the
senate
fiercely
resisted
the
passage
of
this
bill,
recalled
in
its
lengthy
adverse
report,
the
unhappy
experiences
under
the
earlier
immunity
provision
which
applied
specifically
to
congressional
committees,
pointed
out
that
the
course
of
justice
would
better
be
served
with
--
without
this
provision
and
with
it,
made
reference
to
the
fact
that
there
are
75
standing
committees,
this
was
in
1876,
50
special
committees,
members
of
both
political
persuasions
on
this
committees
and
referred
to
the
serious
risk
of
abuse
of
this
power
given
to
its
committees.
now,
there
was
no
other
legislation
which
was
passed
between
1862
at
the
time
of
repeal
of
the
1857
provision.
in
1954,
when
congress
again
for
the
first
time
passed
the
immunity
act
of
1954
and
the
lengthy
debate
as
to
the
1954
act
was
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
any
immunity
should
be
given
to
its
congressional
committees.
and
when
it
was
finally
enacted,
the
statute
was
hedged
with
careful
safeguards.
if
--
if
congressional
committees
were
limited
in
their
power
to
confer
immunity
only
in
areas
of
the
national
defense
or
security,
the
witness
had
to
make
an
affirmative
claim
of
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
two-thirds
of
the
full
committee
had
to
vote
on
an
application
to
grant
immunity.
an
order
of
court
was
necessary.
the
attorney
general
had
to
be
noted
--
notified
at
each
proposed
grant
and
of
each
application
before
the
court
and
given
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
court
on
the
application
for
the
grant.
contrast
this
history,
your
honors,
and
the
care
--
the
care
with
which
congress
safeguarded
the
grant
of
the
immunization
power
when
it
finally
made
it
and
the
consequences
of
the
district
court's
decision,
under
the
district
court's
decision,
all
that
a
witness
needs
to
do
is
testify
in
response
to
a
subpoena.
no
need
to
claim
his
privilege
under
the
statute,
there's
no
need
for
a
vote
by
the
committee,
no
order
of
court
is
necessary,
the
attorney
general
need
not
be
notified,
all
he
does
is
testifies
and
he
gets
immunity.
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
such
a
construction
of
the
statute
should
not
be
made
unless
the
language
were
compelling.
and
here,
as
we
have
urged,
a
contrary
construction
is
compelling.
my
brother,
lewald,
will
refer
to
the
oral
opinion
of
a
district
judge
in
the
armour
case
decided
in
1906.
he
places
a
great
deal
of
reliance
on
that
case,
however,
that
was
a
case,
your
honors,
which
did
not
involve
testimony
before
a
congressional
committee.
it
is
true
that
in
that
case,
the
investigation
made
by
the
commissioner
of
corporations
of
the
beef
trust
was
made
pursuant
to
a
resolution
of
congress.
however,
in
that
case,
the
investigation
was
made
by
the
commissioner
of
corporations.
and
this
is
a
vital
distinction
because
the
whole
history
of
what
congress
wanted
done,
when
it
focused
on
the
problem
of
testimony
--
of
giving
its
committees
that
power,
was
to
draw
a
sharp
distinction
between
a
proceeding
before
a
congressional
committee
and
that
--
before
any
proceeding
in
the
courts
or
before
an
administrative
agency.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
yes,
your
honor.
the
commission
of
corporations
was
the
predecessor
of
the
federal
trade
commission
and
was
a
--
he
was
a
creature
of
the
act
which
created
the
department
of
commerce
in
1903.
and
the
commissioner
of
corporations
was
given
the
same
powers
to
compel
testimony
as
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
given
by
the
compulsory
testimony
act
of
1893.
now,
the
case
--
this
particular
case,
the
armour
case
involved
other
factors
with
which
i
didn't
want
to
burden
the
court.
but
in
that
case,
since
your
honors
asked,
in
that
case,
the
commissioner
of
corporations
had
investigated
some
of
the
meatpacking
companies
and
on
the
assurance
that
he
would
not
disclose
the
information
he
obtained
to
other
federal
agencies,
specifically
the
department
of
justice,
he
was
given
this
information.
it
was
not
a
proceeding
before
a
congressional
committee.
we
think
that
fact
is
dispositive.
nevertheless,
according
to
the
district
court,
the
commissioner
of
corporations
didn't
turn
that
over
to
the
depart
--
the
information
over
to
the
department
of
justice
and
that
is
a
fact
to
which
the
district
judge
in
his
oral
opinion,
refers
as
carrying
some
weight
in
the
course
of
this
decision.
thank
you.
mr.
irwin
a.
seibel
i
have
nothing
further,
your
honor.
