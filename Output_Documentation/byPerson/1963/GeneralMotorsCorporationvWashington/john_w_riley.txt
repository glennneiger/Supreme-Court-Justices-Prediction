mr.
john
w.
riley
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
find
that
it
might
--
we
--
it's
desirable
from
the
state's
standpoint
to
review
briefly
what
it
is
that
the
state
reports
to
tax.
and
then
i'd
like
to
approach
the
question
of
the
characterization
of
the
tax
and
consider
its
measure
and
then
answer
mr.
barnes'
due
process
contentions.
mr.
barnes'
statement
of
facts
has
emphasized
primarily
that
which
general
motors
does
without
the
state
and
it
seems
to
me,
he
lends
very
little
emphasis
upon
that
which
they
do
conduct
within
the
state.
he
concedes
that
there
are
manufacturer.
but
for
some
reason,
they
will
not
admit
that
they're
also
engaged
in
wholesaling
activities
within
the
state.
and
we
insist
that
the
facts
in
this
record
here,
which
are
quite
extensive,
they
are
unique
and
they
are
quite
detailed,
illustrate
fully
and
adequately
that
the
tax
fair
did
in
this
audit
periods
here
in
question
engaged
in
continuous
and
detailed
and
systematic
business
activities
within
the
state.
mr.
john
w.
riley
well,
that
relates
to
the
incidence
of
the
tax.
the
incidence
of
the
tax
is
on
the
act
or
privilege
of
engaging
in
business
activities,
and
then
under
the
act,
there
are
a
great
number
of
categories
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
--
manufacturing,
wholesaling,
retailing
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
--
services,
lawyers,
pay
the
tax
and
so
forth.
the
measure
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
the
measure
--
the
measure
is
the
--
is
the
proceeds
of
the
sales
resulting
from
the
business
activity.
and
the
measure
i
might
say
--
the
point
i'd
like
to
develop
later.
mr.
john
w.
riley
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
w.
riley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
riley
this
specific
tax.
yes,
your
honor.
and
we
think
it
is
quite
significant
in
this
case.
very
similar
we
believe
in
all
respects.
mr.
john
w.
riley
there
was
an
office,
your
honor,
which
was
--
they
had
a
--
a
great
number
of
salesmen
in
field
enterprises
within
the
state
who
were
soliciting
orders.
none
of
the
orders
were
accepted
within
the
state.
they
were
all
accepted
and
filled
outside
the
state,
points
that
are
similar
to
this
case.
the
salesmen
were
directed
from
this
office
by
a
manager
and
several
assistants
and
secretaries.
mr.
john
w.
riley
well,
the
salesmen
didn't
actually
work
out
of
the
office.
they
--
they
were
directed
from
the
office.
i
--
i
don't
believe
it's
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
they
had
salesman
engaged
in
all
types
of
promotional
activities.
i
don't
think
the
analysis
of
that
case
would
lend
itself
to
the
conclusion
that
they
were
soliciting
sales.
they
were
promoting
sales.
they
were
soliciting
customers.
they
were
transmitting
orders
outside
the
state
where
they
are
accepted,
i
guess.
mr.
john
w.
riley
in
this
case,
your
honor,
we
contend
that
it
is.
and
i'd
like
to
approach
that
indirectly.
and
it
--
it's
done
in
this
manner.
first
of
all,
we
--
mr.
barnes
has
discussed
in
considerable
detail,
the
instate
activities
of
the
resident
district
managers
and
service
managers
and
parts
managers.
these
gentlemen,
as
it
has
been
pointed
out,
laid
their
primary
emphasis
on
the
details
of
the
retail
dealership.
they
have
from
12
to
30
not
30
to
40
dealers,
i
think
the
record
shows.
and
they
spend
all
of
their
time
with
them.
now,
there
are,
of
course,
other
instate
activities
of
personnel
who
do
not
reside
in
the
state
and
there
are
also
other
activities
of
other
divisions
which
i'd
like
to
touch.
but
turning,
for
the
moment,
to
your
specific
question,
mr.
justice
white,
the
manner
in
which
we
--
sales
are
solicited
if
--
if
i
may
use
that
term
in
--
quite
broadly.
the
whole
object,
and
the
record
discloses
this
and
we've
cited
numerous
references
to
the
record,
that
the
whole
object
of
the
activity,
principally
of
these
resident
district
managers,
of
whom
there
were
some
27
for
the
three
divisions
with
which
you
were
concerned,
is
to
obtain
for
the
divisions
concerned
there
share
of
the
market.
and
they
did
it
by
working
with
the
dealers
and
forcing
and
seeking
compliance
with
the
detailed
terms
of
the
retail
dealer
selling
agreement,
which
we
think
is
a
very
significant
document.
and
they
do
it
initially
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
with
the
dealer
by
determining
what
that
dealer's
sales
objective
for
his
geographical
zone.
these
dealers
have
a
geographical
zone.
they're
all
stationed
all
around
in
strategic
market
areas
of
the
state.
the
state
has
a
sales
objective.
you
--
i
don't
like
--
i
can't
call
other
code.
i
was
never
ever
able
in
examining
the
various
witnesses
to
get
them
to
admit
that
it
was
a
code
but
it
is
a
sales
objective.
and
this
is
reduced
in
to
sales
objectives
for
a
district
and
is
reduced
then
to
sales
objectives
for
the
particular
member
or
retail
dealer,
member
of
the
dealer
organization.
and
it
is
then
administered
by
the
district
manager
as
it
is
stated
in
the
trial
court.
they
counsel
and
advised
him,
if
he
isn't
coming
up
to
his
projections
so
that
he
does
come
up
to
his
projections.
and
these
projections
come
in
the
form
of
an
exhibit,
i
believe
its
exhibit
11,
which
will
be
found
in
the
record.
mr.
john
w.
riley
yes,
indeed.
and
they're
constantly
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
--
striving
to
develop
their
share
of
the
market.
record
407,
exhibit
11,
shows
the
form
of
sales
projection.
and
in
the
zone
office
manual
which
is
reproduced
in
the
record,
it
is
stated
that
this
have
the
form
and
effect
though
they're
not
classically
in
order.
you
can't
take
the
thing
out
and
see
ordered
by
and
paid
for
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
it
is
to
be
treated
as
an
order
and
it
state
it
so
specifically
in
the
general
motors
zone
office
manual.
the
orders
about
which
we've
been
talking
here,
which
the
dealer
later
fills
out
and
sends
in
to
the
portland
zone
or
back
to
detroit
or
down
to
california,
as
a
little
form
which
is
in
the
record,
to
designate
the
color
and
the
type
of
accessories
for
a
particular
automobile
included
in
a
previously
submitted
sales
projection
which
is
exhibit
11
record
4.
this
whole
process
of
counseling
and
advising
the
dealers,
seeking
compliance
with
their
inventory
program,
what
could
be
more
essential
and
what
could
be
more
like
wholesaling
than
seeing
that
the
dealer
has
in
his
stock,
in
his
parts
inventory,
the
parts
program
and
--
and
the
requisite
quantity
of
parts
so
as
to
comply
with
the
general
motors
parts
program.
this
is
a
detail
in
the
zone
office
manuals
and
the
procedures
board
are
detailed
in
the
exhibits
and
in
the
record
here.
it
goes
farther
than
that.
it
includes
training
of
retail
dealer
salesmen,
sales
meetings
periodically
through
the
year.
it
includes
training
of
the
dealers'
mechanics
so
they
can
give
better
service
at
the
retail.
and
this
is
a
manner
in
which
they
complete
their
wholesale
sales
and
they
develop
their
market.
primary
emphasis
is
made
in
the
retail
dealership
as
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
said
these
activities
pervade
virtually
every
aspect
of
the
retail
dealers
operation.
this
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
so-called
"strong
retail
dealer"
or
"quality
dealer
program",
which
general
motors
maintains
and
has
maintained
throughout
the
other
periods
here
in
question.
they
even
counsel
and
advise
as
to
the
quantity
of
capital
they
have
to
have.
they
had
used
car
managers
who
counsel
and
advise
the
dealers
to
turn
over
used-cars
and
how
to
recondition
used-cards
because
it's
a
statistic
fact,
as
one
of
the
witnesses
said
that
the
greater
the
volume
of
used-car
sales,
you
have
more
capital
for
new
car
sales.
now
--
now,
perhaps
they've
omitted
a
great
many
other
types
of
activity
of
this
instate
personnel.
the
retail
--
incidentally,
these
district
mangers,
i
believe
the
record
shows,
all
reside
within
the
state
of
washington
with
the
exception
of
those
who
have
districts
along
the
border
and
a
district
then
may
overlap
the
columbia
river
and
have
a
county
in
oregon
and
a
county
in
washington
and
he
may
have
the
dealers
in
two
--
have
dealers
in
two
states.
these
then
are
some
of
the
activities
engaged
in
by
resident
personnel
instate
within
the
state
of
washington.
now,
those
district
managers
incidentally
used
their
homes.
they
have
a
telephone
number
at
home
but
they
--
for
most
part,
work
out
the
dealers'
place
of
business
according
to
our
witnesses.
now,
there
are
great
--
and
many
other
activities
i
have
included
in
my
previous
discussions.
some
of
the
functions
of
people
who
are
members
of
the
zone
office
staff
across
the
river
in
portland.
these
staffs,
i
believe
mr.
barnes
gave
you
the
figures,
the
number
of
people
that
were
there,
have
a
number
of
personnel
which
they
have
an
assistant
business
manager.
he
comes
in
and
out
of
a
dealer's
place
of
business
and
works
with
the
accountants
to
help
him
in
his
accounting
problems
to
see
that
the
forms
that
general
motors
requires
are
submitted
in
the
proper
manner.
mr.
john
w.
riley
from
oregon.
the
point
is,
mr.
justice
clark,
general
motors
wants
us
to
discount
and
to
disregard
entirely
instate
activities
of
these
people
from
out-of-state.
we
submit
that
it's
not
just
the
instate
activity
of
the
instate
residence
but
also
instate
act.
we
can
also
consider
and
should
consider
instate
activity
of
non-resident
personnel.
and
it
can't
be
totally
disregarded
just
because
they
happen
to
have
their
office
across
the
river
in
portland.
and
all
of
these
activities
lend
themselves
and
are
part
of
this
wholesaling
process.
and
they
all
have
contact
with
the
sales
through
the
extent,
they
all
--
meaning
these
activities,
all
have
contacts
with
the
ultimate
objective
of
consummating
sales
and
--
and
are
all
related
to
the
wholesaling
process
and
are
all
instate
activities.
the
significance
of
this
dealer
agreement,
the
dealer
selling
agreement
or
contract,
call
it
what
you
will,
and
mr.
barnes
refers
to
it
as
having
been
accepted
and
executed
out
--
out
of
the
state.
but
the
significance
of
it
is,
is
it
by
its
very
nature,
it
has
to
be
performed
in
the
state
of
washington,
and
it
is
administered
principally
within
the
state
of
washington.
and
now,
it's
true,
of
course,
if
the
dealer
goes
down
to
portland
and
sits
down
on
the
zone
manager's
office,
which
they
frequently
do,
well,
we
can't
purport
to
tax
that.
and
we're
not
concerned
about
that,
we're
concerned
only
with
those
acts
that
are
performed
within
the
state.
so
far
then,
instate
personnel
who
reside
there
and
out-of-state
personnel
who
frequently
stay,
incidentally
in
terms
of
population,
this
out-of-state
personnel
would
come
in
the
state
of
the
zone
that
was
described
by
mr.
barnes
that
population
wise,
half
of
the
population
of
that
area
is
in
the
state
of
washington,
so
that
it
might
be
concluded
that
most
of
those
people
spend
proportion
amounts
of
their
time
in
the
state.
of
course,
that
isn't
exactly
true
either
but
their
responsibilities
and
their
efforts
to
the
extent
that
they
are
performed
within
the
state
would
run
in
that
proportion
to
the
state.
mr.
john
w.
riley
many
of
them
are
in
retail
dealerships,
your
honor,
and
many
of
them
are
in
hotels.
they
--
it
depends
upon
the
type
of
the
showing
if
its
--
one
of
the
record
--
discussions
in
the
testimony
was
that
it
if
it
say
new
cars
showing
while
they
will
have
them
in
two
places
within
the
state,
sometimes,
some
of
the
dealers
within
the
state
will
go
down
to
oregon.
there
will
be
training
sessions
for
dealer
mechanics
maybe
in
oregon
and
maybe
in
the
state.
and
--
and
many
times
it's
within
dealers'
place
of
business.
there
are
many
times
there
are
meetings
within
a
district
so
that
the
dealers
or
the
salesmen
within
a
district,
attend
a
sales
training
session
within
a
district.
mr.
john
w.
riley
there
are
most
of
the
times,
were
no
--
were
no
fixed
places.
no,
your
honor.
now,
we
have
a
number
of
other
divisions
of
the
general
motors
organization
which
do
have
physical
facilities
within
a
state.
we
were
unable,
at
the
time
of
trial,
to
amplify
their
activities
and
to
develop
the
significance
of
those
activities
with
respect
to
the
activities
of
the
three
divisions
that
we
have
here,
several
of
them
were
described,
one
is
general
motors
acceptance
corporation,
one
is
motors
insurance
corporation,
one
is
motors
holding
division,
one
is
united
motors
service
division,
and
i
shouldn't
have
said
motors
insurance
corporation
or
motors
holding
division
that
this
because
it
never
had
an
office
within
the
state.
but
it
does
come
into
play
because
in
the
process
maintaining
and
developing
this
retail
dealer
organization,
occasionally
what
is
known
in
the
trade
as
an
"open
point"
will
occur.
and
it's
necessary
to
get
a
dealer
in
there
to
occupy
that
geographical
area
and
to
obtain,
using
the
terms
of
the
trade
again,
they're
share
of
the
market
which
general
motors
thinks
it
ought
to
have
or
the
chevrolet
division
of
general
motors
or
whatever
the
case
might
be.
and
during
that
--
at
the
time
of
the
deposition
of
chevrolet,
pontiac
and
oldsmobile
people,
from
one
to
three
dealerships,
were
being
financed
by
a
motors
holding
division
of
general
motors
and
the
--
that
works
by
--
motors
holding
division
holding
about
50%
of
the
stock,
i
presume
51%
of
the
stock
of
these
particular
dealerships
to
assist
it
in
its
financing
and
to
assist
it
to
become
eventually,
i
presume,
independent
but
another
effort
which
can
hardly
be
not
essential,
certainly
is
directly
related
to
the
consummation
of
wholesale
transactions.
now,
returning
to
a
moment
to
this
other
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
i
would,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
--
white,
because
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
well,
perhaps,
not.
at
some
point,
you
have
to
exceed
the
minimum,
say
of
nippert
versus
richmond.
in
its
brief,
general
motors
really
wants
to
characterize
its
activities
as
occasional
forays
into
the
state
of
washington.
and
if
you
don't
exceed
that
minimum,
well,
presumably,
we'd
be
precluded
from
taxation
by
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
--
by
that.
mr.
john
w.
riley
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
i
wouldn't
have
any
idea
as
to
the
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
--
numbers,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
riley
of
--
of
three
resident
personnel?
mr.
john
w.
riley
at
least
three
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
oh,
i
--
i
insist.
mr.
john
w.
riley
oh,
i'm
talking
about
pontiac
also.
mr.
john
w.
riley
i'm
talking
also
about
pontiac.
in
addition
to
the
three
resident
personnel
of
pontiac,
we
have
at
least
three
non-resident
personnel
who
come
in
from
the
portland
zone
office,
and
we
have
other
contributions
made
by
other
divisions
of
general
motors
to
which
i
will
now
direct
myself.
that,
i
believe,
is
systematic
and
continuous
enough
to
meet
the
nippert
versus
richmond
rule.
just
those
first
six
individual
as
i
mentioned,
and
i'll
admit
that
it
is
very,
perhaps,
close
to
the
line.
but
it
is
systemic
and
it
is
continuous
and
it
is
effective
and
it
is
necessary
and
essential
to
the
consummation
of
the
sales
by
which
the
tax
is
measured.
but
there
are
other
contributions
as
well
that
i
don't
think
should
be
discounted.
for
instance,
what
could
be
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
if
a
sale
is
consummated
or
is
made
to
a
resident
of
the
state
of
washington
which
with
those
activities
had
nothing
to
do,
it
will
not
be
included
in
the
measure
of
the
tax.
if
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
i'm
afraid
we
couldn't,
in
that
example.
if
--
if
pontiac
made
a
fleet
sale
of
100
automobiles
to
a
particular
corporation
and
--
it
was
conducted
all
in
oregon
or
all
in
detroit,
we
couldn't
include
those
100
automobiles
in
the
measure
of
the
tax
and
would
not.
this
is
established
by
the
norton
decision
and
is
established
by
field
enterprise
and
is
established
by
the
goodrich
case
and
the
horsman
case.
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
riley
additional
instate
activities
of
other
divisions
which
are
essential
to
and
are
--
the
maintenance
of
this
operation
and
are
essential
to
the
acquisition
of
general
motors'
share
of
the
market
as
it's
--
for
instance,
what
can
be
more
essential
than
the
actual
financing
of
the
merchandise
on
a
dealer
showroom
floor?
mr.
john
w.
riley
those
activities
of
general
motors
acceptance
corporation
to
the
extent
that
it's
measured
by
its
income
from
financing
or
tax,
to
be
sure,
your
honor.
we
are
submitting,
however,
that
these
efforts
of
these
other
divisions,
even
united
motor
service
division,
even
the
parts
warehouse,
all
contribute
to
the
development
and
the
establishment
and
the
acquisition
of
its
share
of
the
market
and
in
the
end
run,
the
consummation
of
this
wholesale
sales
by
which
the
tax
is
to
be
measured.
united
motor
service
only
had
one
operation.
the
parts
division
warehouse
i
believe
had
17
to
20.
it
varied
from
year
to
year
or
maybe
it
goes
as
high
as
28.
but
the
very
existence
of
that
parts
warehouse
within
the
state
of
washington
and
made
it
--
able
--
made
general
motors
able
to
develop
public
confidence
in
the
products,
to
develop
reliance
of
the
dealers,
to
develop
the
effectiveness
of
the
dealers
and
to
develop
the
very
effectiveness
of
the
efforts
of
these
gentlemen
who
were
residents
of
and
were
engaged
entirely
inside
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
john
w.
riley
this
warehouse
has
only
so-called
"fast
moving
parts",
mr.
justice
clark,
that
which
had
to
be
really
and
able
and
more
centrally
located.
another
parts
warehouse
is
located
in
--
well,
those
for
which
there's
a
greater
demand
on
a
higher
rate
of
turnover
i
believe,
sir.
mr.
john
w.
riley
and
of
course,
i
don't
want
to
add
any
confusion
for
the
--
the
question
here
by
suggesting
that
there's
any
question
as
to
the
distribution
of
parts
out
of
that
parts
warehouse.
general
motors,
as
mr.
barnes
i
believe
has
stated,
pays
its
tax
with
respect
to
sales
from
the
seattle
warehouse,
parts
that
move
through
the
seattle
warehouse
to
its
ultimate
dealer.
we
submit,
however,
that
the
efforts
of
the
individuals,
district
managers
included,
justify
and
the
contributions
made
by
the
seattle
parts
warehouse,
justify
the
inclusion
in
the
measure
of
the
tax
of
sales
out
in
portland
warehouse.
i'll
develop
that
a
little
bit
later
when
we
approach
the
question
of
the
measure
of
this
tax.
mr.
john
w.
riley
well,
the
cadillac
division,
i
don't
know
that
it's
any
different
the
--
than
--
than
this
one
here,
your
honors,
but
i
--
i
really
can't
say.
i
believe
it's
probably
be
quite
similar
to
pontiac
and
oldsmobile,
probably,
a
little
smaller
organization.
mr.
john
w.
riley
that's
--
that
is
true
but
we
don't
have
any
sales
by
the
cadillac
division
involved
in
this
particular
case.
i
don't
know
whether
they're
paying
the
tax
or
have
paid
the
tax
or
--
or
just
what
the
question
--
problem
is,
if
there's
any.
mr.
john
w.
riley
it
is
the
same
corporation,
yes,
your
honor.
well,
the
summation
under
this
factual
approach
that
i've
tried
to
make,
if
the
court
please,
is
that
when
all
of
these
activities
of
general
motors
personnel
inside
the
state
of
washington
are
considered
in
the
light
of
these
physical
facilities
described
in
exhibit
13,
even
though
they
may
have
been
independently
and
they
do
operate
substantial
independent
of
the
three
divisions
with
which
we
are
concerned.
but
the
whole
gamut
of
this
activity
indicates
a
systematic
and
continuous
course
of
conduct.
and
the
question
we
have
to
approach
is
whether
or
not
that
gamut,
if
you
will,
of
instate
activity
is
immune
from
any
kind
of
state
taxation.
i
--
i'd
like
to
begin
with
this
premise
and
then
i
should
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
then
to
the
question
of
whether
the
measure
is
by
its
nature
offensive
constitutionally
and
then
consider
the
remaining
due
process
and
constitutional
questions
suggested
by
mr.
barnes.
one
preliminary
problem,
mr.
barnes
touched
only
very
lightly
on
it
in
his
discussion
but
it
is
in
his
brief,
and
that's
the
problem
of
the
characterization
of
this
particular
tax.
the
tax
is
a
tax
on
persons
or
corporations
for
the
act
or
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
business
activities.
in
his
brief,
counsel
invokes
the
decision
of
this
court
in
spector
motor
service
versus
o'connor
and
in
which
this
court
found
that
a
tax
placed
--
the
--
the
tax
there
was
placed
unequivocally
upon
the
corporation's
franchise
for
the
privilege
of
curing
on
what
the
court
described
as
exclusively
interstate
transportation.
and
they
said,
justice
frankfurter
i
believe
said
that
the
tax
by
the
state
court's
own
characterization
impinged
upon
an
unconstitutional
channel.
and
he
observed
that
the
state
wasn't
precluded
from
opposing
upon
activities
or
aspects
of
the
business
within
the
state
unlike
the
privilege
of
engaging
an
interstate
transportation.
mr.
john
w.
riley
we've
approached
in
both
manners,
if
the
court
please.
we
--
we
are
willing
to
approach
--
approach
it
from
this
standpoint
that
--
you
see
this
local
store
argument
is
--
is
actually
separate
from
the
question
of
characterization.
i
think
mr.
barnes'
real
argument
is
that
in
order
to
include
these
sales
in
the
measured
tax,
you
have
to
have
a
local
store
to
which
those
sales
are
channeled
or
funneled
before
it's
constitutionally
proper
to
measure
the
tax
by
the
such
amounts.
we
believe
that
that
isn't
the
proper
test
if
the
question
is
--
is
whether
or
not,
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
instate
activities
and
that
then
whether
or
not
the
sales
are
--
are
result
thereof.
mr.
john
w.
riley
yes,
they
are
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
riley
no,
we
don't.
we
--
we
do
assert
and
do
respectively
submit
that
their
existence
there
does
contribute
to
the
development
of
this
market
and
to
the
conduct
to
these
wholesaling
activities
and
to
the
extent
that
they
do
contribute
that
it
is
instate
activity
which
maybe
taxed
and
maybe
measured
in
this
manner.
mr.
john
w.
riley
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
w.
riley
they
were
--
that's
--
no,
that's
right.
mr.
john
w.
riley
there
would
be
no
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
that's
right.
mr.
john
w.
riley
the
first
question.
mr.
john
w.
riley
i
will
say
we're
relying
impart.
i
don't
think
it's
essentially
on
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
yes.
mr.
john
w.
riley
yes,
it
would,
your
honors.
mr.
john
w.
riley
we
think
that
norton
and
field
enterprise
both
supports.
mr.
john
w.
riley
very
definitely.
mr.
john
w.
riley
no.
mr.
john
w.
riley
it
is.
it
is
a
separate
corporation.
mr.
john
w.
riley
well,
that
raises
an
interesting
question.
one
of
the
cases
cited
by
mr.
barnes
was
spector
--
scripto
incorporated
versus
carson,
that's
a
florida
case,
in
which
independent
contractors
imputed
presence
to
a
corporation.
certainly,
if
it
were
not
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
and
were
only
a
division,
i
could
impute
it.
so
i
see
no
reason
why
the
activities
of
the
wholly
owned
subsidiary
even
though
it's
incorporated
shouldn't
also
be
imputed
and
shouldn't
also
contribute.
mr.
john
w.
riley
well,
true,
that
was
a
sales
tax
question
and
--
however,
these
two
imputing
presence
through
an
independent
contractor
certainly
bares
analogy
to
that
question.
mr.
john
w.
riley
parts
were
analysis
in
seattle
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
--
in
seattle,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
riley
it
serves
the
state.
it
also
serves
other
--
other
--
i
think
alaska
and
parts
of
idaho
and
montana.
now
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
united
motor
service
division,
motors
insurance
corporation
had
three
offices
i
believe
and
general
motors
acceptance
corporation.
mr.
john
w.
riley
united
motor
service,
as
the
transcript,
shows
has
to
do
with
making
warranty
adjustments
on
accessories,
automobiles
and
supplies
parts
and
service
to
parts,
accessories
i
mean.
mr.
john
w.
riley
it
is
a
division,
yes.
it
is
a
division.
mr.
john
w.
riley
parts
--
the
parts
division.
now,
the
parts
division
is
a
little
bit
confusing
awhile
because
they
are
actually
serviced
by
the
district
managers
and
the
parts
and
accessories
personnel
for
the
particular
division
by
the
pontiac,
oldsmobile
and
chevrolet
divisions.
and
there
--
the
efforts
on
--
and
the
sales
of
some
of
these
parts
actually
proceed
from
the
activities
of
those
people
in
administering
those
portions
of
the
dealer
selling
agreement
which
require
the
dealer
to
maintain
its
balance
inventory
program
which
we
have
addressed
ourselves
earlier.
mr.
john
w.
riley
yes,
your
honor.
returning
just
--
just
for
a
moment
on
spector,
and
i
don't
think
it
deserves
anything
else,
this
--
this
question
of
characterization
of
the
tax
and
it
was
--
general
motors
can
persist
and
this
relates
to
our
disagreement
with
them
over
characterization
of
the
tax
which
we
have
discussed
in
our
brief
but
they
persistently
attempt
to
classify
the
--
our
tax
as
something
like
a
tax
on
unapportioned
tax
on
gross
receipts
from
interstate
commerce
or
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
doing
things
done
almost
exclusively
outside
the
state.
and
we
just
insist
that
the
washington
courts'
characterization
of
the
tax
that
it
is
a
--
a
tax
on
--
after
a
privilege
of
engaging
an
instate
activities
has
to
stand
and
we
think
it
wasn't
in
fact
established
and
is
established
by
this
court's
affirmance
of
the
states
supreme
courts
decision
in
field
enterprise,
as
well
as
in
norton.
this
gamut
then
of
local
business
activity
by
which
we've
been
discussing
engaged
in
within
the
state
by
this
general
motors
personnel,
pontiac,
chevrolet
and
oldsmobile
with
the
assistance
of
these
other
facilities
and
personnel
of
other
divisions
is
--
is
all
of
that,
in
a
nutshell,
immune
from
any
kind
of
state
taxation
and
i
--
i
asked
the
court
to
consider
that
question
preliminary
and
then
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
measure
question.
initially,
certainly,
there
is,
i
don't
think
it
can
be
denied,
an
incident
of
state
taxation
and
that
it
is
not
a
pure
interstate
commerce
or
interstate
commerce
per
se
in
the
nature
of
nippert
versus
richmond.
and
the
reason
being,
as
i
have
stated
early
that
this
is
a
systematic
and
a
continuous
course
of
conduct
and
it
results
in
a
large
volume
of
business.
and
again,
i
think
that
field
enterprises
certainly
establishes
the
fact
as
does
norton
that
it's
not
an
--
so
--
so
much
a
part
of
interstate
commerce
that
--
that
it
is
immune.
so
there's
a
taxable
incident.
now
then,
is
the
measure
of
the
washington
tax
somehow
make
this
tax
or
the
manner
which
it
is
operated
repugnant
or
is
it
put
it
outside
the
pail
of
this
various
constitutional
limitations?
i
think,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
measure
of
the
tax
is
the
same
for
all
wholesalers
doing
business
in
the
state
of
washington.
this
is
shown
by
goodrich.
the
measure
results
in
a
tax,
if
you
please,
which
is
proportional
to
the
results
of
this
sales
efforts
and
this
wholesaling
activities
engaged
in
within
the
state
as
contrasted
to
the
situation
in
nippert
versus
richmond,
the
flatfeet
situation.
and
as
i've
mentioned
earlier
and
as
illustrated
by
our
state
supreme
court's
decision
in
the
goodrich
rubber
case
as
well
as
norton
and
goodrich,
the
state
supreme
court
applied
this
--
diligently,
i
might
add,
this
court's
decision
in
norton.
so
that
the
measure
of
the
tax,
and
we
--
as
we
said
earlier,
excludes
any
transactions
or
sales,
if
you
will,
to
a
washington
customer
with
which
the
tax
payers'
instate
activity
had
nothing
to
do.
i
think
this
is
made
abundantly
clear
by
goodrich.
mr.
john
w.
riley
well,
your
honor,
you
mean
in
all
of
the
tax
here?
mr.
john
w.
riley
actually,
not.
mr.
john
w.
riley
no,
your
honor,
we
are
able
to
agree
that
if
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
well,
that's
--
that's
counsels
due
process
argument
that
it
is
out
of
proportion
to
the
benefits
which
the
state
is
conferred.
mr.
john
w.
riley
well,
the
state
supreme
court
has
held
and
--
and
did
declare
in
their
review
that
the
--
the
tax,
this
is
a
confusing
measure
of
the
incidence,
but
the
tax
was
reasonably
related
and
they
disposed
of
counsel's
contention
that
it
is
--
does
not
bare
reasonable
relationship
in
that
manner.
does
that
answer
you
question,
your
honor?
there
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
that
is
the
due
process.
mr.
john
w.
riley
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
john
w.
riley
that
--
that
is
our
view.
mr.
john
w.
riley
all
of
the
tax
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
they
--
they
assert,
first,
that
the
tax
is
on
interstate
commerce
and
secondly,
they
assert
that
all
of
these
sales
are
out-of-state
or
not
related
to
a
sufficient
quantity
of
instate
activity
and
don't
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
--
pass
through
a
local
store.
mr.
john
w.
riley
that's
true,
but
also
--
also
the
question
of
law.
let
me
address
my
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
they
--
they
assert
that
the
tax
--
none
of
the
--
none
of
these
transactions,
your
honor,
that
general
motors
is
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
well,
that's
true.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
riley
i'm
sorry,
then
i
misunderstood
justice
black's
inquiry.
mr.
john
w.
riley
well,
i
don't
understand
that
to
be
raised
here,
your
honor.
the
one
that
mr.
justice
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
--
stewart
raised
is
the
argument.
now,
one
other
thing
regarding
this
measure,
i
think
it's
a
--
while
we
contend
that
those
sales
which
are
related
to
these
instate
activities
can
be
--
be
a
proper
measure
to
tax.
the
alternative
is,
and
i
think
this
is
made
quite
clear
by
this
court's
decisions
in
gwin,
white
&
prince
and
henneford,
is
that
no
other
state
may
measure
a
tax
by
the
same
measure
and
by
the
gross
proceeds
of
those
sales.
and
mr.
barnes'
statement
to
the
contrary,
i
just
not
--
i
just
do
not
believe
will
stand
examination
because
gwin,
white
&
prince
and
henneford
and
other
cases
before
and
since
make
it
quite
clear
that
no
other
state
can
subject
general
motors
to
a
wholesaling
activity.
gwin,
white
&
prince
and
henneford
was
a
case
from
the
state
of
washington
involving
the
same
tax.
only
it
was
with
respect
to
outgoing
sales
by
a
producer
state.
mr.
john
w.
riley
simply
because
--
it's
one
of
the
reasons
gwin,
white
&
prince
and
henneford
says
they
cannot.
mr.
john
w.
riley
they
can
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
not
in
the
light
of
gwin,
white
&
prince
and
henneford,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
riley
well,
at
--
no
it
isn't.
i'll
--
i'll
--
they
want
for
one
good
reason,
wholesaling
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
well,
oregon
can
no
more
--
oregon
can
no
more
measure
a
tax
by
sales
to
washington
customers
than
we
can
measure
a
tax
by
sales
to
oregon
customers,
a
wholesaling
tax.
mr.
john
w.
riley
well
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
--
that's
a
question
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
well,
then
we
have
confused
the
question
of
measure
with
instance,
and
if
you
please,
mr.
justice
white,
because
then
you're
assuming
that
the
tax
is
a
tax
on
the
sales
and
not
a
tax
on
the
activities.
mr.
john
w.
riley
but
constitutionally,
you
--
we
cannot,
the
state
of
washington
cannot
measure
a
tax
on
general
motors
by
sales
to
any
other
state
and
the
state
of
washington
by
the
same
token
the
state
of
oregon
may
not
measure
a
sale
with
respect
to
activities
carried
on
there
in
--
by
general
motors
in
oregon,
may
not
measure
it
by
sales
to
washington
customer
--
by
the
gross
proceeds
of
sales.
mr.
john
w.
riley
if
it
was
a
tax
on
sales,
we
would
be
out
of
business.
mr.
john
w.
riley
alright.
if
it
were
to
--
to
be
--
but
sales
to
oregon
customers,
if
there
are
sales
to
washington
customer
consummated
in
oregon,
we
will
contend
that
we
have
a
right
to
tax
them,
to
measure
the
tax
by
them
and
not
to
tax
the
sales.
mr.
john
w.
riley
yes,
it
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
well,
that
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
that's
the
reason
i've
dwelt
to
this
length,
the
length
that
i
have
on
this
caution
of
measure.
and
i
think
it's
--
it's
quite
important
to
--
to
note
this
distinction
between
measure
and
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
riley
and
oregon
could
if
the
sale
we're
consummated
in
oregon.
oregon
could
not
because
the
actual
sale
isn't
consummated
there
either
and
this
particular
case
which
is
unassigned.
now
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
well,
this
is
not
a
sales
tax.
we
are
measuring
and
--
and
it's
just
that
needed
distinction.
it
is
a
conceptual
difference
to
be
sure
but
as
one
which
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
in
many
cases.
we
are
taxing
business
activities.
we
are
measuring
the
tax
by
the
sales
which
result
from
those
business
activities.
but
sales
only
to
washington
customers
and
not
including
sales
to
anybody
else
and
not
including
sales
with
which
those
activities
had
nothing
to
do.
i
think
this
is
a
--
this
bares
this
question
in
mr.
barnes'
discussion
earlier
of
the
market
state
concept.
and
he
describes
within
his
brief
as,
and
did
orally
this
morning,
as
something
like
when
products
are
sold
by
out-of-state
manufacturer
to
residents
in
the
state,
then
that
alien
manufacturer
has
taken
money
out-of-state
and
so
you
should
be
a
part
of
put
some
money
back
in.
we
don't
think
that
the
lower
court
had
anything
the
kind
in
mind.
if
it
did,
then
i
can't
determine
it
by
reading
the
opinion,
but
if
it
did,
it
might
well
had
considered
the
market
state
concept
that
justice
rutledge
announced
in
his
concurring
opinions
in
freeman
and
hewit
and
the
international
harvester
versus
the
department
of
the
treasurer.
his
--
he
was
speaking
there
with
the
reference
to
difference
types
of
taxes
but
the
analysis
still
applies
and
he
saw
three
alternatives
in
this
particular
situation,
which
--
which
i
note
that
you
seemed
to
be
concerned,
that
first,
you
could
prohibit
all
taxes
unless
they
were
apportioned
or
you
could
allow
either
the
producer
state
or
the
market
state,
but
not
both,
or
you
could
go
along
determine
that
factual
in
each
case.
and
he
said,
in
those
opinions,
he
said,
"i
think
the
solution
most
nearly
in
accord
with
the
commerce
clause
that
once
most
consistent
with
its
--
at
least
most
consistent
with
its
purpose
and
least
objectionable
for
producing
other
evils
would
be
the
vested
power
tax
in
a
state
of
market
subject
to
the
power
of
the
forwarding
state,
also
the
tax
by
allowing
credit
to
the
full
amount
of
any
tax
paid
or
do
at
the
destination."
now,
when
justice
rutledge
was
speaking,
norton
and
field
hadn't
been
decided
and
i
think
it
would
be
well
in
this
particular
case
if
this
court
did
specifically
invoke
what
justice
rutledge
was
saying
there,
although
we're
not
talking
about
taxing
sales.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court
may
have
--
we
believe
that
you
already
have
done
so
in
view
of
the
decisions
in
norton
and
field.
because
in
the
first
place,
the
producer
states,
because
of
the
doctrine
of
gwin,
white
&
prince
and
henneford
in
subsequent
decisions,
cannot
measure
the
tax
by
sales
towards
any
customers
any
more
than
we
can
measure
tax
of
--
gm
by
it's
sales
to
oregon
customers.
and
the
third
alternative
would
be
a
little
bit
intolerable
for
the
court.
now
then,
a
question
has
been
raised
about
the
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
it
may
impose
a
tax
on
manufacturing
quite
literally.
mr.
john
w.
riley
measured
by
gross
receipts.
mr.
john
w.
riley
measured
by
gross
receipts
to
washington
customers.
mr.
john
w.
riley
the
tax
is
on
manufacturing
and
i
think
they
have
a
right
to
tax
manufacturing
and
i
think
it
--
that
that's
been
established,
american
manufacturing
versus
st.
louis.
by
the
same
token
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
w.
riley
sure,
they
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
with
respect
to
due
process.
mr.
john
w.
riley
with
respect
to
due
process.
they
are
manufacturers
but
they're
also
wholesalers.
and
if
manufacturing
is
separable
from
interstate
commerce
and
can
be
taxed,
so
can
the
wholesaling
process
or
instate
business
activities
within
the
state
and
norton
and
field
clearly
established
that.
mr.
john
w.
riley
they
cannot.
first,
we're
not
taxing
sales.
no,
i
--
i
--
fairly,
i'm
not
making
myself
clear,
mr.
justice
white,
that
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
to
washington?
mr.
john
w.
riley
i
--
well,
i
--
on
the
due
process
question,
yes.
mr.
john
w.
riley
well,
mr.
justice
white
is
on
this
interstate
commerce
clause.
mr.
john
w.
riley
i
don't
see
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
john
w.
riley
i
think
you
determine
it
by,
(a)
saying
what
the
incident
is
it
--
is
it
a
local
incident?
(b)
you
did
--
is
the
measure
fair?
will
it
discriminate
against
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
--
interstate
commerce?
and
(c)
is
the
burden
of
a
tax
disproportionate
to
the
benefits
conferred
by
the
state?
mr.
john
w.
riley
in
that
order.
mr.
john
w.
riley
no,
measured
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
measured
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
well,
alright,
measured
by
the
whole
--
the
proceeds
of
sale,
yes.
mr.
john
w.
riley
and
i
see
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
it
may
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
--
under
norton
and
fields.
mr.
john
w.
riley
it
cannot
tax
sales
to
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
it
cannot
tax
business
activities
in
the
state
measured
by
sales
to
a
washington
customer.
mr.
john
w.
riley
it
is
taxing
manufacturing.
mr.
john
w.
riley
oregon
can't
tax
manufacturing.
mr.
john
w.
riley
washington
can't
tax
manufacturing.
mr.
john
w.
riley
it
has
contributed
something.
but
because
it
would
--
you
would
including
--
if
you're
including
in
the
measure
sales
to
the
state
of
washington,
then
we're
squarely
within
the
holding
of
gwin,
white
&
prince
and
henneford
and
you
can't
do
it.
and
that
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
--
this
is
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
mr.
john
w.
riley
well,
perhaps
not.
the
--
the
point
is
that
we
have
two
different
incidents,
two
different
processes
and
two
different
states.
now,
as
to
any
manufacturer
in
the
state
of
washington,
the
tax
is
identical
to
anybody
in
the
state
of
washington,
as
to
wholesaling
per
se.
but
in
--
you
can't
tax
this
process
in
oregon
measured
by
sales
to
washington.
you
can
tax
if
measured
by
sales
to
oregon.
mr.
john
w.
riley
if
that
is
so,
then,
sir,
what
is
happening
is
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
you're
taxing
in
--
well,
i've
missed
the
point
here.
we're
taxing
instate
activities.
mr.
john
w.
riley
that
they
cannot
tax
if
measured
by
sales
to
washington
customers.
they
cannot
measure
their
tax
by
sales
to
washington
customers.
mr.
john
w.
riley
we
can
because
the
act
related
to
the
activities
engaged
within
the
state
by
the
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
oh,
i
believe
it
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
riley
that's
right
and
asking
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
oh,
it's
been
--
it's
been
acknowledged
and
it
is
established
to
that
in
--
in
a
long
line
of
cases
that
it
is
not
a
sales
tax
because
the
incidents
in
sales
taxation
fall,
if
the
tax
falls
on
the
sale
itself.
and
--
and
if
you
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
that
is
right.
but
the
court
on
the
other
hand
has
held
that
you
can
measure
it
by
interstate
sales
and
this
was
done
in
field
enterprise
certainly,
and
it
was
done
in
--
in
goodrich
and
it
was
done
in
norton.
mr.
john
w.
riley
oh,
well,
it
is
--
it
is
and
--
and
to
the
extent
that
the
state
has
limited
its
application
and
so
declared
it
in
their
decisions
to
this
court's
construct
--
construction
of
the
situation
in
norton.
and
--
and
this
is
announced
clearly
in
the
goodrich
case.
mr.
john
w.
riley
of
sales.
mr.
john
w.
riley
but
sales
related
to
and
proceeding
from
those
instate
activities.
mr.
john
w.
riley
oh,
yes.
mr.
john
w.
riley
if
it
were
to
do
so,
it
would
be
imposing
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
--
measured
by
washington.
mr.
john
w.
riley
well,
then
we
would
have
to
overturn
norton,
gwin,
white
&
prince
and
hennerford
and
the
field
decision
this
court
--
which
--
which
this
court
stated.
and
i
submit
that
in
the
analysis
of
those
decisions
makes
our
position
quite
logical
and
quite
reasonable.
and
it
does
not
impose
a
burden
on
our
case.
it
does
not
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce.
and
you
can
only
be
said
to
be
a
double
tax
if
we
are
forced
to
lump
together
manufacturing
and
wholesaling
as
one
process
and
only
one
process.
mr.
john
w.
riley
well,
that
--
that
brings
us
to
this
precise
and
perhaps
the
most
important
question
here.
just
exactly
how
does
this
work?
we
contend
that
we
have
an
ample
quantity
of
local
activity
and
we
have
physical
facilities
and
then
we
have
a
continuous
and
systematic
process
that's
subject
to
tax,
so
why
can't
we
measure
it
by
a
gross
proceeds?
now
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
--
the
question
is,
why
--
all
of
this
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
that.
what
you're
saying
is
and
this
is
one
of
counsel's
argument
is
that
the
sine
qua
non
of
this
taxation
is
going
to
be
whether
you
have
this
local
store
through
which
the
sale
is
processed,
that
this
order
for
this
particular
sale
has
to
go
through
the
local
store
or
has
to
be
filled
from
the
store.
well,
this
is
--
this
brings
us
to
this
point
which
is
an
important
one
i'd
like
to
face
right
now.
i
--
and
i
say,
is
it
to
be
that
which
is
what
general
motors
argues
or
shall
the
test
be
the
nature
and
extent
and
scope
of
this
local
activity
and
its
relationship
to
these
sales
which
we
would
include
in
the
measure.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
be
an
arbitrary
test
rendering
that
you
could
have
any
amount
of
local
activity
in
the
state,
have
10,000
people
in
there,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
you
didn't
have
a
store
which
touched
those
sales
somehow
or
those
sales
orders
or
had
something
to
do
with
them
or
they
wouldn't
be
taxable
if
you
have
to
draw
such
an
arbitrary
line
as
that.
mr.
john
w.
riley
if
it
is
--
as
in
nippert,
occasional
or
an
occasional
foray
in
and
out
of
the
state,
it
wouldn't
be
difficult.
mr.
john
w.
riley
all
we
have
to
have
more
than
nippert.
we
have
to
have
substantial.
we
have
to
have
systematic
and
continuous
operations
within
the
state.
i
think
we
have
that.
i
think
we
have
vastly
more
than
--
in
nippert
or
in
any
type
of
--
i
think
new
have
vastly
more
than
in
field
enterprises
and
in
any
of
the
taxable
transactions
in
norton.
we
don't
have
this
local
store
as
we
did
in
norton
to
which
the
sales
orders
were
processed.
mr.
john
w.
riley
well,
they
had
a
warehouse,
yes.
mr.
john
w.
riley
it's
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
--
it's
the
position
taken
by
justice
rutledge.
mr.
john
w.
riley
i
think
this
is
true.
mr.
john
w.
riley
the
test
is
that
we
are
not
taxing
anything
down
in
oregon.
if
we
have
substantial
activity
legitimately
subject
to
taxation
in
the
state
of
washington,
i
don't
think
it
can
be
argued
really
that
they
aren't
doing
anything
which
is
not
taxable
somehow.
mr.
john
w.
riley
and
if
we
measure
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
the
test
--
the
test
would
be
--
we
don't
have
to
be
concerned
with
what
they're
doing
in
oregon.
if
the
activities
in
washington
are
essential
to
these
sales,
if
they
are
substantial,
if
they
are
systematic
and
continuous
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
--
i
don't
know
why
we
can't.
mr.
john
w.
riley
that's
right.
mr.
john
w.
riley
i
don't'
understand
your
point,
your
honor,
simply
because
--
if
--
if
it's
all
done
in
oregon,
we
couldn't
tax.
there
wouldn't
be
anything
in
washington
that
had
any
relation
to
washington
sales.
mr.
john
w.
riley
certainly.
mr.
john
w.
riley
i'd
still
--
i
still
say
washington
as
long
as
what
was
done
in
washington
is
essential
to
the
consummation
of
those
sales
and
for
one
reason,
oregon
can't.
it
would
then
be
a
direct
burden
according
to
gwin,
white
&
prince.
the
--
the
last
question
then
was
due
process
and
i
have
to
apologize
for
mr.
malone,
who
has
worked
with
me
for
four
years
in
this
case
and
we
had
hope
to
share
the
argument
and
we've
nearly
used
their
time
on
this
due
process,
i
think
by
the
same
token
as
follows
that
there
is
a
proportional
relationship
and
there
is
a
reasonable
relationship
between
the
tax
and
the
--
that
is
conferred
or
privileges,
if
you
will,
and
conferred
upon
general
motors
within
the
state.
if
we
analyze
the
tax,
first,
by
considering
the
scope
and
gamut
of
this
activity,
i
think
it
has
to
be
conceded
that
there's
something
there
that's
taxable,
certainly,
isn't
immune.
if
you
consider
the
measure
and
consider
the
fact
that
only
the
state
of
washington
can
measure
the
tax
in
the
manner
that
it
has
and
consider
also
the
fact
that
we
don't
purport
to
measure
it
by
transactions
with
which
those
activities
had
nothing
to
do,
there
can
be
no
burden
and
no
more
to
the
burden
upon
the
state.
everybody
in
washington
engaging
in
these
activities
pays
the
same
tax.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
riley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
also
take
up
one
of
the
questions
involved
in
the
first
interstate
commerce
clause
problem.
mr.
john
w.
riley
alright,
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
i
maybe
getting
in
to
the
meat
grinder
but
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
the
questions
presented
by
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
white
on
this
question
of
what
we
call
the
"preference
problem",
namely,
tax
allocation
of
taxing
jurisdiction
as
between
state
of
origin,
state
of
market.
now,
perhaps
the
best
way
to
illustrate
our
point,
your
honors,
is
to
ask
this
question
--
let's
go
to
the
facts
in
norton
and
ask
ourselves
this
question,
supposing
that
the
state
of
massachusetts,
you
remember
that
norton
was
located
in
worcester
and
orders
were
accepted
there
and
they
were
filled
there,
so
far
as
the
disputed
transactions
were
concerned.
in
other
words,
you
had,
putting
it
roughly,
an
awful
lot
of
selling
activity
going
back
--
taking
place
back
in
massachusetts.
perhaps,
so
far
as
some
transactions
are
concerned,
even
more
than
you
had
taking
place
in
illinois.
so,
the
question,
which
you,
mr.
justice
white,
asked
about
oregon,
could,
in
that
case,
have
been
asked
about
massachusetts.
should
massachusetts
have
been
allowed
in
that
case
to
have
imposed
upon
the
selling
activities
admittedly
taking
place
there
with
respect
to
the
transactions
which
are
included
in
the
tax
base
of
norton,
should
mas
--
could
massachusetts
constitutionally
or
should
it
constitutionally
be
allowed
to
impose
any
sort
of
gross
receipts
tax
on
those
selling
activities?
and
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
answer
is
no.
we
submit,
first
of
all,
that
it
should
not
be
able
to
impose
as
the
state
of
origin,
it
should
not
be
able
to
impose
a
--
gross
receipts
tax
measured
by
all
of
the
gross
receipts
nor
for
that
matter,
should
the
state
of
origin,
in
this
case
massachusetts,
to
continue
on
with
the
norton
example,
be
allowed
to
impose
even
unapportioned
gross
receipts
tax,
with
respect
to
the
transactions
included
in
the
tax
based
in
norton
because
that
would
amount
to
what
we
admit
is
a
very
bad
and
an
unconstitutional
result,
namely,
double
taxation.
that,
your
honors,
is
why
we
say
that
j.d.
adams
versus
storen,
that
gwin,
white
&
prince
versus
henneford
and
particularly
freeman
versus
hewit
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
state
of
origin,
so
far
as
gross
receipts
taxes
on
the
selling
process
is
concerned,
should
have
their
power
cutoff.
now,
admittedly,
it
--
mr.
john
w.
riley
we
say
in
view
of
field
and
in
view
of
norton
even
if
apportioned,
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
john
w.
riley
yes,
i
appreciate
that,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
w.
riley
yes.
mr.
john
w.
riley
(inaudible)
mr.
john
w.
riley
yes,
we
admit
that,
your
honor,
but
let's
also
notice
this.
mr.
john
w.
riley
this
presents
the
--
this
presents
what
we
admit
is
a
separate
question,
namely,
is
this
gamut
of
activities
which
took
place
in
washington
including
what
we
consider
to
be
the
support
activities
of
the
other
divisions,
were
these
decisive
factors
in
holding
this
mark.
mr.
john
w.
riley
yes,
we
certainly
do,
mr.
justice
white.
and
we
believe
that
considering
the
whole
picture,
considering
all
of
the
instate
activities
of
general
motors
that
are
related
to
these
sales,
we
submit,
we
have
met
that
burden
on
notice.
you
might
say
there's
a
different
of
--
difference
in
approach
between
us
and
general
motors
here.
they
would
like
to
take
each
type
of
activity
such
as
that
of
resident
personnel
and
say,
"well,
that
doesn't
do
the
job."
they
would
like
to
take
the
other
divisions
and
say,
"well,
those
don't
do
the
job."
they
would
like
the,
as
mr.
barnes
has
expressed
it
previously,
occasional
forays
of
people
from
the
portland
zone
and
say,
“well,
that
doesn't
do
the
job
either,
nothing
does
the
job,
no
taxing
jurisdiction."
our
difference
in
approach,
with
this
approach,
your
honors,
is
that
we
feel
that
you
have
to
take
all
of
these
and
look
at
the
whole
picture
and
look
at
them
together
and
if
you
want
to
take
your
rather
perhaps
mathematical
approach,
add
them
up
and
see
what
they
all
count
to.
and
we
submit,
your
honors,
that
looking
at
the
whole
picture
we
have
established
our
taxing
jurisdiction.
thank
you.
