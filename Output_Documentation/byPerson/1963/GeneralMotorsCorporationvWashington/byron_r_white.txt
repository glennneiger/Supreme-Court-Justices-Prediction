justice

now,
does
the
united
motors
service
division
office
in
the
state
of
washington
perform
services
similar
to
the
zone
office
in
connection
with
these
other
three
divisions?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
--
i
understand
but
you
have
paid
your
tax
on
those
in
--
in
the
case
of
united
motors
without
arguing.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
apparently
because
the
--
these
people
who
perform
this
service
are
gathered
together
in
an
office?
i
mean
you
have
an
office
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
they
were
name
on
the
door,
is
--
is
that
the
--
is
the
critical
--
the
critical
fact
in
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
generally,
the
--
this
is
just
a
part
of
a
general
rule
that
he
had
sufficient
activity
on
a
state
and
the
office
measures
for
this
insufficient
activity
in
the
state
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
case
of
united
motors,
do
you
have
a
whole
inventory
in
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
didn't
--
but
these
people,
the
united
motors
for
example,
i
don't
--
do
--
do
they
actually
have
salesmen
that
solicit?
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
no
solicitation.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
on
united
motors
division
where
you
have
an
office
there
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
(voice

what
you're
saying
was
the
--
was
the
bear
justice
of
--
heavily
upon
it,
the
sale
takes
place
outside,
no
solicitation
outside?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
then,
you
don't
concede
the
legality
of
the
collection
before
you
have
an
office
in
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
pay
the
tax
without
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
win
this
then
that
would
be
your
next
case,
i
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
to
make
the
wholesales
of
tables
and
lumbers
(inaudible)
the
furniture
manufacturer,
is
that
a
wholesale
sale?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
--
all
through
the
gross
receipts
measurement
thing.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
and
had
an
office
--
a
sales
office
there
and
you
would
still
have
to
layer
the
taxes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
make
any,
and
--
and
it's
very
doubtful
if
you
could
upset
that
washington
tax
when
those
circumstances
are
the
same.
i
doubt
that
if
the
payment
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
riley,
you're
--
i
take
it
that
you
say
that
whatever
the
activities
of
the
general
motors
are
in
the
state
of
washington,
they
--
they
are
equivalent
to
--
to
--
there
must
be
some
wholesale
sales
in
the
state
under
your
statute
i
guess.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
measure
of
wholesale
sales
or
the
wholesaling?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
had
actually
--
they
had
salesmen
working
out
of
the
office
in
field
enterprise.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
did
have
salesmen
soliciting
sales
in
the
--
in
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
done
in
here,
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
--
if
these
--
if
these
representatives
did
not
live
in
the
state
of
washington,
all
lived
in
oregon
and
just
went
into
washington
and
came
back,
and
i
suppose
you'd
make
the
same
argument,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
will
you
make
the
same
argument
to
all
state
over
in
portland
and
did
it
by
phone?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
many
--
how
many
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
pontiac's
are
sold
in
washington
in
the
year
it
is
supposed?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
you
are
suggesting
though
that
the
entire
gross
income
from
the
wholesale
sales
of
pontiac
must
be
attributed
to
the
state
of
washington
as
having
occurred
in
the
state
of
washington
and
subjected
to
your
tax
by
the
activities
of
three
people.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
talking
about
pontiac.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
talking
about
chevrolet
or
anybody
else,
its
pontiac.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
it's
necessary
to
the
consummation
of
the
sales
so
far
as
you
can
know
the
sales
that
have
taken
place
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
--
if
--
if
general
motors
could
show
that
these
three
--
and
none
of
these
three
--
of
these
six
people
ever
visited
or
talked
to
a
particular
pontiac
dealer
during
the
year,
you
would
not
include
those
--
those
sales
to
that
dealer,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
pontiac,
for
example,
had
no
one
in
--
in
washington
and
no
one
working
out
of
oregon
network
in
--
in
washington,
it
was
all
done
by
mail
or
by
telephone
(voice
overlap)
--
in
fact
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
if
chevrolet
had
an
office
and
the
chevrolets
were
taxable
business,
that
wouldn't
mean
pontiac
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
they
--
where
they
can
actually
contribute
to
these
sales
like
the
financing
office.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
--
first
then
you
wouldn't
be
here.
you
wouldn't
try
to
attempt
to
put
your
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
sales
take
place
in
the
state
of
oregon.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
take
place
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
takes
place
in
the
state
of
oregon?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
no,
i'm
--
i'm
not
saying
that
the
oregon
tax
would
be
on
the
privilege
of
making
wholesale
sales
in
the
state
of
oregon
just
like
you
say,
precisely
as
you
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
--
you're
saying
that
if
these
sales
that
you
have
taxed,
really
were
sales
in
the
state
of
oregon,
you're
out
of
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

of
such
measure.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
by
its
total
of
manufacturing
sales,
including
the
sales
to
washington
customers.
justice
byron
r.
white
measured
by
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
measured
by
gross
receipts
from
sales
to
washington
customers.
justice
byron

i
thought
that's
what
you
said
couldn't
be
done.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
st.
louis
can.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
if
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
we're
taxing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
we're
taxing
the
activity
--
we're
taxing
whatever
the
business
activities,
oregon
would
tax
the
--
the
business
activities
that
--
that
are
carried
on
to
state
of
oregon.
they've
got
a
zone
office
there,
they
do
all
sorts
of
things
in
oregon.
and
certainly,
you
couldn't
say,
for
example,
that
the
zone
office
contributed
not
at
all
to
the
sale
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
--
i
suggest
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suggest,
mr.
riley,
that
your
colleague
in
oregon
would
not
agree
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
our
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
--
why
is
norton
(inaudible)
--
there's
no
doubt
that
the
zone
office
there
contributed
somewhat
to
the
sales
that
took
place
in
washington
and
washington
would
attribute
the
entire
value
of
the
sales
to
the
activities
in
washington
at
the
same
--
at
the
very
same
time
you
admit
and
has
admitted
that
the
zone
office
in
detroit
--
in
portland
contributed
something
to
the
sales.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
shouldn't
the
--
why
shouldn't
the
oregon
be
able
to
--
to
do
so
also?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
might
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
might
apportion.
it
might
--
we
only
think
our
zone
office
contributes
25%
of
the
value
of
these
sales.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
norton
--
in
norton,
the
--
the
illinois
admitted
the
tax
because
the
activities
in
the
local
office
and
the
warehouse
were
deemed
to
be
of
decisive
significance
in
the
sales
that
may
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
are
decisive.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
do
you
suggest
that
the
law
is
not
that,
a
--
in
an
outside
manufacturer
is
not
taxable
were
all
he
does
in
the
--
in
the
state
is
send
the
drummer
to
the
state
that
brings
back
order
in
his
pocket?
justice
byron

white
well,
the
--
at
least
they
got
regular
customers
there.
the
drummer
goes
around
and
calls
on
everyone
up
to
twice
a

bring

--
justice
byron

white
well,
they
had
a
warehouse
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
said
that
three
--
three
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
barnes,
do
you
now
suggest
that
the
--
the
three
pontiac
representatives
in
washington,
for
example,
contribute
nothing
at
all
to
dealers,
purchasers
of
pontiac
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
--
it's
a
question
of
how
much
they
contribute.
if
they
--
if
they
became
of
decisive
significance,
as
in
norton,
the
activities
of
the
local
office
was
--
were
a
decisive
significance,
i
suppose,
then
norton
is
against
you,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
nevertheless,
there
were
--
attributed
the
illinois
where
certain
--
where
certain
sales
from
outside
the
state
in
the
illinois
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
because
the
activities
of
the
local
office
were
of
decisive
significance
in
connection
with
those
sales.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
i
would
suggest
that
if
your
--
if
there's
been
a
particular
situation
and
your
pontiac
representatives,
for
example,
were
of
decisive
significance
in
generating
purchases
that
norton
would
be
against
you,
whereas
if
they
weren't,
it
would
be
in
your
favor.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
would
--
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
your
pontiac
representatives
are
in
commerce,
in
intrastate
commerce,
they
aren't
some
--
they
are
doing
something
and
they're
doing
it
in
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
think
tax
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what
are
those
intrastate
aspects,
mr.
barnes?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
those
in
--
intrastate
aspects?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
should
not
attribute
to
itself
the
entire
benefit
of
the
credit
for
all
of
the
sales
in
the
part
of
the
activity
that
goes
into
--
occurs
outside
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
but
would
you
therefore
--
would
--
would
you
say
then
if
washington
cut
its
tax
in
half
so
that
it's
saved?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i'd
say,
cut
it
--
made
it
--
then
that's
what
exactly,
in
its
present
form,
except
it
cut
the
rate
down
at
one-tenth.
i
mean
if
the
rate
was
one-tenth
of
what
it
is
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
really,
what
we're
talking
about
is
not
--
not
whether
washington
is
trying
to
grab
it
all
but
whether
the
amount
they
take
out
of
general
motors'
side
is
--
is
somewhat
related
--
related
to
what
--
what
they
do
for
general
motors
or
something
standard
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
really
the
--
what
we're
--
you
wouldn't
really
wouldn't
care
how
they
did
it,
if
you
thought
what
they
taxed
you
was
a
reasonable
term.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
remember
that
norton
rule
--
that
the
--
that
the
activities
in
the
state
of
illinois
were
decisive
factor,
decisive
factor.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
whatever
the
activity
is
in
washington,
if
you're
going
to
rely
on
norton
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
must
sustain
if
--
if
--
as
far
as
norton
is
concerned,
you
must
sustain
the
burden
of
saying
that
the
activities
in
washington
were
decisive
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
factor.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
just
some
activities
but
decisive
act.
justice
byron

white
you
accept
that
burden
under
norton,
do
you?
