justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
you've
misunderstood
justice
black's
question.
you
gave
the
number
of
people
employed
in
washington.
he
asked
the
number
of
people
employed
in
oregon.
justice
william
o.
douglas
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
the
whole
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
washington
to
levy
sales
tax
on
the
oregon
sales.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
oregon
could.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
the
court
--
if
washington
can't
levy
a
sales
tax,
i
can
--
you
say
they
can
do
the
same
thing
with
this
way.
justice
william
o.
douglas
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
(inaudible)
--
engaged
in
the
business
of
making
sales
of
wholesale,
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
then
the
amount
of
the
tax
is
one
quarter
or
1%
of
the
gross
proceeds
of
those
sales.
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
it
--
does
any
different
from
a
sales
tax?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
if
they're
just
proceeds
of
interstate
sales,
i
was
just
wondering
what
the
actual
difference
is
and
why
the
new
york
sales
tax
is
similar.
we
held
that
that
couldn't
be
placed
upon
the
out-of-state
sales.
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
course,
inherently
the
courts
saved
your
--
your
question
by
assuming
that
it
might
be
done
for
a
proper
allocation
to
the
activities
in
the
state
but
there's
no
purported
restriction
here
along
that
line,
is
there?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
still
the
tax
is
--
is
one
quarter
or
1%
of
the
gross
proceeds
of
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
of
the
sales.
