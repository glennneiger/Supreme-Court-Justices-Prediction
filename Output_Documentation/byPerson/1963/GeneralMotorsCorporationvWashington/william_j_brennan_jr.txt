justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
do
i
understand
that
they
service
the
dealership,
is
that
it,
these
fellows?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
the
district
managers.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
he's
the
one,
and
where
is
he
located?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
i
--
if
i
get
it
though
mr.
barnes,
what
makes
it
made
you
are
minor
is
whether
you
have
an
office
located.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
you
put
a
label
on
this
tax?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
was
that
your
label,
is
that
what
the
statute
tells?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
label
do
you
give
that,
franchise,
gross
receipt?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
measured
by
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
--
and
what
constitute
instate
activity
upon
the
location
in
the
state
of
washington
of
other
general
motors
offices,
unconnected
with
these
particular
divisions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
second
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that's
the
second
question,
isn't
it?
whether
there's
any
taxes
between
the
instate
activities
and
the
wholesale.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
second
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
still
--
i'm
still
--
are
you
now
saying
that
indeed,
the
state
of
washington
does
rely
upon
the
presence
in
the
state
of
washington,
of
other
offices
which
have
some
functions
in
respect
of
the
sales
of
pontiacs
--
by
the
wholesales
of
pontiacs
and
chevrolets
whatever
the
other
thing
is.
you
are
relying
impart
on
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
my
--
why
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
you're
doing
that,
why
doesn't
norton?
on
the
first
question
on
the
instate
activities,
lying
aside
for
the
moment
the
next
is
problem.
why
doesn't
--
why
doesn't
norton?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
rule
in
your
favor
in
another
element
of
the
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
riley,
i
take
back
mr.
justice
white's
question
to
you.
missouri
may
impose
a
tax
on
manufacturer
measured
by
the
amount
of
the
wholesale.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
measured?
why
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
exactly
what
i'll
do.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
washington
--
washington
may
impose
a
tax
measured
by
the
same
proceed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
then
can't
oregon?
don't
talk
about
now
tax
on
sales.
why
cannot
oregon
by
reason
of
the
activities
in
oregon
impose
a
tax
measured
by
the
proceeds?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
didn't
suggest
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
not
taxing
the
process.
you're
taxing
the
activities,
a
tax
based
on
the
activities
in
oregon
measured
by
the
proceeds.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
all
that
washington
do.
i
don't
know
why
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
all
our
argument
(voice
overlap)
i
suggest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
tell
me,
mr.
riley,
when
--
when,
in
fact,
there
are
activities
in
sweepstakes
just
--
it
seemed
to
be
the
case
here,
what
is
your
suggestive
test
which
gives
the
power
exclusively
to
washington
and
precludes
any
tax
based
on
the
activities
in
oregon
by
oregon?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
where
--
why
the
broad
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no,
what
i'm
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
is,
to
me,
here,
we
have
activities
in
two
states
which
are
productive
ultimately
of
these
wholesales
to
watch
them
and
customers.
this
is
true,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at,
what's
the
test
that
says
that
only
washington
may
impose
a
test
measured
by
the
proceeds
based
on
washington
activities
and
denies
oregon
any
right
to
impose
the
tax
measured
by
any
part
of
those
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
--
i
thought
your
argument
was,
in
any
event,
that
oregon
could
not
impose
any
tax
based
on
activities
in
oregon
measured
by
the
washington
proceeds,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
appreciate
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
understood
you
to
say
that
by
reason
of
this,
washington
may
impose
a
tax
measured
by
100%
of
these
proceeds
and
oregon
may
--
may
impose
no
tax
measured
by
any
part
of
those
proceeds.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
want
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
if
you
had
90%
of
this
activity
in
oregon
and
10%
in
the
state
of
washington
with
the
ultimate
sales,
of
course,
the
washington
customers,
would
you
make
the
same
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
40%
of
it's
done
in
oregon
and
60%
is
done
in
washington,
you'd
say
washington.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
it
was
60%
done
in
oregon
and
40%
in
washington.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
gmac
and
the
other
two?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
long
after
they
have
paid
their
tax?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
apportioned?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
say
in
gwin,
there
wasn't
apportionment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
apportioned.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
