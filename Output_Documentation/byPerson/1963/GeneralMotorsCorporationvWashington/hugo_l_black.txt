yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
people
are
in
the
oregon
office?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice

washington
that
but
who
engaged
in
these
activities
in
washington?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
you
don't
--
you
don't
assert
that
they
would
become
liable
for
tax
simply
by
moving
that
office
that
they've
rented
or
owned,
in
portland
over
the
washington.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
why
you
wouldn't
in
the
way
be
taken
from
taxes
and
given
it
over
to
oregon.
you've
said,
paid
tax
on
that
office,
but
in
reality,
it
belongs
to
washington.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
pay
the
tax
to
oregon,
connection
with
that
office,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
did
--
you
didn't
have
a
(inaudible)
the
right
to
impose
such
a
tax,
that
tax.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
on
the
interstate
commerce,
but
on
wholesale
in
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
none
of
by
figure
and
sounds
in
there
but
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
mean
that
about
this
tax,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
tax
works
on
the
little
fellow
did
in
general
motors?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
involve
this
tax?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
was
an
office.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
riley,
i
--
i
gather
you
--
no
part
of
the
states
provide
upon
a
set
of
power
to
levy
this
type
of
dependance
upon
the
fact
that
there
are,
although
for
other
division
of
general
motors,
actual
opposites
of
general
motors
in
the
state
of
washington.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
made
--
that
made
an
indication
over
the
amount
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
it's
out
of
proportion
to
the
--
to
the
--
whether
the
state
had
a
right
to
tax
to
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
has
been
--
did
the
court
find
how
much,
regardless
of
the
name
and
regardless
of
the
method
of
taxing,
what
was
found
with
reference
to
that
being
a
fair
tax
along
with
all
the
other
taxes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
think
it
does
--
some
of
our
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
some
of
our
cases
have
said
that
so
long
as
the
--
although
this
has
been
a
deviation
of
some
minor
respects,
so
long
as
the
entire
tax
imposed
on
the
company
doing
business
in
the
states
is
not
out
of
proportion
to
what
is
a
fair
and
just
approximation
points
activities
of
the
state,
not
to
be
subside
because
of
the
label
quite
a
bit
fair
or
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
given
thoughts
of
the
imposition
of
the
tax
with
some
respect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
litigation
has
no
--
i
--
i
found
no
direct
challenge
to
the
amount
of
the
tax
in
connection
with
all
of
--
and
other
taxes
imposed
against
general
motors
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
connection
with
the
right
of
washington
to
impose
a
tax
on
the
company
or
to
its
activities.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that's
a
question
of
fact,
is
it
not,
that
--
whether
it's
related
to
inter
--
intrastate
activities
or
interstate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
must
fight
the
difference
that
i
think,
i'm
not
sure,
maybe
possible
and
you
can
argue
that
the
tax
imposed
by
a
certain
purpose
is
too
much
for
that
particular
purpose.
but
there's
also
a
question
and
had
been
treated
in
some
cases,
whether
you
take
that
tax,
add
to
it
all
the
other
taxes
of
general
motors
or
a
company
as
a
whole.
it
is
more
than
the
state's
entitled
to
impose
for
all
the
activities
the
company
engages
within
a
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
court
(inaudible)
imposition
of
tax
on
an
activity
and
the
right
to
--
how
much
you
can
get?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
measuring
it
by
some
--
some
standard
that
you
look
behind
the
standard
to
see
whether
or
not
there's
more
tax
than
you
have
it
by
their
president.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
american
manufacturing
company
against
st.
louis
has
been
the
rule
ever
since,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
except
for
the
possibly
slight
deviation
in
spector
that
you
don't
look
to
see
that
the
object
just
to
see
whether
the
amount
of
the
tax,
however
it
is
measured,
is
unconstitutional.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
measuring
your
tax
by
the
amount
of
the
sales.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
is
to
say
that
what
you
were
arguing
here
is
that
supposed,
the
tax
as
measured
that
way
is
$1000,
instead
of
that,
you
have
said
$1000,
you
were
saying
that
its
constitutionality
is
determined,
you
are
--
you
determined
its
constitutionality
by
the
amount
of
tax
sales,
not
by
the
particular
means
to
take
to
measure
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
about
the
burden
on
--
on
--
the
burden
on
interstate
commerce?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
suppose
if
that
is
the
question
at
all,
the
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
which
is
the
theory
of
the
commerce
clause,
are
you
to
determine
that
burden
by
the
type
of
--
of
formula
used
to
collect
the
tax
or
by
the
amount
of
the
tax
in
effect
to
the
collector?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
was
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
was
saying.
