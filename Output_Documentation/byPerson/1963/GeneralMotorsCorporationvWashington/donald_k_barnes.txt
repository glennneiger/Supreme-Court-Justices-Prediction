mr.
donald
k.
barnes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
challenges
the
constitutionality
of
unapportioned
gross
receipts
tax
assessment
made
by
the
state
of
washington
against
general
motors
corporation
with
respect
to
exclusively
interstate
commerce,
and
it
challenges
that
assessment
on
two
grounds,
interstate
commerce
and
due
process
and
two
points
under
each.
rather
startling
new
law
would
be
created
by
affirmance
of
this
decision,
the
statute
under
which
the
assessments
were
made
have
been
in
effect
for
20
years
and
have
been
as
it's
going
on
for
longer
than
that
before
this
issue
was
raised
and
there's
no
precedent
for
it
anywhere.
reversal
however,
requires
only
the
application
of
familiar
principles
denied
particularly
extraordinary
facts.
well,
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
in
state
tax
matters
indicate
that
there
are
two
things
that
need
to
be
kept
in
mind
carefully,
now
i
want
to
mention
those
before
i
go
into
the
details
of
the
facts.
the
first
is
the
nature
of
the
tax
that
makes
a
lot
of
difference
as
we
look
at
each
precedent
and
each
set
of
facts,
and
second,
as
to
the
facts
not
only
what
was
done
but
where
it
was
done.
this
tax
is
one
which
is
imposed
specifically
by
the
statute
and
directed
to
be
a
burden
upon
the
vendor
for
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
the
business
of
making
sales
at
wholesale
and
measured
by
unapportioned
gross
receipts
derived
or
related
to
those
sales.
now,
the
circumstances
to
which
a
tax
of
that
nature
can
constitutionally
be
applied
are
considerably
narrower
than
the
circumstances
which
will
support
any
apportioned
tax
including,
best
example,
and
that
income
tax
even
though
that's
paid
by
the
vendor
also,
or
a
consumption
tax,
the
sales
or
use
tax
which
is
paid
by
the
vendee.
now,
the
facts
here
are
that,
although
constitutionally
from
constitutional
point
of
view
very
simple,
they're
quite
detailed.
general
motors
corporation
is
a
delaware
corporation
that's
qualified
to
do
business
in
washington.
its
business
is
manufacturing
primarily
automobiles
and
parts
and
accessories
therefore
and
some
of
the
--
those
products
are
involved
in
this
suit.
there
are
many
other
products
which
are
not
involved
here.
the
selling
which
the
corporation
does
is
incidental
to
and
a
part
of
its
manufacturing
activity.
we
are
not,
in
other
words,
a
merchant.
the
corporation
is
organized
into
divisions
and
conducts
its
business
through
divisions
which
is
still
not
separately
incorporated
are
substantially
independent
of
each
other
and
in
fact
to
a
considerable
degree
in
competition
with
each
other.
this
appeal
involves
transactions
of
only
at
chevrolet,
oldsmobile,
pontiac,
and
general
motors
parts
divisions.
the
first
three
manufacturing
automobiles
by
that
name,
chevrolet
also
trucks
and
general
motors
parts
supplying
parts
and
accessories
for
service
requirements
of
dealers
in
the
aftermarket.
you
will
recognize
that
chevrolet
and
pontiac
for
example
are
in
competition
with
each
other.
now,
in
the
state
of
washington,
there
are
no
manufacturing
facilities
for
any
part
of
the
corporation.
there
are,
however,
offices
of
some
of
the
other
divisions
which
are
not
involved
in
this
suit.
they
either
are
concerned
with
other
products
or
they're
concerned
with
entirely
different
activities
such
as
financing.
the
tax
on
all
of
the
transactions
that
are
related
in
any
way
to
those
offices,
has
been
paid
without
dispute
and
is
not
here
involved
in
any
way.
there
is
in
the
state,
no
office
of
any
kind
having
any
relation
to
any
of
the
tax
receipts
in
the
first
of
two
classes
of
transactions.
in
the
second
class,
there
is
a
small
branch
which
will
be
mentioned
in
a
minute.
now,
the
transactions
which
are
here
in
--
in
dispute,
all
concerned
products
which
are
manufactured
entirely
outside
of
the
state,
sold
entirely
outside
of
the
state,
delivered
outside
of
the
state
to
common
carriers,
paid
for
outside
of
the
state,
and
shipped
into
the
state.
they're
all
sales
at
wholesale
to
independent
dealers.
now,
the
sales
organization,
since
we
are
talking
about
a
tax
on
the
business
of
selling
is
of
immediate
concern,
and
it's
the
same
for
each
of
these
three
principal
divisions,
although
each
is
independent
of
the
other,
each
has
a
national
headquarters
in
michigan.
each
has
a
--
a
regional
west
coast
office
in
california.
each
has
its
lowest
organizational
office
in
portland,
oregon.
now,
that
zone
office
in
each
case
covers
a
territory
of
all
of
state
of
washington,
all
of
oregon,
all
of
alaska,
and
variously
parts
of
idaho,
montana
and
wyoming.
the
personnel
at
pontiac
office,
and
similarly
in
the
olds
office
run
from
20
to
22
people
and
that
gets
up
to
40
in
the
case
of
chevrolet
as
it's
quite
apparent,
that's
very
thin
coverage
for
so
large
a
territory
as
we've
just
described.
those
people
worked
in
most
--
most
of
them
in
and
some
in
and
out
of
the
offices
in
portland,
but
there
are
two
classes
of
employees
belonging
to
those
offices,
who
are
assigned
specific
territories
within
the
zone
and
reside
in
those
territories.
those
are
the
service
representatives
and
the
so-called
district
managers.
now,
combining
those
two
groups,
the
maximum
in
washington
at
any
one
time
that
is
stationed
in
washington,
was
the
pontiac
division
3,
oldsmobile
6,
and
chevrolet
17.
the
zone
manager
responsible
for
having
the
right
dealers
in
the
right
place
to
this
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
they
may,
mr.
justice
white.
they
are
assigned
to
territories
which
are
at
least
flatly
in
washington.one
of
them
may
have
lived
in
--
in
oregon,
worked
in
washington.
i
think
we're
not
sure.
i'll
assume
they
lived
in
washington,
some
of
them
do.
there's
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
i
didn't
hear
you
sir.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
yes,
mr.
justice
clark,
the
three
pontiac
men
worked
only
for
pontiac,
the
oldsmobile
were
only
for
oldsmobile,
and
so
forth,
and
as
i
said,
in
competition
with
each
other.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
they
call
on
the
dealerships
of
service
representatives,
advised
the
dealers
with
respect
to
service
problems,
that
is
how
to
maintain
the
automobiles
and
the
district
managers
advised
them
about
everything
else,
how
many
salesmen
they
have
and
--
and
how
to
project
the
estimates
of
how
many
cars
they'll
need.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
district
manager
is
the
one
who
does
this.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
he
is
assigned
a
territory
with
30
or
40
dealers.
he
lives
within
that
territory.
and
as
i
say
in
the
case
of
pontiac,
there
were
three
of
them
who
were
--
two
i
believe,
lived
in
washington,
one
lived
in
oregon,
but
worked
also
in
washington.
his
office
is
the
office
of
the
zone
in
portland,
oregon
to
which
he
reports
and
visits
occasionally.
the
zone
manager
is
the
man
in-charge
of
the
whole
office
in
the
whole
area.
the
district
manager
is
the
law
man.
he
isn't
in-charge
of
anybody.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
yes,
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
why
we've
mentioned
these
three
only?
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
because
the
assessments
were
made
against
them
and
not
against
the
others.
it
was
a
matter
of
the
state's
audit
procedure.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
four
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
--
the
general
--
three
car
divisions
plus
the
general
motors
parts
division.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
but
similar
assessments
could
have
been
made
against
other
divisions
that
would
operate
in
the
same
way.
there
are
still
others
as
i
said
before
which
operate
through
offices
in
the
state
and
they
pay
taxes
on
their
operations.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
one
example
which
is
mentioned
in
the
state's
brief
is
united
motors
service
division.
united
motors
service
division
is
a
distributor
of
accessories
and
some
parts.
a
good
example
is
--
is
batteries.
when
dealers
and
gas
stations
require
batteries
for
replacement,
they
buy
them
from
distributors
of
united
motors
service
division.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
generally
similar,
mr.
justice
white
but
it
has
to
do
with
the
products
which
they
are
handling
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
not
those
of
the
car
divisions.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
we
have
an
office,
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
it
is.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
if
we
have
an
office
in
the
state,
any
transaction
passing
through
that
office
is
considered
part
of
the
base
for
this
type
of
tax.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
i
don't
know
whether
that
allows
in
the
state
or
not.
i
suspect
they
do
not.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
their
functions
--
their
functions
are
about
the
same
as
those
of
the
district
managers
for
the
car
division.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
generally
no
solicitation.
it's
promotion.
the
zone
manager
is
responsible
for
having
the
right
dealers
in
the
right
place,
his
staff
including
these
district
managers,
give
him
some
assistance.
he
gets
a
lot
more
from
headquarters
offices
in
michigan
as
to
where
dealership
should
be
placed
to
meet
the
market
effectively.
and
then
he
makes
recommendations
to
the
region
and
headquarters
offices
where
the
selections
are
approved,
then
he
executes
a
dealer
selling
agreement
which
is
a
rather
formal
document,
he
executes
that
at
his
office
in
portland.
it
defines
the
relationship
which
will
exist
from
then
on
between
the
manufacturer
and
the
dealer.
and
the
dealer
is
an
--
an
independent
customer
of
the
corporation,
not
its
agent
nor
its
emissary
in
any
way.
the
dealer
provides
his
own
premises,
his
own
inventory,
his
own
tools,
his
own
personnel.
his
new
car
inventory
is
usually
financed
and
sometimes
that's
done
by
general
motors
acceptance
corporation,
which
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
the
general
motors
corporation.
and
of
course,
if
the
tax
is
due
and
that
finance
business
are
paid
at
general
motors
acceptance
corporation.
in
a
few
cases,
part
of
the
fixed
capital
which
is
a
very
heavy
requirement
for
a
new
dealership
is
supplied
temporarily
by
motors
holding
division,
which
is
another
and
separate
division
of
general
motors
corporation.
it
again,
pays
the
taxes
on
its
own
transactions.
now,
the
dealers'
business
is
retailing
new
cars,
parts
and
accessories
which
he
buys
from
general
motors
corporation
and
other
related
products
which
he
buys
from
others
such
as
tires,
used
cars,
fuel,
and
so
forth.
and
sometimes,
the
dealers
carry
competing
lines
of
automobiles,
i
mean
not
competing
lines
of
our
own
but
a
competing
lines
of
other
unrelated
manufacturers.
a
dealer
sells
where
he
pleases
and
sets
his
own
resale
prices.
but
under
the
contract,
he
has
a
duty
to
develop
the
market
for
his
particular
line
of
car
in
that
vicinity.
and
to
that
end,
he's
required
to
have
adequate
premises,
personnel,
stock,
capital,
tools
and
signs,
uniform
accounting,
so
that
his
results
can
be
compared
or
at
least
uniform
financial
statements.
the
result
of
accounting
which
can
be
compared
with
other
dealerships
to
detect
financial
weaknesses
and
so
forth
and
he
must
submit
a
number
of
reports,
the
most
important
to
which
are
for
the
purpose
of
assisting
the
corporations'
production
planning
because
automobiles
as
you
know
are
sold
to
make,
that
is
the
are
made-to-order
chevrolet
alone
could
make
2
--
2,000,000
different
kinds
of
automobiles
under
all
the
options
which
are
available.
after
the
agreement
has
been
entered
into,
the
function
of
the
zone
office
and
all
its
personnel
is
to
assist
the
dealer
in
any
way
he
can
to
make
his
operation
profitable
and
to
check
his
performance
of
the
agreement
and
see
that
he
lives
up
to
it.
financial
matters
are
approached
through
these
financial
statements.
the
--
there's
advice
given
also
on
proper
development
and
utilization
of
sales
personnel
and
sales
methods,
similarly
on
service
procedures
and
the
handling
of
service
complaints.
most
of
the
principles
which
go
into
this
advice
and
the
details
of
it
for
that
matter
are
developed
by
staffs
in
the
zone,
region
and
headquarters
offices
but
are
then
delivered
by
the
district
managers
or
service
representatives
through
their
regular
visits
to
the
dealers
which
they
make,
or
as
often
as
once
a
week.
in
the
case
of
larger
dealers,
sometimes
less
for
the
smaller
ones
and
there
also,
they
pick
up
the
dealers'
complaints
and
questions
and
carry
them
into
the
other
offices
for
technical
assistance
and
handle
what
they
can
on
their
own.
there
are
--
these
business
provided
the
--
these
two
people
are
supplemented
by
irregular
visits
by
the
zone
manager
himself,
by
the
department
heads
in
his
office,
and
by
personnel
from
other
offices
and
experts
that
are
brought
in
for
special
cases.
now,
the
reports
that
the
dealer
is
required
to
submit
begin
with
a
ten-day
report,
and
on
that,
every
ten
days,
he
reports
to
the
zone
office
the
unit
sales,
that
is
the
number
of
automobiles
he
has
sold
during
the
past
10
days.
the
inventory
has
left
at
the
end
of
the
ten
days.
this
is
used
for
the
development
of
this
projection
--
economic
projecting
trends
which
you
--
if
you
watch
the
new
--
automobile
reports
of
all
the
newspapers
will
show
you
every
ten
days,
they're
boasting
about
how
good
business
is
because
of
what
happened
during
the
last
ten
days
by
putting
all
these
reports
countrywide
together.
financial
statements,
i
mentioned
before,
is
submitted
monthly.
and
the
interesting
one
which
is
insisted
upon
by
chevrolet
and
it's
usual
in
the
case
of
pontiac,
is
a
90-day
projection.
the
district
manager
and
the
dealer
sit
down
together
in
the
dealers'
place
of
business
and
make
up
this
projection.
and
that
estimates
the
number
of
cars
which
the
dealer
will
need
to
order
for
each
month
for
the
next
three
months,
as
revised
each
month.
the
purpose
of
course,
is
production
planning
for
the
reason
already
mentioned.
now,
the
zone
office
consolidates
these
reports
from
all
the
dealers
on
its
zone
and
passes
on
to
the
factory
the
consolidation,
not
the
individual
reports.
oldsmobile
doesn't
--
has
this
procedure
on
its
books
but
at
least
the
zone
office
in
portland
has
said
that
they
find
little
occasion
to
use
if
they
may,
the
estimates
by
their
own
personnel
in
their
own
office.
at
least
that
they
are
not
orders
as
you
see.
now,
the
sales
procedure
starts
with
an
order,
it's
really
a
purchase
procedure
by
the
dealer
which
is
sent
by
the
dealer
of
the
zone
office
in
almost
all
cases
by
mail,
though
occasionally,
he
may
telephone
in
an
urgent
one,
and
occasionally,
the
district
manager
happens
to
be
there.
he'll
hand
it
to
him.
now,
the
district
manager
carried
it
into
the
zone
office.
the
zone
office
records
these
things
and
then
forwards
them
to
proper
factory,
and
they
have
to
make
a
choice
there
because
not
all
models
are
made
at
all
factories.
some
may
be
made
in
california,
most
of
them
are.
a
few
come
only
from
missouri,
and
some
have
to
be
shipped
from
michigan.
the
proper
factory
to
which
the
order
is
sent,
accepts
or
rejects
the
order
and
acceptance
or
rejection
is
no
formality
in
this
situation,
again,
because
of
the
wide
variety
of
the
product.
there
are
many
times
that
the
factory
cannot
make
the
particular
order
that
has
--
particular
car
that
has
been
ordered.
it
must
reject
the
order
and
request
the
dealer
to
submit
something
else.
the
factory
notifies
the
dealer,
it
then
schedules
the
car
for
production
which
takes
a
matter
of
two
to
three
weeks.
if
everything
is
on
time,
it
receives
payment
when
time
comes
for
delivery.
and
then
having
received
payment,
it
makes
delivery
to
a
common
carrier
that
will
be
the
factory
passing
the
title
at
that
point
and
consigned
to
the
dealer
in
this
case
in
washington.
now
as
you
see
from
this
description,
there
is
ordinarily
no
solicitation
of
orders,
although
i
think
that
point
is
a
matter
of
complete
immateriality.
the
retail
demand
for
automobiles
is
created
wisely
by
the
dealer
activity.
he
does
a
lot
of
soliciting,
and
supplemented
by
the
national
advertising
which
is
placed
at
entirely
with
--
at
michigan
and
then
of
course
distributed
by
the
media
not
by
us
to
all
over
the
country.
the
dealer
will
buy
all
of
the
cars
that
he
can
sell,
so
it
becomes
unnecessary
to
solicit
from
him.
if
we
can
get
him
to
make
the
sales
to
the
retail
customers,
the
wholesale
business
follows.
the
corporation
personnel
do
not
contact
the
dealer's
customers
except
to
referee
an
occasional
service
complaint.
the
trial
court
divided
the
transactions
into
two
classes.
and
the
first
class,
it
put
all
sales
by
oldsmobile,
all
sales
by
pontiac,
all
sales
by
general
motors
parts
division,
and
chevrolet
sales
to
dealers
in
the
nine
southern
counties
of
washington.
now,
as
to
these
transactions,
no
washington
office
of
any
kind
had
any
contact,
whatsoever.
and
in
the
case
of
general
motors
parts
division,
although
with
there's
--
no
point
was
made
on
this
in
the
trial
court,
it
appears
on
evidence,
the
court
--
i
mean
the
division
has
no
field
personnel
at
all.
all
its
men
stay
right
on
the
warehouse
and
simply
receive
a
field
orders
at
that
point.
a
second
class
--
no,
the
trial
court
held
the
assessment
in
--
unconstitutional
as
to
all
these
first
class
of
transactions
and
was
reversed
by
the
washington
supreme
court.
the
second
class
of
transactions
involves
only
sales
by
chevrolet
division
to
dealers
located
in
counties
other
than
the
nine
southern
counties
of
washington.
and
the
sole
difference
between
those
transactions
and
the
others
is
that
as
to
those
dealers,
to
whom
those
sales
were
made,
there
was
within
the
state
a
one-man
branch
office,
this
one
man
had
a
secretary.
he
had
a
territory
which
included
all
of
that
part
of
washington
which
i've
mentioned
plus
all
of
alaska
and
part
of
idaho.
he
had
no
contact
with
any
other
personnel
and
no
part
in
the
activity
which
i
previously
described.
his
procedure
was
--
his
function
was
to
hold
hands
as
he
said,
“the
dealers
in
that
territory,”
and
primarily
to
expedite
deliveries
of
this
car
shipped
from
california
and
so
forth
during
a
period
of
short
supply.
both
lower
courts
held
the
assessments
constitutional
as
to
the
sales
to
those
dealers.
now,
the
activities
in
and
out
of
washington,
wholly
out
of
washington
are
the
engineering
designed
procurement,
manufacture
of
the
automobiles,
the
financial
management,
general
management,
the
placement
of
the
advertisement,
the
sales
procedures,
so
far
as
general
motors
is
concerned,
that
is
the
receipt
and
acceptance
of
the
orders,
the
delivery
of
the
product
and
receive
the
payment.
now,
partly
out
of
the
state
and
partly
within
it
is
this
function
of
selecting
and
appointing
dealers
in
the
first
place,
the
rendering
of
advice
and
assistant
to
the
dealers
and
checking
on
the
dealer
performance,
most
of
which
as
we
said
was
done
at
the
leg-work
level
by
the
resident
district
manager
and
is
assisted
sometimes
by
the
service
manager.
that's
a
long
recitation
of
facts
but
there
is
much
detail
and
yet
very
little
in
substance
that
can't
be
said
very
briefly
to
recapitulate
that.
automobiles,
parts
and
accessories
are
manufactured,
sold
and
delivered
entirely
out-of
the
state
and
shipped
to
customers
within
the
state.
no
new
--
there
is
no
related
intrastate
commerce
of
any
kind
and
there
is
no
local
office
of
any
kind.
the
local
activity
by
traveling
representatives
in
furtherance
is
in
furtherance
of
out-of-state
sales
and
that
is
the
only
instate
activity.
the
exceptions,
of
course,
are
the
one-man
office
previously
mentioned
relating
to
deliveries
of
the
second
class,
and
there
is
no
field
personnel
at
all
for
general
motors
parts
division
and
like
characterizations
hereafter
will
be
subject
to
those
two
exceptions
to
avoid
repetition.
now,
the
formulation
and
application
of
constitutional
rules
in
this
area
depends
upon
the
incidence
and
to
some
extent
upon
the
incidence
and
impact
of
tax.
it
is
said
that
the
purpose
of
taxes
is
to
pay
for
benefits
to
the
taxpayer
or
at
least
to
a
class
on
which
the
taxpayer
is
a
member
and
that
they
should,
therefore,
bear
some
physical
relation
to
the
benefits
and
protection
which
are
conferred
by
the
governor.
and
the
basis
of
tax
was
distinguished
from
its
purpose
is
a
privilege
or
a
property
or
an
activity,
or
something
which
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
taxing
authority,
and
the
tax,
therefore,
should
bear
some
relationship
to
that
privilege
or
property
or
activity.
now,
the
washington
court,
in
approaching
this
problem,
we
are
sure
was
mistaken
in
its
application
of
economic
principles
and
that
is
why
it
strained
to
avoid
the
constitutional
rules
which
have
been
established
by
this
court.
it
fell
for
this
market
state
concept,
that
is,
“market
provides
the
income
and
the
state
is
therefore
entitled
to
some
payment
for
protecting
the
market,”
and
or
it
goes
on
with
the
--
the
vendor
is
taking
money
out
of
the
state
when
he
sells
products
into
it.
now,
that
type
of
argument
is
unsound
on
all
accounts.
and
as
this
court
has
frequently
observed,
income
is
produced
not
by
the
market
but
by
capital
or
labor
and
both
combined
and
therefore
is
produced
where
the
capital
and
labor
or
both
combined
or
expended
and
not
where
the
customer
happens
to
be.
the
state's
protection
to
the
market
is
protection
to
the
customers,
not
to
the
vendor
or
only
very
incidentally,
to
the
vendor.
all
states
of
course
are
equally
producer
in
markets
so
that
this
argument
about
taking
money
out
of
the
market
is
completely
fallacious.
the
value
which
is
put
on
the
state
equals
value
taken
out.
it's
no
more
reasonable
to
say
that
general
motors
takes
money
out
of
washington
than
to
say
that
washington
takes
automobiles
away
from
general
motors.
both
statements
are
equally
absurd.
now,
the
court
inadvertently
perhaps
explains
its
action,
its
opinion
by
relying
to
uphold
the
tax
upon
the
presence
of
the
customer
and
upon
the
fact
that
he
reads
the
newspapers,
"beam
in
national
advertisement,"
the
court
said.
now,
it's
perfectly
reasonable
as
mr.
justice
rutledge
has
had
occasioned
to
point
out
that
a
tax
which
is
paid
by
the
customer,
that
is
a
consumer
tax,
like
a
use
tax,
should
be
paid
to
the
consumer's
state
because
it's
the
consumer
who's
getting
the
benefits
or
the
protection
of
that
state.
it's
the
consumer
who
can
--
if
he
doesn't
like
it,
control
it
with
his
fellow
voters
through
the
elective
franchise
and
it's
there
that
competition
is
concerned.
and
we
have
used
taxes
and
sales
taxes
both
paid
by
the
consumer
balancing
in
the
state
of
the
consumer
so
that
the
--
the
out-of-state
vendor
has
no
advantage
over
the
instate
vendor.
that
is
fine
for
consumer
taxes.
but
this
tax,
like
other
taxes
on
the
vendor,
should
be
paid
to
the
vendor's
state,
and
that
is
where
the
vendor
operates,
these
taxes
on
the
vendor.
and
the
statute
specifically
forbids
it's
being
passed
on
as
such
to
customers
within
the
state.
it
is
passed
on
instead
as
part
of
the
cost,
just
like
any
other
cost
that
goes
into
the
computation
of
general
prices.
the
result
is,
it's
paid
by
customers
in
michigan.
it
has
no
effect
on
local
competition.
the
contrast
to
this,
well
the
property
tax
which
my
friend
mentioned
in
the
state's
brief,
of
course,
these
automobiles
to
the
extent,
they're
manufactured
in
michigan,
come
out
of
factories
in
michigan.
property
taxes
are
paid
on
those
factories
to
michigan
localities
and
those
taxes
are
included
in
the
cost
which
the
washington
customer
pays
when
he
buys
his
car,
but
that's
as
it
should
be
because
the
factories
in
--
on
which
the
taxes
are
paid
are
contributing
to
the
washington
customer's
car
and
so
are
the
services
provided
by
the
state
of
michigan
in
support
to
those
factories.
that's
entirely
different
from
a
tax
which
is
related
merely
to
the
fact
that
there's
a
customer
in
washington
which
is
required
to
be
passed
onto
a
customer
in
michigan.
the
constitutional
rules
involved
here
are
four.
first,
states
may
not
tax
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
interstate
commerce.
second,
states
may
not
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce
nor
expose
it
to
multiple
burdens.
third,
states
may
not
tax
subjects
not
within
their
territory,
and
fourth,
states
may
not
impose
taxes
bearing
no
reasonable
relation
--
relation
to
services
and
protection
afforded
by
the
state.
now,
this
tax
as
applied
through
these
assessments
is
on
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
exclusively
interstate
commerce.
the
supreme
court
of
washington
said,
“though
the
tax
is
on
local
activities,
these
district
managers
running
around
in
the
state.”
but
such
activities
were
solely
in
furtherance
of
sales
which
themselves
were
made
as
that
supreme
court
recognized
entirely
outside
of
the
state.
they
were
not
any
part
of
nor
were
they
in
any
way
related
to
in
the
intrastate
business
and
they
were
not
related
to
any
local
office
as
the
trial
court
found.
now,
the
statute
says
that
the
tax
is
on
the
act
or
privilege
of
engaging
in
the
business
of
making
wholesale
sales,
engaging
within
the
state,
the
business
of
making
wholesale
sales.
because
it's
where
they
use
the
statutory
version
or
the
judicial
version,
it
seems
to
me
to
make
no
difference.
a
tax
which
is
on
an
act,
which
is
necessarily
and
exclusively
a
part
of
interstate
commerce
is
a
tax
on
interstate
commerce
and
if
its
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that,
you
see
--
as
of
very
keen
observations
of
it.
it
would
--
it
would
indeed.
all
i
can
say
to
that
and
that
one
time
i
thought
of
weaving
it
into
argument,
saying
it
before
i
was
asked,
is
that
our
policy
is
that
we
have
an
office
in
the
state
we
pay
the
tax
on
every
transaction
that
passes
through
that.
now,
i
mean
not
merely
the
state
but
also
this
does
happen
in
--
although,
it's
a
very
rare
tax
of
washington
and
i
believe
in
west
virginia,
only
two
have
it
and
west
virginia
doesn't
apply
it
this
way.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
if
--
if
that
--
that
operation
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that's
--
that's
right.
that
operation
is
vulnerable
to
attack
on
the
ground
that
the
state
may
not
impose
a
tax
on
interstate
commerce
and
that
it
didn't
held
a
number
of
times
by
this
court.
our
case
is
almost
identical
with
alpha
portland
cement
which
first
said
that
and
sweeney
brothers
back
in
the
1920s
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that
does
not
follow.
i
--
i
hope
that
we
won't
have
this
type
of
tax
around
much
longer.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
to
the
state
of
washington?
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
since
they
enacted,
i
think
that
was
1935,
but
we're
not
--
the
tax
is
not
a
burden-some
tax
when
it
is
related
to
a
major
activity
within
the
state.
and
i
say
--
i
--
it
does
occur
in
other
jurisdictions
that
exist
--
that
says
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that
is
the
principle
distinction,
but
we
come
to
other
differences
too.
there,
as
i
pointed
out,
there
are
three
or
four
reasons
altogether
in
which
four
ways
in
which
these
--
the
assessments
violate
the
constitutional
rules
established
by
this
court.
only
the
first
one
is
subject
to
the
confusion
which
mr.
justice
white
has
pointed
out.
that
is
--
that
would
apply
also
to
our
offices
there
and
i
should
have
that
since
the
end
to
the
order
period
here
involved,
chevrolet
division
has
split
its
portland
zone
office
and
has
a
zone
office
in
seattle
and
it
pays
the
tax
without
question
on
the
transactions
going
through
that
office.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
we
know
that
none
other
than
their
zone
office
in
portland
as
they
simply
work
from
their
homes,
calling
on
the
dealers
and
of
course
they
may
get
telephone
calls
and
mail
at
their
homes
but
their
only
office
is
the
zone
office
in
portland.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
business
--
the
business
is
run
without
any
regard
to
taxes
and
tax
problems
are
my
problem
after
the
business
had
been
done.
the
--
the
zone
office
operates
that
way
because
there's
no
reason
for
this
individual
to
have
an
--
an
office.
his
job
is
to
work
out
of
the
zone
office
and
go
call
on
people
and
the
only
reason
that
we
don't
say
that
his
--
that
he
is
in
the
zone
office
is
because
the
territory
is
so
large.
if
he
is
in
northern
washington
for
example,
they
don't
want
him
to
come
back
into
portland
every
afternoon,
so
he
just
comes
in
once
every
week
or
two
or
when
he
has
a
vacation
to
report.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
in
their
customer
complaints?
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
the
--
the
service
representative
would
do
that,
that
he
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
no.
no,
he
reports
to
a
head
--
to
a
--
to
his
department
head
in
the
same
zone
office
but
it's
a
separate
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
in
portland,
i'm
sorry.
the
customer
complaint
is
not
a
big
part
of
the
business.
usually,
the
dealers
can
handle
their
own
complaints
but
occasionally,
we
get
a
customer
who
writes
to
mr.
frederick
downer
in
new
york
and
complains
about
his
chevrolet,
doesn't
run
right
then,
it
goes
back.
in
that
case,
the
service
representative
would
take
it
to
deal
and
say,
“what
did
you
do
for
this
fellow
and
what's
the
matter
with
his
car?”
it's
not
a
frequent
occurrence
but
it
does
happen.
i
mentioned
it
because
it's
the
only
contact
that
any
of
our
representatives
have
with
the
ultimate
customer,
that
is
with
the
retail
--
the
dealer's
retail
customer.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
in
the
oregon
office
--
in
the
case
of
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
in
the
case
of
pontiac
division,
there
were
three
who
resided
in
washington
and
the
case
of
oldsmobile
6
and
the
case
of
chevrolet
17,
and
then
there
were
sporadic
visits
by
other
personnel
from
other
offices,
but
those
were
the
maximum
numbers
which
anytime
resided
within
the
state.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
i
did
say
exactly
that
unless
we're
sure
they
would
be
liable
for
it
but
i'm
sure
we
would
pay
it
because
we
in
fact
did
that.
when
we
split
the
portland
chevrolet
office
and
put
half
of
it
in
seattle,
we
have
since
that
time
paid
tax
on
every
transaction
going
through
the
seattle
office.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
well,
i'm
sorry,
sir.
the
pontiac
and
oldsmobile
offices
each
have
from
20
to
22
total
personnel
including
the
ones
which
are
in
washington,
the
numbers
i
just
gave
you,
the
balance
are
in
oregon.
chevrolet
has
about
40
home
--
somewhere
between
25
and
30
are
in
oregon,
permanently
located
in
oregon.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
yes,
your
honor.
not
this
type
of
tax.
oregon
doesn't
have
this
type
of
tax.
we
do
pay
some
kind
of
a
franchise
tax.
i
know
as
you're
sure
what
it
is
except
there's
an
apportioned
tax
to
the
state
of
oregon.
we
also
pay
one
to
the
state
of
california
and
one
to
state
of
michigan
and
one
to
missouri
--
part
of
this.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that
is
from
the
due
process
questions,
the
amount
of
the
tax
is
enormous
in
relation
to
the
activity
which
is
carried
on
within
the
state
of
washington.
and
that's
one
of
our
--
that's
our
fourth
point
that
the
tax
is
invalid
because
the
assessment
--
there
is
no
reasonable
relation
to
its
subject.
that
is
activity
within
the
state.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
unapportioned
gross
receipts,
normally
not.
it's
a
tax
for
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
the
business
of
making
wholesale
sales,
within
the
state,
measured
by
unapportioned
gross
receipts.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that
is
almost
an
exact
quotation
of
the
statute.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
i
call
it
franchise
tax,
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
unapportioned
gross
receipts.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
on
interstate
commerce,
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
no.
if
the
wholesale
sale
was
made
within
the
state,
then
the
tax
is
not
constitutionally
infirmed
on
any
ground
has
yet
been
raised
because
this
is
a
fundamentally
unsound
kind
of
tax
because
it
even
locally,
without
regard
to
interstate
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
well,
this
one's
a
champion
in
that
respect
because
it
pyramids
and
it
discriminates
as
augments
--
as
against
the,
let's
say
a
succession
of
little
businesses
coming
up
with
the
same
final
product
and
in
favor
of
a
--
a
large
and
integrated
business
doing
the
same
thing,
and
the
illustration
we
have
on
our
brief
is
one
of
those
things.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
this
tax,
yes.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
it's
worst
on
the
little
fellow
than
on
someone
else
in
the
same
business
and
integrated.
it
would
be
if
you
could
conceive
of
it.
the
example
i
gave
was
a
--
an
integrated
furniture
manufacturer
who
did
everything
that
was
needed
to
make
a
table
and
sell
at
retail
from
cutting
down
the
timber
to
making
a
retail
sale.
he
paid
one
tax.
and
except
for
certain
exemptions
in
the
statute
which
don't
affect
the
principle
here,
if
you
broke
that
down
among
little
businesses
and
one
fellow
cutting
the
trees
and
selling
them
and
somebody
else
making
lumber
and
somebody
else
making
table
and
somebody
wholesaling
and
somebody
retailing,
you
have
five
taxes.
so
the
more
business
is
broken
up,
the
more
this
tax
discriminates.
however,
that
issue
is
not
in
this
case.
that's
just
pertinent.
it
is
pertinent
in
this
respect
that
because
the
tax
is
so
fundamentally
unsound
at
any
place,
it
makes
it
more
difficult
to
appreciate
the
way
it
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce
as
it
surely
does.
and
as
to
this
first
point
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
it's
taxed
under
the
washington
act
--
but
the
washington
act,
as
we'll
come
to
later
on,
is
divided
into
a
lot
of
different
classes.
now,
i
made
the
point
before
that
we
are
--
we
are
not
merchants,
we
are
manufacturers.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
and
you're
making
really
the
same
point
now,
mr.
justice
white,
that
the
logger
is
not
a
seller
--
not
a
merchant,
he's
a
logger.
the
statute
taxes
us
on,
because
of
separate
rates,
various
activities
separately.
it
taxes
extraction
which
i
believe
is
what
that
would
come
under.
it
taxes
manufacturing,
it
taxes
wholesaling,
it
taxes
retailing,
and
there's
a
catch-all
clause
that
taxes
everything
else.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
yes,
the
difference
being
rates.
i
like
to
quote
to
some
of
these
with
one
first
point
to
quote
mr.
justice
clark
in
northwestern
states.
he
said,
“it's
beyond
dispute
that
a
state
may
not
lay
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
engaging
interstate
commerce.
for
a
reasons
which
i've
just
mentioned
in
response
to
questions
on
apportioned
gross
receipts
tax,
it's
inherently
discriminatory
in
that
point
also.”
it
was
made
by
mr.
justice
clark
in
northwestern
states.
that
is
if
it
--
by
its
very
nature,
it
tends
to
make
interstate
commerce
bear
more
than
its
fair
share.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
it
selects
incidents
and
then
it
says,
“here's
an
incident
on
which
we'll
place
a
tax.”
and
that
washington
of
course
can
tax
these
little
incidents,
so
can
somebody
else.
this
incident
of
wholesale
selling
for
example,
which
is
supposed
to
be
the
basis
of
the
tax
here
and
you
get
these
multiple
burdens.
that
was
the
reasons
that
this
very
tax
as
the
same
one,
was
held
invalid
by
this
court
in
gwin,
white
&
prince
and
the
exposition
of
that
point
is
best
made
and
there
was
somewhat
later
case
of
nippert
against
richmond.
interstate
commerce
may
of
course
become
involved
in
the
measure
of
tax.
if
it
gets
itself
so
mixed
up
with
intrastate
commerce,
that
there
isn't
any
reasonable
way
of
separating
it
too
and
that's
where
the
norton
company
got
into
trouble.
and
this
court
refused
to
upset
the
judgments,
substitute
its
own
judgment
for
that
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
when
it
held
that
norton
had
to
pay
so
much
--
a
tax
so
much
somewhere
to
the
this
with
respect
to
transactions
which
were
interstate
in
character
but
which
passed
through
and
admittedly,
intrastate
local
store
operating
within
the
business
--
within
the
state.
but
the
transactions
in
our
case
have
had
no
contact
with
any
intrastate
business
whatever.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
you
mean,
does
that
put
us
in
--
in
intrastate
business
within
the
state?
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
no.
no,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice.
if
it
did,
you
see,
we're
talking
here
about
just
one
piece
of
business.
i
could
distinguish
it
from
norton.
norton
was
an
--
a
manufacturer
of
abrasives
and
abrasive
machineries.
and
to
simplify
it,
let's
assume
if
they
sold
abrasives
in
this
local
store,
they
sold
the
machinery
merely
by
shipping
from
their
factory
in
massachusetts.
now,
the
--
the
orders
for
the
machinery
which
were
passed
through
or
deliveries
which
passed
through
the
local
store
because
they
went
along
with
this
abrasive
business
were
held
to
be
so
mixed
up
with
the
intrastate
that
you
couldn't
separate
it.
now,
if
you
say
that
we're
in
anyway
engaged
in
intrastate
business
here,
as
the
operation
of
these
dealerships,
you
have
made
us
retailers
and
destroyed
our
wholesaling
function.
in
that
case,
there's
no
tax
due
at
all
because
the
only
operation
is
retail
and
the
tax
amount
has
been
paid.
this
is
a
second
stage
that's
involved
here.
the
state
all
along
has
walked
a
tight
rope.
they
wanted
to
make
the
dealer
sort
of
part
of
general
motors,
yet
they've
been
awfully
careful
not
to
say
they're
an
agent
because
if
they
ever
said
they're
an
agent,
their
whole
case
would
fall.
if
they
--
if
we
sold
these
cars
on
consignment,
and
the
dealer
merely
as
our
agent
passed
title
to
the
retail
customer,
there
would
be
no
wholesale
transaction
and
hence
none
to
this
tax.
the
retail
tax
as
i
say
is
--
has
been
paid
by
the
dealers.
now,
discriminatory
structure
of
the
washington
tax
is
our
second
problem.
the
tax
supplies,
by
its
terms
to
manufacturing,
if
the
product
was
manufactured
within
washington,
if
the
product
is
sold
outside
of
washington,
but
only
if
it's
sold
outside.
it
applies
to
wholesaling
if
the
product
is
sold
within
the
state
no
matter
where
it's
manufactured.
but
it
does
not
apply
to
manufacturing
if
the
product
is
sold
within
the
state.
now,
our
former
statute
--
former
version
of
the
same
statute
was
held
unconstitutional
by
the
washington
court
itself.
that
version
exempted
from
tax,
from
the
tax
under
selling
activity,
receipts
which
had
been
subjected
to
the
tax
on
the
manufacturing
activity.
the
court
--
the
legislature
then
promptly
reversed
the
exemption.
and
the
washington
court
now
holds
it
constitutional
on
the
theory
that
everyone
pays
only
one
tax
on
the
wholesaling.
but
it
seems
logical
and
reasonable
if
the
original
scheme
was
unconstitutional,
mere
in
version
of
the
statute
to
produce
the
same
result,
is
not
going
to
cure
it.
the
washington
court
looks
at
only
one
section
of
the
tax
in
the
tax
law,
and
the
proper
test
is
the
entire
scheme
of
taxation.
we
neglected
to
mention
this
in
our
brief
but
we
did
cite
the
case
of
henneford
against
silas
mason
on
another
point
and
that's
exactly
what
was
involved
there.
that
was
one
of
the
early
cases
in
which
the
constitutionality
of
the
use
tax
was
challenged.
and
this
court
held
that
although
the
use
tax
standing
alone
was
obviously
invalid
because
it
applied
only
to
products
which
were
brought
into
the
state
having
been
purchased
outside,
and
never
to
--
our
products
purchased
within
the
state.
“if
the
whole
thing
was
nevertheless
constitutional
because
the
use
tax
balanced
the
sales
tax
and
equality
was
the
theme,”
said
the
court,
“of
the
entire
scheme
of
--
of
taxation.”
in
halliburton
against
reilly,
which
is
the
latest
case
on
this
subject
to
come
before
this
court
last
--
last
term,
“a
use
tax
which
otherwise
would
have
been
valid
was
held
invalid
in
part
because
it
applied
to
certain
transactions
or
bore
more
heavily
on
certain
transactions,
then
would
the
corresponding
sales
tax
had
the
transaction
been
entirely
within
the
state
of
louisiana."
and
here,
we
have
the
same
situation.
if
other
states
have
the
same
taxing
scheme
that
washington
has,
interstate
commerce
will
always
pay
twice
and
intrastate
will
always
pay
only
once.
now,
the
city
of
st.
louis
does
have
the
same
scheme
and
general
motors
has
a
factory
in
st.louis,
and
cars
manufactured
there,
a
few
of
them
are
sold
in
the
state
of
washington.
the
taxes
are
paid
twice
on
those
transactions.
once
to
the
city
of
st.
louis
for
the
privilege
of
manufacturing
in
st.
louis
and
once
to
the
state
of
washington
if
this
assessment
is
upheld
for
the
privilege
of
selling
them
to
customers
located
in
washington.
the
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
now,
that's
the
--
that's
the
point
we
were
discussing
a
little
earlier,
as
i've
said
beyond
inherent
unsoundness
of
this
type
of
tax
makes
it
difficult
to
keep
in
mind
the
difficulty
it
has
with
the
interstate
commerce.
i
see
that
it's
recess
now.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
--
but
couldn't
before
the
recess
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
is
that
our
judgment,
and
mr.
justice
black's
question,
as
to
the
policy
of
paying
this
type
of
tax
when
there
is
a
zone
office
operating
within
the
jurisdiction
has
been
confirmed
by
this
court
in
the
norton
decision
and
perhaps
in
the
field
enterprises
case
in
which
this
court
affirmed
per
curiam.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
each
of
those
cases
involved
that
type
of
tax.
field
enterprises
of
course
was
the
same
tax.
now,
the
--
these
zone
offices,
as
distinguished
from
the
one-man
branch
office
i've
mentioned
before,
do
perform
some
intrastate
functions.
they
do
receive
and
accept
some
orders.
and
we
--
we
cannot
claim
that
they
are
not
in
intrastate
commerce
as
well
as
the
interstate
with
which
we
are
here
concerned.
that
being
the
case,
under
the
norton
rule,
the
whole
thing
becomes
taxable.
i
say
we
did
that
before
this
--
this
court
decided
norton.
but
since
norton,
there
isn't
any
doubt
we'll
continue
to
do
it.
and
i
want
to
mention
due
process.
now,
if,
as
the
statute
says,
the
taxes
on
the
business
of
making
sales,
the
transactions
are
outside
the
jurisdiction
for
the
reason
that
every
element
of
the
sale
takes
place
outside
the
jurisdiction.
and
although,
the
unconstitutionality
of
this
type
of
exaction
is
now
customarily
attributed
to
the
due
process
clause,
i
point
out
that
the
same
result
was
achieved
on
numerous
occasions
before
the
due
--
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
ever
enacted
or
ever
adapted,
on
the
basic
principle
that
state
power
is
confined
to
its
own
territory.
and
the
best
exposition
of
that
principle
was
by
mr.
justice
john
marshall
harlan
in
new
york,
lake
erie
and
western
railway
against
the
pennsylvania
as
far
back
as
1889,
it
doesn't
come
up
since
because
the
due
process
clause
was
intervened.
but
if,
on
the
other
hand,
as
the
washington
court
says,
this
tax
is
on
local
activities,
that
is
the
district
managers
running
around
within
the
state.
its
measure
is
grossly
disproportion.
it
is
simply
incredible
that
a
tax
of
several
hundred
thousand
dollars
could
be
incurred
by
the
activities
of
a
few
employees
and
then
tax
much
more
than
their
aggregate
salaries
and
so
on.
and
the
tax
would
be
the
same
if
there
were
only
one
employee
in
the
state
or
if
there
were
several
thousands.
it's
wholly
unrelated
also
to
time
spent,
things
done
or
property
used
in
the
state
and
it's
wholly
unrelated
to
any
protection,
benefits
or
service
which
the
state
provides
to
our
activities,
related
quantity,
i
mean.
it
is
not
true,
as
the
washington
court
assumed,
that
once
you
find
something
that
you
can
pin
on
--
pin
onto
as
a
taxable
instrument
that
the
measure
of
the
tax
is
wholly
irrelevant.
due
process
requires
that
the
measure
still
have
some
relation
to
the
size
of
the
activity.
there
would
be
no
objection
under
due
process,
as
distinguished
from
interstate
commerce,
to
a
tax
reasonably
related
quantitatively
to
instate
activities.
for
example,
the
employment
tax
of
washington
is
paid
with
respect
to
these
employees.
there,
there's
a
reasonable
relation
that
tax
is
a
percentage
of
the
employees'
salary
and
the
benefits
from
that
tax
will
be
unemployment
benefits
if
any
of
these
people
are
thrown
out
of
business
by
the
activities
of
our
competitors,
will
be
paid
to
them
by
the
state
of
washington,
where
they
live
and
work.
but
the
reason
for
this
tax
is
the
customers
themselves
and
not
any
taxable
activity
within
the
state,
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
mr.
chief
justice.
a
part
from
my
friend
here
among
other
range
on
the
relationship
of
certain
past
or
prior
decisions
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
i
think
there's
a
very
sharp
difference
between
the
facts
in
our
case
and
those
in
field
enterprises.
field
enterprises
is
the
publisher
of
the
encyclopedia
britannica
and
what
they
were
doing
was
soliciting
retail
sales
for
that
encyclopedia,
which
is
a
fairly
expensive
retail
item,
taking
down
payments,
and
so
on,
and
doing
other
things
at
that
local
office
and
there
were
140
some
odd
salesmen
producing
a
total
of
$500,000
worth
of
business,
contrast
to
that
with
the
people
that
we
have
in
washington
and
millions
of
dollars
have
developed
there.
and
the
case
was
treated
as
one
because
it
was
affirmed
on
the
authority
of
norton
as
a
case
in
which
all
the
transactions
interstate,
though
they
were
in
character,
were
tied
in
with
an
intrastate
business
in
that
local
office
that
they
had
there.
now,
the
counsel's
reliance
on
norton
really
surprises
me
because
that's
the
best
case
there
is
on
our
side.
norton,
i
--
i
collaborated
this
retail
store
and
warehouse,
and
they
had
many
transactions
which
were
clearly
intrastate
and
which
a
tax
apply.
they
had
other
transactions
which
the
court,
lower
court
held
were
tax
because
they
was
--
they
were,
in
one
way
or
another,
passed
through
and
processed
by
that
local
office.
and
this
court
said,
“well,
we're
not
going
to
disturb
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
because
it's
too
high
to
separate
these
things
out
on
those
circumstances.”
but
this
court
said,
“the
purely
interstate
transactions
which
didn't
touch
that
office
could
not
be
taxed.”
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
office
was
connected
with
those
two
because
that
office
had
a
corp
of
engineers
who
went
around
and
advised
their
customers
on
the
use
of
these
complicated
abrasive
machines
and
so
on.
but
every
transaction
we
have
involved
here
is
a
norton
type
of
transaction.
it
has
no
relation
as
the
trial
court
found.
finding
of
fact
number
25
in
the
record
at
page
20
--
56
is
to
the
effect
that
there
was
no
relation
between
the
transactions
involved
here
and
the
other
divisions
to
which
mr.
riley
referred.
and
incidentally,
the
evidence
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan,
well,
actually
the
--
the
evidence
with
respect
to
gmac
and
united
motors
service
and
motors
holding,
and
so
on
was
excluded
by
the
trial
court
on
the
ground
that
it
was
completely
irrelevant
because
there
was
no
connection
of
this
type.
so
that's
not
a
specific
finding
but
that
was
the
ruling
on
the
exclusion.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
certainly
not,
that's
their
purpose.
that's
why
they're
in
there.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
no,
your
honor,
because
in
norton,
that
was
an
intrastate
business,
the
conduct
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
--
of
which
was
essential
to
the
interstate
sales.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
right.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that's
right.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
well,
i
wouldn't
go
that
far
because
here
we
have
purely
interstate
commerce
which
is
not,
in
anyway,
mixed
up
with
the
intrastate
commerce.
however,
the
--
the
situation
which
you
suggest
didn't
in
fact
exist.
these
people,
of
course,
held
that
otherwise
they
wouldn't
have
been
there
but
it
would
be
awful
--
going
awful
far.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
what
they
were
doing
was
strictly
interstate
commerce,
no
intrastate
commerce
whatever.
everything
they
did
was
in
furtherance
of
a
sale
of
normally
be
outside
the
state
and
then
shipped
them
into
the
state,
which
most
is
interstate
commerce.
i
--
i've
call
it
in
our
brief,
i
think
not
inadvisably
extrastate
commerce,
nothing
to
do
with
the
state
of
washington
except
these
people
who
were
in
there.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
if
they
had
an
office
which
had
intrastate
characteristics
such
as
the
zone
officers
we
were
discussing
just
before
the
recess.
and
of
course,
we
do
pay
tax
on
whether
there
is
a
zone
office.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
exactly
the
same
tax.
for
example,
the
--
the
chevrolet's
own
office
is
now
located
in
seattle
and
taxes
of
the
same
tax
were
paid
under
the
same
transactions
and
the
reason
is
that
that
zone
office
is
there
and
it
has
some
intrastate
aspects.
so
we
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
--
measure
the
tax
by
the
entire
business
including
interstate.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
oh,
accept
--
it
receives
and
accepts
orders
and
part
of
the
business
and
it
pedals
materials
which
are
used
by
the
--
by
the
dealers
in
their
own
operations
as
distinguished
in
the
wholesale
sales
that
are
involved
in
here.
and
the
--
the
principle
point
is
that
there
is
a
good
big
substantial
office
such
that
but
it
does
also,
in
addition
to
this
main
intra
--
interstate
business
carry
on
these
few
interstate
transactions
enough
to
bring
it
within
the
rule
of
norton.
there's
been
some
difficulty
in
--
on
this
gwin,
white
&
prince
question.
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
if
the
state
were
to
succeed
in
its
argument
here,
it
could
do
so
only
by
overruling
gwin,
white
&
prince
or
saying
something
the
court
has
never
said
and
perhaps,
will
not
feel
it's
in
the
position
to
say
which
is
that
in
dealing
with
this
type
of
tax,
which
now
is
imposed
on
the
vendor,
not
on
the
consumer,
which
is
the
type,
mr.
justice
rutledge
talked
about.
we
can
make
a
choice
as
between
which
--
between
two
states,
one
which
will
pay
it
and
one
which
won't.
now,
gwin,
white
&
prince
said,
“no
state
can
impose
this
tax
because
if
washington
could,
so
could
new
york,"
where
the
good
were
being
sold.
if
washington
could
impose
this
tax,
so
could
oregon,
just
as
mr.
justice
white
has
argued.
the
--
the
error
in
this
tax
is
that
it
is
an
unapportioned
tax.
after
the
decision
of
this
court
in
gwin,
white
&
prince,
the
state
of
washington
fixed
up
this
tax
insofar
as
it
applies
to
a
service
industry
and
gwin,
white
&
prince
was
a
broker,
so
that
it
is
apportioned.
and
now,
they
collect
a
tax
from
gwin,
white
&
prince
because
they
are
not
taxing
a
100%
of
the
gross
receipts,
which
is
what
they
are
doing
here.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
they
amended
it
so
that
the
--
the
tax
paid
by
a
service
industry,
which
is
gwin,
white
&
prince,
they
were
a
broker,
is
apportioned,
instead
of
being
on
the
100%
of
gross
receipts.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
what
--
what
was
the
apportionment?
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
i
don't
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
gwin,
the
--
the
tax
which
was
held
invalid,
it's
the
same
tax
in
gwin,
white
&
prince
because
it
was
unapportioned.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
the
state
is
now
collecting
from
gwin,
white
&
prince
because
it
has
changed
that
one
section
of
its
law
to
make
the
tax
apportioned.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
they've
reduced
the
--
the
percentage
of
gross
receipts
from
100
to
something
less.
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
this
will
--
i
--
i
don't
frankly
understand
counsel's
argument
with
respect
to
the
nature
of
the
tax.
and
i
--
i
just
can't
see
what
difference
it
makes
whether
you
call
it
a
tax
on
an
act
or
a
tax
on
a
privilege
or
a
tax
on
a
gross
receipt
or
a
tax
measured
by
gross
receipt.
it
seems
to
me
that
constitutionally,
as
franchise
tax
for
the
privilege
of
doing
interstate
commerce
and
exclusively
that.
and
we
find
the
assessments
invalid
because
it
is
such
a
franchise
tax
and
invalid
because
it
attributes
the
tax
to
a
minor
local
incident,
thereby,
exposing
the
entire
commerce
to
multiple
burdens
and
that's
the
thing
that
nippert
against
richmond
says
you
can't
do,
is
to
breakup
the
transaction
to
little
pieces
and
separately
tax
each
piece,
is
invalid
because
of
the
exemption
of
the
instate
manufacturer
or
seller
with
the
resulting
double
taxation
of
interstate
manufacturing
and
selling
and
single
taxation
of
the
--
of
the
entire
operation
within
the
state.
invalid
because
it
reaches
transactions
outside
the
jurisdiction
under
both
due
process
and
the
fundamental
principle
of
the
state
is
confined
to
its
own
territory.
and
finally,
invalid
because
it
is,
of
all
reason,
proportioned
activities
within
the
state.
now,
the
activities
to
which
it
must
bear
some
reasonable
apportionment
are
the
activities
of
the
people
who
are
in
the
state
and
not
to
the
things
which
go
on
in
washington.
and
as
mr.
riley
said,
the
dealer
selling
agreement
is
performed
in
washington
but
is
performed
in
washington
by
the
dealer,
not
by
general
motors.
everything
that
general
motors
does
in
performance
of
the
dealer
selling
agreement
to
which
sell
automobiles,
buy
back
parts
when
the
dealer
goes
out
of
business
under
certain
circumstances,
all
those
things
are
done
in
oregon
or
california
or
michigan.
so
that
we
have
to
look
at
the
dollar
amounts
involved
or
the
dollar
measure
here
and
compare
it
with
these
people
who
run
around,
three
of
them
for
pontiac
located
in
the
--
in
the
state
and
several
more
who
come
in
on
occasion,
make
your
regular
business
and
so
on,
but
you
add
up
all
those
activities
and
there
isn't
very
much.
and
you
cannot,
in
looking
at
the
measures,
add-on
to
that
the
activities
of
these
unrelated
divisions
because
their
activities
already
being
taxed.
there
isn't
--
they're
not
on
activity
can
be
added
to
these
activities
to
compare
what
the
measure.
they've
been
taxed
on
their
own
account.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that
was
precisely
my
point,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
they
have
to
cut
it
more
than
that.
remember
we
have
three
--
pontiac
has
three
men
in
washington
and
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
men
in
all
together.
i
think
our
payroll
is
600,000
people.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
if
it
were
actually,
your
honor,
it
might
be
something
that
we
wouldn't
care
to
litigate
just
because
of
the
trouble
but
the
principle
would
be
exactly
the
same
because
we're
talking
about
tax
base
and
not
rate.
it's
the
--
this
fact
that
when
we
sell
a
$2000
pontiac
to
a
washington
dealer,
they
want
to
tax
us
on,
no
matter
what
the
rate
is,
on
$2000,
instead
of
one
--
some
apportionment.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that's
simply
close.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that
we
pay
unconstitutional
taxes
when
the
amounts
aren't
very
big.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
just
one
remark,
mr.
chief
justice,
other
states
do
impose
taxes
on
general
motors
corporation
with
respect
to
the
income
and
so
on,
which
is
derived
from
the
sales
of
automobiles
to
customers
in
washington.
now,
those
taxes
are
apportioned
and
they
are
valid
for
that
reason.
they
are
paid
to
the
state
of
oregon.
they're
--
they
are
not
measured
by
gross
receipts
insofar
as
these
sales
are
concerned,
they
are
measured
by
net
income.
nevertheless,
it's
net
income
derived
in
part
from
sales
to
the
washington
customers
and
for
the
privilege
of
carrying
on
these
activities
in
oregon,
in
california,
in
michigan
as
measured
by
capital
stock
in
new
york
city,
has
--
has
no
relation
to
these
transactions,
has,
however,
gross
receipts
tax
which
is
apportioned
and
which
is
not
been
successfully
challenged
because
it's
apportioned.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
so
far
as
i
know,
mr.
justice
harlan,
only
two
are
--
it's
washington
and
west
virginia.
and
the
west
virginia
one
isn't
applied
quite
this
way.
illinois
had
a
tax
which
was
treated
that
way,
the
retailers'
occupation
tax,
one
is
before
is
this
court
in
norton.
but
illinois,
there
was
still
cost,
it
calls
its
tax
that
has
corrected
it
and
converted
into
a
sales
tax
by
enacting
a
complimentary
use
tax.
so
it's
now
being
made
a
pure
consumer
type
of
tax,
so
it
takes
it
out
of
this
category.
there's
also,
the
city
of
los
angeles
and
i
think
there
are
some
other
cities
and
of
course,
new
york
city.
but
new
york
city's
tax
is
apportioned
on
these
interstate
transactions.
