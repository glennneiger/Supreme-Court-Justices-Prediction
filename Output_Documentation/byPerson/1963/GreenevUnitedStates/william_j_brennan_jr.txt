justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
doolittle,
what
--
(inaudible)
as
of
the
context
today
under
1961
or
the
context
of
time
dispersed
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
is,
what
is
this
final
determination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
favorable
to
and
when,
as
of
when.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
appreciate
that.
but
as
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
this
--
in
other
words,
this
would
be
a
--
a
determination
whether
he's
entitled
of
clearance
today.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
the
day
it
was
made.
and
it's
not
--
whether
or
not,
he's
been
entitled
to
a
clearance
back
in
1952.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
--
is
that
what
the
1961
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
the
language
of
the
1960
is
something
about
unjustified.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
--
what's
that
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
that
they
might
reasonably
have
thought
whether
they
were
right
or
wrong
that
whether
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
he
is
entitled?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
fact.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
i'm
just
a
little
uncertain
still.
he
was
stripped
of
a
clearance
back
in
1952
and
there
was
a
reason
for
it.
there
was
--
now,
do
i
understand
that
unjustified
under
the
1960
procedure
would
mean
that
had
he
been
given
back
in
1952
procedure
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
(inaudible)
given
that
back
in
1952,
would
he
have
had
a
determination
that's
favorable
to
him,
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
what
you
mean?
now
we're
--
we're
what
12
years,
10
years,
seven
years
later.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
thing
that
bothers
me
mr.
doolittle,
seems
to
me
all
you're
doing
is
telling
us
(inaudible)
the
same
case
back
there
four
to
five
years
more,
we
still
have
to
avoid
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
assuming
that
they
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
