mr.
gressman,
what
happens
when
or
did
it
happen
in
this
case
that
this
man
was
suspended
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
won't
pay
--
he
was
paid
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
that
--
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
--
that
preparatory
to
suspending
clearance
or
having
a
hearing
to
revoke
a
clearance,
the
employee
is
suspended,
pending
this
determination.
and
the
determination
is
made
but
it's
reversed
by
a
court
for
a
procedural
error
per
se.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
automatically,
is
the
--
is
the
employee
entitled
to
pay
until
and
unless
the
clearance
is
properly
revoked
in
a
proper
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
--
you
don't
suggest
that
the
government
couldn't
proceed
to
revoke
the
clearance.
would
you
say
it
--
it
was
left
in
existence
by
--
by
the
court's
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
under
that
--
based
on
the
same
facts
as
--
as
the
attempted
revocation
would
appeal
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
that
the
clearance
had
said
that
--
let's
assume
the
man
didn't
have
another
job
or
that
he
wanted
his
--
he
wanted
his
clearance
and
wanted
to
work
for
the
--
for
the
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
following
this
decision,
i
suppose
the
government
could,
nevertheless,
have
proceeded
to
revoke
his
clearance
and
--
and
take
it,
through
the
facts
of
which
--
proceed
to
revoke
it
in
a
proper
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
of
--
of
whether
he's
entitled
to
clearance
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
a
final
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
final
judgment
but
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
that
particular
kind
of
a
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
didn't
--
it
didn't
indicate
that
the
government
was
not
entitled
to
revoke
his
clearance.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
effect,
i
suppose
in
--
under
--
when
they
denied
your
--
your
request
for
compensation
under
--
under
26,
i
suppose,
in
effect,
they
redetermined
it,
didn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
--
whether
you
were
or
had
been
entitled
to
a
security
clearance?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
--
but
they
must
have
determined
within
section
26
that
there
was
no
final
determination
favorable
to
the
context.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)section
26
said
expressly
when
there
has
been
a
final
determination
of
the
contractor's
eligibility
for
clearance.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
presume
that
--
they
said
that
expressly
and
there
wasn't
any
argument
about
what
it
meant.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
section
26
did
say
that
and
you
were
--
wanted
to
get
compensation
so
you
had
to
go
through
another
argument
about
whether
you
were
entitled
to
clearance
or
not,
would
you
prefer
to
go
through
it
under
the
1955
or
the
1961
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
since
--
you
do
rely
on
the
1955
regulation
and
insist
that
a
final
determination
is
necessary,
that
final
determination
has
to
take
place
under
some
--
under
the
1960
regulation
or
the
1955
regulation
is
no
longer
an
existing
fact.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
furthermore
it
is
invalid.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they're
invalid
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
did
that
to
proceed
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
which
are
--
but
--
but
the
procedures
by
which
you
would
draw
about
to
make
the
final
determination
and
it
had
to
take
place
under
a
different
set
of
regulation.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
same
standards
as
i
--
in
short
of
that
1955
regulation
would
have
established.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
--
did
the
department
of
defense
had
any
authority
to
primary
to
revoke
the
clearance
by
any
procedures
other
than
those
specified
in
the
1955
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
and
let's
assume
in
1956,
it
did
want
revoke
the
clearance,
would
it
have
had
to
use
procedures
which
ultimately
were
held
to
be
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
was
no
way
then
to
department
of
defense
could
have
revoked
the
clearance
except
by
any
--
except
in
an
illegal
way,
in
this
--
interim
years
from
which
you're
claiming?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
could
--
could
they
have
supplied
it
without
--
without
--
within
the
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there's
nothing
in
the
regulations
that
would
have
prevented
them
for
--
that's
specified
a
--
that
actually
required
a
procedure
that
would
violate
the
constitution?
