mr.
eugene
gressman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
suit
for
monetary
restitution
and
just
compensation,
which
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
claims.
the
case
is
essentially
an
aftermath
and
indeed
is
the
result
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
1959
in
the
case
known
as
greene
versus
mcelroy,
involving
the
same
petitioner
as
is
now
before
this
court.
the
opinion
of
the
majority
of
this
court
in
greene
versus
mcelroy
sets
forth
in
great
detail,
the
facts
and
the
background
which
have
led
to
this
litigation.
your
honors
are
therefore
quite
familiar
and
most
of
you
having
participated
in
that
decision
with
the
basic
facts
in
this
case,
thereby
making
it
unnecessary
to
relate
at
this
time
in
detail
the
facts
which
have
led
to
the
present
controversy.
i
think
it
will
be
necessary
only
to
highlight
the
more
significant
facts
as
they're
now
pertinent
to
the
present
litigation
and
to
relate
to
you
briefly,
the
events
that
have
occurred
subsequent
to
your
honors'
decision
in
greene
versus
mcelroy.
now,
you
will
recall
that
the
petitioner,
william
l.
greene,
was
an
eminent
aeronautical
engineer,
who
was
employed
between
the
years
of
1937
to
1953
at
a
defense
plant
known,
shorthandedly,
as
erco.
and
in
that
employment,
he
produced
notable
achievements
in
the
field
in
which
the
government
was
interested
in
and
actually
rose
to
become
vice
president
and
general
manager
of
the
corporation.
the
security
problem
which
has
given
rise
to
this
prolonged
litigation
really
had
its
beginning
in
1951,
12
years
ago.
previous
to
that,
he
had
had
three
security
clearances
from
the
government,
up
to
top
secret
clearances.
now,
as
stated
in
more
detail
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
the
prior
decision,
in
1951,
it
was
determined
by
one
of
the
then
security
boards
that
were
serious
questions
concerning
mr.
greene's
security
status.
as
a
result
of
which,
he
asked
for
a
hearing
and
a
resolution
of
these
charges
before
a
board
called
the
industrial
employment
review
board,
the
ierb.
as
a
result
of
that
hearing,
despite
the
lack
of
confrontation
or
cross-examination
of
witnesses,
the
original
determination
or
charges
were
wiped-out.
mr.
greene
was
found
to
be
a
good
security
risk
and
that
his
continued
employment
was
found
to
be
consistent
with
the
national
security,
and
both
he
and
erco
were
informed
that
he
was
authorized
to
work
on
secret
contract
work
in
connection
with
government
classified
information
at
the
plant.
now,
this
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
january
of
1952.
mr.
eugene
gressman
and
this
becomes
important
in
this
present
litigation,
because
as
i
shall
show
briefly,
in
a
few
moments.
this,
at
the
present
time,
is
the
last
piece
of
paper
in
petitioner's
security
file.
this
clearance
--
this
determination
in
1952
by
the
ierb,
by
judicial
action
is
now
at
the
last
piece
of
paper,
which
appears
in
petitioner's
file.
now,
another
year
elapses
in
1953,
whereas
your
honors
will
recall,
the
--
without
any
notice,
warning
or
hearing,
the
secretary
of
the
navy,
based
upon
his
own
examination
of
the
case
file,
summarily
reversed
this
determination
of
the
ierb
and
notified
erco
to
exclude
mr.
greene
from
its
plant
facilities
because
his
employment,
he
said,
was
not
consistent
with
the
national
security
--
continued
access
to
classified
information
was
inconsistent
to
the
national
security.
erco
had
no
alternative
but
to
discharge
the
petitioner.
and
he
was
discharged
shortly
thereafter,
precisely
april
23,
1953.
now,
that
date
is
now
important
because
that
is
the
date
upon
which
the
monetary
damages
began
to
accrue,
which
is
the
subject
matter
of
the
present
litigation.
but
from
april
23,
1953,
his
loss
of
income
began.
now,
you
will
also
recall
that
the
petitioner
made
strenuous
efforts
to
overcome
the
determination
of
the
secretary
of
navy
and
he
was
given
at
least
two
hearings
before
the
various
security
boards.
in
1954,
he
had
a
so-called
hearing
before
one
of
the
review
boards
which
resulted
in
a
reaffirmation
of
the
secretary's
determination.
he
followed
that
with
another
hearing
both
then
--
with
the
same
result
in
1956.
so
that
there
were
--
in
that
--
in
fact,
three
adverse
determinations
made
as
to
petitioner's
security
status.
now,
the
--
in
the
--
before
the
end
of
this
round
of
security
hearings
between
1953
and
1956,
the
petitioner
had
filed
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
an
equitable
action
seeking
both
equitable
and
declaratory
relief
against
these
proceedings,
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
hearings
and
the
procedures
on
the
basis
that
they
violated
his
constitutional
rights
to
confrontation
and
cross-examination.
and
that
suit
was
expressly
grounded
upon
the
fact,
among
others,
that
petitioner
was
then
suffering
substantial
and
irreparable
economic
interim.
he
set
forth
--
now
i
think,
the
precise
dollar
amount
which
he
was
then
suffering
computed
from
that
date
of
april
23,
1953.
now,
this
action,
as
you
know,
came
up
through
the
court
system
and
to
this
court
and
resulted
in
the
decision
in
1959,
which
very
narrowly
but
very
significantly
held,
that,
"in
the
absence
of
explicit
authorization
from
either
the
president
or
congress,
the
respondents,"
that
is
the
government
officials,
"were
not
empowered
to
deprive
petitioner
of
his
job."
and
i
repeat,
"were
not
empowered
to
deprive
petitioner
of
his
job
in
a
proceeding
in
which
he
was
not
afforded
the
safeguards
of
confrontation
and
cross-examination."
now,
this
decision
and
its
implications,
i
believe,
are
evident
and
i
believe
they
are
controlling
of
the
present
for
litigation
because
that
holding,
while
it
did
not
pretend
or
did
not
extend
to
a
determination
of
the
petitioner's
right
to
access
to
classified
information
or
did
it
--
or
the
merits
of
his
security
status,
nevertheless,
it
did
recognize
certain
fundamental
elements
which
are
significant
in
his
present
back
pay
suit.
it
reflected
in
--
in
its
holding
that
petitioner's
right
to
a
job
and
his
right
to
pursue
his
chosen
profession,
free
from
unwarranted
government
interference,
was
a
right
or
was
a
property
or
liberty
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment
so
that
it
is
and
under
--
it
is
--
the
decision
reflects
a
recognition
that
the
government,
by
depriving
this
petitioner
of
his
job,
had
in
effect
infringed
upon
constitutionally
protected
rights.
more
than
that,
there
was
expressed
recognition
given
in
the
majority
and
the
dissenting
opinions
of
this
court
that
this
petitioner
was
in
fact
suffering
substantial
economic
monetary
loss
as
a
result
of
this
governmental
action.
i
call
your
honors'
attention
to
footnote
21,
in
the
majority
opinion
of
this
court,
where
the
court
quoted
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
which
said,
"that
we
have
no
doubt
that
greene
has
in
fact
been
injured."
he
was
forced
out
of
a
job
that
paid
him
$18,000
per
year.
he
has
since
been
reduced,
so
far
as
this
record
shows,
to
working
as
an
architectural
draftsman
at
a
salary
of
some
$4400
per
year.
even
more
expressly
was
the
statement
of
mr.
justice
clark,
in
his
dissenting
opinion
on
page
513,
where,
in
referring
to
the
action
of
the
court,
he
said
that
greene
will
now
claim
as
--
as
literally,
reimbursement
for
his
loss
of
wages,
and
a
reference
is
there
made
to
the
companion
case
decided
that
day
of
taylor
versus
mcelroy.
this
claim,
mr.
justice
clark
said,
will
date
back
to
1953.
his
salary
at
that
time
was
$18,000
a
year.
now,
the
facts
that
he
states
are
entirely
accurate
and
his
prediction
has
come
true.
this
is
exactly
the
nature
and
the
--
the
basis
of
the
present
monetary
claim
filed
by
this
petitioner.
so
that
there
was
a
general
recognition
and
an
understanding
by
this
court
that,
as
a
result
of
this
unauthorized
action
of
the
government,
this
petitioner
was
suffering
substantial
and
serious
economic
injury.
now,
the
reference
which
mr.
justice
clark
had
made
to
the
taylor
case
is
also
interesting
because
here,
you
will
recall
that,
in
that
companion
case
of
taylor,
the
--
or
the
--
shortly
before
the
case
came
on
for
argument,
the
secretary
of
defense
had
granted
mr.
taylor
a
security
clearance.
and
the
government
then
moved
and
this
court
eventually
held
that
the
case
was
thereby
mooted.
and
mr.
taylor,
up
until
that
point,
had
been
in
the
same
situation
with
mr.
greene.
upon
the
representation
of
the
solicitor
general
that
mr.
taylor,
as
a
result
of
this
action
of
the
secretary,
would
be
eligible
under
the
then
applicable
regulations
for
rest
--
compensation
or
reinstitution
for
his
lost
wages.
this
court
dismissed
the
case
as
mooted.
now,
the
only
applicable
regulation,
then
in
effect,
which
--
under
which
mr.
taylor
could
have
been
and
was
in
fact
paid,
is
monetary
compensation,
was
paragraph
26
of
the
1955
department
of
defense
regulations
or
direct
duty,
then
in
effect.
that
is
precisely
the
same
regulation,
the
same
paragraph
under
which
this
petitioner,
mr.
greene,
has
filed
his
claim
for
monetary
damages.
and
the
government
concedes,
there
is
no
dispute,
but
that
our
claim
was
in
fact
filed
under
paragraph
26
and
must
ultimately
and
exclusively
be
judged
by
the
provisions
of
that
paragraph
of
the
1955
regulation.
the
sum
total,
in
other
words,
of
the
opinion
and
the
judgment
of
this
court
in
greene
versus
mcelroy,
i
submit,
contains
all
the
essential
ingredients
necessary
to
examine,
to
understand
and
to
pass
upon
the
right
of
this
petitioner
to
his
monetary
relief
under
paragraph
26
of
the
1955
directive.
now,
following
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
greene
case,
the
matter
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
the
injury
of
an
appropriate
order
and
that
order
becomes
very
significant
at
this
point.
it
was
drafted
by
the
government
attorney,
consented
to
by
both
parties,
signed
by
the
district
judge.
and
the
order
says
that
in
light
of
this
court's
opinion
in
greene
versus
mcelroy,
it
is
ordered
that
the
action
of
the
secretary
of
defense
and
his
subordinates,
in
finally
revoking
plaintiff's
security
clearance,
was
and
is
hereby
declared
to
be
not
validly
authorized.
and
now
comes
a
significant
sense,
further
ordered
that
any
and
all
rulings,
orders
or
determinations,
wherein
or
whereby
plaintiff's
security
clearance
was
revoked
are
hereby
annulled
and
expunged
from
all
records
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
now,
let
us
see
what
this
does
to
--
to
the
prior
determinations.
this
means,
in
effect,
that
there
has
been
judicial
expungement
from
the
--
all
the
records
of
the
government,
the
order
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
in
1953
and
the
two
subsequent
reaffirmations
of
that
determination
by
the
various
review
or
appeals
of
the
boards.
leaving
in
effect,
as
i
said
previously,
the
1952
favorable
administrative
determination
of
the
ierb,
which
is
the
last
and
the
only
determination
which
can
now
be
said
to
be
in
existence
and
which
i
submit
is
the
only
determination
that
has
any
relevance
or
meaning
as
to
the
years
in
question
covering
--
covered
by
this
monetary
claim.
mr.
eugene
gressman
as
i
recall,
there
was
originally
in
1951,
a
statement
by
the
--
the
original
board
which
said
that
there
were
serious
questions
about
his
security
status
as
a
result
of
which
he
was
voluntarily
put
on
favorable
by
the
erco
and
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
i'm
not
certain
about
that
but
in
any
event,
he
was
fully
restored
by
the
action
of
the
--
the
eisb
--
eirb
in
19
--
in
january
of
1952.
now,
there
is
nothing
more
that
happens
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
this
will
depend
upon
whether
there
has
of
course
been
a
--
a
final
determination
favorable
to
that
employee.
in
--
in
response
to
your
--
to
the
precise
question
here,
i
am
not
aware
that
there
is
any
outstanding
unresolved
charge
or
suspension
against
this
petitioner
by
the
sequence
of
the
events
which
appeared
quite
fully
in
--
in
the
prior
opinion.
but
you
will
note
there
that
there
was
this
far
so-called
"final
clearance"
in
1952.
the
next
thing
that
occurs,
a
year
later,
is
the
summary
action
of
the
secretary
of
--
of
navy
without
any
additional
or
new
charge
or
suspension
ever
having
been
established.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
i
--
as
far
as
the
proceeding
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
you
mean
as
of
1953
or
now?
mr.
eugene
gressman
no.
mr.
eugene
gressman
of
course,
your
honor.
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
--
there
is
full
power,
admitted
power
in
the
government
and
the
defense
department
to
institute
a
--
a
new
proceeding
to
determine
his
present
security
eligibility
if
he
is
in
the
position
where
he
now
wants
to
work
on
--
in
defense
work
or
for
the
government
or
for
any
other
purpose
in
which
requires
a
security
clearance.
what
we
are
concerned
with
in
this
case
is
looking
backwards
to
a
period,
when
judicial
action
has
resulted
in
revoking,
annulling
and
expunging
certain
determinations,
reinstating
in
effect
for
past
period
only,
not
for
the
present
but
for
a
past
period
of
time
for
which
we
claim
damages
and
claim
that
these
damages
are
irreparable
have
accrued.
we
now
look
back
to
see
what
the
impact
is
of
these
judicial
determinations
and
actions.
now,
what
a
--
we
--
we
cannot
now
rewrite
the
history
between
1953
and
1959
or
1960,
which
is
the
only
period
of
which
we're
now
concerned
with,
but
there's
no
question
about
what
they
could
at
1963.
if
you
are
eligible
and
--
and
or
needed
as
security
access
eligibility,
the
government
could
make
a
--
a
full
scale
hearing
and
determination
of
this
point.
but
my
point
is
that
there
--
on
the
historic
record,
as
amended
by
judicial
action
between
1953
and
1960
at
least,
there
is
no
outstanding
suspension
or
charge
by
which
anything
can
now
be
resolved
for
that
period.
the
--
there
was
a
letter,
i
think
i
pointed
this
out
in
one
of
the
footnotes
in
my
reply
brief,
there
was
a
letter
which
was
contained
in
the
--
which
reiterated
the
same
little
charges
which
had
been
the
subject
to
the
original
proceeding
which
lead
to
this
hearing
and
determination
by
the
--
one
of
these
appeal
boards
following
the
secretary
of
navy's
determination.
now,
that
was
precisely
the
type
of
hearing,
the
type
of
determination
which
this
court
ruled,
could
not,
was
not
authorized
and
the
--
it
seems
to
me
the
--
the
entire
action
including
the
or
the
letter
setting
up
the
hearing,
setting
forth
the
charges,
had
been
wiped
off
the
records
of
the
government.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
will,
your
honor.
now,
we
filed,
as
a
result
of
the
situation,
as
it
existed
then
following
the
expungement
order,
a
claim
for
restitution,
under
paragraph
26
with
the
department
of
defense.
and
we
were
asked
and
did
supply
to
them
the
appropriate
financial
data
under
oath
and
this
was
filed
in
december
of
1959,
seven
months
prior
to
the
promulgation
of
the
1960
regulation.
this
matter
was
kept
under
consideration
by
the
department
of
defense
for
a
period
of
a
year
and
a
half
intersperse
with
various
respondents
between
counsel
and
the
department.
and
finally,
in
june
of
1961,
the
department
of
defense
finally
rejected
petitioner's
claim
under
paragraph
26
of
the
1955
regulation,
stating
that,
"it
has
been
determined
by
the
department
of
defense
that
mr.
greene
does
not
qualify
for
a
monetary
restitution
under
the
provisions
of
paragraph
26."
now,
i
submit
that
that
is
the
true,
the
only
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedy
principle
that
is
applicable
in
this
case.
we
pursued,
we
exhausted,
we
obtained
a
final
administrative
denial
of
our
claim
under
paragraph
26,
after
a
year
and
a
half
of
consideration
by
the
department.
now,
that
denial
of
the
claim
was
coupled
immediately
with
an
offer
to,
if
we
would
request
it,
an
offer
to
hold
a
new
security
clearance
hearing
under
the
provisions
of
the
1960
regulation
which,
as
i
said,
was
adopted
subsequent,
seven
months
after
we
had
originally
filed
the
paragraph
26
claim.
we
took
the
position
then,
we
took
--
take
the
position
now
that
we
were
not
compelled
to
follow
such
an
administrative
possibility,
a
new
hearing,
reopening
it
up
again,
the
same
charges,
the
same
matters
that
had
been
going
in
to
over
the
past
12
years.
we
said
that
we
have
complied
with
paragraph
26
at
this
point.
and
the
1960
regulation
has
no
pertinence,
no
bearing
upon
a
claim
which
has
matured
under
paragraph
26.
and
as
a
result
of
the
defense
department's
denial,
we
are
forced
to
file
this
suit
in
the
court
of
claims,
alleging
that
we
had
complied
with
the
regulation
and
adding
to
it
a
claim
under
the
just
compensation
clause.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true,
your
honor,
within
the
precise
language
of
paragraph
26
as
i
shall
show
it.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
the
--
there's
been
a
--
a
misunderstanding
in
the
court
of
claims
as
to
what
is
a
real
meaning
and
impact
of
the
exhaustion
doctrine
here.
because
if
we
are
right
in
our
interpretation
of
paragraph
26,
and
i
submit
there
can
be
no
question
about
it,
but
if
--
if
we
are
right,
there
is
an
--
we
have
complied
with
paragraph
26,
there
is
nothing
more
to
exhaust
under
the
1960
regulation
or
any
other
--
any
other
regulation.
if
we
have
not
complied
with
paragraph
26,
it
seems
to
me
we're
--
we
simply
have
not
stated
the
cause
of
action
in
the
court
of
claims.
we
can
come
in
there
and
sue
under
an
administrative
or
executive
regulation,
only
if
we
can
show
that
we
have
complied
with
it.
and
we
have
complied
with
it,
i
submit
so
clearly
that
there
is
nothing
more
to
exhaust.
this
seems
to
me
a
circular
reasoning
which
seeks
to
impose
upon
us
an
entirely
different
kind
of
a
hearing
under
another
regulation
which
has
no
relation,
particularly
if
we
are
right
in
our
contention
that
we
have
fully
complied
with
paragraph
26.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
suppose
that's
one
way
of
saying
it,
your
honor,
whether
or
not
we
stated
a
claim
or
cause
of
action
or
in
the
reverse
side
whether
there
was
jurisdiction
or
should
have
been
exercised
there.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can
understand
whether
or
not
we
should
go
back
to
the
night
for
another
hearing
only
after
you
interpret
paragraph
26.
you
can't
determine
whether
we
have
to
go
back
for
a
new
security
hearing
without
first
reading
paragraph
26
and
deciding
whether
or
not
we
have
complied
with
it.
but
i
say
that
making
that
kind
of
a
decision
as
to
whether
we
have
complied
or
not
is
an
end
of
the
matter,
and
you'll
really
never
get
to
a
real
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedy
doctrine
here.
now,
as
i
say,
it
is
conceded
here
and
properly
so
that
the
only
basis
of
our
claim
which
--
or
the
proper
basis
of
our
administrative
claim
here
is
paragraph
26
and
that
we
are
judged
and
must
be
--
the
issue
must
be
resolved
under
paragraph
26.
now,
that
it
seemed
as
i
have
said,
i
think,
is
clearly
established
in
terms
of
our
compliance.
paragraph
26
is
very
simple
in
its
critical
language.
it
says
that
we
are
entitled
to
monetary
restitution
in
cases
where
a
final
determination
is
favorable
to
a
contractor
employee.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
that's
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
this
--
this
is
precisely
what
i
want
to
address
myself
to
because
i
think
this
is
the
critical
issue
in
the
case
as
to
--
on
compliance.
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
we
have
satisfied
that
requirement
of
final
determination
in
one
or
two
sentences.
in
the
first
place,
this
decision
in
greene
versus
mcelroy
is
in
and
of
itself
a
final
determination
favorable
to
the
employee.
now,
i
--
of
course,
it
was
not
a
determination
in
terms
of
the
merits
of
his
security
status,
it
was
a
final
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
a
final
determination
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
favorable
to
him
in
terms
of
the
lack
of
authority
of
the
government
to
do
what
it
did
to
this
petitioner.
mr.
eugene
gressman
in
that
particular
kind
of
a
proceeding.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
that
isn't
--
but
i
submit,
that
a
determination
in
terms
of
lack
of
authority
is
just
as
meaningful,
just
as
final,
just
as
favorable
as
a
--
a
determination
in
terms
of
the
merits.
certainly,
procedure
is
not
to
be
distinguished
from
merits
in
terms
of
the
nature
or
the
--
the
ultimate
impact,
the
conclusiveness
of
a
determination.
if
a
court
is
--
if
this
supreme
court
holds
that
a
lower
court
lacks
jurisdiction
to
convict
the
defendant
of
a
crime,
that
is
certainly
a
final
determination
even
though
a
favorable
determination,
even
though
it
does
not
decide
that
question
in
terms
of
his
innocence
or
guilt.
now,
a
second
thing
comes
into
play
here
in
terms
of
a
final
favorable
determination
and
this
goes
exactly
to
the
administrative
determination.
again,
i
emphasize
that
we're
dealing
with
a
past
period
of
time
upon
which
judicial
action
has
--
has
made
an
impact.
as
a
result
of
the
expungement
order
of
the
district
court
on
remand,
as
i
have
pointed
out,
there
has
been
--
wiped
off
the
government
records,
the
three
adverse
determinations
on
the
merits
of
this
petitioner's
security
status.
reinstating,
i
say,
for
the
period
involved,
the
last,
the
only
determination
on
his
--
on
the
merits,
the
determination
of
january
1952
of
the
ierb
which
authorized
him
to
work
on
secret
contract
work.
now,
i
submit
that
by
the
judicial
action,
working
backwards
on
this
period
of
time,
there
has
been
a
final
--
a
reinstatement
of
a
final
favorable
administrative
determination.
now,
i
suggest
further
that
paragraph
26,
as
it
was
explained
to
congress
by
the
department
of
defense
officials,
was
said
to
be
designed
to
achieve
equity
and
justice
for
those
employees
who
were
relieved
of
their
jobs
at
the
suggestion
of
government
officials.
well,
i
suggest
that
the
reading
that
i
have
suggested
at
paragraph
26
is
compelled
by
any
standards
of
equity
and
justice
which
were
said
to
be
the
underlying
concepts
of
paragraph
26.
to
refuse
to
acknowledge
the
loss
and
sufferings,
to
refuse
to
acknowledge
that
there
was
not
--
that
there
was
a
final
determination
by
this
supreme
court
and
by
the
district
court
favorable
to
this
contractor
employee,
i
think
would
be
the
height
of
inequity
and
injustice
which
paragraph
26
was
designed
to
avoid,
because
as
i
repeat,
the
decision
of
this
court
demonstrates
that
the
government
here
was
infringing
upon
constitutionally
protected
property
rights.
and
there
was
irreparable
injury
caused
to
this
petitioner
which
can
never
be
wiped
out,
can
never
be
--
can
never
be
made
whole
unless
paragraph
26
is
read
in
the
matter
in
which
i
suggest.
and
i
think
it
is
also
inequitable
and
unjust
to
condition
his
right
to
relieve
that
this
junction,
upon
any
new
proceeding,
any
new
security
determination
which
is
unrelated,
i
suggest,
to
the
satisfaction
of
paragraph
26.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
--
exactly
right,
your
honor.
i
don't
see
all
--
there
can
be
any
equity
or
justice
in
--
in
reopening
the
same
old
charges,
the
same
questions
which
have
been
plaguing
this
petitioner,
which
have
been
in
effect
expunge
in
a
note
or
because
of
the
complete
lack
of
authority
to
do
what
the
government
did
to
this
petitioner
during
the
years
in
question.
again,
i
reiterate,
repeating
what
i
said
to
mr.
justice
white
that
there's
no
question
but
if
what
--
the
government
is
wholly
protected
at
this
point
if
the
petitioner
were
in
a
position
to
seek
or
need
security
clearance,
they
could
reopen
this
point.
they
can
make
a
new
determination.
but
we're
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
there
--
there
was
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
there
was
no
indication
that
that
point
was
ever
raised.
it
was
strictly,
as
i
understand
it,
a
legal
position,
a
legal
interpretation
of
paragraph
26
in
terms
of
did
we
have
a
final
determination
favorable
to
the
employee.
the
only
thing
we
were
ever
asked
during
the
course
of
--
of
this
negotiation
or
discussion
with
the
department
was
"please
present
your
legal
position,
your
legal
interpretation
of
paragraph
26."
there
was
never
any
question
raised
about
his
security
status
or
the
merits
of
--
of
the
original
charges.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
that's
on
a
legal
basis,
yes,
they
must
have
done
that.
now,
the
position
of
the
government,
it
seems
to
me
on
this
question
of
interpreting
paragraph
26,
is,
in
my
judgment,
somewhat
confused.
i've
tried
to
point
that
out
in
some
detail
in
the
reply
brief
and
i
will
not
go
into
it
in
any
detail
here.
except
to
say
that
basically,
it
ignores
the
settled
rule
that
an
executive
agency
is
rigorously
bound
by
the
regulation
which
it
has
promulgated.
and
that
having
promulgated
paragraph
26,
it
seems
to
me,
it
is
bound
by
the
language
of
paragraph
26
as
it
is,
as
it
was
written.
the
chenery
and
the
vitarelli
line
of
cases
fully
established
that
general
principle.
but
instead,
the
government
here,
in
its
brief
and
throughout
this
case,
has
completely
intermixed
the
1955
regulation
and
the
1960
regulation
taking
from
the
1960
regulation,
what
it
does
not
find
in
the
1955
and
amending
or
changing
the
1960
regulation
right
before
our
eyes
here,
exciting
out.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
think
that
would
be
controlling,
your
honor,
yes.
now,
this
is
what
they
tried
to
say
but
it
--
then
this
is,
in
effect,
is
what
the
1960
regulation
says.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
don't
know
--
in
--
in
--
on
your
premise,
i
don't
believe
there'd
be
any
distinction
there
and
if
we
--
in
either
cases,
i
understand
your
question.
we
would
be
going
through
a
new
security
hearing
as
a
condition
through
us
--
to
getting
back
pay.
now,
i
don't
know
if
there'd
be
any
--
any
real
difference
between
the
kinds
of
hearing
then
involved.
but
the
--
in
--
in
addition
of
course,
the
1960
regulation
has
established
new
procedures
which
in
and
of
themselves
may
have
constitutional
questions
attached
to
them.
they
tried,
they
say,
to
--
to
comply
with
certain
of
the
comments
and
--
and
reservations
of
this
court
regarding
confrontation
and
cross-examination
but
there
still
would
be
a
possibility
of
questions
being
raised
as
to
whether
there
has
been
complete,
adequate
compliance
even
there.
but
in
any
event,
as
i
read
the
government's
position
now,
they
apparently
say
that
paragraph
26
incorporates
at
the
very
least,
the
expressed
requirement
of
the
1960
regulation
that
there'd
be
a
final
administrative
determination
on
the
merits
subsequent
to
the
original
suspension
or
revocation.
now,
i
submit
that
the
language
of
paragraph
26
simply
does
not
say
that
and
that
it
is
completely
impermissible
to
read
it
into
it
by
implication
and
certainly
impermissible
by
reading
into
it
from
paragraph
5
(c)
of
the
1960
directive.
mr.
eugene
gressman
it's
five
years
later,
exactly.
19
--
in
1955
they
say,
in
cases
where
a
final
determination
is
favorable
to
--
to
a
contractor
employee,
but
in
1965,
years
later,
they
become
very
precise
and
expand
upon
this
and
say,
"if
an
applicant
suffers
a
loss
of
earnings,
resulting
directly
from
a
suspension
or
revocation,
and
at
a
later
date,
a
final
administrative
determination
was
made
in
his
favor,
then
you
may
get
monetary
restitution."
now,
i
submit
there's
a
significant
and
a
meaningful
difference
between
those
two
standards
that
it
is
a
recognition
here
by
the
drafters
that
they
omitted
the
term
"administrative"
in
the
1955
regulation.
they
pull
a
gap
(inaudible)
hole
and
they
require
also
that
it
--
that
there'd
be
a
determination
at
a
later
date
after
the
revocation
--
the
revocation
has
occurred.
now,
i
submit
that
there
must
be
a
presumption
here
that
they
meant
to
make
a
change
and
did
make
a
change
in
the
nature
of
the
regulation.
but
we
come
back
to
the
admitted
fact,
the
concession
that
our
claim
was
filed
under
the
1955
regulation
and
that
we
are
bound
by
that
interpretation
--
that
language.
and
our
claim
is
to
be
resolved
in
light
of
the
--
the
rule
as
it
was
originally
written.
and
we
get
back
again
back
of
that
to
the
rule
that
i
stated
a
little
earlier
that
an
administrative
agency,
an
executive
agency
must
be
rigorously
bound
by
the
language
that
it
has
itself
promulgated.
now,
on
that
basis,
it
seems
to
me
completely
impermissible
and
unwarrantable
to
read
in
to
the
1955
regulation
what
did
not
appear
until
the
1960
regulation
was
adapted,
after
this
claim
was
--
was
filed.
and
as
an
addendum
even
to
that,
i
submit,
that
we
do
have,
by
judicial
action,
a
reinstatement
of
a
prior
administrative
determination
on
the
merits.
if
you
want
to
say
that
--
that
that
regulation
--
that
determination
of
the
ierb
is
the
only
thing
that
covers
petitioner's
security
status
for
the
years
in
question.
now,
i
submit
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
purpose
of
the
regulation.
there's
certainly
no
overwriting
public
interest
or
governmental
interest
which
would
justify
this
truncated
resolution
or
determination
or
reading
of
the
paragraph
26.
as
i've
said,
the
government
is
fully
protected
that
this
petitioner
ever
wants
to
work
in
an
--
a
defense
contract
and
need
to
security
clearance.
but
all
they're
offering
him
now
is
an
access
eligibility
determination
which
he
does
not
need,
he
does
not
want,
he
is
not
working
now
in
a
defense
industry.
and
under
the
government's
own
regulation,
the
defense
manual,
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
seek
such
an
access
clearance
until
and
--
and
unless
he
is
employed
by
a
defense
contractor.
this
is,
in
a
sense,
nothing
but
an
advisory
opinion
that
they
are
asking
us
to
go
through
to
achieve
monetary
restitution.
and
if
they
were
to
find
that
he
presently
is
not
eligible
to
access
eligi
--
access
to
classified
information,
then
they
would
presumably
deny
his
monetary
claim
despite
the
fact
that
that
is
a
finding
only
in
terms
of
his
present
eligibility,
ignoring
completely
the
fact
that
we're
dealing
with
a
period
long
since
passed
between
1953
and
1960.
and
there
is
no
inconsistency
between,
if
you
will,
present
ineligibility
and
eligibility
under
paragraph
26
for
a
period
of
time
that
is
long
gone
by.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
that,
of
course,
has
not
been
determined.
it
had
not
--
not
had
the
chance
yet
to
take
--
make
a
position
or
--
or
determination
of
that
in
the
court
of
claims.
i
would
think
that
that
would
--
the
earliest
possible
date
would
either
be
this
court's
decision
in
june
of
1959
or
the
expungement
order
of
the
district
court
in
december
of
1959.
now,
we
made
the
claim,
i
think,
in
the
district
--
in
the
court
of
claims
riding
on
--
into
the
entry
of
its
judgment
or
determination
by
the
court
of
claims.
but
i
think
that
is
--
would
be
subject
to
argument
as
to
when
the
precise
cutoff
date
would
be
but
i
--
it
certainly
could
not
be
before
either
this
court's
judgment
or
--
or
the
district
court's
order.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
he
was
forced
to
change
entirely
his
profession.
i
mean,
as
aeronautical
engineer,
he
could
not
pursue
that
profession
because
any
position
in
that
profession
would
require
a
--
a
security
clearance
which
he
could
not
--
could
not
get.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
and
he
tried
if
he
want
to
go
back
and
tried
it
again
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
even
though
it's
free
but
as
a
result
of
this,
he
was
forced
into
an
entirely
different
line
of
construction
engineering
and
he
built
himself
up
to
--
in
--
in
that
area
which
is
entirely
unnecessary
in
which
position
or
profession,
in
which
to
obtain
security
clearance
because
most
of
the
entire
--
all
of
the
construction
work
on
which
he
is
engaged
now
is
non-contractual
or
at
least,
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned,
requires
no
security
clearance.
so
he's
built
up
an
entirely
new
life
and
entirely
new
profession.
but
during
the
period
which
we
are
speaking
of,
when
he
was
struggling
and
suffered
great
economic
loss
during
that
period,
losses
which
are
acknowledged,
that
it
--
that
is
the
period
which
is
--
is
critical
here
and
which
paragraph
26
was
designed
and
does
provide
a
means
for
making
him
whole.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
well,
i
think
that
would
be
subject
to
recapitulation
and
determination
in
the
court
of
claims
on
the
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
we
do
have
the
--
the
just
compensation
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
claim
under
the
constitution,
i
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
think
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
we
--
well,
we're
not
--
i
don't
want
to
be
in
the
position
of
abandonment
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
i
don't
have
the
means.
i
think
it
--
at
the
very
least,
as
i
have
pointed
out,
it
--
it
bolsters
the
reason
for
interpreting
paragraph
26
to
make
him
whole.
now,
it's
rather
interesting,
your
honor,
that
in
the
last
paragraph
of
the
1960
regulation
which
provides
for
monetary
restitution
on
this
different
basis,
it
says
that
any
recovery
under
that
regulation
shall
be
completely
--
on
the
entire
means
of
recovery
against
the
united
states.
it
says
here,
"payments
under
this
provision
shall
be
in
full
satisfaction
of
any
or
all
claims
of
whatever
nature
they
maybe
which
the
applicant
has
or
may
assert
against
the
united
states
as
well
as
against
the
department
of
defense
and
other
agencies."
well,
i
think
if
that
is
true,
if
that
is
proper
to
make
that
limitation,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
at
the
moment
whether
that
is
also
on
the
1955
regulation
but
assuming
that
it
is,
i
still
think
that
if
you
have
another
basis
on
the
constitution
that
is
--
is
forbidden
to
you
by
a
virtue
of
such
a
provision,
i
think
that
at
very
least
it
indicates
a
strong
reason
why
these
paragraphs
should
be
interpreted
to
give
you
the
restitution
to
which
you
might
otherwise
be
entitled.
mr.
eugene
gressman
mr.
chief
justice,
i
only
have
a
few
statements
to
make
in
concerning
this
case
as
to
the
reasons
which
we
feel
compellingly
require
the
interpretation
of
paragraph
26
in
accordance
with
the
way
we
view
that
language
in
there.
first
of
all,
we
are
concerned
here
with
solely
with
a
past
period
of
time.
if
we
are
right
as
to
our
reading
of
the
final
favorable
determination
of
a
judicial
nature,
that
determination
was
made
in
--
at
least
in
1959.
and
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
continuing
claim
for
damages
as
of
today
or
tomorrow
or
next
week.
we
are
concerned
with
a
period
of
time
which
has
elapsed,
and
during
which
accrued
damages
have
occurred
where
there
was
a
cause
and
infringement
of
constitutional
rights.
and
i
suggest
that
we
must
view
the
--
the
damaged
claim
in
light
of
that
--
of
those
past
events
which
cannot
now
be
undone
or
re-written
nor
can
there'd
be
authority
invested
to
do
what
this
court
held,
there
was
no
authority
for
that
period
of
time.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
both
orally
and
in
the
brief,
the
government
has
made
a
most
significant
concession
in
interpreting
and
applying
paragraph
26.
mr.
doolittle
correctly
states
the
position
that
is
reflected
in
his
brief
on
page
14
when
he
says
that
the
critical
determination
that
they
suggest
to
be
made
as
of
today,
1963,
relates
not
to
whether
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
security
clearance
between
1953
and
at
least
1959,
but
whether
he
is
eligible
as
of
this
very
moment
which
has
no
relationship
to
whether
or
not
he
should
have
been
entitled
to
a
security
clearance
during
the
years
in
question.
now,
if
the
justification
for
the
government's
conditioning
of
monetary
restitution
under
being
a
final
favorable
determination
is
that
the
government
should
not
be
paying
off
money
to
a
man
who
was
a
security
risk.
this
interpretation
that
they
suggest
does
not
need
that
consideration
at
all.
because
as
your
honors
have
already
noted,
there
is
no
necessary
relationship
between
a
man
who
is
today
a
security
risk
but
who
may
not
have
been
a
security
risk
during
the
years
in
question.
indeed,
it
--
the
--
then
the
only
reference
that
there
is
in
the
1960
regulation
to
re-examining
this
past
period
of
time
relates
to
what
mr.
justice
brennan
was
referring
to
in
the
requiring
of
a
finding
that
the
former
administrative
determination
was
unjustified.
now,
whatever
that
word
unjustified
may
mean
it
completely
has
dropped
out
of
this
case
because
they
state
that
the
department
of
defense
has
notified
it
--
the
department
of
justice
that
this
kind
of
a
showing
will
not
be
required
in
petitioner's
case.
they
have
amended
the
1960
regulation
to
fit
mr.
greene's
case
and
they
are
not
going
to
read
that
and
try
to
determine
whether
former
determinations
which
incidentally
were
expunged,
were
unjustified
or
not.
they
are
concentrating
entirely
upon
whether
or
not
he
is
as
of
this
moment
or
as
of
the
time
when
we
make
a
demand
for
a
hearing.
he
is
then
and
in
the
future
eligible
for
access
authorization.
now,
we
feel
this
is
completely
inequitable
and
completely
unrelated
to
any
concerned
or
interest
of
the
government
with
relation
to
paying
out
compensation
or
past
injuries
as
to
which
there
apparently
is
never
going
to
be
a
determination
now
made
as
to
his
then
security
status.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
seems
to
be
the
government's
position,
yes.
if
we
are
currently
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
--
i
frankly
don't
know
what
the
standard
is.
it's
not
been
spelled
out.
we
have
not
been
told
anything
more
than
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
it
could
be
well
be.
it
could
well
be
more
difficult
to
try
to
determine
whether
we
are
currently
eligible
in
light
of
what
happened
to
all
15,
20
years
ago
or
it
may
be
easier.
it
would
depend
upon
the
particular
circumstances
and
the
--
the
standards
which
the
board
might
have
in
mind.
mr.
eugene
gressman
the
cut
off
date
if
under
our
theory
of
the
case
would
probably
be.
and
again
and
as
i
say,
i
have
not
made
affirm
position
on
this
because
the
case
had
not
proceeded
far
enough
for
the
court
of
claims
to
do
so.
but
if
we're
right
that
there
was
any
determination
of
a
judicial
nature,
which
was
favorable
to
the
petitioner,
that
certainly
was
made
either
in
june
of
1959
by
this
court
or
by
the
expunging
order
of
the
district
court
in
the
december
of
1959.
now,
whether
there
was
be
a
judicially
found
to
be
any
extension
of
that
period,
i'm
not
certain
but
that
is
a
litigable.
but
i
--
i
presently
think
that
that
is
probably
the
cut
off
date
when
there
was
a
final
determination
made.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
left
it
open
your
honor.
i
frankly
didn't
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
think
that
was
the
claim
--
the
amount
that
we
estimated
or
calculate
up
the
time
of
filing
the
petition
in
the
court
of
claims.
we
had
submitted
an
earlier
figure
as
we
were
asked
to
do
to
the
department
of
defense
up
to
the
point
of
that
request.
but
we
were
never
been
ask
to
fixed
--
or
to
the
precise
cut
off
date
and
of
course
that
has
not
been
resolved
or
even
argued
yet.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
that
is
true.
i
think
i
left
it
open
to
the
date
of
judgment,
but
i'm
not
committed.
mr.
eugene
gressman
by
any
procedures
you
say?
mr.
eugene
gressman
at
the
present
time?
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
those
were
the
only
procedures
then
in
effect
in
1955
procedures
which
this
court
held
were
unauthorized
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
it
would
depend
on
the
--
the
degree
of
confrontation
or
cross-examination
that
they
might
have
supplied
during
those
years
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
presumably
so
if
--
if
they
had
given
--
under
the
circumstances
of
a
given
case,
they
would
have
been
produced
the
adverse
witness
and
allowed
him
to
be
cross
examined,
i
suppose
no
claim
could
have
been
made
as
it
was
made
by
mr.
greene
in
the
prior
proceeding
in
this
court.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
don't
know
is
it
--
as
it
was
specified
precisely
in
--
in
the
regulations
at
that
time
which
lead
to
this
court's
ruling
as
to
the
unauthorized
nature
of
that
--
of
these
particular
proceedings.
but
there
is
certainly
nothing
that
would
be
preclude
them
if
--
even
if
there
were
something
in
the
regulations,
since
going
beyond
them
and
producing
the
witnesses,
and
allowing
them
to
cross
examine
thereby
cutting
off
any
conceivable
claim
that
there
was
a
denial
of
confrontation
or
cross
examination.
now,
i
would
like
you
to
refer
very
briefly
to
--
well,
mr.
justice
goldberg
asked
about
the
opinion
in
the
silver
case
and
to
say
that
in
my
judgment,
it
--
it
fully
supports
the
interpretation,
the
result
which
we
are
seeking
in
this
case.
because
the
footnote
in
that
case,
footnote
18,
specifically
refers
to
the
general
principle
of
interpretation
of
statute
to
regulations
or
what
have
you,
not
a
constitutional
principle
but
a
general
principle
that
the
--
according
of
their
procedures
is
a
fundamental
significance
and
that
series
an
irreversible
economic
injury
may
result
from
their
denial,
and
that
a
substantive
inquiry
after
the
fact
cannot
possibly
succeed
inaccurately
ascertaining
retrospective
what
the
outcome,
one
of
them
had
procedural
safeguards
been
afforded
in
the
first
instance.
it
seems
to
me
that
is,
is
this
case
in
a
nutshell
and
that
we
earnestly
urge
this
court
to
read,
to
resolve
paragraph
26
once
and
for
all
so
that
this
litigation
which
had
been
going
on
now
and
one
form
or
another
or
nearly
12,
13
years
and
finally
come
to
an
end
so
that
this
petitioner
can
be
made
whole
for
the
economic
injury
which
had
admittedly
been
inflicted
upon
mr.
greene.
thank
you.
