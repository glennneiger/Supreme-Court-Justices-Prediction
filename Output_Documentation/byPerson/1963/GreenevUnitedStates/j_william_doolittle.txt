mr.
j.
william
doolittle
mr.
chief
justice.
we
believe
that
the
central
position
--
central
question
in
this
case
is,
whether
it
was
within
the
court
of
claims'
discretion
to
order
the
suspension
of
this
proceeding
in
order
for
petitioner
to
pursue
his
administrative
remedy
before
the
department
of
defense.
now,
our
--
our
basic
position
as
it's
quite
clear
in
our
brief
is
that
not
only
was
it
proper
for
the
court
to
do
so
but
that
this
is
a
classic
case
in
which
it
should
undertake
that
procedure
where
there
is
an
adequate
administrative
remedy
available
to
the
petitioner.
it
is
capable
of
providing
complete
relief
to
him
and
the
constitutional
questions
can
thereby
be
avoided.
now,
in
--
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
on
whether
or
not
this
is
a
jurisdictional
problem
or
one
of
exhaustion,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
can,
in
essence,
regard
the
court
of
claims
as
having
done
is
that
they
determine
the
question
that
petitioner
now,
which
is
to
litigate
favorably
to
the
government,
that
is,
that
it
read
the
regulation
as
we
read
the
regulation
and
that
it
--
then
send
it
to
the
pentagon
for
action
accordingly.
and
of
course,
if
--
if
that
is
wrong
that
that
question
can
always
be
litigated
although
it
may
not
have
to
be
litigated
if
complete
restitution
is
given
by
the
pentagon
which
--
which
is
still
a
possibility.
now,
i
think
it's
important
for
us
first
to
take
a
very
careful
look
at
the
administrative
remedy
that
we
believe
is
applicable
and
that
is,
as
petitioner
points
out
paragraph
26
of
the
1955
regulation,
the
essence
of
that
paragraph
is
contained
in
its
first
sense.
in
cases
where
a
final
determination
is
favorable
to
a
contractor
employee,
the
department
whose
activity
originally
forwarded
the
case
to
the
director,
and
that's
the
director
of
the
office
of
personnel
security,
will
reimburse
the
contractor
employee
in
an
equitable
amount
for
any
loss
of
earnings
during
the
interim
resulting
directly
from
a
suspension
of
clearance.
now,
of
course,
the
1955
regulation
has
been
superseded
by
the
1960
regulation,
which
was
promulgated
as
the
result
of
this
court's
1959
decision
in
greene
against
mcelroy.
however,
because
petitioner
did
apply
for
restitution
before
the
1960
regulation
went
into
effect
and
because
the
1955
procedure
regulation
does
provide
an
easier
standard
for
peti
--
for
petitioner
to
meet,
the
department
of
defense
has
agreed
to
process
petitioner's
claim
under
paragraph
26
of
the
1955
regulation.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
might
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
certainly
true.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i'll
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i'll
go
into
that
in
quite
a
bit
of
detail
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
--
your
honor,
just
a
moment.
i
might
advert
just
for
a
moment
to
a
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
white
and
that
is
the
effects
of
the
department's
letter
concerning
paragraph
26.
now,
i
agree
with
mr.
gressman
that
that
did
not
constitute
a
determination
on
the
merits.
either
on
the
merits
of
he's
entitled
to
a
clearance
or
his
--
his
ultimate
entitlement
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
my
--
my
only
point
as
far
as
--
as
his
--
his
claim
under
paragraph
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
the
reason
that
--
the
reason
that
he
was
told
that
he
did
not
qualify
under
paragraph
26
is
that
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
--
is
that
he
had
not
submitted
to
the
procedure
required
by
section
--
by
paragraph
26
and
i
will
explain
why
--
why
we
believe
that
there
is
something
that
he
has
to
do
in
essence
what
he
was
told
that
--
that
your
claim
is
premature,
that
there's
something
that
you
have
to
do
before
you're
entitled
to
--
to
--
and
before
you're
eligible
to
restitution
under
paragraph
26.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
right.
now,
as
i
shall
spell
out
in
more
detail,
we
think
it
is
clear
that
the
final
favorable
determination
referred
to
in
paragraph
26
is
a
determination
that
the
individual
is
eligible
for
access
to
classified
defense
information
and
that
such
a
determination
can
be
arrive
at
only
by
the
department
of
defense.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
if
the
court
determined
that
it
was
wrong
on
the
merits,
that
is
to
say
if
the
court
took
it
upon
itself
to
rule
that
petitioner
was
entitled
to
a
clearance,
i
--
i
couldn't
argue
that
that
wasn't
exactly
what
the
regulation
called
for.
but
i
don't
believe
the
court
would
do
that
and
it's
clear
that
the
court
never
has
done
that.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
he
--
the
court
did
hold
that
the
revocation
of
his
clearance
was
unauthorized,
that'
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
we
--
i'll
--
i'll
go
into
this
again
a
little
more
detail.
but
we
--
we
do
not
believe
that
that
was
a
holding
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
clearance.
in
fact,
mr.
justice
harlan
at
least
specifically
pointed
out
that
it
was
not.
if
i
may
--
i
may
go
on
for
just
a
moment
as
to
what
remedy
we
have
in
mind,
i
--
this
is
decidedly
preliminary
but
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
the
procedure
that
the
department
would
employ
in
arriving
at
this
final
favorable
determination
or
final
unfavorable
determination
as
the
case
maybe,
in
the
procedure
that
we
believe
that
mr.
greene
must
go
through,
would
apply
the
more
liberal
procedures
of
the
1960
regulation
which
was
issued
under
the
authority
of
the
president.
now,
provision
is
made
in
that
regulation,
the
1960
regulation,
for
a
proceeding
in
which
the
individual
has
rights
of
confrontation
and
cross-examination
and
in
which
the
use
of
information
that
cannot
be
disclosed
to
him
for
national
security
reasons
is
very
sharply
and
very
closely
restricted.
thus,
petitioner
is
being
offered
the
best
of
both
regulations,
the
easier
standard
for
restitution
of
the
1955
regulation
and
the
more
liberal
procedures
of
the
1960
regulation.
however,
petitioner
refuses
to
proceed
in
the
department
of
defense
under
either
regulation
or
any
combination
of
the
two.
and
the
central
contention
is
that
he
has
already
satisfied
the
requirements
of
paragraph
26
and
that
it
is
therefore
unnecessary
to
remit
his
case
to
the
department.
he
argues
first
that
this
court's
decision
in
greene
against
mcelroy,
coupled
with
the
order
of
judge
keech
on
remand
constituted
a
final
favorable
determination
for
purposes
of
paragraph
26.
now,
the
fundamental
defect
in
this
argument,
as
we
see
it,
is
that
the
final
favorable
determination
contemplated
by
paragraph
26
is
a
determination
that
the
individual
is
eligible
to
access
to
classified
defense
information.
now,
a
fair-minded
examination
of
the
context
of
the
regulation,
we
believe
conclusively,
conclusively
demonstrates
that
that
it
so.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes
sir,
that's
exactly
what
they
would
do.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
if
he
is
--
if
he
is
not
eligible
as
of
the
time
that
the
determination
is
made,
we
would
say
that
he
is
not
--
he
--
he
cannot
recover
under
--
under
the
restitution
provision.
now,
let
--
let
me
point
out
one
thing,
and
i
--
i
say
this
without
wanting
to
bind
department
of
--
of
defense
or
the
department
of
justice
in
its
future
action.
it's
not
altogether
clear
that
1959
would
be
the
cutoff
date
because
we
are
--
we,
in
the
department
of
justice,
are
talking
about
a
determination
yet
to
be
made
and
paragraph
26
indicates
that
that
determination
is
the
end
of
the
right
to
restitution.
now,
of
course,
it
maybe
that
other
circumstances
would
come
into
play
such
as
the
fact
that
he
--
maybe
he's
now
earning
more
than
he
was
back
in
1953
or
maybe
it
could
be
said
that
he
unreasonably
delayed
in
--
in
seeking
relief.
but
other
--
those
factors
apart,
it's
not
obvious
to
me
at
any
rate
that
that
--
that
the
cutoff
date
has
yet
arrived
such
that
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
a
determination
in
1964,
let
us
say,
of
his
situation
back
in
1959.
it
would
--
it
would
be
currently
relevant.
now,
i
will
--
mr.
justice
touch
on
your
point
with
respect
to
silver
in
--
in
a
few
moments.
as
i
say,
we
believe
that
the
context
of
the
regulation
at
the
very
least
requires
the
reading
that
we
have
indicated.
the
opening
sentence
of
the
entire
regulation
of
which
section
--
of
which
paragraph
26
is
a
part,
makes
it
clear
what
kind
of
determination
the
regulation
is
talking
about.
that
sentence
is
this,
"this
part
describes
the
uniform
standard
in
criteria
for
determining
the
eligibility
of
contractors,
contractor
employees
and
certain
other
individuals,
as
set
forth
in
this
part,
to
have
access
to
classify
defense
information."
and
thereon
--
from
thereon,
it
sets
forth
detailed
procedures
by
which
determinations
are
to
be
reached
and
that
each
level,
the
screening
board
level,
hearing
board
level
and
finally
the
review
board
level,
the
regulation
clearly
sets
forth
the
kind
of
determination
of
access
eligibility
that
is
to
be
involved.
significantly,
the
regulation
makes
the
review
board's
determination
final
subject
only
to
reconsideration
by
the
review
board
itself,
by
the
secretary
of
defense
or
by
the
three
service
secretaries
jointly.
thus,
it
was
not
contemplated
that
there
would
be
any
judicial
review
of
this
finding
of
access
eligibility
such
that
the
only
final
favorable
determination
that
the
drafters
of
the
regulation
could
possibly
have
had
in
mind
was
an
administrative
determination
of
access
eligibility.
now,
further
confirmation
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
the
secretary
of
the
navy
in
a
sense
preferred
charges
and
then
it
preceded
through
these
various
boards
or
the
--
the
equivalence
of
them
under
a
prior
regulation.
but
the
final
determination
that
was
set
aside
eventually
by
this
court
or
actually
by
judge
keech's
order
was
a
review
board
determination.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
we
believe
that
there
are,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
now,
i'll
touch
upon
that
in
just
a
moment.
but
--
well,
if
--
if
--
what
they
are?
they
--
they
are
the
charges
that
are
set
forth
in
this
court's
opinion
in
--
in
considerable
detail,
one
lengthy
footnote.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
these
charges
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
these
charges,
your
honor,
we
--
we
certainly
don't
believe
that
these
charges
have
been
wiped
out.
the
--
the
final
revocation
of
his
clearance
was
wiped
out.
but
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
with
the
charges
and
no
order
has
ever
said
anything
about
those
charges.
in
short,
we
don't
feel
that
mr.
greene
is
now
entitled
to
a
clearance
just
because
he
had
that
1952
ruling
that
he
was
subsequently
charged
for
a
cause.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
right.
now,
that
wiped
out
a
final
revocation
and
i
have
no
doubt
at
all
that
mr.
greene,
if
he
wish
to
contest
these
charges,
could
have
them
process
through
the
authorized
procedures
and
perhaps
they
would
come
out
with
a
--
with
a
final
favorable
determination.
but
the
fact
is
that
on
the
books
now
are
those
charges
which
no
court
decision
has
ever
touched.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes,
i
would
say
so
your
honor
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
--
because
they
--
they
just
haven't
been
pressed
to
a
conclusion
which
it
is
his
and
has
been
his
privilege
to
do
it
anytime
but
because
the
--
because
the
subsequent
determinations
have
been
wiped
out,
as
they
clearly
have
been
by
this
court's
decision
in
--
in
judge
keech's
order
on
remand,
in
a
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
if
the
regulation
is
still
read
the
way
it
does
now
under
either
1955
or
1960
regulations,
he
has
to
be
with
you.
now,
we
believe
that
further
on
very
strong
confirmation
that
restitution
under
the
--
under
paragraph
26
is
to
be
based
on
a
clearance
determination
that
comes
from
this
court's
decision
in
greene
against
mcelroy.
there,
this
court,
as
counsel
has
pointed
out
in
its
brief,
discussed
paragraph
26
and
it
described
paragraph
26
in
the
following
terms.
a
program
under
which
reimbursement
for
lost
wages
would
be
made
to
employees
of
government
contractors
who
were
temporarily
denied
but
later
granted
security
clearance.
and
in
taylor
against
mcelroy
which
petitioner
makes
so
much
as
demonstrating
that
this
court
was
aware
of
paragraph
26,
the
court's
--
the
court's
opinion
makes
it
very
clear
that
taylor
had
received
a
final
favorable
determination
of
his
clearance
eligibility
by
the
administrative
authorities
which
of
course
was
the
reason
why
paragraph
26
was
applicable.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
pardon?
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
the
department
of
defense
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
the
department
of
defense
had
--
had
a
rule
that
he
was
entitled
to
access
authorization.
that's
at
page
710
of
360
u.s.,
the
court
sets
forth
those
facts.
finally,
it
has
been
the
consistent
position
of
the
department
of
defense
in
implementing
the
1955
regulation
that
the
final
favorable
determination
of
paragraph
26
is
a
determination
of
clearance
eligibility
in
this
consistent
and
long-standing
interpretation
of
a
regulation
by
the
agency
responsible
for
its
drafting
as
we
submit
entitled
to
great
way.
now,
petitioner
contends
however,
that
he
should
not
be
--
that
he
should
be
accepted
from
the
necessity
of
a
determination
of
clearance
eligibility
because
he
does
not
need
a
clearance
in
his
present
work.
one
cannot
help
wondering
whether
that
circumstance
should
justify
according
petitioner
preferential
treatment
over
other
whose
cases
have
been
processed
under
paragraph
26.
more
than
that
however,
we
feel
that
there
is
a
perfectly
valid
reason
for
the
department's
insisting
on
a
determination
of
clearance
eligibility
as
a
condition
precedent
to
a
restitution
for
the
suspension
or
revocation
of
a
clearance.
suppose
that
because
of
activities
or
associations,
the
individual
would
under
no
circumstance,
have
been
judged
under
any
kind
of
procedure,
reasonable
or
otherwise,
would
have
been
deemed
and
titled
to
a
security
clearance.
suppose,
for
example,
that
he
was
an
admitted
espionage
agent
for
a
foreign
power,
how
has
he
been
hurt
by
the
unauthorized
suspension
or
revocation
of
his
clearance?
he
was
never
entitled
to
a
clearance.
he
never
could
have
gotten
one
under
any
kind
of
procedure.
he
has
not
been
hurt.
the
purpose
of
this
requirement
is
simply
to
--
to
determine
whether
the
individual
was
actually
injured
by
the
act
complained
of,
whether
he
was
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
--
actually
entitled
to
a
clearance.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
i
may
say
that
that
--
that
is
certainly
one
of
the
factors
that
would
have
to
be
taken
into
account
in
arriving
at
the
determination.
and
i
should
suppose
that
if
he
contended
import
that
that
was
the
facts
and
it
was
clear
that
the
department
of
defense
had
not
taken
adequate
account
of
that
fact,
that
would
certainly
be
a
ground
for
reversal
of
the
administrative
determination.
i
don't
doubt
that
for
a
moment.
now,
you've
asked,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
about
what
you've
said
in
the
silver
case.
there
really
are
two
important
distinctions
between
the
situation
there
and
the
situation
here.
first,
of
course,
we're
talking
about
a
determination
of
present
eligibility
at
least
under
the
1955
regulation
or
the
1960
regulation,
does
require
not
only
a
finding
of
present
eligibility
but
a
finding
that
the
revocation
was
unjustified,
which
we
take
to
be
a
finding
of
past
eligibility
in
effect.
but
not
so
under
the
1955
regulation
and
that
is
the
one
we're
applying
here.
therefore,
some
of
the
considerations
that
you
adverted
to
there,
do
not
seem
to
us
to
be
present
and
we
do
feel
that
--
that
a
--
a
determination
now
is
really
very
different
from
a
determination
then.
if
for
--
it
--
there
--
it
may
have
been
that
--
that
there
were
circumstances
that
would've
substantively
justified
the
denial
of
a
clearance
back,
say
in
1952
or
1953,
but
if
it
appears
that
the
individual
involved
has
--
has
done
nothing
of
this
general
character
in
--
in
the
meantime,
thus,
adding
some
--
some
kind
of
color
to
the
--
to
the
prior
activities,
this
is
certainly
a
fact
that
would
have
to
be
taken
into
account
in
a
--
in
a
present
adjudication.
the
same
standards
just
--
just
don't
apply
when
there's
a
significant
difference
in
time
of
course.
now,
secondly,
and
really
i
think
critically
as
far
as
what
you've
said
in
silver
is
concerned,
i
assume
from
reading
what
you
said
that
that
was
a
--
a
construction
of
the
legislation
that
was
before
the
court
at
that
time.
and
what
we
have
here
is
a
regulation
that
in
or
judgment
as
clearly
as
a
regulation
could
set
forth
the
fact
that
this
kind
of
determination
is
to
be
made
and
unless
if
it
said
that
what
you've
said
in
silver
is
a
constitutional
requirement,
we
believe
that
the
plain
language
of
the
regulation
must
control.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
realize
that.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
right.
given
the
fact
that
the
final
favorable
determination
referred
--
referred
to
in
paragraph
26
is
a
determination
of
eligibility
for
clearance
and
that
seems
indisputable
to
us.
it
follows
that
that
determination
is
one
that
only
the
department
of
defense
can
make.
certainly,
this
court
in
greene
against
mcelroy
did
not
purport
to
determine
that
petitioner
was
entitled
to
a
clearance
as
i
pointed
out,
mr.
justice
harlan
in
his
concurring
opinion
was
it
taints
to
emphasize
that
and
i
quote,
"there
is
nothing
in
the
court's
opinion
which
suggest
the
petitioner
must
be
given
access
to
classify
the
material.
nor
is
there
any
intimation
in
judge
keech's
order
on
remand
that
he
intended
to
declare
petitioner's
entitlement
to
a
clearance."
and
as
i
have
said,
the
regulation
itself
clearly
contemplates
that
the
determination
will
be
made
by
an
administrative
board
or
official.
the
short
of
our
argument
is
that
it
is
clear
beyond
doubt
that
the
final
favorable
determination
of
paragraph
26
is
a
determination
of
clearance
eligibility
that
can
be
passed
on
only
by
the
department
of
defense.
by
ceasing
final
favorable
determination
and
taking
it
entirely
out
of
context,
petitioner
has
been
able
to
make
this
argument
which
is
in
essence
that
any
final
favorable
determination
that
he
lay
his
hands
on
will
do.
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
in
relation
to
this
regulation,
the
final
favorable
determination
of
this
court
and
of
judge
keech
on
remand
is
--
is
no
more
relevant
than
any
other
determination
that
petitioner
might
be
able
to
find.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
we
do.
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
the
--
the
relevance
of
the
1960
regulation
is,
as
i
say,
it
means,
if
the
regulation
is
now
in
effect,
1955
regulation
strictly
speaking
is
no
longer
in
effect.
and
we
believe
that
petitioner
is
entitled
with
more
liberal
procedures
under
the
1960
regulation.
we
would
or
we
couldn't
--
we
couldn't
process
his
claim
under
the
1955
regulation
or
we'd
be
right
back
in
this
court
because
the
1955
regulation
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
--
has
procedures
that
were
held
to
be
unauthorized
but
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i
agree,
your
honor.
now
i
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
mr.
--
mr.
gressman
has
argued
that,
the
way
he
put
it
the
first
time
was
that,
some
of
the
language
used
in
the
1960
regulation
was
to
plug
a
loophole
and
they
said
that
there
must
have
been
an
intention
to
change.
but
we
don't
think
that's
all
true.
the
1960
regulation
much
more
clearly
expresses
what
was
in
--
in
the
minds
of
the
drafters
of
the
1955
regulation.
but
beyond
that,
i
--
i
can't
disagree
with
you,
the
1960
regulation
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
completely
right,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
the
1955
regulation
is
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
--
it
has
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
--
it
has
sort
of
existence
and
it
has
enough
existence
that
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes,
we
--
we
don't
assume
the
nine
--
that
--
that
paragraph
26
is
invalid
as
result
of
this
court's
decision.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
exactly,
your
honor.
and
as
i
say,
it's
--
it's
beyond
question,
a
more
liberal
procedure.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
i'm
sorry;
i
don't
understand
your
question.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
the
final
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
the
final
determination
that
we
think
is
critical
under
paragraph
26
would
be
a
determination
made
if
and
when
petitioner
submits
himself
to
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
as
of
the
date
on
which
it's
made.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
not
today.
the
day
on
which
it
was
made,
that's
right.
some
time
in
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
1960
regulation.
the
1960
regulation
would
require
both
a
finding
of
present
eligibility
present
as
of
the
time
it's
made
and
a
finding
which
we
consider
to
be
the
rough
equivalent
of
that,
as
of
the
time
the
clearance
was
revoked.
in
other
words
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
--
as
i
say
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no.
our
--
our
construction
of
that
is,
whether
or
not
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
a
clearance
--
judged
under
a
reasonable
procedure,
under
an
authorized
fully
legal
procedure.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no,
1955
regulation
is
concerned.
we
submit,
only
with
present
eligibility,
eligibility
as
of
the
time
the
proceeding
for
restitution
takes
place.
that's
the
only
finding
that
is
required.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
the
right
of
confrontation
and
cross-examination,
that's
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
it
is.
i
--
i
would
point
out
that
this
is
rather
the
exceptional
case
and
i
think
i
would
also
point
out
that
to
the
extent
that
it
is
difficult
or
impossible
to
make
an
accurate
determination
under
the
1960
regulation
certainly,
the
individual
ought
to
be
given
some
benefit
of
the
doubt.
finally,
i
would
point
out
that
that
isn't
what
is
before
the
case
here
the
court
hears.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
you're
--
you
are
assuming,
mr.
justice
that
if
he
goes
back
to
the
department
of
defense
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
--
assuming
that
he
found
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
--
presently
ineligible
for
a
clearance
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
--
which
i
don't
assume
nor
--
nor
do
the
officials
of
the
department
of
defense.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
once
in
1952
and
once
in
1953,
i
think.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
if
i
may
say,
we
--
we
don't
really
look
upon
it
as
--
as
a
matter
of
purification.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
right,
your
honor,
although
i
would
point
out
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
mr.
justice
black,
if
i
may
point
out,
the
claim
is
for
restitution
starting
then
and
continuing
until
now.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
he
is
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
--
he
still
say
--
he's
still
saying,
"i'm
still
being
hurt",
right
up
until
the
day
that
he
asked
for
restitution.
so
his
clearability
as
of
that
date
is
highly
relevant
because
he's
saying,
"i'm
still
being
hurt.
i'm
still
earning
less
than
i
did
before."
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
the
regulation
so
provided.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no,
your
honor,
it
isn't.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
petitioner
alternatively
argues
that
the
effect
of
judge
keech's
order
on
remand
expunging
the
final
revocation
of
its
clearance
from
the
records,
leaves
a
prior
favorable
administrative
determination
in
effect,
namely
that
of
january
29,
1952.
this
ingenious
argument
which
does
have
the
virtue
of
recognizing
that
a
final
--
that
the
final
paper
for
determination
must
be
in
administrative
one,
is
we
think
entirely
without
substance.
for
one
thing,
if
what
petitioner
says
is
true,
there
would
be
outstanding,
the
subsequent
unresolved
charges
or
the
statement
of
reasons
which
is
set
forth
at
pages
484
to
486
of
this
court's
opinion.
more
importantly,
however,
in
no
sense
may
judge
keech's
order
be
read
as
reinstating
the
clearance
of
petitioner
that
was
revoked
from
such
--
such
an
argument,
it
would
follow
that
the
petitioners
is
now
entitled
to
access
the
classified
information
which
he
obviously
is
not,
and
judge
keech
plainly
never
intended
such
a
result.
i
might
note
one
other
incongruity
that
would
result
from
this
argument.
it
is
clear
from
paragraph
26
that
it
is
the
final
favorable
determination
that
closes
the
interim
period
for
which
an
individual
is
entitle
to
restitution.
thus,
if
the
1952
determination
marks
the
end
of
this
interim,
petitioner
would
be
entitled
to
compensation
at
most
for
the
two
months
that
he
was
suspended
and
which
suspension
was
terminated
by
the
favorable
determination
in
1952.
in
some,
the
remedy
of
paragraph
26
in
which
the
petitioner
suit
is
in
part
at
least
based,
is
in
administrative
remedy
and
it
must
be
pursued
in
the
department
of
defense
before
petitioner
has
any
right
to
recover
under
it.
now,
i
shall,
as
petitioner
does,
leave
to
the
brief
the
discussion
of
the
constitutional
questions
unless
this
court
has
any
question
that
wishes
to
ask.
