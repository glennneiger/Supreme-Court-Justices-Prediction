justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand.
i
--
i
think
i
must
misunderstand
you.
do
i
understand
that
this
man
was
discharged
in
1950
and
now
declared
in
1952?
justice
hugo
l.
black
once
in
1952
and
once
in
1953.
and
he
wanted
--
he
wants
to
get
money
because
it
was
wrong
for
him
--
for
him
to
be
discharged,
loose
his
job
because
of
that
lack
of
clearance.
do
i
understand
that?
i
think
i
must
not.
you're
saying
that
if
they
now
have
a
hearing
in
1963
and
determined
that
as
of
today,
he
could
not
be
given
a
clearance.
nevertheless,
that
would
somehow
purify
the
--
one
in
1952
and
1953
so
that
he
could
not
recover
any
--
get
into
restitution
even
though
1952
or
1953,
he
could've
--
that
he
was
wrong,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
i'll
forget
the
purification.
do
i
understand
that
you
are
saying
that
whether
it
was
right
or
wrong
to
do
this
in
1952
and
1953,
do
you
think
you
have
it
here
in
1963
or
find
out
in
some
way
that
in
the
intervening
years,
he
has
become
somehow
wrong,
so
evil
that
he
shouldn't
have
a
clearance.
if
that
would
be
enough
to
answer
so
that
he
could
not
recover
for
the
wrongful
clearance
that
was
damaging
or
--
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
correct?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
--
that
the
government
is
taking
the
position
that
if
it
will
--
wants
to
decline
the
pay
him
in
back
wages
restitution
because
if
--
it
wants
a
chance
to
find
out
13
years
after
something
happened
that
at
this
time,
he
--
he
couldn't
get
a
clearance
from
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
done
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
all
the
restitution
in
that
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
alright,
let's
forget
of
today
and
next
week
and
next
month.
you
might
say
that
he's
still
--
that
he
can't
get
any
damages
from
that?
are
you
saying
that
he
can't
get
restitution
for
damages
he
has
actually
suffered
within
10
years
because
you
can
show
that
he
couldn't
get
any
damages
now
if
they
discharge
him
--
examine
the
clearance
since
he
couldn't
get
the
clearance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
--
and
that's
what
you're
defending.
