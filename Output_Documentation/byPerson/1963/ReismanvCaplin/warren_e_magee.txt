mr.
warren
e.
magee
mr.
chief
justice
and
mr.
associate
justices,
your
honor
i
represent
the
petitioners
in
this
particular
case
who
are
practitioners
of
law.
mr.
reisman
is
an
attorney
practicing
law
in
los
angeles,
california.
the
other
plaintiffs
in
the
suit
below
who
are
petitioners
here
are
attorneys
practicing
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
who
specialize
in
the
income
tax
and
other
tax
fields
and
have
practices
outside
of
the
district
of
columbia.
the
situation
involved
in
this
case
rose
in
this
fashion.
two
taxpayers
by
the
name
of
bromley
were
having
tax
problems
with
the
bureau.
as
a
result
of
certain
negotiations
and
actions,
deficiency
assessments
in
the
sum
of
several
million
dollars
had
been
issued
by
the
bureau.
ultimately,
these
assessments
ended
up
in
four
cases
to
be
adjudicated
in
the
tax
court.
at
or
about
the
time
these
cases
were
pending
in
the
tax
court,
the
firm
in
california
los
angeles
retained
the
washington
firm
to
assist
them
in
the
defense
of
these
tax
cases
and
for
any
possible
criminal
litigation,
if
that
ever
arouse
out
of
the
so
called
tax
delinquencies.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
the
taxpayers
at
that
time
are
residents
of
honolulu
your
honor
and
had
as
the
subpoena
show,
had
activities
which
extended
throughout
the
world,
according
to
the
face
of
the
subpoenas.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
it
has
been
tried
and
we
so
stated
in
our
brief
your
honor
and
it
is
now
under
consideration
by
the
tax
court,
but
the
decision
has
not
yet
been
rendered
in
any
of
the
four
cases.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
yes
sir
but
not
to
the
tax
court,
because
those
cases
had
been
tried,
but
it
is
relevant
because
the
commissioner
has
stated
he
is
going
ahead
with
these
subpoenas
anyway
because
there
is
a
pending
criminal
investigation
open
in
these
cases,
that's
why
it
is
not
moot
your
honor,
this
is
the
dangerous
aspect
of
it.
now,
here
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
the
taxpayers
endeavored
to
work
out
a
settlement
with
the
representatives
of
the
respondent.
tentative
arrangements
were
made
under
which
peat,
marwick,
and
mitchell,
a
vast
accounting
firm
with
offices
throughout
the
world
and
throughout
the
united
states
were
retained
by
trammell,
rand,
and
nathan,
and
by
reisman
to
aid
them
in
preparing
the
defenses
to
the
tax
cases
at
any
possible
criminal
implications
that
might
be
involved.
discussions
were
entered
into
with
the
bureau
and
it
was
tentatively
agreed
that
the
various
documents
and
papers
which
trammell,
rand,
and
reisman
firm
returned
over
to
peat,
marwick,
and
mitchell
for
accounting
purposes
would
be
a
sample,
worksheets
would
be
prepared
and
a
certain
disclosure
would
be
made
for
settlement
purposes
with
the
bureau.
only
assurance
that
there
was
no
criminal
investigation
pending.
negotiations
to
this
end
went
on
and
at
a
late
conference
just
before
counsel
were
about
to
turn
over
their
work
products
to
the
bureau,
the
bureau
then
notified
that
there
was
an
open
criminal
case
after
the
so
called
bailment
had
been
made
between
counsel
and
their
accountants.
you
must
always
bear
in
mind
your
honor
that
these
accountants
never
worked
for
the
taxpayers.
they
were
retained
by
counsel
just
as
they
retained
anyone
else
to
work
in
their
office,
such
a
law
clerk,
a
bookkeeper,
or
any
other
person
and
the
arrangement
which
is
alleged
in
the
compliant
is
that
it
was
agreed
that
every
piece
of
paper
that
went
to
peat,
marwick,
and
mitchell
was
to
be
isolated
in
a
file
and
designated
as
the
property
of
the
plaintiff
attorneys
and
not
the
property
of
the
accountants.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
no
he
is
not
in
the
suit
your
honor.
taxpayers
are
not
parties
to
this
litigation.
their
rights
have
been
asserted
through
their
counsel,
mr.
goldberg.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
i
shall
be
delighted
to.
i
would
like
to
get
this
factual
background
clear,
so
your
honors
will
know
about
what
we
are
discussing
today.
when
this
conference
in
the
bureau
indicated
to
counsel
for
the
bromley's
that
there
was
a
possible
criminal
investigation,
bromley
himself
went
with
his
counsel
to
the
bureau
and
then
the
bureau
told
him
that
that
they
wanted
these
papers,
but
that
they
were
going
to
use
them
against
him
possibly
in
the
civil
and
possibly
in
the
criminal
cases.
and
based
on
that
situation
mr.
bromley
stood
on
his
constitutional
rights
and
refused
to
deliver
the
papers
to
the
bureau
of
taking
the
ground
that
that
would
be
violation
of
his
rights
against
self
incrimination
when
they
were
threatening
criminal
prosecution.
he
is
perfectly
willing
to
have
them,
have
the
papers
that
all
they
wanted
them
for
was
to
use
to
settle
the
tax
cases
which
were
pending
in
the
tax
court.
so
he
had
refused
to
waive
his
rights.
the
tax
cases
were
then
set
down
for
trial
and
were
pinned
all
four
of
them.
at
or
about
that
time,
the
respondent
caplin
issued
on
the
7604
a
series
of
subpoenas
addressed
to
peat,
marwick,
and
mitchell
which
are
partnership
by
the
way
and
not
a
corporation
in
their
new
york,
chicago
and
los
angeles
offices,
asking
for
a
whole,
all
of
the
papers
which
counsel
had
turned
over
to
their
accountants
for
use
in
defending
the
tax
cases
and
for
use
in
protecting
them
against
criminal
charges.
peat,
marwick,
and
mitchell
advised
the,
being
a
firm
with
vast
operations
didn't
want
to
risk
contempt
because
what
we
face
under
these
subpoenas
if
you
don't
comply.
they
said
they
were
going
to
comply
and
were
going
to
turn
our
papers
over
to
the
bureau.
that
left
us
but
one
recourse
which
we
promptly
took.
we
went
to
the
jurisdiction
were
the
commissioner
was
located
and
where
there
was
also
an
office
of
peat,
marwick,
and
mitchell
in
washington
dc.
we
filed
a
civil
action
against
the
commissioner
to
join
the
enforcement
of
these
subpoenas
and
we
alleged
that
these
subpoenas
were
not
being
used
for
the
limited
purposes
set
forth
in
7602
and
4,
which
is
for
the
purpose
basically
of
determining
the
correctness
of
a
tax
repayment,
not
for
prosecution.
and
we
further
allege
that
these
were
the
work
products
of
counsel,
they
belong
to
counsel,
they
did
not
belong
to
peat,
marwick,
and
mitchell
and
this
was
an
unconstitutional
search
and
seizure
contrary
to
the
fourth,
fifth,
and
sixth
amendments
to
the
constitution.
there
was
no
answer
ever
filed
controverting
the
allegations
of
unconstitutional
acts
and
the
allegations
of
exceeding
his
statutory
authority
under
these
very
limited
statutes.
that
was
never
denied
and
of
course
hasn't
been
denied
to
this
attorney.
the
complaint
where
the
motion
was
sworn
to,
a
motion
for
a
temporary
restraining
order,
and
a
preliminary
injunction,
were
filed
with
a
supporting
affidavit
of
mr.
nathan,
which
supported
these
allegations
of
the
complaint,
pointing
out
there
would
be
a
turning
over
of
these
papers
which
of
course
would
destroy
the
trail
preparation
of
the
parties
by
the
voluntary
act
of
peat,
marwick,
and
mitchell.
the
matter
came
on
for
ex
parte
hearing
before
judge
curran
in
our
district
court
he
granted,
yes
sir
--
mr.
warren
e.
magee
yes
sir.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
they
–
we
don't
--
we
don't
quite
read
it
that
way
and
neither
of
the
courts
below
have
read
it
that
way.
the
court
below
read
that
quite
different
from
that
and
so
did
the
government.
they
took
the
position,
now
the
court
in
its
opinion
which
appears
in
the
record,
may
it
please
the
court,
just
one
moment
is
this
and
i
read
from
page
157
of
the
record
your
honors
from
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
the
essence
of
the
complaint
is
that
the
summons
called
for
the
production
of
privilege
matter
including
the
work
product
of
the
counsel
and
were
not
issued
for
the
purpose
of
assessing
taxes
or
of
ascertaining
the
correctness
of
any
return,
but
to
obtain
evidence
for
use
in
pending
tax
cases
or
to
prosecute
taxpayers
criminally.
the
defendants,
reading
now
from
158
your
honors
of
the
record,
the
second
sentence
in
that
top
paragraph,
the
defendants
harney
and
macclure
as
representatives
of
the
accounting
firm
answered,
admitting
the
essential
allegations
of
the
complaint
and
joined
in
its
prayers
for
relief
which
included
a
prayer
that
some
of
it
be
quashed.
we
have
always
read
this
answer
and
the
court
below
has
always
read
it
as
an
admission
of
all
the
material
facts
in
the
complaint,
and
the
case
has
been
argued
on
that
basis,
and
of
course
that
supplies
all
the
parties
involved
in
this
litigation
and
places
them
before
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
assuming
our
position
that
the
plaintiffs
as
petitioners,
as
counsel
for
the
taxpayers
got
to
assert
their
constitutional
rights.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
yes
sir.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
precisely.
that
wasn't
saying
they
still
wouldn't
apply.
they
wanted
themselves
enjoined,
that's
what
they
really
wanted
so
they
wouldn't
have
to
turn
our
papers
over
to
the
department.
they
could
see
that
that
wasn't
correct
and
they
admitted
in
their
answer
that
the
papers
belonged
to
us,
the
attorneys.
so
we
have
no
issue
on
ownership.
now
the
government
instead
of
answering,
may
it
please
the
court,
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
their
motion
didn't
raise
this
question
which
is
now
one
of
the
questions
which
is
now
before
this
court
of
sovereign
immunity
at
all.
they
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
very
limited
grounds
that
the
plaintiffs
did
not
have
status
to
sue
and
that
the
complaint
failed
to
state
a
cause
of
action
this
is
what
they
urged
to
the
district
court
and
their
motion
appears,
i
just
can't
put
the
finger
on
it,
but
i'll
find
it
for
your
honor
and
instead
of
--
mr.
warren
e.
magee
that's
on
page
71
of
the
record.
i
have
--
yes
i
have
it
here.
you
see
they
state
these.
now
these
are
the
grounds.
the
plaintiffs
have
no
standing
to
sue.
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
the
assessment
of
collection
of
a
federal
tax.
that
declaratory
relief
with
respect
of
federal
taxes
is
specifically
prohibited
by
28
u.s.c.
section
2201.
the
complaint
fails
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
then
in
order
that
there
be
no
misunderstanding
of
the
positions
which
they
took
in
the
trial
court,
we
have
printed
those
points
and
authorities
in
support
of
this
motion
and
nowhere
in
there
is
this
so
called
offence
that
this
is
a
suit
against
the
united
states
without
its
consent
raised
at
the
trial
level.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
well,
i
think
if
may
i
give
you
an
honest
answer
to
that?
solicitor
general
takes
the
position
of
this
case,
that's
a
very
difficult
question.
he
doesn't
think
he
is
supported
in
his
opposition
and
shouldn't
be
decided
by
this
court.
it
should
be
decided
on
some
other
ground.
so
i
respectively
submit
they
did
not
think
at
the
trial
level
there
was
enough
merit
to
that
contention
to
present
it
because
it
was
never
presented
or
argued,
motioned,
any
point
in
authorities
or
in
the
oral
argument
which
is
also
reported
here.
i
just
bring
that
up
because
this
came
up
only
in
the
court
of
appeals,
this
question
of
the
lack
of
consent
to
sue
the
united
states
in
this
particular
case.
the
motion
to
dismiss
was
heard
by
another
judge.
there
was
no
answer,
or
any
affidavits
contraverting
these
factual
allegations
which
i
have
detailed
to
your
honors
which
were
covered
by
the
complaint.
the
case
was
heard
on
motion
before
judge
heart.
now
judge
heart
didn't
agree
with
this
any
theory
that
the
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction.
as
he
ruled
at
page
141,
where
there
is
an
allegation
and
a
complaint
of
unconstitutional
action,
which
this
complaint
alleged,
he
is
going
off
on
another
point
your
honor
can
see.
judge
heart
said
this,
“on
the
other
hand
of
course
the
federal
court
always
has
jurisdiction
to
restrain
an
unconstitutional
exercise
of
power,”
that
is
the
position
which
he
took,
but
he
took
the
position
which
i
submit
your
honors
is
wholly
unsupported
by
the
record
because
he
found
contrary
to
the
sworn
allegations
of
the
complaint
that
these
papers
were
the
papers
of
peat,
marwick
and
mitchell.
and
if
they
hadn't
initiated
this
action,
even
though
they
were
before
the
court
we
had
no
status
to
maintain
as
attorneys
to
the
taxpayer,
that's
what
the
judge
ruled
at
the
trial
level
and
that
was
the
basis
of
his
decision
so
on
that
basis
he
dismissed
the
complaint.
we
then
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
case
was
argued
before
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
became
concerned
over
what's
going
to
happen
if
somebody
doesn't
answer
and
respond
to
one
of
these
complaints.
can
they
just
be
taken
in
ex
parte
and
held
and
judged
in
contempt
and
asked
that
be
briefed?
and
of
course
our
is
a
case
that
holds
that
you
can
do
precisely
that
just
take
the
recalcitrant
witness,
ex
parte
into
court
and
it
can
be
immediately
sentenced
for
contempt
for
failure
to
answer
such
a
subpoena.
but
and
the
case
was
argued
at
length
and
brief
and
re-briefed
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
on
february
7th
entered
its
opinion.
now
the
court
of
appeals
states
the
facts
just
as
i
have
given
them
to
your
honors
here
in
the
first
two
pages
of
its
opinion
and
boils
down
the
real
allegations
which
are
admitted
in
this
complaint,
in
this
language
at
157
i
mentioned
this
to
you
before,
the
essence
of
the
complaint
is
that
the
summons
called
for
the
production
of
privilege
matter,
including
the
work
product
of
counsel
and
were
not
issued
for
the
purpose
of
assessing
taxes
or
ascertaining
the
correctness
of
any
return,
but
to
obtain
evidence
for
use
in
pending
facts
cases
or
to
prosecute
the
taxpayers
criminally.
then
the
court
says
that
the
district
court
had
denied
--
granted
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
entered
findings,
which
i
have
described
to
your
honor,
but
judge
fahy
of
the
court
of
appeals
disregards
those
findings
and
says
that
that
court
is
going
to
decide
this
case
on
an
entirely
different
ground
and
here
is
what
judge
fahy
said,
“we
think
the
complaint
was
properly
dismissed,
but
for
a
different
reason
namely,
that
it
is
not
within
the
court's
jurisdiction
because
it
is
in
substance
a
suit
against
the
united
states
to
which
it
has
not
consented.”
and
as
a
basis
for
this
contention
and
finding
the
court
cites
larson,
malone,
united
states
versus
lee,
the
dollar
case,
larson
again
and
the
wells,
and
the
louisiana
cases.
so
this
is
the
basis
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
decided,
which
is
completely
different
from
the
court
below,
but
we
now
have
a
situation
where
it
is
admitted,
that
you
would
have
two
things.
you
have
property
of
attorneys
which
is
their
work
product
and
which
we
contend
is
privileged,
being
sought
by
revenue
subpoena
while
still
in
the
constructive
possession
of
the
attorneys
because
their
accountants
just
like
their
law
clerks
are
maintaining
these
papers
for
them
and
working
over
them
in
file
preparations,
in
defense
of
civil
and
criminal
cases
too.
we
have
respondent
caplin
using
a
revenue
subpoena
and
if
your
honors
read
the
section
you'll
find
it's
only
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
correctness
of
taxes
and
collecting
them.
just
bear
in
mind
that
mr.
caplin
has
two
sections
in
his
department.
he
has
got
a
police
section
which
is
run
by
the
special
agents
and
he
has
got
a
tax
collection
section
which
is
run
by
the
tax
collectors.
and
i
respectively
submit
that
congress
never
intended
to
turn
7604
over
to
the
police
section
or
the
treasury
department
to
obtain
evidence
to
be
used
in
either
a
civil
tax
case
or
in
criminal
prosecutions.
there
is
nothing
in
the
history
that
shows
that
was
ever
intended.
this
is
a
section
dealing
only
with
determining
the
correctness
of
taxes
and
collecting
them
and
so
with
--
and
further
that
when
he
does
this
and
uses
the
guides
of
subpoena
to
take
from
attorneys
or
accountants
and
from
the
constructive
possession
of
the
taxpayers
through
his
lawyers,
this
is
an
unconstitutional
act
on
his
part
and
if
you
use
the
procedures
and
the
statute
would
be
unconstitutional
because
he
can
just
do
it.
there
is
no
requirement
of
any
showing.
for
example
one
of
the
greatest
rights,
we
have
in
this
land,
came
from
the
magna
carta
and
it
was
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
when
that
charter
was
written
at
runnymede,
you
couldn't
even
get
a
search
warrant
on
the
affidavit
of
the
officer
no
matter
how
strong
it
was.
you
had
to
have
a
second
person
to
swear
to
it.
now
we
have
put
that
in
our
constitution
so
that
when
any
person
is
to
be
searched
or
his
property
is
to
be
seized
or
his
papers
taken,
it
can
only
be
done
on
a
showing
of
reasonable
cause
and
your
honors
in
writing
the
new
federal
criminal
rules
have
spelled
that
out
very
clearly
and
you
have
required
this
to
be
done
by
affidavit
and
that
you
must
show
facts
not
conclusions,
that
the
crime
has
been
committed
and
you
must
connect
the
person
up
with
the
crime
against
whom
you
are
going
to
make
the
search,
none
of
this
in
this
particular
section.
so
it's
perfectly
obvious,
that
to
use
this
for
police
purposes
is
certainly
a
direct
violation
of
constitutional
rights,
what
else
did
it
do?
it
would
absolutely
destroy
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
in
every
tax
case.
if
you
can
permit
the
tax
collecting
side
to
use
these
subpoenas
to
get
evidence
to
turn
over
to
their
police,
the
special
agents
as
they
are
called,
to
turn
over
to
grand
juries
to
indict
the
citizen.
now
congress
never
intended
in
this
statute
to
give
mr.
caplin
such
power,
but
he
proposes
and
in
his
brief
he
say
he
intends,
then
he
thinks
he
is
right
that
he
can
take
these
subpoenas,
he
can
gather
this
material
from
the
taxpayers,
not
the
taxpayers,
but
the
attorney's
accountants
and
he
can
use
it
in
both,
civil
tax
cases
against
the
taxpayer
and
in
criminal
proceedings
and
he
even
told
your
honors
in
his
opposition
to
our
petition,
that
in
opposition
when
we
requested
a
stay
in
this
case,
says
he
opposed
a
stay
because
the
statute
of
limitation
was
getting
very
close
to
running
on
the
criminal
prosecution
involved
and
in
the
tax
court
he
asked
the
tax
court
to
continue
the
tax
cases
until
he
got
the
evidence
under
these
subpoenas
because
it
would
help
him
in
the
trial
of
those
cases.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
here
is
your
problem,
enforcement
is
at
three
places.
you've
got
30
days
to
move
in.
you've
got
taxpayers
saying
they
are
going
to
give
it
over,
this
is
our
problem.
if
we
waited,
these
are
ex
parte.
we
are
not
parties
to
these
enforcement
proceedings.
they
would
take
someone
from
the
office
in
chicago,
someone
in
los
angeles,
someone
in
new
york,
bring
them
before
the
hearing
officer
who
is
a
special
agent
not
a
tax
collector.
they
gave
us
the
paper
and
he
doesn't
give
them,
they
walk
in
next
door
to
the
district
court
in
an
ex
parte
hearing
as
for
a
contempt
citation,
he
can
be
cited
for
contempt
or
he
can
voluntarily
give
the
papers.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
the
ex
parte
yes,
all
you
do
is
to
hear
the
subpoena,
the
witness
has
an
answer,
he
asks
for
an
ex
parte
attachment
and
the
judge
could
hold
him
in
contempt
forthwith
ex
parte,
it
has
been
done.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
just
one
case
they've
cited
here
where
that
has
been
done,
which
i
can
give
you
your
honor
in
a
moment.
so
we
were
up
against
this.
we
couldn't
have
protected
the
rights
of
our
clients
if
that
had
happened,
they
would
had
the
papers
let's
be
honest.
they
would
have
had
all
of
our
work
papers,
our
work
sheets,
the
private
papers
of
the
client.
they
would
have
had
them,
and
they
would
have
photostated
them,
made
copies
of
them,
would
we
be
protecting
our
clients
in
a
situation
like
that
if
we
didn't
act
as
we
did,
i
respectfully
submit
not
and
we
don't
have
to
wait.
the
case
is
our
legion
that
you
don't
have
to
wait
for
enforcement
proceedings.
the
cases
arise
when
the
taxpayers
goes
in
court,
a
witness
goes
in
court,
they
file
a
motion,
they
file
a
complaint.
they
file
an
end
reaction
to
have
this
subpoena
measured
as
to
validity
in
a
district
court.
and
the
courts
have
said
they
will
take
jurisdiction
over
these
matters
and
they
have,
on
a
multi
--
in
various
ways,
so
i
respectfully
submit
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
we
would
have
been
lax
if
we
had
waited
and
let
them
go
through
enforcement
to
take
the
papers,
copy
them,
use
them
in
that
manner.
why
can't
it
be
settled
in
the
district
court,
all
the
parties
are
there,
caplin
is
there,
his
agency
here,
we
have
the
accountants
who've
joined
and
you
have
the
attorneys
for
the
taxpayers
to
assert
their
rights.
now
let's
turn
to
the
question
which
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
justice
goldberg
the
case
is
sale
versus
the
united
states,
the
decision
of
the
eight
circuit
228
f.2d
682,
21
of
the
brief.
now
let
us
first
turn
to
the
basis
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case,
that
in
effect
this
was
a
suit
against
the
united
states
and
let's
analyze
that.
the
court
of
appeals
cites
and
this
32
--
commencing
on
page
9
of
our
brief,
the
court
of
appeals
cites
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
larson
versus
domestic
and
foreign
commerce
corporation
and
malone
versus
baldwin
and
states
however
that
these
two
cases
relied
on
concerns
suits
over
property.
but
then
the
race,
the
distinction
between
those
well
defined
categories
of
cases
which
are
very
carefully
listed
in
larson,
so
much
so
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
his
dissent
complied
an
appendix,
in
these
four
categories
and
showed
the
full
lines
of
cases
within
which
the
citizen
can
act
against
representatives
of
the
government
and
where
this
defense
of
immunity
from
suit
does
not
apply.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
lists
these
cases
in
this
fashion;
cases
in
which
the
plaintiff
seeks
an
interest
in
property,
which
concededly
even
under
the
allegation
of
the
compliant
belongs
to
the
government
or
calls
for
assertion
of
what
is
unquestionably
official
authority.
now
this
is
where
you
have
a
suit
in
which
you
cannot
maintain
your
action;
cases
in
which
the
action
to
the
action
to
the
legal
detriment
of
plaintiff
is
taken
by
an
official
justifying
his
action
under
an
unconstitutional
statute.
now
in
those
cases
your
honors
have
held
that
suits
can
be
maintained.
the
next
category
is
cases
where
the
plaintiff
suffers
a
legal
detriment
through
action
of
an
officer
who
has
exceeded
his
statutory
authority
and
four
cases
where
an
officer
seeks
shelter
behind
statutory
authority
or
some
sovereign
command
for
the
commission
of
a
common
law
tort.
now
--
mr.
warren
e.
magee
we
submit
your
honor
that
if
we
are
to
follow
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
that
this
suit
was
involves
practically
each
one
of
these
things,
you
have
tortuous
action,
you
have
unconstitutional
action,
you
have
an
officer
exceeding
his
authority
in
attempting
to
justify
an
invasion
of
property
rights
and
the
privileges
and
constitutional
privileges
of
a
citizen,
his
attorney
are
all
involved
in
his
action.
it
meets
all
four
of
the
requirements,
they
are
all
present
here
and
--
mr.
warren
e.
magee
from
the
larson
case
your
honor
and
i'm
quoting
in
the
footnote
on
page
ten
of
my
brief,
which
is
taken
from
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
where
he
lists
these
categories
and
then
he
lists
all
the
cases
that
were
decided
under
them.
we
say
this,
that
if
in
order
to
sustain
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
admitted
facts
here,
your
honors
are
going
to
have
to
overrule
the
cases
which
we
cite
on
page
11
of
our
brief,
which
commenced
with
the
lee
case
and
end
up
with
the
larson
case,
because
larson
didn't
hold
you
couldn't
sue
where
there's
an
invasion
of
property
rights.
the
larson
case
says
you
can
sue
where
you
have
an
access
of
statutory
authority
or
where
you
have
unconstitutional
actions
by
a
government
officer
and
there
is
nothing
to
the
contrary
in
malone
versus
baldwin
which
merely
followed.
these
cases
turn
on
property
rights
where
an
officer
within
his
authority
takes
property
under
the
authority
of
the
united
states,
as
just
compensation
is
paid
for
these
properties
in
these
situations,
you
have
a
legal
taking
and
the
person
goes
to
the
court
of
claims
or
into
some
court
to
get
his
just
compensation.
your
honors
have
said
in
those
cases
where
the
taking
is
under
the
statute
where
you
have
a
formal
to
get
just
compensation,
then
the
proceedings
are
not
illegal
and
you
cannot
restraint
the
person
who
acts,
but
just
go
back
to
lee,
which
is
typical
example
and
let's
look
at
these
cases
of
what
they
really
are.
here
is
the
family
general
lee.
they
have
the
--
a
plot
of
ground
opposite
the
end
of
the
arlington
memorial
bridge,
the
lee
mansion
and
his
home
site.
the
lee
went
with
the
south,
his
property
was
seized
by
officer
of
the
united
states.
it
was
then
held
by
then
under
the
guise
that
the
lees
hadn't
paid
the
taxes.
the
lees,
of
course
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
pay
the
taxes,
but
they
had
a
friend
who
offered
to
pay
the
taxes,
and
ultimately
when
the
war
was
over
the
lee
family
sued
to
get
back
their
property.
this
court
held
that
that
was,
did
not
vest
title,
that
action
by
the
officer
hiding
behind
the
refusal
to
take
this
tax
bill
and
then
contending
that
united
states
had
titled
because
the
taxes
hadn't
been
paid,
could
not
to
be
maintained
as
a
matter
of
fact.
therefore,
the
officer
was
acting
without
any
authority
and
the
property
belonged
to
the
lee
family.
as
a
result
of
this
opinion,
the
lee's
got
$3000
for
the
property
we
now
have
the
arlington
cemetery
there
and
lee's
mansion
as
a
national
memorial.
then
you
can
run
through
all
of
the
rest
of
these
cases.
if
the
officer
has
authority
and
he
acts
and
he
takes,
this
court
will
not
enjoin
him,
because
he
can
get
just
compensation
for
the
property
that
is
taken.
however,
if
you
have
a,
an
extension
or
exercise
beyond
the
statutory
authority
and
an
invasion
of
rights,
just
as
we
have
here,
this
court
has
never
hesitated
to
step
into
to
protect
the
rights
of
citizens
and
their
rights.
and
it
should
always
protect
against
this
sort
of
action.
now
the
government
argues
that
we
are
stopping
the
tax
proceedings
in
their
tracks.
we
know
that
is
true,
the
cases
have
been
tried,
they
weren't
going
to
use
this
and
they
couldn't
have
used
this
on
tax
code
anyway,
we
know
the
tax
court
will
probably
not
receive
this
because
it
wasn't
obtained
under
the
procedures
authorized
by
that
court.
so
nothing
has
been
delayed.
we
had
--
we
stopped
them
certainly
and
then
still
an
injunction
against
them,
right
to
this
very
day
for
mclee
which
has
been
agreed
upon
throughout
the
court
of
appeals
restraining
them
from
enforcing
these
proceeding,
because
they
said
they
are
going
ahead
with
it
for
criminal
purposes.
so
when
you
analyze
this
business
of
consent,
it's
not
involved
in
this
case
at
all,
because
caplin
is
exceeding
his
statutory
authority.
where
does
he
get
authority
to
subpoena
counsel's
records
to
use
in
a
criminal
case,
to
turn
him
over
to
the
grand
jury?
he
certainly
doesn't
get
it
under
this
section
and
that
is
a
collection
section,
not
a
police
operated
section.
i
am
sure
mr.
justice
goldberg
with
his
experience
knows
exactly
how
that
bureau
furnishes
over
there
and
if
this
is
the
way
it
operates.
and
bear
in
mind,
these
subpoenas
all
were
directed
to
be
returned
before
the
police
and
not
before
the
tax
collector.
they
were
all
to
be
returned
before
the
special
agent
and
not
the
tax
collector.
then
let
us,
the
distinction
between
larson
may
it
please
the
court,
and
the
line
of
cases
upon
which
the
petitioner
relies
was
clearly
expressed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
west
coast
exploration
company
versus
mckay
case.
this
is
on
page
13
of
our
brief
and
here
is
what
the
court
below
in
another
case
said
in
dealing
with
this
principal
of
consent.
in
brief
reaction
or
inaction
question
in
the
larson
case
was
that
of
war
assets
in
the
exercise
of
its
authority
in
disposing
a
surplus
property
of
the
government
and
in
negotiating
and
performing
contracts
for
such
disposal.
it
was
not
charged
in
the
complaint
that
war
assets
had
acted
beyond
that
authority
or
unconstitutionally.
so
how
that
case
helps
the
court
below,
i
cannot
see,
because
that
court
admitted
in
its
findings
and
its
opinion
that
the
complaint
alleges
just
that
and
yet
it
says,
larson
has
authority
for
holding
that
this
is
a
suit
against
the
government
that
is
there,
has
not
consented
therefore
it
cannot
be
sued.
now
what
did
larson
say
on
this
matter.
everyone
relies
very
heavily
on
the
larson
case
and
here
is
what
your
honors
said
and
this
is
quoted
on
page
15
of
the
brief.
where
the
officer's
powers
are
limited
by
statute,
his
actions
beyond
those
limitations
are
considered
individual
and
not
sovereign
actions.
the
officer
is
not
doing
the
business
would
sovereign
as
empowered
him
to
do
or
is
he
doing
it
in
a
way
or
is
doing
it
in
way
which
the
sovereign
has
forbidden.
his
actions
are
ultra
vires
his
authority
and
therefore
maybe
made
the
object
of
specific
relief.
it
is
important
to
note
that
in
such
case
the
relief
can
be
granted
without
impleading
the
sovereign
only
because
of
the
officer's
lack
of
delegated
power
and
to
the
same
effect
is
a
latter
case
of
joint
anti-fascist
refugee
committee
versus
mcgrath
in
341
us.
we
cite
this
on
page
41,
what
did
your
honor
say
there.
where
an
act
of
an
official
plainly
falls
outside
the
scope
of
his
authority
he
does
not
make
that
act
legal
by
doing
it
and
then
invoking
the
doctrine
of
administration
construction
to
cover
it.
and
the
court
of
appeals
following
the
decisions
what
this
court
has
issued
in
the
dollar
case
over
the
years
was
ultimately
resulted
in
contempt
citations
against
various
members
of
the
department
of
commerce
and
the
department
of
justice
for
failure
to
deliver
the
dollar
stock
in
compliance
with
the
orders
of
this
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
below.
now
court
of
appeals
said
this,
in
dollar
versus
land
154
fed
2nd
307,
since
the
court
must
determine
at
the
offset
its
jurisdiction
to
proceed,
it
is
compelled
to
make
a
preliminary
decision
for
jurisdictional
purposes
on
the
ultimate
question
in
the
suit
and
is
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
when
the
merits
are
heard
it
maybe
compelled
to
reach
an
opposition
conclusion.
the
courts
--
yes
sir.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
yes
sir,
the
courts
saw
this
problem
by
accepting
at
their
face
value
for
jurisdictional
purposes
the
assertions
of
complainant
of
one
of
power
in
the
officer
unless
such
assertions
are
so
unsubstantial
and
frivolous
as
to
afford
no
basis
for
jurisdiction.
yes
sir.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
i'd
say
it's
in
the
former
category
clearly,
it
could
be
--
mr.
warren
e.
magee
because
he
has
been
given
authority
and
he
knows
exactly
what
it's
for,
the
statute
fails
it
up,
quite
verbal.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
for
the
--
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
correctness
of
a
tax
and
filing
returns
when
no
returns
are
made,
this
is
what
it's
for.
but
when
he
admittedly
your
honor,
is
going
to
say,
i
am
going
to
use
that
subpoena
not
for
this
purpose
but
to
obtain
evidence
to
use
it
on
criminal
case,
that's
what
he
is
saying.
it's
not
the
sacrum
it's
in
the
first
category.
he
doesn't
have
any
authority,
the
congress
never
gave
it
to
him
and
he
is
clearly
outside
the
scope
of
his
authority
and
he
cannot
hide
behind
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
when
he
does
this.
your
honors'
decisions
are
very
clear
on
this.
it's
not
just
a
mistake
on
his
part.
he
is
acting
clearly
(inaudible)
you
see
here
is
problem
you
have,
we
had
alleged
it
flatly.
he's
never
come
in
and
said,
given
any
answer
for
what
he
is
going
to
do
or
what's
he
intends
to
do
except
as
we
know
it
from
the
police
he's
filed
and
the
actions
he
has
taken
officially
upon
the
public
record,
but
we
know
now
what
he
intended
to
--
mr.
warren
e.
magee
well
mr.
justice
i
must
beg
to
differ
to
with
you.
as
i
understand
the
cases
as
laid
down
by
this
court,
this
is
not
a
mistake.
we
know
the
complaint
alleged
these
unconstitutional
acts.
we
alleged
the
purposes
for
which
these
were
going
to
be
used
and
they
were
not
to
be
used
in
accordance
with
the
statute.
we
allege
this
invasion
of
constitutional
rights,
we
allege
the
privileges
that
are
involved
here.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
that
starts
out,
it
goes,
here
is
what
it
says,
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
correctness
of
any
(inaudible)
making
a
return,
where
none
has
been
made
determining
the
liability
of
any
person
for
internal
revenue
tax
although
liability
at
law
or
equity
were
not
involved
in
the
risk,
because
they
go
over
to
transferees
and
other
persons.
this
is
the
sole
function
that
he
has,
is
to
determine
the
correctness
of
the
tax.
now
he
is
not
using
it
for
this
purpose
sir
if
he
is
going
to
take
and
give
it
to
a
grand
jury.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
i
am
arguing
yes,
but
it's
the
other
way
around
may
it
please
mr.
justice
goldberg.
these
were
not
used
to
determine
the
correctness
of
any
tax
and
litigation
even.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
and
he
was
using
it
according
to
his
own
admissions
now
which
we
charged
in
the
complaint,
bear
in
mind
these
are
all
charges,
he
has
admitted
that
he
is
using
it
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
evidence
to
submit
before
grand
jury
and
congress
didn't
give
him
that
authority
and
if
they
did
this
is
an
unconstitutional
statute
because
it
wouldn't
operate
--
if
you
operate
that
way
it's
unconstitutional
sir.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
well
i
say
this
again,
that
he
is
using
that
statue
for
an
unauthorized
purpose,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
congress
didn't
give
him
power
to
go
out
subpoena
matters
for
presentation
to
grand
jury
by
this
statute,
it
never
intended
that
at
all
and
bear
in
mind
when
you
get
into
--
mr.
warren
e.
magee
that's
not
what
he
is
given
by
this
statute,
no
sir.this
is
a
collection
statute
only
because
you
get
into
very
serious
constitutional
questions
if
you
are
going
to
try
to
do
that
with
it
mr.
justice
goldberg,
because
here
is
your
problem.
that's
discovery
in
a
criminal
case,
that's
all
it
is.
it's
a
search
and
seizure
that's
what
it
becomes
and
it's
subject
to
the
constitutional
limitations
on
searches
and
seizures.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
well
that
question
is
right
here,
that's
what
he
is
doing
it
for
--
mr.
warren
e.
magee
yes
sir.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
i
say
precisely
that,
because
you
have
a
very
--
if
congress
is
going
to
do
this,
it's
got
to
be
spelled
out
in
a
statute
with
all
the
safeguards
that
the
constitution
requires
and
give
them
that
authority.
if
congress
want
into
to
use
this
method
to
get
evidence
for
grand
juries
mr.
justice
goldberg
they
could
say
so,
in
very
unmistaken
terms
and
they
could
put
in
that
statute
those
requirements
which
would
be
necessary
to
make
it
constitutional,
but
to
just
say
if
an
issue
was
subpoena
–
mr.
warren
e.
magee
fraud
section
yeah.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
well,
i'm
saying
that
if
that
section
uses
this
revenue
subpoenas
for
police
purposes
to
get
evidence
to
use
in
a
criminal
case
yes
sir,
it's
unconstitutional
because
it
is
--
mr.
warren
e.
magee
i
don't
say
that.
i
say
that
this,
that
if
they
going
to
turn
this
evidence
over
which
is
gotten
for
one
purpose
and
use
it
in
a
criminal
case,
that
is
not
authorized
by
the
statute
and
it's
unconstitutional
to
do
it.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
it
cannot
in
the
absence
of
a
waiver
and
you
go
in
your
office
and
they
ask
you
these
things
and
make
you
sign
a
waiver
so
you
can
use
it
and
if
you
don't
sign
a
waiver
and
they
attempt
to
use
it
in
this
fashion,
it's
a
violation
of
your
constitutional
right
that's
why
we
have
waivers,
that's
exactly
the
way
the
department
handles
it.
the
fbi
handles
it
that
way
when
they
go
to
interview
a
witness,
to
gather
up
information.
absent
the
constitutional
waiver,
they
have
no
right
to
seize
it
and
this
is
the
problem,
because
in
our
case
it
would
have
already
gone
into
their
possession
long
before
we
as
the
attorneys
could
ever
got
to
litigating
that
question,
if
we
didn't
take
this
direct
approach
to
raise
it
at
the
first
instance
where
all
the
parties
are
before
the
court.
now
your
honors
note
from
your
own
experience
many
of
us
have
been
in
justice
and
the
other
departments,
this
is
a
way
you
handle
it.
when
you
bring
a
citizen
in
and
you
say
you
are
going
to
take
a
statement
from
him
and
then
you
are
going
to
hand
it
to
the
grand
jury
well
you
better
get
a
waiver
on
it
before
you
do
it,
because
it's
not
going
to
be
admissible
before
it
goes
before
the
grand
jury
it
may
vitiate
the
whole
proceeding
if
a
courts
look
at
it.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
well,
it
maybe
but
then
the
trouble
with
it
is
this,
and
our
courts
have
held
that
if
you
take
evidence
illegally
and
if
the
government,
you
can't
use
it
for
any
purpose
this
is
the
problem.
thus
for
example
when
you
have
an
illegal
search
warrant
what
happens
to
evidence
it
goes
back
to
the
person
from
whom
the
evidence
was
taken
and
it
can
never
be
used
in
any
case
after
that.
this
is
your
basic
problem
you
have
and
this
is
why
you
have
safeguard,
why
do
we
have
a
constitution?
why
do
we
have
the
tort
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
if
this
sort
of
thing
is
going
to
be
tolerated,
where
you
can
take
the
work
papers
bear
this
in
mind,
these
are
not
the
taxpayer's
papers
these
are
work
products,
the
privilege
material
which
are
in
the
hands
of
the
attorneys.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
i
am
going
getting
to
this
because
this
is
what
involves
in
this
case.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
yes
sir,
i
know
that's
a
different
problem
all
together
because
see
they
haven't
gotten
these
papers
yet,
so
they
can't
use
them.
the
problem
--
i
beg
your
honor's
pardon.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
oh
no,
no
the
courts
go
beyond
that,
the
constitutional
argument
the
courts
have
held
and
we
have
cited
them
in
our
brief
that
an
accountant
can
raise
it,
the
attorney
can
raise
it,
the
witness
can
rise
it.
there
are
cases
though,
they
go
both
ways
in
this
field
we've
got
them
all
lined
up
in
our
brief
for
your
honors
on
these
points.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
yes
sir,
but
protecting
his
right,
yes
sir
and
that's
where
we
are
in
the
picture
as
the
attorney
and
we
say
mr.
justice
clark
that
the
accountants
are
in
our
office,
just
as
secretary
and
their
work
is
covered
by
this
attorney
privilege
and
work
product
rule.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
yes
sir,
we
have
had
even
more
--
i
think
it
has
more
problems
than
that
mr.
justice
clark.
it
has
privilege,
it
has
the
work
paper
principle,
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
if
he
is
going
to
use
this
in
a
criminal
case,
it's
a
discovery
proceeding,
that
congress
has
been
very
--
mr.
warren
e.
magee
well
it
could
be
against
--
yes
it's
a
discovery.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
yes
sir.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
no
sir,
we
say
in
this
position
your
honor
these
papers
or
the
lawyer's
papers
given
them
to
in
this
private
capacity
from
the
client.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
that's
another
constitution
--
mr.
warren
e.
magee
well,
again
we
say
that
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel
protects
that
attorney
client
privilege
otherwise
the
cases
hold
that
you
have
no
counsel
at
all.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
this
is
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
yes
sir.
this
is
under
another
section
of
the
constitution.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
yes
sir
because
the
section
here
is
the
situation.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
yes
we
rely
on
the
fourth,
fifth
and
sixth
as
being
violated
here.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
it's
called
the
confidential
relationship
between
the
attorney
and
client
which
the
courts
will
protect
in
order
that
he
have
effective
assistance
to
counsel.
well
let's
carry
it
to
its
logical
conclusion.
sure
it's
the
clients
right,
but
that
effective
assistance
of
counsel
is
another
guaranteed
right
by
the
constitution,
yes
sir,
yes
sir
and
it's
the
duty
of
the
lawyer
to
render
it
and
to
protect
his
client's
rights
in
these
fields
as
the
counsel
protecting
his
constitutional
rights.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
yes
sir,
we
are
going
to,
we
get
to
that.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
well,
i
am
sure
they
could
see,
when
you
read
this
brief.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
no
actually
what
the
government
is
saying
is
this,
i
think
they
are
going
to,
well,
i
don't
know
how
to
characterize
it,
they
don't
belabor
this
consent,
that
this
is
an
action
without
the
consent
of
the
government,
they
don't
belabor
that
point
very
much.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
yeah,
they
say
this,
because
under
enforcement
your
constitutional
rights
can
be
protected.
this
is
what
they
say,
when
you
get
a
problem
like
this
and
here
is
another
thing
they
say
which
shows
what's
wrong
with
this
lawsuit.
solicitor
general
now
says,
you
had
a
right
to
sue
people
at
peat,
marwick,
and
mitchell,
you
had
a
right
and
we
did
just
that
here,
but
they
got
the
court
to
dismiss
it
not
only
as
to
them
but
as
to
peat,
marwick,
and
mitchell.
so
that
where
do
we
stand,
if
this
is
supposed
to
be
they
say
that's
the
way
to
work
to
enforce
that.
now
here
is
what
--
i
don't
understand
frankly
in
the
solicitor's
position
and
they
just
as
well
discuss
it
now
your
honors.
he
says
that
this
section
of
the
code
furnishes
a
complete
method
of
protection
to
all
parties.
it
doesn't
do
anything
of
the
kind,
all
it
does,
it
says
first
the
district
courts
in
the
area
where
the
subpoena
was
issued
shall
have
jurisdiction
and
then
when
you
go
down
it
has
exactly
what
it
says
in
enforcement.
now
this
is
enforcement
given
to
mr.
caplin,
nobody
else.
no
procedures
are
provided,
but
what
the
clients
could
do,
what
anyone
should
do
and
the
only
thing
if
he
follows
this
statute
correctly,
the
only
way
and
he's
never
followed
it
in
this
fashion
except
once,
the
only
way
you
could
function
under
this
statute
is
to
ask
for
an
attachment
for
content,
that's
all
the
statute
authorizes,
it
doesn't
actually
authorize
enforcement,
it
doesn't
authorize
anything
else.
this
is,
this
is
a
way
to
enforce
it,
take
a
witness
before
judge,
get
an
attachment
for
contempt
and
there
it
stops.
that's
the
only
procedure
stated
in
the
statute.
then
the
government
argues
that
when
congress
did
this,
it
took
away
all
other
procedures,
the
federal
procedure
act,
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
the
general
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
protect
against
unconstitutional
are
all
out
the
window
and
this
is
your
only
method
and
you
may
not
even
be
there
when
this
happens,
because
these
are
witness
who
has
your
papers
as
peat,
marwick,
and
mitchell,
you
know
nothing
about
it,
he
subpoenaed,
let's
assume
we
are
not
even
notified.
they
take
him
before
as
in
this
case
an
internal
revenue
agent,
special
agent,
say
i
want
the
papers
and
they
see,
says
well
i
can't
give
them
to
you,
it
don't
belong
to
me,
i
think
they
are
privileged,
he
walks
across
the
street
to
a
district
judge
and
won
a
attachment
for
contempt,
holding
in
contempt
and
deliver
the
papers,
now
that's
what
this
provides,
that's
all
it
provides.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
well,
that's
true
because
the
cases
don't
support
the
commissioner's
contention
in
this
regard
mr.
justice.
what
the
cases
hold
is,
that
the
taxpayer
can
come
in,
if
some
third
person
is
coming
in
to
testify
there
is
something
concerning
him
and
raise
a
constitutional
point,
the
witness
can
go
in
court
in
his
own
enforcement
proceeding,
you
can
do
it
in
re,
you
can
sue
the
agent,
you
can
file
a
motion,
and
raise
these
issues
in
court.
and
there
as
a
contrary
we
decided
the
case
and
the
government's
got
many
of
them
in
there,
in
which
this
is
done.
he
had
all
these
procedures
but
not
one
of
them
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
statute.
they
had
a
relation
to
it.
if
you
read
the
enforcement
provisions
of
the
statute
you
will
see
this.
now,
i
want
to
just
discuss
briefly
and
i
know
i
am
taking
a
little
more
of
my
original
allotted
time,
we
of
course
contend
your
honors
that
there
is
an
attorney
client
privilege
covering
these
documents.
we
think
it,
in
a
modern
age
where
you
got
cases,
which
involve
matters
spread
let's
say
all
over
the
country
or
all
over
the
world,
no
lawyer
has
particularly
in
tax
cases
can
function
without
accounting
services,
and
when
they
as
distinguish
from
the
taxpayer
have
in
their
office
or
go
out
and
hire
accountants
just
as
you
would
hire
an
interpreter
to
interpret
private
documents
of
the
client
in
your
office,
hire
an
expert
in
an
medical
practice
case,
hire
an
architect
in
a
case
involving
architectural
problem
after
the
litigation
arises,
these
are
all
matters
which
come
out
of
the
attorney
client
relationship
and
the
products
become
the
work
products
of
counsel.
congress
has
never
authorized
them
to
be
seized
at
all.
your
honors
made
that
very
clear
in
hickman
versus
taylor
because
there
you
had
the
broadest
type
of
discovery
authorized
under
rule
26
of
the
rule
of
the
civil
procedure,
but
you
held
very
flatly
you
are
not
going
to
permit
that
rule
to
be
used
for
this
purpose,
because
it
would,
what
it
does,
it
destroys
the
office
of
an
advocate,
that
what's
it
would
do.
it
means
you
got
carry
everything,
he
has
to
do
it
all
along
and
to
permit
this
work
product
that
they
reached
in
this
manner
wouldn't
even
be
permissible
under
rule
26.
now,
let's
look
at
the
criminal
rules,
where
in
the
criminal
rules
did
the
government
do
this,
but
your
honors
promulgated
under
the
constitution,
you
don't
authorize
discovery
by
the
united
states
to
take
a
client
by
the
(inaudible),
it's
not
authorized.
and
we
say
the
congress
never
intended
to
here
and
therefore
this
is
an
invasion
of
the
client,
attorney
client
privilege.
your
honor
instead
of
arguing
this
commencing
on
page
26
of
the
brief
where
this
case
is
on
standing
in
which
the
court
have
permitted
accountants,
lawyers,
persons
other
than
the
taxpayer
to
move
into
these
type
of
proceedings
and
assert
the
rights
of
the
parties
involved.
we
have
analyzed
the
situation
and
it's
our
contention
that
the
finding
below
is
clearly
erroneous.
we
now,
because
it
has
a
charge
of
an
unlawful
exercise
of
power,
excess
of
statutory
power
on
behalf
of
the
commissioner,
the
invasion
of
the
attorney
client
privilege,
the
destruction
of
the
effective
assistant
to
counsel
guaranteed
and
also
be
an
attempt
to
procure
by
discovery
the
work
product
of
counsel.
therefore,
under
our
contention
we
had
standing
to
sue.
all
parties
were
before
the
court
and
the
temporary
restraining
order
which
we
requested
at
the
trail
level
should
have
been
granted
just
as
judge
curran
granted
the
first
preliminary
injunction
and
temporary
restarting
order.
and
we
submit
that
the
basis
urged
by
the
court
below
is
unsound
because
this
complaint
meets
all
of
standards
which
your
honors
have
setup
as
justifying
the
suit
against
an
officer
in
the
larson
and
the
cases
following
it.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
there
never
had
been
any
enforcement
procedure.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
no
sir,
they
never
had
it.
i'd
say
we
had,
they
had
been
enjoined
from
the
time
we
filed
our
original
compliant
enforcing
the
subpoenas
because
they
have
always
asserted
they
would
and
they
were
going
to
use
in
criminal
proceedings.
mr.
robert
said
that
the
department
was
kind
enough
to
agree
that
this
should
stay
in
effect
until
the
appeal
is
disposed
off,
we
had
a
stipulation
to
that
effect
and
that's
the
way
it's
been
handled
your
honor.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
i'd
like
to
answer
a
few
of
the
matters
brought
--
mr.
warren
e.
magee
oh
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
thank
you,
your
honor.
first
i
want
to
point
out
that
it
was
stated
and
you'll
find
on
page
83
of
the
tax
court
that
all
these
subpoenas
were
being
issued
for
the
propose
of
getting
evidence
to
use
in
the
tax
cases.
and
in
their
opposition
they've
indicated
they're
going
to
use
them
in
criminal
proceedings
and
in
that
regard
we
have
a
decision
which
is
very
clear
on
that
point,
which
is
united
states
versus
o'connor,
which
states
the
matter
much
better
than
i
can,
it
appears
on
page
19
of
the
brief,
it
says
this.
district
court
of
massachusetts,
“so
far
as
this
court
knows
congress
has
never
in
criminal
matters
vested
the
executive
with
an
unrestricted
subpoena
power
to
uncover
information
which
might
aid
in
the
enforcement
of
criminal
statues
and
the
preparation
of
criminal
cases,”
citing
a
number
of
cases,
rule
17
(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
federal
procedure
has
only
the
limited
function
of
procuring
production
of
papers
for
use
in
evidence
at
the
trial.
i
see
my
time
is
up
your
honors,
i
submit
that
this
case
--
mr.
warren
e.
magee
on
page
19
of
our
--
just
a
moment.
i'm
sorry
i
was
reading
from
page
19
of
our
brief,
the
decision
your
honor
is
118
f.
supp.
248.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
and
he
says
that
the
constitution
prohibits
this
and
we
have
our
procedures
and
his
language
is
much
more
elegant
than
any
i
could
say.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
let
me
see
how
this
arose.
mr.
warren
e.
magee
yes.
this
was
in
an
enforcement
proceeding.
but
of
course
on
enforcements
your
honor
it
is
ridiculous
to
say
time
is
going
to
be
saved
by
going
up
through
three
circuits,
because
you
have
to
go
up
to
new
york,
chicago
or
los
angeles.
when
we've
got
it
all
in
one
proceeding
and
this
certainly
prevents
a
multitude
of
suits
and
gets
this
train
on
the
track,
not
often
in
various
fields,
where
it
should
be
and
for
that
purpose
alone
the
court
should
take
jurisdiction
of
this
matter.
now
that
we
see
that
really
sovereign
immunity
is
not
the
issue
because
they
admit
we
can
at
least
enjoin
the
accountants
and
that
would
hold
up
the
whole
works
until
it's
all
over
with,
thank
you
your
honors.
