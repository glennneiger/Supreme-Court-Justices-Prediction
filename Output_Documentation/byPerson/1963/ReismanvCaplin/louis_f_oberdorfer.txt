mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
just
say
at
the
outset
that
we
don't
have
here
any
issue
of
standing.
we
don't
have
any
issue
here
in
view
of
the
very
careful
professional
arrangements
that
were
made
between
the
attorney
or
the
attorneys
and
the
accountants
as
to
whether
or
not
the
accountants
or
the
attorneys
in
this
situation
have
a
property
interest
sufficient
to
enable
them
to
bring
this
action.
we
also
have
tried
to
make
it
clear
in
our
brief
that
any
of
these
constitutional
issues
about
self
incrimination,
and
any
of
the
other
issues
of
whether
the
constitutional
or
ethical
otherwise
pertaining
to
intrusion
on
the
attorney
client
privilege
or
intrusion
on
the
attorney
work
product
are
assumed
to
be
debatable
in
a
subsequent
enforcement
proceeding.
our
position
is
first
of
all,
that
this
action,
against
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
on
account
the
summons
filed
by
a
revenue
agent
subordinate
of
the
commissioner
is
a
suit
against
the
united
states
to
which
it
has
not
consented.
and
in
the
alternative
or
in
addition
we
show
in
our
brief
and
argue
here
that
there
is
no
basis
for
this
proceeding,
because
there
is
a
complete
inadequate
remedy
provided
by
congress,
a
forum,
opportunity
for
hearing
on
all
of
these
objections
should
the
subpoena
documents
be
presented
and
an
enforcement
offers
or
order
them
sought
with
respect
to.
the
context
of
a
case
like
--
getting
down
to
close
quarters
in
a
case
like
this
sometimes
causes
you
to
loose
perspective
of
the
function
of
the
whole
tax
system.
we
sometimes
forget
when
we
get
down
to
close
litigation
on
issues
like
this
that
our
tax
system
is
a
self
assessment
system.
it
assumes
that
taxpayers
voluntarily
file
full
and
complete
returns
and
60
million
do
every
year.
it
also
assumes
in
order
to
function
that
those
returns
are
subject
to
audit.
this
is
the
way
the
system
works.
when
somebody
sits
down
and
prepares
his
return,
he
knows
or
should
know
that
he
is
going
to
be
asked
or
maybe
asked
by
revenue
agent
about
the
accuracy
of
what
he
says
and
maybe
required
to
substantiate
what
is
on
the
return
and
the
internal
revenue
service
in
fact
audits
3.5
million
returns
a
year.
this
law
assumes
that
there
must
be
a
procedure
for
enforcing
that
law
for
enquiring
closely
to
make
sure
that
honest
taxpayer
isn't
demoralized
by
the
prospect
or
this
will
not
beyond.
and
the
congress
has
had
for
long
time
statutory
procedures
whereby
revenue
agents
can
if
a
taxpayer
is
not
or
somebody
who
has
had
dealings
with
a
taxpayer
is
not
willing
voluntarily
to
make
his
books
and
records
available
to
have
an
administrative
subpoena
issued
for
the
production
of
those
books.
the
statute
7602
quoted
on
page
56
of
our
brief
has
been
quoted
before
but
we
should
use
it
as
a
point
of
departure,
says
that
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
correctness
of
any
return,
it's
one
of
the
things,
the
secretary
is
delegate
and
in
this
the
revenue
agent
in
honolulu
especially
agent
honolulu
is
authorized
to
examine
books,
to
summon
a
person
to
bring
books,
papers,
records,
and
other
data.
now,
we
should
look
closely
at
the
summons
issued
in
this
case.
it
appears
there
are
several
of
them
that
were
attached
to
the
complaint,
samples
appear
on
pages
19
through
23.
the
summons
in
this
case
was
issued,
or
the
summons
were
issued
with
respect
to
tax
liability
of
the
taxpayer
bromley
but
notice
that
the
summons
on
page
19
refers
to
the
years
1957,
1958,
and
1959.
these
summons
called
for
the
books,
documents,
and
records
in
the
custody
of
the
accountant
which
pertained
to
corporations
listed
below
and
all
of
their
subsidiaries
and
on
page
21
has
set
out
the
gamut
of
corporations
through
which
it
was
suspected
or
believed
that
this
taxpayer
was
operating
through
out
the
world,
a
very
complex
situation.
the
subpoena
further
called,
these
reminds
your
honors
on
pages
20,
these
are
books
and
records
of
corporations,
no
individual
name
there,
the
taxpayer
himself
was
not
named.
then
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
it
called
for
audit
reports,
work
papers
and
correspondence
and
this
also
related
to
the
years
1957
through
1959,
but
it
called
for,
in
addition
to
some
trade
names,
these
are
individuals
and
partnerships
and
included
there
for
the
years
1957
through
1959,
audit
reports,
work
papers,
and
correspondence
in
the
custody
of
the
accountants
which
pertained
in
those
individuals.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes,
sir,
martin
j.
brown.
the
tax
court
proceedings
about
which
counsel
has
spoken
and
about
--
which
are
referred
to
in
the
litigation
in
the
papers,
where
with
respect
to
the
tax
years
1953
through
1956,
so
that
these
two
subpoenas
didn't
--
this
particular
subpoena
did
not
call
for
anything
that
referred
to
the
years
in
the
tax
court
that
he
--
and
i
cite
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
any
years
that
were
involved
in
the
tax
court
litigation.
now
there
are
–
there's
another
set
of
subpoenas,
a
sample
of
which
appears
on
page
23,
which
is
limited
to
books,
documents
and
records
of
corporations.
this
does
involve
the
years
1953
through
1959,
which
includes
the
years
involved
in
the
tax
court
proceeding.
and
it
does,
it
is
however
limited
to
corporations
and
does
not
call
for
any
records
of
the
taxpayer.
i
cite
this
among
other
things
your
honors
as
an
indication
that
the
special
agent
in
framing
these
subpoenas
gave
some
thought,
maybe
he
made
a
mistake
in
some
respect
but
he
did
not
write
a
rough
shot
or
intended
to
write
rough
shot
over
the
rights
of
the
taxpayer
as
respect
--
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
there
maybe
issues
involved.
it
may
be
that
this
subpoena
called
for
things,
some
things
with
respect
to
which
when
the
whole
pile
of
books
and
papers
call
for
were
set
down
on
a
table
and
there
was
a
colloquy
about
them
there
may
have
been
found
in
a
hearing
before
the
special
agent
that
some
things
were
privileged
or
that
some
--
in
the
constitutional
sense
or
that
some
things
called,
some
of
the
subpoena
some
of
the
things
called
for
in
the
subpoena
would
not
be
proper
for
production
because
it
intruded
on
the
attorney-client
privilege
or
because
it
involved
bona
fide
work
papers.
but
to
say
that
it's
because
they
may
have
been
produced
in
response
to
the
summons,
some
things
which
were
privileged
is
not
say
that
the
summons
is
therefore
void
as
either
exceeding
the
statutory
authority
of
the
commissioner
or
his
agent
or
void
in
the
sense
that
it
intrudes
on
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
taxpayer,
who
is
–
whose
rights
are
to
the
matter
of
concern
here
and
not
so
rather
than
the
rights
really
of
the
attorney
or
the
rights
of
the
accountant.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
it
would
not
--
it
is
the
practice
to
use
administrative
subpoenas
in
investigations
which
involve
--
which
end
up
either
in
recommendations
of
criminal
prosecution
or
decisions
not
to
prosecute.
it's
a
–
once
you
are
given
the
authority
to
determine
the
--
if
the
commissioner
is
given
the
authority
of
the
statute
to
determine
the
correctness
of
the
return,
just
first
dealing
with
the
statuary
question
before
we
get
to
some
possible
constitutional
questions.
so
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned
it
would
be
very
hard
to
start
out
determining
the
correctness
of
a
return
and
then
somehow
switch
off
when
it
appeared
for
the
first
time
that
there
was
the
possibility
that
there
would
be
a
criminal
prosecution.
in
determining
the
correctness
of
the
return
the
fact
is
that
maybe
the
public
doesn't
believe
it,
but
the
fact
is
that
many
returns
are
examined
and
found
to
be
correct
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
if
a
return
is
found
to
be
incorrect
or
if
there
is
a
reason
to
believe
that
the
return
is
incorrect
and
one
of
two
things
happen;
either
the
investigation
is
completed
without
any
suspicion
or
determination
of
fraud
and
deficiency
is
asserted
and
either
the
tax
is
then
paid
administratively
or
the
taxpayer
uses
his
civil
remedies
in
the
tax
court
or
by
paying
his
tax
and
suing
in
various
place
for
a
refund
and
that
process
goes
on
quite
by
flow.
and
the
commissioner
and
his
representative
may
also
determine
that
by
--
he
may
suspect
that
income
has
been
omitted
or
that
there
he
see
--
what
appears
to
be
a
forged
document
or
other
evidences
of
fraud,
in
that
event
he
is
still
determining
the
correctness
of
the
return
and
he
pursues
his
investigation.
he
may
having
investigated
by
use
of
summons
or
otherwise
determine
that
there
wasn't
any
fraud.
the
return
is
not
correct,
but
there
is
no
fraud
that's
it's
resolved
on
a
civil
basis
or
if
this
revenue
service
and
there
are
several
echelons
of
procedure
here,
if
the
whole
process
of
the
revenue
service
determines
that
in
their
opinion
the
return
is
not
only
not
correct,
but
that
a
violation
of
criminal
statute
has
occurred
they
don't
send
the
material
to
a
grand
jury.
they
send
it
to
the
--
they
send
the
file
to
the
department
of
justice
and
we
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
we
think
the
case
should
be
prosecuted.
now
when
they
send
the
field
they
send
everything
they've
collected
by
the
civil
process
and
by
the
criminal
--
the
intelligence
investigation
using
summon.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
your
honor
i
would
--
i
am
not
prepared
-
i
don't
know
why
in
this
case
three
subpoenas
were
served
on
three
branches
of
peat,
marwick.
without
casting
any
aspersions
i
have
the
impression
that
the
internal
revenue
service
had
sufficient
experience
with
this
situation
to
feel
that
it
had
to
use
possibly
an
abundance
of
caution
in
making
sure
that
papers
didn't
disappear
or
if
that
there
was
--
they
weren't
victims
of
some
shell
game
where
they
had
service
subpoena
here
and
it
turned
that
the
papers
were
over
there.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
don't
think
that
the
--
at
the
supreme
court
level
the
equities
ought
to
be
balanced
in
terms
of
whether
it
would
be
more
convenient
to
have
one
lawsuit
in
the
district
of
columbia
or
three
lawsuits.
we're
sufficiently
in
control
of
our
litigating
arrangements
so
that
i'm
sure
that
we
could
stipulate
if
it's
a
matter
of
convenience,
we
could
stipulate
it
and
i
would
offer
to
stipulate
here
that
we
would
hold
in
abeyance
enforcement
in
two
districts
while
the
matter
was
litigated
in
the
most
--
in
the
district
most
convenient
to
the
taxpayer
or
his
representative
in
an
enforcement
proceeding.
i
think
that's
a
red
herring,
your
honor
really.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that
is
the
convenience
of
litigation.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well
i
--
it
may
be
that
some
of
the
taxpayer
might
have
this
problem
some
other
place,
but
i
offer
that
the
record
evidence
of
the
agreements
that
have
been
made
and
the
discipline
with
which
these
accountants
and
lawyers
have
marched
all
the
way
through
this
litigation
minimize
the
prospect
that
peat,
marwick
would
do
anything
in
violation
of
the
explicit
and
implicit
arrangements
between
them.
but
if
there
is
any
such
risk
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
would
think
then
that
either
this
action
is
perhaps
not
--
maybe
not
be
the
proper
forum
for
them
to
enjoin
peat,
marwick,
but
i
would
think
wherever
peat,
marwick's
principal
place
of
business
maybe,
if
they
filed
an
action
there,
they
could
get
a
restraining
order
and
i
think
we
have
shown
in
our
relationship
while
this
matter
is
pending
that
we're
not
going
to
stampede
peat,
marwick
into
doing
something
that
they
would
prefer
not
to
do.
that
is
if
peat,
marwick
came
in
with
these
papers,
just
to
take
it
another
point,
because
when
you
stop
to
think
about
all
of
the
many
ways
in
which
this
calamity
has
been
charged
here
can
be
avoided,
it
makes
this
case
seem
rather
thin.
peat,
marwick
had
come
in,
in
response
to
the
subpoena.
it
is
inconceivable
to
me
that
peat,
marwick,
would
not
tell
their
employer,
which
is
the
relationship
that's
been
alleged,
that
they've
been
subpoenaed
and
that
at
a
certain
time
they
are
going
or
that
they
would
fail
to
invite
their
employer
to
go
with
them,
their
employer
being
their
attorney.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well,
i'd
say
there's
a
short
answer
i'm
sorry
to
have
wandered,
the
short
answer
is
let
them
be
enjoined
if
the
remedy
is
to
enjoin
peat,
marwick
not
stop
the
administration
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
we
didn't
represent
peat,
marwick
in
that
and
i
could
imagine
--
i
should
imagine
they
could
have
considered
to
an
injunction
and
we
couldn't
have
done
a
thing
about
it.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well
your
honor
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that
is
our
position.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
your
honor,
the
--
two
worries,
one
is
delay
which
speaks
for
itself.
if
after
this
proceeding
there
are
still
some
matters
that
need
--
that
are
not
covered
by
this
injunction,
there
may
still
--
we
may
serve
the
subpoena
with
respect
to
what's
left
of
it
and
have
to
litigate
the
enforcement
proceeding.
you
create
a
new
--
a
whole
new
layer
of
litigation
if
every
taxpayer
can
enjoin
the
commissioner.
let's
say
for
example
that's
it's
decided
that
if
anybody
believes
that
the
--
that
response
to
an
administrative
summons
involves
a
threat
to
his
constitutional
right
against
self
incrimination,
he
can
bring
an
injunction
proceeding.
you
have
a
very
--
you
have
a
new
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
correct.
but
the
--
having
raised
that
question
here
in
a
limited
injunction
proceeding
he
still
has
all
the
other
things
that
have
to
be
worked
out
in
an
enforcement
proceeding.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
in
this
case
there
is
the
attorney
client
privilege
and
the
privilege
--
the
work
product
problem.
there
could
be
the
question
of
whether
he
actually
--
whether
he
had
procession
of
particular
books
and
papers,
whether
he
had
disposed
of
possession
in
an
effect
to
frustrate
the
subpoena
and
in
fraud
of
it.
our
point
is,
the
other
side
--
apart
from
the
delay
and
the
delay
is
illustrated
by
what
has
happened
in
reported
cases
in
the
colton
case
and
in
the
magnus
case,
these
things
have
gone
up
and
down
and
finally
enforcement
has
begun
or
the
summons
has
finally
been
responded
to,
but
the
other
thing,
the
other
point
that
affects
the
administration
of
the
tax
law,
as
the
administration
of
the
justice
which
we
think
is
quite
serious,
the
--
there
is
a
sort
of
an
exhaustion
of
remedies,
the
exhaustion
of
the
administrative
remedy
aspect
here.
the,
i
started
it
just
sort
of
describe
how
a
proceeding
would
go.
there
would
be
a
response
to
the
subpoena.
the
accountant
in
this
case
would
come
in
with
the
books.
there
would
be
an
inventory
of
the
books.
we
would,
before
the
agent
there
would
be,
it
would
determined
whether
there
was
anything
in
there
that
really
belonged
to
the
taxpayer
himself
as
a
person
and
presumably
agent
would
say
take
that
back
and
the
whole
issue
could
be
narrowed
in
a
hearing
before
the
special
agent
before
we
ever
get
to
court
and
then
if
there
is
a
specific
documents
that
or
refused
production
we
know
what
those
documents
are,
if
there
are
specific
questions
which
are
refused
to
answer
we
know
what
those
questions
are
and
then
we
go
to
court
and
the
court
has,
has
a
case
or
controversy.
it's
got
--
it's
got
something
to
work
with.
it's
got
facts,
it's
got
a
context,
it's
got
particular
document
and
we
just
think
that
congress
planned
it
that
way
and
it
--
this
is
a
better,
more
business
like
way
to
proceed
and
that
it
is
not
unfair,
it
doesn't
jeopardize
any
constitutional
rights
of
anybody.
it
protects
any
other
objection
anybody
can
have
and
this
is
our
argument
for
--
our
policy
argument
for
opposing
the
position
urged
by
petitioner.
the
--
we
don't
concede
that
it
would
be
possible
for
someone
to
be
forced
to
comply
with
the
subpoena
without
hearing.
we
know
of
no
such
case.
there
is
a
procedure
for
the
attachment,
a
body
attachment,
but
that
is
where
--
there
are
some
rough
characters
in
the
world
and
sometime
to
get
people
in
court
you
have
to
go
get
them
and
bring
them.
and
--
but
when
he
gets
into
court
he
is
entailed
to
a
hearing
on
question
of
whether
or
not
he
should
be
--
and
they
be
required
to
produce
and
(inaudible)
should
be
required
to
be
produce?
and
if
there
are
--
if
there
haven't
been
--
if
there
have
been
cases
where
a
hearing
has
been
denied,
i
would
assume
that
what
this
court
says
about
this
case
would
preclude
that
in
the
future.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
not
that
i
have
been
able
to
think
of
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
you
mean
like
the
antitrust
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
there
is
no
immunity
to
that.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
no
sir,
i
would
assume
that
if
a
taxpayer
is
compelled
to
answer
in
the
take
of
a
valid
claim
of
his
privilege
that
any
conviction
of
him
would
be
reversible
in
that
sense
i
think
it's
immune.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
they
never
focused
on
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
the
--
i
hesitate,
your
honor
because
there
is
a,
there
is
a
criminal
sanction.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
--
which
is
provided
by
section
7210.
now
we
have
dealt
with
that
in
the
brief,
that
is,
that
statute
on
its
face
makes
it
a
crime
to
neglect
to
comply
with
the
subpoena.
two
or
three
things
about
that
if
someone
subpoenaed
actually
brought
the
books
into
the
special
agent
and
laid
them
on
the
table
and
retained
possession
of
them
that
certainly
would
seem
us
to
be
compliance
whether
he
then
answered
questions
in
the
face
of
plea
as
--
we
would
think
that's
not
actionable.
the
one
case
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
if
he
brought
him
in
and
said
--
and
say
here
are
my
books,
but
i
have
--
i
am
not
going
to
let
you
look
at
them
because
to
do
so
would
violate
my
privilege
against
self-incrimination
or
to
do
so
would
intrude
on
privileged
communications
between
myself
and
my
attorney,
or
would
take
from
me
the
work
product
of
my
attorney.
i
would
think
that
a
motion
to
dismiss
an
indictment
brought
on
that
ground
if
we
were
foolish
enough
or
someone
was
foolish
enough
to
bring
one
with
law,
i
do
--
we
--
with
the
one
decision
that
we
found
on
this
subject
says
that
this
thing
is,
this
crime
is
permitted
only
if
someone
willfully
violates
it.
we
have
a
case
where
somebody
came
in
and
answered
to
subpoena
and
said,
i
don't
have
any
books
and
then
he
later
turned
up
with
books,
we
think
that
was
clearly,
that
was
actionable
under
a
lot
of
things
including
this.
so
as
far
as
the
other
provisions
namely
the
violation
of
--
as
to
the
7604
sanction
and
the
7402
sanction
as
with
all
of
which
are
in
the
nature
of
contempt
proceedings
we
–
our
view
is
that
those
apply,
are
applicable
only
for
--
those
sanctions
apply
only
if
the
court
order
has
been
violated.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that
is
our
position.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that
is
our
position.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
our
sovereign
immunity
is
in
the
alternative
in
that
sense,
we
are
--
we
think
that
we
do
rest
on
the
sovereign
immunity
position,
we
don't
think
the
court
had
jurisdiction.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes,
now
this
other
position,
if
i
may
just
take
one
more
minute,
this
other
position
relates
to
the
sovereign
immunity
and
only
this
that
it
shows
what
we
think
that
this
--
that
there
is
no
unconstitutional
summons
here.
there
is
--
that
the
statute
on
its
face
and
as
applied
is
not
an
unconstitutional
because
it
does
not
deprive
anyone
of
the
right
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
or
the
protection
against
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
no
sir,
you
don't
have
to
decide
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
--
but
you
might
have
to
consider
it,
but
you
don't
--
you
have
to
consider
whether
the
threat
of
that
punishment
makes
it
so
severe
--
just
take
it
factually,
peat,
marwick
would
be
so
intimidated
by
the
threat
of
that
statute
that
it
would
sacrifice
the
taxpayer's
privilege
against
self
incrimination
and
we
think
on
these
facts
that
isn't
a
--
that
isn't
a
rational
concern.
we
have
stick
to
--
just
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
we
stipulated
that
we
wouldn't
prosecute
on
the
basis
of
what
we
know.
there
is
a
foot
note
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
correct
in
this
case.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well
that
--
it's
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well
i
have
a
problem
with
justice
black's
question
because
like
when
a
client
asks
you
can
somebody
sue
you,
well
you
can
be
--
somebody
can
sue
you
about
anything.
but
the
indictment
we
think
would
be
susceptible
to
being
dismissed
on
a
demonstration
that
the
answer
--
that
the
refusal
was
because
--
was
the
invoking
of
a
constitutional
privilege.
but
in
this
case
we
don't
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
we
have
conceded
that
we
would
not
indict
on
the
facts
that
appear
here.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
correct.
thank
you.
