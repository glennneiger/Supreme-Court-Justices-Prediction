john
m.
harlan
no
go
ahead
i
--
finish
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
question
i
was
going
to
ask
you
is
this
something
your
premises
as
to
the
invalidity
of
the
subpoenas?
is
this
a
question
of
federal
officer
acting
outside
the
scope
or
his
authority
or
it's
simply
mistaking
his
authority?
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
is
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
statute
gives
an
authority
to
issue
the
subpoena.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
on
the
surface
of
things
at
the
time
he
issued
these
summons,
he
was
acting,
it
would
seem
to
me
within
the
scope
of
statutes
that
gave
him
that
power.
now
he
may
have
said
that,
he
made
this
to
abuse
his
authority
by
doing
something
else,
but
as
far
as
sovereign
immunity
is
concerned
it
seems
to
be
difficult
to
say
that
he
wasn't
acting
originally
within
his
scope
of
his
power?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
although
i
thought
they
were
discharged.
justice
john
m.
harlan
putting
aside
your
unconsented
suit
position
for
the
moment
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
putting
aside
your
unconsented
suit
point
for
a
moment
what
do
you
say
in
mr.
magee's
argument
that
in
this
proceeding
which
you
recognize
is
proper
as
far
as
standing
is
concerned,
this
whole
thing
can
be
thrashed
out
in
a
single
proceeding
whereas
if
you
go
to
enforcement
rule,
he
will
at
least,
his
client,
the
lawyers
and
presumably
the
client
will
be
disadvantaged
in
the
sense
that
they
may
not
have
an
opportunity
to
get
into
such
proceedings
which
i
understand
are
going
forward
or
would
go
forward
in
different
parts
of
the
country.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yeah,
that's
quite
probably.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well.
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
could
sue.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
is
the
administration
of
the
tax
laws
which
of
course
were
scope
of
it,
impeded
by
having
this
thrashed
out
in
the
single
proceeding
as
against
the
enforcement
rule?
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
now
that,
that
--
the
alternatives
are
open
and
then
you
argue
as
a
matter
of
--
in
your
brief
at
least
apart
of
the
un-consented
suit
there
--
this
is
an
exclusive
produce,
the
enforcement
procedure
is
intended
an
exclusive
procedure
by
congress,
is
that
your
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
assuming
that
argument
wasn't
accepted,
and
this
proceeding
is
open,
how
is
the
administration
of
the
tax
laws
affected
adversely
by
following
this
rule
rather
than
the
enforcement
rule?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
enforcement
proceeding.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
issues
are
there
that
would
be
covered
in
this
proceeding?
