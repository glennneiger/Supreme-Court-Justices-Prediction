justice
hugo
l.
black
from
what
case
you
were
reading?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
discovery
against
somebody
other
than
the
defendants.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
to
use
the
fifth
amendment,
the
amendment
says
no
questions
you
will
be
compelled
be
a
witness
against
himself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
the
lawyers
to
take
advantage
of
that
have
to
show
that
they
were
about
to
prosecute
might
terminate
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
privilege,
that's
not
a
constitutional
privilege.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
wouldn't
be
under
the
self
incrimination
amendment.
you
say
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
gather
that
judge
steve
didn't
think
the
proceeding
would
be
that
summary,
he
thought
they
would
have
to
have
a
hearing,
have
to
have
a
chance
to
separate
beside
what
was
privileged
and
what
was
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
federal
--
do
the
statutes
authorizing
administrative
subpoenas
provide
for
immunity
from
punishment
for
a
taxpayer
who
claims
that
it
would
incriminate
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah
the
provision
for
immunity
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
so
that
he
could
be
compelled
to
answer,
to
incriminate
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
sort
of
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
don't
have
to
decide
now
whether
statute
is
valid,
would
authorize
an
indictment
against
them
for
refusing
to
answer
the
administrative
subpoena,
do
we,
we
don't
have
to
decide
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
we
don't
have
to
reach
that.
the
question
i
am
thinking
about
is
this.
let
us
say
that
subpoena
is
answered,
is
filed.
the
man
is
pretty
sure
he
would
have
to
incriminate
himself
if
he
answers
it.
he
doesn't
--
we
don't
have
to
decide
if
he
is
compelled
to
wait.
in
fact
this
case
he
is
compelled
to
wait
he
is
indicted
in
order
to
challenge
that,
so
that
if
he
is
indicted,
he
will
know
his
rights.
it
turns
out
to
be
wrong
then
he
could
be
convicted.
his
first
chance
to
challenge
it
under
those
circumstances
would
be
after
he
is
indicted.
as
i
understand
it,
the
government
has
stipulated
that
it
does
not
intend
to
prosecute
in
this
case
on
any
such
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
don't
have
to
reach
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
case
he
doesn't
imperil
his
chance,
doesn't
get
himself
in
a
position
where
he
could
be
indicted
without
having
a
chance
to
contest
the
validity
of
his
subpoena.
