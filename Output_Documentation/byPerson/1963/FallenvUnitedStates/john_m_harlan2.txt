justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you
are
suggesting
in
this
case,
i
get
it
is
that
there
should
be
a
construction
by
this
court
that
in
the
respect
of
a
prisoner,
an
incarcerated
man,
the
clerk,
the
jailer
in
effect
is
the
clerk.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that
you
think
this
case
are
to
be
remanded
to
find
out
when
the
prisoner
had
exhausted
everything
he
could
do
namely
by
delivering
to
the
jailer
the
notice
of
appeal,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
only
reason
that
you
are
not
ready
to
accept
the
eighth
day
as
is
shown
by
this
record
january
23rd
is
because
i
suppose
the
experience
that
you
had
is
that
prisoner
don't
always
put
on
the
dates
in
the
mailing
if
they
like
(inaudible)
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean
the
facts
are
outside
of
the
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
on
that
premise
why
shouldn't
we
dispose
off
of
the
case
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
willing
to
have,
assume
for
the
purposes
of
the
decision
in
this
case
that
this
letter
was
handed
to
the
jailer
by
this
man
before
january
23.
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
go
back
to
one
thing
again
just
to
make
sure
that
i
understand
it.
you
are
authorized
to
say
for
the
solicitor
general
mr.
heymann
as
i
understand
it
that
for
the
purposes
of
the
disposition
of
this
case
the
government
is
willing
have
the
record
supplemented
by
stipulation
that
this
notice
of
appeal
was
handed
to
the
jailer
on
january
23.
