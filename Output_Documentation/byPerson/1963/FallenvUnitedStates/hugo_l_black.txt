isn't
your
real
(inaudible)
basic
charge
that
a
rule
is
not
a
constitutional
thing
for
this

you
got
have
some
looseness
in
the
joints
to
see
that

do
you
think
in
construing
rule
of
timeliness,
the
court
has
the
right
to
consider
rule
two,
said
that
these
rules
are
intended
to
provide
for
the
just
determination
with
every
criminal
proceedings,
they
should
be
construed
to
secure
simplicity
in
procedure,
fairness
in
administration
and
the
elimination
of
unjustified

was
the
declared
purpose
of
the
rule
in
a
particular
case?

why
didn't
they
know
and
the
system
of
rule
that
and
to
achieve
justice
(inaudible)
this
man's
appeal
should
not
be
cut
off
if
not
why
wouldn't
we
just
be
construing
rules
mechanically
(inaudible)
in
that
regard
of
what
happened.
justice

the
never
be
taken
consideration
anything
is
absolutely
essential
to
produce
that
decision
in
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
it
is
essential
that
a
man
have
an
appeal
and
not
have
it
just
taken
out
of
his
way
and
then
magic
word
jurisdiction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
the
new
rule
says
that
the
defendant
himself
will
be
personally
notified
so
make
sure
that
he
doesn't
have
his
right
of
appeal
taken
away
from
him?

is.
