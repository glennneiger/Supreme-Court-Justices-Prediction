justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
heymann
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
had
filed
a
notice
of
appeal,
one
of
the
perfectly
obvious
was
that
the
man
wanted
to
appeal
and
he
wouldn't
have
a
lawyer.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
general
fact
with
these
lawyers
is
not
to
do
anything
and
just
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trail
and
he
did
say
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
county
clerk
is
supposed
to
think
that
this
lawyer
will
or
won't
take
care
of
these
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
shouldn't
he
file
the
notice
of
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
in
there,
as
a
matter
of
fact
its
â€“
well,
he
probably
won't
have
counsel,
he
was
dead
right,
he
didn't
