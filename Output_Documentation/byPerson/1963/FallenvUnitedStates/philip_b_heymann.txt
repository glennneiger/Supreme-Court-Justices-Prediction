mr.
philip
b.
heymann
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
saying
that
in
the
course
of
preparing
the
oral
argument
we
have
gone
into
some
of
the
background
that
is
not
in
the
record,
appellant's
illness,
of
mail
procedure
and
if
the
court
has
any
questions
they
most
of
the
facts
we
find
turn
out
to
be
favorable
to
appellant,
the
court
feels
it's
appropriate
to
ask,
i'll
be
happy
to
answer.
i
don't
know
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
these
facts
are
not
in
the
record,
i
will
state
the
record
facts
automatically.
i
will
not
state
any
facts
about
atlanta
penitentiary's
mail
procedures
unless
i'm
asked
or
appellant's
illness
unless
i'm
asked.
these
are
not
damaging
facts
to
appellant,
but
i
just
stick
to
the
record
unless
i'm
asked.
i'd
be
happy
to
state
them
if
court's
interested.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
mr.
justice
clark,
the
mail
procedures
today
are
that
the
mail
is
picked
up
five
days
a
week
in
the
federal
penitentiaries.
at
the
time
that
this
case
takes
place,
january
of
1962,
mail
was
picked
up
twice
a
week,
this
is
the
result
of
fairly
offhand
investigation
and
that
time
seems,
this
is
the
atlanta
penitentiary
where
appellant
was,
that
time
seems
to
be
tuesdays
and
fridays.
now,
simple
recourse
to
a
calendar
makes
fallen's
claim
of
timeliness
far
more
plausible
than
it
is
on
the
bare
record.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
january,
january
23rd
the
eight
day
when
he
says
he
mailed
a
letter
was
a
tuesday.
if
he
acted
shortly
after
the
mail
was
picked
up
it
would
not
have
been
removed
from
the
prisoners'
mail
box
until
friday,
it
in
fact
arrived
monday.
now
this
is
entirely
on
the
facts
as
we
now
we
develop
them
if
they
are
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
tuesday
to
friday.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
he
is
a
paraplegic.
he
was
injured
in
an
automobile
racing
accident
in
1951
mr.
chief
justice.
he's
had
because
of
that
something
that's
called
brown-sequard
syndrome
which
is
something
that
paraplegics
often
have,
it's
difficulties
with
the
kidney,
urinary
valve
tracks.
at
the
time
of
this
case,
when
--
at
the
time
of
sentence
and
he
was
immediately
removed
to
the
atlanta
penitentiary
where
he
was
said
he
was
sick,
this
was
primarily
a
bad
case
of
flu.
he
went
to
the
atlanta
penitentiary
with
flu,
and
he
was
put
immediately
in
the
prison
hospital.
there
are
mail
facilities
in
the
prison
hospital.
we
don't
know
whether
the
mail
facilities
give
the
dates
of
pick
up
that
is
tuesday
and
friday.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
no
i
think
he
was
put
in
there
for
having
the
flu,
mr.
chief
justice.
he
has
been
since
transferred
the
springfield,
missouri
where
the
prison
hospital
is
and
that
is
for
being
paraplegic
and
these
are
the
difficulties
that
come
with
that.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
now
that's
one
fact
we
tried
to
find
it
out,
but
we
couldn't
quite
find
out,
the
governments
--
we
couldn't
transcript,
because
the
transcript
wasn't
--
was
never
made
up,
this
having
been
dismissed
on
the
notice
of
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals.
apparently
the
government's
contention
was
that
fallen
was
the
brains
behind
a
hold
up
of
the
post
office
and
that
he
had
in
fact
was
present
at
the
hold
up
in
a
wholly
manually
driven
car,
he
has
no
use
of
his
legs,
either
as
a
getaway
man
or
as
a
simply
an
observer
and
a
look
out.
i
think
i
better
get
to
my
argument.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
right.
now
this
case
of
course
involves
only
one
issue
and
that
is
whether
fallen's
appeal
was
timely
within
the
meaning
of
rule
of
37
(a).
there
are
two
subordinate
questions
under
that.
one
is
whether
fallen
did
everything
that
was
required
of
him
within
the
meaning
of
the
rule,
that
sort
of
the
basic
question.
the
second
question
the
petitioner
has
made
the
basis
of
his
oral
argument
seems
to
me
to
be
something
that
you
only
arrive
at
if
he
didn't
do
everything
he
should
have
and
that
is
whether
what
failures
of
counsel
there
may
have
been
excused
is
not
taking
all
the
actions
he
should
have
taken.
the
basic
facts
have
been
stated
by
mr.
groner,
a
notice
of
appeal
arrived
in
the
district
court
along
with
new
trial
motion
on
the
fourteenth
day
before
a
date
put
on
it
by
the
prisoner
fallen
which
is
the
eighth
day
after
sentence.
he
had
been
represented
by
counsel
through
trial
and
its
sentencing
and
for
that
reason
the
district
court
did
not
advice
him
of
his
right
to
appeal
or
asked
if
he
wanted
an
appeal
noted
forthwith.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i'm
afraid
i
cannot
answer
mr.
chief
justice.
i
can
say
that
i
think
it's
very
general
practice
for
lawyers
appointed
at
trial
to
leave
immediately
after
sentencing
without
taking
the
notice
of
appeals.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
the
new
trial
step
is
almost
automatically
in
the
hands
of
lawyer
appointed
for
the
trial.
a
new
trial
must
be
filed,
a
motion
for
new
trial
must
filed
within
five
days
after
verdict,
not
judgment
since
sentencing
rarely
comes
within
five
days
of
verdict,
prisoners
almost
always
have
--
defendants
almost
always
have
counsel
for
those
five
days
during
which
the
new
trial
motion
must
be
filed.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
doubt
very
much
mr.
justice
goldberg,
just
whether
that
mislead
fallen.
the
reports
of
the
following
conferences
between
fallen
and
his
counsel
indicate
that
he
indicated
to
his
counsel
that
he
would
himself
take
an
appeal,
he
would
himself
obtain
counsel
for
an
appeal.
he
did
in
fact
act
within
as
he
claims
eight
days.
i
doubt
if
he
was
mislead.
there
maybe
some
possibility
there.
i'd
like
to
refer
to
the
basic
question
of
whether
this
appeal
was
timely.
there
are
two
facts,
i
have
stated
the
facts
that
were
here
and
that
were
in
the
record,
mr.
groner
stated
in
too.
the
two
facts
that
in
the
record
that
was
before
the
district
court
and
before
the
court
of
appeals
were
missing.
one
of
those
is
when
fallen
in
fact
gave
his
notice
of
appeal
to
the
prison
authorities
and
another
is
what
he
discussed
with
counsel
during
the
conference
of
an
indeterminate
length
that
took
place
after
sentencing.
the
counsel
said
that
conference
took
an
hour
and
a
half,
fallen
suggested
it
was
few
minutes,
we
have
no
idea
what
was
discussed
there.
now
we
believe
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
yes.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
suppose
there
are
two
answers
mr.
justice
white,
one
is
that
the
clerk
probably
took
quite
seriously
the
language
of
the
rule
that
says
he
shall
only
file
notice
of
appeal
with
his
signature
and
not
with
the
defendant's
signature
if
the
defendant
without
counsel
at
sentencing.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
no,
no.
i
was
suggesting,
i
did
say
that
but
i
was
suggesting
that
generally
the
defendant
very
regularly
the
defendant
files
a
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
the
clerk?
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
suppose
he
should
think
that
the
lawyer
will
not.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
because
he
is
only
authorized
to
sign
a
notice
of
appeal
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
when
it's
been
â€“
when
he
is
not
represented
by
counsel.
now
this
may
not
be
--
this
may
be
an
overly
technical
reading
of
the
rule,
but
that's
probably
the
way
he
read
it.
i
have
a
second
answer
and
that
is
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
don't
really
want
to
be
pressed
too
far
on
what
the
clerk
thought
about
fallen's
counsel.
the
counsel
was
there.
the
clerk
saw
fallen
with
a
counsel.
that's
probably
all
he
saw.
also
i
don't
think
it's
clear
from
fallen's
question
that
he
wanted
to
appeal.
he
wanted
to
know
if
he
could
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
if
he
wanted
to,
and
the
answer
was
yes.
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
that
there
are
four
rules
that
state
the
time
within
which
a
prisoner
must
act
and
the
actions
he
must
take
to
file
a
timely
appeal
within
rule
37
(a).
rule
37
(a)
says
an
appeal
should
be
taken
within
10
days.
only
one
of
these
do
we
believe
could
be
decided
on
the
record
that
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
that
construction
of
rule
37
(a)
is
the
one
adopted
by
the
fifth
circuit.
it
said
the
notice
of
appeal
must
arrive
in
being
the
clerk's
constructive
or
actual
possession
within
10
days.
now,
that
is
an
entirely
reasonable
construction
we
believe
in
the
case
of
everyone
except
prisoners.
the
rule
itself
says
an
appeal
was
taken
by
fallen
in
notice
with
the
clerk
and
shall
be
taken
within
10
days
that
seems
to
mean
that
the
notice
shall
be
filed
within
10
days.
this
is
the
general
rule
for
civil
cases.
it's
also
a
rule
that
gives
maximum
of
certainty
and
that
maybe
the
most
important
characteristic
of
a
rule
for
appeals
so
that
everyone
would
know
when
the
criminal
prosecution
is
over.
we
did
not
defend
that
judgment
in
our
memorandum
on
the
cert
petition
and
we
don't
defend
it
now
for
the
reason
that
was
simply
stated
by
judge
shawn
in
a
case
for
himself
in
the
two
judge
hands.
the
prisoner's
right
to
appeal
cannot
be
left
in
the
hands
of
his
jailer.
it's
one
thing
to
say
to
an
ordinary
defendant
who
is
out
of
bail
or
who
has
counsel
that
he
has
an
absolute
obligation
of
getting
his
notice
of
appeal
to
the
court
within
10
days,
all
he
has
to
do
is
write
a
letter
and
say
i
want
to
appeal.
he
has
that
power
and
having
the
power,
it
can
be
required
of
him.
the
robinson
case
that
neglect
in
taking
his
action
is
not
excusable.
it's
an
entirely
different
thing
to
say
that
to
a
prisoner
who
is
a
penitentiary
behind
bars.
he
has
no
power
to
get
his
notice
for
appeal
to
the
court.
he
is
required
to
use
a
courier
and
he
can't
choose
his
courier,
his
only
courier
is
his
jailer,
the
government
which
succeeded
in
obtaining
the
prosecution.
for
that
reason
we
think
that
timeliness
of
appeal
for
a
prisoner
must
be
decided
by
when
he
takes
an
action
within
his
power
that
is
when
he
gives
the
notice
for
appeal
to
the
prison
authorities
for
forwarding.
now,
that's
the
very
when,
that's
the
very
when
that
we
don't
think
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
and
that's
the
reason
why
we
believe
a
remand
is
necessary
and
a
hearing.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
mr.
chief
justice,
the
district
court,
no
one
has
ever
had
anything
on
this
issue
except
the
statement
of
the
defendant,
the
date
that
the
defendant
wrote
at
the
top
of
his
notice
of
appeal
which
was
the
eighth
day.
we
can't
accept
a
defendant
--
a
prisoner's
notation
of
a
date
on
a
letter
as
the
date
on
which
it's
forwarded.
in
going
through
the
cases
i
ran
across
a
couple
of
cases
in
which
appeals
were
denied
months
later
by
courts
of
appeals.
they
had
been
dated
by
the
prisoner
well
within
the
10-day
period.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
there
is
not
--
there
was
not
apparently,
there
certainly
isn't
in
this
case.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
there
is
not.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
there
is
two
types
of
prison
mail,
one
will
be
dated
that's
special
purpose
mail,
the
other
is
uncensored
mail
and
it
will
not
be
dated
and
that's
what
was
used
in
this
case.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
the
envelope
contains
no
notation
of
date,
it
contains
no
stamp,
i
think
it
â€“
that's
right
it's
franked.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
it's
cracked.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well
â€“
[laughter]
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well,
i
was
about
to
come
to
that.
on
the
question
â€“
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
no
on
the
question
of
when
he
deposited
them.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
now
we
don't
think
that's
sufficient
for
a
decision
of
this
case,
with
the
case
here
we
think
the
court
should
tell
the
district
court
what
date
would
be
timely
and
what
would
not.
in
other
words,
it
shouldn't
simply
go
back
to
find
out
when.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
agree
that
he
states
that
very
clearly
mr.
justice
goldberg.
this
is
a
decision
that
has
to
be
made
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
district
judge
properly
makes
it
in
the
first
instance
in
determining
whether
to
grant
leave
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
that's
clearly
right.
in
that
way
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
overturn
judge
simpson's
decision.
we
do
think
that
court
of
appeals
has
the
right
to
make
that
finding
of
timeliness
and
it's
never
been
faced
with
question
also
as
the
right
to
send
it
back
for
hearing.
we
discussed
in
our
brief
three
alternatives
we
thought
which
could
state
the
time
when
a
prisoner
must
do
everything
within
his
power
to
get
a
notice
of
appeal
to
the
court.
one
would
be
to
require
him
to
act
and
exercise
all
due
care
in
light
of
the
delays
that
prison
mails
often
have.
well,
today
they
don't
have
any
delays,
but
in
those
days
they
were
delivered
twice
a
week,
there
could
have
been
a
delay
of
several
days.
we
haven't
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
think
that
construing
in
light
of
rule
two
would
be
a
perfect
disposition
of
this
case
on
the
issue
of
timeliness
of
a
prisoner's
appeal
mr.
justice
black.
the
--
i
started
to
say
that
we
don't
recommend
that
the
defendant
here
required
to
take
due
care
in
light
of
prison
procedures
for
two
reasons.
one
is
we
think
a
notice
of
appeal
rule
should
be
as
mechanical
and
as
certain
as
possible
due
care
may
involve
litigation
that
would
certainly
be
obnoxious
to
the
prisoner,
the
prosecutor,
and
the
court.
we
discussed
two
other
rules
either
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
mr.
justice
black
i
think
you
are
too,
i
am
not
quite,
i
can't
separate
two
questions
you
maybe
asking.
one
in
light
of
the
facts
that
i
have
given
you
were
not
in
the
record
and
were
not
before
the
court
of
appeals,
i
would
not
think
it
was
beyond
the
bounds
of
reason
for
this
court
to
say
that
he
in
fact
appealed
on
the
eighth
day.
i
would
think
that
would
be
permissible.
these
facts
were
not
before
the
court
of
appeals,
but
they
are,
we
have
checked
them
and
that's
what
seems
to
have
happened.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
that's
the
second
question.
as
to
the
second
question,
a
rule
of
time
the
appeal
has
to
be
arbitrary.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
because
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
am
sure
if
there
is
something
essential
to
produce
a
fair
result,
perhaps
it
must
be
taken
into
consideration.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well
i
think
that
is
the,
i
think
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
robinson.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
also
think
it's
probably
correct.
the
--
a
court
of
appeals
--
there
should
be
a
termination
date
for
a
criminal
proceeding.
there
should
be
a
date
at
which
everyone
can
say
this
proceeding
is
over
or
i
should
add
mr.
justice
that
the
proposed
new
rules
would
allow
an
extension
of
30
days
for
excusable
neglect.
it
doesn't,
if
they
want,
if
the
date
is
10
days
plus
30
days
for
excusable
neglect
then
40
days
is
the
date
when
everybody
knows
that
it's
over,
but
i
do
believe
there
should
be
a
rule
and
i
think
we
both
agree
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
there
is
your
honor.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
these
are
--
i
am
talking
about
proposal.
i
am
talking
about
proposed
new
rules,
your
honor
will
be
the
ones
who
promulgate
these
roles.
the
present
proposals
state
that
and
these
of
course
can
be
changed
before
they
get
here,
the
present
proposal
states
that
the
district
court
should
tell
every
defendant,
not
just
defendants
without
counsel,
and
not
just
indigent
defendants
of
their
right
to
appeal
and
should
offer
each
of
them
the
services
of
the
district
court
clerk
in
entering
the
appeal.
we
would
think
that
if
that
was
construed
or
amended
so
that
the
district
court
would
make
clear
that
if
the
defendant
did
not
avail
himself
of
these
services
at
once
he
had
10
days
to
write
a
letter
to
the
clerk
or
to
get
a
letter
to
the
clerk,
telling
him
he
wants
this
appeal
noted
now,
we
would
think
that
would
completely
dispose
of
the
counsel
question
for
all
future
cases,
without
completely
disposing
the
questions
presented
in
this
case,
the
rules
could
and
would
take
care
of
it.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
that
is
exactly
what
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
that's
correct
and
i
would
think
would
be
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
that's
it
and
it
would
be
minor
qualification
that
we
think
that
a
remand
is
desirable
because
of
the
facts
that
were
before
the
court
of
appeals.
it
would
--
if
the
facts
that
are
now
before
this
court
had
been
the
court
of
appeals
would
perhaps
be
quite
possible
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
it
without
a
hearing
forth
with.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
this
fact
is
outside
of
the
record.
it's
that
these
facts
are
outside
of
the
record,
which
caused
this
initially
to
recommend
a
remand
and
causes
us
now
to
say
it's
the
more
formally
proper
disposition
of
the
case,
but
the
basic
part
of
what
is
said
is
exactly
what
i
would
say,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
--
these
facts
were
arrived
at
a
somewhat
offhand
basis,
but
i
would
think
there
was
nothing
seriously
wrong
with
disposing
of
it
up
here,
primarily
because
there
has
been
a
substantial
delay
between
the
time
of
the
notice
of
appeal
and
the
present
time,
the
time
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
we
do
not
know
it.
that's
what
we've
always
said,
there
should
be
a
hearing
on,
but
i
have
said
to
this
court
that
there
is
a
consistency
between
a
tuesday
and
friday
date
of
pickups
in
prison
and
fallen's
contention
that
he
deposited
the
letter
on
tuesday
and
it
didn't
derive
till
the
following
monday.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
think
the
evidence
is
quite
strong.
i
still
think
the
better
disposition
would
probably
be
for
a
finding
by
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
district
court,
but
i
think
the
evidence
is
quite
strong
now.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
he
in
fact
says
he
thought
it
on
the
eighth
day,
that's
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
now
that's,
well
friday
will
be
the
next
day
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
think
we
would
have
to
rely
primarily
on
the
defendant
himself
at
this
stage.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well
we
would
ask
him,
apparently
the
pick
up
was
--
i
am
afraid,
as
i
say
this,
we
tell
them
what
he
is
going
to
say,
the
pick
up
is
apparently
shortly
after
noon,
it
was
time
tuesday
and
friday
we
would
have
asked
when
he
deposited
it
and
i
am
sure
that
now
it
will
turn
out
right.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
we
would
be
your
honor,
if
it
were
clear
in
the
court's
opinion
that
there
is
not
a
rule
that
prisoners
can
write
any
date
they
want
on
the
top
of
a
notice
of
appeal
and
have
that
accepted
by
the
courts.
we
think
that
the
facts
here
are
extraordinary.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
he
does,
we
wouldn't
like
to
rely
on
even
his
statements
in
that
form.
we
would
like
to
have
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well
i
meant
to
say
that
that
the
prisoner
now
stands,
this
is
another
advantage
of
the
rule
suggested
by
justice
harlan,
that
if
he
acted
within
10
days,
he
could
use
the
prison
authorities
as
his
clerk.
the
mail
is
now
picked
up
on
a
five-day
a
week
basis,
monday
through
friday
and
when
it's
forwarded,
which
is
presumably
the
same
day
it
is
stamped
with
a
date
even
if
the
franking
privilege
is
used.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
unless,
yes
your
honor,
unless
united
states
attorney
has
more
imagination
than
i
have
on
what
could
be
brought
up.
i
thought
that
i
have
had
trouble
thinking
of
what
could
he
possibly
bring
out.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
think
so
your
honor,
yes.
now
i
think
at
this
point
the
last
thing
i
have
to
say
becomes
rather
obvious
and
that
is
that
it
seems
to
us
every
reason
not
to
decide
a
right
for
counsel
question
in
this
case.
the
government
believes
that
if
felon
is
telling
the
truth
his
notice
of
appeal
is
timely.
even
a
felon
is
not
telling
the
truth,
whatever
loss
may
have
come
to
him
from
and
absence
of
counsel
which,
which
does
not
appear,
we
don't
know
what
counsel
said
to
him,
we
would
have
that
remand
on
that,
for
whatever
loss
may
have
come
to
him
from
the
absence
of
counsel
would
be,
we
believe
made
up
by
the
fifth
circuit's
later
decision
in
flora
which
says
the
10-day
rule
doesn't
begin
to
run,
until
the
prisoner
is
informed
by
court
or
counsel.
so
fallen
is
protected,
coming
and
going
on
the
counsel
point,
on
the
timeliness
of
this
appeal
on
the
counsel
point.
as
to
future
cases,
we
believe
that
the
pending
revision
of
the
rules
is
a
far
superior
place
to
go
into
this
question.
it's
been
going
into
in-depth
now.
i
wanted
to
mention
three
rules
i
think
i
have
mentioned
two
of
them,
one
is
that
the
district
court
would
be
(inaudible)
proposals,
one
is
the
district
court
would
be
required
to
inform
every
defendant
of
his
right
to
appeal
and
to
ask
every
defendant
if
the
clerk
were
to
make
available
to
every
defendant
the
services
of
the
clerk
in
noting
the
appeal
immediately,
another
is
the
provision
for
30
days
for
excusable
neglect,
and
third
is
a
proposed
revision
of
the
rules
for
counsel.
the
new
rules
would
make
clear
that
counsel
stayed
with
them
all
the
time
through
i
think.
there
are
two
bills
now
before
congress
that
are
in
conference
that
would
make
that
clear,
and
these
are
the
places
for
disclosing
of
a
counsel
issue.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
yes,
your
honor
and
unless
the
court
has
any
other
questions
i
will
leave
it
there.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
think
it
will
be
better
perhaps
to
decide
it
now.
the
only
service
would
be
that
it
would
make
clear
that
the
general
--
the
general
disposition
of
these
cases
that
is
most
appropriate
is
a
hearing
in
effect
finding
by
district
judge.
if
that
can
be
made
clear
without
sending
it
back
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
purpose
in
sending
it
back.
