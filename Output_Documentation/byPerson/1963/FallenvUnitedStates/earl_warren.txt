fallen,
petitioner,
versus
united
states.
mr.
groner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
that
fact
that
he
could
no
longer
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
groner
is
there
any
rule
of
that
district
court
stating
the
time
that
the
appointment
to
represent
a
defendant
that
his
trail
terminates?
in
other
words
after
he
was
sentenced,
was
this
lawyer
obligated
to
represent
him
or
had
he,
had
he
fulfilled
his
obligation
of
assignment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
perhaps
the
government
can
answer
that
question,
i'll
ask
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
i
understand
this
is
man
was
a
paraplegic?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
of
that
he
was
sent
to
the
prisoner
hospital
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
nature
of
his
confinement
in
the
hospital
that
would
militate
against
his
filing
the
notice
of
appeal,
do
you
know
if
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
his
point
first
raised
by
the
government,
the
question
is
to
whether
district
court
had
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
matter?
did
they
raise
it
in
the
district
court
or
did
they
raise
it
first
in
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
heymann.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
they
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
illness?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
was
put
in
there
for
being
ill
and
not
just
because
he
paraplegic?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
heymann,
can
you
answer
the
question
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
asked
mr.
groner
is
to
what
is
the
length
of
the
service
of
a
lawyer
who
is
appointed
to
defend
a
man
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
before
the
--
the
district
court,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
is
suppose
if
it
went
back
and
all,
you
did
was
to
ask
him
these
questions
and
he
answered
them
favorable
to
himself,
the
court
would
be
obliged
to
--
on
not
having
relief
would
it
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
this
would
be
useless
procedure
limit
in
the
long
run?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
groner,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah,
go
right
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
groner
before
you
will
take
your
seat
on
behalf
of
the
court
i
should
like
to
thank
you
for
having
accepted
the
assignment
to
represent
this
indigent
defendant.
the
court
is
always
comforted
by
the
fact
that
lawyers
will
accept
such
public
service
and
so
we
are
very
grateful
to
you.
and
mr.
heymann,
i
want
to
say
to
you
that
the
court
is
really
appreciative
of
the
frankness
and
fairness
in
this
case.
i
think
it's
a
matter
we
can
all
derive
pleasure
out
of
in
this
last
argued
case

term
have
an
end
on
a
high
note

as
frank
to
the
court
and
as
fair
to
each
other
as
you

been
in
this
case,
both
of
you.
we'll
adjourn.
