mr.
isaac
n.
groner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
which
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
is
the
validity
under
the
constitution
under
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedures,
of
the
action
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
granting
the
motion
of
the
government
to
dismiss
the
appeal
on
the
ground
that
no
notice
of
appeal
had
been
received
by
the
district
court
within
10
days
after
petitioner's
sentencing.
petitioner
was
convicted
on
three
counts
arising
out
of
a
post
office
robbery,
upon
a
trial
in
which
he
was
represented
by
court
appointed
counsel.
on
january
15,
1962,
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
consecutive
terms
aggregating
20
years.
the
court
appointed
counsel
was
physically
present
at
the
sentencing.
the
record
of
the
sentencing
shows
that
petitioner
himself
asked
the
court
“may
i
appeal
this
case
as
an
insolvent?”
the
district
court
replied,
“oh
yes,
you
always
have
a
right
to
appeal.
the
government
provides
for
that.”
thereupon
the
sentencing
proceeding
was
terminated.
after
the
sentencing,
petitioner
and
his
court
appointed
counsel
had
a
talk.
the
record
before
this
court
contains
letters
from
both
the
counsel
and
the
petitioner
relating
to
this
conversation.
the
counsel's
letter
contains
the
following.
at
that
time
i
told
mr.
fallen
that
the
firm
with
which
i
am
associated,
did
not
wish
me
to
undertake
any
further
criminal
matters
either
by
appeal
or
otherwise
and
therefore
i
suggested
that
mr.
fallen
secure
another
attorney
without
delay
so
as
not
to
forfeit
his
right
of
appeal.
counsel
then
departed
out
of
the
case
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
at
that
time.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
he
did
not
notify
the
court
your
honor
that
he
was
withdrawing
so
far
as
this
record
was
concerned.
in
fact
your
honor
he
was
reappointed
under
the
circumstances,
i'll
come
to
shortly,
which
indicates
very
clearly
that
the
court
recognized
the
propriety,
evidently
under
the
terms
of
its
original
appointment
of
his
disassociating
himself
from
petitioner
at
this
point.
there
is
no
indication
that
there
was
any
other
communication
with
the
district
court
after
this
conversation
by
the
counsel
until
he
was
reappointed.
on
january
29,
the
fourteenth
day
subsequent
to
petitioner's
sentencing,
the
district
court
received
two
letters,
each
dated
january
23,
written
by
petitioner,
the
one
constituting
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
the
other
a
notice
of
appeal.
these
then
were
the
first
papers
received
by
the
district
court
subsequent
to
the
sentencing,
so
that
prior
to
january
29
and
between
january
15
and
january
29,
there
was
no
communication
with
the
district
court
by
the
petitioner
or
by
his
court
appointed
counsel.
petitioner
had
been
incarcerated
during
the
trial
in
jacksonville,
florida
where
the
trial
took
place.
the
day
following
his
sentencing,
he
was
removed
to
the
hospital
at
the
federal
penitentiary
in
atlanta
and
it
was
from
the
federal
penitentiary
that
the
letters
were
transmitted
to
the
district
court.
on
january
30,
the
day
after
the
letters
were
received,
pursuant
to
a
request
from
the
district
court,
the
court
appointed
counsel
sent
a
letter
to
the
court,
summarizing
the
facts
to
which
i
have
already
referred.
on
february
1
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes,
yes
your
honor.
the
fact
that
he
had
told
petitioner
that
he
and
petitioner
had
had
a
conversation
subsequent
to
the
sentencing,
that
he
had
told
petitioner
that
his
firm
did
not
permit
him
or
would
not
permit
him
to
undertake
any
further
criminal
matters
and
that
petitioner
ought
to
do
something
else
about
getting
another
attorney.
on
february
1,
the
district
court
filed
an
order
which
expressly
reappointed
this
court
appointed
counsel
as
counsel
for
the
limited
purpose
of
presenting
the
question
whether
petitioner's
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
timely
filed,
and
if
so
whether
it
should
be
granted.
the
district
court
found,
in
this
order,
that
while
appeal
was
discussed
on
january
15
with
mr.
fallen,
the
provisions
of
the
rules
with
respect
to
new
trial
were
not
discussed
with
him,
nor
the
requirements
of
law
with
respect
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis.
the
district
court
found
that
the
representation
of
petitioner
by
court
appointed
counsel
had
ended
on
the
date
of
the
sentencing.
under
these
circumstances,
it
is
undoubtedly
an
undeniably
the
fact
that
this
court
appointed
counsel
took
no
action
and
felt
himself
under
no
assignment
or
responsibility
to
the
petitioner
with
respect
to
either
the
motion
for
new
trial
or
the
notice
of
appeal.
this
counsel
does
not
claim
that
he
advised
petitioner
as
to
the
time
limits,
specified
in
the
rule.
nor
does
he
claim
that
he
provided
petitioner
with
any
assistance
whatsoever.
the
record
before
the
court
is
sufficiently
complete
to
be
absolutely
clear
and
unquestionable
that
this
court
appointed
counsel
did
not
represent
petitioner
and
did
not
afford
him
the
assistance
of
counsel
at
any
time
during
the
10-day
period
subsequent
to
the
sentencing
or
at
any
time
prior
to
his
being
reappointed
by
the
court.
on
february
21,
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
the
merits.
it
expressly
did
not
decide
the
issue
of
timeliness.
on
the
same
day,
the
court
appointed
counsel
filed
the
formal
notice
of
appeal
and
the
requisite
papers
for
appeal
as
an
indigent.
on
february
26,
such
an
appeal
was
allowed
by
the
district
court.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
after
the
government
had
filed
its
motion
to
dismiss,
another
counsel
was
appointed
to
represent
petitioner
for
the
purpose
of
the
government's
motion.
the
court
granted
the
motion
and
dismissed
the
appeal
by
a
two
to
one
vote.
the
majority
found
that
the
petitioner
had
raised
no
constitutional
issues,
but
judge
reese,
in
dissent,
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
defendant
did
not
have
counsel
of
his
own
choice
or
court
appointed
counsel
throughout
the
10-day
period
allowed
for
filing
his
notice
of
appeal,
that
he
was
not
adequately
advised
of
his
rights,
was
recognized
by
the
district
court.
upon
these
facts,
petitioner's
first
contention
here
is
that
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
cannot
stand
because
it
is
in
violation
of
petitioner's
right
to
counsel.
this
appeal
was
dismissed
on
the
basis
of
papers
filed
by
petitioner
himself
without
the
assistance
of
counsel
during
the
time
when
he
had
no
court
appointed
counsel
and
when
he
had
not
waved,
in
any
way,
his
right
to
counsel.
here
we
are
dealing
with
the
federal
system
where
as
this
court
had
pointed
out
in
hardy
against
the
united
states,
the
appeal
is
a
matter
of
right
and
where
the
appellant
is
entitled
to
the
aid
of
counsel
unless
he
insists
on
being
his
own.
the
cases
of
this
court
in
our
view,
leaves
no
room
for
doubt
that
the
right
to
counsel
under
the
constitution
as
well
as
the
federal
statues
and
rules
extends
to
trails
on
the
one
hand
and
to
appeals
on
the
other.
a
court
may
not
constitutionally
convict
if
the
defendant
has
been
deprived
of
his
right
to
counsel
at
the
trial
and
appellate
court
may
not
constitutionally
affirm
if
the
appellant
has
been
deprived
of
his
right
to
counsel
on
appeal.
it
clearly
follows
that
an
appellate
court
may
not
dismiss
the
appeal
if
the
appellant
has
been
deprived
of
right
to
counsel
in
the
submission
of
the
appeal
papers.
this
case
itself
is
a
most
eloquent
illustration
and
demonstration
of
the
consequences
of
failing
to
accord
the
right
of
counsel,
during
the
period
immediately
after
the
sentencing.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
during
the
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well
that,
we
would
summarize
the
facts
your
honor
as
showing
that
he
did
not
have
counsel.
now
the
exact
state
of
the
appointment
of
counsel
is
not
indicated
in
the
record.
there
is
no
appointment
of
counsel
either
by
a
document
or
by
an
oral
statement
of
the
court.
the
fact
is
that
he
departed
from
the
petitioner's
subsequent
attempting
and
the
fact
is
that
he
was
reappointed
by
the
court.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
the
intervening
papers
with
the
letters
that
are
involved,
the
letters
of
january
23rd,
your
honor,
and
in
one
of
them
the
one
letter
goes,
“since
i
haven't
heard
from
the
lawyer
i
would
like
for
this
letter
to
ask
for
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
the
basis
of
the
new
trial
is
that
the
trial
judge
in
his
charge
to
the
jury,
also
the
evidence
did
not
warrant
conviction
on
those
charges.”
the
other
letter
read,
“i
would
like
to
appeal
the
court's
decision
in
my
case.
i
would
like
to
get
the
court
record
as
pauper.
since
i
haven't
heard
from
the
lawyer
to
return
to
the
first
letter,
this
is
the,
again
the
letter
dated
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
no,
this
is
not
such
a
situation.
on
the
other
hand,
your
honor
this
is
a
situation
where
petitioner
is
confined
to
a
wheel
chair,
where
he
was
confined
under
guard
in
a
hospital
during
the
trail
at
jacksonville
florida.
this
conversation
that
we
are
speaking
of,
took
place
on
january
the
15th,
the
very,
his
own
statement
indicate
that
subsequent
to
this
conversation
he
was
taken
back
to
the
jacksonville
hospital,
not
permitted
to
have
visited.
the
record
shows
that
on
the
very
next
day,
he
was
transported
by
the
government
from
jacksonville
to
atlanta
and
the
record
indicates
from
his
statements
that
he
was
ill
and
it
was
in
the
hospital
at
atlanta
and
that
the
first
day
that
he
felt
well
enough
to
write,
he
did
write
the
letter
on
january
23rd
and
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
that
is
correct.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now
the
only
reply
to
the
extent
that
i
understand
the
government's
position
is
that
the
record
does
not
disclose
with
a
certainty
or
with
that
increased
certainty
that
would
accompany
a
remand
that
the
letter
was
mailed
on
the
january
23rd,
i
am
sure
that
the
government
can
express
its
own
position.
what
is
indicated
in
the
record
is
a
statement
by
petitioner
that
he
did
deposit
the
letter
in
the
hospital,
prison
hospital
mail
box
on
january
the
23.
the
record
also
indicates
that
the
district
court
assumed
that
the
letters
had
been
mailed
or
at
least
that
the
petitioner
had
made
evidence
a
desire
for
a
new
trail,
asked
for
an
appeal
on
the
eighth
day.
the
government
without
indicating
in
anyway
on
what
bases
it
speculation
or
its
position
indicates
that
the
case
ought
to
be
remanded
--
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
was
very
interested
in
sitting
and
listening
to
the
previous
case,
that
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
testimony
after
the
event
did
not
have
to
be
helpful,
and
he
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
such
testimony
is
have
to
be
highly
speculative
and
that
those
involved
would
be
very,
would
be
very
likely
to
try
to
defend
what
they
have
done.
and
we
submit
that
that
would
certainly
happen
on
this
point,
would
there
be
a
remand
on
whether
or
not
the
letter
was
mailed.
but
in
any
event,
your
honors,
our
primary
thrust
here
is
on
the
right
to
counsel
and
as
to
that
there
is
not
dispute
in
the
record,
there
can
be
no
material
fact
to
be
explored
upon
any
remand.
and
we
would
submit
to
your
honors
that
had
the
court
appointed
counsel
promptly,
had
he
felt
that
he
was
under
a
continuing
obligation
under
a
continuing
responsibility
and
had
he
filed
within
time
the
very
notice
of
appeal
and
other
appeal
papers
which
he
later
filed
after
reappointment
by
the
court,
this
case
would
of
course
have
long
since
disposed
up
on
its
merit.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
well,
that
certainly
is
a
position,
that
one
of
the
positions
that
we
take.
there
is
no
question
about
it
and
we
would
strongly
submit
your
honor
that
is
a
case
which
very
dramatically
and
forcefully
illustrates
that
there
must
be
some
plan
to
join.
the
special
factors
here
including
the
absence
of
the
right
of
counsel,
including
the
writing
and
mailing
of
the
letters
within
time
although
we
seek
by
the
district
court
outside
of
time
and
the
action
or
inaction
by
the
district
court
all
add
up
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
very
unjust
to
deprive
this
appellant
of
the
right
of
appeal
and
even
the
majority
below
were
moved
in
what
i
at
least
say
as
a
very
unusual
expression.
they
were
moved
to
express
their
sympathy
with
this
defendant
and
certainly
i
would
think
that
they
would
not
express
sympathy
unless
they
felt
absolutely
ironbound
by
a
rule
of
law.
we
certainly
submit
that
they
are
not
to
have
so
felt
that
the
rules
involved,
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
there
are
rules
which
do
permit
some
flexibility
for
the
obviously
exceptional
case.
now
we
would
submit
on
the
right
to
counsel,
that
the
right
to
counsel
extends
to
all
the
stages
of
the
criminal
proceeding,
that
the
concept
of
right
to
counsel
is
that
there
is
a
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
unless
there
is
knowing
waiver
of
that
right
we
would
submit
that,
under
the
sixth
amendment,
under
rule
44
that
there
is
with
absolutely
clarity
that
the
right
extends
to
all
stages,
this
is
the
phrasing
of
rule
44,
but
there
is
no
need
to
show
prejudice
although
of
course
in
this
case
there
was
prejudice
and
that
if
this
right
does
apply
on
all
stages,
the
record
is
clear
that
at
this
particular
stage
and
this
particular
case
that
right
was
denied,
and
therefore
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
yes
your
honor,
he
was
paraplegic
confined
to
two
wheeled
chair
throughout
and
still
is.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i
believe
so
your
honor
and
also
because
of
that
he
had
been
under
confinement
even
during
the
trial
in
a
local
hospital
in
jacksonville,
florida.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
there
is
no
other
fact
that
i
can
recall
expect
for
his
own
statement
that
he
was
too
ill
to
write
until
january
23rd,
but
beyond
that
as
to
the
details
of
--
the
record
contains
for
example
no
medical
reports
that
i'm
aware
of
or
anything
like
that.
but
it
does
contain
a
statement
as
far
as
i
know
what
is
un-contradicted,
that
he
was
too
ill
to
write
until
january
23,
as
well
as
the
fact
that
immediately
after
the
sentencing
in
jacksonville
he
was
not
permitted
any
visitors.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
i'm
not
sure.
i
believe
that
they
contested
the
motion
for
new
trial,
the
timeliness
of
it
before
the
district
judge
and
he
did
not
pass
on
the
timeliness
of
it,
although
he
did
pass
on
the
merits
of
it.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
thank
you.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
just
one
or
two
things
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
n.
groner
just
so
the
formalities
maybe
tidied
up
and
however
naked
my
motivation
may
now
be,
certainly
petitioner
would
stipulate
to
the
facts
which
have
been
added
here
by
the
representative
of
the
solicitor
general.
we
would
stipulate
that
they
ought
to
be
and
shall
be
considered
part
of
the
record
before
the
court
and
of
course
we
would
agree
with
the
conclusion
which
of
course
we
agreed
with
before
that
there
now
can
be
no
doubt
whatsoever
that
on
the
eighth
day,
this
petitioner
did
deposit
in
the
mail
this
notice
of
appeal.
and
so
on
the
first
ground
we
think
now
it
conceded
on
the
first
ground
in
terms
of
what
we
argued
in
our
brief,
it
is
now
conceded
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
it
maybe
stipulated
that
he
deposited
on
the
eighth
day,
we
believe
therefore
that
on
that
ground
the
court
should
hold
that
he
has
done
all
that
he
can
do
and
therefore
should
reverse
the
judgment.
on
the
right
to
counsel
point,
however
we
do
believe
that
there
are
or
might
be
some
utility
in
the
court
discussing
that.
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
need
for
remand.
it
is
absolutely
clear
whatever
was
said
between
them
that
the
counsel
did
not
act
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
and
the
petitioner
has
not
waved
his
right
to
counsel
and
we
would
therefore
say
that
the
right
to
counsel
has
been
violated.
the
notes
to
the
new
rules
use
the
same
phrase
at
all
stages
that
rule
44
does
and
so
we
would
say
it
is
the
present
rules
that
we
are
concerned
with,
and
rules
44
guarantee
that
there
would
be
in
fact
available
the
assistance
of
counsel
at
all
stages.
and
we
certainly
would
join
the
government
in
commending
to
your
honors
the
case
of
boroff
against
the
united
states.
now,
we
certainly
would
agree
that
the
reasoning
of
that
case
is
a
persuasive
guide
to
the
principles
which
ought
to
apply
here.
now,
there
is
one
further
point
because
there
were
questions
asked
by
justices
goldberg
and
white
at
least
with
respect
to
the
duty
of
the
judge
except
that
the
answers
or
the
discussion
seems
to
be
the
context
of
the
duty
of
the
clerk.
our
position
is
that
it's
a
duty
devolves
upon
the
judge
and
if
the
judge
was
put
on
notice
here
that
the
petitioner
wanted
to
appeal,
rule
37
(a)
(2)
as
it
now
stand
says,
that
when
a
court
after
trial
imposes
sentence
upon
a
defendant
not
represented
by
counsel
the
defendant
shall
be
advised
of
his
right
to
appeal
and
if
he
so
requests
the
clerk
shall
prepare
and
file
forth
with
a
notice
of
appeal
on
behalf
of
the
defendant.
we
say
that
that
imposes
an
obligation
upon
the
court
and
that
that
obligation
was
not
satisfied
here.
we
don't
construe
that
rule
as
bearing
upon
the
authorization
of
the
clerk
as
the
government
does.
we
think
it
bears
upon
the
obligation
of
the
court
and
the
court
obviously
did
not
satisfy
it
here.
for
those
reasons
and
for
the
reasons
that
the
rules
ought
generally
to
be
interpreted
so
as
to
do
justice,
we
would
strongly
urge
the
court
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed
and
that
the
case
be
remanded
not
for
any
further
hearing
whatsoever,
but
with
directions
to
reinstate
the
appeal
and
to
decide
the
appeal
on
it's
merits.
