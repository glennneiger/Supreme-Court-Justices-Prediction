mr.
joseph
kovner
if
it
please
the
court.
the
government's
position
in
this
case
can
be
summarized,
i
think,
shortly
in
three
or
four
propositions.
the
first
one
is
that
as
a
matter
of
legal
precedent
and
prior
authority,
this
case
is
on
all
force
with
behrens.
there
is
no
distinction.
in
fact
that
in
behrens,
the
unrecorded
federal
tax
lien
here
arose
before
the
bank
made
its
loan
is
immaterial
because
the
lien
as
against
the
bank
can
become
effective
until
it
was
recorded.
and
the
behrens'
opinion
makes
it
quite
clear,
explicitly
clear
that
the
cases
to
be
treated
as
one
in
which
there
is
a
prior
lien
in
favor
of
the
bank
for
a
loan
made
by
a
bank
against
the
security
of
an
insurance
policy.
so
that
the
behrens
case
is
--
is
merely
in
point
and
is
the
decided
law
prior
to
the
case
coming
here
that
was
relied
upon
by
the
court
below,
it
was
also
relied
upon
by
the
sixth
circuit,
the
recent
case
went,
which
is
pending
on
certiorari
--
petition
for
certiorari.
so
the
question
is
whether
behrens
was
wrong
or
right.
we
think
it's
right.
we
think
the
case
is
clearly
stated
by
judge
learned
hand,
when
he
points
out
that
when
you
come
to
the
point
of
the
death
of
the
insured,
you
have
a
bond,
in
pace
amount
of
the
insurance
policy,
which
is
subject
to
claims
on
creditors.
one
claim
that
of
the
united
states
which
is
good
against
the
part
of
the
fund,
the
insurance
proceeds,
the
other
claim
that
of
a
bank
which
is
good
against
the
whole
of
the
bond,
all
of
the
proceeds.
the
wife
claiming
as
beneficiary,
her
interest
is
junior
to
both,
since
it
was
wholly
contingent
one,
arising
only
after
the
taxpayer's
death
and
on
the
condition
that
she
would
remain
his
beneficiary
at
that
time,
since
he
deserved
during
his
lifetime,
the
full
power
to
change
beneficiary.
her
interest
up
until
the
point
of
his
death
was
a
mere
expectancy,
vesting
only
at
his
death,
but
vesting
subject
to
these
prior
liens.
mr.
joseph
kovner
well,
one
was
clearly
on
part
of
the
proceeds
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
cash
value,
the
other,
subject
to
a
single
lien.
but
that
i
think,
did
not
wipeout
the
government's
lien,
it
merely
made
it
a
junior
here.
mr.
joseph
kovner
but
if
the
court
please,
i
would
say,
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
kovner
no.
mr.
joseph
kovner
yes.
mr.
joseph
kovner
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
kovner
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
kovner
if
--
if
she
remained
a
beneficiary
at
the
time
of
death,
but
may
i
--
may
i
take
a
point
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
she
did
but
may
i
take
a
point
as
to
one
statement
your
honor
made,
justice
black.
that
it
was
getting
something
out
of
something
that
wasn't
if
i
understood
you,
the
insurance
property.
and
i
suggest
that
the
insurance
proceeds
were
property
of
the
insured
to
a
very
substantial
extent,
as
this
court
said
in
chase
national
bank.
he
could
control
its
disposition.
he
bought
it,
he
created
--
he
created
it.
he
paid
for
it.
he
could
dispose
of
it,
the
facts
of
this
case
show
that
he
did
in
a
very
important
way.
he
assigned
it
to
a
bank
as
security
for
loan
to
him.
now,
he
could
assign
somebody
else's
as
property
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
joseph
kovner
i
understand
that.
mr.
joseph
kovner
that's
right.
but
in
the
doctrine
of
marshaling,
the
unsecured,
the
creditor,
the
one
bond
creditor
always
gets
the
benefit
of
a
fund
that
he
couldn't
get
directly.
may
i
put
it
this
way?
to
our
mind,
the
case
comes
to
this.
the
taxpayer
during
his
lifetime
owns
one
asset.
the
cash
surrender
value
of
a
certain
insurance
policies.
there
are
two
liens
on
that,
one
of
the
bank
junior
--
senior
and
the
other,
the
federal
tax
lien.
he
also
--
he
also
has
made
a
contract
with
the
third
party,
the
insured,
which
when
taken
together
with
the
assignment
of
that
contract
to
the
bank,
putting
it
altogether
has
said
to
the
insurer
and
to
the
bank,
"if
i
die,
it
might
get
to
the
bank
as
unpaid,
you
pay
the
bank."
out
of
this
other
plan,
this
other
plan,
you
pay
the
bank.
and
the
government's
position
in
(inaudible)
therefore
is
that
leads
the
other
--
the
first
step,
the
cash
surrender
value
available
to
pay
the
bank
--
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
oh,
i
can
get
from
new
york
law
and
--
in
two
respects.
first,
that
new
york
law
--
new
york
law
recognizes
the
cash
surrender
value
as
an
asset
of
the
insured
during
his
lifetime.
new
york
law
recognizes
that
the
insured
taxpayer
may
make
this
kind
of
a
contract
with
an
insurer
to
pay
his
debts
out
of
a
certain
sum
of
money
that
will
become
available
upon
his
debt.
new
york
law
gives
him
the
full
power
and
control
with
that
sum
of
money
could
come
into
existence
upon
his
death,
and
new
york
law
says
that
he
can
assign
that
to
a
bank
to
get
a
loan.
mr.
joseph
kovner
that's
right.
of
course
sir.
mr.
joseph
kovner
or
if
i
may
put
it
in
my
way,
the
contract
he
made
with
the
bank
provided
another
fund
to
pay
the
banks.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
kovner
well,
but
that's
the
very
glide
effect
the
creditor
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
yes.
mr.
joseph
kovner
yes.
mr.
joseph
kovner
yes.
but
our
point
is
that
that
new
york
provision
is
subject
to
the
control
of
the
taxpayer.
mr.
joseph
kovner
well,
i
--
i
think,
yes
he
does.
it
seems
to
me
the
--
my
--
my
adversary's
effort
to
please
the
situation
as
of
the
date
of
the
taxpayer's
debt
simply
ignores
this
other
very
substantial
fund
which
was
created
by
the
taxpayer,
which
he
paid
for,
which
he
controlled,
which
was
available
to
pay
any
of
his
debts
that
weren't
paid
at
the
time
of
his
debts.
mr.
joseph
kovner
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
joseph
kovner
no.
new
york
law
applies
it
to
a
considerable
extent.
there
is
one
point
new
york
law
that
doesn't
apply
and
that
is
the
part
of
new
york
law
which
exempts
insurance
proceeds
complains
of
creditors.
that
statute
as
such
does
not
apply
to
united
states
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
yes,
as
such,
it
doesn't
apply
to
that
thing.
mr.
joseph
kovner
no,
even
disregards
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
no,
it
doesn't
apply
here.
mr.
joseph
kovner
on
these
facts,
it's
not
applicable
at
all.
mr.
joseph
kovner
not
in
this
case.
because
the
exemption
statute
assumes
that
there
is
property
of
a
debtor
which
but-for
the
exemption
statute
would
be
applicable
to
his
debts.
that's
not
applicable
--
that
exemption
statute
is
not
applicable
for
a
debt
due
united
states,
the
tax
debt
due
the
united
states
because
the
tax
debt
due
united
states
has
its
own
very
limited
exemptions
and
it
does
not
include
insurance
proceeds.
it
didn't
applicable
to
the
insurer
because
under
the
new
york
law,
the
insurer
could
waive
that
exemption
and
submit
his
property
to
with
the
insurance
proceeds
to
the
payment
of
the
debt.
mr.
joseph
kovner
to
a
payment
of
his
debt.
so
it's
not
in
the
picture.
the
question
really
as
--
and
i
think,
i
can
conclude
on
judge
hand's
reasons.
the
question
is
at
the
time
that
the
taxpayer's
debt,
there
were
two
volunteer
available
to
pay
the
taxpayer's
debt
and
the
--
what
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
doctrine
of
marshaling
to
say,
what
its
rationale
is,
it's
an
old
doctrine.
it
goes
way
back.
it's
been
involved
in
any
number
of
situations.
it
is
--
it's
invoked
in
new
york.
it's
been
invoked
by
this
court,
is
that
the
creditors
--
secured
creditors
will
be
paid
before
there
will
be
anything
left
for
general
claims
or
--
or
subsequent
claims
and
the
knob
of
this
case
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
it
could
--
yes.
we
don't
know.
we
don't
know
in
this
record.
mr.
joseph
kovner
well,
justice
goldberg,
the
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
we
don't
know.
we
don't
know
what
the
cash
surrender
value
of
the
policies
was,
at
the
time,
the
loans
to
the
bank
--
were
made
by
the
bank.
we
don't
know
whether
the
bank
loans
were
in
excess
of
the
cash
surrender
value
or
not.
it
could
have
been.
mr.
joseph
kovner
well,
that's
a
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
because
the
creditors
would
be
bound.
creditors
who
writes,
it
depends
only
upon
state
law
and
having
no
consensual
claim
upon
the
proceeds
would
be
barred
by
the
states.
mr.
joseph
kovner
look
quite,
sir.
i
don't
think
that
puts
it
if
i
myself
--
that
states
will
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
no.
mr.
joseph
kovner
oh,
i
--
if
--
if
the
court
please,
i
don't
know
whether
he
had
that
in
mind
because
i
don't
know
those
facts
but
i
do
say
that
when
he
said
to
the
bank,
"i'll
see
--
i
am
willing
to
see
toward
it.
that
you
can
be
paid
out
of
money
that
would
otherwise
have
gone
to
my
widow."
he
released
other
moneys
for
the
payment
of
the
federal
tax
lien.
mr.
joseph
kovner
well,
that
may
be
because
the
government's
tax
debt
has
special
rights
that
a
lot
--
are
barred
by
state
exemption
statutes.
i
don't
think
that's
so
difficult
being
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
well,
i
recognize
that
fee.
mr.
joseph
kovner
i'm
not
saying
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
i'm
not
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
joseph
kovner
oh,
i
--
i
submit
sir,
the
federal
statute
governs
the
exemption
state,
that
will
tax.
i
mean
it
does
not
provide
them
any
exemption
for
--
for
insurance.
the
congress
thought
that
point
that
your
honor
is
making
was
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
--
what
he
ought
to
be
recognizing
could
provide.
mr.
joseph
kovner
yes,
but
it
is
--
but
this
court
has
said
that
new
york
exemption
laws
in
favor
of
the
widow
do
not
bar
the
federal
tax
debt.
mr.
joseph
kovner
well,
but
our
point
goes
back
to
the
fact
that
this
is
money
in
the
essence
which
the
taxpayer
created
a
fund,
he
created
it
that
she
could
control
them
and
she
could
apply
to
the
payment
of
his
debts.
it
isn't
money
that
just
--
had
no
connection
with
the
taxpayer
and
that
--
on
that
ground.
mr.
joseph
kovner
another
creditor?
mr.
joseph
kovner
no,
the
government
does
enjoy
a
unique
position
in
this
respect
because
another
creditor
who
had
no
claim
against
the
proceeds
would
be
barred
by
the
state
exemption
statutes.
mr.
joseph
kovner
oh,
yes.
mr.
joseph
kovner
here?
mr.
joseph
kovner
well,
if
the
--
if
the
creditor
--
if
a
--
a
private
creditor
who
has
a
lien
on
the
cash
surrender
that,
during
the
cash
surrender
value
was
the
law,
can
only
get
the
cash
that
(inaudible)
mr.
joseph
kovner
and
he
can't
get
no
more.
mr.
joseph
kovner
he
can't
get
to
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
yes.
mr.
joseph
kovner
yes.
mr.
joseph
kovner
yes,
yes.
mr.
joseph
kovner
yes.
mr.
joseph
kovner
the
value
only.
mr.
joseph
kovner
only.
mr.
joseph
kovner
only,
yes.
mr.
joseph
kovner
no.
mr.
joseph
kovner
no.
mr.
joseph
kovner
well,
because
the
private
credit
--
because
the
--
the
government
recognized
this
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
well,
if
the
court
please,
if
i
lose
my
case
by
stating
to
you
what
the
law
is,
i've
lost
my
case
because
of
the
law
not
because
of
my
answer.
but
if
i
understand
it,
a
private
creditor
--
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
joseph
kovner
no.
my
understanding
that
one
man
extended
to
the
total
proceed.
mr.
joseph
kovner
that's
right.
that's
right
mr.
joseph
kovner
yes.
mr.
joseph
kovner
the
precise
difference
is
that
the
private
creditor
is
barred
by
the
state
exemption
statute
as
to
the
proceeds
and
that
policy
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
--
but
the
government
is
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
well,
my
understanding
of
the
case
is
if
the
court
would
say
that
in
such
a
case,
the
private
creditor
who
had
a
lien
only
on
the
cash
surrender
value
would
be
getting
the
benefit
of
the
debt
proceeds
which
were
by
statute
exempt
from
his
claim
and
it
would
not
extend
the
marshaling
doctrine
on
that
account.
mr.
joseph
kovner
yes.
well,
i
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
no.
i
think
that
marshaling
--
the
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
private
creditor
in
the
case
given
would
have
had
the
benefit
of
the
marshaling
doctrine
but-for
a
state
exemption
statute.
that
state
exemption
statute
does
not
apply
to
the
united
states
and
therefore,
the
marshaling
doctrine
can
be
ignored.
mr.
joseph
kovner
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
kovner
as
to
the
first
creditor.
mr.
joseph
kovner
yes.
mr.
joseph
kovner
well,
i'm
--
i'm
ground
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
i
--
my
only
point
is
that
i'm
bound
to
advice
the
court
of
the
law.
mr.
joseph
kovner
i
think
your
honor.
there
are
cases
which
are
so-called
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
well,
those
cases,
if
the
court
please,
were
relied
upon
rather
heavily
by
the
petitioner
in
wintner
and
where
--
in
the
wintner
case,
that's
the
case
this
--
that
it's
a
companion
to
this
case
arising
out
of
the
sixth
circuit.
you
held
it
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
and
that
argument
was
addressed
to
the
court
in
wintner
both
to
the
district
court
and
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
that
it
had
been
two
private
creditors.
the
doctrine
of
marshaling
would
have
not
been
invoked
because
the
effect
would
have
been
to
defeat
the
exemption
statute
for
the
benefit
of
the
widow.
but
the
sixth
circuit
accepted
the
government's
argument
that
since
the
exemption
statute
did
not
bar
the
government,
the
government
retained
the
benefit
of
the
marshaling
of
asset
stocks.
now,
it
is
now
--
it
was
there.
it
is.
and
it's
just
not
feeling
that
the
tax
debt
does
have
a
special
priority
which
private
debts
don't
have.
that's
been
illustrated
by
more
than
one
case
and
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
it's
true.
mr.
joseph
kovner
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
kovner
that's
right.
but
--
but
the
--
but
the
reason
why
this
court
limited
the
federal
tax
lien,
which
is
otherwise
all
embracing
through
the
cash
value
was
because
it
interpose
to
invest
a
limitation
upon
the
reach
of
the
federal
taxing
and
that
it
had
to
be
property
which
the
taxpayer
could
enjoy
during
his
lifetime.
that
didn't
mean
that
the
proceeds
weren't
the
taxpayer's
property.
it's
our
point
here
which
somewhat
counts
us
the
equity
which
the
court
is
speaking
of
which
lies
behind
the
exemption
statutes
that
this
is
not
property
of
the
wives
that's
being
ceased
by
the
government
to
pay
the
husband's
tax
debt.
this
is
property
that
the
husband
created
that
in
a
number
of
very
important
respects
is
his
property
that
escaped
the
reach
of
the
federal
tax
lien
by
his
brother.
mr.
joseph
kovner
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
joseph
kovner
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
kovner
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
kovner
no.
mr.
joseph
kovner
well,
he
also
has
during
his
lifetime
a
disposition
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
that's
right.
the
property
is
--
we
use
the
old
phrase
abundant
there
a
lot
of
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
--
banks.
he
has
made
a
contract
with
the
insurance
company
for
which
he
pays
to
pay
certain
--
to
pay
a
sum
of
money
to
people
whom
(inaudible)
mr.
joseph
kovner
that's
a
pretty
important
right.
this
court
had
in
chase
national
bank
that
that
was
enough
to
include
the
property
and
this
is
a
fair
state
tax.
if
it
had
not
been
his
property
at
all,
it
could
have
been
--
been
included
in
his
estate
--
the
state
--
state
tax
purposes,
i
think
this
case
really
lies
squarely
between
the
rule
to
invest,
that
the
reach
of
the
federal
tax
lien
is
only
to
property
which
the
taxpayer
can
possess
during
his
lifetime
and
chase
which
holds
that
as
to
insurance,
the
taxpayer
has
a
very
important
property
interest
to
whip
the
control
and
disposition
of
a
sum
upon
his
debt.
and
the
government's
assertion
is
that
those
interest
is
so
close
that
where
the
taxpayer
has
provided
that
a
credit,
another
lien
creditor
will
be
paid
out
of
that
sum
but
that
creditor
ought
to
be
satisfied
out
of
that
sum
leaving
the
government
to
collect
assets
otherwise,
it
would
--
otherwise,
it's
been
taken
by
that
creditor
now
become
available
too.
i
think
if
you
read
chase
(inaudible)
the
case
is
not
quite
so
simple
in
equity
of
the
widow
because
to
suggest
that
it's
the
equity
of
the
widow
is
only
to
suggest
somehow
or
the
other
that
the
government
is
taking
property
belonging
to
the
widow.
mr.
joseph
kovner
yes.
mr.
joseph
kovner
yes,
but
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
yes.
mr.
joseph
kovner
yes.
mr.
joseph
kovner
but
--
but
justice
brennan,
what
i
have
quite
take
as
the
next
step
in
that
is
the
fact
that
these
state
exemption
statutes
do
not
directly
by
the
federal
collection
of
revenue.
so
that
if
you're
saying
--
you
are
saying
the
federal
government
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
joseph
kovner
i
don't
know.
the
state
exemption
statutes
indicate
an
equity
here.
the
question
is
whether
that
equity
goes
so
fast
to
defeat
the
federal
tax
lien
these
days.
mr.
joseph
kovner
well,
i'm
saying
if
you
put
a
private
creditor
in
place
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
--
he
could
not
involve
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
--
the
marshaling
doctrine.
mr.
joseph
kovner
yes,
justice
white.
if
you
put
a
private
creditor
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
kovner
that's
right
because
the
big
difference
between
the
two
cases
is
that
the
private
creditor
is
directly
barred
by
the
state
exemption
statute
and
the
united
states
is
not.
mr.
joseph
kovner
well,
but
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
--
but
may
--
may
i
suggest,
justice
goldberg,
that
the
rule
--
this
court
has
laid
down
in
all
the
rule
that
the
federal
tax
lien
was
not
subject
to
state
exemptions.
it's
a
very
basic
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
yes,
sir,
that
got
to
start
with
that,
didn't
try
directly
or
indirectly.
mr.
joseph
kovner
that's
the
fact.
mr.
joseph
kovner
oh,
yes.
mr.
joseph
kovner
but
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
oh,
yes,
but
i'm
--
mr.
joseph
kovner
--
but
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
state
law
indicates
that
the
insurance
proceeds
are
property
of
the
taxpayer
but
for
the
exception.
mr.
joseph
kovner
what?
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
joseph
kovner
well
--
no,
because
merely
all
of
the
states
have
the
exemption
statutes
and
i
--
there
are
some
cases,
i
think
almost
every
state
in
fact
we
cited
textbook,
the
court
can
find
in
the
textbook,
we
cited
it
in
very
recent
textbook
a
collection
of
those
state
statutes.
as
far
as
i
know,
the
state
statutes
are
--
are
in
almost
every
state,
they
vary.
some
confine
the
exemption
through
immediate
beneficiaries.
the
new
york
statute
does
not.
some
confine
the
exemption
proceeds
to
a
fixed
amount
not
more
than
$15,000
or
$20,000
but
i
don't
regard
those
exemption
statutes
as
any
different
from
the
several
kinds
of
state
exemption
statutes
of
many
--
of
additional
exemption
statutes.
mr.
joseph
kovner
this
is
not
the
only
state
exemption
as
that.
mr.
joseph
kovner
yes.
mr.
joseph
kovner
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
kovner
yes.
mr.
joseph
kovner
this
case
involves
--
just
indeed,
if
the
court
please,
i
would
submit
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
a
federal
law,
two
points
in
federal
law.
one
is
the
federal
lien
law,
the
exclusive
priority
and
--
of
the
federal
statute
that
it
is
subject
only
to
exemptions
expressly
provided
for
by
congress
and
third,
that
the
federal
government
in
the
collection
of
its
federal
lien
is
entitled
to
invoke
the
marshaling
doctrine.
