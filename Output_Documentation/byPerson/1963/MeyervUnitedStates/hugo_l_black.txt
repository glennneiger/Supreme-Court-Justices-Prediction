he
had
no
collectible
interest
at
all,
in
this
policy
as
i
understand
it
except
the
cash
surrender
value
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.

so
he
had
nothing
on
which
the
lien
could
attach?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
select
its
death
out
of
money
that
the
husband
never
owned
and
never
could
have
collected
but
which
was
that
as
a
wife
upon
his
death.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
were
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
--
on
just
cash,
they're
in
the
value.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
government
get
a
lien
on
something
she
--
she
didn't
own
--
he
didn't
own
and
never
did
own?
justice
hugo
l.
black
except
by
a
formulation
which
occurs
in
that
behrens
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
which
have
ignores
the
fact
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
the
contract
was
made
in
new
york,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
governed
by
new
york
laws
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
part
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
very
time
the
contract
was
made,
it
meant
that
she
would
get
that
part
that
exempt
to
her
under
new
york
laws.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
she
did,

he
didn't
assign
it
to
the
bank
security
for
his
tax.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
didn't
assign
it
to
the
bank
as
security
for
his
tax.
the
government
might
have
his
taxed
on
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
his
--
his
right
to
have
done
so
if
he
had
done
it,
he
wouldn't
have
done
much
that
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
however,
you
get
it.
you
don't
get
it
from
anything
he
wanted
to
do
and
you
don't
get
it
from
new
york
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
the
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
this
giving
us
security
for
the
bank
and
made
it
liable
for
the
debt,
why
are
limited
to
the
bank?
i
could
do
whether
i
will
get
anything.
why
wouldn't
the
other
creditors
have
a
right
to
come
in
and
get,
you
can
pay
the
new
funds
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
subject
to
creditors?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words
that
--
having
no
agreement
from
him
to
pay
them,
they
couldn't
recover
but
the
government
having
no
agreement
from
him
can
recover.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
--
why
--
did
the
government
have
an
agreement
with
him?
can
you
imagine
any?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
its
find
any
implication
that
he
wanted
this
by
agreeing
to
make
your
security
to
the
bank
for
the
debt
that
he
wanted
debt
to
provide
for
payment
of
his
taxes
and
take
his
insurance
to
witness
with
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
the
government
and
nobody
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
a
little
difficult
without
the
committee's
exemption,
didn't
he?
you
don't
find
anymore
difficulty
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
those
loans
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
they've
been
given
all
over
the
country.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where's
those
exemption
laws,
the
effect
that
they've
been
given
all
over
the
country?
you
would
come
in
and
take
this,
the
government
would,
on
the
fear
that
him
alone,
of
all
the
creditors,
come
in
and
place
the
taxes
and
get
the
widow's
exemption
away
from
her
that
her
husband
had
bought
for
her
in
the
insurance
policy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
federal
--
federal
statutes
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
federal
statute
hasn't
said
that
that
new
york
exemption
law
cannot
be
advised
in
favor
of
a
widow,
has
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
if
--
not
if
the
--
not
if
the
taxpayer
has
the
money.
