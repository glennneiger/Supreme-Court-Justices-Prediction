i'm
talking
about
the
cash
surrender
value
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
which
persist
property
during
his
lifetime?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
event
--
in
which
event
both
the
bank,
i'm
suggesting
both
the
bank
and
the
government
had
a
lien
on
the
cash
surrender
value.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
loan
has
been
paid,
certainly
the
--
you
wouldn't
suggest
for
a
minute
that
the
government
did
not
have
a
lien.
what
if
the
loan
with
the
bank
had
been
paid
before
the
insured
died,
would
you
suggest
the
government
didn't
have
a
lien
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
you
--
you
just
suggest
those,
there
cannot
be
a
second
lien
of
the
--
on
the
same
cash
surrender
value.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
would
certainly
not
have
been
exempt
from
the
lien
of
this
bank
loan.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
said
--
is
it
your
position
that
the
new
york
law
does
govern
this
all
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
your
position
that
the
new
york
law
does
govern
this
matter
on
whether
marshaling
applies
or
whether
it
doesn't
or
what
assets
would
be
exempt?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
--
you
say
that
normally,
the
marshaling
rule
applies
in
new
york
but
it
doesn't
apply
where
insurance
policies
are
--
are
involved
on
the
--
and
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
extend
the
benefit
of
the
private
creditor.
justice
byron
r.
white
either
a
consensual
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
either
a
consensual
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
or
lien
creditor,
he
cannot
invoke
the
marshaling
doctrine.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
must
say
then
that
the
state
exemption
statute
does
not
control
but
its
federal
law
that
controls
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
on
its
priority.
