justice
potter
stewart
why
not,
why
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
i'm
concern,
if
your
answer
is
no
but
if
you
can
convince
me
that
your
answer
is
no
then
you
lost
your
case.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know,
but
except
in
mr.
justice
goldberg's
hypothetically
case,
the
--
the
debtor
had
voluntarily
agreed
by
contract
that
the
proceeds,
the
entire
proceeds
to
the
life
insurance
policy
would
be
available
to
the
first
creditor.
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore,
the
statute
has
been
waived,
has
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
and
therefore
the
--
and
the
second
creditor
has
a
lien
on
the
on
the
cash
surrender
value
which
is
property
of
the
insured
during
his
lifetime
and
the
extent
of
his
property
during
his
lifetime.
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore,
wouldn't
--
i
don't
see
how
the
--
how
the
state
statute
would
come
into
effect
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
it
does,
again
as
i
say,
you
convince
me
that
you're
wrong
on
behalf
of
the
government.
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
court
taking
the
law
as
i
stated
finds
that
partakes
the
government
case,
i
will
have
to
accept
it.
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
term
to
the
statue
itself
that
it
--
the
lien
attaches
only
to
a
property
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
belonging
to
the
taxpayer.
justice
potter
stewart
and
all
that
belonged
to
the
taxpayer
was
the
cash
surrender
value.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
life
insurance
policy
is
a
contract.
i
mean
that's
basically
what
it
is.
justice
potter
stewart
a
life
insurance
is
a
contract
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
between
a
person
and
an
insurance
company.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
the
only
property
that
was
--
that
belonged
to
the
--
to
the
insurer
during
his
lifetime,
he
extended
the
property,
was
the
cash
surrender
value
of
the
policy.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
certainly
--
certain
contractual
rights
but
the
only
property
and
money.
the
only
--
the
only
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
but
state
law
applies
in
the
--
in
--
in
telling
us
what
is
property
of
the
taxpayer,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
aquilino
and
durham
cases
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
bess
and
stern.
justice
potter
stewart
where
did
you
get
that?
justice
potter
stewart
where
did
you
get
that
law
(inaudible)
