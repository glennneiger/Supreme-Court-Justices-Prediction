mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
yes,
your
honor,
if
the
court
pleases.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
ethel
meyer,
the
petitioner,
is
the
wife
of
peter
meyer,
deceased.
peter
meyer,
in
1943,
had
life
insurance
policies
totaling
some
$50,000.
under
1943,
he
borrowed
from
the
huntington
national
bank
of
ohio
the
sum
of
about
$26,000
and
made
assignments
and
pledged
these
life
insurance
policies
upon
which
his
wife
was
the
beneficiary
to
the
bank
for
these
loans
which
were
made
to
him.
now,
in
1943,
peter
meyer
did
not
owe
the
united
states
government
any
moneys,
any
tax
moneys
at
all.
in
1945
and
1946
--
1946,
the
tax
liabilities
for
those
years
arose
which
were
due
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
from
peter
meyer.
now,
the
government
in
1946
and
in
1947
made
assessments
on
those
tax
moneys
some
$6100.
and
as
soon
as
they
made
those
tax
assessments
under
the
code,
united
states
code,
the
tax
liens
arose.
now,
they
were
unpaid.
these
taxes
were
unpaid.
in
1955,
peter
meyer
died,
so
that
there
was
due
to
the
government
from
his
estate
some
$6100.
the
bank
having
received
assignments
and
pledge
of
these
policies
upon
his
death,
the
bank
received
the
sum
of
$26,800
or
thereabouts,
$26,000,
i
should
say,
$26,800,
which
was
due
the
bank
for
the
loans
and
that
exhausted
practically
with
the
exception
of
some
$400,
the
entire
shares
surrender
value
of
the
policies.
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
yes,
your
honor.
under
the
agreement,
the
bank
had
the
right
to
collect
the
money
that
was
due
it
from
all
--
from
the
entire
proceeds
of
the
policies.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
net
proceeds.
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
yes.
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
from
the
entire
amounts.
now,
the
widow
received
her
moneys,
the
balance
of
the
proceeds
which
would
be
some
$24,000
or
$23,000
from
the
insurance
companies.
and
the
united
states
government
then
brought
an
action
against
ethel
meyer,
individually
and
as
executrix
of
the
estate,
of
peter
meyer's
estate,
to
collect
this
$6100.
and
the
--
the
position
that
counsel
for
mrs.
meyer
took
was
that
this
money
is
justly
due
to
--
from
her
estates
because
it
was
due
from
the
estate,
the
husband
and
the
estate
owed
the
money.
however,
the
courts
granted
summary
judgment
against
her
personally
upon
the
basis
that
the
proceeds
that
she
received
were
subject
to
those
tax
claims.
now,
because
there
are
decisions
rendered
by
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
the
case
of
--
which
were
handed
down
in
1958,
in
the
case
of
commissioner
against
stern
and
united
states
against
bess,
where
this
court
has
held,
and
i've
omitted
an
important
trace
of
this
case,
new
york
state
section
166
has
an
insurance
law
which
states
that
the
proceeds
of
life
insurance
are
entirely
exempt
from
creditors
of
the
insured.
various
other
states
throughout
the
united
states
have
similar
laws.
this
court
has
interpreted
laws
of
various
states
and
as
i
recall,
the
commissioner
against
stern
case
and
united
states
against
bess,
involved
kentucky
statutes
as
well
as
new
jersey
statutes
which
contained
similar
provisions
of
exemption.
now,
in
the
case
of
commissioner
--
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
unless
of
course,
the
--
the
--
yes,
pledges
the
proceeds,
yes,
your
honor.
now,
the
cases
have
held
that
--
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
no,
your
honor.
this
is
--
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
the
bank
loans
were
but
we
maintained
that
the
tax
lien
which
the
government
had
never
attached
to
the
proceeds
because
this
is
the
crux
of
the
case.
this
is
the
distinguishing
feature
of
our
case
from
any
other
case.
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
i
can't
claim
anymore
than
that
your
honor.
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
your
honor
--
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
yes.
this
is
the
crux
of
the
case
and
i'm
going
to
come
to
it
right
this
minute.
the
government
is
relying
upon
a
decision
which
was
handed
down
in
the
united
states
against
behrens
in
1956
or
some
two
years
before
this
court
handed
down
decisions
in
united
states
against
bess,
in
which
judge
learned
hand
had
before
him
a
situation
not
similar
to
ours
and
briefly,
the
facts
in
the
behrens
case
were
as
follows,
in
which
the
equitable
doctrine
of
marshaling
was
--
was
applied.
in
the
behrens
case,
we
had
the
tax
liens
arising
and
attaching
immediately
to
the
cash
surrender
value,
immediately,
which
is
done
(inaudible)
as
i'll
come
to
in
a
moment.
thereafter,
because
the
tax
liens
in
the
behrens
case
weren't
filed,
they
had
to
be
recorded
and
the
bank
in
that
case
being
an
innocent
holder,
having
--
not
had
an
opportunity
to
check
against
the
recording
acts,
to
see
whether
there
were
any
tax
liens
on
fire.
the
bank
subsequently,
in
the
behrens
case,
lent
money
to
the
insured
and
--
and
up
to
the
full
amount
of
the
cash
surrender
value.
now,
what
happened
there
was
this.
in
as
much
as
the
tax
lien
was
not
filed
in
the
proper
office,
the
court
in
the
behrens
case
held
that
the
government
did
not
have
a
first
lien
but
it
had
a
second
lien
subject
to
the
bank,
but
it
still
had
a
lien.
and
judge
learned
hand
said
in
applying
the
marshaling
doctrine,
he
says,
in
as
much
as
the
bank
can
collect
the
proceeds
of
the
policy
and
also
the
entire
proceeds
of
the
policy,
which
would
include
the
cash
surrender
value,
"we
will
allow
the
bank
to
attach
its
lien
to
the
widow's
share
so
that
the
government
which
had
the
tax
lien
on
the
cash
surrender
value
can
be
paid."
we
don't
dispute
that,
but
we
say
that
our
case
is
a
material
difference,
is
our
case.
in
1943,
there
was
no
tax
lien.
there
was
not
even
a
tax
due.
in
1943,
mr.
meyer
borrowed
from
the
ohio
bank
the
full
cash
surrender
value
of
the
policy,
so
we
start
with
the
face
there
is
no
more
cash
surrender
value
left,
whatever.
the
government
didn't
have
a
secondary
lien,
it
didn't
attach.
there
was
nothing
due
the
government
at
that
time.
now,
some
three
years
later,
the
government
comes
along
and
makes
an
assessment.
as
soon
as
that
assessment
is
made,
if
there
is
any
property
or
property
rights
that
the
insured
has
in
1946
and
1947,
it
will
attach,
but
there's
nothing
left
because
the
cash
surrender
value
was
disposed
off,
so
that
the
marshaling
doctrine
can't
apply.
the
cash
surrender
value
was
disposed
off
in
1943.
now,
the
government's
lien
attaches
to
what?
to
any
other
property
or
property
rights
that
the
insured
had.
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
true,
your
honor.
that
is
the
agreement
between
the
bank
and
the
insurers,
but
the
government
isn't
--
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
yes.
your
honor,
under
the
cases,
the
cases
hold
and
i
will
read
this
court's
decision
that
the
tax
lien
can
only
attach
to
cash
surrender
value
during
the
lifetime
of
the
insured
and
the
trouble
with
this
--
with
the
government's
--
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
there
can't
be
second
lien
your
honor,
but
the
--
it
must
attach
during
his
lifetime.
now
in
this
case,
it
could
only
--
your
honor
--
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
no,
it
didn't
because
--
because
it's
only
payable
after
his
death.
the
insured
can't
do
anything
with
the
cash
surrender
value.
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
it
is.
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
well,
the
only
difference
is
this,
--
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
yes,
it
would.
if
that
were
the
situation,
it
would
because
then
the
government's
lien
would
attach
during
the
lifetime
of
the
insured.
that's
the
distinction,
i
read
it
right
from
the
--
from
the
--
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
there
can
be
a
second
lien,
your
honor,
but
the
--
an
existence
of
a
lien
is
not
enough.
it's
got
to
attach
during
the
lifetime
of
the
insured.
and
in
this
case,
it
didn't
attach
during
the
lifetime
of
the
insured.
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
no,
your
honor,
it
could
collect
to
that
--
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
i
misunderstood.
it's
perfectly
right.
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
that's
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court
in
the
--
this
court
in
the
bess
case
made
the
same
statements
at
page
57,
which
is
quoted
from
on
page
14
of
my
brief.
it
says,
"the
question,
therefore,
is
whether
the
cash
surrender
values
with
the
liens
attached
were
transferred
to
mrs.
bess
as
beneficiary
when
mr.
bess
died."
now,
she
--
she
received
no
transfer
of
any
cash
surrender
value.
she
only
collected
her
own
proceeds.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
behrens
case
where
the
equitable
doctrine
was
applied,
judge
learned
hand
and
i
quote
his
language
on
page
10
of
my
brief.
it
says
this,
"the
tax
lien
not
being
filed
did
not
indeed
have
priority
over
the
pledge,
but
it's
attached
because
there
was
a
tax
lien
in
the
beginning."
then
judge
hand
goes
on
and
says,
"the
united
states
does
not
assert
that
it
could
recover
if
no
lien
had
attached
to
this
surrender
values
during
behrens'
life."
that
significant
language
and
then
--
and
then
the
other
cases
decided
by
this
court,
there
were
holdings
that
the
tax
lien
must
attach
during
the
lifetime
of
the
insured
because
--
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
well,
your
honor,
the
--
the
difficulty
there
is
this,
if
the
bank
--
if
the
bank
had
been
paid,
undoubtedly
there
would've
been
a
new
cash
surrender
value
sprung
up
sometime
and
if
he
had
gotten
that
money,
the
government's
lien
of
course,
would
attach.
well,
the
government's
lien
would
attach
but
in
this
situation,
all
she
collected
were
proceeds
which
were
exempt
under
state
law
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
holds
that
where
creditors
have
an
exempt
--
where
credit
--
where
the
proceeds
of
a
policy
are
exempt
from
creditors,
then
the
--
as
far
as
tax
liens
are
concerned,
we
follow
state
law.
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
as
far
as
the
--
yes,
it
would.
yes,
your
honor,
it
would.
the
bank
could
collect
it.
but
we're
dealing
now
with
the
tax
lien
which
is
not
--
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
well
--
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
no,
they
--
it's
never
exempt
from
bank
liens.
in
other
words,
whatever
the
--
the
insured
creates,
the
statute
has
no
--
it
does
not
concern
itself.
if
the
insured
agreed
to
pay
the
bank
and
he
pledged
the
policies,
naturally,
the
bank
is
entitled
to
be
paid.
we're
talking
about
other
creditors.
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
well,
in
the
bess
case,
your
honor,
the
widow
received
the
entire
proceeds
of
the
policy.
there
were
no
bank
loans,
whatever.
it
was
held
in
that
case
that
by
reason
of
the
tax
lien
which
the
government
acquired,
that
whatever
she
received,
she
must
pay
to
the
extent
of
the
cash
surrender
value
to
the
government
for
tax
liens.
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
in
our
case,
--
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
your
honor,
i
think
--
yes.
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
that's
part
--
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
no,
in
the
bess
case,
we
had
no
loans,
whatever.
your
honor
in
the
bess
case
simply
held
this.
that
--
that
a
tax
--
that
a
tax
lien
that
the
government
has
will
attach
to
the
cash
surrender
value
and
when
the
insured
dies
with
his
property,
the
government
then
is
entitled
to
collect
from
the
widow
the
equivalent
of
the
cash
surrender
value
because
that's
property
and
property
rights
to
which
the
tax
lien
applies.
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
yes,
your
honor,
judge
learned
hand
--
this
was
a
decision
in
--
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
that
i
don't
know
your
honor.
as
far
as
taxes
are
concerned,
--
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
generally,
i
think
it
is
followed
now.
the
equitable
doctrine
is
followed
and
we
have
no
dispute
with
that.
but
we
say
that
in
the
application
of
the
equitable
doctrine,
the
facts
are
entirely
different.
the
government
gets
a
lien
immediately
during
the
lifetime
of
the
insured.
that
lien
attaches.
but
it
doesn't
file
it
and
because
it
doesn't
file
it,
a
subsequent
bank
loan
which
is
made,
comes
first
as
a
creditor
and
head
of
the
government
by
reason
of
the
statute
requiring
filing,
but
the
government's
lien
is
dead,
becomes
a
secondary
lien,
then
when
the
insured
died.
the
theory
is
that
even
though
the
widow
only
receives
the
proceeds
less
the
cash
surrender
value,
she's
still
liable
because
of
--
under
the
equitable
doctrine
that's
applied,
the
court
says,
in
as
much
as
the
bank
has
a
first
lien
on
the
entire
proceeds
of
the
policy,
we
will
permit
the
bank
to
collect
that
portion
of
the
proceeds
which
doesn't
represent
the
cash
surrender
value.
and
then
the
government's
lien
that
has
a
reason,
secondary
lien
that
has
a
reason,
he
will
permit
the
government
to
collect
it
from
the
cash
surrender
value.
this
is
not
our
case.
this
--
our
case
is
entirely
different.
in
our
case,
the
government
never
had
a
tax
lien
that
could
attach
to
the
cash
surrender
value
because
in
1943,
before
any
taxes
were
due,
the
full
cash
surrender
value
was
--
we'll
say
mortgage,
if
i
may
put
it
so
or
assign
the
--
the
policies
were
assigned
to
the
bank
as
collateral
security.
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
the
second
mortgage?
no,
your
honor,
except
this,
that
on
the
decisions
which
have
been
handed
down
today,
they're
all
in
accord
that
the
government's
tax
lien
was
to
attach
during
the
lifetime
of
the
insured.
then
in
this
case,
it
couldn't
attach
during
the
lifetime.
it
could
only
attach
after
his
death.
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
that's
right,
that's
right.
he
couldn't
even
write
to
them
to
a
second
lien.
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
could
attach
and
having
disposed
of
it
in
1943,
we
cannot
apply
the
equitable
doctrine
either
because
then,
we
would
be
violating
--
when
i
say,
we,
i
mean,
the
theory
would
be
violating
the
new
york
state
statute,
which
says
that
the
proceeds
that
a
widow
or
any
insured
will
receive
is
exempt
from
creditors
of
the
insured.
and
in
this
case,
the
government
would
then
be
coming
along
and
--
and
saying
this
count
that
statute,
we
come
first.
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
since
the
proceeds
under
new
york
state
statute
are
exempt
from
claims
of
creditors,
the
government
must
show
that
it
acquired
a
lien
during
his
lifetime
and
it
couldn't
because
disposition
was
made
on
that
before
any
tax
claim
even
arose,
and
that's
some
substance
of
our
case.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
can
i
just
have
one
minute,
your
honor?
mr.
samuel
w.
sherman
thank
you
sir.
your
honors,
this
is
beyond
dispute,
a
mere
reading
of
commissioner
against
stern
which
was
decided
by
this
court
1958
involving
a
kentucky
statute
similar
to
the
new
york
statute
of
exemption
of
creditors.
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
42
of
the
court's
opinion
just
a
mere
sentence.
"we
hold
that
the
kentucky
statutes
govern
the
question
of
the
beneficiary
liability
and
treat
no
liability
--
and
create
no
liability
of
respondent,"
that's
the
government,
"to
the
--
to
the
government
in
the
circumstances
of
the
case."
in
that
case,
in
commission
against
stern,
the
government
--
the
widow,
upon
the
death
of
the
insured
received
not
only
the
proceeds
but
received
also
the
full
cash
surrender
value
of
the
policy.
and
the
government
came
along
and
said,
"why,
we
want
that
money
to
the
extent
of
the
full
cash
surrender
value."
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
that
case
said,
"the
government
can't
get
it
by
reason
of
this
exemption.
it
can
only
get
it
--"
page
47,
"we
agree
that
the
state
law
may
not
destroy
a
lien
which
has
attached
in
the
insured's
lifetime."
so
that
in
this
case,
in
our
case,
if
the
government's
lien
attached
in
the
lifetime
of
the
insured,
the
government
would
get
it.
but
in
as
much
as
it
didn't,
this
--
the
--
the
government
being
accredited
just
like
any
other
creditor
must
follow
state
law
and
these
proceeds
are
entirely
exempt
on
the
state
law
and
it
hasn't
gotten
any
greater
right.
congress
has
not
yet
enacted
any
lien
granting
to
the
government
any
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
only
law
of
congress
is
laid
down
where
the
government
is
given
a
tax
lien
on
all
property
and
property
rights.
what
are
property
and
property
rights
are
still
defined
by
state
law.
and
in
this
case,
section
166
defines
what
a
property
and
property
rights
and
therefore,
the
government's
lien
never
attached
during
a
lifetime
and
the
widow
isn't
entitled
to
her
own
proceeds.
she
never
got
the
chance
to
run
the
value.
in
the
behrens'
case,
the
widow
got
the
full
cash
surrender
value
and
paid
the
bank
the
money.
in
our
case,
she
only
got
her
proceeds.
that's
entirely
exempted.
thank
you.
