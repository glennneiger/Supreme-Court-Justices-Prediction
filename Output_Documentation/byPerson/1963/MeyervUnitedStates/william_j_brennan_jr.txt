(inaudible)
justice

well
i
gather
your
point
is
that
as
long
as
the
insured
lives,
if
the
bank
had
to
collect
its
loan,
they
could
collect
it
only
out
of
the
insurance
or
the
cash
surrender
value,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
long
as
the
insured
live,
if
they
had
to
collect
the
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
collectible
only
at
the
cash
surrender
value.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
for
this
reason
you
say
that
at
the
time
that
the
federal
tax
lien
attached,
there
was
no
cash
surrender
value
in
his
lifetime
to
which
it
could've
had?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
would
not
be
new
york
state
law,
would
it?
if
this
bank
loan
they
proceeded
for
example
with
cash
surrender
value
of
the
policy,
this
agreement
that
then
have
known
to
be
payable
out
of
the
proceeds
after
that,
would've
been
a
good
agreement
under
new
york
law,
would
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
understand
what
--
what's
the
significance
of
the
new
york
insurance
provision
that
proceeds
are
exempt
from
the
liens
of
creditors?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
recall
--
as
i
recall
the
bess
case,
there
was
no
commitment
of
the
bank
--
of
the
proceeds
to
any
loans
of
the
receipts
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
because
the
insured
had
not
committed
any
part
of
the
--
of
the
proceeds
of
the
insurance
in
the
payment
of
any
debts,
as
in
this
case.
here
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
certainly
the
insured,
committed
the
whole
proceeds,
not
merely
the
cash
surrender
value
to
the
payment
of
the
bank
loan.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that
was
not
so,
in
the
bess
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
and
is
new
york
follow
this
rule
of
equitable
marshaling?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
i
mean
does
new
york
state
follow
that
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
generally,
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
might
be
a
good
word
--
for
word
but
there's
nothing
new
york
law
which
wouldn't
make
possible
a
second
mortgage,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
couldn't
write
when
you
mean
into
a
first
lien
in
the
lifetime
of
this
insured,
unless
he
paid
the
bank
loan.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
then
if
--
if
this
insurer
had
not
made
the
contract
with
the
bank
--
the
bank,
you
may
collect
out
of
the
proceeds
of
the
policy.
but
had
made
a
contract
with
the
bank,
you
may
collect
only
out
of
the
cash
surrender
value
policy,
you
wouldn't
be
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
only
reason
you
are
here
is
that
the
contract
he
made
with
the
bank
allowed
the
bank
to
collect
out
of
the
proceeds.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
fact
is
though
i
gather
somewhat
--
your
adversary
said
that
under
new
york
law,
the
property
or
the
--
the
proceeds
would
attempt
and
exempt
from
the
final
creditors,
what
more
the
insurer
agreement
with
the
bank
if
the
bank
could
collect
that
at
first?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
--
i
understand
it,
yes.
that
would
be
so.
and
so
--
and
without
such
an
agreement
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
think
if
the
new
york
law
provision
which
accepts
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
proceeds
from
it
there
by
(inaudible)
of
the
states.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
i
understand
that.
and
it
gathered
it
to
your
adversary
too
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
this
fact.
oh.
oh,
i
could
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
that
doesn't
disregard
marshaling.
it's
certainly
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
does
apply
here
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
by
the
facts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
someone
gets
a
judgment
against
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.

(inaudible)

brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
your
real
difficulty
is
that
--
well,
that
maybe
true
but
nevertheless
that
these
states
statutes,
whoever
may
have
created
this
upon
that,
the
state
statutes
gives
us
special
exemptions
to
widows
when
their
beneficiaries
of
life
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
insurance
policy
from
the
claims
of
creditors.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
--
and
the
fact
that
chase
said
it
was
--
the
creation
really
of
the
husband
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
he
built
it
up.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
has
--
has
to
stock
up
against
that
provision
of
the
state
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
to
a
third
factor.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
to
a
third
factor
but
i
don't
see
that
chase
would
necessarily
answer
the
problem.
you
can't
--
you
simply
can't
write-off
the
state
exemption
statutes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
argument
sounds
to
me
now
something
like
that
there's
some
analogy
in
new
britain
in
that
line
of
cases
that
this
is
a
federal
law
question.
and
a
problem
of
the
federal
lien
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
that
it's
not
that
much
influenced
by
state
law,
that
this
is
not
what
his
property,
which
we
said
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
was
a
state
law
in
question.
this
is
really
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
a
nature
priority,
isn't
it?
