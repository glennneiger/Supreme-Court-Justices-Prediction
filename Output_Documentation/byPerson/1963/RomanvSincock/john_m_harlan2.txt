where
will
that
passage
that
you're
reading
(voice
overlap)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
colonel
weiner,
do
you
consider
the
standard
is
against
which
rationality
of
(inaudible)
should
be
tested?
perhaps
you
better
answer
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
course
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
shows
on
its
face
that
it
was
concerned
with
voting
to
some
extent?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
since
equal
protection
was
written
in
section
1
without
any
definition
of
qualification
that
the
mere
fact
that
it
may
have
been
passed
to
the
context
of
the
racial
situation
does
not
provide
it
--
does
not
prevent
it
from
being
expanded
now
to
cover
voting
situation
which
in
that
time
was
not
a
--
a
live
concern
that
he
was
talking
about.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
yet,
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
the
section
2
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
specifically
shows
that
apportionment
in
some
degree
was
within
the
minds
of
the
people
who
wrote
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
goes
a
little
further
that
what
my
brother
goldberg
has
suggested.
i
think
that's
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
it
says
that
anybody
deny
the
vote
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
suit
had
been
started
as
i
understand
it
originally
before
baker
and
carr
came
down.
justice
john
m.
harlan
they're
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
i'm
thinking
of
another
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
thank
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
say
the
same
thing,
i
realize
that
it
isn't
here
but
i'm
just
interested
in
testing
your
argument,
would
you
say
the
same
thing
in
this
field
that
if
this
--
this
present
apportionment
were
put
up
the
people
of
delaware
and
to
take
an
extreme
example,
they
unanimously
voted
to
a
man
to
sustain
the
apportionment
against
the
decision
of
this
court,
does
that
would
make
any
difference?

john
m.
harlan
in
