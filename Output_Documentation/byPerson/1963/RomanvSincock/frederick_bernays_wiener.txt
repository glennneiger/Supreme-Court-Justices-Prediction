mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
appeal
of
the
state
election
officials
in
the
delaware
reapportionment
case.
i
shall
cover
three
topics,
none
of
which
simply
repeat
what
was
argued
here
last
month
in
the
other
state
cases.
first,
i
will
discuss
the
meaning
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
this
connection
with
particular
reference
to
contemporaneous
construction
and
enforcement
of
that
clause.
and
second,
i
will
discuss
the
contemporaneously
articulated
reasons
underlying
the
1963
amendment
of
the
delaware
constitution
which
the
judgment
below
struck
down.
and
finally,
i
will
discuss
with
your
honors
the
haste
with
which
the
district
court
proceeded
allowing
the
state
of
delaware
13
calendar
days
to
amend
its
constitution
which
worked
out
to
two
legislative
days.
now,
i'll
start
with
the
contemporaneous
construction
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
i'll
start
there
for
the
same
reason
that
any
construction
of
the
constitution
itself,
the
instrument
--
the
basic
instrument
must
start
with
the
records
of
the
federal
convention
and
must
face
some
heat
to
what
the
--
its
framer
said
in
the
federals.
now
the
date
and
points
for
the
fourteenth
amendment
on
the
due
process
clause
are
these,
first
is
june
1866,
when
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
submitted
to
the
states
for
ratification.
second
is
march
1867,
when
the
first
reconstruction
act
was
passed
and
the
third
is
june
1868,
when
seven
former
confederate
states
were
readmitted
or
at
least
their
readmission
was
outright.
these
steps
had
been
very
recently
reviewed
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
florida
in
the
323rd
united
states.
but
i
think
it
will
be
helpful
if
i
recall
just
what
it
was
--
just
what
the
four
steps
were
that
the
basic
reconstruction
act
lay
down.
first,
it
was
required
that
these
10
southern
states
which
had
been
subjected
to
military
government
would
draft
and
ratify
new
state
constitutions
in
conformity
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
in
all
respects.
and
the
second
step
was
that
these
constitutions
would
be
examined
and
approved
by
the
congress.
and
the
third
step
was
that
the
several
states
seeking
readmission
to
congress
would
ratify
the
then
pending
fourteenth
amendment.
and
the
fourth
requirement
was
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
become
a
part
of
the
constitution
and
then
and
only
then
would
those
states
be
readmitted
to
representation
in
congress.
one
of
the
states
that
drafted
a
new
state
constitution
in
conformity
to
this
command
was
florida.
the
boundary
clause
of
which
was
before
your
honors
in
u.s.
v.
florida.
and
under
that
constitution,
each
county
was
entitled
to
at
least
one
representative.
now,
the
counties
varied
in
size
from
some
12,000
people
down
to
83
and
i
am
using
the
1860
census.
solicitor
general
says
well,
we'll
use
the
1870
because
the
civil
war
brought
grave
relocations
of
population.
true
enough,
we
recognized
that.
but
the
congress
in
1868
couldn't
pierce
the
veil
of
the
future
and
look
at
the
1870
census
reports.
so
looking
at
the
18
census
figures,
the
last
available,
with
these
population
figures
that
i
have
indicated
for
the
high
and
low
of
the
florida
counties
and
making
three
deductions,
first
for
minority,
second
for
femininity
because
women
couldn't
vote
that
time
and
third,
for
apathy.
we
came
up
with
the
figure
of
24
voters
in
the
smallest
county
which
meant
a
ratio
in
the
lower
house
of
74-to-1.
now,
the
omnibus
bill
which
readmitted
six
states
had
originally
not
included
florida.
florida
was
added
by
the
senate
and
when
the
senate
amendments
came
back
to
the
house
for
concurrence
or
rejection,
the
gentlemen
in
the
house
got
up
and
it
moved
to
strike
out
florida
from
the
senate
objection
--
from
the
senate
amendment
saying,
"i
might
refer
to
the
apportionment
of
representatives.
by
this
constitution,
representatives
in
the
legislature
of
florida
are
apportioned
in
such
a
manner
as
to
give
to
the
sparsely
populated
portions
of
the
state
the
control
of
the
legislature."
skipping
a
sentence,
"by
this
constitution,
every
county
in
that
state
is
entitled
to
a
representative.
there
are
in
that
state
counties
that
have
not
30
registered
voters,
yet
under
this
constitution,
every
one
of
those
counties
is
entitled
to
a
representative
in
the
legislature
while
the
populous
counties
are
entitled
to
only
one
representative
each
with
an
additional
representative
for
every
thousand
inhabitants."
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
is
in
our
replied
brief,
your
honor,
starting
at
page
11.
it
is
from
the
congressional
flow.
well,
the
--
his
motion
to
strike
florida
out
of
the
omnibus
bill
was
rejected
and
among
those
voting
to
reject
his
amendment
were
mr.
benjamin
butler
of
massachusetts,
and
certainly
was
no
southern
sympathizer
or
copperhead.
mr.
thaddeus
stevens
of
pennsylvania
who
was
the
father
of
the
reconstruction
and
mr.
john
a.
bingham
of
ohio
and
mr.
bingham
was
the
man
who
was
the
draftsman
of
the
second
sentence
of
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
one
that
contains
the
privileges,
immunity
--
and
immunities
clause,
the
due
process
clause
and
the
equal
protection
clause.
now,
when
he
presented
his
amendment
during
the
drafting
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
this
is
what
he
said,
reading
from
page
25
of
the
reply
brief,
"the
amendment
does
not
give,
as
the
second
section
shows,
the
power
to
congress
of
regulating
suffrage
in
the
several
states.
the
second
section
excludes
the
conclusion
that
by
the
first
section,
suffrage
is
subjected
to
congressional
law."
and
this
was
concurred
in,
i
have
it
on
the
next
page,
by
senator
howard
of
michigan
who
was
a
radical
republican
and
the
proponent
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
but
served
the
first
section
of
the
proposed
amendment
does
not
give
the
right
of
voting.
the
right
of
suffrage
is
nearly
the
creature
of
law.
it
does
not
regarded
as
one
of
those
fundamental
rights
lying
at
the
basis
of
all
society
and
without
which
the
people
cannot
exist
except
as
slaves.
and
that
representative,
if
the
court
please,
that
represented
the
general
contemporaneous
understanding
because
if
it
happened,
why
did
they
bother
to
pass
the
fifteenth
amendment
which
dealt
specifically
with
the
right
to
vote?
and
the
part
of
which
would've
been
plainly
surplusage
if
the
right
to
vote
without
discrimination
had
been
extend
by
the
equal
protection
clause.
moreover
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
i
cannot
tell
if
there
was
provision
for
senatorial
districts
to
be
created
by
the
legislature.
it
is
not
clear
at
all
from
the
face
of
the
constitution
whether
it
was
to
be
apportioned
according
to
population
or
according
to
political
subdivisions.
now,
congress
in
proposing
the
fifteenth
amendment
of
the
states
obviously
thought
that
something
more
was
necessary.
and
more
than
that,
by
the
time
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
had
been
proposed
to
the
states,
there
were
still
four
former
confederate
states
that
were
in
fact
in
congress.
and
congress
passed
two
statutes
laying
down
an
additional
condition
for
the
readmission
of
those
four
states,
namely,
the
ratification
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
as
well.
and
that
understanding
was
plain
also
to
this
court
and
i
refer
to
the
case
of
minor
against
happersett
in
the
21st
of
wallace
and
this
is
what
you
--
the
court
said,
"and
still
again,"
page
30
of
the
reply
brief."
and
still
again,
after
the
adoption
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
was
deemed
necessary
to
adopt
the
fifteenth
as
follows,"
and
then
they
quote,
"the
fourteenth
amendment
had
already
provided
that
no
state
should
make
or
enforce
any
law
which
would've
bri
--
which
should've
bridged
the
privileges
or
immunities
of
citizens
of
the
united
states."
if
suffrage
was
one
of
it,
these
privileges
or
immunities,
why
amend
the
constitution
to
prevent
its
being
denied
on
the
count
of
race
et
cetera?
nothing
is
more
evident
than
that
the
greater
must
include
the
less.
and
if
all
were
already
protected,
why
go
through
with
the
form
of
amending
the
constitution
to
protect
the
party?
now,
minor
v.
happersett
was
the
claim
of
a
missouri
lady,
mrs.
minor,
to
vote.
she
said,
she
was
a
citizen
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
she
had
a
right
to
vote.
and
this
court
unanimously
held
that
she
had
no
rights
either
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
under
the
guarantee
clause.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
women
had
no
federally
protected
right
to
vote
until
the
nineteenth
amendment
and
part
of
that
would've
been
surplusage.
now,
if
the
equal
protection
clause
of
its
own
force
had
wiped
out
all
discriminations
in
respect
to
the
exercise
of
voting
rights,
why
was
it
necessary
to
bother
with
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
make
those
last
southern
states
ratify
it
and
why
was
it
necessary
to
follow
with
the
nineteenth
amendment?
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
--
i'm
inclined
to
think
that
that
follows
but
i
don't
go
that
far.
what
our
position
briefly
is
that
having
regard
to
that
very
fragile
foundation,
it
will
not
support
the
burden
that
was
sought
to
be
placed
on
it
by
the
arguments
last
month,
namely,
that
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
both
houses
of
a
legislature
to
be
apportioned
according
to
population
or
that
--
and
this
was
actually
the
holding
below
that
the
equal
protection
clause
somehow
or
rather
incorporates
the
multiplication
tables.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
--
that
may
well
be.
i
just
--
i
just
was
not
able
to
run
it
down
with
the
data
at
hand
and
certainly,
it
wasn't
before
congress.
but
going
back
to
1868
and
i
think
the
contemporaneous
construction
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
particularly
significant
in
view
of
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
gave
the
congress
power
to
enforce
the
entire
amendment
by
appropriate
legislation.
now,
your
honors'
opinion
in
united
states
v.
florida
shows
the
care
with
which
these
constitutions
were
examined
and
there
are
three
other
aspects
of
that
careful
meticulous
microscopic,
i
think,
one
member
of
congress
said
examination.
when
florida,
as
i've
indicated
state
in
the
bill,
when
the
senators
from
florida
presented
themselves,
there
was
violent
debate
not
over
the
malapportionment
in
the
legislature,
the
debate
extended
for
10
printed
pages
over
whether
florida
which
had
adopted
the
fourteenth
amendment,
quote
adopted,
in
conformity
with
section
5
of
the
reconstruction
act
but
hadn't
ratified
it
in
conformity
with
using
the
language
of
the
omnibus
readmission
act
of
1868
whether
that
was
a
compliance
and
they
talked
for
10
printed
pages
about
that.
then,
the
south
carolina
constitution
came
up.
the
south
carolina
constitution
of
1868
arranged
its
legislature
basically
on
the
federal
pattern.
the
lower
house
according
to
population,
the
senate
according
to
counties,
one
senator
for
each
county
except
charleston
county
which
would
have
two,
applying
the
1860
census
figures
conscious
that
those
were
not
accurate
because
after
all,
carolina
--
south
carolina
was
that
they
are
a
seed
of
the
theatre
of
war
but
they
were
the
only
ones
available.
we
find
a
discrepancy
between
senatorial
districts
of
5.2-to-1.
in
the
same
way,
georgia
had
a
constitution
that
follow
the
fed
--
that
constructed
its
legislature
on
the
federal
pattern.
its
house
according
to
population,
its
senate
by
groups
of
three
contiguous
counties
each.and
the
discrepancy
in
respect
of
the
senators
to
which
came
to
5.7-to-1.
now,
it
is
even
more
significant
in
the
case
of
georgia
because
it
took
three
separate
acts
for
georgia
to
get
back
into
the
congress.
first,
they
would
--
it
was
permitted
in
under
the
blanket
of
the
omnibus
act
of
june
1868
and
they
went
to
work
and
they
drafted
their
constitution.
they
set
up
a
legislature
then
they
admitted
of
a
--
ejected
a
negro
member
and
they
substitute
it
in
his
place
an
ex-confederate
brigadier
and
that
rouse
the
congress
and
they
put
georgia
back
under
reconstruction
the
second
act
of
december
1869
and
added
the
condition
of
ratifying
the
fifteenth
amendment
also.
and
then
general
meade
and
his
officers
went
through
the
georgia
legislature
with
the
fine-tooth
comb
and
finally
they
got
a
legislature
that
satisfied
at
least
those
who
examined
it
and
then
congress
passed
a
third
act
in
july
of
1870
to
readmit
georgia
finally
and
the
georgia
senators
finally
took
their
seat
in
--
in
the
senate
in
1871
but
nowhere
during
any
of
those
discussions
on
the
omnibus
act
of
1968
on
the
further
reconstruction
act
of
december
1869
or
on
the
final
readmission
act
of
july
1870
was
there
a
word
said
by
any
one
anywhere?
we
cannot
readmit
the
state
of
georgia
because
its
legislature's
inconsist
--
is
formed
in
a
manner
inconsistent
with
the
equal
protection
clause
on
the
multiplication
tables.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
think
it
--
well,
i'd
--
i
don't
know.
i
just
don't
know,
your
honor
because
it
would
be
a
hypothesis
on
my
part.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
--
your
honor,
i
just
don't
know
because
i
never
had
the
time
to
run
down
the
other
--
the
florida
senate
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
to
see
whether
it
was
one
or
the
other.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
--
i
am
--
our
position
is
we're
asking
that
baker
v.
carr
be
applied
as
written,
namely,
the
well
developed
and
familiar
standards
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
what
i'm
trying
to
say
here
is
that
those
standards
do
not
include
the
proposition
that
both
houses
of
a
state
legislature
must
be
apportioned
primarily
according
to
population.
and
i
think
it's
particularly
important
here
because
when
the
same
congress
that
was
readmitting
florida
and
georgia
and
south
carolina
when
the
same
congress
was
in
a
field
where
it
was
master,
namely,
the
territories
under
article
iv.
when
it
organized
territories,
it
provided
for
the
both
houses
to
be
apportioned
according
to
population.
it
was
a
boilerplate
provision
that
we
have
found
in
14
territorial
organic
acts
from
the
mexican
war
through
1868
and
my
guess
would
be
that
probably
it
existed
earlier.
i
haven't
gone
earlier
because
i
have
sought
contemporaneous
construction.
now,
that
is
very
important
because
its
--
it
illustrates,
it
--
it
indicates
that
congress
made
a
--
drew
a
line
between
what
it
considered
desirable
political
standards
and
constitutional
compulsion.
when
it
was
left
to
its
own,
it
set
both
houses
according
to
population
and
we
have
cited
acts
where
giving
the
governor
power
to
reapportion
when
the
territorial
legislatures
failed
to
do
so
or
did
so
improperly.
but
when
it
came
to
constitutional
compulsion,
there
is
no
constitutional
compulsion
that
requires
the
second
house
of
a
state
--
of
a
state
legislature
to
be
apportioned
according
to
population.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
it's
very
difficult
to
spell
constitutional
compulsion
which
respect
to
voting
rights
out
of
fourteenth
--
out
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
i
mean
after
all
minor
v.
happersett,
now,
whatever
else
can
be
said
about
your
honors
predecessors
on
this
bench
in
1875,
they
were
closer
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
its
adoption
and
they
didn't
have
to
indulge
in
recondite
start
or
research
and
thumb
through
dreary
pages
of
congressional
debates
to
find
out
what
it
meant.
they
were
there.
they
were
then
mature
men
in
their
professional
prime.
they
knew
what
it
meant
and
it
never
occurred.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
and
--
and
--
we
--
we
accept
that.
what
we
say
is,
you
--
its
--
it
is
not
a
firm
foundation
on
which
you
can
build
these
mathematical
tables
in
the
both
houses
according
to
population
and
that
reject
every
proposition
that
we've
ever
had
because
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
exactly,
and
we
--
we're
entirely
satisfied
with
--
with
that.
and
what
--
i'm
now
going
on
to
say
your
honor
is
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
i'm
coming
to
that.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
argument
for
the
appellants
here
has
roots
to
go
far
deeper
than
a
construction
of
what
congress
did
or
did
not
do
at
the
most
critical
period.
the
congress
is
nearest
in
time
to
the
drafting
the
submission,
the
ratification
and
the
enforcement
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
am
--
i'm
afraid
i
--
i
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
they
were
talking
about
the
--
the
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
they
weren't
talking
about
justiciable,
they
weren't
talking
about
the
political
question
but
they
were
talking
about
the
scope
of
the
first
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
then
they
proceeded
to
pass
the
fifteenth
then
ran
part
of
that
fifteenth
down
southern
throats.
but
far
more
deep-seated,
we
think,
than
the
question
of
the
original
scope.
the
--
to
affirm
the
--
the
judgment
below
which
deny
the
state
the
power
to
construct
its
federal
--
its
legislature
on
the
federal
pattern
that
is
one
house
not
apportioned
according
to
population
at
all
to
use
the
language
of
the
reservation
in
gray
v.
sanders.
affirmance
of
that
judgment
would
involve
two
unacceptable
incongruities.
it
would
amount
to
a
holding
that
there
is
forever
embedded
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
ineradicable
discrimination,
a
denial,
if
you
please,
of
the
substance
of
equal
protection
to
the
people
of
the
most
populous
states.
now,
the
population
disparities
in
delaware
and
delaware
has
only
three
counties,
your
honor,
three
counties
and
one
of
them
has
about
69%
of
the
population.
the
other
two
have
31%
of
the
population.
there's
a
lot
of
been,
a
lot
of
talk
last
month
and
then
the
briefs
filed
last
month
about
the
principles
of
majority
rule
and
voter
equality
being
at
the
very
foundational
stone
of
our
principle
of
government
but
the
united
states
constitution
has
a
build
in
guarantee
of
minority
rule
in
one
house
and
that
can't
be
--
when
i
say
build
in,
i
mean
it
can't
be
changed.
article
v,
the
amending
article,
doesn't
permit
to
represent
the
senatorial
representation
to
be
changed.
now,
that
comes,
that
comes
under
the
1960
census
to
a
majority
of
the
senate
representing
16%
of
the
population.
and
when
you
subtract
the
40%
of
the
population
who
are
minors,
40%
are
minors
and
then
60%
of
those
who
are
eligible
on
paper
don't
work
--
don't
vote
either
because
of
apathy
or
because
they
can't
qualify
to
--
having
been
there
long
enough
to
register.
and
take
off
60%
again
to
see
who
gets
elected
because
after
all
60%
is
a
landslide.
the
result
is
that
something
around
4%
of
the
population
or
a
little
less,
4%
of
the
population
elects
the
majority
of
the
senate
of
the
united
states.
now,
if
the
basic
design
of
the
delaware
1963
reapportionment
which
gives
to
each
of
the
three
counties
equal
representation
in
the
delaware
senate,
if
that
is
to
be
held
bad
as
the
district
court
here
held
it
bad,
then
your
honors
have
in
effect
said
well,
we
can't
change
it
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
but
it's
an
invidious
discrimination
against
new
york
and
california
and
massachusetts
and
ohio
and
all
--
illinois
and
all
the
large
states.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
is
correct.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
your
honor.
i
expect
to
cover
that.
i
think
it
will
--
i
think
it
will
appear
more
intelligibly
in
its
setting
if
i
--
if
i
take
it
later
but
i
expect
to
--
i'd
expect
to
discuss
that.
as
--
now,
the
second
unacceptable
incongruity
that
the
holding
below
involved
is
this,
that
the
whole
notion
of
checks
and
balances
is
bad
because
it
prevents
the
will
of
the
majority
from
being
translated
into
immediate
action.
i
think
if
we,
if
we
go
back
to
the
fundamentals,
we
see
that
the
basic
principle
underlying
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
checks
and
balances
not
the
nose
count.
let
me
take
some
familiar
examples
just
to
recall
them
to
mind,
a
bill
passed
by
a
house
of
representative
apportioned
according
to
population
can
be
rejected
by
a
senate
in
which
the
majority
represents
less
than
one-sixth
of
the
population.
a
bill
passed
by
--
by
both
houses
of
congress
can
be
vetoed
by
a
president
who
was
elected
indirectly.
a
bill
passed
by
congress
and
approved
by
the
president
can
be
struck
down
by
this
court
for
being
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
only
--
the
reason
we
have
checks
and
balances
is
because
it's
the
only
way
to
protect
minorities.
if
you
want
an
almost
laboratory
example
of
instant
effect
to
a
momentary
majority
community
decision,
i
don't
know
of
any
better
example
than
a
lynching
that
gives
instant
effect
without
any
checks
or
any
balances.
now,
what
are
some
legal
aspects
of
checks
and
balances?
if
you
have
a
legislature,
one
house
of
which
is
arranged
on
the
federal
pattern,
the
governor
is
still
elected
at
large
and
you
will
have
the
majority
expressing
their
influence
not
only
in
the
election
of
the
governor
but
in
the
control
of
the
executive
department
with
all
its
control
over
patronage
that
the
holder
of
the
governor's
chair
and
the
majority
party
can
exercise
and
that
extends,
of
course,
to
all
kinds
of
appointments
in
delaware
to
the
commissions
only
partly
to
the
--
to
the
judges
because
they're
required
to
be
bipartisan
but
the
governor
has
the
power
of
selection
and
that
is
the
mighty
power
which
can
be
exercised
with
infinite
influence
on
the
future
of
the
state.
now,
there
was
talk
here
last
month
about
the
legislative
deadlock.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
deadlock.
legislative
deadlock.
now,
legislative
deadlock
is
an
expression
of
preference
for
a
particular
kind
of
legislation.
let
me
take
an
example
close
to
that.
the
house
of
representatives
has
passed
a
bill
to
repeal
the
mallory
rule.
that
bill
is
in
the
senate
and
according
to
those
who
are
pretty
good
prognosticators
that
hasn't
got
a
chance
of
passing
the
senate.
now,
if
you
don't
like
the
mallory
rule,
this
is
an
example
of
legislative
deadlock
because
it
prevents
its
repeal.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
agree
that
the
mallory
rule
is
a
sound
and
civilized
rule
of
the
--
for
the
administration
of
criminal
justice,
then
the
circumstance
shows
the
great
wisdom
of
the
framers
in
providing
for
a
bicameral
legislature.
and
that's
the
difficulty
with
talk
about
legislative
deadlock.
it
involves
a
--
a
--
if
i
may
lapse
in
the
socio
--
sociological
jargon,
it
involves
a
value
judgment
on
particular
bills.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
precisely.
now,
there
had
been
proposals,
of
course,
to
--
to
get
the
nose
count
principle
into
the
administration
of
justice,
your
honors.
remember
50,
60
years
ago,
there
was
a
great
campaign
for
the
repeal
of
judicial
decisions.
and
now,
if
you
got
to
--
recall
that,
sorry
i
misspoke,
recall
of
judicial
decisions
in
--
in
criminal
cases
to
recall
judicial
decisions
might
verge
on
the
bill
of
attainder.
you
can't
--
you
simply
--
the
basic
--
the
underlying
principle,
the
fundamental
premise
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
checks
and
balances
because
that
is
the
only
way
to
protect
minorities.
now,
the
paradox,
the
ironic
paradox
of
this
case
is
that
the
plaintiffs
have
appealed
to
the
checks
and
balances
machinery
of
judicial
review
in
order
to
remove
the
principle
of
checks
and
balances
from
the
constitution
of
delaware.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
now
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes
sir.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
the
--
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
lays
down
a
very
specific
formula
that
says
that
the
house
shall
be
apportioned
according
to
population.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
exactly
and
--
and
as
i
will
say
--
as
i
will
show,
this
was
the
effort
in
delaware
to
apportion
the
house
according
to
population.
and
the
only
reason
they
were
not
able
to
do
so
is
because
of
the
shortness
of
time.
the
complaint
made
in
the
opinion
below
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
13
calendar
days
which
added
up
to
two
legislative
days.
that's
all
the
time
they
would
give
us.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
is
all.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
sir.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
district
court
says,
“well,
this
is
a
very
unfair
system.
new
castle
county
pays
most
of
the
taxes.
it
should
have
most
of
the
votes.”
well,
that's
a
curious
resurrection
of
the
old
federalist
notion
that
government
should
be
restricted
to
the
wise,
the
good
and
the
rich.
and
we
say
that
there's
nothing
in
the
equal
protection
clause
that
forever
subjects
the
few
and
the
poor
to
the
domination
of
the
many
and
the
rich.
now,
when
i
say
protecting
minorities,
they're
all
kinds
of
minorities.they're
racial
minorities.
you
can
see
the
--
you
can
see
those
very
clearly
because
all
you
have
to
do
is
look
at
the
man.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
but
it's
also
got
a
lot
of
very
plush
executives,
your
honor.
it's
got
the
--
it's
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
in
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
“rural”
new
castle
county,
i
would
--
if
--
is
it
permissible
to
go
on
to
party
distribution?
but
most
of
the
republicans
in
the
state
live
in
a
“rural”
new
castle
county.
now,
it's
--
it
has
housing
developments,
yes.
it
has
housing
developments
but
it
has
also
a
lot
of
very
lovely
expensive
suburban
homes.
it's
like
--
there
are
various
kinds
of
minorities.
there's
the
minority
you
can
easily
see,
the
racial
minority.
there
is
the
religious
minority.
there
is
the
minority
that
is
unpopular
because
of
the
beliefs
that
it
holds.
and
finally,
there
is
the
minority
of
the
downstate
--
two
downstate
counties
in
delaware
who
are
a
minority
only
in
the
sense
that
they're
small.
they
only
represent
31%
of
the
people
and
they
prefer
not
to
be
kicked
around
by
the
other
69%.
now,
i
think
we
--
the
court
can
avoid
both
the
incongruities
that
i
have
mentioned
and
can
avoid
passing
judicial
comment
on
political
theories
if
we
stick
to
baker
v.
carr
as
written.
let
me
recur
to
the
heart
of
that
decision,
page
226,
“judicial
standards
under
the
equal
protection
clause
are
well
developed
and
familiar
and
it
has
been
opened
to
courts
since
the
enactment
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
determine
if
on
the
particular
facts
they
must
that
a
discrimination
reflects
no
policy
but
simply
arbitrary
and
capricious
action.”
now,
i
would
like
to
review
briefly
what
those
well
developed
and
familiar
standards
are.
we've
done
so
in
our
reply
brief,
which
by
the
way
is
--
contains
a
great
deal
of
new
material
because
of
the
deadlines
we
were
under
about
two-thirds
of
it
has
new
material
only
one-third
reply.
there's
been
an
ebb
and
flow
over
the
years
which
in
the
related
field
of
the
due
process
clause,
your
honors,
have
only
very
recently
reviewed
in
the
case
of
ferguson
against
skrupa.
and
as
an
essential
similarity
between
the
construction
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
due
process
clause,
both
are
generally
--
generalized
commands
in
--
with
very
vague
contours,
the
problem
is
essentially
the
same.
now,
under
the
due
process
clause,
we
think
there
are
four
standards
for
well
developed
and
familiar
standards
to
be
drawn
from
the
cases.
in
the
first
two
things
and
most
important
of
these
is
that
the
equal
protection
clause
should
--
cannot
properly
--
should
not
properly
be
used
as
a
vehicle
to
erect
personal
preferences
and
sociology
or
economics
or
political
theory
into
constitutional
absolutes.
and
the
second
principle
is
that
we
don't
use
the
equal
protection
clause
to
stop
experimentation
in
the
insulated
chambers
of
the
several
states.
and
the
third
principle
is
that
we
don't
use
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
overturn
long
settled
principles
particularly
fourth
in
the
area
of
poli
--
the
exercise
of
political
rights.
and
it
seems
--
seems
to
me
that
this
admonition
is
particularly
significant
here,
where
the
holding
of
the
court
below
would
overturn
the
--
diametrically
the
conception
of
the
equal
protection
clause
held
by
those
who
framed
it
nearly
a
century
ago.
this
court
has,
as
i've
said,
only
very
recently
reviewed
in
ferguson
and
skrupa
a
very
unfortunate
period
of
its
history
when
the
due
process
clause
was
used
to
write
personal
preferences
sincerely
held,
sincerely
held
by
dedicated
judges
writing
those
preferences
into
the
due
process
clause.
now,
there's
no,
and
perhaps
somewhat,
cynical
comment
to
the
effect
that
history
teaches
us
only
that
history
teaches
us
nothing.
i
hope
that
the
history
of
the
due
process
clause
will
be
of
some
service
as
your
honors
sit
down
to
apply
the
equal
protection
clause.
and
i
don't
think
it's
any
different
here
when
you
apply
a
label
of
a
voting
right
as
a
personal
right.
i
don't
think
you
get
very
--
you
assist
analysis
if
you
use
labels.
if
you
apply
the
madison
avenue
approach,
as
i
might
call
it,
to
the
question
of
constitutional
law.
as
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
holmes
for
the
court
in
the
256
united
states
that
the
word
“right”
is
one
of
the
most
deceptive
of
pitfalls.
it
is
so
easy
to
slip
from
a
qualified
meaning
in
the
premise
to
an
unqualified
one
in
the
conclusion.
most
rights
are
qualified.
nobody
was
prevented
from
voting
by
anything
the
election
officials
did.
the
plaintiff
sought
an
injunction
against
the
holding
of
the
1962
election
just
last
year,
they
it
didn't
get
it.
the
district
court
granted
an
injunction
against
any
further
elections
which
was
stayed
by
the
--
by
the
circuit
justice
pending
appeal.
and
if
that
--
but
if
that
injunction
had
remained
enforced,
the
people
who
live
in
the
wilmington
district,
where
the
member
died
last
summer,
would
never
been
able
to
fill
his
seat.
though
the
--
the
only
prevention,
the
only
people
who've
been
prevented
from
voting
are
--
are
those
who
would
have
been
under
the
injunctions.
i
think
also
that
to
deal
with
the
--
the
very
difficult
problem
that
your
honors
have
amiss
in
the
related
cases
to
deal
--
speak
of
this
in
terms
of
personal
rights.
it's
really
to
beg
the
question.
this
isn't
a
matter
of
personal
right.
this
is
a
question
of
the
distribution
of
political
power
under
a
fundamental
instrument
of
government.
in
--
in
the
terms
of
the
whole
(inaudible)
analysis,
it
is
not
a
question
of
right
versus
no
right.
it
is
a
matter
of
competing
claims
of
right.
and
the
two
competing
claims
that
are
asserted
here
and
that
must
be
resolved,
are
the
asserted
right
of
the
new
castle
county
plaintiffs
to
walk
roughshod
over
the
downstate
counties
and
the
asserted
right
of
kent
and
sussex
counties
not
to
be
smothered
by
new
castle
county.
it's
not
a
question
of
rights,
it's
a
power
struggle.
and
all
the
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
exactly,
it's
--
it's
that
kind
of
a
thing.
it's
--
it's
all
these
principles
and
postulates
and
--
that
were
aired
here
last
month.
those
are
--
those
are
very
interesting
for
the
seminar
in
political
science
but
--
but
to
write
them
into
the
constitution
as
absolutes
which
bind
everyone
of
the
50
states,
to
do
that
with
be
--
to
repeat
the
tragic
history
of
the
due
process
clause.
and
now,
against
that
background,
your
honors,
i'm
ready
to
consider
the
delaware
amendment
of
1963
and
i
have
in
mind,
your
honor,
the
particular
question.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
june
--
june
of
1962.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
it
--
it
was.
and
let
me
explain
that
because
it's
one
of
the
factors
that
condition
may
work
of
the
people
who
drew
the
amendment.
the
delaware
constitution
provides
that
for
the
constitution
to
be
amended
leaving
out
of
account
--
a
con
--
a
constitutional
convention,
it
is
necessary
for
an
amendment
to
be
passed
by
a
two-thirds
vote
of
both
houses
of
the
general
assembly,
then
followed
by
a
--
an
intervening
general
assembly
and
then
be
repassed
by
two-thirds
vote
of
both
houses
of
the
next
general
assembly.
the
constitution
also
provides
that
this
amendment
must
be
published
at
least
three
months
before
the
coming
general
election.
the
--
because
of
that,
while
the
bipartisan
committee,
which
i
will
refer
to
in
detail,
was
work,
the
election
officials
asked
for
a
stay.
the
district
court
gave
them
from
july
25
to
august
6
because
there
was
an
election
coming
up
in
--
in
november.
actually,
they
had
only
until
the
30th
of
july
because
the
constitutional
requirement
for
publication
in
the
newspapers
of
each
county
involves
some
counties
or
at
least
one
that
has
only
a
weekly
paper
which
went
to
press
on
the
31st
of
july,
so
that
actually
the
legislature
--
the
--
the
court's
opinion
came
down
on
the
25th
of
july.
the
legislature
was
immediately
convened
in
the
special
session
on
the
27th.
the
29th
was
a
sunday
and
they
had
to
be
through
by
the
30th.
now,
if
the
district
court
has
said,
“alright,
we
can't
make
it
in
a
hurry
now.”
why
not
take
the
first
leg
of
a
constitutional
amendment
for
the
1963,
1964
session
and
get
the
next
one
passed
by
1965.
that
would've
given
ample
time
but
the
court
never
allowed
it.
and
--
and
that
was
up
the
--
that
was
--
that
single
factor
conditioned
all
of
the
defects
which
were
recognized
but
in
two
--
in
three
weeks
work
by
the
committee
in
two
days
work
by
the
legislature
was
not
sufficient
either
to
redistrict
the
state.
either
they
come
up
with
a
formula
for
redistricting
or
even
to
consider
the
district
court's
original
suggestion
of
letting
reapportionment
in
delaware
be
regulated
by
statute.
well,
the
--
the
idea
may
have
merit.
it
has
certain
demerits
also.
demerit
number
one,
it
reencountered
to
106
--
186
years
of
delaware
tradition
having
it
in
the
constitution.
demerit
number
two,
it
added
an
element
of
political
instability
because
demerit
number
3,
it
lasted
in
the
power
of
a
party
temporarily
in
control
of
the
--
of
the
legislature
to
divide
up
the
state
to
its
own
advantage.
now,
there
is
a
lot
to
be
said
for
the
district
court's
suggestion
but
i
submit
that
two
legislative
days
isn't
sufficient
to
make
at
a
--
a
knowledgeable
informed
choice
on
such
a
fundamental
and
far
reaching
step.
that's
why
we
say
it
is
the
haste
and
there's
some
other
factors
also.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
no,
no,
i
--
i'm
sorry.
i
then
--
i
then
--
i
haven't
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
i
haven't
made
myself
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
now,
i
say
that
when
you
apply
baker
v.
carr
as
written,
namely,
that
the
only
thing
that
is
condemned
is
arbitrary
action,
capricious
action,
the
action
that
reflects
no
policy
then
it's
bad
and
we
say
ours
qualifies
as
good
within
those
standards.
that's
our
position.
i
want
to
make
that
very
clear.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
that
would
be
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
that
would
be
capricious.
i
think
that
would
be
(voice
overlap).
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
it
would
be
capricious
and
--
and
it
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
because
--
because
the
number
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
of
syllables
on
the
name
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
number
of
--
of
representatives
the
people
should
have.
if
--
if
your
honor
will
let
me
expound
what
these
people
did
here
so
that
the
--
so
that
the
1963
amendment,
as
before
your
honors,
not
in
the
terms
of
the
grammar
school
arithmetic
that
your
honor
decried
last
month
but
in
terms
of
the
principles
that
the
drafting
committee
applied
and
that
they
said
they
applied.
first
--
first,
let
me
state
what
the
apportionment
was
when
the
suit
was
brought.
that
was
under
the
1897
constitution.
“rural”
new
castle,
kent
and
sussex
county
each
had
five
senators.
the
city
of
wilmington
had
two
additional
senators
so
that
new
castle
had
seven,
the
other
two
had
five.
"rural"
new
castle,
kent
and
sussex
each
had
10
representatives
and
the
city
of
wilmington
had
five
so
that
all
of
new
castle
had
15
whereas,
the
other
two
had
10
and
the
boundaries
were
set
up
prescribed
right
in
the
constitution.
now,
the
suit
was
brought
in
june.
the
governor
appointed
the
bipartisan
committee
to
look
into
reapportionment
and
draft
an
amendment
early
in
july.
the
committee
met
throughout
the
month
of
july
and
here
were
the
factors
that
condition
their
work.
first,
as
i've
said,
delaware
has
three
counties
only,
one
of
which
has
69%
of
the
people.
second,
in
delaware
unlike
the
other
states,
and
i'll
take
that
up
in
just
a
minute,
in
delaware,
the
counties
had
made
the
state,
the
state
didn't
make
the
counties.
third
was
the
time
limit,
the
short
time
limit
and
fourth
were
the
amending
requirements
of
the
delaware
constitution
to
which
i
have
already
adverted.
now,
this
--
this
commission
came
up
with
a
new
pattern.
first,
they
equalized
the
senate
seats
so
as
to
give
each
county
seven,
then
they
divided
up
the
largest
representative
districts
on
a
quotient
with
the
result
that
new
castle
county
got
25
instead
of
15
so
there
are
now
45
representatives
in
the
house.
and
third,
there
was
provision
made
for
future
redivisions
dividing
up
of
the
largest
districts
after
each
census.
at
the
same
time
as
the
committee
was
acutely
aware,
the
retention
of
the
existing
districts
made
for
the
continuation
of
the
disproportions
--
population
disproportions
in
the
existing
districts.
and
that
plan
because
largely
--
well,
partly
because
of
those
disproportions
and
partly
because
of
the
adoption
of
the
federal
pattern
was
held
neither
reasonable
nor
rational
by
the
district
court
and
it
is
similarly
denounced
by
our
opponents
here.
our
plaintiff
say
it's
half
hazard.
they
denied
the
existence
of
any
pattern,
it
has
no
reasonable
basis,
it
has
no
rhyme
or
reason,
and
the
solicitor
general
chimes
in
with
a
loud
“me,
too”.
he
says
it's
without
rational
foundation
in
policy,
there's
no
explanation,
represents
a
disingenuous
efforts
as
no
policy
to
support
the
capricious
discriminations
italicizing
“no”,
says
there
are
gross
inequalities
and
finally
winds
up
by
triumphant
peroration
that
it's
a
crazy
quilt
having
neither
rhyme
nor
reason.
but
none
of
the
people,
whose
denunciations
i
have
quoted,
ever
looked
at
the
reasons
given
by
the
people
who
grew
up
the
plan.
now,
it's
true,
they
extend
to
240
printed
pages
in
this
record
and
they
extend
it
to
375
typewritten
pages.
they
were
somewhat
summarized
by
the
chairman
of
the
committee
when
he
testified
but
there
isn't
a
single
reference
to
the
proceedings
of
the
committee.
the
word
for
word
contemporaneous
discussions
not
rationalizations
after
the
event,
we
have
something
that
looks
funny.
let's
see
if
we
can
justify
it
somewhat.
this
is
contemporaneous.
these
are
the
words
just
as
they
were
spoken
and
nobody
looked
in.
now,
i
don't
need
to
recall
to
the
court's
mind
that
some
of
the
court's
decisions
have
not
always
met
with
complete
acceptance
in
the
community.
i
don't
suppose
they
ever
will.
but
recently,
some
members
of
the
court
have
said
and
there
he
justly
you
can
disagree
with
us
if
you
like
but
read
the
opinions
first.
now,
the
people
who
disagree
with
the
1963
delaware
reapportionment
have
never
read
the
opinions.
they
haven't
gone
through
this
to
see
the
reasons
that
were
given
for
arriving
at
this
reapportionment.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
it
was,
sir.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
formula
was
this.
they
took
the
existing
districts,
because
there
wasn't
time
to
change
it.
and
where
there
was
a
district
that
had
over
15,000,
it
would
get
an
additional
representative
for
each
15,000
or
major
fraction
thereof.
that
was
the
formula
that
was
used.
they
wanted
to
apportion
according
to
population.
in
their
second
report,
they
presented
a
plan
which
would
have
apportioned
the
entire
house
on
a
statewide
basis
according
to
population
quotients
but
they
never
got
the
time
to
put
that
into
effect.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
oh,
yes.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
it
did.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
new
castle
county
went
from
15
up
to
25
which
is
55%
of
the
--
of
the
house.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
it's
they
have
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
oh,
yes,
they
--
they
went
from
--
they
went
from
15
to
25
which
i
think
is
from
43%
to
55%.
so
that
the
new
castle
county
now
has
a
majority
of
the
house
and
if
there
had
been
time
to
affect
the
equalization
which
we've
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief,
they
would've
had
pretty
close
to
69%.
it
would've
been
on
a
population
basis.
now,
as
i
sat
down
to
read
these
240
pages
and
that's
a
chore,
of
course.
but
i
--
i
do
think
that
before
a
product
is
denounced,
we
have
to
look
at
the
reasons.
i
was
struck
with
a
similarity
to
our
own
constitutional
convention
in
--
in
1787
and
i
reread
the
summary
of
those
proceedings
by
the
scholar
who
edited
the
records,
professor
ferrandiz
framing
of
the
constitution.
and
they
found
five
points
of
similarity
between
what
was
done
in
--
in
philadelphia
in
1787
and
what
this
bipartisan
committee
did
in
1862.
but
first,
they
preceded
step
by
step,
one
resolution
after
another.
and
then
they
got
snagged
up
in
a
--
in
a
basic
crisis
and
they
surmounted
that
in
a
spirit
of
compromise.
and
after
that,
everything
went
much
more
easily.
and
at
the
end,
they
were
completely
unanimous
and
recognizing,
of
course,
their
--
the
imperfection
of
the
plan.
let
me
--
i've
mentioned
the
bipartisan
commission,
let
me
indi
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
your
honor.
they
--
not
only
might
have,
they
did.
in
the
appendix
to
our
required
brief
at
page
74,
they
came
up
with
that.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
think
--
i
think
to
do
an
effective
job,
they
should
have
allowed
the
general
assembly
that
was
to
be
elected
in
1964
to
have
completed
the
second
leg
of
the
amendment.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
yes,
because
it
have
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
two
successive
general
assemblies.
now,
they
passed
this
one
in
six
months.
i
mean,
because
they
were
--
one
was
in
july
of
1962.
there
was
a
general
election
close
at
hand
then
they
--
they
repassed
it
in
january
1963.
and
the
--
the
other
reason
why
we
--
and
i'm
--
we'll
go
on
to
that
in
detail
a
little
later.
the
other
reason
why
we
say
we
should've
had
more
time
is
--
is
here
was
--
here
was
an
order
to
sail
on
an
uncharted
sea.
we
don't
know
yet
what
the
standards
are
but
i'll
--
i'll
come
to
that
later.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
it
would
be
in
a
very
different
position
but
that
was
precisely
what
the
bipartisan
committee
wasn't
going
to
do.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
was
precisely
what
they
weren't
going
to
do.
they
weren't
going
to
stand
still
and
--
and
continue
the
old
reapportionment.
they
--
i
mean,
there
was
a
--
may
i
answer
that
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
question
by
--
by
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
some
introductory
(voice
overlap).
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
this
bipartisan
committee
was
composed
of
eight
members,
four
from
new
castle
county,
two
from
each
of
the
downstate
counties.
both
parties
were
equally
represented,
two
republicans
and
two
democrats
from
new
castle,
one
each
from
sussex
and
kent
and
they
were
all
unanimous.
now,
the
basic
premises
and
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
this
will
answer
your
question.
the
basic
premises
were
these.
they
had
studied
baker
v.
carr
and
they
knew
that
their
task
was
to
draw
a
rational
plan
which
would
not
be
--
create
an
invidious
discrimination.
that's
perfectly
apparent
from
the
--
from
the
discussions
and
out
of
the
eight,
six
were
lawyers.
they
were
keenly
aware
that
legislative
apportionment
was
better
than
judicial
apportionment.
they
knew
that
what
they
have
had
to
be
palatable
to
four
--
the
four
groups
in
the
general
assembly,
upstate,
downstate,
republicans,
democrats.
they
knew
they
had
to
persuade
the
--
and
convince
the
district
court
that
they
were
acting
in
good
faith.
they
were
keenly
aware
of
the
pressure.
and
they
--
and
they
--
they
were
right.
the
--
the
court
wouldn't
give
them
until
1965.
and
they
also
knew
that
in
the
time
available,
they
couldn't
propose
an
ideal
solution
because
the
time
didn't
permit
redistricting.
well,
they
came
up
with
--
with
13
steps,
all
of
them
unanimous.
first,
they
decided
the
bicameral
legislature,
then
they
decided
that
the
senate
should
be
apportioned
on
a
rational
geographical
basis,
then
they
came
up
with
equal
county
representation
in
the
senate.
i
think
this
is
probably
as
appropriative
places
any
for
me
to
mention
delaware
history
very
briefly.
it's
fully
documented
in
our
brief
but
the
number
of
it
for
present
purposes
is
that
delaware
was
formed
by
a
union
of
counties.
the
counties
were
not
made
by
the
state
and
the
knob
of
this
is
that
after
june
1776,
when
they
threw
off
the
yoke
of
the
crown,
the
three
counties,
the
three
lower
counties
on
delaware
were
sovereign
in
the
sense
that
each
was
free
to
go
its
own
way
that
it
didn't
have
to
join
together.
they
could've
gone
their
own
way
and
both
of
the
experts
on
both
sides
agreed
at
the
trial.
and
in
september
1776,
the
three
lower
counties
formed
the
delaware
state.
they
weren't
really
a
political
unit
until
then.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
they
had
a
common
assembly
that
the
legitimacy
of
which
was
denied
by
so
(inaudible)
a
lawyer
as
lord
mansfield
when
he
was
attorney
general,
sir
william
merck
and
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
well
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
they
were
functioning
but
the
--
the
common
assembly
was
much
less
of
a
bond
joining
the
three
lower
counties
whenever
the
articles
of
confederation
were
joining,
this
--
the
states
that
had
declared
themselves
independent
in
july
1776
because
if
you
read
the
articles
of
confederation,
you'll
know
the
powers
of
each
and
everything
is
spelled
out.
the
--
the
all
you
find
as
to
fundamental
law
for
the
three
lower
counties
is
one
paragraph
of
william
penn's
charter
of
liberties
that
the
territories,
which
was
another
name
for
the
three
lower
counties,
may
have
a
distinct
assembly.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
they
--
they
considered
themselves
a
government
also.
but
it
was
a
government
in
which
each
of
the
counties
were
separately
represented
and
they
were
referred
to
by
all
contemporaries
and
in
the
journals
of
the
continental
congress
says
the
lower
counties
and
on
the
question
of
where
they
bound
together
so
that
they
either
had
to
be
independent
or
join
pennsylvania
or
join
maryland
or
could
they
go
their
own
ways.
they
could
go
their
own
ways.
and
certainly,
i
mean,
that
the
bond
linking
them
was
far
more
tenuous
and
far
less
specific
than
the
bond
linking
these
states
under
the
articles
of
confederation.
going
back
to
the
committee,
they
decided
to
keep
the
existing
senatorial
districts
and
then,
in
order
to
give
the
lower
county,
the
downstate
counties
two
additional,
they
device
floterial
districts.
that
took
care
of
the
senate.
now,
the
house
was
more
difficult.
there
was
the
same
impossibility
of
redistricting.
there
was
the
strong
probability
of
tremendous
population
growth
in
the
near
future
because
between
1950
and
1960,
kent
had
nearly
doubled.
and
there
was
the
same
difficulty
of
the
imbalances
which
they
recognized
so
their
solution
was
to
add
one
more
representative
in
each
of
the
representative
districts
that
had
over
15,000
in
a
major
fraction.
and
that,
then
they
came
up
against
their
biggest
problem,
house
subdivide
and
that
took
a
considerable
discussion
and
it
--
it
was
finally
settled
at
the
suggestion
of
a
--
a
motion
of
the
wilmington
member,
namely,
subdivide
the
existing
districts
on
this
basis
and
let
kent
and
county
and
sussex
keep
their
own
and
after
each
census,
subdivide
them
again.
in
other
words,
if
a
district
--
if
one
of
the
new
districts
had
15
--
had
22,000
people
which
wouldn't
entitle
it
to
two
representatives,
that
wouldn't
be
conclusive.
the
existing
constitutional
1897
districts
would
be
redivided
after
each
census.
that
was
the
best
they
could
come
up
with
then.
and
then
the
remaining
steps
were
very
easy.
they
provided
for
a
redistricting
commission
to
set
up
these
new
districts,
they
set
up
anti
gerrymander
criteria,
they
set
time
limits
for
redistricting,
they
made
it
subject
to
judicial
review,
they
made
it
enforceable
by
mandamus
and
finally
they
unanimously
approved
the
entire
plan.
and
all
agreed
that
it
was
a
step
forward
and
all
agreed
it
was
imperfect.
well,
it
was
a
compromise.
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
in
the
well-worn
phrase
was
a
bundle
of
compromises
and
yet
the
district
court
criticized
the
plan
because
it
represented
the
compromise.
now,
in
the
light
of
these
criteria
which
we
have
summarized
to
point
three
of
our
reply
brief
beginning
at
page
42
of
that
document
ease
somewhat
the
task
of
going
through
these
voluminous
materials.
we
don't
think
that
the
plan
deserves
the
strictures
either
of
the
district
court
or
of
our
plan
because
after
all,
what
is
--
what
do
we
mean
by
reason?
as
a
definition
by
mr.
justice
brandeis,
which
i
think
as
good
as
any,
we
call
that
action
reasonable
which
an
informed,
intelligent,
just-minded,
civilized
man
could
rationally
think.
i
think
that
if
any
other
eight
persons
trying
to
reapportion
the
state
of
delaware
in
this
short
time
period
would've
come
up
with
a
very
similar
plan
and
i
don't
think
we
can
charge
them
with
being
irrational
or
unreasonable
because
in
the
time
available,
they
didn't
come
up
with
a
better
plan
or
because
in
1962,
they
didn't
come
up
with
the
plan,
the
--
the
equalization
features
that
they
came
up
with
in
1963.
now,
i
come
to
the
matter
of
the
haste.
this,
after
all,
represents
a
stately
--
what
is
involved
here?
the
principal
litigant
will
not
--
the
docket
litigant
is
the
state
of
the
union.
and
your
honors
indicated
in
the
long
and
bitter
and
hard-fought
virginia
versus
west
virginia
suit,
how
litigation
involving
a
state
of
the
union
should
be
carried
on
slowly
with
all
deliberate
speed
that's
the
source
of
this
oft
recently
repeated
expression
with
all
deliberate
speed
as
virginia
versus
west
virginia.
and
we
will
wait
for
the
next
session
of
--
of
the
legislature
and
we
will
wait
even
when
there
is
only
sought
a
money
judgment,
even
when
the
liability
of
the
defendant
is
clear,
even
when
we
know
down
deep
that
the
defendant
is
dragging
its
feet,
its
feet.
even
then
we
go
slowly.
now,
here,
here
where
we
had
a
matter
affecting
the
very
structure
of
the
state's
government
where
we
had
a
situation
where
the
guidelines
have
not
yet
been
determined,
where
this
court
has
not
spoken
on
the
guidelines
that
governed
legislative
apportionment
within
a
state
legislature.
we
have
first,
what
mr.
justice
clark
called
“blackjacking”
because
that's
what
it
amounts
to.
and
we
have
not
the
standard
of
virginia
versus
west
virginia
but
rather
the
circus
barkers'
“hurry,
hurry,
hurry!”
as
i've
indicated,
i
got
two
calendar
days.
and
then
the
--
the
court
on
two
occasions
said,
"we
must
proceed
promptly."
on
--
throughout
the
trial
and
in
the
later
opinion
that
talked
about
the
--
people
of
delaware
being
caught
in
the
box
of
time,
they
were
constricted
by
a
box
of
time
but
it
was
that
box
was
constructed
by
the
district
court.
and
then
in
its
final
opinion,
the
court
gave
the
legislature
until
the
1st
of
october
to
come
up
with
a
statute
that
would
follow
its
guidelines
and
after
the
appeal
was
noted,
they
refused
to
stay.
they
required
--
the
court
required
the
delaware
general
assembly
to
come
up
with
answers
on
the
1st
of
october,
answers
that
haven't
been
found
here
yet
two
months
later.
take
the
question
of
the
federal
analogy
and
principle.
the
--
the
house
chosen
--
one
house
chosen
without
regard
to
population
used
in
precise
language
of
the
reservation
in
gray
v.
sanders.
the
district
court
rejected
that
in
toto.
the
--
there
were
some
suggestions
that
there
--
they
said
there
can
be
no
wide
deviation
from
the
principle
of
population
representation
in
the
senate.
now,
in
the
--
in
the
bipartisan
committee's
second
report,
they
endeavored
to
correct
these
disproportions
to
which
mr.
--
justice
goldberg
adverted
by
equalizing
the
districts
within
each
county.
and
such
a
--
a
bill
for
that
purpose
actually
passed
the
senate
on
the
day
that
the
stay
pending
appeal
was
granted.
and
there
were
some
suggestions
in
--
in
the
opinions
that
what
was
bad
was
the
lack
of
equalization
of
the
--
of
the
districts
within
each
county.
and
now,
for
the
first
time
in
the
--
in
the
brief
amicus,
we're
told
that
their
redistricting
within
counties
would
be
wrong
because
that
wouldn't
be
the
federal
analogy,
that
to
follow
the
federal
analogy,
they
all
have
to
be
elected
at
large.
well,
the
bipartisan
committee
was
strongly
opposed
to
elections
at
large
within
counties
or
anywhere
else
because
it
defeats
minority
representation
where
your
parties
are
equally
divided
and
you
have
districts,
the
minority
party
can
get
some
representation.
but
if
all
the
seven
senators
regarded
the
elected
at
large,
then
one
party
is
going
to
get
all
of
them
even
though
it
only
controls
51%
of
the
electorate.
these
are
--
these
are
unsolved
questions
on
the
federal
pattern
or
principle
or
model.
as
i
say,
these
are
unsolved
questions
but
the
--
the
delaware
general
assembly
was
directed
to
come
up
with
answers
to
them
two
months
ago.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
nothing
happened.
no
further
action
was
taken
after
the
stay
was
granted
pending
appeal
except
i
think
the
direct
overtaking
of
the
appeal
and
very
considerately
provided
an
appropriation
for
that
purpose.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
but
it
would've
made
the
case
moot.
it
might
have
made
the
case
moot.
they
would
have
stultified
themselves
after
all.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
they
would
have
mooted
the
case
and
stultified
their
--
their
--
themselves
on
--
on
directing
the
appeal.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
only
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
the
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
only
way
--
the
only
way
i
could
answer
that
question,
your
honors,
is
to
say
what
this
court
said
in
the
(inaudible)
in
the
328
united
states,
it's
very
treacherous
business
to
try
to
draw
inferences
from
legislative
silence.
there
are
half
a
dozen
reasons
why
they
could
properly
upheld
up.
they
didn't
say.
now,
the
second
instance
of
pressure
here
has
been
the
prohibiting
the
amendment
of
--
further
amendment
of
the
constitution
because
if
--
if
the
legislature
had
gone
along
and
had
changed
the
--
had
proposed
a
new
constitutional
amendment
to
equalize
the
house
and
senate
--
the
house
districts
within
the
state
and
the
senate
districts
within
the
county.
it
couldn't
have
been
repassed
because
the
injunction
enjoin
the
holding
of
further
elections
so
that
what
the
district
court
did
was
to
prohibit,
to
prevent,
to
render
impossible
any
further
amendment
of
the
delaware
constitution
according
to
its
terms.
it
is
said
here
that
the
legislature
won't
reapportion,
that
it
have
in
the
amicus,
says
it
have
the
opportunity.
well,
there's
really
no
record
support
for
that.
this
isn't
like
baker
v.
carr
where
there
was
a
constitutional
obligation
which
had
been
ignored
for
60
years.
and
13
calendar
days
or
two
legislative
days
isn't
an
opportunity.
and
they
are
--
they
would
go
ahead
if
they
--
if
they
had
the
time
or
if
they
--
if
--
when
the
litigation
comes
to
oppose
but
to
say
that
it
proves
that
the
legislature
is
unwilling
because
they
wouldn't
comply
with
the
deadline
that
had
been
stayed
by
the
circuit
justice
or
to
say
that
they're
unwilling
because
before
baker
v.
carr,
they
never
did
anything.
i
think
those
are
epithets.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
in
--
in
the
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
the
1897
constitution.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
that
was
the
last
one.
and
--
and
once
baker
v.
carr
was
decided,
they
moved
promptly.
now,
one
other
and
final
disturbing
feature
about
this
case
was
that
the
district
court
was
irresistibly
drawn
to
reapportioning
the
state
by
judicial
decree.
they
presented
a
plan.
the
court
presented
a
plan
to
counsel
at
pre-trial
conference
--
at
the
pre-trial
conference.
they
invited
the
witnesses
to
testify
in
the
court's
plan,
then
the
plaintiffs
amended
their
complaint
to
ask
the
court
to
redistrict,
then
the
--
it
might
have
introduced
a
plan
of
their
own.
they
introduced
testimony
on
it
that
the
court
commented
on
the
plaintiff's
plan
at
some
length.
we
think
that
these
actions
far
outweigh
the
pious
disclaimers,
the
--
this
hurts
me
more
than
it
does
you
that
permeate
some
of
the
court's
opinion.
they
had
an
itch,
an
uncontrollable
itch
to
redistrict
by
judicial
decree.
now,
that
would
raise
constitutional
questions
that
have
--
terribly
serious
questions
that
have
never
yet
been
thought
throughout.
there's
one
thing
for
a
court
to
say,
“well,
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
or
this
constitutional
provision
won't
stand
up.”
it's
quite
another
to
say,
"well,
this
won't
stand
up.
we
will
redraft
this
--
the
statute.
and
we
will
--
we
will
rewrite
the
constitution."
so
that
we
say
that
if
your
honors
will
apply
baker
versus
carr
as
written,
apply
the
well
developed
and
familiar
standards
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
reject
the
proposals
being
made
to
ridiculer
philosophies
into
the
equal
protection
clause.
if
you
examine
the
proceedings
of
the
people
who
drafted
this
amendment
under
great
difficulties,
endeavoring
loyally
to
comply
with
the
mandate
of
this
court
in
baker
v.
carr,
endeavoring
to
find
a
rational
plan
that
would
not
represent
an
invidious
discrimination,
you'll
find
that
the
plan
--
does
the
1963
amendment
does
reflect
the
policy.
it
is
not
arbitrary.
it
is
not
capricious.
it
is
action
which
an
informed,
intelligent,
just-minded
civilized
man
could
rationally
think.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
i
will
--
i
will
--
i
can
answer
that
very
simply.
the
irrational
standard
is
the
crazy
quilt.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
if
the
court
please,
there
is
a
tradition
at
the
bar
of
this
court
and
on
one
occasion
when
the
lateness
mr.
justice
mcreynolds
asked
the
question,
he
was
answered
by
the
familiar,
"i
am
coming
to
that
your
honor"
and
he
replied
rather
testily,
"you're
here
now.
the
question
of
the
senate
in
the
delaware
constitution
is
here
now.
"
two
of
the
judges
below
concurred
in
saying
that
it
was
impossible,
it
was
impermissible
to
deviate
from
the
population
factor
as
the
major
factor
in
apportioning
the
senate.
judge
biggs
at
page
a49
and
judge
wright
at
page
a62,
that
problem
is
here.
now,
what
i
have
talked
about
as
the
federal
analogy
what
everyone
else
has
talked
about
federal
analogy
means
basically
a
one
house
not
apportioned
according
to
population.
now,
the
two
ways
of
doing
that
within
the
basic
framework
of
the
delaware
amendment,
one
is
to
have
all
the
senators
at
large
and
the
other
is
to
have
the
senatorial
districts
equalized
within
the
counties
and
the
solicitor
general
has
said
that
you
cannot
expect
anybody
to
vote
away
his
seat,
entrenched
power
is
too
strong
and
that's
the
reason
why
nothing
has
been
equalized.
i
suggest
it
is
not
very
helpful
particularly
with
those
who
--
on
the
part
of
those
who
represent
the
united
states
to
deal
with
questions
of
this
seriousness
in
terms
of
epithets
and
motives.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
when
the
equalizing
bill
which
we
have
in
our
--
in
the
appendix
to
the
reply
brief
got
to
the
senate,
the
delaware
senate
on
the
very
day
that
the
circuit
justice
stayed
the
--
the
injunction,
it
passed
unanimously.
let's
not
have
any
talk
about
entrenched
power.
they
were
prepared
to
equalize
the
--
equalize
the
senate
and
perhaps
vote
away
their
own
seats,
but
the
state
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
yes.
that
dealt
with
the
senate.
that
equalized
the
senate
districts.
page
69
in
their
reply
brief
and
that
passed
the
senate
12
to
nothing.
no
reply
of
absent.
yes,
they
passed
it
and
then
they
didn't
do
anything
more
because
the
case
was
on
appeal,
the
injunction
had
been
stayed
and
judge
biggs
himself
had
said
at
the
trial,
"i
hope
this
case
will
be
appealed
to
the
supreme
court.
"
but
the
delaware
general
assembly
of
the
state
of
delaware
is
powerless
to
amend
its
constitution
if
this
injunction
now
stay
a
pending
appeal
remains
in
effect
because
if
the
delaware
general
assembly
sometime
in
1964
as
soon
as
it
--
as
long
as
it
sits
proceeds
to
do
whatever
this
court's
decision
says
is
necessary,
it
can't
do
it
by
way
of
constitutional
amendment
because
no
subsequent
general
assembly
can
ever
be
elected.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
on
the
basis
that
it
had
the
--
it
had
the
existing
districts,
it
would
--
did
not
have
the
time
in
two
legislative
days
to
change
them
and
it
provided
for
10
additional
representatives
for
new
castle
county,
two
for
wilmington,
eight
for
rural
new
castle
with
provision
for
redistricting
in
the
next
10
years.
and
even
--
even
this
business
of
the
1600,
this
15th
representative
district
block
for
800,
the
court
itself
in
its
own
plan
on
98a
of
the
record
said
there's
a
new
plan
coming
in
here
that
led
1200
people
and
the
committee
recognized
that.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
there
--
there's
no
question
about
it,
your
honor.
there's
no
question
about
it.
we
were
--
the
committee
was
not
able
in
the
three
weeks
it
had
to
redistrict
the
state
and
the
general
assembly
had
very
little
choice.
they
either
would
adopt
the
plan
which
they
did
or
they'd
be
tied
up
the
way
they
are.
i
mean
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i'm

i'm

mr.
frederick

of
the
reply
brief,
the
governor's
message.
this
is
--
this
is
to
the
--
to
the
session,
“unfortunately
the
time
is
short
to
assure
the
passage
of
the
constitutional
amendment
for
reapportionment
within
six
months.
we
must
act
promptly
by
providing
the
necessary
two-thirds
majority
in
the
house
in
order
that
the
first
leg
of
the
amendment
might
be
approved
before
the
3-month
constitutional
period
before
election
begins
to
run
when
notice
must
be
given
in
the
newspapers
of
our
three
counties.”
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
will
continue,
“the
deadline
is

that
was
the
court's
--
mr.

--
deadline.

urge
you
to
act
promptly.”
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
when
was
it
what?
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
oh,
it
could
--
it
could
have
sat
right
at
--
at
least
to
the
general
election
in
november
but
it
could
not
have
passed
the
first
leg
of
--
it
could
not
validly
have
passed
first
leg
of
a
constitutional
amendment
because
the
constitution,
article
xvi,
section
1
requires
that
a
constitutional
amendment
passed
for
the
first
time
by
the
general
assembly
must
be
advertised
for
at
least
three
months
before
the
--
the
intervening
general
election.
it
couldn't
if
it
didn't
act
by
the
30th
of
july,
it
would
have
to
go
over
until
1965
and
nobody
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
they
acted
on
the
30th
of
--
of
july.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
and
then
they
--
then
--
then
when
the
new
general
assembly
came
in
after
the
intervening
general
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
election,
they
passed
it
on
january
1963.
that
is
the
box
of
time
that
the
district
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
court
constructed.
if
the
district
court
had
said,
“well,
this
is
very
complicated,
this
--
we're
now
at
july,
you've
got
to
act
by
august,
that's
too
short
of
time,
we
will
give
you
until
--
through
1965.”
we
could
have
had
a
well
nigh
perfect
but
we
don't
have.
now
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
27th
of
july,
your
honor.
of
june,
i'm
sorry,
june,
27th
of
june.
now,
three
things
happen
on
the
27th
of
june.
your
honor,
granted
the
stay.
the
senate
equalizing,
this
bill
equalizing
senate
district
passed
the
senate,
the
house
bill
to
equalize
representative
districts
throughout
the
entire
state
so
that
each
one
of
the
45
districts
within
the
house
would
have
substantially
the
same
population
that
was
introduced
into
the
house.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
no,
i
--
i
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
i
think
it
was
entirely
proper.
i
think
--
i
think
for
the
district
court
not
to
grant
the
stay
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
as
your
honors
ruling
found.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes,
of
their
population
within
the
counties.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
within
the
county,
equalizing
the
districts
within
the
counties,
seven
senators
for
each
county
equalizing
the
districts
within.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
it
was
just
introduced.
now,
the
purpose,
the
purpose
of
the
--
the
purpose
of
the
bipartisan
committee
was
to
apportion
according
to
population.
the
chairman
said
on
the
stand
in
answer
to
the
question,
"what
prompted
you
to
put
the
house
on
a
population
basis?"
and
the
answer
was,
and
i
admire
his
courage
in
front
of
that
court,
“we
felt
this
court
had
a
gun
at
the
back
of
the
general
assembly
of
delaware
and
we
have
better
apportion
the
house
of
representatives
on
a
population
basis
under
baker
versus
carr
as
fast
as
we
could.”
that's
what
they
set
out
to
do.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
i
don't
know
exactly
but
there'd
be
seven
senators
in
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
each
county.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
and
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
--
to
--
together
majority
of
--
sussex
has
16.5%
and
have
in
kent
would
be
seven
more,
about
23%
which
is
more
generous
than
the
senate
of
the
united
states
where
16.3%
of
the
population
controls
the
--
control
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
i
don't
know
what
percentage
elects
the
two-thirds,
your
honor.
it
would
be
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
31%
--
in
--
in
delaware
31%
would
elect
two-thirds.
what
the
percentages
in
the
united
states
--
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
31%.
now,
we
think
that
unless
rational
and
reasonable
means
personal
preferences,
this
effort
under
these
time
limits,
these
terribly
constricting
time
limits,
passes
a
test
of
rationality.
however,
if
the
matter
needs
to
be
--
if
the
court
feels
that
the
existing
plan
needs
to
be
perfected
before
it
passes
muster
then
we
would
like
to
do
it
by
constitutional
amendments
and
we
can
have
such
a
constitutional
amendment
through
this
general
assembly
and
the
next.
we
think
in
that
event,
the
matter
ought
to
be
returned
with
the
injunction
dissolved
with
directions
per
state
to
permit
us,
to
permit
the
state
of
delaware
to
perfect
the
basic
plan
and
to
affect
the
necessary
equalizations
consistently
with
what
this
court
tell
the
judge
but
do
it
according
to
the
terms
of
the
constitution
of
the
state
and
indicate
how
we
can
equalize.
do
we
need
to
have
everybody
elected
at
large
and
wipe
out
the
minority
interest
in
every
county
or
can
we
do
it
the
way
we
set
out
to
do
it
under
the
second
report
of
the
bipartisan
committee
tying
up
the
inequalities
by
making
every
senate
district
within
the
state
equal.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
1966.
the
--
the
general
assembly,
it's
either
house
of
--
for
only
two
years
and
--
and
in
delaware,
the
--
the
general
assemblies
are
numbered.
every
biennium
has
a
number.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
well,
yes
but
they
have
staggered
terms.
mr.
frederick
bernays
wiener
yes.
the
--
the
one
general
assembly
is
now
sitting
and
i
think
it's
the
122nd,
the
next
will
be
the
123rd,
but
what
we're
principally
concerned
with
and
what
concerns
us
so
very
much
is
the
rejection
of
the
federal
--
basic
federal
pattern
of
area
representation
in
one
house
and
population
representation
on
the
other.
the
whole
of
that
is
outlawed
under
the
equal
protection
clause
means
a
construction
of
that
clause
directly
of
variance
with
what
the
way
congress
construed
it
in
the
case
of
florida
and
south
carolina
and
georgia.
and
mr.
cox’s
the
arguments
here
about
the
congress
not
scrutinizing
the
florida
constitution
are
just
like
mr.
rankins
in
u.s.
v.
florida
but
they
didn't
look
the
boundary.
and
it
would
be
a
construction
also
of
the
equal
protection
clause
that
would
repeat
the
tragic
era
of
the
due
process
clause
construction
that’s
been
so
recently
reviewed
here.
and
it
would
be
a
--
a
result
achieved
not
as
a
matter
of
elasticity
on
a
case
to
case
basis.
but
at
one
fell
swoop,
it
would
--
not
on
the
basis
of
experience
put
overnight
and
it
would
really,
it
would
really
be
amending
the
constitution
with
a
cleaver
and
what
would
be
the
result?
i
think
the
necessary,
the
inescapable
result
is
that
it
would
reduce
the
states
of
the
union
to
mere
geographical
subdivisions
when
their
--
their
instrument
of
government
for
constructing
their
legislature
is
subjected,
it
can
be
subjected
at
the
instance
of
a
single
disgruntled
citizen
to
a
scrutiny
far
more
searching
then
any
of
its
legislation
and
in
the
process
would
be
hurried
and
harried
and
sneered
up
by
those
who
represent
the
united
states
as
completely
inadequate
(inaudible)
efforts.
now,
i
don't
think,
i
don't
think
that
the
states
--
the
relationship
of
the
states
to
the
nation
properly
can
be
the
same
as
the
relationship
of
municipalities
to
a
state.
that
would
be
the
inevitable
consequence
if
a
state
is
denied
in
the
right
to
apportion,
to
mold,
to
construct,
to
--
its
legislature
on
the
federal
pattern
and
the
necessary
consequence
would
be
with
that
kind
of
a
holding
and
the
republic
as
it
has
existed.
our
federate
republic
as
it
has
existed
for
175
years
would
no
longer
be
a
federated
republic.
