chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
may
i
ask,
how
is
the
other
house
under
the
florida
constitution
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
colonel,
suppose
in
florida
the
--
they
have
apportioned
the
other
house,
the
second
house
in
the
same
way
that
they
did
the
one
you
are
talking
about,
would
your
argument
be
the
same
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it's
not
so
very
far
remote.
you
say
in
your
brief
that
the
other
house
wasn't
on
--
in
accordance
with
population
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
either
so,
how
far
could
they
go
if
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
i'm
--
what
i'm
coming
to
was
--
was
this.
i
was
going
to
ask
you
after
that,
if
you
were
asking
us
to
reconsider
baker
versus
carr.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
believe
that
there
is
constitutional
compulsion
that
at
least
one
house
be
according
to
population?
chief
justice
earl
warren
legislative
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
colonel,
i
suppose
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
the
united
states
government
as
you
could
say
for
the
--
the
delaware
state
government
that
the
president
has
the
same
powers
that
the
governor
has
to
influence
legislation,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
in
order
to
make
the
analogy
complete,
is
it
not
necessary
to
take
into
consideration
that
our
constitution
does
require
at
least
one
house
to
be
strictly
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
according
to
population
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
that
if
it
is
not
that
we
--
we
have
a
malapportionment
under
the
constitution?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that's
part
of
the
checks
and
balances.
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
the
court
below
stay
its
hand
for
--
for
a
period
of
time
in
order
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
all
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
they
give?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
colonel,
would
you
said
here
on
this
brief,
as
i
understand
it,
do
you
--
you
do
not
attack
baker
versus
carr.
you
do
say
that
this
case
does
not
meet
the
constitutional
standards
that
would
--
would
make
the
justiciable
issue
under
baker
versus
carr?
chief
justice
earl
warren
perhaps
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
just
want
to
be
straightened
up,
that's
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
colonel,
may
i
ask
you
if
the
--
the
apportionment
of
the
lower
house
was
done
according
to
any
formula?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
formula?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
result?
did
it
--
did
it
give
more
representation
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
proportionate
--
proportionately
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
proportionately?
is
it
proportionately
greater
than
they
had
before?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
much
more
time,
colonel,
need
the
district
court
have
given
in
order
to
accomplish
that
purpose?
i
--
i
realize
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
under
your
constitutional
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
which
requires
two
successive
legislatures.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this,
suppose
that
they
had
given
the
two
successive
legislatures
an
opportunity
to
--
to
do
something
about
it
and
they
maintained
the
same
reapportionment
that
they
have,
what
position
would
you
say
the
district
court
would
it
be
in
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
ahead,
colonel.
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
the
last
reapportionment
in
--
in
delaware
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
prior
to
the
--
prior
to
the
1962
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
last
reapportionment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.

chief

is
that
the
situation
at

that
the
court
below
told
them
to
--
to
act
by
a
certain
day?
chief

(inaudible)
adjourned
a

come

chief

mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
their
any
reason
assigned
--
assigned,
general,
to
the
fact
that
in
new
castle
county
and
the
senate,
one
--
one
district
should
have
4000
and
another
52,
does
the
legislature
make
any
explanation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
the
same
in
the
house?
chief
justice
earl
warren
colonel
wiener.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
colonel,
you
--
you
ask
us
to
sustain
the
1963
method
of
apportionment
and
may
i
ask
you
on
what
basis
the
legislature
in
new
castle
county
outside
of
wilmington
had
one
district
with
1643
people
in
it
and
another
one
20,000
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
this
--
that
the
plan
the
same
in
all
the
district
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
15
as
against
18.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
counsel
to
say
that
they
were
not
up
against
any
--
any
necessity
for
adjournment
that
they
--
that
they
could
adjourn
for
a
few
days
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
recess
for
a
few
days
and
comeback
and
that
they
have
been
doing
it
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
was
the
latest
date
that
--
that
they
could've
given
notice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
when
was
the
--
when
was
the
legislature
adjourned
actually
in
this
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
adjourned.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
--
when
did
--
when
did
they
act
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
30th
of
july.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
got
your
point.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
