justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
say
both
houses
--
the
question
of
both
houses
is
before
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
which
house
is
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
--
if
i
understand
the
other
side
correctly,
they
say
there's
perhaps
one
house
maybe
handled
one
way
and
one
another
and
consequently,
if
--
if
you
accepted
that
view,
there's
some
essential
relationship
with
the
other
house
to
--
it
seems
to
me
it's
very
difficult
to
deal
with
one
house
without
dealing
with
the
other.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
i
believe
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
of
course,
your
--
your
opponent
doesn't
agree
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
accepting
that
will
be
--
accepting
that
view
then
you
may
deal
just
for
one
house
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
take
another
approach,
it
would
seem
to
me
you'll
have
to
deal
with
two
houses.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
colonel
--
justice
byron
r.
white
colonel
wiener,
i
take
it
then
that
--
that
if
the
district
court
hadn't
acted,
there
would
have
been
--
certainly
it
was
introduced
in
the
house
an
issue
to
base
the
house
on
population?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
made
you
pass
the
senate,
to
base
the
senate
on
population?
justice
byron
r.
white
within
the
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see
and
the
house
bill
was
just
introduced?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
to
what
--
under
the
senate
--
under
the
bill
for
the
reapportionment
of
the
senate,
what
would
have
been
necessities
that
could
have
controlled
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
percentage
of
population
i'm
certainly
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
23%
elects
two-thirds
of
the
senate
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
understand
that.
