mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
decision
of
the
statutory
court
below,
consisting
as
this
court
knows,
of
judge
biggs,
judge
wright
and
judge
layton,
declaring
the
apportionment
provisions
of
the
delaware
constitution
inviolate
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
subsequent
injunction
which
restrained
the
defendants,
appellants
below
from
conducting
any
elections
for
the
membership
of
the
general
assembly
was,
in
our
opinion,
clearly
correct
in
both
instances
and
we
ask
that
the
opinion
below
be
affirmed.
now,
because
my
friend,
mr.
wiener,
suggests
that
there
are
maybe
some
novelty
present
in
the
delaware
litigation
that
was
not
argued
heretofore
in
the
other
reapportionment
cases
that
your
--
the
bench
heard
during
the
week
of
november
12th
of
this
year,
we
think
it
might
be
appropriate
to
define
more
precisely
the
issues
that
were
presented
to
the
court
below,
the
issues
therefore
they
are
before
you,
and
are
set
forth,
if
i
may,
a
more
clear
exposition
of
the
grounds
upon
which
that
decision
below
rests.
as
a
prologue
to
my
argument,
permit
me
to
agree
in
principle
with
colonel
wiener
that
delaware,
perhaps,
in
some
ways,
is
very
unique.
it
was,
as
your
honors
know,
the
first
case
--
the
first
state
rather
to
ratify
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
an
event
which
we
celebrate
in
our
state
each
december
7th
of
each
year.
one
of
the
13
original
colonies,
it
ranks
second
smallest
in
area
of
the
50
states.
it
is
smaller
in
this
regard
as
this
court
heard
than
saint
lawrence
county
in
new
york
state.
it
is
smaller,
of
course,
than
many
counties
throughout
this
nation.
it
is
48th
of
the
50
states
in
population
in
--
and
that
is,
it
ranks
48th
in
numbers.
its
northern
border
is
about
94
miles
away
from
its
southern
border.
at
its
widest
point,
it
is
about
35
miles
in
width
that
is
on
the
southern
end
of
the
state.
on
the
upper
end,
it
is
about
an
arc
of
8
miles
drawn
from
new
castle
county's
courthouse.
its
highest
point,
your
honors
please,
is
about
440
feet
above
sea
--
sea
level.
it
contains
no
dormitory
counties,
such
as
you
have
heard
exist
in
maryland
or
in
connecticut
or
in
new
york.
it
has
no
large
military
concentrations
within
its
borders
such
as
virginia.
it
has
no
offshore
islands
such
as
rhode
island
or
massachusetts,
nor
does
it
have
any
widely
separated
regions
such
as
--
are
to
be
found
in
the
upper
peninsula
of
michigan.
delaware
is
uniquely
compact
and
uniquely
accessible
from
one
end
of
the
state
to
the
other.
our
capital
is,
as
you
know,
in
dover
and
dover
is
situate
about
50
miles
from
wilmington.
it
is
within
easy
accessible
driving
range,
within
one
hour
from
any
portion
of
our
state.
our
legislators
who
meet
in
the
general
assembly,
a
number
of
whom
are
here
today
to
hear
these
arguments,
commute
daily
back
and
forth
from
their
homes
to
dover
into
the
general
assembly.
so
we
have
none
of
the
other
problems
as
we
see
it
that
might
affect
your
decision
in
other
cases.
ours
is
uniquely
our
case
and
we
would
like
to
confine
our
unique
case
for
your
consideration
to
the
following
facts.
the
delaware
general
assembly
is
a
bicameral
body.
it
consists,
of
course,
of
a
senate,
an
upper
house
and
a
house
of
representatives.
the
composition
of
both
of
these
houses
was
fixed
by
the
convention
of
1896
and
became
effective
in
1897.
we
have
not
had
reapportionment
prior
to
the
institution
of
this
suit
since
1897
and
before
that
we
had
no
apportionment
in
our
state
--
reapportionment
from
the
period
of
1831
to
1897.
now
then,
in
1897,
the
convention
contrived
of
a
house
of
representatives
consisting
not
of
county
representation,
if
you
please,
but
it
created
geographical
representative
districts.
it
created
35
of
those
districts.
now,
it
happens
that
10
of
the
representative
districts
are
to
be
found
and
were
allotted
to
the
rural
areas
of
our
three
counties
and
as
mr.
wiener
has
stated,
we
have
but
three
counties
in
delaware.
the
five
remaining
of
the
35
representative
districts
were
allotted
to
the
city
of
wilmington.
in
the
senate,
it
created
again
17
representative
geographical
rather
senatorial
geographical
districts.
and
those
17
geographical
distri
--
districts
were
again
so
constituted
that
geographically,
five
or
in
each
of
the
rural
areas
of
the
three
counties
and
two
were
to
be
found
within
the
city
of
wilmington.
now,
as
i
stated
we've
had
no
reapportionment
prior
to
the
institution
of
suit
and
the
constitution
of
1897
provided
for
no
periodic
reapportionment
of
our
general
assembly.
we
have
neither
initiative
nor
referendum
in
our
constitution.
when
the
constitution
was
adopted
in
the
state
of
delaware
in
1897,
the
population
of
our
state
was
approximately
180,000
inhabitants.
105
of
those
persons
resided
in
the
city
--
resided
rather
in
new
castle
county.
70,000
of
them
resided
in
the
city
of
wilmington
and
35,000
in
the
rural
areas
outside
of
wilmington.
at
that
time,
35,000
persons
inhabited
the
rural
areas
of
kent
county
and
38,000
resided
in
the
rural
areas
of
sussex
county.
now,
when
the
constitution
was
adopted,
as
will
appear
by
the
debates
of
the
constitutional
convention
of
1896,
the
people
who
lived
in
the
rural
areas
of
our
state
were
considered
to
be
identical
not
only
in
their
vocations
but
in
their
interest
and
consequently,
i
believe
it
made
logical
sense
to
allot
to
them
equality
since
their
representation,
the
number
of
persons
who
lived
in
the
rural
areas
were
substantially
identical.
however,
wilmington,
with
a
population
of
70,000,
was
given
different
considerations.
instead
of
allotting
representation
to
wilmington
on
a
population
basis,
it
was
given
a
sop
of
two
senatorial
representatives
and
five
additional
representatives
in
the
house.
now,
what
happened
in
delaware
is,
i
suppose,
what
has
happened
in
a
great
number
of
other
states.
we
have
had
a
tremendous
population
explosion
in
our
state.
it
was
not
conceivable,
i'm
sure
in
1897
for
our
legislators
to
have
known
or
to
have
anticipated
the
direction
in
which
this
population
explosion
might
have
occurred.
we
did
not
know
that
by
1960,
our
sate
would've
reached
446,000
in
inhabitants.
we
did
not
know,
of
course,
that
by
1960,
307,000
of
446,000
would
be
residing
in
new
castle
county.
we
didn't
know
what
would
happen
in
the
suburbs
of
wilmington
and
what
has
happened
since
19
--
1896
is
that
that
population
has
increased
now
to
211,000
persons
from
which
we
now
still
get
the
same
representation
of
five
members
in
the
house
--
rather
10
members
in
the
house
and
five
in
the
senate.
in
the
same
period
of
time,
new
castle
county
or
rather
kent
county
has
grown
to
65,000
and
sussex
county
about
75
--
73,000.
thus,
by
1960,
69%
of
our
entire
state
population
resides
in
new
castle
county,
14%,
approximately,
reside
in
kent
and
approximately
16%
in
sussex
county.
because
of
this
irregular
population
explosion,
and
the
fact
that
all
attempts
prior
to
1962
to
reapportion
the
state
legislature
had
failed,
and
i
might
point
out
to
your
honors
that
in
the
six
years
that
preceded,
the
institution
of
this
suit,
there
had
been
seven
attempts
made
in
the
general
assembly
of
our
state
to
achieve
some
kind
of
reapportionment
in
the
general
assembly.
of
the
seven
bills
that
were
presented,
one
reached
the
floor
and
was
promptly
voted
down.
the
other
six
never
came
out
of
committee.
so
that
in
1960,
with
this
irregular
population
explosion
and
the
districts
frozen
in,
the
representative
districts
ranged
in
size
from
about
1643
inhabitants
in
the
new
castle
county
15th
representative
district
to
over
58,000
in
new
castle
county's
6th
district.
this,
gentlemen,
is
a
disparity
of
over
35-to-1.
similar
disparities
are
to
be
found
between
the
districts
not
only
in
new
castle
county,
not
only
in
kent
county,
not
only
in
sussex
county
but
also,
of
course,
in
the
city
of
wilmington.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
no,
sir,
it
does
not.
it
lies
outside
of
the
city
as
known
as
brandy
100.
in
the
--
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir,
i
believe
so.
you
will
find
that
in
delaware,
in
the
house
of
representatives
generally
in
the
1896
convention,
drew
the
districts,
representative
districts
to
be
--
to
follow
the
old
ancient
boundaries
of
hundreds.
you'll
find
that
in
the
senate,
there
are
combinations
of
hundreds
and
other
representative
districts,
but
in
general,
they
do
follow
them.
now,
in
kent
county,
we
had
--
well,
in
wilmington,
for
example,
we
had
one
district,
the
4th
district
that
has
5300
in
population
and
right
next
to
it
in
the
5th
district,
there
are
over
30,000
inhabitants
living
there.
similarly,
in
the
city
of
wilmington,
another
district
has
33,000
as
compared
with
the
5300
in
the
4th
district.
in
kent
county,
they
had
one
district
that
has
17,800
in
it.
in
the
second
district
and
right
next
to
it,
in
the
3rd
district,
there
are
about
3300.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
not
at
all,
sir.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
in
--
in
the
city
of
wilmington,
sir?
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir.
well,
i
have
read
the
--
i've
read
the
debates
of
the
convention
of
1896
and
there
are
three
very
large
volumes
and
i
cannot
find
anywhere
in
the
committee
on
the
legislature
any
explanation
ever
offered
for
the
creation
of
these
districts.
as
you
read
those
debates,
you'll
find
that
there
were
four
reports
of
the
committee
on
legislation.
they
apparently
wrestled
with
the
problem
of
numbers
first.
that
is
how
many
representatives
was
each
county
going
to
get,
how
many
was
wilmington
going
to
get?
there
were
three
different
plans
suggested
that
dealt
with
wilmington.
they
finally
settled
on
wilmington
getting
five
additional
representatives
and
two
senators.
they
then
reassigned
this
task
of
districting
to
the
committee
and
the
committee
came
back
with
a
report
which
was
adopted.
there's
no
explanation
as
to
how
they
arrived
at
the
districting.
no
--
no
basis
that
i
can
find
that
they
considered
the
population
whatsoever.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
you
mean
in
physical
areas,
chief
justice?
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
or
you
mean
--
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
chief
justice
warren,
i
would
say
that
delaware
is
unique
for
one
other
matter
and
that
is
the
quality
of
the
people
that
you
find
from
one
end
of
the
state
to
the
other
cannot
be
divided
or
separated
or
told
apart.
you
just
can't
tell
a
sussex
countian,
in
my
opinion,
from
a
new
castle
resident.
i
don't
think
you
can
tell
a
kent
countian
from
a
sussex
countian.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
in
the
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
there
is
nothing
of
that
sort
whatsoever.
it
is
true
that
the
city
of
wilmington
maybe
considered
to
be
more
industrial
than
the
county
suburbs
or
suburban
areas
around
it.
the
6th
district
is
solidly
suburban
and
residential.
but
it
was
interesting,
the
record
will
show
this
that
by
1910,
delaware
had
lost
its
status
as
a
rural
state
according
to
the
census
and
i
think
chief
justice,
the
record
will
show
that
it's
becoming
more
and
more
industrialized
through
out
the
state.
the
indu
--
industry
is
not
confined
to
new
castle
any
longer.
it's
to
be
found
in
kent
and
sussex,
both.
now,
i
might
add
that
in
the
1963
amendment
that
you
asked
me
about,
there
was
no
effort
made,
for
example,
in
dividing
the
or
in
providing
for
additional
representation,
no
effort
was
made
to
combine
any
of
the
small
districts.
for
example,
the
15th
district
of
new
castle
county
which
is
the
smallest
one
with
1643
inhabitants,
was
left
that
way
even
though
since
1890,
that
hundred
has
increased
about
143
inhabitants
in
that
entire
time.
it
remained
with
one
house
representative.
what
they
did
was
to
take
the
larger
areas
such
as
brandy
100
and
subdivide
that
according
to
a
15,000
population
or
a
major
fraction
thereof,
but
they
left
the
smaller
ones
completely
intact.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
oh!
i
think
that's
absolutely
explicit
if
not
implicit.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
if
you
would
--
the
record
shows
and
we
have
it
in
our
appendix
that
mr.
wilson,
who
was
admitted
here
today,
a
fine
lawyer
in
wilmington,
was
chairman
of
the
committee,
the
governor's
bipartisan
committee,
stated
in
the
trial
of
this
cause
that
the
reason
they
didn't
change
the
provisions
of
article
ii,
section
2
of
1897
as
far
as
it
relates
to
future
constitutional
conventions
was
because
they
didn't
want
the
reapportionment
to
apply
to
that
convention.
it's
obvious
that
this
is
a
question
of
under
representation
or
being
bucked
by
the
overrepresented
areas.
if
i
may
continue,
i
was
reciting
the
situation
that
existed
in
1960
insofar
as
the
house
was
concerned.
in
1960,
as
we
have
stated,
18.5%
of
the
population
of
the
state
of
delaware
was
able
to
elect
a
majority
in
the
house
of
representatives.
in
the
senate,
a
similar
situation
existed.
the
seven
geographical
senatorial
districts
that
lie
within
new
castle
county
represented
a
total
population
of
over
307,000
while
the
five
in
sussex
county
represented
about
73,000
and
those
five
in
kent,
65,000.
the
senatorial
districts
in
1962
ranged
from
65,000
to
4000
so
that
a
vote
in
the
smallest
senatorial
district
in
delaware
was
worth
almost
16
times
the
vote
in
the
largest.
22%
of
our
entire
population
elected
the
majority
in
the
senate.
and
this,
if
your
honors
will
recall,
prompted
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
to
say
that
delaware
represented
the
worst
represented
general
assembly
of
any
of
the
50,
third
worst,
sorry.
now,
these
disparities
that
i
have
spoken
off
existed
not
only
on
an
inter-county
basis,
they're
also
on
an
intra-county
basis
and
they
are
to
be
found,
as
i
pointed
out,
within
the
city
of
wilmington.
my
friend
would
state
that
the
basis
of
discriminatory,
the
utmost
of
discrimination
in
this
field
would
be
a
crazy
quilt
type
of
apportionment.
i
don't
think
that
you
can
find
a
better
example
of
a
crazy
quilt
apportionment
than
you
can
in
the
delaware
situation.
often,
the
discriminations
exist,
as
i
pointed
out,
in
adjoining
districts.
sometimes,
the
difference
is
simply
the
question
of
whether
you
live
on
one
side
of
a
street
or
on
the
other
side
of
a
street.
sometimes,
it's
a
question
of
whether
you
live
on
this
side
of
a
creek
or
on
the
other
side
of
a
creek,
even
though
the
persons
on
both
sides
of
the
street
are
identical
and
on
both
sides
of
the
street
are
identical.
now,
we
have
heard
today
about
the
amendment
of
1963.
this
was
instituted
in
the
1962
legislature
and
finally
consummated
in
1963
and
we
refer
to
it
as
the
1963
amendment.
and
we
think
the
effect
of
that
represent
--
of
that
amendment
was
to
freeze
into
the
senatorial
districts
representation
of
new
castle
county,
the
seven
existing
districts
and
the
effect
of
adding
two
additional
floterial
or
at
large
senators
in
both
kent
and
sussex
and
where
the
total
membership
of
the
senate
was
increased
from
17
to
21
and
by
adding
the
four
floterial
senators
to
areas
having
about
31%
of
the
population
at
the
expense
of
the
areas
containing
69%
of
the
population
and
it's
interesting
to
know
that
when
questioned,
the
chairman
of
the
bipartisan
committee
that
prepared
this
bill,
stated
that
when
they
allotted
the
four
additional
senators
to
the
two
lower
county
areas,
they
did
not
take
into
account
population
at
all.
now,
in
the
house,
they
divide
the
house
into
10
additional
districts
by
dividing
the
more
populous
districts
on
the
basis
of
15,000
populations.
the
smaller
districts,
even
in
the
same
county,
were
left
untouched.
the
amendment,
as
i
have
pointed
out,
also
froze
into
future
constitutional
conventions,
the
composition
of
the
general
assembly
as
it
existed
in
1897.
and
so
the
effect
of
the
amendment,
if
i
may
summarize
it,
was
that
in
kent
and
sussex
counties,
in
the
house,
it
had
no
effect
and
it
perpetuated
discrepancies
that
existed
of
over
ten-and-half
to
one
in
kent
and
over
eleven-and-half
to
one
in
sussex.
in
new
castle
county
even
after
the
subdivision
and
the
creation
of
10
additional
districts,
we
still
have
discrepancies
as
high
as
12-to-1.
we
still
have
numerous
discrepancies
of
11-to-1
and
many
at
10-to-1
and
under
the
amendment,
instead
of
the
18.5%
of
the
population
that
prior
to
the
--
could
elect
the
majority,
it
now
is
about
28%
of
the
population
of
our
state
that
can
elect
the
majority
in
the
house.
after
the
amendment,
the
disparities
in
population
in
new
castle
ranged
from
4100
to
64,000
or
over
15-to-1
in
new
castle.
in
kent,
they
range
from
7000
to
46,000
or
six-and-half
to
one,
in
sussex,
from
9000
to
38,000
or
over
four-and-half
to
one.
after
the
amendment,
kent,
with
a
population
of
about
14.5%,
now
elects
one-third
of
our
senate.
each
voter
in
kent
county
now
elects
two-twenty-first
of
our
senate.
the
same
thing
is
true
in
sussex
county
with
about
16.5%
of
the
population,
but
after
the
amendment,
new
castle
with
69%
is
still
permitted
to
elect
about
one-third
of
the
senate
and
our
residents
in
our
county
in
our
senatorial
districts
can
vote
for
about
one
twenty-first
of
the
senate.
now,
it
was
obviously
in
the
light
of
these
facts
and
many
others
that
were
developed
during
the
trial
in
the
district
court
below
that
the
opinion
of
april
17th
which
held
article
ii,
section
2
as
existed
both
before
and
after
the
amendment
to
be
unconstitutional
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
should
be
viewed.
the
court
below
said
that
these
disparities
resulted
in
gross
and
invidious
discrimination
against
the
plaintiffs
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
court
could
find
no
rational
or
reasonable
basis
for
the
apportionment.
contrary
to
what
has
been
said
here,
it
--
i
think
throughout
the
entire
course
of
the
litigation
considered
that
basically,
the
problem
of
reapportionment
was
a
matter
for
the
general
assembly
of
the
state
to
properly
apportion
itself
in
accordance
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
this
regard,
honoring
the
request
of
counsel
for
the
defendants
below,
the
court
laid
down
certain
guidelines,
standards
that
in
the
apportionment
of
the
house
of
representatives
of
delaware,
the
basis
must
be
one
of
population.
it
adopted
this
court's
ruling
in
sander
gray
--
sanders
versus
gray
and
announced
that
one
vote,
one
person
must
be
the
aim
and
that
in
the
senate,
while
population
must
be
given
the
heaviest
vote,
other
factors
such
as
diverse
interests,
county
governmental
functions,
geography,
area,
historic
and
economic
differences
might
be
considered
provided
that
no
wide
deviation
from
the
principle
of
population
representation
would
be
permitted
and
then,
only
if
the
deviation
served
a
valid
legislative
purpose.
in
reaching
that
conclusion,
the
court
applied
the
guarantees
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
in
this
regard,
i
believe
it
is
explicitly
supported
and
sustained
by
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
baker
versus
carr
whereas
as
we
see
it,
baker
stated
a
rule
that
was
more
than
procedural.
baker
stated
the
rule
that
gross
dilutions
of
voting
rights
which
result
from
unlawful
discriminations
against
people
lead
to
limitations
that
exceed
the
constitutionality.
and
that
this
conclusion
of
the
court
in
baker
versus
carr
is
correct,
we
believe
is
supported
by
the
overwhelming
number
of
federal,
lower
federal
and
state
courts,
which
have
followed
that
rule
since
the
ruling
of
baker
versus
carr.
we
think
also
that
the
court
below
was
following
the
mandate
contained
in
the
closing
words
of
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
that
case
where
he
said,
"the
complaint's
allegations
of
a
denial
of
equal
protection
presents
a
justiciable
constitutional
cause
of
action
upon
which
the
plaintiffs
were
entitled
to
a
trial
and
a
decision.
"
now,
in
reaching
the
conclusion
below,
it
is
our
feeling
that
the
court
followed
what
it
considered
to
be
and
what
are
traditionally
considered
to
be
the
well-established
concepts
and
tests
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
found
that
the
discriminations,
inequalities
that
existed
reflected
no
policy
and
were
simply
arbitrary
and
capricious.
the
court,
as
i
have
stated,
adopted
the
principle
of
representation
or
the
principle
or
the
equality
and
majority
rule,
the
concept
that
one
person
and
one
vote
must
be
applied
according
to
the
court
below
to
both
houses
of
the
general
assembly.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
chief
justice,
we
believe
that
there
could
be
little
doubt,
the
case
was
decided
on
the
question
of
the
house
and
could
have
been
left
on
the
question
of
the
house
alone.
the
court
below
unanimously
found
that
there
were
no
separability
provisions
in
our
constitution.
it,
therefore,
found
that
the
invidious
discrimination
that
existed
in
the
house
was
sufficient,
but
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
if
your
honor
please,
there
was
a
very
extensive
pretrial
had
in
this
case
and
in
the
course
of
that
pretrial,
the
plaintiffs
below
wanted
to
go
further.
they
felt
that
one
of
the
issues
in
the
case
that
remained
was,
what
kind
of
a
plan
of
apportionment,
if
any,
should
be
adopted
by
the
court.
we
certainly
felt
that
we
were
litigating
the
question
of
what
kind
of
a
plan
would
be
acceptable.
we,
therefore,
presented
our
own
plan
which
included
both
houses.
in
the
course
of
the
trial
as
has
been
stated
by
colonel
wiener,
the
court
did
hand
counsel
a
former
plan
for
the
house
alone
and
asked
our
comment
on
that,
but
we
had
hoped
that
we
would
get
across-the-board
relief
because
we
don't
think
relief
in
one
house
is
substantial
relief
in
delaware.
but
i
think
technically,
i
must
say
to
your
honor,
that
the
court
could
have
decided
the
matter
only
on
the
house
and
i
think
it
did,
but
the
court
went
on
because
counsel,
in
the
course
of
trial,
had
requested
guidelines
be
established.
the
court
then
went
on
and
in
judge
biggs'
words,
used
precatory,
precatory
advice,
gave
precatory
advice
to
the
general
assembly
as
to
what
that
court
considered
would
be
the
minimum
plan
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
mr.
justice
goldberg,
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
three
more
distinguished
judges
than
the
three
we
had.
they
are
all
delawarians
and
as
old
as
we
can
find
in
delaware
and
as
the
footnote
of
colonel
wiener
has
documented,
judge
biggs
--
judge
biggs'
father
was
the
president
of
the
convention
of
1897.
his
grandfather
participated
in
the
convention
of
1852.
judge
layton
is
as
old
as
sussex
county
and
so
is
judge
wright.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
never.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
i
think
that's
correct.
until
the
--
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
well,
sir,
in
that
case,
the
convention
adopted
a
constitution
but
it
was
subject
to
approval
of
the
people
and
the
people
of
delaware
defeated
that
constitution
at
the
polls
and
it
was
precisely
over
this
very
issue
of
representation
by
population
that
defeated
it
in
1852.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
that
is
absolutely
correct.
there
was
a
claim
made
in
the
--
in
the
convention
of
1896
that
delaware
should
adopt
the
federal
analogy
and
we
have
quoted
at
page
10,
i
believe,
9
and
10
of
our
motion
–
brief
in
support
of
our
motion
to
affirm
below
a
few
excerpts
from
the
debates
that
took
place.
i
read
from
mr.
nathan
pratt,
"i
do
not
regard
a
county
as
i
do
a
state.
i
cannot
understand
on
what
ground
such
a
comparison
can
be
made.
"
and
william
salisbury
said,
"in
the
state
of
delaware,
we
have
no
such
conditions.
a
county
is
not
an
independent
sovereignty.
the
counties
of
new
castle,
kent
and
sussex
were
never
free
and
independent
states
of
themselves.
"
now,
this
federal
analogy
was
rejected
completely
in
the
convention
of
1896
and
why
it
should
be
resurrected
in
1963
is
something
beyond
me,
i
can't
understand
it.
i
come
to
this
question
of
county
sovereignty.
we
think
that
the
claim
that
delaware
should
be
in
the
classification
of
federal
analogy
is
erroneous.
first,
we
can
find
no
comparable
incidence
of
history
in
delaware
which
are
analogous
to
the
situation
that
necessitated
that
compromised
in
the
federal
system.
we
never
had
such
a
historic
event
as
we
had
in
the
connecticut
compromise.
secondly,
the
counties
of
delaware
were
never
sovereign
and
i
don't
believe
that
any
of
the
witnesses
in
the
trial
of
this
court
so
stated,
but
if
they
were,
it
would
be
our
position
that
such
fact
would
be
irrelevant
to
any
of
the
issues
before
this
court.
we
are
concerned
here
not
with
county
discriminations.
we
are
concerned
here
with
the
action
of
the
state
of
delaware
in
denying
these
plaintiffs
equal
protection.
i
know
of
no
charge
that
any
county
is
involved
in
these
discriminations
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
delaware,
counties
have
--
they're
integral
part
of
our
state
but
they
form
no
governmental
function.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
unquestionably.
the
state
had
existed
under
colonel
wiener's
argument
from
september
of
1776
until
the
date
of
the
1868
period
and
it
had
existed
without
federal
analogy.
of
course,
another
comment
on
that
is
that
the
delaware
house
of
representatives
is,
of
course,
not
apportioned
strictly
on
population
while
the
federal
house,
we
believe
is
so
apportioned.
and
in
delaware,
as
we
pointed
out,
18.5%
or
28%
whichever
--
you
are
considering
the
old
constitution
or
the
amendment
of
the
population
can
now
elect
the
majority
in
the
house.
while,
as
we
show
in
our
brief,
it
takes
approximately
50%
of
the
population
of
the
states
to
constitute
a
majority
in
the
united
states
house
of
representatives.
and
lastly,
the
federal
analogy
is
not
applicable
to
delaware
because
our
senators
are
not
chosen
from
the
counties.
they're
chosen
from
representative
districts
that
happen
to
be
situated
in
the
counties
and
the
discrimination
that
exist
is
not
a
county
vis-à-vis
county,
it's
a
representative
district
or
a
senatorial
district
vis-à-vis
one
another.
so
that
we
don't
think
that
mr.
wiener's
argument
on
the
federal
analogy
should
be
applied
to
the
delaware
legislature.
now,
the
next
argument
that
mr.
wiener
has
asserted,
as
we
understand
it,
is
that
of
contemporaneous
construction.
we
pointed
out
at
the
beginning
that
this
has
nothing
to
do
whatsoever
with
the
rationale
of
the
disparities
existing
in
the
general
assembly
of
the
state
of
delaware.
it
is
an
argument,
we
believe,
that
was
made
first
had
its
genesis
in
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
brown
versus
topeka.
it
was
--
i'm
sorry,
baker
versus
carr.
it
was
started
in
brown
versus
topeka.
it
was
repeated
with
special
application
by
mr.
justice
frank
--
frankfurter
in
the
dissent
in
baker
versus
carr
and
there
rejected
and
as
i
understand
it,
it
has
been
reintroduced
into
the
reapportionment
suit
--
arguments
in
the
maryland
case.
now,
in
the
brown
case,
it
was
rejected
as
being
incon
--
inconclusive
in
the
field
of
public
education.
it
was
not
accepted
by
this
court
in
baker.
in
the
brown
case,
this
court
refused
to
turn
the
clock
back
to
1868
and
considered
public
education
in
the
light
of
a
full
development
and
present
place
in
american
life
throughout
the
nation.
no
other
apportion,
we
believe,
of
the
constitution
with
the
exception
perhaps,
of
the
commerce
clause,
has
had
so
much
elasticity
as
the
due
process,
public,
equal
protection
clause,
but
we're
not
here,
it
seems
to
us,
to
argue
the
abstract
questions,
which
mr.
wiener
presents
of
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
might
have
meant
in
1868
in
the
field
of
apportionment.
if
we
are
here,
it
seems
to
us,
to
argue
the
question
of
whether
the
equal
protection
clause
means
today
what
you
said
it
meant,
as
we
interpret
it,
in
baker
v.
--
versus
carr.
we
are
here
today
to
argue
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
means
to
the
apportionment
of
the
delaware
general
assembly.
now,
we
don't
think
that
mr.
wiener's
contemporaneous
construction
helps
us
very
much
in
arriving
today
at
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
means
in
the
field
of
apportionment
of
general
assemblies.
moreover,
we
think
that
it's
apparent
from
the
discussion
that
we've
heard
this
morning
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
not
particularly
designed
to
meet
the
challenge
or
the
problem
of
the
apportionment
of
state
legislatures.
we
think
that
a
careful
reading
of
the
cases
of
this
court
indicates
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
chiefly
concerned
with
the
then
current
problem
of
protecting
the
rights
of
negroes.
apportionment
of
state
legislatures
was
not
then
a
current
problem
and
under
the
standards
of
equality
of
the
times
was
like
separate
facilities
being
in
advance
over
no
facilities
and
improvement
over
that
which
antedated
it.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
i'm
not
familiar
with
that,
i'm
sorry
to
say.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
i'm
sorry
i'm
not
familiar
with
it.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
well,
it
may
have
been
concerned
with
voting
and
i
think
it
was.
i
think
it
was
designed
to
mean
this,
that
insofar
as
suffrage
then
existed,
insofar
as
classifications
then
existed,
the
equal
protection
clause
operated
to
help
and
to
protect
those
persons
who
then
existed
in
those
particular
roots
of
suffrage.
i
don't
think
it
was
meant
to
take
away
from
the
states
but
--
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
well,
i
think
that
if
it
was
designed
to
meet,
it
was
designed
to
apply
solely
to
voting,
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
think
there
would've
been
any
real
need
for
the
fifteenth
amendment.
i
don't
think
that
there
would
have
been
any
need
for
the
nineteenth
amendment.
i
don't
think
that
the
--
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
that
again
--
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
--
i
think
that
is
the
explanation
as
to
how
it
was
to
apply
the
apportionment
but
i
don't
think
it
was
applying
to
apportionment
as
in
the
general
assembly
generally,
although
i
do
admit
that
it
had
no
limitations.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
i
think
it
perhaps
does,
but
i
would
think
that
today
there
are
many
cases
that
were
tried
and
days
gone
by
when
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
set
--
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
--
not
to
extend
the
protection
that
i
think
today
probably
would
have
reached
different
result.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes
sir.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir.
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
that's
why
we've
had
the
general
expansion
and
development
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
well,
the
application
of
it.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir.
i
think
in
the
field
of
public
education
for
example,
we
had
problems,
we
had
separate
facilities
then
and
i
don't
suppose
before
brown
versus
topeka,
the
courts
would
have
applied
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
equal
protection
to
that
situation,
but
they
had
expanded
it
and
they
did
in
brown
versus
topeka.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
no,
sir.
may
i
continue?
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
so
our
conclusion
on
the
question
of
contempora
--
contemporaneous
construction
is
that
at
this
time,
it
is
not
of
any
great
material
help
to
this
court.
we
think
it
--
at
best
it
is
inconclusive
and
speculative
and
there
we
leave
it.
now,
what
happened
below
was,
of
course,
that
the
court
having
found
the
provisions
invalid
was
faced
with
an
appropriate
type
of
relief
to
be
granted
to
the
plaintiffs.
my
friend
has
alluded
to
the
injunction
that
was
entered
and
perhaps,
i
should
state
the
frame
in
which
--
frame
of
time
in
which
that
injunction
was
issued.
this
suit
was
instituted
on
june
5th,
1962.
in
early
july,
as
colonel
wiener
has
stated,
of
1962,
the
governor
appointed
a
bipartisan
reapportionment
committee.
they
met.
they
had
three
sessions
prior
to
july
25th,
1962.
one
of
the
members
at
least
to
that
committee
was
one
of
the
attorneys
representing
the
defendants
below.
appellants
in
this
court.
it
was
represented
to
the
court
below
that
a
plan
had
been
devised
for
the
reapportionment
of
the
state
of
delaware.
an
application
was
made
prior
to
july
25th
by
the
appellants
below
to
stay
the
action
of
the
court
until
that
plan
could
be
presented
to
the
general
assembly.
the
court
did
grant
the
stay
to
the
--
in
the
proceedings
until
august
7th,
and
it
did
so
because
of
the
representation
that
this
plan
was
ready
and
would
be
presented
to
the
court
below.
now,
my
friend
would
make
haste
out
of
this.
i
say
to
you
that
he
was
not
present
below
and
i
think
might
have
misjudged
a
little
bit
of
the
tempo
of
the
trial,
the
speed
of
the
trial
and
the
necessity
of
the
moment.
judge
biggs,
with
all
of
his
many,
many
years
on
the
bench,
stated
on
at
least
three
occasions
as
an
indication
of
his
concern
with
the
importance
of
this
case
that
it
was
the
--
the
most
important
case
that
he
had
sat
on
in
the
25
years
that
he
had
sat
on
the
federal
bench.
i
can
assure
you
gentlemen,
if
assurance
need
be
given,
that
the
question
of
haste,
pressure
and
so
forth
that
is
alleged
to
have
been
attributed
to
judge
biggs
just
did
not
exist.
he
granted
the
stay
until
august
7th
and
there
was
good
reason
for
granting
the
stay
until
august
7th
because
if
the
plan
was
to
be
adopted,
an
amendment
to
the
constitution,
it
would
require
publication.
the
publication
had
to
be
made
before
the
4th
or
5th
of
august.
and
therefore,
if
the
plan
was
not
going
to
be
passed
by
the
--
by
the
general
assembly,
there
was
no
reason
to
stay
the
proceedings
any
longer.
i
might
point
out
that
in
the
--
in
the
first
opinion
of
judge
biggs,
he
suggested
to
the
general
assembly
that
they
consider
the
question
of
passing
a
statute
providing
that
apportionment
in
the
general
assembly
of
this
state
shall
be
by
statute,
not
as
a
permanent
harbor
but
as
a
temporary
haven.
this,
of
course,
was
ignored
by
the
legislature
which
went
ahead
and
passed
the
invalid
amendment.
now,
i
think
the
briefs
are
adequately
replete
with
the
references
which
we
have
made
to
the
timing
of
this
case.
it
was
april
17th,
1963
before
the
court
handed
down
its
final
opinion
on
the
merits
to
this
case.
between
july
25th,
1962
and
april
17th,
1930,
counsels
were
completely
aware
of
what
was
going
on.
the
legislature
was
completely
aware
of
what
was
going
on.
on
april
30th
when
the
opinion
was
handed
down,
the
court,
again,
in
its
over
abundance
of
caution
to
try
to
help
the
general
assembly
assume
its
responsibility
which
it
had
not
assumed
to
reapportion
the
state,
granted
the
legislature
an
additional
time
from
the
date
of
the
decree
which
is
april
30th
until
october
1st
to
pass
an
appropriate
statute
relating
to
reapportionment.
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
has
pointed
out
through
his
questioning,
the
legislature
just
has
--
simply
has
not
taken
any
effective
steps
since
that
date
and
here
it
is,
december
of
1963
and
still
no
steps
have
been
taken.
this,
i
submit,
is
in
line
with
what
the
--
we
have
alleged
in
our
brief.
we
have
stated
the
numerous
occasions
on
which
we
have
attempted
to
get
a
reapportionment
in
the
state
of
delaware.
we
have
met
with
legislatives
still
made
on
this
question
and
unless
this
court
will
lay
down
the
minimum
standards
or
will
affirm
below,
i
don't
think
we're
going
to
get
--
let
any
reapportionment
in
delaware
for
good
number
of
years
to
come.

believe
it's
in

that

it

mr.

sir.
yes
sir,
that's
right.
mr.

yes.
mr.

no.
we
have
--

i'm

i'm
very
sorry.

call

in

mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
on
this
question
of
relief,
i
think
it
should
be
clear
that
the
plaintiffs
had
asked
the
court
below
to
accept
the
plan
or
to
adopt
the
plan
along
the
lines
of
what
the
plaintiffs
had
suggested.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
well,
they're
in
session
now.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
well,
they
had
been,
on
and
off.
they're
on
the
call
of
the
chair
throughout
the
year
and
they
--
they
meet
and
then
they
don't
meet
for
long
periods
of
time
and
--
then
they'll
go
back
for
a
day
or
so
and
they'll
be
off
but
they're
at
the
call
of
the
chair.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
no,
sir.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir,
all
through
the
year.
they
could
do
it
(inaudible)
question.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
no,
this
is
true
in
every
year.
they
meet
year
round.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
it
used
to
be
that
they
would
--
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
yes.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
maybe
be
shorter.
on
occasions,
i
think
it's
been
overnight.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
i
would
say
that
it
would
meet
our
objections
as
far
as
the
house
is
concerned.
it
--
as
i
understand
the
bill,
it
divides
the
state
into
45
districts
and
then
divides
the
number
of
45
into
the
number
of
population
and
then
allots
the
different
districts
according
to
the
number
of
the
popular
quotient.
and
as
i
understand
it
further,
the
bill
permits
an
additional
representative
to
go
to
those
counties
that
have
a
larger
population
after
one
has
been
elected
or
appointed
to
each
district.
now,
as
i
understand
it,
it
will
require
combinations
of
districts.
if
it
doesn't
require
combinations
of
small
districts,
it
would
not
be
satisfactory.
it
was
my
understanding
that
there
would
be
a
reapportionment
committee
that
would
engage
experts
and
so
forth
and
would
meet
and
would
combine
small
districts
throughout
the
state
and
come
up
with
--
with
--
it
doesn't
say
how
many
districts
as
i
read
it,
but
i
think
it
could
be
worked
out.
i'm
not
sure
of
the
--
exactly
of
the
mechanics
but
i
--
it's
a
step
forward,
but
as
far
as
the
senate
is
concern,
no,
no
sir.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
no,
sir.
i
know
of
no
such
statement
by
the
house.
i
believe,
and
this
is
a
speculation,
i
believe
that
there
will
be
no
of
further
attempts
until
this
court
rules.
i
think
that's
the
sum
and
substance
of
it.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
no,
sir.
i
--
i
don't
think
that's
before
you
at
all.
i
think
its
all
be
--
all
is
before
you
is
the
question
whether
you
affirm
or
don't
affirm
the
decision
below.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
1897
and
the
1962
amendment.
they're
both
before
you
and
they
were
both
before
the
court
below.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir,
it
might
be,
i
think.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
no,
sir.
i'm
afraid
it
is
not.
i
wish
it
were
and
if
--
if
i
might
throw
out
my
own
thoughts
on
--
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
well,
the
house
below
--
the
house
that's
here
is
the
house
of
representatives
certainly.
if
it
hadn't
been
for
the
fact
that
the
constitution
was
inseverable,
i
think
we
would
have
had
both
of
them
here.
i
think
--
i
think
that's
where
we
stand.
i
--
i
wish
that
it
were
both,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
i
don't
see
how
you
can
myself.
i
--
i
think
that
the
same
--
the
same
dogma
--
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
--
the
same
principles
apply
in
both
houses.
my
own
feelings
and
i
think
supported
by
--
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
well,
we
would
disagree
on
the
standards
that
you
apply.
we
will
ask
you
to
apply
by
analogy
the
standards
you
adopted
in
sanders
versus
gray
and
we'd
ask
you
to
apply
under
both
houses
because
if
it's
arbitrary
with
respect
to
one
house,
it’s
got
to
be
arbitrary
with
respect
to
the
others.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
there
can
be
a
difference
in
the
second
house
providing,
there's
a
good
legislative
purpose
to
be
served
by
the
disparities.
i
think
there
can
be
permissible
deviations
if
they
serve
a
good
valid
legal
or
rather
governmental
or
legislative
purpose.
and
if
they
do
not
resolve
in
invidious
discrimination
against
the
other
parties
discriminated
against,
they
had
a
very
closed
balance.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
well,
if
--
if
we
were
the
upper
peninsula
of
michigan
situation,
i
think
we
could
deviate
in
the
second
house
and
permit
representation
even
though
population
wouldn't
warrant
it.
mr.
vincent
a.
theisen
yes,
sir,
inaccessibility
which
we
do
not
have
in
delaware.
thank
you.
