mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
must
confess
that
i
found
the
task
of
planning
a
fifth
argument
on
the
subject
of
apportionment
within
a
month
is
somewhat
difficult.
i
concluded
that
it
would
be
most
helpful
if
i
were
to
devote
my
time
today
to
three
aspects
of
this
specific
case.
first,
i
shall
endeavor
to
show
that
this
case
does
not
raise
any
question
about
the
power
of
a
state
to
model
its
legislature
after
the
federal
analogy.
the
case
to
which
appellants'
briefs
are
chiefly
directed
in
our
judgment
simply
isn't
here.
second,
coming
to
the
case
that
is
here
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
that's
because
there
is,
in
our
judgment
for
reason
i'll
state
in
a
moment,
no
resemblance
between
the
apportionment
of
either
house
of
the
delaware
legislature
and
the
apportionment
of
the
seats
in
the
federal
congress.
second,
coming
to
the
case
that
is
here,
i
shall
argue
that
the
apportionment
of
the
delaware
legislature
results
in
gross
discrimination
between
persons,
groups
of
persons
without
any
basis
in
policy
and
is
therefore,
unconstitutional
under
established
principles
of
equal
protection.
and
third,
i
shall
try
to
answer
briefly
some
of
the
appellants'
arguments
directed
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
particularly
its
early
history
and
interpretation
which
i
submit
if
they
have
any
relevance
are
really
abridge
to
reargue
baker
against
carr.
the
appellants
state
on
page
10
of
their
reply
brief
that
the
basic
question
for
decision
is
whether
anything
in
the
equal
protection
clause
forbids
a
state
from
patterning
its
legislature
on
the
federal
model.
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
we
submit
that
this
case
does
not
present
that
question.
the
delaware
legislature
is
unlike
the
congress
of
the
united
states
for
four
--
because
of
four
fundamental
differences.
in
the
first
place,
the
composition
of
the
delaware
senate
is
utterly
unlike
the
composition
of
the
senate
of
the
unites
states.
the
united
states
senators
are
there
to
represent
states.
the
states
are,
for
many
purposes,
sovereign
entities,
each
with
its
own
historical
identity,
each
with
existing
political
function,
a
coherence
of
its
own
and
the
senators
are
chosen
at
large
by
the
peoples
of
the
state
to
represent
them.
now,
assuming
that
counties
are
like
states
and
i
assume
it’s
solely
for
the
purpose
of
argument,
still,
the
delaware
senators
do
not
represent
the
counties.
the
21
senators
are
chosen
by
21
geographical
districts
established
for
the
sole
purpose
of
choosing
senators.
each
senator
is
chosen
by
his
district,
represents
the
district
and
not
the
county.
so
far
as
one
can
see,
the
legislature
might
establish
these
five
counties
instead
of
three
or
abolish
all
counties
and
it
would
have
not
the
slightest
effect
on
the
state
legislature.
that
essential
difference,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
is
reflected
in
the
fact
that
the
delaware
senate
today
is
apportioned
very
like
the
apportionment
under
the
1896
constitution
and
the
districts
are
the
same
except
for
a
few
that
was
added
or
one
can
get
out
it
in
other
way
and
suppose
that
it
were
possible
to
amend
the
constitution
so
as
to
divide
each
state
into
senatorial
districts.
we
would
suppose
that
that
was
a
very
radical
change
in
the
composition
of
our
congress
and
i
think
it
shows
the
radical
difference
between
the
composition
of
the
delaware
senate
and
the
composition
of
the
senate
of
the
united
states.
now,
the
appellants
say,
"well,
this
was
never
suggested
to
us
before."
the
point
is
here,
whether
it
was
suggested
or
not
and
they
say,
"well,
we
didn't
want
to
have
our
senators
chosen
at
large."
well
that's
all
right,
they
may
have
had
very
good
reasons
for
rejecting
the
federal
analogy,
but
their
reasons
for
rejecting
it
cannot
make
something
fundamentally
different
into
the
same
thing
as
the
senate
of
the
united
states.
second,
the
constitution,
the
federal
constitution
contemplates
a
lower
house
apportioned
essentially
in
accordance
with
population.
nothing
in
the
constitution
requires
or
sanctions
gross
inequalities
in
per
capita
representation
in
the
lower
chamber.
seats
in
the
delaware
lower
house
on
the
other
hand
are
not
apportioned
either
among
counties
or
within
counties
on
the
basis
of
population.
to
take
a
single
fact,
kent
county
has
almost
twice
the
per
capita
representation
of
the
people
of
new
castle
county
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
should
have
supposed
that
it
has
to
historically
meant
that
they
would
be
elected
at
large.
i
could
say
as
i
never
considered
the
question.
i
suggest
that
--
well,
i
--
what
i
was
about
to
say,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
it
will
stand
up,
but
when
we
talk
about
the
federal
analogy,
it
seems
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
me
we
ought
to
talk
about
it
historically
as
it
has
always
been.
certainly,
i
would
find
nothing
in
the
seventeenth
amendment
to
authorize
creating
districts
within
a
state
which
gave
the
people
of
--
which
put
--
attempt
the
number
of
people
in
one
district
that
was
in
another
as
there
is
in
delaware.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
i
assume
that
the
history
was
the
law,
your
honor.
i
had
never
reflected
on
the
point.
i
suspect
that
it
will
continue
to
be
the
practice.
appellants'
answer
to
our
point
about
the
lack
of
per
capita
representation
in
the
house
is
that
well,
the
house
--
the
purpose
was
to
make
the
apportionment
of
the
house
conform
to
population,
a
purpose
which
the
subsequent
unadopted
report
of
the
committee
would
have
effectuated.
well,
i
submit
that
if
that
was
their
purpose,
they
fell
far
short
and
we're
concerned
with
what
they
did
not
with
their
purposes.
and
so
far
as
their
future
intentions
go,
there
would
be
nothing
adjudicated
here
that
would
prevent
them
from
carrying
out
their
future
intentions
but
we're
concerned
now
with
the
constitutionality
of
something
on
the
books.
third,
in
delaware,
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
the
apportionment
of
seats
in
either
house
--
either
branch
of
the
delaware
legislature
whereas
the
apportionment
in
the
federal
constitution
is
certainly
in
accordance
with
an
intelligible
rule.
and
fourth,
we
find
out
that
delaware's
1963
amendment
creates
or
perhaps
i
should
say
continuous
gross
discrimination
of
a
kind
which
the
federal
system
has
never
created.
appellants
say
to
that
in
their
reply
brief
that
this
assertion
is
contrary
to
fact
and
they
go
on
to
say
that
inequalities
in
per
capita
representation
in
the
united
states
senate
are
greater
than
the
ine
--
inequalities
between
the
three
delaware
counties.
well,
that's
true,
but
i
think
its
a
little
acting
whoever
says
that
an
orange
is
different
from
an
apple
is
a
liar,
both
have
skin.
the
fact
is
that
there
are
many
other
kinds
of
gross
discrimination
under
the
delaware
apportionment
which
do
not
exist
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
first,
some
senatorial
districts
have
three,
four,
10
and
even
15
times
the
per
capita
representation
of
other
districts
in
the
same
county.
there's
nothing
similar
to
that
in
the
federal
arrangement.
second
is
gross
discrimination
in
the
lower
house,
both
between
counties
and
between
districts
in
different
counties.
on
the
average,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
the
people
of
kent
county
have
twice
the
per
capita
representation
in
the
lower
house
of
the
people
in
new
castle
county.
there's
nothing
in
the
federal
constitution
that
contemplates
that
kind
of
discrimination.
third,
a
numerical
majority
in
the
delaware
senate
could
come
from
districts
containing
only
28%
of
the
population.
there's
nothing
of
that
kind
required
or
sanctioned
by
the
federal
constitution.
so
we
think
that
taking
the
apportionment
that
is
before
the
court
and
comparing
it
with
the
federal
system
is
an
utter
lack
of
resemblance
and
all
the
argument
about
the
federal
analogy
is
utterly
beside
the
point.
appellants
say
in
their
reply
brief,
well,
the
issue
of
the
federal
analogy
is
inescapably
in
the
case
for
two
reasons.
first,
they
say
the
legislature
might
have
equalized
the
senatorial
districts
in
each
county.
well,
this
case
doesn't
concern
with
what
the
legislature
might
have
done.
it's
concerned
with
what
it
did
and
then
it
says
that
the
legislatures,
second,
might
have
followed
the
suggestion
that
we
made
in
our
brief.
well
again,
it
didn't
and
we're
not
concerned
with
what
might
have
been.
nor
i
submit
made
the
court
be
concerned
with
any
future
apportionment
that
might
be
enacted
by
the
delaware
legislature
that
may
or
may
not
satisfy
the
district
court.
the
decree
leaves
the
legislature
to
adopt
its
own
apportionment.
it
doesn't
forbid
the
adoption
of
a
plan
truly
analogous
to
the
federal
congress.
if
it
doesn't,
then
it
will
be
time
enough
to
adjudicate
that
question.
this
court
does
not
sit
and
certainly
in
this
field,
i
submit,
should
not
undertake
to
render
advisory
opinions
on
hypothetical
questions
that
are
not
here.
i
turn
now
to
the
second
point
that
i
--
that
i
wish
to
cover
and
that
is
--
excuse
me.
mr.
archibald
cox
now,
the
second
point
and
that
is
our
argument
that
taking
the
case
that
is
here,
the
apportionment
of
the
delaware
legislature
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
it
creates
gross
discrimination
between
persons
and
groups
of
persons
without
any
support
in
policy
whatsoever.
we're
contend
here
to
take
as
appellants
say
they're
content
to
take,
the
rule
suggested
by
baker
and
carr
to
it
that
if
the
discrimination
reflects
no
policy
but
simply
arbitrary
and
capricious
action
then
it
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
findings
of
the
district
court
and
the
undisputed
evidence,
we
think,
demonstrate
that
this
is
such
a
case.
i
don't
want
to
take
the
time
of
the
court
with
a
lot
of
figures
because
there's
something
that
have
to
be
again
looked
at
and
studied
in
order
really
to
grasp
them
that
if
you
were
to
look
at
the
tables
on
pages
25
and
again,
over
on
30
of
our
brief,
you'd
find
that
there
is
really
the
most
enormous
differences
in
the
number
of
people
in
each
district
and
remember
that
each
district
elects
one
representative
or
one
senator
as
the
case
may
be.
for
example
in
sussex
county,
you
find
the
8th
district
has
as
fewest
three
--
just
under
3000
people
and
the
10th
has
as
many
as
12,
the
9th
has
four
so
your
differences
of
2-to-1,
3-to1,
4-to1.
within
kent
county,
you
find
districts
running
up
from
2,
3,
and
4-to-1
up
to
a
difference
of
6-to-1.
within
the
city
of
new
castle
curiously,
you
find
the
difference
as
great
as
3-to-1
--
i
--
i
said
city
of
new
castle,
i
meant
city
of
wilmington
and
within
the
county
of
new
castle,
you
find
ratios
running
up
to
12-to-1
and
of
course,
you
find
differences
of
the
same
order
when
they
are
taken
across
county
whereas
i
was
stating
it
simply
between
counties,
at
page
25.
on
page
30,
we
deal
with
the
senate.
you'll
note
that
in
new
castle
county,
the
7th
senatorial
district
has
4000
people
and
the
6th
has
14,000
people.
the
others
run
up
to
63
to
64,000
people
with
a
couple
of
(inaudible).
kent
county,
there's
a
ratio
of
at
least
3-to-1
and
another
2-to-1.
sussex
county
is
a
little
bit
better.
they
are
the
worst
ratio
isn't
quite
as
bad
as
2-to-1.
if
you
compare
them
cross
county,
you
find
that
the
same
number
of
senators
are
assigned
to
the
300,000
people
in
new
castle
county
as
or
assigned
to
the
61,000
people
in
kent
county.
and
remember,
they
are
not
assigned
by
county.
those
figures
show
in
average
rather
than
specific
comparisons
because
comparison
can't
be
county
against
county.
mr.
archibald
cox
we've
--
we
found
no
explanation
of
this
except
to,
it
was
suggested
that
no
senator
could
be
expected
or
representative
could
be
expected
to
give
up
his
seat
so
there
was
no
use
proposing
a
plan
that
wouldn't
preserve
all
the
existing
district.
well
i
suggest
that
in
trench
power
is
not
a
constitutional
justification
for
a
denial
of
equality.
and
similarly
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that
would
be
the
same
in
the
house.
similarly,
it
is
said
that,
well,
the
existing
legislature
would
have
to
approve
the
plan.
therefore,
it
had
to
be
one
that
would
commend
itself
to
a
--
commend
itself
to
a
malapportioned
body,
but
i
submit
again
that
that
kind
of
justification
doesn't
show
the
differences
in
representation
to
be
rational.
certainly,
we
would
always
agree
that
if
the
matter
of
providing
transcripts
to
the
record
on
appeal
to
proper
defendants
in
criminal
cases
came
up
and
then
majority
of
the
legislature
said,
"we'll
never
stand
for
this.
it's
an
outrage.
the
supreme
court
is
all
wrong.”
they
finally
compromise
by
supplying
them
in
capital
cases
but
not
in
any
other
cases.
i
suppose
from
the
standpoint
of
one
seeking
legislation
it
might
be
rational
to
take
the
compromise
as
if
there
were
no
other
solution,
but
in
constitutional
terms
that's
not
an
acceptable
kind
of
justification.
and
you
can
imagine
other
cases.
i
suppose
that
my
state
of
massachusetts
years
ago
had
disenfranchised
irish
and
there
was
fight
in
the
legislature
over
it.
and
it
was
agreed
“well,
we
will
franchise
those
who
have
been
in
the
country
for
four
generations
or
three
generations.
now
this
is
the
only
way
we
can
get
a
bill
through.
it
would
make
the
discrimination
and
it
last
on
constitution
but
i
think
that's
essentially
what's
involved
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
think
the
future
man
who
came
into
court
and
appealed
that
he
would
have
standing
to
complain.
i
have
discussed
this,
justice
harlan,
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
at
some
little
length
in
our
brief.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
the
--
in
this
case,
we
didn't
deal
with
it
so
explicitly
in
the
earlier
cases
because
the
argument
kept
bringing
out
the
points
we
have
really
dealt
with,
but
that
point
is
fully
explained
in
our
brief
in
this
case.
there
are
some
other
reasons
assigned
and
i
would
like
to
try
to
deal
with
each
of
them
briefly.
in
the
first
place,
it
suggested
that
the
apportionment
is
rational
because
of
the
work
of
the
bipartisan
committee,
had
all
the
virtues
of
the
work
of
the
federal
constitutional
convention
and
that
indeed
they
pass
through
13
steps
of
procedure
in
expounding
this
plan
of
apportionment,
but
of
course,
we're
concerned
with
what
they
did.
i
have
no
desire
to
criticize
the
membership.
they
may
have
had
all
the
virtues
attributed
to
them,
but
it's
the
result
that
the
court
was
concerned
itself
with
and
similarly
the
procedure
that
it
went
through
13
steps
seems
hardly
decisive
for
all
unconstitutional
legislation
goes
through
a
good
number
of
steps
in
the
legislature
not
all
was
a
faithful
13
steps,
but
nevertheless,
it
does
go
through
committees
and
resolutions
imposed.
we're
told
here
substantively
that
one
of
the
things
that
justifies
the
apportionment
is
that
it
is
on
a
rational
geographical
basis.
unfortunately,
it
has
not
been
explained
to
us
just
what
this
rational
geographical
basis
is.
looking
at
it
and
there's
a
map
attached
to
the
complaint
so
you
can
see
the
configuration
of
the
district,
there
are
seven
within
each
county
but
i
don't
know
why
that's
particularly
rational
anymore
than
they
have
five
in
one,
eight
in
another
and
12
in
another.
even
within
the
counties,
the
districts
are
widely
different
in
area
and
population.
there
seems
to
be
no
relationship
between
the
area
of
the
population
that
no
significant
topographical
features
as
would
explain
to
us
at
bar.
the
two
floterial
districts
in
kent
county
are
divided
between
what
is
said
to
be
the
eastern
and
western
house
but
i
don't
suppose
that
that's
meant
to
explain
why
one
has
placed
as
many
people
in
it
and
therefore
half
the
representation
of
the
other.
it's
suggested
the
likelihood
of
population
growth
in
the
future
would
wipe
out
these
inequities.
well,
it
might,
but
when
the
county
has
to
increase
15-fold,
and
another
one
has
to
increase
a
12-fold
and
another
one
has
to
increase
11-fold
and
many
of
them
8-fold,
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
hope
that
maybe
it
will
someday
in
the
hereafter
workout
fairly
is
not
enough
to
justify
in
--
unfairness
in
the
present
choice
of
the
legislature.
then
it
is
said
that
this
was
compelled
by
time.
mr.
theisen
has
pointed
out
one
answer
to
that
and
that
is
that
the
district
court
taking
the
facts
and
provisions
of
the
delaware
constitution
really
acted
quite
reasonably.
another
answer,
i
suggest,
is
that
when
constitutional
ranks
are
denied,
it's
not
a
sufficient
answer
to
say,
"oh,
we
did
it
in
a
hurry.
"
the
appellants
are
here
arguing
that
this
plan
as
a
permanent
continuing
piece
of
legislation
conforms
to
the
equal
protection
clause.
indeed,
they
explain
in
answer
to
a
question
before
the
bench
that
they
didn't
want
to
moot
the
case,
they
didn't
want
to
make
this
into
stopgap
legislation
and
enact
another
permanent
end
until
they
had
their
whack
in
having
this
one
upheld.
well,
then
it
must
be
judged
as
continuing
permanent
legislature.
none
of
these
explanations,
i
submit
in
conclusion,
explain
the
gross
inequalities
that
exist
between
the
senatorial
districts
and
the
representative
districts.
indeed,
i
have
yet
to
hear
the
explanation
that
was
going
to
be
given
to
justice
goldberg
for
the
difference
in
size
between
the
districts
--
the
senatorial
districts
in
new
castle
county.
finally,
i
want
to
say
just
a
word
with
reference
to
the
argument
based
on
the
early
history
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
early
cases
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
their
only
relevance,
as
i
see
it,
is
to
an
attack
upon
baker
and
carr.
i
recognized
that
counsel
claims
that,
but
i
cannot
so
the
life
of
me
saying
what
bearing
the
quotations
from
minor
and
happersett
have
or
the
references
to
the
fifteenth
and
eighteenth
amendments
have
or
to
fifteenth
--
thank
you,
fifteenth
and
nineteenth
amendments
have
or
that
the
quotations
from
congressman
bingham
have
unless
it
is
an
argument
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
nothing
to
do
with
case
--
with
questions
that
have
to
do
with
voting.
now,
there
it
is
all
water
long
over
the
bend.
it
is
but
settled
ever
since
nixon
and
herndon
in
273
u.s.
that
the
fourteenth
--
that
the
equal
protection
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
clause
does
have
something
to
do
with
voting
right.
true,
it
is
still
up
to
the
states
to
lay
down
the
qualifications
for
voting,
but
the
guarantee
of
equal
protection
applies
to
the
opportunity
to
participate
at
primaries,
to
the
right
to
have
your
vote
counted
equally
with
other
votes
so
as
to
prevent
against
frauds,
stuffing
the
ballot
box
and
such
to
voting
--
to
having
your
vote
counted
as
one
vote
in
an
election
for
governor.
and
as
i
read
the
decision
in
baker
v.
carr,
it
applies
to
the
claim
of
equality
and
the
right
to
representation.
so
that
going
back
over
that
history,
it
seems
to
me
quite
unnecessary
at
this
stage.
now,
appellant
say
that
the
references
to
the
readmission
of
florida
and
the
other
discussion
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
intended
to
show
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
require
the
principle
one
man,
one
vote
to
be
applied
to
representation
in
both
houses
of
the
legislature.
certainly
no
such
question
is
raised
by
this
case
and
i
think
no
such
question
is
raised
by
any
of
the
other
cases
that
have
been
argued
here
during
the
past
month.
someday,
that
question
may
come
here.
someday
it
may
have
to
be
considered,
but
certainly
florida's
constitution,
in
terms
of
what
was
known
about
it
when
it
came
before
the
congress
in
the
1860s,
is
no
justification
for
what
we
know
about
the
delaware
apportionment
today.
all
that
appeared
on
the
face
of
the
florida
constitution
was
that
every
county
in
the
lower
house
was
assured
at
least
one
representative
and
then
remaining
representatives
were
to
be
apportioned
per
capita
and
nothing
appeared
on
the
face
of
it
about
the
upper
house,
but
quite
plainly
that
isn't
altogether
a
different
case
than
is
before
us
in
terms
of
the
delaware
situation.
i
think
one
another
thing
should
be
said
about
the
history.
it
is
not
quite
as
easy
as
appellants'
quotations
from
the
objection
to
the
readmission
of
florida
and
the
reply
by
benjamin
butler
make
out.
in
the
first
place,
there
was
considerable
amount
of
debate
in
between
and
while
congressman
farnsworth
of
illinois,
of
course
said
what
colonel
wiener
said
he
said,
he
made
a
great
many
other
points.
congressman
butler
took
out
for
all
the
arguments
that
have
been
made
by
congressman
farnsworth
and
at
least
one
other
representative
and
answered
each
of
them
one
by
one
except
this
matter
of
apportionment
and
it
was
after
that
that
he
said,
"all
these
matters
have
been
going
into
by
our
committees."
mr.
archibald
cox
not
only
that.
i
would
fully
concur
with
that.
i
would
go
one
step
further.
the
conclusion
i
brought
i
suppose
all
this
history
once
across
different
conclusion.
the
conclusion
i
would
draw
was
that
the
first
of
the
argument
was
--
let's
take
florida
in
anyway.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
partly
that.
partly,
it
was
pointed
out
on
the
florida
that
the
house
committee
on
reconstruction
had
repeatedly
turned
down
to
florida
constitution
and
had
repeatedly
found
themselves
dissatisfied
with
it.
i
don't
mean
to
imply
that
anything
has
to
do
with
apportionment
because
i
don't
know
of
the
slightest
grieves
to
think
so.
but
it
had
repeatedly
rejected
and
this
is
stated
in
about
the
same
part
of
the
debate
that
the
quotations
are
taken
from
a
little
bit
late.
the
thrust
of
the
argument
for
readmitting
florida
was
i
would
say
two-fold
or
two
points
in
addition
to
that
mentioned
by
justice
goldberg.
the
first
was
what
else
are
we
going
to
do?
we've
got
to
get
on
here.
we
can't
remand
florida
back
to
the
state
as
territory.
what
else
are
we
going
to
do
but
to
take
or
despite
the
committee's
dissatisfaction
and
that's
what
the
committee
recommended.
and
the
second
thing
was
that
we
need
florida
in
for
the
purpose
of
having
the
fourteenth
amendment
ratified
so
as
well
are
your
doubts
and
vote
to
have
florida
readmitted.
in
other
words,
it
comes
to
what
mr.
justice
douglas
suggested
if
i
heard
him
right
this
morning
to
words
that
there
was
a
political
decision
to
readmit
florida,
governmental
decision,
i
mean
political
in
that
sense
and
not
a
scrutinizing
of
everything
florida
had
done
or
stood
for
with
the
idea
of
writing
it
as
a
rubric
on
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
yet
to
be
adopted.
so
that
we
think
to
preclude
that
the
arguments
are
directed
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
insofar
as
they
attempt
to
overrule
all
the
cases
from
nixon
and
condon
and
nixon
and
herndon
down
to
gray
and
sanders
come
much
too
late
and
that
so
far
as
they
are
directed
to
sustaining
this
delaware
apportionment,
they
simply
missed
the
point.
