let's
assume
that
a
staying
had
10
counties
and
that
the
legislature
was
apportioned
by
giving
as
many
senators
to
each
county
as
there
were
syllables
in
the
name
of
the
county,
what

be
ascertainable
--
intelligible?

justice
potter
stewart

just
two?
justice

stewart

they
meet
off
and

throughout
the
biennium
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
every
year.
