justice
tom
c.
clark
i
thought
he
filed
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
district
attorney
--(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
asked
for
a
speedy
trial.
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
file
a
new
charge.
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
in
the
city
court,
so
then
we
went
back
five
days
later,
i
gather,
i
all
i
know
is
what
is
in
the
record.
he
then
went
back
to
the
state
court
five
days
later
and
dismissed
the
charge,
which
is
very
often
done
by
the
district
attorney.
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
that
a
different
court?
justice
tom
c.
clark
charged
with
battery
when
the
first
one
didn't
charge?
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
in
this
case,
it's
here,
they
have
been
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
was
all
done
before
we
took
jurisdiction
you
say,
so
you
had
your
plea
in
the
other
case
in
may,
then
you
had
your
dismissal
in
june
of
this
case
and
then
we
granted
cert
in
october.
justice
tom
c.
clark
way
after
what?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
there
wouldn't
be
any
--
wouldn't
come
in
under
case
at
trial,
we
were
frustrated
of
any
jurisdiction
because
we
had
no
jurisdiction,
we
had
granted
the
cert.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
i'm
with
you
on
that.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
have
to
look
at
the
jurisdiction
whether
â€“
so
you
haven't
had
any
louisiana
court
pass
on
those
problems
or
on
whether
or
not
the
confession
was
coerced
or
rather
their
plea
was
coerced.
so
while
your
statement
is
very
appealing
to
what
this
man
suffered
and
i
would
like
to
help
you
on
it,
i
don't
know
how
we
could
under
our
sit
out,
under
our
jurisdiction,
it's
included
in
our
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
louisiana
hasn't
held
that
have
they,
that
hasn't
been
taken
to
louisiana
and
for
our
jurisdiction
you
have
to
take
to
the
state
court.
justice
tom
c.
clark
didn't
say
that
what
the
statue
is
vague
or
not,
said
the
charge
is
no
criminal
offense.
