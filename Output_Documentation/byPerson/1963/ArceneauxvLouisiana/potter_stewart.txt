what
was
the
ground
for
that
motion?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
where
did
you
ever
pray
for
that,
until
you
got
here?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
something
that
--
generally
you
have
to
begin
some
where
else,
you
can't
just
come
to
this
court
do
novo
and
say
erase
the
conviction.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
was
in
the
trial
court.
justice
potter
stewart
sounds
criminal
trespass
more,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
there
isn't,
but
the
statute
says
that
you
have
to
be
unlawfully
there,
and
that's
criminal.
so
if
i
go
home
tonight
and
find
somebody
in
my
house
who
is
a
visitor,
obviously
he
is
not
guilty
of
anything,
but
if
i
find
somebody
there
who
has
broken
in,
he
is
unlawfully
there.
justice
potter
stewart
but
how?
justice
potter
stewart
whether
or
not
it
is
lawful
and
what's
so
unlawful
about
walking
down
the
street?
justice
potter
stewart
lawful,
that's
the
unlawful
presence.
