justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
before
the
state
supreme
court
mr.
simon.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
plea
of
guilty,
the
coerced
plea
of
guilty?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
the
louisiana
supreme
court
does
not
have
these
facts
before
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
proceeding
in
the
louisiana
by
which
you
could
--
no
collateral
post
conviction
proceeding
by
which
you
could
have
attacked
this
coerced
plea?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you've
never
done
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
honest
trouble
is
you
are
asking
us
to
pass
on
questions
here
apart
from
what
mr.
justice
brennan
has
said
that
the
--
no
louisiana
courts
have
ever
faced
them
â€“-
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
this
is
a
different
question
as
to
whether
we
have
any
jurisdiction
apart
from
all
this.
these
questions
are
never
raised
before
any
louisiana
court.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
talking
about
the
coerced
plea,
the
illegal
detention,
all
those
things
were
never
raised
apparently
before
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
has
been
--
makes
it
difficult
for
us
to
do
anything
about
it
because
he
is
now
out
of
jail.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
we
have
got
before
us
the
question
of
the
ratio
of
this
coerced
plea
under
the
circumstances
that
you've
narrated
because
that
isn't
involved
in
this
petition
and
furthermore
it
has
never
been
passed
upon
by
any
state
court.
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
the
state
court
and
they
denied
your
relief
on
these
set
of
facts
and
they
have
actually
established
and
of
course
you
have
a
constitutional
claim
of
the
first
order
which
we
could
review
but
those
questions
aren't
here.
justice
john
m.
harlan
rely
on
what
you
say
in
page
27
of
your
draft
brief
where
you
ask
the
statue
be
declared
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
my
trouble
--
let
me
put
this
question
to
you,
let's
assume
that
this
was
properly
raised
or
was
raised
in
what
was
before
the
supreme
court,
at
that
stage
of
the
matter
the
case
had
not
been
tried,
it
was
simply
attacking
the
indictment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
denial
results
in
the
case
going
back
for
a
trial
at
that
stage.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
is
that
a
final
order
that
we
can
review?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
i'm
talking
about
our
jurisdiction
because
theoretically
this
case
is
after
denial
could
have
gone
back
to
the
trial
court
and
if
your
client
had
not
pleaded
guilty
it
could
have
been
tried,
he
might
have
been
acquitted.
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
a
matter
then
there
would
have
been
nothing
for
this
court
obviously
that
you
would
bring
up.
my
question
is
how
is
this
a
final
order
at
that
stage?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
design
it
from
the
standpoint
of
your
law,
but
we
have
to
--
our
jurisdiction
is
submitted
by
our
federal
statues
to
bind
orders.
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
didn't
state
it?
