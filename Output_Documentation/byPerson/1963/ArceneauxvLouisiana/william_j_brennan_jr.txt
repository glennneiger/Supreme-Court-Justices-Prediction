justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
simon,
i'm
looking
in
page
29
of
your
brief
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
you
have
this
statute,
do
i
understand
that
the
prosecution
was
for
subdivision
8?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
question
about
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
long
was
he
held?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
from
effective
(inaudible),
the
day
he
was
arrested
(inaudible)
for
how
long?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
one
month?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
finally
get
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
finally
got
in
touch
with
you
some
time
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
what
happened
after
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
which
judge
is
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
were
up
to
march
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
long
does
it
take
for
you
to
get
to
the
supreme
court
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
quash
the
information?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
referred
any
of
your
applications
anywhere
for
relief,
any
federal
constitutional
question
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
were
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
after
the
order
you
took
exception
to.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
but
afterwards,
it
was
after
the
court
ruling
of
march
the
9th
that
you
then
took
exception,
and
i
don't
know
what
that
means,
but
it
didn't
call
for
any
further
action
by
the
court,
did
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
did
it
include
any
federal
constitutional
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
well
did
that
--
when
i'm
trying
to
get
at,
when
you
first
explicitly
asserted
federal
constitutional
claims.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
formally
you
did
make
the
same
representations
on
federal
constitution
grounds
in
your
motion
to
quash
the
information.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
we're
up
to
may.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
we're
up
to
may,
aren't
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
back
to
the
city
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
identical
charge
was
now
in
the
city
court,
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
according
the
record
of
the
--
oh
no,
of
course
not
because
all
this
happen
after
(inaudible)
while
the
petition
was
pending
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
is
the
charge
itself
–
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
just
ask?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
i
gather
mr.
simon
that
at
the
time
we
passed
on
your
petition
for
certiorari
and
granted
it,
none
of
the
facts
of
any
event
after
march
was
before
us,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
everything
--
and
what
we
agreed
to
review
was
a
judgment,
sort
of
judgment
whatever
it
maybe
of
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
which
denied
you
the
review
of
the
denial
of
habeas
corpus
and
the
application
for
original
habeas
corpus,
the
application
for
certiorari,
prohibition
and
mandamus,
that's
what
we
agreed
to
review,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
how
can
we
in
the
face
of
what
happened
after
march?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
by
which
that
might
have
been
reviewed,
i
gather
now
he
had
been
released,
he
was
out.
so
i
suppose
habeas
corpus,
couldn't
proceed
on
habeas
corpus,
but
is
there
--
isn't
there
some
procedure
in
louisiana
by
which
you
could
have
attacked
that
coerced
guilty
plea?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
how
can
we
do
it
mr.
simon?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
agree
it's
rather
outrageous,
it
seems
to
me,
but
i
don't
know
if
we
can
do
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
those
cases
apply
only
in
federal
prosecutions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
may
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
believe
me
i
am
not
against
you
–
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
because
this
certainly
sounds
outrageous
to
me.
the
difficulty
is
how
do
you
escape
--
this
is
utterly
moot,
that
is
what
we
agreed
to
review,
is
that
any
longer
open?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
any
consequences
that
hangover
persist
after
a
release
of
a
prisoner,
after
he
has
served
his
sentences
or
any
disabilities,
any
civil
disabilities
in
louisiana?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
the
vagrancy
statute
in
the
sense
i
ordinarily
understand
the
vagrancy
statute
with
all
the
specificity.
they
could
have
--
without
using
the
word
vagrancy
i
gather
this
statute
could
be
read
as
making
an
offense
by
any
person
found
in
or
in
any
structure,
movable
vessel
or
private
(inaudible)
of
being
able
to
account
for
his
lawful
presence
therein,
that
doesn't
sound
to
me
ordinarily
like
a
vagrancy.
