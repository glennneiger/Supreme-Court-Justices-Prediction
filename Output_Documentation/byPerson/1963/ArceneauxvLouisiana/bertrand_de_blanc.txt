mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
may
i
proceed
your
honor?
may
it
please
the
court.
our
position
is
that
the
question
has
become
moot.
our
position
is
first
that
the
question
has
become
moot
because
there
is
no
controversy,
that
there
is
no
adversity
that
the
relief
sought
cannot
be
granted
and
second
that
the
district
court
did
not
err
in
denying
the
accused
a
preliminary
examination
and
third
that
the
vagrancy
laws
are
not
vague,
does
not
penalize
our
status
and
that
the
vagrancy
laws
have
generally
been
held
to
be
constitution
and
fourth
that
no
federal
question
was
presented,
because
no
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
properly
presented
to
any
court.
now
your
honors,
i
think
that
this
case
should
be
presented
to
your
honors
on
the
record
and
we
should
stick
to
the
record
and
the
record
consists
of
an
affidavit
which
was
made
against
the
accused
charging
him
with
vagrancy.
that
there
was
a
warrant
issued
for
his
arrest,
a
valid
warrant
issued
for
his
arrest,
a
valid
affidavit
made
out
charging
him
with
vagrancy
of
crime
in
the
state
of
louisiana
and
that
he
was
found
near
a
structure
without
being
able
to
account
for
his
presence
therein,
that
was
a
motion
for
a
preliminary
examination
made
on
his
behalf
by
counsel,
that
after
that
the
state
filed
a
bill
of
information
against
the
accused
based
upon
the
affidavit
and
based
on
the
same
offence.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
there
is
no
evidence
your
honors
that
he
was
ever
arrested.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
what
happened
to
the
warrant,
whether
it
was
executed
or
not.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
there
is
no
record
that
he
was
ever
in
jail.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
yes
he
was,
but
that's
--
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
well
your
honor
if
i
told
you
it
would
be
yes
hearsay.
i
saw
him
in
jail
later
on
when
he
asked
me
to
go
out
and
talk
to
him
wanting
to
plead
guilty.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
yes
your
honor
he
was,
but
there
is
evidence,
and
the
record
does
not
contain
that
fact,
so
i
don't
know
how
this
court
is
able
to
determine
that
he
was
arrested,
because
the
record
doesn't
show
that.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
no
it
doesn't
show
that
he
was
in
jail.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
well,
your
honor
i
could
talk
off
the
record
and
tell
you
that
he
was
properly
arrested.
now
there
was
a
bill
of
information
filed
by
the
district
attorney
charging
him
with
the
same
offence
in
the
same
affidavit,
what
we
do
is
we
do
not
prosecute
in
the
district
court
on
affidavits,
we
prosecute
on
bills
of
information
which
are
based
upon
affidavits.
we
prosecute
in
city
court
on
affidavits.
now
there
was
a
recall
of
the
preliminary
examination
by
the
judge
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
district
attorney
had
filed
a
bill
of
information.
there
was
request
for
writs
and
a
prayer
for
preliminary
a
examination
and
for
habeas
corpus.
now
that's
all
the
record
and
that
is
all
there
is
to
the
record.
now
the
question
is
--
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
now
he
was
--
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
there
is
something
in
a
record
your
honors
show
that
he
was
in
jail,
that
he
was
arrested.
we
--
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
yes
your
honor.
now
he
has
prayed
in
his
preliminary
--
request
for
preliminary
examination.
he
asked
for
a
preliminary
examination
and
he
incidentally
mentioned
the
word
habeas
corpus,
but
he
never
at
any
time
asked
for
habeas
corpus,
there
was
never
any
petition
on
his
part
requesting
habeas
corpus.
habeas
corpus
has
to
be
made
in
the
name
of
the
state
of
louisiana
and
on
the
relation
of
the
person
in
custody.
the
petition
has
to
state
by
whom
the
accused
is
deprived
of
his
liberty
and
that
was
no
done.
there
was
no
affidavit
attached
attesting
to
the
truth
of
the
allegation
and
as
a
matter
of
act
the
accused
in
this
case
was
actually
asking
for
a
preliminary
examination.
now
your
honor
we
feel
that
that's
the
record
and
there
is
nothing
that
in
that
record
which
shows
that
the
accused
was
in
any
way
illegally
deprived
of
his
liberty.
there
is
nothing
in
that
record
that
shows
that
he
was
kept
in
jail
incommunicado
or
that
he
was
denied
access
to
his
attorney.
the
sheriff
in
that
particular
parish
was
reelected
last
week
and
he
is
an
honorable
man.
he
has
--
he
does
not
keep
people
incommunicado
in
his
jail.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
no
sir.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
yes
sir
your
honor
he
was
in
jail.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
no
sir
he
was
not,
not
held
incommunicado,
i
can
tell
you
he
was
not
and
it's
not
in
the
record,
that
he
was.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
he
was
in
jail
four
months.
now
he
--
after
he
requested
for
--
he
requested
a
preliminary
examination
our
file
of
bill
of
information
against
him,
my
assistant
mr.
logan
was
the
one
who
handled
that
at
the
time
that
the
affidavit
was
filed
or
give
him
--
permit
to
file
it,
gave
the
deputy
sheriff
a
permit
to
file
the
charge
against
the
accused,
but
our
file
bill
of
information
and
was
ready
to
try
the
case
and
he
would
have
been
tried
in
about
three
weeks,
but
he
filed
a
petition
for
--
he
filed
for
writs
in
the
meantime
and
so
that
it
took
it
of
our
hands.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
no
sir
writs
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
denying
on
the
--
stating
that
the
district
court
had
prevented
him
or
denied
him
a
preliminary
examination.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
in
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
he
asked
--
he
mentioned
a
preliminary
--
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
but
he
did
not
state
by
whom
the
accused
was
being
held
or
he
did
not
serve
the
sheriff,
if
that
was
the
one
who
he
said
was
holding
the
accused.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
he
did
not,
(inaudible)
in
other
words
his
application
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court
was
not
properly
made
and
his
application
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
was
not
properly
made
as
there
was
no
showing
that
in
the
supreme
court
that
he
had
a
made
a
request
on
the
district
judges,
all
three
district
judges
as
required
by
law,
and
that
hey
were
not
--
they
were
absent,
recused
or
were
prevented
from
acting
in
this
case.
he
did
not
present
this
case,
a
case
of
habeas
corpus,
before
either
the
district
court
or
before
the
louisiana
supreme
court
and
your
honor
he
was
--
on
the
30th
of
may
without
any
coercion
whatsoever,
you
went
to
the
city
court
and
pleaded
guilty
to
the
crime
charged.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
his
counsel
was
not
present
at
the
time
and
he
according
to
the
affidavits
stated
that
he
had
discharged
his
fine
--
counsel
and
that
he
was
no
longer
represented
by
a
counsel
and
in
my
answer
to
his
application
here,
i
attached
affidavits
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
showing
that
the
docket
books
from
the
district
attorney's
office
showed
transfer
to
the
district
court,
that
the
accused
stated
in
open
court
that
he
had
discharged
his
counsel
and
wished
to
represent
himself.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
an
affidavit
by
me,
district
attorney
which
was
attached
to
my
answer,
here
in
this
court
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
a
moot
question
and
wherein
i
stated
that
he
--
the
accused
called
me
up
and
took
from
my
office
in
the
court
house
up
to
the
jail,
on
may
the
3rd.
and
that
i
went
to
see
him
and
that
he
asked
--
i
asked
him
what
he
wanted.
he
wanted
to
know
when
his
case
was
coming
up.
i
told
him
i
simply
wanted
to
know
what
he
wanted
to
talk
to
me
about,
but
insofar
as
this
case
was
concerned
he
had
a
lawyer
and
all
matters
should
be
done
through
his
lawyer.
he
said
he
had
acquired
a
lawyer
to
simply
get
his
wages
from
his
employer.
he
said
he
felt
that
his
sentence
under
the
guilty
plea
would
be
less
than
the
time
he
would
get
in
jail.
i
told
him
that
if
he
wanted
to
plead
guilty,
he
would
have
to
talk
to
his
lawyer
or
he
would
have
discharge
his
lawyer
and
make
the
plea
himself
as
an
affidavit
which
i
filed
in
my
answer.
i
also
attached
affidavits
by
mr.
william
logan
who
is
the
assistant
district
attorney.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
they're
in
as
part
of
the
attached
to
my
answer
your
honor
in
this
court.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
i
also
attached
several
affidavits
by
deputy
sheriff,
who
said
what
happened,
that
he
tried
to
get
his
attorney
on
the
phone,
tell
him
that
he
wanted
to
plead
guilty.
there
are
several
affidavits
by
the
deputy
sheriffs
which
were
attached
to
the
--my
answer
in
this
court.
now
your
honors
insofar
as
to
--
as
the
point
that
i
want
to
make
that
this
is
a
moot
question.
i
came
across
a
case
just
before
i
left
louisiana
monday
morning,
and
i
would
like
to
be
able
cite
it,
i
have
already
given
the
case
to
mr.
simon
here
and
--
be
permitted
to
file
the
supplemental
brief.
it's
a
case
which
came
up
in
1960
which
i
had
i
no
notice
off
hand,
which
is
right
in
point
insofar
as
the
dismissal
is
concerned.
it's
--
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
we
didn't
considered
that
part
of
the
record
your
honor
since
that's
the
next
40
affidavit
and
we
did
not
get
a
chance
--
it
was
--
those
facts
were
not
--
aren't
controverted.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
i
didn't
put
it
in
the
record.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
do
i
have
anything
to
say
to
you?
no
i
don't
agree
with
next
40
affidavit,
because
it
would
not
--
that's
fact
was
never
established
in
any
court
of
law.
that
fact
was
never
established
where
that
he
was
held
incommunicado.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
well
the
state
did
not
have
a
chance
to
establish
the
true
facts
in
any
proceeding
and
certainly
he
could
have
established
those
facts
himself.
the
accused
through
counsel
could
have
done
so
had
he
properly
asked
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
he
would
have
been
granted
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
a
district
court
and
he
would
have
been
able
to
establish
all
of
those
facts,
but
he
never
did
ask
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
it
was
never
presented
to
the
district
court
and
at
the
time
the
district
court
passed
upon
the
motion
for
a
preliminary
examination,
the
judge
in
granting
the
preliminary
examination
at
the
very
beginning,
then
recalled
it
after
he
had
found
out
that
the
state
has
filed
a
bill
of
information.
it
was
never
urged
upon
the
district
court
that
he
should
have
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
for
all
these
matters
to
be
presented.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
your
honor
i
said
that
there
was
no
application
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
supreme
court
in
order
for
him
to
succeed
for
a
writ
--
to
obtain
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
he
has
to
show
that
he
has
exhausted
his
remedies
in
a
district
court
by
applying
to
three
judges
in
that
--
in
the
district
court,
applying
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court
and
showing
that
they
were
not
able
to
act
upon
that.
he
had
not
exhausted
his
remedies
when
he
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
well
it
was
not
--
they
did
not
state
what
--
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
no
sir.
yes
your
honor.
that's
--
i
feel
that's
part
of
the
reason
not
entirely.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
the
louisiana
statutes
require
under
article
144,
it
says
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
maybe
issued
by
the
supreme
court
or
any
justice
thereof
at
the
instance
of
the
person
in
actual
custody,
in
any
case
when
the
court
may
have
appellant
jurisdiction
by
the
district
court,
at
the
instance
of
the
person
in
actual
custody
in
their
respective
districts,
provided
that
neither
the
supreme
court
nor
any
justice
thereof
except
in
cases
provided
for
in
article
96
and
116
shall
issue
said
writ
unless
every
district
judge
of
criminal
jurisdiction
in
the
district
in
which
the
relator
is
in
custody
be
absent,
recused
or
prevented
from
some
cause
from
acting
and
unless
such
actions,
recusation
or
disability
is
made
to
appear
by
oath
of
the
relator
or
by
other
sufficient
proof.
now
your
honor
the
case
that
i
was
going
to
cite
if
i
may,
and
i've
already
given
it
to
him
this
morning
was
parker
versus
ellis,
which
citation
is
80
supreme
court
909
decided
in
1960
and
this
is
a
case
which
came
out
of
texas
i
believe.
the
accused
had
already
served
his
sentence
in
the
state
penitentiary
when
the
case
came
up
before
this
court,
and
was
held
by
this
court,
that
this
court
would
not
adjudicate
a
matter
in
which
it's
judgment
cannot
operate
and
as
the
only
judicial
relief
provide
for
by
the
statue
authorizing
the
issuance
of
the
habeas
corpus
writ,
is
a
discharge
of
the
prisoner
or
his
admission
to
bail
and
that
issue
has
become
moot.
now,
we
feel
that
this
is
the
same
situation.
he
voluntarily
pleaded
guilty
to
the
charge
which
was
filed
against
him.
that
was
transferred
from
the
district
court,
the
affidavit
was
transferred
from
the
district
court
to
the
city
court
upon
his
request
to
plea
guilty
in
the
city
court.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
yes
your
honor.
now
the
judge
himself
in
an
affidavit
which
was
cited
by
mr.
simon
states
that
he
himself
told
the
judge
at
that
he
was
unrepresented
by
counsel.
in
the
supplemental
brief,
counsel,
mr.
simon
filed
this
affidavit
by
the
presiding
judge
as
appendix
c
wherein
he
said
that
the
man
appeared
in
court
and
that
he
was
asked
whether
he
was
represented
by
legal
counsel
and
he
said
he
was
not
represented
by
legal
counsel,
was
appearing
for
himself.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
that's
right
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
well,
its
customary
there
for
the
judge
or
the
district
attorney
to
ask
him
the
question
and
was
asked
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
well,
your
honor
i
would
say
that
we
probably
would
make
a
distinction
between
whether
or
not
the
man
was
charged
with
a
felony
or
misdemeanor
and
that
if
he
was
charged
with
the
misdemeanor,
he
came
in
and
said
he
wanted
to
represent
himself
and
that
he
had
discharged
to
his
attorney
that
we
would
not
go
ahead
and
call
the
attorney
up
to
find
out
whether
he
was
discharged,
had
been
discharged
or
not,
but
i
specifically
told
this
man
if
he
want
to
plead
he
had
either
fire
his
attorney
or
go
out
and
plead
himself.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
no
sir.
now
i
would
like
to
say
this,
that
this
affidavit
was
transferred,
this
is
the
same
affidavit,
same
original
affidavit
was
transferred.
we
do
it
all
the
time
because
these
two
courts
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
insofar
as
misdemeanors
are
concerned,
it
was
transferred
because
we
do
it
every
week
when
somebody
wants
to
plead
guilty
because
we
have
court
there
every
week,
in
the
city
court
and
we
don't
have
court,
but
once
every
six
months
in
the
district
court
for
misdemeanors
--
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
it's
about
55,000
and
we've
handled
numerous
cases
there
every
thursday,
so
this
was
transferred
along
with
other
cases
which
were
transferred
there
but
it's
the
same
affidavit.
now,
one
in
the
district
court,
the
bill
of
information
was
based
upon
this
same
affidavit.
so
as
i
said
we'd
prosecute
him
on
bills
of
information
of
district
court
in
affidavits
of
the
city
court
and
in
order
to
clear
the
record
after
he
had
pleaded
guilty
in
city
court
on
a
misdemeanor
affidavit
then
and
cross
the
case,
dismiss
the
case
in
a
district
court
just
for
the
record
would
be
clear,
so
he
is
not
charged
with
any
offence
either
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
city
court.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
your
honor,
the
only
remedy
we
would
have
had
was
that
10
days
--
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
at
the
present
his
prescription
has
set
in,
prescription
so
far
as
an
appeal
is
concerned
or
writs
after
the
conviction,
i
don't
know
of
any
remedy
now
at
the
present
time.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
i
don't
know
of
any
your
honor,
i
might
think
about
the
time,
i
don't
know
of
any
off
hand.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
well,
you
see
in
this
particular
case
where
the
misdemeanor
carries
a
penalty
of
less
than
six
months
not
more
than
six
months
and
less
than
$300
fine
then
there
is
no
appeal
you
have
to
go
up
on
writs.
he
would
have
had
the
right
to
go
up
on
writs.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honor
that
could
very
well
be
that
his,
that
he
could
still
be
entitled
to
go
up
on
writs
in
this
particular
case
since
the
appeal,
the
time
for
appeal
is
ten
days
and
it
may
very
well
be
that,
that
it's
not
prescribed
so
far
as
writs
i
couldn't
tell
you
i
don't
know
i
couldn't
--
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
the
appeal
would
not
lie
in
this
particular
--
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
that's
right
your
honor
now
--
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
no
your
honor,
off
hand
it
may
very
well
be
that
he
is
would
be
still
entitled
to
it.
i
can't
think
of
any
prescription
on
it.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
i
believe
that
under
the
writs
of
habeas
corpus
he
could
bring
anything
in
or
bring
in
any
facts
that
were
pertinent
to
any
illegal
incarceration.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
well,
that
is
what
i
--
that
is
only
bad
part
about
habeas
corpus
he
had
not
confined,
he
no
longer
confined
and
i
don't
know
any
other.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
no
your
honor.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
that's
right.
now
he
has
never
--
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
i'll
be
very
happy
to
do
that
your
honor,
i'll
be
very
happy
to
do
that.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
yes
your
honor
and
i
will
be
able
to
cite
the
cases
on
moot
point
at
the
time
is
that
right
your
honor.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
now,
your
honors,
coming
to
the
question
--
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
thank
you.
coming
to
the
point
the
question
of
the
vagrancy
statute,
incidentally
i
just
wanted
to
stress
the
point
that
after
the
district
attorney
files
a
bill
of
information
that
the
accused
is
no
longer
entitled
as
a
matter
of
right
to
a
preliminary
examination
and
that
is
reason
why
the
judge
recalled
his
order
for
a
preliminary
examination
and
we
do
it
all
the
time.
the
reason
simply
is
that
we
don't
want
to
try
the
case
twice
when
the
case
is
coming
up
in
the
near
future.
in
this
particular
case
the
next
couple
of
weeks
we
would
have
been
fall,
we
would
be
having
a
misdemeanor
week
and
then
also
in
the
view
of
the
fact
that
we
don't
prosecute
on
affidavits
that
was
the
reason.
now,
i
have
to
go
to
the
vagrancy
statute,
i
have
cited
cases
that
show
in
that,
that
it's
within
the
police
power
of
the
state
to
enact
these
vagrancy
statutes
and
that
they
are
passed
to
prevent
crimes
that
may
have
flow
from
vagrancy
ways
of
actions
all
their
life
that
there
is
no
cases
which
was
cited
by
the
appellant
that
vagrancy
statute
was
unconstitutional.
this
one
here,
the
part
he
is
attacking
of
course
is
only
that
part
of
the
statute
which
provides
that
no
person
may
be
found
in
here
any
structure,
movable
vessel
or
private
grounds
without
being
able
to
account
for
their
lawful
presence
they
are
in,
and
of
course
this
prevents
people
from,
say
lie
and
awake
in
a
building
or
structure
would
be
intended
to
commit
a
crime.
the
statutes
have
been
held
to
be
constitutional
or
valid
exercise
of
police
power
of
the
states
in
the
main
because
these
statutes
have
been
upheld
as
constitutional,
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
one
in
this
in
the
district
of
columbia
which
is
very
similar
to
louisiana's
statute.
mr.
bertrand
de
blanc
this
court
has
not
passed
on
that
particular
statute
your
honor.
we
submit
the
case
unless
there
are
any
questions.
thank
you,
honor.
