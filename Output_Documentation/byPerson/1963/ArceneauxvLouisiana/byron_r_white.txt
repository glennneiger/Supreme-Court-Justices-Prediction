he
was
charged
with
certainly
he
knew
he
was
charged
with
vagrancy.
justice
byron

(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
--
at
one
time
that
was
a
guilty
pleading.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
circumstance
of
the
guilty
plea?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
no
your
own
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
you
do
something
else
at
the
trial
court
before
going
to
supreme
court
after
they
dismissal
or
the
ramification
of
the
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
didn't
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now
you're
going
to
talk
about
the
guilty
plea?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
was
march
the
9th.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
first
time
you
ever
used,
referred
in
anyway
to
the
federal
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
orally
presented
your
federal
(inaudible)
claim
in
argument
to
the
judge.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
record
at
page
12,
this
is
your
habeas
corpus
petition
in
the
supreme
court.
now
you
recite
there
at
paragraph
20
what
your
objections
where
in
trial
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
those
substantial
to
what
you
--
are
those
what
you
presented
in
the
trial
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
over
on
14
are
the
--
page
14
paragraph
26
are
the
grounds
which
you
presented
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
specifically.
justice
byron
r.
white
additional
ground?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
sounds
like
you
were
just
specifying
here
what
precise
grounds
you
want
ruled
on
in
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
there
is
some
difference
between
the
two.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
does
the
--
you
know
it
seems
to
me
this
is
rather
important
what
charge
he
was
--
he
plead
guilty
to,
if
plead
guilty
to
this
one,
isn't
this
a
state
statute,
the
state
vagrancy
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
city
statue
like
this,
city
ordinance
like
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
the
city
got
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
it
has
jurisdiction
–
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
a
transfer
of
the
same
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
only
thing
i
don't
follow
mr.
simon
--
i
though
you
indicated
--
you
made
a
motion
to
quash
the
information,
that's
never
been
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
that
information
still
extend,
is
that
still
outstanding?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
city
judge
do
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
–
then
why
would
you
nolle
prosequi
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
you
cancel
the
information
after
that,
i
mean
it's
all
--
you
don't
nolle
prosequi
information
to
somebody
who
has
served
his
sentence,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
ask
us
to
declare
the
regulatory
statute
constitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
--
for
violation
of
which
he
pleaded
guilty.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
the
problem
that
your
client
didn't
need
it.
this
is
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
and
the
function
of
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
is
to
be
freed
from
unlawful
custody,
and
this
man
is
not
in
custody,
that's
the
--
isn't
that
the
basic,
a
basic
problem.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
court
to
declare
to
release
you,
to
release
your
client
from
custody
because
of
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
louisiana
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
were
saying
that
was
one
of
your
ground,
that
you
were
being
–
your
client
was
being
detained,
his
detention
was
illegal
under
the
statute.
you
still
got
that
claim.
now
if
this
man
were
still
in
jail,
had
been
sentenced
to
jail
and
was
still
in
jail,
you
would
still
have
a
claim
that
he
was
being
detained
by
the
state
of
louisiana
under
an
unconstitutional
statue.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
fact
that
he
had
pleaded
guilty
and
then
convicted
would
have
changed
the
nature
of
your
claim,
was
it
the
illegal
detention.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
only
thing
that
really
makes
it
weak
here
is
i
suppose
the
fact
that
he
isn't
detained,
he
has
been
released,
he's
been
released
and
also
the
fact
that
there
maybe
some
real
questions
here
as
to
whether
you
adequately
raised
your
vagueness
argument
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
where
did
you
present
these
precise
grounds
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
page?
justice
byron
r.
white
sorry
the
rest
of
the
page
i
you
to
put
in
the
lower
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
rather
than
what
you
ask
the
supreme
court
to
pass
on
in
paragraph
26.
