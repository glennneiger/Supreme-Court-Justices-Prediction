mr.
j.
minos
simon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
louisiana
supreme
court
and
there
is
basically
involved
the
constitutionality
of
vagrancy
statute
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
i
suspect
that
a
succinct
statement
as
to
the
surrounding
facts
will
be
helpful
and
appreciative
of
the
full
import
of
the
question
before
the
court.
the
petitioner
is
an
illiterate
person
and
a
poor
person
and
in
april
1961
was
engaged
as
a
farm
laborer
by
a
resident
of
lafayette
parish,
louisiana
and
the
employer
in
question
happened
to
be
the
father
of
one
of
the
arresting
deputies
who
arrested
the
petitioner
on
the
charge
of
--
in
question.
the
agreement
for
or
rather
control
in
a
working
arrangement
was
that,
the
petitioner
was
to
be
paid
$4
a
day
for
his
services
and
to
be
provided
with
his
food
and
also
lodging,
the
lodging
consisting
of
a
small
building
approximately
8
by
10
in
which
he
was
permitted
to
reside.
the
employer
paid
the
petitioner
for
about
a
month
and
thereafter
discontinued
paying
his
wages.
the
petitioner
continued
to
ask
payment,
but
on
each
occasion
he
was
told
that
he
would
be
paid
later.
as
a
consequence
of
course
the
petitioner
was,
had
no
funds
with
which
to
leave
and
seek
out
other
employment
and
he
lived
in
virtual
peonage
for
approximately
eight
moths.
and
then
on
one
day
approximately
eight
months
after
the
initial
engagement
of
his
services
the
--
an
argument
arose
between
the
employer
and
petitioner
as
to
chores
to
be
performed
as
a
result
of
which
the
employer
told
him
to
leave
his
premises.
he
agreed
to
do
this
and
he
asked
permission
of
the
employer
to
leave
his
personal
belongings
in
this
little
one
room
shack
that
he
occupied,
his
small
amount
of
clothing
that
he
had
and
this
permission
was
granted.
and
he
took
leave
to
go
to
nevada
in
search
of
employment
where
one
of
his
sisters
lived
but
because
of
his
lack
of
skill
he
was
unable
to
obtain
employment
in
nevada
and
returned
lafayette
parish
and
on
his
return
however,
he
found
other
employment
on
a
farm
not
to
far
removed
from
his
previous
employment.
he
returned
to
his
shack
to
pick
up
his
meager
belongings
and
night
time
was
had
already
come
about
and
after
he
was
in
this
little
building
for
approximately
ten
minutes
he
heard
a
rap
at
the
door
and
upon
opening
the
door
there
were
four
deputies
from
the
sheriff's
office
there
to
arrest
him.
they
told
him
that
there
were
there
to
arrest
him
on
the
instruction
of
his
employer
on
a
ground
that
he
was
trespassing.
he
surrendered
himself
to
them
and
they
brought
him
to
parish
jail.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir
these
are
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir
he
is
a
full
time
deputy,
his
name
is
murphy
leon
and
the
employer's
name
is
i
think
nevis
leon
and
of
course
leon
son
was
there
with
one
of
the
arresting
officers.
when
he
arrived
there
they
rather
than
charge
him
with
trespassing
the
next
day
they
charged
him
with,
they
filed
an
affidavit
charging
him
with
being
a
vagrant.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
that
was
never
disclosed
your
honor
and
no
further
mention
was
made
of
that
fact.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
that
was
a
discussion
that
the
petitioner
overheard
between
the
arresting
officers
and
then
the
deputy
who
used
him
--
manager
of
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
minos
simon
as
i
recall
deputy
peacock
mentioned
to
one
of
the
four
arresting
officers
that
the
charge
of
trespass
would
not
lie.
he
didn't
given
his
reason
for
it
and
that
was
the
last
it
was
heard
of
trespass
charge
and
they
filed
a
charge
of
vagrancy.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
don't
know
your
honor
obviously
they
all
knew
why
he
was
there
and
i
doubt
you
could
convict
him
of
being
a
trespasser
because
he
was
there
with
the
permission
of
his
former
employee
at
(inaudible)
--
he
had
obtained
his
permission
to
leave
his
clothes
there
and
he
was
there
to
get
his
clothes
for
the
purpose
of
moving
away.
and
actually
the
charge
was
actually
filed
against
him
was
that
he
was
on
this
premises
without
being
able
to
account
for
his
presence
there.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
wouldn't
think
it's
too
substantially
different.
i
think
that
the
basic
difference
is
the
intention
of
going
up
on
another's
property
would
probably
the
trespass
charge,
whereas
this
here
obviously
(inaudible).
mr.
j.
minos
simon
if
the
initial
entry
is
with
consent
unless
there
is
a
specific
instruction
to
leave
then
of
course
it
will
not,
staying
will
not
constitute
the
trespassing.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
that's
substantially
yeah,
where
it
states,
yes
your
honor.
of
course
the
arresting
officers
are
quite
certain,
all
knew
why
he
was
there,
of
course
they
never
asked
him
to
explain,
he
didn't
know
that
he
was
arrested
for
being
a
vagrant
or
of
being
there
without
being
able
to
give
an
account
of
his
lawful
presence.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
no
sir,
there
was
no
accounting
asked
any
time,
in
fact
as
i
stated
the
only
thing
they
advised
him
of
was
the
fact
they
were
arresting
him
because
the
owner
wanted
him
to
arrest
him
for
trespassing
on
his
property.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
that
he
had
paid
the
services
of
counsel,
i
would
imagine
because
this
boy
can't
read
or
write.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
no,
no
yes
your
honor
no
question
about
that
and
if
there
has
been
an
error
in
that
on
that
particular
page
the
word
lawful
is
omitted
and
this
was
done
in
advertency.
your
honor
it
should
read,
without
being
able
to
account
for
their
lawful
presence
therein,
the
word
lawful
was
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir,
this
time
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
the
next,
it
was
not
filed
until
january
of
29th,
he
was
arrested
on
january
of
25th
but
the
--
signed
in
the
affidavit
not
a
deputy
and
the
officer
signed
the
affidavit
on
the
26th.
now,
then
this
charge
was
filed
with
the
clerk's
office
on
the
29th.
now
this
petitioner
was
not
brought
to
the
committing
magistrate
as
law
directs
that
he
be
brought
to
committing
magistrate
upon
being
arrested.
however,
the
charge
was
submitted
to
the
acting
sitting
judge
who
issued
a
warrant
for
his
arrest
even
though
he
was
already
arrested
of
course
but
in
the
warrant
itself
the
officers
were
ordered
to
bring
him
before
the
magistrate
or
before
the
acting
and
sitting
judge
and
this
was
never
done.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
now,
he
was
held
your
honor
for
a
period
of
four
months
actually.
he
was
held
without
being
able
to
use
a
telephone
or
call
a
counsel
from
january
of
25th
until
february
of
26.
he
made
several
efforts
to
--
he
asked
--
he
made
a
repeated
requests
to
use
a
telephone
they
refused
to
let
him
use
a
telephone.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
at
the
end
of
four
months
and
eight
days
there
was
a
guilty
plea
which
was
raised
by
the
opposition
here
in
their
motion
to
dismiss
because
the
question
before
the
court
is
moot.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
well,
i
was
going
to
get
into
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
can
do
so
now.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
in
any
event
i
think
the
history
of
this
thing
is
somewhat
important
it
sinuate
itself
significantly
the
question
before
the
court.
while
the
record
shows
that
a
motion
was
made
by
the
petitioner
for
a
bond.
that
is
incorrect.
he
never
made
any
motion
at
any
time.
he
never
had
counsel
till
february
26th,
sir.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
for
a
month.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
don't
know.
i
can
just
judge
from
what
he
told
me
which
is
contained
in
his
affidavit
he
had
asked
to
talk
to
two
or
three
other
lawyers
and
they
had
consistently
refused
to
let
him
use
the
telephone,
and
you
mentioned
my
name
and
then
let
him
use
it,
of
course
i
filed
a
suit
before
against
the
sheriff,
maybe
that
have
inspired
him
to
let
him
use
the
telephone.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir
on
the
26th,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
on
the
27th
i
filed
a
motion
for
habeas
corpus
and
in
the
alternative
for
preliminary
examination,
that's
a
procedural
vehicle
whereby
the
state
is
called
upon
to
show
probable
cause
for
holding
a
party
a
prisoner.
habeas
corpus
of
course
has
the
same
function
as
the
ordinary
habeas
corpus
anywhere
else.
in
response
to
that
--
of
course
the
judge
incidentally
granted
the
motion
and
fixed
a
hearing
on
habeas
corpus
on
march
the
8th
and
also
fixed
a
hearing
on
the
preliminary
examination
for
march
the
8th.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
this
is
district
judge,
no
sir
this
is
state
district
court
judge,
yes
sir.
now
when
march
8th
came
about
the
sheriff
in
response
to
the
habeas
corpus
when
the
case
was
called
up,
extracted
from
his
pocket
the
warrant
of
arrest.
now
of
course
under
the
clear
statute
of
our
state
title
15
section
134
his
response
must
be
in
writing.
however,
the
reasons
best
known
to
the
court,
the
court
accepted
this
as
a
response
and
immediately
upon
the
sheriff
producing
the
warrant
of
arrest
described
the
habeas
corpus
was
denied
without
granting
any
hearing
whatever
in
connection
with
it.
now
that
again
violates
the
statutory
laws
of
the
state
because
under
title
15,
section
134,
the
court
must
grant
a
full
and
fair
hearing
in
connection
with
the
habeas
corpus.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
sir
the
next
–
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i'm
getting
to
that
sir.
now
then
after
the
habeas
corpus
was
thus
dismissed,
then
the
assistant
district
attorney
arose
and
made
an
oral
motion
for
a
continuous.
now
without
--
the
state
(inaudible)
he
hadn't
been
served,
the
law
doesn't
require
that
he
be
served,
of
course
the
sheriff
had
been
served
with
all
the
papers
and
also
the
law
required
expressly
that
all
motions
for
continuous
must
be
in
writing.
the
judge
nevertheless
entertained
his
motion,
oral
motion
for
continuous
and
granted
it
until
the
next
day.
the
next
day
the
district
attorney
came
in
and
filed
for
the
first
time
a
bill
of
information.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
same
ground.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir
the
same
ground.
then
upon
the
basis
of
the
filing
of
this
bill
of
information
the
district
judge
did
not
deny
a
preliminary
examination
but
on
the
contrary
recalled
his
original
order
for
preliminary
examination
and
dismissed
the
entire
matter.
while
he
made
the
statement
that
he
was
not
informed,
that
the
petitioner
was
an
indigent
person,
in
fact
he
had
be
so
informed
and
the
record
shows
that
upon
the
making
of
the
bill
of
exception
to
his
ruling,
counsel
informed
the
court
that
as
heretofore
stated
petitioner
is
unable
is
post
bond
and
cannot
be
released
on
that
basis.
now
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
$50,
yes
sir.
and
we
applied
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
as
well
as
for
other
writs
before
the
state
supreme
court.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
this
is
an
original
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
this
is
a
writ
of
certiorari,
mandamus
and
prohibition.
it
might
sound
strange
to
combine
them
all
together,
but
it
has
been
a
ruling
of
our
supreme
court
that
where
you
request
some
affirmative
action,
even
though
embraced
by
the
certiorari
writ,
you
should
ask
for
mandamus
or
an
abundance
of
caution
we
asked.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
we
did
something
but
not
in
this
chronological
order.
we
applied
for
this
writ
of
review
and
also
for
habeas
corpus
before
the
state
supreme
court
and
that
was
denied
without
a
hearing,
the
court
simply
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
chronologically
in
the
state
supreme
court.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
we're
up
to
march,
yes
sir,
we
are
in
march
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
well
the
ruling
of
the
court
was
made
on
march
the
9th
and
on
march
13th
we
had
filed
our
writ
in
the
state
supreme
court.
on
march
16th
that
application
had
been
denied
by
the
state
supreme
court.
then
on
the
march
31st
we
filed
our
petition
before
this
court
in
1962,
and
petitioner
is
still
in
jail.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
now
then
thereafter
your
honor.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
no
sir.
in
april,
on
april
of
4th
of
1962
while
these
matters
were
pending,
the
case
had
never
been
fixed
for
trial,
even
though
apparently
we
were
ready
for
trial,
we
made
an
app
--
we
file
the
motion
to
quash.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
to
quash
the
information
and
that
was
taken
under
the
advisement
by
the
court
and
has
never
been
decided;
we've
never
received
the
decision
on
that.
then
on
may
the
3rd
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
that
the
act
i
believe
was
unconstitutional
and
with
no
probable
cause
as
i
recall
your
honor.
that
was
argued
and
submitted
to
the
court
and
no
decision
was
ever
rendered.
then
on
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir.
sir?
mr.
j.
minos
simon
we
asked
for
a
speedy
trial,
we
finally
--
it
was
obvious
that
the
criminal
term
had
gone
by,
was
practice
completed,
we
filed
a
formal
motion
for
a
speedy
trial
alleging
that
he
had
been
illegally
detained
and
except
on
may
the
3rd
in
1961
that
it
is
on
this
day
that
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir
justice
brennan.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
oh
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
at
the
time
that
we
took
exception
to
the
ruling
of
court
on
may
the
9th,
we
asserted
the
constitutional
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
well
that
was
after
the
order
that's
correct,
except
that
before
that
order
we
have
stated
there
was
no
support
either
in
law
or
fact
for
the
charge.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
your
honor
we
were
never
granted
a
hearing
whereby
would
have
raised
those
questions.
we
would
have
raised
those
questions.
we
intended
to
raise
those
questions
in
the
event
that
the
state
would
have
presented
any
facts
at
all
justifying
the
prosecution
of
the
petitioner,
but
you
must
recall
that
the
district
judge
never
granted
us
any
hearing
whatever,
whereby
where
we
could
have
raised
those
particular
questions,
in
other
words
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes,
but
that
was
made
on
april
4th,yes
your
honor.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
when
the
question
first
arose,
when
we
were
denied
of
any
rights
whatever,
during
oral
argument
we
presented
it
to
the
judge
and
then
at
the
(inaudible)
we
also
made
a
formal
exception
in
the
record.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
march
the
9th.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
it
specifically
other
than
to
state
that
there
was
no
support
in
law
or
fact
for
the
charge.
now
in
response
the
habeas
corpus,
the
party
is
supposed
is
set
for
the
basis
for
holding
this
party,
and
then
we
are
in
turn
entitled
to
adduce
any
evidence
or
present
any
reason
why
the
holding
is
illegal,
whether
it's
constitutional
grounds
or
otherwise,
we
couldn't
anticipate
what
the
basis
of
the
prosecution
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
in
argument
to
the
judge,
that's
correct
your
honor
and
then
after
the
ruling
of
the
court
where
he
denied
any
hearing
whatsoever,
we
pointed
out
--
we
took
our
bill
of
exception
and
raised
it.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
that's
correct,
as
my
memory
serves
me
your
honor
which
is
not
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
your
honor.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
my
law
partner
was
there
and
i'm
informed
that's
what
he
did,
no
record
was
made
of
that.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
additional
grounds,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
there
were
no
--
there
is
some
difference.
it
was
just
a
question
of
articulating
our
opposition
as
much
as
possible.
there
were
no
--
we
weren't
raising
--
we
were
raising
of
course
these
questions
because
necessarily
they
arouse
--
some
of
them
arouse
--
the
question
of
a
speedy
trial
for
example
would
necessarily
arise
after
the
denial
of
any
hearing
whatever,
and
a
refusal
of
the
court
to
grant
a
hearing
operates
to
deprive
(inaudible)
due
process,
that
would
necessarily
have
to
arise
after
the
district
court
hearing
your
honor.
then
of
course
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
sir?
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yeah
we're
in
may,
on
may
the
30th
your
honor
and
on
that
date
that's
when
we
finally
applied
formally
you
know
had
requesting
informally
from
time
to
time
to
find
out
when
the
case
was
coming
up
for
a
speedy
--
for
a
trial.
and
it
was
on
this
date
that
the
sheriff
went
to
our
client
while
he
was
in
jail
and
we
were
serving
without
compensation,
we
thought
the
fellow
was
in
pretty
bad
shape,
he
went
to
our
client
while
he
was
in
jail
and
he
asked
him
how
he
felt,
and
of
course
he
told
him
he
didn't
feel
too
well.
he
asked
him,
would
he
like
to
be
released
from
jail?
and
he
said,
he
certainly
would
like
to
be
released
from
jail.
so
he
told
him
that
if
he
pled
guilty
he
would
assure
him
of
his
immediate
freedom.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
the
sheriff
made
the
promise
and
he
asked
to
be
released
without
having
to
plead
to
anything
because
he
was
guilty
of
nothing.
the
sheriff
said
that
was
impossible,
so
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
was
--
record,
this
was
two
months
after
the
application
of
this
petition
was
before
this
court.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
was
not
consulted
at
all.
in
fact
the
petitioner
states
that
he
asked
to
call
me
on
the
telephone
and
they
refused
to
permit
him
to
do
so.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
that
he
was
brought
before
--
they
transferred
the
charge
from
the
state
district
court
to
the
city
court.
i
say
they,
i
mean
the
assistant
district
attorney
then
took
the
charge
from
the
parish
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
don't
know
exactly
just
how
he
did
this
except
that
i
think
he
filed
another
charge
before
the
city
court
rising
out
of
same
facts
or
circumstance
because
i
see
in
june
thereafter
he
dismisses
the
state
charge,
well
whatever
method
he
used,
i
really
can't
tell
your
honor
at
this
time.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
he
apparently
filed
a
new
charge
in
city
court,
i
would
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
the
identical
charge
rising
of
the
same
factual
situation.
apparently
couldn't
transfer
it
because
it
had
been
nolle
prosequi
in
the
district
court.
so
together,
the
assistant
district
attorney
together
with
the
sheriff,
took
our
client
out
of
jail
without
our
knowledge,
brought
him
to
city
court
and
then
had
him
enter
plea
of
guilty.
now
then
the
assistant
district
attorney
went
to
the
city
judge
and
told
–
recommended
to
the
city
judge
that
the
punishment
to
be
for
the
time
served
and
in
carrying
out
the
recommendation
of
the
assistant
district
attorney,
this
is
the
sentence
which
the
city
judge
imposed
upon
him,
time
served
–
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir.
he
plead
guilty
to
the
same
charge
your
honor.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
don't
know,
but
there
is
--
but
he
was
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
it
has
jurisdiction.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
it
has
jurisdiction.
but
this
--
as
i
recall,
this
was
the
identical
charge
that
was
filed
against
him
in
the
city
court.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir
your
honor.
it's
appended
to
our
supplemental
brief.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
well
the
charge,
i
don't
believe
that
the
charge
is,
but
the
affidavit
of
the
city
judge
as
to
what
transpired
is
appended
to
it,
which
is
substantially
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
your
honor.
here
is
what
the
city
judge
states
your
honor.
he
states
that
the
charges
were
transferred
from
the
docket
of
the
15th
district
court
and
for
the
parish
of
lafayette,
louisiana.
one
charge
was
for
the
crime
of
vagrancy
and
the
second
charge
was
for
commission
of
an
act
of
simple
battery.
so
it
was
--
he
considered
it
a
transfer
even
though
the
original
charge
was
not
nolle
prosequi.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
transfer
of
the
same
charge.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
never
been
ruled
upon.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
it
has
dismissed
as
june
the
4th,
the
district
attorney
null
--
moved
for
the
nolle
prosequi.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
city
judge
entertained
the
plea
and
on
the
recommendation
of
the
assistant
district
attorney
imposed
a
sentence
that
was
equivalent
or
equal
to
the
time
he
had
spent
in
the
jail,
so
he
let
him
go.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
don't
know.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
your
honor
the
district
attorney
would
be
able
to
answer
that
question,
i
certainly
can't.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
it
was
the
same
charge
but
it
was
dismissed.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
a
different
court.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
suppose,
he
felt
that
he
was
--
on
the
minutes
of
the
court
that
should
be
somehow
disposed
off
and
that's
what
he
did.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
well,
your
honor
my
response
to
that
is
that
this
plea
of
guilty
was
procured
through
the
coercive
effect
of
an
illegal
detainment
or
detention
of
this
petitioner
and
that
it
was
procured
through
the
illegal
and
relentless
conduct
and
acts
of
state
officials.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
review
of
what,
justice
harlan?
mr.
j.
minos
simon
no
sir
we
did
not
enter
the
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
not
that
plea,
no
sir
your
honor.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
can
think
of
none.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
can
think
of
no
procedure.
my
position
to
this
your
honor
is
that
we'd
be
rewarding
the
state
officials
with
illegal
conduct.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
furthermore
your
honor,
in
my
judgment
a
plea
of
guilty
is
the
ultimate
confession
known
to
our
courts
and
under
upshaw
and
mcnab
decision
the
courts
have
held
that
under
these
circumstances
where
a
confession
is
procured
through
the
coercive
influence
or
illegal
detention
that
confession
is
an
absolute
nullity
and
cannot
be
used
against
it.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
oh
i
think
that
the
rights
not
to
be
illegally
detained
is
part
of
the
concept
of
our
liberty
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
where
one
is
induced
and
coerced
into
pleading
guilty
or
making
an
ultimate
confession
of
guilty
through
this
process
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
they
would
be
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
understand
you.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
it's
my
position
your
honor
that
the
plea
is
an
absolute
nullity
and
the
court
could
ignore
it
as
such
because
it
was
procured
contrary
to
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
petitioner
and
therefore
it
can't
operate
as
bar
to
review
the
basic
liberty
questions
presented
to
the
court.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
suspect
your
honor
that
at
anytime
the
party
could
file
an
action
to
secure
some
kind
of
an
injunction
to
erase
this
conviction
from
the
record
(inaudible)
illegally
procured
that
would
be
available
–-
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
have
never
done
it,
i
have
never
had
the
occasion
to
do
it.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
actually
your
honor
will
get
to
that
question
only
when
you
entertain
the
motion
to
dismiss
because
the
question
is
moot,
and
i
don't
that
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
the
constitutional
questions
were
raised
your
honor,
which
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
your
honor
the
illegal
detention
was
raised
up
to
the
point
of
march
the
9th,
they
were
raised,
that
he
was
denied
of
all
of
his
legal
rights,
the
night
of
the
hearing,
he
was
denied
of
the
right
to
be
brought
before
committing
magistrate,
he
was
denied
of
having
the
right
to
have
the
sheriff
respond
in
writing
to
his
writ,
he
was
denied
of
the
right
to
a
preliminary
examination
once
been
granted.
the
court
granted
a
relief
not
prayed
for
by
the
state
in
that
it
recalled
it's
order
of
preliminary
examination,
where
they
had
only
asked
the
hearing
be
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
well,
i
–
mr.
j.
minos
simon
precisely.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
indeed
your
honor,
that
is
my
--
and
i
might
say
this,
its
rare
that
you
are
going
to
ever
have
the
constitutionality
of
a
vagrancy
statute
presented
to
you
because
i
dare
say
there
are
very
few
people
who
will
remain
in
jail
under
these
circumstances
long
enough
to
give
you
the
opportunity
to
do
so.
in
fact
may
i
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
no,
not
necessarily.
we
--
the
basis
for
--
that
is
one
of
the
basis,
yes
your
honor,
of
course
we
applied
also
for
writ
of
review
in
which
we
attacked
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
and
that
question
is
basically
still
before
the
court.
in
my
judgment
perhaps
habeas
corpus
had
been
affected
by
his
release,
i'm
not
certain
that
it
has
but
we
also
prayed
for
relief
that
the
conviction
itself
be
erased
from
the
records
of
all
courts.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
in
my
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
was
looking
for
my
original
petition
to
the
court,
but
returning
to
the
question
of
his
plea,
i
think
that
the
state
supplies
this
court
with
enough
evidence
to
treat
the
plea
as
an
absolute
nullity.
for
example,
they
have
attached
the
affidavit
of
the
deputy
sheriff
mr.
clarence
tibado
in
which
he
outlines
what
transpired.
i
have
a
brief
quotation
from
it
at
page
three
of
my
supplemental
brief
your
honors.
now,
in
reciting
what
took
place,
this
deputy
sheriff
stated
that
the
accused
--
that
the
petitioner
had
called
my
office
for
purpose
of
talking
to
me
but
i
wasn't
there,
of
course
the
accused
denies
this,
he
says
he
called
my
office
after
he
had
entered
the
plea
because
they
wouldn't
let
him
use
the
telephone
before,
but
in
any
event
the
deputy
says,
quotes
the
language,
quotes
the
statement
that
the
petitioner
is
supposed
to
have
made
it
to
my
secretary,
“i
don't
know
who
he
talked
to
but
he
said,
“if
you
don't
do
something
about
it
today,
i
will
go
plea
guilty
because
i
cannot
stand
the
jail
no
more.
he
hung
up
the
phone
and
i
put
him
back
in
jail.”
now
this
is
absolute
proof
of
the
worst
type
of
coercion
that
any
state
official
may
exert
against
a
prisoner
and
any
confession
obtained
under
those
circumstance
certainly
should
not
be
given
the
dignity
and
validity
of
operation
to
bar
this
court
from
reviewing
questions
of
constitutional
law
which
was
probably
before
it
at
all
times
previous
to
that
time.
well,
it's
you
before
your
honor
in
connection
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
your
honor,
we
don't
ask
this
court
as
such
to
release
him
from
jail,
but
we
are
asking
this
court
to
pass
on
a
validity
of
the
initial
charges
that
was
filed
against
him
and
now
which
is
a
matter
of
public
record
and
in
connection
with
which
he
has
been
forced
to
enter
a
plea
of
guilty.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
that's
quite
true.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
there
is
no
question
that
the
charge
itself
has
been
dismissed
but
then
again
we
have
this
proposition,
is
this
court
going
to
be
hamstrung
by
the
conduct
of
state
official,
they
have
been
dismissed
because
now
the
state
has
found
it
propitious
to
dismiss
these
things,
after
the
state
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
in
fact
your
honors
granted
cert
in
february
of
1963.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
way
after
this.
but
the
issue
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
but
i
can't
convince
myself
that
the
act
of
noting
jurisdiction
or
not
is
material
in
relationship
to
the
basic
question
involved
and
that
is
that
here
state
officials
are
attempting
to
profit
by
their
absolutely
illegal
conduct
in
relationship
to
the
liberty
questions
involved
in
the
detention
of
this
prisoner.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
and
if
the
court
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir,
if
this
court
however
were
to
hold
that
this
plea
is
an
absolute
nullity
then
all
of
the
basic
questions
presented
originally
are
still
before
the
court.
it's
a
question
of
weather
or
not
–-
mr.
j.
minos
simon
well
then
of
course
we
are
talking
--
this
question
arises
only
in
connection
with
state's
motion
to
dismiss
because
it's
moot
and
it's
something
which
was
created
--
is
their
own
creation
and
it's
not
--
it
was
involved
in
the
time
the
application
was
filed
and
i
don't
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir,
one
of
the
–-
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
i
would.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
not
to
the
slightest
degree
your
honor.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
not
for
a
misdemeanor,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
but
he
has
a
criminal
record
which
i
think
this
court
certainly
could
reach
out
and
clear
this
for
him
without
him
having
to
go
through
another
procedure
to
bring
it
before
the
court.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir
they
concede.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
that's
--
which
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
which
incidentally
your
honor,
a
prosecution
from
misdemeanor
maybe
based
upon
an
affidavit,
you
don't
have
to
have
a
bill
of
information,
yes.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir,
and
i'm
glad
your
honor
mentioned
that
because
it
gives
raise
to
collateral
question,
and
it
points
up
the
fact
that
the
sole
reason
for
the
which
the
state
did
file
this
bill
of
information
was
an
attempt
to
defeat
petitioner's
right
to
preliminary
examination
and
this
particular
ground
was
used
by
the
trail
judge
to
deny,
preliminary
examination,
may
i
elaborate
further?
under
the
preliminary
examination
statute
before
the
filing
of
the
bill
of
information
either
the
state
or
the
accused
has
the
absolute
unconditional
right
to
a
preliminary
hearing
which
calls
upon
the
state
to
show
probable
cause
for
holding
--
detaining
a
person.
after
bill
of
information
or
indictment
has
been
filed
and
it
is
discretionary
with
the
court,
we
filed
this
application
before
the
charters,
before
the
bill
was
filed.
then
when
it
came
up
for
hearing
the
district
attorney
asked
for
a
continuous
to
the
next
date.
the
following
day
is
when
he
filed
the
bill
of
information
then
he
took
the
position
and
therefore
it
was
discretionary
and
the
judge
adopted
this
position
and
then
did
not
deny
a
preliminary
examination,
but
recalled
his
previous
order,
a
request
--
where
there
had
been
no
request
for
such
action
by
the
court.
so
i
just
thought
i'd
point
this
out.
then
should
the
court
want
me
to
go
into
the
constitutional
question,
i'd
be
very
happy
to,
which
we
have
raised
and
it
is
our
contention
that
this
statue
is
unconstitutional
for
two
basic
reasons,
one
is
that
it
is
so
vague
as
to
run
counter
to
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
also
that
it
denies
equal
protection.
now,
of
course
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
your
honor
there
is
no
subsection
eight.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
we
held
that
the
--
we
presented
to
the
court
i
think
in
paragraph
20
of
our
application
to
that
court.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
i
made
just
one
--
i'm
afraid
i'm
in
error
there
your
honor.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir
it
is.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
your
honor
for
the
reason
that
in
our
procedure
in
louisiana,
a
question
which
is
patent
on
the
face
of
the
record
maybe
raised
at
any
time.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
that's
quite
true.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
it'
a
final
order
insofar
as
it
finally
disposes
of
petitioner's
right
to
habeas
corpus.
it
finally
disposes
of
petitioner's
right
to
preliminary
examination
and
it
finally
disposes
of
his
right
not
to
be
prosecuted
on
an
absolutely
illegal
statue.
and
those
are
--
all
which
of
in
my
judgment
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
then
i'm
afraid
i
can't
answer
the
question
otherwise
your
honor.
but
it
is
final
insofar
as
our
judgment
of
the
case
is
concerned
because
it
didn't
appraise
of
these
constitutional
rights.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
we've
all
--
in
our
prayers
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
we
expressly
ask
for
that
particular
remedy,
but
in
my
judgment
your
honor
the
statute
is
void
for
vagueness
and
i
started
to
point
out
while
vagrancy
prosecutions
in
themselves
are
not
serious
offenses,
they
become
a
major
crime
when
the
court
considers
that
the
use
of
this
statute
is
very
widespread
throughout
the
nation
and
it
constitutes
a
very
serious
abuse
in
our
judgment
on
the
liberty
of
rights
of
citizens.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
that's
a
species
of
vagrancy
statute
your
honor.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
it
sounds
like
that,
but
you
don't
--
the
difference
is,
and
that's
where
you
equality
clause
comes
in,
the
difference
is
there
is
nothing
intrinsically
criminal
in
what
you
are
doing
and
they
charge
you
and
prosecute
you
and
punish
you
for
the
status
you
occupy.
there
is
nothing
inherently
criminal
about
just
being
there.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
but
the
charge
usually
is
for
what
he
has
been
guilty,
the
conduct
for
which
he
has
been
guilty.
this
charge
does
not
relate
to
conduct.
if
he
is
there,
then
they
coupled
this
with
not
being
able
to
account
for
his
lawful
presence
therein.
this
is
what
is
offensive
which
is
not
an
act
of
conduct
as
such,
but
rather
a
punishment
for
the
status
which
you
occupy,
and
it
is
vague
if
your
honors
please
for
the
reason
that
the
language
itself,
the
terms
employed
are
too
general,
there
are
no
standards
by
which
you
can
determine
the
meaning
without
being
able
to
account.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
yes.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
he
could
be.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
well
who
determines
what
is
the
proper
accounting,
that's
the
point.
there
are
no
standards.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
but
the
statue
doesn't
say
that
you
have
to
show
--
mr.
j.
minos
simon
well
for
example
if
the
judge
doesn't
feel
that
you
have
given
the
satisfactory
accounting,
then
of
course
you
would
be
guilty
of
it.
it
calls
upon
you
to
affirmatively
take
a
position
and
explain
your
conduct,
which
embraces
another
question
which
i
raise
in
this
connection,
that
is
that
it
calls
upon
an
accused
to
affirmatively
state
why
is
there
and
if
he
does
not
do
that
then
of
course
he
has
failed
to
account
for
his
lawful
presence,
thus
he
is
deprived
of
invoking
the
fifth
amendment
should
he
decide
to
do
so.
and
of
course
this
is
a
right
which
is
common
to
all
persons
charged
with
crime
in
the
state
of
louisiana
and
to
that
extent
and
of
course
he
would
be
deprived
of
a
constitutional
right
and
he
would
be
deprived
of
equal
protection.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
that's
correct.
you
could
extend
this
further.
suppose
that
hannah
is
on
property
of
another
and
they
stop
him
and
he
says,
well
the
reason
i'm
here
and
i'm
looking
for
my
homes,
now
is
that
illegal?
you're
not
charged
of
trespassing
or
a
beggar
might
be
vague.
he
might
say
he
wants
to
eat
something
or
an
artist
might
be
vague,
he
may
want
to
capture
the
scenery
on
canvass,
suppose
he
gives
that
accounting
to
whoever
arrests
him,
is
that
a
satisfactory
accounting?
there
is
no
way
by
which
we
make
that
determination.
now
time
then
becomes
important
also.
should
the
same
reason,
should
the
same
accounting
be
given,
say
at
5
o'clock
in
the
afternoon,
is
that
reasonable?
if
it's
given
at
12
o'clock
at
night
or
2
o'clock
in
the
morning,
does
it
become
unlawful
and
why
does
it
become
unlawful?
there
are
no
standards
by
which
a
judgment
as
those
things
may
be
made.
there
are
no
standards
by
which
the
courts
may
be
guided
in
this
interpretation
of
this
particular
statute
and
so
the
citizen
is
left
in
the
precarious
position
of
having
to
speculate
as
to
what
the
statute
does
mean
and
what
is
does
not
mean
and
he
must
speculate
it
at
the
peril
of
his
liberty.
and
i
think
repeatedly
this
court
has
held
that
such
a
statute
when
so
vague
is
absolutely
unconstitutional
is
depriving
party
of
due
process.
now
also
i
might
state
that
the
classification
itself,
the
theory
behind
the
vagrancy
statute
your
honor
is
that
part
is
found
in
this
type
of
situation
or
not
doing
anything
intrinsically
criminal
but
because
of
a
status
they
occupy
or
the
mode
of
existence
which
they
pursue,
they
create
a
ferment
that
the
breach
undefined
crimes
and
therefore
they
should
be
punished.
well
we
submit
that
the
classification
itself
is
unreasonable,
it's
discrimination
that
is
not
reasonably
related
to
the
purpose
of
the
statue
because
there
is
evidence
to
demonstrate
that
the
theory
correct
and
therefore
yes.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
justice
black.
yes
sir
i'll
reserve
remainder
of
my
time
your
honors
for
rebuttal
unless
the
court
should
have
questions
for
me.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
mr.
chief
justice
we
likewise
submit
the
case,
i
think
it
have
been
thoroughly
discussed
unless
the
court
should
have
questions
to
ask.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
thank
you.
mr.
j.
minos
simon
thank
you
sir,
i
feel
it's
nothing
but
our
responsibility
your
honor.
