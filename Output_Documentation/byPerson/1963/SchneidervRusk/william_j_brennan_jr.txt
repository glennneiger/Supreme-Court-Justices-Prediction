justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
they
do
between
those
ages
then
for
life
they
retain
their
citizenship?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
you
say
mr.
freeman
whether
she
might
obtain
a
german
citizenship
again?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although
she
was
german
born.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
american
national
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
she
may
(inaudible)
get
again
a
german
citizenship
is
what
really
have
to
take
care
of
a
citizenship,
possible
american
citizenship
of
these
two
native
born
children?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
i'm
speaking
practically.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
she
could
come
into
the
united
states
(inaudible)
could
she
not
with
children.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i'm
wondering
but
not
really.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
other
issues,
other
rights
to
stay
here
but
perhaps
two
(inaudible)
children
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
she
came
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
of
course
they
don't
lose.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
only
a
naturalized
american
girl.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
freeman,
in
any
event
i
gather
to
the
extent
that
you
say
you
accept
perez,
you
accept
perez
as
you've
just
told
us
you
read
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
dangerous.[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
couldn't
possibly
read
it
that
way
that's
(inaudible)
–-
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
turning
on
the
distinction
of
ascribing
the
particular
conduct
thereby
is
something
which
will
in
effect
were
annunciated
in
allegiance
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
that's
right
–-
that's
right
–
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
same
experiment
that
--
what
this
record
demonstrates
is
that
the
only
reason
for
this
provision
was
administrative
convenience.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
to
say
it's
not
a
sufficient
--
it
doesn't
set
up
a
rationale
connection
with
anything,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
get
that
mr.
terris,
history
this
bill
referred
to
selling
out
that
the
presumption
didn't
work
because
they
didn't
even
arrest
or
whatever
it
was,
embarrassment,
indicate
what
the
embarrassment
were
the
facts
that
suffered
under
the
presumption.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
poland
made
no
distinction
between
the
american
naturalized
and
the
american
native
born.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
this
agreement
leading
to
the
(inaudible)
was
that
it's
only
administrative
convenience
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
obviously
is
not
at
the
time
but
were
actual
embarrassment
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
the
presumption,
it
was
approved
to
some
workability
and
therefore
trying
to
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
the
government
be
defending
the
statute
constitutionally
if
there
were
absolutely
nothing
except
that
it
was
easier
to
do
it
with
the
definite
rule
and
with
a
presumption.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
the
old
(inaudible)
that
consul
withheld
--
there
used
to
be
statutes
which
if
you
remained
abroad
for
a
period
but
within
that
time
you
went
for
a
consul
and
said
i
retain
my
american
citizenship
that
--
you
retain
it,
what
was,
what
was
wrong
with
that
approach
rather
than
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
would
say
congress
has
already
done
that
and
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
made
a
distinction
that
between
naturalized
--
if
you
go
back
to
the
place
of
your
birth
as
i
understand
it's
three
years
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
don't
come
back
within
three
years
you
lose
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
don't
come
back
to
the
place
of
your
birth
go
to
some
other
nation
you
have
in
five
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
there
is
a
distinction
that
congress
has
already
drawn.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
is
the
reason
for
that,
is
that
if
an
american
naturalized
citizens
goes
to
some
other
nation
outside
of
his
birth
he
is
not
as
much
of
a
problem
or
nor
perhaps
any
problem.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see,
it
become
citizen
of
a
third
nation,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
in
germany
of
naturalized
american,
he
now
goes
to
switzerland.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
the
problem
is
for
this
country,
if
the
naturalized
american
citizen
born
in
germany
goes
to
live
in
switzerland
or
the
philippines
or
somewhere
else.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
five
year
provision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
you'd
say
a
fortiori
you
couldn't
find
it
as
to
native
born
american
foreign
relations.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
ground
on
which
you
say
this
clarification
is
reasonable.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
been
that
on
the
average
since
1940
or
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
long
it
been
running
about,
70
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
many
nations
were
party
to
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
that
he
has
a
distinction
of
giving
these
names
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
far
back?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
1868?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
wonder
(inaudible)
[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
naturalized
and
native
born.
