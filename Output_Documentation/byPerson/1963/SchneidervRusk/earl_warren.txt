mr.
freeman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
freeman
where
do
we
find
those
exemptions?
are
they
in
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
would
have
been
the
consequence
mr.
freeman
if
it
was
not
extended?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
recognize
the
rule
in
perez
as
been
the
rule
why
this
case
should
be
decided,
or
you
only
distinguish
it
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
do
you
agree
with
the
rule
in
perez?
do
you
think
that's
the
rule
that
this
case
should
be
decided
by
or
rely
on
the
distinction
between
the
facts
of
this
case
and
the
facts
of
that
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
your
cased
decided
under
the
perez
rule?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
are
agreeable
to
having
this
case
decided
under
the
perez
rule?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
terris.
chief
justice
earl
warren
perhaps
i
will
ask
in
regard
to
mr.
justice
white
question,
doesn't
this
act
give
the
secretary
of
state
most
unlimited
discretion
to
determine
who
can
go
to
--
to
the
country
of
his
birth
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
that
this
section
352
a
which
says
that
this
is
not
applicable
as
to
certain
persons,
it
says
that
not
applicable
to
any
person
who
is
veteran
of
the
spanish
american
war,
world
war
i
or
world
war
ii.
i
am
reading
from
79
of
the
brief
for
the
appellant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
any
veteran
of
spanish
american
war,
world
war
i
and
world
war
ii,
or
the
korean
hostilities
having
served
in
army
on
an
active
duty
status
so
forth
it's
a
very
long,
long
section
and
then,
then
it
says
or
who
has
established
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
secretary
of
state
as
evidenced
by
possession
of
a
valid
unexpired
united
states
passport
or
other
valid
document,
that
he
is
temporarily
outside
of
the
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
(a)
carrying
on
a
commercial
enterprise
which
in
the
opinion
of
the
secretary
of
the
state
will
directly
and
substantially
benefit
american
trade
or
commerce,
or
(b)
any
scientific
research
and
so
forth
or
(c)
engaging
in
such
work
or
activities
under
such
unique
and
unusual
circumstances
as
maybe
determined
by
the
secretary
of
state
to
be
directly
and
substantially
beneficial
to
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
now
i
can
imagine
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
is
that
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
in
this
same
area
that
we
are
talking
about,
it
does
put
them,
does
give
a
very
(inaudible)
instruction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
isn't
it
discriminatory
if
you
do
let
veterans
live
abroad
that
way
or
if
you
do
let
anybody
whom
the
secretary
of
state
thinks
is
furthering
the
interest
of
the
united
states
or
that
he
thinks
he
is
engaging
in
an
appropriate
business
or
professional
activity
abroad.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
is
nothing
to
do
with
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
probably
we
wait
for
mr.
freeman
to
answer,
then
he
would
give
us
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
terris,
are
there
any
exceptions
or
exemptions
to
this
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
i
find
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that's
what
i
was
reading,
what
i
read
to
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
reading
on
page
78.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah,
all
the
rest
of
them
are
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
the
top
of
78,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
waste
anymore
of
your
time
i'll
read
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
mr.
terris
on
the
question
of
how
much
effect
we
should
give
to
the
concern
of
congress
over
the
effect
of
living
in
another
country
might
have
on
people
who
were
born
in
that
country.
i
remember
that
in
the
election
case
we
had
i
think
it
was
the
parish
case
here
to
go,
we
discovered
that
in
this
country
aliens
were
permitted
even
to
vote
for
president
of
the
united
states
for
all
that
100
years,
if
you
say
there
that
might
concern
not
only
up
to
1907
but
for
20
years
after
that
they
voted,
voted
for
president
of
the
united
states
here
without
regard
to
what
their
loyalties
were,
they
were
here
and
they
were
permitted
to
vote.
now
those
seems
don't
seems
very
consistent,
doesn't
it,
if
that
is
the
--
if
that
is
the
main
purpose
of
this
statute.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
they
don't
--
if
they
don't
want
the
foreign
influence
as
to,
to
be
brought
to
bear
on
our
people
and
our
government
and
it
has
been
concerning
them
for
100
years
it
seems
a
little
strange
to
me
that
we
would
permit
foreigners
to
come
over
here
and
vote
for
president
of
the
united
states.
chief
justice
earl
warren
right
i
understood
you
to
say
that
living
over
there
could
cause
them
to
accept
the
home
ways,
the
old
home
ways
again
and
affect
their
loyalty
in
an
adverse
way
and
that
that
was
the
thing
that
it
caused
them
for
a
100
years
to
be
concerned
about
naturalized
citizen
living
abroad.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
point
is,
as
i'm
concerned
over
and
some
jurisdiction
it
seems
to
me
over
election
for
president
of
the
united
states.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right,
i
agree
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
she
would
be
restored
for
citizenship
by
the
congress
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
by
a
special
bill?
chief
justice
earl
warren
make
this
by
special
bill.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
is
it
within
the
power,
the
congress
to
say
we
will
declare
all
persons
who
live
abroad
for
a
certain
time
to
be
expatriated
except
those
who
might
choose
in
our
wisdom
no
standards
of
any
kind
to
restore
to
citizenship,
if
that's
what
we
want?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
--
it
goes
pretty
deep
too,
when
you
take
a
man's
citizenship
even
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
have
a
friend
in
congress
you
can
get
a
special
bill
this
time
through
and
nobody
cares
very
much
about
it
and
they
don't
fight
these
kind
of
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
a
person
with
no
friends
or
no
money
can't
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
said
that
congress
didn't
do
this
as
a
prosecutor
if
there
was
no
penal
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
behind
this.
chief
justice
earl
warren
basically
is
it
foreign
relations
to
take
american
citizenship
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
that
when
she
was
married
she
deliberately
made
that
choice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
know
what
her
purpose
was
when
she
was
married
as
to
whether
they
--
whether
she
or
either
of
them
would
live
–
continue
to
live
in
germany?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
she
is
going
to
stay
with
her
husband,
that's
the
only
reason,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
freeman,
would
you
mind
at
the
outset
telling
me
what
relevance
this
section
353
that
you
quote
in
your
brief
has
to
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
what
i
want
to
know
is
this,
does
this
section
of
354
have
any
direct
bearing
on
this
case,
that
portion
of
the
sub
division
one
which
says
engaging
in
such
work
or
activities
under
such
unique
or
unusual
circumstances
as
maybe
determined
by
the
secretary
of
state
to
be
directly
and
substantially
beneficial
to
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
chief
justice
earl
warren
three
years?
