mr.
milton
v.
freeman
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
a
statutory
three-judge
court,
sustaining
the
validity
of
section
of
321,
352
a1
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
that
court
granted
a
judgment
on
the
pleadings,
dismissing
the
complaint.
the
issue
is
the
deprivation
of
the
appellant's
citizenship
under
the
mccarran
act,
the
1952
act
mentioned.
it's
a
new
statute,
involving
1952
reaffirmation
of
a
statute
passed
in
1940.
it
is
the
sole
substantive
discrimination
against
naturalized
citizens
in
the
entire
history
of
the
united
states.
it
removes
the
appellant's
citizenship
because
she
is
living
abroad
with
her
husband
who
is
not
an
american
citizen.
this
is
an
act
for
which
citizenship
is
not
removed
from
native-born
citizens.
we
assert
here
that
the
statute
is
invalid
for
discrimination
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
on
various
other
grounds.
the
statute
section
352
a1
and
a2
companion
section
are
part
of
a
statutory
scheme,
which
have
a
conclusive
and
automatic
termination
of
citizenship.
they
provide,
in
a
statute
which
applies
not
to
native-born
citizens
but
only
to
naturalized
citizens,
that
a
naturalized
citizen
who
resides
for
three
years
in
the
country
of
origin
or
for
five
years
in
any
other
country,
automatically
loses
citizenship.
this
provision
as
stated
before
does
not
apply
to
native-born
citizens.
there
are
a
number
of
exemptions
to
mitigate
the
harshness
of
this
rule.
those
exemptions
provide
that
in
certain
circumstances,
which
congress
has
provided
as
a
matter
of
grace,
a
naturalized
citizen
may
attain
the
same
right
to
live,
to
work
anywhere
else
in
the
world
that
he
or
she
would
have
had
if
born
in
the
united
states.
that
is,
it
takes
the
second
class
citizen
and
says
if
he
had
behaved
himself
well
he
will
get
the
same
rights
as
the
born
citizens.
thus
if
he
has
fought
in
the
armies
of
the
united
states
during
war
time
he
then
receives,
as
a
special
reward
from
congress,
the
privilege
to
be
treated
as
though
he
were
a
native-born
citizen
and
the
privilege
to
live
abroad,
it
happens
in
this
case
that
he
may
live
abroad
only
in
a
country
in
which
he
was
not
originally
a
citizen
and
no
matter
how
distinguished
his
service
or
how
many
awards,
he
may
not
live
in
the
country
from
which
he
came,
but
the
statute
nevertheless
awards
by
a
series
of
exemptions
for
special
good
conduct
or
special
circumstances
warranting
the
mercy
of
congress,
an
exemption
from
the
statute
and
persons
who
are
naturalized
citizens
living
aboard
may
not
be
expatriated
if
they
come
within
the
special
exemptions
who
are
generally
residents
abroad
for
three
years
in
the
country
of
origin
or
five
years
in
any
other
country,
automatically
cuts
off
by
this
statute
the
connection
of
that
person
with
the
united
states
and
he
or
she
is
deprived
of
citizenship.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
there
is
no
way
of
getting
a
dispensation;
the
only
way
that
it
has
been
done
in
case
of
hardship
is
of
course
by
special
legislative
bill
in
the
particular
case.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
they
are
in
the
law
and
they
are
printed
in
extenso
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
they
are
in
section
353
and
354
of
the
statute
and
they
appear
at
pages
76
and
following
pages
in
our
principle
brief.
now,
the
facts
of
this
case
are
enlightening
as
to
the
scope
of
the
statute.
angelika
shaffer,
as
she
was
then
called,
was
born
in
germany
in
the
year
1934
in
a
small
village
in
bavaria.
in
the
year
1939
she
came
with
her
mother,
her
father,
her
two
brothers,
a
half
brother
and
a
half
sister,
the
entire
family,
to
the
united
states
where
she
was
admitted
for
permanent
residence
with
her
whole
family
in
the
year
1939
when
she
was
not
quite
five
years
of
age.
in
the
year
1950
when
she
was
16
years
of
age,
she
was
duly
naturalized,
derivatively
through
the
naturalization
of
her
mother.
she
received
a
certificate
of
naturalization
shortly
thereafter
and
there
is
no
question
that
she
is
a
truly
naturalized
citizen,
naturalized
in
1950.
between
the
time
she
came
to
the
united
states
in
1939
and
the
time
she
was
naturalized
she
went
to
public
schools
in
the
neighborhood
of
new
york
city,
the
high
school
and
at
the
time
of
her
naturalization
in
december
1954,
in
1950
she
was
a
freshman
at
smith
college
in
northampton,
massachusetts.
she
duly
was
graduated
from
smith
college
in
the
year
1954.
then
a
new
york
institution,
the
new
york
institute
of
international
education
offered
her
a
scholarship
to
study
in
bern,
switzerland
at
the
university
of
bern.
at
the
time
all
her
relatives
were
not
only
residents
of
the
united
states,
but
american
citizens,
the
people
with
whom
she
came,
her
mother
and
father
since
being
dead.
mr.
kernic,
co-counsel
here
is
her
uncle
and
a
member
of
the
new
york
bar
on
the
occasion
of
her
leaving
to
study
in
switzerland
gave
a
farewell
party
for
her.
to
this
farewell
party
mr.
kernic
invited
a
young
man
he
had
just
met,
a
young
german
student
who
was
in
the
united
states
on
a
fullbright
research
scholarship.
he
was
studying
at
new
york
university,
he
was
working
with
the
new
york
trademark
firm
of
langner,
parry,
card
and
langner
and
mr.
kernic
thought
he
would
be
a
nice
fellow
to
invite.
it
turned
out
to
be
a
good
judgment.
angelika
shaffer
met
in
nutley,
new
jersey
her
future
husband.
at
that
time
he
was,
just
arrived
in
the
united
states
intended
to
stay
for
a
year,
she
was
studying
in
switzerland,
they
made
tentative
arrangements
that
they
might
meet
after
their
various
foreign
tours.
(inaudible)
she
went
to
bern
for
two
semesters
and
incidentally
her
only
connection
with
germany
since
the
time
that
she
had
come
here
with
her
family
in
1939
as
a
child
of
five
was
to
get
to
bern,
switzerland
she
had
to
go
through
germany.
she
did
not
stop.
after
her
two
semesters
at
bern
she
went
to
study
at
the
sorbonne.
from
bern,
switzerland
going
to
the
sorbonne
she
went
through
germany
again
and
on
this
occasion
she
met
dr.
schneider
who
had
returned
from
his
fullbright
year
in
the
united
states.
she
then
frequently
came
to
visit
mr.
schneider,
to
be
with
mr.
schneider
in
paris
and
while
she
was
student
at
sorbonne
they
became
engaged.
finishing
her
studies
then
she
came
back
to
the
united
states,
took
employment
and
lived
in
nutley,
new
jersey
with
her
uncle
until
a
marriage
date
was
set.
in
june
1956,
she
left
the
united
states
to
be
married,
on
july
4th
1956
in
cologne,
germany,
and
she
has
had
her
residence
in
germany
with
her
husband
ever
since.
she
has,
she
had
before
the
events
which
gave
rise
to
the
litigation,
two
children,
one
born
in
1957
and
the
other
in
1958.
in
the
year
1959,
the
government
of
united
states
through
it's
consulate
in
düsseldorf
stated
that
mrs.
schneider
was
expatriated
because
she
had
resided
for
three
years
in
germany,
interrupted
only
by
a
brief
visit
when
she
had
her
first
child,
she
came
back
to
the
united
states
to
show
up
her
first
born
to
her
family,
but
outside
of
that
she
had
resided
and
still
resides
continuously
in
cologne,
germany
where
her
husband
is
practicing
law
and
is
a
member
of
a
leading
law
firm
in
cologne.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
she
got
it
before
the
expiration.
what
they
did
was
they
gave
her
a
passport
for
a
short
period
of
time
and
then
immediately
advised
her
that
she
was
not
to
be
allowed
to
have
the
passport
extended.
they
kept
the
passport.
they
crossed
out
her
photograph
and
returned
it
to
her
as
valid
for
her
two
children
then
aged
two
and
one,
who
may
travel
as
american
citizens
being
american
citizens
as
the
children
of
an
american
citizen
at
the
time
they
were
born.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
she
could
not
have
obviated
because
the
definition
of
residence
which
is
set
forth
in
the
statute
means
the
place
of
usual
and
continuous
residence
and
does
not
mean
absolutely
continuous
and
uninterrupted
residence.
that
particular
possibility
was
foreseen
by
the
congress
and
foreclosed.
the
definition
of
residence
appears
on
page
four
of
our
brief.
it's
section
101
of
the
mccarran
act
and
it
says
“the
term
residence
means
the
place
of
general
abode.
the
place
of
general
abode
of
a
person
means
his
principal
actual
dwelling
in
fact
without
regard
to
intent.”
residence
shall
be
considered
continuous
for
the
purposes
of
section
350
and
352,
and
we
are
talking
about
352
here
of
this
title
where
there
is
a
continuity
of
stay
but
not
necessarily
an
uninterrupted
physical
presence
in
a
foreign
state
or
states
outside
the
united
states.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
yes,
in
order
to
avoid
the
operation
that
she
would
have
had
to
leave
her
husband
or
persuade
her
husband
to
give
up
his
law
practice
in
cologne
and
come
some
place
in
the
united
states.
now
--
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
no,
under
special
rules,
because
they
have
dual
nationality,
father
is
a
german
citizen,
the
children
derive
german
citizenship
through
their
father,
american
citizenship
through
their
mother
and
unless
they
spend
five
years
between
the
ages
i
believe
of
14
and
28
in
the
united
states.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
they
lose
their
citizenship.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
i
believe
so
your
honor.
now
when
the
passport
was
returned
to
her
with
her
name
stricken
out
and
only
her
children
left
in,
she
was
required
to
surrender
the
certificate
of
nationalization
which
was
given
to
her
in
the
year
1951
evidencing
her
naturalization.
in
1950,
she
surrendered
it
under
protest,
a
letter
from
mr.
kernic
to
the
effect
of
the
protest
is
in
the
record.
thereafter
she
was
served
with
a
certificate
of
the
loss
of
nationality
of
the
united
states
issued
by
the
state
department,
originally
issued
by
the
consulate
in
düsseldorf
and
affirmed
by
the
state
department
in
washington.
she
brought
these
proceedings
but
in
the
meanwhile
she
had
serious
problems.
so
long
as
she
was
an
american
citizen
with
an
american
passport
residing
in
germany
with
her
german
husband
she
had
no
problems
with
the
german
government.
once
her
passport
was
lifted,
she
was
then
a
stateless
person.
the
german
authorities
in
cologne
stated
that
as
a
stateless
person
she
had
no
right
to
remain
in
germany
and
was
required
by
german
law
to
be
expelled
as
a
stateless
person
without
any
right
to
remain
in
germany.
there
were
various
discussions,
representations
were
made
and
finally
after
much
difficulty
and
trouble
she
obtained
a
piece
of
paper
which
allows
her
to
remain
in
cologne
with
her
husband,
a
temporary
residence
permit
as
a
stateless
person
in
cologne.
this
piece
of
paper
maybe
extended
from
time-to-time
and
it
has
been
extended
to
this
date
and
it
maybe
extended.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
i
would
assume
that
she
would
be
expelled
from
germany,
and
she
would
have
no
place
to
go
because
the
government
of
the
united
states
would
not
allow
her
to
come
here
as
a
citizen.
she
might
apply
to
return
to
the
united
states
under
some
immigration
quota
if
one
were
available,
and
she
would
be
i
don't
know
what
quotas
we
have
for
stateless
persons.
now
she
has
travelled
and
she
has
been
able
to
travel
as
a
stateless
person,
of
course
as
a
stateless
person
before
she
leaves
germany
she
came
here
with
her
husband
in
1960
after
these
proceedings
were
begun,
she
came
as
a
stateless
person,
when
you
travel
as
a
stateless
person
--
before
she
left
germany
she
had
to
be
sure
that
when
she
came
back
germany
would
readmit
her,
get
a
stamp
on
the
piece
of
paper
which
would
be
permission
to
go
out
and
to
come
back.
she
had
to
get
permissions,
special
permission
from
the
united
states
government
which
is
not
otherwise
necessary
if
you
come
from
great
many
other
countries
to
come
to
the
united
states.
she
intends
to
come
here
again
in
june
which
is
the
10th
reunion
of
her
college
class.
she
has
two
subsequent
children,
children
born
after
the
beginning
of
these
proceedings
and
after
the
termination
of
her
citizenship
or
the
purported
termination
of
her
citizenship
and
these
two
children
have
a
citizenship
which
is
dependant
upon
the
outcome
of
this
case.
if
this
case
is
successful
they
are
like
their
brothers
dual
nationals
carrying
american
citizenship
under
the
conditions
we
have
mentioned
and
if
we
are
unsuccessful
they
are
only
german
nationals
and
they
do
not
have
the
same
rights
as
their
brothers.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
under
the
laws
of
germany
women
who
are
married
to
german
citizens
may
apply
for
and
receive
german
citizenship
by
a
process
of
naturalization
similar
to
ours
but
on
an
expedited
basis.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
she
was
german
born
but
she
lost
her
german
citizenship.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
--
when
she
became
an
american
national,
there's
some
discussion
in
the
government's
brief
that
it
tends
to
guess
it
out
on
that,
but
there
is
no
question
about
it
and
the
finding
of
the
court
below
is
that
she
is
stateless.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
no,
in
her
own
american
citizenship.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
practically
her
own
american
citizenship
is
the
vital
importance.
the
government
says
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
you,
whether
you
have
an
american
passport
and
it's
perfectly
alright
if
you
are
taking
german
--
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
only
on
special
permission.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
she
has
been
able
to
do
that
and
the
question
--
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
if
properly
admitted
as
an
alien
for
a
permanent
residence.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
well
it
might
or
might
not
your
honor,
she
has
two
children
who
--
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
no
the
other
--
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
well
i
think
basically
if
i
may
say
what
i
think
mr.
schneider
has
said
in
the
record,
i
put
that
question
to
her
and
why
do
you
want
to
be
an
american
citizen
if
you
are
not
going
to
live
here
and
you
are
going
to
live
with
your
husband
in
germany
and
she
says,
“i
wouldn't
feel
myself,
i
would
feel
silly
with
a
german
passport.”
now
she
has
restated
that
in
the
record
in
more
elegant
terms.
she
says,
“i
feel
myself
an
american,
america
is
the
only
country
that
i
have
any
devotion
to,
that
i
have
any
interest,
i
have
no
interest
in
germany,
i
will
live
with
my
husband
wherever
he
may
be.”
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
she
came
just
--
when
she
was
just
under
five,
so
she
came
here
as
a
child
of
five
and
she
has
spent
all
her
formative
years
in
the
united
states,
she
went
to
american
school,
she
is
an
american
girl.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
that's
right,
there
are
great
many.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
will
never
apply
for
it,
they
don't
want
it
anymore
than
mrs.
schneider
does
and
mrs.
schneider
has
of
course
every
opportunity
to
get
--
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
they
don't
lose
their
citizenship
because
--
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
it's
only
the
naturalized
american
girl
who
is
faced
with
this
choice
of
accepting
some
other
citizenship
that
she
doesn't
want
or
remaining
stateless.
now
mrs.
schneider
was
faced
with
that
choice.
she
said
one,
i
will
not
give
up
either
my
country
or
my
husband,
i
will
be
stateless
rather
than
except
german
citizenship,
because
german
citizenship,
i
cannot
consciously
take
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
german
government,
i
have
my
allegiance
exclusively
to
the
government
of
the
united
states.
the
fact
that
she
is
in
germany
is
an
accident
of
the
place
where
the
man
she
married
happens
to
live
and
to
practice
his
profession,
he
is
a
german
lawyer,
he
is
a
skilled
german
lawyer,
he
is
able
to
practice
his
profession
in
that
place,
he
cannot
any
place
else
and
she
should
not
be
forced
to
abandon
him
for
that
reason.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
cologne,
germany.
he
is
a
member
of
the
cologne
firm
whose
name,
the
name
is
in
the
record.
now
there
were
two
things
that
are
not
in
issue
in
this
case,
which
are
absolutely
clear.
the
two
things
that
are
not
in
issue
are
the
good
faith
of
the
nationalization
originally
in
her
actual
loyalty
to
the
united
states.
the
statute
makes
no
distinction.
it
takes
away
the
citizenship
of
a
person
who
was
naturalized
in
good
faith
and
accepted
citizenship
in
the
united
states
in
good
faith
and
it
applies
no
matter
how
much
after
the
naturalization
and
no
matter
how
long
after
and
under
what
different
circumstances
and
it
applies
independently
of
the
actual
loyalty
of
the
person
to
the
united
states.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
in
the
year
1950
when
angelika
schneider
as
a
freshman
at
smith
college
was
naturalized
that
she
had
no
idea
or
intention
of
marrying
d.d.
schneider
who
was
then
a
student
from
some
german
university,
she
met
him
only
10
years
later.
so
her
naturalization
was
accepted
wholeheartedly
and
without
any
condition
and
qualifications
and
it
is
not
subject
to
attack.
if
it
were
subject
to
attack
it
would
be
a
different
story,
there
are
many
grounds
for
attacking
naturalization
obtained
with
reservation
and
i
shall
come
to
those
later,
but
it's
perfectly
clear
her
naturalization
was
accepted
in
good
faith
and
if
he
intended
to
stay
in
the
united
states
and
complete
her
education
and
do
whatever
else
a
young
girl
would
do.
also,
not
in
issue
was
her
actual
loyalty
to
the
united
states.
she
has
proclaimed
it
in
her
affidavits
here
which
are
un-contradicted.
she
has
also
proven
it
by
the
fact
that
she
has
not
accepted
what
has
been
suggested,
it
is
an
easy
way,
why
don't
you
accept
some
other
citizenship,
german
citizenship
is
easy
to
obtain,
she
has
refused
it.
now,
both
the
government
and
the
majority
opinion
of
the
district
court
below
have
some
doubts
about
this
judgment,
for
the
majority
below
raises
a
question
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
mrs.
schneider
has
performed
any
of
the
duties
of
american
citizenship.
now
there
is
no
specification
of
what
duties
of
american
citizenship
she
was
supposed
to
have
performed.
there
is
no
indication
that
there
is
any
basis
any
charge.
the
statute
makes
this
irrelevant.
if
the
government
were
to
charge
that
mrs.
schneider
had
failed
in
any
responsibility
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
it
will
of
course
be
necessary
for
them
to
present
specifications
and
to
give
her
an
opportunity
to
meet
them.
we
asset
that
the
record
is
clear
that
she
has
met
every
obligation
of
an
american
citizen
and
that
there
is
no
obligationship
of
american
citizenship
which
cannot
be
imposed
upon
her
and
which
she
cannot
be
compelled
to
perform
merely
because
she
happens
to
be
residing
outside
the
physical
limits
of
the
united
states.
allegiance
to
the
united
states
is
not
something
which
requires
physical
presence
on
our
soil,
subjection
to
our
laws,
also
that's
not
required,
physical
presence
on
our
soil.
if
there
are
any
tax
obligations,
military
obligations
of
any
kind
they
may
of
course
be
imposed
on
american
citizens
residing
abroad
and
as
this
court
knows
from
the
facts
in
the
court
case,
we
have
a
induction
center
in
frankfurt,
germany.
now,
what
is
the
right
which
is
attacked
here?
what
has
the
government
done
because
mrs.
schneider
is
living
with
her
husband?
they
have
taken
away
her
right
to
be
a
citizen.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
elaborate
too
much
on
that
right.
this
court
has
talked
about
it
in
many
terms.
the
trop
case
held
that
taking
away
that
right
was
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
they
have
been
described
as
the
total
destruction
of
the
individual
status
in
organized
society.
it
has
pointed
out
as
the
questions
he
has
that
the
plaintiffs
very
existence
is
at
the
sufferance
of
the
country
which
she
happens
to
find
herself.
well,
any
country
may
(inaudible)
rights,
as
has
been
indicated,
no
country
needs
to
do
so,
because
she
is
stateless
and
it
has
been
characterized
as
a
truly
terrifying
remedy,
a
drastic
measure
and
the
statement
that
is
one
of
the
most
valuable
rights
and
has
grave
practical
consequences.
i
say,
every
member
of
this
court
has
associated
himself
with
some
or
all
of
those
remarks.
now
that
right
cannot
be
treated
we
say
the
way
a
right
of
lesser
consequence
can
be
treated.
the
court
below
thought
the
cafeteria
workers
case
against
mcelroy
was
relevant.
they
said
if
you
can
classify
between
various
people
and
say
these
people
can
come
work
in
the
cafeteria
in
the
navy
yard,
and
these
people
cannot
then
it's
alright
to
say
that
these
people
can
be
citizens
and
other
people
cannot.
we
say
that
whatever
the
conclusions
of
the
various
members
of
the
court
maybe
on
that
case
we
say
this
is
a
different
matter.
this
is
a
much
more
important
right.
it's
much
more
basic
and
it
is
not
subject
to
simple
classifications
to
say
that,
well,
naturalized
citizens
put
them
in
one
bin
and
classify
them
as
though
they
were
potatoes
or
well
we
were
dealing
with
a
right
of
a
lesser
consequence.
the
classification
here
also
as
i
shall
point
out
later
is
of
course
on
the
basis
of
origin
and
ancestry.
it
is
as
the
court
said,
classification
in
hirabayashi
which
is
odious
to
three
people.
we
say
that
whatever
the
circumstances
in
which
such
a
classification
maybe
apply
they
do
not
apply
here.
now,
we
say
that
the
power
over
citizenship,
the
right
to
take
away
citizenship
requires
some
action
which
is
related
allegiance
to
this
country.
we
say
you
cannot
take
away
citizenship
unless
the
person
in
question,
the
citizen
has
indicated
that
he
has
abandoned
his
allegiance
to
the
united
states.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
no
your
honor,
i
think
we
accept
perez,
we
accept
savorgnan
we
accept
perez.
we
say
that
it
does
not
depend
on
the
subjective
intent
exclusively.
we
accept
savorgnan.
we
say
that,
well
mrs.
savorgnan
said,
i
hereby
apply
to
be
a
subject
of
the
king
of
italy
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
could
say
we
don't
care
about
what
your
subjective
intent
was.
the
objective
effect
of
your
act
was
a
reputation
of
american
citizenship
and
acceptance
of
a
foreign
citizenship.
they
could
say
that
mrs.
mackenzie
whether
that
is
still
a
law
or
not,
when
you
under
the
state
of
the
law
at
that
time
become
a
british
subject
the
united
states
is
a
jealous
mistress,
we
will
not
share
your
loyalty
by
becoming
a
british
subject,
you
have
lost
your
american
citizenship.
in
perez,
the
majority
pointed
out
that
it
was
necessary
to
find
something
less
than
complete
and
unswerving
allegiance
to
the
united
states
and
elements
of
an
allegiance
in
some
measure
at
least
inconsistent
with
the
american
citizenship.
the
trop
case
emphasized
that
there
was
no
dilution
of
allegiance
in
that
case
and
if
your
honor
please
the
dissenters
in
the
mendoza
case
indicated
that
at
least
so
far
and
we
hope
it
will
remain
that
way
and
we
believe
the
constitution
so
requires
it,
and
i
quote,
“our
previous
decisions
involve
conduct
inconstant
with
undiluted
allegiance
to
this
country.”
and
when
the
four
dissenters
and
that's
part
of
the
provision
on
which
all
the
four
dissenting
justices
in
mendoza
agreed,
it's
not
part
of
the
separate
one
about
the
presumption,
that
when
those
four
dissenting
justices
said
that,
they
enunciated
true
doctrine,
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
citizenship
you
have
to
talk
about
allegiance.
that
citizenship
is
a
relationship
between
the
government
and
the
citizen
and
the
government
has
a
right
to
expect
allegiance
of
the
citizen
and
the
citizen
provided,
he
gives
allegiance,
is
entitled
to
membership
in
the
society.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
as
i
read
the
case
the
difference
between
the
members
of
this
court
in
perez
as
to
whether
this
act
of
voting
could
or
could
not
reasonably
be
regarded
as
giving
up
american
citizenship
and
involving
the
person
with
the
government
of
mexico.
in
other
words,
it's
the
same
problem
as
we
regard
perez
as
merely
an
extension
of
subordinate
as
a
case
in
which
this
court
said
the
majority
of
us
believes
that
the
act
of
voting
is
just
like
the
act
of
applying
to
become
a
citizen
of
another
country,
that
congress
could
reasonably
say
that
it
had
the
same
effect
and
that
it
does
affect
allegiance.
whereas
in
this
case
there
is
no
political
involvement,
no
basis
for
a
congressional
judgment
that
mrs.
schneider
for
the
vast
--
number
of
citizens
who
are
living
aboard
are
involved
with
foreign
powers
and
have
given
up
their
allegiance
to
the
country
of
which
they
are
citizens.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
well
i'm
not
sure
that
in
the
light
of
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
whether
the
court
reads
perez
the
way
i
do,
i
read
--
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
well
i
may
say
this
your
honor.
we
have
argued
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
perez
was
the
law.
if
perez
were
not
the
law
and
the
views
of
the
some
of
the
justices
in
that
case
were
to
be
accepted
of
course
this
would
be
a
very,
very
easy
case.
we
say
that
even
under
perez
this
is
an
--
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
pardon
me.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
well
no
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
i
can
do
that.
i'm
agreeable
to
having
case
decided
in
favor
of
my
client
in
anyway
that
this
court
will
agree
to
it.[laughter]
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
well
your
honor
makes
better
position
of
a
judge
than
i
am.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
well
–-
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
no
i'm
not
saying
that.
i'm
saying
that
perez
at
most
says
that
you
can
ascribe
to
this
punishment
or
this
consequence
of
loss
of
citizenship
only
through
conduct
which
is
inconsistent
with
american
citizenship,
which
dilutes
allegiance
and
i
say
that,
that
is
language
which
has
appeared
in
the
opinion
of
every
justices
of
this
court
and
since
there
seems
to
be
a
question
about
it,
i
would
like
to
read
again
if
i
may,
the
language
of
perez.
perez
says
it's
a
consequence
that
the
act
involved
here
involves
something
less
than
complete
and
unswerving
allegiance
to
united
states
and
elements
of
an
allegiance
to
another
country
in
some
measure
at
least
inconsistent
with
american
citizenship,
that's
mr.
justice
frankford's
opinion
in
perez.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
it
means
there
was
irrational
exercise
of
that
power
to
take
away
citizenship,
because
it
was
only
rational
to
take
away
citizenship
if
the
citizen
had
done
something
inconsistent
with
allegiance
with
the
united
states
and
consistent
with
allegiance.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
well
i
hope
you
will
--
pardon
me.
i
hope
your
honor
will
arrive
at
that
conclusion
and
i
say
citing
from
the
dissenters
in
mendoza
the
language
that
our
previous
decisions
involved
conduct
inconsistent
with
undiluted
allegiance
to
this
country,
so
that
i'm
saying
that
even
the
dissenters
in
mendoza
construed
perez
the
way
i'm
suggesting
it
should
be
construed.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
i
intend
to
your
honor,
right
now.
the
basis
upon
which
--
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
that's
absolutely
right
your
honor.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
that's
right
your
honor.
now
one
argument
that
is
made
here
and
the
basic
argument
of
the
government
that
they
have
been
driven
to
another
one
that
the
government
has
general
power
over
its
citizenry
as
an
inherent
matter,
i
think
that
doesn't
deserve
much
intension,
we
dispose
of
it
in
our
briefs
and
it's
inconsistent
with
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
other
denaturalization
cases.
but
the
argument
here
is
made
that
that
this
is
necessary
for
the
conduct
of
foreign
affairs
and
that
this
is
an
exercise
of
the
foreign
affairs
power.
now
if
you
look
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
act,
you
will
find
no
basis
for
it,
in
the
perez
case,
unlike
this,
there
was
an
actual
problem
which
was
presented
to
congress.
congressman
dickstein
was
very
much
exercised
over
the
fact
that
a
great
many
american
citizens
had
gone
to
germany
or
to
tsar
land
and
voted
in
the
(inaudible),
americans
of
german
origin
had
voted
in
the
(inaudible)
to
return
to
tsar
land
from
france
to
germany.
and
that
particular
foreign
affairs
problem
was
the
occasion
for
the
foreign
voting
provision
in
the
perez
case.
in
the
present
case
there
is
no
problem
of
foreign
affairs.
the
government
has
gone
back
to
try
except
in
the
sense
in
which
i
shall
talk
and
be
regarded
as
foreign
affairs,
the
government
has
gone
back
to
the
middle
of
the
last
century
to
try
to
try
to
show
that
there
are
problems,
that
there
were
problems
relating
to
the
impressments
of
american
citizens
by
foreign
countries.
the
fact
of
the
matter
of
course
was
as
their
own
brief
shows
that
all
of
these
problems
had
been
resolved
by
the
middle
of
the
19th
century
by
the
so-called
bank
bancroft
treaties.
the
government
of
the
united
states
had
fought
hard
to
obtain
for
its
naturalized
citizens
the
right
to
live
abroad
including
the
countries
from
which
they
originally
came.
they
--
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
well
that
is
another
example
of
the
point
that
i'm
about
to
make
that
this
statute
deals
not
with
military
impressments
because
military
impressment
is
something
that
arises
immediately
the
former
citizens
come
back,
comes
back
to
his
country,
they
don't
wait
two
or
three
or
four
years
and
congress
was
not
dealing
with
that
problem.
that
problem
was
generally
regulated
whatever
problems
there
might
be
with
tourists.
this
is
not
a
statute
that
deals
with
a
problem
of
the
tourists.
this
is
the
statute
that
deals
with
a
problem
if
any
of
the
long
time
residents
in
the
foreign
country.
now
what
happened
was
that
having
obtained
for
our
citizens,
naturalized
as
well
as
born
citizens,
the
right
to
reside
abroad
without
molestation
by
foreign
governments,
we
faced
another
problem.
it
is
in
fact
that
some
citizens
like
mrs.
schneider
retain
their
american
loyalty
and
that
some
citizens
when
they
go
either
to
the
land
from
which
they
came
or
to
another
land
or
born
citizens
decide
that
they
like
it
better
where
they
are
and
give
up
american
citizenship
in
fact
and
congress
and
the
state
department
were
very
much
concerned
with
that
problem.
and
that
was
the
problem
that
arose
after
the
turn
of
the
century
and
it
was
before
the
state
department
and
congress
in
1906
and
1907.
and
their
problem
was
what
shall
we
do
about
that?
we
do
not
believe
that
it's
appropriate
for
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
extend
protection
to
people
who
are
only,
as
they
stated,
nominal
citizens
and
people
who
are
really
turks
or
greeks
or
whatever
else
and
are
not
really
americans.
so
they
adopted
one
statute,
they
adopted
a
statute
in
1906.
now
from
the
beginning
of
our
republic
it
has
been
the
law
that
you
have
to
remain
in
the
united
states
five
years
before
you
are
naturalized.
so
that
anybody
who
is
naturalized
in
the
united
states
in
the
normal
case
has
invested
five
years
in
his
life
in
living
in
the
united
states.
in
1906,
to
avoid
a
possibility
that
somebody
might
come
here
for
five
years
and
then
go
away,
a
statute
was
adopted
which
provided
that
anybody
who
left
the
united
states
within
five
years
of
naturalization
would
have
to
explain
why
there
was
a
rebuttable
presumption
that
if
you
left
the
united
states
within
five
years
of
your
naturalization
that
you
had
intended
at
the
time
you
were
naturalized
not
to
stay
in
the
united
states
and
that
the
promises
you
made
at
that
time
were
false
and
that
your
naturalization
would
be
revoked
and
this
was
an
attack
on
false
naturalization.
this
court
in
the
luria
case
sustained
that
presumption
and
said
that's
fine
of
course
as
you
get
close
to
the
five
years,
you
have
to
have
more
conclusive
proof
but
this
is
an
individual
matter
and
as
a
presumption
it
will
stand.
so
that
now,
in
1906
when
that
statue
was
passed
it
was
clear
that
a
naturalized
citizen
at
least
was
pretty
well
taken
care
of,
he
had
five
years
that
he
had
to
invest
before
he
became
a
citizen
and
five
years
afterwards
where
his
naturalization
was
subject
to
question,
but
that
wasn't
only
question.
the
question
is
what
happens
if
you
have
somebody
who
has
been
a
citizen
for
a
long
time,
born
or
naturalized,
who
may
even
naturalize
here
and
lives
here
30
or
40
years
and
goes
away.
what
do
you
do
in
that
case?
now
the
state
department
thought
this
was
a
problem
which
applied
to
both
born
citizens
and
naturalized
citizens.
in
connection
with
the
statute
which
was
the
five
year
presumption
statute,
a
study
was
requested
by
the
state
department
and
the
state
department
suggested
a
rebuttable
presumption
applicable
to
both
born
and
naturalized
citizens
that
long
time
residents
aboard
should
be
the
subject
of
a
presumption
of
intention
to
give
a
citizenship
and
should
be
subject
to
rebuttal.
in
the
course
of
consideration
of
this
proposal
by
the
state
department
in
1907,
the
congress
--
the
statute
came
out
applicable
only
to
naturalized
citizens.
and
it
provided
that
a
naturalized
citizen
who
lives
two
years
in
the
country
of
his
origin
or
five
years
in
another
country,
should
be
presumed
to
have
lost
his
citizenship
and
that
this
was
rebuttable.
this
statute
was
construed,
one
as
not
taking
away
citizenship
but
only
as
governing
diplomatic
protection
although
the
language
seems
talking
in
terms
of
citizenship,
the
attorney
general
in
the
court
said,
“of
course
congress
was
considering
only
which
citizen
should
be
entitled
to
diplomatic
protection
and
not
actual
citizenship.”
in
addition
to
which
as
this
court
said
in
the
gay
case,
it
was
a
presumption
easily
rebuttable.
in
substance
it
was
a
census
provision.
we've
said
we
have
a
great
many
citizens
living
abroad
born
and
naturalized,
in
this
case
naturalized,
we
want
them
to
announce
themselves
every
so
often
as
to
whether
they
intend
to
remain
citizens
and
if
they
announce
themselves
--
in
the
gay
case
all
the
gentleman
had
to
do
was
to
appear
at
the
swiss
consulate
say
here
i
am
and
i
want
to
remain
an
american
citizen
and
that
was
it.
now
nothing
happened
from
1906
until
1941.
the
state
department
came
before
the
congress
and
said,
we
are
having
a
lot
of
trouble
with
these
cases.
we
present
you
13
typical
cases.
we
don't
know
how
to
decide
whether
a
fellow
is
or
is
not
entitled
to
diplomatic
protection.
it
involves
great
difficulties
and
we
wish
you
the
congress
would
relieve
of
these
responsibilities
and
adopt
an
absolute
rule,
an
absolute
rule
that
if
somebody
is
a
resident,
three
years
in
the
country
of
origin
or
five
years
in
another
country
and
he
is
a
naturalized
citizen,
he
loses
his
citizenship
absolutely
and
then
we
don't
have
to
bother
about
them
anymore.
they
said
we
know
that
of
course
we
can
make
determinations
in
individual
cases,
but
they
said,
if
we
make
determinations
in
individual
cases,
the
court
proceedings
that
will
be
burdensome,
cumbersome,
time
consuming
and
expensive.
and
we
want
you
the
congress
of
the
united
states
to
relieve
us
of
the
burden
and
expense
of
individual
determination.
and
the
congress
obliged.
we
say
that
the
congress
had
no
right
to
do
that,
that
the
constitution
prohibits
dealing
with
a
basic
right
like
citizenship.
on
a
basis
which
is
an
absolute
presumption,
the
presumption
in
fact
here
are
disloyalty,
of
lack
of
allegiance,
just
because
it
would
be
as
the
official
indicated
burdensome
and
expensive
for
them
to
find
out
whether
in
individual
cases
this
was
just
or
unjust
--
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
that's
right.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
that's
right,
your
honor,
that's
what
we
say
and
that's
what
judge
fahy
in
his
dissent
indicated.
it's
very
clear
and
the
actual
cases
before
the
congress
has
reasons
why
they
should
pass
this
statute
do
not
have
anything
to
do
with
any
problems
with
the
foreign
government,
they
created
no
problems
with
foreign
affairs.
the
only
problems
they
created
was
that
the
government
officials
would
have
to
sit
on
decide
these
questions
and
they
didn't
want
to
decide
whether
--
now
what
happened
--
another
thing
that
this
statute
did
in
1940
and
now
in
the
1952
act
it
not
only
made
presumption,
the
rebuttable
presumption
of
the
1970
statue
conclusive,
it
also
applied
not
just
a
diplomatic
protection
but
the
citizenship
so
that
if
as
some
of
the
13
cases
were,
a
citizen
who
is
subject
to
the
statute
and
excluded
by
wanted
to
come
back
to
the
united
states
he
could
not,
under
the
1907
statute
at
any
time
you
could
come
back.
but
this
statute
made
a
conclusive
presumption
and
said
you
could
never
come
back
except
as
any
foreigner.
now
we
say
that
you
can't
do
that
to
naturalized
citizens.
we
say
that
when
the
court
has
permitted
such
a
group
determination
of
disloyalty
it
was
only
under
extreme
war
time
conditions,
in
the
japanese
exclusion
case,
and
i
would
like
to
read
the
circumstances
under
which
that
was
justified
in
the
korematsu
case,
the
majority
court,
that
was
another
japanese
exclusion
case,
and
it
said
there
was
evidence
of
disloyalty
on
the
part
of
some.
the
military
authorities
considered
that
the
need
for
action
was
great
and
time
was
short.
now
there
is
no
such
situation
here.
time
is
not
short.
there
is
adequate
opportunity
for
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
make
individual
determinations.
there
is
no
imminent
threat
of
invasion.
military
authorities
are
not
involved,
and
we
say
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
must
give
individual
justice,
that
it
cannot
give
discriminatory
justice,
that
it
cannot
attribute
to
naturalize
citizens'
loyalty
or
disloyalty
to
the
united
states
which
it
does
not
attribute
to
born
citizens
in
similar
cases.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
yes
your
honor,
it
establishes
the
discrimination
between
born
and
naturalized
citizens,
by
showing
that
there
are
a
series
of
exemptions
which
are
in
the
nature
of
rewards
for
naturalized
citizens
and
if
they
come
within
them
by
good
conduct
of
some
kind
such
as
serving
in
our
armed
forces
or
pursing
some
activity
of
which
the
secretary
of
state
approves
in
his
discretion,
then
they
will
obtain
from
the
government
of
the
united
states
the
right
to
be
just
as
good
as
a
naturalized
citizen
and
if
they
don't
do
that
then
they
are
not
just
as
good
as
a
naturalized
citizen
and
they
don't
get
the
right
to
stay
either
in
the
country
of
their
origin
or
in
any
foreign
country.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
native
born
citizens,
that
they
get
the
rights
and
these
are
in
the
nature
of
rewards
for
naturalized
citizens
which
if
you
meet
these
exemptions
you
are
then
equated
with
a
born
citizen
in
your
rights
to
reside
abroad.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
that
provision
as
mr.
terris
said,
applies
to
people
who
reside
not
in
the
country
of
their
origin
and
it
says
they
--
if
the
secretary
of
state
says
i
approve
of
what
you
are
doing
then
you
may
reside
more
than
five
years
in
libya
or
wherever
else
if
you
didn't
come
from
libya
and
it
says
you
then
have
the
right,
let's
say
if
you
are
a
petroleum
engineer,
you
have
the
same
right
to
live
in
libya
for
ten
years
and
to
make
a
contract
that
a
born
american
citizen
has
without
the
permission
of
the
secretary
of
state,
there
are
no
discretionary
provisions
as
to
the
right
to
live
in
the
country
where
you
originally
came.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
but
as
to
those
there
are
exemptions
which
say
that
if
you
are
working
for
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
we
won't
take
your
citizenship
away
and
so
on,
if
you
reside
in
that
country
or
if
you
are
working
for
an
american
firm
but
you
may
not
take
an
offer
from
a
foreign
firm
if
you
are
living
there.
so
that
is
now
--
in
that
connection
i
would
like
to
put
the
relationship
of
these
two
statues,
mr.
terris
has
of
course
tried
to
limit
the
issue
to
only
the
statute
that
is
applicable
to
mrs.
schneider.
these
statutes
have
been
together
from
the
beginning.
the
fact
that
they
had
been
together
is
we
are
dealing
with
people
who
are
residing
not
only
in
the
country
of
their
origin,
but
in
other
countries,
shows
that
congress
was
not
concerned
with
the
nature
of
foreign
affairs
problem,
but
i
think
i
quote
mr.
terris
correctly
if
i
say
that
solicitors
of
this
country,
they
are
concerned
with
the
problem
of
retransfer
of
allegiance.
in
other
words,
this
is
a
kind
of
rough
attempt
by
the
congress
to
find
out
if
american
citizens
are
loyal
by
lumping
them
in
groups.
they
lump
naturalized
citizens
why
they
are
loyal
you
don't
have
to
check
on
them
and
born
citizens
you
don't
have
to
check
on
them,
they
are
loyal
of
course.
a
naturalized
citizen
is
suspect.
if
he
lives
abroad
for
five
years
in
another
country
then
the
one
he
came
from,
why
then
he
is
suspect,
if
he
goes
back
to
the
country
where
the
came
from
originally
no
matter
how
much
later,
why
he
is
suspect
in
a
shorter
period
of
time,
this
is
a
question
of
allegiance.
now
i
think
congress
has
the
right
to
deal
with
people
who
have
compromised
their
allegiance
in
some
way
by
some
act,
but
they
don't
have
the
right
to
do
it
on
the
basis
of
grouping
all
of
these
people
as
naturalized
citizens
and
saying
everybody
in
that
category
is
in
the
same
--
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
no
i
do
not
unless
it's
conditioned
on
something
relating
to
loyalty
that
can
be
applied
to
born
and
naturalized
citizen
alike.
i
think
that's
the
teaching
of
the
rulings
of
this
court
that
say
that
when
a
naturalized
citizen
becomes
a
citizen
he
is
taken
up
in
the
body
politics
with
all
the
rights
of
the
born
citizens
and
i
think
--
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
that's
the
only
distinction
which
is
permissible,
the
one
that
the
constitution
makes.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
well,
what
our
brief
shows,
our
reply
brief
show
that,
that
means
that
you
can
make
conditions
only
before
he
becomes
a
citizen
and
not
after
--
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
but
the
condition
should
not
apply
to
his
conduct
after
he
becomes
a
citizen,
that
is
once
he
is
naturalized
in
good
faith,
assuming
there
is
good
faith
naturalization
of
course,
then
he
is
the
same
as
a
born
citizen,
that's
what
the
constitution
means,
that's
what
the
history
of
the
debates
that
we
have
discussed
in
our
brief
and
in
our
brief
we
think
it
establishes
clearly
that
the
chief
justice
marshall
was
correct
and
the
other
decisions
of
this
court
were
also
correct.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
no
indeed
i
don't
think
you
can
have
two
classes
of
citizenship,
we
argued
that,
the
government
had
raised
--
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
yes
sir.
that
is
extensively
brief
your
honor
and
we
believe
that
there
is
no
right
to
condition
citizenship
and
require
one
class
of
citizens
is
something
that
you
do
not
require
of
another
class
of
citizens.
that's
i
think
the
most
basic
point
we
make.
now
there
are
a
few
little
things
i
would
like
to
pick
up
as
i've
noted.
now
mr.
terris
stated
with
respect
to
--
and
he
pays
great
attention
to
the
1906
citizenship
board
and
he
says
the
1907
statute
was
a
result
of
the
board's
recommendation.
now
what
he
omits
to
state
was
the
board
in
that
case
recommended
that
as
far
as
people
living
abroad
were
concerned
that
you
had
to
deal
with
born
and
naturalized
citizens
on
the
same
basis.
i
think
there's
an
interesting
and
more
detailed
history,
more
detailed
than
in
any
brief
that
is
filed
in
the
cornell
law
quarterly
we
have
cited
in
our
reply
brief
but
i
like
specifically
to
note
it,
49
cornell
law
quarterly
page
52,
it's
a
1963
decision.
now
as
far
as
the
bankcroft
treaties
which
were
mentioned,
i
think
one
thing
that's
consequential,
we've
mentioned
that
in
our
reply
brief
on
page
ten,
the
bancroft
don't
deal
with
taking
away
citizenship
at
all.
they
deal
with
diplomatic
protection.
it's
so
stated,
there
is
a
decision
of
the
immigration
naturalization
board,
the
state
department
itself
urges
it
before
the
international
court
of
justice
that
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
taking
away
citizenship
that
people
could
always
come
back,
it's
like
the
1907
statute,
it's
a
question
of
diplomatic
protection.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
they
cited
in
our
brief
on
page
10
of
our
reply
where
yes
they
discussed
the
main
reason
on
page
10
of
our
reply
brief
is
the
evidence
to
the
effect
--
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
well,
we
say
in
footnote
seven
on
page
ten
that
the
state
department
took
the
position
as
recently
as
1958
that's
what
they
meant
in
a
proceeding
before
an
italian
united
states
conciliation
commission.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
well,
i
don't
know
your
honor,
i
haven't
checked
that
recently.
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
not
at
he
moment,
your
honor.
now
as
far
as
the
subject
of
the
relevancy
of
the
aliens
voting
in
the
united
states
is
being
sufficiently
involved
in
our
citizenship
to
be
able
to
vote,
the
rules
that
we
are
applicable
which
were
mentioned
in
the
perez
case
said
that
united
states
citizens
who
--
i
mean
aliens
who
are
residing
in
the
united
states,
who
had
filed
an
intention
to
become
citizens
of
the
united
states
could
vote.
now
mr.
schneider
has
not
filed
any
intention
to
become
a
citizen
of
germany
and
has
no
evidence
as
they
were.
in
other
words
we
accepted
these
foreign
persons
as
entitled
to
be
involved
in
our
political
life
and
to
vote
before
1928
because
they
had
committed
themselves
to
become
united
states
citizens
and
so
declared
their
intention.
now
as
far
as
mrs.
schneider
status
of
course
she
is
stateless
the
government
moved
the
judgment
on
the
pleadings
on
a
complaint
was
said
she
was
stateless,
the
court
of
law
said
she
was
stateless,
i
have
the
greatest
respect
mr.
terris'
expertise
in
german
law,
but
no
point
was
made
of
that
below
and
it's
just
wrong,
our
experts
on
german
law
say
something
different,
the
case
is
here
on
a
clear
pleading,
mrs.
schneider
is
stateless
she
has
been
treated
as
stateless
by
the
german
government.
i
recited
to
your
honors
the
difficulty
she
has
had
in
even
obtaining
a
piece
of
paper
--
mr.
milton
v.
freeman
no
i
don't
believe
so,
but
it
would
be
--
it's
an
attempt
as
there
are
a
great
many
attempts
to
indicate
that
maybe
there
is
something
wrong
with
mrs.
schneider's
individual
loyalty,
although
there
--
it's
accompanied
with
repeated
statements
that
nothing
reprehensible
involved
and
there
is
nothing
involved
which
indicates
here
disloyalty,
but
we
arguing
about
retransferring
of
allegiance
and
we
say
that
can
be
done
only
by
individuals
non-discriminatory
determinations.
thank
you.
