mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
dispose
at
the
outset
of
the
appellant's
contention
which
counsel
did
not
reach
in
oral
argument
and
which
is
contained
in
our
brief,
that
this
case
is
governed
by
the
court's
decision
last
term
in
kennedy
versus
mendoza-martinez.
that
is
that
this
statute
is
a
penal
statute
and
therefore
it
violates
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
and
the
eighth
amendment.
the
short
answer
to
this
is
--
this
statute
is
not
a
penal
statute.
there
is
not
the
slightest
indication
of
a
legislative
history,
not
even
a
--
not
a
word
or
a
sentence
to
indicate
that
it
is
a
criminal
statute
or
that
it
was
intended
to
deter
or
to
have
retribution
or
to
have
any
of
the
other
attributes
of
a
criminal
statute
and
aside
from
the
legislative
history,
we
believe
that
it
is
unbelievable
to
think
that
congress
would
have
imposed
criminal
penalties
on
a
neutral
act
such
as
mere
residence
abroad
which
is
not
criminal
and
is
not
immoral
and
is
not
reprehensible
in
any
way.
i
would
now
like
to
turn
to
what
are
admittedly
the
serious
constitutional
questions
which
are
involved
in
this
case.
as
we
see
it
there
are
two.
first,
whether
congress
has
the
power
to
expatriate
american
citizens
because
of
prolonged
residence
in
the
country
of
their
origin
on
the
basis
of
congress'
power
over
foreign
affairs.
and
the
second
question
is
whether
it
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
insofar
as
this
principle
applies
to
the
federal
government
through
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment,
to
provide
that
expatriation
of
naturalized
citizens
without
providing
for
the
expatriation
of
native
born
citizens.
before
i
consider
the
legal
arguments
on
these
two
questions
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
history
underlined
section
352
(a)
(1).
to
be
frank
i
do
not
recognize
the
history
as
it
is
described
by
the
appellant's
counsel.
this
history
extends
back
to
english
common
law
and
i
think
it's
also
relevant
as
this
court
has
indicated
in
the
previous
case
to
look
to
the
experience
of
other
countries.
therefore
we'll
just
summarize
the
materials
which
are
described
in
considerable
greater
--
considerably
greater
detail
in
our
brief
and
which
even
the
brief
is
only
a
summary
of
the
really
overwhelming
evidence
that
foreign
problems,
foreign
affairs
problems
underlay
this
statute.
in
english
common
law,
a
citizen
had
no
right
to
renounce
his
citizenship
at
all.
this
was
the
so
called
principle
or
perpetual
allegiance,
but
this
principle
was
not
reciprocal.
not
only
were
conditions
often
placed
in
grants
of
citizenship,
but
england
had
statutes
which
provided
for
expatriation
for
various
conduct,
including
for
prolonged
residence
abroad.
now
these
principles
were
partially
refracted
in
the
american
constitution.
as
in
england,
the
political
rights
of
naturalized
citizens
are
limited
in
the
american
constitution.
no
naturalized
citizen
may
ever
be
president
of
the
united
states
and
he
may
not
sit
in
the
house
of
representatives
or
in
the
senate
for
seven
and
nine
years
respectively
after
naturalization.
while
madison
and
hamilton
opposed
these
provisions
at
the
constitutional
convention,
they
did
so
on
the
ground
that
the
provisions
were
unnecessary.
they
said,
in
madison's
words,
congress
has
the
right
of
regulating
naturalization
and
can
by
virtue
thereof
fix
different
periods
of
residence
as
conditions
of
enjoying
different
privileges
of
citizenship.
in
the
first
congress,
in
debate
on
whether
residence
should
be
required
prior
to
naturalization,
congressman
white
said
that
if
this
requirement
were
omitted
naturalized
citizens
should
be
expatriated
who
left
the
country
and
stayed
abroad
for
a
given
length
of
time.
when
another
congressman
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
this
proposal,
madison
responded
it
maybe
a
question
of
some
nicety,
how
far
we
can
make
our
law
to
admit
an
alien
to
the
right
of
citizenship
step-by-step,
but
there
is
no
doubt
we
may
and
ought
to
require
residence
as
an
essential,
and
despite
appellant's
contentions
to
the
contrary
in
a
reply
brief,
i
think
a
reading
by
this
court
of
that
entire
10
or
15-page
discussion
in
the
first
congress
will
show
that
madison
was
discussing
residence
after
naturalization.
in
the
conflict
between
the
hamiltonians
and
jeffersonians
in
the
1790s
over
the
right
of
citizens
to
renounce
their
citizenship,
the
jeffersonians
argued
that
immigration
and
resulting
residence
abroad
dissolved
the
ties
binding
a
citizen
to
his
government
and
when
this
issue
again
became
crucial
during
the
war
of
1812,
the
madison
administration
published
a
pamphlet
saying
that
immigration
with
intent
to
reside
abroad
permanently
ipso
facto
constituted
expatriation.
during
the
19th
century
a
new
problem
arose
in
this
area.
naturalized
citizens
residing
in
their
native
lands
became
sources
of
conflict
in
american
foreign
relations,
when
foreign
countries
treated
them
as
their
own
citizens
with
regard
to
military
service,
to
taxation,
to
political
loyalty
and
the
like.
as
a
result
despite
the
traditional
american
doctrine
of
extending
protection
to
natural
born
and
naturalized
citizens
alike,
the
department
of
state
as
early
as
1818
tried
to
meet
this
problem
by
refusing
to
give
protection
to
naturalized
citizens
domiciled
in
their
former
homelands.
after
the
civil
war
the
problem
became
even
more
acute,
as
pressure
began
to
conscript
american
citizens
into
it's
armies
and
england
charged
american
citizens
with
complicity
in
the
fenian
revolt
after
they
had
returned
to
their
native
ireland.
consequently
the
american
government
tried
three
new
methods
to
meet
this
problem.
first,
congress
in
1868
passed
a
statute
which
provided
that
naturalized
citizens
and
native
born
citizens
would
be
given
protection
and
the
like
in
the
hopes
that
foreign
countries
could
be
induced
not
to
make
demands
on
any
american
citizens.
also
in
1868
the
department
of
state
began
to
enter
into
the
so
called
bancroft
treaties,
which
provided
that
if
a
--
that
a
naturalize
citizen
was
expatriated,
if
he
returned
to
his
former
homeland
without
an
intent
to
return
to
his
adopted
country
and
that
an
intent
not
to
return
would
be
presumed
after
two
years
residence.
today
these
bancroft
treaties
are
enforced
with
21
different
nations,
not
including
germany,
although
one
--
the
first
treaty
was
with
germany
since
at
the
time
the
treaty
expired.
and
the
third
method
of
dealing
with
this
problem
was
that
late
in
the
19th
century
the
department
of
state
started
to
inform
naturalized
citizens
residing
in
their
native
lands
with
which
no
bancroft
treaty
existed
that
they
had
expatriated
themselves.
when
president
grant
pulled
his
cabinet
as
to
whether
naturalized
citizens
resided
in
their
native
countries
with
no
intent
to
return
to
this
country
had
expatriated
themselves,
a
majority
of
the
cabinet
answered
in
the
affirmative
including
secretary
of
state
fish,
and
this
principle
was
also
followed
by
several
international
mixed
claims
commissions.
as
this
court
described
the
situation
in
perez,
the
historical
situation
at
the
end
of
the
19th
century,
no
one
seems
to
have
questioned
the
necessity
of
having
the
department
of
state
pass
on
the
validity
of
claims
to
american
citizenship,
but
this
method
was
regarded
as
unsatisfactory
since
no
clear
standard
existed
and
expatriation
depended
on
executive
discretion.
consequently
demands
grew
for
congress
to
act.
as
early
as
1863,
president
lincoln
suggested
to
congress
that
it
fix
a
limit
beyond
which
no
citizen
of
the
united
states
residing
abroad
may
claim
the
interposition
of
the
government.
in
1874,
president
grant
told
congress
that
a
statute
defining
expatriation
was
necessary
because
the
representatives
of
the
united
states
in
foreign
countries
are
continually
called
upon
to
lend
their
aid
in
the
protection
of
the
united
states
to
persons
concerning
whose
citizenship
there
is
at
least
a
great
question.
however,
congress
did
not
act
promptly.
it
was
not
until
the
start
of
the
20th
century
the
congress
first
passed
legislation
in
this
field.
they
first
passed
in
1906,
the
statute
which
mr.
freedman
has
alluded
to
providing
for
--
providing
a
presumption
of
loss,
fraudulent
naturalization
for
leaving
the
country
within
five
years
of
naturalization,
but
that
same
year
congress
suggested
that
a
thorough
study
be
made
to
the
entire
field
of
citizenship.
as
a
result,
secretary
of
state
root
appointed
three
high
state
department
officials
to
study
the
question.
this
citizenship
board
as
it
was
called
founded
the
class
of
americans
who
live
within
the
jurisdiction
of
foreign
countries
is
becoming
larger
each
year
and
the
question
of
their
protection
causes
increasing
embarrassment
to
this
government
in
its
relations
with
foreign
powers.
the
board
said
the
denial
of
diplomatic
protection
was
not
sufficient
since
they
left
too
much
to
the
uncertainty
or
fluctuations
of
executive
policy.
as
a
result
of
the
board's
recommendation,
congress
passed
the
nationality
act
1907
which
provided
that
if
a
naturalized
citizen
resided
in
the
foreign
state
of
his
origin
for
two
years
or
any
other
foreign
state
for
five
years
that
he
be
presumed
to
have
lost
his
american
citizenship.
in
explaining
this
provision,
the
house
committee
which
reported
the
bill
said,
perhaps
the
most
important
provision
of
the
bill
was
desired
by
the
state
department,
a
guard
against
complications
in
which
this
country
has
become
involved.
many
foreigners
come
here
become
naturalized
and
then
return
to
their
own
countries
or
migrate
to
other
parts
of
the
world
without
any
intention
of
returning
to
this
country.
such
a
provision
as
this
would
be
a
great
assistance
to
the
department
of
state,
would
avoid
possibilities
of
international
complications
and
will
prevent
those
who
are
not
entitled
to
its
protection
from
dishonestly
hiding
under
the
american
flag.
however,
the
1907
statute
did
not
worth
well
in
practice.
the
1933,
president
roosevelt
appointed
a
committee
composed
of
the
secretary
of
state,
the
secretary
of
labor,
and
the
attorney
general
to
review
all
the
nationality
laws.
after
five
years
of
intensive
study
by
experts
they
concluded
that
the
1907
statute
was
unsatisfactory
for
two
reasons
because
it
had
been
interpreted
to
cause
loss
of
protection
and
not
loss
of
citizenship
and
to
provide
only
a
presumption
and
not
a
definite
rule.
the
committee
went
on
to
state
that
the
problem
presented
by
naturalized
citizens
of
the
united
states
residing
in
the
foreign
countries
in
which
they
were
born
or
of
which
they
were
formerly
nationals
of
whom
there
are
thousands
at
the
present
day
has
been
a
cause
of
difficulty
and
embarrassment
to
the
government
of
united
states
in
the
effort
to
stand
protection
to
other
naturalized
citizens
in
meritorious
cases.
a
definite
provision
for
the
termination
of
american
nationality
will
have
the
affect
of
persuading
foreign
states
to
recognize
the
american
nationality
of
the
persons
concerned
when
they
return
to
their
countries
of
origin
for
legitimate
objects
and
for
residence
of
a
temporary
character.
there
are
several
other
statements
of
the
similar
kind
which
i
will
not
go
on
to
quote.
they
are
contained
in
the
government
brief.
on
the
basis
of
the
committee's
report,
congress
provided
in
the
nationality
act
of
1940
that
the
expatriation
of
the
naturalized
citizens
after
two
years
residence
in
the
country
of
their
origin
if
they
whereby
reacquire
their
former
nationality,
three
years
residence
in
the
country
of
their
origin
if
they
did
not
reacquired
their
former
nationality
and
after
five
years
residence
in
any
other
country.
the
same
provisions
were
contained
--
were
retained
by
the
congress
in
the
1952
act
except
that
the
two
year
provision
was
omitted
and
the
definition
of
the
residence
was
tightened
to
make
sure
that
evasion
could
not
occur
by
brief
trips
to
the
united
states.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
that's,
i
think
that's
a
much
more
difficult
question.
it's
a
question
that
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
i
think,
to
be
frank
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
great
deal
more
likelihood
of
embarrassment
than
for
a
native
born
citizen
in
that
situation.
i
think
what
is
different
from
a
native
born
citizen
is
that
congress
thought
that
likelihood
of
alien
nation
of
allegiance
is
greater
for
a
naturalized
citizen
than
a
native
born
citizen
even
when
he
is
in
a
third
country.
however,
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that
is
not
this
case.
that
provision
was
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
a
certiorari
was
denied
by
the
supreme
court
a
number
of
years
ago.
the
1952
provisions
were
subjected
to
extensive
criticism
in
congress
in
the
congressional
hearings
including
of
the
five
year
provision
in
section
352
a
(2).
however,
we
have
found
no
criticism
of
section
352
a
(1)
which
is
i
have
indicated
is
the
only
provision
which
is
involved
here.
i
think
the
experience
of
other
countries
including
of
the
other
great
democracies
is
also
instructed.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
the
kind
of
the
kind
of
embarrassments
your
honor
the
actual
situations
which
were
discussed
by
the
presidentially
appointed
committee
that
reported
in
1938
they
gave
13
illustrations.
now
as
appellant's
counsel
indicates
as
to
12
of
them.
the
embarrassments
are
indicated.
as
to
the
13th
embarrassment
was
that
the
property
of
this
person
was
confiscated
and
the
united
states
apparently
was
in
the
position
of
trying
to
intervene
on
his
behalf.
however,
there
is
a
long
history
of
embarrassments
particularly
over
military
service
and
in
addition
over
the
attempts
of
american
citizens
to
leave
various
countries
because
there
was
a
very
major
controversy
with
poland
after
world
war
ii
in
which
american
citizens
were
not
allowed
to
leave
poland
and
some
of
them
were
incarcerated
apparently
because
of
doubts
as
to
their
political
loyalty.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think,
i
am
not
certain
of
that
your
honor
i
think
they
did,
i
think
these
were
formally
polish
citizens
and
that's
why
they
exercised,
they
claimed
to
have
jurisdiction
over
them.
a
very
few
foreign
countries
attempt
to
exercise
dominion
or
jurisdiction
over
native
born
american
citizens
in
the
absence
of
an
affirmative
act
such
as
a
crime
of
some
sort
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor
i
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
let
me
address
myself
directly
to
the
question
of
administrative
convenience.
administrative
convenience
entered
into
it,
what
the
department
of
state
found
was
that
it
could
end
the
embarrassments
without
having
a
statute
which
it
could
minister.
now,
to
that
extent
the
administrative
convenience
entered
in.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
your
honor
that's
certainly
not
this
case.
as
i've
indicated,
we
think
there
is
100
years
of
history
of
very
definite
embarrassments.
now,
the
number
of
embarrassments
in
the
19th
century,
moore's
book
international
law
digest
has
i
think
it
approximately
70
pages
of
one
situation
after
another
involving
variations
on
these
problem
different
factual
situations.
so
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
that
embarrassments
are
potentially
possible
and
that
they
do
arise.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
potentiality
with
any
american
citizen
but
history
has
shown
that
is
most
likely
with
naturalized
americans
citizens.
as
i
have
indicated
very
few
countries
attempt
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
native
born
americans
citizens.
they
don't
feel
that
they
can
claim
anything
as
to
them,
they
may
expel
them.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
yes
its
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
the
basis
for
my
response
to
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
the
foreign
affairs
difficulties
are
markedly
less
in
regards
to
section
3
52
a
(2).
all
the
--
mr.
justice
white,
all
the
history
which
i
have
set
forth
has
involved
naturalized
citizens.
all
the
statements
by
the
department
of
state,
all
the
underlying
embarrassments
have
all
involved
naturalized
citizens.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
they
are
--
not
nearly
to
the
same
extent,
not
nearly
to
the
same
extent
but
there
is,
certainly
have
been
embarrassments
by
native
born
citizens.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
congress
has
the
full
power
to
decide
who
can
become
a
citizen.
now
there
certainly
cannot
i
--
the
government
is
not
contending
that
it
can
impose
any
restriction
on
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
they
could
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
i
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
i
think
you
can
--
i
think
that
is
exactly
what
madison
said
that
that
congress
did
have
that
power.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no
it
would
not.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
would
let
mrs.
schneider
on
under
the
wire
because
this
provision
is
identical
to
that
under
the
1940
statute
and
in
fact
we
do
suggest
that
in
our
brief
that
she
became
a
citizen
with
this
condition
attached.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
that,
i
think
that
would
beat
the
problem.
i
don't
--
i
am
not
at
all
sure
why
that
would
be
preferable
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
though.
i
think
that
would
raise
the
same
difficulties
as
this
case
and
in
addition
it
might
raise
the
difficulty
which
mr.
justice
black
suggested
in
his
opinion
in
the
trop
case
about
executive
discretion.
so
i
think
probably
we
just
have
one
additional
constitutional
argument
if
that
were
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
that
--
i
think
there
is
some
possibility
of
that.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
your
honor
that
would
not,
that
kind
of
a
statute
in
no
way
solves
the
problem
which
i
have,
which
i
have
been
discussing.
it
indicates,
it
does
solve
one
problem
or
at
least
it
tends
to
solve
it,
it
indicates
the
person
is
not
giving
up
all
allegiance
to
the
united
states
by
coming
--
by
telling
the
consul
that
he
still
wishes
to
be
an
american
citizen,
but
the
possibility
of
embarrassment
with
foreign
countries
remains
the
same.
they
don't
care
whether
this
person
claims
to
be
an
american
citizen,
they
know
that.
they
claim
that
the
person
is
still
their
citizen
or
has
reacquired
their
citizenship
and
this
is
the
problem
in
the
19th
century
which
is
so
clear,
of
two
different
states
asserting
jurisdiction
over
the
same
person.
and
so
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
doesn't
have
any
discretion
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
doesn't
any
discretion.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
your
honor
one,
there
is
a
short
answer
to
this.
one
of
the,
one
of
the
quickest
answer
i
think
that
except
for
one
exception
this
provision
doesn't
apply
to
the
statute
with
which
we
are
dealing,
it
involves
--
it
has
application
of
352
a
(2)
again
the
statute
that
i
was
discussing
with
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
the
five
year
provision
which
does
not
apply
to
the
appellant.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
the
secretary
of
state
may
have
--
i
would
debate
that
he
does
not
have
unlimited
discretion
under
that,
but
i
without
trying
to
discuss
that
problem,
the
short
answer
is
that
that
this
provision
in
no
way
covers
the
appellant.
it
cannot
first
of
all
of
course
she
did
not
serve
any
armed
forces
obviously
and
second
of
all,
it
simple
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
which
--
your
honor
i
must
insist
that
that
is
not
this
case,
there
is
nothing
from
statute.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
there
was
a
provision
in
this
statute
saying
that
not
only
each
provision
is
separable,
but
every
application
is
separable.
the
only
thing
that's
been
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
i
just
--
would
like
to
make
this
particular
your
point
what
is
before
the
court
is
not
even
the
entire
confines
of
this
provision,
what
is
before
the
court
is
its
application
to
this
appellant
under
section
406
of
the
act.
now
turning
to
the
experience
of
other
countries
which
some
members
of
the
court
indicated
was
of
importance
in
the
marcus'
case,
30
countries
provide
for
the
expatriation
of
citizens
based
on
residents
abroad
are
from
two
to
ten
years.
in
25
of
these
countries,
including
the
united
kingdom
and
seven
commonwealth
countries,
these
provisions
do
not
apply
to
native
born
citizens.
and
i
think
this
is
a
general
recognition
in
the
world
that
the
problem
is
markedly
different
between
native
born
citizens
and
naturalized
citizens.
the
government
submits
that
the
history
which
i've
just
described
very
briefly
(inaudible)
how
much
there
is,
but
this
history
is
conclusive.
this
court
has
repeatedly
relied
on
history
and
especially
in
the
views
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
such
as
madison
to
determine
whether
governmental
action
violates
personal
rights
protected
by
the
constitution.
for
example,
in
recent
terms
such
history
was
relied
on
the
prior
cases.
here
the
history
from
the
earliest
days
of
this
republic
shows
a
prolonged
residence
abroad
has
been
considered
as
justifying
expatriation
and
that
a
distinction
has
been
consistently
made
between
naturalized
and
native
born
citizens.
madison
himself
plainly
stated
that
naturalized
citizens
maybe
required
to
maintain
residence
in
the
united
states.
the
power
of
congress
to
expatriate
under
the
section
we
believe
is
also
supported
by
the
perez
case
not
on
the
problem
of
the
distinction
between
naturalized
and
native
born
citizens,
but
the
basic
power
to
expatriate
because
of
residence
abroad.
in
perez,
this
court
sustained
a
statute
providing
for
expatriation
because
of
voting
in
a
formal
election
on
the
ground
that
it
might
embroil
the
united
states
and
foreign
difficulties.
we
submit
that
the
history
of
this
section
is
far
more
clear,
far
stronger,
has
far
more
evidence
than
that
involved
in
perez.
just
since
world
war
ii,
problems
have
arisen
with
poland,
belgium,
greece,
france,
iran,
israel,
switzerland
and
turkey
and
we
submit
that
there
is
no
basis
for
saying
that
this
is
just
an
administrative
problem.
this
is
a
genuine
current
problem
in
international
relations.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
section
353
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
they
are
in
the
--
i
think
page
two
or
three
of
the
government's
brief
and
there
are
so
in
the
appendix
to
appellant's
brief
on
pages
76,
78.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no
you
were
reading
from
section
354
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
and
that's
section
354.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
ones
on
pages
76
to
the
top
of
78.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
apply
to
section
which
we're
dealing
with.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
in
perez
this
court
also
noted
that
voting
in
foreign
elections
suggested
a
transfer
of
allegiance
from
the
united
states
to
a
foreign
country.
now
the
court
has
said
that
this
was
not
without
significance.
it
did
not
say
that
this
was
crucial
to
the
decision
as
the
appellant
contends,
but
even
if
it
were
crucial
to
the
decision
in
perez,
even
if
we
assume
that,
surely
prolonged
residence
in
one's
former
homeland
signifies
far
more
clearly
a
transfer
of
allegiance,
than
the
brief
single
act
of
voting.
therefore,
the
factor
of
residence
has
been
considered
crucial
in
determining
citizenship
by
the
international
court,
by
text
writers
on
international
law
as
well
as
by
the
many
foreign
countries
which
i
have
noted.
i
think
the
relevance
of
a
prolonged
stay
in
one's
homeland
to
transfer
of
allegiance,
to
dilution
of
allegiance
is
well
expressed
by
the
cabinet
committee
appointed
by
president
roosevelt.
needless
to
say
naturalized
citizens
who
resume
residence
in
the
foreign
lands
from
which
they
came
are
apt
to
renew
old
associations
and
ways
of
living
and
thinking
and
thus
become
merged
in
the
native
population,
losing
to
a
great
degree,
if
not
completely
their
american
character
and
feeling.
this
makes
it
all
the
more
desirable
that
american
nationality
and
not
merely
the
right
to
diplomatic
protection
of
this
government
shall
be
terminated.
now
turning
to
the
appellant's
principle
contention,
i
think
the
most
serious
contention
in
this
case,
the
distinction
between
naturalized
and
native
born
citizens,
the
appellant
relies
on
statements
in
osborn
versus
the
national
bank
and
other
cases
by
this
court,
all
which
i
think
are
dictum
but
which
i
think
were
seriously
considered,
where
this
court
has
said
that
naturalized
and
native
born
citizens
stand
on
the
same
footing.
the
government
has
two
answers
to
appellant's
contention.
first,
the
constitution
itself
shows
that
naturalized
citizens
have
more
limited
political
rights
than
native
born
citizens
and
in
addition
the
statement
by
madison
upon
which
i
rely
before
shows
that
residence
was
considered
so
interrelated
with
naturalization,
that
it
could
be
made
a
requirement
of
citizenship.
therefore,
while
we
believe
that
the
statement
in
osborn
is
generally
true,
that
the
constitution
and
history
demonstrate
that
it
has
certain
narrow
exceptions
vitally
related
to
the
question
of
naturalization
itself.
now
the
second
reason
that
we
think
that
appellant
errs
is
that
even
though
all
american
citizens
must
be
treated
equally,
congress
of
course
can
make
reasonable
distinctions
between
various
classes
of
citizens.
for
example,
rich
citizens
and
poor
citizens
stand
on
the
same
footing,
bankers
and
workers
stand
on
the
same
footing,
but
this
does
not
prevent
congress
from
making
rational
distinctions
between
them.
therefore,
we
submit
that
the
crucial
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
distinction
between
naturalized
and
native
born
citizens
was
a
rational
one.
i
may
say
at
this
point
that
this
is
not
a
question
of
--
as
in
the
japanese
cases
of
putting
a
label
on
particular
people,
of
saying
that
some
people
are
better
than
others,
there
is
no
contention,
that
mr.
schneider
or
anybody
else
was
disloyal
or
treasonable
or
the
like.
this
is
a
regulation
of
foreign
affairs.
what
we
do
say
is
that
mrs.
schneider
and
other
people
similarly
situated
cause
serious
problems
in
american
foreign
relations.
now
i
have
stressed
before
that
it's
long
been
recognized
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
native
born
and
naturalized
citizens,
both
in
relation
to
conflict
with
foreign
governments
and
in
relation
to
the
possibility
of
the
transfer
of
their
allegiance
to
foreign
governments.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
distinction
between
naturalized
and
native
born?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
with
the
exception
of
the
foreign
statute
and
the
1907
statute.
no
there
has
never
been
a
statute,
but
their
unbroken
executive
policy
in
the
19th
century
made
this
distinction.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
no
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no
the
first
statute
is
in
1907,
we
think
that
executive
--
the
history
starting
with
the
exercise
of
executive
discretion
is
equally
relevant,
since
this
was
discretion
exercised
by
the
agency
which
conducts
american
foreign
relations.
therefore
we
submit
that
section
352
(a)
(1)
deals
with
the
most
acute
problems
of
foreign
relations
and
transfers
of
allegiance,
we
believe
there
can
be
very
little
doubt
that
congress
has
the
power
of
legislating
where
the
problem
is
most
serious
without
legislating
where
a
lesser
danger
is
presented.
in
fact,
i
cannot
see
how
anything
very
basic
would
be
protected
by
extending
this
statute
to
native
born
citizens.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
is
done
what
your
honor?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
and
that
congress
has
made
other
distinctions
too.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
your
honor,
i
think
probably
the
major
reason
for
the
five-year
provision
is
the
question
of
retransfer
of
allegiance
and
it
was
thought
by
congress
that
the
likelihood
of
retransfer
of
allegiance
is
less
in
a
third
country
than
it
is
in
your
native
country.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it's
not
a
matter
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
a
matter
any
of
this
being
solicited
to
some
other
countries,
i
think
it's
the
question
of
being
solicited
to
this
country.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honors
i
suggested
to
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
think
it's
--
a
government
would
have
a
very
difficult
burden
of
trying
to
show
foreign
relations
embarrassments
from
that
provision
which
is
not
involved
in
this
case
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
five
year
provision,
but
i
again
emphasize
that
352
(a)
(1)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
your
honor,
precisely.
i
may
say
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
i
may
say
something
further
about
the
five
year
provision.
it
was
adopted
not
at
the
behest,
originally
it
was
not
adopted
at
the
behest
of
the
cabinet
committee,
the
1933
cabinet
committee.
congress
went
beyond
the
recommendations
of
the
cabinet
committee
and
passed
the
five-year
provision.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
these
are
native
born
americans,
you
are
talking
about
now?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
if
needed
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
your
honor,
that
they
can
--
that
the
--
first
congress
has
the
power
to
take
away
citizenship
from
native
born
or
american
citizens
--
or
naturalized
citizens,
if
there
was
a
showing
of
strong
likelihood
of
embarrassment
in
american
foreign
affairs.
now
as
i've
indicated
mr.
justice
brennan,
i'm
not
sure
we
can
make
that
showing
as
to
native
born
citizens.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor's
question
suggest
some,
a
problem
that
face
congress,
if
we
had,
if
congress
had
passed
a
statute
providing
that
all
citizens
lost
their
citizenship
upon
three
years
residence
abroad
then
it
would
have
been
subject
to
attack,
whenever
a
native
born
citizen
was
expatriated
on
the
ground
that
we
could
not
make
a
sufficient
showing
of
embarrassment
and
embroiling
the
united
states
in
foreign
conflict.
congress
didn't
do
that.
it
said,
well
we
will
deal
with
the
heart
of
the
problem.
so
it
dealt
with
naturalized
citizens.
now,
we
are
faced
with
the
contention
that
congress
should
have
passed
the
statute
across
the
board
because
it
cannot
make
a
distinction
between
native
born
and
naturalized
citizens.
it
seems
to
me
that,
what
that
argument
means
is,
the
congress
cannot
deal
with
the
problem
and
the
problem
essentially
involves
naturalized
citizens.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
all
i
could,
your
honor
all
i
can
say
about
that
is
that
a
100
years
of
history
show
that
that
doesn't
work.
the
department
of
state,
numerous
secretaries
of
state,
numerous
experts
studying
the
problem
have
said,
have
found
and
that
people
like
i
think
they
were
harsh
in
their
attitudes
towards
american
citizenship
have
found
that
this
doesn't
work
and
i
think
it
doesn't
work
for
one
extremely
important
reason
and
that
is
just
as
it
was
stated
in
perez,
the
way
to
deal
with
the
problem
is
to
say
that
these
aren't
our
citizens
anymore.
as
long
as
we
are,
they
are
citizens
we've
got
a
problem,
we
cannot
just
completely
wash
our
hands
of
them,
what
if
they
want
to
return
to
the
united
states,
certainly
every
citizen
has
that
right.
revocation
of
diplomatic
protection
certainly
couldn't
extend
to
our
saying
to
a
still,
a
person
who
is
still
a
citizen
that
we
won't
try
to
get
you
back
to
the
united
states,
this
was
the
problem
in
poland.
it's
the
problem
in
iran,
and
israel
at
the
present
time.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
mainly
your
honor
they
say
that
you
can't
travel
to
those
countries
and
that
maybe
one
of
the
reasons
if
they
say
it
is
they
don't
want
to
be
involved
in
problems
once
the
person
is
there
even
having
warned
may
not
be
enough
to
prevent
the
conflict.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
i
am
sorry
i
don't
entirely
follow.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
the
concern
is
not
about
foreign
influences,
the
concern
is
about
demands
that
are
placed
in
our
citizens
by
foreign
governments.
this
may
mean
locking
them
up,
it
may
mean
throwing
them
to
the
army.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
i
may
say
that
i
think
you
are
dealing
--
you
are
discussing
state
legislation
not
federal
legislation
and
the
states
apparently
those
states
no
longer
exist
today,
those
states
apparently
regarded
aliens
who
lived
a
while
in
this
country
is
having
been
influenced
by
american
ways.
now
i
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes
your
honor
i
think
actually
this
is
maybe
support
more
broad
position.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
reason,
i
suggest
that
is
apparently
the
states'
believe
that
an
alien
who
lived
in
this
country
for
a
while
took
on
enough
american
ways
so
he
could
be
trusted
to
vote
in
american
elections.
we
think
that
an
american
citizen
who
lives
long
enough
in
a
foreign
country
also
assumes
enough
of
the
ways
of
that
country
so
they
should
no
longer
be
considered
an
american
citizen.
i
like
to
point
out
that
section
352
a
(1),
if
discrimination
against
naturalized
citizens
is
a
very,
very
limited
one
in
its
terms,
in
terms
it
applies
only
to
the
country
of
origin
of
the
naturalized
citizen.
now,
there
is
no
country
of
origin
of
native
born
citizens.
now,
passing
that
question
of
discrimination
in
its
terms
looking
to
its
effect,
section
352
a
(1)
says
that
a
naturalized
citizen
cannot
live
more
than
three
years
in
one
country
in
the
world,
the
country
from
which
he
originally
came.
and
it
makes
broad
exceptions
from
this
in
section
353,
where
congress
felt
that
the
particular
problems
which
i've
discussed
did
not
exist
and
we
submit
that
this
is
a
far
smaller
discrimination
than
this
court
upheld
in
mackenzie
and
hare.
there
this
court
upheld
a
statute
which
suspended
citizenship,
took
it
away
for
a
period
of
time
which
might
be
life
because
an
american
women
married
a
foreigner
while
not
taking
away
citizenship
from
american
men
who
married
foreign
women.
i'd
like
also
to
point
out
that
section
352
a
(1)
has
much
less
effect,
the
expatriation
of
people
covered
by
352
a
(1)
is
far
less
severe
than
it
would
be
on
native
born
citizens.
this
provision
applies
only
the
persons
who
returned
to
their
former
homelands
and
reside
their
for
over
three
years.
they
are
likely
to
be
either
dual
nationals
or
as
in
this
case
able
to
reacquire
citizenship
extremely
easily.
i
mean
to
say
that
there
is
a
substantial
question
whether
is
not
a
dual
national.
the
main
reason
germany
describes
her
as
stateless
because
she
wants
to
be
labeled
as
stateless
and
in
our
view
under
german
law
she
did
not,
probably
did
not
lose
her
citizenship
because
either
she
nor
her
mother
ever
applied
to
the
government
or
to
a
court
in
germany
at
the
time
that
she
acquired
american
citizenship,
but
even
passing
that,
that
isn't
crucial
to
the
case,
passing
that
she
can
easily
reacquire
german
citizenship,
she
is
not
in
the
situation
of
a
person
who
is
going
to
be
stateless
in
the
real
sense.
she
wants
american
citizenship.
it's
a
valuable
right,
i
wouldn't
deny
it,
but
she
is
not
in
a
situation
of
having
no
right
as
a
citizen
of
any
country.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes
your
honor.
i
know
about
how
many
become
expatriated
a
year
under
this
section,
the
1940
act
and
the
bancroft
treaties
which
also
take
away
citizenship
on
substantially
the
same
basis
and
probably
would
be
effected
by
an
adverse
decision
to
the
government
in
this
case.
it's
approximately
a
1000
citizens
a
year,
under
352
a
(1),
about
900
to
1100
or
1200
a
year.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
my
figures
don't
go
back
quite
to
1940
but
that's
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
the
statistics
for
a
decade
show
that
it's
about
1000
a
year.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
your
honor.
now,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
this
court
in
bolling
and
sharpe
implied
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
contain
all
the
content
which
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
to
the
states,
but
even
if
it
did
it
bars
only
unreasonable
classifications
and
i
think
history
establishes
beyond
any
doubt
that
this
classification
has
been
considered
reasonable
and
is
still
reasonable.
i
now
like
to
turn
to
the
particular
facts
of
this
case
because
as
i
have
indicated
i
think
that
what
is
involved
here
when
reduced
to
its
core
is
whether
congress
had
the
power
to
provide
for
the
appellant's
expatriation
in
the
view
of
section
406.
appellant
has
made
clear
that
she
has
no
that
she
has
the
intention
of
remaining
in
germany
indefinitely.
her
husband
has
a
law
practice
there,
he
apparently
is
going
to
stay,
she
naturally
is
going
to
stay
with
him
and
that
she
has
no
intent
of
ever
residing
in
the
united
states
except
that
she
expects
that
she
will
make
visits
here
as
she
has
made
in
the
past.
therefore,
her
case
falls
within
the
bancroft
treaties.
it
falls
within
the
situations
which
were
governed
by
the
discretion
of
the
secretary
of
state
at
the
end
of
the
19th
century.
in
other
words,
her
situation
falls
within
the
narrow
core
of
cases
which
raise
most
acutely
the
foreign
affairs
problems
and
the
problems
of
transfer
of
allegiance.
looking
at
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
looking
at
the
effect
of
expatriation
on
her,
assuming
that
that
is
relevant,
appellant
--
all
that
appellant
looses
here
other
than
that
she
wants
to
have
the
good
feeling
that
she
is
an
american
citizen,
she
wants
american
diplomatic
protection,
she
wants
to
travel
to
united
states
without
a
visa,
and
at
if
some
unforeseen
adversity
occurs
she
wants
to
be
able
to
come
here
at
will.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
bancroft
was
the
minister
to
the
north
german
confederation.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
from
the
united
states.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there
are
now
21
nations,
it
is
–
varied
some
--
but
there
are
still
21
now
nations
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
because
the
first
treaty
was
with
the
north
german
confederation
and
i
suppose
he
must
have
had
something
to
do
with
it.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
1868.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
1868.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
therefore
in
the
government's
view
what
the
appellant
wants
is
that
she
wants
the
benefits
of
citizenship
while
remaining
to
practical
purposes
a
foreigner
and
we
don't
think
that
congress
was
constitutionally
required
to
let
her
retain
her
citizenship
in
these
circumstances
considering
the
likelihood
of
foreign
policy
embarrassments.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
we
could
impose,
we
could
impose
burdens
on
them
your
honor
and
we
do.
the
point
that
i
am
making
is
not
that
she
is,
obviously
she
hasn't
failed
to
serve
in
the
armed
forced
and
i
assume
that
she
has
paid
whatever
taxes
she
is
supposed
to
pay
whether
there
are
any
or
not
on
the,
on
any
income,
but
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
didn't
suggest
your
honor
that
she
has
failed
in
any
of
her
obligations
to
american
--
to
her
american
nationality.
all
i
have
--
i
don't
consider
her
disloyal,
i
don't
think
the
congress
considered
her
disloyal.
what
i
do
say
is
that
she
left
the
country,
she
has
put
herself
in
a
position
where
she
can
cause
severe
foreign
policy
problems
that
in
these
circumstances
the
possibility
of
the
amount
of
time
from
her
expatriation
in
relatively
little
and
on
the
other
hand
the
problems
that
she
creates
are
the
most
severe
of
people
in
her
general
category.
i'd
finally
like
to
turn
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
see
no
reason
why
she
could
not
be
your
honor.
i
think
congress
has
–
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yeah,
i
don't
–
i
see
–
i
maybe
wrong
but
i
see
no
reason
why
that
could
not
be
accomplished.
i
may
say
that
despite
appealing
facts
–-
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
your
suggestion
would
cut
very,
very
deeply
into
all
kinds
areas.
it
would
make
deportation
statute
all
of
them
i
suppose
unconstitutional.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
but
i
think
the
point
of
what
i
was
trying
to
say
was
that,
congress
i
think
has
been
recognized
probably
since
the
beginning
as
having
the
right
as
a
matter
of
grace,
it
can
confer
benefits
on
isolated
individuals.
now
i
quite
agree
a
serious
problem
would
be
raised
if
they
then
went
out
and
did
this
carte
blanche
all
kinds
of
people
and
then
mrs.
schneider
wasn't
included
among
them;
that
might
raise
an
equal
protection
problem
insofar
as
it
applies
to
congress.
that
isn't
the
situation,
occasionally
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
if
that
–
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
if
there
is
something
wrong
with
that,
it
is
in
the
person
who
gets
the
private
bill,
that
person
has
been,
has
gotten
a
benefit
which
is
unfairly
conferred
upon
him.
it
does
not
--
certainly
one
benefit
cannot
mean
that
everybody
else
who
doesn't
get
that
benefit
thereby
has
a
right
to
be
put
in
the
same
place.
i
think
that
if
there
was,
if
–
a
contrary
doctrine
to
what
i've
stated
were
applied
to
the
law,
it
would
be
devastating
in
its
effect.
it
would
mean
one
person
who
wasn't
prosecuted
for
particular
crime
that
means
nobody
else
could
be
prosecuted.
they've
gotten
the
benefits
in
the
prosecutor
and
i
don't
think
that
that,
that
that
proposition
can
stand
in
view
of
the
way
the
equal
protection
clause
has
been
interpreted.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
i
only
–
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
brought
up,
perhaps
shouldn't
--
i
brought
up
the
prosecutor
only
that
many,
many
times,
in
many,
many
different
areas,
government
agencies
exercise
discretion
to
give
benefits
to
particular
people.
now
maybe
they
do
that
unfairly
but
that
certainly
can't
mean
that
every
other
person
has
the
right
to
be
treated
in
the
way
that
the
most
favorably
treated
person
can,
has
been
treated.
i
think
that
such
a
proposition
would
undermine
not
just
–
the
law,
criminal
law
but
deportation
law,
and
all
kinds
of
other
situations,
administrative
law,
all
kinds
of
situations.
now
the
--
in
the
last
couple
of
minutes
that
i
have
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
appellant's
argument
that
section
352,
after
saying
that
352
was
too
narrow
because
it
doesn't
apply
to
native
born
citizens,
defendant
also
argues
that
its
too
broad
because
congress
could
have
met
this
problem
by
passing
a
more
limited
statute.
however,
we
think
the
short
answer
to
this
is
mcculloch
and
maryland.
this
court
held
in
its
repeated
determination
numerous
times
that
it's
up
to
the
congress
and
not
up
to
the
courts
to
determine
which
among
the
rationale
alternatives
should
be
adopted.
and
this
principle
was
specifically
applied
to
area
of
expatriation
in
perez
against
brownell.
indeed
the
government
thinks
that
it
is
particularly
applicable
in
the
field
of
foreign
relations,
since
this
court
recognized
less
than
two
weeks
ago
in
the
sabatino
case
that
foreign
relations
are
peculiarly
committed
to
the
discretions
of
the
political
branches
of
the
government.
now,
the
history
as
i've
indicated
before
of
section
352
–
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes
your
honor,
when
the
purpose
of
congress
is
to
deal
with
the
serious
question
in
american
foreign
relations,
i
think
it
is.
the
means
may
have
to
do
with
something
in
the
united
states
but
the
purpose
and
the
field
being
regulated
is
foreign
relations.
i
think
that
--
i
think
the
perez
and
brownell
stands
for
this
proposition,
i
think
mackenzie
and
hare
does
in
terms.
as
i've
indicated
diplomatic
protections
has
been
tried,
has
been
found
wanting.
ad
hoc
executive
discretion
has
been
tried,
it
has
been
found
wanting.
therefore
congress
finally
after
years
and
years
of
experience
by
the
department
of
state
turned
to
the
method
which
is
now
in
the
1952
act,
we
think
that
this
was
a
perfect
rationale
decision,
first
because
a
clear
rule
is
necessary
to
dissuade
other
countries
from
interfering
with
american
citizens.
as
a
result,
american
citizens
are
better
protected
and
foreign
conflict
is
reduced.
in
addition
we
think
it's
--
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
individual
citizen
it's
important
that
he
have
a
clear
standard
of
what
acts
will
expatriate
him.
if
ad
hoc
executive
discretion
were
used,
as
the
appellant
contends,
i
think
the
appellant
would
have
a
far
better
constitutional
argument
than
she
actually
has
because
she
would
say
then
that
she
couldn't
tell
what
would
expatriate
her,
this
way
she
was
on
notice,
as
the
appellant's
counsel
says
she
knew
before
she
expatriated
herself
what
would
be
the
effect
of
her
continued
residence
in
germany,
she
deliberately
stayed
in
germany
and
took
the
consequences.
and
then
there
is
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
it's
of
course
a
perfectly
natural
thing
that
she
would
stay
with
her
husband,
but
it
still
was
a
voluntary
choice,
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
all
i
can
take
is
the
record,
she
says
she
is
going
to
--
she
makes
quite
clear
she
is
going
to
stay
in
germany.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
quite
right
your
honor,
but
the
point
is
that
she
is
going
to
continue
to
reside
abroad
and
that
is
the
point
that
--
that
is
the
very
thing
that
embroils
united
states
in
foreign
difficulties.
