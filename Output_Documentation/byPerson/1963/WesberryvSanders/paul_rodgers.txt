mr.
paul
rodgers
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
paul
rodgers
to
begin
with
your
honors,
i'll
attempt
to
clarify
and
simplify
our
position
by
beginning
with
--
giving
the
vague
contours
of
the
position
that
we
take
in
this
case.
first,
we
concede
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
over
the
subject
matter
of
this
litigation.
secondly,
we
concede
the
justiciability
as
the
merits
of
this
case.
and
third,
we
concede
the
standing
of
the
appellants
in
this
case.
our
position
is,
is
that
because
primarily
of
the
likelihood
of
an
available
political
remedy,
which
has
not
yet
had
a
chance
to
operate,
that
there
is
a
lack
of
equity
in
the
complaint
and
as
the
district
court
was
proper
in
dismissing
for
that
point.
we
consider
this
question
about
whether
or
not
the
court
should
retain
jurisdiction
by
leaving
the
complaint
on
file
or
else
from
the
other
hand
to
dismiss
the
complaint,
possibly
with
the
idea
of
a
suit
being
brought
after
reasonable
lapse
of
time.
we
say
that
does
not
go
to
the
substance,
it
goes
to
the
form.
we
are
concerned
with
the
form
of.
we
say
that's
not
a
matter
of
substance.
now,
the
brief
is
divided
into
two
parts.
first,
we
say,
that
the
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court
for
want
of
equity.
and
that
right
there,
it's
subdivided
into
two
elements
that
a
political
question
doctrine
which
we
judge
is
a
wholly
--
as
long
as
did
not
wholly
an
abstention
doctrine
to
perform
itself
and
of
course
the
conventionable
--
conventional
equitable
abstention
doctrine.
the
second
part
of
our
brief
goes
upon
the
thesis
that
the
case
is
moot
as
the
last
general
election
and
that
is
--
and
the
case
is
premature
as
the
next
general
election.
for
the
point
of
prematurity,
we
cite
remmey
versus
smith
which
in
itself
is
an
application
of
the
equitable
abstention
doctrine.
so
we
won't
argue
both
points.
we
think
that
just
arguing
the
doctrine
of
equi
--
equitable
abstention
will
take
care
of
our
position
fully.
mr.
paul
rodgers
no,
sir.
we
say
in
our
point
--
in
our
prematurity
point
that
we
rely
on
remmey
versus
smith
and
--
and
the
court
in
remmey
versus
smith
said
that
the
suit
is
premature
in
that
case
because
there's
an
available
political
remedy.
in
other
words,
the
state
legislature
just
been
reapportioned.
and
for
that
reason,
we
want
to
give
the
state
legislature
an
opportunity
to
act
before
we
grant
relief
if
then.
in
other
words
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
that
was
after
the
reapportionment
but
the
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
that's
right
on
--
as
to
last
legislature,
your
honor,
the
senate
had
just
been
reapportioned.
and
of
course,
this
question
of
redistricting
the
congressional
district
of
a
state
is
a
matter
of
great
seriousness
and
a
bulk
of
consideration
had
to
be
taken
into
account.
there
was
no
time
for
any
committee
work
to
be
done.
there
has
been
and
there
is
being
now,
i
believe,
i
hope
sufficient
committee
work
to
where
a
good
bill
can
be
--
can
be
produced
for
consideration
by
the
legislature.
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
we
don't
--
we
say
that
it's
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
decide
the
ultimate
issue
in
this
area,
that
it
should
be
reserved
for
future
consideration.
now,
we
believe
that
with
the
elimination
of
the
county
unit
system
and
with
the
restructuring
of
the
state
legislature,
that
the
power
of
political
persuasion
in
georgia
is
now
in
the
hands
of
the
majority.
as
the
majority
will
use
the
power
that
has
been
conferred
upon
it
in
the
wake
of
baker
versus
carr,
that
they
can
bring
about
the
legislation
that
they
desire
an
area
of
congressional
district.
and
our
point
is
that
the
court,
the
federal
courts
should
give
the
power
of
the
majority
time
to
operate
through
the
conventional
political
remedy
and
then
if
that
is
not
successful
then
that
may
present
a
different
question.
now,
whether
or
not
ones
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
frankly,
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure.
i
think
that,
of
course,
is
a
judicial
question.
we
feel
that
additional
time
is
required.
i
couldn't
stand
here
and
tell
you
just
how
much
time
it
would
take
for
the
majority
to
--
someone
force
its
strength
and
to
try
to
get
the
legislation
it
desires.
i
don't
know
whether
one
session
would
be
enough
or
whether
it
would
take
two
or
just
how
much
time
it
would
require,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
rodgers
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
paul
rodgers
february
or
--
or
early
march.
i'm
not
sure
when
it
expires.
mr.
paul
rodgers
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
paul
rodgers
about
--
until
such
time
as
the
majority
has
had
a
chance
and
arouse
and
alert
citizenry
has
had
the
chance
to
bring
its
desires
to
bear
on
a
legislative
body.
now,
we
--
we
an
--
anticipate
and
we
feel
that
it's
likely
that
the
next
general
assembly
is
going
to
reapportion
the
congressional
districts.
mr.
paul
rodgers
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
rodgers
yes,
sir,
if
it's
to
be
done.
mr.
paul
rodgers
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
rodgers
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
paul
rodgers
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
paul
rodgers
yes,
sir,
at
that
time,
senator
wesberry
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
at
that
time
senator
wesberry
introduced
the
bill,
which
we
will
consider
the
merits
after
the
--
the
bill
did
not
pass.
but
after
the
session
was
over
with,
the
senate
has
publicly
in
his
power
with
the
committee,
certain
disparage
remarks
about
this
bill
and
those
remarks
were
true
and
obvious
the
bill
should
not
have
passed.
he
--
he
admitted
that
it
was
a
bad
bill
in
many
respects.
but
there
has
been
one
session
of
the
newly
reapportioned
legislature.
now,
one
point
there
that
i
think
it
is
significant,
the
three-judge
court
in
georgia
in
toombs
versus
fortson,
applied
the
federal
analogy.
in
other
words,
our
state
senate
is
apportioned
strictly
according
to
population.
our
house
of
representatives
apportion
on
a
geographic
basis
that
we
help
some
tilt
toward
the
majority
in
this
3-to-1
here
that
we
have,
which
you
saw
a
result
of
a
little
different
application
of
in
the
koenig
case.
now,
if
as
a
result
of
these
cases,
that
this
court
has
just
heard,
if
this
court
determines
that
both
houses
of
the
legislature
must
reflect
to
some
extent
population,
that
the
fair
analogy
does
not
apply
to
state
legislature
then
of
course
that
means
that
georgia
would
then
have
to
reconstitute
the
house
of
representatives.
and
that
way,
they
make
it
even
with
that
much
easier
for
the
majority
to
act
in
the
game
the
kind
of
legislature
they
desired.
we
say
the
majority
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
sir?
mr.
paul
rodgers
no,
sir.
the
bill
did
not
get
out
of
the
committee.
mr.
paul
rodgers
no
--
that's
right.
mr.
paul
rodgers
that's
right.
mr.
paul
rodgers
no,
sir,
we
don't
have
any
seniority
system
but
the
--
but
the
senate
is
apportioned
strictly
on
population.
the
senate,
it
is
much
responsive
to
the
majority
will
as
--
as
--
as
a
legislative
body
can
be.
i
don't
think
anyone
has
any
criticism
about
it,
i
say,
not
being
apportioned
with
population
but
we
claim
that
or
rather
we
can
show
that
even
senator
wesberry
himself
felt
that
it
was
bad
bill
by
statements
made
out
from
legislature.
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
i
assume
that
51%
--
roughly
51%
of
the
people
will
elect
--
roughly
51%
of
the
senators.
mr.
paul
rodgers
oh,
well,
i
don't
have
--
i
--
for
me,
i
--
i
have
not
run
the
ratio.
i'm
--
would
imagine
the
ratio.
in
fact,
i'm
sure
the
ratio
would
run
quite
high
because
very
clearly,
our
house
is
based
on
geography
and
of
course,
the
rural
areas
control
our
house
of
representatives.
but
that's
the
position
that
we
take
in
(inaudible)
fashion.
we
feel
the
ultimate
decision
in
this
area,
is
--
is
not
now
unnecessary
for
that
decision
to
be
made
and
it
should
be
reserved
for
future
consideration.
i
like
to
begin
with
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
now,
i
thoroughly
agree
with
the
appellant
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
is
entirely
clear
and
i
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general
when
he
makes
a
point
that
the
case
ought
to
be
remanded
for
trial
in
the
merits.
i
feel
that
that
is
completely
unnecessary
because
i
think
the
decision
is
quite
clear.
the
case
starts
off
with
a
review
of
the
historical
--
with
the
history
of
congressional
district
in
georgia
and
it
goes
on
to
say
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute
and
now
ample
for
final
decision
on
the
merits.
and
i
think
that
they
are
significant.
that
was
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
and
apparently
both
of
the
parties
in
this
matter.
the
court
goes
on
to
say
that
the
position,
it
goes
on
to
comment
upon
the
posture
of
redistricting
nationally.
said
it
is
the
position
of
the
plaintiff
that
the
population
of
each
district
should
be
within
the
range
of
10%
to
15%
of
the
average
district
population
based
on
division
on
the
number
of
districts
into
the
total
population
of
the
state.
the
court
goes
on
to
say
there
are
435
congressional
districts
in
the
united
states.22
congressmen
will
be
elected
state
at
large
in
1962.
of
the
remaining
413,
the
fifth
district
of
texas
has
the
largest
population
of
951,527.
there
are
22
districts
with
populations
exceeding
600,000.
eight
districts
having
population
of
more
than
15%
above
the
state
average
while
the
nine,
they
have
populations
of
more
than
15%
below
the
state
district
average.
using
10%
of
the
variants
for
tolerance,
108
districts
are
above
and
125
are
below
the
average,
a
total
of
233
or
more
than
one-half
of
the
--
of
all
the
congressional
districts.
so
that
(inaudible)
which
had
borne
out
by
the
record,
it
indicates
that
the
congressional
districts
of
the
nation
by
and
large
are
malapportioned
if
he
use
population
as
the
standard.
and
of
course,
this
is
just
purely
as
directed
to
the
figures
of
population.
it
does
not
include
the
problem,
related
problem
of
gerrymander
and
of
course
that
this
court
would
get
involved
in
this
area.
i
would
assume
the
gerrymander
in
equities,
so
to
speak,
arise
from
the
gerrymander
would
be
just
offensive
as
a
--
as
the
variation
of
population
stand
if
this
court
would
get
involved
in
that
area.
but
we
can
see
briefly
and
from
the
record
and
from
the
opinion,
that
this
whole
country
is
maldistricted
congressionally.
and
there
we
say,
it's
another
reason
why
this
apportionment
is
reapportioned
from
the
congressional
districts
in
the
first
instance,
should
be
left
to
the
state
legislatures.
because
if
this
court
were
to
in
it's
--
in
it's
remand
to
say
georgia's
congressional
districts
are
malapportioned,
maybe,
you
come
up
--
maybe
with
come
forth
with
some
criterion
about
all
the
districts
have
to
be
substantially
equal.
if
this
court
was
to
come
forth
with
that
criterion
in
this
case,
then
of
course,
that
would
inject
the
district
court
all
across
the
nation
into
the
area,
into
the
field
of
congressional
districting.
and
we've
seen
a
recent
case
of
that
in
baker
versus
carr.
in
fact,
i
would
imagine
in
baker
versus
carr
that
this
court
has
--
has
a
great
deal
of
pride
in
the
alacrity
that
the
district
courts
have
acted
in
because
across
the
nation
in
baker
versus
carr
did
not
give
i
think
quite
properly
so,
the
district
court
no
criteria
to
follow.
but
yet
the
district
courts
have
--
have
approached
this
job
with
an
eagerness
and
i
would
imagine
this
court
is
well
satisfied
with
it
but
you're
going
to
see
the
same
thing
with
congressional
districting.
and
--
but
yet,
you've
already
put
in
to
play
--
you've
advised
which
is
going
to
soon
correct
any
dissatisfaction
with
congressional
districting
to
reapportion
state
legislatures.
and
so
i
think
that
in
viewing
this
situation,
it's
important
for
this
court
to
look
at
the
national
situation.
and
we're
not
just
concerned
here
with
georgia
because
the
whole
nation
is
watching
the
decision
of
this
case.
the
district
court
went
on
to
say
in
commenting
among
present
system.
it
says
it
now
reflects
the
system
which
has
become
arbitrary
through
inaction
when
consider
in
the
light
of
the
present
population
to
fifth
district
and
as
measured
by
any
conceivable
reasonable
standard.
now,
i
don't
know
what
much
--
what
more
anyone
could
want
whether
it's
the
solicitor
general
or
the
appellant.
that's
a
very
strong
statement.
the
court
goes
on
to
say,
our
view
is
practiced
by
due
regard
for
the
admonition
in
baker
versus
carr
that
a
judicially
manageable
standard
must
be
adopted.
this
dictates
that
a
reasonable
time
be
afforded
for
the
state
for
the
normal
state
government
processes
where
there
is
a
substantial
chance
of
relief
as
we
believe
there
is
to
run
their
course.
the
court
goes
on
to
review
colegrove.
and
of
course,
as
this
court
pointed
out,
i
think
properly
so,
the
colegrove
decision,
itself,
four
of
the
justices
there,
recognized
that
the
court
had
jurisdiction
in
justiciabilty.
but
--
and
for
those
as
justice
rutledge
though
felt
there
was
not
sufficient
equity
in
the
petition
and
because
he
joined
with
justice
frankfurter
and
read
in
burton,
the
petition
was
dismissed
but
at
the
same
time,
i
think
that
is
as
significance
in
colegrove.
the
district
court
attach
to
it.
that
was
--
that
has
clearly
been
pointed
out
in
baker
versus
carr
as
of
the
treatment
to
be
received,
to
be
accorded
to
colegrove
versus
green
in
the
future.
now,
the
court
goes
on
to
say,
and
this
they're
--
next
to
the
final
paragraph,
it
said,
"we
do
not
deem
it
to
be
present
for
dismissal
based
on
the
non-justiciability
of
a
political
question
involving
the
congress
here
but
we
do
deem
to
be
strong
authority
for
dismissal,
for
want
of
equity
when
the
following
factors
are
involved.
here
involved
are
considered
on
balance,
a
political
question
involving
the
coordinate
branch
of
the
federal
government,
a
political
question
posing
a
delicate
problem
difficult
of
solution
without
depriving
the
others
of
the
right
to
vote
by
district
unless
we
are
to
redistrict
for
the
state.
relief
maybe
forthcoming
from
a
properly
apportioned
state
legislature
and
relief
maybe
afforded
by
congress.
now,
i
think
that
is
quite
clear
that
the
court,
the
district
court,
all
the
three
judges
of
the
district
court,
recognized
that
there
was
justiciability,
that
this
did
not
fall
entirely
within
the
political
question
doctrine
which
is
fully
insulated
from
judicial
review.
there
were
some
elements
of
it.
i
think
its
reference
to
the
congressional
remedy
and
that
involving
a
coequal
branch
of
government,
exerted
some
reluctance
upon
the
district
court
to
act
but
it
by
no
means
equated
that
with
a
perpetual
refusal
--
refusal
not
to
ever
act.
and
now,
to
save
the
point,
justice
tuttle,
filed
a
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion.
and
there
seems
to
be
--
as
i
analyze
the
opinion,
very
little
difference
between
their
views.
the
question
that
seems
to
divide
them
was
whether
or
not
petition
should
be
dismissed.
now,
this
court
has
frequently
applying
the
doctrine
of
equitable
abstention,
has
frequently
permitted
the
petition
to
be
dismissed
with
the
understanding,
sometimes
implied
that
if
things
were
not
corrected
or
if
the
state
did
not
afford
a
remedy,
the
suit
could
be
reinstituted
after
the
expiration
of
a
reasonable
time.
mr.
paul
rodgers
yes.
mr.
paul
rodgers
i
--
i
agree
there's
a
difference.
i
would
not
refer
to
that
as
a
big
difference
because
the
court
in
the
last
--
the
majority
connected
up
several
of
these
things
and
then
put
them
together
with
an
end.
and
so
i
would
think
that
if
after
the
expiration
of
a
reasonable
period
of
time,
if
the
state
did
not
afford
remedy,
then
--
then
they
would
--
the
appellants
would
be
entitled
to
return
and
would
probably
give
relief
from
a
full
court.
i
do
not
interpret
at
all
that
the
two
judges
who
formed
the
majority
opinion
felt
that
there
should
never
be
any
relief
granted.
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
we
would
prefer,
your
honor,
that
the
petition
be
dismissed.
we
feel
your
honor,
that
the
dismissal
of
the
petition
is
primarily
a
matter
of
form
but
the
only
difference
between
dismissing
the
petition
and
retaining
the
petition
is
it
will
involve
some
additional
court
calls
which
won't
amount
much.
they
won't
involve
much
time
because
in
this
case,
they've
already
got
a
decision
of
the
merit
in
two
months.
and
you've
only
got
two
months
time
and
a
small
amount
of
court
calls,
then
we
feel
that
because
of
comity
between
the
united
states
and
the
state
governments.
between
this
court
that
this
court
has
traditionally
shown
the
state
governments.
and
because
of
the
--
because
of
the
sovereignty
and
because
of
the
deference
that
this
court
has
traditionally
shown
the
states
for
the
--
since
farther
working
to
the
healthy
federalism
that
the
petition
should
not
be
overhanging.
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
not
entirely.
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
what
i
--
what
--
what
we
say
this
court
should
decide
is,
we
say
that
it
should
not
re
--
resolve
the
ultimate
issue.
what
we
say
this
court
should
decide
there,
is
that
we
have
reconstituted
that
pursuant
to
baker
versus
carr,
we
reconstituted
the
state
legislature
and
we
have
eliminated
the
county
unit
system.
it
may
be
necessary
to
reconstitute
the
half,
we
don't
know.
but
after
all
of
that's
been
accomplished
and
we
have
a
constitutional
legislature,
then
we
say
to
this
court,
you
say
to
the
appellant,
"you
should
then
try
to
get
your
relief
from
their
unconventional
political
remedies.
and
if
you
fail
that,
then
we
will
decide
this
ultimate
issue."
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
i
mean
as
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
that's
right.
as
to
the
extent
of
the
--
as
to
finding
that
the
population
variations
in
georgia
were
unreasonable
and
arbitrary,
that's
when
we
say
they
have
decided
the
merits.
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
they
didn't
say
it
was
unconstitutional.
you
see
--
the
district
court
did
not
go
that
far.
the
district
court
found
and
in
fact,
i
don't
think
the
district
court
had
to
go
to
the
extent
of
saying
that
the
congressional
districts
were
arbitrary
and
unreasonable.
i
think
the
district
court
could
have
said,
"well,
you
got
a
state
remedy
that's
not
yet
been
tried,
it's
available",
and
for
that
reason,
it
was
going
to
dismiss
the
want
of
equity
if
you
failed
and
comeback
and
--
and
we
may
--
and
we
will
consider
that.
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
res
judicata.
i
don't
think
we
could
argue
with
res
judicata
because
the
condition
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
sir?
oh,
i
see
what
you
mean.
when
i
was
thinking
i
mean
i
--
i
don't
think
the
state
to
take
the
position
that
the
--
that
three-judge
district
court's
decision
or
it
was
res
judicata
(inaudible)
for
filing
a
new
suit
because
one
of
the
conditions
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
rodgers
that's
right.
after
the
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
well
--
well,
i
think
in
the
new
case,
they
would
have
already
established
by
virtue
of
this
and
there
was
redistricting.
i
think
they've
relied
upon
this
case
the
holding
that
the
present
that
congressional
districting
at
that
time
was
arbitrary
and
unreasonable.
then
it
will
present
the
cause
a
legal
consideration
of
whether
or
--
or
just
how
much
this
area
is
insulated
with
congressional
power
from
judicial
review.
in
other
words,
at
that
time
this
court
determined
whether
or
not
it's
going
to
get
involved
in
this
area
to
require
strict
population
standard
or
not.
of
course
we
say
that
question
should
be
reserved
for
future
consideration
because
of
the
--
of
the
availability
of
the
state
remedy.
mr.
paul
rodgers
yes.
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
we
denied
our
answer
by
--
the
court
found
against
us
so
--
and
of
course
we're
not
--
we're
not
complaining
about
the
opinion
but
--
but
we
deny
in
our
answer
but
the
court
found
against
us
is
--
is
--
had
it
obvious.
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
we're
not
appealing
from
it.
mr.
paul
rodgers
we
say
--
we
reserve
that
question
for
future
consideration.
now,
what
we
say
this
court
should
not
try
to
resolve
such
question
there
this
time
because
of
the
availability
of
the
state
remedy.
we
say
--
this
court
should
say,
"now,
go
try
your
conventional
state
remedy."
if
that
fails,
it
come
back.
in
other
words,
we
say
this
court
should
defer
for
future
consideration
questions
of
that
nature.
in
other
words,
we
say
to
this
court
does
not
have
to
decide
the
ultimate
issues
presented
in
the
field
of
congressional
districting.
mr.
paul
rodgers
that's
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
rodgers
or
to
congress
so
that
--
if
congress
will
mind
that.
mr.
paul
rodgers
yes.
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
i
think
the
state
should
defer
to
both.
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
i
think
that
is
the
majority
opinion.
i
think
the
major
--
though,
as
i
think
that
all
three
justices
felt
like
that
the
issue
was
justiciable.
i
think
they
all
--
three
agreed
there
was
want
of
equity
in
the
petition
that
time
but
judge
tuttle
did
not
want
to
dismiss
it
because
he
wanted
to
retain
it,
to
retain
jurisdiction
and
the
other
two
felt
that
the
petition
should
be
dismissed.
mr.
paul
rodgers
that's
--
in
other
words,
i
--
we
think
that
this
court
should
afford
no
relief
until
the
conventional
political
remedy
has
been
tried
and
has
found
insufficient.
now,
as
we
say
there
should
be
no
decision
as
to
the
legal
issues
present
in
this
case
at
this
time
that
the
court
at
this
time
should
equitably
abstain
until
the
conventional
process
had
a
chance
to
operate.
if
it
--
if
for
some
reason,
the
operation
or
the
mechanism
is
defective,
then
this
court
can
then
take
the
case
and
can
then
resolve
the
ultimately
legal
issues.
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
we
say
--
we
don't
anticipate
that
congress
is
going
to
redo
it.
the
georgia
legislature
had
just
been
reconstituted.
and
the
--
the
county
--
and
the
county
unit
system
has
just
been
abolished.
and
we
--
we
say
that
it
--
that
it
dates
from
there.
now,
of
course,
we'd
be
--
we
--
we
wouldn't
have
a
leg
to
stand
on.
i
would
think
on
the
equitable
extension
doctrine
if
the
county
unit
system
was
still
in
effect
and
if
to
say,
that
i
have
been
reconstituted.
what
--
we
say
that
right
there,
is
a
--
is
what
supports
that
equitable
extension,
these
recent
events
in
georgia
--
georgia's
political
climate.
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
we
say
that
with
the
influence
of
the
governor
exerts
over
the
legislature
and
also
with
the
plan
they
have
for
congressional
redistricting,
we
feel
that
a
satisfactory
congressional
reapportionment
bill
can
be
passed
in
legislature.
this
is
a
statement
here
copied
which
had
been
large
in
the
court
and
this
is
by
appellant
wesberry
to
the
joint
congressional
redistricting
committee.
and
he
says
the
method
of
drawing
the
district
lines
without
the
remainder
of
the
state,
outside
the
metropolitan
atlanta
area,
is
a
question
which
addresses
itself
primarily
to
the
members
of
the
legislature
in
those
areas.
it
would
appear
to
me
the
most
satisfactory
result
to
be
achieved
by
changing
the
existing
district
lines
to
districts
outside
metropolitan
atlanta
area
as
little
as
possible
so
the
voters
will
not
be
confused
and
so
that
incumbent
congressmen
will
not
be
placed
to
this
advantage.
they
would
be
grouped
(inaudible)
both
citizen
voters
as
well
as
congressmen
to
change
their
districts
drastically.
so
obviously
what
appellant
wesberry
--
what
the
appellant
aims
to
stand
is
reducing
the
population
of
the
fifth
district
which
is
metropolitan
atlanta.
now,
if
they
can
call
that
up
satisfactorily
and
i
think
they
can,
then,
of
course,
some
of
these
districting
rural
areas
will
not
be
affected
except
maybe
to
smaller
extent.
then
of
course,
i
would
then
think
the
count
support
of
the
those
rural
congressmen
to
join
with
the
metropolitan
representatives,
the
majority
representatives,
both
the
senate
and
the
house
to
--
to
push
through
legislation.
of
course
that's
not
county
influence
that
the
governor
has
over
the
workings
of
the
general
assembly.
mr.
paul
rodgers
that's
right.
returning
to
the
argument,
your
honor,
we
begin
with
the
court's
--
the
constitutional
provisions
which
had
been
the
best
primary
responsibility
of
this
matter
in
the
congress.
article
i,
section
4,
clause
1
of
the
federal
constitution
provides
the
times,
places
and
manner
of
holding
elections
for
senators
and
representatives
shall
be
prescribed
in
each
state
by
the
legislature
thereof.
such
regulation
except
there's
a
place
for
the
choosing
of
senators
and
commenting
(inaudible),
hamilton
stated
it
was
intended
to
best
primarily
in
the
state
legislatures
then
ultimately
in
the
congress
a
discretionary
power
over
congressional
elections.
and
this
court
held
in
smiley
versus
holm
that
it
cannot
be
doubted
this
comprehensive
words
and
brace
authority
provide
a
complete
code
of
congressional
elections.
in
article
i,
section
5,
clause
1
of
the
federal
constitution
provided
for
each
house
should
be
the
judge
of
the
election
return
and
qualification
of
its
own
members.
and
we
feel
those
two
provisions
together
give
the
congress
ample
authority
and
undisputed
authority
to
correct
situations
of
this
kind
that
exist
in
georgia.
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
your
honor,
i
would
think
frankly
that
this
court
has
ruled
--
has
already
ruled
if
not
entirely
exclusive
because
of
its
opinion
in
koenig,
smiley
and
carol.
but
the
difference
is
the
distinction
in
those
cases
were
that
those
were
just
in
the
interpretation
of
whether
or
not
the
--
the
gubernatorial
veto
was
for
display
in
the
legislative
function
within
the
constitutional
sense.
now,
there's
a
difference
with
degree
there
between
that
and
in
a
thoroughgoing
redistricting
or
requirement
as
to
thoroughgoing
redistricting
of
the
--
of
the
congressional
district
within
a
state.
now,
that's
another
question
which
we
ask
this
court
reserve
for
future
consideration
and
that
is
the
degree
of
penetration
to
this
area
which
this
court
feels
to
be
appropriate
under
the
constitution.
i
would
not
say
it
was
wholly
exclusive
but
on
the
other
hand,
i
would
not
say
that
--
that
we
will
not
concede
the
supreme
court
had
the
authority
--
the
federal
court
had
the
authority
to
a
holding,
redistrict
a
state.
mr.
paul
rodgers
that's
correct,
your
honor.
they're
--
but
i
think,
frankly,
i'm
somewhat
surprised
the
solicitor
general
is
not
--
our
amicus
instead
of
theirs.
the
only
difference
that
we
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general
is
--
is
that
we
feel
that
the
complaint
should
be
dismissed.
i
think
we
both
agreed
that
the
legislature
should
be
given
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
to
act.
the
appellants
who
want
immediate
--
i
mean
the
appellants
are
the
only
ones
who
feel
they
should
have
immediate
relief
from
the
federal
court.
mr.
paul
rodgers
that's
correct,
sir.
we've
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
that's
correct,
sir.
it
--
it
goes
to
the
matter
of
fall,
we're
concerned
with
that
matter
of
form
but
the
appeal
is
not
really
a
matter
of
subsidy.
(inaudible)
mr.
paul
rodgers
georgia's
present
congressional
districting
statute
was
enacted
in
august
25,
1931.
the
federal
act
on
november
15,
1941,
concerning
the
apportionment
of
the
house
of
representatives
following
decennial
census
provides
in
quartet.
and
this
we
feel
that
the
court
did
this
--
the
statute
is
not
--
thus
far
been
brought
to
the
court's
attention
in
argument
or
in
the
brief,
except
in
our
brief.
but
we
view
of
the
statute
right
here
is
an
effect
or
ratification
by
congress
of
the
state
congressional
districts
because
it
begun,
it
says
--
see
and
this
is
the
decennial
reapportionment
statute
of
congress.
until
a
state
is
redistricted
in
the
manner
provided
by
the
law
thereof
as
to
any
apportionment,
the
representatives
to
which
such
state
is
entitled
under
such
apportionment
shall
be
elected
in
the
following
manner.
one,
if
there
is
no
change
in
the
number
of
representatives
which
has
none
has
not
been
for
30
years
in
georgia,
they
shall
be
elected
from
the
districts
then
prescribed
by
the
law
of
such
state.
and
if
any
of
them
were
elected
from
the
state
at
large,
they
shall
continue
to
be
so
elected.
then
the
statute
goes
on
with
several
other
alternatives.
but
we
feel
that
it's
clear
that
this
right
here
is
a
congressional
ratification
which
we
feel
is
another
element
that
should
be
considered
in
the
scale
to
whether
or
not
this
court
should
equitably
abstain
at
the
present
time.
now,
wood
versus
broom,
which
involved
the
1911
federal
congressional
reapportionment
act,
this
court
held
that
the
requirements
of
equality
among
of
--
of
population
among
the
congressional
districts,
no
longer
apply.
justices
brandeis,
stone,
roberts,
cardozo's
concurring
result
but
felt
that
the
complaint
should
be
dismissed
from
want
of
equity.
and
it's
obvious
that
the
wood
case
has
coincided
with
congressional
intent
because
there
has
been
no
effort
in
the
part
of
congress
to
alter
the
courts
there.
and
colegrove
versus
green,
this
court
was
confronted
with
a
much
more
--
with
a
much
greater
ratio
than
is
in
the
georgia
case.
in
georgia,
the
ratio
between
the
least
populated
district
and
the
most
populated
one
of
3-to-1.
in
colegrove,
the
ratio
was
9-to-1.
and
i
think
there's
one
passage
in
here
that
while
we
can
fence
about
the
--
the
legalisms
involved,
in
--
in
concerning
required
congressional
redistricting.
i
think
that
justice
frankfurter
addressed
himself
to
practical
consideration
involved
in
colgrove
when
he
makes
the
statement.
to
sustain
this
action
would
cut
very
deep
into
the
very
being
of
congress.
courts
ought
not
to
enter
this
political
thicket.
remedy
for
unfairness
in
districting
is
to
secure
state
legislature
that
will
apportion
properly
or
to
invoke
the
ample
power
of
congress
and
so
forth.
but
i
think
that
while
we
may
talk
about
status
of
the
indian
tribe
and
so
forth
and
of
foreign
affairs
and
the
court
--
the
court
is
quite
correct
in
applying
the
political
question
to
those
issues.
but
i
don't
know
of
any
issue
that
would
have
so
much
effect
on
the
congress
then
for
a
nationwide
requirement
invoked
immediately
that
all
congressional
districts
must
sustain
substantial
equal
population.
because
obviously,
that's
going
to
result
in
substantially
a
strike
from
the
changes
in
the
constituencies
of
the
various
congressmen.
and
obviously
is
going
to
produce
to
varying
extents
new
faces
in
the
congress.
we
call
this,
as
justice
frankfurter
said,
strike
to
the
very
being
of
congress
itself,
the
membership
itself.
now,
one
thing
about
the
dissent
of
justice
black
which
was
incurred
in
by
justices
douglas
and
murphy
and
we
may
be
wrong,
of
course
there
are
those
here
on
the
bench
of
course
who
know
much
more
about
that
than
i
do.
but
it
will
look
like
to
me
that
one
of
the
significant
attributes
of
that,
the
same
one
--
of
the
significant
elements
of
that
dissent
was
--
was
a
realization
that
if
this
court
did
not
grant
relief
that
they
could
get
relief
from
no
other
source.
the
dissent
says,
the
dissent
was
clearly
predicated,
but
this
is
my
claim,
the
dissent
was
clearly
predicated
upon
the
assumption,
there
was
no
likelihood
in
illinois
would
afford
relief
to
the
appellants
because
the
state
legislature
was
apportioned
in
such
a
manner
that
the
state
legislator
had
an
interest
in
perpetuating
the
complained
of
congressional
districting.
and
furthermore,
because
a
series
of
suits
previously
instituted
in
the
state
courts
challenging
the
valid
--
the
validity
of
such
districting
had
proved
ineffective.
and
to
me,
that
is
insignificant
element
of
the
dissent,
was
because
that
there
was
no
available
relief
that
the
appellants
could
gain
from
any
other
source.
i
see
my
time
is
up,
i'll
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
paul
rodgers
i
believe
yesterday,
to
summarized
briefly
yesterday
the
position
that
we
could've
sometime
state
to
the
court
was
that
we
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed
on
the
ground
of
--
on
the
grounds
of
equitable
abstention
and
that
the
decisions,
the
legal
issues
in
this
area
should
be
reserved
for
future
consideration
to
be
decided
after
state
legislatures,
had
a
full
opportunity
to
redistrict
congressional
districts
along
population
lines
and
it
only
until
such
time
should
this
court
at
that
time
of
endeavor
to
determine
the
legal
issues
within
that
area.
in
other
words,
whether
or
not
this
court
is
going
to
continue
to
abstain
from
requiring
congressional
redistricting
or
at
such
time
require
the
congressional
redistricting
to
be
performed.
now
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
it's
rather
difficult
to
tell
this
time
for
this
reason,
that
you
take
a
three-judge
district
court
in
georgia
in
toombs
versus
fortson
has
applied
the
federal
analogy
to
our
state
legislature
that
said
that
if
you
reconstitute
one
house
of
the
state
legislature
according
to
population,
that
would
satisfy
constitutional
criteria.
now,
georgia
had
done
that.
we
still
have
one
house,
the
house
of
representatives,
largely
apportioned
according
to
geography.
now,
if
this
court
should
decide
in
the
decisions
in
the
cases
that's
recently
heard
in
both
houses
to
some
extent
should
reflect
population
then
of
course
that
would
mean
that
georgia
would
again
have
to
reconstitute
the
house
of
its
legislature.
we
feel
that
--
that
we've
--
that
there
cannot
be
a
full
opportunity
for
the
state
legislature
to
reapportion
until
after
we
are
certain
that
the
georgia
general
assembly
had
been
reconstituted
along
constitutional
lines,
we
cannot
be
certain
of
that
until
after
this
court
renders
decisions
in
the
cases
it's
just
heard.
so
we'll
say
--
of
course
we
feel
that
the
general
assembly
is
going
to
redistrict
in
its
january
session
but
we'll
say,
we'll
assume
for
the
purposes
of
further
consideration
that
the
general
assembly
redistricted
but
that
the
appellants
were
not
still
satisfied
but
that
soon
after,
we'll
say
that
the
session
closed,
this
court
should
then
require
that
both
houses
of
a
legislature
be
reconstituted
along
population
lines
or
more
closely
to
population
lines.
and
georgia
would
like
--
and
have
to
reconstitute
the
house
of
representatives.
that
might
take
another
year
or
several
more
months
so
it's
difficult
to
tell,
we
ask
is
--
is
that
a
--
a
--
that
the
state
legislature,
when
it
--
when
we're
certain
that
it
has
been
constitutionally
constituted
and
had
a
full
opportunity
to
act
and
solve
this
problem
in
the
traditional
american
fashion,
then
after
that
time
had
expired
and
if
the
appellants
are
still
not
satisfied
with
how
the
congressional
districts
have
been
reconstituted,
then
they
can
come
back
to
court.
it's
difficult
to
pinpoint
any
particular
amount
of
time
your
honor,
at
this
stage
of
--
at
--
at
this
stage
of
proceeding.
this
morning
i
would
first
like
to
address
myself
to
what
we
consider
to
be
the
undesirability
of
elections
at
large.
now,
the
requirement
of
elections
at
large
is
the
course
of
mechanical
device
is
very
easy
to
apply
but
we
feel
that
the
inequity
resulting
from
elections
at
large
are
probably
worse
than
the
present
circumstances.
i
think
one
of
the
best
descriptions
as
to
the
disadvantages
of
elections
at
large
was
stated
by
judge
knowles
who
was
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
case
of
bush
versus
martin
which
was
a
texas
case
where
two
of
the
judges
in
the
three-judge
court
found
against
texas'
program
for
redistricting.
of
course,
the
court
--
justice
black
have
to
confirm
with
the
other
member
--
other
members
of
the
court
that
stayed
the
application
of
their
judgment
but
judge
knowles
stating,
“we
think
its
particularly
appropriate
to
the
georgia
case
as
well,
although
we
don't
have
as
many
cards
but
we
think
the
same
principle
would
apply.”
judge
knowles
stated,
“all
districts
are
presently
served
by
a
congressman
even
if
at
large
elections
were
held,
there's
reason
to
assume
many
people
in
those
districts
that
want
at
least
the
opportunity
to
re-elect
there
in
the
government,
congressman
in
the
at
large
elections.
but
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
congressman
from
the
thinly
populated
region
far
removed
from
the
metropolitan
area
and
known
only
in
that
district
to
get
re-nominated
or
re-elected
in
at
large
elections.
if
this
experienced
congressman
should
be
swept
out
of
office
in
an
avalanche
of
statewide
vote,
it
would
probably
be
done
none
to
their
lack
of
statewide,
it's
more
to
their
lack
of
statewide
reputation
than
to
their
qualifications
or
lack
of
them.
the
consequences,
the
inherent
unfairness
to
the
people
living
in
the
present
districts
from
not
having
a
reason
or
opportunity
to
have
their
own
congressman
reelected
is
disturbing.
and
the
consequences
to
the
entire
state
of
texas
when
the
removal
of
these
congressmen
is
threatened
not
by
the
expressed
will
of
the
people
of
texas
through
normal
political
action
but
by
the
politic
but
--
but
by
the
practical
operation
of
an
unfortunate
intervention
and
untimely
order
of
a
federal
court
is
likewise
disturbing.
the
election
of
congressman
at
large
would
call
a
far
more
serious
discrimination
and
consequences
for
people
living
outside
the
great
metropolitan
areas
and
is
even
alleged
to
exist
presently,
or
today
every
region
has
substantial
representation
by
districts,
hence,
only
claimed
present
serious
under
representation
in
a
few
areas.
at
large
elections
would
leave
many
of
the
regions
of
the
state
of
texas
and
the
people
practically
speaking
without
representation
at
all.
and
we
fear
your
honor
that
that
would
apply
not
only
in
georgia
but
in
every
other
state
that
would
have
to
suffer
elections
at
large
with
congressional
representation.
and
of
course
the
ratio
in
your
congressional
districting
case
is
a
no
or
nowhere
near
to
the
series
ratio
presented
by
state
legislature.
in
other
words,
i
understand
that
the
worst
--
alleges
that
the
worst
ratio
in
your
state
legislatures
as
i
believe
in
new
hampshire
was
--
in
new
hampshire
was
approximately
750-to-1.
i
think
the
worst
ratio
in
your
congressional
district
throughout
the
nation
is
4-to-1
but
nevertheless
if
you
require
a
strict
population
standard
in
the
apportionment
of
these
congressional
districts,
then
you
can
--
the
court
can
quickly
tell
from
the
record
that
the
vast
majority
of
the
states
of
this
nation
allow
this
if
--
if
you
use
the
population
standard,
these
standards.
we
move
on
to
equitable
abstention
doctrines
to
the
origin
with
--
in
a
more
fuller
sense.
i
think
the
first
thing
we
must
take
into
consideration
is
--
is
the
significant
political
changes
coming
to
georgia.
now,
the
call
for
georgia's
political
structure
in
the
past,
its
historic
structure
in
the
past,
georgia
was
subject
to
the
grasp
of
the
rural
areas,
probably
more
so
in
any
other
state
and
union
for
this
reason.
we
have
the
county
unit
system
that
this
court
is
well
aware
of
and
the
county
unit
system
applies
of
course
in
the
democratic
primary,
if
we
call
the
strength
and
power
of
democratic
party
of
georgia
as
the
cliché
go,
the
--
the
democratic
primary
of
successful
nominees
there
are
tantamount
to
election.
well
consequently,
the
governor
and
the
chief
officers
of
the
state,
the
chief
executive
office
of
the
state
when
nominated
by
the
rural
areas
of
the
state
of
georgia
and
consequently
they
were
elected.
so
of
course
in
georgia,
we
have
the
governor
and
the
chief
official
of
the
state
government
under
the
control
and
nomination
of
rural
areas.
now,
after
this
--
and
now
whenever
the
court
in
sanders
versus
gray
overturned
that
in
this
decision
in
large
one
was
affirmed.
of
course
that's
true
that
many
county
unit
systems
in
the
primary,
the
last
primary
in
georgia,
the
last
democratic
primary,
when
the
government
--
when
the
nominees
ran
statewide,
every
person's
vote
counted
equally
and
of
course
that
gave
full
weight
to
the
metropolitan
areas.
so
we
say
in
the
courts,
by
virtue
of
that,
we've
had
a
modern
elected
as
governor
of
georgia,
this
court
knows
governor
carl
sanders
which
of
course
is
the
significant
and
substantial
political
difference
between
governor
carl
sanders
and
one
of
our
past
governors
marvin
griffin.
they
present
two
different
approaches
in
polity
and
i
think
the
court
can
really
recognize
the
contrast.
but
the
overwhelming
defeat
of
governor
marvin
griffin
by
governor
carl
sanders
indicates,
we
think
dramatically,
the
change
has
come
to
georgia
politics
just
by
the
elimination
of
the
county
unit
system.
it's
also
quite
clear
in
georgia
that
the
governor
as
it
is
in
many
states
has
a
tremendous
amount
of
influence
and
power
over
the
workings
of
the
state
legislature.
he
exert
substantial
power
there
and
we
have
that
now,
a
governor
who
is
of
course
it
has
to
be
amenable
and
of
course
is
susceptible
to
where
--
to
the
popular
feelings
of
the
metropolitan
areas
of
the
state.
and
of
course
we
also
have
the
case
of
toombs
versus
fortson
which
required
the
reapportionment
of
our
state's
senate.
that
case
is
still
pending.
i
do
not
know
why
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
did
not
appeal
to
this
court
but
they
asked
in
their
--
in
their
complaint
that
both
houses
with
state
legislature
be
reapportioned
according
to
population.
the
court
only
granted
their
complaint
halfway.
that
case
is
still
pending
and
of
course
if
this
court
requires
to
both
houses'
legislature
be
reconstituted
at
large
along
population
lines,
then
of
course
the
district
court
can
move
very
quickly
on
that.
so
we
may
yet
have
to
--
we
don't
know
what
the
courts
want
to
determine
but
it's
quite
possible,
the
majority
voice
in
georgia
which
we
think
is
already
strong
is
even
going
to
get
stronger
in
the
near
future.
now,
we
believe
that
these
considerations
are
important
and
if
they
call
for
the
application
of
the
equitable
abstention
doctrine
called
just
before
a
year
--
a
year
and
a
half
ago,
georgia
had
the
--
the
majority
control
in
georgia
had
no
practical
opportunities
for
exerting
their
will,
as
far
as
state
government
is
concerned.
now,
in
this
apparent
session
of
the
legislature
and
of
course
the
appellants
made
quite
some
reference
to
this
in
their
brief.
the
appellant
wesberry,
who
is
a
state
senator,
introduced
senate
bill
no.
101
for
the
redistricting
of
georgia's
congressional
districts.
but
either
the
gravity
of
the
major
coupled
with
insufficient
time
of
appropriate
study,
the
bill
did
not
pass
that
session
but
was
referred
to
the
rule
committee
of
the
senate
where
it's
still
pending
for
further
action.
the
bill
is
not
dead,
it
did
not
die
in
the
last
session,
it's
still
pending.
now,
i
doubt
here
that
the
bill
is
going
to
pass
and
i
will
--
will
come
to
that
in
the
next
few
minutes.
next,
senator
julian
webb
introduced
senate
resolution
no.
56
for
the
creation
of
a
joint
center
house
committee
to
study
congressional
redistricting
which
was
passed
by
the
senate
but
was
reported
--
unfavored
by
the
house,
that
bill
was
not
passed.
however,
this
should
not
end
all
attempts
that
reapportioned
that
session
of
the
general
assembly,
stated
by
the
appellants
in
their
brief
because
senator
webb
then
introduced
senate
resolution
no.
129
for
the
authorization
of
interim
senate
committee
to
study
congressional
redistricting
and
reported
recommendation
and
study
the
1964
regular
session
of
the
general
assembly.
this
resolution
was
adopted
march
15th,
1963.
mr.
paul
rodgers
not
yet.
now,
in
july
1963,
the
joint
congressional
redistricting
study
committee
was
created
by
the
president,
and
was
then
appointing
--
appointing
ten
senators,
one
from
each
congressional
district
and
a
speaker
of
the
house
appointed
ten
representatives,
one
from
each
congressional
district.
now
of
course,
that
was
done
sooner
after
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
which
i
believe
was
in
june
of
1963.
senator
julian
webb
was
made
chairman
of
this
committee.
now
we
think
that's
significant
because
senator
webb
who
was
working
to
get
reapportioned
congressional
districts
before
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction,
he
--
he
at
that
time
was
working
for
as
the
chairman
of
that
committee
so
i
think
that
right
there
is
an
element
which
demonstrates
the
good
faith
that
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
is
putting
into
this
effort.
now,
it's
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
the
committee
is
working
in
good
faith
and
the
governor
of
the
state
is
going
to
support
any
fair
and
equitable
redistricting
plan
that's
presented.
now,
it's
interesting
to
note
that
appellant
wesberry,
now
of
course
he
introduced
senate
bill
101.
however,
he
admitted
in
his
statement
of
september
17,
1963,
following
the
joint
congressional
redistricting
study
committee.
and
this
is
what
he
had
to
say
about
his
own
bill.
he
says,
“i
made
it
clear
and
i
do
not
think
that
senate
bill
101
should
be
passed
as
introduced
but
that
it
should
undoubtedly
drastically
changed
to
meet
with
the
approval
of
all
citizens
of
georgia.”
and
he
goes
on
to
say,
“i
believe
it
includes
some
good
suggestions
and
i
know
it
includes
some
bad
ones,
so
even
if
the
author
of
the
bill
admits
that
the
bill
was
not
good,
that
he'd
be
drastically
and
meant
it
weren't
to
be
passed.”
the
point
is,
we
do
not
believe
that
georgia
--
the
general
assembly
in
georgia
yet
have
an
adequate
bill
to
set
or
a
fair
opportunity
to
redistrict
its
congressional
districts.
now
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
the
only
difference
we
had
have
with
judge
tuttle's
decision
on
the
claim
was,
first,
we
believe
that
just
out
of
considerations
of
comity,
the
complaint
should
be
dismissed.
also
judge
tuttle
would
probably
felt
like
they
should
go
ahead
and
resolve
the
ultimate
considerations
as
errors,
legal
considerations.
we
feel
the
consideration
of
legal
issues
should
be
deferred
until
georgia
has
failed
to
redistrict.
in
other
words,
we
feel
that
nothing
more
should
be
done
at
this
time
than
to
apply
the
doctrine
of
equitable
abstention,
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
be
affirmed
and
after
a
reasonable
time,
if
they're
not
satisfied
they
can
re-file
their
case
which
we
feel
is
required
out
of
considerations
of
the
comity
for
the
workings
of
our
federalism.
now,
of
course,
we
won't
go
into
these
cases
extensively.
they
are
cited
in
the
brief.
of
course,
this
court
long
held
in
its
--
and
it's
frequently
applied
the
doctrine
of
stating
great
lakes
dredge
&
dock
company
versus
hoffman
which
construed
and
considered
the
federal
declaratory
judgments
act
which
held
that
the
same
considerations
of
equitable
abstention
applied
and
appropriate
cases
applied
elsewhere
in
the
area
of
federal
adjudication.
and
of
course
we
feel
the
same
thing
applies
here.
now,
in
one
of
the
previous
cases,
the
--
the
solicitor
general
as
he
pointed,
“there's
no
room
for
the
doctrine
of
equitable
abstention
in
the
--
in
enforcing
rights
under
the
civil
rights
act.”
we
feel
that
that
position
is
fatally
fallacious
because
we
feel
i
would
think
that
any
member
of
this
court
can
conjure
up
circumstances
where
equitable
abstention
should
be
applied
in
the
--
in
the
construction
of
constitutional
rights
or
in
the
construction
of
any
federal
statute.
also,
the
court
has
recently
applied
in
1959
in
--
in
the
case
of
martin
versus
creasy
and
harrison
versus
naacp,
all
of
which
is
cited
in
the
brief.
it's
given
other
examples
there
over
the
application
of
doctrine
of
equitable
abstention.
now,
a
valid
conception
of
baker
versus
carr,
that
baker
versus
carr
was
an
emergency
measure
that
it
was
--
that
baker
versus
carr
was
an
effort
to
--
to
restore
the
democratic
workings
of
the
state
legislature
that
would
take
and
after
a
great
deal
of
consideration,
i
believe
the
case
pending
here
for
two
years.
it
was
taken
after
it
seemed
to
me
obvious
reluctant
but
as
the
court
felt
that
it
was
faced
with
no
other
alternative
but
intervene
this
area
in
order
to
rescue
the
workings
of
democracy
in
the
state
legislature.
and
we
think
that
justice
clark
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
baker
versus
carr
put
his
finger
upon
the
fundamental
point
of
baker
versus
carr
when
he
stated,
“although
i
find
the
tennessee
of
apportionment
statute
offend
the
equal
protection
clause,
i
would
not
consider
intervention
by
this
court
in
a
so
delicate
appeal,
if
there
were
any
other
relief
available
to
the
people
of
tennessee.”
but
the
majority
of
the
people
of
tennessee
have
no
practical
opportunity
for
exerting
their
political
way
of
the
problems
to
correct
the
existing
invidious
discrimination.
tennessee
has
no
initiative
in
referendum.
i
have
searched
diligently
for
other
practical
opinions
present
under
law,
i
find
none
other
than
through
the
federal
courts.
and
we
think
that
this
case
here
which
involves
the
second
stage
area
of
congression.
this
should
be
involved
second
stage
is
the
far
cry
from
that
presented
by
the
first
state
which
is
the
state
legislature.
we
call
to
think
it's
quite
clear
that
the
state
legislature
when
they
are
--
are
--
are
--
are
switched
to
the
control
of
majority
are
going
to
provide
the
relief
that
many
seek
in
the
area
of
congressional
districting.
but
we
think
the
restoration
of
the
democratic
process
has
placed
georgia's
political
destiny
in
the
hands
of
the
majority.
now,
the
appellants
made
one
allegation
there,
complained
with
paragraph
14.
we
think
it
was
a
necessary
allegation
to
their
complaint
but
it's
--
it's
in
fact
a
--
a
very
important
one
to
their
complaint
but
which
is
by
virtue
of
the
restructuring
of
georgia's
political
system,
has
lost
all
vitality.
this
is
what
paragraph
14
of
the
appellant's
complaint
state.
it's
--
and
these
--
these
words
right
here
were
written
prior
to
the
political
restructuring
of
georgia,
i
think
in
april
of
1962.
today,
all
attempts
by
the
informed
civically
and
militant
electorate
and
arouse
public
to
have
the
general
assembly
to
reapportion
the
congressional
election
districts
so
as
to
move
--
so
as
to
more
nearly
equalize
the
population
has
been
without
itself
a
contributing,
if
not
be
called
of
this
situation
is
the
fact
that
state
legislature
has
chosen
on
the
basis
of
state
election
subdivision
inequitably
apportioned
in
a
way
similar
to
those
with
congressional
districts.
that
the
issues
stating
congressional
apportionment,
thus,
so
interdependent
and
interrelated
that
it
is
to
--
that
it
is
to
the
interest
of
the
state
legislature
to
perpetuate
in
equitable
apportionment
of
both
state
and
congressional
election
districts.
consequently,
there
are
no
practical
opportunities
that
the
plaintiff
and
the
people
of
georgia
for
exerting
their
political
way
proposed.
georgia
has
no
initiative
and
referendum,
so
therefore,
we
say
another,
a
--
a
recognition
of
the
point
made
by
justice
clark
and
the
court
there
showed
right
in
the
complaint
that
the
solution
to
this
problem
is
related
to
the
--
to
the
structure
of
the
state
legislature.
now,
one
other
point
that
we
think
is
particularly
good
and
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
no
sir,
not
at
all.
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
that
gets
back
to
the
statement
we
read
yesterday
from
the
senator
wesberry,
the
papers
he
filed
when
the
election
law
--
i
mean
with
the
joint
congressional
study
committee.
senator
wesberry's
decision,
i
think
it's
a
practical
one
of
is,
is
that
the
way
to
solve
this
redistricting
problem
as
far
as
he's
concerned
is
to
redraw
the
districting
lines
around
metropolitan
atlanta,
the
fifth
district.
and
that
if
you
do
that,
that
would
solve
the
situation.
now,
but
you
see,
in
--
in
redrawing
the
district
lines
in
that
way,
that
would
leave
many
of
your
rural
districts,
either
not
changed
or
only
slightly
altered.
and
of
course
with
such
a
system
as
that,
you
could
i
think
depend
not
only
upon
your
--
your
metropolitan
support
in
the
house
of
representatives
which
is
not
controlling
but
it's
abstention
because
of
321
tier
and
also
i
think
they
could
stand
upon
the
support
of
many
rural
representatives
who
would
i
think
would
have
a
built-in
in
senate
to
support
the
plan
because
they
feel
like
that
they
could
preserve
their
districting
unimpaired
or
salvages
substantial
part
of
--
so
i
think
it's
worth
serving
to
your
trial
on
the
court.
on
top
of
that,
as
an
overlay
on
top
of
that,
you
have
got
the
prestige
and
influence
of
the
governor
operating
on
the
house
of
representatives.
so
we
feel
like
that
there's
a
very
good
chance
that
the
general
assembly
is
presently
constituted
going
to
redistrict.
certainly,
it
should
be
tried
and
of
course
this
court
should
certainly
assume
that
a
state
legislature
is
in
good
faith
going
to
perform
its
duty.
and
of
course,
if
--
if
we
should
have
to
reconstitute
the
house
according
to
our
contention
is
that
the
general
assembly
of
georgia,
i
believe
would
constitute
now,
but
if
we
should
have
to
reconstitute
it
would
make
it
that
much
easier.
now,
in
the
--
in
the
first
brief,
in
the
first
amicus
curiae
brief
found
in
baker
versus
carr,
the
solicitor
general
we
thought
made
some
very
fine
comments.
this
is
from
the
solicitor
general's
amicus
brief
of
may
14,
1961,
found
in
baker
versus
carr.
and
we
think
the
solicitor
general
then
gave
a
much
better
perspective
to
this
situation
than
he
--
than
he
gave
in
his
present
brief.
on
page
15
of
his
brief,
he
state,
“congressional
malapportionment
is
clearly
related
to
reappointment
of
state
legislatures
or
legislature
with
full
urban
representation
is
unlikely
to
challenge
malapportionment
of
congressional
districts,
discriminating
against
urban
vote.”
now,
he
wanted
to
emphasize
that
statement
so
much,
he
put
it
again
on
page
58
of
his
brief.
on
page
51
of
his
brief,
the
solicitor
general
stated,
“in
addition,
malapportionment
state
legislatures
to
the
basic
calls
of
congressional
malapportionment.
since
urban
voters
are
unrepresented
in
the
state
legislature,
there
is
little
likelihood
the
legislature
will
reapportion
congressional
districts
to
give
urban
voters
their
fair
represent
--
their
fair
proportion
of
representation
to
congress.
as
a
result,
urban
voters
are
discriminated
against
both
from
the
federal
house
of
representatives
and
in
their
own
state
legislature
not
have
--
and
have
no
remedy
in
either
body.”
now,
on
page
68,
the
solicitor
general
made
a
particularly
good
statement,
which
i
think
juxtaposed
to
this
case.
it
--
the
--
there,
solicitor
general
addressed
to
himself
to
the
question
of
whether
the
state
or
for
the
people
and
other
reasonable
remedy
here
would
effect
that
would
have
upon
the
action
of
this
court
say
in
baker
versus
carr,
and
i
assume
to
any
reapportionment
case.
the
solicitor
general
answered
that
question
this
way,
“even
if
the
malapportionment
is
gross,
it
may
well
not
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
if
the
state
unlike
tennessee
afford
its
people
an
alternative
remedy.
for
example,
the
majority
cannot
complain
too
seriously
about
the
underrepresentation
of
the
state
legislature
in
a
state
which
provides
for
referenda
initiated
by
a
reasonable
number
of
voters.
under
such
a
system,
the
majority
can
reapportion
the
legislature
itself.”
and
he
goes
on
to
state,
“but
if
the
state
provides
a
feasible
political
remedy,
it
might
be
concluded
the
state
has
not
been
so
arbitrary
as
to
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.”
and
i
think
that
brings
us
to
basic
philosophic
consideration
to
this
court,
although
it's
unnecessary
for
this
court
to
reach
that
day
on
these
cases
but
that
courts
will
have
to
reach
eventually,
and
that
is
what
this
court
is
going
to
do
in
the
case
that
whether
majority
has
control
of
the
state
legislature
to
state
political
process
but
through
less
--
but
through
lethargy
is
not
exercised
in
their
control.
if
the
court
then
you
won't
go
a
step
further
and
carry
the
majority
towards
its
goal
or
that
this
court
won't
require
the
majority
in
the
traditional
american
fashion
to
carry
itself,
fall
on
its
own
momentum
and
not
stand
up
on
a
federal
court.
that's
another
consideration
which
i
believe
this
court
should
keep
in
mind,
although
it
doesn't
have
to
be
decided
this
time.
now,
we
say
we
believe
it
has
been
restored
of
the
power
of
political
persuasion
had
been
restored
to
minor
--
to
the
majority
in
georgia.
and
also,
we
--
we
think
the
record
demonstrates
very
clear
that
the
whole
nation
is
now
districted.and
this
court
would
render
decision
like
the
appellant
wan.
it
would
come
down
at
early
part
of
next
year.
you
can
depend
upon
the
district
courts
to
quickly
apply
that
decisions
in
baker
versus
carr
and
you're
going
to
have
redistricting
suits
across
the
nation,
at
large
election.
it's
going
to
create
a
traumatic
shock
on
congress
unparalleled
in
history,
whereas
to
this
court
it
will
abstain
to
this
time
the
leave
their
work
to
reapportioned
state
legislatures,
the
correction
of
congressional
districting
will
come
from
the
position
it
sought.
and
of
course,
this
--
it
--
it
will
--
will
not
be
--
it
will
be
a
little
more
gradual,
we
don't
think
unduly
so
than
it
would
be
to
bring
it
about
by
federal
or
judicial
decree.
now,
we
think
that
--
that
as
we
--
as
we
pointed
that
the
remedy
is
political,
we
think
that
the
words
of
justice
douglas.
and
(inaudible)
--
the
judges
on
particularly
i
propose.
on
page
56,
justice
douglas
stated,
“political
actions
and
other
method
of
deciding
certain
controversies,
not
all
the
victories
for
human
rights
have
been
won
in
the
courts.
in
the
western
world,
more
such
victories
have
probably
been
won
in
constitutional
conventions,
on
legislative
halls
than
in
courts
of
law.
the
remedy
for
unwise
improvident
legislation
is
i
suppose
political
action
is
indeed
a
birth
to
a
remedy
for
the
correction
of
injustices.”
and
then
justice
douglas
goes
on
to
state
on
page
56,
“litigation
is
not
the
cure
or
the
solution
for
every
conflict.
if
all
our
disputes
and
differences
had
to
go
to
the
courts,
we
would
indeed
be
bulked
down
in
time-consuming
wasteful
procedures.
the
importance
of
the
courts
are
necessarily
low
as
litigation
serves
only
a
limited
function.
rule
must
be
left
for
the
workings
of
other
conciliatory,
mediating
and
directive
influences.”
and
then
of
course
that
was
reechoed,
those
sentiments
were
reechoed
to
a
largely
inspiring
in
principle
by
justice
douglas
in
his
--
when
he
wrote
to
majority's
any
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
williamson
versus
lee
optical
of
oklahoma.
and
we
feel
that
in
minersville
school
district
versus
gobitis
that
justice
frankfurter
also
states
the
principle
very
well
when
he
said,
“judicial
review
itself,
a
limitation
on
popular
government
is
a
fundamental
part
of
our
constitutional
scheme.
but
to
the
legislature,
no
less
than
to
the
court
is
committed
to
guardianship
of
deeply
cherished
american
liberty.
where
all
of
the
effective
means
of
inducing
political
changes
left
free
from
interference,
education
and
the
abandonment
of
foolish
legislation
is
itself
a
training
in
liberty
to
fight
out
the
wide
use
of
legislative
authority
in
the
form
of
public
opinion
and
before
legislative
assembly
rather
than
to
transfer
of
such
a
contest
to
the
--
to
the
judicial
arena,
serve
to
vindicate
the
self-confidence
of
a
free
people.”
so
your
honors,
in
conclusion,
we
say
that
we
believe
that
the
appellant
misconceived
baker
versus
carr.
we
believe
that
baker
versus
carr
was
right
in
a
time
of
great
internal
crisis
to
american
democracy.
it
was
rendered
in
time
where
there
was
no
other
remedy
in
tennessee
and
the
tennessee
court.
of
course
the
--
in
georgia,
the
court
--
the
state
court
have
not,
yet
can
try.
we
feel
that
the
legislative
remedy
is
more
likely.
however,
the
state
courts
could
afford
the
remedy
because
they
have
baker
versus
carr
to
guide
them.
but
it
was
right
in
the
time
where
in
tennessee,
there
was
no
other
remedy
as
it
was
in
the
vast
majority
of
the
state
to
this
nation.
it
was
an
emergency
measure,
and
we
feel
it
meant
to
be
used
sparingly.
i
think
that
the
court's
intention
in
baker
versus
carr
was
not
try
to
takeover
basically,
a
classic
political
or
legislative
decisions,
it
was
the
--
the
intention
of
this
court
in
baker
versus
carr,
to
try
and
to
get
the
democratic
process
restored
so
that
at
least
that
the
legislatures
themselves
could
make
these
decisions.
and
i
don't
think
the
court
has
any
desire
to
make
these
decisions.
it
was
designed,
we
believe,
baker
versus
carr
was
to
strengthen
the
state
legislatures
and
not
to
weaken
it,
but
it
was
designed
to
restore
the
democratic
process,
not
to
impair
it.
and
it
was
designed
to
repair
the
main
spring
of
representative
government
not
to
operate
it,
designed
to
make
the
state
legislatures
and
the
citizenry
of
this
nation
more
responsible,
not
less
responsible
by
casting
their
obligations
on
the
federal
court.
i
think
the
appellants
--
the
appellants,
we
get
as
the
declaration
of
independence,
the
constitution
and
the
bill
of
rights
were
brought
forth
by
the
liberty
of
bodies
and
not
by
a
court.
they
were
brought
forward
by
liberty
of
bodies
by
militants
and
arouse
citizenry,
and
that
is
of
course
is
what
kept
this
country
going
thus
far
in
its
history.
and
if
we're
going
to
preserve
this
country,
we've
got
to
depend
to
that
kind
of
citizenry
and
not
an
advocation
to
the
federal
court.
we
believe
that
when
the
government
has
accepted
the
majority
rules,
it
is
in
georgia
and
it's
clearly
as
it
will
be,
and
if
it's
not
already
that
--
it's
--
that
the
situation
or
the
solution
must
be
brought
about
by
the
citizenry,
by
letter
writing
campaigns,
by
demonstrations,
by
delegations,
by
petitions
and
by
other
forms
of
public
protests.
otherwise,
if
you
do
not
leave
and
otherwise
it
is
implied
to
clear
implication
that
--
it
is
that
the
citizenry
is
definite
on
appeal.
and
we
believe
that
under
such
circumstances,
citizens
and
particularly
state
senators
are
under
a
plain
obligation
to
work
toward
solving
their
problem
to
the
state
legislative
process
rather
than
attempt
to
advocate
their
responsibility
to
the
federal
courts.
in
baker
versus
carr,
this
court
slashed
the
gordian
knot
of
american
politics.
this
court
guaranteed
the
majority's
rightful
place
in
the
state
legislatures.
in
georgia,
the
power
of
political
persuasion
has
been
restored
to
the
hands
of
the
majority
and
we
say
it's
not
up
to
the
majority
in
georgia
to
accomplish
its
goals
through
conventional
political
means.
in
conclusion,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed
on
the
grounds
of
equitable
abstention.
thank
you
for
your
attention.
