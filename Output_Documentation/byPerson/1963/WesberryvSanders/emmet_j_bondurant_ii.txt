mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
before
proceeding
into
our
case,
i
would
like
to
respectfully
move
the
court
to
permit
my
associate,
mr.
frank
t.
cash
to
appear
pro
hac
vice
for
purposes
of
this
case
and
this
case
alone.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
thank
you,
sir.
this
case,
unlike
the
cases
previously
before
the
court
during
the
preceding
week,
presents
not
questions
involving
legislative
apportionments
of
the
states
but
questions
involving
profound
issues
affecting
the
structure
of
our
national
government
for
it
involves
the
structure
of
the
house
of
representatives.
it
was
the
house
of
representatives
which
was
to
be
in
the
words
of
george
mason,
the
grand
depository
of
democratic
principle.
indeed,
here
lies
the
principle
upon
which
all
republican
government
is
founded
for
by
assuring
equality
of
political
participation
to
its
citizens.
the
government
secured
not
only
the
strength
of
popular
support
but
it
assured
to
each
of
its
citizens
the
attentive
consideration
of
his
rights
by
those
in
power
to
the
end
the
government
would
be
responsive
to
the
will
of
the
people.
yet,
this
basic
principle
upon
which
an
important
branch
of
our
federal
--
federal
government
is
founded
has
been
undermined
by
the
repeated
failure
of
the
states
to
properly
apportion
their
congressional
districts.
this
case
presents
in
bold
relief
the
very
clear
question
of
whether
a
state
may
deprive
its
citizens
of
more
than
half
their
representation
in
the
house
of
representatives
by
their
failure
to
properly
apportion
congressional
districts
long
after
massive
shifts
and
population
have
deprived
these
districts
of
their
representativeness.
this
case,
your
honors,
was
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
georgia
by
two
residents
of
fulton
county,
georgia
for
practical
purposes,
atlanta,
who
are
qualified
to
vote
for
representatives
in
congress
from
the
fifth
congressional
district
of
georgia.
in
1932,
georgia,
following
the
census
of
1930,
lost
two
of
its
delegates
in
the
house
of
representatives
having
its
apportionment
reduced
from
12
to
10
representatives.
this
necessitate
of
course
a
reapportionment
of
the
georgia
congressional
districts
which
was
done
under
the
act
of
1931.
this
act
which
is
quoted
at
length
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
in
which
the
statistics
of
which
are
set
forth
fully
in
the
brief
apportioned
georgia's
10
congressional
districts
throughout
the
state.
the
largest,
fulton
county,
was
roughly
about
80%
larger
than
the
smallest
district
created
under
the
act
of
1930.
it
is
noteworthy
that
the
district
court
seemed
to
find
in
this
apportionment
a
not
--
unreasonable
deviation
from
popu
--
population.
however,
in
the
30
intervening
years
since
the
apportionment
of
1931,
the
act
has
lost
all
contact
with
reality
because
of
massive
population
shifts
which
have
occurred
in
georgia
principally
in
her
fifth
congressional
district,
metropolitan
atlanta
which
is
seen
an
--
toward
growth
during
that
period
of
time.
in
1960,
based
on
the
population
figures
of
the
1960
census,
the
fifth
congressional
district
of
georgia
was
more
than
three
times
the
size
of
the
smallest
congressional
district
in
georgia,
the
ninth
district
with
the
exception
of
only
one
possible
combination
of
congressional
districts,
georgia's
fifth
district,
is
larger
than
two
--
any
other
two
congressional
districts
in
the
entire
state.
the
556,000
people
residing
in
the
eighth
and
ninth
congressional
districts
of
georgia
possessed
two
representatives.
yet
in
more
than
823,000
people
residing
in
metropolitan
atlanta,
the
fifth
congressional
district,
had
only
one
representative
in
the
house
of
representatives.
this,
we
submit,
is
the
crux
of
our
case.
it
sets
forth
a
clear
violation
not
only
of
equal
protection
which
is
applicable
to
state
legislative
apportionment
but
it
violates
even
more
fundamentally
the
standards
set
forth
in
article
i,
section
2
of
the
constitution
and
as
applied
to
the
states
through
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
at
the
time
of
the
decision
in
the
district
court,
the
fifth
congressional
district
of
georgia
was
the
second
most
underrepresented
congressional
district
in
the
whole
united
states
out
of
435
districts
both
from
the
point
of
view
of
population
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
percentage
of
deviation
from
statewide
average
districts.
it
was
exceeded
only
by
the
fifth
congressional
district
of
texas,
the
dallas
district
which
is
since
been
held
unconstitutional,
the
texas
districting
system
by
the
united
states
district
court
in
texas
in
bush
v.
martin
on
october
19,
1963.
this
court,
parenthetically,
it
may
be
noted,
has
granted
a
stay
in
that
proceeding.it
is
also
important
to
note
that
the
district
court
in
ruling
upon
the
claims
presented
by
the
appellants
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
and
under
the
equal
protection
clause
clearly
decided
the
merits
of
this
claim
contrary
to
the
suggestion
made
by
the
solicitor
general
in
this
case,
for
the
district
court
said
that
it
found
the
facts
not
in
dispute
and
that
the
facts
were
adequate
to
reach
the
merits
of
the
case.
the
district
court
itself
felt
that
it
was
reaching
the
merits.
after
reviewing
ex
--
extensively
the
facts
set
forth
in
the
case,
the
district
court
concluded
that
it
did
not
find
the
proscribed
invidiousness
either
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
all
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
rights
asserted
under
article
i,
section
2.
as
an
alternative
ground
to
that
decision,
the
majority
of
the
district
court
concurred
in
only
by
two
justices
--
judges
went
on
and
said
that
it
felt
that
the
relief
should
be
denied
for
what
it
called
"want
of
equity".
it
is
clear
that
in
attaching
the
want
of
equity
labeled
to
the
case
presented
by
the
appellants
that
it
was
merely
restating
the
political
question
doctrine
of
justiciability
set
forth
by
justice
frankfurter
in
colegrove
v.
green.
it
merely
changed
the
label
because
it
said
and
quoted
at
length
that
portion
of
colegrove
in
which
justice
frankfurter
had
said,
"this
matter
is
exclusively
committed
to
another
branch
of
the
government,
congress
under
article
i,
section
2
and
article
i,
section
4
and
article
i,
section
5."
the
court
relied
on
this
and
relied
on
what
it
considered
the
preservative
treatment
given
this
rationale
in
colegrove
by
this
court
in
gomillion
v.
lightfoot
and
baker
and
carr
is
the
basis
for
its
alternative
holding.
but
nevertheless,
before
reaching
this
point,
the
court
decided
the
merits
of
the
case.
additionally,
it
might
be
pointed
out
that
even
if
the
government
were
correct
in
its
assumption
that
the
court
really
didn't
quite
decide
the
merits,
they
are
here
with
no
reasons
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
district
court.
the
facts,
as
the
lower
court
observed,
are
undisputed.
there
are
no
factual
conflicts
to
be
drawn
by
this
court
or
to
be
left
to
the
district
court.
there
are
here
no
real
local
factors
to
be
considered
as
to
which
the
expertise
of
the
local
court
on
the
scene
might
be
advantageous
as
might
exist
in
the
state
legislative
apportionment
cases
because
here,
we're
dealing
with
a
federal
standard,
the
right
to
equal
representation
in
the
house
of
representatives,
the
national
legislature.
it
is
clear
from
a
consideration
of
the
constitutional
history
from
our
country,
we
submit,
that
the
right
to
equal
popular
representation
in
the
national
legislature
in
the
house
of
representatives
is
well
established.
it
begins
with
the
declaration
of
independence,
the
declaration
that
all
men
are
created
equal.
it
is
particularly
interesting
to
note
that
in
the
declaration
of
independence
itself,
one
of
the
prime
grievances
of
which
the
colonies
then
complain,
was
the
fact
that
george
iii
would
not
provide
legislation
for
large
bodies
of
people
unless
they
would
give
up
the
right
to
representation
in
the
legislature,
a
right
in
es
--
in
(inaudible)
to
them
and
formidable
to
parents
only.
it
is
clear
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
themselves
felt
that
this
was
a
fundamental
right
of
our
republic.
the
record
of
the
federal
convention
shows
it's
very
clear
that
while
primary
attention
was
directed
toward
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
in
the
entire
legislature,
the
entire
national
legislature
there
would
be
equal
popular
representation.
the
language
is
strongly
appropriate
to
the
house
of
representatives
for
there
the
large
states
prevailed
and
it
is
their
language
which
is
deemed
controlling
as
to
the
intent
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
in
apportioning
the
national
legislature.
the
language
which
stay
on
top
is
appropriate
for
this
purpose
for
it
confers
representation
upon
the
people,
not
the
city
people,
not
the
country
people,
not
those
in
power,
not
those
not
in
power
but
the
people
of
the
state.
it
is
important
also
to
point
out
at
this
point
that
the
right
which
the
appellants
assert,
the
right
to
equal
representation
in
the
house
of
representatives,
the
federal
congress,
is
one
derived
solely
from
article
i,
section
2
which
confers
representation
on
the
people.
it
is
not
depended
upon.
it
is
not
derived
from
the
guarantee
clause
of
article
i,
article
iv,
section
4
which
relates
to
the
right
of
state
governments
to
be
republican
in
form.
it
is
an
article
i,
section
2
right.
it
is
reinforced,
of
course,
by
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
continues,
as
we
consider
it,
the
right
of
equality
of
political
representation
and
the
right
to
equality
of
political
participation
of
the
people
but
equal
protection
clause
merely
reinforced
this
right.
it
did
not
create
it.
it
was
antecedent
to
it
in
article
i,
section
2.
this,
i
think,
is
a
major
distinguishing
factor
between
the
case
which
is
presented
by
the
appellants
and
that
which
is
presented
by
the
state
legislative
apportionment
cases
for
it
is
the
constitution
which
establishes
a
right
to
equal
popular
representation
in
the
house
of
representatives.
it
is
clear
also
from
the
finding
of
the
district
court
that
the
district
court
considered
under
the
established
standards
of
constitutional
adjudication
the
apportionment
of
georgia
congressional
districts
to
violate
what
we
would've
called
the
"traditional
equal
protection
test".
the
district
court
did
not
so
conclude
it
but
for
reasons
not
based
on
findings
of
fact.
as
a
fact,
the
district
court
found
that
it
was
clear
by
any
standard
that
the
population
of
the
fifth
district
was
"grossly
out
of
balance"
with
that
of
the
georgia
congressional
districts.
the
court
later
said
in
its
opinion
that
the
plaintiffs,
not
unlike
many
other
citizens
in
our
republic
are
being
deprived
of
equal
treatment
arising
from
the
excess
in
population
of
their
congressional
district
as
compared
with
the
other
congressional
districts
in
georgia.
and
finally
and
probably,
the
most
pervasive
statement
of
the
unconstitutionality
and
the
unconscionability
of
the
georgia
congressional
districts
is
the
concluding
statement
that
the
georgia
congressional
districts
now
reflect
a
system
which
has
become
arbitrary
through
inaction
when
considered
in
the
light
of
the
present
population
of
the
fifth
district
and
is
measured
by
any
conceivable
reasonable
standard.
no
clear
violation
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
as
defined
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
could
be
set
forth.
as
a
matter
of
factual
finding
in
the
district
court
for
reasons
that
are
not
apparent,
the
majority
of
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
system
was
not
invidious,
whatever
invidious
meant
to
them.
it
is
clear
however,
that
invidious
is
defined
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
particularly
the
decision
by
this
court
in
morey
v.
doud
in
which
this
court
summarizes
the
standards
applicable
to
invidious
discrimination
that
is
clear
that
if
the
system
is
arbitrary,
if
it
is
without
a
reasonable
conceivable
basis,
then
it
does
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
and
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
is
just
clearly
wrong
on
that
point.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
that
is
correct,
justice
stewart.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
it
was
implicitly
repealed
at
this
court's
decision
in
wood
v.
broom
is
still
authoritative
in
1929
by
the
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
--
failure
of
the
congress
to
include
these
limitations
in
the
act
of
1929.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
in
about
18
--
my
date
is
not
exactly
correct.
it
has
similar
language
in
about
1872,
i
think,
under
the
apportionment.
the
history
of
apportionment
is
traced
rather
extensively
in
the
opinion
with
the
--
as
i
recall,
there
was
similar
language
in
an
early
apportionment
act
but
it
--
it
had
never
been
enforced
by
the
congress
either
through
refusal
to
see
or
by
affirmative
districting
on
its
part
under
article
i,
section
4
or
section
5.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
although
there
was
a
question
raised
in
1842,
i
understand
there
is
no
question
it
seems
to
me.
it
is
clear
under
article
i,
section
4,
congress
could
provide
districts
but
we
would
submit
although
we
need
not
reach
this
point.
it
could
only
do
so
consistent
with
the
underlying
constitutional
standard
of
the
right
to
equal
representation
in
the
popular
house
of
the
national
legislature.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
stewart.
it
would
be
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
it
is
a
mere
restatement
of
what
we
conceived
to
be
the
underlying
fundamental
constitutional
principles
which
has
been
applicable
since
article
i,
section
2
was
put
in
to
the
constitution
originally.
it
--
up-to-date,
we
have
had
no
enforcement.
congress
could've
enforced
it.
it
has
refused
to
do
so
despite
widespread
violation
by
the
states.
but
it's
clear
that
this
court's
decision
in
wood
v.
broom
only
holds
that
the
requirements
of
the
act
of
1911
would
no
longer
applicable
by
their
omission
from
the
act
of
1929.
this
court
did
not
purport
to
reach
the
constitutional
questions
which
do
not
seem
to
have
been
raised
in
that
case.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
justice
harlan,
we
have
to
read
article
i,
section
2
against
the
context
of
the
federal
convention
--
convention,
the
ratifying
convention
in
the
federalist.
we
see
in
the
language
a
clear
indication
and
implication
of
the
standard
that
representative
shall
be
apportioned
among
the
several
states
the
--
the
right
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
that
is
correct
but
it
is
the
people
who
are
to
be
represented.
the
constitution
establishes
that
standard.
and
we
see
no
basis
in
the
federal
convention
or
in
anything
else
that's
happened
to
justify
any
departure
from
a
standard
of
popular
representation.
it
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
yes,
sir,
we
do.
we
feel
very
definitely
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
restates
the
principle
of
--
of
equality
which
runs
from
the
declaration
of
independence
following
but
even
without
the
fourteenth
amendment,
either
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
or
the
equal
protection
clause,
we
would
have,
it
seems
to
me,
the
same
constitutional
case
under
article
i,
section
2
itself.
this,
i
think,
is
implicit
in
this
court's
decisions
in
saylor,
mosley
and
classic
in
which
this
court
held
that
the
right
to
vote
included
not
only
the
right
to
mark
a
ballot,
the
right
to
drop
it
in
a
box
but
have
that
ballot
counted
in
its
full
weight,
undiluted
by
fraudulent
ballots
which
was
the
case
in
saylor.
it
seems
to
us
very
clear
that
unless
the
right
to
full
representation
is
protected
constitutionally,
the
right
to
mark
a
ballot,
to
drop
it
in
a
ballot
box
or
had
it
--
have
it
counted
formally
is
a
really
little
moment
that
these
rights
are
complimentary.
one
supplements
the
other,
each
is
essential
to
the
fulfillment
of
the
other.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
frankly,
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
could
be
either,
i
think
without
being
in
conflict
with
the
constitution.
we
have
chosen
population
simply
because
the
population
statistics
are
readily
available
from
a
reliable
source.
our
--
unfortunately,
our
figures
on
registered
voters
in
georgia
include
many
people
who
had
long
since
deceased
although
they
sometimes
turn
up
voting
in
elections
and
they're
not
particularly
accurate.
i
think
it
would
not
be
inconsistent
with
this
basic
principle
to
have
either
standard
views
as
the
federal
standard
but
in
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
read
from
that
section
alone,
a
very
definite
conclusion
as
to
whether
or
not
it
should
be
population
vis-à-vis
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
--
registered
voters.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
i
think
it
very
definitely
has
relevance
because
it
again
reinforces
what
we
consider
to
be
the
principle
already
stated
in
article
i,
section
2
of
equal
popular
representation.
there,
of
course,
they
were
aiming
that
prohibition
at
the
racial
discrimination
which
was
existed
in
many
states
at
the
time
of
its
enactment
in
1868
and
it
was
the
purpose,
of
course,
to
deny
those
states
should
they
not
permit
colored
qualified
citizens
to
vote,
to
deny
them
representation.
so
i
don't
think
though
that
you
can
read
from
its
language
of
male
citizens
unnecessarily
be
federal
standard
which
are
applicable
on
article
i,
section
2.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
if
you
read
too
literally,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
of
course,
you
would
include
your
non-citizen
population
since
they
are
persons
res
--
resident
within
the
state.
i
think
i
would
be
hesitant
to
do
so
frankly.
i
think
there
is
a
basis
for
either
population
or
registered
voters.
in
georgia,
i
think
it
would
make
little
difference
for
working
with
the
statistical
figures
in
granting
their
unreliability
in
some
instances
as
close
correlation
seems
to
follow
between
population
and
registered
voters
so
that
the
distinctions
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
registered
voters.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
yes,
sir.
there's
--
there
seems
to
be
a
roughly
a
4-to-1
ratio,
fulton
county
556,000
people
has
in
1960,
roughly
145,000
people
registered
vote
and
this
follows
very
consistently
throughout
the
states,
smaller
counties
as
well
as
larger
counties,
there
are
rare
exceptions.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
well,
basically,
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
i
would
have
to
say
that
i
think
it
really
is
people
because
the
language
of
section
2
article
i
confers
the
right
to
representation
upon
the
people.
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
initial
policy
determination.
but
since
other
sections
of
the
constitution
limit
the
right
of
those
who
are
qualified,
i
think
there
is
a
basis
for
saying
that
it
--
it
is
those
qualified
who
really
exercise
the
right
to
really
participate
in
the
governmental
choice
of
electing
representatives
in
congress.
i
think
of
it
because
of
this,
there
is
the
basis
for
saying
that
also
could
be
the
foundation.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
that's
correct,
sir
but
article
i,
section
4
delegates
to
the
states
the
power
to
prescribe
qualifications
and
this,
necessarily,
must
limit
the
language
of
the
people
in
article
i,
section
2.
i
suppose
none
of
the
framers
would
really
suggest
that
a
9-year
old
citizen
could
elect
representatives.
we
would
suggest
that
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
sir,
surely,
that
is
correct.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
certainly.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
i
think
that
is
certainly
correct.
there
was
unfortunate
statement,
it
seems
to
me,
made
earlier
in
the
arguments
this
week
that
if
you
were
the
minority
party
in
election,
you
really
weren't
represented
by
the
man
but
you
are.
the
principle
of
democratic
government
does
not
entitle
you
to
prevail
but
only
to
have
an
equal
opportunity
to
elect
a
representative.
it's
the
equal
participation
which
it
secures
and
not
the
right
to
prevail.
we
would
suggest
very
strongly
and
submit
to
the
court
that
the
right
to
vote
for
representatives
in
congress
is
a
privilege
and
immunity
of
national
citizenship
guaranteed
against
the
invasion
by
the
states
for
it
is
derived
directly
from
the
constitution.
it
arises
out
of
the
essential
relationship
between
the
citizen
and
his
national
government.
it
--
more
than
almost
any
other
right
that
can
be
conceived
really
is
a
privilege
and
immunity
of
national
citizenship.
what
other
--
whatever
other
rights
may
not
be,
it
is
pretty
clear
that
the
right
to
vote
certainly
should
be
or
if
it
is
not,
then
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
will
remain
a
constitutional
dead
letter
because
it
cannot
have
a
clearer
case
for
constitutional
application
than
the
right
to
vote
for
representatives
in
our
national
congress.
it
would
also
seem
with
all
deference
that
in
a
decision
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
would
have
a
very
definite
advantage
from
the
point
of
view
of
judicial
administration
of
this
very
great
problem
raised
by
the
apportionment
cases,
state
and
federal.
for
by
placing
the
decision
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause,
this
court
can
require
a
higher
standard
substantial
equality
of
population
which
it
may
be
unwilling
to
require
of
one
or
both
houses
of
the
state
legislatures.
clearly,
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
has
not
been
held
to
apply
the
state
legislative
apportionment.
it
would
seem
very,
very
definite
advantage
to
putting
the
decision
on
that
ground
require
a
high
standard
of
equality
of
political
representation
in
the
house
of
representatives,
a
uniform
federal
standard
which
will
govern
all
states
equal,
texas
as
well
as
georgia,
washington
as
well
as
maine.
i
would
now
like
to
address
my
attention
to
what
has
been
in
the
past,
a
very
major
area
of
difficulty
for
those
urgent
judicial
intervention
in
this
area,
this
one
which
we
have
pitched
on
previously.
it
was
relied
upon
under
the
law
deemed
by
the
court
below
and
that
is
the
question
of
whether
the
power
of
congress
under
article
i,
section
4
is
exclusive
of
that
as
a
judiciary.
first,
i
think
we
can
accept
this
court's
analysis
in
coleman
and
miller
and
look
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
constitutionally
demonstrable
commitment
of
this
area
to
the
congress
and
i
think
the
answer
must
definitely
be
no.
nothing
in
the
power
itself,
suggest
that
congressional
power
should
be
exclusive
nor
was
there
anything
in
the
minutes
of
the
federal
convention
suggesting
that
the
power
of
congress
over
this
area
was
thought
by
the
framers
to
be
exclusive.
there
is
no
basis
for
the
historical
assertion
that
this
power
is
exclusive.
furthermore,
this
court
has
repeatedly
asserted
jurisdiction
in
areas
involving
federal
voting
rights
for
members
of
congress
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
states
under
article
i,
section
4
had
also
been
delegated
power
and
that
this
power
was
subject
to
the
revisory
power
of
congress
under
that
section.
the
typical
case
is
the
case
of
racial
discrimination
in
federal
elections.
clearly,
the
congress
could
have
stepped
in
and
prescribed
a
uniform
federal
standard
for
voting
qualifications.
it
could've
conducted
the
elections
itself
had
it
so
desired.
it
could've
completely
excluded
state
participation
in
establishing
this
qualification.
nevertheless,
this
court
on
repeated
instances
had
stepped
in
and
enforced
the
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
to
hold
that
you
could
not
exclude
qualified
persons
from
the
right
of
suffrage
in
federal
elections
and
what's
more,
in
state
elections
merely
because
of
race.
it
seems
that
that
is
really
the
perfect
analog
to
the
right
which
is
now
asserted
here.
we
are
asserting
a
different
area
of
the
constitution.
we're
asserting
a
right
derived
directly
from
article
i,
section
2
and
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
but
the
supervisory
po
--
power
of
congress
is
derived
from
article
i,
section
4.
the
power
of
the
states
is
delegated
by
article
i,
section
4.
it's
clear
that
unless
you're
prepared
to
retreat
to
the
proposition
that
this
court
could
not
have
enforced
the
constitutional
standards
in
the
race
cases,
it
could
not
hold
that
--
the
power
of
congress
under
article
i,
section
4
with
this
area
is
exclusive.
furthermore,
it's
pointed
out
by
judge
tuttle
in
the
district
court,
it
would
seem
that
in
allowing
the
states
to
exercise
the
power
to
the
district
and
to
prescribe
qualifications,
congress
does
so
on
the
assumption
that
the
states
will
comply
with
the
constitutional
standards
of
the
federal
constitution.
it
does
not
intend
that
the
state
can
depart
from
those
principles
nor
could
congress
intend
if
it
so
desired.
we
take
the
position
and
we
do
not
need
to
for
purposes
of
this
case
but
i
think
its
fair
to
do
so
to
apprise
the
court
fully
of
our
position
on
this
point
that
congress
could
not
if
it
so
desire
to
legislate
the
congressional
districts
which
now
exist
in
georgia
because
congress
as
well
as
the
state
governments
is
subject
to
the
fundamental
requirements
of
equal
popular
representation
under
article
i,
section
2.
furthermore,
this
court,
again
in
dealing
with
the
power
of
congress
under
article
i,
section
4
has
a
long
series
of
decisions,
repeatedly
rejected
the
claim
that
this
power
was
exclusive
of
that
of
the
federal
judiciary.
they
only
have
mentioned
a
few
cases,
smiley
and
holm,
wood
and
broom
and
colegrove
and
green.
in
each
of
these
cases,
the
assertion
was
made
that
the
power
was
exclusive.
it
would
in
broom,
the
district
judge
holmes,
dissenting
at
great
length,
emphasized
repeatedly
the
exclusivity
of
what
he
thought
to
be
the
power
of
congress
under
article
i,
section
4.
in
colegrove
and
green,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
devoted
many
eloquent
lines
of
his
opinion
to
this
proposition,
yet,
in
each
instance,
this
argument
was
rejected
by
a
majority
of
this
court.
in
wood
and
broom,
notwithstanding
the
assertion
by
judge
holmes
below,
not
a
single
member
of
this
court
accepted
that
argument.
the
majority
went
off
completely
on
the
statutory
construction
question.
the
concurring
justices
placed
their
decision
for
want
of
equity,
a
ground
plainly
unturnable
if
this
court
were
without
jurisdiction.
turning
to
the
question
of
remedy
briefly,
it
is
our
position
that
the
court
should
hold
the
georgia
apportionment
of
congressional
districts
unconstitutional
and
enjoin
its
enforcement,
enjoin
the
two
defendants
from
carrying
out
its
provisions.
this
relief
would
not
been
in
conflict
with
the
policy
of
congress
favoring,
in
some
instances,
the
election
of
congressmen
by
districts
for
congress
itself
in
other
instances
has
sanctioned
exceptions
to
this
principle.
for
instance,
in
this
last
congressional
election,
alabama
elected
all
eight
of
her
congressional
representatives
on
an
at
large
basis
because
of
the
failure
of
the
states
to
reapportion
her
congressional
districts
following
a
loss
of
representation
out
of
the
1960
census.
thus,
this
situation
is
not
materially
different
from
that
which
exist
in
that
situation
because
it
is
merely
a
situation,
both
are
situations
of
where
the
old
apportionment
act
has
become
invalid
and
inadequate
to
comply
with
the
applicable
standards
required
of
it.
further,
it
--
it
seems
to
me,
a
specious
argument
to
suggest
that
in
requiring
an
at
large
election
that
this
court
is
--
itself
moving
in
conflict
with
the
discretionary
power
of
congress
to
require
elections
by
a
district.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
this
court
need
not
to
do
so,
mr.
justice
brennan,
because
it
has
a
clear
precedent
in
its
own
opinions
for
an
at
large
election
in
a
congressional
case.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
certainly,
there
is
no
reason
that
we
should
not
leave
it
to
the
district
court.
we
would
not
--
we
are
unhappy
to
see
the
district
court
decide
which
remedy
should
be
appropriate.
however,
we
do
submit
that
really
the
only
clearly
appropriate
remedy
is
the
at
large
election.
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
smiley
v.
holm,
we
would
be
very
hesitant
to
ask
either
this
court
or
the
district
court
to
draw
congressional
districts
to
congressionally
remap
the
state
of
georgia.
the
at
large
election
giving
the
state
in
its
ordinary
session
of
a
joint
--
general
assembly
which
convenes
in
january
of
this
year,
an
opportunity
and
orderly
manner
to
enact
a
new
congressional
districting
act
which
complies
with
the
constitutional
standard
set
forth
by
this
court
would
to
us
be
an
eminently
desirable
way
to
solve
the
problem.
further,
it
would
seem
to
us
also
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
wood
v.
broom,
if
the
congressional
districting
apportionment
in
the
district
court
is
held
invalid,
that
it
necessarily
follows
from
article
i,
section
2
that
the
--
that
the
election
must
be
on
an
at
large
basis.
this
in
effect
is
what
the
--
this
court
said
in
smiley
v.
holm,
relying
upon
article
i,
section
2
as
the
basis
for
requiring
at
large
elections
in
that
and
although
a
different
situation
basically
involving
the
same
problem.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan,
very
definitely.
i
--
it
is
our
position
that
although
we
need
not
reach
it
in
this
case
that
congress
as
well
as
the
court
has
the
overwhelming
duty
to
follow
the
constitutional
standards
which
are
implicit
in
article
i,
section
2
to
apportion
representatives
in
accord
with
a
uniform
federal
standard
of
equality
and
representation
in
the
house
of
representatives.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
i
would
again
say
that
the
language
of
the
article
is
to
be
read
be
in
the
context
of
the
history
of
the
federal
convention,
the
declaration
of
independence
and
that
no
one
ever
supposed
that
congress
would
depart
from
this
basic
principle
of
representation
on
the
basis
of
the
people.
after
all,
the
constitution
says
it
isn't
the
people
who
are
represented
in
the
house
of
representatives,
not
political
districts,
not
political
subdivisions.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
i
would
not
concede
that
it's
the
same,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
read
in
the
context
again
of
the
federal
convention.
after
all,
they
weren't
talking
about
state
legislatures
in
the
federal
convention,
they
were
talking
about
the
house
of
representatives.
they
were
talking
about
the
principles
for
which
only
a
few
years
before
we
had
fought
a
revolution.
they
were
talking
about
the
principle
of
which
itself
resided
in
the
declaration
of
independence,
the
right
to
representation
in
the
legislature
that
it
is
a
much
stronger
and
much
clearer
standard
set
forth
in
article
i,
section
2
than
any
which
can
be
read
into
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
this
would
be
our
position.
there
is
no
permissible
deviation.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
--
it
would
be
our
position
that
matters
of
state
policy
are
paramount
in
the
state
legislative
apportionment
area
and
this
may
give
the
states
greater
latitude
to
depart
from
the
principle
of
the
equality
than
that
which
exist
in
the
national
legislature
because
it
is
the
constitution
which
--
which
dictates
the
standard.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
it
would
be
that
--
it
would
be
our
suggestion
and
i
completely
agree
with
mr.
justice
black
in
colegrove
that
--
that
which
it
leaves
to
the
states
is
not
the
power
to
make
policy
but
instead
the
power
to
follow
the
constitutional
standards
already
set
forth.
they
do
not
have
the
power
to
make
a
policy
determination
as
to
what
the
basis
for
representation
in
the
house
of
representatives
shall
be
from
their
state.
turning
again
to
one
other
difficult
area
or
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
yes,
sir.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
the
primaries
--
my
friends
from
the
state
can
really
set
straight
on
the
date.
i
don't
think
they're
really
established.
excuse
me,
i've
been
advised
they
have
a
second
wednesday
on
september.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
we
are
fortunate
to
have
a
regular
session
of
our
general
assembly
meeting
between
now
and
then
so
that
we
can
avoid
with
--
it
begins
the
3rd
of
january
--
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
its
40
days.
it's
a
40-day
session.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
no,
sir,
it
could
be
--
it
could
then
be
reconvened
into
an
extraordinary
session
by
the
governor
if
that
should
come
necessary.
mr.
emmet
j.
bondurant
ii
yes,
sir.
the
governor
can
call
an
extraordinary
session
at
anytime.
in
fact,
we
had
two
as
a
result
of
baker
v.
carr
and
then
our
own
state
legislative
apportionment
case.
turning
to
the
problem
with
equitable
discretion,
we
submit
that
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
this
doctrine
is
applicable.
unlike
colegrove
v.
green
and
wood
v.
broom,
this
court
has
ample
time
to
set
forth
a
standard
and
this
will
permit
the
state
plenty
of
time
to
set
forth
a
new
valid
apportionment
without
completely
upsetting
its
entire
electoral
system.
colegrove
was
not
decided
until
june.
wood
v.
broom
was
decided
october
18th
before
the
november
elections.
in
these
cases,
it
may
have
been
appropriate
to
invoke
equitable
discretion.
it
is
not
in
this
case.
we
have
plenty
of
time,
the
legislature,
if
it
desires
to
comply
with
constitutional
standards
has
an
opportunity
to
do
so.
i
would
like
also
to
dispose
of
as
briefly
as
possible
the
suggestion
by
the
lower
court
and
by
the
appellees
here
that
we
have
had
a
great
change
of
political
climate
in
georgia
which
makes
legislative
relief
likely,
this
is
highly
unlikely.
since
the
decision
of
the
lower
court,
we
have
had
one
session
with
the
general
assembly,
40
days
long.
the
appellant
here
introduced
a
bill
of
the
reapportionment,
the
house
of
representatives,
the
congressional
districts.
it
was
referred
to
our
rules
committee
which
is
not
unlike
the
rules
committee
next
door.
it
never
was
reported
entirely
in
that
session.
a
senate
resolution
was
introduced
--
passed
the
senate
which
is
popularly
based
and
was
voted
down
in
the
house.
this
was
merely
a
resolution
to
study
the
problem.
it
was
voted
down.
the
last
day
of
the
session,
they
--
under
the
general
powers
given
to
the
speaker
of
the
house
in
the
present
pro
tempore
of
the
senate,
they
authorized
a
commitment
or
creation
of
any
number
of
committees
without
definition
or
rhyme
or
reason
following
the
grant
of
the
appeal
in
this
case,
a
committee
from
the
senate
and
a
committee
of
the
house,
joint
committee,
10,
i
think
from
each
body
was
appointed
and
they
have
been
holding
hearings
in
the
congressional
districts
to
the
state.
but
all
of
this
ignores
the
fact
that
the
georgia
house
of
representatives
commented
on
this
court
in
sanders
v.
gray
which
follows
the
same
3-to-1
system
which
required
the
county
in
the
system
be
held
invalid
is
--
so
under
representative,
that
a
fair
apportionment
has
little
chance
of
passage.
fulton
county
toward
fourth
of
the
population
of
the
state
has
1.46%
of
the
representation
in
the
georgia
house
of
representatives.
3.34%
of
the
representation
in
the
house
of
representatives
is
possessed
by
the
fifth
congressional
district
which
is
really
the
only
one,
we
submit
is
really
grossly
overrepresented.
there
is
no
motive
in
these
other
areas
either
inside
of
our
house
to
do
anything
about
this
problem.
the
crying
need
is
not
there,
the
power
is
not
here.
we
have
no
initiative.
we
have
no
referendum.
thus,
it
is
clear
that
equitable
discretion
quite
the
contrary
of
requiring
this
court
to
abstain,
demands
that
this
court
grant
relief
in
order
that
we
may
have
again
our
full
right
to
representation
in
the
house
of
representatives.
after
all
in
--
i
think
harold
laski
was
probably
right
that
no
government
can
seriously
claim
to
satisfy
the
constitutional
standards
unless
it
is
required
by
constitutional
command
that
take
into
account
the
basic
principles,
the
right
of
the
people
to
representation
in
the
house
of
representatives
equally,
fully
and
without
discrimination
such
as
those
which
we
have
here.
with
leave
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
my
associate
in
the
bar.
