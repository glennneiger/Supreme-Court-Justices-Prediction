mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
government
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
supporting
the
appellants.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
believes
that
this
court
need
only
decide
two
issues
in
the
case
now
before
it,
whether
the
federal
courts
have
the
power
to
consider
issues
of
congressional
districting
and
whether
in
ordinary
circumstances,
the
federal
court
should
exercise
their
equitable
jurisdiction
rather
than
dismissing
for
want
of
equity.
we
believe
that
the
court
need
not
decide
whether
georgia's
congressional
districting
actually
violates
article
i,
section
2
or
any
of
the
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
the
district
court
said
that
georgia's
congressional
districting
was
grossly
out
of
balance
and
was
arbitrary
and
intermediate
that
it
might
possibly
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
do
not
believe
that
to
determine
this
issue
either
way
and
therefore,
we
think
that
the
court
may
properly
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
a
determination
of
the
merits.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there
were
no
factual
disputes
in
baker
and
carr
your
honor
and
essentially
the
same
situation
was
involved.
the
district
court
in
baker
and
carr
had
had
indicated
some
doubt
as
to
the
constitutionality
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
tennessee's
legislature
and
nonetheless,
this
court
confined
itself
to
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
--
your
honor,
i
don't
--
my
understanding
and
i
--
and
of
course
i
haven't
read
the
--
the
record
for
quite
a
while
when
baker
and
carr
but
my
understanding
was
that
--
that
all
the
essential
facts
were
before
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
indicated
very
strongly
that
the
tennessee
legislature
was
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but
in
--
in
any
event,
we
think
that
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression
in
this
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
--
that's
right.
it
would
your
honor
but
we
still
believe
that
even
--
that
even
if
there
is
this
distinction
that
this
--
that
this
is
a
situation
in
--
involving
difficult
issue
which
--
and
which
there
were
--
has
very
few
precedents
in
the
lower
courts
or
state
courts.
it
would
be
properly
decided
in
the
first
instance
by
the
district
court.
the
government
submits
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
baker
and
carr
in
all
respects.
we
believe
that
baker
and
carr
is
controlling
as
to
the
power
of
the
federal
courts
for
two
reasons.
first,
because
in
baker
and
carr,
this
court
explicitly
stated
that
this
court
does
have
power
to
adjudicate
the
constitutionality
of
congress
--
congressional
districting.
and
even
without
this
expressed
statement,
we
believe
that
it
logically
follows
that
if
the
federal
courts
can
adjudicate
the
constitutionality
of
state
legislative
apportionment,
they
can
likewise
adjudicate
the
constitutionality
of
congressional
districting.
and
finally,
we
believe
that
baker
and
carr
is
controlling
not
only
on
the
power
of
the
federal
courts
but
also
whether
the
federal
court
should
exercise
their
power
and
refuse
to
dismiss
for
want
of
equity
in
the
ordinary
circumstances
such
as
the
circumstances
which
are
now
before
this
court.
as
to
the
power
of
the
federal
courts,
to
hear
cases
involving
congressional
districting,
this
involves
three
separate
issues
as
this
court
recognized
to
baker
and
carr,
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts,
the
standing
of
the
plaintiffs
to
bring
the
action
and
whether
the
particular
question
is
justiciable.
i
will
pass
over
standing
and
subject
matter
jurisdiction
since
we
think
that
these
questions
are
clear
beyond
doubt
and
i
will
leave
our
discussion
to
our
brief.
we
likewise
believe
that
there
is
little
question
that
the
federal
courts
have
the
power
to
adjudicate
congressional
districting
in
the
sense
of
justiciability.
in
baker
and
carr,
this
court
citing
its
earlier
decisions
in
smiley
and
holm,
koenig
and
flynn
and
carroll
and
becker
stated
and
i'm
quoting,
"that
these
cases
settle
the
issue
in
favor
of
justiciability
of
questions
of
congressional
redistricting.
the
court
followed
these
precedents
in
colegrove."
end
of
quotation.
all
four
of
these
cases
which
the
court
cited
actually
involved
congressional
districting
within
particular
states.and
in
addition,
this
court
assumed
justiciability
in
wood
and
broom
by
going
on
to
decide
the
merits
of
the
case.
therefore,
there
are
six
cases
decided
by
this
court
culminating
in
baker
and
carr
in
which
this
court
has
held
or
assumed
that
the
questions
of
congressional
districting
may
be
decided
by
the
federal
courts.
quite
apart
from
the
explicit
statement
in
baker
and
carr
and
the
earlier
decisions
of
this
court
in
congressional
redistricting
cases
--
in
congressional
districting
cases,
we
believe
justiciability
of
congressional
districting
follows
from
the
holding
in
baker
and
carr
that
state
legislative
apportionment
is
justiciable.
these
two
problems
are
in
many
respects
the
same.
the
first
step
in
apportioning
a
state
legislature
is
to
decide
on
the
appropriate
districts
and
then
to
allocate
the
representatives
among
those
districts.
insofar
as
the
two
problems,
congressional
districting
and
state
legislative
apportionment
are
different
we
believe
that
the
justiciability
of
congressional
districting
is
more
clear
for
two
of
the
most
serious
problems
in
this
area
concerning
justiciability,
are
whether
appropriate
subsidy
of
criteria
can
be
ascertained
and
whether
proper
judicial
remedies
may
be
found.
and
we
believe
that
both
of
these
problems
are
easy
of
solution
as
to
congressional
districting
than
is
to
state
legislative
apportionment.
as
to
the
substance
of
criteria,
the
solicitor
general
in
the
state
apportionment
cases
in
arguing
last
week
and
today
advanced
various
criteria
to
be
applied
to
state
legislative
apportionment.
and
we
believe
that
all
these
criteria
would
be
equally
applicable
to
congressional
districting.
for
example,
if
the
state
districted
its
congressman
without
any
with
--
so
as
to
discriminate
against
some
people
and
in
favor
of
others
without
any
rhyme
or
reason
in
a
crazy
quilt
pattern,
we
think
that
this
would
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
it
would
appear
that
this
standard
would
invalidate
georgia's
congressional
districting.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
--
i
was
--
i
was
going
on
your
honor.
we
think
that
beyond
those
standards
that
there's
an
even
more
simple,
more
precise
standard
in
the
area
of
--
of
congressional
districting
and
that
is
population.
congressional
districting
based
directly
on
population
without
any
substantial
deviation.
all
i
was
trying
to
indicate,
your
honor,
is
that
even
if
that
were
rejected
that
at
least,
the
very
least,
all
the
standards
applying
the
state
legislative
apportionment
would
be
equally
applicable
but
we
believe
that
there
is
an
even
clearer
and
more
strict
standard.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
your
honor,
i
--
i
think
in
the
case
of
congressional
districting
thought
that
--
that
there
may
be
instances
in
which
that
would
result
still
in
very
significant
discrimination
but
in
general,
yes
sir
--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
very
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
that's
right.
nor
--
normally,
that
would
work
out
with
substantial
equality
and
we
would
have
no
objection
to
that
and
i
don't
think
the
appellants
would
either.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there
would
be
so
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
and
there
will
be
--
nobody
had
that
i
know
of
has
ever
argued
for
a
precise
equality
either
as
to
state
legislative
apportionment
or
as
to
congressional
districting
in
the
sense
that
each
district
had
to
be
exactly
the
same
as
another.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
we
would
--
your
honor,
we
would
argue
against
the
district
court
deviating
from
that
standard
if
the
case
then
came
again
to
this
court,
that's
right.
we
think
that
it's
a
traditional
and
excellent
principle
of
this
court
to
only
decide
the
constitutional
issues
which
must
be
decided
at
the
time.
we
do
not
think
this
is
about
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
pardon
me?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
your
honor,
i'd
--
well,
in
general
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
don't
know
what
--
what
exceptions
you're
--
you're
thinking
of
but
that
is
the
general
principle.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
and
we
would
think
that
that
would
be
well
applied
here.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
of
course
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there
--
there
--
there
is
a
difference,
your
honor.
and
i
--
i'm
not
sure
how
important
the
difference
is
because
the
trials
in
this
--
in
this
type
of
case
are
not
of
course
the
kind
of
--
when
the
disputed
facts
--
essentially
all
these
cases
revolve
around
statistics.
just
point
how
many
people
are
in
the
various
areas.
and
those,
of
course,
were
all
before
the
district
court
and
this
court
in
baker
and
carr
and,
of
course
are
here
before
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
the
standard
of
equality
is
implicit
in
article
i,
section
2
which,
of
course,
apportions
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
among
the
states
on
the
basis
of
population.
and
we
be
--
we
believe
that
the
history
of
the
constitution
and
its
ratification,
which
are
set
out
in
our
brief
in
this
case,
had
more
fully
explored
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief
in
the
maryland
apportionment
case.
that
these
materials
demonstrate
convincingly
that
in
contrast
to
the
senate,
the
house
of
representatives
was
designed
to
represent
people
and
that
therefore,
the
various
districts
were
to
be
substantially
equal
in
population.
madison,
randolph,
mason,
james
wilson
and
the
other
framers
of
the
constitution
whose
views
ultimately
resulted
in
the
creation
of
a
house
of
representatives
elected
directly
by
the
people
and
apportioned
among
the
states
in
the
basis
of
population
believed
in
the
population
principle
not
only
among
the
states
but
also
among
the
various
districts.
for
example,
edmund
randolph,
in
supporting
his
own
proposed
amendment,
to
base
apportionment
on
the
decennial
census,
a
proposal
which
was
adopted
and
is
--
and
is,
of
course,
included
in
the
present
constitution.
he
said
if
equality
between
great
and
small
states
be
inadmissible
because
in
that
case,
unequal
numbers
of
constituents
would
be
represented
by
equal
numbers
of
votes
was
it
not
equally
inadmissible
that
a
larger
and
more
populous
district
of
america
should
hereafter
have
less
representation
than
a
smaller
and
less
populous
district.
if
a
fair
representation
of
the
people
be
not
secured,
the
injustice
of
the
government
will
shake
it
to
its
foundations.
and
in
federalist
number
45,
madison
said
that
in
apportioning
members
of
the
house
of
representatives,
numbers
are
the
only
proper
scale
of
representation.
in
the
--
in
bush
and
martin
which
is
the
texas
--
the
texas
congressional
districting
case
which
was
decided
last
month,
we
believe
judge
ingraham,
in
concurring
in
that
case,
properly
stated
the
principle.
the
congressional
dis
--
that
unequal
congressional
districting
is
a
breach
of
the
great
compromise
that
is
at
the
constitutional
convention
which
has
served
us
so
long
and
so
well
by
which
representation
in
the
house
of
representatives
was
to
be
based
on
population
and
representation
in
the
senate
to
be
divided
equally
among
the
states.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
your
honor.
with
--
it's
--
it
is
only
implicit
in
the
original
constitution
in
article
i,
section
2.
however,
i
--
it
is
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
thought
of
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
that's
--
that's
fair
to
say
but
i
don't
think
that
--
on
the
hand
that
you
--
that
you
can
draw
form
the
materials
of
the
constitutional
convention
a
decision
to
not
put
it
in
so
as
to
allow
an
equal
districting.
i
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
in
many
states,
if
--
there
was
the
choice.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
that
might
be
partial
reason.
however,
the
--
at
the
constitutional
convention,
it
seemed
to
be
assumed
that
they
would
be
elected
on
the
basis
of
districts.
madison
in
the
--
in
the
federalist
papers
talks
about
districts
and
i
--
i
think
it's
fairly
clear
that
they
assumed
that
the
election
would
be
on
the
bases
of
districts.
we
believe
that
the
problem
of
judicial
remedy
is
also
easier
if
anything
as
to
congressional
districting
than
as
to
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
--
i
should've
gone
on
your
honor.
i
--
i
had
swallowed
that
up
in
my
original
statements
that
it
was
made
clear
at
the
convention
as
randolph's
statement
which
i
quoted
to
the
court,
makes
clear
that
they
was
expected
that
the
districts
would
be
equal
in
population,
substantially
equal
in
population.
there
are
many
such
statements
in
the
--
at
the
convention
and
in
the
ratifying
conventions
in
the
states
and
they're
set
forth,
summarized
in
our
--
in
our
brief
and
set
out
in
greater
detail
in
our
maryland
--
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief
in
the
maryland
case.
as
to
the
judicial
remedy,
both
in
state
apportionment
cases
and
the
congressional
districting
cases,
there,
it
is
equally
practicable
for
the
district
court
--
for
federal
district
court
to
require
a
judicial
reapportionment.
in
both
instances,
the
court
could
follow
local
political
subdivisions,
the
boundary
lines
of
local
political
subdivisions.
however,
there
is
an
additional
remedy
in
the
case
of
congressional
districting
which
is
far
more
practicable
as
to
congress
than
it
is
as
to
the
state
legislatures
and
this
is
an
election
at
large.
congress
itself
has
suggested
that
this
may
be
an
appropriate
remedy
by
providing
in
2
u.s.c.
section
2
(a)
that
if
a
state
fails
to
redistrict
after
losing
representation
in
--
after
a
decennial
census
that
the
state's
representation
shall
be
elected
at
large.
and
this
court
has
itself
ordered
elections
at
large
in
two
cases
in
which
it
has
invalidated
congressional
districting,
the
smiley
and
holm
which
involved
nine
representatives
and
carroll
and
becker
which
involved
13.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i'm
only
suggesting
that
--
that
if
the
remedies
are
--
would
be
the
same
in
both
situations
and
--
and
the
remedy
would
be
just
as
practical
here,
we
do
not
rely
on
those
cases
obviously
for
our
--
for
the
subsidy
of
criteria
and
that
should
be
applied.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
your
honor.
we
think
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
for
three
members
of
the
court
in
colegrove
is
inconsistent
with
smile
and
holm
and
the
other
earlier
cases
and
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
right
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
--
i
--
i
agree,
your
honor.
but
there
was
a
holding
in
colegrove
and
green
on
this
issue.
four
out
of
the
seven
members
of
the
court
held
that
congressional
apportionment
was
justiciable.
there
was
power
in
the
federal
courts.
and
so
we
think
that
colegrove
and
green
is
squarely
in
support
of
the
proposition
we
are
arguing.
we
submit
that
the
only
possible
basis
for
holding
the
congressional
districting
is
not
justiciable
whereas
state
legislative
apportionment
is
--
is
that
congress
is
a
coequal
branch
of
the
federal
government
and
that
congress
has
the
power
under
sections
4
and
5
of
article
1
to
regulate
congressional
elections.
however,
we
emphasize
that
while
congress
is
involved
in
the
sense
that
it
can
remedy
the
evil,
the
actual
districting
which
is
before
the
court
is
pursuant
to
a
state
statute
and
it
is
only
a
state
statute
which
is
under
attack.
congress
is
not
acting
and
no
possible
decision
of
the
federal
courts
in
this
case
could
interfere
with
congress.
in
addition,
neither
the
constitution
nor
its
history
support
the
proposition
that
congress'
power
over
congressional
elections
was
to
be
intended
to
be
exclusive.
now,
examination
of
the
history
of
the
original
constitution,
we
have
found
only
one
statement
bearing
on
this
point
and
it's
by
john
steele,
a
delegate
to
the
north
carolina
ratifying
convention.
he
argued
that
congress
under
article
1,
section
4
could
not
provide
for
unequal
districts.and
the
reason
--
and
he
--
and
the
justification
he
gave
was
that
if
congress
makes
laws
inconsistent
with
the
constitution,
independent
judges
will
not
uphold
them.
we
submit
that
at
least
it
was
mr.
steele's
view
that
if
congress
itself
provided
for
unequal
districting,
that
the
federal
courts
would
have
the
power
to
invalidate
such
a
statute.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
--
i'm
not
sure
one
can
fairly
ascribe
by
the
failure
to
do
anything
in
--
in
the
field
over
since
1929
that
it
is
provided
for
it.
i
don't
think
this
court
--
put
it
this
way,
this
court
would
not
have
to
invalidate
any
--
any
action
by
congress.
and
we
don't
think
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
your
honor,
from
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
it
is
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
1872
to
1929.
it
was
that
the
requirement
of
equality
was
in
--
was
in
the
various
statutes.
it's
now
no
longer
in
the
statute
and
was
not
there
before.
i
think
it
might
be
interesting
to
note
that
the
1929
legislation
came
following
a
period
when
congress
had
failed
to
follow
the
mandate
of
the
federal
constitution
to
reapportion
every
10
years.
and
almost
20
years
had
gone
by,
19
years
to
be
exact
and
it
may
well
be
that
at
that
time
there
were
considerable
numbers
of
seats
held
by
incumbent
congressmen
at
which
they
were
--
which
the
districts
were
overrepresented
and
there
was
no
--
and
they
admittedly
no
longer
provided
for
equality.
but
this
court
need
not
decide
in
this
case
whether
if
a
statute
were
passed
allowing
unequal
districts.
this
court
or
the
federal
courts,
generally,
would
have
the
power
to
invalidate
it.
mr.
steele's
statement
went
in
--
would
seem
to
indicate
they
--
that
this
court
would
have
the
power
but
here
we
have
a
situation
where
congress
has
taken
no
action.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
don't
think
that
that
necessarily
follows,
your
honor.
our
--
our
view
is
there
where
congress
has
not
acted
at
all
such
as
in
the
field
of
interstate
commerce.
what
congress
does
not
act,
this
court
will
invalidate
state
action
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
constitution.
there
maybe
more
room
for
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
by
not
doing
anything?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
--
your
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
--
i
don't
think
--
respectfully,
i
do
not
think
that
you
can
judge
from
what
happened
in
1929.
the
congress
decided
the
districts
would
be
unequal.
there
may
--
there
--
they
may
have
been
unable
to
form
a
majority
to
say
that
districts
must
be
equal
but
it
may
also
be
so
that
there
is
no
majority
for
saying
--
permitting
them
to
be
unequal.
all
that
happened
in
1929
and
all
we
know
is
that
the
old
provision
was
not
continued.
there
were
other
changes
in
the
statute
at
the
same
time
and
why
the
--
the
omission
occurred,
it
may
--
may
be
a
very
complicated
thing.
i'd
--
i
--
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
we've
--
we
have
not
addressed
ourselves
to
that.
i
think
--
i
think
the
government's
view
would
that
it
--
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
but
i
--
but
i
don't
think
that
--
that
my
disagreement
with
your
honor
is
that
i
don't
think
we
have
to
say
that.
i
think
we
could
say
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
i
think
that
we
--
that
it
could
be.
it
would
not
be
illogical
for
this
court
to
say
that
where
congress
has
acted,
the
congress
has
this
--
has
this
discretion.
but
in
the
absence
of
action,
that
--
that
districts
have
to
be
substantially
equal
in
population.
i
do
not
think
there
would
be
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we've
--
i
--
let
me
see
if
i
can
restate
it.
i
think
that
congress
has
some
--
may
have
discretion
here,
conferred
by
the
constitution
to
decide
under
article
i,
section
4
as
to
congressional
election.
now,
this
is
arguendo.
i
--
i've
indicated
before
that
the
government,
i'm
quite
sure,
would
be
here
again
saying
--
well,
i
suppose
we'll
be
forced
to
--
to
defend
our
statute
but
it
would
--
so
i'm
--
i'm
--
perhaps,
i
would
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
would
--
i
should
hesitate
to
say
them
--
exactly
what
we
would
do
but
i
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
the
--
it
has
just
occurred
to
me
that
we
might
be
in
somewhat
a
difficult
position
because
normally,
we
--
the
--
those
are
the
general's
offices
in
the
position
defending
the
constitutionality
of
--
of
congressional
legislation.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
you
honor
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
i
think
you
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
not
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
i
agree
with
you.
i
--
i'm
only
trying
to
--
to
limit
the
--
the
extent
to
which
this
court
must
go
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
i
didn't
want
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
back
on
that.
i
--
the
--
the
fact
--
the
fact
is
that
i
don't
think
that
that
is
--
that
that
must
be
logically
decided
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
agree
with
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
that's
my
reading
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
the
historical
materials
too,
right?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
agree
with
your
reading
of
the
--
of
the
constitutional
materials.
i
--
i
hate
to
make
this
a
major
point
of
--
of
disagreement
because
i
don't
think
that
this
is
a
major
issue
in
this
case.
other
than,
i
--
i
don't
think
it
need
be
decided
here.
that's
all
that
i've
intended
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
to
have
indicated.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
i
think
there's
very
little
likelihood
the
congress
would
ever
pass
such
a
statute.
i
--
i
don't
see
why
it
has
to
be
adjudicated
here.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
agree.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
agree
your
honor.
i
only
see
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
agree,
your
honor.
i
only
say
that
the
logic
of
our
argument
does
not
compel
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
one
conclusion
or
another.
although
it
tends
to
--
it
tends
to
--
i
--
i
would
think
that
it's
--
it
suggest
a
conclusion
in
--
in
such
a
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
what
i
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
i
think
there
are
some
areas
where
congress
does
have
discretion
when
it
ex
--
when
it
does
exercise
that
discretion.
it's
conceivable.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
of
course,
the
constitution
isn't
explicit
on
this
point
either
way.
either
this
--
it
does
give
congress
considerable
discretion
apparently
over
congressional
elections
in
article
i,
section
4.
whether
it
has
this
discretion,
i
think
would
be
in
my
view,
inconsistent
with
the
--
the
historical
materials
underlying
the
constitution
--
the
constitution
itself.
i
do
--
i
don't
think,
however,
that
it's
a
--
it's
a
clear
case,
not
merely
so
clear
a
case,
is
where
congress
has
not
acted.
that's
all
that
i've
intended
to
imply.
i
think
where
congress
has
not
acted
the
situation
is
plain
where
it
has
acted,
it
may
be
more
difficult.
as
to
the
question
of
want
of
equity
which
is
the
actual
decision
of
the
district
court,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
district
court's
decision
is
plainly
inconsistent
with
baker
and
carr.
this
court
stated
in
baker
and
carr,
the
complainants'
allegations
of
a
denial
of
equal
protection
present
to
justiciable
constitutional
course
of
action
from
which
appellants
are
entitled
to
a
trial
and
decision.
we
think
that
in
the
ordinary
case,
it
is
equally
so
that
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
a
trial
and
decision
in
a
congressional
districting
case.
there
are
no
unusual
circumstances
here
and
therefore
we
think
that
it
was
inappropriate
and
inconsistent
with
baker
and
carr
to
dismiss
for
want
of
equity.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
if
our
view
prevails
as
to
the
merits,
the
substantive
criteria?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
have
argued
this
--
the
question
of
substantive
criteria
in
the
same
way
we
argued
substantive
criteria
in
baker
and
carr
only
that
there
were
ascertainable
standards.
we
have
not
asked
this
court
and
i
have
not
--
i
may
have
given
the
--
contrary
indication
but
we
did
not
intend
to
ask
this
court
to
decide
what
were
the
substantive
criteria
in
this
case
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
what
i'd
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
would
be
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
we
were
--
we
were
suggesting
a
decision
in
the
congressional
districting
field
which
would
be
parallel
to
baker
and
carr.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
deciding
the
three
issues
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
was
our
position.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
i
respectfully
say,
i
don't
believe
that
was
the
government's
position
in
baker
and
carr.
what
we
suggested
as
many
cases,
it
would
not
be
necessary
for
the
federal
courts
to
adjudicate
the
constitutionality
of
the
apportionments
and
that
has
turned
out
to
be
so.
now,
also,
i've
--
i
respectfully
disagree
that
we
believe
the
federal
courts
have
no
business
on
this
field
or
--
or
should
be
out
of
this
field
as
much
as
possible.
of
course,
we
would
be
--
the
happiest
solution
is
for
the
state
legislatures
to
themselves
act
and
provide
for
fair
congressional
districting
as
fair
legislative
apportionment.
however,
we
believe
that
in
this
case,
the
federal
courts,
ultimately,
georgia's
legislature
does
not
act,
should
adjudicate
this
question
and
should
provide
a
suitable
remedy.
we
think
only
that
--
that
the
substantive
standards
need
not
be
decided
here
for
the
--
essentially
the
same
reasons
stated.
we're
not
required
to
be
decided
in
baker
and
carr
and
that
this
court
should
not
reach
out
and
decide
an
issue
which
has
not
yet
been
adjudicated
by
the
lower
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we'd
be
here
supporting
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
supporting
the
determination
of
the
district
court
to
hold
the
case.
we
would
not
--
we
--
we
believe
that
it's
an
appropriate
(inaudible)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
--
your
honor,
there
are
two
courses
that
are
quite
similar
to
what
you
said.
one
is
to
just
hold
the
case
for
the
legislature.
the
other
is
to
adjudicate
the
constitutionality
of
the
section
then
holding.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
for
--
well,
for
a
reasonable
time
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
not
--
not
for
a
--
not
for
an
indefinite
period,
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
for
one
session
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
of
the
legislature
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
they'll
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
--
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
there
has
been
a
session
of
the
legislature
since
that
time
it
did
not
act.
now,
there
may
be
a
justification.
the
case
after
all
was
on
appeal
and
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
it
said
it
was
arbitrary
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
didn't
do
--
its
right,
it
didn't
do
--
it
did
make
the
statements
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
that
the
georgia
statute
as
now
applied
was
arbitrary.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but
it
did
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
just
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
dismissed
and
i
may
say,
unlike
the
appellants,
it
clearly
dismissed
for
want
of
equity.
it's
the
last
sentence
which
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
immediately,
no.
ultimately
--
ultimately
--
well,
we
would
think
that
the
georgia
legislature
should
have
the
opportunity
in
its
next
session
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
to
redistrict
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
but
if
--
if
it
does
not
act
then
i
would
not
think
that
an
adjudication
of
the
merits
should
be
followed
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
by
a
decree
then
not
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
not
--
not
--
not
another
delay
for
new
action
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
by
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
words
are
the
same.
i
don't
really
think
that
the
reason
is
the
same.
mr.
justice
rutledge
relied
on
the
imminence
of
an
election.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
wasn't
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
that's
--
yes,
yes,
there
were
some
other
things
too.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there's
certainly
no
problem
of
the
imminence
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
in
election,
that's
right.
we
think
that
there
are
no
--
there
are
no
circumstances
in
this
case.
they
are
really
different
than
any
other
congressional
districting
case.
to
call
it
want
of
equity
rather
than
lack
of
justiciability
it
seems
to
me
is
really
a
play
on
words.
if
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
in
this
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
in
--
in
--
to
be
applied
in
this
case,
it
really
means
that
the
federal
courts
will
not
hear
cases
of
congressional
districting.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
they
--
they're
already
here
on
their
way,
they'll
have
to
hear
it
--
this
case,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
