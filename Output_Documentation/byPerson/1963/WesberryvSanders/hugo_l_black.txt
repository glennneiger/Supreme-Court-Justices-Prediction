but
what
room
is
there
left
in
this
kind
of
case
to
apply
the
so-called
"crazy
quilt
doctrine"?
justice

l.

(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.

do
you
say
that
that
should
be
applied
like
an
iron
rule?

am
i
wrong
to
assume
--
am
i
wrong
to
assume
they
elected
by
districts
but
that
it
assumed
it
was
a
very
strong
desire
to
get
away
from
the
so-called
"rottenberg"
--
justice
hugo
l.
black

from
--
in
england.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
may
i
say
i
have
difficulty
in
this
being
with
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
escape
the
very
question
that
we're
raising.
if
congress
could
by
itself
divide
some
of
the
voters
of
right
so
that
by
creating
districts,
10,000
for
one,
100,000
for
another,
i
do
not
see
why
congress
hasn't
permitted
the
state
to
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
no
difficulty
with
the
question
when
i
read
the
history
of
the
debates
and
the
convention
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
where
this
was
expressly
referred
to
that
the
regulators,
the
congress
should
not
have
the
power
to
decrease
the
right
of
the
voters
which
is
given
by
the
constitution
each
one
of
them
a
vote.
they
didn't
use
the
word
each
one
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
a
vote
but
they
said
"the
people".
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
would
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
trying
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
agree
with
you
that
that
does
not
have
to
be
decided
though
as
if
the
congress
can
do
it.i
think
it
can
do
it
by
leaving
it
up
to
the
states
and
letting
those
stand.
i
do
not
think
that
we
could
construe
the
constitution
as
giving
the
congress
the
right
to
take
away
from
the
people
their
right
to
a
regular
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
believing
that
the
state
could
do
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
couldn't
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
of
course
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
there
are
some
times
in
the
history
of
constitutional
development
when
the
general
observation,
we
do
not
pass
on
questions
because
we
don't
have
to
read.
it
should
not
be
as
binding,
so
binding
if
we
can't
act.
why
shouldn't
we
when
we
reach
this
question
of
this
--
this
matter?
where
if
the
congress
--
would
--
should
we
leave
it
hanging
and
saying
that
the
states
can't
do
it
but
we
are
non-willing
to
say
the
congress
couldn't?
