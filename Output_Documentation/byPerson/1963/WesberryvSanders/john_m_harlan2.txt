justice
john
m.
harlan
but
where
do
you
find
in
article
i,
section
2
under
the
relation
with
standards
as
to
how
the
states
emphasized
the
manner
on
which
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
implied
standard
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
think
if
they
didn't
have
the
fourteenth
amendment
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
you
would
say
that
the
congress
exercised
its
federal
power
expressly
provided
that
the
district
or
the
states
are
not
based
on
population,
is
that
on
the
constitution?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
know
there's
no
specific
provisions
and
article
to
that
effect
that
although
the
article
does
(inaudible)
the
congress
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.
harlan
basically,
your
argument
as
to
the
standing
population
under
article
i
basically
the
same
with
the
argument
would
--
its
implicit
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
say
that
under
article
i
there
is
no
permissible
deviation
on
population
basis
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
the
constitution
leaves
to
the
states
in
a
manner
which
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
don't
you
have
to
recognize
that
they
stop
short
of
the
--
including
that
specific
provision
in
the
constitution
itself?
justice
john
m.
harlan
one
could
hardly
say
this
was
a
--
an
inadvertent
omission.
you
can't
account
for
its
submission
in
terms
of
congress
not
other
than
the
year
of
the
convention
not
having
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
address
itself
to
this
problem.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
districts,
in
my
representation,
are
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
in
those
cases
is
not
because
of
any
inequality
of
the
apportionment
because
the
districting
(inaudible)
by
the
states
do
not
comply
with
the
congressional
statute
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
which
is
a
little
different.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
do
rely
on
those
cases
between
the
cases
of
colegrove
and
green
in
this
court
then
there
should
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
not
apportioned
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it
is
true
that
(inaudible)
congressional
election
is
something
that
the
statute
has
provided
(inaudible)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
congress
intended
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
by
not
doing
--
by
enacting
a
statute
to
(inaudible).
would
you
say
that
constitutional
standard
provide,
of
course,
in
conduct,
in
which
of
the
previous
years,
because
at
the
time
it
was
(inaudible)?
you
don't
think
that
anything
would
be
clearer
than
the
fact
that
congress
rightly
or
wrongly
does
not
provide
anything
of
the
apportionment
statute?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
concerned
with
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
what
i'd
like
to
put
you
is
that
of
the
--
suppose
the
(inaudible)
if
congress
could
exercise
(inaudible)
and
did
provide
for
an
--
on
equal
population
districting
(inaudible)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
very
hard
to
see
that
the
constitutional
norms
would
barely
depending
upon
whether
the
(inaudible)
of
the
constitution
that
it
turns
on
whether
if
congress
have
chose
to
follow
or
not
follow.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
have
to
look,
mr.
terris,
where
you'd
find

john
m.
harlan
--
the

justice
john
m.
harlan

if
we
follow
that
in
this
case
the
