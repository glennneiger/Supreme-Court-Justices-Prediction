justice
potter
stewart
am
i
right
in
remembering
that
the
--
a
1911
federal
statute
required
the
congressional
districts
be
contiguous,
compact
and
as
nearly
equal
in
size
as
they
might
be
worse
to
that
effect?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
--
that
was
repealed
in
when?
1921?
justice
potter
stewart
1929.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
was
the
1911
legislation
that
it
--
it
have
any
predecessors
in
--
including
that
or
similar
languages
--
language?
justice
potter
stewart
was
i
to
understand
that
your
position
is,
you
tell
if
i'm
wrong,
is
it
any
such
statute
is
surplusage
basically?
justice
potter
stewart
to
be
an
act,
i
mean
just
a
needless
act.
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
you
would
permit
a
state
to
use
existing
political
boundary
line
as
i
--
as
i
am
sure
a
great
many
states
do,
that
is
to
say
that
the
third
congressional
district
shall
be
a,
b,
c,
d
and
e
county.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
--
i
think
i'm
right
in
the
--
in
my
understanding
that
it's
a
quite
usual
way
to
do
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
cases
which
are
very
fairly
apportioned
by
your
standing.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
extends
you
with
--
concede
that
there
might
be
some
validity
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
territorial
boundary
lines
existing
in
a
state.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
court
didn't
do
what
mr.
justice
white
suggested
it
might
have
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
--
that
was
judge
tuttle's
idea
was
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it's
very
similar
to
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
quite
not.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
didn't
retain
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
just
one
more
thing,
you
just
said,
mr.
terris
that
that
as
you
read
the
court's
opinion,
they
--
it
was
dismissed
for
want
of
equity.
now,
that
would
be
basically
the
same
reason
that
impelled
mr.
justice
rutledge
to
his
conclusion
of
colgrove
versus
green,
do
you
think?
justice
potter
stewart
among
other
things
--
justice
potter
stewart
among
other
things.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
that
factor
is
missing
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
do
you
think
it's
an
inaccurate
use
of
--
of
--
of
--
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
meaning
of
those
phrases?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
expressly
held
that
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
cash,
under
that
reapportioned
senate
that
was
done
in
january
this
year,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
state
senate.
does
--
does
the
county
in
which
atlanta
is
located,
that's
fulton
county
have
representation
in
the
state
senate
proportionate
to
the
population
of
the
county?
justice
potter
stewart
i
wonder
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
to
that
extent,
paragraph
14
of
your
complaint
in
this
case
is
that
it
should
--
should
be
--
should
be
modified
--
should
and
i
don't
mean
that
there
wasn't?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
one
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
was
quoted
by
mr.
rodgers.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
contributing
if
not
just
the
cause
of
this
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
as
--
as
of
the
existing
reapportioned
state
legislature
that's
been
attacked
in
the
lawsuit
or
the
--
or
the
old
one
--
or
the
old
one
before
the
action
of
--
of
this
january
that's
been
attacked
in
the
other
lawsuit?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
talking
now
about
the
other
lawsuit
in
georgia.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
that
was
done
by
the
georgia
general
assembly.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
was
