your

is
granted.
chief

on
what
do
you
base
your
conclusion
that
it
might
be
either
voters
or
persons
from
the
language
of
section
2
of

i?

oh,
you,
mr.
terris,
you're
going
to
argue
now,
are
you?

very
well.
chief
justice

yes.
chief
justice

warren
the
question
is,
do
you
have
any
logic
if
you
--
if
it
doesn't
reach
that
far?
chief

well,
does
this
say

--
does
the

say
it
shall

discretion?

chief

mr.
rodgers,
one
thing
about
me
is
your
--
you
don't
help
us
very
much
in
indicating
how
long
that
abstention
should
be,
whether
it
should
be
for
one
session
of
the
legislature
after
they've
already
had
one
session
in
which
they
could
do
it
or
whether
we
ought
to
go
farther
or
whether
we
ought
to
leave
those
loose
ends.
can
you
help
us
on
that?

mr.
cash.
