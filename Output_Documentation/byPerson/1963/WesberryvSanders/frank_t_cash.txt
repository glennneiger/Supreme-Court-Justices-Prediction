mr.
frank
t.
cash
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
associate
justices,
may
i
please
the
court.
even
though
we
alleged
in
--
in
our
notice
for
appeal,
we
set
forth
in
our
briefs
jurisdictional
statement
and
we've
argued
before
this
court
that
the
appellants
have
been
denied
their
constitutional
rights,
the
state
is
yet
to
offer
any
argument
to
support
the
finding
of
the
district
court
that
the
appellants
have
not
been
denied
their
constitutional
rights.
we
would
like
to
assume
that
we
have
set
forth
our
case
that
the
appellants
have
been
denied
the
constitutional
rights
and
will
proceed
to
counter
some
of
the
defenses
raised
by
the
state
in
this
matter.
in
the
area
of
the
abstention
doctrine,
certainly
it
has
never
been
held
by
this
court
that
the
powers
of
this
court
will
be
restrained
or
abstained
until
such
time
a
law
has
been
enacted.
if
a
person's
constitutional
rights
have
been
denied,
they're
entitled
to
relief
here
and
now.
in
the
case
that
was
before
this
court
and
decision
was
passed
down
from
this
court
in
the
case
of
mcneese
where
justice
douglas
says
that
the
application
of
the
abstention
to
this
suit
under
the
civil
rights
act
would
deplete
the
purpose
of
congress
to
make
the
federal
courts
that
primary
tribunal
to
grant
the
relief
set
forth
under
that
particular
case.
and
we
contend
that
our
case
is
also
brought
to
this
court
under
the
civil
rights
act,
we
have
been
denied
civil
rights
as
set
forth
under
that
act.
i
believe
counsel
for
the
state
was
being
less
than
frank
to
this
court
in
making
statements
that
the
appellants
of
our
suits
are
the
--
the
residents
of
the
fifth
congressional
district
of
georgia
have
a
powerful
voice
in
their
general
assembly.
the
facts
dispute
their
statement.
the
people
of
the
fifth
district
have
3.4%
influence
or
the
vote
in
the
state
house,
and
have
approximately
14%
in
the
state
senate.
gentlemen
of
the
court,
this
question
differs
from
the
cases
you've
been
hearing
for
the
past
week.
in
most
of
those
cases,
the
question
was,
“could
a
minority
control
a
majority
by
failing
to
apportion
on
an
equal
population
basis?”
this
case
presents
somewhat
different
facts.
here
is
the
case
where
a
--
there's
a
presumption
of
course
that
the
minority
controls
this
general
assembly
of
georgia.
but
even
if
majority
controlled
it,
the
people
of
the
fifth
district
are
a
disadvantaged
minority.
the
appellants
want
relief
so
that
the
majority
may
be
represented
in
the
house
of
representatives
of
congress,
but
the
majority
of
the
state
houses
could,
in
fact
the
--
but
i
think
the
facts
show
--
present
themselves
in
our
brief
that
the
only
district
in
georgia
that
is
grossly
disproportioned
to
the
other
districts
is
the
fifth
district.
the
other
nine
districts,
the
other
representatives
in
the
state
houses
of
the
other
districts
have
no
reason
to
change
this
present
system.
only
the
fifth
district
has
a
crying
need
for
relief.
so
we
would
suggest
that
the
relief
is
not
available
to
us
in
the
general
assembly.
certainly,
and
i
--
disadvantaged
minority
and
the
voting
case
has
no
difference
than
a
disadvantaged
minority
in
a
racial
or
segregation
case.
and
the
question
of
whether
they
have
adequate
opportunity
to
act,
in
our
record,
we
have
shown
that
the
--
a
bill
was
presented
in
the
state
legislature
in
1952.
it
was
introduced
by
representative
albertson
from
the
fulton
county,
delegation
in
that
bill
of
course
was
defeated
without
any
committee
being
appointed
to
study
the
matter
of
congressional
districting.
the
baker
versus
carr
was
decided
in
may
--
excuse
me
--
in
march
of
1962.
the
suit
was
filed
and
this
case
in
april
1962.
there
was
no
effort
by
the
state
legislative
body
to
take
any
action
in
the
matter
at
that
time,
nor
did
take
any
action
when
the
decision
was
handed
down.
there
was
a
special
session
of
the
state
legislature
to
consider
the
question
of
state
reapportionment.
and
gentlemen
of
court,
again,
let
me
emphasize
to
you
that
the
question
of
state
reapportionment
is
a
much
more
difficult
problem,
yet
the
state
body
reapportioned
the
state
senate.
54
senatorial
districts,
much
more
difficult
problem
than
the
question
here
of
having
10
congressional
districts
and
yet
they
did
it
in
--
within
a
--
a
month's
time.
they
met
--
enacted
the
law
within
--
actually
within
a
week,
and
they
had
election
other
that
law
within
a
month.
there
was
a,
i
quote,
reapportioned
general
assembly
in
january
of
this
year.
it
was
a
40-day
session,
split
by
15
days
interim
between
the
two
sessions,
given
sufficient
opportunity
again
for
the
general
assembly
to
act
in
this
matter.
mr.
frank
t.
cash
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
t.
cash
yes
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
frank
t.
cash
it
has
seven
senators
based
on
population
in
the
senate.
mr.
frank
t.
cash
was
that
the
paragraph
--
mr.
frank
t.
cash
--
of
our
brief
body.
mr.
frank
t.
cash
if
that
--
you
recall
in
that
we
said
that
a
controlling
reason,
if
not,
we
did
not
allege
--
absolutely,
that
was
the
only
reason.
mr.
frank
t.
cash
so
it's
certainly
a
contributing
cause
but
it's
not
the
only
cause.
mr.
frank
t.
cash
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
did
not
attack
the
legislature.
we
attacked
a
law
that's
still
in
effect.
we're
asking
that
it
would
be
declared
unconstitutional
and
asking
for
equitable
relief
to
retrain
the
enforcement
of
that
law.
we're
not
attacking
a
--
a
--
either
the
old
legislature
or
the
reapportioned,
which
is
alleged
and
it's
in
our
petition
to
indicate
that
as
i
have
said
today
that
the
reasons
why
we
couldn't
expect
relief
from
“political
remedy”
that's
been
suggested.
mr.
frank
t.
cash
oh,
the
toombs
case?
mr.
frank
t.
cash
yes,
that's
the
same
case
and
in
fact,
it
was
filed
prior
to
the
reapportion
just
the
judges
in
the
three-judge
court
in
the
toombs
cases
have
been
holding
pending
and
i
think
the
final
decision
of
this
court,
whether
the
two
houses
have
to
be
reapportioned
on
the
basis
of
population.
but
they
did
require
one
house
under
the
counsel
for
the
state
has
stated
that
the
fact
that
they
applied
the
federal
analogy.
mr.
frank
t.
cash
that
was
done
by
the
--
mr.
frank
t.
cash
let
me
emphasize
the
state
assembly
has
never
took
the
initiative.
they
did
not
act
at
all
in
the
sanders
versus
gray
case
on
the
county
used
them
until
the
decision
of
this
--
not
this
court
but
the
lower
court.
they
did
not
act
in
the
toombs
case
until
the
decision
of
the
toombs
case.
they
will
not
act
in
this
case
until
the
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
frank
t.
cash
i
think
it
is.
mr.
frank
t.
cash
i'm
not
aware
of
any
--
i
think
i
believe
the
--
it's
closed
to
maybe
the
--
the
segregation
cases
of
this
court,
i
think
the
apportionment
cases
are
met
with
very
favorable
response
upon
the
people
because
after
all,
we're
trying
to
sustain
the
rights
of
the
majority.
mr.
frank
t.
cash
yes.
mr.
frank
t.
cash
in
my
opinion
and
i
think
that's
based
--
i
think
the
counsel
for
state
would
--
would
see
that,
and
i
think
it
actually
did.
i'd
like
to
direct
myself
to
the
question
of
whether
this
court
ought
to
go
ahead
and
act
in
the
premises
now
and
not
wait
until
a
fuller
time
has
been
given
to
the
state
to
act.
it
seems
that
the
best
reason
that
the
appellants
can
set
forth,
why
they're
entitle
to
a
decision
now,
has
been
set
forth
by
judge
bell
in
both
the
sanders
versus
gray
case
and
also
in
--
in
the
lower
court
of
this
--
in
this
--
in
the
court's
opinion
below
in
this
matter.
first
is
that
in
the
sanders
versus
gray
case,
he
said,
“due
consideration
has
been
given
to
delaying
the
entry
of
an
injunction
until
the
next
regular
session
of
the
general
assembly
in
january.
but
having
recognized
that
the
constitutional
right
of
plaintiff,
we
cannot
fail
to
protect
it,
nor
do
we
believe
the
state
would
want
to
deny
it.
and
any
--
in
the
lower
court
of
in
this
matter
he
said,
“the
defendants
are
entitled
to
their
due,
a
final
decision.”
we
submit
that
we
too
are
entitled
to
a
final
decision.
the
question
presents
itself
if
the
present
apportionment
statute
is
declared
unconstitutional,
what
is
the
remedy?your
honors,
the
remedy
as
suggested
by
this
court
in
earlier
cases,
one
that
would
be
suggested
by
the
article
i,
section
2
itself
would
be
the
at
large
election.
the
--
in
fact,
the
judicial
remedy
of
congressional
district
cases
is
of
course
very
clear,
simple
and
moderately,
namely,
that
of
course
the
election
at
large
and
that
the
reason
for
this
could
be
certainly
justified
and
that
the
ordering
of
an
election
at
large
of
defendant
state's
congressional
delegation,
can
be
resolved,
it
can
be
at
any
time
that
the
defendant
state
chooses
to
apportion,
the
state
on
constitutional
--
on
a
constitutional
basis
then
there
would
no
longer
be
any
reason
for
an
at
large
election.
the
congress
--
that
would
be
based
upon
if
--
if
every
state
was
required
to
have
an
election
at
large,
congress
would
still
be
congress
formed
according
to
constitution.
it
would
be
able
to
function
normally
no
matter
how
many
congressmen
at
large.
and
the
most
important,
the
people
of
all
the
states
and
all
of
the
people
of
each
state
would
be
fully
represented.
the
bylaws,
that
is
the
interstate
local
representation,
of
course,
we
don't
feel
it
is
the
first
order
importance,
certainly
not
when
it's
in
direct
conflict
with
constitutional
rights.
and
of
course,
as
i
said
before,
it
can
be
regained
by
--
at
the
bargain
price
of
redistrict
--
redistricting.
the
most
convincing
and
persuasive
argument
for
this
remedy
of
course
is
that
it
is
an
opportunity
to
afford
everyone
equality
of
representation.
the
state
has
raised
the
question
and
i
think
it's
a
very
good
question
that
is,
if
the
relief
that
we
ask
for
this
court
--
of
this
court,
what
would
be
the
result
with
the
make
up
of
congress?
of
course
the
figure
cited
by
the
state
demonstrate
that
the
problem
of
grossly
unrepresentative
congressional
district
is
national
in
scope
and
threatens
to
undermine
the
basic
principle
of
equal
popular
representation
which
the
house
of
representation
was
originally
founded.
it
emphasizes
the
need
for
immediate,
uniform
and
a
final
solution,
which
only
this
court
is
capable
of
granting.
your
honors,
we
respectfully
submit
that
we
have
set
forth
a
cause
of
action,
we
have
set
forth
the
facts
at
the
trial,
we
have
had
our
day
in
court,
we
now
would
like
an
adjudication
of
our
rights.
