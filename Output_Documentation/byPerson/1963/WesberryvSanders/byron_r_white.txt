justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
terris,
what
if
the
court
below
had
mentioned
--
don't
--
had
not
dismissed
the
case,
it
has
retained
jurisdiction
and
--
and
had
said
only,
"we
think
this
is
a
rather
arbitrary
districting",
which
it
had
said.
but
said,
we
think
the
--
let's
use
one
of
its
factors,
that
the
state
legislature
we
think,
since
as
we've
ordered
it
be
--
to
be
reapportioned
we'll
provide
an
adequate
remedy
so
we
will
not
dismiss,
we'll
just
hold,
we'll
just
hold
the
case,
would
you
be
here
saying
the
same
thing
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
supporting
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
you
would
think
that
if
this
case
--
if
--
if
your
view
prevailed,
that
it
would
be
perfectly
adequate
for
the
court
below
on
remand
to
say
by
the
court's
order
does
not
to
dismiss
since
it
isn't
dismissed,
period.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
but
you
would
be
satisfied
in
the
lower
court,
if
the
lower
court
had
said,
based
on
our
knowledge
of
this
--
of
the
local
situation
here,
we
need
not
make
an
adjudication
on
the
merits
at
this
time.
we
shall
just
hold
it
and
wait
for
the
legislature.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
support
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
of
course
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
not.
you
should
--
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
support
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
only
mistake
the
court
made
below
in
your
view
is
dismissing
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
dismissed
--
it
dismissed
below
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
not
urging
this
court
to
order
the
lower
court
to
adjudicate
this
case
on
the
merits
at
this
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
a
--
without
an
adjudication
on
the
merits
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
by
the
courts
staring
it
in
the
federal
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
yes,
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
but
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
