you
don't
--
you
don't
take
issue
with
the
fact
that
his
departure
was
an
execution
of
the
order
--
order
of
deportation?
justice

understand
that.
justice

suppose

justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
what
were
the
--
what
was
he
legally
permitted
to
do
when
he
took
that
ship
to
san
pedro,
california?
justice
potter
stewart
so
far
as
--
so
far
as
coming
back
into
this
country?
justice
potter
stewart
just
as
a
--
as
any
foreign
sailor,
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
indication
that
he
knew
the
destination
of
this
vessel
when
it
sailed
away
from
san
pedro
in
1942?
justice
potter
stewart
as
the
--
when
you're
drawing
on
your
recollection
of
that
era,
i'm
drawing
on
my
own
recollection
of
that
era,
sailors
just
didn't
know
where
their
ships
were
going
because
this
was
a
matter
of
security.
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
were
not
told.
justice
potter
stewart
even
junior
officers
were
not
told.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
all
i
did
though
is
to
give
them
rights
equivalent
to
other
foreign
seamen
who
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
has
been
deported
from
this
country.
justice
potter
stewart
or
excludable
from
this
country.
justice
potter
stewart
they
just
gave
them
up
to
30-day
shore
leave,

justice
potter
stewart
--
otherwise
been
shore
leave.
justice
potter
stewart
thereafter,
your
point
is,
he
was
ordered
deported
in
a
proceeding
of
which
simply,
he
obviously
had
complete
notice.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
left
the
country
and
he
could
not
thereafter
lawfully
return
here
to
live.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
that
interrupted
his
residence
in
this
country?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
but
he
could
not
lawfully
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
(voice

in
this
country
to
live,
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
despite
two
deportation
orders.
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
you
--
i
didn't
understand
you
to
be
arguing
that
he
was
sent
home.
you
just
told
us
where
his
home
was,
where
his
wife
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
three
children
were.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
you
on
your
earlier
arguments
ms.
lowenstein,
to
concede
--
to
concede
that
when
he
left
his
country,
it
was
an
exit
--
it
was
an
--
it
was
tantamount
to
the
execution
of
the
order
of
deportation.
justice
potter
stewart
you've
said
that
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
you
are
not.
justice
potter
stewart
where
--
where
is
his
wife
and
three
children
now?
justice
potter
stewart
they
are
waiting
for
him
to
come
back
to
yugoslavia?

the
