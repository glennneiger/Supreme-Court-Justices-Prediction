mr.

mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
section
249
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
as
amended
in
1958,
authorizes
the
attorney
general
in
his
discretion
to
create
records
of
lawful
admission
for
permanent
residence
for
certain
long
time
resident
aliens
in
the
united
states
where
a
record
of
admission
for
permanent
residence
is
not
otherwise
available
and
where
the
alien
in
question
establishes
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
attorney
general
that
he
has
met
each
of
the
specified
eligibility
requirements.
to
be
eligible
for
section
249
relief
registry
as
it
some
time
is
called,
the
applicant
must
establish
that
he
entered
the
united
states
prior
to
june
28th,
1940
and
then
he
has
resided
in
this
country
continuously
since
that
entry.
section
101
(a)
(33)
of
the
1952
act
defines
residence
as
the
place
of
general
abode,
meaning,
the
principal
actual
dwelling
place
in
fact
without
regard
to
intent.
now,
petitioner's
application
for
registry
was
denied
by
the
respondent
in
april
1960
on
the
ground
that
his
1942
deportation
operated
as
a
severance
of
his
--
of
the
continuity
of
his
residence
in
the
united
states
for
purposes
of
statutory
eligibility.
the
regional
commissioner
in
burlington,
vermont
affirmed
this
determination
and
the
lower
court
also
sustained
it.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
as
we
view
it
is
simply
this,
whether
the
departure
of
the
petitioner
from
the
united
states
in
october
1942,
as
a
crewman
on
board
in
yugoslav
vessel
after
entry
of
an
order
of
deportation
to
yugoslavia.
and,
the
subsequent
absence
of
some
84
days
during
which
the
vessel
in
which
he
departed
docked
at
two
foreign
ports,
interrupted
the
continuity
of
his
residence
in
the
united
states
for
purposes
--
for
purposes
of
statutory
eligibility
under
249.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
he
was
deported
from
the
united
states
mr.
justice
goldberg.
and
under
section
1
(b)
of
the
act
of
march
4th,
1929,
any
alien
ordered
deported
who
has
departed
from
the
united
states,
congress
specified
that
this
shall
be
a
deportation
irrespective
of
the
country
to
which
he
has
departed.
now,
this
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
--
this
petitioner
mr.
justice
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
no
your
honor.
we
treat
this
as
a
voluntary
deportation
case.
we
distinguished
between
the
enforced
or
the
compelled
ejection
by
the
government,
the
voluntary
deportation,
and
then,
there
is
the
third
category
of
voluntary
departure
in
lieu
of
deportation
where
voluntary
departure
is
present
which
is
a
privilege
granted
by
the
administrative
officials.
that
is
not
regarded
as
a
deportation.
there
is
no
outstanding
order
of
deportation
in
question
and
should
he
return
to
the
united
states,
he
could
not
be
prosecuted
for
illegal
reentry.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes
sir,
a
voluntary
deportation,
a
self-deportation,
so
to
speak.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
well,
he
deported
himself
your
honor
from
the
united
states
to
a
foreign
place.
and
the
foreign
place
in
this
particular
situation
was
chile.
the
boat
reached
chile.
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
got
off
at
chile
but
the
statute
does
not
require
him
to
get
off
the
boat
and
to
establish
a
residence
in
a
foreign
country.
as
long
as
there
is
an
--
it
turns
on
objective
considerations
as
we
view
it
mr.
justice
goldberg,
has
an
order
of
deportation
been
entered?
and
if
so,
has
he
departed
from
the
united
states.
and
the
courts
have
said
that
when
those
two
conditions
are
present,
this
--
i
mean,
that
is
a
voluntary
deportation.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
i
didn't
hear
that
mr.
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
no,
we
would
not.
under
section
249
mr.
justice
goldberg,
temporary
absences
from
the
united
states
do
not
interrupt
the
continuity
of
the
residence
and
they
are
credited
to
you,
administrative
holdings
to
that
effect
where
temporary
stays
abroad
have
--
have
no
adverse
bearing
on
a
claim.
but,
the
crucial
difference
in
this
case
that
a
deportation
order
was
entered
and
he
did
leave
and
every
case
that
we
have
been
able
to
find
on
the
subject.
the
uniform
administrative
interpretations,
corsetti
versus
mcgrath,
the
illegal
reentry
prosecutions,
united
states
versus
maisel
which
i
would
like
to
get
to
court
a
little
later.
have
all
reached
the
conclusion
that
if
there
is
an
order
of
deportation
and
a
departure
from
the
united
states
after
that
order,
that
is
a
deportation
and
that's
what
the
statute
says
and
congress
specifically
mr.
justice
goldberg,
on
page
11,
footnote
--
footnote
7
if
i
may
read
a
portion
of
the
footnote
to
the
court.
owing
to
the
inadequacy
of
the
appropriations
now
made
for
enforcement
of
deportation
provisions
under
existing
law,
the
department
of
labor
has
in
many
cases
after
a
warrant
of
deportation
has
issued
restrained
from
executing
the
warrant
and
deporting
the
alien
at
the
expense
of
the
appropriation
to
the
country
to
which
he
might
be
deported,
upon
the
condition
that
the
alien
voluntarily
at
his
own
expense
leave
the
united
states.
some
doubt
exists,
whether
an
alien
so
departing
has
been
deported.
subsection
(b)
of
section
3
of
the
bill
therefore
removes
any
possible
doubt
on
this
question
by
providing
that
in
such
cases,
the
alien
shall
be
considered
to
have
been
deported
in
pursuance
of
law.
so
we
submit,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
where
the
order
of
deportation
has
been
entered
and
there
has
been
a
departure
from
the
united
states
to
a
foreign
place
that
that
executes
the
order
of
deportation
and
constitutes
a
voluntary
--
excuse
me
--
a
valid
voluntary
deportation
under
the
law
as
congress
intended.
and
this
has
been
carried
forward
in
section
101
(g)
of
the
1952
act.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
excuse
me.
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
oh,
could
i
give
the
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
if
i
may
recite
just
a
few
of
the
facts
in
the
exhibit
to
familiarize
the
court
with
the
facts
surrounding
his
residence
in
the
united
states.
he
entered
in
january
1940
as
a
crewman
on
board
a
yugoslav
vessel.
he
was
given
shore
leave
and
he
overstayed
that
leave
and
was
subsequently
ordered
deported
from
the
united
states.
this
was
on
september
4th,
1942.
a
month
later,
he
departed
from
the
united
states
on
this
voyage,
remained
away
84
days.
he
was
subsequently
on
december
31st,
1942
readmitted
for
hospi
--
or
for
medical
treatment.
and
the
hearing
officer
in
1952
then
noted,
that
for
the
next
seven
--
for
the
next
period
of
more
than
seven
consecutive
years,
he
remained
unnoticed
in
this
country.
apparently
in
1952,
we
caught
up
with
him
and
a
deportation
proceedings
were
instituted
against
him.
he
was
found
deportable
but
was
given
the
privilege
of
voluntary
departure.
this
was
by
the
hearing
officer
in
1952.
that
was
affirmed
by
the
assistant
commissioner.
and
then
in
1954,
may
26th,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
upheld
this
and
upheld
the
grant
of
voluntary
departure.
now,
the
petitioner
pursuant
to
this
voluntary
departure
privilege
did
not
leave
the
united
states.
he
was
given
until
may
9th,
1954
to
depart
and
he
did
not
leave.
we
extended
that
to
december
19th
and
he
did
not
leave.
on
december
20th,
1954,
an
order
of
deportation
to
yugoslavia
was
entered
against
him.petitioner
then,
retained
new
counsel
and
then
moved
to
reopen
the
deportation
proceedings
and
he
sought
for
the
privilege
of
that
voluntary
departure
again.
this
was
denied
and
then
stays
were
given
pending
this.
however,
in
august
of
1956,
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
which
through
the
outstanding
order
of
deportation
had
granted
him
the
privilege
of
voluntary
departure.
he
did
not
depart
at
that
time
even.
and
subsequently,
an
order
of
deportation
was
entered
on
october
19th,
1959.
and
shortly
thereafter,
he
obtained
new
counsel
and
then
instituted
the
registry
proceedings.
now,
if
i
may
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
that's
correct
sir
and
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes
sir,
right.
from
the
denial
of
this
proceeding.
in
this
--
this
registry
proceeding
mr.
justice
brennan
was
denied
on
the
ground
that
as
i've
indicated,
it
was
1942
deportation
severed
the
continuity
of
his
residency.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
and
i
--
as
i
will
indicate
a
little
later,
deportation
is
basically
inconsistent
with
the
retention
of
residence
in
the
country.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes
mr.
justice
clark,
right.
he
would
have
to
establish
statutory
eligibility
in
order
to
be
in
a
position
where
the
attorney
general
could
favorably
exercise
discretion.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
that's
correct
sir.
attorney
general
could
still
turn
him
down.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
that's
correct.
that's
correct
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
mr.
justice
goldberg,
the
policy
of
the
immigration
service
during
world
war
ii
was
to
allow
these
overstayed
crewmen
to
depart
voluntarily
in
lieu
of
deportation
if
they
were
willing
to
do
so.
because
we
had
a
tremendous
problem
and
the
deporta
--
or
the
crewman
overstaying
the
shore
leave
was
--
was
quite
a
tremendous
problem.
ships
were
tied
up
in
the
harbor
and
if
they
were
willing
to
reship,
we
allow
them
to
reship.
subsequently
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
--
and
if
they
refuse
to
reship
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
that's
correct
sir.
now,
if
they
refuse
to
reship
or
made
no
effort
to
do
so,
then,
deportation
proceedings
would
be
entered
--
would
be
instituted
against
them.
and
they,
pursuant
to
the
practice
which
i
will
allude
to
a
little
later
mr.
justice
goldberg,
they
were
deported
to
england
where
their
provisional
governments
were
located.
and
this
arrangement
was
satisfactory
to
england
and
also
to
the
provisional
governments.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes
sir,
right.
and
this
appears
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
the
debates
and
also
the
hearings
to
the
act
of
july
13th,
1943
which
allowed
--
which
specifically
sanctioned
this
type
of
war
time
practice.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
well,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
the
order
of
deportation
was
entered
against
him
in
september
4th,
1942.
on
october
6th
--
well,
shortly
thereafter,
he
left
his
new
york
residence,
his
new
york
employment,
traveled
to
the
west
coast
and
obtained
a
--
obtained
employment
on
board
this
yugoslav
vessel.
and
the
deportation
forms
were
filled
out
and
it
was
noted
that
he
had
a
yugoslav
passport.
and
then,
he
reshipped.
now,
he
reshipped
foreign
32
days
after
entry
of
the
order.
and
his
reshipment
was
verified
by
an
immigration
officer
who
marked
the
warrant
as
executed
and
the
new
york
office
was
notified
that
the
petitioner
had
a
reship
form.
now,
since
this
happens
so
quickly
after
entry
of
the
order,
32
days
and
he
had
made
these
preparations
perhaps
three
weeks
after
it
entered
the
order.
there
was
no
occasion
for
the
government
to
take
steps
and
have
him
sent
to
england.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
right.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
the
only
difference
mr.
justice
goldberg
is
that
he
would
not
reship
until
after
an
order
of
deportation
had
been
entered.
then
when
he
did
so,
that
reshipment
after
entry
of
the
order
constituted
in
law
a
deportation.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes
sir,
right.
he
reshipped
for
and
after
entry
of
the
order,
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
right
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
the
--
before
the
--
the
last
deportation
order
was
entered?
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
one
of
october
of
1959?
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
well,
the
1942
deportation
order,
that
does
not
appear
in
the
record
mr.
justice
white.
on
his
registry
forms,
he
indicated
the
--
that
he
was
working
in
new
york
city
and
he
was
living
in
new
york
city
at
that
time.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes
sir,
right.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
order
deported
and
new
york
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
i
--
the
immigration
service
has
provided
me
with
the
transcript
of
the
proceedings,
the
1942
proceedings
which
are
not
in
the
record.
and
i
will
--
i
would
not
go
outside
of
the
record
unless
the
court
specifically
requests
it.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes
sir,
right.
and
if
i
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
our
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
no
sir.
authorizing
him
to
reenter
the
unites
states
from
time
to
time
as
a
bona
fide
crewman,
you
see.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
that
was
entered
mr.
justice
black
in
the
order
of
--
in
the
warrant
of
deportation.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
well,
that
would
be
september
4th,
1942
and
that
would
--
would
be
32
days
before
he
left.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
a
waiver
under
the
ninth
proviso,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
right.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
well,
he
--
he
was
--
he
was
ordered
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
a
right
to
reenter
not
in
an
absolute
sense
mr.
justice
black,
but
a
right
to
reenter
as
a
crewman.
you
see,
section
3
of
the
1917
act
said
or
specified
the
classes
of
aliens
who
were
excludable
from
the
united
states.
and
the
1929
act
said,
if
you
had
been
previously
ordered
deported
and
have
left,
you
are
in
a
deportable
category
and
you
are
excluded
from
reentry.
now,
he
came
here
as
a
crewman
and
he
left
as
a
crewman
and
we
said
simply
provided
in
the
ninth
proviso
that
if
you
should
ever
return
from
time
to
time
and
are
eligible
for
short
leave
except
for
prior
deportation,
excludability
from
prior
deportation.
but
this
basis
of
inadmissibility
was
waived
so
that
if
you
are
otherwise
entitled
to
short
leave,
if
you're
a
bona
fide
seaman,
you
can
reenter
for
temporary
short
leave
purposes.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes
sir,
right.
just
for
shore
leave.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
not
a
general
admission,
no
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
generally
speaking,
during
the
war
years
mr.
justice
clark,
when
crewmen
had
been
deported
to
england
or
have
effected
their
own
deportations,
it
was
the
practice
of
the
service
to
include
in
the
warrants
of
deportation
this
waiver
and
waiver
under
the
ninth
proviso
so
that
they
could
return
to
our
shores
and
obtain
shore
leave.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes,
right.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
it
--
it
placed
them
inexcludable
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
right,
right.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes,
sir.

mr.
richard
w.
schmude
of
our
brief,
sir.
if
i
may
read
the
--
read
along
with
the
court,
this
particular
waiver
under
the
ninth
proviso.
if
the
alien
returns
to
the
united
states
from
time
to
time
and
upon
inspection,
is
found
to
be
a
bona
fide
seaman
and
entitled
to
shore
leave
except
for
prior
deportation,
admission
under
the
ninth
proviso
of
section
3
of
the
act
of
february
5th,
1917.
in
reference
to
this
ground
of
inadmissibility
is
hereby
authorized
for
such
time
as
the
alien
maybe
admitted
as
a
seaman.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
except
for
prior
deportation.
you
see,
if
he's
found
to
be
a
bona
fide
seaman
and
entitled
to
shore
leave,
except
for
prior
deportation.
and
under
the
1929
act,
mr.
justice
harlan,
a
--
a
deported
person
was
inadmissible
on
his
return.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
he
would
commit
a
felony
if
he
reentered
without
permission.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
right.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
there's
nothing
in
the
record
mr.
justice
goldberg
and
as
i've
indicated,
i
have
the
transcript
of
the
1942
proceedings
but
those
that
--
that
particular
transcript
is
not
in
the
record.
so,
the
record
does
not
show
that
he
was
specifically
advised
of
this.
and
of
course,
he
was
present
at
the
deportation
hearing
and
he
knew
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
he
knew
he
was
under
an
order
of
deportation.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
this
was
a
routine
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
this
was
a
routine
form
that
was
completed
in
these
types
of
cases,
form
535.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
under
the
regulations
at
that
time.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
the
form
was
placed
in
his
file,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
in
--
in
the
immigration
file,
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that,
sir,
no.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
the
right
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
well
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
well,
he
was
given
a
hearing
in
the
summer
of
19th
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
were
--
were
they
in
--
in
need
sir?
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
well,
there
were
some
dangers
and
--
and
i
believe
that
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
well,
there
were
shortages
of
seamen,
that's
true,
mr.
justice
black.
but
the
point
i'm
making,
mr.
justice
black,
is
that
he
was
given
a
hearing
in
1942.
he
was
ordered
deported
and
--
and
certainly,
he
knew
that
he
was
under
an
order
of
deportation
and
--
and
his
conduct
in
leaving
in
his
employment
and
--
and
his
residence
in
new
york
city,
going
to
the
west
coast.
he's
a
yugoslav
national.
he
signs
up
on
board
a
yugoslav
vessel
and
he
goes
and
these
objective
considerations
under
section
1(b)
of
the
1929
act,
constituted
deportation.
there
was
an
order
entered
and
he
left.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
and
he
knew
of
the
order.
i
--
i
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes
sir.
when
he
came
back,
the
ship
arrived
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
the
statute
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
that
was
special
permission,
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
it
must
have
been
the
--
the
immigration
officials
at
the
port
of
entry
in
san
francisco.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
the
record
doesn't
show
it,
mr.
justice
brennan.
he
testified
in
1952
that
he
came
off
the
ship
and
he
was
sick
and
--
and
they
let
him
come
in.
and
the
hearing
officer
made
a
finding
of
fact
that
he
was
admitted,
not
as
a
bona
fide
seaman
but
as
a
person
entitled
or
a
person
for
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
--
an
actual
medical
treatment.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes,
it
did.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
no,
sir.
he
was
ordered
deported
on
the
ground
that
he
was
an
overstayed
crewman
and
he
deserted
his
ship.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
well,
he
overstayed.
the
first
shore
leave
by
about
a
year
and
a
half.
we
caught
up
with
him
and
ordered
him
deported
and
he
left
pursuant
to
that.
and
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
sure.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
right.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
he
could
--
he
could
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
right.
if
he
--
if
he
returned
as
a
bona
fide
seaman
and
was
entitled
to
shore
leave,
except
for
that
prior
deportation,
we
waive
that
prior
deportation.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
he
could
not
lawfully
become
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
right.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
right.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
that's
correct,
right.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
i
--
i
wish
the
record
was
more
specific
on
this
point,
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
is
not.
it's
just
his
testimony
that
he
was
admitted
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
--
bona
fide.
the
statutes
and
the
regulations
in
effect
stated
that
where
the
admission
was
for
hospitalization
or
for
medical
treatment
purposes
that
this
was
simply
a
temporary
admission
and
that
he
was
expected
to
reship.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
that
point
arise
--
arose,
mr.
justice
brennan
when
he
had
fully
recuperated
from
his
illness.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
no,
it
doesn't.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
right,
sir.
well,
actually,
in
1954,
proceedings
in
1952.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
right.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
right,
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
right.
despite
--
despite
three
deportation
orders.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
and
we'd
given
him
voluntary
departure
and
he
won't
and
had
--
he
has
not
left.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
right.
if
--
if
i
could
--
if
it
please
the
court,
turn
to
the
impact
of
these
events
upon
the
petitioner's
claim
of
continuous
residence.
we
submit
that
his
deportation
operated
to
terminate
his
prior
residence
in
the
united
states.
we
submit
that
deportation
and
the
retention
of
residence
in
the
united
states
are
mutually
incompatible.
as
this
court
has
held
on
many
occasions,
deportation
is
simply
the
removal
from
the
united
states
of
particular
aliens
after
exclusion
or
expulsion
proceedings.
one
cannot,
we
submit,
without
negativing
the
purpose
and
essential
character
of
deportation
retain
a
principle,
actual
dwelling
place,
in
fact,
in
a
place
from
which
he
has
been
physically
and
lawfully
excluded
and
to
which
he
has
no
right
to
return.
moreover,
the
1929
act,
as
amended,
provided
that
a
deported
person
was
excludable
from
the
united
states
and
that
if
he
reentered
or
attempted
to
reenter
united
states,
he
was
subject
to
the
rigors
of
a
felony
prosecution
for
which
he
could
be
imprisoned
of
up
to
two
years.
it
would
be
inconceivable,
we
submit,
for
congress
to
have
intended
that
a
deported
person
could
ret
--
could
retain
a
residence
in
the
united
states.
but
that
any
attempt
on
his
part
to
physically
come
to,
resume
or
be
found
at
that
residence
would
result
in
the
commission
of
a
felony.
finally,
we
submit
that
the
acceptance
of
the
petitioner's
position
would
attribute
to
congress
a
result
which
basically
is
inconsistent
with
section
330
of
the
1952
act.
section
330
of
that
act
simply
provides
that
honorable
service
by
resident
aliens
of
the
united
states
on
board
certain
american
vessels
shall
be
deemed
residence
and
physical
presence
for
purposes
of
--
of
naturalization
under
section
316.
since
service
on
board
foreign
vessels
may
not
be
counted
for
purposes
of
residence
under
the
naturalization
laws,
we
submit
that
it
would
not
square
with
the
statutory
scheme
for
the
petitioner
to
count
his
service
on
board
a
foreign
vessel
especially
after
entry
of
an
order
of
deportation
to
count
as
a
continuation
of
prior
residence
in
the
united
states
since
the
whole
object
of
registry
is
to
give
the
applicant
permanent
residence.
and
permanent
residence
as
the
court
well
knows
is
one
of
the
basic
prerequisites
to
naturalization.
for
our
concluding
note,
may
i
state
that
when
the
petitioner
departed
from
the
united
states
in
1942,
he
restored
himself
to
the
same
residence
status
that
he
had
prior
to
his
entry.
the
only
difference
being
that
when
he
left,
he
left
with
the
status
of
a
deportee
and
was
excludable
except
for
shore
leave
purposes.
he
entered
the
united
states
as
a
crewman
on
board
a
yugoslav
vessel.he
departed
from
the
united
states
as
a
crewman
on
board
a
yugoslav
vessel.
if
he
had
a
permanent
residence
after
deportation,
it
was
his
home
on
the
island
of
(inaudible)
in
yugoslavia
where
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
well
he
had
a
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
i'm
--
i'm
stating
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
he
simply
had
a
permanent
residence
in
yugoslavia
where
he
had
a
wife
and
three
children,
and
he
was
supporting
that
wife
and
three
children
during
this
period.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
that's
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
that's
correct.
and
--
and
we
say,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
congress
with
the
--
with
section
1
(b)
of
the
act
of
march
4th,
1929,
placed
objective
considerations
on
a
departure
after
an
order
of
deportation.
if
--
if
an
order
has
been
entered
and
he
departs,
congress
specifically
said
that
is
deportation.
and
we
submit
your
honor
that
if
he's
been
validly
deported
and
this
petitioner
was
that
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
continuation
of
residence.
a
deported
person
can't
have
a
residence
and
--
and
--
but
they
specifically
denied
the
right
to
come
to
that
residence
without
committing
a
felony.
the
two
are
mutually
incompatible.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yugoslavia
at
that
time
was
--
was
occupied
by
german
forces.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
i
imagine
that
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
how
could
he
have
gone
to
yugoslavia?
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
well,
there
was
quite
a
bit
of
guerilla
activity
going
on
at
that
time.
and
i
imagine
that
--
that
there
might've
been
a
way
to
smuggle
him
in.
i
understand
that
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
he
--
he
might
have
sir.
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
right.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
but
he
had
a
government
in
england
and
we
were
deporting
people
to
yu
--
to
england
where
the
probational
government
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
well
he's
--
he
was
a
yugoslavia
national,
mr.
justice
black
and
the
yugoslav
government
cabinet
had
--
had
gone
to
england
and
was
stationed
in
england
at
this
time
operating
with
their
maritime
courts
and
they
specifically
received
back
seamen.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
there's
a
statement
to
that
effect
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioner
your
honor
but
the
--
my
research
has
disclosed
that
under
sections
3,
the
third
and
fourth
paragraphs
of
section
3
of
the
treaty
of
rapallo
of
november
11th,
1920
between
italy
and
yugoslavia.
yugoslavia
or
italy
obtained
only
four
islands
in
the
adriatic
although
they
had
been
promised
many
islands
including
the
petitioner's
islands
in
the
secret
treaty
of
london
in
1915.
so
this
did
not
actually
change
hands
in
the
hist
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
he
was
born
on
the
island
of
(inaudible),
which
is
in
the
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
austria-hungary,
right.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
well
if
--
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
well
after
world
war
i,
the
--
the
empire
broke
up
and
the
new
kingdom
of
the
serbs,
croats
and
slovenes
was
setup
and
italy
claimed
these
offshore
islands
and
all
of
dalmatia,
but
these
claims
were
not
realized
or
partially
realized
until
the
treaty
of
rapallo.
and
at
that
point,
italy
obtained
just
four
islands
in
the
eastern
peninsula
of
yugoslavia
and
the
town
of
zadar.
and
that
was
about
it.
and
yugoslavia
retained
the
rest
of
the
islands.
mr.
richard
w.
schmude
yes,
sir,
i'd
be
glad
to
do
that
claim.
thank
you
very
much
sir.
