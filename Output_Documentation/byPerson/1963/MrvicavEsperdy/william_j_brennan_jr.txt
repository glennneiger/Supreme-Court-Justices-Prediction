(inaudible)
rather
than
involuntary,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
only
--
this
is
only
because
the
departure
under
an
order
for
deportation
that
they've
presented.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
--
that's
the
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
--
is
it
that
--
it's
not
possible
to
have
this
voyage
considered
a
break
in
residence
because
the
voyage
was
from
san
francisco
to
chile
and
back
to
san
francisco,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
was
the
united
states
when
he
left.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
thought
--
i
thought
the
--
you
put
some
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
he
had
to
come
back
to
the
united
states.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
--
is
that
established?
did
he
have
to
come
back
to
the
united
states?
might
he
not
have
took
the
ship
in
chile?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
i
am
--
i
am
correct
in
appreciating
your
argument
to
be
that
there
could
have
been
no
break
in
united
states
residence
because
this
departure
was
a
departure
which
had
at
the
end
of
it
a
return
in
the
united
states.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
probably
hasn't
any
real
relevancy
but
i'm
just
curious.
how
does
this
thing
come
to
ahead
anyway?
this
didn't
come
about
sometime
in
1960?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
may
say
frankly,
this
seems
to
me
rather
a
technical
application
and
i
just
wonder
why
even
25
years
here,
why
are
you
sending
him
away?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
a
declaratory
judgment
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
1942.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
was
deported
while
living
in
new
york
city,
was
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ordered
deported.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
was
an
offer
to
reship
made
to
him
while
he
was
living
in
new
york
city?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
knew
of
the
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
i
gather
when
he
returned
to
san
francisco
and
departed
the
ship,
it
is
not
as
a
sailor
on
shore
leave
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
but
because
of
illness
or
something.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
just
wonder,
did
that
take
some
special
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
--
on
the
file
of
the
united
states
government
that
takes
some
special
permission
or
what.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
who
gave
that,
that's
what
i'm
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
was
he
hospitalized
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
admission
took
some
action
on
the
part
of
the
immigration
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
i
gather
because
he
was
granted
permission
to
leave
that
ship
because
of
illness.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
though
that
--
to
that
extent,
the
entry
at
that
time
from
the
ship
was
lawful,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
are
there
any
terms
of
that
entry,
any
time
limits
or
anything
else,
speaks
for
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
must
have
come
a
point
though
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
which
is
only
to
say
that
there
came
a
point
after
that
lawful
admission
when
his
con
--
continued
stay
here
was
unlawful.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
when
did
that
point
arise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
--
do
we
know
--
does
the
record
tell
us
when
this
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
as
far
as
this
is
concerned,
he
might
still
be
to
get
a
relief.
