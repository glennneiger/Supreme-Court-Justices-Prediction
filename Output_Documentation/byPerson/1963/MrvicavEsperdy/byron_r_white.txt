r.
white
did
he
arrive
back

white
--
where
was
the
ship
when
he
--
when
he
boarded
the
ship?
where
was
it
--
justice

r.
white
and
did
they
know
he's
going
to
come

you

was
no
place
to
go.
there
was
some
place
for
him

it's
just
that
on
this
trip
you
say
he
didn't
go
anywhere
else.
justice

r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
