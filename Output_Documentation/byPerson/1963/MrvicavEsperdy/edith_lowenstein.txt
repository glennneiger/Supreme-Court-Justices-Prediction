ms.
edith
lowenstein
if
it
please
the
court.
the
nature
of
this
case
is
--
is
strictly
one
of
statutory
construction,
of
construction
of
section
249
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
ivan
mrvica
filed
an
application
to
become
a
permanent
resident
of
the
united
states
under
that
provision.
section
249
which
incidentally
together
with
all
the
other
statutory
provisions
which
are
relevant
for
this
case
as
reproduced
on
pages
22
and
23
of
the
petitioner's
brief
provides
that
a
record
of
lawful
admission
for
permanent
residence
maybe
granted
to
aliens
who
entered
the
united
states
prior
to
june
28,
1940
who
have
had
residence
in
the
united
states
continuously
since
such
time,
persons
of
good
moral
character
and
not
ineligible
to
citizenship,
also,
who
are
not
of
certain
undesirable
categories.
now,
ivan
mrvica
came
to
the
united
states
in
19
--
in
january
of
1940.
he
was
born
in
dalmatia
which
at
that
time
of
his
birth
in
1906
was
a
part
of
austria,
hungary
but
which
later
became
yugoslav.
and
in
1939,
he
left
his
home
for
the
last
time
and
then
he
came
to
the
united
states.
shortly,
after
he
entered
the
united
states,
yugoslavia
was
overrun
by
the
germans
and
his
own
government,
the
yugoslavia
government
under
king
peter
went
into
exile
in
england.
in
1942,
mrvica
who
overstayed
and
decided
not
to
return
to
europe
was
placed
under
deportation.
and
at
that
time
was
also
--
when
he
was
found
deportable
as
an
overstayed
crewman,
granted
advance
permission
to
return
under
the
provision
of
the
1917
immigration
act.
such
permission
was
granted
in
order
to
do
--
enable
bona
fide
crewman
who
have
overstayed
to
return
to
the
united
states
without
--
without
encountering
the
felony
of
entering
without
permission
after
deportation.
mrvica
voluntarily
departed
on
a
yugoslav
vessel
in
october
1942.
he
stayed
on
that
vessel
for
about
two
months
and
then
reentered
in
san
francisco
from
where
he
had
originally
come.
ms.
edith
lowenstein
that
was
a
war
time
trip.
ms.
edith
lowenstein
on
a
merchant
--
on
a
merchant
vessel
which
was
under
yugoslov
flag
and
at
that
time
i
would
say
that
who
was
really
the
government
of
yugoslavia
was
to
say
the
least,
a
very
murky
question
although
king
peter
was
in
england
and
apparently
was
recognized
but
there
were
mihailoviÄ‡
and
tito
fighting
in
yugoslavia
and
also
the
germans
had
occupied
yugoslavia
so
that
there
might
have
been
several
interpretations
of
who
was
really
in
charge
of
yugoslavia
at
that
time.
ms.
edith
lowenstein
yes.
i
think
that's
a
--
no
question
about
that.
now,
after
mrvica
returned
according
to
the
record,
he
was
admitted
for
medical
--
medical
treatment.
and
in
this
context
i
have
to
apologize
to
the
court
because
i
had
made
an
erroneous
statement
which
is
caused
by
the
fact
that
to
the
--
the
counsel
for
the
alien
at
some
times
is
rather
difficult
go
keep
our
effects
together
because
of
the
so-called
record
file
of
the
government
is
not
in
the
possession
of
a
counsel
for
the
alien
but
only
available
--
at
its
very
brief
for
--
to
the
assistant
united
states
attorney's
office
and
i
slipped
on
the
fact
that
actually
he
did
not
get
readmitted
as
a
crewman
but
rather
was
readmitted
for
medical
treatment.
i
also
took
from
one
of
the
opinions
in
the
case,
one
of
the
special
inquiry
of
these
opinions
that
he
was
an
italian
before
he
became
a
yugoslav
but
--
meanwhile,
researched
that
subject
and
i
believe
that
he
was
a
yugoslav
at
the
time
when
he
entered
the
united
states.
i
do
not
believe
that
any
of
these
facts
have
any
bearing
on
the
case
however
because
the
own
--
the
application
having
been
piled,
it
was
denied
by
the
government
on
the
ground
that
the
departure
under
order
of
deportation,
no
in
--
in
1942,
he
was
found
deportable
as
overstayed
crewman.
and
the
government
took
the
position
that
the
departure
under
the
order
of
deportation
which
executed
the
deportation
order
was
by
as
a
matter
of
law
and
interruption
of
the
residence,
of
the
continuous
residence
required
by
section
249.
now
the
--
before
i
--
ms.
edith
lowenstein
no.
i
don't
take
issue
with
that
and
i
think
it's
completely
irrelevant
to
the
--
ms.
edith
lowenstein
yes.
i
don't
take
issue
with
that.
the
law
is
very
clear
on
that.
ms.
edith
lowenstein
no.
because
--
because
i
do
believe
that
the
definition
of
the
statutes
of
what
is
residence
under
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
takes
away
all
the
elements
of
whether
it
was
voluntary,
involuntary
under
deportation
or
otherwise
because
section
101
(a)
(33)
as
shown
on
page
22
of
petitioner's
brief
defines
the
term
residence
as
a
place
of
general
abode.
the
place
of
general
abode
of
a
person
means
his
principal,
actual
dwelling
place
in
fact
without
regard
to
intent.
therefore
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
or
not,
an
--
dwelling
place
in
fact
can
be
terminated
by
what
i
consider
a
legal
fiction,
namely,
the
execution
of
a
deportation
order
or
whether
regardless
of
what
happens
to
the
deportation
order.
the
question
remains
whether
or
not
in
fact
the
petitioner
remained
in
the
united
states.
now,
in
this
connection
before
i
go
--
go
into
the
definition
of
residence
any
further,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
usually
in
discretionary
relief
requires
periods
of
physical
presence
rather
than
residence.
for
instance,
on
the
suspension
of
deportation,
persons
have
to
have
physical
presence
in
the
united
states
for
a
certain
period
of
time.
and
if
this
physical
presence
is
interrupted,
the
person
would
not
be
eligible
statutorily.
however,
this
particular
provision,
section
249
does
not
allude
to
physical
presence
but
only
to
residence
and
that
appears
to
me
--
it
makes
quite
a
difference
in
the
construction
of
this
statute.
the
definition
of
--
the
history
of
section
249
as
such,
that
the
fact
that
there
wasn't
interruption
of
the
physical
presence
as
well
as
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
was
illegally
in
the
united
states
should
not
militate
against
him.
the
immigration
service
and
the
government
in
general
has
gen
--
conceded
and
has
in
a
number
of
opinion
stated
that
an
alien
illegally
in
the
united
states
who
reenters
can
nevertheless
be
eligible
for
section
249
and
the
only
exemption
is
made
if
the
alien
departed
under
a
deportation
order.
now,
in
other
words,
if
the
petitioner
had
been
in
exactly
the
same
posture
he
was
without
a
deportation
proceeding,
if
he
had
sailed
out
and
return
in
the
same
manner,
there
would
be
no
question
that
he
would
be
eligible
for
the
relief.
and
it's
only
because
of
the
injection
of
the
deportation
order
that
the
residence
in
fact
is
alleged
to
be
interrupted.
now
prior
to
1958,
the
question
of
deportability
was
essential
because
the
law
prior
to
1958
precluded
a
person
who
was
deportable
from
exercising
the
right
of
adjustment
of
status
under
that
provision.
but
in
1958,
congress
deleted
this
particular
bar
from
the
statute
and
thereby
took
away
the
owners
from
illegal
presence.
nevertheless,
the
courts
below
both
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
and
on
the
second
circuit
as
well
as
in
the
first
circuit
and
on
the
ninth
circuit
have
supported
the
government's
position
that
a
person
who
departed
under
deportation
order
was
not
eligible
for
discretionary
relief.
and
all
of
them
agreed
with
the
government's
opinion
that
section
101
(g)
of
the
immigration
law
which
is
free
--
ms.
edith
lowenstein
no.
there's
no
view
at
least
--
at
least
which
i
have
found
with
this
contrary
but
unfortunately,
the
supreme
court
has
not
expressed
itself
to
that.
ms.
edith
lowenstein
well
that
is
what
is
said
but
i
--
ms.
edith
lowenstein
that's
the
argument
of
the
government.
ms.
edith
lowenstein
the
provision
in
the
law
which
is
being
use
as
for
the
purpose
of
this
act,
and
the
alien
ordered
departed
carries
out
his
deportation
order
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
there's
any
compelling
reason
that
this
would
be
admitted
into
the
concept
of
residence.
ms.
edith
lowenstein
yes.
he
never
--
the
record
does
not
indicate
and
i
--
i
happened
to
know
that
he
never
left
the
ship.
ms.
edith
lowenstein
it
was
on
the
west
coast
from
san
francisco
--
ms.
edith
lowenstein
to
south
america,
that's
the
west
coast.
he
went
--
he
went
to
chile
and
returned.
ms.
edith
lowenstein
i
assume
so.
there's
--
i
wouldn't
know
but
there
are
--
there
are
--
certainly
the
government
in
its
brief
indicated
that
during
the
war
we
departed
persons
to
england,
to
the
governments
in
exile,
but
i'm
sure
that
nobody
was
departed
--departed
from
san
francisco
to
england
during
the
war.
and
so
i
assumed
that
the
ship
just
followed
its
destined
route
and
that
--
that
there
was
absolutely
no
possibility,
practical
or
otherwise
that
he
could
have
gone
any
place
except
where
the
ship
went.
and
there
was
also
no
possibility
that
he
could
have
remained
on
the
ship
because
the
ship
just
went
back
to
san
francisco.
now
--
ms.
edith
lowenstein
well
--
ms.
edith
lowenstein
well,
theoretically
what
he
was
permitted
to
do
is
to
come
back
to
the
country
and
ship
out
within
30
days.
ms.
edith
lowenstein
as
any
foreign
seaman
and
that
he
didn't
do.
he
did
not
sail
out
again.
in
other
words,
he
overstayed
again
after
he
came
back.
but
--
and
the
court
below
seem
to
feel
that
since
at
the
later
dates,
in
1952
to
be
exact,
he
admitted
that
when
he
returned
he
only
wanted
to
ship
out
an
american
ship.
so
when
he
found
out
that
he
couldn't
ship
out
in
american
ships,
he
didn't
want
to
ship
out
at
all.
then
he
turned
out
to
be
a
mollified
crewmen
and
therefore
he
had
done
the
same
thing
twice,
namely
entered
in
violation
of
law.
the
court
below
stated
that
--
they
felt
that
one
couldn't
add
two
illegal
presences
together
and
make
one
continuous
residence
out
of
that.
however,
these
all
the
--
it
seems
to
me
mrs.
--
the
point
of
the
definition
of
residence
as
it
is
now
in
the
immigration
law.
and
in
this
context
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
rosenberg
versus
fleuti
which
has
been
decided
by
this
court
some
time
ago.
that
case
is
not
really
irrelevant
either
because
it
addresses
itself
to
an
--
a
construction
of
the
term
entry
under
section
101
(a)
(13)
of
the
statute.
and
there
the
court
ruled
that
the
proviso
of
the
term
entry
means
--
should
not
--
new
entry
should
not
be
applied
when
there
was
an
involuntary
entry
of
any
kind
when
the
alien
has
--
in
the
flow
of
this
case
was
unaware
of
the
consequences
of
this
act
and
was
a
casual
departure.
now,
i
do
not
want
to
draw
any
analogy
between
these
cases
particularly,
since
in
section
101
(a)
(13)
there's
a
proviso
which
says
that
the
exception
of
that
provision
does
not
apply
to
anybody
who
departs
under
a
deportation
order.
but
our
appeal
that
that
is
not
adverse
to
petitioner's
position
for
the
following
reason.
section
101
(a)
(13)
for
the
first
time
inserted
the
element
of
intent
and
the
definition
of
entry.
on
the
other
hand,
section
101
(a)
(33)
for
the
first
time
deleted
the
definite
--
the
existence
of
an
intent
from
the
definition
of
residence.
now
therefore,
while
in
the
fleuti
case,
it
was
quite
necessary
to
--
for
congress
to
express
its
opinion
on
involuntary
departure
because
it
would
have
been
very
easy
if
a
person
is
departed,
he
usually
leaves
involuntarily.
and
any
person
who
was
departed
could
then
turn
around
and
say,
"well,
i
came
back
and
i
didn't
make
a
new
entry
because
my
deportation
was
involuntary
and
therefore
i
come
within
the
exception
of
section
101
(a)
(13)."
therefore,
obviously
it
would
be
appropriate
to
put
that
proviso
in
here.
but
that
should
not
carry
over
in
the
definition
of
residence
because
there,
just
the
contrary
took
place,
namely,
the
element
of
intent
was
removed.
and
therefore
whether
mrvica
haven't
concealed
intention
to
return
and
to
remain,
or
whether
the
immigration
service
had
an
open
intention
to
get
rid
of
them
is
really
completely
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
whether
he
was
a
resident
of
the
united
states
because
that
was
purely
a
matter
of
fact.
now,
the
court
below
admitted
that
it
was
rather
difficult
to
visualize
and
then
taking
changing
residence
from
the
united
states
to
a
merchant
vessel
in
time
of
war
and
a
thing
that
he
transferred
as
residence
to
such
a
merchant
vessel
just
because
he
was
under
order
of
deportation.
the
government
seems
to
put
great
weight
on
it
that
this
particular
merchant
vessel
was
of
--
of
yugoslav
nationality.
i
think
that
also
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
case.
the
only
question
is
whether
it's
conceivable
that
the
man
could
have
gone
any
place
except
back
to
the
united
states.
and
the
facts
as
far
as
i
can
see
are
very
clear
on
that
he
could
not
have
gone
any
other
place
except
where
he
did
go,
namely
to
the
united
states.
now,
the
government
states
that
after
all
that
this
man
has
been
treated
very
kindly
has
been
here
for
25
years
because
nobody
was
tough
enough
to
deport
him
at
particular
time
under
this
presumptuous
of
him
now
to
ask
for
permission
to
remain
here
altogether.
now,
i
appeal
that
that
has
no
argument
at
all
in
connection
with
the
humanitarian
aspect
of
section
249.
because,
if
the
immigration
service
had
depart
--
deported
him
in
1942
and
had
deported
him
to
england,
he
might
be
dead
today
or
he
might
be
in
yugoslavia
and
very
miserable
but
he
would
not
be
in
the
responsibility
of
the
united
states.
but
he
has
been
permitted
to
remain
here
for
25
years
and
therefore
it
seems
to
me
that
the
statute
with
regard
to
the
point
of
residence
should
be
liberally
construed
in
his
favor
rather
than
against
him.
ms.
edith
lowenstein
well,
the
definition
of
residence
is
the
place
of
general
abode
and
the
place
where
the
man
had
its
principal
actual
dwelling
place
in
fact.
that
is
my
position.
ms.
edith
lowenstein
and
it
was
when
he
returned.
and
the
--
generally
speaking,
you
do
not
break
up
your
residence
by
temporary
absence.
ms.
edith
lowenstein
that
is
right.
and
then
--
ms.
edith
lowenstein
well,
he
didn't
get
off
the
ship
and
although
the
government
filed
--
said
something
about
that
he
had
a
yugoslav
passport
from
our
own
experience
with
these
so-called
yugoslav
passport
that
that's
a
paper
saying
that
he's
yugoslav
and
except
to
--
to
the
yugoslav
government
but
it
certainly
wouldn't
have
admitted
him
to
any
other
country.
there
is
no
passport
in
the
file.
i
haven't
seen
the
passport
and
as
the
man
himself
has
no
recollection
of
ever
having
had
a
passport.
ms.
edith
lowenstein
that
is
correct.
i
think
there
was
as
a
matter
of
fact,
no
other
way
for
him
to
end
his
voyage.
ms.
edith
lowenstein
well
if
it
--
i
had
been
to
england
and
england
had
accepted
him,
if
there's
evidence
that
england
would
have
accepted
him,
i
would
--
ms.
edith
lowenstein
well,
i
would
say
that
probably,
i
would
take
the
same
position
because
of
the
following
reasons.
the
general
definition
of
residence
is
that
--
that's
where
you
live.
now
the
fact
that
he
went
to
chile
instead
of
to
england
makes
really
no
difference
except
--
ms.
edith
lowenstein
well,
that's
quite
possible.
i
don't
think
that
that's
negates
my
position.
that's
only
unlikely
that
it
practically
would
happen.
and
actually
the
reason
why
his
position
is
stronger
than
such
a
person's
position
would
be
is
because
there
was
no
practical
possibility
for
him
to
go
any
place.
now,
there
are
cases
cited
in
the
government's
brief
which
say
that
it
is
perfectly
possible
to
establish
your
residence
on
a
foreign
vessel.
now
i
read
these
cases
and
i
feel
that
they
are
much
in
support
of
my
contention
because
on
all
of
these
situations,
the
man
spent,
let
us
say,
anywhere
between
12
--
10
months
on
the
vessel
and
two
months
in
the
united
states
or
he
spent
two
months
or
eight
weeks
in
the
united
states
and
the
rest
of
the
time
in
his
old
home
country.
and
--
ms.
edith
lowenstein
i
think
they
couldn't
deport
them
on
that
particular
trip
because
that
vessel
didn't
go
there.
ms.
edith
lowenstein
if
they
had
deported
them
to
england,
we
would've
another
set
of
facts
and
that
was
--
ms.
edith
lowenstein
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
edith
lowenstein
well,
that
is
what
the
government
says.
ms.
edith
lowenstein
i
have
no
knowledge.
ms.
edith
lowenstein
well,
i
have
no
knowledge
that
actually
people
were
deported
to
england
because
my
recollection
at
that
time
is
that
it
was
quite
difficult
to
get
ships
across
the
ocean
to
england.
and
they
said
(inaudible)
for
deportations
purposes,
they
carried
other
things.
but,
i
do
not
know
--
i
mean,
if
they
had
taken
him
to
england
and
england
had
accepted
him,
they
could've
deported
him.
but
i
think
in
this
case,
as
the
question
of
fact
and
the
record
does
not
indicate
that
she
had
any
possibility
of
this
type.
ms.
edith
lowenstein
well,
there's
nothing
in
the
record.
but
on
that
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
edith
lowenstein
that's
--
that's
quite
possible,
yes.
ms.
edith
lowenstein
but
that
--
well,
i
don't
know.
ms.
edith
lowenstein
no.
but
there
have
been
--
if
you're
in
san
francisco,
the
chances
that
you're
going
to
england
is
unlikely
in
--
ms.
edith
lowenstein
--
or
doing
that
period.
i
mean,
i
think
anybody
could've
figured
that
possibly
hard.
i
mean,
that's
perfectly
true
and
--
i
mean,
i
don't
know
anything
about
these
deportations
to
england.
and
i
don't
know
whether
this
--
well,
i
think
peter
was
among
the
people
who
were
rated
to
deportees
into
england.
i
have
no
idea
that
just
--
the
government's
case.
and
may
i
be
permitted
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
this?
ms.
edith
lowenstein
i
will
be
--
i
will
be
very
brief.
i
have
very
little
time.
i
know
that
but
i
would
like
to
say
one
or
two
things
about
the
man
and
his
history.
the
representation
of
the
government
although
was
basically
correct,
shows
it's
too
much
from
the
side
of
the
government.
now
on
page
four
of
the
petitioner's
brief
is
the
story
why
--
how
he
managed
to
stay
here
this
long.
but
in
our
present
discussion
neither
one
of
us
mentioned
that
the
petitioner
left
yugoslavia
before
yugoslavia
was
taken
over
by
the
communist.
the
petitioner
is
anticommunist,
he
is
a
catholic,
he
is
a
--
he
is
not
a
great
intellectual
and
has
no
general
ideas
on
marxism
but
he
does
not
want
to
go
back
to
a
communist
country.
and
during
the
1950s,
he
filed
an
application
for
stays
of
deportation
because
of
persecution
if
he
were
to
be
returned.
and
during
the
1950s,
the
commission
of
immigration
had
granted
such
a
blanket
stay
to
all
yugoslavs
who
made
such
a
claim.
so
that
that
was
part
of
the
delay.
also
i
would
like
to
say
that
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
he
in
a
sort
of
a
slippery
fashion
went
up
to
san
francisco
to
take
that
boat.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
say
by
the
heat
of
that
boat,
because
he
chooses
though
whether
the
government
told
him
to
go
to
san
francisco
and
take
it,
so
there's
no
indication
that
he
was
trying
to
out
facts
the
government
by
going
to
san
francisco.
also,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
the
comment
which
mr.
justice
goldberg
made
a
while
ago,
where
was
he
deported
to.
the
order
of
deportation
did
not
state
england.
the
order
of
deportation
stated
yugoslavia.
so
therefore
--
or
even
if
people
were
deported
to
england,
technically,
he
could
not
have
been
deported
to
england
because
he
was
either
deported
to
yugoslavia.
in
addition
to
that,
let
us
assume
that
when
he
left
the
ship
and
went
on
to
a
yugoslav
vessel,
he
went
to
chile
as
my
colleague
--
he
stated
that
as
a
foreign
part
of
place
that
he
had
gotten
off
the
ship.
but
its
certain,
it
was
not
the
destination
of
his
deportation
order
and
there's
no
indication
that
he
went
off
the
ship
or
that
he
could
have
gone
off
the
ship.
ms.
edith
lowenstein
that's
perfectly
correct.
i
--
i
concede
that
--
ms.
edith
lowenstein
--
because
i
think
that
is
irrelevant
to
the
position
--
ms.
edith
lowenstein
--
of
--
of
permanent
residence
--
i
mean
of
a
residence
in
the
united
states.
and
then
i
only
want
to
make
one
more
point
and
that
is
the
question
of
the
illegal
reentry.
i
mean
i
know
that
he
did
--
i
mean,
the
government
found
him
to
be
not
a
bona
fide
crewman
when
he
reentered.
that
however
was
only
brought
out
at
a
time
1952
when
he
applied
for
a
refugee
visa
and
admitted
that
he
didn't
want
to
leave,
that
he
would
like
to
remain
here.
that
is
--
was
decided
in
1952
that
he
was
not
a
bona
fide
crewman.
and
that's
almost
10
years
later.
now
--
while
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
special
inquiry
officer
may
have
said
that
he
was
not
noticed
during
these
10
years.
if
he
was
not
noticed,
it
was
not
because
he
was
hiding
out.
because
during
this
period,
he
had
deductions
from
his
income
taxes
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
a
deduction
from
his
income
taxes
in
the
record
which
is
filed
with
a
court
in
1944.
he
also
registered
with
selective
service
and
he
did
not
hide
out.
i
think
it
is
quite
possible
that
during
that
time,
the
immigration
service
had
a
certain
amount
of
sympathy
with
a
crewman
who
came
from
countries
which
were
overrun
by
the
enemy.
and
i
do
not
believe
that
it
was
necessarily
his
--
his
smartness
and
slyness
that
he
withdrew
himself
from
immigration
proceedings
for
10
years.
and
i
feel
that
since
he
now
has
been
here
for
10
years,
he
has
an
american
citizen
brother
and
all
as
soon
as
--
if
that
his
petition
should
be
granted
for
adjustment
of
status
and
that
he
--
ms.
edith
lowenstein
well,
they
are
waiting
for
him
to
become
admitted
and
then
they
would
join
him.
their
(inaudible)
--
their
applications
are
pending
--
(voice
overlap)
ms.
edith
lowenstein
excuse
me?
ms.
edith
lowenstein
no,
i
think
they're
waiting
to
come
over
here.
i
don't
think
--
i
think
they
are
all
are
very
unhappy.
so
i
ask
the
court
that
the
petition
will
be
granted.
