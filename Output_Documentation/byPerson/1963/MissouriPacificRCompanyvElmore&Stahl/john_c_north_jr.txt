mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
to
go
a
little
bit
further
into
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
involved
the
shipment
of
honeydew
melons
at
rio
grande
city
in
texas.
they
were
consigned
to
chicago,
illinois
in
1958.
the
car
arrived
in
a
damaged
condition.
i
have
never
been
able
to
determine
from
the
brief
what
judge
arnold
or
the
railroad
means
by
the
term
"spoilage".
to
me,
it's
an
all
inclusive
term.
if
you
drop
one
and
break
the
honeydew
melon
or
any
commodity,
it
breaks,
it's
spoiled.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
they
did
arrive
spoiled.
they
had
3%
decay
in
them
and
they
had
15%
discoloration.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
no,
sir.
the
testimony
was
not
conclusive
on
that
insofar
as
discoloration
was
concerned,
why,
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
for
the
railroad.
they
brought
one
down
from
new
york
all
the
way
to
testify.
he
was
an
expert
named
huss
(ph).
he
testified
as
did
sleigh
ww
(ph),
that's
a
western
land
inspection
bureau,
their
government
aids
or
inspection
agencies.
they
testified
that
they
associated
with
--
with
immaturity.
actually,
in
the
case,
they
had
some
other
melons
that
arrived
slightly
green
and
that's
the
melons
that
they
were
talking
about.
but
the
undisputed
evidence
in
this
case,
according
to
the
destination
inspection
was
that
they
were
mature.
in
fact,
the
word
"mature"
is
used
on
the
u.s.
government
destination
inspection
and
they
admitted
that
whether
they're
white
to
cream,
there
were
no
green
in
this,
white
to
cream,
well,
that
was
evidence
of
maturity.
the
only
other
evidence,
we
say,
that
bruising
follows
that
--
discoloration
and
decay
follows
bruising
and
they
bear
that
out
in
--
in
one
respect
in
that
they
say
slight
abrasions.
and
now,
when
they
say
slight
abrasions,
well,
that's
--
that's
just
discussed
--
placed
and
that
could
occur
in
transit.
they
infer
that
it
was
incurred
in
the
package
but
there
is
no
proof
on
that.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
absolutely.
we
have
no
finding
that
there
was
no
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
carrier.
actually,
there
were
three
issues.
one
was
a
little
inconsistent
but
we
make
no
point
to
that.
but
we
also
have
a
finding
by
the
jury
that
the
melons
were
in
a
worsen
condition
and
would
reasonably
be
anticipated
upon
their
arrival
in
chicago.
they
also
have
a
finding
by
the
jury
that
the
damage
was
not
due
to
an
inherent
vice.
they
also
have
a
finding
that
it
was
not
due
to
fault
of
shipper.
and
in
a
damage
issue,
the
--
they
discovered
again
what
is
the
value
at
the
time
and
in
the
condition
in
which
they
should've
arrived
if
transported
in
accordance
with
plaintiff's
instruction
and
the
reason
to
prove
the
matters
to
all
might
have
not
covered
by
those
instruction.
now,
every
one
of
those
other
issues,
the
railroad
would
have
us
disregard.
they
say
it's
a
case
of
inherent
vice.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
insofar
as
inherent
vice
is
concerned,
it's
not
clear
from
their
argument
whether
we
make
out
the
issue
of
inherent
vice
when
we
show
arrival
in
damage
condition
or
we,
at
the
same
time,
i
guess
according
to
their
theory,
we're
making
out
--
we're
disproving
our
own
case.
we
have
to
show
it's
spoiled
or
at
least
we
have
to
show
that
it
arrived
in
a
worsened
condition
and
it
was
at
the
time
we
delivered
it
to
the
carrier.
so
we
must
automatically
be
proven
that
it
was
unaccepted
cause.
the
--
the
argument
to
me
is
--
is
ridiculous.
but
if
you
--
you
can
carry
a
little
further
and
--
and
see
how
absurd
it
might
become.
for
example,
in
the
--
in
the
brief
--
in
their
brief,
reply
brief,
they
say
that
once
the
jury
finds
that
a
carrier
is
free
from
negligence,
then
you
have
shown
inherent
vice.
and
the
issue
should
never
have
even
been
submitted
to
the
court.
well,
now,
i
don't
understand
which
--
which
they're
doing
when
it
--
when
we
show
it
around
as
spoiled,
does
that
--
does
that
mean
it's
inherent
vice?
or
when
they
show
it
freedom
from
negligence,
does
that
mean
it's
inherent
vice?
put
it
another
way,
if
the
railroad
were
negligent
and
they
come
in
and
say,
"yes,
we
are
negligent."
then
is
this
spoilage
which
in
one
case
they
say
is
inherent
vice
becomes
something
else.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
the
court
improperly
instructed
the
jury
that
inherent
vice
are
included.
in
--
it
--
it
would
cover
natural
deterioration,
justice
white.
that
was
the
--
the
wrong
part
of
it.
the
rest
of
the
instruction
was
proper
and
it
wasn't
really
improper
or
misleading
to
include
that
but
it
was
too
in
--
too
all
inclusive
and
--
and
that
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
yes,
sir.
in
fact,
they
--
they
--
it
--
it
would
be
in
my
favor
of
course
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
--
because
it
covered
natural
deterioration.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
well,
about
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
a
thousand
different
reasons,
acts
of
third
parties.
the
--
a
commodity
improper
ventilation,
i
mean
is
that
what
you're
going
into
all
of
these
reasons
that
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
sir?
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
well,
it
would
be
and
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
what
if
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
well,
that's
correct.
of
course,
i
--
i
say
that
--
what
--
what
if
they
were
called,
if
they
felt
it
was
caused
by
the
act
of
third
party.
and
also,
i
--
i
say
negligence
doesn't
have
any
--
any
bearing
at
all
in
this
case.
what
if
they
felt
like
the
damage
was
caused
by
some
fault
of
carrier
that
didn't
amount
to
negligence
or
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
no,
sir,
we
don't
have
any
evidence
but
there
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
we
don't
--
we
contend
that
we
don't
have
to
show
that.
all
--
all
we
have
to
show
is
a
delivery
in
good
and
arrival
in
bad
or
at
least
an
arrival
in
a
worsened
condition
than
it
was.
otherwise,
all
you've
got
is
a
warehouseman
liability
here.
if
you
take
the
first
statement
in
their
reply
brief,
since
the
carrier
has
shown
its
freedom
from
negligence
in
compliance
with
the
shipper's
instructions,
it
is
not
liable
for
the
spoilage
and
decay
of
the
melon.
that's
all
you
have
in
a
warehouseman
liability
except
in
a
warehouseman
liability,
a
plaintiff
would
have
a
better
chance
to
probably
prevail
because
at
least
he
could
may
--
maybe
be
around
his
warehouse,
whereas
here,
the
shipment
moved
to
some
other
place
and
suppose
it
doesn't
take
into
account
mistakes
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
--
honest
mistakes
in
the
record.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
after
--
that's
what
they
say
we
have
to
prove
against
them.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
well,
they
show
first
that
they
handled
it
in
accordance
with
shipper's
instructions
and
in
a
recently
prudent
manner
as
to
all
matter
is
not
covered
by
such
instructions
that
they
were
free
from
negligence,
yes,
sir.
then
they
say
that
in
order
to
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
sir?
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
yes,
sir,
that's
correct
and
that
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
well,
you
show
that
a
delivery
to
them
in
good
condition
and
an
out
turn
in
a
damaged
condition
and
i
think
most
under
your
uniform
warehouseman
act
you
can
rest.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
then
they
would
have
to
go
in.
then
the
warehousemen
would
have
to
come
forward
and
show
freedom
from
negligence.
i
--
i
don't
think
you
have
any
difference
basically
in
the
--
in
the
liability
that
you
have
here.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i
don't
--
that
the
shipper
doesn't?
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
are
there
any
cases
that
hold
in
a
perishable
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
well,
yes,
sir.
i
think
the
department
of
agriculture
case
would
be
one
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly.
you're
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
well,
the
judge
is
wrong.
the
--
the
cases
are
uniformly
in
my
favor.
now,
they
cite
for
example.
they
--
the
judge
cites
in
his
brief.
he
cites
two
cases
in
support
of
his
proposition
that
a
common
law,
the
rule
as
to
perishables
was
as
he
contends.
those
cases
are
the
itule
case.
now,
the
itule
case,
if
you
will
read
that
on
arizona
case
which
attained
prominence
only
because
some
alr
writer
haven't
picked
it
up,
you
can
find
a
hundred
state
court
cases
that
--
that
holds
other.
i
haven't
even
bother
to
cite
state
court
cases
in
my
--
in
my
brief.
but
in
the
itule
case,
the
court
knew
what
the
law
was
at
common
law,
they
expressly
stated.
at
common
law
that
the
carrier
was
liable
unless
it
proved
that
it
was
one
of
these
--
except
for
one
of
these
causes.
then
it
went
on
to
say,
"now,
this
is
a
thing
of
first
impression
to
us
and
we're
--
we're
here
for
the
first
time.
and
we
think
tomatoes
are
more
like
livestock
so
we're
going
to
use
the
livestock
rule
on
a
carload
of
tomatoes."
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
wrote
--
they
don't
have
the
reverse
side
of
bill
of
lading
in
evidence
in
that
case.
but
in
that
case,
if
--
if
the
judge
felt
--
the
court
felt
that
way
and
felt
it
wasn't
a
fair
rule,
all
the
lawyer
would
have
had
to
do
and
say,
"judge,
i
don't
care
how
fair
you
think
it
--
you
--
it
looks,
turn
the
bill
of
lading
over
and
read
the
section
here",
and
it
says
that
they
agree
to
be
liable
as
a
common
law
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
--
and
he
would've
lost
in
the
itule
case.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
the
one
that
i
just
quoted
that
said
that
they
partook
more
of
the
--
that
tomatoes
partook
more
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
that
was
the
united
states
versus
department
of
agriculture
that
was
decided
here.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
well,
that
was
a
case
of
eggs
that
the
united
states
supreme
court
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
they
--
they
did.
i
think
you've
got
a
completely
different
livestock
rule
which
we're
not
concerned
with
here.
and
you've
got
different
exceptions
that
come
under
the
livestock
rule.
and
if
you
read
the
livestock
bill
of
lading
which
is
permitted
by
the
icc,
why
you've
got
the
word
"negligence"
referred
to
throughout
the
--
the
livestock
bill
of
lading
and
you
never
want
--
and
--
and
common
law
is
never
mentioned
in
the
livestock
bill
of
lading.
whereas
here,
it
says,
the
carrier
shall
be
liable
as
at
common
law.
getting
--
getting
back
to
these
errors,
the
--
the
whole
question
presented
in
this
case
was
stated
in
the
first
paragraph
of
the
supreme
court
of
texas'
opinion.
now,
the
aar
has
conceded
more
or
less.
they've
adopted
secondarily
the
argument
of
--
of
the
missouri
pacific
but
primarily,
the
--
the
first
time
that
the
argument
has
ever
been
raised
that
by
just
showing
a
--
an
arrival
in
a
damaged
condition
that
that
ipso
facto
is
spoilage,
has
been
raised
in
this
court
now.
we've
never
had
any
of
that
throughout
the
state
court.
they've
contended
that
their
freedom
from
negligence
was
a
complete
exoneration.
and
we
have
contended
that
they
must
first
prove
that
the
damage
was
due
to
an
accepted
cause
and
like
it
stated
in
the
norton
case.
now,
bear
in
mind
too
that
--
that
the
court
here
is
--
involved
the
shipment
of
honeydew
melons.
but
what
this
decision
amounts
to
is
how
--
not
only
shippers
of
fruits
and
vegetables
but
the
--
the
list
of
commodities
that
are
now
classified
as
perishables
as
inconceivable.
it
started
out
with
the
list
way
back
there
of
50
commodities
in
which
list,
they
included
the
fruits
and
vegetables.
they
listed
bananas
and
so
forth.
today,
it
includes
over
150
whereas
all
fruits
and
vegetables
are
not
of
such
as
that,
are
just
simply
in
one
category.
kale,
walnuts
and
things
like
that
are
perishables.
and
that
--
that's
the
rule
that
we're
going
to
have
live
by
that
this
court
will
--
will
have
to
decide.
where
in
their
argument,
is
there
any
room
for
fault
of
shipper
or
any
--
any
of
those
other
--
other
defects?
in
other
words,
why
isn't
all
--
why
aren't
all
of
the
terms
of
the
bill
of
lading
surplage?
why
do
they
say
that
the
carrier
shall
be
liable
as
at
common
law
except
this
follows
that
they
--
in
case
of
inherent
vice,
fault
of
shipper
and
so
forth?
why
not
just
say
that
unless
negligent
and
--
and
you
could
go
ahead
and
--
and
comply
fully
with
him
and
the
burden
of
proof
and
freedom
from
negligence
is
on
the
carrier,
the
carrier
is
not
liable.
there
--
there
is
no
difference.
you
--
you
rule
out
all
your
exceptions.
you
make
them
meaningless.
and
the
--
the
--
some
of
the
confusion
that
results,
i
think
in
his
argument
that
he
says
that
it's
--
that
all
--
all
commodities
will
decay,
and
that's
also
said
in
the
itule
case.
that's
not
a
true
statement.
you
can
take
a
--
a
honeydew
melon
or
anything
else.
it's
not
going
to
decay
unless
it
has
bacteria
and
an
opening
for
the
bacteria
to
enter.
and
even
then,
proper
humidity
and
temperature
and
so
forth
will
retort
it.
but
if
you
don't
have
those
factors,
it's
not
going
to
automatically
decay.
the
use
of
the
term
"decay"
in
this
case
con
--
confuses
this,
just
one
of
--
of
a
number
of
different
causes
of
damages
that
can
occur
to
various
commodities.
i
still
do
not
know
whether
they
admit
liability
before
this
court
for
bruising.
they
admitted
it
for
bruising
up
in
--
in
the
lower
court
and
yet
that
--
that
position
is
not
proper.
they
should
admit
it
if
it
occurred
in
transit,
they
should
be
liable.
if
it
occurred
before
transit,
they
should
not
be
liable.
they
confuse
natural
deterioration
with
inherent
vice
and
then
refused
it
in
his
own
--
in
his
own
statement
when
he
says
there
that
--
that
fruit
and
vegetables
die
from
the
moment
that
you
harvest
them.
that's
not
true.
and
as
he
says
--
he
says
it
on
the
next
page,
he
says
that,
"as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
lot
of
these
are
peak
--
picked
before
the
peak."
and
the
only
--
only
thing
--
only
good
that
a
honeydew
melon
or
any
other
fruit
and
vegetable
is,
is
to
eat.
and
when
you
pick
these
honeydew
melons
or
when
you
pick
in
--
and
pack
tomatoes,
we
were
talking
about
them,
at
the
--
at
the
time
they're
not
edible.
they're
picked
matured
green
and
in
case
of
honeydew
melons,
why
they're
mature
but
then
they're
gassed
and
then
they
ripen
up
to
market.
it
is
just
like
you
go
in
and
you
buy
tomato
that's
not
quite
ripe
in
the
market,
you
leave
it
at
home
for
two
or
three
day
before
you
consume
it.
and
it's
the
same
thing
here.
actually,
they
don't
--
they
continue
to
live.
and
if
a
commodity
--
if
--
if
somebody
were
foolish
enough,
if
some
shipper
were
foolish
enough
to
ship
a
carload
of
red
ripe
tomatoes
and
they
got
to
appear
and
they
were
completely
spoiled
and
overripe,
the
railroad
would
have
the
burden
of
showing
the
cause
of
the
damage
but
it
would
not
be
an
inherent
vice,
it's
natural
deterioration.
then
after
they
reach
that
peak
that
they're
going
to
be
used
for,
then
they
began
a
period
of
natural
deterioration.
they
only
have
so
much
life,
that's
true
of
any
perishable.
and
they
--
they
list
kale
as
a
--
as
a
perishable.
well
then,
i
guess
that's
--
that's
true
of
it.
but
still,
under
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
the
--
the
bill
of
lading
has
a
specific
exception
for
natural
deterioration.
it
doesn't
treat
it,
there
the
same.
it
says
that
carrier
shall
not
be
liable
for
natural
deterioration
or
for
a
vice
or
defect
in
the
property.
and
it
also
has
an
exception
for
faults
of
shipper.
they're
treated
separately
and
they
are
separately.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
no,
sir,
abs
--
absolutely
not.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
that's
correct.
you
take
another
example,
take
a
car
of
onions,
say
in
--
in
midsummer,
90
degree
or
100
degree
temperature
in
texas.
we
--
we
load
them
in
a
--
in
a
refrigerator
car,
say
we
ship
them
to
new
york
and
we
order,
i
said
this,
i
think,
example
in
my
brief,
we
order
the
bins
closed
on
it.
when
they
get
up
there
they're
going
to
--
you
--
you
better
stand
back
from
the
door
when
you
open
them.
and
they're
going
to
be
completely
wrong.
now
--
now,
they're
not
going
to
be
necessarily
decaying,
in
fact,
i
doubt
if
they
would
be
decayed.
they'd
be
really
melted.
but
they'd
be
worthless.
now,
it's
not
an
inherent
vice,
that's
not
natural
deterioration,
the
cause
of
that
damage
was
fault
of
shipper
in
improperly
ordering
the
service
of
that
car.
but
the
burden
of
proof
in
fault
of
shipper,
we
contend,
would
be
upon
the
railroad.
otherwise,
you
--
you
just
destroy
the
terms
of
your
bill
of
lading,
you
destroy
your
--
your
meaning
of
your
carmack
amendment.
and
i
--
and
i
say
the
consistent
case
of
that
is
the
whitnack
case.
for
example,
the
leading
case,
the
one
case
against
me
in
this
case
is
the
larry's
sandwiches
company
case.
that's
that
frozen
food
case.
then
--
then
they
cite
that
and
they
say,
"that's
it,
that's
the
law,
that's
our
baby."
now,
we
come
along
on
the
very
next
page
and
they
say,
"but
the
cases
cited
by
the
respondent
aren't
important
because
they're
not
cases
that
involved
natural
deterioration."
and
he
says
for
example,
whitnack
produce
case,
"that
involved
the
shipment
of
apples
which
thaw
in
trans
--
i
mean
which
froze
in
transit.
so,
he's
--
he's
asking
you
to
apply
a
rule
for
a
shipment
of
frozen
commodity
that
thaws
out
but
don't
--
but
says
that
a
commodity
that
shouldn't
be
frozen
--
that
freezes
doesn't
apply
at
all.
he
confuses
among
other
things
in
his
brief,
quality
and
condition.
he
--
he
seems
to
--
to
--
the
railroad
seems
to
be
using
the
term
"bruising"
as
a
quality
factor.
bruising
isn't
a
quality
factor,
bruising
is
a
--
is
a
condition
factor.
quality
never
changes
--
condition
changes
and
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
no
sir.
the
only
one
that
challenged
it
at
the
--
at
the
very
beginning
there
on
their
application
for
writ
of
certiorari,
they
didn't
--
the
--
the
railroad
attorney
obviously
didn't
understand
their
special
issue
of
practice
which
is
somewhat
confusing.
and
it's
--
it's
calculated
to
--
so
that
the
jury
doesn't
hold
the
effect
of
their
answer
but
if
they
frame
it,
so
they
don't
--
well
then
they
usually
end
up
as
the
lawyers
don't
know
the
effect
either.
and
in
--
in
the
--
they
did
say
that
the
--
the
issue
on
inherent
vice
was
not
a
finding
that
the
damage
was
not
due
to
inherent
vice.
and
they
raised
that
again
in
their
petitioner's
brief
and
then
we
pointed
out
wherein
they
erred
that
it
was.
the
jury
did
find
that
the
damage
in
this
case
was
not
caused
by
inherent
vice.
and
they
didn't
raise
it
in
their
reply
brief
or
questioned
that
further.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
that's
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
yes,
sir.
abso
--
oh,
yes,
sir.
you
--
you
--
that
the
jury
so
found
that
the
railroad
was
not
negligent.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
i
think
that
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
i
think
that
that
is
without
question
and
that
that
--
that's
been
established
and
never
been
questioned
up
to
now
either
in
the
--
in
the
court.
that
was
the
whole
question.
whether
they
have
that
burden
is
the
question
in
the
case.
now,
what
if
in
this
case,
if
the
damage
was
caused
by
a
bruising
in
transit?
what
if
it
was
caused
by
act
of
third
party?
what
if
it's
caused
by
something
the
--
the
discoloration
in
this
case,
we
don't
know
what
caused
it.
now,
the
decision
is
going
to
mean
wherein
a
case
of
an
unexplained
loss,
who
bears
the
burden?
is
whether
we
have
to
bear
the
burden
or
if
the
railroad
made
in
this
--
mistake
in
their
record,
the
jury
could
very
likely
find
and
would
find
that
i've
seen
a
hundred
cars
where
--
where
one
car
arrives
at
destina
--
at
a
--
at
an
intermediate
point,
they
make
a
record
of
events,
the
delivering
carrier,
then
the
carrier
that
picks
it
up
makes
another
record.
now,
i've
seen
--
there's
no
manipulation
of
events.
now,
i've
seen
those
two
records
changed,
are
different.
now,
one
of
them
is
in
error.
well,
always
on
that
situation,
they
go
back
and
they
find
out
which
is
in
accordance
with
the
shipper's
instructions
and
they
correct
that
--
that
one
because
we
know
one
of
them
is
wrong.
they
can't
both
be.
they
can't
be
opened
and
closed
at
the
same
time.
they
correct
that
one.
now,
that's
a
fair
rule
as
between
the
carriers.
there's
no
reason
to
presume
negligence
where
you
got
one
that
says
they
were
open
and
one
says
they're
closed,
why
presume
that
he
was
necessarily
negligent?
but
it
works
manifestly,
it's
unfair
to
the
shipper.
you
have
all
of
these
other
reasons
that
--
the
--
this
rule
is
--
is
a
far,
far
step
from
--
from
anything
that's
ever
been
advocated
before
and
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
i
say
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
i
say,
i
don't
have
to.
all
i
have
to
show
is
that
it
would
--
delivery
in
good
and
the
arrival
in
bad
are
arrival
in
the
worsened
condition.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
that
--
not
by
proving
freedom
from
negligence.
now,
by
saying
that
not
its
fault,
you
might
be
saying
that
it
did
not
cause
the
damage.
now,
that
would
imply
that
it
found
out
what
caused
the
damage
and
that's
what
they
have
to
do.
they
have
to
tell
us
what
caused
the
damage.
but
just
to
come
in
and
say,
our
records
are
clear,
they'd
come
in
texas
and
file
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
say
our
records
are
clear
and
we
can't
get
up
on
the
--
and
swear
that
their
records
in
our
opinion,
they
were
closed
at
st.
louis
or
something,
it
would
so
speculative
that
we
would
be
kicked
out
of
court
in
--
on
every
case,
on
a
--
on
a
summary
judgment
or
in
the
majority
of
cases.
it
--
it
would
--
it
would
result
in
a
gross
enactment.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
how
could
the
railroad
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
the
railroad?
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
they
could
have
shown
that
the
--
they
--
now,
they're
trying
to
--
when
you
read
the
record,
well,
you
will
see
that
they
made
every
effort
to
but
the
jury
didn't
believe
them.
they
--
they
tried
to
show.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
they
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
that's
correct.
they
couldn't
find
it.
they
--
well,
they
--
they
found
affirmatively.
i
don't
question
that.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
they
found
that
they
were
not
negligent.
how
they
did?
i
don't
know.
you
don't
have
a
fund
record
in
the
case.
they're
supposed
to
keep
the
funds
on.
you
don't
have
a
final
record
one
and
yet
everybody
admits
that
they
ought
to
be
on.
the
absence
of
records,
who
pays
for
it?
the
shipper,
not
the
railroad
and
that's
in
this
very
case.
we
do
not
have
a
final
record
here,
yet
the
man
who
was
testifying
about
it
was
the
one
that
made
up
and
says
that
the
funds
ought
to
be
owned
and
he
was
on
the
--
the
committee,
tariff
committee
and
everything
and
then
they
asked
him,
"why
didn't
they
have
a
record?"
he
says,
"we
didn't
like
a
rule
that
required
us
to
keep
one."
they
were
very
smart
about
that
but
they
didn't
keep
one
whether
it's
required
or
not.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
it
--
it
has
to
prove
your
reversal.
it
would
be
its
--
it
matters
not
how
they
handle
the
car
until
they
first
prove
that
the
cause
of
the
damage
was
due
to
one
of
the
accepted
causes.
those
accepted
causes
are
act
of
god
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
no,
no
effort
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
--
to
prove
act
of
god.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
they
did
try
to
prove
inherent
vice.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
they
tried
to
prove
that
the
cause
of
the
dark
discoloration
at
destination
was
due
to
dark
--
was
due
to
immaturity.
and
the
evidence
was
completely
against
them
on
it
and
the
jury
found
it
was
not.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that
--
that's
my
contention,
actually
if
you
wanted
to
get
into
a
technical
theory
of
the
thing,
when
they
show
for
example,
that
the
sole
cause
is
a
(inaudible)
and
so
forth.
they
--
they
doesn't
have
a
minute
to
show
that
a
part
of
it
unless
they
show
what
part.
but
if
you
get
into
the
point
there,
if
they
show
that
the
sole
cause
was
due
to
an
inherent
vice,
why,
then
you
might
say
that
they,
in
effect,
have
excluded
the
possibility
of
negligence
on
their
part.
but
--
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
--
to
keep
it
simple,
i
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
sir?
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
well,
they
--
it
should've
been
submitted
with
a
tag
as
we
say.
it
should've
been
submitted
the
--
they
submitted
the
inherent
vice
in
fault
of
shipper
and
then
i
say
the
court
should
have
submitted,
if
you
have
answered
the
preceding
questions,
no,
that
it
was
not
due
to
those.
you
need
not
answer
the
following
issue
otherwise,
your
answer
is
the
same
and
then
they
could
have
gone
into
their
negligence
issues.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
safe
assumption
except
the
judges
have
had
no
rule
to
go
by.
they
don't
know
what
theory
they're
trying
to
know.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
north,
jr.
yes,
sir.
(inaudible)
thank
you.
