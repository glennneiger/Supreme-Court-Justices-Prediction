you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
must
decide
the
case
then
on
the
basis
that
the
railroad
was
not
negligent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
accept
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
that
unless,
even
though
the
railroad
is
liable
unless
it's
proven
that
the
injury
was
due
to
an
act
of
god,
the
public
enemy
or
the
fault
of
the
shipper
or
the
inherent
nature
of
the
goods
themselves.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
had
failed
to
prove
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
--
you
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
against
the
railroad
of
negligence
by
simply
showing
the
injury.
and
you
say
that
even
though
the
--
the
railroad
is
negligent,
nevertheless,
it's
liable
unless
these
conditions
caused
the
injury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
its
more
than
a
prima
facie
case.
you
make
more
than
a
prima
facie
case,
do
you
not,
under
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
makes
out
a
prima
facie
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
railroad
cannot
exempt
itself
by
proving
it
was
not
its
fault.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
case,
under
that
principle
of
law,
how
could
they
prove
nonliability?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
method
--
what
--
what
instances
would
release
them
in
your
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
believe
they
were
not
negligent,
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
