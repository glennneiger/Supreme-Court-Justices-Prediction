mr.
thurman
arnold
mr.
chief
justice,
--
mr.
thurman
arnold
--
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
is
--
presents
a
very
simple
and
clear-cut
issue
to
this
court.
it
involves
the
liability
of
a
railroad
for
damages
for
spoilage
of
fruit
in
a
case
where
it
has
carried
out
its
burden
of
proof.
and
the
jury
has
specifically
found
that
it
is
without
negligence
and
it's
carried
on
all
its
obligations
without
fault.
our
position
is
that
under
the
federal
common
law,
as
applied
by
the
carmack
amendment,
the
obligation
of
the
railroad
is
solely
to
assume
the
burden
of
proof
of
showing
that
there
were
--
was
no
negligence.
in
the
early
days,
as
the
court
probably
knows,
the
only
exemption
from
liability
to
your
--
to
your
hand
was
act
of
god
or
the
public
enemy.
but
as
time
developed
and
transportation
increased,
it
--
it's
came
to
include,
add
to
the
government,
add
to
the
shipper
an
inherent
vice
in
the
goods.
and
there,
developed
an
exception
when
cattle
were
shipped
and
would
tend
as
--
to
injure
each
other
and
all
the
railroad
had
to
prove
was
due
care
and
lack
of
negligence.
and
later
as
the
shipment
of
fruits
became
a
tremendous
enterprise
going
over
long
distance,
the
--
the
cattle
exception
was
extended
to
perishable
fruits
and
vegetables.
and
i
think
it
had
to
be
because
if
the
inherent
vice
means
anything,
then
it
--
the
tendency
of
vegetables
to
decay
is
an
inherent
vice.
second
place,
we
assert
that
we're
exonerated
from
liability
on
proof
of
freedom
from
fault
by
the
terms
of
the
bill
of
lading
itself,
which
exempts
the
carrier
from
liability
if
the
damage
is
caused
by
inherent
vice
in
the
goods.
in
the
third
place,
we
are
exempt
from
liability
by
the
protective
tariff
services.
it
is
provided
that
the
shipper
may
pay
for
what
is
called
"protective
services".
and
in
the
regulations
covering
those
services,
the
liability
of
the
carrier
specifically
brought
out
and
it
includes
only
liability
where
he
has
caused
the
damage
and
where
there
is
some
fault.
now,
the
respondent
takes
the
position
that
inherent
vice
means
some
peculiar
defect
in
vegetables
which
are
not
present
in
ordinary
vegetables.
it
means
that
the
mere
tendency
to
decay
is
not
an
inherent
vice
in
the
goods
and
that
the
carrier
therefore
must
prove
more
than
freedom
from
negligence.
he
must
pursue
--
prove
precisely
what
did
cause
the
decay.
and
of
course,
that
means
he
is
liable
as
the
insurer.
we
assert
in
our
brief
and
we
reexamine
the
cases
that
all
of
the
cases
are
against
to
be
--
the
position
of
the
respondent
with
respect
to
their
argument.
the
cases
which
he
cites
in
his
favor
are
it
is
true
fruits
and
vegetable
cases
but
they're
not
cases
of
decay.
they
are
cases
of
spoilage
and
completely
irrelevant
here.
and
finally,
the
respondent
--
mr.
thurman
arnold
i
--
i
made
--
i
make
--
i
do
not
use
the
words
separate.
i
mean
i
used
--
i
mean
the
same
thing,
by
spoilage
and
decay.
mr.
thurman
arnold
oh,
no,
it's
--
this
case
are
--
not
cases
of
spoilage
or
decay.
they're
cases
of
breakage.
mr.
thurman
arnold
and
--
mr.
thurman
arnold
no.
in
the
case
of
breakage,
i
think
the
carrier
would
--
would
not
have
an
exemption
because
that
is
not
an
inherent
vice
in
the
goods
themselves.
finally,
the
last
argument
of
the
respondent
is
based
on
public
policy
which
we
do
not
comprehend
at
all.
certainly,
liability
without
fault
has
never
been
proved
by
the
law.
and
i
cannot
in
--
i
think
it's
--
the
public
policy
argument
amounts
to
no
more
or
less
than
an
assertion.
and
i
don't
think
it
is
backed
by
any
reasoning.
thank
you.
mr.
thurman
arnold
no.
well,
i
--
i
think
it
maybe
what
i
mean
but
let
me
restate
it.
it
is
--
when
the
goods
arrived
in
a
deteriorated
state,
after
they
had
been
put
on
in
a
good
state,
there
is
only
one
reason
--
only
two
possible
reasons
for
the
deterioration.
one
is
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
carrier
and
third
is
the
inherent
tendency
of
the
vegetable
to
decay.
and
our
position
is
that
when
you
eliminate
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
carrier,
the
words
"inherent
vice"
found
in
the
bill
of
lading,
found
in
the
common
law,
mean
not
peculiar
defects
but
the
general
tendency
for
the
vegetables'
decay.
mr.
thurman
arnold
i
think
i
should
be
very
brief.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
whole
thing,
if
the
case
can
be
summed
down
--
down
in
a
couple
of
sentences.
if
fruit
arrived
in
a
spoiled
condition,
the
car
--
the
carrier
must
show,
first,
that
it
was
negligent.
that
it
complied
with
all
of
the
required
services.
third
--
second,
they
faithfully
complied
with
the
shipper's
instructions.
and
having
done
that,
i
think
the
case
is
--
are
conclusive
on
our
way.
the
secretary
of
agriculture
case
does
not
hold,
as
counsel
seems
to
think.
that
was
the
case
where
regulations
of
the
secretary
allowing
a
certain
percentage
of
breakage
in
eggs
exempted
the
carrier
over
a
certain
percentage
of
breakings
in
eggs
was
overturned
by
this
court
on
the
ground
that
it
was
an
attempt
to
evade
the
common
law
liability
which
the
secretary
of
agriculture
did
not
have
the
right
to
do
under
the
carmack
amendment.
and
then
in
my
final
observation
is
that
there
is
no
separate
exception
in
the
bill
of
lading
for
natural
deterioration,
as
counsel
seems
to
think.
you
found
the
phrase
natural
deterioration
in
the
protective
services
regulations
and
those
regulations
exempt
the
carriers
for
one
natural
deterioration.
now,
finally,
i
call
your
attention
to
--
the
court,
to
the
footnote
on
page
5
of
our
reply
brief
which
then
--
which
starts
out
as
follows.
both
the
texas
supreme
court
and
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals
viewed
the
case
as
whether
the
claims
for
spoilage
and
decay
as
to
which
the
only
issue
was
the
proper
legal
rule
to
be
applied.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
that
because
counsel
seemed
that
the
points
in
his
argument
to
be
indicating
there
were
some
questions
of
facts.
mr.
thurman
arnold
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thurman
arnold
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thurman
arnold
well,
we
--
we
have
three
arguments.
first,
the
carmack
amendment
applied
to
common
law
and
this
is
a
common
law.
second,
the
bill
of
lading
applies
to
common
law
rule
and
this
is
a
common
law.
and
third,
the
protective
services
also
apply
the
same
rule
and
the
potential
issues
therefore
is
--
is
the
common
law
requirements
complied
with?
mr.
thurman
arnold
oh,
no,
i've
--
i
--
we
assert
that
there
is
no
case
against
us.
the
secretary
of
agriculture
case
believes
that's
not
against
--
there
are
no
state
courts
against
us.
mr.
thurman
arnold
oh,
yes.
i
mean
(voice
overlap)
to
repeat.
mr.
thurman
arnold
yes
sir.
mr.
thurman
arnold
well,
i
suppose
it
could
be.
i
suppose
it
could
be
--
i
think
it
shouldn't
be
reversed
on
all
three.
i
was
--
because
the
fundamental
issue
is
what
is
a
common
law?
mr.
thurman
arnold
no,
the
instruction
--
mr.
thurman
arnold
no,
no.
the
jury
was
instruct
to
find
the
railroad
if
they
found
--
the
jury
was
instructed
to
find
for
the
railroad
if
they
found
there
was
no
negligence.
now,
there
is
some
inconsistent,
apparently
inconsistent
findings
here.
if
you
turn
to
the
record
on
page
180,
the
bottom,
special
issue
number
6,
do
you
find
from
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
worsened
condition
if
any
of
the
honeydew
melons
in
the
car
at
the
time
of
the
delivery
of
boston
was
solely
due
to
an
inherent
vice,
as
that
term
was
here
in
the
finding
existing,
it's
a
time
the
melons
were
received
by
the
carrier
at
the
rio
grande.
now,
there
are
several
findings
like
that.
and
the
jury
answered
no
to
all
of
them.
and
counsel
was
quite
honest
in
his
admission
that
those
are
not
affirmative
findings
at
all.
under
the
texas
rule
which
we
set
out
on
page
--
footnote
--
page
5
and
6
of
our
brief,
we
give
the
cases
supporting
the
admission
of
both
counsels,
that
those
are
not
affirmative
findings.
so
there
is
no
instances
and
findings
in
this
case
under
the
texas
rule.
