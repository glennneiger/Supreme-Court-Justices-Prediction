well,
may
i
ask
you
(inaudible)
mr.
justice
black's
question,
as
i
understand
your
position
is,
you
make
the
case
for
liability,
merely
on
proof
of
loading
in
good
shape,
arriving
in
poor
shape.
the
railroad
then
has
to
prove
two
things.
it
has
to
prove
absence
of
negligence
but
that
doesn't
let
it
out
unless
it
also
proves
what?
what's
the
other
thing
it
has
to
prove?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
though
they
made
no
effort
to
prove
act
of
god
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
other
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
after
proving,
they
--
they
have
first
approved
they
come,
as
i
understand
you,
within
one
of
the
exceptions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
after
establishing,
they
come
in
within
one
of
the
exceptions
since
they
also
have
to
prove
no
negligence,
is
that
it?
