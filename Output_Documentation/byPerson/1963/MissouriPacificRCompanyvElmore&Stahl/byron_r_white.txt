did

(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
do
you
think
that
area
--
do
you
think
the
jury
answered
the
questions
correctly
though,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
the
reasons
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
the
reasons
are
there
besides
the
negligence
of
the
carrier
or
inherent
vice
to
--
to
result
in
this
worsened
condition?
justice
byron
r.
white
other
than
the
fact
that
they
were
just
perishable
commodity?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
have
--
you
would
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
have
to
prove
negligence
against
the
warehouseman,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
do
--
don't
they
have
to
prove
no
negligence?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
your
case
is
made
out
just
when
you
show
that
they
arrived
in
bad
condition?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
--
and
they
left
in
good
condition
and
you
can
--
you
can
rest
right
there,
can't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
true
of
the
warehouseman,
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
could
they
--
they
have
to
show
their
freedom
from
negligence,
the
warehousemen?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
--
that
is
correct
and
that
--
this
is
not
new
law.
this
is
--
what
they're
doing,
it
sounds
new
because
they're
asking
such
a
tremendous
jump
in
carrier
law.
this
has
always
been
the
law.
the
department
of
agriculture
case,
this
court
held
is
to
be
the
law.
and
in
its
footnote
there,
it
says,
"after
we
establish
a
prima
facie
case,
then
the
burden
is
upon
the
carrier
to
show
that
the
cause
was
one
for
which
the
law
accepts
it."
and
actually,
we've
got
--
if
you
want
to
really
get
down
to
the
real
question
here
in
a
nutshell,
it
--
it's
who
is
liable
for
unexplained
loss.
it
--
it's
a
fair
rule
of
course
to
--
to
have
the
railroad
liable
for
unexplained
loss.
and
to
start
out
with
this
business
of
saying,
"we
prove
a
prima
facie
case
by
showing
delivery
in
good
and
arrival
in
bad."
we
say
that
to
quick.
it's
a
--
it's
a
very
difficult
task.
i've
been
trying
this
for
20
years.
i've
represented
the
missouri
pacific
in
a
lot
of
the
cases
years
ago
but
it's
a
hard
proposition
to
prove
a
delivery
in
good
condition
of
the
exact
condition
of
the
commodity.
the
railroad
has
the
advantage
of
--
take
for
example
honey
--
honeydew
melon,
for
you
to
get
200
feet
in
the
air
around
rio
grand
city
and
probably
to
see
every
inch
of
ground
that
every
honeydew
melon
in
texas
is
grown
on.
and
the
railroad
has
records
of
every
court.
now,
i
mention
that
we
sustain
that
burden
and
they
have
the
right
to
cross-examine
and
they
have
the
right
to
compare
the
cars,
they
have
their
experts
down
there
on
hand,
they
have
their
agents
who
issue
a
clean
bill
of
lading.
and
incidentally,
these
honeydew
melons,
you
see
every
melon
in
the
crate,
alright
they
take
it
over
then
they
move
it
up
there.
now,
what
do
we
have
in
--
in
the
--
in
--
suppose
an
honest
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
carrier
--
we
--
we
pay
for
an
honest
mistake
that
the
carrier
makes.
in
every
case,
the
one
that
reports,
not
in
every
case
but
in
most
cases,
the
one
that
reports
position
of
events
and
so
forth
is
the
man
who
manipulates
the
particular
events.
if
he
doesn't
see
fit
to
admit
his
error,
who
pays
for
it?
the
railroad?
no,
the
shipper,
under
their
theory
of
the
law.
it's
--
it's
inconceivable.
and
again,
you
have
all
numerous
instances.
for
example,
they
cite
in
there
their
principles
and
practices
and
this
--
this
set
of
rules
that
they
have
among
themselves
for
the
adjustment
of
claims
which
parts
of
them
are
--
aren't
--
are
not
based
on
legal
liability.
i
don't
even
think
that
they
contend
it
but
they
say
we're
happy
with
them.
we're
not
happy
with
them.
we're
not
happy
at
all
with
them.
justice
byron

white
do
you
--
are
there
any
cases
you
know
of
that
squarely
hold
that
you
don't
need
to
prove
negligence
in
the
perishable
commodity
situation?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
--
yes,
do
you
have
--
do
you
assert
--
is
there
--
in
--
in
perishable
commodity
cases,
is
there
any
requirement
beyond
negligence
imposed
by
any
cases
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
put
a
higher
burden
and
just
negligence
that
--
that
no
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
carrier?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
judge
said
the
cases
were
uniformly
against
you,
isn't
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
case
is
it
that
you
say
you
have
it
in
a
--
in
a
court
which
--
which
would've
held
those
tomatoes
not
to
be
like
livestock?
i'm
not
sure
if
the
case
that
you
have
in
mind
didn't
deal
with
tomatoes
but
i
suppose
it
would've
held
according
to
you
that
tomatoes
weren't
livestock.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
that
the
case
on
your
side,
the
agricultural
case,
what
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
that
court
wouldn't
have
--
wouldn't
have
held
tomatoes
to
be
like
livestock
but
the
tomatoes
were
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that
--
does
that
court,
the
supreme
court
decided
that
case
would've
said
that
tomatoes
are
not
like
livestock
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
judge,
do
you
--
do
you
think
that
the
protective
service
regulation
states
the
applicable
rule
of
law
to
be
followed
in
cases
like
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
the
state
courts
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
state
courts
have
to
follow
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
your
position
--
does
the
state
--
if
the
state
courts
apply
a
rule
different
in
the
protective
service
regulation
that
the
case
is
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
take
that,
well,
this
one
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
this
one
--
this
one,
i
take
it,
refuses
to
follow
the
--
the
protective
service
regulation.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
could
the
case
be
reversed
solely
on
that
basis?
that
--
that
it
refused
to
follow
the
--
the
regulation?
