even
excluding
--
even
putting
all
that
one
side,
wasn't
there
still
overwhelming
evidence
of
guilt?
justice
potter
stewart
putting
aside
not
only
the
introduction
of
this
unconstitutionally
gathered
evidence,
but
also
everything
that
float
from
it
wasn't
there
still
overwhelming
evidence
of
guilt.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
have,
first
of
all,
the
fact
that
these
swastikas
were
painted
on
the
synagogue.
then
you
have
the
fact
that
within
the
hour,
these
two
young
men
were
found
with
color
black
paint
and
a
paintbrush
in
their
car.
there
is
no
claim
that
was
an
unconstitutional
search
and
seizure,
did
they?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
you
have
the
fact
that
after
an
arrest
warrant
was
secured
later
in
the
next
morning,
tuesday
morning,
and
these,
the
officers
went
to
these
young
men
to
their
home.
they
freely
confessed,
and
it
says,
i
am
reading
now
from
the
court's
opinion,
when
the
police
later
in
the
morning
came
with
warrants
to
arrest
them,
they
admitted
their
guilt
at
once
and
attempted
to
excuse
their
conduct
as
a
crime.
now,
isn't
that
overwhelming
evidence
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
certainly
the
fact
that
swastikas
were
painted
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
corpus
delicti
if
you
will.
and
the
stopping
of
the
automobile
and
the
finding
or
the
observation
of
the
paint
and
the
paintbrushes
in
car
of
these
young
men
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
later
search
and
seizure.
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
other
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
you
are
telling
now
that
the
seized
evidence
wasn't
admitted
and
my
only
question
is
even
without
these
seized
evidence
and
without
everything
that
flowed
from
the
seized
evidence,
wasn't
there
still
overwhelming
evidence
of
guilt
and
particularly
the
admission
after
there
were
arrest
warrant,
the
admission,
the
immediate
admission
by
these
two
defendants
that
they
have
done
it
and
saying
only
that
it
was
a
prank.
justice
potter
stewart
the
evidence
wasn't
admitted
until
weeks
or
days
later
at
a
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
a
matter
of
the
courts
or
state
law,
but
in
addition
to
the
language
that
my
brother
goldberg
quoted
to
you,
the
court
said,
to
me
it's
the
significant,
they
say,
the
defendants
do
not
claim
nor
as
the
transcript
shows
could
they
claim
that
the
illegal
search
and
seizure
induced
their
admissions
or
confessions.
and
i
had
assumed
that
the
meaning
of
that
language
was
that
to
be
explained
on
these
later
language
on
page
23,
when
the
court
points
out
that
at
the
time
of
a
perfectly
valid
arrest,
when
the
police
came
there
armed
with
arrest
warrants,
these
defendants
immediately
admitted
that
they
have
done
the
act
in
question,
long
before
days
if
not
weeks
or
months
before
any
illegal
evidence
was
introduced
in
any
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
my
only
question
is
whether
you
have
a
point
to
force?
justice
potter
stewart
i
certainly
understand
your
first
point,
which
is
there
can
be
no
harmless
error
that's
certainly
very
understandable.
i
had
assumed
that
you
had
conceded
that
this
was
harmless
error
and
i
wonder
if
it
isn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
we
have
it
--
we
have
it
right
here.
