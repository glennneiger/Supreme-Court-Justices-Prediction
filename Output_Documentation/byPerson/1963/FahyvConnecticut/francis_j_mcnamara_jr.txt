mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
errors
of
the
state
of
connecticut
to
review
a
judgment
of
that
court
affirming
the
conviction
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
harold
fahy,
of
the
offence
of
violating
section
53-45
of
the
general
statutes
of
connecticut
as
amended.
that
statute
provides
that
any
person
who
wilfully
injures
any
public
building
or
willfully
places
a
bomb
or
other
explosive
device
in
any
such
building
shall
be
fined
not
more
than
$5,000
or
a
prison
not
more
than
20
years
or
both.
i
might
say
at
the
outset
that
the
time
this
case
was
tried,
there
were
two
defendants,
mr.
fahy
and
arnold.
and
as
the
court
may
know,
mr.
arnold's
petition
was
dismissed
by
the
court
on
its
own
motion
before
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
the
fahy
case
was
granted.
the
facts
in
this
case,
if
the
court
please,
are
quite
simple
and
a
few.
on
february
1st
1960
at
4:30
in
the
morning,
an
officer
of
the
norwalk,
connecticut
police
department
was
conducting
a
routine
patrol
on
a
street
in
south
norwalk
on
which
there
was
situated
a
jewish
house
of
worship.
he
saw
at
that
time
four
swastikas
painted
in
black
paint
on
this
building.
at
the
same
time,
another
officer
of
the
same
department,
osborne
lindwall,
was
operating
a
patrol
car
a
short
distance
from
this
house
of
worship
and
between
that
place
and
the
home
of
the
defendant
harold
fahy.
officer
lindwall
noticing
that
the
vehicle
being
operated
by
fahy
was
operating
without
lights.
he
stopped
the
car
and
questions
both
of
the
boys,
mr.
fahy,
the
driver;
arnold,
the
passenger.
during
the
course
of
this
interrogation,
the
officer
also
made
a
check
of
the
automobile
and
he
noticed
on
the
floor,
under
the
seat,
a
can
or
jar
of
paint
and
a
brush.
he,
of
course,
at
that
time
did
not
know
the
discovery
that
had
been
made
officer
tigano
earlier
at
that
morning.
so
that
after
this
questioning
period
was
over,
he
released
the
two
boys
from
interrogation.
he
did
however
follow
the
automobile
to
the
home
of
the
defendant
fahy,
and
when
he
saw
that
they
were
in
the
house,
he
then
left
and
went
on
about
his
business.
sometime
after
that,
it
was
reported
to
him
that
this
episode
had
occurred
at
this
temple
in
south
norwalk.
it's
not
clear
in
the
record
how
it
was
reported
but
it
was.
he
then
put
two
into
together
and
returned
to
the
fahy
home
without
any
arrest
warrant,
without
a
search
warrant,
and
entered
the
garage
of
the
home,
which
was
situated
under
the
house,
opened
the
door,
went
in,
opened
the
door
of
the
automobile,
removed
the
paint
can
and
paintbrush
from
the
car,
and
brought
it
back
to
the
police
station.
within
a
few
hours
thereafter
six
or
eight
officers
of
the
norwalk
police
department
returned
to
the
fahy
home
with
warrants
for
the
arrest
of
these
two
boys
and
took
--
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
about
two
hours
mr.
justice
harlan.
returned
to
the
home
and
took
the
two
boys
in
custody
being
forced
to
actually
go
into
the
house
and
wake
the
boys
up
in
order
to
take
them
out
and
bring
them
back
to
the
police
station,
which
they
did.
this
case
which
resulted
in
the
judgment
which
is
now
before
the
court
came
to
trial
in
bridgeport,
connecticut,
the
superior
court,
without
a
jury
on
june
28th
1960,
approximately
one
year
before
this
court's
decision
in
mapp
against
ohio.
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
the
state
offered
in
evidence
the
paint
can
and
paintbrush,
which
had
been
removed
by
officer
lindwall
from
the
fahy
home
around
5:30
or
6
o'
clock
on
the
morning
of
february
1st.
defense
counsel's
attempt
to
explore
with
the
states
witness
lindwall,
the
circumstance
under
which
he
had
obtained
this
material
were
held
after
five
or
six
questions
by
an
objection
by
the
state
that
the
federal
exclusionary
rule
did
not
apply
in
the
state
court
proceeding.
on
appeal
to
the
connecticut
supreme
court
after
both
defendants
were
found
guilty
of
this
offence,
in
addition
to
raising
various
questions,
two
questions
actually,
one
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
convict
under
the
statute,
and
two
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
information
to
charge
an
offence.
we
also
raise
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
have
not
been
erroneously
precluded
from
going
into
this
search
and
seizure
during
the
trial
in
view
of
the
court's
decision,
this
court
decision
in
mapp
against
ohio,
which
had
been
decided
by
the
time
they
appealed
to
the
connecticut
supreme
court
had
been
perfected.
we
had
felt
upon
appeal
that
the
record
was
not
entirely
sufficient
with
the
questions
we
were
able
to
ask
in
lower
court
to
present
fully
the
search
and
seizure
question
before
the
supreme
court
of
errors.
so
that
in
effect
we
were
asking
for
either
a
new
trial
or
for
a
hearing
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
evidence
should
have
been
properly
admitted.
the
connecticut
supreme
court
took
the
view
that
after
dismissing
our,
the
two
points
i
previously
mentioned
concerning
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
the
statutory
construction,
took
the
position
that
the
record
in
the
case
was
sufficient
for
them
to
be
able
to
make
a
determination
that
the
search
and
seizure
by
officer
lindwall
was
unlawful
within
the
meaning
of
this
court's
opinion
in
mapp
against
ohio.
so
that
supreme
court
of
errors
did
affirmatively
decide
that
the
search
was
unlawful.
they,
then
however,
preceded
to
find
that
in
view
of
other
evidence
in
the
case,
the
seized
articles,
which
were
admitted
in
evidence
were
not
sufficiently
harmful
to
warrant
reversal,
in
effect,
decided
that
the
normal
rules
of
harmless
error
applied
and
that
the
conviction
could
be
affirmed
upon
the
other
evidence
in
the
record.
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
your
honor
there
were
--
yes,
there
were
admissions
made
by
both
defendants,
some
at
the
home
at
the
time
they
were
arrested
and
additionally
at
the
police
station.
the
defendant
arnold
executed
a,
what
should
be
termed
the
confession
at
the
police
station.
mr.
fahy
did
not,
but
did
make
certain
oral
statements
which
were
testified
too.
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
unfortunately
that
--
we
never
did
get
to
that
point
in
the
trial
court
and
the
connecticut
supreme
court
did
referred
to
the
fact
that
that
was
not
claimed,
but
of
course,
we
never
really
reached
that
point
in
the
trial
court.
we
--
my
questioning
in
this
whole
area
was
stopped
and
that
provided
the
basis
for
the
appellate
review.
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
we
were
arguing
that
without
the
lawfully
seized
evidence,
the
corpus
delicti
would
not
have
been
proven.
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
the
written
confession
of
the
defendant
arnold,
at
my
recollection
sir,
was
in
fact
received
an
evidence.
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
yes.
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
i
did
not
represent
mr.
arnold,
but
i
do
not
believe
it
was
objected
to
your
honors,
i
recall.
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
i
am,
just
really
to
be
perfectly
candid,
not
certain
whether
my
co-counsel
did
object
to
the
admission
to
that
confession
or
not.
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
it
is
in
the
record
i
believe,
the
transcript,
which
has
been
filed
with
the
record
of
the
case
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
after
the
--
there
were
your
honor.
after
the
state's
case
was
in,
it
became
abundantly
clear
that,
i
am
being
very
frank
about
this,
that
at
least
speaking
for
my
own
client
that
the
he
was
going
to
be
convicted
by
this
judge
unless
we
could
convince
the
court
that
the
element
of
willfulness
in
connection
with
intending
to
inflict
material
substantial
injury
on
this
building
was
not
in
the
case.
so
the
defendants
testified,
and
in
effect,
admitted
what
the
facts
clearly
show
that
they
had
done
this,
they
denied,
both
of
them
that
they
ever
had
any
willful
intent
to
inflict
injury
on
this
building,
and
--
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
that
was
--
that's
about
it.
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
drinking
in
this
situation.
i
believe
that
in
a
period
of
about
six
hours
before
this
episode
took
place
that
these
boys
had
drunk
tequila,
bourbon,
brandy,
and
one
another
item
which
escapes
me
and
that
was
--
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
none
of
the
pain,
no
sir
[laughter].
so
as
the
question
which
is
raised
here
is
the,
is
connecticut
supreme
court's
determination
that
the
normal
rules
of
the
harmless
error
apply
in
a
case
where
unconstitutional
evidence
has
been
used
at
the
trial
and
where
the
trial
has
been
infected
with
an
unconstitutional
procedure.
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
we
claim
that
the
can
and
brush,
which
were
admitted
by
the
trial
court
should
not
have
been
admitted,
that
we
should
have
been
permitted
the
trial
court
to
firmly
establish
that
it
had
been
unlawfully
admitted,
perhaps
although
i
have
to
be
very
candid
and
say
this
was
a
year
before
mapp
was
decided,
but
perhaps
we
might
have
gone
on
from
there
and
attempted
to
show
that
the
other
evidence
was,
the
admissions
so
forth,
were
further
a
poisonous
tree.
we
never
got
to
all
of
this.
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
yes.
my
basic
point
here
is
that
--
basically
what
it
comes
down
to
it,
first,
there
is
no
such
doctrine
as
harmless
error
where
there
has
been
an
unconstitutional
trial
procedure,
where
a
coerce
confession
has
been
admitted,
where
coerce
admissions
have
been
received,
where
unlawfully
seized
evidence
has
been
used,
that
the
normal
evidentiary
rules
of
trial
of
harmless
error
did
not
apply.
and
the
reason
for
that,
in
our
view,
should
be
that
if
the
reasons,
which
lay
behind
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
to
state
court
proceeding
is
to
have
any
validity.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
cannot
result
in
having
a
little
bit
of
unconstitutional
evidence
in
the
case.
that
there
is
no
such
thing
and
there
can
be
no
such
thing
under
the
rule
of
mapp
and
ker
as
a
little
bit
of
the
violation
of
due
process.
it's
like
having
a
little
bit
of
leprosy.
it
just
--
it
doesn't
fit.
if
there
is
--
it
is
true
that
these
defendants
did
do
this
deed
on
the
day
in
question,
but
it
seems
to
us
that
they
were
not
convicted
at
a
trial
that
was
free
from
error,
an
error
of
constitutional
dimension.
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
well,
the
decision
in
the
courts
of
appeals
throughout
the
country
on
this
point
appeared
it
was
to
be
in
conflict.
and
in
our
brief
we
have,
i
think,
cited
four
of
them.
i
think
one
was
from
new
york,
mccole
case,
one
was
from
district
of
columbia,
and
i
think
two
were,
if
my
recollection
is
correct,
from
california
ninth
circuit,
and
they
go
in
different
directions
on
this
point.
we
say
this
that
our
looking
at
these
cases
has
shown
us
however
that
it
does
seem
that
these
--
this
harmless
error
rule
had
just
been
applied
without
a
real
discussion
of
its
application
in
light
of
mapp
and
ker.
and
i
don't
believe
that
there
have
been
any
decisions
that
have
discussed
in
that
light.
the
second
point
is
this
in
our
view.
we
don't
think
that
the
court
need
to
go
any
further
with
this
case
than
to
decide
that
there
is
not
such
doctrine
as
harmless
error
where
you
are
talking
about
coerced
confession
and
unlawfully
seized
evidence
and
so
forth.
but
even
if
they
were,
we
don't
want
to
be
heard
to
say
by
putting
all
our
emphasis
on
this
first
point
that
we
agree
with
the
connecticut
supreme
court
of
errors
that
the
evidence
admitted
in
this
case
was
harmless.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
not.
in
the
light
of
the
evidence
abused
by
the
state
was
not
harmless.
actually,
just
to
give
a
couple
of
examples,
officer
lindwall
who
testified
at
the
trial
was
able
to
tie
this
evidence
in
with
the
evidence
he
had
seen
before
in
the
automobile,
officer
tigano
whom
i
previously
mentioned
testified
that
he
had
gone
out
to
the
building
after,
it
matched
the
paint
with
the
paint
in
the
can
that
he
had
matched
the
size
of
the
strokes
of
the
brush
with
the
brush
itself,
so
that
we
do
not
think
--
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
if
you
--
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
if
you
leave
out
also
mr.
justice
stewart
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
themselves,
then
i
say
the
answer
to
the
question
is
no.
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
no
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
you
can
say
--
i
guess
on
that
record
you
could,
but
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
we
were
never
--
for
example
on
another
trial,
we
would
now
explore
the
extent
to
which
all
of
the
facts,
which
your
honor
has
related,
were
induced
to
some
degree
by
the
a
lawfully
seized
evidence.
none
of
this
was
gone
into,
so
that
it's
impossible
to
tell
on
this
record.
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
well,
i
would
have
to
respectfully
disagree
only
with
the
last
that
lindwall
was
the
only
one
who
was
able
to
connect
these
items
up.
he
was
able
to
connect
the
seized
evidence
with
the
evidence
he
had
previously
seen
in
the
automobile.
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
the
other
two
points
–
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
if
that
--
if
the
admissions,
if
the
admissions
were
not
induced
by
the
unconstitutionally
seized
evidence
--
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
yes
but
by
that
time,
the
search
and
seizure
had
already
occurred.
and
if
the
record,
the
record
could
have
shown
if
we
have
been
able
to
go
in
with
the
trial,
we
could
have
shown
possibly
that
all
these
admissions.
and
i
think
the
admissions
are
important,
flowed
from
this
depravation
of
due
process
by
the
police
officers,
now
it's
impossible
to
tell
--
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
now,
i'm
glad
you
brought
that
back
to
my
attention
because
i
would
like
to
point
out
one
thing.
the
court
said,
they
do
not
claim.
now
my
recollection
of
the
argument
is
that
this
point
did
not
come
up.
i
think
what
the
connecticut
supreme
court
meant
in
that
opinion
was
that
they
do
not
claim
and
they
did
not
claim,
we
did
not
make
it
a
point
in
the
case,
and
i
would
have
to
conceive
now
that
we
did
not
claim
that
at
the
trial.
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
i
really
do
not
recall
your
honor,
i
just
don't
recall.
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
i
think
they
would,
i
think
they
would,
but
again
i
can't
say
that
for
sure,
because
the
time
this
case
went
up
on
appeal
mapp,
it
just
been
decided
and
my
recollection
is
we
actually
gave
very
brief
treatment
to
this
problem
in
the
supreme
court,
our
main
appeal,
our
main
argument
in
the
connecticut
supreme
court
was
that
while
these
defendants
had
committed
a
reprehensible
act,
that
they
had
--
their
actions
had
not
violated
this
statute
that
this
statute
was
designed
to
prevent
people
from
blowing
up
buildings
and
not
to
prevent
people
from
defacing
public
buildings,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
although
it's
probably
not
too
pertinent,
before
this
statute
read
as
it
now
reads,
it
had
the
word
the
face
in
it,
and
the
word
the
face
was
removed.
but
the
supreme
court
rejected
our
argument
on
that
and
we
are
therefore
here
with
the
search
and
seizure
point.
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
well,
i
certainly
mr.
justice
stewart
i
cannot
claim.
i
can
make
no
claim
that
we
push
to
this
point,
we
pursue
this
in
the
trial.
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
we
may
well
not
--
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
well
i
don't
like
to
give
up
on
that
second
one,
but
i
certainly
recognize
that
we
have
a
problem
there.
and
i'm
frank
to
say
that
the
first
point
is
the
one
that
we
really
think
that
is
the
important
one
from
a
constitutional
law
standpoint.
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
well,
if
the
–
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
i
think
that
on
a
question
of
this
kind,
which
has
constitutional
law
overtones
that
if
the
error
--
if
this
court
felt
upon
a
review
of
the
record
that
the
error
was
not
harmless,
that
it
could
review
the
state
court's
determination.
although
i
agree
that
questions
of
harmless
error
when
you
simply
dealing
with
evidence
was
ordinary
rulings
on
evidence.
these
are
state
court
questions
brought
here
--
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
that's
right
your
honor
state
--
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
that's
right,
and
they
be
specifically
made
that
ruling
under
that
statute,
but
i
--
the
only
point
we're
making
on
the
second
one,
and
i
really
--
i
can
only
put
it
the
way
i
put
when
i
put
the
last
one
and
that
is
that
we
just
don't
believe
that
this
is
harmless.
but
we
--
our
main
position
here
is
that
the
court
didn't
reach
that
point
that
the
mere
fact
that
unconstitutionally
seized
evidence
was
admitted
this
year
at
the
whole
trial,
and
the
question
of
prejudice,
questions
of
harmless
error
are
not
before
the
court,
are
not
for
the
court's
consideration.
this
has
been
the
view
of
the
confession
cases
and
others
which
we've
mentioned
in
our
brief.
so
that
i
would
simply
say
that
we
feel
that
error
was
committed,
harmful
error
was
committed
at
the
trial,
but
even
if
the
error
was
properly
could
properly
be
denominated
harmless
that
we're
nevertheless
entailed
to
a
reversal,
and
a
new
trial,
so
that
these
accused
can
be
tried
in
accordance
with
the
due
process,
which
we
feel
they
did
not
have
in
the
first
trial.
mr.
francis
j.
mcnamara,
jr.
nothing
further
your
honor.
