mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
members
of
the
court,
the
state
of
connecticut
does
not
question
the
state
must
contained
in
the
petitioner's
brief
as
to
the
statutes
involved,
the
statement
of
facts,
and
therefore
will
not
reiterate
those.
there
is
only
one
exception.
my
brother
in
his
argument
said
that
when
the
police
officer
went
to
the
residence
on
the
morning
and
questioned,
he
opened
the
garage
door
is
not
accurate,
may
not
have
any
significance
at
all.
it
was
a
wide
open
garage
and
he
walked
in
unmolested
and
he
didn't
have
to
open
any
doorway.
he
didn't
have
to
breakdown
any
partitions
or
anything.
the
garage
physically
was
part
of
the
house,
but
beneath
it
the
living
quarters
were
above,
and
he
simply
walked
in
the
driveway
and
there
was
the
car,
and
he
saw
in
the
car,
nobody
else
in
the
garage,
he
did
see
the
can
of
paint
and
the
paintbrush
on
the
floor
of
the
same
car,
which
earlier
that
same
morning
approximately
4:30
or
the
quarter-to-five
he
had
stopped
on
a
public
highway
in
the
city
of
norwalk,
connecticut,
and
enquired
of
these
two
young
men,
what
they
were
doing
out
at
that
hour
without
any
headlights
lighted.
it
was
dark
at
that
hour
in
the
morning
and
that
was
his
reason
for
stopping
it.
he
was
on
a
routine
police
duty
in
the
radio
car.
and
they
said,
“well,
we
just
went
off
for
some
coffee.
”
and
while
he
was
talking
to
them
at
that
time
and
when
he
looked
in
for
the
automobile,
he
saw
the
jar
of
paint
and
the
brush,
but
he
did
nothing
about
it.
he
took
the
registration
of
the
vehicle
and
allowed
these
young
men
to
go
on
their
way.
now
later
on
that
morning
when
he
was
checking
out
after
his
night's
tour
of
duty,
it
was
little
after
7
o'
clock,
there
was
a
notice
on
the
bulletin
board
of
the
police
headquarters
which
had
comment
from
--
they
complaint
it
for
the
effect
that
someone
has
painted
swastikas
on
a
jewish
synagogue
at
a
certain
location.
then
this
officer,
i
suppose
anxious
and
diligent
to
be
an
efficient
officer,
thought
that
well
that
might
have
been
done
by
these
two
fellows
in
the
car
that
i
stopped
earlier.
it
is
true
he
did
not
obtain
a
search
warrant;
it
is
true
he
did
not
obtain
an
arrest
warrant
at
that
time,
but
on
his
own,
he
went
down
to
this
residence,
he
drove
into
the
driveway,
there
is
the
garage
wide
open,
there
is
the
automobile
in
it.
he
walked
in,
he
looked
in,
there
with
the
can
of
paint
and
a
brush,
he
took
them
went
back
to
police
headquarters.
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
not
at
that
time
mr.
justice
white
no.
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
there
is
--
do
you
mean
at
the
time
he
went
into
the
garage?
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
boys
knew
it
at
that
time.
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
yes.
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
it's
in
the
best
of
my
recollection,
i
did
not
try
this
care
mr.
justice
white.
it's
in
the
best
of
my
recollection
of
the
evidence
is
to
this
effect
that
the
officers
told
them
what
had
happened,
that
they
had
found
the
paintbrush
and
the
paint.
and
it
was
then
and
voluntarily
and
spontaneous
came
out
from,
from
mr.
fahy,
because
he
was
the
one
questioned
that,
well
i
only
did
it
as
a
prank,
those
are
his
exact
quote.
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
well,
justice
--
these
two
men
--
i
think
arnold
was
just
staying
at
his
house
as
a
guest
and
they
were
in
different
bedrooms,
as
i
understand
the
evidence
and
that's
what
fahy
said.
and
while
i
am
on
that
point
i
just
like
to
emphasize
this
that
state
respectfully
claims
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
evidence
to
substantiate
that
there
was
any
false
confessions
here.
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
yes,
yes
mr.
justice
white,
yes
they
did.
they
went
to
their
house
and
they
knocked
at
the
door,
the
evidence
shows
this,
and
they
got
no
response.
this
was,
this
as
approximately
about
9:30
that
same
morning.
the
original
incident
had
occurred
about
4:30
and
about
9:30
that
morning
armed
with
a
search
warrant,
with
an
arrest
warrant
they
went
to
the
house
and
they
finally
awakened
mr.
fahy,
and
they
told
him
their
purpose,
then
they
showed
him
the
search
warrant
or
the
arrest
warrant.
and
it
was
then
that
fahy
said
almost
spontaneously,
he
wasn't
interrogated
and
forced
to
say
that,
he
just
come
out
with
it,
he
says
it's
only
a
prank,
we
only
did
it
as
a
prank.
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
yes
it
was,
or
just
inside
and
--
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
mr.
justice
brennan
i
can't
go
that
far,
i
am
not
--
i
don't
have
that
evidence
at
my
finger
tips,
but
i
would
conclude
that
they
probably
told
them
why
they
were
there
and
why
they
had
a
right
to
go
into
the
house.
and
tha,
of
course,
that
was
a
little
something
further
said
that,
i
don't
want
to
state
here,
unless
i
am
asked
to
state
it,
but
there
was
additional
remarks
made
that
would
be
very
significant
in
this
matter.
but
in
any
event,
that's
what
mr.
fahy
said,
and
they
were
then
arrested
about
9:30
and
taken
on
to
police
headquarters.
then
it
was
at
the
police
headquarters
that
the
then
co-defendant
who
was
no
longer
in
this
case
made
a
written
statement
admitting.
he
was
a
german
alien
and
he
finally
withdrew
his
appeal
to
this
court,
he
surrendered
to
the
authorities
in
connecticut,
and
he
served
his
sentence,
so
he
is
not
in
this
case
whatsoever
at
this
time.
well
now,
i
am
arguing
essentially
from
the
record
in
this
case,
if
it
please
the
court,
and
you
will
note
as
i
have
pointed
out
in
my
brief
--
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
no
i
do
not
mr.
justice
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
i
admit
that.
i
admit
that
and
i
say
it
in
my
brief.
we
have
to
in
view
of
the
mapp
decision.
however,
mr.
justice
warren
this
case
was
decided
in
june
of
1961,
no
june
1960,
your
mapp
decision
i
think
was
in
june
of
'61,
that's
correct.
this
case
was
tried
one
year
prior
to
the
mapp
decision
and
at
that
time,
the
real
arguments
in
this
case
and
the
one
that
the
state
principally
went
up
to
our
state
supreme
court
on
was
they
challenged
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
involving
damage
to
a
public
building.
you
will
see
where
they
filed
demurrers
here,
challenging
the
legal
sufficiency
of
that
information.
we
proceed
with
the
exception
of
catalog
cases
in
connecticut
on
information.
and
they
challenge
the
sufficiency
of
the
information
and
that
it
claimed,
in
the
first
place
they,
they
claimed
that
jewish
synagogue
may
not
come
under
the
category
of
a
public
building.
and
then
they
argued
that
assuming
that
that
is
true
that
to
take
a
paintbrush
and
paint
some
symbols
of
any
kind,
in
this
case
swastikas,
which
have
a
significance
when
they
are
attached
to
a
jewish
synagogue
was
not
a
damage
to
a
public
building.
at
the
most
it
was
just
the
paint
job
and
you
could
come
along
with
some
material
and
you
could
scrub
it
all,
but
that
was
the
basis
for
the
claim,
the
errors
primarily.
although
it
is
true
that
during
the
course
of
the
trial
the
defense
counsel
did
try
to
ask
of
the
arresting
officer
whether
or
not
he
did
have
a
search
warrant
at
the
time,
because
connecticut
did
not
have
the
exclusionary
rule
and
the
objection
was
made,
and
it
was
sustained
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
immaterial
in
a
state
court
by
arrest
of
state
officers
the
manner
in
which
evidence
was
obtained.
so
long
it
was
exclusively
within
the
state
court
and
this
was.
and
for
that
reason
they
allow
that
evidence
in
the
case
and
this,
both
of
these
men
were
found
guilty
by
a
judge
without
the
jury.
now
from
that
time
on,
across
pending
the
appeal
in
the
state
supreme
court
of
connecticut
the
mapp
decision
came
out.
then
immediately,
the
reasons
for
the
basis
for
the
errors
in
this
case
were
predicated
upon
mapp,
entirely
upon
mapp,
and
of
course,
with
mapp
on
their
side,
it
is
a
difficult
problem
for
the
state
of
connecticut
to
argue
that
this
case,
that
this
evidence
was
admissible.
i
do
not
so
argue.
i
admit
that
that
evidence
should
not
have
been
admitted
in
view
of
the
mapp
case.
however,
i
do
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
and
it's
in
my
brief
and
i
can
be
substantiated
by
the
record
here
that
there
was
sufficient
other
evidence
besides
the
paintbrush
and
the
can
to
warrant
a
conviction
of
guilt
in
this
case.
in
the
first
place,
it
was
the
hour
of
the
morning;
in
the
second
place,
this
automobile
was
stopped
originally
within
one
block
of
this
synagogue;
and
thirdly,
the
spontaneous
admission
by
mr.
fahy.
now,
i
use
that
word
spontaneously
advisably.
it
just
isn't
a
word
i
picked
up.
as
soon
as
the
officer
showed
them
this
search
warrant,
the
arrest
warrant,
he
admitted
right
of
the
bat
like
that.
he
wasn't
questioned
into
doing
anything,
he
just
simply,
it
was
a
spontaneous
reaction
what
he
did.
and
he
said,
he
did
it
because
he
thought
it
was
a
prank.
he
was
bored
and
he
felt
that
if
he
did
something
that
had
a
little
excitement
in
it,
well
he'd
feel
better,
and
he
went
off
and
he
did
this
type
of
act,
which
of
course
not
only
violates
the
law
but
it's
an
(inaudible)
act
anyway
to
deface
a
religious
institution.
in
view
of
the
great
principles
of
freedom
of
religion
in
this
country,
of
course,
the
state
had
no
alternative
but
to
present
them
under
these
fcts.
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
yes
mr.
justice
white,
yes
they
were.
as
a
matter
of
fact
at
the
trial,
and
the
transcript
show
it,
substantiate
it,
fahy
and
arnold
both
of
them,
both
took
the
witness
stand
and
admitted
that
they
did
it.
they
said,
yes
we
did
it,
and
they
gave
a
reason
why
they
did
it.
they
said
we
did
it
as
a
prank
and
they
gave
another
reason
which
i
said,
which
i
don't
state
here,
right
now
before
the
court,
but
it's
in
the
record
as
to
why
another
reason
they
gave
for
doing
this.
and
they
readily
admitted
it.
now
the
explanation
as
to
why
they
took
the
witness
stand
and
admitted
it
is
argued,
well
that
was
because
their
coerced
confessions
were
admitted
prior
to.
that
is
not
the
reason
i
respectively
argue,
because
they
were
claiming
that
no
corpus
delicti
had
been
established.
and
our
supreme
court
in
analyzing
the
evidence
show
that
as
i
just
argued
the
location,
the
time,
and
what
was
found
there,
that
all
of
those
would
have
established
that
a
crime
had
been
committed,
whether
or
not
these
or
this
particular
individual
committed
it
or
not
was
a
matter
for
some
additional
proof.
therefore
the
corpus
delicti
had
been
established
and
therefore
whatever
admission
or
confession
was
made
was
admissible.
and
i
don't
like
the
connotation
of
any
coerced
confessions
being
interjected
into
this
case,
because
on
the
record
that
is
not
true,
this
was
all
done
voluntarily.
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
yes
mr.
justice
warren,
they
did
by
putting
on
a
police
officer
who
had
taken
the
paintbrush
and
just
a
little
small
and
about
two-inches
wide
and
went
back
to
the
synagogue,
and
he
matched
the
width
of
the
paintbrush
with
the
width
of
the
broadness
of
this
upper
end
of
the
swastika
and
it
was
the
same
colored
paint.
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
well,
mr.
justice
warren
this
is
my
own
personal
observation,
now
because
you
know
i
did
not
try
this
case.
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
and
i
would
think
that
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
to
obtain
a
conviction
to
introduce
that
type
of
evidence.
i
think
and
i
respectfully
submit
this
that
--
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
well,
i
thought
that
overwhelmingly
against
the
defendant
referred
to
evidence
aliunde
of
the
paint
and
the
paintbrush.
i
think
its
evidence,
otherwise
that
they
found
at
the
crime
and
i
think
that
the
brush
and
paint
were
cumulative
in
nature.
and
just
simply
add
it
to
the
other
facts
down
there,
as
to
which
would
be
sufficient
without
it
to
--
for
a
finding
of
conviction.
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
alright,
well
there
were
two
instances
mr.
justice
warren
where
admissions
were
made.
the
first
was
about
9:30
that
same
morning
when
they
went
to
the
home,
and
i
keep
using
the
words
spontaneously,
i
think
that's
the
only
appropriate
word,
because
that's
exactly
what
fahy
said,
and
he
is
the
one
before
this
court,
arnold
has
given
up.
fahy
said
spontaneously
that
well
i
only
did
it
as
a
prank.
now
that
was
on
february
the
1st.
this
case
did
not
come
to
trial
in
connecticut
until
the
following
june.
so
in
an
entire
interim
of
five
months
approximately
fahy
then
got
on
the
witness
stand
and
said
yes
i
did
it.
and
he
says,
i'll
tell
you
why
i
did
it,
i
did
it
because
i
was
bored
and
life
didn't
seem
very
exciting
and
i
wanted
to
do
something
exciting.
and
he
then
said,
he
went
out
and
painted
these
symbols
on
this
house
of
worship.
so
there
are
two
separate
and
distinct
occasions
of
admissions
or
confessions
approximately
five
months
apart.
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
our
respective
answer,
mr.
justice,
chief
justice
warren
is
this
that
that
line
of
reasoning
never
came
into
existence
until
after
the
mapp
decision.
the
evidence
would
disclose
in
this
case
that
their
objection
to
any
admission
to
this
evidence
at
all
was
primarily
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
it
had
not
been
connected
up
with
their
clients.
they
said,
they
object
and
the
reasons
for
the
objection
they
say,
well
it
hasn't
been
connected
up
with
my
respective
client.
now
that
was
the
basis
for
the
objection
all
through
until
they
got
to
the
one
question
of
this
officer
enquiring
whether
or
not
he
had
a
search
warrant.
the
objection
was
then
made
by
the
then
prosecuting
state's
attorney
and
it
was
sustained
under
then
existing
non
exclusionary
rule
in
connecticut.
so
that
period
of
five
months
--
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
on
the
ground
--
the
ground
for
the
objection
was
that
that
has
not
been
connected
up
to
me,
that's
the
grounds,
and
i
would
assume
that
from
that
position
that
as
soon
as
it
was
connected
up
with
him,
well
then
that
objection
became
invalid.
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
correct,
at
that
time
we
do
not.
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
now
to
answer
to
that
i
go
back
to
my
own
participation
in
this
matter.
i
took
this
case
over
when
i
joined
the
office.
i
argued
that
very
point
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
before
our
own
state
supreme
court.
and
it
was
upon
my
motion
voluntarily
made
that
even
though
this
record
doesn't
present
that
your
honor,
i
think
the
record,
the
transcript
should
be
before
this
court
referring
to
the
state
supreme
court
and
upon
my
motion
joined
of
course
by
brother
mcnamara
at
that
time,
the
transcript
of
the
evidence
came
up.
in
other
words,
i
didn't
want
admitting
before
the
court,
i
didn't
want
anything
left
out
in
this
manner.
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
yes,
well
that's
the
--
the
records
will
substantiate
to
that
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
yes.
in
what
sir?
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
i
believe
so,
yeah
i
have
my
own
transcript
right
here,
but
i
was
looking
at
--
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
well,
mr.
justice
clark
i
remember
this.
when
this
matter
was
in
the
process
of
coming
up
to
this
court,
i
was
not
a
member
of
this
court.
and
i
could
not
sign
any
papers
relating
to
it.
the
man
who
was
named
you
see
and
who
tried
this
case
mr.
lauren
willis
was
no
longer
in
the
state
attorney's
office
in
connecticut,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
out
of
the
state.
so
there
was
no
one
to
sign
papers
as
far
as
i
face
it,
until
i
was
admitted.
so
i
came
down
here
in
the
spring
of
this
year
and
was
admitted.
but
at
that
time,
stipulations
for
the
record
and
things
like
that
had
been
submitted
by
mr.
mcnamara
here
and
had
gotten
into
the
record,
and
i
didn't
have
a
chance
to
(inaudible)
what
constituted
to
the
record.
so
i
am
little
bit
doubtful
whether
or
not
that
whole
transcript
is
before
this
court.
but
it
was
before
the
--
mr.
john
f.
mcgowan
well
fine,
well
fine
all
right,
that
i
didn't
know
of
thank
you,
all
right.
so
i
can
answer
myself
and
for
the
connecticut
supreme
court,
because
i
was
the
one
that
had
brought
up,
i
am
happy
that
it
is
here.
and
when
you
read
it,
you
can
probably
see
what
i
am
referring
to
when
i
don't
like
to
make
a
statement
in
the
public
here
about
some
reference
that
is
made
in
that
case.
so
i'll
leave
it
at
that.
now
therefore,
if
it
please
the
court,
based
upon
this
record
and
the
reasons
that
they
gave,
you'll
see
in
the
finding
at
paragraph
15,
which
is
on
page
12
of
the
record,
that
both
defendants
admitted
that
they
were
the
ones
who
painted
the
swastikas
on
the
synagogue,
and
they
admitted
that
the
paint
and
the
paintbrush
found
in
the
car
had
been
used
by
them
for
that
purpose.
you
see
the
basic
claim
of
this
whole
thing
is
contained
in
paragraph
4
of
the
claimed
error
on
page
13,
the
information
fails
to
charge
an
offense.
they
were
still
arguing
that
to
paint
some
symbol
of
any
kind
on
a
public
building
does
not
come
within
the
purview
of
our
statute.
they
try
to
claim
it
was
only
a
misdemeanor
and
it
could
be
eradicated
by
some
hot
water
or
something
else
by
being
rushed
on
it.
but
the
supreme
court
disregarded
that.
now
that
was
the
prime
reason
of
claimant
that
there
was
no
basis
for
conviction,
and
furthermore
that
the
evidence
was
incredible
upon
which
to
indicate
the
verdict
that
was
filed.
then
as,
mr.
justice
goldberg
has
pointed
out,
our
supreme
court
has
stated
and
i
quote
it
in
my
brief
that
the
defendants
were
not
claimed
nor
the
transcript
show
could
they
claim
that
the
illegal
search
and
seizure
induced
their
admissions
and
confessions.
so
i
respectfully
submit
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
connecticut
the
the
issues
before
this
honorable
court
is
whether
or
not
there
was
any
constitutional
violation
of
this
accused
right
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
it
is
true
since
mapp
and,
of
course,
we
have
changed
our
procedures
out
there
since
then.
we
honor
the
mapp
decision
and
we
do
not
now
offer
evidence
of
this
kind
in
any
further
criminal
position
cases,
and
i
am
in
the
court
practically
everyday
out
there
trying
these
matters,
and
that
is,
i
tell
this
court
that
it
is
now
gone.
however
at
the
time
we
didn't
have
and
we
just
didn't.
now
if
i
am
allowed
by
the
court,
i
would
like
to
cite
a
most
recent
decision
that
i
fortunately
was
advised
off.
it's
dated
september
the
12th
of
1963,
it's
the
case
of
the
people
versus
parham,
p-a-r-h-a-m,
and
it's
out
of
the
state
of
california,
the
supreme
court
of
california,
it's
in
33,
california
report
497.
i
cite
it
to
substantiate
the
position
that
i
advanced
on
behalf
of
the
state
that
the
paint
and
the
brush
were
evidence
cumulative
in
nature.
and
this
decision,
while
it
is
in
on
this
exact
factual
background,
is
a
very,
i
thought,
excellent
analysis
of
what
constitutes
cumulative
evidence
by
a
justice
traynor
of
the
california
supreme
court.
and
it
isn't
too
long
a
decision
and
i
cite
it
as
the
most
recent
work
that
i
could
find
on
this
point
as
far
as
collaborating
the
state's
position
that
this
paintbrush
and
the
paint
itself
were
cumulative
in
nature
and
not
controlling
as
to
the
violation
of
any
constitutional
right
in
dispute
and
i
respectfully
ask
on
behalf
of
the
people
of
state
of
connecticut
that
this
conviction
be
conferred.
