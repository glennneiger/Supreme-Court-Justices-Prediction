number
19,
harold
fahy,
petitioner,
versus
the
state
of
connecticut.
mr.
mcnamara.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcgowan?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
challenge
the
finding
of
the
supreme
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
the
search
and
seize.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
prove
at
the
trial
that
the
paint
that
was
in
this
automobile
was
the
same
paint
that
was
on
the
building?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
would
they
approve
that
if
they
didn't
have
this
unlawfully
obtained
evidence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
i
suppose
is
a
part
of
the
evidence
that
the
court
refers
to
as
being
overwhelmingly
against
the
defendant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
not
reasonable
to
suppose
that
these
young
men
might
not
have
made
those
admissions
if
they
had
not
known
that
the
paint
and
brush
were
in
the
hands
of
the
police?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what,
what
have
you
to
say
to
the
argument
of
counsel
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
unlawfully
obtained
evidence
and
the
results
that
you
obtained
from
it
by
gathering
other
evidence,
that
it's
possible
they
wouldn't
have
been
obliged
to
take
this
stand.
therefore,
they
wouldn't
have
done
it
and
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
rely
on
those
admissions
as
a
part
of
your
overwhelming
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
at
the
trial,
at
the
trial
before
they
made
these
admissions
themselves,
they
did
object
to
the
introduction
of
that
evidence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
they
weren't
enabled
to
pursue
that,
were
they,
that
was
the
initial,
that
was
the
initial
question,
now
how
far
they
would
have
gone
in
cross-examination
to
prove
what
kind
of
a
search
it
was,
no
one
knows,
because
the
court
have
said,
well
now
it
makes
no
difference,
it
makes
no
difference
how
we
obtain
it.
it's
evidenced
in
the
state,
because
we
don't
recognize
the
exclusionary
rule.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
they
couldn't,
they
couldn't
go
any
farther,
they
had
to
recognize
the
evidence,
because
it
was
in
there
before
the
court.
so
then
they
were
faced
with
the
situation
of
what
they
would
do
in
their
defense.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
think
it's
very
frank
to
be
fair
of,
to
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
anything
further
gentlemen?
