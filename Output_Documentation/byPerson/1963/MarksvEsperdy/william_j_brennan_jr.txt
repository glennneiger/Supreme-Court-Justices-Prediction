justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
doesn't
mean
incarceration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that
as
authority
to
--
and
find
him
somewhere
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
tell
me,
mr.
gordon
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(voice

in
this
record,
does
marks
ever
took,
when
he
became
a
member
of
the
cuban
armed
forces,
any
kind
of
oath
or
anything?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
what
i'm
--
i'm
wondering
is
that
i
gather
on
the
--
in
our
armed
forces,
we
have
to
take
an
oath
of
allegiance
(voice

take
that
in
our
armed
forces?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
if
there
had
been
something
like
this,
will
i
gather
your
argument;
you
would
feel
you'd
be
on
weaker
ground?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
--
is
this
generally
an
argument
that
since
one
must
voluntarily
renounce
even
assuming
congress
has
power
to
treat
certain
actions
as
voluntary
renunciation?
historically,
joining
foreign
armed
forces
has
never
been
treated
as
voluntary
renunciation,
therefore
this
may
not
be
and
may
not
constitutionally
be
by
congress,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
suppose
mr.
gordon,
you'd
say
that
even
if
marks
at
least
before
we
get
to
the
1952
statute,
had
to
take
some
kind
of
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
cuban
army.
that
would
not
the
evidence
upon
which
that
could
be
a
conclusion
of
voluntary
renunciation
of
american
citizen.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
that
would
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
long
was
that
been
stated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
understand
mr.
gordon
you're
suggesting
that
it
is
distinguishable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(voice

might
describe
to
--
might
describe
on
your
status
for
voting
in
a
foreign
--
foreign
election,
a
voluntary
renunciation
of
the
american
citizenship
but
now
describe
that
the
service
is
--
the
army
of
that
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
because
you
can't
really
say
that
mere
voting
in
a
foreign
election
can
--
to
that
can
be
attributed
a
voluntary
renunciation
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
for
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
before
you
get
to
the
distinguishable,
why
is
it
indefensible?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
certainly
does
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
--
then
that
does
get
as
back
to
the
problem.
basically
your
arguments
in
the
beginning,
if
i
understood
it
for
further,
has
been
that
an
american
--
at
least
a
native
born
american
citizen
can
never
lose
his
american
citizenship
except
as
he
voluntarily
renunciation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
isn't
your
basic
constitutional
proposition
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
no
american
citizen
may
lose
it
except
that
voluntarily,
he
gives
it
up?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
mean,
mr.
gordon
that
if
he
has
not
come
back
on
january
of
1959,
his
service
with
castro
before
that
date
would
not
have
brought
him
within
this
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
said
he
would
--
when
he
went
back
after
1959,
i
thought,
i
heard
you
say
that
it
was
for
service
with
the
rebel
army?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
the
--
it
was
the
--
it
was
the
army
of
the
then
government
of
cuba
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
--
would
--
if
we
had
it
recognized
as
the
--
as
the
government
of
cuba,
would
it
make
any
difference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
he
admit
he
wrote
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
does
he
admit
he
wrote
it,
was

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
he
deserted
mr.
gordon
in
the
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
accept
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
one
question
mr.
gordon.
i
think
doesn't
he
say
that
if
he
spent
back
to
cuba
and
castro
would
like
that
unless
execute
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
going
to
deport
him
back?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nobody
else
had
wanted
him,
i
gather.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
cuba
wants
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
not
going
to
put
him
on
a
boat
and
just
let

justice
william

brennan,

but
you
did
that
to
one
fellow?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
did
that
to
one
shot
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
finally.
he
was
on
--
on
afloat
for
a
long
time,
was
he
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
nation
still
stands?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

but,
they
can't
vote
and
they
can't
serve
in
the
jury
and
a
matter
of
other
things.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
there
are
other--
other
things
that
happened
to
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we're
not
arguing
that
further
mr.
gordon.
there
are
other
things,
consequences
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
may
be
coming
now,
a
naturalized
citizen?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

now,
when
he
gets
the
citizenship
back,
what
is
it,
naturalized?
justice
william

native
born
american
becomes
a
naturalized
citizen?
