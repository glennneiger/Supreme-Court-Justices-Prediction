army
of
castro,
would
your

be
any
different
from
this
one?
chief

earl
warren
no,
i
understand
--
i
understand
that.
how
about
the
other
iran
countries
that
we
do
have
relationship
with
russia
and
the
czechoslovakia
and
the
rest
of
the
country,
would
that
be
any
different
from
your
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
--
in
what
respect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
course,
it's
obvious
that
there's
a
difference
in
degree
but
i
--
i
wanted
that
the
legal
posture
of
your
case
would
be
different
to
no
certain
terms.

you.
chief

earl
warren
mr.
gordon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
gordon,
let's
talk
about
this
particular
case
for
--
for
a
moment
bearing
on
the
question
of
the
reasonableness
or
the
great
desirability
of
this
as
you
have
---
have
stated
does
in
fact
that
only
panama
and
cuba
and
indonesia
and
turkey.
out
of
all
civilized
countries
of
the
world,
deprived
their
citizenship
of
a
--
of
their
citizenship
for
a
conduct
to
this
kind
bear
on
the
question
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
you've
been
arguing
the
reasonableness
in
world
affairs
and
so
forth.
i
wonder
if
--
i
just
wondered
if
you
consider
that
that
bore
on
the
subject
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
sure
that
if
--
i'm
sure
that
if
all
the
other
countries
except
ours,
though
including
ourselves
had
such
a
law,
you
would
have
cited
that
as
a
--
in
connection
with
the
reasonableness
of
it,
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
well
then
--
then
would
--
then
would
the
fact
that
most,
practically
all
of
the
civilized
countries
of
the
world
do
not
treat
their
citizens
in
that
manner
have
any
bearing
the
other
way?

the
next
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
that
i'm
ahead
of
you
but
