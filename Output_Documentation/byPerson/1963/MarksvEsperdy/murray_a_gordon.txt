mr.
murray
a.
gordon
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
--
certiorari
from
the
second
circuit
which
had
sustained
a
final
order
of
deportation
of
the
immigration
service.
the
case
is
here
in
connection
with
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
challenging
that
final
order
of
deportation.
and
more
particularly,
the
determination
by
the
second
circuit
involved
two
components.
first,
there
was
a
finding
that
the
petitioner
who
is
a
native
born
american
had
been
expatriated
and
lost
his
sole
american
citizenship
rendered
stateless.
as
a
result
of
his
alleged
military
service
in
the
cuban
rebel
army
after
january
of
1959
and
until
may
of
1960.
this
expatriation
was
set
to
follow
from
the
application
of
section
349
(a)
(3)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952.
the
court
of
appeals
further
found
that
the
petitioner,
having
first
lost
his
american
citizenship
and
rendered
an
alien,
and
have
been
passed
in
this
condition
before
he
reentered
the
united
states
in
july
of
1960,
that
he
was
an
alien
at
that
time
and
therefore
was
required
to
have
the
requisite
entry
documents.
and
since
he
did
not
have
such
documents
at
the
time
that
he
returned
to
his
native
country,
he
was
an
excludable
alien
and
for
this
reason,
the
court
below
held
that
the
petitioner
was
not
only
an
alien
but
a
deportable
alien.
i
shall
be
confining
my
discussion
here
today
to
two
principal
questions.
the
first
is
the
constitutionality
of
section
349
(a)
(3)
as
it
was
applied
to
the
petitioner
and
secondly,
the
question
of
his
deportability
even
assuming
him
to
have
been
an
alien.
i
may
say
to
the
court
that
there
are
many
other
questions
which
are
argued
in
the
brief,
but
i
think
this
to
be
the
key
questions
and
i
would
prefer
to
use
my
time
in
the
discussion
of
these
two
and
leave
the
other
questions
so
the
treatment
to
be
found
in
the
briefs.
since
i've
confined
the
questions
which
i
shall
discuss
to
these
two
principal
matters,
i
shall
confine
my
discussion
of
the
facts
to
those
of
record
which
are
relevant
to
these
questions
and
those
facts
are
largely
not
in
controversy.
marks
was
born
in
the
united
states.
he
went
to
cuba
sometime
in
1958.
while
there,
he
joined
the
castro
forces
in
the
hills
and
fought
with
the
revolutionary
forces
against
batista.
in
the
course
of
this
military
activity,
he
rose
to
the
rank
of
captain.
now,
i
should
make
clear
that
no
part
of
the
disability
which
he
now
suffers,
derives
from
his
service
in
the
revolutionary
army
because
section
349
(a)
(3)
provides
that
there
shall
be
law
--
a
loss
of
american
nationality
as
a
result
of
service
in
the
armed
forces
of
a
foreign
state,
provided
that
there
shall
not
first
have
been
specific
authorization
by
the
secretaries
of
defense
and
state
to
engage
in
such
military
service.
apparently
under
the
statute,
engaging
in
military
activity
on
behalf
of
a
revolutionary
force
doesn't
constitute
military
service
on
behalf
of
a
foreign
state
and
therefore,
it
does
not
result
in
expatriation.
consequently,
the
critical
portion
of
his
service
is
a
period
after
january
1959.
this
was
after
batista
had
fallen
and
the
castro
forces
became
the
provisional
and
subsequently,
i
take
it,
the
accepted
government
of
cuba.
the
petitioner
remained
in
the
rebel
army
during
this
period
of
time.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
dispute
in
the
record
whether
the
rebel
army
at
that
time
was
an
armed
force
as
it
is
defined
under
the
statute.
a
great
deal
of
argument
in
the
record
as
to
whether
marks
himself,
engaged
in
any
military
service
during
that
period
of
time.
i
shall
bypass
that
except
to
mention
one
phase
of
that
service
because
i'm
just
sure
as
i'm
standing
here
that
the
--
my
adversary
will
make
reference
to
the
fact
that
for
a
period
of
four
or
five
months,
after
january
of
1959,
marks
supervised
execution
activities
on
behalf
of
the
rebel
army
after
there
had
been
convictions
by
military
tribunals.
the
other
fact
which
is
not
serious
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
january
1959.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
he
was
in
the
states
at
that
time,
your
honor.
he
had
been
wounded
in
the
course
of
his
military
service.
he
came
back
to
the
states
in
november
of
1958
for
medical
treatment.
and
sometime
between
january
2nd
and
january
9th,
i'm
not
sure
of
the
date,
he
returned
to
cuba.
his
testimony
was
that
he
returned
for
the
sake
of
reunion
with
the
man
with
whom
he
had
fought
and
in
addition,
because
he
had
been
promised
land
and
an
opportunity
to
develop
a
farm
of
his
own
there,
this
was
among
the
promises
of
agrarian
reform
which
had
been
made
by
castro.
and
he
has
asserted
this
as
the
reasons
for
his
return
in
january
of
1959.
he
remained
in
cuba,
if
your
honor
pleases,
until
may
of
1960.
when
according
to
his
testimony,
various
anti-communist
activities
in
which
he
had
engaged,
had
caused
him
to
lose
favor
with
the
castro
regime
and
he
said
he
was
in
fear
of
the
cuban
secret
police
and
fled
the
country
on
may
of
1960
and
subsequently
arrived
by
way
of
mexico,
on
july
22,
1960
in
the
states.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
no,
your
honor.
he's
an
american
citizen
born
in
this
country.
the
record
shows
that
he
had
made
one
prior
visit
to
cuba
as
a
seaman,
but
other
than
that,
he
has
no
background
of
either
residence
or
any
other
activity
in
latin
america.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
this
doesn't
appear
in
the
record
but
i
think
i
can
tell
your
honor
that
he
is
of
german
descent.
the
other
fact
of
record
which
i
think
will
not
be
controverted
is
that
there
was
never
any
renunciation
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner,
of
either
his
american
citizenship
or
his
american
allegiance,
quite
the
contrary.
so
far
as
the
record
speaks
to
that
matter,
it
is
quite
clear
that
he
never
intended
to
renounce
his
american
citizenship
or
his
american
allegiance.for
example,
he
was
--
because
of
the
services
to
the
revolutionary
movement,
he
was
eligible
for
cuban
citizenship
if
he
had
chosen
to
avail
himself
of
that.
he
never
did
so
far
as
the
record
shows.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
immigration
service
and
the
courts
below
acknowledged
that
he
is
stateless
as
a
result
of
the
judgment
of
the
courts
below.
he
never
took
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
cuba
so
far
as
the
record
shows
and
he
denies
it
as
part
of
the
record.
during
the
period
of
his
activities
following
january
1959
in
the
rebel
army,
on
frequent
occasion,
he
landed
--
he
led
a
to
the
fbi,
to
the
cia,
to
the
american
consulate.
this
too
was
not
disputed
in
the
record,
nor
is
it
disputed
then
in
so
doing,
he
sometimes
subjected
himself
to
personal
jeopardy.
and
when
in
february
of
1960,
he
was
handed
a
notice
from
the
state
department
that
his
military
service
in
cuba,
resulted
in
his
denationalization.
he
promptly
protested
it
in
a
press
conference
which
was
widely
reported.
as
i
have
said,
he
left
the
country,
cuba,
may
of
1960.
he
came
back
to
this
country
in
july
of
1960.
his
experience
here
was
uneventful
until
january
25th
of
1961,
when
two
officers
of
the
immigration
service
came
to
an
apartment
where
he
was
staying
presumably
who
questioned
him.
now,
the
exact
basis
for
the
questioning
is
in
controversy
in
the
record
and
i
will
not
go
into
the
details
of
that
except
to
tell
you
that
after
first
being
interviewed
at
8
o'clock
in
this
apartment,
he
then
went
to
the
immigration
service
officers
in
new
york
at
9
o'clock.
there,
he
was
questioned
for
a
period
of
approximately
five
hours.
at
the
end
of
the
period
of
questioning,
a
statement
was
prepared
for
him
in
the
handwriting
of
one
of
the
agents,
containing
a
--
a
narrative
form
of
statement
rather
than
question
and
answer.
much
of
the
language
in
that
statement
was
the
language
of
the
investigator
rather
than
of
marks'
and
then
at
least
one
particular,
the
statement
was
holding
inaccurate.
that
statement
was
then
submitted
to
marks
to
sign,
he
signed
it
and
he
was
promptly
then
advised
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
under
arrest.
he
was
taken
to
the
federal
detention
headquarters
in
new
york
and
placed
a
maximum
security
and
there,
he
remained
for
a
period
of
approximately
nine
months
when
for
the
first
time,
we
were
able
to
obtain
bail
upon
the
institution
of
the
present
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
there
were
hearings
before
a
special
inquiry
officer
that
ended
on
april
6
and
that
inquiry
officer
took
until
the
end
of
may
to
render
his
decision.
and
throughout
this
period
of
time,
marks
was
detained.
an
application
was
made
for
his
release
on
habeas
corpus,
it
was
denied,
pending
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies.
applications
were
made
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
for
his
release
pending
his
--
pending
the
determination
of
these
proceedings.
that
was
denied.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
they
affirmed
the
order
of
deportation
and
finally
we
were
able
to
begin
these
proceedings.
initially,
the
district
court
judge
fixed
bail
of
$10,000.
the
petitioner
couldn't
raise
that
kind
of
money.
it
was
subsequently
reduced,
bail
was
raised.
in
october,
he
was
released
and
he
is
out
on
bail
at
the
present
time.
the
district
court
found
that
the
finding
of
alien
--
of
alienate
was
warranted
under
section
349
(a)
(3),
but
held
that
he
was
not
deportable.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
on
the
second
phase,
it
held
that
not
only
was
marks
an
alien
and
stateless,
but
he
is
deportable.
and
this
therefore,
represents
the
first
instance
of
a
case
before
this
court
of
a
native
born
american
who
has
never
voluntarily
renounced
his
american
citizenship
and
never
acquire
the
citizenship
of
another
country,
being
found
to
be
stateless
and
deportable
to
any
country
who
is
willing
to
accept
him.
marks
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
there
were
two
grounds
asserted
for
his
deportability
by
the
immigration
service.
first,
that
at
the
time
of
his
entry
in
this
country
in
1960,
he
was
an
alien.
the
theory
was
that
he
denationalized
himself
automatically
by
this
foreign
military
service
and
from
that
moment
on,
although
i
don't
know
whether
it's
the
first
moment
of
that
service
or
the
last
moment
of
that
service,
whichever
moment
it
maybe,
he
was
then
denationalized
an
alien.
now,
when
he
came
into
the
country
at
that
time,
he
had
a
background
of
a
prior
conviction
for
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude.
so
they
said
he
was
an
excludable
alien
because
of
this
conviction.
they
also
said
he
was
an
excludable
alien
because
he
did
not
have
the
requisite
and
pre-documents
as
an
alien.
now,
the
district
court
said,
that
as
he
reads
the
statute,
it
requires
a
conviction
not
at
the
time
that
one
is
an
--
an
alien
but
he
found
as
this
court
has
found
in
costello,
that
since
the
conviction
took
place
in
1952
and
he
was
a
citizen
at
that
time,
that
could
not
be
a
basis
for
his
exclusion
or
his
deportability.
he
also
found
with
respect
to
the
entry
documents
that
not
until
there
had
been
a
judicial
determination
of
his
expatriation,
could
it
be
concluded
that
he
was
in
fact
an
alien.
consequently,
he
found
that
there
was
no
requirement
for
entry
documents
as
of
that
time.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
go
into
the
conviction
question.
i
think
that
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
he
decided
therefore
that
neither
of
the
two
bases
asserted
for
the
excludability
and
therefore
the
deportability
of
the
petitioner
could
be
sustained
under
the
statutes.
and
for
that
reason,
he
held
that
marks
was
not
deportable.
have
i
explained
that
to
your
honor's
satisfaction?
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
no,
no,
i'm
aware
--
at
that
time
your
honor,
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
--
there
were
no
prohibitions
at
that
time.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
recognized
cuba
very
promptly.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
and
your
honor
may
recall
the
white
paper
issued
by
the
state
department
in
april
of
1961
which
is
in
the
record
here,
which
indicated
that
as
of
that
time,
the
administration
look
with
favor
upon
the
efforts
made
by
castro
to
overthrow
what
the
state
department
paper
refers
to
as
the
tyranny
of
batista
and
to
institute
the
great
social
reforms
which
were
long
overdue
in
that
country.
that
was
the
attitude
of
our
country
at
that
time.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
there
is
--
under
the
neutrality
act
of
1818
which
was
now
section
959
of
title
18,
if
one
enlists
in
this
country
for
military
service
abroad,
that
is
a
crime,
but
to
enlist
abroad
for
military
service
abroad
is
not
a
crime
under
the
criminal
code
of
--
of
this
county.
and
so
the
condition
of
marks
as
of
this
moment
is
that
after
having
served
nine
months
in
maximum
security,
he's
lost
his
american
citizenship.
he
is
stateless.
he
is
deportable
to
any
country
which
will
accept
him.
in
the
event
this
court
should
affirm
the
final
order
of
the
immigration
service,
the
attorney
general
may
take
him
into
his
custody
once
again
and
keep
him
in
custody
for
a
period
of
at
least
six
months
while
trying
to
find
some
country
who
will
accept
marks
as
a
deportee.
if
he
is
ultimately
deported,
if
a
country
is
found
to
accept
him,
he
cannot
return
to
this
country
except
with
the
explicit
consent
of
the
attorney
general.
if
on
the
other
hand,
no
country
accepts
him
as
a
deportee,
as
i
read
section
242
(c)
of
the
nationality
act
of
1952,
he
may
certainly
be
kept
on
the
perpetual
or
at
least
indefinite
supervision.
and
the
court
is
familiar
with
the
full
meaning
of
that
after
the
wit
of
its
case,
i'm
sure.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
no
but
it
isn't
clear
to
me
your
honor,
section
242
(c)
talks
as
follows,
that
if
he
cannot
be
deported
within
that
six-month
period,
the
initial
six-month
period,
the
language
of
the
statute
is
that
he
is
subject
to
further
supervision
and
detention
pending
eventual
deportation.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
that
appears
in
section
242
(c)
of
the
nationality
act
of
1952.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
that
hasn't
been
so
treated
by
the
courts
or
by
the
attorney
general.
i'm
merely
referring
to
the
language
in
the
statute.
it
is
true
that
under
section
244
of
the
act
of
1952,
after
a
period
of
seven
years
and
a
showing
of
good
moral
character,
assuming
that
marks
hasn't
been
deported
by
that
time
to
whatever
country
will
accept
him;
he
can
make
an
application
for
change
of
status
as
a
lawful
permanent
resident.
but
that
requires
not
only
the
consent
of
the
attorney
general,
but
is
subject
to
review
by
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
senate.
and
i
think
it
is
not
a
rush
guessed
say
that
is
most
unlikely.
in
view
of
the
background
of
the
petitioner,
that
it
is
most
unlikely
that
permission
will
ever
be
granted
to
this
man
to
become
a
lawful
resident
of
the
united
states.
now,
i
think
that
any
discussion
of
section
349
(a)
(3)
has
to
be
preceded
by
a
discussion
of
the
background
of
how
this
country
has
treated
foreign
military
service
relative
to
the
question
of
expatriation.
that
type
of
treatment
is
not
consistently
made
on
either
of
the
briefs
before
your
honors
and
so
i
shall
dwell
upon
that
at
some
length.
until
1868,
this
court,
this
country
did
not
generally
recognized
the
right
of
expatriation
even
where
the
individual
will
be.
incompatible
with
that
attitude,
the
early
cases
on
the
subject
consistently
rejected
the
notion
that
military
service
abroad
constituted
the
basis
for
expatriation.
congress
had
the
question
before
it
twice,
first,
in
1797
and
then
again
in
1880,
both
in
connection
with
legislation
dealing
with
privateers
and
enlisting
to
serve
in
foreign
military
service.
in
both
instances,
the
congress
rejected
the
concept
that
foreign
military
service
would
constitute
a
basis
for
expatriation.
but
i
think
in
all
fairness,
it
should
be
said
that
that
was
part
of
the
general
attitude
that
there
could
be
no
expatriation
even
if
the
individual
will
be.
the
first
time
that
the
concept
of
the
voluntary
right
of
renunciation
of
citizenship
became
a
governing
principle
in
our
laws,
is
under
the
laws,
the
act
of
1868,
following
the
great
opinion
of
attorney
general
black.
and
the
concept
was
there
enunciated
in
general
language
that
every
individual
had
the
right
to
expatriate
himself.
it
did
not
undertake
to
enumerate
what
kinds
of
acts
would
constitute
expatriation?
that
was
left
to
the
interpretation
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
if
you
please,
by
the
secretary
of
state
as
the
problems
arose.
and
i
think
it
will
be
acknowledged
that
the
consistent
interpretation
of
the
act
of
1868
was
that
military
service
abroad,
where
there
was
no
oath
of
allegiance
taken
to
the
foreign
country
and
whose
service
the
individual
was
engaged,
was
no
basis
for
expatriation.
yes,
the
state
department
did
withhold
diplomatic
protection
of
the
individual
unless
if
there
was
a
condition
of
what
they
characterize
as
inhuman
treatment.
but
other
than
that,
the
consistent
attitude
taken
by
the
executive
branch
of
this
government
from
1868
and
as
we'll
be
seeing
down
to
1952
was
that
if
an
individual
engaged
in
military
service
abroad
but
took
no
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
foreign
power
involved,
he
did
not
by
such
military
service
alone,
renounced
his
american
citizenship
or
--
or
his
allegiance
because
it
was
understood
that
it
was
quite
plausible
to
undertake
to
fight
battles
of
foreign
countries
and
still
retained
an
allegiance
to
this
country.
it
was
properly
remembered
that
kosciusko,
that
la
follette
--
lafayette
during
the
revolutionary
war,
fought
in
behalf
of
the
american
forces,
revolutionary
forces.
that
they
were
a
contingent
of
6000
french
troops
who
supported
him
and
it
was
understood
that
they
never
lost
their
french
citizenship.
it
was
probably
remembered
that
during
the
civil
war,
thousands
of
germans
came
to
this
country
and
assisted
the
northern
forces
in
the
civil
war
and
not
only
never
lost
their
german
citizenship
but
were
paid
pensions
by
the
united
states
when
they
returned
to
germany
to
enjoy
their
german
citizenship.
now
in
1907,
there
was
the
first
attempt
in
statutory
form
to
codify
the
instances
of
expatriation.
instead
of
the
general
language
of
the
act
of
1868,
there
were
a
few
précised
instances
which
were
now
enumerated
which
would
constitute
renunciation
of
american
citizenship,
expatriation.
and
when
it
came
to
the
question
of
service
abroad,
the
act
codified
and
made
explicit,
the
line
of
interpretation
by
the
state
department
that
only
foreign
service,
where
there
had
been
an
oath
of
allegiance
taken
to
the
foreign
power
involved,
would
be
the
basis
for
expatriation
and
that
was
a
situation
down
to
the
enactment
of
the
nationality
act
of
1952
because
the
adoption
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940
did
not
truly
change
the
line
of
construction
which
i've
indicated.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
no,
he
denied
that
your
honor
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
to
the
contrary.
nothing
in
the
record.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
finding
by
the
immigration
service
is
that
he
is
stateless.
and
from
that,
i
assume
that
he
took
no
oath
of
allegiance
to
his
citizenship.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well
he
was
--
he
first
started
--
yes,
i
think
that
is
true
your
honor.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
no
question.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
no
question.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
until
1952,
that
was
the
experience.
i
shall
want
to
amplify
the
position
on
that
score
but
i
think
that
states
it
essentially.
in
1940,
after
five
years
of
study
by
a
cabinet
committee
appointed
by
then
president
roosevelt,
it
was
proposed
that
a
certain
series
of
acts
shall
be
deemed
as
an
indication
of
a
transfer
of
allegiance
from
this
country
to
another
country.
and
among
the
acts
so-referred
to,
was
foreign
military
service,
this
time
without
reference
to
an
oath
or
taking
on
the
allegiance
or
the
citizenship
of
the
foreign
country.
it
is
rather
interesting
that
in
the
proposal
for
such
legislation,
mr.
(inaudible)
who
is
the
assistant
legal
adviser
of
the
state
department
testifying
in
support
of
the
proposed
bill
said
that,
it
does
not
seem
reasonable
that
a
person
should
give
himself
up
and
risk
his
life
for
the
good
of
a
foreign
state
and
remain
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
although
it
maybe
reasonable
to
provide
for
recovering
citizenship
readily
in
such
cases.
in
other
words,
it
was
still
made
clear
that
the
option
to
be
an
american
citizen
or
to
lose
the
american
citizenship
was
to
be
left
with
the
individual.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
how
the
nationality
act
of
1940
comes
out.
because
while
the
house
bill
provides
the
denationalization,
irrespective
of
any
alternative
citizenship
or
taking
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
a
foreign
country,
the
senate
revised
the
bill
and
it
was
the
senate
revision
which
was
adopted.
that
senate
revision
provided
that
there
would
be
loss
of
american
citizenship
for
foreign
military
service,
if
the
individual
either
had
or
required
the
citizenship
of
that
other
country.
now
that
took
care
of
two
situations.
it
took
care
of
the
situation
of
one
acquiring
the
foreign
nationality
or
taking
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
foreign
country
in
conjunction
with
entering
the
military
service,
one
that
took
care
of
another
problem
which
was
concerning
the
congress
at
that
time.
it
was
the
problem
of
dual
nationality.
it
was
the
problem
of
the
individual
who
came
to
this
country,
became
a
naturalized
american
citizen
and
went
abroad
and
when
conscripted
into
the
service
of
his
native
land,
invoked
american
intervention
on
the
grounds
that
he
was
an
american
citizen.
now
to
a
great
extent,
that
problem
had
been
solved
by
a
series
of
treating
known
as
the
bancroft
treaties
starting
in
the
latter
part
of
the
19th
century,
but
it
was
still
a
residual
problem.
i
may
say
that
there
was
practically
no
discussion
in
the
congressional
debates
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
act
of
1940,
very
little
discussion
in
the
reports
and
just
a
bear
smattering
of
discussion
relative
to
this
problem
at
the
hearings,
none
of
which
bears
upon
the
problems
we
have
actually.
in
the
adoption
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940,
it
was
also
provided
that
those
persons
who
had
been
in
a
foreign
military
service
of
an
ally
during
world
war
i
and
subsequently
this
was
extended
to
service
in
the
armed
forces
of
an
ally
in
world
war
ii,
could
very
quickly
recover
their
american
citizenship
simply
by
taking
an
oath
of
affirmation
and
repudiating
any
other
citizenship
they
may
have
acquired.
all
other
forms
of
military
service
could
be
the
basis
for
re-naturalization
under
section
317
(c)
of
the
act
of
1940,
by
the
ordinary
naturalization
procedures
except
you
didn't
have
to
wait
five
years.
and
so,
it
was
clear
under
the
nationality
act
of
1940
that
a
man
could
regain
his
american
citizenship
rather
expeditiously
if
that
was
his
intention.
and
so
in
that
effect,
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940
was
not
substantially
to
alter
the
basic
concept
that
renunciation
of
american
citizenship
in
connection
with
foreign
military
service
was
a
voluntary
matter.
the
change
takes
place
in
1952
and
what
i
can
only
characterize
is
a
piece
of
freak
legislation
in
view
of
the
substantial
interest
which
were
involved.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
i
would
take
that
position
although
that's
not
the
question
here.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
there
--
there
is
a
separate
provision
in
the
act,
however,
and
it
seems
to
have
been
a
part
of
the
consistent
pattern
of
administrative
determination
that
if
one
takes
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
a
foreign
country,
that
is
deemed
a
voluntary
act
of
expatriation.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
that
has
been
so
since
the
interpretation
of
the
act
of
1868,
however,
i
think
that
would
be
another
question
which
i
would
be
prepared
to
argue
to
this
court.
the
record
here,
however
--
the
record
here
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
quite
the
contrary,
he
denied
it
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
anything
to
the
contrary.
in
1950
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
i
think
it
might
because
your
honor,
i
think
the
facts
here
show
that
his
participation
in
the
rebel
army
activities,
in
the
early
part
of
the
castro
regime,
was
not
incompatible
with
an
allegiance
to
this
country
because
the
attitude
towards
the
castro
regime
during
that
period
of
time
was
very
different
from
what
it
is
today.
moreover,
one
could
argue
that
the
--
the
nature
of
the
hostility
between
these
countries
as
such
that
a
much
stronger
argument
could
be
made
out
that
service
in
that
army
at
the
present
time
would
be
incompatible
with
an
allegiance
to
this
country,
but
that's
not
the
case
we
have
at
present
time
your
honor.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
i
think
it
would
your
honor.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
i
think
that
it
could,
with
less
forcibility
be
argued,
then
i
am
arguing
here
that
that
foreign
service
does
not
indicate
any
inconsistency
between
allegiance
with
this
country
and
the
intention
to
retain
american
citizenship.
i
think
service
in
the
armed
forces
of
a
country,
where
there's
a
potential
of
war
between
those
countries,
where
there
is
a
basic
political
hostility
between
those
countries,
makes
the
question
a
more
difficult
one.
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
in
the
last
analysis,
this
should
be
the
issue
of
fact
to
be
tried
out
in
a
proper
proceeding.
but
if
you're
asking
me
my
off-the-cuff
reaction
to
the
differences
between
these
situations,
it
is
that
i
think
that
it
would
be
less
plausible
to
argue
the
retention
of
american
allegiance
and
the
case
of
service
in
iron
curtain,
military
force
and
it
was
under
the
facts
in
this
case.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
substantially
not,
your
honor
because
ultimately,
i
think
this
comes
down.
the
only
way
section
349
(a)
(3)
could
be
sustained
in
my
opinion
is
to
make
relevant
an
inquiry
into
the
question
of
intent.
that
should
be
the
issue
of
fact.
it
is
in
fact
suggested
by
mr.
justice
black's
concurring
opinion
on
nishikawa
case.
i
think
that's
the
proper
inquiry
in
these
cases.
and
so
the
basic
legal
proposition
would
be
the
same
in
both
instances.
the
factual
consequences
might
well
be
different
your
honor.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
that's
the
trouble
the
statute
your
honor.
i
think
the
statute
is
such
as
to
bring
within
its
scope
those
who
never
transferred
their
allegiance
from
this
country
as
well
as
those
who
did,
and
that's
the
problem
i
find
with
this
statute.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
yes,
i
certainly
intend
to
your
honor,
but
i
will
anticipate
it
to
this
extent.
i
think
that
this
case
is
much
closer
to
mendoza
than
it
is
to
perez,
partly
because
of
the
history
of
this
statue
which
i
should
like
to
complete
briefly
and
partly
because
in
this
case,
like
mendoza
but
unlike
perez,
there
is
a
finding
which
results
in
statelessness
and
that
i
suggest
is
a
qualitative
difference
between
trapp,
mendoza
and
perez.
now
in
1950,
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
no,
you
cannot
your
honor.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
that
is
correct.
i
merely
said
this
case
is
closer
to
mendoza.
the
case
is
different
from
mendoza.
no
--
no
doubt
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
in
the
plurality
opinion
of
mr.
chief
justice
warren
in
the
trapp
case,
a
special
quality
of
state
was
this
--
was
the
basis
for
the
plurality
position,
namely
that
that
is
a
certain
kind
of
punishment.
i
would
go
further
in
say
however,
your
honor,
there
is
no
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well
i
believe
if
your
honor
will
bear
with
me
on
that,
i
think,
the
point
is
in
the
trapp
case,
the
plurality
opinion
that
statelessness
was
different
from
ordinary
deportation.
and
while
it
is
true
that
there
was
a
punitive
intent
in
the
legislation,
another
very
crucial
fact
that
--
in
that
case,
was
that
statelessness
had
a
special
quality
which
brought
it
within
the
eight
amendment.
it
is
true
that
it
was
first
defining
that
it
was
a
penalty,
but
then
it
was
a
very
special
kind
of
penalty
and
i
say
it
to
your
honor,
that
the
government
here
today,
will
be
arguing
to
this
court
that
there
is
a
qualitative
difference
between
depriving
of
person
of
sole
american
nationality,
of
his
american
citizenship
and
a
person
of
dual
nationality,
because
on
the
schneider
case,
if
your
honor
pleases,
the
government
will
be
put
to
the
proposition
of
explaining
why
it
treats
a
naturalized
citizen
with
dual
citizenship,
different
from
a
person
with
sole
american
citizenship.
now
in
1950,
the
senate
judiciary
committee
then
under
the
chairmanship
of
senator
mccarran,
issued
a
report
in
which
he
suggested
that
it
was
most
unfortunate
and
improper
that
the
denationalizing
effect
of
foreign
military
service
should
be
made
dependent
upon
whether
one
had
taken
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
a
foreign
country.
from
his
point
of
view,
loss
of
american
citizenship
should
be
predicated
upon
what
our
laws
prescribed
and
not
upon
to
protrude
a
circumstance
of
what
a
foreign
country
may
require
as
a
condition
for
a
military
service.
and
he,
therefore,
recommended
that
there
should
be
denationalization
in
all
instances
of
foreign
military
service,
another
word
--
another
word
in
the
report
that
this
would
result
in
statelessness,
no
debates
on
the
subject,
no
hearings
on
the
subject.
but
in
1952,
the
adoption
of
the
recommendation
of
the
senate
committee
report
without
one
word,
anywhere
to
be
found
that
this
would
result
in
a
condition
of
statelessness
in
some
cases.
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
your
honors
will
see
shortly
in
all
cases
of
any
significance
under
349
(a)
(3)
because
after
the
decision
of
this
court
in
nishikawa,
which
held
that
where
a
dual
national
is
conscripted
into
the
military
service
of
his
--
of
his
native
land,
he
doesn't
lose
his
american
citizenship.
what
that
means
then
is
that
only
in
the
case
of
a
native
american,
who
voluntarily
enters
into
a
foreign
military
service.
is
there
going
to
be
a
loss
of
american
citizenship?
and
so
the
sole
practical
effect
where
there
is
no
voluntary
renunciation
of
american
citizenship,
the
sole
practical
effect
today
of
section
349
(a)
(3)
is
to
render
a
person
who
has
not
renounced
his
american
citizenship,
because
that
would
cause
expatriation
under
other
sections
of
the
nationality
act,
to
render
such
a
person
statements.
this
is
the
sole
residual
meaning
and
impact
of
section
349
(a)
(3).
the
act
of
1952
did
still
another
thing.
you
may
recall
that
i
mention
that
the
act
of
1940
permitted
a
safety
valve.
a
man
could
very
quickly
and
easily
become
pre-naturalized
under
section
317
(c)
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940.
that
was
eliminated
without
as
the
government
says
in
its
brief,
without
any
discussion
or
justification.
there
is
no
way
to
recoup
american
citizenship.
so
far
as
i
can
tell,
after
this
loss
under
section
349
(a)
(3)
as
it
now
stands.
now,
i
think
that
it
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
no,
your
honor.
any
alien
would
have
his
native
citizenship.
this
man
is
state
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
so
far
--
yes
that
is
correct
your
honor.
he
could
acquire
it
after
five
years
residence
and
the
establishment
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
--
of
good
moral
character.
he
would
be
in
the
same
condition
from
that
point
of
view
as
any
other
alien.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
as
i
read
the
legislative
history
of
this
act,
its
true
lust
and
purpose
is
to
say
that
if
a
man
engages
in
foreign
military
service,
that
that
is
tantamount
to
a
voluntary
renunciation
of
his
american
allegiance
and
citizenship.
that's
what
this
act
does,
that's
what
it
was
intended
to
do.
and
that's
what
senator
mccarran
made
clear
when
he
equated
the
--
the
american
citizen
who
takes
a
note
of
allegiance
to
a
foreign
country
with
an
american
citizen
who
doesn't
take
such
a
note.
historically,
taking
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
a
foreign
power
was
demonstrative
of
a
renunciation
of
american
allegiance.
by
equating
these
two
situations,
as
he
did
explicitly
in
that
report,
he
was
indicating
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
purpose
on
descendible
--
discernable
purpose.
in
349
(a)
(3),
he
was
saying
that
foreign
military
service
demonstrates
conclusively
and
creates
an
irrebutable
presumption
if
you
please,
of
an
intention
to
renounce
american
citizenship
and
american
allegiance.
any
such
presumption
i
suggest,
is
contrary
to
experience.
you
cannot
look
at
the
history
of
the
interpretation
of
the
act
of
1868
for
almost
85
years,
which
may
precisely
this
distinction,
which
held
that
voluntary
military
service
abroad
where
there
was
no
oath
of
allegiance
did
not
demonstrate
a
renunciation
of
american
allegiance.
you
cannot
look
to
that
by
your
experience.
you
cannot
look
to
the
experience
of
our
young
people
in
world
war
i
and
world
war
ii
going
to
support
the
allied
forces
before
we
entered
the
war.
you
cannot
look
to
the
experience
of
those
members
of
the
jewish
faith
before
on
the
side
of
israel.
you
cannot
look
to
the
experience
of
what
happened
during
the
spanish
civil
war
and
pleasantly
say,
that
so
long
is
a
man
engages
in
military
service
abroad
or
some
other
country,
he
is
giving
up
his
allegiance
to
this
country
quite
in
contrary.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
your
--
this
court
has
decided
that
question
in
the
kolokitha
case.
you
may
recall
that
service
for
japan
with
a
slavish
as
mr.
justice
clark
was
referred
to
a
slavish
angulation
as
it
were
of
the
japanese
regime.
since
he
was
a
dual
national,
did
not
constitute
a
repudiation
of
his
american
allegiance
had
it
done
so,
he
could
not
have
been
prosecuted
for
treason
because
he
wouldn't
have
been
an
american
citizen.
i
think
ultimately
if
your
honor
pleases,
that
this
is
a
question
of
fact
which
cannot
be
foreclosed
by
any
kind
of
irrebutable
presumption
on
the
part
of
congress.
i
didn't
go
so
far
in
this
case
however,
because
in
this
case,
i
think
the
facts
really
leave
no
serious
doubt
that
there
was
never
an
intention
to
renounce
american
allegiance
or
american
citizenship.
i
think
in
the
last
analysis
however,
the
question
should
be
a
question
of
fact
to
be
tried
before
a
jury
as
to
whether
there
was
a
genuine
intention
to
renounce
allegiance
to
this
country
because
you
cannot
otherwise
takeaway
a
man's
american
citizenship
in
my
judgment,
compatible
with
the
constitution.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
that's
correct.
i
think
that
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
i
think
not
your
honor
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
i
--
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that
dealing
first
as
we
do
with
the
condition
of
statelessness,
we
have
a
qualitatively
different
situation
on
the
cases
up
to
now.
i
think
when
the
question
is
whether
an
individual
has
selected
one
of
two
nationalities
by
an
act
such
as
voting
or
marriage.
marriage,
that
case
of
course
as
your
honor
knows,
was
a
temporary
abatement
of
american
citizenship
or
comparable
situations
involving
an
election
between
one
or
two
dual
nationalities.
first
of
all,
it
falls
into
the
context
of
a
very
special
type
of
problem
that
the
congress
had
where
there
are
conflicting
claims
of
sovereignty
between
two
countries,
which
i
think
is
not
at
all
present
here.
secondly,
i
think
that
what
would
be
sufficient
to
constitute
an
election
of
one
or
two
nationalities,
poses
in
my
judgment,
a
very
different
kind
of
problem
from
an
election
which
results
in
a
repudiation
of
american
allegiance
and
citizenship
and
statelessness.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
on
two
grounds.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
i
would
hope
that
this
court
would
reconsider
perez.
i
should
say
that
at
the
outset.
i
do
notice
that
your
honor,
in
the
mendoza
case,
referred
to
some
deep
felt
doubts
that
you
had
concerning
the
correctness
of
your
position
in
the
perez
case.
i
think
ultimately,
perez
is
indefensible
as
a
proposition
of
constitutional
law.
i
think
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
no,
not
for
that
reason
your
honor.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
not
for
that
reason.
i
think
perez
is
indefensible
not
because
it's
indistinguishable
but
because
it's
indefensible
as
a
proposition
of
constitutional
law.
but
i
think
in
addition,
the
case
--
the
case
is
distinguishable
for
two
reasons,
first
that
there
is
a
historical
context
for
the
340
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
why
is
it
indefensible?
because
i
think
that
perez
ultimately
depends
not
upon
the
proposition
that
the
voting
indicated
a
voluntary
renunciation
of
american
citizenship.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
it
does
not.
there's
no
such
discussion
in
that
case.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
in
the
area
of
military
service
which
is
my
case
here
today,
what
i
am
arguing
is
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
i
think
that's
a
basic
constitutional
proposition
but
i
go
further
in
this
case
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
no,
i
think
only
the
perez
case
would
be
all
wrong
because
only
the
perez
case
went
to
the
question
in
my
judgment,
are
the
repudiation
of
american
allegiance
rather
than
an
election
of
an
ultimate
nationality,
and
i
think
those
are
two
very
different
propositions
your
honor.
i
would
say,
mr.
justice
brennan
that
perez
was
not
argued
or
treated
in
the
historical
context
which
is
present
here.
i
think
that
we
can
understand
that
section
349
(a)
(3)
in
terms
of
its
historical
background,
was
based
upon
a
rather
clear
congressional
purpose
to
announce
that
service
abroad
is
tantamount
to
a
renunciation
of
american
allegiance.
there
was
no
such
showing
of
a
legislative
history
or
intention
in
the
case
of
perez
and
the
reason
why
that
is
most
significant
in
my
judgment
is
because
if
this
legislation
is
an
attempt
to
make
a
determination
by
the
congress
that
foreign
military
service
without
more
creates
the
irrebutable
presumption
of
a
renunciation
of
american
allegiance
and
that
is
the
meaning
of
349
(a)
(3)
when
understood
in
its
historical
context
and
this
was
never
discussed
in
perez
nor
in
the
other
cases
referred
to
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
if
that
is
so,
then
the
legislative
history
here
indicates
that
the
congress
was
undertaken
to
delineate
an
irrebutable
presumption
which
is
contrary
to
experience
and
for
that
reason
as
unconstitutional.
now,
if
the
congress
was
saying,
however,
not
that
all
instances
of
foreign
military
service
are
demonstrative
of
a
renunciation
of
american
allegiance,
but
that
many
are
and
therefore,
they
can
be
nationalized
for
all
instances
of
foreign
military
service,
then
this
case
does
come
within
mendoza,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
and
squarely,
because
it
is
quite
difficult
of
criminal
penal
legislation
to
say,
"we're
not
going
to
undertake
to
determine
whether
every
kind
of
proscribed
act
is
or
is
not
socially
harmful."
we
will
punish
all
action
of
a
defined
character
so
as
to
deter
all
such
action
whether
potentially
or
actually,
socially
undesirable,
we
punish
it
be
--
for
purposes
of
deterrence.
if
the
purpose
here,
therefore,
was
to
expatriate
because
many
instances
of
foreign
military
service
were
demonstrative
of
a
foreign
allegiance
and
this
was
one
way
of
deterring
such
activity,
then
this
comes
within
mendoza.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
is
precisely
the
way
the
united
nations
has
construed
legislation
of
this
sort.
in
1949,
the
secretary
of
the
un
published
a
study
called
"a
study
of
statelessness."
since
i
don't
refer
to
what
my
brief,
i
should
like
to
read
it
very
briefly
to
your
honor.
at
pages
140
--
page
140
of
that
study,
after
making
a
study
of
this
subject
throughout
the
world,
they
have
a
caption,
"the
deprivation
of
nationality
as
a
penalty."
cases
of
individual
forfeiture
of
nationality
as
a
penalty
are
frequent
and
vary
from
country-to-country.
in
such
cases,
the
state
accuses
one
of
its
nationals
of
committing
an
act
or
adopting
an
attitude
contrary
to
its
interests.
the
main
grounds
for
the
deprivation
of
nationality
as
a
penalty
are
ascertained
to
be
following,
(a)
entry
into
the
service
of
a
foreign
government
more
particularly
enrolment
in
the
armed
forces
of
a
foreign
country,
a
penalty.
now,
it
is
argued,
however,
that
this
case
comes
within
perez
because
this
is
not
a
penalty.
statelessness,
perpetual
risk
of
deportation,
indefinite
detention,
this
is
not
a
penalty.
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
quite
apart
from
the
purpose
served
by
349
(a)
(3),
the
mere
imposition
of
such
a
condition
is
a
penalty.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
where
it
results
in
statelessness
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
where
it
results
in
statelessness,
yes,
your
honor.
i
say
that
that
is
very
much
like
the
hard
labor
case
and
the
wong
wing
case
in
this
court.
in
wong
wing,
you
had
a
statute
which
provided
that
persons
unlawfully
in
this
country
could
be
arrested,
detained
and
subjected
to
hard
labor.
this
court
sustained
the
arrest,
sustained
the
detention,
but
said
that
hard
labor
was
an
infamous
punishment
which
could
be
imposed
on
--
upon
an
alien
only
after
a
judicial
trial.
i
cannot
see
how
the
performance
of
hard
labor
is
anymore
of
a
punishment
as
this
court
squarely
held
in
wong
wing,
in
the
condition
in
that
which
marks
finds
himself
today.
it
makes
no
difference
that
this
serves
any
of
the
functions
of
the
foreign
affairs
of
this
government.
the
assassination
of
a
citizen
embarrassing
us
would
solve
the
problem
too.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
i
think
it
has
come
time
to
talk
of
many
things
including
perez.
if
i
correctly
understand
the
ruling
in
perez,
it
is
that
the
foundation
for
this
type
of
expatriating
legislation
can
be
found
in
the
foreign
affairs
powers
of
the
congress.
and
basically,
what
i
understand
from
perez
is
that
where
individual
conduct
has
the
effect
of
potentially
involving
the
united
states
in
some
embroilment
or
embarrassment
with
foreign
countries,
that
in
those
circumstances,
there
is
the
power
to
denationalize.
according
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
problem
is
terminated
by
terminating
the
citizenship.
now,
whatever
such
justification
could
have
been
found
in
the
factual
situation
in
perez,
it
is
not
present
here.
i
see
only
two
possible
bases
for
the
exercise
of
the
foreign
affairs
powers
in
this
legislation.
the
first
is
in
those
instances
where
an
american
serves
in
a
foreign
army
and
then
invokes
american
intervention
to
get
him
out.
now
of
course,
that's
not
the
problem
in
these
cases.
because
in
nishikawa,
he
was
conscripted,
in
the
first
place
he's
denationalized.
consequently,
this
particular
function
can
exist
only
where
the
man
has
voluntarily
entered
the
foreign
military
service.
and
in
those
circumstances,
the
potential
that
he
may
after
voluntarily
entering
the
foreign
military
service
invoke
american
assistance
to
get
him
out,
i
think
is
minimal.
the
second
and
the
more
substantial
problem
derives
from
the
proposition
that
if
american
engages
in
military
service
on
behalf
of
a
foreign
government,
his
individual
action
may
be
associated
with
the
foreign
policy
of
this
nation
that
we
will
in
some
matter
of
fashion,
be
identified
with
the
aspirations,
with
the
motivations
of
the
particular
individual.
now,
this
i
think
to
be,
wholly
at
odds
with
the
legislative
history
here.
i
challenge
my
friend
to
point
to
a
one
word
in
any
of
the
debates,
any
of
the
reports,
anything
in
the
history
of
disarray
of
the
comparable
legislation,
to
indicate
that
the
congress
had
any
concern
for
that
problem,
whatsoever.
there
is
none.
and
that's
not
an
oversight.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
congress
found
that
the
problem
had
been
solved
by
other
means.
and
what
do
i
mean
by
that?
historically,
we
have
taken
the
position
that
when
a
man
serves
in
the
foreign
military
force,
we
disclaim
any
diplomatic
responsibility
for
him.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
no
question,
your
honor.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
no
question,
no
question.
but
more
simply
than
that
your
honor,
what
we
have
done
in
the
past
and
the
reason
why
i
submit
that
congress
has
not
acted
further
on
this
subject
is
that
when
an
american
is
on
a
foreign
military
service,
the
problem
is
solved
simply
by
saying,
"we'll
assume
no
diplomatic
responsibility
for
him.
we
disclaim
any
identification
with
the
policy"
and
that's
how
we've
solved
the
problem.
that's
why
congress
never
referred
itself
to
that
problem
in
the
enactment
of
section
349
(a)
(3).
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
because
of
the
availability
of
this
technique
which
is
proven
so
successful
historically,
i
think,
the
only
fair
thing
to
say
is
that
when
the
congress
undertakes
the
use
of
cannon
to
demolish
a
mosquito,
you
have
to
suspect
that
they're
really
after
the
wall
on
which
the
mosquito
has
lodged.
what
has
really
happened
here
is
that
the
disparity
between
the
alleged
problem,
to
which
congress
never
addressed
itself,
as
distinct
would
may
have
been
the
case
in
perez,
that
this
so-called
foreign
affairs
problem
just
never
existed.
and
if
it
did,
and
if
that
congress
undertook
to
treat
it
by
these
means,
liquidating
a
man's
nationality
if
not
his
personality,
then
we
would
have
to
say
that
to
use
such
gross
means,
to
mean
such
a
municipal
problem,
is
characteristic
of
penal
legislation
once
again.
now,
i
had
hoped
your
honor
to
treat
the
question
of
deportability
of
marks
even
assuming
him
to
be
an
alien.
i
would
ask
your
honors'
permission
to
file
a
replied
brief
to
treat
that
subject
more
fully
since
my
time
is
close
to
expiration.
interesting
as
i
think
that
problem
is.
may
i
have
the
court's
permission
to
file
a
report?
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
fine,
thank
you,
your
honor.
now,
i
would
like
to
conclude
by
making
one
point
clear
your
honor.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
asked
in
effect,
whether
my
position
in
this
case
is
necessarily
incompatible
with
the
decision
in
perez.
i
think
there
are
points
of
distinction
i
have
argued
them.
but
i
will
say
at
all
candid,
that
i
am
before
this
court
because
i
devoutly
believe
that
the
chief
justice's
position
in
the
perez
case
is
the
only
correct
one
compatible
with
this
society
at
least.
i
understand
that
position
ultimately
to
mean
that
to
its
expatriates
someone
for
non-renunciatory
action,
action
which
doesn't
renounce
american
allegiance,
jeopardizes
the
basis
of
a
democratic
society.
now,
that's
a
large
statement.
we
don't
make
such
statements
generally
these
days.
but
i'm
firmly
convinced
of
it
because
i
believe
that
in
a
democracy,
a
part
from
a
naturalization
powers,
it
is
the
citizenry
who
chooses
the
government
and
not
the
government
who
chooses
the
citizenry.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
stand
unique
among
the
great
democracies
of
the
world
in
this
type
of
legislation.
i've
studied
the
nationality
acts
of
all
the
countries
cited
at
page
60
of
my
opponent's
brief.
and
i
say
to
this
court
that
with
the
exception
of
such
countries
--
not
such,
with
exception
of
afghanistan,
austria,
cuba,
indonesia,
panama
and
turkey,
with
the
exception
of
those
countries,
there
is
not
another
country
in
the
world
which
denationalizes
under
the
circumstances
which
are
present
here.
in
many,
when
there
is
foreign
military
service,
the
government
notifies
the
individual
that
if
he
persists
in
the
foreign
military
service,
he
would
be
deprived
of
his
citizenship
and
he
has
given
a
choice
whether
he's
to
keep
his
citizenship
or
continue
in
that
service.
with
the
exception
of
the
countries
i
have
noted,
none
others
make
denationalization
automatic.
i
ask
for
a
reversal
if
the
court
please.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
deportation
case
in
which
the
principal
issue
was
whether
the
individual
involved,
mr.
marks,
had
lost
his
american
citizenship.
that
too
is
the
chief
issue
in
these
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
in
1958,
marks
went
to
cuba
and
joined
the
--
the
castro
forces
seeking
to
overthrow
batista.
he
served
in
the
rebel
army
of
castro
and
was
wounded
late
back
here
and
went
back
to
the
united
states
for
medical
treatment.
castro
was
victorious
that
took
over
power
in
cuba
on
january
1,
1959.
within
a
few
days,
petitioner
returned
to
cuba,
rejoined
the
rebel
army
which
now
is
the
dominant
military
force
in
cuba,
was
restored
to
his
rank
of
captain
and
was
assigned
important
security
responsibilities,
chief
of
which
was
the
execution
of
war
criminals,
so-called,
war
criminals,
who
were
condemned
by
military
courts.
he
achieved
considerable
notorieties
throughout
the
world
as
castro's
executioner.
in
february
1960,
he
was
served
with
a
notice
by
the
department
of
state
in
cuba
that
he
had
lost
his
american
citizenship
by
service
in
cuba's
army.
he
continued
to
serve
in
the
cuban
rebel
army
until
may
1960
when
he
deserted,
left
cuba
and
eventually
through
mexico,
came
back
to
the
united
states.
he
reentered
to
the
united
states
on
july
22nd,
1960
at
el
paso,
texas
then
claiming
to
be
an
american
citizen.
now
in
december
1960,
an
article
by
petitioner
appeared
in
a
magazine
known
as
cavalier
magazine.
the
title
of
the
article
was,
"i
was
castro's
killer."
and
within
the
month,
immigration
officers
being
apprised
apparently
that
he
was
in
this
country,
called
it
his
home,
questioned
him
and
then
the
questioning
was
continued
at
immigration
headquarters
to
which
he
voluntarily
went.
upon
the
conclusion
of
the
questioning,
the
immigration
officers
placed
him
under
arrest
and
commenced
deportation
proceedings
against
him.
extensive
hearings
were
conducted
on
nine
separate
days
over
a
period
of
a
couple
of
months.
petitioner
was
represented
by
counsel.after
the
hearings
were
completed,
a
deportation
order
was
entered
against
him
by
the
special
inquiry
officer.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
affirmed.during
the
pendency
of
the
deportation
proceedings,
petitioner
brought
habeas
corpus
proceedings
challenging
his
detention.
that
habeas
corpus
writ
was
heard
before
district
judge
levet.
judge
levet
ruled
that
the
challenge
to
the
merits
was
premature
and
that
the
insofar
as
the
detention
by
the
immigration
officers
was
concerned,
the
record
demonstrated
that
the
detention
was
based
on
adequate
ground.
therefore,
he
dismissed
writ
of
habeas
--
habeas
corpus.
when
the
deportation
hearings
were
completed
and
the
order
became
final
through
the
action
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
petitioner
started
a
new
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
this
was
heard
before
district
judge
cashin.
now
at
the
hearing
before
judge
cashin,
both
parties
stipulated
that
the
record
of
the
proceedings
before
the
special
inquiry
officer
was
to
be
received
an
evidence
and
considered
de
novo
by
the
trial
court.
this
was
done.
the
trial
court
considered
the
evidence
de
novo
and
after
his
consideration,
judge
cashin
ruled
that
the
petitioner
lost
his
citizenship
whose
service
in
the
military
forces
of
cuba
but
the
statute
was
constitutional
and
as
the
discussion
is
developed,
the
judge
ruled
further
that
petitioner
was
not
deportable.
because
at
the
time
he
entered
the
united
states
in
july
1960,
according
to
the
court
he
had
not
yet
lost
his
citizenship
because
he
could
lose
only
if
a
court
determine
that
he
had
lost
citizenship.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
that
is
right
sir.
it
would
have
found
him
to
be
a
citizen
only
as
of
the
time
that
a
court
determined
to
--
him
to
be
a
citizen.
since
was
not
an
alien
according
to
the
court,
he
would
continue
to
remain
here.
he
had
not
committed
any
act
which
would
have
made
him
deport.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
agreed
with
judge
cashin
that
expatriation
had
occurred
and
that
the
statute
was
constitutional.
it
disagreed
with
him
on
the
question
of
whether
the
petitioner
was
deportable
and
found
that
expatriation
had
occurred
automatically
when
the
act
of
expatriation
had
been
committed.
now,
the
court
sustained
the
deportation
order
on
a
single
ground,
the
ground
that
when
petitioner
entered
the
united
states
in
july
of
1960,
he
was
an
alien
as
the
court
found.
he
did
not
comply
with
the
documentary
requirements
which
are
prescribed
for
all
aliens
seeking
(inaudible)
of
the
united
states.
therefore,
he
had
entered
illegally
and
was
subject
to
deportation.
now,
my
opponent
has
not
dwelt
too
much
on
petitioner's
military
service
and
i
think,
in
order
to
inform
the
court,
i
--
i
just
would
like
to
spend
a
few
of
my
precious
moments
in
discussing
the
nature
of
this
military
service.
it
is
not
disputed
that
petitioner,
if
you're
involved
a
relevant
times
from
january
of
1959
through
may
of
1960,
served
as
a
captain
in
the
rebel
army
of
cuba,
which
was
castro's
army
that
had
taken
over
control
of
the
country.
that
he
was
charged
with
the
important
military
duties,
that
he
received
pay
and
identification
card
as
a
captain
in
the
ray
--
in
the
rebel
army.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
no
relevance
sir.
he
was
not
in
the
service
in
the
armed
forces
of
a
foreign
state.
that
he
deals
only
with
service
in
the
armed
forces
of
the
foreign
country.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
this
was
the
name
of
the
army.
it
continued
to
be
called
the
rebel
army
but
the
revolution
had
succeeded.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
definitely,
called
the
rebel
army.
it
was
the
--
and
they
call
it
the
army
of
the
revolution
or
some
such
name
today.
it
is
the
army
of
cuba
for
this
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
within
a
week
after
castro
took
off.
it's
the
first
week
of
january
of
1959.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
just
about
the
time
we
don't
have
the
exact
date
when
he
went
back,
just
about
that
time.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
that
is
right
sir.
recognized
by
our
government
and
for
a
period
of
17
months,
he
served
in
the
recognized
and
dominant
military
force
of
cuba.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
i
--
i
don't
think
so
but
i
think
we'll
confront
with
that
problem.
it
was
the
dominant
military
force.
he
was
the
force
in
which
operated
the
military
establishments,
was
responsible
for
security
and
so
forth.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
one
of
the
purposes.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
your
honor
in
my
view,
this
is
a
judgment
for
congress
to
make.
there
maybe
many
things
that
are
embarrassing
to
the
united
states.
congress
has
selected
this
which
congress
has
deemed
embarrassing.
i
think
that
the
judgment
is
reasonable
as
i
show
--
show
when
i
get
to
that
point
of
the
argument
unless
you
want
to
discuss
it
now.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
it
could
be
embarrassing
in
both
instances.
i
think
that
congress
has
not
been
confronted
with
difficulties
in
the
other
cases
apparently
and
has
been
confronted
with
difficulties
in
this
type
of
cases.
now,
i
think
one
more
point
should
be
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
military
service,
and
i
think
probably
is
significant
in
connection
with
the
consideration
of
this
case.
petitioner
contends
that
his
military
service
was
involuntary
and
he
hasn't
found
time
to
discuss
that
today.
i
--
i
shall
take
a
few
moments
to
discuss
this.
i
think
the
record
the
--
demonstrates
overwhelmingly
that
this
was
voluntary
military
service.
when
petitioner
went
back
he
says,
"i
went
back
for
a
reunion.
i
had
no
intention
of
serving
the
military
forces."
che
guevara,
the
big
man
in
cuba
said,
"you
take
over
as
captain,
shoot
these
people
who
condemned
by
the
military
court."
he
sounds
afraid
to
refuse.
now,
the
district
court
characterized
this
story
as
incredible
as
absurd
as
frivolous
and
i
think
those
conclusions
are
abundantly
demonstrated
by
the
record.
now,
petitioner
has
a
number
of
pre-hearing
documents
which
are
attributed
--
attributable
to
him
and
which
are
in
records.
these
are
the
interview
with
the
havana
times
in
february
1960,
the
cavalier
magazine
article
which
appeared
under
his
name
in
december
1960
and
the
statement
he
made
to
immigration
officers
in
january
1961.
not
the
slightest
suggestion
of
coercion
appears
in
any
of
these
pre-hearing
documents.
indeed,
the
first
time
there
was
any
mention
of
coercion
was
when
petitioner
appeared
for
his
hearing.
now,
the
cavalier
magazine
article
i
think
is
quite
significant
and
i'd
like
to
take
a
moment
to
read
what
he
said,
one
passage
in
this
article
about
his
service.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
yes,
he
admits
and
he
certifies
that
it's
true.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
no,
no,
he
didn't
write
it
sir.
it
was
written
for
him.
he
adopts
it
and
--
and
certifies
that
is
true.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
page
316
(b)
of
the
record.
here's
what
he
says,
for
five
months
in
havana
while
he
was
serving
as
castro's
executioner,
"for
five
months
in
havana,
i
had
no
difficulties
and
the
world
looked
pretty
bright.
i
was
content
in
my
work
and
left
pretty
much
alone."
now,
this
is
not
the
picture
of
a
man
who
is
serving
involuntarily.
this
is
the
man
who
is
--
whose
world
is
very
bright.
he's
happy
in
his
work.
he's
doing
exactly
what
he
wants
to
do.
i
want
to
point
out
further
that
the
fact
of
--
that
his
service
was
voluntary
had
showed
moreover
by
the
nature
of
this
service.
in
the
cavalier
magazine
article,
he
justifies
the
executions.
he
says,
"castro
was
justified
in
killing
off
these
people
because
they
would
of
course,
the
most,
start
the
trouble."
moreover,
we
have
the
testimony
of
a
witness
named
(inaudible)
who
was
the
public
defender
in
cuba
and
was
charged
with
defense
of
those
who
were
condemned
or
accused
in
the
military
court.
(inaudible)
says
he
saw
petitioner
at
la
cabana
military
fortress
where
he
was
the
security
officer.
everyday,
for
a
period
of
months,
dressed
in
his
uniform
and
insignia
of
a
captain
in
the
rebel
army,
he
saw
him
commanding
the
firing
squads.
he
saw
him
finishing
off
the
prisoners
after
the
firing
squads
were
--
were
finished.
he
--
(inaudible)
testified
that
petitioner
mocked
and
terrorized
the
prisoners
who
called
him
the
death
bird.
he
testifies
that
on
one
occasion
when
the
firing
squad
refused
to
execute
a
major
capote,
petitioner
himself
picked
up
a
machinegun
and
killed
not
only
capote
but
seven
of
the
people
who
were
then
awaiting
execution.
this
is
not
the
conduct
of
a
person
who
is
serving
involuntarily.
it
is
the
person
of
a
--
of
a
--
it
is
the
service
of
a
person
who
as
he
says,
whose
world
look
bright,
who
was
very
happy
in
his
work.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
he
--
he
says
he
deserted
because
the
--
the
government
was
after
him.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
i
don't
accept
it
sir.
this
is
the
only
statement
in
the
record,
but
this
is
what
he
says.
he
says,
"i
was
anti-communist."
he
stayed
for
a
period
of
17
months.
he
didn't
make
any
effort
to
desert
him
at
that
time.
travel
between
the
unites
states
and
cuba
was
relatively
free
at
that
time.
other
people
are
going
on
vacation
trips,
yet
petitioner
stayed
for
17
months.
and
when
he
deserted,
he
said
the
reason
for
my
desertion
is
because
people
were
after
me
not
because
my
service
was
involuntary
because
i
had
fallen
into
this
favor.
or
i
submit
that
this
claim
of
involuntariness
is
in
the
language
of
the
district
court
absurd,
frivolous
and
unbelievable.
now,
i
--
i
want
to
get
to
one
point
before
i
--
i
deal
with
the
constitutional
issues
and
that's
been
suggested
in
the
argument
of
the
petitioner.
the
claim
is
made
that
this
statute
in
order
to
avoid
constitutional
difficulties
should
be
construed
as
--
so
as
to
require
a
positive
--
a
positive
intent
to
give
up
citizenship.
now
of
course,
such
a
claim
cannot
be
based
on
the
statute
itself.
as
i
read
the
statute,
i
believe
this
is
a
reasonable
and
inescapable
reading.
the
statute
definitely
contemplates
that
overt
actions
prescribed
in
the
statute
shall
cause
loss
of
citizenship.
thus
the
introductory
language
of
section
349
(a)
(3),
the
general
statute
dealing
with
expatriation
says,
"a
person
who
performs
one
of
the
following
specified
actions
shall
lose
his
nationality."
now,
section
349
(a)
(3)
in
the
construction
which
the
petitioner
suggests
would
depend
on
the
unlikely
contingency
that
the
person
involved
would
say,
"i
did
intend
to
give
up
citizenship."
there
isn't
anything
in
that
statute
to
justify.
and
if
that
construction
is
accepted,
it
would
in
effect
nullify
the
other
statutory
provisions
dealing
with
the
subject,
dealing
with
voting,
with
naturalization
in
the
foreign
state,
with
taking
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
a
foreign
state,
with
residence
in
a
foreign
state,
with
taking
a
--
an
office
or
employment
in
the
employee
of
a
foreign
state.
when
congress
wished
to
prescribe
a
--
an
affirmative
intent,
congress
had
no
difficulty
in
doing
this
as
in
the
provisions
for
renunciation.
congress
said
that
if
a
person
wants
to
renounce
citizenship
voluntarily,
that's
a
way
for
him
to
do
it.
it
failed
to
do
that
in
349
(a)
(3)
and
it
seems
to
me,
it
was
up
to
be
--
obviously
not
intended.
moreover,
of
course
if,
the
construction
that
petitioner
suggest
is
adopted,
there
wouldn't
be
any
need
for
349
(a)
(3).
a
person
who
wished
to
renounce
citizenship
could
do
so
under
349
(a)
(6),
under
the
specific
provisions
for
renunciation.
now,
petitioner
cites
no
cases
to
support
this
possible
construction.
and
of
course,
it
is
directly
opposed
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
mackenzie
against
hare,
in
savorgnan
against
the
united
states,
in
perez
against
brownell.
each
of
those
cases
and
each
of
them,
the
citizen
said,
"i
had
no
desire
to
cast
off
citizenship."
yet
in
each
case,
this
court
held
that
citizenship,
the
loss
of
citizenship
depends
not
on
the
individual's
objective
intended,
but
rather
on
the
voluntary
performance
of
certain
actions
which
congress
designates
as
ground
for
expatriation.
now,
i
believe
it's
not
possible
to
construe
this
statute
in
the
way
which
petitioner
suggest.
and
therefore,
we
come
to
the
question
of
whether
congress
had
power
to
prescribe
such
consequence.
now,
i
think
the
main
thrust
of
petitioner's
argument
is
his
contention
that
this
statute
is
penal
in
its
form
and
purpose
and
its
application.
from
this
claim,
he
next
proceed
to
another
step.
he
says,
"since
i
find
that
this
statute
is
punitive
then,
it
is
subject
to
the
eighth
amendment's
bar
against
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
and
also
subject
to
the
procedural
restrictions
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments."
none
of
the
legislative
materials
cited
in
petitioner's
brief
and
none
of
the
materials
that
we've
been
able
to
find
has
even
the
slightest
suggestion
of
any
punitive
aim
on
the
part
of
congress.
indeed,
the
legislative
materials
and
we
cite
them
in
our
brief
at
pages
44
and
45.
the
legislative
materials
show
that
congress
was
concerned
with
a
condition
which
--
which
prejudiced
our
foreign
relations
and
that
congress
wished
to
regulate
these
conditions.
the
aim
of
the
legislation
insofar
as
the
legislative
report
is
concerned,
reveals
no
suggestion
of
--
of
punishment.
it
merely
shows
that
congress
intended
to
regulate.
just
one
--
one
word
from
the
committee
report
on
the
1940
act,
in
those
reports,
the
cabinet
committee
which
drafted
that
statute,
had
this
to
say
about
the
foreign
military
service.
they
said
that
an
american
who
served
in
the
military
forces
of
a
foreign
army
and
thereby
offered
his
all
in
support
of
that
stage,
should
be
deemed
to
have
transferred
his
allegiance
to
it.
mr.
richard
foronjy
whose
testimony,
my
colleague
has
quoted,
expressed
substantially
the
same
foot
in
his
testimony.
now,
there's
nothing
to
suggest
the
punitive
aim
in
any
of
these
materials.
there's
nothing
to
suggest
a
punitive
aim
in
the
statute
itself.
and
i
suggest
that
in
the
absence
of
this
indicia
of
punishment,
it
isn't
possible
to
ascribe
to
congress
a
motive
to
punish.
as
this
court
said
in
the
nestor
case,
fleming
against
nestor,
punishment
can
be
found
only
upon
the
clearest
showing
that
punishment
was
intended.
now,
petitioner
goes
on
and
relies
on
the
decision
of
this
court
in
mendoza-martinez
and
the
plurality
opinion
in
trop
against
dulles.
i
suggest
that
petitioner
misconceives
those
decisions
and
opinions.
mendoza-martinez
involved,
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
pointed
out
earlier,
involved
evasion
of
selective
service
obligations
under
a
statute
which,
upon
examination
of
an
extensive
leg
--
legislative
history
was
found
to
intend
punishment
for
the
crime
of
draft
avoidance.
now,
trop
similarly
found
on
the
basis
of
the
statute
itself
and
also
an
extensive
examination
of
the
legislative
history,
that's
the
statute
--
i
believe
the
language
of
the
chief
justice
was
that
the
evident
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
impose
an
additional
punishment
for
the
crime
of
desertion.
and
the
chief
justice
went
on
to
say,
"there
is
no
other
possible
purpose
that
this
statute
can
be
taken
to
serve."
now,
this
statute
has
no
punitive
overtones.
there
was
no
showing
that
punishment
was
intended
and
therefore,
these
decisions
have
no
relevance.
petitioner's
major
thesis
is
that
because
the
statute
results
in
statelessness,
then
it
must
necessarily
be
punitive
and
therefore,
it
must
subject
him
to
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
now,
i
think
in
making
this
argument,
the
petitioner
again
misunderstands
the
plurality
opinion
in
trop
against
dulles.
the
chief
justice
there
found,
first,
on
the
basis
of
this
extensive
review
of
the
legislative
history
that
the
statute
imposed
punishment.
then
the
chief
justice
went
on
to
say
that,
"such
punishment
resulting
in
statelessness
was
cruel
and
unusual."
here,
there's
no
punishment
of
any
kind.
therefore,
the
question
of
whether
the
punishment
is
cruel
and
unusual
cannot
come
into
play.
but
the
argument
that
statelessness
necessarily
entails
punishment,
in
my
view,
cannot
be
supported.
unless,
for
example,
a
person
can
become
stateless
in
many
ways,
through
his
own
voluntary
choice,
he
can
renounce
his
citizenship
and
become
stateless.
does
that
punish
him?
he
can
take
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
a
foreign
government
and
become
stateless.
i
believe
that
--
that
the
fact
that
the
person
is
stateless
is
not
an
evidence
of
punishment.
this
is
a
consequence
which
an
individual
has
suffered
as
a
result
of
his
voluntary
action.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
his
argument
sir
is
that
the
condition
of
statelessness
which
results
from
a
statute
necessarily
is
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
if
the
statute
imposes
no
punishment,
i
submit,
there
is
no
issue
as
to
whether
the
government
nor
he
imposed
it.
if
it
--
the
argument
depends
on
whether
statelessness
--
alone
results
in
punishment,
i
say
that
this
can't
be
sustained.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
in
other
words,
the
argument
would
--
would
lead
us
to
the
result
that
all
expatriation
without
the
consent
of
the
individual
is
punishment.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
your
honor,
i
--
i
--
i
must
disagree.
i
think
punishment
can't
be
found
because
an
individual
is
unhappy
with
certain
consequences.
punishment
depends
on
certain
criteria
which
this
court
has
spelled
out
and
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
said
his
opinion
in
mendoza-martinez
and
it
isn't
very
often
--
often
isn't
very
easy
to
isolate
what
was
behind
the
decision.
but
the
primary
consideration
which
must
exist
is
that
congress
intended
to
punish
and
here,
there's
no
such
showing.
there
must
be
the
clearest
showing
that
congress
intended
to
impose
a
punishment.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
that'd
be
another
story
sir.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
that
be
a
punishment
--
that
be
--
because
it's
myself,
perhaps
what
will
be
another
story
because
congress
is
imposing
a
consequence
as
we
--
a
punishment
for
certain
specific
conduct.
this
is
not
punishment
for
any
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
no,
this
is
--
this
is
a
--
a
whole
field
of
activity,
not
this
individual's
conduct.
his
conduct
is
not
what
is
involved.
it
is
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
the
congress
didn't
take
into
account
the
specific
facts
as
to
what
mr.
marks
did.
they
took
into
account
the
entire
policy
for
question
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
what
he
himself
did.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
not
what
he
--
he
wasn't
being
punished
for
anything
himself.
he
was
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
congress
did
not
direct
any
statute
against
him
your
honor.
congress
dealt
with
a
problem,
a
problem
which
concerns
hundreds
and
thousands
of
people.
the
problem
is
whether
these
individuals
by
their
activities
in
a
foreign
state,
can
subject
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
embroilments
and
embarrassments.
it
wasn't
seeking
to
punish
these
people.
it
was
seeking
to
cope
with
the
problem
which
endangered
the
united
states.
now,
one
further
word
on
the
question
of
the
severity
of
the
consequence
was
he
--
argues
the
argument
has
made
and
because
this
is
of
a
severe
consequence,
it
must
be
punishment.
now,
under
our
laws,
people
are
citizens
and
aliens,
unsubjected
to
many
severe
consequences.
these
include
of
course,
deportation,
denaturalization,
the
uses
--
limitation
on
the
use
and
enjoinment
of
property,
liability
to
selective
service
obligations.
none
of
these
is
deemed
punishment
at
least
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
in
the
constitutional
sense
unless
there
is
a
specific
legislative
design
to
punish.
now,
i'd
submit
that
the
--
the
statute,
section
349
(a)
(3),
cannot
be
demolished
on
petitioner's
unsupported
assertion
that
the
statute
was
punitive.
and
i
want
to
borrow
again
from
the
language
of
the
chief
justice,
chief
justice
said
in
his
plurality
opinion
in
trop,
"a
statute
cannot
be
interpreted
by
pasting
a
label
on
it,"
i
think
that's
a
very
felicitous
phrase
and
i
think
it
applies
here.
this
statute
cannot
be
denounced
by
merely
taking
a
label
and
putting
on
a
statute
and
say,
"this
is
punishment.
there
has
to
be
some
glue
to
make
it
stick."
and
the
glue
consists
of
a
showing.
the
clearest
showing
in
the
language
of
nestor
that
punishment
was
intended.
only
in
that
way
can
this
statute
be
characterized
as
punitive.
now,
i
want
to
get
to
the
question,
in
my
mind
the
only
question
on
constitutionality
and
that
is
whether
this
statute
fulfills
a
legislative
purpose
where
that
reasonably
effectuates
a
power
of
congress.
to
me,
this
is
the
only
issue
in
the
case
on
the
question
of
constitutionality.
now
here,
the
controlling
principles
are
enunciated
in
this
court's
decision
in
perez.
perez
found
it
proper
for
congress
to
prescribe
expatriation
for
the
involvement
by
an
american
citizen
in
the
political
affairs
of
a
foreign
state,
their
voting
and
underlying
that
decision,
were
two
basic
premises.
the
first
of
these
is
that
it
was
proper
for
congress
to
deal
with
such
conduct,
which
potentially
or
actually
could
involve
this
government
in
embroilments
and
embarrassments
in
its
relations
with
foreign
governments.
and
the
second
consideration
was
that
it
was
not
unreasonable
for
congress
to
deem
that
the
citizens'
participation
in
the
political
affairs
of
a
foreign
nation
was
to
some
extent,
an
indication
of
his
attachment
to
the
foreign
nation
and
to
some
extent,
inconsistent
with
allegiance
to
the
united
states.
now,
i
submit
that
both
of
these
considerations
are
present
here
and
that
their
impact
is
even
more
potent
than
in
perez.
military
service
is
a
more
positive
act
of
commitment
to
a
foreign
state,
more
positive
involvement
in
the
affairs
of
a
foreign
state
than
voting.
it
may
conflict
with
national
policies
of
neutrality
as
it
has
in
the
past.
it
may
lead
this
nation
down
the
road
of
danger
and
embarrassment
which
can't
be
perilous
to
this
country
and
to
its
citizens.
and
the
second
consideration
mentioned
in
perez,
the
possibility
of
impaired
allegiance
is,
i
believe,
equally
present
here.
for
military
service,
the
person
who
serves
in
the
army
of
a
foreign
state
has
committed
himself
to
that
state,
has
subjected
himself
to
the
mandates
and
the
orders
of
that
state
to
a
degree
which
indicates
some
commitment
to
that
state
and
some
degree
of
lessened
allegiance
to
the
united
states.
in
any
event,
using
the
criterion
of
perez,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
reasonable
for
congress
to
conclude
that
these
events
could
occur
and
did
occur.
now,
the
statute
section
349
(a)
(3)
thus,
on
its
face,
seems
to
represent
a
reasonable
effort
to
deal
with
the
twin
problems
of
embroilments,
passive
embroilments
and
impaired
allegiance.
now,
we
are
at
left
the
conjecture
about
this
because
the
legislative
history
demonstrates
a
very
sharp
awareness
on
the
part
of
congress
to
these
problems
and
a
desire
to
deal
with
them.
we
deal
with
the
legislative
history
extensively
at
pages
54
to
58
of
our
brief.
now,
i
want
to
summarize
it
very
briefly.
military
service
by
american
citizens
and
the
armed
forces
of
foreign
nation
--
foreign
nations,
has
been
a
matter
of
deep
concern
to
this
nation
from
its
very
inception.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
earliest
supreme
court
cases
talked
of
the
possibility
of
such
embarrassment
to
our
nation.
in
the
three
basic
statutes
in
this
field,
dealing
with
expatriations,
those
of
1907,
1940
and
1952,
congress
showed
its
awareness
with
these
problems.
now
in
the
1907
statute,
the
committee,
the
administrative
committee
and
the
state
department
which
granted
that
statute,
spoke
of
the
actions
of
citizens
in
foreign
states
which
were
causing
increasing
embarrassment
to
our
government.
in
the
1940
nationality
act,
the
cabinet
committee
which
drafted
that
statute
spoke
of
the
desire
on
the
part
of
that
committee
to
deal
with
such
problems.
and
then
specifically,
in
relation
to
military
service,
the
committee
pointed
out
that
in
their
view,
a
person
as
i
quoted
before,
a
person
who
gives
his
all,
offers
his
all
to
a
country
thereby
should
be
deemed
to
have
shown
some
allegiance
to
their
country.
and
then
in
1952,
congress,
when
they
re-codified
the
statutes
through
the
judiciary
--
senate
judiciary
committee
which
was
responsible
for
the
1952
act,
congress
said
that,
"we're
revising
this
law
so
that
the
determination
of
whether
a
person
loses
nationality
shall
not
depend
upon
the
determination
of
a
foreign
government
and
shall
be
uniformed."
moreover,
the
committee
and
congress
in
turn
which
adopted
the
committee's
recommendations,
recognize
the
close
identity
between
military
service
and
the
conduct
of
foreign
affairs
by
the
provision
which
is
now
found
in
section
349
(a)
(3)
that
such
service
would
expatiate
unless
it
was
approved
in
writing
by
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
secretary
of
defense.
the
officers
charged
primarily
with
activities
in
the
field,
a
foreign
relation.
the
legislative
design
to
tie
this
power
to
expatriate
to
the
conduct
of
foreign
affairs
thus
emerges
quietly
clearly.
the
only
remaining
question
is
whether
the
means
chosen
to
effectuate
that
policy
are
reasonable.
this
is
the
rational
nexus
concept
of
perez
or
the
reasonable
relationship,
and
other
--
other
language
has
been
used.
whether
there's
a
rational
nexus
between
the
--
the
means
--
the
--
the
end
that
congress
sought
to
achieve
and
the
means
that
if
you
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
a
connection,
whether
having
in
mind
a
particular
power,
whether
the
means
chosen
has
a
reasonable
relationship
or
a
relevant
connection
as
others
have
said
in
executing
that
power.
now,
the
same
issue
of
course
was
confronted
in
perez
against
brownell.
and
there,
the
court
said
that
it
is
the
citizenship
of
the
individual
which
causes
the
difficulty,
the
fact
that
the
citizen
is
involved
in
political
activities
in
foreign
countries,
the
fact
that
he's
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
is
what
causes
the
difficulty.
and
the
court
said,
"the
termination
of
the
citizenship
terminates
the
problem."
now,
the
same
thought
is
expressed
by
mr.
justice
brennan's
concurring
opinion
in
trop
against
dulles
and
i
quote,
it's
at
page
59
of
our
brief.
mr.
justice
brennan
said,
"congress
might
reasonably
believe
--
believe
that
in
these
circumstances,
there
is
no
acceptable
alternative
to
expatriation
as
a
means
of
avoiding
possible
embarrassments
to
our
relations
with
foreign
countries."
now,
these
considerations
obviously
are
relevant
here.
since
the
military
service
by
an
american
in
the
army
of
a
foreign
country,
has
in
it,
the
potentiality
of
involving
our
country
in
embarrassments,
in
embroilments
and
his
citizenship
is
a
thing
that
causes
the
trouble.
in
the
language
of
perez,
the
termination
of
his
citizenship
terminates
the
problem.
and
in
the
language
of
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
was
reasonable
for
congress
to
conclude
that
there
is
no
acceptable
alternative
to
expatriation
as
a
means
of
dealing
with
this
problem
and
borrowing
further
from
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
mendoza-martinez.
congress
could
conclude
that
this
was
a
proper
device
for
--
to
cope
with
actions
which
could
dangerously
prejudice
our
diplo
--
diplomacy.
mr.
justice
brennan
quoted
a
uniquely
potent
corrector
for
such
actions.
now,
without
this
power,
congress
would
be
powerless
to
deal
with
actions
of
citizens
in
foreign
countries,
so
long
as
they
remained
in
foreign
countries,
the
actions
which
prejudiced
our
nation,
prejudiced
its
diplomacy,
involve
our
government
in
dangers
which
could
affect
every
citizen.
now,
petitioner
also
makes
one
argument
with
which
i'd
like
to
give.
he
says
that
section
349
(a)
(3)
is
not
confined
to
embarrassing
service.
it
could
reach
non-embarrassing
service
in
the
army
of
a
friendly
nation.
now
the
answer,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
perez,
is
that
in
dealing
with
a
problem
as
complex
and
as
vital
as
the
power
to
conduct
foreign
affairs,
congress
must
be
free
to
legislate
in
the
language
of
perez
on
more
than
an
ad
hoc
basis.
in
dealing
with
such
a
complex
power,
congress
should
have
the
authority,
the
scope
to
establish
reasonable
general
classifications
so
that
the
problem
can
--
can
be
dealt
with
as
it
arises.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
your
honor,
there's
nothing
specifically
in
the
constitution
as
your
honor
knows
that
says
congress
shall
have
the
power
to
deal
with
foreign
affairs.
however,
in
perez
and
mendoza
martinez,
the
court
said
that
this
is
under
the
necessary
and
proper
power.
indeed,
it
is
my
view
and
implied
our
government.
no
government
worth
its
name
could
exist
unless
it
had
power
to
conduct
relations
with
foreign
nations.
this
is
i
think,
one
--
probably
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
failure
of
the
articles
of
confederation
and
the
need
for
adopting
the
constitution.
part
of
the
business
of
governments,
of
any
government,
is
in
conducting
the
--
the
affairs
of
a
nation
with
other
nations.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
your
honor,
i
think
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
all
--
it
all
depends
on
how
effective
your
honor
conceives
the
power
to
conduct
foreign
affairs
to
be.
if
congress
is
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
that
--
that
is
--
that
is
true,
sir.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
i
didn't
say
that
sir.
i
said
that
in
conducting
the
power
to
deal
with
other
nations,
the
power
of
foreign
affairs,
congress
can
take
reasonable
action,
can
use
reasonable
devices
to
effectuate
that
power
and
the
device
to
terminate
the
citizenship
of
a
person
who
is
prejudicing
are
the
--
diplomacy
is
as
mr.
justice
brennan
said
a
uniquely
potent
corrective.
this
is
part
of
the
power
to
conduct
foreign
affairs.
if
there
weren't
power
to
expatriate
then
our
foreign
relations,
our
conduct
to
foreign
affairs
could
be
dangerously
prejudiced.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
your
honors,
i
--
i
said
earlier,
congress
can
determine
between
all
prejudices.
we
don't
have
to
deal
with
every
possible
situation.
congress
could
have
said,
"we
don't
deem
this
dangerous.
the
congress
or
the
legislature
parliament
of
great
britain
can
say
they
don't
deem
it
dangerous.
in
a
field
as
--
as
complex
as
this,
the
choice
of
alternatives
in
my
view
is
for
congress.
there
are
alternatives.
there
are
dangers.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
i
call
it
a
recognition
your
honor
rather
than
a
grant.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
then
i
don't
agree
with
that
either,
sir.
i
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
no,
i
think
that
everybody
who
was
born
in
united
states
prior
to
1868,
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
thereof,
as
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
the
constitution
recognizes
these
citizens.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
your
honor,
the
dred
scott
case
had
many
things.
this
was
a
very
lengthy
in
the
discourse
of
opinion.
and
some
of
the
things
that
were
said
in
that
case
which
didn't
have
any
relevance
to
the
case,
have
been
--
not
been
followed.
that
was
incorrect,
your
honor.
in
my
opinion,
the
power
of
--
of
the
government
to
recognize
citizenship
was
not
dependent
on
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
constitution
itself
said,
"only
certain
types
of
citizens
shall
be
eligible
for
precedent.
only
certain
types
of
citizens
shall
be
eligible
to
be
represented
in
the
senate."
there
were
citizens
before
the
eighth
--
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
has
chosen
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
i
don't
think
we
have
to
have
a
--
a
vote
among
other
the
nations
to
determine
what's
proper
in
our
foreign
policy.
we
determine
our
own
foreign
policy
with
other
nations
for
reasons
of
--
of
their
own,
maybe
the
reasons
of
empire
whatever
they
may
be.
beside,
they
don't'
want
to
exercise
such
power.
this
is
not
a
question
of
--
of
upholding
the
different
nations,
to
see
what
they
think
is
reasonable.
it's
a
question
of
whether
under
our
constitutional
form
of
government
and
under
the
--
the
views
adopted
by
our
congress,
such
a
power
is
reasonably
exercised.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
i
--
i
think
it's
all
a
question
of
reasonableness
your
honor.
is
--
is
it
--
yes,
this
--
the
determination
--
i'm
not
talking
about
the
specific
case
your
honor
imposes,
but
any
attempt
of
congress
to
exercise
this
power
has
to
be
judged
under
the
doctrine
of
perez
of
course,
on
the
basis
of
whether
under
the
circumstances
considered
by
congress,
it
would
be
reasonable
to
--
for
congress
to
determine
that
expatriation
is
the
only
acceptable
alternative
to
deal
with
this
problem.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
your
honor,
i
can
conceive
of
situations
where
congress
could
make
such
a
judgment.
the
people,
in
an
organized
body,
went
across
to
other
countries
and
attempt
to
promote
trouble
for
the
united
states,
i
think
congress
could
deal
with
those
problems
and
the
fact
that
they
were
making
speeches
wouldn't
be
the
decisive
criterion.
but
i
don't
think
we're
dealing
with
such
a
problem
here.
we're
dealing
with
an
act
which
on
its
face
can
cause
trouble
for
the
united
states,
which
on
its
face
has
caused
trouble
for
the
united
states.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
exercise
of
its
very
broad
power
to
conduct
foreign
affairs,
congress
reasonably
can
be
deal
with
such
a
problem.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
your
honor
the
--
the
statement
you
referred
to
--
from
our
brief
on
page
60,
says
that
there
many
other
countries,
a
total
of
16
that
deal
with
the
problem
of
military
service.
eight
of
those
countries
have
statues
which
are
quite
similar
to
section
349
(a)
(3).
now,
answering
your
specific
question,
your
honor,
as
i
said
in
relation
to
mr.
justice
goldberg's
question,
it
seems
to
me,
we're
not
conducting
a
poll
of
what
other
countries
do
here.
these
are
only
questions
of
interest.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
it
has
some
bearings
sir,
but
i
don't
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
i
--
i
hope
so.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
no,
i
--
i
agree
your
honor
that
it
some
bearing.
but
let
--
let
me
point
out
one
--
one
additional
thing.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon

--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
and
a
footnote,
sir.
page
60,
note
39.
is
it
39?
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
our
brief.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
you
may
have
the
wrong
brief
sir.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
please,
please
you
leave
--
we
have
enough
trouble
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
let
me
make
the
answer
that
i
start
to
make
--
when
you
get
page
60,
your
honor.
i
think
the
--
the
position
of
turkey
and
whatever
the
other
nations
are,
it's
not
the
position
of
the
united
states,
united
states
is
a
unique
power.
it's
a
will
power.
it
has
obligations
and
responsibilities
and
interests
and
policies
to
promote
throughout
the
world.
a
single
action
of
a
citizen
in
a
foreign
country
may
cause
difficulty
and
embarrassment
for
the
united
states
where
it
might
not
in
turkey.
a
person
who
goes
to
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
yes,
but
in
might
--
yes,
turkey.
let's
take
a
country
that
doesn't
have
the
law.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
great
britain,
as
--
as
mr.
justice
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well
to
me
--
to
me
this
is
not
decisive,
sir.
i
think
the
problems
of
the
united
state
are
unique
to
the
united
states.
it
can
be
dealt
with
by
our
congress
in
a
reasonable
way.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
and
one
more
thing
let
me
complete
my
thought.
united
states
i
said
has
a
unique
position.
a
single
action
of
its
citizen
could
dangerously
prejudice.
we
had
an
incident
like
that
sometime
ago,
a
young
lady
was
a
member
of
the
peace
corps
and
she
sent
a
postcard
to
some
friend
of
hers
and
because
of
his
postcard,
worldwide
embarrassment
resulted
to
the
united
states.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
your
honor,
this
is
not
the
type
of
embarrassment
which
i
had
in
mind.
but
i
--
i
was
merely
posing
it
as
an
example
of
what
the
united
states
is
confronted
with
in
managing
its
affairs
throughout
the
world.
now,
i
want
to
point
out
one
further
thing
this
question
of
embarrassment.
now,
it's
true
of
course
that
an
individual
case,
the
activities
of
a
citizen
may
not
be
embarrassing
to
the
united
states.
but
the
individual
citizen
in
my
opinion
cannot
be
permitted
to
make
this
judgment
for
our
country,
nor
can
a
foreign
nation
do
this
as
congress
said
in
the
1952
legislation.
the
statute
recognizes
the
possibility
that
there
will
be
cases
where
the
service
would
not
be
embarrassing,
and
it
deals
with
that
situation
by
expressly
permitting
approval
of
the
service
by
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
secretary
of
defense.
in
my
view,
this
places
the
responsibility
for
assessing
the
interest
of
the
united
states
where
it
belongs
in
the
foreign
affairs
agencies
of
our
government.
now,
in
couple
minutes
i
have
left,
i'd
like
to
deal
with
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
deportation
order
which
the
court
had
some
question
about.
this
case
originated
of
course,
as
a
deportation
case.
if
the
petitioner
loses
on
his
claim
that
he's
a
citizen,
then
will
have
to
determine
whether
the
deportation
order
is
valid
since
this
is
habeas
corpus.
a
deportation
is
premised
on
section
241
(a)
(1)
of
the
statute
which
provides
that
a
--
the
congress
can
--
that
the
attorney
general
can
deport
an
alien
who
entered
the
united
states
in
violation
of
law
--
in
violation
of
law
which
had
existed
at
the
time
of
his
entry.
the
court
of
appeals,
the
--
the
administrative
authorities
relied
on
two
grounds.
first,
that
petitioner
in
19
--
1960
--
july
1960,
when
he
entered
at
el
paso,
texas,
did
not
possess
the
requisite
document,
an
immigrant
visa,
he
was
an
alien,
he
didn't
have
an
immigrant
visa.
and
second,
that
prior
to
that
entry,
he
had
been
convicted
of
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
the
first
ground
and
found
it
unnecessary
to
writ
the
second.
we
think
both
grounds
are
supported,
however
like
the
court
of
appeals,
i
should
like
to
emphasize
the
first.
i
think
that
in
itself
is
a
valid
ground
for
the
deportation.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
no
sir,
no
court
had
held
that.
it
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
it
had
occurred
automatically
under
the
operation
of
the
statute.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
any
--
any
--
any
agency
or
any
court
with
whom
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
any
--
any
agency
who
had
to
determine
whether
a
person
was
a
citizen.
they
wouldn't
take
it
away
from
him.
in
the
exercise
of
their
authority,
they
had
to
determine
whether
the
individual
was
a
citizen.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
your
honor,
there's
no
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
there's
no
difficulty
in
getting
a
court
to
do
something.
that
person
in
that
situation
has
many
remedies,
if
he's
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
your
honor,
if
--
wanted
--
if
you
want
to
address
yourself
for
that
point,
i
think
we
can
--
we
can
say
something
about
it.
whether
the
--
the
first
issue
of
course,
would
be
whether
the
statute
itself
requires
the
court
to
do
this
and
i
think
that
is
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
that's
the
second
question.
first
question
is
whether
the
statute
requires
it.
and
i
think
that
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
there
is
no
such
requirement.
the
statute
provides
for
no
court
proceedings
or
administrative
proceedings.
it
determines
that
loss
of
nationality
shall
occur
upon
the
prescribed
events.
and
then
it
has
a
specific
provision,
section
356
which
is
set
forth
in
our
brief.
it's
a
very
brief
section.
it
says
that
loss
of
nationality
shall
--
shall
occur
upon
the
performance
--
the
loss
of
nationality
under
this
chapter
shall
result
solely
from
the
performance
by
a
national,
of
the
acts
or
fulfillment
of
the
condition
specified
in
the
chapter.
that's
page
62
of
our
brief.
now,
coming
to
the
question
of
power,
i
think
there's
no
question
that
congress
intended
that
these
laws
should
be
automatic,
coming
to
the
question
of
power.
is
there
power
on
the
part
of
congress
to
say
that
loss
of
nationality
shall
be
automatic
even
though
a
court
hasn't
determined?
well,
i
point
out,
sir,
that
every
decision
of
this
court
starting
from
the
very
earliest
days
of
our
republic,
has
either
held
or
recognized
that
loss
of
citizenship
when
it
did
occur,
occurred
automatically
upon
the
commission
or
the
performance
of
an
act
of
expatriation.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
no,
when
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
the
old
cases
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
there
weren't
any
--
any
provisions
in
the
statute
for
expatriation
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
1907,
that's
the
first
statute
which
--
which
prescribed
us
expatriation.
but
the
old
cases
dealt
with
the
problem
of
expatriation.
most
of
the
other
cases
were
people
who
shift
down
our
privateers
and
started
to
involve
themselves
in
military
expeditions.
the
question
was
whether
they'd
lost
their
citizenship.
now
in
each
of
those
cases,
the
court
found
that
because
of
the
circumstances,
citizenship
had
not
been
lost.
but
in
each
of
those
cases,
this
court
recognized
that
citizenship
could
have
been
lost
if
there
had
been
an
act
of
expatriation.
they
used
that
language.
the
modern
cases
of
course
were
even
more
specific.
perez
against
brownell,
depended
specifically
on
a
finding
that
the
virtue
of
the
expatriation
device,
the
value
of
it
in
implementing
the
foreign
affairs
function
resulted
chiefly
from
the
fact
that
it
operated
automatically.
mendoza-martinez,
the
court
found
their
language
is
very
explicit
that
the
expatriation
statute
and
i
quote
from
the
language
of
the
court,
"automatically,
without
prior
court
or
administrative
proceedings
imposed
forfeiture
of
citizenship."
now,
the
court
found
that
the
statute
in
that
case,
since
it
inflicted
punishment
required
under
the
procedural
guarantees
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment,
a
--
a
criminal
--
a
trial
in
the
nature
of
a
criminal
trail.
but
there's
no
punishment
here
and
there
--
therefore,
there
is
no
such
requirement
in
this
case.
now,
what
would
happen
if
there
was
such
a
requirement?
how
would
the
government
implement
its
foreign
affairs
function?
suppose
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
continued
to
be
in
a
foreign
country,
what
kind
of
an
act
--
what
kind
of
a
remedy
could
the
government
adopt
and
pursue
against
him?
actually,
i
know
of
no
such
remedy,
so
the
result
would
be
that
the
individual
whose
conduct
is
dangerous
to
the
united
states
could
continue
to
be
in
a
foreign
country
or
foreign
countries
and
to
pursue
conduct
which
is
dangerous
to
our
diplomacy,
perilous
to
our
nation
and
the
government
of
the
united
states
wouldn't
be
able
to
do
anything
about
it.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
but
expatriation
would
--
would
terminate
the
problem
in
the
language
of
perez.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
we're
dealing
--
we're
discussing
sir,
the
question
of
whether
congress
can
deal
with
the
problem
of
possible
embarrassment,
possible
involvement
of
the
united
states
in
international
difficulty.
and
the
only
way
congress
thought
this
could
be
done,
the
only
acceptable
alternative
to
use
the
language
of
mr.
justice
brennan,
was
to
impose
the
consequence
of
expatriation.
in
the
language
of
perez,
the
termination
of
citizenship
terminates
this
problem
of
actual
or
potential
embarrassment
to
the
united
states.
now,
if
petitioner's
theory
were
accepted
that
a
person
in
petitioner's
situation
would
be
able
to
continue
to
stay
in
foreign
countries
while
he
multiplied
embarrassments
and
dangers
to
the
united
states.
indeed,
as
was
suggested
i
believe
by
the
chief
justice
at
an
early
point
of
the
argument,
if
petitioner
had
stayed
in
cuba
and
stayed
in
their
armed
forces
or
if
he
served
in
the
armed
forces
of
soviet
russia
or
communist
china,
the
acceptance
of
this
--
of
the
petitioner's
theory
would
deprive
the
government
of
any
opportunity
to
do
anything
about
it.
now,
if
i
may
for
a
couple
moments
to
get
back
to
the
--
the
question
of
the
petitioner's
deportability.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
your
honor.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
definitely
not,
sir.
the
statute
has
a
provision
as
your
honor
knows
that
a
person
who
would
be
subject
to
physical
persecution
will
not
be
deported.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
your
honor,
we're
not
going
to
send
them
anywhere
apparently,
but
we
didn't
know
this
at
the
time
of
the
dictation.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
we
--
we
have
found
out
and
candidly
i
can
tell
your
honor.
we
have
made
inquiries
of
cuba
through
switzerland.
we
have
made
inquiries
of
mexico.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
no,
cuba
doesn't
want
him.
they
say
they
--
they
want
no
part
of
it.
mexico,
we
have
inquired
of
mexico,
mexico
will
take
him.
so
it
may
be
that
the
petitioner
will
continue
to
remain
in
this
country.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
oh
we
definitely,
we
can't.
we
have
to
send
them
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
i
can't
hear
you
sir.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
your
honor,
we
didn't
put
him
on
a
boat.
we
let
him
come
in
to
this
country
eventually.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
no,
sir.
no,
we
kept
him
in
detention,
we
didn't
put
him
afloat.
we
kept
him
in
detention
also.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
we
turned
him
loose.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
mezei
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
m-e-z-e-i.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
i
didn't
catch
your
honor's
question.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
if
your
honor's
referring
to
the
mezei
case,
he
was
sent
to
certain
countries
which
wouldn't
accept
him,
then
he
came
back
and
we
kept
in
detention
for
a
while.
this
court
upheld
that
detention.
eventually,
we
decided
there
was
nothing
we
can
do
about
him
and
we
turned
him
lose
under
some
restrictions.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
he's
still
in
the
united
states.
there's
nothing
we
could
do.
we
--
there
are
many
situations
your
honor
in
which
people
who
are
under
an
order
of
deportation
can't
be
sent
anywhere.
there
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
he
was.
he
was
found
to
be
subversive.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
he's
still
in
the
united
states.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
the
nation
stands.
of
course,
we're
not
sending
mr.
marks
at
any
place.
the
fact
is
that
he's
under
an
order
of
deportation.
if
he
remains
in
this
country,
he'll
enjoy
the
protections
of
the
constitution.
he'll
be
able
to
stay
here.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
protection
that
is
applicable
to
everybody
except
the
question
of
deportation.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
nobody
can
put
him
in
jail
without
a
trial.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
there
are
certain
exceptional
situations,
the
power
to
deport
as
your
honor
knows,
the
power
to
exclude
in
which
the
power
of
congress
to
decree
the
ground
and
so
forth
has
been
found
to
be
very
light.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
he
should've
thought
of
that
before
he
went
to
cuba.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
if
your
honor
pleases,
when
--
when
this
petitioner
went
to
cuba,
i
think
he
was
fully
aware
of
the
consequences.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
oh
yes,
oh,
he
--
he
will
be
at
completely
happy
situation,
he
can't
leave
the
united
states,
he
can't
become
a
citizen
until
he
regularizes
his
status
as
he
might
--
may
in
some
future
time.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
your
honor,
there
are
possibilities
and
if
i
may
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
he
was
born
in
milwaukee.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
no,
no,
no.
he
--
he
could
re
--
regain
his
citizenship
as
a
naturalized
citizen
but
only
if
he
becomes
a
lawful
resident
of
the
united
states.
now,
there
is
a
remedy
known
as
suspension
of
deportation.
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
naturalized,
naturalized.
he
couldn't
regain
--
mr.
murray
a.
gordon
well,
this
--
this
happens
to
anybody
who
has
lost
his
citizenship.
the
only
way
he
can
enter
the
country
is
as
an
alien.
the
only
way
he
can
regain
his
citizenship
unless
congress
decrees
otherwise,
is
as
a
naturalized
citizen.
thank
you,
your
honor.
