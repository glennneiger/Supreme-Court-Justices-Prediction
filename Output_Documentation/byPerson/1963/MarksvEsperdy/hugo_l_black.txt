doesn't
that
defend
to
some
extent
on
whether
the
government
does
it
or
whether
he
chooses
to
do
it
for
himself?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
think
anybody
has
argued
that.
i
thought
they
were
arguing
as
punishment
because
of
--
of
--
by
the
--
the
expatriation
by
the
government
because
of
something
a
man
has
done
against
the
citizen's
will,
then
that's
punishment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
the
government
moves
against
because
as
i
understand
in
the
argument's
view,
when
the
government
moves
against
somebody,
do
something
to
them
on
account
of
something
they
have
done.
this
--
there's
something
this
time
being
the
expiator
and
make
them
stateless
such
in
common,
pragmatic,
everyday
term
that
just
simply
means
that
he's
punished.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
their
citizenship
is
worth
nothing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
do
what
it
did.
i
would
suppose
that
if
congress
decided
to
expatriate
(inaudible)
speech
up
here,
that
you'd
consider
that
punishment,
wouldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
would
--
wouldn't
this
for
conduct?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
--
i'm
--
i'm
sure
that
a
lot
of
the
few
talks
about
it's
not
what's
involved.
certainly,
conduct
of
his
in
going
down
and
serving
in
the
army
is
involved.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
didn't
take
into
account
what
he
did
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
serving
to
the
other
army?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
who
were
they
punishing?
it's
not
him
by
expatriating
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
understand
the
rational
nexus
to
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
extend
that
statement,
no
government
have
--
whatever
you
said
to
exist,
recall,
except
the
government
if
they
didn't
have
a
right
to
expatriate
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
asking
you,
is
that
you
made
the
statement
with
reference
to
the
government
power
to
have
a
foreign
affairs.
and
you
made
it
on
the
premise
i
assume,
that
it
necessarily
follows
that
it
had
just
as
much
necessity
to
do
that
if
it
does
expatriate
people
as
it
does
to
deal
with
foreign
affairs
or
against
their
will,
that
was
your
premise
or
is
it
not?
is
that
the
reasons
you
may
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
say
no
nation
is
whether
to
exist
into
that
power
to
expatriate
these
people,
so
they
do
something
it
didn't
like
--
didn't
like.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you
what
page
that
was
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
60.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
with
reference
incurred
i
--
i
brought
back
in
the
dates.
at
the
time
of
that
entry,
had
any
court
held
that
he
had
spoken
to
a
citizen?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
had
dealt
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
who
had
the
right
to
declare
that
it
had
occurred
automatically?
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
of
the
government
sub-agencies.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
from
that
time
on
until
he
could
get
some
court
to
do
something
although
born
in
this
country,
he
was
not
a
citizen
to
this
country.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
he's
chosen
the
government.
the
government
could
decide
on
proceedings,
can
declare
that
he
was
not
a
citizen.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
be
a
question
or
whether
constitution
requires
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
when
he
voluntarily
decided
he's
going
to
expatriate
the
service
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
old
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
do
you
--
what
all
cases
are
then
if
--
in
which
the
congress
had
attempted
to
take
away
the
citizenship
foreign
automatically?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
did
that
--
when
did
that
first
come
to
be
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
have
the
same
situation
that
exists
if
he
was
there
and
they
tried
--
and
they
expatriate
them
over
here,
he'd
still
be
over
there
wouldn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

wouldn't
punish
him
or
anything
(inaudible).

man
sent
backwards

justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall
it,
he
was
sent
away
because
it
was
thought
he
was
so
subversive.he
might
destroy
the
country.
justice

he
do
that?
