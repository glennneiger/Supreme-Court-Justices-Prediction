mr.
john
j.
naughton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
issuance
of
a
writ
of
mandamus
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
directing
the
petitioner,
a
united
states
district
judge,
to
transfer
a
cause
of
action
arising
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
to
the
western
district
of
michigan,
the
southern
division,
sitting
in
grand
rapids,
michigan.
previous
to
the
ruling
by
the
petitioner,
denying
a
motion
to
transfer
made
under
section
1404
(a)
of
the
judicial
code,
the
same
case
had
been
brought
before
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county.
there,
the
plaintiff's
cause
of
action
was
dismissed
by
that
court
on
the
ground
of
forum
non
conveniens.
a
decision
below
issued
the
writ
of
mandamus
on
two
grounds,
on
the
grounds
of
full
faith
and
credit
as
stated
in
section
1738
of
the
judicial
code
and
on
its
finding
that
the
plaintiff
was
estopped
by
the
previous
ruling
under
a
so-called
estoppel
by
verdict.
arguing
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
here,
i
would
contend
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
clearly
incorrect
in
that
the
question
is
not
a
question
of
the
statutory
provision
of
full
faith
and
credit
creating
any
rights
in
the
respondent
here
to
have
a
particular
ruling
when
it
makes
a
motion
under
a
federal
provision.
i
would
also
contend
today
that
there's
an
inter
relationship
between
the
acts
involved
herein
that
is
section
1404
(a),
section
1738
and
section
6
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
the
case
arose
when
an
employee
of
the
respondent
by
the
name
of
jack
filbrun
was
injured
while
attempting
to
release
a
hand
break
on
a
car
in
the
respondent's
yard
at
ludington,
michigan.
he
states
that
when
he
attempted
to
release
this
hand
break,
it
suddenly
quickly
released
causing
him
to
fall
from
the
car
where
he
was
caught
by
his
conductor
and
was
injured.
subsequent,
that
injury
occurred
on
the
15th
of
july
in
1960,
subsequent
to
that
injury,
he
went
to
a
dr.
serb
who
was
indentified
in
the
record
as
a
company
doctor.
he
was
placed
in
a
hospital
and
he
was
told
by
that
doctor
that
there
was
nothing
to
matter
with
him.
he
went
to
other
doctors.
one
of
the
doctors,
a
dr.
boelkins
was
a
specialist
to
whom
he
was
referred
by
the
company.
some
of
the
other
doctors
were
doctors
of
his
own
choosing.
they
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
almost
all
were
in
ludington,
dr.
boelkins
was
in
grand
rapids,
michigan.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
60
miles.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
the
situation
came
according
to
his
affidavit,
which
is
contained
at
pages
72
to
74
of
the
record
that
his
physical
situation
was
such
that
he
was
getting
no
relief,
the
company
had
a
promised
him
a
specialist.
he
was
not
getting
a
specialist.
so
at
that
time,
he
decided
to
go
to
his
union
attorneys
in
chicago,
seeking
there
basically
medical
help
and
as
well
legal
help.
now
some
points,
it
has
been
raised
in
the
--
a
brief
respondent
here
that
i
am
associated
with
the
firm
that
represents
mr.
filbrun
and
that
is
correct.
i
am
also
here
by
virtue
of
appointment
by
his
honor
judge
parsons.
in
representing
judge
parsons
here,
i
don't
want
to
deceive
the
court
that
i
don't
have
a
--
a
special
interest
in
this
particular
case
being
associated
with
the
plaintiff's
attorneys
but
the
basic
representation
i
would
submit
here
by
me
is
on
behalf
of
judge
parsons
in
advancing
his
ideas
as
to
the
judgment
below
issuing
a
writ
of
mandamus.
the
plaintiff
when
he
came
to
chicago
was
eventually
placed
under
the
care
of
dr.
raven
at
the
--
his
attorney's
reference.
the
plaintiff
was
then
hospitalized
in
chicago
for
conservative
treatment
complaining
of
back
condition.
after
several
weeks
in
the
hospital,
he
was
released,
he
was
still
complaining
of
it.
he
was
placed
back
in
the
hospital,
a
myelogram
was
performed
and
it
was
discovered
that
he
had
a
disc
by
virtue
of
that
myelogram.
he
was
then
operated
on
and
on
the
operation,
disc
--
herniated
disc
was
found
between
the
fifth
lumbar
and
the
second
and
this
disc
was
herniated
to
such
an
extent
that
was
encroaching
on
the
spinal
cord.
now,
that
was
removed,
a
spinal
fusion
was
performed
and
he
was
under
the
care
and
treatment
of
dr.
raven
succeeding
that
operation.
now,
all
of
these
facts
here,
i
would
think
on
first
impression
were
not
encompassed
by
the
granting
of
the
writ
of
certiorari
by
this
court.
however,
in
its
brief,
respondent
contends
that
alternatively
the
court
below
ruled
that
the
petitioner
had
abused
his
discretion
in
denying
the
motion
of
transfer.
the
only
basis
for
that
language
is
contained
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
last
paragraph
thereof
at
pages
--
at
page
87
in
which
the
court
states
referring
to
the
previous
reasons,
these
reasons
are
sufficient
upon
which
the
grant
for
issuance
of
the
writ
requested,
the
transfer
of
this
case
to
the
federal
district
court
60
miles
from
plaintiff's
home,
the
scene
of
his
accident
all
combined
to
establish
that
justice
would
there
be
accomplished.
now,
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
not
a
square
holding
that
the
petitioner
abused
his
discretion.
the
dissent
specifically
finds
that
the
petitioner
did
not
abuse
his
discretion.
the
opinion
from
which
we
are
now
arguing
this
case
is
the
second
opinion
on
this
case.
previous
to
that,
there
was
an
opinion
by
which
the
petition
for
writ
of
--
of
mandamus
was
denied.
the
dissenting
opinion
was
the
majority
opinion
at
that
time
and
there
was
a
concurring
opinion
by
retired
circuit
judge
major
in
which
he
states
that
he
agrees
with
the
now
dissenting
opinion
that
there
had
been
no
abuse
of
discretion.
under
all
of
these
circumstances,
i
would
submit
that
there
is
no
question
of
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
this
case.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes
your
honor,
i
would
--
based
on
the
--
on
the
interlocutory
appeals
act,
i
would
think
that
it
could've
been
certified
by
the
petitioner
here
of
judge
parsons
and
could've
been
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
they
did
not
request
that.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes,
i
would
think
that
judge
parsons
in
his
case
would
have
certified
the
matter
under
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
if
that
request
had
been
made.
that
was
not
made.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
that
was
appealable.
it
takes
me
into
probably
the
first
statement
i
should
make
in
discussing
the
law
applicable
here.
the
--
the
case
seems
to
me
involves
the
--
the
effect
of
a
decision
of
a
court
deciding
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
of
forum
non
conveniens
and
i
would
suggest
that
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
it
was
outright
dismissal.
that
is
the
only
power
it
would
have
on
that
particular
motion.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
now,
such
a
decision
it
seems
to
me
involves
elements
of
discretion
and
of
matters
that
are
peculiar
to
the
court
deciding
the
motion
which
are
so
sui
generis
that
i
would
not
think
they
should
be
the
basis
of
a
--
of
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata
or
of
estoppel
by
verdict
in
the
later
proceedings.
and
as
to
that,
i
would
suggest
that
the
respondent
itself
states
in
its
brief
and
in
quoting
the
doctrines
of
res
judicata
and
estoppel
by
verdict
at
page
7
thereof
talking
about
one
of
the
commentators'
comments,
a
professor
query
that
this
is
a
matter
of
fact
a
practical
decision
as
to
what
a
res
judicata
or
estoppel
by
verdict
applies
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
dissent
below
is
a
very
practical
dissent.
it
states
that
the
majority
opinion
has
confused
the
material
issues
with
the
material
facts.
now,
respondent
seeks
to
avoid
that
type
of
ruling
below
or
that
type
of
consideration
by
this
court
here
by
stating
that
the
plaintiff's
residence
in
ludington,
michigan
is
a
mere
happenstance,
but
that
is
not
a
happenstance.
that
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
remedy
provided
in
section
1404
(a).
you
cannot
say
that
when
a
plaintiff
lives
in
ludington,
michigan,
he
should
be
treated
identically
to
a
plaintiff
who
lives
in
grand
rapids,
michigan.
the
congress
specifically
set
up
the
convenience
of
the
parties,
the
convenience
of
the
witnesses
and
the
interest
of
justice
and
it
intended
that
the
federal
district
judge
who
have
an
individual
right
to
determine
those
matters
in
the
particular
proceeding.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
60
miles
your
honor.
now,
the
--
what
drawn
in
concurring
opinion
stated
that
there
was
a
different
results
in
the
district
court,
that
is
a
transfer
rather
than
a
dismissal.
now,
we
make
no
point
of
that
here
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner.
we
do
make
a
point
that
the
ruling
below
and
the
contention
of
the
respondent
here
seems
to
imply
that
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
eastern
division
sitting
in
chicago,
illinois
and
also
by
virtue
of
other
division
sitting
in
freeport
and
peoria,
illinois
is
the
same
as
a
court
sitting
in
cook
county,
illinois,
and
we
would
contend
that
it
is
no
such
thing.
moreover,
the
statutes
of
the
united
states
permit
subpoenas
to
be
issued
out
of
district
courts
beyond
state
limits
to
the
extent
of
a
hundred
miles
from
the
place
where
the
court
sits.
and
for
that
reason,
it
can
be
seen
that
a
district
court
is
not
an
illinois
court
that
it
is
in
fact
an
illinois
court,
an
indiana
court
and
a
wisconsin
court
and
an
iowa
court
in
certain
instances.
the
confusion
of
the
opinion
below
is
such
that
it
would
seem
to
bring
into
a
play
in
this
case
the
decision
of
angel
versus
boeing,
which
is
a
decision
based
in
a
diversity
case.
the
reason
i
say
that
the
opinion
below
brings
this
case
into
our
case
is
because
the
circuit
judge
in
rendering
his
opinion
to
pay
some
particular
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
and
the
united
states
district
court
or
courts
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
that
is
under
section
6
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
a
--
a
plaintiff
has
a
cause
of
action
may
sue
in
either
a
state
court
or
a
federal
court
is
given
that
choice
of
forum
and
that's
a
very
valuable
choice
of
forum
given
to
him.
the
circuit
judge
schnackenberg
says
that
his
ruling,
and
i
quote
from
page
86,
a
one
sentence
after
the
full
faith
and
credit
determination,
"this
especially
true
because
if
it's
a
court
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
administering
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
as
provided
in
that
act.
"now,
with
all
due
difference
to
the
court
below,
that
ruling
is
not
true.
that
is
taking
a
valuable
right
given
to
a
plaintiff
and
interpreting
it
so
that
it
becomes
no
right
at
all,
so
that
it
is
actually
a
sword
turned
inwards
and
diminishing
the
plaintiff's
rights.
now,
the
second
question
cited
below
was
the
estoppel
by
verdict.
i
would
say
as
to
that,
the
nature
of
the
decision
below
is
such
that
there
is
no
finality
in
the
matter
and
i
think
that
basically,
the
court
below
again
is
confused
itself.
it
is
saying
that
a
decision
on
a
motion
for
forum
non
conveniens
is
a
decision
on
a
fact.
it's
a
decision
such
as
would
be
involved
in
saying
that
a
particular
piece
of
paper
was
a
deed
of
the
transfer
property
to
(inaudible).
that
is
not
what
is
involved
here.
i
think
that
looking
at
the
standards,
considering
the
--
maybe
this
nature
of
the
standards,
the
individual
characteristics
of
each
district
judge
and
the
discretion
vested
in
each
judge
to
decide
these
questions,
we
must
say
that
there's
a
certain
amount
of
weighing
and
balancing
here
as
mr.
--
circuit
judge
frank
said
in
the
ford
motor
company
decision
and
that
--
well,
we
say
that
these
are
determinations
of
facts
we
only
confuse
ourselves.
these
are
not
determinations
of
facts.
these
are
matters
of
--
of
particular
way
of
looking
at
deadlocks.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
no,
your
honor.
the
state
court
ruling
is
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
simply
an
order,
which
can
be
said
to
make
a
finding
of
fact
that
it
was
an
inconvenient
inappropriate
forum,
the
majority
opinion
does
so
find.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
there
were
no
explicit
findings.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
that's
the
cotton
versus
l.
&
n.
r.
r.
case
cited
in
the
both
party's
briefs.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
purely
vex
and
harass
the
railroad.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
that
is
the
standard.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
that
is
the
only
standard.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
well,
that
is
a
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
says.
i
don't
think
that's
accurate,
no.
i
wouldn't
dispute
the
result
and
i
would
dispute
the
--
their
way
of
writing
and
what
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
had
said
the
question
is
purely
a
question
of
vexation
and
harassment.
now,
once
that
consider
--
consideration
is
a
consideration,
the
question
is
how
does
the
court
ever
get
to
that
determination?
i
think
by
getting
to
that
determination,
they
do
consider
some
of
the
same
issues
that
is
the
convenience
of
the
parties,
the
convenience
of
the
witnesses
and
what
they
think
were
the
interest
of
justice.
i
think,
for
example,
they
consider
the
fact
that
they
have
a
seven-year
backlog
and
it's
part
of
the
determination
as
--
and
compare
it
with
the
alternative
course
which
of
course
when
the
circuit
court
had
the
matter
before
it
was
a
state
court
at
ludington,
michigan
whereas
as
the
dissent
says
when
the
matter
came
up
before
the
petitioner,
the
only
court
that
he
could
consider
was
the
united
states
district
court
of
grand
rapids
which
has
no
connection
with
the
--
the
litigation
with
the
single
exception
that
doctor
boelkins
is
resident
there.
the
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
the
plaintiff
was
a
resident
at
ludington
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
--
where
there
is
a
state
court.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
it
is
in
the
district,
yes.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
the
accident
happened
there.
the
accident
happened
on
a
canadian
national
box
car,
which
is
probably
in
--
in
canada
at
the
present
time.
there's
been
some
mentioned
on
the
view
of
the
premises
would
be
helpful.
i
don't
see
how
that
would
be
in
this
particular
case
and
petitioner
decided
that
it
would
not
under
these
circumstances.
the
matter
of
commuting
between
ludington
and
grand
rapids
is
a
matter,
which
would
take
some
time
away
from
the
various
witnesses.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
the
writ
of
mandamus
and
the
1404
(a),
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
do
it
on
two
bases,
one
that
i
think
an
interlocutory
appeal
was
the
proper
method
of
questioning
it
and
two,
i
think
that
this
type
of
discretionary
orders
are
not
such
--
it
create
extraordinary
circumstances
that
writs
of
mandamus
should
be
considered
by
courts
of
appeal.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
would
say
there's
a
conflict
in
the
circuits
of
course.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
respondent
check
--
cites
one
of
the
cases,
which
says
that
it
is
not
available.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes,
sir.
there
is
such
a
doctrine,
which
again
is
a
diminishment
of
the
plaintiff's
rights
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
would
say
no
on
that
--
on
the
basis,
that
full
faith
and
credit
and
estoppel
by
verdict
do
not
apply.
however,
i
would
say
that
in
those
circumstances
if
the
question
should
arise,
one
of
the
petitioner
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
well
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
--
i
would
say
that
the
district
court
probably
as
a
matter
of
comity
would
recognize
the
--
the
almost
identical
determination.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
it's
--
i
don't
see
how
the
fact
that
a
district
court
has
had
a
--
has
a
case
which
has
a
previous
state
ruling
and
it
can
evade
this
responsibility.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
would
still
say
that
he
would
not
be
bound
absolutely
by
that.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
well,
even
in
such
circumstances,
the
--
these
standards
are
crystal
clear.
they
are
matters
for
the
individual
judge.
i
don't
see
why
anyone
should
determine
that
a
district
judge
with
federal
statutory
standards
before
him
cannot
examine
those
standards.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
that's
the
--
that's
a
counsel
for
the
plaintiff.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes,
i
would
say
this
is
the
usual
rule.
i
have
here
from
volume
2
on
--
by
into
freeman
on
judgments
at
page
1582
of
the
statement
that
judgment
is
merely
a
dismissal
whether
voluntary
or
involuntary
are
not
on
the
merits.
they
do
not
operate
as
a
bar
or
as
a
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
--
subsequent
proceedings.
now,
that
is
the
general
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
it
would
so
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
yes.
that
is
the
only
decision
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
that
is
the
only
decision
we
would
submit
that
by
which
it
should
be
bound
as
a
decision
on
the
merits
or
decision
extending
estoppel
by
verdict
to
questions
of
fact
determined
not
questions
of
--
really,
what
our
value
judgment
should
not
determine
these
rights
in
the
second
forum.
now,
the
actual
motion
made
on
the
case
here
was
made
by
the
respondent,
railroad,
and
it
was
a
motion
addressed
to
1404
(a)
and
it
was
also
a
motion
of
which
--
on
the
first
motion,
it
was
stated
that
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata
apply
and
clearly
it
does
not
apply
in
this
case
though
respondent
is
still
contending
res
judicata
does
apply.
the
matter
was
denied.
subsequently,
an
answer
was
filed
by
the
respondent
denying
on
information
and
relief,
the
failure
of
the
handbrake
to
function
as
properly.
then
a
petition
for
a
rehearing
was
made
by
the
respondent,
and
it
was
that
that
petition
for
rehearing
that
the
respondent
first
raise
the
questions
of
full
faith
and
credit.
now,
it
seems
to
--
the
petitioner
here,
and
what
the
court
below
did
was
to
state
that
1738
in
setting
out
the
provisions
of
full
faith
and
credit
created
a
situation
where
something
more
than
res
judicata
and
something
more
than
a
estoppel
by
judgment
would
be
applied
by
the
district
court.
the
opinion
below
seems
to
indicate
that
full
faith
and
credit
on
its
own
creates
situations
where
federal
courts
have
to
give
extreme
difference
to
previous
rulings
for
state
courts.
i
would
submit
on
the
basis
of
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
holmes
in
remington
versus
central
potomac
railroad
company
that
those
sort
of
rulings
are
not
correct
that
this
is
by
the
rule
of
practice,
it
should
be
given
comity
but
the
state
court
decision
should
not
be
given
absolute
vitality
and
require
to
disregard
the
federal
standard.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
rebuttal,
i
would
merely
state
that
respondent
below
in
its
motion
in
the
circuit
court
complained
of
the
crowded
dockets
of
the
court
at
page
13
of
the
record.
it
also
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
of
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
naughton
i
would
also
state
that
at
page
46
of
the
record,
he
complained
of
the
crowded
dockets
of
the
united
states
district
court.
the
ruling
below
seems
to
imply
that
the
plaintiff
was
required
to
appeal
the
judgment
of
the
circuit
court.
such
an
appeal
can
only
be
taken
on
the
basis
that
the
circuit
court
judge
abused
his
discretion.
if
the
plaintiff
had
lost
that
appeal,
he
would
not
have
been
at
any
nearer
--
a
resolution
of
his
underlying
cause
of
action.
in
the
instant
case,
mandamus
has
been
issued.
the
united
states
district
judge
has
had
to
give
attention
to
this
matter.
some
of
the
united
states
district
judges
in
our
circuit
have
even
appeared
personally
before
the
courts
of
appeals
to
argue
these
mandamus
action.
there
is
a
remedy
available
under
the
interlocutory
appeals
act
and
i
suggest
that
it
is
not
a
very
good
procedure
in
the
administration
of
justice
to
require
the
district
judge
to
give
attention
to
these
mandamus
actions
that
the
interlocutory
appeals
between
the
parties
is
a
much
better
way
of
solving
any
problem
created
--
mr.
john
j.
naughton
as
i
understand
that
mr.
o'laughlin
is
wrong,
this
case
would
not
be
in
the
same
posture.
no
question
of
abuse
of
discretion
wouldn't
be
involved
under
the
interlocutory
appeals
act,
but
we
would
submit
that
these
questions
are
matters
of
judgment
and
that
the
courts
of
appeal
should
not
consistently
grant
these
motions.
these
writs
may
have
been
necessary
when
1404
(a)
was
a
new
statute,
it's
been
construed
by
many
courts
at
the
present
time,
i
think
that
the
issuance
of
such
writs
and
the
considerations
of
such
questions
should
be
estopped
by
this
court.
thank
you.
