mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
suppose
that
there
are
three
different
phases
of
this
argument
that
i
should
address
myself
to.
in
the
first,
did
the
district
court
give
the
proper
recognition
to
the
judgment
of
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
dismissing
the
case
under
forum
non
conveniens?
secondly,
did
the
district
court
properly
determine
that
transfer
to
the
western
district
of
michigan
was
not
in
the
language
of
the
statute
for
the
convenience
of
the
parties
and
the
witnesses
and
the
interests
of
justice?
and
thirdly,
if
either
of
those
two
questions
should
be
answered
in
the
negative,
was
mandamus
a
proper
remedy?
now,
what
was
the
judgment
of
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county?
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
determined
that
under
the
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens,
under
the
common
law
of
doctrine
of
forum
non
conveniens,
the
trial
of
this
case
in
cook
county
was
inappropriate
and
inconvenient.
now,
along
with
the
common
law
doctrine,
the
illinois
state
courts
seem
to
hold
or
seem
to
require
based
upon
this
cotton
case,
a
--
a
requirement
must
be
present
that
an
addition
to
be
inconvenient
and
inappropriate,
the
trial
court
must
find
that
the
plaintiff
acted
with
a
motive
to
vex
and
harass
the
railroad.
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
did
dismiss
the
case.
while
there
is
no
finding
of
fact,
the
judgment
of
the
court
being
a
mere
judgment
of
dismissal
under
illinois
law,
the
grounds
for
the
judgment
can
be
examined.
and
we
find
this
to
be
the
fact
that
the
court
dismissed
the
action
based
upon
the
same
allegations,
the
same
affidavits
that
were
present
before
the
united
states
district
judge.
to
support
its
motion,
the
railroad
showed
that
there
were
five
occurrence
witnesses
and
six
doctors
all
of
whom
resided
in
and
about
ludington,
michigan,
two
doctors
being
in
grand
rapids.
the
court
found
that
the
case
should
be
dismissed.
now,
instead
of
going
to
the
convenient
forum
ludington,
the
plaintiff
walked
down
the
streets
about
two
blocks
and
filed
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
yes,
but
i
would
say
that
certainly
it
would
be
a
no
rule
in
illinois
that
a
case
could
be
dismissed
under
forum
non
conveniens,
on
a
pure
showing
of
vexation.
you
must
build
a
vexation
on
the
--
on
the
foundation
that
is
that
there
is
inconvenience
in
presenting
testimony.
in
the
cotton
case,
the
accident
as
i
recall
happened
in
kentucky
and
the
trial
was
in
east
st.
luis
and
there
was
an
allegation
that
the
--
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
under
forum
non
conveniens
that
the
plaintiff
could
not
get
--
or
the
defendant
could
not
produce
the
medical
evidence
just
as
there
was
here.
on
the
trial,
the
--
and
this
was
how
the
case
was
reviewed,
the
evidence
showed
there
--
there
was
--
but
one
doctor
who
testified
and
he
spent
less
than
a
day
and
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
inconvenience
and
seemed
to
imply
that
there
should
be
vexation.
now,
there
has
been
--
there
have
been
other
forum
non
conveniensâ€™
decisions
in
illinois,
but
none
of
them
on
fela
cases.
now,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
differentiation
when
the
case
reaches
the
district
court
whether
it's
an
estoppel
by
verdict,
collateral
estoppel,
res
judicata,
full
faith
and
credit
or
what.
simply,
we
urge
that
the
determination
by
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
foreclosed
was
a
matter
decided
between
the
parties.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
well,
your
honor
--
and
i
address
myself
to
the
same
question
that
you
ask
the
counsel
here.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
of
course,
the
plaintiff
could
sue
where
--
where
he
could
get
jurisdiction
of
the
railroad.
he
could
do
it
until
there
was
an
adjudication.
he
could
take
a
voluntary
non-suit
and
start
as
many
times
as
he
chose,
but
once
there
was
an
adjudication,
once
there
was
a
judgment,
once
the
court
had
acted,
then
something
new
has
happened
between
the
parties.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
yes.
if
we
have
not
so
moved
your
honor,
there
would
have
been
no
jurisdictional
prohibition
if
that
is
your
honor's
question.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
no,
i
would
suppose
that
there
was
no
adjudication
on
the
--
on
the
merits.
now,
while
i'm
on
that,
i
might
say
this,
that
counsel
has
cited
a
number
of
cases
in
which
the
question
was
reexamined
and
--
but
if
you
examine
each
one
of
them,
you'll
find
that
there
was
no
final
judgment
so
that
the
--
there
was
a
defect
which
was
not
present
here.
in
other
words,
if
the
state
court
had
not
made
a
final
judgment,
if
the
case
had
been
submitted
and
a
voluntary
dismissal
made,
then
of
course
there
would
be
no
prohibition
at
all,
but
the
judgment
of
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
was
a
final
appealable
judgment
and
therefore,
it
was
res
judicata,
estoppel
by
verdict,
collateral
estoppel,
when
they
--
that
matter
was
brought
before
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
oh
yes,
that
was
clearly
a
place
where
the
action
might
have
been
brought
within
the
language
of
1404
(a).
i
--
i
take
it
that
there
is
a
comparatively
little
argument
made
or
even
--
the
argument
is
not
even
particularly
addressed
to
that
trial
in
grand
rapids
was
for
the
convenience
of
the
parties
and
the
witnesses.
there
was,
but
one
witness
in
illinois
and
that
after
the
injured
man
had
retained
counsel.
a
simple
1101
arithmetic
indicates
the
convenience
of
the
parties
and
the
witnesses
and
i
would
say
here
that
there
is
and
will
be
a
serious
issue
as
to
the
extent
of
this
man's
injury.
six
doctors
concluded
that
he
was
not
injured
and
one
found
that
he
was
and
operated
on
him.
these
men
will
be
called
upon
by
the
railroad
to
testify.
were
the
trial
to
take
place
in
cook
county,
the
railroad
would
be
deprived
of
the
in-person
evidence
of
these
witnesses.
justice
would
be
--
it
would
be
in
the
interest
of
justice
that
this
testimony
be
available
to
the
railroad.
transfer
to
grand
rapids
would
make
that
available.
it
is,
therefore,
my
conclusion
and
i
believe
that
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
agreed
that
failing
to
transfer
based
upon
that
record
was
a
gross
abuse
of
discretion.
now,
counsel
has
pointed
to
the
opinion
and
says
this
is
not
a
square
holding.
the
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus
claimed
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
as
well
as
claiming
our
rights
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
statute.
the
court
ruled
upon
it
and
under
familiar
rules,
its
judgment
can
be
supported
both
on
the
grounds
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
statute
and
under
the
abuse
of
discretion
provision.
i
think
that
the
court
did
find
that
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion.
of
course,
the
court
was
more
--
merely
acted
interested
in
the
collateral
estoppel
argument.
if
we
concede
that
there
is
grounds
to
claim
that
there
was
error
in
the
district
court,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
argument
that
mandamus
was
an
appropriate
remedy.
i
believe
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
the
counsel
if
in
his
judgment
he
believed
that
the
interlocutory
appeal
statute
was
available
here.
the
interlocutory
appeal
statutes
requires
a
finding
in
the
order
that
a
controlling
principle
of
law
is
involved
and
a
finding
that
the
ultimate
disposition
of
a
case
will
be
advanced.
there
was
no
such
finding
in
the
order.
true,
none
was
requested,
but
as
it
stood,
there
was
no
way
when
that
order
was
entered
that
it
could
have
been
appealed
under
that
--
under
that
provision
of
the
statute,
but
i
would
say
even
further
an
interlocutory
appeal
here
would
not
be
any
different,
the
--
the
posture
of
the
case
would
be
no
different.
it
would
be
exactly
the
same
as
it
would
be
under
the
writ
of
mandamus
proceedings.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i
do
not
discount
that
your
honor.
i
--
traditionally,
mandamus
is
an
extraordinary
remedy.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
well,
i
would
just
to
say
it
is
to
answer
it.
i
do
not
believe
this
ordinary
remedy
is
readily
available.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
the
reason
we
did
not
do
so
--
seek
this,
of
course,
it
was
found
in
the
first
requirement.
that
is
that
there
is
a
controlling
principle
of
law.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
yes.
and
i
--
and
it
was
our
judgment
that
this
was
not
a
controlling
principle
of
law.
this
was
a
--
a
very
un-controlling
principle
of
law.
true
on
this
particular
issue,
it
was
controlling,
but
i
read
that
and
as
being
controlling
on
the
--
on
the
matter
of
adjudication
before
the
court,
i
can
see
that
to
be
some
new
noble
principle
of
law
with
which
the
court
is
concerned
in
the
interpretation
of
the
case
that
it
might
conceivably
wish
the
ruling
of
the
reviewing
court
prior
to
the
taking
of
testimony
and
--
and
involving
itself
at
great
length.
but
on
the
issue
--
issue
of
the
mandamus
itself,
under
the
all
writs
act,
i
believe
that
it
has
everywhere
been
considered
that
the
court
of
appeals
does
have
the
power.
it's
not
a
question
of
power.
and
the
cases
that
had
been
here,
i
don't
think
anyone
has
urged
that
the
court
under
proper
circumstances
could
issue
a
writ
of
mandamus.
we,
therefore
past
as
to
whether
writ
of
mandamus
is
proper
in
this
type
of
case.
to
a
degree
of
course,
this
is
a
matter
of
policy.
i
think
that
the
holding
of
this
court
in
la
buy
versus
howse
is
most
persuasive.
in
that
case,
judge
la
buy
had
transferred
a
case
to
a
master
court
hearing.
a
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus
was
filed
in
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
it
issued.
and
this
court
affirmed
even
though
the
propriety
of
the
issuance
of
the
writ
was
strongly
challenged.
this
court
twice
has
held
that
a
jury
demand
should
be
recognized
and
mandamused,
the
trial
court
twice
to
preserve
that
remedy
even
though
in
both
cases,
the
courts
of
appeal
had
not
acted
on
the
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus,
in
other
words,
they
had
denied
the
writ.
yet
this
court
felt
that
the
control
of
the
process
of
litigation,
the
jury
demand
in
the
two
instances
was
proper.
i
would
say
this
that
particularly
under
1404
(a)
cases,
if
the
respondent
is
ever
to
have
a
remedy,
it
must
be
by
way
of
mandamus.
if
it
goes
to
trial,
the
inconvenience
and
the
lack
of
justice
has
been
suffered
and
then
the
respondent,
defendant,
is
in
the
position
of
trying
to
show
prejudicial
error
and
it's
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
point
to
one
specific
thing
and
say,
prejudicial
error
has
been
suffered
by
the
failure
to
transfer
it.
it
can
always
be
claimed
that
the
evidence
of
doctors
being
presented
by
way
of
deposition
adequately
--
was
adequate
in
the
defense
of
the
case.
every
trial
lawyer
faced
with
convincing
the
jury
knows
that
depositions
are
not
a
persuasive
way
of
presenting
key
evidence.
the
cost
has
been
incurred
so
that
the
remedy
if
we
are
going
to
have
it
appealable
at
all
must
be
undertaken
prior
to
the
time
the
trial
was
held.
i
think
that
proper
administration
of
justice
indicates
that
in
proper
cases,
the
courts
of
appeal
should
issue
the
writ.
now,
i
do
recognize
that
there
is
at
least
one
decision
and
i
believe
it's
cited
in
the
brief
of
the
court
of
appeals,
i
believe
in
tenth
circuit
holds
that
even
though
there
was
a
proper
case
and
abuse
of
discretion,
the
writ
should
not
issue.
most
of
the
other
circuits
have
taken
the
other
view
and
i
think
in
proper
administration
of
justice
that
should
be
the
view
of
this
court.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
say
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i
think
that
we
--
we
sometimes
overlook
what
we
really
mean
by
discretion.
this
isn't
the
--
a
wild
whim
of
a
judge.
it's
a
--
it's
a
consideration
of
the
relevant
factors
between
the
parties
and
it's
in
a
forum
discretion.
it
was
adjudicated
by
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
relying
upon
the
same
factors,
which
the
district
judge
must
take
into
consideration.
now,
you
may
â€“
i
may
argue
a
theoretical
difference
that
the
subpoena
power
of
the
district
court
might
cross
the
state
lines
but
in
this
case,
that
is
only
a
theoretical
difference.
it
has
no
relevance
to
the
case
at
bar.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i
think
that
the
illinois
courts
particularly
and
perhaps
they
--
they
should
recognize
that,
but
in
the
same
cotton
case,
the
--
the
court
held
that
the
inconvenience
of
the
litigation
was
tribute
on
the
court
system.
in
other
words,
this
was
not
a
factor.
one
case
among
60,000-70,000
was
not
a
factor,
which
the
trial
court
should
take
into
consideration
and
that
was
not
urged
in
this
particular
case.
in
other
words,
the
congestion
of
the
calendar
in
cook
county
was
not
one
of
the
factors
relied
upon
by
the
railroad
for
a
dismissal
of
--
under
forum
non
conveniens.
so
i
would
say,
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
in
theory,
but
in
practice
i
would
say
not.
i
know
that's
traditionally
supposed
to
be
a
defendant's
gamut
but
to
defend
the
case,
you
need
fresh
evidence.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
i
think
that
congestion
hurts
both
parties.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
impeach
justice.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
the
last
civil
case
that
i've
tried
in
cook
county
with
a
jury
demand
was
seven
years
old.
i
think
that
the
district
court's
judges
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois
each
maintain
its
own
calendar.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
and
i
think
that
the
time
of
trial
runs
from
about
a
year
to
maybe
two
years
that
they're
reached
in
rotation
and
tried
when
ready.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
in
civil
jury
cases.
however,
i'll
be
very
frank
to
admit
that
if
you
were
really
desirous
of
a
very
expeditious
trial
in
the
federal
courts,
i
know
of
no
judge
that
wouldn't
accommodate
you.
in
the
same
token,
if
there
is
a
recognized
advancement
system
in
the
circuit
--
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
cook
county
circuit
court.
mr.
charles
j.
o'laughlin
and
that
has
worked
out
just
to
the
fashion.
the
--
but
itâ€™s
suffice
for
this
case
that
the
tribunal
itself
has
not
made
a
factor
in
forum
non
conveniens
either
under
section
1404
(a)
or
in
the
state
court.
i
would,
therefore,
conclude
by
saying
that
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
adjudicated
that
cook
county
was
an
inconvenient
and
inappropriate
place
to
try
this
case.
i
think
that
the
district
court
should've
concluded
that
a
trial
in
the
western
district
of
michigan
was
in
--
for
the
convenience
of
the
parties
and
the
witnesses
and
the
interest
of
justice.
i
think
that
the
district
court
should've
afforded
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
judgment
of
the
state
court.
i
think
that
by
