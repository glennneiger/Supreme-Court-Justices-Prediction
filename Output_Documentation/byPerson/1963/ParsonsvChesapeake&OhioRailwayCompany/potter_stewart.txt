these
all
the
doctors
are
in
or
around
at
ludington
or
in
michigan?
justice
potter
stewart
how
far
is
ludington
to
grand
rapids,
about
40
or
50
miles?
justice
potter
stewart
60
miles.
justice
potter
stewart
it
should
have
required
a
certification
though
on
your
view
by
the
district
judge,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
does
state
court
make
any
findings
of
fact?
justice
potter
stewart
simply
an
order
of
dismissal?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
were
no
explicit
findings
were
there?
justice
potter
stewart
of
fact?
under
illinois
law,
is
this
matter
addressed
to
the
--
basically,
to
the
discretion
of
the
highest
court?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
is
as
i
understand
it
an
additional
--
in
illinois
law
an
additional
consideration
which
the
court
has
required
to
consider
that
as
when
the
action
was
brought
to
harass
or
vex
the
railroad?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
only
standard?
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
of
appeals
here
says
that
that's
a
--
that
the
illinois
court
has
all
the
federal
standards
plus
that
standard.
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
i
misread
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
the
plaintiff
was
a
resident
there,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
district
--
in
the
district?
justice
potter
stewart
--
district
of
michigan
and
the
accident
happened
there?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
quarrel
with
the
--
do
you
question
the
--
do
you
question
the
availability
of
a
writ
of
mandamus
in
appropriate
circumstances
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
course
you
know,
you
do
question
that?
justice
potter
stewart
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do?
justice
potter
stewart
haven't
the
courts
of
appeals
rather
generally
said
that
mandamus
is
available
i
--
and
apply
different
standards
as
to
when
the
mandamus
will
be
granted?
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
even
the
availability
of
this?
one
--
one
or
two
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
one
or
two
of
them,
the
second
circuit
for
instance
that
made
a
distinction
saying
it's
available
if
the
transfer
is
denied
but
not
available
if
it's
granted
or
vice
versa,
are
you
(inaudible)
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
if
--
as
you
implicitly
concede
and
have
been
held
this
for
the
trial
judge
is
ultimately
a
matter
of
his
discretion,
doesn't
that
by
definition
almost
exclude
any
kind
--
any
idea
of
res
judicata
if
it's
purely
discretionary
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
it
might
also
the
differences
in
the
calendar
congestion
in
the
cook
county
courts
as
compared
to
the
federal
courts.
again,
that
might
be
theoretical
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
congested
calendar
in
the
long
run
that
worked
to
the
advantage
of
the
defendant?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
impeach
justice
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
by
a
very
well
party,
you're
probably
right.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
what
is
the
comparative
congestion
between
the
cook
county
courts
and
the
district
court
here
in
chicago,
in
civil
cases
the
district
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
in
civil
jury
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
i
remember
that,
in
the
cook
county
court.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
think
if
you
use
that
too
liberally
well,
i'm
not
sure
right
back
where
you
started.
justice
potter
stewart
that
statute
wouldn't
apply
--
well,
it
might
arguably
apply
in
this
case
where
the
question
was
a
res
judicata
controlling
question
of
law.
it
wouldn't
apply,
would
it,
in
a
case
where
the
judge's
action
in
transferring
or
refusal
to
transfer
a
case
under
1404
was
thought
by
the
losing
party
to
be
simply
a
flagrant
abuse
of
discretion
especially
by
these
terms
would
not
apply,
wouldn't
it?
