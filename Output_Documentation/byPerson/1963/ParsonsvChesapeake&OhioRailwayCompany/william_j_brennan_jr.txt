justice

but
could
the
state
court
transfer
order
in
contrast
appealable
for
like
--
justice
william

--
state
of
appellant
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
state
court
decision
was
a
dismissable,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not
a
transfer
of
course.
it
was
outright
dismissal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
far
is
ludington
from
grand
rapids?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
naughton,
you
might
--
might
you
have
voluntarily
dismiss
that
state
court
action
and
then
brought
this
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
mean.
as
i
gather
what
you're
saying
to
us
is
that
since
that's
the
right
of
the
plaintiff
under
fela,
there
can't
be
anything
res
judicata
about
what
the
state
court
has
done
on
a
motion
to
transfer
on
forum
non
conveniens
beyond
perhaps
giving
some
consideration
of
what
the
state
court
did
because
the
issue
arose
in
the
state
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
was
going
a
little
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
was
going
a
little
beyond
that.
i
was
wondering
whether
you
were
relying
on
the
fact
that
under
the
fela,
the
claimant
may
go
in
--
either
into
the
state
or
federal
court,
and
you
suggest
that
the
fact
goes
in
one
does
as
far
as
dismissing
that
action
and
then
going
in
the
other
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it's
because
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
because
you
ought
to
flow
from
that
is
that
he's
not
bound
by
anything
that
happens
necessarily
short
of
a
decision
on
the
merits
of
his
claim.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
o'laughlin,
i
gather
you
didn't
take
the
position
that
the
plaintiff,
the
fela
plaintiff
could
not
go
down
the
street
two
blocks
and
file
his
lawsuit
there,
did
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i
want
to
get
clear
was,
there
was
nothing
about
the
state
court
proceeding
which
barred
him
from
bringing
his
federal
court
suit
two
blocks
down
the
street.
you
had
to
invoke
the
transfer
rule
i
gather,
didn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
federal
transfer
rule
in
order
to
defeat
the
trial
of
this
case
in
the
district
where
he
brought
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
may
not
be
relevant
mr.
o'laughlin
but
might
the
railroad
--
might
jurisdiction
of
an
action
against
the
railroad
had
been
obtained
in
a
federal
district
court
actually
in
grand
rapids?
