mr.
leslie
hall
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i
think
i
should
start
out
by
pointing
out
to
the
court
the
provisions
of
the
alabama
code
that
would
deal
with
this
particular
situation.
title
15,
section
278,
provides
that
no
objection
to
an
indictment
on
any
ground
going
to
the
formation
of
the
grand
jury
which
found
the
same
can
be
taken
to
the
indictment
except
by
plea
in
abatement
to
the
indictment.
and
no
objection
can
be
taken
to
an
indictment
by
plea
in
abatement
except
from
the
ground
of
the
grand
jury
who
found
the
indictment
were
not
drawn
by
the
officer
designated
by
law
to
the
draw
the
same
and
neither
this
objection
or
any
other
can
be
taken
to
the
formation
of
a
special
grand
jury,
someone
direct
--
direction
of
the
court.
and
section
279
of
that
same
title,
provides
any
plea
in
abatement
to
an
indictment
must
be
filed
at
the
first
session
at
which
the
indictment
was
found.
if
the
accused
has
been
arrested
or
if
the
accused
has
not
been
arrested,
such
plea
in
abatement
must
be
filed
at
the
first
session
at
which
it
is
practicable
after
the
defendant
has
been
arrested,
and
in
all
cases,
such
plea
in
abatement
must
be
filed
before
the
plea
to
the
merits.
now
--
mr.
leslie
hall
no
sir.
they
are
referred
to
in
my
brief
and
mr.
justice
black
at
--
on
page
3
but
they're
not
copied
into
the
brief.
mr.
leslie
hall
alright
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
no
objection
to
an
indictment
on
any
ground
going
to
the
formation
of
the
grand
jury
which
found
the
same
can
be
taken
to
the
indictment
except
by
plea
in
abatement
to
the
indictment.
that's
the
real
pertinent
point
of
that
particular
one,
a
subjection
to
the
formation
of
the
grand
jury
and
it
has
to
be
done
by
plea
in
abatement
prior
to
--
mr.
leslie
hall
yes,
sir.
the
trial
court
held
that
and
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
in
numerous
cases
has
followed
that
same
rule
of
procedure.
mr.
leslie
hall
in
this
case,
after
the
trial
court
refused
to
allow
evidence
on
the
question
of
the
formation
of
the
grand
jury
in
connection
with
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
because
of
the
fact
that
no
plea
in
abatement
had
been
filed
prior
to
the
time
that
the
defendant
was
arraigned
then
the
defendant
who
was
represented
on
his
motion
for
new
trial
by
a
different
counsel
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
argued
that
question
before
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
said
there
was
no
evidence.
he
is
correct
in
that.
mr.
leslie
hall
in
effect
that's
what
they
said,
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
well
i
--
mr.
leslie
hall
i'll
explain
it
this
way,
if
i
can
--
mr.
leslie
hall
he
was
denied
the
opportunity
to
present
the
evidence
in
support
of
his
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
the
ground
that
under
alabama
procedure,
he
was
supposed
to
raise
that
question
prior
to
his
pleading
to
the
indictment
and
he
was
--
mr.
leslie
hall
--
supposed
to
raise
that
by
plea
in
--
mr.
leslie
hall
they
didn't
point
out
that
particular
ground.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
maybe
i
don't
understand
either,
but
the
fact
remains
that
they
did
affirm.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
no,
they
denied
him
the
opportunity
to
--
mr.
leslie
hall
they
used
some
unfortunate
language
there,
i'm
afraid
mr.
--
mr.
leslie
hall
--
justice
black.
mr.
leslie
hall
well
now,
the
--
mr.
leslie
hall
i
don't
think
the
court
had
to
even
make
that
statement.
they
could've
founded
the
--
mr.
leslie
hall
they
did
make
it.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
agree
that
he
was
not
given
enough
opportunity
--
mr.
leslie
hall
--
and
the
other
--
the
trial
judge
denied
him
the
opportunity
on
the
basis
of
the
previous
holdings
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
on
--
mr.
leslie
hall
the
only
thing
that
was
attempted
there
along
that
line
was
when
the
circuit's
list
was
put
on
the
witness
stand
as
an
adverse
witness
by
the
attorneys
for
the
petitioner
and
attempted
to
ask
him
some
questions
about
the
population
ratio
there
and
bring
--
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
i'm
afraid,
i'd
have
to
agree.
is
an
--
it's
an
embarrassing
situation
for
me
to
get
into.
i'd
have
to
come
up
here
and
tell
you
that
but,
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
leslie
hall
i'm
sorry
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
case
your
honor.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
that's
correct.
there's
the
--
the
record
of
the
trial
court
does
--
does
not
support
that.
now
--
mr.
leslie
hall
i
don't
believe
they
have,
your
honor.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
i
heard
they
mentioned
the
case
of
arrington
but
i
don't
read
that
case
that
way
and
--
mr.
leslie
hall
it
holds
that
the
procedure
in
alabama
requires
the
defendant
who's
going
to
raise
any
question
as
to
the
composition
of
the
jury.
either
grant
a
petit
jury
to
raise
that
question
prior
to
arraignment
of
the
defendant
on
the
indictment
or
prior
to
go
into
trial
pleading
to
the
merits
as
far
as
the
petit
jury
is
concerned.
mr.
leslie
hall
the
supreme
court?
mr.
leslie
hall
as
to
our
understanding
it
--
my
understanding,
it
did,
yes
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
the
--
the
court
said
he
was
too
late
in
raising
--
mr.
leslie
hall
--
it
afterward.
mr.
leslie
hall
the
court
said
he
was
too
late
in
raising
the
question
afterwards.
mr.
leslie
hall
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
--
mr.
leslie
hall
--
was
not
the
place
to
do
it.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
i
don't
know.
i
think
he's
wrong
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
leslie
hall
you
mean
the
court
of
appeals
of
alabama?
mr.
leslie
hall
of
this
circuit?
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
let
me
to
point
out
something
in
connection
with
those
two
cases
that
the
--
they
cited
here.
they
mentioned
the
case
of
willie
seals.
that's
the
case
of
united
states
on
a
relation
to
willie
seals,
jr.
versus
wyman.
i'm
somewhat
familiar
with
that
case.
it
came
in
a
little
bit
late
but
i
--
i
do
know
that
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
his
conviction
on
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
and
he
went
back
and
was
reindicted
and
was
retried
and
resentenced
this
time
to
a
life
sentence
rather
than
to
the
electric
chair.
mr.
leslie
hall
the
--
the
reason
why
they
reversed
it
the
first
time,
because
he
was
represented
by
a
white
court
appointed
attorney.
and
the
evidence
showed
definitely
in
that
case
that
this
white
attorney
did
not
know
and
made
no
reasonable
effort
to
ascertain
the
population
ratio
as
far
as
persons
eligible
to
serve
on
the
grand
and
petit
juries
of
mobile
county
was
concerned.
he
so
testified
on
the
stand
that
he
had
no
idea.
that
was
judge
johnson
brother
by
the
way,
judge
frank
m.johnson's
brother
who
represented
him.
and
--
so
the
--
the
evidence
showed
clearly
in
that
case
that
he
had
no
means
of
knowledge,
late
--
least
he
failed
to
be
diligent
about
obtaining
the
knowledge
in
order
to
--
and
properly
inform
his
client
as
to
what
his
rights
were.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
now,
in
the
--
mr.
leslie
hall
in
the
mississippi
case,
the
case
of
united
states
on
a
relation
of
golsby
versus
harpole.
that
was
another
case
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
judge
reeves
wrote
the
opinion
in
that
case.
and
it
--
it
just
so
happens
the
facts
are
these,
at
the
time
of
the
arraignment
of
this
man,
he
was
represented
by
a
negro
counsel.
but,
some
reason
or
another,
between
the
time
of
his
arraignment
and
the
time
of
his
trial,
the
--
a
white
counsel
were
employed
to
represent
him.
and,
the
court
said
that
this
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
in
that
case,
that
his
negro,
retained
counsel
had
effectively
waived
the
question
at
the
time
of
his
arraignment.
so
he
was
a
little
different
--
when
in
fact
quite
a
bit
difference
from
the
willie
seals
case
where
they
said
that
his
white
appointed
counsel
did
not
effectively
waived
the
question
and
therefore,
the
court
reversed.
but
in
--
in
the
harpole
case,
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
that
his
counsel
had
properly
and
effectively
waived
the
constitutional
question
forwarded.
mr.
leslie
hall
the
seals
case
was
after
the
harpole
case.
mr.
leslie
hall
it
was
before.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
goes
back
to
1950
--
1962,
late
1962.
if
i
remember
the
date
correctly,
it
was
may
the
30th
or
may
the
20th.
i'm
not
quite
sure.
mr.
leslie
hall
no
sir.
the
statute
is
still
the
same.
mr.
leslie
hall
no
recent
cases
besides
this
one
on
that
question.
we
--
i've
checked
the
party
parts
and
the
digest
on
it
before
and
this
seems
to
be
most
recent
case
on
it.
now,
in
my
brief,
i
make
a
quotation
here
from
one
of
the
cases
from
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
that
is
brennan
versus
the
state
in
which
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
said,
there's
no
skilled
lawyer
would
ever
attempt
to
raise
such
a
question
until
after
conviction.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
think
so,
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
i'd
expect
everybody
to
have
due
process
at
least
to
--
mr.
leslie
hall
yes,
and
the
reason
being
by
the
lower
court
that
he
didn't
raise
the
question
at
the
proper
time.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
if
they
had
said
that,
they
would've
been
going
contrary
to
their
holdings
in
--
in
other
cases
and
also
contrary
to
the
statutes.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
he
--
he
had
an
opportunity
for
due
process.
he
could've
raised
it
by
plea
in
abatement.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
the
--
i
think
the
alabama
supreme
court
would
have
to
reverse
what
it
said
in
this
brune
(ph)
case
that
i
was
just
quoting
from
about
a
person
taking
his
chances
on
getting
an
acquittal
and
then
if
he's
dissatisfied
and
gets
convicted,
he
could
then
comeback
with
a
motion
for
new
trial
and
seek
to
do
something
that
he
couldn't
do
otherwise.
therefore,
it's
my
honest
argument
gentlemen
that
the
court
affirmed
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
that
is
due
to
the
statutory
provision
that
we
have
in
alabama
that
all
capital
cases
are
--
are
automatically
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
the
supreme
court
is
required
to
look
at
the
whole
record
and
determine
--
mr.
leslie
hall
sir?
mr.
leslie
hall
well
--
mr.
leslie
hall
if
they
found
no
reversible
error,
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
even
point
out
wherein
they
failed
to
find
no
reversible
error.
they
could
make
an
affirmance
without
going
into
any
great
detail
about
it
if
they
examined
the
whole
record
as
they're
required
to
do
by
statute.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
i'm
afraid
that
i
can't.
