those
statutes
are
not
covered
in
your
brief,
are
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
reading
that
first
one
again.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can't
--
what
can
be
done
under
plea
in
abatement
and
what
cannot?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
your
trial
court
held,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
within
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
there
was
--
they
said,
he
was
not
denied
an
opportunity,
did
he
not,
to
offer
that
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
how
can
you
explain
that?
i
don't
--
understand
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
plainly,
he
was
denied
the
opportunity.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
he
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
supreme
court
affirmed
it
but
not
on
that
ground.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
didn't
affirm
it
on
that
ground,
did
they?
i
--
i
just
--
i
do
not
understand
this
opinion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
did
affirm
it,
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
by
saying
--
that
--
the
trial
court
had
given
him
an
opportunity
to
offer
the
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
they
did,
but
the
supreme
court
said
he
had
been
--
he
had
the
opportunity.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
well,
mr.
hall,
i
--
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
not
affirmed
which
on
a
basis
which
was
not
(inaudible)
but
the
judgment
below,
charging
him
was
a
different
event,
very
much
likely.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
a
different
event.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
but
here,
they
--
they
affirmed
it
on
the
ground
that
--
which
directed
them
forward.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
of
appeals
has,
i
believe
as
you
said,
it
seems
to
me
i
recall
reading
them,
held
that
it
would
not
be
bound
by
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
the
--
of
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
district
--
of
the
united
states
courts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
they
reverse
it
the
first
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
court
--
the
court
therefore
declined
in
effect
to
follow
these
tactics
in
that
case,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
the
other
one
also.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
did
the
seals
case
come
before
or
after
the
case
--
the
decisions
(voice
overlap)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
comes
before
or
after
the
decision
of
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
before.
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
short
time
before?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
been
any
change
in
the
statute
or
anything
(voice
overlap)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
there
been
any
other
cases
besides
this
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
think
about
the
--
when
was
this
automatic
appeals
statute
passed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
--
this
cases
only?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
relate
to
--
what
kind
of
cases
does
this
relate
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
capital
--
capital
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
says
that
that
may
be
explained
in
the
supreme
court's
opinion,
i
am
trying
to
think
it
might.
it
says
that
in
all
cases
of
automatic
appeals,
the
appellate
court
may
consider
its
discretion
in
a
testimony
that
was
here
to
be
prejudicial
to
the
rights
of
the
appellants
may
reverse
thereon
even
though
no
lawful
objection
or
exception
was
made
therein.
they
might
have
construed
that
to
mean
that
that's
related
to
the
--
an
offer
of
new
testimony
and
that
was
prejudicial.
which
would
--
i
would
presume
overriding
the
other
section
about
the
plea
in
abatement.
this
was
a
statute,
was
it
not,
passed
for
the
legislature.
