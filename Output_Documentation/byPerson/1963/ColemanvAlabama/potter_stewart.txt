justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
--
i
have
a
question.
let's
--
let's
assume
you're
right
about
this
and
you
certainly
are
correct,
actually
it's
correct
in
your
--
correct
in
your
characterization
of
what
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
said.
let's
assume
we
think
that
you're
right,
what
--
what
would
you
have
us
--
this
court
do?
justice
potter
stewart
this
isn't
cole.
now
cole
--
cole
was
a
case
in
which
i
thought
the
man
was
tried
under
the
--
something
other
than
which
he
had
been
charged
with.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
your
answer
but
i
--
but
i
--
okay.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
trial
court?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
now,
let's
say
we
should
--
just
thinking
you're
right
by
hypothesis
and
we
should
set
aside
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
remand
the
case
to
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
would
be
faced
with
the
clear
rule
in
alabama
that
the
way
they
were
--
raised
this
is
by
a
plea
in
abatement,
wouldn't
that
be
true?
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore,
i
would
--
i
would
--
i
--
it's
bound
to
follow
the
law
of
alabama
and
would
therefore
deny
you
the
right
to
put
in
this
evidence
at
this
late
date.
and
that
would
then
be
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
on
the
basis
of
the
alabama
procedural
law.
is
there
anything
to
prevent
that
happening?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
--
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
did
in
this
case
among
other
things
is
to
simply
make
a
factually
mistaken
statement
that
the
--
that
the
defendant
was
given
an
opportunity
to
present
this
evidence.
now,
the
facts
are
that
he
wasn't.
justice
potter
stewart
would
they?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
you
would
have
us
therefore
say
that
despite
the
law
of
alabama
which
requires
in
its
clear
terms
that
an
objection
to
the
makeup
of
the
grand
jury
has
to
be
raised
by
a
plea
in
abatement
before
arraignment
on
indictment.
despite
that
clear
law,
we're
to
say
that
in
this
case,
because
of
the
language
of
the
supreme
court's
opinion,
this
man
has
a
right
to
a
trial
of
that
issue
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
this
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case
at
least.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
if
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
also
holds
or
at
least
the
opinion
says
that
this
man
was
given
a
full
opportunity
to
produce
this
evidence.
so
we
can't
take
this
--
all
of
these
--
all
the
words
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
this
opinion
and
--
and
decide
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
he
states
the
law
of
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
what
--
so
--
so
you
asked
us
to
set
aside
the
judgments
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
remand
this
case
to
the
trial
court
for
a
full
hearing
on
--
whether
or
not
there
was
a
racial
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
the
grand
jury,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
now,
taking
it
--
let's
assume
that
we
do
that
that.
that
we
think
you're
right
and
we
do
just
that.
and
then
let's
say
the
--
the
trial
court
in
alabama
has
such
a
hearing
and
--
and
decides
that
there
was
--
here's
--
here's
a
lot
of
evidence
and
then
decides
on
the
evidence
that
there
was
no
--
no
such
racial
discrimination.
then
it
comes
up
to
the
alabama
supreme
court
which
then
says,
“well,
it's
a
matter
--
matter
of
alabama
law.
we're
not
even
going
to
look
at
that
evidence
because
it
was
too
late.”
all
i
had
to
--
has
been
done
by
a
plea
of
in
--
plea
in
abatement.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
that
--
that's
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
decides
the
alabama
law,
isn't
it,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama?
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
be,
quite
rightly
involved
in
--
with
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
we
had
that
argued
yesterday.
