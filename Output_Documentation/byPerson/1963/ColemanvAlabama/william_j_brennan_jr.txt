justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
at
least
tell
me
whether
i'm
wrong
about
it.
(inaudible)
--
i'm
looking
at
page
32
of
the
record
and
the
actual
language
is
appellant's
attorney
--
i'm
speaking
now
of
your
supreme
court,
appellant's
attorney
was
given
an
opportunity
on
the
hearing
in
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
to
produce
evidence
and
so
forth.
and
then
they
go
on
to
say
that
he
didn't
produce
enough
evidence.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
to
be
read
as
implying
a
holding
that
was
utterly
immaterial
that
he
didn't
raise
this
on
a
--
a
plea
in
abatement,
that
his
difficulty
was
that
he
hadn't
offered
enough
evidence.
and
the
court
make
no
mention
of
the
fact
that
he
tried
to
offer
enough
evidence
but
the
trial
court
wouldn't
let
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they
did
make
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
have
to
put
some
reading
on
it,
don't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
agree
that
he
was
not
given
an
opportunity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
they
didn't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
the
reason
--
and
you
don't
--
you
--
you
have
no
idea
what
evidence
would've
come
into
the
record
had
he
been
given
an
opportunity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
just
an
opening
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
--
but
that
was
the
end
of
the
examination.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so
the
court
is
clearly
wrong
when
they
said
that
they
--
you
said
not
--
he
was
granted
an
opportunity.
