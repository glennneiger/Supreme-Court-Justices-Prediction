mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
capital
case
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
it
involves
the
question
whether
the
courts
of
that
state
can
refuse
to
give
petitioner
an
opportunity
to
put
on
evidence
and
then
affirm
his
conviction
because
he
failed
to
carry
a
burden
of
proof.
the
facts
are
these,
petitioner
john
coleman
is
a
negro,
who
was
indicted
and
convicted
for
the
murder
of
a
white
man
by
juries
of
greene
county
alabama.
greene
county
is
in
the
western
part
of
the
state,
a
very
rural
country.
approximately
80%
of
the
population
is
of
the
negro
race.
at
petitioner's
trial,
it
was
represented
by
court
appointed
white
attorney,
who
failed
and
did
not
assert
his
constitutional
rights.
the
juries
chose
him
without
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes.
after
conviction,
a
negro
attorney
was
called
into
the
case
by
petitioner's
family.
he
filed
a
timely
motion
for
new
trial
explicitly
alleging
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
the
grand
and
petit
jury,
and
a
hearing
was
held
on
this
motion
for
new
trial.
but
at
the
hearing,
counsel
was
not
permitted
to
introduce
testimony
establishing
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
because
the
trial
court,
at
the
urging
of
the
prosecutor,
took
the
view
that
the
question
could
not
be
raised
for
the
first
time
on
motion
for
new
trial,
that
it
--
it
had
to
be
raised
under
alabama
procedure
prior
to
the
trial.
on
appeal
--
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
yes,
your
honor.
on
appeal,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
held
that
petitioner
had
had
an
opportunity
at
the
hearing
on
the
motion
for
new
trial
to
introduce
evidence
of
systematic
exclusion
that
he
had
the
burden
of
proof
and
that
he
had
not
placed
into
evidence
sufficient
evidence
to
prove
jury
discrimination.
the
court
said
absolutely
nothing
about
any
waiver
and
quite
clearly
decided
the
case
on
a
ground
which
made
waiver
moot.
now,
as
the
ruling
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
which
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse
is
the
opportunity
which
that
court
said
petitioner
had
on
the
hearing
for
motion
for
new
trial
to
introduce
evidence.
i
refer
the
court
to
that
hearing
which
is
in
the
record,
pages
15
to
23,
and
mainly
we're
concerned
with
that
portion
of
the
hearing
which
begins
on
page
18.
let's
expose
what
happened
at
that
hearing
where
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
says
petitioner
had
an
opportunity
to
carry
a
burden
of
proof
and
to
introduce
evidence
of
systematic
exclusion.
petitioner's
counsel
at
the
hearing
attempts
to
place
on
the
stand
the
two
circuit
solicitors
who
had
tried
petitioner
in
order
to
prove
the
allegations
of
the
motion
for
new
trial.
and
on
page
18,
we
see
the
response
of
the
circuit
solicitor.
he
argues
that
the
question
has
been
waived
and
there
on
the
11th
line
at
page
19,
he
urges
to
the
trial
court,
we
don't
think
any
evidence
along
that
line
would
be
legal
and
we
would
object
any
evidence
because
it
would
just
be
a
waste
of
time.
now
at
this
point,
the
trial
judge
says
he
doesn't
know
what
petitioner's
counsel
would
put
on.
petitioner's
counsel
attempts
to
offer
proper
--
the
kind
of
proof
he's
willing
to
put
on.
he
argues
that
the
trial
court
has
the
discretion
to
hear
that
evidence.
the
trial
judge
says,
“no.
you
put
your
witness
on
the
stand.
if
there
are
any
objections
to
the
questions
you
ask
him.
i'll
rule
on
the
questions,
on
the
objections.
in
that
way,
we'll
determine
the
issue.”
so
on
page
20,
the
solicitor
is
placed
on
the
stand
and
the
foundation
is
laid.
he
--
he
testifies
that
he's
practiced
law
on
the
county
for
a
number
of
years,
that
he
is
familiar
with
negroes
and
whites
in
the
county,
that
he
has
never
missed
the
grand
jury
in
the
county.
but
when
the
question
comes
now,
“what's
the
population
or
the
ratio
--
population
ratio
between
the
races?”
bang!
objection,
the
issue
can't
be
raised
for
the
first
time
on
motion
for
new
trial.
and
on
page
22
of
the
record,
the
trial
court
clearly
sustains
that
objection
on
just
that
ground.
petitioner's
attorney
asks
two
more
questions,
how
many
negroes
if
any
were
on
the
grand
jury,
same
objection,
same
disposition.
how
many
negroes
if
any
were
on
the
petit
jury,
same
objection.
he
can't
take
advantage
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
this
way,
same
disposition.
now,
it's
elementary
i
think
that
--
that
this
is
not
a
hearing
consummate
with
due
process.
there
was
no
opportunity
to
introduce
testimony.
and
i
don't
understand
the
state
now
to
take
the
position
that
--
a
position
contrary
to
that.
although
the
state
opposed
rehearing
and
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
on
that
ground,
that
petitioner
did
have
an
opportunity.
but
now
the
state
seems
to
be
arguing
something
different
that
--
it
was
in
fact
the
waiver.
i
don't
believe
that
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
the
judgment
here
on
review,
is
susceptible
to
that
interpretation.
first,
the
court
said
absolutely
nothing
about
waiver.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
that
--
the
question
of
systematic
exclusion
of
negroes
from
the
grand
and
petit
jury,
could
not
be
raised
for
the
first
time
on
motion
for
new
trial
and
that
if
it
were
raised
for
the
first
time
on
motion
for
new
trial,
no
evidence
would
be
permitted,
because
the
right
would
be
waived.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
that's
what
i
mean
by
waived.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
the
waiver?
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
yes,
it
was.
the
--
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
the
court
didn't
mention
it.
the
state
cited
waiver
cases
to
the
court.
they
were
not
cited
in
the
court
--
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama's
opinion
but
fairly
easy
idea
to
convey.
there
are
many
opinions
in
--
in
alabama
where
--
where
the
waiver
holding
is
the
one
which
disposes
of
the
case,
nothing
like
it
in
this
opinion.
but
most
important,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
decided
this
case
on
the
ground
which
is
totally
incompatible
with
the
finding
or
holding
of
waiver.
in
other
words,
what
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
did
and
it's
right
here
on
pages
32
and
33
of
the
record,
in
its
opinion,
it
held
that
petitioner
had
a
burden
of
proof
and
he
hadn't
--
haven't
met,
it
held
on
the
evidence.
now,
if
you
don't
have
any
right,
it
makes
no
difference
whatsoever,
how
much
evidence
you
put
on.
what
the
--
what
the
trial
court
did
was
say
you
had
no
right,
so
you
can't
put
on
any
evidence.
what
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
does,
put
that
--
put
the
waiver
argument
to
the
side
and
decide
completely
on
the
basis
of
evidence.
now,
i
don't
think
it's
important
whether
or
not
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
had
any
power
under
alabama
law
as
viewed
from
prior
cases
to
do
what
it
did.
the
judgment
in
this
case
is
bottomed
on
a
finding
of
the
evidence,
not
on
a
finding
of
waiver.
the
--
the
judgment
of
the
--
in
this
case
is
bottomed
on
petitioner's
opportunity
to
introduce
proof.
but
nonetheless,
there
are
alabama
cases,
the
clark
and
arrington
cases
which
are
cited
on
page
12
in
our
brief,
where
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
done
exactly
what
it
did
here.
in
other
words,
the
jury
question
was
raised
for
the
first
time
on
motion
for
new
trial,
the
case
came
up
from
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
it
decided
the
case
on
the
evidence
or
indicated
that
it
had
the
power
to
decide
the
case
on
the
evidence.
there
is
even
a
--
a
very
recent
case
on
coram
nobis
where
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
said
we
know
in
deciding
this
case
that
the
petitioner
here
did
not
raise
this
question
prior
to
trial
or
on
motion
for
new
trial,
that's
the
howard
case
in
151
southern
reporter.
and
there's
another
one
where
the
same
statement
is
made,
the
sills
case,
126
southern
reporter.
so
as
we
view
this
case,
it
comes
clearly
under
the
rule
of
cole
versus
alabama,
recently
reaffirmed
by
this
court,
i
think
about
two
weeks
ago
in
the
shuttlesworth
case,
that
a
supreme
court
of
a
state
must
dispose
of
a
case
upon
consideration
of
what
happened
in
the
trial
court.
now,
in
cole
the
--
the
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
on
the
basis
of
a
violation
of
law
which
was
not
tried
below
and
this
court
reversed
it
because
the
--
the
criminal
defendant
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
defend
himself
to
put
in
evidence.
so
here,
petitioner
has
not
had
an
opportunity
to
put
in
evidence
establishing
a
constitutional
defense.
the
reason
he
hasn't
had
that
opportunity
is
because
the
trial
court
took
the
view
totally
incompatible
with
the
view
taken
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
that
he
had
no
right,
no
right
to
establish.
now,
i
think
coming
to
this
record
cole,
the
court
might
have
some
question
about
why
the
supreme
court
did
what
it
did,
even
though
it's
totally
explicit,
what
it
did.
and
i
think
the
answer
is
in
two
cases
briefly
discussed
in
our
brief,
the
sills
and
golsby
cases
in
which
the
fifth
circuit
has
held
that
in
situations
like
this,
where
a
negro
is
represented
by
a
court
appointed
white
lawyer
in
the
south,
and
the
state
does
not
show
that
he
knowingly
and
intentionally
waived
his
constitutional
rights
that
if
the
fifth
circuit
is
held
that
it
will
not
be
precluded
from
examining
the
evidence
of
the
jury
question.
and
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
knows
about
this
cases
and
it
is
modifying
what
--
what
we
might
call
its
traditional
policy
of
--
of
being
fairly
hard
on
litigants
who
don't
raise
the
question
early
in
light
of
these
cases,
in
light
of
its
knowledge
that
the
same
issue
was
going
to
be
relitigated
in
the
fifth
circuit
if
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
holds
waiver.
but
i
want
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
i
don't
think
any
analysis
based
on
those
cases
is
involved
here.
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
did
what
it
did,
and
that's
the
judgment
here
for
review.
the
only
--
the
only
way
i
can
rationalize
the
state's
argument
is
that
they
are
saying
to
this
court,
alabama's
supreme
court
could've
held
waiver.
it
could've
decided
in
this
case
on
nonfederal
grounds,
and
if
--
because
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
didn't
do
it,
it
could
have,
this
court
should
do
it.
now
there
are
a
long
line
of
cases
where
this
sort
of
position
has
been
argued
to
the
court
and
it's
always
been
rejected.
the
leading
case
is
--
is
grayson
versus
howard
--
harrison
in
267
u.s.i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
unless
the
court
has
some
additional
questions.
we
have
no
further
argument.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
well,
i
think
the
--
the
disposition
should
be
similar
to
cole.
the
--
the
case
should
be
reversed
and
--
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
i
think
this
petitioner
is
entitled
to
an
opportunity
to
prove
systematic
exclusion
in
the
courts
of
alabama.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
right,
if
--
if
--
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
well
--
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
i
think
that's
totally
inconsistent
with
the
reading
of
this
court
--
of
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
--
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
--
which
this
court
would
have
to
make
to
make
that
disposition
of
the
case.
in
other
words,
to
dispose
of
a
case
as
we
suggest
--
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
--
one
reason
the
--
the
supreme
court's
opinion
is
putting
the
waiver
rule
aside
saying
it's
not
the
law
of
this
case.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
that's
right.
you
had
an
opportunity.
and
certainly
the
--
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
had
indicated
in
the
past
that
it
--
it
had
the
power
to
do
what
it
did
in
this
case.
but
i
don't
think
its
material.
all
these
discussions
about
the
statute,
it's
not
material
because
what
the
supreme
court
did
in
this
case
--
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
--
is
crystal
clear
and
that's
the
judgment
before
this
court,
not
the
whole
corpus
of
alabama
law.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
and
that
is
--
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
in
that
sense
denies
the
petitioner
an
opportunity
to
sustain
a
federal
question.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
i
suppose,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
this
case
is
also
the
law
of
alabama.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
that
--
that
those
statutes
don't
constitute
the
full
corpus
of
alabama
law
that
this
cases
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
and
this
opinion
must
be
read
as
holding
that
you
can
raise
the
question
for
the
first
time.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
in
the
--
in
this
case
--
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
--
but
this
case
also
holds
that
you
can
raise
the
question
for
the
first
time
on
motion
for
new
trial.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
and
--
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
no.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
well,
maybe
--
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
well,
i
think,
there,
we
have
to
draw
some
distinction
between
the
--
the
interpretive
function
of
this
court
and
--
and
what
this
opinion
says
is
alabama
law.
now,
that
perhaps
i
should
indicate
that
--
that
this
--
the
rule
of
these
statutes
is
hardly
inflexible.
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
in
the
clark
case
cited
in
brief,
in
1940
faced
with
the
identical
situation,
the
question
was
raised
for
the
first
time
by
a
new
lawyer
on
motion
for
new
trial.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
well
--
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
well,
i
--
there
are
--
there
is
language
in
that
opinion
which
i
think
is
much
stronger
than
that.
after
all
the
court
says
we
are
at
the
opinion
and
so
hold
and
then
decides
the
case
on
the
evidence.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
(inaudible)
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
well
--
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
well
it
--
if
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
had
the
discretion
to
decide
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
then
--
then
our
problems
are
solved
because
--
then
this
court
has
discretion
to
review
the
federal
question.
and
also,
it's
--
it's
easy
to
see
why
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
did
what
it
did
in
this
case
because
it
had
the
power
to
decide
the
case
on
the
evidence
alone.
whether
or
not
it
did
in
the
clark
case,
it
certainly
indicated
that
it
had
the
power
to
do
so.
and
there
is
like
language
in
the
arlington
case
and
there
is
like
language
in
the
sills
and
howard
cases.
but,
i
reiterate,
i
don't
even
think
that's
important
because
this
judgment
is
bottomed
on
a
finding
that
you
can
raise
the
question
on
motion
for
new
trial
for
the
first
time.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
yes.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
well,
i
--
i
think
that
would
just
be
totally
inconsistent
with
these
court's
mandate.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
the
court
did
--
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
that's
true.
it's
decided
that
in
--
it
has
failed
to
assert
the
state
--
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
--
procedural
ground
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
(inaudible)
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
yes,
we
filed
application
for
rehearing
and
in
two
briefs
filed
to
support
that
application,
pointed
out
that
we
did
not
have
an
opportunity
in
the
trial
court
to
introduce
evidence.
at
that
point,
the
states
switched
its
ground
that
it
had
been
arguing
waiver
all
the
time,
and
it
said,
“you
did
have
an
opportunity",
something
which
--
which
counsel
of
the
state
here
today
agrees
that
we
did
not
have.
the
rehearing
was
denied
for
that
opinion.
may
i
say
this
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
--
i
think
that
the
problem
you
poses
is
perhaps
inherent
in
--
in
this
court's
jurisdiction.
and
whenever
it
decides
a
--
a
question
of
--
whenever
it
decides
what
a
supreme
court
of
a
state
has
done
with
respect
to
state
law,
this
problem
is
involved.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
i'm
afraid
i
don't
have
any.
i
--
i
haven't
considered
the
question.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
it
was
passed
in
1941
after
the
--
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
well,
--
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
oh,
we
have
--
we
have
--
it
relates
to
capital
cases.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
yes.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
this
is
a
capital
case.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
that's
correct.
we
--
we
have
cited
that
--
that
provision
as
supportive
of
the
power
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
to
do
what
it's
done
here
and
suggested
it
could
in
other
cases.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
three
times,
record
shows
on
pages
19
and
20,
that
counsel
sought
to
tell
the
court
what
he
was
going
to
be
prove.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
if
defendant
had
been
permitted
to
prove
what
he
wanted
to
prove,
i'm
afraid
that
he
can't
read
the
opinion
that
way.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
yes,
except
that
it's
unclear
what
the
word
"evidence"
means.
it
might
--
it
may
mean
evidence
that
could've
been
brought
out
which
was
precluded
by
a
ruling
of
the
lower
courts.
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
now,
i
have
no
case
which
says
that
but
i
--
mr.
michael
c.
meltsner
as
applied
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama's
discretion.
thank
you.
