may
be
admitted.
mr.
--
mr.
meltsner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
argued
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
court
didn't
mention
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hall.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
mr.
hall
if
your
court
has
departed
from
those
statutes
at
any
other
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
hear
the
cases
that
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
does
that
hold?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
did
it
--
what
did
the
court
proceed
to
do
after
saying
that?
did
it
--
did
it
hear
the
case
on
the
merits?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
--
that
he
had
not
--
the
defendant
had
not
raised
it
at
the
proper
time
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
--
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
know
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
know
your
case
but
counsel
just
cited
two
cases
in
which
he
said
that
the
supreme
court
had
considered
cases
on
the
merits
where
those
statutes
had
not
been
followed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hall,
i
just
want
to
ask
you
one
question.
i
reviewed
this
para
--
short
paragraph
from
the
brief
of
the
petitioner.
he
says,
this
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
suggest
that
the
court
shows
to
ignore
that
failure
to
raise
the
question
of
systematic
exclusion,
because
the
case
came
to
that
court
under
the
automatic
appeals
statute
compare
arrington
versus
state,
253
alabama
178,
where
the
duty
of
the
court
is,
“to
examine
all
evidence
for
reversible
error
without
the
necessity
of
seasonable
objection.”
why
do
you
have
to
say
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
that
--
you
can
make
a
distinction
clear
in
that
--
in
these
cases.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
says,
“without
the
necessity
of
seasonable
objection.”
and
you're
pointing
out
to
us
that
they
didn't
object
to
the
jury
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
seasonably.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
that
--
and
your
court
has
said
that
in
this
kind
of
occasion,
this
is
a
capital
case
also
that
they're
obliged
to
take
the
case
and
to
examine
all
evidence
for
reversible
error
without
the
necessity
of
seasonable
objections.
how
do
you
distinguish
that
case
and
this
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
meltsner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
welcome.
