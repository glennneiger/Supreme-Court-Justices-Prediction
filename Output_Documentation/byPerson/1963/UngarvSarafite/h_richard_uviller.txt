mr.
h.
richard
uviller
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
as
a
practicing
lawyer
and
particularly
as
a
prosecutor,
i
sometimes
wish
that
our
constitution
were
not
still
so
full
of
mysteries
and
surprises,
but
i
think
that
we
do
have
a
right
to
rely
on
certain
interpretations
of
this
court
dealing
with
questions
in
the
recent
past
similar
to
one
in
issue.
here
we
have
a
judge
who
sat
during
two
trials
of
an
extremely
difficult
and
sensitive
case.
one
in
which
emotions
were
high,
one
in
which
public
attention
was
focused
upon
the
courtroom
with
great
intensity,
sat
and
dealt
with
a
witness
who
was
avowedly
a
close
personal
friend
of
the
defendant
on
trial
and
yet
whose
testimony
was
essential
to
the
prosecution
of
the
case.
these
two
men
were
named
as
coconspirators.
the
conspiracy
was
such
that
it
was
necessarily
one
which
was
carried
out
in
secret
and
the
coconspirator
was
therefore
an
essential
and
necessary
witness.
it
was
indeed
in
order
to
obtain
his
testimony
against
the
then
borough
president
of
new
york
that
he
was
accorded
immunity
from
prosecution
in
the
grand
jury.
nonetheless,
he
maintained
throughout
the
first
trial,
and
throughout
his
testimony
in
the
second
trial,
an
attitude
inconsistent
with
that
of
a
witness
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
he
was
avowedly
interested
in
securing
an
acquittal
for
his
friend,
the
defendant
on
trial,
and
not
avowedly
but
quite
evidently
from
his
tactics
equally
concerned
with
a
securing
if
he
could
in
this
trial.
his
testimony
throughout
both
trials
is
replete
with
instances
of
evasion
or
purposeful
of
failures
of
recollection,
if
i
can
term
them
such.
there
is
no
question
about
the
fact
that
he
saw
his
role
as
alternate
attorney
for
the
defendant
against
whom
he
was
purportedly
testifying.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there's
an
exchange
in
the
record
itself
to
that
effect
where
he
was
asked,
you
realize
of
course
mr.
ungar
that
the
defendant
here
is
represented
by
counsel
of
his
own
and
mr.
ungar
responded
to
that,
no
i
do
not.
faced
with
this
dilemma,
the
court
in
an
effort
to
be
completely
fair
not
only
to
this
difficult
witness
but
perhaps
more
importantly
to
the
defendant
there
on
trial
still
might
to
lead
to
confine
the
witness's
answer
to
the
proper
conduct
of
a
witness
at
a
trial.
time
and
again
he
instructed
him
both
in
chambers
privately,
and
while
he
was
on
the
stand
that
he
was
to
answer
questions,
that
he
was
not
to
volunteer
information,
that
he
was
not
to
offer
objections
to
questions
that
he
was
asked,
and
that
he
was
not
to
comment
on
whether
or
not
those
questions
were
fair
and
proper
questions,
but
the
defendant
was
represented
by
an
attorney
who
could
both
bring
out
during
the
normal
process
of
cross
examination
and
a
thing
that
might
have
been
omitted
on
the
direct
examination
or
object
to
questions
that
were
improper.
nonetheless
he
persisted
in
this
course
of
action
until
it
came
to
the
point
where
he
was
asked
a
question
of
vital
and
central
significance
in
the
trial.
he
was
asked
what
mr.
jack
said
when
he,
sidney
ungar,
had
told
him
that
there
was
a
full
scale
grand
jury
investigation
in
progress
concerning
this
alleged
conflict
of
interest
and
a
high
city
official.
now
of
course
there
was
a
charge
here
of
conspiring
to
obstruct
justice
and
to
prevent
the
grand
jury
in
its
investigation
from
learning
the
truth
about
these
transactions
and
so
it's
literally
apparent
that
this
question
was
perhaps
the
most
crucial
question
at
the
trial
and
i
think
mr.
ungar
realized
it.
his
answer
to
that
question
i
think
can
be
fairly
characterized
as
nothing
short
of
equivocation.
he
said
that
was
part
of
a
conversation.
he
said
i
cannot
answer
the
question
in
that
form.
when
the
court
and
i
think
quite
properly
as,
as
after
all
the
man
who
was
charged
with
responsibility
of
maintaining
an
orderly
trail
on
the
issues
told
mr.
ungar
to
answer
the
question.
mr.
ungar
turned
to
him
and
as
the
mandate
recites
in
a
loud
and
insolent
and
disorderly
manner
shouted
this
phrase
which
has
been
repeated
here.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
he
shouted
the
phrase
which
has
been
read
here,
your
honor.
he
shouted
that
that
he
is
unfit
to
testify,
that
the
court
is
suppressing
the
evidence.
at
that
point
instantly
the
court
said
to
him,
you
are
contemptuous
and
you
are
also
disorderly
and
insolent.
nonetheless,
nonetheless
the
court
deferred
action
and
indicated
that
it
was
to
defer
action.
now
in
doing
so
the
court
was
mindful
of
a
not
too
ancient
decision
of
this
court
in
people
against
--
in
sacher
against
united
states
in
which
divert
procedure
had
been
sanctioned
by
this
court.
the
deferred
exercise
of
a
power,
it
was
held,
is
not
to
extinguish
it.
to
delay
the
administration
of
an
acknowledged
power
is
not
to
evaporate.
now
i
do
think
that
we
can
start
someway
here
and
i
think
perhaps
that
proper
place
to
start
is
that
a
court
does
enjoy
the
inherent
power
to
punish
instantly
and
by
an
abbreviated
procedure
a
person
who
is
contemptuous
and
disorderly
in
its
presence.
this
statute
is
not
vague
in
defining
the
crime,
this
statute
adds
the
additional
element
which
is
not
present
in
the
federal
law
that
the
conduct
must
tend
directly
to
interrupt
the
proceedings
of
the
court
or
to
detract
from
the
dignity
normally
accorded
to
a
court
of
law.
proceeding
under
this
statute,
the
court,
i
think
we
must
acknowledge,
could
have
instantly
punished
sidney
ungar
for
contempt.
as
a
matter
of
fact
sidney
ungar
who
was
not
only
an
attorney
in
the
state
of
new
york
but
a
very
articulate
attorney
as
evidenced
by
this
record
itself
acknowledged
to
the
court
at
the
time
of
the
proceedings
which
are
here
being
reviewed
that
the
court
could
have
punished
him
instantly
at
the
time
of
his
utterance.
the
real
question
then
is
whether
or
not
this
power
which
the
court
enjoyed
at
that
time
was
lost
by
the
action
of
the
court
in
deferring
its
exercise.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
it
certainly
would
mr.
justice
black
and
i
think
that
if
that
were
the
only
purpose,
if
that
were
the
only
justification
for
the
brief
or
procedure
of
a
summary
contempt,
then
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
argue
that
the
power
remained
after
the
purpose
of
disappear.
nonetheless
recalling
the
sacher
case
once
again,
it
was
their
help
and
i
think
with
some
reason,
that
the
power
itself
is
not
based
upon
the
necessity
for
immediacy
only.
it
is
not
simply
the
need
to
pick
action
at
the
point
where
it
will
do
the
most
good
during
the
trial.
there
is
an
addition
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
certainly
if
the
attack
is
such,
if
the
--
record
itself
indicates
that
the
court
has
lost
that
appearance
of
impartiality
which
is
so
vital
to
a
trial
and
to
justice
then
i
should
think
a
better
procedure
would
be
for
the
judge
to
refer
to
another
judge.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
i
wouldn't
go
that
far
mr.
justice,
for
this
reason.
i
believe
tat
we
cannot
here
assume,
all
of
the
judges
are
of
course
men,
and
this
was
discussed
in
the
sacher
case
too,
judges
are
human
thank
goodness,
but
i
would
not
conceive
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
the
record
--
i
think
the
record
in
case
shows
if
i
may
mr.
justice
black
that
this
judge
exercised
super
human
self
control.
there
is
not
one
single
incident
in
this
record
which
shows
that
the
court
in
any
way
became
entangled
with
the
defendant,
that
he
abused
the
defendant,
that
he
even
provoked
the
defendant.
the
only
utterances
by
this
court
that
were
reflected
in
this
record
are
efforts
of
the
court
to
contain
the
witness.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
there
is
no
such
standing
rule,
no
your
honor.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
this
particular
judge
is
very
strict
about
that,
and
during
certain
proceedings
he
will
not
allow
spectators
to
leave,
this
apparently
was
one
of
them.
of
course
during
the
charge
to
the
jury
when
the
court
is
also
the
focus
of
the
attention
in
the
courtroom
there
is
a
standing
rule
that
no
spectators
leave
or
come
in,
and
i
think
that
probably
the
judge
was
applying
that
rule
to
this
situation.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
there
is
no
such
general
rule
that
i
know
of
your
honor,
but
i
must
say
that
occurrences
such
as
this
are
extremely
rare
in
that
court.
but
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
for
a
court
to
adjudicate
a
man
in
contempt.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
your
honor
i
would
say
that
the
basis
of
this
contempt
was
both
aspects
of
the
statute,
but
the
statute
does
not
talk
about
an
actual
disruption
of
the
proceedings
of
the
court,
but
rather
actions
tending
to
disrupt,
and
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
the
court
advanced
the
recess,
the
luncheon
recess,
at
that
point
it
might
very
well
actually
disrupted,
and
i
think
it
certainly
could
be
labeled
conduct
tending
to
disrupt,
when
a
witness
has
flatly
stated
in
the
middle
of
his
testimony
that
he
will
not
go
on.
i
should
think
that
this
certainly
would
be
considered
disruption
of
the
progress
of
trial.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well
actually
i
have
not
quiet
completed
that
thought.
what
i
was
going
to
say,
was
that
i
think
that
there
is
not
only
one
purpose
to
the
summary
contempt
power.
i
think
that
the
immediacy
is
one
and
i
think
that
a
brief
procedure
which
is
the
other
aspect
of
summary
contempt
of
course
naturally
would
go
along
with
the
necessity
for
immediate
exercise,
but
i
think
there
is
a
second
and
the
second
is
vital
and
it
is
the
second
i
think
which
justifies
the
matter
of
application
of
the
contempt
power
in
this
case.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
the
second
i
believe
is
this
that
the
court,
the
sitting
court
has
knowledge
of
all
the
facts
necessary
to
make
the
adjudication
and
hence
there
is
no
trial
of
an
issue
in
the
conventional
sense.
there
is
no
necessity
to
try
and
establish
the
truth
or
falsity
of
an
alleged
state
of
facts.
it
is
characteristic
of
the
work
of
a
trial
court
that
by
its
various
procedures
which
over
the
ages
have
come
down
to
us
as
the
best
or
the
most
effective
that
we
can
think
of,
by
cross
examination,
by
confrontation,
by
the
use
of
an
attorney
services,
by
adjournment
in
order
to
produce
witnesses
and
so
forth,
we
are
attempting
to
establish
a
fact
to
the
satisfaction
of
a
fact
finder
who
has
no
personal
knowledge
of
the
existence
or
non
existence
of
that
prior
event.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
i
know
the
doctrine
that
your
honor
is
referring
to
and
it
certainly
has
been
stated
by
many
justices
of
this
court
throughout
the
history
of
these
proceedings
that
only
the
least
power
necessary
to
the
proposed
end
is
justified.
i
would
be
the
first
to
concede
that
the
contempt
power,
the
power
of
a
judge
sitting
in
a
trial
to
send
a
man
to
jail
without
the
conventional
safeguards
attaching
to
a
trial
is
a
grave,
a
serious
and
a
dangerous
power.
perhaps
it
is
indeed
a
unique
power,
but
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
it
is
both
a
necessary
power
and
a
logically
valid
power
for
a
court
sitting
and
observing
events
in
its
presence,
which
events,
a
front
the
court
as
an
institution?
i
believe
that
such
a
court
is
qualified
to
pass
upon
the
facts
without
evidence,
without
further
evidence
and
that
which
he
has
already
heard.
i
think
they
are
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
your
honor
all
i
can
refer
to
is
the
sacher
case
in
the
first
instance
in
which
that
was
held
and
secondly
to
something
which
is
perhaps
not
as
explicit
as
it
might
be
in
panico
case.
the
panico
case
could
have
been
reversed
on
the
basis
of
facts
that
the
contempt
procedure
occurred
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
but
it
was
deferred,
but
it
was
not,
and
actually
the
substance
of
the
panico
decision
it
seems
to
be
would
apply
equally
well
whether
this
contempt
had
taken
place
immediately
or
later,
for
there,
there
was
indeed
an
affirmative
defense
of
insanity,
a
new
fact
which
would
not
have
been
in
the
knowledge
of
the
judge
who
was
sitting
at
the
trial
and
which
would
require
procedures
which
are
conventionally
associated
with
the
trial
of
an
issue.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
your
honor
i
should
say
he
is
and
for
this
reason.
there
is
a
difference
between
factors
affecting
intent
and
factors
affecting
malice
and
the
defense
of
insanity.
had
the
defendant
in
this
case
asserted
or
alleged
in
any
manner
to
the
court
that
he
was
not
competent
in
the
legal
sense,
that
he
was
no
capable
of
formulating
an
intent
for
conventional
reasons,
conventional
medical
psychiatric
reasons
then
i
should
say
that
an
issue
would
be
raised
which
would
require
the
taking
of
proof,
because
the
judge
would
not
be
qualified
to
deal
with
that
issue
on
the
basis
of
what
he
had
observed.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no,
not
at
all,
i
don't
and
i
don't
think
the
judge
ignored
it
here.
i
think
that
what
occurred
here
was
simply
this,
the
defendant
said,
your
honor,
i
was
over
worked,
i
was
emotionally
shaken
up,
he
told
the
judge
when
he
would
returned
by
the
way
that
afternoon
that
he
had
a
shot
and
that
he
was
feel
all
right
and
the
judge
sure
heard
this
explanation
and
accepted
it,
told
the
jury
he
had
a
shot
and
so
on.
at
the
conclusion
during
the
proceedings
here
by
the
way
which
were
quite
(inaudible)
whether
he
had
lawyer
or
not.
he
did
state
that
he
wanted
to
produce
medical
testimony
to
show
that
he
was
over,
emotionally
--
under
an
emotional
strain,
and
consequentially
the
outburst
was
in
effect
not
a
calculated
one
in
that
sense,
not
intentional
in
that
sense.
the
court
stated
to
him
i
will
take
that
into
consideration.
now
he
never
apologized,
he
never
apologized.
the
court
did
say,
as
to
apology
it's
something
which
the
court
might
take
into
consideration,
but
he
never
did
apologize
nor
did
he
ever
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
only
from
the
court
itself
your
honor,
i
think
you
will
find
that
the
court
said
as
to
apology
if
this
is
something
which
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
at
no
time
was
there
any
intent
on
my
part
to
do
or
say
anything
to
affront
the
dignity
of
the
court.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
never
intended.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
over
and
over
again
he
says
this
and
quite
clear
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
he
did
that
gave
it
a
more
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
technically
it
was
not
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact
an
apology
i
should
think
at
the
very
least
involves
an
admission
or
error
and
of
course
this
defendant
never
wants
at
any
point
the
proceedings
admitted
any
error
on
his
part,
but
merely
said
that
he
didn't
mean
to
have
such
an
outburst.
well,
i
think
we
can
fairly
say
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
nobody
intends
to
commit
a
contempt
in
the
sense
of
intents
to
put
himself
in
jail,
to
that
extent
i
think
that
you
don't
need
any
psychiatric
testimony.
the
question
here
was
what
was
the
effect
upon
this
act
of
his
mental
condition?
i
think
that
he
fully
stated
to
the
court
what
he
intended
to
prove
by
the
witness
and
i
think
that
the
court
indicated
that
it
fully
took
that
into
consideration.
however
i
think
the
court
very
rightly
said,
all
witnesses
are
in
under
some
strain
when
they
are
in
the
witness
stand,
i
saw
what
happened,
i
saw
what
lead
up
to
it,
i
followed
your
conduct
up
to
this
point,
and
i
can
appreciate
that
you
were
in
fact
distraught
and
so
forth,
but
to
my
way
of
thinking
although
this
is
some
--
had
some
effect
in
mitigation
perhaps
after
all
the
limit
here
was
30
days
that
he
could
have
imposed
and
he
may
very
well
have
mitigated
the
punishment
on
that
account.
i
think
the
court
very
rightly
felt
that
this
was
not
legal
justification
in
the
sense
of
proof
of
innocence.
to
sum
it
up
simply,
i
think
that
where
the
court
has
the
knowledge
upon
which
the
adjudication
is
based
then
the
conventional
processes
of
trial
are
not
--
the
great
values
that
we
normally
attribute
to
them.
when
we
say
that
the
right
to
confront,
to
cross
examine,
to
have
an
adjournment,
to
have
an
attorney
are
such
valued
things
in
this
system
of
law
and
justice
which
we
are
all
so
proud
of,
i
think
that
we
are
looking
at
them
not
as
ends
in
themselves
but
rather
as
means
to
assure
a
fair
result
and
i
think
that
where
there
are
alternate
means
then
there
is
a
second
and
adequate
justification
for
the
imposition
of
the
power
of
summary
contempt.
now
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
indeed
yeah.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
indeed.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
there
was
no
further
outburst
or
incident
the
extent
to
which
the
court
effectively
deterred
such
outburst
by
its
probe
statement
that
you
are
contemptuous.
now,
this
i
do
not
contend
that
this
was
an
adjudication
of
contempt,
but
i
think
it
is
a
far
clearer
indication
of
the
serious
manner
in
which
the
court
viewed
that
out
burst
and
perhaps
a
notice
at
least
of
a
sort
as
to
what
was
to
come.
i
think
that
the
effectiveness
of
that
immediate
statement
itself
provides
some
justification
for
summary
contempt
powers.
now,
there
has
been
considerable
said
here
and
written
in
the
past
about
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
court
was
actually
presiding
at
the
time
was
disqualified
by
the
very
rationale
which
i
have
offered.
there
was
of
course
a
time
when
juries
passed
upon
facts
based
upon
their
personal
knowledge
of
the
incident
and
the
time
came
when
disqualification
became
the
very
same
factor
as
it
was
previously
considered
qualification.
it
is
now
felt
that
a
jury
which
has
previous
knowledge
of
the
facts,
personal
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
disqualifies
him
from
sitting
at
a
trial,
shouldn't
the
same
reasoning
be
applied
to
the
judge.
i
have
said
the
justification
for
the
summary
power
that
exercised
in
a
differed
manner
is
the
judge's
knowledge
of
the
fact.
does
knowledge
of
the
facts
automatically
import
prejudice?
well,
it
has
been
said
by
this
court
that
every
contempt
of
court
in
the
immediate
view
in
presence
of
the
court
is
to
a
certain
extent
and
necessarily
an
attack
upon
the
judge
as
an
individual.
after
all
it
is
the
judge
who
is
responsible
for
the
order
in
the
court
and
the
identity
between
the
word
judge
and
court
on
a
trial
level
is
something
which
is
felt
by
all
in
the
courtroom.
is
it
then
so
that
on
no
occasion
where
we
constitutionally
assume
that
a
judge
has
the
detachment
to
deal
with
problems
of
disorder
in
the
courtroom,
which
he
is
assumed
to
have
in
the
exercise
of
so
many
other
his
duties.
i
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
we
cannot
make
such
an
assumption.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
in
his
case
has
indicated
that
they
feel
that
were
practicable,
it
would
be
the
better
procedure
for
a
judge
to
disqualify
himself
when
he
is
the
object
of
an
attack
and
i
would
be
the
first
to
agree
that
perhaps
it
is
indeed
the
better
practice.
this
court
indicated
in
the
offutt
case
that
they
had
shared
that
opinion,
but
i
don't
think
that
matters
the
issue
before
the
court
here.
it
is
not
the
question
of
whether
it
would
have
been
a
better
practice
or
whether
in
this
case
it
would
have
been
better
for
the
court
to
disqualify
himself.
here
the
question
is
was
there
a
violation
in
due
process
in
the
application
of
this
statute
by
reason
of
its
failure
to
do
so
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
that's
an
entirely
different
matter.
there
are
many
areas
of
discretion
whether
it
be
in
the
imposition
of
a
sentence
or
whether
it
be
in
the
granting
of
an
adjournment
which
has
great
effect
upon
the
outcome
of
a
case
and
which
are
felt
by
the
litigant
as
an
important
issue
in
the
case
and
yet
few
of
them,
few
of
them
rise
to
that
proportion
where
this
court
will
state
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
interpretation
that
there
has
been
a
lack
of
due
process
in
the
court's
decision,
choice.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well
i
should
say
judge
sarafite
has
been
on
the
bench
for
five
to
six
year
now
your
honor,
i'm
not
absolutely
certain.
he
was
chief
assistant
as
counsel
indicated
in
the
district
attorney's
office
since
the
days
of
thomas
(inaudible).
i
think
that
the
court
here
insofar
as
his
words
of
any
importance
in
this
matter
fully
indicated
that
he
himself
was
conscious
of
the
danger
of
sitting
in
judgment
one
a
case
in
which
he
had
been
present
at
the
incident
that
he
was
making
conscientious
efforts
and
i
think
that
the
record
is
replete
with
verification
of
how
conscientious
he
was
under
difficult
circumstances,
to
divorce
any
personal
feelings
from
his
judgment
of
the
of
affront
of
the
court.
he
stated
in
so
many
words
that
this
were
a
matter
between
us
as
individuals,
i
would
ignore,
but
i'm
charged
with
maintaining
the
dignity
of
the
court
in
which
i
preside
and
as
the
judge
in
the
court
i
must
be
able
to
divorce
myself
and
i
will
and
i
do
and
i
think
there
is
no
reason
for
believing
that
he
couldn't.
indeed
if
we
hold
otherwise
here
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
then
there
is
no
summary
contempt
instantly
imposed
either
for
certainly
the
court
if
he
acts
immediately
on
the
instant
when
the
affront
occurs
is
less
able
to
detach
himself
to
give
the
cool
reflection
and
reconsideration
for
the
incident
that
he
wouldn't
be
able
to
do
if
he
adopted
the
procedure
in
this
case.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
oh,
it
would
be
quite
different
than
this.
i
think
that's,
yes.
it
may,
it
may
come
on
the
second
branch
of
it.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
can't
see
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
don't
think
there
would
be
different
constitutional
rules
that
would
apply.
i
do
see
a
distinction,
certainly
those
matters
which
do
not
directly
tend
to
interrupt
the
proceedings
or
maybe
just
as
effectively
punished,
i
mean
dignity
of
the
court.
maybe
justice
effectively
maintained
by
some
procedure
which
is
more
in
the
nature
of
a
trial
or
more
plenary
procedure
whether
it'd
be
by
non
summary
contempt
or
by
indictment
for
a
crime.
nonetheless
i
do
not
think
that
they
would
be
--
that
the
two
are
mutually
exclusive.
i
do
think
that
a
matter
which
doesn't
interrupt
the
proceedings
but
does
detract
from
the
dignity
of
the
sitting
court
is
punishable
somehow
from
a
constitutional
stand
point
and
the
reason
is,
the
reason
that
i
gave.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well
i
am
relying
on
the
sacher
case
right
now.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
--
that's
my
understanding
of
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well
there
was
no
actual
interruption
in
the
sense
that
the
trial
--
there
was
interruption
by
harrying
and
colloquy
but
there
no
actual
interruption
in
the
sense
that
the
trial
was
ever
arrested
and
could
no
longer
proceed,
just
as
there
was
an
appeal
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well
may
i
avoid
that
question
at
least
to
this
extent
your
honor.
in
the
instant
case
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
question
at
all,
but
that
there
was
conduct
tending
to
interrupt
the
proceeding
of
the
court.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
as
far
as
the
dignity
of
the
court
is
concerned
i
would
say
that
the
same,
the
same
rationale
would
apply
and
that
is
that
the
court
as
a
witness
that
the
court
as
a
detached
witness
is
just
as
capable
of
making
an
adjudication
without
a
full
scale
trial
on
the
matter
of
dignity.
i
should
say
also
i
think
that
perhaps
there's
somewhat
unrealistic
line.
i
can
think
of
facts
which
will
be
almost
impossible
to
determine
whether
it
is
one,
or
the
other,
or
perhaps
a
bit
of
both
because
certainly
conduct
which
does
interrupt
the
trial
also
detracts
on
the
dignity
of
the
court.
and
frequently
abusive
conduct,
something
more
than
the
ordinary
heat
of
advocacy
would
in
addition
be
conduct
which
would
tend
to
interrupt
the
orderly
progress
of
the
trial.
i
don't
think
that
interruption
should
be
taken
so
literally
that
there
actually
has
to
be
the
death
of
a
jury
before
there
is
an
interruption.
i
think
interruption
means,
interruption
of
the
orderly
progress
withdrawal.
interruption
in
the
sense
that,
for
example
a
lawyer
refuses
to
confine
his
questions
to
proper
questions,
refuses
to
abide
by
rulings
of
the
court
directing
him
in
his
examination,
i
think
that
this
would
be
conduct
both
tending
to
interrupt
and
detracting
him
from
the
dignity
of
court.
after
all
obedience
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
if
we
hypothesize
a
pure
case
of
affront
to
dignity
in
which
there
is
no
interruption
at
all
and
yet
it
is
a
case
which
takes
place
in
immediate
view
and
presence
of
a
sitting
court
then
i
should
think
that
perhaps
it
would
be
better
for
the
judge
to
defer.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
i
think
it
would
be
better
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
still
think
he
would
have
the
power.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
–
well
you
are
not
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
not
infallible
--
but
it
was
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
it
wouldn't
be
your
honor,
because
actually
we
have
a
right
of
appeal
and
review
by
an
appellant
court
based
upon
matters
which
are
in
the
record
and
which
are
fully
described
in
a
mandate
and
that
review
by
appeal
to
me
is
always
been
the
safeguard
against
a
judge
--
trial
judge's
view
of
himself
as
infallible.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well
other
judges
have
appealed.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well
we
--
well
we
do
and
we
don't.
it's
reasonable
but
we
do
give
it,
yes.
this
is,
if
this
had
been
proceeded
--
this,
this
very
conduct
itself
probably
could
have
been
the
subject
of
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
and
if
so
there
would
be
have
been
a
trial.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well
i
will,
that
would
be
up
to
him,
i
consume
that
if
he
moved
for
a
jury
trial,
could
very
well
be
the
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
you
do,
you
do
have
to
move
forward.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
as
modified
to
this
extent.
and
if
he
had
received
a
jury
trial
in
this
case,
that
would
have
been
an
independent
fact
finder,
that
would
have
been
proof,
but
the
judge
himself
in
testifying
certainly
would
–
a
very
respected
witness
before
a
jury
and
if
it
had
not
been
a
jury
trial,
but
had
been
a
trial
before
another
judge,
i
think
that
it
maybe
some
what
unrealistic
to
assume
that
a
judge,
if
he
appears
as
a
witness
before
a
colleague,
would
be
any
more
discredited
then
if
he
passes
upon
the
fact
himself.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
while
he
was
actually
sitting
as
a
witness.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
am
actually
not
sure
but
in
the
actual
view
and
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
but
in
the
actual
view
and
presence
of
the
sitting
court,
we
may
import
something
on
someone
more
open
nature,
after
all
there
was
a
jury
here,
there
was
the
press,
public,
all
whom
saw
and
witnessed,
experienced
this
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
not
so
much
no
--
i
am
not
sure
that
the
outburst
would
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
trial.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
but
i
think
it
would
have
publically
offended
the
dignity
of
the
court
and
because
of
its
vocal
nature
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well
i
retire
from
that
point
then
and
say
that
it
would
have
tended
to
interrupt
the
proceedings
of
the
court.
well
in
a
matter
the
note
would
not
and
consequently
it's
quite
possible
that
it
might
not
come
within
the
purview
of
the
statute.
when
a
--
when
a
judge
is
addressed
by
note,
it
seems
to
me
it
might
very
well
be
said
that
he
is
being
addressed
in
a
private
capacity
that
he
is
not
being
addressed
as
a
presiding
official
in
the
court.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
i
would
like
to
come
finally
to
the
question
of
the
denial
of
the
adjournment.
this
denial
of
the
adjournment
in
the
procedure
itself
has
been
alleged
here
to
amount
to
a
denial
of
due
process
in
and
off
itself.
i
would
hate
to
think
that
this
court
was
devoting
all
it's
time
and
energy
and
effort
to
determine
the
question
of
whether
or
not
judge
abused
his
discretion
in
denying
this
application
for
an
adjournment,
but
then
of
course
i
hate
to
also
think
that
this
case
might
not
be
before
this
court
had
it
not
been
for
the
imposition
of
a
$250
fine
in
addition
to
the
prison
term,
but
that
is
the
contention
here
that,
that
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
but
i
submit
your
honor
that
at
least
i
could
argue
that
the
case
would
be
moved
had
it
not
been
for
the
$250
fine.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well,
that
may
very
well
be
so,
but
i
would
argue
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes,
but
i
would
argue
that
the
--
that
there
would
be
no
natural
result
flowing
as
far
as
disbarment
is
concerned
from
the
contempt,
that's
quiet
an
independent
proceeding.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that
i
suppose
is
the
issue
is
not
--
is
the
denial
of
this
adjournment,
the
same
thing
as
the
denial
of
adequate
opportunity
to
be
heard.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
as
basic
proposition
of
law
i
should
certainly
say
that
the
constitution
requires
an
adequate
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
to
defend
oneself
against
a
criminal
charge.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no.
but
i
do
say
that
in
this
instance
we
do
not
have
that
situation.
we
do
not
have
the
denial
of
an
adequate
opportunity
to
defend
oneself
against
the
criminal
charge.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that's
correct.
i
would
say
that
under
those
circumstances
he
was
entitled
to
the
adjournment,
because
i
think
under
those
circumstances
he
was
entitled
to
an
attorney
and
all
that
implies.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that's
correct
sir,
that's
correct.
first
because
it's
not
a
trial
and
second
because
it's
not
a
criminal
matter.
it
is
adjudication.
the
fact
has
already
been
established.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
he
goes
to
different
jails
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honor.
[attempt
to
laughter]
he
goes
to
the
jail
with
all
the
fellows
who
haven't
their
alimony.
he
went
to
the
civil
jail.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
some
further
indication
to
the
fact
that
although
whether
this
is
criminal
or
civil
maybe
somewhat
confused
in
new
york,
certainly
there
are
many
aspects
of
it,
which
are
civil,
although
it
is
denominated
criminal
contempt,
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
essential
distinction
is
this
is
not
a
trial
and
that
a
lawyer
is
not
required
for
a
man
to
make
an
excuse,
for
a
man
to
give
a
factor,
an
extenuation.
certainly
in
this
instance
it
is
perfectly
evident
from
this
record
that
no
lawyer
could
have
done
more
for
sidney
ungar
than
he
did
for
himself.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
there
are
many
things
at
sentence
which
a
lawyer
can
do,
which
the
lawyer
could
not
do
here.
he
can
make
motions
to
set
aside,
he
can
make
motions
and
arrest
of
judgment,
which
in
new
york
are
quiet
tactical.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
not.
first,
as
to
the
first
thing,
filing
of
paper
that
it
should
had
been
heard
before
a
different
judge.
this
court
does
not
put
a
lot
of
stress
on
the
filing
of
papers
from
the
courts
of
new
york
and
the
defendant
orally
made
that
motion
to
the
court,
so
his
rights
to
that
extent
were
fully
preserved,
if
the
motion
was
made
it
was
denied,
it
was
reviewed
by
the
appellate
courts.
secondly
as
to
the
necessity
to
proceed
before
a
second
judge
in
a
case
of
this
sort,
the
matters
of
disqualification
were
fully
discussed
by
this
defendant
himself.
consequently
i
don't
think
that
a
lawyer
could
be
proceeded
in
any
way
more
adequately
than
he
did.
on
the
question
of
the
stead,
this
is
important,
because
one
matter
that
has
not
yet
been
mentioned
here,
is
what
was
the
alleged
purpose
of
the
request?
certainly
the
lawyer
said
i'm
engaged,
certainly
ungar
said
he
needs
an
adjournment,
but
for
what
specifically
did
he
need
that
adjournment,
what
did
he
say
he
needed
the
adjournment
for?
what
he
said
he
needed
the
adjournment
for
was
to
test
the
legality
of
these
proceedings
by
a
writ
presumably
in
the
appellate
division
and
as
he
said
if
necessary
in
the
court
of
appeals.
in
other
words,
what
he
wished
to
do,
during
this
adjournment
was
not
produce
evidence,
nothing
relating
to
the
preparation
of
the
trial
of
the
issue
so
to
speak,
but
try
and
have
the
appeal
of
the
issue
adjudicated
in
advance
by
writ.
that
i
submit
was
considered
by
the
court
as
one
of
the
reasons
for
denying
the
request
of
adjournment
and
i
submit
further
that
it
was
a
perfectly
reasonable
disposition
of
the
request.
in
all
probability
had
there
been
a
petition
for
a
writ
in
advance
in
the
nature
of
a
writ
of
prohibition,
it
would
have
been
denied
as
premature,
normally
matters
of
the
legality
of
the
proceeding
are
reviewed
on
appeal
after
the
adjudication.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
there
is
no
evidence
to
be
expressed.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
for
that
there
is
a
statutory
motion
to
be
made
in
advance
in
that
instance.
as
far
as
the
stay
is
concerned
i
might
go
further
and
say
that
after
this
adjudication,
this
also
has
not
been
referred
to
here,
but
after
this
adjudication
there
were
numerous
obligations
to
several
courts
in
new
york
for
a
stay
of
the
judgment
imposed
by
judge
sarafite.
there
were
motions
for
certificates
of
reasonable
doubt,
there
were
applications
and
petitions
for
prohibitions
and
certioraris,
during
the
ten
days
that
he
actually
served
and
at
that
time
he
was
in
jail,
he
was
represented
by
several
lawyers
seeking
every
possible
available
means
of
staying
the
execution
of
the
judgment
until
it
could
be
tested.
it
was
unsuccessful
in
that
regard,
but
i
submit
that
the
use
of
these
procedures
is
very
a
valuable
indicia
of
the
fairness
of
the
procedure
and
again
of
the
lack
of
necessity
to
grant
an
adjournment
in
order
to
accomplish
the
same
thing
in
advance
of
the
adjudication.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
they
were
according
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
mr.
justice
white.
actually
the
only
way
we
can
tell
for
sure
is
because
in
new
york
there
are
alternative
means
of
review,
one
appropriate
–
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no
it
would
have
to
have
been
clear.
actually
the
statutes
self
says
maybe
punished
summarily
if
it's
in
the
immediate
due
and
presence
of
the
court,
it
doesn't
say
it
has
to
be.
i
think
that
if
the
court
had
done
that,
the
court
appearing
as
a
witness,
others
appearing
as
a
witness
before
a
colleague,
i
think
in
all
likelihood
the
result
will
be
the
same
since
the
credibility
of
this
particular
judge
is
not
bad,
but
whether
it
would
have
been
or
not
i
think
the
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
the
procedures
would
have
been
very
different
and
i
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
that
the
counsel
should
be
afforded.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
not
in
new
york
at
the
present
time
no,
in
the
present
time
jury
trial
is
right
in
new
york
only
in
crimes
and
i
think
that
even
a
plenary
contempt
procedure
is
not
considered
a
trial
of
a
crime.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well
one
thing
i
think
that
there
would
have
to
be
the
right
to
cross-examination,
the
right
to
counsel.
judge
sarafite
would
have
to
testify
and
be
subject
to
cross
examination.
the
right
to
call
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
exactly.
there
was
a
full
courtroom,
it
may
very
well
be
the
jurors
who
were
strategically
placed
from
the
standpoint
of
opportunity
to
observe
and
hear
these
events
might
have
to
be
called
as
witnesses
or
subject
to
examination.
i
can
foresee
really
quite
an
extensive
trial
in
view
of
the
number
of
witnesses
in
order
to
establish
the
fact
that
one,
there
was
a
loud
and
disorderly
noise
made
by
this
man
and
two
that
the
facts
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
utterance
was
such
that
the
intent
to
disrupt
the
proceedings
was
manifest
from
these
actions.
in
addition
thereto
there
might
possibly
have
been
matters
offered
if
not
in
actual
defense,
at
least
in
mitigation
from
the
standpoint
of
his
own
testimony,
i'm
sure
that
he
would
take
the
opportunity
as
he
did
in
his
extensive
affidavits
on
appeal
in
this
case
to
show
why
he
thought
that
hulan
jack
was
innocent
and
why
he
thought
that
hulan
jack
was
not
getting
a
fair
trial
in
order
to
give
as
he
was
very
anxious
to
do,
to
give
a
public
airing
to
his
view
of
the
facts,
which
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
no,
jack
was
convicted,
he
was
convicted,
he
was
acquitted
of
some
counts,
but
he
was
convicted
of
the
underlying
count
in
his
trial.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well
i
thank
you
for
that
mr.
justice
black.
i
wonder
whether
that
implies
also
that
immediacy
is
the
only
justification.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
factually
certainly
this
case
is
extremely
close
to
the
sacher
case,
both
in
the
nature
of
the
difficulties
with
the
--
in
that
case
the
lawyer,
in
this
case
the
witness,
and
the
difficulties,
the
problems
that
was
imposed
for
the
continuation
of
an
orderly
trial.
i
think
that
it
was
with
the
sacher
case
in
mind
that
the
court
adopted
this
particular
procedure,
because
of
the
closeness
of
the
facts.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
well
your
honor
has
termed
the
contempt
power,
an
anomaly
in
law.
i
can
only
say
in
response
to
that
how
much
anomalies
would
it
be
if
the
court
had
the
power
to
jail
a
man
instantly
and
without
any
written
charges
or
opportunity
to
think,
and
in
the
heat
of
the
moment,
but
could
not
exercise
the
same
power.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
that
--
i
fully
recognize
it
and
i
certainly
think
that
limitation
has
to
be
placed
on
this
extraordinary
power,
but
i
stress
to
the
court,
that
all
of
the
effects
of
the
delay
in
exercise
on
this
power
accrued
to
the
benefit
of
this
appellant,
he
had
written
charges,
he
never
would
have
had
them
before,
they
are
clear
and
explicitly,
they
set
forth
not
only
in
the
contempt
itself
which
he
was
ultimately
convicted
of,
but
they
set
forth
all
of
the
instances
that
proceeded
it,
which
gave
rise
to
the
court's
belief
that
he
intended
to
disrupt.
he
was
given
not
only
five
days
to
read
the
charges
themselves
which
after
all
is
considerable
for
an
attorney,
whether
it
snowed
or
not,
but
he
was
in
addition
warned
very
clearly
when
he
left
the
stand
that
this
would
be
the
action
of
the
court.
on
none
of
these
benefits
of
time
would
have
been
his
had
the
court
exercised
the
acknowledged
power
to
punish
him
instantly.
in
addition
thereto
the
court
itself
had
an
opportunity,
very
important
opportunity,
to
reflect
in
the
coolest
of
the
cessation
of
hostility,
if
you
will,
after
the
trial
has
been
complete
upon
the
acts
that
were
perpetrated
in
his
presence
and
upon
their
significance.
to
reflect
upon
the
proceeding
experience
which
he
had
had
with
this
particular
witness
in
the
two
trials
and
whether
or
not
this
did
indicate
a
contumacious
attitude
had
appeared
to
him
at
the
moment.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
that's
correct,
it
did.
as
a
matter
of
fact
–
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
quite
thoroughly
yes.
actually
this
was
purely
a
construction
of
the
federal
rule
42a
and
42b.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
however,
i
think
that
justice
jackson
in
discussing
the
nature
of
the
power
which
was
embodied
in
that
rule
went
somewhat
beyond
the
limited
question
on
which
certiorari
was
originally
granted.
i
should
like
to
point
out
one
other
thing
before
i
sit
down
and
that
is
simply
this.
the
sacher
case
made
the
point
that
there
is
wisdom
in
the
deferment
of
punishment
under
certain
circumstances,
and
i
would
like
to
relate
that
doctrine
if
i
can
for
a
moment
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
not
only
was
this
witness
in
the
middle
of
his
testimony
at
the
time
that
this
out
burst
occurred,
not
only
was
he
required
further
as
a
witness
which
would
have
made
it
extremely
difficult
to
punish
him,
but
had
it
been
done
in
the
absence
of
a
jury,
i
do
not
think
that
we
can
say
that
there
would
have
been
no
effect
on
the
trial
from
the
defendant
standpoint.
first
this
court
has
indicated
that
an
adjudication
of
contempt
should
not
be
done
in
secret
that
it
must
be
a
public
proceeding.
this
was
a
highly
publicized
trial.
if
the
jury
did
not
hear
about
it
directly,
they
likely
would
have
heard
about
it
indirectly.
secondly,
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
jury
would
have
had
to
have
been
informed
that
this
witness
had
been
adjudicated
in
contempt
because
it
was
a
factor
certainly
affecting
his
credibility
as
a
witness.
in
addition
it
may
have
had
a
very
deleterious
effect
open
the
bias
of
the
witness.
had
this
man
been
adjudicated
in
contempt
and
the
punishment
deferred,
he
might
very
well
have
then
slanted
his
testimony
thereafter,
abandoned
his
friendship
for
hulan
jack
once
in
for
all
and
become
if
anything
an
overly
cooperative
witness
for
the
people
to
the
defendant's
determent.
and
finally
any
further
witnesses
who
might
have
been
called
by
the
people
might
themselves
had
been
pressured
or
intimidated
by
the
fact
that
a
previous
witness
was
held
in
contempt
on
the
stand
and
have
been
overly
favorable
to
the
district
attorney
or
overly
cooperative
with
the
prosecution.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
yes
it
could
have
been,
but
i
think
that
that
would
have
been
an
--.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
as
a
matter
of
fact
that's
what
he
told
the
judge
at
the
time
of
his
procedure
itself.
he
said
that's
what
you
should
have
done
or
could
have
done
in
this
case
but
since
you
didn't
do
it,
now
you
have
no
power
over
me
that
was
for
sum
and
substance
of
his
plea
to
the
court.
but
i
submit
that
although
the
court
could
have,
i
think
that
it
would
have
been
a
very
unwise
thing
for
the
court
to
have
done.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
believe
so,
no
sentence
normally
deferred
after
the
adjudication
in
a
trial.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
actually
i
would
say
as
a
factual
matter
not
to
get
too
technical
about
that
in
effect
what
was
done
here,
because
the
court
did
say
you
are
contemptuous
and
then
when
the
proceeding
occurred
the
court
in
effect
merely
asked
him
whether
he
had
anything
to
say
before
sentence
was
imposed
upon
him.
so
--
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
not
at
all
justice
goldberg,
not
at
all,
i
do
not
see,
i
do
not
see
why
the
mere
fact
that
the
adjudication
can
be
deferred
and
in
fact
should
be
deferred
that
the
contempt
was
not
one
which
tended
to
interrupt
the
proceedings
of
the
court.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i'm
sorry.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
i
think
it
would
be
if
you
are
viewing
the
two
justice
goldberg
as
inconsistent,
that
the
same
contempt
could
not
be
at
the
same
time
one
that
affronts
the
dignity
of
the
court
and
one
which
interrupts
proceedings
or
intends
to
interrupt.
mr.
h.
richard
uviller
so
in
conclusion
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
the
sacher
case
is
still
good
law
that
the
principles
there,
so
thoroughly
examined,
control
this
case.
i
suggest
that
the
court
in
wisely
deferring
this
adjudication
did
not
lose
the
power
which
he
indisputably
had
at
the
outset
and
i
think
that
by
reason
of
the
benefits
that
were
accorded
to
this
defendant
from
the
deferment,
it
has
not
become
constitutionally
entitled
to
greater
benefits.
thank
you.
