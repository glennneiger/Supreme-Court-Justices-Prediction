what
you
are
saying
the
fact
is
that
under
the
constitution
where
a
man
is
charged
with
an
offence
for
which
he
can
go
to
jail,
in
this
case
ten
days
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
you
are
asking
us
to
do
is
say
this
reaches
constitutional
proportion,
this
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
trial
judge.
justice
tom
c.
clark
there
will
be
many
here
--
he
knew
on
saturday
his
lawyer
was
going
to
be
engaged
in
another
trial,
and
still
he
didn't
make
any
effort
as
far
as
the
record
shows
of
getting
another
lawyer.
