justice
potter
stewart
apology,
who
apologized
to
whom
and
about
what?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
fraenkel,
the
papers
to
which
you
referred,
so
that's
the
order
to
show
cause,
which
appears
at
the
record
beginning
at
page
67?
justice
potter
stewart
and
goes
on
into
about
page
91
i
think.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
that
basically
consist
of
is
a
excerption
of
mr.
ungar's
own
testimony
at
the
trial,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
with
which
of
course
he
was
perfectly
familiar?
justice
potter
stewart
i
quite
agree
but
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
it,
it
was
just
portion
of
the
transcript
of
his
testimony.
justice
potter
stewart
well
now
yes,
but
now
what
would
have
been
accomplished
if
nobody
could
have
suffered
any
harm,
what
good
would
have
been
accomplished
during
the
adjournment?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
a
gideon's
case
now
mr.
fraenkel?
justice
potter
stewart
well
he
had
the
advice
of
counsel,
did
he
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
still
not
quite
clear
on
what
the
factors
are
on
the
other
side,
of
what
rights
or
of
what
opportunities
was
the
petitioner
denied.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
i
mean
not
quite
specifically,
all
these
charges
amounted
to
what
he
had
said
as
a
witness
at
the
preceding
criminal
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
question
about
the
fact
that
he
did
say
it.
justice
potter
stewart
now
i'm
looking
at
the
transcript
here
and
the
record
from
page
93
to
111
all
of
it
was
brought
to
the
court's
attention,
it
had
all
happened
in
an
open
court,
you
have
seen
it
and
heard
it.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
an
offer
of
medical
proof
in
page
111,
all
of
these
things,
i
just
wonder
what
opportunities
were
denied
to
him?
justice
potter
stewart
sometimes
it's
much
more
effective.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
claim
or
haven't
claimed
to-date
that
the
denial
of
that
request
was
a
denial
of
any
constitutional
right,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well
apart
from
the
fact
that
the,
facts
were
quite
different
in
the
panico
case.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
believe
that
could
be
argued,
he
was
in
an
institution
mr.
panico,
but
at
the
hindsight,
the
point
is
that
of
due
process
at
all
that
was
in
the
federal
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
involved
the
supervisory
power
of
this
court,
it
wasn't
a
due
process
case.
justice
potter
stewart
on
page
105
and
on
page
107,
on
page
105
in
the
paragraph
at
about
the
middle
of
the
page
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
--
technically
it's
not
an
apology,
but
a
quote
as
to
that
which
--
and
on
page
104
the,
next
to
last
paragraph
on
the
page,
i'm
satisfied
in
my
own
mind
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
never
intended
to
commit
a
contempt
of
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
suppose
that
to
which
the
court
referred
in
speaking
of
an
apology
in
the
last
paragraph
on
page
107
--
justice
potter
stewart
although
it
was
not
technically
an
apology.
justice
potter
stewart
the
sacher
case
wasn't
decided
on
any
constitutional
ground,
was
it?
it
was
â€“
it
involved
a
construction
of
rule
42a
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
justice
potter
stewart
the
descent
talked
about
constitutional
consideration.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
new
york
procedure
could
he
have
been
found
guilty
of
contempt
in
the
middle
of
the
trial
and
his
--
and
sentence
deferred
--.
justice
potter
stewart
well
like
you
say
your
point
is
that
would
have
been
a
--
that's
a
very
undesirable
thing.
justice
potter
stewart
sentence
could
have
been
deferred.
justice
potter
stewart
well
because
that's
an
opportunity
for
a
--
at
least
to
the
federal
system
for
a
pre-sentence
investigation.
