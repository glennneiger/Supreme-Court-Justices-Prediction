(inaudible)
justice

black
so
that
the
basis
on
which
they
affirmed
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
what
connection
what
claim
did
they
refer
to
the
thing
if
this
was
not
a
personal
attack?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
to
support
their
holding
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
different
judge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
said
that
court
of
appeals
held
an
appellant
contemptuous
remark
when
none
would
contempt
none
of
us
protected
the
trial
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
did
he
say
what
the
chief
judge
ryan
(inaudible)
to
the
judge?
was
that
--
did
he
make
that
remark
to
the
judge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
he
say
to
the
court
which
the
court
said
was
contemptuous?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
asked
you
what
he
said
to
the
court
that
court
held
contemptuous.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
next
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
next?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
--
is
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
was
not
a
personal
attack
on
a
judge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
shouted
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
keep
the
court
from
being
interrupted,
that
basis,
provided
that
is
the
basis
for
disappearance
right
after
the
trial
was
over.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
time
to
time,
have
from
time
to
time,
have
they
not
if
the
judge
waited
until
the
trial
was
over,
looked
to
see
if
the
attack
was
so
personal
that
judge
should
not
sit
on
it
and
remanded
it
for
trial
by
different
judge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
this
man
had
told
him
an
unspeakable
name
and
he
waited
until
the
case
was
over,
that
they
ought
to
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
record
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
outstanding
rule
in
that
court
that
not
effective,
it
should
leave
the
court
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
a
rule
enforced
by
this
judge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
although
that
rule
--
there
was
no
such
general
rule
in
the
other
courtrooms?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
what,
for
spectators
to
leave?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
second?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
in
one
or
two
cases,
may
be
i
am
wrong,
that
we
had
referred
to
the
first
case
that
ever
held
of
the
judge,
five
men
punished
with
contempt
of
court,
summarily
and
explained
that
as
(inaudible)
according
to
the
language
in
that
first
case,
that
if
it
only
do
that
when
it
would
interrupt
the
proceedings
of
the
court
if
it
didn't
act
at
once.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
it
had
been
held
one
or
two
cases
if
that
were
not
true,
unless
the
--
what
the
man
did
was
necessarily
to
do
that
at
the
time
to
prevent
further
interruption
of
the
court
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
has
held
punish
the
consent
--
contempt
on
the
ground
that
something
is
said
may
detract
from
the
dignity
of
the
court.
what
case
are
you
referring?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
say
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
was
based
on
the
fact
that
they
interrupted
the
court's
procedure
to
act
fair
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
there
has
long
been
a
--
many
discussions
–
commentators
have
discussed
how
contempt
and
most
of
them
at
least
in
recent
years
have
said
that
now
we
are
not
saying
that
court
can
punish
the
contempt
because
the
court
thinks
its
dignity
is
affected,
that's
what
the
most
(inaudible)
have
grown
out
of
it
connection
with
contempt
and
that
–
both
the
courts
and
commentators
have
abandoned
in
such
argument
a
long
time
ago.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
actually
that
is
a
different
word
of
connection
with
contempt
and
has
been
throughout
the
years
judges
get
the
sense
of
it,
and
they
think
their
dignity
is
offended
because
i
thought
that
all
the
commentators
and
cases
had
lot
of
sense
to
tie
it
inevitably
the
whole
idea
which
will
allow
the
judge
who
thinks
his
dignity
has
been
hurt,
can
just
(inaudible)
man
up
and
punish
him
for
contempt.
i
understand
the
interruption,
that's
quite
a
different
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
to
be
better.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
you'd
still
have
the
right
to
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
try
them
at
the
right
of
the
hearing,
try
them
–
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
somebody
else
in
the
courtroom
had
seen
it
differently.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
be
that
the
court
statement
to
be
taken
as
infallible
that
all
happened
and
all
the
inferences
could
be
drawn
from
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
can
say
my
dignity
has
been
offended?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
–
that's
by
other
judges?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
you,
but
i
thought
your
state
gave
a
jury
trial.
i
thought
your
state
gave
a
jury
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
man
would
have
had
then,
what
kind
of
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
are
asking
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
your
constitution
provides
for
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
as
merely
to
offend
the
personal
sensitiveness
of
the
judge,
but
in
prejudice
to
expeditious
orders
and
(inaudible).
several
other
cases
are
cited
in
your
brief,
which
we
decided,
which
drew
the
distinction
pointed
out
that
the
original
(inaudible)
and
others
that
have
followed
it
limited
the
trial
to
terro
case
and
the
cook
case
and
other
that
have
followed
it
limited
(inaudible)
there
was
actual
--
actually
something
took
place
in
the
presence
of
this
court
that
interrupted
the
orderly
process
of
this
court,
that
it
couldn't
go
on
unless
you
punished
them
immediately,
i
think
we've
had
several
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
the
sacher
case
held
different
to
that,
that's
right.
the
sacher
case
held
that
immediacy
was
--
measured
up
to
the
standards
where
you
can
try
to
submit
it
at
the
beginning,
you
could
try
and
submit
it
after
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
standards
of
what
constitutes
--
which
can
be
punished
summarily?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
number
of
courts
have
--
seem
to
think
that
sacher
opened
up
the
door
to
wait
until
the
case
is
over,
punish
a
man
under
all
circumstances
summarily
but
i
think
a
careful
reading
of
the
sacher
case
could
demonstrate
that
it
did
not
justify
any
such
conclusion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
raising
the
question
as
whether
this
was
enough
to
punish
him
because
it
made
you
up
to
the
standard
of
consequences
that
occur
without
bringing
about
summary
punishment
denying
a
man
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
and
all
the
other
procedurals,
that's
the
difference.
