mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
may
i
please
the
court.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
mr.
fraenkel.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no
mr.
fraenkel.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes
sir.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
mr.
redfield
is
going
to
deal
with
the
legal
questions
primarily
and
i
will
relate
the
circumstances
under
which
the
case
arose.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
summary
contempt
conviction
of
a
witness
at
a
criminal
trial
in
the
city
of
new
york.
the
conviction
took
place
sometime
after
the
conclusion
of
the
trial.
the
trial
itself
was
that
of
former
borough
president
of
manhattan,
hulan
jack.
mr.
jack
was
charged
with
conspiracy
and
this
witness,
appellant
here,
was
named
as
a
coconspirator,
but
was
not
indicted.
the
charge
was
generally
that
mr.
jack
had
received
favors
from
persons
who
might
have
benefited
in
connection
with
official
duties
performed
by
mr.
jack.
one
of
those
charges
involved
this
appellant
although
mr.
jack
was
ultimately
acquitted
of
that
particular
charge.
appellant,
a
lawyer
and
engaged
in
real
estate
business
ventures
had
for
many
years
been
an
intimate
personal
friend
of
mr.
jack's
and
a
close
political
associate.
he
was
convinced
of
mr.
jack's
innocence.
he
was
called
by
the
prosecution
after
having
testified
at
length
before
the
grand
jury
and
during
the
first
trial,
because
the
first
trial
resulted
in
a
disagreement
and
this
occurrence
which
is
the
subject
of
this
appeal
was
at
the
second
trial,
during
the
first
trial
differences
arose
between
mr.
ungar
as
a
witness
and
the
prosecuting
attorney
mr.
scotti
and
the
judge
and
i
might
note
parenthetically
that
mr.
scotti
and
the
judge
had
been
close
associates
in
the
district
attorney's
office
before
the
judge
ascended
the
bench
and
as
a
result
mr.
ungar
was
treated
as
a
hostile
witness.
it
also
developed
during
the
first
trial
that
the
defendant's
attorney
mr.
baker
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
he
claims
he
was
not,
the
judge
ruled
that
he
was
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
he
had
originally
asked
for
immunity.
he
then
sought
to
withdraw
that
immunity
unsuccessfully.
in
any
case
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no
and
of
course
he
was,
he
admittedly
believed
that
the
defendant
was
innocent.
difficulties
arose
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
i
am
taking
from
the
record
of
course
there
is
a
statement
to
that
effect
of
whether
in
fact
he
was
or
was
not,
may
not
really
be
relevant
to
this
case
now
before
your
honors,
difficulties
arose.
during
the
interval
between
the
first
and
the
second
trials,
mr.
ungar
addressed
first
a
letter
and
then
a
motion
to
the
trial
judge
who
was
the
same
at
both
trials
asking
that
he
be
treated
as
the
court's
witness
because
he
said
he
had
experienced
difficulty
during
the
first
trial
in
giving
his
understanding
of
the
fact
and
felt
that
he
was
whipsawed
between
the
prosecutor
and
the
defense
attorney,
the
defense
attorney
apparently
taking
to
position
that
mr.
jack's
difficulties
stemmed
from
his
connection
with
appellant.
that
request
was
turned
down
and
the
second
trial
commenced
and
mr.
ungar
was
a
witness
for
several
days
and
further
difficulties
–
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
the
prosecution,
this
is
all
--
he
was
called
both
times
only
by
the
prosecution.
certain
other
difficulties
arose
primarily
because
mr.
ungar
wanted
to
give
fuller
versions
of
conversations
which
had
occurred
between
him
and
mr.
jack
that
apparently
the
prosecutor
was
interested
in
developing.
it
reached
a
point
on
the
third
or
fourth
day
of
this
testimony
when
mr.
ungar
became
emotionally
disturbed
and
asked
the
court
to
be
allowed
to
step
down
for
a
brief
time
because
he
said
he
was
so
upset
that
he
couldn't
continue
to
give
testimony.
that
request
was
repeated
two
or
three
times
and
each
time
denied
and
then
came
the
outburst
which
is
the
basis
of
the
contempt
charge,
which
i
suppose
must
be
stated
verbatim
and
again
asking
to
be
excused,
the
judge
having
denied
it
before,
mr.
ungar
continued
and
in
the
disturbed
state
to
say,
i
am
absolutely
unfit
to
testify
because
of
your
honor's
attitude
and
conduct
toward
me.
i'm
being
coerced
and
intimated
and
badgered,
the
court
is
suppressing
the
evidence
and
then
followed
a
very,
very
unusual
situation,
the
defense
attorney
–
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
disagreement.
the
defense
attorney
then
suggested
that
perhaps
mr.
ungar
should
be
examined
by
a
physician
to
find
out
whether
he
was
emotionally
upset
or
whether
he
was
malingering
and
the
court
volunteered
the
statement
that
this
was
malingering
of
the
worst
kind
i
have
ever
seen.
and
then
the
court
retired
to
consider
whether
or
not
to
act
on
the
defense
attorney's
application
and
the
jury
was
excused
and
mr.
ungar
remained
seated
in
the
witness
stand
for
some
little
time.
the
judge
came
back
and
said
he
hadn't
been
able
to
make
up
his
mind
and
then
a
few
more
minutes
elapsed
and
finally
the
judge
said,
well
we
might
as
well
all
go
to
lunch
without
ruling
on
the
request.
during
the
lunch
period
mr.
ungar
went
to
nearby
hospital
and
received
medication.
he
returned
at
the
end
of
the
lunch
period.
the
judge
then
announced
after
being
reminded
by
the
defense
attorney
that
his
application
had
not
been
passed
on
and
it
was
denied.
mr.
ungar
continued
to
testify
for
a
day
or
more
and
there
was
no
further
difficulty
or
incident.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes,
the
judge
asked
him
whether
he
was
ready
to
proceed
and
mr.
ungar
said
yes,
having
gone
to
the
hospital
and
receiving
medication,
he
now
felt
composed
and
was
able
to
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes,
that's
right.
now
i
wish
to
also
point
out
that
the
judge
had
on
one
or
two
occasions
had
monished
mr.
ungar
and
that
at
the
end
of
the
trial
he
told
mr.
ungar
to
stay
around.
the
trial
ended
late
in
november
and
on
the
thursday
following
around
4:30
in
the
afternoon
mr.
ungar
was
served
with
fairly
luminous
papers
requiring
his
appearance
before
the
judge
on
the
following
tuesday
morning
charging
him
with
contempt,
reciting
a
number
of
incidents
which
had
occurred
during
the
trial,
but
specifying
primarily
the
matter
to
which
i
alluded
and
which
i
quoted.
mr.
ungar
appeared
in
court
on
tuesday
with
the
clerk
of
a
lawyer
whom
he
had
in
the
meantime
retained,
but
who
was
however
engaged
in
a
trial
in
another
part
of
the
court,
asking
for
a
brief
adjournment
so
that
this
lawyer
could
prepare
and
represent
him.
the
judge
required
that
the
lawyer
himself
appear
and
the
lawyer
was
able
to
arrange
with
the
judge
in
the
other
part
for
a
short
adjournment
of
an
hour
or
two
of
his
case
and
came
before
the
respondent
here
asking
for
an
adjournment
so
that
he
could
prepare.
it
should
be
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
oh
no
there
is
no
dispute
about
that
at
all,
no
question
about
that.
i
was
also
going
to
note
because
it
is
in
the
record
that
the
judge
made
some
emphasis
upon
it,
that
at
the
time
when
mr.
ungar
retained
this
lawyer,
the
lawyer
told
him
that
he
was
engaged
and
that
he
would
hope
to
get
an
adjournment
so
that
he
could
represent
mr.
ungar.
i
should
also
add
that
in
addition
to
this
being
over
a
weekend,
the
monday
preceding
the
tuesday
appearance
in
court
was
the
day
of
one
of
the
heaviest
snowfalls
of
recent
years
when
new
york
was
practically
incapacitated,
the
courts
closed,
the
schools
closed,
nothing
happened.
the
judge
after
listening
to
the
lawyer
for
some
few
moments,
several
pages
of
the
record
in
any
case,
denied
the
request.
the
judge
then
proceeded
to
introduce
into
evidence
stenographic
minutes,
various
things
that
had
occurred,
enquired
of
respondent
whether
he
wanted
to
go
on
and
respondent
said
that
he
felt
helpless
and
did
however
make
some
comments
upon
the
situation
including
an
apology
and
protested
against
the
judge
proceeding
in
the
manner
in
which
he
had
proceeded,
contempt
adjudication.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
mr.
ungar
said
to
the
court,
that
he
had
not
intended
to
commit
any
contempt,
that
he
was
such
in
emotional
state
that
he
didn't
know
what
he
was
doing
and
he
said
--
well
i
think
it
was
the
lawyer
who
apologized
on
his
behalf.
i
don't
find
at
the
moment.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yeah
i
should,
i
thought
i
brought
it.
there
is
a
word
apology
in
there
somewhere.
yes
on
page
107,
the
court
referred
to
--
no
oh
here
it
is.
well,
the
court
evidently
thought
that
the
statement
on
page
104,
i'm
satisfied
in
my
own
mind
that
i
never
intended
to
commit
any
contempt
of
court.
i
believe
i
can
satisfy
and
prove
that
there
was
never
any
intent
on
my
part
to
do
any
act
which
was
contemptuous,
disorderly
or
insolent
and
the
court
evidently
took
that
to
be
an
apology,
because
at
page
107
in
the
last
paragraph,
the
court
says
as
to
an
apology,
i
should
say
so
forth,
any
court
should
acknowledge
it
and
so
on.
in
any
case
thereupon
under
new
york
law,
the
apparently
appropriate
way
to
review
a
conviction
of
this
sort
is
not
by
an
appeal,
but
by
what
we
call
there
an
article
78
proceeding
which
is
an
amalgam
of
the
former
mandamus
certiorari
and
probation
procedures,
because
the
appeal
that
was
taken
is
dismissed
and
the
other
was
referred
on
it's
merits
and
affirmed,
then
it
ultimately
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york,
the
appellate
division
having
affirmed
without
any
opinion
and
the
court
of
appeals
likewise
affirmed
without
any
opinion,
but
in
it's
order
of
affordance
made
the
rather
remarkable
statement.
however,
we
point
out,
that's
at
156,
that
where
the
alleged
contempt
consists
of
the
making
of
charges
of
wrong
doing
by
the
trial
judge
himself,
he
should
where
disposition
of
the
contempt
charge
can
be
withheld
until
after
the
trial
and
where
it
is
otherwise
practicable
or
to
the
contempt
proceeding
to
be
tried
before
a
different
judge.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
there
was
a
request
--
there
was
an
objection
originally
to
the
judge
having
heard
the
matter
himself,
yes.
now
when
the
usual
formal
application
was
made
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
to
amend
its
remittitur
so
as
to
set
forth
the
constitutional
--
federal
constitutional
questions
had
been
raised,
there
having
been
no
opinion
from
the
court
discussing
these
and
in
that
order
amending
the
remittitur,
three
points
were
set
forth
as
having
been
raised
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
court's
refusal
to
grant
an
adjournment,
the
court's
in
vocation
of
summary
power
and
proceeding
before
the
judge
who
made
the
charge.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no.
that's
not
present
in
this
case.
and
then
again
the
court
did
something
quite
unusual
in
this
order
amending
the
remittitur,
the
court
perhaps
seeking
to
undercut
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
cases
like
(inaudible)
went
on
to
say
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
appellant's
contemptuous
remarks
were
not
a
personal
attack
upon
the
trial
judge
and
that
in
no
way
was
it
--
of
any
--
of
course
the
formal
thing
that
it
was
no
way
a
denial
of
any
constitutional
rights.
now
that
statement
of
course
of
the
court
of
appeals
interpreting
the
remarks
we
submit
is
not
conclusive
upon
this
court,
because
that
is
entangled
with
the
constitutional
question
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
matter
proceeding
before
the
same
judge.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
was
quoting
from
page
165
of
the
record.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
165
the
very
first
few
lines
of
that
page,
which
is
a
part
of
the
order
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
amending
it's
remittitur
and
setting
forth
that
federal
constitutional
questions
had
been
raised,
passed
upon
and
the
claim
that
federal
constitutional
right
denied.
so
that
is
the
posture
of
the
case
as
it
came
to
this
court.
now
we
contend
three
things.
first
an
attack
upon
the
statute
permitting
summary
proceedings
where
the
circumstances
do
not
require
it,
particularly
where
the
proceedings
occur
after
the
expiration
of
the
trial
itself,
so
that
the
trial
judge
felt
no
necessity
for
immediate
action
because
of
the
character
of
the
contempt
charge.
obviously
there
are
situations
in
which
the
contempt
charge
is
such
a
character
that
immediate
action
must
be
taken
as
if
a
person
starts
a
disturbance,
a
physical
disturbance
in
a
courtroom
and
can
be
physically
removed
and
immediately
punished
and
various
other
circumstances
of
that
sort
which
are
not
involved
in
this
case.
now,
that
point
will
be
elaborated
by
mr.
redfield.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes,
he
was
a
lawyer,
but
primarily
at
that
time
engaged
in
real
estate,
i
believe.
he
had
been
a
lawyer
since
1935.
the
second
question
then
is
a
propriety
of
the
matter
coming
up
before
the
same
judge
which
requires
a
review
of
the
relationship
between
the
parties,
the
extent
to
which
hostility
had
arisen
during
the
course
of
the
first,
as
well
as
the
second
trial
between
the
trial
judge
and
the
witness
and
the
extent
to
which
the
specific
remarks
constituted
a
reflection
upon
the
trial
judge
and
whether
or
not
therefore
there
is
a
substantial
basis
for
the
rather
unusual
departure
by
the
court
of
appeals
from
it's
ordinary
practice
of
merely
certifying
questions
and
indicating
this
judgment
about
the
character
of
the
remarks,
and
mr.
redfield
will
also
deal
with
that
subject.
finally,
there
is
the
point
which
i
want
to
stress
for
a
moment
a
little
further
that
in
the
light
of
all
of
these
circumstances
it
was
a
denial
of
due
process
to
refuse
an
adjournment.
here
was
no
situation
of
urgency
of
any
kind
whatever.
the
trial
had
ended
several
weeks
before
the
hearing.
the
judge
himself
had
taken
rather
the
district
attorney's
office
i
believe
at
the
judge's
request
had
taken
some
eight
days
to
prepare
the
charges
which
were
fairly
voluminous.
the
papers
were
served
on
the
eve
of
a
weekend
with
little
time
for
preparation.
the
difficulties
of
obtaining
counsel
in
such
a
situation
are
of
course
well
known.
lawyers
dislike
appearing
against
judges
and
there
was
no
reason
as
obtainable
to
anybody,
why
when
this
request
for
adjournment
was
made
it
could
not
have
been
granted.
nothing
would
have
been
interfered
with
except
perhaps
the
judge's
own
feelings,
which
merely
underlined
the
impropriety
of
that
particular
judge,
sitting
there
and
passing
on
the
matter.
it
isn't
as
though
this
were
a
situation
where
there
had
been
long
delay.
it
isn't
even
a
situation
where
there
were
any
witnesses
that
had
to
be
called
who
would
not
be
available.
there
was
nothing,
just
absolutely
nothing
in
the
situation
as
it
then
existed
that
would
justify
a
reasonable
request
for
an
adjournment.
there
wasn't
even
an
opportunity
under
the
particular
circumstances
here
existing
for
appellant
to
have
filed
a
written
answer
to
this
rather
long
petition
which
was
served
on
him
and
no
written
--
and
so
why
--
isn't
the
record
inconsequence?
there
was
no
opportunity,
really
--
real
opportunity
for
him
to
consult
with
counsel.
he
wanted
an
opportunity
to
explore
the
situation
which
existed
and
possibility
of
medical
evidence
to
support
his
contention
with
regard
to
his
disturbed
state
of
mind
on
that
occasion.
in
any
event
one
can
only,
it
seems
to
me
characterize,
the
judge's
refusal
to
grant
this
request
for
adjournment
as
a
fully
arbitrary
judicial
act,
and
therefore,
a
clear
denial
of
due
process
because
basic,
aside
from
all
other
considerations
which
have
developed
in
the
law
of
due
process,
basic
is
the
right
of
a
person
to
have
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
defend
himself
and
we
submit
that
no
such
opportunity
was
granted
here
and
that
--
therefore
regardless
of
all
other
considerations,
this
conviction
cannot
be
supported.
mr.
redfield's
will
deal
–
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
he
had
been
warned,
but
after
all
the
things
that
are
said
in
the
heat
of
trial
are
not
always
carried
out
and
ungar
may
very
well
have
felt,
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
last
few
days
of
the
–
his
appearance
as
a
witness
passed
without
any
incident,
any
difficulty
of
any
kind
that
the
judge
would
let
the
matter
rest.
he
apparently
felt
that
way.
he
had
sensed
so
in
the
papers,
which
were
here
in
the
record.
now
whether
he
was
justified
in
that
whether
a
less,
a
person
of
perhaps
less
optimistic
frame
of
mind
might
not
have
done
something
immediately,
i
submit
is
not
the
issue
here
because
even
if
mr.
ungar
had
known
that
he
was
going
to
be
charged,
he
couldn't
know
until
the
papers
were
served
on
him
exactly
with
what
he
was
going
to
be
charged
because
there
had
been
two
or
three
earlier
instances
in
which
the
judge
had
objected
to
mr.
ungar's
manner
of
testifying
and
issued
some
sort
of
veiled
warning
even
then.
and
in
any
case
until
he
got
the
papers
he
was
not
really
in
a
position,
i
would
suppose,
to
consult
a
lawyer
to
find
out
how
you
should
handle
it.
he
by
that
time
i
suspect
must
have
realized
that
like
many
lawyers
he
made
a
bad
witness,
those
lawyers
do
the
tradition
is
and
this
has
been
my
own
personal
experience
and
he
felt
when
he
saw
these
papers
that
he
needed
help.
but
even
if
he
had
--
should
have
--
sought
help
sooner,
i
still
say
that
the
circumstances
were
such
as
not
to
justify
the
denial
of
an
adjournment.
this
was
again
repeated,
it
wasn't
the
situation
where
a
host
of
people
had
been
called
jurors,
and
witnesses
and
everybody
prepared
to
go
into
a
long
trial,
so
that
an
adjournment
would
inconvenience
people.
nobody
would
have
been
inconvenienced
by
this
adjournment
not
even
the
trial
judge
himself
really
if
he
was
going
ahead
with
his
other
business
and
set
this
down
for
a
week
later
and
gone
ahead
under
the
proper
procedures.
so
i
submit
that
under
all
of
these
circumstances
this
conviction
does
not
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that's
right.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that's
true.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
[attempt
to
laughter]
you
are
familiar,
one
is
familiar
with
the
testimony
that
one
has
given,
but
i
have
been
a
witness
and
i
have
been
a
speaker
and
one
is
sometimes
amazed
at
what
one
sees
on
the
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
--
(inaudible)
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
of
course
he
was
generally
familiar,
but
even
if
he
had
been
more
specifically
familiarized
he
will
say
that's
no
justification
for
denying
a
reasonable
request
for
an
adjournment
when
no
one
could
suffer
any
harm
by
that
request.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well
one
never
knows
what
good
would
be
accomplished
from
the
advice
of
a
lawyer
to
a
client,
that's
one
of
the
things
that
this
court
has
in
recent
years
come
to
realize
i
believe
more
and
more.
after
all
the
whole
philosophy
of
the
gideon's
case
is
just
that.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
one
doesn't
know
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well
it's
not
a
gideon
case,
but
it's
nevertheless
a
case
in
which
a
lawyer
could
have
been
of
help
in
formulating,
first
a
specific
answer
and
second
if
necessary
producing
medical
testimony,
third
in
advising
the
defendant
himself,
what
attitude
he
should
take.
i
think
that
this
is
a
contempt
charge
particularly
where
a
lawyer
is
involved
is
a
serious
enough
matter
to
require
the
advice
of
counsel.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no
he
didn't
really
have
the
advice
of
counsel
because
he
retained
counsel
over
the
telephone
under
circumstances
where
discussion
was
difficult
and
counsel
was
already
engaged
in
another
case
and
his
mind
presumably
was
more
involved
with
that
case,
which
he
was
in
the
process
of
trying,
it
was
a
difficult
situation
and
i
don't
think
that
it
can
fairly
be
said
that
he
had
the
advice
of
counsel.
he
certainly
didn't
feel
that
he
had
and
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
counsel
hadn't
been
engaged
in
another
trail?
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes
i
think
counsel
would
then
have
asked
for
a
shorter
adjournment
a
day
or
two
so
that
he
could
prepare
an
answer.
after
all
this
was
a
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well
that
was
unfortunate
but
one
can't
always
get
the
lawyer
that
one
wants
and
it
is
true
that
–
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yeah,
well
sure
but
it
is
--
this
is
of
course
a
certain
curious
combination
of
circumstances.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes
i
should
say
--
i
say
that
when
a
person
involved
in
a
serious
charge
asks
for
a
reasonable
adjournment
which
would
inconvenience
nobody
really,
he
is
entitled
to
it.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
it
was
served
on
thursday
afternoon
at
about
4:30
in
the
afternoon
and
it
was
returnable
tuesday.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
and
it
so
happened
that
monday
was
practically
a
day
that
didn't
count.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
no
that
you
might
be,
you
didn't
know
that
you
were.
all
that
the
judge
said
was,
he
issued
one
or
two
warnings,
but
judges
do
that
frequently
and
do
nothing
about
it.
at
the
end
of
the
trial
he
had
said
the
appellant
that
he
should
be
around,
should
be
available.
so
that
appellant
undoubtedly
had
some
reason
to
suspect
that
he
might
be
charged,
but
he
couldn't
know
exactly
what
he
was
going
to
be
charged
with
whether
he
was
going
to
be
confined
to
one
thing
or
more
things
and
again
i
say
that
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
make
the
difference.
the
question
is
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
review
questions
of
discretion
of
course.
the
court
of
appeals
reviewed
the
contention
whether
there
was
a
denial
of
due
process,
no
doubt
about
that.
both
of
the
courts
reviewed
it,
but
we
again
with
all
respect
to
those
courts,
this
court
has
frequently
disregarded
the
action
of
state
courts
no
matter
how
unanimous
and
i
don't
think
that
is
the
issue
here.
i
think
the
issue
is
whether
in
a
serious
matter,
a
person
who
comes
into
court
and
says
i'd
like
a
short
adjournment
so
that
i
can
really
have
the
benefit
of
counsel
shouldn't
get
it.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
and
if
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no
there
is
nothing
automatic
mr.
justice.
i
don't
believe
that
light
this
anything
automatic
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
where
there
is
no
reason
otherwise
there
are
many
situations
in
which
the
request
for
an
adjournment
is
properly
denied
either
because
there
had
been
earlier
adjournments
or
because
it
is
known
that
jurors
and
witness
are
going
to
be
available
and
there
will
be
inconvenienced,
there
are
--
automatic
i
would
ever
say,
but
where
there
is
no
reason
for
objecting,
where
there
is
no
reason
for
denial
other
than
i
don't
like
to
use
the
word
whim
when
referred
to
--
referring
to
a
judge,
but
i
suspect
that
one
can
almost
say
that.
the
judge
insisted
that
he
was
going
to
go
on.
he
was
all
raring
to
go.
he
wanted
that
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that's
right,
that's
right,
that's
all
i
am
saying.
that's
all
i
am
saying.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
believe
on
the
saturday
morning
when
he
spoke
to
it,
yes.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes,
i
believe
that
it's
very
convenient
to
speak
of
these
things
as
exercises
of
discretion,
but
i
submit
that
where
there
are
no
factors
which
bring
discretion
into
play,
in
other
words
where
there
are
no
factors
which
have
one
thing
on
one
side
of
the
balance
and
something
else
on
the
other,
then
it's
not
an
exercise
of
discretion,
but
an
arbitrary
act.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
because
he
had
--
i
should
say
the
reasonable
expectation
which
any
new
york
practitioner
has
that
when
he
goes
into
court
and
says
his
lawyer
is
engaged,
that
the
matter
is
held
for
the
lawyer's
engagement,
and
there
is
a
rule
to
that
effect
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
courts
which
is
quoted
in
the
brief.
if
this
had
been
a
trial,
if
this
had
been
a
trial
the
engagement
would
have
been
respected.
so
that
i
say
here
there
was
no
question
of
exercise
of
discretion
in
the
ordinary
sense
because
there
were
no
factors
weighing
with
the
judge's
refusal.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well
i
submit
that
he
was
denied
the
opportunity
of
effective
representation
by
counsel.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that's
right
and
he
wanted
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no
question
about
the
fact
that
he
said
it,
the
question
is
a
development
of
the
circumstances
under
which
he
said
it;
his
motivation,
his
intentions
all
of
which
could
have
been
brought
to
the
trial
judge's
attention
more
effectively
by
a
lawyer
than
by
the
person
involved.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
it
happened
in
open
court
but
nevertheless
things
that
happened
in
open
court
are
not
necessarily
free
from
inquiry.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
what
happened
on
page
111
was
a
last
ditch
plea
by
the
person
involved,
but
it's
never
as
effective
as
a
proper
presentation
by
counsel.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
not
when
there
has
already
been
hostility
between
the
two
individuals
involved.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
agree
--
doesn't
agree
with
what
i
said
of
course,
but
it
isn't
the
first
time
that
i've
disagreed
with
the
court
of
appeals
and
on
one
or
two
occasions
at
least
this
court
has
agreed
with
me,
not
always,
but
often
enough
to
make
me
venturesome
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that's
right,
oh
yeah.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
ten
days
and
$250
in
fine,
which
by
the
way
he
has
served
because
he
was
denied
a
stay
and
the
fine
was
paid
under
protest,
but
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that's
right.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that's
right.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well
i
assume
that
if
he
had
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes
and
that
was
--
we
refer
to
that
of
course
in
our
briefs
here.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that
should
certainly
have
been
one
of
the
things
which
a
lawyer
was
going
to
--
would
have
done
though,
a
competent
lawyer
should
have
done.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
i
can't
say
that
in
so
many
words,
mr.
justice
goldberg
because
i
don't
know
that
it
was
formulated
precisely
like
that
to
the
judge,
but
it
was
certainly
inherent
in
the
situation
because
the
witness
had
made
it
perfectly
plain
that
he
was
emotionally
disturbed.
the
lawyer
had
said
so,
the
appellant
himself
said
so.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
oh
no.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
but
the
claim
is
that
after
having
been
on
the
stand
for
several
days
and
caught
in
this
crossfire
of
opposition
both
by
the
prosecutor
and
the
defense
attorney,
he
had
reached
a
point
where
he
felt
he
couldn't
--
that
particular
morning
instead
of
feeling
of
frustration,
he
was
trying
to
answer
questions,
was
interrupted
because
he
was
going
further
than
the
question
asked.
he
was
asked
for
instance
during
the
conversation
did
you
tell
mr.
jack
such
and
such
thing
and
what
did
mr.
jack
say
and
he
started
to
say
well
there
was
much
more
to
it
than
that.
it
wasn't
--
his
reply
wasn't
just
to
this
particular
thing
and
he
was
cut
off
and
that
happened
several
times
and
then
he
got
to
the
point
where
he
said
quietly
and
respectfully
i
am
sorry
i'd
like
to
step
down,
i'm
so
upset
i
can't
go
any
further,
i
can't
even
hear
the
questions.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well
i
mean.
mr.
justice
clark
i'm
talking
now
before
this
outburst,
on
that
--
the
moment
preceding
the
outburst
without
any
outburst
there
had
been
twice
or
three
times
repeated
requests
that
he
be
permitted
to
step
down
to
compose
himself.
that
is
the
atmosphere
in
which
this
outburst
occurred.
now,
it
is
true
in
the
outburst
he
attacked
the
judge
as
well
as
the
counsel
on
the
other
side
and
he
had
i
think
once
or
twice
indicated
that
he
felt
the
judge
was
cutting
off
his
answers
and
that
the
judge
was
perhaps
unduly
sympathetic
to
the
point
of
view
of
the
prosecutor
here.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
once
that
occurred
yes,
once
that
occurred.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
the
specific
request
for
that
apparently
was
act
of
these
convictions,
that's
why
in
answer
to
the
specific
request
for
it
was
at
the
--
but
implied,
i
submit.
on
page
111,
i
will
submit
medical
proof
to-date
to
show
this
was
an
involuntary
statement
and
so
forth
and
was
denied
by
the
court,
but
i'm
suggesting
that
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
would
say
that
in
the
total
picture,
yes,
but
of
course
specifically
that
is
not
within
the
terms
of
the
court
of
appeals'
remittitur.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
it's
part
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes
that's
right.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
it's
not
altogether,
whether
a
specific
isolated
thing
in
this
case
is
a
denial
of
due
process,
but
whether
taking
the
thing
as
a
picture,
the
result
isn't
that
this
appellant
was
denied
the
basic
essentials
of
a
fair
hearing,
namely
the
real
opportunity
to
defend
himself.
now
with
the
question
of
the
statute
right
of
this
judge
to
sit
in
this
case,
mr.
redfield
will
deal.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no
rebuttal.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no
your
honor.
