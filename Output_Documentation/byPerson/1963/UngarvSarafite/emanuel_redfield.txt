mr.
emanuel
redfield
may
it
please
the
court.
if
this
court
were
to
rest
this
decision
in
this
case
solely
on
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
denial
of
due
process
because
of
the
circumstances
in
connection
with
the
contempt
proceeding
itself
with
regard
to
the
intent
of
this
appellant
or
with
regard
to
the
question
of
a
proper
adjournment,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
adequate
attention
given
to
this
case.
i
think
this
case
digs
deeper
and
in
order
to
get
to
the
roots
of
some
of
the
problems
that
lie
in
questions
of
contempt,
i
brought
this
case
here
on
appeal
and
i
think
this
case
is
a
fitting
companion
to
the
case
of
united
states
against
de
ross
upon
that
which
you
have
under
consideration
and
i
think
it
helped
develop
the
entire
picture
of
contempt.
now,
in
the
panico
case
which
you
decided
a
few
months
ago,
you
held
almost
verbatim
what
the
ungar
here
wants
and
what
the
result
would
be,
would
to
send
this
case
back
for
a
new
trial
if
you
did
reverse
and
you
would
still
leave
the
question
open
as
to
whether
or
not
due
process
is
accorded
to
an
accused
in
the
contempt
proceeding.
if
you
permit
the
accusing
judge
to
sit
in
the
case
–
mr.
emanuel
redfield
not
totally
different
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
right.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i'm
translating
it
into
due
process
in
this
state
case.
so
we
come
to
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
man
was
accorded
due
process
of
law
under
the
statute
of
new
york
as
it
exists
and
as
construed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
statute
permits
summary
proceedings
to
be
had
before
the
same
judge
if
the
judge
observes
the
accused
and
was
present
during
the
contempt
that
resulted.
the
court
of
appeals
so
construed
it
and
the
court
of
appeals
by
some
queerness
had
admonished
that
in
the
event
of
a
future
case
of
a
similar
nature
that
the
trial
should
take
place
before
another
judge,
but
it
didn't
do
him
any
good.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
as
tradition
goes,
it
has
been
held
that
that
could
be
done,
but
you
still
might
have
the
same
question
raised
by
the
defendant
at
that
time,
was
he
of
emotional
state
at
the
time
so
that
an
intent
could
be
spelled
out,
but
that
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
it
may
have
in
his
discretion
and
in
that
respect
i
cannot
ignore,
but
the
occasion
however
of
the
contempt
having
evaporated
after
the
trial
had
ended
days
later,
i
don't
see
what
necessity
there
was
for
any
summary
proceeding.
the
justification
that
has
been
sought
to
eliminate
these
summary
proceedings
has
been
one
of
necessity
that
the
court
has
to
do
something
about
it
at
the
time
so
that
the
trial
could
proceed,
but
if
the
trial
is
over
what
necessity
is
there?
mr.
emanuel
redfield
it's
not
(inaudible)
it's
a
different
state
of
affairs.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
fine.
so
assuming
your
honor,
if
this
were
not
a
contempt
proceeding,
assuming
you
had
charged
him
with
disorderly
conduct
in
a
regular
penal
prosecution,
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
all
he
is
asking
for
here
including
a
judge
other
than
the
judge
who
made
the
charges
against
him.
he
had
that
alternative.
we
have
duplications
of
law
in
this
respect
in
new
york
in
three
ways.
we
have
it
in
this
type
of
proceeding
that's
before
you.
we
have
it
in
what
they
call
a
criminal
contempt
of
prosecution
through
a
grand
jury
indictment
and
so
on
you
know
which
i
had
here
some
years
ago
on
the
regan
case
if
you
recall
and
we
also
have
disorderly
conduct
statute.
now,
if
this
man
had
been
tried
for
you
know
minor
thing
like
parking
ticket,
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
an
unbiased
judge
and
entitled
to
an
adjournment
and
entitled
to
right
of
counsel.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that's
is
a
mystery
to
me
your
honor,
if
there
is
anything
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
yes,
but
i
would
go
still
further.
i
wouldn't
limit
my
attack
to
such
situations.
i
would
say
that
even
if
there
haven't
been
an
attack
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
is
a
condensation
of
lets
say
rule
42
of
the
federal
practice,
but
i
would
go
still
further.
i
would
say
that
even
if
there
hasn't
been
an
attack,
there
should
be
due
process
and
that
there
should
be
an
impartial
judge
sitting
in
it
if
there
is
no
necessity
or
an
emergency
for
an
immediate
trial.
that's
the
gist
of
the
whole
argument
and
i
think
your
honor
made
that
specifically
clear
to
me
in
the
green
case.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
can't
understand
that
that
was
on
the
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i'd
assume
that
this
is
on
the
amendment
of
the
remittitur.
i
--
it's
a
mystery
to
me
because
if
there
ever
was
an
attack
on
the
judge
if
it
was
here
--
any
person
says
the
judge
is
suppressing
evidence,
god
i
don't
know
what
--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
i
know
they
said
that
but
i
disagree
with
that.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
this
--
about
being
a
personal
atttack
on
him,
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
follow
it
i
am
sorry.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well
he,
the
court
held--
mr.
emanuel
redfield
well
–
he
said
many
things,
but
the
important
thing
he
said
was
that
he
was
being
badgered.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
and
that
he
was
being
coerced.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
and
that
he
--
and
that
he
--
the
court
was
suppressing
the
evidence.
mr.
emanuel
redfield
that
seem
so
to
me
that
that's
what
they
held,
but
i
don't
see
there
was
any
foundation
for
that,
but
as
i
said
justice
black,
i
would
go
still
further
in
my
challenge
that
my
challenge
is
a
deeper
one
and
that
is
that
if
the
trial
at
which
the
contempt
took
place
seized
and
there
was
now
a
contempt
proceeding
later
on,
i
think
such
a
contempt
proceeding
should
be
before
an
impartial
judge
because
there
should
be
an
appearance
of
impartiality.
and
from
this
record
you
cannot,
anybody
can
conclude
that
this
judge
was
impartial
in
his,
in
his
haste,
in
his
lack
of
temper
and
also
fining
him
--
sentencing
him
for
10
days
in
jail
without
giving
him
a
chance
to
obtain
a
lawyer.
i
think
that
covers
my
argument
in
a
nutshell.
