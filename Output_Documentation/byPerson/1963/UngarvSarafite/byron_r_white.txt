justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
counsel
hadn't
been
engaged
in
another
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
suggest
the
schedule
is
too
rapid
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
is
this
really,
it's
a
really
a
(inaudible)
that
he
asked
this
particular
lawyer?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
always
true.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
really
have
to
argue
that
no
matter
who,
who
your
client
had
called,
whatever
is
available
in
that
that
the
time
was
too
short?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
much
notice
did
you
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
it
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
although
he
knew,
although
he
knew
before
that
he
is
going
to
be
tried
for
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
had
written
the
note
to
the
judge,
the
judge
was,
the
same
thing
happened
expect
that
while
he
was
testifying,
he
wrote
this
note,
the
judge
had
said,
you
are
coercing
me,
you
are
suppressing
evidence,
just
handed
it
up
to
the
judge.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
i
take
it
that
you
would
say
the
same
result
could
follow.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
that
would
certainly
offend
the
dignity
of
the
judge.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
you
are
suggesting
that
in
front
of
a
judge
really
a
(inaudible)
effect
of
the
evidence
on
the
jury
or
might
undermine
it
or
the
--
or
might
really
substantially
affect
the
outcome
of
the
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
why
wouldn't
the
note,
why
wouldn't
the
written
note
be--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
that's
got
to
do
with
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
the
procedures
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
