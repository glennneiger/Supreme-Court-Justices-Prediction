mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
acquisition
of
rome
cable
company
by
alcoa
took
place
in
1959
and
was
originally
attacked
by
the
government
in
10
lines
of
commerce.
the
district
court
held
that
in
all
10
lines
of
commerce,
the
government
had
neither
--
either
or
not
established
the
lines
of
commerce
or
had
failed
to
show
a
probable
substantial
lessening
of
competition.
now,
among
the
lines
of
commerce
that
the
government
had
in
the
district
court
and
which
they
are
not
urging
in
this
court,
other
vertical
aspects
of
this
case,
they
alleged
in
the
district
court
that
by
virtue
of
this
acquisition,
competing
aluminum
suppliers
would
be
foreclosed
from
supplying
rome
as
a
market
for
aluminum
--
aluminum
ingot.
it
was
also
alleged
that
there
would
be
a
diminution
of
competition
and
a
foreclosure
in
the
furnishing
of
rod,
which
is
the
basic
material
on
which
aluminum
wire
and
cable
--
aluminum
rod
to
the
basis
--
basic
material
from
which
aluminum
wire
and
cable
is
drawn.
in
these
vertical
lines
of
commerce,
the
district
court
held
against
the
government
and
the
government
has
not
appealed,
so
that
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
now
about
alcoa's
integration.
this
case
has
now
become
a
case
involving
wire
and
cable.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
the
foreclosure
of
manufacturers
as
there
was
in
the
competing
manufacturers,
as
there
was
in
the
brown
shoe
case.
this
case
is
horizontal
and
horizontal
only
now.
now,
on
appeal,
the
government
has
relied
on
two
lines
of
commerce.
one,
insulated
aluminum
wire
and
cable,
which
the
district
court
found
not
to
be
a
line
of
commerce
and
two,
aluminum
insulated
wire
and
cable
which
the
district
court
also
found
not
to
be
a
line
of
commerce.
insulated
aluminum
wire
and
cable
is
a
combination
of
bare
aluminum
wire
and
cable,
a
line
of
commerce
which
we
admitted
in
the
district
court
because
there,
there
was
no
competition
with
copper.
their
specialized
know-how
was
required.
their
aluminum
had
virtually
replaced
copper
in
the
transmission
of
electrical
energy
and
there,
there
was
a
recognized
industry
of
producers
of
aluminum
bare
wire
and
cable.
the
court
found
that
in
that
line
of
commerce,
even
though
we
admitted
it
that
there
was
no
adverse
effect
because
in
that
line
of
commerce,
alcoa
with
32.5%
of
the
market,
acquired
rome
with
three
tenths
of
a
percent
of
the
market.
and
the
court
held
that
this,
in
the
light
of
all
other
economic
factors
which
i
will
come
to
later,
was
too
insubstantial
as
to
constitute
a
substantial
lessening
of
competition.
now,
the
government's
second
line
of
commerce
here,
the
insulated
or
the
aluminum
wire
and
cable
line
of
commerce
is
nothing
more,
despite
what
the
solicitor
general
has
said,
a
numerical
trick
to
add
alcoa's
high
figures,
admittedly
high
figures,
in
their
aluminum
to
their
relatively
low
figures
in
insulated
aluminum
to
come
up
with
a
line
of
commerce
that
would
might
bring
this
case
within
the
test
of
philadelphia
national
bank
because
you
get
to
close
to
30%.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
well,
that's
--
i
think
that's
quite
right,
your
honor,
but
i
think
we
have
--
we
have
an
additional
problem
because
assuming
that
--
well,
if
he
doesn't
make
out
on
--
on
insulated
because
they
have
an
appeal
and
there
is
no
case
and
that
--
there's
--
there's
no
charge
of
substantial
lessening
competition
and
i
think
it
is
true
that
--
that
if
he
doesn't
make
out
on
an
insulator,
he
cannot
add
the
two
together.
and
he
said
that
this
--
this
was
the
--
this
was
the
--
the
reason
that
the
district
court
didn't
lump
them
together
because
he
said
the
district
court
said,
"you
can't
lump
insulated
and
copper
wire
and
cable
with
bare
aluminum
wire
and
cable."
but
the
court
did
not
base
it's
conclusion
on
a
statement
of
that
kind.
the
court
made
a
finding
of
fact
which
said
that
aluminum
conductor
wire
and
cable
excludes
insulated
copper
products
and
therefore,
it
does
not
include
all
wire
and
cable
products
for
which
there
is
reasonable
interchangeability
of
use
or
cross-elasticity
of
demand.
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
"in
addition,
the
evidence
fails
to
establish
that
the
combination
of
bare
and
insulated
aluminum
wire
and
cable
considered
as
a
whole
is
generally
recognized
in
the
industry
as
a
separate
mark
--
economic
entity
or
submarket."
now,
the
court's
finding
was
based
on
the
fact
that
these
two
products,
bare
aluminum
wire
and
cable
and
insulated
aluminum
wire
and
cable.
in
addition
to
constituting
separate
markets
are
so
--
so
completely
different
from
one
another
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
include
within
the
same
line
of
commerce.
and
i
would
like
at
this
time,
if
--
if
i
may,
just
to
show
the
court
what
we're
talking
about
here
in
some
of
these
things.
this
is
bare
aluminum,
acsr.
this
is
used
in
the
transmission
of
electrical
energy
from
the
generating
station
to
the
distribution
station.
there
is
no
copper
substitute
for
this.
insulated
copper
is
not
used
at
all
in
the
transmission
of
electrical
energy
--
i
mean
an
insulated
aluminum
is
not
used
at
all
in
the
transmission
of
electrical
energy.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
yes,
your
honor.
now,
there
is
a
smaller
type
of
bare
aluminum
conductor.
this
is
what
they
call
the
transmission
of
the
distribution
size
of
aluminum
conductor.
this
is
the
product
that
rome
make
--
made.
rome
did
not
make
this
large
size
at
all.
90%
of
alcoa's
business
in
aluminum
wire
and
cable
was
in
that
size.
rome's
percentage
of
the
market
in
this
size
of
cable
was
three
tenths
of
1%.
there
is
no
--
there's
no
substitution
between
this
and
insulated
aluminum
because
nobody
would
use
insulated
aluminum
were
it
could
use
bare.
thus
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
this
is
used
for
the
distribution
from
the
--
when
the
--
when
the
--
the
energy
is
transmitted
first
from
the
generator
through
these
heavy
lines
to
so-called
distribution
stations
where
the
amount
of
voltages
stepped
down
and
it
is
then
distributed
to
power
stations.
now,
where
bare
can
be
used
in
this
line?
insulated
is
never
used
because
of
a
cost
difference.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
much
more.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
alcoa
made
this,
yes.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
10%.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
10
--
10%
of
their
bare.
now,
here
are
the
insulated
products
that
we're
talking
about.
this
is
insulated
aluminum
line
wire.
this
also
is
used
in
the
distribution
of
electrical
energy
where
insulation
is
required.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
it's
exactly
this
--
no,
it
--
well,
it
can
be
the
same
as
the
bare
except
for
the
insulation.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
yes,
your
honor.
we
showed
you
a
--
what
they
call
a
four
awg
size.
this
i
--
i've
--
this
is
a
--
a
one
awg,
american
wire
gauge
size.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
primarily,
protection
from
the
weather,
safety
factors
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
it
all
depends
what
you
use
it
for,
your
honor,
if
i
may
come
to
that
just
a
little
bit
later.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
this
is
the
copper
counterpart
of
the
insulated
line
--
aluminum
line
wire
that
i
have
just
shown
you.
this
is
used
for
exactly
the
same
purpose
as
the
aluminum
is
used.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
there
--
there
is
a
--
a
fair
difference
in
price,
your
honor.
i
--
i
would
imagine
that
one
is
35%
to
40%.
the
copper
is
35%
to
40%
more
expensive.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
none
whatsoever,
your
honor.
this
piece
of
aluminum,
which
is
bigger
than
the
copper
because
aluminum
could
carry
the
same
amount
of
electricity,
must
be
two
sizes
larger
than
copper
because
aluminum
has
only
62%
conductivity
and
copper
has
100%
conductivity.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
as
you
purchase
it.
as
you
purchase
the
piece
of
wire.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
but
there
are
other
factors
that
go
into
the
determination
as
to
whether
he
buy
it
or
not.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
the
--
the
copper
is
--
is
generally
lighter
than
the
aluminum
because
i
think,
one
pound
of
copper
is
the
equivalent
--
one
--
three
--
three
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
--
pounds
of
copper
to
--
to
one
pound
of
aluminum.
aluminum
is
lighter,
yes.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
not
in
these
products,
your
honor.
now,
this
is
aluminum
multiplex
cable.
this
is
also
used
in
the
transmission
of
other
distribution
of
electrical
energy
and
it
is
also
used
to
transmit
the
power
from
the
line
to
the
house.
this
is
the
copper
counterpart.
they
perform
exactly
the
same
function.
they
have
equal
conductivity.
and
again,
your
honor,
the
copper
is
more
expensive
than
the
aluminum.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
well,
it
doesn't
have
to
be,
your
honor,
and
they
save
money
by
not
doing
it.
it's
the
--
the
problem
is
to
keep
the
wires
from
coming
into
contact
with
one
another
and
not
in
contact
with
--
with
the
--
the
public
as
it
were.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
and
--
and
as
long
as
you
insulate
two
away,
all
--
all
are
protected
from
each
other.
now,
these
wire
and
cable
products
that
i
had
just
shown
you,
the
insulated
ones,
the
aluminum
was
made
by
alcoa
before
the
acquisition.
the
copper
and
aluminum
were
made
by
rome
prior
to
the
acquisition.
and
it's
only
in
the
small
bare
wire
or
cable
that
i
showed
you
and
the
two
insulated
products
that
i
showed
you
that
there
was
any
overlap
in
competition
between
the
two.
and
this
is
the
area
where
the
11.6%
and
the
4.7%
that
mr.
cox
talked
about
exist.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
alcoa
never
manufacture
the
copper.
the
rome
continues
to
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
rome
continues
to
manufacture.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
oh,
yes,
they
made
no
change
whatsoever.
now,
in
addition
to
these
products
that
i
have
shown
you,
rome
made
products
such
as
these.
these
are
power
cables
and
control
table
--
cables
with
many
conductors
insulated
within
insulated
conductors.
they
are
the
most
sophisticated
types
of
conductors
that
are
possible
to
make.
and
it
was
this
skill
and
ability
that
alcoa
was
looking
for
when
it
acquired
rome.
the
--
the
district
court
made
an
explicit
finding
on
this
subject
and
i
think
it's
--
it's
where
the
--
i'm
reading
to
you
our
finding
number
7,
where
the
court
said
alcoa's
purpose
in
acquiring
rome
was
to
acquire
the
ability
to
manufacture
the
more
complicated
insulated
wire
and
cable
products
and
to
diversify
its
operations.
rome's
manufacture
of
aluminum
products
did
not
induce
said
acquisition.
what
alcoa
was
interested
in
in
acquiring
rome
was
the
ability
to
acquire
these
insulating
skills
that
rome
had
that
alcoa
did
not
have.
and
in
order
to
have
a
full
line
of
products,
not
in
aluminum,
but
a
full
line
of
products,
copper,
that
they
could
offer
their
customers.
now,
it
is
true
that
as
--
as
mr.
cox
said
that
alcoa
was
virtually
the
sole
supplier
of
acsr
and
bare
aluminum
prior
to
world
war
ii.
during
this
period,
there
was
practically
no
demand
for
insulated
aluminum
wire
and
cable
products
because
it
was
all
being
furnished
in
copper.
alcoa
gave
some
thought
to
it
but
it
went
to
existing
insulators
and
suggested
to
these
insulators
that
they
might
experiment
with
aluminum
as
a
conductor
instead
of
copper.
with
the
advent
of
the
korean
war,
however,
and
copper
became
short,
the
demand
for
aluminum
increased.
and
when
this
demand
increased,
those
who
were
previously
making
copper
insulated
products
very
quickly
turned
to
insulating
aluminum.
they
made
it
on
the
same
machinery,
they
made
it
with
the
same
personnel,
they
sold
it
to
the
same
customers
to
whom
they
were
selling
it
before
and
they
sold
it
with
the
same
sales
personnel
that
they
were
selling.
as
this
developed,
alcoa
was
asked
by
its
customers
if
they
wouldn't
supply
insulated
aluminum
wire
and
cable.
and
alcoa
lacked
the
know-how
to
do
this,
even
to
construct
these
simple
insulated
products
that
they
subsequently
made.
alcoa
had
dealt
with
rome
and
alcoa
turned
to
rome
and
said,
"we
would
like
to
go
into
the
insulating
business,
can
you
give
us
the
know-how
and
show
us
how
to
do
it?"
and
rome
said,
"well,
we
got
a
better
idea,
why
don't
you
let
us
insulate
for
you?"
so
a
tolling
arrangement
was
worked
out
whereby
alcoa
supplied
the
wire
and
rome
supplied
the
insulation.
in
the
meantime,
while
all
of
this
was
going
on,
alcoa's
position
in
aluminum
wire
and
cable
bare
declined
precipitously.
in
1954,
alcoa's
position
in
acsr
was
48.4%.
in
1956,
it
was
30%.
now,
as
a
result
of
this,
alcoa
felt
the
need
to
diversify
its
product
and
to
diversify
into
copper,
who
was
already
making
or
selling
aluminum.
so
that
they
turned
to
rome
and
suggested
acquisition
to
rome
and
rome
refused
to
sell.
alcoa
wasn't
interested
in
rome's
bare
aluminum
obviously.
it
didn't
need
rome's
capacity
for
aluminum
insulated
wire
and
cable,
they
already
had
it.
but
what
they
needed
was
the
copper
products
and
the
know-how
and
the
--
and
the
diversification
that
the
proper
--
products
would've
given.
now,
rome
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
well,
i'll
just
going
to
say
no.
i
don't
know
where
rome
stands
in
the
copper
picture
as
a
--
from
a
--
i
mean,
from
a
numerical
standpoint.
but
rome
was
essentially
a
copper
producer.
95
--
90%
to
95%
the
court
found
of
its
production
was
devoted
to
copper
facilities.
it
was
highly
skilled,
as
i
said,
in
the
--
in
these
very
sophisticated
insulating
products.
rome
was
not
an
insulator
--
an
innovator
in
aluminum.
rome
hadn't
done
anything
in
aluminum
except
make
it
when
the
demand
came
for
it
in
world
war
--
in
the
korean
war.
the
government
in
its
brief
suggests
that
rome
was
an
innovator
in
aluminum
products
and
they
point
out
that
rome
invented
the
multiplex
cable.
oh,
they
didn't
invent
the
multiplex
cable
but
they
invented
the
multiplex
cable
in
1948
in
copper.
and
then
when
they
started
making
aluminum,
they
readily
adopted
their
--
their
equipment
and
their
machinery
and
their
personnel
and
do
the
making
of
the
same
product
in
aluminum.
now,
when
rome
turned
alcoa
down,
alcoa
was
faced
with
the
problem
how
to
go
forward
in
this.
they
could've
done
one
of
two
things.
they
could've
gone
on
their
own,
as
the
solicitor
general
accept
--
had
suggested,
or
they
could
look
for
another
company
to
acquire.
well,
they
looked
into
doing
it
alone.
and
in
order
to
get
the
type
of
insulating
material
that
they
wanted,
which
had
no
relation
to
aluminum
conductor
wire
and
cable.
the
type
that
they
could
get
for
rome
would've
cost
them
$35
to
$40
million
and
as
the
district
court
found
would've
taken
them
5
to
10
years
to
acquire
the
know-how
and
if
that
--
and
even
at
the
end
of
10
years,
they
would
be
10
years
behind
their
--
the
--
the
present
insulators.
now,
again,
they
reached
the
decision
that
they
would
try
to
acquire
another
company.
they
went
and
they
looked
at
six
other
companies,
not
one
of
them
had
any
interest
in
aluminum
to
speak
of
at
all.
their
sole
interest
in
--
was
in
the
insulating
capacity
and
they
were
unsuccessful.
they
then
turned
to
rome
again
and
they
succeeded
in
making
the
deal.
and
this
is
what
this
lawsuit
is
about.
now,
the
record
shows
and
the
court
found
that
alcoa
was
not
interested
in
rome's
aluminum
production
at
all
that
it
was
not
seeking
a
captive
market
for
aluminum,
that
it
was
not
in
seeking
to
increase
its
capacity
for
aluminum
and
that
it
was
not
for
the
purpose
of
securing
a
competitive
advantage
over
anyone
in
aluminum.
and
they
were
not
concerned
with
rome's
competition
in
aluminum
because
the
record
shows
that
within
a
two-year
period
prior
to
the
merger,
alcoa
lost
five
hundredths
of
1%
of
aluminum
business
to
rome.
and
the
record
also
shows
that
rome
was
not
a
price
cutter.
furthermore,
this
is
a
case
where
not
a
single
competitor
was
hurt.
the
government
brought
forward
witness
after
witness
from
the
industry
and
those
witnesses
testified
that
the
acquisition
had
not
hurt
them.
some
of
them
testified
that
they
didn't
expect
that
the
acquisition
would
hurt
them
in
the
future.
no
one
testified
that
he
expected
that
the
acquisition
would
hurt
him
in
the
future.
and
we
brought
in
8
of
the
10
common
customers
who
bought
from
both
alcoa
and
rome
and
every
one
of
those
8
testified
that
the
loss
of
rome
did
not
hurt
them
in
their
purchasing
of
this
--
of
these
products.
now,
this
i
think
is
--
is
part
of
the
background
of
this
case
that
--
that
is
--
is
fairly
important
when
you
consider
the
--
the
legal
problems
that
arise
as
the
result
of
it.
now,
the
first
question
and
of
course,
the
--
the
threshold
question
here
is
the
line
of
commerce
question.
now,
what
do
we
have
to
determine
in
line
of
commerce?
we've
got
to
find
the
area
of
effective
competition.
if
the
area
is
defined
too
broadly,
then
the
--
the
law
cannot
work
its
force.
if
the
area
is
defined
too
narrowly,
the
--
the
application
of
the
percentages
in
various
factors
are
unrealistic.
now,
underneath
this
problem,
this
court
in
brown
shoe
worked
out
certain
indicia
for
the
purpose
of
testing
not
only
the
broad
markets
but
the
submarkets.
one
of
these
indicia
was
industry
recognition.
now,
i'm
talking
about
insulated
wire
and
cable
products
now.
aluminum
and
copper
together,
not
aluminum
on
the
one
hand
and
copper
on
the
other
hand.
the
court
found
and
the
evidence
sustained
it
that
the
industry
right
here
is
the
insulating
industry
and
not
insulators
of
copper
on
the
one
hand
and
insulators
of
aluminum
on
the
other
hand,
but
insulators.
this
is
how
the
census
characterizes
and
classifies
this
industry.
it's
the
insulating
industry,
not
the
copper
industry,
copper
insulating
industry
or
the
aluminum
industry.
the
people
in
the
business
themselves
consider
themselves
as
insulators.
they
don't
designate
their
product
as
copper
line
wire
or
aluminum
line
wire.
they
designate
their
property
as
insulated
line
wire,
insulated
multiplex
cable,
whatever
it
is,
with
whatever
the
conductor
happens
to
be.
now,
the
next
test
that
the
court
referred
to
in
brown
shoe
was
unique
production
facilities.
the
record
in
this
case
demonstrates
to
a
fairly
well
that
copper
and
aluminum
insulated
wire
and
cable
are
made
on
the
same
machines
by
the
same
personnel
and
that
the
companies
making
them
can
switch
readily
from
copper
to
aluminum
and
all
they
have
to
do,
if
they're
drawing
aluminum
and
they
want
to
switch
to
copper,
is
to
wipe
out
the
machine,
change
the
lubricant
and
they
make
copper.
with
the
insulating
machinery,
you
don't
even
have
to
do
that.
you
just
go
ahead
and
insulate.
now,
the
next
indicia
in
brown
shoe
was
distinct
sellers.
there
are
no
distinct
sellers
here.
the
same
people,
who
sell
copper
insulated
products,
sell
aluminum
insulated
products.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
practically
all
of
them,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
--
the
people
who
sell
aluminum
insulated
products
also
sell
copper
insulated
products,
it
may
not
be
the
other
way
around.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
alcoa
didn't
prior
to
this
acquisition,
that's
right.
now,
the
customers
are
exactly
the
same.
the
next
test
was
distinct
customers,
the
customers
of
the
utility
companies.
the
utility
companies,
the
buyers
for
the
utility
companies
are
informed
buyers.
you're
not
dealing
with
someone
coming
in
off
the
street.
so
you've
got
the
same
customer,
the
same
supplier,
the
same
machinery
and
in
addition
to
that,
you
have
a
product
that
will
do
exactly
the
same
thing
whether
it
be
aluminum
or
copper
because
they
perform
exactly
the
same
function.
now,
the
government
concedes
all
this.
and
they
say,
"it
doesn't
matter
because
there
is
no
price
sensitivity
between
aluminum
and
copper."
so
that
of
the
seven
brown
shoe
indicia,
you
forget
five
of
them
and
you
rely
solely
on
price
sensitivity.
but
this
overlooks
the
supply
indicia
and
the
supply
substitution
problem
here.
in
order
to
comprise
a
market,
and
i
mean
a
narrow
submarket
for
antitrust
purposes,
it
seems
to
me,
if
you
make
product
(a)
and
there
is
product
(b)
and
product
(b)
competes
effectively
for
the
same
use
and
are
price
sensitive,
you
have
--
both
of
those
products
must
be
in
the
line
of
commerce.
but
in
addition
to
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
line
of
commerce,
you
also
must
include
capacity,
the
ability
to
supply
because
if
you
have
product
(a)
and
somebody
else
who
makes
product
(b)
can
supply
product
(a)
at
the
drop
of
a
hat,
he
must
be
included
in
that
market.
so
that
when
you
have
this
interchangeability
of
equipment,
the
same
buyers,
the
same
sellers
and
a
product
capable
of
doing
the
same
thing
and
the
ability
to
switch
from
the
copper
to
the
aluminum,
this
price
sensitivity
test
gets
lost
or
should
get
lost
when
all
of
the
other
indicia
of
the
submarket
are
met.
now,
when
i
say
isn't
just
our
theory
because
the
record
in
this
case
is
very,
very
graphic
on
this
point.
one
of
the
government's
witness
was
asked
by
me
when
he
first
started
to
make
aluminum
insulated
wire
and
cable.
and
he
said
when
i
got
--
when
i
--
when
the
customer
first
asked
me
to.
another
witness
in
this
test
--
in
this
case
said,
"we
don't
care
what
the
customer
--
what
we
supply,
we
are
supplying
the
customer
wants.
if
he
asks
us
for
aluminum,
we'll
give
it
to
him
in
aluminum,
if
he
wants
it
in
copper,
we'll
give
it
to
him
in
copper,
if
he
wants
it
in
bronze,
we'll
give
it
to
him
in
bronze.
we
are
insulators
and
we
will
supply
the
customer
whatever
he
wants."
but
--
now,
this
also,
i
think,
is
buttressed
by
the
fact
that
in
the
korean
war
situation,
when
--
when
copper
became
short,
the
number
of
producers
of
aluminum
wire
and
cable
went
from
4
to
29
practically
overnight.
you
don't
have
to
go
out
and
--
and
--
there
wasn't
anything
that
inhibited
them
from
shifting
from
copper
to
aluminum.
now
--
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
supply
oriented
indicia
is,
if
i
--
if
i
may
use
that
term,
definitely
compels
that
the
--
in
--
that
the
line
of
commerce
be
the
insulated
line
of
commerce
and
that
all
people
capable
of
insulating
be
within
that
line
of
commerce.
now,
this
is
happening
today.
the
record
in
this
case
showed
that
in
1959,
the
general
electric
company
went
from
practically
nothing
in
1958
to
1.5%
of
this
insulated
aluminum
market
in
1959.
and
that
the
circle
company,
a
subsidiary
of
--
of
cerro
went
from
0%
to
1%
in
1959.
and
the
capacity
for
copper,
according
to
the
record,
is
20
times
that
the
capacity
for
aluminum
and
to
leave
that
out
of
this
market
and
judge
this
case
solely
on
shares
of
so-called
insulated
aluminum
conductor
market,
in
my
judgment,
ignores
competitive
realities.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
i
beg
you
pardon,
sir?
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
no,
no,
no,
capacity
to
manufacture.
for
example,
rome
cable
or
general
cable
testified
that
95%
of
their
capacity
was
devoted
to
copper
like
it
really
turn
that
on
the
aluminum.
there
--
there
are
--
there
are
200
other
insulators
of
copper
wire
and
cable
in
this
country,
the
court
found.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
the
court
found
this,
your
honor,
that
practically
all
insulators
of
copper
wire
and
cable
--
cable
can
manufacture
the
simple
insulated
aluminum
wire
and
cable
conductors
that
we're
talking
about.
now,
we're
not
arguing
that
the
congress
is
true,
we're
arguing
that
congress
is
exactly
contrary
that
we,
as
alcoa,
who
could
manufacture
the
more
simple
insulated
products
out
of
aluminum,
we
could
not
turn
our
capacity
into
this
high
--
these
highly
sophisticated
copper
products
but
those
who
make
this
highly
sophisticated
proper
--
copper
products
can
readily
turn
their
production
and
the
court
so
found,
i
mean,
there's
a
finding
of
fact
to
this
effect
in
the
--
in
the
record.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
your
honor,
i'm
--
i'm
--
the
--
the
record
shows
that
the
copper
producers
and
every
--
every
insulator
examine
his
productive
schedules
periodically
and
there's
a
finding
to
this
effect.
and
he
makes
what
he
thinks
will
bring
him
the
most
money
and
there
isn't
much
money
in
this
aluminum
wire
and
cable
products
right
now
because
the
price
competition
is
intense
in
aluminum
wire
and
cable.
but
the
court
also
found
that
anytime
they
wanted
to,
when
the
price
picture
became
right,
they
could
immediately
switch
to
making
this
aluminum
wire
and
cable
products.
and
this,
i
think
--
and
this,
of
course,
is
a
question
of
effects
but
it's
certainly
is
a
completely
limiting
effect
on
any
kind
of
--
of
market
power
that
a
manufacturer
of
aluminum
wire
and
cable
insulator
is
claimed
for
by
the
government
it
could
have.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
what
were
the
inducements?
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
well,
in
order
to
go
into
the
--
into
the
copper
field
and
get
into
the
highly
specialized
and
--
and
sophisticated
products,
such
as
the
power
cables
and
control
cables,
you
need
all
sorts
of
know-how,
technical
skills,
test
equipment,
machinery,
none
of
which
alcoa
had
and
which
the
court
found
that
they
couldn't
obtain
in
5
to
10
years.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
right.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
the
whole
embraces
the
part
but
the
part
doesn't
embrace
the
whole.
but
now,
even
assuming
that
--
that
there
may
still
be
some
merit
left
to
the
government's
position
that
price
should
be
the
only
factor
in
determining
whether
copper
and
aluminum
should
be
in
the
separate
line
of
commerce,
this
argument
has
really
no
validity.
price
--
the
price
deferential
has
not
eliminated
copper
from
this
market,
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out,
and
the
price
of
the
wire
itself
is
not
the
determinative
factor.
what
the
utility
buyer
is
interested
in
is
what
the
ultimate
as
installed
cost
of
this
wire
and
cable
is
going
to
be
and
the
cost
of
connectors,
labor
cost,
salvage
value
for
copper
wire,
all
enter
into
this
and
as
the
court
found,
i
think
it's
finding
27,
finding
28,
since
copper
and
aluminum
products
are
completely
interchangeable
from
a
--
from
a
performance
standpoint,
utility
companies
choose
between
copper
and
aluminum
insulated
or
covered
overhead
products
solely
on
the
basis
of
economics,
not
price.
the
decision
requires
evaluation
of
numerous
economic
factors
in
addition
to
the
cost
of
the
wire
or
cable
itself.
now,
these
factors,
when
they
are
taken
into
account,
sometimes
result
in
copper
winning
and
sometimes
results
in
aluminum
winning.
and
the
record
shows
that
utility
companies,
when
they're
buying
these
products,
ask
for
alternate
--
alternate
quotes
and
say,
"give
us
a
quote
in
aluminum
and
give
us
a
quote
in
copper,"
even
though
they
know
that
the
aluminum
quote
would
probably
be
somewhat
lower
that
the
copper
quote.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
i,
thus,
want
to
come
to
that,
your
honor.
the
development
has
been
and
the
record
show
that
up
to
1959,
copper
had
--
and
aluminum
supplanted
copper
to
the
extent
of
77.2%.
now,
this
evidence
was
deduct
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
on
overhead,
yes,
in
overhead.
this
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
insulated
overhead.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
now,
the
--
the
evidence
that
--
on
which
this
was
based
was
a
survey
that
was
taken
by
a
government
engineer.
in
that
survey,
the
government
engineer
asked
for
what
the
various
usages
had
been
from
1950
to
1955
and
to
1959
and
then
he
asked,
"what
is
your
prognosis
for
the
future?"
and
there
was
no
result
of
that
tabulated.
and
on
cross-examination,
he
testified
that
those
reports
were
not
susceptible
of
projection
and
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
this
trend
will
increase
beyond
1959.
further
than
that,
there
is
record
to
the
--
evidence
to
the
contrary
because
one
witness
testified
that
he
--
that
--
that
in
his
opinion,
the
balance
had
been
about
reached.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
that's
just
new
installations,
yes.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
your
honor
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
during
--
over
the
period
of
years
from
1950
to
1959.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
well,
they
took
it
in
five
year
planning.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
1950
to
1955,
1955
to
1959.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
that's
new
installations
and
the
record
shows
that
so
far
as
rome
is
concerned,
that
rome's
production
of
copper
overhead
wire
and
cable
was
three-quarters
of
its
production
of
products
for
overhead
--
insulated
products
for
overhead
distribution.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
75%
of
its
total.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
of
its
--
of
its
total
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
--
insulated
wire
and
cable
for
overhead
distribution
within
copper.
and
general
cable
company,
which
is
probably
the
largest
wire
and
cable
company
in
the
country,
testified
also
that
about
the
same
percentage
of
their
overhead
wire
and
cable
was
in
copper.
and,
in
terms
of
dollar
value
alone,
the
22%
that
remains
in
the
government
survey,
according
to
census
figures,
is
over
$15
million
so
that
to
--
to
eliminate
copper
from
this
line
of
commerce
in
the
light
of
all
of
these
factors,
i
think
is
--
it
doesn't
comport
with
the
economic
realities
of
life
and
i
think
the
district
court
very
properly
found
that
insulated
aluminum
did
not
constitute
a
line
of
commerce.
now
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
oh,
the
district
court
found
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
--
the
district
court
found,
your
honor,
and
i
was
going
to
--
get
to
this
in
the
effects
part
of
my
argument
that
there
was
active,
lively,
vigorous
competition
between
copper
and
aluminum
insulated
products.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
i
think
the
basic
reason,
your
honor,
is
that
underground
insulations
--
installation
is
--
are
basically
--
they're
insulated
and
they
--
they
are
big
and
the
extent
of
insulation
so
out
ways
the
expense
of
the
conductor
that
the
--
that
the
product
is
--
if
they
be
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
well,
there
--
there
are
various
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
there
are
--
there
are
various
degrees
of
installation
but
in
--
in
the
overhead,
i
don't
think
the
--
the
cost
to
the
insulation
is
enough
to
carry
the
day
for
copper.
whereas,
in
--
in
underground,
the
cost
of
the
insulation
and
the
fact
that
it
has
to
be
in
conduits
and
you
have
to
--
therefore,
it's
smaller
and
you
--
you
--
the
copper
is
smaller
because
you
can
use
smaller
sizes
of
the
copper
for
all
tend
to
favor
copper
in
the
underground
insulations.
and
we
don't
--
we
--
we
don't
--
we
don't
contest
this
position
of
the
government
at
all.
but
basically,
so
far
as
underground
insulations
are
concerned,
copper
is
the
--
by
far
the
predominant
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
foot
by
foot.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
on
--
on
the
insulated.
i
think
that
--
well,
i
--
i
don't
know.
no,
i'm
not
sure
because
--
because
this
is
a
--
what
--
this
is
a
product
called
self-supporting
cable
which
is
used
outside
and
is
used
for
distribution
purposes.
now,
this
is
aluminum
and
this
is
copper,
they're
both
used
for
the
same
purpose.
the
insulation
on
the
aluminum
is
much
greater
than
the
insulation
on
the
copper.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
that's
right,
that's
--
that's
quite
right.
but
alcoa
made
none
of
these
before
the
acquisition
and
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
--
that
various
companies
ask
for
alternative
quotes
on
copper
and
aluminum
self-supporting
cables
such
as
--
such
as
what
i
just
showed
you.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor.
now,
the
--
i
--
i
think,
i
said
all
that
i
--
i
need
to
say
about
the
insulated
being
a
separate
line
of
commerce.
the
other
line
of
commerce
that
the
government
contends
for
is
aluminum
conductor
wire
and
cable
and
that
includes
the
bare
and
the
insulated.
this,
it
seems
to
me,
is
nothing
more
than
an
effort,
as
i
said
before,
to
try
to
get
these
percentages
within
the
philadelphia
national
bank
percentages
because
alcoa
was
admittedly
high
in
the
bare
where
the
government
does
not
contend
that
there
has
been
any
lessening
of
competition.
and
alcoa
was
a
poor
third
in
--
in
insulated,
where
the
government
concedes
that
the
percentages
alone
are
not
enough
to
establish
a
violation
of
--
of
section
7.
now,
so
far
as
effects
are
concerned,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
order
to
determine
effects,
there
has
to
be
a
private
searching
analysis
of
market
facts
except
in
the
--
perhaps
in
the
philadelphia
national
bank
situation.
but
in
the
insulated
line
of
commerce,
which
the
government
is
talking,
and
let's
assume
that
the
government
prevails
on
aluminum
insulated
line
of
commerce,
alcoa
is
not,
as
the
government
stated
in
its
question
presented,
the
largest
producer
of
insulated
wire
and
cable.
alcoa
was
third
and
it
was
a
poor
third
because
kaiser
had
26%
and
anaconda
had
16%
and
alcoa
had
11%.
they
--
they
--
when
they
acquired
rome,
added
4%
--
4.7%
which
gave
them
a
total
of
16.3%.
now,
there
has
been
nothing
suggested
in
any
writing
by
this
court
or
by
any
of
the
economists
that
16.3%
alone
is
sufficient
to
be
determinative
of
a
substantial
lessening
of
competition.
and
in
a
case
such
as
this
--
such
as
this,
concentration
ratios,
percentages
mean
nothing
because
here,
there's
complete
ease
of
entry
as
i
said
before.
there
are
no
cost
advantages,
no
product
differentiation,
no
economies
of
scale,
no
uncertainties
so
far
as
the
new
entrant
is
concerned
and
no
time
lag.
and
there
are
significant
companies
waiting
in
the
wings,
as
mr.
cox
mentioned.
there
are
200
companies,
the
court
found,
capable
of
doing
this
and
those
companies
includes
such
companies
as
general
electric,
westinghouse,
the
united
states
steel,
phelps-dodge,
kennecott
wire
and
cable
company,
cerro
de
pasco,
all
very,
very
substantial
companies
and
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
to
believe
that
if
market
conditions
were
such,
so
that
if
alcoa
with
its
market
position
try
to
dominate,
tried
to
raise
prices,
ceased
being
an
innovator
and
laid
back
that
these
companies
would
not
come
pouring
into
this
industry
and
completely
decentralizing
it.
and
in
addition
to
that,
even
after
the
acquisition,
alcoa's
share
of
this
insulated
wire
and
--
aluminum
wire
and
cable
market
has
declined
since
the
acquisition
and
had
13
--
16.3%
in
1958
and
13%
in
1961.
and
this
increased
percentage
or
decreased
percentage
in
alcoa
went
to
the
non-integrated
fabricators
because
the
record
shows
that
the
non-integrated
fabricators
presently
in
aluminum
wire
and
cable,
increased
their
percentage
from
29%
of
the
market
to
over
33%
of
the
market
during
the
period
of
1959
and
1960
--
1958
to
1961.
they
expanded
their
facilities,
some
--
some
of
them
doubled
their
capacity
and
not
one
of
them
claimed
that
this
acquisition
had
any
adverse
effect
on
them.
now,
in
addition
to
these
factors
that
i
have
just
discussed,
the
court
in
brown
shoe
referred
to
other
factors
that
should
be
considered
in
--
in
considering
a
merger
case.
one
purpose,
what
was
alcoa's
purpose
here?
alcoa's
purpose
was
not
to
lessen
competition,
to
enhance
its
power
in
any
so-called
line
of
commerce
that
the
government
is
relying
on.
alcoa's
purpose
was
to
obtain
insulating
know-how
and
to
diversify
its
product
line.
the
other
point
that
the
court
discussed
in
brown
shoe
was
merger
trends.
the
court
in
this
case
found
that
there
was
no
significant
merger
trend.
the
merger
between
southern
electric
and
olin
mathieson
was
a
situation
where
southern
--
olin
mathieson
not
in
a
wire
and
cable
business
at
all,
acquired
a
company
to
get
into
the
wire
and
cable
business,
not
just
aluminum
wire
and
cable
business
but
the
whole
gamut
of
wire
and
cable
business.
and
the
record
shows
that
after
they
acquired
and
they
lost
position.
and
--
and
kaiser
acquired
bristol
not
because
they
needed
any
support
in
aluminum
wire
and
cable
because
they
already
had
26%
of
the
insulated
wire
and
cable
market.
they
were
interested
in
the
copper,
the
complicated
know-how,
so
that
they
could
offer
a
diversification
of
products
and
alcoa
did
it
for
the
same
purpose.
does
this
portend
a
future
trend
towards
merger?
the
record
shows
no.
the
court
found
that
it
did
not
and
alcoa
testified
when
--
when
asked
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
going
to
acquire
another
company
in
this
field,
its
executive
vice
president
said,
"no,
we
already
got
what
we've
wanted.
we've
got
the
know-how
and
we're
not
going
--
we're
not
about
to
buy
it
twice."
so
that
there
is
no
purpose
here
such
as
there
was
in
brown
shoe
to
dry
up
outlets
or
to
--
to
enhance
market
position
in
the
so-called
aluminum
wire
and
cable
--
wire
and
cable
product.
the
purpose
was
to
be
able
to
serve
--
for
alcoa
to
be
able
to
serve
its
customers
as
well
as
its
competitors
were
able
to
serve
it
because
its
competitors
were
all
able
to
offer
wire
and
cable
products.
now,
just
one
other
thought,
the
government
in
its
brief
suggests
that
there
should
be
a
simplified
test
for
deciding
merger
cases.
and
therefore,
when
you
--
when
you
have
the
--
the
largest
and
it
acquires
some
percentage
no
matter
how
small
it
is
if
--
if
you
get
up
within
a
certain
range,
the
--
the
merger
should
automatically
be
unlawful.
and
they
say
that
the
reason
for
that
is
that
businessmen
need
certainty
and
the
government
needs
certainty
and
that
they
want
to
avoid
long
complicated
trial.
well,
in
the
first
place,
this
case
was
not
a
long
complicated
trial.
we
tried
this
case
in
15
days
and
in
those
15
days,
we
discussed
9
--
10
lines
of
commerce,
not
just
the
two
that
are
here
on
appeal.
and
i
think
that
we
were
able
to
develop
a
record
so
that
a
realistic
determination
can
be
made
as
to
whether
or
not
this
acquisition
has
any
anticompetitive
effects
and
not
a
situation
where
you
have
to
rely
on
mere
numbers
alone
where
the
numbers
we
demonstrate
--
we
--
we
suggest
are
meaningless.
and
even
--
even
if
you
could
use
numbers
in
this
case,
you
still
would
not
have
eliminated
the
question
of
what
constituted
the
line
of
commerce
because
the
numbers
mean
only
--
mean
something
only
if
you
have
a
well-defined
line
of
commerce.
and
here,
you
have
no
line
of
commerce.
you
have
a
dispute
as
to
the
line
of
commerce,
so
that
there
would
be
no
opportunity
whatsoever
for
the
businessman
to
apply
a
simplified
test
here
because
how
is
the
businessman
going
to
know
how
the
government
is
going
to
draw
the
line
of
commerce
and
then
apply
its
numbers?
so
that
i
suggest
that
--
that
the
only
way
that
a
section
7
case
can
be
treated,
a
case
of
this
kind
and
i
think
this
case
is
--
is
somewhat
unique,
is
that
you
must
examine
it
all
in
--
in
the
light
of
all
the
facts
and
i
submit
that
this
is
what
the
district
court
did
and
the
district
court
made
well
reason,
fought
for
comprehensive
findings
of
fact.
and
as
a
result
of
those
findings
of
fact,
came
of
the
conclusion
that
this
acquisition
did
not
lessen
competition
and
i
submit
that
your
honors
--
ask
your
honors
to
affirm.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
no,
no.
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
no,
i
don't
--
what
i
want
to
put
into
the
line
of
commerce,
your
honor,
is
those
suppliers
who
are
capable
of
producing
the
copper
wire
--
i
mean,
the
--
the
aluminum
wire
and
cable
products
that
are
used
for
overhead
purposes.
in
other
words,
our
--
our
position
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bergson
we
will
eliminate
the
copper
but
we
won't
eliminate
the
manufacturers
--
manufacturers
of
the
copper
for
underground
use
because
we
say
that
they
could
--
are
capable
overnight
of
producing
the
--
the
aluminum
wire
and
cable
for
--
for
overhead
use.
in
other
words,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
saying,
your
honor,
that
--
that
you
must
include
within
this
line
of
commerce
every
--
every
piece
of
copper
product
whichever
--
for
whatever
purpose
it's
used.
what
i'm
saying
is
that,
in
addition
to
--
to
the
--
the
product
problem,
you
also
have
the
supply
problem
and
that
you
have
suppliers
here
who
are
capable
with
complete
ease
of
entry,
of
coming
in
here
and
--
and
producing
the
--
the
product
that
--
that
the
government
claims
is
in
the
line
of
commerce.
