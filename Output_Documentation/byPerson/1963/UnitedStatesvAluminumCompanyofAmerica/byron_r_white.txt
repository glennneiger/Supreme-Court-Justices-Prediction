justice
byron
r.
white
but
before
you
leave
that
question,
why
wasn't
the
district
court
said
insulated
aluminum
was
not
a
separate
submarket?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
certainly
insulated
conductors
are
part
of
some
market?
justice
byron
r.
white
sometime
--
and
--
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
then
what
did
he
say
--
and
what
did
the
district
judge
say
of
insulated
aluminum
products
were
a
part
of
what
market?
justice
byron
r.
white
copper
and
aluminum
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
i
gather
then
your
case
does
rest
on
--
on
being
able
to
establish
insulated
aluminum
as
a
separate
submarket.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
if
--
if
it
--
if
the
district
judge
was
correct
in
---
in
--
that
insulated
aluminum
was
not
a
submarket,
it
isn't
going
to
help
you
any
to
--
you
can't
then
argue
that
bare
and
insulated
aluminum
is
at
the
market.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
to
what
extent
is
insulated
aluminum
used
overhead?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
to
what
extent
is
insulated
aluminum
used
overhead?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
--
we
wrangle
about
the
way
of
commerce
just
for
a
moment,
you
do
accept
the
findings
below
that
--
that
covered
aluminum
and
covered
copper
cable
competition
that
the
district
court
held?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
still
20
--
it's
still
22%
of
--
of
those
overhead
installations
using
covered
cable
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
of
course,
where
that's
what
--
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that's
what
we're
arguing
about
is
cover
and
the
new
--
of
new
installations
which
are
made
with
insulated
conductor,
22%
is
still
made
with
the
copper.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
10%
has
been
more
and
more
aluminum
but
nevertheless,
copper
is
still
in
the
--
is
still
in
the
picture
even
in
new
installations.
and
i
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
--
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
that's
right.
now,
i
--
i
think
that
the
dividing
line
as
--
as
installation
becomes
heavier
and
the
conductors
are
proper,
it
becomes
more
competitive.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
--
i
mean
more
substantial
installation.
i
told
the
difference
between
some
installations
or
another.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
more
insulation
you
need,
while
the
more
competitive
copper
becomes,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
more
expensive
the
insulation
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
more
--
the
more
competitive
copper
becomes?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
that
point
at
which
these
--
these
two
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
(voice
overlap)
to
be
in
substantial
competition
it
seems
to
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that's
true
in
the
east
coast,
why
would
they
ever
put
them?
why
--
why
would
any
new
installation
ever
put
copper
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
east
coast
where
you
do
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
have
covered
for
your
conductors?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
bergson,
do
you
--
you
--
i
gather
that
solicitor
general
said
that
if
he
didn't
make
out
on
just
insulated
aluminum
as
a
line
of
commerce
that
he
probably
couldn't
make
out
on
bare
and
aluminum
--
bare
and
insulated
together,
didn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
insulated
necessary
--
i
mean
--
and
what
make
insulation
necessary
in
an
overhead
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
then
that
all
you
need
is
insulation
and
for
overhead
purposes,
there's
no
difference
in
the
kind
of
insulation
required
for
the
degree.
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
difference
of
price
of
those
two?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nevertheless
--
nevertheless,
it's
35%
to
40%
--
one
piece
there
is
35%
to
40%
more
expensive.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
some
of
the
things.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
present
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
alcoa
didn't
use
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
--
you
don't
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
then
that
the
district
court
made
it
clean
what
it
said
about
competition.
is
there
really
is
competition
between
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
copper
and
aluminum?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
it
that
--
why
is
it
that
copper
has
maintained
itself
for
underground
insulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there's
just
one
way
that
--
of
installation
for
--
for
overhead.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
you
need
to
be
is
