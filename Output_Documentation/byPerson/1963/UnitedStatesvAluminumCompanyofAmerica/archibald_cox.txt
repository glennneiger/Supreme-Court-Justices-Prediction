mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
by
the
united
states
from
a
judgment
of
the
district
court
in
the
northern
district
of
new
york
or
the
western
district
perhaps,
dismissing
the
complaint
in
an
action
under
section
7
of
the
sherman
act.
the
case
is
one
of
unusual
importance
because
of
a
trend
that
seems
to
us
to
have
developed
in
the
metals
industries
in
recent
years,
for
the
large
basic
integrated
companies
to
acquire
smaller
independent
fabricators
in
an
effort
to
expand
into
other
related
and
sometimes
competitive
basis
of
the
industry.
we
have
a
number
of
cases
pending
at
that
time
in
an
effort
to
arrest
the
trend,
thinking
that
it
violates
section
7.
here,
the
acquiring
company
is
the
aluminum
company
of
america,
the
giant
of
the
aluminum
industry.
the
acquired
company
was
rome
cable
corporation,
a
strong
independent
manufacturer
of
chiefly
insulated
wire
and
cable,
both
aluminum
and
copper,
for
use
by
electric
light
and
power
companies
in
the
transmission
and
distribution
of
electricity.
the
essential
facts,
the
questions
being
the
same
as
in
all
in
section
7
cases,
the
essential
facts
may
be
summarized
as
follows.
alcoa,
as
i
say,
is
the
giant
of
the
aluminum
industry
until
world
war
ii,
of
course,
it
acquired
--
it
had
a
monopoly.
after
the
war,
the
united
states
disposed
of
the
aluminum
facilities
that
it
had
constructed
in
such
a
way
that
kaiser
and
reynolds
entered
the
field
as
fully
integrated
producers
of
aluminum
and
aluminum
products.
since
1950,
three
somewhat
smaller
producers
have
entered
the
field
but
this
is
still
an
industry
of
few
concerns
with
great
economic
power.
the
big
three
have
90%
of
the
ingot
capacity,
alcoa
with
38%
of
the
ingot
capacity,
is
almost
50%
bigger
than
any
other.
in
addition,
as
the
court
i'm
sure
knows,
alcoa
owns
and
operates
mining
locations,
railroads,
steamship
lines,
basic
aluminum
plants,
rolling
mills,
many
facilities
for
producing
fabricated
aluminum
down
to
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
one
must
envisage
this
case
not
simply
as
the
market
for
conducting
but
its
relation
to
the
overall
aluminum
industry
that
you
can't
forget
the
industry
as
a
whole.
i
would
think
that
was
while
background,
one
of
the
dominating
facts
and
that's
just
only
importance
but
a
very
great
importance,
i
think,
in
the
overall
picture
of
the
power
of
the
acquiring
company.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
would
submit
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
we
would
submit
that
the
--
but
i'd
--
we
would
submit
that
the
economic
power
of
the
acquiring
company
in
closely
related
fields
has
a
bearing
on
its
power
in
any
particular
market
and
that
when
while
he
must
appraise
the
particular
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
market
cannot
wholly
forget
the
fact
of
the
background
in
which
the
question
arises
and
now,
the
immediate
facts,
the
decisive
facts,
of
course,
have
to
do
with
the
conductor
field.
one
of
the
major
end
uses
of
aluminum
is
in
wire
and
cable
for
conducting
electricity.
it's
about
7%
of
the
ingot
capacity
goes
into
that
area.
originally,
of
course,
copper
was
the
favorite
conductor
of
electricity.
and
for
many
purposes,
copper
today
has
such
a
marked
advantage,
technological
advantage
that
aluminum
cannot
compete
with
it.
aluminum,
as
i
will
explain
later
in
more
detail,
has
a
very
marked
economic
advantage
in
use
for
overhead
wire
and
cable,
except
in
coastal
areas
where
the
problems
of
corrosion.
and
as
a
result,
aluminum
has
rapidly
displaced
copper
for
overhead
use.
today,
nearly
95%
of
the
installations
of
bare
transmission
line
are
of
aluminum.
about
80%
of
the
installations
of
bare
distribution
line
are
of
aluminum.
as
an
aluminum
--
as
an
insulated
overhead
conductor
too,
aluminum
is
--
is
rapture
--
rapidly
capturing
the
field.
in
1950,
only
about
6.5%
of
the
new
installations
were
made
of
aluminum.
in
1955,
51%
of
the
insulated
overhead
installations
were
of
aluminum
and
in
1959,
the
line
had
gone
still
farther
up
and
it
was
77
and
a
fraction
percent.
alcoa
has
been
the
dominant
fabricator
and
seller
of
both
types
of
aluminum
overhead
conductor.
its
percentage
of
the
market
has
declined
as
a
result
of
the
government
policy
in
breaking
the
monopoly
in
setting
up
for
kaiser
and
reynolds.
but
it
is
still
a
fact
that
in
1958,
the
year
prior
to
the
merger,
alcoa
sold
32.5%
of
the
bare
aluminum
conductor,
ranking
first,
and
11.6%
of
the
insulated
aluminum
conductor,
ranking
third.
taking
the
two
together
as
a
measure
in
these
related
lines
alcoa
sold
27.8%
of
all
aluminum
conductor
more
than
any
other
company.
shortly
before
the
merger,
alcoa's
officials
began
to
worry
about
maintaining
what
they
called
its
number
one
spot
in
the
aluminum
conductor
field
especially
because
kaiser,
its
chief
competitor,
had
acquired
the
wire
and
cable
facilities
of
u.s.
rubber
company,
a
merger
that
is
also
under
attack
under
section
7.
alcoa,
being
heavily
in
the
bare
field,
lacked
a
full
line
of
aluminum
wire,
both
bare
and
insulated
and
especially
the
insulated.
and
it
felt
that
this
weakness
interfered
with
its
maintaining
or
expanding
its
already
very
great
share
of
the
market.
alcoa
could
have
obtained
a
full
line
of
course
either
by
internal
expansion,
building
its
own
facilities
and
acquiring
the
know-how
or
by
a
merger.
it
preferred
a
merger
as
easier,
less
expensive,
quicker
and
is
not
merely
as
obnoxious
to
other
companies
in
the
wire
and
cable
industry.
one
of
its
officials,
discussing
the
feeling
of
the
industry,
wrote
a
memorandum
that's
rather
interesting.
acquisitions
and
mergers,
he
said,
have
the
common
denominator
of
not
adding
to
existing
capacity
in
the
industry
and
everybody
in
the
industry
is
very
conscious
of
the
fact
that
the
entire
industry
would
be
much
more
healthy
if
each
manufacturer
were
to
talk
about
two
--
were
to
toss
about
two
thirds
of
its
equipment
into
the
atlantic
ocean.
rome,
the
acquired
company,
had
begun
business
in
the
1930s
as
a
fabricator
of
copper
conductor,
wire
and
cable.
it
grew
gradually
and
became
one
of
the
largest
insulators.
its
business
was
--
became
one
of
the
largest
companies
in
the
combined
fields
but
its
business
was
very
heavily
in
the
insulated
field.
its
technical
skill,
its
research
facilities,
its
reputation
for
know-how
and
ability
in
insulation
had
made
it
one
of
the
outstanding
companies.
as
the
use
of
aluminum
grew,
rome,
naturally,
moved
into
the
aluminum
field.
it
was
--
also
it
remained,
i
should
say,
a
predominantly
a
copper
fabricator.
the
ratio
according
to
a
footage
of
line
was
about
25%
aluminum
in
--
in
dollar
volume,
the
copper
was
90%
and
the
aluminum
10%
as
i
recall.
mr.
archibald
cox
rome,
in
the
bare
aluminum
field,
was
a
very
small
percentage,
less
than
1%.
in
terms
of
the
insulated
aluminum
conductors,
rome
was
4.7%.
and
as
you
see
in
the
latter
field,
the
insulated
field,
what
the
merger
did
was
bring
together
the
third
and
eighth
ranking
companies,
giving
them
16%
of
the
market.
and
if
you
put
this,
i
shall
argue,
was
appropriate
for
many
purposes.
the
bare
and
insulated
fields
together,
you
find
that
the
combined
companies
have
just
a
tiny
bit
under
30%
of
the
market.
the
department
of
justice
attacked
the
merger
as
a
violation
of
section
7
and
the
case
was
tried
as
the
size
of
the
record
shows
in
some
length.
the
evidence
covers
many
aspects
of
the
aluminum
business,
especially
aluminum
wire
and
cable,
but
our
focus
is
now
confined
to
the
sale
of
overhead
aluminum
conductors.
the
government's
theory
then
and
especially
now
that
we
have
focused
it
is
that
the
acquisition
may
tend
substantially
lessen
competition
in
that
area,
overhead
aluminum
conductor,
whether
the
market
be
defined
as
insulated
aluminum
conductors
or
simply
as
all
overhead
aluminum
conductor
both
wire
--
both
bare
and
insulated.
and
i
shall
talk
about
both
in
the
relation
between
what
my
argument
progresses.
the
district
court
ruled
against
the
government
on
all
point,
specifically,
it
held
that
neither
insulated
aluminum
conductor
nor
all
aluminum
conductor,
both
bare
and
insulated,
was
an
appropriate
line
of
commerce
for
the
purposes
of
section
7,
then
the
court
went
on
and
held
that
the
government
had
failed
to
show
that
the
merger
might
substantially
lessen
competition
in
either
of
those
areas
assuming
that
to
be
appropriate
lines
in
commerce.
so
our
appeal
brings
here
both
the
threshold
questions
concerning
the
line
of
commerce
and
also
the
question
of
substantial
lessening
of
competition
or
rather
i
should
say,
a
tendency
substantially
lessened
competition.
mr.
archibald
cox
there's
no
sherman
act
question
on
this
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
yes,
before
that,
before
el
paso.
we
do,
i
should
say,
disagree
with
a
considerable
number
of
the
characterizations
and
conclusions
reached
by
the
district
court.
but
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say,
although
perhaps
not
literally
accurate,
that
the
essence
of
our
case
here
as
in
el
paso
is
that
on
the
undisputed
facts,
it
must
be
held,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
the
acquisition
violated
section
7.
on
the
threshold
questions,
whether
insulated
aluminum
conductor
or
all
aluminum
conductor
both
bare
and
insulated
for
overhead
use,
is
a
proper
line
of
commerce.
the
issue
is
rather
narrowly
drawn.
the
parties
agreed
and
the
district
court
held
that
it
was
proper
to
look
--
to
lump
both
bare
and
insulated
conductors
together
as
one
line
of
commerce,
speaking
of
both
copper
and
aluminum.
and
also,
that
it
is
proper
to
lump
together
and
that
also,
it
is
proper
to
look
at
the
insulated
conductors
separately.
the
real
question
here,
therefore,
is
whether
aluminum
and
copper
conductors
must
be
lumped
together
in
determining
whether
this
acquisition
may
lessen
competition
in
any
line
of
commerce
or
whether
aluminum,
either
taking
all
overhead
conductors
or
taking
only
the
insulated
overhead
conductor,
belongs
in
one
field
and
copper
belongs
in
another
separate
field.
even
upon
that
narrow
issue,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
facts
are
essentially
undisputed.
functionally,
either
copper
or
aluminum
can
be
used
for
insulated
conductors.
it's
also
true
that
most
industrial
classifications
speak
of
wire
and
cable
companies
or
conductors
or
insulated
conductors
without
distinguishing
between
those
made
of
aluminum
and
those
made
of
copper.
a
number
of
companies
make
both.
utilities
use
both,
although
by
no
means
always
interchangeably
refer
often
for
different
purposes,
although
they
can
be
used
interchangeably.
it
is
technically
easy
or
technologically
easy
i
should
say,
for
a
company
that
is
using
its
equipment
to
make
copper
wire
and
to
use
it
to
make
aluminum
wire.
there
is
no
serious
problem
in
the
adjustment.
those
are
the
facts,
of
course,
upon
which
the
appellees
very
heavily
rely
and
upon
which
the
district
court
rests.
what
we
emphasize
is
that
in
terms
of
cost
for
overhead
uses,
aluminum
enjoys
such
a
very
marked
advantage
over
copper
that
the
two
types
of
conductors
are
not
competitive
in
any
proper
sense
of
the
word.
purchasers
make
their
choice
solely
on
the
basis
of
cost
in
this
area,
no
matter
of
style
or
quality.
the
price
of
insulated
aluminum
conductor
is
only
50%
to
65%
of
the
price
of
equally
conductive
copper.
now,
the
initial
shift
from
using
exclusively
copper
to
making
some
new
installations
of
aluminum
does
involve
collateral
expenses
because
there's
certain
differences
in
technique
in
doing
the
work,
certain
different
tools
are
needed
and
their
problems
of
connecting
aluminum
to
copper.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
says
that
some
kind
of
galvanic
or
corrosive
action
between
--
mr.
archibald
cox
between
the
two
metals.
mr.
archibald
cox
although
i
should
say
there
has
recently
been
a
device
invented
which
referred
to
in
some
of
the
testimony
that
very
greatly
diminishes
that
problem
at
least
in
the
use
of
what
they
call
"drop
cable",
it
was
running
off
from
the
street
lines
for
the
housing
so
that
aluminum's
advantage
becomes
even
greater.
despite
these
problems,
it's
quite
clear
that
aluminum
has
such
cost
advantages
for
overhead
use
that
it
is
practically
pushing
copper
out
of
the
area.
as
i
said
before,
insulated
aluminum
cable
was
only
6%
of
the
new
installations
in
1950,
it
was
about
50%,
51.6%
in
1955
and
now,
it's
in
excess
of
77%.
it
just
shows
that
for
many,
many
purposes,
there
is
no
useful
cost
interrelationship.
and
of
course,
the
more
aluminum
that
is
strung,
the
less
the
collateral
cost
become
and
the
problem
of
connecting
will
become
and
the
greater
should
the
aluminum's
cost
advantage
assuming
that
other
things
remain
equally.
since
the
prices
of
copper
and
aluminum
do
not
respond
to
each
other
and
that
is
exceeded
and
since
aluminum
has
this
great
cost
advantage,
the
availability
of
copper
is
a
functional
substitute,
can't
meaningfully
influence
the
behavior
of
insulated
--
of
companies
in
the
insulated
aluminum
conductor
field.
and
that
is
the
crux
of
the
matter
from
an
antitrust
point
of
few.
putting
it
conversely,
buyers
of
insulated
aluminum
would
find
little
comfort
in
the
functional
substitutability
of
copper
if
the
result
of
the
increased
concentration
in
the
aluminum,
insulated
aluminum
conductor
market,
where
that
quality
deteriorated
or
didn't
continue
to
improve
or
that
prices
were
raised.
we
think,
therefore,
that
this
great
difference
resulting
from
differences
in
price,
the
reflected
differences
in
cost
justifies
treating
the
two
as
different
markets.
and
the
lower
courts,
in
other
cases
cited
in
our
brief,
have
quite
generally
recognized
that
where
there
is
a
marked
difference
in
cost
or
price
that
even
though
the
two
are
otherwise
interchangeable,
that
it
justifies
the
finding
of
--
as
a
separate
market.
i
may
say
that
in
arguing
that
aluminum
is
separate
from
copper,
we
do
really
no
more
than
imply
a
usage
that
is
been
implied
by
the
officials
of
both
alcoa
and
rome
and
by
others
in
the
industry
depressed
to
develop
alcoa
in
talking
about
negotiations
with
rome,
spoke
of
their
importance
in
alcoa's
further
development
in
the
insulated
aluminum
wire
and
cable
business.
and
in
another
memorandum,
he
spoke
of
the
number
one
spot
in
the
aluminum
conductor
field
distinguishing
that
from
becoming
a
factor
in
the
copper
field.
a
sales
executive
at
rome
wrote
a
memorandum
expressing
some
thoughts
and
observations
on
the
insulated
aluminum
market
and
another
alcoa
official
referring
to
the
effective
kaiser's
purchase
placing
them
in
severe
jeopardy
of
a
proper
share
of
the
aluminum
cable
market.
rome
again
expressed
within
a
speech,
spoke
of
the
aluminum
covered
wire
business
and
the
vice
president
of
southwire
company,
another
company
in
the
area,
when
he
was
questioned
by
mr.
bergson
replied,
"aluminum
wasn't
fighting
with
copper.
we,
southwire,
were
fighting
for
our
position
in
the
aluminum
industry."
so
there's
nothing
strange
or
noble
about
our
distinction.
the
--
the
other
market,
which
we
think
is
important,
is
the
position
of
aluminum
overhead
conductors
taken
as
a
whole,
whether
bare
or
insulated
and
i'll
deal
with
that
briefly
after
lunch.
may
it
please
the
court,
just
before
the
recess,
i've
called
attention
in
fact
that
in
addition
to
arguing
that
insulated
aluminum
conductors
are
an
appropriate
line
of
commerce,
we
also
urge
that
all
aluminum
conductors
for
overhead
use,
both
bare
and
insulated,
should
be
regarded
as
an
appropriate
line
of
commerce.
the
chief
objection,
not
the
only
one,
but
the
chief
objection
to
this,
raised
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court,
was
that
it
was
not
proper
to
separate
aluminum
from
copper.
and
as
i
have
tried
to
show,
it
seems
to
us
that
that
separation
is
not
only
proper
but
for
this
purpose,
necessary
and
that
when
that
objection
falls
then
the
objection
to
treating
all
aluminum
conductors,
both
bare
and
insulated
as
a
line
of
commerce,
falls
with
it.
the
appellees
object
to
our
use
of
figures
for
aluminum
conductors
generally,
saying
that
it's
a
statistical
trick.
of
course,
there's
no
trick.
the
figures
for
all
aluminum
conductors
are
--
are
obviously
composite
figures
and
they're
obviously
figures
for
products
that
are
not
completely
interchangeable
in
their
use.
breaking
them
down,
one
finds,
as
i
said
before
that
alcoa's
share
of
the
bare
aluminum
conductor
market
was
over
32%
at
the
time
of
acquisition.
although,
rome
was
small
that
in
the
insulated
aluminum
conductor
market,
alcoa
had
11.6%
and
rome
had
4.7%.
and
we
think
our
case
is
made,
submit
that
it
is
made,
upon
those
figures
but
it
does
seem
--
mr.
archibald
cox
this
--
that
is
for
bare
aluminum
conductors.
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
appears
in
the
--
in
the
brief.
the
--
the
figure
is
32
point
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
for
the
two
together,
mr.
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
for
the
two
together.
we're
talking
in
a
sense
about
three
sets
of
figures
here,
insulated
aluminum
conductors
and
bare
aluminum
conductors
which
are
subdivisions
and
then
the
two
added
together,
combined.
and
the
reason
we
combined
them
that
i
don't
want
to
be
guilty
of
any
statistical
trick,
the
reason
we
combined
things,
which
in
a
sense
are
oranges
and
lemons,
is
that
they
are
both
parts
of
what
appellees
repeatedly
referred
to
as
a
full
line
and
they
say
it's
necessary
to
have
a
full
line
that
you
can't
do
very
well
in
selling
bare
aluminum
conductor
unless
you're
in
a
position
to
offer
insulated
aluminum
conductor.
and
they
say
a
stress,
if
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
for
this
acquisition.
but
now,
we
say
by
the
same
token,
their
economic
power
either
in
the
bare
field
or
in
the
insulated
field
can
best
be
judged
but
--
by
what
they
are
in
both
together.
and
the
best
measure
we
have
of
both
together
is
these
composite
figures
which
credits
like
you
might
speak
of
the
fruit
or
citrus
fruit
line
depends
ability
to
sell
oranges
and
certainly
if
retails
affected
by
whether
each
got
lemons
on
the
counter.
and
to
get
his
overall
position,
it's
a
good
thing
to
measure
what
he
has
in
the
two
combined.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
combined
rome
and
alcoa
appears
on
page
19
of
our
brief,
mr.
justice
clark.
in
the
--
well,
we
go
to
one
that
are
combined.
we've
got
to
decide
which
we're
talking
about.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
insulated,
those
appear
on
page
20.
alcoa
is
11.6%
and
rome
is
4.7%
with
the
combined
just
about
16%.
just
one
thing
more,
i
would
like
to
say
about
this
question
of
--
of
the
market
or
line
of
commerce.
the
district
court
appears
to
have
been
concerned
that
it
could
not
find
all
conductors,
aluminum
or
copper
to
be
a
line
of
commerce
and
also
to
regard
aluminum
conductors,
either
subdivision,
as
a
line
of
commerce
and
faced
with
the
feeling
that
it
must
be
one
or
the
other.
it
shows
to
take
the
two
together.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
that
is
quite
inconsistent
with
the
teaching
of
brown
shoe
and
the
philadelphia
bank
case
and
indeed,
earlier
cases,
that
the
chief
justice
very
clearly
pointed
out
in
brown
shoe
that
whereas
for
many
purposes,
one
must
define
the
market
broadly
to
include
all
the
reasonably
interchangeable
substitutes
still
within
that
broad
market.
there
might
very
well
be
a
number
of
economically
significant
submarkets
and
then
he
went
on
to
point
out
that
because
section
7
prohibits
an
acquisition
that
may
substantially
lessen
competition
in
any
line
of
commerce
that
one
must
locate
each
of
the
economically
significant
submarkets
as
well
as
the
broad
one
and
that
if
there
was
that
prohibited
effect
in
one
of
the
economically
significant
submarkets,
then
it
didn't
matter
whether
in
the
broader
market,
there
was
an
effect
or
not.
and
this
goes
back
at
least
as
far
as
278
u.s.
in
van
camp
&
sons
against
the
american
can
company,
wherein
a
passage
quoted
by
justice
brennan
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case,
the
court
said
the
phrase
was
comprehensive
and
means
that
if
the
forbidden
effect
or
tendency
is
produced
in
anyone
out
of
all
the
various
lines
of
commerce,
the
words
in
any
line
of
commerce
literally
are
satisfied.
and
that's
essentially
our
position
here.
that
brings
me
to
the
question
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
first,
because
it
felt
the
--
it
--
it
had
to
choose
that
it
had
to
be
either
the
broad
all
insulated
conductor
or
separate
insulated
aluminum
conductor.
it
felt
it
put
to
choice
which
we
say
it
wasn't
put
to.
it
would
prefer
the
broader
line.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
yes
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
insulated
conductors
i
would
say
were
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
of
insulated
conductor.
mr.
archibald
cox
copper
and
aluminum
combined.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
depends
on
our
being
able
to
separate
aluminum
from
copper
very
largely,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
seem
to
me
that
our
case
was
no
better
on
bare
and
insulated
together
than
it
is
on
insulated
alone,
i
would
think
so
about
it.
we
do
relies,
i
said
before
lunch,
on
this
great
price
difference
on
the
very
fact
that
the
aluminum
is
for
overhead
use,
it's
just
pushing
copper
out,
5%,
five
years
later,
50%,
four
years
later,
77%.
and
as
the
president
of
southwire
said,
"we
aren't
fighting
with
copper.
we're
fighting
for
our
share
of
the
aluminum
market."
mr.
archibald
cox
what?
excuse
me.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
in
insulated
aluminum,
it
is
used
to
the
extent
of
77%
of
the
new
installations.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
what
went
from
5%
base
--
i
was
speaking
a
moment
ago
of
insulated
aluminum.
it
went
from
5%
to
50%
in
five
years
to
77%
another
four
years
later.
that's
--
it's
the
big
one
in
the
insulated
overhead.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
--
but
i
--
but
i
come
to
that
in
just
--
in
just
one
moment
because
i
do
intend
to
call
attention
to
those
figures
and
i
think
it'll
save
a
little
time
to
fit
them
in.
we
come
here,
as
i
say,
to
the
question
whether
this
acquisition
may
substantially
lessen
competition
in
overhead
aluminum
conductors.
our
answer
is
that
this
is
just
such
an
acquisition
as
section
7
was
directed
at.
that
this
isn't
a
peripheral
matter,
the
next
to
a
case
like
the
brown
shoe
case,
this
is
the
very
core
of
the
trend
that
section
7
was
intended
to
arrest.
the
house
committee
reports
in
describing
the
problem,
said
the
outstanding
characteristic
of
the
merger
movement
that
section
7
was
intended
to
arrest
has
been
that
of
larger
corporations
buying
out
small
companies
rather
than
small
companies
getting
together
so
that
they
could
compete
more
directly
with
the
large
ones.
and
the
senate
committee
explained
that
the
problem
was
as
a
larger
corporation
grows
through
a
series
of
small
acquisitions,
its
accretions
of
economic
power
are
individually
so
minute
as
to
make
it
difficult
to
use
the
sherman
act
against
it.
and
it
proposed
section
7
as
a
preventative
for
that
evil.
now,
the
core
of
this
case
is
that
a
very
large
firm
in
the
number
one
spot,
as
its
president
said
in
the
aluminum
conductor
field,
has
enhanced
its
power
of
buying
--
by
buying
up
one
of
the
rather
few
substantial
independence
in
a
field
in
which
economic
power
is
already
heavily
concentrated.
it's
--
i
come
to
demonstrate
those
facts
and
i
think
it
could
be
done
very
quickly.
it
can
hardly
begin
said
that
alcoa,
just
prior
to
the
merger,
was
in
the
number
one
spot
in
the
aluminum
conductor
field
taking
the
two
together
or
that
its
acquisition
eliminated
a
substantial
independence.
now,
take
first
to
fill
in
the
details,
the
simple
figure
showing
the
sales
of
insulated
aluminum
conductor
in
the
last
year
prior
to
the
merger,
that's
on
page
20,
mr.
justice
clark,
which
were
the
figures
that
you
asked
for
a
moment
ago.
you'll
note
that
the
top
three
companies,
kaiser,
anaconda
and
alcoa
had
between
them
55.3%
of
the
insulated
aluminum
conductor
with
alcoa
being
third.
alcoa
acquired
the
eighth
ranking
company
rome
with
4.7%
of
the
market.
alcoa's
share
went
up
40%
and
the
share
of
the
big
three
went
up
almost
10%,
about
9%.
so
much
for
insulated
by
itself
because
i
suggested
before,
in
view
of
the
importance
of
a
full
line
as
we
are
told
by
the
appellees,
alcoa's
dominant
position
can
hardly
be
judged
by
taking
insulated
alone.
taking
bare
aluminum,
which
is
--
would
seem
to
be
the
nearest
thing
in
a
full
line,
one
finds,
and
these
figures
are
in
the
record
but
not
in
our
brief,
that
alcoa
was
first
with
32.5%
of
bare
aluminum,
kaiser
was
second,
with
22%
and
anaconda
third
with
15.5%.
rome
share
of
bare
aluminum
was
less
than
1%,
it
was
small
in
that.
but
it's
worth
nothing
that
here,
the
three
companies
that
had
55%
of
the
insulated
field
are
now
the
top
three
with
70%
of
the
bare
field
and
that
alcoa
is
here
the
first
with
almost
a
third
of
the
market
itself.
then
bearing
in
mind,
the
necessity
of
getting
a
composite
picture
because
of
the
relationship
between
these
two
products
and
the
necessity
of
the
full
line,
we
turn
to
the
combined
sales
of
insulated
and
bare
which
is
set
forth
on
page
19
of
the
brief.
there
you
will
see,
and
these
perhaps
are
the
most
important
figures,
they
say
in
big
three,
alcoa
this
time
in
the
lead
with
27.8%,
kaiser
with
23.1%
and
anaconda
with
15.8%
or
between
the
three,
65%
of
the
market
and
rome
in
the
combined
figures
comes
in
as
a
substantial
firm
with
1.3%
of
the
market
give
when
--
so
that
when
alcoa
and
rome
are
put
together,
you
have
29.1%
of
the
market
in
the
hands
of
the
single
company.
i
suggest
that
even
there,
the
cold
figures
hardly
tell
the
whole
story,
that
the
power
of
alcoa
and
the
other
dominant
firms
in
the
conductor
field
can't
be
fairly
measured
just
by
their
shares,
statistical
share
of
the
conductor
field,
without
regard
to
the
fact
that
they
are
the
big
integrated
companies
that
dominate
the
whole
industry.
and
i
would
agree
that
whether
it's
a
railroad
or
a
steamship
line,
it
doesn't
matter
but
it's
the
fact
that
it's
an
integrated
company.
it
would
certainly
be
important
to
me
if
i
were
buying
into
the
aluminum
conductor
area
myself
and
i
should
suppose
is,
therefore,
important
from
a
public
point
of
view.
the
point
is
that
the
added
accretion
in
the
aluminum
conductor
line
of
commerce
for
overhead
use
is
an
accretion
to
still
larger
concentrations
that
goes
through
the
whole
industry.
it
is
not
insignificant,
though
not
very
important
in
this
--
that
in
this
area,
alcoa
went
out
and
bought
the
cupples
manufacturing
company,
another
fabricator,
not
of
wire
but
of
aluminum
sides
and
doors
and
things
like
that,
another
case
under
attack
under
section
7.
it
said
here
that
alcoa
can't
be
characterized
as
a
leading
or
dominant
firm
because
her
share
of
these
markets
and
other
markets
has
been
declined.
that's
unquestionably
true.
it's
declining,
of
course,
because
she's
lost
her
monopoly
because
kaiser
and
reynolds
were
set
up
and
she
is
now
finding
her
place
having
lost
her
exclusive
position.
but
we
do
submit
that
the
fact
that
she
once
had
a
monopoly
that
she's
now
lost,
doesn't
give
her
any
privilege
to
try
to
hold
on
to
as
much
of
the
market
as
she
can.
while
she's
still
a
dominant
firm,
it
doesn't
except
her
from
section
7,
she
is
surely
subject
to
the
same
test
that
kaiser
or
any
other
dominant
firm
would
be
having
the
position
that
alcoa
now
has
in
the
market.
not
only
does
the
present
case
seem
to
us
to
be
typical
of
what
congress
was
thinking
about
as
described
by
the
congressional
committees
but
i
submit
that
it
falls
well
within
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court.
in
the
brown
shoe
case,
the
court
held
that
for
a
shoe
manufacturer,
which
was
the
fourth
largest,
to
--
with
about
4%
of
the
market,
to
acquire
a
retail
chain,
it
was
something
like
1.2%
of
the
market,
was
a
violation
of
section
7
because
of
the
amount
of
the
market
that
would
be
foreclosed
by
the
verdict
of
merger.
now,
here,
looking
only
to
insulated
conductors
and
forgetting
all
the
rest
of
our
case,
alcoa
had
11.6%
of
the
market,
almost
three
times
the
share
of
brown
and
it
acquired
in
a
horizontal
merger,
a
competitor
with
4.7%
of
the
market
more
than
three
times
the
share
that
kinney
had
had
the
acquisition
in
brown
shoe.
here
is
there,
the
big
company
is
getting
bigger
by
an
acquisition,
which
has
the
chief
justice
said
of
that
in
words
equally
applicable
here,
has
no
countervailing
competitive,
social
or
economic
advantage.
i
can
see
only
two
differences
between
the
brown
shoe
case
and
this
one.
the
shoe
industry
was
fragmented
if
you'd
recall
with
a
multitude
of
small
manufacturers.
in
these
markets,
there's
already
a
concentration
but
surely
that
can't
help
the
appellee.
indeed,
the
court
said
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case
that
if
concentration
is
already
great,
the
importance
of
preventing
even
slight
increases
in
concentration
and
so
preserving
the
possibility
of
eventually
decreasing
the
concentration
is
correspondingly
greater.
it
could
also
be
said
well
in
the
brown
shoe
case,
there
was
a
merger
trend
and
here
perhaps,
there
is
no
merger
trend.
our
answers
are
two.
first,
we
already
have
the
concentration
that
results
from
merger
and
the
effect
of
being
in
motion
toward
that
point
that
was
made
important
at
brown
shoe
can't
be
more
significant
than
being
already
at
the
point
as
this
case
is.
and
the
second
answer
which
is
that
whether
you
call
it
a
merger
trend
or
not,
this
acquisition
was
part
of
a
series
of
acquisitions
in
the
aluminum
conductor
field
and
is
parallel
to
--
by
acquisitions
in
the
copper
field,
which,
of
course,
aren't
before
us.
our
second
reason
for
objecting
to
the
acquisition
of
an
independent
--
no,
our
first
reason
here
for
saying
that
this
is
governed
by
section
7
is
that
the
acquisition
of
an
independent
by
a
vast
integrated
producer
eliminates
the
competition
between
the
two
without
any
compensating
public
advantage.
our
second
equally
important
objection
is
that
it's
the
--
the
successful
independent
fabricator
which
is
the
--
we
think
a
vital
creative
force
and
energizing
creative
force
in
the
industry
and
that
its
disappearance
destroys
something
very
important.
and
there's
no
better
example
of
that
kind
of
company
and
its
importance
to
an
industry
than
rome
cable
was.
it
began
in
the
1930s
with
assets
of
about
$2
million.
it
grew
almost
wholly
by
its
own
expansion
to
a
$24
million
concern
shortly
before
the
acquisition.
it
was
an
aggressive
competitor
though
not
one
that
initiated
price
cuts.
it
had
a
first
rate
sales
organization.
it
was
one
of
the
four
fabricators
equipped
to
roll
its
own
ingot
into
rod
so
that
it
wouldn't
be
dependent
upon
the
competing
integrated
companies
to
buy
rod
from
them
also,
it
wouldn't
have
to
buy
ingot.
but
the
real
way
that
it
made
its
way,
its
name,
its
reputation
was
by
its
research,
technical
skill
and
very
substantial
innovations,
a
year
prior
to
the
merger
that
it
bought
a
--
had
built
a
$675,000
research
facility
carrying
on
this
trend.
i
wish
i
know
how
to
describe
adequately
how
important
the
position,
the
existence
of
those
faculties
of
independent
companies
are
and
how
much
damage
it
seems
to
us
it
will
be
done
if
the
vast
integrated
concerns
were
able
to
buy
up
independent
like
this.
it's
not
merely
that
the
economy
losses
the
advantage
of
having
the
big
firm,
put
forth
its
own
efforts
into
its
own
facilities,
into
developing
its
own
skill.
it's
that
the
independence,
who
today
feel
the
competitive
stimulus,
begin
to
disappear.
there,
the
fellows
who
live
by
their
wits,
not
in
any
invidious
sense,
they
can't
make
money
on
rod,
they
can't
make
money
on
ingot.
they've
got
to
build
the
best
mousetrap
in
the
old
fashion
sense.
and
when
one
of
them
is
superseded,
that
quality
is
very
likely
to
disappear.
that's
one
of
the
intangibles
which
section
7,
as
pointed
out
in
the
brown
shoe
case,
was
intended
to
preserve
for
the
american
economy
and
community.
now,
in
their
brief,
rome
makes
a
number
of
--
not
rome,
alcoa
makes
a
number
of
answers
to
this.
first,
they
say
well,
rome
was
essentially
a
copper
insulator.
it
was
larger
in
copper
than
in
aluminum
but
it
was
a
substantial
factor
in
the
aluminum
field.
it
passes
my
understanding
how
the
elimination
of
a
substantial
factor
in
the
aluminum
field
can
be
made
any
better
by
saying
that
this
company
was
an
independent
fabricator
of
copper
too.
i
don't
know
if
it
makes
him
much
worse
on
this
record,
one
couldn't
say
that
it
does
but
it
certainly
doesn't
make
it
any
better.
appellees
also
argued
below
and
argued
in
their
brief
and
the
district
court
found
that
the
elimination
of
rome
wasn't
very
important
because
there
was
ease
of
access
into
the
aluminum
conductor
market.
the
court
pointed
out
that
whereas
in
1950
that
--
well,
first
point
out
that
alcoa
was
the
only
producer
of
conductor
in
1940
and
that
there
were
12
producers
of
bare
aluminum
conductor
in
1950.
i
add
that
there
are
only
12
today.
the
simple
fact,
of
course,
is
that
1940
was
the
period
in
which
alcoa
was
losing
its
monopoly
in
which
bare
aluminum
conductor
was
taking
over
the
transmission
field
and
after
that,
the
opportunities
to
get
in
apparently
declined,
at
least
the
entries
came
to
a
halt.
the
court
also
said
that
in
1950,
there
were
only
--
there
were
only
four
producers
of
insulated
conductor
and
that
there
were
29
in
1961.
but
i
suggest
that
those
figures
don't
give
an
altogether
accurate
impression.
in
the
first
place,
only
11
of
the
29
could
claim
as
much
as
1%
of
the
aluminum
conductor
field.
second,
there
was
a
tremendous
shift
from
insulated
copper
to
insulated
aluminum
in
the
early
part
of
the
1950s.
you
will
also
recall,
of
course,
the
early
1950s
where
the
period
of
the
korean
war
when
allocations
of
rare
--
of
metals
like
copper
and
aluminum
were
being
made
and
a
considerable
amount
of
aluminum
was
allocated
as
replacement
for
copper.
if
you
look
at
that
stage,
new
firms
searched
into
the
field
but
those
were
temporary
conditions
that
ceased
to
operate.
there's
no
reason
suppose
that
they
will
be
repeated
and
what
happened
was
hardly
evidence
of
ease
of
access
as
it's
shown
by
the
fact
that
since
1955,
only
one
firm
has
entered
the
market
for
aluminum
conductor
and
four,
had
dropped
out
of
the
market
which
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
was
going
--
i
was
going
on
to
stress
that
point,
justice
goldberg.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
an
answer
to
the
argument
that
is
made
about
these
200
people
waiting
in
the
wings.
and
i
was
going
to
suggest
that
while
they
unquestionably
are
there
and
while
technologically
speaking,
there
is
claiming,
no
trouble
and
stopping,
drawing
copper
and
drawing
aluminum
that
commercially
entering
the
aluminum
area
is
what
certainly
be
very
--
one
thing
very
different.
and
i
say
that
for
four
reasons.
one,
you've
already
mentioned
that
alcoa
saw
this
enormous
time,
trouble
and
expenditure
facing
it.
now,
one
can't
claim
that
other
companies
who
are
making
copper
would
all
have
just
the
same
troubles
as
alcoa.
but
i
think
the
very
great
trouble
that
alcoa
foresaw
is
evidence
that
other
companies
would
face
or
shall
i
say,
parallel
and
troubled
by
their
own
particular
difficulty.
and
of
course,
the
reason
among
others
is
certainly
that
what's
technologically
possible
isn't
always
commercially
possible.
i
--
and
what
--
to
consider
shifting
in
any
quantity
from
copper
to
aluminum
would
require
all
kinds
of
difficult
decision.
one
of
them,
just
to
mention
one,
do
you
want
to
give
up
your
established
relationship
with
the
copper
suppliers
and
take
on
the,
perhaps,
doubtful
business
of
being
dependent
for
your
source
of
supply
on
the
integrated
concerns
with
whom
you
will
be
having
to
compete?
being
in
the
wings
isn't
the
same
as
being
on
stage.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
the
conductor
area.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we're
concerned
with
overhead
contractor.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
it
does,
mr.
justice.
the
figures
are
there
on
the
total
poundage
or
footage
and
the
citations
are
in
our
brief
but
one
can
tell
in
terms
of
the
relative
share
of
the
market.
in
1950,
aluminum
had
5%
of
the
insulated
conductor,
in
1955,
had
51%,
in
1959,
it
had
77%
or
78%.
that's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i've
--
it's
not
in
the
record
but
i
think
i
can
say
there
clearly
has
in
the
--
in
many
line,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
aluminum
has
been
forging
ahead.
and
of
course,
if
one
reads
the
record
carefully
here,
there
are
many
suggestions
that
the
alcoa
people
saw
other
more
sophisticated
constructions
of
wire
than
the
insulated
wire
as
an
opportunity
in
the
future.
and
they
picked
up
a
small
magnet
wire
company,
rewire
company
in
order
to
get
into
that
avenue
which
they
hadn't
been
in
before
whereas
here,
of
course,
they
had
been
competitive.
i
think,
i've
already
commented
adequately
on
these
200
concerns
waiting
in
the
wings.
in
the
first
place,
they've
all
stayed
in
the
wings
since
1955.
alcoa's
difficulties
in
entering
the
area
while
--
suggest
that
they
too
would
have
very
great
difficulties.
there's
always
a
drag
on
moving
from
one
area
into
another.
and
finally,
i
suggest
that
speculation
about
what
copper
companies
might
do
to
fill
the
place
of
rome
in
the
aluminum
field
is
simply
not
an
adequate
answer
to
the
demonstrated
increase
in
concentration
and
the
disappearance
of
this
very
important
independent
concern.
now,
that
brings
me
to
our
final
reason
for
arguing
that
this
merger
and
any
other
acquisition
like
it,
violates
section
7.
each
acquisition
by
a
major
integrated
firm
like
alcoa
is
very
likely
to
prove
a
step
in
the
progressive
elimination
of
significant
independent
firms
in
an
industry
resulting
in
each
capture
by
the
giant
integrated
companies
and
a
progression
that
can't
be
stopped
unless
you
stop
the
individual
merger
that
says
violations
of
section
7.
now,
the
facts
here
speak
very
eloquently.
in
february
1957,
kaiser,
which,
of
course,
had
been
coming
up
rapidly
as
you'll
--
and
had
a
large
share
of
its
market,
acquired
the
wire
and
mill
division
of
the
united
states
rubber
company,
that
was
a
division
that
made
insulated
conductors
and
had
a
good
share
although
not
a
great
share
of
the
market.
kaiser
had
sold
18%
of
the
insulated
aluminum
conductor
and
u.s.
rubber,
3.5%.
that
merger
was
one
of
the
factors
which
led
to
alcoa's
acquiring
rome
and
alcoa
officially
wrote
to
one
of
his
colleagues.
kaiser's
purchase
of
u.s.
rubber's
wire
and
cable
division
only
accentuates
our
position
and
will
in
the
future,
i
believe,
places
in
severe
jeopardy
of
a
proper
share
of
the
aluminum
conductor
market.
in
may
1957,
olin
mathieson,
which
through
our
may
is
an
integrated
aluminum
company,
bought
southern
electrical
which
made
8%
of
the
sales
of
aluminum
conductor.
olin
wasn't
previously
in
the
field
but
this
again
is
part
of
the
trend
of
the
giant
fabricated
--
giant
integrated
company
to
acquire
fabricators
as
outlets.
and
another
alcoa
executive,
commenting
on
the
proposed
measure
--
merger
with
rome
said
that
kaiser-u.s.
rubber
deal
and
the
olin
mathieson-southern
electrical
combination
seemed
to
be
the
most
industry
racking
announcements
and
certainly
the
most
threatening
to
alcoa's
position.
rome
cable
is
by
far
the
best
acquisition,
in
my
opinion,
that
alcoa
could
hope
to
find.
the
step
would
be
the
answer
to
the
present
kaiser
threat
to
push
alcoa
out
of
first
place
in
the
electrical
conductor
field,
then
alcoa
acquired
rome
nor
was
that
the
end
of
it.
as
soon
as
alcoa
acquired
rome,
reynolds
metals
began
to
get
worried.
and
in
a
discussion
that
their
executives
had
shortly
later
in
january
1959,
on
the
minutes
reigned,
since
alcoa's
acquisition
of
rome
cable
company
last
week,
now
lives
reynolds
as
the
only
major
aluminum
or
copper
company
without
insulating
facilities,
it's
expected
that
our
sale
of
metal
with
electrical
applications
will
suffer,
if
some
action
is
not
taken
to
enlarge
our
wire
and
cable
product
line.
reynolds
apparently
didn't
have
the
money
at
that
time
to
buy
someone
as
the
notes
show.
but
in
may
1961,
reynolds
bought
the
wire
and
cable
facilities
of
roebling,
which
had
been
a
company
with
an
excellent
reputation
in
this
field.
and
after
the
record
closed
in
this
case,
aluminum
of
canada
acquired
an
insulating
company.
so,
as
i
suggest
that
one
of
these
steps
does
in
fact
lead
to
another.
that
as
the
chief
justice
said
in
brown
shoe,
congress
saw
the
process
of
concentration
as
a
dynamic
force
then
it
sought
to
assure
that
the
courts
and
the
federal
trade
commission
would
have
power
to
break
the
force
at
the
outset
and
before
it
gathered
momentum
and
we
brought
suits
attacking
the
kaiser
merger
as
well
as
this
one.
it
seems
to
me
that
unless
one
loses
sight
of
the
thrust
of
section
7
in
a
mess
of
technical
wrangling
over
the
definition
of
the
market
ease
of
access
and
other
tools
that
ought
to
be
kept
serving
to
the
main
purpose,
surely,
these
cases,
the
kaiser
one,
this
one
that
i've
mentioned,
are
typical
instances
of
the
mergers
prohibited
by
section
7.
what
congress
was
worried
about
was
that
the
large
concerns
with
these
series
of
acquisitions,
as
i
said
at
the
beginning,
about
which
there
can
be
quite
a
lot
of
argument
perhaps
in
the
individual
instance
as
here
about
ease
of
access
and
the
like,
other
added
competitive
effects
would
not
be
enough
to
make
out
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
and
that
it
passed
this
law
to
prevent
that
kind
of
accelerated
concentration
of
economic
power,
not
only
on
economic
grounds
but
also
because
of
the
threat
to
other
values
in
a
trend
toward
concentration.
this
acquisition,
we
submit,
of
a
significant
independent
by
a
vast
integrated
company,
without
any
offsetting
on
social,
economic
or
competitive
values,
violates
the
very
core
of
the
policy
embodied
in
section
7.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
don't
think
that
we
accept
the
meaning
of
competition
as
the
district
judge
used
it.
i
would
call
this
one
of
the
conclusions
or
characterizations
that
one
must
look
behind.
i
agree
that
there
are
some
companies
consolidated
edison
of
new
york
is
one,
which
are
in
a
position
where
for
them,
the
cost
advantage
may
for
the
present
be
with
copper
because
they
have
a
great
many
connections
to
beg
to
existing
copper
lines
and
the
connections
are
short.
so
that
the
connection
is
--
preponderates
over
the
distance
and
of
course
that
would
affect
cost
of
it.
but
for
the
great
bulk
of
it,
we
say
that
the
very
fact
that
aluminum
has
been
displacing
copper
5%,
50%,
77%,
together
with
the
cost
differential
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
agreed
--
of
course,
i
have
to
agree
that
they
used
for
both
cover.
and
i'm
talking
about
cover.
my
figures
were
based
on
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
now,
they
--
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
of
course,
we're
concerned
only
with
the
sales
for
new
installations.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
the
--
that
the
weight
makes
any
difference.
the
difficult
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
yes,
and
the
--
on
the
bare
conductor,
aluminum
now
has
served
94%
or
95%.
that's
because
not
only
of
the
great
difference
in
cost
where
you
have
only
the
metal
and
not
the
cost
of
the
insulator
to
consider,
it's
also
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
don't
think
it's
really
the
more
insulation,
but
i
think
it's
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
that
would
be
true.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it's
very
little
in
overhead
wire.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
--
i
--
i
don't
think
that
the
overhead
wires,
significant
amount
of
it,
reached
the
point
of
weight
where
the
factor,
your
honor,
calls
attention
to
the
matters.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
connecting
problem
makes
the
difference.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
are
places
where
the
cost
is
about
the
same,
as
i
said
with
consolidated
edison.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
that's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
have
any
broken
down
figures
on
the
east
coast
except
to
what
i've
said
about
consolidated
edison
but
even
the
consolidated
edison
people
recognized
that
once
this
new
device
had
come
out
for
drop
cable,
that
then
the
cost
advantage
of
the
aluminum
were
such
that
all
their
new
installations
of
drop
cable
are
going
to
be
aluminum.
