justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
suppose
(inaudible)
either
i
think
it
--
what
we're
talking
about
here
in
material
is
not
embraced
by
the
proviso
at
page
55.
i
don't
really
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
the
fact
--
the
question
of
constitutional
immunity
is
now
before
us
to
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
what
happens
if
he
would
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
affirmed
that.
we
didn't
dismiss.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i
know
the
district
court
held
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
rice,
do
you
go
this
far
--
certainly
carbide
has
a
contract
at
least
to
perform
services
whether
it
performs
in
its
contract
(inaudible)
or
anything
else.
it's
been
hired
to
perform
services
for
the
unites
states
government.
now,
does
your
position
that
is
a
constitutionally
sufficient
basis
of
tennessee,
the
tax,
the
privilege
of
preforming
those
services
irrespective
whether
or
not
they're
preformed
under
the
supervision
of
representatives
with
the
unites
states
on
this
--
on
the
site.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you'd
go
that
far?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
why
are
you
arguing
that
the
chance
of
what's
the
relationship
between
the
employees
of
carbide
--
and
carbide?
is
that
material
to
your
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
thought
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
as
i
understand
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
i'm
trying
to
say
is
(inaudible)
a
million,
two
hundred
thousand
a
year
or
something
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
as
usual,
my
(inaudible).
that's
--
that's
close
to
2,750,000
a
year
and
i
gather
your
position
is
that
tennessee
constitutionally
may
had
taxed
privilege
of
preforming
for
that
fee
or
any
fee
services
for
the
united
states
government
or
anybody
else.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then
you
do
the
--
and
then
i'm
lost.
i
must
say
i
thought
that
your
whole
position
was
that
you
measure
the
facts
on
the
privilege
of
performing
these
services
the
way
you
do
which
relates
to
(inaudible,
but
you
are
taxing
them
on
those
with
things,
is
it,
directly,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
measured
--
you
measure
the
tax
by
the
value
of
that
property
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
but
the
tax
is
on
the
privilege
of
preforming
the
services.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
using
the
property
then.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
