probably
sub-contractors
actually

it
kind

and
that's

who

who
supplied
the

i
don't
understand
why
it
would
be
discriminatory.
as
i
understand
the
tennessee
statute,
it
would
apply,
probably,
privilege
of
rendering
services
to
a

the
private
owner
of

of
the
materials
from
which
building
were
going

he'd
hire

put
the
materials
together
and

and

for
you

how

justice

right.
justice

but
that's
not
what's

here.

justice

hopefully,
a

a
use
tax
is
general
imposed
on
the
buyer,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
not
the
seller.
justice

but
generally,
it's
on
a
state
purchase
and
they
used
it
within

and
the

isn't
collectable
that

justice

do
you
know
of
any
other
state
that

this?
is
this
fairly
common

is
it
quite
rare?

after

under

mistaken
in
