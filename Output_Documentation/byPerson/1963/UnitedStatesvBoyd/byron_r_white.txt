justice

white
mr.
solicitor,
this
is
a
--
this
is
just
a
one
shot
tax,
i
take
it
on
--
it's
only
taxed
once
on
the
property
that's
acquired.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
a
--
it's
not
an
annual
tax
on
the
property
it
would
seem
that
(voice

do
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
oh,
i
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
tax
that's
collected
here,
the
$10,000,000
is
just
one
tax
on
new
property
acquired.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be
true
to
the
church
prior
to
construction.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
never
mind
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
three
categories
what
you
concede
that
--
make
immunities.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
makes
three.
how
about
the
fourth?
how
about
the
taxes
on
government
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
--
this
is
the
fourth
category.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
i
have
a
--
if
i'm
into
the
state
where
there's
no
sales
tax
and
i
moved
to
your
state,
bring
my
automobile,
all
my
household
furniture,
everything
i
owed
and
it's
all
five
years
old
and
i
move
their,
i
get
taxed
for
used
property
in
your
state
once.
justice
byron
r.
white
everybody.
justice
byron
r.
white
everybody
--
doesn't
it
make
any
difference
--
can
you
get
credit
from
car
sales
and
used
tax
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that
doesn't
say
that
the
counts
of
legislation
that
takes
the
way
this
kind
of
a
time
of
the
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
but
all
--
all
they
intend
to
do
is
reduce
immunity
to
constitutional
limit.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
they
intended
--
they
didn't
intend
--
they
didn't
intend
to
revoke
the
constitutional
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
one
there
in
the
legislative
history
is
of
just
the
facts
like
this
is
not
within
what
congress
thought
with
the
constitutional
immunity
of
the
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
hear
anything
like
that
in
his
opinion
that
--
that
this
kind
of
attack
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
case
is
outside
the
constitutional
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that's
all
they
wanted
to
do
is
to
get
the
--
in
carson
they
stopped.
they
stopped
that
looking
at
9
(b).
they
didn't
get
the
constitutional
immunity
but
it
maybe
considerate.
you
don't
know
what's
the
outcome
of
that
case
could
have
been
if
it
hasn't
gotten
in
the
constitutional
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
nothing
in
the
opinion
in
that
case
rather
than
the
fact
that
9
(b)
is
addressed
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
so
they
had
to
get
--
doesn't
--
did
they
consider
what
the
constitution
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
the
congress
came
along
and
said,
"well,
let's
get
rid
of
the
statutory
that's
used
for
--
for
exempting
the
--
even
state
taxation.
let's
just
get
rid
of
it
and
reduce
it
to
a
constitutional
question,"
and
there
is
no
suggestion
that
(inaudible)
--
how
congress
thought
a
case
like
this
ought
to
be
prepared.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
they
wanted
to
get
rid
of
the
statutory
if
--
if
the
statute
was
a
part
--
if
the
statute
was
a
part
in
taxing
this
kind
of
--
this
--
if
they
want
to
get
rid
of
it.and
one
thing
that
they
could
do
to
get
rid
of
the
constitutional
immunity
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
they
--
they
might
have
been
--
they
might
have
been
in
that
opinion
but
the
--
but
the
--
the
finding
in
the
legislative
history
if
congress
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
maybe
so,
that
maybe
so.
it
might
even
--
not
even
been
passed
after
the
tennessee
case.
it
maybe
that
the
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
can
state
--
wasn't
this
--
livingston
draw
on
the
constitution
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
district

--
the
district
court
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
constitutional
basis
of
the
use
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
the
use
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
court
--
but
the
district
court
didn't
go
on
that
basis.
district
court
said
even
if
this
is
what
--
even
if
--
even
if
this
was
actuated
by
profitability
who
just
--
for
the
financial
benefit
of
du
pont
nevertheless,
there
was
immunity
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

there
was
an
affirmance.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
(inaudible)
for
a
year
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
for
carbide
for
their
benefits
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
agree
that
they
could
have
put
a
use
--
either
a
use
or
sales
tax,
your
characteristic
kind
of
it
(inaudible)
but
you
could
not
like
impose
a
sales
tax
on
purposes
like
carbide
but
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
term?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
and
no
--
and
not
in
the
characteristic
each
had.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
why
do
you
only
told
it
once?
if
--
if
i
--
a
piece
of
machinery
from
outside
the
state
to
bring
it
in,
you
couldn't
--
either
the
sales
in
the
ordinary
use
tax
on
it,
would
you
say
i
want
to
tax
it
for
the
privilege
of
using
it,
the
privilege
of
using
it,
the
contract.
now
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
that
make
really
a
tax
out
of
your
argument
of
what
the
tax
really
is?
it's
not
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
using
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
do
--
you
do
say
that
this
isn't
like
the
conventional
use
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
do
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
think
that
has
been
a
conventional
use
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
kern
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
kern
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right,
that's
right.
but
what
are
you
taxing
with
that
here
when
you
tax
it
only
once?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
he
doesn't
tax
here
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
you're
obliged
but
--
but
your
--
your
time
has
expired,
what
kind
of
a
tax
you've
got?
and
you
say
it
for
the
privilege
of
using.
i
thought
for
the
privilege
of
using,
what?
for
a
year
in
tennessee
or
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
undoubtedly
is.
you
have
to
--
i
think
your
own
court
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
or
to
use
of
it,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
does
cover
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
agency
and
contractor
are
inconsistent?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
are
--
i
thought
--
i
thought
your
own
court
held
they
were
agents?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
alright,
they're
agents
so
we
don't
need
to
argue
about
agency
or
contractors.
contractors
are
agents
for
all
sorts
of
purposes.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
there
that
the
agent
here
for
that
kind
of
a
purpose
we're
talking
about,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
they
said
just
the
reverse
that
it
was
not
material.
they
didn't
care
whether
their
position
was
--
whether
or
not
that
was
agency
or
contractor
or
servant.
i
thought
it
was
in
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
isn't
what
you
tax,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
you
don't
comport
to
be
taxed
(inaudible)
the
privilege
of
performing
services.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
using
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
sales
and
use.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
your
court
as
--
itself
has
--
your
state
court
has
set
aside
any
possibility
of
applying
king
&
boozer
to
this
case,
it
said
that
kern
applies
instead
since
this
was
(inaudible)
in
behalf
of
the
government
to
the
purchasing
agency
here,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
i'm
saying
is
that
king
&
boozer
doesn't
cover
this
case
and
kern
you
say
doesn't
cover
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
neither
one
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
told
yesterday
that
this
wasn't
the
--
you
weren't
applying
your
ordinary
use
tax
to
this
case.
and
it's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
that's
curry.
alright,
that's
curry,
ordinary
use
tax
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
is
curry.
but
you
tell
me
that
you
--
you
had
to
amend
your
statute
here.
had
to
amend
your
statute
and
that
create
a
special
type
of
use
tax
to
cover
the
situation?
what's
--
what's
--
then
so
curry
isn't
relevant
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
(voice
overlap)
--
right,
so
you
say
it
is
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
your
court
--
well,
you
were
certain
to
suggest
in
your
court
below
wasn't
sound?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
said
the
ordinary
use
tax
could
not
be
applied
to
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
constitutionally
it
couldn't
be
applied
to
be
held.
but
that
this
was
not
your
--
this
kind
of
attack.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
use
tax?
under
kern,
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
know,
and
a
--
and
a
horse
--
and
a
horse
of
the
--
of
a
color
that
curry
wasn't
dealing
with
either?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
--
all
of
this
amount
which
it
earns
in
tennessee
is
going
to
be
returned
to
tennessee,
isn't
it,
in
its
income
tax,
in
its
franchise
tax
or
the
excise
tax
measured
by
net
income?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
a
--
the
states
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
well,
the
state
still
tax
the
income
of
the
government
employees
but
they
--
i
mean,
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
measured
by?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
fact
that
as
they
are
now
paying
an
excise
tax
on
this
income
(inaudible)
oak
ridge.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
if
it
--
which
the
--
might
not
be
able
to
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
indication
they
intended
to
do
anything
other
than
put
all
agencies
on
the
same
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
may
or
may
not
have
--
that
they
may
or
may
not
have
thought
that
they
were
--
that
they
were
allowing
this
particular
kind
of
pacts
in
that
--
in
that
respect.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
it
was
the
statute
rather
than
the
constitution
which
bars
the
tax
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
then
he
probably
thought
(inaudible)
