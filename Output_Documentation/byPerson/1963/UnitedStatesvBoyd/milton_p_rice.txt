mr.
milton
p.
rice
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
it's
well-established,
i
take
it
that
it
is
that
a
state
tax
is
not
invalid
purely
because
the
economic
burden
of
that
tax
can
be
shown
to
fall
upon
the
federal
government.
it
seems
to
me
that
principle
has
been
to
our
established
refute
at
this
late
date.
in
the
dravo
case,
the
case
of
alabama
versus
king
&
boozer,
the
esso
standard
oil
company
against
evans
case
and
in
the
michigan
property
tax
cases
to
which
allusion
has
been
made.
i've
been
a
little
puzzled
by
the
absence
of
any
reference
to
the
second
and
third
of
those
cases
that
i
mentioned,
namely
the
king
&
boozer
case
and
the
esso
standard
case
because
it
seems
to
me
that
they
control
the
situation
presented
by
this
case
to
an
even
greater
extent
than
do
the
michigan
property
tax
cases,
although
we
think
that
they
are
wholly
consistent
in
principle.
in
both
the
king
&
boozer
case
and
the
esso
standard
case,
i
would
emphasize
that
title
to
the
property
in
question
was
solely
and
exclusively
in
the
united
states
government.
the
contractor
had
no
ultimate
beneficial
use
of
that
property
whatever.
the
only
use
he
had
was
during
the
time
that
he
was
handling
that
property
and
fashioning
things
out
of
it
for
the
sole
and
exclusive
benefit
of
the
government.
he
was
paid
a
fee
in
those
cases
in
the
king
&
boozer
case
that
was
a
cost-plus-fixed-fee
contract
just
like
this
one
is.
in
the
esso
standard
case
that
was
a
fee
based
on
the
amount
of
gallon
each
handle.
but
in
neither
instance,
it
should
be
emphasized
and
it
can't
be
emphasize
too
strongly.
the
contractor
didn't
have
any
personal
interest
whatever
in
that
property.
all
of
it
were
downed
to
the
ultimate
benefit
of
the
government
and
the
contractor
got
through
with
it,
he
was
through
with
it.
his
interest
though
was
consistent
all
the
way
throughout.
he
had
interest
in
that
property
so
long
as
he
was
using
it
because
that
was
his
business.
it
was
esso's
business
to
handle
and
store
this
gasoline
for
the
government.
it
was
king
&
boozer's
business
to
build
an
army
camp
for
the
government.
now,
i
think
it's
further
well-established
that
a
state
tax
burdening
the
government
will
be
stricken
down
as
invalid
only
in
three
instances.
one,
if
it
is
imposed
directly
upon
the
government,
such
a
thing
is
almost
unthinkable
has
been
since
m'culloch
against
maryland
anyway.
and
certainly
that's
not
what's
happened
in
this
case.
this
tax
is
not
imposed
upon
the
federal
government.
it's
imposed
on
a
private
party.
secondly,
this
court
has
stricken
down
taxes
which
do
not
impose
directly
upon
the
government
itself
were
imposed
upon
one
whose
relationship
to
the
government
were
so
close
as
to
make
it
an
agency
relationship.
in
other
words,
if
you
can't
tax
the
government,
you
can't
tax
the
government's
agent
either.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
concept.
thirdly,
taxes
will
be
stricken
down
if
they
burden
the
government,
if
they
discriminate
against
the
government
or
those
with
whom
it
deals.
we
most
honestly
submit
that
these
taxes
are
not
in
any
sense
discriminatory.
they
have
not
been
applied
in
a
discriminatory
manner.
well,
this
is
not
a
reported
case,
i
can
tell
the
court
that
upon
the
authority
of
this
case,
as
before
us
today
in
the
tennessee
supreme
court's
opinion
in
it,
a
tax
was
sustained
as
against
a
contractor
with
a
local
government
in
tennessee
where
the
local
government
had
bought
the
materials
used
and
turn
them
over
to
the
contractor
but
the
contractor
had
no
interest
whatsoever
in
the
materials
that
he
used.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
we
have
made
an
exception
in
the
case
of
church
construction,
if
your
honor
please,
and
that
is
the
only
exception.
and
in
that
connection,
i
would
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
illinois
case
of
owen
madison.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir,
i
do.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
you
have
to
know
in
madison
against
illinois
if
the
three-judge
federal
court
opinion
and
this
court
dismissed
it
summarily.
now,
the
three-judge
opinion
held
that
that
did
not
work
discrimination.
the
fact
that
illinois
had
made
an
exception
in
the
case
of
charities,
of
course,
this
is
confined
strictly
to
the
churches,
not
just
to
owen
charities.
the
property
has
got
to
be
for
church
construction
and
otherwise
the
use
tax
has
to
be
paid
upon
it.
now,
i
can't
emphasize
too
strongly
here.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
if
the
tax
is
on
government
property
itself,
i
think
that
u.s.
against
allegheny
county
undoubtedly
would
control.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
we're
talking
about
an
ad
valorem
property
tax
there.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir.
this
is
a
privilege
tax
case,
however,
and
i
eliminated
that
category
for
this
reason,
this
is
not
an
ad
valorem
tax
but
a
privilege
tax
as
well
as
the
case
in
king
&
boozer
and
esso
standard.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
you
mean
if
the
contractee
or
owner
where
general
electric
rather
than
the
atomic
energy
commission.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir,
he
would
if
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
--
the
taxed
are
not
been
theretofore
been
paid
on
it
on
the
acquisition
of
purchase.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
assuming
that
the
property
have
been
acquired
under
some
circumstances
whereby
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
--
not
necessary.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
the
instance
of
the
tax,
if
your
honor
please,
would
be
on
the
contractor.
now,
that's
--
that's
the
case
invariably.
now,
of
course,
if
--
so
we
have,
really,
in
tennessee,
this
is
a
little
bit
peculiar,
we
have
the
normal
retail
sales
tax.
we
have
also
the
conventional
complimentary
use
tax.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
and
we
have
added
this
third
category
now
in
which
we
tax
use
per
se
but
we
give
credit
of
course
during
the
sales
tax
previously
paid
with
respect
to
the
same
property.
oh,
i'll
say
this,
had
general
electric
acquired
the
property
under
some
circumstances
whereby
it
had
not
born
sales
tax
and
then
brought
it
into
tennessee
and
turned
it
over
to
carbide
here
or
ferguson.
the
taxable
incident
would
be
carbide
or
ferguson's
use
of
it
just
as
it
is
in
this
case.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir.
one
time
only.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir,
we
have
a
reciprocal
provision
in
our
statute.
we
give
that
credit
to
states
to
give
it
to
us.
but
in
general,
that's
--
that's
the
correct
statement.
i
mean
everybody
is
subject
to
tax
once
with
the
provision
for
credit
for
any
previous
taxes
paid
either
to
tennessee
or
to
some
other
state.
now,
this
tennessee
statute
--
there's
two
places
that
make
it
abundantly
clear
the
nature
of
this
tax.
section
67-3003
tennessee
code
annotated
provides
that
every
person
is
exercising
a
taxable
privilege
who
uses
or
consumes
tangible
personal
property
irrespective
of
the
ownership
of
that
property
or
any
tax
immunity
which
the
owner
of
that
property
might
enjoy.
these
taxes,
the
ones
that
have
been
imposed
here,
i
would
emphasize,
are
not
upon
procurement.
they
are
not
upon
procurement
at
all.
now,
that
question
is
out
of
the
way
incidentally
because
the
tennessee
supreme
court
resolved
that
in
favor
of
these
appellants.
the
chancery
court
of
davidson
county,
which
was
the
trial
court,
held
liability
under
the
statute
as
a
whole.
when
the
case
was
appealed
to
the
tennessee
supreme
court,
the
--
that
judgment
was
modified
to
the
extent
that
it
was
held
that
these
contractors,
insofar
of
their
procurement
activities
were
concerned,
were
agents
of
the
government
for
the
purpose
of
procurement
only
and
that
the
kern-limerick
case
controlled.
they
held
however
that
in
the
general
performance
of
their
contractual
duties,
they
were
contractors
and
not
agents
of
aec.
therefore,
the
contractors'
use
tax,
and
we
have
another
provision
here
which
i
shall
read,
that's
the
following
section
of
the
code,
it
provides
that
where
a
contractor
uses
his
tangible
personal
property
in
the
performance
of
his
contract
or
to
fulfill
contract
obligations,
the
tax
shall
be
paid
unless
it
is
previously
been
paid.
now,
insofar
as
the
government
is
concerned,
we
have
two
sections
of
our
sales
tax
statute
that
exempt
the
government.
section
67-3012
exempts
the
state
and
local
governments
any
sale
to
the
state
of
tennessee
directly
or
to
a
political
subdivision
of
the
state
of
tennessee
made
directly
is
exempt
from
the
tax.
we
have
accorded
the
federal
government
the
same
advantage.
in
67-3004
we
specifically
provide
that
direct
sales
to
the
federal
government
or
to
any
agency
of
the
federal
government
created
by
congress
are
exempt
from
the
tennessee
sales
and
use
tax.
we've
gone
further
than
that
and
make
them
take
some
special
recognition
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
and
that
we
have
exempted
specifically
broad
categories
of
materials
which
are
used
there,
atomic
weapons,
atomic
weapons
parts
and
special
nuclear
materials,
source
materials
and
several
other
categories.
we
have
pointed
them
out
specifically
for
exemption.
so
i
would
certainly
urge
in
all
sincerity
that
there
isn't
any
purpose
or
intent
whatsoever
in
the
tennessee
sales
and
use
tax
statute
to
discriminate
against
the
atomic
energy
commission.
we
consider
them
to
be
a
valuable
addition
to
our
state.
and
we
certainly
do
not
discriminate
against
them
and
don't
want
to.
i
think
our
statute
makes
that
clear.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
no
question
about
it.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir.
it
has
in
one
case
that
ended
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
this
was
a
contract,
if
your
honor
please,
with
the
town
of
millington
which
is
a
small
place
in
shelby
county
near
memphis.
they
engaged
the
contractor
to
lay
some
sewer
pipe
for
them.
they
bought
the
sewer
pipe
themselves
thinking
they're
going
to
save
the
sales
tax,
turned
it
over
to
the
contractor.
when
the
tax
them
on
it,
they
brought
a
suit.
and
it
was
tried
before
the
same
trial
judge
who
decided
this
cause
and
he
had
just
decided
it
about
only
a
month
or
so
forth.
and
on
the
strength
of
the
holding
that
he
made
in
this
case,
he
did
what
he
had
to
do
there.he
sustained
the
tax.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
sales
or
use
tax
on
the
use
of
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
it's
the
same
tax,
the
contractor
use
tax
on
the
materials.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
the
city
had
gone
and
acquired
the
--
the
sewer
pipe
and
other
materials
directly.
of
course,
there
was
no
tax
collected
by
the
vendor
and
non-paid
for
the
city,
then
the
city
turned
it
over
to
these
private
contractor
to
use
in
fulfilling
its
contract
with
the
city
of
millington.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
no,
sir,
it's
a
sale
or
use
tax.
it's
the
same
one
we
have
here.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir.
no
question
it's
a
privilege
tax.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
measured
by
the
cost
price
or
fair
market
value
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
--
whichever
is
greater.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
those
decisions,
if
your
honor
please,
antedate
the
enactment
of
this
statue
we've
been
talking
about.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
they
establish
the
proposition
that
under
the
tennessee
construction,
the
contractor
is
the
user
or
consumer
and
not
a
reseller.
and
when
i
say
both
of
them
antedate,
one
of
them
does
not,
the
s.
m.
lawrence
case.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
that's
a
--
a
more
recent
case
and
it
does
involve
the
application
of
--
of
this
section
we're
talking
about.
now,
that
was
a
case
of
a
purchase
of
some
air
conditioning
equipment
by
the
city
of
jackson
and
some
of
its
agencies.
and
the
tax
was
sustained
there
also.
but
most
important
in
this
case,
i
think
this
court
is
aware
that
this
is
actually
the
second
round
of
this
controversy.
the
first
one
culminated
in
this
court's
decision
in
roane-anderson
against
carson
where
the
question
before
the
court
at
that
time
was
the
effect
of
what
was
formerly
the
last
sentence
of
section
9
(b)
of
the
atomic
energy
act,
whether
that
language
served
to
exempt
carbide
and
certain
other
contractors
who
were
involved
in
that
suit
from
the
tennessee
sales
taxes.
this
court
held,
construing
that
section
that
exempted
the
property,
activities
and
income
of
the
commission,
construed
it
to
include
the
activities
carried
on
by
the
contractors.
that
was
in
1952.
now,
what
happened
thereafter?
in
1953,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
amended
the
atomic
energy
act
in
one
particular
own
and
that
is
to
strike
that
last
sentence
from
section
9
(b).
why
was
that
done?
well,
the
committee
reports
are
revealing
as
to
the
purpose
and
intention
of
that
action.
s.
rep.
no.
694
and
i
believe
that
i
have
excerpts
from
it
on
page
23
of
my
brief,
contains
this
statement,
"thus,
the
atomic
energy
commission's
contractors,
by
reason
of
the
statutory
exemption
as
interpreted
by
the
supreme
court,
are
entitled
to
an
exemption
from
taxation
which
is
not
enjoyed
by
comparably
situated
contractors
of
other
agencies
and
departments."
that
was
the
conclusion
of
the
senate
committee
after
studying
the
section
9
(b)
in
this
court's
decision
construing
it.
among
other
things
found
in
this
senate
report,
is
a
letter
from
the
atomic
energy
commission
with
respect
to
the
proposed
repealing
legislation.
this
letter
was
addressed
to
the
honorable
sterling
cole,
who's
the
chairman
of
the
joint
committee
on
atomic
energy.
it
was
written
by
the
then
chairman
of
the
atomic
energy
commission,
mr.
lewis
strauss.
and
here's
what
mr.
strauss
said,
“reducing
the
commission's
exemption
from
state
and
local
taxes
to
the
constitutional
immunity
generally
applicable
would
result
in
an
increase
of
several
million
dollars
annually
in
the
cost
of
the
atomic
energy
program
in
the
form
of
added
state
and
local
taxes
born
by
the
federal
government.”
there,
if
the
court
please,
we
have
a
statement
by
the
atomic
energy
commission
itself,
"congress,
if
you
passed
this
legislation,
you
are
going
to
cost
us
several
million
dollars
a
year."
mr.
milton
p.
rice
if
your
honor
please,
if
they
were
entitled
to
the
doctrine
of
implied
constitutional
immunity,
it
wouldn't
cause
them
anything.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
but
reducing
it
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
no,
sir.
i
would
suggest
they
did.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
i
don't
think
we
can
disregard
mr.
strauss'
opinion,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
repeal
is
going
to
cause
the
atomic
energy
commission
served
a
million
of
dollars.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
if
your
honor
please,
the
carson
against
roane-anderson
which
prompted
this
thing
was
a
sales
or
use
tax
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
--
case.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
perhaps
so,
if
your
honor
please,
but
the
tennessee
supreme
court
--
it
held
--
it
agreed
with
this
court
to
section
9
(b)
example
but
it
did
also
held
on
a
very
exhausted
opinion
that
they
were
independent
contractors.
now,
when
the
case
came
up
here,
there
was
no
assignment
of
error
made
by
the
other
side
on
that
store.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir,
it's
statutory
entirely.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
oh,
it
was
--
it
was
free
the
minute
entirely.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
it
does
involve
sales
or
use
taxes,
if
your
honor
please,
just
as
the
first
case
did.
and
there
were
numerous
states
who
were
interested
in
--
at
that
time
by
reason
of
their
sales
and
use
taxes.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
i
would
certainly
infer
that
the
states
who
sponsored
this
were
of
the
opinion
that
they
could
prevail
on
the
matter
of
implied
constitutional
immunity
if
you
just
get
rid
of
the
statutory
exemption.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
no,
sir,
i
can't
say
they
said
so
in
so
many
words
in
there.
but
i
can
escape
the
significance
of
mr.
strauss'
statement
that
is
going
to
cost
us
a
vast
sum
of
money,
if
you
repeal
the
statutory
exemption.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
perhaps
so,
we
can
only
guess
about
that.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir,
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
i
don't
think,
however,
if
your
honor
please,
that
we
can
lose
sight
of
the
history
of
--
of
this
thing.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir,
it
did.
this
court
did
not
deliver
an
opinion
in
livingston
though,
it
simply
affirmed
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
--
per
curiam.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
the
three-judge
district
court
did
deliver
an
opinion
by
divided
court
and
this
court
affirmed
per
curiam.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
but
now,
i'm
coming
to
that.
i
don't
--
don't
want
to
overlook
that
point
at
all.livingston
is
a
different
situation
from
this
in
two
very
important
respects.
the
most
important
is
that
brought
the
tax
that
was
imposed
on
du
pont
in
livingston
was
the
normal
retailer
sales
tax.
there
was
no
tax
on
use
per
se
like
we
have
here.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
there
was
a
complimentary
--
conventional
complimentary
use
tax
but
there
was
no
tax
on
use
per
se
by
a
contractor.
so,
that
is
an
important
difference.
i
--
second
and
more
compelling
difference,
in
my
mind
even,
is
the
fact
that
du
pont's
undertaking
in
livingston
was
just
a
free
gratis
proposition.
they
were
paid
$1.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
there
was
an
affirmance
which
i
assumed
indicates
the
concurrence
with
the
result.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
no,
sir,
i
think
it's
--
its
normal
--
normal
statement
that
per
curiam
affirmance
would
not
indicate
a
complete
endorsement
of
the
reasoning
necessarily.
we
think
this
case
is
different
in
any
event.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir.
that's
made
abundantly
clear
in
the
statement
of
facts
there.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
that's
possible
i
assume.
what
they
got
was
$1
for
eight
years.
now,
what
carbide
is
getting
here
for
one
essence
is
the
quarter
of
million
dollars
a
month.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir.
the
only
benefits
that
could
possibly
have
gotten
out
of
is
a
very
indirect
and
intangible
benefits.
in
fact,
the
record
stated
in
there
that
du
pont
had
undertaken
the
assignment
rather
reluctantly
and
over
the
objection
or
some
of
its
shareholders
and
directors
and
had
been
impelled
by
patriotic
motives
only.
now,
in
this
case,
we
--
it's
--
it's
vastly
different.
carbide
has
the
same
motive
in
this
case
that
any
contractor
has.
it's
a
profit
motive
and
i
don't
sanction
them
for
it.
certainly,
nobody
can
be
expected
to
work
for
nothing
but
there
is
a
--
a
vast
difference
between
a
contractor
making
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
a
month,
$2,750,000
a
year
on
a
capital
investment
of
nothing.
and
there
are
not
many
contractors
i
know
of
that
are
doing
that
well,
cost-plus,
cost-plus-fixed-fee,
lump
sum,
time
and
material
to
what
have
you.
there's
a
lot
of
them
whose
loss
money.
the
car
--
carbide
has
got
a
guaranteed
return
which
compares
very
favorably
with
the
compensation
derived
by
anyone
doing
that
sort
of
work.
ferguson's
fee
is
not
set,
it's
the
renegotiated
periodically
and
it's
geared
to
the
amount
of
work
done.
i
think
their
fee
during
the
period,
we're
concerned
with
here,
was
$20,000
or
a
--
something
like
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollar
contract.
but
i
don't
think
that
we
can
contend
for
a
moment
that
there
isn't
any
relationship
between
the
compensation
received
and
the
property
which
they
actually
are
using.
now,
what
is
used
anyhow?
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
it
makes
no
difference
as
far
as
there
is
any
profit
--
profit
coming
from
it
or
not.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir.
they
may
be
incurring
a
loss
with
it.
that
won't
affect
their
liability
for
a
use
tax
with
respect
to
it.
now,
we
define
"use"
in
our
statute
and
i
think
it's
rather
conventional
definition
as
the
exercise
of
any
power
or
dominion
over
that
property
which
the
owner
could
exercise
because
certainly,
taking
it
and
putting
it
together
and
reshaping
it
and
evolving
something
new
is
a
use
of
the
--
if
the
owner
could
put
the
property
to
it.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
i
don't
think
that
it
does,
if
your
honor
please.
profit
you
said,
didn't
you?
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
i
think
the
absence
of
profit
certainly
would
come
to
the
negative
any
suggestion
that
--
that
the
contractor
was
--
was
getting
any
use
out
of
it
at
all.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir,
i
suppose
it
--
it
could
be
put
that
way.
not
--
not
--
even
the
government
activities,
certainly,
the
government's
interest
in
it
would
have
to
be
conceded.
it
is
so
exclusively
a
government
activity
though
that
is
beyond
the
pail
of
taxation
by
a
concurrent
survey.
this
is
undoubtedly
government
business.
now,
we
are
not
denying
that
for
a
moment
and
never
have
but
we
insist
also
that
it's
carbide's
and
ferguson's
business,
business
that
they're
--
they're
being
paid
for
just
like
any
other
contractor
is.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
the
ultimate
benefit
is
of
course
like
in
the
case
of
any
contract
and
the
owner
of
the
property.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir.
that's
all
the
benefit
any
contractor
gets
out
of
it.
he
gets
the
bricks
and
the
lumber
and
the
nails
all
put
together
and
turns
it
over
to
the
owner,
he
no
longer
has
got
any
interest
in
it
at
all.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
no,
sir,
our
court
so
held.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes.
we
held
so
on
the
authority
of
kern.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
no,
sir,
the
use
tax
or
taxes
when
property
is
brought
in
to
the
state
from
without
the
state
for
use
or
consumption.
of
course,
it
came
in
and
the
title
being
in
the
government
or
actually
being
in
the
government's
hands
that
it
came
from
supply
depots
as
some
other
did.
so
you're
correct.
the
conventional
sales
or
use
tax
would
not
have
been
applicable
in
this
case.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
no,
sir.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
the
statute
simply
doesn't
provide.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
no,
sir.
the
conventional
complimentary
use
tax
now
is
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
using
that
which
is
brought
into
the
state
from
without
the
states.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir,
except
that
it
will
reach
profit
as
acquired
within
the
state
too,
if
it's
required
under
mr.
milton
p.
rice
--
circumstances.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
it's
a
conventional
use
tax
with
a
little
bit
broader
application
and
that
it
will
reach
property
acquired
originally
within
the
state
but
under
non-taxable
circumstances.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand
you.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
perhaps
it
would.
now,
you
can't
tax
per
curiam.
i
think
that's
the
essence
of
kern.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
also,
the
tax
doesn't
tax
until
it's
actually
--
until
the
contractor
actually
exercises
some
right
or
power
or
dominion
over
it.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
i
don't
think
that
we're
obliged
to
tax
it
every
year,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
now,
take
the
case
--
this
illustrate
--
our
conventional
sales
tax
exempts
casual
or
isolated
sales
like
if
you
are
--
would
sell
our
personal
automobile.
under
those
circumstances,
the
one
who
purchased
it
would
not
have
a
sales
tax
to
pay
on
it
but
the
minute
he
put
a
license
plate
on
it
to
drive,
he
would
have
to
show
that
a
sales
or
use
tax
has
been
paid
on
if
he
could
not
so
show,
he
had
have
to
pay
it
to
the
county
court
clerk
but
he
wouldn't
pay
it
for
once.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
but
i'm
not
convinced
from
what
you
were
driving
at
there
that
kern
would
reach
that.
in
the
kern,
i
think,
reaches
only
where
the
things
are
procured
for
in
the
name
of
the
government.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir.
and
they
held
immunity
as
far
as
that
aspect
of
it
is
concerned.
they
applied
the
tax
only
on
the
privilege
of
using.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
i
don't
think,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
that's
right.
the
transfer
of
it
is.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
the
use
of
it
by
a
private
person,
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
i
suppose
that
--
that
it
probably
would.
i
had
not
ever
considered
a
case
exactly
like
that
but
i
--
i
believe
that
it
fits
the
statutory
requisite
said.
it
would
be
an
exercise
of
power
or
dominion
consistent
with
ownership.
i
think
that
including
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
i
think
it
controls
along
with
other
cases
that
i
have
mentioned.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
that's
the
--
that
was
the
borg-warner
case
i
believe,
if
your
honor
please.
it
did
that
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
no,
sir.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
just
tangible
personal
property,
that's
all
we
reach
in
tennessee.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
in
the
manner
in
which
the
government
generally
instruction
to
do
it.
also
the
government's
reservation
of
control,
i'm
glad
that's
brought
up,
is
a
general
control
and
that's
spelled
out
in
the
contract.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
there's
too
much
--
there's
too
great
an
area
of
discretion
exercised
by
the
contractor
in
this
case,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
--
i
think
now
in
terms
of
a
mere
service.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
--
they
do.
the
contract
spells
out
that
they
shall
follow
the
general
directions
of
the
commission.
but
in
the
absence
of
specific
directions,
the
contractor
is
expected
to
use
his
own
best
skill
and
judgment.
and
the
history
of
this
thing
demonstrates
why
that
had
to
be.
the
atomic
energy
commission
has
no
skill
or
experience
or
know-how
in
the
operation
of
a
vast
industrial
complex.
they
went
and
got
one
of
the
titans
of
american
industry
who
did
have
that
experience.
that's
the
very
reason
they
were
engaged.
they
were
engaged
because
aec
had
to
engage
and
that's
the
way
to
get
the
job
done.
and
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
i
think
you
find,
they
insist,
if
your
honor
please,
that
there's
an
agency
relationship
there
and
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
there
is
a
distinct
difference,
of
course,
now
between
the
incidents
of
relationship
of
agency
and
that
one
of
the
independent
contractors.
and
a
great
point
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
esso
standard
case.
now,
right
there,
you
can
say
that
was
just
performance
of
services
that
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
i
don't
think
you'll
get
a
stronger
one
than
that
is
though
on
the
point.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
the
conventional
use
tax
reaches
merely
property
which
is
acquired
without
the
state
and
brought
in
to
the
state
for
use
or
consumption
therein.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
we
do
sir.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
no
this
one
--
this
tax
is
imposed
here.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes
sir.
the
tax
that
we
are
talking
about
here
enables
us
to
proceed
to
the
consumer
to
collect
the
tax
in
those
instances
where
can't
collect
it
from
the
vendor.
now
those
instances
are
numerous.
they're
not
just
what
cases
like
we
talked
about
here
where
the
government
immunity
might
be
ascertained.
they
cover
also
the
cases
where
you
have
an
insolvent
or
a
bankrupt
seller.
and
for
that
reason,
you
are
unable
to
get
the
tax
from
him.
if
we
had
only
the
conventional
use
tax,
we
couldn't
reach
it
under
that
either
because
that
covers
only
what's
brought
in
from
outside
the
state.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
on
the
buyer,
yes
sir.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
it
maybe
collected
from
a
seller
as
was
the
case
in
general
trading
company
against
iowa
and
maybe
one
or
two
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes
sir.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
the
taxable
end
is
not
even
there,
however
use,
--
the
use
by
the
buyer
within
the
taxing
state.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
no
sir.
i
don't
think
so.
i
wouldn't
go
that
far
at
all.
but
to
dispel
any
notion
that
this
tax
was
involved
for
the
purpose
of
reaching
one
particular
class
of
user,
i
would
mention
these
things.
now,
as
far
as
the
government
is
concern,
our
pressing
problem
we've
had
with
our
sales
in
use
tax
statute
from
the
very
start
is
our
political
subdivisions,
our
cities
and
counties.
they
decided
after
the
tax
have
been
in
effect
for
a
while
that
it
could
be
avoided
by
the
simple
stratagem
of
having
the
city
or
the
county
go
buy
the
building
materials
and
then
put
it
in
the
hands
of
the
contractor
and
thereby
insolate
the
whole
thing
from
tax.
oh,
i
--
because
i
think
i
mentioned
yesterday
i
have
cases
in
court
right
now
where
that
is
being
resisted.
but
on
the
authority
of
our
supreme
court's
decision
in
these
causes,
i
don't
think
they
can
get
anywhere.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
that
went
through
the
trial
court
and
then
abandoned
his
appeal
when
he
discovered
what
our
court
had
written
in
this
causes.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
no
sir,
we
do
not
report
our
nisi
prius
decisions.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
there
was
a
memorandum
opinion
of
some
two
pages
in
length
delivered
in
it.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
it
is
available.
i
know
it's
not
in
the
record
at
present.
i
--
i
can
obtain
the
copies
and
we
will
be
glad
to
do
so
if
the
court
would
desire.
but
it
certainly
would
attest
to
the
fact
that
our
courts
have
sustained
the
taxes
against
our
own
contractors
with
political
subdivisions.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
i
will
and
i
have
in
the
court
at
this
moment.
i
think
--
i
think
maybe
one
of
them
maybe
argued
today,
it's
on
demurrer
involving
some
state
contractors.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
that's
being
handled
by
an
associate
of
mine.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
but
we
consider
this
to
be
a
very
necessary
adjunct
to
our
sales
and
use
tax.
if
we
didn't
have
it,
we
know
that
considerable
amounts
of
revenue
would
--
would
escape
us.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
i
cannot
answer
that,
if
your
honor
please.
we
didn't
copy
any
of
the
state
statute
when
it
was
drawn,
i
know
that.
the
statute
was
prepared
in
--
in
my
office,
and
we
drew
it
ourselves.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
1955,
after
our
sales
tax
have
been
in
effect
for
some
eight
years.
and
it
was
the
product
of
experience
that
we
had
acquired
and
revenue
that
we
had
lost
simply
through
inability
for
one
reason
or
another
to
get
to
the
seller.
now,
proceeding
to
the
matter
of
the
relationship
between
these
contractors
and
the
atomic
energy
commission,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
implicit
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
a
tax
imposed
upon
a
private
person
will
not
be
struck
down
by
this
court
in
the
absence
of
circumstances
that
we
referred
to
yesterday.
the
only
way
that
i
can
see
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
this
tax
can
fall
is
for
this
court
to
find
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
they
exist
between
these
contractors
and
the
aec,
an
agency
relationship
such
as
to
make
these
contractors
as
i
think
they
insist,
and
was
insisted
in
the
south
carolina
case,
the
alter
ego
of
the
commission
so
as
to
make
them
one
and
inseparable
with
the
commission.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
the
facts
in
this
record
simply
do
not
bear
out
such
a
relationship.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
it
must
be
emphasized
perhaps
the
relationship
of
principle
and
agent
between
the
governor
--
the
government
and
a
private
person
is
a
most
unusual
thing.
the
federal
government
in
this
country
has
let
tens
of
thousands
of
contracts
over
the
years
of
its
history.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
it
is
perhaps
a
little
unusual
for
the
government
to
embark
upon
an
undertaking
of
precisely
this
nature
wherein
there
exist
a
government
monopoly,
yes
sir.
i
would
concede
that
it's
an
unusual
thing.
but
i
don't
think
the
existence
of
an
unusual
thing
is
a
sufficient
reason
to
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
there
certainly
are
extensive
controls
reserved.
i
will
concede
that
readily.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
there
are
always
controlled
reserved,
if
your
honor
please,
there
were
extensive
controls
in
alabama
versus
king
&
boozer.
the
government
had
the
very
right
anyway
to
control
virtually
everything
that
took
place
down
there.
i'd
say
down
to
the
driving
of
a
nail
even
if
they
saw
fit
to
exercise
it.
the
point
is
that
isn't
convenient
for
the
government
to
exercise
its
supervision
and
they
don't
expect
they're
intended
to.
but
the
right
is
there
always.
for
a
government,
money
is
involved
it's
historically
true,
i
think
the
government
reserves
as
much
control
as
is
necessary
to
prevent
a
wastage
of
government
money
and
--
and
resources
and
wastage
of
time.
all
of
those
factors
are
present
when
the
government
contracts
that
are
not
necessarily
present
when
private
parties
do.
and
let's
look
to
these
contracts
themselves.
now
this
to
me
is
something
i
had
great
trouble
with
all
along.
we
have
the
insistence
made
here
that
there
is
an
agency
relationship.
it's
been
made
i
might
add
ever
since
1947.
that
when
we
first
commenced
to
assert
any
right,
the
taxes
with
respect
to
this
contractors
as
soon
as
our
sales
tax
act
was
enacted
in
1947.
the
claim
was
instantly
made
that
these
contractors
are
agents
of
the
united
states
government
and
for
that
reason
immune.
so,
the
thought
was
foremost
in
the
mind
of
the
aec
and
--
and
those
representing
it.
but
over
the
course
of
the
existence
of
this
contract,
it
has
been
rewritten
some
37
times
at
the
outset
of
this
litigation,
37
times.
the
last
rewrite
is
stated
on
the
record
testimony
of
their
own
witnesses
was
to
reflect
more
accurately
the
operating
relationship
between
aec
and
its
contractors,
the
37th
rewrite
then
was
for
that
purpose
alone
according
to
their
testimony.
yet
nowhere,
nowhere
in
this
voluminous
documents,
of
these
documents
because
we've
got
two
contractors
here,
is
there
any
phraseology
whatsoever
that
would
import
agency.
now,
i
realized
and
i
wouldn't
insist
for
a
moment
that
labels
are
controlling.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
whether
that
questions
has
been
at
issue
for
as
long
as
it
has
here
and
they
wanted
to
spell
out
that
relationship
and
make
it
clear
if
in
fact
it
was
a
relationship
of
agents
that
they
would
have
said
so
in
terms
that
anybody
could've
understood.
that
is
a
point
i
simply
can't
get
away
from.
all
they
had
to
do
is
to
write
that
contract
and
agency
terms
but
they
didn't.
these
parties
are
referred
to
throughout
these
documents
as
contractor
not
agent.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
not
completely,
no
sir.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
for
purchasing
purposes
only.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
our
court
held
only
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
our
court
held
they
were
agencies
--
agents
for
the
purpose
of
procurement
only
but
not
for
the
general
performance
of
their
contract.
now,
that
was
--
they
recognized
the
limited
agency
as
could
exist
anytime
even
between
a
contractor
and
a
private
party.
we
don't
dispute
that
at
all.
but
the
agency
for
one
purpose
doesn't
mean
agency
for
all
purposes.
i
think
anyone
would
have
to
concede
that,
at
least
we
would
certainly
so
insist.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
no
sir.
i
don't
think
so
but
that
is
fact
certainly
that
bears
upon
the
relationship
of
what
the
parties
think
it
is,
is
always
pertinent
it
seems
to
me.
if
they
meant
for
it
to
be
that,
they
could
use
the
agents
as
usually
--
as
easily
as
they
use
contract.
and
they
knew
what
they
were
--
what
they
were
talking
about.
they
knew
what
their
aim
was.
they'd
been
telling
us
for
many
years
that
they
were
agents.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes
sir.
in
this
contract
they
did,
we
submit
in
essence
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well
that's
exactly
what
it
did,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
they
took
the
materials
that
were
acquired
in
the
government's
name
or
furnished
to
them
by
the
government
and
they
applied
skill
and
labor
to
these
materials
and
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes
sir,
that
was
their
business,
contracting.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes
sir,
i
think
the
state
could.
whether
it
chooses
to
or
not
is
--
is
something
else.
but
i
think
the
idea
in
(inaudible)
if
i
understand
it
correctly
these
--
you
had
materials
here,
property
that
was
escaping
the
normal
ad
valorem
taxes.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes
sir.
you
had
a
property
that
was
escaping
the
normal
state
ad
valorem
property
tax
because
the
title
to
it
was
in
the
government.
even
though
it
was
being
used
by
a
private
person
to
help
him
produce
profit
and
carry
on
his
business.
so
the
state
of
michigan,
characterized
its
ad
valorem
tax
as
being
also
upon
the
privilege
of
using
the
property
and
in
that
posture,
this
court
sustained
the
tax.
that's
--
as
i
read
(inaudible),
likewise,
the
town
of
muskegon
in
detroit
against
u.s.
to
the
companion
cases.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
apart
from
the
name
given
the
parties
whatever
significance
that
maybe
in
the
contract,
we
have
to
look
at
this
contract
itself
and
we
see
that
under
these
contractors
have
got
broad
latitude.
they're
expected
to
exercise
their
skill
and
their
care
and
their
judgement,
in
those
areas
where
they
weren't
given
specific
directions
by
aec.
the
record
shows
that
there
is
a
manual
put
out
for
the
general
guidance
of
the
people
at
oak
ridge
that
there
was
top
level
consultation
between
officials
of
carbide
and
officials
of
aec.
but
the
record
also
shows
that
all
of
the
thousands
of
employees
of
carbide
and
ferguson
for
that
matter
were
supervised
and
directed
and
controlled
by
their
own
superiors.
they
were
not
responsible
to
the
government
for
the
work
which
they
did.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes
sir
and
something
like
12,000
carbide
employees,
i
believe.
its
varied
from
time
to
time
depending
on
the
flow
of
the
work
there.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
there
is
not
detailed
supervision
if
your
honor
please
as
to
the
actual
day
to
day
performance
by
the
people
who
are
the
backbone
of
the
organization,
that
is
the
employees.
they
look
to
carbide
for
their
pay
checks,
if
they
have
agreements,
they
go
to
carbide
to
get
that
worked
out.
carbide
carries
the
social
security
and
workmen's
compensation
and
that
sort
of
thing.
these
people
are
the
--
there
is
no
privity
between
these
carbide
employees
and
the
government.
nobody
ever
goes
to
a
carbide
employee
on
the
job
and
say,
“you
do
this
or
you
do
that.”
those
orders
are
always
transmitted
through
channels.
so,
in
essence,
even
though
maybe
an
extraordinary
amount
of
control
is
reserve,
the
basic
relationship
is
disturbed
here.
these
people
are
working
pursuant
to
a
contact
to
achieve
a
desired
end.
that
end
can't
be
too
well
defined
because
we
don't
know
where
all
these
research
is
going
to
lead.
we
can't
know
it.
but
they
weren't
engaged
to
somebody
who
had
experienced
in
physics
and
chemistry
and
who
knew
something
about
historically
than
more
over
knew
something
about
running
a
giant
industrial
complex.
and
they
expected
to
utilize
that
skill
in
carrying
judgment
that
carbide
had
acquired
over
the
years
since
1920.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes
sir.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
the
other
side
evidently
thinks
its
material
to
theirs.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
i
have
to
meet
the
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
they
are
relying
and
have
relied
consistently
upon
the
livingston
case
from
south
carolina
which
the
states
don't
let
basis
entirely.
i
think
that
far
as
performing
service
is
concerned,
that's
what
any
contractor
is
engaged
to
do.
that's
what
the
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
--
contractors
in
king
&
boozer
were
engaged
to
do.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
it's
approximately
a
quarter
of
a
million
a
month,
that
figures
out
2,751,000
a
year
i
believe.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes
sir,
i
think
so.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
no
sir.
we
have
--
what
we've
taxed
is
the
use
of
property,
the
same
way
we
would
tax
it
to
anybody
else.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
no
sir.
our
tax
isn't
related
in
--
in
those
terms
at
all.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
we
lay
the
tax
if
your
honor
please
upon
the
privilege
of
using
tangible
personal
property
in
the
performance
of
a
contract.
we
measure
the
tax.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
the
value
of
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
of
using
the
property.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
it
was
essentially
the
same
thing.
i
believe
part
of
the
king
&
boozer
taxes
were
sales
taxes,
but
part
of
them
were
conventional
use
taxes,
that's
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
the
title
however,
did
pass
to
the
government
immediately
upon
delivery
of
the
goods,
to
the
jobsite
and
their
acceptance
by
government
inspectors.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
cost-plus-fixed-fee,
yes
sir.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
you
have
the
companion
case
there
if
your
honor
please,
of
curry
against
united
states
which
was
a
use
tax.
now
that's
where
the
taxable
incident
had
to
be
the
use
by
the
contractor,
so
you
didn't
have
a
vendor
involved
in.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes,
sir.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well
actually,
it
was
a
fixed
fee,
all
they
had
involved
there.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes
sir,
that's
all
the
contractor
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
i
think
all
contracts
since
--
shortly
after
world
war
i
had
been
cost-plus-fixed-fee.
cost-plus
percentage
has
been
out
for
some
time.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
no,
it
had
had
to
be
fixed-fee
under
the
federal
statutes.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
it
would
take
care
of
that
aspect
of
it.
i
don't
think
it
would
take
care
of
the
companion
use
tax
situation
in
curry.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
that's
correct.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
but
i
think
curry
does.
that's
the
companion
case
to
king
&
boozer
involving
the
alabama
use
tax
decided
the
same
time
that
king
&
boozer
was.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
it's
our
ordinary
use
tax
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
that's
the
conventional
use
tax.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
it
wholly
analogous,
if
your
honor
please,
to
the
conventional
use
tax
is
simply
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
it
gives
a
little
bit
broader
reach
and
that
you
can
get
to
the
property
acquired
within
the
state.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
no
sir,
not
at
all.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
the
ordinary
use
tax
couldn't
have
been
applied
so
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
no
sir.
i
think
what
they
held
was
the
ordinary
sales
tax
couldn't
be
applied
to
the
case
and
the
ordinary
use
tax
to
being
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
i
don't
recall
if
your
honor
please,
that
our
court
dealt
with
it
in
those
terms
told.
it
held
that
there
was.
there
couldn't
be
any
tax
on
procurement
because
procurement
was
done
as
an
agent.
that
would
i
suppose,
cut
out
the
conventional
use
tax
as
readily
as
it
would
to
conventional
sales
tax.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
when
you
put
it
on
procurement.
but
now,
when
you
attach
it
clearly
to
a
subsequent
use
without
regard
to
procurement
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
--
well,
then
you've
got
a
horse
with
a
different
color
entirely.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
perhaps
so.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
i
think
the
reasoning
in
curry
controls.
it
leads
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
our
court
so
held
as
far
as
procurement
but
not
for
the
general
performance
of
the
contract.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
procurement
is
only
one
phase
of
it.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes
sir.
but,
even
a
conventional
use
tax,
the
taxable
incident
is
use.
it's
imposed
as
a
compliment
to
a
tax
on
procurement
or
sale
or
purchase.
but
it's
only
to
enable
the
state
to
get
the
tax
on
that
which
is
used
within
the
state
which
was
not
taxed
because
it
was
involved
in
the
state.
now,
this
tax
we've
got
enables
us
to
get
the
property
even
what
--
that
was
acquired
in
the
state.
but
we
make
the
taxable
incident
its
use,
without
regard
to
the
circumstances
of
procurement.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
so,
i
think
we
come
to
this.
we
have
to
find
here
that
for
the
general
performance
of
this
contract
and
in
all
respects,
these
persons
are
indeed
agencies
of
the
federal
government.
if
we'd
also
find,
if
we
find
as
the
tennessee
supreme
court
did
that
they
are
private
parties,
that
they
are
private
contractors
operating
for
a
profit
just
like
any
other,
well
then,
the
tax
is
applicable
and
is
not
--
is
not
boarded
by
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
constitutional
immunity
because
we're
simply
not
taxing
the
government.
we're
taxing
a
private
party
who
incidentally
happens
to
be
dealing
with
the
government.
it
would
make
no
difference
at
all
if
we
were
dealing
with
the
city
of
nashville
or
shelby
county
or
with
any
of
the
other
instrumentalities
in
the
state
of
tennessee
or
the
state
itself.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
will
carbide
and
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
--
ferguson
pay?
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
that's
difficult
to
say
if
your
honor
please,
carbide
has
a
private
installation
at
columbia
which
isn't
related
to
this
at
all.
it's
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
if
it
did
this
and
this
alone
and
had
no
other
connection
in
the
state,
i
would
say
unquestionably,
it
would
pay
a
corporation
excise
tax
which
is
measured
by
net
income,
like
every
other
corporation
doing
business
in
the
state
would
pay.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
the
franchise
and
excise
tax
are
blend
together
in
tennessee
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
--
as
they
do
in
many
states.
franchise
is
measured
by
net
worth,
excise,
by
net
income.
beyond
that,
i
can
think
of
no
taxes
that
they'd
be
required
to
pay
at
all,
unless
they're
liable
for
this
one.
and
others
that
are
laid
on
what
they
do
in
the
performance
of
their
contract
to
oak
ridge.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
the
tax
is
levied,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
tangible
personal
property.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
in
this
case,
owned
by
the
government,
it
would
--
mr.
milton
p.
rice
--
make
no
difference.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes
sir.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
or
no
matter
where
it
was
gotten.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
if
it
is
used
by
them
in
the
performance
of
their
contract
or
the
fulfillment
of
contract
obligations,
we
assert
the
right
to
tax
them.
that's
the
essence
of
our
position
here.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
the
essence
of
our
position
is,
if
this
property
is
being
used
by
this
contractor
in
the
performance
of
his
contract
or
to
fulfill
his
contract
obligations,
the
state
has
a
right
to
tax
the
contractor
for
the
privilege
of
so
using
it.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes
sir.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
they
would
as
a
corporation
be
required
to
pay
to
tennessee
on
apportionment
basis
like
every
other
corporation
would
a
--
what's
deemed
to
be
a
fair
share
of
its
net
income
or
rather
a
tax
based
on
a
fair
share
apportioned
to
tennessee.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
if
it
paid
the
tax
but
now
i'd
have
to
add
this
if
your
honor
please,
if
they
didn't
have
this
private
operation
in
tennessee,
they
might
resist
the
franchise
and
excise
taxes
on
the
same
basis,
if
they
resist
this
one
here.
i
don't
know
what
they'd
do.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
well,
if
they
were
able
they
--
they
could
argue
that
they
were
in
fact
agents
for
the
federal
government
and
that
was
their
sole
connection,
their
sole
reason
for
being
in
tennessee.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
they
might
very
well
try
to
avoid
those
taxes,
i
don't
know.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
our
tax
is
laid
however,
on
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
business
in
corporate
form
in
tennessee.
now,
it's
not
an
income
tax
like
most
states
have.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
it's
measured
by
the
net
income
but
the
taxable
privilege
is
engaging
in
business
in
the
form
of
a
corporation.
mr.
milton
p.
rice
yes
sir,
i
assume
they
are.
i
don't
have
any
first
hand
information
about
that.
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
it.
my
time
is
up
i
believe.
