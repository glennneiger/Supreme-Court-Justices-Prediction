mr.
r.
r.
kramer
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
the
court
--
supreme
court
of
tennessee,
in
determining
that
this
use
by
the
government
of
government-owned
property
was
taxable,
rendered
it's
conclusion
largely
or
based
its
conclusion
largely,
in
note
from
its
opinion,
on
a
decision
it
made
that
the
relationship
which
existed
between
carbide
on
the
one
hand
and
ferguson
on
the
other
and
the
atomic
energy
commission
for
the
relationship
of
a
principle
and
an
independent
contractor
and
not
a
principle
in
agent
or
principle
in
service.
getting
back
toward
the
question
that
mr.
justice
goldberg
asked
a
moment
ago,
i
want
to
address
myself
for
just
a
few
moments
to
that
question.
i
want
to
point
out
without
reading
from
the
contract,
the
force
of
which
was
read
by
my
co-counsel
here,
that
the
atomic
energy
commission,
in
awarding
this
contract
for
the
operation
of
this
great
complex
to
the
equipment
and
the
operations
at
oak
ridge,
included
also
the
operations
of
the
atomic
energy
at
paducah,
kentucky
and
it
--
under
its
contract,
made
with
--
i'll
talk
first
about
carbide,
with
carbide
turned
over
to
them
the
operation.
but
how
did
it
turn
over
those
operations?
in
order
to
be
an
independent
contractor,
the
person
to
whom
the
operations
were
turned
over,
must
have
surrendered
all
control
except
as
to
end
results.
there's
no
doubt
about
that
principle.
but
what
did
we
do
here?
they
reserved
--
the
atomic
energy
commission
or
the
government
reserved
the
right
to
alter,
to
change,
to
control,
a
portion
of
that
was
read
to
your
honors.
what
did
they
do?
this
record
shows
that
pursuant
to
that
authority,
the
atomic
energy
commission
issued
to
carbide
and
similar
to
ferguson
manuals.
those
manuals,
numbers,
i
don't
recall
the
number,
amounting
to
several
hundred
pages
in
each
one.
and
in
those
manuals
were
set
out
in
detail
what
do
carbide
must
do,
how
you
must
handle
this,
how
you
must
handle
that,
not
just
the
end
result
of
the
appreciable
or
the
nuclear
materials
but
how
we
must
do
it.
how
far
did
we
go
in
that?
they
went
so
far,
and
may
it
please
this
honorable
court,
and
we
must
remember
that
every
item
of
machinery,
every
item
of
equipment,
every
chair
down
there,
every
automobile,
every
piece
of
pencil,
every
piece
of
paper,
every
pencil,
every
pen
that
carbide
used
or
its
employees
used
there
in
the
operation
of
this
contract
belong
to
the
federal
government.
carbide
had
nothing
there
but
eight
automobiles
which
is
really
--
which
is
leased
to
the
federal
government.
everything
that
was
there
that
carbide
used
to
the
last
analysis
belongs
to
the
federal
government.
now,
how
close
did
the
federal
government
control
the
use
of
those?
why
it's
said
that
only
these
people
can
operate
the
automobile,
only
these
people
can
drive
a
truck,
you
can
only
go
here
with
a
truck,
you
can
only
go
here
with
an
automobile.
they
exercise
that
complete
control
just
as
in
the
illustration.
now,
i
want
to
get
back
to
the
question
that
your
honor
asked
a
moment
ago
on
how
far
on
the
labor
question
did
to
go
on
which
your
honor
has
had
something
they
argue
with
and
then
in
which
i
have
--
fortunately
--
unfortunately
had
some
connection
as
some
they
know.
but
how
far
did
they
go?
it
is
true
that
this
contract
specify,
i
don't
recall
the
page
number
here,
that
the
employees
of
carbide,
the
same
is
true
in
ferguson,
and
one
argument
i
make
is
to
--
what
i
want
to
make
is
to
the
other
except
the
different
nature
of
jobs,
that
the
employees,
and
there
were
some
10,000
or
12,000
of
them
from
time
to
time
employed
at
a
single
time
by
carbide,
there
was
1000
to
1,500
a
times
employed
by
ferguson
maybe
a
few
more,
that
those
--
while
the
government
itself
had
about
1000
to
1200
employees
there
on
the
carbide
job,
supervising
as
i'll
come
to,
but
what
those
employees,
what
was
the
relationship?
it's
true
they
were
the
employees
of
the
agent.
they
were
carbide's
employees,
carbide
pay
them
but
pay
them
with
money
furnished
by
the
government.
but,
carbide
was
not
free,
may
it
please
the
court,
generally,
in
the
field
of
labor
relations.
here's
what
actually
happened,
both
carbide
and
ferguson
were
under
this
situation
that
the
atomic
energy
actually
controlled
those
employees
the
numbers
of
them,
the
hours
they
worked.
if,
may
it
please
the
court,
carbide
decided
that
they
wanted
to
work
overtime,
any
group
of
employees,
before
they
could
do
it,
carbide
had
to
go
with
the
atomic
energy
commission
and
say,
“can
we
work
with
these
employees
overtime?”
if
carbide
wanted
to
give
merits,
increases
and
wages,
it
had
to
go
to
the
atomic
energy
commission.
if
carbide
wanted
to
negotiate
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
its
employees
in
which
it
did
that
some
members
may
know,
but
what
did
it
had
to
do?
it
had
to
get
that
employ
--
that
--
that
collective
bargaining
agreement
approved
by
the
atomic
energy
commission.
it
had
to
--
it
was
obligated
also
that
it
had
to
work
its
employees
under
the
tennessee
elective
workmen's
compensation
law,
workmen's
compensations
elective
remedy
in
tennessee
rather
than
the
--
and
thus
getting
around
both
by
an
employer
or
an
employee.
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
no,
it
--
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
no.
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
and
i
understand
your
--
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
the
company
determined
in
its
discretion
that
it
wanted
to
have
the
union
job,
if
they
we
wanted
to,
of
course,
they
couldn't
have
in
tennessee,
but
it
wanted
to
have
a
(inaudible),
a
union
shop,
and
a
(inaudible)
on
certain
conditions.
but
before
it
could
go
ahead
and
--
i
enter
in
to
an
agreement
for
that
union
shop,
it
had
to
get
the
approval
of
the
atomic
energy
commission.
the
atomic
energy
commission
could
refuse
that
and
did
refuse
it
as
the
certain
groups
at
one
time
or
another.
but
the
whole
basis
of
this
and
true
and
part
of
this
is
on
control
of
cost,
your
honor,
but
not
entirely
on
control
of
cost.
aec
control
the
hours.
let
me
indicate
another
thing
in
this
matter.
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
yes,
hours
relate
to
cost,
but
may
it
please
the
court,
hours
also
rate
--
relate
to
rate
of
production.
hours
do
not
relate
solely
to
cost,
hours
relate
to
relate
--
rate
of
production
in
which
was
the
thing
that
aec
was
interested
in.
let
me
point
out
this,
this
record
shows
that
from
time
to
time,
one
of
these
inspectors,
and
there
were
many
of
them,
supervisors,
of
--
for
carbide
by
aec,
aec
had
a
1000
to
1200
on
there
came
along
and
he
said,
“why
carbide
you've
got
25
--
you've
got
25
weekly
on
this
job
today,
you
want
to
have
but
five,
get
20
of
them
more.”
and
they've
got
20
more.
now,
your
honor
may
say
--
reason
this
out
that
that
was
again
a
saving
of
cost
but
they
could
say
to
carbide,
"put
those
quickly
over
on
another
job
and
let
them
work
over
there.”
and
they
didn't
do
that.
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
in
cost-plus-fixed-fee
contractors,
they,
of
course,
enters
a
--
but
they
--
may
it
please
the
court,
we
say
they
do
not
exercise
the
same
degree
of
control.
this
--
their
degree
of
control
was
greater
than
it's
in
the
ordinary
cost-plus-fixed-fee
contract
and
i
think
that's
established
clearly
in
the
testimony
of
these
witnesses.
one
thing
more
i
want
to
point
out
is
to
how
far
these
controls
went.
if
a
lawsuit
were
brought
against
carbide
down
there
of
something
going
on
with
the
operation,
who
looks
after
the
defense
of
that?
carbide
has
to
go
to
the
atomic
energy
commission
and
say,
“what
shall
i
do
with
this
lawsuit?
shall
i
defend
it?
shall
we
employ
counsel?
you
don't
employ
counsel
you're
going
to
turn
it
over
to
the
department
of
justice?”
the
same
thing
was
true
with
reference
to
many
of
this
activity.
i
could
go
on
indefinitely,
if
time
permitted,
to
show
--
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
pardon?
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
lawsuits,
well
--
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
occasionally,
the
atomic
energy
says,
“we're
going
to
take
care
of
them.”
occasionally,
atomic
energy
says,
“we're
going
to
ask
to
the
department
of
justice.
they
may
refuse
and
then
or
you
go
ahead
and
employ
private
counsel.”
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
generally,
your
honor,
i
think
50%
of
the
time,
private
counsels
employed,
that's
only
an
approximation.
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
private
counsel
is
employed
by
the
contractor.
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
yes
sir,
the
expense
of
defending
those
fee
--
those
fees
for
the
counsel
are
refunded.
carbide
gets
the
refund
of
those,
they
are
paid
back
and
they
paid
out
of
this
government
money.
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
no,
sir,
no
cost
added
to
that.
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
fee
of
carbide
is
not
based
exactly
on
any
percentage
of
expenditure.
the
expenditures
by
carbide
in
its
contract
may
go
up
and
down
thousands
of
dollars
during
a
period
of
six
months
or
a
year
or
there
is
no
adjustment
to
the
fees.
now,
of
course,
if
a
great
big
new
project
is
added
on
to
carbide,
carbide
run
the
laboratories,
carbide
run
the
machine
shops,
carbide
run
the
machine
--
the
operating
park
where
the
materials
were
refined,
carbide
ordered
the
large
part
of
the
chemicals,
carbide
had
a
broad
scope
not
only
here
but
at
paducah,
kentucky
and
on
those
propositions,
carbide's
--
there's
fluctuated
from
day
to
day,
the
amount
of
work,
they
did
fluctuate
from
day
to
day.
they
may
have
had
14,000
people
employed
by
the
one
day.
carbide
may
have
had
8,000
the
next,
that
didn't
mean
a
necessary
a
change
in
fee.
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
the
government
had
the
carbide
from
1000
to
12,000
people
sitting
there,
sitting
over
their
hand,
over
the
--
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
i
don't
--
most
of
those
supervise
the
details,
may
it
please
the
court.
they
supervise
them
to
this
extent.
they
start
--
would
start
to
put
in
a
piece
of
machinery
or
a
piece
of
equipment.
carbide
with
top
to
aec
people,
we
think
that
you
can
do
a
better
job,
you
can
save
a
little
time,
you
can
save
a
little
money,
you
can
do
something
by
changing
this
piece
of
machinery
and
install
somebody
else.
we
have
some
know-how.
aec
said,
“no,
we
don't
think
that's
proper.
before
we'll
agree
to
that,
we
are
going
to
examine
ourselves
and
we
are
going
to
give
the
final
word
on
whether
you
can
put
that
in
or
whether
you
can't
put
that
in.”
“we
think,”
says
carbide,
“we
--
you
can
save
money
and
time
by
moving
this
piece
of
equipment
or
this,
this
series
of
this
change
or
from
here
over
to
here.”
who
controls?
not
carbide.
carbide
can
recommend
but
carbide's
engineer
will
sit
down
beside
the
engineer
of
aec
and
aec
makes
the
final
decision
in
all
of
those
instances
under
this
record.
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
carbide,
may
it
please
the
court,
maintains
a
large
purchasing
organization
and
buys
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
material.
carbide
has
expert
engineers
who
study
this
proposition
and
sit
down
there
with
the
aec
engineers
and
participate
in
the
discovery.remember
that
this
is
a
new
piece
of
industrial
development.
and
aec
or
carbide
does
have
a
lot
to
know-how
but
not
with
atomic
energy
but
it
has
capable
engineers
and
"we
want
the
best
engineers
we
can
get"
says
the
atomic
energy
commission.
you
put
your
good
engineers
down
here.
we're
--
you're
going
to
get
your
salaries
out
of
us
but
we're
not
going
to
let
that
engineer
go
ahead
and
just
say
what
shall
be
done.
we're
going
to
reserve
the
right
to
control
him
and
direct
him
but
we
want
the
benefit
of
his
services
and
we're
willing
to
pay
for
it
because
he
can
help
us.
we
can't
go
out
and
employ
all
these
engineers
ourselves.
first
--
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
no
sir,
your
honor
this
was
not
led
by
competitive
bidding.
carbide
went
in
in
1940
--
well,
i
don't
remember
the
year,
way
back
under
the
manhattan
district
before
the
atomic
energy
act
and
carbide
had
done
some
similar
work
not
quite
as
broad
as
this
work.
and
then
because
carbide
had
know-how
and
had
experience
and
knew
the
situation,
the
government
went
to
carbide
and
negotiated
out
this
contract
and
it
was
in
negotiated
contract
and
it's
been
in
effect.
the
contractor
is
--
i
think
chief
justice
asked
about
how
long
it
ran,
it
was
originally
and
executed
back
in
1946
and
it
was
renewed
again
in
the
final
long
run
in
the
1960
then
an
extension
later
on.
there
was
--
it
was
the
intention
to
be
continued
from
time
to
time
right
on
and
on.
carbide
rendered
enormous
services.
you
take
carbide's
chemist
and
so
on.
we
didn't
have
perhaps
the
time
to
--
and
we
didn't
--
i
mean
--
i'm
saying
the
atomic
energy
commission,
though
carbide
is
my
client,
atomic
energy
commission
needed
someone
to
run
its
laboratories.
it
employed
as
a
part
of
its
laboratory
for
that
new
chemical
processes
and
for
medical
health
and
for
discovery
purposes.
it
said
to
carbide,
“give
us
some
chemists,
give
us
some
people
who
can
understand
the
chemistry
of
this
product
then
what
do
we
do?
they
put
that
chemist
into
our
library.
we
put
our
chemist
into
the
library.
they
study
the
effect
on
health
and
conditions.
they
study
all
of
these
effects.
but
before
the
decision
is
reached
on
what
to
do
and
how
to
do
it,
carbide
says
to
them,
“this
is
what
we're
going
to
do
but
we
do
get
the
valuable
health
and
assistance
from
these
people.
highest
trained
people
in
america
is
high.”
but
nevertheless,
it
is
not
subject
as
a
matter
of
this
handling.
it's
not
subject
to
--
only
the
end-product
by
the
contractor.
it
is
a
detailed
supervision
from
day
to
day,
week
by
week,
month
by
month
and
year
by
year
and
we
work
it
out
together.
but
we,
aec
says,
it
has
the
final
control.
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
no,
no,
it
has
1000
to
1200
people.
carbide
had
about
12,000
at
that
time
when
it
--
aec
if
i
said,
i
--
i
misstated
myself.
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
now,
carbide
has
a
thousand
--
i
think
it
--
it
shows
carbide
sometimes
has
managed
1500
to
1800.
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
oh,
not
entirely.
supervising
they
were
engaged
in
sitting
down
here
at
the
drafting
table
and
having
their
draft.
they
were
engaged
in
helping
work
out
the
details
with
these
people.
they
were
supervising
the
installation
of
machinery
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
part
of
them.
but
others
were
chemist
sitting
here
in
the
laboratory
helping
to
study
along
with
the
--
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
they
were
not
in
partnership
because
we
did
not
agree
to
the
partnership
but
we
did
supervise
what
the
appellate
did.
here's
the
chemist
from
aec
sitting
here,
here's
the
chemist
from
carbide
sitting
here.
the
chemist
from
carbide
said,
"that's
wrong.
let's
try
it
this
way."
and
(inaudible)
the
chemist
some
carbide
control.
they
were
not
in
partnership,
they
work
together
but
they
were
not
--
this
is
not
a
partnership
agreement
or
partnership
arrangement
or
operation.
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
no,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
that's
correct.
i
agree
with
your
honor.
but
the
difference
is
here,
if
your
honor
awarded
said
--
employ
a
contractor
to
build
a
house
and
the
contractor
agreed
to
build
it
at
so
much
a
day
or
a
month
or
a
year
on
this
particular
time.
and
if
your
honor
reserve
the
right
and
exercise
this
right
that
was
done
here
to
change
from
two-storey
to
three-storey,
to
change
the
type
of
placing
on
that
house
from
brick
to
stone,
to
change
the
whole
interior
and
the
number
of
rooms
on
it.
your
honor
went
there
from
day
to
day
or
have
somebody
else
go
there
from
day
to
day
and
supervise
that,
then
your
--
he
would
not
be
an
independent
contractor.
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
well,
i
think
sometimes
that
happens,
your
honor,
but
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
going
to
argue
with
that
question.
but
i'm
saying
that
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
what
we
are
doing
here
and
the
suggestion
that
--
the
question
suggested
by
your
honor.
mr.
r.
r.
kramer
i'm
sorry
i
don't
