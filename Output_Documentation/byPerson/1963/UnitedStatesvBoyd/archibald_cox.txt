mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
by
the
united
states
and
two
government
contractors
from
an
adverse
decision
by
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
in
an
intergovernmental
immunity
tax
case.
the
question
presented
is
whether
tennessee
may
constitutionally
asses
a
tax
upon
the
use
of
government
property
in
the
operation
of
the
government's
oak
ridge
atomic
energy
facilities,
the
operation
for
the
sole
account
of
the
government
by
contractors
who
engaged
to
supply
managerial
skills
and
services
without
risk
of
loss
or
hope
of
profit
beyond
the
flat
fee
for
their
services
and
overhead
expenses.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
essentially
very
simple.
the
atomic
energy
act
of
1946
and
1954
contemplate
that
production
facilities,
like
oak
ridge,
will
be
owned
by
the
united
states
or
technically,
by
the
atomic
energy
commission
as
agent
for
the
united
states.
but
they
authorized
the
commission
to
draw
upon
private
industry
for
managerial
skill
and
administrative
services
and
the
like
by
entering
into
management
contract
of
bringing
those
services
and
skills
to
service
for
the
government's
account.
the
identity
of
the
contractors
at
any
given
facility
may
change
from
time
to
time
or
it
maybe
continuous,
as
indeed
it
has
in
the
case
of
union
carbide
here.
in
the
present
case,
carbide
and
ferguson
were
the
contractors
at
oak
ridge
at
all
times
material
to
this
proceeding.
the
carbide
contract
can
be
summarized
in
four
points.
i
shall
refer
to
it
in
a
little
more
detail
in
the
course
of
the
argument
but
it's
enough
for
now,
i
think,
simply
to
mention
these
highlights.
the
first
place,
carbide
undertakes,
and
this
is
frankly
the
language
of
the
contract,
to
manage,
operate
and
maintain
the
plants
in
accordance
with
instructions
from
the
atomic
energy
commission.
the
character
of
the
work
done,
impart
the
schedule
of
production
entirely,
is
determined
by
the
atomic
energy
commission.
carbide,
in
effect,
undertakes
to
run
the
plants,
not
to
sell
anything
to
the
government
and
except
in
the
sense
of
running
the
plants
not
even
to
make
anything
that
it
is
to
deliver
to
the
government.
indeed,
the
contract
expressly
stipulates
that
carbide
makes
no
representation
or
warranty
whatsoever
and
assumes
no
responsibility
or
obligation
that
the
plants
can
be
operated
successfully.
it
just
goes
in
there
and
supplies
its
services.
third,
i
would
emphasize
that
all
the
plant
and
facilities,
all
the
equipment,
all
the
materials
and
product
belong
to
the
government
in
every
substantial
sense.
the
working
capital
leave
and
this
is
supplied
by
the
government.
carbide
doesn't
bring
any
of
its
money
to
the
enterprise.
it
all
comes
from
special
government
bank
accounts
on
which
it
withdrew.
all
the
risks
are
on
the
government.
and
fourth,
it
should
be
noted
that
what
carbide
receives
is
a
flat
fee
for
performing
what
i
call
leave
services.
the
fee
covers
its
profit
and
in
addition,
it
covers
salaries
of
corporate
officials,
a
certain
amount
of
backup
administrative
services
for
them
in
the
home
office
and
perhaps
other
branch
offices
and
a
certain
amount
of
overhead.
i
suppose
it's
theoretically
possible,
perhaps
practically
possible
that
carbide
can
increase
the
amount
of
its
net
income
a
little
bit
by
curtailing
the
amount
of
corporate
officers
and
services
that
goes
to
this
or
the
amount
of
overhead.
but
that
is
the
only
conceivable
way
that
--
that
carbide
can
affect
its
net
income.
in
all
other
respects,
it's
exactly
like
a
salary
and
that
is
certainly
small.
this
was,
in
other
words,
essentially
in
undertaking
the
supply
management
services
for
a
fee
in
operating
the
properties
of
the
united
states
subject
to
such
directions
as
the
united
states
chose
to
give
and
for
the
sole
use
and
benefit
of
the
public
or
of
the
united
states.
ferguson's
contract
was
essentially
similar,
although
it
related
to
modification
of
the
facilities
in
the
nature
of
construction
work
rather
than
to
their
operation
in
terms
of
producing
products
or
research.
and
it
involved
the
kind
of
services
that
are
preformed
under
other
construction
contracts.but
here
again,
the
only
undertaking
you
will
find
when
you
read
the
contract
was
to
supply
services
for
a
fee.
there
was
no
responsibility
for
the
result.
no
promise
in
the
contract
to
build
any
particular
building
and
indeed,
at
the
time
the
contract
was
executed,
no
one
knew
just
what
the
work
would
be.
ferguson,
like
carbide,
used
exclusively
government
property,
government
equipment,
all
the
way
through
the
operations
from
start
to
finish
and
government
money
unlike
any
other
edge.
this
contract
was
unlike
other
construction
contracts.
indeed,
unlike
other
construction
contracts
even
cost-plus-fixed-fee
contract
that
the
commission
has
at
oak
ridge.
we're
not
claiming
that
the
doctrines
we
espouse
here
apply
to
all
use
of
property
under
all
construction
contracts.
under
these
contracts
there
was
acquired
a
very
large
quantity
and
a
very
great
variety
of
property
for
use
at
oak
ridge
either
in
operating
the
facilities
or
in
the
modification
and
enlargement
of
the
ferguson
contract.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
hired
the
carpenters
and
electricians.
it
supplied
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
there
were
some
sub-contractors
and
there
were,
no
doubt,
some
direct
employees
as
on
any
construction
job.
what
i
conceive
that
it
brought
to
the
operation
was
the
organization,
administrative
organization,
the
managerial,
the
executive
talent
and
a
considerable
amount
of
construction
know-how.
these
were
really
the
things
the
aec
got
from.
mr.
archibald
cox
coordinating
and
planning
but
also
seeing
that
it
was
done
through
employees
they
hired.
the
reason,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
it
was
done
this
way
instead
of
by
the
usual
structure
program
--
contract
was
three-fold.
in
the
first
place,
these
modifications
came
in
the
course
of
a
rapidly
changing
technology.
the
aec
knew
it
was
going
to
have
to
make
modification.
at
the
time
they
signed
the
contract,
they
didn't
really
know
just
what
it
was
going
to
be.
second,
ferguson's
contract,
except
for
one
subsequent
aspect
of
it,
related
almost
exclusively
to
facilities
that
were
in
production.
that's
why
they
build
something
new
on
a
vacant
lot.
and
the
work,
therefore,
had
to
be
tied
in
very
closely
with
the
production
schedules,
in
other
words,
the
carbide
was
doing
and
coordinated
with
them.
and
then
there
were
aspects
where
they
didn't
know
just
how
they
were
going
to
do
some
of
these
things
that
they
would
fit
in
with
production.
so
ferguson
said,
in
effect,
"well,
we'll
come
and
do
this
work
as
you
schedule
it,
as
you
tell
us
to
do
it.
we
will
supply
the
know-how
that
a
big
construction
company
has.
and
we
will
supply
the
executive
organization.
now,
you
give
us
the
property,
you
give
us
the
money,
you
assume
all
of
risks,
you
supply
the
working
capital
and
equipment
and
we'll
do
this
work
of
pooling
our
skill
with
your
directions."
and
with
carbide,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
looking
over
their
shoulder
too
because
it
had
to
be
fitted
in
with
the
carbide's
--
carbide's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
bricks
and
--
the
bricks
and
lumber
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
structural
steel,
the
cranes,
the
automobiles,
the
typewriters
are
on
the
carbide
side
of
the
operation.
the
chemicals,
the
computers,
all
was
owned
and
supplied
we
would
say,
i'll
explain
that
in
a
moment,
by
the
united
states.
it
was
procured
in
two
ways.
part
of
it,
the
lesser
part
in
the
case
of
the
carbide
operations,
but
part
of
it
may
substantial
impart,
was
obtained
by
carbide
or
ferguson
as
agent
for
the
united
states
using
government
money
withdrawn
from
a
special
account
with
title
being
bought
--
title
being
taken
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
and
the
only
obligation
to
pay
being
that
of
the
united
states.
and
that
is
true
of
absolutely
everything
except
to
few
carbide
automobiles
that
happen
to
be
there
and
even
those
were
leased
to
the
united
states
for
use
in
this
operation.
that
covered
absolutely
all
the
property
and
equipment.
now,
much
of
this
property,
which
was
used,
as
tennessee
says,
by
this
contractor,
was
direct
procurement
by
the
aec.
the
larger
part
of
it,
indeed,
in
case
of
the
carbide
contract,
it
place
the
order,
the
materials,
the
bricks
and
mortar
as
you
say
or
the
chemicals,
supplies
and
equipment
were
shipped
on
the
aec's
directions
and
were
used
in
operating
the
facilities
or
in
making
the
modifications.
what
carbide
and
ferguson
did
was
essentially
what
any
agent
would
do
in
obtaining
property
for
its
principle
and
in
using
the
property
of
its
principle.
tennessee
has
a
--
mr.
archibald
cox
substantial
periods.
they
have,
in
fact,
run
for
a
period
of
years.
they'd
been
extended
from
time
to
time.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
--
all
would
continue
in
the
united
states.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
all
remain
in
the
united
states.
none
of
it
could
pass,
could
possibly
pass
to
either
of
these
contractors.
the
tennessee,
as
i
say,
had
a
--
has
a
sales
tax,
the
ordinary
retail
and
sales
tax
and
the
compensating
use
tax
with
which
the
court
is
familiar
that
cover
articles
obtained
outside
the
state
and
paid
a
sales
tax
and
are
used
inside
the
state.
in
addition,
it
has
a
correlative
provision
that
it's
a
special
applicability
here
that
appears
on
page
55
of
the
government's
brief.
the
critical
words,
i
skipped
the
unimportant
ones,
provide
that,
it's
right
--
just
about
the
middle
of
55
it
begins,
provide
that
where
a
contractor
uses
tangible
personal
property
in
the
performance
of
his
contract,
whether
the
title
be
in
the
contractor
or
any
other
person
or
whether
the
title
holder
of
such
property
would
be
subject
to
pay
the
sales
or
use
tax,
except
where
there's
a
church,
such
contractor
or
sub-contractor
shall
pay
a
tax
at
the
rate
prescribed
by
section
67
something
around
there
which,
of
course,
is
the
rate
prescribe
for
the
state
sales
tax
measured
by
the
purchase
price
or
fair
market
value
of
the
property
whichever
is
greater.
and
last,
there
has
perviously
been
a
sales
or
use
tax
collected.
acting
under
the
tennessee
statutes,
the
tennessee
taxing
authorities
collected
both
sales
taxes
on
these
sales
to
the
united
states
and
use
taxes.
the
taxes
were
paid
by
the
contractor
with
money
furnished
by
the
united
states.
of
course,
it
had
to
be
money
furnished
by
the
united
states
because
all
the
money
in
this
enterprise
was
put
up
by
the
united
states.
and
suit
was
brought
for
refunds
by
the
united
states
and
the
two
contractors
as
nominal
titles.
i
would
emphasize
that
the
government,
here,
is
the
only
real
party
in
interest
that
the
outcome
of
this
suit,
and
any
doctrine
laid
down
in
it,
cannot
operate
to
the
benefit
of
any
private
contractor.
the
actual
money
involved
in
these
cases
is
small
because
they
were
confined
to
two
single
months,
one
for
contractor,
as
you
will
imagine
the
total
amount
of
money
involved
is
enormous.
we
estimate
that
there
is
about
$10,000,000
in
back
taxes
and
this
would
operate
in
tennessee
in
the
future
and
undoubtedly,
in
other
states
where
the
aec
is
involved
in
similar
operation.
the
best
of
my
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes,
that
was
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
so
i
confess,
i
don't
see
why
the
arguments
made
here
shouldn't
be
made
in
terms
of
an
annual
tax
on
the
use
of
the
old
plant.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
unable
to
distinguish
that
case
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
if
they're
contention
is
out.
mr.
archibald
cox
just
from
these
enormous
procurements,
that's
right.
the
other
thing
i
was
about
to
say
in
order
to
complete
the
practical
picture
is
that
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
this
method
of
contracting
is
confined
to
the
atomic
energy
commission
but
this
would
not
--
does
not
affect,
one
way
or
the
other,
government
procurements.
now,
i
say
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
there
may
be
a
few
exceptions
but
that's
the
information
i
have
been
able
to
get.
the
court
below
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
may
--
it
--
it
maybe,
mr.
justice
and
i
hadn't
thought
of
--
in
that
sense
but
i'm
glad
i
put
in
the
qualification.
it
does
not
--
i
do
know
that
in
general,
it
does
not
affect
the
defense
department,
i
suppose
and
others
like
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
these
are
materials
not
--
you're
speaking
of
the
atomic
materials,
you
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--say.
these
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
are
materials
not
embraced
by
the
proviso.
furthermore,
in
order
to
be
absolutely
accurate,
these
are
also
materials
which
had
--
these
does
not
include
materials
that
the
government
had
been
using
it
some
prior
atomic
energy
facility
and
transferred
to
oak
ridge.
the
administrative
authorities
in
tennessee
have
said
they
won't
tax
that
but
this
does
involve
all
new
procurements
where
the
title
has
taken
in
oak
ridge
or
whether
directly
by
the
united
states
which
is
the
larger
part
of
it
or
by
the
contractors
as
agents
for
the
united
states
which
is
also
a
very
large
amount.
mr.
archibald
cox
except
--
well,
i
--
in
general,
i
accept
that
but
there
is
one
point
toward
the
end
of
my
argument
that
may
not
be
consistent,
mr.
justice,
with
an
unqualified
answer.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
this
is
said
to
be
a
tax
on
the
privilege
or
rendering
services
admitting
that
the
united
states
gets
the
beneficial
use
of
the
property,
then
i
would
say
it
was
discriminatory
and
be
invalid
for
that
reason.
now,
i
can
elaborate
that
better
as
we
go
along.
but
it
--
the
privilege
or
rendering
services
is
not
generally
taxed
in
tennessee,
that's
the
gist.
the
court
below
held
that
the
sales
tax
could
not
constitutionally
be
levied
on
these
sales
because
there
were
sales
to
the
united
states
with
carbide
and
ferguson
acting
as
agents
and
it
judge
that
kern-limerick
against
scurlock
was
decisive.
the
court
sustained
the
use
tax
upon
the
ground
that
carbide
and
ferguson
had
sufficient
discretion
to
be
independent
contractors.
in
other
words,
if
the
court
assumed
explicitly
that
the
decisive
question
was
the
question
of
agent
versus
independent
contractor
and
then
making
control
or
discretion
on
this
old
test,
it
said
that
carbide
and
ferguson
have
enough
discretion
to
be
independent
contractors
from
which
it
assumed
it
followed
that
the
tax
would
do.
i
think
the
issue
here,
in
view
of
the
precedents,
can
be
very
quickly
narrowed
to
small
companies.
a
state
may
not
collect,
even
from
a
third
person,
a
tax
upon
the
property
or
activities
of
the
united
states.
a
tax
upon
the
united
states
use
of
its
own
property
is
clearly
invalid.
i
think
tennessee
could
see
this
one.
but
second,
we
must
concede
on
our
side
that
the
state
may
tax
a
private
person
for
the
privilege
of
using
government-owned
property
in
the
taxpayer's
business
for
the
taxpayer's
advantage.
so
that
it's
the
taxpayer
that
enjoys
the
fruits
of
the
use,
that's
united
states
against
city
of
detroit
and
the
companion
cases
in
355
unites
states
and
we
have
no
power
with
them.thus,
as
we
see
it,
the
real
question
here
is,
did
the
united
states,
on
the
one
hand,
or
carbide
and
ferguson
enjoy
the
beneficial
use
of
this
property?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it's
--
it's
--
here,
we
would
say
that
any
beneficial
use
that
carbide
or
ferguson
get
is
so
small.
it's
like
the
beneficial
use
i
get
at
the
library
of
the
solicitor
general.
it's
so
small
that
that
is
really
a
tax
on
the
property
around
the
use
of
the
property
by
the
united
states.
now,
i
suppose
some
of
the
benefits,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
are
always
divided.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no,
they
get
paid.
of
course,
any
servant
gets
paid.
and
i
will
have
to
argue
later,
so
i
didn't
suppose
there
was
any
real
question
about
it
that
a
state
could
not
tax
the
chauffer
of
the
president's
limousine
for
the
value
of
the
car
or
the
captain
of
air
force
one,
for
the
value
of
air
force
one
or
the
solicitor
general
for
the
value
of
the
library.
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
but
the
tax
is
not
on
the
privilege
of
employing
employees.
mr.
archibald
cox
first,
i
would
say
that
whether
carbide
is
a
servant
or
not
and
the
element
of
control,
in
that
sense,
element
of
discretion,
is
utterly
irrelevant.
i
think
that
is
our
first
quarrel
with
the
opinion
below.
second,
we
say
that
the
question,
the
true
test,
is
to
be
asking
in
whose
enterprise
is
the
property
use?
who
stands
to
profit
or
lose
from
--
in
the
--
in
the
sense
of
an
entrepreneur,
not
of
a
salary
first,
from
the
use
of
the
property?
who,
in
other
words,
enjoys
the
fruits
of
the
enterprise
and
therefore
of
the
use
to
which
the
property
is
devoted?
and
we
say
that
judged
by
that
test,
neither
carbide
nor
ferguson
enjoyed
the
beneficial
use
of
the
property
in
present.
now,
if
time
forbids
and
it's
going
very
rapidly,
mr.
kramer,
who's
associated
with
the
government
in
this
case,
will
deal
with
the
matter
of
control
or
service.
but
so
far
as
my
argument
goes,
it
is
that
that
element,
on
this
fact,
is
quite
beside
the
point.
i
think
the
best
way
to
get
at
the
proposition
that
neither
carbide
nor
ferguson
enjoyed
the
beneficial
use
of
this
property,
so
as
to
make
it
taxable
to
them,
is
by
comparing
united
states
against
city
of
detroit
and
the
companion
cases
with
the
facts
of
the
present
case.
you
will
recall
it
in
the
city
of
detroit,
the
united
states
owned
industrial
properties
in
detroit
and
leased
it
to
borg-warner,
a
private
manufacturing
business,
for
use
in
the
conduct
of
its
manufacturing
business.
the
michigan
statute
provided
that
where
exempt
property
is
leased,
loaned
or
otherwise
made
available
to
and
used
by
a
private
person
in
connection
with
the
business
conducted
for
profit,
then
the
user,
the
lessee
should
pay
a
tax
as
if
he
were
the
owner.
it
was
held
that
that
tax
was
constitutional
because
borg-warner
was
using
the
plant,
in
the
phrase
in
the
case,
for
its
own
beneficial
personal
use
and
advantage
and
this
was
contrasting
where
they
tax
on
government
property.
the
facts
of
the
case
make
entirely
clear,
if
there's
any
doubt
about
it,
the
meaning
of
that
phrase
for
its
own
beneficial
personal
use
and
advantage.
borg-warner
was
free
to
use
the
property
substantially
as
it
wish.
it
was
free
to
carry
on
what
business
there
it
wanted
to
decide
what
levels
of
production,
what
it
would
make,
what
it
would
sell
for
and
so
forth.
borg-warner,
in
other
words,
suffered
the
profits
--
suffered
the
losses
and
obtained
profit.
under
those
circumstances,
to
have
said
that
the
technical
united
states
ownership
of
the
fee
or
of
the
reversion
exempted
this
property
from
taxation
would
give
borg-warner,
what
the
court
pointed
out,
was
an
unjustifiable
advantage
because
the
use
of
exempt
property,
in
the
court's
words,
is
worth
as
much
as
use
of
comparable
tax
property
during
the
same
interval.
if
there
were
no
tax
on
the
properties,
i
say
and
as
the
court
pointed
out,
it
might
well
give
borg-warner
a
distinct
economic
preference,
as
the
court
said,
over
the
neighboring
competitors
as
well
as
escaping
their
fair
share
of
the
local
tax
responsibility.
now,
this
case,
i
submit,
is
really
quite
indisputably
at
the
other
end
of
the
scale.
there's
no
question
here
of
a
private
business
getting
the
benefit
as
an
entrepreneur
from
the
use
of
this
tax-free
property.
tennessee
isn't
taxing
a
property
that
is
used
for
any
private
advantage
in
the
sense
that
it
wasn't
borg-warner.
indeed,
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
trying
to
raise
money
out
of
the
activities
of
the
united
states.
when
you
go
through
the
contract
in
more
detail,
more
detail
than
we
have
an
opportunity
to
do
now,
i
think
this
will
become
wholly
clear.
but
i
would
like
to
take
a
minute
just
to
point
out
five
particular
points.
the
contract
--
the
carbide
contract
begins
on
page
428.
you'll
see
that
the
undertaking
of
the
corporation,
at
the
very
bottom
of
428,
is
to
manage,
operate
and
maintain
said
plants
and
facilities
and
to
perform
said
work
and
services
upon
the
terms
of
conditions
and
in
accordance
with
the
directions
and
instructions,
not
inconsistent
with
this
contract,
which
the
commission
may
deem
necessary
or
give
to
the
corporation
from
time
to
time
then
the
specific
plants
that
carbide
will
deal
wether
mentioned,
there
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
page
and
speaking
of
the
k-25
plant.
the
corporation
shall
manage,
operate
and
maintain
the
k-25
plant
in
plant
c
in
accordance
with
programs
that
prove
in
rating
from
time
to
time
by
the
commission
to
produce
product
k-25
in
the
amount
and
that
the
rate
required
by
schedules
to
be
provided
by
the
commission.
there
is
no
obligation
to
produce
or
to
sell
anything,
as
i
said
before.
the
obligation
is
on
the
part
of
carbide
to
use
its
best
efforts
and
that
is
clearly
set
forth
in
article
9
over
on
page
450.
second,
i
would
emphasize
that
all
the
proofs
of
the
enterprise,
except
the
benefit
of
getting
experience
in
rendering
services,
belong
to
the
united
states.
that's
true,
not
only
have
the
main
province
but
it's
through
of
incidental
thing.
for
example,
all
sketches,
descriptions,
notebooks
on
experiments,
all
kinds
of
papers
and
books
of
accounts
and
other
proof,
all
belong
to
the
unites
states
from
beginning
to
end
and
remain,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
united
states
if
at
any
times
carbide
leaves
the
facilities.
again,
all
inventions,
discoveries,
any
right
to
patent
or
any
patents
that
are
taken
out,
all
go
to
the
united
states.
so
i
think
it's
literally
true
to
say
that
except
for
the
experience
that
results
from
the
use
of
the
property,
all
the
proofs
go
to
the
united
states.
i
pointed
out
in
stating
the
facts
that
carbide
cannot
gain
or
lose
appreciably
even
by
its
own
skill
or
ineptness
in
carrying
out
contract.
all
expenses,
losses,
all
risks,
all
liabilities
are
born
by
the
united
states
under
article
11
of
the
contract.
and
i
emphasized
again
that
in
the
most
literal
sense,
carbide
has
no
money
or
property
invested
here,
saved
a
few
automobiles.
and
finally,
carbide
must
not
only
do
the
work
as
scheduled
by
the
united
states
but
it
must
do
it
under
such
directions
and
instructions
as
the
atomic
energy
commission
may
have
given.
we
realize
--
first,
let
me
say
that
this
case,
appears
to
us
to
be
as
radically
different
from
the
city
of
detroit
case
in
terms
of
use
or
benefit
as
any
two
cases
could
be.
and
second,
that
it
comes
squarely
within
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
court
involving
a
similar
operation
at
savannah
river
in
south
carolina
which
was
affirmed
by
this
court
in
united
states
against
livingston.
now,
i
realized
that
some
of
the
companion
cases
with
the
city
of
detroit,
it
involved
less
opportunity
for
entrepreneurial
gain,
probably
the
borg-warner
had
in
the
city
of
detroit
case
because
they
involved
contracts
with
the
government
and
in
one
instance,
a
cost-plus
contract
with
the
government.
but
the
court
made
it
very
clear
that
the
reason
the
tax
was
constitutional
was
that
you
couldn't
distinguish
a
business
conducted
from
--
for
private
profits
that's
sold
to
the
government
from
any
other
business
conducted
for
private
proper
--
property.
and
that
the
basis
for
the
tax
was
that
the
individual
enterprise
had
the
right
to
use
the
property
in
the
course
of
its
own
business.
ferguson's
situation,
we
submit,
is
essentially
the
same.
it
is
a
little
harder
to
distinguish
from
an
ordinary
government
construction
contract
than
carbide's
arrangement
is
from
the
ordinary
government
procurement
contract
of
the
supplies
or
goods
because,
of
course,
a
larger
part
of
what
a
contractor
--
construction
contractor
does
is
render
services.
but
if
one
asked
the
essential
question,
has
ferguson
agreed
to
build
a
building,
which
is
what
the
contractor
does?
or
has
ferguson
--
any
opportunities
for
gain
or
loss,
anything
invested
here?
then
i
think
that
it
becomes
clear
that
it
falls
on
the
same
side
of
the
line
too.
it
would
seem
to
us
that
the
futility,
really,
of
the
claim
that
carbide
or
ferguson
upholds
any
government
property
for
its
own
use
and
advantage,
is
revealed
by
the
appellee's
own
arguments.
now,
the
first
thing
appellee
says
is
that
carbide
has
the
beneficial
use
of
this
property
because
it
enables
it
to
sell
its
products
made
at
the
other
plant
to
the
united
states
for
use
at
oak
ridge.
now,
first,
i
think
i
can
say
without
fear
of
contradiction
that
there's
not
a
shred
of
evidence
to
support
the
insinuation
that
carbide
somehow
is
getting
an
advantage
over
other
contractors
in
selling
chemicals
and
such
supplies
to
the
united
states.
indeed,
although
i
regret
the
record
doesn't
show
it,
this
procurement
from
carbide
is
by
direct
procurement,
usually
on
a
competitive
bid.
the
situation
is
no
different
than
what
it
would
be
if
general
electric
or
du
pont
were
running
the
oak
ridge
facility.
and
in
any
event,
certainly,
the
profit
from
the
sales
to
the
oak
ridge
facility
is
no
part
of
the
beneficial
use
of
the
property
employed
at
oak
ridge.
second,
the
appellee
say,
“well,
the
experience
in
using
this
property
gives
valuable
training
to
carbide's
employees
and
officials,”
and
then
when
they're
taken
from
oak
ridge
to
other
parts
of
the
carbide
business,
that
is
a
benefit
to
carbide.
well,
of
course,
the
experience
is
valuable
but
the
experience
gained
in
rendering
services,
we
submit,
cannot
be
called
the
beneficial
use
of
the
property.
for
example,
if
i
were
at
a
private
practice,
i
would
consider
it
--
of
use
to
my
firm
to
send
a
young
man
to
work
in
the
office
of
the
solicitor
general
and
to
some
other
solicitor
general
for
a
period
of
two
or
three
years
and
when
he
came
back
to
my
firm,
i
would
think
my
firm
would
be
to
better
off.
but
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be
said
that
my
firm
has
the
benefits
of
the
use
of
the
department
of
justice
library
or
of
the
desk
or
typewriters
that
he
uses
or
of
books
or
papers
or
anything
else.similarly,
it's
argued
here
that
carbide
receives
compensation,
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
suggested
that
they
weren't
engaged
in
this
as
a
--
out
of
share
altruism.
in
that
respect,
mr.
justice,
i
suggest
that
what
carbide
does
is
just
like
any
employee
or
official
does.
he
expects
to
get
compensated
for
his
services
and
carbide
expects
to
get
compensated
for
its
services.
now,
if
they
said
that
carbide
has
relatively
greater
discretion.
in
the
first
place,
i
would
question
whether
that
was
true
if
i
can
continue
to
be
egocentric,
i
suspect
that
i
have
more
discretion
in
relation
to
the
use
of
the
justice
department
library
or
the
conduct
of
government
litigation
in
this
court
than
carbide
has
in
relation
to
the
performance
at
oak
ridge.
but
the
real
point
is
that
the
item
of
control
which
seemed
to
be
irrelevant
because
there
is
no
rational
connection
between
the
element
of
control
and
the
automatic
imposition
of
the
tax.
this
isn't
tax
on
the
exercise
of
discretion
in
performing
services
for
the
government.
this
purports
to
be
a
tax
related
to
the
benefits
of
property
and
carbide
gets
neither
greater
nor
less
benefit
from
the
property
in
the
sense
of
an
entrepreneur
whether
it
has
wide
discretion
or
some
discretion,
but
not
a
great
deal,
or
no
discretion
at
all.
it
has
its
widest
discretion
in
fact
in
the
area
that
mr.
justice
goldberg
mentioned
earlier
in
the
direction
of
the
employment
of
the
workforces
and
its
lease
discretion,
probably,
in
the
use
of
the
property
and
in
the
scheduling
of
production.
but
in
either
event,
it
has
no
interest
in
the
fruits
of
the
enterprise
and
it
has
no
investment
in
the
enterprise.
and
i
submit
that
the
mere
element
of
control
is
not
something
that
tennessee
can
tax
or
has
really
purported
to
tax.
now,
it
would
seem
to
us
that
that
is
really
the
end
of
the
case.
but
i
suppose
that
in
the
exact
analysis,
there
is
one
question
left,
that
if
one
agrees,
as
i
think
one
must,
that
carbide
has
no
beneficial
use
in
any
other
sense
than
a
government
servant
or
employee
or
official,
a
post
master,
a
lawyer
or
a
chauffeur
or
a
computer
operation
or
a
laboratory
technician,
then,
i
suppose,
it
might
be
said,
strictly
--
well,
can't
the
state
--
says
to
tax
upon
the
privilege
of
rendering
services
to
the
government
and
at
the
government
enterprises
measured
by
the
value
of
the
government
property
utilized
in
rendering
the
services
so
that
the
president
chauffeur
would
be
taxed
on
the
value
of
the
limousine,
the
laboratory
scientist
would
be
taxed
on
the
value
of
the
equipment
and
supplies
he
uses,
the
man
who
digs
with
a
shovel
would
pay
a
tax
on
the
shovel
and
the
one
who
digs
with
a
$50,000
crane
would
pay
a
tax
on
the
crane.
but
first,
we
say,
that
this
is
simply
not
such
a
tax.
it
doesn't
purport
to
be
that
kind
of
a
tax.
at
such
a
tax
as
that
would
be
so
arbitrary
and
capricious
in
its
incidence
because
i
think
my
illustration
show
that
one,
there'd
be
no
relation
to
anything
gained
by
the
employee
or
enjoined
by
the
employee
and
the
tax
that
he
was
required
to
pay.
that
very
arbitrariness
suggests
to
me
that
that
isn't
what
tennessee
is
trying
to
do
that
they
are
trying
to
tax
the
beneficial
use
of
the
property.
and
we
say
that
here,
the
benefits
go
so
exclusively
to
the
united
states
that
this
is
a
tax
on
federal
government
activities.
but
if
this
does
purport
to
be
such
a
tax,
we
would
say
that
it
is
unconstitutional
for
two
reasons
or
really,
because
one
reason
or
the
other
must
be
applicable
and
here,
i
come
to
the
point
about
discrimination.
in
the
first
place,
we
would
say
that
such
a
tax
on
what
was
called
the
privilege
of
rendering
services
to
the
united
states,
measured
by
the
value
of
the
property
that
you
put
--
utilized
in
rendering
the
services,
is
really
a
tax
on
the
united
states
and
that
no
emphasis
upon
form
or
rather
than
substance
could
blind
anyone
to
that
point,
the
measures
took
place.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
be
said
that
the
form
must
be
decisive
that
we
cannot
go
beyond
saying
that
this
is
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
rendering
services
for
the
united
states,
then
we
say
that
it's
discriminatory
because
as
it
operates,
no
one
is
made
to
pay
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
rendering
services
to
anybody
else.
the
sales
or
use
tax
would
be
collected,
it
virtually
--
all
other
cases.
now,
i
don't
think
it
can
be
said
that
this
is
an
effort
to
equalize
taxation
without
falling
back
on
the
other
harm
of
the
dilemma,
then
it
is
really
an
effort
to
tax
tax-exempt
property
or
tax-exempt
activities.
and
consequently,
we
say,
if
the
tax
must
be
viewed
in
this
artificial
light,
then
it
is
unconstitutional
as
being
either
discriminatory
or
really
a
tax
upon
the
united
states
enjoinment
of
its
property.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
in
those
cases,
if
he
bought
ticket
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
in
those
cases,
if
he
bought
the
materials,
he
would
already
have
paid
the
sales
tax
on
them.
if
this
would
bear
only
in
the
case
where
the
sales
tax
couldn't
be
collected
because
it
was
government
tax-exempt
property,
which
i
say
in
effect
is
just
the
same
as
taxing
only
the
government
or
only
the
rendering
of
services.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
so
that
in
its
actual
operation,
the
only
place
this
would
bear
is
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
rendering
services
would
be
services
to
a
--
tax-exempt
persons
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
for
the
government.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
and
it
doesn't
apply
to
churches.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
even
more
precise
than
that.
i
would
like
to
give
a
few
minutes
to
mr.
kramer
and
then
save
the
rest
of
our
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
may
i
simply
say
that
there
is
no
claim
that
carbide
or
ferguson
is
free
of
any
other
taxes
on
companies
doing
business
in
tennessee,
both
are
clearly
doing
business
there
under
these
activities
with
the
government
regardless
of
their
other
--
they
would
be
taxable.
now
this
is
a
case
where
i
think,
it's
very
important
to
be
precise
in
our
use
of
words
in
all
with
it
but
there
are
too
many
slippery
words
here
and
i
want
to
try
and
preserve
the
same
meaning
in
hitting
the
high
spots
of
the
government's
argument.
first,
we
do
not
think
that
our
case
turns
on
the
amount
of
control,
the
degree
of
control
that
the
government
has
over
carbide
through
ferguson's
activities.
to
say
the
same
thing
in
other
words,
we
think
it
is
irrelevant
whether
carbide
is
a
servant
or
an
independent
contractor.
our
first
contention
is
that
the
beneficial
use
of
this
property
in
the
sense
that
it
was
that
time
was
used
in
the
city
of
detroit
and
other
michigan
cases
is
wholly
that
of
the
united
states
sort.
to
put
it
as
mr.
justice
harlan
suggested
yesterday
that
all
these
activities
in
which
the
property
is
used
are
the
activities
of
the
united
states.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
everything
that
is
done
here
is
done
with
the
property
of
the
united
states,
at
the
risk
of
the
united
states
and
on
behalf
of
the
united
state.
and
i
would
say
that
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
carbide
is
the
agent,
not
the
servant,
but
the
agent
of
the
united
states
because
everything
it
does,
it
does
for
the
account
of
the
united
states
in
all
liabilities
of
those
of
the
united
states,
nor
profits
of
those
of
the
united
states.
it's
just
as
if
i
inherited
say
a
retail
store
and
i
hired
a
man
or
to
go
down
and
say,
"now,
you
run
that
store.
do
everything
in
my
name.
i
will
supply
all
the
property.
i
will
supply
all
the
operating
expenses.
i'm
not
going
to
butt
in
with
your
running
in.
i
don't
know
anything
about
the
retail
business.
but
that
would
be
comparable
to
this
and
it
would
all
be
done
for
my
account
and
use
and
benefit.
so
that
seems
to
us
that
this
case
is
clearly
distinguishable
from
city
of
detroit
and
the
other
cases
which
emphasized
that
the
--
a
man
couldn't
get
an
exemption
in
carrying
on
his
business
for
his
entrepreneurial
profit,
not
for
a
fee
but
for
his
entrepreneurial
profit
merely
because
the
united
states
had
the
technical
title
to
the
property.
and
i
think
that
if
these
tennessee
cases
that
were
mentioned
here
were
examined,
of
course
i'm
speculating.
one
would
find
that
those
contractors
like
the
contractor
in
king
&
boozer,
have
brought
their
equipment
to
the
job
as
if
they
were
in
a
sense
entrepreneurs
that
they
could
profit
or
could
lose
and
that
they
didn't
simply
received
a
salary
for
performing
services.
then
i
come
to
the
question
which
hasn't
been
decided
except
as
it
was
decided
in
livingston
which
we
think
clearly
governs
this
case.
may
tennessee
levitate
tax
as
mr.
justice
brennan
put
it
earlier,
on
the
privilege
of
rendering
services
measured
by
the
volume
of
the
property
that
you
handle?
in
that
sense,
use
handled
in
rendering
the
services.
because
i
say
use
for
beneficial
use,
this
just
handling,
that's
all
these
people
do
in
this
property.
and
we
say
that
this
isn't
that
kind
of
tax,
that
this
is
a
tax
on
the
beneficial
use,
on
the
activities
and
the
fellow
who
gains
from
it
and
that
that
is
a
tax
on
the
united
states.
now,
an
effort
was
made
to
compare
this
case
yesterday
to
so
--
standard
oil
company
case
which
you
will
recall
was
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
storing
gasoline.
but
that
wasn't
privilege
tax.
that
was
measured
by
the
volume
of
the
gasoline's
store
and
it
didn't
matter
whose
gasoline
was
stored.
it
was
the
gasoline
of
anybody
including
the
government
that
quite
properly
it
was
held
to
be
taxable.
to
make
that
case
comparable
to
this
one,
one
would
have
to
suppose
that
a
tax
were
levied
on
a
privilege
of
storing
gasoline
of
where
we
can't
reach
the
buyer
or
the
seller
to
collect
the
sales
tax.
and
only,
where
one
couldn't
reach
the
buyer
or
seller
to
collect
the
sales
tax.
well
in
that
event,
it
really
isn't
on
the
privilege
of
the
storing.
it's
an
effort
to
substitute
for
the
sales
tax
which
is
tax
exempt
or
for
the
genuine
use
tax,
which
is
tax
exempt
or
if
i
can
put
this
one
other
illustration.
this
seems
to
me
to
be
comparable
to
saying
that
we're
going
to
lay
attack
on
the
privilege
of
occupying
property
as
the
man,
“as
i
occupy
my
office
if
the
court
occupies
its
chamber.”
we're
going
to
lay
the
tax
and
the
privilege
of
occupying
property
but
we
will
give
credit.
we
won't
collect
it
at
any
case
where
somebody
has
paid
a
real
estate
tax
on
the
ownership
for
the
use
of
the
property.
well
again,
that's
simply
comes
down
to
an
attempt
to
collect
the
real
property
tax
from
the
fellow
who
happens
to
be
there
knowing
that
he
will
have
to
pass
it
under
the
tax
exempt
owner.
it's
a
tax
on
the
property.
well
now
here,
it's
a
tax
on
the
use
we
submit
by
the
united
states
that
i
think
is
a
--
just
the
right
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
the
sole
effect
of
that
appeal
was
to
put
the
atomic
energy
commission
on
the
same
basis
as
every
other
government
agency
to
leave
us
free
to
make
the
arguments
that
we
have
made
here
or
--
and
to
free
the
state
of
tennessee
of
the
arguments
that
the
court
made
in
ron
anderson,
holding
that
it
couldn't
tax.
now,
i
ought
to
in
candor
say
that
i
have
not
made
a
quick
(inaudible)
check.
as
i
understand
it,
we
would
claim
that
the
tax
situation
is
exactly
the
same
as
it
was
under
that
statute
and
that
what
commissioner
strauss
said
was
what
the
government
officials
often
do
when
they
don't
want
to
lose
an
advantage.
they
argue
it
trying
to
do
all
kinds
of
terrible
things.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
the
intention
--
the
intention
was
to
remove
the
statute
and
treat
the
aec
just
like
all
other
agencies.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
there's
apparently
some
doubt
about
that
justice
stewart.
i
would
have
thought
that
it
did
too
and
perhaps
it
did
and
i'll
be
glad
to
get
more
accurate
information
from
the
commission
but
consulting
quickly
with
mr.
kramer,
i
must
say
that
he
tells
me
that
he
thinks
that
we
would
claim
that
the
constitutional
exemption
was
the
same
as
the
exemptions
that
were
claimed
under
the
statute.
but
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
there
must
have
been
many,
many
people
in
congress
who
voted
for
the
appeal
on
the
theory
that
this
agency
should
be
like
other
agencies.
however,
the
chips
might
fall
rather
than
vote
it
to
subject
these
operations
to
pass.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
suppose
mr.
justice
white
that
congress
can
waive
the
constitutional
immunity.
that's
my
recollection
of
the
language
in
some
of
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
clearly
the
only
thing
that
was
intended.
mr.
archibald
cox
quite
right.
and
i
suppose
they
may
have
some
of
each.
i
guess
the
tennessee
representatives
thought
that
they
were
helping
tennessee.
mr.
archibald
cox
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
some
may
have,
others
may
not
and
others
may
have
--
i
think
the
majority
probably
felt,
"well,
let's
let
them
be
like
everybody
else
and
the
chips
will
fall
where
they
do."
