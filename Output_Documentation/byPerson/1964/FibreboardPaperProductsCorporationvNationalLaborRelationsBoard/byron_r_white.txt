but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
labor
group?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
that
a
straight
definition
of
wages,
hours
and
working
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
i
--
a
straight
definition
of
the
word
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
whatever
the
source
of
the
words
or
whatever
the
act
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
whatever
the
words
were
in
the
norris-laguardia
act,
the
court
held
that
the
labor
group
that
contracting
out
was
within
those
words.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
contract,
it
was
a
--
not
contracting
out,
it
was
just
contracting
work.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
plant
doesn't
the
--
isn't
it
clear
from
town
&
country
that
the
board
would
have
issued
the
same
kind
of
an
order
in
that
case
because
that's
been
the
only
unfair
labor
practice
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
town
&
country
--
town
&
country
is
really
the
source
of
the
decision
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
depends
on
what
you
called
a
dictum,
the
8
(a)
(3)
case
or
the
8
(a)
(5)
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
they
had
two
grounds
with
the
reem
--
for
the
resumption
--
for
the
reinstatement
in
the
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
town
&
country
may
use
both
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
8
(a)
(5)
and
8
(a)
(3).
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
what
good
would
a
simple
order
to
bargain
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
who
the
order
--
who
the
company
bargains,
assume
that's
all
that
had
happened
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
local
is
gone
now,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
the
local
--
what
was
the
local,
several
companies
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
just
didn't
happen
to
have
any
employees
in
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
mergers
for
the
--
and
the
mergers
were
--
it
involves
a
(inaudible)
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
suppose
if
the
principle
would
apply,
if
it
--
it
involved
termination
of
tenure.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
suppose
you'll
come
in
upon
the
--
what
the
impact
of
a
holding
in
your
favor
would
have
upon
all
those
cases
in
which
there
is
a
provision
of
the
contractors?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
on
--
well,
certainly,
it
would
on
the
cases
that
didn't
have
the
provision
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
a
contract
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that's
the
--
the
contract
out
of
your
duties
so
to
speak,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
in
this
particular
case,
however,
where
the
contract
of
silence,
that
if
--
that
the
last
--
at
the
time
of
the
last
contracting,
the
union
has
wanted
to
negotiate
a
clause
covering
subcontracting,
and
the
employer
objected,
(inaudible),
and
finally
they
signed
up
a
contract
of
silence.
but
this
case
would
still
--
if
it's
decided
in
your
favor,
it
would
still
require
the
employer
to
bargain?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
kind
of
case
is
not
exactly
the
kind
of
case
we
have
before
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
