mr.
marion
b.
plant
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
certiorari
was
granted
on
two
questions
which
were
set
forth
in
the
petition
as
follows:
one,
was
petitioner
required
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
bargain
with
a
union
representing
some
of
its
employees
about
whether
to
let
to
an
independent
contractor
for
legitimate
business
reasons,
the
performance
of
certain
operations
in
which
those
employees
had
been
engaged.
two,
was
the
board
in
a
case
involving
only
a
refusal
to
bargain
empowered
to
order
the
resumption
of
operations
which
had
been
discontinued
for
legitimate
business
reasons
and
reinstatement
with
back
pay
of
the
individuals
formally
employed
therein.
the
petitioner
is
fibreboard
paper
products
corporation,
and
to
avoid
myself
getting
mixed
up
between
petitioner
and
respondent,
i
will,
if
it
please
the
court,
refer
to
the
petitioner
as
fibreboard.
fibreboard
owns
or
did
own
in
1959
a
number
of
manufacturing
plants
on
the
pacific
coast
and
in
some
offshore
states.
one
of
those
plants
was
located
at
emeryville,
california.
there
were
13
unions
in
the
plant.
five
of
them
represented
one
or
another
unit
of
maintenance
workers.
the
largest
unit
of
maintenance
workers
was
represented
by
a
local
of
the
steel
workers,
which
is
the
union
involved
in
this
case.
for
some
years,
fibreboard
had
been
concerned
about
the
high
cost
of
its
maintenance
work,
the
work
of
maintaining
that
plant.
in
1957
and
again
in
1958,
it
had
sought
to
persuade
the
union
to
modify
its
wage
and
other
contract
demands,
so
as
to
permit
fibreboard
to
operate
and
carry
on
these
maintenance
operations
at
the
cost
which
would
not
be
too
high.
those
efforts
had
been
unsuccessful.
thereafter,
it
commenced
a
study
of
the
possibility
of
affecting
savings
and
costs
by
letting
this
work
to
an
independent
contractor
specializing
in
plant
maintenance.
the
collective
bargaining
contract
which
was
in
effect
in
1959
and
by
the
way,
fibreboard
had
had
collective
bargaining
contractual
relationships
with
its
union
for
22
years,
the
current
contract
was
to
--
expired
or
at
least
the
termination
date
was
on
july
31st,
1959.
the
required
60
days
before
that
date,
the
union
gave
notice
of
desire
to
modify
that
contract
and
shortly
thereafter
served
upon
fibreboard
proposals
involving
changes
in
every
provision
of
the
contract
which
affected
costs,
and
each
of
those
changes
would
have
increased
the
costs.
fibreboard
thereafter
brought
its
study
up
to
date
of
the
question
of
letting
this
work
to
an
independent
contractor
and
decided
to
do
so.
it
reached
that
decision
on
july
27th,
1959.
on
that
date,
it
had
not
yet
decided
who
the
contractor
would
be,
but
it
had
satisfied
itself
by
getting
figures
from
several
and
considering
the
problem
with
several,
that
savings
and
cost
could
be
affected
by
that
means.
immediately
and
i
mean
within
the
hour,
after
that
decision
was
made,
the
fibreboard
director
of
industrial
relations
called
the
local
and
international
business
agents
of
the
union
and
arranged
a
meeting
with
them
or
a
meeting
with
them
later
that
day.
at
that
meeting
he
handed
them
a
letter
stating
that
fibreboard
had
reached
its
decision
that
in
view
of
the
decision
which
had
been
reached,
fibreboard
considered
that
negotiation
of
a
renewed
contract
would
be
pointless
but
that
nevertheless
fibreboard
would
be
glad
to
discuss
any
questions
the
union
might
have.
during
the
course
of
the
meeting,
the
director,
mr.
tuman
(ph),
told
the
business
agents
that
he
had
in
mind
a
plan
for
severance
pay
which
he
outlined,
they
had
no
comments
upon
that
or
any
suggestions
to
make
with
respect
to
that
question.
the
conversation
on
that
occasion
was
pretty
much
limited
to
assertions
by
the
business
agents
that
fibreboard
couldn't
do
it
and
by
tuman
that
fibreboard
could.
the
business
agents
without
specifying
what
provision
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
they
have
referenced
too,
i
guess
they
didn't
know
their
claim
that
if
fibreboard
did
this
it
would
be
violating
the
national
labor
relations
act.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
meeting,
tuman
was
asked
if
he
would
meet
with
the
union's
negotiating
committee
and
he
said
that
he
would.
that
meeting
was
held
on
july
30.
in
the
meantime
on
july
29th,
the
union
wrote
fibreboard
a
letter
taking
the
position
that
its
contract
have
been
automatically
renewed
subject
only
to
an
obligation
upon
the
part
of
fibreboard
to
bargain
about
all
of
these
contract
changes.
at
the
meeting
of
july
30th
with
the
negotiating
committee,
tuman
took
the
position
that
that
wasn't
so.
he
of
course
repeated
that
fibreboard
had
reached
this
position.
he
explained
the
reasons
for
it,
namely,
the
high
cost
of
the
present
operation
and
again
repeated
that
he
would
be
glad
to
discuss
any
questions
that
the
union
might
have.
in
the
course
of
the
conversation,
he
again
outlined
the
plan
for
severance
pay,
no
objections
were
raised
to
it.
now,
he
did
say
that
he
was
not
there
for
the
purpose
of
negotiating
a
renewed
contract
but
that
because
he
thought
that
would
be
pointless.
he
did
not,
however,
cutoff
discussion
regarding
the
contract.
on
the
contrary,
the
union
certainly
didn't
understand
that.
it
proposed
for
example
that
there
--
and
contained
in
the
renewed
contract
a
provision
to
the
effect
that
a
fibreboard
should
contract
out
work.
the
contractor
should
be
required
to
employ
members
of
the
union.
tuman
said
that
that
wouldn't
be
acceptable
because
he
wouldn't
want
to
tie
a
contractor's
hands.
if
he
were
a
lawyer,
he
probably
would've
added
that
would
be
illegal.
the
union
also
proposed
that
the
question
whether
the
contract
should
be
let
--
be
submitted
to
arbitration.
tuman
replied
that
the
company
would
not
want
to
place
a
business
decision
such
as
that
in
the
hands
of
an
arbitrator.
there
were
some
objection
--
two
occasions
by
members
of
the
union
to
the
shortness
of
the
notice.
this
contract
with
the
independent
contractor
was
to
take
effect
as
of
august
1st.
in
reply
to
that,
tuman
said
that
the
--
if
the
union
wished
to
further
time
to
consider
the
problem,
they
would
entertain
a
proposal
that
the
contracting
be
deferred
in
order
to
give
the
union
that
time.
advantage
was
not
taken
of
that
suggestion.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
for
further
discussion
of
the
problem
of
the
contracting
out
the
work
or
anything
else
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
--
the
union
might
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
--
want
to
talk
about.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
it
might
have
been
involved.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
might
have
been
involved.
i
suppose
if
the
union
had
come
in
with
a
contract
proposal
which
would
have
involved
changes
in
demanding
requirements,
lower
wage
cost,
that
would
have
been
given
very
serious
consideration,
but
the
union
never
saw
fit
to
make
such
a
proposal.
well,
at
midnight,
july
31st
fibreboard
had
a
picket
line
and
thereafter
the
union
filed
the
unfair
labor
practice
charges
which
brought
about
the
present
case.
fibreboard
was
charged
with
a
multitude
of
sins.
one
was
discrimination
against
the
union
alleged
that
it
was
--
purpose
was
discriminatory,
other
charges
embraced
refusal
to
bargain.
the
hearing
was
had
before
the
trial
examiner
in
which
attention
was
focused
mostly
upon
the
question
whether
there
had
been
a
discriminatory
motive.
there
was
also
attention
given
to
the
question
whether
fibreboard
had
refused
to
bargain
about
severance
pay.
the
trial
examiner
rendered
a
report
in
which
he
found
against
the
union
and
general
counsel
on
all
issues
and
recommended
that
the
complaint
be
dismissed.
the
case
then
went
up
in
the
normal
course
to
the
board
itself.
the
board
adopted
the
trial
examiner's
findings
and
dismissed
the
case.
in
the
course
of
its
opinion
however,
it
noted
that
general
counsel
in
his
exceptions
to
the
trial
examiners
had
report
had
complained
that
the
trial
examiner
did
not
pass
upon
an
issue
claimed
to
be
of
primary
importance
in
the
case.
namely,
the
question
whether
fibreboard
was
under
a
duty
to
bargain
about
the
decision
to
let
the
contract,
in
other
words,
about
whether
or
not
it
should
let
the
contract
to
this
independent
contracting.
at
that
time,
there
were
a
long
line
of
board
decisions
which
had
received
a
congressional
approval
as
i
will
demonstrate
a
little
bit
later.
and
there
were
a
number
of
court
decisions
all
based
upon
the
hypothesis
that
there
was
no
duty
to
bargain
about
whether
you
let
a
contract,
whether
you
discontinue
a
business,
whether
you
sell
it.
those
cases
regarded
the
act
as
requiring
and
not
let
you
bargain
about
the
operations
which
are
going
to
carry
on,
but
only
about
the
wages,
hours
and
terms
and
conditions
upon
which
manner
to
be
employed
in
those
operations
upon
which
you
decide.
and
accordingly
they
had
held
that
there
was
no
duty
to
bargain
over
a
question
such
as
this.
however,
shortly
after
that
decision
was
rendered
the
membership
of
the
board
changed.
the
union
and
general
counsel
both
moved
for
reconsideration
and
the
board
after
sitting
on
those
motions
for
a
year
and
a
half
vacated
its
--
no,
that's
not
true
--
modified
its
prior
decision
to
the
extent
of
holding
that
there
was
a
duty
to
bargain
about
whether
or
not
you
can
let
work
to
an
independent
contractor.
now,
there
were
several
peculiarities
about
this.
in
its
first
decision,
the
board
had
said
that
you
were
under
no
such
duty
and
never
considered
or
passed
upon
the
question
whether
fibreboard
had
in
fact
bargained.
in
the
second
decision,
the
board
or
rather
the
panel
of
the
board
likely
assumed
that
the
board
in
its
first
decision
had
held
that
fibreboard
did
not
in
fact
bargained
and
proceeded
to
decide
the
case
on
that
basis.
a
few
months
before
the
second
decision,
there
had
come
before
the
board,
the
town
&
country
manufacturing
company
case.
that
was
a
case
in
which
the
employer
had
contracted
out
work
for
the
purpose
of
frustrating
unionization,
of
avoiding
his
bargaining
obligation
and
he
was
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
this
reason.
the
board
went
out
of
its
way
however
to
say
that
even
if
this
had
not
been
true,
it
considered
that
there
was
a
duty
to
bargain
that
its
first
fibreboard
decision
was
wrong,
and
that
that
the
employer
would
have
been
guilty
of
a
refusal
to
bargain
even
though
there
have
been
no
improper
motivation.
it
based
that
decision
upon
the
ground
that
after
all,
the
decision
to
contract
out
work
has
impact
and
effect
upon
the
employment
in
the
plant.
the
reason
for
that
long
delay
of
year
and
a
half
in
deciding
fibreboard
number
two
was
that
one
of
the
members
of
the
board
had
been
the
regional
director
who
issued
the
complaint
and
was
therefore
disqualified.
the
board
therefore,
those
who
were
qualified
to
participate
were
evenly
divided,
two
to
two.
now,
as
this
court
knows
from
its
own
practice
normally,
what
has
done
in
that
situation
is
to
deny
release
by
an
equally
divided
court.
in
that
case,
it
should've
been
to
deny
relief
by
an
equally
divided
board
but
the
board
didn't
do
that.
the
reason
is
explained
by
the
solicitor
general
in
his
answer
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
as
follows.
both
the
general
counsel
and
the
union
sought
reconsideration.
due
to
changes
in
the
membership
of
the
board
and
the
disqualification
of
one
member
to
participate
in
the
case,
the
agency
was
equally
divided
even
though
a
majority
of
the
board
as
then
constituted
was
of
the
view
that
an
employer
has
an
obligation
to
bargain
about
a
decision
to
contract
out
an
operation.
in
these
circumstances,
the
agency
did
not
abuse
its
discretion
in
postponing
its
decision
on
the
motions
of
reconsideration
and
until
as
a
result
of
another
decision,
the
majority
view
could
be
applied
in
the
case.
in
other
words,
until
the
view
of
a
member
who
was
disqualified
could
be
applied
in
the
case.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
yes.
now,
and
the
board
found
favorable
--
fibreboard
not
only
guilty
of
a
refusal
to
bargain
but
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
act
in
a
case
involving
only
a
refusal
to
bargain,
it
ordered
reinstatement
with
back
pay.
it
ordered
that
fibreboard
resume
performance
of
the
maintenance
operations
which
had
been
discontinued
as
too
costly
and
that
the
individuals
who
had
been
employed
therein
be
reinstated
with
back
pay
to
the
date
of
the
order.
it
didn't
order
back
pay
all
the
way
back
because
they
recognized
that
after
all
fibreboard
had
received
a
pretty
bad
treatment
problem.
now,
as
i
have
said,
there
was
a
long
line
of
board
decisions
to
the
contrary
and
what
the
board
did
in
the
town
&
country
case
and
in
the
present
case
was
simply
to
change
the
law.
the
earliest
decision
and
dealing
with
this
question
of
contracting
was
rendered
in
1941.
it
was
the
case
of
brown
mclaren
manufacturing
company.
in
that
case,
the
company
had
a
contract
with
sears,
roebuck
for
the
performance
of
certain
manufacturing
operations.
it
was
losing
money
on
that
contact,
it
conceived
that
the
reason
that
it
was
losing
money
was
that
its
wage
cost
were
too
high.
it
sought
wage
relief
from
the
union
and
manning
relief,
it
was
unable
to
obtain
it,
and
then
contracted
out
to
another
contractor,
the
sears,
roebuck
work.
now,
in
connection
with
that
aspect
of
the
case,
the
board
said
that
if
there
was
any
duty
to
bargain
about
reduced
wages
as
an
alternative
to
contracting
out,
that
duty
had
been
satisfied.
but
that
wasn't
the
end
of
the
matter.
the
employer
then
proceeded
to
contract
out
other
work
in
the
plant
and
moved
work
to
another
plant
which
it
had
ultimate
--
which
it
ultimately
acquired.
the
union
asked
that
the
employer
bargain
about
this
matter
of
letting
work
to
other
contractors
or
moving
it
out
of
the
plant,
the
employer
denied
doing
it.
some
more
time
went
by,
the
same
request
was
made,
the
employer
still
denied
doing
it.
the
third
time,
it
still
denied
doing
it
but
when
confronted
with
some
facts
by
the
union,
admitted
it,
and
refused
to
discuss
the
matter.
thereafter
on
several
occasions,
the
request
was
made
that
it
bargained
about
removal
of
work
in
the
future
from
the
plant,
the
union
offered
to
talk
about
a
wage
decrease,
the
employer
refused
to
negotiate,
refused
to
discuss
the
matter.
the
board
held
that
in
these
circumstances,
the
employer
was
not
guilty
of
a
refusal
to
bargain.
however,
the
board
do
a
distinction
which
is
significant
in
later
cases
that
said
that
although
it
was
not
guilty
of
a
refusal
to
bargain
about
letting
the
contract,
it
should
have
bargained
with
the
union
upon
the
union's
request
that
employees
be
transferred
to
the
new
plant.
in
other
words,
should
have
bargained
about
their
tenure
of
employment.
now,
counsel
say
that
it
is
doubtful
that
that
case
really
held
that
there
was
no
duty
to
bargain.
now,
if
it
was
equivocal
and
that
maybe,
i
don't
know,
there
certainly
was
nothing
equivocal
about
the
decisions
which
followed.
in
mahoning
mining
company
decided
in
1945,
the
owner
of
three
mines
let
the
operation
of
two
of
them
to
independent
contractors,
did
not
consult
the
union
about
it.
first,
the
union
knew
about
it
was
went
to
negotiate
a
renewed
contract
with
the
employer
and
he
said
that
he
no
longer
operated
those
two
mines,
they
were
operated
by
independent
contractors.
the
trial
examiner
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
employer
should
have
required
the
contractors
to
the
--
adhere
to
the
terms
of
the
bargaining
contract.
the
board
reversed.
now,
there
is
a
case
squarely
presenting
the
question
whether
the
employer
was
bargained
the
--
it
was
required
by
law
to
bargain
about
letting
the
contracts
and
the
board
squarely
decided
that
question.
it
said
that
the
board
has
never
held
that
an
employer
may
not
in
good
faith
without
regard
to
union
organization
of
employees
change
his
business
structure,
sell
or
contract
out
a
portion
of
his
operations
or
make
any
like
change
which
might
affect
the
constituency
of
the
appropriate
unit
without
first
consulting
the
bargaining
representative
of
the
employees
affected
by
the
proposed
business
change.
the
next
case
was
decided
in
1949,
walter
holm
&
company.
there,
the
employer
had
leased
its
truck
to
its
drivers
and
thereafter
entered
into
an
arrangement
under
which
its
former
employee
drivers
were
to
operate
its
trucks
as
independent
contractors.
the
trial
examiner
held
that
the
employer
have
been
guilty
of
a
refusal
to
bargain
in
failing
to
consult
the
union
before
doing
this.
the
board
held
that
it
was
not
guilty
of
such
a
refusal
that
there
was
no
duty
to
consult.
it
equated
the
case
with
the
case
where
a
man
goes
out
of
business
and
said,
“section
8
(a)
(5)
does
not
require
an
employer
to
consult
with
his
employees'
representative
as
a
prerequisite
of
going
out
of
business
for
nondiscriminatory
reasons.
the
next
case
in
1951,
was
celanese
corporation
of
america.
now,
everything
i've
quoted
so
far
has
been
the
board's
own
language.
it's
the
board
itself
talking.
in
the
celanese
case,
the
board
adopted
a
trial
examiner's
report
without
itself
writing
any
real
opinion.
there,
it
was
a
case
in
which
the
employer
had
contracted
out
maintenance
work
and
the
board
adopted
the
trial
examiner's
opinion
in
which
he
said,
“the
company
was
not
required
to
consult
with
the
union
as
the
representative
of
its
employees
before
entering
into
this
contract
anymore
than
if
it
was
going
out
of
business
for
nondiscriminatory
reasons”.
now,
that
is
enough
for
the
quotations.
there
are
more
cases
like
that.
there
was
one
in
1952,
trans
wire
(ph)
&
manufacturing
company
and
there
was
one
in
19
--
another
in
1952,
the
national
gas
company.
and
finally,
there
was
the
original
decision
in
this
case
in
which
the
board
said
that
you
--
the
obligation
to
bargain
is
pretty
broad
but
is
not
so
broad
as
to
require
that
a
employer
bargain
about
what
operations
he's
going
to
engage
in.
now,
during
this
long
period,
there
were
court
decisions,
many
of
them,
bearing
upon
the
subject.
there
was
a
long
line
of
board
decisions
and
court
decisions
which
made
the
questions
whether
there
had
been
a
breach
of
the
duty
to
bargain,
depend
entirely
upon
the
employer's
motivation
that
his
motive
was
to
frustrate
unionization
or
union
organization
to
avoid
his
bargaining
obligation
then
he
was
held
guilty
of
a
refusal
to
bargain.
if
his
motives
were
pure,
if
he
was
motivated
simply
by
legitimate
business
considerations,
then
he
was
held
not
guilty
of
a
refusal
to
bargain.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
and
was
never
disturbed.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
that's
correct.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
it
was
not
disturbed.
the
only
question
considered
in
the
second
case
was
whether
there
was
a
duty
to
bargain.
the
fibreboard's
good
faith
was
not
impugned
after
all,
it
had
been
dealing
with
this
union
for
22
years.
its
motivation
was
purely
good
business.
now,
the
fact
that
this
matter
of
motivation
is
important,
is
illustrated
by
the
cases
that
i
have
just
cited.
one
of
which
cited
in
either
the
board's
or
the
union's
brief,
i
forget
which,
it
was
brown
duncan
company.
there,
the
court
holding
that
there
was
improper
mu
--
motivation
said
that
the
company
may
not
discontinue
a
part
of
an
integrated
operation
merely
because
the
employees
engaged
in
the
particular
work
--
in
the
particular
unit,
seek
union
representation.
in
circumstances
like
these,
(inaudible)
--
motivation
becomes
important,
indeed
decisive.
there
was
another
long
line
of
cases
which
drew
the
distinction
between
bargaining
about
the
decisions
to
let
work
to
a
contractor
or
sell
a
business
or
discontinue
a
business
and
bargaining
about
measures
designed
to
ease
the
impact
of
that
decision
upon
employees
majors
such
as
severance
pay
wages
or
supplying
other
employment,
tenure
of
employment.
they
held
that
there
was
a
duty
to
bargain
about
those
latter
questions.
but
in
those
cases,
again
the
distinction
was
clearly
drawn,
and
for
example,
in
the
case
of
rapid
bindery
inc.
likewise
cited
in
either
the
board
or
the
union's
brief
and
perhaps
both,
the
--
or
after
finding
the
employer
guilty
of
a
refusal
to
bargain
about
transferring
employees
went
on
to
say
this.
and
we
are
also
the
opinion
that
in
as
much
as
the
move,
this
was
the
case
of
moving
operations
from
one
plant
to
another,
we're
also
of
the
opinion
that
in
as
much
as
the
move
was
made
through
a
legitimate
exercise
of
managerial
discretion,
the
issue
of
whether
it
was
the
--
whether
it
was
to
--
whether
it
was
to
be
made
need
not
have
been
submitted
by
respondents
for
discussion
at
the
bargaining
table.
now,
while
all
these
cases
were
being
decided,
the
congress
subjected
the
act
to
two
general
revisions.
the
first
was
the
taft-hartley
act
in
1947.
up
to
that
time,
section
9
(a)
of
the
act
had
contained
a
provision
to
the
effect
the
certified
union
was
to
be
the
exclusive
representative
of
employees
for
the
purpose
of
bargaining
about
rates
of
pay,
wages,
hours
of
employment
or
conditions
of
employment.
and
it
was
under
that
provision
that
the
first
two
of
the
board
cases
that
i
have
referred
to
were
decided.
in
1947,
congress
subjected
the
act
to
a
general
revision
and
in
section
8
(d)
the
new
section
defined
the
duty
to
bargain.
and
in
defining
the
duty
to
bargain,
it
used
substantially
this
same
language
which
had
been
interpreted
by
the
board
in
the
manner
which
i
have
set
forth.
in
1959,
the
act
again
was
subjected
to
a
general
revision.
in
that
interval
there
had
been
four
more
of
these
board
decisions
to
which
i
have
referred.
congress
used
the
same
language
and
apparently
adopted
and
approved
the
interpretation
which
had
been
placed
upon
that
language.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
no.
but
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
now,
let
me
get
that
question
straight.
the
revision
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
board
cases,
no.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
the
nearest
--
the
legislative
debates
or
discussions
came
to
the
subject
matter
was
this.
in
1947,
the
house
bill
contained
a
provision
defining
bargaining
which
was
very
detailed.
it
just
laid
out,
you
do,
one
this,
two
this,
three
this,
four
this,
and
it
was
very
specific
and
the
subjects
which
it
specified
as
subjects
of
bargaining.
congressman
kennedy
and
a
few
others
wrote
a
minority
committee
report
in
which
they
made
a
lot
of
objections
to
this
language,
one
was
that
it
would
eliminate
contracting
from
bargaining.
i
questioned
the
accuracy
that
it
was
eliminated,
never
been
there.
and
they
wrote
a
minority
report.
the
senate
bill
which
as
--
was
finally
enacted,
contained
a
somewhat
broader
language.
i
don't
think
it
had
any
bearing
upon
a
particular
question
for
us
now.
and
that
congressman
kennedy
and
the
others
would
sign
the
minority
report
in
the
house,
voted
against
that
as
well.
now,
i
don't
think
it
proves
anything
and
i
have
placed
no
reliance
upon
legislative
history.
now,
since
the
board's
decision
in
the
town
&
country
case
and
in
this
case,
the
second
decision,
it
has
is
applied
this
doctrine
which
to
develop
in
those
two
cases
to
employer's
decisions
to
ship
by
common
carrier
or
contract
carrier
trucks
rather
than
by
his
own
trucks
to
a
decision
to
go
out
of
business
because
he
was
broke,
to
a
decision
to
sell
three
of
several
stores
that
he
owned,
to
a
decision
to
purchase
a
cheese
product
already
packaged
rather
than
packaging
it
himself,
to
a
decision
to
move
a
certain
operation
from
one
plant
to
another,
and
to
--
well,
that's
enough
i
guess,
there
are
more
but
i
can't
think
of
them
on
hand.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
yes.
yes,
they
are.
now,
the
board
takes
in
its
brief
an
extremely
broad
decision.
it
says
that
you
got
to
bargain
about
any
thing
that
either
party
chooses
to
propose.
let
me
just
quote
a
couple
of
passages.
“thus,
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
to
which
sections
8
(d)
and
9
(a)
referred
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
page
21.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
down
toward
to
the
bottom
of
the
text.
“the
terms
and
conditions
to
which
sections
8
(d)
and
9
(a)
referred
are
any
stipulations
under
which
the
workers
agreed
to
be
employed
and
the
management
to
employ
them,
except
as
other
language
or
the
policy
of
the
act
may
confine
the
meaning,
they
verbally
embraced
any
provision
which
either
party
wishes
to
put
in
the
agreement”.
and
again
over
in
page
23
down
toward
the
bottom.
“they
include
any
stipulation
which
either
party
considers
so
vital
as
they
wish
to
make
it
part
of
the
bargain”.
now,
that
is
the
far
extreme
from
the
one
which
the
gentleman
on
my
right
was
arguing
for
back
in
1948
when
in
the
harvard
law
review,
he
said
that
the
duty
to
bargain
meant
only
that
you
couldn't
bargain
with
individuals.
it
did
not
meant
only
that
if
you
did
any
bargaining.
it
had
to
be
with
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative,
and
didn't
mean
that
you
had
to
bargain
on
any
particular
subject.
the
board
is
now
contending
that
not
that
there
is
no
subject
about
which
bargaining
is
mandatory,
but
that
there
is
no
subject
about
which
bargaining
is
not
mandatory.
now,
that
contention
i
submit
run
squarely
into
the
teeth
if
that's
the
proper
metaphor
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
worcester
division
of
board
warner
company
where
this
court
held
that
not
all
subjects
are
subjects
upon
which
bargaining
is
mandatory.
there
are
some
subjects
upon
which
bargaining
is
not
mandatory
which
is
--
upon
which
bargaining
is
permissible
but
upon
which
it
is
not
required.
now,
the
board's
decision
in
this
case
as
well
as
its
brief
necessarily
mean
that
there
are
no
subjects
upon
which
bargaining
is
required
--
is
not
required
because
there
is
no
subject
which
does
not
have
an
impact
or
effect
upon
wages,
hours,
terms
or
conditions
of
employment.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
i
would
draw
the
line
between
the
question
--
a
question
as
to
the
business
operations
in
which
an
employer
maybe
--
may
engage
and
a
question
as
to
the
wages,
hours,
terms
and
conditions
upon
which
men
are
to
be
employed
in
those
operations
upon
which
he
decides.
i
don't
think
that
the
phrase
wages,
hours,
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
embraces
the
question
whether
an
employer
may
go
out
of
business
because
he's
broke,
may
contract
out
an
operation
because
he
is
losing
money
on
it,
may
move
it
to
another
plant
because
that
is
more
economic.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
well,
the
language
we'd
find
your
honor
is
the
definition
of
the
duty
to
bargain
which
says
that
you
must
bargain
about
wages,
hours
and
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
it
certainly
does
not
say
that
you
must
bargain
about
the
business
operations
what
you're
going
to
carry
on.
i
realize
squarely
on
the
language
of
the
act.
now,
this
is
true
your
honor
between
the
position
which
i
take
and
the
extreme
position
which
the
board
takes,
the
language
of
the
act
permits
of
no
stopping
point.
once
you
start
down
that
path
along
which
the
board
seeks
to
entice
you,
there
is
no
stopping
point
short
of
the
position
which
the
board
here
takes.
and
just
what
does
that
position
mean,
well,
let's
refer
again
to
the
board's
brief.
“it
may
be
objected”
--
and
i'm
quoting
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
on
page
22,
i'm
sorry.
“it
may
be
objected
that
the
literal
reading
would
give
labor
unions
a
statutory
right
to
bargain
about
a
host
of
subjects
heretofore
regarded
as
management
prerogatives
including
prices,
types
of
product,
volume
of
production
and
even
methods
of
financing”.
such
is
doubtless
of
the
logical
theoretical
consequence
of
the
giving
effect
to
the
literal
sweep
of
the
words
although
the
board
has
never
gone
so
far.
now,
that
is
the
path,
that
is
the
point
to
which
this
path
leads
and
i
submit
that
the
taft-hartley
congress
would
have
had
a
conniption
test
if
anyone
had
suggested
to
it
that
this
was
what
it
was
enacting
in
the
law.
now,
there
are
no
decisions
of
this
court
on
this
question,
there
are
decisions
which
depending
upon
your
point
of
view
will
be
cited
as
bearing
this
way
upon
it
or
that
way
upon
it.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
arguably,
it
does
by
way
of
dicta
but
that
question
really
wasn't
involved
in
the
oliver
case.
if
the
court's
decisions
--
if
the
court's
decisions
along
about
that
time
are
still
law,
that
was
a
matter
for
the
board
to
decide.
it
was
sufficient
to
deprive
this
court
of
jurisdiction
that
is
what
it
termed
its
power
to
decide,
that
the
matter
was
arguably
subject
covered
or
protected
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
i'm
sure
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
--
it
touches
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
--
on
it.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
same
thing.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
no.
that
was
a
norris-laguardia
act
case.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
to
this
extent
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
to
this
extent
your
honor,
the
norris-laguardia
act
defines
a
strike
as
a
--
or
a
labor
dispute
is
some
--
is
a
dispute
arising
out
of
terms
or
conditions
of
employment
but
it
goes
on
with
a
lot
more.
in
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
i
don't
think
it
was
contracting
out,
no.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
it
was
a
case
where
the
railroad
was
going
to
eliminate
some
stations.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
and
the
court
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
that's
--
that's
right.
the
court
held
that
that
was
a
strike
going
out
of
a
labor
dispute
within
the
meaning
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
but
bear
this
in
mind,
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
a
remedial
statute
which
way
back
in
(inaudible),
this
court
held
was
to
be
very
liberally
construed.
i
don't
think
it
can
be
equated
with
the
national
labor
relations
act
notwithstanding
some
similarities
in
wording.
now,
this
court
has
touched
upon
this
question
quite
recently
in
wiley
&
brothers
versus
livingston
--
or
wiley
&
sons
versus
livingston.
that
was
the
case
in
which
you
will
recall
there
had
been
a
corporate
merger
and
the
question
was
whether
the
surviving
corporation
was
bound
by
the
provisions
in
the
collective
bargaining
contract
of
the
corporation
which
lost
its
identity.
the
court
held
that
it
was
and
in
the
course
of
its
discussion,
it
said
this,
it
said
that
unions
ordinarily
do
not
take
part
in
negotiations
leading
to
a
change
in
corporate
ownership.
and
it
then
referred
and
i
quotes,
“to
the
rightful
prerogative
of
owners
independently
to
rearrange
their
businesses
and
even
eliminate
themselves
as
employers”.
now,
that
is
the
latest
expression
of
the
court
bearing
upon
this
question.
now,
i've
got
five
minutes
to
get
these
employees
unreinstated.
so,
with
the
court's
permission
i
will
proceed
to
the
second
question.
as
i
have
stated
that
--
this
is
the
first
case
in
the
history
of
the
act
which
in
reinstatement
has
been
ordered
in
the
case
involving
only
a
refusal
to
bargain.
counsel
have
taken
issue
with
me
on
that,
pointing
to
the
unfair
labor
practice
strike
situations
in
which
a
strike
has
been
induced
by
a
refusal
to
bargain
and
in
which
employees
are
ordered
reinstated.
well,
the
theory
of
those
decisions
is
that
by
refusing
to
take
the
striking
workers
back,
the
employer
discriminates
against
them
upon
account
of
their
legitimate
union
activity
and
violates
section
8
(a)
(3)
of
the
act.
and
i
repeat
that
this
is
the
first
case
in
the
history
of
the
act
which
an
employer
has
been
ordered
to
reinstate
employees
in
a
case
involving
only
a
refusal
to
bargain.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
order
violates
section
10
(c)
of
the
act
which
explicitly
deprived
the
board
of
power
to
reinstate
an
employee
terminated
or
discharged
of
cause.
now
cause
doesn't
mean
just
misconduct
that
is
demonstrated
by
the
legislative
history
in
which
senator
taft
explained
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
that
there
were
two
kinds
of
discharge,
discharges
for
union
activity
and
discharges
for
cause.
but
in
the
case
of
a
discharge
for
a
union
activity,
the
board
could
reinstate.
but
in
the
case
of
a
discharge
for
a
cause,
it
could
not,
and
by
cause
it
was
obviously
the
embraced
discharges
for
all
--
any
reason
other
than
union
activity.
and
in
that
connection,
he
said
that
his
--
no
provision
was
merely
setting
forth
what
was
the
existing
law.
and
the
existing
law
had
been
declared
by
this
court
in
at
least
three
cases
to
be
exactly
what
i
have
stated
that
an
employer
cannot
discharge
for
union
activity
or
for
the
purpose
of
coercing
union
members
or
people
who
want
to
be
union
members,
but
it
can
discharge
for
any
other
reason
that
it
wants,
good
or
bad.
now,
my
time
is
short,
those
cases
are
in
my
brief.
we
also
think
that
the
order
that
we
resume
operations
which
have
been
discontinued
because
they
were
too
costly,
reinstate
employees
with
back
pay
and
then
start
bargaining
about
whether
we
can
do
the
same
thing
over.
it
serves
no
purpose
and
disunity.
we
wouldn't
have
a
chance
of
getting
employees
to
quit
their
present
jobs,
to
come
back
to
work
for
us,
at
1959
wage
rates
with
no
assurance
that
three
weeks
later
after
appropriate
bargaining,
we'd
contract
out
the
work
and
they'd
be
out
of
the
job
again.
obviously,
if
we
have
been
guilty
of
a
refusal
to
bargain,
the
remedy
is
a
simple
order
that
we
bargain.
we
have
no
interest
in
discriminating
against
these
people
that
has
been
found,
our
interest
is
in
saving
money.
and
if
they
can
work
out
a
bargain
with
us
that
we'll
save
his
money,
we'd
be
delighted
that
they
come
back.
but
the
bargain
has
to
be
worked
out
first,
both
from
our
stand
point
and
from
theirs,
no
man
is
going
to
leave
his
present
job
to
return
to
fibreboard
unless
he
has
assurance
of
a
bargain
made
in
advance.
now,
my
time
is
up
and
i'm
about
out
of
words.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
yes,
it
went
way
out
of
its
way
to
say
that
and
delay
the
groundwork
for
its
decision
in
this
case
by
the
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
a
dictum
in
town
&
country,
yes
sir.
so,
i
say
it
was
a
dictum
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
no.
the
8
(a)
(5)
order
was
based
primarily
upon
the
ground
that
they
had
contracted
out
the
work
to
avoid
bargaining,
to
avoid
--
mr.
marion
b.
plant
right.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
right.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
and
it
went
out
of
its
way
to
say
even
if
there
hasn't
been
illegal
motivation,
still
we
now
say
--
announced
it
as
the
law,
that
an
employer
has
to
bargain
about
these
things.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
in
this
case?
mr.
marion
b.
plant
we
bargain
with
the
union
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
no.
no,
its
alive
and
kicking.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
oh,
yes
its
--
represents
a
lot
of
employees
in
that
area.
mr.
marion
b.
plant
that's
right.
we
terminated
the
employees
that
they
represented
in
our
plant
along
with
employees
represented
by
other
unions.
they
weren't
alone
in
this,
but
they're
the
only
ones
that
filed
charges.
if
i
would
bargain
with
them,
and
if
they
had
a
good
proposition
to
make,
we'd
certainly
consider
it,
why
not?
thank
you.
