right
up
until
this
case
or
its
immediate
predecessor,
the
court
--
the
board
had
held
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
this?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know
in
your
brief
you
do.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
not
pressing
it
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
mr.
plant
has
told
us
in
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
told
us
in
that
way.
justice
potter

you
mean
it
would
include

justice

stewart
--
the
necessity
to
bargain
about
whether
or
not
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
i
still
don't
quite
see
in
your
etymological
argument
if
i
have
the
right
word.
incidentally,
i
thought
that
it
had
something
to
do
with
insects
but
i
guess
that
--
just
your
verbal
dictionary
argument
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
your
dictionary
verbal

argument.
why
does
terms
and
conditions
employed
here,
issues
as
to
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
necessarily
embrace
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
shall
be
employment
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
shall
be
any
employees
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
me
is
quite
a
separate
one
from
the
issue
of
what
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
employment
shall
be
if
there
are
employees.
justice
potter
stewart
but
all
--
it
was
necessary
to
the
decision
in
that
case,
you
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong,
was
the
holding
that
that
was
a
labor
dispute
within
the
meaning
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
(voice

justice

essential
to
the
decision
of

--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me,
let
me
just
do
a
little
further
in
this
case.
i
think
it's
correct
that
what's
involved
here
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
these
things
are
required
to
be
bargained
about
the
--
this
decision.
this
decision
to
contract
out
rather
than
whether
or
not
there's
permissive
bargaining
about
it?
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
using

as
a
distinction?
justice

(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
justice
potter

reads
to
us?
justice
potter
stewart
read
it
to
us
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
a
little
difficulty
seeing
that
how
cases
which
turned
on
the
meaning
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
requirement
to
arbitrate
or
something
like
that
have
much
bearing
on
the
basic
issue
here
and
that
is
the
duty
to
bargain
in
the
absence
of
any
agreement.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is,
if
one
side
or
the
other
brought
it
up?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
entirely
consistent
with
the
position
they
now
take,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
should
think
your
argument
though
would
in
term
to
bargain
before
they
reduce
any
of
the
machinery.
