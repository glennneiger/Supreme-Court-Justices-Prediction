mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
would
be
well
in
the
beginning
to
go
back
for
a
moment
and
look
at
exactly
what
it
is
that
petitioner
decided
to
do
without
consulting
the
union
in
this
case,
and
exactly
what
it
is
that
it
claims
the
right
to
do
without
bargaining
collectively.
in
practical
terms
as
applied
to
the
employer
and
to
the
employees,
petitioner's
decision
to
contract
out
this
maintenance
work
meant
four
things.
in
the
first
place,
fluor,
a
labor
contractor
was
tech
--
was
intruded
between
petitioner
and
the
men
in
the
plant
who
would
be
doing
the
maintenance
work
and
by
that
i
include
the
work
in
the
power
plant.
now,
the
minor
supervision
would
be
done
by
fluor.
fluor
would
be
technically
the
person
who
hired
and
fired
the
employees
all
subject
to
petitioner's
ultimate
direction.
second,
the
same
work
would
continue
to
be
done,
the
same
labor
in
petitioner's
plant,
according
to
petitioner's
need,
with
petitioner's
tools,
at
petitioner's
expense
that
this
was
a
(inaudible)
contract,
and
subject
to
petitioner's
ultimate
direction.
the
wages,
hours,
and
working
conditions
under
which
the
work
was
done
would
be
changed
so
as
to
reduce
labor
cost
and
out
of
that
reduction
of
labor
cost,
petitioner
would
achieve
according
to
the
estimates
a
very
substantial
saving.
but
i
would
estimate
and
i
would
emphasize
that
according
to
the
offer
that
fluor
made
to
petitioner,
we
may
judge
by
that,
merely
all
the
savings
were
anticipated
to
come
out
of
a
reduction
in
labor
standards.
they
said
i'm
on
--
in
the
proposal
on
page
146
of
the
record,
they
eliminate
most
of
the
fringe
benefits
such
as
travel
times,
subsistence,
vacation
pay,
sick
pay,
termination
pay,
paid
holidays
and
so
forth.
that
they
get
the
right
to
terminate
employees
or
reduce
work
forces
at
any
time,
that
they'd
eliminate
any
work
orders
or
in
the
working
men's
language,
they
had
imposed
his
freedom.
they
get
the
maxim
--
they'd
reduced
high
rate,
they
(inaudible)
--
get
the
right
to
enforce
high
rates
of
production
from
all
maintenance
employees.
again,
a
matter
of
how
much
work
you
do
for
an
hour
and
how
much
work
you
do
for
a
buck.
these
and
other
things
are
the
things
that
they
emphasized
they
would
achieve
and
they
were
certainly
contemplated
to
be
the
source
most
of
the
savings.
then
the
fourth
thing
that
happened
was
that
as
a
result,
70
maintenance
employees
including
all
50
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit
lost
their
jobs
and
new
men
were
brought
in
to
take
their
places.
i
think
its
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
core
of
what
was
done
here
was
the
change
in
the
manner
of
obtaining
labor.
it
substituted
one
group
of
workers
for
another,
it
changed
compensation
and
then
other
changed
working
condition.
and
that
this
is
what
petitioner
claims
a
right
to
do
without
consulting
the
bargaining
representative
and
that
it
--
still
it
asserts,
it
had
the
right
to
do
without
consulting
the
bargaining
representative.
whether
it
had
is
of
course
the
only
legal
question
presented
in
this
case.
i
want
to
say
just
a
word
if
i
may
at
this
point
about
the
scope
of
the
issue
presented.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
might
be
defined
in
anyone
of
three
ways.
first,
it
might
be
confined
to
the
exact
kind
of
contracting
out
that
i
have
just
described,
this
would
cover
almost
any
case
where
workers
were
brought
into
the
same
plant
to
supply
labor
in
that
plant.
and
there,
as
here
i
think,
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
gist
of
the
change
is
in
the
method
of
obtaining
services
that
that's
the
practical
thrust
of
it
whatever
the
legal
characterizations
are.
and
that
would
seem
to
be
all
it
is
necessary
to
dispose
of
the
present
case
for
the
court
to
hold.
now,
our
brief
goes
one
step
farther.
it
argues
that
what
i
have
called
contracting
out
is
a
statutory
subjection
of
collective
bargaining.
and
we
used
the
term
contracting
out
to
cover
not
only
bringing
the
employees
of
a
labor
contractor
into
the
plant,
to
take
men's
jobs
but
also
shipping
work
that
has
normally
been
done
in
the
bargaining
unit
out
of
the
plant
where
it
will
be
done
by
someone
else
and
his
employees.
i
should
point
out
that
there
is
this
difference
where
you're
bringing
men
into
the
plant,
this
weight
of
the
whole
thing
is
on
labor
conditions
alone.
they're
not
exclusively
but
that
is
certainly
the
weight.
and
some
of
the
shipping
of
work
out
of
the
plant
may
involve
in
addition
to
depriving
men
of
the
work
may
involve
problems
of
scheduling,
of
what
tools
you
have
or
what
tools
you
have
available
and
what
capital
you
were
invested
so
forth.
there's
a
bit
more
management
in
it
and
i
think
one
has
to
recognize
that
difference.
now,
there's
a
third
way
one
could
define
the
issue,
and
that
is
to
say
that
the
phrase,
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
covers
anything
that
has
to
do
with
the
elimination
of
jobs,
the
elimination
of
work
that
directly
and
necessarily
affects
tenure
of
employment
or
as
this
court
said
in
the
telegraphers
case,
permanency
of
employment.
and
that
appears
to
be
what
the
board
has
done
in
extending
the
doctrine
of
the
town
&
country
case
to
cover
these
shutting
down
of
plant
or
moving
a
plant
to
another
area.
that
type
of
question
it
seems
to
me
is
a
--
not
necessarily
involved
here
and
we
made
no
argument
in
this
case
with
respect
to
it.
but
i
should
acknowledge
that
the
board
has
carried
it
that
far.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
recall
whether
the
board
has
so
held.
the
case
is
in
our
brief,
i
don't
remember
a
merger
case,
but
i
wouldn't
say
there
wasn't
one
either,
mr.
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
seem
that
if
that
were
made,
the
exclusive
test
that
it
then
would
apply,
yes.
but
i
--
we
don't
have
to
go
merely
that
far
in
this
case.
we
don't
go
merely
that
far
in
this
case.
we
submit
that
this
change
in
the
manner
in
which
petitioner
obtained
labor
is
a
mandatory
subject
of
collective
bargaining
for
three
reasons.
first,
we
say
its
well
within
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words
of
the
statute.
section
8
(d)
on
page
74
of
our
brief
states
the
duty
to
bargain
collectively
is
to
meet
and
confer
in
good
faith
with
respect
to
wages,
hours
and
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
and
section
9
(a)
says
that
the
representative
chosen
by
the
majority
is
the
representative
for
the
purposes
of
bargaining
with
respect
to
rates
of
pay,
wages,
hours
of
employment
or
other
conditions
of
employment.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
ways
confining
myself
now
simply
to
the
entomological
meaning
of
the
words,
the
literal
meaning
of
the
word,
there
are
two
ways
in
which
they
might
be
interpreted.
first,
if
one
looks
it
up
in
the
dictionary,
the
terms
of
a
contract
are
simply
the
provisions
of
the
bargain
and
the
conditions
of
the
contract
are
simply
the
stipulations
prerequisite
to
agreement
or
prerequisite
to
performance
on
your
side
and
prerequisite
to
performance
on
the
other
side.
so
that
literally
the
terms
and
conditions
of
an
employment
contract
are
simply
the
stipulations
on
which
the
workers
agree
to
be
employed
and
that
the
management
agrees
to
appoint.
now,
i
do
not
advance
here
and
i
do
not
think
it
fairly
read,
we
advanced
in
our
brief,
the
proposition
that
the
duty
to
bargain
extends
to
anything.
i
did
point
out
that
under
this
literal
meaning
of
the
words,
it
would
extend
to
anything.
but
we
went
on
and
indicated
that
the
practices
of
industry
and
the
policies
of
the
act
might
produce
a
limitation.
we
most
emphatically
pointed
out
that
the
board
not
only
has
never
adopted
that
view
but
in
cases
cited
in
our
brief
has
rejected
that
view
and
there
are
number
of
things
which
it
is
held
are
not
mandatory
subject
of
collective
bargaining,
not
only
because
they
maybe
contrary
to
policy
of
the
act,
but
also
because
it
thinks
they
aren't
sufficiently
related
to
conditions
of
employment.
one
of
these
is
an
industry
promotion
file.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
a
little
later
mr.
justice
stewart,
we'll
respectfully
disagree.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
as
i
do
here
most
emphatically.
mr.
archibald
cox
so
i
don't
think
it
could
be
said
that
right
up
till
this
case
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
the
board
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
what
mr.
plant
has
told
you.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
omitted
to
mention
the
one
clear
decision
to
the
contrary,
the
case
that
was
cited
by
approval
--
cited
with
approval
by
this
court
in
teamsters
against
oliver's.
the
case
that
was
the
outstanding
decision
at
the
time
the
taft-harley
amendments
were
enacted.
the
timken
roller
bearing
case
which
is
cited
and
quoted
extensively
in
our
brief.
so,
i
really
don't
think
that
the
course
of
decisions
without
quarreling
about
what
other
cases
may
have
held
is
anywhere
near
--
as
clear
as
mr.
plant
says.
he
--
his
argument
founders
on
the
timken
case
so
far
as
it's
an
argument
based
on
consistent
administrative
interpretation
or
on
what
congress
must
have
known
when
it
reenacted
these
provisions
in
the
taft-hartley
act.
but
coming
back,
i've
suggested
one
way
of
reading
the
words.
another
way
of
reading
the
words
is
to
say
that
terms
or
conditions
of
employment
means
--
let's
say
terms
or
conditions
relating
to
the
employment
status
or
relating
to
the
ongoing
relationship
between
employer
and
employee.
and
then
i
suppose
determining
what
they
are
by
considering
where
the
weight
of
the
particular
practice
runs,
how
closely
it
affects
employment.
if
that
be
the
reading
and
for
the
present
purposes,
we
can
perfectly
well
accept
it.
certainly,
employment
includes
such
questions
as
to
whether
men
will
be
employed,
who
will
be
employed,
when
will
that
--
when
they'll
be
laid
off
or
what
causes
they'll
be
laid
off
and
so
forth.
in
other
words,
things
related
to
the
fact
or
tenure
or
permanency
as
this
court
put
it
over
the
employment.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
should
take
that
if
that
alone
were
made
the
test,
it
would
include
the
right
to
go
out
of
business.
i
would
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
they
--
mr.
archibald
cox
they
would
if
you
rested
on
the
literal
meaning
of
the
words
alone.
but
now
speak
--
but
all
i'm
saying
for
the
moment
is
really
two
things
mr.
justice
harlan,
one
is
that
whichever
or
what
seem
to
me
to
be
the
two
possible
etymological
meanings
of
the
words
we're
within
it.
i
don't
say
that's
conclusive,
i
say
we're
within
it.
and
i
even
acknowledge
that
it
extends
--
carries
one
relying
on
the
words
alone,
much
farther
than
we
have
to
go
here.
and
i
think
that's
what
led
mr.
plant
to
say
we
took
a
different
position
than
we
do
take.
because
if
one
then
has
to
look
to
the
policies
of
the
act
and
to
the
practices
in
collective
bargaining,
to
see
what
content
he
will
give
the
dictionary
meaning.
mr.
archibald
cox
one
entomological
and
the
other
is
etymological.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
not
sure
which
is
which.
but
we
don't
--
we're
talking
about
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
(inaudible)
--
it's
--
i
can't
think
of
any
thing
that
is
more
a
term
than
whether
you
will
be
laid
off.
mr.
archibald
cox
nor
can
i
think
of
anything
that
has
been
more
universally
treated
as
a
condition
of
employment
and
is
bargainable.
think
of
all
the
cases
dealing
with
the
close
shop,
the
union
shop,
substitution
of
men
from
machines,
work
assignment,
jurisdictional
disputes,
seniority
and
promotions
and
layoffs,
mandatory
retirement,
all
those
things
--
well,
always
been
regarded
as
bargaining.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
question
of
whether
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
suppose
--
i
would
think
that
the
fact
of
employment
was
the
very
heart
of
the
matter.
i
don't
know
if
i
can
say,
you
know,
anything
more
than
that.
i
think
it
(inaudible)
persuades
a
dozen.
while
i'm
on
the
--
what
i
call
the
etymological
meaning
and
referring
to
the
practices
of
bargaining
about
things
relating
to
tenure
of
employment.
let
me
point
out,
if
there
are
at
least
two
cases
in
which
this
court
has
held
that
employer
practices
rechanging
the
business
methods
that
result
in
the
layoff
of
employees
are
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
one
--
a
case
that
all
of
us
forgot
about
is
united
states
against
american
federation
of
musicians
in
318
u.s.
741,
318
u.s.
741,
the
per
curiam
opinion
affirming
47
federal
supplement
304.
there,
this
court
held
that
a
dispute
over
whether
radio
stations
would
use
tamed
music
rather
than
live
orchestras
was
a
dispute
over
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
under
the
norris-laguardia
act.
and
of
course
in
the
telegraphers
case,
the
chicago
north
western
case,
this
court
held
that
closing
stations
reorganizing
the
setup
for
the
business
in
that
sense.
and
pursuant
thereto,
laying
off
employees
was
a
dispute
over
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
and
it
said
in
the
course
of
the
opinion
that
this
was
something
that
the
union
and
the
management
has
a
fair
to
bargain
about.
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
what
was
to
be
bargained
about,
it's
a
great
deal
narrowed
in
words
than
the
language
of
this
act.
now,
mr.
plant
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
so.
the
rest
were
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
(inaudible)
that
it
answered
to
arguments
made
but
i
don't
believe
it
was
absolutely
essential.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
but
let
me
point
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
certainly
true.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
want
to
say
a
word,
if
i
have
time
about
what's
meant
by
required
to
be
bargained
about
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
because
that
i
think
is
--
can
be
over
simplified
the
moment
i
am
simply
discussing.
the
question
under
8
(d)
and
9
(a)
whether
this
is
a
term
or
condition
of
employment,
it
does
not
automatically
follow
that
on
every
occasion
whatever
the
circumstances
are
is
the
statutory
duty
to
bargain
about
such
a
thing.
if
you
answer
this
question
no,
it's
not
a
term
or
condition
of
employment.
there
will
never
be
a
duty
to
bargain
about.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
answer
it
yes,
then
one
has
to
go
on
and
to
inquire
on
what
were
the
employer's
duties
under
the
particular
circumstances,
and
they
may
vary
a
good
deal
as
we
have
sought
to
explain
in
our
brief.
but
it
seems
to
be
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
one
can't
dispose
of
those
cases
simply
by
saying
that
they
rest
under
norris-laguardia
act.
the
national
labor
relations
act
has
a
definition
of
labor
dispute.
it
is
the
identical
definition
it
found
in
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
it
includes
the
phrase
--
in
fact
it
says
the
controversy
about
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
or
the
association
of
representation
of
persons
in
seeking
to
arrange
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
and
it
seems
incredible
to
me
to
suppose
that
the
definition
of
labor
dispute
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
differs
from
its
parent
in
the
norris-laguardia
act.
and
even
more
incredible
to
suppose
that
the
word
“terms
or
conditions
of
employment”
in
one
section
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
has
a
different
meaning
than
it
had
in
other
sections
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now,
so
much
for
the
words,
our
second
reason
and
i
think
this
is
important
as
a
limiting
factor
in
some
cases
as
well
as
an
affirmative
factor
helping
us
with
this
case
and
this
is
why
i
say
i
don't
rely
on
the
words
alone.
second,
we
think
that
the
established
practices
in
collective
bargaining
show
that
contracting
out
as
here
involved
--
is
regarded
as
involving
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
or
the
business
practices
the
industrial
practices
i
should
say,
the
practice
in
collective
bargaining,
are
certainly
relevant
under
this
court's
repeated
holding
that
the
term
collective
bargaining
as
used
in
the
labor
act,
is
considered
to
absorb
and
give
effect
to
the
philosophy
of
collective
bargaining
as
worked
out
in
the
labor
movement
in
the
united
states.
or
in
the
phrase
that
is
always
seemed
to
me
a
very
happy
one
also
take
it
for
the
tax
case,
we
think
that
what
is
involved
here
as
justice
cardozo
said
of
the
phrase
ordinary
and
necessary
expenses
of
a
business
in
a
tax
case
is
not
a
role
of
our
law,
not
words
of
art,
but
a
reference
to
a
way
of
life
and
that
it's
proper
to
look
at
that
way
of
life,
not
to
find,
as
he
put
it,
the
answer
to
the
riddle.
now
here,
experience
shows
that
contracting
out
or
subcontracting
has
been
widely
and
effectively
brought
within
the
framework
of
collective
bargaining.
now,
the
evidence
is
all
in
our
brief
and
i
referred
to
it
very
briefly,
a
study
of
1700
major
contract
showed
that
almost
repeatedly,
18%
i
think,
contain
some
kind
of
restriction
on
the
employer's
freedom
to
contract
out
or
subcontract
work
and
those
contract
cover
around
three
quarters
of
a
million
employees.
and
this
of
course
does
not
include
any
of
the
instances
in
which
there
was
bargaining
and
the
union
was
unable
to
get
a
term
put
in
the
contract.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
have
--
i'd
answer
it
--
could
answer
that
right
now.
it
would
have
no
effect
whatsoever
on
those
cases.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
would
then
have
to
--
i
think
that
what
happens
mr.
justice,
during
the
term
of
a
contract,
goes
to
the
question
i
sought
to
distinguish
a
moment
ago
and
tell
it
to
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
two
distinct
questions
here,
one
is
what
is
within
a
statutory
subject
of
bargaining
and
the
second
is
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
duty
to
bargain
under
particular
circumstances
and
one
of
the
most
important
of
those
circumstances
is
the
existence
of
a
contract.
mr.
archibald
cox
now,
if
a
contract
for
example,
reserved
to
the
employer
the
right
to
contract
out
without
consulting
the
union,
during
the
term
of
that
contract
he
would
have
that
right
and
there
could
be
no
question
about
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
absolutely.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
only
that
but
you
have
under
this
court's
decision
in
america
national
insurance
the
right
to
bargain
for
this
unilateral
control.
indeed
that
was
the
subject
of
the
article
that
mr.
plant
quoted
the
small
part
of
apparently
without
reading
the
rest.
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
well,
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
can't
believe
he
would
quote
it
like
he
did
if
he'd
read
it
all.
if
there
is
a
contract
that
contains
no
such
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
what?
mr.
archibald
cox
no
sir.
i
don't
mean
to
be
(inaudible)
--
quite
so
vivid
about
it
but
i
don't.
if,
mr.
justice
white,
there
is
a
contract
and
it
says
nothing
about
subcontracting,
then
we
have
a
quite
different
question.
one
(inaudible)
--
which
maybe
here
in
the
adams
dairy
case,
one
on
which
the
board
has
a
number
of
roles,
one
which
is
in
my
judgment
an
intensely
difficult
problem.
but
that's
not
here,
because
this
was
at
what
petitioner
regarded
as
the
end
of
the
contract
and
this
certainly
wasn't
the
kind
of
a
periodic
contracting
out
as
to
which
there
might
be
an
established
way
of
doing
things.
and
therefore,
no
prohibition
against
unilateral
action
until
the
union
desired
to
make
a
change,
and
lots
of
questions
of
that
kind
not
in
this
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
when
you
say
this
case,
this
is
the
case
in
which
the
existing
contract
had
come
to
an
end.
mr.
archibald
cox
so,
it's
out
of
the
picture.
if
its
--
if
what
it
seemed
to
me
you
were
saying,
i
don't
want
to
put
words
in
your
mouth.
it
seemed
to
me
suppose
that
the
union
had
sought
to
bargain
about
subcontractor,
it
had
been
unable
to
get
anything
in
a
two-year
contract.
at
the
end
of
a
year,
the
employer
attempted
to
subcontract
and
the
union
came
in
and
charged
it
as
an
unfair
labor
practice.
i
say
then
one
would
have
a
question
not
under
8
(d)
and
9
(a),
but
under
8
(a)
(5)
and
essentially
referred
to
some
of
my
earlier
writing,
this
of
course
of
which
the
board
and
i
have
been
having
an
argument
for
ten
or
more
years.
it
made
--
but
that
isn't
the
present
case.
you
might
decide
that
either
way
after
deciding
for
us
here.
i
was
suggesting
that
the
uniform
practice
(inaudible)
--
excuse
me,
i
didn't
mean
uniform
practice,
that
an
establish
practice
in
collective
bargaining
as
shown
by
major
collective
bargaining
agreements
is
that
it
is
often
treated
as
a
term
or
condition
of
employment.
now,
of
course
petitioner
says,
“well,
people
put
all
kinds
of
funny
things
in
contracts”.
but
these
are
not
funny
companies.
these
are
the
pacific
maritime
association,
new
york
shipping
association,
sinclair
refining
company,
california
processors
and
growers,
at&t,
milwaukee
brewers,
the
automobile
industry,
ford,
chrysler,
and
american
motors,
the
rubber
industry,
u.s.
rubber,
goodyear,
and
goodrich
and
we
note
from
the
brief
of
the
union
respondents
here,
that
the
steel
industry
has
been
heavily
engaged
in
bargaining
about
this
subject.
we
also
cite
in
our
brief
and
i
don't
intend
to
do
more
intentionally,
a
volume
of
arbitration
decisions
showing
that
subcontracting
is
part
of
the
daily
quest
of
the
labor
management
relationship
under
arbitration.
decisions
of
the
war
labor
board
and
at
least
one
decision
of
a
presidential
emergency
board
in
the
airline
industry.
mr.
archibald
cox
only
this
i
think,
that
they
do
--
i
don't
cite
them
as
authority
one
way
or
another.
i
simply
cite
it
for
the
proposition
that
this
is
a
problem
that
has
been
thought
of
and
is
a
practice
widely
and
selectively
dealt
with
as
part
as
something
incidental
to
the
employment
relationship,
so
close
that
it's
within
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
some
of
the
things
that
the
arbitrators
have
said
expressed
the
philosophy
that
tends
to
support
our
view.
but
it
doesn't
--
the
correctness
of
any
of
those
decisions
is
irrelevant.
they
are
evidence
of
a
fact,
of
a
condition,
of
a
way
of
life,
or
practice.
now,
our
third
reason
and
it's
--
i
might
interrupt
myself
just
for
a
moment
to
say
that
this
seems
to
me
may
properly
be
the
most
important
of
the
considerations
taken
into
account
by
the
board
in
giving
content
to
this
phrase
in
limiting
what
would
otherwise
be
the
sweeping
meaning
of
the
terms.
and
one
of
the
things
that
perhaps
will
have
to
be
argued
here
someday
is
whether
these
cases
that
mr.
plant
cites
having
to
do
with
closing
a
factory
and
such
are
different
because
there
you
can't
show
that
there
has
been
this
widespread
and
successful
practice
of
bargaining
about
the
subject
matter.
and
to
that
extent,
it
differs
and
makes
a
somewhat
different
case.
now,
our
third
reason
is
that
the
policy
of
the
act
is
very
clearly
advanced
by
the
decision
of
the
board
and
the
court
below.
i
hardly
need
to
argue
in
this
court
that
where
there
is
an
ambiguity
in
the
statute,
if
there
is
one
that
the
ambiguity
should
be
resolved
in
the
way
that
effectuates
the
purposes
of
the
act.
nor
do
i
need
to
argue
that
the
prime
purpose
of
this
act
is
to
promote
the
resolution
of
conflicts
of
interest
between
employers
and
employees
by
the
process
of
collective
negotiation
between
the
employers
and
the
employees.
it
is
a
fact
and
there's
no
magic
wand
that
will
wave
it
away.
it
is
a
fact
that
this
subject
today
is
a
manner
of
the
most
intense
concern
to
employees
and
it
is
a
fact
whatever
the
decision
to
this
case
it
will
remain
a
matter
of
most
intense
concern
and
they
will
of
course
be
free
to
strike
about
it.
now,
the
real
question
here
is
whether
that
conflict
of
interest
is
to
be
resolved
within
the
framework
that
congress
has
been
--
has
provided
or
whether
it
is
to
be
pushed
outside
into
the
same
condition
that
other
sharp
issues
between
management
and
labor
wherein
before
the
national
labor
relations
act
was
adopted.
and
i
suppose
that
one
of
the
most
worries
of
things
about
mr.
plant's
contention,
is
that
in
a
period
where
employees'
attention,
not
employers
as
my
brief
unfortunately
says,
employees'
attention
is
riveted
on
changes
that
affect
their
tenure
on
their
jobs.
the
argument
is
made
that
all
those
changes
are
to
be
put
outside
the
processes
that
have
been
tested
and
provided
by
congress
over
a
good
many
years.
i
want
to
say
just
a
word
with
respect
to
the
cases.
mr.
plant
attempted
to
portray
and
he
did
portray
a
fixed
course
of
administrative
interpretation.
we
disagree
with
his
reading
of
most
of
the
cases.
that's
all
in
the
briefs.
with
three
parties
arguing
here,
we
all
see
them
a
little
differently.
i
see
them
as
charting
a
rather
uncertain
course
with
a
good
deal
of
variation
in
the
direction
of
the
board
was
looking
on
a
given
occasion.
and
i
think
that's
quite
natural
because
that
was
a
period
when
the
practices
in
industry
were
developing.
now,
as
we
think
the
evidence
shows
very
clearly
bargaining
about
subcontracting
has
become
an
established
--
a
common
way
of
doing
things.
it
is
widely
and
successfully
treated
as
a
condition
of
employment.
so
the
board
then
adopted
a
role,
not
breaking
new
ground,
as
it
said
in
one
of
these
cases
but
recognizing
a
condition
that
existed
in
the
industrial
world.
whether
i'm
right
or
not
in
that,
certainly
mr.
plant
is
wrong
in
saying
that
there
was
a
consistent
course
of
interpretation
contrary
to
this
decision
because
the
timken
roller
bearing
case
which
was
--
as
i
said
before
cited
by
this
court
in
teamsters
against
oliver
squarely
held
against
it
in
1945
or
1946,
just
prior
to
the
taft-hartley
amendments
which
made
no
change
in
the
act.
i
indicated
that
there
were
two
other
issues
in
the
case.
the
question
whether
the
employer
violated
section
8
(a)
(5)
here
turns
first
on
whether
this
contracting
out
involved
terms
or
conditions
of
employment
and
second,
on
whether
he
had
a
duty
to
consult
with
the
union
before
making
unilateral
change.
we
think
that
in
this
case
as
we
argue
in
the
brief
they
were
done
of
the
conditions
that
by
excuse
prior
consultation
with
the
union,
and
since
the
finding
below
and
the
limited
grant
of
certiorari
which
makes
irrelevant
to
great
many
things
that
mr.
plant
argued
is,
established
that
he
didn't
bargained
before
he
determined
to
do
this.
and
as
i
understand
him,
he
doesn't
make
any
argument
that
he
had
no
duty
if
this
is
a
term
or
condition
of
employment.
the
second
issue
--
second
additional
issue
is
whether
the
order
of
reinstatement
and
to
bargain
was
erroneous.
on
that,
i
stand
on
my
brief
except
only
for
one
point.
what
mr.
plant
says
in
his
reply
brief
on
page
25,
there
will
be
found
no
case,
order
or
agree
in
the
statement
in
which
the
order
was
not
supported
by
a
finding
of
a
section
8
(a)
(3)
violation.
i
think
the
young
man
in
his
office
rather
let
it
down.
i
have
here
a
list
of
10
such
cases,
the
principle
one
being
nlrb
against
washington
aluminum
company
decided
by
this
court
one
or
two
terms
ago
in
370
u.s.
those
10
are
all
cases
in
which
there
was
only
an
8
(a)
(1)
violation.
there
was
no
8
(a)
(3)
violation.
then
in
the
argument
here
he
said,
“well,
it'd
be
found
no
case
prior
to
this
one
in
which
there
was
an
order
or
reinstatement
made
where
there
was
only
a
section
8
(a)
(5)
violation”.
i
have
three
of
those,
all
board
decisions,
all
before
this
case,
the
earliest
going
back
to
87
nlrb.
i'd
be
glad
to
send
a
letter
up
this
afternoon
giving
the
court
the
citations
without
any
further
argument
rather
than
reading
them
aloud.
i
promise
mr.
feller
the
remainder
of
the
time.
