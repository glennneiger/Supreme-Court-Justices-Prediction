mr.
david
e.
feller
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
what
the
solicitor
general
has
told
the
court
places
this
case
in
the
proper
focus.
i
don't
certainly
want
to
repeat
what
he
said
but
i
do
want
to
emphasize
what
happened
in
this
case
because
mr.
plant
took
so
long
to
describe
the
exact
sequence
of
events.
he
did
describe
the
fact
that
the
employer
was
concerned
about
his
maintenance
cost.
what
happened
--
he
had
raised
the
question
in
collective
bargaining
and
he
was
unable
to
make
a
dent
in
the
collective
bargaining
with
the
union.
when
the
union
then
reopened
the
contract
in
may
of
1959,
the
following
in
suit
the
union,
one,
two,
three,
four
times
tried
to
arrange
for
a
collective
bargaining
conference.
i
think
the
exact
sequence
is
set
out
in
the
trial
examiners
intermediate
report
and
nothing
happened.
the
company
refused
to
meet.
meanwhile,
they
were
busily
scurrying
around
to
determine
whether
they
could
save
money
on
labor
cost
through
the
device
of
letting
this
to
a
subcontractor
whose
people
would
come
in
and
perform
the
same
work
under
less
onerous
labor
conditions.
after
they
had
determined
that
they
could
do
this,
on
july
27,
four
days
before
the
60-day
negotiating
period
provided
under
the
statute
had
expired,
they
called
the
union
in
and
said,
“this
will
come
as
a
shock
to
you,
but
there's
no
point
in
bargaining
contract.
we'd
contracted
out
all
the
work”.
now,
mr.
plant
did
not
bring
before
this
court
the
question
of
whether
in
fact
he
had
bargained
with
the
union
about
contracting
out
the
work.
he
sought
to
bring
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
he
had
not
before
the
court
in
his
second
question
in
his
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
court
limited
the
grant.
so
that
question
was
not
really
briefed
by
us
and
is
not
merely
here.
we
operate
on
the
assumption
here
that
the
only
questions
are
the
two
questions
which
are
before
the
court
is
once
he
under
a
duty
to
bargain,
and
second
of
all
was
the
remedy
by
the
board
appropriate.
and
i
think
you
have
to
get
the
flavor
of
what
happened
here
to
understand
what
we
mean
by
the
duty
to
bargain.
now,
this
case
has
been
argued
so
far
on
kind
of
mixing
up,
i
think
mr.
plant
has
taken
two
questions
or
maybe
there
are
three
and
put
them
into
one.
one
is
the
duty
to
bargain
simpliciter,
that
is
if
a
union
comes
to
an
employer
at
the
bargaining
table
and
says,
“we
want
to
negotiate
the
provision
about
contracting
out”,
or
the
employer
wants
to
come
and
said,
“we
would
like
a
provision
and
agreement
saying
we
have
the
right
to
contract
out
work
at
all
times”.
is
this
a
subject
which
the
act
requires
the
parties
to
meet
and
confer
about
in
an
attempt
to
reach
agreement.
that's
the
simple
meaning
of
the
duty
to
bargain
in
good
faith.
mr.
plant
says,
“no”.
that
when
the
union
says
--
comes
to
the
employer
and
says,
“we
think
our
people
are
losing
jobs
because
you're
sending
work
out
of
the
plant
or
you're
bringing
people
in
the
plant
to
take
our
people's
jobs,
and
we
want
to
bargain
about
that”.
mr.
plant
says,
the
employer
can
say,
“under
the
act,
i
don't
have
to
talk
to
you
about
that
subject
and
i
won't”.
on
the
brief,
we
say
that
the
result
of
that
holding
would
be
that
the
union
couldn't
even
strike
on
that
subject
and
i
confess
here
that
was
a
mistake.
under
the
law,
if
mr.
plant
were
correct,
the
union
could
not
refuse
to
sign
a
contract
on
the
ground
that
it
didn't
contain
a
provision
about
contracting
out.
and
couldn't
go
on
strike
under
those
circumstances
because
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
union's
duty
to
bargain.
having
reached
agreement
on
everything
else,
the
union
could
not
insist
on
this
subject.
he
would
take
this
out
of
that
area
and
certainly
the
cases
seem
to
indicate
that
the
unions
strike
in
support
of
a
demand
for
some
restriction
on
the
company's
right
to
contract
out
would
be
an
unprotected
activity.
and
the
employer
could
discharge
people
for
it.
now,
that's
the
simple
question.
now,
there
are
only
two
cases
of
the
board,
this
long
recitation
of
cases
that
deal
with
that
kind
of
case.
mr.
david
e.
feller
no,
but
the
first
question
--
the
question
which
mr.
plant
argues
is
that
that
there
is
no
duty
to
bargain
about
contracting
out.
the
second
question
is
assuming
there
is
a
duty
as
there
their
duty
to
bargain
about
wages,
once
we
put
the
subject
within
the
area,
then
under
what
circumstances
does
unilateral
action
by
the
employer
without
bargaining
constitute
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(5).
that's
the
second
question.
he
does
not
argue
that
question.
he
argue
--
puts
his
whole
question
although
this
is
a
unilateral
action
case
on
the
assumption
that
it
is
not
within
the
duty
in
the
first
place.
but
i
think
this
court
has
got
to
separate
out
those
questions
because
they
are
different
questions.
but
the
first
question
is,
is
it
within
the
duty
to
bargain
in
the
timken
case
which
the
solicitor
general
cited.
it
was
the
only
case
and
i
think
one,
hughes
tool
case
which
arose
during
the
term
of
the
contract
and
the
board
said
that
the
union
had
waived
the
obligation
to
bargain
because
the
union
want
--
were
the
only
two
cases
on
that
question.
and
it
was
perfectly
clear
in
1947
that
there
was
a
duty
to
bargain
about
contracting
out.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
right.
mr.
david
e.
feller
and
indeed
even
in
the
unilateral
action
cases,
of
the
three
cases
that
have
been
talked
about,
this
case,
town
&
country
and
adams
dairy
which
is
pending
for
cert,
two
of
those
cases
adams
dairy
and
town
&
country,
the
trial
examiners
who
were
bound
by
board
decision
had
decided
and
said
explicitly
it's
well
established
that
there
is
a
duty
to
bargain
about
contracting
out
and
found
employer
violations
by
unilateral
action
in
1960
before
the
board
announced
the
supposedly
new
change
in
doctrine
and
before
there
was
the
change
in
the
membership
of
the
board
that's
been
talked
about.
so,
but
that's
--
that
again
gets
into
the
unilateral
action
case.
now,
once
we
established
that
there
is
a
duty
to
bargain,
then
this
is
just
like
wages
or
any
other
subject
within
the
scope
of
8
(a)
(5)
duty
to
bargain.
and
the
question
is
under
what
circumstances
does
employer's
action
without
prior
consultation
with
the
union
can
be
said
to
be
a
refusal
to
meet
and
confer
with
the
union
and
then
violates
8
(a)
(5)
not
because
of
the
subject
matter
but
because
of
the
nature
of
the
action.
i
put
aside
immediately
any
case
in
which
there's
a
contract
on
the
subject,
as
in
the
steel
industry,
we
now
have
what
we
call
an
experimental
agreement.
but
sadly,
the
solicitor
general's
figures
about
the
employees
covered
omitted
350,000
people
who
were
not
covered
at
the
time
of
that
study
in
the
basic
steel
agreement.
basic
steel
industry
in
which
we
have
agreements
concerning
contracting
out
just
like
an
agreement
concerning
wages.
if
you
have
an
agreement
concerning
wages
and
the
employer
changes
the
wage
or
doesn't
pay
the
wage,
you
file
a
grievance,
then
you
violated
the
agreement.
you
don't
file
a
refusal
to
bargain
charge
because
he's
not
suppose
to
bargain
about
wages,
he
suppose
to
comply
with
the
agreement.
similarly,
if
you
have
a
provision
in
an
agreement
about
contracting
out,
there
is
no
unilateral
action
question.
there's
a
question
of
violation
to
the
agreement
and
that
maybe
true
even
if
there
is
an
implied
provision
in
the
agreement
not
only
in
expressed
provision.
and
the
cases
--
the
arbitration
cases
are
interesting
because
many
arbitrators
have
found
that
there
are
implied
provisions
about
contracting
out.
but
at
least
the
unilateral
action
case
is
only
two.
one,
and
a
very
difficult
one
as
i
really
would
like
to
put
it
aside
in
view
of
the
limitation
of
time,
the
case
where
there
is
an
agreement
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
agreement
about
contracting
out.
and
then
you
get
the
whole
argument
as
to
whether
is
a
continuing
duty
to
bargain
about
matters
not
covered
by
an
agreement
during
the
term
of
that
agreement.
but
the
easiest
case
is
this
case
in
which
the
employer
at
least
he
had
the
view
that
the
contract
had
expired
seizes
that
moment
and
very
carefully,
this
wasn't
done
during
the
term
of
those
agreement,
seizes
that
moment
to
get
rid
of
all
of
his
employees
and
saying
other
people
are
coming
in
to
do
your
job
and
we've
hired
an
independent
contractor
to
do
it.
now,
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
clear
that
in
that
case,
if
there
is
a
duty
to
bargain
about
contracting
out
in
the
simple
sense
which
i
first
said,
equally,
the
employer's
action
in
simply
doing
it
and
then
telling
the
union
about
it
later
and
telling
the
people
they
have
no
jobs,
and
therefore
as
they
said
in
writing,
there
is
pointless
to
bargain
about
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
kind
of
an
action
is
the
refusal
to
meet
and
confer
which
the
act
required.
now,
it
is
particularly
clear
since
mr.
tuman,
their
labor
relations
man
said,
“i
didn't
want
to
meet
with
the
union
all
this
time
because
we
have
to
decide
first
whether
we're
going
to
contract
it
out.
and
i
didn't
want
to
go
through
the
useless
business
of
negotiating
with
them
until
we've
made
a
decision.
and
then
the
minute
we
made
the
decision,
it
was
done,
then
i
met
to
tell
them
that
there
was
no
point
in
talking
about
their
wages
and
working
conditions
because
we
had
somebody
coming
in
here
whose
wages
and
working
conditions
were
cheaper.
and
he
would
talk
then
about
severance
pay.
mr.
david
e.
feller
yes.
i
think
that's
right.
they
take
the
position
that
--
and
they
have
never
claimed
any
savings
on
this
other
than
these
lower
and
cheaper
conditions
that
they
worked
out
with
these
--
this
employer
had.
i
think
it's
interesting
that
the
record
shows
not
only
the
nature
of
the
savings,
but
that
part
of
the
contract
that
this
company
made
with
fluor
was
the
wage
scales
which
fluor
would
pay
to
its
employees.
it's
annexed
as
an
appendix
to
the
contract
with
fibreboard
because
it
was
a
straight
cost-plus
deal.
and
if
indeed
of
the
--
the
proposal
said
the
supervision
will
operate
under
your
direction,
it
will
be
--
there
will
be
an
integral
part
of
your
workforce
and
we
have
these
great
advantages
in
our
labor
contracts,
and
these
are
the
rates
which
we're
going
to
pay.
you
will
repay
us
not
only
labor
cost,
stationary,
telephone,
and
everything,
this
was
a
straight
cost-plus
deal
5%
over,
that's
what
they
amounted
to.
it
was
a
kind
of
a
brokerage
fee
for
supplying
cheap
labor,
that's
what
it
was.
now,
i
think
that
ends
the
matter,
i
think
in
terms
of
--
if
this
is
within
the
subject
matter
and
i
do
not
conceive
that
this
court
could
hold
or
i
suppose
it
could
but
i
would
--
it
would
be
a
shocking
thing
to
say
that
the
kind
of
thing
which
is
at
the
heart
of
the
railroad
lately
(inaudible)
--
dispute
in
the
railroads
which
has
been
so
much
in
everybody's
attention,
the
recent
shock
disputes
to
the
railroads
that
almost
caused
a
nationwide
shutdown,
the
critical
issue
there
was
to
contracting
out
of
work.
they've
--
a
little
one
--
a
little
further.
there,
we'll
have
what
they
call
unit
exchange,
you'd
--
our
armature
would
go
bad.
used
to
have
people
in
the
shops,
this
happens
in
the
steel
industry
too.
they
have
armature
winders
or
repair
armatures.
a
company
says,
“well,
we
can
do
this
cheaper”.
we
sell
this
armature
and
we
would
buy
a
rebuilt
one.
they
do
this
on
a
such
a
course
of
action
that
what
it
really
amounts
to
is
having
the
work
done
in
little
shop
around
the
corner
where
there's
a
nonunion
shop
that
does
the
work
cheap.
and
that
kind
of
thing
under
the
steel
agreement
is
covered
in
the
agreement.
that
kind
of
thing
is
clearly
within
the
duty
to
bargain
if
the
bargaining
that
takes
place
in
the
united
states
has
anything
to
do
with
collective
bargaining
because
that's
what
people
are
bargaining
about.
the
longshore
dispute
to
which
there
is
now
a
taft-hartley
injunction,
the
whole
question
there
is
or
one
of
the
big
question
is
crew
size
and
under
what
conditions
the
employer
will
be
required
to
hire
people
when
we
says
he
doesn't
need.
the
short
of
the
matter
is
that
in
today's
collective
bargaining,
in
steel,
in
auto
incidentally,
this
was
an
issue.
in
every
industry
that
i
know,
unions
are
interested
in
and
bargain
about
to
the
best
of
their
ability
the
question
of
what
work
the
employer
will
provide
and
that
is
one
of
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
about
which
they
bargain.
and
it's
not
only
contracting
out,
sometime
it
is
sending
--
it's
a
make
or
buy
question.
will
you
continue
to
polish
steel
or
will
you
send
the
steel
out
to
be
polished?
will
you
--
the
number
of
cases
are
just
legion
in
which
this
kind
of
question
is
what
people
are
interested
in
because
today,
people
are
interested
in
jobs.
now,
what
mr.
plant
says
is
that
jobs
are
not
bargainable.
how
much
money
you
get,
yes
but
not
jobs.
and
what
we
say
is
the
job
is
in
the
essence
of
bargaining.
and
once
we
say
that
it
comes
within
the
scope
of
bargaining,
then
we
think
clearly
the
unilateral
action
which
they
took
in
this
case,
in
this
case
constitute
the
violation
of
8
(a)
(5),
not
necessarily
in
the
other
cases
which
are
imagined
in
the
amicus
briefs
because
most
of
those
are
taken
care
of.
in
the
situation
there
is
a
contract
dealing
with
the
subject
expressly
or
impliedly,
or
and
i
think
here
is
an
important
question.
assuming
no
contract,
if
as
in
the
electronics
industry
were
contracting
if
the
status
quo,
i
think
this
court
in
the
katz
case,
in
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion
dealt
with
the
--
what
claimed
there,
there
was
a
wage
increase,
a
merit
increase
while
bargaining
was
going
on
and
with
no
contract
in
effect.
and
the
claim
was
that
this
was
a
merit
increase
in
accordance
with
the
employer's
usual
practice
and
the
court's
opinion
said,
“well,
the
question
is,
was
that
really
the
status
quo,
not
necessary
the
same
wage
rate
at
each
minute,
but
that
things
were
done
in
the
same
way
that
they
had
been
done
before.
because
if
that
were
so
then
there
is
no
change
in
conditions,
there
being
no
changing
conditions,
there
is
no
refusal
to
bargain
them,
in
making
the
change
without
bargaining.
in
the
case
in
which
contracting
out
is
a
matter
of
routine,
then
even
in
the
absence
of
a
contract
pursuing
that
routine
is
not
a
refusal
to
bargain
anymore
than
a
merit
increase
is
a
refusal
to
bargain
by
make
--
changing
in
wages
because
both
are
part
of
the
usual
way
of
doing
business.
they
are
part
of
status
quo.
the
only
thing
that
is
a
refusal
to
bargain,
because
they
do
so,
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(5),
in
any
subject
coming
within
8
(a)
(5)
is
a
change
in
the
terms
and
conditions
without
first
bargaining
with
the
union.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
think
that's
one
of
the
most
difficult
questions.
i
think
that
if
it
is
most
--
again,
in
most
cases,
i
don't
have
that
problem
because
most
contracts
which
i've
had
had
anything
to
do
with
negotiating
have
a
management
rights
cost
in
which
pretty
clearly
gives
the
management
the
right
to
go
out
of
business
or
to
cut
down
the
volume
of
business
at
any
time.
i
should
think
that
the
board's
cases
now
and
that's
not
this
case.
i
think
this
case
is
an
easy
case,
would
seem
to
me
to
indicate
that
the
employer
would
have
a
duty
to
talk
to
the
union
about
the
matter
before
he
did
it.
now,
the
amount
of
time
he
had
to
talk
to
them
assuming
no
contract
or
a
contract
which
didn't
expressly
or
impliedly
given
the
right
to
do
it,
so
we
have
a
limited
number
of
cases
anyway.
i
would
say
the
amount
of
time
he
has
to
talk
to
them
and
the
amount
depends
upon
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case.
most
of
the
cases
come
up
are
cases
like
darlington
which
your
honors
will
hear
and
which
he
goes
out
of
business
but
he
really
isn't
going
out
of
business.
he's
just
tucking
the
business
around
in
another
plant
for
some
other
reasons.
i
suppose
if
a
guy
is
going
broke,
he's
going
broke.
i
don't
know
what
the
board
could
order
and
do
in
that
case.
well,
that's
--
as
i
--
your
honor
is
just
a
very
difficult
case.
i
should
think
that
the
board's
decisions
as
i
read
them
say
that
if
it's
--
that
their
duty
to
bargain
does
include
the
duty
to
talk
to
the
union
before
you
go
out
of
business.
mr.
david
e.
feller
sometimes,
they
do
that.
the
(inaudible)
workers
put
up
a
lot
of
money
to
put
or
keep
a
business
out
of
the
thing.
the
mine
workers
did
that
and
for
that
reason
and
others
have
been
sought
with
a
very
substantial
antitrust
judgment.
but
sometimes
you
do
put
money
into
companies
to
keep
them
from
going
out
of
business,
and
sometimes,
i
participated
in
this
many
times
where
people
are
shutting
down
a
plant,
you
cut
wages.
so
that
you
can
keep
that
plant
going.
but,
you
know,
you'll
lose
that
opportunity
if
the
employer
said,
“that's
it
boys,
it's
done”.
in
any
case,
i
think
that
this
is
clear.
well,
that
isn't
this
case
because
this
case
is
a
case
where
he's
going
out
of
business
but
really
going
--
not
going
out
of
business
he's
just
having
somebody
else
to
the
business
for
him
at
lower
wage
rates.
now,
in
the
short
time
remaining,
i
want
to
say
just
a
word
about
remedy.
i
think
it
is
clear,
as
the
solicitor
general
said
that
the
board
has
ordered
reinstatement
in
a
number
of
cases,
it
is
even
clearer
in
this
case
that
there
in
fact
would
be
no
substance
to
the
duty
to
bargain
if
these
people
aren't
put
back
to
work
and
they
start
from
bargaining
somewhere.
it
maybe
very
nice
for
mr.
plant
to
say
he
will
talk
to
us
but
we're
going
to
be
talking
in
a
very
peculiar
position.
i
want
to
point
out
that
in
all
these
delay
in
the
board's
decision
has
unfortunately
from
the
view
point
of
the
workers
that
i
represent
here,
cost
not
mr.
plant
or
his
client
but
the
workers.
the
board
only
ordered
back
pay
to
run
from
the
date
of
its
supplemental
decision
in
this
case
not
from
the
time
back
in
1959
when
they're
thrown
out
on
the
street.
and
so
there
is
no
horrendous
imposition
or
punitive
imposition
on
fibreboard
to
the
contrary
under
the
board's
decision
as
it
stands.
the
biggest
losers
were
and
remained
the
people
in
the
steelworkers
unit
who
were
thrown
out
on
the
street
in
1959
and
who
will
get
back
and
lose
back
pay
for
better
than
two
years
if
they
were
unemployed
in
that
period
as
a
result
of
decision
to
give
their
work
to
some
other
people,
a
other
union.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
all
he
has
to
do
is
offer
them
reinstatement.
if
he
offers
and
that
they
don't
come
back
--
he's
finished,
we're
finished.
but
he
objects
even
offering.
if
there
--
if
some
of
them
don't
come
back
as
a
result
of
the
offer,
he
should
be
relieved
and
perhaps
we
don't
have
any
problem.
i'm
sure
that
they
will
offer
--
that
they
will
come
back.
employment
is
not
that
good
that
this
is
so.
it
happens
that
this
is
an
amount
who
made
it
local,
very
unusual
for
the
steelworkers,
it's
an
old
machinist
local
and
it
represents
people
in
a
lot
of
different
plants
and
have
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
don't
know,
the
--
this
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
your
honor
i
think
all
it
does
is
asking
to
reinstate
the
maintenance
of
whatever
they're
doing.
maintenance
is
something
you
do
on
machines
while
they're
working.
they
came
before
the
board
and
wanted
to
show
that
they
had
cut
out
certain
lines
of
manufacture
in
the
plant.
now,
if
that
so
there
is
probably
less
maintenance
to
be
done
there.
i
don't
think
that
the
board
has
order
--
orders
them
to
maintain
machinery
that
isn't
there.
it
just
says,
start
doing
the
maintenance
work
with
your
people
or
offer
these
people
reinstatement
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
we
have
not
alleged
that
the
elimination
of
some
lines
of
manufacturer
in
this
plant
will
constitute
a
refusal
to
bargain
and
that
isn't
the
question.
the
only
question
here
is
maintaining
the
maintenance
force,
keeping
in
condition
the
machinery
that
was
there.
we
are
not
asking
that
we
--
they
maintain
machinery
that
is
no
longer
there,
obviously
the
board
could
not
order
it.
this
is
a
question
that
is
normally
worked
out
in
compliance
proceedings
with
the
board.
if
you
have
ordered
reinstatement
with
back
pay
of
certain
people
who
were
discharged
in
a
typical
8
(a)
(3)
case,
and
business
is
bad,
then
you
go
back
to
the
employer
and
you
say,
“well
how
many
people
are
you
operating
with?”
and
that's
the
number
of
people
you
have
to
take
back.
you
don't
have
to
take
people
back
to
non-existing
jobs.
now
in
this
case,
these
jobs,
the
maintenance
jobs
are
still
there,
some
of
them.
the
contracting
out
here
was
not
the
cutting
of
manufacturer.
the
contracting
out
was
bringing
in
somebody
else
to
do
the
maintenance
work.
the
board
orders
them
to
reinstate
the
people
to
the
maintenance
work
at
that
plant
if
that
happens
to
be
less
at
this
moment
i
assume
that
there
will
be
somewhat
less
the
number
of
jobs
available.
but
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
assume
that
that
exist
those
--
i
don't
want
to
talk
about
jobs
because
its
not
jobs
in
the
employer.
the
employer
said
there
are
no
jobs.
mr.
david
e.
feller
it
orders
that
the
employer
to
resume
doing
the
maintenance
work
required
in
the
plant
with
his
own
employees.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
--
this
would
get
to
again
whether
the
problems
will
always
get
into
compliance.
i
suppose
you
have
to
figure
out
what
point,
which
people
would
have
been
working
if
under
the
given
circumstance
--
if
i
may
have
to
recreate
the
situation.
i
don't
know
if
this
court
or
not.
and
i
think
that
that's
what
is
normally
done
on
back
pay
cases
where
you
get
people
who
are
discharged
for
cause
or
otherwise
ordered
reinstatement
under
the
section
10
of
the
act.
you
go
back
to
find
out
what
would've
happen
were
it
not
for
the
unfair
labor
practice
and
then
you
make
the
people
whole.
now,
that
involves
a
lot
of
very
difficult
computations
including
what
the
fellow
worked
--
earned
elsewhere,
what
unemployment
compensation,
you've
got
a
great
many
other
questions.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
think
that's
a
question
for
compliance
reasons.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
correct.
mr.
david
e.
feller
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
isn't
the
board
--
anything
the
board
could
do
about
it
at
this
stage.
it
normally
doesn't.
it
issues
in
a
broad
form
of
order
and
then
you
go
in
and
you
negotiate
with
the
compliance
people.
if
there's
a
problem
about
compliance,
then
i
suppose
it
could
relieve
this
in
contempt
problems
but
normally
that
never
get
there.
that's
the
proper
locus
for
that
discussion.
thank
you.
