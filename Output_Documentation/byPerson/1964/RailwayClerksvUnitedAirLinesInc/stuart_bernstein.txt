mr.
stuart
bernstein
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
this
case
was
tried
in
the
district
court
by
cross
motions
for
summary
judgments
supported
affidavits
of
both
parties.
the
complaint
--
the
naked
complaint,
i
would
concede
clearly
appears
to
state
a
simple
contract
claim.
the
affidavits,
however,
set
out
some
of
the
background
of
the
situation
and
some
of
the
relationships
of
the
parties
here,
analyze
to
this
that
the
court
addressed
itself
in
deciding
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
highsaw
has
stated
the
facts
and
he
and
i
just
simply
don't
see
them
the
same
way
and
i
like
to
review
them
rather
quickly,
if
i
may,
to
put
this
case
in
its
perspective.
the
capital-united
merger
was
unique
and
if
you
ascribe
some
uniqueness
to
the
result
of
this
contract,
i
think
it
arises
out
of
that.
the
examiner
found
that
this
was
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
industry
that
a
major
carrier
faced
foreclosure
of
a
creditor's
land,
this
was
the
vickers
which
held
the
paper
on
the
vicon
aircraft
and
was
about
to
foreclose.
the
court
of
appeals
which
ultimately
reviewed
the
merger
found
that
it
was
an
emergency
crash
measure
that
capital
wasn't
extremist.
and
it
was
--
in
this
posture,
that
the
merger
agreement
was
entered
into
and
the
matter
was
brought
before
the
civil
aeronautics
board.
now,
one
of
the
things
that
the
board
was
most
concerned
with
and
you
find
references
throughout
the
decision
of
the
examiner
and
of
the
board,
was
what
would
happen
the
employees
of
capital
in
either
event
if
the
merger
would
be
approved
or
if
the
merger
were
to
be
denied
because
the
civil
aeronautics
board
under
at
section
408
of
the
federal
aviation
act
has
authority
to
approve
mergers
if
it
finds
them
in
the
public
interest
and
on
such
terms
and
conditions
as
it
finds
just
unreasonable
and
it
is
under
this
clause
that
the
labor
protective
provisions
discussed
by
mr.
cox
are
imposed
by
the
board.
now,
the
board
found
the
cab,
i
better
refer
to
them
this,
we
know
which
board
we're
talking
about
here.
the
cab
found
that
if
the
merger
were
not
improved,
capital
would
go
out
of
business
and
the
7600
employees
would
lose
their
employment.
however,
if
the
merger
were
improved,
not
only
would
their
employment
continue
since
united
had
made
an
undertaking
that
all
employees
other
than
officers
of
capital
would
become
employees
of
united.
but
that
in
addition,
their
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
at
united
would
be
equal
or
superior
to
those
that
they
enjoyed
at
capital.
and
at
the
same
time,
the
board
found
that
the
merger
would
be
in
the
public
interest
because
the
deficit
of
about
$1,700,000
which
capital
had
in
1959,
the
year
of
preceding
the
merger
hearing,
that
the
savings
which
would
result
from
the
consolidation
of
facilities
and
employees
at
the
12
common
points
served
by
the
two
carriers
would
be
more
than
enough
to
wipe
out
their
deficit.
that
is
the
saving
was
estimated
about
$1,900,000.
now,
all
of
these
was
before
the
board,
all
these
was
considered
and
united's
position
that
it
could
improve
the
conditions
of
employment
was
predicated
on
its
position
that
this
employees
would
come
under
united's
collective
bargaining
agreements
or
united's
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
unilaterally
imposed
for
its
employees
were
not
organized
and
these
were
in
almost
areas
in
superior
to
those
of
capital.
so
for
example,
the
examiner
found
that
the
pensions
would
improve,
that
there
would
be
an
average
increase
for
50%
of
the
capital
employees
of
$225
a
year
in
their
wages.
but
their
insurance
benefits,
health
and
accident
benefits,
dependency
coverage,
all
these
would
improve.
our
affidavits
additionally
showed
that
the
vacation
benefits
would
be
improved,
that
matters
of
this
kind
would
all
be
superior
at
the
united
rather
than
at
capital.
now,
when
we
put
this
before
the
courts
before,
our
position
wasn't
--
we
did
this
in
an
off-handed
matters
in
this
although
perhaps
of
no
legal
significance
nonetheless
this
is
the
case,
i
suppose
we
were
trying
to
impress
the
court
with
the
equity
of
the
situation
that
nobody
was
really
being
hurt
by
this.
but
i
think
the
wiley
case
has
placed
this
in
a
different
posture
and
this
now
does
become
a
matter
of
legal
significance
so
if
this
court
was
obviously
concerned
with
the
impact
of
an
unregulated
merger
on
the
interest
of
employees
and
since
this
is
a
regulated
merger
and
the
impact
was
otherwise,
i
think
it
now
assume
some
legal
significance,
and
i
don't
think
i'm
quite
as
diffident
about
this
point
as
i
was
in
earlier
stages
of
this
litigation.
while
the
brotherhood
intervened
in
this
proceeding
before
the
cab
and
it
said,
“we
ask
you
to
impose
on
united
as
a
condition
of
the
merger
our
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
we
had
with
capital.”
and
they
said,
“the
reason
we're
doing
this,”
this
is
in
the
examiner's
report,
“is
because
the
merger
agreement
makes
no
provision
for
its
continuation.”
now,
we
argue
this,
the
brotherhood's
position
was
twofold.
one,
that
as
a
matter
of
law
it
survived
and
two,
in
any
event,
it
should
be
imposed
as
a
condition
under
the
408
authority
of
the
board,
composed
just
and
reasonable
conditions,
we
defended.
we
said,
“it
does
not
survive
as
a
matter
of
law
and
in
any
event,
it
would
be
an
onerous
condition
to
impose
on
us
to
require
us
to
have
duplicate
and
conflicting
working
conditions
for
employees
working
side
by
side.”
now,
the
argument
is
made
that
this
is
the
first
time
of
30
years
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
were
not
assumed
by
the
surviving
carrier
and
mergers
under
the
railway
labor
act
under
the
--
yes,
be
the
railroads
or
airlines
under
the
railroad
labor
act.
i
pointed
out
that
this
was
a
unique
merger
the,
first
one
of
its
kind
where
it
was
done
so
to
speak
under
the
shotgun.
and
it
was
necessary
if
united
was
to
realize
the
savings
of
$1,900,000
to
immediately
functionally
integrate
capital
into
united
system
so
that
overnight,
the
night
of
the
merger
took
place
on
june
1.
on
may
31st,
i
was
in
a
hotel
in
detroit
and
on
the
evening
of
may
31st,
they
took
it
off
across
the
streets
at
capital
and
the
next
morning
it's
says
united
and
on
june
1st,
the
airplane
said
united
and
not
capital.
the
disappearance
of
capital
was
immediate
and
complete.
it
have
to
be
else,
united
could
not
have
possibly
gone
into
this
merger
under
these
conditions.
now
mr.
highsaw
says,
when
the
board
really
didn't
pass
on
it
because
counsel
made
statement
at
the
court.
but
what
happened
was
the
board
said
about
this
contract,
this
is
a
matter
which
ought
to
arise
under
the
labor
protective
provisions.
one
of
the
provisions
was
that
if
there
was
going
to
be
any
rearrangement
of
employees
as
a
result
of
the
merger,
the
carrier
should
give
notice
to
that
affect.
and
it
said,
“you
should
give
notice
under
that
provision
which
is
section
11
of
the
labor
protective
provisions
to
all
employees
who
will
be
affected
by
the
laws
of
representation
and
collective
bargaining
agreement.”
now,
that
didn't
mean
that
if
united
was
to
give
that
notice,
that
contract
didn't
collapse
at
that
point
and
i
simply
don't
know
what
the
board
was
saying.
well,
we
went
ahead
and
gave
such
notice.
this
is
in
the
record.
and
immediately,
the
brotherhood
went
back
to
the
board
and
its
brief
--
the
petition
for
reconsideration
and
said,
“united
put
this
notice
up,
we're
going
to
lose
our
contract
and
we
want
you
to
reconsider
what
you
did.”
and
the
board
turned
down
that
petition.
at
that
point,
the
brotherhood
petitioned
the
court
of
appeals
to
review
and
they
raise
the
same
questions
about
the
surviving
--
the
survival
of
this
contract,
the
same
points
that
were
raised
in
the
district
court.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
affidavit
that
they
filed
in
support
of
their
motion
for
a
stay,
when
it
relates
to
the
contract
benefits
was
the
employees
are
alleged
to
have
lost
by
virtue
of
united's
refusal
to
take
over
this
contract.
those
provisions
are
verbatim.
the
same
in
the
affidavits
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
district
court
in
this
case
in
one
of
the
affidavits
in
this
record.
they
make
this
sa
--
same
allegations.
this
was
all
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
a
motion
for
a
stay
was
argued
a
few
days
before
the
merger
was
to
become
effective,
these
very
points
were
briefed
and
argued
and
the
court
of
appeals
denied
the
stay.
well
then
--
then
the
brotherhood
went
back
to
the
cab
to
recons
--
to
--
for
an
--
and
asked
the
cab
to
stay.
and
they
said,
“the
reason
we
want
you
to
do
this
among
others
is
that
we
were
told
in
court
by
counsel
for
the
cab
that
you
didn't
purport
to
pass
on
the
question
of
whether
this
survived
as
a
matter
of
law
or
contract.
now,
mr.
highsaw
said
and
that
what
the
counsel
said,
was
that
the
matters
should
be
left
to
private
litigation.
i
think
he
must
spoke
himself,
what
counsel
said
was,
it
should
be
left
to
private
argument,
private
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals
at
that
time.
and
it
was
argued
by
mr.
highsaw
and
by
myself
before
the
court
of
appeals
about
on
--
i
think
on
may
23rd,
1961.
he
did
not
say
to
private
litigation
but
private
argument
and
it
was
so
argued.
well
then,
the
hearing
schedule
was
setup,
a
briefing
schedule
was
setup
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
brotherhood
did
not
file
its
brief
and
finally
after
motions
to
delay
on
november
6th,
november
6th,
withdrew
its
petition
for
a
review
from
the
court
of
appeals
and
three
days
later,
started
this
action,
alleging
that
the
contract
was
not
assumed
by
united
and
did
not
survive.
now,
i
want
to
stop
at
this
point
if
you
please
your
honors,
to
point
out
that
at
this
juncture,
i
think
that
the
institution
at
this
suit
was
an
interference
with
the
whole
scheme
under
the
federal
aviation
act.
and
i
wish
to
cite
a
case
out
of
my
embarrassment,
not
cited
in
our
brief
to
this
court,
pan
american
and
world
airways
versus
united
states,
371
u.s.
296,
which
raises
many
analogies
to
the
case
we
have
here
and
in
that
case,
the
court
before
jurisdiction
to
the
cab
even
though
the
cab
did
not
have
any
proceeding
brought
before
it.
and
there,
the
cab
had
asked
the
attorney
general
to
institute
an
antitrust
suit
under
the
sherman
act
against
pan
am,
panagra
and
grace.
it
was
under
three
counts
of
the
sher
--
three
points
of
the
sherman
act
that
had
to
do
with
the
carving
up
of
the
markets
in
south
america
that
have
routes
between
the
east
coast
of
the
united
states
and
the
west
coast
of
south
america
and
somewhere
else
between
central
america
and
the
united
states.
the
district
court
dismissed
as
to
panagra
and
grace
but
found
that
pan
american
was
guilty
of
an
antitrust
violation.
it
was
civil
action
not
guilty
but
found
that
there
was
proper
basis
for
the
antitrust
action
against
pan
american.
the
case
that
came
up
to
this
court
directly,
and
this
court
held
that
the
cab
under
its
authority
under
section
411
of
the
federal
aviation
act,
should
take
control
of
this
matter
because
it
was
so
intimately
related
to
federally
--
to
freight
regulation
of
air
transport
and
that
the
court
should
not
intrude,
and
they
said
otherwise
would
have
two
agencies
looking
at
these
matters
and
it
ought
to
be
left
to
the
cab.
well
that
was
so
here
and
certainly
more
so
in
this
situation,
where
it
was
before
the
cab,
there
is
no
question
with
the
cab,
would
have
authority
to
either
impose
the
contract
or
to
say
the
contract
would
not
have
survived,
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
is
precisely
what
the
cab
did
in
a
--
an
earlier
merger
involving
pan
american
and
american
overseas
airways,
in
kent
versus
cab.
there,
the
two
groups
of
flight
engineers
or
the
two
companies
couldn't
agree
on
their
seniority,
how
to
merge
that.
the
board
took
jurisdiction
again
and
applied
seniority
in
a
strict
basis
of
length
of
service.
yes
sir?
mr.
stuart
bernstein
to
impose
such
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
--
to
do
this.
this
is
under
section
408
of
the
federal
(voice
overlap)
--
yes
sir?
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes
sir.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
i
think
sir
that
we
would
have
had
to
assume
that
as
a
condition
of
the
merger
or
have
had
the
alternative
of
not
going
at
with
the
merger.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
survives.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes
sir,
it
could
have
done
that.
now,
our
choice
would
have
been
then
to
appeal
that
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
say
this
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes
sir.
well,
not
directly
that
way.
in
the
kent
versus
the
cab
which
i
mentioned,
the
result
was
that
after
this
--
after
the
cab
did
direct
the
integration
of
seniority
on
straight
length
of
service,
the
flight
engineer
group
of
pan
am
started
a
proceeding
against
the
cab
claiming
it
just
simply
didn't
have
this
kind
of
authority
and
alleging
among
other
things
that
it
had
a
contract
with
pan
am
which
said
that
seniority
would
be
based
on
the
length
of
service
with
pan
am
and
not
with
any
other
airline.
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
cab
did
have
authority
to
abrogate
private
contracts
and
in
fact,
that
the
cab
in
effect
had
done
that
or
even
though
it
was
only
an
indirect
result
of
the
cab
action,
not
a
direct
result.
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
treated
it,
as
so
that
cab
had
revoked
the
contract
and
held
it
clearly
have
that
kind
of
authority.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
oh,
i
do
not
say
that
sir.
i
say
that
the
cab
would
have
this
authority
to
impose
it
as
a
condition
of
a
merger.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes
sir,
i
do.
yes
i
do.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
this
is
--
the
difficulty
here
is
placing
labels
on
this
kind
of
litigation.
if
you
view
this
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that's
correct.
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
if
you
view
this
as
simply
a
matter
of
does
this
contract
survived
for
the
period
of
time
between
the
merger
and
the
time
a
new
representative
is
selected,
if
any,
through
a
collect
--
through
a
bargaining
--
the
representation
election
by
the
nmb,
if
it's
viewed
that
narrowly,
then
it
is
a
contract
question
and
the
cab
could
have
decided
it.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
no
sir.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
because
the
question
is
really
not
that
limited
before
the
district
court
because
there,
you
do
have
the
representation
questions
which
come
to
bearing.
and
if
the
district
court
had
viewed
it
that
narrowly,
then
what
would
have
happen
to
the
cab
jurisdiction.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
with
respect
to
what?
i'm
frankly
following
one
thing
if
you
said
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
if
your
honor
please,
this
is
the
difficulty
with
the
--
perhaps
stating
the
facts,
so
the
piecemeal
of
the
fact
was
that
these
employees
became
--
this
union
became
a
minority
union,
a
unit
for
only
a
minority
of
the
craft
or
class.
now
this
was
part
of
the
fact
before
--
brought
before
the
district
court
and
that
indicated
that
under
the
railway
labor
act,
this
union
could
not
maintain
this
action.
this
requires
my
discussion
of
the
other
basis
for
our
attack
on
jurisdiction.
we
actually
based
it
on
three
points.
one
was
that
they
were
not
justiciable.
second,
that
in
any
event,
there
was
no
federal
jurisdiction
because
of
the
301
difference
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
third,
because
of
the
position
of
the
cab.
now
the
cab,
i
not
only
concede
but
i
assert
could
have
imposed
this
essay
condition
of
the
merger
or
it
could
have
said
it
will
not
be
effective.
but
it
was
a
different
kind
of
dispute
when
brought
in
the
court
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
was
this
overriding
representation
problem
arising
out
of
its
minority
status
in
the
conflict
of
jurisdiction
with
the
international
association
of
machinists.
this
couldn't
be
--
couldn't
be
avoided.
now,
if
the
cab
had
acted
and
had
said,
you
must
assume
this
contract,
we
would
have
been
free,
not
to
go
ahead
with
the
merger.
this
is
one
of
the
choices
available
to
us.
i
would
--
now,
i
could
shift
to
the
other
basis
of
the
301,
204
jurisdictional
argument
if
the
court
please.
in
the
wiley
case
that
was
held,
that
the
fact
that
the
wiley
union
became
a
minority
representative
after
the
merger,
did
not
foreclose
it
from
bringing
an
action
to
enforcing
arbitration
provisions
of
the
contract
and
it
based
it
on
an
interpretation
of
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
there
simply
is
no
comparable
provision
under
the
railway
labor
act.
now,
the
difficulty
is
that
prior
to
the
enactment
of
section
301,
it
was
virtually
impossible
for
a
national
labor
organization
to
maintain
a
federal
action
or
to
be
sued
in
a
federal
court
because
its
jurisdiction
for
diversity
purposes
would
depend
on
the
citizenship
of
each
of
its
members.
and
since
any
national
union
has
members
in
virtually
every
state,
it
was
--
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
ever
find
a
diversity
suit.
and
so
301
was
amended,
was
added
up
to
the
statute,
in
order
to
enable
contracts
to
be
brought
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
against
unions
and
also
allow
unions
to
maintain
suits,
and
that
was
what
led
to
the
various
kinds
of
litigation
before
this
court
on
the
various
arbitration
cases.
but
section
20
--
but
in
wiley,
it
was
said
that
the
fact
that
the
union
lost
its
majority
status,
did
not
mean
that
it
could
not
maintain
a
301
action
and
it's
cited
retail
clerks
versus
lion
dry
goods.
and
in
that
case,
what
the
court
said
was
that
301
refers
to
representatives
of
employees,
it
does
not
say
majority
representatives,
because
if
--
the
court
said
if
it
intended
that,
it
would
have
referred
to
the
section
1(a),
which
is
the
means
of
providing
for
majority
representatives
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
but
section
204,
on
which
jurisdiction
has
asserted
here
by
the
united
states,
states
that
it
will
be
that
system
boards
will
be
established
by
representatives
of
employees
designated
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
this
title.
and
the
only
way
you
can
designate
a
representative
is
through
a
bargaining
elect
--
representation
election
by
which
a
majority
representative
is
selected
for
the
entire
craft
or
class.
now,
after
the
merger,
this
union
lost
its
status
as
the
representative
for
the
entire
craft
or
class,
it
makes
no
claim
that
it
represents
the
entire
craft
or
class
at
this
point.
it
only
represents
those
employees
who
are
formally
employed
by
capital,
that's
the
sole
basis
for
its
assertion
at
this
point.
now
to
say
that,
because
it
was
originally
designated
as
a
majority
representative,
that
status
therefore
continues
--
creates
some
other
statutory
problems
because
section
211
which
contains
comparable
language
and
says
that
employees
selected
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
this
act
may
enter
into
agreements
requiring
employees
to
become
members
of
labor
organizations
would
also
carry
over
here
because
here,
we
had
a
union
security
agreement
which
was
negotiated
in
capital
and
would
carry
over
to
united,
would
we
say
that
because
this
union
security
agreement
was
originally
entered
into
it
at
that
time
that
the
brotherhood
was
the
majority
representative
that
therefore,
it
will
continue
at
united.
would
this
mean
that
new
employees
hired
at
united
for
example
who
were
in
the
clerk
of
craft
or
class,
would
be
required
to
join
brotherhood?
or
would
it
mean
that
the
530
or
the
2700
employees
who
formally
worked
at
capital,
must
continue
to
maintain
their
membership?
now,
when
we
posed
these
problems
in
our
brief,
we
got
two
different
answers
from
the
brotherhood.
when
we
said
that
you
have
showed
no
way
in
which
an
employee
could
have
been
hurt
here
because
of
the
improved
working
conditions,
so
what
is
your
complaint?
their
response
was,
“well,
we
have
rights
too,
we
as
the
union,
there
is
a
union
security
clause
here.
we
have
a
right
under
that.”
but
then
what
we
said
to
them,
“he
would
certainly
wouldn't
suggest
that
we
arbitrate
whether
or
not
you
would
require
employees
to
continue
to
maintain
their
membership
in
the
brotherhood
after
the
merger,
or
that
new
employees
would
become
members
of
the
brotherhood.”
their
response
is,
“we
are
not
talking
about
membership
but
we're
talking
about
employee
rights.”
you
see
you
would
get
a
shifting
argument
here
when
you
focus
in
on
the
fact
that
nobody
has
been
hurt,
the
answer
is,
“well,
maybe
the
union
has
been
hurt.”
but
when
you
say,
but
the
union
certainly
can't
assert
that
it
can
force
employees
to
join
the
union
after
the
merger,
when
it
no
longer
is
the
majority
collective
bargaining
representative
says,
“well,
we're
not
talking
about
that
at
all.
we're
talking
about
the
employee
contract
rights.”
and
this
is
--
one
of
the
anomalies
of
the
case
here
is
that
usually
when
one
is
asserting
that
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
ought
to
survive,
the
usual
situation
is
that
the
employees
are
better
off
forth.
they
have
gained
something
as
a
result.
but
the
congress
is
true
here,
because
if
in
fact
this
contract
were
to
be
imposed
on
united,
united
could
insist
on
reducing
the
vacations,
insist
on
paying
reduced
wages
and
the
thing
just
become
an
absolute
anomaly.
now,
this
is
the
difficulty
with
the
position
as
i
see
it
that
the
government
is
asserting
here,
they
asked
this
court
to
direct
united
to
arbitrate
these
matters.
but
what
is
there
to
arbitrate,
are
you
to
give
us
a
general
direction
to
arbitrate
anything
that
might
come
up
in
the
future
either
say
anything
any
contract
provision
is
to
be
arbitrated
or
are
we
to
talk
about
specific
clients?
a
specific
employee
grievance
that
this
happened
to
me
on
such
a
day
and
therefore,
i
want
some
relief.
but
where
is
that?
where
is
that,
it
simply
isn't
in
this
case.
now
there
are
general
allegations
that
some
grievances
were
filed
and
that
we
refused
--
pardon?
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
if
your
honor
please,
these
have
not
been
identified
in
the
complaint.
all
that
the
complaint
says
that
the
entire--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
--
the
entire
thing
survives.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
i
say
that
when
you
compel
arbitration,
this
court
has
always
said
that
the
court
not
only
finds
that
the
obligation
to
arbitrate
is
present
but
also
that
the
issues
are
arbitrable.
i
asked
whether
the
arbitrable
issues
now.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
but
you
see
sir,
the
difficulty
i
have
with
that
is,
for
example
what
terms
will
the
union
suggest
that
the
vacation
clause
of
the
brotherhood
agreement
survived,
when
it's
inferior
to
the
vacation
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
again,
i
have
--
this
is
my
problem.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
there
are
an
infinite
number
of
kinds
of
things
one
could
conjure
up
that
you
should
say
should
be
arbitrated
under
this.
now,
is
the
court
to
direct
a
general
kind
of
arbitration
of
anything
that
the
union
suggests,
and
this
puts
us
into
another
position.
mr.
highsaw
said
the
contract
here
did
not
expire
and
continues
from
year-to-year.
if
the
contract
is
terminable
on
30
days
notice
by
its
terms
and
has
been
since
february
of
1962,
so
that
if
united
had
acted
out
over
an
abundance
of
caution,
i
suppose
it
might
have
terminated
the
contract
in
february
1962
saying
that
we
don't
agree,
we're
bombed
and
in
any
event
we're
terminating
it.
what
this
would
mean
is
that
if
we
were
directed
to
arbitrate
there
would
be
nothing
to
prevent
us
from
not
giving
30
days
notice
to
terminate
this
contract
and
then
what
are
we
left
with?
if
no
employee
grievances
have
come
up
now,
to
this
point,
then
what
is
to
be
arbitrated?
what
i
am
simply
suggesting
mr.
justice
white
is
i
don't
know
how
we
can
be
directed
to
arbitrate
issues
which
haven't
been
identified
and
this
was
a
point
made
in
the
wiley
case
incidentally
when
it
was
pointed
out
that
a
union
could
abandon
its
claim
to
arbitrate
by
not
identifying
them
for
example.
now
here,
not
only
has
the
claim
has
not
been
identified
but
as
i
say
the
only
--
i
think
the
only
thing
that
i
could
think
of
in
which
an
employee
might
have
had
a
grievance
was
for
discriminatory
discharge
or
dismissal,
arbitrary
dismissal
or
something
of
that
kind,
because
the
ordinary
working
conditions
are
superior
as
i
pointed
out
under
the
united
arrangement.
but
no
such
thing
has
happened
and
no
such
thing
has
been
alleged,
there
is
no
claim
of
that
kind
in
this
record.
when
the
court
directed
that
--
let's
go
back
and
see
if
there
has
been
any
kind
of
arbitrary
action.
if
you
find
some
and
if
you
want
to
arbitrate
them,
then
arbitrate
them.
could
we
arbitrate
that?
if
the
union
can
arbitrate,
can
we
say,
“alright,
we
want
the
extra
money
back.
we
paid
you
fellows
$225
or
more.
we
want
that
money
back.”
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
i'm
sorry.
i
do
not
believe
it
is.
and
i'm
not
going
to
be
evasive
about
this
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
if
i
win
the
530
employees
were
placed
under
the
machinist
contract
at
united
which
conflicted
with
the
brotherhood
contract,
united
did
invite
them
--
the
brotherhood
answers
--
talk
to
them
about
the
integration
of
the
seniority
of
these
employees.
and
they
refuse
to
do
so.
it's
a
matter
of
record
here.
and
it's
one
thing
that
can
draw
possibilities,
but
this
is
what
did
happen
in
fact.
and
in
fact
what
happened
is
that
in
november
of
1960,
capital
met
with
brotherhood
and
said
to
it,
“what
do
you
propose
as
conditions
to
be
applied
after
the
merger?
that
is,
what
you
think
the
protections
ought
to
be?”
and
because
capital
could
not
guarantee
that
united
would
go
along
with
what
was
agreed
on,
the
brotherhood
refused
to
say
anything.
now,
they
convert
this
into
a
statement
that
capital
said,
“united
won't
be
bound
by
anything
we
agreed
too,”
but
that
is
not
what
was
said.
what
was
said
was,
that
we
can't
guarantee
that
and
it
may
well
be
that
if
cap
--
if
the
brotherhood
come
up
with
specific
suggestions,
these
would
have
been
completely
acceptable,
but
they
never
did.
i
hesitate
to
scribe
motivation
here,
your
honor.
this
is
what
drives
me
back
to
the
fact
and
i
think
this
really
is
ultimately
a
representation
dispute.
you
get
this
pattern
of
coming
up
to
the
--
to
the
threshold
and
backing
off.
you
meet
with
capital.
and
capital
says,
“well
what
are
your
proposals?”
well
you
say
that
you
can't
guarantee
that
united
will
take
them,
so
we
won't
tell
you,”
and
then
they
back
off.
we
get
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it
looks
like
they're
going
to
have
to
file
a
brief
and
get
a
decision
on
this
thing
and
incidentally,
there
was
a
decision
in
the
early
1962,
get
back
off
and
start
over
again.
but
what
is
the
reason
for
this
procrastination,
this
expansion
of
litigation.
then
i
would
submit
it's
an
order
to
assist
the
general
organizing
campaign
that's
going
on
to
organizing
the
entire
group
of
employees
at
united,
the
13,000
of
them.
and
--
but
for
the
litigation
that
mr.
cox
referred
to
which
is
now
before
this
court,
which
will
be
argued
i
think
sometime
in
january,
that
election
would
have
been
held
a
long
time
ago.
and
i
would
guess
that
once
the
election
would
have
been
held,
then
brotherhood
wouldn't
have
abandoned
this
action
as
it
has
a
real
action
along
the
way.
it
went
to
the
mediation
board
two
weeks
after
the
district
court
dismissed
this
complaint.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
if
they
didn't
win,
i
suppose
that
somebody
else
might
have
a
say
about
the
matter.
i
think
once
the
election
was
held
that
would
have
had
ended.
because
i
think
the
stakes
are
rather
high
and
bargaining
group
of
13,000
is
considerably
more
significant
than
2700.
otherwise,
i
don't
know
how
you
can
explain
the
conduct
of
getting
this
case
before
the
court
of
appeals,
for
the
district
of
columbia.
and
every
issue
that
could
have
been
raised
in
this
proceeding
in
the
district
court,
and
then
just
when
you're
going
to
get
the
briefing,
you
dismissed
and
three
days
later,
start
all
over
again.
i
can
see
nothing
in
it
but
delay.
i
have
nothing
further,
if
the
court
please,
with
respect
to
this
matter.
it
seems
to
me
that
when
we're
all
done
with
it,
the
employees
are
in
the
peculiar
position
of
being
better
off
before
--
because
they
lost
their
contract.
i
will
concede
that
there
are
many
advantages
to
having
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
on
your
behalf.
that's
protection
against
arbitrary
action.
it's
a
protection
against
many
things
but
these
didn't
happen.
and
i
don't
think
we
can
direct
arbitration
here
on
the
assumption
that
might
have
happened
but
they
didn't
happen.
the
employees
are
far
better
off
here
because
of
the
result.
and
if
the
contract
is
directed
to
be
imposed
on
united
as
brotherhood
suggest,
employees
will
suffer.
for
if
we'd
arbitrate,
i
don't
know
what
were
to
arbitrate,
because
maybe
we
wouldn't
want
to
arbitrate
some
of
the
reductions
as
well
as
some
of
the
improvements.
for
that
reason,
i
think
that
the
general
posture
here
your
honor,
is
that
there
was
no
ultimate
federal
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
there
was
no
--
not
a
justiciable
issue
because
what
is
at
the
bottom
here
is
a
representation
of
dispute
over
the
bargaining
rights
for
13,000
employees,
all
the
united
employees
in
this
craft
or
class.
i
don't
see
how
a
craft
or
class
for
less
on
the
entire
group
at
a
--
at
an
airline
under
the
railway
labor
act
just
we
have
set
it
out
in
our
brief
could
claim
any
rights
under
the
railway
labor
act.
there's
action
of
anything,
if
it
was
justiciable
at
all
would
have
to
be
based
on
diversity.
and
there
simply
is
no
diverse
up
here
--
diversity
here
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
alleged
in
the
complaint.
because
this
is
a
voluntary,
unincorporated
association
and
i'm
certain
that
there
are
members
you
know
in
delaware
where
united
is
incorporated,
in
illinois
where
united
has
its
principal
place
of
business.
thank
you
very
much.
