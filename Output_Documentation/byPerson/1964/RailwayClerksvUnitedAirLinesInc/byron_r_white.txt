justice
byron
r.
white
federal
district
court
decided
that
if
it
survives
at
all,
is
that
a
need
to
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
could
be
arbitrary?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
that
the
question
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
that
is
so,
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
argument
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
been
done
in
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
or
whether
it's
practiced?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
that
the
case
here
does
involve
both
--
whether
both
of
the
parties
(inaudible)
the
other.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
mean
here
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
contract
does
--
does
continue
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
it
had
said
or
we
agree
with
the
union
that
--
let's
say,
in
the
case
of
these
533
people,
we
agree,
we're
going
to
impose
this
condition
of
the
merger
that
the
530
people
will
be
represented
by
the
union.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
there's
another
union
in
the
picture
for
the
balance
of
those
machinists.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
cab
could
make
that
sort
of
a
provision
or
could
have
said
expressly
that
the
--
this
collective
bargaining
contract
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
expires
in
its
entirety?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
ever
heard
of
cab
terminating
collective
bargaining
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
cab
then
needn't
all
consider
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
mediation
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
there
is
a
representation
of
dispute
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
there
is,
there
was
before
the
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
it's
enough
of
a
label
for
you
to
claim
that
the
district
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
didn't,
why
would
the
cab?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
and
so
for
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
agree
essentially
--
you
agree
with
the
--
would
you
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
there
as
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
says
that
you
should
view
it
as
effective
this
interim
period.
but
this
case
involved
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
--
at
least
it's
got
jurisdiction
to
determine
what
is
going
to
happen
during
this
interim
period.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
might
have
written
the
claim
and
not
on
the
--
as
to
particularly
wrong
to
particular
employee
but
there
is
a
claim
that
--
that
(a),
the
arbitration
clause
survived
and
(b),
some
other
provisions
of
the
contract
survived.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you're
saying
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you're
saying
is
that
there's
no
case
of
controversy
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
survival
of
the
other
terms
in
the
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
says
the
entire
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
explain
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
if
the
union
goes
into
the
--
to
the
surviving
employer
like
the
union
--
the
capital
union
goes
to
united's
--
the
united
personnel
manager
or
president
right
after
the
merger,
it
says
i
want
to
sit
down
and
talk
to
you
about
the
situation
of
these
500
fellows
--
these
500
in
phoenix
and
their
status
under
this
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
united
says,
“now,
go
on.
get
out
of
here,”
that
contract's
dead.
long
dead.
i
don't
want
to
talk
you
at
all.
i
won't
talk
to
you.”
and
he
says,
“well,
you've
got
to
talk
to
them,”
in
the
union,
in
the
unite
says
--
a
fellow
says,
“well,
what's
your
specific
problem?”
alright,
“that
isn't
the
question.
my
question
is,
we
represent
these
500
people.
we
want
to
make
sure
that
we
had
an
arrangement
with
the
united
--
with
the
capital
people
having
to
handle
grievances
and
things
like
that.
i
just
want
to
talk
to
you
about
it,
make
sure
we
understand
each
other.”
“now
get
out
of
here.”
and
the
union
goes
to
court
and
says
--
it
says,
“i
want
the
arbitrator
to
decide
whether
this
contract
survives,
whether
any
or
all
of
it
survives,
and
whether
we
really
are
the
bargaining
representatives
for
this
people
or
not.”
isn't
that
specific
enough
for
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
who's
brief
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
then
say
that
the
board
could
have
dispose
that
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
they
did
have
the
power
to
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
think
it
was
a
--
do
you
think
it
was
right
that
they
didn't?
i
mean,
was
it
permissible
if
they
did
not
dispose
off
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you're
saying,
you
don't
--
you
say
the
board
could
leave
this
matter
unresolved
although
it
had
the
power
to
get
a
hold
of
it,
then
you
don't
rest
your
argument
that
they
didn't
or
shouldn't
deal
with
it
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
mediation
board
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
if
they
had
--
they
shouldn't
have
just
left
it
alone
just
out
of
deference
to
the
national
mediation
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
do
you
want
the
--
what
do
you
think
the
arbitrator
under
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
(voice
overlap)
issue
before
the
arbitrator?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
know.
what
if
the
court
says
that
it
won't
decide
that,
then
what
would
you
like?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
all
we
decide
is
the
--
is
that
the
arbitration
clause
survives,
then
what
are
you
going
to
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
court
doesn't
say
it,
all
they've
decided
is
this,
that
the
arbitration
clause
survives
and
the
court
and
the
court
below
has
jurisdiction
to
order
arbitration
about
something.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
else
do
you
want
except
to
protect
the
rights
of
employees?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
at
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
court
determined
that
the
arbitration
clause
survives
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
that
grievances
were
arbitrable
under
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
if
there
were
any
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
then
all
--
you
wait
towards
grievance,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
else
can
you
do
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
if
the
grievances
--
you've
got
some
grievances
in
that
--
that
are
filed
and
you
wanted
to
bring
them
up
why
you
bring
them
up.
and
the
company
might
say,
“well
who
has
arrived
under
a
clause
of
the
contract
but
didn't
survive?”
well
you
might
say
“well
that's
also
a
question
for
the
arbitrator
along
with
the
merits
of
this
grievance.”
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
mr.
bernstein's
suggestion
that
the
--
you
really
don't
have
anything
concrete
to
any
rights
of
employees
that
you're
worried
about
or
to
object
too
or
to
try
to
protect
but
that
you
--
this
is
really
a
representation
question
that
you've
let
--
this
litigation
as
part
of
your
“it
might
represent
13,000”.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
give
me
an
example.
justice
byron
r.
white
automatic
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
asked
united
ever
to
--
to
bargain
about
any
of
these
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
on
this
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
why
wouldn't
this
be
just
a
--
just
dandy
subjects
than
normal
subjects
for
an
arbitrator.
