did
that
provision
put
them
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
for
the
first
time
in
1959?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
shows
that?
justice
potter
stewart
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
the
reason
why
it
was
permitted.
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
why
--
couldn't
it
have
obtained
in
the
court
of
appeals
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
the
civil
aeronautics
board
should
have
passed
on
your
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then,
what
you're
saying
now
is
that
the
board
clearly
decided
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
did
not
survive.
justice
potter
stewart
that
board
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
is
argued
that
this
is
a
matter
which
you
--
your
remedy
in
these
proceedings
within
the
court
of
appeals
--
the
assessment.

district
of
columbia
that
time.
justice
potter
stewart
i
still
don't
quite
understand
why,
why
you
couldn't
have
claimed
that
the
duty
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
you're
not
making
that
argument.
here,
you're
making
argument
that
this
contract
survived
as
a
matter
of
law
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
not
within
the
voluntary
discretion
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
civil
aeronautics
board.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
not
a
matter
of
discretion
if
you're
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what's
the
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
you
don't
(inaudible)
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
it
did
impose
protective
conditions.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
go
on.
justice
potter
stewart
if
this
bargaining
agreement
did
survive,
is
it
still
in
effect?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
effect,
the
brotherhood
is
not,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
this
--
this
collect
--
this
agreement
setup
a
system
adjustment
board?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
capital?
justice
potter
stewart
on
whose
behalf
that
you'd
be
bargaining?
justice
potter
stewart
why
not
the
530
who
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they're
covered
by
this
agreement,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
why
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
you're
writing
a
basic
provision
that
was
a
violation
of
this
agreement,
wasn't
it?
