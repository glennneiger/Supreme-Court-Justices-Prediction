mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government's
interest
in
this
case
is
chiefly
through
the
national
mediation
board.
the
agency
which
was
held
we
think
wrongly,
by
the
courts
below
to
have
exclusive
jurisdiction.
the
mediation
board
also
has
a
general
concern
with
labor
relations
in
the
airlines
industry
and
of
course,
a
general
concern
with
the
interpretation
and
the
administration
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
applies
to
the
airlines
as
well
as
the
railroads.
our
position
here
is
that
the
district
court
did
have
jurisdiction
to
declare
united's
obligation
to
submit
to
an
adjustment
board
which
is
created
by
this
contract
any
claims
that
united
was
violating
the
rights
of
the
employees
under
the
clerk's
agreement
with
the
capital.
but
that
the
district
court
is
obliged
to
stay
at
hand
in
passing
and
not
pass
on
the
substance
of
any
of
those
claims
in
favor
of
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
adjustment
board
created
by
the
contract.
to
be
a
little
more
precise,
we
agree
with
the
clerks
that
the
courts
below
were
wrong
in
holding
that
this
was
a
representation
dispute
and
therefore,
not
justiciable.
we
also
agree
with
the
clerks
essentially,
i
think,
on
the
proposition
that
the
wiley
case
establishes
the
obligation
of
the
--
of
united,
the
acquiring
corporation
to
submit
disputes
arising
under
the
contract
with
the
acquired
cooperation
to
arbitration,
which
is
essentially
the
same
here
as
submitting
them
to
an
adjustment
board
because
there's
no
real
difference
with
this
case
between
the
two.
on
the
other
hand,
we
part
company
with
the
petitioner.
i'm
not
sure
that
we
get
in
company
with
the
united
but
we
part
company
with
petitioner.
in
thinking
that
they
--
the
district
court
should
not
grant
any
further
relief
than
that
because
we
think
the
questions
that
arise
concerning
the
substantive
rights
of
the
employees
under
this
contract
are
questions
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
adjustment
board.
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
take
if
the
question
whether
the
contract
survives
at
all,
is
a
question
of
substantive
law
that
the
district
court
could
decide.
i
would
think
it
having
them
argued,
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court
to
go
ahead
and
decide
it
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
--
mr.
archibald
cox
what?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'd
--
when
i
said
was
the
contract
survived
at
all,
i
perhaps
should
have
drawn
a
dis
--
should
not
have
spoken
so
broadly.
i
think
whether
the
arbitration
clause
survives
and
binds
united
is
a
justiciable
question
and
it's
clearly
so
under
the
wiley
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
then
i
read
the
wiley,
you
--
assume
the
court
decides
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
then
i
read
the
wiley
case
as
indicating
that
it
is
open
to
the
arbitrator
to
consider
whether
the
merger
has
resulted
in
such
changes
in
circumstances
and
so
other
practice,
that
some
are
all
of
the
substantive
obligations
under
the
contract
have
expired.
and
when
i
said
the
contract,
in
answer
to
your
question
justice
white,
i
really
was
thinking
only
of
the
arbitration
clause.
the
rest
is
where
the
adjustment
board
under
our
view.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
agreement
setup
the
equivalent
of
a
system
adjustment
board.
that's
the
fact
that
i
did
want
to
emphasize.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
appears
on
--
begins
on
page
31
justice
stewart,
sets
up
in
article
31,
a
method
for
the
adjustment
of
grievances.
you'll
note
a
duly
accredited
representative
who
believes
any
provision
of
this
agreement
has
been
or
has
not
been
properly
applied
or
interpreted
shall
have
the
right
to
take
it
up
through
the
procedure.
and
then
the
provisions
for
the
board
of
adjustment
are
over
on
page
32
and
it
sets
up
the
equivalent
of
the
railroad
system
board
of
adjustment.
indeed,
i
guess
they
use
that
name
in
the
airlines
also.
i'd
like
to
deal
first
with
the
ruling
below
and
then
come
on
to
our
views
about
the
exclusive
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
adjustment
board.
the
question
of
jurisdiction
here
obviously
turns
upon
what
is
in
issue,
what
is
drawn
in
issue
by
the
complaint
in
this
particular
case.
there's
no
arguing
of
the
fact
that
there
is
in
the
picture,
the
labor
relations
picture
of
united
airlines
and
its
relations
with
these
unions.
there
are
a
number
of
questions
of
representations
of
the
clerk's
claim
to
be
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
and
that's
disputed.
there
are
disputes
concerning
the
particular
crafts
or
classes
that
are
appropriate.
there
is
a
possibility
that
the
clerks
of
machinists
are
claiming
overlapping
jurisdiction.
all
those
questions
undoubtedly
exist
and
some
of
them
are
before
this
court,
in
cases
in
which
the
writ
was
granted
two
weeks
ago.
but
none
of
those
issues
as
i
read
the
complaint
are
involved
in
the
present
case,
which
is
concerned
exclusively
with
rights
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
rights
unaffected
by
any
question
of
representation.
the
heart
of
the
present
case
if
i
read
the
complaint
right,
is
in
paragraph
18
of
the
complaint,
on
page
8
of
the
record.
after
referring
to
the
merger,
the
complaint
then
says
that
carrier,
meaning
united,
has
refused
to
apply
the
terms
of
such
agreement
to
any
of
these
employees
or
to
recognize
any
of
the
rights
of
any
of
these
employees
there
under.
then
it
lists
things
like
seniority,
basis
of
pay,
handling
of
grievances,
dscipline
and
the
rest,
as
the
kind
of
rights
involved.
and
then
each
subsequent
paragraph
of
the
complaint
goes
on
and
complains
of
united's
refusal
to
apply
the
provisions
of
the
agreement
to
any
of
the
employees
of
capital,
for
four
or
five
paragraphs.
then
over
in
paragraph
23,
it
refers
specifically
to
the
refusal
to
accept
to
process
grievances
in
accordance
with
the
procedures
that
i
mentioned
earlier.
the
complaint
certainly
does
not
expressly
raise
any
questions
of
representation
nor
does
the
relief
directly
as
requested
invite
any
declaration
or
determination
with
respect
to
any
question
of
representation.
there's
no
claim
made
by
the
brotherhood
here
that
it
is
today
the
exclusive
representative
of
any
employees
as
i
understand.
there's
no
claim
made
here
of
the
right
to
be
the
representative
in
the
future
as
i
read
the
complaint.
nor
does
it
seem
to
me
that
this
case
indirectly
turns
upon
any
question
of
representation,
or
at
least
any
relied
question
of
representation.
certainly,
there's
no
challenge
to
the
fact
that
the
clerks
were
the
representative
at
the
time
this
contract
was
executed.
well,
that's
admitted.
if
that
were
drawn
in
question,
that'd
be
another
case,
but
it
couldn't
be
drawn
in
question.
they
had
a
certification
at
the
time
and
the
contract
itself
recites
that
they
were
then
the
representative.
the
status
of
the
contract
today
does
not,
as
i
understand
it,
depend
in
anyway
upon
whether
the
clerks,
is
today,
the
majority
representative.
under
the
railway
labor
act,
it
has
been
the
recognized
view
of
everyone
concerned
for
30
years.
as
mr.
highsaw
points
out
in
his
reply
brief,
that
even
a
change
in
the
identity
of
the
representative
does
not
automatically
terminate
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
the
question
that's
often
debated
about
what
effect
in
nlrb
certification
has
on
the
existing
agreement,
doesn't
arise
under
the
railway
labor
act.
there's
a
different
--
different
problem
here,
because
in
the
railway
industry
as
a
result
of
statutes,
of
contract
continue
indefinitely
until
they
are
terminated
under
the
terms
of
the
statute
or
i
suppose
otherwise
by
operation
of
law,
but
they're
not
for
a
fix
terms
and
then
they
may
automatically
lose
their
course.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
statute,
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that
the
statute
says
anything
about,
without
regard
to
the
laws
of
representation.
the
statute
just
speaks
of
the
duty
to
make
it
maintain
and
then
prescribes
a
procedure
for
changing
the
status
quo.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
not
been
litigated.
you'll
find
that
in
mr.
highsaw's
replied
brief
of
quotation
from
the
mediation
board
summarizing
its
30
years
of
practice.
you
will
also
find
a
similar
statement
in
the
first
annual
report
of
the
national
mediation
board
at
pages
23
and
24.
and
i
think
i
am
right
in
saying
that
this
has
always
been
an
accepted
principle,
certainly
among
the
railroads
of
the
brotherhood
and
i
had
supposed
that
it's
been
carried
over
into
the
airline.
mr.
archibald
cox
only
that
the
litigation
that's
held
it
up
has
now
reached
this
court
because
certiorari
has
been
granted.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
the
same
one.
but
that
that
i
am
arguing,
that
the
validity
of
this
contract
and
the
obligations
under
this
contract
until
some
steps
are
taken
to
terminating
are
not
in
anyway
dependent
on
the
results
of
that
election.
we
say
here
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
once
--
not
quite
there.
once
the
election
is
held
and
a
representative
is
designated
and
the
representative
takes
the
required
statutory
steps
to
bring
about
a
change
in
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
then
this
case
will
be
terminated.
and
the
real
issue
here
is,
we
tried
to
suggest
in
our
brief,
is
what
is
the
effect
of
this
contract
during
this
period
before
a
new
representative
is
designated,
and
he
begins
negotiating
as
he
unquestionably
will
a
new
contract
by
giving
the
notices
required
by
the
statute
so
forth.
i
suggest
that
if
a
change
in
the
representative
does
not
deprive
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
of
its
validity,
then
a
fortiori,
the
mere
loss
of
a
majority
or
possible
loss
of
a
majority
would
not
have
the
effect
of
terminating
the
existing
collecting
bargaining
agreement.indeed,
i
doubt
to
whether
that's
true
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
i
don't
think
anybody
has
ever
suggested
that
a
defense
to
a
suit
to
compel
arbitration
would
be
to
show
that
the
union
no
longer
represents
the
majority
of
the
employee
which
is
all
that
could
be
claimed
here.
so
that
we
say
this
is
simply
a
suit.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
know
of
any
decision.
i
don't
know.
mr.
archibald
cox
no
one
has
ever
raised
it.
i
know
that
--
i've
said
--
no
one's
ever
raised
it
either
way.
i
know
i've
said
and
i
guess
hundreds
of
arbitrations
where
nobody
ever
came
in
and
said,
“well,
that
the
union
is
no
longer
--
we
want
an
election
to
determine
whether
the
union
is
a
representative
of
the
majority
before
you
conduct
this
arbitration.”
the
contract
doesn't
make
any
such
expressed
provision.
the
wiley
case
of
course,
necessarily
implies
the
contrary.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
was
a
contract
but
that's
what's
being
sued
to
enforce
here
as
a
contract.
i
think
the
wiley
case
mr.
justice,
necessarily
implies
the
contrary
because
there
were
only
one-seventh,
the
number
of
employees
covered
by
the
contract
that
there
were
at
the
bigger
concern
that
acquired
it
and
it's
exceedingly
unlikely
that
the
union
was
the
majority
representative
of
the
whole
group.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
recess,
i
was
arguing
that
this
case
not
only
directly
involved
in
a
claim
of
exclusive
bargaining
rights,
but
also
that
it
did
not
indirectly
raise
any
question
of
representation.
there
is
one
little
wrinkle
that
i
think
i
should
mention
that
may
perhaps
be
more
complicated
in
the
presentation
i've
made
thus
far.
the
--
included
in
this
group
of
2700
capital
employees
that
were
represented
by
the
clerks
and
moved
over
to
united,
where
530
in
classes
that
are
often
represented
by
machinist.
and
apparently
after
the
merger,
those
530
were
integrated
in
with
the
united's
own
machinists
and
if
i
read
the
record
right,
were
also
put
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
united
and
the
machinists.
now,
i
can
--
one
of
the
difficulties
here
is,
i
think,
is
when
we
talk
about
the
contract
as
a
lump
really
that
claims
here
i
would
think
is
where
a
mass
of
specific
claims
that
might
arise
under
the
contract.
and
i
can't
imagine
one
of
those
specific
claims
arising,
on
the
claim
of
a
former
capital
machinist
saying
that
this
could
--
he
was
being
denied
rights
under
the
capital
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
united
replied,
while
you
come
under
the
clerks
agreement,
and
you
thereby
surrendered
your
rights
under
the
old
capital
agreement,”
and
his
reply,
“well,
i
didn't
intentionally
waved
them,
and
the
machinist
had
no
right
to
put
me
under
their
agreement
or
to
bargain
that
sort
of
the
change
in
my
previous
rights
under
the
capital
agreement.”
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
was
--
oh,
you
mean
whether
they
by
joining
specifically
did
give.
well,
the
question
is
whether
they
joined
voluntarily.
if
they
joined
voluntarily,
there
might
have
been
a
personal
waiver.
if
they
don't
join
voluntarily,
then
i
suppose
it
would
be
a
claim
whether
the
union
had
the
right
to
put
them
in
under
there
without
their
consent.
i'm
coming
to
think
of
a
way
in
which
a
question
of
representation
conceivably
could
grow
out
of
this.
and
the
only
one
i
could
think
of
is
then.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
the
machinist
agreement
there
is,
yes.
and
apparently,
they've
been
compelled
to
comply
with
it.
if
such
a
claim
were
made
and
if
the
individual
machinist
should
attempt
to
say
that
the
machinist
union
had
no
right
to
give
up
his
rights
under
the
capital
agreement,
that
that
was
beyond
its
powers,
the
bargaining
representative,
then
i
think
there
would
be
something
that
might
be
called
a
question
of
representation.
it
would
seem
to
me,
however,
two
things,
one
that
that
is
too
remote
from
the
present
controversy,
too
iffy,
there
are
too
many
contingencies
that
might
be
the
sort
of
personal
waiver
that
mr.
justice
white
suggests.
the
case
may
never
arise.
furthermore,
it
involves
only
about
one-fifth
of
all
the
employees
who
might
have
rights
under
this
contract
anyway.
and
i
suggest
that
in
terms
of
whether
this
whole
case
raises
the
dispute
of
representation
that
would
be
to
have
the
tail
wag
the
dog.
and
that
that
defense
could
be
raised
at
an
appropriate
time
where
any
individual
machinist
made
a
claim
or
a
claim
was
made
on
his
behalf.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
was
what
i
tried
--
that
was
what
i
tried
to
suggest
when
i
said
that
it
would
be
to
allow
the
tail
to
wag
the
dog,
that
the
bigger
part
of
the
case
would
not
be
involved
in
this
problem.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
you
might
--
you
might.
well,
i
would
suggest
that
even
as
to
the
530
that
it's
too
iffy,
too
far
varied
to
be
--
to
say
at
this
stage
it
is
a
representation
dispute
even
as
to
them.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
they
claim
it
in
this
case.
whether
they
claim
it
in
the
proceedings
before
the
mediation
board,
i
would
have
to
leave
to
them
to
say.
i
couldn't
speak
as
to
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
it's
--
i
guess
they've
put
it
in
both
ways.
they've
said,
even
if
they've
put
the
claim
in
general
terms
and
i
suppose
it
applies
to
the
530.
they
also
say
even
if
we're
wrong
as
to
530,
we
are
right
as
to
the
others.
now,
taking
what
i've
said
thus
far
as
predicate,
i
turn
more
precisely
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
the
legal
problems.
first,
it
seems
to
me
that
federal
jurisdiction
here
is
squarely
positive
upon
28
u.s.c.
section
1331,
an
action
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
where
the
jurisdictional
amount
is
satisfied
and
upon
28
u.s.c.
1337,
where
no
jurisdictional
amount
is
required
an
action
arising
under
a
law
regulating
commerce.
insofar
as
i
can
see,
both
those
points
are
squarely
adjudicated
by
international
association
of
machinists
against
central
airlines
in
372
u.s.682.
now,
united
says
that
that
case
is
distinguishable
because
in
the
present
instance
the
--
excuse
me
--
because
in
the
present
instance,
the
clerks
may
not
have
a
majority.
and
they
say
that
the
railway
labor
act
affects
the
contract
only
if
the
clerks
are
designated
by
a
majority.
but
of
course
the
relevant
section
of
the
railway
labor
act,
section
180
--
section
204,
printed
on
pages
19
and
20
of
my
brief,
does
not
speak
in
terms
of
present
majority
status.
it
speaks
in
terms
of
the
past.
it
says
it
should
be
the
duty
of
every
carrier
and
of
its
employees
acting
through
their
representative,
selected
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
section
2
and
so
on
of
this
title.
the
union
was
so
selective.
it
didn't
have
that
status
at
the
time
the
contract
was
negotiated,
and
that's
all
that
the
statute
requires
it
doesn't
say
about
continuing
the
majority
status
or
continuing
the
selection.
coming
now
to
the
reasoning
of
the
court
below,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
follows
from
what
i've
already
said
that
this
cannot
be
said
to
be
a
nonjusticiable
dispute
over
representation.
certainly,
the
mediation
board
has
no
power
to
resolve
this
controversy
concerning
the
rights
of
employees
or
the
union
to
arbitrate
or
any
other
substantive
rights
under
this
contract.
its
sole
power
is
to
determine
afar
the
future
through
election
machinery
who
will
be
the
representatives
to
negotiate
contracts
in
the
future.
it
has
no
practical
power
or
legal
power
with
respect
to
the
contract
and
its
status
during
the
intervening
period.
the
same
considerations,
i
think,
show
that
this
is
not
a
case
such
as
so
illustrated
by
some
other
cases
in
this
court,
where
the
question
--
where
the
case
involves
a
question
of
representation
and
there
is
nobody
with
power
to
adjudicate.
the
three
cases
relied
on
by
the
courts
below
are
--
i
submit
quite
plainly
distinguishable
of
the
switchmen's
union
case
in
321
u.s.,
was
a
case
in
which
one
union,
the
brt,
sought
to
be
certified
for
unit
made
up
of
all
yardmen
allover
the
new
york
central
system.
the
switchmen's
union
sought
to
be
certified
for
a
unit
--
a
lesser
included
unit,
made
up
of
the
yardmen
in
some
of
yards
of
the
new
york
central
system.
clearly,
the
end
of
the
controversy
was
who
would
be
certified,
the
intermediate
stage
of
the
controversy
would
be
what
would
be
the
applicable
craft
or
class
and
both
of
those
are
questions
you
could
find
in
the
national
mediation
board,
but
something
quite
different
from
the
present
case.
the
general
committee
against
the
katy
railroad
in
320
u.s.
decided
the
same
day,
did
involve
a
dispute
which
i
guess
no
one
had
power
to
adjudicate.
there,
the
issue
was
which
of
two
unions,
the
engineers
or
firemen,
had
authority
to
negotiate
rules
concerning
the
assignment
of
fireman
to
the
job
of
engineer
when
the
engineer
who
held
that
job
failed
to
show
up.
there
were
--
one
contract
was
negotiated
by
the
engineers
then
the
firemen's
union
negotiated
another
contract
and
then
the
engineers
brought
suit
for
a
declaration
that
the
firemen
had
exceeded
their
statutory
authority
in
negotiating
their
contract
on
this
subject.
at
the
court's
opinions
in
this
case
as
well
as
the
briefs,
makes
it
very
clear
that
the
whole
issue
was
in
terms
of
the
statutory
authority
of
the
firemen
to
negotiate
that
contract.
the
case
would
be
conferrable
to
this,
i
think,
if
there
were
any
challenge
to
the
authority
of
the
clerks
who
had
negotiated
this
contract
at
the
time
they
negotiated,
because
there
is
no
such
challenge.
the
point
that
their
authority
at
that
time
is
admitted,
it's
not
in
issue,
and
the
case
is
therefore
distinguishable.
it
seems
to
us,
therefore,
that
the
considerations
i
have
mentioned
do
require
reversal
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
next
question
becomes
should
this
court
then
send
the
matter
back
to
have
all
the
remaining
questions
considered
in
the
courts
below
or
should
some
of
the
other
questions
that
have
been
argued
here,
be
decided
here
in
view
of
the
protracted
character
of
this
litigation.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
it
would
be
appropriate
and
though
it's
obviously
not
essential
for
this
court
to
decide
it.
there
are
two
principles,
i
think,
the
court
should
make
plain
in
its
opinion.
one
is
that
the
obligation
to
submit
the
dispute
to
the
adjustment
board
that
survives
the
merger,
on
that
point,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
wiley
case
is
plainly
controlling.
the
only
attempted
distinction
which
has
i
think
even
the
color
of
merit
is
the
argument
that
the
civil
aeronautics
board
by
providing
this
protective
conditions
occupied
the
field
as
it
were
and
excluded
the
continued
operation
of
the
contract
or
excluded
the
operation
of
the
policy
at
considerations
that
led
to
the
wiley
decision.
but
i
think
the
answer
to
that
really
is
that
the
predictive
conditions
were
not
intended
to
and
do
not
occupy
the
same
field
that
this
collective
bargaining
agreement
occupied.
if
you
look
at
the
conditions
in
section
1
on
page
59
of
the
record,
it
says
that
the
--
it
is
the
intent
that
such
conditions
are
to
be
restricted
to
those
changes
in
employment,
solely
due
to
and
resulting
from
such
merger.
fluctuations
rises
and
falls
of
changes
in
volume
of
character
of
employment
brought
about
solely
by
other
causes
are
not
covered
by
or
intended
to
be
covered
by
this
order.
there
are
many
rights
given
by
this
contract,
which
wholly
apart
and
unrelated
to
things
that
might
happen
from
the
merger.
to
take
the
simplest
case
of
all,
the
claim
that
discipline
or
discharge
is
unjust
because
the
employee
didn't
do
what
he
was
alleged
to
do
or
because
that
is
a
just
cause
for
this
charge,
or
take
a
controversy
over
seniority,
bidding
for
jobs
at
some
point
that
only
capital
served
and
to
which
no
new
employees
have
been
transferred.
one
can
think
of
any
number
of
things
which
would
protect
employees
under
this
agreement,
that
the
protective
conditions
being
concerned
with
the
displacement
of
employees
and
loss
of
jobs
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
now,
we
do
think
--
again,
really
following
the
analogy
of
the
wiley
case
that
the
substantive
rights
under
this
contract
are
rights
which
are
for
the
adjustment
board
to
determine
when
a
specific
case
is
processed
under
the
grievance
procedure.
there
are
two
lines
of
authority
that
seem
to
us
to
support
that
view,
one
is
the
delaware,
lackawanna
against
slocum
and
that
line
of
cases
holding
that
the
courts
may
not
act
in
a
matter
over
which
they
railway
adjustment
boards
have
jurisdiction.
and
the
second
is
exemplified
by
a
case
twa
against
koppal
and
345
u.s.
653,
holding
that
it
was
missouri
law
and
i
think
this
court
would
adopt
the
same
view,
that
where
an
arbitration
clause
was
available
in
a
contract
then
the
employee
must
resort
to
that
machinery
before
he
may
bring
suit
in
the
courts.
the
brotherhood
in
its
reply
brief
attempts
to
deal
with
these
points
to
the
number
of
ways
and
it's
easiest
to
take
each
of
the
up
seriatim.
they
say,
first,
that
the
decision
in
wiley
and
sons
does
not
preclude
broader
relief.
well
that's
true.
it's
the
slocum
case
and
twa
against
koppal
in
that
line
of
case
that
precludes
broader
relief
and
wiley
case
certainly
doesn't
entitle
them
to
broader
relief
because
all
it
held
was
that
the
dispute
might
go
to
arbitration.
then
they
say
that
the
merger
contract
provided
that
united
would
assume
all
the
debts
and
liabilities
of
capital,
and
that
delaware
law
required
united
to
assume
the
obligations
of
the
brotherhood-capital
agreement.
there
are
three
answers
i
think.
first,
i
doubt
whether
there
would
be
any
federal
jurisdiction
in
this
case
either
to
enforce
the
merger
contract
or
to
enforce
the
delaware
law.
second,
whatever
obligation
the
merger
contract
imposes
or
the
delaware
statute
imposes,
it
was
at
most
an
obligation
to
comply
with
the
clerks-capital
agreement
which
provides
for
its
enforcement
through
the
adjustment
board.
you
can't
get
away
from
the
adjustment
board
by
saying
that
there
is
an
obligation
to
comply
with
that
agreement.
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired.
i'll
leave
the
rest
in
my
brief.
