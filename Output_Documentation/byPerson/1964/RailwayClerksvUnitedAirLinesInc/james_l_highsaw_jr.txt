mr.

mr.
chief
justice,
my
name
is
a
very
unusual
one
and
i
think
just
looking
at
in
french
you
wouldn't
get
out
of
pronouncing.
my
family
has
always
pronounced
it
highsaw.
mr.

mr.

mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
the
basic
question
presented
to
the
court
by
this
case
is
one
of
jurisdiction.
the
issue
is
what
forum,
if
any,
has
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
the
brotherhood
of
railway
and
steamship
clerks
and
capital
airlines
terminated
from
the
merger
of
capital
into
united
airlines
on
june
1,
1961
are
whether
that
agreement
survive
the
merger
and
can
be
enforced
as
an
obligation
against
united
airlines.
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
which
is
under
review
in
this
case
and
the
positions
of
the
parties
as
presented
to
the
court,
four
different
answers
to
this
basic
question.
the
brotherhood
has
taken
the
position
that
jurisdiction
lies
in
the
federal
courts
on
a
suit
by
the
brotherhood
to
enforce
this
agreement
against
united
airlines.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
took
the
position
that
the
federal
courts
do
not
have
jurisdiction,
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
rested
in
the
national
mediation
board
because
it's
said
that
the
dispute
involved
a
matter
of
representation
and
a
representation
dispute
over
which
that
board
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
under
section
2,
ninth,
of
the
railway
labor
act.
united
agrees
for
that
position
but
united
goes
further.
united
says
that
the
dispute
isn't
justiciable
at
all
and
it
also
says
that
if
it
is
justiciable
at
all,
it
should
have
been
litigated
in
a
petition
before
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
to
review
the
order
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board
which
approved
the
merger.
finally,
the
united
states'
amicus
curiae
on
behalf
of
the
national
mediation
board,
says
that
the
national
mediation
board
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
this
dispute
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
holding
that
there
was
a
representation
dispute
involved
there
over
which
the
mediation
board
had
jurisdiction,
that
the
federal
courts
do
have
jurisdiction
entertained
the
brotherhood's
complaint
but
only
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
provide
for
a
board
of
adjustment
and
a
grievance
procedure
to
hear
grievances
of
employees
arising
out
of
the
agreement
and
that
the
ultimate
jurisdiction
to
determine
how
much
of
the
agreement
survives,
rests
in
this
adjustment
board.
at
this
time,
i
will
to
address
myself
to
the
position
of
the
brotherhood
and
of
the
united
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
will
address
myself
on
rebuttal
to
the
position
of
the
united
states
after
the
solicitor
general
has
given
his
argument.
i
think
that
in
order
to
carefully
understand
the
issues,
it
would
be
in
order
to
very
briefly
in
review
some
of
the
relevant
facts.
in
1947,
the
brotherhood
became
a
duly
authorized
representative
on
the
property
of
united
--
on
the
property
of
capital
it
is,
on
certain
of
the
employees
of
capital,
the
office,
the
clerical,
the
stores
and
the
passenger
service
employees.
thereafter,
it
negotiated
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
capital
that
under
the
railway
labor
act,
covering
the
rates
of
pay,
the
rules
and
working
conditions
of
these
employees.
in
1959,
it
entered
into
negotiation
with
capital
to
revise
that
agreement.
there
was
already
in
the
win
--
the
prospects
of
a
merger
by
capital.
there
had
already
been
one
aborted
merger
agreement
entered
into
which
had
not
been
finally
processed
before
the
board.
so,
the
brotherhood
bargained
for
and
it
obtained
in
this
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
1959
a
provision
to
the
effect
that
all
provisions
of
the
agreement
should
be
binding
upon
successors
and
assign
of
the
capital.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
that's
right
your
honor.
it
has
not
been
there
before.
and
that
was
put
in
there
because
of
the
situation
which
based
capital
and
because
of
the
fact
that
capital
indicated
that
its
financial
condition
was
such
that
it
might
have
merged
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
no,
that
type
was
not
a
fair
merger.
they
--
that
is
what
capital
represented
to
the
brotherhood.
only
fact
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
no.
that's
right,
your
honor.
about
a
year
after,
this
agreement
was
ordered,
one
other
provision
of
the
--
this
agreement
relating
to
successors
and
assigns
as
article
1(b)
in
which
this
provision
appears.
in
addition
to
the
provision
that
it
was
binding
upon
successors
and
assign
is
also
an
additional
provision
providing
that
there
should
--
in
the
event
of
a
consolidation
of
a
merger,
there
should
be
a
negotiation
to
the
procedure
to
be
followed
and
the
protection
to
be
accorded
the
capital
employees
and
that
90
days
notice
was
required
to
the
brotherhood
for
this
purpose.
about
a
year
after
this
provision
was
put
in
the
agreement
when
the
revised
agreement
became
effective
in
august
of
1960,
capital
and
united
entered
into
a
merger
contract.
one
of
the
provisions
of
that
merger
contract
obligated
united
to
assume
all
the
liabilities
of
capital
without
any
exclusion
or
exception
for
any
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
without
any
exclusion
or
exception
for
this
particular
collective
bargaining
agreement.
in
addition,
both
of
these
corporations
were
delaware
corporations
and
under
delaware
law,
a
surviving
corporation
is
required
to
take
over
the
liabilities
of
the
non-surviving
corporation
and
this
law
does
not
contain
any
exclusion
for
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
brotherhood
heard
about
this
merger
through
the
newspapers.
this
is
in
the
record,
your
honor.
and
shortly
thereafter,
it
advised
both
capital
and
united
that
it
was
invoking
the
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
that
it
wanted
to
have
negotiations
with
them
either
singly
or
jointly
for
the
purpose
of
implementing
this
agreement
and
reaching
a
decision
on
the
procedure
to
be
followed
and
the
protection
to
be
afforded
and
employed.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
this
was
immediately
after
the
merger
agreement.
the
merger
agreement
was
signed
on
the
august
11th,
the
brotherhood
read
about
it
in
the
newspapers
in
august
12th
and
it
sent
these
letters
out
on
august
16th,
1960.
both
carriers
refused
to
have
any
meetings
with
the
brotherhood.
the
brotherhood
during
the
period
of
the
next
year
and
up
to
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed
in
this
case,
made
repeated
efforts
to
have
negotiations
and
discussions
with
either
capital
or
united
or
both
working
on
this
subject
and
was
not
for
a
slight
refusal.
without
going
into
all
the
details
and
brief
the
position
of
the
united
was
that
it
had
no
obligations
and
no
duty
to
assume
the
obligations
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
position
of
capital
was
that
by
signing
a
merger
contract
that
it
put
itself
in
position
where
it
couldn't
do
anything
effective.
the
merger
agreement
had
to
be
submitted
to
the
civil
aeronautics
board
for
approval.
the
board
under
the
federal
aviation
act
has
a
general
authority
to
impose
reasonable
terms
and
conditions
that
approved
the
merger.
the
brotherhood
intervened
in
this
proceeding,
two
purposes.
one,
it
sought
the
ordinary
employee
protective
conditions
that
the
board
imposes
when
it
approves
the
merger
which
are
in
modification
of
the
washington
job
agreement
in
the
railroad
industry
in
which
i'm
sure
this
court
is
thoroughly
familiar.
and
the
brotherhood
also
asked
the
board
to
impose
if
it
approved
this
merger
a
condition
requiring
united
to
take
over
this
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
argued
to
the
board
as
a
matter
of
law,
united
was
required
to
take
it
over.
the
united
argued
to
the
board
that
it
--
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
agreement
terminated
when
the
merger
was
consummated.
united
also
argued
to
the
board
that
the
agree
--
that
the
question
was
not
one
for
proper
disposition
under
the
federal
aviation
act.
the
board
approved
the
merger
which
the
brotherhood
did
not
opposed,
it
imposed
the
employee
protective
conditions,
the
modification
in
the
washington
agreement.
it
declined
and
imposed
a
condition
requiring
united
to
take
over
the
agreement.
its
decision
and
the
reasons
for
it
one's
certain,
the
brotherhood
sought
clarification,
time
was
running
out
under
the
statute
to
do
anything
about
this
in
a
way
to
a
petition
to
court
of
appeals.
so,
the
brotherhood
petitioned
the
court
of
appeals
with
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
to
review
the
board's
order
on
this
another
point.
at
that
juncture,
the
board
came
in
and
said
that
we
did
not
ask
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
united
has
required
as
a
matter
of
law
to
take
over
this
agreement.
we
have
left
that
to
--
in
substance,
it
said,
we've
left
that
litigation
between
the
parties.
this
being
the
case,
the
brotherhood
ultimately
withdrew
its
petition
from
the
court
of
appeals
because
it
could
not
obtain
a
decision
on
this
question
by
pursuing
that
petition.
the
next
step
the
brotherhood
took
was
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
no,
because
under
the
statute
your
honor,
once
the
board
had
come
in
and
said,
“well,
all
we
did
was
we
exercised
our
discretion
and
substance
not
to
impose
this
condition.”
since
the
statute
is
very
clear
and
it
does
merely
authorize
that
the
board
to
impose
within
the
terms
and
conditions,
all
the
brotherhood
have
been
arguing
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
the
exercise
of
discretion.
it
wouldn't
have
been
arguing
the
basic
question.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
no,
they
specifically
said
that
they
did
not
decide
that
question.
they
--
it
appears
in
the
record,
your
honor,
at
page
50
of
the
record
that
they
specifically
told
the
court
of
appeals
that
they
had
not
decided
this
question.
i'm
reading
very
brief
of
the
sentence,
it
said,
“neither
did
it
purport
to
pass
on
the
issue
of
whether
united
would
be
justified
as
a
matter
of
contract
or
labor
law
and
ignoring
the
agreement.”
and
no
one
is
--
has
argued
in
this
case
up
to
now
that
the
board
did
pass
on
this
issue.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
did
pass
on
the
issue
of
the
survivability
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
for
the
first
time,
your
honor
in
this
litigation
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
that's
right.
for
the
first
time
in
this
litigation
and
the
brief
to
this
court,
united
makes
that
argument.
it
didn't
--
in
moving
to
dismiss
this
complaint
in
the
district
court,
it
didn't
make
this
argument.
and
for
the
first
time,
it
raises
this
question
and
it's
clear
from
what
the
board
said
that
it
did
not
pass
on
this
issue
and
then
consequently
there
was
no
way
that
this
issue
could
be
litigated
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
because
their
--
because
they
--
all
it
had
was
just
a
general
authorization
to
impose
a
general
reasonable
terms
and
conditions.
and
under
this,
i
think
that
the
board
had
almost
absolute
discretion
as
to
whether
it
would
impose
any
conditions
or
whether
it
wouldn't.
for
example,
it
did
not
impose
these
washington
agreement
conditions
for
a
long
time.
it
was
not
until
around
about
the
late
1940s
or
1950,
they
were
persuaded
to
finally
change
their
policy
on
that
and
these
conditions
they
imposed
have
been
simply
a
matter
of
discretion
and
policy
with
them.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
that's
right.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
well,
that's
right
your
honor
and
we
tried
--
we
tried
to
get
the
board
to
exercise
its
discretion.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
no,
no.
even
if
we
were
right,
even
if
we
were
absolutely
right,
the
board
could
say,
“well,
we
will
let
you
go
out
and
settle
that
some
place
else.
we're
not
going
to
settle
this
problem
by
doing
it
in
the
form
of
a
condition
in
our
order
approving
the
merger,”
and
that
was
the
--
that
was
what
they
said
they
did
and
i
think
that
they
had
the
--
clearly
had
the
legal
right
to
do
that.
the
--
otherwise,
that
you
would
have
to
say
that
they
had
an
absolute
obligation
under
the
statute
to
settle
this
and
i
don't
know
any
provision
of
the
statute
on
which
you
could
base
that
absolute
obligation.
following
this,
the
brotherhood
didn't
seek
to
file
grievances
with
united.
these
were
--
the
united
just
refused
to
accept
them
physically
that
is,
in
just
a
matter
of
processing
that
--
physically
return
them.
brotherhood
then
went
before
the
national
mediation
board
because
the
agreement
had
been
made
in
mediation
before
that
board
under
section
5(2)
of
the
railway
labor
act.
that
board,
in
that
case,
united
came
in
and
said
that
the
mediation
board
had
no
authority
to
pass
on
the
question
over
the
survivability
of
the
contract.
the
mediation
board
agreed
with
them.
they
did
issue
an
opinion
saying
they
agreed
that
with
the
brotherhood's
interpretation
of
the
language,
that
the
language
is
clear
and
unambiguous
and
meant
just
what
it
said
but
it
said,
“we
can't
had
all
that
jurisdiction
to
find
them
the
right
that
united
has
to
assume
the
obligations
to
this
contract.”
so,
in
that
situation,
the
brotherhood
filed
a
suit
in
the
federal
district
court
at
cincinnati,
southern
district
of
ohio,
to
enforce
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
the
bases
of
federal
jurisdiction
were
in
three
things,
your
honor.
the
title
28
section
1331
and
that
was
a
case
arising
under
the
railway
labor
act,
we
allege
that
the
united's
actions
violated
the
provisions
of
section
2,
second
--
first
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
requires
carriers
to
maintain
agreement.
it
violated
section
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
no.
i
don't
think
so.
no
i
don't
--
i
don't
believe
--
i
don't
believe,
that's
right,
because
the
jurisdiction
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board
and
the
power
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board
and
what
the
civil
aeronautics
board
has
to
do
is
laid
down
in
the
federal
aviation
act.
and
the
--
it
may
be,
--
your
honor
may
--
if
your
honor
may
have
in
mind
that
there
is
a
provision
in
the
federal
aviation
act
with
respect
to
the
--
if
a
carrier
certificate
can
be
revoked
if
it
fails
to
comply
with
the
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act,
what
the
jurisdiction
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board
under
this
is
not
absolute
either,
this
is
a
discretionary
jurisdiction.
it
has
--
it
has
been
utilized
on
one
or
two
occasions.
but,
its
jurisdiction
flows
out
of
the
federal
aviation
act
and
also
i
may
say
at
this
point,
your
honor
that
united
had
previously
claimed
to
the
board
that
this
wasn't
a
question
for
resolution
under
the
federal
aviation
act.
in
fact,
united's
basic
position
all
the
way
through
is
this
isn't
the
right
question
for
resolution
by
anybody.
and
coming
back
to
the
basis
of
our
jurisdiction,
we
say
that
it
was
a
violation
of
section
240
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
prohibits
a
carrier
from
changing
the
terms
and
conditions
and
the
rates
of
pay
and
the
working
conditions
of
employees
embodied
an
agreement
except
in
accordance
of
provisions
of
railway
labor
act.
section
6,
which
sets
up
certain
specific
procedures
by
which
the
carriers
have
to
change
those
provisions.
we
also
relied
on
section
1337
of
title
28
which
gives
federal
courts
jurisdiction
over
matters
arising
under
statutes
affecting
commerce.
as
an
alternative
jurisdiction,
we
asserted
jurisdiction
under
title
28,
1332
under
diversity
of
citizenship
because
the
brotherhood
which
located
in
cincinnati,
ohio
and
united
was
a
delaware
corporation.
we
asked
for
a
declaratory
injunction
declaring
the
rights
of
the
parties.
we
also
asked
that
united
be
enjoined
from
violating
the
agreement.
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
federal
courts
did
not
have
any
jurisdiction
not
on
--
because
none
of
these
provisions
that
i
have
been
reciting
were
applicable
or
not
because
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
had
jurisdiction.
united
was
not
even
asserting
that
point
then,
but
because
they
said
this
involved
the
representation
dispute
over
which
the
national
mediation
board
had
exclusive
jurisdiction.
now,
the
decisions
of
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
say
who
the
parties
to
this
representation
dispute
are
or
what
it's
about.
but
united's
brief
says
that
what
it
has
is
that
there
were
2700
employees
on
capital
covered
by
this
collective
bargaining
agreement.
after
the
merger,
2170
of
them
became
united
employees
and
were
unrepresented.
530
of
them
belong
to
a
group
known
as
a
ramp
and
stores
employees,
and
these
are
employees
are
represented
on
united
airlines
by
the
international
association
of
machinists.
so,
on
june
23rd,
1961,
united
entered
into
a
separate
agreement
the
machinist
by
which
these
employees
were
integrated
into
the
machinist
group
and
under
machinist
contact.
and
united
says
that
enforcement
of
this
brotherhood
contract
necessarily
raises
a
dispute
as
to
where
the
representatives
of
these
530
employees.
well,
this
is
not
so
unless
the
brotherhood
has
specifically
asked
that
this
contract
be
declared
invalid
and
it
hasn't
asked
anybody
to
declare
this
contract
invalid.
the
brotherhood
recognizes
that
where
you
have
a
collective
bargaining
representative
on
a
property
of
another
carrier
that
its
agreement
covering
some
of
these
people
can
be
terminated
in
accordance
with
the
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act
by
the
carrier
and
by
that
other
collective
bargaining
representative.
but
this
doesn't
affect
the
other
2170
employees
who
are
unrepresented
and
who
had
rights
under
this
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
moreover,
even
as
to
the
530,
their
rights
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
didn't
come
to
an
end
until
it
was
terminated
in
accordance
with
the
procedures
of
the
railway
labor
act
by
action
between
the
iam
and
united.
in
other
words,
the
--
it's
quite
clear
that
the
duty
of
united
was
to
take
over
and
apply
this
contract
even
to
these
530
until
such
time
as
they
entered
into
this
new
agreement.
united
also
makes
reference
to
the
fact
that
in
1962,
the
brotherhood
applied
to
represent
the
entire
craft
or
class
on
united.
in
other
words,
the
whole
craft
or
class
involves
about
12,000
people
and
the
2700
were
covered
by
this
contract
for
a
minority.
so
united
says
that
this
is
evidence
of
a
dispute
with
the
--
between
the
brotherhood
and
the
iam.
well,
the
--
i
think
the
united
states
very
correctly
entirely
points
out
that
this
looks
to
the
future,
its
respect
to
future
representations
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
rights
under
the
existing
contract.
united
also
suggests
that
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
wrong
on
the
representation
issue,
it
was
right
on
the
jurisdictional
matter
because
the
brotherhood
is
a
minority
representative
on
the
property
of
united
and
we
would
have
thought
that
this
question
was
disposed
off
by
your
decision
in
john
wiley
and
sons
in
which
these
question
was
raised.
united,
as
i
understand,
it
says
wiley
and
sons
on
this
point
isn't
applicable
because
there
was
a
suit
brought
under
section
301
of
the
labor
management
act
which
permit
suits
by
minority
representatives
whereas,
under
the
railway
labor
act,
it
contemplates
representational
made
by
majority
representatives
in
wiley
carrier
can
voluntarily
treat
but
in
minority
representative,
it
can't
be
required
to
do
so.
well,
what
united
is
comparing
here
is
a
suit
to
enforce
an
existing
agreement
with
the
question
of
what
rights
are
if
you
try
to
go
and
bargain
for
a
brand
new
agreement.
this
court
pointed
out
in
john
wiley
and
sons
case
that
the
union
on
the
non-surviving
company
was
not
seeking
any
right
except
rights
based
on
an
existing
agreement
and
that's
the
situation
here.
the
brotherhood
is
not
seeking
any
rights
other
than
those
based
on
existing
agreement.
we
believe
that
the
decision
in
international
association
of
machinists
v.
central
airlines
in
which
this
court
held
that
a
railway
labor
act
agreement
was
enforceable
under
federal
law
as
applicable.
united
says
that
well
the
iam
in
that
case
was
a
majority
representative
and
we
see
no
basis
to
restrict
the
iam
--
to
restrict
that
case
to
simply
a
majority
representative.
now,
united
also
takes
a
different
attack
than
the
jurisdiction
and
it
argues
strongly
in
its
brief
that
in
any
event,
the
complaint
should
have
been
dismissed
because
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
says
the
contract
did
terminate
when
the
merger
took
place.
now,
it
recognized
that
the
wiley
case
but
it
claims
this
is
different.
it
says
the
basic
difference
is
that
this
contract
was
entered
into
between
carriers
that
are
subject
to
the
civil
aeronautics
act,
that
the
board
approved
this,
that
the
board
imposed
employee
protective
conditions
and
these
employee
protective
conditions
met
the
needs
of
national
labor
policy
which
were
the
underlying
basis
of
the
wiley
decision.
in
the
first
place,
the
board
itself
didn't
say
this.
in
the
second
place
this
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
that's
right.
it
imposed
the
modified
washington
job
protection
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
--
your
honor,
that's
right.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
but
these
conditions
your
honor,
are
designed
primarily
to
take
care
of
a
man
who
loses
his
job
and
to
give
him
compensation
for
a
limited
period
of
time.
they're
limited
in
time.
they're
not
intended
to
equate
contract
rates.
the
board
itself
never
indicated
that
was
the
effect
of
them
and
if
your
honors
will
recall,
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
where
the
commission
is
required
to
impose
employee
protective
conditions
there's
a
specific
provision
in
the
statute
saying
that
that
does
not
supersede
private
contracts
involving
this.
so,
i
think
it's
pretty
difficult
to
say
that
the
board's
conditions
have
greater
impact
or
greater
power
than
those
imposed
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
it's
also
directly
contrary
to
all
the
practice
in
the
railroad
and
airline
industry
by
which
although
employee
conditions
have
been
imposed
over
a
period
of
great
many
years,
the
parties
still
take
over
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
they
work
these
matters
up
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
yes.
because
under
the
agreement,
it
was
to
expire
on
february
1,
1962
unless
30
days
notice
were
given
accordance
of
the
railway
labor
act
but
this
notice
wasn't
given,
it
continued
on
from
year-to-year.
and
of
course,
united
has
never
given
this
notice
because
this
would
be
inconsistent
with
its
position
of
the
contract
terminated
on
a
merger,
so
the
contract
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
that's
right.
unless
it
didn't
terminate
on
the
date
of
the
merger,
it
is
--
as
a
result
of
the
merger
it
is
in
effect
today.
united
also
suggests
that
the
merger
here
is
different
in
kind
and
quality
and
magnitude
from
the
john
wiley
merger.
well,
i
don't
think
you
can
decide
these
questions
on
the
size
of
the
carriers
or
the
size
of
the
companies
and
that
sort
of
a
principle
what
united's
argument
really
comes
down
to
is
they
say,
“well,
it
would
be
more
difficult
to
work
this
out
in
this
kind
of
a
situation.”
well,
this
agreement
contemplated
that
very
problem.
this
court
in
the
wiley
case
recognized
that
problem
but
said
that
this
wasn't
an
insurmountable
obstacle
to
enforcing
the
agreement.
and
in
this
particular
situation,
article
1(b)
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
contemplated
that
there
might
be
problems
and
contemplated
that
the
parties
should
get
together
and
work
them
out.
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
provision
that
they
have
get
together
and
decide
on
the
procedure
and
the
protection
to
the
current
employees
and
this
was
consistent
with
30
years
of
practice
under
the
railroad
industry
and
the
airline
industry.
so
i
don't
believe
that
united
can
argue
on
this
basis
that
the
contract
didn't
survive
the
merger.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i'd
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
this
matter
the
civil
aeronautics
board.
as
i
understood,
counsel
he
stated
that
it
was
the
united
to
position
before
the
board
that
the
board
had
the
power
to
do
this
and
he
empathetically
says
that
they
had
the
power
to
take
care
of
the
situation
now.
well
i
would
like
to
read
to
you
--
i
have
a
brief
of
united
dated
january
23,
1961,
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board
in
this
case
on
page
36.
i'm
writing
from
and
i'll
hand
it
to
count.
sir.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
this
is
the
brief
of
the
united
airlines
to
the
civil
aeronautics
board
in
the
united-capital
merger
case,
docket
number
11699,
dated
january
23,
1961
signed
by
counsel
for
the
law
firm
from
which
counsel
is
a
member.
and
i'll
hand
in
this
brief
after
i
get
through
so
he
can
check
it
as
to
the
accuracy
of
my
reading.
and
i'm
reading
from
page
36.
it
says,
“the
iam-brc
exception
to
examiner's
refusal
to
impose
a
wholly
new
condition
requiring
that
capital's
collective
bargaining
agreements
to
be
recognize
as
effective
after
the
merger
must
also
be
rejected.
first
of
all,
the
legal
question
as
to
the
effectiveness
of
capital's
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
not
one
for
resolution
by
the
board
under
the
federal
aviation
act.”
he
say's
other
things
but
that's
all
he
says
on
that
particular
point.
now,
i
refer
to
that
just
for
the
--
i
don't
agree
with
that
by
the
way.
i
think
the
board
had
power
to
impose
conditions
here
but
it
was
not
a
mandatory
power,
it
was
a
power
within
their
discretion.
they
decided
not
to
utilize
it.
and
this
left
the
matter
for
the
brotherhood
and
united
to
litigate
about.
i
think
the
complete
switching
position
of
united
before
the
board
and
there
before
this
court
is
simply
indicative
of
what
practically
all
our
arguments
here.
it's
the
kind
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
i
think
they
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
yes,
that's
right.
but
i
don't
think
they
had
to.
that's
the
point
that
i
make.
and
i
--
when
they
refuse
to
exercise
their
discretion
and
we
were
left
with
it
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
i
think
it
was
permissible
if
they
did
not
dispose,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
panagra
case
and
the
kent
--
in
the
kent
case
which
he
--
which
he
also
say
that
it
involved
anything
there
to
the
same
problem.
in
the
kent
case,
i
argued.
i
get
before
the
second
circuit
and
i
handled
it
all
the
way
through
the
court.
and
this
was
a
case
which
arose
long
after
two
or
three
years
after
the
pan
american-american
overseas
merger
and
it
arose
because
there
was
then
a
conflict
on
the
property
of
pan
american
which
prevented
the
merger
from
being
effectuated
and
the
board
moved
in
under
those
circumstances
and
said
that
we
are
acting
here
because
we
have
to
effect
--
we
have
to
make
--
carry
out
and
see
that
our
order
to
effectuate
the
merger
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
no.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
no.
i
don't
think
that's
the
reason
they
did
it.
i
don't
--
i
do
--
and
of
course
they
didn't
say,
so
i
don't
know
but
i
don't
believe
that
--
i
don't
believe
that
is
said.
and
the
panagra
case
involved
problems
as
i
recollect
of
statutory
interpretation
which
we
don't,
we
don't
have
involved
in
this
case.
the
board's
original
decision
was
a
desire
of
recollecting,
it
had
no
statutory
power
in
that
situation
to
act
and
i
think
that's
the
difference
in
the
situation.
now,
referring
to
united's
position
i
--
as
i
say,
i
think
there
are
switchers
indicative
of
a
number
of
their
arguments,
it's
kind
of
'any
old
port
in
the
storm'
kind
of
a
situation.
maybe
they've
just
been
trying
to
prevent
this
issue
of
the
survivality
of
this
contract
from
being
litigated
anywhere.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
i
don't
--
well
the
only
issue
i
think
that
ought
to
be
submitted
to
an
arbitrator,
your
honor,
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
particular
employee
has
agreements
because
united
violated
the
contract.
i
don't
think
they
should
submit
to
the
arbitrator
the
question
of
whether
the
contract
survive
the
merger
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
--
i
think
the
court
should
decide
that.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
well,
if
the
court
says
that
we
won't
decide
that
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
well
if
they
--
if
that's
what
the
court
decides,
then
i
think
that
the
court
also
ought
to
make
clear
to
united,
that
united
should
sit
down
with
the
brotherhood
in
good
faith
under
this
last
clause
of
article
1(b)
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
negotiate
in
good
faith
about
the
procedure
to
be
followed
and
they
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
well,
if
that
is
all
that
the
court
says
and
then
i
think
that
the
rights
of
the
employees
in
this
situation
will
be
defeated.
because
all
it
will
then
come
before
arbitrator
are
those
grievances
which
may
involve
particular
narrow
portions
of
the
agreement
of
which
they
(voice
overlap).
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
well,
we
be
--
because
of
the
fact
your
--
because
of
the
uncertainty
of
this
agreement
and
the
whole
situation
that
has
prevailed
for
three
years,
it's
not
been
a
normal
situation.
you've
not
been
having
employees
coming
and
filing
grievances.
they're
under
an
absolute
unilateral
company
regulations
in
which
the
company
is
in
the
position
to
fire
them.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
you
don't
have
that
kind
of
a
situation
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
well
as
to
the
future,
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
there's
been
three-and-a-half
years
have
gone
by
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
with
respect,
well
we
think
that
the
--
we
think
that
the
court
can
declare
that
the
contract
survived
and
that
then
the
individuals
who
have
already
filed
grievances
--
and
there
are
some
grievances
on
the
file,
it
can
then
go
in
and
submit
these
grievances
only
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
carrier
took
the
action
which
violated
the
contract.
they
don't
have
to
litigate
all
over
again
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
contract
itself
should
survive
after
having
litigated
this
in
the
courts
and
the
mediation
board
and
then
they're
similarly
not
explored
for
all
of
these
years.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
well
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
well,
counts
are
number
of
things.
the
solicitor
general
relied
on
the
koppal
case.
if
you
will
recall
the
koppal
case,
is
a
case
which
says
that
you
have
to
use
these
procedures
only
if
the
applicable
state
law
requires
you
to
do
it.
this
is
not
a
matter
of
federal
laws.
this
is
the
applicable
state
law.
and
the
applicable
state
law
in
this
case
is
the
delaware
law.
and
we
say
that
the
question
of
the
--
whether
delaware
law
required
them
to
do
this
is
something
of
the
arbitrator
can't
decide.
we
also
say
that
an
arbitrator
can't
decide
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
merger
contract
itself
required
united
to
assume
all
the
obligations
of
this.
furthermore,
we
don't
think
that
after
the
national
mediation
board
has
interpreted
in
the
language
of
this
1(b)
that
this
people
ought
to
even
have
to
--
to
arbitrate
over
with
an
arbitrator
the
question
of
whether
the
--
whether
any
particular
provisions
of
the
contract
applied
and
finally
and
the
most
important
reason
of
all
is
that
this
is
completely
inconsistent
where
the
whole
practice
and
procedure
under
the
railway
labor
--
in
the
railway
labor
industry
and
the
airline
industry
for
30
somewhat
years.
the
contracts
have
always
been
assumed.
the
parties
have
always
sat
down
and
work
out
these
problems
in
negotiations
after
the
contracts
have
been
assumed.
and
to
require
the
arbitration
of
whether
or
not
the
contract
survives
at
this
point
would
be
completely
consistent
with
this.
now,
counsel
has
tried
to
take
this
merger
out
from
one
role
of
this
practice
for
saying,
well,
it
was
a
shotgun
situation.
we
had
to
take
quick
sanction
something
was
necessary.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
brotherhood
tried
to
get
them
to
sit
down
on
august
16,
1960.
the
record
shows
that
and
this
merger
didn't
take
place
since
of
june
1,
1961.
they
had
a
period
of
about
nine
or
ten
months
in
there
in
which
any
problems
of
any
kind
that
could
have
rose
out
of
their
assumption
of
liability
into
this
contract
could
have
been
worked
out.
it
was
no
--
it
was
no
shotgun
situation.
they
just
did
not
want
to
take
over
this
contract
and
they
keep
talking
about
the
fact
that
the
employees
are
better
off
under
this
--
better
off
under
this
situation
they
got
now
under
the
unilaterally
imposed
regulations
of
the
company.
well,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
record
shows
that
this
was
specifically
disputed
before
the
district
court.
in
an
affidavit
signed
by
mr.
dennis
who
who
took
two
pages
citing
forth
the
injury
to
the
employees.
and
secondly,
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
said
that
this
argument
was
irrelevant
to
jurisdiction
which
should
very
clearly
has
had
got
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
in
this
situation.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
what
i
have
to
say
about
that
your
honor
is
that
the
record
shows
mr.
dennis'
affidavit
that
there
has
been
injury
to
the
employees.
and
we
have
rights
of
the
employees
to
be
protected
in
this
situation.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
rights
under
almost
every
provision
of
the
contract
which
have
been
violated
by
this
carrier.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
well,
the
--
one
is
an
automatic
pay
to
the
type
of
arrangement,
which
the
carrier
has
not
provided.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
automatic
pay
provision.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
and
bidding
rights
of
these
people,
seniority
rights
to
be
handled.
they're
all
listed
in
the
record
in
this
case
and
the
affidavit
of
mr.
dennis
at
about
page
10
--
112.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
yes.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
we've
asked
them
to
sit
down
and
bargain
about
all
of
these
matters
from
august
11,
1960
until
we
filed
this
complaint.
and
all
they
would
do
is
say
that,
“we
have
no
obligations
of
any
kind,
shape
or
description
and
we
won't
talk
to
you
about
it.”
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
well
the
question
of
whether
or
not
they
violated
the
contract
is
but
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
contract
survived,
i
don't
think
it
is
for
the
reason
which
i've
been
trying
to
give,
your
honor.
another
reason
is
that
the
--
this
whole
procedure
setup
under
this
article
43
is
not
a
procedure
that
was
ever
intended
to
and
is
not
conducive
to
the
deciding
basic
questions,
like
whether
or
not
a
contract
survived
the
merger.
it's
setup
to
decide
basically
whether
or
not
a
carrier
violated
a
particular
provision
of
a
contract
when
it
did
something
to
an
employee.
and
that
it's
never
utilized
for
this
purpose
and
it's
not
setup
for
that
purpose,
so
that
if
it
has
attempted
to
use
it
for
that
purpose,
the
rights
of
the
employees
are
going
to
necessarily
be
injured
in
this
situation.
and
we
would
like
to
sit
down
i
say
on
the
bargaining
and
talk
to
them
about
all
these
things.
but
we
can't
get
them
to
talk.
they
say
they
don't
have
to
talk
to
us.
and
we
would
sit
down
with
them
tomorrow.
we
may
not
have
any
problem
with
them.
if
they
sat
down
with
us
tomorrow
and
bargain
here,
there
might
not
be
anything
to
arbitrate.
and
we
never
have
to
arbitrate.
we'd
just
be
going
through
the
motions,
we
don't
know.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
on
behalf
of
the
employees
that
are
covered
by
this
contract
and
the
2700,
2170
employees
are
still
unrepresented
on
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
and
if
there
were
any
problems,
your
honor,
we
would
on
behalf
of
the
--
if
any,
if
there
weren't
any
problems
between
june
1
and
june
23,
1961
and
i
don't
know
of
any
at
the
moment,
on
those
employees.
but
after
june
3,
1961,
those
employees
were
represented
by
the
iam
and
i'm
--
and
i
do
not
think
that
we
can
sit
down
and
bargain
for
those
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
not
now,
no.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
they
were
taken
out
from
under
this
agreement
by
the
agreement
between
the
--
between
the
iam
and
united
on
june
23,
1961.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
because
you
can
always
terminate
the
obligations
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act.
and
that
--
and
united
has
asserted
that
it
acted
in
accordance
with
these
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act
and
i
have
no
knowledge
to
the
--
they're
differently.
and
if
they
did,
then
they
have
taken
these
530
people
out
from
under
the
contract.
