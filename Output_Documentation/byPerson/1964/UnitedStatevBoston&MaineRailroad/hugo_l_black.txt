justice
hugo
l.
black
was
international
organizing
this
whole
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
doesn't
the
section
then
precisely
cover
the
funds
without
any
stretching
of
language?
justice
hugo
l.
black
anything
about
fraud?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
anything
in
the
statute
that
would
cover
it
under
fraud?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
all
they
can
see.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you've
used
it,
that's
not
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
was
asking
because
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
does
require
the
following
--
excluding
a
criminal
statute
that
deals
with
our
custom
to
be
very
careful
without
stretching
it
beyond
what
the
man
would
expect
it
to
leave.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
that
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
civil
case,
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
proctor,
are
you
representing
both
the
railroad
and
the
individuals?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
was
wondering
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
that
the
government
is
arguing
that
the
railroad
has
substantial
interest
in
this
contract?
i
can
understand
that
the
officials
who
are
going
to
get
something
out
of
it
might
have
known.
are
they
arguing
that
the
railroad
have
a
substantial
interest?
