mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government,
in
securing
this
indictment
and
in
its
bill
of
particulars
has
used
a
number
of
words
attempting
to
define
what
constitutes
a
substantial
interest
in
this
public
corporation.
they
have
used
these
terms
“the
substantial
interest”
of
the
defendants,
mcginnis
and
glacy
in
international
consisted,
first,
an
understanding,
an
agreement,
relationship,
arrangement,
and
concert
of
action
among
the
said
defendants
and
international.
for
among
the
purpose
of
producing
profits
for
international
and,
pursuant
to
which,
the
defendants,
mcginnis,
glacy,
and
benson,
were
to
and
did
receive
substantial
moneys.
now,
i
think
it
must
be
clear
that
none
of
those
nouns
represents
what
we
commonly
understand
as
an
interest
in
a
corporation.
understanding,
agreement,
relationship,
arrangement,
all
of
those
speaks
in
terms
of
dealing
with
an
outsider
either
by
way
of
contract
or
informal
agreement
or
understanding.
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
it
would
not,
although
--
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
--
although
i
don't
have
to
go
so
far
as
--
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
--
to
substantiate
my
argument.
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
a
stock
interest
or
a
beneficial
stock
interest.
i'm
not
claiming
it
need
be
a
legal
ownership
of
the
stock,
but
it
must
be
something
which
is
equivalent
or
like
being
a
director
or
officer
in
the
corporation
because
the
statute
refers
to
them
and,
interchangeably,
it
must
be
either
an
officer
or
agent
in
the
corporation
or
having
a
substantial
interest.
it
may
speak
--
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
involves
an
element
of
control
or
partial
control.
a
control
which
is
--
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
that
might
be
that
it
might
--
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
i
think
that
is
true.
i
think
that
the
element
of
control
or
partial
control,
as
the
history
of
the
statute
shows
which
i
hope
to
develop
in
the
time
i
have,
shows
that
that
is
what
is
meant.
i
was
about
to
say
that
these
relationships
that
i
describe
speak
in
terms,
really,
of
contract
or
agreements
or
arrangement
with
somebody
in
the
outside.
perhaps
the
term
“arrangement”
and
“concert
of
actions”
speaks
in
terms
of
conspiracy.
again,
in
which
these
men,
glacy,
benson,
and
mcginnis,
they're
not
within
this
corporation.
they
have
no
position
of
control
within
it,
no
ownership
of
any
kind
within
it,
but
they
are
using
it
for
which,
if
this
indictment
is
sustained,
as
the
government
claims,
they
receive
bribes.
and,
i
should
like
also
to
emphasize
that
much
of
my
brother's
argument
is
based
upon
facts
which
are
alleged
in
count
ii
which
are
no
part
of
count
i,
which
are
--
which
are
not
incorporated
into
count
i
in
any
way
and
if
there's
anything
clear
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
is
that
an
indictment--
the
count
in
an
indictment
stands
on
its
own
bottom
and
not
with
relation
to
other
counts
in
the
declara
--
in
the
indictment.
i
think
it's
quite
important
in
this
instance
to
have
that
in
mind
because
the
government's
procured
another
indictment
within
the
last
month
against
these
same
men
and
alleging
the
same
things
that
are
alleged
in
these
particulars,
but
the
count
ii
--
there's
no
count
ii
there
like
this
count
ii.
so,
i
say
that
the
court
should
not
construe
count
i
as
incorporating
in
anyway
of
allegations
of
count
ii,
unless
they
want
every
--
every
time
this
allegation
is
made
for
us
to
have
to
come
up
here
and
decide
whether
or
not
it
connects
with
another
count.
it
means
something
different.
now
--
so,
i
say
that
this
falls
short
of
alleging
anything
which,
in
common
definition,
common
understanding,
amounts
to
an
interest
in
a
corporation.
the
first
branch
of
my
argument
is,
of
course,
that
this
is
a
criminal
statute
and,
as
such,
should
be
strictly
construed,
as
mr.
justice
black
indicated
in
his
question
to
my
brother.
and,
it
is
also
important
that
the
language
be
of
sufficient
clarity
to
inform
individuals
of
the
kind
of
things
that
they're
not
forbidden
to
do.
that
was
decided
only
last
monday
in
an
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
cox
against
louisiana.
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
your
honor,
when
a
case
is
put
on
the
list
of
where
we
have
only
a
half-hour
to
argue,
i
understand
that
only
one
counsel
may
argue,
unless
their
interests
are,
in
effect,
different
so
as
to
permit
two
would
argue.
in
this
case,
(inaudible)
and
gray
who
represent
the
railroad
have
us
made
to
argue
in
their
behalf
as
well
as
in
behalf
of
the
individual
defendants.
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
so,
i
do
speak
in
my
--
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
no,
they
don't
argue
that.
the
statute,
your
honor,
provides
no
common
carrier
and
so
forth
engaged
in
comments
shall
have
any
dealings
in
securities,
supplies,
or
other
articles
of
colors
or
make
any
contracts
for
construction
and
maintenance
to
an
amount
of
more
than
$50,000
in
any
year
with
another
corporation,
firm,
partnership,
or
association
when
the
said
common
carrier
shall
have
up
on
its
board
of
directors
or
its
president,
manager,
or
its
purchasing
or
selling
officer,
or
agent
in
a
particular
transaction
any
person
who,
at
the
same
time,
a
director,
manager,
or
purchasing
agent
or
selling
officer,
or
who
has
any
substantial
interest
in
the
other
corporation.
and,
that
i
think
that
answers
mr.
justice
white's
question
of
my
brother
as
to
whether
the
statute
did
make
provisions
for
agency
relations
between
the
two.
it
does,
as
in
the
clause
that
i
have
just
read.
if
any
of
these
directors
are
selling
agents
of
the
boston
&
maine
are
also
directors
or
selling
agents
of
the
purchasing
operation,
then
the
statute
does
affect
them
and
the
boston
&
maine
is
liable,
as
well
as
the
defendants.
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
that's
right.
it
could
be
a
purchasing
or
selling
officer.
that's
right
to
that
extent
--
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
only
an
agent
who
is
a
purchasing
or
selling
officer
or
director.
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
yes,
a
difference
in
degree,
certainly.
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
well,
it's
not
alleged.
it's
not
alleged
(voice
overlap)
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
no.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
now,
i
have
in
my
sec
--
in
brief
and
--
and
the
boston
&
maine
railroad
has
in
its
brief
also
citations
of
cases
in
which
the
common
usage,
the
common
meaning
of
the
word
“interest”
in
a
company
or
corporation
is
dealt
with
and,
invariably,
it
refers
to
it
as
a
proprietary
interest.
there
are
three
will
cases
that
are
cited
where
a
person
leaves
my
interest
in
such
and
such
a
company
and
it
is
held
that
that
does
not
--
does
not
convey
debts
--
an
indebtedness
that
is
owed
to
a
stockholder
of
the
corporation
and,
the
same
--
the
same
decisions
have
been
made
in
statutes
involved
in
regard
to
taxing
statutes
and
in
regard
to
statutes
relating
to
the
reaching
and
applying
of
property
in
attachment
on
mean
process.
that
kind
of
an
interest
is
not
an
interest
in
a
corporation.
i
will
pass
over
those
cases
because
they
aren't
cited
at
length
in
the
brief
and,
in
connection
with
that,
i
want
to
point
out,
and
this
is
an
answer
to
one
of
the
questions
from
the
bench,
i
think
mr.
justice
black
asked
whether
there
were
any
other
similar
statutes.
now,
there
are
any
--
there
are
a
number
of
statutes
dealing
with
conflicts
of
interests,
but
they
never
speak
in
terms
of
an
interest
in
the
other
company
or
corporation.
they
speak
of
interests
in
a
transaction,
interest
in
a
contract,
interest
in
the
proceeds
of
a
transaction.
such
was
the
dixon-yates
case
and
such
are
the
rules
of
the
s.e.c.
and
--
in
the
domain
case.
those
all
--
all
those
conflict
of
interest
statutes,
never
speak
in
terms
of
interest
in
a
company,
but
interest
in
a
transaction
and,
in
those
cases,
you
get
the
result
that
you
would
expect
where
a
person
does
have
an
interest
in
a
transaction
or
the
proceeds
of
the
transaction.
he
is
guilty
of
violating
those
statutes.
now
--
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
i
think
that
would
mean
--
i
think
that
would
mean,
your
honor
either
a
known
or
a
silent
partner.
i
think
it
would
--
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
i
should
think--
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
i
should
think
that
if
it
--
if
it
went
to
the
point
of
representing
a
share
in
the
partnership
over
a
very
long
period
of
years
that
might
well
be
an
interest
in
the
company.
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
yes.
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
i
think
that
if
you
read
the
whole
indictment,
your
honor,
and
not
merely
the
--
the
bill
of
particulars,
you'll
find
that
they
relate
to
this
particular
transaction
only.
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
no,
sir.
we're
really
--
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
that's
what
i
--
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
well,
it's
on
page
9.
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
well,
i
think
i'm
referring
now
to
--
yes,
on
the
record
--
page
9
of
the
record.
the
event
says,
on
august
14,
1958,
the
b
&
m
violated
section
10
by
having
dealings
in
certain
articles
of
commerce
amounting
to
more
than
$50,000
with
another
corporation,
when
the
said
defendant,
b
&
m
had
up
on
its
board
of
directors
and
so
forth
with
he
who
had
a
substantial
interest.
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
that's
right.
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
well,
i
should
think
that
that
--
i
should
think
that
--
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
the
rest
of
the
count
which
i'm
reading
says
that
the
aforesaid
dealings
consisted
of
the
sale
with
international
of
eight
stainless
cars
and
passenger
coaches
and
two
stainless
and
combination
baggage
coaches.
and,
that's
the
single
transaction,
waiting
for
these
particular
transactions
and
it
said
that
it
takes
place
on
august
14,
1958.
i
submit
that
that
does
not
indicate
or
riveting
the
price
to
even
the
presumption
--
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
edward
o.
proctor,
sr.
i
--
my
time
is
getting
pretty
short,
if
i
hope
to
finish
this
afternoon,
and
i
had
hoped
to.
and,
i
--
i
--
it
is
very
important
that
this
is
an
anti-trust
statute.
this
was
passed
50
years
ago
in
response
to
a
message
from
president
wilson,
and
that
it
was
--
it
was
designed
to
supplement
the
sherman
act
and
other
--
other
antitrust
acts
and
was
to
nip
in
the
butt,
as
the
cases
have
said,
or
in
its
--
or
to
prevent
in
its
incipiency
conspiracies
and
so
forth
in
restraint
of
trade.
and,
there
were
certain
wrongs
of
certain
evils
which
were
pointed
out
by
president
wilson
in
his
message
and
--
and
in
the
reports
of
the
committee
both
of
the
house
and
senate
in
connection
with
this
major.
one
was
tying
clauses
in
contracts,
another
was
holding
companies,
and
another
was
interlocking
and
price
--
and
price
discrimination.
the
original
house
bill
dealt
with
the
interlocking
evil
by
forbidding
it
altogether.
the
house
bill
forbid
interlocking
altogether
and
made
it
a
crime.
the
senate
felt
that
that
was
too
drastic
in
connection
with
railroads
and
parties
--
and
companies
with
whom
they
dealt,
and
substituted
this
bidding,
this
requirement
for
competitive
bidding,
believing
that
that
was
adequate
to
cover
the
evil.
and,
when
they
did
that,
the
statute
merely
related
to
interlocks.
it
had
no
provision
about
substantial
interests,
but
the
senate
believed
that
there
was
an
opportunity
for
evasion
--
ready
evasion,
by
having
some
relative
or
your
lawyer
on
the
board
instead,
and
so
they
suggest
--
suggested
that,
to
prevent
that
evasion,
they
would
make
--
put
in
this
clause
about,
first
they
said,
direct
or
indirect
interest,
and
then
in
conference
it
was
changed
to
“any
substantial
interest.”
and,
i
submit
that,
in
that
history
of
the
--
of
the
statute,
it
is
directed
against
a
particular
form
of
conflict
of
interest.
it
is
not
a
conflict
of
interest
statement
--
statute
like
these
others
that
i
have
referred
to.
it
is
not
a
general
conflict
of
interest
statute.
it
is
a
conflict
of
intereststatute
which
consists
of
interlocking
or
of
measures
taken
to
evade
the
interlocking
provisions.
i
have
of
course
argued,
as
the
boston
&
maine
have
argued
even
more
eloquently
in
their
brief,
that
the
statute,
stated
in
such
general
terms
as
substantial
interest,
should
not
be
stretched
into
an
implausible
and
unusual
meaning,
particularly
where
the
effect
of
it
is
to
impose
upon
the
boston
&
maine
railroad,
an
innocent
party,
the
liability
--
criminal
liability
for
acts
and
conduct
for
which,
in
the
very
nature
of
things,
they
would
be
unaware.
admittedly,
the
statute
does
make
the
boston
&
maine
railroad
liable
when
the
acts
are
committed
where
there
is
an
interlocking,
perhaps
the
senate
or
perhaps
congress
assumed
that
there
would
be
means
by
which
a
railroad
would
know
about
interlocking,
perhaps
even
of
stock
interests
in
other
companies.
but,
the
argument
is
not
that
that
cannot
be
done
but
that
it
is
--
but
that
the
statute
ought
not
to
be
stretched,
so
to
speak,
to
give
an
unusual
meaning
to
the
term
“interest”
in
a
corporation
or
other
business
entity
when
the
effect
of
it
would
be
to
make
an
innocent
railroad
liable
for
conduct
against
its
own
interest
which
they
could
not
possibly
be
made
aware.
thank
you,
your
honor.
