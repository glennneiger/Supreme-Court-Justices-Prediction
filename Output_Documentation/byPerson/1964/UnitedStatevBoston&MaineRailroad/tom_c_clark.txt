what
about
the
antitrust
aspect
of
the
statute?
this
is
an
antitrust
statute.
justice
tom
c.
clark
not
just
a
conflict
of
interest
statute.
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
antitrust
laws.
justice
tom
c.
clark
which,
i
would
assume,
would
be
directed
towards
the
accumulation
of
power.
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
only
thought
right
here
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
and,
right
here,
that
the
carrier
can
be
fined
along
with
the
embezzling
officer.
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
there
--
an
interlocking
director
here
or
president?
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
do
you
depend
upon?
justice
tom
c.
clark
in
the
other
corporation?
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
interest
here
is
in
the
contract,
isn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
did
they
all
adopt
that?
justice
tom
c.
clark
no
--
there's
no
interest
in
it
then
physically,
except
this
contract?
justice
tom
c.
clark
he
had
to
take
that.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
think
that
arrangement
comes
within
those
words
of
the
company
and
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
the
interest
in.
justice
tom
c.
clark
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
