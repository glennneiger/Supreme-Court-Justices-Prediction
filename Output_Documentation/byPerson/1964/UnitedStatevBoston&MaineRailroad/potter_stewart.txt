why
isn't
that
just
a
bribe?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
understand
--
i
understand
your
point
that
if
the
bribe
were
in
the
form
of
shares
of
common
stock
of
the
bribing
corporation,
that
would
be
a
substantial
interest
because
that
meets
the
common
ordinary
sense
of
that
term
“substantial
interest,”
a
proprietary
interest,
an
ownership
interest.
but,
that
was
not
this
case.
this
was
money
and
why
wasn't
it
simply
a
bribe
as
my
brother
goldberg
has
suggested.
justice
potter
stewart
what
made
it
different?
justice
potter
stewart
in
a
situation
presented
by
this
case
or
at
least
the
allegations
of
indictment
of
this
case,
what's
the
--
what's
the
importance
of
this
question?
the
second
count
was
brought
under
18
u.s.c.
section
660
which
expressly
covered
this
situation,
an
officer
of
a
carrier
stealing
money
from
it,
and
that
covers
it.
it
covers
it
explicitly,
expressly.
what's
the
importance
of
the
--
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
there
was
no
defense.
justice
potter
stewart
the
real
wrong
here
was
the
failure
of
the
boston
&
maine
to
go
with
these
things
on
a
competitive
bidding
basis
the
way
the
statute
is
read.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
criminal,
the
way
the
statute
is
written,
is
the
boston
&
maine
railroad
which
could
be
fined
up
to
$25,000
or
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
selling
these
cars
on
competitive
bidding.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
kind
of
a
law
is
it
that
makes
the
--
a
person
who
was
robbed
a
criminal
because
of
that
robbery
and
there
--
and
has
to
pay
$25,000
more?
justice
potter
stewart
but,
under
the
statute,
must
--
much
less
punishable
by
--
much
lower.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i
can
see
it.
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
to
involve
some
control.
justice
potter
stewart
because
mr.
justice
goldberg's
hypothetical
case
gave
you
the
nicest
part
of
being
a
stockholder,
that
is,
50%
of
the
profits
is
equivalent
of
50%
of
the
stock.
justice
potter
stewart
the
only
thing
it's
lacking
is
control.
justice
potter
stewart
and,
there's
no
--
there's
no
indication
on
page
24
and
25
that
the
understanding
agreement,
relationship,
arrangement,
and
concert
of
action
was
the
same
thing
as
the
single
transaction
on
august
14.
if
that's
being
hypothetical
then
i
think
that
as
a
matter
of
literal
accuracy,
is
correct.
