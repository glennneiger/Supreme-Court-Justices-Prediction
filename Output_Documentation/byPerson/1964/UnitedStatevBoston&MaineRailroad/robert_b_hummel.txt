mr.
robert
b.
hummel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
the
dismissal
of
count
i
of
a
two-count
indictment
by
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
massachusetts,
chief
judge
sweeny.
the
appeal
is
directly
to
this
court
under
the
criminal
appeals
act
since
the
dismissal
was
based
solely
on
the
court's
construction
of
a
statute.
the
appellees
are
the
boston
&
maine
railroad
and
three
individuals,
who
held
the
positions
which
i
shall
describe
during
the
pertinent
period,
patrick
b.
mcginnis
who
was
president
and
director
of
that
railroad,
george
f.
glacy
and
daniel
a.
benson,
both
vice-presidents.
the
charge
was
laid
under
section
10
of
the
clayton
act
and,
in
essence,
it
was
that
the
appellees
--
the
appellee,
boston
&
maine
railroad,
with
the
aid
of
and
direct
participation
of
the
individual
appellees,
sold
10
railway
cars
to
a
company
known
as
international
railway
equipment
corporation
without
competitive
bidding
which,
in
our
view,
was
required
by
section
10
of
the
clayton
act.
we
postulate
the
requirement
for
competitive
bidding
on
the
ground
that
there
existed
the
interlocking
relationships
which
section
--
section
10
requires
when
a
railroad
is
dealing
in
its
own
property
or
in
supplies
and
equipment
with
another
company.
statute
provides
the
following
types
of
interlocking
relationships
give
rise
to
the
necessity
for
competitive
bidding.
on
the
part
of
the
carrier,
if
the
person
is
a
director,
president,
manager,
purchasing
or
selling
officer,
or
agent
in
a
particular
transaction
and,
on
the
part
of
the
other
company,
if
he
is
at
the
same
a
director,
manager,
purchasing
or
selling
officer,
or
has
any
substantial
interest
in
the
other
corporation,
firm,
partnership,
or
association,
then
the
requirement
for
competitive
bidding
arises.
and,
in
this
case,
the
narrow
question
is,
the
meaning
of
the
place,
any
substantial
interest
since
there's
no
allegation
that
the
individual
appellees
held
a
position
as
director
managing
or
purchasing
or
selling
officer
with
the
international
company.
our
position,
in
brief,
is
that
if
the
other
firm,
the
firm
with
whom
the
railroad
is
dealing,
is
being
operated
in
substantial
part
for
the
benefit
of
the
carrier
officials
who
hold
the
position
with
the
railroad
specified
in
the
statute,
in
that
event,
carrier
officers
have
a
substantial
interest
in
the
company
and
the
need
for
competitive
bidding
follows.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well,
the
bribe
case,
we
think,
presents
a
slightly
different
question.
it
might
depend
on
the
kind
of
a
bribe.
if
it
were
a
promise
of
stock
to
be
delivered
20
days
after
the
transaction
had
taken
place,
i
think
it
would
be
--
it
would
give,
perhaps,
the
bribee
very
clearly
an
equitable
stock
interest
in
the
company.
it
might
not
be
a
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
cash
payment
would
raise,
perhaps
to
attenuated
a
--
an
--
an
interest.
i'm
not
sure
it
would
be
substantial
--
a
substantial
interest
in
that
event,
although
i
think,
in
a
--
in
appropriate
circumstances,
it
might
be
sufficient.
if
you
could
show
a
course
of
dealings
which
would
indicate
that
the
person
taking
the
bribe
had
a
real
solid
expectation
of
additional
bribes,
i
think
it
might
meet
the
--
the
test.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well,
these
involved
payments
of
$71,500,
all
except
a
payment
of,
i
believe
it
was,
$1,500
being
subsequent
to
the
transaction.
and,
the
allegation
of
the
indictment
is
that
there
was
a
scheme
and
arrangement,
under
which
the
individual
appellees
would
direct
property
to
the
international
company
and,
in
return
for
that,
when
the
international
company
made,
for
the
purpose
of
producing
profits
for
international
and
that
they
would
then
subsequently
receive
substantial
moneys,
now
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well,
i
--
i
suppose
you
could
describe
any
type
of
grant
--
an
interest
in
the
company
as
a
bribe.
our
position
was
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well
let
me
suggest,
first
of
all
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
--
that
calling
it
a
bribe
may
not
mean
that
they
didn't
have
a
substantial
interest
in
the
company.
and,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
count
ii
of
the
indictment
from
which
it
appears
that
international's
business
for
the
year
in
which
this
transaction
took
place
amounted
to
some
$480,000,
almost
all
of
which
was
in
the
property
of
the
boston
&
maine
river.
it
also
appears
in
that
count
that
the
international
paid
for
the
railway
cars
which
were
involved
with
a
postdated
check,
i
think
in
fair
inference,
being
that
the
check
was
postdated
because
they
expected
to
make
it
good
out
of
the
resale
to
the
wabash
railroad
which
was
involved.
and,
in
those
circumstances,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
what
amounts
to
a
joint
enterprise.
you
can
call
it
bribe
if
you
wish,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
international
company
and
the
individual
appellees
were
so
closely
aligned
and
the
interest
of
the
individual
appellees
were
so
tied
to
the
success
of
the
enterprise
that
they
had
for
purposes
of
a
conflict
of
interest
situation
which
is
what
we
believe
the
statute
deals
with,
a
substantial
interest
of
the
corporation.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
i
think
that's
quite
true.
the
alternative
to
that
is
the
appellee's
position
which
is
apparently
that
the
statute
covers
only
a
stock
interest
and
what
the
court
described
as
a
“then
present
legal
interest.”
this
seems
to
exclude
illegal
interests,
future
interests,
equitable
interests,
contingent
interests,
all
of
which
it
seems
to
us
are
fully
met
in
terms
of
this
statute.
once
it
is
appreciated
that
the
statute
is
dealing
with
a
conflict
of
interest
situation,
i've
already
described
the
--
some
of
the
elements
of
the
offense
and
let
me
--
let
me
just
recapitulate
and
let
me
read
from
the
court's
opinion.
the
court
said
that
the
statute
is
limited
to
one
who
has
a
then
present
legal
interest
in
the
buying
corporation
and
does
not
include
one
whose
only
interest
is
in
the
outcome
of
what
may
have
been
an
illegal
and
illicit
plan
to
siphon
off,
for
his
personal
benefit,
property
of
the
boston
&
maine
railroad
through
the
medium
of
international.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
concept
of
using
international
as
a
medium
quite
clearly
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
bribe
case,
although
as
i
said
i
think
the
bribe
case
could
straight
bribery
--
straight
cash
bribe
could
still
come
within
the
terms
of
the
statute.
we
believe
that
when
one
construes
the
words
“substantial
interest”
in
the
context
of
this
statute,
it
is
all
important
to
appreciate
that
the
statute
is
a
conflict
of
interest
statute.
now,
the
arguments
i've
made
that
this
is
a
controlled
statute
that
is
an
antitrust
statute.
we
agree
that
it's
an
antitrust
statute
and
it
does
have
elements
of
control
but,
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
seems
to
us
quite
clear,
that
congress
was
dealing
with
the
problem
of
conflicts
of
interest.
it
doesn't
regulate
relationships
between
railroads.
it
regulates
relationships
between
railroads
and
people
who
deal
with
the
railroads.
and,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
the
all
important
factor
of
this
statute
in
appreciating
what
the
expression
“any
substantial
interest”
was
designed
to
cover.
the
word
“interest”
can
have
very
broad
meanings.
we're
--
appellees
suggest
that
we're
arguing
simply
an
alliance
of
general
concern
what
a
benefit
of
another
corporation.
we
don't
suggest
that
meaning.
we
suggest
the
meaning
which
is
quite
concrete
in
the
context
of
conflict
of
interest.
rules
as
to
the
conflict
--
as
to
conflicts
of
interests
are
well
known
in
the
law,
were
laid
down
many,
many
years
ago
are
traceable
to
the
bible
that
one
man
can
serve
--
cannot
serve
two
masters.
in
this
case,
it
seems
quite
clear
to
us
that
the
relationship
described
as
the
arrangement
and
scheme
put
the
individual
appellees,
mcginnis
and
glacy,
in
the
position
of
serving
two
masters.
this
is
--
this
context
of
conflict
of
interest,
if
there
were
any
doubt
about
it
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
it
seems
to
us,
is
quite
clearly
indefinitely
established
by
the
legislative
history.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
i
suppose
there's
no
importance
than
that
the
appellees
have
violated
two
counts,
two
--
i'm
sorry,
two
separate
statutes.
the
elements
are
different.
in
this
case,
it
isn't
necessary
for
the
government
to
prove
that
boston
&
maine
did
not
receive
a
fair
price
for
the
cars.
in
the
section
660
case,
we
would
have
to
prove
that
element.
all
we
need
to
prove
here
is
that
there
was
a
substantial
interest
and
that
there
was
no
competitive
bidding.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
and,
this
is
a
misdemeanor.
section
660
is
a
felony.
that's
the
basic
difference
between
the
counts.
and,
i
may
also
say
that,
as
construed
by
the
lower
court,
the
statute
virtually
serves
no
purpose
of
protecting
against
conflicts
of
interests
which
makes
this
matter
one
of
intense
concern
to
the
united
states.
going
back
to
the
legislative
history,
it
arose
out
of
--
the
statute
arose
out
of
disclosures
of
railroad
mismanagement,
manipulation,
and
intricate
web
of
financial
interlocks
of
all
kinds
between
railroads
and
banking
houses,
and
railroads
and
supply
corporations.
we've
set
that
forth
in
some
detail
in
our
brief.
president
wilson
delivered
a
message
to
the
congress
in
which
he
asked,
and
i
quote,
for
legislation
which
would
prohibit
“those
who
borrow
and
those
who
lend
are
practically
one
and
the
same,
those
who
sell
and
those
who
buy
the
same
persons
trading
with
one
another
under
different
names
and
in
different
combinations.”
now,
it
seems
to
us
that,
in
this
case,
we
have
the
buyer
and
the
seller
being
practically
the
same
person.
the
house
bill
which
was
passed
in
response
to
president
wilson's
message
simply
outlawed
the
holding
of
certain
positions.
it
prohibited
carrier
officers
from
holding
certain
positions
in
other
corporations.
when
the
bill
came
to
the
senate,
the
senate
approved
the
house
purpose
but
made
some
changes
in
the
bill.
with
respect
to
the
house
purpose,
the
committee
report
said
that
the
bill
was
“mainly
intended
to
arrest
the
practice
of
the
same
persons
occupying
conflicting
and
incompatible
relations
in
the
corporate
dealings
of
common
carriers
often
being
practically
both
buyer
and
seller.”
now,
the
senate
--
senate
changed
the
--
the
mechanics
of
the
bill.
instead
of
outlawing
the
holding
of
the
positions,
it
required
that
when
the
positions
existed
there'd
be
competitive
bidding.
it
then
noted
that
the
bill,
while
it
prohibited
certain
positions,
had
a
gaping
loophole
in
it,
and
it
added
to
the
house
bill
the
following
expression.
“has
any
direct
or
indirect
interest
in”
the
other
firm.
in
conference,
without
explanation,
that
expression
was
changed
to
“any
substantial
interest”
so
that
the
words
“direct
or
indirect”
were
replaced
by
the
word
“substantial.”
no
explanation.
it
is
clear,
however,
that
the
purpose
was
still
broad
and
the
--
we
quote
in
our
brief
from
the
supporter
of
the
report
before
the
senate,
senator
chilton
said
that
the
bill,
as
passed
as
it
came
out
of
the
conference
committee
“makes
it
impossible
for
officers
of
a
common
carrier
to
traffic
and
deal
with
those
who
conduct
both
sides
of
the
transaction
to
the
profit
of
individuals
who
may
conduct
the
negotiations.”
he
said
that
its
purpose,
and
i
quote
again,
was
to
enforce
“honest
open
methods
in
purchasing
and
constructing
by
common
carriers.
no
honest
management
has
anything
to
fear
from
this
section
but
it
has
a
severe
penalty
that
will
deter
the
dishonest
manipulator.”
and,
i
think
this
is
--
this
is
relevant
with
respect
to
the
inquiry
about
the
bribe
and
the
point
i
was
making
that
if
it
is
a
bribe,
one
does
not
conclude
that,
thereby,
it
is
not
covered
by
the
--
or
therefore,
it
is
not
covered
by
the
statute.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
the
antitrust
sta
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
let
me
say,
first
of
all,
that
section
660
which
is
the
embezzlement
and
conversion
statute
is
also
one
of
the
antitrust
laws.
it
was
section
9
of
the
--
of
the
clayton
act,
as
it
was
passed
in
1914,
when
this
bill
was
passed.
but,
in
addition,
this
bill
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
the
mere
fact
that
deals
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well,
sir,
i'll
come
to
that
but
let
me
finish
about
the
antitrust
aspect
of
it.
it's
this,
and
it
does
relate
to
the
so-called
anomaly.
even
if
the
international
company
did
not
cheat
the
boston
&
maine
railroad
in
this
transaction,
there
was
a
preference
given
in
the
sale
of
these
cars.
international's
competitors
were
deprived
of
the
fair
opportunity
to
buy
the
10
railroad
cars.
it
was
a
substantial
transaction.
railroads
at
the
time
this
statute
was
passed
and
today
are
charged
with
aggregation
--
of
being
aggregations
of
huge
amounts
of
capital.
they
sell
it
from
time
to
time.
they
sell
tracks.
they
sell
used
equipment.
they
buy
in
large
quantities.
and,
those
purchases
and
sales
could
have
a
definite
effect
on
the
industries
with
which
the
railroad
is
dealing.
in
this
case,
for
example,
it
appears
from
count
ii
that
a
mr.
bugby,
a
dealer
in
used
railway
equipment,
first
came
to
the
boston
&
railroad--
boston
&
maine
railroad
and
tried
to
get
an
option
for
$500,000
to
buy
these
cars
with
the
expectation
that
he
would
resell
them
to
the
wabash
railroad.
now,
he
was
turned
away.
employees
of
the
boston
&
maine
were
instructed
by
individual
appellees
not
to
deal
with
him
and,
to
this
extent,
fair
competition
was
interfered
with.
this
point
is
also
made
by
the
remedy
which
congress
applied
in
this
situation
a
competitive
bidding.
and,
the
statute
also
provides
that
if
anyone
interferes
with
that
competitive
bidding,
he
is
to
be
treated
as
an
aider
and
abettor.
we
derive
from
the
point
that
this
is
a
conflict
of
interest
statute
certain
conclusions.
first
of
all,
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
interest
which
the
individual
appellees
had
in
the
international
company
is
a
legally
enforceable
one.
obviously,
if
it
isn't
legally
enforceable,
it's
large
or
it's
entirely
because
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest
involved.
i
think
if
they
had
not
been
employees
or
officers
of
the
boston
&
maine
railroad,
it
would've
been
a
legal
interest,
a
kind
of
a
finder's
arrangement
that
they
would
find
the
property
and
it
would
be
resold
and
they
would
share
in
the
benefits.
the
same
thing
applies
to
the
stock
interest.
what
is
there
about
a
stock
interest
which
would
make
it
a
particular
concern
in
a
conflict
of
interest
statute
but
not
make
other
interest
of
concern?
it
can't
be
the
vote
in
the
corporation
because
the
conflict
exists
because
of
the
pecuniary
financial
benefit
which
the
officers
had
in
the
other
corporation,
not
in
their
power
to
control
its
activities.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
that's
correct.
it
can
be
fined.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
that
is
correct.
now
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well,
i
think
this
derives,
in
large
part,
from
the
concept
of
the
fictional
being
of
the
corporation.
i
think
that
congress
just
assumed
that
the
corporation
was
responsible
for
the
act,
that
the
corp
--
the
obligation
should
be
placed
on
the
corporate
entity
because
it
was
the
entity
which
would
have
to
have
the
competitive
bidding
and
that
it,
thereby,
followed
that
if
the
competitive
bidding
wasn't
held,
that
the
corporation
would
have
violated
the
act.
but,
the
fact
that
the
corporation
doesn't
hold
a
competitive
bidding
is
what
makes
the
individual
appellees
responsible,
if
they
are.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
the
statute
recognizes
that
the
corporation
is
a
corporation.
it
is
subject
to
find
--
fine.
the
individual
appellees
are
subject
to
punishment
for
up
to
a
year
in
jail.
now,
i
wouldn't
call
that
a
lighter
punishment.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
and
--
now,
the
question
arises
as
to
why
i
put
the
burden
on
the
corporation,
why
hold
the
corporation
guilty.
assume
there
isn't
going
to
be
a
heavy
fine,
which
i
think
is
a
fair
assumption
to
make
in
a
situation
where
the
carrier
has
in
fact
been
victimized.
the
district
judge
passing
the
sentence
would
not
apt
to
impose
a
heavy
fine.
but,
nonetheless,
the
factor
of
conviction
would
serve
some
purposes.
first
of
all,
it
would
alert
the
stockholders.
he
will
direct
their
attention
to
the
fact
that
their
corporation
had
been
guilty
of
violating
the
law
and
might
perhaps
spark
a
stockholder's
rebellion.
the
mere
fact
that
certain
individuals
had
been
convicted
would
be
something
that
the
corporation
might
be
able
to
pass
off
as
a
matter
in
which
they
have
not
participated,
they
had
not
been
in
on
the
defense
and
the
corporation,
itself,
had
done
nothing
wrong.
moreover,
we
suggest
that
placing
the
liability
on
the
corporation
makes
it
the
duty
of
all
the
officers
who
are
interested
in
the
corporation's
welfare
to
be
aware
of
the
fact
that,
even
though
they
may
be
convinced
the
corporation
is
not
being
cheated
that,
they
have
to
watch
preferences
in
the
sale
of
the
property
--
the
sale
of
railroad's
property,
and
this
brings
back
the
antitrust
purpose
that
because,
it
seems
quite
clear
to
me,
that
even
if
no
one
had
been
cheated,
the
individual
officers
would
have
an
interest
in
protecting
the
corporation
from
being
fined,
that
is
the
individual
innocent
officers.
they
would
make
it
their
business
to
find
out
the
activities
of
other
officers
as
an
ancillary
means
of
enforcing
statute
that
seems
to
me
to
be
reasonable.
i
might
point
out
in
addition,
that
ordinarily
we're
dealing
here
with
a
question
of
punishment.
is
it
wise
punishment?
and,
congress
doesn't
ordinarily
spell
out.
give
its
reasons
for
why
it
imposes
punishment
and
what
the
way
to
that
punishment
would
be.
in
this
case,
you're
faced
with
an
initial
problem.
we
say
the
corporation
doesn't
know
the
reason.
it's
an
unwitting
victim
bt,
the
fact
is,
if
you
are
going
to
impose
liability
on
a
knowing
corporation
only,
how
would
you
get
notice
to
the
corporation?
here,
you're
dealing
with
the
president
and
two
vice-presidents
and
if
the
statute
required
knowledge,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
would
be
the
perfect
situation
for
implying
knowledge.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
sorry,
i
don't
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
the
portion
which
requires
the
carrier
to
have
competitive
bidding
when
its
officers
or
other
employees
have
certain
positions
in
a
corporation
with
whom
the
corporation
is
doing
business--
with
whom
the
carrier
was
doing
business
to
an
amount
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
there
is
not.
we
place
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
the
words
“any
substantial
interest”
in
the
other
corporation.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
that's
right.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well,
sir,
this
--
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is,
yes,
there
is
an
interest
in
the
contract
but
there
is
also
an
interest
in
the
corporation,
and
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
they
did
not.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well,
what
there
is
--
is
an
arrangement
there
with
the
--
the
indictment
does
not
allege
a
contract.
it
alleges
an
arrangement,
under
which
these
individual
carrier
officers
were
securing
property
of
the
boston
&
maine
for
international
for
the
purpose
of
making
money
for
international.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
that's
right,
with
one
whole
scheme
involving
--
excuse
me.
involving
their
getting
the
property,
the
carrier
making
money
out
of
it
and
the
expectation
of
--
i
don't
mean
the
carrier.
i
mean
the
international
company.
and,
out
of
that
plan,
the
individuals
would
receive
substantial
money.
now,
we
--
since
there's
a
scheme,
co
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
it
does
and,
in
our
view
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
that's
correct
and
what
they
have
is
a
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
--
an
arrangement,
whereby,
the
corporation
is
being
run,
in
substantial
part,
for
their
benefit.
$480,000
are
gross
sales
in
the
year
in
which
this
sale
was
being
made
were
conducted
by
international.
that
was
almost
exclusively
boston
&
maine
property
and
these
three
individual
appellees
received
back
$71,500.
we
say
a
scheme
of
that
magnitude
of
that
type
gives
them
a
substantial
interest
in
the
international
company.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well,
the
record
doesn't
show.
there
--
it
does
appear
in
the
argument
on
count
ii
that
henry
mercy
was
the
sole
stockholder
of
international.
you
have
what
amounts
to
a
corporation's
soul
and
it's
true
that
the
individual
appellees
held
no
stock
in
that
corporation,
but
it
seems
to
us
that
you
have
here
an
arrangement
which
is
comparable
to
a
partnership,
if
you
will,
in
corporate
form.
and,
in
that
circumstance,
we
think,
certainly,
there's
a
substantial
interest.
these
officers
had
a
substantial
interest
in
the
corporation.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well,
if
we
prove
an
embezzlement
and
a
conversion,
then
section
660
does
cover
it.
that's
the
embezzlement
from
--
or
a
conversion
of
property
of
a
railroad.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
the
statute
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
the
sta
--
the
particu--
section
660
covers
embezzlement,
stealing,
conversion,
misapplication.
it
doesn't
specifically
mention
fraud.
and,
these
appellees
were
indicted
under
section
660
as
well.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
i'm
aware
of
no
other.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
i
recognize
that
and
our
--
it
is
for
this
reason
that
i
developed
--
we
developed
in
our
brief
the
notion
that
conflicts
of
interest
give
a
color
to
the
word
interest
that
is
quite
clear
and
i
might
quote
from
this
court's
opinion
in
pepper
versus
litton,
308
u.s.
295,
at
page
307
where
this
court
said,
for
that
standard
of
fiduciary
obligation
is
designed
for
the
protection
of
the
entire
community
of
interests
in
the
corporation-creditors
as
well
as
stockholders.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
creditor
relationship
is
within
the
community
of
interests.
it
is
an
interest
in
the
corporation
within
strict
legal
sense
by
this
court's
opinions,
and
we
are
asking
for
no
stretching
of
the
word
“interest,”
only
that
it'd
be
utilized
in
this
context
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
congress
was
dealing
with
a
conflict
of
interest
and
that
the
statute,
on
its
face,
deals
with
conflicts
of
interest.
in
this
context,
we
think
that
this
is
not
a
broad
meaning
of
the
word,
but
a
normal
meaning
of
the
word.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
pepper
versus
litton,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
it's
cited
in
the
boston
&
maine
brief
at
page
9.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well,
sir,
if
he
was
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
i
think
you
could
argue
that
he
was
an
agent.
the
indictment
did
not
go
on
that
premise,
and
then,
we
would
have
the
problem.
we
would
then
have
the
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes,
sir.
the
selling
--
the
selling
agent
is
covered.
but,
only
a
buying
officer
--
in
other
words,
on
the
part
of
the
carrier,
an
agent
in
a
particular
transaction
is
covered
but
he
would
have
to
be
an
officer
or
a
buying
or
selling
officer
on
the
part
of
the
carrier
and
the
other
corporation
in
order
to
be
covered
by
the
statute.
in
other
words,
agent
is
only
covered
in
the
carrier
positions.
in
addition,
you'd
have
the
problem
of
where
--
was
the
corporation
dealing
through
this
agent
as
an
undisclosed
principle,
which
would
again
raise
a
nutty
problem
of
how
you--
whether
the
statute
deals
with
indirect
relationships
of
the
statute.
