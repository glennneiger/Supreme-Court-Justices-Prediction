there
is
one
bribe.
justice
arthur

what
about
cash
payments?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
am
i
wrong
in
my
recollection
here
that
this
involved
a
cash
payment?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.

what
part
of
the
policy
they
took
the
violation
at

(inaudible)
and
if
i
have
a
contract
with
a
corporation,
after
20
years,
i
would
receive
50%
of
the
profits
of
that
corporation.
would
i
have
a
substantial
interest
in
that
corporation
by
your
definition
of
the
term?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
it
would
not?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
do
we
have
to
have?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
understand.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
understand
(voice
overlap)
because
you
were
mentioning
definitions.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
your
theory
is
that
i
would
have
to
have
a
stock
interest.
justice

(inaudible)
this
statute,
while
we're
dealing
here
with
a
corporation,
also
applies
to
a
partnership.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
there,
perhaps
what
would
you
do
with
my
example
with
a
partnership
where
you
have
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
50%
of
the
profits?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
we
deal
here
with
the
indictment
in
the
bill
of
particulars.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
we
don't
deal
with
count
ii.
i
think
you
correctly
pointed
out.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and,
as
i
read
the
bill
of
particulars,
it's
not
limited
in
time.
it's
arrangement.
i'm
looking
at
page
24
of
the
record.
and,
since
you
have
to
deal
with
it
on
its
face,
this
would
--
could
be
interpreted
as
a
continuing
arrangement
between
these
individual
defendants
and
international.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
agree,
mr.
proctor,
that
this
was
a
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
transaction
could
take
place
pursuant
to
continuing
arrangement
and,
when
you
look
at
the
bill
of
particulars,
what
we
have
before
us
is
a
document
which
looks
like
it's
a
continuing
arrangement,
out
of
which
this
particular
transaction
group.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
justice
goldberg's
point
is,
as
i
understand
it,
the
question
is,
a
single
transaction
can
be
--
can
be
violative
of
the
statute
if
there's
no
competitive
bidding,
but
there's
no
--
but
the
substantial
interests
could
be
a
continuing
substantial
interests.
i
mean,
let's
say
--
let's
say
these
individual
defendants
had
been
directors
of
international,
there'd
be
no
question
about
that,
about
the
guilt
of
the
boston
&
maine
or
about
their
guilt
on
the
basis
of
a
single
transaction.
is
that
right?
