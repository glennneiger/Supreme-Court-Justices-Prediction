justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
had
understood
that
this
statute
doesn't
apply
at
all
the
--
something
that
you've
ordered,
something
you've
subscribed
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
but
only
to
things
which
were
sent
to
you
involuntarily.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
so
far
as
the
statute's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
statute
does
not
apply
to
anything
that
anybody
has
to
be
sent
to
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
at
least
the
ones
that
the
page
--
put
under
page
four
of
government's
brief
i
guess,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
those
includes
germany,
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
germany,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
just
says
germany
in
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
those
such
as
japan
and
mexico?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
canada
too,
it
says
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
canada
and
not
england?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
was
an
amendment
to
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
a
speech
reprinted
in
the
time
were
put
in
a
letter
form
in
russia
and
sent
here
that
would
be
“communist
propaganda”,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although
it
appeared
in
the
new
york
times.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
that
mean,
for
example
if
john
jones
had
addressed
to
him
a
box
of
a
thousand
pamphlets
with
a
communist
manifesto
from
moscow,
it
might
be
that
the
post
office
would
see
how
many
of
those
he
dropped
in
the
mail,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
apply
it
to
what
he
is
mailing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
any
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
i
meant
was
you're
going
to
say
why
that
this
same
kind
of
law
couldn't
be
constitutionally
applied
to
people
in
this
country
who
want
to
send
this
same
politic
--
“communist
propaganda”
inside
the
country.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
other
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
understand
yet
on
his
mail
on
behalf
of
the
hanoi
government
from
south
vietnam,
it's
not
screened?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
being
screened.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
really,
really
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
indication
of
delay
before
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
screens
them
for
infections
of
these
things?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
screens
them
for
the
infections
from
these
things?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
(inaudible)
as
justice
clark
said,
they
all
get
these,
stacks
of
unsolicited
mail?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
don't
quite
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
government's
interest
in
picking
out
this
particular
rather
than
some
of
the
other
stuff
that's
just
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
other
--
i
wonder
though
--
i
wonder
if
it's
not
rather
the
burden
on
the
government
but
--
show
an
interest
since
you
concede
that
there
is
a
first
amendment
problem
involved
here,
why
do
you
approach
it
from
the
other
side?
i
think
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
we
have
to
impose
it
to
the
side
of
the
government
showing
that
this
--
this
was
justified.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
solicitor
--
am
i
not
right
mr.
solicitor
general
that
in
general
formulation,
where
we're
dealing
in
the
first
amendment
area,
what
we
have
said
about
the
required
governmental
interest
has
been
expressed
and
have
a
strong
language
as
of
compelling
interest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
we
have
also
said
of
course
that
obviously
there's
a
governmental
power
to
regulate
time
and
place.
but
is
that
really
what
this
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
that's
your
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
incidentally
is
a
special
form,
it's
not
like
the
card
but
when
they
fail
to
get
you
at
home
or
something
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
special
form.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
might
not
have
some
apprehensions
about
people
knowing
that
they
can't
from
an
open
card
that
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
“communist
propaganda”
is
being
addressed
to
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
suggesting
that
may
count
for
many
of
them
sending
it
back.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
just
suggests
mr.
solicitor
general
that
the
--
rather
than
expose
people
one
way
or
the
other,
why
that
citizen
to
that
kind
of
suspicion,
one
way
or
the
other.
the
different
--
not
the
show
of
or
rather
a
fair
interest
i
suggest,
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
(inaudible)
of
the
area.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
told
us
all
that
fellow
has
to
do
is
tell
the
post
office
he
doesn't
want
it,
doesn't
need
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
in
that
respect.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
got
what
he
wanted.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
understand
this
that
looking
at
footnote
2
at
page
4.
what
then
is
the
statutory
authority
for
making
available
of
the
customs
bureau
mail
that
comes
from
canada,
japan
and
mexico?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
understand
from
this
that
the
statute
--
this
statute
we're
talking
about
is
applied
to
that
mail?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
this,
as
i
understood
you,
all
these
so-called
communist
front
countries
and
communist
country,
this
is
a
matter
of
the
statute.
it's
mandatory
though,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
in
those
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
does
--
oh,
i
get
it.
now,
what
you're
telling
is
that
it
doesn't
matter
from
what
country
it's
mailed,
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
court
an
agency?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
we
can't
get
it?
