mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
might
be
useful
in
clarifying
the
issues
in
this
case
if
i
were
to
begin
by
giving
a
very
few
words
about
the
background
of
section
305
even
though
we're
concerned
directly
of
course
not
with
the
background
but
with
that
statute.
it's
not
necessary
to
go
farther
back
except
in
very
general
terms
than
to
the
period
during
and
shortly
after
the
world
war
ii.
during
world
war
ii,
a
program
of
screening
of
foreign
propaganda
at
that
time,
nazi
german
propaganda
was
instituted
by
the
executive
branch
on
the
strength
of
an
opinion
by
attorney
general
jackson.
that
program
continued
for
a
time
through
the
1940s
and
1950s
of
being
in
its
set
up
chiefly
by
executive
and
administrative
action,
and
came
in
the
course
of
time,
i
think
it's
proper
to
say
to
be
directed
at
the
communist
countries.
in
its
beginning
and
in
the
early
1950s
as
i
understand
it,
it
did
amount
to
a
total
blocking,
if
i
may
use
that,
suppression
if
you
will,
of
“communist
political
propaganda”.
there
were
many,
many
complaints
including
complaints
from
government
agencies,
educational
institutions
doing
work
at
one
time
or
another
for
the
government.
and
during
the
late
1950s
the
program
was
changed
in
such
a
way
that
the
addressees
of
“communist
political
propaganda”
were
as
or
whether
they
wished
it.
if
they
sent
back
an
affirmative
response
saying
that
they
did
wish
it
then
it
were
sent
to
them.
if
they
didn't
reply
or
replied
at
the
negative
then
of
course
it
was
not
sent
to
them.
that
state
of
affairs
continued
until
the
spring
of
1961
when
president
kennedy
terminated
the
entire
program.
he
acted
on
the
basis
of
opinions
from
his
attorney
general
that
there
was
doubt
as
to
the
statutory
base
for
this
program
and
from
the
secretary
of
state
as
i
recall
it
to
the
effect
that
this
was
impeding
his
efforts
to
workout
cultural
exchanging.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
matter
was
reviewed
by
the
national
security
of
council
and
it
concluded
that
the
statute
serves
no
useful
purpose.
the
matter
then
came
up
before
congress
in
connection
--
and
most
importantly
where
the
postal
service
and
public
employees
salary
act
which
was
enacted
in
--
ultimately
in
1963.
the
cunningham
amendment
which
was
proposed
in
the
house
by
congressman
cunningham
and
was
adopted
by
the
house
put
back
on
a
flat
measure
barring
the
delivery
of
“communist
political
propaganda”.
there
was
talk
of
some
exceptions
for
certain
institutions
but
generally
speaking
the
measure
was
an
absolute
prohibition.
mr.
archibald
cox
to
the
pay-raise
bill.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
one
that
we
all
finally
got
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
do
not
make
excuse
of
it
your
honor.
the
cunningham
amendment,
the
absolute
prohibition
was
very
strongly
opposed
by
the
attorney
general
or
the
treasury
or
the
post
office
and
other
interested
party.
but
i
would
emphasize
that
the
opposition
of
which
mr.
boudin
speak
was
to
the
cunningham
amendment
and
the
absolute
prohibition
are
now
the
logic
of
some
of
the
things
that
were
said
in
terms
of
our
commitment
to
the
pre-circulation
of
ideas
or
may
well
apply
as
a
matter
of
policy
to
this
bill
too.
but
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
department
of
justice
expressed
--
then
expressed
the
opinion
that
the
present
section
305
is
unconstitutional
or
that
congressman
walter
expressed
the
opinion
that
the
present
section
305
is
unconstitutional.
when
the
bill
went
to
the
senate,
it
was
proposed
to
be
substituted
for
it,
a
measure
that
essentially
stemmed
from
a
proposal
introduced
by
senator
butler,
which
would,
in
substance
reinstitute,
the
latter
phase
what
i
would
call
the
administrative
problem.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
ori
--
the
--
it
stemmed
from
a
bill
originally
offered
by
senator
butler
of
maryland,
i
think.
it
stated,
perhaps
my
memory
is
wrong,
it's
stated
in
that
brief
for
sure.
senator,
excuse
me,
i'm
--
mr.
boudin
tells
me
it
was
senator
bush
of
connecticut,
now
i
remember
he's
correct.
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
ultimately
there
--
went
through
the
congress.
the
measure,
section
305
which
is
reprinted
at
page
31
just
about
the
very
back
of
our
brief
and
i
think
it's
important
to
note
its
scope.
it
provides
that
mail
matter
except
sealed
letters,
in
other
words
unsealed
letter
which
originates
or
is
printed
or
otherwise
prepared
in
a
foreign
country.
now
i
understand
that
the
term
originates
has
never
been
applied
to
reprints
in
this
country
of
matter
that
was
originally
printed
in
foreign
countries.
i've
checked
just
now
with
the
representatives
of
the
post
office
and
that's
what
they
tell
me
to
be
the
case.
and
i
don't
believe
it
was
intended
to
apply
to
reprints.
for
example,
that
the
new
york
times
reprints
very
frequently
"communist
political
propagandas",
speeches
by
communist
officials
speakers
in
hanoi
or
in
moscow
and
no
one
has
ever
suggested
that
that
is
barred
from
the
mails.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
it
were
printed
in
pamphlets
form
so
that
it's
not
sealed.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
would
be
treated
as
"communist
political
propagandas".
there's
no
question
about
that.
if
there,
the
statute
then
goes
on,
i
emphasized
in
other
words
that
it
does
not
apply
to
things
reprinted
here
which
originates
or
which
is
printed
or
otherwise
prepared
in
a
foreign
country
and
which
is
determined
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
be
“communist
political
propaganda”
shall
be
what?
shall
be
detained
by
the
postmaster
general
upon
its
arrival
for
delivery
in
the
united
states
or
upon
its
subsequent
deposit
in
the
united
states
domestic
mails,
i'll
come
back
to
that.
and
the
addressee
and
--
the
addressee
shall
be
notified
that
such
a
matter
has
been
received
and
will
be
delivered
only
upon
the
addressee's
request.
so
that
everything
is
delivered
if
he
so
request
and
i'll
explain
the
mechanics
in
a
moment.
except
that
such
detention
shall
not
be
required
in
the
case
of
any
matter
which
is
furnished
pursuant
to
subscription
or
which
is
otherwise
ascertained
by
the
postmaster
general
to
be
desired
by
the
addressee.
in
other
words
the
theory
of
it
is
that
it
is
held
up
to
discover
the
addressee's
wishes,
if
you
have
reason
to
suppose
that
the
addressee
wants
it
either
because
it's
subscription
mail
or
because
you
have
some
other
satisfactory
evidence
that
he
wants
it,
then
you're
not
to
hold
it
up.
and
pursuant
i
think
to
that
same
general
theme
an
exception
over
on
page
32
makes
the
provisions
of
the
section
inapplicable
to
public
libraries
or
the
government
and
educational
institutions
of
higher
learning.
again,
i
presumed
because
it
is
supposed
that
those
institutions,
the
libraries
are
receiving
matters
of
all
kinds
and
presumably
wished
this.
and
i
passed
over
the
point
of
matter
shall
be
held
up
upon
arrival
in
the
united
states
or
upon
its
subsequent
deposit
in
the
united
states'
mails.
let
me
deal
with
the
problem
of
subsequent
deposit
first.
the
statute
as
written
apparently
applies
to
say
a
large
box
of
pamphlets
that
were
sent
to
this
country
from
moscow
or
by
freight
were
delivered
to
a
--
someone,
a
bookseller
in
this
country
and
by
him
deposited
in
the
mails.
i
want
to
emphasize
two
things
about
that.
in
the
first
place
as
a
practical
matter,
neither
the
customs
bureau
nor
the
post
office
has
discovered
any
very
workable
way
of
applying
the
statute
in
such
cases
and
it
is
hardly
ever
applied
to
any
such
material.
it
comes
in,
we
don't
check
the
mail
of
everybody
in
this
country
and
except
for
a
few
spot
checks
on
distributors
who
are
known
to
be
receiving
for
one
reason
or
another,
a
lot
of
material
of
this
kind,
the
mail
simply
goes
out
or
there
have
been
one
or
two
such
instances
and
the
statute
has
there
been
applied.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
suppose
he
would.
the
terms
of
looking
at
his
mail
of
course,
we're
talking
about
--
only
about
unsealed
mails.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
you're
talking
about
the
mail
that
as
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
man
i
described
as
bookseller
sends
this
out.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
i
must've
misled
your
honor
because
that
isn't
the
situation
that
i
was
trying
to
describe.
i
was
trying
to
describe
the
person
who
receives
something
by
express
in
this
country
and
who
is
in
the
business
of
circulating
these
publications
to
others.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
was
saying
that
the
postmaster
general
or
has
on
occasion
made
spot
checks
of
the
matter
deposited
in
the
mails
by
such
a
person
to
see
whether
he
was
obliged
to
provide
section
305
to
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
might
be
that
the
customs
bureau
would
discover
that
john
jones
was
getting
a
great
deal
of
this.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
it
might
then
say
to
the
post
office,
“john
jones
is
getting
a
great
deal
of
foreign
communist
propaganda,
you
would
better
see
whether
section
305
applies
to
it”.
and
in
that
event
the
post
office
might,
and
we're
talking
about
one
case
in
a
thousand
but
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
might
look
at
what
he
is
mailing
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
and
then
apply
the
steps
of
the
statute.
mr.
archibald
cox
his
mail
would
--
what
he
deposits
would
go
into
the
mail.
now,
i
want
to
emphasize
in
addition
to
the
fact
as
a
practical
matter,
this
is
very
intriguing.
second,
that
that
is
not
either
of
these
cases.
we
were
clearly
dealing
with
matter
from
the
foreign
countries
in
these
cases.
there's
no
complaint
here
about
domestic
matters.
second,
i
would
emphasize,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
case
of
domestic
mailings
is
quite
separable
in
two
respects.
in
the
first
place
i
think
that
there
may
well
be
questions
of
statutory
interpretation
as
to
just
what
is
meant
by
the
words
that
i
read
or
that
conceivably
could
have
a
limiting
interpretation
put
upon
them.
again,
i
would
think
that
the
constitutional
issues
with
respect
to
a
domestic
mailer,
domestic
sender
were
certainly
different
from
the
issues
with
respect
to
these
foreign
mailings
coming
from
overseas.
mr.
archibald
cox
because
i
think
that
the
foreign
--
well,
i
have
to
face
up
the
question
of
the
rights
of
the
recipients.
i
think
that
the
foreign
senders,
this
being
materials
sent
by
on
behalf
of
foreign
governments
do
not
have
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
archibald
cox
so
i
say,
i
have
to
face
the
problem
with
the
rights
of
the
recipients
and
i
intend
to
do
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh!
what
i
was
trying
to
suggest
was
that
the
man
who
mails
it
in
the
country
has
a
first
amendment
right.
but
the
man
who
mails
it
on
behalf
of
the
hanoi
government
i
suggest
has
no
first
amendment
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
when
he
is
abroad.
mr.
archibald
cox
at
the
present
time
the
south
vietnam
may
not
be
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
screened.
the
problem
there
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we're
--
let
me
describe
if
i
may
the
operation
of
this
statute
in
the
case
of
mail
coming
from
the
foreign
countries.
the
mail
arrives
in
large
sacks
that
we've
all
seen
on
the
post
office
truck.
frequently
an
entire
sack
will
contain
as
it
does
in
those
in
news
week
and
time
when
the
case
of
domestic
mail
or
copies
of
some
foreign
publication
possibly,
the
peking
review,
from
crocodile,
or
the
pamphlets
that
have
been
specially
printed,
are
all
such
unsealed
mail,
of
course
it's
likely
--
is
liable
to
go
through
the
customs
anyway
whether
there
were
this
statute
or
not.
not
all
of
it,
it
would
be
inspected
by
customs
in
the
absence
of
the
statute
but
a
substantial
part
would.
under
this
statute
when
the
mail
arrives,
let
me
suppose,
new
york,
i
--
the
--
everything
from
these
countries
that
are
listed
here,
and
i'm
now
speaking
of
russia,
is
routed
through
--
everything
unsealed
is
routed
through
--
is
dumped
out
from
the
mailbag.
the
post
office
looks
at
it
and
what
happens
to
be
sealed
in
the
mailbag
is
then
sent
on
its
way.
in
addition,
the
post
office
looks
to
see
how
much
of
it
is
addressed
to
exempt
people
and
that
is
immediately
screened
out.
to
give
you
an
illustration,
in
february
1965
that
there
were
1
million,
280
some
thousand
pieces
of
mail
that
arrived
in
new
york
city
that
might
have
been,
might
have
been
"communist
political
propaganda".
there
was
at
least
a
question
raised
about
that.of
those
sum,
a
137,000
were
found
to
be
addressed
to
colleges,
public
libraries
and
the
like
and
were
found
exempt.
this
left
that
some
11
--
1,150,000
to
go
to
customs.
they're
comparable
figures
in
the
record
in
the
fixa
case.
i'm
using
february
1965
just
because
they're
more
up
to
date.
but
there
are
comparable
figures
in
the
record.
of
that
1,150,000
that
went
to
custom,
760,000
pieces
were
found
not
to
be
“communist
political
propaganda”
and
380,000
roughly
were
found
to
be
communist
political
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
i'll
come
to
that
in
just
a
minute,
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
haven't
the
figure
on
new
york
alone,
the
total
number
of
employees
involved
in
this
program
as
i
saw
the
figures
in
the
last
appropriation
hearing
were
i
think
38
translators,
this
is
at
11
points
around
the
country,
not
at
new
york
alone,
you
might
figure
40%
roughly
in
new
york.
and
the
post
office
i
think
said
that
between
45
or
50
something
in
that
order
of
its
employees
were
involved
in
this
program.
so
the
total
is
somewhere
between
80
and
a
100.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
you
see
there
are
many
kinds
of
publications
that
they
know
from
lists,
what
they
are,
and
as
soon
as
they
know
the
name
of
it,
there
are
many
things
that
i
guess
they've
--
as
i
imagined
it
can
almost
go
like
that
and
i
suppose
occasionally
the
mistake.
now
of
the
380,000
that
were
classified
as
“communist
political
propaganda”,
a
card
was
sent
out
by
the
post
office
from
one
of
these
11
central
points,
not
from
the
local
post
office,
although
it
would
go
through
the
one
of
the
post
office
asking
the
addressee
whether
he
wanted
the
material
or
not.
if
he
said
it
--
if
he
marked
the
card
that
he
did
want
it,
it
was
then
sent
to
him
forthwith.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
the
average
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
it
would
simply
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
say
mail,
i
believe
to
be
“communist
political
propaganda”.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
wouldn't
say
what
it
was,
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
excuse
me.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
particular
publication?
i'm
told
that
i'm
wrong
about
that
and
that
it
did
identify
the
particular
publication.
i'm
surprised
as
you
can
see
but
i'm
sure
these
gentlemen
know
better
than
i
did.
my
impression
had
been
the
other
way.
i'll
check
during
the
lunch
hour
and
make
sure
but
they
must
know.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it's
made
--
it's
made
by
employees
of
the
customs
bureau
who
have
had
some
training,
some
instructions,
and
they
make
summaries
of
what
they‘ve
done
and
they're
reviewed
by
people
higher
up
the
line.
this
has
been
done
for
some
period
and
therefore
(inaudible)
undoubtedly
have
been
developed.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
they
report
to
their
superiors
what
they've
done.
if
they're
in
doubt,
they
may
go
to
a
superior.
if
that's
--
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
mr.
archibald
cox
what?
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
the
theory
of
the
statute
your
honor
really
can
be
said
in
any
sense
to
be
one
of
infection
of
anyone.
as
your
honor
pointed
out
earlier,
this
may
very
well
be
published
in
the
new
york
times,
the
peking
review
at
first
could
be
bought
on
the
streets
of
new
york.
i
expect
it
could
to
be
bought
here
in
washington,
on
cambridge,
any
number
of
places.
in
addition,
everyone
who
wants
this
is
free
to
get
it.
it
was
made
quite
clear
by
congressman
cunningham
among
others,
that
even
the
theory
was
not
one
of
infection.
it
was
as
i
shall
attempt
to
argue
when
i've
described
this
a
matter
of
balancing
in
a
way
that
i
think
is
fairly
small
on
either
side
of
the
interest
of
those
who
didn't
want
this
or
--
and
interest
in
not
subsidizing
foreign
governments
in
intruding
this
upon
people
against
the
interest
of
those
who
do
want
it
which
i
shall
have
to
agree
as
to
some
extent
or
cause
something
in
the
president.
mr.
archibald
cox
one
of
the
reasons
stated
in
the
debate
and
presented
in
the
hearings
by
congressman
cunningham
and
the
other
supporters
was
that
this
might
operate
as
a
lever
to
force
the
communist
nations
to
circulate
our
material
more
freely
or
whether
what
happens
to
the
things
that
we've
mailed
to
the
communist
government
seems
to
be
a
matter
of
some
doubt.
i
don't
--
i
certainly
have
no
evidence
that
this
has
operated
as
a
lever.
i
don't
--
and
we
don't
argue
here
that
this
should
be
justified
as
the
conduct
of
foreign
policy
by
the
congress.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
to
my
knowledge
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
want
to
say
just
a
few
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
--
from
england
it
would
come
through
in
the
ordinary
channel.
it
would
be
looked
at
only
to
this
extent.
the
question
then
would
be,
was
the
--
this
applies
mr.
chief
justice,
perhaps
i
didn't
emphasize
it
sufficiently
in
the
definition
of
foreign
political
propaganda
only
to
material
put
out
by
or
on
behalf
of
one
of
the
communist
government
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
a
communist
country
is
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
now,
if
it
is
--
yes,
i'm
going
to
answer
your
question.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
--
the
question
might
come
up
for
example,
whether
the
london
daily
work
is
published
by
or
on
behalf
of
the
soviet
union,
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
no
evidence
now
that
we
have
that
it
is
subsidized
by
them
and
that
london
daily
worker
comes
in
without
any
notices
of
this
kind
going
out.
so
that
the
same
kind
of
material
to
answer
your
question
directly
may
come
in
from
other
countries
unless
there
is
some
reason
to
believe
that
it
is
published,
put
out
by
or
on
behalf
of
the
communist
countries.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
has
to
be
made
by
the
customs
bureau
in
applying
the
statutes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
don't
--
i'm
afraid
that
the
investigation
is
rather
cursory
and
unless
they
would
find
some
affirmative
evidence
that
it
is
subsidized
then
it
comes
in.
as
i
say,
the
london
daily
worker
does
come
in,
there's
been
no
effort
to
extend
this
in
terms
of
things
printed
in
the
communist
country
of
--
there,
there
is
a
very
strong
inference
that
it's
published
by
or
on
behalf
of
the
communist
government.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
comes
from
some
other
country
of
--
unless
there's
some
affirmative
evidence
to
counteract.
then
the
practice
is
to
take
it
that
it
isn't
so
far.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
both.
that
is
to
say,
it
must
be
a
political
propaganda
as
defined
in
the
statute.
it's
a
very,
very
broad
definition
taken
from
the
foreign
agents
registration
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
quite,
quite.
on
the
other
hand,
remember
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
things
that
came
from
france
would
be
treated
like
things
coming
from
england.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
there
were
determination
made
under
the
trade
agreements
acts
and
other
legislation
that
brought
the
propaganda
within
the
definition
upon
political
propaganda
and
“communist
political
propaganda”
then
the
practice
would
change,
yes.
i
wanted
to
say
just
a
few
more
words
if
i
may
about
the
mechanics
of
this.
i
think
the
court
would
be
interested.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
has
been
--
mr.
archibald
cox
there
have
been
some
publications
of
where
there
was
evidence
that
there
was
a
subsidy
from
russia
or
some
other
communist
country
and
the
statue
has
been
applied.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
of
course,
all
that
is
done
is
the
receipt
--
all
that
is
done
is
that
the
recipient
has
sent
a
notice
saying,
“do
you
want
this?”
that's
all
that
happened.
mr.
archibald
cox
nothing
else
happens
to
it.
just,
“do
you
want
it?”
if
he
says,
“yes.”
he
gets
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
no
--
well,
if
i
could
finish
my
description
of
the
practice
your
honor,
you'll
see
that
it
does
not
go
in
any
black
book.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
--
for
a
time,
it
went
in
the
list
of
those
who
wanted
the
materials.
mr.
archibald
cox
no
doubt
about
that.
it
was
--
i
don't
think
there
is
any
evidence
that
it
was
used
as
a
black
book.
it
did
go
in
a
card
list
of
people
who
wanted
this
material,
does
not
now.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
know
evidence
that
that
list
went
to
any
committee.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
know
of
any
evidence
that
it
went
to
any
group
investigating
loyalty.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
were
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
can't
say
that
i
know
it
didn't
because
i
haven't
inquired.
i'll
get
the
best
information
i
can.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
could
represent
that
every
effort
was
made
that
it
wouldn't.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
it's
certainly
isn't
going
now
but
i
really
don't
think
that
there
is
any
basis
in
this
record
or
in
anything
that
has
been
quoted
with
respect
to
the
earlier
program
from
any
congressional
hearings
that
gives
any
basis
for
supposing
that
individual's
names
as
such
were
turned
over
to
be
investigated.
i
--
the
case
ought
to
be
decided
on
the
facts
and
not
upon
insinuations,
speculations,
but
certainly,
there's
no
such
proof
here.
it
has
been
requested
or
furnished
to
anybody.
i
can't
cover
every
unauthorized
thing
but
as
a
matter
of
government
policy
and
the
instructions,
that
is
the
fact.
second,
i
want
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
as
a
matter
of
determined
policy
there
will
be
no
reinstitution
of
the
keeping
of
a
card
file
or
list
of
people
who
wanted
“communist
propaganda”.
except
possibly,
and
this
is
only
possibly,
where
they
indicate
that
they
wish
their
names
kept
on
file.
i
add
that
possibly
only
for
this
reason,
today
they
are
not
kept
even
if
they
asked
it.
they
would
be
told
that
it
won't
be
kept.
but
there
have
been
two
difficulties
as
a
result
of
the
march
1st
order.
in
the
first
place,
there
is
the
provision
in
the
statue
with
respect
to
subscriptions.
i
--
and
the
difficulty
of
administering
that
is
very
great
because
there
are
many
things
that
are
stamped
subscription
copy
which
aren't
subscription
copies,
and
the
post
office
is
trying
to
find
a
way
of
dealing
with
that.
second,
there
is
the
provision
in
the
statute
which
requires
the
postmaster
general
not
to
detain
the
mail
when
he
otherwise
ascertains
that
it's
desired
by
the
addressee.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
and
i
suggest
the
postmaster
general
that
if
i
were
to
write
a
letter
saying,
“i
want
you
to
deliver
this
mail
and
i
want
you
to
keep
my
mail
on
--
my
name
on
file
so
that
you
can
deliver
it,”
then
there
might
be
a
real
question
whether
he
had
any
authority
not
to
do
that.
now
those
things
i've
stated
exemptions
just
to
be
--
or
to
protect
the
postmaster
general
in
considering
these
things.
i
repeat
categorically,
that
with
the
possible
exception
of
someone
who
says,
“i
want
my
name
kept
on
file,”
that
there
is
no
thought
of
reinstituting
the
old
system.
indeed,
the
judgment
--
that
part
of
the
judgment
below
that
enjoins
keeping
the
list
under
those
circumstances
is
objectionable
to
us
only
on
the
ground
that
it's
totally
unnecessary.
it's
not
anything
that's
of
any
practical
moment
in
the
operation
of
the
statute.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
precedent
directly
implied,
no
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
archibald
cox
either
way.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
recall
--
what
you
say
doesn't
remind
me
of
anything
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
not
except
for
the
--
well,
there
was
--
one
always
to
think
when
he
starts
dwelling
on
the
subject,
there
was
of
course
a
far
more
severe
censorship
during
world
war
i
that
was
sustained
in
the
burleson
case
but
we
do
not
contend
that
the
prevailing
opinion
in
the
burleson
case
any
longer
represents
the
dominant
view
of
constitutional
law.
indeed,
we
concede
that
the
first
amendment
has
some
application
to
the
handling
of
unsealed
mail,
second
and
third,
(inaudible)
fourth
class
mail.
but
i
don't
think
of
any
other
precedents.
now
with
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
and
of
course
we
have
something
somewhat
similar
in
the
case
of
the
foreign
agents
registrations
act
where
someone
in
this
country
as
agent
for
a
foreign
government
puts
out
this
kind
of
propaganda.
it
must
be
labeled
indeed.
i
had
--
connection
to
this
case,
a
copy
of
the
peking
review
which
has
that
label
in
it.
well,
that's
not
quite
the
same
thing.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
that
anything
quite
like
this
has
been
applied
to
obscene
literature.
alright,
in
coming
to
the
legal
issues,
i
do
want
to
stress
two
familiar
--
almost
paneled
but
nonetheless
vital
distinctions.
one
is
between
the
wisdom
of
legislation
and
the
constitutionality
of
legislation.
i'm
not
here
to
argue
nor
this
court
here
to
decide
whether
this
is
a
sensible
statute,
whether
it's
necessary,
or
whether
it's
wise
or
whether
it's
foolish.
under
our
constitution,
as
everyone
knows,
but
its
worth
recalling,
the
function
of
deciding
whether
a
law
is
why
this
for
congress
subject
to
the
president's
power
if
he
don't,
for
the
congress
alone.
and
the
second
familiar
precept
that
i
would
like
to
emphasize
is
difference,
if
i
may
put
it
this
way
without
getting
any
disrespect,
between
fancy
and
fact,
between
broad
and
some
--
therefore
somewhat
loose
characterizations,
and
the
actual
impingement
of
the
statute
on
some
concrete
interest
of
the
plaintiff
because
it
seems
to
us
that
viewed
in
terms
of
the
concrete
--
of
concrete
constitutional
adjudication,
section
305
is
really
a
rather
minor
regulation
of
the
handling
of
unsealed
mail
from
foreign
countries
developed
by
congress
to
accommodate
the
conflicting
interests
of
two
groups
of
citizens
both
of
whom
or
one
of
whom
has
to
yield
a
little
to
the
other
unless
the
essential
right
of
one
is
to
be
wholly
overwritten
by
the
other.
now
here,
one
group
of
citizens
is
worried
and
offended
by
the
receipt
of
such
unsolicited
propaganda
from
foreign
countries.
these
people
object
to
the
delivery
of
mail
to
themselves.
another
group
wants
the
“communist
propaganda”
delivered
to
them
in
regular
courts.
since
most
of
this
mail
is
unsolicited,
indeed
one
estimated
under
the
old
program
went
as
high
as
90%.
but
since
most
of
it
is
unsolicited,
there's
no
way
of
knowing
whether
any
particular
addressee
wants
the
mail
or
would
be
in
the
group
worried
about
it
and
offended
by
receiving
it.
and
in
section
305,
what
congress
in
effect
has
done
has
said,
“let's
pause
and
find
out
the
addressee's
wishes.
if
he
wants
it,
then
we'll
deliver
it
to
him.”
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
there
are
several
things
that
may
be
said
about
that.
one
is,
i
don't
quite
see
why
the
plaintiffs
are
anymore
entitled
to
put
a
burden
on
the
people
who
don't
want
it
other
than
the
people
who
don't
want
it
or
to
put
the
burden
on
the
plaintiffs.
after
all,
all
that
the
plaintiffs
are
being
asked
to
do
is
to
exercise
a
little
bit
of
patience,
a
led
pencil,
and
to
mail
the
postcard.
i
should
say
because
the
question
was
asked
of
me
before
and
i
got
the
verdict.
when
i
said
a
little
bit
of
patience,
the
best
information
i
can
get
is
that
the
total
delay,
may
average
about
two
weeks
as
a
result
of
this
statute.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true
but
it
doesn't
say
to
me
that
the
facts
that
we
get
in
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
indicates
that
there
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
it's
--
i
think
that
the
interest
that
the
congress
was
concerned
with
were
two
fold.
first,
that
this
was
mail
which
many
of
the
recipients
did
find
offensive
and
did
write
to
the
post
office
and
did
write
to
their
congressman
objecting
to
it.
second,
we
are
concerned
with
a
subsidy
going
to
the
benefit
of
those
who
are
publishing
this
on
behalf
of
a
foreign
country.
now
the
--
i
was
going
to
go
on
and
show,
i'll
state
it
now
and
elaborate
it
a
little
bit
in
a
moment.
the
only
--
the
affect
that
this
has
when
one
comes
right
down
to
it,
is
to
withhold
the
subsidy
of
the
--
generally
speaking,
second
and
third
class
mail
because
it's
unsealed
mail;
from
those
publishing
by
and
behalf
of
a
foreign
government
of
the
opportunity
to
intrude
this
upon
those
who
do
not
want
it
or
who
maybe
to
indifferent
indicate
that
they
do
want
it.
and
i
think
when
it
comes
down
to
justice
brennan,
when
one
is
all
done
with
the
way
it
operates
is
this.
on
the
one
hand,
there
is
some
delay
in
terms
of
the
recipient,
average
is
two
weeks.
on
the
--
also,
on
that
side
of
it
is
a
little
bit
of
nuisance.
they
do
have
to
fill
out
the
card
and
send
it
back,
but
that's
all
of
the
cards
are
then
thrown
away.
the
interest
on
the
other
side
that
congress
were
seeking
to
secure
were
first,
even
though
it
cost
of
money
to
see
that
everybody
got
what
he
wanted.
they
didn't
want
to
finance
foreign
governments
intruding
communist
propaganda
on
american
citizens
who
didn't
want
it,
who
weren't
--
who
didn't
desire
it.
and
in
the
course
of
doing
that,
they
not
only
avoid
it
giving
those
publishing
by
or
on
behalf
of
a
foreign
government
a
subsidy,
but
they
did
avoid
offending
the
sensibilities
of
those
who
didn't
want
this.
now
you
say,
“well,
we
all
get
a
lot
of
junk
mails.”
and
of
course,
we
all
do
get
a
lot
of
junk
mail.
and
perhaps,
this
is
something
that
maybe
proposed
as
the
plaintiffs
argued
by
saying,
“well,
the
amount
of
the
injury
is
no
greater
than
the
distance
from
the
mailbox
to
the
scrap
basket.”
but
i
suggest
that
the
--
that
that
is
not
necessarily
true.
one
of
the
letters
which
was
sent
in
to
the
post
office
indicates
that
some
of
the
people
who
received
this
mail
feel
a
good
deal
more
offended
and
a
good
deal
more
worried
by
the
recidivist,
junk
advertisements
they
get.
and
however
we
appraise
that,
isn't
it
fair
to
say
that
it's
just
about
of
the
same
order
of
interference
with
their
interest,
if
i
may
put
it
that
way
as
this,
is
interference
with
the
plaintiff's
interest.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
one
need
to
look
at
this
as
something
very
grave
either
way.
there's
no
real
suppression
of
this
material.
there's
no
effort
to
keep
it
from
circulating,
that's
not
what's
involved
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
attempted
to
state
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
attempted
to
suggest
that
there
were
two
interests.
i
don't
know
of
any
other.
mr.
archibald
cox
one
is
the
intrusion,
the
interest
of
the
same
character
as
the
court
held
was
entitled
to
be
taken
into
account
in
breard
against
city
of
alexandria.
now,
the
other
is
the
desire
not
to
subsidize
or
to
have
our
taxpayer's
money
used
for
the
benefit
of
--
essentially,
for
the
benefit
of
foreign
government.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
rate
is
not
paid
by
the
foreign
mailer.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
mail,
it's
fixed
by
their
government
and
paid
to
their
government.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
we
don't
get
any
revenues
from
what's
mailed
in
poland
or
russia
or
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
in
china.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
afraid
i'm
over
my
head,
i
didn't
think
it
was.
but
i
don't
really
get
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
really
know.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
its
--
the
mail
that
they
mail,
i
do
know,
we
get
no
receipt
from
it.
and,
i
don't
want
--
let
me
make
--
if
i
have
to
--
i
meant
to
as
i
stated
it.
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
we
are
saving
money
under
305.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
would
give
a
false
impression.
what
i
sought
to
emphasize
was
that
the
subsidy
didn't
go
to
the
foreign
country
from
which
the
mail
comes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
those
are
the
figures
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
come
from
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
that's
sometimes
true
mr.
justice
and
sometimes
not
true.
for
example,
like
when
i
was
attempting
to
state
how
this
acted,
i
just
gotten
down
to
define
it,
that
saying
that
in
february
1965,
there
were
200,000,
roughly
206,000,
not
want
it
and
154,000
want
it.
they
ran
to
percentages
so
far
as
i
could
make
out
of
one-third
to
one-half
in
each
group
bearing
from
time
to
time.
but
i've
--
my
comment,
implication
to
what
you're
saying
--
the
implication
to
what
mr.
justice
brennan
said
is
that
again,
i
think
if
we
put
this
in
the
proper
perspective,
that
this
isn't
an
effort,
it's
a
pressure;
that
it
is
sure
nuisance,
some
interference,
some
delay,
i
don't
attempt
to
deny
that.
also,
some
gains
on
the
other
side.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
that
area,
something
that's
a
fairly
minor
regulation
of
the
handling
mail.
and
it
may
be
important
here
that
this
is
mail.
it
seems
to
be
important
here
that
this
is
mail
coming
from
foreign
country,
sent
by
or
on
behalf
of
foreign
government.
when
one
takes
those
things
into
account,
the
most
i
need
to
show
i
think,
is
that
this
was
not
an
improper
choice
on
the
part
of
the
congress.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
i
would
--
i
would
think
that
this
should
be
taken
into
account
mister
justice.
if
my
view
of
the
order
of
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
correct,
if
we
look
on
this
in
terms
of
the
considerations
i
just
stated
on
the
other
side.
but
then
we
really
aren't
talking
in
the
order
of
suppression
of
speech.
we're
down
in
talking
about
questions
as
--
or
shall
a
picnic
be
permitted
to
use
that
part
of
the
park
or
somebody
be
use
--
permitted
to
use
that
part
of
the
park
for
a
speech.
and
i
take
it
in
that
area
that
there
is
larger
scope
for
the
police
power
if
i
may
call
it
that,
i
think
your
honor
sees
what
i
mean,
the
phrase
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
isn't
that
almost
all
theses
comes
to?
after
all
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
our
argument.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
sir.
and
i
--
let's
look
at
--
its
--
that's
our
argument
that
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
comes
down
to
that
sort
of
thing.
the
executive
branch
has
stated
it
before
the
congress
that
the
things
that
those
--
that
it's
expensive,
difficult
to
administer.
but
congress
passed
the
law.
it
is
our
duty
to
carry
it
out.
here,
let's
look
at
the
various
points
on
which
the
statute
may
impinge
on
first
amendment
interests.
but
first,
as
i
see
it,
one
can't
call
this
in
any
sense
censorship
or
suppression
of
what
maybe
sent
in
the
mail.
anything
may
go
into
the
mail
just
as
freely
as
before.
anybody
may
send
it
and
receive
it
just
as
really
as
before.
and
indeed,
that's
shown
by
the
fact
that
--
not
only
that
it's
delivered
but
if
it's
printed
in
this
country,
it
may
be
circulated.
if
it's
--
it
may
be
circulated
in
other
ways
than
the
mail.
now
second,
let's
look
at
the
thing
from
the
standpoint
of
the
senders.
anybody
may
send,
there's
no
restriction
on
who
may
send.
it
might
affect
--
the
only
people
affected
by
the
application
of
the
statute
in
this
case,
as
i
go
back
to
my
distinction
between
domestic
mailings
and
foreign
mailings,
are
people
out
of
this
country
who
are
dealing
with
material
published
by
or
on
behalf
of
a
foreign
communist
party.
even
those
people,
i
doubt
if
they
have
any
constitutional
rights
that
are
involved
here.
even
those
people
are
affected
only
to
this
extent
that
they
don't
get
the
benefit
of
having
the
mail
delivered
that
what
i
believe
is
cost
to
the
united
states.
to
people
who
want
or
don't
want
it
are
to
--
are
sufficiently
indifferent
so
they
won't
send
the
card
back,
that's
all.
otherwise,
the
sender
isn't
affected
in
anyway.
now,
let's
look
at
it
from
the
standpoint
of
those
to
whom
the
mail
is
addressed.
they
are
put
--
they
certainly
are
required
to
get
a
license
or
anything
like
that,
the
citation
of
thomas
and
collins
and
lovell
and
the
city
of
griffin
that
seemed
to
me
very
far
off.
they
are
required
to
mark
a
postcard
unless
they're
in
the
exempt
class.
they
are
informed
on
the
postcard
as
it
is
now
being
prepared.
i'm
not
certain
if
it's
in
use
but
it's
in
the
course
of
being
put
in
use.
they
are
requested
to
indicate
whether
they
want
the
material
and
i'm
told
that
it
is
customary.
i
was
in
error
earlier
that
it
is
customary
to
put
the
name
of
it
on
the
postcard,
whether
it
was
always
done,
i
can't
say,
but
it's
customary
to
it,
it's
intended
to
be
done.
then
they
have
a
chance
to
check
a
box
as
to
whether
they
want
this
material
or
they
don't
want
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
they
are
told
--
perhaps
i
should
read
the
instruction.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
special
form.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
special
form,
right
here,
i
had
one
in
my
pocket
earlier
but
--
mr.
archibald
cox
and
it
says
on
it
mr.
justice
--
mr.
archibald
cox
what?
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
it's
a
postcard.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
an
open
postcard.
the
form
says
on
it
that
all
previous
records
of
addressees
requesting
delivery
of
foreign
“communist
political
propaganda”
have
been
destroyed
and
no
records
will
be
maintained
in
the
future
on
addressees
in
this
regard.
if
you
check
box
one,
this
card
will
also
be
destroyed
and
you
will
be
contacted
each
time
foreign
"communist
political
propaganda"
is
addressed
to
you.
so
that's
so
far
as
it's
within
the
power
of
the
government
to
give
assurance
that
only
it's
doing
is
requesting
the
post
office
to
mail
this
to
him
or
the
government
has
given
that
assurance
to
i
sus
--
submit
that
assurance
as
it's
pledged
and
it's
good.
so
that
the
addressee
suffers
what
i
would
call
"one
delay"
which
i
think
is
the
most
serious
aspect
to
the
thing
and
two,
a
little
bit
of
trauma.
i
do
--
those
figures
you've
cited
justice
goldberg
and
the
comparable
one
as
to
which
i
referred
suggest
to
me,
the
trouble
really
isn't
very
much
because
a
surprising
proportion
of
them
have
been
sent
back.
and
that
one
of
the
things
that
interested
me
was
that
so
many
of
the
people
who
didn't
want
the
mail
took
the
trouble
to
send
the
postcard
back
because
if
you
don't
want
the
mail,
all
you
have
to
do
is
not
send
it
back.
so
apparently,
i
am
for
one
that
it
isn't
very
much
trouble
and
two,
that
some
of
theses
people
perhaps
had
rather
strong
feelings
about
whether
they
wanted
it
to
come
to
them
or
not
or
which
tends
to
fit
in
with
what
i've
said
earlier
about
the
interest
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
of
course
your
honor
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
believe
so
in
view
of
the
numbers
that
have
sent
it
back.
also,
there's
another
thought
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
but
look
at
all
those
who
do
send
back
if
they
want
it.
they're
just
about
as
many.
justice
goldberg
cited
as
an
instance
where
there
were
more
than
those
who
didn't.
in
addition,
it
seems
to
me
there's
another
element
if
we're
going
to
speculate
about
names
coming
to
be
known
and
people
identified.
if
i
live
in
that
kind
of
a
community,
i
wonder
if
i
wouldn't
worry
about
these
being
delivered
to
me,
just
as
much
as
i
would
about
sending
the
postcard
back,
delivered
to
me
without
--
in
the
absence
of
305.
here,
i
come
to
be
known,
and
i
regret
to
say
that
people
sometimes
have
been
known,
are
not
of
any
of
the
government's
doing
but
have
been
known
as
people
who
were
getting
socialists
or
communists
mail.
he
reads
the
daily
worker,
he
does
this,
he
does
that.
but
to
some
degree,
i
think
this
is
all
to
speculate
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
really
to
base
any
judgment
on
but
to
some
degree,
this
protects
people
who
could
say
to
the
post
office,
“don't
put
this
stuff
on
my
doorstep.
the
nosy
neighbors
are
going
to
draw
the
wrong
inference.”
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
much
of
these
--
mr.
archibald
cox
much
of
these
would
not
be
in
envelopes,
some
would,
some
would
be
in
closed
wrappers
like
the
new
republic
comes
in
and
nobody
could
tell.
other
of
it
i
think
comes
open
so
that
anyone
could
see
it.
there'd
be
all
kinds
mr.
--
mr.
archibald
cox
a
big
difference.
and
in
the
city
of
the
million,
except
for
a
few
people
in
the
apartment
house,
nobody
would
know.
in
the
village,
that
could
be
gossiped
both
from
the
card
and
from
the
getting
of
mail.
but
i'm
suggesting
that
if
we're
going
to
engage
in
that
kind
of
speculation,
there
is
the
man
who
didn't
want
it,
who
has
it
coming
to
him
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
and
his
neighbor
and
the
postman
know
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
the
person
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that
person,
if
i
get
this
and
my
neighbors
in
a
little
town
in
maine,
my
summer
neighbors
find
me
getting
this
and
they
draw
the
inference
that
because
i'm
reading
the
peking
review,
i'm
a
suspicious
fellow.
it's
not
the
government
who
except
by
delivering
the
mail
is
subjecting
me
to
that
it's
the
fellow
who
sent
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
that
would
be
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
everybody
went
in
and
told
the
government
he
didn't
want
it
then
apparently
that
would
hold
it
up
and
then
it
wouldn't
be
delivered.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
suppose
that
would
cost
to
a
good
deal
of
the
delay
that
i
mentioned
here
because
the
government
would
have
to
hold
things
up
while
it
was
checking
them
against
a
very
elaborate
list.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
wouldn't
quite
agree
with
your
honor's
characterization.
i
would
say
that
--
i
would
say
that
the
burden
of
indifference
is
shifted
by
the
--
yes,
the
burden
of
overcoming
indifference
of
inertia
is
shifted
in
this
statute
and
that
one
of
the
justifications
for
doing
that
is
as
the
congress
saw
it,
to
stop
subsidizing
foreign
countries
that
want
to
take
advantage
of
this
government
subsidy
and
aid
in
overcoming
the
burden
of
indifference,
and
the
government
--
congress
has
said
in
effect,
“well,
we're
not
going
to
aid
you
to
overcome
the
burden
of
indifference
but
we're
going
to
find
out
whether
the
addressee
wishes.”
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
don't
--
i've
said
two
things,
justice
black.
one
is
that
the
motive
of
some
of
the
people
who
voted
for
legislation
certainly
is
not
the
standard
by
which
this
court
should
do
its
constitutionality.
mr.
archibald
cox
no
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
--
no,
i
don't.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
cunningham
didn't
get
his
way.
i
think
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
he
didn't
get
the
suppression
part
of
it.
that's
just
it.
i
think
that
the
motive
of
some
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
of
the
congressmen
--
mr.
archibald
cox
he
was
content
to
get
what
he
did.
in
fact,
he
claimed
as
--
he
claimed
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
a
very
familiar
thing
for
members
of
congress.
if
i
might
just
say
one
sentence
to
answer
justice
black,
seriously
justice
black,
i
do
think
that
there
were
people
who
as
they
voted
this
through
the
house
wanted
to
stop
distributing
this.
mr.
boudin
quotes
from
the
end
of
his
reply
brief
as
if
it
were
a
description
of
the
statute,
what
they
said
about
the
house
bill?
it
did
put
a
stop
to
distributing
it,
no
doubt
about
that.
but
they
didn't
get
their
word
and
there
must
have
been
people
in
the
congress
who
strongly
objected
to
the
suppression.
there
were
probably
people
in
the
congress
who
objected
to
the
whole
thing.
and
where
the
place
of
balance
was
dragged,
was
not
in
terms
of
suppressing
any
of
it.
i
most
earnestly
submit
that
it
circulate,
it
circulates
freely
except
for
the
delay
and
the
nuisance.
and
in
the
end,
i
don't
think
this
is
realistic.
whatever
one
may
think
is
a
matter
of
political
principle
or
whatever
one
may
think
in
terms
of
the
symbolism,
stands
behind
this
or
whatever
one
may
think
would
be
a
good
place
for
congress
that
are
otherwise,
that
there
is
no
escape
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
adjudication.
from
looking
at
what
it
actually
does,
and
i
think
it
comes
down
to
the
things
that
i
have
identified
i
think
to
decide.
thank
you.
