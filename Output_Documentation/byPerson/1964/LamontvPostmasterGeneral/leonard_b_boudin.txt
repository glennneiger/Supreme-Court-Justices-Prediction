of
section
305
of
the
postal
service
and
public
employees
salary
act
of
1962.
is
--
section
3005
authorizes
the
postmaster
general
directs
them
in
fact
not
to
deliver
mail
except
sealed
mail
which
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
has
determined
to
be
"communist
political
propaganda"
unless
the
addressee
request
the
delivery
of
such
mail.
there
are
exceptions
namely,
federal
agencies,
there's
government
agencies,
public
libraries
and
certain
institutions
of
higher
learning.
the
appellant,
doctor
lamont
is
a
writer
and
publisher
of
pamphlets
and
other
materials
dealing
with
public
affairs.
in
july
of
1963,
he
received
a
notice
from
the
postmaster
general
in
the
form
set
forth
at
page
13
of
the
record
in
which
he
was
called
that
a
certain
matter
which
had
been
determined
to
be
"communist
political
propaganda"
namely
an
issue
of
the
peking
review,
chinese
publication
had
been
--
had
arrived
and
that
it
would
not
be
delivered
to
him
unless
he
requested
his
delivery
by
returning
that
notice.
dr.
lamont
instituted
this
suit
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
the
statute,
this
provision
of
the
statute
as
unconstitutional
for
reasons
which
i
shall
indicate
and
this
postmaster
general
responded
by
saying
that
he
regarded
the
suit
as
a
statutory
notice
of
a
desire
to
receive
this
material
therefore
all
“communist
propaganda”
so-called,
or
court
found
literature
would
be
delivered
to
dr.
lamont
and
the
postmaster
general
moved
to
dismiss
the
suit
as
moot.
following
a
longstanding
policy
indicated
in
the
record
of
attempting
to
avoid
a
constitutional
test
to
these
issues.
the
district
court
by
a
divided
vote
by
the
statutory
court
upheld
the
motion
to
dismiss
as
moot
on
the
ground
that
the
basic
injury,
the
failure
to
receive
unless
the
request
was
made,
no
longer
existed
since
the
request
had
been
made.
and
that
the
other
claim
that
the
list
of
persons
which
historically
had
been
kept
which
constitutes
20,000
a
number
at
the
present
time,
according
to
the
record,
of
people
desiring
to
receive
"communist
political
propaganda"
was
not
a
really
dangerous
list
which
could
afford
any
problem
to
the
addressee.
while
this
case
was
pending
on
appeal
to
this
court,
a
different
district
court
in
the
companion
case
in
california,
came
to
a
different
conclusion,
holding
that
the
issues
were
not
moot,
holding
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
as
an
impairment
of
the
right
of
communication.
and
holding
that
the
list
was
a
list
of
what
might
be
called
subversive
persons
or
persons
associated
with
them
and
therefore
presented
a
deterrent
to
people
requesting
such
materials.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
shall
address
myself
to
that
your
honor.
yes,
while
--
shortly
after
the
fixa
case
was
decided,
the
postmaster
general
for
reasons
that
we
don't
question
at
all
in
terms
of
propriety,
acquiesced
in
our
view
that
the
list
at
least
were
very
harmful
or
might
be
harmful
and
adopted
a
new
procedure
under
which
he
destroyed,
he
says
he
did
and
we
accept
his
word,
the
existing
list
of
names
of
people
desiring
such
“communist
propaganda”.
thereby,
also
revising
the
procedure
so
that
nobody
could
receive
the
mail,
by
making
a
single
request
because
for
each
piece
of
so-called
“communist
political
propaganda”
that
arrives
in
the
post
office,
a
separate
notice
is
sent
to
the
individual
and
that
individual
whom
we're
sending
that
notice
requesting
the
mail.
if
he
says
he
wants
it
and
the
next
piece
of
propaganda
arrives,
he
must
still
send
in
another
notice
otherwise,
the
list
would
have
to
be
kept.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
says
he
doesn't
want
the
propaganda,
then
a
list
is
kept,
this
time
what
we
will
call
a
non-subversive
list
of
people
who
don't
want
“communist
political
propaganda”
and
therefore
will
never
receive
them.
the
action
taken
by
the
postmaster
general
of
course
eliminates
the
issue
of
mootness
which
is
not
discussed
in
the
government's
brief
which
i
shall
not
address
myself
to.
it
does
however
still
pose
a
very
serious
question
which
we
address
ourselves
in
this
rather
brief
argument
to,
namely
whether
the
statute
does
not
in
terms
of
purpose,
effect,
and
language
directly
as
in
speiser,
not
indirectly
as
the
--
such
case
as
the
aca
against
douds
according
to
the
court's
holdings
affect
and
abridged
freedom
of
communication.
i
shall
obtain
in
a
few
minutes
to
the
arguments
made
by
the
solicitor
general
because
they
must
be
met
here.
but
let
me
begin
preliminarily
by
saying
that
we
think
that
the
statute
which
allows
the
government
to
say
that
certain
kind
of
material
coming
from
abroad
will
come
in
without
any
deterrent,
without
any
request,
without
any
delay,
without
any
screening.
let's
take
the
new
statesman
which
soundly
contains
socialist
propaganda
in
which
on
the
other
hand,
says
that
material
which
is
“communist
propaganda”
must
be
screened,
must
be
read,
must
be
translated,
must
be
determined
to
be
whether
it's
“communist
propaganda”
or
not
and
then
cannot
be
delivered
unless
a
request
is
made
by
the
individual
that
that
does
basically
interfere
as
the
attorney
general
himself
said
to
his
representatives
when
this
matter
came
before
the
congress,
it
does
interfere
with
our
conception,
our
tradition
of
an
open
society.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
latter
as
well,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
exactly,
your
honor.
now,
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
difficulty
is
that
with
the
elimination
of
the
list,
your
honor,
you
no
longer
had
a
subscription
technique
as
the
solicitor
general
points
out
in
his
brief
quite
correctly.
you
can't
tell
anymore
whether
somebody
has
subscribed
because
the
post
office
doesn't
keep
a
regular
list.
when
the
post
office
had
a
list
of
the
people
who
wanted
the
propaganda,
‘then
they
would
know
who
wanted
it
by
subscription
or
otherwise.'
now,
it
can't
be
told.
of
course,
solicitor
general
says
perhaps
the
post
office
will
figure
out
the
way
to
handle
that.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
in
terms,
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
precisely,
in
terms.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
now,
what
we
think
is
the
basic
defect
to
the
statute
is
that
it
cuts
under
the
principle
that
the
government
must
not
determine
or
must
not
facilitate
the
reading
of
particular
matter
and
to
discourage
in
anyways
slightly
or
greatly
the
reading
of
other
matter.
and
that
this
one
is
in
a
sense
undercuts
the
principles
set
forth
in
such
opinions
as
baits,
where
the
court
talked
about
the
consent
of
an
informed
citizenry
because
the
informed
must
refer
to
information
and
the
information
is
not
to
be
the
information
which
the
government
wishes
to
discourage
or
encourage.
of
course,
as
the
court
has
held
in
martin
against
struthers,
the
right
to
read
and
to
receive
letter
to
is
correlative
to
the
right
to
write
it
and
to
distribute
it.
now,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
there
are
delays
which
are
inherent
in
this
system
which
will
be
discussed
by
mr.
krause
in
the
next
case,
the
whole
problem
was
translation
and
i'll
be
judging
it,
a
judging
which
the
customs
admit
is
an
imprecise
one.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
in
english,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
--
that
one
is
in
english
but
many
come
in
of
course
in
other
languages.
we
think
this
is
analogous
to
a
licensing
scheme
of
a
kind
discussed
by
the
court
in
the
lovet
--
in
lovell
against
griffin,
in
thomas
against
collins,
and
in
grosjean
except
here
we
have
the
unusual
situation
of
the
licensee
being
the
leader,
the
audience
as
if
you
were
licensing
the
people
who
could
attend
their
meeting
instead
of
the
license
that
required
other
person
conducting
the
meeting
and
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
there
is
a
license
in
the
sense.
it's
a
license
which
you
will
get.
but
the
court
has
spoken
about
licenses
which
you
will
get
also
as
being
improper
(inaudible)
--
infringements
upon
speech.
you
will
get
it
if
you
make
your
request
for
it
and
of
course
this
does
cut
right
into
the
question
of
the
writer
of
anonymity
of
the
reader,
a
right
which
the
court
held
existed
with
respect
to
the
distributor
of
literature
and
kelly
against
california,
circumstances
far
less
invidious
because
they
didn't
involve
the
question
of
“communist
political
propaganda”.
now,
the
government's
response
which
of
course
is
a
critical
thing
here
is
two
things.
first,
the
government
says
there's
only
a
momentary
listing
and
then
it
says
there
is
not
the
slightest
reason
to
(inaudible)
--
to
anticipate
government
reprisal
because
a
person
is
on
such
a
list.
and
it
questions
whether
there
would
be
much
community
reprisal
either
if
these
facts
are
known.
our
answer
is
that
historically,
under
the
prestatutory
program
which
was
eliminated
by
the
order
of
president
kennedy
and
then
resulted
in
the
statute,
the
names
of
person's
requesting
the
literature
were
turned
over
to
various
congressional
committees
and
then
of
course
generally
speaking,
there
has
been
unfortunately
in
the
last
two
decades
a
loyalty
security
programs
interest
in
the
reading
habits
of
american
citizens
and
this
we
have
documented.
the
fact
that
there
is
only
a
momentary
request
for
the
literature,
doesn't
exclude
the
possibility
that
the
name
will
be
noted
somewhere
because
the
post
office
may
revert
to
its
old
practice,
has
changed
its
practice
at
least
twice
in
this
litigation,
the
moments
are
repeated
moments
instead
of
the
single
moment
that
we
had
when
you
could
ask
for
all
the
literature
because
it
is
not
true
that
you
can
now
ask
for
all
“communist
propaganda”.
you
must
ask
for
the
particular
item.
the
customs
bureau
which
also
has
this
literature
and
which
has
done
most
of
the
revelations
to
congressional
committees
in
the
past
are
the
names
of
addressees
makes
no
such
commitment
as
the
postmaster
general
makes
in
these
cases.
and
more
important,
there
is
no
assurance
to
the
public.
i
think
the
solicitor
general
was
in
error
in
his
brief
and
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
he
weren't
here.
no
assurance
to
the
public
in
the
form
of
a
writing
or
otherwise
that
the
list
of
names
will
not
be
kept
even
if
there
weren't
such
an
assurance.
surely,
the
--
there
are
many
people
in
this
country
who
are
sufficiently
timid
and
with
some
justification
i
fear,
not
to
want
to
ask
the
government.
the
government
ascend
what
is
labeled
“communist
political
propaganda”
because
of
the
fear
of
consequences.
now,
we
think
that
under
--
none
of
the
standards
which
the
various
members
of
the
court
have
suggested
can
there
be
a
justification
for
what
the
government
has
done
here
in
the
statute.
whether
the
standard
be
--
that
suggested
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
bates
of
mr.
justice
black,
that
first
amendment
rights
are
beyond
abridgement
or
whether
it
be
the
one
suggested
on
the
other
circumstances
in
bridges
and
in
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
harlan
in
roy,
namely
a
paramount
government
interest.
and
in
bridges,
greatest
abuses,
endangering
paramount
interest
or
whether
even
be
the
balancing
theory
which
has
been
suggested
in
such
cases
in
barenblatt.
under
none
of
these
circumstances
do
we
think
there
can
be
a
justification
bearing
in
mind
the
government's
very
fair
concession
at
page
23
of
its
brief
that
we
do
not
suggest
says
the
government
than
any
such
large
and
important
public
interest
are
involved
as
with
--
support
a
true
invasion
of
freedom
to
speak
or
publication
or
a
freedom
to
hear,
read
and
learn.
it
says
no
such
interests
to
implicate
on
either
side.
but
we
think
the
key
here
is,
are
there
large
and
important
public
interest
which
would
justify
any
infringement,
large
or
small
upon
freedom
of
speech,
freedom
of
the
press.
the
government
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
(inaudible)
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
except
we
must
remember
that
as
a
matter
of
practical
application
we're
now
dealing
with
either
mail
requested
by
people
and
certainly
mail
desired
by
people.
i'll
agree
if
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
if
it's
desired
they
get
it
but
only
if
they
make
the
formal
request,
not
if
they
just
desire
it.
the
man
who
wants
the
literature
which
is
then
coming
to
him,
day
after
day
or
month
after
month,
must
with
(inaudible)
--
in
order
to
get
each
piece
of
literature,
send
in
a
separate
card
to
the
post
office
department.
he
may
want
the
literature
after
he's
read
the
first
issue
but
he
doesn't
get
the
next
issue
unless
he
asks
for
it.
and
he
hasn't
got
the
next
because
he
asked.
so
this
is
directed
against
people
who
desired
the
literature
and
who
are
compelled
that
they
wanted
to
make
the
request.
have
i
put
the
thing
in
context
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
why
now
i'm
going
to
come
to.
is
there
really
--
is
there
really
a
need
for
the
protection
of
people
who
don't
want
it
and
is
it
a
need
which
can
justify
making
it
difficult
or
creating
a
problem
for
people
who
do
want
it.
something
like
the
schneider
case,
the
cleaning
of
the
streets,
the
dating
speech
of
the
literature,
only
to
say
that
those
people
who
do
want
it
and
a
larger
number
want
it
as
it
indicated,
but,
those
people
who
want
it
are
to
delay
and
sometimes
not
--
and
send
in
the
request
for
literature
because
there
are
few
people
who
may
not
want
it.
the
government
--
i
think
that
is
a
matter
of
principle
that
those
people
who
don't
want
it
can
reject
it
and
those
people
who
do
want
it
should
not
be
compelled
to
make
the
formal
request
for
"communist
political
propaganda".
there
is
by
the
way
practically
no
evidence
that
people
who
don't
want
it
are
really
disturbed
when
it
arrives.
i
will
deal
with
the
alternatives
which
i'll
indicate
in
a
few
minutes.
but
as
i
looked
at
the
government's
brief,
hearings
conducted
in
1955
before
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities
where
the
basis
for
some
indication
that
a
few
people
didn't
want
it.
and
the
customs
people
and
the
treasury
people
testified
in
the
congressional
committee
hearing
after
the
statute
and
doing
dependency
of
it.
that
very
few
complaints
actually
came
in
to
people
who
didn't
want
it.
but
the
basic
principle
is,
are
we
to
take
away
for
those
people
who
have
a
right
to
receive
viewpoints
from
every
side.
take
away
their
right
to
receive
it
with
equal
facility
because
it
is
of
a
special
kind,
but
remember
we're
only
excluding
one
kind
of
propaganda
coming
as
political
propaganda
and
because
other
people
may
have
their
feelings
hurt,
so
i'd
questioned
if
they
get
it.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
exactly,
that's
exactly
the
alternative
thing
we
would
suggest,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
exactly.
the
individual
under
39
cfr
.44
--
44.1
can
send
in
a
single
notice
to
the
government
saying,
"don't
send
me
for
the
next
two
years,
probably
forever,
but
two
years."
what
the
regulation
says,
any
formed
propaganda
and
he
will
not
get
it.
that
brings
us
on
this
aspect
of
the
case
to
what
the
court
has
said
so
often
that
in
dealing
with
a
federal
statute,
suppose
in
a
state
statute
also,
impairing
freedom
of
speech,
the
question
is,
is
there
a
reasonable
alternative
to
a
drastic
statute
and
the
reasonable
alternative
lies
in
the
exercise
by
the
unwilling
individual
if
there
really
is
such
a
person
of
his
rights
under
this
regulation.
and
i
may
say
that
congressman
walter
who
as
the
court
knows
was
no
active
friend
of
communism
and
with
--
the
greatest
one
i
have
ever
made
and
was
chairman
of
the
house
community
on
un-american
activities,
although
he
began
by
considering
a
statute
of
this
kind,
as
a
very
good
lawyer,
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
and
opposed
this
particular
section
which
was
written
in
by
senate
--
congressman
cunningham
and
instead
proposed
the
alternative
method
which
appears
with
respect
to
obscenity
statutes
in
section
307
of
the
same
statute
and
as
--
in
our
replied
brief
and
in
the
appendix,
namely
notifying
the
public
by
individual
notices
and
in
the
post
office
of
the
fact
that
such
propaganda
comes
in
and
it
can
always
be
returned
if
they
don't
want
it
to
the
post
office
without
charge.
such
is
the
provision
we
now
have
in
the
law
with
respect
to
obscene
literature
which
surely
is
more
offensive,
i
--
well,
as
at
least
it's
offensive
as
so-called,
“communist
political
propaganda”.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
that
your
honor.
but
they
certainly
can
send
this
back.
now,
we
come
to
the
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
please?
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
please
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
that
will
also
be
barred.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
barred,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
should
say
because
the
--
it
originates
in
a
foreign
country,
in
a
communist
country.
it
would
still
be
covered
by
it.
the
question
would
be
term
--
meaning
of
the
word
origin.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
would
say,
he
still
has
to
give
credit
to
the
author
or
the
government
would
give
credit
to
the
author
in
determining
whether
or
not
it
was
communist
propaganda.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
that's
quite
right
your
honor.
the
government
has
a
--
it
doesn't
operate
on
the
theory
of
control
over
the
mails
really,
it's
very
well
aware
of
the
dissents
in
burleson
and
in
similar
cases.
the
government
says
in
addition
to
the
argument
which
is
made
with
respect
to
the
sensibilities
of
the
individual,
that
why
should
we
pay
for
“communist
political
propaganda”,
this
is
i
must
say
an
argument
that
was
reverted
by
the
administration
in
opposing
this
particular
law,
because
there's
nothing
that
i
can
say
that
can
equal
the
remarks
that
were
made
by
the
postal
authority,
the
attorney
general's
office
and
customs
in
opposing
the
constitutionality,
the
workability,
the
fairness
and
in
claiming
--
asserting
the
vagueness
of
this
particular
statute.
and
the
government
answered
to
this
subsidy
argument
before
the
congressional
committee.
post
office
committee
said
as
follows
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
administration,
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
opposed
the
statute
as
unconstitutional.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
deputy
--
then
deputy
attorney
general
white,
assistant
attorney
general
katzenbach,
mr.
doyle,
the
postmaster
general.
now
let
me
be
perfectly
fair
and
say
that
what
they
opposed
was
the
original
cunningham
bill,
which
would
have
--
which
indicates
the
purpose
of
congressman
cunningham
in
the
statute
which
would
have
prescribed
all
“communist
propaganda”
from
coming
in,
sealed
or
unsealed
and
making
no
exceptions.
but
the
government's
opposition
as
expressed
through
the
witnesses
whom
i've
indicated
was
an
absolute
opposition,
not
limited
to
the
terms
of
the
bill
and
relying
upon
the
basic
principles
which
the
court
has
set
forth
in
--
with
respect
to
free
trade
and
ideas.
now
in
the
course
of
that
testimony
mr.
justice
black,
the
government
pointed
out
that
you
cannot
treat
the
mail
coming
in,
in
isolation
and
assumed
that
we
are
giving
a
subsidy
to
foreign
“communist
propaganda”
because
it
is
part
of
a
reciprocal
arrangement
under
the
universal
postal
convention
under
which
the
sending
country
gets
the
postage
and
the
receiving
country
does
the
delivery.
and
of
course
we
send
out
much
more
to
the
so-called
communist
bloc
and
therefore
we
receive
it,
the
united
states
much
more
postage
than
they
receive.
but
i
don't
regard
that
frankly
as
the
critical
argument
here,
nor
do
i
regard
the
practical
argument
which
is
now
available
to
us
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
given
by
the
post
office
officials
and
customs
officials
that
this
program
is
costing
a
half
a
million
dollars
a
year
even
if
we
put
aside
the
fact
that
instead
of
one
letter
there
are
sometimes
three
that
“communist
propaganda”
comes
in.
the
notice
goes
back
and
the
mail
goes
out,
a
half
a
million
dollars
for
the
purpose
of
saving
very
little
literature
from
going
out.
i
consider
even
that
argument
not
an
important
argument
here
and
the
basic
one
is
the
one
that
was
made
by
mr.
justice
brandeis
dissenting
in
burleson
that
was
made
in
the
hannegan
case
that
was
made
--
that
is
suggested
in
the
dissent
of
mr.
justice
harlan.
namely
that
you
cannot
use
the
subsidy
theory,
the
second
class
mail
theory
as
it
was
in
order
to
screen
political
or
economic
content.
you
cannot
say
that
we
will
let
the
second,
because
of
the
subsidy
argument
we
will
let
the
london
economists
come
through
and
we
will
not
let
the
moscow
daily
news.
because
here
really
is
the
government
determining
how
it
will
facilitate
literature
and
the
mails
are
not
a
faucet
to
be
turned
on
full
speed
if
the
literature
is
approved
by
the
government
and
to
be
reduced
in
pressure
if
the
literature
is
disapproved
by
the
government
even
though
eventually
it
may
sift
through
to
the
individual.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
government
says
that
isn't
very
important
really.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it
says
that
we
have
to
protect
the
sensibilities
of
those
people
who
don't
want
it
and
we
mustn't
subsidize
communist
literature.
i'm
giving
your
honor
the
basic
argument
of
the
government
and
they
attempt
to
assimilate
this
to
the
breard
against
city
of
alexandria
which
involved
of
course
with
your
honor
dissenting
a
commercial
solicitation,
door-to-door
salesmen
and
the
government
attempts
to
assimilate
this
by
a
rather
far
reaching
metaphor
what
it
calls
the
sending
of
the
mail
and
intrusion
into
the
mailbox
as
if
this
were
a
physical
trespass.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
the
government
would
answer
that
it
has
a
right,
(inaudible),
and
so
we
have
the
right
to
do
whatever
we
want
over
there
but
we
also
have
a
right
to
protect
the
mailbox
from
intrusion
here
although
nobody
has
equated
this
with
the
amount
of
junk
mail
that
comes
readily.
now
i
have
a
few
minutes
with
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
suggestion
is
made
in
the
brief.
it
is
not
agreed
to
by
the
administration
before
the
postal
service
committee.
they
say
there
isn't
evidence
of
non-delivery
but
even
if
it
were
true
of
course
we
have
the
right
to
revise
under
39
u.s.c.
505
(a)
the
right
to
revise
our
postal
arrangements
to
other
countries
to
change
the
rates
and
of
course
the
more
fundamental
argument
again,
i
move
away
from
money
is,
are
we
going
to
screen
the
american
people
in
accordance
with
the
views
of
a
customs
house
inspector.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
yes.
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
really
what
i
meant
to
say
that
we
are
governed
here
by
a
constitution.
but
the
chief
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i'm
sure
we
do
but
sometimes
a
statute
is
passed
like
this
almost
a
one
man
job
i
may
say,
giving
full
credit
to
congressman
cunningham
against
all
administration
which
suggests
a
contrary
view
and
a
fear
of
“communist
propaganda”.
this
of
course
rate
the
question
of
what
is
“communist
political
propaganda”?
and
your
honor
we'll
see
the
very
broad
definition
that
appears
on
a
foreign
agents
registration
act
which
maybe
alright
so
far
as
the
government
has
agreed
with
me
before
the
house
committee
--
senate
committee
maybe
alright
so
far
as
requiring
a
man
to
register
because
then
it
doesn't
make
much
difference
what
the
definition
is,
the
propaganda.
but
when
you
are
dealing
here
with
a
restriction
on
freedom
of
the
press,
freedom
of
communication,
then
it
does
make
a
difference
whether
the
definition
is
a
vague
or
a
precise
one
and
the
customs'
officials
themselves
in
congressional
hearings
which
is
to
be
held
after
the
statute,
say
we
need
a
definition
of
what
is
foreign
“communist
propaganda”
because
it
relates
under
the
statute
anything
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
to
anything
whatever
to
do
with
the
policies
and
views
of
a
foreign
country
with
any
attempt
to
promote,
these
are
the
words,
racial,
religious
and
social
tension.
i
think
the
word
or
it's
a
similar
word,
very
broad,
and
you
have
50
customs
officials
and
translators
sitting
on
these
low
11
offices
throughout
the
united
states
reading
all
these
mail,
translating
it
and
trying
to
decide
whether
its
“communist
political
propaganda”.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
it
must
come
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
because
it's
communist,
your
honor.
that
must
come
from
a
group
of
countries
that
we
can
call
the
communist
countries
because
they
are
denied
foreign
assistance,
they
are
denied
the
benefits
of
tariffs.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
east
germany
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
i
don't
think
west
germany.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
perhaps
it's
all
of
germany
that's
being
screened
at
the
moment.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
they
screen
all
material
coming
from
japan
and
mexico
because
they
think
that
communist
literature
might
come
through
those
countries
but
it
wouldn't
be
“communist
political
propaganda”
necessarily
if
it
came
from
japan.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
it's
a
broad
statute
because
we
must
be
very
sure
what
the
american
people
would
be
allowed
to
read.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
because
they
feel
that
canada
maybe
an
entrance
point
for
“communist
propaganda”.
its
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
oh
yes,
oh
yes,
the
whole
eastern
bloc.
would
it
be
satisfactory
mr.
chief
justice
if
i
reserved
whatever
i
have
left
which
is
about
two
minutes
until
the
conclusion
so
i
interrupt
the
solicitor
general
with
this
argument.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
thank
you.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
may
it
please
the
court.
aside
from
two
brief
corrections
of
the
solicitor
general
mainly
at
page
--
in
our
brief
we
cite
a
whole
history
of
divulgence
of
names
to
the
house
committee
of
american
activities,
which
i
think
solicitor
general
will
agree
as
the
fact
answer,
he
looks
at
it.
and
the
fact
that
cards
as
now
used
do
not
appear
to
one
be
subscribed
by
the
addressee
that
his
name
will
not
be
kept
on
the
list
though
it's
the
fact
which
i
indicated
before
would
not
be
conclusive
even
if
they
did
indicate
it
because
the
fear
would
still
be
there.
the
fact
is
that
this
present
statute
discourages
the
picnic
if
i
can
use
that
analogy.
if
the
picnic
is
to
discuss
a
particular
political
philosophy
and
doesn't
discourage
other
picnics,
no
court
would
hold
that
a
state
can
discourage
picnics
on
that
basis.
secondly,
the
fact
that
it
is
a
minor
abridgement
of
speech
as
it
suggested
with
which
we
disagree,
there's
no
reason
under
this
court's
decision
for
not
applying
the
rule
that
there
must
be
a
paramount
interest
for
even
a
minor
abridgment
of
speech.
i
don't
recall
the
cases
but
it's
been
said
very
frequently.
the
definition
of
the
vagueness
of
the
definition
is
indicated
by
the
admissions
in
the
1963
hearing
of
the
postal
authorities
who
have
only
the
statutory
definition
before
them,
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
customs
department
would
simply
incorporate
that
statute
and
they
say,
“we
wish
we
had
a
definition
for
“communist
political
propaganda”.
but
far
more
important
than
any
of
these
details
or
within
the
mechanical
things
of
course
and
so
forth,
although
i
agree
with
everything
that
was
said
by
my
colleague
here
with
respect
to
the
discouragement
which
is
proven
both
by
people
saying
they
don't
want
it
and
by
people
not
answering.
and
i
agree
also
that
there's
a
radical
difference
between
the
injury
to
the
person
who
simply
has
to
send
in
a
notice
saying
he
doesn't
want
“communist
pro
--
political
propaganda”
and
the
man
who
affirmatively
takes
this
position
in
request
to
get
it.
oh,
i
think
this
case
should
be
decided
on
a
broad
philosophic
and
i
do
not
agree
with
my
learned
friend
here
that
policy
and
philosophy
are
not
controlling
in
the
case
involving
the
first
amendment.
and
the
answer
for
me
is
found
in
three
phrases.
the
first
is
mr.
justice
harlan's
statement
in
his
roth
dissent
which
i
take
is
the
view
of
the
court
for
that
--
which
of
course
an
obscenity
case
when
he
said,
“the
federal
government
has
no
business
whether
under
the
postal
or
commerce
power
to
bar
of
the
sale
of
books
because
they
mislead
to
any
kind
of
thoughts.”
and
if
you
change
the
word
bar
to
discourage
i'm
sure
the
principle
is
still
applicable.
and
the
second
is
what
mr.
jackson's
--
justice
jackson
said
concurring
in
thomas
against
collins
when
he
spoke
to
the
fact
that
every
man
must
be
his
own
watchman
for
truth
and
that
the
government
cannot
step
in
to
separate
the
true
from
false.
and
finally
of
course
where
we
always
turn
to
and
what
is
so
applicable
in
this,
alleged
minor
interference
with
a
particular
political
or
economic
or
social
point
of
view
would
the
tacit
encouragement
of
all
other
points
of
view.
although
we
denied
foreign
assistance
to
france
next
year,
the
gaul's
literature
will
also
come
under
the
statute
as
“communist
political
propaganda”
even
though
no
one
regards
him
as
the
communist,
the
statute
would
apply.
and
lamont
would
not
commend
if
it
said
anything
about
our
current
policy.
i
end
with
what
mr.
justice
holmes
said
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
abram's
case,
and
these
are
not
words,
and
this
is
not
just
mere
philosophy.
he
said,
“while
that
experiment,
talking
about
our
democratic
system
in
the
first
amendment,
is
part
of
our
system
and
i
think
that
we
should
be
eternally
vigilant
against
attempts
to
check,
to
check
the
expression
of
opinions
that
we
loathe
and
believe
to
be
fraught
with
death,
it's
hardly
true
of
this
literature
that
way;
unless
they
so
imminently
threaten
immediate
interference
with
the
lawful
and
pressing
purposes
of
the
law
that
an
immediate
check
is
required
to
save
the
country.
no
one
here
suggests
that
the
country's
salvation
depends
upon
the
statute.”
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
if
i
may
conclude
was
stated
so
well
by
senator
johnson,
the
late
senator
johnson,
the
chairman
of
the
committee
which
ultimately
put
through
his
compromised
bill.
when
he
didn't
say
it's
to
save
money
and
he
didn't
say
it's
to
save
sensibility
but
he
said
and
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief,
“is
to
blot
out”.
think
of
those
words
in
the
american
system,
a
blot
out,
the
delivery
of
“communist
political
propaganda”
through
united
states
mails.
and
that
included
in
one
day
under
the
pre-statutory
program,
the
london
economist
and
it
included
a
article
on
chest
for
the
soviet
union
and
who
knows
what
will
come
next.
i
thank
your
honors.
