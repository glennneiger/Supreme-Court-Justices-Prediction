justice
potter
stewart
--
we
have
a
little
difficulty
and
perhaps
this
kind
of
--
because
i'm
--
because
of
daylight
saving
time
or
something
or
maybe
obtuse
this
morning.
justice
potter
stewart
what
the
--
we're
dealing
here
with
the
literature
that
mailed
to
unknowing
and
unwilling
addressees
by
definition
under
the
statute
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
it's
desired,
they
get
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
about
the
protection
of
the
people
who
don't
desire
it.
justice
potter
stewart
would
the
card
--
justice
potter
stewart
would
the
card
contain
a
specific
identification
of
the
material
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
would
it
just
say
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
it
wouldn't
say
the
peking
review.
justice
potter
stewart
or
even
in
the
absence
of
the
statute,
what
you've
just
said
is
correct,
is
it
not?
customs
can
examine
any
unsealed
mail,
first,
for
the
purpose
of
--
the
basic
simple
purpose
of
seeing
whether
it
qualifies
for
the
rate
for
third
or
fourth
class
mail?
secondly,
to
see
whether
or
not
it
contains
any
contraband
or
otherwise
unimportable
matter,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
everything
you've
said
is
true
about
all
mail
coming
from
foreign
countries,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
of
course
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
justice
potter
stewart
the
(inaudible)
of
this
statute
but
so
far
as
the
--
as
their
power
and
even
their
duty
to
look
at
all
mail
coming
from
abroad,
they
have
plenty
of
power
and
in
fact
have
duties
under
other
statutes
not
involved
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
or
any
official
thereof,
it's
the
catchall
at
the
end
there,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
thereof
i
supposed
that
refers
back
to
all
of
these
various
exempt
addressees.
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
completely
missed
the
whole
burden
that
--
which
you
had
to
do
is
say
that
you
do
want
the
mail.
if
you
don't
take
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
trouble
then
you
don't
get
the
mail
because
you
haven't
affirmatively
said
you
do
want
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
you
don't
do
anything,
if
you
don't
do
anything,
what
happens?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
at
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
now,
they
send
out
a
new
card
with
every
piece
of
mail,
under
the
current
system.
justice
potter
stewart
if
he
doesn't
do
anything
about
today's
postcard,
then
next
week
he
may
get
another
postcard
if
some
more
mail
comes
addressed
to
him,
is
that
right
or
am
i
--
if
i've
misunderstood
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
krause,
let
me
see
if
i
understand
that.
this
exhibit
you
have
names
a
particular
--
periodically,
proposal
concerning
the
general
line
of
the
international
communist
movement,
1963
in
what
topic?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
whatever
it
is,
this
--
i'm
just
reading
what
this
card
said.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
if
that
came
to
mr.
heilberg
and
he
did
not
send
the
card
back,
he
would
not
receive
that
periodical,
would
he?
justice
potter
stewart
that
i
don't
understand,
is
that
what
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
solicitor
general
tells
us
that,
it'd
be
nothing
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
great
difficulty
understanding
the
footnote
4
that
you
just
read
to
us,
the
government's
brief
at
the
same
time
that
we're
told
that
no
list
is
kept
of
any
kind.
justice
potter
stewart
can
they
do
this
both?
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
keep
a
record
of
those
who
do
not
desire
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
i
guess
not.
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
the
--
i
just
think
out
loud.
do
you
think
that
there's
a
--
there's
any
right
at
all
not
to
receive
what
you
don't
want
that
the
--
and
that
the
first
amendment
involves
any
right
at
all
not
to
read
what
you
don't
want
to
read?
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
--
do
you
think
you
can
be
force
to
receive
what
you
don't
want?
justice
potter
stewart
than
the
right
not
to
receive.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
think
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
claim
of
a
right
not
to
receive
what
you
don't
want
to
receive,
you
don't
want
to
be
bothered
with,
you
don't
want
it
in
your
waste
baskets,
you
don't
want
any
--
at
any
place
around.
you
haven't
asked
for
it
and
you
don't
want
it.
justice
potter
stewart
what
kind
of
right
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
kind
of
right
is
it?
i
mean
if
it's
a
right
at
all,
what
is
it?
