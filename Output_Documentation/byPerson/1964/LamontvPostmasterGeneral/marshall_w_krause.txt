mr.
marshall
w.
krause
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
appellees,
mr.
heilberg.
in
the
court
below,
our
three
judges
unanimously
held
the
statute
to
be
unconstitutional
and
i
think
if
that
judgment
is
affirmed
here,
it
would
be
the
first
congressional
enactment
to
be
held
unconstitutional
on
the
basis
of
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
i
think
the
thing
for
me
to
do
is
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
that
were
raised
on
the
earlier
argument.
first
of
all,
justice
stewart
asked
about,
“doesn't
this
apply
just
to
something
which
is
not
ordered?”
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
it
applies
to
any
material
determined
to
be
political
propaganda
from
a
communist
nation
so
long
as
it
comes
or
is
prepared
in
a
foreign
country.
the
statute,
section
4008
(a)
says
that
such
detention
shall
not
be
required
which
is
discretionary,
if
it's
furnished
pursuant
to
the
subscription
or
which
is
otherwise
ascertained
by
the
postmaster
general
to
be
desired.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
everything
that
is
determined
to
be
“communist
political
propaganda”
whether
subscribed
to
or
desired
or
not
desired
is
being
screened
under
this
program.
it's
not
just
the
program
that
applies
to
unsolicited
mail.
now,
justice
black
asked
about
reprinted
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
well
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
i
think
that
the
postmaster
and
the
solicitor
general
must
agree
with
me
also
because
they
have
applied
this
program
to
matter
furnished
pursuant
to
subscription
because
they
can't
tell
whether
it's
furnished
pursuant
to
subscription.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
well
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
i
say
--
i
think
one
can
read
that
language
in
two
ways
and
one,
the
congress
telling
the
postmaster
general
not
to
require
it
or
congress
granting
discretion,
"you
don't
have
to
do
it
if
you
don't
want
to".
that's
--
and
that
is
--
it's
the
latter
way
in
which
i
read
the
words
"shall
not
be
required".
i
didn't
think
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
statute
if
the
postmaster
general
decided
we're
going
to
require
these
cards
even
on
subscription
matter.
now,
talking
about
material
which
is
reprinted
from
a
communist
nation,
let's
say
a
speech
of
(inaudible)
reprinted
in
the
united
states,
the
statute
applies
to
all
matter
which
is
printed
or
otherwise
prepared
in
a
nation
which
is
a
nation
as
to
which
trade
restrictions
are
in
effect
namely,
the
communist
nations.
if
a
communist
leader
prepares
a
speech,
to
me,
this
is
otherwise
prepared
in
a
communist
country
and
it
doesn't
matter
where
that
is
printed.
if
it‘s
printed
in
the
united
states,
if
it's
printed
in
el
salvador,
if
it's
printed
in
china,
once
it's
deposited
in
the
international
mail
and
comes
to
this
country,
the
statute
applies.
the
statute
applies
if
it's
subsequently
deposited
in
the
united
states
mail
is
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
justice
brennan,
there
are
absolutely
no
restrictions
as
to
what
countries
customs
chooses
to
screen
their
mail.
they
can
choose
any
country
which
they
believe
in
their
unlimit
--
unlimited
discretion
might
be
sending
material
which
is
otherwise
prepared
or
printed
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
in
a
communist
nation.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes
sir.
its
--
it
--
it's
just
a
matter
of
grace
that
the
customs
bureau
has
chosen
to
include
canada
and
not
include
argentina.
this
is
the
information
we
have
at
this
time
that
argentina
is
not
included.
tomorrow,
the
mail
from
argentina
might
be
decided
that
it
contains
material
prepared
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
it
has
to
be
printed
or
otherwise
prepared
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
in
one
of
those
countries.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
that's
right.
let's
say
--
let's
say
it's
otherwise
prepared
in
china
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
then
mailed
to
argentina
and
then
mailed
from
argentina
to
the
united
states.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
now,
according
to
the
information,
customs
does
not
look
at
mail
from
argentina
but
they
do
look
at
mail
from
canada,
from
taiwan,
from
other
countries
which
they
found
to
contain
that
material
otherwise
prepared.
and
chief
justice
warren,
you
asked
about
england.
england
is
a
country
which
is
covered
by
the
screening
program.
we
have
set
this
out
in
detail
in
our
brief
from
testimony
from
congressional
mater
--
congressional
hearings.
mr.
fishman
who
is
the
deputy
collector
in
new
york
has
said
this,
and
i'm
reading
from
page
3
of
my
--
the
appellee's
brief,
“we
have
examined
a
great
deal
of
material
which
comes
from
england,
some
of
it
published
by
known
communist
front
organizations
or
representatives
thereof.”
now
england
is
not
listed
here
but
they
examined
it
anyway.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
as
far
as
i
know,
they
can
examine
any
mail
which
they
think
might
contain
material
otherwise
prepared
in
a
communist
nation
and
there
are
just
no
limits.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
well,
i
hope
i'm
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
i
hope
i'm
not
being
purist
in
answering
your
question
but
it
--
in
my
opinion
that
is
not
right.
customs
must
examine
mail
for
appropriate
purpose.
the
purpose
as
you've
suggested
are
proper.
and
my
theory
of
our
argument
is
that
the
purpose
that
they
are
examining
mail
under
this
program
is
improper
because
it's
intended
to
restrict
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
that's
right
and
so
we
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
if
they
are
acting
for
a
proper
purpose
that
then
--
if
that
--
with
that
qualification,
i
accept
your
statement.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes
sir,
it
is.
now,
mr.
cox
says
we
wouldn't
do
a
thing
like
that.
i
mean
that's
not
sensible
and
he's
--
but
if
we're
talking
about
the
words
of
this
statute
that's
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
alright.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
first
of
all,
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
first
of
all,
that
first
sentence
of
subsection
(a)
of
section
4008,
otherwise
prepared
in
a
foreign
country.
now,
england
is
a
foreign
country,
the
material
is
prepared
in
that
foreign
country.
you
might
say
that
the
material
is
prepared
in
the
soviet
union
because
that's
where
it
was
written
and
we
usually
think
of
preparation
as
putting
it
in
--
putting
an
idea
into
words.
so
whether
you
say
the
material
is
prepared
in
the
soviet
union
or
in
england,
it's
covered.
and
all
that
happened,
all
that
has
to
happen
is
that
the
customs
bureau
determines
that
it's
“communist
political
propaganda”
because
it
is
issued
by
or
on
behalf
of
any
country
and
i'm
now
reading
from
subsection
(b)
issued
by
or
behalf
--
on
behalf
of
any
country.
now,
when
the
preceding
of
the
soviet
union
issues
its
proceedings,
this
is
material
issued
by
or
on
behalf
of
a
communist
country.
i
think
that
that
language
is
quite
clear,
that's
where
i
get
it.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
only
if
customs
determines
that
bertrand
russell
is
indicating
this
--
issuing
this
material
by
or
on
behalf
of
a
communist
nation.
now,
they
may
or
may
not
determine
that.
i
would
hope
that
they
wouldn't
determine
it
and
i
hope
--
i
would
hope
that
the
speech
would
not
be
so
classified.
but
let
me
say
this
that
there's
absolutely
unreviewable
discretion
on
behalf
of
the
customs
department
to
determine
that
bertrand
russell's
remarks
are
in
fact
prepared
on
behalf
of
the
communist
nation
and
there
is
no
hearing
procedure,
there
is
no
remedy.
it
is
“communist
political
propaganda”
and
the
full
sanctions
of
the
program
applied.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
i
think
it
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
i
think
it
definitely
would,
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
no.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
i
have
to
give
a
qualified
answer
to
that.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
congressmen
and
supreme
court
justices,
etcetera
are
entitled
to
receive
this
material
without
any
card
because
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
section
(c)
of
4008
exempts
any
official
of
the
government
agency.
however,
even
mail
addressed
to
congressmen
and
supreme
court
justices
goes
to
a
special
screening
unit
which
is
set
out
to
look
at
this
mail
and
it's
only
after
the
screening
unit
looks
at
the
mail
and
determines
if
the
addressee
is
exempt
that
its
set
on
--
sent
on.
therefore,
even
as
to
exempt
mail
and
even
as
to
sealed
mail,
you
have
a
delay
while
it
goes
to
the
screening
unit.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
its
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes,
any
official
thereof
is
a
catchall
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
i
wondered
about
that
word
"agency"
myself.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
i
don't
know.
i
would
think
that
the
post
office
would
treat
you
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
as
an
agency.
i
would
imagine
that
they
would.
let
me
point
out
another
--
this
raises
another
point.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
communist
political
propaganda,
i
may.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
oh
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
newspapers
are
not
exempt.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
that's
just
the
exact
point
i
was
going
to
raise
that
newspapers
are
not
exempt.
but
the
general
counsel
of
the
post
office
testified
before
congressional
hearings
that
they
exempt
newspapers,
they
exempt
radio
stations,
they
exempt
televisions
stations
and
they
exempt
magazines
because
they
have
made
a
decision
that
it's
otherwise
desired
by
these
kinds
of
entities.
and
i
think
they've
made
that
decision
very
wisely
because
they
would
have
one
big
squawk
if
they
didn't
make
that.
and
it's
the
same
thing
they
do
as
to
any
plaintiff
who
brings
a
lawsuit.
they've
determined
that
he
otherwise
desires
this
mail.
so
anyone
who
squawks
gets
on
the
exempt
list
so
to
speak.
but
even
if
you're
on
the
exempt
list
i
want
to
emphasize
your
mail
was
sent
to
one
of
the
screening
units
if
it's
from
one
of
the
country's
designated,
one
of
the
28
countries
and
it's
delayed.
now,
justice
douglas
asked
us,
is
the
test,
the
source
of
the
mail
or
is
it
the
content
and
the
answer
you
were
given
as
the
source
of
the
mail,
but
i
think
that's
the
wrong
answer.
the
test
is
the
content.
the
source
does
not
matter
so
long
as
it
is
otherwise
prepared
on
behalf
of
a
nation
which
is
a
--
one
of
these
nations
as
to
which
trade
regulations
are
suspended.
so
the
test
is
the
content
that
the
content
whether
its
“communist
political
propaganda”
that
is
does
it
fall
within
the
foreign
agents
registration
act
definition
which
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
big
statutes
on
our
statute
books.
now,
did
the
lists
go
to
investigators?
there's
no
evidence
that
under
the
present
program
they
did.
there
is
evidence
on
page
19
of
the
yellow
appellee's
brief
that
under
the
past
program
they
did.
for
instance,
the
counsel
for
the
un-american
activities
committee
asks
mr.
fishman,
“you
have
given
the
committee
in
private
session
list
in
great
volume
of
the
recipients
of
this
“communist
political
propaganda”,
have
you
not?”
the
answer
to
that
is
right.
now,
the
section
4008
program
is
a
direct
progeny
of
the
former
program
as
to
which
mr.
fishman
testified
that
great
list
had
been
given
to
the
un-american
activities
committee
that
we
can
determine
by
senator
bush's
comments
when
he
introduced
this
bill.
this
is
senator
bush's
bill.
this
is
not
representative
cunningham's
bill.
representative
cunningham
provided
the
political
pressure
by
attaching
his
bill
as
a
writer
to
the
pay
--
postal
rate
increase
bill.
but
senator
bush
put
his
bill
into
the
senate
and
this
was
the
bill
passed
by
the
senate
and
then
congressman
cunningham
said
he
was
satisfied
with
it
and
he
accepted
it.
now,
here's
what
senator
bush
said
on
introducing
his
bill
which
became
this
statute,
“this
legislation
is
needed
to
counteract
the
unfortunate
effects
of
an
executive
order
issued
on
march
17th,
1961
in
which
the
president
ordered
an
immediate
discontinuation
of
a
program
to
intercept
“communist
political
propaganda”
from
abroad.
the
justification
for
the
executive
or
--
i'm
reading
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
this
is
senator
bush
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
and
this
is
on
appendix
page
13
of
our
yellow
brief.
the
previous
program
as
to
which
senator
bush
referred
which
was
stopped
by
president
kennedy
was
explicitly
to
stop
this
mail
because
of
its
content.
there
was
no
subsidy
raised,
there
was
no
sensibilities
raised,
it
was
merely
on
the
content
of
the
mail
and
this
program
of
course
the
successor
to
that
program.
now
justice
black,
you
raised
an
interesting
point
about
--
is
there
any
historical
precedent?
yes,
there
is
a
historical
precedent.
walter
gellhorn
points
out
in
his
book
individual
freedom
of
government
restraint,
page
88;
that
president
andrew
jackson
instructed
his
postmaster
general
to
have
southern
postmasters
disclosed
to
the
public
those
people
who
received
abolitionist
literature.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
i
don't
know
how
long
it
was
in
effect.
that
information
is
not
given
but
this
is
on
page
88
of
water
gellhorn's
book
and
he
quotes
from
the
correspondence
of
president
jackson.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes
sir.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
that's
discussed
in
the
jackson
case,
ex
parte
jackson.
and
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
individual
freedom
and
governmental
restraints,
walter
gellhorn,
page
88.
and
i
might
suggest
also
there's
a
historical
background
in
eberhard
deutsch's
article
in
1936
michigan
law
review
which
goes
over
calhoon's
objections
to
a
similar
program.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
36
michigan
law
review.
i
don't
have
the
page.
it's
by
mr.
deutsch.
now,
the
statistics
in
which
were
--
were
talked
about
by
justice
goldberg,
i
think
are
really
crucial
because
this
point
that
over
half
of
the
people
who
got
the
cards
wouldn't
return
them.
whether
they
didn't
want
to
return
them,
whether
they
were
afraid
to
return
them,
whether
they've
lost
them,
of
course
we
don't
know.
but
over
half
of
the
cards
were
not
returned
at
all.
i
think
that
this
is
quite
indicative
of
the
way
this
program
operates
because
it
is
the
major
portion
of
these
cards.
people
don't
even
take
the
trouble
to
say
that
they
don't
want
the
mail.
i
think
this
is
indicative
of
its
deterrent
effect.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
pardon
me?
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
if
you
get
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
no,
there
is
--
there
are
blanks
on
the
postcards.
there's
one
of
these
postcards
in
our
record
on
page
10
which
is
--
that
has
four
blanks.
it
says,
“check
here,
this
publication
or
similar
publication”
or
“do
not
deliver
this
publication
or
similar
publication.”
now,
the
majority
of
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
you
don't
do
anything,
first,
the
card
doesn't
tell
you
what's
going
to
happen.
but
the
solicitor
general
has
said
in
footnote
4
of
his
brief,
“if
you
don't
do
anything,
they'll
consider
that
you
don't
want
that
mail
and
you
don't
want
any
other
mail
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
which
isn't
--
which
is
a
result
which
could
not
be
anticipated
by
a
person
who
doesn't
check
that
card.
in
other
words,
the
card
gives
you
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
no,
not
if
a
person
says
that
he
doesn't
want
the
mail
then
they
file
that
desire
--
that
indication.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
there's
just
not
enough
information
to
answer
that
question.
they
may
indicate
--
they
may
file
that
that
with
the
do-not
desire
cards
in
which
case
he
would
never
get
anymore,
or
they
may
just
keep
sending
out
cards.
i
don't
know
what
the
practice
is
now.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
and
the
period
--
the
original
periodical
is
in
esperanto
and
this
is
a
translator's
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
and
he
would
receive
no
other
“communist
political
propaganda”
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
well,
i
don't
understand
it
either
but
that's
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
let's
look
at
footnote
--
let's
look
at
footnote
4
of
this
brief.
i'll
read
the
footnote
because
it's
a
short
one.
the
post
office
department
intends
to
retain
it's
assumption
that
those
who
do
not
return
the
card
want
neither
the
identified
publication
nor
any
similar
one
arriving
subsequently.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
no
sir.
the
card
does
not
say
it.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes,
that's
right.
i
think
that
i
overlooked
that
when
i
spoke.
and
i
have
to
take
back
what
i
said
about
the
addressee
not
really
knowing
that.
i
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
i
don't
know.
and
the
regional
letter
of
the
postmaster
general
is
very
explicit.
page
38
of
the
solicitor's
brief
towards
the
bottom,
the
department
will
not
in
the
future
maintain
any
record
of
the
wishes
of
those
addressees
who
desired
to
receive
“communist
political
propaganda”,
those
--
that's
those
who
desire
to
receive
it.
now,
how
could
they
ever
are
going
to
determine
those
who
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
how
they
are
going
to
determine
those
who
subscribed,
i
have
not
the
slightest
idea
but
i'm
quite
sure
they
couldn't
do
it
unless
they
change
this
regional
letter
because
it's
very
different.
they
can't
keep
any
list
under
the
regional
letter
which
is
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes.
and
i'm
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
they
think
that
a
person
can't
be
hurt
by
not
wanting
literature
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
general
counsel
of
the
post
office
testified
that
there
are
those
people
who
returned
the
cards
even
though
they
don't
want
the
literature
because
they
have
relatives
in
iron
curtain
countries
and
they're
afraid
this
might
get
back
that
they're
not
taking
the
literature
and
this
might
hurt
their
relatives.
and
so
they
have
inconsistent
positions
here.
now,
you
asked,
couldn't
you
raise
the
postal
rates,
let
me
take
a
minute
to
say
how
international
mail
rates
are
determined.
the
country
of
origin
pays
whatever
is
necessary
and
takes
whatever
steps
to
deliver
international
mail
to
the
country
of
receipt,
to
the
border
of
the
country
of
receipt.
they
have
to
pay
for
that
whatever
where
they
do
it.
now,
at
the
border,
at
the
country
of
receipt,
the
mail
is
delivered
free.
this
is
done
under
the
international
postal
convention
on
the
agreement
that
our
mail
from
the
united
states
which
we
send
out
will
also
be
delivered
free
in
whatever
country
it's
sent
to.
but
we
send
out
more
mail
than
we
receive.
therefore,
foreign
governments,
if
there's
any
subsidy
here
are
subsidizing
us.
we
get
more
mail
delivered
for
free
than
they
get
delivered
for
free.
now
on
the
cost
here,
what
we're
worried
about
is,
is
there
any
cost
that
can
be
avoided
by
not
delivering
mail?
it's
possible
to
deliver
--
to
save
some
money
but
it's
certainly
not
a
subsidy
to
any
foreign
government,
let
me
say
this,
the
actual
facts
as
we've
said
in
our
--
set
out
in
our
brief
is
that
about
50,000
pieces
of
mail
are
stopped
from
delivery
each
year
at
a
cost
of
a
half
a
million
dollars
a
year
which
is
$10
for
each
piece
of
mail
not
delivered.
now,
i
don't
think
the
taxpayers
are
getting
a
very
good
deal
on
this,
i
don't
think
it
is
saving
the
taxpayer's
money
not
to
deliver
this
mail.
i
think
that
we
have
to
worry
here
about
direct
infringements
of
first
amendment
rights,
as
well
as
indirect
infringements
of
first
amendment
rights
by
mail
being
sent
to
the
screening
points
which
is
sealed
mail.
and
i
think
it's
very
significant
to
point
out
that
the
representatives
of
the
post
office
said
that
this
mail
comes
all
mixed
up,
all
different
classes.
if
it
comes
from
a
country
that's
on
the
list,
it's
all
sent
to
the
screening
unit,
then
it's
dumped
out,
then
these
--
the
sealed
mail
and
the
exempt
mail
is
sent
on.so
sealed
mail
and
exempt
mail
is
itself
delayed
by
this
program.
it
doesn't
come
with
nice
little
bags,
mr.
abelle
(ph)
testified.
then
everything
is
opened
and
its
read
and
it's
labeled
and
there's
a
process
of
deciding
what
is
and
what
isn't
“communist
political
propaganda”
which
may
delay
it
as
the
solicitor
general
says
for
two
weeks,
then
a
determination
of
the
desire
is
made
or
all
these
postcards
go
back
and
forth.
all
that
i
think
is
a
direct
infringement
on
first
amendment
rights
and
i
think
that
the
delay
of
sealed
and
exempt
mail
was
an
indirect
infringement
on
first
amendment
rights
and
the
government
has
shown
no
compelling
interest
for
that
infringement.
the
right
to
receive
is
of
course
protected
and
i
think
there's
a
license
to
receive
mail
required
by
this
statute,
same
way
that
there's
a
license
to
give
a
speech
required
by
thomas
versus
collins.
you
don't
send
in
your
little
registration
form,
you
don't
get
your
mail.
that
is
a
license.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
i
don't
think
you
could
be
forced
to
read
but
to
receive
it
is
a
different
question.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
no
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
you
--
you
have
the
right
to
--
you
have
the
burden
though
to
indicate
that
you
don't
want
to
receive
it,
just
as
this
court
held
in
martin
versus
struthers
that
anyone
who
didn't
want
someone
ringing
their
doorbell
could
put
a
no
trespassing
sign
and
most
likely
this
would
be
honored.
and
if
it
wasn't
there
could
be
perhaps
some
criminal
statute
to
punish
it.
i
think
that
the
right
to
receive
is
so
much
superior
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
right
not
to
receive
that
it
can't
be
in
the
same
class.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
i
think
that's
a
valuable
right.
i'm
not
sure
it's
a
constitutional
right.
i
wouldn't
put
it
on
a
constitutional
level
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
--
unless
you
were
so
annoyed
--
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
it's
a
right
that
deserves
our
sympathy.
we
don't
want
to
be
bombarded
by
things
that
we
don't
want
but
i
think
the
government
is
not
required
to
prevent
it
as
they
are
required
to
prevent
first
amendment
infringements.
and
i
think
that
the
government
has
adequate
steps
to
prevent
it
now
in
the
regulations
we
cite
in
our
brief.
they
can
notify
the
postmaster
general
and
they
won't
get
any
of
this
mail.
and
there's
no
harmful
consequences
from
such
a
notification.
lastly,
i
would
just
like
to
say
that
there
is
a
real
damage
here
from
mistakes
in
classification.
it's
very
easy
for
such
mistakes
to
be
made
under
the
definition
given
on
the
foreign
agents
registration
act,
you
have
delay
and
that
is
a
damage.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
marshall
w.
krause
yes,
i'm
glad
you
mentioned
that.
my
client
is
an
applicant
for
american
citizenship.
he
hasn't
applied
yet,
he's
not
eligible
to
apply.
he
hasn't
lived
here
long
enough.
but
he's
in
an
especially
sensitive
position,
he
testified
to
that
effect
that
he
was
concerned
that
if
the
naturalization
service
found
that
he
received
“communist
political
propaganda”,
they
might
use
this
to
make
further
investigations
to
use
it
against
him.
and
we've
cited
a
case
in
our
brief,
the
gunovich
case
where
american
citizenship
was
denied
to
a
man
for
one
reason
only,
that
is
that
he
read
a
yugoslav
communist
publication.
this
was
denied
by
the
trial
court
and
by
three
judges
on
appeal
and
the
supreme
court
of
california
reversed
and
said,
“you
can't
deny
just
on
this
one
thing
that
he
read
a
publication.”
but
the
fear
is
well-founded
that
this
would
be
used
against
him.
thank
you.
