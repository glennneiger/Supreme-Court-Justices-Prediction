is
this
statute,
only
relate
to
foreign
mail
or
does
it
relate
also
to
domestic
mail
which
is
the
subject
of
which
has
foreign
(inaudible)?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
so
in
other
words
if
you
order
something
through
the
bookstore,
a
magazine
or
a
book
that
had
it's
origin
abroad,
that
mail
can
also
be
screened
under
the
statute?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
wouldn't
the
government
also
argues,
doesn't
it,
that
the
communist
countries
will
not
reciprocally
compare
the
american
publications
from
the
access
to
there
service.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
thought
there
was
a
more
fundamental
argument
against
the
government.
i
hadn't
understood
that
the
american
constitution
is
popular
over
in
communist
countries.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
your
arguments.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
general,
so
you
admit
that
the
national
security
felt
that

who
makes

who
makes
the

who
makes
the
determination
in
these
11
key
points
as
to
whether
the
literature
is
“communist
political
propaganda”?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
solicitor
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
general,
would
you
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
not
going
now?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
we
are
talking
aobut
the
stacks
of
mail
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
that
is
one
way.
now
here
of
course,
throughout,
in
terms
about
the
recipients
stopping
them,
there
are
several
other
things
to
be
noted.
in
the
first
place,
most
of
the
recipients
don't
know
at
least
in
the
case
of
the
first
few
letters
that
this
is
coming.
it's
unsolicited
to
begin
with.
why
should
they
take
the
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
general,
the
post
office
i
believe
under
the
present
law
to
take
care
of
the
second
matter
by
increasing
the
rate
for
--
would
be
self-sustaining,
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
they
have
to
pay
some
postage
in
order
to
get
this
into
the
mail
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
but
isn't
this
done
by
bilateral
postal
convention
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
in
which
we
get
some
revenues,
as
of
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
isn't
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
because
i
--
i
maybe
ignorant
about
this
but
i
thought
that
these
rates
are
determined
by
negotiation
in
which
you
offset
proceeds
versus
expenditures
that
is
what
i
think,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
no,
i
thought
it
was
something
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
maybe
wrong
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
it
may
be
possible.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
would
you
comment
in
reference
to
the
question
of
justice
brennan
asked
you
about
who
the
burden
was
and
the
interest?
would
you
comment
on
the
statistics
on
page
6
of
the
yellow
grid,
appellee's
brief
which
apparently
were
furnished
by
the
post
office
in
which
are
the
actual
experience
under
this
statute?
that's
the
yellow
appellee's
brief.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
which
were
true
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
which
would
show
--
and
i
have
in
here,
it
shows
that
out
of
35,000
notices
sent
out,
15,000
were
not
returned,
4500
were
undeliverable,
8900
were
returned
asking
that
no
such
mail
be
delivered,
6721
were
returned
asking
that
all
such
mail
be
delivered
and
3900
were
returned
asking
that
particular
publication
be
delivered.
now,
this
would
seem
the
basis
of
the
returns
here
that
more
people
--
putting
aside
those
who
made
no
return,
it's
the
post
office
i
take
it
retreats
because
they
don't
want
it.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
would
assume.
but
among
those
who
return
in
this
ballot
we
have
here;
among
those
who
returned
there
would
be
more
people
wanting
to
keep
it
even
though
it
was
unsolicited
presumably,
than
people
who
asked
that
it
be
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
said
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well
--
the
solicitor
general
has
said
that
they
realized
that
that
is
a
problem
and
they
are
trying
to
accommodate
this
problem
with
not
keeping
a
list
which
i
can
understand
is
a
very
difficult
problem
to
work
out.
but
i
think
the
statute,
but
you
were
talking
about
the
statute
putting
aside
for
--
they're
doing
it.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
it
would
seem
to
me
that
statute
is
a
mandatory
statute
and
it
says
that
except
that
such
attempt
shall
not
be
required
in
the
subscription.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
would
you
think
so?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
that
(inaudible)?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
what
would
you
get
(inaudible)?
justice
arthur
j.

do
you
think
one
(inaudible)

the

(inaudible)
justice
arthur

(inaudible),
a

that
is
a
part
of
that

if

require

do

arthur

goldberg
no,
no.
the

i
think
we
have
to
be
clear.
i
don't
think
there's
an
inconsistency
except
the

justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
the
problem
of
the
subscription
if
the
solicitor
general

justice
arthur

said
there
were
such.
would
you

they
will
not
want

in
having
this

i
don't
want

saying

because
they
want
it.
