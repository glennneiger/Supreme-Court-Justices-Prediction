--
of
this,
i'm
not
sure
but
i'm
reading
a
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
sure
about
reading
the
statute
as
to
this
point
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
supposed
the
propaganda
should
be
mailed
in
or
sent
in
to
this
country,
some
printer
here
decided
to
sell
it
and
make
a
profit
and
he
reprints
it
here,
is
that
barred?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
barred?
justice
hugo
l.
black
supposed
he
changes
some
of
the
words
in
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
--
thinks
he
can
improve
it
a
little
and
he
paraphrase
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
it's
not
based
on
the
--
i
supposed
then
the
government
claim
of
constitutionality
is
not
based
on
the
--
its
power
to
keep
things
from
coming
into
the
country.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
to
keep
things
from
getting
to
the
individual
of
a
particular
type.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
say
the
government,
who
do
you
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
--
who
was
the
witness?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
basic
argument
made
as
to
the
importance
of
this
to
the
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
is
the
basic
reason
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
don't
suppose
we
intrude
into
anything
when
we
send
radio
messages
over
to
the
bureau,
what
they
call
the,
behind
the
iron
curtain?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
we
have
a
right
to
be
less
fear
by
foreign
propagandas
than
they
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
say,
that
was
all
authored
by?
justice
hugo

black
thank
you.

justice

black
how
will
the
man
know
whether
he's
on
the
list
that
the
postmaster
general
thinks
he
ought
to
look
at
this
mail?
justice
hugo

i
am
talking
about

i'm
talking
abut
this
mail.
justice

black
(voice

justice

mail
that's
sent
to
him
like
i
get
all
the
time
that
i
never
ask
for,
some
of
it
are
never
wanted.
but
he
gets
everyday,
how
would
i
know
whether
they
were
letting
me
--
had
my
name
on
so
that
i
couldn't
get
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
going
to
tell
us
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
an
indication
of
how
long
it
took
them
--
and
how
many
people
it
took,
and
how
long
it
took
to
do
that
screening?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
we
have
any
--
i
haven't
read
the
briefs,
but
any
precedents,
if
you
think
cover
this
type
of
legislation
in
the
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
there
any?
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
laws
in
connection
with
the
abolition
of
literature
going
into
the
south
that
you
remember?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
well,
i
was
curious
whether
we
did
have
anything
like
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
--
nothing
on
obscene
literature
that
you
know
of.
this
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
objective
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
send
it
in
an
envelope?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
government
ever
send
it
in
an
envelope?
justice
hugo
l.
black
open
postcard?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
as
i
understand
it,
the
literature
is
not
based
on
the
fact
that
its
published
on
the
envelope,
is
it,
that's
a
political
propaganda?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
some
--
that
there'd
be
quite
a
difference
between
living
in
a
village
of
400
and
getting
it
into
a
city
of
a
million.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
a
difference
between
those
two
instances,
that
in
the
one
instance,
the
man
decides
for
him
said,
"you
take
this
or
leave
it?"
but
he
goes
and
sends
it.
in
the
other
instance,
the
government
steps
in
as
a
(inaudible)
and
arranges
it
so
rather
than
difficult
for
him
to
say,
"i
want
it."
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you've
argued
it
on
the
basis
and
i
think
it's
a
very
excellent
argument
in
those
facts,
if
i
may
say,
that
all
that's
involved
here
really
and
always
to
considers
a
and
b
called
subsidy
and
the
other
sensibility,
can
we
be
blind
enough
to
think
that
the
real
obvious
and
purposes
is
not
to
keep
out
argument
in
favor
of
communist
party
or
communist
government,
isn't
that?
do
you
think
there's
a
--
slightest
possibility
was
then
passed
but
for
that
dominant
motive?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

don't
you
think
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
don't
you
that's
what
it
passed
to
prevent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
that
the
cunningham
didn't
pass
--
get
it
passed
over
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
just
filed
it,
didn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
vote
against
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
then
vote
against
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
the
congressman
permitted
to
receive
any
of
this
or
without
having
it
inspected,
are
they
also
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
protected
on
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
propaganda?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
section?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
a
--
i
gather
this,
did
you
mean
a
congressman
may
get
it
because
congress
is
a
united
states
government
agency,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
it?
is
the
congressman
an
agency?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
have
any
other
in
your
brief,
didn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
in
effect
for
some
time,
was
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
not
an
investigation
made
by
the
committee
which
became
a
senate
document?
