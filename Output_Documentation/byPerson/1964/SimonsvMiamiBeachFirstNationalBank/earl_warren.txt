mr.
ward.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
your
case
depend
on
this
finding
with
you
on
that
point?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
that.
what
i
was
--
what
i
was
wondering
is,
does
your
case
depend
on
the
answer
you
just
gave
to
justice
white
namely
that
this
was
--
was
not
a
proper
divorce?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
answer
that
after
--
after
recess.
mr.
ward,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sibley.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
divorce
court
in
these
circumstances
have
the
power
to
make
the
decree
concerning
the
property
of
the
parties?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
did
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
wouldn't
the
court
--
the
divorce
court
find
that
there
were
no
property
rights
to
be
determined?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
was
that
--
would
that
in
anyway
affect
the
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sibley
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
dower
rights
are
property
rights,
would
the
fact
that
the
decree
in
divorce
case
said
that
there
are
no
property
rights
to
be
determined
in
this
case
and
none
were
determined
have
any
significance
at
all
in
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
--
i
understand
that
but
also
i
suppose
in
--
or
i'll
ask
you
the
question
i
don't
know.
suppose
the
new
york
court
after
this
divorce
had
increased
--
attempted
to
increase
the
separate
maintenance
against
the
husband,
could
they
have
done
it
so
lately?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
something
of
an
inchoate
right
too?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ward.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we're
talking
on
the
new
york
case.
