in

now,

now,
the
(inaudible)

assuming

ground,

and
assert
your
--
justice

(inaudible)
with
the

having

lost
it,
and
suddenly
here
you
got
ruled.
in

this
court
or
florida
court
was
acting
upon
the
divorce
suit.
justice
arthur
j.

you'd
have
jurisdiction
with
the

with
the

(inaudible)

possibly.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
man
of
residence.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
your
argument
in
this
court
is
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
was
on
the
constitution
here,
divorce
attacked
upon
their
judgment
of
any
kind,
you
know
the
court
has
jurisdiction
(inaudible)
in
the
statute
and
the
facts
of
it
has
been
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that's
an
assumption.
many
divorce
is
granted
by
a
court
residence
jurisdiction
and
it
has
certain
property
principles
under
florida
law.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
assuming
florida
law
is
that
(inaudible)that
if
you
get
a
divorce,
the
property
is
cut
off
the
way
it's
done.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
don't
you
have
any
explicit
adjudication
in
florida?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
if
the
husband
was
domiciliary
of
florida,
why
doesn't
she
have
to
go
into
the
proceeding?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
warden
let
me
ask
you.
take
this
hypothetical.
suppose
that
i
am
sued
for
a
thousand
dollars
on
a
loan,
i
denied
that
i
owed
the
money.
the
court
decided
to
do
it
in
my
favor,
the
court
in
new
york,
it
says
in
the
new
york
court.
new
york
court
says
that
i
don't
owe
the
money.
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
is
in
nevada,
goes
to
nevada.
i
happen
to
be
on
vacation.
he
summons
his
hand
and
then
he
sued
me
again
for
the
thousand
dollars.
can
i
tell
that
to
summons'
up?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
or
must
i
not
appear
in
that
action
then
and
plead
res
judicata?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
that's
the
distinction.
but
once
you
concede
that
the
husband
acquired
a
domicile
and
that
the
florida
court
has
jurisdiction
in
a
divorce
action
where
a
party
has
domicile
over
the
action,
if
it
has
jurisdiction
over
the
status
of
the
marriage,
then
the
substitute
service
is
permissible.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
she
also
did
advise
not
hear
what
he
said
and
she
admit
that
the
husband
have
to
ignore
her
and
he
told
her
it
was
appearing.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
he
didn't
believe
it?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
did
not
however
--
full
faith
and
credit
was
not
given
to
(inaudible)
indication
of
the
new
york
court
and
out
of
that,
the
wife
has
justified
living
separate
and
apart
from
each
other
because
the
(inaudible)
which
is
the
same
type
of
conduct
in
which
the
new
york
court
held
that
the
wife
is
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
did
not
(inaudible)
affirm
it
on
the
ground
that
(inaudible)
record.
by
choosing
not
to
appear
in
the
florida
divorce
suit,
the
nonresident
wife
was
precluded
of
filing
suit
years
later
set
aside
the
decree
for
matters
which
could
have
been
litigated
by
her
in
the
defense
of
the
lawsuit.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
--
that
was
the
basis,
wasn't
it?
