justice
potter
stewart
my
--
my
problem
is
this
mr.
ward,
and
again,
i
--
i
leave
it
to
you
that
to
answer
in
the
course
of
your
argument
if
you
cannot
right
now
but
even
if
the
wife
had
done
that,
then
the
florida
court
would
have
said,
“alright
yes,
you
know
you've
told
us
about
this
separate
--
the
separate
maintenance
decree,
and
we
recognized
it
and
we
ordered
the
husband
to
keep
paying
you.”
well,
in
fact
that's
what
did
happened.
he
did
pay
all
his
lifetime
until
his
death.
and
so,
what
--
what
would
have
been
gained?
what
more
--
what
more
could
have
been
gained?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
understand
that
that
was
what
that
decree
provided.
it
provided
separate
--
a
legal
separation
and
separate
maintenance
alimony.
it
didn't
--
it
didn't
say
you
have
to
remain
married
to
each
other
the
rest
of
your
lives.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
new
york,
this
could
--
this
could
have
been
followed
by
an
absolute
divorce,
could
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
was
nothing
in
that
decree
that
said,
“neither
one
of
you
can
ever
bring
suit
for
divorce?”
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
nothing
in
there
saying,
“you
have
to
stay
married
to
each
other
until
the
first
one
of
you
dies?”
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
--
so
since
there
wasn't,
then
that
could
have
been
followed
as
it
was
followed
by
a
divorce.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
estin
against
estin
says
that,
if
i
understand
it,
that
florida
couldn't
have
cut
off
the
separate
maintenance
payments
and
that
florida
could
in
fact
was
silent,
the
florida
court
didn't
know
about
that
new
york.
but
in
fact
those
separate
maintenance
payments
were
made
throughout
the
life
of
the
husband.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
would
satisfy
the
estin
case
in
the
other
two
vanderbilt
and
the
other
one.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
--
and
the
florida
court
granted
a
--
an
absolute
divorce,
that
settled
the
question
of
dower
because
only
a
will
gets
dowers,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
that
wasn't
--
that
question
wasn't
before
the
new
york
court.
justice
potter
stewart
dower
--
the
question
of
dower
only
arises
after
the
husband
dies.
the
--
that
he
has
to
be
somebody's
husband
for
--
for
because
it's
only
the
wife
who
gets
dower,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
understand
that
the
--
that's
what
because
of
a
continuing
trouble,
if
the
new
york
court
had
decided
that
she
had
a
permanent
right
to
remain
his
wife.
justice
potter
stewart
that
court
decided
was
that
she
had
a
right
to
be
separated
from
him
and
to
get
payments
from
him.
justice
potter
stewart
not
that
she
had
a
right
to
remain
his
wife.
it
might
be
a
different
case
if
he
had
brought
a
divorce
and
she
had
defended
successfully
then
the
court
would
have
decided
the
husband
has
no
right
to
a
divorce
and
as
of
now,
you,
as
his
wife,
have
a
right
to
be
married
to
him.
but
that
wasn't
that
kind
of
a
decree.
justice
potter
stewart
they
could
have
--
they
could
have
in
the
decree
of
taking
the
property
of
the
husband
who
was
before
this
plaintiff.
justice
potter
stewart
could
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
could
it
not,
as
a
matter
of
power?
