justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
did
it
insofar
that
it
affected
her
property
rights.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
claiming
that
they
have
a
right
to
sever
the
relationship
of
husband
and
wife
per
se.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
other
statement
is
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
any
property
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
they
--
whether
they
would
have
to
give
it
to
the
separation
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
let
yourself
get
into
that
situation,
sufficiently
his
wife
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
she
had
to
be
sufficiently
his
wife
and
does
she
--
might
she
have
the
right
because
of
the
law
whether
she's
his
wife
or
not
his
wife.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
--
would
you
mind
telling
me
in
very
short
framing,
just
precisely
what
that
decree
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
point
of
it
are
you
relying?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
difference
would
that
make
on
your
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
attacking
a
divorce
on
that,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
--
your
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
claim
is
based
fully
on
dower.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
district
glad
that
you
would
be
entitled
to
dower
rights,
the
new
york
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
they
remain
husband
and
wife
at
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
treating
this
just
exactly
as
though
it
was
a
judgment
made
the
new
york
court,
the
litigation
between
the
husband
and
wife.
but
she
claimed
that
he
owed
her
a
certain
amount
of
money
as
i
gather
and
to
get
a
definite
judgment
for
certain
amount
of
money
for
certain
length
of
time,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
that's
true
that
would
bar
a
divorce
somewhere,
couldn't
it
or
would
it?
and
you're
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
vanderbilt
case,
you
said
that
it
took
the
action
it
did
based
on
their
opinion
in
which
you
are
referring
now
in
armstrong,
didn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
vanderbilt
said
the
reasons
given
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
vanderbilt
where
you
hold
it,
i
mean
in
armstrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
did
he
live
--
when
did
the
two
live
when
they
--
the
decree
was
rendered
in
new
york?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
been
both
present.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
wife
was
adjudicated
there
and
she
remained
living
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
that
despite
that
fact
and
despite
the
fact
that
they
had
given
her
an
interest,
he
had
to
pay
it
so
much
in
property
in
recognizing
that
florida
dower
laws
would
govern
rather
than
new
york
dower.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
new
york
had
--
i'm
asking
you
this
state
because
it's
the
most
interesting
question.
suppose
new
york
had
a
law
the
time
that
they
both
lived
there
and
saying
that
people
who
lived
here
would
be
governed
by
the
state's
law
on
dower
and
everything
else
as
far
as
they
adjudicate
it
and
the
judgments
were
entered.
we
will
hold
to
every
wife
here
is
entitled
to
dower,
what
we
call
a
dower
when
a
husband
is
dead,
wherever
he
lived,
would
that
been
an
invalid
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course,
they
hadn't
named
that
dower
but
said
that
--
that
if
this
state's
interest
in
the
marriage
life,
people
and
their
status
husband
and
wife,
the
--
the
right
to
see
that
the
wife
is
taken
care,
whatever
her
husband
does
and
wherever
he
goes,
the
law
of
this
state
is
that
she
can
continue
to
draw
from
him
--
make
him
pay
her
money
after
he
leaves
the
state
to
support
her,
it
was
wrong.
would
that
be
a
bad
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
we
say
first,
no
decree.
it
just
said
it
in
the
statute.
it
said
that
in
the
state
the
state
has
an
interest
in
the
marriage
of
people.
it
has
an
interest
that
seeing
that
the
wife
has
not
left
him
pecunious
on
the
public
and
our
law
therefore
recognizes
that
she's
entitled
to
have
her
husband
support
her
whether
he
lives
here
or
lives
somewhere
else.
would
you
say
that
was
invalid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
was
valid
in
new
york,
it
could
be
valid
in
florida,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
did
say
that
florida
could
extend
this
law
beyond
the
boundaries
of
florida,
people
who
is
domiciliary
in
a
case
some
years
ago.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
versus
florida.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
based
on
the
fact
that
they
live
in
florida,
domicile
was
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
suppose
there
was
--
they
are
here,
this
was
--
how
much
was
he
to
pay
her
per
month?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
couldn't
escape
that,
could
he,
by
going
to
florida
to
live?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
suppose
this
decree
was
offensive.
i'm
not
saying
it
is.
suppose
this
decree
we
have
it
now
that
to
be
enforced
after
the
time
of
his
death,
as
i
understand
it,
even
though
he
went
to
florida
and
new
york
set
a
decree.
suppose
by
far
that
was
state
of
new
york,
the
decree
could
be
read
as
say,
she
has
an
interest
in
the
property
which
will
continue
so
long
as
she
lives
in
new
york
and
needs
the
support,
would
that
be
invalid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
suppose
the
decree
said
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
that's
a
valid
decree?
i'm
not
saying
it
is.
if
it
said
that,
why
wouldn't
it
be
governed
by
the
principles
of
the
estin
case?
and
why
wouldn't
new
york
will
inquire
to
be
compelled
to
give
it
full
faith
and
credit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
had
to
be
valid
rights
though
under
the
state
whether
the
decree
was
rendered.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
one
there
was
no
decree
and
one
there
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
it's
just
the
outset,
they
didn't
make
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
may
think
--
i
may
say
to
you
that
i
think
it's
a
wholly
improper
designation
to
put
on
it
by
people
who
didn't
like
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
this
confuses
me
for
it
to
be
used.
