mr.
marion
e.
sibley
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
justices
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
i
have
with
me,
my
partner,
mr.
irwin
levenson
of
the
florida
bar.
this
case
is
one
that
has
puzzled
me,
since
he
has
--
since
the
certiorari
was
granted
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
i
have
had
difficulty
in
understanding
what
the
problem
was
and
how
to
face
it.
it
has
now
been
conceded
as
it
must
be
that
if
the
state
of
florida
had
jurisdiction
of
a
divorce
proceeding
because
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
was
domiciled
in
florida
and
florida
had
jurisdiction
of
the
status
of
marriage
in
that
proceeding.
it
has
been
admitted
that
the
petitioner
here
received
procedural
due
process.
she
received
the
summons
in
new
york
or
the
notice
in
new
york.
she
received
the
complaint
in
the
courts
of
new
york
as
provided
strictly
by
the
statutes
for
substituted
service
in
florida.
she
took
those
to
her
attorney
in
new
york,
in
fact
there
were
two
attorneys,
and
was
advised
not
to
contest
the
divorce
proceedings
because
new
york
did
not
recognize.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
substituted
service,
bad
publication
but
the
complaint
was
forwarded
to
those
required
by
our
statute.
and
a
notice
to
appear
was
forwarded
which
she
admits
she
received
and
which
she
took
her
attorney
in
new
york
who
advised
her
not
to
appear
in
the
florida
proceedings.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
that
is
true.
but
it
must
be
recognized
that
on
the
evidence
and
the
overpowering
evidence,
the
lower
court
decided
that
was
untrue.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
he
didn't
believe
and
i
think
he
would
justify
it
in
so
doing
and
that
i
believe
is
a
fact
that
he
must
assume
exist
in
this
case.
now,
that
was
not
unusual
advice
for
the
new
york
attorney
to
give,
i
don't
think
because
i
have
given
the
same
advice
to
my
clients.
if
i
had
a
fairly
good
--
an
award
of
alimony
in
the
separate
maintenance
proceeding,
and
the
husband
takes
himself
to
nevada
as
has
--
it
happened
in
my
practice.
i
have
often
advised
under
the
estin
case
or
under
the
armstrong
case,
and
under
the
vanderbilt
case
not
to
appear
in
the
nevada
proceedings
in
order
that
the
wife
might
continue
in
florida
to
receive
the
benefit
of
the
decree
she
has
there
obtained
for
money.
i
have
never
been
so
bold
as
to
suggest
that
the
divorce
in
nevada
was
not
good
or
she
would
have
some
residual
rights
to
dower
notwithstanding
in
fact
that
the
divorce
was
good
and
she
was
not
the
widow
of
the
man
upon
his
death.
having
conceded
the
authority
and
power
and
the
jurisdictional
power
where
the
florida
court
over
the
status
of
the
parties,
the
divorce
in
florida
of
course
is
binding
upon
the
parties
insofar
as
the
dissolution
of
the
status
is
concerned.
now,
we
must
concede
that
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
divorce
in
florida,
the
lady
had
filed
a
suit
for
separate
maintenance
in
new
york
and
had
been
successful
in
procuring
an
award
of
$440
a
month
and
i
think
that
was
a
final
award
made.
it
must
be
conceded
that
that
judgment
was
honored
throughout
the
life
of
the
dissident.
so
full
faith
and
credit
was
extended
to
that
judgment
in
that
every
quarter
was
paid
under
and
it's
conceded
by
counsel
and
that
is
true.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
in
all
candor,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
would
have
to
concede
on
that
very
parts
--
small
segment
of
the
record
in
new
york
that
that
grounds
were
closely
alive.
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
say
and
i
think
it's
impossible
for
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
--
of
the
united
states
to
say
that
it
was
res
judicata
because
we
do
not
have
the
pleadings
nor
the
issues,
nor
the
testimony,
we
have
only
a
segment
of
a
judge's
order
and
then
we
cannot
tell
whether
that
actually
follows
the
pleadings
and
what
the
actual
issue
was.
but
i
would
say
from
what
that
judge
said
in
that
very
small
segment
of
the
record,
there's
an
indication
with
the
grounds
were
closely
alike
if
not
the
same.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
not
in
the
slightest,
your
honor
pleases,
not
in
the
slightest.
when
the
florida
court
had
jurisdiction
of
the
cause
and
gave
her
notice,
procedural
due
process
and
she
determined,
as
i
have
pointed
out
before,
that
in
order
to
save
her
judgment
in
new
york,
she
would
not
go
to
florida
and
present
her
defenses
if
she
had
any
including
the
defense
of
res
judicata.
while
then,
she
waved
her
right
10
years
later
after
her
husband
was
dead
to
come
back
into
florida
and
say,
“oh,
i
had
a
defense
to
that
lawsuit
but
i
have
followed
the
counsel's
advice
at
that
time
and
didn't
make
my
defense.
pardon
me,
let
him
make
it
now.”
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well,
in
the
williams
case,
if
your
honor
pleases,
the
right
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
the
right
to
reexamine
the
question
of
residence
was
preserved
to
another
court.
that
of
course
was
preserved
to
the
florida
court
as
well
and
a
reexamination
of
that
issue
was
made
in
this
case
and
overwhelmingly
established
by
the
record
that
he
was
a
resident
at
the
time
that
he
filed
this
divorce
proceeding
and
remained
a
resident
for
nine-and-a-half
years
later
and
died
a
resident
of
florida.
so
it
might
make
a
difference,
it
might
not
make
a
difference.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
it
is
conceivable
that
she
might.
it
is
conceivable
that
she
might
not.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
i
don't
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
if
she
had
unsatisfied,
she'd
remained
his
wife
and
he
would
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
and
we
wouldn't
have
been
here
today.
i'm
quite
satisfied
about
that.
now,
having
conceded
jurisdiction
of
the
court
in
the
first
instance,
having
conceded
the
divorce
to
be
good,
and
having
conceded
the
status
to
have
been
affectionately
dissolved
by
the
decree
in
florida,
what
now
do
we
have
left?
we
have
the
simple
question.
does
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
find
a
federal
question
in
the
courts
of
florida,
sustaining
the
divorce
decree
which
it
has
jurisdiction
to
do
and
holding
in
florida
that
that
decree
eliminates
dower
in
florida,
not
in
new
york?
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes
sir.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
what
did
the
appellate
court
do
with
it?
well
all
i
could
say
is
they
affirmed
it
in
toto.
they
affirmed
it
in
the
lower
court's
judgment
in
toto
and
it
was
amply
supported
by
the
evidence
of
the
case.
and
that's
all
i
could
say
about
it
that
they
affirmed
it.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well,
that
was
--
that
was
part
of
the
basis
i
think
but
i
think
that
basis
is
perfectly
sound.
i
think
having
afforded
her
a
right
to
contest
jurisdiction.
now,
this
is
not
--
this
is
not
a
question
of
--
of
a
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
because
the
circuit
court
of
dade
county
has
planted
a
jurisdictional
divorce
actions.
and
that
was
the
subject
matter
to
suit.
but
she
had
a
right
to
come
in
and
say
at
this
moment,
“you
have
not
qualified
for
divorce,”
and
urge
that
ground
that
it
would
have
been
dismissed
if
he
was
found
that
he
had
not
added
--
he's
not
added
his
residence
and
he
might
have
recommit
it
after
he
had
--
had
procured
his
mandate,
they
bona
fide
residence.
but
that
is
not
--
that
is
--
that
does
not
go
to
a
subject
matter
of
the
case
because
the
court
had
jurisdiction
of
the
divorce
proceeding.
that
goes
to
the
defense
that
she
may
have
urged
which
she
elected
not
to
urge
and
if
she
had
urge
it,
she
would
lost
it
as
clearly
demonstrated
by
this
record.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well,
yes
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
it
could
have
happened,
of
course,
it
didn't
happen.
and
the
defense
wasn't
raised
and
if
the
--
or
fine
cattle
or
fish,
to
let
a
lady
refuse
to
come
in
and
defend
the
divorce
proceeding
and
where
her
husband
died
40
years
later
and
said,
“well,
i
had
a
good
defense
at
the
time
so
give
me
dower,
give
me
dower.”
well
that's
about
where
we
are
at
in
this
case.
but
coming
back,
we
have
a
divorce
decree
of
florida
conceded
by
counsel
and
necessarily
so
to
be
a
good
divorce
decree.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
did
the
florida
court?
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
on
substituted
of
the
lady
in
the
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
it
did
not
so.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
it
did
not.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well,
as
a
matter
of
power,
your
honor
said
in
armstrong
versus
armstrong
at
least
there
was
a
shop
division
on
which
you
said
but
in
armstrong
versus
armstrong
as
i
read
it,
your
honors
said
that
when
florida
decided
mr.
armstrong,
didn't
owe
his
wife
an
alimony
and
she
had
no
property
rights
in
his
property.
now,
when
mrs.
armstrong
caught
mr.
armstrong
in
ohio,
your
honors
said
that
that
decree
could
not
be
enforceable
as
far
as
property
rights
were
concerned
in
ohio
under
the
vanderbilt
case
and
under
the
estin
case.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes.
i
believe
the
first
one
was
estin
versus
estin,
the
second
armstrong,
the
third
was
vanderbilt.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
in
which
--
in
which
it
was
said
that
property
rights
on
substituted
service
could
not
be
affected
by
a
divorce
proceeding
by
the
husband.
you're
referring
primarily
--
when
i
say
property
rights,
you're
referring
primarily
to
the
right
to
alimony.
and
you
refer
to
this
as
an
intangible
right.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
i
believe
it
did,
your
honor,
i
have
taken
into
preempt.
my
recollection
is
that
it
did.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
none,
whatever,
if
you
concede
the
basic
fact
as
has
been
conceded
here
that
the
divorce
dissolves
the
status
that
goes
dower,
(voice
overlap)
dower
in
florida
only
news
to
the
widow.
and
bear
in
mind,
mr.
chief
justice,
this
is
not
an
application
in
new
york
for
dower.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
this
is
an
application
in
florida
for
dower,
for
florida
property
on
a
florida
divorce
and
at
florida
law,
and
where
does
that
federal
question
become
involve
in
that.
florida
says
this
--
that
dissolves
the
status,
united
states
supreme
court
says,
this
dissolves
the
status
with
jurisdiction.
and
florida
says
you
can't
get
dower
unless
you're
a
widow.
and
you're
not
a
widow
if
you're
not
married
at
the
time
of
your
husband's
death.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
they
both
lived
in
new
york.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
they're
both
present
and
it
was
contested
in
new
york.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
she
remained
in
new
york.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well,
i
am
--
well,
our
answer
of
course
is
yes.
yes,
i
think
florida
property
is
governed
by
florida
law
and
the
properties
in
florida.
and
i
don't
think
new
york
law
can
govern
florida's
property.
that's
my
judgment
and
that's
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well
of
course,
it
would
be
an
invalid
law
ex
--
i
don't
think
that
you'll
determine
what
the
dower
laws
and
rights
are
in
florida.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
many
states
don't
have
any
dower
rights.
that's
statutory.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
i
didn't
quite
understand.
i'm
sorry.
you
mean
the
decree
for
alimony?
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
i
would
say
it
might
be
valid
new
york
but
certainly
it
wouldn't
be
valid
in
florida.
especially
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
not
if
her
husband
is
a
domicile
of
florida.
i
don't
know
how
new
york
in
the
next
statute
says
maybe
they
can
and
--
and
if
your
honor
they
can,
they
can,
that
makes
sense.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well
of
course,
your
honor,
florida's
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
that
maybe
in
reference
to
service,
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
not
having
the
facts
of
the
case,
i'm
unable
to
--
you
know,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
case.
but
all
i
can
say
is
that
if
new
york
can
pass
a
statute
which
binds
its
people
to
the
domicile
in
its
state
today.
and
when
they
move
to
florida
as
many
of
them
do,
they
are
still
bound
by
new
york
statute.
that's
a
strange
doctrine
to
my
ears
but
it
may
be
the
law.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
$440,
i
believe
your
honor.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
indeed
not,
not
under
the
estin
case?
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
not
under
the
estin
case,
he
couldn't.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
because
the
court
said
that
the
--
that
the
decree
was
procured
on
substituted
service
and
though
capable
and
efficient
to
dissolve
the
status,
it
could
not
affect
her
intangible
right
to
alimony
or
support.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
suppose
the
decree
said
that?
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well,
i
don't
know
what
the
law
of
new
york
is.
your
honors,
ask
the
supreme
court
of
florida
the
orders
case,
if
in
florida
the
florida
courts
could
require
a
husband
to
pay
after
he
died
and
the
florida
courts
answered
no.
now,
i
know
what
they
could
do
in
new
york
and
i
can't
answer
that
question.
all
i
know
is
that
whatever
they
do
in
new
york,
they
only
do
in
new
york
for
new
york
property.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
the
estin
case
actually,
although
it
started
off
on
the
theory
that
they
were
given
full
faith
and
credit
to
a
new
york
separate
maintenance
provision.
estin
case
actually
as
finally
modified
by
the
armstrong
case
and
the
vanderbilt
case
said
that
it
was
not
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
to
us
at
all.
it
was
because
they
could
not
put
out
intangible
personal
rights
by
substituted
service
in
the
state
where
the
divorce
was
granted,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well,
there
was
no
decree
--
there
was
no
decree
in
the
vanderbilt
case
and
no
decree
in
the
armstrong
case
at
the
time
the
divorce
was
granted.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well,
in
the
estin
case,
i
think
there
was
a
decree.
but
i
was
under
the
impression
that
in
the
armstrong
case
and
in
the
vanderbilt
case,
there
was
no
decree.
and
the
court
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
i'm
sorry,
i
could
be
wrong.
i
could
be
wrong.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
versus
in
new
york
(voice
overlap)
oh,
indeed
yes
sir.
oh
yes.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
wouldn't
the
company
--
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
indeed
yes.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well,
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
don't
have
to
rely
upon
it
because
it's
been
conceded.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well,
of
course
that's
--
of
course
that's
the
answer
that
the
dower
depends
upon
the
continuation
of
the
status.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
none
--
none
or
whatever
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it,
if
your
honor
please.
nothing
to
do
with
it.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
yes
sir.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
and
none
or
whatever
because
a
dower
is
an
unusual
and
inchoate
property
right
that
has
no
vested,
actually
no
vested
right
in
the
wife,
only
a
provision
that
it
becomes
effective
in
the
event
she
survives
her
husband.
there's
no
such
thing
as
dower
while
the
husband
lives.
and
there's
no
way
dower
can
arise
until
the
husband
dies
still
married
to
the
woman
that
claims
dower.
do
i
make
myself
clear?
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
well
of
course,
yes
sir,
and
under
the
estin
case
and
under
the
armstrong
case,
on
the
very
cases
of
course.
mr.
marion
e.
sibley
no
sir
that
is
an
existing
right
but
that
depended
upon
some
future
event
or
surviving
some
future
event.
that
right
persists
with
and
after
the
divorce.
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
common
law
right
of
the
wife
to
be
supported
by
her
husband.
that's
an
existing
right
though
you
referred
to
as
an
intangible
right,
it
is
a
right
that
presently
exists.
i'll
come
back
to
the
problem
that
they
suggested.
the
question
is,
far
having
granted
a
good
divorce,
one
that's
recognized
as
valid,
that
having
dissolved
the
status
is
there
a
federal
question
involved
if
the
former
wife
comes
to
florida
and
seeks
in
a
florida
court
dower
in
florida
property.
i
see
nothing
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
federal
law
there.
that
seems
to
be
a
question
for
florida's
jurisdiction.
they
have
a
right
to
decide
what
effect
of
their
divorce
decree
was
on
dower
as
allowed
by
statute
in
florida.
and
that's
the
whole
question
involved
here.
and
as
i
started
out
with,
your
honor,
i
started
out
with
--
with
the
complexity
as
to
why
this
case
is
here.
i
still
have
it
complex
here.
i
must
say
that
i
came
here
quite
and
full
with
argument
and
to
make
one
of
those
real
--
i
think
telling
speeches
and
the
court
so
well
understood
the
problem
that
i
had
very
little
to
say
as
if
i
answered
the
questions.
thank
you
very
much.
