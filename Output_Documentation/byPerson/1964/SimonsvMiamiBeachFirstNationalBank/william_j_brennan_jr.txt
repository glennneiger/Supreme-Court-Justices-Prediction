justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not
the
same.
the
jurisdiction
of
the
florida
court
entered
the
divorce
proceeding,
terminating
the
marriage.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
nevertheless,
he
was
sufficiently
obliged,
so
that
is
--
that
she
would
assert
a
dower.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
now
what
--
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
you
correctly.
the
--
after
that
far
a
divorce
could
be,
the
husband
is
free
to
remarry
without
being
--
being
bigamous
under
united
states
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you
--
what
you're
saying
is
that
he
--
his
first
wife
was
still
sufficiently
his
wife
that
that
continued
her
right
to
assert
dower
on
his
death.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
he's
not
his
wife,
(voice
overlap)
of
--
of
fining
him
if
remarry,
guilty
of
any
crime,
but
she
is
his
wife
sufficiently
have
retained
whatever
property
rights
you
say
she's
got.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
--
mr.
ward,
certainly,
(inaudible)
first
year
of
the
lawsuit,
that
dower
is
a
right
that's
attached
to
surviving
widows,
isn't
it?
now,
what
you're
talking
about
here
is
that
dower
arrangements.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
when
they
say
sufficiently
his,
wife
i
don't
think
it's
--
i
don't
think
it's
an
act
of
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
did
that
touch
do
--
dower
interest,
that
new
york
decree?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
remained
wife
until
his
death.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
assuming
that's
the
ruling
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
does
the
wife
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
he
does
have
a
standing
before
his
dower
under
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
understand
it,
she's
--
he's
as
--
as
on
the
premise
that
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
tell
us
whether
we
should
decide
this
case
on
mainly
that
florida
had
jurisdiction
to
give
the
husband
a
divorce.
she
comes
in
and
asserts
only
that.
he's
entitled
to
dower
although
she's
not
his
wife.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
ground
that
because
of
the
florida
divorce
decree
she's
not
his
wife
on
his
death
and
therefore
not
entitled
to
dower.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
one
way
of
saying,
i'm
this
man's
wife.
now,
you
see,
it's
that
missing
step
where
i
have
trouble
calling
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
on
the
ground
on
which
the
divorce
was
obtained,
this
is
independent
of
the
question
of
the
power
of
the
court
to
grant
a
divorce.
if
she
had
come
in
to
the
divorce
proceeding,
it's
conceivable
she
might
have
defeated
it
on
res
judicata.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
but
that
if
she
had,
then
i
take
that
she'd
remained
his
wife.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
she
would
have
a
dower
point.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
she
would
have
lost
that
one,
but
could
not
have
lost
the
one
that
she
had
asserted,
that
on
the
grounds
of
which
divorce
was
sought,
the
new
york
treated
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
might
have
happened
as
you
said
earlier.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
when
these
parties
lived
in
new
york.
i
don't
know
whether
the
fact
is
enough
but
assume
that
the
husband
had
owned
real
estate
in
florida
while
they
were
still
domiciliaries
in
new
york
before
the
separate
maintenance
fact.and
they've
never
had
to
parting
of
ways.
under
florida
law,
would
the
wife
have
had
a
dower
interest
in
the
florida
estate
even
though
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
if
he
had
own
a
real
estate
at
that
time
and
we
come
to
the
separate
maintenance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
we
come
to
the
separate
maintenance
decree.
if
they've
never
been
divorced
notwithstanding
the
separate
maintenance
decree
which
her
dower
right
in
florida
real
estate
could
have
been
recognized?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
what
you
have
to
defend
upon
is
that
actually
the
relationship
of
husband
and
wife
was
terminated
by
the
florida
divorce
decree.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
florida
--
and
this
new
york
decree
--
this
new
york
order
did
not
in
turn
save
to
the
wife
any
dower
interest
in
florida
decree.
