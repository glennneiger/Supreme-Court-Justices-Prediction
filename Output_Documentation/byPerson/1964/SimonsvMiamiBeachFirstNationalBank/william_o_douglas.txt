justice
william
o.
douglas
counsel
for
that,
do
you
mind
if
i
state
to
you
what
my
problem
with
your
case
is?
justice
william
o.
douglas
when
did
you
present
the
federal
--
this
federal
question,
this
full
faith
and
credit?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
wasn't
able
to
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
hope
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
i
hope
it
was
presented
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
before
the
court
of
appeals,
but
was
that
the
first
time?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
could
you
help
--
help
me
find
those
and
--
not
this
minute
i
say
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
but
during
the
course
of
your
argument.
justice
william
o.
douglas
estin
was
the
case
where
--
is
that
a
court
decree
if
taken
literally
would
have
wiped
out
the
prior
new
york
alimony
decree.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
there's
no
prior
new
york
decree
of
any
kind
that
would
be
affected
by
here
or
by
anything
that
florida
did.
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
that
estin
was
--
is
merely
an
illustration
of
your
point
but
it
isn't
quite
applicable.
