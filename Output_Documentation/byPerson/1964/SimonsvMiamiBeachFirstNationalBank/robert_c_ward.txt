mr.
robert
c.
ward
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
domestic
relations
case
arising
out
of
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
florida
courts
are
required
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
a
new
york
separation
decree
in
connection
with
the
establishment
of
a
widow's
right
to
dower
subsequent
to
the
entry
of
an
ex
parte
divorce
decree
in
the
florida
courts.
as
this
court
is
well
aware,
there's
no
tendency
for
the
solution
to
the
problem
of
the
domestic
relations
problems
that
arise
in
the
united
states.
and
i
think
that
each
case
must
be
taken
and
analyzed
by
reason
and
logic
in
order
to
reach
a
conclusion
that's
fair
to
all
of
the
parties.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
no
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
i
think
the
problem
has
been
presented
at
all
stages
of
the
proceedings,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
--
the
district
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
--
and
by
the
assignments
of
error.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
no
sir,
i
think
it
was
presented
in
the
original
assignments
of
error.
it
was
before
the
lower
court
when
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
yes
sir.
i
think
that
the
problem
has
arisen
originally
because
the
courts,
not
only
the
trial
court,
the
district
court
of
appeals,
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida
have
failed
to
recognize
the
point
that
we
attempt
to
assert.
they
have
in
each
instance
decree
that
we
were
barred
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
this
point
was
not
raised
at
the
time
the
divorce
suit
was
instituted.
the
florida
courts
have
taken
the
position
that
is
incumbent
upon
the
nonresident
wife
to
come
into
the
state
of
florida
and
to
present
this
defense
of
res
judicata
or
requiring
the
florida
court
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
new
york
separation
decree
at
the
time
that
the
husband
institutes
the
divorce
proceeding.
and
that
she
cannot
wait
until
a
subsequent
date
to
make
this
presentation.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
well,
what
could
have
been
gained,
your
honor,
is
the
rights
that
have
been
established
by
the
new
york
decree
that
the
wife
is
--
that
this
woman
was
to
remain
the
wife
of
this
man
and
to
participate
in
his
estate.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
no
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
on
--
by
the
wife
or
by
the
husband
on
separate
grounds,
not
on
the
grounds
that
were
adjudicated
in
this
particular
course
of
action.
and
that
is
the
point
that
we
--
we
argue
here.
as
this
court
is
well
aware,
there
is
advanced
distinction
between
a
separate
maintenance
decree
and
a
divorce
decree.
there
are
rights
that
remain
to
the
person
receiving
the
benefit
of
that
decree
in
a
separation
decree
that
do
not
remain
after
divorce
decree.
and
the
basic
and
main
right
is
not
only
the
right
to
support
but
it's
the
right
to
participate
in
the
husband's
estate
and
to
assert
this
dower
right.
the
inchoate
right
of
dower
remains
when
you
grant
a
separation
decree
to
a
wife,
she,
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
remains
the
wife
of
that
man
but
entitled
to
live
separate
and
apart
and
upon
his
death
has
the
right
to
participate
in
his
estate
by
way
of
the
inchoate
right
of
dower
attaching
and
become
choate.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
well,
your
honor,
from
the
outset
mr.
justice
goldberg,
let
me
explain
this.
we
do
not
take
the
position
and
i
think
we
cannot
on
the
state
of
this
record
that
the
florida
court
did
not
in
fact
have
jurisdiction
to
enter
the
divorce
decree
because
that
is
based
upon
the
disputed
issue
of
fact
which
was
resolved
against
us.
our
position
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
no
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
no
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
no
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
that's
right.
we
disputed
that
and
lost
it.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
no
sir.
not
insofar
as
it
affects
--
it
affects
marital
status.
i
might
point
out
at
this
point
that
the
sole
basis
of
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
here
is
based
upon
this
court's
decisions
in
the
estin
versus
estin
case
and
later
in
this
armstrong
case
and
the
vanderbilt
case,
the
theory
of
divisible
divorce.
we
do
not
contend
here
that
insofar
as
this
man
was
concerned,
mr.
simon,
that
florida
did
not
have
a
right
to
affect
his
marital
status
insofar
as
it
affected
society
and
affected
his
rights
to
--
to
remarry
or
to
live
with
another
woman
or
to
this
--
that
this
decree
could
in
anyway
illegitimatize,
if
there
is
such
a
word,
his
children,
if
he
had
remarried.
we
don't
have
that
case
here.
he
did
not
remarried
but
i
--
we
do
not
attack
the
--
the
marital
status
as
established
by
this
court
in
distinguishing
indivisible
divorce,
in
distinguishing
between
marital
status
on
one
--
one
side
and
on
the
other
side
the
property
rights
of
the
wife.
the
point
we
raise
is
this,
is
in
new
york
with
both
people
there,
these
people
were
married
in
new
york.
they
remained
residents
of
new
york.
they
had
a
very
hotly
contested
new
york
litigation
which
is
shown
by
the
decree
in
the
record,
wherein
the
court
in
new
york
found
that
the
husband
had
been
guilty
of
extreme
cruelty
towards
the
wife
or
cruelty
and
inhuman
treatment.
and
that
therefore,
she
was
entitled
to
live
separate
or
apart
from
him.
and
that
she
was
entitled
to
receive
support
from
him.
now,
inherent
in
that
decree
is
also
the
proposition
that
she
was
entitled
insofar
as
her
property
rights
were
concerned
to
remain
his
wife
so
that
she
would
be
entitled
upon
his
death
to
assert
a
dower
claim
if
he
wrote
her
out
of
his
will.
now
with
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
yes
sir,
she
was
of
that
same
sufficiently
his
wife
to
assert
the
dower
claim
as
this
court
has
ruled,
she
had
sufficiently
his
wife
to
assert
an
alimony
claim
subsequent
to
an
ex
parte
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
no
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
no,
mr.
--
i'd
say
this.
that
is
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
that
is
correct,
insofar
as
it
affected
her
marital
rights.
that's
correct.
insofar
as
it
affected
her
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
property
rights,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
i'm
saying
this,
your
honor,
that
insofar
as
florida
is
concerned
and
we're
not
here
concerned
with
whether
new
york
would
have
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
florida
decree
at
all,
that
was
not
involved.
what
i'm
saying
is
this,
is
that
new
york
has
decreed
on
a
--
or
these
two
people
had
their
day
in
court
in
new
york
and
--
and
the
--
the
decree
was
rendered
against
the
husband.
it
was
found
that
he
was
at
fault
and
therefore
the
wife
had
the
right
to
live
separate
and
apart
from
him.
now,
if
he
subsequently
goes
to
florida,
and
under
this
court's
theory
on
the
estin
cases
and
in
those
other
cases.
he
can
go
down
there
and
you
have
said
that
florida
has
the
right
because
he's
a
domicile.
they
have
the
right
to
--
to
change
his
marital
status,
so
that
in
the
betterment
of
society
and
in
the
betterment
of
family
relations
that
his
children
would
be
legitimate
if
he
remarried,
and
that
sort
of
thing,
that
florida
has
the
right
to
do
that.
but
that
that
would
not
affect
the
wife's
or
the
former
wife's
rights
who
lives
in
another
state
insofar
as
alimony
or
her
property
rights.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
i
would
assume
so,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
that
property
right,
yes,
the
same
that
she
has
the
property
right
to
assert
--
to
make
him
pay
alimony.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
she
has
retained
her
property
rights
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
well,
i
know
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
i
would
agree
with
you,
justice
black.
i
don't
think
it's
sufficiently,
following
justice
brennan's
remarks,
i
was
just
answering
him
but
i
--
i
say
this,
you
got
to
separate
which
this
court
did
by
their
ruling
in
estin
v.
estin.
you
got
to
separate
it.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
yes
sir.
there
is
the
prior
new
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
no
sir.
i
don't
say
that
it's
100%
applicable.
you
must
start
from
the
theory
that
there
is
such
thing
as
divisible
divorce
which
this
court
has
announced.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
and
what
i'm
talking
about
is
that
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
what
i'm
--
what
i
am
talking
about
is
that
the
new
york
court
has
decreed
in
a
litigated
two-party
proceeding
where
both
people
who
were
before
the
court,
that
this
woman
was
entitled
to
live
separate
and
apart
from
this
man
and
that
he
wasn't
entitled
to
live
separate
and
apart
from
her
or
to
get
a
divorce
from
her.
now,
the
question
is
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
inherently,
yes
sir
because
inherently
it
is
said
that
she
has
the
right
to
live
separate
and
apart
from
him
but
--
and
--
and
to
receive
support
from
him
but
she
has
the
right
to
re
--
if
nothing
else
would
have
happened,
if
this
divorce
hadn't
been
entered,
she
would
have
obviously
had
the
right
to
assert
a
dower
claim
against
his
estate.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
no
sir,
i
don't
think
not
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
no
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
it
could
have
been
if
it
was
based
upon
different
grounds.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
no.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
no,
justice
white.
i
don't
want
to
answer
that
question.
the
question
is
that
he
tried
to
and
got
a
divorce
in
florida
off
on
grounds
that
were
the
same
as
those
that
had
already
been
adjudicated
in
new
york
and
i
say
he
can't
do
that.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
no
sir.
i
don't
--
i'm
talking
about
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
i
think
originally
if
she
would
have
gone
in
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
no.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
they
had
been
adjudicated
by
the
new
york
separation
decree.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
if
you
take
it
that
far,
yes.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
it
was
res
jud
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
it
was
res
judicata
on
the
issues
presented
to
the
florida
court.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
well
your
honor,
my
case
depends
upon
this
court
extending
the
doctrine
of
divisible
divorce
to
determine
what
florida
did
was
this,
they
have
ruled
that
this
woman
cannot
later,
after
this
man
dies
and
when
this
right
of
dower
then
becomes
choate
cannot
come
in
and
assert
the
new
york
decree.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
it
was
not
a
proper
divorce
insofar
as
it
affected
her
property
rights
in
her
husband's
estate.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
if
you
recognized
the
doctrine
of
divisible
divorce,
no
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
that's
right.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
that's
right.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
no
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
that
was
what
was
asserted
in
this
last
suit
that's
before
the
court
now.
and
the
florida
court
did
not
rule
that
it
was
a
res
judicata
or
did
not
rule
on
the
fact
that
whether
it
was
or
was
not.
they
said
that
it
wasn't
available.
that
this
was
a
defense
that
this
woman
had
to
present
at
the
time
the
divorce
suit
was
filed,
and
i
say
that's
wrong.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
no
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
on
the
disputed
issues,
i
can
--
i
don't
--
i
cannot
dispute
it.
no
sir
on
the
finding
of
disputed
fact
as
contained
in
the
record.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
i
don't
believe
so
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
the
court
had
no
knowledge
of
it,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
right.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
right.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
insofar
as
it
asserts
a
right
that
was
not
adjudicated
by
the
florida
court.
and
that
is
the
property
right
of
the
wife
to
claim
dower
in
his
estate,
the
same
as
it
flowed
out
into
the
alimony
right.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
no
sir.
not
when
she
didn't
appear
anymore
than
her
alimony
rights
were
cut
off,
her
property
rights
could
have
been
determined
by
an
ex
parte
proceeding.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
that's
correct.
yes
sir,
as
far
as
they
could.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
well,
it
didn't
settle
anymore
than
the
new
york
court
settled
it
because
the
new
york
court
had
said
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
well
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
but
--
but
if
one
court
establishes
in
a
--
in
an
adversary
proceeding,
her
right
to
remain
a
wife
and
to
assert
this
right
in
an
adversary
proceeding,
the
question
is,
can
another
court
based
upon
the
same
set
of
facts
on
an
ex
parte
proceeding
take
that
right
away
from
her?
mr.
robert
c.
ward
on
the
set
of
fact
that
was
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
that's
right.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
it
was
the
kind
of
decree
that
she
sued
for
separate
maintenance.
and
he
in
turn
defended
it
on
a
set
of
facts
which
were
ruled
against
it.
and
i'd
say
that
under
those
circumstances,
it's
the
same
as
this.
if
court
a
with
both
parties
before
him
rules
on
a
point,
it
set
the
facts
as
presented
to
point
a
or
to
court
a.
and
court
a
rules
on
them
one
way.
the
same
sets
of
facts
were
presented
to
court
b
in
an
ex
parte
proceeding.
and
the
court
rules
differently
than
court
a
did.
now,
you
have
two
judgments.
you
have
a
judgment
of
court
a
and
a
judgment
of
court
b.
now,
if
court
--
if
this
is
presented
--
and
that's
all
that
happened
here
was
when
this
woman
and
when
this
woman
presented
her
claim
for
dower
in
the
florida
courts,
the
florida
courts
was
faced
with
this
and
this
is
the
simplification
of
the
problem.
they
had
a
judgment
in
court
a
and
a
judgment
in
court
b.
now,
which
one
do
they
recognize?
mr.
robert
c.
ward
that's
right.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
well,
how
can
we
be
bound
by
res
judicata
in
a
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
might
in
the
beginning
answer,
mr.
justice
douglas'
question
as
to
where
this
constitutional
question
is
raised
in
the
record
on
page
10
of
the
record
and
then
in
the
complaint,
the
original
complaint,
and
in
the
original
assignments
of
error
to
the
district
court
of
appeals,
third
district
of
florida
on
page
318
of
the
record,
one
of
the
assignments
of
error
is
covered
by
the
full
faith
and
credit.
i
think,
to
conclude
my
opening
presentation,
the
question
presented
here
is
when
if
we
assume
first
that
if
this
new
york
decree,
and
i
think
we
must
assume
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
it
was
a
decree
of
separate
maintenance
awarded
to
the
wife
decreeing
that
the
husband
had
been
guilty
of
extreme
cruelty,
cruel
and
inhuman
punishment
or
treatment
to
the
wife
and
that
she
was
entitled
to
live
separate
and
apart
from
him
and
to
receive
from
him,
i
think
it
was
$400
a
month
that
the
appellant
court
ult
--
ultimately
set
as
alimony
or
separate
maintenance.
it's
what
the
decree,
the
new
york
decree
actually
provided.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
i'm
relying
upon
the
determination
by
the
new
york
court
of
the
issues
before
it,
that
is
who
was
guilty
of
extreme
cruelty
to
whom
because
the
decree
in
the
florida
court
filed
by
the
husband
was
also
based
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
well,
it
would
make
this
different
that
if
--
if
--
that
if
the
decree
in
new
york
had
not
been
based
upon
the
same
ground
as
the
florida
decree
then
florida
decree
would
not
in
--
in
this
instance,
the
new
york
decree
would
not
been
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
--
and
most
every
court.
the
only
theory
upon
which
we
advance
this
is
that
the
adjudication
that
this
divorce
that
was
granted
the
husband
in
florida
was
based
upon
a
factual
situation
that
had
already
been
presented
to
the
new
york
court
and
ruled
adversely.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
i'm
attacking
the
divorce
insofar
as
it's
enforceability
against
the
wife
to
affect
her
dower
rights.
the
question
becomes
this
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
when
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
yes
sir,
her
property
right
to
participate
in
this
man's
estate.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
no
sir,
it
would
--
it
would
flow
from
it
as
long
as
they
remain
husband
and
wife.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
but
as
long
as
they
are
never
separated
for
cause
that's
created
by
the
wife
and
as
long
as
the
grounds
upon
which
the
--
the
florida
decree
was
based,
it
had
already
been
ruled
upon
adversely
to
the
husband.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
no
sir,
not
completely.
my
--
my
--
the
whole
basis
of
the
suit
here
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
new
york
decree
is
res
judicata
as
to
the
issues
that
were
framed
in
the
florida
divorce
action.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
yes
sir.
it
would
bar
a
divorce
on
those
grounds.
now,
the
question
arises,
when
must
the
wife
assert
this
new
york
decree
in
order
to
preserve
her
rights
to
participate
in
the
husband's
estate,
the
dower?
obviously,
in
this
case,
if
she's
represented
it,
we
assume
that
if
she's
represented
it
at
the
time
that
the
husband
filed
a
suit
for
divorce
in
florida
and
the
florida
courts
had
--
had
recognized
it
and
--
and
said,
“yes,
the
new
york
decree
is
res
judicata
on
the
issues
of
extreme
cruelty.”
then
in
that
instance,
the
husband's
divorce
would
have
been
denied
and
she
would
have
remained
obviously
as
his
wife
and
been
entitled
upon
his
death
to
participate
in
his
estate
as
dower.
now,
if
the
wife
does
not
appear
in
the
florida
proceedings,
can
she
later
assert
that
same
decree
and
is
the
florida
court
required
to
give
it
full
faith
and
credit
in
relation
to
asserting
her
claim
to
participate
in
the
husband's
estate
on
the
grounds
that
she
--
on
the
dower
questions
which
has
never
been
decreed.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
i
cannot
take
any
other
position
under
the
state
of
the
record.
the
florida
court
has
twice
ruled
it
had
jurisdiction
over
mr.
simon
once
in
the
original
divorce
decree
and
once
initiates
on
this
record
on
the
disputed
question
of
fact.
so
i'm
--
i'm
therefore
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
no
sir,
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
the
premise
that
it
was
too
late
for
this
woman
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
they
went
on
the
premise
that
it
was
too
late
for
this
woman
to
plead
this
new
york
decree
to
--
to
--
to
assert
her
rights.
that's
what
they
did.
they
said
that
--
that
this
--
that
now,
that
--
that
her
only
occasion
to
protect
her
rights,
her
dower
rights,
her
only
occasion
to
assert
that
right
and
protect
that
right
was
when
this
husband,
after
leaving
the
state
of
new
york
and
going
to
the
state
of
florida,
and
instituting
a
divorce
suit
in
florida
by
which
he
searched
her
constructively
that
she
is
required
to
then
sojourn
herself
to
florida
which
is
a
foreign
jurisdiction
to
her
completely,
never
having
resided
there
that
she
must
then
go
to
florida
and
defend
herself.
and
if
she
doesn't,
she's
forever
barred
and
this
new
york
decree
means
nothing.
so
therefore,
the
husband,
by
reason
of
this
sojourning
around
the
united
states
can
obtain
an
advantage
over
the
wife
on
a
matter
that's
already
been
litigated
in
new
york.
and
that's
the
question.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
to
protects
a
right
that's
already
been
decided
in
her
favor
in
new
york,
i
don't
think
that
she
has
to
go
all
over
the
united
states.
it's
for
--
it
would
make
no
difference
under
the
doctrine
going
back
to
divisible
divorce
of
his
marital
status
as
such
insofar
as
his
rights
to
not
be
prosecuted
for
bigamy
such
as
was
involved
in
williams
versus
north
carolina
in
those
cases.
and
his
obligations
to
society
in
his
--
whether
or
not
subsequent
children
of
a
marriage
of
his
would
be
legitimate.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
no
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
no
sir
because
you
were
personally
served
in
nevada.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
that's
the
distinction
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
insofar
as
it
--
as
it
affects
marital
status.
but
this
court
has
ruled
that
--
that
that
doesn't
require
the
wife
to
appear
and
assert
her
alimony
rights
or
right
to
support,
her
right
to
maintenance
or
property
rights
under
pennoyer
versus
neff.
and
that's
--
that's
my
distinction.
i'm
merely
asking
the
court
to
follow
the
same
distinction
that
they
followed
in
these
other
cases.
that
this
is
a
property
right
and
it
is
a
vested
property
right
by
the
new
york
decree
if
the
florida
decree
is
based
upon
the
same
facts.
and
we
must
analyze
this
case
from
the
facts
in
the
record,
not
as
a
broad
general
principle
but
as
the
facts
are
presented
here
on
whether
or
not
this
decree
is
entitled
to
the
full
faith
and
credit.
it
forms
--
it
comes
down
to
this.
when
must
this
woman
--
when
is
this
woman
required
to
assert
this
new
york
decree
in
order
to
protect
her
rights
to
participate
in
her
husband's
estate.
if
you
say
that
she
must
sojourn
herself
around
the
united
states
and
follow
this
husband
and
that
--
and
in
order
to
protect
her
rights,
then
i
have
no
standing.
if
you
say
as
you
did
in
the
--
as
i
interpret
the
estin
cases
and
the
armstrong
case,
and
the
vanderbilt
case,
if
you
say
no
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
divisible
divorce,
that
--
that
the
husband
can
get
a
divorce
insofar
that
it
affects
his
social
obligations
but
it
does
not
affect
the
wife's
property
rights,
then
my
client
has
preserved
this
right
to
assert
this
new
york
decree
insofar
as
asserting
her
dower
rights.
and
that
seems
logical
because
dower
in
of
itself
is
in
--
inchoate.
she
would
have
no
right
to
sue
in
any
court
or
sue
him
in
florida
as
long
as
he
was
alive.
her
rights
to
dower
only
arise
and
become
choate
and
become
enforceable
if
she
survives
this
man.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
well
this
is
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
she
comes
in
and
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
no
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
she
comes
in
into
the
florida
courts
and
asserts
that
she
is
her
--
his
wife.
the
--
the
executors
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
she
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
and
they
--
she
comes
in
and
asserts
her
right
to
dower.
the
executor
of
the
estate
comes
in
and
pleads
the
florida
divorce
decree
and
claims
that
that
is
res
judicata
of
the
issues
that
whether
or
not
she's
entitled
to
dower.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
right.
then
she
comes
back
and
pleads
the
new
york
separate
maintenance
decree
that
says
that
that's
res
judicata
on
the
issues
they
were
presented
in
the
divorce
case.
and
therefore,
she
is
entitled
to
dower.
now,
you
must
assume
that
the
new
york
decree
was
res
judicata
on
the
issues
that
were
in
the
subsequent
divorce
decree.
and
that's
what
i
say
is
the
whole
gist
of
this
case.
that
she
has
the
right,
she
can't
be
barred
by
an
ex
parte
proceeding
on
a
husband.
she
won
once
in
court
does
she
have
to
chase
this
man
all
over
the
united
states
defending
this
right.
or
can
she
wait
until
that
arises
and
assert
it?
and
can
the
florida
court,
when
she
--
when
the
right
ones
arises,
and
then
it
only
arises
when
this
husband
dies,
so
long
as
he
continues
to
pay
the
support
payments,
she
has
no
right
of
action
against
him.
but
when
this
right
arises,
that
she
asserts
yes
under
the
fact,
i'm
this
man's
--
i
have
a
property
right
in
his
estate.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
well,
you
must
--
you
must
take
the
position
that
her
--
her
rights
to
participate
in
the
husband's
estate
have
never
been
adjudicated
in
the
--
in
the
ex
parte
divorce
proceeding
anymore
than
her
rights
to
support
from
the
husband.
and
that's
why
i
say
to
the
court
that
that
issue
that
we
are
entitled
to
plead
that
new
york
decree
in
order
to
establish
that
right.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
mr.
chief
justice,
i
only
have
one
or
two
remarks
to
make
in
rebuttal.
i
would
like
to
recall
and
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
history
of
the
divorce
cases
that
have
appeared
in
this
court
and
the
theory
that
has
evolved
into
what
i
now
have
referred
to
as
divisible
divorce.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
well,
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
robert
c.
ward
alright,
i
will
eliminate
it
from
you,
sir,
any
further.
but
this
court
has
said
many
times
in
all
kinds
of
cases
and
particularly
in
these
--
this
type
of
case
that
everybody
is
entitled
to
their
day
in
court.
and
that
the
basic
philosophy
of
this
whole
thing
of
the
wife's
rights
not
being
wiped
out
by
ex
parte
proceedings
was
solely
that
she
wouldn't
become
a
public
charge.
now,
what
i'm
saying
here
and
what
i
am
asking
this
court
to
do
is
not
to
allow
a
--
somebody
come
in
10
years
later
and
present
a
defense,
they
may
have
had
in
litigation.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
would
have
the
right
to
do
that,
any
court
would.i
think
that
basic
premise
has
been
established.
what
i'd
say
is
that
when
the
parties
have
had
their
day
in
court
and
they
have
fully
litigated
an
issue
that
one
of
the
parties
should
not
be
entitled
to
run
to
another
jurisdiction
and
in
an
ex
parte
proceeding
which
is
another
effect
of
fraud
upon
the
florida
court
in
this
case
wipe
out
this
woman's
rights.
mr.
robert
c.
ward
on
the
new
york
case.
and
wiped
out
this
woman's
rights
and
then
say
when
she
comes
in
to
assert
her
rights,
under
this
decree
that
she
got
when
both
she
and
her
husband
had
their
day
in
court,
they
say
on
a
procedural
technicality,
well
it's
too
late
to
present
that
now.
you
should
have
presented
it
years
ago.
i'd
say
that's
not
only
not
granting
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
new
york
decree,
that's
depriving
this
woman
of
her
equal
protection
under
the
law
and
due
process.
they
litigated
this
matter.
they
litigated
it
together.
they
had
the
day
in
court
and
for
him
to
go
off
now
in
another
jurisdiction
on
an
ex
parte
proceedings
and
wiped
out
her
rights,
i
say
cannot
be
done
under
the
federal
constitution.
and
that's
why
i
say
that
this
new
york
decree
should
be
granted
full
faith
and
credit.
the
florida
court
should
be
required
to
say,
“yes,
that
issue
was
litigated,
did
new
york
decree
is
res
judicata
and
she
is
entitled
to
enforce
this
property
right
because
marital
status
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
now
because
the
man
is
dead.
she's
enforcing
this
property
right
in
his
estate.
and
i
believe
that
it
should
be
enforced
else
she's
been
deprived
of
her
constitutional
rights.
