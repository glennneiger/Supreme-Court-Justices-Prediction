justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
that
the
court
had
jurisdiction
to
grant
--
jurisdiction
of
the
case
now
in
court,
and
they
made
a
mistake
in
granting
the
divorce.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
you
--
i
thought
you
said
they
weren't
entitled
to
grant
the
divorce
in
that
jurisdiction
but
they
made
a
mistake,
namely
they
didn't
--
they
--
they
shouldn't
have
granted
a
divorce
on
the
ground
they
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
a
while
ago,
you
said
a
while
ago
that
the
florida
court
was
not
entitled
to
grant
a
divorce
on
the
ground
that
it
used
because
that
ground
was
precluded
by
the
--
by
the
new
york
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
is
what
i
asked
you
a
while
ago.
i
thought
you
answered
me
it
didn't
make
any
difference
what
the
grounds
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
which
is
by
the
lower
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
florida
--
the
florida
court
should
not
have
granted
a
divorce
on
those
grounds.
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
exactly
--
that's
absolutely
contrary
to
what
you've
said
a
while
ago
to
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
should
or
should
not
the
florida
court
have
granted
a
divorce
from
the
grounds
that
it
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
if
you
answer
the
question,
should
it
--
should
it
have
granted
a
divorce
from
the
grounds
that
it
did
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
those
grounds
were
not
available
to
the
new
york
or
florida
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
there
was
no
divorce.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
full
faith
and
credit
ground
is
good.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
there
was
no
divorce.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
full
faith
and
credit?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
there
was
no
divorce?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
your
point
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
would
still
be
bigamist
when
he
remarry?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
yes,
but
you're
saying
that
this
ground
was
not
available
before
the
court
to
use
it
as
--
as
a
divorce.
that
the
ground
had
been
adjudicated
in
new
york
that
he
was
entitled
to
use
that
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
florida
court
shouldn't
have
entered
a
decree
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
tell
them
they
shouldn't
have
entered
--
entered
a
decree?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
if
a
counsel
have
--
did
--
did
you
say
to
the
--
the
florida
courts
that
this
ground
was
unavailable
on
res
judicata
in
full
faith
and
credit
ground?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
didn't
--
and
--
and
you
didn't
commit
on
that
divorce
suit
at
all,
did
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
which
was
your
--
but
you
concede
there
was
residence.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
judgment
in
court
b
--
court
b,
the
court
has
jurisdiction.
you
admit
there
were
(inaudible)
you
had
noticed
in
the
proceeding,
was
not
here
litigated.
the
lower
court
decided
that
you
may
have
had
the
defense
if
that
--
in
a
divorce
--
in
a
divorce
case.
isn't
it
not
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
once
that
agreement
is
being
entered
in
the
case,
you
might
--
you
may
be
bound
by
res
judicata.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
kind
of
service,
would
you
mind
repeating?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they
were
used,
that
doesn't
affect
your
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
it'd
different
if
--
if
at
this
point
she
did
question
the
residence
of
the
husband
in
florida
and
the
jurisdiction
of
work.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
that
they
mean
--
