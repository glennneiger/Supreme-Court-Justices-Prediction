justice

just
before
you
do

--
launch
under
the
facts,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
what
your
point
is?
what
is
the
crucial
word?
is
it
that
this
is
not
a
sale
or
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it's
not
an
exchange
or
that
that
was
a
transfer.
it
was
not
a
capital
asset?
it
has
--
justice

stewart
you
only
have
to
say
something
is
not?
justice

right.

it

well

well

now,
you
mean
there
was
no
gain?
justice

yes.
justice

i
know
but
i

but
i
think

your
brief,
as
i
understood
your
brief,
i
mean
--
justice

stewart
--
your
brief
said
this
was
not
a
sale
and
now
--
justice

stewart
--
i
think
you're
rather

part
of
the

price?
justice

stewart
well,
i
just
want
to
be
sure
what

upon
what's
your
theory
is
based,
i
--
justice

stewart
well,
i
suppose
a

you
owe
me
$100,000
payable
over
--
$10,000
a
year
over
10
years,
i'd
suppose
that
had
a
right
to
income

--
justice

--
follow
either
one.
justice
potter
stewart
in
order
for
there
to
be
a
sale?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i've
made
you
get
way
ahead
of
yourself
and
i'm
sorry
but
i
want
to
understand
it
much
better
after
you
go
into
preliminary
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
amount
of
the
lease
was
90%
of
the
profit.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
could
but
the
--
you're
satisfied
to
call
that
a
lease?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
not
the
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
who
is
“they”?
justice
potter
stewart
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
they
would
have
paid
the
capital
gains
tax
on
liquidation.
justice
potter
stewart
the
big
difference
though
is
that
they
have
paid
--
kept
the
corporation.
they
would
have
spent
title
to
its
earnings
and
profits
as
stockholders
in
perpetuity.
justice
potter
stewart
here,
they
--
they're
entitled
to
$1,300,000
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
at
the
outset,
i
thought
you
said
it
couldn't
have.
it's
really
just
the
income.
it
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
not
installment
payment
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
reason
i
have
been
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
probably
getting
that
is
that
i
conceive
of
income
as
the
income
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
capital
in
perpetuity
or
at
least
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
from
an
indefinite
period
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
up
until

--
justice

extraordinary
income,
i
don't
see

justice

and
you
pay
annually
on
that
as
ordinary
income.
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
mr.
barnett,
you're
speaking
in
terms
of
simple
cases.
let
me
give
you
a
simple
case,
tell
me
what
the
tax
consequences
would
be?
we're
talking
about
general
motors
stock
and
let's
say
i
have
some
which
i
haven't
--
and
i
transferred
--
and
this
stock,
pays
a
thousand
dollars
a
year
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
dividends
in
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
moment
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
dividends
and
its
market
value
is
a
$100,000
and
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
let's
make
it
a
$150,000
and
i
transfer
it
to
you
and
you
sale
--
well,
you
buy
it
for
a
$150,000,
and
you
give
me
a
promissory
note
and
you'd
--
the
agreement
is
that
you'd
pay
me
of
the
sales
price
at
$10,000
a
year
for
15
years.
and
i
forgot
about
interest
and
(inaudible)
--
forget
about
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
--
now
who
--
what
happens
then?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
payable
right
out
of
assuming
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
self-liquidating
pay
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let
us
assume
it's
--
that
can
be
shown
that
the
money
you
used
to
pay
it
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
dividends
from
that
very
stock.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
sale,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
on
a
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
glad
you
did
so
i
don't
have
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
why
wouldn't
your
first
case
you're
abused

be
a
capital
gain
and
why
--
and
what
would
the
difference?
if
you
look
at
the
--
well,
that's
a
sales
price,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
in
your
opinion
is
a
crucial
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
kinsey,
i
should
know
the
answer
to
your
question
but
i
don't.
are
there
explicit
findings
here
as
to
the
fairness
of
the
price
or
the
economic
reality
of
the
price?
justice
potter
stewart
you
refer
in
the
record,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
but
suppose
it's
a
matter
of
economics
it
wouldn't
be
exactly
a

justice
potter
stewart
mr.
barnett,
i
might
understand
by
your
eagerness
to
dispute
this
fair
and
--
fact
finding
that
you
think
it's
crucial,
do
you
think
--
justice

so,
if
the

justice

stewart
let's
forget
the
father-son
because
that's
not
involved
here
really.
justice

mr.
smith
and
mr.

and
if
the
value
is
a
thousand
dollars,
what's
–
why
isn't
that
a
sale?
justice

stewart
why
wouldn't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
value
is
a
thousand
dollars,
why
wouldn't

justice

--
somebody
sell
it
for
a

somebody
else
buy
it

justice

you're
all
giving
it
away
pretty
freely
before
lunch.
justice
potter
stewart
if
--
you
told
us
that
the

whether
or
not
this
was
sold
on
its
real
value,
it's
not
crucial
to
your
case
(voice

justice

then
is
it
crucial
to
your
case
if
there
was

you're
suggesting
that
the

that
the

may

change
the
law
for
you.
