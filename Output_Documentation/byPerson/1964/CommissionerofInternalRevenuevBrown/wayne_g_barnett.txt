mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
an
income
tax
case
and
it
is
i
think
one
of
very
special
importance.
it
involves
a
form
of
transaction.
it
has
become
standardized,
has
been
widely
exploited
and
widely
publicized.
under
which
the
stockholders
are
closely
held
corporation,
transfer
the
stock
to
a
tax
exempt
charity.
on
the
charity's
promise
to
remit
to
them
all
the
earnings
of
the
business
until
they
have
received
a
--
some
prescribed
amount.
the
question
is
whether
the
earnings
remitted
to
the
stockholders
are
taxable
then
as
ordinary
income
or
as
capital
gain
that
is
as
gain
from
sale
or
exchange
of
the
capital
assets.
the
respondent's
contend
that
such
transaction
is
a
sale
and
that
the
earnings
remitted
to
them
--
to
the
stockholders
are
simply
payments
of
a
purchased
price
and
thus,
amounts
realized
from
a
sale
taxable
as
capital
gain.
we
contend
that
what
the
stockholders
have
is
simply
a
right
to
the
future
income
which
when
received
must
be
taxed
to
them
as
income.
basically
in
our
view,
the
transaction
is
simply
a
gift
of
a
remainder
in
busi
--
in
a
business.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
is
not
a
sale.
it
may
--
it
may
be
a
tax
within
another
character,
i
would
deal
with
that
later.
it
is
not
an
installment
sale.
not
--
the
question
also
is
whether
these
receipts
in
the
later
years
are
proceeds
of
the
sale
and
these
receipts
are
not
proceeds
of
the
sale.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
not
at
all,
not
at
all.
i
think
a
taxpayer
can
do
anything
in
the
world
he
wants
to,
motivated
solely
for
tax
purposes
and
the
transaction
stands
or
falls
for
what
it
is
regardless
of
why
he
did
it.
if
in
this
case
they
had
not
done
it
for
tax
purposes,
you
would
have
no
doubt
at
all
that
it
was
gift.
if
they'd
done
this
transaction
because
they
were
charitably
motivated
and
simply
wanted
to
give
something
for
cancer
research,
there
would
be
no
question
if
this
would
be
a
gift
with
retained
interest.
now
just
as
a
transaction
is
no
worse
because
it
was
done
for
tax
purposes
likewise
it
is
no
better
because
it
is
done
for
tax
purposes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
let
me
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
quite
correct.
i
wanted
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
the
case
and
take
you
on
at
a
later
point.
i
haven't
really
given
the
facts
at
all
and
i
think
it
may
be
helpful
at
some
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
transfer
is
capital
asset.
the
asset
is
capital
asset.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
transfer
may
have
been
a
sale
or
exchange
without
at
the
moment
the
same
of
which
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
was
held
for
six
months.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
actually,
the
more
universal
question
and
the
question
which
i
think
i
would
emphasize
in
argument
is
whether
the
amounts
realized.
the
gain
is
the
amount
realized
from
the
sale.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
and
our
basic
argument
is
that
these
amounts
were
not
amounts
realized
from
the
transaction
even
if
the
transaction
was
a
sale
or
exchange
of
some
sort.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
let
me
say,
if
i
exchange
my
house
for
a
share
of
general
motor
stock
that's
a
taxable
exchange.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
dividends
i
thereafter
receive
on
the
general
motor's
stock
are
taxable
as
capital
gain.
they
are
taxed
as
ordinary
income.
the
only
thing
that
is
taxed
is
capital
gain
is
the
value
at
the
time
of
the
exchange
of
the
thing
received.
if
there
was
a
taxable
exchange
in
this
case
as
a
result
of
liquidation,
what
was
re
--
the
gain
is
measured
by
the
value
then
of
what
they
received,
not
the
later
proceeds,
not
the
income
distributed
to
them
in
later
years
from
the
interest
they
acquired
in
the
exchange.
now
i'm
getting
very
far
ahead
of
what
are
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
the
brief
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
opening
brief
frames
the
question
in
terms
of
what
are
the
requirements
of
an
installment
sale.
an
installment
sale
is
a
particular
kind
of
sale.
it
is
a
transfer
of
property
exchange
for
debt.
and
that
is
the
one
case,
the
one
exception
in
which
the
later
payments
of
the
debt,
the
later
receipts
are
treated
as
an
amount
realized.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct,
only
if
it
is
a
debt.
now,
there
are
other
kinds
of
sales
or
exchanges.
the
reason
--
our
reply
brief
is
basic
--
directed
in
the
argument
of
amici
that
say,
"well,
perhaps
it
was
an
installment
sale
but
surely
there
was
some
kind
of
taxable
event
because
it
was
a
liquidation",
and
i
agree
with
them.
i
think
there
was
a
taxable
event
and
i
think
the
respondent
should
have
been
taxed
in
1953
in
the
year
of
the
transaction
on
the
full
value
of
the
asset
as
capital
gain.
but
that
would
not
affect
the
treatment
of
their
subsequent
receipt
of
the
future
earnings
that
were
remitted
to
them.
as
i
say,
i
am
getting
very
far
ahead
of
my
argument.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
ultimately
the
question
to
my
mind
is,
even
in
payment
terms
of
the
word
“sale”,
the
word
not
realized,
it
doesn't
really
make
a
difference.
ultimately,
the
question
is,
is
what
they
had
after
the
transaction,
a
debt
or
a
right
to
income?
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
a
right
to
income,
an
income
interest.
that's
the
ultimate
question.
if
what
they
had
would
was
a
debt
they
would
agree
that
the
later
payment
can
be
related
back
and
treated
as
amounts
realized
from
the
original
transaction.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
think
not.
but
i
hope
so,
it
is
the
essence
of
a
debt
but
just
--
let
me
for
the
moment
take
the
poller
case.
look
it
down
to
draw
and
define
the
lines
later.
the
right
to
income
is
a
right
to
payments
if
and
when
--
and
only
if
and
when
there
is
income.
a
debt
in
the
poller
case
is
a
right
to
be
paid
an
amount
in
all
events
regardless
of
whether
there's
income,
regardless
of
any
future
event.
now,
those
are
the
poller
cases.
and
i
agree
that
--
a
thing
may
still
be
a
debt
even
though
they've
got
absolute
certainty
of
payment,
even
though
there
is
a
very
substantial
risk
of
nonpayment.
but
--
when
i
come
to
draw
in
the
line,
my
answer
is,
there
must
be
a
cushion
of
some
sort,
something
that
shifts
the
primary
risks
to
the
transferee
and
gives
the
transferor
at
least
some
insulation
from
the
future
risk
of
the
business.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
in
order
for
there
be
--
to
be
a
debt.
now,
we
used
“sale”
in
our
opening
brief
as
an
exchange
for
a
debt.
that's
what
--
that
is
an
installment
sale
and
the
only
kind
of
sale
in
which
you
can
treat
it
at
later
receipts
as
an
amount
realized
from
the
original
transaction.
using
sale
in
that
sense,
this
is
no
sale.
now,
i
don't
care
where
you
play
on
the
word
“sale”.
i
don't
want
to
get
into
a
fight
with
the
amici
about
whether
this
should
be
focused
on
the
word
sale
and
the
word
“amount
realized”
or
the
word
“from”.
ultimately
the
distinction
is
the
same
and
that
is
the
question.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
i
hope
so.
the
actual
transaction
is
quite
complicated
and
i
would
like
--
i
will
omit
some
minor
details
that
neither
party
considers
significant.
respondent
clay
brown
was
the
president
and
the
managing
officer
of
a
corporation
engaged
in
lumber
milling.
he,
his
wife
and
his
children
owned
94%
of
the
stock
of
the
corporation,
estate
acquired
on
organization
at
a
total
subscription
of
$30,000.
the
remaining
few
shares
were
owned
by
two
other
officers
of
the
company
who
also
participated.
the
–
in
november
1952,
clay
brown,
who
was
the
spokesman
for
all
of
the
stockholders
and
transaction
was
approached
by
a
representative
of
the
california
institute
for
cancer
research,
the
tax
exempt
charitable
organization.
the
institute
was
interested
in
acquiring
ownership
of
closely
held
businesses
pursuant
to
a
plan
that
had
been
developed
and
widely
utilized
by
another
charity
in
los
angeles,
the
university
hill
foundation
which
is
one
of
the
amici.
and
they
furnished
clay
brown
with
a
brochure,
outlined
in
the
details
of
the
plan
and
the
advantages
to
the
owners
of
the
business
which
is
primarily
tax
exempt.
brown
expressed
interest
and
on
february
4th,
1953,
after
some
months
of
negotiation,
the
transaction
was
consummated.
now,
i
can
best
describe
the
transaction
by
following
through
the
transferors
and
then
tracing
back
what
was
received
in
exchange
from
them.
now,
the
respondents,
the
stockholders
of
the
corporation,
first
transferred
all
of
their
stock
to
the
institute.
the
institute
immediately
liquidated
the
corporation
and
took
over
the
assets.
the
institute
then
leased
the
assets
to
new
operating
company
called
fortuna
sawmills
inc.
fortuna
was
a
new
corporation
that
has
just
been
formed
for
the
purpose
by
clay
brown's
attorneys
and
they
owned
all
its
stock.
the
attorney
is
dead.
they
--
fortuna
then
hired
clay
brown
as
the
general
manager
at
the
same
salary
that
he'd
previously
been
paid
by
the
old
corporation,
took
over
all
of
the
other
operating
personnel
and
continued
the
operation
of
the
business
ithout
interruption.
let
me
repeat
that
very
briefly.
the
respondent,
the
stockholders
transferred
their
stock
to
the
institute.
the
institute
liquidated
the
corporation,
leased
its
asset
to
fortuna
and
fortuna
then
took
over
the
operating
personnel
and
continued
the
business.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i'm
going
to
go
back
to
trace
what
was
received
in
exchange.
i'm
just
following
through
the
assets
to
see
what
happened
to
them
first
and
then
i'll
trace
back
what
goes
back.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
for
present
purposes,
i
am.
i
think
it
would
become
important
primarily
in
whether
fortuna
owes
a
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
further
tax.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
for
purposes
of
this
case
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
you
can
assume
that
that
is
a
lease.
now,
all
of
those
steps
happened
in
a
single
day
and
all
they
were,
were
signing
a
series
of
documents.
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
operation
of
the
business,
nothing
had
happened.
i
--
you
--
it
went
on
as
though
nothing
had
happened.
now,
to
trace
back
what
was
given
in
exchange.
fortuna
agreed
to
pay
to
the
institute
as
rent,
and
i
will
assume
that
it
is
simply
rent,
for
the
use
of
the
assets
80
%
of
the
net
profits
from
the
conduct
of
the
business
before
income
taxes
or
depreciation,
80%
of
the
net
profits
were
to
be
paid
as
rent.
the
institute
in
turn
agreed
to
repay
over
to
the
respondents
90%
of
whatever
amount
were
paid
to
it
by
fortuna.
and
to
continue
paying
those
amounts
to
the
respondents
until
they
had
received
$1,300,000.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
actually,
i
don't
question
the
institute's
taxes
--
exemption.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
government
--
finding
the
shell
under
which
the
peanut
is
in
this
kind
of
transaction
is
not
easy
and
the
commissioner
does
what
you'd
expect
him
to
do.
he
challenges
everything.
now,
i
think
we
have
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
and
--
it's
a
fair
thing
to
do.
it
takes
a
time
before
you
find
out
--
before
you
really
have
figured
out
what
--
the
--
i
would
--
i
would
just
say,
what
the
rat
hole
is.
and
it
took
me
a
long
time
before
i
was
satisfied
about
this
case.
i
thought
for
a
time
that
it
was
really
the
devious
of
the
exemption.
i
don't
think
it
is
devious
of
the
exemption.
i
think
it
is
the
question
here.
that's
real
--
the
real
question
the
transaction
raises.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
if
i
own
a
stock
worth
$10,000
and
i
offer
to
give
it
to
harvard
university
on
condition
that
the
harvard
remit
to
me
the
first
$20,000
of
dividends.
harvard
doesn't
do
a
thing
wrong.
i'm
giving
the
harvard
a
gift
of
a
remote
remainder
interest.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
this
is
not
--
this
is
that
case.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
what
they
did
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
what
they
did
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
what
they'd
--
what
they
did
was
to
convey
the
property
to
the
institute
on
condition
that
the
institute
remit
the
first
one
million
three
of
income.
that's
all
they
did.
they
called
it
a
lot
of
things.
they
called
the
obligation
to
remit
one
million
three
of
--
to
remit
90%
of
the
earnings
up
to
one
million
three.
they
called
that
obligation
a
promissory
note.
they
didn't
call
the
document
a
deed
of
gift.
they
called
it
an
agreement
of
sale.
but
the
only
thing
that
differentiates
this
case
from
my
gift
to
harvard
of
the
remainder
interest
in
stock
after
i
received
so
much
of
the
income
is
to
label
the
parties
used,
that
is
the
only
thing
that
differentiates
this
case.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
but
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
let
me
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
let
me
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
let
me
give
you
an
example
that
doesn't
involve
a
charity.
it
doesn't
involve
a
lease.
you
don't
need
to
have
a
charity
to
work
this
kind
of
transaction.
i
can
do
it
to
my
son
and
at
least
i
will
manage
to
shift
the
income
into
the
lower
tax
bracket.
but
more
than
that,
if
i
have
fully
depreciable
property,
i
don't
need
to
have
a
charity
at
all
and
realize
the
full
tax
benefit
that
respondent
sought
in
this
case.
let's
suppose
that
i
own
a
leasehold
from
--
which
i'd
build
a
building.
now,
i've
leased
the
building
for
the
four
remaining
term
of
the
ground
lease
and
an
annual
net
rent
in
excess
to
the
ground
rent
of
$21,000.
when
the
lease
has
20
years
to
go,
i
purport
to
sell
my
leasehold
interest
to
be
my
son
or
a
stranger
for
$400,000,
he
gives
me
a
note,
it's
called
a
promissory
note.
we
called
an
agreement
of
sale.
he's
to
pay
me
$20,000
a
year
for
20
years
as
the
purchase
price.
however
we
add,
his
liability
is
limited
to
remitting
that
out
of
the
rents
received
from
the
property
and
if
i
don't
get
it,
all
i
can
do
is
give
back
the
leasehold.
now,
let
me
just
point
out
what
happens
if
you
say
that
transaction
is
a
sale.
not
only
are
the
$400,000
that
i
received
over
the
20
years
tax
as
capital
gain
but
be
--
now
has
a
cost
basis
for
the
lease
of
$400,000.
so
the
lease
is
entirely
a
wasting
asset.
he
is
entitled
to
amortize
it.
in
principle,
he
would
have
income
of
$21,000
a
year
from
the
lease.
but
he
has
a
$20,000
offsetting
amortization
deduction
and
in
fact,
his
taxed
only
under
$1000,
i
let
him
keep
as
his
fee.
this
case
doesn't
have
a
thing
to
do
with
abuse
of
charitable
exemptions.
you
can
work
this
transaction
out
with
--
sometimes
as
equal
benefits,
if
you
have
fully
depreciable
property,
with
lesser
benefits
if
it's
an
interfamily
shift
of
income
to
different
brackets.
without
using
charities,
without
using
the
lease
device,
that
is
not
what
the
case
is
about
and
i'm
perfectly
--
had
this
lease
been
a
real
lease
in
which
i'm
pursuing
that
it
is
to
a
wholly
separate
party.
clay
brown
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
management
for
a
fixed
rent.
the
case
to
my
mind
would
be
exactly
the
same
as
this
case.
i
don't
rely
at
all
and
i
don't
think
it
is
important
to
the
issue
in
this
case.
it
would
be
important
as
to
whether
fortuna
can
deduct
the
amount.
it's
not
important
that
this
case
that
this
lease
was
a
rather
strange
document.
i
would
assume
it's
a
straight
lease
under
this
rent.
well,
then
even
after
the
--
i
guess
i'm
still
on
the
facts.
after
the
transaction,
the
business
did
go
on
and
the
amounts
paid
by
fortuna
as
rent
for
the
institute
were
remitted
to
respondents.
during
the
years
1953
to
1956,
they
received
amounts
totaling
$651,000
and
the
question
here
is
the
treatment
of
those
amounts,
if
the
amounts
received
in
the
later
years.
now
in
economic
term,
but
first
i
like
to
analyze
the
transaction
in
economic
terms
without
any
--
necessarily
implying
any
tax
consequences.
the
crucial
thing
about
the
transaction
is
that
the
institutes
neither
pay
nor
risk
a
single
dollar
of
its
own.
it
made
no
down
payment
out
of
its
own
funds.
it
assumed
no
personal
liability
ever
to
make
a
payment
out
of
its
funds.
all
it
agreed
to
do
and
this
is
all
it
agreed
to
do
was
to
remit
to
the
respondent
90%
of
the
income
earned
by
the
lease
of
the
assets
to
fortuna.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
if
i
give
it
to
my
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
let
me
be
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
let
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
alright.
if
he
isn't
--
if
we
loss
this
case,
if
this
transaction
works,
a
corollary
of
it
is
that
the
institute
would
have
--
will
have
--
the
income
would
be
(inaudible).
let
me
say
that
i
wouldn't
--
i
--
i'm
not
tax
exempt.
i
would've
entered
this
transaction
with
clay
brown
and
gave
him
a
note
of
$2
million.
i'm
not
worried
about
someone
trying
to
tax
me
on
the
income.
it
isn't
my
income.
it's
their
income.
all
i've
agreed
to
do
is
remit
it
to
them.
the
problem
--
the
tax
probably
institute
arises
only
after
you
characterize
the
transaction
as
a
sale.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
i
don't
believe
that
is
the
normal
rule.
a
lot
of
people
receive
money
from
the
lease
and
who
were
simply
agents.
it's
not
their
income
and
my
argument
is
that
it
was
not
their
income.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
if
assuming
that
it
was
a
sale,
it
was
their
income.
that's
the
question
you're
answering
when
you
say
it's
a
sale.
if
they
--
you
didn't
have
taxes
and
parties
at
all
and
you
have
these
transaction
between
a
and
b,
the
question
would
be,
“whose
income
is
it,
a
or
b?”
and
that
is
this
case,
that's
the
question
in
this
case,
whose
income
is
it?
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
they
took
some
tax
risks.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
this
court
says
it's
not
a
sale.
it
doesn't
hurt
the
answer
at
all.
it's
only
if
this
court
says
it
is
a
sale,
that
the
institute
has
any
taxes.
it's
only
if
this
court
says
that
it
is
a
sale
that
the
institute
have
any
tax
risks.
if
it
is
not
a
sale,
the
institute
has
simply
accepted
a
gift
of
a
right
to
10
per
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it's
only
their
effort
to
make
this
look
like
a
sale
that
any
tax
risks
are
created
by
the
institute.
they
call
this
a
gift?
no
one
in
the
world
would
have
any
doubt
that
the
institute
didn't
own
the
income
and
none
of
its
earnings
were
being
nearing
to
the
benefit
of
a
private
person.
it's
only
because
they
tried
to
make
it
look
like
a
sale
that
the
institute
ever
has
any
tax
problem.
now,
but
economic
--
let
me
go
back.
economically,
is
to
--
did
not
risk
a
thing.
economically,
as
this
--
the
tax
result
out
of
the
picture
of
the
moment,
they
didn't
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
but
taxes
follow
economic.
economics
don't
follow
taxes.
you
don't
decide
what
a
transaction
is
by
asking
what
is
tax
consequences
will
be
and
then
say,
"is
therefore,
it
has
those
tax
consequences.”
you
start
with
the
economics
and
then
decide
what
the
tax
consequences
are.
and
economically,
the
institute
did
not
put
out
--
did
not
risk
a
single
dollar
of
its
own.
it
agreed
to
do
nothing
more
than
to
remit
90%
of
the
income
from
the
lease
of
the
assets
to
respondents
into
there
--
received
$1,300,000.
its
role
was
entirely
passive.
it
didn't
agree
to
manage
the
business
or
even
contribute
in
any
way
to
produce
any
income.
now
since
the
institute
put
up
nothing.
the
respondents
got
nothing.
they
got
nothing
at
all
from
the
institute.
the
--
now,
all
they
did
economically,
was
to
keep
a
lesser
part
of
what
they
already
have.
before
the
transaction
they
owned
the
business
outright.
they
were
entitled
not
to
90%
to
100%
of
whatever
it
earned.
not
up
to
a
limit
of
$1,300,000
but
without
limit
and
not
just
to
a
possibility
of
recovering
the
assets,
to
keep
the
assets.
they
had
everything
before
the
transaction.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
respondents.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
now
to
be
sure
in
the
transaction,
the
corporation
was
liquidated
and
the
elimination
of
the
corporation
eliminates
the
corporation
income
tax
and
therefore
increases
the
amount
flowing
to
the
respondents.
but
the
respondents
didn't
need
the
institute
to
liquidate
the
corporation.
they
could
have
liquidated
the
corporation
themselves
and
themselves
lease
the
assets
to
fortuna
on
the
same
terms.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
what
the
transaction
is
about.
if
they've
done
that,
if
they've
done
that,
they
would've
gotten
much
more
economically.
they
would
have
a
100%
percent
without
limit.
but
there
would
have
–
there
are
two
serious
tax
consequences.
they
would
be
tax
on
the
liquidation
and
immediate
capital
gains
tax
in
the
year
of
the
liquidation,
measured
by
the
full
value
of
the
assets.
and
in
addition,
not
besides,
in
addition,
all
the
rents
they
thereafter
receive
would
admittedly
be
taxable
as
ordinary
income
less
only
depreciation
deduction.
now,
the
purpose
of
this
transaction
and
the
only
purpose
of
this
transaction
of
respondent's
point
of
view
was
to
avoid
both
of
those
tax
consequences
by
first
transferring
the
stock
to
the
institute
and
having
the
institute
do
the
liquidation.
they
hoped
not
to
be
taxed
themselves
on
the
liquidation
and
in
that
they
have
succeeded.
the
commissioner
did
not
assert
a
tax
on
the
liquidation.
i
happen
to
think
commission
was
wrong.
i
think
it
would
be
quite
plainly
were
taxable
in
the
liquidation
and
should
have
paid
the
capital
gains
tax
in
1953.
but
that
isn't
in
this
case.
we
didn't
assert
it
and
the
respondents,
i
guess,
they
are
not
going
to
assert
it.
the
other
object
is
to
convert
the
later
earnings
remitted
to
them
into
capital
gain
instead
of
ordinary
income
as
they
would
otherwise
have
been.
and
that's
the
issue
of
this
case
is
about.
now,
if
they
are
successful
on
that
by
making
a
gift
and
economically,
all
that
it
is
a
gift
to
the
institute
of
a
remainder
interest
in
the
property
they
will
come
out
ahead
after
taxes
to
be
sure
they
get
nothing
in
the
world
from
the
institute.
they
will
get
something
from
the
united
states
treasurer
which
more
than
pays
them
for
what
they
give
the
institute.
now,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right.
they
did
give
something
away.
i
don't
deny
that
they
gave
something
away.
they
have
less
after
the
transaction
than
they
had
before
it.
if
that's
what
a
gift,
the
remainder
interest
is.
if
i
give
my
son
or
harbor
anyone
else
a
remainder
interest
in
stock,
i
do
have
less
after
the
transaction
i
had
before.
but
i'm
not
getting
anything
from
harbor
to
my
son.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
is
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
is
in
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
think
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
think
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yeah.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
alright.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
if
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
if
i
give
a
remainder
interest
in
stock
or
real
estate
or
anything
else
and
retain
for
my
life
the
right
to
the
income,
the
dividends
in
case
of
stock.
i
think
the
respondents
will
agree
that
the
dividends
i
receive
during
my
lifetime
are
fully
taxable
as
ordinary
income
to
me.
none
of
it
is
capital
gain.
i've
given
away
something
and
i
don't
--
won't
receive
in
perpetuity
but
only
because
if
--
i'd
given
it
away.
actually,
i
think
--
well,
if
i
do
it
for
term
of
years,
the
same
result
follows.
if
i
do
it
for
right
to
the
dividends
until
i
receive
some
specified
amount
how
large
it
may
be.
what
i
receive
is
simply,
i
retrained
the
right
to
the
income
for
a
time
and
given
away
the
remainder.
so,
this
isn't
a
noble
kind
of
transaction.
it
happens
all
the
time.
and
the
fact
that
i've
given
up
ultimate
ownership
in
no
way
determines
the
question
of
whether
what
i
received
in
the
interim
is
income
or
not.
now,
the
--
if
--
economically,
as
i
say,
that
is
--
just
to
get
to
the
remainder,
retention
of
the
interest.
i
haven't
really
meant
to
talk
about
tax
law
on
the
process.
let
me
turn
to
tax
law.
the
statute
is
very
simple,
the
relevant
provisions
of
the
statute.
they're
very
general.
gain
is
gain
from
--
capital
gain
is
gained
from
the
sale
or
exchange
of
a
capital
asset.
gain
is
measured
by
the
amount
realized
from
the
sale
or
exchange.
the
amount
realized
is
this
amount
of
money
received
plus
the
fair
market
value
of
property
other
than
money.
now
to
illustrate
the
application
of
those
provisions
in
very
simple
terms,
i'd
like
several
--
a
few
simple
examples
of
--
let's
take
--
the
gift
of
--
the
transfer
of
--
a
transfers
stock
to
b
on
b's
agreement
to
remit
income
for
his
life.
now
what
--
i
told
you,
everyone
who
agrees
that
isn't,
that's
still
income.
why
isn't
it
capital
gain?
my
transactions
--
a
transfer
of
stock
on
the
transferee's
agreement
to
remit
the
dividends
either
for
life,
for
a
term
or
up
to
stated
amount.
and
i
think
it
is
agreed
that
is
not
--
the
dividends
remitted
will
be
taxable
as
ordinary
inome
and
not
as
capital
gain.
now,
there
are
basically
two
reasons
why
that
isn't
capital
gain.
the
first
is
that
since
my
right
to
income
is
a
right
in
the
very
same
property
i
transferred,
it's
only
a
retained
right.
i
may
have
disposed
the
remainder
but
what
i
have
is
just
a
carved
out
interest
on
the
very
thing
i
had
before
and
it's
not
even
a
taxable
exchange.
i
didn't
receive
it
in
exchange
for
something
else.
i
just
kept
it
and
so
there's
no
sale
or
exchange
in
that
case.
but
the
second
reason
is
much
more
fundamental
and
that
is
what
i
have
is
a
right
to
income.
and
even
if
there
were
a
sale
or
exchange,
what
you
received
under
a
right
to
income
remains
income.
now,
let
me
take
a
case
which
there
is
a
taxable
event
to
demonstrate
that.
suppose
that
i
own
some
general
motors
stock
permit
which
i
bought
for
$20,000
and
it's
now
worth
$30,000
and
i
want
to
dispose
it.
if
i
sold
it
for
$30,000,
i
would
have
$10,000
capital
gain
admitted.
instead
of
selling
it,
i
transfer
it
to
mr.
cox
and
i'd
tell
him
i
don't
want
the
money.
just
create
a
trust
for
me
of
some
ford
stock
that
he
owns
and
give
me
life
interest
in
the
ford
stock.
now,
the
life
insurance
in
ford
stock
is
worth
$30,000,
so
it's
an
equal
exchange.
however,
during
my
life,
ford
does
very
well
and
i
receive
total
distributions
of
a
$100,000
or
$200,000
from
that
trust
(inaudible)
--
interest.
now,
the
fact
--
there
is
a
taxable
exchange.
the
exchange
of
my
general
motor
stock
for
a
life
and
estate
in
ford
stock
is
a
taxable
exchange.
but
the
amount
realized
is
the
value
of
the
interest
i
received,
the
value
of
the
life
estate
and
that
value
is
$30,000.
it
is
only
the
excess
of
that
over
my
basis
of
20
that
is
capital
gain.
so,
i
have
a
capital
gain
to
be
sure
but
only
of
$10,000.
thereafter,
my
--
i
have
a
basis,
my
life
estate
now
is
$30,000
and
i
can
amortize
that
against
my
later
receipts
of
a
$100,000
of
dividends
and
i
would
be
taxed
on
$70,000
net
of
dividends
as
i
received
them.
as
i
--
later,
during
my
lifetime,
i'm
--
suppose
i
receive
a
$100,000
of
dividends
just
distributed
from
the
trust,
dividends
from
the
ford
stock.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
of
course,
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
correct.
except
that
i
can
amortize
my
basis.
so,
if
you
buy
a
life
estate,
you
can
amortize
your
basis
against
the
income.
alright,
so
--
but
my
--
the
point
is
a
very
simple
one,
that
if
you
trade
--
if
you
exchange
a
capital
asset
for
a
right
to
income
even
from
other
property.
the
only
amount
realized
--
the
only
thing
taxed
as
capital
gain
is
the
value
of
the
right
at
the
time
of
the
exchange
not
the
later
yield.
now,
the
only
ex
--
well,
let
me
say
that
that
--
that
i
think
illustrates
the
fundamental
principle
of
capital
gains
taxation,
that
you
hit
capital
gains
only
on
the
values
accrued
up
to
the
time
of
the
disposition.
not
on
the
future
income
yielded
by
the
interest
received
or
retained.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
at
the
moment.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
at
the
moment.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
(voice
overlap)
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it's
not
much
of
a
yield.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
agree
to
pay
it.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
personally
liable
to
pay
it?
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh!
of
course,
that's
a
sale,
but
a
debt.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
where
i
get
the
money
to
pay
it.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
if
i'm
liable
to
pay
it
--
if
i'm
liable
to
pay
it,
what
you
have
is
my
obligation.
now,
what
money
i
use
to
pay
it
with
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
is
my
concern,
not
yours.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
(voice
overlap)
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
makes
no
difference
at
all.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
a
sale.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
but
add
that
you
get
paid
only
if
there
is
income
and
i
have
no
personal
liability
to
pay
you
and
tell
me
the
difference
between
that
and
the
retained
interest
right
to
income.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
can
stop
with
the
hearing.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no
down
payment.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
value
is
a
hundred
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
value
is
a
100,000.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
value
is
a
100,000.
certainly,
i
would
agree
that
the
extra
5,000
which
is
paid
--
that's
rather
like
the
sale
of
the
home
with
no
down
payment
in
which
there's
no
personal
liability.
to
start
out
with,
no
one
pays
anything
but
the
home
buyer
monthly
begins
to
pay
for
it
out
of
his
own
pocket
and
i
think
that's
probably
enough
to
make
it
a
sale.
in
your
case
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
in
your
case,
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
the
problem
we
have
arises
really
on
only
when
the
thing
transferred
its
income-producing
property
and
the
right
to
be
paid
is
limited.
the
right
is
limited.
i
don't
care
what
--
where
in
fact
it
come
from
to
be
paid
out
of
the
income.
once
you
add
the
element
that
the
buyer
is
putting
up
something
of
his
own,
out
of
his
own
pocket,
we
have
a
very
different
case.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right.
you
--
you're
case,
i
find
it
a
very
tough
one.
whether
--
whether
the
--
i
could
ask
there's
no
sale
initially
when
he
makes
the
first
$5000
payment.
he's
now
got
something
in
it
and
that
is
a
sale.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
don't
think
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
for
the
ultimate
liability,
is
not
greater?
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
the
only
basis
i'm
taking
is
that
if
you
get
nothing
at
all
from
the
transferee,
if
everything
you're
ever
entitled
to
get
is
depended
on
what
income
that
property
produces
without
any
contribution
being
made
by
the
transferee,
all
you
have
is
a
right
to
the
future
income.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
don't
think
anybody
--
i
don't
think
anybody
in
the
law
of
sales
would
call
this
a
sale
if
it
were
labeled
a
deed
of
gift
and
the
tax
law
doesn't
care
what
labels
the
parties
use.
i
do
that
--
the
same
transaction
occur
--
occurs
all
the
time
and
its
called
a
gift
and
the
law
of
sale
doesn't
come
a
long
and
say
it's
a
sale.
and
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
with
no
down
payment,
with
the
buyer
furnishing
no
management,
no
contribution
to
make
the
asset
more
productive
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
but
usually
the
payments
would
come
out
of
the
buyer's
pocket.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
--
come
only
out
of
income
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
and
the
buyer
is
not
--
is
not
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
and
no
personal
contribution
to
produce
in
the
income
and
nothing
is
to
come
out
of
the
buyer's
pocket.
if
--
there
are
lot
of
cases,
there
a
lot
of
gifts.
the
--
i
don't
believe
there
are
a
lot
of
those
cases.
it
can't
occur.
why
should
i
give
you
my
--
unless
i'm
undoubtedly
motivated,
or
i
have
some
tax
advantage
for
my
making
a
gift.
why
should
i
give
you
my
property
for
nothing
from
you
except
an
agreement
to
give
me
back
some
of
the
income
it
produces?
i
was
entitled
to
all
of
the
income
to
begin
with.
the
transaction
makes
no
sense
except
as
a
gift
and
that
is
what
it
is.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
but
these
are
my
payments
coming
out
of
their
pockets.
but
then
in
the
case
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
no,
obliga
--
alright.
i
agree
with
you.
i
agree
with
you
that
--
let's
just
take
the
typical
home,
a
sale
of
a
home
with
no
down
payment.
actually,
i
don't
think
those
are
very
typical,
i'll
use
it
as
guarantee
or
something,
but
assume
that's
a
sale
of
a
house
with
no
down
payment
at
all.
i
think
that
ought
to
be
accounted
for
is
a
sale.
now
granted,
there
was
no
immediate
down
payment
but
the
buyer
makes
one
heck
of
a
commitment.
in
fact,
the
buyer
--
first
off
all,
he
moves
in
and
he
didn't
plan
to
move
out
next
month
and
he's
going
to
start
paying
monthly.
and
once
he
starts
paying,
he's
got
a
stake,
a
stake
out
of
his
pocket,
out
of
his
own
pocket.
now,
that
is
not
in
the
case
i
thought
you
were
posing.
if
that's
the
case
you're
talking
about,
i
withdraw
what
i
said.
but
the
case
i
thought
you
were
posing
is
one
in
which
you
transfer
income-producing
property
and
the
obligation
is
limited
to
remitting
the
income.
and
that
transaction
just
doesn't
make
any
sense
except
as
a
gift
and
it
is
a
gift.
the
essence
--
the
essential
difference
between
a
right
to
income
and
a
right
in
a
debt
and
this
is
a
distinction
that
arises
all
the
time
in
the
tax
laws
is
whether
there
is
a
cushion
for
there's
somebody
else
that's
assuming
the
primary
risk
and
the
transferor
has
some
(inaudible)
from
the
future
risk,
something
that
gives
him
at
least
some
additional
assurance
of
payment.
if
he
gets
--
if
the
transferor
puts
up
nothing
of
his
own,
assumes
no
risk,
has
nothing
to
loss,
the
transferee.
the
transferor
has
received
nothing.
he
continues
to
bear
all
the
risks
and
it's
--
he's
the
only
loser.
he
is
the
only
loser
if
the
income
falls
off
or
the
value
goes
down.
yes,
he
couldn't
lose
anything
in
this
transaction.
only
the
respondents
could.
they're
entirely
dependent
on
income
and
that
i
say
is
better
right
to
income.
now,
i
don't
know
how
you
would
ever
draw
the
line
otherwise.
this
transaction,
the
price
is
one
million
three.
why
not
two
million,
four
million,
ten
million?
there
is
no
--
nothing
in
the
economics
to
prevent
ths
price
from
being
$10
million.
i
can
transfer
stock
and
retain
the
right
to
the
dividends
in
perpetuity
and
in
effect
simply
by
making
the
note
big
enough
and
living
in
the
liability
to
remit
in
the
dividends.
well,
if
anyone
of
you
has
a
share
of
general
motor
stock,
i
will
buy
it
for
a
million
dollars
on
these
terms.
there's
nothing
in
the
economics
for
the
gift
of
the
remainder
and
i
would
--
i
at
least
who
accept
the
gift,
however,
remote
it
is.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
start
by
dealing
with
the
question
about
the
findings
of
value
of
which
much
has
been
made.
i
don't
think
they're
relevant
but
i
would
like
to
answer
what
is
said
about
them.
justice
goldberg,
i
think
is
quite
right
in
pointing
out
that
the
finding
--
quoted
didn't
say
that
the
property
was
worth
one
million
three.
that
was
the
result
of
real
negotiating
and
within
reasonable
range
in
the
light
of
the
earnings
as
in
the
net
worth
corporation.
but
what
was
not
quoted
was
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
let
me
first
say
what
else
they
found
then
i
would
suggest
how
you
reconcile
what
they
did
find.
the
government
in
the
tax
court
makes
two
arguments.
the
first
was
since
in
the
argument
we
make
here
that
there's
no
shift
to
risk
and
it
was
not
a
sale
at
all.
the
second
argument
--
well,
let
me
give
the
tax
court's
answer
to
that
argument.
in
entering
that
argument,
the
tax
court
opinion
at
page
62
of
the
record,
they're
answering
that
--
at
this
point,
they're
answering
argument
that
i
make
in
here
basically.
they
say,
“it
may
be
as
respondent
contends
that
petitioner
would
have
been
unable
to
sell
the
stock
at
as
favorable
a
price
to
anyone
other
than
a
tax
exempt
organization.”
well,
it's
on
top
of
the
page
and
they
--skipping
down
on
several
sentences,
they
say
that
however
that
the
right
of
a
taxpayer
by
legal
means
to
increase
the
amount
received
by
--
from
a
different
transaction
rather
than
some
other
transaction
is
fundamental
and
that
a
substantive
sale
in
substance
is
not
to
be
ignored
solely
because
the
exempt
organization
is
willing
to
pay
a
somewhat
higher
price
than
someone
else
might
pay.
i
may
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
likewise
especially
acknowledged
that
the
price
was
probably
higher
than
it
would
have
been
in
any
other
kind
of
transaction.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
they
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
they
do
not
find
--
they
--
this
rejects
any
finding
i
think
that
the
price
was
or
--
i'm
--
(inaudible)
he's
having
calling
the
price.
the
limit
of
one
million
three
on
the
amount
that
they
were
to
receive
happened
to
be
just
equal
to
the
amount
they
could
have
sold
the
property
for
--
anybody
else
on
secured
terms.
the
tax
court
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
wait
--
at
this
point,
the
tax
--
we
--
when
we
argued,
it
was
more
than
they
could
have
gotten.
we
contend
that
there's
more
than
they
could've
gotten
in
any
other
kind
of
sale,
(inaudible)
of
that
maybe
so.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
alright.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
alright.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
alright.
and
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
they
never
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
they
never
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
sorry.
i'm
so
sorry.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
they
never
retracted
that
assumption.
the
government
also
made
a
second
argument.
the
second
argument
that
the
–
the
second
argument
the
government
made
was
in
fact
the
transaction
was
a
sham.
it
was
never
expected
that
the
property
could
pay
itself
out
and
it
was
known
all
along
that
it
would
collapse
as
it
all
ultimately
did.
it
was
a
sham
in
that
sense.
in
answering
that
argument,
they
finished
the
first
argument.
in
answering
that
argument,
the
tax
court
said,
“no,
it
was
a
bona
fide
deal.”
the
institute
really
expected
to
end
up
owning
the
properties.
and
then
it
said,
“supporting
that
finding,
the
findings
--
they
hadn't
reasonable
expectations
that
it
would
pay
out
as
a
supporting
fact
to
that.”
they
say,
“the
price
of
one
million
three
was
the
result
of
real
negotiating,
it
was
within
a
reasonable
range
in
the
light
of
the
earnings
history
and
the
net
worth.”
and
to
me
all
that
says
is
that
there
was
a
very
good
likelihood
that
it
would
pay
out.
there
was
no
--
this
--
and
this
is
why
they
said
it,
to
support
their
finding
that
it
was
not
a
sham.
there
was
a
bona
fide
expectation
of
a
pay
out.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
i
do
not
think
it
is
crucial.
let
me
address
myself
to
that.
let's
suppose
that
i
--
a
father
conveys
stock
to
his
son.
the
stock
is
selling
in
the
market
at
a
thousand
dollars.
he
conveys
it
to
his
son
on
a
condition
that
the
son
remits
the
first
thousand
dollars
dividends
to
him.
is
that
a
sale?
the
amount
to
be
remitted
happens
to
coincide
with
the
value
of
the
property.
i
say
it
is
not
a
sale.
it
is
all
it
is
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
a
retention
of
the
right
income
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
smith
and
mr.
jones
wouldn't
do
it.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
can
keep
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
can
keep
it
as
a
stock.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
would
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
alright.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
if
you
take
the
risk,
you
give
me
the
money
and
you
gamble
on
what
dividends
it
produces.
if
you
want
me
to
take
the
gamble
to
see
whether
it
does
produce
that
much
income,
i
want
all
of
it.
i
don't
want
just
a
thousand
dollars.
i
want
everything
it
ever
produces.
why
should
i
give
you
anything?
the
only
reason
i
transfer
the
stock
to
you
for
a
thousand
dollars
in
a
normal
transaction
is
you
take
over
the
burdens
of
ownership.
the
risk
that
maybe
the
company
will
go
bankrupt.
i'm
sorry
i
used
general
motors
as
an
example.
not
all
stock
is
general
motors'
stock.
a
lot
of
stocks
is
very
speculative
stock.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
--
well,
i
didn't
offer
to
give
it.
i
offer
to
accept
any.
so,
it
doesn't
depend
on
how
much
i'm
ultimately
going
to
receive.
it
depends
upon
the
nature
of
my
right
to
it.
if
i
gotten
out
and
shifted
to
you
the
burdens
of
ownership,
the
economic
incidents
of
ownership,
the
risk
that
it
won't
produced
a
thousand
dollars
of
income,
if
i
get
all
the
risk,
all
of
them
as
in
this
case,
i'm
entitled
to
everything
and
all
i've
done
is
give
away
is
to
make
a
gift
of
a
remainder
interest.
and
whether
the
amount
of
income
i
retain
is
if
the
stock
is
worth
a
hundred
dollars,
if
i
reach
a
thousand
dollars,
if
all
--
whether
i
retain
the
right
of
the
first
500,
the
first
thousand,
the
first
2000
or
the
first
million,
the
transaction
is
the
same.
the
only
time
you
have
a
sale
is
when
the
purchaser
puts
up
something.
the
purchaser
makes
a
commitment
and
relieves
of
total
dependence
on
what
the
asset

--
mr.

it
is
absolutely
crucial
that
there
was
no
down
payment.
no
undertaking
to
do
anything
else.
no
undertaking
ever
to
pay
anything.
no
contribution
to
the
management
of
the
business,
nothing.
that
is
what's
crucial
to
my
case
that
the
institute
furnished
nothing
at
all.
now,
justice
white
mentioned
the
case
which
the
buyer
is
going
to
operate
the
business.
the
sale
to
--
the
key
employee,
they
say.
the
manager
dies,
his
widow
is
left
with
the
business
and
she
wants
to
sell
it
to
the
key
employees,
only
guy
who
knows
run
it
and
for
years,
didn't
have
any
money.
so,
the
key
employee
creates
a
corporation
and
gives
notes
and
he
runs
the
business
and
tries
to
make
a
go
of
it.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
no,
no,
no,
no.
not
at
the
ins
--
the
institute
isn't
doing
anything.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
important
thing
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
i
don't
say
that
would
be
the
result.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
--
in
that
case,
the
purported
buyer,
the
ones
who
is
purportedly
making
a
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
a
note.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
institute
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
the
institute
isn't.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
we
made
a
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
we
made
the
prior
arrangement
that
the
transferor
and
he
should
agree
on
who
--
to
whom
it
would
be
leased.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
that's
a
question,
who
this
--
contract
it
is?
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
this
is
--
signed
the
paper
but
it
was
part
of
the
original
transaction,
i
take
it.
the
transferor
could
have
at
least
to
the
same
outfit
could
run
the
business.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
it
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
if
--
look
--
if
i'm
the
key
employee
and
you
sell
business
to
me,
the
widow
of
the
owner
or
something.
when
i
agree
to
take
over
the
business
and
give
you
notes
for
it
and
subordinate
my
rights
to
the
payment
of
your
notes,
i
invest
a
very
great
deal
in
running
that
business
in
the
hope
of
making
it
pay
out
and
ending
up
with
something.
that
is
a
very
significant
change
in
the
relationship
of
the
parties.
now,
whether
that
change
is
enough
to
make
it
a
sale,
it's
not
something
that
i
need
to
answer.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
have
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
greater
the
risk
the
less
likely
it
is
to
be
debt
and
if
there
is
absolutely
no
shifting
of
risks
and
the
transferee
furnishes
nothing,
it
is
not
a
sale.
all
it
is,
is
a
gift
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
let
me
see.
i
have
difficulty
with
that
case.
i
don't
want
to
argue
that
it
is
a
sale.
all
i
want
to
do
is
acknowledge
the
difference
of
the
transactions.
that
in
that
case
would
--
that
key
employee
could
leave
and
go
some
place
else.
he
decides
to
commit
himself
to
running
this
business
in
trying
to
make
it
pay
out
for
the
widow
and
then
he'll
end
up
owning
it.
he
does
have
a
stake.
he
puts
something
into
it
and
if
it
fall
--
if
it
collapses
after
a
year
or
so,
he's
out
a
great
deal.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
depends
what
this
court
decides.
the
--
most
of
the
--
what
mr.
kinsey
refers
to
as
a
standard
plan,
if
it
is
indeed
the
way
he
describes
it,
it's
exactly
the
same
thing
that
happens
without
a
charity.
and
you
can
accomplish
the
same
result
by
--
through
depreciation.
so
that
kind
of
transaction
could
very
well
occur
and
he
said
it
does
occur.
my
answer
to
him
is
that
the
plan
he
describes
of
the
--
is
exactly
--
produces
exactly
the
same
results
as
this
one.
i
don't
think
anything
turns
in
the
fact
that
the
institute
was
tax
exempt.
with
depreciable
property,
you
can
accomplish
is
ultimately
the
same
results
without
a
tax
exempt
into
it.
however,
you
can
use
a
lost
corporation.
you
can
use
a
nonresident
alien.
they're
all
kinds
of
ways
to
provide
tax
shelters
for
income.
the
important
thing
is
the
tax
law,
tax
income
to
the
persons
who
economically
benefits
from
it.
and
once
you
separate
the
tax
from
the
benefit
of
the
income,
any
good
lawyer
can
find
a
way
to
exploit
it.
it
is
essential
that
tax
consequences
follow
economics.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
let
me
say
first
of
all
that
if
a
transferee
furnishes
something,
there's
always
a
question
whether
what
it
furnishes
is
enough
to
make
a
real
cushion
--
make
a
real
change
in
the
nature
of
the
position.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
in
which
the
--
well,
in
his
brief,
he
doesn't
really
tie
it
down
to
a
case
in
which
the
buyers
do
operate
the
business.
he
just
--
their
case
he
talks
about
in
the
brief
to
create
the
very
--
the
case
he
talks
about
in
the
brief
is
the
case
we
talk
about
in
our
petition
for
certiorari.
you
create
a
corporation
with
no
money
at
all
and
then
somebody
else
owns
than
you.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
then
you
transfer
your
stock
for
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
case
is
nothing
more
--
it
is
nothing
more
than
a
gift
with
a
retain
right
to
income.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
things
that
are
called
notes
are
not
notes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
exactly,
exactly.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
--
first
factually,
i
would
like
to
clarify
something.
the
interest
imputation
provision,
it
was
adopted,
this
is
a
1964
act.
the
interest
imputation
provision,
it
were
adopted.
it
was
a
much
broader
problem.
even
though
you
have
two
debts
given
in
exchange
for
installment
the
court
somehow
has
been
reluctant
to
impute
interest.
i
never
quite
understood
why
not.
we
never
really
thought
of
this
as
far
as
i
can
tell.
that's
--
and
it's
a
problem
that
cuts
across
the
board.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
particularly
with
this
kind
of
transaction.
it
was
not
an
alternative
solution
to
this
problem.
that
problem
is
up
around
all
the
time
and
every
installment
sale
interest
ought
to
be
imputed
even
those
through
sale
and
to
through
debt.
congress
did
that.
the
other
proposal
was
to
deal
with
this
problem.
now,
an
awful
lot
of
proposals
were
made
in
the
1964
act
that
weren't
enacted.
we
kept
cutting
down
the
program.
the
committee
approved
only
a
very
limited
member
of
proposals.
i
think
the
failure
to
ever
--
to
even
get
this
out
of
committee
doesn't
--
it
proves
very
little
about
tax
legislations.
if
we
lose
this
case,
we'll
be
--
go
back
and
we'll
try
again.
to
get
into
legislation
isn't
just
a
matter
of
saying
this
is
right
therefore
you
must
give
it
to
us.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
that
would
--
that
we
would
certainly
have
to
try,
i
suppose.
it's
a
very
hard
problem
to
solve
by
the
legislation
by
the
way.
they
tried
to
solve
it
the
1950
act
but
they
picked
on
the
wrong
things.
they
thought
it
was
abuse
of
the
charity
exemption.
they
taxed
unrelated
business
income,
the
--
and
various
other
provisions.
and
of
course,
taxpayers
found
a
way
around
it.
that's
what
happens
when
you
try
to
deal
with
a
basic
fundamental
question
of
principle
by
particularized
legislation.
it
generally
doesn't
work,
if
--
they
may
take
you
years
of
it,
amending
the
statute
again
and
again,
really
to
cover
the
problem.
and
as
to
the
secretary's
reference
to
the
existing
law
is
quite
right
that
under
the
existing
decision,
people
were
getting
away
with
it,
there
are
a
bit
--
about
a
dozen
of
cases
involving
exactly
this
transaction
and
the
patent
cases
in
isolated
areas.
it's
quite
right
when
he
says
under
existing
law
in
that
sense,
this
is
happening
and
at
the
same
time
he
said
that
by
--
we
were
litigating
this
case.
i
--
the
government
didn't
take
his
position
was
wrong
when
the
secretary
(inaudible)
was
trying
to
get
a
legislative
solution.
that
happens
all
the
time.
and
they
say,
the
problem
is
a
--
when
the
--
a
very
broad
importance
and
i
do
think
it
is
of
crucial
importance
that
the
decisions
have
tax
consequences
follow
the
true
economics
of
the
case.
thank
you
sirs.
