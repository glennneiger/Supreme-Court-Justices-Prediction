mr.
william
h.
kinsey
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
back
in
1953
in
behalf
of
our
firm,
i
wrote
an
opinion
that
told
mr.
brown
that
he
was
entitled
to
capital
gain
if
he
went
into
this
transaction.
today,
i
would
not
write
an
opinion
saying
that
the
tax
consequences
flowed
in
the
manner
that
mr.
barnett
has
stated
in
some
of
the
illustrations
he
used.
but
i
won't
show
the
flaws
in
them
because
i'm
not
sure
that
the
--
particularly
pertinent,
i'd
rather
proceed
with
the
case.
it
is
true
that
a
transaction
of
this
type
is
subject
to
abuse.
it
is
also
true
that
the
standard
of
the
plan
for
a
corporate
buyout
that
i
outlined
in
my
brief,
where
a
person
forms
a
thinly
capitalized
corporation
and
buys
the
stock
of
another
corporation
liquidates
it
in
that
that
too
is
subject
to
abuse.
in
either
case,
the
purchaser
could
assume
the
role
of
a
complete
patsy
and
say,
"since
i'm
risking
nothing.
since
there's
no
skin
off
my
nose,
i
don't
care
what
the
purchase
price
is.
the
agreements
i
have
here
have
the
price
left
blank,
you
fill
it
in.
you
just
see
that
i
get
something
as
we
go
along
such
as
10%
or
a
little
salary
and
i
won't
care".
such
a
situation,
such
a
sale
would
be
bad
and
it
would
not
be
entitled
to
capital
gain.
now,
the
factors
that
make
it
subject
to
abuse
are
the
lack
of
down
payment,
the
lack
of
personal
liability
or
the
lack
a
commitment
of
independent
assets
but
whatever
the
fact
that
it
may
be
subject
to
abuse
does
not
mean
that
every
case
where
you
have
these
lacks
is
abused.
also,
this
transaction
does
not
fit
in
with
may
be
which
we
would
call
the
traditional
or
standard
mold
of
commercial
transaction.
however,
the
capital
gain
provision
does
not
say
sale
or
exchange.
in
ordinary
commercial
transactions,
it
says,
“sales
or
exchanges”.
in
the
definition
of
a
capital
asset,
it
excludes
from
the
definition
property
held
for
sale
to
customers
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business.
but
that's
an
exclusion
in
defining
sale.
there's
nothing
that
says
that
it
has
to
be
a
sale
in
an
ordinary
commercial
transaction.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
yes,
because
if
you
wrote
in
a
sales
price
where
it
was
necessary
run
the
asset
to
extinction
to
pay
the
price
you
have
converted
future
income
into
capital
gain.
our
whole
thesis
is
based
that
to
distinguish
the
good
from
the
bad
there
has
to
be
a
reasonable
relationship
between
the
values
of
the
property
at
the
time
a
conversion
at
the
time
of
a
sale
and
the
amount
that
you
have
received
for
it.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
that
is
the
crucial
issue.
that's
and
another
one
what
i
refer
to
is
no
strings.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
no
strings.
in
other
words,
you
don't
have
the
right
to
get
the
property
back.
the
only
strings
is
a
security
device
that's
reasonable
under
the
circumstances
and
where
you're
dependent
upon
the
future
income
from
the
property
and
management.
a
management
contract
is
part
of
the
reasonable
security
device.
but
it
can
extend
beyond
payment
of
the
full
purchase
price.
in
other
words
as
i
paraphrase
it
shortly,
if
the
price
is
right
and
no
strings,
all
possible
questions
are
answered
so
far
as
capital
gain
prerequisites
are
concerned
despite
the
fact
that
there's
no
down
payment,
no
personal
liability
or
no
injection
or
commitment
of
independent
assets.
that
was
the
position
that
we
took
in
the
tax
court.
that
was
our
theme.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
i
don't
think
that
the
use
of
–-
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
i
don't
think
we
did
get
this
higher
price
than
we
would
under
the
standard
deal
because
i
think
the
standard
deal
would
have
given
just
as
much
as
the
institute
deal
did.
that
was
the
point
i
was
making
in
the
brief
in
comparing
the
results
of
how
this
would
have
work
if
you
handled
that
under
the
standard
deal.
and
maybe
i
should
get
to
show
how
the
standard
deal
works
in
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
we
had
a
little
bit
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
we
had
$00.72
as
contrast
to
the
$00.70,
the
first
or
$00.65
composite
--
but
that
was
over
the
short
period
of
time.
at
the
end,
you
still
had
depreciation
left.
in
other
words,
that
was
over
the
five-year
period.
you
hadn't
used
up
all
your
depreciation.
it
just
gave
you
the
cash
flow
quicker.
it
didn't
give
you
anymore
cash
flow.
in
other
words,
under
the
basic
tax
axiom
that
every
purchaser
receives
a
tax
basis
in
the
amount
that
he
pays
for
the
property
that
he
is
entitled
to
recoup
at
some
time
in
some
way
tax
free.
all
he
has
to
do
is
coordinate
that
recoupment
with
this
payment
upon
the
purchase
price
and
he
is
entitled
to
receive
tax
fee
everything
he
pays
on
the
purchase
price
but
as
a
matter
of
timing.
the
difference
was
only
one
of
timing
as
i
see
it
between
the
standard
transaction
and
the
institute
transaction.
under
the
standard
transaction,
the
purchaser
would
receive
a
basis
that
would
entitle
him
to
recoup
tax
free
the
full
$1,300,000
that
he
paid.
and
even
in
this
particular
transaction
that's
particularly
conducive
of
that
because
most
of
the
assets
were
depreciable
or
depletable
assets.
you
didn't
have
much
value
in
land
where
you
have
a
considerable
value
in
land
or
an
undepreciable
asset.
it's
a
little
more
difficult
to
get
the
same
results
under
the
standard
transaction.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
because
the
institute
came
to
clay
brown
and
by
the
time
we
were
submitted
with
the
transaction,
it
was
pretty
well
gelled.
i
actually
explained
to
mr.
brown
how
you
could
get
this
about
the
same
results
under
the
(inaudible)
--
standard
transaction
but
i
just
pointed
it
out.
we
didn't
go
out
and
shop
it.
if
that's
--
happen
to
us
when
we
have
represented
people,
i
don't
like
to
steal
a
deal
when
somebody
else
has
it
all
gelled.
but
that
was
pointed
out
that
he
could
do
it
through
the
standard
transaction.
that's
why
we
felt
fairly
confident
in
telling
him
that
he
could
get
capital
gain
if
--
because
gut
wise
nothing
more
was
happening
here
than
you
could
do
under
a
standard
transaction
there
would
have
been
through
several
times
that
had
been
passed
with
no
questions
asked.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
now
of
course,
nothing
in
the
law
requires
a
down
payment.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
installment
section,
section
453
was
amended
to
expressly
exclude
the
necessity
for
a
down
payment
in
the
year
of
the
sale.
you
are
entitled
to
report
under
the
installment
method
if
you
receive
nothing
in
the
year
of
sale.
also,
under
most
state
laws
deficiency
judgments
are
forbidden.
so,
certainly
there's
nothing
in
the
law
that
prevents
a
combining
of
the
two
no
down
payment
and
no
personal
liability
so
as
not
repugnant
to
the
law.
i
think
that
all
that
we
can
say
where
we
have
a
lack
of
these
elements
that
is
the
down
payment
and
commitment
of
assets
that
the
transaction
is
subject
to
additional
scrutiny
because
you
don't
have
the
interplay
of
economic
forces
that
you
would
have
if
you
did
have
a
down
payment
or
a
commitment
of
other
assets.
but
if
it
survives
that
scrutiny,
then
the
mere
fact
that
it
might
have
been
abused
but
wasn't
abused
doesn't
disvalue
--
disqualify
it
for
capital
gain.
now,
what
scrutiny
did
this
transaction
obtained?
i'd
like
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
tax
court
trial.
this
wasn't
a
case
that
got
through
the
local
office
in
portland
without
the
government
being
aware
of
its
significance.
they
were
aware
that
this
was
the
first
case,
the
forerunner
case.
we
purposely
wanted
to
be
the
first
case
because
i
didn't
know
when
i
wrote
the
opinion
back
in
1953
that
this
was
a
widely
publicized
tax
avoidance
scheme.
so,
law
review
articles
hadn't
been
written
in,
that
revenue
ruling
hadn't
been
issued
at
that
time.
so,
we
had
taken
a
couple
of
features
out
that
were
present
in
it,
one
being,
the
institute's
invitation
that
mr.
brown
own
49%
of
the
lessee
company.
we
couldn't
see
how
that
had
any
relationship
to
just
a
security
device.
also,
that
you
--
they
said
you
can
have
a
management
contract,
an
employment
contract
until
you're
ready
to
retire.
we
couldn't
see
how
that
had
anything
to
do
with
the
security
device.
so
mr.
brown
did
not
own
anything
in
the
lessee
corporation
and
his
management
contract
is
extended
only
until
the
purchase
price
was
paid.
now,
i'm
not
sure
that
those
two
will
make
it
bad
if
it's
otherwise
good.
it's
just,
we
didn't
want
to
come
through
(inaudible)
--
mudded
waters.
and
also,
our
price
was
right
and
we
got
the
inference,
maybe
it
was
the
wrong
inference
because
all
of
the
cases
decided
since
then
have
been
favorable
to
the
taxpayers
that
perhaps
there
is
a
backlog
of
cases
where
they
have
unrealistic
purchase
prices.
well,
ours
wasn't
and
we
were
willing
to
subject
it
to
the
scrutiny
of
the
tax
court
and
we
did
and
as
i
say,
our
tom
tom
there
was
the
price
is
right
and
no
strings.
so
maybe
it
is
a
little
bit
of
an
offbeat
transaction
but
still
we're
entitled
to
capital
gain
because
there's
nothing
that
says
that
the
purchaser
has
to
contribute
something
to
a
deal
for
capital
gain.
it's
what
the
seller
gives
up.
and
if
the
price
is
right
and
you
give
up
all
ownership
and
the
assets
when
that
price
has
been
paid,
you
have
converted
your
capital
investment
pure
and
simple.
and
you
should
be
entitled
to
capital
gain
for
what
you
received
despite
the
fact
that
the
source
of
the
payment
are
the
income
earned,
is
the
income
earned
by
the
assets
transferred
and
any
proceeds
from
the
sale
are
up
by
virtue
of
the
mortgage
that
you
have
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
absolutely.
in
fact
my
--
there
are
very
explicit
findings.
i
have
summarized
them
somewhat
in
the
brief
and
i'm
quoting
now
from
what
the
tax
court
said.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
yes.
i'll
give
the
record
page,
it
jumps
around.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
it's
on
page
12
of
my
brief
where
the
extracts
are
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
--
where
it
says,
“the
price
was
the
result
of
real
(inaudible)
--
real
negotiating.
the
final
agreed
price
was
arrived
at
in
an
arms
length
transaction.
the
price
was
within
a
reasonable
range
in
the
light
of
the
earnings
history
of
the
corporation
and
the
adjusted
net
worth
of
the
corporate
assets".
petitioners
by
the
transaction
here
involved
parted
with
their
equitable
ownership
of
the
assets
when
they
transferred
their
stock
to
the
institute
and
became
the
creditors
of
the
institute
with
the
mortgages
and
the
management
contract
to
security
for
payment
of
the
purchase
price
in
the
stock.
now,
then
this
next
one
i
think
is
important
because
it
goes
to
the
validity
and
the
impact
of
the
negotiation.
the
primary
motivation
of
the
institute
was
the
prospect
of
earning
up
the
assets
free
and
clear
after
the
purchase
price
had
been
fully
paid
which
would
permit
the
institute
to
convert
the
property
into
money
for
use
in
cancer
research.
now,
it
could
have
been
content
with
just
10%.
it
could
have
taken
the
patsy
approach
but
it
didn't.
it's
(inaudible)
as
i
believe
it
was
expressed
in
the
testimony.
it's
(inaudible)
was
ending
up
with
the
assets
free
and
clear.
therefore,
every
dollar
it
knocked
down
in
the
purchase
price,
90
cents
of
those
dollars
were
extra
dollars
that
it
would
get
that
it
otherwise
wouldn't
get
if
it
didn't
knock
the
price
down
and
there
was
real
negotiation.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
well,
clay
brown,
weren't
happy
with
the
price
and
i'm
sure
the
institute
didn't
seem
happy
so
i
guess
that's
the
way
it
should
be
with
neither
side
as
happy
with
the
price,
you
finally
got
a
good
one.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
pardon?
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
well,
not
in
the
traditional
mode.
i
would
--
i
would
not
say
--
i'd
say
yes,
it's
a
commercial
transaction
because
they
had
a
motivation
for
negotiating
a
lower
price.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
in
a
sense,
yes.
there
was
another
reason
why
the
purchase
price
--
another
governor
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
purchase
price
and
that's
the
--
in
order
to
have
this
not
beyond
related
income,
the
lease
cannot
extend
for
more
than
five
years
so
as
stated
in
the
brochure
that
mr.
barnett
referred
to.
it
says,
“we
only
want
companies
where
we
can
show
that
the
purchase
price
can
be
paid
in
five
years”.
well,
if
you
can
pay
the
purchase
price
in
five
years,
you
can't
pay
a
very
exorbitant
price
for
that
business.
that's
anything
they
can
pay
off
in
five
years,
that's
an
automated
governor
on
the
amount
of
the
purchase
price.
you
can't
go
sky
high
in
a
situation
like
that.
now
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
well,
with
our
thesis
of
the
price,
it
was
right
and
there
were
no
strings,
the
sellers
got
no
benefit
that
they
could
have
gotten
by
selling
it
to
a
non-charitable
institution.
yes,
the
institution
does
benefit
and
but
the
true
benefit
has
not
yet
happened
yet.
i
mean,
the
true
beauty
of
this
from
the
charity
hasn't
--
didn't
come
into
play.
ordinarily,
a
person
who
bought
a
business
and
used
cash
flow
to
pay
the
purchase
price,
used
up
all
its
depreciation
then
when
he
sell
it,
he's
going
to
have
a
big
capital
gain,
the
charity
wouldn't.
in
other
words,
that
that
the
true
beauty
of
the
charitable
exemption
isn't
even
involved
here.
that
would
come
into
play
when
it
subsequently
sold
the
assets.
it
didn't
have
to
pay
anything
on
the
gain
and
would
have
a
hundred
cents
out
of
every
dollar
for
which
it
sold.
now
at
the
trial,
and
the
reason
i
think
this
is
important
is
because
mr.
barnett
asked
a
lot
of
questions
and
raises
a
lot
of
inferences,
many
in
which
could
well
be
--
well,
been
asked
at
the
trial.
we
presented
all
of
the
principal
parties
as
our
witnesses
although
there
was
a
big
--
a
stipulation.
it
would
have
been
sufficient
in
themselves
and
our
purpose
of
doing
it
was
to
tender
them
for
cross-examination.
so
if
they
had
any
questions
they
could
ask
them.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
relating
something
about
the
tax
court
trial
with
the
thought
in
the
mind
that
this
would
be
of
interest
to
negate
some
of
the
inferences
that
may
have
been
raised
by
mr.
barnett's
brief
in
his
oral
argument
that
our
approach
there
is
the
same
here
that
if
the
price
is
right
and
there
are
no
strings,
we're
entitled
to
capital
gain
treatment.
the
commissioner's
main
contention
at
--
in
the
tax
court
was
that
there
was
a
secret
understanding,
a
tacit
agreement
that
the
institute
was
never
really
to
end
up
with
the
assets
but
that
clay
brown
could
get
them
back
anytime
he
wanted
so
he
could
generate
this
capital
gain
and
also
not
have
to
give
up
the
assets
and
the
institute
would
get
its
10%
so
it
would
be
happy
with
that.
of
course,
we
recognize
that
they
were
correct
in
that
statement,
that
we
were
entitled
to
capital
gain.
that
was
quite
a
potent
accusation
they
made
which
meant
that
we
put
everything
on
the
record.
that's
why
the
record
was
so
complete.
now
on
appeal,
i
get
a
little
bit
of
the
inference
that
because
the
record
is
so
voluminous,
therefore,
it
must
have
been
kind
of
an
offbeat
transaction.
and
the
reason
the
record
was
so
voluminous
is
because
of
that
contention
made
by
the
commissioner
at
the
tax
court
trial.
the
tax
court
held
against
that
contention
and
the
commissioner
abandoned
it
on
appeal.
the
commissioner
also
contended
that
clay
brown
retained
too
much
control
over
the
assets.
there
wasn't
much
contention
that
the
purchase
was
too
high.
that
was
an
attack.
there
wasn't
any
statement
saying,
“well,
no
one
on
the
right
mind
would
make
this
sale.
you
must
have
had
an
unusually
high
purchase
price
because
the
witnesses
were
there".
they
could
have
asked
them
that
question.
we
put
on
clay
brown
and
we
put
on
bill
booth
who
was
his
treasurer
who
took
care
of
that
compiling
the
figures
and
showing
the
earning
at
the
record
and
so
forth.
mr.
(inaudible)
who
formed
--
fortuna,
was
there.
we
tendered
them
all
on
cross-examination
so
they
could
have
the
omplete
leeway
of
cross-examination
to
ask
any
questions
they
wanted.
also,
the
institute,
i
mean
the
commissioner
subpoenaed
and
brought
up
for
los
angeles
the
president
of
the
institute,
mr.
(inaudible)
and
mr.
seagrave
who
negotiated
the
transaction.
however,
the
commissioner
did
not
call
them
and
would
not
have
called
them.
i
had
to
call
them
as
our
witness
so
they
had
them
on
cross-examination
to
ask
whatever
questions
they
want.
the
commissioner
in
the
tax
court
called
only
one
witness
and
that
one
witness
was
me
and
they
asked
me
just
a
couple
of
questions,
my
name,
whether
i
specialize
in
tax
planning,
and
that
was
about
all.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
what
--
the
way
they
arrived
at
the
price
was
they
took
the
earnings
record.
they
based
some
on
the
earnings
record.
the
average
earnings
were
about
350,000
a
year.
another
thing,
they
reconstructed
the
balance
sheet.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
they
took
the
book
balance
sheet
and
substituted
--
appraised
the
values
for
the
book
values
and
came
out
to
a
figure
that
was
about
a
million
one
then
they
justified
the
difference
between
the
million
one
and
the
million
three
by
the
earnings
record
of
the
company.
it
was
a
combination
of
the
two.
the
original
asking
price
was
i
think
about
a
million
six.
it's
a
little
confusing
because
there
are
a
$125,000
of
promissory
notes
in
there
and
in
some
of
the
negotiations
they
were
talking
about
the
purchase
price
exclusive
of
the
notes.
in
another
negotiation
they
were
talking
about
the
purchase
price
including
the
notes.
but
the
$1,300,000
included
the
notes
so
the
purchase
price
of
the
stock
exclusive
of
the
notes
would
be
a
$1,175,000.
whenever
i
say
the
purchase
price
for
the
stock,
i
mean
the
stock
in
the
notes.
i'm
just
using
the
short
term
“stock”
in
this
argument.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
then
i
think
you
get
into
the
koki
situation.
that
was
where
there
was
a
high
purchase
price
and
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
the
seller
was
back
in
possession
of
the
assets.
if
you
have
the
purchase
price
very
high
plus
some
mortgage,
and
it's
a
foregone
conclusion,
you're
going
to
default,
you're
really
have
the
strength
if
you
really
given
up
the
asset.the
way
the
circuit
court
expressed
it
you
have
a
closed
circuit.
if
the
purchase
price
is
high
coupled
with
the
security
device,
there's
little
likelihood
that
the
purchaser
will
end
up
for
the
assets.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
yes,
but
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
well
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
well,
in
ours
and
i
think
in
the
once
that
follow
this
pattern.
there
are
--
the
default
if
a
specified
amount
and
not
have
been
paid
over
a
two
year
period
and
a
note
became
payable
in
all
events
in
10
years.
in
other
words,
it
just
didn't
go
on
forever.
and
also,
i
think
we're
being
may
be
somewhat
liberal.
at
least,
we're
not
taking
an
extreme
position
when
we
say
that
a
reasonable
price
is
necessary
to
get
the
capital
gain.
maybe
we
should
better
express
it
by
saying
if
the
price
is
right.
then
there's
no
question
about
qualification
for
capital
gain.
but
it
kind
it
goes
with
the
concept
of
conversion
of
capital
investment
which
is
the
phrase
used
by
this
court
that
your
capital
investment
is
the
value
of
the
assets
at
the
time
of
the
conversion.
so,
if
the
purchase
price
way
exceeds
the
value
at
the
time
of
conversion.
don't
you
have
proceeds
from
something
other
than
the
conversion
of
capital
investment?
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
that
is
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
that's
correct.
the
quicker
you
can
get
paid
out,
the
last
risk
there
is.
now
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
well,
taxes
weren't
mentioned
because
they
just
agreed
to
pay
a
certain
percentage
because
they're
not
subject
to
tax.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
that's
a
good
question.
on
the
amici
brief,
uses
that
as
a
reason
for
--
may
be
there's
some
consideration
there
that
if
that
they
would
have
to
pay
the
taxes
out
of
their
own
funds.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
well,
yes.
i
think
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
yes.
but
even
then,
i
think
in
this
case,
there
wouldn't
be
a
much
taxable
income
because
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
--
they'd
be
entitled
to
the
depreciation.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
correct.
and
here,
the
property
was
condemned
and
it
was
all
gone
over
a
seven
year
period
and
they
get
to
recoup
their
whole
basis
over
that
seven-year
period
so
they
get
to
deduct
the
million
three.
the
only
question
it
would
be
whether
they
carry
back
and
carry
forward
provisions
would
even
it
all
out
or
whether
some
operating
loss
might
go
down
the
drain
but
even
if
their
not
tax
exempt.
there
would
be
very
little
tax
is
payable
by
the
institute.
so
whether
they
are
tax
exempt
or
not,
i
don't
think
it's
much
concern
to
anybody.
and
also,
just
because
there's
a
sale,
it
doesn't
follow
that
the
institute
is
taxed
on
the
rental.
true
that
mr.
barnett
says
that
if
we
lose
the
case,
they
aren't
even
going
to
press
the
issue
with
the
institute.
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
if
we
win
the
case
and
they
press
it
that
the
government
will
win.
i
don't
think
they
will.
and
even
if
they
did
it
doesn't
mean
that
they're
--
that
they
are
entitled
to
their
depreciation
because
of
course,
they
would
be.
but
now,
may
be
to
pursue
that
point
a
little
further,
to
understand
why
someone
might
want
to
sell
on
one
of
these
bootstrap
situations,
it's
necessary
to
understand
the
position
of
the
owner
of
a
closely
held
corporation.
he
can't
take
his
earnings
out
in
the
form
of
dividends
because
the
tax
cost
is
rather
prohibited.
his
tax
of
52%
in
the
corporation
and
say,
if
he's
in
the
50%
bracket,
that's
50
cents
coming
out.
and
what
he
looks
that
is
the
dollar
earned
by
the
underlying
assets.
what
do
i
have
left
over
for
a
dollar
for
the
underlying
assets?
it's
not
the
situation
like
that
mr.
barnett's
suppositions
where
you're
owning
stock
in
a
publicly
held
corporation
where
your
only
source
of
income
were
dividends.
i
mean,
that's
a
completely
different
world.
that's
the
main
difference
between
mr.
barnett
and
myself
that
we're
talking
in
different
economic
worlds.
he
puts
the
transaction
against
one
native
habitat
and
i
do
against
another
and
the
transaction
is
(inaudible)
--
completely
different.
and
i
think
he
might
illustrate
the
difference
in
our
world
but
mr.
barnett
would
ask
with
rising
inflection
in
his
voice,
“do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
a
purchaser
will
pay
for
a
business
out
of
the
very
earnings
of
the
business
that
you're
buying?”
and
my
reaction
to
that
is,
how
else?
how
else
do
you
buy
a
business?
in
our
world
that's
the
norm.
that's
the
way
businesses
are
bought.
now
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
correct.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
he
could.
he
would
do
that.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
and
in
that
aspect
of
the
case
was
the
main
one
they
gave
me
pause
when
i
rendered
the
opinion
that
he
is
entitled
to
capital
gain.
and
that
one
has
not
been
raised
by
the
government
either
in
the
tax
court,
in
the
circuit
court
or
here
up
till
now.
and
the
way
i
answered
that
was
--
well,
that
they
did
in
the
circuit
court.
they
said
that
the
control
was
so
great
that
they
could've
forced
the
default
by
maybe
mismanagement
or
doing
this
and
that.
but
as
we
pointed
out,
it
would
be
a
breach
of
the
agreement.
and
also,
i
think
they
couldn't
purposely
throw
the
ball
game.
i
think
they
had
a
fiduciary
duty
to
run
the
business
so
that
there'd
be
a
payoff.
but
the
main
way
i
answered
that
which
i
recognized
as
being
the
most
difficult
point
in
the
whole
thing
was
to
analogize
it
to
other
situations
where
capital
gain
is
realized,
particularly
in
a
section
1239
situation,
where
a
person
owns
depreciable
property
and
he
sells
it
to
a
corporation
in
which
he
owns
80%
of
the
stock.
there,
capital
gain
is
expressly
condoned
by
the
statute.
i
can
sell
to
may
own
corporation.
i
own
80%
of
the
stock.
i
can
take
capital
gain,
the
corporation
gets
the
depreciation.
i
control
the
board
of
directors,
i'm
president
and
capital
gain
is
allowed.
so
at
that
background,
i
couldn't
see
why
the
fact
that
clay
brown
also
managed
the
assets,
the
profits
of
which
were
used
to
pay
as
purchase
price
was
the
thing
that
would
disqualify
this
for
a
capital
gain.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
that
is
correct.
but,
they
certainly
could
cancel
the
lease
if
they
figured
that
he
was
guilty
of
mismanagement
or
there
was
anything
peculiar
going
on.
and
also,
i
think
it
was
to
his
self-interest.
he
wouldn't
have
gone
into
the
deal
in
the
first
place.
it's
one
of
those
situations
where
it's
got
to
be
good
for
all
parties.
and
i
think
it
was
his
self-interest
to
get
paid
out.
and
as
you'll
note
from
the
record
that
the
institute
did
do
checking
on
him
through
the
bankers
and
they
got
a
good
reference
on
his
character
and
integrity.
so
i
think
that
possibility
was
contemplated.
but
the
mere
fact
that
he
might
breach
the
agreement
and
do
something
that
i
think
we
would
even
say
unethical
that
you
don't
take
that
into
consideration
in
determining
the
tax
consequences
particularly
when
you
say,
“well,
i
can
sell
them
my
own
corporation;
80%
owned”.
and
there,
i
even
have
the
assets.
i
mean,
it
isn't
a
--
here,
they're
all
gone
when
the
purchase
price
is
paid.
there,
i
still
have
them
in
my
corporation,
at
least
80%
of
the
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
no.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
we
said
their
price
was
reasonable,
yes.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
no,
that
the
tax
court
said
that,
the
institute
might
have
paid
more
than
the
ordinary
purchaser
in
a
different
transaction.
but
i
don't
know
what
the
tax
court
--
but
they
said
the
price
was
within
a
reasonable
range
and
as
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
they
never
did,
no.
or
at
least
never
were
they
said
there
was
this
much
more
and
if
i
don't
even
think
they
said
anymore.
of
course,
they're
lot
of
inference
that
they
didn't
agree
with
anything.
but
they
never
came
right
out
and
say
we
think
this
price
is
too
high
or
that
the
evil
in
this
thing
is
an
exorbitant
price.
but
we
just
knew
it
was
important
so
we
put
in
all
of
that.
it
wasn't
to
counter
an
argument
of
theirs.
it
was
to
make
our
record
because
we
had
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
absolutely.
they
can
refinance
anytime
they
wanted.
and
if
they
gotten
near
the
end
and
they
make
it
carry
default
and
i
imagine
there's
an
equity
or
redemption.
and
so
that
they
could
protect
themselves
there
was
nothing
that
prohibited
them
from
using
other
funds
if
they
wanted.
now
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
yes.
and
that's
exactly
what
it
would
have
done
of
course
because
if
it
had
a
--
been
commercially
feasible
for
--
to
do
it.
it
wouldn't
let
a
default,
just
a
technical
default
go
by
if
the
business
were
worth
something
and
it
could
salvage
it
by
getting
outside
funds.
while
it
might
not
be
able
to
use
funds
it
could
get
for
cancer
research
still
it
had
quite
a
potent
management
committee
that
passed
upon
this
transaction.
i
think
between
and
they
could
have
seen
that
it
was
refinanced.
their
funds
were
procured
in
order
to
preclude
any
default.
now,
i
think
maybe
a
good
test
to
see
whether
anyone
in
their
right
mind
would
enter
into
a
(inaudible)
--
transaction
like
this
would
be
--
to
look
an
example
of
a
transaction
given
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
before
the
house
ways
and
means
committee,
when
he
was
attempting
to
have
the
law
changed
to
adopt
just
about
the
thesis
that
mr.
barnett
is
expounding
before
this
court.
that
example
is
on
page
44
and
45
of
my
brief.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
that
was
in
1963.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
and
this
example
is
captures.
if
you're
going
to
capture
in
a
law
school
type
essay
question,
you
couldn't
better
capture
our
situation
and
the
standard
plan
too
say
across
breeding
of
it
too.
you
couldn't
better
capture
it
than
you
do
in
example
1
right
here.
there
isn't
any
down
payment
of
--
from
independent
funds.
it
seems
obvious
they're
using
funds
from
the
company
purchased.
the
purchase
price
is
payable
only
out
of
75%
of
the
corporation's
net
profits.
and
i'm
sure
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
here
wasn't
just
giving
to
congress
an
example
of
an
idiotic
situation
no
in
their
right
mind
would
enter
into.
i
think
he
was
giving
a
very
real
situation
and
you'll
notice
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
said
that
under
present
law,
capital
gain
treatment
would
be
accorded.
he
didn't
say
capital
gain
treatment
might
be
accorded.
he
said
it
would
be
accorded.
his
only
qualification
was
whether
you
get
your
basis
recovery
right
of
or
whether
you
have
to
take
your
basis
recovery
pro
rata.
and
that
is
an
important
part
they
made
in
the
brief
that
i
won't
to
elaborate
on
too
much
in
argument
that
that
plus,
section
4
of
the
interest
imputation
section,
section
483
that
the
commissioner
went
out
to
capitol
hill
and
try
to
get
congress
to
adopt
this
view
point.
congress
knowingly
said,
“no,
we
don't
want
it.”
but
they
didn't
leave
at
all
tax
as
ordinary
income.
they
said
we're
going
to
impute
interest
because
we
didn't
have
interest
in
our
--
the
$1,300,000
was
payable
without
interest
and
one
of
the
alternative
contentions
made
by
the
commissioner
was
that
you
have
an
interest
factor
in
there.
the
tax
court
held
against
them
on
that
and
the
commissioner
abandoned
that
upon
appeal.
and
as
we
have
stated
in
our
brief,
if
it
takes
an
act
of
congress
to
reverse
an
alternative
contention
of
the
commissioner,
why
should
they
take
an
act
of
congress
to
do
as
main
contention,
particularly
when
its
main
contention
is
set
forth
in
a
question
in
an
example
presented
to
congress
where
he
says
unequivocally,
you
get
capital
gain
in
a
situation
like
that.
also,
i
cite
that
example
for
the
proposition
that
situations
like
this
are
normal
that
people
do
enter
into
them.
otherwise,
the
secretary
of
the
treasurer
wouldn't
have
given
this
example
and
i'm
certainly
sure
that
you
don't
presuppose
in
this
example
that
the
purchase
price
was
adjust
purchased
price
from
$350,000
was
an
exorbitant
price.
i
think
it's
a
reasonable
price.
but
i
think
we
can
see
from
this
example
why
a
purchaser
adds
something
and
contribute
something
to
the
deal
even
though
there's
no
injection
on
new
capital,
no
down
payment
or
no
personal
liability
and
that's
because
of
the
increased
cash
flow.
because
all
we
have
to
do
in
this
example
is
superimpose
a
few
facts
and
i
think
it
comes
out
fairly
clear.
it
says
that
m
--
that
s
had
a
basis
of
75,000
for
a
stock.
that
means,
they
only
paid
75,000
into
the
corporation.
so,
the
corporation
made
profits
and
bought
machinery
but
let's
say
that
it's
also
depreciated
its
machinery.
let's
say
its
machinery
has
depreciated
down
to
$50,000.
now,
the
purchaser
who
comes
along
and
pays
$350,000
for
that
business
gets
added
depreciation
of
$300,000,
added
depreciation
of
$300,000
at
a
50%
rate
is
a
$150,000.
a
$150,000
of
additional
cash
flow,
of
additional
available
dollars
that
a
purchasing
company
gets
irrespective
and
independent
from
any
initial
injection
of
capital
or
any
personal
liability.
actually,
a
person
who
is
selling
a
small
corporation
has
to
sell
on
the
deferred
payment
basis
because
there
aren't
too
many
people
around
with
that
much
cash
and
if
they
have
that
much
cash,
they
don't
want
to
put
it
on
one
deal
so
selling
on
the
deferred
payment
basis
is
the
norm.
so
the
question
is,
how
much
beefing
up
can
you
get.
in
every
purchaser
likes
to
get
away
with
this
little
as
possible,
he
likes
to
commit
as
little
of
its
assets
as
possible.
and
usually
the
reason
that
you
want
some
beefing
up
is
not
so
much
that
that
is
going
to
give
you
a
cushion
because
how
much
--
cause
if
things
go
bad
even
if
$50,000
cushion
isn't
really
going
to
be
adequate.
the
main
reason
for
the
cushion
is
to
make
the
purchaser
hurdle
a
little
so
that
he's
sure
that
he
gives
it
a
college
try.
but
here,
we
didn't
have
to
have
that
because
clay
brown
was
managing
it
and
he
knew
it
would
be
given
a
college
try
because
he
was
the
one
expending
the
effort.
but
that's
what
makes
these
things
go
under
the
standard
plan
that
you
get
this
additional
cash
flow
by
virtue
of
this
depreciation.
but
may
be
that's
a
bygone
era
and
that's
another
thing
and
i
think
the
commissioner
is
already
won
the
day
but
not
in
this
court
but
by
statute.
because
under
section
1245
that
adds
back
your
depreciation.
any
depreciation
taken
since
january
1,
1962
is
taxed
as
ordinary
income.
so,
if
you
got
to
step
up
to
$300,000
from
depreciation
i
mention
and
all
that
depreciation
were
taken
since
january
1,
1962
it
would
be
taxed
as
ordinary
income.
all
the
beauty
is
gone
from
the
transaction
and
you
probably
wouldn't
do
it
that
way.
so,
this
maybe
is
a
passing
era,
this
of
the
standard
plan.
but
it
wasn't
a
bygone
era
at
the
time
this
transaction
was
entered
into
it.
and
all
that
this
formula
with
the
institute
was
simply
a
different
means
of
generating
cash
flow.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
the
1245?
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
well,
that's
only
prospective.
that
that's
of
--
that's
the
trouble
here
you
see.
we
don't
mind
stuff
that's
prospective.
it's
when
you
go
in
the
deal
and
then
it's
done.
anything
that's
prospective
is
alright.
i
recognize
as
taken
some
of
the
beauty
out
of
this
deals
but
in
other
words
he
changed
the
ground
rules.
when
you
know
the
ground
rules
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
it
was
both.
and
it
only
implied
to
deals
made
after
a
specified
date
and
only
applies
to
depreciation
taken
subsequent
to
january
1,
1962.
in
other
words,
you
work
hard
in
it
unknowingly.
there
was
plenty
of
advanced
notice.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
pardon?
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
no,
that
was
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
well,
1245
is
that
the
appreciation
recapture.
the
interest
imputation
one
is
483,
that's
prospective
too
and
the
prospective
ones
are
alright.
it's
this
retroactive
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
--
that
hurts.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
is
prospective
as
to
new
deals
and
also
as
to
depreciation.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
yes,
on
new
deals.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
yes,
correct.
so,
that
is
part
of
our
thesis
that
congress
is
aware
of
this
bootstrap
sale
situation.
they
know
what's
going
on
and
they're
aware
of
all
its
facets
and
they've
taken
care
of
it.
they've
changed
the
ground
rule.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
that
--
well,
no,
this
also
stops
deals
with
the
institute
because
the
1245
pick
up
--
applies
upon
the
liquidation
of
the
corporation,
the
tax
exemption
that
the
institute
were
not
affected.
it's
a
bygone
era
for
institute
deals
as
well
as
the
stamp
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
well,
because
of
section
1245
picks
up
the
depreciation
on
--
not
just
to
sale
but
any
disposition
with
certain
exceptions
that
don't
apply
the
liquidating
distributions
to
any
disposition
of
depreciable
equipment.
its
tax
to
the
distributing
corporation
like
when
clay
brown
was
liquidated
into
the
institute,
clay
brown
is
the
distributing
corporation.
its
not
tax
exempt,
you
see.
so
the
institute's
exemption
does
not
immunize
the
1245
pick
up.
so
i
--
as
i
say,
the
danger
in
any
--
well,
actually
i
thinking
it
was
good.
it
gives
(inaudible).
it
helps
deals
be
made
my
philosophy
of
taxation.
but
congress
has
spoken
so
we
have
to
play
with
the
ground
rules
as
they
are
but
they
apply.
if
the
standard
plan
approach
is
dead,
the
institute
--
formula
approach
is
just
as
dead
because
this
hit
just
as
hard
as
is
this
standard
plan.
so,
whenever
they
do
that
section
1245
in
the
impute
interest
and
not
only
that
but
commissioner
goes
to
capitol
hill
and
gives
a
hypothetical
like
this
which
adopts
--
practically
what
mr.
barnett
was
saying
and
congress
says,
"no".
i
think
you
have
a
pretty
good
expression
of
congressional
intent.
and
now
under
law
and
mr.
barnett's
argument,
actually
i
go
along
with
them
a
surprisingly
long
way
in
the
law
and
it
might
be
some
help
if
i
indicated
how
far
along
i
go
with
him,
and
then
see
where
we
part.
and
then
maybe
where
we
part
maybe
some
indication
of
who's
right.
when
you're
dealing
with
taxation,
i
like
to
start
with
the
code
provisions.
and
there
is
one
spot
in
mr.
barnett's
brief
where
he
mentions
the
code
provisions,
both
in
the
same
paragraph
which
is
the
only
place
that
he
mentions
on
both
on
the
same
paragraph.
and
that's
on
page
15
and
16
at
his
brief
where
he
says,
“if
in
a
realizing
event,
a
transferor
receives
a
right
to
income
in
exchange
for
a
couple
assets
the
only
amount
realized
from
the
exchange
itself
and
hence
the
amount
taxed
as
well
as
capital
gain
is
the
value
of
the
right
to
the
income.
the
income
may
after
produced
by
that
right
remains
fully
taxable.
capital
gain
is
from
the
sale
or
exchange
of
a
capital
asset".
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
that's
on
page
15
and
16
of
into
reply
brief.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
and
then
it
says,
since
the
right
to
future
income
is
property
it
is
only
the
fair
market
value
of
the
right
received
the
enters
into
the
computation
of
capital
gain.
i
can
go
along
with
that.
i
don't
have
to
quarrel
with
that
statement.
and
it
isn't
just
taken
out
of
contents
because
he
ends
up
his
brief
with
the
same
thing.
his
reply
brief,
where
he
says
the
only
thing
entitled
to
capital
gain
treatment
is
the
appreciation
in
value
of
the
capital
asset
prior
to
the
disposition.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
that's
on
page
37,
right
down
near
the
bottom.
we
agree
with
that.
we're
not
ascribing
any
other
attributes
to
the
capital
gain
provisions.
when
what
is
received
may
exchange
for
a
capital
asset
is
its
self
right
to
income.
the
only
possible
way
in
which
the
gain
can
be
separated
from
the
future
income
is
by
valuing
the
right
to
the
future
payment
and
treating
its
value
as
the
amount
realized.
well,
applying
that
to
the
facts
of
our
situation,
the
realizing
event
was
the
transfer
of
the
clay
brown
and
company
stock
to
the
institute
in
return
for
the
right
to
receive
a
million
three.
now
that
million
three
was
represented
by
a
note,
but
the
note
was
non-negotiable
and
incorporated
the
agreement
by
reference.
so
i
don't
have
ascribe
any
particular
significance,
the
factors,
i
know
it.
i'm
willing
to
say,
it
was
just
a
contractual
right
to
receive
a
million
three.
so,
alright,
we'll
let
our
capital
gain
be
determined
by
the
value
of
that
right
on
february
4,
1953.
what
was
the
value
of
that
right?
we
think
it
was
a
million
three
or
it
was
the
same
as
the
value
of
the
stock.
and
all
he
has
done
is
taking
the
reverse
side
or
back
door
approach
to
point
one
of
our
initial
thesis
that
your
only
entitled
to
capital
gain
in
the
extent
that
the
stock
was
worth
a
million
three
on
february
4,
1953.
it's
the
same
criteria
go
into
determining
what's
the
value
of
the
right
to
receive
the
million
three
as
go
into
the
determining
what's
the
value
of
the
stock.
it's
the
earning
record
of
the
company.
it's
the
underlying
assets,
because
there
was
a
mortgage
on
it.
so
i
think
we
have
a
merge
plot
if
the
stock
was
worth
a
million
three,
the
right
to
receive
a
million
three
was
worth
a
million
three.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
yes,
but
the
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
the
fact
that
you
don't
discount
the
reason
--
alternative
contention
and
they
lost
that
and
they
abandoned
that
and
that's
what
section
483
remedies.
so,
i
think
that
is
kind
of
a
side.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
yes,
that's
correct.
but
i
think
actually
you
can
find
a
value
easier
in
the
right
to
receive
the
million
three
than
you
can
in
valuing
the
stock
because
here,
there
is
a
finding
that
the
commissioner
agreed
to
because
its
i
meant
to
mention
in
discussing
what
the
tax
court
said
that
the
commissioner
excepts
in
the
circuit
court
all
of
the
basic
findings
of
the
tax
court.
one
of
those
findings
was
that
the
institute
expect
it.
and
i
think
the
institute
would
include
clay
brown
because
he
furnished
the
figures
expected
that
the
purchase
price
would
be
paid
in
five
years.
the
note
wasn't
due
till
--
for
10
years.
so,
he
had
a
100%
leeway
there
reduced
between
5
years
and
10
years
to
expect
to
be
in
--
paid
in
5
years
be
pretty
hard
to
say
that
a
note
secured
by
this
underlying
assets
and
so
forth
was
worth
anything
less
than
a
million
three.
so,
let
our
capital
gain
be
determined
by
the
million
three.
but
then
where
we
part
company
is
--
i'm
not
sure
we
part
the
company,
it's
how
then
he
gets
the
receipts
on
a
tax
as
ordinary
income
because
under
the
installment
method,
you're
entitled
to
report
on
the
installment
method.
and
the
installment
provision
does
not
apply
just
to
sales
even
if
these
weren't
a
sale
it
applies
to
sales
in
any
other
dispositions.
the
installment
method
does
not
require
any
indebtedness.
all
it
requires
is
the
right
to
receive
income.
the
only
mention
of
indebtedness
is
it
says,
“you
can't
receive
more
than
30%
of
the
purchase
price
during
the
year
sale
and
in
determining
the
30%
you
exclude
evidences
of
indebtedness
of
the
purchaser.”
but
evidence
of
indebtedness
of
the
purchaser
are
only
something
you
exclude
to
keep
from
getting
knocked
out
of
the
coverage
of
the
provision,
it's
not
that
we
requisite
for
coming
under
it.
so
if
we
have
a
--
the
right
to
receive
the
million
three,
is
worth
a
million
three
in
february
4,
1953
we
don't
have
to
take
it
into
income
and
figure
out
some
way
to
get
it
back
through
amortization
or
depreciation.
we
rely
on
the
installment
provision
or
even
if
you
didn't
have
to
get
it
back,
you
could
amortize
it.
because
if
i
paid
a
million
three
for
a
non-negotiable
promissory
note
for
a
million
three,
i
certainly
would
get
to
set
off
my
purchase
price
for
it
as
i
received
it.
now,
he
tries
to
relate
it
back
got,
you
got
to
get
it
related
to
the
underlying
assets
some
weight
but
that
isn't
necessary
at
all.
in
other
words,
you
can
go
right
down
with
them
on
the
approach.
i
think
our
approach
is
better.
i
think
in
the
front
door,
a
conversion
of
capital
investment,
what
was
the
stock
worth
at
the
time
is
a
little
more
better
approach
than
taking
the
other
end
of
it
that
the
--what
was
the
right
to
income
that
you
receive,
what
was
that
worth?
but
either
way,
you
end
up
on
the
same
spot
and
the
only
place
he
goes
astray
--
and
i
think
what
he
says
is,
“you
not
only
got
to
take
the
million
three
in
as
capital
gain
but
also
you
should
receive
payments
on
the
million
three.
you
got
to
take
that
in
as
ordinary
income
where
there's
just
no
foundation
for
that
in
the
tax
flow
whatsoever".
then
say,
"even
if
it
wasn't
for
the
installment
sale
provision,
you
have
the
equivalent
of
cash
doctrine
for
a
cash
basis
taxpayer
which
these
were
and
while
the
right
to
receive
the
million
three
maybe
worth
a
million
three
for
determining
capital
gain
purposes
it's
not
for
the
purpose
of
reporting
income
because
it's
been
established
that
if
you
have
the
obligation
to
general
motors
to
receive
a
million
three,
a
cash
basis
taxpayer
doesn't
have
to
take
all
of
that
in.
he
just
takes
it
as
he
receives
it.
he
only
has
to
take
it
all
in
if
he
receives
the
equivalent
of
cash
such
as
a
promissory
note.
but
as
i
say
we
don't
have
to
rely
on
that
doctrine
because
we
did
elect
the
installment
method.
the
tax
court
found
we
elected
the
installment
method
and
that
was
one
of
the
basic
findings
that
the
commissioner
accepted.
so
we
can
even
go
right
down
with
them
in
the
law.
and
also,
on
some
of
the
illustrations
that
the
he
used
at
the
end
of
the
brief
where
he
supposes
of
the
--
some
tax
abused
--
going
on
and
this
are
the
ones
he
use
in
oral
argument
about
the
general
motor
stock
or
the
ford
stock.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
well
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
i
really
don't
understand
it.
in
the
first
place,
i
don't
see
there's
any
evil
because
if
you're
only
going
to
--
you
could
sell
the
general
motor
stock
right
now.
and
--
well,
let's
say
i
don't
know
what
their
yield
in
general
motors
is
but
the
dow
jones
yield
say
is
3%.
at
3%
it
take
you
3
and
1/2
years
to
get
back
which
you
--
he
gets
tomorrow
by
going
out
and
selling
it
on
the
market.
so,
were
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
--
where
you
get
capital
gains.
so
were
--
where's
there
any
big
tax
bonanza
for
that,
you
see.
in
other
words,
he
raises
the
boogieman
and
i
don't
think
it
has
any
scaring
quality.
i
don't
see
how
you
gain
anything
by
it.
the
second
example
about
the
lease
were
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
no,
i
don't
contend.
no
i
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
no.
you
don't
have
to
meet
that.
all
you
do
is
to
depend
on
this
life
expectancy.
you
get
into
a
private
annuity
situation.
in
other
words,
it'd
be
the
value
of
the
general
motor
stock
and
the
right
to
receive
income
for
specified
years.
you'd
project
what
that
greater
return
ones
against
the
life
--
its
expectancy
and
if
that
equal
the
then
value
of
the
stock,
you'd
be
entitled
to
your
capital
gain
to
the
extent
that
it
exceeded
at
it
something
else
from
capital
gain.
but
the
--
there
is
any
tax,
the
evil
or
tax
danger
there.
and
also
if
you
sell
stock
they
answer
one
question,
it
was
brought
up.
and
your
obligation
to
pay
for
this
stock
is
payable
only
out
of
the
dividends
from
the
stock
or
the
proceeds
from
the
stock
with
no
personal
liability,
with
no
down
payment.
i
say
that's
capital
gain,
provided
the
price
was
the
value
of
the
stock
at
the
time
of
the
transfer
and
i
think
anybody
agree,
but
you
see,
he
gazes
it
up
a
little
with
the
suppositions
that
the
price
is
way
higher.
you're
going
to
get
this
--
all
this
extra
stuff
coming
in.
i
don't
say
that.
but
now
one
thing
i'd
like
it
--
to
differentiate
because
the
impact
of
this
case
go
beyond
this.
everything
i've
been
saying
applies
to
a
fixed
price.
we
have
a
situation
where
you
have
an
open
enterprise
such
as
--
the
patents
cases,
where
your
purchase
price
isn't
a
fixed
amount.
it's
a
percentage.
but
it's
not
a
hundred
percentage.
with
the
fixed
price,
you
devote
a
100%
of
the
income
towards
payment
or
as
much
as
you
can
and
still
not
keep
--
maintain
the
assets.
but
where
you
have
an
open
price,
you
don't
take
100%.
you
take
a
smaller
percent
such
as
5%.
but
there,
the
principle
still
applies,
the
value
--
the
consideration
is
equal
of
the
value
at
the
time.
the
problem
is
that
you
can't
value
the
time.
how
do
you
value
a
patent
like
--
as
this
court
has
said
of,
“a
patent
is
a
flash
of
genius.”
how
do
you
value
a
flash
of
genius?
you
can't.
so
what
you
have
to
do
is
use
an
(inaudible),
get
formula
approach
and
say
its
worth
5%
of
the
gross
sales,
price
sale,
whatever
it
manufacturer
and
under
it.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
i
don't
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
yes.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
no.
in
another
part
of
the
opinion
it
says
that
the
price
was
within
a
reasonable
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
well
--
yes.
and
i
think
what
they
meant
by
reasonable
range
is
something
along
the
line
what
mr.
barnett
meant
when
you're
valuing
a
closely
held
corporation
who's
to
say
what
the
value
is?
it
applies
what
percentage
of
return
you
(inaudible)
--
you
apply.
it's
a
very
difficult
thing.
so,
i'm
not
saying
its
worth
exactly
a
million
three.
it
isn't
any
exact
science,
no
one
can
value
that.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
if
he
were
valuing
it
that
is
the
commissioner
for
a
state
tax
purpose
because
you're
going
to
rest
assure
it
would
come
out
a
lot
more
than
a
million
three.
and
as
long
--
if
that's
the
case
i
don't
think
that
theirs
any
undue
tax
benefit
here
that
the
taxpayer
is
getting
when
the
price
was
right.
when
i
say
right,
i
mean
when
in
a
reasonable
range
and
there
were
no
strings
when
that
price
is
paid
off
his
all
through
irrespective
of
the
fact
that
it
was
only
payable
out
of
the
income
in
the
assets
sold.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
it
had
to
–
been
a
percentage
of
profits?
then
i
wouldn't
have
been
that
higher
percentage.
it
had
to
be
a
lower
percent
because
you
have
to
leave
something
over
for
the
purchaser
too.
now
--
then
it
would
be
a
question
of
what
percentage
like
50%
of
the
profit
and
that's
a
good
question.
i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer
like
that
and
i've
never
had
a
client
that
wanted
to
find
out
bad
enough
to
try
that.
but
i
think
it
would
be
good,
i
think
it
could
be
good.
like
you
say,
“we
don't
know
what
the
asset
is
worth”.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
well,
the
useful
life
of
the
asset
would
have
something
to
do
with
the
time.
it
couldn't
be
forever.
you'd
have
to
have
some
time
limit
and
it
have
to
be
something
other
than
a
100%.
in
other
words,
you
only
have
a
100%
when
you
got
a
top
limit
then
you
devote
everything
towards
it
that
you
can.
if
it
were
not
the
top
limit
then
it
would
be
less
than
that.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
with
your
life
expectancy
in
the
projective
profits,
if
there
were
some
reason
and
rationale
for
it,
in
other
words,
you
could
say
this
is
not
subject
to
a
--
determining
a
fixed
price
because
it's
dependent
on
a
lot
of
contingencies,
so
we
can
analyze
now.
or
if
you
can
analyze
them,
and
you
say
there's
some
relationship
to
what
you
expect
the
ultimate
take
to
be
with
your
life
expectancy,
i
would
say
that's
good,
that's
alright.
but
just
automatically
just
because
you
say
--
for
the
rest
of
my
life
25%
you
don't
have
any
rationale
for
it.
i
would
say,
i
couldn't
underwrite
it
but
if
there's
a
good
rational
for
it,
i
think
you
should
be
entitled
to
capital
gain,
you
should
have
converted
an
investment.
before
that
you
are
entitled
to
all
the
profit.
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
that's
another
thing
that
i
meant
to
cover
that
the
penalty
is
too
severe
for
the
infraction
and
i
think
they're
practically
backing
off
a
little.
another
--
mr.
william
h.
kinsey
they
don't
allow
--
they
tax
all
of
the
income
that
the
whole
million
three
is
--
they
allow
basis
recovery.
the
small
basis
for
the
stock
but
you
got
to
remember
that
the
book
value
of
the
company
is
worth
$600,000
but
--
and
they'd
had
accumulated
earnings
and
profits
upon
which
corporate
tax
have
been
paid
to
$400,000
and
more.
they
would
tax
all
that
as
ordinary
income.
and
i
think
if
there
weren't
a
sale,
the
proper
thing
is
to
tax
as
ordinary
income
the
extent
to
which
the
price
was
excessive
not
the
whole
thing.
in
other
words,
fit
the
penalty
to
the
rule
infraction.
