just

justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
this
any
different
in
substance

i'm
not
talking

constitution,

not
really

it
appears
from
the
amicus
brief
and
others,
an
arrangement
by
this
charities
can
accumulate
the
property.
and
the
donor,
the
giver,
the
seller,
whatever
you
may
call
it
they
give
benefits
by
reason
on
the
operation
of
the
tax.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
kinsey,
can
i
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
don't
read
the
tax
court
finding
of
value
exactly
the
way
you
do.
i
don't
read
it
--
i'm
looking
at
page
64.
i
don't
read
the
tax
court
to
say
that
the
value
of
these
assets
was
one
million
three.
i
read
it
to
meant
that
the
value
--
after
you
--
as
to
one
million
three
was
the
result
of
real
negotiating
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
which
is
a
different
thing?
the
result
of
real
negotiating
might
be
negotiating
this
type
of
transaction
in
light
of
its
tax
consequences
and
would
you
apply
the
same
test
in
general
motors
that
you
would
sustain
this
transaction
if
as
a
result
was
real
negotiating,
i
gave
a
higher
price
than
the
market
to
general
motors
because
the
tax
consequently
worked
out
more
favorably?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
a
reasonable
range.
