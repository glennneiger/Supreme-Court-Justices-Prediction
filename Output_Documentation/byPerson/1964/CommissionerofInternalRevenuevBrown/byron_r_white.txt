justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
may
rely
on
the
tax
advantages
of
the
buyers
to
enhance
your
purchase
price.
i
mean,
they're
reasonable
as
to
the
purchase
price
includes
--
i
mean
it
is
reasonable
to
take
advantage
of
the
buyer
tax
position
in
order
to
get
a
higher
price
to
you
by
using
the
standard
transaction.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
the
only
--
the
only
reason
you
got
a
higher
price
here
than
you
would've
had
under
the
standard
deal
is
because
of
the
institute
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
you
at
least
said
that
if
you
--
you
had
more
money
to
work
with
through
this
deal
than
what
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
$00.72
in
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
why
did
you
choose
the
institute
group
rather
than
the
tax
with
the
foundation
group
rather
than
the
--
than
your
group?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
kinsey,
what
in
your
mind
would
be
the
reason
for
getting
a
different
result
in
this
case
than
you
contend
for
now.
if
the
purchase
price
would
--
had
been
specified
here
at
say
$10
million?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
purchase
price
playing
only
out
of
--
paid
only
out
of
income.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
might
be
just
a
little
income
but
it
might
be
payable
or
you
might
be
able
to
pay
it
out
over
a
100
years
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
10
years
or
20
years
or
30
years?
where
would
the
default
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
the
advantage
refers
to
the
advantage
to
your
client
here
was
in
the
--
is
the
timing
advantage
only
that
the
rate
of
payout
is
faster
than
in
the
normal
circumstance
where
the
--
where
it
depend
on
the
appreciation
appraised?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
is
risk
against
the
--
against
risk
in
the
marketplace
as
the
--
what's
left
here.
it's
something
that
--
maybe
just
--
this
risk
doesn't
last
for
so
long.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
and
for
the
institute,
they
guaranteed
to
pay
a
certain
amount
--
certain
percentage
before
taxes.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know,
but
what
if
it
turned
out
that
they
were?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
--
and
if
--
that
would
be
on
the
basis
of
this
lease
--
had
rent
this
--
the
rental
income
really
is
a
rental
income
but
it's
from
the
operation
of
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
unless
there
a
whole
exemption
is
cancelled.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
except
that
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
the
real
--
in
your
real
world,
of
course,
the
standard
transaction,
the
buyer
runs
his
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
fellow
who
sits
there
are
being
paid
for
his
stock
out
of
the
earnings
of
the
business
he
just
sold,
sits
there
and
gets
his
money
at
capital
gains
rate
but
he
can't
determine
whether
or
not
that
company
is
going
to
be
able
to
pay
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
transaction,
this
fellow
retains
control
--
this
fellow
contains
control,
he
runs
the
business.
at
any
time
he
wanted
to,
i
suppose
you
could
say,
he
could
cause
it
to
fail.
justice
byron
r.
white
he'd
get
enough
money
on
--
that's
the
--
if
he
wants
it
back,
he
can
get
it
back.
that
isn't
true
in
your
(inaudible)
--
in
the
transaction
you
weighed
us
from
against.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
transaction.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
his
failure
to
produce
income,
his
own
failure
to
produce
income
triggers
the
default
on
the
part
of
the
other
party.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
government
contend
in
the
tax
court
or
any
place
else
that
your
client
could
not
have
sold
its
business
for
this
price
in
a
normal
transaction?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
the
--
what
--
in
tax
court,
i
gather
you
say
found
the
price
reasonable.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
did
they
mean
to
say
that
you
should've
gotten
this
price
from
anybody
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government
never
contended
this
was
an
unreason
--
that
you
could
have
gotten
this
in
a
normal
transaction?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
the
institute
have
the
right
at
any
time
to
pay
the
balance
of
the
purchase
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
if
this
business
is
really
worth
something
when
it
went
--
when
it
got
into
trouble,
it
is
--
if
the
institute
had
thought
that
the
--
is
really
worth
more
than
what
was
left
going
on
and
that
it
could've
salvaged
the
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
that?
