justice
potter
stewart
did
the
--
did
the
court
indicate
that
he
had
no
right
having
been
convicted
in
there?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
way
the
court
ruled,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
on,
the
prosecutor
has
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
--
that
he
would
testify
after
that
ruling
of
the
court.
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
so,
but
the
court
have
ruled
otherwise.
the
court
has
ruled
clearly
the
other
way.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
judge
--
the
judge
deciding
over
trial
at
least
the
judge
said
then
and
there,
it
says
what
the
law
is,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
judge
had
said
you
have
no
privilege.
justice
potter
stewart
therefore,
didn't
the
prosecutor
or
anybody
else
have
every
reasonable
ground
to
believe
that
he
would
testify.
that
he
would
have
to
follow
the
ruling
of
the
court.
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
only
went
to
your
statement.
did
the
prosecutor
had
every
reason
to
think
this
man
wouldn't
testify
and
i
thought
that
this
would
--
the
judge
have
ruled
that
he
had
to
testify
that
there
might
be
some
grounds
for
reasonable
belief
that
he
would
testify
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
without
having
ruled
but
he
had
to.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
after
it
was
all
over
on
page
129
of
the
record
mr.
gish,
mr.
esco
said,
this
is
after
the
whole
purpose
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
was
completed.
he
said
i
first
like
to
object
to
the
reading
of
this
purported
confession
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
hearsay
evidence
that
it
was
made
outside
the
hearing
of
this
defendant.
it
was
not
subject
to
cross-examination
and
we
move
to
exclude
it
from
the
evidence.
and
the
court
says,
"the
court
will
deny
your
notion
--
i
mean
your
motion."
and
mr.
esco
said,
"we
accept
it
if
you
please.
and
at
this
time
your
honor,
we
make
a
motion
for
a
mistrial
on
the
grounds
that
this
jury
has
been
so
prejudiced
from
these
proceedings
and
from
the
attempts
and
the
prosecution
to
use
illegal
evidence
that
no
fair
and
just
verdict
whatsoever
could
come
from
a
jury
that
has
been
so
pressured."
now
if
that
doesn't
make
any
clear
to
the
court
that
he
has
objected
too
and
i
don't
know
what
would
be.
