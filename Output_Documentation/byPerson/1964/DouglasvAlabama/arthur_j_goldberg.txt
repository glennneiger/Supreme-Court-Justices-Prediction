mr.
gish.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
looking
at
the
testimony
of
major
jones
and
lieutenant
holmes,
the
officers
did
testify,
you
said
that,
that
he
testified
without
objection.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
find
in
the
record
that
mr.
esco
did
object
on
the
hearsay
ground
but
he
did
object
--
for
example,
after
major
jones
testified,
mr.
esco
said,
"let
the
record
show
if
you
will
that
the
solicitor
questioned
as
the
states
exhibit
number
one."
that's
the
confession.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
we
move
to
exclude
on
the
ground
that
the
document
is
based
purely
on
hearsay.
the
court
motion
is
denied
and
then
the
same
thing
happened
when
lieutenant
holmes
testified.
so
that
really
what
mr.
esco
is
doing,
wasn't
he,
he
was
objecting
to
this
line
of
question?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
in
addition
to
that,
i
think
mr.
esco
made
it
very
clear
right
on
the
previous
page
132.
"we
would
like
to
make
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
on
the
ground
that
the
proceedings
had
been
very
irregular
here
today
and
we
feel
that
it
has
been
prejudicial
to
this
defendant."
and
i
take
it
in
what
he
was
really
saying,
you're
quite
right
that
ordinarily
the
admission
of
hearsay
would
not
amount
to
a
constitutional
right
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
and
ordinarily,
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
of
course
is
personal,
and
you
say
that
the
witness
here
was
--
he
never
--
the
defendant
never
is
required
to
testify.
wasn't
the
basis
of
mr.
esco's
objection
that
the
whole
procedure
by
which
this
accomplice
was
put
on
the
stand,
knowing
that
he
would
invoke
his
privilege
and
the
whole
reference
to
the
confession
which
did
mention
the
defendant,
and
which
your
court
--
your
appellate
court
said
was
an
inadmissible
confession
as
i
read
the
opinion?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
the
whole
procedure
was
so
prejudicial
as
to
constitute
the
denial
of
due
process,
isn't
that
to
what
mr.
esco
is
trying
to
say
throughout?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
said
that
(inaudible).
in
other
words,
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
even
though
(inaudible)
convicted
by
the
jury
and
the
judge
(inaudible)
to
the
jury.
