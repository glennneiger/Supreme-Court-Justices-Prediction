chief
justice
earl
warren
did
i
understand
you
that
the
defendant
had
take
--
or
the
witness
have
taken
an
appeal
with
the
case
that
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
notice
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cleveland,
i
wonder
--
i
wondered
why
you
conceded
so
readily
that
the
confession
was
not
introduced
an
evidence
because
after
they
read
it
to
him,
as
i
understand,
they
put
on
three
witnesses
to
show
that
the
confession
was
voluntarily
given.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
show
rather
conclusively
that
it
wasn't
for
the
purpose
of
refreshing
his
memory
but
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
using
it
as
substantive
evidence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
did
put
on
three
witnesses
to
--
placed
witnesses
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
it
was
voluntarily
given,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
--
you
may
mr.
cleveland.
mr.
gish.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gish,
what
--
what
is
the
deficiency
in
the
objection
to
this
testimony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gish,
the
thing
i
have
in
mind
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
had
in
mind
this
that
after
what
you
have
quoted
there
on
page
118,
what
mr.
esco
said,
and
the
continuation
after
the
court
calling
him
to
the
bench,
and
the
court
overruled
the
objection.
then,
when
they
--
when
they
asked
him
what
--
asked
the
witness
what
his
name
was
and
where
--
where
his
home
was,
he
says,
“i
refuse
to
answer
it”.
chief
justice
earl
warren
“on
the
grounds
that
any
answer
i
give
will
tend
to
incriminate
me
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
that
a
good
objection?
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
just
a
few
lines
beyond
that
also,
he
claimed
the
privilege
again
after
the
judge
have
told
him
that
he
didn't
have
that
privilege.
he
claimed
that
again,
didn't
he?

justice
earl
warren
of
the
defense
attorney?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
gish.
we'll
complete
tomorrow.

mr.
gish,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
perhaps
going.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
what
i
was
seeking
of
mr.
gish
was
a
--
was
this.
the
question
was,
i
will
ask
you
if
on
january
20,
1962
and
then
mr.
esco
said,
“if
your
honor
please,
i
object
to
the
reading
of
any
document
or
purported
confession
and
mr.
mccleod
for
the
state
said,
"this
is
cross-examination."
and
the
court
said,
"hostile
witness".
and
mr.
esco
said,
"we
accept,
if
you
please."
then
they
asked
another
question
and
mr.
esco
said,
"i
object
to
this
being
read
in
the
presence
of
the
jury."
and
mr.
mccleod
for
the
state
said,
"you've
already
gotten
objection
in
there."
and
esco
said
again,
"i
object
to
this
being
read
in
evidence."
the
court
said,
"overruled."
now,
isn't
that
above
as
far
as
they
should
go?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
confession
itself
mr.
gish,
that
was
read
into
evidence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is
it
your
position
mr.
gish
that
this
was
only
read
for
the
purpose
of
refreshing
his
memory?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gish
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
assuming
--
assuming
that
is
true,
why
did
the
state
put
on
three
witnesses
to
prove
that
this
confession
was
a
voluntary
confession?
if
all
of
it
--
that
the
only
purpose
of
it
was
either
to
refresh
his
memory
or
to
induce
him
to
breakdown
and
make
admissions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
had
objected
to
the
entire
line
of
testimony,
i
believe.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
if
the
--
wouldn't
the
objection
that
he
made
--
as
read
by
mr.
justice
stewart
carrying
objection
to
this
entire
line
of
testimony
and
the
judge
having
overruled
it,
wouldn't
he
be
entitled
to
believe
that
he
had
made
his
objection
adequately?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
at
the
very
--
at
the
very
outset
as
you
pointed
out
yesterday
on
page
118,
assume
as
this
witness
was
sworn
and
mr.
esco
said
that
this
time
i
like
to
--
"i'd
like
to
object
to
this
witness
appearing
on
the
stand
and
state
to
the
record
that
i
represent
this
witness
who
is
a
defendant,
who
yesterday
evening
was
convicted
of
assault
with
intent
to
murder
in
this
court,
who
has
filed
a
formal
appeal
with
this
court
and
the
appeal
bond
has
been
filed
and
approved."
now,
it
doesn't
--
wouldn't
that
carry
with
it
the
objection
to
the
entire
line
of
testimony
when
it
was
overruled
by
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
finish
your
statement.
finish
your
statement
mr.
gish
that
--
chief
justice

warren
you
may.

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cleveland,
you
may
conclude
your
argument.
