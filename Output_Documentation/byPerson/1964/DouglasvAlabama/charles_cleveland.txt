mr.
charles
cleveland
mr.
justice
black
and
the
other
justices
of
the
court.
i'm
charles
cleveland
of
the
firm
of
gordon
and
cleveland
in
birmingham,
alabama.
this
is
my
associate,
bryan
chancey
at
the
counsel
table
with
me.
we
represent
jesse
elliott
douglas,
who
was
convicted
of
assault
with
an
intent
to
murder
in
selma
in
dallas
county,
alabama.
he
was
sentenced
to
20
years
in
prison
and
justice
kate
wrote
an
opinion
for
the
court
of
appeals
of
alabama
affirming
this
conviction.
the
certiorari
to
this
court
has
been
limited
to
a
consideration
of
constitutional
issues
arising
out
of
two
factual
situations
that
occurred
during
the
defendant's
trial.
during
his
trial,
the
prosecutor
called
an
alleged
accomplice,
olen
ray
loyd
to
the
stand.
mr.
loyd
had
been
tried
in
a
companion
case
on
a
previous
day
and
a
jury
had
returned
a
verdict
against
him.
he
had
not
been
adjudicated
guilty
but
a
--
he
had
given
notice
that
he
intended
to
appeal.
this
fact
was
brought
to
the
court's
attention
when
mr.
loyd
was
called
to
the
stand
and
an
objection
was
made
to
him
being
put
on
the
stand
at
all.
and
this
objection
was
overruled.
while
he
was
on
the
stand,
the
prosecutor
read
to
him
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
a
ten-page
confession
that
he
had
made
while
he
in
the
selma
jail.
now,
this
confession
was
not
admissible
in
evidence
and
was
not
offered.
we
contend
that
each
of
these
two
factual
situations
involved
two
rules
of
constitutional
law.
one
of
these
rules
is
the
rule
enunciated
by
this
court
in
mooney
against
holohan.
this
rule
is
that
where
a
prosecutor
commits
such
conduct
that
is
prejudicial
to
the
rights
of
the
defendant
so
as
to
deprive
him
of
a
fair
trial
that
this
is
a
violation
of
due
process
of
law.
this
rule
has
been
reaffirmed
many
times
by
this
court
and
i've
cited
a
number
of
cases
in
the
briefs
and
we
contend
that
this
action
or
each
of
these
two
acts
of
the
prosecutor,
both
in
calling
mr.
loyd
to
the
stand
and
then
reading
to
him
this
inadmissible
document,
both
constitute
such
a
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
as
to
prejudice
the
jury
and
to
deny
the
defendant
a
fair
trial.
this
rule
is
based
on
a
premise
that
the
prosecutor
is
an
official
of
the
state
and
his
acts
as
a
prosecutor
are
particularly
susceptible
to
prejudice
the
jury
if
they're
not
fair
and
impartial.
now,
the
record
clearly
reveals
that
the
prosecutor
had
no
legitimate
reason
for
calling
mr.
loyd
to
the
stand.
he
had
no
reason
to
anticipate
that
he
would
testify
as
to
anything.
mr.
loyd,
the
previous
day,
had
repudiated
his
own
confession
and
had
refused
to
take
the
stand
on
his
own
behalf.
the
prosecutor
has
not
made
any
claim
or
the
state
doesn't
claim
that
there
was
any
evidence
that
the
prosecutor
felt
that
he
might
testify
and
when
he
was
called
to
the
stand,
the
defendant's
attorney
who
was
also
mr.
loyd's
attorney
objected
to
his
being
called
to
the
stand
and
told
the
court
that
he
would
intend
to
take
his
constitutional
rights.
in
spite
of
this,
the
court
allowed
him
to
be
put
on
the
stand,
primarily
for
the
purpose
of
invoking
his
rights
against
self-incrimination
which
in
turn
prejudiced
the
jury.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
cleveland
yes,
that
was
the
court's
opinion.
the
court
stated
that
because
of
his
prior
conviction
--
mr.
charles
cleveland
--
the
previous
day
he
had
lost
his
constitutional
right.
mr.
charles
cleveland
that
--
that
was
the
ruling
of
the
court
at
that
time.
mr.
charles
cleveland
i'll
say
this.
it
is
our
position
that
the
law
is
clear.
mr.
charles
cleveland
that's
correct.
the
court
had
ruled
that.
we
take
the
position
that
the
prosecutor
is
--
knowing,
what
the
law
would
be,
had
no
reason
to
call
him
in
the
first
place.
mr.
charles
cleveland
yes.
but
that
was
the
ruling
of
the
court.
mr.
charles
cleveland
yes,
and
ordered
him
to
testify.
mr.
charles
cleveland
well,
we
take
the
position
that
the
man
was
in
a
position
where
he
must
protect
his
constitutional
right
and
not
answer
under
these
circumstances
because
he
was
illiterate
and
a
man
of
limited
education.
he
did
answer
some
questions
evasively,
say,
he
didn't
remember
or
he
didn't
know
things
like
he's
being
put
in
jail
a
few
weeks
prior.
mr.
charles
cleveland
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
cleveland
i
don't
see
how
an
action
of
the
judge
could
restrict
the
rights
of
the
defendant
anymore
than
the
actions
of
the
prosecutor.
mr.
charles
cleveland
well,
he
--
mr.
charles
cleveland
the
prosecutor
did
get
a
favorable
ruling
on
that
issue.
mr.
charles
cleveland
the
witness
had
given
a
notice
--
mr.
charles
cleveland
--
of
appeal.
that
notice
had
not
been
allowed
because
he
had
not
been
formally
adjudicated.
mr.
charles
cleveland
a
jury
had
returned
a
verdict
against
him.
and
in
fact,
when
he
refused
to
testify
and
after
continually
being
asked
these
questions
over
and
over
again
after
being
--
the
court
threatened
to
put
him
in
contempt.
the
court
then
recessed
that
case
and
during
that
recess
sentenced
this
man
and
gave
him
the
same
sentence
as
the
defendant
in
this
case
20
years.
mr.
charles
cleveland
no,
sir.
that
question
has
been
--
been
litigated
and
he's
not
entitled
to
an
appeal
until
after
he's
adjudicated.
mr.
charles
cleveland
yes,
that's
right.
a
notice
of
appeal
after
adjudication
takes
it
out
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
the
amount
of
the
bond
had
been
said
in
a
prior
order
and
set
aside
during
the
morning
of
this
trial.
the
--
this
issue's
precisely
has
never
been
before
this
court
but
the
highest
courts
of
colorado,
florida
and
texas
have
ruled
on
this
issue
and
held
that
in
similar
instances,
the
court
has
that
the
defendant
has
been
deprived
of
due
process.
there
is
an
a.l.r.
annotation
in
which
the
writer
attempted
to
summarize
all
of
the
cases
at
that
time
involving
this
issue.
and
the
writer
has
said
that
at
least
in
--
where
five
circumstances,
all
occurred
at
the
same
time,
all
the
courts
have
universally
held
without
dissent
that
this
is
a
violation
of
due
process
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
adopted
these
five
situations
as
criteria
for
this
issue
in
the
state
of
florida.
these
issues
are
that
there
must
be
a
close
connection
between
the
activities
of
the
witness
and
the
defendant
so
that
the
jury
would
imply
some
connection
between
them.
the
prosecutor
must
not
have
any
valid
reason
to
expect
the
witness
to
rate
--
waive
his
privilege.
if
the
witness,
for
example,
voluntarily
takes
the
stand
and
answers
many
questions,
an
occasional
question
that
might
go
over
this
bound
would
not
fall
within
this
rule.
and
the
witness
must
have
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
refusal
to
--
a
right
to
refuse
to
testify
and
the
defendant
must
have
made
appropriate
objection
and
the
court
must
have
failed
to
give
appropriate
instruction
to
admonish
the
jury
or
not
to
consider
this.
the
state
doesn't
contend
that
--
or
doesn't
dispute
the
presence
of
any
of
these
circumstances
except
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
refuse
to
testify.
the
state
has
cited
three
second
circuit
cases
to
the
effect
that
the
defendant
--
that
the
witness
would
not
have
a
right
to
testify
under
the
certain
--
would
not
have
a
right
to
refuse
under
these
circumstances.
and
we
submit
that
all
three
of
those
cases,
the
judgment
had
become
final,
the
defendnt
had
not
appeal
and
it
--
there
was
no
possibility
of
a
reversal.
one
of
the
cases
involved
a
juvenile
proceeding
which
was
not
absolutely
final.
the
highest
court
of
idaho
in
considering
this
strong
a
distinction
as
to
where
the
right
of
appeal
still
remains.
there
is
a
--
a
right
on
the
witness
to
refuse
to
testify
and
in
this
case,
the
witness
had
not
even
been
adjudicated
so
his
trial
was
actually
still
in
progress.
the
state
also
contends
that
--
always,
a
prosecutor
never
knows
when
a
witness
may
waive
his
rights
and
that
just
as
a
matter
of
actual
knowledge
that
--
on
the
prospect
that
lightning
might
strike
and
this
witness
might
decide
to
waive
his
privilege
at
the
last
moment
that
that
is
sufficient
to
justify
calling
a
witness.
and
we
submit
that
it's
not
on
duly
harsh
on
a
prosecutor
and
it's
not
evasive
of
the
rights
of
justice
to
require
a
prosecutor
to
have
some
idea
that
a
witness
that
--
he
is
going
to
put
on
the
stand
is
going
to
testify
as
to
some
relevant
information.
some
evidence
before
the
court,
lawyers
generally
know,
what
witnesses,
what
evidence
they
intend
or
expect
to
get
by
a
witness
when
they
call
him
to
the
stand?
mr.
charles
cleveland
we
feel
that
calling
him
to
the
stand
is
misconduct
and
that
i
don't
believe
that
--
just
calling
him
to
the
stand
for
the
purposes
of
having
him
invoke
his
constitutional
rights
is
misconduct
within
the
holohan
rule.
mr.
charles
cleveland
no.
we
have
the
second
incident
and
that
is
the
reading
of
the
confession
while
he
was
on
the
stand.
now,
this
was
a
ten-page
document
that
had
been
taken
by
the
police
officials
in
selma
jail
some
two
or
three
weeks
prior
to
this
trial.
and
the
prosecutor
first
asked
the
witness,
did
he
remember
being
in
jail
and
the
witness
refused
to
testify
then
became
evasive
after
he
was
ordered
by
the
court
to
testify.
and
then
the
prosecutor
began
reading
the
confession.
when
he
first
began,
the
defendant
attorney
objected
to
this
document
being
read
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
the
court
overruled
this.
the
prosecutor
then
began
reading
it
again,
the
defendant
objected
again
and
then
the
prosecutor
said,
“well,
you've
already
got
your
objection.”
and
the
defendant
says,
“well,
i
object
anyway.”
and
then
the
court
overruled
the
objection
and
the
prosecutor
indicated
that
he
accept
it
from
this
ruling.
mr.
charles
cleveland
no.
the
confession
was
not
--
it
was
identified
as
exhibit
1
but
it
was
never
offered
evidence.
mr.
charles
cleveland
we
have
cautionary
instructions,
none
were
given.
mr.
charles
cleveland
no.
no
questions
were
asked
for
--
about
the
confession
at
all.
mr.
charles
cleveland
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
cleveland
yes.
on
several
occasions,
the
defendant's
attorney
did
ask
for
a
mistrial
because
this
confession
had
been
read
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
and
as
to
the
question
of
misconduct,
we
come
to
--
to
the
point
of
what
legitimate
reason
could
the
prosecutor
have
for
having
read
this
confession.
at
the
time,
when
the
objection
was
made,
he
gave
his
reason
merely,
this
is
cross-examination.
prior
to
that
time,
the
court
had
declared
this
witness
a
hostile
witness
and
given
the
prosecutor
a
right
of
cross-examination
because
of
the
witness
invoking
his
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment.
the
state
now
contends
in
their
brief
that
it
might
have
been
permissible
to
show
surprise
or
to
refresh
the
memory
of
a
witness
that
the
prosecutor
was
surprised
or
could
have
been
as
incredible.
the
matter
of
refreshing
the
witness'
recollection
is
how
this
point
was
ruled
on
by
the
court
of
appeals.
they
held
that
it
was
justifiable
under
--
as
a
matter
to
refresh
his
recollection.
prior
there's
an
opinion
of
the
alabama
supreme
court,
the
case
of
kissick
against
state,
in
which
the
court
has
specifically
set
out
two
procedures,
alternative
procedures
or
a
--
the
use
by
a
prosecutor
to
refresh
the
recollection
of
witness
from
inadmissible
documents
or
material
that
is
inadmissible
in
evidence.
the
kissick
case
involved
a
recording
which
had
been
made
of
a
prior
conversation
by
the
witness
outside
the
presence
of
the
defendant.
and
the
court
in
that
case
said,
that
the
--
this
is
--
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
said,
that
the
proper
procedure
was
to
have
the
recording
transcribed
and
to
merely
give
it
to
the
witness
and
let
the
witness
read
it
orally
or
read
it
silently
so
that
the
jury
couldn't
hear
the
contents
or
as
an
alternative,
it
could
have
been
read
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
mr.
charles
cleveland
i
meant
by
my
statement
that
it
was
not
ruled
on
by
the
court
as
properly
admissible
in
evidence.
the
content
of
the
confession
was
put
before
the
jury
and
was
certainly
treated
by
the
jury
as
if
it
were
evidence.
mr.
charles
cleveland
but
it
was
not
formally
allowed
or
admitted
into
--
into
evidence
by
the
judge.
mr.
charles
cleveland
to
prove
its
execution.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
cleveland
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
charles
cleveland
the
form
of
the
reading
is
the
--
the
prosecutor
read
a
paragraph
and
at
the
close
that
paragraph
--
mr.
charles
cleveland
i
wasn't
present.
the
record
doesn't
show.
mr.
charles
cleveland
while
the
witness
was
on
the
stand
and
--
mr.
charles
cleveland
at
each
paragraph,
he
paused
to
ask
the
witness,
“did
you
say
that?”
and
the
witness
said,
“i
refuse
to
testify
on
the
grounds
that
it
might
tend
to
incriminate
me.”
mr.
charles
cleveland
the
jury
was
in
the
box
at
that
time.
mr.
charles
cleveland
the
defendant's
attorney
had
objected
three
times
to
the
reading
of
the
confession
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
he
didn't
say
in
so
many
words
a
request
to
excuse
the
jury.
he
had
merely
--
mr.
charles
cleveland
he
is
--
the
phrasing
of
his
objection
was
that
he
objected
to
this
document
being
read
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
this
objection
was
overruled.
mr.
charles
cleveland
the
waiver
that
the
court
speaks
of
is
a
waiver
to
make
an
objection.
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
in
its
opinion
that
the
defendant's
attorney
failed
to
make
an
objection.
this
court
of
course
has
a
duty
to
examine
the
record
and
the
record
clearly
shows
that
when
the
reading
first
started,
the
defendant's
attorney
made
objections
three
times.
the
judge
overruled
this
twice
on
two
occasions.
and
the
prosecutor
said,
“well,
you've
already
got
your
objection
there.”
and
at
that
point,
the
defendant's
attorney
could
object
as
each
paragraph
was
read
and
the
witness
refused
to
testify.
then
the
defendant's
attorney
did
not
continue
to
make
objections
throughout.
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
the
failure
to
continue
to
make
the
same
objection
after
each
pause
and
after
each
paragraph
was
waived.
the
other
rule
of
law
that
we
think
is
pertinent
to
both
of
this
factual
situations
is
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
cross-examine
the
evidence
against
him.
it's
well
settled
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
of
confrontation
includes
the
right
to
cross-examine
and
we
contend
that
this
is
such
a
fundamental
right
that
it
has
embodied
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
case
of
snyder
against
massachusetts,
justice
cardozo
assumed
that
this
right
was
reinforced
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
mr.
justice
black
in
--
in
re
oliver
described
this
right
as
basic.
mr.
justice
douglas
has
described
this
right
in
willner
against
the
committee,
both
in
writing
the
opinions
for
the
majority
of
the
court
as
necessary
for
procedural
due
process.
the
highest
courts
of
washington,
michigan,
florida,
and
oklahoma
have
all
indicated
that
the
right
of
cross-examination
is
essential
to
due
process.
and
we
don't
think
that
it
can
be
seriously
disputed
that
the
defendant
was
denied
the
effective
right
to
cross-examination
--
of
cross-examining
both
the
implications
drawn
by
the
jury
from
the
--
from
the
witness
taking
the
stand
and
refusing
to
testify
on
his
constitutional
rights
and
the
actual
contents
of
the
confession
that
was
read
to
the
jury.
and
we
feel
that
this
right
to
cross-examine
--
cross-examine
is
so
basic
that
it
should
be
granted
under
the
constitution,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
that
--
when
the
state
call
the
witness
to
testify.
he
should
have
--
in
calling
the
witness
to
testify
to
take
the
fifth
amendment
that
his
is
an
implication
that
the
--
the
defendant
is
incapable
of
effective
cross-examination
and
of
course
the
contents
of
the
confession.
he
had
no
opportunity
to
go
into
those.
mr.
charles
cleveland
that
it
was
--
mr.
charles
cleveland
--
hearsay.
yes.
mr.
charles
cleveland
yes.
mr.
charles
cleveland
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
specific
--
mr.
charles
cleveland
that's
correct.
at
least
to
the
extent
that
--
mr.
charles
cleveland
--
that
there
is
a
right
of
cross-examination.
mr.
charles
cleveland
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
cleveland
thank
you.
mr.
charles
cleveland
i
would
like
to
save
some
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
cleveland
yes,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
we
do
not
contend
as
mr.
gish
said
yesterday
that,
"a
state
can
never
call
an
accomplice
to
the
stand."
but
we
do
contend
that
in
a
situation
like
this
where
when
he
is
called,
an
objection
is
made
and
the
court
is
notified
that
he
intends
to
invoke
his
constitutional
rights
against
incrimination
that
there
is
a
constitutional
duty
on
the
court
there
to
inquire
as
to
whether
he's
going
to
testify
or
not
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
and
by
analogy
to
the
kissick
case
that
this
can
be
done
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
alabama
and
should
have
been
done
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
cleveland
the
judge
ruled
to
that
effect
but
the
witness
never
testified
in
this
entire
proceeding
could
have
very
well
been
handled
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
the
objection
of
the
defense
attorney
was
directed
to
this
being
done
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
so
that
--
had
the
--
our
concern
is
the
implications
that
withdrawn
from
the
jury,
from
these
proceedings,
had
the
jury
been
excused
and
in
these
things
--
things
occurred
then,
douglas
would
not
have
been
prejudiced
to
the
extent
that
he
was
by
the
implications
that
the
jury
drew
from
these
acts
before
them.
mr.
charles
cleveland
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
cleveland
that's
correct.
and
it
wasn't
--
is
not
this
judge's
ruling
in
that
specific
case.
that
applies
to
loyd
as
mr.
gish
has
said.
it's
the
reaction
that
that
the
jury
received
from
these
entire
proceedings.
and
i
would
like
to
read
just
the
specific
objection.
i
will
say
that
i
believe
that
throughout
this
proceeding,
mr.
douglas
--
mr.
esco
made
as
main
objections
as
he
felt
he
could
possibly
make
without
affirming
the
dignity
of
the
court.
it's
replete
with
objections
in
each
one
bringing
in
the
same
thing
in
a
different
forum
but
the
solicitor
started
this
question.
"i
will
ask
you
if
on
the
night
of
january
20,
1962,
in
selma,
alabama
in
the
dallas
county
jail,
if
you
didn't
make
the
following
statement.
reading,
"i,
olen
ray
loyd
make
the
--."
at
that
point
mr.
esco
interrupting,
"i,
object
to
this
being
read
in
the
presence
of
the
jury"
and
we
submit
that
that
is
as
sufficient
and
as
adequate
objection
as
a
defense
counsel
can
--
could
be
called
on
to
make.
mr.
charles
cleveland
it's
on
page
121,
right
in
the
middle
of
the
page.
now,
the
contention
of
the
state,
that
--
thereafter,
when
the
prosecutor
was
reading
these
questions
that
because
he
didn't
get
answers,
the
matter
wasn't
in
evidence.
we
contend
that
it
is
obvious
from
reading
this
that
this
was
a
device
that
the
form
of
the
question
was
a
device
to
impart
the
contents
of
this
confession
to
the
jury.
and
in
this
confession,
loyd
clearly
implicates
the
defendant.
he
says
in
effect,
"i
was
alone.
i
was
driving
but
mr.
douglas
did
the
actual
shooting."
so
that
that
this
device
of
reading
this
confession
that
took
some
seven
pages
in
the
transcript
was
ten
pages
long
in
its
entirety.
the
solicitor
read
the
entire
thing
through
in
front
of
the
jury
and
we
submit
that
that
was
merely
a
device
to
get
this
information,
the
contents
of
this
before
the
jury.
according
to
the
kissick
case
that
the
prosecutor
could
have
just
handed
it
to
mr.
esco
and
asked
him
to
read
it.
if
only
wanted
to
do
was
to
refresh
his
memory.
of
course
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
loyd
was
semi-illiterate
and
probably
couldn't
have
read
it
intelligently.
so,
the
kissick
case
gave
an
alternative.
they
said
you
can
excuse
the
jury
and
then
read
aloud
to
him.
so,
either
of
these
alternatives
were
available
to
the
solicitor.
had
all
he
wanted
to
do
was
to
refresh
this
man's
recollection?
but
it
is
clear
from
what
he
actually
did
do,
that
his
intention
and
his
purpose,
was
to
provide
a
method
or
device
so
that
the
contents
of
this
confession
would
get
before
the
jury.
he
didn't
offer
it
in
evidence,
but
the
fact
that
he
didn't
offer
it
in
evidence
doesn't
alleviate
the
action
that
he
has
done
in
making
the
contents
available
so
that
the
jury
heard
it.
and
we
submit
that
it
--
it's
not
actually
the
form
of
the
question
that
is
important
but
actually
the
content
of
this
question.
i
thank
you.
