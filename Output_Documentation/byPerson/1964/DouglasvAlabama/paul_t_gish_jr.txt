mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
primary
contention
of
the
state
of
alabama
is
that,
we
have
a
question
of
procedure
of
whether
or
not
the
constitutional
guarantee
if
that
--
if
warrant
was
presented
in
this
case.
the
--
if
the
court
please,
beginning
of
the
loyd
testimony
is
on
page
118
of
the
record,
the
court
will
note
as
what
mr.
cleveland
pointed
out
that,
if
it
please,
objection
was
made
to
the
witness
being
called
to
the
stand.
now,
that
objection
should
represent
no
constitutional
question.
i
hope
we
are
not
to
appoint
to
whether
state
cannot
call
an
accomplice
to
the
stand.
the
state
must,
in
many
cases,
depend
largely
upon
the
testimony
of
accomplices.
i
am
the
misfortuned
when
i
was
a
defendant's
lawyer
to
be
confronted
with
the
testimony
of
two
accomplices
who
were
in
state's
evidence,
so
i
know
that
the
state
must
use
in
many
instances
an
accomplice.
i
think
the
real
question
in
this
case
though
is
what
actually
did
happen?
what
did
the
record
show
happened
here
after
this
man
is
called
to
the
stand?
the
defense
attorney
was
not
mr.
cleveland.
first
of
all,
see
this
--
your
objection
to
the
use
of
the
statements,
that's
on
page
119,
the
objection
was
overruled.
but
the
second
objection
--
objection
to
the
same
effect
and
as
mr.
cleveland
points
out
the
solicitor
said,
when
you
have
your
objection
in
there.
now,
will
any
defense
attorney
--
does
any
defense
attorney
have
the
right
to
go
on
where
the
solicitor,
“did
you
have
an
objection
here?”
my
answer,
if
the
court
please
is,
“no”.
the
judge
can
only
rule
on
objections.
now,
i
don't
know
why
mr.
esco
didn't
object
after
the
beginning
of
the
questions
concerning
the
contents
of
the
statements.
but
suppose
he
had
objected
to
the
first
question
and
suppose
the
objection
had
been
overruled,
surely
no
--
no
constitutional
way
it
would
have
been
presented
because
there's
nothing
in
the
first
question
which
would
be
even
slightly
damaging
to
this
defendant.
the
same
is
true
of
the
second
question.
the
same
is
true
of
the
third
question.
that
the
other
questions
had
they
been
objected
to
possibly
constitute
the
question
would
have
been
presented
as
possible
--
possibly.
the
court
should
have
sustained
the
supposedly
objections.
but
here
in
this
case,
if
the
court
would
please,
we
don't
have
--
they're
not
there
--
there
have
been
objections.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
mr.
justice
warren,
on
page
118
of
the
record,
the
first
objection
as
opposed
by
mr.
esco,
the
defense
attorney,
is
that
you
shouldn't
put
this
man
on
the
stand
because
he's
an
accomplice.
that
objection
was
overruled.
the
second
objection
is
on
page
119
at
the
top
of
the
page
that
mr.
esco
is
complaining
his
grounds
for
objection.
about
the
middle
of
the
page,
he
says
--
wait
a
second,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i
can
take
this.
i
don't
want
to
take
the
time,
but
i
think
if
i'm
right,
what
you
have
in
mind
is
whether
or
not
an
objection
to
this
whole
procedure
made
by
the
defense
attorney.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
is
that
what
you
asked?
is
that
your
question?
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
would
that
be
a
--
would
that
be
an
objection
that
could
be
sustained?
the
mere
question
of,
“what
is
your
name
--
name?”
i'm
not
trying
to
answer
your
sole
question,
but
what
i
am
trying
to
say
is
that
there
were
a
few
objections
to
the
preliminary
matters
here
from
page
118
to
121.
but
--
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
yes,
he
claims
it.
he
kept
claiming
it.
but
i'm
--
so
i
am
talking
about
the
objection
of
the
defense
attorney.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first
off
mr.
chief
justice,
i
wish
to
apologize
to
you
and
say
that
i
did
not
understand
your
questions
yesterday
until
the
time
had
expired.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
i
agree
that
olen
ray
loyd,
the
accomplice,
refused
to
answer
any
questions
except
they
have
preliminary
warrants.
in
that
sense
that
was
an
objection
to
his
testimony
all
the
way
through.
however,
it
is
a
contention
of
the
state
of
alabama
that
that
objection
was
a
personal
warrant
and
was
not
an
objection
by
douglas
by
the
petitioner
here.
and
i
was
talking
about
the
objections
made
by
mr.
esco,
the
defense
attorney.
now,
mr.
esco
objected
for
the
last
time
on
page
121
of
the
record
and
he
--
the
first
statement
on
that
page
by
mr.
esco
was
that
he
objected
to
the
reading
of
the
statement.
now,
we
submit
that
at
that
time,
those
statements
had
been
read
and
jury
had
said
that
he
was
a
hostile
witness
during
those
cross-examinations
and
--
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
my
own
answer
to
that
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
at
that
time,
i
submit
that
the
trial
judge
cannot
be
charged
with
the
deed
of
knowing
what
the
solicitor
was
going
to
do.
the
only
thing
that
had
been
done
at
that
time
by
the
solicitor
was
the
beginning
of
the
question.
i
will
ask
you
if
on
january
20th
and
that
just
what
they
got.
he
had
not
even
completed
his
first
question.
now,
the
trial
judge
at
that
time
we
submit
made
cannot
be
charged
with
the
duty
of
knowing
what
this
procedure
was
going
to
be.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
do
not
want
to
evade
your
question
at
all
but
i
wonder
if
i
may
answer
it
in
this
manner.
we
have
in
this
case
that
only
the
question
of
whether
douglas'
rights
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
had
been
violated.
we
could
have
--
the
court
could
have
--
the
solicitor
could
have
violated
every
right
that
loyd
had
under
any
section
of
the
constitution.
but
if
in
doing
that,
he
did
not
violate
a
constitutional
right
of
douglas,
then
this
case,
we
submit
should
be
affirmed.
now
as
i
said,
the
primary
argument
of
the
state
is
that
this
could
rest
on
an
adequate
state
ground.
it
seems
to
me
and
we
submit
that
the
only
prejudicial,
allegedly
prejudicial
thing
that
was
done
insofar
as
douglas
was
concerned,
was
that
he
was
--
was
as
loyd
was
asked
by
the
solicitor
leaving
question
--
questions
which
if
had
been
answered
would
have
ejected
hearsay
evidence
into
this
case
and
no
doubt
that
loyd
would
answer.
therefore,
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
case.
we
have
questions
and
the
refusal
to
answer
in
this
case,
and
not
--
not
evidence.
now
--
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
it
was
--
if
we
want
to
--
i
mean,
in
that
matter
sir,
it
was
read
into
evidence,
you
know,
it
was
read
in
the
courtroom
in
the
form
of
questions.
we
don't
know
or
i
don't
know
but
i
have
heard
that
if
loyd
repudiate
his
confession
at
his
trial
the
day
before,
he
could
at
their
will
repudiate
it
again.
he
could
have
said,
yes
i've
made
that
statement
but
it
was
a
lie.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
yes
sir.
it
was
--
with
the
qualification,
i
want
to
say
this
that
i
know
from
experience
that
many
times,
other
men
had
been
convicted
of
a
crime
in
which
another
person
is
implicated
that
he
had
attitude
or
why
should
i
serve
a
sentence
here
and
let
my
buddy
who
are
with
me
all
has
got
free.
in
other
words,
he
turns
state
evidence.
now,
i
submit
the
solicitor
undoubtedly
had
right
to
call
loyd
to
the
stand
and
i
also
submit
that
the
solicitor
would
perfectly
within
his
right
to
endeavor
to
get
loyd
to
bring
some
--
something
they
shouldn't
or
to
testify
in
some
matter
connecting
--
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
only
answer
that
i
can
give
to
that
is
that
--
that
the
evidence
into
which
you
offer
would
put
on
without
an
objection
at
all
on
the
part
of
douglas.
there
was
no
objection.
i
realized
refer
it
to
law,
i
have
to
say
--
say
that
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
your
question.
i
don't
know
why
mr.
mccleod
did
it.
i
think
though
that
insofar
as
looking
at
the
effect
of
it
that
as
i
said
this
evidence
was
put
on
without
any
objection
from
mr.
esco.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
he
had
objected
and
moved
to
exclude
the
evidence.
and
he
also
made
a
move
for
from
esco
that
in
motion
to
exclude
the
evidence.
i
can
only
come
in
then
by
asking
a
question,
what
evidence?
there's
none
of
the
questions
had
been
answered.
there
was
no
testimony
at
all
from
loyd
except
in
name
and
they
had
a
difficult
time
in
getting
him
to
state
his
name.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
if
we
admit
that
mr.
chief
justice
and
in
a
sense,
we
have
to
admit
that
except
as
i
said,
none
of
the
questions
were
ever
answered.
there
was
nothing
in
evidence
where
we
had
the
questions
before
the
jury
and
it
was
virtually
read
in
evidence.
and
after
every
paragraph
he
says,
"did
you
said
that?"
well,
that
is
a
leading
question
if
there
ever
was
one.
but
it
was
--
he
would
have
the
witness
had
been
declared
so
by
the
court
giving
the
solicitor
a
right
to
ask
leading
questions.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
--
i
think
they
would
if
it's
my
contingent,
our
own
contingent,
that
the
only
thing
we
have
here
is
an
intent
to
inject
hearsay
evidence
into
this
case
against
douglas
that
there
was
--
there
was
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
inject
the
evidence.
being
unsuccessful,
the
question
i
submit
to
this
court
is
whether
that
unsuccessful
attempt
violates
any
constitutional
right
deemed
by
fourteenth
amendment.
we
don't
have
the
question
here
violating
loyd's
right.
loyd
is
not
involved
in
this
case
and
i
will
to
submit
that
in
brief
i
fell
into
the
trap
sent
for
me
by
the
petitioner's
brief.
i
talked
a
lot
about
the
self-incrimination
angle
and
i
said
the
way
that
i
briefed
the
case
that
that's
not
the
point
involved
here.
there's
no
self-incrimination
here
as
far
as
douglas
is
concerned.
douglas
never
even
took
the
stand
and
self-incrimination
is
a
personal
claim.
now,
--
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
well,
maybe
mr.
justice
goldberg
but
as
i
read
the
record,
he's
objecting
then
to
any
introductions
of
the
document
into
evidence.
and
of
course,
the
document
was
never
--
are
offered
into
evidence.
so
it's
the
states'
contingent
that
any
ruling
and
that
objection
had
no
bearing
here
because
the
objection
was
not
asked.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
right.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
may
be
so.
it
may
be
that
his
attempt
to
do
that.
now,
our
contingent
is
this,
even
if
he
made
such
an
attempt
that
actually
what
do
we
have
in
this
record
then
violate
any
constitutional
right
on
the
petition.
that's
the
only
answer
i
can
give
to
you
now
--
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
well,
i
wanted
to
go
--
i
wanted
to
go
just
a
moment
into
one
last
point.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
on
page
100
--
no,
245
of
the
record.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
court
there,
the
appellate
court
is
talking
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
sustain
the
verdict
in
this
case.
and
no,
i
don't
want
to
get
outside
of
the
issues
but
the
thing
that
i
wish
to
say
here
is
that
even
if
a
confession,
i
do
--
i
am
not
admitting
that
any
error
will
make
it.
but
even
if
that
one
error,
the
state
wishes
to
submit
that
there
was
ample
evidence
as
shown
and
is
attached,
there
were
ample
evidence
to
sustain
the
verdict
of
the
jury
without
this
evidence
at
all
in
the
record.
and
then
i
did
want
to
point
that
out
and
i
thank
you
sir.
