justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
if
i
had
to
build
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
in
fact
it's
been
a
breach
by
iowa
of
this
promise,
is
that
enough
to
give
you
an
interest
to
ask
us
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
go
to
the
rest
of
it.
you
don't
need
it,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
you
should.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
has
really
moved
nebraska
to
come
in
to
--
into
this
court
when
these
very
same
issues
are
going
to
be
litigated
in
the
--
or
litigatable
in
the
iowa
courts
between
the
individual
property
owners
and
the
state
of
iowa?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
these
people
who
were
agitating
are
citizens
of
iowa
now,
aren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
own
land
over
in
iowa?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they're
thinking
--
these
people
think
that
you
want
to
do
their
litigating?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
this
whether
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
rather
attempt
with
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
going
to
be
a
substantial
undertaking
i
suppose
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
determine
there's
a
lot
of
history,
a
lot
of
facts
that
have
been
--
that
has
to
be
found
out
as
to
where
this
line
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
suppose
it
might
cause
a
private
litigatant
if
you
were
litigating
with
the
state
of
iowa
to
private
lawsuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
wouldn't
bind
the
private
litigants?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
would
there
be
for
us
in
the
file
of
litigation
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
that
raise
a
federal
question
you
think
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
even
if
it
did
raise
the
federal
question,
its
still
be
open
to
question.
i
suppose,
will
that
be
binding
to
the
state
of
nebraska?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
legal
question
you're
presenting
here
is
whether
when
you
don't
have
an
interest
in
the
--
you
may
not
have
an
actual
interest
as
the
state
in
any
of
its
land
although
you
allege
an
interest
to
50
feet
of
it
but
assuming
you
didn't
--
what
you're
really
saying
is,
is
there
anyway
to
enforce
the
compact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
any
of
those
cases
involved
compacts
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
in
that
sense,
as
regard
to
the
application
of
that
principle,
this
is
the
first
time
that
question
has
been
here,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
just
concede
that
nebraska
has
no
interest
in
any
of
these
lands.
let's
assume
that
for
the
moment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
interest
in
any
of
the
land
and
that
the
only
people
that
have
any
interest
in
the
land
are
private
parties.
you
say
ipso
facto
nebraska
can't
bring
this
suit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they
alleged
that
iowa
is
not
living
up
to
its
promise
to
recognize
those
titles
and
admitting
that
nebraska
has
no
interest
in
the
--
in
that
land,
doesn't
own
any
interest
in
the
lands.
why
hasn't
nebraska
get
an
interest
in
saying
to
iowa,
“do
you
promise
to
respect
those
titles?
do
you
see
that
as
regards
to
that
very
land
that
we
conveyed
to
you,
you
are
making
a
claim
of
ownership
to
it?
and
that
isn't
respecting
the
title.
you
are
breaching
section
3.”
now,
why
hasn't
nebraska
got
an
interest
in
saying
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
you
deny
it
but
let's
--
but
the
claim
is
made
and
you
have
to
accept
that
it's
true
on
its
face,
don't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
because
this
if
they
have
not
pleaded
a
breach.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
exactly
pleaded
a
breach,
then
your
--
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
you
look
at
the
bill
of
complaint
they
have
not
pleaded
the
breach
of
the
compact,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
of
course
this
court
has
said
in
regard
to
that
in
another
case
that
was
here
that
with
--
the
litigation
was
between
a
state
and
private
parties
that
no
matter
how
that
litigation
came
out
wouldn't
--
it
wouldn't
preclude
the
claim
of
the
state
of
the
other
state.
