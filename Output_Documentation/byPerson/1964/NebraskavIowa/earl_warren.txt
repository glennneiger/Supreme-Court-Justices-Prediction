chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
moldenhauer,
may
i
ask
you?
has
the
line
been
definitely
fixed
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
may
i
ask,
is
there
a
dispute
between
nebraska
and
iowa
as
to
which
state
this
particular
piece
of
property
is
in?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
to
that
50
feet?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
this
essentially
a
boundary
dispute
between
iowa
and
nebraska?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
there
was
sort
of
a
nebulous
zone
all
along
the
river
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
river
now
that
--
and
would
naturally
involve
a
great
number
of
property
rights.
would
that
mean
that
every
time
an
owner
has
a
problem
of
that
kind
that
the
states
would
come
in
on
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
this
just
a
factual
situation
here
that
could
be
determined
by
another
court
between
the
parties?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
you
that
the
state
of
nebraska
doesn't
claim
any
sovereignty
over
this
land.
it
doesn't
claim
the
right
to
tax
as
to
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
doesn't
claim
any
--
anything
as
protecting
the
rights
of
this
individual
landowner
that
you
think
should
not
be
subjected
to
an
action
of
this
kind
but
that
the
state
ought
to
defend
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
would
our
resolution
of
this
case
resolve
all
your
other
rights
along
the
river?
chief
justice
earl
warren
advisory
opinion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
that
this
land
which
is
now
in
iowa
under
the
compact
is
forever
immune
from
treatment
by
iowa
in
the
same
nondiscriminatory
way
that
it
treats
iowa
land
of
its
own
citizens?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
what
your
version
of
the
compact
is?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
violation
under
the
compact
that
you
assert?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
isn't
this
--
doesn't
this
relate
to
some
avulsion
with
respect
to
that
land?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is
it
your
theory
here
that
iowa
is
treating
this
land
that
belongs
to
nebraska
citizens
any
differently
from
the
way
it's
treating
land
of
a
similar
type
which
is
owned
by
iowa
citizens.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
that
be
very
important
because
does
--
do
you
read
this
compact
to
give
to
this
land
anymore
status
than
iowa
land
would
be
given?
in
other
words,
when
the
compact
says,
“title
shall
be
good
in
iowa”,
does
it
mean
super
seniority
title,
is
that
the
way
you're
interpreting
the
compact?
