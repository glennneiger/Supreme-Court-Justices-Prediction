justice
hugo
l.
black
in
view
of
the
argument
that
you're
making
now,
i
don't
understand
the
answer
you
gave
to
justice
brennan
or
justice
white
that
you
did
not
regard
the
question
of
nebraska
having
no
interest
in
this
land
as
such
itself
as
a
state
was
dispositive
of
the
original
jurisdiction
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
as
i
understand
that
you
are
saying
that
the
controlling
question
is
the
lack
of
interest
in
the
point
of
view
of
original
jurisdiction,
the
lack
of
interest
that
nebraska
has
in
this
land.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
might
not
understand
the
qualification,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
excuse
me,
(inaudible)
--
i'm
sorry.
