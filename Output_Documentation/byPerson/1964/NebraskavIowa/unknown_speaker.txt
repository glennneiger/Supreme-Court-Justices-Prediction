mr.
moldenhauer,
following
justice
white's
question,
suppose
this.
suppose
that
the
land
was
ceded
to
iowa
under
the
compact,
your
compact
of
section
3
says,
"title
shall
be
good
in
iowa
as
to
any
land
from
nebraska
(inaudible)
to
iowa".
suppose
following
the
cession,
iowa
does
something
with
that
land.
let's
say
it
takes
it
for
a
public
purpose
just
as
it
would
take
for
the
iowa
land
of
its
citizens.
would
it
be
your
theory
that
you
could
come
in
to
this
court
and
say
that
because
the
titles
says
that
the
title
shall
be
good
in
iowa
as
to
any
lands
of
nebraska
they
cede
to
iowa
that
makes
out
a
case
of
violation
of
the
compact?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
compact
that
says
that?
unknown
speaker
i
would
say,
i
have
the
compact
and
your
complaint
and
all
it
seems
to
say
to
me
unless
there
is
some
long
history
to
the
contrary
is
that
there'll
be
a
good
title.
the
titles
of
that
land
will
be
recognized
and
it
will
be
treated
like
iowa
land
but
the
title
will
be
confirmed.
is
it
a
theory
that
nebraska
law
shall
--
should
probably
apply
to
that
land
in
terms
of
succession,
inheritance,
etcetera?
unknown
speaker
would
give
it
or
would
it
--
in
my
--
and
you
just
say
i'm
wrong
if
i
am
in
a
--
i'm
trying
to
construe
the
compact.
would
it
mean
really
that
what
this
compact
says
is
that
you
recognize
the
title
then
you
give
it
the
same
treatment
that
you
give
to
any
recognized
title,
the
land
in
your
state?
would
that
be
a
fair
construction
with
the
compact?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
it's
a
privilege
complaint
in
other
words.
unknown
speaker
well
that's
