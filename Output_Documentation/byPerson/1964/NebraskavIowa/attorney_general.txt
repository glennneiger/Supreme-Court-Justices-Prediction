mr.
mr.
attorney
general
honorable
chief
justice,
honorable
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
defendant,
state
of
iowa
contends
that
the
bill
of
complaint
by
the
state
of
nebraska
on
its
face
does
not
establish
the
existence
of
a
justiciable
controversy
between
the
state
of
nebraska
and
the
state
of
iowa
which
would
require
this
court
to
exercise
its
original
jurisdiction.
it
is
our
position
that
this
complaint
fails
in
all
respects
to
show
that
the
state
of
nebraska
is
the
real
party
in
interest
and
has
been
injured.
it
has
been
well
established
by
the
decisions
that
this
court
will
not
entertain
a
proceeding
on
original
jurisdiction
by
a
state
on
behalf
of
its
citizens
or
group
of
citizens
and
not
in
the
interest
of
the
state
itself.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
no
they
did
not
your
honor.
that's
correct.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
to
my
understanding,
this
is
the
first
time
that
this
precise
question
and
this
state
of
facts
as
made
up
by
the
complaint
and
the
answer
that
has
been
before
this
court
for
in
all
boundary
cases
where
this
court
has
assumed
jurisdiction,
there
has
either
been
a
question
of
the
validity
of
the
compact
or
as
to
the
location
whereas
in
this
instance
by
legislation
and
ratification
and
with
the
consent
of
the
congress,
the
boundary
was
established
and
we
feel
nothing
for
this
court
to
determine
in
that
respect.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
your
honor,
we
feel
that
first
of
all
by
virtue
of
nebraska
(inaudible)
law,
the
common
law
of
nebraska
invest
title
to
the
bed
of
the
stream
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
i
say
this
your
honor
for
the
reason
that
in
the
complaint
as
stated
by
the
state
of
nebraska,
they
are
asking
for
what
they
call
a
construction
of
section
3
apparently
of
the
iowa
and
nebraska
boundary
compact
which
merely
provides
that
the
state
of
iowa
will
recognize
those
titles
which
are
good
in
nebraska.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
of
course
we
say
that
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
i
would
assume
then
that
for
that
purpose,
if
assuming
that
the
complaint
is
true
in
that
respect,
just
for
the
purposes
of
arguing
jurisdiction.
i
would
be
ready
to
admit
that
the
state
of
nebraska
probably
does
have
at
least
maybe
or
not
a
litigious
interest
but
perhaps
a
governmental
interest.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
correct.
and
i
think
this
is
probably
born
out
by
the
first
boundary
dispute
between
iowa
and
nebraska
in
1892.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
not
entirely
because
i
think
if
we
could
examine
their
entire
complaint
and
the
matter
submitted
in
connection
there
with
that
we'll
find
out
that
there
are
not
facts
sufficiently
clear
and
presently
submitted
by
the
state
of
nebraska
to
warrant
invoking
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
in
connection
with
that
particular
allegation.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
if
there
were
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
i
would
say
that
is
correct,
the
mere
lack
of
ownership
in
the
land.
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
that
respect
with
--
in
the
case
of
nebraska
versus
iowa
decided
by
this
court
in
1892.
there
was
a
great
distinction
in
that.
at
that
time,
the
state
of
nebraska
law
was
the
--
identical
to
the
law
of
iowa
in
1906.
they
subsequently
changed
their
law
or
at
least
clarified
it
to
the
extent
that
it
invested
ownership
in
the
riparian
owner.
nebraska
versus
iowa
and
that
former
case
likewise
was
different
in
the
respect
that
there
was
no
compact.
there
was
a
question
of
course
both
states
then
followed
the
rule
of
the
thalweg.
the
boundary
line
was
established
as
the
thalweg
of
the
river,
the
deepest
part
of
the
main
channel.
the
question
of
an
oxbow
which
was
broken
off
placing
a
town
on
this
carter
lake
was
placed
on
the
nebraska
side
leaving
intact
this
same
identifiable
piece
of
land.
and
the
channel
of
the
missouri
river
remained
on
the
iowa
side.
and
this
court
held
that
because
of
the
fact
of
the
avulsion
that
the
boundary
line
between
the
states
did
not
changed.
and
accordingly,
it
remained
in
this
old
oxbow
on
the
nebraska
side
while
the
main
channel
of
the
river
ran
entirely
within
the
state
of
iowa.
this
oxbow
of
course
dried
up,
thus,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
town
of
carter
lake,
iowa
is
entirely
on
the
nebraska
side
and
has
been
for
years.
so
this
is
an
obvious
situation
where
the
river,
the
missouri
river
runs
entirely
through
the
state
of
iowa.
the
state
of
nebraska
has
no
interest
or
ownership
whatsoever
along
those
lines.
the
plaintiff
admits
in
paragraph
10,
page
11
of
his
motion,
that
the
state
of
nebraska
has
no
ownership
as
such
in
the
lands
and
controversy.
and
we
feel
that
in
arkansas
versus
texas
where
in
this
court,
in
allowing
the
motion
to
file
a
bill
of
complaint,
stated
at
page
82
of
98
law
edition,
the
contention
that
the
controversy
is
between
two
states
is
challenged
on
the
ground
that
the
injured
party
is
the
university
of
arkansas
which
does
not
stand
in
the
shoes
of
the
state.
arkansas
must
of
course,
represent
an
interest
of
her
own
and
not
merely
that
of
her
citizens
or
corporations.
the
court
went
on
to
find
that
the
particular
university
was
an
instrumentality
of
the
state
and
thus
concluded
that
there
was
and
actually
in
actuality
a
true
controversy.
but
this
court,
in
recognizing
and
allowing
the
motion
and
in
recognizing
that
a
true
controversy
did
in
fact
exist
and
pointed
out
the
conversed,
that
arkansas
as
nebraska
must
in
this
case,
represent
an
interest
of
her
own
and
not
merely
that
of
her
citizens
as
in
the
case
at
bar.
the
state
of
nebraska
has
pointed
out
that
the
iowa-nebraska
boundary
was
formerly
before
this
court
in
nebraska
versus
iowa
which
i
have
previously
discussed.
also,
in
that
particular
case
which
was
before
the
court,
the
question
of
jurisdiction
was
not
raised.
but
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
state
of
nebraska
has
failed
to
establish
that
this
suit
is
anything
but
one
instituted
on
behalf
of
its
own
citizens
and
accordingly
we
feel
jurisdiction
shouldn't
be
exercised.
we
further
submit
that
a
state
that
is
asking
permission
of
this
court
to
prevent
the
enforcement
and
exercise
of
the
duties
of
another
state,
they
must
allege
in
the
complaint
offered
for
filing
facts
that
are
clearly
sufficient
to
call
for
a
decree
in
its
favor.
this
court's
decisions
definitely
established
that
not
every
matter
of
submission
--
sufficient
moment
to
warrant
resort
to
equity
by
one
person
against
another
who
would
justify
an
interference
by
this
court
with
the
action
of
the
state.
in
missouri
versus
illinois,
this
court
upon
rule
--
overruling
a
demurrer
discussed
primarily
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
stated
that
200
u.s.,
page
578,
the
constitution
extends
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
to
controversies
between
two
or
more
states
and
between
a
state
and
citizens
of
another
state
and
gives
this
court
original
jurisdiction
in
cases
in
which
a
state
shall
be
a
party.
therefore,
if
one
state
raises
a
controversy
with
another,
this
court
must
determine
whether
there
is
any
principle
of
law
and
if
any,
what
on
which
the
plaintiff
can
recover.
but
the
fact
that
this
court
must
decide
does
not
mean
of
course,
that
it
takes
the
place
of
a
legislature.
some
principles,
it
must
have
power
to
declare.
for
instance,
when
there
a
dispute
arises
about
boundaries,
this
court
must
determine
the
line.
and
in
doing
so,
must
be
governed
by
rules
explicitly
or
implicitly
recognized.
we
submit
that
in
accord
with
this
particular
holding,
that
there
is
no
line
to
determine
that
the
line
was
determined
by
the
compact
between
the
states.
the
compact
of
1943
established
the
jurisdictional
boundary
between
the
state
of
nebraska
and
the
state
of
iowa.
it
is
--
has
been
and
can
be
accurately
located
by
surveyors.
its
self-evident,
it's
actually
a
matter
that
if
this
court
were
to
make
a
judicial
determination
as
to
where
the
boundary
is
or
if
the
legislature
is
to
do
it,
it
necessarily
requires
the
employment
of
a
surveyor
to
go
out
and
physically
locate
the
same.
thus
the
boundary
having
been
established
in
1943
between
the
state
of
nebraska
and
the
state
of
iowa
by
compact
placing
it
in
the
center
of
the
design
channel,
the
boundary
is
there.
it
only
must
be
physically
located.
this
court
can
do
nothing
more
to
determine
the
location
of
that
line.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
and
not
entirely.
i
intended
to
convey
that
the
lack
of
ownership
in
the
land
by
the
state
of
nebraska
as
an
--
as
a
sovereign
entity
precludes
it
from
having
any
interest
to
invoke
original
jurisdiction
as
to
the
location
of
the
boundary
line.
and
that
their
complaint
that
we
are
breaking
section
3
with
reference
to
the
titles
would
be
sufficient
to
circumvent
that
for
the
purposes
of
exercising
original
jurisdiction
by
this
court.
but
that
particular
complaint
will
be
negated
by
the
inconsistencies
and
the
evidentiary
matters
that
they
have
submitted
in
connection
with
their
motion.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
for
certain
purposes,
yes
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
then
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
i'm
saying
that
if
the
state
of
nebraska
were
the
owner
of
this
land,
then
the
only
court
that
could
hear
this
dispute
would
be
this
court
because
they
would
then
be
the
real
party
in
interest
without
question.
and
accordingly,
it
could
not
be
subjected
to
the
state
court
of
the
original
jurisdiction.
but
in
that
absence,
i'm
saying
for
them
to
raise
a
question
which
possibly
might
invoke
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
they
must
show
a
definite
breach
of
the
compact
or
a
proper
allegation
of
the
breach
where
they
have
only
made
a
proper
allegation
as
to
section
3
which
we
feel
will
be
negative.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
correct.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
we
claim
that
the
bill
of
complaint
in
of
itself
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
the
complaint
coupled
with
the
matters
submitted
with
it.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
i'm
saying
--
i
won't
say
both
your
honor.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
i
can't
say
that.
i
can
say
that
jurisdiction
should
not
be
exercised
because
there
hasn't
been
a
properly
alleged
breach.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
oh,
perhaps,
i
should
be
saying
that
the
court
does
have
jurisdiction
but
it
should
not
be
exercised
for
these
reasons.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
one
allegation.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
correct.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
there
are
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
we're
saying
that
the
compact
as
it's
written
is
clear
that
section
3
merely
says
that
the
state
of
iowa
as
well
as
the
state
of
nebraska
must
recognize
those
titles
which
are
good
in
their
respective
states.
and
this
admits
to
have
no
construction.
it
would
not
necessarily
employ
in
the
application
of
nebraska
principles
of
law.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
we're
saying
that
it's
an
evidentiary
question,
a
question
of
fact
as
to
where
this
landform
prior
to
the
compact
and
that
it
can
be
properly
resolved
in
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
whether
it'd
be
in
nebraska
court
or
the
iowa
court
depending
on
what
jurisdiction
lies
and
in
the
two
cases
about
which
they
specifically
complained
happen
to
be
in
the
iowa
jurisdiction.
now,
as
to
where
they
evolve,
it
is
only
proper
--
it's
an
evidentiary
question
when
the
land
formed,
well
--
where
the
thalweg
ran
prior
to
the
compact
to
establish
ownership.
and
accordingly,
nebraska
law
wouldn't
apply.
it's
a
question
of
fact.
it's
an
evidentiary
question
as
to
where
the
land
formed.
and
of
course
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
correct.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
correct.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
but
if
we
get
to
that
point,
of
course,
we're
at
the
merits.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
correct.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
it
is
our
contention
that
the
land
in
question
since
we
are
talking
about
merits,
formed
on
the
iowa
side
of
the
river
prior
to
the
compact,
has
always
remained
on
the
iowa
side
of
the
river.
no
intervening
avulsion
or
anything.
consequently,
it
accredited
to
the
bed
which
is
ownership
as
vested
in
the
state
of
iowa.
and
accordingly,
any
title
is
furious
and
fictitious.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
correct.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
in
every
instance,
i
suppose
you
might
say
that
the
compact
comes
into
existence
in
every
quiet
title
action
along
the
missouri
river
whether
it's
between
a
nebraskan
riparian
owner
and
another
nebraskan
on
the
nebraska
side
because
they
have
to
draw
that
legal
description
in
the
petition
to
the
center
of
the
proposed
stabilized
channel.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
correct.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
correct.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that
is
correct.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
coupled
with
the
matters
they've
submitted
in
their
brief
and
appendices.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
no,
no.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
certainly
cannot.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
that
if
you
examine
their
complaint
in
the
entirety
as
to
certain
things
that
i
shall
attempt
to
point
out
at
this
point,
that
perhaps
i
can
show
why
we'll
--
we
feel
that
it's
deficient
on
its
face
because
of
the
inconsistencies
and
some
of
the
absences
that
they
have
submitted.
first
of
all,
in
paragraph
14,
page
14
of
the
plaintiff's
motion,
the
plaintiff
of
state
of
nebraska
alleges
“approximately
the
westerly
50
feet
of
the
land
described
in
the
second
amendment
to
plaintiff's
petition
in
the
state
of
iowa
versus
babbitt
marked
exhibit
h
is
presently
in
the
state
of
nebraska
and
it's
west
of
the
center
line
of
the
proposed
stabilized
channel
of
the
missouri
river
as
established
by
the
alluvial
planes
maps,
referred
to
in
the
iowa-nebraska
boundary
compact.
this
allegation
has
succeeded
by
paragraph
20,
page
19
of
the
plaintiff's
motion
which
provides
impertinent
part.
the
problem
is
compounded
by
the
fact
that
the
alluvial
plane
maps
referred
to
in
the
iowa-nebraska
boundary
compact
are
of
too
small
a
scale,
(one
inch
equals
2640
feet)
and
do
not
contain
sufficient
detail
for
a
surveyor
to
accurately
locate
the
boundary
on
the
ground.
thus,
in
one
breath,
the
plaintiff
alleges
that
we're
transcending
the
boundary
by
50
feet
and
then
the
next
states,
it
can't
be
located.
then
plaintiff
in
an
attempt
to
explain
this
inconsistency
states
on
pages
2
and
3
of
its
supplemental
brief.
iowa
has
clearly
misread
the
latter
paragraph
because
paragraph
20
does
not
state
that
it
is
impossible
in
all
areas
to
locate
the
boundary.
that
states
that
it
is
not
possible
in
many
areas
to
locate
the
center
line
of
the
proposed
stabilized
channel
of
the
missouri
river
within
the
meaning
of
the
1943
compact
on
the
ground
for
maps
presently
on
file
in
the
office
of
the
united
states
army
corps
of
engineers.
these
allegations
are
not
inconsistent.
then
plaintiff
asserts
on
9
and
10
of
its
supplemental
brief.
the
first
paragraph
towards
the
bottom
about
eight
lines
up,
this
would
apparently
create
an
artificial
line
as
the
new
boundary
rather
than
the
moving
river
boundary
which
was
subject
to
change.
the
language
middle
of
the
main
channel
as
used
in
the
compact
would
seem
to
be
aligned
on
the
applicable
maps
equal
distance
--
distant
from
each
bank
of
the
proposed
stabilized
channel
or
the
design
channel.
since
the
deepest
part
of
the
main
channel
of
the
missouri
river,
when
it
constituted
the
boundary
previously,
varied
from
shore
to
shore,
it
would
seem
that
the
compact
resulted
in
the
creation
of
a
new
boundary
at
almost
every
place
along
the
entire
border
between
iowa
and
nebraska.
in
light
of
this,
it
is
difficult
to
understand
how
iowa
can
take
the
position
that
the
compact
is
completely
irrelevant
to
the
actions
which
it
is
bringing
particularly
since
in
some
of
the
actions,
iowa
surveys
disregard
the
tread
of
a
stream
and
run
to
the
so-called
middle
of
the
designed
channel
or
at
least
to
what
we
would
suppose
iowa
considers
to
be
the
so-called
middle
of
the
designed
channel.
thus
we
find
at
this
point
the
state
of
the
missouri
river,
first,
we're
over
the
boundary
by
50
feet,
second,
it
can't
be
located,
third,
it
can't
be
located
in
all
areas.
and
then
we
are
errant
because
our
surveys
disregard
the
tread
of
the
stream
and
run
to
the
center
of
the
designed
channel
which
is
the
compact
of
1943,
the
center
of
the
design
channel.
to
this
last
assertion,
we
admit
our
surveys
run
to
the
center
of
the
design
channel
of
missouri
river.
this
is
the
precise
language
contained
in
the
1943
compact.
thus,
in
this
instance,
we
are
saying
that
from
a
accumulative
standpoint,
their
assertions
of
fact
clearly
do
not
call
for
a
decree
in
the
nebraska's
favor.
and
on
the
contrary
plans
last
assertion
that
were
running
to
the
center
of
the
designed
channel,
exonerates
the
state
of
iowa
from
improperly
locating
the
boundary.
examining
the
allegation
that
iowa
is
unilaterally
advocating
the
compact
by
its
actions
inquiring
title,
we
find
this
to
support
plaintiff's
allegation
in
the
case
of
state
versus
babbitt.
first,
the
state
of
iowa
has
according
to
nebraska
in
that
case,
exceeded
the
boundary
by
50
feet.
secondly,
they
turn
to
the
interrogatories
posed
by
the
state
of
iowa
in
that
case
submitted
as
an
appendix
by
nebraska
and
the
answer
to
certain
of
those
interrogatories
carried
on
page
53
and
62
of
plaintiff's
motions
--
motion
respectively.
commencing
with
interrogatory
11,
was
any
part
of
the
land
above
ordinary
high-water
mark
and
contained
within
plaintiff's
metes
and
bounds
description
in
plaintiff's
second
amendment
to
petition
formed
by
accretion.
that's
the
land
where
we're
supposed
to
be
over
the
boundary
by
50
feet.
if
so,
when
did
such
accretions
first
arise
above
ordinary
high-water
mark?
and
in
what
state
did
the
same
first
arise
above
ordinary
high-water
mark?
answer:
answering
interrogatory
11,
these
dependent
states
that
it
is
impossible
at
this
time
to
determine
the
answer
to
this
question
for
the
reason
that
these
dependents
have
not
been
furnished
with
a
proper
map,
plot
or
survey,
showing
the
area
contained
with
plaintiff's
metes
and
bounds
description
in
plaintiff's
second
amendment
to
petition.
interrogatory
12
is
any
part
of
the
land
in
controversy,
the
same
original
identical
land
which
was
included
in
either
the
original
iowa
survey
or
the
area
--
of
the
area
made
in
1851
and
1852,
or
in
the
original
nebraska's
territorial
survey
made
in
the
area
in
1856.
if
so,
which
survey
included
it
and
what
part
of
the
land
in
controversy
was
so
included?
answer:
same
answer
as
given
to
interrogatory
11.
interrogatory
13,
did
any
part
of
the
land
in
controversy
come
in
to
existence
by
accretion.
and
if
so,
when
did
such
accretions
formed?
in
what
state
did
they
form?
and
to
what
did
they
accrete?
answer:
same
answer
as
interrogatory
11.
if
you
have
--
interrogatory
14,
if
you
have
answered
the
preceding
interrogatory
in
the
affirmative
state,
who
was
the
owner
or
who
were
the
owners
of
the
river
bed
or
riparian
lands
to
which
the
land
in
controversy
accreted?
answer:
the
same
answer
as
interrogatory
11.
interrogatory
15,
if
you
have
stated
and
answered
to
any
foregoing
interrogatories
that
any
part
of
the
land
in
controversy
in
this
case
was
in
existence
prior
to
1920,
state
by
what
means
or
method
you
now
identify
that
part
of
the
land
in
controversy
as
being
the
same
identical
land?
and
lastly,
interrogatory
17,
has
the
thalweg
of
the
missouri
river
ever
flowed
to
the
east
of
the
area
described
in
plaintiff's
second
amendment
to
petition
or
to
the
east
of
any
part
thereof
which
would
be
the
iowa
bank
or
to
the
east
of
any
of
the
same
identical
land
which
now
exist
in
the
area
above
ordinary
high-water
mark.
and
if
so,
when
did
the
thalweg
of
the
missouri
river
so
flow
and
for
what
period
of
time
or
periods
of
time?
thus,
the
matter
submitted
in
connection
with
the
plaintiff's
motion
in
support
demonstrates
probably
that
the
facts
asserted
clearly
do
not
call
for
a
decree
in
its
favor.
it
creates
a
paradox
for
nebraska
asserts
that
we
are
unilaterally
abrogating
the
compact
in
this
particular
case.
ownership
which
can
only
be
established
by
the
principles
of
law
and
the
origin
of
the
land
in
question
which
the
real
parties
in
interest
provide
by
answering,
they
don't
have
the
proper
maps
and
plots
to
provide
us
with
this
information.
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
deficiency
does
not
warrant
invoking
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
the
state
of
iowa
or
state
of
nebraska
takes
issue
at
the
state
of
iowa
in
our
position
concerning
the
importance
of
the
origin
and
formation
of
the
river
lands
relative
to
ascertaining
ownership.
we
submit
that
this
is
the
only
question,
the
precise
question,
and
it
is
the
sole
question
in
determining
ownership
of
riparian
lands.
inviting
your
attention
to
the
first
paragraph
on
page
28
and
concluding
on
page
29
of
plaintiff's
supplemental
brief,
the
state
of
nebraska
in
substance
makes
--
takes
issue
with
iowa's
theory.
and
if
the
court
will
clearly
examine
the
legal
conclusions
that
are
discussed
therein
and
examine
the
fact
that
nebraska
calls
this
our
present
theory,
you
will
find
that
it
is
--
this
is
not
the
theory.
you
could
have
nothing
but
a
flexible
boundary.
we
would
have
the
thalweg
rule.
the
boundary
was
established
in
1943.
it
was
determined.
there
is
nothing
to
determine.
it
has
to
be
located
physically,
yes.
it
would
have
to
be
physically
ascertained
if
this
court
made
a
judicial
determination
as
to
where
it
was.
the
last
sentence
after
discussing
iowa's
theory,
it
says,
this
would
seem
to
create
a
state
of
utter
confusion
along
the
missouri
river
and
one
in
need
of
a
solution.
this
is
entirely
true.
for
in
many
instances,
the
river
now
runs
entirely
within
the
state
of
nebraska
or
entirely
within
the
state
of
iowa.
it
has
left
a
stabilized
channel.
and
the
boundary
in
many
instances
runs
over
dry
lands.
but
the
only
solution
can
be
by
mutual
legislative
action
of
the
respective
legislators
and
the
consent
of
congress.
the
boundary
was
fixed.
it
cannot
be
changed.
and
the
fact
that
the
river
may
in
some
instances
lie
with
--
entirely
within
the
state
of
iowa,
is
a
problem
that
must
be
dealt
with
in
the
respective
courts
having
jurisdiction
on
each
individual
case
basis.
a
excellent
example
is
in
appendix
a
of
our
brief
in
argument
in
opposition
to
the
moment
--
motion.
in
that
instance,
dartmouth
college,
draining
its
title
through
a
nebraskan
riparian
owner,
sued
another
nebraskan
who
was
an
adverse
possessor
in
iowa
courts
over
land
lying
in
iowa
by
virtue
of
the
compact
but
situated
on
the
right
bank
or
the
nebraska
side
of
the
river.
the
state
of
iowa
intervened
and
our
contention
was
that
the
land
formed
on
the
iowa
side
and
that
there
was
an
avulsion
in
1937.
and
accordingly,
the
boundary
did
not
change.
the
trial
court
disagreed
with
us.
he
held
there
was
no
avulsion
and
that
the
river
gradually
shifted
to
the
left
bank
of
the
iowa
side.
and
accordingly,
the
boundary
--
then
boundary
in
‘37
followed
it.
and
it
became
accretion
to
the
nebraskan
riparian
owner.
this
is
a
hazard
of
owning
land,
riparian
land.
you
gain
some,
you
lose
some.
now
in
this
instance,
the
missouri
river
was
then
put
entirely
through
the
center
of
this
island,
the
proposed
stabilized
channel.
and
the
boundary
was
sent
right
through
the
center
of
this
island.
and
they
blocked
the
shoot
on
the
iowa
side.
they
put
the
boundary
through
the
center
of
this
island.
then
the
shoot
broke.
the
revetments
by
the
corps
and
the
river
refused
to
go
through
the
center
of
this
island.
the
nebraska
shoot
dried
up
and
the
land
became
contiguous
with
the
nebraska
side
of
the
river.
but
by
virtue
of
the
‘43
boundary
compact,
half
of
it
is
in
the
state
of
iowa.
that
was
a
precise
reason
that
dartmouth
college
sued
gerald
rose
in
our
courts
to
quiet
his
title.
and
yet,
it's
on
the
westerly
side
of
the
river.
and
now,
being
a
property
owner
for
a
certain
instance
in
the
state
of
iowa,
he
no
longer
has
the
right
to
accrete
along
the
bed
of
the
streams
for
he
is
now
an
iowa
owner.
and
he
must
--
this
land
now
must
be
governed
by
iowa
laws
and
the
state
owns
the
bed
of
the
stream.
but
downstream
where
the
river
comes
back
where
it
used
to
be
and
he's
a
nebraska
riparian
owner.
he
can
accrete
to
the
center
of
the
channel.
now
this
is
a
situation
of
--
apparently,
nebraska
feels
that
this
isn't
the
state
of
the
law
and
says
it's
a
need
of
a
solution.
this
we
submit
gentleman
is
the
law
and
is
in
need
of
a
solution
but
can
only
be
sent
by
a
new
boundary
compact.
finally,
it
is
our
position
that
it
is
clear
that
nebraska's
complaint
about
two
specific
cases
which
have
not
--
the
individuals
who
are
the
alleged
owners
have
not
been
made
parties
to
this
litigation.
we
submit
that
although
this
court
has
jurisdiction,
original
but
not
exclusive
over
a
controversy
between
a
state
and
citizens
of
another
state
it
cannot
be
exercise
in
their
absence.
and
that
this
particular
action
filed
by
the
state
of
nebraska
should
be
dismissed
for
the
want
of
indispensable
party's
litigant.
this
court
has
held
repeatedly
in
for
--
in
minnesota
versus
northern
securities
company,
an
original
suit
in
this
court
wherein
the
motion
was
denied
because
of
the
absence
of
indispensable
parties.
this
court
stated
at
184
u.s.
234
and
235,
the
general
rule
in
equity
is
that
all
persons
materially
interested
either
legally
or
beneficially
in
the
subject
matter
of
a
suit
are
to
be
made
parties
to
it
so
there
be
may
a
complete
decree
which
shall
bind
them
all.
it
is
clear
and
it
is
admitted
by
the
state
of
iowa
that
the
specific
parties,
henry
e.
schemmel
and
darwin
merritt
babbitt
are
not
made
parties
to
the
state
of
iowa
or
to
this
particular
action
and
do
in
fact
claim
ownership
in
the
lands
in
controversy.
nebraska,
the
plaintiff
in
this
action,
concedes
or
contends
that
they
are
in
fact
the
owners
accordingly.
a
binding
adjudication
cannot
be
made
by
this
court
affecting
their
rights
and
in
their
absence.
the
authorities
that
the
plaintiff
relies
upon,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
all
involved
either
the
question
of
where
the
boundary
was
since
it
had
not
been
determined
or
the
validity
of
the
agreement
that
it
established
a
compact
between
the
states.
but
in
this
case,
the
boundary
has
been
determined
by
our
mutual
legislatures.
our
plaintiff
also
mentioned
durfee
versus
duke
which
he
points
out
is
a
deformable
situation.
and
i
think
you'll
find
that
this
decision
is
illustrative
of
the
indispensability
of
mr.
schemmel
or
mr.
babbitt
in
order
for
res
judicata
to
apply.
in
that
situation,
the
parties
were
before
the
court.
the
plaintiff
has
further
asked
in
his
brief
where
a
statement
destroying
the
presumption
set
down
by
the
iowa
courts
in
kittredge
versus
ritter,
172
iowa
55.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
that's
a
1915
case
and
that
was
one
of
course
we
followed
the
rule
of
the
thalweg.
and
it's
normal
that
a
presumption
would
occur
that
if
land
is
on
one
side
of
the
river,
it
would
be
a
natural
presumption
that
it
is
in
the
state
of
the
--
that
it
is
nearest
to.
because
there
is
a
presumption
that
in
fact
and
in
law
against
an
avulsion
of
carrying
--
occurring
as
opposed
to
the
election
in
the
normal
processes
of
accretion.
accordingly,
his
request
that
this
presumption
in
iowa
should
be
struck
down
like
i
pointed
out,
it
was
a
1915
case
and
prior
to
the
43
compact.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
motion
should
be
denied
and
that
the
state
of
iowa
be
given
the
opportunity
to
proceed
in
courts
of
competent
jurisdiction
to
ascertain
ownership
to
land
much
in
the
same
way
that
the
state
of
nebraska
brings
actions
in
its
courts.
i
think
it
might
--
it
is
interesting
to
point
out
in
the
intervener's
brief
who
is
of
course
not
before
the
court,
his
permission
having
been
denied,
he
points
out
a
situation
in
nebraska
wherein
he
was
a
party
litigant
and
claimed
title
to
these
lands
in
nebraska
courts
by
virtue
of
an
iowa
harrison
county
judgment.
he
claims
that
they
didn't
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
this
particular
decree.
the
court,
the
nebraska
court,
found
in
that
particular
case,
i
believe
the
caption
is
schrader,
schroeder
versus
homestead
et
al,
1961
case.
and
the
nebraska
court
found
that
the
land
was
never
in
iowa
and
accordingly
the
title
was
no
good.
we
submit
that
this
is
the
only
question
before
the
court
and
it
should
be
before
the
lower
court
and
not
this
court.
thank
you.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
i
think
in
any
event
because
of
the
absence
of
mr.
schemmel
and
mr.
babbitt
that
there
is
nothing
in
adjudication
at
this
point
would
certainly
be
of
no
value
or
benefit
whatsoever.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
then
i
certainly
don't
think
that
there's
anything
of
moment
before
this
court
because
it
will
resolve
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
i
say
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
that's
correct.
you
have
jurisdiction
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
correct.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
it
is
not,
i
don't
think
as
i
recall
a
decision
of
this
court
for
this
court
to
determine
or
the
responsibility
is
not
upon
this
court
to
make
parties
to
it
or
form
up
the
makeup
of
the
particular
lawsuit.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
i
think
that
--
i
think
this
if
mr.
schemmel
and
mr.
babbitt
were
before
this
court
that
a
determination
could
be
made
at
the
state
of
iowa
respecting
this
land.
but
i
think
in
the
absence
of
their
presence
that
if
they
--
an
adjudication
was
made
and
assuming
that
the
evidence
showed
that
iowa
was
correct
in
its
evidentiary
theory,
could
it
be
said
that
it
would
operate
with
justice
on
mr.
schemmel
and
mr.
babbitt?
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
as
i
said
earlier,
i
don't
feel
that
i
think
they
do
have
the
right
to
determine
but
i
don't
think
their
complaint
that
it's
entirely
based
upon
what
they
have
submitted
in
connection
therewith
demonstrates
clear
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
i
think
i
would
answer
that
yes.
thank
you.
