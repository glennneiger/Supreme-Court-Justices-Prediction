mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
to
be
argued
today
in
this
matter
is
whether
this
court
is
to
take
jurisdiction
of
an
original
action
by
the
state
of
nebraska
against
the
state
of
iowa
to
construe
and
enforce
the
iowa
and
nebraska
boundary
compact
of
1943.
the
--
a
motion
for
leave
to
file
a
bill
of
complaint
has
been
filed
with
this
court
to
which
was
attached
to
the
complaint.iowa
has
indicated
opposition
to
this
motion
on
briefs
on
file.
in
1892,
this
court
decided
that
the
missouri
river
boundary
between
iowa
and
nebraska
was
the
middle
of
the
main
channel
of
the
missouri
river.
and
that
in
spite
of
the
rapidity
of
the
changes
of
the
missouri
river
caused
by
the
velocity
of
the
current
that
the
normal
principles
of
the
law
of
accretion
and
avulsion
applied
to
the
missouri
and
that
this
boundary
move
where
the
changes
of
the
channel
were
gradual
or
imperceptible
by
the
process
known
as
accretion
or
reliction
but
that
where
the
river
suddenly
abandoned
its
bank
and
sought
a
new
bed
by
the
process
known
as
avulsion,
the
boundary
did
not
move
but
remained
in
the
abandoned
channel.
during
the
years
that
followed
that
decision
of
this
court,
there
were
many
changes,
natural
changes
in
the
missouri
river
and
the
flooding
was
very
great.
so
in
the
1930s,
the
united
states
army
corps
of
engineers
embarked
upon
a
program
with
channel
stabilization.
and
they
commenced
to
divert
the
river
into
a
new
and
stabilized
channel
which
has
been
referred
to
as
a
design
channel.
they
did
this
by
the
construction
of
dikes
and
revetments
and
by
dredging
operations.
well,
as
a
result
of
all
these
natural
changes,
as
a
result
of
the
action
by
the
corps
of
engineers
much
land
which
had
been
in
the
state
of
nebraska
found
itself
placed
on
the
easterly
or
iowa
side
of
the
river,
much
land
which
had
been
in
the
state
of
iowa
found
itself
placed
on
the
westerly
or
the
nebraska
side
of
the
missouri
river
and
there
was
a
great
deal
of
uncertainty
and
friction
which
resulted
as
to
where
this
land
was.
so
because
of
this
uncertainty
and
this
friction,
the
states
in
the
early
1940s
entered
into
the
negotiations.
and
in
1943,
both
states
entered
into
the
iowa-nebraska
boundary
compact
which
was
duly
ratified
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
and
this
compact
did
several
things.
after
accepting
an
area
known
as
carter
lake,
iowa
by
metes
and
bounds
description
which
was
left
in
nebraska
by
avulsion
in
1877,
the
compact
set
the
new
line
between
iowa
and
nebraska
and
defined
it
as
the
center
line
of
the
proposed
stabilized
channel
of
the
missouri
river
as
established
by
maps
on
file
with
the
u.s.
army
corps
of
engineers
in
which
maps
were
then
subsequently
filed
with
the
secretary's
of
the
state
of
the
two
states.
and
the
compact
went
on
and
it
provided
that
iowa
ceded
and
relinquish
jurisdiction
of
all
lands
now
in
iowa
but
lying
westerly
of
said
boundary
line
to
nebraska
and
nebraska
ceded
jurisdiction
over
all
lands
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
to
the
state
of
iowa.
at
that
time,
when
they
determined
this
new
line,
the
states
didn't
take
any
action
to
specifically
identify
the
land.
in
fact,
we've
been
informed
that
it
was
too
expensive
of
a
job
at
that
time
and
they
didn't
want
to
make
all
these
difficult
determinations
which
couldn't
be
made
without
litigation
and
without
a
great
deal
of
expenditure
funds.
they
also
didn't
provide
any
procedure
for
describing
land
which
had
been
placed
--
which
had
been
in
one
state
and
was
thereby
ceded
to
the
other
by
the
different
metes
and
bounds
descriptions
of
the
different
regions
or
range
lines
which
were
applicable
to
land
in
that
other
state.
the
compact
didn't
stop
there
with
just
setting
a
line.
it
continued
and
this
is
cited
at
pages
26
and
30
of
our
complaint,
to
provide
the
titles,
mortgages,
and
other
liens
good
in
nebraska,
shall
be
good
in
iowa
as
to
any
lands
which
nebraska
may
cede
to
iowa
in
any
pending
suits
or
actions
which
concerns
said
lands
maybe
prosecuted
to
final
judgment
in
nebraska
and
such
judgment
shall
be
accorded
full
force
in
fact
in
iowa.
the
compact
went
one
step
further
and
provided
for
the
collection
of
taxes
on
lands
which
had
been
ceded
to
the
other
state
by
the
original
ceding
state
for
the
year
of
the
compact.
and
then
it
went
on
and
provided
a
five-year
limitation
and
stated
that
all
liens
or
other
rights
accrued
or
accruing
as
aforesaid
in
this
tax
provision
shall
be
claimed
or
asserted
within
five
years
or
be
forever
barred.
in
fact
as
it
turned
out
the
channel
wasn't
stabilized
and
everyone
thought
it
was
at
that
time,
the
corps
of
engineers
changed
its
plans.
the
channel
or
river
broke
through
in
many
places.
some
of
the
maps
were
destroyed.
but
for
many
years,
it
appeared
that
this
compact
had
solved
the
boundary
problems
between
iowa
and
nebraska.
and
nebraska
citizens
continued
in
their
peaceful
possession
of
this
land,
they
improved
it,
they
cleared
it.
and
because
of
the
stabilization
of
the
river,
the
land
which
was
really
rich
bottom
land
became
highly
productive
farmland.
this
period
of
peace
and
tranquility
which
lasted
until
the
early
60s
was
suddenly
broken
by
announcement
by
the
state
conservation
commission
of
the
state
of
iowa
that
the
state
was
planning
to
attempt
to
acquire
a
great
deal
of
land
--
title
to
potential
recreational
sites
along
the
missouri
river.
on
january
1
of
1961,
the
conservation
commission
published
a
document
known
as
part
1
of
the
missouri
river
planning
report.
and
this
listed
approximately
25
areas
which
contained
--
or
15,000
acres
of
land
somewhere
on
the
iowa
side
of
the
river
as
it
presently
exist
somewhere
on
the
nebraska
side.
and
the
com
--
the
planning
report
indicated
that
there
maybe
some
more
changes
because
we're
not
quite
sure
in
some
areas
what
the
corps
of
engineers
is
going
to
do
and
their
action
may
affect
whether
or
not
we
think
we
can
acquire
some
more
land.
the
theory
which
iowa
seem
to
be
following
was
the
iowa
rule
of
law,
of
common
law
at
least,
that
the
state
owns
title
to
the
beds
of
navigable
streams.
and
this
had
been
followed
by
the
iowa
supreme
court
for
many
years.
this
differs
from
the
nebraska
law
and
that
in
nebraska
the
beds
of
navigable
streams
belong
to
the
riparian
owners
but
subject
to
the
easement
of
public
navigation
in
the
streams.
the
state
of
iowa
then
proceeded
to
implement
this
program
by
filing
some
lawsuits
against
some
of
these
landowners
which
had
owned
nebraska
land
and
had
been
nebraska
residents.
and
this
caused
a
great
deal
of
concern
to
the
state
of
nebraska
because
nebraska
felt
that
it
had
by
the
compact
placed
these
lands
within
the
jurisdiction
of
iowa
by
entering
into
a
new
boundary
line.
but
in
doing
so,
it
didn't
do
this
unequivocally,
it
extracted
certain
guarantees
from
the
state
of
iowa,
guarantees
which
were
essential
to
the
existence
of
this
compact.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
your
honor,
the
line
was
defined
in
the
compact
as
the
middle
of
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
--
the
main
channel
as
it
existed
on
these
maps.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
i
think
it's
our
position
that
this
created
an
artificial
line
but
it
is
a
little
difficult
to
tell
in
many
places
where
this
line
is
because
the
maps
which
were
on
file
and
referred
to
had
a
scale
of
one
inch
equals
to
2640
feet.
the
corps
of
engineers
at
that
same
time
had
many
maps
which
were
the
same
as
the
alluvial
plain
maps
but
with
a
much
larger
scale,
an
inch
equals
400
feet.
we've
been
informed
since
that
time
that
many
of
these
one
inch
equals
400
foot
maps
have
been
destroyed.
and
these
were
maps
which
surveyors
used
as
a
practical
matter
because
we've
been
informed
that
in
many
places
where
these
maps
were
destroyed
is
impossible
under
the
original
maps
that
laid
the
boundary
out
on
the
ground
as
it
exist.
so
we
have
a
description
of
a
boundary.
now
then
there
were
many
river
changes
since
that
time.
the
river
broke
out
of
its
bank
and
again,
there's
never
been
any
definitive
decision
which
would
define
in
those
places
where
this
boundary
is
at
the
present
time.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
there
is
not
your
honor
except
as
to
50
feet.
we
have
mentioned
in
our
petition
two
particular
situations
in
our
complaint,
two
particular
situations
where
iowa
is
claiming
land.
in
the
one
case,
it's
clear
that
the
land
is
in
--
presently
in
the
jurisdiction
of
iowa
if
the
compact
is
a
valid
compact.
we're
not
questioning
the
validity
of
it.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
in
the
other
case,
the
land
is
with
the
exception
of
the
westerly
50
feet.
and
our
state
surveyors
has
examined
this
very
carefully
and
has
informed
us
that
the
westerly
50
feet
of
this
land
which
iowa
is
--
has
described
in
its
petition
in
its
state
court
is
in
nebraska
at
the
present
time
and
is
westerly
of
the
center
of
the
stabilized
channel
as
it
was
defined
by
the
boundary
compact.
so
there
maybe
a
real
question
between
the
states
as
to
what
the
compact
meant
or
where
the
line
is
as
a
practical
matter
within
the
language
of
the
compact.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
as
to
that
50
feet
particularly
and
we
think
that
the
fact
that
they
have
taken
that
position
is
indicative
of
--
of
course,
iowa's
entire
approach
to
the
compact
because
we'll
go
into
our
contentions
as
to
iowa's
unilateral
approach
towards
this
--
towards
the
interpretation
of
this
compact.
there's
only
that
50
feet
right
now
that
iowa
has
claimed
that
we're
aware
of
which
we
feel
is
in
nebraska.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
this
is
our
contention
your
honor,
yes.
and
you
see
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
your
honor,
it
is
our
contention
that
when
we
entered
into
this
compact,
we
didn't
unequivocally
cede
the
land
to
the
state
of
iowa
or
place
it
in
iowa's
jurisdiction.
we
only
did
so
subject
to
some
safeguards
which
were
placed
in
the
compact.
and
our
theory
really
is
that
this
compact
is
a
contract
between
the
states.
and
as
such
it's
binding
on
the
states
not
just
their
judiciary
but
it's
binding
on
the
states
themselves.
and
that
the
state
of
iowa
by
instituting
these
quiet
actions
is
not
recognizing
these
titles
to
this
land
which
is
ceded.
they're
making
a
unilateral
determination
of
what
the
meaning
of
the
compact
is.
and
we
don't
think
that
when
two
states
enter
in
an
agreement
such
as
a
compact,
we
think
that
one
state
should
be
able
to
enforce
the
terms
of
that
compact,
whatever
they
are.
this
matter
seemed
to
be
of
great
interest
to
the
states
or
they
wouldn't
have
put
in
provisions
which
were
designed
to
settle
the
controversy
at
least
as
between
the
states
and
landowners
along
the
river
and
design
to
settle
the
boundary.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
your
honor,
they
say
this
is
true
but
our
answer
is
and
our
contention
is
that
these
provisions
to
safeguard
titles
were
put
there
for
a
purpose.
and
that
iowa
by
taking
that
position
is
saying
you
have
to
try
your
title
in
our
courts
with
us,
the
state
as
a
party.
and
we
think
that
because
of
the
result
of
that
situation
and
the
unfairness
which
seems
to
result
from
that
situation
that
we
should
be
able
to
have
the
determination
here.
for
instance,
to
illustrate
the
unfairness
which
may
result.
first
in
1943,
the
states
refused
to
define
where
the
boundary
was.
the
states
wouldn't
take
it
upon
themselves
to
decide
these
things.
it
doesn't
seem
fair
that
now,
20
years
later,
a
landowner
has
to
come
in
himself
and
make
that
very
difficult
factual
determination
of
where
the
boundary
is.
it's
a
burden
cast
upon
an
individual
farmer
which
we
don't
think
it's
fair
to
cast
upon
him.
now,
if
we
have
decided
where
the
boundary
was,
that
would
have
been
another
matter.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
but
this
is
different
your
honor
because
these
citizens
are
placed
in
this
predicament
clearly
because
of
the
boundary
compact.
if
it
hadn't
been
for
the
boundary
compact,
we'd
have
an
entirely
different
situation.
but
we
have
an
area
where
there
was
a
clear
question
as
to
jurisdiction
of
the
courts.
and
we
might
have
a
situation
resulting
as
such
as
this
court
considered
in
durfee
versus
duke
a
year
ago
last
december
where
a
district
court
in
one
case
said
the
land
is
here
and
the
court
in
another
state
said
we
find
the
land
is
located
here.
in
that
sort
of
situation,
if
iowa
brought
a
quiet
title
action
and
the
individual
landowner
didn't
appear
at
all
and
ignored
it,
he
could
go
to
nebraska
and
bring
his
quiet
title
action
and
iowa
is
claiming
and
the
nebraska
individuals
claiming
that
he
get
his
share
if
iowa
comes
in
and
who
knows
what
happens.
but
at
least,
he
might
not
have
been
deprived
of
his
rights
by
that
iowa
quiet
title
action
in
that
iowa
court.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
your
honor,
i
would
say
it
is
more
a
suit
to
determine
the
meaning
and
to
enforce
the
compact
with
regard
to
boundary.
this
is
really
the
crux
of
it.
we've
got
many
other
incidental
problems
along
the
boundary
because
there's
much
land
which
is
in
question
now.
it
would
be
hoped
that
someday
the
states
could
settle
this
problem
by
compact
but
this
is
important
to
nebraska
because
if
nebraska
can't
guarantee
that
the
rights
of
its
citizens
will
be
protected
once
a
compact
is
entered
into
it.
and
if
nebraska
can
enter
into
provisions
which
can
be
enforced
by
nebraska,
i
doubt
that
the
state
would
ever
be
interested
in
entering
into
a
compact.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
well,
i
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
no
your
honor.
this
is
more
intended
to
show
the
background
and
the
history
behind
the
compact
because
we
think
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
--
that
this
is
important
in
determining
what
the
compact
meant
at
the
time
that
it
was
entered
into.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
not
between
the
states
your
honor.
the
only
thing
that
can
happen
is
nebraska
i
supposed
--
these
states
were
pending
when
this
was
brought
to
nebraska's
attention
in
the
iowa
court.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
well,
but
you
see
your
honor,
these
people
were
placed
in
this
position
by
the
compact.
and
we
contend
that
we
put
them
there.
we
put
them
there
by
our
agreement
with
iowa.
and
we
think
that
when
iowa
entered
into
a
compact
with
us,
that
they
thereby
accepted
and
relinquished
jurisdiction
over
much
of
this
land
which
had
been
taxed
in
nebraska,
which
had
quiet
title
actions
in
nebraska,
which
was
occupied
by
nebraska
residents
all
during
this
period
of
time.
what
happens
as
a
practical
matter
is
that
the
iowa
court
say,
“you
are
here,
we
apply
iowa
law.
the
compact
has
no
bearing.
it's
strictly
a
matter
of
where
the
land
formed”.
now
if
this
is
so,
we
think
that
it
takes
a
determination
by
this
court
with
the
states
before
it
that
this
is
the
meaning
of
the
compact
because
we
are
automatically
--
if
the
court
refuses
jurisdiction,
we
are
bound
by
iowa's
construction
that
they're
entitled
to
go
ahead
with
this
program.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
we
feel
your
honor
that
this
court
could
determine
and
if
it
would
consider
the
two
factual
situations
which
we
have
alleged,
that
a
determination
of
those
factual
situations
would
also
determine
the
meaning
and
the
intent
of
the
compact
and
that
this
would
be
a
broad
enough
decision
that
hopefully
it
would
either
discourage
iowa
from
proceeding
with
other
actions
or
would
given
up
guidelines
that
we
could
be
able
to
determine
ourselves
in
what
situations
they
could
proceed
and
what
they
couldn't.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
well,
no
because
we've
got
factual
situation
you
see.
it's
in
--
it's
the
same
as
any
case
when
you
have
one
factual
situation
perhaps
the
doctrine
of
law
which
is
stated
there
might
be
applicable
to
many
other
areas.
what
this
court
did
in
1892
and
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
do
it
again
but
originally,
they
gave
a
decision
as
to
the
normal
principles
of
law
which
applied
to
missouri.
then
the
parties
got
together
with
the
court's
suggestion
and
entered
into
a
decree
whereby
they
set
their
boundary
but
the
court
first
said
these
are
the
principles
of
law
which
apply.
we
don't
have
--
i
don't
--
we
don't
ask
the
court
for
an
advisory
opinion
because
we
don't
feel
we
have
that
right.
but
we
do
ask
for
a
construction
of
the
meaning
and
intent
of
this
compact
as
between
the
states.
we
want
to
know
what
iowa
agreed
to
do
as
to
us.
we
think
we're
entitled
to
know
that.
and
if
they
don't
live
up
to
their
agreement
with
us,
we
think
we're
entitled
to
enforce
it
just
as
in
any
contract
where
someone
insists
upon
the
insertion
of
a
provision.
the
other
party
breaches
it.
we
think
there's
something
to
be
determined
here
and
of
course,
all
we're
asking
is
our
--
the
right
to
have
these
facts
heard.
we
think
we're
right.
we
think
they
are
breaching
the
compact
and
we
have
alleged
distinct
violations
of
the
compact.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
we
don't
know
where
else
to
go.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
our
answer
is
your
honor
that
we
had
an
interest
to
enter
into
the
compact
in
the
first
place.
we
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
but
we
didn't
say
that
because
we
said,
we
are
only
ceding
this
to
you
on
these
conditions.
it
didn't
--
and
iowa
itself
in
its
adoption
or
enactment
of
the
compact
provisions
insisted
that
the
nebraska
law
contain
these
identical
provisions
for
the
protection
of
the
landowners.
so
that
creates
our
interest.
we
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
we
feel
it
is
your
honor.
we
feel
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
i'd
like
to
sit
down
right
now
if
i'm
not
sure
with
the
answer.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
i
--
no.
i
--
we
don't'
want
to
mislead
the
court
as
to
what's
the
factual
situation
is.
we
don't
want
you
to
think
we're
trying
to
lay
taxes
on
land
which
is
in
iowa
or
anything
like
that.
we
feel
that
that
creates
a
status
because
in
entering
into
the
compact,
we
--
the
only
thing
we
could
do;
we
did
it
pursuant
to
constitutional
requirements.
we
can't,
not
that
we
engage
in
war
anyway,
we
can't.
we've
given
up
that
right
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
the
agitation
was
so
great
your
honor
and
the
uncertainty
all
up
and
down
the
entire
boundary
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
no,
oh,
no.
there
are
nebraska
citizens.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
who
owned
land
in
iowa
because
of
the
compact.
now,
as
one
fellow
says,
i
was
in
nebraska
and
i
went
to
war
and
i
came
back
and
all
my
lands
are
in
iowa.
i
don't
know
how
it
happened.
and
these
people
in
the
cases
we've
considered
there
are
some
nebraskans
and
certainly
there
are
some
iowans
too
but
there
are
many
nebraskans
who
have
land
on
that
side
of
the
river
now.
they
go
across
the
river
and
they
farm
it.
we
have
--
we
think
stated
in
the
complaint
the
facts
concerning
a
lot
of
this
land
and
some
of
this
land
had
been
on
the
tax
rule
since
1895.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
no.
no,
but
you
see
your
honor,
for
an
individual
landowner
they
have
to
go
up
against
the
state
and
determine
this
matter.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
it
breaks
him.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
he
cannot
afford
to.
these
people
have
all
of
their
money
tied
up
in
their
land.
they're
not
big
corporations.
they've
got
everything
there.
they
have
to
put
in
the
fertilizer
and
the
machinery
and
that
sort
of
thing.
and
here,
iowa
is
saying,
“look
little
guy,
you
got
to
make
a
determination.
the
state
itself
was
unwilling
to
do
43
or
20
years
ago".
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
yes.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
that's
correct
your
honor
and
we
have
asked
for
a
special
master
in
these
two
cases
should
the
court
take
jurisdiction.
we
think
it
can
be
done.
and
we
think
--
we
spent
very
frankly
a
year
and
a
half
approximately
studying
these
two
situations.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
well,
i
know
that
more
than
--
not
by
a
private
litigant
but
at
least
by
the
state
of
nebraska,
more
than
$25,000
have
been
spent
already.
and
we
just
got
into
this
stage
and
that
was
an
investigation.
i
know
in
one
situation
where
a
lawyer
required
half
of
the
private
litigant's
farm
which
was
of
the
substantial
area
to
try
this
kind
of
case
and
it
took
him
five
or
six
years.
and
he
was
--
it
was
an
absurd
matter
but
he
was
entitled
to
it
for
our
services
but
it
meant
that
the
farmer
who
got
a
decree
that
he
own
this
farm
anyway
lost
and
ended
up
with
half
of
his
farm.
and
we
think
this
is
grossly
unjust.
we
don't
think
the
landowner
can
win
in
this
situation.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
i
think
there
is
a
real
question
your
honor
as
to
the
expenditure
of
funds
for
that
purpose.i
don't
know
your
answer
but
i've
heard
people
suggest
that.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
that
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
that
would
of
course
incidentally
in
--
would
incidentally
affect
the
rights
of
these
people
and
would
benefit
them.
it
--
it's
incidental
because
really
these
funds
--
the
funds
are
expanded
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
the
compact.
the
fact
that
they
would
be
benefited
of
course
is
nice
because
it
relieves
them
of
a
real
burden.
but
our
legislature
and
we
attached
a
copy
as
an
exhibit
of
the
legislative
resolution
at
page
99
of
our
complaint
indicated
that
the
state
was
deeply
concerned
on
behalf
of
its
citizens
in
this
matter.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
no
your
honor.
we
understand
that.
but
this
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
there
maybe
incidental
issues
between
the
states
but
certainly
this
court
could
determine
where
the
boundary
was
in
1943
at
the
time
of
the
compact.
if
we
didn't
have
a
boundary
compact,
the
court
would
--
could
find
out
where
the
boundary
is
there
now.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
well,
the
finding
of
the
boundary
and
line
i
think
would
your
honor.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
because
i
think
it's
only
between
in
this
court
and
an
action
between
two
states
or
by
compact
where
you
can
determine
a
boundary
line
as
between
two
states.
certainly,
the
court
always
tries
titles
where
individuals
have
to
--
themselves
show
where
the
property
is.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
your
honor,
only
because
we
placed
that
land
in
iowa
by
the
compact.
you
see,
we
place
that
they're
subject
to
conditions.
we
didn't
just
say
this
is
a
new
line.
we
insisted
that
this
is
only
the
line
if
you
respect
the
titles,
liens,
and
mortgages
which
would
be
in
nebraska.
and
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
i
think
there
is
a
good
possibility
that's
so.
it
seems
to
me
that
i've
seen
in
all
the
reading
that
there
is
a
question
in
some
circum
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
well,
we
want
to
--
of
course
to
recognize
these
principles
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
well,
your
honor,
we
have
but
you
see,
it
isn't
we
think
when
a
state
enters
into
a
compact.
it
isn't
just
saying
our
courts
will
agree
to
this.
we
think
that
compact
is
a
document
which
is
binding
on
the
entire
state
and
all
its
citizens.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
but
the
state
itself
is
questioning
those
since
we
think
that
a
breach
occurs
in
this
situation
in
the
questioning
of
these
titles
by
the
state
because
the
result
is
no
matter
what
the
outcome,
the
individual
landowners
have
been
deprived
of
his
land.
this
is
a
good
reason
why
the
states
might
insist
on
this
kind
of
provision
in
the
first
place
because
when
they
talk
about
selling
boundaries,
what
comes
up
is,
how
do
we
protect
joe
dukes
(ph)
who
has
got
land
down
here
on
the
river.
well,
we'll
put
it
in
a
clause
of
--
to
protect
it.
and
since
iowa
solemnly
agreed
to
this,
we
would
assume
that
all
of
the
iowa
branches
would
live
up
to
this
commitment
including
their
attorney
general's
office
and
their
conservation
commission
because
we
think
they're
bound
by
this.
they
didn't
say,
“our
courts
will
respect
your
titles.”
iowa
said,
“we,
iowa
will
respect
your
titles
in
effect.”
and
iowa
itself
is
here
as
a
party.
we
at
least
your
honor,
we
think
we're
entitled
to
a
determination
whether
that
conduct
is
a
breach
of
the
compact.
we
want
to
know
what
we've
agreed
to.
we
have
got
boundary
questions
right
now
with
missouri.
we've
got
other
boundary
questions
with
iowa.
there
has
been
a
talk
about
the
compact.
we
wonder
how
we
can
enter
into
a
compact
if
we're
merely
creating
a
situation
whereby
some
individual
is
going
to
have
his
title
attacked.
and
so
we
think
that
the
purpose
of
the
compact
requirement
in
the
constitution
would
be
defeated
if
a
state
can't
enforce
a
compact
which
is
entered
into.
this
is
really
the
crux
of
our
argument.
these
rights
arise
out
of
contract.
they're
not
independent
situations
which
existed.
and
of
course
the
alternative
is
that
what
we
decide
we
couldn't
intervene
in
the
iowa
suits.
we're
faced
with
that
situation
and
cases
were
pending.
we
didn't
think
it's
proper
to
subject
to
the
state
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
iowa
courts
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
compact.
this
court
has
often
held
that
compact
shouldn't
be
subject
to
the
unilateral
construction
by
one
court.
and
iowa
was
construing
it
their
way.
we
don't
have
anything
to
say
about
it.
we
don't
have
any
--
the
iowa
attorney
general's
office
has
taken
the
position
and
the
state
of
iowa
consequently
in
these
cases
that
the
law
of
nebraska
is
irrelevant
immaterial.
it
doesn't
have
any
bearing
at
all.
and
we
don't
see
how
you
can
have
any
decision
as
to
the
river
itself
without
having
--
without
taking
into
account
what
the
compact
does,
because
iowa's
argument
leads
to
one
other
sort
of
absurd
result.
well
first,
there's
one
another
unfairness
i'd
like
to
mention.
and
that
is
that
iowa
has
waited
20
years
before
they've
done
anything
about
the
situation.
and
we
think
of
course
that
it
--
that
this
constitutes
a
course
of
conduct
which
is
consistent
with
nebraska's
contentions.
witnesses
have
died
during
this
period.
lands
have
been
cleared.
landmarks
have
been
destroyed.
trees
have
been
removed
which
might
indicate
when
this
land
was
formed.
and
this
court
in
previous
cases
considering
boundary
has
recognized
that
the
operation
of
time
can
operate
to
a
tremendous
prejudice
to
the
individuals.
and
here
again,
the
only
person
who
is
prejudice
is
the
landowner
because
the
state
is
sitting
there
saying,
“we
are
a
sovereign”.
they're
saying
that
you
can't
apply
adverse
possession
against
us.
we're
not
subject
to
the
normal
doctrines
of
latches
or
estoppel.
and
therefore,
the
state
can
wait
20
years
until
everybody
dies
and
bring
their
suit.
we
think
that
situation
isn't
just.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
certainly
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
i
know
there
was
one
case
which
we
cited,
the
massachusetts
against
--
or
rhode
island
against
massachusetts
where
the
court
said
that
we
find
one
issue
which
we
should
hear,
we
would
take
jurisdiction.
but
i'm
not
sure
your
honor
that
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
i
don't
think
that
that
50
feet
is
crucial
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
no.
that's
put
in,
in
part
to
show
that
iowa
--
it's
another
indication
of
iowa's
unilateral
construction
of
this
compact
and
their
complete
disregard
for
what
we
contend
the
compact
says.
it's
another
example
of
conduct
by
them
which
in
effect
says,
“we
don't
care
what
nebraska
thinks.
we're
going
to
go
on
our
own
way,
under
our
own
law,
and
with
our
own
principles.”
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
yes
sir
your
honor
because
of
the
compact
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
well,
your
honor,
we
think
it
goes
beyond
that
because
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
i
think
the
principle
behind
the
court's
taking
jurisdiction
because
of
the
--
or
allegation
of
breach
of
compact
and
iowa's
denial
of
that
allegation
is
sufficient.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
even
though
it
turns
on
these
factual
matters
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
the
(inaudible)
--
well
of
course,
we
have
claimed
there
are.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
yes
sir.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
i
think
so
your
honor
because
we
have
no
place
else
to
go
to
obtain
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
no
and
iowa's
mere
statement
that
they're
not
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
that's
right.
they're
saying
we're
not,
therefore,
we
can
go
and
do
what
we
please
but
by
saying
they're
not
they
have
created
the
controversy
because
they're
denying
it.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
in
light
of
the
history
behind
it
and
the
meaning
and
in
front
of
the
compact
at
the
time,
we
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
your
honor
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
no.
they
certainly
have
their
own
private
rights
which
they
can
claim
in
any
suit.
we
don't
know
that
they're
discriminating
or
not
discriminating
against
nebraska
citizens.
all
we
know
is
that
somehow,
they
made
a
decision
as
to
which
land
they
were
going
to
go
after.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
well,
our
contention
is
that
it
was
--
that
the
facts
would
show
and
that
the
purpose
of
the
compact
was
to
settle
controversy
and
settle
the
boundary
along
the
missouri
as
between
the
states
and
the
individuals.
and
that
in
light
of
that
purpose
and
in
light
of
that
history,
it
should
be
settled
as
to
these
individual
titles
which
were
on
the
tax
roles
in
the
state
of
nebraska,
its
title
compact
which
were
occupied
by
individual
citizens
of
the
state
of
nebraska
in
which
--
and
which
nebraska
had
exercised
jurisdiction
over
the
land.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
your
honor,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
question
about
avulsion
here
because
the
corps
of
engineers
when
it
--
not
only
natural
avulsion
but
the
conduct
of
the
corps
of
engineers
want
to
stabilize
the
channel
because
the
corps
designed
the
channel
and
then
it
moved
this
river
in
various
ways.
there
were
many
areas
where
there
were
islands,
channels
on
both
sides,
the
corps
cut
off
one
side
and
shove
the
river
clear
over.
in
one
of
these
factual
situations,
we
have
evidence
that
the
corps
of
engineers
dug
a
ditch
completely
in
nebraska
for
about
6000
feet.
now
in
1892,
the
decision
of
this
court
was
the
normal
rules
of
avulsion
and
accretion
apply.
but
we
wonder
whether
these
presumptions
that
follow
and
some
of
these
rules
are
still
applicable
in
light
of
the
fact
the
corps
completely
redesigned
the
channel
and
moved
it
around
like
it
did.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
that
is
not
the
basis
for
it,
it
maybe
a
fact.
we
don't
say
it
is
or
isn't
because
we
don't
know
how
they
make
their
determination.
and
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
no.
no,
we
don't
mean
that
it
gives
them
any
greater
rights
and
it
--
or
that
gives
the
nebraska
land
any
greater
rights
necessarily
unless
this
language
is
construed
that
it
means
that
iowa
by
entering
into
this
compact
thereby
adopted
the
nebraska
theory
as
to
the
missouri
river
concerning
states
easements
in
the
bed
--
in
the
river
itself
as
opposed
to
state
ownership
of
the
bed.
iowa,
we
think
may
well
have
--
when
you
look
--
and
this
compact
could
be
construed
to
indicate
that
iowa
thereby
gave
up
its
claim
of
title
in
the
bed
as
against
these
people.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
we
think
that
the
compact
--
no,
it
doesn't
in
so
many
words
your
honor
but
we
don't
think
you
can
read
the
compact
by
just
looking
at
the
language.
we
think
that
the
conduct
and
the
reasoning
that
what
really
promulgated
the
compact,
the
circumstance
had
formed
the
conduct
after
are
important
in
finding
out
what
this
compact
means.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
no
your
honor,
but
it
is
our
theory
that
they
agreed
they
would
respect
and
maintain
that
title.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
well
your
honor,
it
depends.
i
don't
think
it
necessarily
would
because
when
a
state
enters
into
a
compact,
it
is
more
than
just
entering
--
passing
for
instance
reciprocal
legislation.
it
isn't
just
passing
legislation
saying
this
is
the
fact.
it's
saying
we
agree.
and
one
of
the
questions
put
in
issue
is
what
does
this
mean
when
the
state
says
we
agree.
because
some
of
the
language
seems
to
indicate
that
what
a
state
agrees,
this
is
binding
on
all
the
state
officials.
in
the
boundary
situations,
we
think
that
--
and
this
somewhat
goes
into
something
that
would
go
to
merits
but
we
think
there's
a
very
appropriate
quote
from
indiana
versus
kentucky
which
is
a
no
boundary
case
in
which
they
said,
one
of
the
great
questions
which
concerns
the
boundaries
of
states
where
great
natural
boundaries
are
established
in
general
terms
with
the
view
to
public
convenience
and
avoidance
of
controversy.
we
think
the
great
object
when
it
can
be
distinctively
perceived
ought
not
to
be
defeated
by
those
technical
perplexities
which
sometimes
influence
contracts
between
individuals.
those
principles
and
considerations
which
produce
the
boundary
ought
to
preserve
it.
we
think
that
these
are
important
things
and
we
think
that
the
compact
should
be
looked
at
or
we
might
have
reached
a
rule
of
construction
of
a
compact
and
that
these
things
should
be
construed
to
eliminate
controversy,
not
create
controversy.
and
we
contend
what
iowa's
doing
is
creating
controversy.
it
also
in
the
--
it
creates
a
completely
impossible
situation
as
to
what
is
the
law
in
the
present
missouri
river
because
when
this
river
moves,
does
iowa
then
require
a
new
title
to
a
new
bed,
there
are
areas
where
the
river
was
completely
in
nebraska
at
the
time
of
the
compact.
iowa
says,
these
titles
are
good
in
nebraska
and
will
be
good
in
iowa.
they
make
a
new
boundary.
i
would
suppose
that
that
would
mean
that
iowa
would
have
to
recognize
that
the
nebraska
riparian
owner
own
the
entire
bed.
but
nowhere
has
iowa
ever
admitted
that
in
any
of
the
cases.
there
might
be
other
cases
where
iowa
would
own
the
entire
bed.
there
might
be
other
cases
where
there
might
be
an
easement
to
half
the
river
and
there
might
be
iowa
ownership
of
the
bed
in
the
other
half.
and
these
islands
are
forming
and
disappearing.
we're
not
asking
for
a
determination
of
disputes
between
these
individuals.
we
think
the
state
of
iowa
itself
took
itself
out
of
the
picture
when
it
entered
into
the
compact.
we
would
therefore
submit
that
we
think
we
do
have
a
controversy
between
the
states.
we
think
it
depends
on
this
compact.
we
think
that
the
public
interest
is
to
be
served
by
this
courts
taking
jurisdiction
and
making
a
determination
on
the
merits,
because
we
think
that
it
could
be
an
extreme
deterrent
to
any
state,
to
everyone
entering
to
another
compact.
if
by
doing
so,
it
could
place
its
citizens
in
a
position
which
it
might
not
want
to
do.
we
think
that
it
was
a
matter
of
great
public
interest
or
it
would
not
have
been
included
in
the
first
place
and
that
justice
and
fairness
and
right
will
be
served.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
your
honor,
the
only
other
way
that
i
can
see,
of
course
these
people
can
have
their
action
determined
in
the
state
courts.
and
if
they've
got
the
resources,
if
they've
got
the
money,
they
might
be
able
to
get
it
up
here
on
appeal.
then
i
suppose
certiorari
might
be
discretional
with
this
court.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
you
see,
this
is
another
thing
your
honor.
the
--
in
a
private
litigation
like
this,
when
the
landowner
raises
the
compact,
these
questions
are
very
difficult
to
determine.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
well,
i
have
read
a
law
review
note
which
says
it
does
not.
i've
seen
some
indications,
in
some
of
the
cases
it
does.
so
i
can't
say
it's
clear.
but
you
see
the
state
court
can
easily
avoid
this
problem
because
the
state
court
can
find
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
land
was
clear
over
some
place
else
and
was
not
involved
along
the
river.
and
i
wouldn't
suggest
that
any
intension
on
fairness
but
we
think
you
should
avoid
not
only
unfairness
but
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
oh
i
--
yes,
i
don't
think
it
would
unless
we
get
the
two
states
before
us
and
then
we
can
determine.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
is
there
anyway
to
enforce
the
compact,
right.
and
particularly
if
you
make
an
agreement
which
you
may
not
be
able
to
show
an
interest
in
the
subject
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
there's
no
place
to
go
and
we
just
want
a
fair
decision
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
that's
correct
your
honor.
i
have
nothing
to
say
so,
thank
you.
mr.
howard
h.
moldenhauer
we
only
have
a
few
short
comments
your
honor.
we
think
we
have
specially
alleged
the
breach.
we
would
like
to
--
we
wonder
really
in
light
of
our
--
iowa's
argument,
what
the
purpose
of
the
compact
was?
what
the
compact
was
intended
to
accomplish?
particularly
when
we
considered
that
at
the
time
of
the
compact,
we
have
land
on
which
taxes
had
been
paid
in
nebraska
since
1895.
we
had
land
--
the
same
land
which
had
been
surveyed
and
was
in
1933,
10
years
prior
to
the
compact
was
on
record
in
the
nebraska
county.
they
have
the
quiet
title
action
to
it
in
1940
in
nebraska
with
all
of
the
individuals
before
the
court
at
least.
there
had
been
land
sold
through
in
the
state
proceedings
in
the
district
court.
individuals
lived
on
the
island.
they
voted
nebraska.
there
were
these
census
reports
in
nebraska.
children
were
born
and
died
on
the
island.
we
found
that
(inaudible)
verse
recorded
with
the
nebraska
bureau
of
vital
statistics.
the
inhabitants
at
all
times
considered
themselves
inhabitants
of
the
state
of
iowa
and
iowa
when
this
is
raised
says
that
these
titles
are
spurious.
well,
we
wonder
what
situations
like
that
would
--
the
purpose
of
the
compact
was.
we
think
that
we're
entitled
as
between
ourselves
to
a
determination.
if
nebraska
ended
up
giving
away
a
lot
of
things
without
extracting
any
promises,
if
we
really
got
take
in
there
for
suckers,
we
want
to
know
we're
suckers.
we
think
we're
entitled
to
know
that.
this
court
even
in
its
dissent
has
recognized
in
arkansas
against
texas
which
was
cited
by
the
defendant
that
if
a
controversy
between
two
states
concerns
a
construction
a
compact,
this
court
must
of
course
determine
their
rights
and
necessity
and
we
think
we're
entitled
to
a
determination
of
these
rights
as
between
ourselves.
we
entered
into
the
compact.
we
entered
into
the
commitment
not
our
citizen
but
we
did
and
we
think
we're
entitled
to
know
now
what
this
means
in
light
of
the
situation
which
developed.
thank
you.
