justice
byron
r.
white
well,
even
if
there
was
no
doubt
at
all
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
compact,
i
would
assume
you
would
say
you
had
a
right
to
come
in
to
this
court
just
for
enforcement.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
is
your
interest
in
this
--
assuming
there's
no
doubt
at
all
about
the
meaning
of
the
compact,
just
assume
that.
now
all
your
allegation
is
iowa
is
breaching
its
promise
which
it
made
to
the
state
of
nebraska.
what
is
nebraska's
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
no
more
interest
in
the
land
that's
located
in
iowa?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
can't
--
you're
going
--
may
settle
your
argument
with
iowa
to
sue
to
sustain
here
and
you
win
but
the
results
here
aren't
going
to
bind
these
private
litigants.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they
could
just
--
if
they
--
if
some
of
them
didn't
like
the
answer
they
got
here,
i
suppose
they
could
start
all
over
again.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
moldenhauer,
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
there's
--
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
in
this
case
where
the
boundary
line
is.
in
short,
assume
that
--
well,
there
is
one
piece
of
this
ground
i
take
it
that
you
admit
is
in
iowa.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
admit
that
it's
in
iowa
and
all
that
you
say
is
that
iowa
is
living
up
to
its
obligations
under
the
compact
with
regard
to
that
piece
of
ground.
now,
iowa
says
that
it
is.
iowa
says
the
only
dispute
is
whether
this
person
who's
private
owner
really
is
--
owns
that
land
or
--
and
has
the
right
which
were
protected
under
the
compact.
and
this
may
well
turn
on
for
example
on
whether
or
not
this
island
or
these
lands
involved
(inaudible)
before
or
after
the
compact.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
if
it
accreted
before,
it
was
--
it's
probably
older
than
the
nebraska
law
and
repeated
after
the
state
owned
it
under
iowa
law.
now,
assume
that's
the
only
issue
there
is
in
the
whole
case,
just
as
to
whether
or
not
this
private
landowner
did
have
some
rights
or
does
have
some
rights
which
the
compact
protected.
and
that
depends
on
wholly
factual
matters
of
determining
when
and
under
what
circumstances
(inaudible)
in
the
river
came
in
to
being.
now
would
you
say
that
that
is
a
matter
for
an
original
case
in
this
court?
it
is
that
you
are
alleging
a
breach
of
compact.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say,
"iowa,
you're
breaching
that
con
--
that
compact
because
this
piece
of
land
belongs
to
a
resident
of
nebraska
whose
rights
are
protected
by
the
compact".
and
so
you
would
be
alleging
a
breach
of
compact
by
iowa.
but
is
it
that
the
kind
of
a
case
that
you
think
ought
to
be
up
here
on
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
just
answer
that
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
it
turns
wholly
on
the
factual
matter
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no
matter
what
destruction
involved?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
iowa
is
certainly
isn't
--
doesn't
admit
that
they're
breaching
the
compact.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
part
of
their
answer
to
you
is
just
what
i've
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
--
many
other
way
for
you
to
enforce
that
compact?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
we
say
that
you
can't
have
it
enforced
here,
that
will
have
a
chilling
effect
on
your
--
entering
any
more
compact.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
you're
going
to
explain
why
nebraska
doesn't
have
an
interest
in
enforcing
iowa's
promise
into
this
compact.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
got
contracting
parties
and
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
that's
true,
then
here,
we've
got
iowa
--
nebraska
saying,
“you
broke
your
promise
about
two
pieces
of
the
land".
and
you
say,
well
that
claim
is
all
--
it
sounds
like
one
that
nebraska
has
got
an
interest
in.
but
you
come
back
and
say,
“we
deny
we're
breaching
the
compact.
that
those
two
pieces
of
land,
neither
one
of
them
was
in
existence
or
owned
and
owned
by
a
nebraska
citizen
in
the
state
of
nebraska
at
the
time
the
compact
was
signed".
if
that
--
now
does
that
change
the
jurisdictional
question
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there
were?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
mere
fact
that
--
the
mere
--
if
there
were
sufficient
facts
alleged,
the
mere
fact
that
iowa
--
that
nebraska
doesn't
have
an
interest
in
the
land
isn't
going
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
you're
really
saying
that
we
ought
to
be
ruling
here
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
not
based
on
jurisdiction.
but
if
--
that
the
--
if
they
pleaded
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
understand
that
but
you're
--
but
the
--
but
--
do
you
say
if
there
were
--
that
there
isn't
any
jurisdiction
because
he
has
completed
the
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
--
where
do
you
--
on
what
do
you
base
your
claim
that
there
is
--
that
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
in
this
case?
because
in
--
unquestionably,
iowa
is
saying
you
breached
your
contract.
i
mean
if
that's
its
allegation
you
say
that
(inaudible)
enough
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
because
of
the
insufficiency
of
the
factual
allegation.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
get
it
--
the
state
now.
let's
suppose
the
complaint
by
nebraska
says,
near
the
track
of
land
a
and
they
described
it,
which
the
time
the
compact
was
entered
into
was
located
in
the
state
of
nebraska
and
was
owned
by
mr.
x.
iowa
promised
to
respect
that
title
in
the
compact
if
we
convey
--
if
we
gave
up
our
claim
to
it.
we
put
in
effect
quick
claim
any
interest
that
nebraska
had
to
the
state
of
iowa
in
exchange
for
that
promise.
iowa
is
now
asserting
that
it
owns
track
a
and
has
sued
mr.
x
in
the
iowa
courts
to
establish
title
of
the
state
of
iowa.
we
allege
that
iowa
is
breaching
its
promise
that
it
gave
in
the
compact.
and
we
ask
that
the
united
states
supreme
court
take
jurisdiction
and
adjudicate
our
claim.
iowa
of
course
says
track
a
wasn't
in
the
state
of
iowa
or
in
the
state
of
nebraska
at
the
time
the
compact
was
formed.
that
track
came
into
existence
by
accretion
after
the
compact
was
formed.
i'll
use
--
just
on
those
bare
facts,
was
there
a
suit
between
two
states
if
we
ought
to
pick
jurisdiction
out
here
in
this
court?
or
do
we
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
--
now,
how
about
the
other
question.
how
about
the
question
--
are
you
saying
we
have
no
jurisdiction
because
they're
indispensable
parties
that
ought
to
be
here
and
aren't?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
just
a
question
on
whether
we
ought
to
exercise
that
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
that
jurisdiction,
we
could
take
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
indispensable
parties
came
in
here
and
said
that
we
have
--
we
want
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
we
don't
abide
by
anything
that
happens.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
that
your
only
response
though
to
--
is
that
your
only
reason
for
saying
that
it
--
on
that
hypothetical
case
i
gave
you
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
for
just
a
moment,
let's
assume
that
in
this
case
--
in
this
situation
that
babbitt
and
whatever
the
other
name
is,
had
actually
litigated
and
finished
their
litigation
with
iowa
in
the
state
courts
of
iowa
and
iowa
had
won.
and
the
courts
have
adjudicated
that
this
land
has
--
is
owned
by
the
state
of
iowa
and
that
schemmel
and
babbitt
had
no
interest
in
the
land.
and
nebraska
meanwhile
has
been
much
of
this
litigation.
he
said,
"we
have
more
than
a
party
to
that
suit.
those
cases
weren't
well
tried.
those
in
private
parties
didn't
have
the
money
to
investigate
or
present
the
facts.
we're
going
to
sue
iowa
in
the
united
states
supreme
court".
and
they
brought
the
suit
here.
why
shouldn't
nebraska
have
the
right
to
determine
whether
or
not
iowa's
promise
in
the
compact
has
been
breached?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
but
this
hypothetical
that
i
just
gave
you,
the
hypothetical
i
just
gave
you.
no
matter
what
the
iowa's
supreme
--
iowa's
state
courts
determine
in
the
litigation
between
the
private
parties
in
the
state
of
iowa.
no
matter
what
those
courts
determine,
wouldn't
nebraska
have
the
right
to
come
here
and
--
in
an
original
suit,
and
have
its
claim
against
iowa
litigated?
