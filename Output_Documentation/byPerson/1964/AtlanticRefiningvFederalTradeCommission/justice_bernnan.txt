[inaudible]
of
pages
b68
and
69
--
section
7,
8
and
9?
mr.
justice
bernnan
well
i'm
looking
at
the
commission's
order.
mr.
justice
bernnan
--
and
six.
mr.
justice
bernnan
well
then,
do
i
understand
the
issue
that
the
atlantic
raises
that
it
is
limited
then
the
one,
two,
three,
and
four?
mr.
justice
bernnan
well
let's
see
what
is
happening
mr.
ballard
is
that
your
dealers
now,
you
are
going
to
say
make
this
kind
of
contract
and
nevertheless
free
to
go
out,
as
is
said
here
in
six,
displaying
tba
products
of
his
own
independent
choice?
mr.
justice
bernnan
i
don't
want
any
[inaudible]
without
the
--
i
understood
you
to
say
that
in
fact
things
like
other
than
the
atlantic
refining
company
would
mean
what,
that
atlantic
could
buy
all
these
from
goodyear
--
mr.
justice
bernnan
--directly
and
then
market
it
to
its
dealer?
mr.
justice
bernnan
but
what
it
may
not
do
is
what?
mr.
justice
bernnan
by
atlantic?
mr.
justice
bernnan
for
which
you
get
a
--
atlantic
get
suppose
some
kind
of
overwriting?
mr.
justice
bernnan
yes.
mr.
justice
bernnan
well
your
precedents.
mr.
justice
bernnan
well
that's
what
you
pay
that
expense.
mr.
justice
bernnan
[inaudible]
all
of
you
retailers
are
now
using
those
goodyear
distribution
points
and
continue
to
buy
to
them
rather
than
from
your
new
[inaudible]
--
mr.
justice
bernnan
what
i
gather,
if
you
understand
this
order
to
require,
to
return
to
the
purchase
resale
and
to
establish
your
own
distribution
system
with
your
own
distribution
centers,
is
that
it?
mr.
justice
bernnan
can
you
use
one
of
the
present
goodyear
distribution
point
though?
mr.
justice
bernnan
those
that
they
operate
themselves.
mr.
justice
bernnan
well
in
any
event,
that
you
say
it
--
at
the
outset
mr.
ballard
that
this
atlantic
can't
afford
not
to
do
sponsoring
--
mr.
justice
bernnan
operation
with
all
these
entail,
they
got
a
training,
and
--
mr.
justice
bernnan
keeping
them
supply
(voice
overlap)
well
that's
--
mr.
justice
bernnan
well
it's
not
a
fact
i
would
suppose
that
exceptions
1,
3,
and
4
(voice
overlap)
mr.
justice
bernnan
is
this
the
same
thing
at
370
in
your
appendix?
mr.
justice
bernnan
are
you
going
to
distinguish
non
coercive
use
in
the
ordinary
[inaudible]
mr.
justice
bernnan
you
are
talking
about
non-coercive.
mr.
justice
bernnan
is
that
coercion?
mr.
justice
bernnan
pressure
is
not
coercion.
mr.
justice
bernnan
do
you
have
power
in
use
meaning
pressure
not
power
in
use
meaning
pressure.
mr.
justice
bernnan
may
i
get
back
to
[inaudible]
mr.
justice
bernnan
are
you
suggesting
that
the
first
sentence
that
we
find
in
the
appellants
has
a
--
mr.
justice
bernnan
then
we
further
find,
are
you
suggesting
me
through
alternative
basis,
alternative
findings?
mr.
justice
bernnan
well
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
it.
in
other
words,
the
conclusion
for
reasons
set
forth
here
in
our
brief,
it
means
for
either
of
those
things.
is
that
it?
we
conclude
that
the
exide
has
found
[inaudible]
mr.
justice
bernnan
and
that
if
they
have
the
power,
all
they
have
to
do
with
the
power
is
to
sign
the
commission
plan.
mr.
justice
bernnan
well
aren't
you
just
-
exactly,
this
was
to
say
the
sales
contract
-
it
says
that
sales
commission
system
--
mr.
justice
bernnan
--
itself.
and
are
you
saying
anything
different
then
that
the
overt
acts
of
coercion
prove
are
merely
things
to
establish
that
this
is
the
way
this
kind
of
sales
commission
system
inherently
have
found
to
operate
the
way
it's
structured.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
mr.
justice
bernnan
that's
not
a
hypothetical
issue?[laughter]
mr.
justice
bernnan
how
can
he
give?
mr.
justice
bernnan
i
suppose
mr.
friedman
you
answered
to
mr.
sonnett's
suggestions
about
the
government's
attorney
talking
about
the
contract,
there's
enough
of
this,
that
the
system
you
--
mr.
justice
bernnan
-
and
not
just
a
contract
standing
alone.
mr.
justice
bernnan
[inaudible]
mr.
justice
bernnan
i'm
still
puzzled
that
goodyear
laying
aside
now
what
all
that
the
samples
of
the
three
other
oil
companies,
how
--
i've
forgotten
some
said
were
150
--
you
said
they're
eight
--
eight
or
nine
or
whatever
it
is,
how
the
board
can
conclude
it
necessarily,
whatever
the
arrangement
maybe
other
oil
dealers
do
anymore
than
what
you
said
that
eliminated
at
least
the
thought
maybe
permissible.
the
stocks
available
go
by.
mr.
justice
bernnan
you
mean
that
the
actual
operation
--
mr.
justice
bernnan
--
were
similar
to
those
that
were
proved
in
greater
detail
than
the
operation
in
the
atlantic
company.
mr.
justice
bernnan
well
as
to
the
problem,
i
don't
know
how
that
apprise
to
eight
or
nine.
mr.
justice
bernnan
which
--
oh
and
--
three
of
which
operated
the
same
as
the
atlantic
company.
mr.
justice
bernnan
i
forgot
[inaudible]
mr.
justice
bernnan
[inaudible]
order
or
something
like
this,
something
like
the
broch
order?
mr.
justice
bernnan
[inaudible]
a
sales
commission
plan
or
a
system
were
modified
as
between
atlantic
and
goodyear
[inaudible]
well
let's
put
it
in
the
context,
we
submit
that
it'd
be
alright
on
purchase
and
resale
namely
that
atlantic
could
be
willing
to
pay
commission
for
doing
it
really
encourage
their
dealers
to
buy
from
goodyear
and
from
goodyear
to
sales
points
but
made
it
clear
that
they
were
free
and
they
didn't
care
if
they
didn't
go
shop
around
anywhere
else,
would
that
kind
of
thing
be
a
sort
of
thing
to
the
parties
to
get
a
modification
in
this
order?
mr.
justice
bernnan
well
i
difficulty
when
i
asked
the
question
is
i
thought
you
told
me
earlier,
there's
no
contention
of
the
government
that
the
sales
commission
contract
in
and
of
itself
runs
afoul
of
such
requirement.
it's
only
the
performance
under
the
contract.
mr.
justice
bernnan
the
method
of
operation
--
mr.
justice
bernnan
i
would
suppose
that
would
mean,
there
would
be
a
number
of
the
method
employed
in
the
performance
of
the
contract
if
eliminated
that
would
satisfy.
mr.
justice
bernnan
but
you
do
not
--
the
government
does
not
suggest
that
there
may
not
be
commission
sales
arrangements
which
wouldn't
-
which
would
satisfy

5.
