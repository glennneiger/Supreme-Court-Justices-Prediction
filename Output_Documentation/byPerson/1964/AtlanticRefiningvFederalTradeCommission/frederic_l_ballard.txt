mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
proceeding
under
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
the
principle
issue
for
the
court
at
this
stage
in
the
proceeding
is
the
legality
of
a
contract
between
the
atlantic
refining
company,
an
oil
company,
and
the
goodyear
tire
&
rubber
company,
which
is
a
maker
of
tires,
tubes,
and
other
rubber
products.
under
this
contract,
atlantic
promotes
the
sale
of
goodyear
tires
and
batteries,
and
accessories,
automotive
accessories,
which
are
called
tba.
they
referred
to
in
the
proceedings
and
in
the
industry
as
tba
standing
for
tires,
batteries,
and
accessories.
atlantic
promotes
the
sale
of
these
articles
through
the
service
stations
which
handle
atlantic
gasoline
and
this
is
atlantic's
part
of
the
bargain.
goodyear's
part
of
the
bargain
is
to
pay
atlantic
a
commission
for
these
services.
the
trade
commission
issued
a
complaint
charging
that
this
sales
and
commission
contract
is
an
unfair
method
of
competition
within
the
meaning
of
section
5
of
the
act.
the
examiner
for
the
federal
trade
commission
after
extensive
hearings,
upheld
the
legality
of
the
contract,
but
he
found
that
atlantic
had
coerced
its
dealers
to
buy
tba,
and
he
entered
an
order
to
prohibit
that
coercion.
this
order
in
substance
was
affirmed
by
the
commission
and
it
was
also
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
seventh
circuit.
now
atlantic
has
not
sought
a
further
review
of
this
portion
of
the
order
and
this
is
the
first
point
your
honors
that
i
would
like
to
stress
because
it's
a
very
important
point.
as
this
case
was
presented
to
the
trade
commission,
and
as
it
was
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
the
issue
of
coercion
was
not
only
in
the
case,
but
it
dominated
the
case.
this
was
as
the
trade
commission
saw
it,
and
that
the
seventh
circuit
saw
it,
a
coercion
case.
now
if
your
honors
please,
we
took
vigorous
exception
to
this.
we
felt
that
the
evidence
did
not
support
these
findings,
but
having
lost
that
issue
before
the
commission
and
having
lost
it
again
before
the
seventh
circuit,
we
do
not
press
it
here
and
we
accept
the
sections
of
the
commission's
order
which
are
designed
broadly,
sweepingly
to
prohibit
and
eliminate
coercion
and
to
guarantee
to
our
dealers
their
freedom
of
choice.
now
your
honors,
we
believe
that
that
should
have
been
the
answer
to
this
case.
we
believe
that
once
you
are
given
--
once
the
fact
of
coercion
is
approved
or
accepted,
that
the
hearing
examiner
was
right.
the
correct
disposition
of
the
case
was
an
order
against
coercion.
this
would
have
taken
care
of
the
competitive
evil
which
was
uppermost
in
the
mind
of
the
commission
and
we
know
it
was
uppermost
in
the
mind
of
the
commission
your
honors,
because
the
great
bulk
of
the
testimony
in
this
case
was
from
dealer
witnesses
and
actually
ex-dealer
witnesses
who
complained
that
that
they
had
been
forced
by
various
methods
of
coercion,
some
sophisticated,
some
more
open
to
buy
goodyear
tba.
and
the
remainder
of
the
bulk
of
the
testimony
was
from
independents
so-called
independent
wholesalers
of
tba,
people
who
called
on
these
dealers
from
time
to
time
and
who
complained
that
they
found
it
extremely
difficult
if
not
to
impossible
to
sell
to
the
dealers
and
that
they
felt
that
the
dealers
were
required
to
buy
the
tba
that
atlantic
was
promoting,
that
the
dealers
themselves
felt
this
and
that
therefore
they
were
foreclosed
in
the
station.
now
your
honors,
we
believe
that
this
was
the
heart
of
the
commission's
case,
this
notion
of
foreclosure,
this
notion
of
coercion,
and
it
would
be
completely
cured
by
the
two
paragraphs
of
the
order
which
are
not
before
this
court
because
we
have
accepted
it.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
have
this.
i
don't
--
perhaps,
it's
in
one
of
your
papers.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
i
had
the
appendix
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
the
--
in
the
goodyear
appendix,
the
order
of
the
hearing
examiner,
sir,
is
found
on
a
18
and
19.
and
it
is
a
six-paragraph
order,
all
of
which
is
directed
to
the
issue
of
coercion.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
now
in
the
commission's
order
sir,
the
commission's
order
against
atlantic
is
on
page
68
and
69.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
the
numbers
that
are
out
of
the
case
are
numbers
five
and
six.
five
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
--
which
of
course,
must
be
read
with
the
preamble,
prevents
atlantic
directly
or
indirectly
from
intimidating
or
coercing
or
attempting
to
intimidate
or
coerce
any
wholesaler
or
retailer
of
atlantic
petroleum
products
to
purchase
any
brand
or
brands
of
tba
products.
and
number
six,
the
that's
number
five
says,
you
cannot
force
him
to
buy
it.
number
six
says,
you
cannot
prevent
him
or
attempt
to
prevent
him
from
purchasing
and
reselling,
merchandising,
or
displaying
tba
products
of
his
own
intended
choice.
we
believe
as
the
case
is
presented,
your
honors
may
assume
that
no
atlantic
dealer
will
be
force
to
buy
goodyear
and
no
atlantic
dealer
will
be
prevented
from
buying
whatever
he
chooses
to
buy.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
precisely,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
yes
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
yes
sir,
we
specifically
and
expressly
disavowed
any
effort
to
bring
to
this
court
paragraphs
five
and
six.
now
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
yes
sir,
we
are.
yes
sir.
no
question
about
it.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
precisely,
it's
the
assumption
that
i've
been
going
on,
your
honor.
now
the
commission
as,
your
honors
have
brought
out
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
your
honor,
i
believe
coercion
means
the
use
of
the
power
to
deprive
the
dealer
of
his
freedom
of
choice.
we
had
felt
and
have
stated
in
the
beginning
that
freedom
of
choice
is
the
touch
down.
the
relationship
of
power
so-called,
the
relationship
exists
and
the
commission
recognized
that
it
exists
regardless
of
how
you
distribute
the
tba
to
the
dealer.
we
believe
that
the
touch
down
under
the
decisions
of
this
case
on
tying
and
requirements
contracts
and
so
forth
is
freedom
of
choice.
and
we
believe
that
the
--
that
at
this
point,
we
must
give
the
dealer
the
freedom
of
choice
and
that
it
can
be
done.
we
believe
the
commission
agrees
with
us
so
that
it
can
be
done.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
actually
your
honor,
we
believe
they
were
free
before
the
case.
that's
why
we
-
that's
why
we
carried
it
to
the
seventh
circuit,
but
we've
lost
that
question
in
the
case
and
we
don't
intend
to
argue
it
again
here,
if
your
honor
please.
now
let's
see
what
the
commission
did,
because
the
commission
did
not
do
as
i
have
said
they
should
have
done
and
stopped
at
the
same
point
the
examiner
did.
the
exa
--
the
commission
went
further.
they
said
that
the
method
by
which
the
tba
was
reaching
the
dealers
was
itself
illegal.
in
other
words,
they
say
the
contract
between
atlantic
and
goodyear
was
illegal
and
this
you
will
recall
was
a
sales
commission
contract
and
they
said
they
issued
four
paragraphs
which
read
together
abolished
and
actually
they
recognized,
the
word
abolition
appears
in
their
opinion,
they
recognized
that
they
were
abolishing
the
sales
commission
plan.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
atlantic
agreed
your
honor,
to
promote
the
sale
of
goodyear
tba
through
its
dealers
and
through
the
dealers
to
the
motoring
public.
because
your
honor
will
see
that
there
is
no
point
in
promoting
a
tire
to
a
dealer
unless
you
help
them
to
sell
it
on
to
the
public.
now,
in
order
to
understand
what
the
commission
did
here,
you
have
to
recognize
that
they
did
not
prevent
atlantic
from
having
a
tba
program.
they
put
an
exception.
they
said
that
atlantic
cannot
promote
and
it
cannot
assist
the
dealers
except
where
atlantic
itself
is
the
distributor
or
the
marketer.
now
this
is
a
very
curious
exception
which
can
only
be
understood
against
the
background
of
tba
distribution.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
and
it's
not
in
their
dispute
at
all,
that
tba
is
essential
to
service
station
operation.
your
honors
have
only
to
check
their
personal
knowledge
to
know
this.
when
a
motorist
calls
at
a
service
station,
he
expects
to
find
there
a
new
battery
if
he
needs
it,
a
new
tire
if
he
needs
it,
change
if
it's
a
rainy
day,
a
new
headlight
if
his
light
--
headlight
is
burned
out
at
night.
it
is
essential.
it
is
what
the
motoring
public
expects.
the
motorists
expected.
they
won't
patronize
the
stations
if
they
don't
have
it.
this
means
that
the
dealers
can't
make
money
unless
they
carry
tba.
and
it
is
to
atlantic's
interest
that
every
atlantic
dealer,
not
just
a
great
big
station,
every
atlantic
dealer
shall
have
tba
at
the
station
in
good
supply
or
else
a
ready
source
of
supply
so
that
he
can
meet
legitimate
demands
of
the
motorist.
and
one
dealer's
failure
to
do
that
hurts
the
other
atlantic
dealers
and
it
hurts
atlantic,
because
the
resentment
of
the
motorist
who
can't
get
the
item
that
he
expects
to
find
carries
through
to
the
brand.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
that
is
precisely
what
they
do,
your
honor.
they
say
that
the
--
they
at
least
requires
that
handling
of
tba,
it
does
not
require
the
handling
of
any
particular
kind.
and
all
oil
companies
to
meet
these
legitimate
needs
that
i
described,
all
of
the
oil
companies
with
any
size,
whatsoever,
provide
tba
programs
for
the
dealers.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
the
commission's
order
does
not
concern
itself,
but
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
but
my
point
is
that
that
is
no
longer
in
the
case.
we
have
accepted
that
course
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
if
you
have
read
paragraph
one
of
their
order
and
two,
and
three,
and
four,
you'll
find
in
every
case
an
exception.
in
other
words,
it
says
you
--
number
one
says
you
cannot
have
a
contract
except
where
--
or
relating
to
the
marketing
by
any
marketer
or
distributor
other
than
the
atlantic
refining
company.
you
see
that
does
at
the
bottom
of
number
one.
number
two
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
well
your
honor,
i
believe
you
have
the
--
i
believe
you'll
have
the
examiner's
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
yes
sir,
that's
the
examiner's.
the
commission's
order
is
quite
different.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
now
to
get
back
if
i
may
to
the
argument
today,
we
have
the
fact
that
all
oil
companies
provide
a
tba
program
for
their
dealers.
and
in
fact,
it's
--
this
is
so
universal
that
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
yes,
sir
precisely.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
what
--
well
this
is
a
very
good
question,
your
honor,
but
what
it
may
not
do,
what
it
may
not
do,
is
to
have
its
present
arrangement
under
which
the
tba
instead
of
coming
down
through
a
distribution
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
--
system
--
by
atlantic,
goes
down
through
a
distribution
system
by
goodyear.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
now
you
--
your
honor,
has
just
articulated
the
two
methods
by
which
oil
companies
handle
this
tba
problem
and
under
both
these
methods,
they
sell
the
tba
to
the
dealer
and
they
help
him
sell
it
to
the
public,
and
they
train
him
in
its
use,
that's
identical.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
yes
sir,
the
difference
is
simply
how
the
tba
gets
to
the
dealer,
but
this
difference
is
very
vital
and
it
couldn't
be
better
illustrated
than
by
--
this
case,
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
tba
distribution
to
small
dealers
who
are
buying
in
small
quantities
and
who
are
needing
emergency
deliveries
at
various
times,
is
an
expensive
and
difficult
proposition.
now
atlantic
used
to
do
it
the
way
justice
brennan
described,
that
is
they
had
their
own
warehouses.
they
had
their
own
sub-distributors
and
they
try
--
they
bought
the
--
they
contracted
for
and
bought
the
tba
and
they
distributed
down
to
the
dealers
and
they
lost
a
great
deal
of
money
in
so
doing
and
they
did
not
provide
very
good
service
to
dealers.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
no
your
honor,
that
practice
was
not
attacked
by
the
commission
and
the
exceptions
in
the
commission's
order
as
we
read
them
and
i
believe
there
is
no
dissent
from
this,
allow
us
to
go
back
to
that.
in
other
words,
we
are
allowed
to
go
back
to
an
uneconomic
and
a
--
and
unprofitable
method
of
distribution.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
he
pays
for
them,
your
honor.
this
is
not
a
consignment
case.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
he
pays
--
he
pays
goodyear
either
the
goodyear,
if
he
takes
it
there
are
many
ways
in
the
goodyear
system.
he
pays
goodyear
directly
or
goodyear
dealers
directly,
yes
sir.
and
then
goodyear
in
turn
remits
the
permission
to
us.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
sir?
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
well
the
money
that
we
have
in
it,
your
honor,
is
our
rather
extensive
efforts
to
train
and
help
the
dealer.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
we
pay
that
expense
out
of
our
10%
yes
sir.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
as
the
record
shows,
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
the
commission
didn't
dispute
it.
we
showed
it
i
think
no
one
disputes
the
fact
that
it's
about
break
even
proposition
for
us.
it
cost
us
just
about
as
much
to
provide
the
services
that
we
get
back
in
the
commission
but
least
we're
not
loosing
money
as
we
were
before
and
more
than
this,
your
honor,
our
dealers
are
getting
better
delivery
and
the
example
that
we
used
in
our
brief
is
a
rather
striking
one.
during
the
days
before
1951,
when
we
were
on
sales
commission
--
excuse
me,
on
purchase
resale,
we
provided
a
total
of
six
warehouses
in
our
new
england
district.
five
of
these
were
really
only
suited
to
handle
tires
and
therefore,
the
sixth
was
the
only
warehouse
we
had
for
accessories
and
we
had
a
very
few.
it
was
described
i
think
as
a
handful
of
sub-distributors
who
would
help
us
out
by
having
acting
as
supply
points.
now
when
we
arranged
with
goodyear
for
them
to
do
the
deliveries,
instead
of
us,
our
dealers
instead
of
relying
on
one
warehouse
and
a
few
sub-distributors
had
79
supply
points
from
which
they
could
draw
and
that
meant
every
dealer
had
a
supply
point
close
to
his
station
where
he
could
draw
if
he
wanted.
now,
this
has
been
the
experience
of
most
small
oil
companies
and
while
atlantic
refining
company
is
the
substantial
company,
it
is
a
comparatively
small
company
in
this
business.
it
is
a
regional
company.
it's
confined
to
the
eastern
seaboard
and
extending
back
perhaps
as
far
as
ohio.
it's
spotty
even
along
the
eastern
seaboard.
it
is
not
a
big
powerful
giant.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
the
record
seems
to
show,
your
honor,
that
the
majors
do
and
the
--
this
point
is
made
very
strongly
also
in
the
amicus
brief
that
the
smaller
companies,
those
with
smaller
resources,
find
it
more
convenient
in
effect
to
leave
tba
distribution
which
is
a
pretty
specialized
thing
to
the
tire
companies,
which
who
are
specialized
in
it.
the
larger
companies,
the
big
national
companies,
oil
companies,
can
distribute
on
the
purchase
resale
basis
because
i
think
really
they're
big
enough
to
warrant
setting
up
the
very
expensive
mechanism.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
instead
of
a
dealer
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
your
honor,
that's
a
-
that's
a
question
that
is
suppose
to
be
pass.
we
feel
this.
we
feel
that
under
this
order,
we
cannot
take
the
one
thing
that
is
changed
under
this
order,
we
believe,
is
that
we
can
no
longer
ask
a
goodyear
store
or
hire
upon
a
goodyear
store
to
be
the
supply
point.
and
therefore
i
believe
in
the
exact
example
that
you
gave,
we
could
not
do
that
under
the
order.
i
believe
it
would
be
innovation
to
go
to
this
instance.
now
i
think
i
have
brought
out
to
your
honors,
i
hope
two
things.
first
of
all,
that
this
order
for
this
technical
distinction
that
it
draws
between
sales
commission
and
purchase
resale.
while
it
is
a
technical
distinction
and
a
narrow
one,
it
hurts
by
the
atlantic
refining
company.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
well
i
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
in
number
two
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
in
-
in
number
two,
you
don't
need
the
exception
because
number
two,
prevents
us
from
receiving
any
commission
for
acting
as
sales
commission.
so
you
don't
need
it
there.
that's
obviously
number
two
could
only
apply
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
now
in
number
three,
you
will
find
it
again
toward
the
end,
three
is
using
any
contractual
device
such
as
a
training
program,
promotions,
dealer
meetings,
service
station
identifications
to
sponsor,
recommend,
urge,
induce
or
otherwise
promote
the
sale
of
tba
products
by
any
distributor
or
marketer
other
than
the
atlantic
refining
company.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
yes
sir.
we
--
and
perhaps
i
may
just
as
well
say
your
honor,
that
this
was
not
-
this
isn't
just
inadvertent.
the
arguments
that
i'm
making
to
your
honor
is
here
were
made
to
the
commission.
we
said
to
the
commission,
what
is
there
about
the
sales
commission
plan
which
makes
it
worse?
why
do
you
deprive
us
of
our
economic
and
efficient
system?
and
their
answer
was
--
was
that
there
are
differences
and
this
is
the
best
point
really
that
i
want
to
come
to.
their
answer
was
there
re
differences
and
they
-
they
came
-
they
pointed
out
two
differences.
in
other
words,
when
i
said,
justice
stewart,
and
perhaps
i
should
get
one
step
further,
not
only
did
they
say
there
are
differences
but
they
contemplate
in
their
opinion
that
we
will
return
to
purchase
resale.
and
they
said
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
they
do.
now
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
yes
sir
that's
--
i
have
no
doubt
about
it,
sir.
now
this
brings
us
then
what
is
the
justification
for
the
--
for
this
order
because
it
seems
to
us
the
order
hurts
us
and
while
i
recognize
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
it's
wrong.
certainly
the
commission
should
justify
an
order
which
forces
us
in
practical
effect
undertaking
uneconomic
distribution.
now
what
did
the
commission
added
to
justify?
they
justified
it
on
two
rather
simple
grounds
and
they
were
these.
the
first
ground
is
that
they
felt
that
small
tire
companies,
small
tire
companies
could
not
use
sales
commission.
and
that
therefore,
it
should
be
abolished.
now
the
reason
they
felt
that,
i
believe
was
-
was
confusion
and
perhaps
it
was
a
natural
confusion,
at
the
same
time,
well
perhaps
you
should
go
back
one
step
further.
when
we
were
operating
under
purchase
resale,
we
were
operating
with
a
small
tire
company,
the
lee
tire
&
rubber
company
which
is
a
local
company
in
philadelphia.
and
when
we
changed,
we
not
only
changed
from
purchase
resale
to
sales
commission,
but
we
also
changed
from
the
lee
tire
&
rubber
company
as
our
supplier
to
goodyear.
and
the
commission
apparently
felt
that
those
things
were
--
those
decisions
were
in
someway
tied
together.
they
were
not,
your
honors.
the
reason
we
changed
from
the
small
tire
company
was
simply
that
it
did
not
have
the
public
acceptance.
our
dealers
were
at
a
handicapped
trying
to
sell
the
lee
brand
of
tires
against
the
dealers
of
other
outlets.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
no,
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
that
they
did
not.
however,
your
honor,
in
the
area,
in
our
total
area,
and
our
management
made
the
decision
to
try
to
get
plan
that
they
actually
took
two
plans
that
would
cover
the
total
area,
but
there
is
nothing
to
say
that
lee
didn't
have
adequate
distribution
in
some
small
portion
of
the
area.
and
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
lee
from
offering
us
a
sales
commission
plan
and
the
record
in
effect
they
put
us
in
other
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
but
i
think
it
should
be
clear
your
honor,
that
lee
was
offered
the
opportunity
to
take
a
smaller
portion
still
under
purchase
resale
and
they
turned
it
down.
they
preferred
not
to
and
that
was
a
business
decision
of
theirs,
but
the
point
of
it
is
this,
your
honor.
you
can't
help
the
problem
of
the
small
tire
company
by
trying
to
make
him
stay
married
to
a
small
oil
company.
now
we
-
-
if
we
do
have
to
go
back
to
purchase
resale,
i'm
quite
confident,
your
honors,
that
we
would
not
go
back
with
lee.
we
had
an
unsatisfactory
experience
with
lee
and
we
can't
go
back.
i
don't
believe
we
are
going
to
try
to
do
it
on
our
own
by
selling
an
atlantic
tire
and
therefore
i'm
quite
confident,
your
honors,
that
we
-
we
as
a
small
oil
company,
we
have
to
have
a
national
brand
of
tires.
but
the
point
that
i'm
getting
at
here
is,
it
isn't
the
smallness
of
the
oil
company
or
the
product
of
the
tire
company
which
distinguishes
purchase
resale
from
sales
commission.
lee
had
a
sales
commission
plan
and
we
just
wanted
to
[inaudible]
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
they
do
not
ask
us
to
do
it.
they
give
us
a
reason
for
their
opinion,
the
fact
that
small
oil
companies
are
hurt.
they
can't
compete
with
this
method
but
they
don't
ask
us
to
go
back
to
a
small
oil
company.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
yes
sir,
no
question
about
it.
now
the
second
reason
that
the
commission
gave
is
a
very
interesting
reason.
the
singled
upon
the
only
real
difference
between
the
plans
and
that
is
the
fact
that
in
the
goodyear
plan
there
are
goodyear
stores,
independent
stores,
to
serve
as
supply
points,
sub-distributors
and
that
under
the
sales
commission
plan,
those
goodyear
stores
will
be
eliminated.
they
cannot
under
the
purchase
resale
plan,
use
the
goodyear
stores
to
supply
our
dealers.
now,
we
will
use
other
sub-distributors
but
not
them.
now
the
commission
says
that
this
at
least
and
they
say
at
least,
will
do
something
because
at
least
it
will
eliminate
a
preference
that
those
stores
have,
that's
goodyear
stores.
as
the
commission
expressed
it
they
have
a
chunk
of
business
before
the
competitive
race
begins
and
this
then
when
you
get
down
to
it,
is
what
this
whole
order
must
hang
on
is
did
the
goodyear
stores
get
such
a
chunk
of
business
out
of
our
plan
as
to
make
it
unfair
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
yes
sir,
they
can,
--
under
the
--
that's
perfectly
correct,
your
honor
and
it's
quite
possible
that
many
of
the
dealers
who
have
-
that
if
we
went
to
--
if
we
went
to
purchase
resale
that
many
of
the
dealers
who
have
established
long
standing
relationships
with
those
stores,
will
continue
to
buy
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
we
believe
under
yes,
your
honor.
it
doesn't
require
in
so
many
words
but
the
practical
effect
is
to
require
us
and
we
think
it
means
that
we
must
use
our
own
supply
points.
i
believe
we
can
arrange
for
drop
shipments
from
goodyear
owned
facilities.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
-
i
mean
that's
a
very
normal
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
not
the
independent
ones,
i
believe
your
honor.
we
think
that
this
is
the
very
narrow
point
of
which
it
hangs
and
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
sir?
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
we
believe
we
could
not
use
the
independent
ones
but
we
could
use
the
company
ones.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
yes
sir.
now
just
a
word,
i
think
i
have
pointed
out
that
this
is
a
pretty
narrow
distinction
--
pretty
narrow
point
on
which
to
rest
an
order
of
this
very
sweeping
magnitude,
but
i
wouldn't
point
out
this.
if
this
distinction
means
anything,
it
ought
to
be
by
analogy
to
some
kind
of
a
restraint
of
trade
or
an
acquisition.
in
other
words,
they're
troubled
that
the
goodyear
stores
get
this
chunk
of
business.
now
it
seems
to
me,
your
honors,
that
they
--
that
just
to
say
that
they
have
a
chunk
of
business,
they
require
a
chunk
of
business
is
not
and
they
are
founded
on
the
decisions
of
this
court.
there's
no
measurement
of
that
business,
only
one.
we
know
that
with
that
$6
million
of
tba
pass
through
this
contract
in
a
year.
now,
that's
all.
we
don't
know
what
percentage
that
is
of
anything.
we
don't
know
what
percentage
it
was
for
the
stores.
we
don't
know
what
percentage
it
was
for
the
dealers.
we
don't
know
what
percentage
it
was
for
service
stations.
we
don't
even
know
whether
it
was
profitable.
but
the
commission
says
that
because
they
get
a
chunk
of
business
before
it
races
around,
as
a
result
of
our
sponsoring
in
our
recommendations,
this
makes
that
whole
plan
unfair.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
yes
sir,
goodyear
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
presumably,
your
honor.
yes
and
if
the
goodyear
would
get
the
chunk
of
business
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
it
would
go
out
that
they
would
get
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
that's
right,
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
we
go
out
through
their
own
stores
and
their
own
way.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
no,
we
get
--
we
would
get
--
now
we
would
get
your
honor,
the
profit,
the
profit.
now
whether
and
then
based
on
our
previous
experience,
that
profit
wasn't
enough
to
allow
us
to
the
profit
margin
but
it
wasn't
enough
to
allow
us
to
operate
profitably.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
yes
your
honor
(voice
overlap).
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
oh
certainly.
they
are
now.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
we
wouldn't
get
the
commission
on
their
sales.
that's
right,
your
honor.
we
would
get
a
commission
on
--
we
would
get
a
profit
on
the
sales
that
we
made
through
our
distribution
system.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
and
they
would
be
free,
of
course,
to
-
and
now,
i
may
say
this.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
there
is
a
slight
differentiation.
i
think
that
these
stores
who
now
service
supply
points
have
facilities
--
they
put
in
facilities
and
trucks
relying
on
our
recommendation
and
what
not.
they
may
not
find
it
so
completely
profitable.
they'll
be
happy
as
everybody
is
to
pick
up
our
big
dealers.
but
i
suspect
that
the
little
dealers
will
find
that
these
supply
points
loose
interest
in
them
if
they
don't
have
our
sponsorship
and
recommendation.
it's
the
little
dealer
who
have
the
problem.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
there's
a
very
clear
case,
there
is
a
very
clear
statement
of
it
in
the
seventh
circuit
as
to
the
importance
of
it.
the
seventh
circuit
says
tba
is
an
integral
part
of
service
station
operation.
dealers
must
carry
it
in
order
to
get
complete
service
orders.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
no
sir,
it
doesn't
say
--
it
says
every
major
oil
company
offers
some
kind
of
tba
program.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
your
honor,
we've
given
a
great
deal
of
thought
to
this
and
this
suggestion
is
made,
of
course,
in
the
solicitor's
brief,
solicitor
general's
brief.
we
feel
that
practically
it
does.
i
think
you
can
test
it
very
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
i
don't
believe
they
did,
your
honor.
i
think
this
is
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
i
believe
they
did,
your
honor.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
i
think
they
do,
your
honor.
there
is
one
highly
equivocal
question.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
no
sir,
i
think
they
did
not.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
that's
the
way
we
read
it,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
yes
they
do,
your
honor.
i
believe
that's
right.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
it
was
to
that
paragraph
that
i
was
referring
when
i
told
justice
white,
i
found
that
a
highly
equivocal
paragraph.
i
don't
know
what
it
means.
now
on
the
question
on
what
they
meant
about
purchase
resale,
whether
they
put
it
to
one
side
and
not,
i
think
you
have
--
you
start
with
this,
your
honor.
the
chances
of
supporting
a
complaint,
the
commission
staff
said
to
the
examiner
and
they
said
again
to
the
commission,
you
should
strike
down
both
methods
and
the
commission
reversed
the
appeal
of
the
staff
in
part
and
it
reversed
it
in
that
part
so
it
was
presented
to
the
commission
at
the
beginning.
they
denied
the
appeal,
that's
the
word
i'm
looking
for.
now
in
the
very
early
stages
of
the
commission's
opinion,
i
--
i'm
speaking
now
the
record
as
it
is
before
this
court,
the
commission
took
note
of
this
point.
i'm
reading
on
page
64.
and
on
page
66,
they
said
that
the
purchase
resale
plan
and
the
sales
commission
plan
make
use
of
marketing
facilities
in
different
ways
and
with
different
competitive
effects.
and
then
going
on
to
the
section
that
on
page
126
that
your
honor
is
referring
to,
they
said
assuming
for
the
moment
that
atlantic
will
return
to
the
purchase
resale
plan
and
will
felt
the
antitrust
laws
by
requiring
its
dealers
to
handle
tba
exclusively
or
even
substantially.
so
they're
willing
to
assume
we
were
going
back
and
they
were
willing
to
assume
we
were
going
to
fight
the
antitrust
laws.
they
said
still
there
is
a
difference
and
then
they
wrote
an
order
with
the
specific
exception
and
your
honor,
i
submit
that
they
knew
what
they
were
doing
and
they
intended
to
not
to
allow
us
to
go
back
to
purchase
resale.
i
think
it
would
be
unthinkable
for
them
not
to.
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
quite
right,
quite
right,
your
honor.
that's
right.
we
don't
intend
to
fight
the
antitrust
laws
and
i
--
mr.
frederic
l.
ballard,
jr.
yes
sir,
i'm
sure
they
don't.
now
i
think,
if
your
honors
please,
unless
you
have
anymore
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
