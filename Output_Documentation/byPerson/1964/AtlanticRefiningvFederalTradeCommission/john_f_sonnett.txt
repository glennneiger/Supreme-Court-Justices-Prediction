mr.
john
f.
sonnett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
behalf
of
goodyear
in
a
few
minutes
before
lunch,
may
i
attempt
mainly
to
refer
to
several
of
the
questions
that
were
asked
and
address
myself
to
my
principle
argument
when
the
court
reconvenes
after
lunch,
we
have
about
five
minutes,
i
think.
the
court
will
find
that
in
a
footnote
at
page
46
of
atlantic's
brief
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
atlantic's
brief,
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
smaller
tire
companies
do
have
sales
commission
plans
with
other
oil
companies
and
specifically,
mr.
justice
white,
you
will
find
there
a
reference
to
lee.
it's
the
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
page
46.
with
respect
to
goodyear's
position
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
may
i
say
in
terms
of
the
basic
goodyear
position,
goodyear
will
offer
its
customers
whatever
they
want.
that
is
to
say
if
they
want
to
purchase
resale
plan,
we'll
offer
it
to
them.
if
they
want
sales
commission
plan,
we'll
offer
it
to
them.
if
they
don't
want
to
either
plan,
we'll
try
and
sell
tires
and
batteries,
and
accessories
to
them
anyway.
the
record
in
this
case
establishes
that
when
atlantic
approached
goodyear
back
in
1951,
because
atlantic
had
unhappy
experiences
with
the
-
with
its
purchase
resale
prior
there
too,
goodyear
offered
atlantic
both
plans.
it
offered
atlantic
a
purchase
resale
plan.
it
offered
a
sales
commission
plan.
atlantic
selected
the
sales
commission
plan.
the
order
of
the
commission,
the
final
order,
which
appears
at
the
appendix
pages
114
to
117
has
three
paragraphs
which
relate
specifically
to
goodyear,
the
balance
of
the
order
relates
specifically
to
atlantic.
your
honors
will
find
at
the
bottom
of
page
116
at
the
top
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
your
honor.
you
will
find
the
three
paragraphs
relating
specifically
to
goodyear
which
in
substance
outlaw
the
use
by
goodyear
of
any
sales
commission
plan
or
contract
with
any
oil
marketing
company
of
the
united
states
and
i
believe
there
are
about
156
of
them
regardless
of
size,
regardless
whether
that
oil
company
has
power
to
coerce
dealers,
regard
of
-
regardless
of
whether
it
ever
has
coerced
dealers
and
regardless
of
any
likelihood
that
it
might
coerce
dealers.
in
other
words,
the
goodyear
point
of
view,
goodyear
is
now
put
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
which
is
absolute.
it
may
not
offer
a
sales
commission
plan
to
any
oil
marketing
company
in
the
united
states.
the
record
will
show
that
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
we
had
about
a
dozen
of
the
sales
commission
plans.
we
had
them
with
companies
as
large
as
atlantic
and
we
had
them
with
companies
very
much
smaller,
little
regional
oil
marketing
companies.
your
honors,
will
find
an
amicus
brief
here
by
champlin
which
is
one
of
the
smaller
companies
listing
a
group
of
small
oil
companies
who
need
sales
commission
plans
in
order
to
remain
competitive.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
i
intend,
mr.
justice
douglas
to
concentrate
my
file
after
lunch
on
that
particular
point.
this
is
unusual.
it
is
without
precedent,
i
believe.
i
don't
think,
your
honors
will
find
it
in
any
of
your
prior
decisions
precedent
an
order
of
this
type,
on
this
kind
of
record.
it
goes
beyond
anything
i'm
familiar
with.
in
one
fell
of
swoop
a
sales
commission
plan
used
by
goodyear
alone
so
far
as
the
problems
before
you,
this
is
not
an
industry
wide
horizontal
agreement
case,
nothing
of
that
kind,
but
goodyear
alone
is
forbidden
to
make
a
sales
commission
agreement
with
any
oil
company
of
any
size,
anywhere
in
the
united
states
even
if
the
oil
companies
are
small
and
selling
in
eight
counties
in
some
place
and
wants
it,
even
if
it
has
-
and
one
of
these
has
only
eight
less
lee
dealers
and
then
they
have
20
contract
dealers.
it's
the
sort
of
the
provision
which
i
hope
to
be
able
to
persuade,
your
honors,
after
lunch
is
completely
without
precedent
and
completely
without
reason,
and
not
only
as
without
reason
but
the
commission
has
failed
to
articulate
any
reason.
they
have
a
rational
reason
why
that
drastic
remedy
is
the
appropriate
and
necessary
remedy
to
deal
with
whatever
problems
they
had.
in
respect
to
goodyear's
position
therefore
concerning
the
order,
the
goodyear
urges
that,
your
honors,
vacate
paragraphs
one,
two,
and
three
of
the
final
order
which
relate
to
goodyear
and
also
hat
your
honors,
vacate
paragraphs
one,
two,
three,
and
four
of
the
atlantic
paragraph
because
goodyear
is
indirectly
prevented
by
those
paragraphs
from
having
a
sales
commission
plan
with
atlantic
since
atlantic
is
prevented
from
having
it
with
goodyear.
so
that
we
have
an
interest,
goodyear
has
an
interest
in
one,
two,
three,
and
four
of
the
atlantic
portion
of
the
order
and
in
one,
two,
and
three
of
the
goodyear
portion
of
the
order.
goodyear,
of
course,
raises
no
question
here
with
respect
to
the
paragraphs
five
and
six
of
the
atlantic
order
which
enjoined
any
attempted
coercion
or
coercive
type
pressure
by
atlantic.
atlantic
itself
does
not
see
fit
to
attack
those
provisions
of
the
order
and
we're
confident,
they
will
eliminate
any
coercive
practices
by
atlantic
if
any
fact
is
occurring
something
about
which
goodyear
had
no
knowledge
in
any
event.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will,
may
it
please
the
court,
advance
four
points
on
behalf
of
goodyear.
my
first
point
briefly
stated
is
that
goodyear
is
not
a
transgressor
on
this
record
and
that
it
was
so
found.
my
second
point
is
that
there
was
no
inherent
illegality
in
the
sales
commission
plan
itself.
my
third
point
is
that
the
government's
position
as
to
the
substantive
test
of
illegality
involved
in
this
context
is
i
believe
is
close
to
a
confession
of
error
as
it
could
be
without
expressly
purporting
to
be
so
and
then
applying
what
i
believe
the
government's
substantive
test
of
legality
to
be,
there
is
no
reason
to
sustain
any
provision
of
the
order
except
the
two
provisions
not
in
dispute.
my
fourth
point
has
to
do
with
remedy
and
basically
is
that
in
any
event,
a
remand
would
be
required
because
the
commission
failed
to
consider
alternative
and
less
drastic
remedies
and
failed
to
articulate
a
rational
basis
for
the
remedy
which
was
in
fact
imposed.
as
to
the
first
point,
may
i
invite
your
honors'
attention
to
the
conclusions
of
the
examiner
which
are
at
page
110
of
the
record.
the
first
three
conclusions
are
of
such
vital
importance
that
i
would
like
to
read
them
to
the
court,
110
of
volume
one
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
i
don't
have
the
cross
reference,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
will
try
to
get
it
got
you.
in
any
event
they
have
the
first
three
conclusions
at
the
end
of
the
initial
decision
of
the
examiner
which
read
as
follows.
the
complaint
does
not
charge
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
110
of
volume
one
of
volume
one
of
joint
appendix.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
that
i
take
it
as
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
mr.
justice
black.
yes,
your
honor,
a
16.
the
complaint
does
not
charge
nor
does
the
evidence
introduced
in
this
proceeding
prove
the
existence
of
the
conspiracy
between
goodyear
and
atlantic
to
restrict
and
restrain
competition
in
the
sale
and
distribution
of
tba
products.
second,
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
goodyear
tire
&
rubber
company
or
the
goodyear
tire
&
rubber
company,
inc.
engaged
in
or
participated
in
any
acts
or
any
of
the
acts
or
practices
designed
to
force
dealers
and
distributors
of
the
atlantic
refining
company
to
purchase
goodyear
tba
products.
neither
the
sales
commission
contract
between
atlantic
and
goodyear,
nor
the
contracts
between
atlantic
and
its
dealers
and
distributors,
contain
any
clause
or
provision
requiring
such
dealers
or
distributors
to
purchase
only
goodyear
tba.
those
conclusions
of
the
examiner
led
to
the
examiner's
dismissal
of
goodyear
in
the
proceedings
below.
and
he
found
no
reason
to
impose
any
relief
or
whatsoever
as
to
goodyear
as
a
result
of
the
record
below.
the
commission
approved
the
findings
and
conclusions
of
the
examiner.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
the
commission
approved
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
all
of
them,
mr.
justice
black.
in
so
many
words,
you
will
find
--
i
must
refer
again
to
the
-
the
joint
appendix
volume
1
but
you
will
find
the
--
that
the
commission
in
its
decision
stated
in
so
many
words
--
and
i
read
from
page
187,
substantial
evidence
is
present
in
the
record
of
this
case
to
support
every
finding
of
facts
and
conclusion
of
law
by
the
hearing
examiner.
so
that
i
think
it's
a
fact
statement
of
the
commission
approved
the
conclusions
and
findings
with
respect
to
goodyear.
there
is
nothing
in
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
indicating
any
disapproval
by
that
court
of
the
findings
i
have
just
read
and
conclusions.
so
that
the
matter
comes
to
this
court
i
submit
on
the
basis
of
an
undisputed
record
with
clear
findings
that
goodyear
was
not
a
transgressor
and
goodyear
did
not
participate
in
any
coercive
act.
the
findings
of
coercion,
your
honors,
will
note
which
weren't
made
by
the
examiner
relate
only
and
specifically
to
action
by
atlantic.
so
that
the
only
nexus
between
goodyear
and
any
alleged
unlawful
trade
practice
that
consists
of
the
sales
commission
contract
and
arrangement.
that
leads
me,
may
it
please
the
court
to
my
second
point,
that
there
is
no
inherent
illegality
in
the
sales
commission
plan.
and
that
commission
counsel
indeed
has
heretofore
characterized
the
plan
as
itself
wholly
innocuous.
you
will
find
in
the
proceedings
before
the
commission,
and
i'm
reading
from
page
227
of
this
appendix,
statements
such
as
this
by
counsel
supporting
the
complaint.
these
contracts
are
very
innocuous
in
their
meaning.
these
contracts
are
very
innocuous.
again
at
228
as
i
stated
the
contract
is
very
innocuous.
the
contract
itself
which
your
honors
will
find
at
23
and
98
is
a
contract
which
does
not
require
in
any
sense
of
the
word
the
performance
of
any
action
by
atlantic
except
sales,
promotion
and
assistance.
it
does
not
require
any
coercive
or
tying
action
by
atlantic
or
whatsoever.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
which
is
uncontradicted
is
clearly
to
the
contrary.
because
of
its
importance
in
understanding
what
the
contract
in
fact
was,
i
should
like
to
read
very
briefly
from
a
critical
provision
which
is
found
at
2406
of
this
record.
this
is
a
letter
agreement
which
was
entered
into
between
the
parties,
at
a
time
when
after
testing
the
sales
commission
plan
in
certain
areas,
it
was
decided
to
extend
the
area
and
this
is
their
operative
document
in
that
connection.
your
honors
will
find
that
2406
of
the
record,
the
statement
in
this
letter
as
follows.
at
the
same
time
atlantic,
through
its
field
representatives,
will
begin
assisting
goodyear
in
the
extended
territory
in
the
sale
of
the
products
and
services
outlined
in
said
letter.
with
the
understanding
that
as
has
been
the
practice
in
the
test
area,
our
resale
outlets
shall
be
free
to
choose
whether
and
to
what
extent
they
shall
avail
themselves
of
the
opportunity
to
purchase
goodyear
products
and
services,
and
that
any
resale
outlet
which
chooses
to
carry
products
other
than
goodyear
shall
not
be
prejudiced
in
any
manner.
of
course
we
both
understand
that
our
organization
cannot,
this
is
an
atlantic
letter,
our
organization
cannot
and
will
not
use
any
methods
other
than
salesmanship
to
encourage
our
resale
outlets,
to
purchase
your
products
and
services,
but
that
was
the
state
of
the
record.
that
was
the
understanding
and
agreement
of
the
party.
there
is
no
evidence.
there
is
no
finding
that
there
was
any
side
understanding
for
all
agreement
or
anything
of
a
kind
which
would
have
imposed
a
requirement
on
atlantic
to
coerce
or
to
tie.
the
government's
position
of
illegality
i
submit
to
your
honors
as
set
forth
in
the
government
briefs
at
page
83
purports
to
relate
to
remedy.
briefly
that
test
of
illegality,
i
believe,
is
it
doesn't
relate
to
remedy
at
all
and
i
don't
think
they
seriously
say
that
it
does.
what
they
say
is,
that
a
sales
commission
plan
becomes
illegal.
when
the
plan
is
between
a
major
rubber
company
and
a
major
oil
company,
whatever
that
means.
and
that
the
particular
oil
company
has
the
power
to
coerce
its
dealers
and
has
exercised
the
power,
and
has
demonstrated
a
proclivity
to
exercise
the
power
to
coerce.
that's
the
net
of
their
position
as
to
why
this
plan
they
say
substantively
is
a
violation
of
section
5,
an
unfair
trade
practice
or
an
unfair
method
of
competition.
however,
if
that
test
be
accepted
and
i'm
willing
to
assume
it
for
present
purposes
as
a
correct
test
of
legality,
the
fact
is
that
is
if
it
were
ever
true
of
atlantic,
it's
no
longer
true
because
of
the
injunctive
provisions
atlantic
can
never
again
exercise
the
power
to
coerce.
there
was
no
finding.
there
was
no
basis
for
a
conclusion
in
this
record
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
true
of
any
of
the
other
150
added
oil
companies
in
the
united
states.
and
surely
it
cannot
be
assumed
in
advance
without
a
hearing
that
the
oil
companies
are
going
to
be
so
short
sighted
that
they
will
reconcerntrate,
that
they
are
going
to
coerce
their
dealers
into
taking
sponsored
tba.
there's
no
more
reason
to
deny
their
good
faith
and
advance
than
there
is
to
deny
a
good
faith
of
the
manufacture
of
automobiles.
and
they
have
a
right
in
dealing
with
their
dealers
under
the
statute
to
rely
on
their
good
faith.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
it
is
not.
mr.
justice
white,
there's
a
curious
change
in
position
by
the
government
here.
you'll
find
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes.
i
think
that
fairly
read,
your
honors,
we'll
find
that
the
government's
position
before
this
court
is
radically
different
from
the
position
heretofore
taken
and
i'm
willing
to
take
them
on
their
own
test
and
i
say
on
that
test,
there
is
every
reason
to
vacate
this
order
except
for
the
two
paragraphs
not
in
dispute.
the
last
point
which
i
would
like
to
mention
briefly
is
that,
it
is
clear
from
the
commission's
opinion
that
the
commission
did
not
consider
any
less
drastic
alternative
or
indeed,
consider
any
alternatives.
i
think
the
commission
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
was
under
that
duty.
i
think
the
commission
was
under
the
duty
to
articulate
a
rational
basis
for
the
remedy
which
they
chose
--
the
remedy
which
they
chose,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
to
burn
down
the
house
to
roast
the
pig
or
since
we've
been
hearing
so
much
about
babies
to
throw
the
baby
out
with
the
bath
water.
they
were
under
a
duty
to
consider
and
articulate
other
remedies.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief,
five
or
six
other
possible
alternatives,
any
one
of
which
or
all
of
which
would
have
solve
this
problem.
so
that
if
-
even
if
your
honors
would
agree
as
to
substantive
illegality,
i
submit
to
remand
is
necessary
on
remedy
in
any
event.
i
should
like,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
save
the
remaining
few
minutes
for
replying.
