justice
potter
stewart
you
are
with
that
question
under
the
--
under
the
sanction
of
those
paragraphs
--
justice
potter
stewart
--right
now
that
order?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
you
presume
if
you
do
any
thing
you're
going
to
be
entitled
with
the
federal
trade
commission,
that's
the
end
of
that.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
ballard,
you
-
you
referred
to
me
a
fact
that
there
were
exception
in
each
one
of
the
four
paragraphs
of
the
commission
quarter.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
see
what
you
mean
in
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
be
the
first
and
other
than
the
atlantic
refining
company.
justice
potter
stewart
the
commission
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
you
find
other
the
atlantic
refining
company
down
in
number
four.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
phrase
that
you
meant
when
you
called
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
these
tba
products
had
been
purchased
by
your
client
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
you
and
you
can
do
all
this.
justice
potter
stewart
then
that's
the
purpose
of
observing
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
difference
is
you
wouldn't
get
the
commission.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
question
was
that
this
sort
of
maintenance
in
effect
that
the
--
that
this
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
and
your
independent
dealers
would
be
free
to
deal
with
goodyear.
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
they
are
now,
they
then
would
be
and
that
through
goodyear's
distribution
system
and
then
the
only
difference
is
that
you
wouldn't
get
the
commission.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
tell
me,
they
are
not
allowing
these
principles
because
it
begins
to
their
paragraphs
five
and
six,
wouldn't
that
be
right?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
intend
to
let
you.
justice
potter
stewart
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
that
by
the
contract
that
they
buy
tba
and
has
it
simply
[inaudible]
tba.
it's
talking
about
this
sponsored
tba
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
question
about
their
duty
there
--
justice
potter
stewart
buy
these
tire,
batteries,
and
et
cetera
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
enough,
you
don't
need
more
than
that?
justice
potter
stewart
[inaudible]
dealers'
alleged
statements
to
sellers
and
other
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
a
pressure
put
upon
you.
justice
potter
stewart
that
they
were
under
coercion.
