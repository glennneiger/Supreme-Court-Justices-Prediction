mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
like
to
state
at
the
outset
the
basic
theory
on
which
the
commission
concluded
in
this
case
that
atlantic's
sales
commission
plans
constituted
and
unfair
method
competition
in
violation
of
section
5.
i
don't
think
that's
been
brought
out
very
clearly
by
counsel.
they
rest
it
basically
on
what
i
would
call
free
ultimate
findings
which
the
commissions
make.
the
first
one
was
that
the
atlantic
refining
oil
company
has
sufficient
economic
power
over
its
retail
and
wholesale
distributors
to
coerce
them
to
purchase
a
substantial
amount
of
the
so-called
sponsored
tba.
that's
the
tba
produced
by
goodyear
and
firestone
with
whom
they
had
these
plans
to
cause
them
to
purchase
a
substantial
amount
of
sponsored
tba
even
without
the
use
of
the
coercive
tactics.
now
there
has
been
a
great
deal
to
talk
about
coercion.
the
commission
said
that
coercion
was
merely
symptomatic
of
the
basic
vice
of
these
plans.
the
first
finding
is
that
the
economic
power
that
atlantic
had
over
its
dealers
was
sufficient
to
cause
them
to
you
to
purchase
the
substantial
amount
of
sponsored
tba.
the
second
basic
finding
was
that
atlantic
in
this
case
in
fact
had
used
that
power
to
accomplish
that
objective.
and
the
third
and
critical
finding
is
that
the
result
of
the
exercise
of
this
power
pursuant
to
the
sales
commission
plan,
resulted
in
a
restraint
upon
competition
at
three
different
levels
of
the
tba
business
at
the
retail
level
that
is
the
local
gasoline
distributor,
at
the
wholesale
level,
and
at
the
manufacturing
level.
now
the
thrust
of
my
argument
before
the
court
this
afternoon
will
be
first,
i'm
going
to
persuade
the
court,
i
hope
to
persuade
the
court
that
these
three
ultimate
findings
are
as
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
found
supported
by
substantial
evidence
in
this
record.
and
then
i
shall
show
that
on
the
basis
of
these
ultimate
findings,
the
commission
correctly
concluded
that
these
sales
commission
plans
do
violate
section
5.
and
it
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
mr.
justice
harlan,
let
me
explain
precisely
what
the
commission's
position
is
on
purchase
resale.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
commission
has
expressly
passed
upon
the
legality
of
purchase
resale.
the
commission
has
a
provision
in
its
order
which
in
terms
does
not
make
the
order
applicable
to
purchase
resale
and
therefore
-
and
the
order
as
it
now
stands
they
are
permitted
to
do
that.
that
provision
was
put
into
the
order
because
in
the
appeal
from
the
examiner's
decision,
commission
staff
counsel
asked
for
a
broad
order
that
would
prohibit
purchase
resale
as
well
as
the
sales
commission
plan.
the
commission
declined
to
do
that
and
we
think
properly
because
the
validity
of
the
purchase
resale
plan
has
never
been
litigated
in
this
case.
it
was
not
charged
in
the
complaint
and
the
commission
has
not
--
has
never
passed
upon
the
validity
of
that
plan.
so
that
as
we
--
as
we
view
the
case,
what
we
now
have
is
an
order
prohibiting
the
sales
commission
plan.
the
order
does
not
in
terms
condemn
purchase
resale
because
that
was
not
at
issue.
this
is
a
matter
that
is
open
before
the
commission.
now
we
don't
know
what
type
of
plan
these
people
might
choose
to
adopt
if
this
court
sustains
this
order.
they
may
go
back
to
purchase-resale
as
they
had
it.
they
made
up
some
modified
plan.
they
may,
as
i
shall
come
to
in
a
minute,
eliminate
many
of
the
features
under
the
purchase-resale
plan
which
the
commission
found
bad.
they
may
decide
on
something
else
entirely.
the
record
contains
abundant
evidence
in
this
case
that
there
are
many
wholesale
distributors
of
tba
throughout
entire
--
atlantic's
entire
area
who
were
literally
pounding
on
the
door
of
these
gasoline
stations
and
i
will
show
later
that
one
of
the
complaints
was
that
they
couldn't
get
into
the
door.
that
this
market
was
all
tied
up.
so
we
just
don't'
know
what's
going
to
happen
and
let
me
add
one
other
factor
which
i
think
is
very
important
here.
if
this
court
affirms
and
atlantic
then
wishes
to
try
to
go
back
to
a
purchase-resale
program,
the
way
that's
open
under
the
commission's
rules
of
practice
for
atlantic
to
seek
an
advisory
opinion
from
the
commission
as
to
the
validity
under
the
statute
of
their
any
new
proposal
they
make.
this
commission
just
about
two
years
ago
adopted
a
rule
of
practice
in
which
it
said
that
when
someone
proposes
a
new
method,
a
new
change
in
their
business,
now
they
were
not
given
advisory
opinion
as
to
the
validity
of
an
existing
method
of
business,
but
if
someone
proposes
a
new
method
of
doing
business,
they
can
submit
a
detailed
request
to
the
commission
for
an
advisory
opinion
on
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
this
--
not,
mr.
justice,
this
order
in
terms
permits
them
to
do
it
but
if
they
want
to
find
out
whether
if
they
go
back
to
this
program,
there
is
any
danger
that
the
commission
subsequently
might
challenge
a
purchase-resale
program
and
this
gives
them
an
opportunity
to
get
an
advisory
opinion
in
advance
of
going
back
to
the
program.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think,
mr.
justice,
all
the
commission
order
has
done
in
this
case
is
saying,
we're
not
condemning
it.
they
haven't
purported
to
pass
upon
the
validity
of
the
purchase-resale.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
under
the
terms
of
this
order
but
this
doesn't
bar
the
comi
--
would
not
bar
the
commission
some
future
date
and
if
it
sees
fit
to
bring
another
proceeding
against
this
new
method
of
distribution.
i
mean,
this
is
a
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
we
strike
down
if
i
may
change
a
little
-
we
strike
down
this
method.
we
now
permit
you
to
go
ahead
with
the
other
method
but
the
commission
has
not
made
any
determination
as
to
the
legality
of
the
other
method.
if
i
may
suggest,
mr.
justice,
if
the
commission
would
have
to
bring
a
proceeding
against
another
oil
company
which
is
not
a
party
to
this
and
challenge
their
use
of
a
purchase-resale
method,
i
don't
believe
that
the
other
oil
party
could
say
that
commission
has
already
decided
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that
--
i
think,
mr.
justice,
i
can
always
say
it's
only
a
determination
by
the
commission
that
on
this
record
--
on
this
record
they're
not
going
to
condemn
that
order.
it
might
turn
on
precisely
what
they
propose
to
do
under
the
old
plan,
that
the
constitution
might
be
different.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice,
i
think
it's
a
little
more
than
that.
it's
a
violation
of
the
statute
for
this
company,
these
two
companies,
to
enter
into
this
kind
of
a
contract
which
had
these
particular
facts.
the
commission's
opinion
goes
under
a
great
detail
as
to
the
coercive
impact
of
atlantic's
practices
why
the
dealers
were
coerced,
how
they
were
coerced,
and
i
mean
when
i
say
coerced,
i'm
using
it
in
the
sense
of
not
explicit
coercion,
the
basic
power
that
atlantic
has
in
the
background
over
these
dealers.
and
on
this
basis,
i'm
also
taking
into
account
what
the
impact
of
this
program
was
on
competition,
the
commission
concluded
that
it
was
illegal.
now
depending
on
how
they
were
to
organize
a
sa
--
a
purchase-resale
program,
it
might
or
might
not
have
the
same
effect.
i
would
concede
that
if
we
had
a
sales
commission
pla
---
if
we
had
purchase-resale
plan
that
was
identical
in
every
way,
there's
only
one
respect
as
to
which
that
might
have
a
different
effect
and
that
is
the
impact
on
the
competing
manufacturers
of
tba.
but
in
terms
of
the
pressure,
in
terms
of
the
pressure,
it
would
obviously
the
pressure
would
be
the
same
whether
atlantic
is
selling
its
own
stuff
or
whether
it's
pushing
goodyear
and
firestone
stuff.
we
just
don't
know
how
they're
going
to
do
this.
it
maybe
that
a
purchase-resale
plan,
that
they
would
come
up
with
would
have
a
very
lesser
in
our
competitor.
but
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
get
into
show
actually
what
they
did
in
this
case
and
then
to
suggest
why
there
may
well
be
situations
where
eliminating
some
of
the
things
they
did
in
this
case
would
not
have
the
same
adverse
effect
on
competition
as
the
time
the
commission
condemned.
now
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
we
think
correctly
stated
that
the
heart
of
the
case
is
atlantic's
economic
power
over
its
dealers.
and
they
went
on
and
said
the
keystone
of
the
relationship
between
atlantic
and
its
dealers
are
these
short-term
leases
on
which
to
which
-
under
which
they
lease
the
stations
and
the
short-term
requirements
contract.
this
-
this
gasoline
dealers
are
small
business
in
the
real
sense
of
the
word.
many
of
them
start
business
with
only
a
thousand
dollars.
we
see
in
this
record
a
man
invested
$3000
or
$4000.
they
sometimes
don't
even
have
enough
money
to
pay
for
filling
up
the
gasoline
tanks
when
they
start
business
let
alone
to
buy
the
tires,
the
batteries,
and
all
the
equipment.
so
atlantic
loans
the
money
frequently
with
which
to
open
up
their
station.
the
relationship
between
atlantic
and
its
individual
dealers
is
obviously
not
one
of
equal
bargaining
power.
you
have
a
tremendous
company
on
the
one
hand.
you
have
a
very
small
businessman
who
would
presumably
investing
his
small
life
savings
to
become
an
independent
businessman
and
go
into
business
for
himself.
the
majority
of
these
leases
the
commission
found
run
for
only
one
year
and
while
they're
automatically
renewable,
it's
in
the
sole
discretion
of
atlantic
whether
to
continue
them
in
or
whether
to
cancel
it.
now
the
lease
which
the
dealers
give
it
as
a
form
or
credit
from
which
he
is
told
to
sign
at
the
bottom,
and
sign
somewhere
else,
again,
a
clear
indication
of
the
gross
disparity
in
bargaining
power.
and
only
last
term
in
the
union
oil
case,
this
court
recognized
the
tremendous
power
that
an
oil
company
has
in
getting
its
dealers
to
follow
its
wishes
when
the
dealers
are
so
dependent
upon
it
because
of
the
short-term
leases.
and
the
court
of
appeals
we
think
recognized
the
realities
of
the
situation
when
it
said
that
in
view
of
this
relationship,
recommendation
by
atlantic
is
tantamount
to
command.
they
don't
have
to
coerce
it.
they
don't
have
to
threaten
you
that,
if
you
don't
buy
tba,
we're
going
to
cancel
your
lease
although
when
it
was
necessary
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
sponsored
tba,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
everyone
recognizes
i
think
that
a
gasoline
station
does
have
to
have
tba.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice.
i
should
have
said
sponsored
tba
and
in
this
situation,
the
sophisticated
techniques
that
this
company
uses
is
just
as
effective
to
force
the
dealers
into
buying
this
stuff.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
it
may
-
it
maybe
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
might
-
it
might
be,
mr.
justice
that
you
would
have
enough
in
that
situation
but
in
this
-
on
this
record,
we
are
far
more
than
that.
this
record
we
are
far
more
than
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
the
use
consists
about
-
it
take
me
about
two
minutes
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
the
use
--
mr.
justice,
is
everything
that
atlantic
did
which
i
will
come
to
in
just
a
minute
in
order
to
carry
out
its
obligation
with
goodyear
to
push
the
sales
of
sponsored
tba.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
proposed
it.
that's
our
case.
that's
our
case
which
in
these
four
volumes
is
our
case,
i
think,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
non-coercive
using
the
third
point
is
the
effect
that
non-coercive
use
had
on
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
we
don't
distinguish
that
the
-
we
think
the
overt
act
of
coercion
asymptomatic
with
the
basic
power.
in
other
words
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
instead
of
using
non-coercion,
i
use
pressure.
i
use
pressure
as
distinguished
in
coercion.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
pressure
is
something
less
than
explicit
coercion.
when
i
speak
of
explicit
coercion,
i
mean
where
they
come
in
to
the
man
and
say,
if
you
don't
get
these
tires
out
of
here,
you're
going
to
loose
your
lease,
that's
what
i
call
explicit
coercion.
the
end
result
i
think
is
the
same
on
the
man
whether
they
do
that
or
whether
they
lead
him
to
feel
that
if
he
has
competing
products,
he's
likely
to
be
in
trouble.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
the
power
alone
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
the
power
maybe
coercive
but
in
this
case,
in
this
case
we
have
the
power
and
its
use.
i
don't
-
i
don't
think
i
have
to
take
on
the
more
difficult
case
that
we
didn't
have
the
actual
use
of
the
power.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
power
in
use
meaning
pressure
with
some
coercion,
with
some
coercion.
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
we
don't,
mr.
justice
but
i'll
tell
you
the
figures
we
do
have.
we
do
have
two
sets
of
figures.
we
have
figures
showing
that
in
the
last
year
under
which
goodyear
--
i'm
sorry,
under
which
atlantic
view
as
purchase-resale
plan
the
total
amount
of
tba
that
atlantic
sold
to
its
dealers.
then
we
have
figures
and
that
was
roughly
about
six
million
two,
then
we
have
figures
showing
that
in
the
first
year
of
the
plan,
the
two
companies
combined,
sold
about
eight
million
two.
that's
at
page
76
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
was
the
spo
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
but
we
do
know
this.
we
do
know
there
was
a
dramatic
shift,
dramatic
shift
from
the
purchases
of
the
lee
tires
and
the
exide
batteries
over
to
the
goodyear
at
the
time
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
-
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
suppose
conceivably
-
i
don't
know
a
-
i
don't
know
anything
about
their
relations
with
their
dealers.
all
that
i
can
say
to
that,
mr.
justice,
is
that
beyond
this
record,
that
there
was
one
marked
shift
to
a
very
substantial
sales
amounting
to
about
$50
million
over
the
first
six
years
of
this
program
by
firestone
and
goodyear
to
atlantic.
and
three,
the
evidence
of
a
larger
number
of
competing
wholesalers
that
they
were
unable
to
sell.
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
reasonable
inference
here
that
there
was
very
substantial
segment
of
the
market
tied
up
here,
that
there
was
--
the
[inaudible]
said
that
they
had
fenced
off
a
very
large
part
of
their
market.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
we
don't
know
how
much
if
we
do
the
non-coercion
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think,
mr.
justice
that
it's
the
basic
vice
of
the
plan
itself.
the
plan,
under
the
plan
atlantic
agrees
for
this
fee
to
sponsor
tba
and
it
spells
out
in
considerable
detail
just
what
they
are
supposed
to
do
by
way
of
sponsoring.
it
says
well
a
man
will
call
the
other
and
let
me
just
explain
what
they
did
under
this
plan.
how
this
this
thing
works?
we
start
with
the
fact
that
as
soon
as
the
plan
was
adopted,
atlantic
immediately
announced
to
its
dealers
that
the
plan
was
going
forward.
they
had
atlantic
and
goodyear
representatives
jointly
called
on
the
atlantic
dealers
to
urge
them
to
buy
the
plan.
they
went
around
and
took
down
the
lee
and
the
exide
signs
and
put
up
goodyear
signs,
put
up
firestone
signs,
even
though
the
dealers
didn't
ask
for
them
and
in
some
instances
the
dealers
objected
to
them.
the
record
shows,
if
-
let
me
come
back
to
that,
let
me
go
on
with
it.
then
after
the
plan
was
in
effect,
they
conducted
a
tremendous
pressure
campaign
on
these
dealers.
it
starts
with
a
new
dealer.
when
a
man
-
when
a
man
has
been
selected
as
a
possible
new
dealer,
he's
subjected
to
three
interviews
before
they
select
by
the
salesman,
by
the
supervisor,
and
by
the
district
manager.
in
each
instance,
they
emphasize
to
him
that
atlantic
has
a
tba
program
and
that
atlantic
wants
him
to
carry
it
out.
then
he
goes
to
the
school.
they
run
a
school.
they
give
him
five
weeks
instruction
course
on
how
to
run
the
service
station.
at
the
school,
again,
there
are
demonstrations
of
tba.
it's
always
the
sponsored
tba.
they
give
the
company,
the
tire
company's
advance
notice
when
a
new
dealer
is
about
to
open
his
service
station,
they
give
him
advance
notice
so
that
these
companies
can
come
in
and
get
the
initial
order
which
is
a
large
order
to
stock
at
the
station.
they
take
them
around
and
introduce
them
to
the
dealer.
the
dealer
has
bought
in,
it
is
just
assumed
as
one
of
the
witnesses
testified
at
the
school
that
when
you
open
your
station,
you're
going
to
buy
this
from
the
stocking
point,
from
the
goodyear
or
firestone
supply
point.
and
then
the
salesman
from
atlantic
continues
to
come
around
with
the
salesman
from
the
tire
company,
the
salesman
from
atlantic
take
the
orders
and
the
record
shows
that
when
the
atlantic
salesman
sees
other
products
in
there,
they
constantly
criticize
them.
they're
saying,
what
are
you
doing
with
this
thing
here
and
the
whole
thing
just
feels
a
tremendous
pressure
on
the
dealer
that
he
in
effect
is
no
longer
has
the
basic
freedom
of
choice.
he
feels
under
this
pressure
considering
that
atlantic
is
behind
him
with
this
tremendous
economic
power
that
keep
punching
home
to
him,
take
this,
take
this,
take
this
and
he
really
feels
that
he
doesn't
have
freedom
of
choice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
is
coerced.
he
is
coerced
in
fact,
in
fact,
he
is
coerced.
i
guess
like
if
i
may
to
read
to
the
court
so
they
can
get
a
little
of
the
flavor
of
this
case.
some
of
the
statements
that
were
made
to
wholesalers
who
tried
to
come
in
and
sell
competing
products
to
atlantic
dealers.
now
these
are
all
references
to
the
atlantic
record
which
is
number
292,
there
are
two
records
in
the
case.
they
are
largely
duplicated
but
i
attached
in
here
the
atlantic
record.
the
first
instance
it's
set
fort
in
page
237
of
the
record,
a
wholesaler
in
pennsylvania
came
to
a
dealer
and
wanted
to
sell
him
a
polish
called
wiz
which
was
not
one
of
the
sponsored
products
and
the
dealer
said
to
him
when
he
asked
him
about
this
coat,
sorry
glen,
but
i
have
to
reserve
this
for
ed
paris.
ed
paris
parenthetically
was
the
supply
point
to
which
the
goodyear
particular
dealer
-
i'm
sorry,
the
atlantic
dealer
was
assigned,
the
goodyear
supply
point.
and
the
importance
of
that
is
that
under
the
plan,
under
the
plan,
atlantic
only
receives
the
commission
on
goodyear
products
sold
through
a
goodyear
supply
point.
that
is
if
the
dealer
buys
goodyear
tires
but
not
from
the
supplied
point
to
which
he
is
assigned,
atlantic
doesn't
get
a
commission.
it's
not
just
that
you
have
to
buy
goodyear
but
have
to
buy
this
for
the
goodyear
supply
point.
and
he
said,
i
have
to
reserve
this
for
ed
paris.
you
understand
the
situation.
i'm
in
an
atlantic
station.
i
must
buy
from
an
atlantic
tba
distributor.
then
here's
another
example
at
page
556.
another
wholesaler
asked
the
dealer,
i
asked
him
if
he
would
buy
some
exide
batteries
and
you
says,
he's
not
allowed
to
buy
them.
i
offered
him
a
polish
and
if
it
is
in
order,
i
will
say
the
polish
was
$4
below
the
price
of
atlantic's
price
for
this
and
he
said
i
wish
i
could
buy
these
deals
but
i'm
not
allowed
to.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
this
is
in
addition
to
the
coercion.
the
coercion
evidence
is
the
evidence
of
individual
dealers.
the
testimony
is
the
dealers
who
were
called,
who
testified
they
were
threatened
for
the
cancellation
of
a
lease
when
they
refused
to
buy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
of
other
of
competing
lines,
that's
right.
they're
in
addition
to
this
material.
i'm
not
going
to
bother
the
court
with
it.
the
examiner
in
his
decision
set
forth
13
specific
instances
of
the
dealers
who
testified
as
to
the
pressure
put
upon
them.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
coercive
pressure
--
coercive
pressure.
perhaps,
that's
of
lease
cancellation.
these
are
however
are
instances
in
which
various
dealers
who
refuse
to
purchase
from
wholesalers
explain
to
wholesalers
that
they
felt
that
they
were
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
were
under
coercion
(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
but
--
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
he
said
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice,
may
i
again
refer
in
the
last
statement.
he
said
he's
not
allowed
to
do.
he's
not
allowed
to
do
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
let
me
explain
--
come
to
that.
the
record
at
the
time
it
was
before
the
commission
showed
that
goodyear
had
contract
with
either
[inaudible]
other
oil
companies.
the
commission
found
that
the
sales
commission
plan
is
a
violation
of
section
5.
the
commission
had
before
it
in
this
record
evidence
dealing
with
coercive
or
pressured
tactics
by
three
of
the
eight
or
ninth
companies.
the
commission
also
found
that
the
sales
commission
plan,
the
contracts,
that
goodyear
had
with
these
other
companies
where
in
order
to
all
respect
identical
with
this
-
most
of
them
with
the
same
kind
of
letters.
they
obligate
the
oil
companies
to
do
the
same
kind
of
thing.
and
that
the
commission
i
think
reasonably
concluded
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
of
coercion
but
it
adds
the
three
of
the
none
--
that
it
was
not
unreasonable
to
assume
that
these
other
plans
were
likely
to
have
the
same
effect.
the
evidence
by
the
way
-
the
evidence
is
quite
the
same
kind
of
evidence
that
we
have
dealing
with
atlantic's
dealers.
i
would
like
us
to
refer
to
a
very
dramatic
example
which
is
given
in
the
record.
now
this
is
-
this
is
not
printed
in
the
atlantic
record,
this
is
in
the
goodyear
record
but
it's
also
referred
to
in
the
commission's
opinion
involving
a
dealer
named
mcmaster
and
i
want
to
go
beyond
the
commission's
opinion
because
it's
amplified
a
little
more,
it's
at
pages
11-12
to
11-13
of
the
goodyear
record.
mcmaster
was
a
dealer
of
sinclair,
a
lesse
dealer,
who
had
a
sinclair,
of
course,
had
an
agreement
with
goodyear
and
one
day,
mr.
mcmaster
who
had
been
purchasing
a
rival
brand
of
batteries
called
bauers
was
summoned
down
to
the
goodyear
office.
and
as
the
conversation
went,
they
called
him
into
the
office
and
there
were
three
men
sitting
there
and
one
said,
mr.
mccall,
he
said,
we
will
make
this
brief
mac.
you
are
not
buying
batteries
from
us
and
mcmaster
said,
no,
he
was
not
buying
batteries
that
he
couldn't.
he
had,
during
the
war
and
just
after
the
war,
batteries
were
in
short
supply,
had
been
able
to
get
them
from
bauers
and
that,
that
they
have
promised
the
bauers
company
in
return
have
given
them
their
business,
and
went
on.
and
the
require
was,
and
the
almost
exact
words
were
we
don't
give
a
god
damn
who
you
think
you
are.
you
are
going
to
buy
our
batteries
or
else.
and
by
our
batteries,
we're
referring
to
goodyear
and
then
the
question.
thereafter,
did
you
continue
to
buy
bauers
batteries?
answer.
no,
not
for
very
long
because
i
knew
what
the
or
else
meant.
question.
what
did
it
mean
to
you?
the
man
cancellation
of
my
lease
the
next
time
it
came
up
for
a
new
one?
so
that
what
we
have
in
this
record
as
far
as
goodyear
is
concerned
is
the
instances
of
three
companies
with
whom
they
were
doing
-
who
were
doing
the
same
kind
of
pressures.
and
we
also
have
indications
in
the
record
at
least
two
of
the
companies
had
short-term
leases
and
we
have
evidence
in
the
record
showing
that
most
of
the
oil
companies
do
employ
a
short
term
lease
and
this
is
the
basis
on
which
we
think
that
commission
was
justified
in
entering
the
court
order
against
goodyear.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they're
not
contested.
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think,
mr.
justice,
that
those
facts,
all
those
basic
underlying
facts
are
of
importance
in
analyzing
the
theory
on
which
the
commission
decided
the
case.
now
it's
these
facts
which
it
seems
to
us,
put
some
meat
on
the
bones
of
this
case.
this
case
is
not
an
abstraction
in
question
of
coercive
power.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
record,
we
think,
dramatically
illustrates
not
only
the
power
but
its
use
that
pursuant
to
this
agreement
--
this
is
-
this
is
we
think
basically
what
goodyear
bought.
this
is
what
goodyear
paid
10%
for.
they've
agreed
to
give
them
10%
of
what
goodyear
sell
to
atlantic
and
return
for
atlantic
bringing
its
power
to
them.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
this
is
what
they
did.
if
this
is
what
they
did,
mr.
justice,
i
very
much
doubt
without
the
commission
whether
they
would
have
done
it.
if
it
is
without
the
-
if
they
did
the
same
thing,
i
think
we
have
the
same
case.
if
there
was
a
contract,
then
they're
just
going
to
try
to
do
it.
this
is
the
one
other
factor
i
think
that's
very
important
to
mention
here
in
connection
with
this
plan
that
i
want
to
just
refer
to
which
is
this.
in
terms
of
how
effective
atlantic
was
in
getting
its
dealers
to
go
along
with
this
plan.
in
1948
and
1949,
when
atlantic
was
still
using
the
purchase-resale
plan,
made
a
survey
of
seven
--
of
service
station
dealers
of
seven
different
companies
to
find
out
what
their
tie-up
preferences
were.
now
under
this
survey,
67%
of
the
atlantic
dealers
announced
that
they
preferred
the
lee
tires
and
79%
preferred
exide
batteries.
these
were
the
two
products
which
they
were
then
handling
under
the
purchase-resale
plan.
only
11%
preferred
goodyear
and
only
4%
preferred
firestone.
that
was
in
1947
and
1948.
in
1951,
when
the
plan
went
into
effect,
by
the
end
of
the
year,
lee
and
exide,
the
two
companies
which
previously
had
been
connected
with
the
purchase-resale
plan
had
lost
75%
of
their
business
which
they
previously
had
with
the
atlantic
dealers
as
a
result
of
this.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
know,
mr.
justice
whether
it
would
or
wouldn't
have.
of
course,
what
we
have
in
the
case
is
the
coercive
thing.
in
other
words,
if
we
didn't
have
any
instances
of
coercion,
all
we
had
--
well,
if
all
they
did
was
to
enter
into
a
contract
and
then
goodyear
wrote
letters
to
its
dealers
saying
we
have
find
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
for
five
-
five
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--five
and
six,
mr.
justice,
five
and
six
as
we
understand
it,
are
not
addressed
to
such
things
as
having
the
atlantic
salesman
take
the
orders
as
having
the
atlantic
salesman
to
-
if
it
wouldn't
just
find
-
well
if
it
were
just
that,
of
course,
if
it
were
just
that,
the
reason
i'm
frankly
reluctant
to
say
that
it
would
just
that
alone
as
i'm
not
sure
whether
if
that's
all
you
had
we've
been
entitled
to
the
broader
order.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no,
mr.
justice,
the
order
that
would
merely
prohibit
the
coercive
practices,
it
seems
to
us
would
be
inadequate
because
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
an
inadequate
remedy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
for
the
--
for
the
vice,
that's
right.
that
would
not
clean
the
thing
up.
that
would
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
--
just
don't
know
with,
mr.
justice,
whether
without
any
evidence
of
coercion
as
i
use
it
pressure
in
that
sense,
i
would
think
it
would
be
very
doubtful
whether
we
--
the
commission
would
have
brought
this
case.
but
again,
i
don't
know
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think
mr.
justice,
i
think
mr.
justice,
the
commission's
opinion
does
-
does
reflect
this
theory.
i'd
like
to,
if
i
may,
come
back
to
refer
to
very
specific
findings
of
the
commission
here.
the
first
finding
is
at
page
-
and
this
again
to
the
atlantic
record.
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
have
it
paginated.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
page
64
b.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
but
i
think
i
could
find
that,
mr.
justice.
page
64
of
the
atlantic
record
is
page
b4
of
this
-
b4
of
this.
and
about
the
first
full
paragraph
of
b4
around
the
third
sentence,
beginning
define
that
atlantic
has
in
fact
coerced
at
certain,
we
further
find
that
atlantic
has
sufficient
economic
power
over
wholesale
and
retail
distributors
to
coerce
in
the
purchase
substantial
amounts
of
sponsored
tba
even
without
the
use
of
overt
coercive
tactics.
that's
the
power
point
and
the
same
basic
power
pointing
which
repeated
at
124
which
i'm
afraid
i'm
not
able
to
paginate
to
this.
maybe
i
can
get
that?
then
the
commission
go
-
i'm
sorry,
i
can't
find
that
in
this
page.
at
page
122,
it
makes
the
finding
that
atlantic
has
used
the
power
as
a
major
wholesale
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
there
--
there
double
find
-
the
two
findings
as
the
first
finding
that
they
are
actually
coerced.
first
of
the
finding,
they
actually
coerced
deal
by
threats
to
at
least
cancel
it
and
then
they
find
that
without
that
actual
coercion
they
nevertheless
had
specific
power
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think
again
of
the
commission,
the
commission
said
that
it
would
go
out
of
the
coercion
as
merely
symptomatic
of
the
basic
vice
of
the
plan.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
they
say
the
acts
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
said
they
exercise
the
power.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
through
the
use
of
the
sales
commission
plan.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
no,
i
think
they
have
to
do
more
than
sign.
if
they
have
to
do
sign
up,
and
then
they
have
to
use
the
power.
no,
they
merely
signed
it
up
and
didn't
do
anything,
but
i
think
that
the
plan
-
i
think
that
the
-
the
contract
requires
them
to
use
these
powers.
the
record
shows
they
have
used
the
power.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think
mr.
justice,
it
maybe
to
some
extent
a
semantic
problem
because
when
you
say
this
type
of
contract
and
when
they
speak
of
this
type
of
contract,
they
mean
this
contract
as
the
record
shows
that
we
view
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now
that's
(voice
overlap)
that's
said,
mr.
justice,
that
the
overt
act
of
coercion
were
mere
as
instances.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
i
think
what
the
commission
was
really
saying
is
that
when
you
have
this
relationship
between
an
oil
company
and
its
dealers
and
when
you
have
this
agreement
by
which
the
oil
company
agrees
to
sponsor
the
thing,
that
the
inevitable
effect
of
this
is
to
believe
this
kind
of
pressure.
now
i
think
what
happens
to
the
coercion
is
that
when
the
salesman
finds
that
he
cannot,
by
normal
means,
persuade
the
deal
to
buy
this
stuff,
he
eventually
begins
to
put
a
little
more
and
a
little
more
pressure.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it
does,
mr.
justice,
but
i
just
want
to
emphasize
this,
that
this
finding,
this
conclusion,
is
not
made
in
the
abstract.
this
is
made
on
the
basis
of
this
record.
the
commission
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
system
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
--
that's
right.
the
pressure,
in
other
words,
the
very
nature
of
the
thing,
the
very
nature
of
the
obligations
of
atlantic
assumes
these
themselves
generate
these
pressures
which
atlantic
and
few
of
its
relationship
with
its
dealers
is
not
reluctant
to
you.
it
puts
pressure
not
only
the
suggestion
to
subtle
things
made
the
deals,
of
course,
they
didn't
have
to
club
them.
i
need
dealers
who
are
well
aware
of
the
relationship
and
when
they
were
said,
why
don't
you
buy
our
product,
we
do
it.
if
i
may
just
throw
an
analogy,
mr.
justice,
it's
a
quite
different
feel.
if
you
had
a
commanding
general
on
an
army
post
and
you
had
a
second
-
second
lieutenants
and
the
general
called
on
each
one
of
the
men
and
said
now
lieutenant,
this
is
completely
voluntary,
it's
up
to
you
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
nice
thing
if
you
gave
$10
to
the
american
red
cross,
that's
all
he
said.
it's
completely
voluntary.
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
i
-
i
mean
if
this
is
-
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
--
unfortunately,
i
was
only
enlisted
man
so
i
never
had
that
kind
of
offer
made
to
me
but
again
it's
the
reality
and
this
is
the
way
things
work.
this
is
-
this
is
what
you
have
in
the
business
world
-
in
the
world
generally.
and
-
and
the
vice
in
this
thing,
the
vice
in
this
thing
as
we
see
it
is
that
it
brings
together
the
oil
company
and
the
tire
company.
the
oil
company
has
this
power.
the
tire
company
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
effect
buys
the
captive
market.
the
oil
company
can
put
pressure.
they're
able
to
sell
a
tremendous
amount
of
stuff,
$50
million
worth
over
six
year
period.
they
paid
them
a
very
substantial
-
an
output.
and
i
just
like
to
refer
to
one
thing
that
mr.
sonnett
said
about
goodyear
not
being
a
transgressor.
because
goodyear,
in
this
case,
didn't
just
signed
the
contract
and
then
shipped
tires,
it
did
more
than
that.
the
goodyear
salesman
went
around
with
the
atlantic
salesman.
the
goodyear
representatives
participated
in
the
demonstrations
that
were
done.
the
goodyear
people
went
around
and
removed
the
signs
of
the
competing
products.
goodyear
reported
to
atlantic
the
names
of
oil
dealers
at
the
early
stage
where
it
couldn't
put
the
signs
in.
and
the
findings
to
which
mr.
sonnett
referred,
the
commission's
finding
that
every
one
of
the
examiner's
findings
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
that
finding
was
made
not
in
a
general
statement
as
to
what
it
was
doing
with
the
examiner's
report.
that
statement
was
made
in
response
to
the
specific
argument
that
the
examiner
in
this
case
had
been
prejudiced
because
he
relied
on
evidence
he
had
heard
in
the
companion
case
and
he
wasn't
rejecting
that
that
the
commission
made
the
statement
of
the
examiner's
finding
is
supported
by
evidence.
so
what
all
that
means
is
that
the
examiner's
findings
in
this
case
to
the
extent
they
were
proved
were
supported
by
evidence
in
this
case.
and
at
page
131
of
the
atlantic
record
in
the
commission's
final
order
in
this
case
the
third
paragraph
says,
he
has
ordered
that
the
findings
and
conclusion
of
the
initial
be
in
here
by
our
modified
and
supplemented
to
conform
to
the
findings
and
conclusions
that
you
have
set
forth
in
this
opinion.
so
that
the
-
to
the
commission
only
adopted
the
examiner's
findings
to
the
extent
that
those
findings
conformed
to
the
commission's
decision
to
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
i
suppose
if
you
had
just
the
contract
standing
alone,
you
couldn't
say
that
on
its
face
this
is
fit.
it
depends
what
they
would
do
about
it
and
this
comes
back
to
my
other
suggestion
which
i'd
made
early
in
the
argument
as
to
purchase-resale.
i'd
like
to
come
back
to
that
now.
a
purchase-resale
plan
might
or
might
not
have
comparably
adverse
effect
on
competition.
it
depends
on
what
they
did.
if
all
that
atlantic
were
to
do,
if
this
court
affirms
the
order
was
to
announce
that
henceforth,
it
will
have
available
for
those
dealers
who
wanted
tba
supplies
and
dealers
are
free
to
purchase
what
they
see
fit,
that
there's
no
obligation
if
it
didn't
have
its
salesman
going
out
and
pushing
its
own
line,
if
it
didn't
what
they
call
double
teaming
that
is
going
out
with
the
goodyear
men
and
supplying
them,
if
it
didn't
give
goodyear
the
entree
every
time
a
new
dealer
opens
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
the
contract
is
specifically
does
refer
to
that.
yes,
23
--
23
60
of
the
atlantic
record
and
volume
4.
yes
at
page
2361,
you
will,
from
time
to
time
at
our
mutual
convenience
have
your
representative
call
upon
these
customers,
that's
the
atlantic
customers,
in
company
with
our
salesmen.
and
throughout
this
business,
generally
vague
language
which
on
its
face
seems
probably
unobjectionable
--
objectionable
but
see
that
your
field
officers
work
energetically
with
us
to
assist
us
the
fullest
practical
extent
in
perfecting
sales
and
credit.
your
field
representatives
will
suggest
to
these
customers
as
the
maintenance
of
adequate
stocks
of
merchandised
purchasing
from
us,
and
we'll
counsel
them
as
to
the
maintenance
of
proper
identification
and
advertising
with
respect
thereto.
well
the
record
shows
that
such
council
as
to
proper
maintenance
of
proper
identification
and
advertising
not
to
advertise
competing
product.
that's
what
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
let
me
-
let
me
explain
that,
mr.
justice.
first
as
to
the
difference
between
150
and
the
eight
or
nine.
the
150
as
i
understand
of
the
number
of
oil
companies
who
were
in
the
business
with
whom
goodyear
might
potentially
have
contract.
the
eight
or
nine
are
the
ones
that
the
record
shows
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
with
whom
goodyear
actually
had
contract.
now
the
commission
found
that
the
contracts
that
goodyear
has
with
these
other
oil
companies
are
the
same
form
identical
in
numerous
instances
as
the
contract
it
had
with
atlantic.
in
other
words,
i'm
sorry
i
have
to
correct
it,
no,
it
did
so
find
-
it
did
so
find
it.
in
other
words,
in
effect,
these
contracts
obligated
the
other
oil
companies
to
do
the
same
kind
of
thing
with
atlantic
had
done.
it
also
found
that
at
least
just
the
two
of
these
nine
companies
that
they
do
have
this
short
term
lease,
shell
and
sherwood,
had
short-term
lease,
it
also
found
that
evidence
in
the
record
that
as
to
three
of
these
eight
or
nine
companies,
there
were
similar
pressures
used
by
these
companies
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
actual
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
if
there
-
it
seems
to
me
the
commission
having
found
that
this
having
made
findings
as
to
the
system,
the
operation
of
a
plan
between
goodyear
and
atlantic
having
found
that,
had
then
found
that
goodyear
had
similar
arrangements
with
eight
or
nine
other
companies.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
therefore,
it
seems
to
us
it's
not
unreasonable
for
the
commission
to
conclude
in
formulating
its
relief.
enough
had
been
shown
to
justify
a
ban
against
the
use
of
any
of
these.
and
i
may
say
that
if
in
fact,
if
in
fact
there
should
be
some
particular
company
with
whom
goodyear
wants
to
or
has
a
plan
where
there
are
not
any
of
these
features.
a
goodyear
is
always
free
to
come
back
to
the
commission
to
seek
a
modification
to
it.
let
me
just
post
this
specific
case.
there's
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case
filed
by
the
shell
oil
company.
the
commission
--
this
is
one
of
the
three
companion
cases
brought
against
this
tba
system.
if
this
case
--
there's
another
one
brought
against
the
texaco
company
and
the
goodyear
tire
&
rubber
company
which
was
set
aside
by
the
dc
circuit
depending
on
certiorari,
there's
a
third
case
now
pending
on
the
fifth
circuit
which
has
not
yet
been
decided
involving
firestone
on
the
one
hand
and
shell
on
the
other.
and
shell
also
has
a
contract
with
goodyear.
shell
says,
well
this
is
most
unfair.
the
commission
has
an
order
against
goodyear
protecting
our
--
which
prohibits
goodyear
from
carrying
out
its
agreement
with
us.
perhaps
in
the
fifth
circuit,
we
may
win
that
case
and
the
fifth
circuit
may
hold
that
our
agreement
with
goodyear
is
alright
because
presumably
on
its
theory
that
shell
wouldn't
have
this
economic
power.
well
if
the
fifth
circuit
holds
that,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
way
is
open
to
goodyear
to
come
back
to
the
commission
and
say,
now
here's
a
particular
case
where
the
finding
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
the
basis
of
your
decision
does
not
exist
here.
therefore,
we're
entitled
to
a
modification
as
far
as
this
particular
contract
is
concerned.
but
this
seems
to
me
and
gives
them
an
out
in
effect,
if
as
to
particular
case,
they
can
prove
that
the
commission
was
in
error
in
pretending
in
entering
in
the
court
order.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
not
a
basis
--
this
possibility
is
not
a
basis
for
saying
that
the
most
the
commission
could
do
in
this
case
was
to
cancel
the
agreement
between
goodyear
and
atlantic.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon
sir?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
the
broch
order
was
a
little
different
problem.
the
broch
order
was
there
had
been
true
of
a
discrimination
with
one
customer
and
the
commission
added
an
order
prohibiting
a
similar
brokerage
rebate
with
any
other
buyer
or
seller.
the
seventh
circuit
struck
out
the
provision
extending
it
to
any
other
buyer
or
seller
and
this
court
reinstated
it
so
the
commission
was
entitled
to
that.
that's
perhaps
-
i've
read
this
just
with
the
broch
case,
perhaps
it's
a
closer
analogy
to
the
question
of
whether
it
could
prohibit
the
order
with
atlantic
because
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
a
perfect
analogy
for
the
atlantic
contract.
the
commission
found
that
atlantic's
agreement
with
goodyear
was
illegal
and
the
atlantic's
agreement
with
firestone
was
illegal.
it
seems
to
me
both
that
the
broch
case
is
perfectly
thought
in
saying
in
those
circumstances
the
commission
could
also
prohibit
atlantic
from
entering
into
similar
contracts
with
other
tire
companies.
but
i
think
--
i
figure
it
gives
some
help
to
us
but
basically
it's
more
on
the
general
theory
that
if
they
find
that
a
person
has
violated
the
law
and
there
seems
to
be
a
reasonable
basis
to
believe,
that
other
practices
are
comparable
that
that
too
can
be
prohibited
as
an
exercise
of
the
commission's
discretion.
now
i
just
like
very
briefly
to
refer
which
i
haven't
come
to
yet
but
the
basic
theory,
legal
theory
on
which
the
commission
said
this
is
an
unfair
method
of
competition,
it's
by
really
by
analogy
to
the
tying
cases,
the
commission
found
that
the
effect
of
this
agreement
was
to
limit
the
opportunities
for
the
retail
gasoline
dealers
to
purchase
where
they
felt
that
they
wanted
to
purchase,
it
limited
the
opportunities
of
the
wholesalers
to
sell
and
it
limited
the
opportunities
of
competing
manufacturers
to
sell
in
this
market.
and
the
end
result,
the
end
result
of
this
it
seems
to
me
in
terms
of
the
effects
on
competition
is
basically
the
same
adverse
consequences
to
which
this
court
has
alluded
to
in
the
tying
cases.
to
paraphrase
the
language
of
the
tying
cases,
that
the
effect
of
this
agreement
is
that
at
the
retail
level,
the
gasoline
dealer
is
--
makes
his
purchases
not
on
the
basis
of
his
independent
judgment
that
this
is
what
he
wishes
to
buy,
but
because
atlantic
with
its
power
in
the
gasoline
business
is
putting
the
pressure
on
him
to
buy
another
kind
of
product.
now
i
think
there's
a
very
dramatic
illustration
of
this
kind
of
pressure
in
this
record.
the
two
witnesses
who
testified
that
even
though
they
could
have
bought
the
identical
product,
the
goodyear
tire
from
another
goodyear
dealer
at
less
money
than
they
had
to
pay
at
the
goodyear
supply
point,
they
nevertheless
felt
obligated
to
buy
from
a
goodyear
supply
point.
but
there's
-
there
could
be
no
question
in
those
cases
that
it'd
be
in
a
different
product
that
was
cheaper
was
inferior,
it
was
the
identical
product
and
here
you
have
this
supposedly
independent
businessman
who
pays
more
for
the
identical
product
than
he
could
have
gotten
it
elsewhere
because
of
this
plan.
those
are
the
two
witnesses
that
i
would
like
to
cite
them
in
our
brief
there
at
pages
634
and
644
and
652
of
the
atlantic
record.
now
in
the
other
--
the
other
point
of
view
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
wholesalers
of
tba,
they
too
are
foreclosed
from
this
substantial
market
covered
by
the
sales
commission
plan.
there
is
testimony
of
wholesale
after
wholesaler
who
have
testified
that
he
just
couldn't
make
any
in
rows
in
this
market.
and
indeed,
the
most
remarkable
thing
about
this
is,
these
wholesalers
by
and
large
indicated,
they
could
sell
to
the
atlantic
service
stations
products
not
covered
by
the
sales
commission
plan.
there
were
certain
types
of
automatic
--
automotive
parts
particularly
things
they
use
in
repair
works
so-called
[inaudible]
were
not
covered
by
the
sales
commission
plan.
they
were
able
to
sell
those,
but
they
testified
that
when
they
try
to
sell
the
atlantic
dealers
the
products
that
were
covered
by
the
sales
commission
plan,
that's
when
they
ran
up
against
the
stone
war.
they
could
sell
them
on
a
filling
basis.
if
occasionally
a
particular
dealer
needed
a
battery
and
hurry
for
customer
and
his
supply
point
couldn't
supply,
that's
what
they
could
sell
but
they
couldn't
come
in
and
sell
the
man
a
stock
of
these
products.
now
so
that
the
end
result
of
this
is
that
the
plan
operates
has
the
same
effect
on
competition
as
a
time
plan.
now
when
congress
passed
the
federal
trade
commission
act
in
1914
and
it
intentionally
left
it
to
the
commission
to
fill
down
the
basis
of
accumulating
--
accumulating
experience
in
expertise
just
what
were
the
unfair
methods
of
competition
is
above.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i'm
not
sure,
mr.
justice.
it
would
depend
i
suppose
on
the
precise
details
of
what
they
were
to
do.
i
don't
know
whether
that
particular
suggestion,
what
would
the
commission
react
into
that
would
be
i
was
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
they're
--
they're
conceivably
might
but
again
it
would
depend
on
precisely
what
the
modifications
were
i
would
think.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
we
don't
go
that
far.
we
don't
--
all
we
have
is
this
plan.
i
don't
know
what
plans
and
another
thing,
i
suppose
the
more
you
reduce
the
things
that
the
oil
companies
going
to
do
under
the
program,
the
less
attractive
the
program
is
going
to
be
in
the
tire
company.
at
some
point
it
seems
to
me
the
tire
company
will
say,
there's
no
point
in
paying
these
commissions,
we're
not
getting
anything.
now
whether
in
fact
these
various
changes
would
have
the
result
of
making
the
plan
so
unattractive,
i
don't
know,
but
again
i
think
it
would
turn
largely
on
precisely
to
what
extent
they've
eliminated
these
and
there's
something
i
should
say.
during
the
operation
of
this
plan,
and
if
i
may
just
continue,
during
the
operation
of
this
plan
atlantic
put
out
various
written
instructions
to
its
dealers,
to
its
salesmen,
in
which
they
keep
repeatedly
saying,
no
coercion.
the
dealer
is
free
to
select
what
he
wants.
but
despite
what
they
said,
despite
what
they
said,
it's
quite
apparent
that
it's
from
the
dealer's
point
of
view,
the
dealer
believed
that
he
was
required
to
buy
this
and
i
point
this
out
to
mr.
justice
brennan
in
answer
to
your
question
because
again,
if
there
would
be
modifications
of
the
sales
plan,
it
might
well
depend
on
precisely
how
the
modification
was
made.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
can't
recommend
as
they
--
in
the
way
which
they
recommend
it
here.
i
think
-
i
think
again
it's
just
a
matter
of
degree
i
suppose.
it
depends
on
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think
that
--
i
think
again
i
suppose
that
the
commission
would
have
to
--
the
commission
in
effect
has
done
that
here
saying
that
on
the
basis
of
what
they
have
done
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
we
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think
the
coercion
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think,
mr.
justice,
he
probably
needs
something
more
than
that
because
the
basis
on
which
the
commission's
decision
holding
the
atlantic
contract
to
be
invalid
rests
is
the
power
that
atlantic
has
and
the
fact
that
in
these
circumstances
that
the
power
is
brought
to
bear
and
i
think
we
need
something
probably
more
than
that
to
indicate
that
the
power
is
brought
to
bear
in
this
case
against
others
as
well.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
a
little
more
--
three
of
the
--
three
of
the
eight
operated
in
the
same
way
and
we
show
that
all
of
them
had
substantially
the
same
basic
contract.
thought
he
contra
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
we
--
the
156,
mr.
justice,
is
merely
the
number
of
oil
companies
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
sign
one
of
these
contracts,
goodyear
maybe
able
if
goodyear
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
we
don't
-
we
don't
know
again
if
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
they
could
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
know
nothing
about
their
power.
we
do
know
that
on
the
basis
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
to
the
existing
contract
--
as
to
the
existing
contract
but
as
to
the
others,
there
is
the
prohibition
on
entering
into
with
any
other
favor
again,
it
seems
that
this
is
the
kind
of
situation
where
if
goodyear
can
show
that
a
particular
contract
is
unlikely
to
have
this
vice,
ti
can
come
forward
and
demonstrate
this
to
commission.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
the
-
the
order
doesn't
prohibit
them
as
i
understand
it
from
really
initiating
discussions.
they
can
look
around
and
find
out.
and
again
as
i
say,
they
can
come
in
to
the
commission
to
seek
an
advisory
opinion
of
that
anytime
if
they
wanted
to
i
suppose.
