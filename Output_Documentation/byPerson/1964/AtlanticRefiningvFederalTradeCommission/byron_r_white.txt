justice
byron
r.
white
--
take
at
the
word
coercion
means
to
the
commission,
do
you
something
besides
whatever
it
flows
from
what
the
commission
called
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
both
of
these
they
recommend
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
make
no
money
at
this
present
system
really
i
mean
in
the
--
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
--
is
that
what
commission
found,
that
you
make
no
money
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
majors
that
the
use
the
purchase
resale?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
one
to
four.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
how
about
the
problem
with
distribution
of
the
small
tire
company?
apparently
one
of
the
real
practices
is
the
commission
system
is
if
we
do
have
good
service,
you
do
have
79
points,
distribution
points,
do
you
think
lee
would
have
79
distribution
points?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
know
of
any
small
tire
companies
so-called
small
rooms
would
cover
your
home
to
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
commission
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
wouldn't
goodyear
get
a
chunk
of
business
anyway
if
you
went
back
to
your
purchase
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you'd
make
a
requirement's
contract
with
them
sometime
or
(voice
overlap)
on
the
year's
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
would
go
out
through
their
own
stores.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
are
talking
about
purchase
and
resale
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
excuse
me,
is
that
--
is
that
contested
at
all
by
the
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
doesn't
mean
that
you
have
to
make
sure
they
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
might
require
to
do
but
does
it
require
you
to
undertake,
to
choose
the
brand
that
they
have
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
commission
deals
with
this
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
this
is
--
do
they
just
assume
that
you
do
have
to
do
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
assume
that
you're
going
to
do
it
one
way
or
another?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
don't
purport
to
forbid
you
from
doing
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
they
do
it
--
they
do
accept
from
legitimacy
if
you're
pursuing
carefully
and
insidiously
the
handling
of
the
specific
brand,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
who's
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nevertheless
this
is
one
of
the
underpinnings
of
the
commission's
opinion,
i
gather?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
power
alone
is
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
power
apparently,
you're
just
think
are
non-coercive.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
do
you
know
how
much
of
that
would
do
the
non-coercion
that
you
would
notice,
that
there
was
a
coercion
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
how
you
could
[inaudible]
how
could
you
order
-
what
basis
do
you
have
for
borrowing
the
use
of
non-coercive
--
non-coercive
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
he's
coerced.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
friedman,
i
had
still
a
little
trouble
what
--
understanding
whether
you're
arguing
that
that
some
of
these
remedy
is
justified
because
of
the
coercive
practices
in
this
case
or
whether
you're
really
saying
that
you
would
have
the
same
result
here
before
the
commission
absent
any
of
the
coercive
tactics
is
essentially
is
big
question.
some
of
these
instances
you
just
refer
to,
assuming
all
those
instances
were
out
of
the
case,
now
what
you
would
call
coercion.
i
would
think
you
would
--
that
the
commission
would
have
reached
the
same
case
from
the
government
-
same
result
on
the
government's
theory.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
used
their
best
efforts
to
convince
their
dealers
and
that
they
didn't
have
any
of
these
things
that
paragraphs
five
and
six
were
addressed
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
well
and
why
--
what
--
what
is
wrong
with
the
just
forgetting
coercion
and
then
just
having
an
order
that
-
that
enjoins
of
these
coercive
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
they
have
engaged
in
them,
because
that's
just
a
matter
of
remedy?
justice
byron
r.
white
an
inadequate
remedy.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
what
has
occurred?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that's
-
so
that's
your
theory
now
is
that
--
i
mean
if
that
is
the
--
that's
the
government's
position,
without
this
coercion
in
the
record,
no
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
but
don't
you
think
that
--
if
that's
your
--
if
that's
your
case,
don't
you
think
it
really
is
a
lot
different
than
the
theory
that
you
can't
get
out
of
the
commission's
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
what
page?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
know
on
this
--
you
don't
know
on
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah
but
they
certainly
go
on
here
and
they
have
the
power
even
without
the
whole
coercive
acts
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
they
have
to
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah
by
signing
the
commission
plan.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
through
the
use
of
the
sales
commission
plan,
all
they
have
to
do
is
sign
it
up
with
goodyear
and
there's
the
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
isn't
that
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
friedman,
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
the
company's
arguments
that
they
should
be
free
to
recommend
a
particular
line
of
tba.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
that
would
be
a
persuasive
argument
except
for
the
power
of
the
company.
that
that
is
the
real
nub
of
your
argument
i
gather
this
that
the
company
can't
recommend
and
at
the
same
time,
have
this
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
wouldn't
you
argue
that
is
it
is
the
contract
with
the
recommendation,
it's
the
contract
with
the
recommendation
has
done
here
that
that's
really
bad
why
shouldn't
-
why
shouldn't
the
commission
be
able
to
bar
them
entering
into
a
contract
by
which
the
company
promises
to
do
this.
promises
directly
and
then
promises
to
do
all
these
other
things
that
you
read
us.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
why
can't
you
just
order
goodyear,
bar
goodyear
from
entering
into
such
contracts
which
require
people
to
do
this
solely.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
any
regard
to
coercion
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
would
just
say
--
this
would
just
say
these
kinds
promises
in
the
contract
it
is
bad
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
-
and
you
think
that
satisfies
goodyear
by
saying
three
of
the
others
operated
in
that
same
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
156?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
understand
that.
goodyear
passes
--
the
goodyear
does
not
go
around
in
that
i
suppose
finding
on
one
of
these
contracts.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
all
those
fellows
with
the
power
in
the
sense?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
less
prevented
for
entering
into
the
contract
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
thing
about
their
power
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
thought
you
just
said
you
needed
that
element
in
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
having
permitted
and
get
around
without
filing
the
order,
giving
around
the
[inaudible]
156.
