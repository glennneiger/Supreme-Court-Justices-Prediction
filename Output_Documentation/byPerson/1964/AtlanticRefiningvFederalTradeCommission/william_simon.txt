mr.
william
simon
briefly
in
reply,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
an
expression
in
this
industry
which
i'm
sure
is
not
confined
the
brush
off
technique
in
dealing
with
the
salesman
and
what
you
were
describing
earlier
is
very
prevalent
in
this
industry.
statements
to
which
counsel
referred
where
it
would
be
a
supply
that
came
into
a
refilling
station
and
just
brushed
off
by
the
dealer
were
statements
incidentally
that
got
into
this
record
being
statements
by
a
would
be
a
supplier
of
what
dealer
told
them
and
they
were
admitted
not
for
the
truth
of
the
statements
but
as
showing
the
dealer's
state
of
mind.
they
were
not
admitted
for
the
truth
of
the
statement.
in
respect
to
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
goodyear
is
a
transgressor,
i
do
not
understand
counsel
to
dispute
what
i've
said
to
this
court.
the
uncontradicted
finding
in
this
case
is
that
goodyear
is
not
a
transgressor
and
has
not
participated
in
a
single
coercive
act.
the
reference
by
counsel,
the
one
with
mcmasters
and
some
very
unpleasant
meeting
at
somebody's
office
as
the
record
will
show
was
not
a
goodyear
office.
we
were
not
there.
in
respect
to
this
attempted
distinction
between
overt
and
covert
coercion,
i
don't
understand
it.
and
i
think
there's
only
one
kind
of
coercion
and
if
it's
overt,
it
relates
to
one
way
of
doing
it
and
if
it's
covert,
it
relates
to
another
way
of
doing
it.
it's
just
the
means
of
whether
they're
explicit
or
implicit.
that's
overt
and
covert
coercion
and
this
is
a
coercion
case.
i
think
it
emerges
from
counsel's
argument.
now
it's
equally
clear
from
counsel's
brief
that
that's
what
the
government's
position
before
this
court
really
is.
your
honors,
will
look
at
page
70
of
the
government's
brief,
you'll
find
at
the
bottom
of
page
70
a
statement
beginning
the
commission
properly
viewed
everything
that
atlantic
did
under
the
sales
commission
plan
as
a
single
interrelated
program,
say
these
were
the
steps
by
which
atlantic
satisfied
its
contractual
obligation
to
sponsor
and
promote
goodyear
products
and
for
all
which
goodyear
undertook
to
pay
it
a
substantial
commission.
these
steps
included
the
various
activities
described
at
length
in
the
statements
such
as
promotion
of
sponsored
tba,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
and
then
they
go
on
and
at
page
71
has
a
semicolon
and
then
they
say,
and
finally
threatening
dealers
who
refuse
to
purchase
goodyear
tba
with
cancellation
on
non-renewal
of
their
leases
on
contracts.
in
sum
it
says
the
government,
atlantic
marshaled
the
full
measure
of
its
economic
power
of
rich
dealers
to
carry
out
a
pressure
campaign
designed
to
get
them
to
handle
goodyear
and
firestone
products
and
because
of
the
extent
of
that
power
that
campaign
was
highly
successful.
i
think
if,
your
honors,
we'll
also
look
at
page
73
of
the
government's
brief,
you
find
the
statement
since
the
basic
vice
of
the
sales
commission
plan
is
atlantic's
exercise
of
its
economic
power
of
its
dealers
to
require
them
to
purchase
sponsored
tba.
that
theme
is
throughout
the
government's
brief.
i
think
it's
implicit
in
the
argument
which
counsel
was
made
and
with
that,
mr.
justice
white,
that
i
had
in
mind
what
i
said
that
in
substance
i
believe
government
before
this
court
confesses
error
in
respect
to
the
position
of
its
commission
and
the
court
of
appeals
relied
upon.
