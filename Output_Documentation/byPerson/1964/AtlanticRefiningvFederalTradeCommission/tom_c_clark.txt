justice
tom
c.
clark
i
suppose
in
most
cases,
atlantic
could
take
care
of
that
by
provisioning
or
leasing
through
or
rather
arrangement
with
the
dealer
saying
that
a
dealer
in
order
to
continue
this
arrangement,
you
must
have
an
adequate
supply
of
the
tires
and
batteries?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
the
--
as
i
read
the
commission
order,
it
doesn't
concern
itself
with
the
proposition
that
justice
goldberg
mentioned?
justice
tom
c.
clark
it
concerns
itself
was
pressure
by
atlantic
like
threats
to
cancel
or
renew
at
least
if
he
doesn't
take
a
particular
supplier's
product?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well
--
but
you
mentioned
just
five
and
six.
i'm
reading
in
paragraph
one
of
their
order.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well
i
have
the
commission
report
and
its
bound
volume;
number
one
is
inducing
or
attempting
to
induce
the
purchase
of
tba
products
of
a
particular
supplier
by
atlantic
dealers
by
threatening
to
cancel.
justice
tom
c.
clark
was
that
the
examiners?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well
thank
you
very
much.
that's
what
confused
me.
justice
tom
c.
clark
did
the
dealer
buy
--
he
pays
for
the
tire
to
pick
on
the
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
he
paid
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
have
no
money
at
all.
justice
tom
c.
clark
your
company
has
no
money
at
all.
you
just
trying
to
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
sale.
justice
tom
c.
clark
suppose
[inaudible]
eliminate
would
not
go
that
way.
who
would
fall
in
the
same
system
that
instead
of
a
dealer
thing,
the
tire
company
sent
two
of
them
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
instead
of
a
dealer
thing
to
charge.
they
sell
them
to
you
and
leverage
to
the
dealer
at
the
point
of
meeting
just
what
they
do
now
and
then
you
collected
from
your
dealer,
would
that
come
under
your?
justice
tom
c.
clark
mr.
ballard,
i
didn't
quite
read
the
commission's
report
that
way.
i
have
read
that
the
complaint
here
dealt
only
with
the
sales
commission
system
and
really
they
were
not
ruling
upon
the
validity
of
the
purchase
resale
method,
but
rather
that
was
not
what
was
involved
in
this
case
and
i
also
found
the
commission
to
support
on
big
report
and
this
--
and
referred
to
the
third
method
which
is
available
today
and
that
is
the
dealing
with
[inaudible]
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
being
in
wholesale
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
mr.
friedman,
why
would
they
have
to
do
that?
there's
an
order
that
authorizes
them
to
do
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
say
the
commission
could
merely
challenge
they're
going
back
in
face
of
the
commission
order
saying
that
it's
okay
for
them
to
do
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
in
-
but
in
terms
of
the
ordering
part
of
the
order,
the
enjoining
them
from
entering
into
a
contract,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
other
than
the
atlantic
refining
company.
wouldn't
that
--
wouldn't
that
imply
to
that
exception
here
and
that
if
they
bought
it
themselves
and
sold
it,
and
that
they'd
be
authorize
to
do
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
it's
not
a
new
method
of
distribution.
it's
a
well
known
method
of
distribution
in
the
industry.
the
record
shows
that
it
had
previously
been
engaged
in
by
this
particular
petitioner
and
the
commission
in
effect
is
saying
well
they
strike
down
this
method
and
isn't
the
inference
of
them
will
go
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
it's
alright
to
go
ahead
with
the
other
method?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i'm
not
talking
about
another
party.
i'm
talking
about
the
atlantic.
atlantic
was
before
the
commission.
in
fact
the
commission
counsel
asked
for
a
broader
order.
that
was
rejected
by
the
commission.
is
there
any
determination
by
the
commission
that
the
--
it's
alright
for
them
to
go
ahead?
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
theory
of
the
government's
theory
is
this
that
it
is
inherent
per
se
a
violation
putting
coercion
and
restraint
a
side,
it
is
a
per
se
of
violation
under
the
statute
for
a
company
on
this
side
to
enter
into
a
--
the
contract
of
this
kind,
the
commission
contract.
isn't
it
the
same
logic
that
is
applicable
to
a
purchase-resale
contract?
justice
tom
c.
clark
[inaudible]
what
i'm
reading
from
b37
of
the
appendix
which
is
the
part
where
they
mentioned
[inaudible]
now
do
i
read
this
wrong?
it's
in
reference
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
white
just
asked.
do
i
read
this
wrong?
i
thought
the
commission
would
merely
holding
that
in
effect
entering
into
a
sales
contract
with
a
major
oil
company
commission
contract
with
a
major
oil
company
is
a
per
se
violation.
now
if
we
look
at
b
37
isn't
that
where
it
says
that
it
is
where
but
could
i
say,
where
are
the
[inaudible]
of
the
record
contained
sample,
i
wouldn't
support
the
hearings
and
find
that
atlantic
has
coerced.
however
we
regard
this
overt
acts
as
the
mere
[inaudible]
to
be
more
fundamental
restraint
of
trade
inherent
in
the
sales
commission
system
itself.
isn't
this
-
and
isn't
the
fact
that
the
commission
maybe
properly
so
then
extended
this
order
to
all
dealers,
to
all
--
to
all
companies
with
whom
goodyear
does
business.
doesn't
that
indicate
regardless
of
whether
there
was
express
coercion
in
those
instances
and
again
i
refer
to
champlin
because
of
sale.
i
don't
know
if
it
adds
up,
but
isn't
that
therefore
the
finding
by
the
commission
that
this
type
of
agreement
is
in
inherent
anticompetitive
and
it's
such
a
character
that
it
maybe
outlawed
under
the
act.
justice
tom
c.
clark
as
symptomatic.
i
think
that
that's
quite
direct
you
have
evidence
of
this
case
and
the
evidence
ought
to
give
relied
upon,
ought
not
to
be
a
speculation.
i
take
it
that
commission
with
regarding
the
evidence
not
to
be
evidence
that
the
union
have
just
said
this
type
of
conduct
is
bad
because
the
commission's
order
that
extends
to
a
number
of
companies
where
we
don't
know
what
the
conduct
was
and
that
is
if
we
have
some
examples
which
i
take
means
that
as
commission
itself
said
that
these
are
mere
symptoms
of
the
inherent
vice
of
this
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
yes,
i
--
i
agree.
i
agree.
justice
tom
c.
clark
[inaudible]
to
fact
that
this
type
of
arrangement
by
reason
of
the
inherent
quality
of
pressure,
there
is
an
anticompetitive
arrangement
which
the
commission
may
properly
prevent.
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
i
find
no
objection
to
that
because
it's
better
that
the
case
be
proved
than
assumed.
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
i
think
that's
--
