mr.

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
necessary
for
him
representing
a
client
(inaudible)
is
this
necessary
for
us
to
overrule
the
allen
case
in
order
to
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
him
to
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sisk,
well,
(inaudible)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
everything
that
a
judge
might
say
do
he
not
that
he
might
(inaudible)
common
practice
before
you
come
in
(inaudible)
not
able
to
agree?
now,
the
(inaudible)
of
some
kind,
(inaudible)
the
fact
that
he
thinks
it
over
some
more,
is
that
be
--
would
that
be
wrong?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
long
before
they
ever
heard
of
allen,
that
that
practice
was
refuted
as
a
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
are
you
going
to
tell
us
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case
and
why
it
is
coercive
and
why
it
should
be
reversed
because
of
this
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
next
morning
this
is
a
type
(inaudible)
counsel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
counteract,
a
counteract
against
instruction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
heymann.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
what
did
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
--
i
wonder
if
i
had
mr.
heymann,
i
wish
you
would
address
yourself
to
it.
now,
in
the
charge
of
the
jury,
the
court
started
out
by
saying,
“ladies
and
gentlemen
in
the
jury,
what
we
have
here
is
a
very
simple
case
that
will
not
detain
new
law
and
it
--
in
which
you
should
have
no
difficulty
in
reaching
a
prompt
decision
one
way
or
the
other.
however,
they
should
do
in
addition
to
that.
he
reviewed
the
(inaudible)
and
told
how
these
witnesses
and
each
one
of
the
robberies
had
identified
this
man
and
there
was
just
this
simple
denial
that
he
committed
the
robbery
on
the
other
side.
and
then
he
also
summarized
the
evidence
to
--
by
saying
that
a
few
minutes
later
after
this
happened
after
the
robbery,
officer
demorrow
(ph)
of
the
police
department
testified
that
he
and
his
partner
and
a
couple
of
uniformed
men
responded
to
an
alarm
over
the
radio
and
they
planted
themselves
in
a
particular
point
in
these
across
the
street
and
observed
the
defendant
breathing
heavily,
acting
nervously
and
running
and
arrested
him.
they
took
him
to
the
store.
at
first
he
refused
to
get
out
of
the
car.
they
ordered
him
to
do
it.
they
took
him
into
the
store
and
the
officer
testified
that
mrs.
corrin
and
jewel
davis
(ph)
identified
the
defendant
as
a
man
who
just
entered
the
store.
now
in
view
of
that
array
of
witnesses
against
the
defendant,
its
simple
denial
of
the
fact
that
he
were
the
man
--
let's
start
the
case
--
the
instructions
offered
with
little
indications
that
he
is
guilty
when
it
says
what
we
have
here
is
a
very
simple
case.
that
should
not
detain
new
law
and
it
--
which
you
should
have
no
difficulty
in
reaching
a
conversation
one
way
or
the
other.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
just
seems
to
me
that
that
is
weighing
awfully
heavily
even
before
you
get
to
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
the
--
later
instruction
where
he
said
you
must
arrive
with
a
verdict
in
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they're
all
at
one
side
except
the
defendant
and
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
think
it
was
very,
very
strong
and
i
don't
say
that
judge
holtzoff
misstated
it
in
any
way,
saying
what
he
want.
when
i
say
when
as
--
as
a
full
misstatement
of
it,
its
only
the
plain
denial
of
the
defendant
and
he
then
says
"ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
grand
jury,
what
we
have
here
is
a
very
simple
case
that
should
not
detain
new
law."
which
you
would
seem
have
no
difficulty
of
reaching
a
verdict,
it
seems
to
me
that
he
thrown
his
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
heymann,
don't
you
think
(inaudible)
the
jury
said
that
they
were
unable
to
decide
the
case
because
of
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
the
judge
says,
"no,
i'm
not
going
to
accept
it.
you
have
got
to
reach
a
decision
for
this
case."
don't
you
think
it
would
be
unwise
for
us
to
let
that
stand
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
to
submit
the
case
among
the
jury
that
they
didn't
agree
and
they
thought,
didn't
we
have
to
put
(inaudible)
that
they're
insisting
that
a
--
and
the
jury
must
reach
a
decision
to
say,
"well,
we
just
--
if
you
don't
know,
you
just
have
to
submit
to
anybody
else,
to
somebody
else
and
that
wouldn't
be
sensible,
wouldn't
it?”
said
the
judge.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
but
we
--
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
jury
(inaudible)
on
this
language
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
if
(inaudible)
for
him
about
the
particular
time
to
object
what
the
judge
had
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
the
judge
says,
“you
have
to
reach
the
verdict
and
would
have
--
it
would've
been
wise
(inaudible)
as
a
trial
lawyer
to
stand
up
at
that
moment
and
object
to
it
in
front
of
the
jury.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
to
have
us
remedied
by
asking
the
judge
for
an
instruction
to
which
the
--
to
state
that
the
--
if
the
evidence
is
not
sufficient,
convince
him
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
they
should
--
he
would've
--
which
would've
accomplished
the
purpose
of
a
judgment
unlike
(inaudible)
the
judge
says,
"no,
i'm
not
gong
to
do
it."
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sisk.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sisk,
this
man
is

indigent,

always
appreciated
the
counsel
representing
the
indigent
defendants.

appreciate
your
(inaudible)
in
this
particular
case.
and
mr.
heymann,
