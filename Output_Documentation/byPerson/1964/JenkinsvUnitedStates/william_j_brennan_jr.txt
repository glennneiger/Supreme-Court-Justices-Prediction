justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
mr.
sisk,
(inaudible)
dispositive
or
did
you
ever
know
the
defendants
asked
for
an
allen
charge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
they
say
on
either
counts
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
jury
cannot
come
to
the
decision
on
both
counts
because
of
insufficient
evidence,
that's
fairly
ambiguous
don't
you
think?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
honor,
i
certainly
wish
he
would
have
given
that
instruction.
the
instruction
was
requested
as
we've
pulled
out
of
the
court
of
appeals
district
court
files.
i
don't
think
that
its
error
to
have
refused
to
give
one
--
to
refuse
to
repeat
one
small
part
of
what
took
the
greater
part
of
a
page
to
give
in
its
full
form.
in
other
words,
judges
don't
like
giving
--
judges
don't
like
repeating
a
small
part
of
an
instruction
which
requires
considerable
explanation.
the
full
instruction
on
burden
of
proof
was
given
the
first
time
at
page
44.
that's
only
two
hours
before
justice
goldberg
or
--
well,
two
hours
before
the
jury
returns.
you
see
it
takes
three
quarters
of
the
page
from
the
very
top
of
the
page
down
to
the
paragraph
for
getting
you
or
the
sole
judges.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
did
tell
them
didn't
he
that
they
could
find
him
guilty
and
one
on
the
--
not
guilty
on
the
other,(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
it
seems
to
me,
that's
the
import
of
the
petitioner
expressed
in
their
notes.
almost
(inaudible)
they
said
they
found
him
guilty
on
one
but
they
can't
find
him
guilty
into
the
constitution.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
he
stopped
and
said
that
over
again,
we
wouldn't
have
this
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you
mean
--
in
other
words
that
they
defy
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
when
they
got
--
have
the
--
how
do
you
instruct
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
had
finally
decided
then
that
the
jury
on
the
first
count
and
they
put
it
among
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
they
haven't
actually
taken
any
vote
in
instances
of
that
kind?
