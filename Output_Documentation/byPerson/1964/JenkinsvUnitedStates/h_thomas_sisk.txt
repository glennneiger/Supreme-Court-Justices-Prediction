mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
yes.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
criminal
case
that's
here
on
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
from
the
district
of
columbia.
this
case
concerns
one
instruction
if
any
a
trial
judge
should
give
a
jury
after
they
announced
that
they're
unable
to
reach
a
verdict.
petitioner's
main
contention
is
that
no
supplemental
instruction
whatsoever
should
be
given
which
encourages
juries
to
agree
after
they
have
once
retook
--
retired.
petitioner
basis
this
on
the
premise
that
each
individual
person
in
a
criminal
trial
has
a
constitutional
right
to
have
a
jury
disagree
and
that
a
supplemental
instruction
or
an
instruction
given
in
accordance
with
united
states
versus
allen
infringes
on
this
constitutional
right
as
its
very
purpose
is
to
facilitate
agreement
among
jurist.
it
applies
right
in
the
face
of
what
petitioner
contends
is
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
that's
exactly
it
your
honor.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
well,
there
is
two
points
on
certiorari
--
on
appeal
here,
your
honor.
the
first
point
is
that
allen
itself
is
unconstitutional
and
the
discharge
was
made
under
the
authority
of
the
allen
case.
and
the
second
point
is
that
the
charge
that
was
given
even
though
it
was
made
under
the
authority
of
the
allen
case
varied
so
far
from
the
allen
case
and
was
so
coercive
that
it
should
be
considered
reversed
below.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
well,
i
think
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
overrule
the
--
well,
let
me
rephrase
that,
your
honor.
i
think
it
would
desirable
to
overrule
allen
case.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
that's
my
personal
opinion.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
no
your
honor.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
no
--
to
answer
your
question
first,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
it's
necessary
to
overrule
allen
in
order
to
protect
my
client
and
obtain
a
reversal.
but
i
--
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
thank
you.
the
pertinent
facts
are
that
petitioner
was
charged
with
two
offenses,
one
of
robbery
and
one
of
assault
with
intent
to
commit
robbery.
the
jury
found
the
petitioner
guilty
of
robbing
a
local
high's
dairy
store
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
of
$38
and
not
guilty
of
the
offense
of
assault
with
intent
to
commit
robbery.
the
petitioner
was
sentenced
after
that
to
one
to
three
years
in
a
reformatory
and
he
is
presently
incarcerated
at
lorton
in
virginia.
now,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
evidence
when
the
jury
had
been
deliberating
for
approximately
two
hours,
the
juries
sent
a
note
to
the
trial
judge
which
i
would
like
to
read.
the
jury
cannot
come
to
a
decision
on
both
counts
because
of
insufficient
evidence.
that's
what
the
note
said
and
that's
found
on
page
48
of
the
record.
the
trial
judge
then
gave
a
supplemental
instruction
to
the
effect
that
the
jury
must
decide
the
case.
he
left
no
other
alternative.
and
the
instruction
that
the
judge
told
the
jury
and
i'll
quote
one
portion
of
it.
the
judge
said
to
jury,
"you
have
got
to
reach
the
decision
in
this
case.‚Äù
now
the
judge
emphasized
this
point
of
making
it
necessary
for
the
jury
to
reach
the
decision
at
least
three
or
four
times
in
an
instruction
that
is
not
over
a
page
long
in
the
record.
the
entire
supplemental
instruction
is
found
on
page
48
and
49
and
all
together,
it's
not
a
page
long
in
the
record.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
i
believe
this
was
at
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
your
honor,
i'm
sorry,
now
that
i
recollect,
it
was
around
four
o'clock
because
immediately
after
this
instruction,
the
judge
allowed
the
jury
to
retire
and
go
home
and
instructed
them
to
convene
the
next
morning.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
well
--
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
essentially
i
think
that's
it,
your
honor,
but
it
becomes
slightly
more
involved
for
this
reason.
the
government
argues
that
this
charge
was
not
made
under
the
authority
of
the
allen
case.
that's
their
main
contention,
they
go
on
and
their
brief
to
say
that
this
was
just
a
few
remarks
that
was
made
by
trial
judge
to
a
jury
which
happened
to
be
deadlocked.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
well,
your
honor,
i
think
i
have
to
disagree
with
you
and
respectfully
so.
the
magic
of
the
allen
charge
is
that
there
is
no
authority
whatsoever
with
supplemental
instructions
by
a
trial
judge
to
a
jury
that
has
disagreed
other
than
made
perhaps
on
the
evidence.
there's
no
authority
for
any
such
remarks
except
under
the
authority
of
the
allen
case.
now
we
stated
this
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
we
stated
this
in
our
brief.
and
the
government
has
not
--
point
it
to
one
single
case
nor
at
one
authority
whereby
they
can
say
--
to
say
that
there
is
some
proper
authority
for
a
trial
judge
to
make
remarks
to
a
jury
after
they
retire.
it
doesn't
concern
the
evidence.
they
haven't
point
it
to
one
thing
so
the
magic
of
the
allen
case
is
that
this
charge
necessarily
had
to
be
made
under
the
authority
of
the
allen
case.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
it
wouldn't
be
wrong
your
honor
but
if
it
was
said
--
it
would
have
to
be
said
under
the
authority
of
the
allen.
if
it
were
said
in
a
--
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
alright
well,
let
me
answer,
your
honor
this
way.
if
that
same
remark
was
said
by
a
judge
in
the
state
of
arizona,
then
it
would
be
reversed
for
error,
because
the
state
of
arizona
in
a
decision,
state
v.
thomas
which
is
as
--
was
set
forth
in
the
brief
has
said
that
no
supplemental
instruction
shall
be
allowed
by
a
trial
judge.
they
knocked
down
an
allen
type
charge,
a
charge
fashioned
exactly
after
allen
and
they
said
no
such
charges
will
be
tolerated
in
the
state
again.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
well,
since
it
was
a
judge
made
law,
i
suppose
the
court
of
arizona
felt
--
i
don't
suppose
i
know
exactly
why
they
knocked
it
down.
the
state
of
arizona
knocked
the
allen
type
charge
down
because
they
found
that
it
did
two
things.
first
of
all,
it
violated
an
individual's
basic
right
to
a
fair
trial
and
secondly,
it
was
impossible
to
administer
fairly.
each
court
of
appeals,
each
change
in
personnel
in
the
arizona
supreme
court
put
different
interpretations
on
the
allen
charge.
they
didn't
know
how
far
to
allow
the
trial
judges
to
stray
from
the
exact
words
of
the
allen
charge.
they
didn't
--
they
couldn't
agree
as
to
when
the
allen
charge
should
be
given
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
and
for
those
reasons,
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
completely
did
a
way
with
the
allen
charge.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
yes,
your
honor.
that
was
the
second
point
that
i
was
going
to
get
to,
but
i
think
i
might
as
well
take
that
right
now.
the
supplemental
charge
it
was
given,
these
are
the
salient
portions
of
the
charge
and
this
was
the
trial
judge
speaking
to
the
jury.
now,
i'm
not
going
to
accept
this.
you've
got
to
reach
a
decision
in
this
case.
you've
got
to
weigh
the
evidence
and
reach
a
conclusion.
this
case
has
to
be
decided.
and
then
he
went
on
and
said
to
the
jurist
that
they
had
all
the
evidence
that
anyone
could
have
but
the
purpose
of
jurors
was
to
decide
cases
and
they
wouldn't
be
needed
if
there
were
no
problems,
that
it
was
a
simple
case,
that
the
jurors
had
decided
much
harder
cases,
that
if
it
were
open
and
shut,
the
courts
would
need
juries,
and
if
they
were
excused,
some
other
jury
would
have
to
decide
it
on
the
same
evidence
which
would
not
be
very
sensible.
first
of
all
--
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
two
hours,
your
honor.
perhaps
a
couple
of
minutes
but
as
to
my
recollection
it
was
almost
exactly
two
hours.
now,
the
petitioner
maintains
that
this
wasn't
just
a
dis
--
a
digression
from
the
allen
case
but
it
was
almost
exactly
contrary
to
the
allen
case
in
which
--
i'm
sure
the
court
will
remember,
in
which
it
was
held
that
the
jury
had
to
be
reminded
that
they
should
only
reach
a
decision
that
they
conscientiously
do
so
in
the
charge
before
the
court
of
course,
there
was
no
such
moderating
reminder
as
they
given
whatsoever.
secondly,
it
was
coercive
because
it
ridiculed
the
jury
members
and
it
implied
that
if
they
had
good
intelligence
or
good
sense,
they
wouldn't
have
any
trouble
getting
together
in
the
case
--
in
the
suit
or
--
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
no,
your
honor.
he
didn't
suggest
that
at
all.
as
i
said
he
ridiculed
the
jury
by
suggesting
that
if
they
had
good
sense
they
should
be
able
to
get
together.
now,
i'd
like
to
refer
to
powell
v.
united
states
which
is
a
fifth
circuit
case.
and
there
the
jury
was
told
that
they
shouldn't
stand
out
and
--
or
they
shouldn't
hold
out
in
a
spirit
of
pure
stubbornness
because
they
ought
to
reach
a
--
ought
to
be
able
to
reach
a
decision
because
they
were
as
competent
as
any
other
jury.
and
in
the
fifth
circuit,
that
case
was
reversed
because
it
said
that
no
jury
should
be
induced
to
agree
to
a
verdict
by
fear
that
a
failure
to
do
so
with
reflect
upon
his
intelligence
and
that's
the
exact
case
here.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
now
your
honor
mentioned
--
mr.
justice
white
mentioned
a
moment
ago
that
the
judge
didn't
make
any
mention
as
to
which
way
they
should
decide
this
case.
but
i
don't
think
it's
any
question
for
what
the
allen
charge
is
a
government
weapon.
i
don't
think
if
any
question
and
i
think
all
prosecutors
will
agree
to
this
that
the
allen
charge
favors
the
government.
the
government
wins
the
vast
percentage
of
cases
that
they
try
and
it
stands
to
reason
that
if
this
is
brought
out
to
its
logical
conclusion
on
(inaudible)
--
majority
of
jury
members
are
in
favor
of
conviction
and
when
a
--
when
they
are
told
that
they
should
give
weight
to
what
the
majority
says,
it
--
the
petitioner's
way
of
thinking
and
to
my
way
of
thinking,
it's
nothing
more
than
suggesting
that
they
should
reach
a
verdict
of
guilty
or
at
least
the
majority
verdict
instead
of
the
unanimous
verdict.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
only
from
my
own
experience,
your
honor,
from
my
six
--
being
a
prosecutor
for
approximately
six
years.
and
i
know
that
as
the
prosecutor
when
the
allen
charge
was
given,
i
was
very
happy
because
it
was
more
than
one
count.
i
could
figure
on
one
--
in
one
of
them
anyway.
i'd
like
to
further
say
that
the
--
that
a
number
of
cases
have
not
even
found
the
allen
charge
necessary.
and
i
refer
this
and
all
of
these
cases
that
have
--
decided
at
this
point
or
found
in
the
brief,
but
i
just
like
to
run
down
the
list
of
them.
first
of
all,
there
is
--
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
never,
your
honor,
never.
and
in
the
few
years
that
i
have
not
been
a
prosecutor,
i've
never
asked
for
that
type
of
charge
for
the
defendant.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
i
didn't
try
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
there
was
no
objection
made
to
it,
no
objection
at
all.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
well,
the
next
morning,
the
trial
counsel
--
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
yes,
the
trial
counsel
was
a
man
who
had
been
appointed
to
this
case
in
legal
aid
and
i
think
did
an
excellent
job
but
he
was
limited
and
experienced.
and
in
the
next
day,
he
did
as
the
instruct
--
the
court
upon
instruction
not
against
the
allen
charge
but
an
instruction
on
what
reasonable
doubt
is
because
he
felt
that
the
(inaudible)
--
the
note
that
the
jury
had
returned
would
call
for
an
instruction
or
reasonable
doubt.
that
was
denied
and
the
instruction
that
was
given
was
here.
but
to
go
on,
your
honor
asked
for,
is
it
necessary
to
reverse
allen
in
order
to
protect
my
client.
and
i
said
no,
because
i
said
that
i
felt
that
the
charge
that
was
given
was
so
coercive,
it
couldn't
be
found
in
conformity
with
allen.
but
i
also
say
this
and
this
was
why
allan
was
raised
your
honor,
that
this
--
allen
violated
his
constitutional
rights.
he
had
a
right
to
have
a
jury
disagree,
that's
his
main
point.
and
any
infringement
on
that
right,
no
matter
how
slight
in
the
way
of
an
allen
charge
was
a
violation
of
his
constitutional
right
and
it's
simply
shouldn't
(inaudible),
and
that's
why
the
allan
charge
came
into
play
here.
i
would
like
to
make
one
more
point
before
sitting
down.
there
is
a
very
interesting
decision
that's
not
in
my
brief,
that's
from
the
fifth
circuit.
it's
entitled,
walker
versus
united
states.
it
was
decided
february
25th,
1965
and
it's
appellate
number
21480.
now
in
that
decision
--
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
the
fifth
circuit,
your
honor.
in
that
decision,
the
conviction
was
upheld
even
though
a
complaint
was
made
that
an
allen
charge
was
given.
and
just
to
show
you
how
far
an
allen
charge
can
diverge,
this
is
what
they
considered
to
be
an
allen
charge
in
the
fifth
circuit.
i
do
want
to
state
to
the
members
of
the
jury
that
is
--
that
it
is
important
that
a
jury
reached
a
verdict
if
possible.
the
jury
room
is
no
place
for
pride
of
opinion.
it
is
a
place
for
an
exchange
of
views.
that's
all
that
was
said
and
objection
was
made
to
that.
and
on
appeal,
the
conviction
was
sustained.
but
there
was
a
dissenting
opinion
by
judge
brown
of
the
fifth
circuit,
who
have
relied
on
quietly
heavily
in
the
brief
and
he
points
out
that
it
was
a
judge
made
rule
and
i
would
like
to
quote
from
him
if
--
ought
to
be
the
judges
who
put
an
end
to
it
in
a
quick
and
not
too
decent
(inaudible).
then
he
goes
on
to
point
out
that
--
a
committee
report
was
given
at
the
50th
annual
meeting
of
the
american
judicature
society
which
was
held
august
14,
1963.
the
committee
chairman
at
the
conclusion
of
the
report
stated
this,
‚Äúnor
do
we
circulate
the
allen
charge
to
the
new
judges
as
i
use
to
do
when
heading
up
the
criminal
division
in
the
department
of
justice.
allen
is
dead
and
we
do
not
believe
in
dead
law.‚Äù
thank
you.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
just
a
few
words,
your
honor.
first
i'd
like
to
say
that
every
jury
panel
on
the
district
of
columbia
that
every
panel
of
prospective
jury
members,
i
guess
i
should
say
are
given
detailed
instructions
before
they
ever
walk
into
the
courtroom
as
to
what
the
duties
of
the
juror
are.
i
don't
know
whether
the
district
of
columbia
is
unique
in
this
respect
but
i
do
know
that
they're
all
given
detailed
instruction
as
to
what
their
duties
are.
so
i
think
--
i
find
it
rather
difficult
to
believe
that
these
jury
members
simply
decided
not
to
vote
because
they
didn't
like
the
way
the
trial
had
been
conducted.
i
think
they
had
something
else
on
their
mind
and
it
seems
that
rather
incredible
to
me
that
they
would
completely
disregard
all
of
the
instructions
that
they've
been
previously
given
and
just
sat
in
there
and
decided,
"well,
we
don't
think
we're
even
going
to
vote
on
this
case
because
they
simply
haven't
done
a
good
enough
job
either
the
defense
or
the
government."
but
the
main
thing
that
concerns
me
is
that
the
government
has
assumed
that
a
trial
judge
just
has
a
right
to
make
remarks
to
the
jury
after
they
re
--
after
they
retire.
i
don't
know
why
they
have
assumed
this
but
this
is
the
whole
picture
of
the
argument
that
a
trial
judge
does
have
a
right
to
make
this
remarks
just
they
point
to
no
authority
whatsoever,
no
authority.
we
have
been
able
to
find
no
authority
other
than
count
--
other
than
the
allen
case
and
that's
why
we
continue
to
say
that
what
was
said
in
this
case
was
set
under
the
authority
of
the
allen
case
and
if
every
individual
does
have
a
right
to
have
a
jury
disagree
and
that's
what
we
contend
in
this
case.
that
every
individual
has
that
right
then
no
matter
how
slight
the
intrusion
is,
no
matter
how
careful
the
trial
judge
is
when
he
intrudes
upon
that
right
upon
making
any
suggestion
whatsoever
that
they
should
agree.
well,
then
he's
violated
the
constitutional
right
and
it
shouldn't
be
allowed.
also
one
other
thing
i
think
would
help
to
put
this
case
on
a
better
light.
mr.
heymann
said
that
he
saw
no
reason
why
the
government
attorney
didn't
object.
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
why
he
didn't
stand
up
and
be
heard
at
the
proper
time.
and
because
of
this,
it
might
have
been
some
tactical
movement
on
his
part.
there
is
a
stipulation
between
the
government
and
the
petitioner
which
would
permit
the
court
to
read
the
entire
transcript
and
as
mr.
heymann
says
at
the
very
short
transcript.
and
i
would
suggest
that
if
the
court
could
look
at
the
entire
transcript,
well
they
would
have
a
better
understanding
as
to
why
the
government,
as
to
why
the
defense
attorney
didn't
do
anymore
than
he
did.
he
was
interrupted
practically
on
every
page
of
the
transcript
without
cause.
not
once
but
usually
twice
on
every
page
of
the
transcript.
i'd
like
to
say
that
he
was
accused
of
--
he
was
accused
of
offensing
with
the
witnesses,
all
of
these
in
open
court
before
the
jury.
he
was
accused
offensing
with
the
witnesses
failing
to
cooperate,
not
being
interested
in
the
truth,
dealing
with
the
witnesses
not
at
arm's
length,
being
cagey,
told
to
be
frank,
stop
backing
--
told
to
be
open
and
above
board
and
stop
acting
like
a
poker
player.
stop
holding
his
cards
so
close
to
his
chest,
stop
considering
the
trial
a
game.
stop
trying
to
trap
the
witnesses
and
endeavor
to
be
more
interested
in
justice.
now
i
think
that
that
puts
it
in
a
proper
light.
perhaps
that's
why
he
didn't
say
anything
more
than
what
he
did.
thank
you.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
yes
sir.

printed
record,
your

mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
i
think
--
i'm
guessing
now,
your
honor,
but
i'm
almost
certain
that's
on
--
well,
i
think
it
was
approximately
page
40
or
39
or
something
such
as
that.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
yes,
your

mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
without
--
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
--
his
help
--
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
--
i
wouldn't
be
able
to
do
this
at
all.
mr.
h.
thomas
sisk
thank
you,
your
