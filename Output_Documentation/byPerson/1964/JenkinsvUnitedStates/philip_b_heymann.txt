mr.
philip
b.
heymann
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
begin
by
saying
that,
of
course,
our
contention
is
that
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
allen
charge.
if
it
has
to
be
sustained
then
to
the
allen
charge,
we
should
lose
but
all
you
have
to
--
is
look
at
the
two
pages,
they're
totally
different.
but
i
also
think
the
chief
justice's
question
led
in
the
right
direction.
of
course,
the
charge
doesn't
have
to
be
sustained
under
the
allen
case.
judges
make
the
law
as
to
what
it
said
when
a
jury
returns
and
the
question
is,
what's
proper
law?
what
was
said
here
was
not
the
allen
charge.
arizona
didn't
deny
--
even
arizona
didn't
deny
all
supplemental
instructions.
i
think
mr.
sisk
was
wrong
about
that.
they
--
arizona
did
say
that
the
(inaudible)
--
that
the
allen
charge,
well,
in
its
view
technically
correct
was
more
trouble
than
was
worth
and
said
that
their
lower
court
should
no
longer
use
it.
finally,
i'd
like
to
begin
by
saying
that
justice
stewart
did
characterize
our
position
correctly
as
saying
that
coercion
is
of
course
bad.
and
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
there
is
coercion.
that's
an
issue
that
has
to
be
resolved.
nevertheless,
it
does
seem
mr.
sisk
does
return
to
the
allen
charge
and
he
returns
to
what
the
proper
standards
here
are.
and
i
would
like
it
introduce
my
argument
by
talking
for
a
moment
about
the
standards
which
seemed
to
us
to
be
rather
clear.
we
of
course
agree
that
a
jury
has
no
duty
to
decide
a
case
if
that
means
that
it
has
to
reach
a
verdict
even
though
there
remains
conscientious
difference
of
view
after
all
avenues
of
rational
persuasion
have
been
exhausted.
they
don't
have
to
flip
a
coin,
they
don't
have
to
fight,
they
don't
have
to
compromise,
and
they
don't
have
to
vote
with
the
majority.
on
the
other
hand,
the
jury
does
have
a
duty
to
exhaust
all
avenues,
all
reasonable
avenues
of
rational
persuasions
and
explore
the
areas
of
their
differences.
it's
the
way
the
jury
systems
always
been,
it's
the
common
law
system.
they
don't
vote
individually.
they're
putting
the
room
together
and
expected
to
discuss
the
case.
in
line
of
this,
it's
fairly
easy
to
say
with
generality
where
the
judge
should
or
should
not
say
when
a
jury
returns
after
a
period
of
time
which
he
believes
is
inadequate
for
them
to
have
explored
the
issues
and
see
what
their
areas
of
disagreement
are,
he
should
say
to
them
that
he
wants
him
to
go
back
longer,
discuss
further,
remain
open
minded,
don't
be
stubborn,
try
to
persuade
the
subject
that
need
persuasion
through
persuasion.
don't
give
up
your
conscientious
views.
that's
what
the
jury
system
is
about.
now
all
the
allen
cases
that
have
been
cited
in
the
brief
involved
four
possible
errors
that
can
emerge
out
of
the
charge.
three
things
a
judge
shouldn't
say
as
justice
white
indicated,
he
shouldn't
indicate
what
view
of
the
--
what
verdict
he
thinks
would
be
proper
in
the
case.
incidentally
in
this
case
there
is
no
--
there's
no
basis
for
i
believe
that
judge
holtzoff
indicated
that.
the
judge
shouldn't
say
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
incidentally
in
this
case
judge
holtzoff
did
not
indicate
that
i
don't
believe
what
you
--
he
thought,
what
verdict
he
thought
would
be
proper.
the
judge
should
certainly
not
tell
the
jury
what
he
thinks
would
be
proper
in
a
way
of
a
verdict.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
mr.
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
supplemental
charge
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
mr.
chief
justice,
i
assumed
or
have
no
way
of
knowing
that
judge
holtzoff
meant
when
he
said
this
is
a
simple
case
that
it
has
very
few
witnesses.
there
are
about
three
witnesses
on
each
count.
the
entire
original
trip
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
the
defendant
called
one
of
their
witnesses
just
simply
to
show
that
he
couldn't
identify
the
defendant.
he
called
philip
corn,
the
whole
case
reading
the
original
transcript
downstairs
only
takes
about
45
minutes.
that's
some
indication.
i
do
think
as
you
read
over
judge
holtzoff's
description
of
the
evidence
that
the
--
that
you
get
the
impression
that
the
defendant
is
guilty
but
that
may
be
the
way
the
evidence
came
in
too
mr.
chief
justice.
it
may
not
be
an
unfair
summary
by
judge
holtzoff
of
what
came
in,
it
may
be
that
the
evidence
was
fairly
--
was
strong
in
this
case
that
the
defendant
was
guilty.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
alright,
you're
saying
that
in
a
very
--
that
in
the
case
it's
very
strong
for
the
government,
the
judge
perhaps
should
not
say
that
it's
a
simple
case
and
perhaps
that's
right.
i
--
we've
concentrated
the
only
attack
in
this
court,
the
only
attack
in
this
court
has
been
on
the
supplemental
instruction
and
we've
concentrated
our
attention
on
that.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
yes,
mr.
justice
goldberg
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well,
until
you
said
the
last
sentence,
justice
goldberg,
i
was
going
to
be
--
i
was
going
to
say
i
couldn't
be
more
delighted
that
you
asked
that
question.
how
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well,
let
me
work
up
to
it
and
enjoy
the
first
steps.
a
judge
has
certain
obligations
when
the
jury
comes
in
and
says
the
jury
is
divided.
a
jury
can
come
in,
of
course,
and
say
something
else.
it
can
say
we
were
sitting
around
the
conference
table
in
the
jury
room.
we
were
talking
and
we
all
agreed
that
we
shouldn't
or
can't.
now,
it
could
say
either
one
of
those
two
things
beside
this
case
because
it's
just
a
lousy
record.
not
enough
evidence
have
been
put
in.
there's
no
way
to
run
a
(inaudible).
the
jury
says
that
what
the
judge
should
say
to
them
is
you
have
to
decide
this
case,
individually
not
as
a
jury,
and
i
should
have
added
that.
individually
each
one
of
you
has
to
vote
in
this
case.
there's
no
such
thing
as
being
unwilling
to
vote.
now
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
they
did
say
--
they
said
the
jury
cannot
decide
the
case
on
either
count
because
of
insufficient
evidence.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
alright.
yes,
your
honor,
i
agree.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
they
said
on
both
counts
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
oh,
it
should
be
--
couldn't
be
more
ambiguous.
there
was
an
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
whether
they
met
either
of
both
but
that
couldn't
be
more
ambiguous.
but
returning
to
insufficient
evidence,
i
read
judge
holtzoff's
charge
and
i
will
get
back
to
whether
he
shouldn't
have
recharged
on
the
burden
of
proof.
i
read
judge
holtzoff's
charge
on
48
and
49
as
taken
--
taking
the
question
as
justice
goldberg
took
it
as
directed
to
insufficient
evidence.
he
says,
“well
you
have
all
the
evidence
there
is,
all
the
evidence
that
anybody
can
have”.
in
other
words
the
jury
has
no
business
asking
for
more
evidence
and
they
don't
have
any
business
asking
for
more
evidence.
that's
what
we
have
jurors
for
to
decide
on
the
evidence.
if
there
weren't
any
problems,
we
wouldn't
have
a
jury.
now
i'm
not
going
to
accept
this.
you
got
to
reach
a
decision
in
this
case.
of
course,
every
case
involves
a
problem.
he
goes
on
and
on.
he
tells
them
to
go
home
and
sleep
on
it.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
think
he
--
i'm
--
i
seem
to
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well
the
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
the
top
of
page
43,
justice
brennan
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
the
top
of
page
43
of
the
record,
you
will
bring
in
a
separate
verdict
on
each
of
the
2
counts.
and
in
each
instance,
your
verdict
should
be
either
guilty
or
not
guilty.
he
didn't
tell
them
that.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well,
perhaps
not,
perhaps
not.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
at
this
point
to
return
to
the
aspect
of
the
case
that
assumes
that
the
jury
would
--
that
the
judge
had
a
divided
jury
or
to
justice
goldberg.
i
personally
read
this
charge
as
if
the
jury
came
back
and
said,
“we
don't
want
to
decide
this
case.
we
don't
want
to
vote
for
acquittal
and
we
don't
want
to
vote
for
conviction
because
there's
insufficient
evidence.”
and
the
judge
said
to
them,
"you
have
to
decide
it.”
that's
the
way
i
read
those
words.
now,
i
wish
you
would
have
given
--
i
wish
he
would've
repeated
the
instruction.
i
think
the
trial
judge
has
the
discretion
to
refuse
to
repeat
one-fifth
or
one-seventh
of
the
--
of
a
complete
instruction.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
if
i
would
--
what
the
reaction
of
jury
was
on
this
particular
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well,
your
honor,
if
the
question
is
whether
the
charge
was
coercive
in
the
sense
that
telling
the
jury
they
should
compromise,
flip
coins,
vote
with
the
majority.
i
feel
very
convinced
that
it
should
be
resolved
and
if
there's
--
and
if
it's
doubtful
whether
it
was
coercive
and
let
me
point
out
that
in
this
case,
the
jury
came
back
the
following
morning
deliberated
for
four
hours,
the
long
time
for
a
45-minute
record.
they
asked
for
testimony.
there's
doubt
after
that.
i
think
it
should
be
resolved
under
rule
30
and
rule
52
or
54.
every
purpose
of
the
requirement
of
an
objection
to
instruction
and
a
requirement
of
plain
error
is
here
in
this
phase.
we
can't
tell
what
tone
judge
holtzoff
used
or
what
the
atmosphere
in
the
courtroom
was.
defendant's
counsel
could
have
told.
defendant's
counsel,
for
all
we
know,
didn't
find
anything
coercive,
didn't
object
one
purpose
of
rule
30.
another
purpose
is
to
allow
the
judge
to
correct
the
charge.
he
could
easily
have
corrected
any
suggestion
that
the
jury
was
supposed
to
compromise.
he
had
to
add
only
a
sentence.
of
course,
no
one
should
give
up
a
conscientious
objection,
the
major
purpose
of
rule
30.
finally,
there's
a
real
possibility,
a
very
real
possibility
of
a
tactical
decision
by
defense
counsel
here.
the
jury
had
come
back
and
said
the
evidence
is
insufficient.
they
didn't
like
the
state
of
the
evidence.
we
have
no
reason
to
think,
although
defendants
don't
generally
ask
for
allen
charges
that
this
defendant
wasn't
delighted
to
have
a
charge
that
would
leave
the
jury
to
decide
the
case.
he
had
no
reason
to
think
that
this
wasn't
a
calculated
decision
that
he
was
delighted
with.
all
these
reasons,
every
reason
that
could
possibly
come
up
in
rule
30
in
the
plain
error
rule
whether
it's
52
or
54
is
present
here.
now,
the
--
its
--
they're
frequently
present
in
supplemental
instructions
to
juries
and
the
courts
have
regularly
relied
on
that
and
i
think
quite
property.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
this
was
the
legal
aid
counsel
in
the
trial
court
and
the
separate
counsel
again
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
separate
counsel
here.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
take
it
legal
aid
counsel
is
appointed.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
we're
hung
on
one
count
which
--
would
you
give
me
once
more,
justice
white,
i
was
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
that's
what
they
say.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well,
let
me
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well,
let
me
refine
it
a
little,
i'm
not
sure
where
it
leads,
justice
white.
when
they
go
back,
they
ask
for
evidence
on
count
one.
that's
the
count
on
which
they
find
him
guilty.
so
if
they're
saying,
“we
can't
agree
on
both
counts.
we're
hung
on
one
count.”
they
must
have
agreed
that
he
was
innocent
at
count
two
and
be
hung
on
count
one.
that's
the
count.
they
go
back
and
they
think
about
for
four
hours,
have
the
testimony
read
to
them.
is
that
--
now
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
they've
decided
if
this
construction
--
i
personally
in
reading
the
record
and
reading
the
fairly
--
each
count
has
a
certain
number
if
eyewitnesses,
etcetera.
i
would
think
that
the
best
way
of
reading
both
was
as
to
the
grammatical
error.
i
don't
mean
to
be
begging
the
question.
they
say
we
can't
agree
on
both
counts.
i
would
think
that
the
more
likely
the
thing
they
meant
was
that
we
can't
agree
to
decide
this
case.
there
are
2
counts.
that's
right.
on
both
counts,
we
find
themselves
unable
to
deicide,
they
didn't
say
3.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
don't
--
i
don't
mean
that
--
i
said
agree
justice
brennan.
i
don't
mean
if
they're
divided.
what
they
said
was
we
cannot
decide,
we
cannot
reach
a
decision
on
both
counts
because
of
insufficient
evidence.
i
think
justice
goldberg
is
right
in
suggesting
that
they
weren't
really
saying
they
were
divided.
they
were
saying
they
were
dissatisfied
with
the
state
of
the
record.
now
that's
one
question.
another
question
is
what
do
they
mean
on
both
counts?
i
think
they
meant
they
were
dissatisfied
with
the
state
of
the
record
on
both
counts,
not
that
there
was
one
count
on
which
they
were
satisfied
with
the
state
of
the
record
and
another
one
on
which
they
were
not.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
this
is
yes.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
they
acquitted
him
on
the
fact
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
or
if
they--
if
they
--
perhaps
they
had
taken
it
--
perhaps
they
had
taken
it
both
and
gone
back
and
agreed
that
this
was
still
a
hell
of
the
way
to
run
a
railroad.
they
just
didn't
like
it.
it's
hard
--
this
is
way
often
the
realm
of
speculation
as
to
what
a
jury
was
doing.
i
don't
want
to
deny
that.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well,
your
honor,
you
are
faced
with
the
fact
that
it
--
that
after
--
first
of
all
that
he
may
have
been
responding
in
light
of
what
justice
goldberg
said
that
they
were
saying,
“individually,
we
don't
want
to
vote
in
this
case”.
and
at
that
point
it's
quite
correct
to
say,
“you've
got
to
vote
individually.”
he
may
have
been
responding
on
that
basis.
second
of
all,
they
did
go
out
for
four
hours
on
a
case.
it's
surprising
that
they
weren't
resolved
after
the
first
two
hours
when
they
came
in
and
asked
the
question
and
they
went
out
for
twice
again
that
much,
a
total
of
six
hours
on
a
short
case.
i
have
a
hard
time
finding
coercion.
i
would
be
inclined
to
say
it
was
harmless
error.
if
there
were
an
objection,
i
find
it
very
hard
to
say
if
there's
plain
error
with
no
objection.
now,
i
have
nothing
further
to
say,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
mr.
chief
justice,
it
depends
on
what

and
that

and
it
could
be
taken
the
way
you
suggest
and
it
could
be
taken
innocently.
and
in
that

i

not

plain

--
we
have
no
indication
that
defense
counsel
who
had
every

if
he

if
he
wanted
to

he
had
every

mr.

the

he

to
come

mr.

mr.

the
instruction
he

the

there

there
were
six
people

11
who
said,
“guilty

unreasonable
doubt”
and
a
certain
number
who
said
not.
repeating
the
instruction
on

would
not
have
accomplished
the
purpose
of
eliminating
whatever
coercion
there
was
in
the
trial

to

towards
telling
them
that
they
had

the
only
thing
it
did
was
tell
him
how
to
arrive
at
a
decision
if
they
were
in

how
to
arrive.
it
didn't
eliminate
the
coercion
that
would
suggest
that
they
should
flip
a
coin

vote
with
the

or
give
up
conscientious
beliefs.
