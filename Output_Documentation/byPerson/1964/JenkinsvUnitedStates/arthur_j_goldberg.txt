justice
arthur

goldberg
--
the
chief
justice
said,
do
you
see
a
difference
when
a
jury
comes
in
and
says,
“your
honor,
we
cannot
agree
on
the
evidence
which
is
the
passive
quote.”
but
here
the
jury
didn't
say
that.
the
jury
said,
"the
jury
cannot
come
to
the
decision
on
both
counts
because
of
insufficient
evidence.”
(inaudible)
isn't
that
tell
you
to
a
verdict
of
acquittal?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
about
the
last
sentence?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
that
isn't
what
they
said.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
what
is
the
meaning
of
that?
they
haven't
said
we're
divided.
they
came
in
and
they
said
to
the
court,
“we
can't
agree
to
the
decision
in
this
case.”
they
didn't
say
we're
differing
about
this,
this
just
because
of
insufficient
evidence.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
we
think
proper
instructions
of
the
--
by
the
judge
if
there
had
to
be
a
supplemental
instruction,
mr.
heymann
to
be
that
under
the
instructions
i
have
given
you
and
the
government
must
prove
their
case
beyond
unreasonable
doubt,
if
the
evidence
is
insufficient,
your
--
turn
me
a
verdict
of
not
guilty.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
if
there's
doubt
about
what
do
we
--
the
reaction
with
the
jury
was,
how
should
that
doubt
be
resolved?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
mean,
what
you
were
saying,
if
the
judge
was
not
clear
in
what
are
you
saying
to
the
jury,
from
a
criminal
trial
in
response
to
a
question
like
this.
how
should
the
doubt
be
resolved
up
here?
