justice
potter
stewart
you
told
us
that
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
they
must
reach
a
verdict
for
that
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
i
read
the
government's
brief
they
entirely
agree
with
you
that
the
judge's
statement
having
--
and
i'm
reading
now
have
the
coercive
effect
you
attribute
to
it.
the
judgment
should
be
reversed
and
remanded
for
a
new
trial.
so
really
what
would
come
down
to
agreeing
those
instructions
in
saying
that
they're
not
--
will
be
the
view
as
the
interpretation
you've
given,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
as
far
as
the
parties
are
concerned
at
least?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what's
so
--
what's
the
magic
about
the
allen
case
about
those
who
had
to
questions
this
case
i
gather
is
whether
or
not
the
instructions
can
be
fairly
read
as
telling
the
jury
that
they
--
as
coercive
instructions.
justice
potter
stewart
these
words
are
not
identical
with
the
allen
word.
there's
nothing
magic
about
the
allen
case,
the
allan
charge.
this
was
a
different
charge
and
the
question
before
us
here
is
whether
or
not,
these
words
were
coercive.
and
if
they
were
the
government
agreed
with
you
to
the
cause
of
that
judgment
ought
to
be
reversed.
justice
potter
stewart
in
those
exact
words
--
if
you're
right
about
that
then
this
judgment
also
should
be
reversed
because
clearly
and
concededly
these
are
not
the
same
words
as
the
allen
charge.
justice
potter
stewart
understand
that
to
be
