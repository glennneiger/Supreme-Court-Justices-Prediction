mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes,
sir.
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
argument
of
the
state
of
california
this
morning
will
be
divided
into
nine
segments.
first,
the
statement
of
the
case,
second,
the
statement
of
california's
position,
thirdly,
a
brief
illustration
by
the
use
of
maps
and
pictures
of
that
position,
fourth,
the
discussion
of
the
basic
dispute
between
the
united
states
government
and
the
state
of
california,
five,
the
discussion
of
the
baseline
involved,
six,
the
application
of
historic
criteria
to
the
california
coast,
seven,
the
application
of
u.s.
criteria
to
the
california
coast,
eight,
the
doctrine
of
historic
waters
as
applied
to
the
california
coast,
and
finally,
a
brief
discussion
of
certain
subsidiary
matters.
turning
first
to
the
statement
of
the
case
and
i
might
add
also
before
i
start,
there
will
be
certain
references
that
i
would
make
to
the
briefs
in
this
matter.
the
opening
brief
is
divided
--
of
the
state
of
california
is
divided
into
two
parts.
they
are
both
blue
briefs.
one
--
the
first
part
is
the
brief
itself
the
second
part
is
an
appendix.
the
closing
brief
is
a
green
brief.
the
principal
references
i
will
make
to
the
extent,
brief
references
are
made
would
be
to
these
two
briefs.
in
1947
in
this
case
this
court
ruled
in
decree
that
california
was
not
the
owner
of
the
submerged
lands
lying
seaward
of
the
ordinary
low
water
mark
and
outside
of
the
inland
waters
of
the
state
and
that
the
united
states
was
possessed
a
paramount
of
rights
in
and
full
dominion
and
power
over
those
submerged
lands
including
minerals.
pursuant
to
the
reserved
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
a
special
master
was
appointed
to
aid
the
court
in
ascertaining
the
low
water
mark
and
the
outer
limits
of
the
inland
waters
along
several
segments
of
the
california
coast.
in
the
final
reference,
the
special
master
was
asked
to
submit
his
recommended
answers
as
to
three
questions
dealing
with
seven
specified
coastal
segments.
the
questions
were
as
follows,
one,
what
is
the
status
inland
waters
or
open
sea
are
particular
channels
and
other
water
areas
between
the
mainland
and
offshore
islands
and
if
inland
waters
then
by
what
criteria
are
the
inland
water
limits
of
any
such
channel
or
other
water
areas
to
be
determined?
two,
are
particular
segments
in
back
bays
or
harbors
constituting
inland
waters
and
from
what
landmarks
of
the
lines
marking
the
seaward
limits
of
bays,
harbors,
rivers,
and
other
inland
waters
to
be
drawn?
and
three,
by
what
criteria
did
the
ordinary
low
water
mark
in
coast
of
california
to
be
ascertained?
after
holding
hearings
the
special
master
filed
his
report
in
the
fall
of
1952
wherein
he
concluded
in
general
that
none
of
the
said
seven
segments
under
consideration
constituted
inland
waters
or
bays
although
the
master
did
hold
that
areas
behind
artificial
harbor
were
constituted
inland
waters.
both
parties
filed
exceptions
to
this
report.
the
case
then
remained
dormant
until
1963.
in
1950,
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
i
believe
that
the
reason
mr.
justice
douglas
was
that
the
congress
at
that
time
was
considering
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
i
--
yes,
we
were
informed
this
morning
justice
douglas
that
he
is
deceased.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
it
was
not
passed
until
1953.
the
master's
report
was
rendered
in
1952.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes,
it
was
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that
is
correct
sir.
after
this
court's
decision
in
the
initial
california
case
in
1947
the
consideration
of
this
matter
by
congress
commenced.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes
it
did
sir
and
there
will
be
certain
references
that
we
will
make
in
the
quotes
to
its
use
or
non-use
of
the
criteria
which
were
set
up
by
the
special
master.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
this
--
this
justice
goldberg
we
believe
is
a
question
that
the
united
states
should
answer.
we
did
not
--
the
state
of
california
did
not
reactivate
this
case.
this
case
was
reactivated
by
a
motion
filed
by
the
united
states.
in
1953
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
exactly.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
exactly,
justice
stewart.
that
was
our
position.
our
position
and
our
answer
to
the
motion
was
that
the
case
was
moot
and
our
position
today
is
that
criteria
which
the
special
master
adopted
in
his
report
are
totally
inapplicable
of
the
situation
as
it
now
presents
itself,
in
view
of
the
changed
legal
situation
and
the
view
of
this
court's
position
in
the
united
states
versus
louisiana
which
is
363
u.s.
1.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
insofar
as
it
was
applicable
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
this
is
correct
sir.
with
the
--
the
master
was
appointed
pursuant
to
orders
of
this
court
to
carry
out
in
effect
the
decree
of
the
court
in
the
1947
first
california
case.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes,
sir.
and
i
proposed
to
discuss
that
in
detail.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
we
suggest
this
your
honor.
we
suggest
that
there
is
enough
presently
in
the
record,
and
presently
in
the
law,
and
presently
in
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
and
particularly
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
united
states
versus
louisiana
363
u.s.
1
for
this
court
can
make
a
decision
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
california's
bays.
this
is
one
segment
of
the
matter
i
will
discuss
this
morning.
we
suggest
that
with
respect
to
what
we
call
our
overall
unit
area
which
i
will
identify
in
a
minute
in
the
santa
barbara
channel
that
the
criteria
which
were
used
by
the
master
are
so
different
and
the
evidence
this
--
the
appraisal
of
the
evidence
so
different
then
is
now
required
by
the
present
status
of
the
law
that
the
matter
should
be
referred
back
to
a
new
master
for
further
consideration.
just
to
comment
on
that
a
little
bit
further,
the
master
took
the
position
that
much
of
the
evidence
referred
by
california
before
the
master
was
not
relevant
because
considerations
of
state
department
practice
in
united
states
foreign
relations
were
determinative
of
the
result
in
that
case.
this
court,
we
believe,
has
found
otherwise
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
louisiana
and
has
found
that
the
matter
was
a
domestic
matter
and
that
the
matter
should
be
governed
by
the
question
of
the
division
of
the
continental
seabed
between
the
nation
and
the
state
as
it's
worded
in
that
case
and
that
being
a
domestic
matter,
a
different
criteria
must
be
applied
and
different
factual
material
is
therefore
relevant
and
i
think
an
examination
of
the
master's
report
itself
will
indicate
that
this
is
true.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes,
sir.
we
believe
that
this
court
can
be
of
considerable
assistance
to
such
a
master
and
in
terms
of
ruling
of
the
basic
premises
which
we
believe
should
now
be
applied
to
the
law
as
it
now
stands
subsequent
to
the
facets
of
the
submerged
lands
act
and
subsequent
to
this
court's
decision
in
u.s.
versus
louisiana,
363
u.s.
1.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
well,
i
think
our
position
is
that
the
united
states
under
the
submerged
lands
act
has
had
granted
to
it
all
of
the
power
which
it
needs
in
terms
of
its
foreign
relations
power.
section
6
of
the
act
retains
the
areas
of
paramount
rights
which
this
court
stated
in
1947
in
the
first
california
case,
the
federal
government
had
in
the
areas
of
foreign
relations,
foreign
commerce,
navigation
and
so
on.
now,
i
believe
this
court
took
the
position
of
the
united
states
versus
louisiana
that
all
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
the
division
of
the
seabed
and
the
subsoil
of
the
continental
shelf
between
the
nation
and
the
state.
there's
no
controversy
between
the
federal
government
and
ourselves
to
the
fact
that
the
continental
shelf
as
a
whole
has
been
claimed
by
the
united
states
as
question
of
dividing
that
shelf
between
the
nation
and
the
state.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
no,
sir.
we
feel
that
one
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
this
is
correct
sir.
this
question
is
specifically
i
believe
discussed
and
you
mentioned
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
no,
sir.
in
fact,
i
think
it's
in
footnote
108
and
page
66
of
your
opinion.
in
that
case,
you
specifically
avoided
fixing
the
coastline
for
louisiana
or
for
any
other
state.
in
1953,
congress
passed
the
submerged
lands
act
which
in
general
restored
to
the
coastal
states
of
the
submerged
lands
lying
within
their
boundaries
subject
to
specific
limitations.
in
the
same
year,
congress
enacted
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
which
provided
the
development
by
the
federal
government
of
that
portion
of
the
continental
shelf
lying
seaward
of
the
area
restored
to
the
states.
the
entire
continental
shelf
of
course
had
previously
by
the
truman
proclamation
of
1945
been
declared
to
have
been
up
to
--
appertain
to
and
then
the
subject
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
in
1963,
the
plaintiff
pursuant
to
an
order
in
this
court
filed
a
supplement
complaint
which
noted
the
passage
of
the
submerged
lands
act
in
1953
and
which
sought
a
decree
declaring
the
extent
of
the
ownership
of
the
united
states
in
the
continental
shelf.
additionally,
the
government
asked
the
court
to
rule
on
the
exceptions
to
the
special
master's
report
previously
filed
by
the
parties.
last
december,
this
court
entered
an
order
allowing
the
parties
to
file
additional
exceptions
and
briefs
in
support
thereof.
this
has
been
done
and
we're
here
today
to
argue
the
original
exceptions
and
also
the
additional
exceptions
which
were
filed
last
--
earlier
this
year.
california's
basic
position
is
as
follows,
it
is
a
state
of
california's
main
contention
of
the
submerged
lands
act
has
completely
destroyed
the
basic
premise
upon
which
the
special
master
based
his
report
by
converting
the
nature
of
this
case
from
one
of
paramount
rights
and
foreign
relations
of
united
states
to
an
interpretation
of
the
intent
of
congress
in
restoring
to
the
states
the
submerged
lands
within
their
historic
boundaries.
the
special
master
as
well
as
the
parties
during
the
proceedings
prior
to1953
believed
and
i
quote
from
the
report
of
the
master
at
page
6,
"that
the
determination
of
the
demarcation
line
at
which
inland
waters
end
and
the
marginal
sea
begins
also
determine
the
exterior
limit
of
the
marginal
belt,
and
therefore
involved
a
question
of
a
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
as
against
foreign
nations
i.e.
a
question
of
external
sovereignty."
with
the
passage
of
the
submerged
lands
act
this
determination,
we
believe,
became
one
of
domestic
concern
exclusively
as
was
pointed
out
in
1960
louisiana
decision
of
this
court.
because
of
this
fundamental
change
in
the
nature
of
the
case,
california
believes
that
the
report
of
the
special
master
in
general
is
no
longer
applicable
to
this
controversy
and
this
court
must
re-determine
the
answers
to
the
questions
posed
to
the
special
master
in
light
of
intent
of
congress.
the
federal
government,
however,
despite
the
louisiana
decision
and
its
own
statements
that
the
apportionment
of
the
sea
beds
and
subsoil
of
the
continental
shelf
between
the
nation
and
the
states
is
a
purely
domestic
matter,
continues
to
characterize
this
case
as
one
involving
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states.
before
delving
into
the
intent
of
congress,
we
would
like
to
illustrate
the
positions
of
the
parties.
we
have
prepared
a
series
of
charts
and
photographs,
individual
copies
of
which
have
been
presented
to
each
member
of
the
court
which
portray
the
segments
of
the
california
coast
and
dispute
before
the
special
master
but
with
the
claims
of
the
party
as
changed
by
the
submerged
lands
act.
the
first
area
we
proposed
to
discuss
or
to
illustrate
briefly
is
the
area
of
bays.
one
segment
of
bays
i
should
mention
we
do
not
have
a
map,
for
that
is
the
crescent
city
segment
that
we
believe
that
that
particular
area
of
map
in
which
appears
in
our
report
has
now
been
primarily
disposed
of
because
of
the
addition
of
the
three-mile
limit.
the
first
chart
shows
monterey
bay
which
is
one
of
the
three
bays
discussed.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
the
first
chart
and
the
first
picture,
the
first
photograph
and
i
should
state
to
this
court
that
these
photographs
are
intended
to
be
as
nearly
accurate
reproductions
as
possible.
we
do
not
claim
and
i
do
not
wish
the
court
to
understand
that
we
claim
that
they
are
entirely
accurate
scale
models
but
they
are
as
accurate
as
we
can
make
them.
the
dimensions,
however
as
they
appear
on
the
charts
themselves
are
completely
accurate.
the
first
chart
shows
monterey
bay,
the
headlands
of
monterey
bay
are
at
point
santa
cruz,
the
pointer
here
and
at
point
pinos.
the
green
line
is
the
line
contended
for
by
the
federal
government
as
being
the
outer
limit
of
inland
waters.
the
red
line
joining
the
head
lands
we
contend
is
the
baseline
from
which
the
inland
water
should
be
or
the
three-mile
limit
should
be
measured.
the
other
red
line
is
the
three-mile
distance.
the
distance
between
these
two
particular
head
lands
is
19.24
miles
and
this
picture
is
looking
south
from
santa
cruz
toward
monterey.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
three
miles
from
what
they
would
call
ordinary
low
water
mark.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that's
correct,
sir,
and
it
follows
the
sinuosities
of
the
case
of
the
coast.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes,
their
position
is
if
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
in
1953
was
governing
and
at
that
time
it
was
the
position
of
the
state
department
that
bays
having
a
line
of
more
than
10
miles
across
were
to
be
considered
open
water
and
inland
waters.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
our
position
is
that
if
it
is
inland
waters
or
put
it
another
way
that
it
is
historic
waters
both
as
a
matter
of
international
law
and
as
a
matter
of
two
california
cases
which
we
cited
in
our
brief,
ocean
industries
versus
greene
and
ocean
industries
versus
the
superior
court
which
is
a
california
supreme
court
case.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
now,
this
three
miles
of
this
line
here,
the
map
42.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
this
is
our
position
is
the
outer
limit
of
inland
waters.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that
is
correct.
and
it's
our
position
that
since
in
our
contention
these
are
inland
waters
and
since
the
submerged
lands
act,
the
coastline
is
measured
from
the
ordinary
low
water
mark
where
it
cuts
the
open
sea
and
from
the
outer
limit
of
inland
waters
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
--
and
this
is
the
proper
line
to
be
drawn.
and
we
also
contend
to
supplement
that
with
the
history
of
california
so
indicate
that
this
bay
is
to
be
considered
inland
waters
and
that
these
two
lawsuits
confirm
this
position
--
two
cases
confirm
the
position.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
this
white
mass
is
all
sea,
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes.
that
is
correct.
because
from
the
photograph
you're
looking
down
from
here
towards
here.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that's
looking
from
here
to
here
looking
down.
this
is
the
second
segment
considered
by
the
special
master.
actually,
there
are
two
segments
involved
here.
these
were
considered
by
the
special
master,
one
involving
the
internal
portion
of
san
pedro
bay.
the
other
involving
the
determination
of
the
point
of
which
the
larger
portion
of
the
bay
might
be
fixed.
i'll
explain
that
somewhat
greater
detail
in
a
moment
and
since
the
passage
of
the
submerged
lands
act
this
is
not
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
the
positions
of
the
state
of
california
and
the
federal
government
as
to
this
bay.
the
submerged
lands
act
provides
that
with
respect
to
that
the
outermost
harbor
works
are
to
be
considered
as
the
fixing
--
in
any
event
fixing
the
limit,
the
minimum
limit
of
inland
waters
and
this
is
the
breakwater
here
completely
encloses
this
harbor
and
the
federal
government
now
concedes
that
the
inland
waters
of
the
state
come
out
at
least
this
far.
that
means
that
the
three-mile
limit
is
formed
by
this
green
line
which
i'm
pointing
here.
it's
the
contention
of
california
that
actually
will
historically
under
the
cases
that
we
have
cited,
the
line
of
san
pedro
bay
should
run
from
point
fermin
to
point
lasuen
this
is
the
case
of
people
versus
carrillo
which
is
cited
in
our
briefs,
the
determination
by
the
united
states
district
court
that
this
area,
this
entire
area
was
then
this
line
here
is
a
bay
and
is
part
of
the
territory
of
california
under
its
constitution
and
under
its
history.
that
would
bring
the
three-mile
limit
out
to
approximately
this
line
here.
the
difference
between
the
two
is
this
square
or
this
triangular
area
up
here.
this
is
looking
northward
from
newport
beach
to
point
fermin.
point
lasuen
which
to
the
point
intended
for
by
the
state
of
california
is
approximately
here
and
the
line
would
go
across
roughly
across
there.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
the
red
line
was
a
line
originally
contended
for
by
california
during
the
course
of
the
hearings
before
the
special
master.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
it
is
our
position
that
the
correct
line
is
the
line
point
lasuen
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes,
sir.
but
we
merely
put
it
inhere
to
avoid
confusion
because
it
had
been
in
fact
plain
in
the
proceeding
before
the
special
master.
it's
a
difference
factually
for
drawing
a
line
from
here
over
here
and
on
here
over
there.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
how
much
water
area?
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
i'll
try
and
give
you
that
figure
in
a
minute.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
well,
the
difference
between
what
california
concedes
and
what
we
claim
is
this
area
in
here.
we
will
try
to
ascertain
it
for
you
to
give
you
the
exact
figure.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
approximately
about
20,000
acres
as
i'm
told
is
the
difference.
is
that
correct?
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
about
6,000
acres
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
the
legal
basis
is
that
point
--
the
location
of
point
lasuen
is
originally
fixed
by
captain
vancouver
who
cruised
up
and
down
the
california
coast
in
1793.
old
california
history
makes
it
a
little
bit
unclear
as
to
exactly
where
that
point
was
located.
however,
judge
stevens
of
the
southern
district
of
california
considered
this
matter
in
the
carrillo
case.
he
fixed
the
point
at
point
lasuen
which
is
in
(inaudible)
below
huntington
beach.
we're
accepting
that
position
on
the
decision
of
judge
stevens
for
the
purpose
of
this
case.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
well,
our
constitution
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
historic
boundaries
as
defined
in
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes,
sir.
and
it's
definition
of
historic
--
its
definition
of
historic
boundary
and
what
we
believe
the
proper
interpretation
of
that
act
to
be
as
applied
to
the
situation
of
california's
bays.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that
is
correct
sir.
we
feel
that
any
other
interpretation
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that
is
correct
sir.
because
we
say
this
and
perhaps
i
can
illustrate
by
using
this
figure.
once
you
determine
that
this
--
let
us
say
you
determine
that
this
line
should
outer
limit
of
inland
waters
then
you
have
determined
the
outer
limited
three-mile
bill
as
well.
in
other
words,
one
automatically
follows
from
the
other
and
we
believe
that
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
entire
act
requires
that
the
act
be
construed
in
terms
of
it's
purposes
to
restore
to
the
state,
their
historic
boundaries
and
to
construe
the
act
in
domestic
terms
not
in
terms
of
united
states
foreign
policy.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
we
believe
that
there
was
and
i
will
read
some
quotations
as
soon
as
we're
through
with
maps
here
which
i
believe
explaining
what
we
think
is
the
intent
of
congress
with
respect
to
how
inland
waters
are
to
be
considered
and
where
the
line
is
to
be
drawn.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that
is
a
man-made
breakwater,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
there's
no
issue
as
to
whether
it's
a
subsequent
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
--
created
them
which
is
one
of
the
minor
issues
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that
is
correct
sir.
this
is
santa
monica
bay
which
falls
north
of
san
pedro
bay,
the
points
are
--
which
enclosed
--
we
claimed
enclosed
the
bay
are
point
dume
and
point
vicente.
we
have
drawn
a
line
across
the
headlands
here,
this
is
25.2
miles
long.
the
green
line
again
represents
the
position
of
the
united
states
with
respect
to
the
limit
of
inland
waters.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
we
again
claim
that
this
is
a
constitutional
bay
under
the
definition
of
california's
constitution
including
all
bays
within
its
territory
of
california.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
it's
both
constitution
and
history,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
california
constitution
also
its
history
in
the
sense
that
we
claim
as
in
the
case
that
we
believe
the
cases
show
this
is
people
versus
stralla
cited
in
our
briefs
that
this
may
also
is
an
historic
bay
having
a
long
history
going
back
to
the
spanish
and
mexican
period.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that
is
correct.
in
this
case,
it
is
25.2
miles.
it
is
possible
to
bring
the
line
down
to
i
think
about
just
about
24
by
drawing
the
line
from
point
dume
to
palos
verdes
point
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
--
which
was
slightly
north.
the
reason
we
have
used
the
particular
line
we
have
is
that
because
this
is
the
line
that
was
used
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
in
considering
this
case.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
we
--
our
basic
position
justice
stewart
is
that
the
24-mile
limit
does
not
have
any
application
at
all.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
so
that
--
if
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that
is
correct.
that
it
may
be
perfectly
proper
for
the
united
states
to
use
in
connection
with
fixing
his
relations
with
other
--
with
four
nations.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
but
then
in
terms
of
fixing
the
line
for
domestic
purposes,
which
we
claim
is
the
test
under
this
situation
we
have
here,
that
it
has
no
relevance.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
if
we're
--
if
we
are
wrong
in
our
historic
as
far
as
the
historic
story
itself
is
concerned,
it's
still
our
position
that
under
california's
constitution,
its
historic
boundaries
which
the
basic
position
of
congress
in
determining
the
limit
of
inland.
we
contend
that
fixing
the
limit
of
inland
waters,
we
still
believe
that
this
will
be
considered
a
bay.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
if
we
are
wrong
on
that
then
we
come
down
to
the
final
position
and
this
is
the
last
and
i
want
to
make
it
clear
and
we
consider
this
as
a
third
string
to
our
ball
which
we
consider
we
do
not
have
to
reach
in
view
of
this
court's
decision
in
u.s.
versus
louisiana.
but
assuming
that
we
do,
it
would
still
be
our
position
that
congress
intended
to
do
equity
here,
that
the
purpose
was
to
restore
the
states
and
the
expectations
that
they
had
at
that
time
that
the
first
california
case
was
decided.
and
then
implying
those
tests
--
those
rules
that
the
united
states
should
do
the
same
equity
of
the
state
of
california
or
do
the
same
thing
to
the
states
that
it
will
do
now
before
our
nation
which
is
to
draw
the
24-mile
limit
--
24-mile
line
but
i
want
to
make
it
absolutely
clear,
we
do
not
primarily
rely
upon
that
position.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
well,
if
you're
referring
to
the
particular
provision,
the
particular
comment,
i
think
you
were
which
i
will
come
to
it
relates
primarily
almost
entirely
i
think
that
santa
barbara
channel
area
i
think
he
was
asking
questions
on
the
floor
to
whether
he
thought
the
channel
could
be
inland
water
and
he
said
he
had
a
very
serious
questions
to
whether
it
could
but
in
effect
that
it
would
depend
on
proof.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes
i
will.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes,
sir.
this
picture
here
is
a
picture
of
santa
monica
bay
looking
north
at
this
point.
this
would
be
the
point
vicente
approximately
up
here
would
palos
verdes
point.
this
is
the
same
--
this
is
looking
south
from
the
north
end
of
the
bay
down
toward
the
south
end
bay
toward
palos
verdes
point.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
this
next
bay
which
is
a
bay
having
no
legal
cases
involving
it
but
which
we
claim
a
similar
nature
to
the
other
bays
which
there
are
adjudications
is
san
luis
obispo
bay.
this
extends
form
point
san
luis
to
point
south.
the
differences
between
the
united
states
position
and
the
california
position
are
shown
by
the
difference
between
the
green
line
and
the
--
this
outer
red
line.
this
is
the
san
luis
obispo
bay
looking
south.
this
large
map
for
which
we
have
no
corresponding
picture
represents
the
so-called
“overall
unit
area
of
california
waters”.
it
includes
the
area
extending
from
point
conception
south
to
point
loma
--
near
point
loma
in
san
diego.
i
think
the
u.s.
claim
--
the
position
of
the
u.s.
claim,
the
green
line
is
perfectly
clear.
the
california
claim,
the
red
line,
i
think,
should
also
be
clear.
the
only
line
which
may
require
a
brief
explanation
is
the
so-called
“(inaudible)
line”,
this
is
california
boundary
per
indications
on
u.s.
maps.
you
will
find
attached
to
our
closing
brief
in
the
pocket
part
some
maps
of
the
united
states
as
of
1885
and
1963.
these
maps
contain
extensions
of
county
boundaries
out
into
the
water
areas
off
of
the
coast
of
california.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
--
by
joining
in
effect
the
ends
of
these
points
of
these
lines
you're
drawn
on
these
united
states
maps
it
is
possible
to
construct
this
blue
line,
we
claim
not
that
this
is
an
alternative
line
but
merely
that
this
gives
some
support
to
the
position
that
we
take
regarding
the
fact
that
this
area
is
to
be
considered
internal
waters
or
parts
of
the
territory
of
the
state
of
california.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
they
are
army
engineers
maps.
excuse
me,
department
of
the
interior
maps,
the
first
one
being
1885.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
i
think
we
have
those
figures
here.
we'll
try
to
give
them
to
you.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
if
i
may
we'll
give
you
that
figure
after
the
numerous
sets.
we'll
have
that
figure
for
you.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
i
think
that's
correct,
sir,
because
we
again
view
this
problem
and
i
get
back
i
think
always
to
the
same
point
that
congress
has
the
power
to
divide
the
subsoil
between
the
nation
and
the
state.
i
think
as
this
court
said
in
the
u.s.
versus
louisiana
pursuant
to
the
right
of
congress
to
distribute
or
to
disclose
the
federal
property,
it
would
have
the
right
to
divide
this
or
to
grant
this
property
to
the
states.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
not
that
i
know
sir
because
it
was
our
understanding
that
when
this
matter
was
allowed
to
lie
dormant
in
1952
that
it
had
died
and
naturally,
taking
that
position,
we
did
not
--
the
state
did
not
take
any
further
action,
no
matter
not
being
reactivated
until
last
december.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
there
has
been
drilling
for
oil
i
think
in
all
of
these
bays.
san
pedro
bay
of
course
think
a
great
deal
of
oil
and
santa
barbara
channel
area
contains
a
great
deal
of
oil.
monterey
bay,
to
the
best
of
my
recollection,
been
no
successful
drilling.
santa
monica
bay,
they're
just
starting
to
drill.
san
luis
obispo,
i
don't
think
we
know
of
any
that
i
know
of
at
this
point.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
no.
the
situation
has
been
of
course
as
a
practical
matter
of
perspective
less
easier
reluctant
to
take
a
chance
on
who's
right.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
well,
our
position
again
justice
white
is
this,
that
section
6
of
the
submerged
lands
act
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
even
to
these
properties
which
are
granted
back
to
the
state
whatever
may
be,
that
this
--
the
paramount
rights
with
respect
to
foreign
relations,
commerce,
and
other
activities
which
are
granted
the
federal
government
by
the
constitution
are
expressly
reserved
to
the
federal
government
and
even
in
those
areas
to
which
the
property
interest
are
transferred
back
to
the
states,
these
paramount
rights
which
this
court
determined
belong
to
the
federal
government
in
u.s.
versus
california
still
remain.
they
are
not
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
we
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
no,
i
don't
say
that.
what
i
say
is,
they
gave
the
property
on
the
sea
bed
and
the
subsoil
on
the
continental
shelf,
this
portion
of
it
back
to
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that
is
all
we
are
concerned
with
here
and
the
point
--
and
the
purpose
of
it
is
simply
to
determine
where
the
measuring
line
ought
to
be.
how
do
you
measure
the
lines?
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes,
that's
true.
and
this
--
and
this
court
i
say
said
this,
again
in
u.s.
versus
louisiana.
it
said
there
might
be
a
different
boundary
for
internat
--
for
purposes
of
foreign
relations
than
there
might
be
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
i
say
that's
absolutely
true
and
i
say
that's
what
this
court
said.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
pardon?
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
exactly,
my
position
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
well,
let
me
show
you
about
why
that
might
not
be
true,
justice
white
and
i
give
you
this
best
example
i
think
it's
probably
texas.
now,
that
all
work
intending
for
let
me
make
it
clear
three
miles,
we're
not
contending
for
three
leagues
is
this
texas
or
this
court
found
that
in
fact
texas
had.
the
situation
you
can
have
in
texas
is
that
under
--
for
domestic
purposes
and
under
the
submerged
lands
act
the
--
this
court
and
in
effect
stated
that
--
that
the
--
this
marginal
belt
here
that
goes
out
not
three
miles
but
goes
on
in
effect
to
ten-and-a-half
miles.
on
the
other
hand,
for
foreign
relations
purposes,
this
country
or
the
federal
government
is
perfectly
free
to
maintain
for
international
purposes
that
the
limit
of
inland
waters
for
international
purposes
only
is
three
miles
and
not
ten-and-a-half
miles.
i
say,
or
we
say
that
this
court
is
determined
that
those
boundaries
--
the
domestic
boundaries
for
the
purpose
of
dividing
the
subsoil
and
the
foreign
bound
--
or
which
you
might
call
a
foreign
relations
boundary
for
the
purpose
of
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states
may
be
different.
we
say
this
court
said
exactly
that.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
now,
to
summarize
the
basic
dispute
between
the
two
parties,
the
u.s.
position
can
in
effect,
can
seize
the
division
of
the
continental
shelf
between
the
nation
and
the
states
under
the
submerged
lands
act
as
a
domestic
matter.
but
the
united
states
insists
that
the
criteria
for
affecting
that
division
or
to
be
ascertained
from
the
united
states
foreign
relations
practice
as
of
the
date
of
the
submerged
lands
act
of
the
california
position
is
diametrically
opposed.
it's
california's
position
that
congress
was
basically
overriding
the
result
as
to
ownership
of
submerged
lands
of
the
original
california,
louisiana
and
texas
decisions
by
restoring
the
states
those
submerged
lands
lying
within
their
historic
boundaries
subject
to
certain
limitations
which
were
expressly
set
out
in
the
act.
congress
was
also
in
enacting
the
submerged
lands
act
accepting
the
invitation
of
this
court
in
the
california
case
to
do
equity
of
the
states.
in
this
context,
california
believes
that
the
criteria
for
affecting
the
division
of
the
continental
shelf
should
be
ascertained
by
reference
to
a
state's
historic
boundaries
and
for
additional
expectations,
irrespective
of
state
department
practice.
we
believe
that
the
government
is
attempting
to
use
or
abuse,
if
you
will,
the
foreign
relations
power
of
the
executive
to
frustrate
the
intent
of
congress
in
a
strictly
domestic
federal-state
matter.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
well
our
position
then
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
well
in
part,
we're
not
just
depending
on
the
interpretation
of
the
act
at
such.
we're
in
effect
depending
upon
this
court's
ruling
in
the
second
u.s.
versus
louisiana
case
in
saying
what
the
submerged
lands
act
meant.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that
is
correct,
because
we
feel
that
this
court's
opinion
in
the
original
u.s.
versus
california
case
made
it
rather
clear
that
the
state
of
california
had
no
rights,
power
or
dominion
in
or
over
any
of
the
area
below
the
ordinary
lower
water
mark
or
outside
of
inland
waters.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
we
think
we
could
with
respect
to
inland
waters
but
we
don't
think
they
would
be
as
strong
as
they
now
are.
the
reason
we
say
they
are
stronger
now
is
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
position
was
the
same
then.
i
can't
state
exactly
what
arguments
were
made
because
at
that
time
i
was
not
counsel.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
in
terms
of
the
way
the
decision
was
--
came
down,
they
probably
were
not
any
good
except
possibly
with
respect
to
the
definition
of
inland
waters
and
again,
that
would
only
be
possible.
we
claim
that
with
respect
to
the
situation
as
it
now
exists
under
the
submerged
lands
act
and
considering
the
history
of
the
submerged
lands
act
the
congress
made
it
clear
that
it
wished
the
determination
of
inland
waters
and
the
nature
of
inland
waters
to
be
determined
primarily
by
the
prior
cases
of
this
court
decided,
prior
to
first
the
united
states
versus
california.
basically,
in
effect
going
back
to
the
rule
of
pollard's
lessee
versus
hagan
to
determine
what
were
or
were
not
inland
waters
and
this
was
so
stated
i
have
a
few
quotations
here
on
the
floor
and
in
the
committee
with
respect
to
the
intent
of
congress
in
passing
the
act
and
how
inland
waters
were
to
be
determined.
now,
if
the
resolution
of
this
dispute
depends
primarily,
we
contend
in
the
intent
of
congress
both
parties
agree
that
congress
in
exercising
its
constitutional
power
to
dispose
a
federal
property
could
have
divided
the
continental
shelf
between
the
nations
and
states
in
anyway
it
saw
fit,
and
that
the
dispute
over
the
extent
of
that
division
depends
upon
the
intent
of
the
congress.
the
parties
also
agree
that
with
the
truman
proclamation
in
1945
the
entire
continental
shelf
came
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
and
the
division
of
shelf
between
federal
and
the
state
governments
involves
a
purely
domestic
matter
in
no
wise
affecting
the
international
relations
of
the
united
states.
we
say
that
this
court
has
already
ruled
in
the
second
louisiana
case
in
the
basic
intent
of
the
congress
and
enacting
the
submerged
lands
act.
the
test,
we
contend,
that
should
be
applied
in
ascertaining
the
extent
of
the
division
is
one
of
the
state's
boundaries
upon
admission,
not
u.s.
foreign
relations.
in
the
louisiana
case,
the
court
noted
that
the
fixing
of
a
state's
boundaries
as
a
function
of
congress
and
cannot
be
fixed
by
executive
action
and
we
have
cited
certain
cases
with
respect
thereto.
the
legislative
history
of
the
submerged
lands
act
shows
that
congress
intended
the
division
of
the
continental
shelf
to
be
in
terms
of
state
historic
boundaries
and
not
to
be
effective
or
affected
by
united
states
international
relations.
the
report
of
the
senate
committee
on
interior
and
insular
affairs
and
the
numerous
statements
of
the
author
senator
holland
and
the
senate
floor
manager
senator
cordon,
the
senate
majority
leader
and
the
other
leading
supporters
of
the
act
leave
no
doubt
as
to
the
purpose
and
intent
of
congress
in
enacting
this
legislation,
namely
to
modify
the
prior
decision
on
this
case
and
to
restore
to
the
state's
ownership
of
the
submerged
lands
within
their
historic
boundaries.
for
example,
we
have
quoted
from
a
senate
community
report
that
appears
in
our
opening
brief
at
page
10.
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
is
to
write
the
law
for
the
future
as
the
supreme
court
believed
it
to
be
in
the
past
that
the
state
shall
own
and
have
proprietary
use
of
all
lands
under
navigable
waters
within
their
territorial
jurisdiction
whether
inland
or
seaward,
subject
only
to
the
governmental
powers
delegated
to
the
united
states
by
the
constitution.
senator
holland
also
stated
and
this
quotation
appears
in
the
government's
answering
in
brief
at
page
20,
“this
joint
resolution
will
confirm
to
the
maritime
state
of
which
there
are
20,
the
rights
which
they
had
respectively
enjoyed
since
the
founding
of
our
nation
and
up
to
the
date
of
the
decision
in
the
california
case
in
their
offshore
lands
and
waters
which
lie
within
their
constitutional
boundaries.”
their
quotations
in
similar
vein
from
senator
holland,
senator
cordon,
senator
daniel,
senator
taft
and
others.
as
texas
pointed
out
in
its
brief
in
the
second
louisiana
case
determines
historic
state
boundaries
original
boundaries
and
for
additional
state
boundaries
were
used
over
1,000
times
throughout
the
legislative
history
of
this
act.
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
congress
spring
the
act
in
terms
of
restoring
to
the
states
the
submerged
lands
within
the
state
boundaries
at
the
time
of
admission
to
the
union.
in
addition,
there
is
no
doubt
that
congress
was
aware
that
it
was
dealing
with
a
domestic
matter
and
not
with
a
question
of
foreign
relations.
now,
this
particular
point
was
made
clear
by
the
testimony
of
deputy
state
department
legal
adviser
tate
before
the
senate
committee
and
his
testimony
in
turn
was
later
quoted
on
the
senate
floor.1
we
have
discussed
that
testimony
in
detail
that
they
just
35
to
50
of
the
second
volume
of
our
opening
brief
which
is
the
appendix.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
alright,
your
honor,
we'll
then
have
to
look
if
you
will
at
the
provisions
of
section
2
(c),
i
believe
it
is,
which
defines
coastline
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
--
and
if
you
will
see
the
definition
of
coastline,
in
effect
states
that,
for
example,
where
your
coast
fronts
the
open
sea
then
your
measurement
will
be
from
the
ordinary
low
water
mark
along
the
coast.
in
other
words,
the
three
miles
will
go
out
here.
however,
where
you
have
inland
water
as
we
would
contend
this
bay,
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
it
is,
then
you
have
to
determine
where
the
seaward
limit
of
your
inland
waters
are
and
let
us
assume
again
for
the
sake
of
this
discussion
that
that
is
this
line
here.
then
the
measurement
is
made
from
the
outer
limit
of
inland
waters
outward
for
the
three
miles.
in
other
words,
if
this
area
is
to
be
considered
inland
water
you
have
to
make
the
measurement
from
here
not
from
back
here.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
it
doesn't
help
a
great
deal,
your
honor.
we
have
certain
quotations
from
legislative
history
which
i'll
get
to
in
a
minute
with
respect
to
discussions.
there
were
certain
amendments
offered
to
the
provisions
defining
--
an
attempt
was
in
fact
made
to
define
inland
waters
and
it
was
not
successful.
thereafter,
there
were
certain
discussion
on
the
floor
and
in
the
committee
which
i
will
discuss
and
read
from
quotations
which
i
do
think
are
helpful
and
i
think
it
was
clearly
the
intention,
we
contend,
to
first
of
all
leave
inland
waters
as
they
were
before
this
court's
decision
in
the
first
california
case,
and
secondly,
there
are
certain
comments
by
senator
anderson
and
others
which
i
will
read
trying
to
define
at
least
in
general
terms
what
are
inland
waters.
we
agree
there's
not
very
much
in
the
history
on
that
point.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
i
don't
think
so
sir.
i
wonder
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
i
think
that
comment,
if
i
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
i
think
he
was
referring
only
and
as
i
understand
it
to
this
particular
area
here
and
if
this
is
the
area
about
which
is
i
remember
that
question,
he
was
questioned
by
douglas
as
to
whether
he
thought
this
whole
channel
here
to
be
considered
inland
waters.
and
he
expressed
an
opinion
that
he
didn't
think
so.
i
think
that's
if
i
remember
the
quotation
correctly,
that's
the
one
to
which
he
was
referring.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
well,
i
don't
think
he
quite
said
that.
i
think
what
he
was
really
commenting
on
when
i
say
so
sir
was
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
area
here
could
be
considered
inland
waters.
in
other
words
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
well,
there
would
be
difference
--
difference
for
a
number
of
reasons.
in
other
words,
historically
landlocked
bays,
for
example,
has
been
considered
inland
water.
certain
types
of
historic
bays
had
been
considered
inland
water.
the
history
of
the
act
makes
it
clear
that
as
to
those
areas
which
were
historically
and
by
case
law
this
court
and
other
courts
considered
to
be
inland
waters
those
waters
--
in
those
cases,
you
measure
from
the
outer
limits
of
those
inland
waters.
for
example,
if
this
bay
was
to
be
considered
inland
waters
then
you
measure
from
the
outer
limit
of
the
bay.
the
question
as
i
understand
it
in
the
context
in
which
he
was
asked
is
whether
this
whole
area
here
in
the
santa
barbara
channel
could
be
inland
water.
and
i
think
senator
holland
expressed
very
serious
reservations
about
that,
but
i
think
he
also
made
it
clear,
basically
that
it
was
really
a
matter
of
proof
that
he
didn't
think
he
could
be
proven
but
it
was
not
foreclosed.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
well,
they
vary
in
depth.
it
is
perfectly
true
that
the
bays
in
the
west
coast
of
the
united
states
tend
to
be
somewhat
deeper.
the
east
coast
bay
primarily
what
geologically
we
call
brown
valley
these
are
a
little
different,
we
have
sharp
problem.
however,
we
contend
that
under
these
case
laws
starting
with
ocean
industries
cases
on
monterey
bay,
the
carrillo
case
on
san
pedro
bay,
the
stralla
case
on
santa
monica
bay
that
they
have
applied
the
same
principles,
the
same
legal
principles
to
those
bays
which
have
been
applied
in
prior
cases
involving
chesapeake
bay
and
delaware
bay
on
the
east
coast
and
that
essentially
there
is
no
difference.
it's
a
legal
matter
between
those
bays,
both
as
to
history
and
the
criteria
which
have
been
applied
in
determining
that
they
are
inland
waters.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
i
think
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that
is
correct
sir.
in
the
case
of
--
i
think
we
have
the
stipulation
or
have
had
a
stipulation
in
the
past
with
the
united
states
with
respect
to
san
francisco
bay
a
small
portion
of
san
pedro
bay,
only
the
very
internal
portion
and
san
diego
bay.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
not
--
not
quite
that
extreme.
no,
sir.
now,
the
act
itself
clearly
reserves
to
the
federal
government
control
in
those
areas
including
foreign
relations
over
which
the
national
government
has
paramount
rights.
during
the
senate
committee
hearings
on
the
act,
the
original
definition
of
coastline
which
is
in
section
2
(c)
and
inland
waters
was
amended.
the
amendment
deleted
after
inland
waters
and
this,
i
might
say,
appears
on
pages
21
and
22
of
volume
i
of
our
opening
brief,
the
amendment
deleted
after
inland
water
is
the
words
“which
include
all
estuaries
ports,
harbors,
bays,
channels,
straits,
historic
bays
and
sands,
and
all
other
bodies
of
water
which
join
the
open
sea.”
one
of
the
reasons
given
for
this
amendment
by
senator
cordon
the
acting
chairman
was
that,
“it
was
sought
not
to
get
into
that
field
because
you
were
in
appeal
then
where
in
our
attempts
to
take
care
of
a
purely
domestic
matter,
we
might
be
putting
the
united
states
on
record
with
a
president
which
we
intended
only
to
apply
domestically
but
which
might
be
applied
internationally.”
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
closing
brief,
attempts
were
made
once
in
committee
and
for
or
five
times
in
the
floor
of
the
senate
and
the
house
to
frame
the
acts
in
terms
of
or
by
reference
the
united
states
foreign
relations.
the
congress
did
not
accept
any
of
these
proposals.
many
reasons
can
be
given
for
the
defeat
of
each
proposal
but
the
important
point
is
that
these
attempts
to
frame
or
limit
the
act
by
reference
to
criteria
other
than
historic
boundaries
were
uniformly
rejected
by
congress.
in
some
then
we
say,
that
the
congress
knew
that
it
was
dealing
with
domestic
matter
and
framed
the
submerged
lands
act
by
reference
to
a
state
historic
boundaries
and
not
by
reference,
the
state
department
practiced
in
1850
in
1953
or
now.
we
believe
that
this
court
has
already
ruled
the
second
louisiana
case
on
the
aspect
of
congressional
intent
behind
the
submerged
lands
act
and
we
believe
correctly.
we
now
turn
to
a
determinate
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
i
think
they
were
leaving
a
question
of
the
termination
of
what
would
constitute
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
never
been
a
california
case.
this
is
what
we
say
in
other
words
our
position
is
that
you
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
i
think
that's
--
that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
well,
i
think
they
did
make
this
final
determination.
i
think
you
did
make
the
final
determination
if
i
understand
your
second
louisiana
case
correctly
that
you
have
made
the
determination
that
this
is
a
domestic
matter,
that
intent
of
congress
was
to
consider
this
domestically,
as
this
quotation
i
believe
indicates,
and
that
he
problem
is
truly
one
of
the
division
domestically
of
this
area
between
the
nation
and
the
state
with
respect
to
the
question
of
inland
waters
as
a
question
of
going
back
and
i
think
the
quotations
i
will
give
support
this,
going
back
to
the
doctrine
of
pollard's
lessee
versus
hagan
and
the
cases
which
have
followed
which
this
court
has
decided
over
a
period
as
the
one
of
the
senators
said,
of
150
years.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
well,
we
say
that
the
as
one
of
the
senators
said
in
the
floor,
i
think
that
there
have
been
over
50
decisions
of
this
court
and
some
200
decisions
of
other
federal
courts
defining
in
some
face
or
other
inland
waters.
as
i
believe
senator
holland
said
there
is
no
one
case
in
which
you
can
find
a
good
definition
of
inland
waters
but
you
have
to
take
them
all
together
in
effect.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
well,
i
think
i
can
be
of
some
help.
we
have
one
citation
which
unfortunately
is
not
in
our
brief
but
it
is
in
the
congressional
record.
i
will
give
the
citation.
it's
99
congressional
record
at
page
3004
and
5,
it
is
the
statement
by
senator
anderson.
i
think
it's
directly
in
answer
to
your
point.
in
defining
inland
waterways
and
i'm
quoting,
“we
mean
rivers,
lakes,
including
the
great
lakes,
streams,
bays,
and
harbors.
the
land
bits
underneath
these
inland
waters
undoubtedly
and
undeniably
belong
to
the
states.”
we
also
mean
other
bodies
of
water
along
the
atlantic
coast
such
as
long
island
sound
although
not
falling
precisely
within
the
definition
cited
above
which
have
been
judicially
determined
to
be
inland
waters.
their
beds
then
likewise
belong
to
the
states.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
no.
no,
i
might
say
also
that
senator
holland,
senator
long,
and
senator
daniel
also
spoke
of
the
case
law.
and
among
the
--
immediately
following
this
quotation
i
think
in
examination
of
this
particular
little
area
in
the
record
will
indicate
clearly
that
it
was
their
intention
to
talk
about
the
act
as
it
came
out
not
about
anything
that
might
have
been
removed
by
the
amendment.
now,
i
think
senator
holland
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
nothing
was
removed
by
the
amendment.
they
did
not
want
to
put
in
a
provision,
however,
which
they
felt
might
affect
the
united
states
in
its
international
relations.
they
simply
wanted
to
leave
the
situation
as
they
found
it.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
no,
sir.
and
as
i
think
i
mentioned
once
before
in
note
108
in
page
66
of
your
opinion
in
that
case
you
expressly
did
not
decide
the
question,
you
stated
that
you
were
not
deciding
where
the
coastline
of
the
state
of
california
or
state
of
louisiana
or
any
other
state
lay.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
whatever
it
was
but
you
didn't
decide
what
it
was.
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
no,
sir.
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
i
think
mr.
cox
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
--
will
answer
that.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
now,
the
government
insists
that
the
baseline
established
by
the
submerged
lands
act
is
identical
and
intentionally
so
to
the
baseline
used
in
the
original
decree
in
the
first
california
case.
therefore,
they
argue
the
criteria
for
ascertaining
the
location
of
this
baseline
are
to
be
determined
by
united
states
foreign
policy.
the
united
states
however
shows
no
support
for
the
conclusion
which
obviously
runs
counter
to
the
basic
philosophy
of
the
act.
the
effect
of
the
government's
position
is
to
have
the
extent
of
built
up
land
restored
to
the
states
determined
by
state
department
practice
since
fixing
the
baseline
by
such
practice,
obviously,
fixes
the
extent
of
the
area
restored.
if
congress
has
clearly
intended
that
it
did
not
intend
such
a
result
and
the
court
is
rejected
such
an
approach
in
the
second
louisiana
case.
an
examination
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
shows
that
congress
rejected
using
u.s.
foreign
relations
as
the
criteria
for
establishing
the
baseline
under
the
act.
this
was
most
notably
shown
when
the
senate
committee
and
executives'
session
amended
the
definition
of
inland
waters
to
exclude
the
phrase
quote
“which
includes
estuaries,
ports,
harbors,
bays,
channels,
straits,
historic
bays
and
all
other
bodies
of
water
which
join
the
open
sea.”
the
senate
committee
report
in
commenting
on
this
amendment
stated
then
i
quote
this
is
the
senate
report
at
page
18
and
our
brief
at
pages
21
and
22,
“the
elimination
of
the
language
in
the
committee's
opinion
is
consistent
with
the
velocity
of
the
holland
bill
to
place
the
states
in
the
position
in
which
both
they
and
the
federal
government
thought
they
were
for
more
than
a
century-and-a-half
and
not
to
create
any
situation
with
respect
thereto.”
during
the
committee
debates
in
this
amendment,
senator
long
expressed
fear
of
having
a
state
department
determine
whether
certain
areas
constituted
inland
waters.
some
of
the
other
senators
clearly
indicated
that
this
was
not
of
the
intent
of
the
bill,
for
example,
senator
cordon.
this
quotation
approves
that
pages
27
and
28
of
the
second
volume
of
our
opening
brief,
“the
elimination
of
the
language
still
follows
what
the
chair
understands
to
be
the
philosophy
of
the
bill,
that
we
are
putting
the
states
where
they
thought
they
were
and
not
attempting
now
to
create
either
a
situation
in
law
or
a
basis
for
a
rule
of
evidence
that
may
or
may
not
have
been
sound
when
the
states
came
into
the
union.”
i
believe
that
the
elimination
of
the
language
does
that.
i
believe
that
it
will
not
prejudice
any
state
in
account
of
anything
in
this
bill.
it
may
not
do
as
good
a
job
for
some
state
as
it
would
have
the
congress
legislatively
met
the
state's
contention
and
agreed
with
it.
but
as
i
understand
it,
what
we
seek
to
do
is
neither
to
agree
nor
to
disagree
but
to
announce
legislatively
that
we
seek
to
place
to
place
the
states
in
the
position
the
states
believe
themselves
to
be
in
prior
to
the
california
decision
and
to
leave
to
them
at
the
same
time
every
remedy
in
the
courts
of
this
country
that
they
then
had
or
thought
they
had
with
reference
to
what
they
thought
was
theirs.
and
then
there
is
a
comment
by
senator
daniel
which
we've
also
quoted
second
volume
of
our
opening
brief
page
27.
senator
daniel,
“mr.
chairman,
i
would
vote
for
senator
long's
amendment
of
his
offer
by
i
agreed
fully
with
the
chairman
that
the
striking
these
words
was
not
done
in
any
manner
to
prejudice
the
rights
of
the
states
and
that
the
effect
would
not
be
to
bind
this
to
the
boxed
formula
or
anybody
else
in
this
formula.”
i
just
want
to
state
for
the
record
if
this
record
is
ever
used
in
the
future
and
the
final
comment
by
senator
anderson
volume
ii
of
our
opening
brief
at
page
34,
“i
subscribe
fully
to
what
the
chairman
said
quite
awhile
ago
in
pointing
out
that
this
bill
does
not
seek
to
take
away
from
our
add
to
the
position
of
these
states
as
they
came
into
the
union.
now,
it's
obvious
from
these
expressions
of
underlying
philosophy
that
congress
intended
historic
criteria
to
govern
the
baseline
established
by
the
act.
now,
these
historic
criteria,
we
contend,
are
not
affected
in
any
way
by
the
united
states
foreign
policy
as
of
1953.
now,
relating
the
baseline
and
particularly
inland
waters
to
historic
criteria,
it
must
mean
those
water
areas
the
states
considered
to
be
part
of
their
territory
when
they
were
admitted
into
the
union
excluding
of
course
the
marginal
belt,
those
areas
over
which
the
--
in
other
words
those
areas
over
which
the
states
have
historically
exercised
jurisdiction.
again,
to
quote
senator
holland,
this
appears
in
the
testimony
before
senate
committee
in
the
1953
hearings
at
page
48
and
i
quote,
“but
the
language
of
the
bill
is
perfectly
clear
and
that
it
is
the
constitutional
boundaries
and
it
is
the
historic
boundaries
and
it
is
a
case
of
restoration
and
establishment
to
the
states
of
what
lie
within
their
boundaries
or
jurisdiction,
a
criminal
law
and
a
various
other
kinds
of
laws
boundaries
which
fix
the
venues
of
cases
which
arise.”
now,
the
validity
of
a
state's
historic
boundaries,
we
say,
should
not
be
tested
by
some
technical
and
changing
criteria
devised
by
the
state
department
which
may
be
valid
for
international
relations
but
which
have
no
bearing
on
federal-state
relations.
when
questioned
during
the
senate
hearings
about
the
location
of
the
coastline
in
inland
waters,
senator
cordon
stated
and
this
appears
in
our
closing
brief
pages
22
and
23
and
footnote
9,
“the
matter
if
inland
waters
are
one
which
has
been
defined
time
and
time
again
by
the
courts
not
i
believe
in
one
all
inclusive
definition.”
in
committee
hearing,
senator
cordon
also
stated
and
this
is
the
1953
hearing
at
page
1384,
“there
is
no
question
in
the
chairman's
mind
that
is
that
we
are
not
bound
by
any
opinion,
expert
or
otherwise,
that
is
not
comprehended
in
the
statutes
of
the
united
states
or
in
the
decisions
of
its
courts.”
i
have
already
read
senator
anderson's
comment.
now,
to
contrast
with
this
is
the
position
of
the
special
masters.
he
framed
his
recommended
answers
on
the
premise
that
the
issues
would
be
determined
by
reference
to
united
states
foreign
relations
and
external
sovereignty.
as
i
have
already
pointed
out,
i
have
already
pointed
this
out
but
i
would
like
to
read
a
quote
from
his
report,
it
appears
in
volume
i
of
our
opening
brief
at
page
34.
he
states,
“under
these
circumstances
adjudication
of
the
status
of
the
water
areas
here
in
controversy
must
depend
upon
whether
there
has
been
effective
assertion
by
the
united
states
and
its
international
relations
of
the
criteria
proposed
by
california.”
and
as
i
believe
we've
already
pointed
out,
this
not
a
test
which
appears
in
the
submerged
lands
act.
now,
the
special
master
also
noted
and
this
is
at
page
39
of
this
report
that
the
evidence
concerning
the
geography,
the
history
and
the
economic
importance
of
the
water
area
in
dispute
would
have
been
relevant
if
there
had
been
any
assertion
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
these
waters
by
or
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
but
under
his
approach,
the
evidence
was
considered
irrelevant.
in
view
of
the
purpose
of
the
submerge
lands
act
and
senator
holland's
remarks
concerning
historic
boundaries
and
boundaries
of
jurisdiction,
this
evidence,
we
believe,
is
now
relevant
and
critical.
consequently,
we
believe
that
the
special
master's
report
is
not
an
appropriate
vehicle
for
resolving
the
present
dispute.
in
this
regard,
we
believe,
that
the
evidence
presented
to
the
special
master
and
any
additional
evidence
which
would
now
be
relevant
under
the
change
rules
applicable
should
and
must
be
reevaluated
in
light
of
the
proper
criteria
to
be
applied
under
the
submerged
lands
act.
as
far
as
the
basic
concerned,
however,
we
believe
that
all
of
the
evidence
principles
and
legal
materials
necessary
are
before
this
court
and
that
this
aspect
of
the
case
can
be
disposed
of
now.
as
to
the
island
boundary
in
the
question
of
waters
intervened
the
mainland
and
the
offshore
islands.
we
feel
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
refer
the
case
again
to
a
new
special
master
to
evaluate
the
evidence
and
take
new
evidence
based
on
the
proper
principles
to
be
applied
as
to
be
announced
in
a
decision
in
this
case.
we
now
turn
to
an
application
of
historic
criteria
to
the
calif
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
well,
the
special
master
took
the
position
that
any
evidence
regarding
economic
conditions,
historical
conditions
or
search
into
sovereignty
for
example
by
california
any
material
of
that
sort
would
not
be
relevant
because
this
position
was
as
i
read
this
quotation,
“it's
entirely
a
matter
of
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states.”
this
is
all
i
wanted
to
hear
about
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
there
is
indeed
a
great
deal
of
evidence
already
in
the
record.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that
is
correct.
we
say
that
because
the
premise
in
the
basic
law
which
is
now
applicable
has
changed
the
master's
premise
is
no
longer
applicable.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes,
i
think
there
would
be
still
more.
i
can't
honestly
tell
you
how
much
more
but
i
would
feel
confident
there
would
still
be
more.
in
fact
i'm
sure
that
if
this
premise
is
accepted
there
would
be
much
more
effort
put
into
framing
the
evidence
to
meet
these
would
now
be
relevant
considerations.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
absent
the
submerged
lands
act
and
the
united
states
versus
california
the
first
case
before
us
i
think
we
would
be
in
a
rather
bad
way.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
not
entirely
but
the
argument
doesn't
have
the
strength,
we
say,
that
it
does
have
because
of
the
submerged
lands
act
and
because
of
the
basic
philosophy
of
the
act.
we
would
still
have
the
argument
that
the
bays
as
such
for
example
are
inland
waters
under
the
decisions
of
the
california
supreme
court
and
the
federal
courts
and
that
properly
comparing
those
decisions
involving
chesapeake
bay
and
delaware
bay
that
they
should
be
considered
inland
waters,
that
they
should
not
be
rejected
as
inland
waters
as
did
the
special
master.
we
say
that
allegation
or
that
position
to
be
taken
independently
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
i
think
--
i
think
if
i
look
for
this
way.
if
i
were
arguing
taking
the
position
i
would
have
modified
them.
i
don't
know
how
someone
else
might
have
treated
it.
the
question
of
applying
historic
or
constitutional
criteria
to
the
california
coast
at
the
outset
we
should
like
to
state
that
we
believe
categorically
that
the
bays
of
california
including
the
great
bays
of
california
that
we
have
illustrated
here
fall
clearly
within
california's
constitutional
boundaries,
we
based
this
on
the
following.
the
starting
point
in
discussing
california's
bays
are
constitutional
which
provides
in
the
boundary
description
and
i
quote
“also
all
the
islands,
harbors
and
bays
along
and
adjacent
to
the
pacific
coast.”
this
quotation
appears
in
our
opening
brief
at
page
54.
in
our
opening
brief
at
page
36,
we
also
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
this
is
the
constitution
of
1849
approved
by
the
congress
in
the
admission
act
of
september
9,
1850.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
now,
it's
our
position
that
this
phrase
“also
all
the
bays”
means
all
those
areas
which
were
recognized
as
such
in
1850,
irrespective
of
size
or
any
transitory
technical
criteria.
we
say
that
all
of
these
bays
are
part
of
california
and
are
inland
waters
within
the
meaning
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
we
also
believe
that
this
interpretation
of
the
phrase
all
bays
is
exactly
what
was
comprehended
in
the
typical
expression
of
the
day
concerning
the
delimitation
of
the
marginal
sea.
the
secretary
of
state
buchanan
wrote
in
1849
the
exact
year
that
california
promulgated
its
constitution
and
this
quotation
and
the
reference
to
it
appears
in
our
opening
brief
at
page
54
quote,
“the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
a
nation
extends
to
ports,
harbors,
bays,
mouths
of
rivers
and
adjacent
parts
of
the
sea
enclosed
by
headlands.”
to
paraphrase
the
north
atlantic
coast
fisheries
arbitration
tribunal
in
1910
which
was
endeavoring
to
ascertain
the
meaning
of
the
terms
bays
in
the
treaty
of
1818
between
the
united
states
and
great
britain,
the
delegates
to
the
1849
california
constitutional
convention
did
probably
not
trouble
themselves
with
settled
theories
concerning
the
notion
of
bays.
they
most
probably
thought
that
everybody
would
know
what
was
a
bay
in
this
popular
sense
and
that
most
of
them
that
that's
the
way
the
term
must
be
interpreted
in
the
constitution
and
i
should
simply
note
in
passing
with
california's
constitution
in
1849
was
written
at
monterey
here
on
the
shores
of
monterey
bay.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
precisely
the
next
thing
i'll
turn
to
you.
now,
the
case
of
monterey
bay
was
the
first
bay
where
the
question
of
whether
it
was
a
bay
or
whether
it
came
within
the
boundaries
of
california
came
before
our
state
supreme
court
in
california.
actually,
there
was
a
prior
federal
case
with
the
principal
case
found
which
rely
is
the
case
of
ocean
industries
versus
the
superior
court
which
is
a
1927
california
supreme
court
case.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
the
question
arose
squarely
on
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
a
fish
reduction
plant
was
operating
out
in
monterey
bay,
a
floating
plant.
the
plant
was
operating
in
approximately
the
location
of
my
point.
in
other
words,
it
would
be
between
the
red
line
and
the
green
line.
the
question
was
raised
whether
or
not
the
plant
or
both
was
operating
in
territorial
waters
of
california
and
so
that
california
could
regulate
the
operation
of
the
plant.
in
other
words,
the
question
of
injunctive
relief
was
sought
to
stop
the
operation
of
this
fish
reduction
plant
under
our
fish
and
game
law.
the
contention
was
made
that
the
boat
was
operating
outside
of
the
territorial
or
the
inland
waters
of
california.
it
was
on
the
high
sea.
the
precise
portion
is
that
we
say
is
here.
the
court
has
said
in
that
case
clearly
the
description
bays
included
bays,
all
bays
in
the
ways
they
were
commonly
understood
at
that
time.
clearly
also,
historically,
under
spanish
and
mexican
rule
bays
were
considered
to
require
the
mainland
to
be
included
within
the
territory
of
the
state
of
california,
that
this
history
was
picked
up
by
california
at
the
time
that
it
became
a
state.
that
its
constitution
in
effect
picked
up
the
mexican
and
spanish
history
and
in
turn
this
was
the
way
the
constitution
was
to
be
interpreted
that
this
in
turn
was
binding
on
the
united
states
and
the
state
approved
the
admission
act
in
1850.
this
is
in
effect
is
the
chain
of
logic.
i
commend
to
you
--
the
court's
attention,
what
we
consider
the
excellent
discussion
of
this
question
in
the
ocean
industry's
case,
the
supreme
court
case.
this
reasoning
and
this
i
might
say
follows
in
turn
and
is
in
turn
dependent
upon
the
earlier
decisions
or
the
earlier
rulings
of
attorney
general
randolph
in
the
case
of
delaware
bay
and
in
the
commissioners
for
alabama
claims
in
the
chesapeake
bay
which
are
also
cited
in
our
brief.
now
we
say
those
are
--
these
cases
are
exactly
very
identical
in
logic
and
in
reason
to
those
earlier
cases.
we
also
say
that
this
is
the
exact
type
of
activity
by
the
state
that
senator
holland
meant
when
he
said
and
i
quote
from
the
hearings
at
page
48.
it
is
a
case
of
restoration
and
establishment
to
states
of
what
lies
within
their
boundaries
of
jurisdiction,
of
criminal
law
and
a
various
other
kinds
of
law.
also
of
significance
and
i
referred
as
the
earlier
chesapeake
and
delaware
cases.
we
have
the
same
situation
existing
with
respect
to
san
pedro
bay,
we
have
the
case
of
people
versus
carrillo
where
federal
judge
district
judge
stevens
would
have
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
particular
gambling
ship
was
operating
on
the
high
seas
or
within
inland
waters
to
the
state
of
california
when
it
was
operating
on
the
same
condition
of
property
on
one
point
that
was
here.
he
stated
again
that
the
--
looking
at
the
history
of
california,
the
spanish
and
mexican
period
and
looking
back
to
one
vancouver
first
discovered
this
bay,
the
san
pedro
bay
extended
from
this
point
here
over
to
point
lasuen.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that's
correct
sir
constitutionally.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
this
is
--
we
say
that
that
is
not
and
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
and
the
issues
before
here
that
this
is
not
before
this
court
that
this
boundary
as
far
as
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
the
subject,
if
i
may
say,
they
are
inland
waters
but
subject
as
the
submerged
lands
act
says
in
section
3
and
6
to
the
paramount
rights
of
the
united
states
in
foreign
relations.
this
portion
of
the
1947
california
decision
we
say
has
never
changed,
that
the
paramount
rights
still
exists
and
all
it
has
happened
has
been
that
with
respect
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
well,
the
prob
--
the
problem
we
say
is
partly
in
this
case
and
the
problem
determine
where
the
inland
waters
lie
in
a
place
such
as
this.
the
united
states
says
in
order
to
determine
those
inland
waters
you
have
to
look
to
international
criteria.
we
say
that
the
criteria
that
you
look
to
initially
are
the
constitution,
in
this
case
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
california,
the
terms
under
which
it
was
admitted
to
the
union
what
determines
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
i
say
that
you
can
do.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
we
say
that
not
only
did
congress
intend
that,
that
congress
could
not
under
cases
decided
by
this
court
do
anything
differently.
if
these
bays
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
well,
i'm
not
quite
sure
there
is
but
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
right.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
i
would
say
not
except
that
i
think
section
6
is
merely
an
expression
of
a
way
saying
that
these
paramount
rights
exists
whether
they're
over
land
or
whether
they're
over
water
in
effect.
i
would
say
yes.
i
would
agree
with
you.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
well,
i
think
somewhere
in
one
of
these
comments
in
the
discussion
in
the
debates
appears
a
statement
that
the
united
states
has
certain
powers
or
rights,
national
defense
would
have
certain
rights
over
property
on
land
as
well
as
on
sea
and
in
foreign
commerce
as
well.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
well,
fishing
rights
are
handled
separately
in
the
submerged
lands
act.
they
are
in
effect
--
the
states
are
allowed
to
make
limited
regulations
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
well,
they
would
be
under
the
control
of
the
sea.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
no
matter
what
your
constitution
says,
you
don't
have
to
--
even
if
constitutionally,
we
say
between
the
nation
and
the
states
these
are
the
boundaries.
the
foreign
nations
do
not
have
to
recognize
these
boundaries
except
in
so
far
as
we
may
have
arrived
in
an
international
convention
with
respect
to
determining
where
the
lines
lie.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
subject
to
the
foreign
--
to
the
foreign
relations
power
of
the
united
states,
yes.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes
--
yes.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
well
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that's
correct.
we
would
be.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that's
correct.
but
again
as
discussed
somewhere
in
these
debates
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes,
you
could
declare
the
waters
territorial
waters
in
which
case
--
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
yes,
i
would
say
so.
mr.
richard
h.
keatinge
now,
the
case
of
santa
monica
bay
is
similar
to
the
case
of
san
pedro
bay
and
the
case
of
the
people
versus
stralla
lays
down
what
we
think
a
sound
test
for
determining
whether
or
not
particular
bays
should
be
considered
as
bays.
and
this
court
says,
is
the
body
of
water
of
bay
geographically,
is
it
a
bay
historically,
and
is
it
a
bay
legally?
in
this
case,
the
court
answered
all
the
question
in
the
affirmative
and
this
was
again
a
question
of
criminal
jurisdiction
and
the
application
of
criminal
law
in
this
particular
area
of
the
bays.
now,
on
leaving
this
point,
i
would
like
to
call
the
courts
attention
to
the
fact
that
these
cases,
all
these
california
cases
are
tied
together
directly
to
the
early
1793
opinion
of
attorney
general
randolph
with
respect
for
delaware
bay
and
1882
opinion
of
the
commissioners
on
alabama
claims
with
respect
to
the
waters
of
chesapeake
bay.
and
we
further
believe
these
cases,
these
california
cases
are
among
the
cases
to
which
senators
holland,
cordon,
long,
and
anderson
referred
when
they
spoke
of
inland
waters
having
been
defined
by
the
courts.
we
say
that
the
congress
did
not
intend
to
adopt
any
technical
criteria
when
it
defined
the
coastline.
when
applied
to
the
california
coast,
the
submerged
lands
act
encompassed
the
historic
and
constitutional
boundary
of
state.
this
boundary
uses
the
term
bays.
it
must
be
concluded
that
congress
intended
that
as
to
california,
all
those
bodies
of
water
which
have
always
been
considered
bays
constitute
inland
waters
within
the
meaning
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
now,
returning
to
our
island
boundary,
historically
as
we
have
shown
in
our
briefs,
the
water
areas
between
the
mainland
and
the
southern
california
islands
were
subject
the
jurisdiction
of
spain
and
mexico.
the
california
supreme
court
in
the
ocean
industries
case
carefully
appraised
this
history
of
spanish
and
mexican
control
over
the
coast,
seas,
and
adjacent
islands,
and
the
court
pointed
out
that
this
area
of
jurisdiction
was
ceded
by
mexico
to
united
states
by
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
in
1848.
as
the
federal
court
noted
in
united
states
versus
carrillo,
this
area
became
part
of
california
under
the
constitution
of
1849.
we
also
contend
that
the
constitutional
boundary
description
was
provided
for
a
seaward
boundary
from
the
mexican
border
and
i
quote,
“running
in
the
northwesterly
direction
and
following
the
direction
of
the
pacific
coast,”
and
the
final
phrase,
“also
all
islands
along
and
adjacent
to
the
pacific
coast.”
in
light
of
the
history
of
the
area
means,
that
the
intervening
waters
are
part
of
california
and
are
inland
waters
within
the
meaning
purpose
intended
the
submerged
lands
act.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
these
phrases
were
selected
from
several
alternative
boundary
descriptions
and
then
a
total
context
of
the
history
of
the
area
and
intent
of
constitutional
convention
must
construed
as
we
contend.
the
united
states
insist
that
california
has
never
prior
to
this
case
claimed
jurisdiction
over
this
area.
we
point
out
that
the
special
master
noted
that
in
1939,
the
brief
of
the
state
of
california
filed
with
the
california
supreme
court
in
the
people
versus
stralla,
asserted
that
the
water
area
lying
easterly
of
the
islands
is
within
the
boundaries
of
the
state
of
california
as
appears
to
the
master's
report
at
page
37.
of
course,
the
court
in
that
case
was
concerned
with
santa
monica
bay
and
not
the
overall
unit,
so
was
not
required
to
rule
on
the
assertion.
the
court
did
however
rule
and
i
quote
in
14
cal.2d
at
633
“that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
extends
over
the
waters
of
santa
monica
bay
and
at
least
for
a
distance
of
three
miles
oceanward
from
that
line.”
finally
in
our
closing
brief,
we
presented
an
analysis
of
the
federal
land
mass
which
were
published
in
1885
in
which
i
have
discussed
previously
which
we
also
say
are
consistent
with
california's
interpretation
of
its
constitutional
boundaries.
in
summary,
we
put
on
this
point
we
believe
that
historic
boundaries,
state
boundaries,
boundaries
of
county
jurisdiction
and
criminal
fish
jurisdiction
represent
the
factors
to
which
senator
holland
referred
and
which
must
be
considered
in
determining
whether
an
area
constitutes
inland
waters
within
the
meaning
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
