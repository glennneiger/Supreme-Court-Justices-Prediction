well,
i
haven't
--
in
haven't
finished
yet.
i
think
you'll
see
what
i
get
prove
my
argument,
its
not
circular
and
it's
right
to
the
point,
if
i
may
finish
it.
now,
we
say
that
chesapeake
and
delaware
bays
are
inland
waters
then
surely
the
bays
of
california
inland
waters,
irrespective
of
any
presently
used
technical
geographic
criteria.
now,
as
our
state's
supreme
courts
said
in
the
stralla
case
and
discussing
the
criteria
determining
what
are
inland
waters
and
i
quote,
the
of
14
cal.2d
631,
“the
usage
and
custom
appears
to
be
established
to
the
effect
that
when,
is
here,
the
facts
are
that
the
bay
is
not
and
cannot
become
a
pathway
between
nations
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
has
been
asserted
under
both
the
present
and
former
governments
that
has
been
recognized
as
a
bay
and
it's
a
harbor
within
the
territorial
boundaries
of
the
states
as
described
by
the
law
of
the
land.
the
courts
have
decided
in
accordance
with
the
jurisdictional
claim.”
california
believes
that
the
government
and
the
special
master
plays
an
unwarranted
strictness
and
burden
on
california
as
to
the
quantum
and
burden
on
california
as
to
the
quantum
and
quality
of
proof
required
to
established
california's
claims
and
particularly
the
bays
as
historic
waters.”
recently,
a
great
deal
of
study
has
been
given
to
the
doctrine
of
historic
waters
as
evidence
by
the
decision
of
the
international
court
of
justice
in
the
anglo-norwegian
fisheries
case,
the
two
un
monographs
which
are
referred
to
on
both
our
briefs
and
the
government's
briefs
and
recent
books
on
bays
by
international
law
scholars.
as
the
international
court
of
justice
said
in
the
anglo-norwegian
played
a
case,
historic
waters
should
be
defined
as
follows
and
i
quote
from
the
opinion
of
that
case
which
appears
on
the
reports
of
the
international
court
of
justice
at
page
116,
“by
historic
waters
are
usually
meant
waters
which
are
treated
as
internal
waters
but
which
would
not
have
that
character
where
it
not
for
the
existence
of
a
historic
title.”
the
beginning
point
of
an
analysis
to
this
doctrine
as
we
point
it
out
--
as
it
was
pointed
out
at
the
un
study,
the
recognition
that
the
doctrine
is
an
exception
to
other
geographic
criteria
for
delineating
inland
waters
but
it's
a
separate
method
of
delineation
of
equal
dignity.
and
this
is
extremely
important,
we
say,
to
geographic
criteria.
a
necessary
corollary
to
this
view
is
the
rejection
of
any
requirement
that
prescriptive
rights
are
titled
by
adverse
possession
must
be
established
in
order
to
qualify
an
area
as
historic
waters.
the
basic
requirement
is
the
peaceful
exercise
of
authority
without
any
foreign
interference
or
objection.
furthermore,
the
particular
facts
and
circumstances
of
each
area
must
be
examined
in
order
to
ascertain
whether
that
area
constitutes
historic
waters.
in
the
case
of
california's
bays,
our
briefs
are
set
forth
and
detail
a
long
recognition
of
the
status
of
each
bay
from
the
spanish
period
to
date.
we
point
out
that
our
constitution
included
all
bays
without
exception.
the
three
cases
without
hesitation
rely
on
the
constitution
as
well
as
on
the
spanish
and
mexican
history.
these
cases
do
not
rely
solely
as
was
indicated
by
the
government
on
acts
of
jurisdictions
such
as
fishing
regulation
but
each
delves
into
the
history
to
recognize
a
pre-existing
situation
and
recognition
of
a
particular
status
of
these
bays
in
california.
and
now,
we
come
to
what
i
think
is
the
probably
the
most
important
single
point
i
would
make
with
respect
to
the
government's
intention
in
this
area.
and
that
is
this,
that
each
of
these
cases
are
three
cases
on
bays
has
received
worldwide
publicity
and
recognition
and
continues
to
receive
such
recognition
in
the
most
recent
literature
and
the
subject
to
historic
waters.
we
have
cited
commanders'
stroll's
book
and
mr.
buschey's
book,
but
even
more
important
than
this
and
this
we
think
is
the
key.
two
of
these
cases,
ocean
industries
and
carrillo
were
cited
and
digested
in
the
state
department's
official
digest
of
international
law
by
mr.
hackwood.
this
is
noted
in
our
closing
brief
at
page
85,
note
55.
the
next
point
is
that
in
1950,
the
state
department
prepared
a
memorandum
which
is
called
the
“united
states
memorandum
on
the
regime
of
the
high
seas”.
this
was
annexed
to
a
note,
to
the
united
nations
dated
january
6,
1950.
it
appears
in
the
international
law
of
commissions
yearbook
for
1950,
volume
ii,
at
page
60;
it
is
cited
in
our
closing
brief
that
pages
39
and
40.
and
this
memorandum
was
published
by
the
un
and
later
cited
by
norway
to
the
international
court
on
the
fisheries
case.
and
the
importance
of
this
memorandum
is
that,
in
this
memorandum
prepared
by
the
state
department,
two
of
these
cases
which
the
government
is
now
objecting
were
cited
in
support
of
the
position
that
these
bays
were
in
fact
bays.
so
it's
our
position
that
in
1950,
when
the
government
is
now
trying
to
argue
here
with
a
couple
of
letters
which
we
say
we're
drafted
up
primarily
for
the
purposes
of
this
legislation
for
this
argument
of
this
case
that
these
bays
were
not
bays
at
the
same
time
they
were
telling
the
united
nations
with
the
purposes
of
the
international
relations
policy
that
this
bays
are
in
fact
bays.
and
i
invite
your
examination
to
this
memorandum
which
we
have
cited
because
we
say,
“it
shows
conclusively
as
of
this
time
as
to
what
the
international
relation's
position
of
the
united
states
as
to
these
bays
really
was,
not
what
they
say
it
is
now.
