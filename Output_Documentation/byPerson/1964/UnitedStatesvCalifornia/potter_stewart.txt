justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
it
was
your
position
that
the
submerged
lands
act
legislation
in
1953
made
the
master's
report
obsolete.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
your
position,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
certainly,
the
1953
legislation
explicitly
overruled
the
1947
decision
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
master's
report
was
supplemental
to
that
1947
decision.
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
the
green
line
depicts
what
the
government
says
should
be
the
line
and
is
that
just
three
miles
from
the
shoreline
about
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
just
three
miles
from
the
ordinary
low
--
water
mark.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
the
government
at
least
for
some
purposes
accepted
a
10-mile
bay.
well,
they
don't
accept
any
bay
unless
--
unless
it's
less
than
10
miles
between
the
headlands,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
so
this
--
so
this
green
line
represents
simply
a
three
miles
out
for
the
ordinary
low
water
mark.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
but
because
the
dotted
line
is
--
is
imaginary
line
between
the
two
points
of
the
headlands,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
little
confusing
at
first
because
of
the
chart
and
the
photograph
are
--
well,
the
photographs
change
now
but
they
were
reversed?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
the
inner
green
dotted
line,
the
one
closest
to
the
shoreline
is
a
man-made
breakwater.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
was
there
before
the
master's
report
so
there's
no
--
justice
potter
stewart
no
issue
as
to
what?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
government
does
accept
that
and
puts
its
claim
there
for
three
miles
out
from
the
--
from
that?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
line
between
headlands
is
more
than
24
miles,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
--
in
the
decision
you
spoke
of?
justice
potter
stewart
you
--
how
much
do
you
rely
on
this
new
24-mile
convention?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
is
a
matter
of
external
policy
of
international
relation?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
my
understanding.
justice
potter
stewart
who
--
who
published
these
maps?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
i've
seen
--
i've
seen
it.
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
suppose
for
example
that
we
know,
there
would
be
no
question
about
the
san
francisco
bay.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
i
suppose
without
--
that
the
government
would
concede
that
you
don't
begin
with
the
actual
land
shoreline
there
but
that
the
shoreline
begins
at
the
entrance
of
the
golden
gate.
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
government
doesn't
make
the
claim
that
the
coastline,
i
mean,
it
hasn't
necessarily
always
mean
the
land
mass,
nobody
makes
that
point,
am
i
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
that
language
comes
from
how
early
a
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
the
question
arise.
i
haven't
read
those
cases
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
did
the
issue
come
up?
justice
potter
stewart
you
might
be
inhibited
by
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
addition,
of
course,
something
likes
the
national
water
power
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
dominant
paramount
interest,
federal
interest
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
it
would
have
over
not
only
these
bays
but
the
mississippi
river
or
the
great
lakes.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
being
upheld
there
pending
the
decision
of
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
decided
by
the
district
court
and
it's
on
its
way
or
at
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
potter
stewart
undecided.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
little
subtle
i
mean
just
subtle.
justice
potter
stewart
i
can
understand
--
i
could
easily
understand
the
concept
of
a
dominant
servitude
or
paramount
interest
in
those
areas
by
external
to
the
united
states
policy
or
international
commerce
and
so
on
but
is
it
your
suggestion
that
the
united
states
by
executive
or
congressional
actions
could
just
say
california
should
have
no
jurisdiction
at
all
criminal
or
over
the
fisheries
or
over
anything
else
in
san
francisco
bay?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
yes.
i
suppose
then
we
--
so
i
should
put
the
qualification
so
long
as
it's
constitutional
but
that's
a
question
i
guess.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
their
line
in
1953
when
the
law
passed?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
talking
about
the
underlying
real
estate?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
sure
i
quite
follow
going
back
to
the
big
california,
the
dark
blue?
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
much
width
does
that
have
along
the
coastline?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
what's
the
light
blue
got?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
light
--
light
blue
now
i'm
talking
about
light
blue.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
why?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
said
the
dark
blue
was
three
miles.
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
i'm
color
blind.
is
this
black
or
dark
blue
along
here?
it
seems
to
be
a
dark
blue
segment?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see
that's
black
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
so
what
you
can
see
is
simply
three
miles
out
from
the
configuration
of
the
low
water
mark
--
mean
low
water
mark
of
the
coastline.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
oh.
justice
potter
stewart
a
little
bit
of
san
luis
obispo
bay.
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
there's
a
dark
blue
there,
unless
i
mean
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
--
and
then
now
around
these
islands
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
now
why
--
i
think
that
would
be
light
blue
but
perhaps
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
can
see
that
they
are
following
those
rules?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
other
thing
that
i
first
saw
was
dark
blue
is
black,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
at
that
time
you
mean
at
the
time
of
the
pollard
decision
or
--?
justice
potter
stewart
in
1950?
justice
potter
stewart
was
--
was
what?
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
i'm
completely
misunderstanding
what
you're
saying
because
i
must
be
because
that
was
all
decided
in
the
united
states
against
louisiana
that
it
was
then
conceded
that
if
three
miles
are
to
the
boundary
of
the
state
whichever
---
the
historic
boundaries
of
estate
whichever
it
was.
justice
potter
stewart
up
to
three
leagues
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
geographical
miles
what
we
used
to
call
sea
miles,
2000
yard
miles?
justice
potter
stewart
rather
than
1760
yard
mile?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
terminology
of
words,
i
had
understood
that
the
word
or
the
phrase
coastline
included
the
outer
limit
of
inland
waters
that
it
included
two
things,
the
mean
low
tide
of
the
shoreline
plus
the
outer
limit
of
inland
waters.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
mean
to
quibble
but
i
think
the
words
duly
come
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
exception
--
that's
the
kind
of
cases
that
did
arise,
isn't
that
true,
these
criminal
cases
and
control
over
the
fishing
operation
in
the
monterey
bay
and
so
on?
justice
potter
stewart
territorial
waters.
justice
potter
stewart
the
special
master's
report
had
already
been
made?
justice
potter
stewart
this
colloquy
could
be
understood
as
saying
no
more
and
no
less
than
what
the
special
master
had
decided.
justice
potter
stewart
but
senator
holland's
reply
to
senator
douglas'
inquiry
and
which
the
florida
senator
say
the
talk
about
california's
provable
claim
and
so
on
might
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
to
be
understood
just
in
the
context
of
what
the
special
master
had
decided,
that
the
special
master
had
decided
against
california.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
they
do
that
justice
brennan,
this
morning
are
already
mentioned
another
place
where
it's
relevant.
justice
potter
stewart
and
yes
--
when
it
is
regarded
where
the
international
rule
or
the
inland
rules
to
there
own
or
they
own.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
were
happy
with
the
master's
report
in
this
area
and
on
this
subject.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
right
now,
i
think
i'm
might
saying
that
foreign
shipping
--
foreign
vessels
have
a
right
of
vessel
passage
in
the
san
francisco
bay
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
california
could
keep
any
ships
out
of
san
francisco
bay?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
commerce
clause
or
the
international
or
all
the
power
in
international
relations
that
the
executive
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
question.
justice
potter
stewart
i
agree
with
you.
that
was
i
would
define.
justice
potter
stewart
now
i
have
to
ask
questions
because
i'm
already
confused
enough
to
that
but
are
all
of
these
islands
more
than
three
miles
away
from
the
coast?
justice
potter
stewart
much
more.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
--
if
an
island
where
within
three
miles
of
the
coast
and
where
would
the
inland
waters?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
just
go
ahead
in
mind
and
then
what?
and
then
what
would
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
ground
underneath
it
would
go
on
to
california,
you
concede
that?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
implicit
in
this
party
argument
is
that
this
is
a
decision
exclusively
for
the
united
states
to
make,
the
california
would
make.
justice
potter
stewart
california
can't
make
this.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
the
one
with
the
big
breakwater,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
used
to
be
a
big
naval
station,
out
in
california.
justice
potter
stewart
regardless
of
what
it
makes
any
of
these
bays.
justice
potter
stewart
i
wonder
if
we
attack
on
the
end
of
the
boundary
description
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
territorial
description
on
--.
justice
potter
stewart
so
its
--
i
wonder
if
a
part
of
the
five
boundary
or
part
of
an
included
territory.
that's
what
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
it's
added
to
meets
and
bounds
the
boundary
description.
justice
potter
stewart
california
on
that
order.
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
bays,
i
mean
properly
geographical
areas
covered
by
water
which
are
popularly
called
bay
which
are
not
inland
water.
justice
potter
stewart
inland
and
so
on.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
think
these
--
as
i
understood
the
government,
they
really
conceded
that
we
could
have
a
historic
bay
that
they
need
not
any
of
the
other
criteria
of
the
--
i
mean
the
water
bay.
justice
potter
stewart
the
fact
it
wasn't
an
historic
bay.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
dividing
the
--
dividing
up
the
real
estate
lying
under
historical
waters.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
don't
--
you
don't
ask
that
now
to
accept
your
baseline
theory
but
only
if
--
do
you
think
there's
anything
to
do
with
it
at
all
with
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
said
that
this
argument
is
one
that
you
should
have
a
right
to
make
for
the
master
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
not
recognized
them.
alright.
