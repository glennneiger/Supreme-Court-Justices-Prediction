mr.
archibald
cox
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
primary
effort
will
be
to
try
to
bring
into
some
kind
of
focus
the
scattered
and
often
very
complicated
and
technical
parts
of
this
case
because
i
think
once
sees
--
once
one
sees
the
relationship
of
the
parts
to
each
other
what
are
the
really
critical
issues
that
separate
themselves
out
to
a
considerable
extent
from
those
which
are
important
but
are
nonetheless
details
and
i
find
that
it's
most
convenient
if
i
may
to
go
back
to
the
point
of
beginning
so
that
we
may
at
least
see
how
we
got
where
we
are
today.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
can't.
i
will
indicate
the
main
issues
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
and
i
think
the
parts
will
hang
on
them.
there
are
so
many
issues
that
if
i
attempted
to
relate
them
would
be
like
giving
a
shopping
list.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
think
i
can
explain
the
main
issues
and
that's
really
what
i
wanted
to
try
to
do.
the
easiest
most
convenient
springboard
is
the
decision
of
this
court
in
united
states
versus
california
the
original
case
where
the
court
held
that
united
states
had
title
to
the
three-mile
strip
known
as
territorial
waters
or
the
marginal
sea.
it
also
determined
in
the
decree
entered
at
that
ruling
that
the
united
states
more
specifically
owned
the
three
or
had
proprietary
rights,
paramount
rights,
in
a
three-mile
strip
beginning
at
the
ordinary
low
water
mark
where
the
sea
meets
the
mainland
and
beginning
outside
of
inland
ones
waters.
those
two
components
of
course
make
up
what
we
now
call
the
coastline
and
what's
described
as
the
coastline
in
the
submerged
lands
act.
just
where
this
three-mile
strip
to
which
our
title
was
quiet
was
left
undefined
except
as
the
court
used
those
terms,
outer
limit
of
inland
waters
or
outside
inland
waters
and
ordinary
low
water.
but
now
the
consequences
of
course
of
that
was
that
the
farther
out
california
could
push
the
outer
limit
of
inland
waters
the
more
oil
she
would
get
to
put
it
specifically,
and
the
farther
in
we
could
push
them,
the
more
oil
we
would
get.
and
it's
not
surprising
that
under
those
circumstances
that
dispute
immediately
arose
as
to
where
--
as
to
what
was
meant
by
these
two
phrases.
even
the
ordinary
low
water
mark
gave
rise
to
a
dispute
and
was
even
more
dispute
about
what
is
the
outer
limit
of
inland
waters.
at
that
point,
the
case
was
referred
to
william
h.
davis,
a
special
master.
there
were
a
series
of
motions
in
the
court
and
as
the
issues
ultimately
took
form
there
was
submitted
to
him
seven
representative
segments
and
he
was
instructed
to
determine
whether
the
waters
of
those
segments
were
inland
waters
or
not
inland
waters
and
to
lay
down
general
criterion,
the
general
criteria
by
which
he
judged
those
specific
illustration
and
which
it
was
contemplated
could
then
be
used
for
the
rest
of
the
california
coast.
in
addition,
he
was
to
set
forth
the
criteria
for
the
determining
what
was
the
ordinary
low
water
mark
on
the
shore.
he
made
a
report
in
1952
that
the
late
‘51
or
‘52,
in
which
he
determined
that
virtually
all
the
disputed
areas
were
not
inland
waters.
in
other
words,
the
report
was
overwhelmingly
in
favor
of
the
united
states.
at
this
point,
congress
enacted
the
submerged
lands
act
just
very
shortly
later
and
gave
to
the
states,
i'm
speaking
generally
and
not
attempting
to
beg
any
of
the
questions,
gave
to
the
state
at
least
the
three-mile
strip
beyond
the
coastline.
and
as
a
practical
matter
and
this
is
the
answer
--
part
of
the
answer
to
the
court's
question
why
the
delay,
as
a
practical
matter
at
that
stage
that
gave
all
the
oil
and
the
royalties
to
california.
this
is
very
deep
water
off
the
coast
there
and
the
methods
of
drilling
at
that
time
was
taking
course
of
getting
oil
did
not
permit
or
at
least
did
not
make
it
economically
feasible
to
drill
farther
down
and
so
that
nobody
was
really
interested
in
determining
as
i
understand
it
i
wasn't
here,
what
was
the
limit
of
inland
waters
or
what
was
the
limit,
if
i
may
put
it
that
way,
of
the
three-mile
strip?
there
were
other
reasons,
i
think,
that
explains
the
delay.
i'm
told
one
of
them
was
the
case
was
here
and
exceptions
before
the
court
and
the
number
of
lawyers
handling
it
assumes
that
the
next
move
was
the
courts
and
now
that
hardly
explain
to
full
10
years
but
i
think
it
enters
into
it.
there
were
conversations
between
california
and
the
federal
officials
which
are
related
in
some
detail
in
papers
attached
to
our
supplemental
complaint.
we
put
some
what
different
interpretations
on
them
but
at
least
they
show
that
there
was
a
talk
and
i
suspect
that
that
talk
catch
up
on
that.
perhaps,
these
are
also
matters
that
are
intensely
complicated
and
just
the
time
went
by
in
doing
anything
about
it
when
there
was
no
urgency.
now,
i
might
at
this
point
answer
one
other
question
that
i
think
justice
harlan
raised.
there
has
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
and
i
am
quite
sure
i
would
know
justice
harlan
there
has
been
no
problem
with
the
state
of
texas.
alright,
there
had
very
recently
been
some
problems
of
a
rather
different
character
but
some
prevalence
come
up
which
florida
and
the
united
states
are
currently
discussing.
they
have
arisen
very
recently.
so
far
as
louisiana
goes,
there
is
a
very
real
problem
and
there
is
an
enormous
amount
of
some
amount
of
money
tied
up
in
escrow.
we
have
been
discussing
this
actively
at
least
for
the
last
4
years.
what
the
next
step
will
be
i'm
not
able
to
say.
so
far
as
alaska
is
concerned,
the
problem
has
forgotten
to
take
shape
as
a
result
of
disability
to
drill
in
deeper
water
and
you
have
heard
reference
to
one
case
which
insisted
should
be
brought
in
the
district
court
rather
than
here
just
to
see
if
we
couldn't
get
some
of
the
things
settled
before
troubling
this
party.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
they
are
--
they
are
optimistic
enough.
yes,
this
has
become
real.
there
are
companies
that
would
like
to
bid
now
in
the
area
which
is,
will
be
determined
by
this
dispute
and
indeed
i
believe
there
are
a
few
course
that
have
been
taken
under
license
from
california
under
what
we
claim
is
our
land.
but
that's
--
i
don't
think
that's
a
serious
problem
it
is
something
that
we
want
to
open
up
and
there
are
several
oil
companies
that
are
definitely
interested
in
it.
that
of
course
is
what
brought
the
thing
go
ahead
otherwise
it
was
just
a
water
of
flotsam
and
jetsam
at
most.
mr.
archibald
cox
they
are
very
closely
related.
that's
all.
mr.
archibald
cox
some
of
the
rulings
that
the
court
might
make
here
would
seem
to
give
us
some
principles
for
the
louisiana
case.
also,
there
are
argument
as
presented
to
me
and
i've
been
conducting
the
negotiations
with
them
has
rested
on
primarily
on
rather
different
principles
that
i
understood
mr.
keatinge
directs
primarily.
of
course,
everybody
rests
on
anything
you
can
find
but
it
will
help
clarify
it
i
should
think.
now,
the
enactment
of
the
submerged
lands
act,
under
the
theory
of
the
united
states
is
what
the
submerged
lands
act
did
was
convey
to
the
state
title
to
this
three-mile
belt,
did
not
really
change
the
essential
issue
between
the
united
states
and
california
as
we
saw
it
and
i
just
want
to
explain
what
our
theory
was
without
arguing
at
this
point,
as
we
saw
it,
the
outer
limit
of
inland
waters,
i'll
forget
the
ordinary
low
water
mark
from
now
on
the
outer
limit
of
inland
waters
previously
marked
the
division
between
california's
property
and
our
property.
after
the
submerged
lands
act
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right
the
underlying
real.
after
the
submerged
lands
act
was
passed,
california
owned
on
both
sides
of
the
outer
limit
of
inland
waters
and
the
question
and
that
line
the
outer
limit
of
inland
waters
but
can
the
baseline
from
which
you
measured
three
miles
but
there
was
no
dispute
about
measuring
the
three
miles
and
the
question
as
we
saw
it
still
was
where
is
this
outer
limit
of
inland
water
is
located.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
part
of
the
coastline.
the
definition
of
coastline
is
made
up
of
the
two
components
outer
limit
of
inland
waters
and
ordinary
low
water.
since
that
was
our
theory,
we
filed
a
supplemental
complaint
thinking
that
the
special
master's
report
was
still
relevant
that
the
evidence
was
the
issue
on
the
point
and
that
the
case
was
ready
to
go
forward,
and
while
i
assume
this
court
didn't
make
a
final
determination
on
any
of
those
legal
issues
at
least
thought
it
was
enough
to
it
to
prevent
us
to
go
forward.
and
then
no
exceptions
were
filed
to
the
special
master
--
master's
report
and
that
brought
us
here.
now,
to
my
simple
mind
in
thinking
about
the
areas
of
dispute,
i
found
it
best
to
start
with
the
map
of
california
instead
of
all
these
details
and
i
could
find
out
where
what
we're
talking
about
was
located.
and
we
have
set
forth
on
these
colored
maps
that
i
have
asked
the
clerk
to
distribute,
a
map
which
indicates
in
very
general
terms
what
is
involved
actually
here
and
what
it
means
by
way
of
principle
as
we
see
it
with
respect
to
other
the
parts
of
the
coast.
now,
the
areas
that
we
concede
clearly
belonged
to
california
and
so
stated
in
this
litigation
are
in
the
heavy
dark
blue.
in
other
words
san
francisco
bay
which
is
clearly
a
bay
for
any
number
of
reasons
in
international
law
what
is
the
two
miles
or
something
at
the
golden
gate,
san
diego
bay
which
is
way
down
the
lower
right
hand
corner
a
three
it's
not
marked
but
it
is
you
see
there
is
a
heavy
blue
line
down
there
the
very
limit.
and
then
a
three-mile
strip
along
the
coast
and
around
each
island
separately.
we
agreed
that
the
heavy
blue
lines
along
the
california.
the
light
blue
line
running
up
along
the
northern
coast
is
what
we
would
say
clearly
that
will
go
to
california
under
the
principles
we
advocate,
that
again
is
a
three-mile
strip
following
the
sinuosities
of
the
coast.
what
california
claims
in
this
litigation
is
set
forth
in
the
heavy
river?
you'll
note
up
at
the
top
of
the
map
is
crescent
city
bay
which
you
will
see
mentioned
in
the
master's
report
and
discussed
some
in
the
briefs.
actually
there
is
no
longer
any
argument
about
crescent
city
bay,
we
may
disagree
as
to
the
reasons
but
we're
pretty
well
agreed
as
the
area
they
can
get
and
i
don't
think
anyone
suggests
that
court
need
to
worry
about
crescent
city
bay
even
though
it
was
one
of
the
segments
coming
on
down
you'll
find
the
monterey
bay
just
below
the
middle
of
the
map.
then
one
comes
down
to
san
luis
obispo
bay
which
one
of
the
segments
and
finally
to
the
so-called
“overall
unit”,
that
the
california
briefs
talk
about
which
i
will
describe
as
the
area
south
of
point
conception
and
with
respect
to
which
california
has
a
number
of
claims.
those
other
claims
of
california
are
shown
on
the
blanket
pipe
map
that
i
asked
to
have
distributed
which
has
taken
one
of
their
exhibits.
i'm
not
going
to
trouble
the
court
to
go
into
those
details
now
there
are
a
number
of
receding
claims
that
california
makes
and
we
will
have
to
go
through
them
later.
but
so
far
as
the
overall
case
goes,
i
think
for
the
moment
we
can
just
say
there
is
this
overall
unit
south
of
point
conception.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
what
we
say
belongs
to
california?
mr.
archibald
cox
three
miles.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
light
blue
is
simply
this.
you
see
the
case
has
not
this
far
had
brought
to
at
issue
the
whole
coast.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
light
blue
represents
simply
my
and
not
california's
--
my
projection
of
what
i
think
some
of
california's
claims
would
lead
to.
it's
in
other
words
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh!
i'm
--
that's
light
pink.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
sorry.
light
pink.
light
blue
is
what
we
with
the
wave
of
our
hands
they
belong
to
california.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
has
the
three-mile
strip.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
is
too.
you'll
note
that
they
don't
--
they
just
applied
to
different
segments
in
the
codes.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
no.
that's
the
--
that's
the
black
line
of
low
water
mark,
justice
stewart.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
san
francisco
bay.
mr.
archibald
cox
quite
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right.
some
of
the
--
they
could
claim
we
--
that
this
is
just
an
effort
to
give
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
that's
why
there's
the
light
pink
there
because
that
shows
what
we
think
they
would
like.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
justice
stewart,
let
me
see
if
i
can.
there
is
no
dark
blue
line
between
monterey
bay
and
san
luis
obispo
bay.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
black.
mr.
archibald
cox
plus
san
francisco
bay
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
san
diego
bay
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
crescent
city
bay
--
mr.
archibald
cox
and
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
archibald
cox
none
have
said
but
a
little
bit
of
san
pedro
bay.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'm
afraid
that
is
a
blurring
--
well,
it
may
be
i'm
told
there
may
be
a
bit
up
there.
mr.
archibald
cox
three
miles.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
because
the
islands
--
well,
i
thought
this
would
be
helpful
i'm
beginning
to
think
it's
the
reverse.
the
light
blue,
the
dark
blue
is
defined
to
the
matters
that
have
been
specifically
mentioned
thus
far
in
these
proceedings
either
before
the
master
wrote
here.
the
light
blue
is
simply
a
projection
of
the
rule.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right
i
see.
another
reason
san
francisco
bay
and
san
diego
bay
are
mentioned
is
because
of
whether
there's
the
specific
stipulation
about
it
which
we
hope
the
court
would
someday
file.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
now,
i
would
like
to
come
to
a
specific
legal
starting
point
as
we
see
it
or
perhaps
to
set
the
basic
framework
of
the
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
shall.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
they
did
--
it
is
purely
illustrated
with
some
of
the
application
of
the
rules
for
which
california
contends,
i
will
mention
it
when
i
come
the
specific
rules.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
that's
one
of
the
principles
that
california
relies
on.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
they
may
have
some
other
theories
but
that's
all
this
illustrates.
california's
title
must
come
as
i
see
it
from
one
of
two
sources.
either
it
must
come
from
the
role
of
the
pollard
and
hagan.
substantially
unaffected
by
the
submerged
lands
act
or
it
must
be
derived
from
the
submerged
lands
act.
now,
so
far
if
we
take
the
first
possibility
coming
form
pollard
and
hagan
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
before
the
court
now
is
identical,
indisputably
identical,
with
the
questions
before
the
special
master.
in
other
words,
the
question
would
be
how
much
of
these
waters
was
inland
waters
and
california
to
get
the
disputed
area
must
show
that
everything
within
three
miles
of
it
was
inland
waters?
by
inland
waters,
at
that
time,
it
was
understood
to
me
the
area
over
which
of
the
literal
nation
claims
the
same
sovereignty
and
it
would
claim
over
land
areas
same
exclusive
sovereignty
over
it
as
against
foreign
nations.
and
this
was
--
mr.
archibald
cox
at
the
time
--
no
when
it
was
before
the
special
master.
it
was
agreed
then
that
that's
what
the
impression
meant.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
it
contrasts
the
phrase
inland
waters
with
the
term
territorial
sea
which
applies
to
a
three-mile
outside
inland
waters
and
which
differs
chiefly
in
the
merchant
vessels
of
foreign
nations
have
a
right
of
innocent
passage
over
the
three-mile
strip,
the
territorial
sea
or
the
marginal
sea
which
they
don't
have
inland
waters.
in
other
respects,
they're
substantially
the
same.
indeed,
i
would
be
hard
put
to
it
to
name
any
other
respect
in
which
they
differ.
these
questions
i
suggest
are
unaffected
by
the
submerged
lands
act
in
any
way.
now,
the
second
source
of
california's
title
as
she
claims
it
may
be
or
is
under
the
submerged
lands
act
and
as
i
said
a
moment
ago
even
under
the
--or
as
i'm
about
to
argue,
even
under
the
submerged
lands
act,
california's
whole
claim
to
anything
beyond
the
three-mile
belt
depends
on
pushing
out
the
line
of
inland
waters
and
by
showing
that
the
areas
previously
in
dispute
are
inland
waters
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
the
critical
question
in
those
words
as
we
see
it
even
under
the
submerged
lands
act
is,
what
is
the
meaning
of
inland
waters
in
that
statute
or
more
correctly
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
phrase,
the
seaward
limit
--
the
line
marking
the
seaward
limit
of
inland
waters
in
section
2
(c)
of
the
submerged
lands
act?
i'll
come
to
the
language
in
just
a
moment.
i
want
to
dwell
on
this
just
a
moment
because
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
california's
briefs
are
thoroughly
confused
the
issues.
sometimes
they
agree
that's
the
issue
and
other
times
they
seem
to
have
a
different
definition
of
the
issue
and
this
is
so
essential
to
our
whole
case
and
i
think
so
essential
to
an
accurate
analysis
of
the
case
that
i
want
to
stick
on
it
for
just
a
moment.
at
section
3
(a)
of
the
submerged
lands
act
which
is
printed
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
beginning
at
page
3
(a)
it's
probably
about
20
pages
from
the
end
of
the
brief.
it
follows
very
quickly
at
page
183.
section
3
(a)
conveys
and
confirms
to
the
states
title
to
and
ownership
of
the
lands
beneath
navigable
waters
within
the
boundaries
of
the
respective
states.
then
section
2
over
on
the
opposite
basic
case
defines
the
meaning
of
some
of
those
terms.
section
2
(a)
(2)
provides
that
the
lands
beneath
navigable
waters
means,
all
lands
permanently
or
periodically
covered
by
tidal
waters
up
to
but
not
above
the
land
of
mean
high
tide
and
seaward
to
a
line
three
geographical
miles
distant
from
the
coastline
of
each
such
state
and
to
the
boundary
line
of
each
such
state
where
in
any
case
such
boundary
as
it
existed
at
the
time
such
state
became
a
member
of
the
union
are
heretofore
approved
by
congress
extends
seaward
or
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
beyond
three
geographical
miles.
now,
califor
--
a
permissible
reading
of
that
would
be
that
the
line
goes
either
up
to
a
point
three
miles
distant
from
the
coastline
or
on
to
the
boundary
even
if
its
farther
away
or
i
presume
that
it
could
mean
that
the
stopping
point
was
within
both
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
i
would
if
--
was
within
both
means
that
you
couldn't
go
beyond
either
the
three-mile
line
nor
could
you
go
beyond
the
boundary
line.
the
alternative
reading
would
be
you
could
go
to
whichever
was
farther
out.
california
says
in
their
closing
brief,
it
is
clear
--
that's
on
page
11,
it
is
clear
that
section
2
(a)
(2)
restricted
the
maximum
area
of
submerged
lands
restored
to
this
date
to
those
situated,
“3
geographic
miles
distant
from
the
coastline.”
well,
we
have
no
trouble
with
that
reading.
i
do
emphasize,
however,
that
if
you
read
it
that
way
and
that
we
think
is
the
net
effect
for
another
reason,
that
if
you
read
it
that
way,
it
is
necessarily
a
limit
upon
historic
claims.
now,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
historic
claim
goes
farther
if
what
the
congress
confirmed
was
only,
was
limited
to
three
miles
seaward
from
the
coastline
and
this
must
be
kept
in
mind.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'm
--
but
that
was
because
in
louisiana
case
this
was
specific
reference
that
you
could
go
to
the
historic
boundary
up
to
three
leagues.
see
there's
another
section
of
the
act
that
is
applicable
to
the
gulf
that
says
you
can
go
up
to
three
leagues.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i'm
quite
prepared
justice
stewart
and
i
am
in
danger
of
misleading
the
court
here.
i'm
quite
prepared
to
assume
that
on
the
basis
of
what
i
have
read
california's
interpretation
is
wrong.
i'm
quite
prepared
to
assume
that
on
the
basis
what
i
have
read
thus
far,
i
could
read
some
more
that
it
could
be
read
either
way
and
would
be
a
debatable
question.
indeed,
the
fear
was
expressed
before
congress
and
maybe
that
somebody
would
read
this
as
permitting
you
to
go
to
historic
boundaries
without
limit
and
there
were
a
number
components
of
the
act
to
express
that
fear
and
as
a
result
there
that
was
put
on
by
amendment
rather
late
in
the
debate
on
the
act,
the
closing
part
of
section
2
(b)
down
at
the
bottom
of
2
(a)
of
my
appendix
which
says,
“but
in
no
event
shall
the
term
‘boundaries'
or
the
term
‘lands
beneath
navigable
waters'
be
interpreted
as
extending
from
the
coastline
more
than
three
geographical
miles
into
the
atlantic
ocean
or
the
pacific
ocean
or
more
than
three
marine
leagues
into
the
gulf
of
mexico.”
now
the
plain
meaning
of
that
is
that
the
historic
boundaries
are
cut
off
at
three
miles
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
general
tenure
or
three
leagues
in
the
gulf
but
in
any
even
that
it
is
a
limitation
upon
any
historic
claim.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
right
and
the
league
is
three-and-a-half
miles
or
is
it
not
three,
although,
i
felt
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
this
was
put
in
to
meet
the
danger
that
the
people
would
think
up
new
claims
to
historic
boundaries
to
extend
them
without
limit.
it
was
--
it
was
to
meet
the
argument
that
we
may
be
giving
anything
that
any
lawyer
may
come
along
and
later
claim
he
has
a
historic
basis
for
showing.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
then
that
brings
us
on
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that
brings
us
of
course
to
a
point
that
i
would
have
to
discuss
in
a
very
few
minutes
and
now
discuss
at
length
and
that
is
what
is
the
meaning
of
coastline
or
more
precisely
inland
waters
because
while
we
have
the
statute
in
front
of
us,
you'll
note
that
coastline
in
section
2
(b)
that
i
just
read
is
not
left
to
interpretation.
it
is
defined
over
on
the
next
page
in
the
next
subsection.
the
term
coastline
means
the
line
of
ordinary
low
water
along
that
portion
of
the
coast
which
is
in
direct
contact
with
the
open
sea
and
the
line
marking
the
seaward
limit
of
inland
waters.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
i
would
not
dispute
that
that
was
a
factor
that
your
honors
would
have
to
take
into
account
in
interpreting
inland
waters.
i
would
suggest
and
i'll
dwell
on
it
a
little
more
later
that
it
does,
it
has
the
effect
of
sort
of
taking
away
the
very
limit
that
had
just
been
put
on
by
the
closed
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
if
you
move
it
out
to
what
was
the
state's
historic
boundary
the
point
three
miles
from
there
will
never
cut
off
anything
that
could
be
claimed
as
part
of
any
historic
boundary.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
suggest
and
perhaps
i
can
deal
with
it
better
when
we
get
in
context.
i
suggest
that
the
critical
point
is
must
always
be
a
reference
back
to
what
is
within
three
miles
of
inland
waters.
mr.
archibald
cox
right.
well,
if
i
can
just
stem
us
that
for
now
i
would
be
quite
content
because
i
do
think
that
this
means
several
things.
it
means
that
the
historic
something
has
got
to
be
historic
inland
waters
and
not
a
historic
something
else.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
one
still
would
have
the
gap
as
to
whether
inland
waters
means
historic
boundary.
let
me
turn
--
let
me
outline
my
argument
beyond
this
point
because
it
brings
me
i
think
to
the
point
that
you're
referring
to
justice
white.
my
argument
now
proceeds
in
the
four
main
steps.
first,
directing
ourselves
to
the
meaning
of
inland
waters
in
the
submerged
lands
act,
the
outer
limit
of
inland
waters
which
we
say
must
be
the
point
of
reference
to
any
claim
based
on
the
submerged
lands
act.
we
say
first
that
the
congress
made
the
grant
in
terms
of
a
line
drawn
three
miles
from
the
coastline
and
the
seaward
limit
of
inland
waters
because
those
concepts
were
familiar
to
congress
at
the
time
it
enacted
the
statute
as
a
result
of
the
entire
litigation
over
the
title
short
while
and
because
they
were
the
terms
used
in
this
court's
decree
in
the
united
states
against
california.
in
other
words,
we
say
that
there
was
an
intention
to
refer
to
the
very
concept
that
had
been
used
in
the
argument
of
this
case.
now
i'm
just
outlining
these
points
for
the
moment.
i'll
go
on
and
try
to
demonstrate
them
later.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
shouldn't
have
used
the
conjunction
and
i
misspoke
myself.
outer
limit
of
inland
waters
is
part
of
the
coastline
your
honor
is
entirely
right
and
it
would
have
been
enough
for
me
to
say
coastline.
i
was
attempting
to
emphasize
outer
limit
of
inland
water
that
was
all.
mr.
archibald
cox
you're
quite
right,
you're
quite
right.
i
appreciate
it.
now,
our
second
part
having
shown
first
that
the
intent
was
to
refer
back
to
the
usage
previously
in
the
litigation.
our
second
point
is
to
show
that
inland
waters
as
used
in
this
court's
decision
and
in
the
decree
was
used
to
describe
those
areas
which
were
inland
waters
for
the
purposes
of
external
sovereignty
of
the
united
states
in
the
sense
that
the
united
states
would
or
could
exclude
all
nationals
of
foreign
nations.
now,
i
point
out
that
if
those
two
propositions
are
established
then
it
becomes
immaterial
whether
this
are
some
california
title
is
the
pollard
and
hagan
theory
or
is
the
submerged
lands
act
because
the
two
come
together
and
the
congress
used
the
term
inland
waters
in
the
same
sense
that,
we
say,
that
it
was
used
in
the
original
case
of
the
united
states
versus
california
and
we
go
on
to
discover
what
that
single
term
meant.
our
third
point
directing
ourselves
to
that
term,
what
will
be
that
the
state
department's
representations
as
to
the
rules
to
limiting
what
the
united
states
will
regard
as
inland
waters
for
the
purposes
of
external
sovereignty
are
conclusive
but
we
also
say
that
the
representations
made
in
this
case
by
the
state
department
printed
in
the
back
of
our
brief
do
in
fact
conform
to
what
have
historically
been
the
rules
applied
by
the
united
states
in
determining
what
are
inland
waters
for
the
purposes
of
the
external
sovereignty.
and
then
my
fourth
point
proceeding
on
from
those
will
be
that
as
the
special
master
for
the
most
part
found,
the
disputed
areas
are
not
inland
waters
under
the
rules
applied
by
the
united
states
in
the
conduct
of
its
external
relations
and
that
of
course
will
bring
me
to
the
specific
rules
that
applicable
to
the
detail
of
the
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
it
was
not.
it
was
--
i
will
show
in
a
moment.
i
think
i
can
show,
i
certainly
argue
that
it
was
used
deliberately
to
take
up
the
meaning
that
it
had
been
used
in
--
previously
in
the
litigation
between
the
united
states
and
california
and
in
the
other
decisions
of
this
court.
now,
i'm
going
to
try
to
develop
those
four
points
in
the
ordering
by
judge
stevens
and
our
first
point
as
i
say
is
that
inland
waters
is
used
in
section
2
(c)
of
the
submerged
land
act
in
defining
one
segment
of
coastline
in
the
same
sense
that
it
was
used
in
this
court's
prior
decision
and
in
the
decree
in
united
states
against
california.
first
i'd
like
to
say
just
a
word
about
whether
this
case
involves
a
question
of
domestic
or
international
law.
in
one
sense,
it
most
clearly
is
a
problem
of
domestic
law
as
this
court
held
in
united
states
against
louisiana.
i
take
it
if
congress
wants
to,
it
can
divide
up
as
mr.
keatinge
said
the
continental
shelf
as
between
the
united
states
and
the
states
in
anyway
wants
to.
i
can't
agree
that
it
has
hardly
a
ripple
on
our
international
relations
because
we
have
that
decision
cited
against
us
by
mexico
quite
often
but
it
certainly
is
within
the
power
of
congress
and
i'm
not
attempting
to
reargue
any
part
of
that
principle.
but
it
is
also
possible
for
congress
in
settling
a
domestic
question
to
refer,
the
reader
as
it
were,
to
concepts
from
other
areas
of
the
law.
i
find
it
helpful
here
to
think
of
the
problem
we
often
have
in
determining
what
is
the
federal
rule
applicable
say
to
a
question
of
interest
on
a
note
owing
the
united
states
that
the
federal
rule
is
the
law
of
whatever
state
you'll
have
to
be
in
for
many
purposes
and
so
here
congress
in
enacting
this
submerged
lands
act
could
refer
the
muslim
law
or
roman
civil
law
or
as
we
think
it
could
do
to
a
concept
that
had
meaning
in
international
law.
and
if
it
did
refer
to
that
concept,
which
of
course
i
had
to
demonstrate,
then
the
case
must
be
decided
in
terms
of
the
rules
that
apply
in
administering
that
concept
and
they
would
be
the
rules
of
international
law
being
used
for
a
domestic
purpose
and
as
if
they
were
domestic
law.
now,
we
say
there
are
four
reasons
for
concluding
that
the
term
inland
waters
is
used
in
section
2
(c)
of
the
submerged
lands
act
to
describe
those
waters
over
which
a
nation
asserts
in
its
international
relations
the
same
exclusive
sovereignty
that
it
would
assert
over
land
areas
in
contrast
with
territorial
waters
where
its
sovereignty
is
subject
to
some
limitations.
in
the
first
place,
this
was,
we
think,
the
only
normal
natural
use
of
the
term
inland
waters
in
1953.
the
place
where
called
concept
was
important,
except
for
a
few
insurance
policies
was
in
external
relations
and
it
had
almost
no
importance
in
terms
of
internal
relations.
furthermore,
by
1953,
the
rules
for
determining
what
were
inland
waters
as
a
matter
of
external
relation
what
were
fairly
well
known
although
not
crystallized
upon
all
points.
our
second
reason
is,
california
doesn't
offer
any
determinable
alternative
meaning
for
inland
waters.
i
have
not
seen
in
the
briefs
or
heard
here
anything
that
i
would
call
a
definition
of
inland
waters
but
she
does
say
that
inland
waters
are
those
areas
which
the
states
always
thought
were
inland
waters.
now,
with
due
regard
to
the
concept
of
the
state's
historic
boundaries
but
the
states
never
thought
in
terms
of
inland
waters.
remember
the
state's
historic
boundaries
extend
beyond
inland
waters.
they
extend
three
miles
out
to
the
limits
of
the
territorial
sea,
alright,
and
the
states
really
had
no
occasion
ever
to
think
in
terms
of
inland
waters.
unless
you
got
to
accept
as
you
might
get
a
question,
i
overstated
a
little
too
much,
except
as
you
might
get
a
question
of
why
there's
something
say
outside
of
one
of
these
claimed
bays
was
in
three
miles
of
the
closing
line.
then
she
would
have
to
think
about
whether
the
bay
was
inland
waters
but
apart
from
that
state
hardly
ever
thought
in
terms
of
inland
waters.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
but
well
--
she
had,
had
to
close
--
claims
at
these
areas
where
at
least
territorial.
mr.
archibald
cox
she
did
have
to
claim
and
the
parts
did
in
the
two
cases
did
reason
in
terms
of
whether
it
was
--
the
bay
that
was
inland
waters?
yes,
but
the
things
--
the
other
things
the
state
does
normally
aren't
in
those
terms.
our
third
point
and
much
the
most
important
reason
for
giving
the
term
the
inland
waters,
the
same
international
meaning
which
it
has
in
the
prior
decree
in
this
case
is
that
that
is
the
sense
in
which
the
term
was
consistently
used
in
all
discussions
of
the
ownership
of
submerged
lands
about
outside
and
inside
congress
up
through
the
enactment
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
in
the
original
case
in
the
complaint,
we
said
that
we
were
talking
about
the
area
outside
inland
waters
and
we
referred
to
them
in
terms
that
made
quite
clear
that
we
were
referring
to
international
concepts.
the
brief
even
explained
that
we
were
defining
inland,
using
inland
waters
as
a
term
that
was
important
in
our
international
relations
and
if
you
remember
the
opinion
the
court
frequently
uses
the
term
inland
waters.
in
the
course
of
an
opinion
which
was
reasoning
about
the
importance
of
the
three-mile
strip
in
terms
of
our
external
relations.
well,
now
if
the
critical
thing
with
our
external
relations
over
the
three-mile
strip
obviously
where
the
three-mile
strip
is,
is
equally
impart
in
terms
of
our
external
relations
because
you
do
things
to
people
at
places
without
doing
abstraction
and
the
final
decree
then
goes
ahead
and
uses
the
term
inland
waters
but
without
any
further
elaboration.
now,
the
case
went
back
to
the
special
master,
the
united
states,
california
and
the
special
master
all
agreed
that
the
term
without
any
argument,
that
the
term
inland
waters
was
used
in
the
sense
that
it
had
in
our
external
relations.
the
master
said
on
page
6
of
the
report,
“the
parties
agree
and
recognizing
that
the
determination
of
the
demarcation
line
which
inland
waters
end
in
the
marginal
sea
begins
also
determines
the
exterior
limit
of
the
marginal
belt.”
and
therefore
involves
a
question
of
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
as
against
foreign
nations
i.e.,
a
question
of
external
sovereignty
and
then
he
goes
on
to
talking
about
finding
answers
appropriate
answers
to
these
questions
of
external
sovereignty
so
that
at
least
in
the
discussion
in
the
case,
that
equally
in
the
other
cases,
the
louisiana
and
texas
cases
comparable
to
the
original
united
states
against
california,
inland
waters
was
used
by
everything
to
mean
the
concept
that
was
important
in
our
international
or
external
relations.
it
seems
to
me,
it's
just
a
matter
of
common
sense
if
we
had
no
other
evidence,
it
would
be
absurd
to
suppose
that
at
this
point
the
congress
suddenly
used
inland
waters
in
a
new
and
wholly
different
and
undefined
and
indeed
unexplained
sense
because
nobody
explained
what
he
meant
by
inland
waters
or
anything
different
that
had
been
meant
in
the
discussion
up
to
this
point
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
report
of
the
special
master
was
before
congress,
it
was
known
by
congress
i
think
it
was
even
credited
from
the
record
of
the
some
of
the
hearings
so
they
were
entirely
familiar
about
how
california
as
well
as
the
united
states
master
had
used
the
term
inland
water.
now,
it's
not
necessary
here
for
us
to
rely
on
speculation
or
common
sense
as
i
called
it
a
moment
ago
on
this
point,
the
legislative
history
shows
affirmatively
that
congress
used
the
words
coastline
and
the
segment
of
it
inland
waters
for
the
very
purpose
of
drawing
upon
the
concepts
embodied
in
the
court's
previous
rulings
and
i
rely
on
two
sorts
of
things
for
that.
at
first
there
are
many
specific
instances
of
that
usage
collected
on
page
18
of
california
closing
brief.
there,
she
refers
the
court
to
a
number
of
amendments
which
would
have
had
the
effect
of
restoring
to
the
gulf
states
so
much
of
their
area
as
went
out
three
miles
from
the
coastline.
these
were
amendments
offered
by
senator
anderson,
senator
lehman
and
the
group
of
senators
who
were
fighting
the
holland
bill
and
the
more
extensive
grants
to
the
element
they
went
through
and
of
course
they
were
trying
to
cut
back
the
gulf
states
which
were
claiming
out
three
leagues.
their
amendment
spoke
of
three
miles
from
the
coastline
and
they
explained
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
those
amendments
was
that
this
would
put
the
outer
limit
of
where
the
states
could
go
at
the
outer
limit
of
the
united
states
for
international
purposes.
now,
of
course
those
amendments
were
defeated
and
the
defeat
makes
it
quite
clear
as
this
court
held
in
united
states
against
louisiana
that
the
outer
limit
of
our
international
boundary
is
not
the
outer
limit
of
what
congress
might
give
or
might
have
given
or
in
that
case
did
give
the
state
but
the
defeat,
i
submit,
was
not
attributable
to
the
fact
that
these
amendments
used
inland
waters
are
coastline,
coastline
in
an
international
sense.
the
reason
they
were
defeated
was
because
they
took
away
six
miles
of
what
the
state
hope
to
get
and
that
was
certainly
reason
enough
for
defeating
those
amendments.
i
think
it's
most
implausible
just
it
follows
that
they
were
defeated
simply
because
they
used
coastline
plainly
in
the
sense
that
is
used
in
international
relations.
now,
the
intent
of
congress
is
revealed
even
more
clearly
in
the
discussions
concerning
proposals
to
define
inland
waters
with
greater
particularity.
one
proposal
of
which
was
offered
by
a
witness
before
the
senate
committee
and
which
is
referred
to
in
california's
brief
was
to
define
coastline
as
the
line
asserted
by
the
united
states
as
marking
the
seaward
limit
of
its
inland
waters
in
respect
to
estuaries,
parks,
harbors,
bays,
channels,
straits,
historic
bays,
sounds
or
other
bodies
of
water
along
the
coast.
there
was
a
lot
of
objection
to
that
proposal,
some
of
it
from
the
state
department
and
eventually
the
proposal
was
not
adopted
by
the
committee.
california
tells
us
that
this
was
a
done
as
senator
cordon
explained
because
we
might
be
putting
the
united
states
on
record
with
the
precedent
which
we
intended
to
apply
domestically
but
which
might
be
applied
internationally
but
as
you
take
the
trouble
to
check,
you
will
find
quotation
which
california
puts
an
immediate
juxtaposition
with
the
proposed
amendment
that
i
just
read
came
20
days
and
a
thousand
pages
later
in
the
course
of
the
hearings
and
that
the
point
to
which
senator
cordon
was
talking
was
something
quite
different.
he
was
talking
to
a
proposal
of
senator
long.
what
had
happened
was
this,
the
bill
had
originally
included
after
the
words
inland
waters
or
coastline
in
conjunction
with
them
a
string
of
words
straits,
parks,
harbors
and
so
on
and
so
forth
and
that
had
been
deleted.
senator
long
wanted
to
put
most
of
it
back
in.
senator
cordon
was
explaining
why
it
had
been
deleted
by
the
committee
and
why
he
was
opposing
senator
long's
desire
to
get
it
back
in.
his
desire
of
course
is
to
increase
his
claim
to
bays
and
help
louisiana
push
inland
waters
out
and
it
was
at
that
point
that
senator
cordon
said,
gave
this
explanation
and
he
also
said
it
was
not
the
chairman's
view
that
we
were
attempting
to
draw
a
line
to
limiting
inland
waters
but
that
we
were
using
a
term
that
is
well-known
in
the
law
and
is
defined
by
the
court
in
the
california
case,
i
assume.
so
quite
clear
that
he
wanted
to
take
the
same
simple
term
that
the
court
had
used
and
put
the
matter
down
where
the
courts
have
been
when
you
left
it
so
far
inland
waters
was
concerned.
this
becomes
even
clearer
if
you
read
the
committee
report.
the
question
of
what
the
committee
report
from
the
senate
said
the
question
of
what
constitutes
inland
waters
where
it
should
be
left
where
congress
finds
it
which
is
the
only
point
that
i'm
seeking
to
make
the
moment.
i'm
afraid
i'm
doing
this
in
a
very
pedestrian
way.
the
floor
discussions
then
even
make
that
clearer.
there
was
a
reference
on
the
floor
to
california's
claims
to
the
area
south
of
point
conception
which
is
this
whole
so-called
“overall
unit
area”
including
some
of
the
bays
and
i
suspect
that
it
was
a
reference
to
the
whole
case.
although,
it
wasn't
explicitly
so
if
they
knew
of
claims
south
of
point
conception
they
must
have
known
the
other.
as
senator
douglas
then
rose
and
passed
“whether
the
coastline
may
be
interpreted
as
being
the
outer
shores
of
islands
far
off
the
shores
of
the
mainland
as
california
has
been
claiming
under
a
state
statute
and
i
believe
before
the
master
and
chancery
of
the
supreme
court
in
which
event
boundaries
and
ownership
could
go
out
a
long
distance
from
the
continental
land
mass.”
senator
holland
then
replied,
“my
understanding
is
that
california
has
no
provable
case
beyond
three
miles
from
its
mainland
and
that
as
to
the
islands
its
provable
case
would
be
three
miles
around
each
of
the
islands.”
the
joint
resolution
simply
continues
the
outer
boundary
of
inland
waters
pursuant
to
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
already
made.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
yes.
it's
the
distance
for
example
on
my
map
you
would
see
point
conception,
well,
going
from
point
conception
down
to
the
islands
immediately
south
there's
a
rock,
richardson's
rock
21
miles
and
san
miguel
island
is
the
bigger
island
there
it's
24
miles
and
as
you
go
to
point
loma
which
is
the
very
end
of
my
map
way
down
the
right
hand
corner
out
to
san
clemente
island,
it's
56
miles
and
of
course
to
go
around
san
nicolas
which
is
the
southwest,
i
guess,
or
somewhat
more
west
and
southwest
island,
it
would
be,
well
it's
40
miles
from
san
clemente
island,
it
would
be
up
60
or
70
miles,
i
would
guess,
from
mainland
and
these
are
tremendous
deepwater
plied
on
occasion
as
i'll
point
out
later
by
ships
of
the
deepest
drafts.
now,
this
colloquy
went
on.
i'm
not
suggesting
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
this
legislative
history
shows
that
the
congress
intended
to
decide
the
issue
before
the
special
master
against
california.
i
don't
think
that
would
be
warranted.
i
think
it
shows
an
intention
to
leave
things
where
they
were.
in
other
words,
it
certainly
shows
no
intention
to
help
california
so
far
as
the
claim
about
where
the
outer
limit
of
inland
waters
is
concerned.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
special
master's
report
had
already
been
made
and
this
reference
to
which
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
absolutely
--
well,
i'm
not
even
contending
for
that
much.
i
contend
only,
i
don't
think
i
need
to
contend
for
that
much,
i
contend
only
that
the
senate
intended
to
leave
the
issues
between
california
and
the
united
states
that
were
before
the
special
master
and
this
court
exactly
where
it
found
them
and
let
those
issues
adjudicated
according
to
the
same
rules
for
determining
the
extent
of
inland
waters.
it
would
be
applicable
if
the
submerged
lands
act
had
never
been
passed.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
senator
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
he
says
quite
clearly
the
joint
resolution
simply
continues
the
outer
boundary
of
inland
waters
pursuant
to
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
already
made.
i
don't
think
he
--
then
he
goes
on
and
perhaps
speaks
to
this
point
that
i
was
trying
to
expound.
i
don't
want
to
seem
to
claim
more
than
the
record
will
warrant.
i
think
the
record
makes
it
unmistakably
clear
that
congress
wasn't
giving
anything
in
this
respect
that
it
was
continuing
the
status
quo
and
that
senator
holland,
justice
stewart
thought
that
california's
case
was
pretty
feeble.
and
he
says
that
in
effect
of
the
passage
a
little
further
on.
he
said
the
senator
for
florida
believes
that
the
laws
as
announced
over
and
over
again
by
the
supreme
court
as
to
the
limitation
of
inland
waters
are
sufficiently
fixed,
definite
and
certain
so
that
it
would
require
a
complete
cataclysmic
change
of
the
supreme
court's
philosophy
in
that
field
to
afford
any
hope
for
an
extension
of
the
boundaries
of
california
so
that
they
would
go
out
beyond
the
islands
as
to
all
areas
contained
in
an
outer
line
but
he
made
it
plain
that
if
the
court
wanted
to
make
it
complete
and
cataclysmic
change
he
wasn't
trying
to
shut
it
off.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
not
so
far
as
i
know.
he
does
refer
to
the
fact
the
case
was
before
the
special
master.
i
don't
recall
any
mention
of
his
knowing
what
the
master
had
reported.
they
did
have
it
in
front
of
them
mr.
justice.
it
was
all
printed.
now,
just
one
thing
more
on
this
point
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we
--
well,
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
by
basic
premise
you
mean
it
is
to
determine
in
the
framework
of
the
rules
applicable
to
determining
our
boundary
for
the
purposes
of
external
relations.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
answer
to
that
is
unequivocally
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
number
of
decisions
had
away
in
the
hearing
from
legislative
debate
of
doing
i
guess
they
sometimes
do
when
we
invoke
the
precedent
in
the
courtroom.
you
would
have
something
you
hope
to
put
your
anchor
down
to
pretty
soon
it
becomes
a
well
precedence
and
pretty
soon
it
becomes
uniform
authority.
there
aren't
any
such
decisions
as
that.
there
are
a
few
cases
referring
to
the
problem
but
then
there
is
very
clearly
justice
brennan
of
course
the
usage
in
united
states
against
california.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
he
was
then
referring
to
and
distinguishing
three
cases
of
which
he
said
did
not
represent
the
actual
state
of
the
law.
i
think
if
i
remember,
they're
on
the
right
hand
side
of
a
page
and
he
goes
on
down
and
he
refuses
to
follow
those.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
do.
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
--
i
think
that
quite
clearly,
the
term
inland
waters
it's
not
defined
there.
it
is
not
spelled
out
to
details
that
we
referred
to
but
i
think
quite
clearly
because
the
whole
opinion
was
in
terms
of
our
international
relations
and
external
sovereignty.
because
what
the
court
emphasizes
is
the
need
for
national
jurisdiction
over
territorial
sea
that
this
implies
that
the
line
between
the
territorial
sea
and
inland
waters
would
be
fixed
within
that
same
framework.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes!
i
think
that
and
i
also
point
out
justice
brennan
as
part
of
the
background
that
we
had
so
explained
in
our
brief
in
this
court
before
the
intention
was
written
that
was
the
way
we
were
using
inland
waters.
now,
of
course,
it's
not
conclusive
but
i
suggest
that
with
that
usage
in
the
brief
before
the
court's
opinion,
the
reason
for
tying
to
those
concepts
in
the
court's
opinion
at
the
unanimous
agreement
thereafter
never
any
debate
as
far
as
i
know
between
california
and
us
and
the
master
certainly
no
recorded
debate
that
pretty
conclusive
by
inference,
but
there
is
nothing
to
answer
the
question
directly,
there's
no
clear
definition
in
the
event.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
you
must
amend,
if
i
may
be
so
present
here
justice
black,
you
must
amend
something
more
than
that
because
the
boundary
of
the
state
as
set
forth
in
its
constitution
extended
three
miles
out.
so
you
could
--
i
think
you
could
not
have
meant
the
line
inland
waters
coincided
with
the
boundary
of
the
state.
i
really
don't
as
a
matter
of
logic.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
then
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
then
the
--
if
that
was
--
oh!
but
something
more
must
both
be
within
the
boundary
of
the
state
and
within
our
international
boundaries.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
there
might
--
there
were
some
places
along
the
california
coast
where
boundary
of
the
state
has
declared
in
her
constitution
was
three
miles
out
from
the
ordinary
low
water
mark,
there's
no
question
about
that
and
where
there's
no
--
none
of
these
complexities
about
bays
or
anything
else
just
off
the
coast
and
as
to
that
your
opinion,
i
suggest
it
very
clearly
holds
that
is
not
--
does
not
go
to
the
state
because
the
united
states
therefore
could
not
had
been
thought
of
as
inland
waters.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
right.
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
right.
no
and
i
agree
completely
with
that.
i
did
not
mean
to
suggest
anything
inconsistent
with
that.
you
did
use
the
word
inland
waters
as
if
the
meaning
of
the
term
inland
waters
indicated
to
us
on
how
we
should
go
about
finding
the
boundary.
but
after
all
inland
waters
is
in
the
decree,
as
if
it
had
some
fixed
something.and
my
suggestion
is,
it
will
depend
on
no
particular
passage.
and
my
suggestion
is
that
if
you
read
that
opinion,
the
whole
discussion
of
which
is
in
terms
of
the
international
relations
of
the
united
states
territorial
waters,
inland
waters,
concept
having
to
do
with
our
international
relations
that
it
must
have
meant
to
be
logical.
now,
the
only
thing
we
say
you
decided
and
that
is
you
decided
that
this
was
to
be
resolved
by
reference
to
the
rules
in
external
relations.
what
they
were?
how
they
would
work
out?
we
fully
agree
it
was
left
undecided
but
the
framework,
i
suggest,
was
fixed
and
was
understood
by
everybody
else
at
that
time
but
to
be
fixed
in
terms
of
the
concepts
of
international
relations.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
that's
really
all
i
meant
to
say.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
no.
i
didn't
mean
to.
i'm
afraid
i've
misled
your
honor.
to
decide
the
case
our
way,
we
say
that
you
don't
have
to
worry
now
as
to
whether
they
were
or
were
not
within
the
boundaries
of
the
state
in
1953
because
congress
gave
the
state
everything
out
to
three
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
give
one
short
answer
now.
we
don't
claim
that
congress
took
anything
away
from
california
by
the
submerged
land
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
don't
claim
that
anything
was
taken
but
it
implies
that
it
was
not
far
thereafter.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
conclusion
of
yesterday's
session,
justice
black
asked
several
questions
relating
to
the
power
of
the
united
states
to
change
the
boundaries
of
the
state
and
relating
to
the
relationship,
if
any,
between
the
political
boundaries
of
the
state
and
inland
waters
and
its
ownership
of
property.
and
i
thought
it
would
be
helpful
since
some
of
those
perhaps
go
to
assumptions
that
lay
behind
what
i
was
saying
that
i
failed
make
articulate
that
i
would
begin
this
morning
but
seeking
to
answer
what
i
understand
to
be
those
questions.
but
first
with
the
respect
to
the
constitutional
power
of
the
united
states,
once
a
state
is
admitted
as
a
member
of
the
union
then
its
political
boundaries
cannot
be
changed
by
congress
without
the
consent
of
the
state
except
conceivably
by
some
exercise
as
a
treaty
making
power
in
which
we
were
forced
to
see
property.
that
was
decided
or
stated
in
mississippi
against
louisiana,
202
u.s.
1
at
40,
i
was
then
speaking
of
political
boundary.
second,
congress
may
not
take
the
property
with
which
a
state
enters
the
union
except
perhaps
by
the
exercise
of
the
right
of
eminent
domain.
third,
we
assume
that
congress
may
not
be
what
children
use
to
call
indian
givers.
that
is
if
it
yields
property
to
the
state
with
no
strings
attached.
now,
we
take
it
but
it
may
not
take
that
property
back
except
by
an
exercise
of
the
power
of
eminent
domain.
it
seems
to
us
that
none
of
those
questions
are
involved
in
this
case
for
at
least
three
reasons.
but
first,
we
say
and
i
will
elaborate
fine
a
little
later,
that
california's
political
boundaries
never
did
include
and
do
not
include
the
areas
that
are
in
dispute.
and
second,
we
say
that
california's
inland
waters
never
included
at
the
areas
in
dispute
even
if
those
areas
were
within
her
political
boundaries.
in
other
words,
inland
waters
are
the
outer
limit
of
inland
waters
and
coast
line
are
not
synonyms
for
political
boundaries.
and
pollard
and
hagan,
the
right,
property
right
that
pollard
and
hagan
carried
to
the
property
under
inland
waters
did
not
carry
a
right
to
the
property
under
the
sea
all
the
way
out
to
the
political
boundaries.
consequently,
boundaries
as
i
say
do
not
necessarily
coincide
with
coast
line.
they
may
coincide.
the
boundaries
may
go
beyond
the
coast
line
and
it
is
possible
that
the
boundaries
limit
where
the
coast
line
may
be
but
that
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
now,
i
suggest
that
those
problems
are
necessarily
true.
both
ended
the
decision
in
the
united
states
against
california
and
under
the
submerged
lands
act,
but
first
as
united
states
v.
california.
in
that
case,
california's
political
boundaries
unquestionably
extended
three
miles
beyond
the
coast
line.
indeed,
california's
argument
as
stated
by
the
court
was
that
her
political
boundaries
as
she
was
admitted
to
the
union
extended
three
miles
from
the
coast
line
and
the
court
held
that
nevertheless
the
united
states
had
the
paramount
property
rights
in
the
three-mile
strip
and
so
that
it
cannot
thought,
have
thought
of
the
two
as
coinciding.
in
the
louisiana
case
that
followed
the
california
case,
the
court
said,
the
matter
of
state
boundaries
has
no
bearing
on
the
present
problem
because
--
and
indeed
in
the
texas
case
where
it
was
argued
with
texas
came
in
to
the
union
with
political
boundaries
as
the
result
of
a
treaty
going
beyond
the
three-mile
limit.
now,
the
court
said,
even
if
they
did,
texas
surrendered
whatever
ownership
she
had
had
out
to
her
political
boundary
and
came
in
with
any
rights
to
the
property
under
the
sea
limited
to
the
three-mile
strip.
and
i
think
that
the
second
texas
and
florida
cases
extending
the
grant
holding
that
the
grant
under
the
submerged
lands
act
went
out
to
the
political
boundaries
of
those
states
as
they
were
admitted
up
to
three
--
up
to
the
limit.
certainly,
it
did
not
hold
that
the
inland
waters
of
those
states
went
out
to
the
original
political
boundaries.
indeed,
the
decree
defines
it
all
in
terms
of
a
distance
from
inland
waters.
so
again,
they
couldn't
have
been
taken
to
be
co-extensive.
if
you
look
at
the
submerged
lands
act,
again,
it
seems
to
me
entirely
clear
that
congress
assumed
that
the
political
boundaries
and
the
coast
line,
which
of
course
includes
the
outer
limit
of
inland
water,
could
be
very
different
things
that
these
were
not
identical
concept
and
i
notice
last
night,
the
number
of
points
which
make
that
very
plain.
the
first
i
may
refer
to
the
text
to
the
statute
again
in
the
back
of
my
brief
on
page
2
a,
section
2
(a)
(2),
which
happens
to
fall
in
2
(a),
defines
lands
beneath
navigable
waters
to
mean
all
lands
permanently
or
periodically
covered
by
tidal
waters
up
to
but
not
above
the
line
of
mean
high
tide
and
seaward
to
a
line
three
geographical
miles
distant
from
the
coast
line
of
each
state,
there's
one
expression.
and
to
the
boundary
line
of
such
state,
there's
another
and
different
expression
where
in
any
case
such
boundary
had
existed
at
the
time
such
state
became
a
member
of
the
union
or
it's
heretofore
approved
by
congress,
extends
seaward
beyond
three
geographical
miles.
of
course,
that
means
three
geographical
miles
from
the
coastline.
so,
if
the
congress
must
have
thought
they
were
different.
again,
section
2
(b),
the
last
half
of
it,
“but
in
no
event
shall
the
term
'boundaries'
or
the
term
'lands
beneath
navigable
waters'
be
interpreted
as
extending
from
the
coast
line
more
than
three
geographical
miles
into
the
atlantic
or
the
pacific
or
more
than
three
marine
leagues
into
the
gulf.
well
now,
there
again,
you
find
the
two
expressions.
it's
all
the
more
important
to
this
case
because
this
was
put
in
as
a
limitation
against
an
anticipated
to
extraordinary
claim
as
to
where
the
political
boundaries
were
located.
and
of
course,
it
wouldn't
be
a
limitation,
if
coast
line
meant
political
boundaries.
you'd
be
defining
one
--
you'd
be
defining
the
limit
in
terms
of
the
very
thing
that
you
were
trying
to
cut
off,
then
again,
if
you
look
over
at
section
4
which
does
have
to
do
with
the
political
boundaries
of
the
state
rather
than
its
ownership
of
property.
now
first,
the
seaward
boundary
be
it
original
the
coastal
state
is
approved
at
three
miles.
then
any
state
admitted
subsequent
to
the
formation
of
the
union
which
is
not
already
done
so,
may
extend
its
seaward
boundaries
to
align
three
geographical
miles
from
the
coastline.
now,
the
point
is
the
same
when
i
was
trying
to
make
before
under
these
are
contrasting
usages
and
not
equivalents.
and
a
little
further
on,
it
speaks
of
its
doing
this
without
prejudice
to
its
claim,
if
any,
it
has,
that
its
boundaries
extend
beyond
that
line
which
is
a
line
three
miles
from
the
coast
line
and
therefore,
the
political
boundary
can't
be
conceived
of
as
being
the
same
thing
as
the
coast
line.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
what
it's
speaking
of
boundary,
it
means
political
boundary
quite
clearly.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
does
not
use
the
term
political
boundary.
it
uses
the
term
boundary
in
such
a
way
i
submit
as
to
make
it
clear
that
it
is
talking
about
political
boundary.
but
it
does
not
use
the
word
political
because
it
speaks
to
the
boundaries
as
which
it's
submitted.
and
indeed
that
of
course
was
the
whole
point
that
the
decision
in
the
united
states
against
california
said
that
ownership
and
political
boundaries
don't
go
together.
that
the
united
states
owns
thing
in
this
soil
that
are
within
the
political
boundaries
of
the
state
and
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
up
to
this
three
miles
from
the
coast
line
limit
to
restore
that
equivalence
of
political
boundaries
and
ownership
but
up
to
the
limit.
i
emphasize
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
it's
had
--
as
i
read
it,
it
had
several
consequences.
first
and
probably
the
most
important,
was
to
protect
the
gulf
states
which
we're
claiming
more
than
three
miles.
second,
i
think
that
as
you
read
the
whole
thing,
it
becomes
clear
that
this
section
is
talking
about
political
boundaries
and
not
about
ownership.
that
is
the
whole
sense
of
section
4
and
that
this
simply
says,
“well,
this
act
can't
affect
any
claim
to
wider
political
boundaries
that
the
state
may
have
had.”
and
it
--
that
seems
to
me
mr.
justice,
to
be
what
it
means
all
the
way
through.
furthermore,
even
if
i'm
wrong
in
that,
i
don't
think
i
am
but
assuming
that
i
am.
then
i
think
the
most
affect
that
it
can
be
given
is
that
this
is
part
of
the
purpose
of
leaving
some
things
where
they
found
them
and
leaving
the
question
of
what
inland
waters
is
for
example
where
they
found
it.
but
i
think
it
really
relates
only
to
political
boundaries.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
guess
not
expressly
sir,
no.
but
you
spoke
of
the
boundaries
that
which
she
had
been
admitted
and
you
said
that
they
did
not
fix
what
she
owned.
i
think
that's
quite
clear
from
--
indeed
that
was
the
holding
of
the
case
necessarily.
and
i
used
political
boundaries
in
an
effort
to
contrast
boundaries
as
it
was
there
used
with
ownership
of
property
which
is
a
--
it
was
held
in
that
case
to
be
an
entirely
different
question.
now,
the
third
reason
i
say
that
the
question
of
the
power
of
congress
to
cut
off
the
states
ownership
is
not
involved
in
this
case
is
simply
that
the
submerged
lands
act
does
not
purport
to
take
anything
away
from
the
states.
it
purports
it
can
grant
them
something.
it
purports
to
grab
them
the
ownership
of
the
submerged
lands
out
to
a
certain
limit
and
whether
their
boundaries
extend
beyond
that
limit
is
irrelevant
because
they
did
not
own
it
anyway.
even
so
they're
boundaries
did
extend
beyond
that
limit.
so,
that
brings
us
back
i
think
to
the
fundamental
question.
first,
as
i
sought
to
argue
yesterday,
the
case
turns
on
what
is
the
meaning
of
‘inland
waters'
in
the
submerged
lands
act
and
i
was
arguing,
indeed
i
spent
most
of
yesterday
arguing
the
next
point
and
that
is
that
the
term
‘inland
waters'
was
used
in
the
submerged
lands
act
to
carry
forward
this
status
quo
that
was
set.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes!
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right.
in
fact,
she
claims
everything
three
miles
shoreward
of
that
line.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
--
excuse
me,
i
misspoke
myself.
she
claims
everything
shoreward
of
a
line
thee
miles
seaward
of
that
line.
yes,
excuse
me.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
she
has
--
as
i
understand
it,
she
has
really
--
yes!
yes,
on
the
premise
of
their
inland
waters.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
no.
no
and
neither
does
california.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
no,
no.
we
think
that
those
statutes
do
had
one
purpose
and
only
one
purpose
and
that
is
to
indicate
where
the
inland
rules
applicable
to
vessels
control
and
where
the
international
ocean
rules
control.
mr.
archibald
cox
they're
just
traffic
roads
on
the
road
we
would
say.
now,
in
the
louisiana
case,
if
and
when
they
ever
get
here,
louisiana
will
contend.
it
relies
on
that
because
in
that
instance
it
happens
that
the
coast
guard
line
is
placed
way
out
in
the
gulf.
but
here,
it's
apparently
placed
way
in
and--
mr.
archibald
cox
and
that
--
that's
right.
and
of
course,
this
is
terribly
deep
water
and
ocean
ves
--
going
vessels
use.
now,
i
should
say
that
there
are
some
small
points
in
these
bays
that
we
would
agree
were
harbors.
for
example,
we
would
agree
that
up
if
you
can
remember
monterey
bay,
that's
not
on
this
map.
it's
sort
of
a
hooks
right,
comes
around
in
like
this
and
the
shore
comes
out,
so
this
way,
we
would
agree
that
these
little
points
up
here
are
harbors.
if
you've
been
to
monterey,
we
would
agree
that
the
area
in
which
you
see
in
fishing
vessels
anchored
and
up
there
at
the
docks
is
a
harbor.
there's
not
--
that's
not
being
argued
about
here.
but
we
can
see.
then
there
may
be
a
few
little
points
up
next
to
santa
barbara
that
comes
the
same
way
as
harbors
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we
don't
rely
on
them.
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
we
would
agree
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
you
may
--
and
we
would
agree
that
the
question
is
one
of
the
interpretation
of
the
phrase
‘inland
waters'
and
if
congress
wanted
to
give
all
this
away.
i
--
it
could
do
it.
we
think
it
didn't
do
it.
i
--
and
we
don't
think
somebody
raised
the
question
yesterday.
we
don't
think
there's
any
chance
they
will
in
this
instance
because
it's
quite
clear
what
they
thought
about
this
particular
claim.
now,
they
--
the
point
as
i
say,
i
was
trying
to
make
yesterday
on
the
basis
of
the
legislative
history
as
well
as
the
sense
of
the
statute
and
continuous
usage
all
up
to
that
point,
was
it
the
court
--
the
congress
used
‘inland
waters.
to
me
and
whatever
the
court
meant
and
whatever
it
had
meant
in
this
litigation
up
that
point.
there
is
one
argument
that
i
didn't
quite
get
to
that
bears
on
them
and
then
i'll
move
along.
california
says,
“well,
the
phrase
‘inland
waters'
is
somehow
to
be
equated
or
almost
equated
with
historic
boundaries.”
i'm
not
quite
sure
which
they
say.
because
there
were
many
expressions
in
congress
to
the
effect
that
the
purpose
of
this
submerged
lands
act
is
to
give
back
to
the
states
what
they'd
always
thought
they've
owned.
i
want
to
make
three
comments.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
boundaries
which
she
was
admitted,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
the
--
there
were
three
points.
on
the
first,
i
would
want
to
find
out
if
that
was
a
general
slogan
that
had
a
political
value.
we're
giving
back
to
people
what
they
always
thought
they
owned.
it
was
not
anything
that
was
used
to
precisely
to
the
extent
that
it
had
a
precise
meaning.
i
think
it
was
quite
clearly
not
related
to
specific
areas
but
related
to
a
theory
of
law,
the
theory
that
pollard
and
hagan
applied
within
the
--
to
the
three-mile
strip
within
territorial
waters.
although
it
also
related
to
a
theory
at
least
in
the
gulf
that
the
pollard
and
hagan
rule
applied
out
to
these
states
boundaries.
but
in
the
louisiana
case,
the
court
--
the
second
louisiana
case,
the
court
made
it
quite
clear
that
what
the
submerged
lands
act
was
doing
was
restoring
as
it
was
said
in
the
congress
a
relationship
between
territorial
waters
and
the
state's
ownership
property.
now,
the
second
thing
that
is
quite
clear
is
that
there
was
no
intent
to
give
every
coastal
state.
whatever
the
state's
lawyers
might
claim
that
it
could
show
that
the
state
had
once
thought
it
owned.
of
course,
that
was
the
result
in
the
louisiana
case.
louisiana
didn't
get
what
is
says
it
thought
it
owned.
it
also
was
made
quite
clear
in
the
colloquy
that
i
read
yesterday
between
senator
holland
and
senator
douglas
and
later
senator
holland
and
senator
kuchel
that
there
was
no
purpose
here
to
give
california
the
waters
of
this
overall
unit,
south
of
that
point
conception
that
that
was
being
left
there.
they
thought
it
was
a
pretty
bad
claim.
if
the
supreme
court
did
something
surprising
and
gave
it
to
california,
so
she
won
alright.
if
they
did
what
she
expected
in
california
laws
is
alright
and
there's
simply
no
purpose
to
change
the
situation.
and
finally,
this
clause
to
which
i've
referred
so
often,
the
final
clause
to
section
2
(b)
is
perfectly,
plainly
a
limitation
that
says
that
more
than
three-mile
--
you
don't
get
more
than
three
miles
from
the
coast
line
regardless
of
what
you
can
show
about
what
you
expected
your
boundaries
would
be.
and
the
history
shows
that
it
was
put
in
for
that
purpose
to
cut
off
any
claims
based
on
what
people
thought
their
boundaries
might
be.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
--
our
view
of
section
9,
mr.
justice,
i've
never
studied
it.
our
view
of
section
9
is
that
--
oh,
no,
i
don't
think
we
think
that
section
9
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
confirms
by
our
joint
based
on
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
i
confess
i
don't
look
that
but
my
quick
impression
is
that
you're
quite
right.
now,
my
second
main
point
as
i
stated
it
yesterday.
when
each
of
these
is
built
on
the
other,
they
aren't
all
reasons
why
i
should
win.
i've
got
to
make
each
proposition
as
i
go
along.
my
second
main
point
is
that
the
term
‘inland
waters'
as
used
in
prior
decisions,
specifically
united
states
of
california
but
also
the
texas
and
louisiana
case,
refers
to
the
waters
over
which
a
nation
asserts
exclusive
sovereignty
for
the
purposes
of
international
relations.
i
really
argued
this
point
yesterday
and
arguing
the
first
point.
we
think
that's
true
essentially
for
three
reasons.
the
first
that
inland
waters
and
coast
line
are
--
especially
inland
waters
is
a
term
which
has
meaning
in
international
relations.
that's
where
people
talk
about
it.
now,
the
only
other
place
i
know
where
they
talk
about
it
is
in
a
certain
number
of
insurance
policies
speak
of
inland
waters
and
i
can't
find
in
the
ordinary
places
of
looking
any
other
references
of
inland
waters.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true.
i
--
it
where
there
it
is
a
term
that
is
sort
of
defined
by
the
very
act
itself.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
but
it
may
be
one
or
two
others
but
i
think
it
my
clients
is
essentially
sound
that
it
is
an
external
relations
that
term
has
its
chief
usage.
the
section
--
second,
we
point
out
that
this
was
the
way
and
the
term
was
defined
in
the
briefs
in
the
original
california
case.
and
it
seems
to
us
for
the
reasons
i
stated
yesterday
to
be
the
way
the
term
it
was
used
to
the
opinion
in
the
california
case.
third,
we
emphasize
that
no
one
had
any
trouble
in
understanding
when
this
case
went
to
the
master,
that
that
was
the
way
the
term
was
used
in
the
opinion
in
the
california
case.
it
was
conceded
by
california
as
well
as
contended
by
the
united
states
and
held
by
the
master.
i
found
right
in
these
two
points,
the
--
if
i'm
right
in
the
first
point,
then
of
course,
the
masters
report
immediately
becomes
relevant
and
has
just
the
same
relevance
that
it
would
have
had
if
we
were
here
in
1953
or
1954
and
he
canvassed
all
these
issues
and
except
on
the
two
very
minor
points
resolved
them
in
favor
of
the
united
states
and
we
think
his
report
is
entitled
to
very
great
weight.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
should
think
that
--
i
don't
think
that
question
could
be
answered
exactly
at
this
time.
there
are
two
things
that
might
remain
to
be
done
by
a
master
but
nobody
can
say
now.
the
first
is
that
we
might
fall
into
dispute
with
california,
about
how
some
of
the
criteria
that
his
report
establishes
apply
to
other
sections
of
the
coast.
i
don't
foresee
that
happening
but
it
could
happen
or
there
could
be
section
which
conceivably
isn't
covered
by
any
of
the
criteria
that
he
laid
down.
second
i
suppose
it
is
possible,
although,
i
think
it's
unlikely
on
the
california
coast
that
we
could
get
over
--
get
into
a
dispute
over
question
or
fact
about
what
is
the
headland
at
some
point
or
how
do
the
tides
run
at
some
point
but
i
would
suppose
that
if
the
master's
report
--
the
master's
report
is
confirmed
or
confirmed
with
such
changes
as
the
correct
makes,
either
at
our
request
with
california
that
that
would
substantially
settle
this
dispute.
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
we
could
resolve
the
rest
among
ourselves.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
you
would
have
to
--
that's
part
of
the
master's
report.
you
would
have
to
resolve
that
question.
oh,
yes.
the
remain
--
they
remain
but
still
a
number
of
points.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
said
it
was
the
lower
low.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
excuse
me.
mr.
archibald
cox
wait
a
minute.
i'm
told
about
that
i'm
--
you're
confusing
that
as
even
further.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
are.
i
am
very
sorry
again.
i
knew
i
would
get
things
all
mixed
up
somewhere
on
this
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
that's
right.
it's
a
matter
of
going
back
over
records
to
averaging
out
the
records
for
18
1/2
years.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
should
--
i
just
can't
believe
but
the
difference
is
ever
going
to
turn
out
to
be
large
enough
so
that
we
at
california
can't
work
them
out.
if
we
can't,
i
would
think
it
would
be
a
job
for
our
master
but
i
would
hate
to
think
either
the
united
states
of
california
was,
you
know,
this
is
a
matter
of
a
few
feet
either
way
and
i
would
think
this
must
be
true
amongst
of
the
other
points.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
our
disagreement
was
about
the
artificial
structures.
we
now
agree
with
him
as
to
artificial
structures.
so
far
as
they
were
in
being
on
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
the
submerged
lands
act
that
we
do
still
disagree
as
to
the
future
whether
that
has
an
impractical
importance
is
a
question.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
would
that
that
it
was
unwise
to
determine
what
structures
can
be
built
in
terms
of
our
--
to
have
ourselves
which
interest
about
the
oil
enter
to
that
position
but
technically,
you're
right
of
course.
i'm
going
to
leave
those
points
including
the
lower
low
water
and
the
low
water
to
my
brief.
it
just
doesn't
seem
to
me
their
details
so
that
it's
worth
asking
of
course
all
i'm
here.
now,
the
mark
of
this
to
that
seems
fairly
--
i
can't
follow
them
myself.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
the
next
point
that
i
am
clear
on
justice
brennan
and
that
is
if
inland
waters
has
the
meaning,
we
contend,
to
which
that
it
refers
to
the
external
relations
of
the
united
states,
then
the
rules
governing
the
determination
of
what
are
inland
waters
for
the
purposes
of
international
relations
are
those
established
by
the
executive
branch.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
we
must
distinguish
--
i
think
we
must
distinguish
between
two
things.
i
would
not
assert
of
course
as
a
matter
of
international
law
that
the
secretary
of
the
state
may
make
inland
waters
anything
he
wants
to
make
inland
waters
for
international
purpose.
indeed,
as
we
conceive
it,
the
whole
function
of
the
rules
of
international
law
is
to
set
a
limit
on
what
the
states
may
claim.
a
state
may
not
claim
everything
that
it
can
claim
as
a
matter
of
international
law.
in
terms
of
what
this
court
would
do
in
domestic
litigation,
i
should
think
that
if
it
were
the
set
policy
of
the
executive
branch
to
say
that
the
water's
halfway
out
in
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
where
part
of
the
territory
of
the
united
states.
then
this
court
would
not
go
behind
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
the
reverse
of
that
i
could
reach
my
case
on.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
that
if
the
executive
branch
said
that
canada
was
part
of
the
united
states,
that
in
domestic
litigation,
if
executive
branch
had
rarely
said
that
and
had
acted
that
way.
i
would
think
that
this
court
would
consider
itself
bound
by
the
determination
of
the
executive
branch.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
don't
understand
that
that
would
be
the
consequence
of
it
all.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
say
that
if
the
executive
branch
made
this
determination
in
the
conduct
of
international
relations
and
then
acted
on
it
in
the
conduct
of
international
relation,
not
just
for
the
purposes
of
litigation
that
it
creates
other
nations
in
that
respect.
then
i
would
say
in
any
reasonable
case,
i'm
always
a
little
worried
about
these
extreme
cases
but
then
in
any
reasonable
case,
this
court
would
not
go
behind
that
determination.
i
think
this
is
very
clear
mr.
justice
on
the
authority.
for
example,
the
first
case
in
which
this
came
up.
you
will
recall
that
we
--
that
there
was
a
considerable
dispute
after
the
louisiana
purchased
as
to
whether
the
united
states
obtained
the
territory
between
the
iberville
and
perdita
roberts.
i
am
--
whether
it
had
became
a
question
in
domestic
litigation
over
titles
and
the
court
said
that
the
position
of
the
state
department,
the
chief
executive
and
the
congress
on
then,
it's
simply
would
accept
and
they
had
said
that
we
did
get
the
territory,
that
was
the
end
of
it.
in
j.
jones
against
the
united
states,
it
was
a
question
whether
navassa
island
was
part
of
the
united
states
and
the
court
said,
it's
been
determined
by
the
executive
branch
and
congress
that
this
is
part
of
the
united
states
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
the
reverse
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
san
francisco
bay
is
for
international
purposes.
clearly,
inland
waters
of
the
united
states.
there
are
no
claims
more
that
we
would
take.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
but
if
we've
done
it,
you
mean
can
we
get
rid
of
it?
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
no,
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
that
--
no.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
unites
states
can
say
that
international
relations
required
us
to
deprive
california
or
something.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
no,
no.
(inaudible)
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
then
when
we
get
a
question
as
to
whether
california's
power
was
preempted
by
federal
regulation
under
the
commerce
clause
but
it
would
not
be
because
of
the
status
of
the
bay
in
international
law.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
but
that
was
the
equally
true
of
monterey
peninsula.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
it
doesn't
--
it
is
unrelated
to
the
question
--
mr.
archibald
cox
to
the
question
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
as
you
remember
first
thing
this
morning,
i've
stated
that
there
might
be
some
constitutional
questions
on
rolling
back
and
what
i
have
last
said
was
intended
to
be
subject
to
those
questions.
but
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
there
is
no
problem.
there
is
no
problem
in
this
case
of
rolling
back.
there's
--
there's
no
suggestion
that
any
things
been
rolled
back
whether
with
respect
to
the
property
rights
of
the
state.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
there
be
a
question,
there's
one
detail
that
i
think
would
come
up
better
in
its
place
as
to
whether
the
change
in
the
international
boundary
results
in
a
change
of
ownership
as
between
the
state
and
the
united
states
because
this
case
has,
what
i
regard
is
the
most
troublesome
point
in
our
case.
he
said
after
a
little
abasins
to
california,
so
as
not
to
get
cross
lies
with
their
argument,
he
said,
“with
my
real
case
is
this,
i
agree
that
inland
waters
is
a
matter
of
external
policy.”
and
i
say,
that
when
the
inland
waters
are
extended
by
action
of
the
united
states,
the
state
boundaries
brings
out
along
with
it.
that
of
course
--
that
argument
of
course
accepts,
i'm
sure
but
it
pays
would
agree
with
this,
except
all
the
premises
that
i
have
been
trying
to
establish
including
the
premise,
indeed,
i
just
see
relies
on
the
premise
i'm
now
trying
to
make
that
the
court
will
be
guided
by
the
determination
of
the
other
branches
of
the
government
as
to
what
is
the
territory
of
the
united
states?
that's
what
it
really
comes
to;
it's
just
like
a
piece
of
land.
mr.
archibald
cox
control.
control
that.
now,
there
was
a
question
before
the
master
as
to
what
--
by
what
part
of
the
executive
branch's
action
do
you
look.
before
i
go
on
to
that
message,
there's
one
thing
wrong.
this
is
not
a
peculiarly
american
rule;
for
example,
the
court
of
appeal
in
england
held,
when
the
question
came
up
there's
been
accident
in
bristol
channel.
the
attorney
general
came
in
did
something
we
didn't
do
here.
he
came
in
with
his
tentativeness
to
what
the
position
of
the
crown
was.
that's
the
case
of
the
fagernes,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
the
court
said
that
certificate
saying
that
bristol
channel
is
not
part
of
the
territory
of
the
crown
at
the
end
of
the
matter
and
refused
to
go
any
further.
and
that
now
here,
there
are
two
ways
before
the
master.
we
sought
to
establish,
what
were
the
criteria
that
governed
the
executive
branch
in
the
determination
of
water,
inland
waters?
first,
we
did
introduce
some
evidence
letters
from
the
state
department
setting
forth
those
criteria
and
they're
printed
in
the
back
of
my
brief.
second,
since
the
master
ruled
that
they
were
not
--
they
having
been
written
residence
in
1950,
or
there
about,
were
not
conclusive
as
to
what
was
the
policy
of
the
united
states
in
1947
which
was
what
he
felt
is
the
decisive
question.
he
receives
voluminous
evidence
on
how
the
government
actually
had
acted
and
with
that
evidence
in
front
of
him,
he
then
made
his
report.
now,
we
think
for
reasons
stated
in
our
brief
that
he
was
wrong,
that
the
letter
should
be
regarded
as
the
evidence
of
the
policies
of
the
executive
branch.
i
don't
care
to
argue
the
point
because
it
seems
perfectly
clear
to
us
that
the
historical
evidence
in
the
background
sustains
the
view
that
the
master
took.
and
i
now
propose
to
take
up
those
various
criteria
as
stated
by
the
state
department
in
its
letters
and
as
shown
by
the
act
of
practice.
and
show
that
under
those
criteria,
one
of
the
areas
in
question,
do
not
belong
to
california
because
they
are
not
inland
waters
as
--
by
the
criteria
the
executive
branch
has
applied
and
then
the
course
of
doing
that,
i
will
come
to
the
argument
about
monterey
bay
and
the
springing
lives
justified.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
i
think
that
i
would
have
to
be
--
i
would
have
to
have
i
would
say
that
there
must
also
be
some
statement
by
the
secretary
of
state
or
executive
branch
saying
that
we
accept
the
treaty
as
applicable
in
defining
our
boundaries.
mr.
archibald
cox
we've
accepted
it
and
yes,
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
may
i
say
two
things?
one,
this
is
the
point
in
our
case
that
gives
me
the
most
trouble,
quite
frankly.
if
i
had
to
say
what
is
the
weakest
find
in
your
case?
i
would
identify
this
one
except
perhaps
for
some
silly
little
detail,
alright.
second,
i
would
like
to
postpone
this
directing
myself
to
this
point
until
i
get
to
monterey
bay
specifically.
i've
been
trying
to
go
from
the
general
to
the
particular.
this
is
a
question
justice
harlan
that
affects
only
monterey
bay.
there
is
no
other
point
at
which
this
question
makes
a
difference
and
i
will
deal
with
it
when
i
get
there.
mr.
archibald
cox
monterey
bay
and
only
monterey
bay
meets
that
there
second
part
of
the
definition
of
a
bay
that
is
to
say.
it
satisfies
the
current
international
rule
that
qualifies
a
bay.
it
must
not
only
be
an
indentation
which
can
be
caused
by
a
line
24
miles
or
fewer
across
headland
to
headland.
but
it
must
also
contain
more
water
that
will
be
enclosed
in
a
semi-circle
with
a
diameter
equivalent
--
equal
to
the
closing
line
of
the
bay.
we
have
--
we
have
agreed
that
if
the
24-mile
closing
line
controls
then
we
have
no
argument
about
monterey
bay.
we
might
--
mr.
archibald
cox
being
an
inland
waters.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
would
say
that
it
was
landlocked
in
the
sense
that
we
understand
the
term
to
be
used.
they
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
evidence
was
admitted.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
sir.
it
could
that
i
will
deal
with
it.
it
could
be
admissible
under
my
argument
in
a
precise
sense.
it
could
be
one
of
the
criteria,
the
last
one
i
want
to
mention.
one
of
the
criteria's
stated
by
the
department
of
--
not
stated
by,
but
accepted
by
the
department
of
state
and
by
us
is
that
in
historic
bay
maybe
inland
waters,
even
though
it
does
not
satisfy
the
other
definition.
now,
i
shall
have
to
--
time
doesn't
run
out
on
me
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
and
discuss
at
some
length
what
kind
of
evidence
is
necessary
to
make
out
in
historic
bay.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
this
is
inland
waters
as
used
in
the
act,
it
seems
to
me,
then
we
lose.
that
that's
what
happens
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
depend
on
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
sir.
it
is
not.
it
is
--
if
at
first,
i
think
i
use
the
term
political
line
in
exactly
the
sense
that
you
use
the
term
territorial
line
because
i'm
sure
your
honor
would
agree
that
the
territorial
line
did
not
mark
the
outer
limit
of
the
state's
ownership.
the
state
did
not
own
out
to
its
territorial
line
in
the
sense
your
honor
just
used.
that
was
the
holding
in
the
united
states
against
california.
mr.
archibald
cox
yeah.
yes.
but
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
quite
true.
but
the
territorial
line
of
california
at
that
time
did
include
part
of
the
sea
and
therefore
you
cannot,
i
submit,
if
you
reiterate
the
case
have
held
that
california
owned
the
property
inside
the
territorial
line.
you
must
have
held
that
it
didn't.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
master
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
may
i
say
these
two
things.
one,
i
--
i've
asked
your
honor
to
reconsider
what
you
held
in
united
states
against
california
because
i
really
think
it
was
a
little
different
from
that.
but
i
can't
--
if
i'm
wrong,
i'm
wrong,
i
can't
add
what
i've
already
said.
second,
i
want
to
make
a
claim
that
we
deny
and
the
special
master
denied
that
the
boundary
of
california
as
california
was
admitted
included
any
of
these
waters.
whatever
you
mean
by
boundary?
it
did
not,
we
say,
run
out
around
the
islands.
it
did
not
we
say,
run
on
a
closing
line
of
any
of
these
bays
except
san
francisco
bays
and
the
others
meeting
the
description.
it's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
wonder,
i
think
that
i
can
answer
that
question
directly.
i
think
i'm
going
to
be
speaking
to
that
point
in
just
a
minute,
if
i
may,
alright.
now,
as
to
the
principles
that
the
master
replied,
the
first
principle
when
as
the
state
department
states
it,
the
master
found
it
and
way
of
we
think
always
replied
it,
is
the
territorial
waters
begin
at
the
low
water
line
along
relatively
straight
coast?
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
general
rule.
there
is
a
dispute
about
whether
the
low
water
line
means
as
we
think
it
does
the
average
of
all
low
waters
or
whether
it
means
its
california
thinks
it
does
on
this
coast
whether
of
two
types,
two
different
heights
of
tides
whether
it
names
the
average
of
the
lower
waters,
that
intriguing
detail
i
leave
to
my
brief.
the
second
rule
comes
to
what
mr.
justice
black
was
just
raised.
we
say
that
on
coast
with
minor
curvatures,
not
amounting
to
bays
which
i
will
define
very
exactly
later.
not
amounting
to
bays,
the
territory
or
other
estuaries,
harbors
and
the
like.
the
territorial
sea,
that's
the
coast
line,
begins
at
the
low
water
line,
alright,
and
its
inner
and
outer
boundaries,
if
necessarily,
follow
the
sinuosities
of
the
coast.
unlike
instead
of
going
point
to
point
subject
to
the
exception
about
bays
as
we
defend
which
i
will
come.
i
could
illustrate
this
very
quickly
on
this
map
which
shows
up
in
different
colors
here
that
it
did
in
my
office,
that's
the
problem.
we
say
that
the
coast
that
the
marginal
sea,
the
territorial
sea,
is
the
light
blue
line
and
plus
the
dark
blue
line.
in
other
words,
it
follows
around
the
sinuosities
in
each
island
has
its
own
territorial
sea.
we
put
san
francisco
bay
in
dark
blue
because
it
does
meet
the
definition
of
bay
and
is
landlocked
within
what
we
understand
to
be
the
meaning
of
landlocked.
and
therefore
at
that
point,
the
line
would
go
across
roughly
under
the
golden
gate
bridge.
now,
as
a
corollary
to
that
proposition,
we
say
that
territorial
waters
and
therefore
the
outer
inland
--
outer
limit
of
inland
waters
begins
at
the
low
water
line
around
islands
and
within
straits
that
connect
areas
of
the
open
sea
and
you'll
see
here
that
we
have
a
three-mile
belt
around
each
of
the
islands,
and
that
we
show
santa
barbara
channel
which
is
begins
at
point
conception
and
runs
east.
we
show
in
red
because
it
connects
what
we
understand
the
areas
of
the
open
sea.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
my!
yes!
60
to
70.
mr.
archibald
cox
much,
much
more.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
the
islands
where
within
six
miles
of
the
coast
because
the
territorial
waters
would
include
the
whole
thing,
unless,
unless,
the
strait
connected
areas
of
open
sea.
mr.
archibald
cox
then
the
policy
of
the
united
states
would
be
that
that
was
the
not
inland
sea.
it
would
be
territorial
waters
which
you
could
sail
through
it
but
it
would
the
inland
though
--
inland
waters.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
ground
underneath
it
would
belong
to
california,
we
concede
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
now,
the
special
master
accepted
these
three
rules
as
he
said
without
embarrassment
of
doubt.
he
found
the
united
states
as
traditionally
taken
the
position
that
the
baseline
of
the
marginal
belt
is
the
lower
water
mark
following
this
sinuosities
coast
and
not
drawn
from
headland
to
headland,
except
that
its
bay
is
not
more
than
10
miles
wide
the
baseline
is
a
straight
line
drawn
across
the
opening
of
such
indentation.
the
supporting
evidence
is
set
forth
in
his
report
and
that
length
in
our
brief;
i
think
it
would
be
a
waste
for
the
court's
time
for
me
to
attempt
to
go
through
it
because
it
does
have
to
be
looked
at
very
precisely
with
emphasis
upon
the
exact
words
and
the
incidents.
i
would
call
your
attention
particularly
to
the
statement
of
secretary
of
state
baird
in
1886,
where
he
very
clearly
sets
forth
this
rule
applying
it
to
islands.
it's
interesting
because
at
that
time,
he
was
speaking
of
our
own
coastline.
most
of
our
history
we've
been
engaged
in
debates
about
other
people's
coast
lines.
there
he
was
speaking
of
our
own
coast
line
in
alaska
and
he
said,
“if
we're
going
to
take
the
position
atlantic,
for
six-mile
bays
as
it
was
then,
and
that
they
can't
go
headland
to
headland
then
we've
got
to
agree
over
in
alaska
and
the
pacific
that
we
are
bound
by
the
same
rules,
and
that's
essentially
on
the
broad
the
position
that
we're
advocating
here
as
a
matter
of
very
important
current
policy
of
the
united
states,
i
may
say.”
this
is
not
just
a
matter
of
heads.
california,
argues
in
favor
of
what
she
calls
straight
baseline.
she
says
that
whatever
coast
is
indented
or
whether
there
are
islands
that
you
leap
from
point
to
point
and
i've
--
these
show
up
so
far
as
the
areas
in
this
case
is
concerned
and
the
first
at
monterey
bay
where
she
wants
jump
across.
then
she
gets
down
san
luis
obispo
and
she
wants
a
straight
line
there.
then
when
she
gets
point
conception,
she
says,
“we've
jumped
21
miles
or
24
miles
out
to
san
miguel
and
then
we
jumped
around
from
island
to
island,
point
to
point.”
now
as
i
understand
that
her
straight
baseline
and
the
reason
what
i
did
and
the
upper
part
of
the
coast
was
project
this
theory.
i
did
--
i
do
emphasize
my
projection,
california
does
not
necessarily
take
that
position.
i
was
just
trying
to
show
how
it
would
work
out
if
applied
consistently.
she
bases
the
--
her
argument
on
two
things.
on
the
norwegian
fisheries
case
that
decided
in
the
early
1950's
and
the
geneva
convention
which
we've
referred
to
before
which
was
signed
in
1958
ratified
by
us
in
'61.
the
geneva
convention
states
that
in
localities
where
the
shoreline
is
deeply
indented
and
cut
into
or
if
there's
fringe
of
violence
along
the
coast,
then
the
method
of
straight
baseline
joining
appropriate
points
may
be
employed
in
drawing
the
baseline
from
which
the
breadth
to
the
territorial
sea
is
to
be
made.
now,
we
say
that
that
provision
in
the
geneva
convention
is
irrelevant
for
three
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
we
say
that
the
act
was
enacted
in
1953
and
was
a
grant
as
of
that
time,
a
grant
in
present
and
that
--
from
then
on,
only
the
rules
of
property
law,
boundary
law
apply.
second,
we
said
the
california
coast
does
not
by
the
wildest
stretch
of
the
imagination
meet
the
description
in
the
norwegian
fisheries
case.
if
you
look
at
the
big
map
instead
of
a
few
super
impositions
of
particular
areas.
you'll
see
that
the
two
coasts
aren't
comparable
at
all.
my
friend
mr.
hayes
here,
he
may
have
an
argument
that
his
coast
to
somewhat
likely
norwegian
coast,
california
coast,
we
think
it's
the
altogether
different.
but
the
third
and
much
the
most
important
reason
is
that
the
straight
baseline
method
is
permissive.
its
states
what
a
state
made
of.
it
steps
in
the
very
language.
it
says
that
straight
baselines
may
be
implied.
and
there
is
another
section
immediately
after
this
or
sentence
which
says,
“the
coastal
state
must
clearly
indicate
straight
baseline
on
charts
to
which
due
publicity
must
be
given.”
now,
the
united
states
has
never
applied
the
straight
baseline
method
ever
--
mr.
archibald
cox
absolutely.
mr.
archibald
cox
california
cannot
decide
where
we
will
put
the
limits
of
our
territorial
sea
or
our
inland
water
under
an
international
treaty
and
we
--
i'm
not
going
to
stop
to
emphasize
all
the
points
of
involvement
on
this.
i
do
want
to
emphasize
most
empathically
that
the
united
states
executive
branch
on
foreign
relations
people.
and
defense
people
are
very
much
opposed
to
straight
baselines
in
other
parts
of
the
world.
they
try
to
discourage
people
from
using
straight
baselines.
and
this
of
course
means,
of
course,
is
one
has
to
do
in
all
relation
that
we
kept
go
drawing
a
lot
of
straight
baselines
ourselves
and
that
seems
to
us
to
be
of
the
utmost
importance
and
a
complete
answer
to
any
argument
based
on
the
norwegian
fisheries
case
or
the
geneva
convention.
mr.
archibald
cox
ah,
there's
a
wide
diversity
and
norway
of
course,
draws
direct
baselines.
other
nations
that
take
far
more
expensive
views,
we
do
this
pressure
do
take
and
more
large
notion
of
what
is
a
territorial
sea
in
three
miles.
but
our
policy
as
of
last
friday
remained
very
clear
on
this.
if
that
is
the
policy
as
the
executive
branch
sees.
now
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
just
--
it's
just
the
last
i
know
about
it,
mr.
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
quite
sure
this
is
far
better,
far
to
the
conviction
who
changed
over
the
weekend.
i
come
now
to
the
point
as
to
what
is
a
bay.
now,
we
say
that
to
qualify
as
a
bay
constituting
inland
waters.
an
indentation
must
be
landlocked
area,
a
landlocked
area
that
can
be
close
by
line
not
over
ten
miles
long.
landlocked
was
used
early
in
international
relation
in
speaking
of
bays
without
much
of
any
definition
and
i'm
not
able
to
say
exactly
what
people
meant
by
landlocked.
i
don't
think
anybody
knew.
i
was
interested
yesterday
when
mr.
hayes
drew
his
illustration
of
a
bay,
that
he
drew
something
that
was
really
an
indentation,
and
i
think
landlocked
does
suggest
that
meaning.
now,
as
the
matter
of
the
development
and
i
what
have
supposed
that
that
was
the
same
in
which
mr.
justice
black
used
it
and
the
court
used
it
in
the
california
case
as
a
matter
of
the
evolution
of
our
executive
policy
and
of
international
law,
landlocked
has
come
to
have
a
very
exact
meaning.
it
incorporates
the
semi-circle
tests
that
i
stated
little
earlier.
at
one
time,
it
looks
as
if
we
go
develop
along
the
lines
to
what's
known
as
the
boggs
formula.
monterey
bay
curiously
would
not
qualify
under
the
boggs
formula.
however,
as
i
said
before,
we
do
not
stand
on
that.
it
qualifies
under
the
semi-circle
test
and
our
only
objection
to
it
is
in
terms
of
closing
them.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
think
it
would
not
be
appropriate.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
master
applied
the
boggs
formula,
alright.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
because
the
boggs
formula
is
stricter.
we're
being
generous
in
saying
that
we
think
we
should
be
governed
by
the
semi-circle
tests
which
came
to
prevail
and
we
shifted
our
positions.
we
attack
some
of
it
in
the
brief.
we
shifted
our
position
at
our
expense
not
for
any
other
reasons,
alright.
so
much
time
has
elapsed
that
i
think
the
question
of
whether
the
24-mile
bay
rule
is
applicable
to
monterey
bay
is
when
that
i
ought
to
leave
to
the
breach.
i
did
undertake
to
discuss
it
but
it
involves
all
kinds
details
mr.
justice
and
i'm
getting
off
closed
to
the
end.
it
is
fairly
covered
in
our
answered
to
our
last
good
brief,
alright,
and
we
do
stand
on
the
position
that
this
was
a
grant
in
presenting
that
this
is
the
way
other
grants
to
the
states
--
mr.
archibald
cox
what?
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
deny
that
i
have
weak
point.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
other
base
of
san
pedro,
santa
monica,
and
san
luis
obispo
are
all
failed
to
meet
our
definition
of
landlocked.
and
i
may
say,
we
think
that
what
is
called
san
pedro
bay,
alright,
most
clearly
is
not
landlocked
or
bay
in
any
sense.
what've
they
got
is
one
point
and
then
they
try
to
find
a
place
somewhere
along
the
coastline
to
which
to
draw
a
straight
line.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
would
agree
everything
inside
the
breakwater
goes
to
this
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
may
well
be.
yes,
but
we
agreed
that
they
get
inside
the
breakwater.
there's
no
dispute
about
that
very
upper
end.
now,
the
third
or
i
perhaps
got
my
numbers
mixed.
the
remaining
rule
that
i
should
direct
myself
to
is
california's
claim
that
these
bays
are
historic
bays
in
terms
of
the
international
relations
of
the
united
states,
alright.
we
acknowledge
of
course
that
there
is
such
a
rule
that
our
bay
may
be
come
an
historic
bay.
if
it
becomes
an
historic
bay
in
the
sense
in
which
i
use
the
term,
it
then
becomes
part
of
the
inland
waters.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
correct.
and
that
illustration
of
an
historic
bay
is
chesapeake
bay,
now
there
is
delaware
bay
and
they
are
bays
as
historic
bays
because
we've
always
exercise
jurisdiction
of
it.
the
points
on
which
we
stand
here
because
first,
we
say
that
since
we
are
dealing
with
matters
of
external
policy
or
international
relations,
it
require
some
action
by
the
united
states
to
assert
sovereignty
over
these
areas
to
make
them
into
a
bay.
now,
like
what
california
may
have
done
or
may
not
have
done,
is
not
sufficient
to
make
the
body
of
the
water
an
historic
bay
within
the
international
law.
now,
the
master
dealt
with
this
very
effectively.
i
would
simply
emphasize
two
things
--
fir
--
three
really.
but
first
with
would
respect
to
these
bays,
california
has
parts
to
only
one
instance
with
respect
to
monterey
bay
and
one
instance
with
respect
to
santa
monica
bay,
in
which
she
actually
exercise
in
a
jurisdiction
over
those.
even
in
the
sense
that
one
would
exercise
them
over
territorial
waters.
she
never
did
any
others,
actually.
with
respect
to
san
pedro
bay,
california
never
did
anything
or
san
luis
obispo
so
far
as
we
know.
the
only
thing
she
cites
with
respect
to
san
pedro
bay
is
a
distinct
--
is
a
decision
by
a
federal
district
judge
dismissing
an
indictment
which
required
the
crime
of
piracy
to
be
committed
on
the
high
sea.
well,
that
certainly
was
the
claim
of
sovereignty
by
anybody.
he
was
dismissing
an
indictment
and
of
course,
what
he
did
was
the
very
practical
thing.
he
convicted
the
defendant
on
three
other
counts
of
a
crime
that
was
a
crime
regardless
of
the
status
of
the
waters,
so
that
i
don't
think
that
can
be
made
into
claim
with
jurisdiction
by
california
but
not
only
where
these
very
fragmentary
things.
there
were
things
directed
against
the
americans
or
american
corporation.
they
have
no
sense
where
things
that
would
have
come
to
the
attention
of
the
foreign
policy
making
parts
of
the
united
states,
so
that
there
can't
be
any
statement
of
it
that
we
failed
to
act
even
fell
so
our
foreign
relations
were
implicated.
and
third,
they
were
things
that
were
done
contrary
to
what
by
the
1920's
were
they
established
foreign
policy
criteria
of
the
united
states.
and
what
we
say
is
essentially,
the
most
important
is
that
under
those
circumstances
a
state
cannot
acquire
for
the
united
states
territory
and
make
it
part
of
their
territory
which
is
sovereign
to
the
united
states
in
the
sense
of
international
relations.
and
this
is
essentially
what
special
master
said
i
think
in
his
opinion.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
as
to
part
of
it,
it
is
a
legal
question.
i
think
that
i'm
--
it's
a
mixed
conclusion.
i'm
saying
that
so
far
as
it's
actual,
it
is
certainly
supported
by
evidence.
so
far
as
it
rest
on
the
principle
that
a
state's
acts
cannot
acquire
a
territory
for
the
united
states.
it's
a
correct
rule
of
law.
the
territory
acquiring
the
foreign
policy
doing
must
be
done
by
the
federal
governments.
but
the
master
also
did
find
mr.
justice
black
that
until
1949,
california
never
had
asserted
jurisdiction.
that,
we
say
is
a
factual
finding
and
we
say,
that's
supported
by
evidence
and
should
be
conclusive.
now,
the
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
emphasize,
it
goes
to
california's
historic
claims
of
whether
they
are
stated
in
terms
of
boundary
or
whether
they
are
stated
in
terms
of
historic
bays
for
international
purposes.
and
that
is
that
california's
boundaries
simply
do
not
include
the
areas
in
dispute.
what
california
has
to
rely
on
is
that
the
statute
is
that
her
constitution
with
which
she
was
admitted
in
19
--
1849,
after
drawing
a
complete
circuit
in
terms
of
an
outer
limit
of
the
state's
boundary
which
did
not
include
these
channel
islands.
then
he
said
after
it
also
all
islands,
bays,
harbors
along
the
coasts
and
that's
all
it
said,
alright,
and
the
admitting
act
took
her
in
with
that
constitution.
now,
i
don't
know
or
what
the
expressions
also
all
islands,
bays
and
so
forth
meant
to
the
people
in
1849.
the
bays
where
laid
--
big
bays,
were
labeled
bays
on
many
chart
that
point
out
that
the
bay
of
bengal,
biscay
bay,
the
bay
of
fundy,
campeachy
bay
are
all
labeled
as
bays
on
a
lot
of
charts,
but
nobody
contends
that
those
are
inland
waters.
there's
no
indication
in
the
california
constitution
as
to
what
they
meant.
it
would
to
seem
to
me
that
the
most
plausible
meaning
was
that
california
was
being
taken
in
with
those
islands,
bays,
and
harbors
to
which
the
united
states
would
be
entitled
under
the
rules
of
the
united
states.
it
was
then
applying
as
a
matter
of
its
external
international
relations
and
it
is
most
improbable.
add
a
period
when
the
united
states
was
engaged
in
fighting
for
the
six-mile
bays
with
great
britain
that
they
would
have
taken
california
in
using
bays
in
an
entirely
different
sense.
if
anything
is
to
be
inferred,
that
would
seem
to
me
to
be
the
most
plausible
inference.
but
i
must
admit
i
don't
know
anything
very
clear
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it's
tracked
down
to
the
end
of
a
line
described
and
meets
and
bounds
as
it
run
around
what
is
now
the
state
of
california
and
then
it
said
to
a
point
three
miles
from
the
ocean.
and
then
it
said,
northwesterly
to
the
point
of
beginning
and
then
it
said,
also.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
you
look
on
our
brief
on
page
173,
right
in
the
middle
of
the
page.
you'll
see
it
first
describe,
we
didn't
run
the
land
or
boundary
because
it
seems
unnecessary,
alright,
then
it
ends
up
--
then
some
of
the
lines
of
the
42nd
degrees
of
latitude
were
place
in
the
beginning.
also,
all
the
islands,
harbors,
and
bays
so
long
it
is
adjacent
to
the
pacific
coast.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true.
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
they
--
the
islands
are
unquestionably
part
of
california.
the
question
is
whether
california
is
entitled
to
the
waters
between
the
islands
and
the
shore?
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
but
we
have
agreed
that
the
islands
of
that
--
that
the
interesting
thing
mr.
justice
black,
is
that
when
you
read
and
it
takes
great
care
like
all
boundary
description.
when
you
read
the
statutes
enacted
over
the
years
by
the
california
legislature
describing
the
boundaries
of
the
counties,
the
constitution
requires
to
the
state
to
be
divided
into
counties.
the
county
boundary
lines
are
set
forth
by
meets
and
bounds.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
always
in
terms
that
suggest
that
these
waters
are
not
included
within
the
meets
and
bounds
description.
and
in
some
instances,
in
terms
very
specifically
that
put
the
state
boundary
are
only
three
miles
from
the
shore
of
the
land.
now,
this
has
been
a
long
case
and
i'm
not
going
to
ask
the
court
to
go
through
those
details
here.
but
i
would
emphasize
that
part
of
our
brief
because
it
that
seems
to
me
tremendously
persuasive
evidence
of
how
the
legislature
itself
construed
the
earlier
state
constitution
and
as
part
of
the
total
context
of
whether
they
ever
claimed
to
make
this
historic
bay.
i
do
want
to
emphasize,
alright,
just
three
points
in
this
connection.
one
is
that
in
describing
and
with
the
court
is
too
good
as
to
turn
to
the
little
map
folded
into
our
brief.
in
the
very
back,
you
will
note
the
point
d
about
the
center
up
with
the
top.
now
--
no,
excuse
me,
point
c.
there
is
one
that's
toward
the
head
of
san
pedro
bay.
i
simply
want
to
emphasize
that
there
is
one
statute
enacted
in
the
19th
century,
that
draws
the
line
between
orange
county
which
is
south
of
white
sea
in
los
angeles
county
to
the
north,
and
it
describes
it
that
takes
c
which
is
coyote
creek
and
it
describes
the
boundary
at
one
point
as
running
three
miles
from
the
center
of
the
mouth
of
coyote
creek
to
the
southwestern
boundary
of
california.
that's
what
i
would
say
literally
accurate
that
the
point
is
the
same
as
i
make
which
clearly
shows
where
that
legislature
thought
the
boundary
road.
now,
the
second
point
i
particularly
want
to
emphasize
in
this
boundary
description,
is
that
there
was
a
statute
passed
in
1919,
cutting
ventura
county
off
from
los
angeles
county
and
it
describes
the
boundaries
of
los
angeles
county
in
terms
of
a
complete
circuit
with
a
line
paralleling
the
coast.
and
then
it
says
and
also
catalina
and
san
clemente
islands
and
a
three-mile
line
around
them,
which
of
course
were
the
very
boundaries
for
which
we
contend.
the
third
thing
that
i
want
to
emphasize
with
respect
to
the
boundary
description
and
you
need
to
look
at
the
map
to
see
this,
san
nicholas
island
is
in
ventura
county
by
explicit
statement
in
a
statute.
santa
barbara
island
is
in
santa
barbara
county
by
explicit
statement
in
a
statute.
now,
it
takes
--
first,
i
thought
it
couldn't
be
done.
it
takes
some
imagination
to
get
continuous
lines
that
don't
overlap.
it
will
put
santa
barbara
county
in
santa
barbara
santa
barbara
islands
in
santa
barbara
county
and
san
nicholas
island
in
ventura.
you
can
do
it
justice
goldberg
with
the
great
big
j
that
hooks
out
in
around
it.
but
if
you'll
read
the
boundaries
of
legislature
wrote,
they
just
can't
have
had
in
mind.
and
this
seems
to
us
to
be
almost
in
mathematical
demonstration
confirming
our
understanding
of
the
other
boundaries.
now,
counsel
had
come
up
with
--
mr.
archibald
cox
now,
i
might
get
involved
premises
now
because
i'm
arguing
it's
not
an
historic
bay.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
wouldn't
think
so.
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
the
evidence
is
here.
we
didn't
try
to
case
on
that
theory.
whether
we
could
find
more
evidence,
i
don't
know,
but
i
don't
think
we
wanted
to
go
back.
i
think
we
are
contend
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
take
it
down
the
california's
premises.
i
did
want
to
talk
just
a
little
bit
more
about
the
location
of
these
islands
because
that
counsel
has
come
up
with
the
most
marvelous
explanation,
alright.
they've
got
the
maps
in
the
back
of
this
green
brief
which
show
that
the
army
engineers
and
the
land
officers
of
the
department
of
interior
in
1887.
unlike
the
legislature,
it
knew
where
santa
barbara
county
--
what
county
was
it
in.
it
was
in
they
say,
all
the
time
because
nobody
know
at
los
angeles
county.
and
since
the
island
is
in
los
angeles
county
and
not
santa
barbara
county,
then
of
course,
there
is
no
difficult.
well,
now
i
wonder
what
would
happen,
if
we
came
to
court
and
argued
that
santa
barbara
county
--
what
santa
barbara
island
was
in
los
angeles
county
on
that
basis
squarely
contrary
to
the
statutes
of
california.
the
lines
are
a
matter
of
fact,
i
thought
i
did
time
but
i
don't.
the
lines
on
those
two
maps
if
you
look
at
them
are
only
dotted
sort
of
broken
projections
out
into
the
water.
they
do
not
describe
a
boundary
running
around
the
islands
the
way
california's
briefs
as
i
read
it,
says,
they
do.
those
lines
are
i
would
think
unjustified
extrapolation
it
is
either
simply
broken
dashes
with
no
closing
line
between
them
with
at
all.
why
the
map
make
you
did
that?
i
don't
know.
the
current
brad
mcnally
commercial
ad
does
both,
it
puts
county
lines
surround
the
island.
it
also
has
these
broken
lines
intended
to
show
in
a
general
way
when
it
went
but
plainly
the
state's
statute
is
more
important
than
anything
that
a
map
can
do.
to
begin
our
final
portion
of
our
argument,
we
would
like
to
meet
the
government
on
exactly
the
ground
which
is
chosen
to
argue
on
this
morning.
we
were
asked
yesterday
what
would
be
our
position
if
there
were
no
submerged
lands
act
or
if
our
basic
position
was
wrong.
we
have
demonstrated
what
we
believed
to
be
the
proper
approach
to
establishing
the
coastline
under
the
submerged
lands
act.
this
court
has
already
ruled
and
we
believed
correctly
that
congress
intended
to
measure
the
area
involved
in
the
act
in
terms
of
the
historic
boundaries
as
approved
by
congress
and
not
in
terms
of
us
foreign
relation
as
of
1953
or
any
other
date.
assuming,
however,
either
that
the
united
states
is
correct
in
its
position
or
that
they
were
no
submerged
lands
act.
we
believe
that
california
has
shown
in
its
brief
with
its
claims
as
to
inland
waters
are
consistent
with
international
law
and
a
properly
ascertained
united
states
international
relations
practice
and
whatever
they
may
be
deem
the
proper
date
whether
it
is
1849,
1947,
1953
or
today.
as
we
have
shown
in
our
briefs
the
far
over
its
base
or
other
landlocked
water
was
accepted
generally
long
before
the
rule
relating
the
three-mile
limited
territorial
waters
became
crystallized.
that's
in
1793
attorney
general
randolph
in
his
opinion
concerning
delaware
bay,
phrased
the
international
law
concerning
jurisdiction
over
bays.
similarly,
in
1882,
the
second
court
of
commissioners
of
unit
alabama
claims
in
the
case
of
the
alleganian
also
traced
the
same
concept
in
holding
chesapeake
bay
to
inland
waters.
now,
what
factors
are
present
in
the
delaware
and
chesapeake
bay
cases?
if
you
gentlemen
will
analyze
these
cases,
you
will
find
that
both
delaware
and
chesapeake
opinions
are
premise
on
certain
factors
all
of
which
are
equally
present
in
the
case
of
california's
bays.
and
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
the
purpose
of
this
first
argument,
i'm
talking
only
about
the
three
bays,
monterey,
san
pedro,
and
santa
monica.
one,
the
claim
to
these
bays
did
not
violate
international
law
as
it
then
existed.
two,
the
waters
of
the
bays
are
bounded
by
land
of
several
of
the
states
of
the
united
states
and
therefore,
by
the
united
states.
three,
the
bays
did
not
lead
from
the
sea
to
the
dominions
of
any
foreign
nations.
four,
the
process
and
interest
to
the
united
states
and
the
respective
states
in
this
case
great
britain
also
claimed
that
bays
are
part
of
its
territory.
five,
the
states
of
the
united
states
bordering
the
bays
of
exercised
jurisdiction
over
the
bays.
six,
the
united
states
is
exercised
jurisdiction
over
the
bays
by
creating
revenue
districts
which
clearly
in
compose
the
bays.
now,
let
us
turn
to
the
california
bays
and
apply
these
tests
to
the
california
bays.
first,
in
1849
and
1950
acclaimed
it
all
of
bays
along
the
california
coast
required
that
the
california
--
for
the
part
of
the
territory
of
california
was
consistent
with
international
law.
two,
these
bays
are
bounded
by
the
land
of
the
state
of
california
and
the
united
states.
three,
the
bays
do
not
lead
to
the
dominion
of
any
foreign
nation.
four,
california's
predecessors
in
this
case
in
mexico,
claimed
the
bays
are
part
of
their
territory.
five,
the
california
is
always
claimed
the
bays
and
its
constitution
and
exercise
jurisdiction
over
them.
and
finally
and
perhaps
as
importantly
as
any
other
point,
the
united
states
in
1849
created
a
revenue
collection
district
which
included
and
i
quote,
as
it
appears
in
our
opening
brief
at
page
58,
“all
of
ports,
harbors,
bays,
rivers,
and
waters
in
the
mainland
of
the
territory
of
upper
california
which
subsequently
became
a
state
of
california.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
included
ocean
industries
which
is
monterey
bay
and
people
versus
carrillo
which
is
the
san
pedro
bay.
there
was
no
mention
made
hackwood
nor
in
this
memorandum
if
i
remember
of
the
stralla
which
is
the
santa
monica
bay
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
citation
appears
in
our
brief.
this
enclosing
brief
at
pages
39
and
40,
the
memorandum
itself
was
in
the
yearbook
of
the
international
law
commission
for
1950,
volume
ii,
at
pages
60
and
61
also
cited
in
our
brief.
now,
the
recent
literature
on
historic
waters
and
i've
mentioned
a
minute
ago
is
emphasized
or
it's
exemplified
by
us
naval
commanders
stroll's
book
which
is
called
“the
international
law
of
bays”.
this
book
is
published
in
1963.
commander
stroll
lists
only
seven
historic
bays
in
the
united
states.
now,
what
are
these
seven
bays?
they
are
penobscot
bay,
long
island
sound,
delaware
bay,
chesapeake
bay,
and
the
three
california
bays
which
we've
cited.
another
writer,
buschey
who
has
written
on
this
subject
has
cited
two
of
our
bays
as
historic
bays
among
the
few
united
states
bays
which
he
have
cited
as
historic
bays.
we
say
that
these
california
bays
are
not
historic
bays
that
it
must
be
concluded
that
now
that
the
areas
mentioned
are
historic
waters
and
that
no
such
waters
exist
in
the
united
states.
we
believe
this
is
not
a
tenable
conclusion.
now,
the
government
complained
and
i
should
mention
these
points
of
certain
points
about
our
evidences
to
the
bays.
the
united
states
as
the
acts
must
three
of
those
united
states
and
not
california
or
on
the
other
alternative
that
california's
acts
are
invalid
if
disclaimed
by
the
federal
government.
we
have
shown,
we
believe,
on
our
briefs
on
the
acts
of
the
constituent
member
of
the
federation
can
have
validity
internationally
without
regard
to
the
assertion
by
the
united
states
which
we
say
has
occurred
of
the
validity
of
these
acts.
more
importantly,
not
only
as
the
united
states
not
disclaimed
the
california
cases
but
as
we
had
pointed
out,
it
has
affirmatively
relied
on
that.
as
far
as
the
rest
of
the
world
is
concerned,
these
cases
are
acts
of
the
united
states.
the
government
claims
that
we
must
not
only
show
that
these
bays
are
historic
bays
but
that
they
are
historic
inland
waters.
we
have
showed
that
bays
however
defined
have
always
had
the
states
is
different
from
that
of
a
territorial
sea,
the
marginal
boat
and
that
such
state
is
now
called
whatever
that
they
have
been
called
in
the
past,
“inland
waters”.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
would
concede
that
immediately.
there
are
references
to
bays
for
example
of
literatures
such
as
the
bay
on
this
bay,
a
very
large
water
and
--
mr.
archibald
cox
right.
but
we
would
--
we
would
point
out
that
the
--
to
your
honors,
that
are
many
bays
which
are
considered
historic
bays
in
international
law
and
which
are
recognized
as
such
by
the
united
states
and
particularly
up
new
from
them
where
with
that
a
great
deal
with
american
fishing
group
here
for
almost
200
years
which
historic
bays
have
headlands,
for
example,
in
the
case
of
concepcion
bay,
it
is
wide
as
50
or
60
miles.
far
wider
than
the
headlands
of
any
other
bays
which
are
involved
as
historic
bays
within
the
united
states.
and
i
don't
believe
that
anyone
would
seriously
contend
on
the
state
department
would
seriously
contend
at
this
point
that
those
bays
are
not
historic
bays
for
international
relations
purposes.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
correct.
and
we
say
that
is
the
proper
test
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we
say
this
is
the
proper
test
not
only
under
that
law
as
it
existed
before
1958
or
‘64
as
you
may
see
with
respect
to
the
applicability
to
geneva
convention.
but
then
in
1964,
it's
made
perfectly
clear
in
the
geneva
--
when
the
fifth
--
in
convention
which
is
now
on
effect
incidentally
the
last
nation
the
required
ratify
it
in
september,
so
it
is
now
in
effect
as
an
actual
convention
or
treaty
of
the
united
states.
in
that
convention
and
it's
made
perfectly
clear
that
historic
bays
do
not
have
to
meet
all
these
technical
rules
about
what
you
have
heard
this
morning.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
say
--
we
say
that
it
has
been
perfectly
clear
in
the
law
that
historic
bays
as
such
do
not
end
from
an
examination
of
hackwood
in
this
memorandum.
we
feel
confident
that
she
will
come
to
the
conclusion
if
this
is
so.
and
we
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we
don't
think
they
said
that
and
i
don't
think
you'll
find
anything
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
the
letters
really
deal,
if
you'll
examine
them
closely,
i
think
in
the
proper
context
with
what
the
technical
rules
are
for
bays
which
are
not
historic
bay.
you
will
find
in
one
of
those
letters
and
i
don't
want
to
take
the
time
to
put
my
finger
on
it
now.
but
i
think
if
you
will
examine
it
later,
you
will
find
somewhere
buried
in
the
letter
a
statement
to
the
effect
that
always
rules
don't
apply
to
historic
bays
which
is
still
a
rule
on
the
geneva
convention.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
say
--
we
of
course,
in
our
basic
position
don't
get
there.
but
secondly,
if
we
do
get
there
--
right,
right.
but
if
we
do
get
there,
we
say
this,
the
state
department
has
never
said
with
respect
to
these
bays.
they
said
they're
reversed.
they
haven't
made
a
positive
--
mr.
archibald
cox
they
are
not
really
saying
that
we
say.
i
don't
like
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
i
don't
understand
him
to
have
form
that
strongly
but
let's
assume
that
he
did.
i
say
that
that
is
not
the
best
expression
of
state
department
policy.
i
say
that
the
official
digest
of
the
state
department
and
the
official
expression
of
opinion
of
the
state
department
to
the
united
nations
has
expressed
by
the
memorandum
which
we
have
referred
to
is
the
expression
of
the
state
department.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
i
would
say
frankly
that
we
don't
regard
the
state
department
as
having
a
right.
this
is
really
a
part
of
our
basic
position
that
we
will
get
to
hear
in
a
minute
if
i
have
the
time.
we
don't
regard
the
state
department
as
having
the
right
of
fixing
inland
waters
for
the
purposes
at
least
of
this
act
or
for
the
purposes
that
we're
here
before
the
court
in
this
case
on.
we
don't
--
we
say
that
they
can
not
by
a
simple
unilateral
assertion
or
a
simple
unilateral
statement,
convert
inland
waters
of
a
state
into
what
they
may
say
are
not
inland
waters.
we
say
that
can
not
be
done.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
say
that
it
doesn't.
we
say
that
it
does
nothing
and
we
say
it
for
the
same
reason
that
we
believe
this
court
said
and
second
in
louisiana
case.
we
say
that
these
questions
are
divisible.
in
effect,
if
you
--
if
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
the
second
louisiana
case
and
the
second
texas
case,
this
court
said,
“for
the
purposes
of
this
act,
submerged
lands
act,
we're
going
to
run
this
line
out
ten-and-a-half-mile.”
now,
it's
true
for
foreign
relations
purposes.
for
the
purposes
of
the
foreign
relations
so
far
as
the
united
states,
maybe
the
line
only
goes
out
three-mile.
you
went
on
to
say
on
that
case,
very
explicitly
that
there
might
be
different
lines
for
different
purposes,
that
this
is
a
problem
of
dividing
the
line
between
the
nation
and
the
state.
mr.
archibald
cox
right.
right,
exactly.
in
other
words
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we
--
we
agree
this
is
true
but
we
would
say
this
is
a
matter
of
logic.
if
that
rule
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
naturally
are
trying
to
gain
the
maximum
advantage
of
the
case
applied.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
we
say
this
is
a
matter
of
logic,
justice
harlan.
that
the
segment
determines
the
belt
which
these
states
are
to
get
under
the
submerge
lands
act
is
this
line.
this
coast
line
whatever
it
is.
and
if
the
argument
can
be
made
which
the
state
department
--
which
the
government
attempts
to
make,
that
this
--
the
inner
portion
of
this
area
can
be
determined
by
state
department
policy
and
not
by
historic
boundaries
or
the
history
--
to
what
the
state's
have
under
the
pollard
rule
prior
to
the
1947
decision
in
the
first
california
case,
then
the
state
department
is
in
the
position
of
controlling
where
that
area
is
going
to
be
under
the
submerged
lands
act
and
we
say
this
was
not
the
intent
of
congress.
now,
with
respect
to
the
overall
unit
area,
we
will
be
the
first
that
can
see
that
our
argument
is
not
that
strong
by
the
overall
unit
area,
i
mean
entire
santa
fe
--
the
entire
area
which
covers
the
area
from
point
conception
down
to
the
point
long.
we
do
now
recall
the
court's
attention
to
this
fact
and
we
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
if
the
court
agrees
with
our
basic
premises
at
least
that
pays
but
the
matter
should
go
back
to
the
special
master.
you
all
notice
that
with
respect
to
santa
barbara
channel,
this
closing
line
is
only
21
miles,
under
this
24-mile
rule.
this
particular
line
over
here,
if
i
remember
it
correctly,
between
the
post
and
capital
is
by
11
miles.
this
is
actually
between
the
green
line
in
the
west.
we
believe
that
there
is
a
possibility
and
i
emphasize
there
only
a
possibility,
i
want
to
be
very
frank
with
the
court
that
we
could
prove
that
this
area
under
this
theory
under
the
present
state
of
the
law
if
permitted
to
do
so
is
inland
waters.
the
master
of
course
is
taking
the
position
it
did
that
this
was
entirely
a
matter
of
external
sovereignty.
really
he
didn't
give
this
matter
any
serious
consideration
at
all.
the
only
areas
that
the
master
really
seriously
considered,
we
say,
is
the
question
of
historic
waters
and
we
say
there
he
was
wrong.
now,
i
like
to
spend
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
and
incidentally
one
further
point
i
would
like
to
make
it
clear
and
i
think
it
should
best
be
made
clear
by
using
the
solicitor
general's
map
rather
than
our
own
because
it
includes
the
whole
coast
of
california.
we
don't
make
a
serious
contention
that
usually
goes
up
and
down
the
entire
state
of
california
using
the
straight
baseline
systems
and
we
don't
want
the
court
so
to
understand
nor
do
we
want
the
court
to
understand
that
in
drawing
a
line
across
monterey
bay,
for
example,
because
that
we
--
we
consider
that
involving
a
use
the
strait
baseline
system.
our
contention
here
is
based
entirely
upon
the
doctrine
of
the
historic
water.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
straight
baseline
system
just
because
a
straight
line
is
drawn
across
the
miles
with
the
bay.
the
only
area
in
which
the
straight
baseline
system
might
become
applicable
is
again
down
in
the
area
involving
the
santa
barbara
islands
where
these
islands
do
will
probably
friends
in
the
coast.
we
say
there
are
similarities
but
these
islands
and
this
bring
the
islands
to
the
islands
off
the
coast
of
norway.
the
government
of
course
strenuously
disagrees.
we
think
this
is
a
matter
that
would
have
to
be
going
into
in
extenso
substantial
and
additional
proof
would
have
to
be
submitted.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
--
no,
we
are
not
--
we
are
not
promulgating
baseline
as
such.
we
simply
say
that
you
could
draw
the
lines
around
here
and
enclose
the
theory.
we
don't
want
to
leave
a
theory
would
--
we're
going
to
follow
the
straight
baseline
theory
as
such.
this
i
want
to
make
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
we
claim
this
entire
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we
say
that
primarily,
particularly,
with
respect
to
this
area
here
that
it
lies
on
the
historic
content.
we
say
that
with
respect
to
the
entire
area
that
we
construe
our
constitution
as
we
point
out
on
our
brief
to
allow
us
to
go
on
the
line
in
the
general
northwesterly
direction
and
this
provided
in
the
constitution.
and
as
the
drawing
in
that
line
in
the
general
northwesterly
direction
would
cover
a
line
which
goes
along
the
outer
side
of
the
island.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
that
would
be
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
sir.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
our
claim
sir.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
the
control
of
the
islands,
sir.
the
constitution
contains
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
ownership
of
island
contains
specifically
that
is
a
separate
provision
at
the
end
of
the
statute
itself
where
it
says
all
islands
based
and
so
on
are
the
in
the
boundary
description.
all
islands
base
are
included.
we
think
a
logical
and
consistent
explanation
of
that
clause
that's
the
first
clause
about
drawing
the
line
in
the
northwesterly
direction.
it
requires
the
inclusion
of
the
intervening
waters
to
be
put
--
to
be
considered
as
inland
waters
and
in
which
of
the
boundary
of
the
state,
and
we
think
this
is
particularly
true
with
respect
to
this
area.
but
i
want
to
make
it
clear
once
more
and
i
want
to
leave
this
feeling
with
the
court
very
strongly
that
is
that
this
argument
we
believe
is
a
different
argument
and
should
be
evaluated
in
a
different
basis
and
argument
with
respect
with
these
three
bays.
we
say
these
three
bays
down
on
their
own
feet
without
benefited
any
other
argument
so
that
the
most
that
we've
already
given
when
we
accept.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
our
position
at
this
point
is
that
you
could
not,
in
our
opinion,
considering
what
the
special
master
did,
make
a
proper
evaluation.
we
think
with
respect
with
the
bays,
the
master
did
do
enough,
that
there
is
enough
in
his
report,
that
there's
enough
from
the
cases
and
enough
for
the
law
to
make
an
evaluation
at
this
time.
mr.
archibald
cox
with
respect
to
his
--
mr.
archibald
cox
pardon?
mr.
archibald
cox
with
respect
to
the
bays,
we
would
ask
you
to
rule
on
our
favor
and
to
rule
at
the
bays,
our
historic
bays,
and
at
the
bays
are
heretofore
been
are
properly
defined
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
or
in
northern
district
california
and
the
southern
district
of
california.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
think
that
there
are
enough
facts
in
the
record
and
in
these
cases
to
make
that
determination.
if
the
court
felt
that
its
necessary
advisable
into
send
the
entire
amount
fact
to
the
master
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
sir.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
we
think
the
basic
--
the
basic
thing
that's
wrong
with
the
master's
position
is
its
legal
position.
in
other
words,
his
legal
conclusions
which
we
think
this
court
can
easily
examine
were
--
were
wrong.
we
think
that
the
fact's
said
the
basic
facts
that
where
there
are
probably
sufficient
for
this
court
applying
the
correct
law
to
arrive
as
what
we
would
believe
would
be
the
correct
decision
or
agency.
but
we
think
that
with
respect
to
the
other
area,
it
might
be
difficult.
we
are
not
averse
so
i
want
to
make
this
final
point.
we
are
not
averse
to
having
the
entire
matter
turned
back
to
a
master
for
determination
of
the
facts
as
well
as
the
law.
but
we
do
feel
that
this
court
should
establish
the
basic
principles
which
should
be
applied
in
making
such
a
determination.
that
is
the
very
least
that
we
hope
that
we
will
receive
from
this
case.
now
that
completes
my
argument.
