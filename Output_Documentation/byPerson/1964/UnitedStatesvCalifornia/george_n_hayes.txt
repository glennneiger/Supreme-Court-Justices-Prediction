mr.
george
n.
hayes
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court,
i'm
counsel
for
united
states
and
the
state
of
california.
oh,
thank
you.
our
position
here
is
with
reverence
to
one
point
only
and
it
does
not
concern
itself
with
all
of
the
claims
of
california
or
other
replies
or
claims
of
the
united
states
with
the
regard
to
those
claims.
we
are
here
merely
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
when
the
united
states
executive
enlarges
upon
the
juridical
bay
whether
or
not
that
and
your
to
the
benefit
of
the
several
states.
in
going
on
to
that,
i
think
that
despite
what
has
been
said
in
all
our
briefs
about
international
law,
international
law
is
not
directly
pertinent
in
here
and
the
only
place
it
isn't
relevant,
it
may
be
pertinent
in
that
united
states
coastal
seaward
boundaries
and
state
seaward
boundaries
have
always
been
identical
in
the
past
and
in
that
respect
it
may
be
pertinent.
otherwise,
it
isn't
relevant
nor
is
the
submerged
lands
act
relevant
in
this
case
at
all.
i
think
that
what
is
important
in
determining
whether
or
not
california
is
to
be
the
given
the
benefit
of
the
present
united
states
recognized
juridical
bay
that
is
one
that's
closed
by
land
24
miles
or
not
we
have
to
look
at
what
the
congress
did
when
it
admitted
california
into
the
union,
the
act
of
admission
and
the
intent
of
congress
at
that
time
as
interpreted
by
the
courts
and
as
affected
by
the
development
of
the
law
after
that
and
in
fact
during
that
time.
when
congress
admitted
california,
it
didn't
say
anything
in
the
act
of
admission
as
to
whether
or
not
bays
were
included
that
is
geographical
bays
or
as
to
whether
or
not
juridical
bays
which
is
less
than
a
geographical
bay
it's
the
bay
within
the
natural
bay
that
is
made
by
virtue
of
the
sovereign
saying,
we're
not
going
to
recognize
our
sovereignty
seaward
of
a
certain
line.
today,
it's
a
24
miles
and
in
1953
it
was
10
miles,
before
that
it
was
six
miles.
the
california
constitution
includes
bays
and
the
act
of
admission
seems
to
adopt
the
california
constitution
and
from
what
counsel
for
california
have
presented,
it
seems
to
indicate
that
the
framers
of
the
california
constitution
thought
of
bays
in
terms
of
a
geographical
bay
not
a
juridical
bay.
however,
going
beyond
that
point
which
may
be
pertinent
only
to
california
but
going
beyond
that
point
to
a
point
which
is
important
to
us
and
california,
i
want
to
just
cite
to
the
court
what
writers
of
the
day
indicated
what
was
meant
when
the
word
“bays”
was
referred
to
generally
and
just
two
very
brief
statements,
your
honor.
one
is
by
secretary
of
state
buchanan
and
he
made
the
statement
as
appears
in
the
california
brief
on
page
54
with
his
background,
the
united
states
secretary
of
state
buchanan
statement
of
january
23,
1849,
one
year
before
the
admission
of
california
is
illuminating,
“the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
a
nation
extends
to
the
ports,
harbors,
bays,
mouths
of
rivers,
and
adjacent
parts
of
the
sea
enclosed
by
headlands.”
now,
in
addition
to
that,
that
was
said
in
1849.
in
1910,
the
permanent
court
of
arbitration
pronounced
or
rather
spoke
of
what
men
and
governments
considered
when
the
word
“bay”
was
used
and
they
said
as
mr.
keatinge
quoted,
“now
considering
that
the
treaty
may
refer
into
anglo-american
treaty,
what
the
treaty
that
the
treaty
used
the
general
term
bays
without
qualification
as
did
the
california
constitution.
the
tribunal
is
of
the
opinion
that
these
words
of
the
treaty
must
be
interpreted
in
a
general
sense
as
applying
to
every
bay
on
the
coast
in
question
that
might
reasonably
suppose
to
have
been
considered
as
a
bay
by
the
negotiators
of
the
treaty
under
the
general
conditions
and
prevailing.”
the
negotiators
of
the
treaty
of
1818
did
probably
not
trouble
themselves
with
subtle
theories
concerning
the
notion
of
bays.
they
most
probably
thought
that
everybody
would
know
what
was
a
bay?
in
this
popular
sense,
the
term
must
be
interpreted
in
the
treaty.
and
your
honor,
i
think
what
they
meant
by
the
most
--
what
everybody
would
think
of
when
they
thought
of
bays
is
this
landlocked
waters.
waters
that
go
into
the
land
of
a
sovereign
and
are
imposed
by
the
land
of
that
single
sovereign
and
that
is
most
probably
what
california
had
in
mind
and
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
they
admitted
california
into
the
union.
but
let's
assume
they
didn't
and
that
congress
had
in
mind
something
less
than
a
geographical
bay
which
is
landward
of
the
natural
entrance
point.
let's
assume
that
congress
had
in
mind
a
juridical
bay.
then
the
question
comes
up,
what
kind
of
juridical
bay?
a
juridical
bay
that's
defined
by
a
10-mile
closure,
a
24-mile
closure
or
a
six-mile
closure.
they
couldn't
have
been
thinking
of
10,
they
had
no
idea
at
that
time
or
no
very
good
idea,
i
would
say,
that
we
would
go
to
10
but
let's
say
that
they
might
have
been
thinking
of
10.
if
they
were
thinking
of
10,
they
certainly
might
have
thought
that
someday
the
united
states
would
extend
its
juridical
bay
further
out
to
sea
than
10
and
in
fact
we
have.
the
only
thing
that
was
in
existence
at
that
time
by
way
of
a
juridical
bay
was
a
six-mile
closure
line,
in
1850,
and
that
six-mile
closure
line
went
on
a
clear
past
the
turn
of
this
century.
so
if
all
congress
meant
to
give
to
the
territorial
limits
of
california
was
a
juridical
bay
it
must
have
been
a
six-mile
bay.
and
yet
your
honors,
the
united
states
is
not
contending
and
wouldn't
contend
for
a
minute
that
all
this
court
should
define
is
being
within
the
territory
of
california
is
all
those
landward
of
a
six-mile
line
and
really
for
good
reason
they
don't
because
it
isn't
the
law.
it
isn't
what
congress
intended
to
do
back
in
the
day
when
it
admitted
california.
the
law
has
developed
and
the
law
is
simply
this
and
while
the
submerged
lands
isn't
necessary
to
show
this
to
the
court
and
while
the
submerged
lands
act
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
directly
as
it
was
written,
the
legislative
history
of
the
submerged
lands
act
does
help
illuminate
us
on
this
point
and
the
law
is
this
that
congress
can
be
considered
to
have
meant
a
juridical
bay
but
a
juridical
bay
they
must
have
known
was
a
bay
that
didn't
have
any
fixed
line
that
a
juridical
bay
is
subject
to
changing
of
a
fixed
line.
it's
a
dynamic
thing.
it's
not
a
static
thing
and
that's
what
congress
meant
when
they
were
talking
about
establishing
a
line
in
a
submerged
lands
act
that
would
define
inland
waters,
demarcate
inland
waters
from
high
seas.
they
said,
“we
will
leave
this
matter
where
we
found
it.”
they
were
thinking
at
one
time
of
using
the
word
“bays”
and
as
the
court
will
recall,
the
intention
of
congress
whatever
the
result
actually
was
in
the
submerged
lands
act,
the
intention
of
congress
was
to
do
this
was
to
give
the
states
back
the
territorial
sea,
the
three-mile
belt
and
the
to
make
very
sure
that
the
doctrine
that
was
enunciated
by
this
court
in
u.s.a.
versus
california
was
not
sign
of
things
to
come
and
he
went
on
and
he
talked
about
other
navigable
inland
waters
and
they
talked
about
the
entire
bay
and
at
the
suggestion
of
the
u.s.
state
department
that
pointed
out
to
them,
that
these
concepts
had
changed
and
they
were
subject
to
change
and
that
it
would
embarrass
the
united
states
if
congress
would
try
include
a
whole
bay
if
congress
withdrew
but
by
withdrawing
didn't
mean
that
they
intended
to
establish
that
in
so
far
as
any
state
was
concerned
washington
or
alaska
or
california
that
its
inland
waters
would
be
fixed
by
10
miles.
if
that
had
any
validity,
the
united
states
would
be
cleaning
here
today
that
no
one
of
the
several
coastal
states
could
have
any
greater
inland
waters
than
a
line
that
was
drawn
or
could
have
been
drawn
at
the
time
it
was
admitted
into
the
union.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well,
i
think
the
congress
recognize
that
mr.
justice,
that
the
inland
waters
of
a
state
were
not
to
be
fixed
as
they
were
in
1953
that
is
if
we
take
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
oh,
but
they're
saying
just
the
opposite
here.
if
they
were
--
that
i
think
is
the
law.
i
--
i
think
that
it
is
the
law
and
should
be
law
but
the
united
states
isn't
seeing
that.
the
united
states
is
seeing
and
their
position
is
inconsistent.
their
present
position
is
inconsistent
with
past
history
on
the
part
of
the
u.s.
the
united
states
is
saying
mr.
justice
that
now
in
19
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
not
now,
it's
24
miles.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
oh!
yes,
very
much
so.
they
say
so
in
this
case
that
the
line
shall
be
what
they
suggested
to
the
special
master
that
is
10
miles
and
they
have
said
so
in
the
case
that
they
have
filed
against
us
in
alaska
which
is
why
we're
appearing
here,
that
when
the
united
states
executive
extends
the
line
of
u.s.
inland
waters
outward
to
the
sea
as
they
have
done
now
that
it
does
not
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
states.
we
say
that
it
does
as
the
court
has
indicated
it
is.
thank
you.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
that's
correct
your
honor.
that's
the
u.s.
stand
and
that's
the
u.s.
position
and
here
is
why
i
think
it's
an
ill
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
yes.
because
the
submerged
lands
act
of
1953
doesn't
fix
any
lines
nor
does
it
enlarge
any
boundary
lines
of
the
states.
and
it
doesn't
do
it
for
this
reason
that
the
submerged
lands
act
was
enacted
for
one
purpose,
to
give
to
the
coastal
state
not
inland
waters.
it
wasn't
enacted
with
that
in
mind
but
to
give
them
this
body
of
water,
the
territorial
sea.
in
fact,
the
case
of
u.s.
versus
california
wasn't
even
concerned
with
inland
waters.
the
only
concern
of
that
case
was
title
for
this
here
and
so
the
submerged
lands
act
gave
back
to
the
several
states
this.
now,
the
submerged
lands
act
couldn't
constitutionally
operate
to
restrict
a
state's
boundaries
because
if
the
submerged
lands
act
operates
as
a
restriction
of
state's
boundaries
i
think
to
that
extent
it's
unconstitutional
and
it
can't
do
it.
for
instance,
your
honor,
let's
say,
here
is
a
bay
that
is
any
number
of
miles
wide
at
the
natural
entrance
point
and
that
in
1951
when
the
united
states
was
urging
10
miles
on
the
special
master,
i
want
to
say
this,
that
the
natural
entrance
point
is
11
miles.
now,
in
1951,
the
special
master
took
cognizance
of
this
matter
but
let's
say
the
10-mile
line
which
the
u.s.
was
insisting
on
as
the
one
that
would
demarcate
california
inland
waters
from
high
seas
which
is
at
that
time
u.s.
inland
waters
too,
the
distinction
10
miles.
now,
let's
say
that
in
time
accretion
occurred
here
and
narrowed
this
to
nine
miles.
now,
the
united
states
in
the
absence
of
the
submerged
lands
act
would
have
held
and
would
have
asked
the
special
master
to
find
this
line
demarcated
the
inland
waters
from
the
high
seas
but
now
the
united
states
since
the
passage
of
the
submerged
lands
act
says
this,
that
the
submerged
lands
act
operates
to
fix
the
inland
water
line
as
it
was
in
1953
and
let's
say
this
occurred,
this
operation
of
accretion
occurred
in
1955
and
that
in
‘53
it
was
11
miles.
if
the
united
states
is
correct,
here
is
the
line
that
california
must
now
have
as
a
result
of
the
submerged
lands
act
whereas
without
the
submerged
lands
act,
california's
boundary
would
have
gone
here
up
to
here.
in
other
words,
the
submerged
lands
act
operates
to
restrict
a
state's
boundaries
and
congress
cannot
restrict
state
boundaries
unless
the
state
legislature
agrees
to
do
so.
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
the
submerged
lands
act
didn't
grant
the
states
anything
but
this
three-mile
belt.
it
didn't
grant
them
any
title
to
inland
waters
already
considered
inland
and
within
their
territory
because
they
had
that
as
an
attribute
of
sovereignty.
they
had
that
since
pollard's
lessee
versus
hagan
at
least.
all
it
did
is
operate
on
this
and
it
did
not
operate
on
the
inland
waters.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no,
it
did
not
extend
seaward,
the
outer
boundaries
of
inland
waters.
it
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
inland
waters.
inland
waters
are
defined
by
something
different
and
apart
from
the
submerged
lands
act
and
their
location
has
nothing
to
do
with
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
i'm
sorry
about
a
what?
mr.
george
n.
hayes
on
this
point,
your
honor
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
on
this
point
it's
entirely
correct.
in
fact
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
that's
right.
in
fact
the
submerged
lands
act
quite
our
view
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
what
the
court
said
is
the
issue
is
the
issue
on
this
point,
what
is
a
bay?
and
what
happens
when
the
line
goes
further
out
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
submerged
lands
act?
and
i
think
the
court
has
presently
even
followed.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
it
does
today.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
by
recognizing
and
this
is
present
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states.
the
united
states
views
the
law
today
to
be
that
u.s.
inland
waters
are
now
closed
not
by
a
10-mile
line
but
by
a
24-mile
line.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
the
evidence
of
that
lies
in
expression
by
the
secretary
of
state,
there's
an
expression
of
that
in
a
letter
that
he
gave
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
which
was
to
be
filed
in
the
case
of
the
united
states
versus
alaska
in
the
district
court
in
alaska,
january
15,
1963
in
which
he
says
that
he
considers
that
the
24
miles
is
now
the
best
evidence
of
international
law
as
to
what
the
closure
line
between
inland
waters
and
high
seas
shall
be.
that's
exactly
why
the
case
was
brought
in
alaska
was
to
determine
this
one
in
single
point.
when
u.s.
inland
waters
in
large
it
does
it
in
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
states
and
we
say
that
past
precedent
has
it
that
it
does
and
if
there's
no
reason
to
change
past
precedent.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
the
united
states
of
america
versus
alaska.
that
was
filed
in
1963
in
the
summer
of
‘63
in
alaska.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
george
n.
hayes
yes,
it's
referred
too
in
our
brief.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no,
it
was
filed
in
the
district
court
in
alaska.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
yes,
sir.
united
states
filed
it
in
the
summer
of
1963
and
that's
why
we're
here.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
it's
now
in
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
the
district
court
decision
went
in
favor
the
united
states
at
the
bay
enlarger
when
the
--
when
this
line
went
out
that
it
became
u.s.
inland
waters
and
that
now
we
have
two
inland
waters.
one
u.s.
inland
waters
and
one
state
inland
waters
or
something
we've
never
held
before
but
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
yes.
that
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
i
think
if
they
go
back
to
10
miles
your
honor
we
have
to
recognize
this,
that
what
the
foreign
policy
of
this
executive
is
we're
bound
by
it
and
this
court
is
bound
by
it
and
when
the
executive
determines
that
whatever
the
title
be
in
the
state
or
even
the
united
states
to
seaward
lands
that
if
they
determine
that
the
full
enjoyment
of
those
rights
should
be
dropped
back
to
10
miles
or
5
miles
or
6
miles,
we
have
to
go
along
with
it.
and
i
think
this
point
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no,
it
doesn't.
it
doesn't
conflict
at
all
because
as
this
court
said
in
the
case
of
--
the
louisiana
case,
the
executive
has
the
full
power
to
determine
how
far
out
into
our
seaward
boundaries
any
particular
state
can
enjoy
its
rights
but
it
does
not
have
the
power
to
fix
those
boundaries,
only
congress
can
do
that.
and
as
a
corollary
to
that,
this
court
didn't
say
that
but
i'm
adding
it
because
it's
so
true
only
congress
has
the
power
to
fix
those
boundaries
and
of
course
this
court
in
the
interpretation
of
those
acts
of
congress
but
the
executive
cannot
fix
the
boundaries
but
they
definitely
can
fix
how
far
out
into
our
seaward
boundaries
we
can
enjoy
them.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
that
was
what
this
court
intended
by
that
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
your
honor,
unless
the
executive
acts
unconstitutionally,
yes.
the
executive
could
by
treaty,
the
executive
could
when
it
acts
constitutionally
within
its
sphere
of
foreign
policy
initiating
and
executing
foreign
policy
so
long
as
it
acts
constitutionally
and
they
have
great
latitude
in
that
can
do
quite
a
bit
in
the
way
of
restricting
our
enjoyment
of
rights
we
might
have
but
for
whatever
action
u.s.
executive
might
take.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
yes,
well,
whether
any
particular
act
that
is
constitutional
has
to
be.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
that
the
executive
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
i
think
there's
something
else
that
arises
here.
if
congress
--
if
congress
grants
to
a
state
certain
title
for
instance
it
has
no
power
over
that
again
to
take
it
back.
now,
if
by
the
exercise
of
some
other
power
it
has
over
the
state,
yes
it
may
but
simply
to
take
back
what
is
given
and
out
of
their
hands
is
going
to
be
a
pretty
difficult
thing
legally.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
yes,
it
is.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no,
if
your
honor
is
to,
just
as
thought
that
i
was
saying
this
and
i
think
that
you
are
correct
sir.
i
think
if
congress
just
assuming
no
bay
at
all,
the
difference
here
lies
in
the
fact
that
there
is
a
bay
and
that
bay
it
amounts
the
landlocked
waters,
locked
by
the
lands
of
one
sovereign
california
or
alaska.
now,
if
congress
attempted
to
simply
grant
and
here's
the
three-mile
line.
if
congress
attempted
to
simply
grant
the
state
of
california
lands
seaward
of
the
three-mile
line
without
extending
boundaries,
it
just
simply
grants
them
title
to
lands
underneath
the
sea
out
there.
do
i
make
myself
clear?
mr.
george
n.
hayes
yes,
it
could.
there
is
a
difference
your
honor
in
how
the
united
states
in
the
effect
of
the
united
states
dealings
with
foreign
countries
and
the
united
states
dealings
with
the
several
states
but
we're
saying
in
this
particular
type
of
instance
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
yes.
but
what
we're
saying
your
honor
is
that
according
to
established
domestic
law
that
in
the
case
of
bays
and
this
is
not
applicable
any
place
else,
not
applicable
in
the
high
seas
that
in
the
case
of
bays
that
when
that
line
is
extended
out
that
the
state's
jurisdiction
attaches
to
whatever
the
united
states
extends
it
to.
there
has
never
been
historically
any
difference.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
there
are
three
things
which
i
think
lead.
no,
there
are
no
cases
directly
on
that
point.
there
is
one
case
which
i
think
is
very
strong
and
very
important
and
there
are
two
other
developments
of
the
law
which
i
think
the
court
must
take
cognizance
of
in
declaring
what
has
been
the
law
in
this
country.
the
one
case
i
referred
to
is
manchester
versus
massachusetts
and
that
case
is
an
1890
case.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
yes,
it
is.
and
they
said
in
that
case
and
they
were
talking
about
buzzards
bay
and
buzzards
bay
is
bay
that
is
enclosed
by
a
line
less
than
six
miles
long
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
said
on
page
264
of
the
reporter,
“the
extent
of
a
territorial
jurisdiction
of
massachusetts
over
the
sea
adjacent
to
its
coast
is
that
of
an
independent
nation.”
now,
at
that
time
it
was
six
miles
and
your
honor
this
is
a
case
that
i
think
is
very
important.
it
isn't
by
itself
all
that
we
have.
the
united
states
government
recognized
the
truth
that
the
supreme
court
declared
in
this
case
because
in
1951,
it
didn't
insist
to
the
master
that
the
master
defined
the
inland
waters
at
6
miles
which
they
were
in
1850.
it
recognize
the
fact
that
when
the
u.s.
went
from
six
miles
to
10
miles
that
it
automatically
inured
to
the
benefit
of
the
states.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well,
no
10
because
there's
no
10
now.
10
is
meaningless
in
1964.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well,
i
think
we're
all
going
on
the
assumption
that
it
is.
i
may
be
an
error
i
think
the
u.s.
will
not
dispute
that.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
i'm
going
to
assume
that
u.s.
present
policy
is
that
there
is
no
10-mile
line.
they're
going
to
say
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
that's
right.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
that's
the
u.s.
position
and
we're
saying
there
isn't
even
any
against
us
today.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
this
is
what
they
say.
this
is
what
the
u.s.
say.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
well
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
they're
saying
it's
a
fixed
concept
as
of
the
time
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
we're
saying
that
the
submerged
lands
act
had
nothing
to
do
with
inland
waters
that
it
couldn't
have
it
would
be
unconstitutional
if
it
attempted
to
restrict
a
states
boundary.
they're
saying
oh
no
that
it
did
fix
that
line
at
10
miles
and
we're
saying
is
this
your
honor
that
the
law
has
developed
to
the
point
where
juridical
bays
do
inured
to
the
benefit
of
the
states
and
that
if.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
no,
i
think
if
probably
it
may
well
be
that
even
if
it
isn't
decided
in
this
case
certainly
a
circuit
court
will
look
very
much
to
what
this
court
says
in
10
miles.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
we
certainly
do
if
the
court
decides.
mr.
george
n.
hayes
if
this
court
decides
as
so
far
as
california
bays
are
concerned
and
the
california
act
of
admission
the
10-mile
applies,
we
certainly
hope
it
won't
say
that
and
so
far
as
alaska
bays
are
concerned
--
mr.
george
n.
hayes
--
because
there
may
be
a
difference.
the
other
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
your
honor,
the
u.s.
has
recognized
as
i
indicated
that
the
line
goes
out.
