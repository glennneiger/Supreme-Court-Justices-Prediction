mr.
keatinge?

(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
--
if
it
wanted,
as
you
said
here,
what
do
you
suggest
should
be
done
if
it
is
obsolete?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
view
then
that
assuming
--
assuming
that
one
should
agree
with
you
that
the
major
part
of
the
master's
report
was
no
longer
applicable
to
the
issues
remaining.
is
it
your
view
that,
now
i
gather
it
might
be,
that
the
proper
course
to
follow
would
be
to
appoint
another
master
and
have
him
consider
it
anew
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
issues
after
they
are
raised
--
after
they
are
fixed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course,
i
suppose
that
we
would
have
fixed
the
boundaries
finally
different
to
the
way
congress
ultimately
decided
it
more
than
fix
so
far
as
the
united
states
is
concerned
that
it
could
surrender
back
whatever
land
it
wanted
to
as
it
did
before.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much
is
that
(inaudible)
water?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
just
approximate.
considerably
more
isn't
it
with
california?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
alright.
what
is
the
basis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
legal
basis,
which
contribute
to
abandon
the
old
and
adopt
the
new?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
that
if
we
give
them
a
chance,
but
then
if
we
give
the
government,
we
would
ultimately
give
the
government
less
than
it
thinks
what
it
asked
and
that
is
less
than
you
want,
congress
would
have
divided
it
and
give
it
back
to
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
been
anything
presented
to
congress
by
either
you
or
the
united
states
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
connection
with
this
matter
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
any
other
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me
reading
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
making
your
side
depend
entirely
on
an
interpretation
of
the
submerged
land
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
they
would
get
back
finally
to
submerge
land
act
on
which
you
claim
is
read?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
same
thing
is
true
with
reverence
to
the
first
california
case,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we've
passed
on
what
was
a
three-mile
belt,
who
had
paramount
rights
over
that
outside
the
state
boundary
line,
whatever
it
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
didn't
try
to
define
inland
waters
was,
and
we
wouldn't
have
to
put
in
that
belt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
time
is
up
but
there's
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
hope
that
leads
to
a
phase
that
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
meant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'll
be
unable
to
give
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
suppose
it
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
of
course
--
of
course,
that's
(inaudible)
boundary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
not
go
to
united
states
(inaudible)
united
states'
territories.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
but
what
we
--
what
we
left
unsolved
i
thought
is
(inaudible)
both
rivers
that
ran
along
the
water
and
ran
along
the
land.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
agree
to
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
even
though
you
contend
international
relation
but
what
i'm
talking
about
by
the
whole
discretion
thing.
going
off
(inaudible)
it
was
going
on
the
basis
that
the
waters
in
the
inland
didn't
have
to
be
inside
the
boundaries
of
the
state.
(inaudible)
they
can
have
inside
the
land
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
was
included.
all
i
can
have
(inaudible)
and
i
have
--
i
have
done
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
i
get
back
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
later.
could
it
have
done
(inaudible)
the
boundary
of
the
state
recognized
to
give
to
the
states
(inaudible)
that
was
the
boundary
of
the
state
that
congress
had
in
effect
purpose
of
taking
from
it
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
legal
boundary
before
1953
for
this
one
place
that
congress
taken
away
by
then.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
less.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
got
to
get
to
see
what
it
was
then
and
that's
to
determine
whether
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
act
mentioned
political
boundaries?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
looked
at
it.
i
was
just
wondering
you
have
mentioned
that
word
anyway.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
recall
using
the
word
political
boundaries
in
the
california
case,
did
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
would
devastate
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
consider
that
as
your
main
responsibility?
justice
hugo
l.
black
being
--
being
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
part
of
the
ocean
or
to
the
landlocked
bay?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
drew
a
distinction
which
i
have
--
i
don't
want
to
bring
it
back
to
the
subject.
we
drew
what
i
felt
was
very
clearly
statute
in
the
between
water,
land
under
the
ocean,
land
under
--
land
locked
bay
pointing
to
the
facts.
we
were
not
deciding
though
about
the
landlocked
bay
and
if
the
power
of
the
government
extended
only
when
it
got
into
this
sea
itself.
that
was
the
external
power
of
the
government.
now,
i
was
wondering
are
you
arguing
that
there's
no
evidence
would
be
admissible.
i
think
you
are
to
show
that
during
all
these
years,
this
line
has
been
considered
to
come
along
the
land
up
to
the
point
where
the
bay
and
could
join
and
then
crossover
the
bay
over
to
the
place
by
the
land
and
could
join
it
on
the
other
side.
could
that
evidence
could
not
be
admissible?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
think
it,
if
it
could
be
admissible
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
don't
want
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
going
--
are
you
going
to
argue
what
would
be
the
government's
position
if
you
are
wrong
on
your
major
premise
that
this
was
not
inland
waters?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
going
to
argue
--
do
you
have
to
defend
on
the
act,
the
act
which
gave
away
the
land?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
--
did
they
attempt
at
all
to
define
what
was
the
--
are
you
going
to
decide
this
line,
ancient
line
of
california
which
was
california
within
its
territorial
limits?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
all
these
differences
between
coast
line
and
political
line
and
so
forth
but
i
find
nothing
about
politically,
something
about
territorial
line.
but
if
this
was
in
the
territory
of
california,
is
it
your
claim
that
congress
took
it
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
we
held
in
united
states
against
california
was
that
the
state
did
not
own
any
land
underneath
the
ocean,
underneath
the
sea.
we
pointed
out
to
that
particularly
had
to
belong
to
this
government
to
take
care
of
the
foreign
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
left
open
the
question
of
inland
waters
specifically.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
did
if
pollard
was
correct.
after
which
we
pointed
out.
as
i
recall
pollard
was
out
mobile,
alabama,
the
fact
at
the
same
kind
of
an
inland
water
officiated,
did
officiated
in
inland
water,
is
there
a
little
difference
between
as
i've
see
it?
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
i
have
is
that
--
if
as
to
whether,
frankly,
the
master
should
consider
this
to
determine
whether
this
was
a
part
of
the
well
recognized
ancient,
historical,
territorial
boundary
of
california
at
the
time
it
became
a
city.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
depend
on
this
act
over
congress
giving
away
part
of
the
land.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
told
you
what's
being
as
i
understand
it.
well,
i
don't
know
--
well,
i
don't
know
how
this
case
would
go.
i
have
no
idea,
i
--
i
am
myself
and
yet,
but
your
--
your
argument
is
as
i
understand
it,
the
line
of
california
goes
along
the
land
and
when
it
gets
to
a
landlocked
bay,
such
as
this
or
any
other,
landlocked
bay.
but
then,
just
into
the
land
and
follows
the
land
rather
than
following
going
through
the
landlocked
border.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
that
this
argument
that
the
master
made
that
finding
and
that
it
supported
by
united
states,
is
that
the
argument
really
you're
making
the
here
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happened
to
the
islands
then
how
they've
been
operating,
who's
operating
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
i
was
asking
about
that
because
you
referring
to
these
facts,
now
they
are?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
do
you
asking
us
to
do
with
reference
to
this
report?
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
that
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
those
bays?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
base
on
--
is
that
based
on
asking
us
to
view
the
facts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
saying
--
you're
saying
in
this
fact
to
the
determination
was
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
one
is
here?
