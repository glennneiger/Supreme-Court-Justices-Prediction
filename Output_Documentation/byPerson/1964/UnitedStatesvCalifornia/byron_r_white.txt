justice
byron
r.
white
now,
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
is
california's
claim
are
you
relying
on
the
carrillo
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
about
that
red
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
abandoned
that
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you've
abandoned
the
red
line.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
have
given
that
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
this
historic
--
the
act
not
only
is
thinking
of
the
outer
boundaries
of
the
territorial
waters
in
terms
historical
boundaries
but
historical
boundary
--
history
should
be
resorted
to
determine
the
beginning.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
outer
land
to
determine
the
outer
limits
of
inland
water.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
--
you
think
then
isn't
there
some
suggestion
that
the
idea
of
historic
boundaries
was
in
congress'
mind
because
of
the
situation
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
then
they
had
in
mind
the
historical
--
some
historic
basis
for
extending
beyond
some
three-mile
limit
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
without
anything,
is
there
some
evidence
they
have
in
mind
ascertaining
the
end
of
the
inland
waters
based
on
the
historical?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you're
wrong
on
your
historic
side?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
you're
wrong
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
keatinge,
your
historic
argument
though
and
constitutional
argument,
though
a
good
deal
part
of
this
deal
with
--
deal
with
the
subsurface
where
the
land
that
meet
the
waters.
i
would
assume
that
if
your
argument
is
any
good
worth
anything
at
all,
it
means
that
these
are
inland
water
and
decide
these
dotted
red
line
is
on
your
map.
it's
had
great
many
implications
over
and
beyond
the
question
of
what
oil
may
be
to
meet
the
surface.
and
in
that
respect,
it
seems
to
me
--
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
say
the
international
relations
of
united
states
are
wholly
irrelevant
with
such
ideas.
it's
not
a
good
deal.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
--
so
congress
--
so
you
say
congress
did
accept
then,
the
statement
of
the
court
in
western
california
in
the
sense
that
united
states
owned
the
territorial
waters
that
the
were
an
issue
in
that
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
congress
accepted
that
but
then
it
turned
around
and
gave
it
back.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
it
didn't
give
back
any
waters,
it
gave
back
the
subsoil?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
i'm
just
trying
to
get
to
the
--
if
congress
accepted
--
if
congress
accepted
the
court's
decision
and
you
ask
the
united
states
against
california
332
u.s.
or
whatever
it
was
and
then
turned
around
and
said,
we're
going
to
give
a
certain
major
of
the
subsoil
back.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
starts
from
the
part
they're
giving
back,
starts
from
the
premises
of
332
u.s.,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
under
that
decision
--
under
that
decision,
you
think
you
would
be
making
these
kinds
of
arguments?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
make
those
kinds
of
arguments
in
the
california
or
did
you
have
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
would
they
be
any
--
why
would
they
be
any
good
at
all
in
u.s.
district
of
california?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
there
some
--
i
thought
it
has
something
to
say
under
your
brief
and
government
that
congress
thought
it
was
just
leaving
this
question
exactly
where
it
founded
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
could
determine
just
as
they
were
navigable
--
where
the
shoreline
was
or
what
the
outer
boundaries
in
the
--
in
the
matter
it
was,
is
to
be
determined
is
as
though
there
had
never
been
a
submerged
land
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
said
that
we're
going
to
leave
it
where
we
found
it
without
choosing
upsides
on
any
of
these
theories.
justice
byron
r.
white
including
choosing
upsides
between
historic
and
international
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
absent
the
submerged
land
act
and
i
don't
suppose
it
was
your
position
to
remain
the
same.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
historical
argument
gains,
you
think
gains
--
gains
its
strength
from
the
submerged
land
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
didn't
gain
any
strength
or
this
--
there
weren't
submerged
lands?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
have
--
and
you
should
--
the
original
exceptions
accepted
that
approach,
you
would
have
modified
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
i
gather
making
an
argument
here
that
based
on
the
history
in
your
constitution
that
these
waters,
these
are
--
the
waters
inside
those
lines
you've
been
referring
to
are
inland
waters.
these
are
the
boundaries
of
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
constitutionally,
yes
and
you
can't
deny,
i
suppose,
then
that
the
inland
--
that
boundary
is
the
boundary
between
the
inland
waters
and
international
waters?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
that's
what
you're
saying
but
the
evidence
here
is
--
the
doctrine
of
the
evidence
and
the
reference
that
you're
giving
us
are
determining
not
only
a
wholly
domestic
matter
that
the
land
underneath
the
water
but
police
jurisdiction
and
everything
else,
you're
saying
these
are
inland
waters.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
that's
a
wholly
circular
argument
because
that
exception
in
section
6
never
applies
that
these
were
inland
waters.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
whatsoever
but
the
only
--
that
is
only
assumption
and
that
provides
though
assumes
that
the
land
which
is
being
given
to
the
state
lies
outside
inland
waters
because
if
it
doesn't
the
proviso
has
no
application
whatsoever
if
these
were
inland
waters,
if
it
was
in
the
police
power
of
the
state,
if
it
was
in
the
police
jurisdiction
of
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
that
in
the
part
of
united
states
to
recognize
that
the
inland
waters
of
the
state
were
subject
to
change
or
their
boundaries
were
to
change?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i'm
just
saying
that
isn't
very
clear
--
i
don't
understand
why
united
states
that
if
we're
going
to
take
that
we
could
argue
that
all
of
states
having
the
six-mile
closure,
i
would
think
the
united
states
could
well
recognize
that
inland
that
that's
the
idea
of
the
bay
of
the
changing
concept,
that
it
changes
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
enlarges
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
think
the
united
states
is
saying
10
miles
because
that
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
if
the
--
not
as
regards
of
--
it
has
never
implemented
this
matter
has
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
nor
did
it
extend
seaward,
the
outer
boundaries
of
the
inland
waters.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
be
that
wholly
aside
from
the
--
there
is
this
issue
wholly
aside
from
the
submerge
lands
act
as
to
what
should
be
the
consequence
of
an
evolving
idea
about
bay?
justice
byron
r.
white
about
a
bay.
wholly
aside
from
the
submerged
lands
act
there
is
this
issue
of
what
should
be
the
effect
of
changing
ideas
of
what
a
juridical
bay.
it
might
be
10
miles
some
time
and
20
miles
some
other
time
and
that
is
an
issue
with
this
case
i
gather.
justice
byron
r.
white
wholly
coincides
with
submerged
lands
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
had
the
same
argument
that
there
had
ever
been
a
submerged
land.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
remain
--
the
point
of
the
united
states
of
america
what
it
said
by
treaty
has
never
exercised
any
jurisdiction
or
attempted
to
as
against
foreign
countries
over
any
waters
outside
the
10
mile
closure
line.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
it
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
that
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
suit
are
you
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
referred
too
in
your
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
an
original
case
here
or?
justice
byron
r.
white
between
united
states
and
alaska.
justice
byron
r.
white
an
alternative
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
i
--
well,
--
all
the
appellate
steps
have
not
been
finished
yet.
the
u.s.
hasn't
submitted
its
brief
so
i
don't
know
if
it's
being
held.
but
it's
there.
it's
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
reconciling
the
two
positions
that
earlier
so
whatever
the
boundaries
were
of
a
state
constitutes
where
the
congress
can't
affect
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
it
wasn't
the
executive.
suppose
congress
will
adopt
the
law
which
extended
this
definition
of
bay
for
24
miles.
suppose
that
was
imbedded
in
congressional
legislation
then
later
congress
appealed
that
and
moved
it
back
to
10
miles.
could
congress
constitutionally
to
do
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
your
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
isn't
that
--
you're
putting
something
into
the
case.
assume
that
congress
does
just
happen
to
grant
a
strip
of
land
with
the
water
over
it
to
the
states
and
thereby
say
this
is
now
part
of
your
--
of
the
state
land
but
what
about
it
does
is
say
to
foreign
countries
as
regards
our
relations
with
you
just
consider
the
24-mile
line
the
division
between
yours
and
ours.
now,
that
sort
of
an
act
is
a
wholly
different
thing
than
the
grant
of
the
state,
the
grant
by
congress
to
a
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you're
saying
though
that
just
the
mere
recognition
of
the
united
states
of
the
24-mile
line
as
against
foreign
countries
automatically
renounced
the
benefit
of
the
state
just
as
though
congress
had
granted
the
land
to
the
states
and
i
think
those
are
rather
different
things.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
think
you're
reaching
what
i
was
talking
about.
it
may
not
have
been
very
clear
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
--
let's
just
assume
for
the
moment
that
was
wholly
clear
between
the
state
in
the
united
states
what
the
closing
line
for
a
bay
was.
and
say
it
was
six
miles,
everybody
agreed
that's
what
a
bay
is,
and
then
the
united
states,
the
next
year
said
to
the
foreign
country,
domestically
we
have
a
rule
of
six
miles
but
for
international
purposes,
we're
going
to
move
that
line
out
24
miles
and
that
will
be
considered
our
territorial
water.
you're
suggesting
that
automatically
and
ipso
facto,
the
state's
boundaries
are
moved
out
to
the
24-mile
line
just
as
though
the
united
states
have
not
only
said
to
foreign
countries
we're
moving
in
a
line
out
24
miles
but
congress
had
enacted
the
law
which
is
said
we
are
hereby
granting
to
you
the
following
described
territory
which
takes
the
six-mile
line
up
to
24-mile
line
up.
you're
saying
the
two
cases
are
exactly
the
same,
right
that
there
may
be
a
difference
between
the
united
states
position
is
against
foreign
countries
and
the
united
states
position
is
against
the
state,
that
the
state
and
the
united
states
could
very
well
retain
its
position
as
regard
to
the
state
and
confine
the
state
to
six-mile
line
whereas
with
regards
to
foreign
countries
it
deals
in
the
24-mile
closing
line
limit?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
very
necessary
part
of
the
state
of
california's
arguments
that
is
that
there
is
a
difference
from
domestic
and
in
foreign.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you've
never
--
there
aren't
any
cases
like
that,
are
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
saying
at
the
united
states
wants
to
give
the
states
wants
to
recognize
the
states
right
up
to
10
miles
it
must
also
recognize
about
24
miles.
that's
either
six
or
24
but
no
10.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
hope
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it's
meaningless
i
suppose
you
win
your
case
but
the
united
states
is
meaningful
enough
for
you
to
lose
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there's
no
10-mile
line
--
there's
no
10-mile
line
if
we
get
to
foreign
countries.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
that's
still
remains
with
these
standards.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
don't
ask
for
any
detailed
answer
at
all.
are
these
used
in
the
louisiana
case
somewhat
somewhere
to
those
here
or
are
they
related
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
this
section
and
mr.
solicitor
general
the
assumption
behind
the
limitation
is
that
the
submerged
lands
act
did
intend
to
proceed
on
the
historical
boundaries
or
at
least
there
was
a
danger
that
it
would
be
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
historical
argument
then
would
--
the
state
could
claim
that
historically
you
could
go
out
in
the
ocean
forever
but
also
it
you
claim
that
historically
its
coastline
was
in
a
certain
place.
justice
byron
r.
white
whatever
its
--
whatever
its
boundaries
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
just
suggesting
though
that
seaward
limit
of
inland
waters
might
pick
up
a
good
deal
and
meaning
from
the
history
and
the
congress
intended
to
recognize
the
historical
boundaries
of
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
would
move
--
well
it
--
all
it
would
do
is
move
the
line,
the
beginning
line
out
from
three
miles?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be
true
if
the
state
were
claiming
historic
boundary
out
in
the
ocean
but
what
if
it
just
says
look
our
boundary
was
always
our
coastline,
our
boundary
has
been
nothing
but
our
coastline.
we
have
never
claimed
anything
out
there
but
all
we're
saying
is
that
now
that
congress
has
given
us
the
three
miles
out
in
the
ocean
we
claim
the
major
from
our
historic
boundaries.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
that's
california's
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
can
be
a
historic
boundary.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
executive
could
roll
back
the
harbor's
definition
to
six
miles
instead
ten?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
is
question
that
has
been
rolled
out
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
have
a
weak
point
at
the
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
said
that
you
have
weak
point
at
the
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.

white
ownership
of
the
island.
