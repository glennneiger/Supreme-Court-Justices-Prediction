justice
john
m.
harlan
there
were
all
a
series
of
quick
claim
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
started
in
â€˜45
and
finally
culminated
in
'53.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
to
decide
this
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
we
are
dealing
there
with
seaward
boundary
and
here
the
question
is
where
you
measure
whatever
the
three-mile
granted
--
the
three-mile
grant
in
this
case
is
going
to
be
--
and
that's
the
question
we
didn't
touch
on.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
saying
that
the
principles
that
were
established
in
that
page
may
not
be
germane
but
certainly
it
did
not
decide
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
keatinge,
can
you
tell
me
roughly,
the
total
area
involved
in
this
dispute.
i
mean
acreage-wise.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
don't
bother,
i'll
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you
say
is
that
the
united
states
an
excess
of
largest,
you
are
to
give
the
states
the
entire
continental
shelf
200
miles
out.
if
you
do,
that
will
do
a
lot
of
rippled
effect
on
its
foreign
relations.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
there's
certainly
not
that
much
in
louisiana.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
certainly
know
that
much
in
louisiana.
justice
john
m.
harlan
has
these
problems
arise
--
i
don't
know
what
happened
as
an
aftermath
in
the
texas
case.
do
you
have
this
problem
in
the
texas
case?
has
there
been
a
subsequent
litigation
where
you
might
hear
the
cause
now
and
completely
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
alright.
i
(inaudible)
take
your
time.
perhaps
you
could
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
position
of
united
states
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
nothing
to
do
with
this
i
would
think
that
was
the
whole
thing.
justice
john
m.
harlan
at
the
same
time
the
question
is
what
congress
is
what
the
purpose
of
congress
was
assuming
that
basic
premise
regarding
the
certs
and
that
is
the
historic
boundaries
in
sense
that
california
that
the
limit
that
it
did
apply
wasn't
the
yardstick
that
congress
can
even
measure
these
submerged
lands
rights
by
--
submerged
rights
by
and
this
question
notes
the
question
of
intent.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
they
intended
was
to
be
an
ambulatory
concept
or
fixed
standard
as
of
the
time
they
grant
the
submerged
lands
act.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
question
that
concerns
you
and
i
can
see
why
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
decide
it
in
this
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
want
us
to
keep
our
minds
open
on
that
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
influence
this
court
of
appeals.
justice
john
m.
harlan
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
were
there
any
references
mr.
solicitor
general
to
the
special
master's
report
as
such?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
at
this
point.
your
premise
is
that
the
rights
determined
on
your
premises
are
to
be
determined
as
of
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
justice
john
m.
harlan
rather
than
at
the
time
that
the
litigation
of
the
dispute
arises.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i'm
getting
at
is
this,
if
united
states
now
taking
international,
what
i
mean,
the
executive
view
of
what
international
law
on
this
field
is,
if
the
submerged
land
act
had
been
passed
today,
you'd
been
arguing
for
24-mile?
justice
john
m.
harlan
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
therefore,
if
the
treaty
it
gave
rise
to
the
24-mile
limit
have
been
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
submerged
land
act,
likewise
it
would
have
been
a
24-mile
inland
water
that
the
attitude
of
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
we've
done
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i
am
wondering
is
whether
the
concept
that
you
are
arguing
for
isn't
an
off
the
original
on
whether
congress
acted
with
that
rigidity
or
whether
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
at
least
--
at
least
the
condition
of
the
affairs
as
respect
at
the
time
of
litigation
when
the
dispute
arose
is
isn't
a
more
realistic
test
and
the
one
that
you're
suggesting.
justice
john
m.
harlan
alright.
thank
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
was
this
--
i
asked
you,
did
they
accepted
defense
department
point
of
view?
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
ask
you
this
point,
if
the
case
is
going
to
be
decided
on
the
premises
that
you're
arguing
now
which
is
california's
premise,
wouldn't
this
have
to
go
back
to
our
master?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
realized
that,
but
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
are
they
on
the
brief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you
squeeze
more
out
of
those
cases
than
this
rather?
justice
john
m.
harlan
right.
