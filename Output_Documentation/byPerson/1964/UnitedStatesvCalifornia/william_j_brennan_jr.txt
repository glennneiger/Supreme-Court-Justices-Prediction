justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
about
the
submerged
lands
act,
how
far
that
legislation
was
addressed
at
the
time
that
the
special
master
continued
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
was
it
under
consideration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
congress
--
did
congress
have
a
--
drafted
this
report
before?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
here
the
red
line
in
california's
claim
is
not
based
as
i
understand
it
under
the
definition
of
a
bay
whether
on
10-mile
basis
or
otherwise
but
on
the
position
that
everything
within
that
is
inland
waters?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
you
measured
three
miles
seaward
of
the
dotted
line,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
--
that
being
the
outer
limit
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
and
you
go
three
miles
seaward
of
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
why
do
you
draw
that
point
from
point
dume
to
point
vicente?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
this
is
history
again
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
california
constitution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
with
that
citing,
there's
no
money
over
the
last
several
years
which
the
united
states
and
california
contest
in
present.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
do
you
--
as
a
practical
matter
--
as
a
practical
matter,
does
that
mean,
for
example,
it
was
the
surface
board
or
perhaps
even
the
fishing
line,
might
be
regulable
by
the
federal
government
even
though
the
subsoil
belonged
to
the
state
of
california?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
was
that
evidence
and
fact
then
indicates
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
what
you're
telling
that
he
didn't
evaluate
i
gather
because
of
the
premise
that
on
which
he
proceeded
with
which
as
i
recall
it,
california
originally
agreed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
did,
and
i
get
your
exceptions
now.
what
you're
telling
us
is
that
you
abandoned
that
agreement
or
perhaps
not
abandoned
it
but
it's
no
longer
relevant
you
say
because
the
submerged
lands
act
proceeding
on
a
different
premise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
may
i
get
back
to
mr.
justice
goldberg's
question,
you
actually
did
put
in,
i
gather,
a
great
deal
of
this
data.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although,
he
rejected
it
and
therefore
didn't
evaluate
it.
that
is
in
his
affidavit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
--
would
there
be
still
more
if
i
had
to
be
sending
this
back
to
the
second
master,
would
there
still
more
in
addition
of
evidence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
this
have
an
affect
on
boundary
in
your
view
on
the
boundary
of
the
state?
does
your
position
have
anything
to
do
when
they
go
to
24
miles?
does
this
make
the
boundary
of
the
state
further
up?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
happens
if
they
go
back
to
10
miles?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
action
wouldn't
fall
within
your
suggestion
earlier
that
any
effort
of
the
united
states
will
affect
the
boundaries
of
the
state
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
in
your
brief,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
mr.
cox
,
do
we
get
the
problem
of
getting
oil
in
deep
waters?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
depends
on
where
the
coastline.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
just
used
the
dark
blue
and
the
seven
segments.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
could
be
that
the
california
might
not
take
you
generous
enough.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
many
light
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
something
that
looks
like
bay
for
example
just
above
san
luis
obispo
bay.
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
even
the
government's
generosity
may
not
be
generous
enough.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
before
you
leave
map
will
you
be
coming
during
the
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
do
it
now
because
the
pink
--
the
light
pink
and
the
significance
and
so
forth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
--
yes,
i
noticed
the
caption
is
that
this
will
result
in
a
straight
baseline
principle.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
isn't
--
unless
there
was
only
application
of
that
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
a
question
mr.
solicitor.
as
i
understand
both
the
united
states
and
california
agreed
on
the
master's
place
of
committee
at
the
time
of
the
original
report?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i
say
that
only
because
we
have
here
the
exception
--
california's
exceptions
of
52
or
53.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at
is,
did
that
reflect
do
you
know
any
understanding
of
decisions
of
this
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
it
did,
what
decision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
really
getting
at
is
this,
mr.
justice
black
said
in
the
initial
case
speaking
of
collard.
in
doing
so
it
has
used
the
language
strong
enough
to
indicate.
the
court
then
believes
that
states
not
only
own
titled
lands
of
soil
but
the
navigable
inland
waters
but
also
owned
soil
under
all
navigable
waters
within
their
territorial
jurisdiction
whether
inland
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
any
--
well,
i'll
come
back
to
the
question
on
that,
surely
you're
not
going
to
find
anything
in
this,
are
you,
in
this
decision
which
suggest
that
leaving
this
problem
where
the
court
left
it,
meant
leaving
it
in
the
premise
that
the
master
made,
a
premise
with
which
both
you
and
california
then
agreed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
do.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
do
you
suggest
then
that
this
was
really
the
understanding
which
lead
to
the
agreement
on
the
basic
premise
of
the
map.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
as
i
understand
that
act
(inaudible)
the
shoreward
of
that
line.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
within
that
line,
is
that
what
the
congress
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
perhaps,
i'm
--
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
in
some
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they're
just
traffic
rules.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
notice
from
the
(inaudible),
you
don't
rely
on
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
cox,
what
remains
in
the
way
that
--
something
further
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
lower?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
wrong.
i'm
very
sorry.
he
said
it
was
the
average
of
all
lows
of
the
lower
of
the
two
tides,
lower
low
as
it
is
called.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
either
to
control
this
boundary
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
if
these
boggs
formula
might
not
be
appropriate
formula
to
semi-circles?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
the
special
master
replied
the
boggs
formula?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
why
we
accept
this
essentially.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
bays?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
to
remember
that
we
did
not
deal
with
the
other
possible
problem
but
it
is
done
in
this
case
namely
even
with
respect
with
it
pro
--
relief
to
the
matter
where
you
how
measure
that
relief.
