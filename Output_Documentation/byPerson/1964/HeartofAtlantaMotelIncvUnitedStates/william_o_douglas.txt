we're
talking
here
about
--
currently
about
a
person
moving
into
interstate
commerce.
justice
william
o.
douglas
driving
from
virginia
to
atlanta
and
asking
accommodations
for
a
night,
now
that
is
in
interstate
commerce.
the
person
is
moving
into
interstate
commerce.
you
don't
treat
in
your
brief
that
point
precisely
as
i
read
your
brief.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
don't
refer
to
the
mann
act
cases?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
said
people
are
not
commerce,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
it
is
somewhat
new,
at
least
as
i
read
the
cases
to
the
extent
that
it
involves
a
requirement
that
this
motel
served
a
local
person
who
hasn't
moved
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
william
o.
douglas
(inaudible)
that
before,
you
could
really
appeal
to
the
state
actions
provisions
of
the
statute,
cite
now
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
itself.
it
has
to
be
facts
developed
which
quotes
you
within
the
definition?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
if
one
more
uncomfortable?
justice
william
o.
douglas
was
it
here
more
uncomfortable,
i
gather
arguing,
if
they
had
a
record.
justice
william
o.
douglas
alright.
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
you
start
your
commerce
argument,
would
you
just
take
a
minute
to
--
the
apparent
inconsistency
between
201
(b)
and
201
(c)
(1)?
201
(b)
says
that
it
is
a
place
of
public
accommodation,
if
its
operations
affect
commerce.
and
in
c,
it
says
that
if
is
a
motel,
it
does
affect
commerce.
are
we
dealing
here
with
a
conclusive
presumption
that
a
motel
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
fact
as
i
call
it
in
this
case
was
75%
of
the
transient
from
out
of
state
--
in
other
words,
would
you
be
making
this
argument
of
100%
of
the
transience
for
the
residents
of
georgia?
justice
william
o.
douglas
(inaudible)
--
sincerely
interstate.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
i
want
to
be
clear.
let's
assume
that
the
government's
position
is
that
it's
irrelevant
whether
the
transient
as
long
as
they
are
transients
or
interstate
travelers.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
--
unless
you've
suggested
anyway
that
perhaps
that's
not
subject
or
legitimate
inquiry
for
us,
but
what
does
this
record
show?
is
it
necessarily
that
--
with
racial
discrimination
in
this
context
that
was
the
basic
objective
of
the
legislation?
or
is
it
also
susceptible
or
as
i
thought,
you
suggested
earlier
that
there
are
obstructions
to
commerce
and
serious
obstructions
to
the
free-flow
of
commerce
which
they
may
have
a
racial
basis
but
that
is
the
evil
at
which
the
legislation
is
saying.
