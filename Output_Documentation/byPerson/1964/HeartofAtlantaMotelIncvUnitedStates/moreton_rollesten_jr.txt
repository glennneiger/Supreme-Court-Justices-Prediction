mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
the
court
had
instructed
us
to
file
a
brief
the
same
time
we
filed
a
jurisdiction
statement,
it’s
the
only
brief
on
either
question.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
final
judgment
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
georgia,
atlanta
division,
which
was
heard
before
a
three-judge
court.
on
a
complaint
filed
by
the
appellant
herein,
he
was
a
plaintiff
below,
seeking
to
declare
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
un-constitutional
and
seeking
a
permanent
injunction
against
the
united
states
and
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
at
that
time,
mr.
kennedy,
from
enforcing
that
act
against
the
appellant.
the
government
filed
not
only
an
answer
for
the
counterclaim,
and
in
the
counterclaim,
asked
for
an
injunction
out
of
provisions
for
the
civil
rights
act
against
the
appellant.
the
case
was
heard
and
decision
rendered
on
the
counterclaim
of
the
government
and
the
permanent
injunction
was
granted
against
the
appellant
and
any
officers
or
agents
set
forth.
we
--
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
your
honor,
we
filed
a
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court,
it
was
actually
received
by
judge
hoffman,
chief
justice
of
the
fifth
circuit,
convened
a
three-judge
court
on
his
motion.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
the
government
filed
such
a
certificate,
on
the
present
judge
totally
convened
the
court
himself.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
before
they
even
asked
us
about
this.
now,
the
facts
in
this
case
are
very
simple.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
(inaudible)
tried
to
make
it
simple.
they
are
made
by
the
pleadings
and
the
answer
to
the
pleadings,
and
a
short
stipulation
facts,
and
these
generally
in
briefly
are
the
facts.
the
heart
of
atlanta
motel
corporate
is
georgia
corporation
owned
a
motel
in
line
of
name,
the
heart
of
atlanta
motel.
it
is
the
only
business
that
it
operates.
it's
the
only
business
it
has
in
atlanta.
the
motel
has
216
rooms,
it
is
located
in
downtown
atlanta
and
fronting
on
the
interstate
highway.
by
stipulation,
we
agreed
that
over
75%
of
all
the
business,
in
the
form
of
guests
coming
from
out
of
the
state
of
georgia,
than
most
of
the
convention
business
is
listed
out
in
the
state
of
georgia,
there
we
have
highway
billboards
on
roads
in
georgia.
there
was
nothing
in
the
stipulations
about
a
restaurant
because
we
brought
the
suit
in
the
name
of
the
corporation.
the
restaurant
in
the
motel
is
operated
by
a
lessee.
the
government
in
their
counterclaim
included
the
lessee
but
later
dismissed
them
because
they
determined
as
a
matter
of
fact,
after
the
facets
of
the
act,
the
lessee
was
complying
with
that.
but
the
--
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
the
lessee
of
the
restaurant
was
complying
with
the
act,
they
are
lessee
in
our
premises.
somewhat
in
part
and
end
of
the
case
because
also
the
alabama
case
far
in
this
one,
there
is
a
arresting
involved
but
not
in
this
particular
case,
but
the
--
low
applicable
is
interested
in
--
and
applicable
to
us
because
eventually
it
will
apply
to
our
restaurant
too
even
though
it
is
a
lessee.
and
i
think
those
all
are
facts.
i
think
it
comes
squarely
under
the
law,
under
the
law
as
proposed
by
congress,
now,
we
have
attempted
to
--
and
have
attacked
the
constitutionality
of
title
2
of
the
act,
which
is
probably
the
accommodation
section.
although,
our
petition
to
make
it
perfectly
clear,
says
that
the
act
itself,
the
whole
act
will
fall
for
the
same
reason
we
think
title
2
will
fall.
now
title
2
of
the
public
accommodation
section,
it
really
got
two
parts
in
making
a
difference
in
this
hearing.
the
one
that
applies
to
motel
just
says,
categorically
that
all
motels
and
all
hotels
are
picked
in
the
state
commerce.
they
do
it
in
a
devious
way.
they
say,
that
these
establishments
listed
here
and
after
which
affect
the
interstate
commerce
are
covered
by
this
act.
and
then
on
the
second
paragraph
list
motels
as
well
as
a
lot
of
other
things,
and
in
this
thing,
at
the
end
of
our
list
and
above
paragraph
therefore,
affects
interstate
commerce
and
therefore
is
covered
by
the
act.
but
in
substance
it
says,
every
motel
in
the
united
states,
all
65
of
them,
all
affect
interstate
commerce.
the
other
part
of
the
act
which
i
referred
to
a
minute
ago
about
a
restaurant,
says
that
any
restaurant
that
serves
or
offers
to
serve
food
in
interstate
travel,
all
who
serves
food
to
a
substantial
portion,
which
it
had
already
moved
interstate
commerce
is
covered
by
the
act.
there
is
a
distinction
because
the
restaurant
is
a
factual
situation.
it's
conceivable
that
you
could
find
in
favor
of
a
restaurant
in
this
case
and
against
a
motel
but
not
vice
versa.
because
i
believe
each
restaurant
will
stand
on
the
factual
situation
of
that
restaurant,
whether
it
serves
the
interstate
commerce
travelers
or
where
a
substantial
portion
of
food
passes
in
commerce,
as
already
passed
in
commerce
which
they
use
if
those
will
stand
up.
but
as
to
a
motel,
the
portion
that
we
are
primarily
interested
in
is
the
portion
that
says
that
all
motels
regardless,
our
part
of
interstate
commerce,
all
affect.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
no
sir,
it
list
motels
and
it
list
hotels
in
the
act.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
there
is
all
exception
which
doesn't
apply
of
course
if
it's
realistic.
the
owner
lives
in
and
occupies
a
resident
with
five
rooms
already,
then
that's
not
a
motel.
now,
may
i
please
the
court.
this
is
--
this
case
has
gotten
in
a
hurry
and
i'm
not
sure
how
much
of
the
briefs,
the
court
has
had
an
opportunity
to
look
at,
and
in
a
short
time
allotted
to
me,
it
will
be
hard
to
cover
and
i
want
to
take
some
amount
of
information
approximately
half
of
my
time
on
direct
and
about
a
half
of
it
on
rebuttal.
there
are
five
theories
of
law
that
we
are
to
allow
in
this
case.
number
one,
that
the
law
of
the
land
and
any
lawyer
of
the
land
that
have
a
--
quite
whole
as
this
case
is,
and
what
the
law
of
the
land
is
and
is
true
is
our
first
one,
that
is
the
decision
of
civil
rights
cases
which
was
upheld
by
this
court
in
1883.
the
second
proposition
--
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
yes.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
white
cases,
one
that
just
fits
your
case
exactly.
you
don't
have
a
red
head
or
back
tail,
it's
all
white
and
fits
a
whole
case
precisely.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
we
know
what
we've
done.
the
second
proposition
is
that
the
fourteenth
amendment,
neither
the
fourteenth
amendment,
in
all
the
constitution,
prohibit
racial
discrimination
by
an
individual.
the
third
proposition,
we
contend
for
civil
rights
act,
is
an
unlawful
extension
of
the
power
of
commerce,
out
of
the
commerce
clause.
number
five,
we
contend
that
the
act,
the
civil
rights
act
violates
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
and
lastly,
it
violates
the
thirteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
and
we
submit
gentlemen,
that
if
we
can
prevail
on
any
theory,
any
one
of
those
five
theories,
then
this
act
has
got
to
pay
you.
while
the
act
was
biased,
what
the
morals
or
the
reasons
of
a
legislative
intents
or
purposes
were
as
a
matter
for
the
people
on
the
other
side
of
the
square
across
first
street
and
congress.
i
will
not
judge
on
those,
maybe
accepting
a
book.
but
we're
in
a
court
of
law,
the
highest
court
in
this
country.
and
i
submit
that
the
only
thing
really
that's
be
decided
here
is
whether
the
people
in
congress
had
the
right
under
the
law
to
pass
this
act.
the
fundamental
question
besides
illegal
question
of
a
constitutionality
there,
the
fundamental
question
i
submit
is
whether
or
not
congress
has
the
power
to
take
away
the
live
of
an
individual
to
run
his
business
as
he
sees
fit
in
the
selection
and
choice
of
his
customs.
this
is
the
real
and
part
of
the
issue.
and
the
fact
of
alleged
civil
rights
of
the
negroes
involved
is
purely
incidental,
because
if
congress
can
exercise
these
consultative
of
the
right
of
individuals,
it
is
possible
that
there's
no
limits
to
congress'
power
to
appropriate
private
property
and
living.
theory
number
one,
the
congress
passed
an
act
in
1875,
which
is
almost
identical
in
public
accomodation
section
of
this
act,
and
in
1883,
congress
--
this
supreme
court,
held
that
that
act
was
unconstitutional.
upon
the
lengthy
decision
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
did
not
prohibit
racial
discrimination
by
an
individual
where
there
was
no
state
action
involved
and
then
they
hastily
say
that
there's
no
state
action
in
any
way
involved
in
this
case.
this
case
was
brought
two
hours
at
the
present,
signed
the
bill.
the
state
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
they
did
not
fight
even
a
print
of
the
court
brief
as
did
five
other
states.
and
i
didn't
asked
him
that.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
they
have
one
just
like
they
had
in
the
maryland
case
cited
in
june.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
an
individual
under
the
state
--
under
that
state
statute
can
seek
a
remedy
out
of
a
statute.
it
has
not
been
applied
as
being
made
a
public
notice
that
the
state
and
the
city
of
atlanta
will
not
apply
themselves.
it's
been
publicly
informed.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
actually,
the
state
doesn't
apply
it
except
in
the
form
that
we
file
--
an
individual
has
to
swear
a
warrant
for
someone
abiding
the
statute
and
then
they'd
be
tried
in
state
courts.
similar,
almost
exactly
the
maryland
statute
considered
into
bell
versus
maryland
case.
in
1883
decision,
which
under
the
american
jurisprudence
is
the
law
of
the
land
until
this
court
overturns
it,
they
held
that
the
similar
act
was
unconstitutional.
that
is
true,
in
1913,
the
butz
case
came
along
and
said,
“well,
they
didn't
talk
about
commerce
clause
at
that
time.
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
get
around
the
language,
the
court
in
that
case,
when
it
said
that,
“of
course,
on
one
will
contain
that
the
power
to
pass
this
act,
that
civil
rights
act,
was
contained
in
the
constitution
before
the
adoption
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.”
they
start
off
the
opinion
that
way,
so
they
was
no
one
doubt
about
it
as
far
until
we
got
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
you
couldn't
pass
such
an
act,
to
restrain
an
individual
or
prohibit
him
from
exercising
racial
discrimination,
as
long
as
the
state
won't
involve.
it
is
my
contention
that
any
supreme
court,
when
a
case
goes
before,
it,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
the
people
thought
that
enacted
the
law
or
what
was
that
theory
that
people
who
argued
the
case
before
the
court,
the
court
has
to
look
at
the
constitution
that
just
stands
any
amendments
to
it
in
regardless
of
whether
we
have
anything
to
say
about
them,
as
counsel,
to
consider
the
pros
and
cons
of
a
case
and
apply
the
law
as
it
is,
not
how
it
is,
all
i
can
do
--
how
the
people
in
congress
thought
it
should
be.
i've
been
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
many
times
and
when
they
decided
the
case
--
neither
of
us,
neither
the
counsel,
they
never
mentioned
that
there
--
and
so
in
the
civil
rights
cases,
it
is
my
contention
that
the
court
at
that
time
knew
that
the
commerce
clause
was
sitting
there
in
the
constitution.
it
had
been
there
almost
a
hundred
years
and
when
they
decided
the
case
and
simply
after
saying
of
course,
nobody
thought
it
was
constitution
for
--
passed
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
they
said
the
fourteenth
amendment
did
not
help
it
out
and
in
fact,
was
still
unconstitutional.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
in
that
case?
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
oh
your
honor,
i
think
all
they
said
was
that
this
was
not
raised
in
that
case
as
to
whether
it
was
applied
to
put
aside
as
to
one
of
the
premise,
i
don't
know.
but
i'd
like
to
read
two
portion,
i
know
the
court
doesn't
like
to
hear
reading
much
but
this
opinion
because
it
is,
i
think
is
fundamental
opinion
that
the
court
has
got
to
consider.
and
this
is
a
quote,
“if
these
legislations
appropriate
for
enforcing
the
prohibitions
of
the
amendment,
the
fourteenth,
it
is
difficult
to
see
where
it
is
to
start.”
why
may
not
congress
with
equal
show
of
authority
enact
the
code
of
laws
for
the
enforcement
and
vindication
of
all
rights
of
life
living
in
property?
civil
rights
such
as
again,
deemed
by
the
constitution
against
state
aggression
cannot
be
impaired
by
the
wrongful
act
of
individuals
unsupported
by
state
authority
in
the
shape
of
law's
customs
or
judicial
or
executive
proceedings.
but
the
wrongful
act
of
an
individual
unsupported
by
as
such
authorities
is
simply
(inaudible)
wrong.”
to
pass
on
to
my
next
theory
--
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
that's
true
your
honor.
they
did
in
the
lower
court
but
they
–
it
is
interesting
that
they
changed
their
approach
to
the
case
in
this
court.
as
a
matter
fact,
it
was
stated
mr.
marshall
in
the
lower
court
that
they
did
rely
on
fourteenth
amendment
in
open
court.
but
in
the
briefs
in
this
court
has
not
relied.
and
they
also
backed
off
from
two
other
theories
which
i
will
mention
in
a
minute
in
which
they
did
not.
they
have
relied
strictly
on
the
commerce
clause
in
this
case
it
seems
to
me
in
that
brief.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
in
the
open
argument
in
the
lower
court
they
relied
on
it.
in
their
brief,
they
said
they
rely
on
a
single
question,
that
is
whether
or
not,
it's
a
commerce
clause
is
sufficient
to
give
the
congress
power
to
pass
that
--
that's
true
in
that
brief.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
i'm
sure
it
does
your
honor,
verbal
argument
but
he
--
i
think
--
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
mr.
justice
goldberg
referring
to
my
brief
officially.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
yes,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
no
sir,
because
they
have
made
the
statement
in
the
brief
as
in
this
case
right
here,
in
this
hearing,
and
they
state
their
claim
and
that's
the
words
they
use
on
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
i
don't
think
anyone
can
limit
this
court
to
what
issues
the
court
will
consider,
just
because
this
is
a
–-
if
they
claim
and
stand
up
all
on
one
theory,
that's
their
privilege.
we've
got
five,
we
think
we
can
stand
it
all.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
sir,
we
have
taken
that.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
i
think
this
court
has
the
leeway
to
consider
any
portion
of
the
constitution
at
anytime,
any
argument.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
yes.
i
don't
think
congress
can
limit
the
court
as
to
what
they
try
to
base
the
act.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
black
but
--
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
but
of
course,
the
constitution
is
a
document
of
delegated
powers
originally,
and
then
by
amendments
they
have
added
things
that
were
prohibited
both
either
to
the
states
or
to
the
congress,
or
to
the
national
government,
and
if
any
one
of
those
delegated
powers
would
make
the
unconstitutional
and
it
would
be,
unless
it
was
prohibited
by
one
of
the
prohibitions
in
some
of
the
amendments.
i
think
most
of
the
prohibitions
of
powers
are
contained
in
the
amendments.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
yes
sir,
because
we
are
not
bound
by
what
congress
thinks
is
a
way
to
pass
that
act.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
your
honor,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
suppose
they
said
that
this
act
is
based
on
x.y.z.
to
get
the
commerce
clause.
and
this
act
puts
a
man
in
jail
without
any
trial,
without
a
trial
by
jury
or
he
made
a
trial,
and
we
say
that
this
act
is
based
on
x.y.z.
in
the
constitution.
can
congress
violate
a
man's
constitutional
right
by
saying,
we
will
base
it
on
something
in
the
constitution
that
we
alone
will
take
out
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
be
over
terms?
i
believe,
i
say
no
(voice
overlap).
sir?
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
maybe
not,
but
i
hope
to
make
it
that.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
looking
at
the
record,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
attorney
general
at
that
time
in
‘63,
before
the
hearings
in
‘64,
urged
the
congress
to
limit
this
act
to
those
deals
when
we'd
say
was
an
established
jurisdiction
or
established
power
of
congress
under
the
commerce
clause,
but
in
the
hearings
in
64,
there
was
very
little
of
that
and
most
of
the
things
cited
in
the
brief
pertained
to
the
hearings
in
‘63.
now
the
reason
i
mentioned
that
is
because
it
is
our
contention,
and
i
hope
to
get
to
that
there
are
no
legislative
findings
of
fact
in
this
case
and
there
are
no
standards
setup
by
which
to
determine
in
the
motel
instance
where
a
motel
is
subject
to
this
act.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
well,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
don't
want
to
try
to
limit
the
–
the
solicitor
general,
he
said
in
his
brief,
but
that
is
all
he
has
said
in
his
brief.
and
i
don't
think
he
can.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
i
can't
find
from
the
statue
itself,
unless
we're
just
talking
about
strictly
public
accommodation
statute
that
anything
contrary
to
that
because
they
say
that
a
motel
has
got
that
commerce
and
so
and
so,
an
arrest
in
which
there
is
interstate
commerce.
and
therefore,
you
obviously
hit
that
in
a
state
commerce.
and
i
think
that's
what
they
did
because
surely
they
would
advise
and
i
know
they
were
in
the
hearings,
the
existence
of
this
1883
holding
and
i'm
sure
they
shied
away
from
the
fourteenth
amendment
at
that
time.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
oh
i'm
sure
they
attempted
to.
i'm
not
sure
that
they
said
they
limit
themselves
at
that
time.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
there's
a
fourteenth
–-
a
substantive
reference
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
yes
sir.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
i
think
so.
i
think
the
court
can
consider
any
part
of
the
constitution
and
amendment
said,
do
and
decide
anything
that
comes
before
this
court.
and
neither
congress
nor
counsel
of
either
side
can
limit
this
court
in
this
consideration.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
i
just
attempt
an
answer
to
the
court's
question
your
honor.
that's
right,
i
agree
with
you.
i
think
we
have
--
i
think
there
are
other
issues
that
the
court
will
have
to
consider
besides
the
contentions
to
the
solicitor
general,
the
five
different
theories
that
we
are
proposing.
and
one
--
very
simple
one,
if
it's
the
law
of
the
land
is
still
the
law
of
the
land,
until
this
court
changed
it.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
they
had
to
because
the
commerce
clause
is
in
the
constitution.
they
had
to
consider
the
whole
constitution
when
they
say
--
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
that
is
my
position
mr.
judge
goldberg.
in
the
case
they
were
deciding
this
court
on,
it
was
handed
down
on
june
22
of
this
year,
in
bell
versus
maryland,
there
was
a
maryland
trespass
law,
anti-trespass
law,
involved
and
of
course,
the
court
really
just
sent
the
case
back
to
maryland
for
further
decision.
but
the
opinions
in
and
the
court
written
by
three
judges
on
each
side,
would
it
–
has
to
read
a
point
up
on
a
lot
of
our
argument
in
this
case
because,
in
mr.
justice
black's
decision,
that
was
joined
in
by
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
harlan,
“you
three
justices
have
said
in
substance
that
the
constitution
including
the
fourteenth
amendment
did
not
prohibit
an
individual
from
practicing
racial
discrimination
unsupported
by
interstate
action
of
itself.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
howitzer.
and
that
is
this
case
exactly,
a
private
individual
be
elected
to
refuse
to
serve
and
refuse
to
participate
or
maybe
civil
rights
act
in
order
to
bring
the
declaratory
judgment
--
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
well
i've
realized
that
your
honor.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
i'll
try
to
make
--
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
if
i
may
please
the
court,
i'm
going
--
i'm
really
at
planning
the
last
tape
i
was
listening,
talking
about
commerce
because
i
want
to
try
to
cover
these
other
theories
which
i
say
i
contend
that
any
one
of
them
is
good,
the
act
will
play
along
those
as
well
as
the
commerce
clause.
of
course,
if
the
constitution
does
not
prohibit
racial
discrimination
by
an
individual,
unsupported
by
any
of
the
act,
and
i
grant
the
court
that
this
civil
rights
act
was
passed
after
this
decision
in
june
6
of
1964.
but
if
the
constitution
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
don't
prohibit,
and
congress
gets
all
of
its
power
to
enact
any
legislation
from
the
constitution,
how
then
can
congress
pass
an
act
which
will
prohibit
racial
discrimination
by
an
individual?
article
vi
of
the
constitution
says,
“supreme
law
of
this
land
is
the
constitution,
law
is
passed
pursuant
to
it
in
treaties.”
now
congress
can't
pass
any
law
that's
not
pursuant
to
some
delegation
of
power
under
the
constitution,
one
of
them
could
be
the
commerce
clause.
all
that
came
to
anything
that
is
prohibited
by
the
constitution
and
the
opinion
of
it
--
that
i've
just
referred
to
which
is
a
dissenting
opinion
said
that
the
constitution
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
itself
precisely
did
not
without
state
action
prohibit
racial
discrimination
by
an
individual.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
you
made
it
very
clear
in
the
footnotes
and
that's
exactly
what
you
think
--
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'll
be
glad
to
exceed
to
the
wishes
of
the
court,
if
i
may
comment
on
the
thirteenth
amendment
briefly
--
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
--
our
court,
i
will
cover
in
brief
therein
my
theory
of
the
commerce
clause
and
comeback
for
the
final
rebuttal.
the
thirteenth
amendment
simply
says
that
neither
slavery
nor
involuntary
servitude
shall
exist
within
the
united
states.
now
50
years
ago,
this
court
in
the
case
of
hughes
versus
united
states,
held
that
involuntary
servitude
was
denounced
by
the
thirteenth
amendment
as
of
means
of
condition
or
compulsory
service
of
one
to
another,
and
while
that
cause
means
the
thirteenth
amendment.
inside
of
that
amendment
was
the
emancipation
of
the
colored
races,
it
reaches
every
race
and
every
individual.
and
there
had
been
other
cases
which
have
held
that
if
a
person
is
forced
to
serve
another
in
business
ways
that
if
that
involves
involuntary
servitude
prohibited
by
the
thirteenth
amendment,
i've
cited
cases
in
the
brief.
now
i
won't
read
it
of
course.
but
all
of
these
cases
go
to
service
contracts
of
one
person,
performance
services
in
business
for
another.
in
our
fifth
circuit
court
in
1944
held
that
even
if
that
person
was
compensated
for
it,
unless
the
compensation
itself
constituted
a
waiver
of
their
objections.
that
compensation
itself
involuntary
servitude
still
violated
the
thirteenth
amendment.
of
course
there
are
exceptions
to
it
--
it
has
been
held
in
this
court
that
involuntary
servitude
does
not
mean
service
in
the
armed
forces
although,
(inaudible)
disagree
with
that.
and
they
held
that
service
of
a
term
of
--
penalty
for
a
crime
of
course
is
not
voluntary
servitude.
but
there
are
eight
cases
cited
here
in
the
--
of
the
united
states
supreme
court,
that's
a
fifth
circuit
court
case
and
a
seventh
circuit
court
case
and
a
case
in
one
of
the
state's
supreme
courts
which
have
held
at
service
of
another,
against
his
will
in
a
business
that
constitutes
involuntary
servitude
which
prohibited
on
the
thirteenth
amendment.
now
may
it
please
the
court
as
to
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
justice
goldberg
made
probably
the
--
one
of
the
most
profound
statements
about
the
constitution
that
i've
ever
read
in
which
i'm
not
sure
that
a
whole
lot
of
lawyers
in
this
country
would
agree
with
me
or
even
with
the
justices
at
this
time
but
i
think
it's
still
true.
in
the
maryland
case,
to
quote
mr.
justice
goldberg,
“our
sworn
duty
could
do
construe
the
constitution
requires
however
that
we
read
it
to
effectuate
the
intent
and
purpose
of
the
framers.”
not
the
framers,
as
if
they
were
sitting
in
this
room
that
they
passed
any
judgment
on
what
the
constitution
is
supposed
to
be,
but
what
the
framers
intended
the
constitution
to
be
at
that
time
it
happened
in
1787.
if
that
theory
is
not
so,
then
the
constitution
is
just
like
any
another
law,
it
could
be
changed
from
day-to-day
by
the
congress
and
by
the
courts.
the
difference
between
our
government
and
any
other
government
in
this
world
is
that
we
have
a
constitution
that
stays
at
a
constitution
in
the
words
at
its
there,
unless
it
is
amended
--
in
a
way
the
constitution
provides.
our
constitution
is
still
the
same
constitution
it
was
in
1787,
except
the
amendments
of
the
people.
the
people
have
decided
should
be
added
to
it.
when
this
constitution
was
adopted,
the
united
states
was
broke.
we
were
in
the
middle
of
a
depression
as
we
know
it.
a
financial
chaos,
the
securities
of
this
country
were
practically
--
they
were
selling
for
15
as
a
matter
of
fact.
new
york
state
and
new
jersey
state
were
fighting
the
trade
war
between
each
other.
the
potomac
river
out
of
here
was
the
subject
of
dispute
between
virginia
and
pennsylvania
and
maryland
because
of
tax
and
restrictions
placed
on
trade.
and
the
reasons
of
the
virginia
assembly,
called
the
--
the
convention
call
it
--
on
at
an
utmost
convention,
was
to
talk
about
trade.
they
went
for
five
states
there
so
as
they
said,
“let's
go
back
and
get
everybody
here
and
call
the
next
one,”
and
said
between
1787
which
was
the
constitutional
convention.
and
the
subject
of
that
convention
was
some
way
to
prop
up
the
united
states
financially
because
trade
between
the
states
was
not
going
well
and
that
was
the
real
chaos
that
we
were
having.
and
there
is
the
basis
of
that
little
old
innocuous
clause
in
the
constitution
which
says
that
the
congress
shall
have
power
to
regulate
trade
among
the
states.
the
best
analysis
--
not
in
my
opinion
but
of
historian,
the
best
analysis
of
the
constitution
and
there
are
reasons
puts
adoption
and
the
--
and
why
it
was
adopted,
it's
found
in
the
federalist
papers.
and
in
number
11,
alexander
hamilton
defied
commerce
as
the
free
circulation
of
commodities.
and
in
number
42,
james
madison,
the
other
(inaudible)
stated
a
very
material
object
of
this
file
of
commerce
clause,
was
the
relief
of
states
which
import
and
export
throughout
the
states,
from
their
proper
contributions
levied
on
them
by
the
latter.
where
these
are
limited
to
regulate
the
trade
between
state
and
state,
it
must
be
foreseen
their
way,
would
be
bound
to
load
the
articles
of
import
and
export
during
the
passage
through
their
jurisdiction,
with
duties
which
would
fall
on
the
makers
of
the
latter
and
consumers
of
the
fall.
so
what
does
that
mean
in
our
case?
we
say
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
intended
to
cover
commerce
as
commerce
is
known
in
business
fields.
and
that
it
was
intended
to
cover
the
transportation
and
movement
and
production
of
articles
--
from
agriculture,
products
of
industry,
methods
of
transportation,
tariffs
between
states
which
we
don't
have
now,
thank
goodness.
and
anything
else
that
had
to
deal
with
commerce.
but
as
the
birmingham
justice
in
this
case
recently
said,
tennyson
brook
--
unlike
tennyson
brook,
commerce
has
got
to
come
to
an
end
somewhere.
and
it
end
sooner
or
later
interstate.
it
can't
go
on
forever.
and
commerce
means
as
the
framer
of
the
constitution
intended
to
mean,
all
of
the
thing
they
thought
about
at
that
time
was
actual
goods
in
commerce
and
the
transportation
of
their
own.
that
is
true,
that
congress
and
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
have
enlarged
the
commerce
power
beyond
which
--
i
submit
the
framer
never
intended,
they
never
thought
it
would
be.
and
in
this
case,
it
is
significant
that
the
commerce
power
in
the
three
big
fields,
the
way
they
usually
referred
to,
an
antitrust
and
wage
and
hour
label.
in
all
three
of
those
fields,
congress
setup
some
standard.
in
any
trust
field,
you've
even
got
to
be
on
in
interstate
commerce
or
material
effective,
but
at
least
to
the
courts
with
determination
or
whether
a
particular
business
is
in
this
interstate
commerce.
they
don't
say
congress
as
a
matter
of
fact
can
say
if
it's
on
a
court
that
every
business
is
subject
to
anti-trust
laws.
in
the
wage
and
hour
field,
no
business
is
subject
to
interstate
commerce
generally
speak
and
unless
it
has
a
certain
volume
of
business
and
they
even
have
two
or
three
different
standards
of
that.
but
not
every
business
is
subject
to
wage
and
hour
laws.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
motel
and
hotel
industry
specifically
excluded
from
it
at
this
time.
and
in
the
labor
field,
not
until
just
very
recently,
in
the
--
in
hotel
employees
case,
when
the
supreme
court
said
to
the
national
labor
relations
board,
you
cannot
exclude
as
a
class,
all
hotels
and
motels
from
your
jurisdiction.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
that
does
have
a
reference
your
honor.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
no
sir.
because
i
don't
think
this
is
applicable
but
even
though
they
use
the
mann
act,
the
interstate
commerce
actually,
that
--
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
there's
a
holding
of
united
states
supreme
court
that
says
people
are
not
commerce.
people
engaged
in
commerce,
people
take
part
in
commerce
but
people
themselves
are
not
part
of
the
--
are
not
commerce.
and
is
so
--
so
been
hereby
this
court,
and
never
been
overruled.
and
for
as
that,
isn't
not
a
good
case
to
rely.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
it's
the
mayor
etcetera
of
the
city
of
new
york
versus
m-i-l-n,
miln?
decided
in
this
court
and
it's
in
my
brief.
but
they
--
they
--
the
supreme
court
in
that
case,
people
were
not
part
of
commerce
--
they
engage
in
it,
but
they
are
not
part
of
it.
certainly
the
framers
in
putting
that
one
clause
in
the
constitution
didn't
include
or
intend
to
include
people
at
that
time.
but
we
now
made
the
analogy
with
the
labor
cases
is
that,
not
every
motel,
not
every
hotel
is
subject
to
the
rulings
of
the
jurisdiction
on
the
national
labor
relations
board.
all
the
court
has
held
is
that
the
board
cannot
exclude
them
as
a
class.
they
look
at
each
case
to
decide
if
that
particular
operation
organization
is
interstate
commerce,
all
material
effects
interstate
commerce
just
as
in
the
other
cases
of
wage
and
hour
in
anti-trust.
so
we
say
that
in
this
case,
the
means
adopted
--
the
commerce
clause
if
you
have
it,
to
the
end
–
in
the
end
decide
have
no
race
or
relation.
there's
no
connection
between
the
two.
they
have
simply
--
after
being
involved
in
the
civil
rights
cases,
in
1883,
it
seems
like
they
have
said,
“while
we
came
filing
this
in
the
constitution,
put
this
on
list,
do
put
them
on
the
commerce
clause.
we've
been
able
to
get
away
with
so
much
else
for
the
commerce
clause
already.”
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
the
triple
a
case
your
honor?
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
may
it
please
the
court.
and
i
say
this
--
this
is
my
reason
of
thought.
of
course
in
that
case
they
said,
just
go
to
the
man
raise
in
the
field.
he's
just
one
man.
he
doesn't
affect
commerce
by
himself
but
if
you
take
all
the
rest
of
the
farmers,
they
will
materially
affect
commerce.
now,
they
have
got
some
substance
--
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
well,
the
reliance
--
few
of
all
cases,
is
even
more
recent
case
which
says
if
a
dealer
does
--
if
all
of
the
rest
of
the
dealers
does
the
same
in
this
deal
therefore,
we've
all
in
interstate
commerce.
if
you
apply
that
theory,
may
it
please
the
court,
let
me
show
you
how
ridiculous,
i
think
that
gets
to
be.
suppose
the
airport
barbershop
at
dallas
international
says,
“we
won't
cut
the
hair
of
any
man
who
is
blonde.”
and
a
man
goes
up
there
to
get
a
haircut
and
he's
blonde
headed,
and
he
is
(inaudible)
and
they
won't
cut
it.
now
is
that
barbershop
putting
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
because
they
won't
cut
that
man's
hair?
no.
but
in
every
barbershop,
in
every
airline
terminal,
airplane
terminal
in
this
country
said,
they
wouldn't.
and
you've
got
to
presume
that
they
would
do
just
that.
then,
all
of
them
place
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
and
therefore,
if
you
character
the
extreme,
then
congress
can't
cover
every
activity,
every
facet
of
life
because
if
you
take
any
particular
facet
of
life,
even
the
manufacturer
of
pencil
that
a
lawyer
has
to
use
and
say
that
because
every
lawyer
has
got
to
use
a
pencil
if
you're
done
and
do
so,
and
so
he's
subject
to
that
act
of
--
to
the
power
of
congress
on
the
commerce
clause.
it
gets
to
a
ridiculous
situation
where
a
congress
then
can
do
anything.
and
that
gets
me
to
another
point
that
i
want
to
make
before
i
stop
for
rebuttal.
this
constitution
setup
powers
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government
and
enumerate
--
and
in
the
tenth
amendment,
it
reserved
to
the
states
all
the
powers
not
set
forth
therein,
to
the
states
or
the
people.
and
all
the
reason
for
the
existence
of
this
supreme
court,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
to
maintain
the
balance
of
powers
between
those
different
governments.
and
if
this
court
will
let
congress
do
anything
it
wants
to
on
the
commerce
clause,
and
that's
what
that
argument
means.
if
this
court
will
let
them
do
anything,
then
this
court
has
advocated
and
there's
no
reason
for
the
existence
of
the
supreme
court
to
adjust
and
maintain
the
balance
of
powers
between
the
various
governments
in
this
country.
that
is
the
function
of
the
supreme
court.
that
is
the
very
reason
for
its
setup
in
the
constitution,
to
balance
all
powers
between
the
two
by
declaring
the
act
of
a
state
un-constitutional
or
declaring
the
act
of
commerce
unconstitutional.
and
if
you
have
the
key
from
that
power,
there
will
be
no
reason
for
the
supreme
court
because
congress
then
can
do
anything
it
wants
in
any
facet
of
our
life.
i
oppose
the
question
which
i've
tried
to
answer
in
rebuttal.
the
real
question
in
this
case,
how
far
can
congress
go?
what
limit
is
it
beyond
which
congress
cannot
go?
is
there
any
limit?
does
tennyson
brook
run
on
forever
too?
what
limit
is
it
that
congress
cannot
overstep
in
face?
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
and
mr.
justice
black,
if
you
understand
that
let
me
say
something
about
it
right
now.
we've
cited
three
cases
in
this
brief.
one
about
the
yellow
cab
company
in
chicago,
one
about
howard
johnson
restaurant
on
interstate
highway,
and
about
(inaudible)
in
new
york
state?
and
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
a
man
who
went
to
chicago
to
the
railroad
terminal
and
got
off
the
train
and
got
in
a
taxi
cab,
that
that
taxi
cab
was
not
involved
interstate
commerce
because
commerce
that
the
man
was
in
ceased
to
stop
at
the
terminal.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
they
have
said
they
can
come
in
--
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
i
recognized
your
honor
that
--
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
i
recognize
your
honor
that
there
are
a
lot
of
minor
cases
that
you
don't
--
congress
can't
regulate,
i
think
congress
spelled,
intrastate
activity
–
duty
local
activities
if
congress
thinks
that
they
place
that
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
i
will
try
to
hit
that
in
the
rebuttal.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
i
see
no
reason,
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question
to
suppose
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
section
5
thereof,
were
intended
to
curtail
the
power
that
congress
would
have
under
section
3,
the
appropriate
clauses,
to
deal
with
things
that
were
obstructions
to
interstate
commerce.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
–
may
it
place
the
court.
the
argument
counsel
today
is
quite
different
from
the
argument
solicitor
general
made
in
case
of
bell
versus
howell.
i'd
like
to
read
one
statement
that's
reported
in
your
opinion,
that
the
solicitor
general
made.
the
preservation
of
a
free
and
pluralistic
society
which
seemed
to
require
substantial
freedom
for
private
chores
in
social
business
and
professional
associations,
freedom
of
choice
means
an
ability
to
be
wrong
as
well
as
right,
to
be
mean
as
well
as
noble,
to
be
vicious
as
well
as
kind.
and
even
if
that
deal
were
questioned,
the
philosophy
of
federalism
leads
an
area
for
the
choice
to
the
states
and
their
people.
when
the
state
is
not
otherwise
involved,
instead
of
vesting
the
only
power
of
executive
decision
in
the
federal
courts
--
how
did
you
square
that
with
the
argument
today
--
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
but
his
argument
today,
may
it
place
the
court,
is
that
the
congress
had
the
right
to
pass
this
act
about
all
motels
because
motels
deal
in
people,
and
people
get
to
the
motels
by
interstate
commerce.
and
that
for
all
people,
that
come
into
that
motel
or
in
interstate
commerce
and
be
covered.
he
further
says
that
the
real
reason
that
congress
has
a
right
to
therefore
pass
legislation
affects
all
motels
and
all
people
is
because
of
the
conditions
that
are
arisen
in
this
country
that
places
burdens
on
interstate
commerce.
now,
i
remember
the
brief
filed
in
this
case
by
the
government
talks
about
the
burdens
that
existed
in
1963.
but
his
brief
also
shows
in
atlanta,
georgia
that
there
were
14
major
hotels
that
had
already
desegregated.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
shows
how
much
business
he
says
we've
gotten
in
atlanta
that
goes
ahead
and
the
truth
of
the
matter
is,
the
heart
of
atlanta
motel
is
the
only
place
in
the
atlanta,
georgia
that
hasn't
desegregated
voluntarily.
now
let's
turn
the
court
in
the
other
way.
suppose
the
heart
of
atlanta
is
the
only
place
in
atlanta
that
doesn't
desegregate
voluntarily.
does
that
one
motel
affect
commerce
so
badly
and
place
such
a
burden
on
it
that
congress
can
pass
a
law?
if
i
had
one
motel
out
of
60,000
in
the
united
states
as
the
only
one
that
doesn't
desegregate,
does
that
place
a
burden
on
congress
--
on
interstate
commerce?
and
if
the
purpose
of
the
passing
of
the
civil
rights
act
was
to
relieve
the
burden
on
interstate
commerce
--
by
virtue
of
reference
to
the
things
that
happened
in
birmingham
and
little
rock
and
so
forth,
all
of
which
happened
some
time
ago
now
thank
goodness.
if
it
was
to
relieve
the
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
has
it
done
so?
all
the
desegregation
mostly
and
the
most
citizen
in
the
south
as
occurred
before
the
passage
of
the
civil
rights
act,
there
is
no
mentioned
in
the
brief
for
an
argument
of
the
things
that
have
happened
since
the
passage
of
the
civil
rights
act.
there
is
no
mention
of
riots
in
the
streets
in
new
york
or
rochester
or
philadelphia,
has
the
act
accomplished
anything?
this
court
is
not
here
to
determine
whether
congress
acting
wisely
or
not.
it
is
only
here
to
determine
where
it
acted
legally
within
the
constitution.
now
so
to
said
that
there's
only
--
there's
only
question,
was
there
a
rational
basis
for
the
legislative
determination
based
on
the
burden
placed
on
interstate
commerce.
we
get
to
the
question
to
mr.
justice
black
posed
in
the
morning,
and
mr.
justice
goldberg
posed.
and
i
have
to
come
to
grips
with
it
to
answer.
and
the
question
is,
can
congress
control
racial
discrimination
by
an
individual
where
there
is
no
state
connection
at
all
and
it
is
none
in
this
case?
then,
all
laws
in
the
--
on
the
books
of
the
state
of
georgia
or
in
the
city
of
atlanta,
with
two
exceptions,
one
of
them
is
anti-trespass
law
which
does
not
mention
race
as
a
ground.
it
can
be
used
to
keep
anybody
in
this
courtroom
out
of
a
man's
place,
if
he
wants
to.
and
the
other
one
is
as
far
as
i
know
they're
all
about
the
marriage
of
races.
but
if
the
congress
can
pass
the
law
to
call
all
commerce
and
include
all
motels,
we
have
to
face
the
issue
whether
or
not
one
individual
is
the
gauge
or
whether
one
individual
--
one
individual
be
--
with
all
other
business
in
that
filed
such
as
reliance
fuel
oil
cases,
will
affect
all
commerce.
and
whether
or
not
--
the
phrase
used
by
the
counsel
frequently
in
his
argument
about
commercial
activities
is
sufficient
to
give
congress
the
power
to
pass
regulations
on
a
code
of
law
that
effect
personal
conduct
of
individuals.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
your
honor,
i
am
absolutely
truthful
as
i
should.
in
my
opinion,
the
argument
of
counsel
and
of
the
government
that
this
is
done
to
relieve
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
is
so
much
hogwash,
that
the
purpose
of
congress
was
to
pass
a
law
which
some
way
or
other,
they
could
control
discrimination
by
individuals
in
the
whole
united
states.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
i
agree.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
i
agree,
that
is
the
reason
they
passed
the
act.
but
the
--
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
and
i
started
all
my
argument
--
yes
your
honor.
that
i
did
not
want
to
go
into
the
reason
why
congress
passed
act
or
whether
they're
right
or
wrong,
well
this
is
the
court
of
law.
we
are
not
arguing
a
case
for
general
facts
as
the
last
half
of
the
argument
the
government
has
been,
as
to
whether
the
facts
justify
the
means
adopted
by
congress.
this
is
a
court
of
law
to
decide
whether
congress
had
the
right
on
the
constitution,
the
legal
right,
not
whether
it
was
a
good
thing
to
do,
whether
it's
a
human
thing
to
do
or
the
kind
thing
or
the
moral
thing.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
well
that's
where
i
was
tying
to
come
to
grips
with
your
question
and
justice
black's
question,
because
i
think
this
is
answer,
and
i
will
now
propose
it.
the
government
just
quoted
to
school
boy
--
familiar
quote
that
all
of
us
know
but
none
of
us
much
understand
i
think,
that
all
men
are
created
equal.
it's
in
that
declaration
of
independence,
i
don't
believe
it's
in
the
--
but
chief
justice
duckworth
of
our
georgia
supreme
court
has
said,
in
one
sentence,
something
is
clear
to
me
that
anything
i've
ever
heard
on
the
subject
of
all
men
being
created
equal.
liberty
stops
where
to
extend
it,
invades
a
liberty
of
another.
i
didn't
come
here
to
talk
about
commerce,
i
didn't
come
here
to
argue
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
motel
has
an
effect
on
commerce
certainly
everything
that
happens
in
this
country
has
an
effect
on
commerce.
but
i
did
perceive,
i
hope
that
in
the
writings
of
memos
of
this
court
there
is
still
the
great
facet
of
personal
liberty
that
this
court
stands
for.
this
court
under
the
constitution
is
the
last
(inaudible)
of
personal
liberty,
where
else
can
a
man
go
to
depend
personally.
so
if
you
get
the
old
question
that
you
ask,
the
answer
is
that
commerce
has
got
to
stop
somewhere
with
commerce
in
the
sense
that
a
business
function
is
commerce.
and
that
there
is
power
of
a
commerce
clause
on
the
constitution
does
not
go
to
people.
if
you
don't
accept
that
fundamental,
i'm
lost.
but
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
an
opinion
just
recently
in
a
case
argued
from
atlanta
by
a
friend
of
mine,
in
which
mr.
justice
douglas
eloquently
spoke
with
the
freedom
of
association
in
the
union
job
case.
since
neither
congress
nor
the
state
legislature
are
going
to
bridge
these
rights,
they
cannot
grant
the
power
to
private
group
to
bridge
in.
as
i
read
the
first
amendment,
it
forbids
any
abridgment
by
the
government
whether
directly
or
indirectly.
there
is
--
the
opinion
to
this
court
to
talk
about
the
freedom
of
the
individual
in
the
bell
case
--
to
discriminate
if
he
says
that's
what
he
wants
to
do
regardless
of
what
congress
says,
in
the
bell
case,
provided
there
is
no
state
action.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
no,
regard
--
whether
or
not
there's
a
state
statute
in
that
or
a
state
action,
not
government.
in
the
union
job
case,
to
spoke
of
the
freedom
of
association
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment.
the
sixth
amendment
says
--
the
sixth
article
of
the
constitution
says
that
only
laws
passed
pursuant
to
the
constitution
are
valid.
and
that
this
court
should
--
in
an
interpretations
determine
where
they
are.
so
unless
this
court
says
that
commerce
stops
with
personal
living,
then
there
is
no
end
to
it.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
we
all
have
to
go
aside
the
record
to
answer
that
i
think.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
yes.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
i
wish
i
had
end
up
to
the
people
to
--
committee
that
took
the
testimony
on
whether
that's
a
factual
situation
--
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
i
probably--
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
mr.
black
--
justice
black,
let
me
say
why
i
said
i'd
like
to
testify.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
because
i
probably
know
more
about
personally,
the
travel
of
the
negro
race
than
any
white
man
in
this
room,
for
the
separating
for
ten
years,
i've
been
president
of
a
corporation
that
owns
and
operates
a
negro
motel
in
atlanta.
and
i
know
for
a
fact
from
operating
this
motel
which
is
widely
known,
been
in
every
national
magazine
and
publication,
a
wide
distribution
in
the
negro
press.
a
widely
known
small
motel,
very
nicely
appointed
and
very
adequately
run,
and
i'll
tell
you
that
there
are
not
enough
customers
to
fill
that
motel
up
every
day
of
the
week
in
an
up
for
20
rooms
in
it.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
that's
in
atlanta.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
no
i
haven't,
but
my
manager
of
the
motel
who
runs
it
is
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
the
national
--
nationwide
hotel
association
and
he
knows
almost
firsthand
the
owners
and
operators
of
some
60
negro
motels
up
and
down
the
east
coast
of
this
country.
but
in
addition
to
that,
most
chains
--
holiday
inn
has
500
units.
they
have
already
segregated
before
they
act.
howard
johnson
has
about
400
and
they
have
already
segregated
before
the
act.
quality
court
has
600,
and
in
most
in
half
of
the
states
they
operate
under
state
law
which
requires
them
to
desegregate
and
the
rest
are
male.
you
take
most
to
the
major
change
of
motels
in
the
united
states
and
i
know
for
a
fact
now,
have
already
desegregated
and
whoa,
before
they
passed
the
1964
act.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
in
all
answers
because
i
think
is
a
matter
of
policy
because
of
that
most
of
them
were
national
in
scope.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
i'm
sure
it
did.
thirty
states
of
course
have
laws
that
cover
this
subject
and
they
of
course
had
to
apply
with
those
laws
and
whether
they
had
changed
that
operate
in
states
have
did
not
have
a
public
accommodation
law
or
state
law.
but
as
a
matter
of
public
policy,
it
changed
and
moved
with
the
time
if
you
want
to
go.
so
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
congress
passed
the
act
--
when
congress
passed
the
act,
there
was
not
any
shortage
of
rooms
in
the
united
states
for
colored
people
to
use.
there
may
have
been
in
atlanta,
when
the
heart
of
atlanta
wouldn't,
but
we're
doing
it
on
principle.
we
started
this
case
two
hours
after
the
law
was
passed
on
principle
that
all
wouldn't
think
congress
had
the
right
to
do
what
they
did.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
congress
did
not
have
any
out
of
the
form,
they
would
say
at
that
time
in
1964,
maybe
in
1963
when
all
evidence
used
this
before
the
court,
really
it's
in
the
record.
it
was
given
--
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
that's
true.
in
1963,
the
act
might
have
had
some
basis
for
saying
that
it
was
a
burden
on
the
interstate
commerce.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
but
the
--
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
no.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
i
didn't
finish,
may
it
please
the
court.
but
the
fact
that
they
tried
to
place
people
on
the
commerce
and
call
him
a
subject
of
commerce
applied
in
1963
as
well
as
now,
i'll
just
meet
in
this
argument
on
facts
if
i
could.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we're
talking
about
facts
that
anybody
could
say
it
is
a
fact,
well
it
may
not
have
been
a
fact
that
people
who
testified
for
the
committees,
who
are
they?
one
man
named
roosevelt,
who
gloried
in
the
name
of
great
father
and
hadn't
done
nothing
much
else
especially
in
this
field
and
a
man
named
roy
wilkins
who's
employed
by
an
association
to
have
that
deal,
was
there
any
mention
in
any
of
the
docket
before
this
court
about
the
findings
of
senator
russell
or
what
he
thought
about
it,
he
was
on
the
committee.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
like
all
the
states
would
have
the
right
to
pass
a
public
accommodation
law
except
for
one
thing,
and
that's
said
so
in
the
brief.
i
think
the
inception
--
they
themselves
and
if
--
they
violate
the
thirteenth
amendment
and
except
for
that,
i
think
the
state
had
the
right
to
pass
public
accommodations
law.
because
that
is
the
state
exercising
police
power
in
the
state
which
the
federal
government
on
that
to
exercise.
i
say,
i
like
the
thirteenth
amendment
for
it's
--
all
of
it.
well
that's
just
the
state
that
simplifies
something.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
that's
a
good
question
mr.
justice.
the
injunction
went
in
effect
on
august
11.
just
to
show
you
what
a
great
market,
there
is
negro
guest
traveling
in
the
interstate
commerce.
we've
had
three
requests
in
two
months.
at
one
time,
we
were
full
and
had
no
rooms,
the
other
two
times
we
took,
we've
had
three
request
and
lord
knows
this
case
has
been
in
the
papers
in
every
member
of
the
negro
race
in
the
united
states
knew
that
we
want
an
injunction
to
take.
right
in
the
middle
of
the
summer
in
august
which
is
the
biggest
travel
month,
go
to
american
--
hope
that
american
automobile
association,
we
had
three
gifts.
none
of
those
three
gifts
but
it
refute
to
the
argument
that
there
is
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
because
there's
no
place
for
a
mistake.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
very
simply
your
honor.
we
run
a
--
may
address
but
i
couldn't
go
into
it
otherwise,
i
don't
think.
we
ran
a
survey
with
5000
guests
in
the
motel.
inside
are
5000
drivers,
a
repeat
customer
who
had
been
at
two
times
or
more
and
asked
them
this
question,
“if
a
member
of
the
negro
race
were
using
our
recreation-films
and
facilities
which
consisted
two
pools
on
an
area
of
200
by
a
100
and
other
things
in
that
recreation
area,
would
you
use
the
swimming
pool
and
would
you
use
the
recreation
area?”
and
90%
of
those
people
said
they
would
not.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
it
hasn't
had
any
effect,
really.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
but
the
question
is
whether
or
not
these
people
would
come
late
as
far
as
an
economic
effect.
but
whether
it
affects
us
badly
on
that?
it's
not
the
question.
it's
whether
or
not
the
congress
had
the
right
to
pass
the
act
to
begin
with.
it
did
helped
us.
counsel
seems
to
think
that
the
act
was
passed
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
in
birmingham
and
little
rock
and
other
people
that
did
have
racial
disturbances
in
the
south.
there
are
43
million
white
people
in
the
south,
and
i'll
say
it
for
all
of
them
--
so
loud
that
congress
can
hear,
“please
don't
do
us
any
more
favors
in
this
for
us.”
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
atlanta
said
with
the
enemies
--
with
friends
like
these,
who
needs
enemies?
upon
this
--
it
is
--
it's
whether
or
not
they
have
the
right
to
do
it
not
whether
they
could.
congress
can
do
anything
if
you
--
if
this
court
does
not
stop
them.
but
whether
they
have
the
right
to
do
what
to
do
is
the
question.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
go
quite
that
far.
i
say
that
congress
has
a
right
to
remove
burden
from
interstate
commerce
if
it
pertains
to
commerce
but
i
believe
that
the
rights
of
individuals,
the
rights
of
people,
the
personal
liberty
of
a
person
to
do
what
he
wants
to,
to
run
his
business
is
important
and
more
paramount
in
the
commerce
of
the
united
states.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
yes
sir,
because
--
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
because
there
is
a
paramount
duty
on
congress
to
protect
the
individual
liberty
over
and
above
trade.
and
that
asset
is
the
crux
of
the
case.
this
court
it
seems
to
me
has
got
to
decide
whether
or
not
commerce
includes
individuals.
it's
that
simple?
if
it
does,
then
the
act
is
constitutional.
if
they
don't
have
the
right
to
(inaudible)
and
take
over
man's
liberty
to
run
his
business
then
this
act
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
no,
but
this
is
different.
this
is
different
in
(voice
overlap)
--
this
is
different
and
it
makes
people
do
something.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
but
every
railroad
and
every
public
utility
is
operating
on
a
franchise
because
they
have
a
monopoly,
all
virtual
monotony.
and
they
are
--
the
congress
has
in
title
placed
restrictions
on
them,
that
they
would
not
ordinary
place
on
every
human
being
in
the
united
states.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
well
they
still
put
it
on
the
basis
of
volume.
they
put
it
on
the
sides.
they
don't
say
every
business
in
united
states
is
under
wage
and
hour
law.
you've
got
to
have
a
volume
of
$500,000
or
more
in
business.
mr.
moreton
rollesten,
jr.
this
means
putting
back
in
the
constitution
that
liberty
of
an
individual
is
more
important
to
interstate
of
commerce,
and
that's
what
i
am
asking.
that's
all.
my
light
is
on,
i'd
like
to
say
this
much
more.
the
poet
shakespeare
once
said
and
it's
my
favorite
quotation.
if
there
is
a
tide
in
the
affairs
of
men
which
taken
at
the
flood,
leads
on
to
victim.
i
say
to
you
that
this
is
the
full
flood
type
in
this
country
at
this
time.
from
this
point
on
in
history,
because
of
issue
i'm
racing
about
people.
that
people
of
this
country
will
know
whether
the
government
exist
for
the
purpose
of
the
preservation
of
the
liberty
of
people
or
exists
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
congress
to
concentrate
power
in
congress
and
in
the
national
government,
it's
as
simple
as
that.
under
the
constitution,
the
decision
is
yours.
you're
not
responsible
for
the
consequences
of
the
decision
but
i
submit
you
are
responsible
that
the
decision
be
just.
