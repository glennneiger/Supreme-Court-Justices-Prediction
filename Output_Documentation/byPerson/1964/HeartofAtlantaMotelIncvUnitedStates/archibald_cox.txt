mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
fact
that
the
court
is
sitting
to
here
--
argument
on
the
day
that
usually
bogged
only
an
opening
ceremony
or
occasion,
testifies
more
forcibly
that
any
words
in
mind
can
do,
to
the
importance
of
the
issues
being
presented
today.
civil
rights
act
of
1964
is
surely
the
most
important
legislation
enacted
in
recent
decades.
it's
one
of
the
half-dozen
most
important
clauses,
i
think.
an
act
didn't
last
century.
no
legislation
within
my
memory
has
been
debated
as
widely
as
long
or
as
thorough.
certainly
none
has
been
considered
more
conscientious.
mr.
archibald
cox
perhaps
the
words
--
differences
of
opinion
that
led
to
some
confusion.
title
ii
as
i
shall
show
is
addressed
to
a
commercial
problem
of
grave
national
significance
--
mr.
archibald
cox
by
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
wish
to
emphasize
and
we'll
emphasize
repeatedly
in
my
argument,
that
title
ii
was
addressed
to
a
grave
commercial
problem,
grave
at
the
time
the
act
was
enacted
and
plainly
go
through
it.
nor
should
we
forget,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
that
congress
in
addressing
itself
to
that
commercial
problem
was
also
keeping
faith
with
the
promise
declared
by
the
continental
congress
that
all
men
are
created
equal.
now
the
failure
to
keep
that
promise
lay
heavy
on
the
conscience
of
the
entire
nation,
north
as
well
as
south,
east
as
well
as
west.
nor
do
i
overlook
the
difficulties
of
adjustment
that
accommodation
to
this
act
may
require,
difficulties
that
may
bear
heavier
on
some
regions
than
upon
others.
nor
do
i
overlook
the
need
for
a
spirit
of
co-operations
and
mutual
understanding
in
facing
those
difficulties.
we
should
solve
the
problems
as
one
people
and
thus
escape
the
consequences
of
the
sins
of
the
past,
unless
we
act
in
the
spirit
of
lincoln
second
inaugural,
without
malice,
with
charity
and
perhaps
above
all
without
that
spirit
of
false
self-righteousness
that
enables
them
who
are
not
themselves
without
fault,
to
point
the
finger
at
their
fellows.
happily,
the
difficulty
of
the
constitutional
issues
here
is
not
equal
to
their
importance.
title
ii
as
we
see
it,
rest
upon
the
powers
delegated
to
congress
by
article
i,
section
8,
clause
13
of
the
constitution
--
clause
3
of
the
constitution,
to
regulate
commerce
among
the
several
of
states,
and
upon
the
power
delegated
by
clause
17
of
the
same
article,
to
enact
laws
that
are
necessary
and
proper
to
effectuate
the
commerce
power.
the
constitutionality
of
title
ii
under
those
provisions
is
sustained
by
principles
that
are
so
familiar
because
they
have
been
enacted
over
and
over
again,
applied
indeed
throughout
our
entire
history,
going
back
as
mr.
justice
black
has
pointed
out
a
moment
ago
to
the
opinion
of
chief
justice
marshall
and
given
some
argument.
we
do
not
seek
the
extension
of
any
existing
principles
here
a
fortiori,
we
invoke
no
new
doctrine.
i
think
it
will
be
helpful
if
at
the
beginning,
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
even
that
i
think
in
principle
mr.
justice.
i
should
deal
with
this
at
more
length
in
the
course
of
my
argument.
i
suggest
even
that
at
principle
isn't
known,
the
same
point
was
involved
in
the
safety
appliance
act
requiring
the
equipment
put
on
cars
–
that
weren't
moving
in
interstate
commerce.
and
in
a
case
involving
the
inspection
of
cattle,
which
is
also
applicable
to
a
cattle
that
you've
never
moved
out
of
the
state.
but
i
do
intend
to
deal
with
that
point
a
little
more
detail
if
i
may
later
after
i've
explained
the
general
plan
of
the
statute
and
the
general
principles
which
we
think
stay
in
that
position.
the
particular
application
to
this
set
of
facts
and
to
practice
of
segregation
is
of
course
now.
the
title
ii
of
the
act
is
printed
in
our
brief
in
the
heart
of
atlantic
case,
beginning
at
page
63
that
i
think
it
might
be
useful
to
go
through
the
plan
rather
quickly
in
order
to
get
oriented
with
respect
to
the
particular
provisions.
section
201,
you
will
observe
on
page
63,
declares
the
right
of
all
persons
to
full
and
equal
enjoyment
of
the
goods,
services,
facilities
and
so
forth,
of
any
place
of
public
accommodation
as
defined
in
this
section,
without
discrimination
by
reason
of
race,
color,
religion
or
national
origin.
now
the
term
place
of
public
accommodation
is
then
defined
in
sub-section
b
of
the
character
of
places
as
listed,
and
those
places
are
places
of
publication
within
the
statute.
if
one
of
two
alternatives
is
satisfied,
either
if
its
operations
affect
commerce
or
if
discrimination
or
segregation
by
it
is
supported
by
state
action,
then
sub-section
c
and
d
define
supported
by
a
state
action
and
affect
commerce.
the
definition
of
supported
by
a
state
action
is
at
the
top
of
page
65,
you
will
note
that
it
follows
essentially
the
language
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871.
that
section
is
not
involved
in
either
of
these
two
cases.
the
government
did
not
proceed
in
either
case
in
the
lower
court
and
does
not
proceed
here,
on
the
theory
that
this
discrimination
is
supported
by
a
state
action
within
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
provision
which
may
or
may
not
be
as
broad
as
the
meaning
in
state
action
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
simply
make
no
argument
on
that
point
because
we
think
this
application
of
the
statute
is
clearly
brought
within
the
commerce
provisions.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
frankly,
i
find
that
alternative
so
unlikely,
that
if
we
were
to
lose
on
that
ground,
i
might
despair
a
persuasion
in
the
court
on
the
other
ground
because
i
think
that
what
is
so
much
stronger.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
is
--
it
would
seem
to
me
that
to
reach
that
question
here,
one
would
have
to
conclude
that
this
definition
of
the
state
action,
reaches
the
operation
of
any
restaurant
or
any
motel
or
hotel,
without
knowing
anything
about
its
relationship
to
the
state.
now
conceivably
that
is
true,
that
seems
to
me
to
go
even
farther
that
the
argument
presented
in
the
(inaudible)
cases
and
we
have
thought
it
quite
unnecessary
in
performing
our
duty
to
the
court
to
discuss
the
issue.
theoretically,
i
think
the
court
is
free
mr.
justice
to
go
ahead
and
consider
that
issue.
if
it
should
reach
it,
we
would
feel
remise
and
our
duty
as
counselor
is
not
to
discuss
it,
but
in
our
judgment,
it's
unnecessary
if
they
consider
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
by
the
case
of
--
statement
was
intended
to
be
essentially
the
same
as
mine
to
what
the
government
was
not
relying
on
that
point
because
it
made
no
concessions
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
201
(d)
and
no
concessions
with
respect
to
constitution
but
it
hadn't
offered
any
proof
on
the
point,
that
it
wasn't
raising
it.
but
certainly
it
would
be
proper
for
the
court
under
those
circumstances
i
think,
and
to
say,
well,
the
government
can't
stand
on
this
theory,
if
it
brings
another
case
standing
on
the
theory,
we
will
adjudicate
it,
but
we're
not
going
to
prevent
them
to
raise
that
issue
this
late.
mr.
archibald
cox
again,
i
think
exactly
the
same
as
my
statement
mr.
justice,
if
we
don't
imply
anything
about
the
meaning
of
the
section
201(d).
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
hope
the
point
is
clear.
mr.
archibald
cox
on
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
so
unless
one
was
prepared
to
say
that
the
failure
of
a
state
to
put
a
stop
to
something,
i
meant
in
the
language
of
201
(d),
that
the
segregation
was
carried
on
under
color
of
any
state
law,
statute,
ordinance
or
regulation.
i
would
think
that
was
an
exceedingly
difficult
point
to
make.
i
don't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
because
the
point
may
come
out
in
the
future
but
i'm
certainly
not
arguing
it
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
much
more.
mr.
archibald
cox
much
more.
and
i
would
have
three
questions.
i
would
first
have
the
problems,
and
facts,
we
don't
even
know
here
that
this
hotel
has
a
license
for
example.
second,
i
would
have
to
face
the
meaning
of
the
statute
which
is
the
same
language
as
the
civil
rights
act
and
therefore
perhaps
would
be
said
to
be
enacted
with
the
rubric,
and
then
finally,
one
would
come
to
the
section
5
of
fourteenth
amendment,
alright.
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
no
need,
it
seemed
to
counseling
the
court
below,
there's
no
need
to
traverse
that
path.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true,
because
the
birmingham
statute
as
a
matter
of
interest,
it
was
involved
in
the
other
cases
as
now
been
repealed.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
the
case
of
a
motel,
there
is
in
effect,
a
congressional
declaration
that
its
operations
affect
commerce,
if
one
further
point
is
established
mr.
justice
douglas,
and
--
201
(b),
refers
to
any
inn,
hotel
or
motel
or
other
establishment,
which
provides
logging
to
transient
guests.
and
if
the
particular
establishment
provides
lodging
to
transient
guests
and
fits
that
general
description,
then
it
is
deemed
to
affect
commerce.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would.
provided
it
held
itself
out
--
held
itself
out
to
accept
a
transient
guest
indiscriminately.
obviously,
i
have
here
in
this
application,
a
much
easier
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
no!
i
realize
that.
it
means
that
the
hotel
says,
we're
willing
to
take
anyone
and
therefore,
it
may
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
or
any
other
day
receive
transient
guest
or
it
may
even
if
it
hasn't
done
it
for
many
years,
if
the
policy
of
discrimination
is
embolic
–-
it
then
maybe
transient
--
could
apply
to
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
it
doesn't
serve
transient
guest,
then
i
would
think
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
i
don't
think
it's
saying
that
that
isn't
the
only
kind
of
motel
that
will
affect
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
here
--
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution.
(voice
overlap)
i
think
that's
the
only
kind
of
hotel
or
motel
to
which
the
statute
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
i
have
to
accept
that
as
a
resulting
from
the
statement
in
subdivision
b.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
wouldn't
have
thought
so
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
think
the
reason
for
the
other
establishment
affecting
transient
guest
being
put
in
is
that
to
avoid
the
problem
of
what
is
a
motel,
what
is
an
inn
and
to
reach
other
establishment.
and
then
in
--
again
i
think,
the
fact
that
the
particular
establishment
affects
transient
guest,
tends
to
link
it
more
closely
than
it
would
otherwise
be
linked
to
commerce,
and
therefore
to
bring
it
farther
within
the
ambit
of
federal
regulation.
now
mr.
justice
white,
it
says
what
might
in
the
hotel
affect
commerce
in
the
constitutional
sense
even
if
it
didn't
accept
transient
guest.
certainly,
it
might
affect
it
through
a
number
of
courses
of
relationship.
one
would
be
that
it
received
its
food
from
out
in
the
state.
another
sense
in
which
it
might
affect
commerce
is
that
it
might
be
a
wholly
impractical
line
for
congress
to
distinguish
between
dallas
hotels
that
do
receive
interstate
travelers
and
those
that
don't
has
of
any
particular
time.
and
of
course,
the
congress
is
free
to
consider
the
practical
problems
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
we
--
they
do
--
i
find
out
in
this
particular
case.
now,
if
i
might
refer
to
the
remaining
provisions
of
section
201
(c)
in
conjunction
with
section
201
(b),
you
will
note
that
the
second
kind
of
establishment
of
place
in
public
--
a
second
kind
of
establishment
defined
as
a
place
for
public
accommodation
is
a
restaurant,
cafeteria,
lunchroom
or
other
facility
engaged
principally
in
selling
food
for
consumption
on
the
premises
and
so
forth.
and
c
2
indicates
that
that
kind
of
establishment
is
to
be
determined
to
affect
commerce
and
therefore,
to
be
a
place
of
public
accommodation
within
the
meaning
of
the
prior
subsections.
if
it
serves
or
offers
to
serve
interstate
travelers
that's
not
involved
in
any
of
these
cases,
or
a
substantial
portion
of
the
food
which
it
serves
or
gasoline
or
other
products
which
it
sells
has
moved
in
commerce.
subdivision
3
deals
with
various
places
of
entertainment,
in
movie
theatres,
other
legitimate
theatres
to
sports
arenas
and
the
like.
and
they
are
deemed
according
to
c
3
to
affect
commerce
if
they
customarily
present
films,
performances,
athletic
teams
and
so
forth,
sources
of
entertainment
that
move
in
commerce.
then
the
fourth
division
which
scarcely
concerns
us
here
relates
to
establishments
which
are
functionally
or/and
physically
interrelated
with
any
of
the
forgo.
mr.
archibald
cox
provided
it
sells
no
gasoline.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
you
are
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
then
the
statute
would
not
reach
it.
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
was
--
i
don't
recall
very
precisely.
i
think
that
one
of
the
practical
considerations
that
congress
undoubtedly
would
have
taken
into
account
--
would
have
been
that
there
--
a
problem
of
discrimination
is
much
less
in
the
case
of
that
kind
of
establishment.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
i
didn't
mean
--
i
didn't
mean
any
constitutional
problem.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
would
say
slightly
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
--
those
have
been
--
and
entertainment
facilities.
those
have
been
the
big
problem.
i
wouldn't
be
prepared
to
say
that
there
is
no
problem
--
mr.
archibald
cox
has
been
the
other
kind.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
that
is
what
i
can
get
on
to
it,
was
the
problem
that
was
emphasized
before
congress
that
commercial
problems
affecting
all
the
states
resulting
from
that
kind
of
discrimination,
it
was
the
focal
point,
though
not
the
exclusive
point
in
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
i
would
like
and
i
think
it'll
be
helpful
in
the
long
run
if
i
may
continue
the
exposition
of
the
provisions
of
the
statutes.
i've
noted
already
201
(d).
201
(e)
simply
provides
an
exemption
for
private
clubs,
and
we
need
not
concern
with
it
or
ourselves
with
it.
202
is
another
substantive
provision
which
applies
even
to
retail
stores
mr.
justice
harlan
in
the
unlikely
event
that
segregation
or
discrimination
in
a
retail
store
is
required
by
state
law.
i
know
of
none
but
that
section
--
i'm
simply
emphasizing
is
broader
than
the
public
accommodation
section.
203
simply
declares
that
no
person
shall
violate
the
right
to
equal
public
accommodations,
and
that
completes
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
statute.
the
procedural
provisions
become
in
part
and
in
the
next
case
and
i'd
like
to
revert
them
to
them
now.
section
204
authorizes
a
private
suit
for
enforcement
of
the
right
to
equal
treatment
in
places
of
public
accommodation
but
there
are
number
of
things
that
should
be
noted
about
it.
in
the
first
place,
any
such
private
action
must
be
referred
to
a
state
agency
if
there
is
a
state
agency
empowered
to
prevent
discrimination
in
such
a
place.
and
even
if
there
is
none,
it
may
be
stayed
for
reference
to
the
community
relation
service,
an
agency
intended
to
--
by
persuasion
to
induce
voluntary
compliance
in
the
elimination
of
discrimination
before
it
goes
to
judgment.
furthermore,
and
this
is
most
important.
you
will
note
that
the
action
that
may
be
brought
at
the
bottom
of
page
65
is
a
civil
action
for
preventive
relief.
there
is
no
right
in
any
private
person
or
anyone
else
to
bring
an
action
for
damages
and
a
fortiori,
there
is
no
provision
for
criminal
prosecution.
this
is
emphasized
when
one
comes
to
section
206
which
authorizes
the
suit
by
the
attorney
general
which
was
instituted
by
a
counterclaim
in
this
heart
of
the
claimant
case.
for
he
has
authorized
when
he
finds
a
pattern
or
practice
of
resistance
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
any
of
the
right
secured
by
this
title,
to
bring
a
civil
action
requesting
such
preventive
relief
as
he
deems
necessary.
and
the
limitation
of
the
statute
to
preventive
relief
is
emphasized
in
section
207
(a)
over
--
on
207
(b)
over
on
page
69,
which
provides
that
the
remedies
provided
in
this
title
shall
be
the
exclusive
means
of
enforcing
the
rights
based
on
this
title.
the
only
question
on
the
merits
in
either
of
these
cases
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
substantive
provisions
of
title
ii
particularly
to
those
impinging
first
on
inns,
hotels,
motels,
like
places
offering
accommodations
to
transient
guest.
and
then
second,
those
applicable
to
restaurants
and
other
eating
places
which
receive
a
substantial
portion
of
the
food
served
in
interstate
commerce.
as
i've
said,
we
think
that
the
constitutionality
of
both
provisions
rest
squarely
upon
the
commerce
power
aided
by
the
necessary
in
profit
clause.
but
the
major
premise
of
our
argument
is
the
familiar
role
that
the
powers
delegated
to
congress
by
the
commerce
and
necessary
in
profit
clauses,
authorized
congress
to
regulate
local
activities,
at
least
activities
that
are
local
when
separately
considered.
even
though
they
are
not
themselves,
intestate
commerce,
if
they
have
such
a
clause
in
substantial
relation
to
commerce
that
their
regulation
may
be
deemed
appropriate
or
useful
to
foster
or
promote
such
commerce
or
to
relive
it
of
burdens
and
obstructions.
the
minor
premise
of
our
argument
is
that
congress
to
which
the
economic
question
does
raised
is
primarily
committed
at
ample
bases
upon
which
defined
that
racial
discrimination
in
inns,
in
the
one
case
--
inns
and
motels
in
the
one
case,
restaurants
in
the
other,
does
in
fact
constitute
a
source
of
burden
or
obstruction
to
interstate
commerce.
and
of
course
from
those
premises,
the
conclusion
would
follow
that
this
is
a
legitimate
exercise
of
power
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
put
it
in
this
--
the
answer
--
direct
answer
is
no.
and
i
would
state
the
principle.
it's
cited
in
my
brief
at
a
number
of
cases
and
i
shall
refer
to
it
a
little
bit
later.
but
i
would
say
that
the
principle
is
that
if
the
person
challenging
the
act
of
congress,
can
show
that
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
a
practical
factual
conclusion
that
this
thing
that
it
did.
i
hear
the
prohibition
of
racial
discrimination
or
segregation
in
certain
places
linked
to
commerce,
that
it
had
no
tendency,
could
not
reasonably
be
found
to
have
a
tendency
to
foster
or
promote
commerce
or
to
relieve
it
of
burdens
or
obstruction.
then
this
court
should
invalidate.
now
i
don't
think
that
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
looking
at
the
record
before
congress,
unquiet
the
tenth
and
do
stand
on
the
record
made
before
congress
here.
but
i
should
point
out
that
under
many,
many
decisions,
the
question
is
simply
whether
the
fact
do
exist
--
or
might
exist
and
the
presumption
is
that
they
do
and
there
is
no
need
for
congress
or
a
state
legislature
to
make
any
such
record
indeed
that's
been
held
with
respect
to
both
in
case
cited
in
my
brief.
but
here,
the
record
was
made
and
we
do
cited,
and
we
think
that
these
show
that
there
was
ample
basis
for
concluding
that
this
segregation
in
all
these
kinds
of
establishment
did
create
--
was
creating
a
grave
national
problem.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right.
and
the
question
--
the
fact
at
findings
are
not
necessary,
it
was
held
by
this
court
in
the
carolene
products
case,
the
fact
that
there
need
be
no
hearings,
no
legislative
investigation
was
held.
i
think
the
case
is
grovey
against
townsend,
somebody
against
townsend
coming
through
one
of
the
southern
states
involving
tobacco
legislation.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
don't
that
think
the
change
in
the
form
of
the
bills.
i
give
shall
argue
at
more
length
in
the
second
case
where
this
argument
is
interjected
by
the
appellees,
i
was
going
to
try
to
lay
out
the
general
foundation
for
what
was
done
in
this
case
and
come
to
these
specific
objections
later,
but
i
think
that
it's
quite
that
the
record
was
made
here
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
think
it's
apparent
from
the
statute
as
i
will
argue
that
there
was
no
shift
in
the
congressional
analysis,
i
would
also
say
that
although
the
practice
in
recent
years
has
been
to
make
both
record
and
has
often
been
to
make
the
findings
that
the
practice
as
chief
justice
stone
pointed
out
in
united
states
against
darby
has
often
been
the
other
way
or
probably
more
often
than
it
has
been
this
way
and
certainly
this
court
has
made
it
playing
over
and
over
again
that
the
findings
are
not
the
prior.
the
findings
make
it
a
lot
easier
for
the
solicitor
general,
i
agree.
mr.
archibald
cox
during
the
1930s,
the
president,
i
think
went
back
to
early
elizabethan
recitals
of
whereas
is.
in
the
intervening
period,
it
wasn't
done
and
of
course
as
justice
black
said,
it
is
just
almost
never
done.
i
think
one
could
almost
say
without
fear
of
contradiction
is
never
done
in
state
legislation.
it's
somewhat
a
short-term
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
don't
--
i
really
don't
think
i
need
consideration
at
the
point
mr.
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
may
be.
the
difficulty
is
that
we
all
know
that
one
of
the
basic
unspoken
predicates
of
the
agreement
on
the
constitution
involved
to
some
acceptance
that
the
national
government
had
no
concern
with
slavery
and
i
hesitate
to
agree
with
you
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that,
it
seemed
to
me
there
might
be
some
room
for
argument
on
that.
the
second
one
is,
i
think
it
is
very
dangerous
to
say
that
anything
congress
can
do
under
the
commerce
clause
today,
that
is
a
regulation
of
any
specific
person
or
local
activity
that
it
may
reach
today,
it
could
have
reached
on
--
in
1789
and
conversely,
that
anything
it
couldn't
reach
at
1789,
it
can't
reach
today
because
while
the
principles
are
constant.
but
what
we
are
concerned
with
today
is
the
free-flow
of
goods
as
this
counsel
suggested
quoting
from
the
federal.
and
what
we're
concerned
with
the
--
is
the
application
of
principle
laid
down
by
chief
justice
marshall
just
a
few
years
later.
still
the
facts
change,
things
affect
in
the
interstate
commerce
today
that
may
not
have
affected
earlier.
therefore,
i
prefer
to
confine
myself
to
what
affects
commerce
now
as
to
the
other,
it
may
or
may
not
be
true.
i
do
think
that
the
principles
are
constant
that
we
invoke
no
new
principle.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
if
the
end
is
legitimate
and
the
means
are
reasonably
adapted
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
nor
can
it
be
said
here
that
the
prohibition
of
segregation
in
this
establishment
is
not
a
means
reasonably
adapted
to
freeing
interstate
commerce
from
obstructions
and
burdens,
the
permissible
objective
that
your
honor
refers
to.
after
the
recess,
i'll
turn
directly
to
the
factual
evidence
bearing
upon
the
appropriateness
of
the
means
to
the
end.
