mr.
marshall
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
marshall
no.
it
would
deal
with
the
--
it
would
deal
with
the
things
that
were
obstructions
to
interstate
commerce
under
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
marshall
yes.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understood
your
honor's
question.
maybe
if
i
could
restate
what
i
--
mr.
marshall
yes.
mr.
marshall
yes.
my
answer
would
be
no,
that
the
fact
that
the
power
that
congress
was
given
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
limited
to
the
implementation
inforcement
of
the
requirements
of
that
amendment.
it
does
not
seem
to
me
to
imply
that
the
power
that
was
given
in
other
parts
of
the
constitution
earlier
to
deal
with
obstructions
to
commerce
whether
local
or
in-commerce
had
been
curtailed.
i
see
no
reason
in
interpreting
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
suppose
that
the
role
expressio
unius
exclusio
alterius
applied.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
indeed,
i
wonder
mr.
justice
whether
that
is
--
mr.
marshall
well,
perhaps
not.
isn't
the
argument
very
similar
to
that?
mr.
marshall
well,
part
of
my
answer
must
be
to
repeat
what
i
said
a
moment
ago
that
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
one
should
draw
from
the
conclusion
that
congress
was
given
an
additional
power
and
intent
to
curtail
its
power
to
enact
legislation
which
it
appears
in
fact
rating
the
legislation
to
be
reasonably
adapted
to
dealing
with
a
commercial
problem.
now,
so
far
as
what
was
the
dominant
motivation
here
goes,
what
was
the
constitutional
theory
on
which
the
congress
or
different
congressmen
acted
goes,
i
suggest
that
that
is
irrelevant.
my
own
inference
knowing
something
about
the
legislative
history
would
be
that
congress
accepted
the
advice
that
it
was
not
--
while
each
congressman
must
satisfy
himself
that
he
was
--
he's
doing
his
duty
of
conforming
to
the
constitution
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
congress
to
commit
itself
to
any
particular
theory.
that
so
far
as
--
that
had
to
be
decided,
that
was
something
for
the
government
to
do
or
anyone
else
to
do
including
the
court
in
determining
the
constitutionality
of
the
legislation.
i
think
that's
the
fact.
i
don't
pitch
my
case
upon
it
because
i
don't
think
that
it's
a
proper
inquiry
for
the
court
to
do
more
than
--
look
at
the
legislation,
to
inquire
whether
this
is
a
useful,
appropriate,
necessary
in
that
sense
necessary
way
of
dealing
with
a
commercial
problem
if
it
is
--
mr.
marshall
well
i
don't
think
they
had
to
do
with
(inaudible)
relevant
commerce.
i
think
again
that
--
mr.
marshall
but
i
think
mr.
justice,
it
is
the
doctrine
that
has
been
applied
over
and
over
again.
it
was
applied
in
the
mccray
case,
to
the
(inaudible),
i
think
it
was
applied
until
there
was
no
discussion
in
the
labor
board
cases.
mr.
marshall
well,
i
think
the
record
must
be
admitted
to
show
a
very
great
concern
with
and
with
the
problem
of
the
effect
of
discrimination
on
commerce,
a
great
concern
with
the
fact
that
it
was
a
national
commercial
problem.
and
when
you
turn
to
the
evidence
that
was
before
congress,
you'll
find
that
there
was
overwhelming
evidence
to
that
effect.
mr.
marshall
quite,
quite.
mr.
marshall
and
of
course
when
congress
was
addressing
itself
to
the
national
commercial
problem,
it
had
to
take
into
account
other
aspects
of
this.
if
there
are
alternative
approaches
to
the
problem,
then
it
had
to
choose
between
them.
and
i
suppose
that
there
are
--
in
theory
at
least,
were
alternative
approaches
to
the
problem.
a
rigorous
enough
suppression
by
the
vended
obstruction
to
interstate
commerce
but
clearly,
congress
is
not
required
to
choose
any
particular
alternative
provided
if
there's
not
have
been
a
specific
innovation
of
the
constitution.
now
here
--
this
was
--
i'd
like
to
emphasize
and
go
into
it
in
a
little
detail,
a
very
real
national
commercial
problem.
and
the
record
shows
that
beyond
the
peradventure
of
a
doubt.
let
me
talk
about
it
first
in
somewhat
general
terms
and
then
turn
specifically
to
the
motels
and
hotels
that
are
involved
here
and
thereafter
specifically
since
we're
looking
at
the
act
in
general,
the
general
plan
of
the
act
and
to
the
effect
upon
restaurants
and
the
like.
i
simply
say
parenthetically
first
that
of
course
this
general
principle
that
mr.
justice
clark
referred
to
a
moment
ago,
has
been
applied
to
the
activities
of
hotels
and
motels,
and
restaurants
under
numerous
statutes,
the
sherman
act,
to
the
laws
administered
by
the
federal
trade
commission
and
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now,
congress
started
with
the
outstanding
fact
that
i
think
that
of
national
life
during
the
past
decade
perhaps
longer,
the
thrust
or
the
realization
for
negroes
and
in
some
instances
other
minorities,
of
the
promise
that
all
men
are
created
equally.
we're
concerned
here
with
the
commercial
consequences
of
which
where
a
nationwide
scope
and
almost
incredible
proportions.
not
unnaturally,
much
of
that
pressure
that
i
refer
to,
was
settled
on
racial
discrimination
in
places
of
public
accommodation
of
practice
that
was
not
confined
to
any
one
section
of
the
country
or
to
any
particular
type
of
establishment.
congress
heard
evidence
for
example,
in
about
two
months
in
the
spring
and
summer
--
early
summer
of
1963,
that
there
were
634
demonstrations
in
174
cities
and
32
states
in
the
district
of
columbia.
about
a
third
of
those
were
concerned
solely
with
discrimination
in
places
of
public
accommodation,
others
had
a
broader
scope.
the
effect
of
those
demonstrations
picketing,
boycotts,
other
forms
of
protests,
upon
business
conditions
and
therefore
upon
the
interstate
commerce
was
dramatic.
the
undersecretary
of
commerce
described
the
business
consequences
in
considerable
detail.
but
for
illustrative
purposes,
it's
enough
for
me
to
take
what
happened
in
birmingham
in
the
spring
of
1963.
in
a
four-week
period
extending
from
the
middle
of
april
to
the
middle
of
may,
department
store
sales
is
reported
to
the
federal
reserve
board
were
15%
below
the
level
in
1952,
in
comparable
cities,
they
were
rising.
businessman
stated
that
the
number
of
business
failures
during
that
period
was
greater
than
in
the
great
depression
of
the
1930s.
downtown
stores
reported
that
their
april
sales
were
off
from
40%
to
50%
during
the
period
of
these
demonstrations.
and
the
undersecretary
described
in
his
testimony
that
similar
experiences
at
other
times
in
savanna,
atlanta,
charlotte,
north
carolina
and
nashville,
tennessee.
now
it's
evident
that
any
general
downturn
in
business
--
in
retail
business
will,
if
left
unchecked,
result
in
serious
disruption
of
the
flow
of
goods
across
state
lines.
if
the
retailers
don't
sell,
they
won't
buy.
and
if
they
won't
buy
of
the
demand
for
goods
flowing
in
from
other
states,
of
course,
will
be
checked,
the
flow
of
goods
will
be
dammed
up.
a
top
retail
executive
epitomized
the
commercial
aspects
of
these
demonstrations
very
effectively.
he
said
this
thing
has
frightening
ramifications.
it's
now
become
an
economic
situation
affecting
the
entire
community,
the
whole
city
and
the
whole
country.
i
emphasize
that
he
said
it
was
an
economic
situation
affecting
the
whole
country.
no
less
in
pardon
is
the
impact
to
racial
discrimination,
disputes
and
other
forms
of
civil
unrest,
upon
the
flow
of
investment
and
the
location
of
enterprises.
the
secretary
of
labor
who
had
had
a
study
made
before
testifying
before
congress,
summarized
the
results
of
the
studies
made
by
his
department.
industry
said,
he's
discouraged
from
locating
or
expanding
in
communities
where
equal
opportunity
does
not
exist
and
incidents
have
taken
place
are
likely
to
occur.
lack
of
equal
facilities
for
employees
and
even
the
latent
possibility
of
demonstrations
often
removes
the
locality
from
consideration
as
a
site
for
commercial
or
industrial
expansion.
this
affect
industrial
development
regionally
and
nationally
by
limiting
the
flexibility
and
free
choice
of
business
and
hampering
labor
mobility.
the
evidence
before
the
congressional
committees
was
replete
with
specific
examples
of
that
general
statement
by
the
secretary
of
labor.
the
most
dramatic
was
the
experience
in
little
rock,
arkansas.
in
the
two
years
before
the
racial
crisis
in
that
city,
little
rock
could
gain
ten
new
plants
where
it's
almost
$3.5
million
and
creating
a
thousand
new
jobs.
in
the
next
two
years,
a
comparable
period,
there
was
no
new
industry
located
there
employing
more
than
15
employees.
even
industrial
development
in
the
whole
state
of
arkansas
seems
to
have
been
affected.
in
the
previous
two
years,
they
gain
business
worth
$248
million.
in
the
next
two
years,
the
volume
was
cut
to
$190
million.
now,
i
have
no
argument
in
this
case.
to
argue
that
the
general
impact
upon
interstate
commerce
of
such
widespread
disputes
growing
out
of
racial
segregation
is
alone
sufficient
to
support
title
ii.
because
title
ii
does,
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
in
my
argument,
also
require
with
respect
to
each
of
the
kinds
of
business
regulated,
some
mixes
between
bank
establishment
in
interstate
commerce.
what
i
do
say
with
respect
to
this
general
evidence,
is
two
things.
first
that
it
shows
that
the
general
impact
to
these
disturbances
arising
out
of
racial
discrimination,
was
not
merely
social
and
morals,
and
nobody
denies
that
aspect
of
it,
but
that
it
was
national
and
commercial.
and
second,
that
the
importance
of
the
relationship
between
any
individual
establishment,
and
interstate
commerce
is
made
out
in
accordance
with
section
201
(c),
is
to
be
judged
in
the
light
of
the
fact.
that
any
--
that
its
practices
and
any
incidents
that
might
occur
there,
would
be
part
of
a
complex
and
interrelated
problem
affecting
interstate
commerce
when
they
were
added
together
all
over
the
country.
i
come
now
if
i
may
to
the
specific
problem
of
the
relationship
between
discrimination
in
hotels
and
motels
in
interstate
commerce.
you'll
recall
at
section
201
(b)
and
(c),
provide
that
any
hotel
or
motel
or
like
establishment
that
accepts
transient
guest,
shall
be
deemed
to
affect
interstate
commerce,
and
through
that
provision
to
be
a
place
of
public
accommodation.
the
appellant
blindly
falls
in
that
category,
it's
not
only
concededly
a
motel,
but
75%
of
its
guest
come
from
out
of
state
and
it
advertises
out
of
state.
the
testimony
before
congress
provided
literally
overwhelming
evidence,
that
discrimination
by
hotels
and
motels
impedes
interstate
travel.
and
i
suggest
that
there
is
no
possible
doubt
since
the
edward's
case
or
before
the
edward's
case
that
interstate
travel
by
men
and
women
is
interstate
commerce.
we've
summarized
the
testimony
in
our
brief,
and
i
refer
to
it
very
shortly
here.
again,
the
secretary
of
--
undersecretary
of
commerce,
dealt
chiefly
with
the
point,
he
can
concluded
after
studied
by
the
department
of
commerce,
not
only
that
interstate
travel
was
made
incredibly
more
difficult
for
negroes
by
which
--
by
reason
of
discrimination
in
hotels
or
motels,
but
that
its
volume
as
a
whole
was
sharply
curtailed
by
the
unavailability
of
adequate
public
accommodation.
the
administrators
of
the
federal
aviation
agency
testified
to
the
same
effect.
the
witnesses
--
these
witnesses
and
others,
described
the
problem
in
some
detail
and
you
have
the
references
from
our
brief.
suffice
it
to
say
because
i
think
it
epitomizes
the
point,
that
on
a
motor
trip
between
washington
d.c.
and
miami,
florida,
the
average
distance
that
was
found
between
accommodations
of
reasonable
quality
open
to
negroes
was
141
miles.
and
when
we
think
of
the
frequency
by
such
we
go
by
other
hotels
and
motels
open
to
everyone,
the
significance
of
a
three
or
four-hour
drive
between
the
hope
of
accommodation
is
very
significant
indeed.
and
it
further
repaired
that
those
accommodations
that
were
available
to
negroes
were
on
the
whole
likely
to
be
small
so
that
after
driving
three
or
four
hours
one
might
well
find
no
vacancy
sign,
and
have
another
equally
lengthy
drive
ahead
of
it.
similar
--
i
use
this
only
as
an
illustration,
i
want
to
emphasize,
similar
problems
according
to
the
testimony
exists
in
other
parts
of
the
country.
segregation
in
hotels
and
motels
has
an
even
more
dramatic
effect
upon
the
sites
chosen
for
conventions
but
of
course
account
for
a
large
volume
in
interstate
travel.
dallas,
texas
for
example,
founded
that
--
could
it
benefited
very
much
from
the
voluntary
opening
of
its
hotels
to
conventions
where
there
was
no
segregation.
at
the
atlanta
convention
bureau,
within
one
day
after
14
atlanta
hotels
desegregated,
received
commitments
--
not
fillers
but
commitments,
from
organizations
expecting
over
3000
delegates
which
would
not
have
gone
to
atlanta
if
segregation
were
continued
to
be
practiced.
again,
new
orleans
found
the
--
an
american
legion
convention
expecting
50,
000
people
transferred
to
another
city
because
new
orleans
could
not
guarantee
equal
public
accommodations.
finally,
this
kind
of
restrain
has
a
most
marked
effect
upon
the
volume
of
interstate
travel.
they
won't
do
to
say
well
–-
well,
people
will
go
somewhere
else.
in
the
first
place,
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
unlikely,
but
in
the
second
place
of
course
any
practice
that
distorts
the
flow
of
commerce.
and
it
prevents
it
from
going
where
flowing
freely
if
congress
thinks
it's
desirable
to
flow
freely,
is
itself
a
restraint
on
interstate
commerce,
and
something
within
the
power
of
the
congress
to
deal
under
the
proposition
that
i
stated
earlier.
mr.
marshall
i
say
that
the
movement
of
people
from
state-to-state,
is
movement
–
in
commerce,
yes,
i
hesitate
a
little
to
say
that
the
people
are
commerce
but
it's
certainly
movement
in
commerce.
mr.
marshall
squarely
whole,
squarely
--
mr.
marshall
city,
in
new
york
against
miln
as
shown
in
one
of
our
two
briefs.
it
was
overruled
in
either
the
passenger
tax
cases
at
the
head
burning
cases,
i
forgot
which
one.
it's
pointed
out
in
the
footnote
in
our
brief.
mr.
marshall
yes.
well
then
--
then
you
may
be
in
somewhat
a
special
category.
mr.
marshall
well
i
understand
that
it
was
overruled
earlier,
the
references
in
our
brief.
i
think
edwards
is
the
first
case
that
can
be
said
squarely
to
have
embraced
the
proposition
that
the
movement
of
people
across
state
lines,
is
interstate
commerce.
mr.
marshall
yes,
but
i
take
it
that,
if
okies
are
commerce,
so
are
other
people
traveling
across
state
lines.
i
had
intended
to
indicate
the
factual
evidence
relating
the
restaurants,
but
in
view
of
the
passage
of
time,
perhaps
i
better
save
that
for
the
next
case,
and
move
on
here.
simply
to
summarize
on
the
factual
point,
we
think
there
was
ample
evidence
on
which
congress
could
conclude
that
the
racial
practices
in
hotels
and
motels
like
places,
did
have
a
very
substantial
effect
upon
the
movement
of
people
in
interstate
commerce,
and
that
therefore
this
statute
has
applied
to
them
is
a
measure
adapted
to
fraying
interstate
commerce
from
restraints
and
burdens.
now
of
course
once
that
conclusion
is
reached,
at
the
size
of
the
establishment
is
obviously
irrelevant
and
of
the
reliance
fuel
case
determined
there.
the
fact
that
congress
has
prohibited
hotels
and
motels
from
discriminating
against
all
guests,
rather
than
against
interstate
guests,
does
not
invalidate
the
statute
to
require
a
traveler
to
carry
a
cache,
and
show
that
he's
interstate,
would
itself
be
a
burden
on
congress.
furthermore,
to
require
the
negro
interstate
traveler
to
prove
that
he
was
traveling
in
interstate
commerce
would
itself
be
a
form
of
discrimination
of
(inaudible)
as
the
former
practice.
mr.
marshall
because
this
establishment
--
mr.
marshall
that's
true.
and
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
marshall
yes.
mr.
marshall
that's
true.
but
i
would
--
i
would
make
the
same
argument
under
the
commerce
clause.
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that
without
going
over
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
yes.
mr.
marshall
this
one
does,
but
the
statute
draws
no
distinction
and
i
think
there
is
no
constitutional
distinction.
mr.
marshall
the
second
--
that's
true.
the
second
case
of
course
relies
on
a
ground
of
coverage
not
present
in
this
case,
at
least
not
shown
to
be
present.
and
that
is
that
we
rely
on
the
fact
that
this
is
an
establishment
which
receives
indirectly
on
shipments
of
food
in
interstate
commerce.
i
wonder
mr.
chief
justice,
i
might
borrow
a
few
minutes
from
my
time
in
the
other
case.
mr.
marshall
i
will
make
--
will
deal
in
the
mcclung
case,
the
next
case,
with
the
special
arguments
made
there
under
the
commerce
clause
since
they
aren't
raised
here,
i
thought
it
better
to
postpone.
now
i
come
to
the
other
constitutional
objections.
once
it
is
established,
that
the
enactment
of
title
ii
is
valid
under
the
commerce
clause,
then
of
course
the
arguments
based
on
the
ninth
and
tenth
amendments
disappear.
because
it
has
been
law
since
martin
and
hundreds
of
lessee
and
mcculloch
and
maryland,
that
if
legislation
may
be
sustained
under
one
of
the
granted
powers
then
the
ninth
and
tenth
amendments
do
not
cut
off
but
would
otherwise
be
the
power
of
congress.
and
that
proposition
was
re-enunciated
in
the
darby
lumber
case
for
unanimous
court
by
mr.
chief
justice
stone.
the
argument
that
congress
violated
the
fifth
amendment
has
equally
little
merit.
certainly,
there's
no
taking
of
property
for
a
public
use.
the
regulation
of
the
conduct
of
a
business
is
not
a
taking.
appellant
say
that
they
will
lose
profits
as
a
result
of
this
regulation.
experience
rather
indicates
the
contrary,
but
assuming
that
that
is
true,
and
still
it
is
clearly
been
held
that
subjecting
a
man
to
regulation,
otherwise
proper
along
with
all
other
similar
businesses
does
not
violate
the
fifth
amendment
simply
because
he
loses
money.
nor
does
the
prohibition
of
racial
discrimination
take
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
over
and
over
again,
the
court
has
sustained
and
enforced
statutes
prohibiting
various
forms
of
racial
discrimination.
the
bob-lo
excursion
case
dealing
with
the
excursion
--
on
the
great
lakes,
on
the
case
here
involving
continental
airlines,
and
discrimination
in
the
employment
a
few
years
ago,
the
thompson
case
dealing
with
restaurants
in
the
district
of
colombia,
the
blanton
case
dealing
with
restaurants
that
were
part
of
the
transportation
service
of
a
bus
line
and
i
could
go
on
and
add
numerous
others.
appellant
also
argues
that
the
act
violates
the
thirteenth
amendment.
it's
enough
to
point
out
that
the
appellant
is
a
corporation.
but
surely
it
would
turn
the
world
quite
upside
down
for
anyone
to
seriously
suggest
that
the
thirteenth
amendment
was
intended
to
prohibit
either
congress
or
the
state
governments
from
guaranteeing
negroes
equality
of
treatment
in
places
of
public
accommodation.
and
alice
i
think,
even
at
the
end
of
her
long
journey
through
the
looking
glass,
would
have
been
surprised
to
be
told
that
the
restaurants,
other
places
of
public
accommodation
in
33
states
in
the
year
1964,
held
in
involuntary
servitude,
and
that
the
anglo-american
common
law
for
centuries
has
subjected
to
slavery,
innkeepers,
hack
man,
carriers,
(inaudible),
furriers,
all
kinds
of
other
people,
holding
themselves
out
to
serve
the
public.
normally
do
to
say
that
well,
those
are
businesses
affected
with
the
public
interest.
because
the
thirteenth
amendment
abolishes
slavery
in
businesses
affected
with
the
public
interest,
just
as
might,
just
anywhere
else.
of
course
the
real
answer
is,
that
this
appellant,
even
if
it
were
a
person
could
stop
holding
himself
out
as
a
motel
willing
to
do
business
with
the
public.
and
as
long
as
one
is
free
to
stop,
then,
there
is
no
forced
labor
and
no
violation
of
the
thirteenth
amendment.
now
the
point
--
remaining
point
concerns
the
civil
rights
cases
of
1882.
as
i
have
argued,
this
legislation
as
applied
in
this
case
is
valid
under
the
commerce
clause,
then
the
standing
of
that
decision
is
not
drawn
in
question.
the
court
made
it
clear
that
the
act
of
1875
was
drawn
in
another
view.
and
i
take
it
the
respect
in
which
it
was
drawn
in
another
view,
was
that
it
covered
a
great
many
enterprises
--
theaters,
local
public
conveyances,
which
on
any
facts
before
the
court
or
any
facts
known
to
congress,
probably
did
not
then
affect
interstate
commerce.
in
other
words,
the
statute
was
framed
in
another
view
in
this
instead
it
was
much
broader.
mr.
marshall
under
my
--
i
would
suppose
mr.
justice
that
a
theater
which
in
1880
had
employed
only
local
actors,
which
had
only
local
scenery,
which
had
only
local
stage
hands
if
you
will
in
(inaudible)
would
not,
it
certainly
wouldn't
have
affected
interstate
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute,
and
i
think
it
would
have
been
a
question
of
whether
it
affected
interstate
commerce
in
any
sense.
now,
i
expect
the
very,
great
many
establishments
of
that
kind
in
that
day.
and
of
course,
if
such
an
establishment
exists
today,
the
act
doesn't
reach
it.
what
i'm
saying
is,
if
that
statute
covered
a
great
many
things
that
were
not
shown
anywhere
to
affect
commerce,
and
that
the
court
therefore
had
to
consider
perhaps
two
question.
one,
whether
the
statute
was
valid
in
the
broader
applications
which
was
presented
in
the
1882
case,
and
then
later
it
had
to
consider
which
was
presented
in
the
butts
case.
in
a
sense
the
question
of
separability
whether
congress
would
have
wished
it
to
be
applied
to
those
places
which
congress
constitutionally
could
reach
and
the
court
held
that
it
was
not
separable,
that
it
had
not
been
addressed
to
the
commercial
problem.
mr.
marshall
yes
sir,
the
situation.
mr.
marshall
well,
there's
a
curious
little
quirk
about
then.
the
facts
appeared
to
be
these.
the
civil
rights
case
is
of
course
involved
in
number
of
cases.
two
or
three
of
them
got
to
the
court
several
terms
back
in
1878
term
or
1879
term.
at
that
time,
a
brief
was
filed
by
attorney
general
devens
and
then
assistant
attorney
general.
and
there
is
in
one
passage
that
--
of
course
they
were
very
short
briefs
as
they
were
in
those
days.
there
is
one
passage
there
that
alludes
to
the
fact,
the
act
is
being
applied
to
a
railroad
which
would
of
course,
and
he
said
in
effect,
be
subject
to
regulation
under
the
commerce
clause.
then
he
went
on
and
argued
the
whole
case
under
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
amendment.
then
that
brief
was
apparently
forgotten,
as
i
suppose
our
brief
sometimes
are.
and
when
the
case
came
on
for
argument
two
years
--
four
years
later,
i
think,
solicitor
general
phillips
filed
another
brief
and
that's
the
one
that
most
people
look
at.
and
that
brief
makes
no
reference
to
commerce
whatsoever.
then
of
course
the
court,
as
opposed
to
the
conclusion
of
the
opinion
--
i
won't
stop
to
read
it
but
you
will
find
very
close
to
the
conclusion
of
the
majority
opinion,
a
statement
that
no
argument
under
the
commerce
clause
is
pressed
upon
it.
i
suggest
that
i
gave
at
least
one
of
the
reasons
earlier,
now
i
don't
mean
to
be
disingenuous
that
maybe
different
views
about
the
commerce
clause
today
than
they
were
then.
but
i
do
submit
most
seriously,
that
many
of
these
differences
are
differences
in
the
factual
conditions
that
exist
today
and
not
any
difference
in
the
principle.
now
that's
why
i
suggest
that
very
sincerely
--
the
print
case
here
falls
within
the
principle
laid
down
by
chief
justice
marshall
and
gibbon
and
ogden
and
that
is
virtually
as
old
as
the
constitution
itself.
mr.
marshall
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
