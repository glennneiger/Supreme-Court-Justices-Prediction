justice

black
did
you
initiate
your
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
on
the
certificate
of
the
government
in
a
case
to
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what,
i
didn’t
get
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
before
the
congress
had
relied
expressly
on
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
the
fact
that
it
is
defined
in
such
a
way
that
it
relies
on
the
fourteenth
amendment,
could
this
court
hold
a
law
unconstitutional
because
an
argument
was
made
that
the
litigant
was
only
depending
on
the
commerce
clause?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
support
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
congress
would
define
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
show
that
it
only
intended
to
rely
on
the
commerce
clause.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
was
limiting
at
cases
that
would
come
under
the
commerce
clause.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
follow
you
on
that.
but
let's
suppose
that
the
congress
had
specifically
stated
in
its
law.
we
are
exercising
this
power
under
the
commerce
clause,
we
wish
a
scope
to
reach
no
further
than
the
commerce
clause
would
reach.
would
you
say
then
that
it
could
be
decided
or
anything
except
the
commerce
clause?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
would
be
bound
by
what
it
has,
would
we
not.
even
if
it
passed
one
to
saying
if
we
want
this
to
reply
to
nothing
except
goods
that
the
shift
in
interstate
commerce
are
--
that
would
come
under
that
clause,
would
we
not
be
bound
by
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that's
an
analogous
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
meant
that
--
i
asked
you
this
question
because
you've
been
arguing
fourteenth
amendment.
do
you
think
that
congress
did
rely
on
the
fourteenth
amendments
or
that
its
definition
of
what
should
be
the
crime
is
limited
to
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
the
testimony
under(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
howitzer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
did
not
refer
at
all,
did
you,
to
what
congress
could
do
under
the
5th
section
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
under
the
necessary
and
public
laws
of
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
which
case
are
you
referring
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
haven't
discussed
it
all
of
the
things,
it
seems
to
me
the
most
imported
for
both
sides.
that
is
the
theory
implication.
starting
the
(inaudible)
given
in
argument,
held
on
and
mr.
chief
justice
used
before
he
became
chief
justice
in
three
or
four
cases,
various
other
cases,
congress
has
not
owned
any
right
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
itself
as
the
right
to
regulate
local
activities,
wholly
local
with
interstate,
purely
intrastate,
if
the
congress
concludes
like
it
is
concluded
if
those
would
adversely
affect
the
interstate
commerce
or
that
they
would
fail
to
give
it
the
protection
and
fostering
care
which
congress
is
supposed
to
giving.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
not
touched
on
that
yet.
and
that
for
me
is
a
very
important
part
of
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right,
it
was
not
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
and
for
one
reason
or
another,
that
case
was
decided
as
it
was.
but
it
does
not
have
to
be
actually
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
under
the
line
of
cases,
actually
beginning,
was
given
argument,
which
i
have
said,
congress
has
the
right
to
take
care
of
the
interstate
commerce
to
foster
it,
to
care
for
it
and
to
see
that
it
is
not
adversely
affected
in
any
way,
even
going
so
far
as
to
regulate
the
purely
intrastate
railroad
rates
in
every
state
in
the
union.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
--
they
resolved
the
activities
of
that
town.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
can
--
the
sullivan
case,
which
i
happen
to
be
familiar
with,
where
the
druggist
had
received
the
drug
in
his
drugstore.
all
the
connection
that
that
drugstore
had
had
with
it
was
the
drug
after
they
got
into,
but
was
held
that
because
those
had
moved
in
interstate
commerce.
under
the
line
of
decisions
which
i
have
just
mentioned
to
you,
that
congress
had
the
right
to
regulate
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
not
apply
it
here,
that
to
me
--
it
seems
to
me
as
your
point.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
will
take
that
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
iha
matter
of
fact,
i
presume
most
legislation
in
the
country
is
in
fashionable
state
and
national
without
findings
by
congress.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
comply
with
that
thought,
marshall
statement,
that
the
end
be
legitimate
and
so
forth,
the
end
is
legitimate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
cannot
be
said
that
it's
illegitimate
end
and
try
to
carry
out
a
policy
which
the
constitution
demands.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i'd
like
to
have
it
answered
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
indirectly.
so,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
that
is
a
crucial
issue
here
as
to
whether
you've
can
--
we
can
say
that
congress
are
wrong
in
thinking,
depriving
a
life
--
a
segment
of
people,
the
right
to
stop
at
night
has
an
interesting
summary,
whether
they
had
a
right
to
pay
that
that
was
--
put
a
burden
on
commerce
that
congress
–-
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i've
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
read
the
facts
in
your
case
that
was
having
a
motel,
right
along
the
highway
is
unreasonable
in
this
case,
people
go
up
and
down
all
over
the
country,
down
that
highway,
no
motel
is
there
and
i
understand
your
position.
do
you
believe
that
the
(inaudible)
that
you
have
a
highway
law,
75%
of
the
(inaudible)
comes
from
that
side
of
the
state,
one
way
or
the
other?
and
you
have
advertising
asking
them
to
come.
so,
you'll
probably
--
in
this
case,
the
former
opinion,
going
back
to
the
very
beginning
of
the
century,
19th
century.
whether
or
not,
congress,
we've
got
a
right
to
say
that
congress
is
fully
right
in
saying
that
if
these
people
are
deprived
the
right
to
spend
the
night
on
that
trip,
they
would
--
that
could
likely
create
a
burden
on
the
commerce.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
in
atlanta?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
travel
with
any
colored
people
from
the
southern
part
of
this
country
back
up
to
washington?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
might
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
that
they
have
the
right
to
do
it?
if
congress
had
a
right
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
if
it
does
pertain
to
commerce,
then
it
would
create
a
burden
on
the
discrimination
to
be
practiced,
if
congress
denied
the
power
to
protect
commerce
because
of
the
fact
that
alleged
to
discrimination.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
did
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
of
any
law
on
regulating
commerce
that
doesn't
affect
the
individual?
justice
hugo
l.
black
based
on
the
ideas
that
(inaudible)
individual
liberty.
every
regulation
of
the
(inaudible)
every
regulation
of
the
public
utility,
every
other
commercial
regulation
affects
the
liberty
of
(inaudible),
so
if
congress
reaches
its
conclusion
to
the
best
advantage
of
all
to
be
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not
true
with
reference
to
the
wage
and
hour
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
not
what
congress
does.
if
the
question
on
both
and
that
--
but
that's
immaterial.
what
you
have
--
you
are
asking
in
effect
that
the
(inaudible)
put
back
in
the
rule.
the
argument
in
(inaudible)
--
the
argument
was
made
there
like
you
are
making
here
that
probably
regulates
congress
for
some
purpose.
you
can
regulate
it
to
protect
child
labor,
--
the
court
held
it
later
on
--
