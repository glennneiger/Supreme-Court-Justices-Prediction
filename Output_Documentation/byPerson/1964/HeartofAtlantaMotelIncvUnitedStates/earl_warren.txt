mr.
rolleston,
you've
indicated
that
you
don't
intend
to
get
to
your
argument
on
the
commerce
clause
until
rebuttal.
don't
you
think
that
in
as
much
as
you
both
agree
that
the
thrust
of
this
case
is
under
the
commerce
clause
and
as
much
as
you're
the
top
side
of
the
case
that
we
ought
to
hear
your
argument
on
the
commerce
clause
before
we
hear
from
the
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
earl
warren

may.
