justice
potter
stewart
is
this
your
only
brief
one
--
joined
with
a
jurisdiction
statement?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
word
motel
defined
in
the
act?
justice
potter
stewart
no
definition
of
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
motel
is
written?
justice
potter
stewart
we
used
to
call
it
a
blue
bottle
case,
something
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
as
part
of
the
period
of
the
government
did
the
arguing
only
needed
this
act
was
--
in
this
case,
he's
arguing
only
that
the
act
is
constitutional
and
the
constitutional
exercise
of
the
congress
--
there's
other
debate
maybe
interesting
but
it
isn't
going
to
end
with
this
lawsuit.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
nothing
in
this
record
about
state
action,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
that
specifically
in
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
to
state
--
to
state
our
case,
if
you
are
likely
to
state
our
case
on
the
commerce
clause.
justice
potter
stewart
civil
rights
act
cases
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
exactly.
because
they
are
the
fact
you
stipulate.
justice
potter
stewart
general,
i
don't
suppose
the
--
maybe
i'm
wrong
that
the
definition
of
affecting
commerce
mainly
transients,
is
not
exclusive
as
to
what
affects
commerce.
well,
the
terms
did
declare
in
the
year
that
the
motel
affects
commerce
if
the
service
transient
guest.
do
you
think
that's
to
the
exclusive
--
the
exclusive
definition
of
affecting
commerce?
what
if
it
doesn't
serve
transient
guest?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
congress
is
also
saying,
this
is
all
--
the
only
kind
of
a
motel
that
will
affect
commerce.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that
--
do
you
think
the
statue
means
to
limit
the
applicability
of
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
--
solely
the
transient
motel.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
no
problem
based
on
the
cases
which
have
come
here.
there's
--
justice
potter
stewart
no,
what
i'm
saying,
i'm
simply
suggesting
that
you're
suggesting
the
right
answer
that
this
--
the
department
stores
don't
--
having
to
actually
presented
a
problem
of
discrimination
or
segregation
anywhere,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
isn't
sleeping
facilities
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
certainly
that's
what
edwards
against
california
--
justice
potter
stewart
squarely
whole.
