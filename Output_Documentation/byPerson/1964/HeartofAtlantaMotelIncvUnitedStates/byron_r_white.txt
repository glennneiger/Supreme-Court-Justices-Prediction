justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
the
court
put
the
commerce
clause
expressly
aside
in
connection
with
one
of
the
defendants?
justice
byron
r.
white
one
of
the
parties?
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
hold
the
argument
in
the
lower
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
he
--
it
did
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
according
to
your
position
of
course,
all
the
issues
relevant
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
a
moment
ago,
you
got
some
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
rolleston
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
rather
converse,
i
gather
you're
suggesting
that
the
government
might
rely
on
both
the
commerce
clause
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
suppose
it
was
a
converse,
may
the
government
rely
on
the
commerce
clause
without
some
indication
that
congress
in
fact,
exerted
the
commerce
power
in
the
enactment
of
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
he's
--
as
i
read
the
brief,
the
government
has
made
a
demonstration,
at
least
attempted
a
demonstration
that
in
fact
it
affirmatively
appears
that
congress
did
rest
the
statue
on
the
commerce
clause,
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
your
position
is
that
in
the
--
in
enacting
this
statute,
congress
did
exerted
commerce
clause.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
motel
that
serves
any
accepted
tranches?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
i
just
--
in
apartment
house
or
apartment
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
so
that
saks
fifth
avenue
which
deals
in
all
kinds
of
interstate
goods
assuming
that
it
cut
out
its
restaurant
and
they
chose
not
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
was
that
the
--
judge
discussion.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
words
were
involved
that
the
federal
court
that
to
say
the
federal
congress?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
they
be
desegregated?
do
you
have
any
idea?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
had
something
to
do
with
the
stability
of
the
commercial
operations?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
is
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
weren't
an
adequate
accommodation,
would
you
say
there
are
and
were
â€“
if
there
weren't
those
adequate
accommodations,
the
question
would
be
different?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
in
1960
--
justice
byron
r.
white
1960
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
does
involve,
would
have
been
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
not
my
question.
my
question
was
since
you
only
had
two
actual
occupants
since
august
the
3rd,
you
wouldn't
have
any
swimming
pool
with
real
--
and
so
that's
not
the
question.
it's
whether
what
effect
it
would
since
--
justice
byron
r.
white
not
at
all.
