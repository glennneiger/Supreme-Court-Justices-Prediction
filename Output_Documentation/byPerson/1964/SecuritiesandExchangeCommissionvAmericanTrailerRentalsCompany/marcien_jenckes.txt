mr.
marcien
jenckes
i'm
pleased
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
speak
as
in
my
certiorari
in
the
case,
because
i
argued
last
december
in
our
first
circuit
in
boston,
an
identical
situation
involving
the
appeals
from
the
district
court
judges'
refusal
to
transfer
a
chapter
xi
case
to
chapter
x.
i
represented
there
and
here
the
state
mutual
life
insurance
company
and
george
patton
fund
new
boston,
and
his
management
company.
the
time,
i
filed
my
brief,
there
were
two
other
cases
beside
this
one
and
that
one,
which
were
pending,
the
same
question,
one
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
one
in
the
second
circuit.
unfortunately,
our
case
in
the
first
circuit
argued
last
december
has
not
yet
been
decided.
the
fifth
circuit
case
argued
in
february
of
this
year
was
decided
just
a
week
ago
and
the
action
of
the
district
judge
was
reversed
principally
because
of
the
fact
that
the
plan
there
involved
only
provided
for
a
15%
dividend
to
the
creditors
for
as
the
equity
position
was
increased
from
a
deficit
to
something
over
a
million.
and
i
find
no
difficulty
in
seeing
why
the
circuit
court
said
this
is
not
in
the
best
interest
of
creditors.
mr.
marcien
jenckes
that
is
the
case
of
the
crumpton
builders
case
and
it
has
not
yet
been
published
in
the
federal
report.
mr.
marcien
jenckes
securities
and
exchange
commission
against
crumpton
builders,
inc.
mr.
marcien
jenckes
crumpton,
cr-u-m-p-t-o-n
is
cited
in
the
footnote
on
page
3
of
my
brief
among
the
other
cases
and
the
decision
is
dated
october
21,
1964.
mr.
marcien
jenckes
they
said
it
should
be
transferred
to
the
chapter
x
under
the
provisions
of
sections
328.
there
are
many,
many
differences
between
that
case
and
no
one
at
bar
or
even
more
so
between
that
case
and
the
first
circuit
case.
mr.
marcien
jenckes
it
depends
on
the
first
circuit
on
the
--
mr.
marcien
jenckes
there's
one
in
the
second
circuit
which
is
on
the
current
list
and
another
one
in
the
first
circuit
where
i
appeared.
the
one
in
the
second
circuit
is
in
re
canandaigua
--
in
the
matter
of
canandaigua
enterprises,
western
district
of
new
york,
second
circuit
case
number
29012.
mr.
marcien
jenckes
neither
of
them.
my
case
in
the
first
circuit
is
pertinent
against
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
so
they're
seeking
to
review
the
decision
of
mr.
justice
day
of
the
district
court
at
rhode
island,
which
i
hope
your
honors
will
read
because
it's
such
a
carefully
well-written
and
thoroughly
investigatory
opinion
on
the
basis
of
which
he
exercises
discretion
not
to
transfer.
some
of
the
opinions
in
the
other
cases
of
to
say
at
least
brief,
not
exhausted.
and
in
221
sets
up
at
961,
you
will
find
judge
day's
opinion,
which
is
perfectly
on
review
since
last
december.
mr.
marcien
jenckes
221,
your
honor.
mr.
marcien
jenckes
yes.
mr.
marcien
jenckes
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
marcien
jenckes
the
fifth
circuit
case
as
i
say
is
easily
understandable
because
those
among
other
facts
come
strictly
within
the
amended
deposition
of
chapter
xi.
that
the
chapter
xi
plan
must
be
in
the
best
interest
of
creditors,
not
fair
and
equitable
and
obviously
a
plan
with
only
15%
dividend
under
those
circumstances,
it
is
not.
in
the
burton
case
of
the
first
circuit,
it's
even
stronger.
because
in
that
plan,
all
of
the
debt
must
be
paid
before
the
stock
has
any
voter
control
at
all.
the
plan
is
designed
and
presented
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
up
there
and
it
is
therefore,
i
say
impossible
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
more
impossible
as
a
matter
of
law
to
say
as
the
commission
contends
that
every
time
you
have
a
public
investigation,
it
must
be
transferred
to
chapter
x.
the
word
dictates,
the
word
required,
the
one
direct
all
through
their
brief
and
i
say
this
is
very
expanded
reading
of
the
word
“may”
in
the
section
328,
which
is
a
very
discretionary
word
and
a
discretionary
word
that's
even
limited
to
cases
where
the
judge
finds
that
the
action
should
originally
have
been
started
in
chapter
x
rather
than
in
chapter
xi.
the
second
circuit
has
twice
reached
the
same
conclusion
in
the
grayson-robinson
stores
where
apparently
the
lower
court
refused
the
transfer.
the
solicitor
general
did
not
choose
to
seek
review
and
then
the
second
circuit
in
re
transmission
that
was
in
1954,
that
refusal
to
transfer,
a
certiorari
petition
was
filed
and
was
denied
by
this
court.
i
realized
fully
that
the
american
trailers
case
is
the
only
one
for
decision
here.
but
those
involved
in
this
case,
a
very
important
principle
which
has
never
been
decided
before
by
this
court
and
that
is
the
principal
urge
by
sec,
counsel
for
the
appellant,
that
whenever
there
is
a
public
investor
situation
involved,
it
must
be
in
chapter
x.
and
secondly,
that
you
can't
in
chapter
xi
have
a
plan
unless
creditors
gets
this
priority
that
is
all
of
the
assets
before
the
equity
holders
get
anything.
the
authoritative
words
of
“may”,
the
rest
to
that
language
is
read
into
the
sec
from
sorts
or
other.
and
i'm
calling
your
honor's
attention
to
the
fact
that
an
essential
jurisdiction
allegation
of
chapter
x
is
that
you
can't
get
the
proper
relief
on
xi.
secondly,
that
there
is
a
provision
in
chapter
x
itself,
section
146
(2),
saying
that
a
showing
in
chapter
x
that
adequate
relief
can
be
obtained
in
xi
will
result
in
the
dismissal
of
the
chapter
x
proceeding.
that's
always
the
indications
of
congress,
indicate
a
preference
to
me
which
puzzles
me
as
to
where
is
the
source
that
says
that,
every
time
there's
a
public
investor,
there
must
be
a
chapter
x
proceeding.
the
commission
stands
that
the
chapter
xi
proceeding
is
limited
only
the
cases
where
there
are
trade
creditors.
there
is
just
an
imposition
on
the
statute,
because
nowhere
is
there
any
suggestions
in
the
statute
or
elsewhere
that
chapter
xi
is
limited
to
that
situation.
the
statutory
word
that
should
be
pointed
out
here
with
respect
to
what
constitutes
an
arrangement
are
very
broad.
section
306
(1)
of
chapter
xi
defines
the
arrangement
as
any
plan
for
the
satisfaction
or
extension
of
the
time
for
payment
of
its
unsecured
debts
upon
any
terms.
this
was
all
unsecured
debts.
and
of
course,
in
this
case
and
clearly
in
my
first
circuit
case,
unsecured
debt
is
all
that
is
involved.
i
might
point
out
here
that
indicated
on
page
18
of
my
brief,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
noted
in
the
general
stores
case
in
350
that
this
court
has
given
no
consideration
to
the
significance
of
the
1952
amendments.
mr.
marcien
jenckes
your
honor?
mr.
marcien
jenckes
it
was
a
dissenting
opinion
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
judge
bernstein
dissented
in
the
general
stores
case.
judge
harlan
did
not
participate,
but
the
point
i
make
is
that,
i
don't
think
the
opinion
contradicts
what
justice
frankfurter
said
in
that
you
have
not
fully
considered
the
import
of
the
1952
amendments.
particularly,
that
when
which
has
been
mentioned
here
that
provided
specifically
that
the
plan
shall
not
be
refused
confirmation,
because
the
interest
of
equity
holders
are
maintained.
in
other
words,
it
is
invidious
the
fact
that
you
are
compromising
debts,
but
stockholders
may
still
retain
something.
it
is
not
necessary
as
indicated
by
the
enactment
of
that
new
amendment
in
section
366
in
1952
that
there
be
a
strict
priority
under
a
chapter
xi
proceeding.
i
think
that
it
is
important
also
to
realize
here
that
any
question
of
mismanagement,
violation
of
the
securities
act
of
33
or
other
necessary
disciplinary
actions
or
causes
of
actions
against
management
have
really
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
here.
the
only
question
involved
on
this
writ
of
certiorari
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
lower
courts
have
viewed
the
district
court,
abused
his
discretion,
acted
beyond
the
reasonable
bounds
in
denying
the
transfer.
and
that
is
why
i
think
it
is
worthwhile
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
issue
--
issues
with
reference
to
this
other
matters
can
proceed
just
as
effectively
in
chapter
xi
as
they
can
in
chapter
x.
and
i
might
here
interrupt
my
own
thought
to
refer
to
a
question
that
mr.
justice
goldberg's
answered
and
i
think
mr.
justice
white
asked
the
question
along
the
same
line,
that
is
the
suggestion
made
and
agreed
to
by
the
sec's
counsel
that
under
chapter
xi
if
the
transfer
order
it
is
not
made
to
chapter
x,
the
sec's
interests
ceases
it.
i
do
not
subscribe
to
that
you
honor
because
it
seems
to
me
that
ever
since
the
very
early
case
1940,
u.
s.
realty
case
decided
before
the
1952
amendments.
it's
been
perfectly
clear
that
the
sec
is
entitled
to
intervene
in
any
of
these
reorganization
proceedings,
it
has
intervened
a
number
of
times.
mr.
marcien
jenckes
the
positions
to
intervene
had
been
granted
in
various
places.
it
intervened
in
this
case
below
and
it
intervened
in
the
transmission
case.
mr.
marcien
jenckes
well,
my
thought
is
your
honor
that
it
was
--
the
intervention
was
committed
without
any
limitations
on
its
purpose.
the
only
thing
it
did
affirmatively
was
to
move
the
328
motion,
but
it
was
there
--
at
the
proceedings,
it's
all
truly
the
same
as
i
understand
this
case.
and
even
in
the
transmission
case,
i
know
that
the
sec
was
asked
to
participate,
but
the
sec
declined
to
give
the
justices'
advice.
so,
i
think
that's
what
happened
in
this
case,
because
i
wasn't
in
on
the
trial,
but
i'm
quite
sure
that
in
this
case,
sec
was
asked
for
its
advice
and
did
not.
my
point
simply
is
that
if
there
was
occasion
for
the
sec
on
account
of
any
reason
to
intervene
in
the
chapter
xi
proceeding,
it
can
do
so.
i
understand
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
they
don't
do
it
is
because
of
possible
budgetary
problem,
but
that,
your
honor,
has
no
reason
for
saying
that
every
time
a
public
investor
is
here,
there
must
be
chapter
x.
this
is
the
report
that
i
wanted
to
get
across
in
an
answer
to
a
suggestion
made
that
the
sec
should
limit
its
participation
only
to
the
328
motion.
i
think
it
can
go
farther,
if
the
circumstances
want
it,
even
though
for
some
reason
or
another,
it
has
to
date
not
tried
to.
mr.
marcien
jenckes
intervention?
the
transmission
case
was
since
52
your
honor.
the
intervention
in
my
rhode
island
case
was
general.
the
intervention
in
this
case,
i'm
quite
sure
was
a
general
intervention
not
limited
to
the
section
328,
and
so,
i
believe
there
is
considerable
inquiry
to
indicate
that
intervention
if
it's
desired
by
the
sec
and
we
had
on
any
subject
where
the
public
may
be
involved
or
should
be
entitled
to
be
heard
even
under
a
chapter
xi
plan.
of
course,
you
must
realize
also
that
the
only
other
case
that
involves
section
328
has
been
before
this
court
is
the
general
stores
case
and
it
did
came
up
in
exactly
the
opposite
way
for
this
case.
in
other
words,
the
lower
courts
had
ordered
a
transfer
and
your
honors
granted
the
certiorari
and
affirmed
setting
up
there
in
that
first
opinion
under
section
328,
this
tests
--
the
needs
to
be
served,
the
thing
that
gives
the
judge,
district
judge
under
the
statutory
word
“may”
and
with
that
test
the
needs
to
be
served,
the
duty
and
opportunity
to
investigate
situation
and
see
what
is
for
the
best
interest
of
creditors.
that's
the
test
entirely.
so
i
say
here
that
there
really
isn't
any
proper
reason
for
implying
into
section
328,
but
there's
always
discretionary
language.
a
duty
on
the
district
judge
to
transfer
just
because
there
are
public
investors
and
this
is
the
trust
as
i
understand
it,
of
the
commission's
first
point.
the
second
question
raised
by
them
is
just
a
matter
of
having
a
strict
priority
and
it
has
been
ordered
that
arises
from
the
fact
that
until
1952,
the
words
fair
and
equitable
appear
in
chapter
xi.
and
those
words
had
acquired
a
word
of
art
meaning.
i
don't
know,
as
a
result
of
two
earlier
decisions,
northern
pacific
against
boyd
1913
case
and
a
case
against
the
los
angeles
lumber
company
in
1939
case.
boyd
case
was
before
any
of
the
federal
statutes
dealing
with
reorganizations
and
it
was
a
very
bold
effort
on
the
part
of
a
controlling
stockholder
to
cut
out
a
judgment
of
creditor
by
foreclosing
a
mortgage.
and
the
case
in
los
angeles,
lumber
company
case
was
that
an
old
section
77
(b)
which
of
course
is
the
predecessor
of
our
present
chapter
x.
and
in
that
case
your
honor,
the
plans
provided
for
and
this
was
emphasized
in
your
honor's
opinion.
the
plan
provided
that
the
holders
of
the
whistler's
equity
got
23%
of
the
vote.
now,
this
awful
different
from
the
situation
here
today
and
i'm
not
surprised
that
the
case's
case
--
the
way
it
did,
but
it's
neither
authority
–
well,
this
case
does
not
look
like
--
nor
for
the
general
proposition
that
in
the
chapter
xi
cases
strict
priority
that
is
all
for
creditors
and
nothing
for
equity
holders
until
the
creditors
are
paid
is
applicable
in
chapter
xi.
i
think
in
the
last
paragraph
of
the
commission's
reply
brief,
they
recognize
this
fact
that
for
buyers
with
the
fair
and
equitable
standard
under
chapter
x
is
no
longer
required
in
chapter
xi,
but
they
argue
it
by
judicial
fiat
the
same
standard
should
still
apply.
congress,
really
wanted
that
standard
to
apply
in
chapter
xi,
it
seems
to
me
would
have
been
so
easy
for
them
to
say
so.
biased
position,
the
commission
relies
on
the
facts,
attempts
to
take
the
position
that
if
it
cannot
force
to
transfer
to
chapter
x,
its
interest
in
the
proceedings
(inaudible)
relying
on
the
claim
as
i
mentioned
in
my
talk
to
you
your
honor.
and
i
repeat
again,
if
i
may,
that
(inaudible)
decision,
it's
been
clear
that
the
commission
could
approve.
the
protection
which
is
alleged
to
have
been
given
by
chapter
x
can
be
obtained
in
chapter
xi
and
you
will
see
an
indication
of
just
how
this
is
done
and
the
appendix
attached
to
my
brief,
because
it
has
been
done
in
the
rhode
island
case
that
i
refer
to
and
what
i
am
looking
for
here
as
an
amicus
curiea
in
some
kind
of
a
statement
from
this
court
to
the
effect
that
just
as
a
public
investor,
the
appearance
of
public
investors
does
not
dictate
chapter
x.
and
secondly,
that
a
strict
priority
on
the
basis
of
the
northern
pacific
against
boyd
is
no
longer
necessary
in
chapter
xi.
the
sec
is
an
argument
your
honor,
run
to
something
like
this,
as
i
look
at
it.
congress
appeals
the
fair
and
equitable
requirement
that
366
of
chapter
xi
used
to
have,
fair
and
equitable,
a
word
of
that
with
a
special
meaning
including
the
strict
priority
in
payment
of
old
age.
therefore,
they
say,
chapter
xi
cannot
be
used
–
its
priority
is
not
found.
this
to
me
is
a
very,
very
obvious
case
of
non
sequitur,
what
that
third
step
should
be
is
that
in
view
of
members
to
the
act,
the
rule
of
boyd
in
los
angeles
lumber
no
longer
applied.
the
provision
on
which
they
were
based
has
been
taken
out
of
chapter
xi
and
so,
i
say
that
in
the
case
of
an
arrangement
which
by
judicial
determination
is
found
to
be
in
the
best
interest
of
creditors
and
in
deciding
that
fact
the
judges
so
deciding
may
very
well
apply
standards
of
fair
and
equitable,
but
he
doesn't
have
to
think
about
stockholders.
he
doesn't
have
to
think
about
anything
of
the
best
interest
of
the
creditors.
and
here
on
this
particular
case
your
honor,
you
will
have
the
referee,
the
bankruptcy
referee
who
sat
as
a
special
master,
the
district
judge
and
three
appellant
judges,
all
who
found
that
this
was
accomplished
by
this
plan.
this
is
to
me
the
subpoena
should
be
dismissed.
thank
you.
mr.
marcien
jenckes
i
have
one
here,
i'd
like
to
reproduce
it.
mr.
marcien
jenckes
yes,
i
know
your
honor.
