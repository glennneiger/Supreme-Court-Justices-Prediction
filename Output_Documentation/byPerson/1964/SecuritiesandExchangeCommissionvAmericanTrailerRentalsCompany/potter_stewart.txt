the
important
thing
to
remember
in
this
connection
is
that
the
phrase
fair
and
equitable
in
this
context
has
a
fixed
absolute
meaning,
meaning
absolute
priority.
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
mean
what
those
words
mean
in
other
context?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
if
you
have
just
a
simple
case.
you
said
that
fair
and
equitable,
the
fair
and
equitable
concept
requires
that
creditors
be
paid
$0.100
on
$1.
and
of
course,
that's
not
quite
accurate,
because
often
there
just
isn't
$0.100
for
$1
of
debt,
but
it
does
require
that
senior
creditors
be
paid
everything
before
junior
creditors
or
stockholders
get
anything.
justice
potter
stewart
it
does
require
that
much
as
at
least
as
i
understand
it.
but
would
it
be
possible
under
a
chapter
xi
proceeding,
let's
assume
just
one
class
of
creditor
and
one
class
of
stockholders
to
just
turn
the
whole
company
over
to
the
creditors.
now,
that
would
certainly
be
fair
and
equitable,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
wouldn't
that
be
possible
to
do
in
a
chapter
xi
proceeding
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
a
court
could
require
that
they
do
it,
could
not
approve
anything
short
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
without
some
hope
of
retaining
something.
justice
potter
stewart
you
wouldn't
argue
then
that
the
--
for
the
best
interest
of
the
creditors
in
section
366,
chapter
xi,
includes
the
fair
and
equitable.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
used
in
chapter
x
in
which
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
chapter
xi
is
a
great
concession
to
the
existing
management
to
stay
and
preserve
its
equity.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
end
product.
that's
not
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart

justice

justice
potter

trustee
under
chapter
x,
if
the
records
of
$250,000
is
present
for
his
appointment
where
he
has
been
required
appointment.
does
he
always
take
possession?
justice
potter
stewart
he
normally
does.
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
wanted
to
know
if
there
was
a
trustee
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
allow
the
debtor
to
remand.
justice
potter
stewart
as
management
and
to
employ
experience
in
--
.
justice
potter
stewart
if
these
amount
to
a
secured
debt
then
you
lose
your
case,
then
this
obviously
should
have
been
brought
under
chapter
x.
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
the
case
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
simply
upset
the
confirmation
or
did
they
say
that
it
should
be
dismissed
and
brought
on
the
chapter
x?
