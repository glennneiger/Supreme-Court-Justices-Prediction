justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
what
your
first
point
that
you
just
left
would
be
that
even
though
fair
and
equitable
treatment
were
shown
here,
chapter
xi
would
not
apply,
because
it
doesn't
apply
at
all
to
public
creditors.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
now
you're
arguing
that
if
you're
wrong
in
the
broad
front
at
least
it
doesn't
apply
where
fair
and
equitable
treatment
is
not
shown.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
that
it?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yeah.

approach
it
from
different
ends.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
which
you
said
in
previous
cases
unless
i'm
wrong,
the
question
of
transfer
apart
from
your
legal
arguments
as
a
matter
where
--
a
matter
for
the
discretion.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
are
they
under
public
investor?
