mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
involves
the
standards
to
be
applied
in
determining
whether
the
reorganization
of
a
financially
distressed
corporation
should
be
conducted
under
chapter
x
of
the
bankruptcy
act
or
under
chapter
xi.
i'll
discuss
in
some
detail,
the
differences
between
these
two
chapters
that
suffice
at
this
point
to
say,
that
chapter
x
is
the
provision
providing
generally
for
what
are
known
commonly
as
‘big
large
scale
corporate
reorganizations'.
and
chapter
xi
provides
a
summary
procedure,
by
which
the
unsecured
debts
of
a
debtor
maybe
readjusted.
and
there
is
a
provision
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
section
328,
which
authorizes
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
or
any
party
in
interest.
when
a
proceeding
has
been
filed
for
an
arrangement
under
chapter
xi
to
move
the
district
court
to
dismiss
the
proceeding
on
the
ground
that
the
proceeding
should
have
been
brought
under
chapter
x
and
this
court
held
many
years
ago
in
the
united
states
realty
case,
which
is
the
landmark
decision
in
this
field
that
these
two
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
act
are
mutually
exclusive.
and
this
case
arises
out
of
the
district
court's
denial
of
such
a
motion
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
the
specific
question
which
is
presented
in
this
case,
which
has
not
been
before
the
court
before,
is
whether
when
you
have
a
proceeding
which
involves
the
adjustments
of
the
rights
of
public
investor
creditors,
i
want
to
make
that
explicit.
these
are
people
who
have
loaned
money
to
the
corporation,
members
of
the
public
who
have
a
creditor
claim.
the
question
is
when
you
have
a
proceeding
under
which
the
rights
of
those
public
investor
creditors
are
to
be
cut
down
whether
such
a
proceeding
maybe
had
under
chapter
xi
or
whether
as
the
commission
contends
only
under
chapter
x.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
justice,
i
don't
think
we're
embedding
it,
it's
a
phrase
and
perhaps
it
has
not
appeared
before
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
yes.
we're
distinguishing
between
the
ordinary
commercial
trade
creditors,
who
do
business
with
the
company,
who
are
informed
sophisticated
businessmen
and
the
so-called
investor
creditors,
who
put
money
into
a
business
in
the
hope
of
getting
a
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
our
position.
we
think
the
basic
purpose
of
this
chapter
is
to
accomplish
only
arrangements
with
trade
creditors.
that
when
investor
creditors
are
involved,
we
think
that
the
whole
statutory
scheme
is
actually
developed
caused
for
the
invocation
of
the
protective
procedures
in
chapter
x
for
the
benefit
of
public
investors.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
arrangement
in
this
case
is
very
unique,
but
investor
creditors
are
quite
frequent,
public
debentures,
public
bond
holders,
these
are
the
categories
that
we
mean
as
investor
creditors.
i
know
of
no
case
that
involves
the
facts
of
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
we
think
those
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
long
as
members
of
the
investing
public
put
their
money
into
a
business
in
a
credited
position,
we
think
chapter
xi
cannot
be
used.
i'd
like
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
have
a
double
position.
first,
we
think
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
as
i
shall
develop.
we
think
that
plainly
this
is
what
--
pardon
me
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
for
other
reasons
and
in
addition
to
which,
we
think
there
is
this
broader
principle,
which
we
are
urging.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
somewhat
complicated,
i'm
afraid
that
somewhat
lengthy
statement
will
be
necessary.
the
respondent
of
the
american
trailer
rentals
company,
which
i
shall
refer
to
as
the
debtor
was
organized
in
1958
to
engage
in
the
automobile-trailer
rental
business.
this
is
the
business
of
these
little
carts
that
are
attached
to
the
rear
bumpers
of
automobiles.
there
are
four
or
five
feet
long
and
two
or
three
feet
wide.
and
you
see
them
driving
on
the
highway,
the
most
frequently
seen
one
is
manufactured
by
a
firm
called
u-haul
it,
and
they
are
used
either
to
carry
stuff
from
one
city
to
another
or
within
a
locality.
the
business
is
actually
operated
through
a
series
of
service
stations.
what
the
people
engaged
in
this
business
do
is
they
put
trailers
at
various
gasoline
service
stations.
and
if
you
want
to
say,
have
a
trailer
to
go
from
here
to
chicago
--
request
you
to
get
your
trailer
from
a
station
here
and
he
will
make
arrangements,
rent
it
to
you.
and
also,
you
will
be
told
where
in
chicago,
you
will
deliver
the
trailer.
so,
you
have
this
system
of
trailers
moving
back
and
forth
between
the
different
service
stations.
the
debtor
itself
is
one
of
a
group
of
interrelated
companies.
there
were
eight
or
nine
companies
at
one
point
in
the
operations
of
this
business
and
all
of
these
companies
in
1961
were
merged
into
the
debtor.
the
business
was
basically
financed
by
selling
trailers,
individual
trailers,
to
members
of
the
public
and
simultaneously
leasing
back
to
the
company
or
one
of
its
affiliates,
the
use
of
the
trailers.
so
in
other
words,
what
amounts
to
here
was
a
trailer
was
sold
to
the
public
and
he
was
promised
a
certain
rate
of
return
for
the
lease
of
the
trailers.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
court
arose,
i
referred
to
the
system
by
which
the
debtor
had
raised
money
from
the
public,
the
selling
of
a
trailer
and
the
leasing
back
of
the
trailer
to
one
of
the
defendants
affiliated
companies.
they
leased
the
trailers,
the
financial
basis
of
the
leases
were
three-fold.
the
principal
number
of
leases
were
written
on
a
basis
that
they
would
pay
the
owner
of
the
trailer
2%
of
the
cost
of
the
trailer
a
month
for
ten
years.
in
other
words,
24%
a
year
for
ten
years.
another
group
of
leases
were
written
for
a
five-year
period
and
they
promised
them
36%
a
year.
the
third
group
of
leases
which
were
the
minority,
promised
them
35%
of
the
net
profits
allocable
to
the
particular
trailers.
in
the
first
two
types
of
leases,
the
2%
and
the
3%
leases,
the
promised
rental
payments
were
not
in
any
way
tied
to
the
income
either
of
the
company
or
from
the
particular
trailers.
on
this
basis,
the
company
sold
a
total
of
about
5,800
trailers
over
a
3-year
period
to
several
hundred
investors
primarily
in
the
western
states
and
the
total
amount,
which
these
people
paid
for
these
trailers
was
roughly
$3.5
million.
the
trailers
when
they
were
sold
to
the
people
were
not
in
existence.
the
investors
they
paid
$1,000
for
a
trailer.
the
money
however,
was
then
used
by
the
debtor
to
manufacture
the
trailer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
was
the
understanding,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
was
the
understanding.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
a
very
substantial
amount
was
taken
out
of
the
purchase
price
by
way
of
sales
commissions,
it
ranked
roughly
from
30%
to
37%.
so,
of
every
$1,000
that
an
investor
put
in
only
between
$700
and
$630
was
actually
used
to
purchase
a
trailer,
90%
of
these
trailers
were
manufactured
by
a
firm
called
demar,
which
was
an
affiliated
company
of
the
debtor,
it
had
various
interlocking
relationships.
and
in
1960,
the
debtor
gave
demar
the
exclusive
right
to
manufacture
trailers
for
it
for
a
substantial
period.
a
year
later
demar
went
bankrupt
and
at
the
time
demar
went
bankrupt,
the
debtor
had
paid
to
it
$200,000
for
trailers,
which
had
never
been
manufactured
and
another
$140,000
for
trailers,
which
demar
had
manufactured
but
had
not
turned
over
to
the
debtor
and
those
trailers
were
subsequently
lost,
because
demar
had
mortgaged
them.
now,
after
this
company
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
demar,
the
company
that
had
gone
bankrupt
had
not
transferred
the
trailers
to
the
debtor,
it
had
mortgaged
them
and
a
third
person
had
taken
possession
of
the
trailers.
after
this
company
had
sold,
as
i
say,
about
$3.5
million
worth
of
these
interests,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
advised
them
that
they
were
selling
investment
contracts
and
these
were
securities,
which
required
registration.
the
company
made
an
attempt
to
register
the
securities
and
filed
a
registration
statement,
but
the
commission
issued
a
proceeding
to
so-called
‘stop
order
proceeding'
alleging
that
the
registration
statement
contained
false
and
misleading
statements
and
the
registration
statement
was
subsequently
in
effect
withdrawn,
because
the
debtor
consented
to
the
issuance
of
an
order
stopping
the
sale
of
these
securities.
after
this,
a
board
have
attempted
to
register
the
securities,
a
man
named
peters
who
in
1960
had
become
the
executive
vice
president
and
the
principal
officer
of
the
debtor
together
with
some
trailer
owners
organized
a
firm
called
‘capital
leasing
company',
which
will
figure
prominently
in
the
discussion
of
the
recapitalization
plan.
and
capital,
acting
under
a
regulation
of
the
commission,
which
exempts
from
registration.
the
public
sale
of
securities
of
not
more
than
$300,000
proposed
to
exchange
trailers
for
its
capital
stock
on
the
basis
of
issuing
one
share
of
its
capital
stock
for
every
$2
that
the
investor
had
put
into
his
trailer.
and
pursuant
to
this
arrangement,
capital
acquired
about
300
trailers,
at
which
point,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
brought
another
proceeding
against
capital,
this
time
alleging
that
the
circular
by
which
it
was
offering
this
exchange
was
itself
false
and
misleading
and
it
suspended
the
exemption
from
registration
under
which
these
people
had
acted.
now,
a
couple
of
other
little
things,
as
i
mentioned
mr.
peters
took
over
the
management
of
this
--
the
head
of
operating
of
this
company
in
1960
and
sometime
before
that,
approximately
$140,000
had
been
misappropriated
from
the
company.
peters
blamed
this
on
a
former
member
of
the
management,
who
has
since
deceased
and
who
allegedly
died
penniless.
what
had
happened
was,
the
executive
sales
company
another
one
of
the
companies
in
this
complex,
which
was
in
charge
of
the
actual
selling
of
the
trailers
to
the
public
had
received
moneys
from
the
public
for
the
purchase
of
trailers,
but
these
moneys
have
not
been
turned
over
to
demar.
in
other
words,
this
man
had
misappropriated
these
funds,
which
were
under
his
control
and
of
course,
at
the
same
time
however,
executive
sales
was
indebted
to
the
company,
which
had
undertaken
to
manufacture
these
trailers
and
then
when
executive
sales
was
merged
in
the
debt.
the
debtor
undertook
this
obligation.
now,
in
view
of
these
very
heavy
fixed
obligations,
which
this
company
had
undertaken
from
the
outset
of
its
business
paying
24%
and
36%
a
monthly
return
on
the
investment
without
regard
to
the
earnings,
in
view
of
the
very
substantial
commissions
that
have
been
taken
out
of
this
money
that
was
supposed
to
go
into
the
purchase
of
trailers,
it's
not
surprising
that
the
company
was
in
financial
difficulties
for
its
entire
life,
the
company
has
never
operated
a
profit.
the
first
three
years
of
its
operations
ending
in
1961
is
slightly
less
than
that
for
three
years.
they
had
an
aggregate
gross
income
from
the
rental
of
trailers
to
the
public.
that
is
someone
who
rented
a
trailer
to
take
from
here
to
chicago,
$400,000.
in
that
same
period,
the
payments
to
the
trailer
owners
themselves
for
use
of
these
trailers
was
50%
more
than
that
$600,000.
and
then
they
had
very
substantial
additional
expenses
in
addition
to
this.
now
in
order
to
make
these
payments,
the
debtor
found
it
necessary
to
borrow
very
heavily
from
its
offices,
from
its
directors,
from
its
employees.
and
in
addition,
it
borrowed
from
this
affiliated
company
executive
sales
company,
which
was
in
charge
of
the
selling
various
amounts
including
amounts,
which
executive
sales
had
taken
as
a
commission
on
the
sale
of
new
trailers.
so,
it
amounted
to
an
effect
that
at
least
a
portion
of
the
$600,000
that
it
had
paid
to
the
trailer
owners
with
previously
bought
trailers
came
out
of
the
new
trailers
that
were
being
sold.
it
had
needless
to
add
over
the
period
a
very
substantial
net
loss
and
in
addition,
its
problems
were
further
compounded
by
operating
difficulties,
trailers
were
unsatisfactory,
100
trailers
were
mysteriously
lost
and
couldn't
be
located.
so,
in
december
of
1962,
the
company
filed
a
petition
under
chapter
xi
of
the
bankruptcy
act
for
an
arrangement
of
its
unsecured
debts.
and
what
the
plan
proposed
was
to
terminate
the
leases
by
which
the
public
investors
had
given
the
trailers
to
the
company
and
to
offer
the
trailer
owners
stock
in
this
newly
formed
firm
capital
leasing.
the
basis
on
which
the
stock
was
being
offered
was
that
all
the
amounts
which
the
trailer
owners
previously
had
received
by
way
of
rentals,
that
is
the
2%
or
3%
a
month
was
now
to
be
treated
as
though
it
were
a
return
of
capital.
then
they
were
to
give
these
people
$2
per
share,
one
share
of
its
capital
leasing
stock
for
every
$2
that
the
trailer
owner
had
invested
in
the
trailer.
but
again,
what
he
had
invested
in
the
trailer
was
calculated
on
the
assumption,
if
he
bought
a
trailer
for
$1,000
and
had
received
$250
by
way
of
back
rent.
this
was
on
the
assumption
that
they
had
only
$750
in
the
trailer
and
he
would
therefore
get
375
shares
of
capital
stock.
there
was
--
at
this
time,
slightly
more
than
$700,000
which
the
debtor
then
owed
to
these
public
investors.
that
was
just
eliminated,
completely
wiped
out.
in
addition,
the
plan
provides
for
payments
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
under
the
plan
is
silent
as
to
that
but
presumably,
if
someone
does
not
avail
himself
of
this
opportunity
he
has
a
trailer.
that
the
plan
is
also
silent
for
example,
as
to
whether
after
the
plan,
the
trailer
owner
who
does
not
avail
himself
of
the
plan
and
who
has
a
claim
for
$250
back
rent
against
the
debtor
whether
he
can
go
against
capital
leasing
for
that
amount.
and
of
course,
in
terms
of
one
of
the
points
we
make
is
that,
in
terms
of
the
small
investor
who
had
invested
$500
or
$1,000
in
a
trailer,
which
maybe
located
at
a
gasoline
station
hundreds
of
thousands
of
miles
from
his
home.
it's
a
very
difficult
thing
what
he
can
do.
theoretically,
he
can
get
his
trailer
back,
but
the
plan
isn't
clear
and
as
i
say,
it
would
be
virtually
impossible
for
many
of
these
people
to
do.
and
this
is
one
of
our
claims
that
i
will
come
to,
that
this
puts
an
impossible
choice
to
these
people
without
giving
them
adequate
explanations.
the
plan
also
provides
for
giving
stock
to
other
creditors
of
the
company
on
a
slightly
more
favorable,
less
favorable
basis
one
share
for
each
350
of
their
claim.
and
also,
members
of
the
management
who
had
loaned
money
are
to
be
paid
on
an
even
less
favorable
basis.
now,
in
addition,
the
plan
provides
that
the
debtor
will
transfer
its
so-called
“system”.
the
system
is
the
interrelationship
of
operating
agreements
with
the
various
gasoline
stations.
it
will
transfer
its
system
to
this
new
company
capital
leasing
company
in
exchange
for
which
capital
leasing
company
will
issue
to
the
old
stock
holders
of
the
debtor,
not
the
public
investors,
the
old
stockholders
of
the
debtor
roughly
100,000
shares
of
stock.
the
basis
on
which
this
is
proposed
is
a
statement
in
the
plan
that
the
debtor's
system
was
built
by
it
at
a
cost
of
$500,000.
it's
interesting,
however,
that
the
registration
statement,
which
the
debtor
had
filed
a
year
and
a
half
earlier,
in
its
accounting
schedules,
listed
as
an
asset
item
the
cost
of
establishing
these
trailer
rental
systems
at
a
figure
$33,750.
now
on
the
basis
of
various
of
these
facts
and
other
matters,
which
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
set
forth
in
a
supporting
memorandum,
it
moved
to
dismiss
the
chapter
xi
proceedings.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion.
the
commission
appealed
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
in
the
basic
rationale
of
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think,
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
this
is
a
closed
case,
but
even
though
it's
a
closed
case,
they
thought
the
commission
had
not
shown
enough
to
warrant
saying
that
the
district
court
had
abused
its
discretion
in
declining
to
transfer
of
the
case.
now,
in
discussing
the
legal
issues
in
the
case,
my
argument
will
basically
be
composed
i
think
of
three
parts.
the
first
part
will
discuss
the
differences
between
chapter
x
of
the
bankruptcy
act
and
chapter
xi
of
the
bankruptcy
act
and
will
show
why
we
think
the
various
protections,
which
congress
provided
for
the
public
investors
under
chapter
x
make
necessary,
a
transfer
of
this
type
of
case.
a
second
argument
we
will
make
is
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mandatory.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mandatory.
a
second
argument
we
shall
make
is
that
transfer
is
also
required,
because
only
under
the
provisions
of
chapter
x
will
the
creditors
be
guaranteed
to
receive
their
so-called
“fair
and
equitable
treatment”,
a
rule
which
i
will
again
discuss
summary
here.
it
is
the
basic
principle
of
the
reorganization
law
that
a
creditor
cannot
be
given
less
than
his
full
contract
preference,
if
the
stock
holders
are
permitted
to
participate
in
the
business.
and
then,
i
shall
indicate
briefly,
why
we
think
when
we're
dealing
with
this
area
of
the
law,
it
is
important
that
there
be
a
general
principle
and
if
this
kind
of
a
case,
this
particular
type,
that
is
with
public
investor
creditors
should
not
be
generally
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
district
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
will
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
should
not
be
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
least
is
the
second,
we
think
both
are
correct
but
if
the
court
would
disagree
with
this
on
the
first,
we
think
at
least
where
there
is
a
denial
of
fair
and
equitable
treatment.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
fair
and
equitable?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
put
it
this
way
if
i
may
mr.
justice.
the
district
court
would
have
to
be
looked
at
least
--
if
on
the
surface
of
the
plan,
as
we
think
is
clear
here,
the
proposal
which
is
made,
the
proposed
treatment
of
the
public
creditors
does
not
give
them
fair
and
equitable
treatment,
then
we
think
the
plan
chapter
xi
proceeding
would
have
to
be
dismissed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
wouldn't
--
i
can't
accept
that
mr.
justice,
because
i
think
inevitably
when
you
have
a
section
chapter
xi
proceeding,
they
are
going
to
cut
down
in
practically
every
case.
they
are
going
to
cut
down
the
interest
of
the
public
investors,
that's
the
reason
they're
having
an
arrangement,
it's
because
they
want
to
reduce
them.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
they
are
words
of
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
in
the
colloquial
sense
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
a
very
technical
rule.
now
in
the
realty
case,
this
court
had
explained
that
the
reorganization
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
act
were
designed
to
remedy
a
number
of
reorganization
abuses
that
a
grown
up
under
the
old
equity
receiverships
which
antedated
these
provisions.
and
the
court
pointed
out
that
among
the
ables,
which
had
existed
under
the
old
practice
were
and
i'll
just
quote
briefly,
“the
inadequate
protection
of
widely
scatted
security
holders.
the
frequent
adoption
of
plans,
which
favored
management
at
the
expense
of
other
interests
and
which
afforded
the
corporation
only
temporary
respite
from
financial
collapse.
and
the
various
provisions,
which
the
congress
adopted
in
chapter
x,
of
course,
were
designed
to
meet
this
situation.”
perhaps
the
key
reform
of
chapter
x
was
the
introduction
of
the
concept
of
an
independent
trustee.
except
in
cases
where
the
indulgence
of
the
debtor
was
less
than
$250,000,
the
statute
makes
mandatory
the
appointment
of
a
disinterested
trustee,
who
is
to
have
charge
in
the
reorganization.
the
statute
is
quite
explicit
in
making
clear
what
is
meant
by
disinterested.
in
effect,
he
can
have
no
previous
connection
ordinarily
with
the
company.
the
trustee
as
the
court
again
pointed
out
in
realty
is
required
to
make
a
thorough
examination
and
study
of
the
debtor's
financial
problems
and
management,
and
submit
a
report
on
that
to
the
stockholders
and
the
creditors.
in
addition,
the
trustees
specifically
charge
with
investigating
possible
causes
of
action
against
the
management.
and
finally,
it
is
the
trustee
and
not
the
debtor
who
formulates
the
plan
of
reorganization.
he
asks
for
the
advice
of
the
security
holders.
they
make
suggestions,
but
he
formulates
the
plan.
in
chapter
xi,
in
contrast,
everything
about
the
reorganization
is
under
the
control
of
the
debtor.
it's
the
debtor
who
formulates
the
plan,
it's
the
debtor
who
has
complete
control
of
the
reorganization,
and
of
course,
as
mr.
justice
douglas
pointed
out
when
he
was
testifying
as
the
chairman
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
on
these
things,
the
debtor
who
is
in
possession
can
hardly
be
expected
to
investigate
itself.
now,
we
think
that
this
case,
the
record
in
this
case,
shows
the
need
for
a
thorough
independent
investigation
of
this
company.
its
whole
history
has
been
one
of
financial
disaster.
it's
never
operated
at
profit.
one-third
approximately
of
the
moneys
the
public
investors
contributed
were
taken-off
to
high
commissions,
but
that
would
have
been
a
substantial
mismanagement
by
the
prior
--
i'm
sorry,
substantial
misappropriation
by
the
prior
management.
all
the
relations
between
this
company
and
the
affiliated
company
that
was
manufacturing
the
trailer
require
looking
into.
there
is
indeed
moreover,
indication
of
at
least
dubious
practice
in
using
moneys
paid
by
some
trailer
owners
for
buying
their
trailers
to
pay
the
rental
charges
promised
to
early
purchases.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
there
is
--
the
court
may
--
the
court
and
the
statute
says,
the
court
may,
if
necessary,
appoint
a
receiver.
there's
no
discretion
to
appoint
a
trustee.
of
course,
it
was
one
exception,
if
the
company
had
previously
been
in
bankruptcy,
which
is
not
this
company
and
a
trustee
had
been
appointed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
then,
i
think
that
has
reference
to
the
fact
mr.
justice,
if
they
had
previously
--
if
the
company
previously
had
been
adjudicated
bankrupt
and
a
trustee
had
been
appointed.
but
i
don't
believe
that
if
there
has
been
no
proceeding
bankruptcy,
the
court
may
appoint
a
trustee.
i
think
that
all
the
court
may
do
if
necessary
is
to
appoint
a
receiver.
of
course
in
this
case,
there
was
neither
a
trustee
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
unclear.
statute
said
if
necessary,
there's
a
--
one
case
we
know
of
in
which
mr.
jenckes
who
represent
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it's
possible
that
if
the
court
deems
it
appropriate,
he
may
appoint
a
receiver.
but
the
point
is
it's
more
than
just
operating
the
business
mr.
justice.
it's
operating
the
business.
it's
investigating
the
business.
it's
formulating
the
plan.
it's
doing
all
of
these.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
doing
all
of
these
things.
now,
we
think
that
when
you
have
a
company
in
this
shape.
you've
got
to
have
a
very
thorough
investigation.
you've
got
two
questions
you
want
to
know.
one,
what
got
the
company
into
this
condition?
and
two,
what
if
anything
can
be
done
about
it
to
put
it
back
on
its
feet?
there's
been
no
such
study
made
here
and
indeed,
chapter
xi
doesn't
even
contemplate
such
a
study,
only
chapter
x
does.
in
addition,
we
think
there's
enough
here
to
at
least
raise
the
suggestion
that
there
may
well
be
possible
causes
of
action
against
the
old
management
and
we
don't
know,
but
certainly
again
warrants
further
investigation.
now,
there's
another
serious
problem
permitting
the
company
like
this
to
continue
to
be
reorganized
under
chapter
xi.
under
chapter
xi,
it's
the
old
management,
the
management
that
got
the
company
in
these
troubles
that
runs
the
business.
under
chapter
x,
however,
there's
ordinarily
a
new
management
and
this
court
recognized
in
the
general
stores
case
which
is
the
second
case
before
this
court
dealing
with
this
problem
will
be
used
in
chapter
x
against
chapter
xi
in
which,
in
that
case,
the
court
upheld
the
action
of
the
lower
courts
in
dismissing
the
chapter
xi
proceeding.
this
court
recognized
that
the
provision
of
new
management
may
well
be
essential
to
the
continued
and
prospects
of
the
enterprise.
as
the
court
stated,
readjustment
of
the
debts
may
be
a
minor
problem
compared
with
the
need
for
new
management.
without
a
new
management
today,
today's
readjustment
maybe
a
temporary
moratorium
before
major
collapse.
now
in
this
very
case
indeed,
the
district
court
recognized
the
possible
need
for
a
new
management.
in
page
145
of
the
record,
the
district
court
in
its
oral
opinion
stated
near
the
bottom
of
the
page.
“now,
there
may
be
in
this
situation
need
for
a
new
management
and
there's
certainly
some
question
in
my
mind
as
to
whether
or
not
the
management
that
is
presently
representing
it
would,
i
mean
operating
it,
would
continue
to
do
so
for
the
best
interest
of
the
investors.”
and
the
court
went
on
to
say,
“however,
that
has
not
been
clearly
established
yet.”
and
then
he
suggested
that
if
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
found
any
evidence
of
criminal
activity
on
the
part
of
the
people,
who
are
running
this
business,
they
should
report
it
to
the
justice
department.
well,
of
course,
the
reason
we
think
you
have
to
transfer
this
case
to
chapter
x
is
be
to
investigate
and
see
whether
there's
the
need
for
new
management.
to
say
that
there
may
be
need
for
new
management,
but
it
hasn't
been
conclusively
established
as
yet.
it
seems
to
me,
the
very
facts
that
the
district
court
recognized
this,
is
itself
the
strongest
argument
and
shows
the
need
for
the
full
inquiry
possible
under
chapter
x.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
first
of
all,
we
don't
know.
we
don't
know
what's
likely
to
happen.
we
don't
think
there's
any
basis
for
the
claim
of
the
judge
was
speaking
about.
he
referred
to
two
or
three
reorganizations
in
which
he
had
experience.
congress,
we
think
has
made
the
determination
that
in
this
kind
of
a
case
what
the
public
interest
calls
for
is
having
an
independent
trustee.
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
of
course
--
i
mean,
there
are
expenses
incurred
in
chapter
x,
that
you
wouldn't
have
in
chapter
xi.
and
there
were
expenses
i
think
for
the
very
reason
that
the
proceedings
are
more
comprehensive.
there
is
money
coming
into
this
company.
the
rentals
have
fallen
off
naturally
as
the
number
of
trailers
have
been
reduced,
but
there
is
money
coming
in.
but,
again,
i
suggest
mr.
justice,
that
what
the
court
seems
to
be
saying
here
basically,
is
that
it's
got
to
be
expensive.
he
thinks,
he
fears
it's
going
to
be
expensive.
there
may
be
difficulty
in
getting
money
and
therefore,
it's
appropriate
in
effect
to
disregard
all
of
these
things.
and
this
is
an
area
where
it
seems
to
us
that
basically,
the
determination
has
been
made
that
when
you
have
all
of
these
of
kinds
of
factors
is
that
the
public
policy
is
that
an
independent
trustee
should
have
a
look
at
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
may
--
we
don't
know.
we
don't
know
whether
they'll
get
--
let
me
suggest
this
mr.
justice.
under
this
plan,
those
who
participate
give
up
their
trailer
and
they
get
stock
in
this
new
company.
who
knows
what's
going
to
happen
to
this
new
company?
at
the
moment
they
have
something,
it
may
be
difficult
to
realize
on,
but
at
least
they
have
a
trailer.
once
this
plan
goes
through,
they
don't
have
a
trailer,
they've
got
them
stock
in
a
company
which
at
least
on
the
basis
of
the
history
of
this
enterprise
raises
serious
questions,
they
are
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
have
control,
but
the
old
management
presumably
will
continue
to
stay,
at
least
starts
in
this
saddle
and
again
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
roughly.
roughly,
no,
i'm
sorry.
they
have
about
80%.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
at
one
--
by
the
time
this
happens,
i
mean
in
other
words,
first
of
all,
the
old
management
of
course
does
have
control
and
will
have
control
of
the
proxy
machinery.
secondly,
assuming
that
the
--
well,
let
me
back
up
a
minute.
we're
dealing
here
basically
with
uninformed
investors
in
most
instances.
i
mean,
the
fellow
who
buys
a
trailer
for
$1000,
because
he's
been
promised
24%
or
36%
on
his
money
is
presumably
a
rather
unsophisticated
fellow.
and
it
seems
rather
unrealistic
to
suggest
there's
an
adequate
protection
to
these
people
to
say
that
they
have
voting
control
of
the
company.
now,
they
have
voting
control
of
the
company,
theoretically
they
have
it,
but
as
a
practical
matter,
it
seems
most
likely
unless
there's
some
real
organization
of
these
people
around
the
country
that
the
old
management
will
continue
to
operate.
and
indeed,
this
company
is
going
to
have
to
raise
some
money,
somehow,
i
suppose
the
company
two
weeks
after
the
plan
goes
through,
mortgages
all
of
these
trailers
to
who
receives
the
money.
now,
there's
one
other
important
and
a
very
important
thing
as
to
why
we
think
chapter
x
is
required
here.
this
is
to
make
sure
that
when
the
security
holders
are
called
upon
to
accept
or
reject
this
plan
that
they
received
full
and
adequate
information,
that
is
what
is
guaranteed
by
chapter
x.
chapter
x
provides
for
intervention
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
and
if
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
intervenes,
then
it
plays
a
very
important
role
both
in
helping
the
trustee
and
in
developing
information
for
submission
to
the
investors.
under
chapter
x,
the
investors
cannot
be
solicited
ordinarily,
to
consent
to
the
plan
unless
and
until
the
judge
has
approved
it,
unless
and
until,
if
it's
been
sent
to
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
for
an
advisory
opinion,
that
opinion
has
been
received
and
unless
and
until
the
stockholders
receive
from
the
proponents
of
the
plan,
a
full
package
of
information.
they've
got
to
get
the
plan,
they
have
to
get
the
judge's
opinion,
the
judge's
comments
on
the
plan,
the
report
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
two
answers
to
that
mr.
justice.
ordinarily,
the
trade
creditors
tend
to
be
more
sophisticated
i
think
than
the
public
investors.
secondly,
the
trade
creditors
frequently
do
organize
in
a
committee
with
some
organized
representation.
and
finally,
in
this
situation,
the
trade
creditor's
interest
is
very
frequently
quite
different
from
that
of
the
investors.
the
trade
creditors
primarily
are
concerned
with
the
short-term
condition
of
their
company.
they
want
to
get
their
money
and
the
trade
credit
frequently
will
be
willing
to
accept
a
good
deal
less
than
his
claim
in
the
hope
of
continuing
to
do
business
with
the
company.
the
public
investors,
while
they're
interested
in
getting
their
--
whatever
percentage
it
is.
they
are
also
equally
if
not
more
so
interested
in
making
sure
of
the
security
of
their
principle.
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
us
that
if
trade
creditors
are
willing
to
accept
these
things,
they
don't
need
the
same
measure
of
protection
that
the
public
investors.
that's
basically,
basically
what
the
whole
reorganization
reform
program
was
about
protecting
the
public
interest
of
the
people
who
put
their
money
into
these
businesses
as
an
investment.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
that's
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
certainly
is,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
we
do
make
that
suggestion.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
make
the
suggestion
that
they
are
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
do
make
that
argument
in
our
brief
that
these
people
are
in
economic
effect
of
secured
creditors.
and
therefore,
that
this
is
not
in
fact
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
would
not
be
a
perfect
--
they
would
not
be
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
don't
know
whether
they
might
--
they
might
not
be
--
their
liens
might
not
be
valid
as
against
other
creditors,
but
in
terms
of
whether
they're
secured
creditors
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
might
be,
i
just
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
don't
know.
we
might
--
on
the
other
hand,
it's
arguable
at
least
that
what
you
have
is
--
if
this
is
such
a
strange
beast,
that
this
is
really
not
just
an
adjustment
of
unsecured
debt.
it
seems
to
be
--
it's
really
basically
a
reorganization
of
the
company,
basically
here.
now,
in
contrast
to
these
procedures
of
chapter
xi
with
a
detailed
provision
of
information
to
the
creditors
and
to
the
investors,
chapter
xi
and
chapter
x
--
in
chapter
x
--
in
chapter
xi
it
is
just
the
opposite.
there's
no
objective
study
of
the
plan,
there's
no
requirements
of
any
information.
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
is
not
a
party.
the
debtor
who
formulates
the
plan
gives
just
about
as
much
information
as
he
wants
to
and
indeed,
consents
for
the
plan
may
be
solicited
from
creditors
even
before
the
plan
has
been
filed.
even
before
the
petition
for
arrangement
is
filed,
the
debtor
can
go
out
and
get
the
consents.
and
of
course,
as
the
court
pointed
in
realty,
when
the
plan
for
the
first
time
comes
before
the
judge
for
confirmation,
he's
faced
with
the
fact
that
the
majority
of
the
creditors
have
already
approved
it,
because
if
the
majority
of
the
creditors
haven't
approved
it,
it
wouldn't
be
presented
to
him
for
confirmation.
now
in
this
case
as
i've
indicated,
the
plan
seriously
deficient
in
the
information
it
gives
to
the
investor
creditors,
but
previously
mentioned,
he
doesn't
know
--
if
he
doesn't
go
into
the
plan,
what
happens
to
him?
all
that
there
is
in
the
proposed
plan
as
a
general
statement,
if
the
company
thinks
it's
a
good
thing
for
the
investor
creditors
and
it's
coupled
with
a
warning
that
if
the
plan
is
not
accepted,
the
trailer
owners
quote
the
record
at
page
7
to
8,
“may
find
themselves
unable
to
realize
any
value
for
their
trailers
or
any
income
from
their
operation.”
and
we
think
when
unsophisticated
investor
gets
this
kind
of
thing,
he
may
not
be
very
happy
with
it.
he
doesn't
know
enough
about
it,
but
it
looks
as
though
it's
something
better
than
what
he
has.
he
hopes
to
be
getting
24%
or
36%
a
year,
he
has
had
nothing
for
a
year.
the
pressure
is
overwhelming
on
him
to
accept
it.
whereas,
if
he
weren't
told
all
effects
that
they
have
been
objectively
explored,
he
might
conclude
he's
better
off
at
this
point
and
at
least
he
can
get
out
with
his
trailer
for
whatever
that
is
worth
and
to
go
ahead
with
this
new
venture.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
other
facet
of
our
argument,
which
is
the
argument
that
chapter
x
here
is
also
required,
because
this
plan
fails
to
give
the
public
creditors
the
fair
and
equitable
equivalent
of
what
they
have.
chapter
x
permits
the
confirmation
and
approval
of
a
plan
only
if
it
is
found
to
be
fair
and
equitable.
there's
no
such
requirement
in
chapter
xi.
there
had
been
such
requirement
in
1900
and
up
to
1952
when
it
was
deleted
and
i'll
come
in
a
moment
to
explain
why
we
don't
think
that
deletion
changes
the
results.
and
as
mr.
justice
stewart
had
pointed
out,
in
the
reorganization
field
the
words
“fair
and
equitable”
words
of
art,
which
have
a
definite
and
fixed
meaning,
they
connote
the
notion
that
you
have
to
payoff
the
senior
creditors
in
full,
giving
them
their
full
contract
claim
before
you
can
allow
anything
to
the
junior
interests.
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
--
if
i
may
mr.
justice,
i
would
say
that
the
two
lower
courts,
was
a
matter
or
is
a
matter
of
law
in
our
transfer,
i
mean
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
justice,
we
think
that
whenever
a
plan
under
chapter
xi
on
its
face
indicates
that
the
public
creditors
are
not
being
given
fair
and
equitable
treatment.
the
district
court
must
dismiss
the
chapter
xi
freely.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
no
such
requirement.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
was
once.
now,
we
think
that
the
basic
thing
is
this,
that
what
happened
was
in
the
realty
case,
where
the
court
had
said,
directed
that
a
transfer
was
required
in
a
case
--
this
is
prior
to
the
amendments.
the
court
had
said
in
the
reality
case
that
the
two
lower
courts
had
urged
in
refusing
new
transfer.
and
in
the
course
of
his
opinion,
justice
stone
recognized
that
there
might
be
situations
where
there
are
no
public
interests
that
chapter
xi
might
be
used
even
though
there
would
technically
be
of
violation
of
the
fair
and
equitable
stand.
now
in
any
case,
where
you
have
only
a
composition
with
trade
creditors,
where
you
have
the
businessmen
and
they're
going
to
give
them
$0.40
on
$1
or
$0.60
on
$1.
whenever
you
have
a
corporation
on
its
face
there's
a
technical
violation
of
the
fair
and
equitable
standard,
because
in
that
situation,
the
old
common
stock
is
continuing
to
participate
even
though
the
creditors
are
being
given
less
than
their
full
priority
of
claim
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
and
mr.
justice,
i
think
it
may
depend
where
you
begin
the
circle,
if
you
want
to
call
that.
i
think
we
begin
with
the
fact
that
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
creditors
cannot
be
denied
their
so-called
“full
priority”
in
a
reorganization,
and
indeed,
we
think
that
the
legislative
history
of
chapter
--
the
original
chapter
xi,
before
the
1952
amendments
indicated
that
the
basic
purpose
of
chapter
xi
was
to
permit
compositions
with
trade
creditors.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
chapter
xi
was
changed
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
it
is
--
yes.
if
it
is
properly
brought,
we
think
the
deletion
of
chapter
--
of
the
fair
and
equitable
standards
from
chapter
xi
was
intended
to
make
it
clear
that
a
plan
should
not
be
denied
confirmation,
when
it
was
involving
trade
creditors.
that
was
the
purpose
of
it.
but
we
think
that
it
was
not
intended
by
deleting
from
chapter
xi,
the
reference
to
fair
and
equitable
to
make
this
a
completely
irrelevant
consideration
in
deciding
whether
chapter
xi
had
been
properly
invoked
in
the
first
place.
this
is
our
basic
point
that
the
reason
--
the
reason
this
was
put
in.
the
reason
that
fair
and
equitable
standard
was
deleted
from
the
statute
was
because
insofar
as
trade
creditors
were
concerned,
there
was
no
need
for
that.
i
think
this
is
confirmed
by
a
couple
of
other
things.
first,
these
very
amendments
themselves
were
referred
to
by
the
house
committee
reporters
non-controversial.
and
secondly,
at
the
same
time
that
congress
deleted
the
fair
and
equitable
in
chapter
xi,
it
also
had
deleted
it
from
two
other
chapters,
chapter
xii
and
chapter
xiii.
and
those
are
both
provisions,
which
had
no
applicability
to
corporations.
one
dealt
with
real
estate
arrangement,
the
other
dealt
with
individual
wager
and
the
plans.
so
that
with
congress
it
seems
to
us
was
really
doing
was
saying,
there's
no
need
to
have
the
fair
and
equitable
standard
in
chapter
xi
because
in
deciding
whether
a
plan
is
to
be
confirmed,
once
it's
properly
in
chapter
xi,
since
what
is
involved
here
is
affecting
the
rights
of
sophisticated
business
creditors,
this
is
alright.
but
we
think
that
it
does
not
follow
from
that,
that
because
chapter
xi
no
longer
requires
fair
and
equitable
that
therefore
when
the
question
is
whether
it
was
properly
invoked
in
the
first
place.
you
cannot
look
to
see
what
the
effect
of
the
implication
--
what
the
effect
of
the
plan
is
on
creditors.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
two
in
a
sense
perhaps
interrelate,
so
--.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
here
we
think
it's
clear
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
hope
they
both
come
out
in
the
same
place.
here,
it
seems
to
apply
that
there
is
not
fair
and
equitable
treatment,
because
what
you
have
here,
this
company
has
admittedly
insolvent.
and
if
a
company
is
insolvent
it
seems
to
us
that
company
belongs
to
the
creditors
and
yet
on
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
would
--
if
i
may
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
should
be
dismissed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
may
i
--
may
i
restate
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
we're
saying
that
because
whenever
the
plan
proposes
to
give
them
less
than
fair
and
equitable
statement,
you
can't
deal
with
them
at
all.
we
recognize,
we
have
to
at
this
statute
then
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
we're
wrong
on
--
if
we're
wrong
on
that
when
we
come
back
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
mean
under
either
of
these
arguments?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
--
well,
if
we
can't
deal
with
investor
creditors
at
all.
we
then
say
at
the
second
proposition,
you
can't
deal
with
investor
creditors
if
you
don't
give
them
fair
and
equitable
treatment.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
that
would
mean
dismissing.
that
would
mean
dismissing.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
that's
not
--
that's
not
--
i
have
to
concede
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
the
statute
does
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
difficulty
i
have
with
that
mr.
justice
is
that
the
--
once
the
motion
to
dismiss
under
section
328
is
denied
as
far
as
the
commission's
interest
is
concerned,
it's
out
of
the
case.
this
is
a
matter
between
the
party
--
and
i'd
like
to
come
back
if
i
may,
you
quoted
from
the
provision
dealing
with
conformation.
that
of
course
assumes
the
case
is
properly
in
chapter
xi
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'd
like
to
refer
to
section
328
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
which
is
the
provision
of
page
3.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--of
our
brief
which
is
the
critical
provision
here,
which
says
that
the
judge
may
dismiss
it
if
it
finds
the
proceedings,
should
have
been
brought
under
chapter
x.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
we
--
if
we're
wrong
on
our
first
argument.
we
fall
back
to
the
fair
and
equitable
and
finally,
we
fall
back
on
the
proposition
that
even
though
transfer
may
not
be
mandatory
in
all
cases.
certainly,
in
the
facts
of
this
case
that
we
had
here
transfer
was
necessary.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
in
the
general
stores
case,
mr.
justice,
the
court
where
both
lower
courts
had
dismissed,
had
transferred
in
effect,
this
court
in
affirmance
said,
it
could
only
disturb
that
ruling,
if
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion.
now,
here
we
think,
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion.
we
think
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
there
was
no
--
not
the
same
kind
of
balancing
that
was
involved
in
the
general
stores
case.
the
general
stores
case,
the
plan
did
not
affect
the
interests
of
the
public
of
the
creditors,
public
creditors.
the
creditors
involved
in
the
case
were
not
members
of
the
public.
the
theory
on
which
the
district
court
had
dismissed
the
chapter
xi
proceedings,
so
that
they
were
publicly
held
securities,
stockholders,
and
it
--
in
order
to
protect
the
interests
of
these
people.
the
procedures
of
chapter
x
were
required
and
we
think
that
in
this
situation
where
all
the
material
you
have
here
is
--
shows
what
is
shown
here
that
--
in
any
event,
the
district
court
should
have
transferred
in
the
realty
case.
in
the
realty
case,
the
two
lower
courts
in
effect
had
upheld
the
denial
of
the
transfer
and
this
court,
it
concluded
that
in
all
the
circumstances,
a
more
comprehensive
reorganization
with
the
protections
of
chapter
x
was
required.
it
had
no
reluctance
to
correct
the
error
and
direct
that
there
shouldn't
have
been
a
transfer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
he
would've
--
let
me
assume
a
hypothetical
case
that
there
was
no
question
that
the
public
creditors
are
being
paid
off
$0.100
on
$1.
and
--
in
that
type
of
the
case,
it
seems
to
be
you'd
go
to
the
first
point
as
to
whether
nevertheless
there
was
any
need
to
protect
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
it
seems
to
me,
however,
is
that
most
unusual
case.
this
is
the
not
the
usual
situation
where
they
propose
in
the
court.
if
they
had
enough
cash
to
pay
them
off
$0.100
on
$1
as
frequent
as
they
did,
there
would
be
no
need
to
resort
to
these
provisions
at
all.
they
would
just
go
ahead
and
pay
them.
if
i
may
to
come
back
one
moment
to
this
fair
and
equitable
point,
i
would
like
to
refer
again
to
the
general
stores
opinion.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
could
be
pay
over
period
of
time.
it
does
not
have
to
be
paid
in
cash.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
not
necessarily,
because
whether
the
particular
plan
gives
them
fair
and
equitable
treatment,
it
is
often
a
very
complicated
question.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
have
some
difficulty
mr.
justice
in
accepting
that,
because
frequently,
resort
need
be
had
to
the
provisions
of
chapter
x
in
order
to
determine
that
very
question.
for
example,
suppose
there's
a
certain
interest
rate
and
they
propose
to
give
them
new
securities
with
a
different
interest
rate.
this
may
require
evaluation
of
the
business
to
see
what
the
risk
elements
are.
and
therefore,
i
can't
accept
the
hypothesis
that
despite
all
the
complexities,
you
could
tell
just
by
looking
at
it,
that
this
plan
would
meet
fair
and
equitable
standards.
if
the
case
were
–
as
i
say
that
they
were
just
paying
them
in
cash,
that
would
be
one
thing.
but
where,
you
have
a
complicated
question,
we
think
that
the
provisions
for
chapter
x
are
necessary.
indeed,
in
the
realty
case,
which
was
decided
when
you
had
the
fair
and
equitable
standard
in
both
x
and
xi,
the
argument
was
made
that
you
didn't
have
to
go
to
x,
because
you
could
determine
under
xi
whether
it
was
fair
and
equitable.
and
mr.
justice
stone
in
his
opinion
for
the
court
said,
no,
you
can't
do
that.
you
need
the
very
procedures
of
chapter
x
in
order
to
determine
it.
and
i
would
just
do
like
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
assume
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
would
be
possible.
it
seems
to
me
most
unlikely
that
the
management
which
represents
the
common
stock
interest
would
do
that.
and
of
course,
in
this
case,
they
didn't
do
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
could
disapprove
it.
the
court
could
conceivably
just
say
that
it's
not
going
to
approve
any
plan,
which
still
is,
but
the
management
doesn't
have
to
amend
the
plan.
the
management
can
go
into
bankruptcy
and
again,
you
may
have
also
referred
--
again,
in
this
situation
that
there
are
all
sorts
of
problems
as
possible
protection
of
the
interest
of
the
stockholders
in
addition
to
that.
if
the
plan
proposed,
imagine
i
find
it
frankly
very
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
management
coming
in
under
a
chapter
xi
plan
to
arrange
its
secured
debts
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
and
i
would
just
like
to
save
a
minute
or
two
for
rebuttal.
i
would
just
like
to
refer
to
what
the
court
said
in
general
stores
on
this
point,
which
was
decided
four
years
after
the
amendments
and
it
listed
as
a
typical
instance
with
chapter
x
four
for
the
more
adequate
remedies
in
chapter
xi
and
that
is
the
standard
for
deciding
which
chapter
to
be
used.
the
court
said,
“readjustment
of
all
or
a
part
of
the
debts
of
an
insolvent
company
without
sacrifice
by
the
stockholders
may
violate
the
fundamental
principle
of
a
fair
and
equitable
plan,
as
the
united
states
realty
case
emphasizes.”
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
i
just
have
three
rather
brief
points
i'd
like
to
make
on
rebuttal
but,
if
the
court
would
like,
the
government
will
be
happy
to
furnish
copies
of
the
opinion
in
that
case,
there
had
been
some
minor
corrections
to
the
slip
opinion
as
it
was
issued
and
we'd
be
happy
to
furnish
the
court
with
nine
copies
of
the
—
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
three
points
mr.
chief
justice.
first
on
the
question
of
intervention
to
which
reference
has
been
made,
we
have
on
page
7
of
our
reply
brief
discussed
this
problem.
the
commission
as
it
understands
its
authority
is
limited
only
to
intervening
to
make
the
motion.
we
do
not
believe
we
have
any
general
authority
to
intervene
in
this
very
case.
the
only
intervention
in
addition
to
our
motion
as
we
intervened
in
an
attempt
to
assert
that
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
securities
act
in
the
solicitation
of
the
consents
to
the
plan.
we
did
not
intervene
generally
in
opposition
to
the
plan.
now,
it
is
true
as
mr.
burke's
states
that
this
plan
is
voluntary
in
the
sense
that
the
investor
creditors
have
the
choice
whether
to
go
in
or
not.
but
of
course,
the
say
that
the
plan
is
voluntary
is
only
half
of
it,
because
the
question
is
what
are
they
told
when
they
are
asked
to
go
in
and
out?
and
there
is
also
the
suggestion
that
these
people
are
free
at
any
time
that
they
want
to
even
now
to
withdraw
their
trails
from
the
system.
but
at
page
96
of
the
record,
mr.
peters
testified
that
whenever
a
trailer
owner
wanted
to
withdraw
his
trailer
from
the
system,
he
was
required
to
execute
a
release
of
his
past
claims.
so,
what
amounts
to
is,
sure
you
can
have
the
trailer
back,
but
you
waive
your
claims
against
us
for
back
draft.
and
finally,
i'd
like
to
just
refer
to
the
argument
that
as
a
realistic
matter,
this
company
has
only
two
choices.
reorganization
or
rearrangement
of
its
debts
under
chapter
xi
or
bankruptcy,
and
then
the
claim
is
made
that,
if
you
don't
permit
this
company
to
use
chapter
xi,
you're
threatening
it
in
effect
forcing
it
bankruptcy.
again
in
our
reply
brief,
we
have
set
forth
some
statistics
which
indicate
that
in
fact
bankruptcy
is
no
more
frequent
in
a
case
at
least
statistically
where
a
case
has
been
transferred,
where
the
case
has
been
dismissed
under
chapter
xi
than
where
it's
retained
on
the
chapter
xi.
this
is
an
argument
that's
always
made
whenever
the
commission
says
that
chapter
x
should
be
used
--
the
argument
is,
is
always
made
or
you
can't
do
this,
you're
going
to
force
us
into
bankruptcy.
well,
our
answer
i
think
is
basically
this,
if
this
company
is
such
a
sick
company
that
it
cannot
be
reorganized
under
chapter
x,
then
it
seems
to
us
there
is
a
serious
question
whether
in
all
the
circumstances
it
should
be
even
rearranged
under
chapter
xi,
because
what
we're
dealing
here
with
the
interest
of
public
investors
and
when
public
investors
are
asked
to
choose
between
holding
on
to
their
trailer
or
getting
it
back
if
they
can
or
giving
it
up
in
exchange
in
stock
in
the
company.
if
a
company
is
so
sick
that
it
can't
be
reorganized
under
x
--
it's
by
no
means
clear
that
the
public
investors
in
this
company
are
better
off,
under
this
proposed
arrangement
than
they
would
be
if
the
company
ultimately
will
liquidate.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is
another
consideration
involved
here,
just
the
interest
of
the
company
--
it's
the
interest
of
the
public
investors,
and
we
think
the
interest
of
the
public
investors
in
this
case
would
be
better
served
in
any
circumstances
by
dismissal
of
this
proceeding
rather
than
by
committing
to
go
forward.
thank
you.
