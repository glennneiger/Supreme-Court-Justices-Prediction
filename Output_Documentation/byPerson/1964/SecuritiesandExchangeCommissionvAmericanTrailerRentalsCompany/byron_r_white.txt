justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you're
embedding
that
category
of
the
public
--
the
investor
creditor
or
is
that
pretty
well
grounded
in
the
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
is
embedded,
you
are
distinguishing
between
one
creditor
and
another
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
chapter
xi
should
never
be
used
to
conflict
an
arrangement
with
the
investor
creditor?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
anytime
where
they
combine
-–
they
sell
packages
with
stock
plus
a
loan
when
you
buy
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
not
the
only
reason
i
suppose
for
saying
that
chapter
xi
shouldn't
be
used
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
friedman,
is
there
discretion
in
the
chapter
xi
court
to
appoint
a
trustee?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
the
power
of
the
judge
was
to
--
when
a
petition
is
filed
under
--
a
voluntary
petition
is
filed
that
the
power
of
the
judge
is
the
same
as
though
there
had
been
a
petition
of
bankruptcy
and
the
company
had
been
adjudicated.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
means
he
can
appoint
either
a
receiver
or
a
trustee?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
chapter
xi
specifically
says,
either
a
receiver
or
a
trustee
can
operate
the
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
what
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
i
want
to
know,
if
it's
unclear
then
you
can't
say
that
the
court
has
no
discretion
not
to
appoint
somebody
else
to
operate
the
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
that's
another
point.
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
control,
overwhelming
control
of
the
investor
creditors?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
stockholders
have
plenty
of
opportunity.
i
mean,
they
can
oust
the
old
management
as
they
have,
what
do
they
have,
90%
of
the
stock?
justice
byron
r.
white
80%.
they
don't
have
to
anything
at
80%
to
do,
which
is
quite
a
bit.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
these
permits
apply
to
trade
creditors
as
well
as
the
stockholders
as
to
investor
creditors.
i
mean,
these
last
few
--
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
true
of
chapter
xi,
generally,
when
you're
dealing
with
a
large
unorganized
group
of
trade
creditors.
there
might
be
hundreds
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
friedman,
it
seems
that
the
chapter
xi
says
that
--
it
says
that
the
--
you
can
adjust
the
claims
of
any
creditor.
all
creditors
generally
or
any
class
of
it
gives
the
court
power
to
classify
creditors
and
treat
them
differently.
and
it
says,
the
claims
of
all
unsecured
creditors
shall
be
discharged
except
as
provided
for
in
the
plan.
now,
it
seems
to
me,
but
it
is
clear
that
you
don't
deal
with
secured
creditors
in
chapter
xi.
now,
congress
left
out
the
secured
creditors
in
chapter
xi,
but
it
didn't
leave
out
these
investor
creditors
that
you're
talking
about.
now,
how
--
it
seems
to
me
that
you
would
be
a
lot,
get
a
lot
closer
to
your
mark.
you
argued
these
people
were
secured
creditors.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
just
investor
creditors
generally.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
a
whole
series
of
leases
which
in
effect
perhaps
these
people
have
made
a
sale
of
the
company
with
a
million
on
the
trailers?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
just
wouldn't
have
perfected
your
lien,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
couldn't
speak
under
the
secured
creditor
--
in
a
secured
creditor
category,
because
you
wouldn't
have
satisfied
the
state
laws
on
recording
and
things
like
that,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
against
a
trustee
or
against
the
--
in
a
bankruptcy
court.
i
mean
in
a
chapter
x
case,
these
fellows
would
not
be
treated
as
secured
creditors,
if
for
no
other
reason
that
they
were
--
were
not
--
the
--
their
liens
weren't
valid
against
the
trustee,
because
they
haven't
filed
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
have
to
go
this
investor
creditor
route?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
766
says
the
court
shall
confirm
an
arrangement
if
it
is
for
the
best
interests
of
the
creditors
and
is
feasible.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
you're
saying
that,
that
provision
should
be
read
as
saying
that
--
what,
that
no
arrangement
shall
deal
with
public
investors
within
investor
creditors
other
than
a
fair
and
equitable
manner?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
saying
if
they
attempt
to
--
because
i
would
assume
that
your
argument
isn't
necessarily
that
it
should
be
transferred.
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
but
that
as
--
but
that
arrangement
just
won't
be
confirmed
unless
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
unless,
the
investor
creditors
are
treated
fairly
and
equitably
by
the
arrangement.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
could
understand
why
you're
--
on
your
first
argument,
why
you'd
say
transfer,
but
here,
if
you
are
–
this
assumes
--
this
argument
assumes
that
you
can
deal
with
investor
creditors
in
some
manner.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
you're
wrong
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you're
wrong
on
the
proposition,
you
can't
deal
with
the
investor
creditors
at
all?
what
if
you're
wrong
on
that?
then
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
on
your
first
argument,
if
you're
wrong
on
your
first
argument,
i
assume
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
but
that
doesn't
mean
transferring
in
the
sense
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
would
this
mean
saying
that
you're
going
to
have
a
plan
to
deal
with
these
fellows,
they
should
receive
fair
and
equitable
treatment
under
the
arrangement.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
thought
it
sounds
like
you
are
--
it
says,
it
is
for
the
best
interest
of
creditors.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
is,
then
you
should
confirm
it.
and
i
would
think
you're
saying
those
words
you've
interpreted
in
the
case
of
investor
creditors
is
meaning
fair
and
equitable?
justice
byron
r.
white
go
through
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand,
but
what
if
you're
wrong
on
your
first
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
was
started
out
at
the
chapter
x
case
that
--
and
they
put
the
plan
and
found
these
trailer
owners
that
two-thirds
have
been
voted
to
the
plan.
they
were
classified
separately
as
two-thirds
have
voted
to
the
plan.
that
the
one-third
who
voted
against
it,
the
nevertheless
bound
into
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
within
--
how
about
just
lessors?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
lessors
are
personal
property
under
chapter
x
and
chapter
x
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
mr.
burke,
if
these
trailer
leases
so-called
are
in
fact
a
secured
debt,
then
chapter
xi
is
not
available.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
chapter
x,
they
may
have
some
trouble
if
that
is
in
itself
a
secured
debt,
wouldn't
they?
even
if
the
referee
were
receptive
to
the
proposition
that
this
was
-–
the
form
where
he
doesn't
make
much
difference.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
protecting
him
and
this
protected
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
that
citation?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
name?
justice
byron

white
what's
the
other
case?
justice
byron

what
do
you
have
besides
the
fifth
circuit
case,
there's
another
case
