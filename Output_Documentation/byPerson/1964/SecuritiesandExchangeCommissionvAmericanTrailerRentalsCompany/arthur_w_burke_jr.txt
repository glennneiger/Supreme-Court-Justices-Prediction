mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
the
counsel
has
indicated
that
this
involves
a
rather
complicated
fact
situation
and
that's
not
basically
true.
in
december
of
1960,
the
following
facts
were
existing,
this
company
had
approximately
5,600
trailers
leased
from
various
trailer
owners
around
the
rocky
mountain
states
that
was
unable
to
meet
the
obligations
due
on
these
trailers,
because
they
were
under
a
firm
contract
amount
payable
at
the
rate
of
--
in
most
cases,
2%
a
month.
it
had
certain
general
creditors
of
rather
insignificant
amount
and
it
had
creditors
who
are
also
members
of
management.
being
unable
to
meet
the
obligations
created
by
the
leases
on
these
trailers,
it
had
no
alternative
but
to
seek
relief
under
some
section
of
the
bankruptcy
act
or
some
type
of
proceedings
such
as
that,
selected
chapter
xi.
now
as
indicated
previously,
there
are
two
methods
by
which
financially
distressed
corporations
may
obtain
relief
from
their
untenable
debts.
these
two
methods
are
generally
known
and
referred
to
here
as
chapter
x
and
chapter
xi.
chapter
x
may
also,
of
course,
deal
with
secured
debt
creditors.
now,
the
two
provisions
although
quite
different
in
the
words
used
come
to
the
same
import,
when
you
analyze
what
you
may
or
may
not
do
under
a
chapter
x
or
xi
or
in
either
case.
chapter
xi
provides
that
“an
arrangement
shall
mean
any
plan
of
a
debtor
for
the
settlement,
satisfaction
or
extension
of
the
time
for
payment
of
his
unsecured
debts
upon
any
terms.”
chapter
x
on
the
other
hand,
provides
that
a
plan
of
reorganization
under
this
chapter,
shall
include
in
respect
to
creditors
generally
or
some
class
of
them,
secured
or
unsecured,
and
may
include
in
respect
to
stockholders
generally,
or
some
class
for
them,
provisions
altering
or
modifying
their
rights
to
the
issuance
of
new
securities
of
any
character
or
otherwise.
now,
here
we
are
primarily
concerned
with
chapter
xi.
chapter
xi
has
had
a
rather
interesting
history.
prior
to
1942,
the
only
parties
to
a
chapter
xi
were
those
who
had
some
interest
in
the
chapter
xi;
that
would
be
the
creditors.
they
and
the
company
itself
would
necessarily
be
the
only
parties
in
interest.
at
that
time,
in
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
versus
united
states
realty,
an
improvement
case,
a
determination
was
made
that
this
was
an
equitable
proceeding
and
that
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
could
intervene
in
such
a
chapter
xi
proceeding.
thereafter,
chapter
xi
was
amended
to
permit
the
intervention
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
under
section
328
to
allege
that
the
matter
should
have
been
brought
as
a
chapter
x
proceeding.
now,
prior
to
1952
as
previously
indicated,
the
chapter
xi
contained
a
provision
that
it
must
be
fair
and
equitable,
and
of
course,
that
means
a
strict
priority
to
senior
creditors,
junior
creditors,
and
then
to
the
stockholders.
in
1952,
however,
congress
amended
this
section
and
removed
the
fair
and
equitable
provision
and
to
show
that
congressional
knowledge
of
the
meaning
of
its
amendment
that
congress
had
knowledge
of
the
meaning
of
its
amendment,
added
a
paragraph
to
the
end
of
this
section
stating
that,
“confirmation
of
an
arrangement
shall
not
be
refused
solely
because
the
interest
of
a
debtor
or
if
the
debtor
is
a
corporation,
the
interests
of
its
stockholders
or
members
will
be
preserved
under
the
arrangement.”
so,
that
is
not
grounds
for
the
reservation
of
the
interest
of
stockholders,
is
not
grounds
for
a
refusal
of
confirmation.
now,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
has
indicated
that
this
is
a
non-controversial
amendment,
merely
clarifying
previous
law,
but
that
is
not
what
is
indicated
by
the
history
of
the
amendment
because
in
senate
report
1395
in
the
82
congress
at
which
this
amendment
was
passed,
the
second
session
in
1952.
so
sections
35,
43,
and
50
of
the
bill
make
similar
changes
in
section
366
of
the
act.
the
language
fair
and
equitable
was
derived
from
221
(2)
of
chapter
x
in
which
for
the
purposes
of
corporate
reorganization,
the
requirement
is
sound
and
necessary.
however,
the
fair
and
equitable
rule
cannot
be
applied
in
a
chapter
xi,
xii
or
xiii
proceeding
if
construed
as
interpreted
in
northern
pacific
railway
company
versus
boyd.
now,
that
was
a
case
in
which
it
was
determined
that
strict
priority
shall
be
accorded
to
senior
creditors.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
that
is
--
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
no.
i
do
not
believe
that
it
contains
a
fair
and
equitable
provision.
i
do
believe
that
for
the
best
interest
of
creditors,
it
can
be
interpreted
to
mean
generally
fair.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
yes,
preserve
its
equity.
i
think
in
our
case,
provision
has
been
made
for
management
to
get
out.
i
can't
conceive
that
--
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
that's
not
--
and
until
the
plan
is
complete.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
yes,
that's
correct.
then
they
go
on
to
paraphrase
where
i
said
previously,
--
you
cannot
apply
the
fair
and
equitable
provision
to
chapter
xi,
xii
or
xiii,
if
construed
as
interpreted
in
northern
pacific
and
other
cases
without
impairing
if
not
entirely
making
value
as
the
relief
provided
by
these
chapters.
if
so
applied,
no
individual
debtor
or
corporate
debtor
or
stockmanship
is
substantially
identical
with
management
under
chapter
xi
and
no
individual
debtor
under
chapter
xii
or
xiii
can
effectuate
an
arrangement
or
a
plan
by
scaling
of
debts.
the
fair
and
equitable
rule
was
never
applied
in
a
composition
proceeding
under
the
former
section
xii
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
which
has
been
replaced
by
chapter
xi,
nor
is
it
practical
or
realistic
to
apply
at
any
proceeding
under
chapter
xi,
xii
or
xiii.
the
amendment
removes
the
fair
and
equitable
provision
and
by
paragraph
added
to
each
of
the
amended
sections,
it
is
made
clear
that
it
shall
not
be
applied
there
under.
so
that
congress
knew
precisely
what
they
were
doing
when
they
removed
the
fair
and
equitable
provision
and
made
it
quite
clear
that
their
intention
--
they
made
their
intention
quite
clear.
now,
it's
interesting
to
note
in
chapter
xi
and
chapter
x
that
there
is
a
reference
back
and
forth,
one
chapter
to
the
other.
chapter
x
provides
that
you
must
make
as
a
jurisdictional
allegation
that
chapter
xi
cannot
provide
the
relief
needed.
now,
this
would
seem
to
indicate
a
degree
not
absolute,
but
a
degree
of
preference
for
chapter
xi.
if
chapter
xi
can
provide
the
relief
needed,
then
obviously,
chapter
xi
is
to
be
used,
because
you
must
allege
in
a
chapter
x,
that
chapter
xi
cannot
in
order
to
cannot
meet
the
needs,
in
order
to
stay
under
a
chapter
x.
chapter
xi
now
provides
that
it
may
be
dismissed
--
chapter
xi
may
be
dismissed
if
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
or
any
party
in
interest
shows
the
matter
should
have
been
brought
as
a
chapter
x.
and
i
think
this
court
has
previously
interpreted
what
is
meant
by
the
language
should
have
been
brought
as
a
chapter
x.
i
will
get
to
that
a
little
later.
but
at
any
rate,
the
reference
back
and
forth
between
these
two
sections
creates
a
situation
in
which
the
proponents
of
a
chapter
x
must
show
that
chapter
xi
cannot
provide
relief
and
creates
precedence
as
i
said.
and
the
provision
in
chapter
xi
which
provides
for
a
permissive
dismissal,
if
the
matter
should
have
been
brought
under
a
chapter
x
imposes
a
burden
on
the
parties
moving
to
dismiss.
in
this
case,
it
imposed
a
burden
upon
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
to
prove
that
there
is
a
reason
why
chapter
xi
is
not
available
and
to
prove
--
and
this
is
probably
more
important,
to
prove
that
chapter
x
is
available;
because
certainly,
if
chapter
x
is
not
available,
no
one
could
justifiably
say
that
it
should
have
been
brought
as
a
chapter
x.
and
then
it
has
an
additional
burden
and
this
burden
is
imposed
by,
i
believe
this
court
is
imposed
in
a
realty
case,
and
that
burden
is
that
they
must
also
prove
that
chapter
x
better
meets
the
needs
to
be
served
than
a
chapter
xi
does.
in
other
words,
there
are
those
two
affirmative
burdens.
now,
in
this
case,
as
it's
obvious
from
statement
to
counsel,
as
it's
obvious
from
the
brief,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
have
gone
to
great
limits
to
pick
apart
this
record
to
pick
a
part
of
this
company
to
attack
the
plan
as
proposed
under
the
chapter
xi,
but
has
offered
no
evidence
to
indicate
that
a
chapter
x
better
meets
the
needs
to
be
served
or
that
chapter
x
meets
the
needs
to
be
served
at
all.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
well,
of
course.
first
of
all,
the
simple
answer
and
that
is
if
there
are
--
if
you
intend
to
adjust
the
rights
of
secured
creditors,
chapter
x
is
available.
i
think
and
i
intend
to
cover
this
and
i'll
go
through
it
right
now.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
yes,
i
believe
--
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
the
only
chapter
x
provides
that
you
may
adjust
the
rights
of
secured
creditors.
in
fact,
i
believe
that
chapter
xi
specifically
refers
only
the
unsecured
creditors.
now,
that
it
may
necessitate
in
an
answer
your
question,
certain
factual
presumptions.
one,
we
have
a
situation
in
this
particular
case,
in
which
there
is
insufficient
money
to
pay
for
a
chapter
xi
proceeding
--
chapter
x
proceeding.
there
is
no
money
to
pay
a
receiver
or
a
trustee.
second,
the
only
asset
of
this
company,
the
primary
asset
of
this
company
except
for
some
insignificant
furniture
and
office
script
--
the
primary
asset
of
this
company
is
its
contractual
relations
with
a
series
of
station
operators
numbering
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
this
arrangement,
some
500
stations
across
the
united
states
and
unclear
across
maine
to
california
and
seattle
to
miami
beach.
these
contractual
arrangements
are
with
for
the
most
part,
filling
station
operators
without
being
intending
to
degrade
filling
station
operators,
they
are
not
the
most
astute
businessmen
and
i
think
that
clearly,
when
you
--
company
with
whom
they
are
dealing
gets
in
a
little
bit
of
trouble
and
starts
talking
about
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
even
though
it
may
be
a
rearrangement
proceeding
that
nevertheless,
they
begin
to
worry
and
they
begin
to
think
how
to
protect
themselves.
now,
i
could
give
examples
of
that.
they
are
not
in
the
record
and
in
the
record
before
the
court,
but
the
company
has
had
some
difficulty
with
station
operators
as
a
result
of
being
in
a
chapter
xi
even
though
you
can
handle
it
much
faster.
so
that,
there
is
a
necessity
for
speed
in
order
to
keep
these
contractual
arrangements
as
intact
as
may
be
done.
the
third
reason
and
this
i
think
is
absolutely
determinative
in
this
case
and
that
is
this.
these
leases
with
the
station
--
with
the
trailer
owners,
mr.
friedman
has
stipulated
with
me,
i'll
have
to
explain
just
briefly
--
when
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
ask
for
a
lease
to
be
introduced
--
so
that
they
could
introduce
it
into
evidence.
the
manager
of
the
company
ran
over
to
the
company
on
his
lunch
hour
and
brought
it
back
and
he
brought
back
a
non-typical
lease
and
said,
“here
is
a
typical
lease.”
and
at
any
rate,
the
lease
which
is
printed
in
the
replied
brief
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
is
not
the
leases
of
--
all
of
the
leases
are
not
of
this
nature.
that
lease
does
not
contain
any
provision
for
termination
upon
entry
of
a
receiving
order
or
bankruptcy
proceedings.
mr.
friedman
has
stipulated
with
me
that
i
may
state
to
the
court
that
some
of
the
leases
--
with
his
consent,
some
of
the
leases
do
contain
a
provision
for
termination
of
the
lease,
automatic
termination
upon
entry
of
a
receiving
order
or
a
bankruptcy.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
yes.
that
--
and
that
provision
i
believe
is
paragraph
11
on
the
same
--
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
x
of
the
--
say
on
the
second
page.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
all
right,
thank
you.
now,
i
will
go
further
and
this
without
--
and
mr.
friedman
stipulation
on
this
point
and
state
that
many
of
the
leases
contained
the
provision.
this
provision
was
inserted
in
1959
in
the
leases
and
all
of
the
leases
that
were
executed
in
the
year
--
in
the
last
three
quarters
of
1959
and,
at
least,
the
first
three
quarters
of
1960,
and
probably
all
of
1960
contained
this
provision
terminating
the
lease
upon
the
entry
of
the
receiving
order
or
a
bankruptcy
proceeding.
so,
we're
faced
with
the
situation
in
which
a
receiver
or
a
trustee
would
have
no
right
to
take
and
use
any
of
this
money.
i
think
it
might
even
be
considered
a
criminal
conversion
if
we
had.
he
has
no
right
to
possession
of
any
of
these
trailers
to
continued
operation
of
the
trailers.
in
other
words,
a
trustee
would
come
down
finally
to
a
situation
in
which
he
has
no
trailers
to
operate
and
certainly
no
income
from
his
non-operating
trailers.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
your
honor,
i
can't
disagree
completely
because
of
course
that
clause
has
never
been
interpreted.
i
would
from
my
own
practical
point
of
view
in
advising
the
trailer
owner
client,
i
would
advise
him
that
certainly
there
is
no
way
he
could
make
an
arrangement
and
until
such
time
as
a
receiver
or
a
trustees
made
an
offer
under
a
reorganization
plan,
because
prior
to
that
time
--
prior
to
the
time
that
he
has
made
a
contractual
arrangement
as
we
envisioned
under
the
arrangement,
then
he
would
have
no
right
to
possession
of
the
trailers,
i
don't
believe.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
all
right,
i've
--
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
i
disagree,
but
i
think
that
it
is
subject
to
interpretation
and
i
certainly
can't
say
absolutely
no.
he
could
make
no
such
arrangements.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
no.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
no,
i
don't
disagree
with
that.
i
disagree
with
his
right
to
possession
of
the
trailers
or
the
receipt
of
any
monies
or
his
ability
to
make
arrangements
with
some
--
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
now
the
second
--
the
last
point
on
that
particular
question
is
this
that
in
the
--
throughout
the
proceedings
in
this
arrangement,
the
company,
the
directors
have
provided
funds
for
the
continued
administration
of
the
company.
and
in
addition,
one
of
the
directors,
mr.
peters,
has
offered
full-time
management
and,
in
fact,
has
applied
full-time
management
without
compensation
in
order
to
keep
the
company
going
during
the
time
of
these
proceedings.
now,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
in
this
particular
case
to
finish
off
that
argument
has
just
grandly
without
any
proof
--
has
just
grandly
observed
that
chapter
xi
is
not
available
to
this
company.
this
is
by
virtue
of
rather
a
double
twist
in
logic.
i
think
one
of
the
justices
indicated
that
they
were
approaching
--
trying
to
approach
a
center
point
from
both
ends
and
--
that's
the
precise
analogy,
i
had
gone
earlier
that
they
have
said
that
--
because
you
removed
fair
and
equitable,
now
the
plan
can
no
longer
be
brought
under
chapter
xi,
it
must
be
brought
under
chapter
x,
where
fair
and
equitable
provision
applies.
but
they
have
never
attempted
in
this
particular
case
to
prove
the
availability
of
chapter
x.
now,
we
have
to
look
at
these
things
as
a
practical
matter,
when
we're
dealing
with
a
business
arrangement.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
if
chapter
xi
is
not
available
to
this
company,
there
is
only
one
route
that
is
available
and
that
is
the
ordinary
bankruptcy.
the
ordinary
bankruptcy
in
most
cases
might
not
be
so
bad.
insofar
as
one
of
the
justices
observed
frequently,
you
merely
prolonged
the
life
of
the
company
by
reorganization
or
rearrangement.
but
in
this
particular
case
as
indicated
previously,
we
have
trailers
scattered
across
the
united
states,
a
day-by-day
system
of
accounting
to
keep
track
of
these
trailers.
and
in
order
for
any
trailer
owner
to
know
where
his
trailers
are,
he
must
refer
to
the
records
of
the
company
and
these
records
are
daily,
in
case
of
certain
trailers
in
fast
moving
areas,
weekly
sometimes
and
sometimes
monthly
and
sometimes
annually
changed,
as
fast
as
the
trailer
has
moved
from
one
location
to
another,
these
records
change.
now
in
an
ordinary
bankruptcy,
a
trustee
would
have
no
inclination
and
i
doubt
that
he
would
do
it
and
he
would
have
no
inclination
to
keep
these
records
to
date.
he
has
no
interest
in
the
trailers.
the
only
thing
he
could
do
would
be
to
terminate
these
executory
contracts
or
leases
and
say,
the
records
of
the
company
are
available
to
you
to
determine
where
your
trailer
is
and
as
soon
as
you
determine
it,
go
get
it,
which
even
then
might
not
be
too
bad.
but
by
the
time
a
trailer
owner
makes
a
determination
as
to
the
fact
that
he
is
faced
with
a
problem,
consults
his
attorney
and
comes
in
to
court
and
attempts
to
find
out
what
to
do
--it's
suggested
that
that
trailer
will
not
move
and
there
will
be
no
further
record
from
that
time
on
as
to
where
the
trailer
has
gone.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
and
once
again,
not
in
this
portion
of
the
record.
the
court
below
and
i'm
trying
to
think
now,
whether
this
was
a
special
master
or
whether
it
was
the
district
court,
but
i
believe
it
was
the
special
master,
who
was
the
chief
referee
in
bankruptcy,
stated
that
chapter
x
is
not
available
to
this
company.
this
company
can
not
qualify
for
chapter
x.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
well,
by
reason
of
the
--
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
well,
for
one
thing,
the
termination
of
the
lease
is
automatically
appointed
upon
the
entry
of
a
receiving
order.
secondly
because,
in
the
chapter
x
you
have
to
show
where
you're
going
--
how
you
are
going
to
carry
out
your
plan.
where're
you
going
to
get
--
where
the
trustee
presumes
to
get
the
money
to
operate
a
chapter
x
and
it
is
an
expensive
proposition.
this
company
had
no
money
with
which
to
do
that.
its
income
was
decreasing
day-by-day
because
many
people
were
taking
the
trailers
out
of
the
system,
they
were
removing.
and
in
fact,
at
one
time
there
were
5,600
and
some
trailers
in
the
system.
there
are
now
approximately
2,000
trailers
in
the
system.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
i'm
trying
to
think
back
to
your
original
question.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
yes.
because
the
receiver
would
have
no
money
to
operate
it
on
there
for
one
thing,
because
as
a
practical
matter,
as
a
feasible
matter
under
a
chapter
x,
the
time
involved
would
completely
destroy
all
of
the
contractual
or
not
completely
destroyed
parties,
would
destroy
a
great
many
of
the
contractual
relationships
between
the
station
operators
and
the
company.
now,
this
has
happened
under
this
chapter
xi
because
of
the
protracted
time,
it
was
commenced
almost
two
years
ago
and
these
relationships
are
being
destroyed.
and
in
fact,
we
are
finding
almost,
i'd
say
once
a
week,
i
have
to
go
over
and
get
a
restraining
order,
restrain
someone
from
selling
trailers
that
is
a
man
who
had
operated
the
station,
rented
the
trailers
and
now
he
wants
the
storage
for
the
trailers
because
they
are
not
running
as
well
as
they
did.
the
company
has
dropped
out
someone
out
of
a
competitive
position.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
you
must
plan
a
receiver
if
the
debts
exceeds
$250,000,
a
trustee,
i'm
sorry
not
a
receiver
yet.
i've
interchanged
these,
i
mean
the
trustees.
in
bankruptcy,
i
believe,
the
legal
significance
is
the
receiver
is
ordinarily
a
temporary
arrangement
and
a
trustee
is
a
permanent.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
i
believe
that
the
appointment
of
a
trustee
is
in
effect
a
receiving
order.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
have
no
--
there
are
no
litigate
cases
that
i
know
of
on
that
particular
point
as
i
said
before.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
yes,
i
believe
he
does
under
chapter
x.
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
--
takes
possession.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
i
believe
the
only
time
that
a
debtor
could
remain
in
effect
in
possession
is,
if
the
receiver
or
the
trustee
were
to
employ
-–
in
effect
employ
the
management.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
right,
i
believe
that's
correct.
to
some
extent,
we
find
sometimes
under
chapter
x
of
the
managements
in
jail,
i
can't
reemploy
them,
but
yes,
it
is
done.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
yes.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
i
think
in
this
case
--
in
this
particular
case,
it
would
have
had
been
done
because
of
the
large
volume
of
records
which
is
necessary
to
keep
and
the
familiarity
you
had
to
have
with
the
overall
setup
of
the
records.
i
think
it
would
have
had
to
be
done
and
i
don't
believe
there
was
any
money
to
do
either
to
pay
a
trustee
or
to
pay
the
management.
that's
not
to
say
that
the
director
who's
now
working
for
nothing
would
have
worked
for
nothing
under
those
circumstances,
but
it's
less
likely,
because
as
it's
pointed
out,
the
directors
of
this
company
--
the
management
of
this
company
have
loaned
the
company
sufficient
money
to
where
they
would
have
a
6%
ownership
of
the
company
for
their
loans,
so
--
and
the
stockholders
would
receive
12%
for
their
stock,
that
is
for
their
system,
and
under
chapter
x,
it's
less
likely
that
that
would
happen.
so,
the
management
might
have
been
less
inclined
to
make
the
sacrifices
that
they
have
made
in
additional
money
some
time
under
chapter
x.
now,
there
is
one
thing
that
i
want
to
be
sure
and
cover
before
i
run
out
of
time
regardless
of
all
else
and
that
is
this.
that
this
plan
envisions
a
completely
voluntary
type
of
an
arrangement
with
these
trailer
owners.
the
trailer
owners
are
not
in
the
normal
sense
or
in
the
sense
even
outlined
by
counsel
at
the
beginning
of
his
argument.
they
are
not
public
investor
creditors
in
the
sense
that
he
outlined,
they
are
not
lenders
to
the
company.
they
own
trailers
and
the
debt
of
the
trailer
owners
is
the
unpaid
past
rental.
the
trailer
owners
may
remove
a
trailer,
they
may
remove
half
of
their
trailers,
they
may
remove
all
of
their
trailers.
no
vote
by
any
group
of
trailer
owners
that
is
to
say,
if
99%
of
the
trailer
owners
vote
affirmatively
in
favor
of
this
plan,
the
1%
may
still
remove
all
of
their
trailers
or
any
part
of
their
trailers
and
they
may
vote
affirmatively
insofar
as
a
portion
of
their
own
trailers
go,
so
that
there
is
no
involuntary
affecting
of
the
rights
of
creditors
as
you
would
have
with
a
bond
or
an
indenture
of
some
type
or
mortgage
certificates
that
sort
of
thing.
there
is
not
that,
because
no
one
can
bind
these
trailer
owners
in
their
individual
rights.
they
may
remove
their
trailers,
they
have.
many
of
them
removed
their
trailers
and
they
have
received
their
complete
cooperation
of
the
company
and
so
doing
it.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
if
the
court
were
to
take
the
concept
that
the
trailers
or
the
trailer
leases
in
effect
created
a
secured
debt.
yes,
i
believe
they
could.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
no.
as
lessors
--
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
i
don't
believe
they
could
be
bound.
i
think
that
they
could
remove
their
equipment
the
same
--
their
trailers
the
same
under
chapter
x
as
they
can
under
chapter
xi.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
that
would
be
correct.
if
we
were
--
if
the
american
trailer
rentals
company
were
attempting
to
effect
a
secured
debt
and
these
were
to
be
classified
as
a
secured
debt,
which
was
suggested
incidentally,
that
maybe
be
so
classified
at
one
time
and
that
was
rejected.
but
if
it
worked
certainly,
chapter
xi
is
not
available.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
if
they
are
secured
debts,
then
i'm
wasting
my
time
even
standing
here.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
i
doubt
that
a
majority
of
the
trailer
owners
would
desire
to
be
classified
as
a
secured
debt.
but
even
presuming
that
they
did
or
those
that
didn't
want
to
be
classified
as
secured
creditors,
i
think
that
they
would
have
difficulty.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
they've
never
recorded
any
instruments
indicating
a
lien
against
anything.
of
course,
they
have
the
titles
themselves.
the
titles
are
in
their
name
and
the
trailers
are
in
fact
licensed
in
their
name
with
various
state
license
plates.
i
think
they
are
clearly
owners.
i
think
they
would
have
a
very
difficult
time.
if
they
desired
to
do
so,
i
think
they
would
have
a
tough
time
proving
that
they
are
in
fact
secured
creditors.
now,
as
one
of
the
justices
pointed
out
earlier,
when
this
fair
and
equitable
provision
was
removed
from
chapter
xi,
it
would
have
been
very
simple
at
that
point,
if
they
had
intended
to
exclude
from
the
operation
of
chapter
xi
thereafter.
they
intended
to
exclude
from
the
operation
of
chapter
xi,
the
so-called
“public
investor
creditors”.
it
would
have
been
very
simple
to
say
at
some
place
in
the
section,
some
place
in
chapter
xi,
if
the
rights
of
public
investor
creditors
are
to
be
effective,
the
plan
must
be
fair
and
equitable,
or
to
say
that
if
the
rights
of
public
investor
creditors
are
to
be
affected
or
that
under
this
chapter,
the
rights
of
public
investor
creditors
may
not
be
affected.
in
other
words,
if
congress
had
intended
to
exclude
from
the
operation
of
chapter
xi,
public
investor
creditors,
certainly,
they
could
have
so
provided
very
easily
and
i
think
we're
bound
by
the
presumption
that
since
they
did
not
exclude,
then
they
did
not
intend
to
exclude.
now
--
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
of
course,
congress
codified
the
holdings
in
the
united
states
realty
case,
which
permitted
intervention.
i
believe
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
congress
greatly
restricted
the
operations
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
in
these
cases
by
allowing
intervention.
now
as
to
the
intention,
i
have
some
difficulty
myself
in
understanding
why
securities
and
exchange
commission
should
have
any
interest
in
this
and
why
congress
should
allow
them
to
have
any
interest
in
this.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
no.
not
in
public
investors
in
this
particular
case
and
i'll
tell
you
--
i'll
show
you
why.
presuming
for
the
moment
that
my
argument
is
correct
that
this
company
would
go
into
ordinary
bankruptcy,
that
the
records
would
quickly
become
outdated
and
these
trailers
would
be
lost.
then
the
people
who
stand
to
lose
the
most
are
the
trailer
owners.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
they
have
that
--
they
have
that
right
anyway
outside
of
these
proceedings.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
the
--
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
if
there
may
--
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
i
should
think
it
would
be.
i
should
think
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
would
have
introduced
such
evidences
they
have
on
that
particular
subject
rather
than
leave
it
to
innuendo
and
i
would
also
suggest
if
that
evidence
exists,
securities
and
exchange
commission
would
have
it,
because
they
investigated
this
company
once
rather
thoroughly.
as
it
was
pointed
out,
the
company
filed
a
registration
statement
which
never
became
effective.
so
that
information
should
be
available
to
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
if
it
is
available,
i
think
that
it
should
have
been
introduced
and
it
was
not.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
yes,
he's
not
gone
beyond
the
presentation
in
the
district
court.
mr.
arthur
w.
burke,
jr.
yes,
it
was.
now,
i
have
two
very
quick
points
that
i'd
like
to
cover
here.
one,
i
think
the
general
stores
case
very
clearly
sets
forth
what
the
rule
of
law
has
been
to
this
time
on
these
and
in
that
case,
the
court
rejected
the
theory
that
public-owned
debentures,
public
owned
mortgage
certificates,
public
owned
stock,
the
size
of
a
corporation
or
the
character
of
the
debtor
dictated
the
use
of
one
chapter
or
another.
now
that
case
clearly
established
that
fact.
it
went
then
into
the
question
of
what
wasn't
controlling
factor
and
established
that
the
controlling
factor
was
--
which
chapter
better
met
the
needs
to
be
served?
and
that
if
then
put
in
the
lap
of
the
district
court
as
a
matter
of
discretion.
now,
to
the
matter
of
discretion,
rather
quickly,
i
will
indicate
that
the
courts
below
requested
amendments,
in
effect,
requested
amendments
of
this
plan.
it
was
not
wholeheartedly
satisfied
but
the
plan
as
originally
proposed
--
it
requested
amendments
to
the
plan
and
these
amendments
were
put
into
effect.
prior
to
the
amendments
--
the
debts
--
the
management
creditors
where
they
received
one
share
of
stock
for
every
350
of
debt
after
they
would
have
received
one
share
of
stock
for
every
550
debt.
and
there
were
other
amendments
which
--
to
the
plan
which
i
haven't
time
to
cover
but,
be
assured
that
in
every
case
where
the
district
courts
suggested
an
amendment,
an
amendment
was
made.
i
think
that
district
court
exercised
sound
discretion
and
i
believe
that
that's
what
this
court
has
previously
told
the
district
court
to
do.
thank
you.
