justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible),
the
negligence
of
an
employee
or
the
typical
negligence
of
a
seaman
would
amount
to
un-seaworthiness?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
jones
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
think
of
negligence
separately.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
lindgren.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
statutory
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
may
be
true
as
regards
to
negligence,
what
about
unseaworthiness?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
had
the
problem,
that
there
was
no
recovery
for
negligence
by
a
seaman,
and
there
was
no
recovery
after
his
death
--
justice
byron
r.
white
obviously
therefore,
and
that's
what
they
address
themselves
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
at
that
time
un-seaworthiness
normally
did
not
include
simple
negligence
that
followed
service,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
that
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
what
the
osceola
held?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
how
could
congress
possibly
have
been
addressing
itself
to
the
unseaworthiness
recovery
when
they
were
dealing
with
negligence?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
--
and
they
dealt
solely
with
negligence,
act
of
negligence.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
couldn't
possibly
have
had
in
mind
what
the
question
was
about
--
an
issue
about
unseaworthiness
because
the
law
then
was
settled
that
unseaworthiness
didn't
include
negligence
and
there
was
no
survival
of
unseaworthiness
claim
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
your
employers
liability
act's
argument
isn't
much
good.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
only
reaches
the
negligence
side
of
it
and
the
argument
in
this
case
is
not
that
the
state
laws
reach
a
negligence
cause
of
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
argument
is
that
the
state
law
reaches
an
un-seaworthiness
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah
but
your
argument
--
that
isn't
your
argument.
your
argument
is
that
because
they
provided
a
remedy
of
negligence.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
intended
that
there
be
no
remedy
in
un-seaworthiness,
that's
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
other
side
isn't
arguing
that
congress
intended
to
provide
a
remedy
in
un-seaworthiness,
you're
arguing
that
congress
intended
to
exclude
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
you
probably
could
make
a
stronger
argument
if
you
said
that
wherever
negligence
and
un-seaworthiness
overlaps,
where
the
two
--
where
they
overlap
then
there
must
be
preemption.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
if
it's
dealing
with
un-seaworthiness.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
take
a
case
where
no
one
would
argue
that
the
unseaworthiness
could
--
the
unseaworthy
condition
constitutes
negligence
and
there
are
such
cases.
take
one
of
those
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
would
you
suggest
to
me
that
the
jones
act
precludes
applying
a
state
wrongful
death
statute
in
that
circumstance?
justice
byron
r.
white
solely
on
the
basis
of
lindgren.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
you
argue
that
congress
intended
to
exclude
it
in
those
circumstances?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
--
wanted
to
see
whether
or
not
your
argument
really
is
limited
to
an
overlap
--
to
the
overlap
which
is
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
allegations
would
make
this
up,
because
certainly
if
that
--
it
may
not
be
unseaworthiness
but
certainly
its
negligence.
do
you
think
it
may
be
a
claim
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
case
that
you
know
of
that
holds
a
simple
act
of
negligence
to
a
fellow
servant
of
unseaworthiness?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you
another
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
practical
argument
here
between
the
seaman
and
the
company?
is
there
going
to
be
multiple
recoveries
here,
if
the
petitioner
wins,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
really
mind
in
this
particular
case,
let's
go
and
talk
about
the
effect
on
the
law
--
justice
byron
r.
white
involved
here.
how
about
the
dollar
percent
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
really
care
whether
he
covered
--
they
covered
un-seaworthiness
or
negligence?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
get
the
impression
of
the
petitioner
here.
he
makes
an
argument
that
you
could
--
you
have
multiple
recoveries
from
--
that
if
somebody
can
--
if
one
beneficiary
might
recover
on
un-seaworthiness
and
another
one
for
negligence.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
pecuniary
fall
--
justice
byron
r.
white
by
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
does,
it
will
have
another
--
justice
byron
r.
white
will
have
some
additional
beneficiaries
--
justice
byron
r.
white
some
additional
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
does
have
a
factor
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
even
if
he
wins
on
point
here,
i
mean
in
going
about
proving
unseaworthiness,
he's
got
to
show
that
the
simple
negligence
would
come
to
serve
an
amount
to
unseaworthiness,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes
you
have
to,
that
i
suppose
you
people
bring
back
up
here.
