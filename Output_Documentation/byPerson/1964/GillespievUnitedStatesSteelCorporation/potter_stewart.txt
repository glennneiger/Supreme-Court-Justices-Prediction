there
wasn't
any
certificate
here
by
the
trial
judge
under
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
of
corsair
just
on
the
pleadings,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
you
do
have
all
the
30,
40,
50
years
of
decisions
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
and
all
that
the
jones
act
did
was
incorporate
that
act
by
reference
so
to
speak.
justice
potter
stewart
holding
that,
that
federal
act
is
exclusive
of
any
state
limitations
or
any
state
extensions
or
any
state
variations,
that
the
jones
act
is
an
exclusive
remedy
for
injured
or
killed
railroad
workers.
and
the
jones
act
simply
did
incorporate
it
as
an
act
of
congress,
incorporated
the
fela
by
reference,
by
short
hand
did
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
it
was,
but
that's
what
congress
did.
justice
potter
stewart
but
any
of
those
things
within
the
jones
act
doesn't
apply?
justice
potter
stewart
he
doesn't
have
his
jones
act
remedies,
if
he's
a
stevedore
or
a
third
party
or
a
passenger.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
but
some
of
the
cases
served
that
for
purposes
of
this
recovery,
we
will
treat
this
stevedore
or
this
man
as
a
seaman,
but
we
don't
treat
a
seaman
as
a
seaman
for
purpose
of
un-seaworthiness
if
he
happens
to
be
at
the
dock.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
think
nobody
--
i
think
i'm
right
am
i
not,
in
saying
that
it
has
yet
to
be
suggested
that
a
passenger
or
a
stevedore
or
any
other
third
party
has
a
jones
act
right
of
action.
justice
potter
stewart
and
clearly
this
person
is
a
seaman
and
he
has
a
jones
act
right
of
action
--
justice
potter
stewart
for
injury
or
for
wrongful
death.
justice
potter
stewart
what
case
is
that?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
all
right.
i'm
quite
interested
in
it
if
you
would
just
give
us
a
citation
with
it
again.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
koykka?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
justice
goldberg's
question
suggests
to
me
a
less
theoretical,
perhaps
less
theoretical
but
more
of
a
practical
question.
how
much
practical
importance
does
this
first
question
have
in
view
of
the
broad
reading
that
this
court
has
given
in
fela
cases
to
default
and
to
negligence
from
a
very
liberal
to
the
very
minimal
that
it's
--
as
it
has
required?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
see
why
this
is
negligence
in
this
area.
justice
potter
stewart
in
view
of
the
fela
decision.
justice
potter
stewart
you
really
do?
justice
potter
stewart
and
just
for
argument
sake
that
not
withstanding,
it
may
be
wrong,
lindgren
may
be
wrong,
may
be
wrong
in
deciding
that
if
it
blankets
this
situation
it's
a
problem
of
statutory
construction
and
that
we
ought
not
to
overrule
decisions
on
statutory
constructions,
but
leaves
the
revision
to
the
congress.
justice
potter
stewart
we
found
it,
so
don't
waste
time
on
it
