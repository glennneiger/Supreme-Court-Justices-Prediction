mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
go
first
to
the
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
harlan
as
to
whether
we
have
here
a
final
order.
we
objected
on
that
very
ground
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
was
no
final
order
for
a
review.
your
honor
is
in
error
in
thinking
that
both
sides
agreed
to
have
the
question
decided.
we
did
not
agree.
we
resisted,
but
mr.
day
made
a
persuasive
argument
and
convinced
the
court
of
appeals
that
he
had
a
final
order
and
so
the
court
of
appeals
said
since
--
mr.
day
urges
us
to
do
this
and
since
the
way
we're
going
to
decide
this
question
doesn't
hurt
our
side,
why,
we
will
deem
this
a
final
order
and
decide
that
there
was
no
admission
on
our
part.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no,
no
i
so
understood.
and
when
the
matter
came
to
this
court
on
petition
for
certiorari,
we
resisted
the
grant
of
the
writ
on
that
very
ground
and
urged
the
court
to
deny
it
because
there
wasn't
a
final
order.
now
the
court,
we
concluded,
ruled
against
us
on
that
point
and
i
am
not
one
for
wearing
out
my
welcome
with
the
court,
so
we
concluded
that
there
was
a
final
order
here,
or
at
least
that
the
court
had
satisfied
itself
on
the
point.
and
i
concluded
that
that
is
the
reason
that
it
is
not
argued
in
the
briefs,
and
i'm
looking
at
the
law
on
the
question,
i
thought
that
perhaps
mr.
day
has
a
point
in
that
the
judgment
below
does
cut
off
finally
the
rights
of
certain
beneficiaries.
and
then
i
looked
at
this
court's
cases
and
i
find
that
this
court
has
held
that
ordinarily,
it
will
not
review
as
for
example
where
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
has
been
granted
or
where
a
denial
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
will
ordinarily
not
review
those.
but
there's
a
series
of
cases
where
the
court
says
“well
if
an
important
question
of
law
is
involved,
it
will
review.”
among
those
cases
are
united
states
versus
general
motors,
323
u.s.
373,
particularly
at
377,
land
against
dollar
330
u.s.,
731
particularly
at
734
note
2.
the
larson
versus
the
democratic
financial
committee
in
3337
u.s.
682
at
685
particularly
note
--
at
note
3,
and
then
there
are
series
of
case
saying
that
where
a
separate
claim
of
right
has
been
determined
and
i
concluded
that
that
must
have
been
what
this
court
held
–
governed
these
other
beneficiaries.
that
was
so
held
in
cohen
against
beneficial
loan
337
u.s.
541
particularly
at
546.
roberts
against
the
district
court
339
u.s.
844,
swift
against
company
general,
i
think
it's
a
french
line,
339
u.s.
684,
stack
against
boyle
3421.
and
again,
some
cases
where
the
court
has
said
“if
the
case
question
is
important
and
needs
to
be
decided,
we'll
take
it”
and
that's
myers
against
bethlehem
303
u.s.
41
particularly
at
52,
and
hanover
star
against
metcalf
240
u.s.
403
and
forsyth
versus
hammond
166
u.s.
506.
so
we
concluded
we
had
lost
the
point
and
that
there
is
a
final
order
here.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
before
the
court
of
appeals
it
was
argued
and
briefed.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
or
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
we'll
be
very
happy
to
submit
the
authorities
on
that
point.
perhaps
it
really
ought
to
be
mr.
day's
version
and
we'll
express
our
views
in
opposition
on
that
point.
but
as
i
say,
we
concluded
that
there
was
a
final
order
and
that's
the
reason
the
point
is
not
briefed.
now,
i'd
like
to
touch
on
the
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
concerning
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
that
does
not
under
any
circumstances
apply
here
because
the
statute
expressly
says
it
does
not
apply
to
the
great
lakes.
and
in
any
case
of
course
does
not
apply
unless
the
event
occurs
more
than
a
marine
league
from
shore.
now
this
court
has
never
said
that
there
is
a
concurrent
remedy
under
the
jones
act
and
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
some
lower
courts
have
taken
that
view.
however,
the
conclusion
we
draw
from
that
is
not
that
congress
was
intending
to
provide
a
remedy
which
would
accommodate
as
here
claimed
a
state
remedy,
but
was
merely
providing
an
adjunct
to
the
existing
or
other
provided
federal
remedies.
the
cure
--
the
remedy
of
maintenance
and
cure
was
a
long
standing
admiralty
development
and
no
one,
i
suppose,
really
supposed
that
the
jones
act
cut
off
that
remedy.
so
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
that
is
true.
it
does
provide
an
alternate
remedy
if
it
ultimately
beheld
as
the
lower
courts
have
held
that
there
are
concurrent
remedies,
and
that,
so
far
as
this
court
is
concerned
is
still
an
open
question.
now
then
some
suggestion
was
made
by
mr.
day
to
the
effect
that
well
persons
other
than
those
who
were
truly
seaman
have
been
treated
as
seaman,
and
he
said
that
stevedores
have
sometimes
been
treated
as
seaman.
that
is
true,
but
not
since
the
longshoreman's
and
harbor
workers
act
was
enacted.
congress
provided
a
remedy
for
those
non-sea
going
individuals.
now
then,
going
to
the
central
question
in
this
case
which
of
course
is
whether
a
seaman
as
in
this
case,
who
meets
his
death
in
the
state
territorial
waters
may
assert
a
remedy
not
only
under
the
federal
statute
but
also
under
the
state
of
wrongful
death
act
as
mr.
day
has
suggested
that
point
has
been
decided
in
our
favor
and
we
think
the
court
ought
to
adhere
to
that
rule
for
several
reasons.
and
the
first
is
that
there
is
no
need
here
for
resort
to
a
state
wrongful
death
statute.
the
federal
statute
already
provides
a
remedy
in
the
event
of
the
death
of
a
seaman.
in
this
case,
there
is
pending
before
the
district
court
in
cleveland
the
claim
under
the
jones
act
for
the
death
of
the
seaman.
now
as
mr.
day
suggested,
this
court
has
in
some
cases
said
that
the
admiralty
law
may
apply
a
state
wrongful
death
statute,
but
those
cases
we
submit
had
no
relevance
here,
because
there,
this
court
was
not
confronted
with
a
federal
statute
as
it
is
here.
and
second,
in
those
cases
if
this
court
had
said
that
the
state
wrongful
death
statute
does
not
apply,
there
would
have
been
no
remedy
at
all
for
the
death.
so
we
say
that
the
--
there
is
no
reason.
the
reason
for
the
rule
in
those
other
cases
is
absent
here
and
there
is
no
reason
here
or
call
on
this
court
now
to
hold.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
that
is
true.
that
is
true
your
honor,
but
congress
here
has
spoken
by
statute
and
it
has
provided
a
remedy.
so
your
honors
are
not
confronted
with
a
case
where
if
you
deny
relief,
there
is
nothing
left
for
the
seaman
survivors.
here,
the
remedy
has
been
provided.
now
that's
the
first
reason
we
think
ought
to
induce
this
court
to
adhere
to
the
rule
as
it
stands.
the
second
reason,
we
would
urge
upon
this
court
is
simply
the
magnitude
of
the
job
of
revising
the
law.
as
mr.
day
made
clear
if
the
law
is
as
it
is
today
then
we
are
in
the
right
and
they
are
in
the
wrong,
and
they
say
that
if
that
law
continues
to
be
as
it
is
at
this
minute
then
an
affirmance
of
the
judgment
below
will
follow.
now
they
challenge
this
court's
cases
in
three
areas
of
the
law
which
mr.
day
enumerated.
beyond
that,
they
say,
that
once
the
law
is
made
tidy
and
ship
shape
in
accordance
with
their
views
on
those
three
points,
then
they
say
there
are
six
more
cases
which
will
need
to
be
explained
or
reconciled
by
this
court.
those
six
cases
include
five
that
were
decided
within
the
last
five
years,
but
that
isn't
the
end
of
the
problem
created
here.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
do
not
think
the
court
could
so
construe
the
jones
act
consistent
either
with
history,
with
this
court's
prior
cases
or
with
a
congressional
intent.
i
believe
that
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
there
are
only
certain
areas
in
which
there
is
so
to
speak
liability
without
fault.
that
is
to
say,
violation
of
the
safety
appliance
act
or
something
of
that
kind,
i
don't
believe
it's
a
universal
rule.
now
i
concede
of
course,
that
this
court
being
the
supreme
court
can
declare
that
under
the
jones
act
there
is
liability
without
fault,
but
i
do
not
believe
the
court
can
do
it
and
remain
faithful
and
consistent
either
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
to
this
court's
cases
or
to
history
on
this
point.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
that
is
to
say
how
important
is
the
distinction
as
to
whether
negligence
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
and
that
is
a
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
that
is
a
difficult
question
to
answer
your
honor.
i
would
hesitate
to
concede
and
i
hope
this
court
never
will
hold
that
there
is
no
difference.
there
has
been
some
intimation,
i
know
in
decisions
that
perhaps
there
is
no
difference.
but
after
all,
congress
did
put
in
the
requirement
of
negligence
in
the
statute
and
i
for
one
would
hate
to
see
this
court
read
that
out
of
the
statute
as
a
practical
matter,
i
would
much
prefer,
if
a
case
is
to
go
to
the
jury
to
argue
to
the
jury
that
now
you
are
required
under
the
law
before
you
may
find
against
us,
find
that
there
is
negligence
so
that
i
think
that
it
has
a
very
real
and
practical
importance
in
the
trial
of
cases.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes
i
do
your
honor.
now,
that
is
not
the
end
of
the
task
of
re-plowing
the
law
that
is
urged
on
this
court.
they
asked
in
their
central
question
here
that
the
jones
act
be
read
in
such
a
way
that
it
permits
state
provided
remedies
to
be
utilized.
now,
we're
dealing
here
actually
with
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
all
congress
did
in
the
jones
act
was
to
say
that
whatever
rights
are
given
to
railway
workers
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
those
same
rights
we
give
to
seamen.
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
court
is
to
say
that
this
statute
accommodates
state
provided
remedies
when
applied
to
seamen's
cases
then
the
work
of
this
court
for
50
years
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
where
in
case
after
case
this
court
has
ruled
to
the
contrary
is
certainly
cast
into
doubt
and
a
whole
new
host
of
problems
are
raised
not
merely
in
the
narrow
maritime
industry,
but
in
the
much
wider
field
occupied
by
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
so
we
say
that
it's
too
big
a
job
to
ask
this
court
to
undertake.
if
i
may
use
the
language
of
modern
america,
it's
congress
that
is
the
big
job
cleaner.
we
submit
that
their
arguments
for
reversal
of
the
cases
in
this
court
over
--
well
for
34
years
under
the
jones
act
and
for
more
than
50
years
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
ought
not
to
be
addressed
to
this
tribunal
but
ought
to
be
addressed
to
congress,
because
if
there
is
anything
wrong
with
this
statute,
congress
can
tailor
the
remedy
to
fit
the
ill.
this
court
cannot
do
so
without
raising
a
host
of
new
problems.
so
we
say
that
for
that
second
reason,
this
court
ought
to
adhere
to
the
rule
announced
in
lindgren
and
hold
as
did
the
courts
below
and
as
did
the
court
in
1934
in
lindgren
that
under
the
jones
act,
there
is
no
room
for
the
application
of
state
provided
remedies.
now
third,
we
draw
this
court's
attention
to
the
claims
of
stare
decisis.
now,
i
appreciate
that
that
isn't
the
conclusive
answer,
but
in
lining
up
the
scales
to
determine
where
the
weights
are
to
be
put
in
arriving
at
judgment
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
stare
decisis
is
a
factor
that
weighs
and
ought
to
weigh
heavily
in
determining
what
judgment
ought
to
be
entered.
now
i
go
to
my
third
--
to
my
fourth
point
that
even
if
lindgren
had
not
been
decided,
if
this
were
an
open
question
and
coming
to
the
court
now
for
the
first
time,
we
submit
that
this
court
should
now
announce
the
same
rule
as
was
announced
by
the
court
in
the
lindgren
case.
now
why?
well
i'm
assuming
now
that
if
we're
writing
on
a
clean
slate,
first
because
that
would
be
responsive
to
congressional
intent.
now
mr.
day
says
that
there
is
really
no
congressional
history
to
indicate
what
congress
did
intend
or
mean
by
this
statute.
well,
that
is
true
if
you
don't
look
far
enough
back.
if
you
look
only
at
the
jones
act
there
is
no
history,
but
bear
in
mind
the
statute
we
are
construing
here
is
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
enacted
in
1908.
when
that
legislation
came
to
the
floor
of
congress,
it
came
accompanied
by
committee
reports
that
said
that
if
this
legislation
is
enacted,
it
will
suppliant
state
provided
remedies.
and
when
this
court
in
the
winfield
case
examined
that
statutory
history
because
shortly
after
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
was
enacted,
question
arose
there
as
arises
in
this
case,
is
there
room
for
the
operation
of
state
provided
remedies.
this
court
examined
that
history
in
the
winfield
case
and
said
that
the
reports
of
the
congressional
committees
having
the
billing
charge,
disclosed
without
any
uncertainty
that
it
was
intended
to
be
very
comprehensive
and
to
withdraw
all
injuries
from
the
operation
of
state
statutes.
so
we
say
therefore
that
this
court
if
it
is
an
open
question,
since
an
important
problem
always
is
in
statutory
construction
to
determine
what
was
the
intent
of
the
legislative
body,
we
say
that
congress
when
12
years
later
it
then
said
merely
in
the
jones
act
whatever
rights
are
given
to
railway
workers
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
those
same
rights
shall
be
carried
over
to
seamen's
cases.
surely,
if
congress
intended
to
give
that
statute
as
applied
to
seamen's
cases,
a
different
meaning
and
it
said
it
shall
have
in
railway
cases,
congress
surely
must
have
said
so,
but
it
didn't.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
of
which?
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
of
lindgren.
lindgren
was
based
largely
on
the
construction
that
had
been
given
to
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
in
the
cases
that
preceded
lindgren.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
as
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation,
and
that
was
a
court
that
included
mr.
justice
sanford,
mr.
justice
holmes,
mr.
justice
van
devanter,
mr.
justice
mcreynolds,
mr.
justice
brandeis,
mr.
justice
sutherland,
mr.
justice
stone,
mr.
justice
butler,
some
of
the
great
names
of
this
court.
and
they
unanimously
reached
the
conclusion,
that
it
excluded
the
operation
of
state
statutes.
so
we
say
for
that
reason
if
the
question
is
an
open
one,
we
ought
to
adhere
to
--
we
ought
now
to
declare
the
same
rule
as
was
declared
in
lindgren.
now
secondly,
we
appeal
to
the
--
perhaps
the
first
rule
of
statutory
construction.
it
is
a
familiar
rule
that
if
a
legislative
body,
take
a
state,
adopts
a
statute
which
has
been
enacted
in
a
sister
state,
that
later
state
in
picking
up
that
earlier
statute
adopted
by
a
sister
state
is
deemed
to
pick
up
that
statute
encrusted
with
the
decisions
of
the
courts
in
the
state
which
originally
enacted
that
statute,
unless
the
second
state
says
“we
intend
now
to
give
this
a
different
construction.”
now
so
here,
after
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
was
enacted
in
1908,
a
series
of
cases
came
to
this
court
really
presenting
the
same
question
that
is
here
as
to
whether
there
is
room
for
state
provided
remedies.
and
this
court
in
at
least
six
cases
before
the
jones
act
was
enacted
held
that
this
same
statute
when
applied
to
railway
cases
excluded
state
provided
remedies.
now
we
submit
that
it
is
a
fair
conclusion
that
when
congress
then
says
“we
want
that
statute,
that
same
statute
applied
to
seaman's
cases”
it
must
necessarily
have
meant
that
statute
construed
as
it
had
been
construed
by
this
court
in
a
half
dozen
cases
and
so
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
congress
expressly
said
in
the
statute
that
liability
may
be
imposed
for
negligence.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
precisely
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well
perhaps
so,
that
has
been
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well
that
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well
the
osceola
held,
so
held
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well
--
but
it
was
settled
law
at
that
time
that
the
claim
for
unseaworthiness
would
not
survive
death.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
now
when
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
precisely,
and
if
congress
had
intended
to
say
that
in
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
perhaps
we're
talking
at
cross
purposes.
perhaps
what
you
are
saying
mr.
justice
white
is
that
congress
really
had
no
intent
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well
i
don't
like
to
hear
your
honor
say
that
because
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
a
powerful
one
because
we
are
dealing
with
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
but
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
but
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
if
congress
had
intended
that
when
it
enacted
the
jones
act,
had
intended
to
provide
a
remedy
after
death
not
only
for
negligence
but
also
for
seaworthiness
–
un-seaworthiness.
it
would
have
said
so.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
it
is.
that
is
part
of
my
argument.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes,
your
honor.
well,
exclude
in
this
sense
that
they
said
“we
provide
a
remedy
for
negligence”
and
it
is
my
position
that
when
congress
says
negligence
it
means
negligence
and
nothing
else.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
i
don't
see
why
it
needs
to
be
so
confined.
here,
congress
is
dealing
with
this
very
subject
matter
and
if
it
says
there
shall
be
a
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well
it's
dealing
with
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes
your
honor
i
would
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
on
the
basis
of
lindgren
and
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes
that
is
my
argument
and
let
me
try
this
then
mr.
justice
white.
it
is
the
appeal
to
logic.
now,
our
friends
on
the
other
side
here
mr.
day
argues
that
there
is
something
illogical
in
a
rule
of
law
which
permits
a
seaman
to
make
a
claim
for
unseaworthiness
so
long
as
he
lives,
but
then
after
his
death,
he
no
longer
has
that
claim.
now,
that
we
submit
is
spurious
logic.
we
say
that
so
long
as
this
seaman
lived
his
rights
were
governed
in
every
respect
by
federal
law.
now
we
say
it
would
be
highly
illogical
to
say
that
following
death,
state
law
should
takeover
either
in
whole
or
supplementary
part.
we
say
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
it
was
the
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
that
is
true
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
that
is
true
your
honor,
but
there,
there
was
no
remedy
otherwise
provided
because
the
law
was
settled
that
any
claim
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
i
think
it
does
your
honor.
i
think
that
we
have
a
problem
here
where
the
seaman's
rights
prior
to
death
were
governed
by
federal
law
and
it
seems
to
me,
it
must
be
the
same
law
that
governs
after
death.
and
that
therefore,
there
is
no
room
for
a
state
provided
remedy.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well
i
would
hesitate
to
say
that
because
i
think
there's
perhaps
some
question
here
whether
they
can
develop
a
claim
actually
of
unseaworthiness,
because
all
that
happened
was
that
this
man
was
returning
to
his
vessel
moored
at
the
dock.
he
said
he
reached
for
the
ladder
and
slipped
on
the
wet
floor
and
dock
and
fell
into
the
black
river
and
drowned.
now
maybe
they
can
develop
a
case
of
unseaworthiness
there,
i
am
not
sure,
but
--
so
it
may
not
be
an
overlap
case.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
oh,
yes
they
alleged
negligence,
yes,
yes
your
honor.
they
alleged
negligence
without
question.
and
we
say
that
is
not
open
to
them
accepting
under
the
jones
act.
now
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no
i
do
not
know
of
a
case.
there
may
be
but
i
do
not
recall
one
at
the
moment.
now
we
would
say
further
that
even
if
lindgren
had
been
erroneously
decided
in
1930,
this
court
ought
now
to
adhere
to
that
rule
even
so
and
that
is
because
it
has
been
law
for
34
years.
there
is
a
sound
public
policy
and
an
interest
in
the
continuance
of
a
rule
of
law
once
declared
because
people
can
and
do
adjust
their
affairs
to
a
rule
of
law
once
declared.
second
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well
that
was
a
question
that
was
debated
before
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
it
was
decided
by
lindgren
and
mr.
day
finally
in
his
brief
decides
that,
i'm
not
sure
he
says
he'll
give
up
the
point,
but
he
says
that
he
knows
that
he
understands
when
the
court
has
said
it's
against
him.
so
in
my
reading
it
is
not
dictum
in
lindgren
your
honor,
and
certainly
has
not
been
regarded
as
dictum
in
lindgren.
now
let
me
say
further
that
even
if
it
were
an
erroneous
rule,
this
court
ought
to
adhere
to
it
because
after
all
congress
sits,
what
they
are
asking
this
court
to
do
really
is
to
legislate
and
over
rather
a
substantial
area.
now
they
argue
in
their
brief
that
congress
has
been
alive
to
seaman's
cases
and
has
modified
the
law
when
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
precisely,
where
congress
is
free
to
act,
and
as
mr.
day
has
argued
in
the
brief
is
alive
to
seamen's
needs
if
the
rule
does
not
respond
to
the
needs
of
the
times,
congress
can
change
it
without
raising
the
collateral
problems
that
would
be
raised
in
this
court.
now
there,
in
addition
to
that,
they
asked
this
court
to
overrule
the
settled
law
concerning
those
who
are
beneficiaries
under
the
statute.
and
mr.
day
said
that
it's
rather
a
hard
rule
he
has
to
hold
there
and
of
course
his
first
difficulty
is
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
statute,
as
the
court
will
perhaps
remember,
contemplates
beneficiaries
in
three
categories,
first,
the
spouse
and
children
then
the
parents,
then
the
next
of
kin.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well
i
think
he
would
like
to
get
to
it.
i
think
he
would
like
to
enlarge
the
beneficiary.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
oh,
well
if
he
recovers
on
the
first
point,
no
he
does
not,
because
then
perhaps
the
state
wrongful
death
statute
if
it
applies
and
is
carried
over
bodily
then
it
would
cover
that
point.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
i
don't
think
so.
i
do
think
that
it
raises
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes,
yes.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
no
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
oh,
well
in
dollars,
if
the
beneficiaries
remain
the
same,
it
may
be
that
in
dollars
it
would
make
any
difference,
but
as
i
say
i
shrink
from
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
i
didn't
so
understand
the
argument.
i
did
understand
the
argument
to
be
that
if
he
prevails
then
he
will
be
entitled
to
claim
not
only
for
the
pecuniary
injury
to
the
mother
who
was
a
sole
survivor,
there
being
no
wife
or
children.
but
that
he
would
then
also
be
able
to
recover
for
the
brother
and
three
sisters
at
least
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes
to
them.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
to
them.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
in
that
respect,
yes.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes,
yes.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
yes,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
it
does
and
i
was
going
to
add
that
if
the
state
wrongful
death
statute
is
read
into
the
jones
act
then
what's
to
stop
other
statutes
from
being
read
into
the
jones
act.
say
a
state
workman's
compensation
law
or
perhaps
other
statutes.
some
statutes
have
enacted
statutes
of
liability
without
thought
and
so
on.
in
other
words,
i
don't
see
where
the
stopping
point
is
once
we
say
that
the
jones
act
doesn't
mean
what
it
says
and
what
this
--
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well
theoretically,
it
would
be
because
un-seaworthiness
i
gather
is
a
warranty.
it's
a
form
of
liability
without
fault,
whereas
if
it's
negligence
he
has
to
prove
negligence.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well
if
he's
going
to
prevail
on
unseaworthiness,
yes.
mr.
thomas
v.
koykka
well,
we
would
perhaps
try
to.
so
we
ask
for
an
affirmance
of
the
judgment
below.
