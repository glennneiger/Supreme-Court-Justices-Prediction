mr.
jack
g.
day
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may,
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
and
i
should
say
by
way
of
preface
at
the
outset
that
i
think
that
we
are
entitled
to
have
the
facts
alleged
in
our
petition
and
set
out
in
the
record
--
our
complaint
rather,
and
set
out
in
the
record
taken
as
true.
although
we
get
here
by
way
of
a
sustained
motion
to
strike.
the
facts
in
the
case
were,
very
briefly,
that
the
administrator's
decedent
was
helping
in
the
shifting
of
a
boat
belonging
to
the
respondent
at
lorain,
ohio.
it
was
a
bad
day,
the
wind
was
high,
raining,
it
was
wet
war
on
the
dock,
and
wet
war
as
a
consistency
about
like
grease
and
there
was
an
odd
shape
to
the
dock
which
made
it
difficult
to
completely
arrange
a
transport
of
the
distance
between
the
dock
and
the
ship
by
the
type
of
ladder
which
was
extended
to
the
decedent
when
he
attempted
to
board
the
boat
and
was
thrown
into
the
water
where
at
last,
he
was
drowned.
now
this
brings
us
to
the
main
problem
in
the
case,
which
has
at
least
three
facets
which
i
should
like
to
outline
briefly
before
getting
into
the
substance
of
the
argument.
one
is
the
availability
of
the
doctrine
of
un-seaworthiness
outside
the
jones
act,
coupled
with
a
state
wrongful
death
statute
to
give
a
cause
of
action
to
the
beneficiaries
and
next
of
kin
of
those
persons
who
may
be
killed
wrongfully
in
state
waters,
even
though
the
tort
itself
may
have
taken
place
under
circumstances
which
make
it
a
maritime
tort.
the
second
question
involves
the
question
of
whether
in
the
jones
act
fela
nexus,
the
classes
of
beneficiaries
are
exclusive
or
whether
they
are
cumulative.
and
the
third
involved
the
question
of
the
survival
of
an
action
for
pain
and
suffering
where
there
is
a
short
interval
between
the
time
that
those
acts
which
ultimately
results
in
death
begin
to
occur
and
the
time
that
death
in
fact
takes
place,
and
--
mr.
jack
g.
day
it
was
treated
as
a
final
order
your
honor.
mr.
jack
g.
day
i
think
it
is
for
this
reason,
because
the
motion
to
strike
took
out
of
the
petition
of
the
complaint,
all
reference
to
wrongful
death
by
virtue
of
an
un-seaworthy
condition,
all
reference
to
wrongful
death
statutes,
state
statutes,
all
reference
to
state
survival
statutes
for
all
practical
purposes,
the
rights
of
those
persons
other
than
that
one
in
the
primary
class
under
the
jones
act
were
foreclosed.
so
in
effect,
we
have
a
final
order
as
to
them.
we
have
it
particularly
since
there
is
no
other
statute
such
as
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
under
which
they
might
bring
an
action
even
though
precluded
from
bringing
one
under
the
jones
act.
so
in
that
sense,
it
was
quite
final.
mr.
jack
g.
day
yes
sir,
that's
right.
mr.
jack
g.
day
sister,
that's
right.
mr.
jack
g.
day
single
complaint.
mr.
jack
g.
day
and
survival,
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
g.
day
yes.
mr.
jack
g.
day
we
then
got
a
petition
and
a
motion
for
relief
to
file
the
petition
for
mandamus
mandatory
injunction
or
other
relief
which
on
behalf
of
the
other
possible
members
of
the
class,
if
we
were
speaking
in
terms
of
the
wrongful
death
statute.
mr.
jack
g.
day
and
we
asked
that
the
court
of
appeals
order
the
district
court
to
do
one
of
several
things.
one,
to
overrule
the
motion
to
strike
or
if
it
insisted
upon
sustaining
the
motion
to
strike,
to
make
those
findings
under
28
u.s.c.
1292
(b)
which
would
make
it
possible
for
us
to
deal
with
it
on
an
appellate
basis.
mr.
jack
g.
day
that's
right,
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
g.
day
that
motion
was
denied
but
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
which
was
filed
by
the
present
respondent
here
was
also
denied.
mr.
jack
g.
day
that's
right,
on
the
ground
that
it
would
not
hurt
the
present
respondent
and
that
it
was
agreed
by
the
administrator
and
by
her
awards
that
the
court
should
decide
the
case
at
that
point.
and
in
the
interest
of
--
mr.
jack
g.
day
well
perhaps
--
mr.
jack
g.
day
well,
i
think
you
can
infer
though
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
this
was
a
hardship
proposition.
this
was
a
case
in
which
there
was
in
fact
a
final
order
to
decide,
and
that
it
would
expedite
the
trial
of
the
case
to
determine
these
issues
as
to
which
there
was
a
substantial
issue
at
the
outset.
mr.
jack
g.
day
well
obviously
sir
--
mr.
jack
g.
day
no
sir,
i
think
we
have
not
--
mr.
jack
g.
day
we
took
that
for
granted,
i
think,
both
of
us
possibly,
mr.
koykka
will
speak
for
himself,
but
i
had
assumed
that
there
was
no
question
jurisdictionally
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
jack
g.
day
no
sir,
there
was
not.
our
petition
for
mandamus
indicated
that
he
had
expressed
himself
so
forcibly
about
the
merits
of
the
proposition,
there's
no
point
in
trying
for
the
certificate.
mr.
jack
g.
day
that's
right.
we
felt
it
was
unnecessary
because
we
had
what
we
--
we
didn't
get
a
judgment
we
wanted,
but
at
least
we
had
a
final
judgment
and
that
we
thought
enabled
us
to
come
here.
now,
i
have
suggested
that
we
have
these
three
principal
issues
and
in
perfect
candor,
let
me
say
to
the
court
that
in
large
measure,
our
case
rises
and
falls
with
whatever
vitality
may
still
be
in
lindgren.
if
lindgren
is
still
the
law,
we
are
in
considerable
trouble,
unless
the
court
sees
fit
to
decide
that
the
classes
of
beneficiary,
primary
and
deferred
as
it
has
been
referred
to
in
some
cases
or
preferred
and
deferred.
unless
the
court
finds
that
those
are
cumulative
rather
than
alternative.
and
i
do
not
think
that
is
a
point
that
i
would
abandon
in
my
argument
here,
but
certainly,
it
is
not
the
primary
point.
the
primary
point
is
that
we
have
a
right
under
the
doctrine
of
un-seaworthiness
coupled
with
the
state
wrongful
death
statute
to
perceive,
to
file
a
lawsuit
and
to
recover
for
wrongful
death
based
on
a
maritime
tort
for
which
a
state
court
provides
and
a
state
statute
provides
a
remedy.
and
the
same
argument
follows
with
respect
to
the
pain
and
suffering
claim
with
the
added
fact
that
we
have
the
corsair
problem
of
the
short
interval.
and
we
don't
think
that
short
intervals
ought
to
be
determined
in
terms
of
a
ruling
by
a
court
as
a
matter
of
law,
but
rather
as
a
matter
of
evidence.
now
if
there's
anything
at
all
to
the
short
interval,
it
ought
to
be
determined
after
we've
had
a
chance
to
adduce
evidence
and
not
before.
mr.
jack
g.
day
just
on
the
pleadings,
that's
right.
so
what
is
said
in
our
pleading
must
i
think
be
taken
as
true
for
all
practical
purposes.
now,
this
leads
me
to
some
consideration
of
the
proposition
in
lindgren
that
the
jones
act
was
intended
to
preempt
all
actions
for
wrongful
death,
at
least
by
employees
basing
their
claim
on
--
against
their
employers
basing
their
claim
on
un-seaworthiness.
first
place,
may
i
say
if
i
have
this
slightly
running
stock,
that
the
osceola
case
decided
a
long
time
ago,
1903
as
i
recall
it,
prompted
congress
at
last
to
pass
the
merchant
marine
act
of
1915
in
which
they
thought
that
they
were
overturning
the
rule
which
had
been
announced
in
osceola
and
which
they
read
as
being
a
rule
making
it
impossible
for
an
employee
to
recover
for
a
tort
committed
by
a
fellow
servant.
now,
chelentis
decided
in
1917
made
it
quite
clear
that
this
court
at
least
felt
that
whoever
drafted
for
congress
and
whoever
persuaded
congress
had
misread
the
rule
on
osceola.
and
accordingly,
there
came
about
the
jones
act
of
1920,
and
in
determining
what
the
jones
act
wished
to
do
or
thought
it
could
do,
i
think
it's
kind
of
important
to
realize
that
the
jones
act,
and
i'm
sure,
i'm
bringing
owls
to
athens
when
i
tell
this
to
the
court,
that
the
congress
had
little
or
no
debate
about
the
jones
act.
such
legislative
history
as
can
be
found
is
in
conference
reports
and
does
not
get
to
the
meat
of
the
act.
it
simply
is
to
questions
of
jurisdiction
where
suit
shall
be
brought
and
the
like.
and
in
paragraphs,
nothing
voluminous
at
all
and
it
is
not
clear
by
any
means
that
the
congress
had
anything
particular
in
mind,
when
it
passed
the
jones
act,
unless
it
be
that
it
hoped
to
recoup
from
the
osceola
decision
what
it
had
attempted
to
get
when
it
passed
the
act
of
1915.
and
that
was
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
there
could
be
a
right
among
other
things.
there
could
be
a
right
to
recover
for
negligent
tort
in
a
maritime
situation
where
an
employee
was
suing
his
employer.
now
before
a
preemption
in
the
absence
of
something
--
mr.
jack
g.
day
in
which
legislation
sir?
mr.
jack
g.
day
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
jack
g.
day
separately,
i
think
that's
true,
but
there
--
in
the
jones
act
there
was
little
consideration
of
anything,
it's
only
a
paragraph
that
incorporated
fela
by
reference
as
you
know
sir.
now
in
determining
whether
under
such
circumstances
there
has
been
a
preemption,
it
is
very
hard
to
find
any
clear
intent
which
is
one
of
the
standards
that
this
court
has
laid
down
for
determining
when
preemption
should
apply,
clear
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
knock
out
a
wrongful
death
action
based
upon
the
un-seaworthiness
doctrine
coupled
with
those
matters
which
might
provide
a
remedy
in
the
state
statutes,
very
difficult
to
find
any
clear
intent
to
do
that.
and
particularly,
i
think,
since
we're
now
dealing
with
the
awards
of
the
sea,
we're
supposed
to
have
a
special
place
in
the
heart
of
admiralty.
as
it
stands,
the
survivors
of
the
award
are
treated
like
very
poor
relations
indeed
because
they
remain
one
of
the
few
survivors
who
cannot
recover
for
any
support
or
any
financial
benefit
they
derived
from
the
deceased
person.
now
moreover,
this
court
has
said
on
more
than
one
occasion
that
you
do
not
find
preemption
between
state
and
federal
statutory
efforts,
unless
a
fair
interpretation
reveals
an
actual
conflict,
must
be
direct
and
positive.
and
as
long
as
there
is
an
area
which
congress
has
not
preempted
or
which
the
clear
intendment
of
what
it
did
would
call
for
an
interpretation
of
clear
preemption
then
the
state
statute
can
stand.
now
since
--
mr.
jack
g.
day
that's
right.
mr.
jack
g.
day
well,
without
meaning
to
be
disrespectful
to
congress,
i
think
it
was
a
thoughtless
incorporation
and
i
--
mr.
jack
g.
day
well
that's
what
they
did,
but
in
terms
of
what
they
did
and
in
terms
of
the
background
of
the
two
statutes,
they
came
from
different
sources.
the
matrix
of
each
was
quite
different.
the
jones
came
out
of
the
osceola
situation
where
there
was
an
attempt,
i
think,
to
broaden
what
osceola
had
narrowed.
fela
arose
at
a
time
or
there
were
several
efforts
in
fela
as
i
recall
it,
at
least
two
federal
employer
liability
acts,
and
it
came
at
the
time
when
the
nation
was
having
quite
a
struggle
over
the
workman's
compensation
statutes.
and
so
this
problem
was
in
the
mind
of
the
congress,
the
question
of
the
relationship
between
fela
and
workmen's
compensation
statutes
was
clearly
at
in
mind
of
congress
at
the
time
it
dealt
with
the
question
of
fela.
i
think
the
same
statement
cannot
be
made
about
the
intent
of
congress
at
the
time
it
dealt
with
the
jones
act,
quite
different
situations.
now
--
mr.
jack
g.
day
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
g.
day
that's
right
sir.
mr.
jack
g.
day
that's
right,
i
think
that's
true.
it
boils
down
to
this,
that
if
a
seaman
is
killed
on
navigable
waters,
while
in
the
employee
of
his
employer
and
has
a
claim
for
death
against
his
employer,
his
beneficiaries
cannot
recover.
but
if
he's
killed
on
the
high
seas,
if
he
is
a
stevedore
at
shore
side
in
navigable
waters,
if
he
is
a
repairman
at
shore
side
in
navigable
waters,
if
he
is
a
maintenance
foreman
at
shore
side
in
navigable
waters
then
he
can
recover.
mr.
jack
g.
day
that's
right.
mr.
jack
g.
day
oh,
no
question,
i'm
not
suggesting
at
all.
jones
act
is
an
act
which
depends
upon
employment.
mr.
jack
g.
day
sure,
i
think
--
mr.
jack
g.
day
quite
right.
i
make
the
point
only
for
the
sake
of
showing
that
it
is
a
very
doubtful
proposition
that
congress
should
have
intended
to
take
the
special
award
of
the
sea
and
treat
him
in
this
discriminatory
manner.
mr.
jack
g.
day
right,
if
he's
killed
in
his
employment.
mr.
jack
g.
day
that's
right
sir.
mr.
jack
g.
day
yes
sir
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
jack
g.
day
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
jack
g.
day
that's
right.
i
can't
believe
that
congress
meant
anything
--
mr.
jack
g.
day
i
can't
--
mr.
jack
g.
day
same
year,
1920
yes
sir.
i
can't
believe
that
any
such
discrimination
was
intended
by
the
congress.
now,
in
the
meantime
as
i
have
suggested,
and
i
think
as
justice
stewart
has
suggested
makes
little
difference.
i
have
suggested
that
it
is
possible
to
use
the
doctrine
of
un-seaworthiness,
a
concept
peculiar
to
seamen
to
recover,
utilizing
as
well
as
a
remedy
the
wrongful
death
statutes
of
the
state
for
the
beneficiaries
of
people
who
are
not
seamen
in
the
technical
sense
of
the
term.
in
the
effect,
what
has
happened
is
that
we
have
had
an
attempt
to
make
progress
for
a
seaman
which
has
left
him
in
worst
condition
than
he
was
before.
in
the
meantime,
this
court
has
made
some
enormous
changes
in
the
effect
of
death
in
maritime
presence.
i'm
suggesting
that
it
is
time
to
make
yet
one
more.
you
have
said,
for
example,
that
a
state
statute
may
be
used
to
offer
the
rule
that
a
liability
dies
with
the
tortfeasor,
you
have
said
that
a
state
wrongful
death
statute
includes
un-seaworthiness,
so
that
a
non-seaman
may
have
a
course
of
action
or
his
personal
representative
may
after
he
has
been
killed
at
shore
side.
and
as
he
said
in
response
to
mr.
justice
goldberg's
question
that
death
on
the
high
seas
act
will
give
a
remedy
for
un-seaworthiness
to
a
seaman,
even
though
would
also
have
an
act
under
the
--
a
course
of
action
under
the
jones
act.
mr.
jack
g.
day
that
would
be
the
judith
rose
lee
case,
and
it's
in
the
brief.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
defective
shackle
pin,
a
latent
defect
and
it
lowered
material
upon
the
mate
and
killed
him
and
his
action
was
brought.
now,
i
don't
want
--
mr.
jack
g.
day
alright
sir,
i'll
give
you
that
in
just
one
moment.
mr.
jack
g.
day
all
right,
let
me
look
at
the
index
of
the
brief
and
it
will
be
quite
simple.
it's
not
a
decision
by
this
court,
i
should
say
that.
mr.
jack
g.
day
all
right,
it's
the
--
i'll
give
it
to
you,
i'm
going
to
reserve
five
minutes
and
i'll
give
it
to
you
when
i
get
up
the
next
time.
i'll
find
it
then.
mr.
jack
g.
day
no
sir,
i
think
there
is
none.
now,
i
come
then
to
the
conclusion.
well
i
should
say
one
other
thing
before
i
come
to
the
conclusion.
that
although
the
court
talked
about
preemption
in
somewhat
broader
terms
in
lindgren,
it
also
chose
to
look
at
the
language
in
the
jones
act,
short
as
that
act
is,
to
find
some
further
support
for
its
proposition
that
congress
had
in
mind,
that
there
could
be
an
election
between
un-seaworthiness
as
against
negligence
causes
of
action
where
only
personal
injury
was
concerned
because
of
language
in
the
first
paragraph,
the
first
section
of
the
act,
and
none,
no
such
election
for
purposes
of
wrongful
death
because
that
same
at
his
election
language
was
omitted
from
the
second
phrase.
now
for
a
time,
this
was
thought
to
be
a
substantive
difference,
but
since
this
court's
decision
in
mcallister
versus
magnolia
petroleum,
i
think
it
is
quite
clear,
that's
a
personal
injury
case
and
not
a
death
case,
it
is
quite
clear
that
this
election
that
is
provided
in
the
first
portion
of
the
statute
is
not
a
substantive
matter
but
simply
a
procedural
one.
so
we
have
this
situation
that
while
the
expansion,
the
dynamism
of
the
admiralty
law
has
been
going
outward
to
include
people
who
are
not
the
special
awards
of
the
sea,
the
special
awards
have
been
left
behind
and
their
beneficiaries
cannot
recover
except,
and
unless
they're
in
a
jones
act
situation
where
they
are
killed
at
shore
side.
and
this
rule
has
persisted
as
the
cases
cited
in
our
brief
show
and
is
the
case
that
brings
us
here
shows.
now,
on
the
question
of
classes
of
beneficiaries,
i
must
say
that
unless
this
personal
representative,
this
petitioner
prevails
on
the
question
of
the
right
to
bring
an
un-seaworthiness
action
coupled
with
the
remedy
provided
with
the
wrongful
death
statute
in
the
state
of
ohio,
he
can
get
only
a
consolation
prize
or
no
prize
at
all
unless
the
classes
of
beneficiaries
which
are
provided
in
the
fela
as
read
into
the
jones
act,
are
considered
as
cumulative
and
not
exclusive.
candor
compels
me
to
say
that
this
is
hard
road,
a
hole
in
the
light
of
a
language
in
the
fela.
however,
it
is
true
that
there
have
been
examples
which
will
show
that
simply
being
cut
off,
case
examples
which
will
show
that
simply
being
cut
off
by
virtue
of
being
in
a
deferred
rather
than
preferred
class
under
the
jones
act
does
not
prevent
another
action
under
another
statute.
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
for
example,
if
one
chooses
to
file
it.
now
that
is
not
available
in
this
case
because
there
is
no
death
on
the
high
seas
act
available
to
any
of
the
people
who
were
involved
here.
i've
already
suggested
that
as
far
as
the
claim
for
conscience,
pain
and
suffering
goes,
i
don't
think
anyone
contends
that
you
cannot
base
that
these
days
or
an
un-seaworthiness
whether
you're
a
seaman
or
not,
the
issue
there
and
here
is
whether
the
corsair
rule
on
short
pain
and
short
suffering
forecloses
these
petitioners.
i
suggest
to
the
court,
as
i
have
suggested
that
the
place
to
determine
that
will
be
on
trial
where
we
determine
whether
or
not
our
evidence
shows,
whether
any
considerable
or
at
least
compensable
period
of
suffering
took
place.
i'll
reserve
five
minutes.
mr.
jack
g.
day
may
it
please
the
court.
since
i
was
asked
before
i
sat
down
last
to
come
up
with
a
citation,
i
have
it
now.
it's
--
mr.
jack
g.
day
(inaudible)
is
the
first
part
of
the
style
of
the
case
and
that's
the
reasons
i
couldn't
find
it
under
judith
rose
lee.
mr.
jack
g.
day
the
citation
is
211
f.
supp.
36
affirmed
in
317
f.2d
927
cert.
denied
375
united
states
931.
mr.
jack
g.
day
that's
the
22nd
item
in
our
list
of
cases.
now
i
want
to
respond
very
briefly
to
the
suggestion
that
if
there
was
such
that
there
is
no
money
involved
in
the
difference
in
positions.
there's
a
great
deal
of
money
involved
because
in
point
of
fact,
the
person
who
is
--
stands
to
suffer
most
by
a
failure
to
prevail
in
connection
with
the
question
whether
or
not
we
can
use
un-seaworthiness
plus
the
wrongful
death
statute
of
the
state
to
recover.
the
person
who
will
suffer
most
in
our
failure
to
prevail
on
that
point
is
the
sister
who
is
fully
dependent
and
who
has
a
mental
defect
as
well
as
other
brothers
and
sisters,
but
she
in
particular.
unless
of
course,
this
court
should
hold
that
there
is
a
--
an
accumulation
of
classes
rather
than
an
alternative
classes
in
connection
with
fela,
without
surrendering
or
retreating
on
that
point
because
i'd
rather
be
defeated
then
to
lose
by
concession.
i
think
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
we
are
not
trying
to
read
something
into
the
jones
act.
we're
trying
to
say
the
jones
act
did
not
encompass
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested,
did
not
encompass
the
question
of
un-seaworthiness.
it
was
designed
to
do
something
about
the
osceola
after
it
found
out
in
chelentis
that
osceola
did
not
cover
a
situation
where
a
negligent
master
caused
an
injury
to
a
plaintiff
seaman.
and
we
are
trying
to
say
that
in
--
there
remained
because
it
was
not
considered
and
was
not
dealt
with
in
the
lindgren
case,
it
wasn't
pledged
in
the
lindgren
case.
there
remained
the
question
of
un-seaworthiness
and
the
lindgren
has
not
decided
that
un-seaworthiness
true
is
not
to
be
coupled
with
the
remedy
provided
by
wrongful
death
statutes.
and
i
don't
think
it's
quite
apt
to
say,
and
then
i
will
sit
down,
that
there
has
been
nothing
since
the
harbors
act
from
this
court,
harbor
and
longshoreman
act,
indicating
that
you
could
apply
un-seaworthiness
plus
a
state
wrongful
death
statute
and
recover.
i
think
that
the
case
of
seas
shipping
versus
sieracki
in
328
u.s.
85
is
such
a
case.
and
of
course
although
we
have
the
row
to
hoe
in
connection
with
unseaworthiness,
there
are
cases
which
have
said
that
faulty
ladders
will
make
unseaworthy
conditions.
mr.
jack
g.
day
the
statute
would,
yes
sir.
i
think
you
would.
