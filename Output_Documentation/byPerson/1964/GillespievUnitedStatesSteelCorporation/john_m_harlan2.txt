justice
john
m.
harlan
the
court
of
appeals
discussed
but
i
don't
find
discussed
in
either
of
your
briefs,
and
was
this
a
final
order?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
know
it
was
treated
that
way
but
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
understand
your
argument
but
the
question
is
whether
it
is
final.
you
had
two
--
you
had
two
in
effect
two
causes
of
action
here
didn't
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
one
which
you
brought
--
your
client
brought
as
administratrix
of
the
decedent's
estate,
and
the
other
in
which
he
is
sued
as
a
guardian
of
an
incompetent
child
or
incompetent
sister
or
brother,
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
a
single
complaint.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
district
court
struck
all
the
allegations
that
related
to
the
un-seaworthiness
count
and
to
all
references
to
the
state
for
wrongful
death
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
survival,
yes.
and
in
that
posture,
you
took
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
as
administratrix.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
you
take
an
appeal
as
guardian?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
interlocutory
appeal
bases?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that
motion
was
denied?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
in
effect,
as
i
read
its
opinion,
that
both
sides
here
agreed
that
it
would
be
much
more
convenient
to
have
these
questions
decided
at
the
threshold
of
the
case
and
really
on
that
basis
took
the
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
this
is
a
jurisdictional
matter.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
parties
can't
just
by
agreement
and
convenience
confer
jurisdiction
on
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
realize
that,
that's
what
it
said,
but
the
question
is
whether
it
could
do
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
neither
of
your
briefs
have
this?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i
would
like
to
see
that
question
briefed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
not
appealed,
you,
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
here,
you
didn't
raise
the
question
of
the
refusal
to
issue
mandamus.
you
--
your
petition
is
directed
solely
to
the
appeal
on
the
merits.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
didn't
mean
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
you
brief
before
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
john
m.
harlan
perhaps
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
motion
to
dismiss
or
--
