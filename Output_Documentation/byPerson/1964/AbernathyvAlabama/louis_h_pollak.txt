mr.
louis
h.
pollak
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
out
of
the
freedom
rights
of
may
1961.
the
case
comes
to
this
court
on
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
alabama,
a
judgment
which
affirmed
convictions
of
the
11
petitioners
involved
in
this
case,
11
convictions
rendered
by
the
montgomery
circuit
court.
ten
of
the
11
petitioners
were
convicted
both
of
breach
of
peace
and
of
unlawful
assembly.
the
eleventh,
a
reverend
wyatt
walker
was
found
guilty
only
of
the
latter
account
of
unlawful
assembly,
but
all
eleven
received
the
same
sentence,
30
days
in
jail
and
$100
fine
which
sentences
of
course
are
in
suspension
pending
review
here.
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
alleged
breach
of
peace
consisted
and
i
refer
here
to
the
solicitor's
complaint
on
the
basis
of
which
these
cases
were
tried
in
the
circuit
court
consisted
in
the
petitioner's
sitting
down
as
a
“racially
mixed
group”
at
a
lunch
counter
in
the
trailway's
bus
terminal
in
montgomery
at
a
time
in
may
of
1961
when
montgomery
was
under
a
state
of
limited
martial
law.
reverend
walker
was
charged
only
--
was
convicted
only
of
unlawful
assembly,
not
of
the
breach
of
the
peace
itself
because
he
was
not
one
of
those
who
actually
sat
at
the
counter,
he
merely
was
alleged
to
have
conspired
with
the
others
to
sit
at
the
counter.
now,
if
the
court
please,
as
i
shall
try
to
demonstrate
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
yes
--
no,
the
record
doesn't
disclose
this
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
declaration
was,
if
my
recollection
is
right,
by
the
governor
and
what
it
meant
for
the
time
period
involved
which
was
made
21st
through
25th
was
that
the
city
of
montgomery
was
in
--
for
law
enforcement
purposes
controlled
by
the
montgomery
national
guard
under
the
command
of
general
graham,
the
commander
of
the
guard
of
whom
we
will
hear
more
in
a
second.
it
was
--
i
say
limited
martial
law,
in
the
sense
that,
as
you
will
also
see
the
civil
officials
were
still
operating
under
military
direction.
now,
petitioners
submit
that
a
review
of
these
facts,
which
i'm
about
to
narrate,
will
show
that
the
instant
convictions
are
vulnerable
on
almost
more
federal
constitutional
and
statutory
basis
than
i
can
account
as
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
in
the
broader
sense
and
that
these
prosecutions
were
plainly
designed
to
enforce
racial
segregation.
as
denial
of
free
speech
in
the
sense
that,
the
act
of
these
petitioners
in
sitting
as
a
racially
mixed
group
at
a
lunch
counter
was
for
them
a
symbolic
utterance
of
their
commitment
to
desegregation,
but
they
were
denied
procedural
due
process
in
the
basic
thompson
versus
louisville
or
vagueness
senses
in
that
nothing
they
did
could
be
equated
by
any
conventional
standard
with
a
breach
of
the
peace
or
if
it
is
then
--
if
it
is
under
alabama
law,
breach
of
the
peace
to
sit
at
a
lunch
counter
then
that
is
a
statute
which
does
not
give
warning
of
its
meaning
and
that
all
of
the
petitioners
were
denied
rights
under
the
--
which
have
been
declared
by
this
court
in
boynton
versus
virginia,
statutory
rights
under
the
motor
carriers
act
declared
by
this
court
in
boynton
versus
virginia
just
five
months
before
this
episode
arose,
the
scene
of
this
episode
being
an
interstate
bus
terminal.
now,
this
of
course
requires
and
what
i
intend
to
devote
most
of
my
time
to
a
recital
of
the
facts
because
if
i
may
refer
to
a
question
which
mr.
justice
stewart
put
to
mr.
greenberg
at
the
beginning
of
the
hamm
argument
he
said
there
could
be
a
real
case
of
unlawful
assembly,
could
there
not
and
mr.
greenberg
said,
indeed
there
could
be
a
situation
in
which
people
would
vigorously
assert
their
rights
to
the,
extent
of
throwing
sugar
balls.
i
intend
to
show,
i
think
i
can
i
satisfy
this
court,
this
is
not
in
any
sense
a
sugar
ball
throwing
case.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
do
mr.
justice
and
i
should
hasten
to
say
at
this
point
that
in
the
catalog
of
federal
questions
i
have
recited,
you'll
note
that
i
did
not
include
the
new
federal
civil
rights
act.
i
don't
reject
the
act
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
fully
realize
that
but
i
thought
i
had
to
carry
over
to
this
situation.
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
i
reject
the
federal
civil
rights
act
and
mr.
greenberg's
argument
for
this
purpose,
but
it's
a
--
i
think
indeed
i
suppose
i
could
--
petitioners
could
claim
a
sort
of
innocence
by
association
with
the
contention
to
which
mr.
greenberg
and
senator
motley
have
made.
but
the
federal
questions
which
have
been
in
this
case
from
the
beginning
at
every
level
of
the
proceedings
i
think
are
sufficient
to
our
purposes.
on
may
20,
as
this
court
may
remember
as
well
all
remember
just
as
citizens,
the
first
group
of
may
20
of
1961',
the
first
group
of
freedom
riders
came
to
montgomery.
they
were
met
by
violence.
on
may
21,
the
following
day
which
was
a
sunday,
late
in
that
day,
montgomery
was
placed
under
the
martial
law
which
i
have
described
as
i
say
i
think
by
governor's
determination.
at
all
events,
it
meant
that
general
graham
was
in
command
of
the
city
for
the
next
four
days
at
least.
meanwhile,
the
violent
events
of
may
20th
were
widely
disseminated
throughout
the
nation
by
television
and
newspaper.
among
those
--
some
of
these
events
i
meant
most,
were
read
most
deeply
was
one
of
the
one
of
the
petitioners
today,
john
maguire,
a
professor
of
religion
at
wesleyan
university.
professor
maguire
had
been
born
in
montgomery.
he
telephoned
a
friend,
reverend
william
s.
coffin
jr.,
at
the
chaplain
of
yale
university,
and
suffice
it
to
say
that
they
talked
the
matter
over
and
within
the
next
48
hours
they
decided
that
they
would
go
to
montgomery
which
they
did
in
company
with
three
others,
professor
gaylord
noyce,
of
the
yale
divinity
school;
professor
david
swift,
chairman
of
the
wesleyan
department
of
religion;
george
smith,
then
a
law
student
at
yale
law
school
and
now
a
member
of
the
bar.
of
the
four
--
out
of
the
five,
smith
was
a
negro,
the
other
four
were
white,
they
left
new
haven
on
tuesday,
may
23rd,
traveled
to
atlanta,
stayed
overnight
there,
and
went
by
bus
on
wednesday
the
24th,
the
day
before
their
arrest
to
montgomery.
by
now,
their
group
had
swollen
to
seven
because
in
atlanta,
they
encountered
two
negro
theological
students,
clyde
porter
and
joseph
charles
jones
who
accompanied
them.
in
montgomery,
they
stayed
overnight,
the
night
of
the
24th.
on
the
morning
of
the
25th
and
this
brings
us
to
the
events
which
are
decisive,
on
the
morning
of
the
25th,
they
determined
that
they
would
go
on
from
montgomery
to
jackson,
mississippi.
now,
they
decided
this
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
the
previous
day,
two
bus
loads,
two
prior
bus
loads
of
freedom
riders
had
left
from
montgomery
and
had
gone
to
the
jackson
and
indeed
have
been
arrested
and
the
arrest
in
jackson
were
the
first
arrests
--
well,
none
of
them
--
nobody
had
been
arrested,
no
freedom
riders
have
been
arrested
in
montgomery,
but
it
was
known
that
the
groups
which
had
left
montgomery
were
arrested
in
jackson.
suffice
it
to
say
these
seven
travelers
decided
to
leave
on
thursday
morning
for
jackson.
pursuant
to
a
request
made
by
general
graham,
who
as
i
say
was
in
command
of
the
city
at
this
time,
pursuant
to
a
request
made
by
him
that
he
be
advised
of
any
movement,
the
seven
travelers
telephoned
his
headquarters
and
said
they
would
like
to
take
the
11:30
or
12:00
bus
to
jackson
and
would
like
to
be
--
if
that
was
the
wish
of
the
military
to
be
conveyed
down
at
the
trailway's
bus
terminal
and
so,
a
military
convoy
came,
before
the
seven,
they
were
staying
at
the
home
of
reverend
abernathy,
then
a
pastor
in
montgomery.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
the
state
national
guard
mr.
justice.
they
have
not
been
nationalized,
no
mr.
justice
harlan.
this
was
the
state
national
guard.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i'm
sure
he
is
though,
i
can't
tell
it
to
you
on
the
record
mr.
justice
stewart.
he
was
the
commander
of
the
alabama
national
guard.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
of
the
state
national
guard.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
believe
so
and
i'm
sure
it
says
so
in
the
statutes
of
alabama,
if
we
can
take
notice
of
them
but
again
we
don't
have
this
in
the
record.
the
military
convoy
of
several
cars
took
the
seven
would
be
travelers
plus
four
companions,
who
are
going
down
to
the
bus
station
to
see
them
off
down
to
the
bus
terminal,
the
trailways
bus
terminal.
the
four
companions
were
reverend
abernathy,
reverend
walker
whom
i've
mentioned
as
having
been
charged,
convicted
of
only
one
of
these
offenses,
reverend
shuttlesworth,
whom
i
think
this
court
will
take
judicial
recollection
of
as
a
frequent
recipient
of
the
court's
hospitality,
and
bernard
lee,
all
four
negro's.
the
eleven
were
driven
by
military
convoy
to
the
bus
terminal.
now,
when
they
reached
the
bus
terminal
and
i
must
call
upon
your
sense
of
visualization
here,
the
street
on
which
the
terminal
faced
was
blocked
off
by
the
military,
lee
street.
there
were
crowds
estimated
from
300
to
500
people
beyond
the
troops
which
meant
across
the
street
from
the
bus
terminal
and
at
the
ends
of
the
street
but
some
--
but
troops,
state
national
guardsmen,
who
numbered
at
least
a
100
on
some
of
the
estimates,
general
graham's
estimate
went
up
to
several
hundred
were
disposed
outside
the
terminal
and
between
the
terminal
and
the
crowd.
the
military
convoy
went,
took
the
group
of
a
11
into
a
rear
entrance,
and
off
the
street
entrance
to
the
bus
terminal
and
they
entered
by
that
rear
entrance
at
the
point
where
they
were
in
effect,
guided
to
by
the
military.
they
went
into
the
only
available
entrance
which
was
a
rear
entrance
to
that
so-called
“white
waiting
room”.
now,
that
white
waiting
room
--
let
me
put
it
this
way,
if
the
court
please,
if
i
can
–
if
in
your
mind
you
will
imagine
that
you
have
no
curtains
or
columns
behind
you
and
they
entered
a
rear
door
somewhat
behind
where
mr.
justice
white's
seat
would
be
and
where
--
that
was
where
they
were
to
come
in
at
the
guidance
of
the
military.
inside
the
waiting
room
was
a
lunch
counter,
at
this
point,
i
may
use
your
bench
as
that
lunch
counter
which
was
the
extreme
wall,
a
lunch
counter
which
ran
along
this
way
and
sort
of
curved
around
approximately
where
mr.
louis
is
sitting
and
out
there
would
be
lee
street
with
about
--
windows
about
ten
feet
back
of
mr.
louis
but
no
window
giving
on
to
this
extended
lunch
counter
and
back
over
there,
somewhat
to
the
rear
of
mr.
justice
brennan
was
the
ticket
counter.
now,
i
give
all
these
details
because
this
is
the
setting
of
our
episode.
within
the
white
waiting
room
into
which
this
racially
mixed
group
were
guided
with
the
ticket
counter
and
the
white
lunch
counter
and
they
were
about
50
people,
guardsmen,
other
local
law
enforcement
officers
including
the
sheriff,
and
travelers,
and
just
hangers-on,
and
newspaper
reporters.
the
seven
travelers
bought
their
tickets
and
then
the
entire
group
or
almost
the
entire
group
with
the
exception
of
reverend
walker
proceeded
to
come
toward
the
lunch
counter
to
sit
down,
but
just
before
as
they
were
just
before
this
movement
towards
the
counter,
three
white
toughs
as
they
were
described
by
colonel
porch,
the
second
senior
guardsmen
in
command.
colonel
porch
was
in
the
room,
general
graham,
the
commanding
general
was
in
the
room
and
sheriff
butler,
these
were
the
senior
law
enforcement
officers
there.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
yes.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
the
record
shows
mr.
justice
that
the
arrangement
--
the
prearrangement
was
made
by
a
request
from
general
graham
or
general
graham's
headquarters.
colonel
porch's
testimony
is
precise
on
that.
i
think
if
you
will
look
at
page
143
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
the
middle
of
the
page
on
143,
“were
you
aware
of
any
arrangement
that
general
graham
had
made
with
reverend
walker,
asking
reverend
walker
at
any
time,
anyone
from
reverend
abernathy's
house
wanted
to
go
any
place
to
let
his
office
know?
yes,
i
was
aware
of
that.
“was
it
not
--
and
it
was
--
pursuant
to
that
arrangement
that
this
military
convoy
took
place.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
there
is
no
basis
for
any
such
assumption
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
mr.
justice
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
think
that
is
particularly
appropriate
observation
mr.
justice
and
what
characterizes
this
situation
as
i'm
just
about
to
indicate
is
that
there
was
never
any
request
with
which
they
were
not
in
compliance.
no
warning
that
they
did
not
heed.
they
were
at
all
times
in
compliance
with
the
indicated
path
of
duty
and
the
indicated
geographic
path
until
they
were
arrested
with
no
warning
as
for
example,
by
total
contrast
with
edward
versus
south
carolina.
now
i
was
just
about
to
say
that
just
before
the
group
sat
down,
there
were
three
so-called
white
toughs
as
colonel
porch
identified
the
men
who
he
said
were
in
that
room
to
make
trouble,
who
started
pouring
coffee
on
the
seats
of
the
lunch
counter.
how
was
this
met?
colonel
porch
went
to
the
three,
found
out
they
weren't
travelers
and
sent
them
out
of
the
terminal
then
passing
right
by
all
of
those
law
enforcement
officers,
the
group
of
petitioners
sat
down
at
the
lunch
counter.
there
is
some
inconclusive
testimony
that
noise
which
in
any
event
was
high
went
higher
outside.
there
was
also
great
doubt
if
the
crowd
could
see
at
all
into
the
terminal,
though
their
testimony
on
that
point
is
in
conflict.
i
would
only
say
at
this
point
that,
the
only
people
who
testified
us
to
visibility,
who
had
actually
looked
from
across
the
street
into
the
terminal
themselves
to
makes
that
attempt
said
one
couldn't
see,
one
couldn't
tell,
if
one
saw
a
person
certainly
what
race
he
was
but
i
would
acknowledge
that
the
testimony
they
have
may
be
said
to
be
in
conflict.
at
all
events,
in
this
situation
of
noise
and
confusions,
perhaps
--
but
no
--
no
request
not
to
sit
down.
the
group
of
at
least
eight
or
nine,
perhaps
ten
of
the
petitioners
sat
down
at
that
counter,
if
i
may
say
so,
were
served
coffee
and
then
colonel
porch
gave
sheriff
butler
a
signal
and
he
went
--
that
signal
was
understood
by
the
sheriff
to
be
a
signal
to
arrest.
and
if
you
look
at
page
169
of
the
record,
you
will
see
a
photograph
as
i,
said
there
were
news
people
in
the
room
too,
and
there
is
a
photograph
of
sheriff
butler
arresting
the
freedom
riders
and
you
can
see
he's
going
down
the
line
of
the
petitioners
that
i
said,
its
facing
page
168,
a
not
a
very
good
replica
of
a
not
very
good
newspaper
photograph
but
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
mr.
justice
harlan,
this
testimonies
of
the
waitresses
-
waitress
or
waitresses
moved
from
the
counter
to
another
part
of
the
waiting
room
and
then
that
the
counter
manager
served
the
petitioners.
there
is
no
testimony
with
respect
to
any
refusal
but
there
is
testimony
that
a
waitress
or
waitresses
moved
from
one
side
from
the
terminal,
--
from
the
counter.
but
there
was
actual
service
then
by
the
counter
manager.
now
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
there
was
absolutely
no
request.
the
testimony
of
sheriff
butler
is
firm
on
this.
he
made
no
such
request,
he
heard
no
such
request
and
he
said
he
was
so
disposed
standing
in
the
center
of
the
room
that
everybody
must
have
gone
by
him
and
that
he
would
surely
have
heard
anything
of
that
kind.
but
the
decisive
testimony,
if
i
may
say
so,
on
this
issue
as
on
all
issues
i
believe
in
this
case
mr.
justice
harlan
is
the
testimony
at
the
record
on
pages
219
to
220
of
general
graham.
now,
colonel
porch
gave
a
signal
to
sheriff
butler
to
arrest
but
general
graham,
who
was
the
commander
of
all
of
the
guardsmen
and
in
total
control
of
the
city,
testified
that
it
was
he
who
had
signaled
to
colonel
porch
that
the
time
was
now
the
time
for
arrest.
and
this
is
his
testimony
with
respect
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
page
219
to
220
of
the
record.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
did
you
order
the
arrest
of
these
defendants?
yes,
as
the
military
commander
here
at
that
time,
i
did.
you
signaled
to
colonel
porch
simple.
but
the
key
phrases
of
these,
what
was
it
general
that
led
you
to
conclude
that
these
defendants
should
be
arrested?
well
it
was
the
act
of
sitting
together
as
a
group
contrary
to
the
custom,
long
established
custom
here
in
this
community
under
the
circumstances.
what
custom
had
you
in
mind
in
general?
white
people
eat
one
place
and
colored
eat
another,
a
long
established
custom
pretty
well
recognized
by
both
parties
here
in
montgomery.
it
was
the
violation
by
these
defendants
of
that
custom
under
these
circumstances
and
then
the
question
i
went
on
to
ask
the
general
whether
he
had
in
--
you
had
warned
the
defendants
not
to
sit
down?
“no,
i
have
not.”
you
had
instructed
one
of
your
men
to
do
it.
“no”
and
he
knew
of
no
instruction
by
anyone
with
any
warning.
now
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
you
have
absolutely
no
evidence
of
this
whatsoever
mr.
justice.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
it
would
be
an
entirely
different
case.
it
would
at
least
then
bring
you
into
the
realm
of
what
was
in
discussion,
for
example
in
edwards
against
south
carolina
but
this
case
doesn't
even
begin
to
be
that.
it
would
be
as
if
--
if
i
may
use
this
bench
again,
as
if
mr.
lappet
had
guided
all
of
you
into
the
back
door
of
this
courtroom
and
as
you
sat
down,
i'd
put
you
under
arrest.
because
these
petitioners
were
captives,
i
don't
mean,
i
mean
in
the
sense
that
they
were
within
the
control
of
the
military
and
of
general
graham.
they
were
--
as
they
sat
down
--
shall
we
say
informally,
sitting
ducks.
now
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
by
general
graham's
testimony
pages
219
to
220,
mr.
justice
harlan.
now,
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
about
four
principal
matters
which
i
would
like
very
briefly
to
cover
in
the,
i
believe
it
six
minutes
remaining
to
me.
i
think
the
court
had
the
feeling
of
--
for
the
central
facts
which
led
up
to
these
arrests.
i
think
at
this
point
it
becomes
really
decisive
to
contrast
these
arrests
with
two
other
events.
first,
the
non-arrests
of
the
three
men
whom
colonel
porch
described
as
the
three
white
toughs,
whom
he
said
where
they're
to
create
trouble,
who
poured
coffee
on
the
counter
stools
just
before
these
petitioners
sat
down.
it
would
be
my
inference,
although
there
is
certainly
nothing
in
the
record
to
demonstrate
it,
but
the
three
white
toughs
must
have
poured
coffee
on
those
counter
stools
because
they
anticipated
that
petitioners
would
sit
down.
at
all
events,
those
men
were
not
arrested.
now,
the
second
item
with
which
the
treatment
of
these
petitioner
should
be
contrasted
is
that
the
day
before
as
general
hall
has
just
indicted,
the
--
one
of
the
first
groups
of
freedom
riders,
to
leave
from
montgomery
for
jackson
had
left
from
that
very
terminal,
the
trailways
bus
terminal
had
come
in
just
as
this
group
had
to
that
terminal
under
military
custody
into
the
white
waiting
room
and
had
bought
tickets
and
had
sat
down
at
that
launch
counter,
that
same
launch
counter
as
a
racially
mixed
group
and
there
had
been
no
incident
and
there
had
been
no
arrests.
although,
troops
who
were
in
control
and
there
was
a
crowd
of
some
250
to
300
people
outside
the
terminal.
why
the
differential
in
treatment,
we
cannot
know
for
sure?
we
do
know
that
on
the
previous
day,
neither
sheriff
butler
nor
colonel
porch
nor
general
graham,
no
one
of
those
three
officers
was
at
the
white
waiting
room.
but
on
the
day
of
these
arrests,
all
three
were
there
and
there
was
a
difference
in
result.
now,
general
hall
has
said
that
on
the
thursday
the
day
of
these
arrests.
there
were
as
many
as
500
outside
the
terminal
and
only
a
hundred
troops
in
attendance.
there
is
testimony
to
that
effect.
colonel
porch's
testimony
was
that
the
crowd
outside
was
only
300,
just
as
the
day
before
there
had
been
about
250
to
300
outside
the
terminal.
general
graham
said
that
the
troops
he
had
disposed
around
the
terminal
on
the
day
of
the
arrest
of
this
petitioners,
he
said
he
had
several
hundred,
several
hundred
general,
“yes,
several
hundred”.
now,
i
think
general
hall
said
that
general
graham
and
colonel
porch
who
just
come
to
the
conclusion
of
things
had
gone
too
far.
the
arrest
warrant
on
which
these
petitioners
were
tried
in
the
court
of
common
pleas,
quoted
at
the
page
8
of
our
brief,
as
the
court
will
note
sheriff
butler's
arrest
warrant
charges
and
i
refer
to
the
italicized
wording
in
the
middle
of
an
arrest
warrant,
“they
did
willfully
and
intentionally
attempt
to
test
segregation
laws
and
customs.”
that
was
the
contemporaneous
statement
that
morning.
as
to
why
an
arrest
was
sought.
when
sheriff
butler
was
examined
as
to
what
he
meant
by
that,
i
refer
to
page
106
of
the
record.
sheriff
butler
was
asked
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
“as
the
chief
law
enforcement
officer
of
this
county
sir,
can
you
tell
us
what
particular
laws
you
had
in
mind
if
any?”
and
sheriff
butler
testifying
in
november
of
1961,
six
months
after
this
event
said,
“i
don't
know
what
particular
code
it
would
be,
but
i'm
sure
a
lawyer,
speaking
to
mr.
gray.
i
am
sure
lawyer
that
you
know
our
lunch
stand,
cafes
and
other
places
are
segregated.”
how
interesting
thing
is
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
in
december
1960,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
no.
no,
these
events
were
in
may
of
1961.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
the
boynton
case
was
decided
five
months
in
advance
of
this.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
the
interesting
thing
is,
that
of
course
sheriff
butler,
though
he
swore
out
the
arrest
warrants,
he
didn't
himself
praise
the
arrest
warrants.
he
testified
who
did
praise
the
arrest
warrants.
on
page
107
of
the
record,
sheriff
butler
recalls,
“my
recollection
is
that
the
warrants
were
awarded
by
judge
marks,”
judge
marks
was
the
court
of
common
pleas
judge
who
was
to
try
these
petitioners
were
worded
by
judge
marks
with
the
assistance
of
our
solicitor
and
the
lawyer
from
athens,
alabama,
colonel
porch,
who
is
in
service
of
that
time.
so,
this
was
apparently
the
view
that
colonel
porch
and
the
county
solicitor
at
the
time
and
judge
marks
said,
as
to
what
the
arrests
were
about.
now
of
course,
the
trial
in
the
circuit
court,
the
de
novo
trial
in
the
circuit
court,
the
convictions
that
are
under
review
here
was
on
a
solicitor
complaint
departed
in
wording
slightly
from
the
original
arrest
warrant.
that
solicitor's
complaint
is
list
is
--
is
set
forth
on
page
9.
and
this
time,
the
solicitor
charged
that
the
petitioner
did
willfully
and
intentionally
seek
or
attempt
to
seek
service
at
a
public
lunch
counter
with
a
racially
mixed
group,
were
no
longer
told
about
an
attempt
to
test
segregation
laws.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
beg
an
additional
couple
of
minutes.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
thank
you.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
just
of
a
couple
of
minutes
because
there's
one
point
that's
boynton,
i
want
to
get
to.
i
would
say
only
that
the
departure
--
the
solicitor's
departure
from
the
original
arrest
warrant
cannot
change
the
decisive
nature
of
this
case.
and
the
decisive
of
nature
of
this
case,
if
this
court
please,
i
think
is
made
absolutely
plain
by
--
if
the
record
itself
did
not
demonstrated
by
the
decision
of
a
federal
judge
who
was
already
examined,
almost
exactly
this
record.
this
case
is
peculiar.
i
know
of
no
other
in
this
court's
prudence
which
presents
the
situation.
this
court
in
cases
like
edwards
and
finner
and
all
the
rest
that
you
had,
is
in
the
very
difficult
situation
of
having
to
review
the
determinations
of
lower
court
judges,
state
judges,
and
the
determinations
of
a
police
acting
at
the
time.
but
in
this
one
instance,
you
have
the
comfort
not
merely
that
one
of
the
members
of
the
alabama
court
of
appeals
dissented
from
the
--
of
judgment
of
affirmance,
but
that
before
the
state
court
trials
either
of
them
before
the
court
of
common
pleas
or
the
circuit
court
tried
these
petitioners,
petitioners
went
into
judge
johnson's
court
in
the
middle
district
of
alabama
and
sought
an
injunction
against
these
prosecutions
on
the
grounds
that
they
were
for
the
purpose
of
perpetuating
segregation.
judge
johnson
dismissed
on
the
grounds
of
section
2283
of
title
28
for
the
federal
judicial
code,
precluded
his
enjoining
a
state
court
prosecution
and
he
dismissed,
but
he
did
not
dismiss
until
he
had
taken
two
days
of
testimony,
testimony
which
is
almost
reproduces
the
testimony
general
hall
and
i
have
discussed.
on
pages
14
and
15
of
this
record,
if
the
court
please,
you
will
find
judge
johnson's
evaluation
of
this
record.
i
want
you
to
understand
about
judge
johnson
that
the
court
does
not
find
or
believe
that
the
arrest
of
these
individuals
against
to
whom
these
criminal
proceedings
are
now
pending
was
for
any
purpose
other
than
to
enforce
segregation.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
posture
of
the
case,
the
court
is
of
the
opinion
the
arrest
of
those
individuals
was
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
segregation
in
these
facilities.
judge
johnson
dismissed
the
motion
for
an
injunction
against
the
county
solicitor,
because
he
felt
that
the
restraints
of
the
federal
judicial
code
left
him
powerless,
even
though,
he
knew
that
these
were
unconstitutional
prosecutions.
section
2283
imports
restraints,
a
dimension
vital
to
our
federal
system
and
it
assumed,
judge
johnson
must
have
assumed
these
federal
rights
would
be
vindicated
by
the
state
judiciary.
what
was
the
response
of
the
state
court,
judge
carter
said
on
page
117
on
this
record
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
if
i
may
just
give
you
this
one
sentence.
let
just
judge
johnson
rule
his
court
and
i
am
going
to
rule
mine.
