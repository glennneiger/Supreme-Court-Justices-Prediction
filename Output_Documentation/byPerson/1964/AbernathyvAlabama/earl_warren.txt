abernathy
et

versus
alabama.
mr.

proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hall,
may
i
ask
you,
did
the
governor
declared
marshall
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
he
issue
a
proclamation
declaring
a
limited
marshall
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
did
he
merely
send
in
the
troops
to
help
the
local
authority.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
you
could
get
that
for
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
do
that
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
thank
you
very
much.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
illegal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
a
man
entitled
to
travel
for
that
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
the
night
before
they
went
--
when
they
went
to
--
with
the
reverend
abernathy
to
his
home,
there
were
400
or
500
people
across
the
street
who
were
aroused
and
agitated
then
a
great
roar
went
up
when
they
went
to
the
--
started
to
go
into
the
home.
if
they
had
gone
into
the
home
then,
would
they
have
been
guilty
of
a
breach
of
the
peace?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
difference
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
would
--
what
would
the
difference
be
--
under
the
boynton
case,
didn't
they
have
an
absolute
right
to
service
at
that
restaurant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
did,
just
as
much
right
as
they
had
to
go
and
eat
--
at
reverend
abernathy's
home.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
how
do
you
distinguish
those
two
factual
situations?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
said
assume
that
you
have
the
same
crowd
and
the
crowd
reacted
the
same
way
as
they
were
going
into
reverend
abernathy's
home,
would
they
have
arrested
them
then
for
going
in?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
they
had
a
right
to
do
it
and
sustain
the
conviction
as
they
did
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
pollak.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
a
couple
of
minutes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
didn't
get
that
from
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
we
can
get
that
from
your
brief.
you
finish
your
time.
mr.
hall
would
like
to
over
stand
so
that
you
may
have
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
