mr.
leslie
hall
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
as
was
pointed
out
by
mr.
pollak
in
his
opening
statement
yesterday,
each
of
these
petitioners
was
convicted
in
alabama
for
unlawful
assembly
and
all
of
them
were
convicted
for
breach
of
the
peace
except
the
petitioner
wyatt
t.
walker.
now,
mr.
pollak
is
outlined
a
good
many
of
the
facts
existing
in
these
cases
which
were
combined
for
the
purpose
of
trial
and
for
the
purpose
of
argument
before
this
court.
i
would
like
to
add
to
what
he
said,
a
few
things
that
we
think
that
should
be
pointed
out.
first,
in
the
spring
of
1961
a
wave
of
civil
rights
demonstrations
known
as
freedom
ride
swept
through
the
south
and
it
swept
through
georgia
and
alabama,
mississippi
and
louisiana
among
other
states.
and
using
their
own
words
in
the
support
in
their
brief
here,
their
purpose
was
to
demonstrate
to
the
country
that
negro
travelers
very
often
did
not
enjoy
equal
rights
secured
by
the
law,
that
statement
is
taken
from
page
4
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
i
think
it
is
well
to
point
out
that
this
particular
freedom
ride
was
started
out
by
a
group
of
white
men.
they
consisted
of
professor
coffin,
professor
maguire,
professor
gaylord
noyce
and
--
who
were
joined
on
that
original
jaunt
through
the
south
by
one
david
e
swift,
he
was
the
only
negro
who
started
out
on
this
trip.
when
they
got
down
into
the
carolina,
they
were
joined
by
two
other
negro
theological
students
at
atlanta
and
then
proceeded
on
into
alabama.
when
they
reached
montgomery,
alabama
on
a
greyhound
bus,
they
were
greeted
by
a
crowd
of
some
2,000
people
who
were
very
hostile
to
them.
now,
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
pollak
yesterday,
they
are
had
been
two,
i
believe
or
maybe
three
other
freedom
rides
that
had
preceded
at
this
particular
freedom
ride
and
each
of
these
freedom
rides
had
been
accompanied
by
some
measure
of
violence
on
the
part
of
hostile
crowds.
by
the
time
this
particular
group
arrived
in
montgomery,
the
national
guard,
the
alabama
national
guard
had
been
called
out
by
the
governor,
then
governor
patterson,
for
the
purpose
of
attempting
to
maintain
law
and
order
within
state
of
alabama,
especially
in
the
city
of
montgomery
where
most
of
this
trouble
had
been
taking
place.
some
1400
national
guardsmen
were
on
duty
besides
the
highway
patrol
and
members
of
the
sheriff's
force
and
local
city
police.
however,
the
whole
situation
was
under
the
direction
of
the
national
guard,
under
the
direction
of
general
graham
and
of
course
he
had
his
subordinate
officers
under
him.
mr.
leslie
hall
it
was
known
mr.
chief
justice,
it
wasn't
full
marshall
law.
it
was
a
limited
marshall
law.
mr.
leslie
hall
as
i
understand
that
he
did,
yes
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
haven't
seen
the
proclamation,
but
i
do
know
that
the
troops
came
from
all
over
the
state.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
believe,
i
could,
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
in
any
of
that,
going
back
to
the
arrival
of
this
group
in
montgomery
where
they
were
met
by
reverends
abernathy,
shuttlesworth
and
wyatt
t.
walker,
all
colored
ministers.
this
crowd
of
2,000,
very
hostile
people
met
them
at
the
greyhound
station
and
there
were
bricks
thrown
and
stones
thrown
and
it
was
a
very
intense
and
dangerous
situation.
they
proceeded
to
the
home
of
reverend
abernathy
and
spent
the
night.
they
were
contacted
by
general
graham,
who
asked
them
to
advise
him
when
and
if
they
wanted
to
travel.
the
next
day,
they
advised
general
graham
that
they
wanted
to
travel
on
to
jackson,
mississippi
and
they
intended
to
go
by
trailways
bus.
general
graham
furnished
the
military
escort
for
them
to
the
trailways
station.
when
they
arrived
at
the
trailways
station,
there
was
a
large
crowd
that
people
gathered
across
the
street,
estimated
variously
of
400
to
500
people.
there
were
approximately
a
100
national
guardsmen
stationed
in
front
of
the
station
and
there
were
members
of
the
national
guard
inside
the
station
as
well
as
the
sheriff
of
montgomery
county
and
possibly
other
law
enforcement
officers.
when
the
seven
who
were
actually
intending
to
travel
in
interstate
commerce
arrived
in
the
station
together
with
the
other
four,
the
seven
proceeded
to
the
ticket
vendor
and
bought
tickets
for
jackson,
mississippi.
then
they
went
over
to
the
lunch
counter
and
sat
down
and
ordered
coffee.
when
that
happened,
according
to
the
colonel
porch
who
testified
in
the
case,
there
was
a
large
hue
and
cry
that
went
up
across
the
street.
the
--
colonel
porch,
being
in
charge
of
the
national
guard
detail
there,
became
fearful
because
of
the
tense
and
electric
situation
that
a
riot
might
take
place.
he
then
ordered
the
sheriff
of
montgomery
county
to
arrest
each
one
these
of
parties.
the
arrest
took
place
and
they
were
carried
to
jail,
tried,
convicted
and
sentenced.
now
--
mr.
leslie
hall
sir?
mr.
leslie
hall
how
many
troops
did
they
have?
mr.
leslie
hall
there
were
approximately
a
100
troops
outside
of
the
station
and
some
of
the
officers
of
the
national
guard
inside
the
station.
there
might
have
been
a
few
privates
inside
who
took
part
in
the
escorting
of
this
group
from
reverend
abernathy's
home.
all
together
they
were
variously
estimated
from
30
to
50
people
inside
the
station
including
this
group
and
some
officers.
i
believe
you
said
about
50
yesterday
noon.
mr.
leslie
hall
in
the
city
altogether.
yes,
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
it
will
react
at
the
national
guard
armory,
most
of
them
were
ahead.
mr.
leslie
hall
approximately
a
100
at
the
station.
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
oh,
yes.
they
were
armed.
mr.
leslie
hall
the
armory
is
approximately
among
ahead
from
the
station.
there
are
also
a
several
hundred
united
states
marshals
there
in
town
at
the
time.
it
would
be
--
mr.
leslie
hall
sir?
mr.
leslie
hall
i
don't
know
whether
they
were
in
the
station
or
not,
the
record
didn't
show.
there
was
some
speculation
as
to
whether
they
were
or
not
but
the
record
doesn't
show.
mr.
leslie
hall
inside
the
station?
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
outside
the
station,
400
to
500
people.
now,
i'm
not
going
to
argue
that
these
people
who
are
travelers
in
interstate
commerce
did
not
have
the
right
to
be
served
at
this
counter.
the
crux
of
my
argument
is
that
under
the
existing
circumstances,
they
invite
the
possibility
of
a
riot.
they
actually
insight
it
what
could
have
turn
into
a
serious
riot.
they
actually
were
not
bona
fide
interstate
travelers
in
the
first
place.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
they
came
down
there
for
the
purpose
of
demonstrating
according
to
their
own
statement,
the
fact,
that
negroes
did
not
enjoy
equal
rights
in
the
south.
mr.
leslie
hall
no
sir,
i
don't
think
it
is.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
supposed
he
is,
but
knowing
in
tense
situation
like
they
knew
before
they
started
out
and
deliberately
walking
into
it,
and
deliberately
agitating
a
very
bad
situation
is
a
type
of
thing
that
--
in
my
way
of
thinking
makes
them
guilty
of
breach
of
the
peace
with
unlawful
assembly.
mr.
leslie
hall
no
sir,
they
weren't
warned.
in
fact,
they
were
escorted
by
the
military
troops
there.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes,
sir.
they
were
--
mr.
leslie
hall
they
were
arrested
because
of
the
fact
that
as
soon
as
they
sat
down,
this
great
noise
occurred
on
the
outside
of
the
station.
the
noise
was
--
were
made
by
the
group
of
hostile
people
on
the
outside
of
the
station.
mr.
leslie
hall
there
are
large
plate
glass
windows
in
front
of
the
counter
and
runs
partially
along
the
side
of
the
lobby
and
partially
along
the
front
of
it.
so,
they
could
very
well
see
him
from
where
they
were.
mr.
leslie
hall
no,
sir.
no
the
record
doesn't
show
anyone
warning,
whatsoever.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
what
they
had
done,
they
had
given
themselves
a
great
deal
of
the
advance
publicity
about
what
they
intended
to
do.
and
then,
in
fact,
they
called
the
press
conference
that
morning
at
which
newspaper
reporters
were
present,
radio
announcers
were
present,
television
cameras
were
present,
and
they
made
a
very
particular
effort
to
let
it
be
known,
why
they
were
there?
well,
it
just
goes
back
to
the
fact
that
there
had
been
some
rides
previously
in
the
last
--
within
the
previous
week
and
they
were
met
by
a
hostile
crowd,
they're
still
the
hostile
crowds
there
and
under
all
of
those
circumstances,
they
did
everything
to
agitate
a
very
bad
intense
situation.
mr.
leslie
hall
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
that
affect,
no
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
they
probably
wouldn't
have
been
bothered
whatsoever.
mr.
leslie
hall
there's
an
assumption
on
my
part
from
what
actually
took
place.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
if
it
aggravated
the
electric
atmosphere
on
the
outside
of
the
station
and
that
prompted
the
arrest.
mr.
leslie
hall
it
would
be
different,
i
believe
it
would,
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes
sir,
that's
the
basic
idea.
they
knew
that
--
about
the
tense
situation.
they
did
everything
to
stir
it
up
even
more
and
the
fact,
that
they
did
it
in
the
face
of
all
of
those
--
those
facts
and
went
ahead
and
did
something
they
knew,
it
was
liable
to
precipitate
a
worse
situation,
made
them
guilty
of
breach
of
the
peace
and
unlawful
assembly.
that
is
the
crux
of
the
whole
thing.
mr.
leslie
hall
going
just
--
merely
going
into
his
home?
mr.
leslie
hall
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
mean,
if
he
wanted
them
as
his
guests
that
was
his
business.
mr.
leslie
hall
under
the
boynton
case,
they
did.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
because
the
facts
--
assumed
facts
that
you
mentioned
did
not
exists
when
they
arrived
at
--
mr.
leslie
hall
i
don't
know
what
general
--
colonel
porch
would
have
done
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
can't
answer
to
that,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
leslie
hall
no
sir,
they
didn't.
they
didn't
arrest
any
of
the
people
in
the
crowd
that
met
them
at
the
greyhound
station
who
threw
the
brick
blocks
and
stones
the
day
before.
in
fact,
i
think
on
the
sunday
night
before
the
arrival
of
this
group,
there
was
a
tremendous
riot
outside
of
reverend
abernathy's
church
in
which
a
car
was
overturned
and
burned,
and
the
police
and
the
state
troopers
had
a
terrific
job,
while
trying
to
control
the
crowd.
it
was
a
thing
that
had
been
going
on
for
approximately
a
week.
and
the
national
guard
had
just
very
morning
of
this
event
escorted
another
group
of
freedom
riders
over
to
the
mississippi
line.
it
wasn't
any
difficult
but
when
this
group
followed
on
the
heals
of
the
other
two
groups
that
come
through
there,
general
graham
and
general
porch
just
felt
that
the
things
were
getting
too
far
out
of
hand
and
something
had
to
be
done
there
and
that
was
the
reason.
mr.
leslie
hall
only
except
for
reverend
wyatt
t.
walker.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes,
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
they
did.
they
started
out
with
that
idea
in
mind.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
gentlemen
i
think
everything
else
is
covered
in
my
brief.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
leslie
hall
one
thing
your
honor,
i
have
--
i
have
a
bit
a
minute.
i'd
like
to
point
out
in
answer
to
what
mr.,
pollak
just
said.
another
ruling
by
judge
johnson
which
is
contained
in
pages
17,
18,
and
19
of
our
brief.
and
that
was
the
--
a
ruling
in
which
he
said
that
these
were
not
bona
fide
interstate
travelers
and
he
went
ahead
and
enjoined
various
organizations
including
some
of
these
very
petitioners
here
from
further
agitating
and
creating
a
burden
on
the
interstate
commerce.
