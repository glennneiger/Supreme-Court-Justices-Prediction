there
is
still
another
argument
of
course
that
so
far
as
the
civil
rights
act
goes,
the
new
federal
civil
rights
act
goes,
you're
only
invited
to
ask
for
service
if
you
think
you're
entitled
to
it
under
the
act
and
then
if
you're
asked
to
leave,
you're
obligated
to
leave
and
because
then
you're
only
right
is
to
bring
a
lawsuit.
do
you
understand
that
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
subject
to
my
question
to
mr.
greenberg.
justice
potter
stewart
general
graham
was
representing
the
governor
of
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
state
national
guard.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
that
--
is
the
governor
or
the
commander-in-chief?
justice
potter
stewart
if
we
can
go
back
a
little
bit.
justice
potter
stewart
these
military
people
were
there
by
prearrangement
that
morning
with
the
petitioners
before
they
left
the
home
of
mr.
abernathy.
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
record
show
at
whose
request
this
arrangement
was
made?
justice
potter
stewart
this
had
occurred
to
me
and
just
--
frankly,
thinking
it
out
loud
whether
this
is
in
many
ways
different
from
most
of
the
cases
in
this
general
area
that
we
have
had
here
in
that
you
have
these
people
from
the
beginning
and
by
mutual
agreement
or
prearrangement
in
custody
so
to
speak
of
a
--
and
under
the
protection
of
military
authorities
and
that
question
occurred
to
me
whether
or
not
there
might
not
under
such
a
prearrangement
being
implied
duty
to
conform
to
the
request
that
the
military
authorities
as
they
have
gave
to
this
petitioner.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
quite
different
from,
quite
different
factually
at
the
--
and
to
that
extent
and
in
that
respect
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
at
what
page?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
when
was
the
boynton
case
decided?
justice
potter
stewart
december
of
1960,
after
these
events,
but
before
the
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
1961,
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
five
months.
thank
you.
