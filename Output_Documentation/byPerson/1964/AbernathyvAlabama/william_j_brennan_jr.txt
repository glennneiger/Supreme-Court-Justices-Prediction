justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
mean
mr.
pollak
with
limited
martial
law,
by
formal
declaration,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
said
there
were
1400
national
guardsmen
in
the
city?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
were
they
[inaudible]
somewhere
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
a
100
at
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
mr.
hall?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
hall,
do
i
infer
correctly
from
what
you
said
to
us
had
they
just
stood
around
the
station
until
the
bus
came
and
boarded
the
bus,
there
would
have
been
no
arrests?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gathered
from
what
you've
been
saying
and
that
the
incident
which
really
accounts
with
your
act,
when
they're
sitting
at
the
lunch
counter
asking
for
service
which
your
acknowledge
they
had
a
right
to
ask
or
indeed
they
were
served,
were
they
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
just
that
act
which
prompted
the
arrests
finally?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
hall,
are
these
the
convictions
both
under
407
91
191,
aren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
and
i
gather
if
â€“
you
say
these
facts
--
just
the
fair
conviction
under
407
as
persons
meeting
together
to
commit
a
breach
of
the
peace?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that's
--
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
other
one
under
1-191,
it's
disturbing
the
peace
by
conduct
calculated
provoke
a
breach
of
peace.
