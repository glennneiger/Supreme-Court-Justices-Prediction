mr.
paul
bender
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset
i
would
like
to
–
now
ordering
this
exception
which
i
think
the
petitioner
has
about
our
argument,
we
do
not
argue
that
the
lesser-included
offense
doctrine
has
no
application
to
income
tax
offence
but
that's
not
our
position
and
it
has
never
been
our
position.
the
lesser
included
offence
doctrine,
we
submit,
is
fully
applicable
to
income
tax
offences
in
a
proper
case
but
we
also
agree
as
petitioner
stated
that
these
two
misdemeanor
offences
involved
in
this
case,
section
7207
or
7203
are
potentially
applicable
to
income
tax
violations.
the
issue
in
the
case
as
we
see
it,
is
whether
this
is
a
proper
case
for
lesser
included
offence
instructions,
we
submit
that
it
is
not
a
proper
case
but
we
do
not
take
issue
with
the
general
proposition
that
lesser
offence
instructions
are
proper
in
income
tax
cases.
they
are
in
proper
cases.
they
are
not
in
this
case
because
of
the
fact
that
lesser
offence
instructions
are
only
proper
under
long
course
of
decisions,
going
back
at
least
to
1891,
when
there
is
some
factual
issue
distinguishing
the
greater
and
the
lesser
offence
that
is
where
the
jury
could
as
petitioner
in
his
brief
case
concedes,
whether
jury
could
rationally
acquit
the
defendant
of
the
greater
offence
but
convict
him
of
the
lesser.
if
that's
true
then
we
concede
that
in
this
case
there
should
have
been
a
lesser
included
defense
instruction
on
any
misdemeanor
as
to
which
that
was
true.
we
do
submit
that
that
was
not
true
in
this
case
because
under
the
evidence
in
this
case
it
was
rationally
the
impossible
for
jury
to
acquit
the
defendant
of
the
felony
charge
while
they
convicted
him
of
either
one
of
the
misdemeanors.
now
i
-–
mr.
paul
bender
yes
mr.
justice,
that
i
think
is
the
crucial
difference
between
us
brought
out
by
mr.
justice
white's
question
at
the
end
of
the
argument.
petitioner
seems
to
say
that
you
do
not
violate
section
7201,
if
you
have
some
intention
at
the
time
you
file
a
false
return
to
pay
at
a
later
time,
that
is
a
man
willfully,
fraudulently
understates
his
income.
in
this
case,
he
understated
his
income
by
more
than
$20000,
willfully,
fraudulently
understates
his
income
on
a
return
and
submits
the
return
--
we
say
and
the
cases
hold,
that
when
he
does
that,
that
is
the
completed
offence
of
the
income
tax
evasion,
there
is
nothing
ease
to
show.
petitioner
seems
to
say
that
it's
a
defense
in
a
case
like
that
if
he
can
convince
the
jury,
that
in
his
mind,
it
was
the
intention
some
time
in
the
future,
5
years,
10
years,
he
doesn't
say
how
long
in
the
future.
some
time
in
the
future
to
make
this
good,
i
am
not
quite
sure
what
petitioner
argues
would
make
this
fraud
good
whether
he
would
go
back
and
reopen
the
57
return,
file
an
amended
return
same
5
years
ago,
i
defrauded
the
government.
now
i
wish
to
come
clean
and
say
that
i
withheld
$20,000
income
whether
its
that
or
whether
he
would
simply
add
the
income
to
later
year,
i
don't
think
it
to
be
the
latter
because
that
would
clearly
be
innovation
of
the
assessment
of
the
tax
on
the
57
return.
in
any
case,
we
say
that's
clearly
wrong,
you
do
not
show
a
defense
to
a
prosecution
for
evasion
by
showing
that
you
intended
to
pay
in
a
later
year.
if
that
were
true
for
example,
suppose
5
years
after
the
filling
of
the
fraudulent
return,
the
taxpayer
changes
his
mind
and
decides,
well,
he
is
gotten
away
with
the
5
years,
he
now
intends
never
to
pay,
when
has
he
committed
evasion
at
any
time
certainly
on
petitioner's
theory,
he
didn't
commit
evasion
when
he
filed
a
return
because
at
that
time
he
intended
that
somewhere
it
would
come
in
the
future
pay.
i
don't
think,
he
would
convince
and
commit
the
offensive
evasion
when
he
changed
his
intention
because
he
would
at
that
time
commit
no
overt
act
and
the
law
i
think
is
clear
that
in
order
to
commit
evasion,
you
have
to
commit
it
overt
act.
another
problem
which
would
be
raised
aside
from
the
problem
of
cheating
the
government,
another
problem
which
would
be
raised,
it
would
be
a
problem
of
how
the
statutory
limitations
would
apply
to
that
theory
but
the
statute
in
this
offence
is
six
years.
suppose,
for
6
years
the
taxpayer
keeps
in
mind,
this
vague
intention
to
pay,
at
the
end
of
6
years
he
changes
his
mind,
he
no
longer
ever
intendeds
to
pay,
the
statute
at
run
on
the
over
act,
the
statute
runs
from
the
time
of
the
overt
act,
we
would
never
be
able
to
prosecute.
we
submit
that
it
is
simply
impossible
to
read
the
statute
for
those
reasons
and
on
the
plain
face
of
the
statute
which
–-
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
there
are
such
cases
that
fairly
rare.
mr.
paul
bender
not
at
all
mr.
justice,
we
concede
that
there
are
appropriate
cases.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
that
was
the
issue
in
this
case
–-
mr.
paul
bender
but
surely
the
whole
issue
at
trial
was
whether
he
knew
that
he
was
filing
a
false
return.
he
stated
at
trial
that
he
honestly
--
mr.
paul
bender
well,
that
is
an
issue
which
petitioner
has
injected
into
this
case.
only
in
this
court
i
have
been
arguing
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
that
issue
is
before
the
court,
i
don't
think
it
is
--
mr.
paul
bender
no,
there
might
be
cases
where
the
indictment
charges
that
--
mr.
paul
bender
we'll
we
would
allow
the
lesser
included
offense
instructions
even
in
some
cases
where
the
indictment
charge
is
an
intent
to
evade
and
defeat
for
it
--
mr.
paul
bender
well,
for
example
suppose
that
the
indictment
charges
and
the
proof
--
the
proof
is
in
some
--
suppose
there
are
two
false
statements
alleged
in
the
return,
one
is
a
statement
with
regard
to
the
source
of
the
income,
the
other
is
the
statement
with
regard
to
the
amount
of
the
income.
we
charge
that
the
statement
with
regard
to
amount
was
false
and
that
of
course
was
an
attempt
to
evade.
suppose
the
proof
raises
some
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
statement
with
regard
to
amount
is
true
but
it's
fairly
clear
from
the
proof
that
the
statement
with
regard
to
source
is
false.
in
a
case
like
that,
a
lesser-included
offense
instructions
on
7207
without
proper
(voice
overlap)
mr.
paul
bender
that
there
would
might
be
a
failure
proof
of
evasion
but
there
wouldn't
be
a
failure
proof
on
a
false
material
statement,
for
example,
the
statement
as
to
the
source
of
the
income,
so
you
could
have
an
improper
case
in
an
instruction
under
7207,
you
could
also
have
an
improper
case
instruction
under
7203,
for
example
the
indictment
might
charge
you
–
mr.
paul
bender
well
–-
mr.
paul
bender
it's
a
false
section
7207.
mr.
paul
bender
but
the
source
of
the
income
is
[voice
overlap]
mr.
paul
bender
well
in
checking
return
and
in
checking
on
with
other
tax
payers
who
have
taken
improper
deductions
or
have
reported
their
income
properly,
it's
important
to
know
that
the
source
of
the
income
is.
mr.
paul
bender
like
for
example
take
the
case
mr.
justice
where
a
man
in
a
black
market,
illegal
operation,
where
he
is
paying
too
much
for
materials
and
he
is
selling
at
over-ceiling
price
deliberately
under-states
both
his
deductions
and
his
incomes,
so
it
all
washed
that
alright,
and
he
is
not
understating
his
income
but
he
deliberately
falsifies
the
total
amount
of
his
gross
income
and
falsifies
the
total
amount
of
his
deductions
--
mr.
paul
bender
well
he
would
be
liable
not
only,
i
think,
under
7207
but
also
under
provision
of
the
criminal
court
for
making
a
false
statement
to
the
government
mr.
paul
bender
well
i
think
it
has
two
reasons.
mr.
paul
bender
for
the
reasons
i
gave,
i
think
the
source
of
revenue
is
material
in
the
tax
scheme
because
we
do
check
--
as
between
tax
payers
to
make
sure
that
their
returns
jive
and
if
he
misstates
the
source,
it
messes
up
that
entire
scheme.
we
do
not
[voice
overlap]
mr.
paul
bender
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
not
authorized
prosecutions
under
7207
because
these
cases
are
so
rare,
i
think
they
are
potentially
applicable.
i
think
7207
is
potentially
applicable
and
7203
also
is
--
for
that
reason
we
submit,
the
entire
question
in
this
case
is
whether,
on
facts
of
this
case,
that
jury
could
rationally
believe
that
the
petitioner
was
innocent
of
the
7201
offence
and
was
guilty
of
either
the
7207
offence
or
the
7203
offence.
mr.
paul
bender
in
this
case,
i
can't
see
any
factors
which
would
have
to
be
added.
if
the
charged
means
of
evasion
is
the
filing
of
a
false
return
as
in
this
case,
then,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
a
way
of
getting
a
lesser
offense
instruction.
it
would
have
to
be
some
other
means
of
evasion
alleged
aside
from
the
filing
of
a
false
return.
it's
our
submission
that
if
you
do
deliberately
file
a
false
return,
deliberately,
fraudulently
understating
your
income,
that
constitutes
an
evasion
of
tax.
so
when
the
offense
charged
is
the
filing
of
the
fraudulent
return,
so
long
as,
excuse
me,
so
long
as
the
--
the
fraud
concerns
the
amount
of
the
income,
as
i
tried
to
say
before
there
might
be
fraud,
material
fraud
in
a
return
which
would
not
concern
the
amount
of
the
income.
in
such
a
case,
if
that
was
one
of
the
charges
and
if
that
was
part
of
the
proof,
then,
a
lesser-included
offense
instruction
on
section
7207
wouldn't
be
proper.
mr.
paul
bender
not
were
the
only
fraud
allege
is
as
to
the
amount.
if
the
only
fraud
allege
is
as
to
the
amount
of
the
income,
then
we
submit
that
if
he's
guilty
at
all,
he
is
guilty
of
the
felony
and
if
he's
not
guilty
of
the
felony,
he
is
not
guilty
of
the
misdemeanors
and
that
simply
is
because,
take
this
case,
if
he
isn't
guilty
of
the
felony,
that
means
that
he
didn't
do
it
willfully
and
fraudulently
and
if
he
didn't
do
it
willfully
and
fraudulently
then
he
is
not
guilty
of
7207.
mr.
paul
bender
this
i
think
is
the
same
question
mr.
justice
stewart
was
asking.
the
only
way,
there
are
two
ways
i
can
say.
one
is
if
the
falseness
does
not
–-
mr.
paul
bender
no,
it
is
not,
not
according
to
our
–-
we
do
not
prosecute.
if
the
falseness
concerns
the
amount
of
the
income,
we
do
not
prosecute
on
the
7207,
we
only
prosecute
under
the
evasion
provision.
we
deem
that
to
be
the
intent
of
the
legislature
in
the
54
code
and
in
the
39
code,
as
reflected
in
this
court's
decisions
in
the
kelly
case.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
that
wasn't
always
true,
but
we
feel
that
it
is
true
now.
even
any
doubts
that
might
have
been
true
under
39
code
are
cleared
up
by
the
plain
congressional
intension
in
the
54
code
revision,
that
all
evasions
be
treated
uniformly.
mr.
paul
bender
false
filings
as
to
amount
of
income,
false
filings
which
reduce
the
tax
liability.
there
may
as
i
suggest
mr.
justice
stewart
de-false
filings
which
would
not
concern
the
amount
of
tax
liability,
which
would
not
the
evasions,
they
would
be
misdemeanors.
mr.
paul
bender
not
in
my
knowledge.
mr.
paul
bender
not
in
my
knowledge.
there
is
one
other
possible
way
of
violating
7207
without
violating
7201
and
that
would
be
if
in
--
suppose
the
taxpayer
files
a
false
return
which
understates
the
amount
of
income
deliberately,
at
the
same
time,
he
also
understates
deductions
which
he
has
but
he
doesn't
realize
that
he
has
the
deductions.
the
consequence
is
that
there
is
no
tax
deficiency.
and
we
would
take
the
position
in
that
case
that
he
would
be
violating
7207.
he's
made
a
material
false
statement,
even
though
there
is
no
deficiency
in
that
one
evasion.
the
position
of
the
government
is
that
fraud
in
a
tax
return
is
a
very
serious
thing.
the
penalties
under
7207
–-
mr.
paul
bender
well,
i
suggest
that
in
the
–
in
the
tax
statutes
fraud
means
more
than
that.
it
means
making
a
deliberate
fraudulent
false
statement.
mr.
paul
bender
not
necessarily.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
i
don't
think
it
only
--
one
possible
meaning,
perhaps
the
common
law
meaning,
but
i
think
a
deliberately
false
statement
on
a
tax
return
is
serious
enough
matter
to
the
prosecute
under
misdemeanor.
the
penalties
under
7201,
the
–-
mr.
paul
bender
we
do
not
-–
we
have
not
prosecuted
under
7207.
mr.
paul
bender
i
don't
know
of
any
such
prosecution,
no.
now
under
the
--
under
the
facts
here
as
i
think
i
have
shown,
you
cannot
have
since
the
understatement,
was
an
understatement
of
the
amount
of
income.
if
that
understatement
was
willful
and
deliberate,
you
cannot
have
that
without
having
the
felony
of
tax
evasion
and
if
you
don't
have
that,
if
you
don't
have
a
willful
understatement
of
income
in
this
case,
you
don't
have
the
misdemeanors
of
7207.
now
this
argument
proceeds
on
the
basis
that
you're
not
entitled,
the
defendant
is
not
entitled
to
a
lesser
offense
instruction
unless
he
can
show
some
factual
issues
differentiating
the
felony
from
the
misdemeanor.
i
state
that
as
something
that
the
petitioner
and
the
government
agree
on
in
this
case,
i
would
be
happy
to
argue
that
proposition
if
the
court
feels
there
is
any
doubt
about
it
but
i
would
like
to
proceed
the
rest
of
my
argument
on
the
basis
that,
that
is
the
law
as
to
lesser
offense
instruction.
mr.
paul
bender
a
directive
verdict?
mr.
paul
bender
well,
we
say
there
is
no
factual
issue
before
the
jury
in
this
case
which
distinguishes
7203
or
7207
from
7201,
the
facts
to
show
those
three
offenses
in
this
case
are
precisely
the
same.
mr.
paul
bender
oh
yes!
and
there
is
no
question
as
to
–-
mr.
paul
bender
but
that's
--
mr.
paul
bender
that
would
not
constitute
a
defense
to
7201
prosecution.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
that
would
not.
the
same
affidavit
says
that
i
knew
i
should
have
reported
the
57
sales.
now
if
he
knew
he
should
have
reported
the
sale
and
did
not,
that
constitutes
the
felony
of
tax
evasion.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
if
they
believe
that,
if
they
believe
that
statement
they
would
have
to
believe
it,
he
intended
to
evade,
it's
the
evasion
as
to,
justice
black,
not
of
the
payment
of
the
tax
but
the
evasion
of
the
assessment
of
the
tax.
that
is
a
separate
offense
which
is
completed
as
soon
as
one
attempts
to
evade
the
assessment
of
the
tax.
now
the
tax
is
assessed
on
the
basis
of
the
tax
return,
if
you
file
a
false
tax
return
which
understates
your
tax
liability
that
is
an
evasion
of
the
assessment
of
the
tax
because
the
assessment
is
too
low.
mr.
paul
bender
the
difference
it
makes
it
a
felony
in
7201
is
the
attempt
to
evade
tax
liability
-–
mr.
paul
bender
--
that
you
get
away
with
taxes,
you
pay
less
than
you
should.
mr.
paul
bender
no
he
would
attempt
to
evade
the
assessment
of
the
proper
tax
liability,
he
plainly
did
that,
he
said
he
would
pay
in
a
later
year
but
that
doesn't
negate
the
fact
that
he
attempted
to
evade
the
proper
assessment
in
1957.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
the
charge
is
the
attempt
to
evade
the
assessment
of
the
tax
at
the
time
it
should
have
been
properly
assessed.
it
should
have
been
properly
assessed
in
1957.
mr.
paul
bender
the
indictment
charges
him
with
attempting
to
evade
and
defeat
taxes,
we
not
the
payment
of
taxes
but
taxes.
the
statute
clearly
distinguishes
between
two
things,
one
is
the
attempt
to
evade
and
defeat
the
payment
of
taxes
which
we
concede
he
would
not
have
done
here
if
he
intended
to
pay
later.
the
other
is
the
attempt
to
evade
or
defeat
any
tax,
now
that
means
government
has
always
taken
the
position,
that
means
in
this
court
has
said
that
means
the
attempt
to
evade
the
assessment
of
income
tax
as
lawn
against
the
united
states
355
us,
states
that,
that
is
the
offense
described
by
7201,
the
attempt
to
evade
the
assessment
of
tax.
mr.
paul
bender
of
7207?
mr.
paul
bender
7203
is
easy,
you're
guilty
of
the
misdemeanor
of
7203
if
you
simply
omit
to
file
any
tax
return
whatsoever.
mr.
paul
bender
it
doesn't
make
the
distinction,
it
charges
--
the
charges
that
would
knowingly
attempt
to
evade
and
defeat
a
large
part
of
the
income
tax.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
i
think
it
is
in
the
brief
mr.
justice
brennan
on
page
--
mr.
paul
bender
no,
the
indictment
charges
in
with
willfully
and
knowingly
attempting
to
evade
and
defeat
a
large
part
of
the
income
tax.
now,
we
suggest
that
charges,
the
attempt
to
defeat
and
evade
the
assessment
of
the
tax.
lawn
against
the
united
states,
holds
that
is
an
offense,
we
believe
that,
that
is
an
offense,
it
should
be
an
offense
for
the
reasons
i
gave
you
before,
because
if
you
define
the
offense,
as
only
being
the
attempt
to
evade
the
payment
of
tax
that
would
mean
that
it
would
be
the
offense
to
the
prosecution
that
the
defendant
had
in
his
mind
the
intention
to
pay
sometime
in
future.
would
that
mean
that
the
government
would
had
to
prove
in
every
case,
would
have
the
burden
of
proving
in
every
case
that
the
defendant
really
did
not
intend
to
pay
it
a
future
time.
mr.
paul
bender
well
--
mr.
paul
bender
well,
surely.
mr.
paul
bender
well
there
is
an
issue
left
to
the
jury
in
this
case
and
that
is
whether
he
did
it
willfully,
whether
he
knew
that
he
should
have
reported
this
income
on
the
return.
mr.
paul
bender
well
he
said,
at
a
trial
he
did
not
know
that,
the
trial
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
argued
that
he
thought
that
he
was
under
no
obligation
to
report
this
income
because
of
these
repairs
which
he
had
to
make
on
a
creek
in
land
adjoining
the
land
that
he
sold,
that's
a
fairly
incredible
defense
when
you
think
of
that.
mr.
paul
bender
they
did
have
the
right
to
pass
on
it
in
this
case
but
precisely
what
the
charges
that
the
jury
asked
them
to
pass.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
no
the
charge
which
was
actually
given
to
the
jury,
told
them
that
if
they
believe
the
defendant's
story,
that
he
honestly
believed
he
did
not
have
to
report
this
income
because
of
the
repairs
he
might
have
to
make
on
the
adjoining
land
then
they
should
acquit
it.
mr.
paul
bender
that
instruction
was
refused
because
we
submit
--
that
instruction
did
not
put
to
the
jury
any
factual
issue
upon
which
they
could
have
acquitted
the
defendant
of
7201
and
convicted
him
under
7207,
the
instruction
itself
mr.
justice,
doesn't
point
to
any
factual
issue,
it
simply
says
if
you
find
him
not
guilty
of
7201
then
you
may
find
him
guilty
of
7207
or
7203.
instruction
however
does
not
point
to
any
fact
in
this
case
upon
which
the
jury
could
have
made
that
distinction
and
we
submit
that
there
is
no
fact
in
this
case
in
which
the
jury
could
have
made
that
distinction
except
on
the
petitioner's
theory
that
you
are
not
guilty
of
tax
evasion
if
you
intend
to
pay
at
a
future
time
and
that
just
isn't
proved.
mr.
paul
bender
you
would
be
guilty
of
the
misdemeanor.
mr.
paul
bender
if
petitioner's
theory
were
correct
but
petitioner's
theory
is
not
correct.
mr.
paul
bender
well
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
also
guilty
of
the
misdemeanor
of
filing
a
false
return
as
to
the
material
matter.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
paul
bender
and
he
wouldn't
be
guilty
of
any
sir.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
no
that's
too
hypothetical
i
don't
see
i
mean
--
mr.
paul
bender
in
this
case
correct.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
therefore
i
say
that's
true
i
suppose
you're
right
and
the
only
way
you
could
have
given
the
included
offense
instruction
here
it
would
be
if
there
was
a
way
rationally
not
to
convict
to
the
felony
but
thought
to
convict
to
the
included
offenses
and
that's
just
wasn't
possible
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
bender
why
did
congress
give
him?
the
congressional
policy
is
not
entirely
clear
as
to
why
7207
is
presently
in
the
court.
mr.
paul
bender
yes
and
i
suggest
that
how
they
are
reconcilable
i
think
--.
mr.
paul
bender
7201
applies
where
there
is
an
evasion
of
tax,
the
assessment
of
tax
and
payment
of
tax.
that
applies
where
there
is
a
willful
act
which
leads
to
the
evasion
of
the
proper
tax
to
be
assessed
or
paid.
7207
applies
where
there
is
a
fraudulent
statement
which
is
material,
but
which
does
not
lead
to
the
lowering
of
tax
liability.
mr.
paul
bender
as
the
7203,
the
same
analysis
applies,
in
this
case
the
a
7203
would
only
apply
under
the
theory
that
he
has
not
paid
his
tax
not
in
this,
the
only
way
which
he
has
not
paid
his
tax
in
this
case
was
to
understate
his
tax
liability.
if
he
did
that
willfully
he
committed
the
felony.
if
he
didn't
do
that
willfully
he
didn't
commit
the
felony
and
he
also
didn't
violate
7203,
because
7203
only
implies
when
there
is
a
willful
failure
to
pay
the
tax.
for
those
reasons,
we
submit
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
because
there
is
no
factual
difference
between
the
instructions,
because
instructions,
if
the
petitioner
requested
the
court
to
get
to
the
jury,
it
shows
no
factual
way
which
the
jury
could
rationally
have
acquitted
the
defendant
of
the
felony
and
convicted
him
for
the
misdemeanor.
the
instructions
were
properly
refused
here.
mr.
paul
bender
he
certainly
confessed
to
the
misdemeanor
because
he
testified
that
he
knew
these
sales,
i
made
these
sales,
this
is
all
true
and
intentionally
let
them
off
of
my
tax.
