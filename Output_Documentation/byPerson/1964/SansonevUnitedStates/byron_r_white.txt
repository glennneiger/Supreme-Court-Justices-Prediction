justice
byron
r.
white
on
this
indictment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
this
--
what
was
charged
here
was
filing
a
false
return
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
lesser
included
defense
you
speak
of
would
require
knowingly
--
knowingly
–
justice
byron
r.
white
but
which
--
the
lesser
included
defense
of
filing
a
false
return,
what
is
that
7207?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
7207
requires
when
you
file
the
false
return
that
you
know
it's
false.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
it
cannot
ever
be
held
to
the
anything
less
than
intending
your
evade
–
justice
byron
r.
white
if
a
jury
-–
if
a
jury
would
find
that
you
knowingly
file
a
false
return,
is
that
--
wouldn't
it
necessarily
also
find
an
intentional
evade?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
are
those
different?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
know
--
when
you
know
the
form
you
have
made
out
to
sign,
it's
false
and
you
file
it.
now
that
is
--
how
is
that
different
from
intending
to
evade?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
understand
that
but
how
is
that
different
from--
passing
and
returning
those
false.
justice
byron
r.
white
overstating
his
income
presented.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
the
intent
to
evade
means
if
you
intend
never
to
pay
and
if
you're
going
to
away
with
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
never
enough
of
an
intent
for
7201
just
not
to
pay
this
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
can
never
-–
i
can
never
be
guilty
of
a
felony
as
long
as
i
show
that
i
attended
to
pay
my
tax
sometime.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
my
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
my
very
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
really
convince
a
jury
that
you
didn't
have
an
intent
to
evade
if
you
knowingly
filed
a
false
return.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
ask
you
what
if
he
didn't
believe,
one
of
the
jury
didn't
believe
that
he
knew
the
filing
was
false,
he
wouldn't
be
guilty
in
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
take
it
your
point
is
that
if
the
included
offense
instruction
was
proper,
was
justified,
what
he
really
should
have
done
is
dismiss
the
case,
not
send
it
to
the
jury
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
why
you're
saying,
if
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
felony,
there
is
no
evidence
would
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
we
have
heard
a
lot
and
i
don't
know
the
right
court
yet
after
this
--
why
did
congress
–
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
–
you
are
just
talking
about
reconcile.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
pay
that
how
many
--
justice
byron
r.
white
just
a
question
when
you
intend
to
pay
the
tax?
when
you
intend
to
cheat
the
government
either
cheat
it
this
year
or
next
year?
and
that
depends
on
whether
it
is
a
felony
or
misdemeanor,
if
you
intend
to
cheat
it
next
year
it's
a
felony,
intend
to
cheat
it
this
year
it's
a
misdemeanor.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
you
would
use
all
kind
of
--
over
crossing
the
same
percentage
without
going
to
pay
to
government
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see
none.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
the
way
they
ask
before
and
i'll
pay
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
--
distinguish
between
the
willfulness
of
7201
and
7207,
that's
just
the
only
way
--
it's
just
the
time
--
it's
just
the
--
whether
you
intended
or
not
to
pay
or
intend
to
postpone.
that's
the
only
way
you
distinguish
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
ever
asked
that
be
on
this
particular
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
ever
request
that
if
this
submitted
on
this
particular
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
i
understand,
i
understand
that
it
was
the
point,
it
was
this
point
raised,
this
particular
distinctions
between
7201
and
7207
that
you
now
rely
on
ever
offered
in
the
trial
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
this
was
an
--
that
this
---
it's
just
been
---
that
this
is
a
rather
recent
thought.
