justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
was
that
the
only
issue,
really
at
the
trial
or
his
motivation
in
doing
this?
honesty
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
it
was
willfully
or
mistakenly,
but
honestly
done
at
that
point.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
justice,
because
each
one
of
them
are
somewhat
different
ingredients
–
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
hear
that
he
knew
this
–-
this
was
false
--
would
that
make
any
difference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
he
knew
it
was
false?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
been
argued
here,
i
think
he
has
been
arguing
about
it,
whether
he
might
have
known
it
was
false
but
he
might
have
intended
to
pay
some.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
that
your
argument
though
would
cover
every
case,
not
just
this
case
but
every
case,
where
the
indictment
charges,
a
vocal
attempt
to
evade
and
defeat
by
failing
to
pay.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
the
words
evade
and
defeat,
were
not
here
then
i
gather
your
argument
would
allow
the
lesser
instruction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
example?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
the
failure
proof
on
evasion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
different
case
but
i
[voice
overlap]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
the
government
--
decides
to
prosecute
-–
let
me
ask
it
this
way.
when
could
you
convict
for
a
7207
false
filing,
knowingly
false
filing
and
could
not
convict
for
a
7201,
knowing
false
filing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
up
to
the
government
whether
they
want
to
convict
him
for
a
misdemeanor
or
a
felony
for
the
very
same
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
always
thought
a
fraud
that
as
getting
money
or
other
property
away
from
somebody
else
by
false
pretences.
that's
not
a
very
artistic
definition
but
that's
basically
what
it
means
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
are
the
indictment
charges
in
it?
