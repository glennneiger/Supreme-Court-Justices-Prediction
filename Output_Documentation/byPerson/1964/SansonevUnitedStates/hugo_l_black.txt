justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
what
is
to
be
given?
that's
all
about
the
privilege
saying
directive
verdict
on
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why?
in
other
words
the
evidence
by
this
man,
as
you
said
a
reason
prior
he
didn't
intended
cheat
the
government
and
the
judge
take
that
issue
away
from
the
jury
by
just
refusing
to
charge
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
brief
indicates
that
you
did
make
claim
in
reference
to
something
that
this
affidavit
get
before
the
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
said
that
he
told
you
burden
of
the
number
of
financial
obligations,
did
not
feel
he
get
raised
to
money
to
pay
any
tax
due
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
his
intent
in
report
all
clear
for
the
future.
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
not
constituted
defense
but
by
not
constituted
reason
for
saying
he
did
not
intend
to
cheat
instead
evaded
taxes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
unless
you're
not,
but
if
you're
only
charging
him
with
attempting
willfully
to
evade,
why
wouldn't
that
raise
an
issue
in
jury's
mind
and
but
i
wish
to
say
we
–
well
we
don't
think
it's
in
provision.(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
the
congress
has
for
some
unaccountable
reason,
i
don't'
know
why,
that
two
statutes
here
under
pay
which
are
very
vague
effect
of
what
they
mean,
one
of
them
is
a
felony.
what
is
the
difference
that
makes
it
a
felony?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
pay
less
than
you
should,
but
he
said
he
didn't
intend
to
do
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then
he
attempted
to
evade
paying
it
at
the
exact
time
it
was
due,
is
that
the
charge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
otherwise
section
-–
statutes
then
--
whoever
just
be
guilty
of
a
misdemeanors.
justice
hugo
l.
black
7207
or
7203.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
you
have
some
affect
to
it
but
i
don't
know
what
it
is
as
i
have
never
known.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
always
intended
to
leave
something
to
the
jury
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
--
establishing
between
the
two.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
not
the
charge.
he
knew
that
he
could
report
it
at
that
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
but
if
it
is
a
defense
in
all,
then
the
jury
have
the
right
to
pass
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
charge
was
refused.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
your
brief,
they
said
and
you
showed
the
request
for
the
instruction,
which
was
refused.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
would
be
a
misdemeanor
and
it
worth
a
felony
or
not.
just
to
go
that
far,
even
taking
what
he
says
of
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
did
you
put
an
reliance
on(inaudible)
against
united
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
what
ways?
justice
hugo
l.
black
be
a
felony.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
it
only
has
to
be
a
willful
omission
to
make
a
return
or
offense
to
that
kind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
but
they
accept
the
governmental
brief
