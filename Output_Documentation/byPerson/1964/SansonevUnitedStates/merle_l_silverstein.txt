mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
involves
a
criminal
prosecution
for
the
felony
of
income
tax
evasion.
but
the
court
below,
the
petitioner
was
indicted
in
two
counts
for
the
years
1956
and
1957.
he
was
acquitted
as
to
the
1956
count
but
convicted
as
to
the
1957
count.
the
district
court
then
assessed
punishment
as
15
months
imprisonment
and
a
$2000
fine.
now
the
sole
question
presented
here
on
this
appeal
is
whether
or
not
the
jury
should
have
been
given
lesser
offence
instructions.
this
would
have
given
them
the
alternative
of
convicting
the
defendant
on
a
misdemeanor
under
section
7203
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
is
the
section
which
makes
it
a
misdemeanor
to
willfully
fail
to
pay
a
tax
when
do
and
also
the
failure
to
give
the
jury
a
lesser
offense
instruction
under
rule
--
under
section
7207
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
makes
a
misdemeanor
for
any
person
willfully
to
file
a
false
return.
these
instructions
were
both
specifically
requested
by
the
defense
below
and
they
were
refused
by
the
district
court,
that
action
was
affirmed
by
the
eighth
circuit
certiorari
of
course
was
sought
and
granted.
we
feel
of
course
that
in
order
to
consider
this
question,
there
should
be
some
fearful
consideration
to
the
facts
involved
in
the
case.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
omitted
income
which
was
the
basis
of
the
indictment
involved
only
a
single
capital
gain
transaction
in
each
of
the
two
years
in
question.
briefly
in
march
of
1956,
the
tax
payer
purchased
a
large
track
of
land
for
$20,000.
he
merely
sold
a
small
piece
of
that
track
for
$22,500.
then
the
following
year,
he
sold
another
small
piece
of
a
large
track
for
$27,000.
neither
of
these
two
transactions
were
reported
on
his
1956
and
1957
returns.
now
none
of
these
facts
were
disputed
at
the
trial.
that
was
freely
conceded
by
the
defense
that
these
sales
were
made
and
that
these
sales
were
not
reported
on
either
return.
but
the
sole
issue
that
was
contested
at
the
trial
below
was
that
of
the
tax
payer’s
intent.
the
only
evidence
the
government
had
to
prove
intent
was
a
statement
which
the
tax
payer
gave
to
a
special
agent
of
the
intelligence
unit
in
may
of
1960
about
two
years
after
the
1957
return
had
been
filed.
in
this
statement
the
tax
payer
admitted
all
of
the
facts
and
questions
that
the
income
--
that
the
sales
were,
that
they
were
not
put
in
his
return
and
that
he
intentionally
omitted
them
from
his
return
and
then
the
statement
concludes
in
regards
to
the
1957
return
with
this,
i
knew
i
should
have
reported
the
1957
sale
but
my
wife
did
not
know
that
it
should
have
been
reported.
it
was
not
my
intention
to
evade
the
payment
of
our
proper
taxes
and
i
intended
to
pay
any
additional
taxes
due
when
i
was
financially
able
to
do
so.
this
was
the
–-
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
it
was
a
joint
return
but
only
–-
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
she
was
not
indicted.
now
the
record
is
absolutely
devoid
of
any
other
evidence
of
intent.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
even
the
eighth
circuit
conceded
in
its
opinion,
all
of
the
other
evidence
showed
just
the
opposite,
it
showed
a
lack
of
any
intent
to
evade
and
a
complete
absence
of
any
of
the
badges
of
fraud.
some
of
the
items
which
the
eighth
circuit
highlighted
were
for
example,
there
was
no
attempt
made
in
these
real
estate
transactions
to
use
straw
parties
of
false
names.
the
defendant
dealt
in
his
own
name
at
all
times.
secondly,
the
payments
for
these
transactions
were
always
by
check,
mr.
sansone
took
checks
in
his
own
name
endorsed
them
and
deposited
them
in
his
own
regular
bank
account.
thirdly,
the
proper
documentary
stamps
were
fixed
to
the
deeds,
properly
and
truthfully
showing
the
purchase
prices
which
were
paid
which
mr.
sansone
received
for
these
properties.
fourth,
all
deeds
were
properly
recorded
giving
notice
to
the
entire
world
and
fifthly,
there
was
no
consistent
pattern
of
under-reporting
of
income.
outside
of
these
two
isolated
transactions
mr.
sansone’s
returns
had
been
correct
in
all
details.
now
this
was
the
government's
case.
the
defense
revolved
chiefly
around
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
himself
and
as
i
say
he
admitted
that
he
made
these
sales
and
did
not
put
them
in
his
return,
the
reason
he
gave
was
that
he
anticipated
huge
capital
expenditures
on
this
property.
he
told
the
jury
and
this
was
corroborated
by
expert
testimony
from
an
architect,
from
an
engineer
and
from
the
mayor
of
the
city
in
which
the
property
was
located.
but
he
told
the
court
and
the
jury
that
there
was
a
stream
running
through
his
property
called
fish
pack
creek
and
this
creek
was
creating
a
serious
health
and
safety
hazards
that
it
was
constantly
over-flowing
with
sewage
and
all
sorts
of
other
things
and
that
they
had
told
mr.
sansone
that
he
must
fix
this
creek
immediately
after
the
state
highway
commission
of
missouri
had
resolved
its
problems
in
connection
with
the
adjacent
street.
mr.
sansone
had
estimates
that
the
minimum
cost
for
fixing
his
creek
would
be
$40,000
but
he
couldn't
start
and
he
couldn't
get
a
final
estimate
until
the
adjacent
highway
of
course,
had
been
altered
in
accordance
with
the
plans
of
the
missouri
highway
commission
and
so
based
on
these
facts
the
defendant
below
testified
that
he
honestly
believed
that
he
did
not
have
to
report
any
capital
gain
until
he
had
ascertained
what
these
additional
costs
were
going
to
be
and
then
he
could
compute
based
on
these
two
sales
made
whether
or
not
he
had
a
gain
to
report
or
not.
now
it
was
considered
by
everybody
and
of
course
we
here
conceded
this
was
not
a
proper
evaluation
of
the
tax
law
by
the
defendant.
it
was
a
mistake,
it
was
conceded
at
the
trial
that
it
was
a
mistake,
but
it
was
the
defense
of
the
trial
below
that
this
was
an
honest
mistake
that,
whereas
the
tax
payer
did
intentionally
omit
these
things
from
his
return,
did
intentionally
fail
to
make
these
capital
gain
reports
in
his
return.
it
was
not
--
it
did
not
arise
out
of
any
tax
evasion
motive.
it
arose
strictly
out
of
his
mistaken
interpretation
of
my
client.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
it
would
have
amounted
i
believe
to
about
$4000
dollars
to
the
year
$5000
to
the
year
in
question
because
of
the
capital
gain
there
were
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
mr.
justice
harlan
there
was
considerable
controversy
of
the
trial
and
the
experts
from
the
government
had
difficulty
in
deciding
which
formulae
should
we
use
for
ascertaining
the
basis
for
the
little
piece
that
he
sold
off,
should
we
use
the
front
footage
or
the
area
or
the
allocation
of
cost
never
really
came
out
in
black
and
white.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
that
is
correct.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
no,
he
said
that
--
he
admitted
that
he
signed
the
statement,
but
he
said
the
statement
weren't
--
was
not
his
words,
it
was
his
statement
that
was--
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
right,
it
was
a
statement
that
was
drawn
up
by
the
agent
that
he
signed
because
he
was
told
that
we'll
exculpate
his
wife
and
he
was
concerned.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
right
and
he
also
said
that
he
was
assured
that
this
was
only
an
initial
step
and
he
would
have
a
chance
to
discuss
the
whole
thing
at
the
appellant
level
later
on.
but
he
did
repudiate
the
confession;
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
no
your
honor,
no
the
government
of
course
did
not
concede
that
--
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
it
was
conceded
by
the
--
it
was
conceded
by
the
defense
that
that
he
did
not
--
that
his
interpretation
of
a
law
was
a
mistake,
in
other
words
the
defense
admitted
that
the
defendant
was
wrong
in
that
return
--
in
not
making
his
returns.
the
government
did
not
concede
it
was
a
result
of
mistake
of
course
their
contention
was
a
result
of
fraud.
now
based
on
these
facts
the
lesser
offense
instructions
under
7203
and
7207
were
offered
and
refused
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
his
intent
was
the
only
issue
that
is
correct.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
i
think
that
it
was
virtually
conceded
the
trial
that
it
was
willful
not
accidental,
but
the
question
was
whether
or
not
it
was
done
with
an
intent
to
defeat
and
abate
taxes,
that
was
the
issue.
i
think
at
the
outset,
that
we
ought
to
consider,
please
the
court
briefly
the
general
rules
which
govern
lesser
included
offense
instructions
under
rule
31
(c)
of
the
federal
rules.
now
the
solicitor
concedes
in
his
brief
that
in
connection
with
criminal
prosecutions
generally,
although
for
some
unknown
reason
not
income
tax
prosecutions
that
a
lesser
offense
instruction
is
required
if
two
criteria
are
met,
first
of
all
the
lesser
offense
for
which
you're
seeking
the
instruction
must
be
included
in
the
greater
offence
which
is
charged
and
secondly,
the
evidence
must
justify
the
lesser
offence
that
is
to
say
there
must
be
some
substantial
conflict
concerning
the
aggravating
elements
and
we
use
aggravating
element
of
course,
to
mean
that
element
which
when
added
to
the
lesser
offence
escalates
it
to
the
greater
offence.
now
the
solicitor
concedes
this
that
this
should
apply
generally
to
criminal
prosecutions.
if
for
some
reason
unsupported
by
the
authorities,
the
solicitor
apparently
takes
the
very
bold
position
that
this
should
not
apply
to
income
tax
prosecutions.
he
argues
in
his
brief
that
when
the
government
makes
a
charge
of
a
felony
under
section
7201
which
is
the
tax
evasion
statute,
when
they
make
the
charge
and
when
they
make
their
prima
facie
proof
at
the
trial
that
then
they
are
entitled
to
go
to
the
jury
on
section
7201
only
and
nothing
less.
in
other
words
as
we
take
it
the
government
is
simply
saying
that
rule
31
(c)
for
some
reason
doesn't
apply
to
income
tax
prosecutions
and
to
the
jury
and
an
income
tax
evasion
case
should
never
have
the
alternative
of
perhaps
disbelieving
part
of
the
government's
prima
facie
proof,
believing
some
of
it,
but
perhaps
disbelieving
some
of
it
and
finding
the
defendant
guilty
of
one
of
one
of
the
lesser
included
misdemeanors
instead
of
the
felony.
they
offer
no
authority
for
this
position
except
to
say
that
it
is
consistent
with
the
prosecutorial
policy
of
the
department
of
justice
to
treat
all
alleged
evasion
cases
as
7201
felonies
only
and
apparently
the
department
does
not
consider
7203
and
7207
as
available
statutes
under
which
to
prosecute,
if
they
have
any
evidence
whatsoever
of
a
possible
evasion.
now
it
appears
that
the
department
is
seeking
to
get
this
court's
blessings
to
their
prosecutorial
policy
and
are
asking
this
court
to
hold
that
once
they
charge
under
7201
a
tax
evasion
and
once
they
make
prima
facie
proof
then
that's
it,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
lesser
offenses
and
they're
entitled
to
a
conviction
and
to
go
the
jury
under
7201
and
nothing
less.
well,
we
simply
can't
see
any
justification
in
logic,
precedent,
legislative
history
or
what
have
you
to
uphold
this
position
by
the
government.
rule
31
(c)
as
far
as
we
can
tell
is
a
codification
and
reiteration
of
the
common
law
and
it
was
intended
to
apply
to
all
criminal
prosecutions.
apparently,
there
is
some
move
afoot
in
the
solicitor's
office
to
set
income
tax
evasion
cases
apart
from
other
prosecutions.
i
happened
to
be
in
the
courtroom
yesterday
and
heard
the
argument
in
the
jabon
case
where
the
solicitor
argued
that
complaints
are
different
for
income
tax
evasions.
they
should
have
different
requirement
than
complaints
another
criminal
prosecutions.
now
in
this
case,
they're
urging
a
different
rule
in
regard
to
lesser
included
offenses.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
silverstein.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
it
is
conceivable
that
they
could
have
your
honor.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
no,
sir.
no
sir.
7203
and
7207
cover
two
different
acts.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
we
contend
they
are
both
lesser-included
in
the
7201
felony
and
it
could
have
been
conceivable
for
the
jury
to
find
him
guilty
of
both
misdemeanors
and
not
guilty.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
that's
correct,
your
honor.
now,
we
simply
contend
that
income
tax
evasion
should
be
different
from
no
other
criminal
prosecutions
and
if
a
tax
evasion
charge
necessarily
includes
lesser
offences
as
this
court
held
it
does
include
in
the
spies
case
specifically
held
that
it
included
lesser
offences.
they
should
be
treated
no
differently
than
any
other
federal
crime
and
rule
31c
should
be
held
to
apply.
now,
to
this
extent,
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
that
once
a
jury
has
convicted
a
defendant
of
income
tax
evasion,
of
income
tax
evasion
and
there
and
have
rejected
of
course
any
lesser
offences,
then
section
7201
is
the
only
statute
which
should
apply
and
prescribe
the
penalties.
we
are
making
no
content
that
there
is
an
overlap
and
that
a
tax
evasion
conviction
should
be
governed
by
some
misdemeanor
statute
to
the
overlap
that
was
suggested
to
the
court
in
achilli's
case,
we
are
not
making
that
contention.
if
the
jury
makes
a
finding
of
guilty,
of
tax
evasion
and
they
have
rejected
any
possibility
of
lesser
offences,
then
of
course
7201
is
the
only
section
we
should
apply
and
we
should
prescribe
the
penalty.
but,
we
say
just
as
in
any
other
law,
this
does
not
preclude
the
possibility
of
there
being
lesser
offences
and
does
not
preclude
the
necessity
for
when
the
evidence
indicates
it
for
instructions
on
those
lesser
offences
to
be
given.
now,
in
regards
to
this
specific
instruction
was
the
first
one
that
was
requested
was
under
7207.
this
as
i
noted
before
is
a
provision
which
makes
it
a
misdemeanor
to
willfully
file
a
false
tax
return.
it
does
not
require
any
intent
to
defeat
or
evade
tax
as
it
merely
requires
that
the
false
return
be
willfully
filed.
significantly,
a
statutory
predecessor
which
was
3616
a
of
the
1939
code
did
require
an
intent
to
defeat
and
evade.
but,
when
the
court
was
rewritten
in
1954
code
and
substituted
section
7207
replaced
3616
a
and
it
simply
requires
willfully
filing
a
false
return
to
constitute
the
misdemeanors.
it
specifically
eliminated
the
phrase
dealing
with
the
intent
to
evade.
the
eight
circuits
in
affirming
this
case
simply
followed
its
previous
holding
in
manko
v
united
states,
that
section
7207
does
not
apply
to
income
tax
returns.
now,
the
solicitor
general
has
had
two
opportunities
to
support
this
opinion,
in
its
brief
opposing
certiorari
and
in
the
brief
on
the
merits
in
this
case.
in
both
instances,
the
solicitor
has
failed
to
do
this.
he
has
failed
to
support
the
eight
circuit
opinion
or
to
do
anything
to
attempt
to
justify
it.
we
take
his
silence
to
mean
that
the
solicitor
and
the
government
concede
that
section
7207
does
in
fact
apply
to
income
tax
returns
as
well
as
other
returns.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
no,
i
don't.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
we
only
requested
lesser
instructions
on
7203
and
7207.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
that's
correct.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
(voice
overlap)
--
the
instruction
essentially
said
for
example
on
7207
if
you
find
that
the
defendant
willfully
files
the
false
return.
but
if
you
find
that
he
did
not
have
the
intent
to
defeat
or
evade
then
you
will
find
him
guilty
of
a
lesser
offence
under
7207.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
what
is
the
third
–
what
is
the
third?
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
well
of
course,
there
would
be
a
question
of
double
jeopardy,
i
would
suppose,
so
because
some
of
the
elements
that
are,
for
example,
some
of
the
elements
that
are
necessary
to
7207
are
necessary
elements
to
7201.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
right,
you
add
a
couple
of
elements
to
7207,
then
you
have
7201.
it's
no
different
than
in
the
murder
case,
if
you
have
a
first-degree
murder
case,
you
normally
instruct
that
second-degree
murder
too.
if
you
don't
have
deliberation,
it's
second-degree
murder,
if
you
have
deliberation,
it's
first-degree
murder,
but
they
couldn't
be
found
guilty
in
both.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
except
–-
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
if
they
involve
different
ingredients
that's
correct,
but,
for
example,
in
this
indictment
7201,
one
of
the
essential
prerequisites
of
a
felony
charge
as
this
court
held
in
spies
was
some
affirmative
act
showing
a
willful
intent
to
evade
taxes.
now,
that
thing,
that
affirmative
act
in
this
case
was
the
filing
of
a
false
return.
so
the
filing
of
a
false
return,
a
misdemeanor
itself
was
also
a
portion
of
the
larger
charge,
so
they
could
not
find
him
guilty
of
both.
it
would,
in
my
opinion
be
included
as
double
jeopardy.
and
anyway,
we
feel
and
i
think
the
solicitor
will
probably
agree
in
view
of
his
prior
admissions
and
i
believe
in
his
petition
opposed
in
his
brief
opposing
certiorari
in
the
dillon
case,
they
conceded
that
7207
does
apply
to
income
tax
returns
and
i
feel
this
coupled
with
their
silence
as
to
the
eight
circuit
position
leaves
no
alternative
but
that
they
must
concede
that
it
does
apply
to
income
tax
returns.
and
this
is
not
an
issue
at
this
time.
and
what
the
government
does
contend
here
is
that
in
the
instant
case,
the
evidence
did
not
justify
giving
a
lesser-included
offense
instruction.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
conflict
as
to
this
aggravating
element.
and
in
urging
this
particular
point,
the
government
uses
a
very
interesting
play
on
words,
particularly
the
word
willfulness.
the
government's
claims
that
the
elements
of
the
section
7201
felony
are
first
a
tax
deficiency,
secondly,
some
affirmative
acts
constituting
an
attempted
evasion,
and
thirdly,
willfulness,
three
elements,
and
the
government
points
out
that
the
elements
of
these
7207
misdemeanor
are
two-fold,
one,
the
filing
of
a
false
return,
which
is
the
same
as
the
affirmative
act
in
the
felony,
and
secondly,
willfulness.
so
the
government
concludes
that
willfulness
is
required
in
both
the
felony
and
the
misdemeanor
and
willfulness
is
not
the
aggravating
element
which
can
escalate
the
misdemeanor
to
the
felony,
and
the
government
claims
that
the
tax
deficiency
is
the
thing
that
escalates
the
misdemeanor
to
the
felony.
now
that's
the
aggravating
element
between
7207
and
7201.
and
of
course
what
this
argument
neatly
assumes
is
the
word
willfulness,
they
assume
that
the
word
willfulness
means
the
same
thing
in
both
statutes
and
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth,
because
as
this
court
held
in
spies
case
unequivocally
and
of
course,
as
this
language
of
the
statute
clearly
expresses
the
term
as
willfulness
as
used
in
these
two
sections
mean
something
completely
different.
the
term
willfulness
as
used
in
the
felony
means
one
thing
a
specific
intent
to
defeat
or
evade
taxes.
nothing
less
than
that
will
suffice,
and
this
court
so
held
in
the
spies
case
and
reaffirmed
in
holland
versus
united
states
and
i
think
this
is
virtually
beyond
dispute,
but
in
regard
to
section
7207,
the
misdemeanor,
the
term
willfulness
simply
means
voluntarily,
purposely,
not
accidentally.
in
other
words,
as
it
was
pointed
out
in
speech,
willfulness
means
different
things
depending
on
the
context
in
which
it
is
used
and
you
just
have
to
look
at
the
statute
in
this
case
to
find
out
which
is
which.
so
in
this
instance,
for
a
felony,
you
must
have
an
intent
to
defeat
or
evade.
nothing
less
will
suffice
for
the
misdemeanor
of
course
you
only
have
to
have
willfulness
and
so
far
as
it
pertains
to
be
voluntary
and
not
accidental
character
of
filing
a
false
return.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
right.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
willfully
filling
a
false
return
between
statute.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
that's
correct.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
well
that's
correct.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
well
we
think
it
unquestionably
can.
a
man
can--
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
no.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
well
–-
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
an
indent
to
evade
or
an
intent
to
defeat
involves
a
specific
intent
to
cheat
the
government
on
a
permanent
basis.
in
other
words
–-
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
a
person
can
file
a
false
return
just
as
it
defend
and
they
did
in
this
case
--
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
well
that
would
be
an
example,
that
would
be
correct,
but
i'm
saying
in
this
instance
the
defendant
so
in
testimony,
if
filed
a
false
return,
he
knew
he
should
have
reported
the
fact
of
the
sale
even
if
there
wasn't
any
capital
gain.
he
knew
that
the
fact
of
the
sale
should
have
been
reported
on
his
return
and
he
did
not
report
it
on
his
return.
he
thought
that
he
could
wait
until
his
anticipated
expenses--
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
you
intend
to
right,
you
intend
never
to
pay
--
you
intend.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
that
is
correct
we
and
the
language
of
the
statute
–
the
attempt
to
defeat
and
evade,
there
is
a
specific
language
of
statutes
used
and
--
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
if
you
could
convince
a
jury
i
would
say
--
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
that's
correct.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
that's
correct.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
this
is
a
jury
question.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
this
was
my
great
question.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
this
is
a
jury
question
and
this
is
all
we
wanted
was
to
have
this
issue
submitted
to
the
jury.
did
this
man
intend
to
defeat
or
evade
or
did
he
just
intend
as
he
states
in
his
confession
that
the
government
used,
that
he
merely
intended
to
put
it
off
to
a
subsequent
year.
if
it's
a
just
a
same
as
the
larceny,
the
famous
larceny
of
the
motor
vehicle
case
as
that.
the
defendant
gets
on
the
stand
and
says
i
didn't
intend
to
keep
the
car,
i
was
only
going
out
joy
way.
so
under
that
type
of
testimony,
you
have
it
issued
that
he
intend
to
steal
it,
was
the
intent
to
permanently
deprive
the
owner
or
was
the
just
an
unlawful
use
of
a
motor
vehicle.
it
does
create
a
jury
question
which
the
jury
--
we
feel
the
defendants
entitled
had
the
jury
instructed
on.
so
we
feel
that
this
question
of
willfulness
to
please
the
court
is
unquestionably
the
distinction,
one
of
the
distinctions
between
the
felony
and
the
misdemeanor.
and
that
if
the
willfulness
amounts
to
an
intent
to
defeat
or
evade
then
the
crime
which
has
been
committed
is
a
felony.
if
the
willfulness
amounts
to
anything
less
than
that,
anything
less
than
an
intent
to
defeat
and
evade,
then
the
only
thing
that
the
defendant
has
committed
is
a
misdemeanor.
and
in
the
instant
case
you
just
have
to
look
at
the
confession
itself,
the
thing
that
government
relied
on
to
prove
intent
in
which
he
said
i
did
not
report
it
on
my
return,
i
did
not
intend
to
evade
my
taxes,
i
intended
to
pay
them
in
a
subsequent
year.
you
have
to
look
no
further
than
that
to
find
out
that
the
evidence
in
this
very
case,
literally
cried
out
for
the
lesser-included
offense
instructions
which
we
here
sought.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
the
trouble
with
the
government's
position
in
this
case,
if
it
please
the
court
is
that
they
equate
in
an
intent
to
postpone
or
delay
with
an
intent
to
defeat
or
evade.
we
can
find
nothing
in
the
dictionary
of
the
english
language
or
the
cases
to
justify
this
type
of
equality.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
it
goes
beyond
that.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
that's
correct.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
that's
right.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
absolutely
not.
the
reason
and
the
reason
in
making
that
statement
is
that
the
offence
is
completed
as
soon
as
you
put
the
false
return
in
a
mail.
now
we
said
yes,
some
offense
is
completed
when
you
put
a
false
return
in
the
mail,
or
send
it
to
the
government,
but
what
that
offense
is
depends
on
what
your
intent
was
when
you
put
the
false
return
into
mail.
did
you
have
an
intent
to
defeat
or
evade
then
you're
a
felony.
if
you
have
an
intent
only
to
postpone
or
delay
then
the
most
you
could
be
would
be
a
misdemeanor,
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
if
it
was
intent
to
postpone
or
delay
i
don't
believe
there
would
be
an
intent
to
cheat
at
least
on
affirmative
basis.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
well
i'm
not
saying
we
should
give
him
a
mail,
but
he
still
guilty
of
a
crime
mr.
justice
white
but
the
crime
is
not--
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
to
have
the
dignity
of
felony
in
that
case
it's
only
misdemeanor.
it's
still
a
crime
unquestionably,
but
is
if
there
was
no
intent
to
permanently
cheat
the
government
then
the
congress
only
intends
that
this
should
be
a
misdemeanor
--
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
we
do
your
honor
unquestionably.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
the
spies
case
in
the
first
place
holds
that
the
while
the
government
has
conceded
the
point
that
tax
evasion
felony
does
include
lesser
offenses,
but
more
important
the
spies
case
holds
specifically
that
the
thing
that
distinguishes
the
felony
from
the
misdemeanor
is
the
tax
evasion
intent.
there
must
be
an
attempt,
there
must
be
some
affirmative
act
which
manifests
an
intent
to
defeat
and
evade
taxes.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
right
and
this
is
not
necessary
for
the
misdemeanor.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
or
filing
some
willful
meeting
intentionally
and
not
accidentally
the
spies
case
holds
that
to
make
it
a
felony
the
intent
must
be
to
defeat
and
evade
the
taxes.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
in
this,
on
this
record
mr.
justice
white,
on
this
record,
this
would
be
the
issue.
i
would
say
that
there
could
be
other
distinctions
in
other
cases
but
in
this
record,
based
on
the
petitioner's
testimony
below,
the
issue
that
should
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury
by
these
lesser
offence
instructions
was
--
was
he
has
intentions.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
it
was.
the
instruction
was
specifically
offered
under
7203
and
7207,
were
refused
by
the
trial
court
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
instructions
were
offered.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
yeah,
you
mean
in
the
form
of
instruction
or
in
the
form
of
evidence
--
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
absolutely
not,
the
petitioner's
testimony,
his
own
testimony
in
the
trial
was
based
on
this
whole
theory.
i
would
say
that
when
the
petitioner
himself
testified
below
he
virtually
confessed
to
7207
prosecution.
he
said
that
he
left
this
thing
off
his
return,
and
he
did
it
intentionally.
he
thought,
through
a
mistake,
mistaken
interpretation
of
law,
could
wait
till
he
his
other
cost
to
ascertain
the
–
but
he
virtually
confessed
to
7207
violation
and
but
denied
of
course
an
intent
to
defeat
or
evade.
this
is
why
we
think
that
lesser
offense
instruction
was
essential.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
right.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
he
refutes
an
intent
to
defeat
or
evade,
he
admits
a
willfulness
in
filing
a
false
return.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
i
know
because
federal
rule
31c
authorizes
this
--
this
rule
is
not
one
just
made
for
defendant,
it's
made
for
the
government's
preference
too.
31c
says
you
can
be
convicted
of
the
offense
charged
or
of
any
lesser
offence
included
in
the
offence
charged.
this
is
nothing
new
or
strange
for
it's
been
in
the
law
for
hundreds
of
years,
just
the
same
way.
it's
just
like
a
first
degree
murder
charge.
as
any
man
charged
indictment
of
the
first
degree
murder
can
always
be
convicted
of
second
degree
murder,
man
slaughter
with
the
indictment.
that's
always
saying
here
in
so
far
--
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
that's
correct,
unless
it's
included
in
the
offence.now
we
--
i
have
not
spent
any
time
here
because
it's
adequately
covered
in
our
brief
and
the
government
concedes
it
and
that
is
affected
that
these
two
lesser
offences
are
unquestionably
included
in
this
particular
charge.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
no.
we
ask
for
the
lesser
included
--
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
i
don't
know
if
we
would
have
been
entitled
to
the
additional
instruction
because
the
court
already
gave
the
usual
instruction
and
if
you
found
that
he
did
not
intend
to
defeat
or
evade,
he
should
acquit.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
i
think
we
would
be
entitled
to
an
instruction
but
it
was
not
duplicitous
that
if
he
intended
to
pay
this
in
a
later
year,
only
intended
to
postpone
and
delay
then
he
should
acquit
as
to
the
felony.
i
think
we
would
entitled
--
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
they
made
their
prima-facie
case
when
they
introduced
their
confession
in
their
evidence,
and
i
would
say
from
then
on
it's
the
matter
of
the
defense
to
rebut
their
prima-facie
case
and
negate
the
intent
or
the
presumption
of
intent
that
they
proved.
mr.
merle
l.
silverstein
that's
right
because
the
burden
never
switches
--
that's
true.
but
i
say,
the
government
met
their
burden,
at
least
prima-facie,
then
of
course
we
have
the
burden
of
going
forward
with
the
evidence
charge,
we
thought
it.
