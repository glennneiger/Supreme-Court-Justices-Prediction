justice
potter
stewart
he
did
at
the
trial
--
petitioner
did
but
deny
making
the
statement
to
the
agent
to
which
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
he
never
made
it
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
reflect
what
he
had
actually
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
that
was
his
motivation
to
exculpate.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
silverstein,
its
your
theory
that
silverstein
or
silverstine?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
your
theory
that
the
jury
constructed
the
way
you
say
should
have
been
instructed
could
have
found
the
petitioner
guilty
of
both
7203
and
7207?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
don't
graduate
these
in
three
steps.
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
separate
acts.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
were
right,
you
would
concede
at
least
as
you
now
see
that
the
jury
could
have
found
it
7203
and
7207.
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
ask
you,
excuse
me
for
interrupting,
i
don't
need
answer
now
but
under
your
theory
if
the
jury
has
been
instructed
--
about
these
other
two
sections
but
they
have
found
the
petitioner
guilty
of
all
three.
justice
potter
stewart
these
three,
each
one
of
the
three
involves
a
separate,
different
ingredients.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
the
instructions
which
you
requested
which
i
am
not
looking
at
now
would
have
told
the
jury
that
if
they
found
him
them
guilty
of
7203
and
7207,
they
could
not
find
him
guilty
of
7201
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
maybe
otherwise
if
they
didn't
find
guilty
of
7201.
justice
potter
stewart
but
why
now
that
i
have
interrupted
you,
why
i
couldn't
even
have
been
found
guilty
for
all
three,
each
one
involves
separate.
justice
potter
stewart
7207,
7203,
7201.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that's
true
and
if
–
if
that's
the
right
analogy
but
in
narcotics
offences,
for
example,
from
the
same
--
we
often
get
three
or
four
separate
convictions
for
possession,
for
sale,
for
purchase.
justice
potter
stewart
although
i
can
really
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
leave
this
comes
quite
a
surprise
to
me
that
the
government
itself
could
prosecute
a
person
that
he
fully
paid
his
taxes,
fully
reported
all
his
income,
but
said
that
some
that
came
from
the
x
company
instead
of
the
when
it
actually
came
from
the
y
company,
you
mean
to
say
to
send
a
person
to
prison
for
that?
justice
potter
stewart
he
fully
reported
all
his
income,
he
paid
all
his
taxes
off
--
[voice
overlap]
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
government
care?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
in
the
liability
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
well
it
may
be
important
administratively
but
do
--
is
that
a
criminal
violation?
justice
potter
stewart
in
case
you
gave
an
answer
to
my
brother
douglas
that
means
that
i
say
–
that
do
get
the---
that
the
person
could
be
criminally
liable
and
reports
all
his
income,
pays
all
the
tax
on
it,
merely
because
he
said
that
some
came
from
dividends
from
general
motors
when
actually
it
was
an
us
steel.
justice
potter
stewart
material,
is
that
material?
justice
potter
stewart
government
is
raising
revenue
–
rising
--
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
a
little
administrative
inconvenience
but
i
may
–
i
will
tell
you
that.
justice
potter
stewart
that
wasn't
always
true,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
all
for
all
knowing
false
filings
should
be
–-
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
to
your
knowledge
has
an
indictment
error
or
has
a
prosecution
error
taken
place
where
there
was
no
allegation
of
any
tax
deficiency,
a
criminal
prosecution
for
tax
evasion?
justice
potter
stewart
or
for
any
violation
of
any
of
these
statutes
and
there's
no
allegation
at
all
at
any
time
of
that
they
defendant
owed
any
tax?
justice
potter
stewart
cheating
somebody
-–
that's
something
for
somebody
else
by
-–
by
decedent,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
suppose
you
know
there
never
has
been
a
prosecution.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
ever
been
a
prosecution
under
any
criminal
statute
to
your
knowledge
when
there
was
no
allegation
at
all
but
the
defendant
owed
any
tax?
justice
potter
stewart
it
goes
beyond
that,
they
just
say
7207
doesn't
apply
where
the
charge
is
by
mistaking
the
assessment,
or
that
the
amount
only
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
only
rather
a
misstatement
as
to
the
saying
the
source
from
which
the
income
comes.
justice
potter
stewart
can
we
accept
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well
,
mr.
silverstein,
if
we
are
talking
about
his
testimony
in
the
trial,
i
should
think
if
that
have
believed
he
would
have
been
guilty
of
anything.
because
he
said
he
didn't
think
owed
and
tax
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
because
that
he
anticipated
heavy
expenses
right
be
in
the
light
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
understand
it
that
way.
if
you
are
right
--
might
there
not
be
some
problem
about
indictments,
in
these
cases,
an
indictment
to
be
good
has
to
inform
the
defender
that
what
he
is
charged
with,
and
if
any
indictment
only
mentioned
7201
then
he
had
to
convict
into
something
else.
you
have
a
problem
there,
which
you
–-
justice
potter
stewart
but
generally
speaking
it's
good
deal
of
body
of
law
that
says
you
can't
be
convicted
for
something
under
indictment.
