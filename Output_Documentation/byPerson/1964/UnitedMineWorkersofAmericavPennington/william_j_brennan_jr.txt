and
if
they've
been
organized?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
--
in
this
very
case,
if
the
so-called
wage
standards
in
the
case
of
a
union
which
owns
a
substantial
part,
one
of
the
larger
producers.
it's
not
conceivable
with
the
wage
standard
so-called
just
be
a
facade
for
a
conspiracy
to
monopolize
the
business
for
the
large
producers
including
the
two
in
which
the
union
has
such
as
standard
method?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you're
--
you're
suggesting
that
even
the
case
i've
put
to
you,
if
in
fact
it's
a
wage
standard,
although,
it
may
be
used
as
a
facade
by
the
union
to
improve
the
profits
of
the
company
in
which
it
entered,
it's
still
a
wage
standard
therefore
outside
the
sherman
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
it.
it's
not
wage
standard
that
might
satisfy
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
this
instruction
can't
be
read
as
saying
this
may
not
be
a
wage
standard
in
the
context
of
these
facts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
was
--
what
did
it
say?
was
this
written?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
get
to
that,
have
you
any
comments
to
make
argument
at
the
afl-cio
into
that
provision
of
the
charge
of
1556
a?
