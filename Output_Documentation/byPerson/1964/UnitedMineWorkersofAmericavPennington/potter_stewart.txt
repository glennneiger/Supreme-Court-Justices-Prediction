i'm
not
familiar
with
that
which
is
west
and
which
is
east?
justice
potter
stewart
these
involve
the
market
for
the
spot
market
for
steam
generating
coal?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
low
cost
coal,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
very
low
price
coal
rather.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
claim
is
that
west
kentucky's
bid
were
so
low
that
it
made
an
impossible
for
anybody
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
you're
right
about
that
and
also
right
about
the
fact
that
the
evidence
is
completely
clear
and
uncontradicted
that
that
union
had
no
voice
at
all
in
the
management
of
west
kentucky
then
whenever
was
kentucky
did,
i
suppose
that
it's
irrelevant
to
this
--
to
this?
justice
potter
stewart
should
it
govern
a
multi-employer
bargaining,
i
suppose
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
is
very
widespread
in
many
industries
that
perhaps
said
in
absent
agreement
among
employers
to
pay
their
employees
the
same
price
and
in
the
same
working
condition.
justice
potter
stewart
in
what
page?
justice
potter
stewart
sherman
act
as
interpreted
by
this
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
because
the
--
you
would
agree
i
suppose
that
the
literal
words
of
the
sherman
act
--
justice
potter
stewart
without
all
labor
unions.
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
told
us
i
think
that
this
might
sometimes
be
a
difficult
question?
justice
potter
stewart
on
which
you
might
have
to
rely
on
history
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
a
--
in
other
words
an
agreement
which
provided
all
plants
in
the
whole
industry
should
be
open
no
more
than
four
hours
a
day
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
would
require
--
would
require
some
investigation
to
see
whether
not
it
was
--
had
nothing
to
do
with
condition
of
employment?
justice
potter
stewart
also
the
carpenters
case,
particularly
the
carpenters
case?
