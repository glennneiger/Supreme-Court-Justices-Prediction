mr.
john
a.
rowntree
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
counsel
for
our
united
mine
workers
has
gone
somewhat
into
facts.
i
don't
want
to
get
bump
down
into
the
facts
at
this
time.
i
want
to
get
straight
on
the
theory
and
the
law
in
this
case
before
we
get
into
facts.
there
are
a
mass
detail
of
facts
in
this
case
and
we
can't
extract
these
items
here
and
there,
and
present
a
fair
picture
of
the
facts.
i
beg
to
the
court
that
i
read
our
synopsis
of
the
facts,
if
i
don't
get
in
to
any
substantial
statement
of
them
in
the
appendix
to
our
main
brief.
we
have
two
appendices
there,
on
the
facts,
and
if
they
can't
be
brought
down
to
12
pages.
is
it
took
us
some
70
or
80
to
bore
them
down
to
what
wanted
to
show.
now
as
we
see
this
situation,
we've
got
to
get
straight
on
what
the
theories
are,
in
the
two
cases
before
the
court.
as
i
understand
it,
the
jewel
tea
case
that
follows
this
one
has
one
theory
that
is
not
applicable
to
this
case.
as
i
understand
that
theory,
it
is
this,
that
the
sherman,
that
the
interlacing
sherman,
clayton,
norris-laguardia
acts
may
prevent
a
labor
union
from
imposing
market
restraints
on
the
face
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
areas
that
may
not
be
within
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
as
defined
in
the
labor
law.
where
there
is
no
combination
and
conspiracy
to
aid
business
groups.
our
case
is
the
allen
bradley
case
and
this
area
deals
with
an
area
in
which
that
sherman
act
has
primary
concern,
business
groups
monopolizing
and
restraining
trade.
we
allege
in
this
case
that
the
united
mine
workers
combined
with
business
groups
with
an
understanding
and
purpose
to
aid
those
businesses
to
restrain
trade
and
monopolize.
now,
we
consider
that
our
very
important
part
of
this
charge,
we
made
against
the
union
had
to
do
with
the
understanding
and
purpose
to
aid
business
groups.
i
think
that
that
is
the
point
where
all
of
these
briefs
filed
with
the
court
in
these
two
cases,
take
off
and
go
in
all
different
directions.
it
seem
inconsistent
to
us,
for
us
to
come
in
and
talk
about
a
combination
or
conspiracy
under
the
sherman
act
to
aid
business
groups
without
producing
some
purpose
or
a
proof
that
the
jury
could
find
an
understanding
in
purpose
to
aid
of
those
business
groups.
i
think
the
allen
bradley
case
is
a
good
example.
in
that
case,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
fundamental
difference
between
the
two
dissenting
justices
and
the
majority
of
the
court
is
that
the
two
dissenting
justices
could
not
infer
a
purpose
and
an
understanding
on
the
part
of
the
union
that
it
was
aiding
business
groups
to
restrain
trade
and
monopolize
because
the
union
was
the
aggressor
in
bringing
about
the
whole
arrangement
with
the
business
group,
obviously
for
the
purpose
of
increasing
wages,
improving
job
hire-opportunities,
increasing
membership,
and
that
was
what
the
whole
situation
was
about.
and
mr.
justice
murphy
in
his
dissenting
opinion
stated,
what
is
legal
if
done
alone
should
not
become
illegal
if
done
with
the
assistance
of
others
with
the
same
purpose
in
mind,
with
the
same
purpose
in
mind.
mr.
justice
murphy
could
not
get
over
this
fact
that
the
union
was
seeking
to
aid
itself
and
he
could
not
infer
any
additional
purpose
to
aid
the
employer
group.
now,
the
majority
of
the
court
did
infer
this
additional
purpose
to
aid
the
employer
group.
the
majority
opinion
states,
the
purpose
of
mutual
help
can
hardly
be
thought
to
cover
the
purpose
of
employer
help
in
controlling
markets
and
prices.
so
the
purpose
had
a
great
to
deal
to
do
this
with
this
and
this
was
not
a
purpose
that
the
majority
found
from
direct
evidences
such
a
purpose.
the
union
did
not
come
in
and
testify,
“yes,
we
had
a
purpose
and
understanding
to
aid
the
business
group
to
retrain
trade
and
monopolize,”
certainly
not.
but
that
purpose
was
inferred
from
the
course
of
conduct
under
which
the
markets
were
tied
up
in
the
obvious
advantage
of
the
business
group
and
that's
the
whole
crux
of
that
case
as
i
see.
there
must
be
an
inference
in
these
cases
from
circumstantial
proof
of
the
course
of
conduct
or
from
direct
evidence
which
you
can
ever
find
that
there
was
a
purpose
from
these
activities
which
was
strictly
labor
activities
to
aid
the
business
group
to
restrain
trade
and
monopolize.
now,
the
various
briefs
filed
with
the
court
in
these
two
cases,
some
of
them
state
that
there
ought
to
be
some
sort
of
objective
test
in
these
cases.
based
upon
the
expressed
language
in
the
bargaining
agreement,
we
suggest
that
that's
not
only
contrary
to
the
purport
of
the
allen
bradley
case
but
it
is
completely
foreign
to
sherman
act
combination
and
conspiracy
law.
the
american
tobacco
company
case
328
u.s.
is
an
example
that
it
is
not
the
form
of
the
combination
or
conspiracy
or
the
particular
mean
used.but
it
is
the
result
to
be
attained
under
the
understanding
and
purposes
of
the
conspirators
that
the
sherman
act
condemns.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
no,
sir.
because
you
can
never
infer
the
most
simple
facts
and
intend
to
aid
the
employer
group
to
restrain
trade
and
monopolize.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
i
submit,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
no,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
how
in
the
world
could
the
jury
find
a
purpose
and
--
intent
to
aid
the
employer
group
there
to
restrain
trade
and
monopolize?
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
again,
i
say
--
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
--
again,
i
say
your
honor
that
the
allen
bradley
situation
is
an
example
of
what
we're
talking
about.
i
say
that
you
can't
look
at
the
bare
language
of
any
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
say
there
is
a
combination
there
to
aid
employer
groups.
i
think
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
surrounding
circumstances.
the
whole
arrangement
between
the
union
and
the
bargaining
group
of
businesses,
the
background,
the
effect
on
markets,
the
effect
on
competitions,
the
whole
course
of
conduct
and
the
likelihood
of
any
other
group
to
determine
if
that
purpose
is
there.
was
there
a
purpose
and
understanding
on
the
part
of
this
union
that
it
was
aiding
business
groups
to
restrain
trade
and
monopolize?
that
is
what
the
sherman
act
is
after.
now,
as
we
construe
apex,
hutcheson,
and
allen
bradley,
there
must
be
this
particular
kind
of
purpose.
you
must
go
beyond
the
purpose
of
the
union
to
aid
itself
and
its
members
but
there
must
be
this
purpose
to
aid
the
business
group,
the
group
against
which
this
sherman
act
is
primarily
directed
to
restrain
trade
and
monopolize.
and
we
say
that
the
whole
arrangement
must
be
examined.
the
whole
course
of
conduct
in
that
situation
that
exists
to
determine
fact
--
purpose
is
present.
now,
this
is
the
only
way
that
we
can
see
at
this
area
of
the
law
can
be
kept
from
becoming
an
intricate
series
of
pigeonholes
and
categories
that
require
the
application
of
mechanics
rather
than
substance.
it's
the
only
way
to
keep
the
sherman
act
alive,
as
a
vital
and
instrument
to
promote
free
trade.
it's
the
kind
of
atmosphere
in
the
case
that
the
sherman
act
has
always
worked
well-in
in
the
past
and
this
is
the
way
we
approach
this
case.
this
is
the
way
we
understand
apex,
hutcheson,
and
allen
bradley.
now,
the
jury
in
this
case,
found
the
existence
of
the
conspiracy
as
we
charged
it.
before
the
trial,
we
set
forth
our
theory
of
conspiracy.
that's
contained
at
the
beginning
of
our
main
brief.
in
the
first
place,
we
say
that
there
is
proof,
direct
proof
in
part,
circumstantial
proof
from
courses
of
conduct
in
part
to
bear
out
every
phase
of
that
statement
of
conspiracy.
in
the
second
place,
we
say
that
any
labor
union
that
engages
in
that
kind
of
conspiracy
should
be
liable
under
the
existing
case
law
on
the
sherman
act.
now,
we
can
find
no
real
effort
on
the
part
of
opposing
counsel
to
come
to
grips
with
the
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
jury
verdict
in
the
light
of
the
proof
considered
as
a
whole.
every
effort
made
to
challenge
the
jury
verdict
consists
of
a
dismembering
of
the
body
of
the
proof.
and
as
we
understand
this
kind
of
case,
the
character
and
the
affect
of
a
conspiracy
are
to
be
judged
not
by
dismembering
the
proof
and
hearing
its
separate
parts
but
only
by
looking
at
it
as
a
whole.
the
duty
of
a
jury
was
to
look
at
the
whole
picture
and
from
this
viewpoint,
we
believe
it
is
manifested
the
jury
was
completely
reasonable
in
coming
to
its
conclusion
that
there
was
this
purpose
--
this
illicit
conspiracy.
indeed
much
of
the
whole
course
of
conduct
of
the
union,
its
testimony,
its
statements
of
officers,
its
investment
policy,
its
whole
course
of
conduct
cannot
be
explained
logically
in
the
face
of
any
other
conclusion.
the
proof
starts
off
with
the
united
mine
workers
openly
and
admittedly
proposing
to
step
beyond
the
bounds,
the
ordinary
bounds
of
the
labor
union
and
this
is
direct
proof,
important
statements
of
union
officers.
it
was
proposing
to
dictate
the
economics
of
the
industry,
to
impose
a
stabilization
of
production
and
price
plan
on
the
industry.
its
initial
program
was
to
use
the
working
time
of
the
men
to
accomplish
this,
to
offset
the
peaks
and
the
values
in
the
demand
for
coal
that
has
plagued
this
industry
for
decades.
now,
this
initial
program
was
contrary
the
interest
of
the
major
coal
companies.
the
big
mines
of
the
contrary
going
down
hill
in
the
competition
where
the
smaller
companies
that
came
in
during
the
war
and
the
post-war
years
of
the
1940's.
but
the
major
companies
did
not
want
this
large
expensive
mechanized
mines
standing
idle
for
substantial
period
of
time
during
the
work
week
under
the
union's
program.
so
there
was
a
hard
fight
over
this
issue
and
this
part
of
the
background.
this
fight
was
followed
in
1950
by
a
sudden
switch
in
the
concern
of
the
union
for
its
overall
membership.
there
was
a
certain
switch
in
the
concern
of
the
union
for
working
opportunities
for
all
of
its
members.
we
say
that
there
was
a
coming
to
terms
on
basic
issues
in
1950
between
the
union
and
the
major
coal
combines
of
the
country.
and
we
say
that
ever
since
that
time,
it
has
favored
the
major
coal
combines.
it
is
their
direct
proof
in
the
record
that
it
tailored
this
contract
to
fit
the
mechanical
techniques
of
major
coal
combines.
mine
coal
and
the
fixings
coal
with
the
gigantic
machinery
that's
coming
to
the
industry
in
the
past
15
years
leaving
an
in
past
for
the
small
companies
in
the
broad
fencing
scenarios
using
manpower
with
small
tools
and
machinery
to
keep
up
and
participate
in
the
industry's
production.
now,
market
control
has
been
a
clear
object
of
the
union.
this
concentration
on
the
market
side
--
on
the
economic
side
has
continued
it.
the
efforts
have
been
redoubled
in
culmination
with
these
major
coal
companies.
boycotts
have
been
put
in
the
face
of
the
contact.
the
union
says
it
doesn't
it
--
it
can't
be
responsible
for
all
of
these
uneconomic
units
of
the
industry
and
they
will
have
to
pass
out,
these
are
statements
in
the
record.
but
the
union
shows
us
clearly
it
knows,
it
acknowledges,
it
fully
anticipates
the
disastrous
results
that
have
come
about
which
are
coming
about
today
which
will
come
about
in
the
next
few
years
until
all
of
these
units
are
gone.
the
union
was
over
$100
million
in
his
treasury
invested
between
$25
and
$30
million
dollars
in
two
major
companies
operating
in
these
fix
seam
conditions
with
the
billion
tons
of
fix
seam
coal
the
mechanically
workable
seams.
the
union
has
contented
up
until
the
last
stages
of
the
trial.
but
those
were
mere
loans
but
it
ended
up
that
these
were
joint
enterprises
with
mr.
cyrus
eaton
and
certain
other
financial
gentleman,
under
joint
enterprise,
the
union
to
participate
to
over
52
--
50%
of
the
gains
and
the
profits
from
this
venture.
now,
we
had
to
fight
down
gradually
little
by
little
the
contentions
of
the
union
about
why
it
invested
that
much?
and
if
the
court
will
read
that
record,
the
synopsis
and
see
what
positions
the
union
took
originally
on
this?
and
how
we
--
how
we
to
beat
them
down
until
it
turned
out
that
would
be
making
it
so
that
they
could
make
profits?
and
they
expected
to
make
enormous
profits
from
this
investor,
from
this
enterprise.
there
was
control
over
those
companies.
the
union
had
its
representative,
made
chairman
of
the
board,
the
majority
of
the
board
and
it's
announced
in
the
1956
minutes
of
the
convention
of
the
union
when
mr.
eaton's
interest
bought
the
west
kentucky
coal
company.
his
first
official
act
was
to
instruct
that
company
to
execute
the
industry
agreement
with
the
united
mine
workers
of
america.
when
these
companies
went
out
and
were
used
as
fighting
ships
on
this
tva
spot
market,
it
was
the
union
that
went
and
got
this
loan.
it
put
up
$5
million
of
its
assets
as
a
pledge
to
carry
the
company
through
this
period.
the
present
accountant,
he
didn't
even
know
that
the
union
pledged
that
million
amount.
the
chairman
of
the
board
didn't
even
know
that
the
union
put
up
that
pledge
and
the
principal
officers
finally
admitted
that
they
expected
to
make
immense
profits
from
this
investment
in
the
major
coal
combine,
in
the
fixings
of
coal
using
the
machinery
and
these
companies
have
been
the
very
ones
that
had
wrecked
our
markets.
now,
the
proof
is
direct
and
conclusive
that
the
major
companies
and
the
union
were
not
going
to
allow
any
change
in
this
national
contract
that
would
make
it
practical
to
apply
in
the
thin
seam
areas
of
the
country.
the
union
and
the
dominant
coal
companies
fashioned
the
contract
that
requires
all
companies
to
pay
the
same
labor
cost,
regardless
of
the
productivity
of
the
individual
company
regardless
of
the
conditions
in
which
it
works.
now,
this
program
that
was
fashioned
for
the
industry
by
the
union
and
major
coal
companies
was
that
the
industry
as
a
whole
must
pay
the
labor.
its
increasing
share
in
this
enormously
arising
productivity
brought
about
by
the
great
machines.
but
those
companies
they
were
able
to
use
all
the
machines
in
their
conditions
do
not
have
to
pay
anymore
of
that
labor
share
than
does
a
company
that
has
to
use
manpower
with
smaller
tools
cannot
possibly
participate
in
this
increasing
productivity.
and
the
brief
for
bituminous
coal
operators
now
sets
to
tell
them
again
how
they
could
conduct
this
one
man
bargaining
sessions
with
the
union
so
as
to
lift
the
cloud
of
suspicion
from
those
sessions.
we
have
told
them
that
they
could
at
least
pay
their
pay
their
own
way
to
labor
on
this
greatly
increasing
productivity.
they
are
the
one's
that
are
enjoying
it
and
not
leave
it
up
to
these
small
companies
struggling
in
the
thin
seams
to
help
pay
their
way.
they
could
have
taken
out
of
that
contract
the
language
in
there
which
requires
the
united
mine
workers
to
impose
the
same
conditions
on
the
thin
seams
areas.
“during
the
period
of
this
contract
the
united
mine
workers
of
america
will
not
enter
into,
be
a

to
nor
will
it
permit
any
agreement
or
understanding
covering
any

or
other
conditions
of
work,
applicable
to
employees
covered
by
this
contract
on
any
basis
other
than
those
specified
in
this
contract.”
makes
it
in
fact
impossible
for
the
union
to
go
out
and
conduct
reasonable
bargaining
sessions
on
the
basis
that
the
companies
can
live
on.
the
major
companies
could
have
taken
out
of
these
national
contracts
the
boycotts
that
are
found
there
that
are
tied
up
the
thick
mechanically
workable
seams
of
coal
in
this
country.
in
which
it
barred
the
small
companies
from
participating
in
these
huge
long
term
contracts
for
coal
held
above
the
major
companies
that
have
covered
up
the
markets
for
coal.
now
it's
doubtful
--
it's
doubtful
for
any
other
industry
in
this
country
can
be
compared
to
the
bituminous
coal
industry
in
the
greatly
did
diverging
geological
engineering
production
problems
confronted
by
the
various
areas
of
the
industry
and
various
stores
of
communities
in
tennessee
that
had
been
tied
in
their
whole
economic
life
for
decades
to
the
mining
of
coal
out
of
these
conditions.
it
seems
less
than
four
feet
thick
that
make
up
77%
of
the
tennessee
field.
there
are
statistics
are
charts
in
this
record
giving
a
vivid
contrast
between
the
tennessee
southeast
kentucky
fields
and
all
the
fields
with
some
of
the
other
major
fields
of
the
country.
now,
the
machines
and
the
tools
that
can
be
used
in
these
conditions
cannot
be
compared
to
these
other
fields.
the
wages
that
the
company
can
pay
in
tennessee,
if
it
hopes
to
stay
alive,
and
the
wages
paid
by
our
clients
are
considerably
less
than
the
united
mine
workers
in
the
national
scale
that
imposes
down
on
us
the
fringe
benefits,
the
welfare
fund
payments,
but
these
are
good
wages.
they
are
the
best
wages
only
man
can
make
in
those
communities,
a
large
part
of
our
pledges
have
the
same
condition.
there
are
broad
areas
for
these
thin
seams
traditionally,
tied
to
those
conditions
and
these
areas
of
today
down
underneath
in
the
competition
with
the
area
more
favored
by
geology
and
terrain.
and
we
acknowledge
that
the
antitrust
laws
cannot
be
a
complete
answer
to
the
economic
guilds
of
these
people.
but
at
least
the
antitrust
laws
require
fair
play.
in
a
football
game,
the
man
is
down
piling
on
and
brings
on
a
penalty
to
antitrust
laws
penalize
those
that
use,
combine
their
economic
power
to
pile
on,
to
pull
a
competitor.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
this
is
the
protective
wage
clause,
the
same
as
sort
of
clause
that
it
was
in
the
company's
case
in
san
francisco
bay
area.
now
the
union
calls
it
a
subcontracting
clause
but
if
you
compare
the
clauses,
they're
exactly
the
same.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
the
union
contract
says?
yes
sir,
that's
written.
ah,
the
signatory
company
to
the
national
contract
will
not
buy
or
require
any
coal
mined
under
conditions.
it
won't
buy,
acquire,
or
deal
in
any
way
coal
mined
under
conditions
that
do
not
conform
to
the
terms
of
the
national
contract,
it's
exactly
as
the
carpenters
case,
protective
wage
clause.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
a
company
could
have
a
contract
--
could
have
--
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
well,
what
it
could
mean
is
a
company
that
does
not
have
a
contract
with
the
union
could
be
paying
higher
wages
and
it
could
though
sell
coal
under
these
terms,
these
literal
terms
but
a
company
might
have
a
contract
with
the
union.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
well,
it's
possible.
i
don't
know
how
to
coal
it
works.
it's
been
kicked
out
since
then.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
yes,
sir.
well,
the
labor
board
eliminated.
the
labor
board
knocked
it
out.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
they're
doing
the
best
they
can,
your
honor.
but
it's
still
part
of
--
much
further
down
in
national
average,
if
you'll
notice.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
which
--
which
page
are
you
reading?
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
yes,
sir.
the
record
goes
very
extensively
into
that.
now
tennessee
traditionally
had
the
larger
mines
on
the
railroad
temples
employing
great
numbers
of
men
using
small
tools
and
machinery.
these
mans
have
gone
out,
they've
been
knocked
out
during
the
course
of
this
conspiracy.
these
men
have
lost
their
jobs.
now,
thereafter
here
was
now,
opens
up
little
mines,
by
themselves.
many
of
them,
the
family
partnerships
and
those
are
what
mines
are
listed
there.
that's
where
the
grand
issue
is
coming
from.
now,
these
are
the
kinds
of
mines
that
the
union
was
trying
to
force
the
contract
on
as
tailored
effect
as
they
say
intense
mechanizationally
gigantic
machines.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
well,
that
goes
into
a
long
history
of
violence.
we've
got
a
war
going
on
there.
this
court
received
numerous
petitions
bearing
on
that
situation
and
it's
still
going
on.
and
we
think
that
proof
is
clear
that
there
has
been
this
conspiracy
to
combine
economy
power
to
pile
on
in
the
coal
business,
that
the
union
has
participated
in
that
not
for
the
advantage
of
its
broad
membership
but
to
the
advantage
of
these
great
combines
that
it
expects
to
take
over
the
industry
as
it
says.
because
between
1950
and
1960,
during
the
course
of
this
conspiracy,
two-thirds
of
the
men
have
been
driven
out
of
the
jobs
in
the
industry
where
the
union
has
organized
82%
of
the
industry
during
the
short
course
of
10
years,
65
%
of
the
manpower
has
been
put
out
in
the
industry.
and
get
this,
it
is
virtually
impossible
for
these
men
the
great
majority
being
union
members
to
find
another
employment
in
these
areas.
that
can't
be
denied
that
were
have
been
substantial
unemployment
anyway.
but
there
would
have
been
nothing
like
this
in
the
absence
of
umw
and
congress
policy
of
requiring
intensive
mechanization
even
where
that
is
impossible.
there
would
not
be
anything
like
this
amount
of
misery
and
destitution,
unemployment
if
they
were
not
this
plan
for
an
industry
prepared
by
handful
men,
powerful
men.
men
who
can
think
only
in
terms
of
what
is
to
the
advantage
in
the
major
coal
combine.
who
can
think
only
in
terms
of
domination
of
markets
and
industry
by
major
coal
combines,
that's
all
they
talk
about,
who
cannot
think
in
terms
of
the
misery
and
the
hardship
that
being
brought
about
in
this
country
in
broad
areas
from
the
rapid
development
of
their
plan
for
an
industry.
when
you
encounter
a
situation
like
this,
it
makes
you
think
that
the
great
rights
protected
in
the
constitution
turn
a
little
bit
pale
were
it
not
for
the
antitrust
laws
that
promote
free
trade
were
designed
to
prevent
this
tyrannical
concentration
and
use
of
economic
power.
the
bill
of
rights
is
reminded
to
public
officers
that
political
power
is
a
really
strong
thing
and
their
limits
beyond
which
is
not
safe
to
go.
the
antitrust
laws
are
reminded
to
those
who
hold
economic
power
that
their
limits
beyond
which
is
not
safe
to
go
and
we
submit
that
the
interlacing
sherman,
clayton,
and
norris-laguardia
act
limits
have
been
exceeding
in
the
facts
in
these
case.
the
jury
has
so
found,
the
court
of
appeals,
the
trial
court
has
sustained
that
verdict
with
the
utmost
of
deliberation.
now,
most
of
the
arguments
of
opposing
counsel
are
directed
at
contentions
other
than
the
reasonableness
of
the
jury
verdict.
and
these
contentions
are
generally
founded
on
the
idea
that
the
union
should
be
able
to
go
about
its
business
without
fear
challenge
with
the
sherman
act.
we
submit
that
that
law
was
settle
--
it
settled
in
a
only
way
it
could
have
been
settled
to
preserve
economic
freedom
and
to
prevent
the
devastating
trade
practices
and
monopolizations
that
the
appearance
of
which
brutalized
antitrust
law.
this
basic
economic
policy
of
the
country,
the
balancing
of
congressional
policy
found
in
the
labor
law
and
the
antitrust
law
was
worked
out
laboriously
by
this
court
in
apex,
hutcheson,
and
allen
bradley.
this
is
the
only
rule
that
we
can
see
that
can
work
and
make
sense.
if
a
union
combines
with
business
groups
to
do
the
very
thing
under
purpose
and
understanding
to
do
the
very
thing
which
the
sherman
act
was
primarily
designed
to
prevent,
business
groups
restraining
trade
monopolize,
the
union
as
well
as
the
business
groups
violates
the
sherman
act.
and
we
submit
to
that
rule
should
be
especially
true
where
the
union
is
not
only
a
union
but
because
of
investments
in
many
millions
of
dollars
in
the
industry
is
actually
one
of
the
business
groups
being
aided.
this
aspect
of
ownership
investment
in
the
industry
was
not
even
present
in
allen
bradley.
it's
not
considered
necessary
nor
was
it
present
in
the
carpenter's
case
or
from
san
francisco.
after
the
court
planned
the
writ
of
this
case,
the
afl-cio
counsel
asked
our
consent
to
there
filing
brief
as
amicus
curiea.
in
sending
back
our
consent,
we
asked
counsel
to
consider
seriously
whether
or
not
the
afl
organization
or
cio
organization
had
any
area
in
its
relationships
were
comparable
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
counsel
replied
that
this
was
a
hard
--
might
be
hard
case.
but
hard
cases
make
bad
law.
and
we
summit
that
the
law
in
this
case
was
settled
in
cases
that
did
not
involve
the
misery,
the
hardship,
unemployment
for
union
members,
and
broad
areas
that
these
case
involves.
the
afl
file
a
brief
relying
on
these
propositions
that
the
union
must
be
free
to
decide
for
itself
what
is
best
for
itself
and
its
members
without
fearing
the
sherman
act.
that
the
only
body
to
regulate
the
union
today
it
says,
is
the
nlrb
and
if
that's
particular
true,
it
says
since
the
taft-hartley.
i
filed
a
short
two-page
reference
to
the
taft-hartley
history.
we
have
found
a
reply
brief
to
the
afl
brief
with
particular
reference
to
the
legislative
history
of
taft-harley.
it
is
clear
that
in
the
first
and
second
years
after
this
court
decided
allen
bradley,
congress
gave
extensive
consideration
to
the
place
of
the
labor
union
under
the
antitrust
law
and
to
the
allen
bradley
rule
itself.
and
it's
most
clear
in
that
history
that
both
sides
of
congress,
the
minority,
the
majority,
and
the
president
of
united
states
himself
in
a
veto
message,
“all
concurring
the
allen
bradley
rule
is
necessary.
we
must
retain
it
in
a
law.”
congress
considered
the
wing
of
labor
policy
and
antitrust
policy
just
as
this
court
did
in
apex,
hutcheson
and
allen
bradley,
and
congress
decided
to
leave
that
law
just
as
this
court
left
it
no
decisions.
now,
as
we
understand
the
fundamental
basis
behind
the
allen
bradley
rule
if
the
courts
will
not
infer
a
repeal
of
antitrust
law
our
basic
economic
philosophy
without
declare
expression
of
congress.
now
in
--
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
by
this
court,
several
very
recent
ones.
applying
that
rule
with
a
particular
businesses,
organizations,
associations,
and
the
allen
bradley
rule
has
been
decided
--
cited
in
those
various
decisions.
now,
when
congress
has
considered
the
allen
bradley
rule
this
specific
decision
has
been
pointed
out
from
all
sides
that
there's
a
need
to
retain
that
rule
and
congress
does
not
change
the
law
there
can
be
no
inference
that
the
allen
bradley
rule
is
repealed
or
that
there
is
any
repeal
of
antitrust
law
altogether
with
respect
the
labor
unions.
so
we
say
that
decisions
in
allen
bradley
and
hutcheson
and
carpenters.
the
carpenters
case
was
decided
before
taft-hartley
too.
those
decisions
had
stood
the
test
of
time
and
the
thorough
appraisal
by
congress.
and
we
say,
that
the
inferences
of
illicit
purpose,
illicit
conspiracy,
in
this
case
are
far
stronger
than
the
inferences
that
were
raised
in
allen
bradley
and
the
carpenters.
all
three
cases
involve
the
union
combining
with
business
groups
putting
restraints
on
markets
that
favor
companies
in
certain
areas,
barring
companies
in
other
areas
from
those
markets.
in
the
allen
bradley
case,
the
restraints
arose
by
reason
of
geographical
limitations
only
participating
union
as
to
why
it
would
so
limit
the
geographical
limitation
on
the
union.
in
the
carpenters
case,
the
restraints
arose
by
reason
of
differences
in
means
of
production
just
like
in
this
case.
the
differences
and
means
of
production
in
the
carpenters
case
and
the
union
want
a
wage
increase
in
san
francisco.
now,
the
san
francisco
companies
had
one
way
of
producing
lumber
products,
the
washington,
oregon
people
had
a
different
way.
and
the
labor
union
and
the
san
francisco
counties
got
together
and
fixed
up
high
wage
scale
tailored
to
fit
the
san
francisco
companies,
impractical
to
apply
in
washington
or
oregon.
they
put
in
the
protective
wage
clause
that's
what
it
was,
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
we've
got
all
of
those
restraints
here
together
with
others.
but
those
restraints
in
this
case
are
all
more
unreasonable
and
unavoidable
because
the
differences
in
means
of
production
in
the
coal
business
arise
by
reason
of
hard
fixed
geological
conditions
that
can't
be
changed.
you
can't
go
to
a
geographical
area
with
a
fencing
traditionally
living
on
that
condition,
for
years
or
decades
and
try
to
pick
in
that
seam
of
coal
to
bring
the
machinery
and
so
you
can
abide
by
this
national
contract.
all
three
cases
involved
the
union
and
the
company's
combining
to
misuse
collective
bargaining
process,
misuse
boycotts,
misuse
strikes,
all
of
paraphernalia
favored
by
the
labor
law.
but
misuse
to
bring
on
restraints
and
further
restraints
in
the
competition
and
the
market.
now,
in
allen
bradley
and
carpenters,
it
was
fairly
contended
that
the
union
in
those
cases
was
following
a
policy
of
favoring
all
its
members.
in
this
case
the
union
case
show
it
benefited
more
than
a
small
percentage
of
its
members.
the
great
majority
had
been
the
victims
rather
than
the
beneficiaries.
in
allen
bradley
and
carpenters,
the
conspiratorial
plan
arose
when
the
union
was
not
concentrating
on
the
economic
or
market
side
of
industry
but
when
the
union
was
because
--
carrying
out
traditional
purposes
of
increasing
memberships
improving
working
opportunities
for
all
the
members
within
this
case
the
conspiracy
arose
when
union
was
openly
admitted,
trying
to
dictate
the
economic
side
of
the
industry.
and
neither
allen
bradley
nor
carpenters
did
the
union
engage
itself
in
the
business
group
being
aided
by
the
making
of
many,
many
millions
of
dollars
of
investments
with
the
expectation
of
the
making
“enormous
pocket”.
in
this
case,
the
union
did
it
exactly
that
according
to
the
direct
testimony
of
its
officers.
now,
neither
allen
bradley
nor
carpenters
was
their
direct
evidence
that
the
understanding
and
purpose
of
the
union
was
that
it
was
aiding
business
groups
to
restraining
trade
in
that
one.
but
that
illicit
purpose,
the
illicit
conspiracy
were
inferred,
the
markets
were
tied
up
to
the
obvious
advantage
of
the
business
groups.
for
all
of
these
reasons,
we
say
that
the
inferences
in
this
case
have
illicit
conspiracy
in
purpose
far
stronger
than
carpenters
or
allen
bradley.
the
rules
on
those
cases
should
apply
more
strongly
and
i
would
like
to
take
off
of
another
phase
of
the
case.
this
has
to
do
with
the
admission
in
the
evidence
of
facts
that
bear
upon
the
combined
effort
of
the
union
and
major
companies
to
impose
this
high
wage
scale
out
of
national
contract
into
all
government
contracts
for
coal,
tva
contracts
under
walsh-healey.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
i
think
that
precisely
what
allen
bradley
says,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
no,
sir.
no
charging
problem.
i
might
say
your
honor,
this
is
a
coal
company
with
partnership
of
three
men.
one
has
died.
it
has
6-8
employees.
it
even
had
difficult
doing
out
of
income
tax
return,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
if
every
thought
of
that
has
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
yes.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
i
would
agree.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
that's
correct.
but
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
remedy
under
labor
law
that
the
conspiracy
behind
all
these
just
like
in
pennsylvania
versus
i
mean
georgia
versus
pennsylvania
railroad,
there's
conspiracy
behind.
certain
activities
that
might
be
legal
on
the
face
of
facts
but
the
labor
law
can
get
behind
to
get
that
conspiracy
certain.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
i
think
it
got
caught
by
a
landrum-griffin,
i'm
not
sure
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
i
didn't.
no,
sir.
i
just
represent
these
little
coal
company.
i
don't
represent
any
association.
i
have
no
idea
what
could
--
did
that
bring
that
case.
i
won't
file
the
charge.
test
case?
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
i
would
say
so
your
honor.
this
is
--
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
right.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
i
think
that's
true,
your
honor.
i
think
they
have
hard
time
when
it
was
still
over
on
small
side
rather
than
the
big
side.
it
just
looks
little
incongruous
under
the
sherman
act.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
yes.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
and
you
have
think
about
the
manpower
situation.
in
this
day
of
automation
it's
coming
on.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
going
be
real
problem.
can
a
labor
union
slant
its
policies
to
favor
one
side
to
the
other.
now,
i
think
there's
been
a
recent
report
from
a
research
institute
of
america
which
points
out
the
difficulties
the
small
companies
are
having
rapidly
feeling
in
this
day
of
automation
and
the
small
company
has
got
a
hard
enough
time
without
having
that
little
labor
policies
slanted
against
it.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
yes
sir.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
yes.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
that's
correct
your
honor
and
--
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
i
think
it
be
of
a
hard
time
--
time
under
the
sherman
act
in
that
kind
of
relationship.
i
don't
want
to
talk
down
the
jewel
tea
case
but
that's
the
way
i
see
it.
i
--
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
i
can't
--
i
can
imagine
the
jury
find
against
one
man.
then
i
think
when
a
union
has
a
tremendous
economic
power
has
in
this
being
time,
it
has
to
be
careful
how
it
use
it.
it's
going
to
be
some
care
taken
in
the
throwing
around
of
this
vast
power
and
i
think
the
sherman
act
is
the
ideal
thing
to
use.
now,
in
applying
noerr
in
this
case,
this
--
easter
railroad
conference
versus
noerr,
and
this
walsh-healey
thing.
in
the
first
place
in
the
noerr
case,
all
of
the
claim
damages
arose
by
reason
of
the
act
to
the
governor
of
pennsylvania.
all
other
restraints
were
governmental
restraints,
outside
the
sherman
act.
in
the
second
place,
in
the
noerr
case,
the
alleged
conspirators
had
no
plan
purpose
or
conspiracy
except
to
exercise
the
constitutional
privilege.
in
the
third
place,
the
noerr
case
did
not
involve
the
government
market
for
goods.
now,
the
reliance
on
noerr
makes
it
necessary
for
us
to
talk
about
some
fundamental
rules
that
we
see
--
as
we
see
the
sherman
act.
in
the
first
place,
we
don't
believe
that
the
sherman
act
case
is
primarily
concerned
with
the
proof
of
overt
acts
as
such.
the
sherman
act
is
concerned
about
not
overt
acts
but
the
conspiracy.
what
is
a
conspiracy?
you
can
have
a
sherman
act
violation
of
proof
without
proven
over
acts
according
the
number
cases.
so,
the
primary
question
goes
to
the
existence
of
the
nature,
the
purposes,
and
intents
of
the
alleged
conspirators.
now,
it
would
seem
that
the
intense
and
purposes
with
the
respect
to
plaintiff's
market
is
prime
concern.
now,
under
existing
sherman
act
case
law,
the
plaintiff
is
confronted
with
little
restraint
and
producing
proof
that
bears
upon
purpose,
intent,
motive,
understanding
on
the
part
of
the
conspirators.
a
wide
variety
of
proof
is
admissible.
it
is
fundamental
that
the
conspiracy
can
be
prove
by
a
course
of
conduct
and
many
cases
have
said
that
a
conspiracy
can
seldom
be
proved
by
direct
evidence
you
must
resort
to
circumstantial
evidence
to
the
course
of
conduct.
and
we
believe
these
means
that
all
course
of
conduct
that
logically
bears
upon
the
purposes
and
intents
in
the
marketplace
particularly
as
it
bears
on
plaintiff's
market.
not
just
isolated
segments
of
this
course
of
conduct
as
late
as
37
u.s.
continental
ore
company
versus
union
carbide,
the
court
reiterated
the
rule.
in
cases
such
as
this,
plaintiff
should
be
given
the
full
benefit
of
their
proof
without
tightly
compartmentalizing
the
various
parts
and
wiping
the
slate
clean
after
scrutiny
of
each.
the
character
and
fact
of
a
conspiracy
are
not
to
be
judged
by
dismembering
it
and
viewing
its
separate
parts
but
only
by
looking
at
these
as
a
whole.
the
duty
of
the
jury
was
to
look
at
the
whole
picture,
so
what
was
whole
picture
in
this
case,
particular,
with
respect
to
plaintiff's
market.
during
the
course
of
this
conspiracy
after
1950,
there
arose
the
great
new
market
for
coal
in
the
form
of
tva's
theme
plant
system.
this
was
to
become
the
largest
single
market
for
coal
in
the
country.
it
was
very
important
market
in
this
case
because
it
was
by
far
the
most
important
market
of
the
plaintiffs.
it
lay
up
the
doorstep
of
these
seam
areas
of
east
kentucky
in
southeast
--
southern
--
east
tennessee
and
the
union
and
major
companies
gave
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
that
market
in
this
record.
the
union
was
having
difficulty
policing
and
enforcing
its
national
contract
down
there.
as
i've
said,
we
have
a
war
now.
in
the
midst
to
this
struggle,
the
union
and
major
companies
got
together
and
impose
the
high
wage
scale
from
national
contract
into
the
tva
contracts
for
coal
under
walsh-healey,
for
the
purpose,
it
was
said,
of
barring
from
the
government
market
the
companies
that
would
not
pay
that
scale
for
the
benefit
of
the
union
it
said
and
for
the
benefit
of
this
so-called
“fair
employers”.
now,
that
walsh-healey
determination
was
twice
as
high
as
that
determined
by
secretary
of
labor
and
any
other
industries.
and
it
covered
up
the
tva
term
market
for
coal,
the
large
contracts.
but
tva
persisted
in
carrying
on
its
smaller
spot
market
program.
many
contract
below
$10,000
except
from
walshey-healey.
tva
persisted
in
doing
that
over
the
rigor
subjections
of
the
union
and
the
major
companies,
once
again
working
together.
its
spot
market
was
designed
by
tva
to
allow
the
loc
--
small
local
producers
stay
alive.
after
all,
one
the
purposes
of
congress
in
establishing
tva,
was
to
aid
in
the
development
of
the
resources
of
the
area.
coal
was
the
primary
natural
resource.
so
when
tva
persisted
in
carrying
on
the
spot
market,
the
major
companies
led
by
two
unions
owned
financed
companies,
financed
during
this
period
by
the
union
dumped
enormous
qualities
of
coal
on
that
relatively
small
spot
market
at
ridiculously
low
prices,
predatory
prices,
dropping
prices,
depressing
prices.
the
only
market
that
client
had
of
any
substance
was
wrecked
and
trying
to
stay
alive
on
that
market,
plaintiff
could
go
in
there
under
this
predatory
situations
and
was
the
damage
and
that's
kind
of
damage
we're
trying
to
recover
in
this
case,
the
jury
award.
now,
plaintiff
would
have
no
remedy.
the
jury
could
not
understand
or
judge
the
overall
nature
of
this
conspiracy
particularly
as
it
bore
on
plaintiff's
market
unless
the
whole
course
of
conduct
of
these
conspirators
would
put
in
the
evidence
as
is
the
case
any
sherman
act
case.
now,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
in
these
conspirators
to
carry
on
this
overall
plan
purpose
and
conspiracy
any
more
so
than
all
of
these
all
these
other
sherman
act
cases
that
involve
a
broad
conspiracy
direct
competition
by
any
means
at
hand
whether
that
means
be
a
legal
or
illegal.
i'd
like
to
go
once
step
further
and
i
still
think
this
is
sound,
if
we
just
can
find
the
picture
to
the
solicitation
of
the
secretary
of
labor
to
impose
terms
in
government
contracts
that
would
bar
the
goods
of
competitors.
suppose
the
conspiracy
was
only
that
narrow.
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
if
it
was
only
that
narrow.
suppose
the
conspiracy
only
involve
the
solicitation
of
the
secretary
of
labor
to
impose
conditions
in
government
contracts
that
would
bar
the
goods
of
competitors.
and
i
think
that
there
would
be
a
danger
and
any
conspiracy
case
involving
conspiracy
to
impose
boycotts
in
the
government
market
or
to
impose
terms
and
conditions
in
the
government
contract
that
would
bar
the
goods
of
competitors,
there
would
be
danger
in
restrictive
proof
that
logically
bears
on
the
purposes
and
intents
of
the
conspirators.
in
perkins
versus
lukens
steel
company,
this
court
said
that
the
walsh-healey
act
was
not
a
regulation
of
business
practices.
it
was
a
setting
of
government
purchasing
policy
and
the
sectary
of
labor
acts
as
a
purchasing
agent
in
the
fixing
of
terms
and
conditions
in
government
contracts
under
walsh-healey.
now,
when
conspirators
go
to
any
customer
or
to
the
purchasing
agent
of
any
customer
under
a
conspiracy
to
engage
in
bid
rigging
or
to
impose
boycotts
in
the
market
or
engage
in
other
unfair
plan,
it
can
always
be
said
that
they
are
engaging
in
the
constitutional
right
of
free
speech
when
they
communicate
with
that
purchasing
agent.
but
that
does
not
save
them
in
the
sherman
act
case
from
the
effect
of
proof
on
purpose
and
intent
that
comes
out
of
that
communication.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
if
their
sole
purpose
was
to
freeze
that
somebody
else,
to
impose
a
boycott
in
a
market,
in
the
government
market.
and
the
government
market
--
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
i
think
if
their
sole
purpose
in
going
to
congress
or
to
any
other
government
agent
to
impose
a
boycott
in
the
government
market
under
plan
to
monopolize
or
restrain
trade.
well,
of
course,
if
congress
passes
the
law
that
would
in
fact
repeal
sherman
act
but
if
you're
considering
some
other
market,
if
--
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
yes.
if
the
congress
would
--
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
because
congress
can
pro
tanto
or
to
that
extent
repeal
the
sherman
act,
assuming
that
it
passes
that
law.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
i
think
the
sherman
act
protects
the
government
market
unless
congress
says
to
the
contrary.
and
if
congress
imposes
a
boycott
itself,
its
pro
tanto
repeal
the
sherman
act
to
that
extent.
but
the
sherman
act,
i
believe
congress
intended
to
protect
the
government
market.
certainly,
that's
all
of
the
intent
of
all
these
recent
sherman
act
cases
being
brought
by
various
governmental
units.
it
seems
to
be
necessarily
to
protect
themselves
under
it.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
if
they
were
engaging
in
constitution
right
in
going
to
those
people.
no,
sir.
the
noerr
case
does
not
go
to
the
rule
of
exclusion
of
evidence.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
all
they
are
saying
is
that
this
evidence
should
have
been
excluded.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
well,
we
--
our
damage
--
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
--
our
damages
does
not
come
from
the
governmental
restraint.
it
comes
when
the
predatory
price
--
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
we're
using
this
to
show
the
course
of
conduct,
the
motive,
purpose,
and
intent
bearing
upon
plaintiff's
market.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
has
bearing
upon
their
motive,
intent,
and
purpose
with
the
respect
to
plaintiff's
market,
to
knock
the
plaintiffs
out
and
to
take
over
the
market
themselves.
justice
learned
--
judge
learned
hand
held
in
that
pfotzer
extinguisher
case,
aqua
system
case,
you
can
use
this
evidence
to
show
the
motive,
intent,
and
purpose
of
the
conspirators
for
the
respect
to
that
market,
that
government
market.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
the
damages
arise
solely
from
predatory
pricing,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
the
predatory
--
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
the
question
--
the
question
is
whether
they
had
a
conspiracy
to
take
over
that
market.
we
say
that
any
proof
that
logically
bears
upon
the
intent
to
take
over
the
market
is
admissible
and
this
certainly
largely
bears
upon
it.
in
fact,
you
can
explain.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
the
purpose
or
motive
and
intent.
see
it
was
said
that
the
purpose
of
this
was
to
bar
from
the
government
market
these
local
companies
that
were
supplying
tva
and
then
came
along
after
that
the
attack
on
the
spot
market,
they
weren't
successful
and
knocking
them
out
through
governmental
restraint
there.
so,
they
dumped
on
the
coal.
they
did
the
predatory
price
and
that's
the
only
chain
of
events
that
we
can
show
--
to
show
what
the
overall
plan,
purpose,
and
conspiracy
was.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
well,
i
--
no,
sir.
the
jury
could
not
--
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
yes,
sir.
we
had
this
--
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
yes,
sir.
because
we
got
the
question,
was
there
a
conspiracy
to
take
over
this
big
market.
the
great
bulk
of
the
market
was
tied
down
by
the
government
restraint.
we
had
this
smaller
spot
market
and
we
can't
go
to
the
jury
just
on
the
spot
market
to
show
what
the
overall
course
of
conduct
of
the
conspirator's
were
directed
at
this
overall
market.
the
plan,
purpose
and
intent
with
the
respect
to
plaintiff's
market
--
plaintiff's
market,
the
tva
market
could
not
be
understood
by
the
jury
unless
the
overall
markets
were
considered.
and
how
the
plaintiff
was
driven
down
into
a
small
segment
of
it
and
then
was
kicked
out
by
the
predatory
prices.
it
all
bears
on
the
same
course
of
conduct.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
well,
it
shows
the
union
and
the
major
companies--
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
that's
not
the
only
proof
but
i
would
say
it's
a
substantial
part
of
the
whole
--
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
i
think
this
is
far
as
the
rule
to
look
at
the
whole
picture
that
you
find
in
any
sherman
act.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
that's
correct.
mr.
john
a.
rowntree
that's
correct.
it's
always
been
said
that
the
sherman
act
conspiracy
can
be
carried
out
by
legal
means
if
it's
broader
than
a
constitution
privilege.
thank
you,
sir.
