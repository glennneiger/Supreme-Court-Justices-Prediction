mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
may
it
please
the
court.
my
amicus
argument
is
going
to
be
brief
and
it's
going
to
be
a
little
abstract
and
i
therefore
would
like
to
start
out
by
pointing
at
that
precise
point
--
portion
of
the
record
that
we
think
calls
for
a
reversal
in
this
case.
we
look
at
the
case
a
little
bit
differently
from
the
mine
workers.
we
agree
with
them
that
the
evidence
submitted
to
the
jury
was
not
sufficient
to
support
a
judgment
against
the
mine
workers.
but
we
believe
that
the
1700
pages
of
the
record
can
actually
be
reduced
to
about
half
a
dozen
for
the
purposes
of
reversal.
we
think
the
judges'
instructions
require
a
reversal
but
even
though
the
evidence
submitted
which
support
the
type
of
instructions
that
the
judge
gave
to
the
jury
that
those
instructions
are
erroneous.
at
several
points
in
the
course
of
these
instructions,
the
judge
said
in
effect
to
the
jury.page
1556
of
volume
3,
here's
one
of
the
clearest
statements.
the
court
charged
--
this
is
in
the
second
paragraph.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
1556,
mr.
justice
stewart.
“that
if
this
wage
and
welfare
payments
arrived
that
by
the
parties
as
a
result
of
collective
bargaining,
each
party
in
its
own
interest,
there's
no
violation
of
the
sherman
act
in
the
establishment
of
the
wage
rates
and
welfare
provisions
to
the
contract
provided
there
is
no
agreement
between
the
union
and
the
coal
operators
to
fix
high
wage
rates
and
royalty
payments
in
order
to
drive
small
coal
operators
out
of
business.”
this
is
repeated
in
various
forms
throughout
the
court's
charge.
in
effect,
as
we
understand
if
the
court
was
charging
the
jury
that
the
entering
into
of
these
uniformed
contracts,
could
in
itself
quite
a
part
from
such
matters
as
the
suppose
dumping
of
coal
on
this
spot
market
any
other
matter.
the
entering
into
of
these
uniformed
agreements
in
themselves,
in
itself
could
constitute
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and
the
jury
as
we
understand
it
could
make
that
finding.
if
yet
also
found
that
there
was
evidence
to
support
the
notion
that
the
purpose
of
entering
into
these
high
uniformed
rates
was
to
drive
the
small
marginal
operators
out
of
business.
this
we
think
is
error.
as
we
look
at
it,
there
are
two
principles
that
ought
to
govern
antitrust
and
the
field
of
labor,
two
not
one.
and
the
first
one
is
not
a
matter
of
an
exemption
for
labor
unions
based
upon
the
clayton
act
to
the
norris-laguardia
act
read
together.
the
first
one
goes
back
to
the
sherman
act
itself
and
it
is
rather
a
matter
of
coverage
and
the
best
statement
of
the
proposition
that
we
can
find
is
an
apex
hosiery.
in
apex
hosiery,
this
court
stated
that
in
any
case
whether
or
not
involving
a
labor
union,
there
was
no
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
to
the
elimination
of
competition
based
upon
differences
in
labor
standards.
our
first
proposition
is
that
in
any
case
where
it
is
determined
that
the
only
conduct
engaged
in
is
an
elimination
of
competition
based
upon
a
difference
of
labor
standards.
this
in
itself
takes
the
activity
out
of
the
sherman
act
or
it
stated
more
precisely
this
type
of
activity
is
totally
unlike
the
type
of
restriction
upon
commercial
competition,
that
the
sherman
act
is
directed
at.
in
response
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
white,
we
would
say,
yes,
that
a
combination
of
employers
to
fix
uniformed
wages
among
their
employees
would
not
constitute
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
whether
or
not
a
union
was
in
the
picture.
i
do
want
to
make
one
important
qualification.
in
certain
instances,
it
might
be
a
highly
relevant
of
the
determination
of
whether
a
particular
agreement
did
involved
a
labor
standard
as
to
just
how
it
came
about
historically
and
functionally.
we
think
in
this
case,
there
isn't
any
conceivable
question.
wage
rates
are
the
very
core
of
labor
standards
in
the
case
following
in
duty.
there
might
very
well
be
a
need
for
factual
inquiry
as
to
why
there
was
this
arrangement
for
agreeing
upon
uniformed
marketing
hours.
we
think
the
employee's
interest
in
that
case
can
well
be
demonstrated
but
once
the
fact
is
bound
that
a
particular
matter
does
concern
labor
standards
that
as
we
look
at
its
interest.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
it
is
a
matter
simply
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
the
literal
words
without
labor
unions.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
and
that
of
course
is
part
of
the
problem.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
that
is
correct.
i
will
--
i
will
say
this
mr.
justice
harlan
that
in
apex
it's
clear
that
the
court
look
to
the
clayton
act
as
sort
of
a
confirming
gloss
by
congress
upon
the
sherman
act.
but
we
don't
look
to
section
6
for
this
portion
of
our
argument
strictly.
it
goes
to
the
sherman
act
itself
that
labor
standards
are
not
the
type
of
restraint
that
were
ever
intended
to
be
encompassed
at
least
as
interpreted
by
apex.
now,
the
second
principle
--
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
very
true.
your
honor--
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
the
holding
in
apex
certainly
is
limited
to
a
unilateral
union
act.
we
cannot
rely
upon
the
holding
we
rely
upon
the
rationale
that
we
regard
as
the
philosophy
line
behind
apex.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
there
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
the
purpose
as
we
look
at
it
is
irrelevant.
now,
mr.
justice
clark,
let
me
--
let
me
state
it
differently.
in
this
particular
case,
where
there
is
a
uniformed
wage
level
being
established
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
the
purpose
that
the
court
allowed
the
jury
to
infer
was
simply
an
articulation
of
a
purpose
that
is
inherent
in
the
activity
itself.
the
purpose
of
obtaining
uniformed
conditions
throughout
the
industry
is
indeed
to
eliminate
substandard
competition
in
the
most
strict
sense
of
that
term.
that
is
all.
we
would
not
say
the
purpose
was
bad.
we
would
simply
say
the
purpose
was
to
eliminate
substandard
competition.
this
indeed
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
is
what
labor
unions
are
all
about.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
true.
mr.
justice
clark,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
it's
just
two
sides
of
the
coin.
it
depends
upon
how
you
word
it
and
this
is
why
we
are
saying
the
judges
instruction
were
wrong.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
in
this
particular
instance
and
this
might
have
been
a
different
question.
in
this
particular
instance,
no
matter
where
the
aim
may
have
been
directed,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
shop
that
was
made
could
have
not
taken
anyone
out
of
business
as
long
as
he
was
not
substandard
competition.
no
one
was
prevented
from
signing
the
national
contract
with
its
uniformed
terms.
so
consequently,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
some
people
has
the
thought
in
mind
that
particular
people
knowingly
in
advance
would
be
unable
to
meet
the
standards.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
all
on
the
stand,
all
of
the
competitors
could
have
met
the
standards
if
they
were
able
to.
no
one
was
being
excluded
per
se,
only
substandard
competition
and
what
we
regard
as
the
strictest
sense
of
the
term.
in
making
this
argument,
i
certainly
don't
want
to
undercut
what
we
regard
as
the
second
principle
that
controls
to
the
relationship
of
unions
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
that
is
the
principle
developed
in
the
hutcheson
case.
in
hutcheson,
the
clayton
and
norris-laguardia
act
were
read
together
in
effect
to
say
that
conduct
that
was
not
subject
to
an
injunction
was
not
to
be
deemed
in
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
there
was
a
qualification
in
allen
bradley.
i
read
the
two
cases
together
in
effect
to
say
this,
when
a
union
acts
alone,
there
is
no
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
if
the
conduct
that
had
engage
in
is
not
subject
to
an
injunction
under
norris-laguardia
regardless
of
whether
there
is
a
direct
impact
upon
the
product
market.
the
allen
bradley
qualification
assumes
some
direct
impact
upon
the
product
market,
assumes
that
the
arrangement
looks
beyond
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
that
is
the
language
of
allen
bradley
and
imposes
direct
restraints
upon
the
marketing
of
goods
and
services.
when
that
is
done
in
combination
with
a
conspiracy
of
employers
to
restraint
trade
in
a
product
market,
then
the
unions
are
liable
for
violating
the
antitrust
laws.
we
say
therefore
in
every
case,
there
are
two
questions
to
be
asked.
is
the
subject
matter
of
the
agreement
or
the
activity,
a
labor
standard?
that
is
to
say
in
matter
of
wages,
hours
or
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
yes.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
and
we
regard
the
(inaudible)
case
as
that
case.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
would
require
--
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
yes.
this
is
our
point.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
have
no
employer
conspiracy
restraint
trade
and
the
union
is
acting
alone
in
its
own
self-interest,
that
too
--
that
question
too
can
end
any
case.
it
makes
no
difference
then
whether
the
product
market
is
directly
affected.
if
the
union
acts
alone,
there's
--
the
type
of
restraint
is
indifferent
but
if
the
type
of
restraint
only
applies
the
labor
standards,
a
combination
is
indifferent.
and
these,
as
we
look
at
it
are
the
necessary
conclusions
to
be
drawn
not
from
the
holdings
of
this
court
as
to
this
matter
of
labor
standards
but
as
to
the
necessary
philosophy
lying
behind
apex
and
in
subsequent
decisions
of
the
court.
allen
bradley
clearly
stated,
for
example,
that
the
industry-wide
understandings
look
beyond
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
to
the
control
of
the
markets,
the
control
of
prices
and
as
a
means
of
distribution.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
the
factual
inquiry
has
to
be
made
in
every
instance,
mr.
justice
white
and
--
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
yes.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
when
the
agreement
is
made
in
a
--
for
a
purpose
of
maintaining
a
particular
labor
standard.
then
we
say
it's
outside
of
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
we
--
now,
we
would
say
that
an
agreement
made
for
the
purpose
of
excluding
nonunion
competition
would
fall
precisely
within
that
framework.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
yes.
nonunion
standards
or
union
standards
are
what
are
being
protected
in
that
instance.
now,
i
realized
this
can
become
a
close
question
and
allen
bradley
so
shows.
the
difference
between
the
questions
you
post
me,
is
that
it
seems
that
the
thing
the
union
is
out
to
exclude
are
--
is
nonunion
competition.
now
this
of
course,
now
would
raise
many
questions
under
the
secondary
boycott
provisions
at
top
title.
but
as
any
antitrust
matter
certainly,
as
an
antitrust
matter,
i
would
say
that
what
is
being
upheld
is
union
standards
and
therefore
this
would
be
with
our
first
principle
not
a
matter
within
the
coverage
of
the
sherman
act
quite
regard
--
quite
regardless
of
any
labor
exemption.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
i
--
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
the
carpenters
case
as
far
i'm
concerned
is
allen
bradley.
now,
this
court
dealt
with
the
facts
the
carpenters
case
in
san
francisco
very
briefly
because
they're
really
getting
on
to
the
question
of
the
liability
of
the
union
for
the
acts
of
its
agents.
but
insofar
as
they
discuss
the
facts
and
insofar
as
one
goes
back
to
the
federal
reporter
to
find
out
what
the
full
facts
were.
i
would
say
the
carpenters
case
was
simply
an
allen
bradley
situation.
that
is
to
say
the
northern
lumber
companies
were
being
totally
excluded
from
the
san
francisco
market
not
because
they
were
nonunion
or
so
on
but
--
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
well,
mr.
justice
clark,
i
--
i
read
the
decision
in
the
second
--in
the
federal
report
as
indicating,
for
example,
that
there
was
throughout
the
san
francisco
area,
an
artificial
price
standard
maintained,
that
the
union
blocked
contractors
from
using
the
goods
of
this
northern
lumberman
when
they're
trying
to
get
into
san
francisco
that
in
effect,
this
was
not
simply
the
imposition
of
an
exclusionary
clause
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
out
nonunion
labor.
the
purpose
was
to
keep
out
very
specifically
the
northern
lumberman
--
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
even
if
they've
been
organized.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
mr.
justice
--
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
as
i
--
i
understand
your
question
very
well
because
it
is
true
in
the
supreme
court
opinion,
mr.
justice
reed's
reference
to
the
case
seemed
to
indicate
the
unions'
mean
of
enforcement
was
simply
the
provision
for
a
protective
wage
clause.
i
think
it
is
significant
to
note
that
he
then
went
on
to
say
that
a
conspiracy
to
restrain
trade
by
employers
was
no
less
such
because
joined
in
by
union
say
in
allen
bradley.
so
this
question
has
been
decided
and
he
then
went
on
spend
the
greater
part
of
the
opinion
dealing
with
the
question
of
the
liability
of
the
union
for
its
agents
acts.
it
seems
to
me
that
they're
kind
fair
picture
of
what
that
case
was
all
about
or
one
does
have
to
look
at
the
facts
as
reported
from
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
and
it
seems
to
me
that,
it
is
clear
the
union
was
doing
more
in
fact
than
providing
that
protective
wage
clause.
if
the
union
was
actually
helping
to
enforce
by
many
means,
the
prevention
of
those
manufacturers
from
having
their
products
reach
the
market.
my
time
has
expired
your
honors.
i
simply
wish
to
close
with
this
comment
that
in
our
opinion,
the
court's
judgment
was
wrong
because
it
made
the
antitrust
violation
turn
upon
a
jury
articulation
of
a
purpose
that
simply
is
inherent
in
any
union
activity.
that
is
the
elimination
of
substandard
competition
in
the
most
strict
sense
of
the
term.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
your
honor,
i
certainly
would
say
that
this
was
a
labor
standard.
that
labor
standards
embrace
wages,
hours,
job
content.i'm
sure
there
are
many
areas
where
we
begin
to
get
into
questions.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
surely
wages,
hours
and
job
content
are
the
very
core.
and
therefore,
i
would
say
that
restrictions
on
subcontracting
would
indeed
involve
labor
standards.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
union
had
been
trying
to
do
this
on
its
own
through
collective
bargaining
as
was
the
arguendo
assumption
in
allen
bradley,
this
agreement
in
itself
would
not
have
violated
the
antitrust
act.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
he
was
indeed
attempting
to
conform
to
allen
bradley.
and
i'm
not
going
to
stand
here
and
suggest
that
drawing
the
line
between
what
is
a
restraint
on
the
product
market,
on
the
marketing
of
goods
and
services?
and
what
is
simply
the
establishment
of
a
labor
standard
is
in
any
case,
an
easy
line
to
draw?
but
i
think
this
is
the
question
that
court
always
ought
to
have
in
its
mind.
the
court's
theory
went
all
wrong
because
they
loss
sight
of
this
line
and
they
only
looked
at
allen
bradley.
now,
i
would
say
that
the
conspiracy
in
allen
bradley
went
far
beyond,
a
mere
desire
to
maintain
union
conditions.
the
conspiracy
in
allen
bradley
involved
a
very
extensive
interlocking
plan
among
employers
and
unions
and
local
3,
electrical
workers
to
exclude
any
products
from
outside
the
new
york
market.
in
this
situation,
it
seems
to
me,
we
are
presented
with
the
easiest
of
all
conceivable
cases,
a
wage
level
which
i
don't
see
under
any
circumstances
being
inverted
into
a
control
upon
the
product
market.
i
grant
that
there
may
be
lines
on
occasion
that
are
difficult
to
draw.
i
think
the
important
thing
is
to
know
that
the
right
question
is
being
asked.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
not
with
regard
to
wages
in
my
opinion
mr.
justice
white.
i
could
see
that
in
some
situations,
this
would
be
a
very
important
factor.
it
might
be
a
very
important
factor
if
it
became
more
of
a
--
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
in
this
case,
i
think
it's
an
unimportant
factor
because
wages
are
a
labor
standard.
i
don't
think
anyone
in
this
case
suggests
that
wages
are
other
than
a
labor
standard.
in
other
situations,
what
is
the
subject
matter
of
the
agreement
--
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
no.
there's
--
there's
no
agreement
in
those
terms
here
apart
from
the
--
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
well,
i
would
say
that
that
the
maintenance
of
union
conditions
was
a
labor
standard.
but
i
can
see
just
as
in
the
jewel
tea
case
where
we
could
--
we
would
on
occasion
have
to
investigate
what
functionally
--
what
historically
is
being
served
by
the
purpose
of
a
clause?
i
shouldn't
say
by
the
purpose
of
a
clause.
what
is
the
clause
actually
doing?
there
are
certainly
could
be
occasions
when
restricting
market
operating
hours
in
the
part
of
employers
might
raise
antitrust
implications.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
don't
see
how
in
practice
this
could
work
out.
this
is
why
i
just
don't
define
any
problem
with
the
wage
case.
i
find
problems
with
cases
which
that's
get
closer
to
allen
bradley.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
well,
my
analytical
difficulties
as
i
find
this
a
contradiction
in
terms.
i
just
don't
see
how
the
establishment
of
the
wage
--
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
that
is
correct.
it
would
somehow
perhaps
be
a
distribution
of
profits
of
the
employees
in
their
capacity
as
business.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
mr.
justice
white,
in
this
case,
the
judge
did
not
instructed
any
such
terms.
he
was
simply
talking
about
the
elimination
of
the
smaller
producers.
if
--
i
frankly
cannot
visualize
precise
type
of
conspiracy
that
you
have
in
your
mind.
but
my
answer
is
that
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
of
the
instructions
given
by
the
judge,
he
is
stating
a
contradiction
in
terms.
he
is
saying
that
if
the
purpose
was
to
eliminate
small
producers.
this
would
make
an
antitrust
violation
and
i
say
to
that,
of
course,
the
purpose
was
if
you
want
phrase
it
so
to
eliminate
people
who
couldn't
meet
the
standard,
to
eliminate
substandard
competition.
mr.
theodore
j.
st.
antoine
that
is
correct.
