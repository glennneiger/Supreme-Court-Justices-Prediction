mr.
harrison
combs
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
all
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
sixth
circuit
of
appeals.
the
main
question
may
be
stated
as
follows,
where
a
labor
union
is
charged
with
having
conspired
with
employee
or
groups
in
violation
of
the
sherman
antitrust
act
when
it
executed
an
industry-wide
both
the
employer
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
results
in
stabilizing
wages
and
working
conditions
at
levels
to
the
ability
of
some
employers
to
pay.
and
there
is
no
direct
evidence
to
prove
the
conspiracy
may
the
court
or
a
jury
inferring
conspiracy
from
union's
pursuit
of
collective
employee
rights
protected
are
regulated
by
the
facts
with
the
acts
section
7
and
8.
in
my
draft,
the
antitrust
--
at
the
antitrust
immunity
of
labor
unions
and
the
clear
the
proof
requirement
of
section
6
for
the
norris-laguardia
act.
i
think
that
is
the
main
question
in
this
case.
the
respondent
pennington
going
business
at
the
phillips
brothers
coal
company
as
a
partnership
where
the
small
coal
stripping
operation
in
campbell
county,
tennessee,
in
1953,
this
company
executed
what
we
call
in
1950
bituminous
coal
wage
agreement
as
amended
in
1952.
the
company
again
executed
in
1955
amendment
to
bituminous
coal
wage
agreement
and
in
1956
amendment
to
the
agreement.
in
1958,
the
trustees
of
the
united
mine
workers
of
america
will
acquire
retirement
fund
instituted
an
action
against
phillips
for
a
money
judgment
for
delinquent
royalties
due
under
the
provisions
of
the
various
agreements
that
have
signed.
phillips
filed
a
cross
claim
against
united
mine
workers
alleging
that
the
mine
workers,
the
trustees
of
the
welfare
fund
and
certain
coal
companies
not
named
as
parties
had
entered
into
a
conspiracy
to
monopolize
the
coal
industry
by
fixing
the
wage
scales
and
the
payment
for
the
welfare
fund
and
certain
other
provisions
in
the
contract
as
such
levels
as
would
be
tailored
effect,
the
major
coal
companies
but
which
would
be
at
such
a
high
level
that
it
would
force
small
coal
mines
out
of
business.
the
purpose
alleged
by
phillips
was
to
stabilize
the
economics
of
the
coal
industry
and
to
eliminate
the
problem
of
overproduction
by
eliminating
the
smaller
mines
from
the
coal
mining
industry
and
if
the
conspirators
knew
when
they
executed
the
1950
contract
at
this
--
this
could
not
pay
the
wages
and
the
welfare
fund
benefits.
according
to
phillips,
the
union
agreed
to
surrender
its
policy
of
what
they
said
was
controlling
the
working
time
of
the
industry
and
also
to
not
object
to
the
large
coal
companies
recognizing
their
mines
in
order
to
lower
the
cost
of
production.
now,
the
union
in
turn
was
promised
by
the
coal
--
by
the
coal
companies
according
to
phillips
that
the
coal
companies
would
not
object
to
increase
wage
rates
and
increase
payments
to
the
welfare
fund
subject
to
their
ability
to
mechanize
and
absorb
the
cost
and
also,
that
they
would
permit
the
union
to
run
a
welfare
fund,
and
also
to
dominate
the
industry's
employees.
the
conspiracy
as
alleged
was
to
be
consummate
through
the
instrument
of
the
1950
bituminous
coal
wage
agreement
and
its
successive
amendments.
it
is
alleged
that
there
was
an
expressed
agreement
to
that
effect.
the
increased
organizing
activities
after
1950
with
intended
wage
increases
and
welfare
payments,
and
the
operators'
efforts
and
the
union's
efforts
to
obtain
a
minimum
wage
rate
for
the
coal
industry
under
the
walsh-healey
act
and
to
how
the
government
agencies,
the
purchasing
agents
to
comply
there
with
and
the
union's
investments
in
two
coal
companies
were
among
the
elements
which
the
company
claimed
through
the
conspiracy.
the
union
denied
the
conspiracy
and
denied
making
any
agreement
whatsoever
other
than
the
1950
bituminous
coal
wage
agreement.
the
case
was
tried
by
the
jury.
the
jury
rendered
a
general
verdict
fining
that
the
union
had
conspired
beyond
its
exemptions
as
a
labor
union
under
the
antitrust
statutes.
it
did
not
say
with
whom
the
union
had
conspired
or
it
didn't
say
what
elements
that
it
thought
constituted
the
conspiracy.
mr.
harrison
combs
damages
were
assessed
against
the
union,
mr.
justice
harlan
of
$93,000
in
travel
and
then,
the
court
allowed
$55,000
in
damages
for
attorney's
fee.
the
jury
rendered
the
verdict
$93,000.
now
all
motion
n.o.v.
or
for
new
trial,
the
district
court
stated
and
the
sole
reason
that
he
gave
for
sustaining
the
verdict
with
the
jury
was
this
and
i
quote,
“there
to
his
own
proof
that
union
representatives,
a
large
coal
operator
representatives,
discussed
stabilization
of
prices
at
one
time
or
another
during
the
critical
periods
referred
to
in
the
cross
claim.”
we
submit
that
the
evidence
of
the
record
does
not
sustain
the
court's
assumption
of
that
discussion
of
prices.
this
assumption
was
based
upon
two
items
of
evidence
as
far
as
i
know,
a
statement
by
president
louis
that
the
time
may
come
when
a
division
of
work
in
the
industry
may
become
necessary
and
another
statement
that
i'll
come
to
later.
mr.
harrison
combs
your
honor,
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
goldberg
--
mr.
harrison
combs
we
suggest
that
it
could
not
be
that
a
bare
reading
of
both
statements
was
simply
collective
bargaining
that
it's
customary
practice
with
respect
to
that
argument.
mr.
harrison
combs
not
only
--
mr.
harrison
combs
--
not
only
in
the
mining
industry
but
at
all
basic
industries.
now,
the
sixth
circuit
ignored
the
trial
court's
reason
for
sustaining
the
jury's
verdict.
instead,
a
sixth
circuit
cited
what
it
called
or
some
factual
aspects
of
what
they
thought
with
proper
inferences
on
the
part
of
the
jury
could
sustain
the
jury's
verdict.
and
i'll
try
to
discuss
that
within
the
limitations
of
my
time
and
my
colleague.
willing
to
wage
increases
during
the
eight-year
period
of
the
alleged
conspiracy,
that
is
1950
-
1958
and
in
1952
increases
in
payments
to
the
welfare
fund,
the
sixth
circuit
declared
and
i
quote,
“we
think
the
evidence
support
the
contention
of
phillips
that
the
union
knew
that
the
weaker
companies
could
not
meet
the
increased
cost
of
wages
and
welfare
fund
payments
required
by
the
successive
wage
agreements.
and
that
they
would
fall
by
the
wayside
by
reason
thereon
and
that
the
increase
cost
in
the
successive
wage
agreements
voir
dire
to
the
abilities
of
the
major
coal
companies
to
mechanize
and
not
have
their
profits
affected
by
increased
cost.”
and
i
close
quote.
now,
what
are
the
facts
with
reference
to
the
wage
increases
if
the
court
commented
and
book?
the
record
shows
that
the
united
mine
workers
and
the
coal
operators
have
negotiated
collective
bargaining
agreements
on
multiemployer
basis
such
as
inception
of
the
mine
workers
in
1909.
it
says
1941,
wage
increases,
mechanical
loaded
or
hand
loading
or
what
not
have
been
across
the
board
and
across
the
industry.
in
other
words,
the
inside
men,
that
the
outside
men
of
--
they
got
a
dollar
a
day,
it
was
across
the
board
whether
it's
the
hand
loader
or
what
not.
during
the
1946
and
1948
period,
the
miners
obtained
wage
increases
of
$4.05
per
day.
the
welfare
fund
payments
which
was
established
in
1946
when
the
government
had
position
to
mine
at
$0.05
per
ton
with
increase
to
20
cents
per
ton
in
1948.
the
1950
contract
increased
wages
$.77
per
day
and
fund
payments
to
$0.36
per
ton.
now
in
the
eight-year
period
following
the
1950
agreement,
the
period
of
the
alleged
conspiracy,
wages
increased
to
$9.50
per
day
and
fund
payments
from
$.30
to
$.20
per
ton.
there's
no
evidence
that
these
increases
were
too
high
or
out
of
line
within
the
increases
not
the
basic
industries.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
showed
in
our
brief
that
the
mine
workers
were
behind
on
frequency
of
the
increases
during
this
time,
but
still
an
automobile
and
that
the
comparative
increase
and
their
frequency
and
method
of
negotiating
these
were
comfortable
in
the
industry.
these
unions,
in
fact,
we
all
know
look
at
each
others
see
what
each
accomplishes
and
its
pretty
well
of
a
set
out
of
the
results.
now,
that
the
question
of
the
mechanization
of
mine
and
this
was
dealt
with
at
length,
very
lengthy
hearings,
pictures
and
all
of
these.
the
mechanization
of
the
mining
industry,
we
submit,
were
not
brought
about
by
any
conspirator
or
conduct,
it
was
brought
about
the
necessities
of
modern
technology.
the
coal
industry
has
never,
i
mean,
the
mine
workers
had
never
objected
to
mechanization
and
modernization
of
the
mine.
they've
tried
to
get
their
share
of
any
profits
that
may
come
up.
prior
to
1950,
in
1940
as
a
matter
of
fact,
35%
of
coal
underground
was
loaded
by
mechanical
mean.
that's
distinguished
from
hand
loading
with
a
shovel.
and
in
1949,
this
had
increased
to
67%
and
in
1958
that
increased
to
84%
of
mechanical
loaded
underground
thereof.
the
necessity
of
luring
that
cost
should
indicated
with
this
that
the
national
market,
the
share
of
the
national
energy
market
on
a
part
of
coal.
in
1940,
it
was
47%
and
in
1958,
at
the
time
of
this
trial,
it
had
gone
down
to
23%.
despite
the
fact
of
the
increased
on
all
over
these
years,
coal
in
1958
sold
from
40
to
65
cents
a
ton,
cheaper
than
it
did
in
1948.
so
they
certainly
could
not
been
any
harm
to
the
consumer
in
any
way.
now,
there
are
two
other
principal
aspects
pointed
out
with
the
sixth
circuit
that
they
have
thought
warranted
the
jury's
verdict.
one
was
what
they
called
the
land
lease
clause
in
the
contract
and
the
other
is
what
they
call
the
protective
wage
clause.
both
of
these
clauses
provided
an
effect
the
land
lease
clause
did
that
the
signatory
of
operate
but
not
during
the
life
of
the
agreement
lease
up.
his
properties
that
is
sub-refuge
toward
the
application
of
agreement,
the
wages
and
the
benefits
and
i
think
that's
the
clause
first
within
started
in
the
bituminous
coal
contracts
in
1943.
it
was
amended
in
1952
to
include
lands
that
may
be
acquired
by
the
signatory
operator
after
he
had
executed
the
contract
if
they
were
put
into
production
that
the
substitute
clause
would
apply.
now,
the
protective
wage
clause
simply
provided
that
work,
an
operator
under
subcontract
arrangements
bought
coal
and
sold
it
that
the
cost
--
the
labor
of
cost
and
standard
of
that
to
coal
would
have
to
be
at
least
equal
to
the
cost
of
the
contract.
now,
both
of
these
clause
were
inserted
at
their
bargaining
of
years
only
in
and
on
the
part
of
the
union
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
wage
agreement
once
it
was
executed
to
try
to
keep
at
for
being
fairer
rate
on
the
one
hand.
we
submit
that
it
was
a
bargaining
proposition
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
under
the
labor
act.
now,
the
court
commented
that
is
the
court
of
appeal
that
the
land
lease
clause
could
be
used
to
bar
the
smaller
operators
from
coal
reserves.
but
they
ignored
the
testimony
in
the
record
undisputed
that
in
this
country
of
ours,
we
have
1700
years
of
coal
reserve
as
testimony
by
the
head
of
the
division
of
the
bituminous
coal
in
bureau
of
mines.
and
that
if
the
present
degree
of
consumption,
that's
about
450
million
tons
of
coal
a
year.
that
the
--
there
were
8000
mines
in
excess
of
that
8307
producing
coal
of
which
2000
of
those
mines
were
under
the
class
of
pennington.
that
was
smaller
than
that
pennington
and
5000
of
those
mines
were
producing
less
than
10,000
tons
of
coal
per
year.
now,
all
of
these
mines
were
sharing
and
these
1700
years
of
coal
reserves.
now
to
get
to
phillips
specifically,
his
share,
his
price
that
share
in
tennessee
of
coal
production
in
1950,
that
price
the
mines
produced
13%
of
the
tennessee
production,
the
entire
production.
in
1958
with
the
congress
trial,
this
place
of
mines
produced
30%
of
the
tennessee
production.
it
had
doubled
its
production.
the
very
respondent
in
this
case,
he
was
claiming
that
they
have
been
excluded
from
the
industry.
by
1955
and
1958,
the
united
mine
workers
and
signatory
operators
petition
the
secretary
of
labor
for
a
finding
of
a
prevailing
minimum
wage
in
the
coal
industry.
the
mine
workers
consolidation
coal
company
and
several
other
coal
companies
joined
in
the
petition.
this
petition
--
this
petition
was
filed
because
of
the
increase
and
the
purchasing
of
the
tva.
government
purchases
have
risen
a
lot.
now
after
public
hearings,
the
secretary
established
the
minimum
wage
in
1955.
some
of
the
operators
objected
and
they
sought
an
injunction
in
the
district
of
columbia
court
and
they
have
a
hearing
in
the
court,
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
both
courts
sustained
the
finding
of
the
secretary.
now,
the
court
also
approved
its
relevant
that
is
the
sixth
circuit
that
the
secretary
of
labor,
the
late
secretary
james
mitchell
in
1956,
had
made
a
speech
to
the
mine
worker's
convention
at
which
time
he
had
in
the
course
of
his
remarks
described
his
setting
of
a
prevailing
wage
in
the
coal
industry.
and
he
said
that,
he
did
it,
to
preserve
the
industry
against
self-standard
operators.
and
i
think,
the
secretary,
who
did
the
secretary
mentioned
nine
union
operators
that
was
a
purpose
of
the
walsh-healy
act
was
to
keep
the
standards
from
being
pulling
low
and
he
had
established
that.
and
of
course,
mr.
louise
is
very
please
about
it
and
he
responded
to
it
and
said
it,
mr.
mitchell
is
a
good
secretary.
and
that
was
made
one
month
before
the
election
in
1956.
but
this
was
used
as
evidence
to
show
that
the
mine
workers
and
somebody
had
conspired
to
fix
the
market,
so
that
phillips
couldn't
sell
the
coal.
now
the
court,
the
important
thing
about
this
your
honor
is
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
it
was
reasonable
deduction
by
the
jury
to
infer,
with
these
two
things
that
i
have
described,
for
the
jury
to
make
that
the
wage
determination
for
the
coal
industry
adversely
affected
the
operation
of
phillips
in
the
important
tva
market.
well,
i
submit
your
honors,
if
he
couldn't
come
in
the
classification
that
was
the
purpose
not
only
of
the
wage
standard
but
it's
the
purpose
of
the
law.
and
i
submit
that
the
action
here
is
in
direct
conflict
with
this
court's
decision
in
the
noerr
case.
the
presidents
conference
against
noerr
more
than
three
companies
in
which
it
was
alleged
that
the
truckers
tried
to
destroy
the
railroad
by
getting
the
law
passed
that
would
eliminate
their
most
competitors.
and
this
court
is
speaking
to
mr.
justice
black
said
that
the
fact
that
it
may
--
that
the
petitioners
may
have
in
mind
eliminating
some
competitor
wasn't
accepted
in
the
fact,
in
trying
to
get
a
law
passed.
and
trying
to
get
one
imported
and
yet
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
they
didn't
read
the
noerr
case
to
include
the
intent
to
violate
the
antitrust
act
on
the
part
or
to
eliminate
competitors.
and
therefore
that
report
it
was
analogous,
it
could
be
submitted
to
the
jury
for
their
consideration.
and
the
court
said,
“the
jury
could
consider
if
and
see
whether
or
not
that
the
intention
was
to
get
a
prevailing
wage
for
the
benefit
of
the
miners
or
whether
it
was
to
chase
these
small
producers
out
the
coal
industry.”
now,
we
submit
that
court
was
clearly
wrong
in
that.
now,
there's
one
other
item
that
i'd
like
to
discuss
briefly
of
this
so-called
factual
aspects
of
the
court
and
that
is
that
in
1954,
the
mine
workers
executed
a
contract
with
the
west
kentucky
coal
company.
at
the
time
of
the
execution
of
that
contract,
west
kentucky
coal
company
operated
nonunion
for
some
50
years.
at
the
time
of
the
execution,
it
was
shown
that
the
union
owned
in
the
west
kentucky
coal
company
some
85,400
shares
of
common
stock
that
they
have
bought
off
the
market.
in
this
company,
out
of
a
total
by
870
--
4000
shares
and
they
hold
all
--
hold
all
the
50,000
shares
up
to
very
stock.
and
that
subsequent
to
the
signing
of
the
contract,
west
kentucky
purchased
the
national
coal
company
and,
of
course,
the
stockholding
interests
of
mine
workers
went
on
into
the
subsidiary
of
national
coal
company.
and
the
court
declared,
the
sixth
circuit
declared
that
it
was
unreasonable
for
other
jury
to
consider
that
it
was
a
purpose
of
the
union
in
acquiring
the
stock
to
have
a
very
immaterial
it
was,
if
not
the
determining
was
and
the
policy
to
manage
with
the
operations
of
these
two
coal
companies.
now
as
i
said
neither
of
these
companies
were
signatories
in
1950,
it
didn't
come
until
1954
and
the
facts
are
undisputed
by
six
or
seven
witnesses
that
the
mine
workers
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do,
with
the
management,
with
the
marketing
or
the
purchasing
policies
of
west
kentucky
coal
company
at
any
time.
and
the
fact
that
west
kentucky
coal
company
may
have
entered
into
bids
with
the
tva
and
whatever
they
did,
that
the
mine
workers
had
nothing
to
do
with.
and
i
submit
that
the
facts
are
undisputed
on
that
case
and
i
certainly
do
not
see
where
this
evidence
would
be
admissible.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes,
your
honor.
only
two
coal
companies
at
that
time.
mr.
harrison
combs
they
had
loaned
--
they
have
not
loaned
but
they
had
under
with
a
loan
to
the
west
kentucky
coal
company,
one
loan
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
harrison
combs
same
company.
and
they
have
made
a
loan
of
a
substantial
amount
to
another
company
in
1959
in
the
eastern
part
of
kentucky.
the
purchase
of
lease
is
not
set
here.
so
that
is
all
the
way
for
that.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes.
no.
no,
your
honor
not
exactly.
you
have
to
get
out
of
this
way.
these
two
coal
companies
operated
in
the
western
part
of
the
tva
system.
phillips
operated
in
the
eastern
system.
neither
one
sold
in
the
--
mr.
harrison
combs
now,
the
western
flowing
down
to
mississippi
river
and
the
tva's
extends
over
next
to
kentucky
and
down
to
alabama
then
come
back
up
to
tennessee.
and
the
coal
of
transportation
problems,
the
coal
is
sold
by
the
west
kentucky
people,
are
sold
to
the
western
division
because
you
got
water
ways
and
the
freight
rates.
now
of
course,
i
want
to
be
frank
about
this,
the
phillips
claims
that
it
didn't
make
any
difference
were
which
claim
about
the
coal
with
the
whole
land
way
and
the
one
loaded
system
and
they
were
all
in
competition
therefore.
mr.
harrison
combs
this
involves
spot
market
because
phillips
says
--
said
he
wasn't
shape
to
compete
for
term
markets.
mr.
harrison
combs
and
that's
very
low
cost
coal
and
it's
coal
and
ordinarily
that
are
substantial
company
don't
want
to
prove
with.
mr.
harrison
combs
low
price
coal
unless
the
markets
were
bad
then
they
sell
it
to
anybody
that
can.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes,
your
honor.
we
discussed
that
with
quite
a
few
statistics
on
it.
we
discussed
it
in
the
brief
that
is
plain.
but
i
think
the
facts
will
show
you,
your
honor
that
in
1956,
when
they
are
talking
about
its
start,
the
west
kentucky's
bids
followed
the
market.
it
was
not
noerr
and
practically
all
the
institute,
they
were
the
highest
bidders.
there
were
not
too
many
bids
there.
in
1956,
it
was
the
top
consumption
of
the
tva's
system
and
from
1956
to
'57
and
58,
national
coal
production
pay
all
from
500
and
some
on
million
tons.
now
in
approximate
400
million
and
it
was
push
in,
and
the
tva
said
itself
that
the
--
that
because
whether
factors
of
loans
that
caused
the
price
to
drop.
now,
the
new
evidence
whatsoever
that
west
kentucky
conferred
with
the
union
or
with
the
other
companies
with
reference
to
the
bids
that
made.the
evidence
is
completely
to
the
contract.
mr.
harrison
combs
your
honor,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that's
exactly
our
position
and
we
say
that
the
evidence
is
clear
on
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i'm
really
say
this
to
the
court
that
there's
very
little
dispute
while
there's
a
lot
evidence
in
here
and
very
little
dispute
about
the
facts,
very
little,
anywhere
with
these
papers
and
then
on
and
off.
now
--
mr.
harrison
combs
i
think
fairly
reading
that
record
there
that
it
shows
they
did
it
to
expand
the
working
opportunities
of
the
members.
they've
been
certified
in
this
company
by
the
board.
it
come
in
this
court
and
then
affirmed
to
the
40's.
they've
been
trying
to
organize
in
for
50
years
and
i
think
one
thing
was
trying
to
get
contract
for
the
members
and
that
what's
the
testimony
was.
mr.
harrison
combs
yes,
it
would
to
this
extent
and
i
am
glad
you
asked
that
because
i
can
tell
you
what
to
test
and
what
it
was.
that
question
was
asked
the
chairman
of
the
board
in
west
kentucky
and
mr.
louise.
testimony
of
both
of
them
is
substantially
is
this
that
well
that
when
they
loaned
the
money
to
the
captain
that
they
knew
he
was
an
industrial
employee,
who
believed
in
collective
bargaining
and
that
there
was
no
understanding,
there
was
no
need
for
any
understanding
of
all
but
what
if
he
operated
the
coal
company
or
have
anything
to
do
with
it
that
he
would
comply
with
collective
bargaining.
now,
that's
the
test
to
the
both
of
them.
that's
all
the
testimonies
of
these.
mr.
harrison
combs
under
the
evidence
as
we
have
it
now.
i
don't
think
it
make
any
difference,
your
honor
because
there
is
no
testimony
or
whatsoever
that
the
two
companies
did
anything
that
would
allow
a
jury
to
infer
that
they
were
participating
in
a
conspiracy.
the
supported
lists
are
back
in
1950
and
the
pricing
policies
or
whatever
you
have.
the
evidence
is
very
profuse
on
that
and
it's
uncontradicting,
so
the
degree
of
control
for
the
companies
as
stockholders
or
the
mine
workers
i
think
it's
irrelevant
on
the
evidence
here.
unless
i
disputed
this
talk
and
--
mr.
harrison
combs
i
would
think
so
under
the
doctrine
of
the
apex.
i
don't
think
that's
the
type
of
restraint.
mr.
harrison
combs
i
misunderstood
you.
mr.
harrison
combs
i
think
it
could.
i
don't
know
but
under
apex
the
service
talks
about
marketing
partnership,
marketing
and
product
mortgage
rather
than
the
question
of
labor
standards.
and
if
they
in
good
faith
pay
these
workers
and
they
got
their
money
on
that
elimination
of
their
cost
on
that
basis,
i
don't
know.
mr.
harrison
combs
i
would
think
so
--
mr.
harrison
combs
the
mere
fact
that
the
union
does
the
bargaining
and
gets
the
same
thing
that
the
companies
may
agree
together
may
get
without
that,
i
don't
think
it
would
bring
it
under
the
antitrust
act.
i
don't
think
that
would
do
that.
i'd
like
to
--
be
as
brief
as
i
can.
i
really
think
that
this
case
that
the
trust
of
the
respondent,
a
fair
reading
with
the
case
is
directed
against
multiemployer
bargaining
and
against
uniform
wages
and
working
conditions.
now,
the
respondent
says
in
his
brief
on
page
28
and
i
quote,
“a
union
must
expect
itself
to
be
finally
charged
when
it's
so-called
“industry-wide
campaign”
or
“high
uniformed
wages”
but
if
it's
some
groups
in
the
company
using
machines
rather
than
manpower
by
letting
and
takeover
the
markets.
but
forces
larger
than
the
company
out
of
the
industry
and
the
union
must
expect
the
challenge
to
come
from
the
people
who
have
been
hurt.”
now,
respondents
further
suggest
that
the
district
jury
should
be
the
ages
need
to
determine
the
economic
says
of
the
bargaining
agreement.
now,
we
totally
disagree
with
that
concept.
in
the
first
place,
we
submit
that
it
cannot
be
successfully
argued
with
most
of
the
employer
bargaining
is
illegal
under
the
sherman
act
nor
is
it
opposed
to
national
labor
policy.
now,
the
union
may
concede
it
to
be
to
the
best
interest
of
its
members
to
make
separate
contracts
with
marginal
or
substandard
employees
and
allowing
to
conducts
sweatshop
operations,
paying
low
wages
and
providing
a
substandard
safety
and
health
conditions
in
order
to
keep
their
members
working.
on
the
other
hand,
the
union
may
believe
these
best
interests
are
served
by
insisting
of
on
a
living
wage,
a
decent
wage,
working
conditions,
and
safety
standards
but
those
of
its
members
do
continue
with
work
even
though
these
standards
may
put
less
efficient
employers
out
of
business.
the
sherman
act
does
not
prohibit
either
type
of
agreement
nor
does
the
jury
have
the
right
to
pass
upon
the
wisdom
or
the
unwisdom
of
the
union's
judgment
as
to
which
of
the
policies
it
chooses
to
consider
the
fact
that
there's
a
doctrine
of
united
states
against
hutcheson
at
312
u.s.
219.
at
apex
hosiery
company
against
leader
decided
with
this
court
in
1940,
for
the
narrow
brief,
this
court
said,
“sets
an
order
to
render
a
labor
culmination
effective
and
must
eliminate
the
competition
from
nonunion
made
us
and
elimination
of
price
competition
based
on
differences
in
labor
standards
is
the
objective
of
any
national
labor
organization.
but
this
effect
on
competition
has
not
been
considered
to
be
in
kind
of
curtailment
prohibited
by
sherman
act.
in
fact
to
the
same
effect
as
allen
bradley
company
against
local
number
3,
this
court's
decision
in
1945.
and
we
think
this
covers
this
case
this
court
from
hutcheson,
where
this
court
said
at
page
232
of
hutcheson
312
u.s.
219,
“so
long
as
a
union
acts
in
its
self-interest
and
does
not
combined
with
non-labor
groups,
elicits
and
the
elicit
under
section
20
are
not
to
be
distinguished
by
the
rightness
or
wrongness,
the
selfishness
or
unselfishness
within
of
which
the
particular
union
activities
ought
to
mean.”
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
must
be
accommodated
with
the
national
labor
policy
expressed
in
other
congressional
legislations
such
as
the
clayton
act,
section
6;
the
policy
was
stated
in
this
case
as
hutcheson
--
this
court's
hutcheson
case.
another
federal
legislation
takes
labor
standards
out
of
competition,
fair
labor
standards
act,
the
law
chill
act,
public
contracts
for
the
entire
department.
the
jury
in
this
case
your
honors
was
handed
in
multitude
of
unrelated
facts
and
circumstances.
they
were
unrelated
by
time,
by
distance,
nature,
and
motivation.
the
only
thread
occur
from
the
record
to
time
and
to
gather
as
the
constant
reiteration
of
the
respondent's
counsel
that
there's
a
national
conspiracy
to
monopolize
the
coal
industry
on
the
part
of
the
larger
operators
against
small
others.
