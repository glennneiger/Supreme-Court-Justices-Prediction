that's
not
what
justice
reed
said
and
that's
not
my
understanding
of
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
justice
tom
c.
clark
we
said
we
do
not
conform
to
the
rates
of
wages
and
working
conditions
of
this
agreement
and
that
agreement
is
in
san
francisco
area.
now,
the
mails
is
from
the
north
in
oregon
what
and
whether
is
the
inform
to
these
wages
as
i
remember
the
case
(inaudible)
or
it
they
had
complied
conformed
to
the
wage
scale
in
san
francisco,
the
lumber
could
come
in.
but
they
were
in
a
mass
production
considered
and
identify
with
that
and
that's
why
i
think
they
had
sort
of
a
chinese
law
would
be
describing
without
any
hearing
here
that
made
the
short
case
doesn't
come
within
this.
and
i'm
just
asking
you,
how
you?
