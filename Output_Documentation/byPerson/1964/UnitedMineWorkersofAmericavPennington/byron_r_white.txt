well,
assume
that
the
--
what
would
your
answer
be
if
the
union
owned
a
100%
both
these
companies?
there
is
no
question
about
it
from
coal
or
the
board,
the
--
and
the
business
policies?
justice
byron
r.

oh,
let's
assume
there's
no
labor
--
if
you
say
that
let's
assume
that
two
employers
did
not
organized
at
all
and
yet
they
make
an
agreement
that
they
will
not
--
that
they
will
pay
their
workers
the
same
amount
of
wages,
is
that
legal
under
the
sherman
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
said
--
i
said
these
are
two
unorganized
companies.
no
union
involved
and
the
two
employers
agreed
among
themselves?
justice

do
you
think
that
violates
the
sherman
act?

don't
you
mr.
antoine
--
wouldn't
it
make
a
good
deal
or
difference
to
your
analysis
that
the
union
also
owned
a
couple
of
other
companies
in
the
multiemployer
bargaining
unit
as
to
whether
it
was
the
solely
a
labor
standard
they
were
maintaining
or
not?
justice
byron
r.

why
isn't
it
an
important
factor
in
this
case?
justice
byron

white
now,
what
it's
trying
to
do
is
to
characterize
--
characterize
somehow
the
conduct
of
the
union
and
the
employer
in
agreeing
not
to
deal
with
nonunion
employers.
and
you're
saying
you're
doing
it
to
maintain
a
wage
standard
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
there
were?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
my
question.
it's
whether
when
you
might
--
i
didn't
concede
that
it
was
a
wage
standard.
i
--
my
question
was
whether
or
not
this
kind
of
evidence
of
ownership
may
not
very
well
bare
on
whether
the
agreement
is
a
--
it
is
--
it
isn't
an
attempt
to
set
a
wage
standards
or
not.
smith
goes
to
that
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
what
extent
--
was
there
an
agreement
that
the
major
coal
companies
would
not
buy
the
so-called
to
the
independence
--
justice
byron
r.
white
which
means
that
--
which
--
the
first
thing
which
means
that's
it
requires
a
self
help
for
the
many
companies
that
doesn't
have
a
contract
with
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
couldn't
be
--
it
couldn't
do
much
of
the
same
with
the
displayed
oil,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
labor
board
eliminated?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
engagement
of
the
labor
board
eliminating
the
law
agreeing
not
to
buy
coal?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
that
somebody
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
jury
was
not
at
fault,
so
the
jury
was
instructed
about
its

in
other
words,
the
approach
by
these
parties
with
tva
to
get
changes
in
policies
with
respect
to
coal
mine
standing
alone
with
no
respect
to
violation
of
law,
could
not
be
considered
by
the
jury
to
violate
the
law
standing
alone
that
the
parties
had
a
legal
right
to
approach
the
