so
if
that's
the
condition
on
the
basis
that
it's
improvident,
that's
what
i
haven't
quite
understood
about
your
argument.
i
would
if
that's
relevant
the
connection
was
their
determination
of
the
issue
as
whether
it's
provident,
what
statutory
provision
bars
them
from
considering
from
hearing
as
one
of
the
elements?
justice

suppose
somebody
had
bought
something
about
$100
and
then
they'd
sold
at
leasehold
in
this
for
million,
could
you
say
that
that's
not
relevant
in
connection
with
determining
whether
it
affects
this
problem.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
other
would
be
relevant.
justice
hugo

just
simply
because
you
come
back
to
the
word
profit.
what
i
was
thinking
about
was
in
determining
whether
a
purchase
is
provident,
always
i
suppose,
one
of
the
element
would
be.
what's
been
the
--
when
the
sell
we're
here
for?
not
that
it
be
quit
buying
it
but.
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
other
lease
so
far,
how
much
--
in
the
selling
of
product
for?
but
that
would
have
some
kind
of
an
element,
irrelevant
in
connection
with
determining
providence
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
man
making
a
purchase
in
ordinary
goodness
i
would
think,
would
look
to
that
if
he
could,
i
don't
see
why
he
wouldn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
a
quick
question
of
pure
relevance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
whether
statute's
forbidden
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
a
man
went
into
store,
buy
something
and
he
found
out
quite
of
a
(inaudible)
the
price
they
had
on
it
was
to
give
them
2000%
profits.
he
might
suspect
that
he
had
bargained
around
with
him
a
little,
he
could
get
them
cut
price.
that
would
be
irrelevant
consideration
i
would
think
for
him
to
have
in
mind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'm
talking
about
the
relevance
not
the
degree
of
relevance.
