you
have
the
panhandle
case
and
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
what's
your
argument
today
is
the
essence,
the
dissent
in
panhandle,
is
that
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you're
distinguishing
it
but
it's
--
your
argument
sounds
like
the
dissent
that
i
joined
in
the
panhandle
case.
justice
william
o.
douglas
which
raises
a
peculiar
question
perhaps
just
for
me
because
having
taken
this
point
of
view
of
yours
originally
in
that
case
that
being
truly
a
problem
not
of
constitutional
dimension
but
of
statutory
of
construction,
whether
we
should
apply
stare
decisis
the
type
of
which
that
should
operate,
the
extent
to
which
we
should
feel
free
to
change
the
order
by
the
majority
and
so
on.
those
are
the
considerations
in
my
mind.

the
value
of
this
item
in
any
rate
base
that
you

yes
in

at
this

the

of
