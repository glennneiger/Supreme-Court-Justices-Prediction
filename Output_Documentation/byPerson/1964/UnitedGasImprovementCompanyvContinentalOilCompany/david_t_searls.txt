mr.
david
t.
searls
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please.
texas
eastern
transmission
corporation
which
is
the
pipeline
respondent
in
this
case
filed
its
application
in
this
case
for
certificate
of
public
conveyance
and
necessity
eight
years
ago
before
the
federal
power
commission.
its
application
was
for
authority
to
construct
certain
facilities
along
its
main
line
and
also
to
build
a
22-mile
line
from
its
main
line
for
this
rayne
field
and
a
compressor
station
on
that
22-mile
line.
during
this
period
of
time,
there
have
been
three
commission
opinions,
two
decisions
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
two
different
appeals.
both
court's
of
appeals,
the
d.c.
circuit
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
sale
of
these
leases
was
a
non-jurisdictional
sale
but
each
court
of
appeals
said
basing
their
decision
upon
the
decision
of
this
court
in
catco,
that
the
commission
could
determine
whether
the
acquisition
cost
of
texas
eastern
were
consistent
with
public
convenience
and
necessity.
in
1959,
six
years
ago,
the
commission
rendered
its
decision
in
opinion
number
322
in
which
it
held
that
this
was
a
non-jurisdictional
sale
of
leases
and
the
commission
in
that
opinion
disclosed
why
this
was
very
important
public
interest
for
the
pipeline
company
too
far
of
this
basis.
in
this
order
issued
by
the
commission,
it
required
texas
eastern
to
build
this
pipeline
and
these
other
facilities
within
six
months.
texas
eastern
complied
with
the
order,
built
the
facilities,
and
since
august
19,
1959,
has
been
taking
natural
gas
from
the
rayne
field.
now,
petitioners
say
here,
and
their
position
as
we
understand,
is
that
the
sellers
of
this
leases
and
texas
eastern
you
were
trying
to
circumvent
the
powers
and
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission
and
rights
on
with
the
natural
gas
act.
we
take
issue
on
that.
we
say
the
purpose
in
buying
these
leases
was
not
to
circumvent
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission
but
we
say
as
the
situation
developed
and
as
the
circumstances
disclosed
by
this
record
to
establish,
it
developed
that
the
only
feasible
deal
that
could
be
made
in
this
case
was
for
texas
eastern
to
buy
the
leases
and
that
natural
gas.
and
why
do
i
say
that?
because
there
was
a
hearing
at
that
time
texas
eastern
proposed
to
buy
this
gas
from
these
companies
under
gas
sales
contract.
there
was
an
extended
hearing
before
an
examiner
and
in
that
hearing
the
purchase
of
this
gas
by
texas
eastern
which
was
opposed
by
some
of
its
most
substantial
customers
including
the
united
gas
improvement
company
of
philadelphia.
and
one
of
the
main
bases
for
the
opposition
was
this,
if
texas
eastern
buys
this
gas
and
this
was
brought
up
by
extensive
cross-examination
of
texas
eastern
witnesses,
it
will
trigger
“favored
nation”
clauses
under
texas
eastern's
insisting
contracts,
there
being
32
contracts
was
brought
out
on
cross-examination
will
be
triggered
and
the
increase
in
the
annual
cost
of
natural
gas
with
texas
eastern
would
be
$10
million
a
year
which
would
be
passed
on
to
the
customers
and
in
turn
of
course
to
the
consumers.
and
so
these
customers
of
texas
eastern
has
one
as
the
public
service
commission
in
new
york,
vigorously
opposed
this
transaction.
and
in
the
meantime
and
has
been
stated
by
the
solicitor
general
by
mr.
coleman,
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
catco
case.
it
really
went
off
on
the
point
that
the
commission
didn't
have
jurisdiction
that's
--
of
that
application
but
that
was
reversed
by
this
court
but
nevertheless
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
made
it
very
clear
that
prices
and
cost
should
be
considered
by
the
commission
in
a
certificate
case
and
as
your
honors
said,
when
that
price
falls
within
the
disputed
area,
it's
one
of
the
most
relevant
factors
to
be
considered
in
a
certificate
case.
so
in
view
of
the
holding
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit,
and
in
view
of
this
opposition
which
had
taken
place
on
the
hearing
in
regard
to
these
gas
sales
contracts,
and
knowing
that
this
question
about
triggering
these
“favored
nation”
clauses,
would
be
a
most
serious
obstacle
to
a
certificate.
texas
eastern
then
approached
these
producers
who
became
sellers
to
sell
the
leases
to
texas
eastern
because
if
they
purchased
leases
instead
of
natural
gas,
it
would
not
trigger
the
“favored
nation”
clauses.
and
it
also
have
been
brought
out
on
cross-examination
of
texas
eastern
witnesses
at
this
first
hearing
that
it
would
trigger
not
only
the
“favored
nation”
clauses
in
texas
eastern
contracts,
but
it
would
trigger
what
was
known
as
third
party
“favored
nation”
clauses
in
the
contracts
of
other
pipeline
companies.
and
so
texas
eastern
proposed
to
these
producers,
sell
me
the
leases
covering
all
of
the
area
through
the
known
horizons
that
are
known
to
be
productive.
after
all,
texas
eastern
knew
that
producers
would
not
sell
in
deep
horizons
which
have
never
been
explored
by
the
drill
bit,
because
they
might
be
given
away
an
oil
field
if
they
did
that.
any
sophisticated
producer
or
a
company
just
as
doesn't
do
that.
well,
after
considering
the
matter,
this
proposal
by
texas
eastern
to
buy
the
leases
in
which
they
contented
this
will
not
trigger
the
“favored
nation”
clauses
in
our
contract,
appeal
to
these
companies
who
turned
out
to
be
the
sellers
of
the
leases.
first,
they
would
get
a
$12,420,500
cash
payment
at
the
time
of
the
closing
transaction.
they'd
get
money
now.
they
would
get
the
balance
of
the
consideration
over
a
period
of
16
years
in
annual
installments
instead
of
waiting
for
the
life
of
the
field
which
was
31
years,
so
as
a
result
they
were
willing
to
take
a
substantially
lower
cost
for
their
natural
gas.
now,
under
the
gas
sales
contracts,
price
would
been
22.6
cents
but
if
you
take
the
amount
of
recoverable
gas
that
was
conveyed
or
was
covered
by
these
leases,
the
price
was
17.15
cents
that
it
cost
texas
eastern,
and
that
was
the
price
first
to
be
received
by
these
sellers
of
the
leases.
another
factor
that
appealed
to
the
sellers
of
the
leases
was
this,
if
they
can
sell
leases
instead
of
natural
gas,
they
could
get
possibly
catco
gains
tax
treatment,
they
thought
they
could.
and
a
condition
of
the
entire
transaction
was
that
the
internal
revenue
service
would
have
to
render
them
on
opinion
first
that
this
would
be
given
catco
gain
tax
treatment
before
they
would
make
the
transaction.
so
having
paying
their
25%
catco
gain
tax
as
compared
with
52%
ordinary
tax
was
a
real
inducement
to
the
sellers
of
these
leases
to
go
forward
as
well
as
getting
the
money
in
the
early
day.
and
of
course
the
inducement
of
the
texas
eastern
was
it
would
not
trigger
the
“favored
nation”
clauses.
and
so
the
parties
entered
into
an
agreement
for
the
sale
and
purchase
of
the
leases.
now,
texas
eastern
was
very
interested
in
having
continental
oil
company
continue
as
the
one
who
do
the
drilling
and
operation
of
that
field.
the
reason
for
that
was
continental
had
developed
the
field.
there
were
very
high
pressures
in
that
field.
they
were
very
difficult
to
complete
in
and
for
texas
eastern
to
incur
the
cost
of
putting
a
new
organization
there
and
the
risk
which
might
come
from
dealing
with
those
high
pressures
was
out
of
the
question,
so
they
ended
in
to
what
they
call
a
management
contract
in
which
continental
was
implored
as
the
management
agent
of
texas
eastern
to
operate
the
field.
but
no
wells
could
be
drilled
except
those
requested
by
texas
eastern
and
since
the
matter
has
been
closed,
texas
eastern
has
caused
to
be
drilled
five
wells
at
its
cost.
the
amount
of
production
from
that
field
can
only
be
the
amount
of
production
designated
by
texas
eastern.
all
of
the
reworking
of
the
wells,
the
deepening
of
the
wells
can
only
be
done
upon
the
authority
of
texas
eastern,
so
texas
eastern
through
this
management
contract
controls
that
field.
now,
after
the
party
has
entered
into
this
transaction
for
the
purchase
of
the
leases,
they
submitted
with
the
internal
revenue
service
for
rooting
on
the
capital
gains
tax
and
then
they
submitted
to
the
--
in
back
in
1958
to
the
federal
power
commission.
and
the
federal
power
commission
issued
its
opinion
number
322
in
june
1959
and
it
found
this
entire
transaction
to
be
in
accordance
with
public
convenience
and
necessity.
it
pointed
out
in
its
opinion
that
those
customers
of
texas
eastern
and
we
think
this
is
a
rather
important
fact
here,
which
had
opposed
the
purchase
of
gas
by
texas
eastern
on
the
gas
sales
contracts
had
now
withdrawn
their
objections.
they
didn't
object
to
the
lease
purchase
sale
although
they
had
the
objective
vigorously
to
the
purchase
of
natural
gas
under
those
gas
sales
contracts
and
they
didn't
object
to
the
lease
purchase
sale
because
they
knew
the
lease
purchase
sale
would
not
trigger
the
“favored
nation”
clauses
in
the
texas
eastern
contracts
and
thereby
bringing
about
an
increase
to
$10
million
a
year
in
texas
eastern
costly
gas.
and
one
of
those
customers
was
the
petitioner,
united
gas
improvement
company
and
the
hearing
before
the
federal
power
commission
after
this
when
this
matter
was
submitted
to
the
commission,
united
gas
improvement
company
read
a
statement
into
the
record
to
this
effect,
but
this
was
a
step
in
the
right
direction.
what
do
they
mean
by
that?
the
purchase
of
these
leases
by
texas
eastern
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction.
we
favor
this
because
they
meant
this
will
not
trigger
the
“favored
nation”
clause
and
all
of
the
customers,
as
the
commission
found,
withdrew
their
objections
to
the
lease
transactions
although
they
had
oppose
the
purchase
under
gas
sales
contract.
the
only
concern,
the
only
one
it
opposed
it
was
public
service
commission
of
new
york.
now,
in
its
opinion
finding
that
they
had
no
jurisdiction
over
this
matter,
the
commission
went
on
to
say,
it's
important
for
a
pipeline
company
to
own
leases,
it
gives
it
flexibility
of
operations.
they
can
produce
larger
quantities
in
the
winter,
smaller
quantities
in
the
summer
and
that
is
very
much
in
the
interest
of
the
public
and
other
consumers.
texas
eastern
is
enabled
to
treat
this
as
a
storage
field
in
effect
because
it
owns
the
leases.
they
found
of
course
the
price
was
fixed
for
31
years,
the
life
of
the
field.
there
wouldn't
be
escalations
in
the
future
such
as
we
have
had
and
before
the
commission
that
caused
so
many
rate
cases
before
the
commission.
there
was
one
price
that
was
the
price
determined
at
that
time.
no
favored
nations,
no
future
re-determinations
of
price.
so
the
commission
after
setting
out
all
of
those
facts
found
that
an
unconditional
specific
public
convenience
and
necessity
should
issue
to
texas
eastern.
the
public
service
commission
appealed
that
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
d.c.
circuit
by
filing
a
petition
for
review.
one
of
their
main
contentions
was
the
contention
which
is
made
by
mr.
coleman
here
in
this
case.
they
contended
that
the
first,
the
commission
should
not
have
approved
the
terms
of
the
trade
because
there
wasn't
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
cost
of
the
gas
of
texas
eastern.
that's
one
of
the
main
contentions,
so
the
court
of
appeals
says.
when
the
matter
was
decided
for
the
court
of
appeals,
they
recited
the
contentions
of
the
parties.
the
court
of
appeals
clearly
held
that
the
sale
of
leases
was
non-jurisdictional
and
not
subject
to
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
d.c.
circuit
said
that
it
was
error
for
the
commission
to
pass
on
the
price
or
the
acquisition
cost
for
texas
eastern
without
having
substantial
evidence
to
support
them.
so
they
sent
the
case
back
and
we
say
for
a
limited
purpose
and
they
said
to
the
commission,
you
can
do
either
one
of
two
things
you
can
follow
either
alternative.
you
can
clarify
your
former
opinion
by
showing
or
stating
that
price
is
not
approved
here
at
this
term.
now,
if
the
commission
had
done
that
this
litigation
would
have
ended
1961.
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
you
might,
you
can
follow
the
other
alternative,
you
can
reopen
the
record
for
the
purpose
of
permitting
texas
eastern
to
support
its
acquisition
cost
by
evidence.
the
commission
thought
of
that
course
and
in
july
1961,
entered
an
order
which
required
texas
eastern
to
offer
evidence
in
detail
supporting
its
acquisition
cost.
volume
2
of
this
record,
substantial
or
it's
made
up
of
the
evidence
of
texas
eastern
oil,
exhibits
a
detailed
evidence
to
support
the
fact
that
its
cost
--
acquisition
cost
were
reasonable
that
these
acquisition
costs
were
consistent
with
public
convenience
and
necessity.
and
the
commission
after
ordering
texas
eastern
to
offer
this
evidence
and
specify
it
in
detail
what
type
of
evidence
would
be
offered
and
after
the
hearing
was
over
and
the
matter
was
presented
to
the
commission
for
decision,
the
commission
refused
to
pass
on
the
issue
of
cost
despite
the
decision
of
the
d.c.
circuit
and
despite
the
commission's
own
order
of
july
1961
which
directed
texas
eastern
to
offer
evidence
of
cost.
they
said
that
we
have
jurisdiction
over
the
sale
of
these
leases
and
they
further
directed
the
parties
to
resend
this
lease
sale
transaction
retroactively.
and
to
enter
into
gas
sales
contracts
and
submit
them
to
the
commission
because
they
said
we
cannot
adequately
pass
on
the
sale
of
leases.
now,
the
respondents
here
filed
their
petition
for
review
to
the
fifth
circuit
from
that
opinion.
the
fifth
circuit
likewise
held
basing
its
decision
also
on
the
decision
of
this
court
just
as
d.c.
circuit
have
done
in
panhandle
eastern
and
made
it
clear
that
the
commission
had
no
jurisdiction
over
a
lease
sale.
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
said,
“we
will
reverse
this
case
so
that
the
commission
can
reject
the
application,
grant
the
application
or
grant
the
application
conditionally
in
view
of
the
acquisition
cost
of
texas
eastern.”
and
then
the
fifth
circuit
said,
“it
is
with
regret
that
we
note
that
this
is
essentially
what
the
d.c.
circuit
told
the
commission
to
do
three
and
one-half
years
ago.”
so
the
commission
brought
a
petition
for
certiorari
here
and
the
issue
of
cost
has
not
yet
been
passed
on
despite
this
court's
decision
in
catco
which
said
that
it's
one
of
the
prime
considerations
in
a
certificate
case.
we
say
first
that
the
commission
was
bound
by
the
decision
of
the
d.c.
circuit
that
this
was
a
non-jurisdictional
sale,
that
the
reversal
to
the
commission
was
for
a
limited
purpose
that
is
either
write
a
short
opinion
clarifying
this
matter
and
saying
we're
not
approving
price
or
else
receive
evidence
to
support
the
acquisition
cost
of
texas
eastern.
but
instead
of
doing
that
the
commission
had
gone
contrary
to
the
opinion
of
the
d.c.
circuit
and
has
held
it
they
had
jurisdiction.
now,
we
say
that
the
decision
of
the
d.c.
circuit
would
apply
in
the
commission.

position
that
that
decision
that
the
commission
had
no
jurisdictional
dismisses
at
finding.
now,
the
issue
between
us
on
this
point
seems
to
be
this,
they
say
in
their
briefs
although
the
matter
has
not
been
discussed
here
this
morning,
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
actually
decide
that
the
commission
had
no
jurisdiction
over
this
matter
and
if
what
they
said
about
it
was
actually
dictum
and
that
shouldn't
have
been
binding
on
the
commission
that
is
what
we
understand
to
be
the
petitioner's
view
here.
we
say,
they
expressly
said
the
commission
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
this
sale
of
leases,
and
furthermore,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
d.c.
circuit
could
not
erase
the
conclusion
that
they
did
without
deciding
that.
they
couldn't
have
sent
the
matter
back
just
for
the
commission
rather
clarifying
opinion
that
it
was
not
approving
the
price
unless
they
thereby
held
that
the
commission
had
no
jurisdiction
over
this
lease
sale
that
was
impertinent.
or
they
couldn't
have
sent
it
back
just
for
the
purpose
we
submit
of
taking
evidence
on
the
acquisition
cost
unless
--
of
texas
eastern
unless
they
thereby
had
not
held
that
the
commission
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
these
leases.
further,
we
say,
that
there's
no
statutory
or
there's
no
gap
here.
that
is
of
course
a
usual
argument
made
by
the
commission
when
it
seeks
to
extend
this
jurisdiction.
they
have
made
that
argument
before
the
congress
that
unless
they
had
control
over
direct
sales
they
would
be
an
attractive
gap.
they
have
made
that
argument
here.
since
panhandle
eastern
was
decided
in
13
or
14
years,
the
commission
in
its
annual
reports
to
the
congress
has
asked
congress
to
give
it
jurisdiction
over
the
lease
sales
by
the
natural
gas
company.
so
far,
despite
those
13
requests,
congress
has
not
done
so.
and
the
only
year
that
the
commission
did
not
request
that
it
be
given
jurisdiction
over
lease
sales
was
the
year
they
rendered
their
decision
which
is
now
on
review
in
1963.
but
then
they
told
congress
in
their
annual
report
that
they
had
made
a
policy
decision
to
take
jurisdiction
over
lease
sales.
we
say
a
policy
decision
is
for
the
congress
and
not
for
the
commission.
now,
although,
we
say
that
there
is
no
gap
here
because
you
have
two
courts
of
appeals
which
you
told
the
federal
power
commission,
you
can
pass
on
these
acquisition
costs.
and
furthermore,
we
have
the
order
of
the
federal
power
commission
which
it
entered
upon
the
reversal
in
the
d.c.
circuit.
and
which
have
stated
to
carry
the
evidence
to
be
offered
by
texas
eastern
and
we
say
they
in
effect
converted
this
certificate
case
after
it
was
reversed
by
the
d.c.
circuit
into
a
rate
case
by
reason
of
the
character
evidence
which
texas
eastern
required
to
offer.

and
then
fourth
and
finally,
a
study,
cost
of
service
study
showing
the
cost
of
making
the
natural
gas
from
the
rayne
field
available
to
the
texas
eastern
system
and
then
they
said
you
must
include
every
cost
which
will
be
associated
with
making
this
rayne
gas
available
to
the
texas
eastern
system
for
the
life
of
the
field
just
as
an
all
cost
that
texas
eastern
would
not
claim
in
subsequent
rate
cases
where
you
have
the
question
as
to
whether
rate
or
the
cost
is
just
unreasonable.
now,
in
view
of
that
requirement
on
texas
eastern
to
come
forward
with
that
character
evidence,
we
say
that
the
consumer
was
assured
that
the
acquisition
of
cost
of
texas
eastern
would
be
passed
on
in
this
certificate
case.
here
was
detailed
evidence
required.
texas
eastern
complied
with
that
order
volume
2
contains
all
of
these
evidence
in
regard
to
this
cost
evidence
and
the
commission
was
thereby
enabled
to
pass
on
the
acquisition
cost
but
have
to
order
texas
eastern
to
produce
this
evidence,
they
have
refused
to
pass
on
it
up
to
this
time
but
instead
said
well
we
rather
have
jurisdiction
over
the
sale
of
those
leases.
now,
we
say
that
there
can
be
no
gap
as
long
as
the
commission
can
require
in
a
certificate
case
such
as
done
here
with
this
extensive
evidence
to
be
offered.
the
commission
is
enabled
to
pass
on
the
acquisition
cost
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
are
reasonable.
and
thereby
determine
whether
a
certificate
should
be
granted.
and
as
the
fifth
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
not
the
same
standard
as
this
court
said
in
catco.
not
the
just
and
reasonable
standard
they
passed
on
the
rate
case,
no
sir
i
consider.
but
i
say
they
certainly
have
to
look
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
cause
not
to
determine
that
they're
just
and
reasonable
as
those
words
of
art
are
used
in
rate
cases.
but
they
can
certainly
determine
as
this
court
said
in
catco
whether
or
not
those
acquisition
cost
are
consistent
with
public
convenience
and
necessity.
and
i
think
that
gives
a
broad
ground
for
the
commission
to
pass
on
the
matter
in
determining
whether
it's
in
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
that
those
costs
be
paid
by
texas
eastern
but
that
is
not
to
your
honor,
mr.
justice
white,
certainly
the
same
standard
that
would
be
applied
in
the
rate
case.
mr.
david
t.
searls
they
could
have
fix
the
price
and
as
the
fifth
circuit
said
your
honor,
you
should
determine
whether
you're
going
to
reject
this
application,
whether
you're
going
to
grant
or
whether
you're
going
to
grant
it
conditionally
and
the
right
to
the
impose
reasonable
conditions
certainly
gives
the
commission
considerable
control
over
the
matter.
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
certainly
do.
to
purchase
price
which
they
would
stay
at
this
condition
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
in
the
certificate
case.
they
must
eventually
get
a
certificate
and
of
course
they
must
bill
certain
facilities
in
order
to
connect
the
leases
with
their
pipeline.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes
sir
i
think
that
would
always
be
true.
i
can't
conceive
of
a
situation
where
some
time
they're
not
going
to
have
to
build
facilities
to
connect
that
gas
reserve
even
if
it's
installing
a
barrel
or
some
certain
line.
i
mean
the
commission
goes
long
ways
of
acquiring
these
pipelines
to
get
authorization
before
they
can
install
in
the
facilities.
so
i
say
somewhere
down
the
line,
they
must
do
that.
now,
it
so
happens
mr.
justice
white
in
this
case
a
condition
with
this
entire
transaction
was
that
texas
eastern
would
obtain
a
certificate
from
the
federal
power
commission.
that
was
a
condition
of
the
transaction.
but
even
if
that
hadn't
been
the
condition
i
say
at
some
time
there'll
have
to
be
a
certificate
case
in
which
that
could
be
passed
on.
now,
if
it's
conceivable
that
that's
not
true,
that
doesn't
mean
the
matter
could
not
be
passed
on
at
a
later
time
if
that
is
not
made
an
issue
in
a
certificate
case.
mr.
david
t.
searls
no,
your
honor
we
haven't,
we
did
have.
we
obtained
one
in
1959
in
june
1959
and
then
the
matter
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
d.c.
circuit
and
so
we
find
ourselves
in
this
clamor.
mr.
david
t.
searls
texas
eastern
is
taking
gas
from
the
rayne
field.
mr.
david
t.
searls
the
connection
has
been
made
and
course
the
certificate
application
applies
not
only
to
construction
but
also
for
future
operation
of
the
facilities
and
so
texas
is
in
still
much
have
a
certificate.
now,
we
could
not
abandon
this
service,
of
course
without
going
for
the
federal
power
commission
under
the
natural
gas
act
and
filing
a
petition
for
abandonment.
and
so,
we
have
taken
no
action
pending
a
determination
of
the
matter.
mr.
david
t.
searls
do
you
mean
why
they
should
determine
it
in
a
certificate
case?
mr.
david
t.
searls
why
we
want
them
to
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes,
i'm
appearing
here
for
all
of
them,
yes.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes,
well
now
if
--
assuming
they
made
gas
sales
contracts
say
for
instance.
the
seller
respondents
would
have
to
come
in
with
an
application
for
public
means
and
necessity.
now,
the
public
service
commission
in
new
york
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
it
wouldn't
end
up.
it
wouldn't
end
up
the
same
result,
no.
here
--
here
--
here's
what
i'd
say
be
the
difference.
just
as
the
united
gas
improvement
has
already
here
this
afternoon
and
just
as
the
public
service
commission
has
argued,
they
say
that
if
the
producers
were
in
here
or
the
sellers
of
these
leases,
we
would
then
go
into
the
cost
incurred
by
the
sellers
for
those
reasons.
we
determine
what
their
cost
are
and
we
would
allow
them
only
a
rate
of
return
on
those
costs
and
we
don't
think
that
where
you're
passing
on
the
acquisition
cost
that
you
would
investigate
the
cost
incurred
by
the
sellers
in
buying
the
leases,
in
exploring
that
the
leases.
and
so,
the
difference
is
and
i
would
say
that
would
be
the
difference
that
under
the
contentions
by
the
petitioners,
if
the
producers
were
in
here
and
that's
what
the
federal
power
commission
wants.
they
say
just
the
federal
power
commission
makes
the
same
statement
that
the
solicitor
general
made
in
his
lucid
argument
this
morning.
and
that
is
the
need
for
the
protection
of
consumer
is
just
as
great
when
the
leases
are
purchased
at
when
gas
is
acquired.
so
they
say
that
when
you're
buying,
both
should
be
subject
to
control
over
the
commission
and
the
commission
says
they
would
have
greater
control
over
the
matter.
they
could
go
on
to
question
the
cost
of
these
produces.
and
i
would
say
that
the
sellers
of
these
leases
do
not
think
first
that
their
cost
should
be
investigated
in
selling
these
leases,
that
they
should
be
allowed
only
what
might
be
determined
to
be
a
reasonable
term
on
the
cost
of
these
leases
whenever
explored
for
natural
gas
and
drilled
wells.
mr.
david
t.
searls
well,
they
could
determine
this,
mr.
justice
white.
they
could
look
to
the
first,
the
cost,
acquisition
cost
of
texas
eastern.
then
they
could
look
to
what
are
the
other
costs
of
gas
the
texas
eastern
of
comparable
quantities.
how
does
this
compare
with
other
acquisitions?
mr.
david
t.
searls
well,
they
would
look
to
market
criteria
and
that'd
be
the
primary
consideration.
they
would
look
to
market
criteria
where
the
commission,
for
instance,
has
authorized
certificates
at
various
prices.
and
what
would
be
the
cost
of
texas
eastern
as
compared
with
obtaining
equivalent
quantities
of
gas.
that
would
determine
whether
or
not
this
is
a
provident
and
reasonable
investment
on
the
part
of
texas
eastern,
whether
it
be
consistent
with
federal
convenience
and
necessity.
they
could
look
to
all
other
reserves.
they
could
determine
whether
the
reserves
are
properly
determined.
they
could
look
to
determine
what
are
all
the
costs
texas
eastern
will
acquire
in
making
this
gas
available
to
its
system
and
they
could
compare
the
gathering
cost
with
gathering
costs
in
other
areas.
it
gives
the
commission
considerable
control
over
the
acquisition
cost.
and
i
say
they
can
go
to
all
of
the
cost
that
this
court
had
in
mind
when
it
decided
catco.
and
that
is
any
cost
that
bears
upon
public
convenience
and
necessity
and
as
the
court
said,
speaking
to
mr.
justice
clark,
prices
in
important
consideration,
and
in
a
certificate
case,
you
can
determine
whether
those
costs
are
consistent
with
public
convenience
and
necessity
which
is
rather
a
broad
term.
and
any
cost
that
would
fall
in
that
category,
i
say,
could
be
examined
in
the
certificate
case.
now,
we
say
that
this
natural
gas
act
is
not
actually
here.
because
congress
was
very
careful
not
to
use
its
full
commerce
clause
power
to
its
limits
in
giving
the
federal
power
commission
jurisdiction
here.
first,
it
gave
the
federal
power
commission,
jurisdiction
over
only
sales
in
natural
gas.
second,
it
gave
it
jurisdiction
over
only
sales
in
interstate
commerce.
and
we
think
that
is
a
restrictive
term
as
the
court
has
repeatedly
recognized.
it
didn't
say,
we'll
give
you
jurisdiction
over
all
those
activities
which
may
affect
interstate
commerce
or
promote
interstate
commerce
or
restrain
interstate
commerce.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes,
sir
in
the
certificate
case.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes,
i
do,
your
honor,
now
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes,
but
here's
a
way
i'd
had
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
no,
its
acquisition
of
the
lease
is
not
subject
to
regulation.
the
procuring
of
the
natural
gas
is
not
subject
to
regulation.
but
in
passing
on
the
question
whether
it
will
authorize
the
facilities,
it
can
look
to
the
cost
of
the
natural
gas.
so,
you
could
say
indirectly
the
commission
does
pass
on
it.
now,
just
like
in
catco
where
if
a
producer
applies
for
an
application
for
--
to
sell
gas
in
passing
on
that
certificate,
the
commission
might
impose
a
condition
that
we
authorize
this
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity,
conditioned
upon
the
price
being
deduced
to
blank
sentence.
mr.
david
t.
searls
well,
the
between
us
and
the
government
is
we
say
that
the
commission
cannot
take
jurisdiction
over
the
producers
or
the
sellers
of
these
leases.
mr.
david
t.
searls
in
the
texas
eastern
rate
base?
mr.
david
t.
searls
oh
yes
sir,
i
think
they
have
your
honor.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes.
i
think
they
could
impose
a
condition
here
that
texas
eastern
will
be
allowed
in
its
rate
base
on
a
blank
percent
of
the
acquisition
cost
in
the
certificate
case.
i
think
they
could
do
that
in
the
certificate
case.
in
authorizing
texas
eastern
to
build
facilities
which
are
based
upon
this
acquisition,
they
could
provide
that
this
certificate
is
granted,
conditioned
upon
texas
eastern
accepting
this
condition
that
it
will
be
allowed
only
blank
dollars
in
its
rate
base.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes,
i
do.
in
passing
on
an
application
for
a
certificate
on
public
convenience
and
necessity
that
they
can
determine
all
factors
that
bear
on
a
public
convenience
and
necessity.
now,
if
it's
in
public
interest,
if
the
commission
decides
that
this
is
an
improvident
purchase
by
texas
eastern
to
the
extent
of
blank
dollars,
then
i'll
say,
in
granting
a
certificate
for
public
convenience
and
necessity,
they
could
impose
a
condition
that
the
amount
which
would
be
allowed
in
texas
eastern
rate
base
will
be
so
much.
mr.
david
t.
searls
it's
--
no
it's
their
power
under
this
section
7
(c)
of
the
natural
gas
act
to
issue
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
necessity.
in
other
words,
they
must
decide
in
the
certificate
case
what
is
consistent
with
public
convenience
and
necessity?
that's
a
very
broad
power.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes,
i
don't
think
production
and
gathering
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
this
is
the
pipeline
phase
of
it.
the
exemption
as
to
production
and
gathering
means
that
the
lease
sale
falls
within
the
production
and
gathering
exemption,
and
therefore
the
transaction
is
non-jurisdictional.
now,
for
instance,
your
honor,
you
will
recall
the
consolidated
edison
case
decided
by
this
court
about
1960,
in
which
certain
producers
in
southwest
texas
made
direct
sales
from
consolidated
edison
company
in
new
york.
and
in
determining
whether
not
you
would
grant
the
transcontinental
gas
pipeline
corporation
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
transport
that
gas,
this
court
held
that
price
was
a
very
important
consideration,
being
received
by
those
producers.
even
though
all
parties
admitted
those
direct
sales
were
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission
because
they
were
direct
sales
and
not
sales
for
resale.
but
in
passing
on
this
issue
of
granting
a
certificate
to
the
pipeline
company
to
transport
the
gas,
the
court
held
you
could
determine
what
affect
the
price
received
by
the
producers
would
have
in
that
area
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
grant
a
certificate
to
the
pipeline
company.
mr.
david
t.
searls
we
say
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes.
well,
i'd
say
the
practical
difference
is
that
you
cannot
investigate
the
cost
of
the
owners
of
these
leases,
the
former
owners
of
these
leases
in
this
certificate
case.
the
government
and
mr.
coleman
had
just
argued,
the
public
service
commission
of
new
york
has
argued,
you
should
go
in
to
the
cost
of
these
producers.
you
should
fix
the
price
to
be
paid
texas
eastern
by
reason
of
the
cost
to
these
producers
and
if
you
take
jurisdiction
over
these
sellers
of
the
leases
and
pass
on
what
cost
they're
entitled
to
receive
that
is
important
here.
we
say
you
cannot
go
into
the
cost
of
the
sellers
of
the
leases.
mr.
david
t.
searls
if
the
commission
decides
that
$900,000
is
not
a
prudent
investment,
it's
improvident,
they
could
limit
until
$100,000.
mr.
david
t.
searls
and
you
could
not
--
and
you
could
make
that
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
think
it
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
well
they
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
of
course
a
pipeline
company
must
make
a
private
investment
in
steel
pipe
running
into
millions
of
dollars
or
it
might
be
disallowed
in
a
rate
base.
but
here
in
this
case,
texas
eastern
has
provided
that
the
granting
of
this
certificate,
this
transaction
is
conditioned
upon
it
obtaining
a
certificate
which
is
acceptable
to
it.
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
think
it
can
mr.
justice
goldberg
as
i
mentioned.
it
can
go
into
the
question
of
what
does
it
cost
texas
eastern
to
obtain
another
comparable
supply
of
gas
at
this
point.
now,
we
have
offered
substantial
evidence
as
to
what
other
comparable
supplies
of
gas
which
have
been
certificated
by
the
commission
or
costing
texas
eastern
at
the
opelousas,
louisiana.
we
proved
that.
we
proved
this
is
a
better
deal
than
other
purchases
which
have
been
certificated
or
other
--
and
so,
we
have
offered
extensive
evidence
which
is
summarized
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
to
establish
that
the
cost
incurred
by
texas
eastern
here
are
consistent
with
public
convenience
and
necessity.
as
i
say,
we're
around
section
1
(b)
which
is
the
jurisdictional
section
of
the
natural
gas
act
to
establish
that
this
is
not
a
sale
of
natural
gas
first
and
second
it's
not
a
sale
in
interstate
commerce,
and
that
congress
carefully
did
not
used
its
full
or
power
under
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution.
where
it
congress
has
intended
to
reach
those
transactions
which
may
affect
interstate
commerce
or
promote
interstate
commerce
or
restrain
interstate
commerce,
it
has
been
very
explicit
so
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
repeatedly
said,
in
the
legislation
to
show
that
it
is
reaching
transactions
which
may
affect
interstate
commerce.
now,
petitioners
argue
here.
well,
when
you
acquire
these
developed
leases
that
has
an
economic
effect
upon
your
rates
and
upon
the
consumers,
that's
true
with
any
leases
which
a
pipeline
company
may
acquire.
there's
just
a
difference
in
degree.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes
sir?
mr.
david
t.
searls
mr.
justice
white
i
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
would
be
concerned
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
of
course,
i
don't
know
what
the
price
of
gas
would
be
if
the
commission
should
win,
but
i
would
be
concerned
that
if
they
went
into
sellers
cost,
they
would
reduce
the
price
to
be
received
or
the
consideration
to
be
received
by
the
sellers
below
the
cost
which
it's
now
receiving.
mr.
david
t.
searls
well,
it's
--
i'm
not
willing
that
you
go
that
far,
but
certainly
we
are
concerned
about
the
consideration
about
these
sellers
getting
that
consideration
and
texas
eastern
thinks
it's
made
a
good
deal.
it
thinks
this
consideration
is
inline
that
it's
a
better
deal
than
it
may
have
been
buying
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
it
would
not
come
out
with
the
same
answer
because
it
would
have
a
different
approach
to
the
problem
if
it
were
investigating
the
costs
of
the
producers.
but
i
say
that
if
--
when
you
follow
their
order
as
to
character
evidence
texas
eastern
was
required
to
produce
and
when
you
look
to
summary
of
the
evidence
which
we
did
produce
as
shown
in
the
appendix
to
this
brief,
you
can
see
that
substantial
evidence
was
offered
to
support
texas
eastern's
acquisition
cost.
mr.
david
t.
searls
well,
we
don't
think
an
area
price
approach
should
be
applied
here.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes,
if
they
tried
to
apply
area
price
approach,
we
do
not
think
they
could
be
applied
in
this
case.
mr.
david
t.
searls
well,
we
don't
think
in
passing
on
the
pipeline
company's
acquisition
cost,
determine
whether
there
was
a
prudent
investment
whether
it
was
properly
made
that
you
could
look
just
to
merely
the
price,
because
that
would
not
be
necessarily
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
it
actually
be
higher
than
the
price
here.
our
position
is
it
would
fall
about
higher
price
in
here.
because
we
say
here,
in
this
case,
if
the
price
was
17.15
and
in
addition
texas
eastern
has
to
receive
$9
million
from
liquids.
now,
the
solicitor
general
was
in
error
in
saying
that
if
the
production
payment
was
reserved
in
all
the
gas
liquids,
that
production
payment
is
extinguished
after
75%
of
the
gas
had
been
produced,
and
is
estimated
that
texas
eastern
will
obtain
$9
million
which
will
reduce
its
acquisition
cost
to
16.57
per
mcf.
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
think
to
the
character
evidence
that
they
require
to
be
produced
in
this
case
along
that
line.
it
could
not
go
into
the
cost
of
the
seller,
no
sir.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
david
t.
searls
well,
mr.
justice
black
i'd
have
to
say
that
in
passing
on
whether
or
not
the
pipeline
companies
made
a
prudent
investment
and
provident
investment
and
improvident
investment,
it's
immaterial
how
much
profit
the
sellers
are
making
out
of
transaction.
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
think
you'd
have
to
say
will
what
it
would
have
to
pay
to
get
other
profits
like
that.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes,
i'd
have
to
say
that
whatever
profit
the
sellers
are
making
out
of
transaction
is
not
material
and
determined
whether
the
acquisition
cost
of
texas
eastern
are
consistent
with
public
convenience
and
necessity.
mr.
david
t.
searls
what
are
the
leases
so
far,
i
think
that
would
be
material.
mr.
david
t.
searls
i
think
it
would
mr.
justice
black,
that's
the
character
evidence
we
offer.
we
offer
to
prove
what
gas
was
costing
other
pipeline
companies
at
this
point.
we
offer
to
prove
what
we
--
what
it
caused
us
to
acquire
comparable
reserves
of
natural
gas
in
order
to
establish
that
this
was
a
prudent
and
provident
investment
by
texas
eastern.
now,
we
say
that
whether
not
being
made
50%
percent
profit
or
100%
profit,
in
the
sale
of
the
leases
is
immaterial.
mr.
david
t.
searls
well,
i
think
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes.
mr.
david
t.
searls
well,
i
don't
believe
that
the
profit
that
the
sellers
are
making
wouldn't
be
material
in
determining
whether
i
am
making
a
prudent
investment.
in
other
words,
one
seller
might
have
bought
a
high
cost
leasse.
another
seller
might
have
bought
a
“wildcat”
lease
and
he's
making
a
large
profit,
but
yet
both
of
them
sell
their
leases
at
the
same
price.
now
i
say
texas,
eastern
can
make
a
provident
and
prudent
investment
in
buying
both
of
those
leases
even
though
one
of
them
makes
5%
percent
profit
and
the
other
one
makes
500%
profit.
mr.
david
t.
searls
well,
if
you
went
into
that
store
and
that
party
had
that
product
on
the
shelves
about
five
years,
it
might
make
a
large
profit,
or
as
it
might
have
the
same
product
that
he
bought
six
months
ago
and
the
price
is
going
up.
mr.
david
t.
searls
yes
sir.
well,
i
don't
believe,
and
it's
my
position
that
the
profit
being
made
by
the
sellers
has
any
materiality
in
determining
whether
the
pipeline
company
is
making
prudent
and
provident
investment.
that
you
look
to
see
what
is
going
to
cause
it
that
is
a
pipeline
company
to
require
comparable
reserves
on
natural
gas,
that's
one
of
the
material
consideration.
mr.
david
t.
searls
the
reasonableness
of
the
purchase
price
and
not
the
reasonableness
of
the
sale
price.
as
i
was
saying,
the
petitioners
have
contended
here
that
there
will
be
an
economic
affect
upon
interstate
commerce
or
upon
the
consumers
if
a
raise
in
the
price
which
is
paid
by
texas
eastern
for
the
acquisition
of
leases,
and
since
it
has
some
economic
effect,
you
should
treat
it
just
like
you
treat
a
sale
of
natural
gas
at
the
mouth
of
the
interstate
pipeline
company.
but
that's
not
what
congress
said,
congress
said,
it's
only
at
the
sale
is
made
in
interstate
commerce
and
only
if
it
is
a
sale
of
natural
gas.
now,
this
court
in
1949
has
said
in
the
panhandle
eastern
case,
an
attempt
has
been
made
here
to
distinguish
that
case.
and
as
i
understand
the
basis
for
the
argument
it's
this,
the
court
in
the
panhandle
eastern
case
said,
well
there's,
that
instead
of
the
fact
that
transfer
was
made
of
undeveloped
leases.
but
i
want
to
call
to
your
honors
attention
that
in
panhandle
eastern,
there
was
evidence
offered
as
to
the
exact
amount
of
gas
underlying
those
leases.
those
leases
where
located
in
the
middle
of
the
hugon
field,
the
largest
natural
gas
field
in
the
united
states,
extending
to
the
panhandle
of
texas
to
the
panhandle
of
oklahoma
and
into
kansas.
yet
it
was
possible
for
the
geologists
to
estimate
that
there
were
700
billion
cubic
feet
underlying
those
leases
and
that
was
the
testimony
in
this
case,
and
this
court
referred
to
the
fact.
now,
when
the
court
said
undeveloped
leases,
i
assume
that
the
court
meant
that
the
leases
had
not
been
fully
developed
and
not
been
connected
with
an
interstate
pipeline
company.
likewise,
the
leases
is
involved
here
were
not
fully
developed.
texas
eastern
has
drilled
at
its
own
cost
and
expense
and
not
reimbursed
to
many
source,
five
wells
below
10,000
feet
since
it
has
acquired
these
leases
and
plans
to
drill
two
more
wells
as
the
record
discloses
in
this
case.
so
the
leases
here
weren't
fully
developed.
but
that's
immaterial,
the
fact
is
the
leases
were
been
proved
up
in
that
case
and
was
able
to
estimate
that
there
was
involved
there
700
billion
cubic
feet
of
natural
gas.
furthermore,
in
this
case
in
the
panhandle
case
and
quite
a
point
are
made
--
was
made
by
this
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
panhandle,
that
three
certificates
have
been
issued
to
panhandle
eastern
based
up
on
those
oil
and
gas
leases
which
were
involved
in
that
case.
but
those
leases
in
panhandle
had
been
included
in
their
rate
base
and
that
the
interstate
rate
pair
consumer
had
been
paying
the
expense
cost
and
development
cost
and
another
expenses
in
connection
with
maintaining
those
leases.
in
the
present
case,
those
conditions
do
not
exist,
we
say
that
there
was
more
reason
to
hold
that
those
--
that
sale
jurisdiction
and
there
is
to
hold
that
this
sale
is
of
jurisdiction.
these
leases
had
not
been
dedicated.
mr.
david
t.
searls
well,
of
course,
in
panhandle,
they
have
an
account
of
production
and
gathering
reception,
that
the
sale
of
those
leases
was
non-jurisdiction
because
the
natural
gas
act
provides
that
should
not
apply
to
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
the
pass
on
acquisition
cost
because
i
think
the
commission
can
always
pass
on
the
acquisition
cost
of
the
pipeline
company,
in
a
certificate
case
whether
it's
natural
gas,
pipe,
valves
or
what
it
might
be.
mr.
david
t.
searls
and
because
its
power
to
issue
to
a
certificate
a
public
convenience
and
necessity,
i
say
that
the
--
the
commission
in
deciding
whether
to
issue
a
public
convenience
and
necessity
can
pass
on
any
acquisition
cost
that
are
involved
in
that
certificate
case.
and
when
the
certificate
case
is
based
upon
the
acquisition
of
leases,
is
based
upon
the
acquisition
of
pipes,
is
based
upon
the
acquisition
of
compressors
and
pumps,
the
commission
can
investigate
all
of
those
costs
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
pipeline
company
made
of
provident
and
prudent
investment
in
that
certificate
case.
because
as
mr.
justice
douglas
suggests,
those
cost
are
going
to
go
into
the
rate
base
of
that
pipeline
company.
and
i
think
in
that
certificate
case,
they
can
do
it,
so
therefore
that's
why
i
say
that
even
that
pan
am
does
not
deprive
a
pipeline
company
purchasing
facilities,
whether
it's
natural
gas
leases
or
whether
its
pipe
depends
on
whether
it's
a
prudent
on
investment.
mr.
david
t.
searls
it
would
be
passing
along
the
--
well
i
have
to
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
well,
i
have
to
say
that
the
commission
has
no
--
mr.
david
t.
searls
i'm
not
--
i
don't
want
to
perceive
it
because
the
commission
has
no
authority
to
pass
from
the
cost
of,
i
cannot
pass
upon
the
acquisition
of
release,
but
we
have
to
recognize
that
indirectly,
concerning
a
certificate
to
construct
certain
facilities,
i
think
the
commission
is
passing
on
the
acquisition
by
indirect
trial.
and
i
think
that's
been
done
although
the
commission
did
not
have
the
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
that
acquisition
leases
as
know
you,
when
the
natural
gas
act
was
pending
as
a
bill
before
the
congress.
there
was
another
bill
pending
there,
which
would
have
given
the
commission
jurisdiction
all
of
the
procurement
of
natural
gas
by
a
pipeline
company.
and
that
bill
was
not
passed
for
the
congress
which
was
given
jurisdiction
over
the
procurement
of
natural
gas.
so
the
history
of
the
natural
gas
act
as
developed
in
the
footnotes
of
the
panhandle
eastern
discloses,
and
it
passed
the
bill
which
gave
them
jurisdiction
only
over
the
sale
of
natural
gas
any
sale
in
interstate
commerce.
we
say
that
this
was
not
a
sale
of
natural
gas,
not
a
sale
of
interstate
commerce,
and
aside
from
that
section
1
(b)
expressly
provides
that
it
would
not
apply
to
any
other
sale
and
all
supervise
of
course
it
would
not
apply
to
the
production
and
gathering
of
natural
gas.
mr.
david
t.
searls
that's
correct.
mr.
david
t.
searls
that's
exactly
our
position
and
we
say
that
the
commission
cannot
only
do
that
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
the
rate
case
but
they
can
do
that
in
the
certificate
case.
but
they
can't
determine
what
profit
the
united
states
still
is
making
for
these
hundred
million
dollars
of
pipe
that
it
sells
to
the
pipeline
company,
can't
go
into
those
costs
or
what
profit
it's
making.
but
it
can
determine
in
view
of
other
costs
which
would
be
incurred
in
buying
other
pipes
and
so
forth,
whether
or
not
the
pipeline
company
is
incurring
it
probably,
they're
making
a
provident
investment
or
an
improvident
investment
in
buying
that
pipe,
one
of
those
compressors
this
case
might
be.
now
we
--
we
say
that
the
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
to
over
these
sellers
of
these
leases
but
they
will
beat
no
gap
because
this
right
to
pass
on
the
acquisition
cost
will
adequately
protect
the
consumers,
wasn't
it?
mr.
david
t.
searls
on
behalf
of
the
seller,
well,
i
represent
them,
too
here,
you
know?
mr.
david
t.
searls
well,
the
pipeline
company
made
a
deal
here
and
you'd
think
it
made
a
good
deal
and
it
wants
to
go
forward
with
this
deal
that
which
is
made
back
in
1958,
and
it's
been
trying
for
a
number
of
years
to
have
this
mater
finally
determined.
and
it
thinks
it
made
a
better
deal
here
by
buying
to
get
a
large
reserve
of
gas
if
trade
in
cubic
feet
located
just
22
miles
from
its
main
line.
therefore,
it
will
incur
low
gathering
cost
in
bringing
that
gas
to
its
line.
this
was
the
best
located
larger
reserve
of
natural
gas
which
could
have
been
acquired
by
texas
eastern.
mr.
david
t.
searls
if
it's
not,
i
say,
there
have
to
be
a
certificate.
they
don't
have
to
build
certain
facilities
that
will
deprive
them
to
get
a
certificate.
but
if
it's
not
sever
to
the
scrutiny
in
a
certificate
case,
if
that's
not
made
on
issue.
it's
certain
going
to
be
subject
to
the
scrutiny
in
a
rate
case
and
problem
with
rates
of
texas
eastern
as
whether
or
not
they're
just
and
reasonable.
