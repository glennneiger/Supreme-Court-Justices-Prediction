mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
to
review
a
decision
setting
aside
an
order
of
the
federal
power
commission
made
under
the
natural
gas
act.
the
case
is
one
of
great
importance
because
if
that
decision
stands,
it
opens
what
we
conceive
to
be
a
very
serious
gap
in
the
power
of
the
commission
to
regulate
prices
at
which
produces
sell
gas
to
pipelines
under
the
phillips
petroleum
case.
the
essential
facts
are
these,
texas
eastern
is
an
interstate
pipeline
company
with
a
system
running
from
south
texas
up
to
northeast
through
philadelphia
and
on
to
the
new
york
area.
the
other
respondents
in
this
case
are
oil
and
gas
producers
who
held
leases
in
the
rayne
field
in
louisiana.
early
in
1957,
the
respondent
producers,
agreed
to
deliver
gas
in
the
rayne
field,
texas
eastern
at
the
initial
price
of
$23.59
per
thousand
cubic
feet
over
a
period
of
what
would
probably
be
about
20
years.
texas
eastern
then
applied
for
certificates
to
construct
the
necessary
facility.
under
the
phillips
petroleum
case,
the
federal
power
commission
clearly
had
jurisdiction
not
only
over
the
construction
of
the
facilities,
but
also
over
the
agreement
to
sell
the
gas
in
the
price
at
which
it
was
sold.
at
this
point,
the
third
circuit
rendered
a
decision
in
the
catco
case
which
later
came
before
this
court
which
made
it
apparent
that
the
commission
could
not
approve
the
sale
by
these
respondent
producers
to
this
pipeline
company
because
this
sale
was
at
a
price
a
cent-and-a-half
higher
than
the
sale
which
had
been
sale
price
that
have
been
disapproved
by
the
third
circuit
in
catco.
the
respondents
then
cancelled
their
agreement
to
sell
the
gas
and
recast
the
deal
in
the
form
that
it
is
now
before
the
court.
as
in
the
form
that
it
is
now
before
the
court,
the
respondent
producers
conveyed
to
a
newly
created
subsidiary
of
texas
eastern.
their
leasehold
rights
to
gas
in
the
rayne
field
down
to
a
specified
depth
together
with
wells
and
related
equipment.
reserving,
it's
important
to
emphasize
is
the
so-called
production
payment
all
the
condensates
that
could
be
extracted
from
the
gas
as
it
came
from
the
ground.
this
new
subsidiary
then
assigned
its
rights
under
the
leases
to
texas
eastern.
texas
eastern
retained
the
respondent
continental
which
had
been
operating
the
field
for
the
benefit
of
all
the
producers,
under
a
management
agreement
to
continue
to
operate
the
field,
extracting
the
gas
from
the
ground
and
ultimately
delivering
it
to
texas
eastern.
the
consideration
for
the
lease
was
$134
million
about
9%
payable
in
cash
and
the
rest
are
paid
in
notes
of
the
subsidiary
which
fell
due
periodically
through
the
expected
life
of
the
gas
field.
texas
eastern
assumed
no
contractual
liability
and
the
subsidiary
had
no
other
assets
beyond
the
lease
that
it
assigned.
texas
eastern
then
went
back
to
the
federal
power
commission
for
certification
of
the
construction
of
the
necessary
facilities.
at
that
stage,
it
was
june
1959,
the
commission
assumed
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction
over
this
lease
transaction
and
issued
the
necessary
certificates.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
on
review
set
aside
the
commission's
order
upon
the
ground
that
the
commission
might
either
go
into
the
price
at
which
the
gas
was
transferred
or
the
cost
of
the
gas
to
texas
eastern,
or
it
might
state
clearly
then
entirely
but
that
it
had
heard
and
indicating
in
the
course
of
its
opinion
that
the
price
or
cost
was
in
the
public
interest
without
sufficient
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
that.
and
i
should
say
that
in
the
course
of
its
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
also
assume
that
the
commission
had
no
jurisdiction
over
these
transactions
as
such.
upon
remand,
the
commission
reopened
the
entire
matter.
it
then
decided
contrary
to
its
early
assumption
and
contrary
to
the
assumption
of
the
circuit
court
that
the
lease
sale
transaction
was
itself
within
the
commission's
jurisdiction
as
a
sale
in
interstate
commerce
of
natural
gas
for
resale
and
ultimate
public
consumption.
on
review,
the
fifth
circuit
set
aside
the
commission's
order
holding
that
since
the
transaction
involved
a
lease
of
mineral
rights,
it
constituted
production
and
gathering
and
was
not
a
sale
in
interstate
commerce
of
natural
gas
for
resale.
we
then
brought
the
case
here
adjoined
by
one
of
the
distributing
companies
in
philadelphia
area
represented
by
mr.
coleman
and
the
question
very
simply
is
whether
the
commission
was
right
in
holding
that
it
had
jurisdiction
or
whether
the
fifth
circuit
was
right
in
holding
that
it
had
not.
the
case
turns
on
section
1
(b)
of
the
natural
gas
act
which
is
printed
on
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief.
it
gives
the
commission
jurisdiction
over
the
transportation
of
natural
gas
in
interstate
commerce
and
more
importantly
over
the
sale
in
interstate
commerce
of
natural
gas
for
resale
for
ultimate
public
consumption.
but
it
excludes
the
production
and
gathering
or
production
or
gathering
of
natural
gas.
the
term
sale
in
interstate
commerce
of
natural
gas
and
production
for
gathering
are
used
in
contradistinction
as
this
court
held
in
the
interstate
case
in
the
phillips
petroleum
case.
if
a
transaction
involves
a
sale
of
natural
gas
in
interstate
commerce,
then
that
part
of
the
transaction
at
least
is
not
production
of
the
gathering
and
therefore
not
excluded
from
the
commission's
jurisdiction.
consequently,
we
can
concentrate
here
on
the
question
whether
these
transactions,
this
lease
sale
transaction
that
i
described
constitutes
a
sale
in
interstate
commerce
of
natural
gas
for
resale.
and
the
starting
point
of
course
in
inquiring
into
that
question
is
the
settled
premise
to
their
producer's
agreement
to
sell
and
deliver
natural
gas
to
an
interstate
pipeline
company
is
subject
to
regulation
by
the
federal
power
commission,
and
that
was
the
phillips
petroleum
case
in
347
u.s.
and
of
course
it's
been
predicated
in
numerous
subsequent
decisions.
there's
not
the
slightest
doubt
to
put
the
points
specifically
that
the
respondent
producers
earlier
agreement
in
this
case
to
sell
the
gas
in
the
rayne
field
to
texas
eastern
over
a
20-year
period
and
its
implicit
dedication
of
the
gas
to
the
public,
to
the
performance
of
that
contract,
i
should
say,
was
a
sale
requiring
certification
by
the
commission
and
subject
to
its
disapproval.
our
argument
is
that
the
recasting
of
the
transaction
made
it
no
less
a
sale
in
interstate
commerce
of
natural
gas
and
we
proceed
in
three
steps.
first,
we
say
that
the
commission
had
ample
basis
for
concluding
that
revised
transaction
viewed
from
the
standpoint
of
the
policy
of
the
natural
gas
act
involved
what
was
both
in
fact
and
in
economic
function
a
sale
in
interstate
commerce
of
natural
gas
for
resale
to
the
public.
texas
eastern
thereby
acquired
gas
as
a
pipeline
for
interstate
transportation
and
resale.
it
thereby
fixed
the
cost
of
the
gas
that
it
was
going
to
resell
and
it
didn't
really
take
on
to
any
significant
degree
of
the
functions
of
a
producer.
second,
we
submit
that
whether
a
transaction
involves
a
jurisdictional
sale
as
they
say,
a
sale
in
interstate
commerce
depends
not
upon
concepts
and
definitions
that
may
be
important
in
the
law
of
sales
and
conveyancing,
but
upon
as
i
put
it
the
fact
and
economic
function
of
the
transaction
viewed
from
the
policy
of
the
act
that
we're
charged
with
applying,
viewed
here
from
the
standpoint
of
public
regulation
of
this
industry.
and
then
third,
we
distinguish
the
panhandle
case
which
was
so
much
relied
upon
by
the
court
below.
very
little
argument
it
seems
to
me
is
necessary
to
show
that
the
commission
had
ample
basis
for
concluding
that
from
a
regulatory
standpoint,
the
transaction
and
the
question
had
the
same
functions
and
would
have
the
same
kind
of
effect
upon
rates
as
an
ordinary
agreement
to
sell
such
as
was
involved
in
the
phillips
petroleum
case.
conversely,
it
seems
to
us
that
when
you
look
at
this
from
the
standpoint
of
its
substance
of
its
economic
function
or
the
fact
that
the
distinctions
between
this
and
an
ordinary
lease
for
exploration,
development,
and
production
become
very,
very
clear.
let
me
emphasize
just
a
few
points;
first,
what
texas
eastern
obtained
here
was
natural
gas
for
its
interstate
pipeline
system.
the
rayne
field
was
proven
largely
developed
and
so
the
estimates
of
the
amount
of
gas
there
varied,
it's
clear
that
that
was
gas
in
a
very
large
quantity.
texas
eastern
as
a
pipeline
wanted
that
gas.
it
wasn't
interested
in
exploration
or
development
or
production.
the
conclusive
proof
i
think
is
that
these
transactions
did
replace
a
conventional
agreement
to
sell
the
gas
lasting
over
a
period
of
roughly
20
years.
no
one
has
ever
suggested
so
far
as
i
am
aware
that
there
was
any
substantial
reason
for
recasting
the
transaction
except
the
effort
to
get
it
out
from
under
the
commission's
jurisdiction.
indeed,
in
withdrawing
the
application,
the
old
applications
for
proof,
the
respondent
continental
gave
as
the
reason
in
seeking
leave
to
withdraw
them
that
all
the
producers
had
entered
into
negotiation
with
texas
eastern
to
sell
their
gas
in
place.
they
described
it
as
a
sale
of
gas
and
they
said
that
by
assigning
the
leasehold
rights,
such
in
place
sale
of
natural
gas
had
been
made.
second,
i
would
emphasize
that
texas
eastern
took
on
very
few
of
the
typical
functions
of
a
producer
or
gatherer.
it
acquired
only
natural
gas.
all
the
oil
or
other
mineral
rights
were
withheld.
the
net
proceeds
from
all
the
liquefiable
hydrocarbons,
so
what
could
be
extracted
from
the
gas
were
reserved
as
a
production
payment
to
the
producers
say
for
a
little
bit
at
the
end
of
the
lease.
the
respondent
producers
even
reserved
the
rights
to
the
gas
deep
down
below
a
specified
level
where
further
exploration
might
be
conducted.
and
finally,
i
would
point
out
that
to
a
large
but
not
100%
extent,
texas
eastern
even
left
with
the
producers
the
responsibility
for
bringing
the
gas
to
the
surface.
that
responsibility
of
the
field
had
been
managed
by
continental.
a
texas
eastern
subsidiary
entered
into
a
management
contract
with
continental
on
giving
to
it
most
of
the
work
of
bringing
this
gas
to
the
surface,
also
it
reserved
certain
ultimate
rights
and
responsibilities
and
just
as
the
producers
had
paid
before
the
cost
of
continental
is
doing
this.
so
under
the
agreements,
the
cost
came
out
of
the
production
payment
assuming
that
there
was
any
production
payment
because
they
were
condensates
and
thus
was
subtracted
from
what
all
the
producers
would
get
under
the
production
payment.
and
so
in
all
probability
would
be
born
in
the
same
fashion
as
originally.
third,
i
would
emphasize
that
this
transaction
was
the
final
step
by
which
gas
would
pass
from
true
producers
into
the
pipeline
where
interstate
transportation
at
sale.
we're
not
dealing
here
with
a
transfer
of
leasehold
rights
among
producers,
those
who
are
interested
in
exploration,
development
or
simply
in
bringing
the
gas
up
under
circumstances
where
another
transfer
would
be
necessary
to
put
the
gas
into
the
interstate
pipeline.
this
was
the
transaction,
the
final
commercial
step
that
committed
the
gas
to
the
pipeline
system
for
interstate
commerce.
and
fourth,
i
would
emphasize
that
this
is
the
transaction
just
like
the
kind
of
agreement
involved
in
the
phillips
case
that
fixes
the
cost
of
the
gas
to
the
pipeline
and
it
will
therefore
be
a
critical
element
in
fixing
texas
eastern's
rates
that
it
may
charge
to
the
distribution
companies
and
so
ultimately
to
the
public.
there
are
exactly
the
same
reasons
here
for
regulating
this
transaction
that
there
were
for
holding
that
the
commission
had
jurisdiction
in
the
phillips
petroleum
case.
and
i
could
confess
that
i
can
think
of
no
reasons
that
would
lead
to
not
regulating
this
transaction.
it
might
not
also
have
been
applied
in
phillips
petroleum
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
what
undeveloped
lease?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
need
the
term
developed
and
undeveloped
don't
have
quite
definite
context
to
me
that
enables
me
simply
to
discuss
it
in
those
terms.
i
think
there
is
room
for
a
number
of
distinctions
here
chiefly
to
be
made
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
if
one
goes
way
over
to
a
transfer
of
a
potential
oil
field
among
people
who
are
engaged
in
the
business
of
producers
or
perhaps
simply
the
transfer
of
a
potential
oil
field
to
a
pipeline
company
where
exploration
and
development
must
be
carried
on,
that
it
seems
to
me
is
a
very
different
kind
of
transaction
and
would
be
treated
by
the
commission
quite
differently.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
we
probably
would.
i
look
at
it
mr.
justice
white,
let
me
put
the
two
steps
in
our
argument
in
the
reverse
order
that
i
stated
them
before.
i
would
say
first,
as
the
matter
of
our
general
principle
that
we
say
that
the
question
in
general,
the
test
in
general,
is
whether
the
essential
substance
of
the
transaction
viewed
from
the
standpoint
of
public
regulation
is
that
a
pipeline
acquires
the
right
to
a
quantity
of
gas
for
interstate
commerce
and
it
commits
itself
for
the
price.
if
that's
a
fair
description
of
what's
really
the
heart
of
the
transaction
and
i
intend
to
exclude
other
things,
it
would
overbalance
that
when
i
state
it
that
way.
that
i
say
is
the
appropriate
test
under
the
act
and
whether
that
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
i'm
really
coming
back
to
your
point
if
i
might
say
just
a
word
or
two
about
it.
i
think
that
the
proper
test
under
the
act
is
the
one
i've
stated.
that
of
course
is
a
question
of
law
that
this
court
must
decide,
what
is
the
proper
test?
then,
as
to
the
application
of
that
standard
in
any
particular
case,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
that's
a
question
that
is
essentially
delegated
to
the
commission
as
this
court's
decisions
in
gray
and
powell
and
the
hearst
case
and
others
like
them
teach.
now,
i
think
--
and
i
think
i'm
coming
directly
to
your
question
in
deciding
just
what
change
is
here
tip
the
case
from
one
side
of
the
line
to
the
other,
it
depends
on
examining
the
facts
from
the
standpoint
of
the
criteria
that
i've
stated.
in
this
case,
the
facts
are
very,
very
strong
for
holding
that
this
is
in
fact
an
economic
substance
of
sale.
one
should
suggest,
as
you
did.
well,
suppose
that
they
got
all
the
mineral
rights,
they
got
the
right
to
go
deeper,
would
that
change
anything?
i
don't
know
of
any
case
in
which
the
commission
has
faced
that.
i
think
this
is
very
similar,
if
i
may
suggest
you,
like
the
problem
of
deciding
who
is
an
independent
contractor
and
who
is
an
employee
for
the
purposes
of
many
labor
laws
in
social
legislation
that
you
can
make
all
kinds
of
small
differences
and
the
line
has
to
be
struck
somewhere,
but
the
difference
in
principal
and
the
cases
of
who
is
an
employee
of
social
and
labor
legislation,
depends
on
the
policy
the
economic
reality
from
the
stand
point
of
the
act.
and
so
here
we
say
that
the
test,
not
on
common
law
concept
of
master
and
servant,
and
we
suggest
the
same
thing
is
true
here.
now,
as
to
any,
in
other
words
if
you
get
way
over
on
the
current
store
of
an
undeveloped
lease
even
though
it
is
to
a
natural
gas
pipeline
company,
there's
no
need
for
us
to
argue
that
that
results
in
giving
the
commission
jurisdiction.
mr.
archibald
cox
no
i
think
it's
--
i
think
purpose
is
an
important
part
because
it
must
be
a
sale
in
interstate
commerce
for
resale.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
say
that
it
was
rather
the
essence
of
the
thing,
the
guts
of
the
thing,
if
i
may
put
it
colloquially,
is
whether
they
were
really
getting
gas
and
whether
they
were
really
fixing
the
price
at
which
they
got
gas.
and
if
that
is
a
fair
way
to
characterize
it,
then
it
is
within
the
commission's
jurisdiction.
now,
if
you
add
more
and
more
things
in
addition
to
the
getting
gas
and
make
the
amount
of
gas
more
and
more
speculative,
then
the
case
gets
farther
away.
it
may
get
so
far
away
that
the
commission's
decision
would
not
have
warrant
in
the
record
in
the
reasonable
basis
in
law.
for
example,
one
of
the
things,
mr.
justice
white,
that
distinguishes
the
instant
case
from
the
conventional
agreement
to
sell
gas
is
that
here
texas
eastern
does
take
of
some
economic
risk
that
would
not
be
taken
under
the
--
by
the
pipeline
under
the
familiar
agreement
to
sell.
it
will
lose
if
it
turns
out
to
be
less
gas
than
it
thinks
there
is.
it
will
gain
if
it
turns
out
to
be
more.
and
i
would
say
that
that
was
a
relevant
circumstance,
i
would
doubt,
we
certainly
think
it
isn't
decisive
in
this
case
because
in
this
case
steps
have
been
taken
both
to
insulate
texas
eastern
from
any
personal
liability
and
to
make
it
possible
to
throw
up
to
lease
without
future
payments.
if
it
turns
out
to
be
too
bad
a
deal,
i
would
doubt
to
taking
more
economic
risk
would
be
enough
to
tip
the
case
the
other
way.
but
i
think
each
of
these
things
has
to
be
taken
into
account
to
determine
what
is
the
reality
of
the
transaction.
i
come
back
perhaps
at
risk
of
repeating
myself,
i
would
say,
that
one
way
to
look
at
it
is
to
say
is
this
a
transaction
which
from
the
standpoint
of
the
purposes
and
policies
of
the
natural
gas
act
as
developed
in
the
phillips
petroleum
case
has
the
same
characteristics?
now
here,
from
that
standpoint
it
makes
not
the
slightest
difference
where
the
texas
eastern
gets
the
gas
under
a
conventional
agreement
as
originally
arranged
or
by
the
sale
of
the
leasehold
interest.
the
need
for
protection
of
the
consumers
is
just
to
say,
the
statutory
safeguards
are
equally
appropriate
in
the
one
case
than
the
other.
and
the
assertion
of
jurisdiction
creates
no
danger
of
interference
with
state
regulation
of
production
and
gathering
indeed
the
commission
specifically
said
was
not
interfering
with
that
part
of
the
aspect
nor
does
it
create
any
risk
of
federal
intervention
at
the
stages
of
the
industry,
truly
antecedent
in
any
substantial
sense
to
the
sale
of
the
gas
in
interstate
commerce.
there
just
aren't
enough
other
real
facts.
there
aren't
--
just
aren't
enough
differences
in
economic
function
to
say
to
draw
a
line
between
these
two.
now,
as
i
understand
the
respondent's
brief,
they
did
not
really
deny
what
i've
been
saying
about
the
economic
reality
of
this
transaction.
as
i
understand
their
argument
briefly
stated,
comes
to
this.
the
instruments
they
executed
they
say
were
not
a
sham
but
entailed
substantial
consequences.
their
legal
effect
was
to
give
texas
eastern
a
leasehold
interest
in
real
property
under
which
it
have
the
right
to
bring
the
gas
to
the
surface
and
to
obtain
title
by
severing
it
and
reducing
it
to
possession.
such
a
conveyance
of
an
interest
in
real
property,
they
say,
is
not
a
sale
of
natural
gas
because
it
isn't
the
transfer
of
title
to
a
commodity
and
it's
not
a
sale
in
interstate
commerce
because
you
don't
sell
real
estate
in
interstate
commerce,
and
this
is
an
interest
in
real
estate.
we
have
three
faults
to
find
with
that
argument.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
it's
production,
mr.
archibald
cox
i
was
going
to
treat
--
and
i'm
sure
i've
got
a
long
treatment
of
the
panhandle
case,
is
that
what
your
honor
was
suggesting?
yes.
let
me
just
finish
this
if
i
may.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
first
fault
we
find
with
this
argument
is
that
it
proves
too
much.
the
typical
long
term
agreement
such
as
was
involved
in
phillips,
to
sell
and
deliver
natural
gas
which
is
conceded
to
require
a
commission
approval,
does
not
then
and
there
pass
any
title
to
the
gas.
you
agree
to
sell
and
deliver
it.
you
fix
the
price
but
the
gas
remains
in
the
ground,
it
is
not
a
commodity
at
that
stage
anymore
than
it
said
to
be
a
commodity
at
this
stage.
and
of
course
title
passes
in
the
future
when
the
gas
is
delivered
and
so
here
are
the
title
to
the
gas
as
a
commodity,
well
i
suppose
pass
in
the
future,
it
passes
by
a
somewhat
different
process,
it
isn't
delivery
from
the
seller
to
the
buyer,
it's
rather
the
buyer,
as
we
would
call
him,
capturing
it
by
taking
it
out
of
the
ground.
second,
to
the
extent
that
i
don't
know
just
how
far
it
does,
but
to
the
extent
that
the
respondent's
argument
is
that
this
is
a
sale
of
natural
gas
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
applies
only
the
selling
above
the
ground
and
not
to
a
sale
in
place,
because
the
gas
when
it's
in
place
is
not
a
commodity,
i
suggest
it
produces
a
distinction
which
from
the
stand
point
of
purposes
of
the
act
is
demonstrably
absurd,
i
don't
mean
any
disrespect
but
consider.
if
that
is
really
the
line
of
distinction,
then
a
producer
could
agree
that
he
would
now
sell
and
pass
title
to
so
many
million
cubic
feet
of
gas
in
the
ground,
and
this
could
be
done
in
texas
where
you
can
make
such
sale,
at
a
price
for
a
thousand
cubic
feet
and
i
suppose
even
to
be
paid
upon
delivery,
and
there's
no
reason
that
title
can't
pass
in
a
sale
and
present
it
to
be
made
before
something
is
delivered
to
that's
part
of
a
normal
law
of
sale.
it
surely
when
the
court
decided
the
phillips
petroleum
case,
it
didn't
intend
to
open
that
easy
door
to
the
evasion
of
the
regulatory
process.
so
that
this
distinction
between
selling
the
gas
when
it's
in
place,
and
selling
the
gas
when
it's
above
the
ground,
i
submit,
comes
to
nothing.
but
our
real
difference
with
the
petitioners,
i
really
anticipated,
that
is
the
difference
in
terms
of
what
is
the
governing
criteria.
we
do
not
say
let
me
make
it
perfectly
clear
we
do
not
say
that
this
transaction
was
a
sham.
the
form
the
transaction
took
has
practical
and
legal
consequences,
some
of
its
legal
consequences
may
be
very
important
as
between
the
party.
it
has
some
practical
consequences
different
from
the
ordinary
agreement
itself.
what
we
say
is
that
those
concepts
are
all
right
in
their
place
that
the
criterion
from
the
standpoint
of
the
application
of
the
natural
gas
act
is
the
economic
function,
the
substance
of
it,
and
that
from
that
standpoint,
the
differences
between
this
and
ordinary
agreement
to
sell
are
small
and
unimportant
in
this
case
and
that
the
similarities
are
overwhelming.
now,
i
could
develop
that
some
length
the
general
principle
that
in
at
least
in
applying
a
regulatory
statute,
the
court
will
not
apply
the
technical
--
will
not
be
governed
by
the
technical
form
in
which
the
parties
cast
their
transaction,
even
so
that
form
has
importance
for
other
purposes
and
they
as
between
them,
but
it
will
look
at
the
economic
facts
from
the
standpoint
of
effectuating
the
policy
of
the
particular
act.
the
cases
on
that
point
go
back
as
far
as
early
cases
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
of
which
b&o
against
settle
is
one
the
best
examples
and
they
come
down
to
such
a
decision
as
the
lo-vaca
gathering
case
decided
by
this
court
quite
recently.
the
cases
it
seem
to
me
most
enlightening,
i
suppose
because
i'm
most
familiar
with
area,
are
the
cases
rejecting
the
common
law
test
for
the
purposes
of
social
and
labor
legislation
in
determining
who
is
an
employee.
there,
the
court
has
said
that
regardless
of
the
consequence
for
tort
purposes
that
the
particular
appropriate
thing
to
do
is
to
see
whether
the
particular
workers
are
subject
as
a
matter
of
economic
fact
to
the
evils
the
statute
was
designed
eradicate
and
whether
the
remedies
heretofore
are
appropriate
one.
and
that's
the
way
we
think
whether
this
is
a
sale
should
be
approved.
as
a
matter
of
economic
fact
is
this
really
a
transfer
of
the
interest
in
natural
gas
for
resale
to
the
public,
and
is
the
remedy
is
appropriate
here
as
it
was
in
the
phillips
case.
we
think
the
answer
for
the
both
cases
is
yes.
the
case
most
closely
impart
is
one
which
i
could
confess
i
overlooked
its
significance
when
we
prepared
our
original
brief
is
gray
and
powell.
gray
and
powell
involved
the
question
whether
there
was
a
sale
of
coal
for
the
purposes
of
the
bituminous
coal
co.
because
the
code
provided,
no
coal
shall
be
sold
or
delivered
or
offered
for
sale
at
a
price
below
the
minimum
established
by
the
commission.
and
what
happened
there
was
that
a
railroad
a
heavy
user
of
coal
leased
some
coal
lands
and
then
it
hired
somebody
to
bring
what
it
said
was
the
coal
in
which
should
have
a
lessee's
interest
to
the
surface
and
turn
it
over
to
him.
and
it
said
there
is
a
no
sale
here
because
there
is
no
transfer
of
title
from
the
man
who
is
digging
the
coal,
the
company
that's
digging
the
coal
of
course
to
us
seaboard.
and
the
court
said
without
pausing
to
quote
from
the
opinion
that
it
didn't
matter
whether
there
was
a
technical
sale
and
the
transfer
of
title
from
the
producer
or
not,
that
the
purposes
of
congress
would
be
hampered
by
an
interpretation
that
requires
the
transfer
of
title
in
the
technical
sense
to
bring
a
producers
coal
consumed
by
another
party
within
the
ambit
of
the
coal
company.
and
so
here,
it
seems
to
us,
that
while
this
isn't
exactly
on
all
force
because
there,
there
was
a
question
whether
there
was
a
sale
by
the
company
that
did
the
mining
to
the
railroad,
here
we
don't
even
have
to
show
that
as
long
as
we
show
that
there
was
some
sale,
but
we
think
in
principle,
both
in
the
way
the
problem
was
approached
and
even
in
principle
on
the
holding
that
gray
and
powell
is
governing
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
referred
to
and
stated
in
our
reply
brief,
yes.
and
it's
also
cited
in
the
principal
brief
but
in
the
principal
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we
have
the
panhandle
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
think
the
panhandle
case
to
which
i'm
now
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
--
i
don't
want
to
repudiate
the
dissent
but
i
think
there
is
no
inconsistency
between
our
position
here
and
what
was
held
in
panhandle.
the
--
we
will
be
happy
to
have
the
decision
prevailed.
let
me
--
i
was
just
coming
to
direct
myself
to
that
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
let
me
see
if
i
can
satisfy
your
honor
that
you
could
accept
the
panhandle
case
just
as
fully
as
anyone
who
is
in
the
majority
and
still
accept
our
position
in
this
case,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
panhandle
is
distinguishable.
and
if
what
we
are
saying
here
does
not
require
any
overruling
of
panhandle
or
modifying
of
what
i
would
say
was
the
holding
or
really
the
--
or
that
it's
probably
against
us,
because
i
think
it's
broader
that
it
needed
to
be.
now,
in
panhandle,
as
many
of
the
court
will
recall,
panhandle
operated
an
interstate
pipeline
system.
it
also
held
leases
on
lands
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field
where
apparently
it
functioned
as
a
producer
and
exploration
of
development.
also
this
was
a
field
where
there
was
pretty
well
known
to
be
gas.
the
gas
reserves
in
place
there
had
never
been
dedicated
to
interstate
commerce.
they
never
flowed
or
indeed
by
have
been
committed
even
by
contract
in
any
sense
to
interstate
commerce.
but
they
had
been
cited
by
panhandle
as
a
source
from
which
it
intended
to
get
gas,
or
could
get
gas
to
pipe
through
certain
facilities
that
it
had
asked
the
commission
to
certificate.
when
the
commission
sought
to
bar
panhandle
from
transferring
the
leases
on
the
hugoton
field
to
a
subsidiary
which
would
function
as
a
producer
and
perhaps
also
as
an
intrastate
pipeline,
the
court
held
that
the
commission
had
no
jurisdiction,
saying
that
the
transfer
of
undeveloped
gas
leases
is
an
activity
related
to
the
production
of
gathering
of
natural
gas
and
beyond
the
coverage
of
the
act.
now,
the
critical
and
i
think
undeniable
difference
between
the
panhandle
case
and
the
case
at
bar
is
that
there,
the
transfer
of
the
leases
was
not
a
step
by
which
an
interstate
pipeline
secured
gas
to
transport
interstate
and
resell
for
public
consumption.
whereas
here,
on
this
lease
transaction,
as
it
is
called,
is
the
step
by
which
interstate
pipeline
did
procure
its
gas
mr.
archibald
cox
the
lease
--
the
cost
of
the
lease
are
not
--
well
the
transfer
to
hugoton
--
mr.
archibald
cox
took
it
out.
some
of
those
costs,
there
was
a
question
about
whether
they
should
be
included
or
not,
but
the
sale
as
such
was,
i
suggest,
a
moving
away
from
interstate
commerce
rather
than
a
moving
interstate
commerce.
let
me
see
if
i
can
develop
that
thought
by
pointing
out
the
precise
differences.
hugoton
was
not
an
interstate
pipeline,
texas
eastern
obviously
is.
after
the
transfer,
hugoton
would
function
initially
as
a
producer.
it
would
develop
the
lease.
it
would
gather
gas
and
it
would
complete
the
development
and
complete
the
decisions
as
to
where
or
how
it
was
to
be
sold.
texas
eastern
won't
really
function
in
that
respect
at
all,
except
in
some
very
minor
detail.
in
panhandle,
the
gas
could
not
and
would
not
move
into
interstate
commerce,
into
an
interstate
pipeline,
without
some
further
transaction,
some
further
sale
in
the
sense
that
we
used.
whereas
here,
of
course,
this,
as
i've
said
before
is
the
transfer
in
interstate
commerce,
because
that's
true
it's
also
true
that
what
hugoton
paid
panhandle
would
not
necessarily
and
perhaps
not
at
all
have
the
same
significance
in
fixing
the
ultimate
rates
at
which
somebody
carried
this
gas
interstate
as
the
price
paid
here
will
have.
now,
i
suggest
that
those
factual
differences
between
moving
something
out
of
interstate
away
from
interstate
commerce
and
moving
it
interstate
into
interstate
commerce
are
paralleled
by
the
difference
in
the
legal
issues.
there
was
no
opportunity
for
the
commission
to
argue
there
that
what
was
involved
was
a
sale
of
natural
gas
in
interstate
commerce.
but
the
arguments
have
to
be
that
this
if
not
so
far
dedicated
to
the
field.
i
think
that
the
marshal's
lights
must
be
off
mr.
chief
justice.
i
got
up.
i
think
it
was
a
quarter
off
--
quarter
after,
and
we
have
an
hour
between
us,
mr.
coleman
and
i.
and
mr.
coleman
and
i
have
an
hour
between
us.
mr.

yes.
the
light
was
flashing.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
no,
i
guess
we
had
a
misunderstanding.
but
not
even,
i
understand
we
have
another
considerable
amount
of
time
more.
i
had
just
about
finished
when
i
was
diverted
by
the
lights.
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
at
this
case
in
its
focus
on
whether
there
was
a
sale
in
interstate
commerce
presents
an
issue
that
was
not
raised
and
could
not
have
been
raised
in
the
panhandle
case.
now,
i
think
that
--
excuse
me.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
there
are
two
–
i
think
that
there
are
many
differences
but
two
seem
to
me
particularly
important.
one
is
the
opinion
in
clay
brown
was
expressly
recognized,
that
where
these
is
some
strong
evidence
with
respect
to
a
contrary
policy
of
the
particular
statute
then
that
may
be
controlling
with
respect
to
the
meaning
in
words.
and
i
can't
believe
that
the
court
in
clay
brown
intended
to
modify
its
decisions
in
gray
and
powell,
hearst
case,
the
lo-vaca
gathering
case
and
a
whole
line
of
them.
second,
i
suggest
there
is
a
major
difference
between
legislation
of
this
kind
and
the
tax
laws.
even
accepting
as
of
course,
we
do
in
that
decision,
i
would
say
that
the
tax
laws
to
a
greater
extent
at
least,
take
the
transactions
as
they
find
them
for
other
purposes,
if
your
honors,
sees
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
that
there
isn't
any
overwriting
aim,
many
function.
they
are
intended
to
be
in
a
sense
neutral,
and
to
accept
the
business
purposes
of
people
as
they
carry
them
out.
i
don't
want
to
overstate
that
but
i
think
that
is
a
marked
difference
between
the
two
cases.
i
just
want
to
say
one
further
word
before
yielding
to
mr.
coleman.
i
think
it
is
obviously
true
that
if
you
take
the
language
in
the
panhandle
case,
that
undeveloped
leases
are
facilities
of
production,
and
apply
that
in
a
wooden
fashion
as
a
universal
principle,
then
it
is
inconsistent
with
our
opposition
here.
but
i
don't
think
the
court
ever
means
its
words
to
be
read
in
that
fashion.
there
are
leases
and
leases.
that
lease
had
as
i've
attempted
to
show
an
entirely
different
function
than
the
assignment
of
this
lease
has.
and
i
don't
think
the
language
was
intended
to
lay
down
a
universal
proposition.
and
therefore,
is
not
controlling
on
any
justice
in
this
case
whether
he
agreed
with
the
philosophy
of
that
case
or
not.
i
would
now
like
to
give
mr.
coleman
such
time
as
he
required.
