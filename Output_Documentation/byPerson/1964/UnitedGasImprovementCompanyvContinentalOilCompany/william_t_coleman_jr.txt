mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
in
number
644,
the
united
gas
improvement
company
is
a
pennsylvania
public
utility,
and
is
a
distributor
in
natural
gas
to
the
residential,
industrial,
and
commercial
customers
at
philadelphia
and
upstate
pennsylvania.
we
purchased
a
substantial
part
of
our
natural
gas
supplies
from
respondent,
texas
eastern.
thus,
it's
of
vital
concern
to
us
what
is
the
actually
course
the
rayne
field
gas
to
texas
eastern.
the
course
of
the
estimates
of
the
rayne
field
gas
varied
in
this
record
from
17.5
cents
to
24
cents.
and
this
should
be
compared
with
the
fact
that
in
catco
this
court
held
that
where
the
record
show
that
the
gas
would
move
in
interstate
commerce
at
22.04
cents
per
mcf
that
that
should
have
alerted
the
commission
and
caused
the
commission
to
hold
a
hearing
and
determine
whether
that
price
was
in
the
public
interest.
now,
it's
clear
here
that
“but
for”
the
decision
of
this
court
in
catco
that
the
parties
here
would
have
made
a
traditional
type
of
sale.
and
therefore,
the
point
here
is
whether
the
parties
by
merely
changing
the
form
of
the
transaction
are
able
to
move
gas
from
the
discoverer
and
the
owner
of
the
gas
to
the
pipeline
into
interstate
commerce,
and
put
that
cost
in
the
pipeline's
rate
base
and
still
escape
of
public
regulation.
in
fact,
the
issue
here
is
even
narrower,
and
that
is
whether
the
commission
had
within
its
power
and
its
judgment
the
right
to
determine
that
what
took
place
here
was
essentially
a
sale
for
resale
of
natural
gas
and
interstate
commerce,
and
therefore,
should
be
subject
to
regulation.
actually,
the
issue
here
is
easier
for
this
court
than
the
issue
in
the
phillips
case
because
as
you
recall
in
the
phillips
case,
the
commission
had
made
an
investigation
and
determine
that
in
each
judgment
that
it
did
not
have
to
regulate
the
producer
in
order
to
be
able
to
carry
out
its
statutory
obligation.
but
here,
the
commission
tried
awfully
hard
to
protect
the
public
interest
by
not
having
to
regulate
this
transaction
but
only
after
it
made
the
inquiry
and
made
the
determination
that
the
only
possible
way
that
it
can
protect
the
consumer
was
to
determine
that
because
this
gas
in
effect
was
going
to
move
at
interstate
commerce
that
therefore,
it
would
have
to
be
regulate
it.
now,
what
did
the
commission
had
before
which
would
justify
such
a
determination?
in
the
first
place,
it
knew
and
it
had
the
fact
continental
oil,
sun
oil,
and
the
other
producers
except
for
marr
were
known
to
be
gas
producers.
and
it
had
been
found
to
be
so
on
many
occasions,
and
in
fact,
decisions
of
this
court
have
recognized
that
sun
oil
and
these
other
companies
are
in
the
business
of
producing
gas.
secondly,
the
record
shows
that
continental
oil,
the
owner
of
this
gas
originally
was
the
one
that
discover
the
field.
third,
the
commission
had
the
fact
that
these
parties,
by
their
original
contact
demonstrated
what
they
wanted
to
do
at
the
business
matter
was
transfer
this
gas
from
the
discoverer
into
interstate
commerce.
and
the
only
reason
why
texas
eastern
ever
wanted
this
gas
was
to
sell
it
in
interstate
commerce.
in
the
fourth
place,
the
parties
knew
by
the
time
this
field
had
been
developed
and
this
contract
had
been
entered
into
exactly
what
texas
eastern
was
getting.
if
you
would
turn
to
the
record
in
volume
one
sir,
there
is
an
exhibit
on
page
163.
i
guess
before
the
luncheon
break,
your
honor,
i
asked
the
court
that
they
turn
to
page
163
of
the
record
and
you
see
this
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
163
of
the
record
which
is
in
volume
1.
and
you
will
see
this
chart
and
i
ask
your
attention
to
it
only
to
point
out
to
and
very
graphic
from
that
when
this
transaction
was
entered
in
to,
the
parties
knew
what
they
were
buying,
they
in
fact
knew
what
type
of
gas
would
be
there
in
the
ground,
and
in
fact,
they
could
assign
the
volumes
to
each
one
of
the
sense.
and
it's
also
important
to
note
that
even
after
the
transaction
was
completed,
that
the
party
who
had
been
the
original
owner
of
the
gas
and
the
discoverer
of
continental
oil
was
the
one
that
was
to
do
the
lifting
of
the
gas
from
the
ground.
indeed,
when
you
turn
to
page
828
of
the
record,
the
management
agreement,
in
the
whereas
clause,
you
will
see
a
notation
that
one
of
the
conditions
which
would
cause
the
pipeline
to
go
into
this
transaction
was
that
continental
assured
pipeline
that
continental
would
be
available
to
do
the
lifting
of
the
gas
from
the
ground.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well,
this
was
in
the
record.
it
was
introduced
at
the
time
of
the
first
hearing,
and
it
follows
right
after
another
exhibit
in
the
case.
i
frankly
don't
know
whether
this
was
to
the
contract
or
it
was
just
put
in
the
case.
but
you
will
note
the
date
as
of
january
1,
1959,
which
is
before
the
transaction
was
quoted.
i
think
it's
also
fascinating
to
note
that
at
the
hearing
they
say
estimated
gas
reserves
dedicated
to
texas
eastern
transmission
corporation.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
it's
clear.
it
was
prepared
by
one
of
the
parties.
it
was
not
prepared
by
the
federal
pal
commission
or
anyone
to
intervene
it.
this
came
from
the
producer
pipeline
side
of
the
situation.
as
i
indicated
sir,
the
parties
religiously
and
conscientiously
here
refrained
from
transferring
anything
other
than
the
natural
gas
already
discovered.
and
now
i'd
like
to
turn
back
to
mr.
justice
white
with
respect
to
the
panhandle
situation.
that
once
you
had
this
type
of
factual
situation,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
commission
would
certainly
justify
to
make
the
finding
that
they
made
on
page
972
of
the
record.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
this
is
volume
three
your
honor,
where
they
said
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
972
of
the
record.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
where
they
said
at
the
first
full
paragraph,
“we
have
jurisdiction
over
this
transaction,
because
by
it,
the
producers
transferred
natural
gas
to
texas
eastern
for
resale
by
texas
eastern
in
the
interstate
market.”
now,
no
such
finding
was
made
in
panhandle.
you
were
not
dealing
with
leases
where
they
have
been
fully
discovered.
you
were
not
dealing
with
leases
where
they
had
been
fully
proven.
that
there
you
had
undeveloped
leases
and
the
leases
were
being
transferred
not
to
a
party
who
has
going
to
resale
the
gas
in
interstate
commerce,
but
indeed,
they
were
being
transferred
out
of
the
interstate
commerce
market
into
the
intrastate
market.
and
the
problem
before
the
commission,
i'd
like
to
spend
a
minute
on
this
if
i
may.
the
problem
before
the
commission
and
panhandle
was
completely
different.
in
panhandle,
what
the
commission
was
faced
with
was
the
fact
that
when
the
pipeline
wants
to
resell
gas
to
a
distributor
company,
it
has
to
get
approval
to
say
that
we
want
to
resell
on
a
day-to-day
basis
so
many
mcf
per
day.
now,
to
get
that
approval
under
section
7,
they
have
to
prove
that
they
have
the
reserves.
now,
after
they
proved
they
have
the
reserve,
the
question
then
becomes
the
next
day
can
they
denude
themselves
of
those
reserves
and
not
to
be
subject
to
jurisdiction.
now,
that's
what
panhandle
dealt
with.
the
question
was
whether
because
of
the
words
in
section
7,
which
says
that
if
you're
going
to
sell
to
the
consumer
in
interstate,
you
have
to
get
approval
to
do
that,
and
if
you
come
before
the
commission
and
say
that
we
ought
to
be
permitted
to
do
this
at
the
pipeline
because
we
hold
this
reserve.
can
they
thereafter
sell
those
reserves
in
the
intrastate
market,
not
be
subject
to
regulation.
you
must
recall
that
that
transaction
or
the
panhandle
situation
was
before
phillips.
now,
i
would
think
that
once
phillips
was
on
the
books,
you
had
a
completely
different
problem.
and
the
court
probably
would
have
decided
panhandle
differently.
but
leaving
that
aside,
there's
nothing
in
panhandle
which
says
that
if
the
panhandle,
instead
of
selling
those
undeveloped,
unproven
reserves
to
the
intrastate
market
had
decided
to
sell
proven
reserves
where
you
can
actually
almost
by
name
and
number
identify
the
gas
to
a
pipeline
that
was
going
to
resell
in
the
interstate
market,
then
that
that
would
not
have
been
subject
to
jurisdiction.
indeed,
i
think
that's
what
you're
decision
in
331
u.s.
and
interstate
pipeline
says
that
whether
pipeline
decide
to
sell
some
of
its
gas
at
its
own
to
another
pipeline
that's
going
to
immediately
transfer
the
gas
in
interstate
commerce
that
that
is
subject
to
jurisdiction.
i
think,
therefore,
any
person
sitting
on
this
court
at
the
panhandle
case,
i
really
think
that
that
when
you
had
this
problem,
you
really
even
shouldn't
go
to
that
panhandle
case
because
it's
completely
a
different
problem.
and
so
what
you
really
have
to
determine
here
is
whether
the
production
and
gathering
exemption,
which
is
in
section
1
(b),
which
says
that
even
though
interstate
sale
for
resale
are
subject
to
jurisdiction,
that
this
does
not
mean
production
or
gathering.
now,
i
think
what
the
words
mean,
it
does
not
mean
mere
production,
a
mere
act
to
producing,
or
the
mere
act
of
gathering.
but
there's
nothing
in
the
exemption
which
says
that
if
you
have
something
that
is
a
sale
for
resale
in
interstate
commerce
of
natural
gas,
that
because
the
contract
or
because
the
passage
of
title
is
to
take
place
prior
to
the
time
that
production
or
gathering
is
completed,
then
that
means
that
what
is
otherwise
the
sale
for
interstate
commerce
for
resale
of
natural
gas,
somehow,
gets
taken
out
of
that.
i
think
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear.
and
one
thing
is
clear
in
this
case,
the
legislative
history
makes
it
clear,
that
as
far
as
the
congress
was
concerned,
they
didn't
think
they
needed
the
exemption.
that
if
you
had
a
sale
for
resale
in
interstate
commerce,
that
was
clearly
regulated,
and
that
was
all
they
intended
to
regulate.
and
that's
what
is
happening
here,
and
the
fact
that
the
transaction
is
dressed
up
so
that
part
of
it
may
take
place
before
you
get
all
the
gas
out
of
that
is
completely
relevant.
you
still
have
a
sale
for
resale.
now,
the
cases
have
made
it
clear
and
the
one
thing
has
been
constantly
litigated
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
decisions
are
uniform.
that
where
the
sale
takes
place
prior
to
the
completion
of
the
gathering,
which
is
also
in
the
exemption,
that
if
what
is
happening
is
a
sale
for
resale,
namely
from
the
producer
to
the
pipeline,
and
that's
in
the
interstate
market
that
clearly
that
is
subject
to
jurisdiction.
and
it
just
seems
to
us
equally
as
clear,
the
way
you
have
a
situation
where
the
transaction
here
and
the
commission
founded
a
fact
and
the
evidence
is
clear
on
this,
that
by
this
transaction,
that
what
the
parties
intended
and
the
only
thing
they
intended
was
to
move
this
gas
from
continental
central
oil
into
the
interstate
market
to
a
pipeline
that
sold
only
in
interstate
commerce
that
you
clearly
had
a
transaction
which
is
in
interstate
commerce
and
is
the
sale
of
gas
for
resale.
and
the
production
exemption
and
the
gathering
exemption
had
nothing
to
do
with
this.
and
this
court
really
faces
problem
in
phillips.
and
there,
it
determine
that
because
the
gas
was
to
be
resold
in
interstate
commerce
to
the
pipeline,
the
fact
that
the
producer
after
executing
the
contract,
nevertheless,
still
had
to
lift
the
gas
out
of
the
ground
was
completely
irrelevant,
because
the
thing
that
congress
wants
to
prevent
is
the
high
cost
of
gas
being
paid
by
the
pipeline,
and
then
that
being
charged
against
the
consumers.
and
if
you
have
a
situation
the
way
you
do
here,
where
if
texas
eastern
at
this
price,
is
able
to
take
the
gas
into
its
pipeline,
at
a
such
a
price
that
a
proper
finding
on
this
record
may
be
that
the
cost
is
24.5
cents
per
mcf,
that
under
those
circumstances
that
the
only
way
to
protect
the
consumer
is
that
that
transaction
is
regulated.
now,
you
can't
regulate
it
merely
by
the
pipeline
because
with
the
pipeline,
it
had
to
pay
the
money.
and
the
only
way
you
can
protect
the
consumer
is
to
regulate
the
producer
or
the
discoverer
of
the
gas,
and
to
say
that
the
price
that
you're
charging
is
not
in
the
public
interest.
and
so
therefore,
we
submit
that
based
upon
the
facts,
the
findings
here,
based
upon
the
purpose
of
the
act
that
it's
clear,
that
if
this
commission,
which
is
trying
to
do
a
good
job
is
going
to
be
able
to
protect
the
ultimate
consumer,
that
it
has
to
have
the
power
where
parties
say,
“how
can
we
frame
a
transaction
which
will
have
the
same
identical
economic
effect
and
if
you
had
a
conventional
sale,
that
somehow
that
doesn't
escape
regulation.”
and
this
is
completely
different
from
a
tax
situation
where
what
you're
trying
to
do
is
determine
who
has
the
economic
benefit
of
the
gain
because
that's
the
man
that
has
to
have
the
money
to
pay
the
tax.
here,
what
you're
trying
to
do
is
determine
for
purposes
of
regulation,
how
do
you
protect
the
public?
and
the
only
way
to
protect
the
public
here
is
to
look
at
this
transaction,
the
way
i
think,
with
all
due
respect,
any
school
boy
would
look
at
it.
that
clearly,
you
have
natural
gas
here,
clearly
the
parties
intend
it
to
lift
it
from
the
ground,
to
pass
it
in
interstate
commerce,
clearly
the
pipeline
is
going
to
pay
for
it
and
it
seems
to
me
that
just
by
reading
the
statute,
this
is
a
sale
for
resale
in
interstate
commerce
regardless
of
what
else
also
you
want
to
call
it.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well
sir
--
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
well
sir,
i
first
say
that
in
phillips,
you
could
have
done
exactly
the
same
thing.
so
you
start
up
with
the
fact
that
in
phillips,
if
you
want
it
you
could
have
told
the
pipeline
if
you
buy
their
gas
with
phillips
at
25
cents
even
though
that's
what
you
paid
for,
we
are
still
going
to
let
you
put
it
in
your
rate
base
only
at
20
cents.
secondly,
i
say,
that
the
test
where
the
utility
actually
pays
the
money
is
whether
it
made
an
investment
which
is
provident
or
not.
now,
that's
a
test
which
is
much
higher
than
the
test
as
to
weather
the
price
for
the
gas
is
the
public
interest
price
and
here
you
have
it
very
dramatically.
if
the
sale
is
regulated
by
the
producer
and
if
we
followed
catco
and
if
we
followed
what
happened
in
catco
and
remand
when
it
went
back
and
they
tried
what
was
the
public
interest
price,
they
determine
that
the
price
could
not
be
more
than
20
cents.
now,
if
instead
of
that
you're
going
to
regulate
it
by
whether
texas
eastern
in
an
arms-length
transaction
where
it
paid
$134
million
was
acting
as
a
good
businessman
or
not
which
would
have
to
be
a
test
and
you
have
one
on
the
record
here
that
made
the
prices
24
cents
where
the
commission
as
very
difficult
work
away
to
go
to
say
that
under
those
circumstances,
we
have
to
knock
out
the
other
4
cent
point
nine.
now,
the
other
thing
is
your
honor
and
i
think
is
you
have
to
realize
this
that
if
this
strike
had
been
right
on
the
texas
eastern
main
pipeline,
the
commission
would
never
have
been
called
upon
to
do
anything
with
respect
to
texas
eastern
which
would
even
call
into
play
its
power
to
regulate.
under
the
law,
under
section
7,
the
pipeline
doesn't
have
to
get
approval
to
buy
the
gas.
the
one
that
needs
approval
is
the
one
that
sells
the
gas
and
the
only
reason
why
the
pipeline
got
involved
in
this
was
because
to
take
the
gas
it
had
to
construct
22
miles
and
had
to
build
a
compressor.
now,
that
mere
fortuitous
circumstance
that
the
strike
was
not
only
on
the
line
should
not
be
the
basis
on
which
you
call
into
play
the
regulation.
secondly,
the
real
issue
here
should
not
be
what
the
pipeline
paid
for
the
gas
but
what
the
producers
paid
and
what
it
caused
them
to
bring
the
gas
from
the
ground.
so
unless
the
producers
are
made
part
of
this
record
and
they're
subject
to
regulation,
you're
going
to
have
texas
eastern
trying
to
litigate
this
matter
by
having
to
prove
what
somebody
else's
cost
were.
so
it
seems
to
me
that's
all
you
had
in
phillips
and
this
court
in
phillips
after
looking
at
this
said
that
the
only
way
to
protect
the
consumer
was
to
regulate
the
producer.
now,
phillips
came
after
panhandle
and
that's
the
practical
way
that
this
has
to
be
handled.
