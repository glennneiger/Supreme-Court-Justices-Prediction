justice
byron

white
what
about
the
undeveloped
lease,
mr.
solicitor
general.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean
i
assume
that
there
was
an
undeveloped
lease
is
there
the
same
reason
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
had
been
here
a
transfer
of
the
lease
at
all
levels
and
the
company
took
over
the
operation
of
the
lease,
would
there
really
be
any
difference
here?
it
would
still
be,
i
would
think
you
would
say,
there
was
a
sale
of
gas.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
suggesting
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
an
objective
test,
i
mean,
did
they
really
buy
gas
or
didn't
they,
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
part
of
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
coleman,
what
is
lacking
as
far
as
power
is
concerned
in
the
commission
if
they
just
regulated
that
pipeline,
and
attempt
to
get
at
this
price
through
regulation
of
the
pipeline?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
allowing
some
part
of
its
rate
base.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
the
main
standard
is
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
could
they
fix
the
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
what
stage
--
at
what
stage
of
the
proceeding?
let's
assume
that
they
didn't
have
to
get
a
certificate
to
build
this
facility.
when
did
the
matter
ever
come
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that
always
would
be
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
deserves,
if
you
say
that
the
commission
has
got
power
to
regulate
this
price,
to
which
texas
eastern
acquired
the
gas,
and
it
can
get
all
the
information
it
wants
and
it
had
gotten
all
the
information
already
in
this
hearing,
or
what
difference
does
it
really
make
to
you?
how
the
commission
does
this,
i
mean
if
it's
going
to
be
the
same
result
by
the
same
rules
anyway,
why
are
you
making
such
a
fuss
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just,
you
say
that
well
they're
going
to
get
--
they
could
do
the
same
thing
anyway
in
the
present
--
without
exercising
jurisdiction
over
the
producer.
i
mean,
but
--
you
represent
all
these
respondents,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
difference
does
it
make
to
continental
oil
company,
one
of
your
clients,
whether
they
--
the
commission
doesn't
do
one
way
or
another.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
i
get
you,
was
that
another
party
to
the
proceeding
and
i
thought
your
client
some
money,
but
would
it
all
end
up
in
the
same
result?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
--
if
you
say
the
commission
could
actually
set
a
purchase
price
to
texas
eastern,
how
can
it
possibly
do
that
without
investigating
these
very
matters?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
look
in
market
criteria.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
searls,
let
me
get
this
straight.
you
say
that
without
exercising
any
jurisdiction
over
the
--
over
continental
or
other
these
producers
that
the
commission
could,
if
it
wanted
to,
regulate
the
crisis
at
which
texas
eastern
acquires
gas,
that's
what
you
said
a
while
ago.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
do
you
think
it
could
in
a
transaction
like
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
remember,
--
remember
you
say
it's
a
sale
of
a
lease.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
say
that
--
if
you
say
that
in
the
transaction
like
this,
the
commission
could
regulate
the
price
at
which
texas
eastern
acquired
gas.
you're
saying
that
texas
eastern
--
that
texas
eastern's
acquisition
of
a
lease
is
subject
to
regulation,
if
that's
correct?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
the
source
of
their
jurisdictional
power
there?
is
it
their
power
to
regulate
a
sale
and
gas
in
interstate
commerce
for
resale?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
it
might
be
part
of
production
and
gathering?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
if
you
win
this
case,
the
price
of
gas,
the
texas
eastern
is
going
to
be
different
than
if
the
commission
wins
it?
or
are
we
going
to
come
out
with
the
same
result
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
a
different
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
we
really
struggling
here
over
the
price
of
gas,
or
just
over
--
just
some
litigative
advantage
to
one
side
or
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that's
what
the
mean
of
--
certainly
there's
anyone
would
almost
include
that
the
outset
that
this
is
really
as
an
argument
about
the
price
of
gas.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
only
--
although
the
commission
has
the
power
to
regulate
texas
eastern's
purchase
price,
you
say
one
way
or
another,
it
probably
wouldn't
have
the
tools
available
without
investigating
producer
cost
to
come
out
with
the
same
answer
that
it
would
if
it
had
this
power
of
the
producers.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
--
what
if
the
commission
was
following
an
area
price
approach?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
there
would
be
less
difference
between
the
two
approaches
and
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
