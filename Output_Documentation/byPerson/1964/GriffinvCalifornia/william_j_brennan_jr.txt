justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
i
just
say
it
for
myself.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
i'm
particularly
interested
in
and
i
hope
you
reserve
time
for
it
is
the
issue,
the
adamson
issue
of
whether
the
violation
of
the
privilege
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
comment
on
the
(inaudible)
to
take
the
stand.
and
i
hope
you'll
not
use
up
all
your
time
on
the
other
question
of
the
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
only
point
that
i
was
interested
in
mr.
lavine.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
i
suppose
you
--
that
the
court
might
have
anticipated
we
have
decided
this
case
before
that
we
trialed
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
doesn't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
stand
as
it,
as
an
actual
decision
of
the
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
had
it
before
you
submitted
those.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
harris
i
--
in
the
federal
system
of
course
it
is
barred
by
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
--
i
don't
know
how
many
of
the
states
(inaudible)
--
many
of
the
states
also
bar
it
from
the
statute,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
your
state
and
my
own,
new
jersey
has
been
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
otherwise
your
ideas
--
the
jury
would
think
if
he
didn't
take
the
stand,
he
must
be
guilty.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
except
in
the
federal
system
and
then
in
any
states
there
is
an
affirmative
duty
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge
to
instruct
the
jury
just
to
the
contrary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
