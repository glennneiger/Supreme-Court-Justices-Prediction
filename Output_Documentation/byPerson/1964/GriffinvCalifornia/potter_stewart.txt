justice

stewart
the
duty
to
draw
no
inference
whatsoever.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
know
if
that's
true
in
every
state
which
does
not
have
your
rule
and
maybe
some
states
where
there's
just
no
instruction
at
all.
but
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
many
--
in
the
federal
system
and
i'm
sure
in
many
states
there's
an
affirmative
duty
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge
to
extract
the
jury
that
they
may
draw
no
inference
of
any
kind
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudile)
so
that
would
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
would
meet
the
points
you're
making
now,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
insofar
as
we
can
assume
the
jury
follow
instructions.
justice
potter
stewart
oh.
justice
potter
stewart
your
--
i
think
you
and
mr.
justice
harlan
are
not
far
apart.
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
your
statement
--
you're
saying
that
as
you
read
it
the
court
in
twining
said
assuming,
even
assuming
even
going
on
the
hypothesis
which
we
do
not
decide
that
a
comment
rule
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
would
violate
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
last
have
to
embrace
it
in
the
fourteenth.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
question
maybe
that
has
a
compelling
reason
if
the
constitution
requires
it.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
gainey
case
the
court
was
careful
to
point
out
that
as
we
understood
the
instructions
there
were
nothing
like
this
comment
rule
of
california
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
whatever
it's
because
we
--
that's
the
way
we
read
the
instructions
now.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
mr.
harris
didn't
you
answer
a
little
(inaudible)
to
justice
black's
question?
it's
your
con
--
are
you
conceding
here
that
california's
only
interest
is
to
convict
these
people?
justice
potter
stewart
you've
argued
in
your
brief
--
you've
argued
in
your
brief
that
this
comment
rule
can
be
a
benefit
to
defendant
--
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
the
very
broad
inference
that
the
jury
would
draw
in
the
absence
of
this
instruction
that
they
can
only
infer
certain
things
and
certainly
the
other
criminal
rules
of
your
state
are
not
drawn
on
the
interest
of
convicting
defendants.
i'm
thinking
about
--
think
like
an
automatic
appeal
or
a
free
transcript
and
all
the
other
things.
is
that
the
only
interest
of
your
state
to
convict
people?
justice
potter
stewart
--
understand
it
was.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
think
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
concede
that.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
not
to
(inaudible)
is
it,
if
you
offered
it?
justice
potter
stewart
for
justice,
isn't
it?
