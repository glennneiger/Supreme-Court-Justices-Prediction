justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
harris
you
do
have
to
pick
up
with
this
case,
this
particular
case,
what
kind
of
views
were
as
the
--
the
defendant
is
not
taking
the
stand.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
only
--
do
you
say
that
both
the
prosecutor
and
the
court
have
found
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
again
if
you
say
that
--
not
any
kind
of
the
congress
would
have
to
testify
but
do
you
say
the
one
in
this
case
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
gist
of
it
--
the
comment
here
is
bad,
the
californ
--
the
whole
california
comment
rule
is
bad.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
do
you
think
there's
any
substantial
difference
as
far
as
the
jury
is
concern
between
an
instruction
that
says
that
draw
no
inference
whatsoever
and
an
instruction
that
says
that
you
may
draw
an
inference
but
here
is
what
it
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
--
do
you
think
it's
necessary
for
you
to
win
this
case
that
it
be
held
that
the
constitution
permits
an
inference
from
silence,
from
the
silence
of
the
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
way
you
put
it
a
while
ago
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
you
lose
the
case,
i
would
take
then
now
that
there
might
be
some
question
raised
about
states
which
--
they
don't
permit
a
comment,
they
just
permit
nothing
at
all
to
happen
or
to
states
that
don't
require
an
instruction
not
to
draw
an
inference.
