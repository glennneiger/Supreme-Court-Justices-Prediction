if
you
had
sentenced
him
in
a
trial,
a
separate
trial
from
the
from
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
same
jury?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
this
evidence
that
you're
complaining
about
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
doesn't
--
does
no
go
in
before
the
jury
that
tries
the
issue
of
guilt.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no.
justice
john
m.
harlan
before
the
--
in
the
first
trial
where
the
jury
passes
on
guilt,
essence
of
guilt,
is
this
extraneous
evidence
as
you
call
it
introducible
at
that
stage?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i
meant.
justice
john
m.

(inaudible)
justice

m.

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.

i
gathered
from
your
brief
that
in
addition
to
your
state
that
connecticut,
iowa,
new
jersey,
ohio,
new
mexico
and
perhaps
vermont,
(voice

justice
john
m.

what
you're
suggesting
is
that
the
rule
of
the
federal
system
does
not
have
a
comment
rule
that
no
comment
rule
is
not
--
is
not
of
constitution
or
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
you
say
overrule
because
twining
didn't
necessarily
said
it
that
way.
justice
john
m.
harlan
actually
that's
what
i'm
suggesting,
the
twining
case
dealt
no
further
--
no
--
nothing
more
than
the
comment
rule.
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
did
not
address
themselves
to
the
question
of
malloy
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
a
broad
language
in
it,
but
if
you
look
in
the
decision
closely,
you
will
find
that's
correct.
