mr.
morris
lavine
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
supreme
court
and
may
it
please
the
court.
now
this
is
a
death
penalty
case
of
an
indigent
negro
and
the
issues
involved
here
are
whether
the
use
by
the
state
of
california
in
its
prosecution
and
by
the
prosecutor
to
comment
on
the
failure
of
the
defendant
to
take
the
witness
stand
is
in
violation
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
second
point
that
i
intend
to
raise
is
the
question
of
whether
the
use
of
evidence
brought
in
from
mexico
after
a
judgment
of
dismissal
by
the
mexican
court
was
in
violation
of
due
process
of
law
and
in
violation
of
those
principles
of
law
in
which
a
defendant
cannot
be
twice
subjected
to
the
same
matters
which
have
been
previously
adjudicated.
the
third
point
that
i
intend
to
raise
is
the
unconstitutionality
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
of
section
190.1
of
the
constit
--
of
the
penal
code
of
the
state
of
california
which
permits
on
the
penalty
issue
of
a
criminal
trial,
a
prosecution
to
bring
in
all
kinds
of
matters,
the
horrors
of
the
particular
crime
charged
allowed
them
to
bring
in
evidence
from
mexico,
allows
them
to
go
back
into
the
history
of
the
defendant
and
the
great
many
things
which
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
crime
that
is
on
trial
in
which
i
respectfully
contend
is
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
morris
lavine
it
was
a
separate
proceeding
of
the
same
trial
your
honor.
mr.
morris
lavine
it's
the
same
jury,
or
a
separate
jury
depending
on
the
will
of
the
judge.
mr.
morris
lavine
was
with
before
the
same
jury
--
mr.
morris
lavine
no,
it
goes
on
--
oh
yes,
it
does
unless
the
judge
orders
a
separate
jury
or
a
different
jury
but
it
goes
before
--
mr.
morris
lavine
--
maybe
i
didn't
understand
your
question
justice
harlan.
mr.
morris
lavine
no,
that's
not
your
honor.
mr.
morris
lavine
now,
the
fourth
point
that
i
intend
to
raise
is
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
in
this
particular
case
in
contrary
to
the
statement
of
counsel
for
the
people
i
respectfully
contend
that
there
is
no
proof
in
this
case
of
a
substantial
nature
that
there
was
any
attempt,
there
was
any
rape
or
any
attempt
to
rape
the
woman
who
is
deceased.
this
involves
a
49-year
old
negro
woman.
i
may
state
your
honors
that
i
have
the
privilege
of
standing
before
this
court
18
years
ago
in
the
case
of
people
--
of
adamson
versus
california
formerly
people
versus
adamson
in
which
justice
black
who
now
sits
on
the
court
wrote
the
eminent
dissenting
opinion
in
which
four
justices
concurred.
i
may
state
that
your
honor
as
i'm
looking
at
the
landmark
--
the
case
that
has
been
referred
to
by
the
people
in
twining
versus
new
jersey
in
211
u.s.
which
was
a
direct
evidence
case
coming
out
of
new
jersey
in
which
they
relied
on
in
their
brief
that
there
is
--
that
in
that
case
the
issue
was
not
raised
under
the
fifth
amendment
but
was
raised
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
and
i
know
that
something
very
interesting
that
there
is
a
wonderful
dissenting
opinion
by
a
justice
named
harlan
j.
whom
i
assumed
is
your
illustrious
father,
it's
very
long
and
i
won't
take
the
time
to
read
it
but
i
will
read
one
paragraph
if
i
may
of
that
dissenting
opinion
which
should
apply
to
the
case
today.
what
let
me
inquire
must
then
have
been
regarded
as
principles
that
were
fundamental
in
the
liberty
of
the
citizen.
every
--
mr.
morris
lavine
oh
no.
i
wouldn't
say
that
your
honor
was
bound
but
i
would
say
that
you
would
look
up
to
your
illustrious
parent
who
had
a
wonderful
record
on
this
court
and
i
merely
cite
this
case
to
illustrate
that
even
as
far
back
as
that
case
the
principle
which
i
have
here
is
now
again
for
reconsideration
before
this
court.
and
i
--
mr.
morris
lavine
yes,
grandfather,
yes.
i
must
look
at
the
age,
it
was
1908
when
that
decision
was
written
and
i
would
say
it
was
an
--
most
excellent
and
persuasive
character
and
touches
on
the
very
issues
that
we
have
here
in
which
justice
black
so
admirably
presented
in
adamson
versus
california.
now
we
--
california
has
fought
this
decision
that
time
and
since
1934
under
article
1,
section
13
of
the
constitution
of
california
we,
who
have
had
the
occasion
to
practice
criminal
law
have
had
to
walk
the
floors
and
stay
at
nights
when
the
issue
came
up
as
to
whether
we
should
put
the
defendant
on
the
witness
stand
because
the
prosecutor
we
knew
would
take
his
right
and
privilege
that
a
defendant
might
have
--
does
have
under
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment
to
stand
on
his
silence
and
use
his
silence
as
the
tool
to
convict
him.
now
let
us
see
what
happened
in
this
case
and
may
i
very
briefly
state
the
facts
of
the
murder
in
this
case
or
the
killing
as
was
involved
in
this
case.
this
woman
who
was
a
common
law
mistress
or
wife
of
a
man,
all
colored,
met
the
defendant
and
they
went
to
a
bar
where
the
defendant
paid
25
cents
for
drink
and
then
presumably
gave
them
$10
for
other
purposes.
now,
they
--
he
was
invited
to
go
to
the
apartment
and
spend
the
night
after
closing
time
apparently
or
sometime
during
the
night
that
he
went
there
and
then
some
fighting
came
up
over
a
question
of
possibly
an
approach
to
her.
the
only
testimony
regarding
that
approach
of
any
immoral
purpose
as
the
statement
of
the
(inaudible)
common
law
husband.
we
don't
have
any
other
substantial
evidence
of
that.
now
the
next
morning
there
was
some
fighting
that
went
on
and
during
--
and
various
fights
occurred
during
the
night.
following
the
next
morning,
however,
this
woman
was
in
a
bin
or
a
sawdust
box
adjoining
or
about
300
yards
from
the
bottom
of
the
steps,
apparently,
the
live
--
room
that
they
were
in
was
an
upstairs
room
and
she
was
found
there,
she
was
seated
there
in
the
bin
and
some
workman
saw
her
there.
the
defendant
was
leaving,
somebody
saw
him
adjusting
his
clothes,
adjusting
his
pants.
he
didn't
know
what
he
thought
the
--
that
the
defendant
was
doing
as
he
said
number
2.
number
2
wasn't
defined
in
the
course
of
a
matter
and
anyhow
she
was
taken
to
the
receiving
hospital
where
apparently
she
had
a
subdural
hematoma.
now,
the
doctor
defined
the
subdural
hematoma
--
mr.
morris
lavine
yes?
mr.
morris
lavine
i
appreciate
that
your
honor.
mr.
morris
lavine
no,
there
are
four
questions
of
law
your
honor
here.
i'm
not
--
i'm
only
reviewing
these
facts
to
show
--
mr.
morris
lavine
there
was
no
evidence,
if
--
and
as
i
understand
the
rule
under
tho
--
under
the
thompson
case
that
there
is
--
if
there
is
no
evidence
--
mr.
morris
lavine
yes.
mr.
morris
lavine
i
--
well,
i'm
aiming
at
that
as
one
of
the
four
points
if
your
honor
pleases
because
i
contend
there
is
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
to
establish
a
rape
and
in
order
to
establish
a
murder
of
the
first
degree
there
have
to
be
proof
of
a
rape.
and
i
contend
that
you
can
examine
this
record
and
i
challenge
the
people
to
show
where
in
this
record
there's
any
proof
of
any
rape.
mr.
morris
lavine
yes
your
honor.
mr.
morris
lavine
i'm
coming
to
that.
mr.
morris
lavine
i'm
not
going
to,
i'm
coming
to
that
--
with
that
point
because
i
want
to
demonstrate
--
mr.
morris
lavine
thank
you
your
honor.
i'll
come
to
that
immediately
then.
here
is
what
the
prosecutor
did
then
on
this
insufficient
evidence
and
this
is
why
i
say
that
the
malloy
case
and
the
insufficient
evidences
that
has
a
bearing.
the
prosecutor
argued
page
605-a64
of
the
record.
it
is
my
contention
that
if
the
defendant
had
not
beaten,
dragged
or
pushed
and
i
don't
mean
dragged
all
the
way
down
the
alley.
i
don't
know
what
he
did.
he
won't
take
the
witness
stand
and
tell
you
in
this
courtroom
under
oath
what
he
did.
now,
there
are
two
things
in
that
statement
as
i
see
it.
first
of
all,
he
says
he
doesn't
know
what
the
defendant
did.
he
admits
that
the
evidence
is
insufficient.
he
wants
to
compel
the
defendant
to
take
the
witness
stand
and
be
--
have
his
testimony
extorted
from
him.
now,
then
he
goes
down
and
says
a
defendant
has
a
constitutional
right
not
to
become
a
witness
as
--
in
his
own
behalf.
when
the
defendant
does
not
become
a
witness
there
is
no
link,
if
there'd
be
a
missing
link
in
the
people's
case
that
is
supplied
by
the
defendant's
failure
to
take
the
stand
or
--
and
testify.
but
if
there
are
complete
links
but
some
of
them
are
weak
and
the
defendant
would
have
the
specific
knowledge
to
explain
or
deny,
then
the
failure
of
the
defendant
to
explain
or
deny
as
a
witness
creates
a
situation
in
which
the
inference
is
unfavorable
to
the
defendant
are
the
more
probable
and
the
weak
link
if
any.
not
the
missing
link,
the
weak
link
is
strengthened.
the
defendant
certainly
knows
whether
as
he
may
have
to
speed
up
appearance
at
the
time
he
left
her
apartment
and
went
down
the
alley
with
her.
in
other
words,
he
says,
“i
don't
know.
the
prosecution's
proof
isn't
sufficient.”
but
he
says
if
the
defendant
takes
the
witness
stand
--
if
the
defendant
takes
the
witness
stand
then
he
can
tell
us
what
happened.
so
he
now
is
trying
to
extort
testimony
by
--
and
argues
to
the
jury
that
his
failure
to
take
the
witness
stand
is
an
admission
that
these
things
that
the
prosecution
has
contended
for
were
true.
then
he
goes
on
and
says,
i'm
still
reading
from
page
605-a65
of
the
transcript,
“what
kind
of
a
man
is
it
that
would
want
to
have
sex
with
a
woman
that
beat
up,”
--
if
she
was
beat
up
at
the
time
that
he
left.
now
he
doesn't
know
that
she
was
beat
up,
he
hasn't
proved
it.
but
now
he
wants
to
extort
that
testimony
or
else
he
wants
the
jury
to
infer
that
those
things
occurred
by
the
fact
that
the
defendant
did
not
take
the
witness
stand.
mr.
morris
lavine
60
--
page
605-a65.
mr.
morris
lavine
that's
right.
i'm
reading
right
from
the
record
your
honor.
he
would
know
that.
now
here
is
what
the
--
here
is
what
the
prosecutor
argues,
he
would
know
that.
he
would
know
how
she
got
down
the
alley,
what
he
says
inferentially
is
the
people
haven't
proved
it.
that
is
why
justice
douglas
i
was
making
the
short
point
about
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
how
would
he
know
how
the
blood
got
on
the
bottom
of
the
concrete
steps?
he
would
know
how
long
he
was
with
her
in
that
box.
he
would
know
how
her
wig
got
off.
he
would
know
whether
he
beat
her
or
mistreated
her.
he
would
know
whether
he
walked
away
from
that
place
cool
as
a
cucumber
when
he
saw
mr.
villasenor
because
he
was
conscious
of
his
own
guilt
and
wanted
to
get
away
from
that
damaged
or
injured
woman.
these
things
he
has
not
seen
fit
to
take
the
stand
and
deny
or
explain
and
in
the
whole
world,
if
anybody
would
know
this
defendant
would
know.
essie
mae
is
dead.
she
can't
tell
her
side
of
the
story,
the
defendant
won't,
i'm
reading
from
page
605-a66,
it's
in
volume
4
of
the
transcript
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
morris
lavine
what's
that?
mr.
morris
lavine
very
ar
--
very
fully
argued
there.
mr.
morris
lavine
oh
yes,
oh
yes.
and
--
mr.
morris
lavine
that's
one
of
the
points
i
have
before
you.
i
have
a
second
point.
there
are
other
places
where
he
made
the
similar
arguments.
i
think
i
have
cited
them
--
mr.
morris
lavine
that
--
mr.
morris
lavine
yes,
now
if
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
morris
lavine
now
if
your
--
mr.
morris
lavine
now,
if
your
honors
please,
in
malloy
versus
hogan,
this
court
held
that
that
the
self-incrimination
features
of
the
fifth
amendment
are
applicable
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
so,
it
is
my
contention
here
that
this
case
is
governed
by
malloy
versus
hogan
and
that
this
court
must
reverse
on
this
point.
i
want
to
urge
one
other
point
for
your
honor's
strong
consideration
before
i'm
through.
but
if
your
honors
please,
malloy
versus
hogan.
is
--
it
takes
the
position
and
has
been
followed
by
this
court
although
the
people
of
the
state
of
california
petitioned
amicus
curiae
in
the
malloy
versus
hogan
case
and
objected
to
this
position.
the
earlier
case
of
adamson
versus
california
your
honor
in
which
your
honor
was
concurred
in
by
four
justices.
mr.
justice,
your
own
strong
dissent
in
that
case
certainly
spells
out
the
law
as
clearly
as
i
could
make
it
before
this
court.
and
i
also
want
to
call
your
attention
to
the
argument
to
the
dissent
of
justice
murphy
in
that
same
opinion
which
i
think
presents
my
point
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned.
mr.
justice
murphy
said,
"if
a
defendant
does
not
take
the
stand,
his
silence
is
used
as
a
basis
for
drawing
unfavorable
inferences
against
him
as
to
matters
that
he
might
reasonably
be
expected
to
explain."
thus
he
is
compelled
through
his
silence
to
testify
against
himself.
and
silence
can
be
as
effective
in
this
situation
as
oral
statements.
second,
if
he
does
take
the
stand
thereby
opening
himself
to
cross-examination
so
it's
to
overcome
the
effect
of
the
provision
and
question
is
necessarily
compelled
to
testify
himself.
in
that
case,
his
testimony
on
a
cross-examination
is
a
result
of
coercive
pressure
of
the
provision
rather
than
his
own
volition.
this
guarantee
of
freedom
from
self-incrimination
is
rounded
on
a
deep
respect
for
those
who
might
prefer
to
remain
silent
from
their
accusers.
now
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
a
--
in
an
opinion
that
came
out
about
the
same
time
as
the
--
this
one
did
murphy
versus
new
york
waterfront
stated
that
the
right
of
self
--
to
be
protected
against
self-incrimination
was
just
as
important
as
one
of
the
fundamental
safeguards
of
human
beings
and
i
have
the
citation
here
that
i
thought
was
important
enough
just
to
quote
even
the
first
paragraph,
“the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
registers
an
important
advance
in
the
development
of
our
liberty.
one
of
the
great
landmark
that
a
man
struggle
to
make
himself
civilized."
and
later
you
commented
on
the
fact
that
the
defendant
can
be
whipsawed
into
incriminating
himself.
and
i
want
to
say
as
a
practicing
lawyer,
past
president
of
our
own
criminal
courts
bar
that
we
stay
awake
at
nights
at
the
time
we
have
to
reach
that
crucial
decision
as
to
whether
to
put
a
defendant
on
the
stand
in
california
especially
since
1934
or
keep
him
off
because
we
know
the
hazards
and
the
use
if
we
keep
him
off,
we
know
that
the
prosecutor
is
going
to
make
an
argument
that
the
failure
of
the
defendant
to
take
the
witness
stand
is
virtually
an
admission
of
his
guilt
and
he
makes
this
very
dramatic
argument.
he,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury
are
asking
you
to
do
for
him
what
he
won't
do
himself.
he's
asking
you
to
come
in
with
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
but
he
won't
take
the
witness
stand
and
say
that
he
is
not
guilty.
and
it
certainly
whipsawing
the
defendant
and
to
--
and
using
his
right
against
self-incrimination
as
a
sword
instead
of
a
shield
that
the
constitution
gave
him
the
right
to
protect.
now
i
have
one
other
point
that
i
want
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
that
this
is
a
matter
of
bringing
up
this
evidence
from
mexico.
it
was
done
on
the
county
phase
of
the
case.
time
will
not
permit
me
to
go
into
that
because
i
want
to
reserve
time
for
rebuttal
if
necessary
but
i
do
want
to
call
your
honors
attention
to
the
case
that
of
louisville
--
of
united
states
versus
oppenheimer
in
242
u.s.
at
page
85
to
page
88.
the
safeguard
provided
by
the
constitution
against
the
gravest
abuses
have
intended
to
give
impression
that
when
it
did
not
apply
in
terms
there
was
no
other
principle
that
could.
that
was
in
using
testimony
from
another
country
when
there
was
a
judgment
of
dismissal
or
acquittal
in
that
country
although
there
was
the
courts
of
california
allowed
the
prosecutor
to
bring
up
witnesses
from
that
country
where
the
defense
had
no
opportunity
to
bring
them
up
and
it
was
highly
prejudicial.
in
this
oppenheimer
case,
the
court
says
the
fifth
amendment
was
not
contended
to
do
away
with
what
in
civil
law
is
the
fundamental
principle
of
justice
in
order
that
when
a
man
once
has
been
acquitted
on
the
merits
to
enable
the
government
to
prosecute
him
the
second
time.
i
submit
that
this
principle
is
involved
here.
i'd
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
further
arguments.
have
the
court
any
question
in
connection
with
the
facts
of
the
case
or
the
self-incrimination
features?
i
take
it
there
are
none,
i
will
reserve
time,
your
honor.
mr.
morris
lavine
may
it
please
the
court.
among
the
other
comments
made
by
the
prosecutor
in
the
whole
world
if
anybody
would
know,
this
defendant
would
know,
essie
mae
is
dead,
she
can't
tell
her
side
of
the
story,
the
defendant
won't.
and
a
little
later
on
in
this
argument
he
says
if
anybody
--
now
mr.
maple
made
some
comment,
mr.
maple
was
the
defendant
--
defense
attorney,
made
some
comment
about
dr.
noguchi
and
he
is
saying
some
of
these
injuries
or
damages
could
have
been
caused
by
dragging.
that
is
dr.
noguchi's
opinion.
i
assume
the
defendant
heard
it.
if
anybody
in
the
whole
world
would
know
that
this
woman
was
not
dragged
it
would
be
the
defendant
and
he
has
remained
silent
in
the
phase
of
this
so-called
accusation.
mr.
maple
made
a
remark
about
the
statement
that
(inaudible)
and
therefore
the
defendant
doesn't
have
to
take
the
stand
to
testify.
he
has
already
reminded
you,
told
you
his
story.
may
i
remind
you,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
at
the
time
of
that
interview
the
defendant
didn't
know
the
woman
was
there.
and
then
there's
further
discussion
about
his
not
taking
the
stand.
now,
coun
--
the
counsel
has
erroneously
stated
some
facts.
he
stated
that
the
woman
was
dead.
she
was
not
dead
when
this
man
came
along.
she
was
taken
to
the
receiving
hospital.
she
gave
the
officers
her
name.
there
was
no
further
conversation
at
least
recorded.
she
died
of
the
subdural
hematoma
which
was
the
result
of
a
doctor's
operation.
she
did
not
die
of
any
rape
or
any
attempted
rape
nor
of
a
subdural
hematoma
that
occurred
prior
to
that
time.
the
prosecutor
made
his
argument
and
pointed
out
that
the
subdural
hematoma
that
she
had
which
was
a
filling
of
the
blood
in
the
head
was
not
the
one
that
caused
her
death.
her
death
was
caused
by
the
operation
of
the
doctor.
i
merely
point
those
out
to
correct
some
of
the
facts
here.
now,
in
connection
with
the
opinion
in
the
modesto
case,
i
may
have
had
some
slight
responsibility.
i
was
before
the
supreme
court
of
california,
justice
brennan.
a
few
weeks
ago
before
the
modesto
case
came
down
i
told
some
of
the
members
of
the
court
i
was
coming
here
to
argue
this
case.
i
know
that
as
you
did
that
they
reversed
the
case.
then
they
spent
several
pages
discussing
malloy
versus
hogan.
now
there's
an
excellent
dissent
in
that
case
by
justice
peters
and
one
in
the
paragraph,
one
sentence
that
i
would
like
to
read
to
the
court
in
which
he
says
that
the
majority
--
says
that
the
majority
concludes
that
the
no
comment
rule
doesn't
do
anything.
that
is
to
assert
that
the
1934
amendment
accomplishes
nothing
at
all
whether
to
accomplish
a
great
deal
because
as
will
be
later
pointed
out
it
was
necessary
to
pass
it
in
order
to
change
the
then
existing
california
law
which
prohibited
any
comment
at
all.
and
justice
peters
goes
on
to
point
out
in
his
dissenting
opinion
by
--
an
argument
that
i
would
like
to
take
time
to
read
but
don't
have
the
time
to
do
it.
i
would
like
to
point
out
one
other
thing
that
this
opinion
points
out
also
that
the
rule
of
the
twining
case
was
reversed
by
and
has
ceased
to
be
the
law
in
new
jersey
in
state
versus
murphy
1964
at
204
a.2d
888.
i
did
not
cite
this
in
my
brief.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
the
adamson
case
is
not
the
case
here.
the
twining
case
was
a
case
that
passed
on
direct
evidence
of
some
--
in
a
bank
case,
it
was
a
misdemeanor
case.
the
question
that
came
up
was
not
under
the
fifth
amendment,
was
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizens
which
the
court
held
was
not
applicable.
later
on
they
discussed
due
process
but
did
not
discuss
it
directly
with
relation
to
the
fifth
amendment
and
i
again
call
your
attention
to
the
dissenting
opinion
and
to
the
very
able
opinions
of
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
murphy
in
the
adamson
case.
now
if
there
are
any
facts
in
this
case
that
the
court
would
like
to
know
i
would
like
to
answer
any
questions
here.
i
also
did
not
have
time
to
argue
but
i
think
that
this
is
very
important
for
your
honors
to
notice
the
great
prejudicial
effect
of
the
prosecution
in
this
case
in
bringing
witnesses
from
mexico
while
the
defense
have
no
opportunity
to
meet
them
and
to
a
relitigate
a
matter
of
that
was
once
litigated
in
the
mexican
courts
and
decided
adversely
to
the
people
but
nevertheless
they
brought
witnesses
--
those
witnesses
back
again
to
california
to
prejudice
this
defendant.
apparently,
the
prosecutor
felt
he
had
to
do
that
because
of
the
weakness
of
his
case.
thank
you.
mr.
morris
lavine
yes
your
honor.
mr.
morris
lavine
since
1934.
mr.
morris
lavine
no,
it
was
adopted
by
an
initiative
measure.
there
was
a
great
wave
of
reform
so
to
speak
on
criminal
cases
about
1933,
1932
there
about
and
this
was
proposed
and
passed
as
an
initiated
measure
in
1934,
the
first
time
--
mr.
morris
lavine
by
the
people
in
the
general
election.
the
--
mr.
morris
lavine
in
the
general
election
--
yes.
it
was
a
constitutional
amendment
amending
article
i,
section
13.
article
i,
section
13
was
the
statute,
the
constitutional
provision
against
self-incrimination.
they
extended
that
statute
to
say
that
the
prosecutors
could
comment
on
the
failure
of
the
defendant
to
take
the
stand
and
then
applicable.
a
legislation
was
passed
subsequent
to
that
in
section
1323
of
the
penal
code
of
california.
so
in
passing
on
this
you'll
have
to
depend
on
both
article
i,
section
13
of
the
constitution
of
california
and
section
1323
of
the
penal
code.
mr.
morris
lavine
yes
your
honor.
mr.
morris
lavine
that
is
correct.
the
public
defender
--
mr.
morris
lavine
that
is
right.
public
defender
requested
me
to
present
his
appeal
your
honor.
they
take
the
position
they
have
no
right
to
present
any
matters
outside
of
california.
mr.
morris
lavine
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
morris
lavine
thank
you
your
honor.
