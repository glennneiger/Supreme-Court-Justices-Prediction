what
you've
read
shows
pretty
surely
that
they
didn't
argue
that,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
shows
very
clearly
that
that
was
argued,
didn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
the
point
you
have
before
us.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
guess
that
he
made
it
that
firmly,
that
would
be
enough
to
show
what
they
utilized
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
that

your
time
is
so
short
that
i'm
hoping
you
would
argue
the
legal
part
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
seems
too
clear
and
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be
denied
that

took
advantage
with
fact
that
he
fails
to
take
the

the
idea
that
the
fifth
amendment
self-incriminating
clause,
it
protects
the
people
in
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
arguing
only
that
the
fifth
amendment
even
if
applied
in
the
federal
courts
so
are
in
the

courts
permits
the

i
wasn't

but
isn't
that
an
inevitable
consequence
of
proving
that
case?
justice

well,
if
it
holds
the
law
unconstitutional,
that'd
be
another
way
of
saying
it.
justice

l.
black
you
believe
it's
unconstitutional
and
holds
it
unconstitutional
may
have
that
effect.
justice

it's
not
inherent
