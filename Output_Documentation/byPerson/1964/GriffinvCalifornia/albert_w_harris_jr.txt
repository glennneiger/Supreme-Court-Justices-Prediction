mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
mr.
justice
black
and
members
of
the
court.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
i'll
limit
my
remarks
to
the
question
of
the
california
comment
rule
unless
i
have
a
little
time
leftover
i
don't
think
i
will.
we
are
not
here,
incidentally
let
me
make
this
clear.
we're
not
here
to
reargue
malloy
against
hogan.
we're
not
here
to
argue
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
not
applied
to
the
states
and
that
those
protections
are
not
protect
--
they
are
not
given
to
people
in
california
in
state
trials.
we
are
here
to
argue
that
under
the
fifth
amendment
the
california
comment
rule
is
a
valid
and
a
constitutional
rule.
this
very
issue
was
recently
decided
by
the
california
supreme
court
about
two
weeks
ago.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
your
honor
they
do
that
sometimes.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
and
various
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i
hope
so
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
this
that
the
court
having
decided
a
reversal
was
in
order,
a
retrial
was
in
order.and
therefore
the
question
of
comment
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
it
--
that
could've
anticipated
that.
there
were
of
course
a
number
of
cases
pending
before
the
state
supreme
court
involving
this
issue.
there
are
countless
cases
of
persons
who
have
been
tried
under
the
comment
rule
in
the
last
30
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
4
years.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
california
supreme
court
considers
it
just
that
your
honor.
they've
done
it
in
other
situations
and
we've
accepted
it
as
a
determination
of
that
question.
but
regardless
of
that
i
would
--
we
took
the
liberty
of
sending
to
the
court
copies
of
the
opinion
because
we
weren't
certain
that
would
be
published
in
the
event
sheets
by
the
time
this
case
was
heard.
and
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
your
honor,
well,
you
seem
to
have
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
is
the
issue.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
is
correct.
with
it
--
the
only
qualifications
to
that
being
that
the
(inaudible)
--
the
comment
permitted
in
california
is
of
a
limited
nature
and
we
rely
upon
that.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
in
support
of
its
constitutionality,
i'm
not
suggesting
we
would
support
or
that
any
conceivable
comment
rule
might
be
valid
but
then
that's
not
before
the
court.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
it's
a
fair
statement
that
most
of
the
states
do
bar
it
by
statute.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
in
that
--
those
two
states,
ohio
permits
comment
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct,
i
believe
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
we
feel
it's
based
on
the
federal
statutes.
we
--
in
that
connection
we
rely
on
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
main
--
the
case
being
the
wilson
decision
and
the
bruno
decision
that
came
along
a
little
later.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
certainly,
it
was
your
honor.
we
say
that
the
comment
provided
for
by
the
california
constitution
is
valid.
and
the
comment
in
this
case
was
pursuant
to
that
constitution.
there
was
no
claim
before
the
state
supreme
court
that
the
comment
here
exceeded
what
would
be
proper
comment
under
california
law.
so
i
think
there's
no
issue
about
that
in
this
case
and
you
can
go
beyond
the
balance.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement
your
honor.
i
think
there's
no
question
about
it.
and
i
think
when
counsel
suggests
that
a
prosecutor
in
california
can
say
that
a
defendant
is
guilty
because
he
didn't
take
the
stand.
he
is
in
error
but
california
law,
a
prosecutor
cannot
say
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
the
instruction
that
was
given
to
the
jury
in
this
very
case
sets
out
the
california
comment
rule
in
very
detail
and
very
accurately.
the
jury
is
told
that
the
failure
of
a
defendant
to
take
the
stand
--
well,
first
they
told
the
other
constitutional
right
not
to
testify
and
in
no
uncertain
terms.
then
they're
told
that
that
does
not
--
his
failure
to
testify
does
not
create
a
presumption
of
guilt.
they're
told
that
his
failure
to
testify
does
not
by
itself
warrant
an
inference
of
guilt.
they're
told
that
his
failure
to
testify
does
not
relieve
the
prosecution
of
the
burden
approving
every
essential
element
of
the
crime
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
they're
told
that
the
defendant
may
rely
on
the
insufficiency
of
the
people's
evidence
and
the
failure
of
that
proof
and
decline
to
take
the
stand
and
that
no
lack
of
testimony
by
him
may
supply
a
failure
of
proof
by
the
people.
now
that
being
so,
the
prosecutor
wouldn't
argue
and
he
didn't
argue
here
that
we
haven't
proved
the
point
but
since
eddie
griffin
didn't
take
the
stand
that
proves
such
and
such
as
the
case.
that
was
not
argued
here.
now
what
the
jury
can
do
and
what
we
say
the
fifth
amendment
permits
a
state
to
do,
what
the
jury
can
do
is
consider
his
failure
to
explain
or
deny
evidence
that
has
been
presented
in
open
court
against
him
on
essential
elements
of
the
offense.
they're
told
that
they
may
take
into
consideration
his
failure
to
deny
or
explain
such
evidence.
and
they
may
consider
that
as
tending
to
indicate
the
truth
of
such
evidence.
now
that's
the
evidence
that
people
presented
in
open
court,
not
some
other
evidence,
or
not
some
other
facts.
and
they're
told
that
among
the
inferences
that
may
be
available
from
that
evidence
and
from
all
evidencethere
are
various
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
those
unfavorable
to
the
defendant
or
are
more
probable
than
the
others.
but
then
their
cautioned,
its
--
that
it
is
unreasonable
to
draw
an
unfavorable
inference
if
the
defendant
does
not
have
the
knowledge
in
order
to
talking
up
here
about
the
evidence
shows,
that
he
would
need
to
deny
or
explain
the
event.
for
example,
if
the
evidence
doesn't
show
he
was
there
or
that
some
--
something
was
not
known
to
him.this
puts
a
little
burden
on
him.
we
say
that
this
instruction
and
the
comment
pursuant
to
it
and
the
record
here
bears
that
out.
only
gives
to
the
jury
the
opportunity
to
consider
the
failure
to
explain
or
deny
evidence
produced
in
open
court
to
establish
the
guilt
of
the
defendant.
it
does
not
permit
any
speculation.
it
does
not
permit
any
implication
of
guilt
from
failure
to
testify
because
that
all
of
the
inferences
must
be
based
on
evidence
produced
in
open
court.
and
we
say
this
is
a
much
better
rule
and
a
much
better
practice
in
criminal
procedure
than
to
leave
the
matter
wide
open
without
any
instruction
whatever.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
very
likely.
now
i
think
the
only
other
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
you
mean
to
draw
no
inference
whatever
from
the
failure
the
defendant
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
testified,
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
but
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
is
true
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
and
i
think
that
in
the
bruno
case,
this
court
held
that
the
federal
trial
court
had
to
give
that
instruction
if
requested.
now
you
might
as
a
defense
attorney
not
want
that
instruction
given.
you
might
want
nothing
said
about
it.
but
if
you
ask
for
it,
you're
entitled
to
it.
but
that
decision
in
bruno
was
not
based
on
the
fifth
amendment.
it
was
based
on
the
federal
statute
and
i
don't
know
of
any
authority
that
holds
that
the
fifth
amendment
requires
that
instruction
or
at
any
event
any
authority
from
this
court.
and
i
think
the
variation
in
the
states
that
mr.
justice
stewart
is
pointing
out
is
a
great
variation
and
i
don't
pretend
to
know
every
one
of
them.
but
i
think
this
very
variation,
the
numerous
rules
that
exist
throughout
the
united
states
indicate
that
this
is
a
matter
of
criminal
procedure
open
to
the
states,
that
is
to
either
have
a
comment
rule,
a
no
inference
rule,
a
keep
quiet
rule
or
whatever
they
think
is
best
suited.
and
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
that
california
show
that
our
comment
rule
is
the
best
conceivable
rule
that
a
human
mind
could
devise.
i
think
it's
enough
if
that
rule
is
permitted
by
the
united
states
constitution.
we
think
it
clear
that
it
is.
but
to
put
it
the
other
way
around
that
it's
not
prohibited
by
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
we
think
that
we
rely
in
this
connection
and
this
i
think
the
essential
issue
is
this
comment
rule
prohibited
by
the
fifth
amendment.
the
twining
case,
the
earliest
decision
and
the
landmark
decision
that
was
overruled
on
the
question
of
the
applicability
of
the
fifth
amendment
indicated
i
think
in
all
fairness
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
pardon
me
your
honor,
the
--
well,
i
meant
overruled
in
the
question
of
the
fifth
amendment
application
to
the
states,
not
on
the
question
of
the
comment
rule.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
my
understanding
in
the
twining
decision
was
your
honor
that
they
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that
certainly
may
be
your
honor
but
i
think
it's
also
clear
from
that
opinion,
from
the
majority
opinion
in
that
case
that
the
court
did
not
and
certainly
it
did
not
say
and
did
not
imply
that
the
comment
rule
would
violate
the
fifth
amendment
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
if
the
fifth
amendment
were
applicable
to
the
states.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
right.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
all
i'm
suggesting
in
that
connection
is
that
i
think
have
that
court
been
put
to
the
test
they
would've
upheld
the
comment
rule
judging
from
the
language
i
agree
that's
an
arguable
point.
but
in
adamson
the
majority
of
the
court
suggested
and
indeed
mr.
justice
black
recognized
that
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
an
implication
in
the
majority
opinion
that
the
comment
rule
would
be
valid
under
the
fifth
amendment.
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
adamson
held
that
the
comment
rule
is
valid
as
a
matter
of
due
process
of
law,
as
a
matter
of
fundamental
fairness,
as
a
matter
of
reasonableness.
the
federal
rule
based
on
statute
we
think
should
not
be
extended
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
and
we
suggest
the
court
to
give
some
thought
to
the
decision
incurred
against
california
where
you
drew
a
distinction
between
the
impact
of
the
fourth
amendment
upon
the
states
and
federal
statutes
or
rules
handed
down
by
this
court
in
it's
--
the
exercise
of
its
supervisory
authority.
we
think
the
same
distinction
can
properly
be
drawn
as
to
the
fifth
amendment
that
is
the
constitutional
provision
applicable
to
the
states
but
variations
and
procedure
provided
for
by
statute
or
by
rule
of
court
leaving
those
open
to
the
states
for
such
a
policy
as
they
deem
best
suited
to
their
interests.
i
can
see
no
compelling
reason
for
any
uniformity
from
one
end
of
this
country
to
the
other
on
a
question
such
as
the
comment
rule.
we
call
to
the
court's
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
thinking
of
reasons
extraneous
from
that
your
honor.
that
is
some
need
for
uniformity
in
criminal
procedure
but
certainly
is
not
right
now.
and
i
think
the
court
might
bear
in
mind
that
it
--
if
it
did
interject
a
rule
requiring
uniformity
you
might
be
throwing
into
jeopardy
many,
many
convictions
where
there
is
no
serious
question
of
any
guilt,
no
serious
question
of
any
denial
of
what
was
deemed
a
fundamental
constitutional
right
and
to
do
that
all
in
the
interest
of
some
kind
of
a
mathematical
or
logical
uniformity
throughout
the
country
we
submit
it
would
not
be
warranted
in
a
good
judicial
act.
now,
i
would
like
also
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
appreciate
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
this
court
your
honor
has
never
developed
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
i
understand
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's
something
that
the
--
may
very
well
be
inevitable
if
the
court
requires
a
uniform
rule
in
situations
of
this
kind.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes,
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
we
think
the
--
that
really
the
heart
of
it
your
honor
comes
down
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
as
a
matter
of
law
and
as
a
matte
of
fact,
our
rule
and
our
procedures
compel
the
defendant
to
take
the
witness
stand
whether
or
not
they
compel
him
to
testify.
the
argument
is
as
i
understand
it
that
because
the
prosecutor
may
comment
upon
his
failure
to
take
the
witness
stand
that
this
is
a
weapon,
a
sword
not
a
shield
as
to
the
defendant.
we
say
that's
not
so
that
there
is
a
dilemma
that
every
criminal
defendant
faces
in
a
criminal
trial.
there's
no
question
about
it.
there's
no
question
that
sleep
is
lost
over
whether
the
defendant
should
take
the
witness
stand.
as
anyone
knows
it's
of
--
probably
one
of
the
most
important
decisions
that
are
made
--
that
is
made
in
the
courts
of
a
criminal
trial.
but
that's
just
as
important
in
a
federal
court
as
it
is
in
the
state
court.
it's
just
as
important
in
new
york
as
it
is
in
california.
and
the
reason
is
that
the
dilemma
does
not
come
from
our
comment
rule.
the
dilemma
comes
from
the
fact
that
the
people
have
put
on
incriminating
evidence
in
open
court
that
have
either
--
is
either
proven
conduct
by
the
defendant
or
admissions
by
him
and
that
it
stands
in
the
record.
the
jury
has
been
told
from
the
outset
of
that
trial,
or
in
the
voir
dire
--
under
--
every
recess.
don't
make
up
your
mind
about
this
case
until
all
of
the
evidence
is
in.
here
comes
the
people's
evidence
as
in
the
griffin
case,
very
strong,
very
compelling
evidence
of
griffin's
guilt,
not
somebody
else
has
but
eddie
griffin.
now
he
attempted
to
rape
or
force
himself
on
the
victim.
now
he
left.
now,
he
broke
back
into
the
witness'
home
that
he
see
a
--
being
the
common
law
husband
of
the
victim.
how
eddie
attempted
again
to
put
griffin
out,
there
was
a
fight
that
he
was
hurt,
he
left
and
that
was
the
last
time
the
victim
was
ever
seen
alive.
the
next
morning,
eddie
griffin
is
seen
coming
out
of
the
bin
--
walking
out
the
alley.
according
to
an
eyewitness,
as
cool
as
a
cucumber.
a
few
minutes
later,
the
beaten,
broken
body
of
the
victim
is
found
in
that
very
bin
that
eddie
griffin
has
just
left.
ultimately
she
dies
i
think
the
next
day
of
the
injuries.
the
jury
has
heard
that
evidence
and
eddie
griffin
is
sitting
at
the
counsel
table
in
front
of
them,
under
their
very
eyes
when
that
case
goes
to
the
jury
without
him
taking
the
witness
stand.
i
defy
anyone
to
create
any
doctrine
that
will
force
or
even
permit
a
jury
to
strike
that
fact
from
its
consideration.
it's
apparent.
it's
obvious.
this
court
said
in
(inaudible),
“we
need
not
close
our
eyes
to
the
fact
that
every
person
accused
of
crime
is
under
some
pressure
to
testify
unless
the
jury
despite
cheerfully
framed
instructions
drawn
unfavorable
inference
from
his
silence.”
and
the
court
knows
the
inescapable
embarrassment
that
this
poses
to
a
defendant.
it
is
an
inescapable
embarrassment
but
it's
inherent
in
our
accusatory
process.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
it
isn't
your
honor.
but
the
compulsion
that
arises
from
the
incriminating
evidence
we
submit
is
inherit
in
the
process.
now
does
the
wit
--
then
as
the
officer
of
the
comment
rule
we
submit
that
if
the
jury
can
draw
any
fair
inference
from
that
silence
and
we
say
the
jury
can
do
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
then
we
say
the
prosecutor
should
be
allowed
to
comment
on
it.
and
in
fact
the
detailed
comment
rule
and
i
read
to
your
honors
the
instruction
which
sets
it
forth
in
detail,
gives
a
very
fair
and
a
reasonable
statement
of
the
impact
of
silence
upon
a
criminal
trial.
we
don't
think
it
can
be
contended
that
the
silence
of
the
defendant
as
a
constitutional
rule
can
never
be
material
or
significant.
this
court
has
held
in
a
whole
line
of
cases
going
back
to
at
least
yee
ham
against
the
united
states.
but
certain
presumptions
created
by
federal
statutes
upon
proof
of
one
fact
and
the
silence
of
the
defendant
give
rise
but
properly
to
an
inference
of
guilt
of
a
particular
offense.
as
recently
as
a
week
ago,
a
week
ago
yesterday
this
court
handed
down
an
opinion
u.s.
against
gainey
upholding
a
presumptive
law
of
this
kind.
now
i'm
unaware
that
mr.
justice
black
has
spoken
up
a
presumptive
squeeze
upon
the
defendant
but
we
submit
that
this
court
has
held
repeatedly
for
40
years
that
there
is
no
such
presumptive
squeeze
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
appreciate
that
your
honor
but
i
think
that
was
probably
because
this
was
a
federal
prosecution
and
of
course
the
federal
statute
and
the
federal
rule
against
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
comment
would've
been
violated
not
because
the
fifth
amendment
might
have
been
violated
by
the
comment.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
well,
if
you'd
read
them
so,
there
was
comment,
you
might
have
had
to
reverse
under
the
federal
statutory
rule.
in
yee
ham
it's
--
the
court
makes
it
clear
that
the
constraint
that
arises
during
a
criminal
trial
upon
a
defendant
and
there
the
court
was
talking
about
a
presumption.
here
we're
talking
about
a
comment
rule
arises
from
the
force
of
circumstances
and
not
from
the
presumption
itself
and
that
we
submit
not
from
the
comment
rule
itself.
if
anything
the
california
comment
rule
is
far
less
subject
to
criticism,
far
less
subject
to
criticism
than
federal
presumptive.
statutes,
because
under
the
federal
statutes
there's
a
presumption
of
guilt
and
there
was
a
--
the
statutory
provision
that
such
and
such
will
be
sufficient
evidence
if
the
defendant
doesn't
explain.
that
is
not
california
law.
there
can
be
no
presumption
of
guilt
in
the
california
law,
there
cannot
even
be
an
inference
of
guilt
under
california
law,
from
the
failure
to
testify
alone.
in
addition,
we'd
like
to
point
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
the
failure
to
explain
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
correct
your
honor
but
only
as
to
matters
that
have
been
proven
by
the
people
and
the
effect
of
the
failure
of
the
defendant
to
explain
or
deny
those
matters
that
have
been
proven.
not
speculation,
not
--
no
argument
that
he
is
guilty
because
he
didn't
take
the
stand.
the
argument
has
to
be
a
careful
argument.
it
has
to
be
--
mr.
justice
(inaudible)
points
out
in
the
california
--
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
california
you
have
to
repeat
just
about
this
constitutional
language
whenever
you
talk
about
the
defendant
and
you
have
to
do
what
the
prosecutor
here
did.
and
we
submit
what
he
did
was
proper
and
was
not
an
infringement
of
griffin's
constitutional
rights.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
in
effect
upon
the
jury
your
honor?
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i'm
sorry
that's
hard
to
tell.
there
is
--
i
think
a
respectable
body
of
belief
that
the
instruction
that
you
--
you're
to
draw
no
inference
is
confusing
and
really
meaningless
of
the
jury
because
of
the
facts
i
have
just
outlined
that
is
they
know
this
man
was
there.
they
know
he
could
take
the
witness
stand
and
they
know
he
is
still
sitting
at
the
counsel
table.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
wahatever
you
said
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
i
think
we
could
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
think
we
could
probably
reason
around
that
but
i
think
that's
the
heart
of
the
case.t
hat
is
whether
the
jury
can
properly
infer
any
facts
from
his
silence.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well,
there
might
be
some
question,
yes,
your
honor
about
those.
and
i
think
there'd
be
a
great
deal
of
question
about
all
of
the
federal
presumptions
and
all
of
the
state
presumptions
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
and
every
rule.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
--
well
i
think
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
that
was
the
question
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
there
no
question
your
honor
that's
why
this
is
put
in.
it
was
put
in
to
convict
guilty
people
to
determine
the
truth
in
the
course
of
a
criminal
trial
but
not
to
invade
any
constitutional
rights
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
where
that
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
i
can't
agree
with
that
your
honor.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
you
can
only
convict
him
on
competent
evidence
produced
by
the
people
in
open
court.
you
can
only
rely
on
the
--
on
silence
on
the
failure
to
testify
to
draw
inferences
from
the
evidence
produced
in
open
court.
you
cannot
presume
or
infer
guilt
as
such
from
the
failure
to
testify.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
we
feel
that's
going
to
be
the
result
your
honor
under
any
rule
you'll
hand
down.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
no,
we
--
i
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
that
is
not
the
only
interest
of
our
state
your
honor
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
but
it
is
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
perhaps
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
what
i
had
in
mind
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
what
i
had
in
mind
was
this,
that
i
think
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
well
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
to
do
justice,
that's
correct
your
honor,
to
convict
the
innocent
and
acquit
--
convict
the
guilty
and
acquit
the
innocent.
but
i
do,
i
do
think
that
what
you
raised
your
honor
is
an
important
point.
and
i
don't
want
to
stand
before
the
court
and
suggest
that
this
rule
was
put
in
the
constitution
to
help
criminal
defendants
or
to
help
defense
attorneys.
i
don't
think
any
prosecutor
could
honestly
say
that
this
rule
is
helpful
to
defendants,
it
maybe
but
it's
not
on
the
constitution
for
that
reason.
but
we
think
it
does
help
determine
the
truth
and
that's
what
we're
interested
in
california.
we've
also
noted,
if
it
please
the
court
that
the
language
of
penalty
is
very
significant
in
malloy
against
hogan.
mr.
justice
brennan
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
cohen
against
hurley
at
page
159
noted
that
neither
twining
or
adamson
which
involves
comment
rules
--
that
neither
of
those
cases
involved
the
question
here
presented
of
the
constitutionality
of
a
penalty
visited
by
a
state
upon
a
citizen
for
invoking
the
privilege.
both
involved
only
the
much
narrower
question
whether
comment
was
constitutionally
permissible.
we
say
california
imposes
no
penalty
upon
a
defendant.
we
say
california
does
not
compel
a
defendant
to
testify.
we
say
that
the
california
comment
rule
is
constitutional
and
consistent
with
the
fifth
amendment.
thank
you.
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
i
thank
your
honor.
this
is
my
18th
appearance
before
your
honors.
i
haven't
been
before
all
of
the
members
of
the
court
before
but
i
have
been
(inaudible),
the
adamson,
(inaudible)
and
several
others.
thank
you
your
honor
--
mr.
albert
w.
harris,
jr.
--
for
that
very
kind
comment.
