were
the
obligations
the
same
in
aikins?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
interest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
--
do
you
view
the
new
law
as
not
changing
the
obligation
of
that
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
if
you
haven't
passed
--
if
you
hadn't
passed
that
law,
was
the
state
not
an
obligation
to
let
him
have
the
land?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
didn't
they
like
to
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
why
wasn't
it
the
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
was
it
necessary
to
change
the
law
if
the
contract
wouldn't
change
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
resolve
the
procedure
but
what
did
it
resolve
in
so
far
as
he
was
concerned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
terminated
the
contractual
rights
which
he
would
have
had
but
part
of
the
passing
to
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
might
not
accept
the
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
the
policy.
i'm
talking
about
the
state
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
is
it
if
not
a
contractual
provision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
obligation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
what
if
--
what
if
round
up
with,
whatever
you
call
it,
what
if
he
had
a
contract
which
was
absolutely
good.
and
he
could
have
waited
until
the
time
he
did
wait
to
pay
the
interest.
the
state
comes
along
with
the
law
which
takes
away
the
right
from
him
to
pay
the
interest
which
he
could
have
paid
under
the
contract
and
done
with
his
property,
didn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
he
was
in
default,
didn't
it
provide
what
you
have
if
he's
in
default?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
it
provide?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
state
didn't
have
any
right
after
that
time
to
bar
him
from
telling
him
to
pay
after
the
time
of
the
statute,
did
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
how
you
say
it.
the
state
didn't
contract,
that
they
didn't
abided
on
the
term
that
is
actually
made
in
the
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
read
the
second
facet
of
that
aikins
case
about
the
obligation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
rely
on
that
as
changing
the
state's
obligation
under
the
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
you
allow
it
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
claims
that
the
state
refuse
to
buy
it
by
its
burden
by
using
its
power
and
the
state
legislature
of
where
it
was
--
i
mean
the
city
is
using
its
power
to
pass
the
law,
which
relieves
it
from
this
obligation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
contract
would
do
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
done
it
in
big
bold
type.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
a
one-sided
obligation
or
was
it
an
obligation
on
both
parties?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
accordance
to
the
terms
that
he
had
agreed
to
pay?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
did
pay
it
under
this
term
he
had
agreed
to
pay
it
so
far
as
the
contract
was
concerned,
leaving
out
the
error
of
the
--
the
new
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
not?
if
not,
that's
the
--
that's
an
issue.
of
course
if
he
didn't
--
didn't
he
pay
it
within
the
--
within
the
obligation
he
had
assumed
within
the
time
to
pick
those
obligations
if
the
new
act
had
not
been
touched?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
everything
the
state
agreed
to
do
in
connection
with
this
contract
and
the
obligation
was
imposed
on
him,
fixed
by
the
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
can't
distinguish,
can
you,
between
the
obligation
that
he
didn't
pay
up
within
a
certain
time
and
get
it
profited
in
any
other
obligation
that
the
state
assumes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
distinguish
between
that
part
of
the
contract
that
gives
him
a
certain
length
of
time
to
make
all
the
full
payments
and
any
other
obligations
that
the
state
assumes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
part
of
the
agreement,
what
the
state
agreed
to
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
let's
forget
the
word
obligation.
what
they
agreed
to
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
certain
terms
and
conditions
set
out
in
the
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
makes
him
a
part
of
the
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
the
decisions
under
the
impairment
of
contract
clause?
