mr.
william
j.
mounce
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
title
to
approximately
620
acres
of
land
located
in
el
paso
county,
texas.
at
the
trial
court,
both
sides
moved
for
summary
judgment.
the
city
of
el
paso's
motion
was
granted
and
the
“at
motion”
of
the
appellee
simmons
was
denied.
on
appeal,
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
case.
the
facts
in
this
particular
case
may
be
very
briefly
stated.
the
appellee
simmons,
predecessors
in
title,
purchased
these
lands
involved
from
the
state
of
texas
in
1910.
the
predecessors
in
title
failed
to
pay
interest
on
the
original
purchase
and
the
lands
were
forfeited
to
the
state
of
texas
in
1947
and
reverted
to
the
public
domain.
simmons
acquired
title
in
june
of
1952,
and
in
the
latter
part
of
july,
attempted
to
reinstate
the
original
purchases.
his
tendered
reinstatement
was
refused
because
of
the
fact
that
they
had
not
been
received
by
the
land
commissioner
within
the
five
years
prescribed
by
the
statute
within
effect.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
by
quitclaim
deed.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
from
mean
grantees
of
the
original
purchasers.
in
the
latter
part
of
1955,
these
lands
were
awarded
to
the
city
of
el
paso.
and
in
1956,
they
were
actually
patented
to
the
city
of
el
paso.
and
this
suit
was
filed
in
the
latter
part
of
august
in
1961.
at
the
time
that
these
lands
were
purchased
from
the
state
of
texas,
there
was
a
statute
in
effect
which
i
believe
is
4218
which
regulated
the
one
man
that
the
state
of
texas
might
terminate
land
purchase
contracts.
and
that
statute
provides
that
a
land
purchase
agreement
might
be
reinstated
by
paying
up
all
back
interest
providing
that
no
rights
of
the
third
parties
had
intervened.
this
particular
statute
was
amended
in
1941
to
provide
that
in
case
that
lands
were
forfeited
for
the
nonpayment
of
interest
that
the
lands
may
be
reinstated
by
making
payment
of
all
back
interest
due,
and
provided
that
that
by
it's
no
third
party
have
intervened
and
added
one
proviso
that
this
must
be
accomplished
within
five
years.
so
the
question
therefore
presented
for
this
court
at
this
time
is
whether
the
application
of
the
statute
of
1941
which
is
article
5336
impairs
the
obligation
of
these
original
contracts.
it
is
the
position
of
the
city
of
el
paso
that
the
proviso
requiring
that
the
reinstatement
that
the
land
purchase
agreements
be
reinstated
within
the
five-year
period
is
merely
a
remedy.
in
other
words,
it's
one
of
the
methods
by
which
the
state
of
texas
enforces
its
contracts
and
it's
not
necessarily
an
obligation
of
the
contract.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
order
to
determine
whether
a
contract
obligation
has
been
impaired,
one
must
first
determine
what
the
obligations
are
in
the
contract.
and
in
this
respect,
we're
guided
by
some
cases
decided
for
this
court
in
1900,
which
considering
con
--
land
purchase
contracts
from
the
state
of
texas
substantially
the
same
as
the
contracts
not
in
consideration
held
that
the
obligations
of
the
contract
were
one,
that
the
purchaser
would
pay
down
a
certain
sum
of
money
and
make
these
payments
each
year
until
he'd
paid
it
off
and
whenever
he
had
paid
his
money,
although
required
by
the
contract,
then
the
state
of
texas
would
issue
patent
that
this
purely
and
simply
with
obligations
of
the
contract.
that
the
method
by
which
the
state
of
texas
enforced
the
particular
obligations
and
terminated
the
contract
rights
referred
merely
to
the
remedy
and
consequently
could
be
modified
from
time
to
time
as
long
as
the
changes
were
reasonable.
and
we
submit
that
this
is
precisely
what
we
have
here.
the
state
has
merely
modified
the
manner
in
which
it
terminates
the
land
purchase
contracts.
and
it's
not
necessarily
impaired
obligation
for
the
contract.
we
feel
that
this
case
is
probably
squarely
or
almost
squarely
in
point
with
that
of
aikins
versus
kingsbury
which
is
decided
by
this
court
in
the
1920s.
that
involved
a
california
land
purchase
agreement.
at
the
time
the
lands
were
originally
purchased
the
only
method
by
which
the
state
of
california
can
terminate
the
purchase
contract,
would
be
to
actually
file
a
quiet
title
action,
obtain
a
judgment.
then
the
purchaser
had
20
days
after
the
judgment
was
entered
within
which
to
come
in
and
redeem
his
purchase
or
by
paying
all
back
sums
due
plus
all
court
costs.
now,
this
particular
act
was
amended
some
20
years
after
the
original
purchaser
bought
his
land
to
provide
that
if
the
contracts
were
in
default
that
the
purchaser
would
have
six
months
from
the
date
of
the
act
within
which
to
reinstate
his
purchase,
otherwise,
he
completely
loss
everything.
and
that
particular
original
purchaser
or
his
successor
contended
that
this
was
an
impairment
of
obligations
of
his
contract
and
this
court
held
that
it
was
not
an
obligation.
that
is
merely
a
change
of
remedy
or
merely
a
change
in
the
method
by
which
the
state
terminated
its
contract
which
it
could
do
from
time
to
time
so
long
as
the
modification
was
reasonable.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
and,
what
do
you
mean
sir?
mr.
william
j.
mounce
yes
it
remanded
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
well,
it's
quite
similar,
as
a
practical
matter
i
think
would
probably
do
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
as
a
legal
matter,
i
--
it's
very
questionable.
i
cited
the
railroad
case
in
there.
that
was
a
problem
where
of
course
we
were
confronted
where
we
made
the
appeal.
it's
difficult
to
determine
whether
it
was
final
or
not,
really
isn't.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
for
determination
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
yes.
but
the
fact,
and
i'll
be
real
candid
at
this
point,
the
facts
regarding
adverse
position
are
quite
skimpy.
and
that
is
charitable
as
i
can
be
about
those
particular
facts.
so
as
a
practical
matter,
our
big
defense
was
this
1941
statute
which
we
believe
is
constitutional.
and
the
question
is
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
this
particular
statute
unless
they
appeal.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
well,
i
represent
the
city
of
el
paso
and
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
well,
under
the
theory
that's
enunciated
by
the
fifth
circuit
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
it
appears
that
he
could
continue
to
do
that
until
some
third
party's
rights
had
intervened.
in
other
words,
their
theory
is
that
before
the
state
of
texas
could
terminate
this
contract
even
though
it's
in
default
admittedly
that
they
must
create
rights
in
another.
and
as
we
stated
this
common
knowledge,
the
state
of
texas
doesn't
sell
its
land
anymore.
it
did
back
in
1910
but
all
they
sell
them
in
very
rare
instances
but
under
the
theory
enunciated
by
the
fifth
circuit
before
these
rights
would
be
terminated,
the
state
would
have
to
create
rights
in
another.
and
now
the
decisions
of
the
texas
court
which
followed
out,
these
rights
would
have
to
write
them
into
a
patent.
and
we
submit
that
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
perpetually,
they
could
continue
to
fail
to
pay
the
interest,
so
long
as
the
title
remains
in
the
state.
i
might
briefly
call
the
court's
attention.
i
have
to
apologize
first
for
the
scrappiness
of
the
record.
we
both
move
for
summary
judgments
consequently
the
case
wouldn't
as
fully
developed
as
we
might
have
liked
in
the
trial
court.
but
the
particular
statute
involved
was
submitted
in
1941.
it's
chapter
191
of
the
acts
of
1941
of
the
texas
legislature.
that
particular
statute
is
in
two
parts.
the
first
part
provided
that
the
state
or
that
the
state
provided
that
any
purchaser
of
these
lands
could
defer
payments
of
the
principal
for
the
next
four
years.
the
second
part
of
the
statute
of
--
added
the
five-year
proviso.
and
as
mr.
simmons
has
pointed
out
in
his
brief,
the
state
of
texas
on
many,
many
occasions
have
amended
or
modified
this
--
these
land
acts.
the
most
common
type
of
modification
is
that
each
two
years,
the
state
provides
that
the
principal
payments
may
be
deferred
that
the
purchasers
need
only
pay
interest.
now,
the
record
shows,
i
believe,
that
mr.
simmons
predecessors
entitled
avail
themselves
of
the
first
section
of
this
particular
act
and
now
are
complaining
of
the
second
section.
we
think
it's
questionable
whether
they
actually
even
have
a
right
to
complain
since
they
avail
themselves
of
the
benefits
conferred
by
the
first
section
of
this
particular
act
and
now
they
complain
about
the
five-year
proviso
in
the
second
provision
of
the
act.
one
other
matter,
i
would
like
to
bring
up
this
time.
i
think
the
provi
--
and
that
is
the
appendix
k
that's
been
submitted
by
the
appellee
wherein
he
made
several
requests
for
admissions
while
this
case
was
pending
on
appeal
in
the
united
states
supreme
court.
and
as
he
shows
in
there,
we
filed
objections
to
these
requests
for
admissions
but
nevertheless
they
are
brought
here
in
the
record.
i
feel
that
they
have
absolutely
no
bearing
on
this
particular
case
at
this
particular
time.
i
would
further
point
out
that
in
conferences
between
myself
and
mr.
simmons'
local
counsel,
the
court
so
stated
they
all
might
as
would
be
held
in
advance.
we
practice
a
little
bit
more
informally
out
in
el
paso
when
we
don't
file
orders
of
everything
but
i
do
believe
that
the
--
the
so-called
facts
and
conclusions
set
forth
in
appendix
k
to
the
appellee's
brief
and
absolutely
no
bearing
on
this
particular
question.
i
would
like,
if
i
might,
to
reserve
the
bulk
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
however,
i
do
call
again
reiterate
that
this
position
of
the
appellant
that
this
particular
statute
merely
modified
the
remedy
by
which
the
state
of
texas
terminated
its
land
purchase
contractual
rights
and
did
not
impair
obligations
of
the
contract
between
the
state
of
texas
and
mr.
simmons'
predecessors
in
title.
i
will
concede,
however,
there
--
there
is
some
dicta
in
some
earlier
texas
cases
that
might
support
the
proposition
that
the
right
of
reinstatement
was
invested
right.
however,
i
submit
a
careful
reading
of
those
cases
will
reveal
that
they
are
merely
dicta.
the
statement
was
more
or
less
gratuitous
and
was
not
necessary
to
the
decision
of
the
case
pending.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
try
to
address
myself,
answer
some
of
the
questions
propounded
by
members
of
the
court.
first
question
is
how
long
that
the
contracts
have
been
in
default?
i
believe
the
record
shows
that
they
became
in
default
in
november
of
1950
--
1946.
also
the
method
of
distinguishing
aikins
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
yes
sir,
the
first
default
on
the
interest,
the
state
mailed
a
letter
to
the
last
known
address
of
these
particular
purchasers,
advice
them
of
the
fact
that
they
had
not
paid
the
interest
on
november
1,
1956
whenever
it
was
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
i'm
sorry,
it's
1946,
1946
whenever
it
was
due
and
advice
them
that
if
the
payments
were
made
--
not
made
by
the
21st
of
july
1947,
that
the
lands
would
be
forfeited.
shortly
thereafter,
after
the
particular
date
cited,
the
july
21,
1947
date,
the
land
commissioner
again
notified
these
people
at
their
last
known
address
advised
them
that
the
state
had
forfeited
the
lands
in
accordance
with
the
established
procedure
whereby
all
they
do
is
mark
on
the
file
record
that
the
land
is
forfeited
from
nonpayment
of
interest.
and
at
that
time,
submitted
them
a
summary
of
this
particular
statute
which
is
now
under
consideration,
explaining
how
they
would
have
to
reinstate
the
purchasers.
i
believe
--
does
that
answer
your
question,
your
honor?
mr.
william
j.
mounce
the
next
action
that
the
state
took
after
the
forfeiture
was
in
--
again
in
july
of
1952.
mr.
simmons
filed
an
application
for
reinstatement
which
incidentally
was
filed
pursuant
to
this
new
act
of
--
and
the
state
returned
his
applications,
and
his
checks,
and
told
him
that
the
application
came
too
late.
and
that's
the
last
action
that
the
state
took
as
far
as
i
am
aware
until
the
lands
were
sold
to
the
city
of
el
paso.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
in
june
of
1952.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
yes,
after
six
weeks
before
the
five
years
had
gone
up.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
well
two
days
af
-
after
the
five
years
had
elapsed.
the
question
is
not
completely
clear
in
the
record
but
i
think
it's
--
we
can
say
that
it
was
at
least
two
days
thereafter.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
this
occurred
in
1952,
the
action
was
in
july
1952.
the
action
was
filed
in
august
of
1961,
so
nine
years
later.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
well,
there
really
wasn't
much
possession
taken
and
i'd
be
quite
frank
with
you.
we
alleged
the
defense
of
adverse
possession
state
--
i
mean
the
city
of
el
paso
was
holding
record
title.
there
were
some
acts
of
possession
as
questionable
whether
they're
sufficient
to
sustain
a
defense
of
adverse
possession
because
the
particular
nature
of
this
land
is
raw
and
it's
undeveloped.
its
location
really
is
what
gives
you
its
primary
value.
now,
does
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
william
j.
mounce
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
pass
on
to
the
method
by
which
the
appellee
attempted
to
distinguish
agents.
it
states
that
these
matters
were
inclusive
in
the
contract.
i
don't
know
the
contract
was
not
set
forth
in
any
of
the
particular
cases
either
the
supreme
court
case
in
the
state
of
california
decision.
however,
i
think
that's
completely
immaterial
because
regardless
of
whether
they're
set
forth
verbatim
in
the
contract
itself,
people
contract
with
regard
to
existent
law.
i
think
that's
home
book
proposition
law
that
needs
no
particular
citation.
and
it
is
our
position
their
own
principle,
the
aikins
decision
cannot
be
distinguished
from
our
situation
as
a
matter
of
principle.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
well
as
far
as
the
--
as
far
as
i
can
tell
from
any
decision,
i
haven't
seen
the
particular
contract
involved
in
aikins
but
the
decision
says
that
the
only
obligations
were,
one,
that
the
purchaser
would
pay
the
purchase
price
and
two,
upon
payment
in
full
that
the
state
would
issue
a
patent
for
the
land.
now,
i
assume
they
are
the
same
because
aikins
caught
in
a
favor
of
the
two
supreme
court
cases
which
decided
a
texas
purchase
contract
which
says
essentially
the
same
thing
that
those
with
the
obligations
contained
in
a
texas
land
purchase
agreement
that
one,
the
purchaser
pays
the
money,
and
two,
whenever
he
did
that,
that
the
state
would
issue
a
patent.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
and
the
interest,
yes.
whenever
i
say
money,
i
mean
all
sum
to
do
under
the
agreement.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
it
changes
the
obligation
because
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
i
believe
it
is
under
an
obligation
at
that
time.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
i
don't
believe
that
that
was
the
contract.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
i
mean
--
sir?
mr.
william
j.
mounce
well,
they
had
a
contract
whereby
he
would
pay
for
the
land
and
want
to
repay
for
the
land
and
statement
sell
it
but
i
don't
think
the
method
by
which
the
state
terminated
this
contractual
relationship
with
him
was
necessarily
a
part
of
the
contract.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
well,
to
change
the
procedure,
why
by
which
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
well,
as
far
as
he
was
concerned,
it
terminated
his
contractual
rights
at
the
end
of
the
five-year
period.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
if
the
law
had
not
been
in
effect,
and
under
these
circumstances,
i
believe
that
he
would
have
still
had
a
right
to
purchase
the
land.
now
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
under
the
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
under
of
the
contract
and
the
policy
then
in
effect
by
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
well,
i
don't
think
this
was
necessarily
a
contractual
provision
and
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
i
think
there's
more
policy
and
a
remedial
provision
remedy
by
which
the
state
terminated
this
con
--
terminated
or
did
not
terminate
the
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
--
contract.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
well
except
the
--
well
at
one
premise
that
i
think
you're
wrong,
all
the
contracts
are
absolutely
good.
he
was
in
default,
something
you
have
to
keep
in
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
yes
it
did
provide.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
it
provided
that
at
that
time,
if
he
paid
up
the
reinstated
his
purchase
in
accordance
with
the
statutes
and
no
intervening
rights
of
third
parties
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
no,
there's
no
procedure
or
any
right
for
by
the
statement
to
do
that.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
well,
i'm
saying
that
just
like
aikins
said
that
--
that's
the
same
situation
we
had
in
the
aikins
case.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
i
believe
it
was.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
well,
they
don't
--
well
on
the
obligation
of
the
contract
but
they
do
say
this
that
at
the
title
of
the
contract,
the
way
the
state
would
terminate
these
contractual
rights
was
this.
it
would
file
a
lawyer's
--
essentially
a
quiet
title
action.
and
after
the
--
if
the
state
got
a
judgment,
then
the
purchaser
would
have
20
days
after
entry
of
that
particular
judgment
within
which
to
come
in
and
pay
up
all
back
moneys
plus
court
cost.
and
then
he
would
get
his
land
back.
now,
that's
--
i
can
see
no
real
material
distinction
between
what
we
have
here.
the
state
of
california
lend
them
a
minute,
their
action
said
they
didn't
have
to
file
a
quiet
title
action
at
all.
if
the
guy
had
--
the
purchaser
had
been
in
default
for
a
certain
length
of
the
time
five
--
which
incidentally
was
five
years,
if
he
didn't
come
in
within
60
days
from
the
date
to
processes
this
act
and
pay
--
and
reinstate
his
purchase,
he
lost
all
claim
to
the
land.
and
that's
essentially
what
we
have
here.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
yes
sir,
he
did.
i
again
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
mr.
sim
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
no
sir.
but
we
have
one
other
factor
here.
as
i
mentioned,
before
this
particular
statute
has
been
--
these
land
acts
have
been
amended
numerous
times.
this
--
and
again,
i
call
your
attention
with
the
fact
that
this
particular
amendment
provided
that
in
--
the
principle
payments
need
not
be
paid.
i
don't
think
you
find
them
set
out,
quoted
verbatim
in
the
brief
of
the
record,
your
honor.
but
that
the
record
does
show
that
mr.
simmons
as
predecessors
of
title
avail
themselves
of
this
particular
section
of
the
statute
and
nearly
made
an
interest
payment
rather
than
paying
their
principal
as
the
so-called
--
as
the
contract
--
contract
provided.
they
avail
themselves
the
benefit
of
the
particular
statute
and
now
they
refuse
to
buy
it
by
the
burdens
of
the
statute.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
well
i
don't
think
--
i
know
that's
exactly
what
he
claimed,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
--
bid
by
disagreement.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
yes
and
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
i
think
it's
an
obligation
on
both
parties.
i
think
it's
an
obligation
on
part
of
the
purchaser
to
pay
the
money
and
an
obligation
of
the
state
to
issue
a
patent
after
the
money
has
been
paid.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
yes,
i
think
you
might
say
that
even
the
times
he
had
agreed
to
pay
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
well,
i
--
i'm
not
sure
that
i
agree
with
you,
with
that
statement.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
well,
we
get
back
to
the
point
again
whether
this
was
part
of
the
obligation
of
that
particular
contract.i
say
and
i
submit
that
it
was
not
necessarily
a
part
of
the
obligation
of
the
contract
because
of
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
the
obligation
impo
--
it
was
fixed
by
the
contract.
i
think
it
was
as
far
as
obligation
is
concerned.
i
--
i
again
submit
that
this
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
well,
if
you're
going
to
call
that
an
obligation
i
can't
distinguish
from
it.
but
i
still
submit
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
well
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
well,
they
agreed
to
give
him
a
patent
if
he
paid
his
money.
that's
what
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
well,
these
particular
terms
and
conditions
weren't
set
out
in
the
contract.
they
were
in
the
part
of
the
body
of
the
law
at
the
time.
so
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
i
think
--
i
think
so.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
yes
sir.
but
i
still
think
the
question
is
whether
this
five-year
limitation
feature
is
part
of
the
remedy
by
which
the
state
terminates
these
agreements
are
part
of
the
actual
contractual
obligation
itself.
and
again,
i
say
that
they
cannot
be
distinguished
logically
so
between
the
wilson
versus
flack
in
the
standefer
case
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
the
aikins
versus
kingsbury.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
well
i
--
i
don't
know
that
this
is
--
i
don't
know
that
i'd
say
this
is
alright
or
not
because
it
won't
(voice
overlap)
change
in
the
remedies
where
the
remedy
itself
has
reaped
the
--
what
is
left
is
reasonable.
mr.
william
j.
mounce
i
don't
know
the
answer
quite
frankly
to
your
question
if
it
was
10
or
20.
i
don't
know
whether
it'd
be
reasonable
or
not.
i
think
the
reason
of
mine
might
differ
as
to
the
reason
and
so
that
particular
change
--
mr.
william
j.
mounce
yes,
they
did
and
i
think
it's
reasonable.
