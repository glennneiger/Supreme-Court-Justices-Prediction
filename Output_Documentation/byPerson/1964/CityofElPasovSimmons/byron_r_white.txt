so
you
would
argue
then
that
if
the
original
contract
had
expressly
said
that
you
may
reinstate
within
the
period
of
10
years
after
forfeiture
is
declared,
if
that's
what
the
law
was
when
the
contract
was
made
and
then
the
state
changed
the
law
after
later
which
says
that
you
may
reinstate
within
five
years,
you
would
say
that's
forfeited?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
just
a
remedy
though,
although
i
say
it
was
20
years
and
they
cut
it
down
to
10,
just
to
remedy.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
here
they
could
change
in
five
years.
