mr.
greenberry
simmons
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we've
referred
a
great
deal
recently
about
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
american
indians,
and
we
have
also
heard
a
great
deal
about
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
american
negroes.
but
very
seldom
that
in
this
court
do
we
have
the
opportunity
to
direct
our
attention
to
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
american
settlers
that
helped
settled
up
this
western
boundaries
with
reference
to
their
homes
and
their
home
sites.
this
is
such
a
suit.
we
have
gone
into
focus
here
the
impairment
of
the
obligation
of
contract
article
i,
section
10
of
the
constitution
of
which
the
members
of
this
court
know
long
before
well
provides
that
no
state
shall
pass
any
act
impairing
the
obligation
of
contract.
now,
since
that
was
put
in,
in
this
constitution
of
ours,
it
has
lost
a
great
deal
of
its
potentiality.
however,
in
regards
to
land
grants
by
the
state
and
contracts
pertaining
to
land
grants
by
the
state
and
the
government,
it
still
carries
a
quite
of
great
deal
of
potentiality.
now,
before
we
can
determine
whether
this
contract
has
been
impaired,
we
of
course
have
to
determine
what
the
obligations
of
both
parties
were
at
the
time
the
contract
was
made
back
in
1910,
not
and
under
the
laws
at
that
time,
not
under
the
laws
as
they
might
be
today
after
being
amended
so
many
times.
now,
on
page
67
of
the
record
--
67
of
the
record,
we
have
the
contract
which
is
before
the
court
today.
that
contract
was
made
by
settlers
glenn
and
kilpatrick
in
1910,
when
it
applied
to
the
state
of
texas
for
the
purchase
of
their
homes
and
their
home
sites.
found
down
here
about
a
third
of
the
page
from
the
bottom,
we
have
the
word
which
is
hidden
here
o-b-l-i-g-a-t-i-o-n
and
of
course
the
obligation
of
this
contract
is
from
there
on
down
with
reference
to
the
statutes
they
refer
to.
now,
what
does
the
obligation
of
this
contract
specifically
express
and
stipulate
as
to
the
terms
of
the
obligation
itself.
that's
what
we're
--
we're
trying
to
find
out
here,
the
obligation
itself.
i
have
this
day
prchased
from
the
state
of
texas
under
the
provisions
of
and
in
accordance
with,
and
let
me
emphasize
that,
under
the
provisions
of
and
in
accordance
with
chapter
129
of
the
acts
of
may
19,
1897,
now
there
it
is
in
the
obligation
of
the
contract.
now,
what
does
chapter
129
say
pertaining
to
the
particular
thing
which
is
before
this
court
today
namely
the
reinstatement
of
property
which
was
already
forfeited.
at
page
8
of
the
brief
for
the
appellee,
page
8.
there
is
set
out
two
paragraphs
there
which
take
--
which
is
part
of
chapter
129
which
set
out
the
obligations
of
both
parties,
the
settlers
and
their
vendees,
and
the
state
of
texas.
now,
what
does
it
say?
in
the
second
paragraph
here
it
says,
this
land
is
to
be
sold
to
settlers,
actual
settlers
only.
and
after
they
have
spent
three
years
on
their
lands,
they
may
have
a
patent
at
anytime.
now,
that's
fairly
clear.
i'm
speaking
now
of
the
obligation
of
this
contract,
not
just
the
contract
itself,
the
obligation
of
this
contract
stipulated
and
expressed.
what
else
does
it
say
pertaining
to
this
subject
that
we
want
to
talk
about?
it
says,
if
any
of
these
lands
are
forfeited
for
the
nonpayment
of
interest,
they
may
be
reinstated
by
the
purchaser
or
the
vendee
by
paying
all
back
interest
into
the
treasury
and
by
giving
written
notice
before
the
rights
of
third
parties
may
have
intervened.
that
means
before
this
date
sold
that
land
to
a
third
party.
now,
what
we
have
just
discussed
here
are
the
obligations
of
the
state
to
do
certain
things.
what?
if
these
settlers
pay
their
back
interest
before
they
resell
it
to
some
third
person,
then
what?
this
contract
comes
back
into
being
just
the
same
as
it
was
when
it's
written.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
well,
that
is
so
--
mr.
greenberry
simmons
mr.
chief
justice,
you
mean
when
you're
taking
generally
or
in
this
particular
case?
mr.
greenberry
simmons
in
this
particular
case
sir,
it
was
tendered.
it
was
tendered.
all
back
interest
was
tendered
and
i'm
coming
of
course
with
all
back
interest
was
tendered,
that's
the
whole
point
in
the
case.
all
back
interest
was
tendered
and
request
was
made
to
reinstate
before
the
state
sold
to
the
city
three
years
and
a
half
before
the
city.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
if
the
state
did
not
sell
it
to
the
city.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
well
--
mr.
greenberry
simmons
well
--
oh,
you
mean
after
it
had
been
forfeited
back
to
the
state?
now,
after
it
had
been
forfeited
back
to
the
state
for
nonpayment
of
interest
--
mr.
greenberry
simmons
yes,
yes,
and
if
--
that's
right.
and
it
would
be
indefinite
until
they
sold
that
land
before
and
--
and
the
reason
is
very
good
about
that.
it
was
customary
down
there
for
these
settlers
when
they
moved
on
this
land
to
pay
for
years
and
then
all
at
once,
and
i'm
coming
to
that
in
a
few
minutes,
all
at
once
not
able
to
pay
their
interest.
they
didn't
get
off
the
land
then.
it
was
only
when
they
resold
that
land
because
you
have
got
a
statute
here
which
they
contracted
in
the
obligation
to
do
the
terms
of
the
contract.
and
it
--
and
as
long
as
they
held
that
land,
they
could
--
while
they
have
lived
on
this
land
for
40
or
50
years
as
a
whole
--
and
for
a
long
period
of
time.
then
the
successors,
the
vendees
went
in
the
same
position.
yes
sir,
that's
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
they
had
that
right.
that's
exactly
what
they
held
that
they
--
this
was
not
a
remedy
but
it
was
an
obligation
of
the
state
right
here.
now,
if
it
had
been
customary
--
well,
of
course
customary,
we're
not
interested
in
customary.
too
much
in
regards
to
this
matter.
but
anyway
they
did
not
have
to
--
they
generally
did
not
move
on
if
they
didn't
pay.
it
was
only
after
they
resold,
they
lived
there
with
the
expectation
for
years.
now
--
mr.
greenberry
simmons
a
vendee
under
this
statute
has
identically
the
same
--
yes
sir,
yes
your
honor.
well
--
no
we're
arguing,
yes
we're
arguing
for
this
vendee
and
the
settler
come
--
the
settler
and
the
vendee
have
identical.
they
have
identical
rights
given
to
him
by
the
--
by
this
contract
it
says
here
purchaser
or
vendee.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
that's
right
and
it's
done
--
been
done
and
the
books
are
full
of
it.
this
is
not
any
novel
thing.
this
is
--
even
in
the
court
of
appeals
sets
that
out
in
its
opinion.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
well,
if
it
was
questioned,
lots
of
times
it
didn't
question.
they
go
on
and
sell
it.
i
mean,
when
they
get
ready
--
no
under
--
when
this
statute
was
passed,
they
had
due
settled.
they
--
they
--
for
years,
the
statutes
provided
that
they
--
they
will
sell
the
land
on
the
next
sale
or
something
like
that.
and
they
--
they
--
it
was
accustomed
to
--
and
the
--
in
the
statute.
the
statute
now
i'm
talking
about
the
--
the
obligations
here
of
the
state,
not
just
the
--
the
statute
itself.
i
mean
--
mr.
greenberry
simmons
well,
mr.
justice
gold
--
yes
mr.
justice
goldberg,
it's
covered
right
here
in
the
statute
which
is
the
terms
of
the
contr
--
obligation
of
the
contract
itself.
it's
in
the
terms
of
the
obligation.
it's
covered
there.
it
says
that
exactly,
what
does
it
say?
it
says
a
purchaser
or
their
vendees
may
have
their
claims
reinstated
on
written
request
by
paying
to
the
treasure
for
the
full
amount
of
interest
due
upon
such
claim
up
to
the
date
of
reinstatement
provided
no
rights
of
third
parties
may
have
intervened.
now,
that
is
not
just
our
dream.
that
is
not
just
the
statute.
that
is
the
obligation
of
these
terms
of
this
contract
and
that's
just
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
this
case.
that's
exactly
--
mr.
greenberry
simmons
the
statute
--
yes,
statute
has
been
changed
--
yes,
yes
your
honor
--
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
yes.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
1952,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
well
it
was
--
mr.
greenberry
simmons
i
mean
according
to
the
--
evidently
according
to
something
it
was
yes
--
yes,
i
--
mr.
greenberry
simmons
i
know
that,
but
that
statute
was
passed
if
you're
speaking
of,
it
was
passed,
it
was
passed
some
30
years
after
this
contract
was
made.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
well,
here
it
is
and
the
obligation
of
the
contract
right
here.
i
mean
in
regards
to
--
mr.
greenberry
simmons
and
then
in
1941
and
1951,
yes,
those
acts
were
--
they
were
amended
but
they
have
been
amended
several
times
since
then.
if
we
--
we
came,
that's
right.
that's
been
amended
several
times
since
then.
but
how
can
you
change
the
terms
of
your
obligation,
the
terms
of
your
obligation
by
any
statute,
regardless
of
what
its
remedy
or
substance,
you
cannot
do
that
under
the
courts,
i
mean
under
this
court's
rulings.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
the
state
didn't
own
the
prop
--
any
property
subject
to
the
obligation
of
this
statute.
the
state
did
that
--
when
--
when
it
was
forfeited,
it
went
back
to
the
school
fund.
and
if
the
state
at
that
time
had
sold
to
the
city
before
we
pay
that
interest
where
they
would
have
the
title,
but
they
didn't
do
it.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
they
--
they
didn't
tell
it
--
sell
it
until
the
settler
himself
had
paid
everything
he
owed.
i
mean
it
tendered
it,
tendered
everything
he
owed.
he
was
living
white
when
these
people
bought
this
land.
this
contract
was
just
in
good
condition
as
it
ever
was
when
it
was
made
that
the
date
that
that
--
i
think
i'm
so
--
right,
soon
as
this
money
was
tendered
right
here
it
says,
“if
you
do
that,
then
that
is
the
obligation
of
--
it's
not
just
the
contract,
it's
--“
mr.
greenberry
simmons
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
they
imposed
a
--
a
statute
limitation,
nothing
but
a
remedy,
nothing
but
a
remedy
in
the
world
that
--
that
five-year
limitation,
but
you
can't
even
impose
a
remedy,
if
you
have
contracted
in
the
terms
of
the
obligation.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
yes
we're
saying
that
that
impaired
after
this
contract
was
made
and
while
this
was
customary
down
in
texas,
there's
--
there's
this
any
unusual
thing
that
they'll
try
to
pull
of
it.
texas
jurisprudence
has
followed
these
and
--
and
--
did
i
answer
that?
mr.
greenberry
simmons
well
if
you
--
they
--
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
that's
how
it
is
--
that's
exactly
what
we
are
saying.
we
are
saying
that
if
the
terms
of
the
obligation
itself
--
mr.
greenberry
simmons
yes
but
we're
saying
--
mr.
greenberry
simmons
that's
right
and
we
say
you
can't
put
that
on
because
not
because
it
--
i
mean
because
that
you
have
contracted
back
there
and
these
people
have
lived
on
this
land.
they
built
their
homes
on
this
land,
taken
money
out
of
their
pockets
and
built
their
homes
on
this
land
which
the
state
had
nothing
to
do
with,
paid
interest
on
this
contract
for
37
years
before
this.
and
then
was
unable
to
pay
the
--
the
interest.
and
what
--
and
then
it
merely
reverted
to
the
state
with
the
right
to
them
to
sell
it
anytime
they
didn't
--
that
the
settler
didn't
come
in,
but
the
settlers
and
the
vendees
came
in.
they
came
in
three
years
and
a
half
before
their
city.
and
they
paid
up.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
well
your
--
your
honor
please,
they
had
five
--
i
think
maybe
five
years
and
maybe
one
or
two
days
there's
a
discussion
there
about
when
they
received
it,
and
what
day
it
was,
and
that's
i
think
--
mr.
greenberry
simmons
well
these
two
cases
are
the
same.
i
mean
yes.
this
is
the
same
and
this
is
yes
--
these
are
identically
the
same,
the
contracts
is
the
same.
and
that's
right,
the
settlers.
and
that's
--
mr.
greenberry
simmons
well
excuse
me
mr.
--
excuse
me
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
well,
the
court
of
appeals,
of
course,
they
cited
that
case
and
that's
the
first
time
that
this
--
this
city
had
ever
presented
that
case.
when
the
court
of
appeals
cited
it
in
their
opinion
and
still
ruled
against
them,
but
of
course
here
is
the
--
here
is
the
--
yes,
the
difference.
the
terms
of
this
contract
here
are
different
than
the
redemption
statute
that
was
in
the
california
statute.
the
california
statute
did
not
provide
so
far
as
we
can
see
in
the
case
and
here
it
is,
we
can't
find
where
the
statute
in
the
california
case
provided
the
same
things
in
the
obligation
of
the
contract
itself;
namely,
to
reinstate
if
they
paid
up
before
this
result.
they
didn't
have
that
in
the
obligation
stipulated
in
the
obligation,
in
the
aikins
case.
i
mean
we
can't
find
if
it's
in
there.
it
merely
says
that
in
20
days,
it's
an
ordinary
redemption
case.
this
is
not
an
ordinary
redemption
case.
this
is
not
an
ordinary,
just
an
ordinary.
you
pay
interest
and
we
give
you
patent.
you
can
see
that
this
is
a
--
this
is
an
altogether
different
situation.
why?
and
you
can
see
it
by
what
they
have
--
the
state
has
agreed
to
do
in
this
case.
if
you
come
on
this
land
with
eight
inches
of
rain
on
it,
and
--
and
live
on
it,
and
build
your
home
on
it
a
year,
average
mean
eight
inches,
we
will
do
this
for
you.
and
now
they're
trenching
on
it
after
the
men
live
on
it,
and
build
their
homes,
and
did
this.
the
state
has
time
to
flitch
and
say,
“no,
that
was
not
the
contract.
we
have
entered
just
a
remedy.”
it
was
more
than
a
remedy
and
the
court
of
appeals
so
held
it
was
more
than
a
remedy.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
well
yes.
now
it
didn't.
that
is
right.
it's
right
except
everything,
your
honor
please,
if
you
--
they
didn't
say
this
in
the
aikins
case
right
here.
“that
you
may
have
your
property
back
if
you
pay
interest
before
we
resell
it,”
if
you
can
find
that
in
the
aikins
case,
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
it.
and
that
is
the
expressed
and
stipulated
terms
of
the
obligation
itself.
that's
not
just
a
contract.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
i
think
they
probably
invest
(voice
overlap).
i
think
there
are
parts
here.
but
here's
the
news
--
mr.
greenberry
simmons
that's
the
language
and
--
and
the
obligation
of
this
contract
is
that
whether
this
is
a
remedy
or
whether
this
is
substance,
or
even
procedure.
they
contracted
their
right
away
in
the
obligation
of
this
contract.
now
we
had
--
this
the
--
we
have
several
cases
of
course,
when
we
come
to
them.
i
mean
this
court
has
held.
the
principle
that
i
--
we
are
going
on
your
honors
please
is
as
old
as
mr.
chief
justice
john
marshall's
court
in
1823.
it's
green
against
biddle.
and
it
said
if
the
terms
of
the
contract
itself
now
if
--
and
it's
cited
on
page,
the
last
page,
54
in
this
appendix
d.
if
the
terms
of
the
obligation
or
the
terms
of
the
contract
itself
says
certain
things
even
though
their
remedies,
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it's
a
remedy
or
whether
it's
substance.
if
the
terms
of
the
obligation
say
so,
then
any
--
and
what
does
the
constitution
say?
it
says
on
page
two
right
here,
is
--
is
of
course
i
know
that
--
that
your
honors
are
all
familiar
with
it
but
we
have
--
might
reflect
a
recollection.
"no
state
shall
pass
any
--
shall
pass
any
law
impairing
the
obligation
of
contract.”
now,
we
are
trying
--
we
found
out
what
the
obligation
is
here.
now,
if
it
is
in
where
--
here
is
--
here
has
been
in
the
trouble.
the
problem
that
we
most
have
had
in
the
past
with
these
cases
in
all
these
hu
--
history
of
this
--
this
court,
is
searching
out
what
the
obligation
of
the
contracts
are.
now,
if
the
oblig
--
if
we
can't
find
that
in
the
obligation
itself,
then
what
you
say
of
course
--
what
we
are
saying,
then
they
can
amend,
and
then
they
can
deal
with
remedies.
but
if
we
have
stipulated
and
if
we
do
find
in
the
obligation
itself
like
we
find
this
language
here
what
to
do,
then
that
is
different
that
then
even
if
you
--
if
you
have
stipulated,
you're
about
it,
it
can't
then
be
impaired
in
anyway.
that's
what
it
said,
that
if
the
obligation
covers
it,
that
it's
covered
in
the
obligation,
you
can't
--
we
can't
pass
any
law
that
shall
impair
it.
but
now
just
the
--
we
have
to
tell
a
little
of
what
these
sellers
did
i
think
on
this
land
before.
i
mean
they
--
they
went
on
the
land
and
they
built
a
house,
and
they
spent
three
years,
and
they
got
a
certificate
of
three-year
residence
all
of
these
is
in
the
--
in
the
record
of
this
case.
and
everything
is
certified
copies.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
well,
the
nature
of
the
land
today,
its
--
its
suburban
--
expensive
suburban
land
but
the
water
has
been
discovered
on
it
and
it's
a
valuable
land.
it's
valuable,
a
big
highway
has
been
put
to
it
and
it's
a
valuable
land.
it's
got
life
in
the
settlers
went
on
it.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
yes,
suburban
el
paso
just
somewhat
that
outside
the
city
limits
with
straight
--
big
highway
going
straight
to
it
and
has
water
under
it,
you
shall
love
it,
has
--
and
it's
--
it's
not
likened
was
when
the
settlers
started
down
on
this
land.
all
--
mr.
greenberry
simmons
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
no
it
isn't
a
public
park,
your
honor.
it's
just
land.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
no,
the
--
the
titles
according
to
the
record
belongs
to
simmons.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
i
--
and
el
paso
got
a
patent
three
years
and
a
half
after
we
recorded
our
titles
to
it.
three
years
and
a
half,
there's
subsequent
persons
that's
constructed
notice
in
addition
to
this,
and
first
in
right
and
--
oh
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
well,
it
isn't
being
used
--
that
isn't
being
used,
it's
not
even
in
the
setting.
it's
on
the
edge
of
the
city.
the
city
bought
all
--
it's
not
even
in
the
--
in
the
city.
it's
on
the
edge.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
no,
your
honor.
the
city
is
in
regards
to
this
is
in
the
land
business.
that's
just
what
it
is.
that's
just
what
this
massive
selling
of
some
of
these
lands
and
they
--
they
--
and
they
haven't
drilled
on
a
bit
of
this
land
for
water.
so
far
as
our
information
is
concerned,
certainly
i'm
not
--
none
of
this,
none
of
these
two
sections
directed
to
show.
well
--
mr.
greenberry
simmons
no,
it
hasn't
been
subdivided
but
there
are
some
subdivisions
in
the
area
and
--
mr.
greenberry
simmons
yes.
mr.
greenberry
simmons
yes.
that's
right.
i
mean
that's
what
it
amounts
to.
i
mean
of
course,
the
--
the
home
sites
had,
you
know,
the
home
site
that
the
sellers
put
on
there,
there'll
be
homes
in
there
when
they
went
on
there
--
and
dug
wells
and
have
been
prove
to
popped
in
that
sort
of
thing
and
lived
for
a
while
and
then
hard
times
came
like
the
depression
came
here
and
--
and
so
they
moved
off.
and
that's
the
way
that
--
that's
what
i
was
going
to
tell
you
about
when
we
started
out
that
--
that's
the
way
it
goes
along
until
they
--
they
loose
it
and
then
i
mean
it
goes
back
to
the
state.
this
is
no
news
case.
i
mean
the
--
the
gulf
reduction
case
is
the
leading
case
in
texas
on
this
that
--
that
the
state
law
has
taken
million
dollars
on
160
acres
in
that
case.
this
is
--
and
that
is
the
leading
case
there.
gulf
reduction
recites
that
case.
i
think
the
difficulty
that
--
mr.
greenberry
simmons
well,
of
course,
the
court
of
appeals
though
affirm
this,
i
mean
said
what
we
said
a
while
ago.
i
was
going
to
say
that
you
almost
have
to
understand
the
setting
of
this
thing
of
how
those
settlers
went
on
right
here
and
demand
and
why
texas
was
willing
to
do
this
when
they
started
out.
they
couldn't
get
back
at
the
turn
of
the
century
when
this
--
this
statute
is
passed
in
1897.
they
couldn't
get
any
money
to
stay
on
that
land
and
that's
really
the
trouble.
so
that's
where
we
made
the
statute.
that's
when
they
obligated
themselves
like
this.
and
these
people
went
on
and
stayed
there.
and
of
course,
there's
no
doubt
about
the
--
the
new
jersey
case
of
wilson
if
--
if
we
have
the
same
identical
rights
that
the
--
that
the
--
the
settler
had.
and
we
submit
that
the
court,
the
law
should
be
affirmed
the
decision.
