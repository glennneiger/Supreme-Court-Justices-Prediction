simmons.
mr.
mounce.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mounce,
under
your
theory,
how
long
could
you
find
have
continued
to
fail
to
pay
the
interest
and
still
have
enjoyed
the
use
of
the
property.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
yes
--
yes
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
i
meant
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
so
long
as
remained
in
the
--
in
the
ownership
of
the
state,
they
could
continue
to
fail
to
pay
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
simmons.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
mean
that
if
you
--
if
you
continued
to
fail
to
pay
the
interest
and
the
state
never
divested
itself
in
favor
of
another
party
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
you
could
continue
that
in
that
at
the
end
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'm
talking
about
what
would
happen
in
this
particular
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
i
--
i'm
wondering
what
would
happen
if
the
--
if
the
state
did
not
sell
to
the
city.
could
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
indefinitely
have
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
failed
to
pay
the
interest
and
still
maintain
your
property?
chief
justice
earl
warren
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
do
with
the
case
of
aikins
versus
kingsbury
in
247
u.s.(voice
overlap)
on
the
theory
of
cases
the
counsel
drew
along
that
line?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
say
how
do
you
handle
the
aikins
versus
kingsbury
in
247
u.s.
and
the
other
cases
that
counsel
cites
along
the
line?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
isn't
that
what
happened
in
aikins?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
they
purchased
it
at
the
--
in
the
lights
of
the
statute
in
california,
didn't
they,
in
aikins?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
purchased
to
them
the
light
of
the
statute
in
aikins,
did
they
not?
well,
that
was
written
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
is
the
language
that
i
wanted
--
what
you
--
what
you
--
how
would
you
handle
it.
the
counsel
quotes
this
language
from
that
case.
“the
right
of
the
state
to
foreclose
such
a
contract
for
default
in
payment
and
the
right
of
the
purchaser
to
redeem
after
a
default
decree
relate
to
the
remedy
as
distinguished
from
the
obligation
of
the
contract
and
both
of
these
rights
are
constitutionally
subject
to
modification
by
the
state
within
limits
which
were
not
exceeded
in
the
act
before
us.”
now
that's
the
language
that
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
finish
such
statement
you
are
going
to
make,
mr.
simmons.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
mounce.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
trace
through
the
actions
of
the
state
from
--
from
the
time
that
they
first
defaulted
on
the
interest,
what
was
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
not
1956
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
what
--
what
was
the
next
action
the
state
took?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
when
did
--
when
did
mr.
simmons
buy
--
become
the
federal
owner
of
the
property?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
1952,
just
before
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
when
--
when
was
the
author
made
to
repay
the
interest?
chief
justice
earl
warren
apparently
two
days
after
the
five-year
period.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
the
--
in
election
of
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
when
was
this
action
filed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
was
in
possession
with
property
in
the
meantime?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
it
does.
