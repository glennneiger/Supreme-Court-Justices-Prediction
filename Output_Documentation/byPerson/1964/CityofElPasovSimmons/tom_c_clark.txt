justice
tom
c.
clark
and
then
send
it
back
to
the
district
court?
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
have
been
changed
though,
was
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
state
forfeited
the
land
for
nonpayment
in
1947,
is
that
right?
justice
tom
c.
clark
then
you
can
earn
your
money
under
the
act
in
1953.
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
that
was
two
days
later
or
something
like
that,
wasn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
according
to
the
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
he
was
qualified
in
1941
with
that
statute.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
understand
that.
you
claim
that
that
statute
is
a
nullity
because
it
impairs
what
you
claim
to
be
a
contract
under
your
original
settlement.
and
the
statute
was
that
--
that
was
then
in
effect
but
did
not
have
the
five-year
limitation.
that's
your
position,
isn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
tom
c.
clark
those
statements
say
that
they
had
the
right
to
amend
the
statute
with
reference
to
forfeiture
for
nonpayment.
and
that
that's
all
it
did.
they
--
you
would
not
pay
for
many
years,
the
statute
was
amended
in
1941,
and
you
forfeit
your
land
in
1947,
and
stated
more,
so
state
claims
i
suppose
that
after
1947
that
they'd
own
these
properties.
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
didn't
sell
it
until
'55.
justice
tom
c.
clark
it's
a
public
park?
justice
tom
c.
clark
it's
a
public
park
or
what
is
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
it
belongs
to
el
paso.
justice
tom
c.
clark
it
belongs
to
el
paso?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
mean
el
paso
claims
it.
justice
tom
c.
clark
where
they
use
it
for?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
there
are
papers
that
the
city
has
bought
from
the
state
a
large
crack
of
which
this
were
part,
i
thought
perhaps
it
might
be
a
part.
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
haven't
been
subdivided,
have
they?
justice
tom
c.
clark
this
land
is
exactly
to
go?
justice
tom
c.
clark
nothing
of
is
standing
here.
