c.
clark
mr.
solicitor
general,
what
is
the
relevancy
of
the
disparity
in
the
educational
systems
to
this
point
you
are
not
(voice
overlap)
justice
tom
c.
clark
even
if
that
test
were
equally
applied?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you're
familiar
with
california
--
united
states
against
california?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
distinguished
the
case?
justice
tom
c.
clark
no,
no.
that's
the
one
where
the
congress
refused
to
give
the
attorney
general
the
right
to
sue
and
then
he
went
into
court
anyway.
justice
tom
c.
clark
so
you're
stating
there
that
the
government
explained
--
the
federal
government
explained
in
parallel,
the
property.
justice
tom
c.
clark
that's
what
i
distinguished
to
be
permissible.
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
distinction
you
could
rely
--
you
can
present
argument
on
but
it
was
not
sub
silentio.
it
was
previously
argued.
they
vigorously
argued
on
both
sides
and
decided
within
the
court's
opinion.
the
attorney
general
did
have
power
to
protect
the
government's
interest.
i
haven't
argued
that
case,
have
i?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
the
attorney
general
can
file
a
suit.
justice
tom
c.
clark
it
was
argued.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
i
think
subject
to
the
evidence
where
it
stated
in
the
infringement
of
federal
right
of
the
attorney
general
without
any
authorization
and
filed
a
suit
to
correct
that
wrong.
i
merely
first
filed
that
suit
in
the
trial
court
and
get
then
that
you
could
get.
and
they
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
decision
against
the
state.
now,
we
dismiss
that
from
here
that's
why
with
the
question
on
how
you
distinguish
this
case.
