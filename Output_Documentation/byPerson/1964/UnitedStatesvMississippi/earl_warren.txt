versus
mississippi
et

mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
they
could
have
sued
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
clark.
chief
justice
earl
warren
doesn't
--
mr.
clark,
doesn't
this
section
that
you've
just
been
talking
about
provide
for
two
different
situations,
one
that
says
that
they
may
join
the
state
with
the
offending
officer
and
if
prior
to
the
institution
of
a
proceeding
such
official
has
resigned
or
has
been
relieved
to
his
office
and
no
successor
assume
such
office,
the
prosecution
--
the
proceeding
may
be
instituted
against
the
state.
now,
doesn't
that
--
aren't
they
dealing
with
two
different
actual
situations
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
one,
where
he
is
a
law
office
where
they
can
join
the
state
with
him
and
the
other
one
where
there
is
no
officer
and
they
can
sue
the
state
alone.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
talking
about
the
constitutional
concept.
i'm
talking
about
the
language
of
the
section
itself.
does
the
language
clearly
imply
two
different
actual
situations
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
let's
just
--
let's
just
read
it.
whenever
a
proceeding
instituted
under
this
subsection
any
official
of
the
state
or
subdivision
thereof
is
alleged
to
have
committed
in
any
act
or
practice
constituting
a
depravation
of
any
right
or
privilege
secured
by
subsection
a
of
this
section.
the
act
or
practice
shall
also
be
deemed
that
of
the
state.
and
the
state
may
be
joined
as
a
party
defendant.
now,
if
it
stopped
right
there,
wouldn't
you
say
that
in
filing
an
action
against
the
officer
that
they
could
also
file
against
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
all
right.
(voice
overlap)
now,
it
goes
on
though
and
it
says,
“and
if
prior
to
the
institution
of
such
proceeding,
such
official
has
resigned
or
has
been
relieved
to
his
office
and
no
successor
has
assumed
such
office,
the
proceeding
may
be
instituted
against
the
state”.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
how
--
how
do
you
derive
from
that
if
the
congress
hasn't
set
that
the
state
may
be
joined
with
the
offending
officials?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
because
--
because
if
there
is
no
--
if
there
is
no
individual
who
can
be
sued
because
he
is
out
of
office
then
the
government
can
proceed
solely
against
the
state.
but
otherwise,
he
can
--
the
state
can
be
joined
with
the
offending
officer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
well,
i
just
inquire
of
you
if
it
doesn't
have
that
plain
meaning.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we
won't
argue
that
i
had
merely
asked
the
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
clark,
i
didn't
--
i
don't
quite
remember
your
answer
to
justice
white
when
he
asked
you
if
you
are
arguing
that
section
1971
is
unconstitutional
to
the
extent
that
it
authorizes
a
proceeding
instituted
by
the
attorney
general
against
the
state.
do
you
consider
it's
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no.
no
joining
at
all.
let's
take
the
last
half
of
it.
if
there
is
no
--
if
there
is
no
successor
in
office
after
the
official
has
resigned,
the
proceeding
maybe
instituted
against
the
state.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
can
be
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
there
is
no
individual
against
whom
the
action
can
be
brought
while
he
was
in
the
office,
and
the
proceeding
may
be
instituted
against
the
state,
what
relief
may
be
given
against
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
