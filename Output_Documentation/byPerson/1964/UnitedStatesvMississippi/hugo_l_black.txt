justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
denied
by
this
defendant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
never
--
we
have
to
consider
that
that's
a
fact
in
there
whether
he
denied
it
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
your
time
is
limited
and
i
don't
want
to
take
any
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
might
be
a
very
vital
distinction
as
to
whether
the
court
decides
if
it's
going
on
its
faith
to
avoid
in
this
operation
insofar
as
your
relief
is
concerned.
if
all
the
relief
granted
would
be
and
i
don't
do
this
discriminatorily,
it
would
be
quite
a
different
relief
saying
you
can't
do
it
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
undoubtedly
be
entitled
there
if
it's
going
on
its
face.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
but
the
arguments
are
different.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
could
be
no
argument
against
it.
it
could
be
held
void
on
its
face.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
criminal
punishment
possible
under
this
act
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
1971?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
it
provide?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
there
was
one
that
sounds
familiar
in
the
offense
--
criminal
offense
to
violate
any
of
the
civil
rights
statute,
is
that
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'm
hearing
is
the
one
that
--
is
that
in
that
--
from
the
registrar
and
did
not
keep
the
record
to
the
court
and
then
i'm
guilty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we've
done
it
before,
haven't
we?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
if
your
--
if
that
ground
is
solid,
that
is
a
distinction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
be
the
effect
or
the
remedy
that
could
be
shown
that
the
mississippi
was
--
the
law
said
21,
it
allowed
all
whites
over
18
to
vote
but
allowed
no
negroes
at
that
age?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
effect
would
that
have
on
the
law
as
that
should
be
held
to
be
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
we've
held
that
reference
to
some
laws
and
you
had
to
judge
him
by
how
they
were
administered,
not
by
how
they
were
written
on
the
books
and
let
me
reference
to
the
tax
laws
down
in
tennessee
some
years
ago.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
did
the
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
aside
from
the
effect
of
that
is
that
material
to
the
point
we
have
to
the
dismissal
of
this
case,
the
point
you're
now
arguing
as
to
what
remedies
and
what
can
be
the
remedy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
deciding
precisely
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
as
you
said
in
the
beginning
i
gather
that
one
point
for
a
decision
whether
the
attorney
general
has
a
right
to
file
this
suit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
fifteenth
amendment
has
made
quite
a
change
with
reference
to
voting
in
election?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
does
not
fit
the
qualifications
for
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
does
one
thing
which
cannot
be
disputed
here.
it
gives
the
congress
the
power
to
pass
laws,
to
protect
that
right
if
he
sees
fit
to
do
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
says
there
--
to
pass
laws
appropriately,
to
do
what
the
voters
to
be
done
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
not
the
course
here
because
the
congress
hasn't
passed
a
law
particularly
fixing
the
registration
and
qualification
for
voters.
