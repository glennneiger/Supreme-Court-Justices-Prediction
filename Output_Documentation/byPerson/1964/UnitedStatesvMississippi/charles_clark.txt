mr.
charles
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
think
it's
appropriate
for
me
to
emphasize
that
i
am
not
going
to
stand
before
this
court
and
contend
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
is
not
in
the
constitution
nor
am
i
taking
the
position
with
you
that
the
legal
effect
of
our
motion
to
dismiss
was
not
to
admit
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
although,
there
is
an
answer
on
file,
in
which
these
allegations
offer
the
most
part
to
deny
it.
i
think
that
the
single
issue
that
is
really
worthy
of
this
court's
time
and
attention
in
this
case
is
the
issue
of
the
constitutional
and
statutory
ambit
of
the
attorney
general's
authority
to
have
brought
the
suit
that
was
dismissed.
this,
i
think,
is
the
point
at
issue
that
is
before
this
court
today.
i
think
that
its
resolution
involves
a
rather
complex
relationship
created
by
the
constitution
between
the
central
government
and
the
50
states.
and
i
don't
think
that
you
can
decide
this
case
on
mississippi
facts
and
wind
up
with
a
rule
of
statutory
decision
that
will
fail
to
effect
the
relationships
of
the
central
government
and
each
of
the
other
49
states
besides
mississippi.
i
think
this
is
the
real
importance
of
the
case.
and
i
think
this
is
the
issue
that
the
court
should
consider,
because
i
think
that
--
well,
it's
not
my
opinion,
the
opinions
of
this
court
have
held
throughout
the
history
of
this
court,
that
the
proper
demarcation
between
where
the
central
government
ends
and
where
the
states
begin
is
the
fundamental
of
a
federal
republic.
this
court
is
the
surveyor.
and
i'm
saying
where
you're
going
to
lay
the
line,
i
wish
you
would
bear
with
me
in
my
argument
by
recalling
throughout,
that
the
able
and
the
eloquent
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
is
constantly
before
this
court.
he's
here
in
washington
all
the
time.
he
presents
a
consistent
argument
for
the
extent
of
federal
power.
the
states
who
are
here
ad
hoc
by
different
counsel
and
certainly,
less
able
counsel
to
hand
their
side
of
the
picture
to
the
court
in
bits
and
pieces,
and
not
as
a
consistent
and
uniform
whole.
and,
i
hope
as
i
say
that
the
court
will
bear
with
me
in
my
argument
with
that
thought
in
mind
--
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
mississippi
that
this
suit
could
not
constitutionally
be
instituted
against
the
state.
and
perhaps
it
would
be
wise
on
this
exact
point
to
begin
with
a
negative.
the
state
of
mississippi
is
not
invoking
sovereign
immunity
nor
is
it
invoking
the
constitutional
bar
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
this
is
not
the
concept
of
the
state's
defense
that
this
suit
could
not
be
constitutionally
maintained
against
it.
what
the
state
says
is
that
this
court
did
not
commit
a
violation
of
the
constitution
when
in
eleventh
amendment
cases
it
said
that
the
state
is
separate
from
the
individuals
who
compose
its
government.
and
therefore
when
the
same
constitution
that
contains
the
fifteenth
amendment
bar
against
a
state
commits
a
wrong
through
individuals
that
this
is
not
the
state's
wrong
that
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
has
not
wronged
an
individual
but
rather
an
errant
official
has
wronged
that
individual.
and
the
individual
has
a
right
of
action
against
him
even
though
the
majesty
of
his
office
had
to
be
present
so
that
he
could
accomplish
his
wrong
doing.
if
any
other
theory
is
valid
and
i
with
that
most
difference
just
so
it
will
be
the
most
pointed
analogy
that
i
could
make.
when
evil
man
could
sit
in
a
chair
on
this
court
and
make
the
court
evil
and
that's
not
possible.
the
court
is
something
more
than
the
people
that
sit
in
these
chairs.
this
is
not
possible
for
any
officer
to
do
to
his
office.
he's
the
wrongdoer.
mr.
charles
clark
yes,
your
honor,
for
the
point
of
the
--
of
making
an
accusation
of
wrong
doing.
now,
there
are
cases
when
the
state
is
the
repository
of
title
to
lands
when
the
state
holds
property
that's
involved
in
the
suit
that
it
might
be
a
legal
defendant
but
where
the
accusation
is
a
wrong
has
been
done.
mr.
charles
clark
particularly,
your
honor,
my
mind
really
hasn't
gone
beyond
the
contrast
of
the
case.
this
is
a
criminal
wrong
if
it's
wrong
at
all
particularly
not
a
criminal
wrong
because
as
between
sovereigns,
there
can
be
no
law
of
crime.
mr.
charles
clark
well
sir,
it
goes
further
than
that.
it
goes
of
course
to
the
point
where
if
a
commission
of
a
wrong
involves
a
breach
of
the
constitution.
and
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
is
involved
then
obviously,
the
constitution
gives
a
remedy.
but
my
point
with
you
sir
is
that
in
a
criminal
wrong
and
a
wrong
of
this
type,
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
can't
be
involved,
it's
the
officer.
and
i
think
this
is
1971,
the
basic
jurisdictional
statute
that
the
governor
--
that
the
government
relies
or
the
authorization
statute
is
not
jurisdictional
theory.
this
is
shot
through
with
recognitions
on
behalf
of
congress
that
this
is
the
constitutional
point
because
it
talks
of
actions
of
individuals
when
persons
commit
wrongs
then
it
says,
"any
law
of
the
state
is
to
be
taken
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
unless
right
of
action
goes
beyond
the
law
given
by
the
state.”
mr.
charles
clark
no
sir,
i
don't.
mr.
charles
clark
it
permits
in
my
opinion
sir
and
this
was
a
little
bit
later
in
my
argument
but
i'll
get
to
it
now.
it
permits
the
joinder
of
a
state.
and
the
problem
before
congress
when
this
language
was
put
into
the
enactment
laws.
a
problem
whereby
a
registration
official
had
resigned
and
nobody
would
take
his
place.
mr.
charles
clark
there's
no
claim
in
that
instance
if
your
honor
please
that
the
state
has
done
wrong.
it
is
certainly
a
vehicle
for
writing
discrimination
that
the
constitution
forbids
because
there
is
no
person
against
whom
that
wrong
can
be
right.
and
therefore
it
says,
in
this
instance,
in
the
instance
where
there
is
nobody
there,
the
action
can
be
instituted
against
the
state.
and
it's
a
concept
of
what
they
meant
by
the
word
join
really.
mr.
charles
clark
suits
against
states
where
crimes
are
charged.
because
every
time
--
mr.
charles
clark
yes,
sir.
because
both
have
to
be
entwined
because
the
state
itself
can't
violate
the
constitution
any
more
than
the
united
states
can
violate
the
constitution.
mr.
charles
clark
yes
sir.
well,
it
is
alleged
and
it
must
justice
white,
where
it
is
alleged
that
the
vehicle
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
did
this.
and
this
is
why
i
make
a
distinction
in
--
mr.
charles
clark
well,
sir
--
mr.
charles
clark
in
its
sovereign
capacity
not
its
governmental
capacity
and
the
distinction
would
be
that
the
people
who
constitute
the
government,
can
never
so
absent
themselves
from
the
state
or
from
the
area
by
death
or
by
resignation
or
by
any
other
force
that
they
can
defeat
the
right
to
correct
the
constitutional
wrong.
but
it
was
their
wrong
and
when
you
--
when
the
congress
permits
the
states
to
be
--
the
state
to
be
sued
as
an
action
instituted
against
them
where
a
man
has
done
wrong
and
then
the
left,
it's
not
to
correct
the
sovereignty
is
wrong,
it's
to
correct
the
wrong
of
the
man
that's
no
longer
there.
and
it's
not
a
charge
against
the
state.
in
other
words,
it's
not
a
force
sir
that
could
destroy
the
state
which
is
exactly
what
this
court
--
what
this
case
could
do.
it
could
say,
"you're
no
good
mississippi".
and
that's
not
possible
any
more
so
than
it
would
be
for
mississippi
to
say
to
the
united
states,
you
are
no
good.
because
this
is
a
compact,
this
constitution
is
a
compact,
a
contract,
an
agreement
that
the
united
states
cannot
violate.
and
if
it
does,
it's
wrong.
but
it's
the
wrong
of
its
individual
officers.
so
much
so
that
when
secretary
forrestal
was
sued
in
mine
safety
appliances
versus
forrestal.
this
court
was
careful
to
point
out
that
it
was
not
his
act.
i
mean
it
was
not
the
act
of
the
united
states
that
was
in
--
in
issue.
it
was
the
act
of
an
individual
and
if
he
had
taken
something
from
somebody
because
he
was
an
officer
of
the
united
states,
he
was
the
one
that
was
liable
not
the
united
states.
the
united
states
wasn't
even
in
this
principle
part
of
the
suit
and
sovereign
immunity
didn't
prevent
in
going
forward.
it
was
very
clear
on
that.
and
if
i
might,
while
we're
on
this
question
of
joint.
1971
has
two
different
aspects
and
i
claim
that
the
attorney
general
has
just
turned
them
apparent
thought
before
in
his
effort
to
show
what
cause
constitution.
1971
says
that
where
this
individual
action
has
taken
place,
the
united
states
can
sue
a
registrar
and
it
gives
them
permission
to
jointhe
state.
then
it
points
out,
when
the
official
is
no
longer
present
and
then
it
can
be
instituted
against
the
state.
the
constitutional
conception
of
that
language
is
that
the
congress
solved
the
problem
that
it
had
before
it.
and
that
was
--
first
of
all,
they
had
the
language
written,
if
the
man
is
no
longer
there
it
can
be
instituted
against
the
state.
and
that
is
what
i
just
explained
to
you.
then
the
suggestion
was
made,
"well,
what
if
after
the
institution
of
the
action
or
against
the
individual
registrar
he
then
resigns
or
then
dies
or
he's
no
longer
available
so
that
this
individual
relief
can
be
granted
against
him”.
so
congress
came
back
and
said,
“we'll
permit
you
to
join
the
state.”
and
i
say
that
joining
was
used
in
the
sense
of
it
onto
afterwards,
join
when
it
became
constitutionally
necessary
to
join.
but
here,
the
thrust
of
this
action
is,
the
state
was
wrong
and
that
all
that
occurred
is
they
picked
six
registrars
and
pasted
them
on
to
the
suit,
the
thrust
of
which
is
against
the
state
of
mississippi
and
i
would
say
it's
an
action
instituted
against
the
state
to
which
registrars
at
random
were
joined.
not
an
action
against
the
registrars
where
it
became
necessary
to
join
the
state.
and
at
the
outset
too,
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
it's
my
contention
that
this
in
any
way
enfeebles
1971
or
stops
the
writing
of
constitutional
wrongs
if
registrars
are
available,
if
the
man
who
bring
the
wrong
into
being
or
that
and
then
they
can
be
sued
and
their
actions
corrected
in
suits
against
them
and
it's
not
necessary
to
bring
the
constitutional
issue
of
an
attack
on
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
of
mississippi
into
the
case
at
all.
mr.
charles
clark
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
clark
i
agree
with
you
too
hastily
because
i
did
not
know
that
you
were
going
to
explain
your
thought
in
the
way
that
you
subsequently
did.
the
answer
to
your
exact
question
would
be,
no.
i
would
say
that
the
only
constitutional
concept
of
join
in
the
first
part
of
that
statute
sir
would
be
to
join
him
in
the
existing
action
against
the
registrar
when
and
if
that
registrar
became
unavailable.
this
was
the
problem
opposed
to
congress
and
i
would
say
that
they
did
--
they
did
not
do
anymore
than
to
solve
the
problem
presented
to
them.
mr.
charles
clark
two
different
factual
situations
--
mr.
charles
clark
mr.
chief
justice
but
not
two
different
factual
situations
defined
as
you
have
defined
them
sir.
in
other
words,
as
i
say,
i
think
our
difference
would
be
in
the
meaning
of
the
word
join.
you
were
thinking
of
join
as
now
bringing
an
original
joint
action
against.
and
i'm
thinking
of
the
word
join
is
add
onto
an
existing
lawsuit
where
a
disability
of
the
defendant
has
occurred.
mr.
charles
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
clark
and
stop
there
so
i
think
you
would
have
had
an
entirely
concept
and
the
rest
of
the
statute
could
(voice
overlap).
mr.
charles
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
the
--
mr.
charles
clark
it's
the
concept
of
the
word
join
sir
that
we
have
our
difference
about.
if
your
concept
of
the
word
joined
were
the
--
were
the
one
that
will
finally
be
interpreted
to
stand
and
then
the
balance
--
the
whole
balance
of
that
statute
about
if
he
is
not
there,
if
prior
to
the
institution
that
he
--
of
the
suit
he
has
resigned,
this
wouldn't
mean
a
thing.
it
wouldn't
add
anything
to
what
congress
had
done
and
the
words
of
the
court.
it
would
be
cutting
a
little
hole
in
the
fence
for
little
cats
when
they
already
cut
a
big
hole
for
big
cats.
because
if
they're
going
to
give
a
joint
right
of
action
against
the
state,
why
do
they
even
have
to
bother
to
provide
that
there
may
be
some
other
kind
of
action
on
the
happening
of
different
circumstances.
mr.
charles
clark
yes.
mr.
charles
clark
i
wish
we
could
--
i
wish
i
had
--
i
could
communicate
but
there's
a
difference
between
us
and
--
mr.
charles
clark
this
might
be
an
appropriate
time
also,
if
the
court
please,
to
discuss
word
deem.of
course
this
--
this
has
a
completely
different
legal
significance
than
the
one
we've
been
talking
about.
in
the
income
tax
field,
the
government,
particularly
--
excuse
me,
not
income
tax
but
the
field
of
taxation
and
the
precise
area
of
estate
taxation.
they
were
going
to
deem
any
gift
made
within
three
years
of
death
to
be
in
contemplation
of
death.
and
that
deem
meaning,
has
a
conclusive
presumption
was
stricken
down
by
this
court
in
hannah
versus
donald
(ph).
and
one
point
also
in
that
case
was
that
just
because
the
government
would
find
it
more
expedient
to
have
this
deemed
into
being
was
no
constitutional
reason
to
create
an
irrebuttable
presumption.
so
this
business
of
deeming
the
action
of
an
officer
of
which
is
wrong,
which
cannot
become
the
action
of
the
state,
to
be
the
action
of
the
state
is
an
illogical
presumption,
an
irrational
presumption
and
one
is
made
conclusive
by
the
operation
of
the
statute
and
one
is
clearly
impermissible
under
the
rules
of
other
cases
in
this
court.
mr.
charles
clark
yes,
sir.
and
this,
this
is
--
mr.
justice
goldberg,
this
is
the
real
difference.
state
action
is
covered
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
state
action
is
covered
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
state
action
is
covered
by
the
fifteenth
amendment.
but
how
can
you
say
that
this
court
chose
to
give
a
different
meaning
to
the
eleventh
amendment
state
action
than
it
chose
to
give
to
the
fourteenth
or
fifteenth
without
saying
that
this
court
was
just
playing
with
the
constitution.
as
the
solicitor
general
said,
state
in
his
conception
means
the
same
thing
throughout
the
constitution.
state
means
in
the
fifteenth
amendment
what
it
meant
in
the
eleventh
amendment.
and
under
the
eleventh
amendment
cases,
this
court
holds,
an
individual
can
commit
state
action.
but
that
action
is
not
the
act
of
the
state
and
there's
more
in
this
than
just
a
play
on
words.
this
is
a
deep
fundamental
constitutional
principle.
because
if
the
united
states
can
hold
a
state
wrong,
its
sovereignty
wrong,
then
it
can
punish
that
state,
it
can
punish
the
sovereignty
of
that
state.
and
it
has
within
its
power,
the
power
to
destroy
the
union
and
this
was
not
given
by
the
constitution.
this
was
something
that
they're
--
the
frame
of
the
constitution
by
and
large
granted.
although
at
that
time,
they
thought
that
it
was
the
states
that
were
going
to
wind
up
dominant
in
our
federal
system.
alright,
at
this
point
on
the
question
of
state
sovereignty,
let
me
read
to
you
from
a
brief
filed
earlier
in
the
same
case
by
the
government
to
show
the
concept
of
the
lawsuit
insofar
as
they
are
concerned.
the
ultimate
sovereign,
the
united
states
of
america,
in
the
name
and
through
its
officials,
attacks
the
conduct
of
a
lesser
political
entity,
the
state
of
mississippi,
which
is
sovereign
only
to
its
subjects
and
coequals,
this
is
the
position
of
the
government
in
this
lawsuit
that
the
united
states,
as
a
central
government,
looks
down
on
its
lesser
political
entities,
the
sovereign
states.
this
court
in
farrington
versus
tennessee
said,
“every
state
has
a
sphereof
action
where
the
authority
of
the
national
government
may
not
intrude,”
within
that
domain
the
state
is
as
if
the
union
were
not.
and
what
i
ask
this
court
to
do
is
to
survey
where
that
line
comes,
this
is
the
issue.where
it
is
the
states
domain?
mr.
charles
clark
no
sir.
mr.
charles
clark
because
the
operation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
has
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
self-executed
when
it
came
into
effect,
there
were
a
number
of
states
that
had
provisions
in
their
franchise
laws,
every
white
male
citizen
that
has
certain
qualifications
is
entitled
to
vote
and
this
court
has
held
it
on
the
day
that
that
amendment
came
into
effect,
white
disappeared.
the
gwynn
case
that
the
solicitor
cited
has
--
i
won't
take
time
to
read
you
the
quotation,
you
know
it
better
than
i
do,
has
exactly
that
meaning
and
when
the
nineteenth
came
in
to
being
--
the
nineteenth
amendment
came
into
being,
male
disappeared.
this
--
but,
let's
suppose
or
even
further.
let's
suppose
that
the
registrar
said,
“i
never
heard
of
any
fifteenth
amendment.
the
law
of
my
state
says
white
people
only
and
that's
what
i'm
going
to
apply.”
who's
wrong
is
that
when
i
colored
citizen
otherwise
qualified
under
the
state
laws
comes
up
and
presents
themselves
and
the
registrar
says,
“that's
my
law,
you
can't
vote”?
who
committed
the
wrong?
did
the
sovereign
state
commit
the
wrong
or
the
man
who
occupies
the
office
of
the
registrar
commit
the
wrong?
this
is
the
--
this
is
the
distinction
that
i
would
make
to
you
sir
about
state
action.
he
committed
state
action
because
he
was
the
official
who
had
the
authority
to
register
or
not
register
but
not
the
state.
mr.
charles
clark
no,
sir.
you
can't
bind
the
state
to
a
criminal
act
by
being
a
member
of
the
legislative
branch
of
government
as
opposed
to
being
a
member
of
the
executive
nor
of
the
judicial.
under
the
concept
that
i've
seen
mr.
justice
goldberg
is
necessarily
inherent
in
the
constitution.
mr.
charles
clark
the
state
cannot
do
that.
the
officers
of
the
state
did
it.
somebody,
i
mean
some
governor
or
some
captain
or
commander
of
the
military,
made
that
decision.
the
state
of
mississippi
doesn't
attack
the
united
states
any
more
than
the
united
states
attacks
a
state.
the
government
of
the
states
can
be
wrong
just
exactly
like
a
false
preacher
can
be
wrong
or
a
false
judge
can
be
wrong.
but
his
office
can't
be
wrong.
mr.
charles
clark
excuse
me.
we'd
have
to
change
state
action
because
i
would
say
state
action
is
obviously
something
that
subject
to
correction
because
state
action
is
what
the
officers
do.
but
the
state
is
indivisible.
i
mean,
the
state
is
--
well,
i
don't
know
that
the
words
that
have
been
used
don't
really
mean
too
much,
ideal,
intangible,
invisible,
immutable.
it
is
there
as
a
constitutional
concept
as
a
repository
of
sovereignty.
as
something
that
will
continue
despite
the
death
of
models,
despite
their
wrongful
action
and
maybe
there
is
no
time,
at
least
in
all
candid,
nothing
has
occurred
to
my
mind
of
your
question
to
me
now
of
an
action
in
which
there
was
a
state,
asserting
its
sovereignty
but
subject
to
suit
other
than
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
clark
yes.
mr.
charles
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
clark
that's
right.
and
then
when
--
and
then
in
the
suits
where
a
man
came
along
and
said,
joe
smith,
the
registrar
used
a
fourteenth
amendment
example
if
that's
what's
on
your
mind.
joe
smith
denied
him
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
he
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
then
the
defense
is
made
--
this
is
--
mr.
charles
clark
this
is
not
the
state,
sir.
mr.
charles
clark
yes,
sir
because
they
say
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
what
this
is,
is
state
action;
just
like
the
eleventh
amendment
says
the
same
thing.
you
can't
come
along
and
say,
you
can't
sue
joe
smith
if
he
deprived
you
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
because
this
in
effect
is
a
suit
against
his
state.
and
they
say
that's
not
what
the
eleventh
amendment
means
and
that's
not
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
means.
those
amendments
are
addressed
to
state
actions,
state
wrong
because
a
state
can't
be
wrong.
this
is
a
thrust
of
ex
parte
virginia,
poindexter
versus
greenhow
and
a
long
line
of
cases
that
have
been
consistently
held
that
way.
that
state
in
the
sense
of
the
constitution
of
the
prohibitions
of
the
constitution
can't
mean
the
sovereignty.
it
must
the
mean
the
man
who
compose
its
government
because
they
are
the
ones
who
can
commit
wrong.
they
are
the
ones
who
can
commit
state
actions.
mr.
charles
clark
no,
sir.
because
those
torts
are
the
actions
of
individuals
just
as
in
the
forrestal
case,
they
said
they
would
permit
the
suit
without
the
united
states
even
being
there.
mr.
charles
clark
but
the
thing
that
is
being
corrected
is
individual
action.
it
can't
constitutionally
be
otherwise.
mr.
charles
clark
to
the
extent
that
they
--
that
the
state,
qua
state
is
said
to
be
acting
unconstitutionally
or
wrongfully.
it
can't
be
squared
with
the
constitution.
mr.
charles
clark
i
do
not
know
of
it,
sir.
i
cannot
answer
your
question.
mr.
charles
clark
thank
you
sir.
i
accept
that.
i
don't
have
another
answer
for
it
at
this
moment.
of
course,
i
think
that
this
position
is
consistent
with
2281
which
was
a
statute
under
which
the
court
was
convened
to
a
three-judge
statute
because
this
statute
says
in
terms
that
it
contemplates
an
action
against
the
enforcer
and
it
requires
that
notice
be
sent
to
the
state.
well,
obviously,
if
it
contemplated
the
state
being
made
a
party,
it
wouldn't
require
a
notice
to
the
governor
or
to
its
attorney
general.
this
statute,
2281,
which
is
as
much
a
foundation
of
this
action
as
any
other
statute,
mentioning
the
government's
jurisdictional
statement
not
discussed
in
their
brief.
here's
a
statute
that
is
necessary
to
support
the
action
of
this
court
as
convened.
mr.
charles
clark
19
--
mr.
charles
clark
no
sir.
you
have
to
go
into
the
criminal
code.
i
believe
it's
title
xviii,
section
242,
mr.
justice
black
which
we
put
to
in
our
brief
at
one
point
or
another
so
i
don't
know
whether
i
can
pick
it
up
for
you
right
now.
mr.
charles
clark
it
provides
that
anyone
who
deprives
another
with
his
constitutional
rights
is
guilty
of
the
crime.
mr.
charles
clark
i
don't
--
i'm
not
able
to
answer
your
question
sir.
but
there
is
one
that
whoever
on
the
color
of
law
deprives
another
of
his
rights
is
guilty
of
--
is
guilty.
this
is
the
whole
civil
rights
law,
nothing
in
the
recent
enactments.
but,
this
was
a
--
mr.
charles
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
clark
yes
sir.
this
is
involved
in
this
lawsuit
because
this
is
the
statute
that
the
government
asked
the
court
to
take
up
and
strike
down
now
and
we
believe
it's
wrong
because
it's
not
a
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause.
and
this
is
a
point
--
this
is
a
time
when
--
if
ever
unequal
sovereignty
does
exist,
it
exists
only
at
that
point
where
there
is
an
interference
with
the
operation
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
but
of
course,
what's
--
what
does
the
whole
thrust
of
this
suit
here
is,
that
individuals
have
been
wrong.
and,
the
united
states
may
more
efficiently
protect
that
wrong
by
bringing
suit
to
correct
those
wrongs
against
individuals.
and
that
the
thrust
of
my
argument
as
to
the
state
is
that
--
that
there
are
individuals
on
both
sides
of
the
suit
--
of
this
suit
and
that
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states
should
not
attack
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
mr.
charles
clark
there
are
some
--
several
of
them
so
i
hope
i'm
familiar
with
--
mr.
charles
clark
is
this
the
tort
suit?
mr.
charles
clark
the
thrust
of
what
i'm
saying
here
so
would
be
that
the
point
that
i
make
pass
sub
silentio
in
the
court's
opinion
there
that
it
didn't
receive
the
necessary
attention,
number
one.
number
two,
that
where
a
property
right
is
involved,
that
the
conflict
is
permissible
because
it
does
not
carry
with
it
a
wrongdoing,
a
criminal
action
on
the
part
of
the
sovereign.
mr.
charles
clark
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
clark
for
property
--
it
was
a
property
action,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
clark
yes
sir.
well,
i
mean
you're
talking
about
now
whether
or
not
there's
inherent
authority
--
mr.
charles
clark
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
clark
under
inherent
authority
as
opposed
to
statute.
mr.
charles
clark
it
would
have
to
be
on
the
property
aspect.
it
was
not
an
attack
on
the
sovereign
as
a
wrongdoer.
it
was
an
attack
on
the
sovereign
over
who
had
title
to
their
property.
the
only
action
of
the
sovereign
would
have
been
that
it
held
the
title
if
the
suit
was
well
taken.
mr.
charles
clark
yes.
mr.
charles
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
if
your
conception
of
join
under
that
statute
--
mr.
charles
clark
no,
sir.
it's
not
my
claim
that
that
portion
of
1971
is
unconstitutional.
in
fact,
i'm
not
contending
that
any
part
of
1971
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
charles
clark
yes
sir,
because
mr.
chief
justice,
the
action
asserted
is
not
an
action
that
says
the
state
was
wrong.
the
state
is
only
brought
in
because
it
is
an
essential
vehicle
to
the
granting
of
relief
from
a
constitutional
wrong.
the
agent
of
the
state
who
was
wrong
and
who
was
accused
of
being
wrong,
it's
just
not
there.
he's
dead
or
he
has
resigned
and
it's
not
the
wrong
won't
stand
unrighted
because
an
agent
is
not
present.
the
state
there
is
really
not
a
wrongdoer,
but
simply
a
defendant
against
whom
relief
can
be
granted.
mr.
charles
clark
to
require
that
the
successors
of
that
officer
right
the
wrong
that
was
done
to
the
individual
person
who
applied
for
registration,
who
was
otherwise
qualified
under
the
state
law,
and
was
denied
because
of
race
or
color.
in
other
words,
the
state
can
be
required
in
that
suit
to
provide
an
agent
or
servant
to
accomplish
the
registration
but
not
because
the
state
was
wrong,
which
is
a
thrust
of
this
action,
not
because
it's
a
lesser
sovereign,
but
because
a
constitutional
wrong
has
been
done
that
needs
to
be
right.
mr.
charles
clark
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
clark
as
far
as
the
sovereign
state
was
involved
in
that
suit
and
i
don't
--
i‘m
not
familiar
with
the
case,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
but
--
mr.
charles
clark
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
clark
yes.
the
only
distinction
that
readily
occurs
to
me
is
that
it
was
a
--
it
was
in
its
proprietary
capacity
as
opposed
to
its
governmental
function.
that's
the
distinction
that
i
would
--
would
tell
you
at
this
time.
so,
other
than
the
fact
that
what
i'm
saying
is
that
it
cannot
be
squared
with
the
constitution.
the
opposite
of
the
view
that
you
can
--
that
you
can
attack
a
state,
the
view
that
you
can
attack
a
state
in
its
sovereign
capacity
gives
whoever
can
attack
it
the
power
to
destroy
it.
in
fact,
you
really
vest
that
power
with
the
individual
officer
because
he
can
say,
“well,
i'm
going
to
go
out
and
do
wrong
and
drag
my
state
down”.
and
he
can't
do
it.
i've
taken
so
much
of
my
time.
i
would
say
this
just
in
closing
the
point
of
the
state.
the
state
is
not
material
to
the
granting
of
relief
in
this
cause
if
the
court
should
reverse
the
lower
court
and
hold
relief
that
the
trial
should
have
taken
place
if
every
allegation
the
complaint
was
proved.
you've
got
to
get
the
individuals
who
committed
the
wrong
enjoined.
and,
the
fact
that
you've
aided
the
state
from
the
top
it
does
nothing
with
regard
to
effective
relief.
on
the
u.s.
versus
atkins,
a
case
that
the
united
states
did
not
appeal
from
the
fifth
circuit
which
res
judicata
as
to
the
point
in
that
case.
mr.
charles
clark
mr.
justice
white,
you're
precisely
right
sir.
it
is
certainly
the
most
expedient
and
efficient
remedy.
the
question
that
i
make
to
you
sir
is
does
it
cut
across
the
constitution
to
get
to
that
efficiency.
mr.
charles
clark
the
point
--
well,
let
me
explain
in
this
instance.
the
point
where
we
would
depart
is
that
--
i
don't
agree
with
the
solicitor's
answer
to
a
question
that
you
posed
to
him
before
the
lunch
recess,
that
this
action
without
the
state,
without
some
joinder
device
that
this
action
could
be
maintained
against
different
registrars.
it
is
not
a
joint
in
several
actions.
if
joe
smith
in
bolova
county
says
to
a
qualified
negro
citizen,
you
can't
register
in
bolova
county
because
i
don't
like
negro
citizens.
and
if
pete
greene
in
george
county
says,
anybody
that
complies
with
the
laws
of
the
state
of
mississippi
can
register
in
my
county,
and
he
does
not
discriminate,
how
can
you
enjoin
the
greene
county
registrar
because
of
something
that
bolova
county
registrar
did
particularly
when
these
registrars
don't
have
the
right
to
register
out
of
the
area.
they
don't
just
travel
over
the
state
registering
people.
they
are
limited
and
confined
to
the
scope
of
a
single
county.
and
everybody
in
that
county
can
apply
only
to
that
registrar
to
become
registered.
but
this
--
mr.
charles
clark
he
is
required
--
this
is
another
thing
that
we
differ
with
the
government
on
an
interpretation
to
mississippi
law.
the
law
says
that
the
circuit
clerk
who
is
an
elected
official
of
each
county
elected
for
a
four-year
term
shall
be
the
registrar
of
voters
of
that
county
unless
he
is
shown
to
be
an
improper
person
and
never
in
the
history
of
a
state
have
i
known,
anyone
other
than
a
circuit
clerk
to
be
appointed
the
registrars
just
for
function.
he
just
inherits
it
with
his
elected
officers
in
the
circuit
court.
mr.
charles
clark
yes.
there
was
a
question
with
regard
to
registration
--
permanency
of
registration.
it
is
permanent
in
mississippi
except
that
the
voter
supervisors
of
every
county,
when
they
deem
necessary
can
call
for
a
re-registration.
everybody
has
to
start
over
again.
mr.
charles
clark
there
had
been
re-registrations.
i
can't
--
they
haven't
been
frequent.
but
there
have
been
counties
of
mississippi
that
availed
re-registrations.
mr.
charles
clark
you
say
absolute
discretion
sir,
i
don't
--
i
think
that
they
have
to
find
the
--
mr.
charles
clark
some
reason
for
it.
i
don't
know.
you
say
they
can
so,
general?
they
can
order
it
to
the
attorney
general
sir,
any
time.
mr.
charles
clark
yes,
only
they
--
the
board
of
supervisors
functions
only
for
the
county.
mr.
charles
clark
82.
i
don't
know
now.
i've
wasted
so
much
time
that
i
don't
know
which
of
the
remaining
points
that
would
be
best
to
emphasize.
but
let
me
just
say
that
since
the
attorney
general
made
a
direct
point
of
yick
wo
versus
hopkins.
and,
because
this
is
the
interpretation
of
this
case
has
been
such
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
so
many
course.
i
guess
it's
been
cited
as
often
as
any
case
in
the
books.
let
me
just
read
to
you
if
i
may,
what
i
consider
the
crux
of
the
case
which
i
think
clearly
demonstrates
that
the
actions
of
the
officer
did
not
invalidate
the
statute.
i
don't
agree
that
the
municipal
ordinance
involved
in
yick
wo
versus
hopkins
was
held
unconstitutional.
i
think
that
it
was
not.
the
court
never
reached
that
question.
in
the
beginning,
mr.
justice
matthews
said,
“our
jurisdiction
is
limited
to
the
question
whether
the
plaintiff
in
error
has
been
denied
a
right
in
violation
of
the
constitution
laws
or
treatises
in
the
united
states.
yick
wo
was
in
jail.
he
wanted
to
get
out
of
jail.
he
would
have
been
wrongfully
imprisoned
if
a
bad
law
put
him
there
on
the
proper
administration
just
like
he
would
have
been
wrongfully
imprisoned
if
bad
administration
of
a
good
law
put
him
there.
so,
either
one
of
the
two
facets
would
have
been
sufficient
to
release
yick
wo
from
jail.
in
fact,
the
court
in
defining
what
was
prayed
for
said,
is
contained
on
the
part
of
the
petitioners
that
the
ordinance
for
violation
of
which
they
are
severally
sentenced
to
imprisonment
or
void
on
their
face
as
being
within
the
prohibition
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
in
the
alternative,
the
second
ground
was
they
are
void
by
reason
of
the
administration.
then
the
holding
of
the
court
nowhere
in
that
case
that
you
find
this
court
say,
“that
statute
was
unconstitutional.”
that
sentence
is
nowhere
in
the
case,
nowhere
in
the
opinion,
and
certainly,
they
would
not
have
struck
--
bound
an
ordinance
without
at
least
that
perfunctory
pronouncements,
rather
they
said,
“though
the
law
itself
be
fair
on
its
face
and
impartial
and
applies,
yet
if
it's
applied
and
administered
with
an
uneven
hand
so
that
it
unjustly
discriminates
--
unconstitutionally
discriminates.”
then
yick
wo
is
wrongfully
in
jail
and
he's
entitled
to
be
released.
and
they
said
this
is
the
class
of
case
that
we
are
dealing
with
here,
this
class
of
wrongful
administration.
yick
wo
was
not
a
case
holding
that
any
officer
can
destroy
a
statute
by
choosing
to
violate
instead
of
obey
it.
the
attorney
general
--
the
solicitor
general
claims
that
he
is
seeking
preventive
relief.
our
claim
in
that
regard
is
that
he
tells
you
only
part
of
the
story
because
with
his
claim,
entwined
inseparably
in
his
claim
which
says
declare
this
statutes
void
and
enjoin
their
application,
is
the
essential
and
necessary
claim
of
“create
for
me,”
new
franchise
laws
for
the
state
of
mississippi
because
the
ones
existing
were
applied
with
a
bad
purpose.
and
they've
now
been
now
been
made
bad
on
the
yick
wo
versus
hopkins.
we
disagree
with
his
application
of
yick
wo.
but
for
this
example,
take
the
qualification
now
required
by
mississippi
that
a
voter
be
21
years
of
age.
would
this
court
say
that
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
mississippi
could
not
pass
a
law
stating
that
from
this
day
forward,
we
believe
that
voters
in
mississippi
ought
to
be
25?
could
they
pass
a
law
that
said
we
believe
from
this
day
forward,
they
ought
to
be
18?
if
that
law
was
passed,
that
one
single
change
in
the
constitution
and
laws,
would
it
be
bad,
would
it
be
within
this
domain
that
belongs
exclusively
to
the
state?
now,
let
me
add
the
solicitor
general's
gloss
and
let's
say
that
he
comes
up
after
the
legislature
has
acted
to
change
the
age
of
registration
from
21
to
25.
he
says,
“look,
i
have
found
some
statistics
from
the
bureau
of
census
that
say
that
the
number
of
colored
citizens
between
21
and
25
that
lived
in
the
state
of
mississippi
is
less
than
the
number
of
white
citizens
between
21
and
25
that
live
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
10%?50%?
would
the
law
be
wrong
then?
could
mississippi
still
change
the
age
of
its
electors
from
21
to
25?
if
statistics
showed
that
it
would
have
a
discriminatory
application
if
everybody
in
one
racial
group
and
the
other
racial
group
applied?
would
the
law
be
wrong
for
that
reason?
would
the
attorney
general
on
the
converse
have
a
right
to
come
into
mississippi
and
say,
“your
law
has
always
been
age
21
but
i
want
the
laws
relating
to
voting
in
mississippi
stricken
down
because
of
acts
of
past
racial
discrimination
by
administrative
officials?”
and
i
not
only
want
the
court
to
strike
out
those
laws,
i
want
you
now
to
lower
the
age
to
18
because
i
find
again
from
a
survey
that
there
are
more
colored
people
between
21
and
18.
so
this
would
be
a
helpful
thing.
so
while
are
we
are
remaking
mississippi's
election
laws,
let's
remake
them
to
18
because
this
would
help
us
along.
mr.
charles
clark
until
they
were
21.
mr.
charles
clark
absolutely
none,
mr.
justice
black,
in
my
conception
because
there
are
again,
you
would
be
allowing
a
man
charged
with
the
correct
use
of
a
statute
to
violate
the
statute
and
kill
it,
to
kill
it
by
his
wrongful
act.
mr.
charles
clark
i
wasn't
--
mr.
charles
clark
--
familiar
with
that
case.
i
was
familiar
with
the
browning
--
the
railroad
company
versus
browning
case
that
the
solicitor
general
cited
which
is
a
completely
different
case.
it
doesn't,
though,
in
my
opinion
is
not
cited
and
the
excerpt
from
that
case
is
not
sufficiently
broad
to
show
the
court
what
actually
happened.
in
the
railroad
case,
they
did
used
the
words
that
the
administrative
cause
to
put
on
the
laws,
remade
the
laws
but
that's
not
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
in
his
opinion.
he
pointed
out
that
the
state
of
tennessee
had
a
right
to
separately
assist
railroad
property
at
one
rate
of
taxation
from
the
rate
of
taxation
applied
to
the
rate
of
assessment,
applied
to
other
property
of
different
kind.
in
other
words,
the
classification
of
railroads
and
public
utilities
was
a
permissible
classification.
he
said,
because
they
could
have
done
that
in
their
statutory
laws
but
did
not.
we're
going
to
hold
that
they
had
a
right
to
do
it
administratively.
mr.
charles
clark
no,
sir.
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
concede
that
this
court
is
null
now
at
this
time
or
concerned
with
the
question
of
remedy.
you
know,
this
case
was
reversed
in
an
order
of
argument
with
the
louisiana
case.
it
is
at
a
different
stage
in
this
proceeding.
this
case
has
been
simply
dismissed
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
the
merits
of
the
issues
before
the
court
have
never
--
they
have
never
been
presented
to
a
lower
court.
there's
nothing
here
to
review
with
regard
to
a
ruling
on
the
merits.
i
think
that
the
ruling
of
this
court
is
concerned
with
whether
or
not
you're
going
to
reverse
the
lower
court
or
affirm
the
lower
court
in
its
--
in
this
granting
of
the
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
charles
clark
on
deciding
whether
or
not
the
attorney
general
in
this
case
has
taken
a
constitutional
shortcut,
thus,
he
lacked
the
power.
and
with
regard
to
inherent
power,
i
might
say
that
if
you
hold
that
the
attorney
general
has
inherent
power
to
attack
voting
laws,
then
he
certainly
did
waste
a
lot
of
time
in
not
bringing
reynolds
versus
sims
to
the
court's
attention
because
this
was
a
violation
of
the
constitution
there.
and
just
as
much
within
his
inherent
power
as
it
would
have
been
to
bringing
wesberry
versus
sanders
and
if
he's
got
an
inherent
power
to
sue
for
violation
of
fourteenth
amendment
rights,
it
would
change
some
of
the
decisional
law
of
this
court.
mr.
charles
clark
yes,
precisely.
and
we've
outlined
in
our
brief
and
i've
been
too
long
in
my
argument
and
i
apologize
to
the
court
for
not
making
a
more
consistent
argument.
but
we
have
outlined
in
our
briefs,
the
precise
reasons
why
each
of
the
different
defendants
that
he
brought
suit
against
were
improperly
sued
by
the
attorney
general.
one
other
point
with
regard
to
--
with
regard
to
constitutional
adjudications,
one
of
the
basic
reasons
that
we
claim
that
the
attorney
general
would
not
have
the
right
to
attack
a
state
law
for
constitutional
invalidity
would
be
the
reason
that
this
court
relied
on
in
u.s.
versus
raines
to
prohibit
the
attack
on
a
united
states
statute
there,
which
was
that
it
would
bring
up
an
abstract
question
of
constitutional
adjudication.
it's
not
a
question
as
in
the
last
case
where
an
applicant
to
vote
came
in
to
the
court
and
said,
“i
am
otherwise
qualified
and
here
are
my
qualifications.
i
applied
to
be
registered
to
vote
and
the
registrar
denied
me
on
the
grounds
of
my
race
and
color.
he
would
have
registered
me
if
i
had
been
of
another
race
or
color.”
this
is
a
concrete
specific
example
on
which
constitutionality
of
legislation
has
historically
been
adjudged.
and
the
united
states
here
is
saying,
“we
don't
like
this
law.
they've
been
applied
in
a
number
of
instances
and
yet
the
solicitor
says
to
you
why
if
we
have
to
bring
individual
suits,
it'll
be
difficult
to
prove
our
case”.
and
he
says,
on
the
other
hand
that
he
wants
you
to
take
judicial
notice
of
sufficient
facts
to
hold
these
laws
unconstitutional.it
presents
an
abstract
question
of
adjudication
of
constitutionality
and
not
a
specific
question
of
adjudication.
and
it
gets
back
to
one
fundamental
rule,
a
rule
which
i
believe
is
widely
recognized
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
that
is
that
when
you
are
confronted
with
the
question
of
where
a
statute
is
or
is
not
unconstitutional,
that
issue
is
not
properly
resolved
by
a
judge
saying,
“would
i
have
voted
for
that
if
i've
been
in
the
legislature?
that's
not
a
good
act.
i
don't
like
it”.
the
question
is,
is
there
any
conceivable
set
of
facts
that
this
court
believes
are
reasonable
in
which
the
constitutional
validity
of
this
law
may
be
upheld.
that's
the
proper
test.
we
think
that
the
attorney
general's
argument
is
exactly
an
argument
seeking
to
hold
the
statutes
of
mississippi
unconstitutional
and
intertwined
with
that,
fix
his
new
qualifications
that
he
outlines
in
his
complaint
which
don't
comply
with
mississippi's
constitution
of
1890,
which
don't
comply
with
the
predecessor
constitution
of
1869,
neither
one
would
bet
these
are
new
sets
of
qualifications
conceived
by
the
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
mississippi.
we
say
that
no
massive
assault
for
the
time
made
here
was
permissible.
just
one
remark
and
i'm
through.
suppose
an
article
had
been
introduced
into
the
constitution,
empowering
the
united
states
to
regulate
the
elections
for
particular
states
would
any
man
have
hesitated
to
condemn
it,
both
as
an
unwarrantable
transposition
of
power
and
as
a
premeditated
engine
for
the
destruction
of
state
governments.
those
are
words
of
alexander
hamilton,
the
man
who
proposed
that
our
constitution
be
so
framed
that
the
national
government
would
have
the
power
to
appoint
the
chief
executive
of
every
state
who
would
be
appointed
during
this
behavior
and
would
have
to
absolute
right
of
veto
and
yet
he
himself
was
unwilling
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
to
approve
any
such
far
reaching
effect
as
this
lawsuit
would
have
us
--
would
have
the
court
adjudicate
to
be
proper.
and
that
part
that
i
read
is
--
mr.
charles
clark
to
prohibitions
mr.
justice
black,
against
actions
with
regard
to
voting
to
saying,
“no,
you
cannot”,
no
state
shall,
it
does
not
fix
qualifications
for
voters
and
this
is
the
thrust
of
this
case.
in
other
words
i
am
saying
to
you
--
mr.
charles
clark
no.
mr.
charles
clark
it
gives
congress
the
power
to
enforce
the
articles.
and
this
is
what
congress
exercised
in
1971
and
we
claim
the
government's
position
in
this
case
is
entirely
without
support
on
the
1971
because
congress
was
seeking
to
enforce
a
prohibition,
was
seeking
to
enforce
a
don't,
and
not
a
do.
mr.
charles
clark
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
clark
yes,
and
we
would
say
also
that
this
is
not
--
this
another
reason
why
inherent
power
can't
come
into
play
because
here
the
constitution
has
expressly
said,
congress
shall
have
the
power
to
enforce
this
article
and
the
congress
has
acted
and
has
enforced
it
and
has
enforced
by
enacting
1971.
and
their
end
must
be
found,
the
repository
or
power
to
bring
the
suit.
thank
you
sir.
