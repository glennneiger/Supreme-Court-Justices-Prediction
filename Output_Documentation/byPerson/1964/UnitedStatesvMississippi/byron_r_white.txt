what
page?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
solicitor
general,
we
have
the
court
said
about
the
case
about
yick
wo
that
perhaps
the
case
was
held
unconstitutional
on
its
face
that
was
applied
in
such
a
way
by
the
guaranteed
equal
protection
clause.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
mr.
solicitor
general
that
you
couldn't
have
sued
the
state
alone
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
i
mean
we
could.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
my
question.
now,
under
1971,
i
take
it
that
even
if
you
hadn't
enjoined
the
state
here,
you
think
you
could
have
maintained
this
suit
against
all
these
registrars
in
this
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
all
the
state
--
and
all
the
other
officials
in
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that
has
been
your
problem
or
anything
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
joining
the
state,
that
argument
remained
the
same
whether
you
join
the
state
or
you
don't,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
under
1971,
the
--
i
take
it,
the
united
states
could
not
sue
the
state
of
mississippi
and
its
registrars
to
--
to
declare
the
statute
void
on
its
face
unrelated
to
its
applicants.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
there's
a
threat
of
the
enforcement?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
clark,
i
think
your
point
would
hold
that
your
argument
would
be
made
against
anyone
suing
the
state
whether
it
was
the
united
states
suing
the
state
or
anyone
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
civil
or
any
other
--
any
kind
of
a
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
to
the
extent
that
there
are
any
statutes
or
on
the
books
now
which
purport
to
give
federal
courts
jurisdiction
of
suits
against
states.
those
statute
are
to
that
extent
unconstitutional
to
the
extent
that
they
purport
to
allow
a
state
as
the
state
could
be
sued
except
in
that
limited
category,
you
might
say
that
were
like
entitled
to
the
property
and
things
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
see
why
your
contention
doesn't
have
then
--
have
to
carry
the
saying
that
1971
is
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
permits
--
it
permits
joinder
of
the
state
and
at
least
of
its
circumstances
as
a
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
don't
see
how
that
changes
the
--
the
character
or
the
thrust
of
your
argument
about
the
ability
to
make
the
state
a
party
in
a
suit
like
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
say
that
the
constitutional
provisions
purporting
to
extend
the
judicial
power
to
suit
against
states
and
certain
--
certain
circumstance
have
to
have
these
blocks
to
put
on
it.
but
that
this
excludes,
necessarily
excludes
suits
against
states
of
this
type.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
violations
of
constitutional
--
of
the
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
no
state
can
constitutionally
be
sued
where
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
right
is
alleged.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
just
involved
in
suing
the
state
isn't
it,
when
you
say
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
the
state
of
mississippi
and
alleged
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
right?
you
say
the
state
as
it
stated
that
its
governmental
or
sovereign
capacity
can't
commit
a
wrong
like
that
and
it
can't
be
sued.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
--
except
for
the
owner's
gift
of
property
when
--
when
do
you
think
the
state
ever
takes
any
action
in
your
defense?
when
the
--
i
guess
you
just
never
can
see
a
state
acting.
you
can
never
discover
any
state
action
except
in
ownership
of
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
forbids
a
state
from
doing
something
--
from
discriminating
for
example.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
uses
the
word
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
say
state
action.
it
doesn't
say
state
officials
but
simply
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
the
fourteenth
amendment
then
you
wouldn't
have
enough
cause
of
action
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
case
that
you've
made
parties
on
what
mr.
justice
goldberg
said
and
they
pay.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
maintain
a
--
you
maintain
an
action
against
10
registrars
and
they
are
enjoined,
10
other
registrars
may
not
be
enjoined,
but
if
you
entered
an
injunction
against
the
state
of
mississippi
and
its
agents
and
employees,
i
would
suppose
that
all
the
registrars,
at
least
those
who
know
about
the
injunction
and
they're
given
the
--
and
their
due
process
rights
aren't
violated
would
be
bound
just
like
the
injunction
in
louisiana
case
that
forbids
louisiana
in
its
agents
and
employees
from
doing
so
forth.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
suggested
that
this
doesn't
going
to
make
any
difference
in
terms
of
remedy.
i'm
suggesting
that
it
does
make
a
difference.
i'm
not
saying
you're
right
but
it's
--
