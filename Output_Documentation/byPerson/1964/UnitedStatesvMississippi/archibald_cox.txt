mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
brought
by
the
united
states
to
enjoin
mississippi
officials
from
continuing
to
enforce
certain
provisions
in
the
mississippi
constitutions
and
statutes
which
in
their
operation
deprive
otherwise
qualified
negro
citizens
of
the
opportunity
to
vote
without
distinction
of
race
or
color.
a
three-judge
district
court
held
by
a
divided
vote
that
the
complaint
did
not
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted
against
any
of
the
defendants.
its
decision
was
based
partly
on
procedural
or
jurisdictional
grounds
and
partly
on
the
merits.
the
central
issue
on
the
appeal
as
we
see
it,
is
whether
the
defendants
continued
enforcement
of
the
mississippi
voting
laws
attacked
in
the
complaint
is
unconstitutional,
because
enforcement
of
the
statutes
operates
to
deprive
negroes
of
the
right
to
vote
without
distinction
of
race
or
color
in
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
in
violation
of
section
1971
of
title
xlii
of
the
united
states
code.
we
submit
that
the
statutes
are
unconstitutional
and
that
they
are
enforcement
by
the
defendants
that
violates
section
1971
principally
for
two
independent
reasons.
first,
we
say
that
the
principal
statutes
involved
here
which
i
will
identify
in
a
moment,
delegate
to
petty
officials,
uncontrolled
discretion
to
qualify
or
disqualify
would
be
voters
in
a
community
in
which
every
political
force
is
mastered
to
preserve
white
political
supremacy.
and
that
that
discretion
is
discriminatorily
exercised
in
accordance
with
the
original
intent
of
the
statutes
and
the
systematic
practice
for
well
over
half
a
century
to
deny
negroes
the
equal
opportunity
to
vote.
this
aspect
of
our
case,
as
we
see
it,
is
based
upon
yick
wo
against
hopkins
and
in
very
brief
it
asserts
that
the
intended
and
actual
operation
of
the
state
laws,
condemns
them
exactly
as
if
the
racial
discrimination
were
written
into
the
words.
second,
we
say
that
the
mississippi
laws
or
the
principal
law
is
under
attack,
violate
the
fifteenth
amendment
because
they
establish
new
and
sharply
different
requirements
for
voting.
after
a
long
period
in
which
white
voters
were
permitted
to
register
and
negro
voters
possessing
the
same
qualifications
were
not
so
that
the
effect
of
the
new
and
sharply
different
requirements
is
to
perpetuate
a
form
of
discrimination
and
this
we
think
violates
the
fifteenth
amendment
under
the
principle
in
gwynn
against
the
united
states
and
lane
against
wilson.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
am
going
to
refer
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
i
was
stating
the
theories
at
this
point.
i
will
elaborate
them
later
so
that
the
court
may
have
them
in
mind
when
i
go
through
the
complaint.
because
it
is
obvious
from
the
mere
statement
of
the
theories
that
in
part,
they
depend
upon
the
actual
facts.
the
facts
are
those
set
forth
in
the
complaint
because
of
course,
the
motion
to
dismiss
admits
its
allegations
for
the
purposes
of
this
proceeding.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
intend
to
refer
to
one
or
two
incidents
as
illustrations
of
the
kind
of
thing
that
we
have
alleged,
as
indications
perhaps
of
the
proof
that
we
would
expect
to
introduce
in
support
of
it.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
there
is
any
further
need
to
rely
on
the
interrogatories
at
this
point.
we
think
the
facts
that
we
rely
on
are
all
sufficiently
alleged
in
the
complaint.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
as
i
say,
i
shall
refer
to
one
or
two
of
the
facts
of
the
interrogatories
to
show
that
specific
illustrations
of
the
generalization
that
i
take
it
i
could
do
that
even
if
they
weren't
in
the
interrogatories.
they
would
just
be
what
we
hope
to
prove.
now,
in
going
--
making
my
argument
and
in
going
through
the
complaint,
i
intend
to
emphasize
the
first
claim
just
because
there
is
too
much
here
to
argue
in
an
hour.
the
first
claim
is
directed
at
section
244
of
the
mississippi
constitution.
and
i
think
it
really
exemplifies
the
critical
issues
in
the
case,
i'll
tell
not
all
of
it.
the
complaint
begins
or
the
important
part
of
this
begins
at
2
and
3.
the
central
allegation
which
dominates
the
entire
case
is
contained
in
paragraphs
16
and
19.
that
allegation
is
that
it
is
the
continuing
all
pervasive
purpose
of
those
controlling
the
government
of
mississippi
to
establish,
promote
and
maintain
white
political
supremacy.
that
objective,
we
allege
in
paragraph
16
and
17,
was
one
of
the
principle
purposes
of
the
constitution
of
1899
--
of
1890,
and
section
244
was
one
of
its
principal
instruments.
in
its
original
form,
section
244
provided
for
a
new
registration
of
all
voters.
and
that
every
elector
in
addition
to
other
qualifications
shall
be
able
to
read
any
section
of
the
constitution
of
this
state
or
i
shall
be
able
to
understand
the
same
and
read
to
him
or
give
a
reasonable
interpretation
thereof.
by
1899,
about
82%
of
the
white
citizens
of
voting
age
had
been
registered
to
vote
under
the
1890
constitution
but
only
about
9%
of
the
negroes
of
that
age.
from
then
until
1952
according
to
paragraph
21
of
the
complaint,
section
244
was
one
of
the
principal
methods
used
to
maintain
white
political
supremacy
and
to
deny
negroes
equal
participation
or
effective
participation
in
voting,
because
negroes
who
could
read
were
nevertheless
required
to
interpret
provisions
of
the
mississippi
constitution.
i
may
say,
there
will
no
lack
of
evidence
to
prove
that
fight.
for
example,
there
were
registrars
who
testified
in
hearings
before
the
united
states
senate
in
1946
that
they
put
to
negro
voters
seeking
to
register
complicated
provisions
of
the
mississippi
constitution
to
interpret,
that
they
did
not
put
to
white
applicants.
one
voter
who
ask
if
he
remembered
making
the
statement,
no
matter
how
they,
negroes,
answered
these
questions,
that
they
were
disqualified
then.
i
think
i
told
them
in
short
words
that
they
would
have
a
hard
time
convincing
me.
i
think
i
made
that
statement.
in
the
mid-50s,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
cast
out
upon
the
continued
usefulness
of
section
244
for
this
purpose
because
it
held
in
accordance
with
the
rather
plain
meaning
of
the
words
of
the
original
form
of
section
244,
if
you
remember
them,
it
always
required
that
you
would
be
able
to
read
the
constitution
or
interpret
it.
and
upon
that
ruling,
the
section
became
a
considerably
less
effective
instrument.
a
campaign
was
then
undertaken
by
white
citizens
councils
as
we
allege
in
paragraphs
25,
27
and
29
to
amend
section
244
for
the
valid
purpose
of
preventing
the
further
qualification
of
negroes.
it's
significant
that
in
the
course
of
that
election,
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
explains
what
had
happened
very
vividly.
under
the
present
setup,
he
said
as
he
quoted
in
one
of
the
mississippi
papers,
“if
a
circuit
clerk
refuses
to
register
a
person
who
can
read
then
he
is
liable
for
damages
in
court
for
depriving
that
person
of
his
right.”
a
clerk
in
oklahoma
gets
sued
and
had
to
pay
$5,000.
this
scared
some
of
our
clerks
of
mississippi.
and
as
a
result
in
several
counties,
the
negroes
had
been
voting
in
large
numbers
and
then
he
went
on.
“in
other
words,
the
only
defense,
section
244,
we
now
have
is
now
trembling
and
we
need
additional
requirements
that
the
clerks
can
legally
impose.
the
time
is
short,
the
citizens
councils
in
each
community
they
are
in
the
position
to
perform
a
great
service
if
they
can
ensure
the
passage
of
this
amendment.
the
amendment
was
the
new
version
of
section
244.
it
is
set
out
on
page
106
in
the
back
of
our
brief.
in
its
present
form
it
provides,
every
elector
shall
in
addition
to
the
foregoing
qualifications,
be
able
to
read
and
write
any
section
of
the
constitution
of
this
state.
mr.
archibald
cox
a
106
of
the
government's
brief
in
number
73
--
be
able
to
read
and
write
putting
it
in
the
conjunctive
and
give
a
reasonable
interpretation
thereof
to
the
county
registrar.
and
then
it
added
a
new
requirement,
he
shall
demonstrate
to
the
county
registrar
a
reasonable
understanding
of
the
duties
and
obligations
of
citizenship
under
a
constitutional
form
of
government.
going
back
to
the
complaint,
after
explaining
in
paragraph
38
as
i
shall
explain
later,
how
the
new
form
of
section
244,
this
--
a
virtually
unlimited
discretion
of
the
registrars
to
determine
the
qualification
of
voters.
paragraph
41,
toward
the
bottom
of
page
6
and
page
7
of
the
record,
alleges
that
the
defendant
registrars
of
voters
have
used,
are
using
and
will
continue
to
use
the
interpretation
test,
that's
the
interpretation
of
the
state
constitution
and
the
duties
and
obligations
test
to
deprive
other
qualified
negro
--
otherwise
qualified
negro
citizens
of
the
right
to
register
to
vote
without
distinction
of
race
or
color
and
then
in
the
next
sentence,
it
says
that
the
existence
and
continued
enforcement
of
those
tests
could
--
well
--
is
deterring
and
will
continue
to
deter
otherwise
qualified
negroes
in
mississippi
for
applying
for
registration
to
vote.
the
effect
of
these
provisions
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
as
of
the
recent
count,
67%
of
the
white
persons
of
voting
age
in
mississippi
are
registered.
but
only
5%
of
the
negroes
--
mr.
archibald
cox
mississippi
has
a
permanent
registration.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
true.
mr.
archibald
cox
once
you're
on,
you're
on.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
i
understand
it,
whether
or
not
you
ever
vote,
which
means
of
course
that
when
you
raise
the
requirement,
you
are
raising
them
only
as
to
those
who
haven't
read
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
is
in
fact
the
grandfather
clause
and
you
can
see
where
the
argument
goes
from
there.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
we
have
it
in
massachusetts
and
i
assume
that
it
exist
in
to
great
many
states
and
i
would
assume
that
the
requirements
may
be
changed
from
time
to
time
under
circumstances
different
from
these
because
this
of
course
is
one
whole
picture
and
may
not
be
properly
broken
down
into
its
segments.
that
really
completes
the
first
claim
of
the
compliant
which
is
centered
on
section
244
as
it
now
stands
to
the
mississippi
constitution.
there
are
the
formal
allegations
of
course
that
the
defendants
are
intending
to
give
effect
to
section
244.
and
that
it
deprives
people
of
the
right
to
vote
as
i
just
read.
the
other
three
claims
carry
forward
the
story
of
mississippi's
attempts
to
prevent
negroes
from
voting.
i
really
haven't
time
to
summarize
them.
i
would
simply
say
that
when
the
court
comes
to
read
them
and
we
regard
them
as
important,
it's
just
the
problem
of
time
that
relate
in
the
court.
what
they
clearly
shows
is
a
story
of
action
and
reaction
in
which
every
attempt
by
the
congress
or
the
united
states
bringing
suit
to
enforce
equal
voting
rights
was
countered
by
the
adoption
of
new
laws
intended
to
put
obstructions
in
the
path
or
to
raise
new
obstacles.
thus,
the
new
requirements
that
were
added
in
the
1960
and
1962,
requiring
applicants
to
satisfy
the
registrar
of
their
good
moral
character
to
fill
out
the
application
far
unaided
a
letter
perfect
in
every
detail
to
prohibit
the
registrars
from
giving
the
reason
of
why
a
man
was
denied
registration
unless
it
was
lack
of
good
moral
character,
to
authorize
the
registrars
to
destroy
the
records
of
applications
and
of
action
thereof
which
had
been
maintained
previously
for
years.
another
new
statute
provided
that
for
the
publication
of
the
names
of
people
seeking
to
register
and
then
a
period
of
time
in
which
anyone
might
come
in
and
challenge
their
qualifications
including
their
good
moral
character.
or
the
effect
of
publication
in
an
atmosphere
of
intimidation
and
harassment
needs
no
elaboration.
as
i
say,
i'm
going
to
confine
myself
to
section
244.
for
the
purpose
of
that
section
in
the
first
claim,
of
course,
the
importance
of
this
additional
event
is
that
they
show
that
the
intent
to
preserve
white
political
supremacy
by
denying
negroes
effective
participation
in
the
political
process
does
continue.
i
come
back
down
to
the
two
legal
theories
on
which
we
urge
that
the
complaints
states
a
cause
of
action
for
enjoining
the
defendant
officials
and
the
state
from
the
enforcement
of
section
244
as
a
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
our
first
theory
is
that
the
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
constitution
and
understanding
of
citizenship
test
are
inherently
engines
of
racial
discrimination
as
they
have
been
administered
just
as
if
the
racial
discrimination
were
written
into
their
words.
it's
hardly
necessary
to
ague
that
section
244
is
so
losing
its
terms
as
to
give
registrars
virtually
unlimited
power
to
choose
who
will
pass
and
who
won't
pass.
for
many
years,
apparently,
the
registrars
were
free
to
put
or
not
put
--
to
test
or
not
test
an
applicant's
ability
to
interpret
a
provision
of
the
constitution.
i
am
not
sure
that
that's
true
today.
it
may
not
be.
it's
a
little
hard
to
tell.
in
any
event,
it
is
wholly
clear
today
that
the
registrars
select
the
provision
to
be
interpreted
from
several
hundred
possibilities
in
the
state
constitution.
senator
bilbo,
again
in
the
hearings
in
the
1940s
opposed
that
it
wasn't
the
poll
tax
that
kept
negroes
from
voting
that
it
was
section
244.
and
then
he
went
on
to
explain
fine
very
vivid
language.
the
circuit
clerks
are
under
oath
to
protect
the
provisions
of
that
constitution,
and
if
there
is
a
single
man
or
woman
serving
in
this
important
office
who
cannot
think
of
questions
enough
to
disqualify
undesirables
then
write
bilbo
or
any
good
lawyer
and
he
can
give
them
a
hundred
questions.
one
example
which
struck
me
which
was
often
given
to
negroes
was
the
provision
in
the
constitution
that
provides
that
judges
may
be
removed
for
a
reasonable
cause
not
constituting
grounds
for
impeachment.
i
wonder
if
we
can
all
with
a
bit
of
fun
think
of
meaning
for
that
but
i
wonder
how
many
lawyers
can
give
a
--
within
the
bar
can
give
a
really
accurate
interpretation
and
how
many
layman
in
the
back
of
the
courtroom
could
even
approach
giving
an
interpretation.
the
registrar
is
also
determined
of
whether
the
applicant's
answer
is
adequate
or
inadequate.
there
are
no
standards
in
this
statute
to
guide
their
discretion.
one
of
the
favorite
questions
put
the
white
voters
if
i
may
go
into
the
interrogatories
by
way
of
illustration
was
what
does
the
provision
in
the
constitution
mean
that
provides
there
shall
be
no
imprisonment
for
death.
the
answer
was,
i
think
that
a
nigger
should
have
two
years
in
college
before
voting
because
he
don't
understand.
that
voter
was
passed
does
understanding
the
prevision
relating
to
imprisonment
for
theft.
it
could
well
be
argued
i
think
that
such
a
delegation
of
power
making
the
right
vote
subject
to
the
uncontrolled
whim
of
a
petty
official
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
by
analogy
to
the
familiar
cases
dealing
with
the
licensing
of
the
distribution
of
pamphlets
or
the
licensing
of
the
solicitation
of
memberships
for
labor
unions.
especially
here
in
an
environment
of
racial
hostility
and
where
the
racial
purpose
of
the
law
is
plain
to
all
the
work.
that
was
indecently
the
ground
of
decision
by
the
three-judge
court
dealing
with
a
similar
alabama
statute
which
was
affirmed
by
this
court
in
davis
against
schnell.
we
don't
need
to
rely
on
that
argument,
however,
because
here,
the
complaint
also
shows
that
for
years,
more
than
seven
decades,
the
untrammeled
power
delegated
by
section
244
has
in
fact
been
administered
as
an
engine
of
discrimination.
i
quote
it
paragraphs
38
and
41
of
the
complaint
that
the
allegations
are
implicit
all
the
way
through
it.
excuse
me.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
so
that
all
of
this
is
admitted
for
the
purpose
--
mr.
archibald
cox
for
the
purposes
of
this
appeal
sir.
yes.
this
aspect
of
the
case,
were
the
allegation
of
those
facts.
we
say
it's
precisely
governed
by
yick
wo
against
hopkins
in
118
united
states
where
the
court
held
that
the
law
would
be
fair
on
its
phase
to
be
partial
in
appearance,
yet,
if
it
is
applied
and
administered
by
public
authority
were
so
evil
an
eye
and
unequal
hand
as
to
practically
make
unjust
and
the
illegal
discriminations
between
persons
of
similar
circumstances
material
to
their
rights.
the
denial
of
equal
justice
is
still
within
the
prohibition
of
the
constitution.
i
would
go
on
and
emphasize
that
our
case
should
even
be
stronger
than
yick
wo.
here,
the
practice
in
using
the
interpretation
test
to
bar
negroes
for
voting
while
registering
white
citizens
with
no
better
qualifications
was
not
solely
the
unauthorized
act
of
the
registrars.
it
conformed
to
the
intent.
i
am
speaking
now
of
intent
as
we
usually
use
it
in
interpreting
statutes
and
not
of
some
motive
to
apply
some
legislative
voting
but
of
intent
in
that
sense.
it
conformed
to
the
legislative
intent.
at
the
mississippi
constitutional
convention
of
1890
which
the
complaint
alleges
was
dedicated
to
finding
ways
of
disenfranchising
negroes.
one
delegate
remark,
it
looks
as
if
it
is
referring
the
section
244
was
intended
that
if
i
register
want
a
demand
to
vote,
he
would
read
him
some
--
such
clause
as
slavery
except
as
a
punishment
for
crime
should
be
prohibited.
do
you
understand
this?
oh
yes.
but
if
he
did
not
wanting
to
vote,
he
would
read
him
the
interstate
clause
or
the
section
forbidding
the
legislature
to
pass
ex
post
facto
laws
and
demand
the
construction.
and
that
is
i
have
shown
and
as
the
complaint
alleges
that
i
have
shown
from
the
complaint
was
also
the
intent
of
the
1955
amendment
which
was
intended
to
revive
this
engine
of
discrimination.
i'd
emphasized
too
that
the
same
purpose
runs
through
other
mississippi
voting
laws.
and
the
conductive
scores
of
state
officials
as
alleged
in
the
complaint.
the
1890
constitution
was
described
by
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
as
one
which
swept
the
circle
of
expedience
to
obstruct
the
exercise
of
suffrage
by
the
negro
race,
the
adoption
of
the
amendments
to
section
244
certainly
have
that
purpose.
the
laws
adopted
in
1960
and
1962
are
most
notably
the
one
calling
for
the
publication
of
the
names
of
anybody
seeking
to
register.
it
showed
very
plainly
that
the
entire
mississippi
government
unhappily
still
persists
in
the
purposes
alleged
in
the
complaint.
in
short
and
perhaps
i
belabor
in
obvious
point,
whatever
may
have
been
true
if
only
the
words
were
whatever
may
have
been
true
--
if
only
the
words
were
available,
the
experience
of
74
years
shows
that
section
244
stands
now,
not
as
an
invitation
to
the
exercise
of
the
trammeled
discretion
in
deciding
who
shall
vote
in
a
community
where
every
power
has
been
mobilized
to
bar
negro
subjects.
the
original
intent
and
the
consistent
practice
have
written
the
meaning
in
to
the
words
which
is
well
understood
by
the
registrars,
the
election
officials
and
equally
well
understood
by
the
negroes
whom
they
notify
that
it
is
useless
to
apply.
under
those
conditions,
we
submit,
any
further
enforcement
of
section
244
in
any
court
is
as
violated
with
the
fifteenth
amendment
as
i
will
show
later
of
section
1971,
is
if
racial
discrimination
were
written
into
the
words
of
the
statute.
here,
again,
yick
wo
is
squarely
in
point.
as
the
court
--
this
court
has
repeatedly
pointed
out
in
later
cases,
yick
wo
held
that
not
merely
the
administration
of
the
san
francisco
apartment
but
the
ordinance
itself
was
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
say
very
simply
to
say
in
principle
applies
here.
it
is
too
late
now
to
attempt
to
separate
the
abstract
words
of
section
244
from
demeaning
part
into
them
by
their
framers
and
by
their
practical
interpretation
for
seven-and-a-half
decade.
after
so
long
period,
the
defendants
can't
be
heard
to
say,
well,
maybe
we
could
find
some
way
to
give
these
tests
a
constitutional
application.
i
think
the
two
familiar
principles
that
confirm
this
conclusion
if
any
confirmation
is
needed,
what
is
the
role
where
the
very
existence
of
a
broad
statute
unconstitutionally
in
some
of
its
applications,
operates
as
a
restraint
upon
the
exercise
of
fundamental
freedoms,
then
the
court
will
invalidate
the
whole
statute,
enjoin
its
enforcement
in
total
without
casting
about
to
try
and
sever
and
save
little
bits
of
it
here
and
there.
smith
and
california
is
perhaps
one
of
the
best
statements
of
that
rule.
the
familiar
cases
deal
with
speech
and
freedom
of
association,
which
surely,
the
right
to
vote
is
entitled
no
less
protection.
for
74
years,
section
244
has
been
an
instrument
for
defeating
the
efforts
of
negroes
to
vote
without
distinction
of
race
and
color.
it
is
highly
speculative
whether
it
could
be
given
any
meaning
non-discriminatory
and
therefore
constitutional
application.
its
continued
enforcement
carries
inherent
in
it
inescapably
a
threat
of
continued
racial
discrimination.
and
under
some
circumstances,
we
say,
the
court
should
remove
the
entire
barrier
if
we
prove
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
by
enjoining
the
defendants
from
acting
at
anyway,
carrying
out
section
244.
the
second
supporting
principle
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think,
we
say
very
much
what
the
court
said
in
yick
wo.
we
think
that
this
statute
might
well
be
held
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
we
don't
press
the
point
particularly
because
we
don't
need
to,
because
we
say
that
in
--
it
has
been
enforced
in
such
a
way
four
years
as
to
show
that
it
is
an
engine
of
discrimination.
and
we
say
that
as
the
court
held
in
yick
wo
and
on
the
face
of
that
record,
the
statute
like
the
ordinance
in
yick
wo
should
be
held
on
constitutional.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
half
a
dozen
occasion
on
which
this
court
said
that
the
ordinance
had
been
held
unconstitutional
in
yick
wo
as
well
as
the
practice
under
it.
and
i'm
suggesting
essentially
two
principles
that
i
think
support
it.
one
is
the
principle
stated
in
the
smith
case
that
whether
a
statute
unconstitutional
in
some
of
its
application
or
where
it's
an
area
of
fundamental
liberties
or
where
it
is
in
--
and
where
its
existence
operates
as
a
restraint
upon
those
liberties
then
the
court
will
strike
down
the
whole
statute.
i
think
much
of
that
reasoning
lest
it
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
decision
in
yick
wo.
then
the
second
supporting
reason
we
suggest
is
the
familiar
role
that
once
a
wrong
is
proved
and
here,
the
most
serious
wrong
then
in
order
to
provide
effective
relief,
the
court
of
equity
will
enjoin
whatever
conduct
is
necessary
to
give
complete
relief.
and
it
may
enjoin
conduct
withstanding
by
itself
and
in
another
context
reviewed
abstractly
might
have
been
held
to
be
loved
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
principle
which
perhaps
we
encounter
most
often
in
antitrust
cases
purports
a
general
equitable
principle.
you
can
find
it
in
an
unfair
competition
cases
and
others
is
also
applicable
to
this
kind
of
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
there
are
the
--
yes,
let
me
give
a
little
larger
answer
than
to
your
immediate
question.
the
complaint
was
framed
on
a
number
of
grounds
and
i
don't
want
to
indicate
that
we
waive
them.
we've
stressed
in
our
brief,
the
two
i
emphasized
here,
those
are
the
ones
we
principally
rely.
but
the
draftsman
of
the
complaint
had
some
other
various
in
mind
as
well
as
this.
i
think
these
fairly
appear.
one
of
them
was
that
in
a
state
where
there
has
been
systematically
different
education
for
white
children
the
negro
children.
then
to
apply
an
understanding,
a
civic
test
to
put
in
short
hand
is
itself
discriminatory
because
you
have
educated
one
group
to
pass
it
and
you
haven't
educated
the
other.
mr.
archibald
cox
right,
now
the
second
theory
that
enters
in
--
that
entered
into
the
complaint
was
that
this
test
requiring
you
to
interpret
any
provision
of
the
constitution
is
not
reasonably
related
in
any
sense
to
qualification
to
vote
and
therefore
doesn't
come
within
the
states
normal
power
to
fix
the
qualifications
of
elected.
i
think
there
was
also
a
theory
which
i
have
alluded
to
and
not
withdrawn
from
although
i
say
we
don't
emphasize
it
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face
for
the
reason
that
it
was
so
vague
too.
but
that
was
the
reason
that
was
in
the
case
and
as
i
say,
we
don't
drop
it
out
but
to
get
by
the
motion
to
dismiss,
we
don't
to
rely
upon
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
louisiana
of
course
involves
the
next
case.
mississippi,
alabama
attempted
to
adopt
one.
i
am
not
familiar
with
any
others.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
don't
think
there's
--
i
don't
think
any
--
there
are
states
that
have
literacy
test.
but
i
don't
know
of
any
state
that
has
this
to
interpret
any
provision
of
the
state
constitution.
i'm
told
that
south
carolina
has
one.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
don't
think
that
we
have
to
show
the
statute
is
void
on
its
face.
the
words
abstracted
from
the
events,
it
ordered
to
obtain
relief
that
says
“don't
give
any
effect
to
that
statute”.
we
think
that
the
lesson
of
yick
wo
is
that
where
you
have
this
long
period
of
administration
which
writes
a
gloss
on
the
statute
for
everyone
to
see
that
that
becomes
part
of
the
law,
that
practice
that
you
would
join
giving
any
effect
to
the
statute.
so
i
was
saying
we
think
that's
the
lesson
of
yick
wo.
we
think
it's
the
principle
of
cases
like
smith
against
california
which
is
applicable
to
the
voting
cases.
we
think
we're
entitled
to
adhere
as
i
was
attempting
to
elaborate
a
moment
ago
on
the
principle
that
even
if
the
statute
conceivably
could
have
been
given
some
proper
application
on
its
face
once
that
we're
entitled
enjoin
the
whole
thing
to
give
us
effective
relief.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
we'd
undoubtedly
be
entitled
to
it
even
if
it
isn't
quite
on
its
face.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
we
think
that
as
i
suggest
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
but
if
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
even
if
it
isn't
quite
(voice
overlap).
yes,
at
the
principle,
i
don't
think
i
should
take
more
time
to
elaborate
it
but
the
principles
that
we
have
cited
the
case
in
our
brief
is
that
your
are
entitled
to
effective
relief
quite
frankly
after
some
years
of
experience,
we
find
that
efforts
to
deal
with
discrimination
case
by
case
by
case
move
so
slowly
and
they
are
so
difficult
to
prove
that
--
that
they
perhaps
ultimately
will
remove
the
obstacles
which
they
would
turn
that
kind
of
relief
that
would
simply
leave
section
244
as
an
obstacle
that
people
might
eventually
get
over
rather
than
wiping
away
the
fundamentally
wrong
interest.
mr.
archibald
cox
we're
asking
an
opportunity
to
try
our
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
be
happy
to
have
that
relief
but
we
have
not
pressed
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
have
not
pressed
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
intended
to
not
to
wait.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
intend
not
to
abandon
it
mr.
justice
but
we
do
not
press
it.
i
think
that's
the
other
statement.
now,
our
second
independent
reason
which
also
goes
i
think
for
the
question
of
relief
mr.
justice
black
for
attacking
section
244
as
it
stands
today
and
for
attacking
if
one
can
conceive
it
that
theoretically
fair
test
of
ability
to
interpret
the
constitution.
is
that
to
apply
new
and
radically
different
standards
to
people
who
are
not
registered
today
in
a
community
where
only
5%
of
the
negroes
who
are
eligible
--
old
enough
to
vote
have
been
allowed
to
register
and
something
like
67%
or
70%
of
the
whites
are
already
permanently
registered
is
itself
discriminatory
as
to
who
is
prevented
to
vote
which
is
what
you
are
concerned
with.
because
it
means
that
the
negro
the
previous
victim
of
discrimination
is
now
in
fact
compelled
to
pass
a
higher
--
a
different
test
that
was
applicable
to
the
white
citizens.
and
in
principle
of
course
this
is
just
gwynn
against
the
united
states,
lane
and
wilson
as
the
principal
has
been
adopted
by
the
courts
in
this
fifth
circuit
for
some
period.
now,
that
ground
which
perhaps
we
would
have
to
prove
our
facts
in
order
to
be
entitled
to
that
relief
that
relief
would
certainly
strike
down
section
244
or
any
application
of
244
which
would
be
bound
to
be
a
new
in
different
test
today
since
there
has
been
no
uniformed
valid
test
in
the
past.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
i
turn
now
to
the
ruling
of
the
district
court
that
the
united
states
is
not
entitled
to
maintain
this
action.
under
title
xlii
of
the
united
states
code,
section
1971
and
that
appears
in
my
brief
beginning
at
page
99.
section
1971
provides
leaving
out
the
unimportant
words,
all
citizens
of
the
united
states
who
are
otherwise
qualified
by
law
to
vote
shall
be
entitled
and
allowed
to
vote
at
all
such
elections
without
distinction
of
race,
color
or
previous
condition
of
servitude.
any
constitution
law,
custom
usage
or
regulation
of
any
state
or
territory
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding,
then
you'll
notice
that
subsection
c,
authorizes
the
attorney
general
to
sue
for
preventive
relief
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
whatever
any
person
has
engaged
or
the
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
any
person
is
about
to
engage,
in
any
act
or
practice
which
would
deprive
any
other
person
of
any
right
or
privilege
secured
by
subsection
a.
the
same
allegations
which
charges
the
enforcement
of
section
244
violates
the
fifteenth
amendment,
the
ones
that
i've
just
developed
of
bringing
the
case
within
section
1971
(a),
giving
effect
to
the
reasonable
interpretation
in
citizenship
test
is
certainly
an
act
or
practice
to
its
conduct
by
the
state
officials
and
the
people
who
give
effect
to
it.
the
state
officials
named
as
defendants
are
obviously
present
to
subject
negroes
seeking
to
vote
to
discriminatory
test
of
their
qualifications,
deprives
them
of
the
right
to
vote
without
distinction
of
race
or
color.
only
other
requirement
is
certainly
met
by
the
complaint
which
alleges
with
sufficient
clarity
that
the
victims
of
the
discrimination
were
otherwise
qualified
to
vote
that
is
to
say
they
met
the
non-discriminate
--
they
met
the
test
applied
to
white
citizens.
indeed,
those
allegations
as
i
pointed
out
earlier,
are
summarized
almost
in
the
words
of
section
1971,
in
paragraph
41
of
the
complaint.
one
can
look
at
it
in
its
original
form
on
page
7
or
as
it
was
amended
over
on
our
66.
it
makes
no
difference
in
this
instance
because
the
passage
i
have
in
mind
is
both.
it
said
the
registrars
have
used
or
using
and
will
continue
to
use
the
interpretation
test
and
the
duties
and
obligations
test
to
deprive
otherwise
qualified
negro
citizens
of
the
right
to
vote
without
distinction
of
race
or
color.
and
then
in
the
next
sentence,
it
spoke
of
the
existence
and
the
enforcement
of
those
tests
as
deterrent
otherwise
qualified
negroes
from
applying
for
registration
to
vote.
you'll
find
over
in
paragraph
42
(b)
that
the
allegation
is
that
section
244
perpetuates
prior
discrimination
against
negroes
from
possessing
similar
qualifications
to
those
of
the
whites
who
were
permitted
to
register
and
vote.
it
goes
on
to
describe
section
244
as
an
engine
of
discrimination.
now,
certainly,
we
weren't
required
in
the
complaint
to
list
all
the
events
that
we
required
--
that
we
relied
upon
to
make
out
the
practice
of
consistent
interpretation
that
we
alleged.
most
of
the
particulars
that
did
come
out
from
the
answers
to
interrogatories,
of
course
ever
since
they
got
those
particulars,
the
appellees
have
been
alleging
that
they
weren't
part
of
the
record
but
they
have
them
available.
now,
the
appellee
raises
a
number
of
objections
to
the
application
of
section
1971,
which
i
must
confess,
it
seemed
to
me,
almost
frivolous.
but,
in
order
to
try
to
do
them
justice,
i
want
to
take
them
up
as
they're
set
out
in
the
brief
for
the
defendant
registrars.
at
first,
they
say
from
pages
14
to
19
that
section
1971
authorizes
only
a
proceeding
for
preventive
relief.
but
one
under
the
request
we
made
here
is
that
the
defendants
be
enjoined
for
continuing
to
give
effect
to
this
--
to
the
statute.
i
can't
think
of
anything
that
it
is
more
preventive
than
continuing
to
give
effect
to
that
statute.
we
did
ask
for
some
other
relief,
and
we
think
we're
entitled
to
it.
we
think
it's
preventive
but,
whether
it
is
or
not,
it
doesn't
need
to
be
debated
at
this
stage
of
the
case
because
we
certainly
did
include
at
that
appropriate
request
that
i've
already
mentioned.
then
going
on
page
19,
the
appellees
say,
“the
attorney
general
has
had
no
standing
under
section
1971
to
attack
constitutionality”.
and
under
that,
subsection
c
does
not
attempt
to
invest
the
attorney
general
with
authority
to
attack
the
provisions
of
a
state's
statutes.
it
speaks
exclusively
of
acts
or
practices
of
persons.well,
of
course,
to
take
it
literally,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
fantastic
argument
of
why
you
speak
of
enjoining
the
enforcement
of
the
statute.
it's
simply
a
shorthand
for
referring
to
the
acts
and
practices
of
the
enforcement
officials
to
the
conduct
of
the
state
officials
giving
effect
to
it.
to
say
that
the
attorney
general
has
no
authority
to
attack
the
constitutionality
of
the
state's
statute
under
this
section,
which
say
that
for
mississippi
to
pass
a
law
which
in
terms
discriminated
against
negroes
in
voting
could
not
be
attacked
by
the
united
states
under
section
1971.
but
surely,
that
is
not
either
the
language
or
the
intent
of
section
1971.
even
the
appellees
have
seem
to
find
that
argument
a
bit
sticky
because
they
go
on
and
say
on
page
22,
“we
would
not
contend
that
a
state
could
put
unconstitutionally
discriminatory
action
by
a
registrar
beyond
the
reach
of
a
proper
proceeding
for
preventive
relief
under
1971
by
passing
an
act
attempting
to
authorize
the
discrimination.
the
proper
way
such
void
law
should
be
said
if
not,
would
be
a
proceeding
against
the
enforcement
official,
the
registrar
to
enjoin
and
prevent
his
application
of
such
statute”.
well,
we've
asked
that
the
defendants
be
enjoined
from
enforcing
and
giving
any
further
effect
to
the
statutes.
i
can't
believe
that
anybody
seriously
distinguishes
between
the
word
applied
to
the
statute
and
our
choice
of
enforcing
or
giving
effective.
and
we
have
joined
here
some
defendant
registrars.
i
suppose
that
this
juncture,
the
appellee
might
say,
well,
the
passage
that
the
solicitor
general
just
read,
deals
with
the
statute
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
and,
we
didn't
intend
it
to
apply
to
one
which
is
unconstitutional
when
it's
consistent
in
the
interpretation
it
showed.
but
that
point,
i'd
come
back
again
to
the
words
of
section
1971
that
suggests
that
a
distinction,
if
that's
what
they
mean,
is
irrelevant.
section
1971
as
this
word
show
is
concerned
with
acts
or
practices
depriving
otherwise
qualified
citizens
of
the
right
to
vote
but
without
distinction
of
race
or
color.
it
doesn't
matter
how
it's
done,
it
may
be
done
by
an
official
or
acting
contrary
to
state
statute.
it
may
be
done
by
an
official
on
carrying
out
his
duty
under
a
statute
which
commands
discrimination
on
its
face.
or,
it
maybe
done
we
say
and
certainly
this
is
true
so
far
as
the
words
that
1971
go,
by
an
official,
giving
effect
to
a
statute
which
is
unconstitutional
because
of
the
rubric
written
on
it
as
well
as
its
words
or
by
years
of
actual
practice.
now,
if
our
substantive
theory
were
wrong
on
that
point,
then
of
course,
it
wouldn't
come
under
1971
(a).
but,
if
our
substantive
theory
is
right,
clearly
in
its
action
to
enjoin
these
officials,
thus
come
under
section
1971
act.
now,
i've
already
stated
our
reasons
for
arguing
that
we're
right
and
there's
no
need
for
me
to
elaborate
it
further.
the
other
point
that
i
have
time
to
devote
myself
to
is
the
argument
raised
by
the
state
of
mississippi,
that
we
have
no
right
to
join
mississippi
as
a
defendant.
we
did
join
her
because
the
basic
wrong
in
this
case
is
the
deliberate,
as
we
see
it,
long
continued
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
by
the
enactment
and
operation
of
racially
discriminatory
voting
laws,
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
white
political
supremacy,
action
in
which
all
the
arguments
of
the
state
have
joined
and
action
as
we
allege
taken
throughout
the
state
of
mississippi.
in
joining
the
state
as
a
defendant
and
i
want
to
emphasize
this,
we
joined
the
state.
we
refer
to
the
state
in
exactly
the
same
sense
that
the
word
state
is
used
in
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
many
other
provisions
of
the
original
constitution
as
well
as
other
amendments.
we
think
to
joinder
is
clearly
proper
under
the
second
paragraph
of
section
1971
(c)
still
on
page
a
hundred
of
my
brief.
it
provides
that
whenever
any
state
official
is
alleged
to
deprive
anyone
of
the
right
to
vote
without
distinction
of
race
or
color,
the
act
or
practice
shall
also
be
deemed
that
of
the
state,
and
the
state
may
be
joined
as
a
party
defendant.
the
evident
theory
of
the
provision
is
that
when
the
suit
is
brought
by
the
united
states,
the
state
may
be
treated
as
other
corporate
bodies
that
held
responsible
for
the
acts
of
its
officials
within
the
scope
of
their
agencies
--
scope
of
their
employment.
it's
in
this
sense
that
we
seek
a
decree
against
the
state
of
the
practical
aim,
and
of
course
the
practical
consequence,
is
to
hold
the
state
responsible
and
to
enjoin
all
the
persons,
the
agents
for
whom
the
state
might
act
for
the
continued
interference
with
voting
rights
in
violation
of
--
under
section
244,
as
just
as
one
who
would
obtain
a
similar
decree
binding
any
other
corporate
body
pursuing
a
collectivity
here
a
group
of
people
in
their
organized
capacity
and
organized
governmental
capacity
in
this
instance,
not
some
abstraction.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
next
--
if
the
registrar
had
resigned
--
mr.
archibald
cox
we
could.
otherwise,
i
think
that
we
have
to
join
some
registrars,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
let
me
just
qualify
that
--
that
the
qualification
is
important
to
this
case
but
this
is
always
the
future.
we
couldn't
under
section
1971.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
in
the
district
court,
yes.
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
the
other
officials
that
we
named,
yes.
and
perhaps
--
and
other
officials
charged
with
--.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
there
is
that
argument
which
i
prefer
to
leave
to
the
briefs
about
whether
to
joinder
was
proper.
we
think
that
this
--
that
the
statute
and
the
common
purpose
brings
this
within
the
provision
of
the
rule
as
to
joinders.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
i
think
so.
also,
yes.
also,
i
may
say
that
these
people
would
all
be
bound
by
a
decree
against
the
state
even
if
they
hadn't
been
personally
joined
because
the
decree
against
the
state
of
course
will
cover
its
agency
so
that
the
question
of
the
other
people
would
become
moot
in
the
sense
if
the
decree
went
against
the
state.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
--
even
declaring
the
statute
void
on
its
face,
it
usually
requires
that
allegation
that
someone
has
done
something
to
enforce
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
well,
that
would
be
enough
to
bring
the
case
within
1971
because
we
would
have
in
the
words
of
1971,
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
the
person
was
about
to
engage
in
an
act
or
practice
and
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
no.
wait
a
minute.
i
overstate
it.
i
misspoke
myself.
the
word
about
to
engage
apparently
isn't
carried
forward
into
the
second
paragraph.
it
is
in
the
first
paragraph.i
thought
it
was
in
the
second,
but
as
i
look
at
it
very
quickly,
it's
not
in
the
second.
so,
i
suppose
we
would
have
to
allege
that
somebody
did
something.
but,
we
certainly
have
alleged
that
here
many,
many
times.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
say
that
we
can
but
we
don't
--
we
don't
think
we
need
to
rely
on
that
because
this
is
a
much
easier
argument.
we
haven't
briefed
it.
again,
i'm
--
i
just
don't
want
the
same
to
waive
something
that
might
someday
be
important.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
also
that
would
not
be
quite
--
again,
it
would
not
be
quite
the
same
as
this.
we
thought
that
as
an
easier
problem
than
this
one
would
be.
the
court
--
both
the
district
court
held
in
section
1971
was
not
applicable
simply
because
it
thought
there
would
be
some
constitutional
doubts
about
its
validity.
if
it
were
construed
to
cover
this
case,
we
think
that
the
ruling
was
wrong
for
four
reasons.
the
first
place,
it
flies
squarely
in
the
phase
of
section
1971.
the
statute
says,
whatever
it
is
alleged
that
the
state
official
has
deprived
anyone
of
this
1971
rights,
then
the
act
or
practice
shall
be
deemed
that
of
the
state,
and
the
state
maybe
joined
as
a
defendant.
there's
simply
no
room
for
interpretation.
the
case
squarely
fits
the
word.
second,
what
little
legislative
history
there
is,
as
we
showed
in
our
brief,
indicates
that
the
congress
intended
the
words
to
be
given
their
natural
scope.
at
one
stage,
the
bill
was
more
narrowly
drawn
to
cover
the
specific
problem
of
what
had
been
raised
in
united
states
against
alabama
of
registrars
who
would
resign
pending
suit.
and
the
bill
was
introduced
to
cover
that
problem.
and
in
the
hearings,
it
was
said,
well,
there
are
a
lot
of
other
things
that
may
happen.
and
as
a
result,
congressman
mcculloch
came
in
with
a
new
bill
which
contained
the
present
language.
we
think
on
those
facts,
it's
certainly
a
fair
inference
that
the
language
was
intended
to
have
its
full
scope
and
avoid
all
these
problems.
third,
there
is
not
the
slightest
constitutional
doubt
that
the
united
states
may
sue
a
state.
i
argued
such
case
here
only
in
december.
there
are
many
occasions,
ever
since
united
states
against
texas
in
143
united
states
on
which
it's
been
held
that
a
state
has
no
immunity
from
suit
by
the
united
states.
fourth,
there
is
no
constitutional
principle
that
a
state,
being
a
perfect
idealism
may
commit
no
wrong.
there
are
many
provisions
in
the
constitution,
indeed
in
the
original
constitution
that
are
plainly
addressed
to
states,
things
that
only
a
state
could
do
like
entering
into
a
compact
with
another
state,
enacting
an
ex
post
facto
law,
enacting
a
law
impairing
the
obligation
of
contract.
and
this
court
has
said
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
was
intended
to
have
the
same
impact
on
the
state
as
those
original
provisions.
it
may
well
be
that
fifteenth
amendment
certainly
took
account
of
the
fact
that
states
could
deny
the
right
to
vote
without
distinction
of
race
or
color.
it
may
well
be
that
the
consequence
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
is
that
an
effort
to
authorize
someone
to
engage
in
that
discrimination
does
not
confer
upon
in
the
sovereignty
of
the
state.
so
that
he
cannot
be
sued
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
but,
it
certainly
doesn't
go
in
the
theory
that
there's
no
way
in
which
a
state
can
commit
a
violation.
and
if
as
it
has
been
held
that
a
state
may
be
sued
by
the
united
states
for
breach
of
contract,
for
wrongful
occupation
of
property,
for
tort,
for
taxes,
for
interfering
with
the
activities
of
federal
officials,
then
certainly
it
can
also
be
sued
for
violating
the
constitutional
rights
of
citizens.
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
is
just
two
points,
mr.
chief
justice
that
i
would
like
to
touch
upon
very
briefly.
during
my
argument
before
a
luncheon,
i
spoke
at
various
times
of
the
statute
to
voting
statute
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
that
is
simply
upon
the
words,
that
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
living
reality.
of
course,
i
simply
wished
to
allude
to
the
fact
that
several
of
the
cases
that
have
been
before
this
court
where
statutes
were
invalidated
have
been
cases
where
it
was
--
the
statute
as
applied
to
reality.
that
was
true
in
the
gwynn
case.
reading
the
statute
alone,
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
gwynne
case.
it
was
true
in
lane
and
wilson.
it
was
true
in
the
gomillion
and
lightfoot
but
simply
reading
it
alone,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
it.
and
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
in
addition
to
yick
wo,
there
is
of
course
the
landmark
case
of
grosjean
against
american
press
where
there's
a
very
pertinent
language
that
i
should
have
put
in
my
brief
by
chief
justice
hughes.
the
other
point
to
which
i
wanted
to
address
myself
very
briefly
is
the
alleged
inability
to
sue
the
state,
as
i
understand,
it
in
sovereign
capacity.
now,
one
thing
that
is
perfectly
clear
is
that
the
constitution
is
addressed
to
the
states
as
chief
justice
white
put
it,
acting
in
their
governmental
capacity,
he
says
in
the
passages
that
i
won't
read,
they're
quoted
in
out
brief
from
the
home
telephone
case,
the
effect
that
the
amendment
speaking
of
the
fourteenth
proceeds
upon
the
assumption
that
the
states
acting
in
their
governmental
capacity
in
a
complete
sense
may
do
acts
that
conflict
with
its
provision.
and
certainly,
therefore,
the
constitution
contains
no
barrier
to
the
united
states
which
can
sue
a
state,
suing
to
hold
the
state
within
its
domain,
but
that's
what
this
suit
is
about.
the
constitution
we
entered
into
it
for
the
purpose
of
limiting
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
for
one
reason
with
many
limitations
in
section
10
of
article
i,
obviously
addressed
to
the
states
in
their
governmental
capacity,
things
like
entering
into
treaties.
and
this
is
a
suit
not
to
destroy
the
state
of
mississippi,
not
to
interfere
with
its
establishing
constitutional
voting
qualification
but
to
enjoin
a
violation
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
don't
think
that
case
is
in
here.
we
cited
the
california
safety
appliance
case
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
thought
it
relied
on
a
provision
of
the
statute,
if
we
may.
i
neglected
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
with
it?
mr.
archibald
cox
and
of
course,
and
all
of
these
provisions
carried
with
them
some
surrender
of
sovereignty.
the
distinction
that
was
offered
between
the
state
acting
in
its
proprietary
capacity
and
governmental
capacity
simply
won't
do.
that
was
the
very
pointed
issues
that
was
argued
in
the
california
case
and
the
court
rushed
to
decide.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
of
course..
but
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
it
does.
i
think
i
have
been
involved.
the
other
point
i
wanted
to
make
was
that
in
every
one
of
these
kinds
of
cases
or
suits
by
the
united
states
against
the
state,
it
could
equally
well
have
been
said
the
state
can
do
no
wrong,
the
state
can
commit
no
trespass,
the
state
can
commit
no
act
deserving
of
a
penalty,
the
state
cannot
commit
no
tort
for
which
we
sue
it
for
burning
down
our
timber,
i
suppose
the
answer
may
be
that
we
are
suing
the
state
in
this
governmental
capacity
in
which
it
can
and
plainly
has
done
wrong,
and
it's
in
that
capacity
which
the
constitution
speaks
of
it.
it's
in
that
capacity
that
it's
named
as
a
defendant
and
would
be
enjoined
to
the
decree.
there
is
no
attempt
to
destroy
it
in
its
ideal
sovereign
capacity
or
to
interfere
with
its
legitimate
governmental
operations.
