justice
hugo
l.
black
excuse
me,
mr.
lee.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
you
said
not
to,
but
suppose
every
word
he
alleges
is
the
truth
and
he
could
prove
it,
would
you
say
that
the
lawyer
could
be
fined
for
alleging
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you
are
arguing
that
even
though
what
the
alleged
is
true,
the
judge
had
a
right
to
sentence
him
for
contempt
for
the
language
he
used.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah,
which
language?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
putting
your
finger
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
language
you
say
used
by
itself
is
sufficient?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
part
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
read
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
part
now
that
just
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
you
say
the
language
itself
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
way
he
said
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
enough
to
sentence
for
contempt.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
tells
the
truth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
part
of
that
language
itself
adds
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
had
to
accuse
him
of
that,
if
that's
what
you
said
he'd
been
guilty
of?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
manner
here
it
claims
straight
language?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
would
you
put
your
hand
on
the
other
language?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
language
alone.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
let's
suppose
--
let's
suppose
that
you've
said
this
in
both
the
[inaudible]
the
language
that
you
would
say
would
not
be
accepted
now,
let's
suppose
he
had
said
it
in
the
language
that
you
wouldn't
criticize
and
he
could
prove
it.
would
you
say
then
that
he
could
be
sentenced
for
contempt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
he
buttress,
he
has
to
allege
first.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
wasn't
fined
was
he
for
failing
to
file
affidavit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
don't
--
you
don't
rely
on
that,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
now,
suppose
this
was
a
language
that
he
didn't
criticize
and
submitted
that
to
the
judge
and
the
judge
said,
?i'm
not
going
to
try
that
out.
i
will
sentence
you
for
contempt.
you
never
should
have
charged
me
with
that.?
would
you
say
that
you
could
sustain
that
conviction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
now
which
is
16
now
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
another
part
of
language
--
is
that
because
of
the
language
itself?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
you
add
to
that
and
you
said
he
could
not
a
fair
trial
in
the
circuit.
aren't
there
many
?
aren't
there
many
cases
in
which
the
lawyers
charged
that
the
--
the
judge
won't
give
him
a
fair
trial
and
not
many
in
particular
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
--
i
understand
your
issue
there.
you
would
say
that
if
he
had
used
more
polite
language
or
a
little
different
language
and
had
presented
affidavits
to
buttress
it
and
the
judge
had
said,
?i
sentence
you
for
contempt
of
court
for
filing
those
papers,?
you
would
agree
that
you
could
not
stand
with
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
i'm
talking
about
the
judge
now
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
judge
here
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
getting
in
the
language
that
we
have
--
the
question
we
have,
you
would
say
then
that
the
judge's
judgment
should
be
set
aside
because
he
is
denying
due
process,
would
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
am
not
talking
about
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
the
allegation
here
in
the
language
that
you
would
approve.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
charge
that
the
judge
was
biased
and
prejudiced
and
he
wanted
to
move
it
over
and
he
buttressed
it
with
affidavit
and
he
harassed
him.
would
you
say
that
the
judge
could
file
--
could
sentence
him
to
jail
for
contempt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
couldn't
with
the
deny
due
process?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
denied?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
he
was
denied
any
right
that's
guaranteed
under
federal
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
assuming
now
that
he
has
alleged
the
cause
of
action
to
show
that
the
judge
is
biased
and
prejudiced
against
him.
he
has
shown
it
by
the
harassment
and
that
the
judge
then
says,
just
for
filing
that
paper,
i
sentence
you
for
contempt
of
court.
i'll
give
you
no
chance
to
prove
it.
would
you
say
that
denied
in
due
process?
