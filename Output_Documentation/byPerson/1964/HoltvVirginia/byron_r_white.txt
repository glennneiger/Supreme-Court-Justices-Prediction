justice

well,
i
suppose
that
under
your
own
criteria
that
it's
the
wrong
thing,
that
if
there
could
be
something
wrong
or
disrespectful
said
in
the
motion
for
change
of
venue
that
could
justify
finding
of
contempt?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
still
have
--
we
still
have
the
question
of
whether
how
to
characterize
the
language
that
was
used?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
matter
what
kind
of
constitutional
language
which
you
--
constitutional
words
you
use
about
this,
we
still
have
to
judge
those
words,
don't
we?

give

the
record
and
number
three
was,
if
the
judge
was
accused
of
being
unable
to
conduct
a
fair
and
impartial
trial,
what
is
the
--
what
basis
did
the
court
have
for
--
i
don't
see
any
words
like
that
in
the
motion?
justice
byron
r.

mr.
lee
how
come
did
he
[inaudible]
--
did
he
say
that
the
judge
is
prejudiced
against
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
did
-
when
did
that
intimidation
--
to
what
would
be
referring
--
justice
