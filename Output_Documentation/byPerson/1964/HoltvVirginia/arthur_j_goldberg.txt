justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
are
you
saying
in
effect
that
the
right
of
counsel
exists,
counsel
has
right
to
act
as
the
counsel,
is
that
about
it?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
here,
let's
take
this
case
which
is
certainly
not
the
case
at
bar
but
following
what
justice
black
had
said.
supposing
in
the
privacy
of
the
chambers,
the
judge
were
to
say
to
a
lawyer,
you
will
pay
me
a
$1,000,
i'll
decide
the
case
in
your
favor,
that's
about
the
worst
thing
i'm
sure
you'll
agree
with
me,
any
judge
could
do.
now
suppose
the
next
day
the
lawyer
filed
a
petition
for
disqualification
saying,
you
asked
for
a
bribe
and
therefore,
i
want
to
disqualify
you.
there
is
no
supporting
affidavit
because
there
is
no
disinterested
person
who
overheard
that
conversation.
would
you
not
say
it
would
be
a
denial
of
due
process
for
a
judge
summarily
to
hold
that
lawyer
in
contempt?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but,
you
say
this
is
not
this
type
of
case?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
will
you
explain
why
since
this
arose
out
of
a
conversation
in
chambers
as
i
understand
it,
where
the
lawyer
was
asked
about
some
witnesses
not
being
available
for
service
of
process.
as
i
understand
it,
that
was
the
basis
for
the
rule
to
show
cause.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
because
his
refusal
to
answer
the
question.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
how
does
that
differ
except
in
the
enormity
i
recognize
this?
now,
i
want
to
emphasize
in
what
i
have
said
has
no
relation
to
this
case?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
it's
a
hypothetical
case.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
mr.
lee,
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
was
the
--
the
part
to
get
this
record
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
let's
assume
that
the

comes
with
the
case
himself
and
part
of
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
mean
