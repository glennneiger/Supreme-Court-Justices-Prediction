l.

holt
et

petitioner,
versus
virginia.
mr.
karpatkin,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
mr.
karpatkin
that
there
was
no
hearing
even
to
determine
whether
these
statements
were
false?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lee.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lee,
what
allegations
in
the
pleadings
of
the
petitioners
here,
the
things
you
just
talked
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
they
not,
were
they
controverted
by
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
they
--
did
they
have
an
opportunity
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
that
proceeding
there
was
at
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
was
a
discussion
between
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
no
--
it
wasn't
the
proceeding
in
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
let
me
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
record
show
who
was
present
in
the
judge's
chambers
when
the
judge
who
was
interrogating
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright
then,
if
it
doesn't
indicate
who
was
present,
why
isn't
the
situation
exactly
like
the
hypothetical
that
mr.
justice
goldberg
just
stated?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
a
single
--
single
individual,
you
said
on
in
the
hypothetical
mr.
justice
goldberg
gave
you,
you
said
the
reason
that
that
case
should
be
differentiated
from
this
was
because
this
man
in
that
case
was
the
only
person
who
knew
that
fact,
because
he
and
the
judge
were
there
alone.
now
in
this
case,
you
say
that
the
record
does
not
show
who
was
there
and
i
suppose
we're
entitled
to
consider
that
just
the
two
of
them
were
and
why
would
it
be
different
in
that
respect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
want
to
know
where
it
is
in
the
record.
that's
all
i'm
interested
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
should
re-assume
who
was
there
for
the
purpose
of
making
affidavit
that
the
record
doesn't
show
anyone
was
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
karpatkin.
