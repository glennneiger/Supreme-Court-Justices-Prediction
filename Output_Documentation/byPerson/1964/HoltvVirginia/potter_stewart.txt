justice
potter
stewart
mr.
karpatkin,
this
--
this
was
a
motion
for
change
of
venue
rather
than
a
motion
to
disqualify
that
judge,
wasnâ€™t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
was
this
a
single
judge
court?
justice
potter
stewart
into
another
geographic
area?
justice
potter
stewart
could
there
been
a
motion
to,
as
to
disqualify
this
judge
to
sit
on
this
thing
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
not
subject
of
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
change
of
venue
was
made,
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
just
held
it
on
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
did
he
ever
rule
the
motion?
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
--
how
relevant
to
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
allegation?
this
was
a
motion
to
change
venue
and
i
suppose
in
order
to
support
such
a
motion
you
have
to
make
allegations
showing
why
or
how
in
the
opinion
of
the
moving
party
the
venue
ought
to
be
changed?
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
may
turn
out
to
be
untrue,
these
allegations,
but
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
the
issue
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
precisely.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there's
no
better
--
i
can't
think
of
any
better
ground
to
change
venues
in
that,
if
it
is
true?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
it's
never
been
a
hearing
as
to
the
truth
of
falsity
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
real
issue
isn't
it
in
whether
or
not
this
is
a
sufficient
basis
to
disqualify
a
judge
at
the
same
venue
--
