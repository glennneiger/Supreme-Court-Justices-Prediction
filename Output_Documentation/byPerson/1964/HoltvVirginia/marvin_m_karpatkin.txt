mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
this
afternoon,
because
two
practicing
attorneys
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
have
been
summarily
convicted
of
contempt
of
court
and
their
conviction
is
sustained
by
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
for
filing
and
arguing
a
legitimate
motion
for
a
change
of
venue.
although,
both
of
the
petitioners
are
attorneys,
messrs.
holt
and
dawley,
this
particular
motion
to
change
venue
was
made
in
the
proceeding
where
mr.
dawley
was
the
litigant
and
he
was
being
then
and
there
represented
by
his
law
partner,
mr.
holt
as
attorney.
it
is
our
principal
claim
that
since
this
motion
was
wholly
legitimate,
there
is
nothing
whatsoever
contemptuous
in
the
record
concerning
this
motion
to
change
the
venue.
that
these
contempt
convictions
are
deprivations
of
constitutional
rights
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
right
of
the
litigant
to
have
the
affective
assistance
of
counsel
and
of
the
right
of
the
attorney
to
vigorous
advocacy
in
his
client’s
cause,
in
both
cases
by
the
same
improper
judicial
act.
furthermore,
since
the
court
saw
fit
to
act
summarily,
without
resemblance
or
any
scintilla
of
a
hearing
with
just
no
hearing
at
all
and
since
this
was
not
one
of
those
special
situations
where
this
court
has
held,
summary
contempt
proceedings
are
constitutionally
permissible,
we
urge
that
this
was
a
further
and
separate
denial
of
due
process
of
law.
the
facts
maybe
stated
rather
briefly.
messrs.
dawley
and
holt
were
two
members
of
the
three-man-partnership
practicing
in
norfolk,
virginia
in
the
fall
of
1961.
litigation
pending
in
the
circuit
court
of
the
city
of
hopewell
involved
clients
of
the
firm,
the
case
of
hopewell
news
inc.
against
harris.
this
was
a
defamation
case.
the
defendants
were
represented
by
mr.
dawley
in
court.
there
was
an
allegation
in
the
record
that
the
purpose
of
this
defamation
case
was
to
destroy
an
organization
in
the
city
of
hopewell
called
“the
hopewell
improvement
association”,
an
organization
consisting
of
many
of
the
negro
citizens
of
the
city
of
hopewell
dedicated
to
--
efforts
to
bring
about
the
constitutional
requirement
of
racial
desegregation
in
accordance
with
law
and
in
accordance
with
decisions
of
this
court.
and
as
an
allegation
in
the
record,
that
the
purpose
of
this
lawsuit
brought
by
the
hopewell
news
alleged
in
the
record
to
be
the
only
newspaper
in
the
city
of
hopewell,
was
a
reflection
of
a
considerable
amount
of
community
tensions
and
hostility
extent
in
the
hopewell
area
at
that
time
where
there
were
an
effect
lined
up
on
the
side
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
hopewell
news
against
harris
litigation.
what
was
in
effect
the
pro-segregationist
power
structure
of
that
area
and
the
defendants
consisted
of
mr.
harris
and
others,
leading
members
of
the
negro
community,
officers
and
active
persons
in
the
hopewell
improvement
association
generally
represented
by
the
firm
of
jordan,
dawley,
and
holt
and
in
this
particular
defamation
case
represented
by
mr.
dawley.
in
any
event,
your
honors,
the
case
was
called
for
trial
on
october
05,
1961,
the
defamation
case
and
on
october
06,
1961,
a
dismissal
was
entered
on
the
record.
following
this
dismissal,
the
presiding
judge,
the
honorable
carlton
e.
holladay
subjected
mr.
dawley
to
a
series
of
questions,
which
either
were
not
answered
or
not
answered
to
the
judge’s
satisfaction.
i
believe
in
one
instance,
mr.
dawley
stated
he
wanted
some
time
to
consider
whether
he
should
answer
or
what
his
answer
should
be
and
this
led
somewhat
later
on
the
11th
of
december
1961,
to
judge
holladay
issuing
a
show
cause
order
directing
mr.
dawley
to
appear
in
show
cause
why
he
should
not
be
held
guilty
of
contempt
of
court
for
this
refusal
to
answer
judge
holladay’s
questions.
subsequently,
on
the
27th
of
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
questions
mr.
justice
harlan,
related
to
the
inability
of
the
bailiff
of
the
court
to
serve
process
on
some
of
the
defendants
who
were
mr.
dawley’s
clients.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
there
is
a
suggestion
but
the
record
is
hardly
clear
that
the
non-appearance
of
these
defendants,
who
were
called
as
witnesses
by
the
plaintiff,
had
something
to
do
with
the
dismissal
of
the
litigation,
but
it
is
not
clear
from
the
record
since
the
questioning
did
not
proceed
and
indeed
since
no
hearing
was
ever
granted
and
so
we
don’t
know
what
would
or
would
not
have
transpired
on
the
record,
had
these
questions
been
further
gone
into
the
hearing.
on
the
27th
of
december
1961,
mr.
dawley
filed
a
motion
to
disqualify
judge
holladay.
this
motion
was
filed
by
mr.
dawley
pro
se.
after
due
deliberation
on
the
28th
of
december,
the
motion
was
denied.
then
on
the
17th
of
january,
mr.
dawley
again
pro
se
filed
the
instant
venue
change
motion,
which
appears
in
the
record.
this
motion
came
on
for
hearing,
i
should
say,
your
honors
i'm
sorry,
the
contempt
trial
came
on
for
hearing
on
the
30th
of
january
1962.
at
that
time,
as
the
record
indicates,
mr.
dawley’s
appearance
was
as
a
litigant.
he
was
represented
by
his
partner
mr.
holt.
dawley
sat
silently
throughout
the
entire
proceedings
and
the
judge
asked
for
--
the
judge
stated
that
he
was
prepared
to
hear
argument,
prepared
to
consider
the
motion
for
change
of
venue,
which
as
i
stated
had
been
previously
filed
since
13
days
earlier.
and
the
record
indicates
that
mr.
holt
then
and
there
proceeded
to
read
into
the
record,
virtually
verbatim,
the
motion
which
has
been
previously
filed
--
the
written
motion,
which
had
been
previously
filed
by
mr.
dawley
pro
se.
immediately
upon
the
completion
of
this
reading,
the
judge
stated
that
he
held
this
motion
contemptuous
and
subsequently
certified
that
the
reasons
why
he
held
it
contemptuous
were
the
following
allegations
contained
in
the
motion,
and
these
are
contained
in
the
motion
as
filed
17
days
earlier
and
as
the
filed
motion
was
read
into
the
record,
i
beg
your
pardon,
13
days
earlier
as
read
into
the
record
13
days
later.
the
first
allegation
is
that
the
--
is
the
claim
that
there
was
a
judicial
amalgamation
of
functions.
the
precise
words
which
apparently
were
taken
very
--
which
apparently
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
as
well
as
the
commonwealth
in
its
brief
takes
great
umbrage
at
the
words
“is
now
in
effect
and/or
in
fact
acting
as
police
officer,
chief
prosecution
witness,
adverse
witness
for
the
defense,
grand
jury,
chief
prosecutor
and
judge.”
this
was
a
portion
of
the
allegation
on
the
motion
for
a
change
of
venue.
and
they
observed
parenthetically
that
these
words
seem
to
be
suggested
by
the
opinion
of
--
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
rutledge
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
‘in
re
oliver’
invalidating
the
michigan
one-man
grand
jury
statute.
the
second
allegation
in
the
venue
change
motion,
which
the
judge
considered
contemptuous
was
the
allegation
that
this
particular
judge
had
harassed
and
intimidated
mr.
holt,
the
attorney
appearing
for
mr.
dawley.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
record
--
there
were
occasions
when
holt
appeared
in
court,
your
honor.
however,
the
record
does
reflect
that
on
some
of
these
occasions
mr.
holt
stated
that
mr.
dawley
--
that
thus
far
mr.
dawley
was
appearing
pro
se.
however,
there
are
also
allegations
in
the
record
that
the
judge
stated
that
he
was
causing
an
investigation
to
be
made
of
the
activities
of
both
mr.
holt
and
mr.
dawley.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
don't
follow
your
honors
reference
to
paragraph
four.
which
paragraph
four
if
i
--?
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
only
thing
which
appears
in
the
record
mr.
justice
white,
is
on
page
13
of
the
record
that
part
of
the
harassment
and
intimidation
occurred
at
the
hearing
in
this
matter
on
january
08,
1962,
at
which
time
the
court
revealed
that
it
had
been
making
an
independent
investigation,
an
inquiry
of
mr.
holt's
conduct
and
of
the
contempt
offense.
the
judge
said
that
he
would
deal
with
leonard
holt
after
he
had
dealt
with
the
e.
a.
dawley.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that's
my
understanding,
your
honor.
the
final
allegation
in
the
venue
change
motion,
which
the
judge
found
contemptuous,
was
the
allegation
that
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
could
not
be
had
in
the
hopewell
circuit
court
under
the
circumstances
then
existing.
subsequent
to
the
finding
of
contempt,
an
apology
was
tendered,
about
which
i'll
have
some
more
to
say
later,
which
was
in
effect,
we
urge
a
disclaimer
of
any
intentional
disrespect
for
the
court,
a
statement
in
effect
that
we
say
what
we
have
to
say
in
order
to
do
our
job
as
attorneys
and
produce
the
legal
effect
of
a
venue
change
motion,
but
that
no
respect
was
subjectively
intended.
in
any
event,
after
sentence,
the
--
both
contempt
convictions
were
unanimously
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
and
this
court
granted
certiorari.
we
urge
in
the
first
instances,
in
the
first
instance
that,
this
is
a
denial
of
rights
under
the
due
process
clause,
because
in
as
much
as
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
counsel,
sustained
by
this
court
over
and
over
again
and
which
the
bar
has
admonished
continually
by
the
cannons
of
ethics
of
the
american
bar
association
and
that
this
right
to
counsel
includes
the
attorneys
right
of
advocacy,
indeed
the
attorneys
duty
of
advocacy
as
well
as
the
client’s
right
to
have
zealous
representation.
that
since
there
was
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
this
motion,
since
this
motion
was
perfectly
legitimate
and
met
all
of
the
criteria
of
legitimacy,
that
to
label
it
‘a
contempt’
to
poll
that
there
is
sanction
worthy
conduct
in
a
legitimate
motion
of
this
nature
is
a
denial
of
constitutional
rights,
a
denial
of
the
right
of
effective
counsel.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that's
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
believe
mr.
justice
stewart
that
there
are
other
judges
sitting
in
that
circuit,
but
i
believe
that
the
allegation
--
some
of
the
allegations
in
the
record
indicated
desire
to
move
the
proceedings
completely
out
of
this
physical
area.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
into
another
geographical
area
and
there
are
allegations
in
the
record
indicating
that
other
court
officers
are
involved
that
the
clerk
of
the
court
and
that
the
commonwealth
attorney
have
likewise
been
involved.
allegations
in
the
record
that
police
officers
have
visited
some
of
the
clients
of
these
attorneys
and
have
harassed
them
and
have
told
them
that
they
--
and
have
threatened
them
with
all
kinds
of
dire
predictions
of
conduct
--
of
bad
conduct
in
the
event
they
would
continue
to
be
represented
by
these
attorneys.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
your
honor,
such
a
motion
was
made
and
denied.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
no,
your
honor,
it's
not.
that
motion
had
previously
been
made
and
denied,
following
that
this
motion
for
change
of
venue.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
and
nor
is
that
the
subject
to
this
case,
if
i
may
respectfully
suggest.
the
subject
to
this
case
that
the
judge
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
--
instead
of
hearing
that
motion
on
the
merits,
instead
of
calling
a
hearing
or
instead
of
saying
at
the
very
least,
“show
cause
why
i
should
not
hold
you
for
contempt.
i
think
this
is
contemptuous
what
you
have
to
say
that
it
is
not”.
rather
than
that
he
just
said
flatly
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
--contempt,
that's
it.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
motion
for
venue
was
denied
immediately
thereafter
your
honor.
and
we
suggest,
if
i
may
state
it,
your
question,
your
honor,
where
i
intended
that,
when
you
make
a
motion
for
a
change
of
venue
or
a
motion
to
disqualify
a
judge,
and
before
the
judge
rules
on
it,
his
immediate
reaction
is,
if
i
might
quote
some
language
of
this
court,
i
believe
in
ungar
against
sarafite,
if
–
it's
immediate
reflex
reaction,
what
you
did
is
contemptuous?
it
foreshadows
or
inevitably
foreshadows
that
there's
going
to
be
less
than
a
full
fair
and
constitutional
determination
of
the
merits
of
the
underlying
motion.
it
is
our
position
that
this
motion
was
perfectly
legitimate,
perfectly
permissible
since
it
met
all
of
the
established
criteria.
unfortunately,
other
than
the
reference
to
the
case
of
‘in
re
oliver’,
we
have
not
been
able
to
find
many
cases
establishing
the
criteria
of
legitimacy
into
decisions
of
this
court.
we
have
therefore
turned
to
a
survey
of
the
decisions
of
state
courts
throughout
the
country
finding
what
is
and
what
is
not
considered
legitimate.
what
is
and
what
is
not
considered
proper
conduct
by
an
attorney
in
making
this
kind
of
a
motion
and
it
is
our
conclusion
from
a
distillation
of
this
cases
that,
this
motion
was
perfectly
legitimate,
because
it
met
what
appeared
to
be
the
three
established
standards
of
fairness,
which
show
up
from
a
survey
of
all
of
these
cases.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
time
of
recess
yesterday
afternoon,
i
believe
i
had
started
my
discussion
of
the
three
criteria
of
legitimacy
which
we
feel
is
established
by
a
survey
of
relevant
decisions
of
state
courts
throughout
the
country
for
determining
whether
a
venue
change
motion
or
a
motion
for
judicial
disqualification
can
be
held
to
be
contemptuous
on
the
one
hand
or
whether
it
is
perfectly
legitimate
on
the
other.
these
criteria
elaborated
in
our
brief
are
that
such
a
motion
must
be
relevant,
its
contents
must
be
relevant,
it
must
be
presented
in
good
faith,
and
it
must
be
presented
in
respectful
language
and
in
a
respectful
manner.
we
urge
that
the
record
indicates
that
all
of
these
criteria
were
amply
met.
it
appears
that
the
virginia
supreme
court
gave
some
attention
to
some
of
these
criteria.
they
seem
to
agree
that
relevancy
or
as
they
put
it
pertinence
is
important,
but
they
conclude
that
this
criteria
was
not
met.
without
elaboration,
we
suggest
that
the
material
we
have
set
forth
in
the
--
the
material
set
forth
in
the
record
digested
in
our
brief
on
page
14
and
15,
amply
demonstrates,
establishes
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt
that
the
contents
of
this
motion
were
relevant
to
the
relief
being
sought.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
constitutional
claim,
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
that
a
lawyer
was
doing
his
job
as
he
thought
it
was
his
job
to
do.
he
made
a
motion
to
change
venue
for
the
benefit
of
his
client.
the
court
regarded
this
motion
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
was
perfectly
legitimate
as
contemptuous.
holding
both
the
maker
of
the
motion
on
the
party
in
whose
behalf
it
was
made
to
the
in
contempt
is
a
denial
of
the
due
process
rights
of
representation
of
counsel.
we
have
a
second
claim
also
which
i'll
come
into
in
a
minute
that
the
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that
the
denial
of
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
mr.
justice
harlan.
that
it
was
--
just
as
much
as
it
would
be
a
denial
of
due
process
under
any
other
aspect
of
denial
of
effective
representation
of
counsel.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
there's
no
evidence
to
support
the
--
that
the
--
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
harlan.
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
the
contempt
proceeding
and
holding
this
to
be
contemptuous
is
as
much
a
denial
of
representation
of
counsel
as
if
there
was
insufficient
time
to
consult
or
counsel
was
totally
incompetent
or
any
of
the
other
areas
in
which
this
court
has
so
decided
that
doctrine.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
no,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
is
our
position.
i
did
not
understand
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
it
seems
to
me
that
where
an
attorney
is
frustrated
as
you
put
it,
your
honor,
in
his
efforts
to
make
a
good
faith
motion,
a
legitimate
motion,
a
motion
which
it
is
evident
from
the
record
is
legitimate
that
this
is
as
much
a
denial
of
counsel
as
if
that
attorney?s
mouth
was
bound
and
he
could
say
nothing.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
insofar
as
the
attorney
is
frustrated
from
presenting
those
contentions
in
that
area,
we
respectfully
content
it
is
--
it
is
a
denial
of
counsel.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that
is,
it
puts
in
a
nutshell
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
way
we
read
the
cases
mr.
justice
brennan,
these
are
co-relative
rights.
that
the
--
whatever
right
the
client
has
to
have
an
effective
diligence
zealous
advocate,
the
lawyer's
calling
--
the
lawyer's
professional
responsibility
gives
him
the
co-relative
right
to
advocate
to
the
best
of
his
ability.
i
believe
that
some
decisions
have
referred
to
this
as
the
lawyer's
right
of
free
speech,
the
lawyer's
right
of
advocacy.
and
limiting
him
in
this
way,
it
seems
to
me,
is
in
constitutional
effect
no
different
that
the
limitation
upon
lawyers
imposed
by
some
devious
regulatory
scheme
which
this
court
has
found
to
be
a
violation
of
constitutional
right.
the
--
with
respect
to
the
second
and
third
criteria
of
good
faith
and
of
respect,
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
made
holdings
which
we
think
are
completely
at
variance
with
the
record.
the
virginia
supreme
court
states
that
the
absence
of
a
compulsory
disqualification
statute
itself
amounts
to
bad
faith.
now,
this
seems
to
us
to
be
almost
a
classical
non-sequitur,
because
it's
stating
that
a
mistaken
law
amounts
to
bad
faith
which
of
course
is
something
which
is
(inaudible)
and
not
so.
conceivably
the
defendants
may
have
been
wrong.
we
will
never
know
because
there
was
not
a
hearing
or
at
least
we
do
not
know
at
this
point,
but
certainly
the
charge
that
they
are
on
in
bad
faith
is
something
which
is
completely
unsupported.
similarly
with
regard
to
the
element
of
respect,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
indicates
that
anything
transpired
on
this
proceeding
before
judge
holladay
other
than
the
reading
of
the
motion
which
had
been
previously
filed.
no
holdings
with
regard
to
demeanor
or
with
regard
to
attitude
or
tone
of
voice
or
anything
like
that.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that
question
very
much
exists
and
we
think
that
it
was
incorrectly
characterized
by
the
trial
court
and
by
the
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
believe
that
--
that
is
absolutely
correct
mr.
justice
white.
that
this
court
must
read
these
words
that
these
words
are
constitutional
words,
that
these
are
constitutional
facts
which
have
to
be
determined
and
that
we
can
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
we
believe
that
sacher
and
the
cases
of
--
in
other
cases
cited
by
the
supreme
court
and
the
learned
attorney
general's
brief
have
absolutely
no
bearing.
they
go
to
the
second
point
of
our
claim
of
denial
of
due
process
that
the
court
improperly
proceeded
summarily.
in
sacher
and
in
fisher
against
pace,
and
in
natori
case,
there
were
aggravated
situations
involving
persistent
obvious
flagrant
disobedience
to
the
court.
i
believe
in
the
natori
case
an
attorney
physically
assaulted
a
united
states
marshall
and
in
the
fisher
against
pace
and
in
the
sacher
case,
there
was
persistence
by
counsel
after
continued
admonition
by
the
court.
nothing
of
that
kind
happened
here.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
would
agree
that
if
something
the
--
if
something
to
the
effect
of
terry
happened
in
this
case,
this
conviction
should
stand.
i
don't
think
that
my
argument
has
to
go
any
further
than
that
at
this
point,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that
is
absolutely
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
the
immediate
response,
almost
a
reflex
response
in
the
part
of
the
court
was
to
state,
i
think
this
is
contemptuous
and
both
the
--
both
dawley
and
holt
are
held
in
contempt
and
he
said
that
he
will
impose
sentence
later
that
afternoon.
no
hearing,
no
opportunity
to
make
explanation
of
any
kind.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
sentence
was
at
--
it
were
$50
fines
for
both
of
the
litigants,
both
of
the
contenders,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
record
is
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
record
does
not
so
indicate
mr.
justice
brennan.
however,
we
do
indicate
in
our
brief
that
these
are
not
the
only
involvements
which
these
two
petitioners
have
had
with
the
authorities
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia,
which
they
respectfully
urge
arise
from
their
activities
in
pursuit
of
constitutional
rights
in
behalf
of
their
clients
in
many
instances
clients
in
civil
right
cases.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
there
are
claims
of
that
made
in
the
record
your
honor,
but
again
there
was
no
hearing.
there
are
claims
that
were
made
in
the
motion
for
a
change
of
venue
and
there
are
other
proceedings
of
which
these
petitioners
had
been
the
subject
including
legislative
investigations
in
the
part
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
but
again,
no
hearing
was
afforded
and
consequently,
we
have
no
indication
as
to
the
extent
of
which
there
is
evidence.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that
is
our
position
mr.
justice
brennan.
we
feel
that
this
is
one
of
those
cases
where
even
the
grant
of
a
hearing
would
not
be
sufficient,
because
the
hearing
before
the
same
judge
would
be
a
hearing
before
a
judge
who
has
an
interest
in
establishing
his
own
impartiality,
who
has
an
interest
in
establishing
that
he
is
not
disinterested.
and,
we
feel
that
this
is
one
of
those
cases
and
i
recognize
that
this
court
has
thus
far
not
so
held,
we
think
this
might
be
an
appropriate
case
for
it
to
go
a
bit
further
than
it
has
gone
in
previous
cases
and
to
suggest
that
where
the
contempt
proceeding
arises
from
that
which
is
in
law,
an
attack
on
the
legal
capacity
of
the
judge.
a
motion
for
judicial
disqualification
of
the
change
venue
that
at
least
in
that
kind
of
a
case,
a
hearing
before
the
same
judge
would
not
be
sufficient,
but
it
should
be
a
hearing
before
a
different
judge.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
accept
this
court's
decision
in
the
barnett
case
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i'm
not
either
and
we
don't
make
that
claim
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i'd
like
to
save
my
remaining
time
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
assume
that
the
reference
here
is
to
the
judge's
certification
or
to
the
statement
in
the
record
that
the
statement
in
the
motion
which
appears
on
page
14
of
the
record
mr.
justice
white,
that
e.
a.
dawley
cannot
get
a
fair
trial
on
the
city
of
hopewell,
virginia.
if
i
have
any
remaining
time
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
save
it
for
rebuttal.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
observe
very
quickly
that
as
i
read
the
decision
of
the
virginia
supreme
court,
it
seems
that
they
are
suggesting
that
any
venue
change
motion
is
automatically
a
suspect
and
that
the
only
possible
explanation
which
could
have
been
given
by
way
of
disclaimer
of
intentional
disrespect
would
have
been
to
withdraw
the
motion.
and,
of
course,
this
could
not
be
done
because
the
motion
--
if
the
motion
had
a
serious
purpose
and
was
seriously
intended.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
essence
of
this
case
is
that
it's
one
thing
to
deny
a
motion
after
giving
it
fair
consideration,
lengthy
or
brief
as
the
case
maybe.
it's
quite
another
thing
to
state
that
the
reaction
to
this
motion
is
that
the
motion
is
contemptuous
and
that
its
makers
are
subjected
to
criminal
sanctions.
and
that's
exactly
which
has
happened
here
and
i
believe
that
it
is
established
indeed
by
the
cases
cited
by
the
learned
attorney
general
in
his
brief
on
page
17,
which
presumed
to
indicate
that
the
virginia
law
requires
the
affidavits
of
disinterested
witnesses.
first
as
i
read
these
cases,
i
don't
find
that
to
be
exactly
so.
i
think
that
the
virginia
law
requires
that
there
be
preponderance
of
evidence
to
establish
it
one
way
or
another,
affidavits
being
only
one
way.
but
what
is
significant
is
that
in
all
of
these
cases,
the
motions
were
denied
but
there
were
no
contempt
proceedings.
it
was
not
considered
to
be
contemptuous
and
in
the
first
of
these
cited
cases,
the
judge
was
accused
of
personal
prejudice.
the
judge's
brother
was
accused
of
being
personally
involved
in
the
litigation,
but
simply
the
motion
was
considered,
the
motion
was
denied,
it
was
not
contemptuous.
may
it
please
the
court,
my
learned
friend
has
stated
in
his
eloquent
brief
that
certainly
because
this
petition
is
alleged
to
be
civil
rights
lawyers
representing
negro
clients
in
pursuit
of
civil
rights
objectives,
they're
not
entitled
to
anymore
rights.
we
certainly
agree,
but
by
the
same
token,
they're
not
entitled
to
any
less.
thank
you
very
much.
