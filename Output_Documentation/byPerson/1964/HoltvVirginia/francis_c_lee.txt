mr.
francis
c.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
gentlemen
of
the
court.
if
it
pleases
the
court,
i
think
we
might
state
at
the
very
threshold
that
contempt
proceedings
is
always
on
us
and
unpleasant
and
in
a
case
of
this
nature
it's
doubly
so
over
concern
with
fellow
members
of
the
bar
of
all
family,
and
we
treading
on
that
very
narrow
delicate
ground
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
referred
to
in
his
opinion
in
the
sacher
case,
but
we've
got
to
balance
these
rights,
freedom
of
speech,
the
rights
of
advocacy
against
the
maintenance
of
decorum
and
dignity
of
the
court.
now
in
order
to
set
this
case
in
its
proper
setting
and
to
bring
it
into
focus,
i
think
we
should
review
the
background
as
demonstrated
in
the
record
and
not
by
my
speculation
as
to
what
happened
outside
of
the
record,
well
i
think
we
are
confined
to
the
facts
as
demonstrated
in
this
record.
now
all
of
these
allegations
and
speculations
and
now
i'm
very
to
happy
to
hear
counsel
say
that
there
were
allegations
in
the
record
because
that's
what
they
are,
allegations
of
these
petitioners'
participation
in
civil
rights
cases
and
the
bias
and
the
prejudice
ad
which
they
have
made
in
virginia,
all
of
these
speculations
on
the
part
of
counsel
and
these
petitioners,
and
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
indicate
that
that
is
the
case
in
virginia
or
hopewell
either.
this
case
arose
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
yes,
sir.
these
allegations
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
no,
sir.
they
have
not
been
controverted
because
they
have
not
been
put
before
the
court
yet.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
that
was
not
an
issue
at
that
time
mr.
chief
justice
and
that
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
--
that
was
not
an
issue
at
the
time.
let
me
give
you
the
background
of
the
setting,
if
i
may?
mr.
francis
c.
lee
the
case
in
which
this
particular
contempt
arose,
now
i
think
we
have
to
separate
the
two
and
keep
them
entirely
separately
apart,
the
case
in
which
this
particular
contempt
arose
was
in
the
proceeding
which
was
a
non-summary
proceeding
against
mr.
dawley.
mr.
dawley
had
represented
an
organization
in
and
about
the
hopewell
area
which
had
been
sued
by
hopewell
newspapers
for
a
slander
charge
in
which
they
brought
a
civil
action.
after
two
days
of
attempting
to
get
process
served
on
the
defendants
in
that
action,
subpoenas
had
been
issued
on
october
the
5th
and
6th
of
1961,
attempting
to
serve,
they
could
find
none
of
the
defendants.
so
on
the
6th
of
october,
the
case
was
to
be
settled.
it
was
agreed
between
counsels
that
it
were
to
be
settled.
during
these
times
of
settlement
in
the
courtroom,
the
principal
defendant
showed
up
at
counsel
table.
this
became
apparently
suspicious
to
the
judge,
judge
holladay,
and
so
after
the
case
was
all
over,
he
called
mr.
dawley
back
into
his
chambers
to
inquire
if
he
knew
anything
about
the
difficulty
in
these
people
being
found
these
12
defendants.
mr.
dawley
refused
to
answer
the
questions.
he
was
asked
three
times.
he
refused
to
answer
and
at
one
one
instance
he
said,
?i'd
like
to
have
some
time
to
consider.?
so,
the
judge
said,
?well,
you
come
back
here
on
october
the
10th
then.?
mr.
francis
c.
lee
that
was
--
that
was
after
the
case
was
all
over.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
that
was
after
the
civil
case
was
settled.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
that
was
a
discussion
between
the
judge
and
mr.
dawley.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
nothing
in
the
proceeding
at
that
time.
we
simply
asked
the
lawyer,
if
he
knew
anything
about
the
process
of
the
court
then
thought
it.
the
counsel
refused
to
answer
on
the
ground,
he
wants
to
take
time
to
consider.
the
court
gave
him
time
to
consider
and
he
came
back
on
october
the
10th
or
11th,
it's
not
quite
clear
which
of
those
dates
he
came
back.
at
that
time,
he
was
represented.
so
it
indicates
in
the
record
by
mr.
holt.
mr.
holt,
at
that
time,
asked
for
a
time
to
consider
again
or
to
take
time
to
be
heard.
thereafter,
the
court
issued
a
rule,
setting
this
case
for
january
the
8th.
now,
there
were
a
lot
of
proceedings
that
took
place
in
the
meantime,
because
its
counsel
immediately
went
to
work
to
try
to
get
out
of
this
court.
in
other
words,
they
didn't
want
the
show
cause
order
return
to
this
court.
so
on
december
11th
then,
you
had
the
date
set
for
mr.
dawley
to
answer.
mr.
holt
appeared,
but
at
that
time
the
court
asked
him
if
he
represented
mr.
dawley
and
mr.
holt
said,
he
did
not.
now,
i
think
we
should
bear
in
this
mind,
it
was
december
11th
that
mr.
holt
said
he
did
not
represent
mr.
dawley.
now,
bring
this
over
then
into
the
latter
part
of
december
when
mr.
dawley
appeared
before
the
district
court.
he
was
still
at
the
same
time
trying
to
get
the
judge
disqualify
himself
and
made
this
motion
that
was
indeed
december
27th.
the
court
overruled
that
motion
on
december
28th,
refused
to
disqualify
himself
in
this
non-summary
proceeding,
in
other
words,
to
hear
the
show
cause
on
mr.
dawley's
part.
now,
on
january
the
8th
and
this
was
the
date
in
which
they
were
originally
scheduled
to
appear,
there
is
apparently,
some
dispute
in
the
record
as
to
where
he
did
appear
or
did
not
appear.
in
the
federal
district
court,
he
said
that
he
did
appear.
he
was
served
and
did
appear,
but
in
the
transcript
of
the
record,
in
which
he
presented
for
this
court
or
for
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia,
he
said,
he
was
not
served
with
the
notice
and
therefore
he
did
not
appear.
now
on
january
the
17th,
he
filed
this
motion
as
mr.
dawley
pro
se
filed
in
that
non-summary
contempt
action,
a
motion
to
change
the
venue
and
this
is
the
basis
for
the
contempt
which
is
appearing
here
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
dawley
filed
this
motion
to
which
he
attached
an
affidavit,
in
which
he
made
some
very,
very
serious
allegations.
and
i
don't
believe
in
any
court,
whether
in
the
federal
court
or
whether
in
the
state
courts,
this
court
could
say
that
that
was
a
legitimate
motion
or
to
change
the
venue.
i
just
don't
believe
this
court
has
ever
said
that
and
intends
to
say
that.
all
you
have
to
do
to
see
what
type
of
motion
was
filed
in
this
case
as
to
see
what
mr.
holt
read
into
the
record
when
he
appeared
there
on
the
30th
at
which
time
he
said
he
then
represented
mr.
dawley.
now,
throughout
this
affidavit
and
this
motion
that
was
read
into
the
record
by
the
mr.
holt,
i
think
you
will
see
that
what
he
was
attempting
to
do
in
making
these
wild
allegations
and
supported
by
any
non-interested
witness,
but
wild
allegations
of
his
own
that
not
only
was
the
territory
of
hopewell,
virginia
inflamed
against
the
negro
race
and
mr.
dawley,
generally
and
specifically,
but
so
was
the
judge
and
so
was
the
member
or
the
clerk,
and
so
was
all
--
so
were
all
the
other
officials
of
the
court.
they
were
prejudiced
against
him.
now
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
starting
on
page
13
of
the
transcript
of
the
record,
these
are
--
this
is
in
paragraph
lettered
l,
in
which
he
after
reading
or
stating
all
the
events
that
led
up
to
this
in
his
opinion.
he
then
stated
that
certain
elements
--
reaction
that
forces
in
the
hopewell
community
was
frustrated
because
of
this
dismissal
of
the
civil
action.
then
he
said
that
the
said
honorable
judge
carlton
e.
holladay,
who
presided
in
the
libel
suit
and
who
now
fails
and
refused
it
to
disqualify
himself
as
judge
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
in
the
contempt
trial
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
i'm
reading
from
the
middle
of
page
13
of
the
record.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
?
in
which
he
refuses
disqualify
himself
as
judge
in
the
contempt
trial
of
the
defendant
e.
a.
dawley,
jr.,
has
with
respect
to
say
contempt
action
and
he
is
now
in
effect
and
in
all,
in
fact,
acting
in
the
capacity
of
police
officer,
chief
prosecution
witness,
adverse
witness
for
the
defense,
grand
jury,
chief
prosecutor,
and
judge
that
in
addition
to
the
foregone
that
said
judge
carlton
e.
holladay
did
intimidate
and
harassed
the
lawyer
representing
e.
a.
dawley,
leonard
w.
holt,
esquire.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
he
more
specifically
refers
to
the
intimidation,
later
on
which
he
says
in
specifically,
in
that
part
later
on
in
that
allegation
--
that
part
of
the
harassment
and
intimidation
occurred
at
the
hearing
in
this
matter
on
january
8,
1962.
now,
i
draw
attention
to
the
fact
again
that
mr.
holt
did
not
represent
mr.
dawley
on
january
8,
1962
for
on
december
11th,
he
expressly
stated
he
did
not
represent
mr.
dawley
and
it
wasn't
until
january
30
again
that
he
did
represent
mr.
dawley.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
that
is
unclear
i
believe
he
was
present
in
court,
however.
the
transcript
of
the
record
indicates
that
mr.
holt
was
present
and
asked
for
continuance
--
mr.
dawley
asked
for
a
continuance.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
confusion
in
there
as
exactly
who
was
representing
whom
at
that
particular
time.
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record,
nothing
that
indicates
that
mr.
dawley
or
mr.
holt
was
at
any
time
intimidated
or
harassed
by
the
trial
court.
this
is
pure
speculation
on
the
part
of
the
petitioners
and
i
caution
you
again,
there's
nothing
in
that
to
indicate,
not
a
whisper.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
simply
this
that
this
laid
the
ground
work
for
the
attack,
personal
attack
on
the
judge.
it's
saying
that
first
of
all,
the
community
has
prejudiced
against
them.
they
can't
receive
a
fair
trial
in
community.
that
standing
alone
maybe
a
good
ground
in
just
cause
to
change
in
venue.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
the
question
is
where
would
you
change
the
venue
to?
so,
then
it
comes
down
to
whether
or
not
the
judge
himself
should
be
disqualified,
whether
or
not
you
can
move
it
over
into
the
next
county
and
still
have
the
same
judge
or
whether
not
it
is
necessary
to
disqualify
both,
the
venue
as
well
as
the
judge
and
so,
they
made
a
personal
attack
on
the
judge.
they
had
already
made
this
attack
in
their
motion
for
disqualifying
and
had
been
overruled.
the
motion
to
?
retried
with
jury
was
still
pending.
i
think
we
can
just
discount
that
because
that
is
not
before
the
court,
that
was
still
pending
and
has
not
yet
been
passed
on.
and
so,
this
became
pertinent
only
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
a
legitimate
just
cause
for
a
change
in
venue.
in
other
words,
can
you
plead
anything
you
like
to
plead
when
you
say,
?i
think
i
should
be
tried
in
another
venue??
and
we
submit
that
couple
this,
this
language,
later
on
with
the
other
language
before
the
court
in
the
same
motion
or
in
the
same
affidavit
or
as
was
argued
by
counsel,
leaves
no
question
but
what
it
was
contemptuous,
because
it
was
a
personal
attack
upon
the
integrity
of
the
court.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
maybe
an
excellent
ground
for
changing
venue.
it
maybe
an
excellent
ground
for
changing
the
judge
in
disqualification,
but,
i
think
we
are
treading
a
very,
very
delicate
line
here.
this
court
has
indicated
all
along
that
you
can
use
forceful
argument.
you
can
use
any
source
at
your
command
to
protect
your
client's
interest
but
you,
at
the
same
time,
must
remember
that
the
court's
dignity
must
be
observed,
that
you
must
keep
proper
decorum
in
that
court.
you
can't
go
wildly
off
into
wild
allegation
that
are
baseless
as
to
the
judge's
disqualification
causes
or
he
is
subpoenaed
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
no
sir,
they
haven't
and
our
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
years
and
years
ago,
if
you
are
going
to
attack
the
court
as
basis
for
disqualification
or
changing
venues,
you
must
have
affidavits
to
support
that
motion
from
disinterested
witnesses.
there's
nothing
here
to
indicate
that
this
was
factual,
nothing
at
all.
now,
i
simply
must
admonish
here
at
this
point,
if
this
is
the
basis
--
if
this
is
the
basis
for
disqualifying
and
the
constitutional
basis,
i
remind
you,
for
disqualifying
of
a
change
in
venue,
then
you
can
disqualify
a
judge
in
any
case
simply
by
following
this
practice
here
and
i
don't
believe
this
court
is
ready
to
say
that,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
the
issue
here
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
precisely
so.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
i
think
that
is
the
issue.
i
think
that
is
the
issue
before
the
court
and
all
the
other
little
issues
will
fall
in
line
based
on
the
former
opinions
of
this
court
once
you
decide
that.
so,
having
not
expressly
stated,
how
far
you
may
go
in
filing
a
motion
before
a
court
and
the
type
of
language
that
you
may
use
in
that
and
the
allegations
which
maybe
or
may
not
be
baseless
in
that
motion
then
i
think
we
must
refer
to
what
other
courts
have
said.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
sure.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
that
was
in
a
non-summary
proceeding.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
it's
still
open.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
yes,
sir.
that
is
still
pending
down
now
in
this
other
court.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
that's
the
only
against
mr.
dawley.
this
particular
contempt
--
the
summary
contempt
at
this
particular
time,
january
30,
1962,
stayed
all
other
proceedings.
so
everything
has
been
held
in
limbo
awaiting
this
decision.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
i
certainly
would
sir.
in
the
language
that
is
used--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
i
would,
sir.
in
the
language
that
is
used
here,
i
certainly
would.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
i
think
that
is
true,
sir.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
by
the
language
in
which
he
used
is
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
no,
sir.
i
don't
mind
the
least
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
on
page
13
and
i
think
we
have
to
couple
this
with
the
other
language.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
on
page
13
in
the
middle
of
the
page.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
yes,
sir.
i
surely
will.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
that
the
said
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
all
right,
sir.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
alright.
the
first
part
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
-?
is
that
judge
carlton
e.
holladay,
who
presided
in
the
libel
suit
and
who
now
failed
and
refuses
to
disqualify
himself
as
judge
in
the
contempt
trial
of
the
defendant
so
far,
had
with
respect
to
said
contempt
action
and
is
now
in
effect
or
in
fact,
acting
in
the
capacity
of
a
police
officer,
chief
prosecution
witness,
adverse
witness
for
a
defense,
grand
jury,
chief
prosecuting
judge,
and
i
stop
there,
that's
part
of.
the
next
part
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
the
whole
part
in
which
he
accused
a
judge
of
acting
as
a
chief
prosecutor
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
it's
the
manner
in
which
you
accuse
a
judge
of
doing
something,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
yes,
sir.
that
is
very
true.
i'll
grant
you
this
in
very
straight
plain
language,
because
i
believe
they
picked
it
up
from
an
opinion
of
this
court
in
which
you
were
hammering
away
at
the
in
camera
proceeding
in
the
state
of
michigan
in
which
the
judge
acts
as
a
grand
jury
by
statute
and
takes
them
into
the
back
room
and
acts
as
grand
jury
in
which
he
is
the
prosecutor
and
the
judge
and
everything
else
concerned
and
combined.
and
then
later
on,
as
you
said
an
alibi
also
emerges
from
that
same
judge
cannot
try
the
man
for
contempt
that
happened
back
then
in
camera.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
the
other
language
indicates
as
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
the
language
alone
following
that
is
that
the
said
judge
--
judge
carlton
holladay
did
intimidate
and
harass
the
lawyer
representing
e.
a.
dawley
and
leonard
w,
holt,
esquire,
the
effect
of
which
is
to
seriously
hamper
the
efforts
of
said
leonard
w.
holt
in
defendant
said,
e.
a.
dawley
that
said,
harassment
and
intimidation
arises
out
off
is
connected
solely
with
leonard
holt,
for
this
place
and
intent
of
being
held
in
contempt
actions.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
if
it
were
buttressed,
you
said
he
could
prove
it
--
if
this
buttressed
by
affidavit's
from
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
he
has
to
allege,
but
he
also
under
virginia
construction
of
our
statute
must
buttress
with
affidavits
from
this
said
witness
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
no,
sir.
he
wasn't.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
no,
sir,
i
don't
rely
on
that.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
i
would
sustain
it
if
that
he
would
say
what
he
said
subsequently
on
page
16,
in
which
the
judge
is
inquired
of
him
about
the
motion
that
he
filed.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
on
page
16
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
that's
the
language
that
he
used
--
mr.
holt
said
to
the
court
when
he
said
that
he
could
not
get
a
fair
trial
in
that
circuit.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
i
think
they
are
and
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
like
to
draw
your
attention
on
what
you
said
not
you
personally,
but
what
this
court
said,
in
one
of
first
cases
to
come
here
in
which
you
refused
the
summary
and
the
non-summary
contempt
in
your
cook
case.
well,
then
in
my
opinion
was
a
very
mild
admonition
of
the
judge
by
one
of
the
lawyers.
he
wrote
in
the
letter
and
asking
me
to
disqualify
himself
and
then,
very,
very
mild
language,
in
my
opinion,
much
milder
when
compared
to
this,
said
that,
?i
think
you
should
disqualify
yourself
because
i
had
thought
that
you
were
a
big
enough
man
to
overcome
your
prejudice
in
the
case.
but
i
find
now
after
deciding
this
case
today,
you
are
not.
and
therefore,
i
would
like
you
to
disqualify
yourself??
and
this
court
said,
?that's
--
that's
contempt.?
you
said,
we
agree
with
the
circuit
court
that
that
was
contentious,
but
he
should
have
disqualified
himself
under
the
rules
of
this
court.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
i
will
agree
with
that.
i
think
--
i
think
it
would
be
quite
questionable.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
pass
on
it,
but
i
think
that
would
be
quite
questionable.
well,
i
think
if
had
he
followed
the
orderly
course
of
representing
the
client.
i
don't
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
yes.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
if
the
judge
in
this
case
had
that
issue
before
him,
buttressed
by
the
affidavit
that's
contemplated
by
virginia
statute
as
interpreted
by
our
own
court
then,
i
think
you
would
have
a
justiciable
question
before
it.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
no,
sir.
i
would
not
say
that
in
this
case
[voice
overlap]
mr.
francis
c.
lee
[voice
overlap]
case
you
give
me.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
no,
sir.
in
time,
i'm
inclined
to
doubt
that
mr.
justice
black,
as
i
say,
i
don't
have
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
i
don't
think
it
due
process
at
all
would
have
denied
it.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
the
federal
law
doesn't
apply
to
this.
of
course,
the
due
process
clause,
everyone
is
entitled
to
due
process.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
we've
denied
the
due
process
here,
the
only
question
before
this
court.
i
don't
admit
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
i'm
inclined
to
think
they
would
infringe,
i
retrace
my
steps.
i'm
inclined
to
think
they
would
get
off
the
close,
but
as
i
say
i
would
hate
to
put
myself
in
the
position
of
saying
that
now
because
we
never
had
to
pass
on
that
question
yet.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
mr.
justice
goldberg,
we're
getting
awfully
close
there,
i
grant
you,
i
grant
you
without
a
hearing,
because
there
you
are
presenting
a
justiciable
question
perhaps.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
you're
presenting
an
allegation
there
in
which
this
person
is
the
only
one
that
would
have
any
knowledge
on
it.
therefore,
you
should
present
a
justiciable
question
for
someone
to
decide.
i'm
inclined
to
agree
with
you
now.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
i
certainly
do.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
that's
correct.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
i
understand.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
the
case
differs
in
this
respect
sir.
and
in
that
case,
you
had
a
judge
being
attacked
by
a
member
of
bar
as
to
what
happened
in
chambers
in
which
there
are
only
two
people
in
the
world,
they
would
know
about
what
really
happened
in
chambers
or
to
judge
and
the
person
accusing.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
non-summary
proceeding
which
has
already
been
set
up
in
full
array
as
required
by
this
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
person,
the
lawyer
in
this
case
mr.
dawley,
did
in
fact
in
appeal
of
thought
the
process
of
the
court.
in
other
words,
was
he
in
contempt
of
thought
in
the
process
of
the
court?
so,
we
were
purporting
him
the
proceeding
that
is
required
under
due
process
and
the
rule
of
this
court
at
the
very
time
in
which
this
motion
was
filed.
now,
the
difference
of
course
is
this.
in
one
instance
we
were
setting
up
the
machinery
for
a
determination
of
the
very
question
that
had
been
raised.
in
the
course
of
that
proceeding,
he
attacks
the
judge
in
order
to
get
him
off
the
bench.
now,
there
are
limits
in
which
a
person
can
go
to
get
a
judge
off
the
bench.
i
think
this
court
well
recognizes
that
in
its
own
opinion
because
it
has
already
stated
that
this
will
not
be
tolerated,
that
these
overt
attempts
from
a
lawyer
to
harass
or
to
force
a
court
from
the
--
force
a
judge
from
the
case
will
not
be
permitted.
i
think
you
said
that
and
you
restated
it
again
very
recently.
so,
i
think
that
is
the
case
here.
they
had
been
thought
it
in
their
efforts
to
get
the
judge
to
disqualify
himself
and
he
refused
to
disqualify
himself
.and
therefore,
they
decided
to
attack
him
in
the
motion
to
change
a
venue,
the
same
ground
that
they
used
when
they
went
to
the
federal
district
court
and
i'll
draw
your
attention
to
that
also
--
that
they
--
while
this
was
pending,
they
proceeded
to
federal
district
court
to
thought
this
process
in
this
proceeding
by
alleging
in
it
the
very
same
things
that
they
alleged
in
the
court
itself.
and
the
district
judge
said
that
there's
no
basis
for
it.
it
is
not
buttressed
up
by
the
affidavits
of
the
evidence
necessary
and
therefore,
he
dismissed
it
or
rather
he
indicated
we
would
not
grant
the
motion
and
later
on,
it
was
dismissed
for
failure
to
pursue.
and
now
that
leads
us
in
the
status,
that's
what
we
had
at
that
time.
now,
if
we're
going
to
pursue,
if
we're
going
to
say
that
a
lawyer
can
pursue
any
extreme
he
desires
in
attacking
the
court,
well
then
we
have
just
made
a
new
innovation
in
the
law.
we
just
departed
from
what
this
court
has
already
indicated.
if
i
say
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
i
must
confess,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
principle
in
your
case
now.
i
think
the
case
is
controlling
in
this
case,
the
delay
but
not
from
[inaudible]
contempt
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
i'm
not
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
i'm
not
familiar
with
that,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
but
i
am
familiar
with
what
you
said
in
the
ungar
case.
and
then,
i
think
in
the
ungar
case,
you
restated
your
principles
that
are
already
been
laid
down
long
and
hard
and
i
don't
believe
you
intend
to
depart
from
the
principle,
that
discretion
of
whether
or
not
this
case
falls
on
one
side
of
the
line
or
the
other.
and
we
most
respectfully
submit,
it
falls
on
the
side
of
contempt.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
mr.
dawley.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
no.
on
page
5
it
does
of
the
transcript,
it
does
not
indicate
who
was
present.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
in
other
words,
why
it
did
not
present
a
justiciable
question
that
own
his
bare
allegation?
mr.
francis
c.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
my
associate
points
out
that
common
wealth
attorney
and
clerk
were
present,
but
i
don't
know
where
that
is
in
the
record,
so
i
won't
believe
at
that
point.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
this
is
just
for
the
moment.
if
i
may
assume,
then
that
is
either
in
there
or
is
not
in
there
for
purpose
of
my
answer.
i
think
the
answer
is
this.
we
cannot
assume
as
you
say,
why
can't
we
assume,
that
is
all
bad
rather
than
all
good.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
in
one
instance,
you
say,
why
can't
we
assume
that
there
was
no
one
present
and
i
would
have
the
very
same
situation
of
how
[inaudible]
case
with
mr.
justice
goldberg.
well,
it
would
be
just
--
mr.
francis
c.
lee
but
the
record
doesn't
show
that
anyone
was
there
and
the
record
doesn't
show
anything
at
all,
but
i
think
you
can
just
speculate
it
the
way
you
like.
but,
i
think
that
it'll
be
hazardous
to
speculate
that
this
was
in
camera
and
no
one
was
there.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
no,
sir.
mr.
goldberg,
i
think
that
would
be
putting
on
unusual
onerous
burden
on
the
members
of
the
court
itself.
but,
i
think
we
can
perhaps
bargain
down
on
whether
or
not
the
allegation
of
the
judge
or
the
peers
of
the
judge
that
mr.
dawley
had
interfered
with
the
process
of
the
court
is
meritorious
or
not.
i
think
what
we've
got
to
decide
here
and
to
decide
in
equation
is
going
to
turn
on
whether
or
not
it's
a
problem.
under
any
circumstances
under
conditions
such
as
this
for
a
lawyer
with
bold
statements,
allegations
about
the
judge
and
about
the
community
unsupported
as
to
what's
going
on
in
the
minds
of
the
people
in
hopewell,
virginia
or
any
other
locality
would
prejudice
them
without
any
support
whatever.
i
think
we've
got
to
decide
somewhere
along
the
way
how
far
a
lawyer
can
go
in
effective
representation.
we
simply
submit
that
this
is
too
far.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
i
think
that's
what
gave
birth
to
it.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
think
that
standing
alone
is
not
contentious.
i
think
it's
the
manner
in
which
you
do
it.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
c.
lee
or
your
manner.
i
think
we
came
to
lose
sight
of
that,
that
i
can
be
contemptuous
of
this
court
simply
by
my
look,
so
i
could
try
to
be
contemptuous
in
this
court
by
my
looks.
no
one
would
know
that
but
you
or
any
other
court,
so
i
think
you
have
to
fall
back
on
what
you
said
in
fisher
against
pace
that
the
trial
judge
himself
must
given
some
credit
for
being
a
man
of
integrity.
he
must
himself
know
or
have
some
responsibility
in
this
manner.
i
think
it's
the
manner
which
you
present
it,
the
context
in
which
it's
presented,
and
your
whole
context
of
the
case
around
it.
and
i
think
all
of
those
things
are
important.
i
guess
my
time
is
up.
