justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
karpatkin,
is
it
narrower
than
that?
i
understood
from
your
brief
that
this
went
through
a
frustration
of
counsel's
right
to
present
claims
on
behalf
of
his
client.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
rephrase
this
as
one
as
denial
of
counsel
or
effective
representation
of
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
do
you
have
to
say
if
--
do
you
have
to
say
necessarily
it's
a
denial
of
counsel,
it's
a
denial
of
right
as
i
understood
your
brief
present
contentions
on
behalf
of
this
client?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
as
regards
the
client
that
how
does
this
apply
to
the
lawyer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
can
have
a
bearing
on
this,
can
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
it
did,
you
would
agree
at
least,
that
the
conviction
should
stand,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
involved
in
a
disciplinary
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
these
convictions
were
sustained?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
another
judge
if
there
is
one,
one's
that
constitutionally
required?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
he
be
aware
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
from
where
are
you
reading?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there
might
well
have
been
that
the
--
this
motion
to
change
venue
would
have
been
denied
ordinarily
that's
the
end
of
such
a
motion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
isn't
what
happened
here
because
the
content,
the
lawyer
and
the
client
are
both
in
held
adjudicated
in
contempt.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
incidentally
mr.
lee
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
?
is
this
non-summary
proceeding?
you
mentioned
that
the
motion
for
a
jury
trial
has
not
yet
been
acted
on.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
the
non-summary
proceeding
is
still
pending
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
still
pending?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
in
addition
to
this
contempt
conviction
that
also
could
result
in
conviction
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
in
fact
against
only
mr.
dawley,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
in
louisiana
that
of
course
is
a
criminal
liable
prosecution,
but
the
principles
of
that
case
have
any
relevance
in
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
was
a
case
of
the
district
attorney
who
accused
all
criminal
judges
of
the
county
of
being
in
league
with
the
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
was
prosecuted
for
criminal
liability.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
reverted
the
conviction.
