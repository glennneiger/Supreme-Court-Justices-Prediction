chief

earl

the
buck
act
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
i
understand
it
and
as
i
read
it
and
as
the
new
mexico
court
interprets
it
and
as
i
believe
the
legislative
debates
carry
out
was
intended
to
not
affect
the
posture
of
state
taxation
on
indian
reservations
at
all.
that
posture
as
i
understand
it
was
this,
sales
by
indian
traders
to
non-indians
taxable,
sales
by
indian
traders
to
indians
not
taxable.
