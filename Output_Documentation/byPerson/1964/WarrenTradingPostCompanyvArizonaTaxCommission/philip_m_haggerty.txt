mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
we
were
talking
about
indians
i
think
much
about
mr.
jacobson
has
said
would
be
most
pertinent.
but
i
don't
think
we're
wrong
we're
talking
about
as
mr.
goldberg
pointed
out
in
arizona
corporation,
doing
business
in
the
state
of
arizona.
i
think
the
briefs
point
out
there
are
approximately
169
traders
involved.
there
are
30,000
to
40,000
businesses
in
the
state
of
arizona
subject
to
the
transaction
privilege
tax.
if
we
were
talking
about
he
history
and
the
background
of
the
indian
tribes
themselves,
that
would
be
important
because
as
i
say
we're
not.
we're
talking
about
a
business
selling
across
the
country
like
any
other
business
in
the
state.
mr.
justice
white
inquired
that
we
issue
a
license.
yes,
we
do.
we
issue
it
on
demand
there
are
no
qualifications.
it
costs
$1.
it
is
a
perpetual
license.
one
is
required
for
each
individual
physical
establishment
but
that's
all.
we
do
not
regulate
by
the
privilege
license
tax
anymore
than
other
states
regulate
because
everyone
in
business
must
have
one.
the
principal
reason
for
it
is
administration
so
that
the
state
tax
commission
knows
who
is
in
business
to
whom
the
forms
are
to
be
sent
each
month
and
to
collect
the
taxes
if
they
are
not
promptly
returned
in
accordance
with
the
law.
but
it
is
not
a
regulatory
statute.
i
think
this
court
in
the
richfield
oil
case
made
a
very
important
distinction.
in
that
case,
i
believe
the
state
of
california
attempted
to
post
a
tax
on
what
was
a
export
out
of
the
state
of
california.
an
exemption
was
claimed
under
the
commerce
clause
and
under
the
export-import
clause.
and
mr.
justice
douglas
carefully
pointed
out
the
distinction
between
the
two.
the
export
clause
just
flatly
in
the
constitution
prohibits
the
state
from
laying
a
duty
or
imposed
on
exports
or
imports.
and
as
the
decision
points
out,
one
speaks
of
taxes.
the
other
speaks
of
regulation,
the
other
being
the
commerce
clause.
one
is
a
prohibition
to
the
states
against
this
taxation.
the
other
is
a
grant
of
power
to
congress
in
the
area
of
regulation.
at
various
times
under
the
commerce
clause,
state
taxes
had
been
held
to
violate
the
commerce
clause
because
they
had
interfered
with
interstate
commerce
itself
but
the
norms
of
this
court
is
laid
down
have
come
to
basically
two
things.
is
it
an
undue
burden
or
is
it
discriminatory.
discrimination
is
obviously
not
an
issue
here.
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
is
an
undue
burden
on
the
indian
traders
has
not
been
raised
by
the
traders,
certainly
it
is
attacked.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
it's
not
the
position
of
the
state
of
arizona
to
say
whether
or
not
an
indian
tribe
can
tax.
we
assume
that
they
can.
it's
not
our
issue.
so
they
are
a
little
sovereign
within
the
state
limited
but
they
have
their
sovereignty.
we
concede
so
thus
a
city
so
thus
perhaps
the
county.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
the
fact
that
there
are
multiple
sovereigns
taxing
with
the
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
this
court
has
indicated
often
enough
in
certain
areas
concerned
with
tribal
self-government,
yes,
they
do
have
a
residual
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
for
the
purposes
of
imposing
taxation
certainly
they
do
impose
many
taxes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes
it
is
a
grant
from
the
state
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
well,
it
is
a
type
of
--
i
think
that's
not
really
particularly
material.
in
other
words,
they
can
tax.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
so
what
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i
think
no
more
serious
than
a
question
of
whether
or
not
we
can
impose
as
a
state,
an
income
tax
where
the
united
states
also
imposes
an
income
tax.
in
other
words,
two
sovereignties
taxing
the
same
event,
the
same
transaction,
the
same
body
neither
one
is
in
derogation
of
the
other.
they
each
have
their
mutual
rights.
we
respect
their
rights
but
we
don't
think
we're
interfering
with
their
tribal
self-government
anymore
than
we're
interfering
with
congress
by
imposing
an
income
tax.
we
both
--
they're
just
two
governments
operating
concurrently
each
entitled
to
look
to
their
own
resources.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
when
they
are
dealing
with
their
own
wards.
as
this
court
said
in
surplus
trading
company
versus
cook,
reservations
are
part
of
the
states
and
state
laws
have
application
there,
say
as
limited
in
their
application
to
the
indian
wards.
so
when
a
tribe
deals
with
its
own
people,
they
are
dealing
within
their
own
area.
that's
their
law,
we
have
tribe
ordinances
that
navajo
tribe
will
call
as
an
extensive
volume
but
those
laws
have
no
application
directly
over
non-indians
on
that
reservation.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes,
yes.
virtually
over
--
well
over
95%
of
the
actual
sales
i
guess
are
with
indians.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes,
all
of
these
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
but
as
a
practical
matter
that
95%
of
the
actual
traded
cost
sales.
we
think
also
that
the
history
of
the
case
well
outlined
is
not
particularly
important
the
history
of
the
tax
in
arizona.
necessarily,
it
takes
some
time
before
a
state
gets
around
to
absorbing
all
that
might
come
within
its
taxing
and
the
fact
that
our
tax
commission
was
perhaps
less
than
immediately
vigorous
of
1935
was
immaterial.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i
have
not
been
there
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
remote
area
of
the
state.
it's
a
normal
retail
store.
it
was
a
--
it's
a
normal
retail
store,
food,
clothing,
equipment.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i
don't
know.
i
never
seen
it
and
i
don't
know
the
corporate
aspects
there
deals
--
those
are
particular
facts
were
not
--
particularly
an
issue
before
courts
so
we
never
went
into
that.
i
think
another
part
was
mentioned
by
mr.
jacobson
which
deserved
some
comment.
this
court
has
twice
upheld
direct
taxes,
state
taxes
on
indians,
both
of
them
involving
oklahoma
taxes,
oklahoma
indian
income
tax
and
the
oklahoma
inheritance
tax.
so
this
court
has
said
despite
the
fact
that
indians
are
wards
and
are
to
be
protected
by
the
federal
government
that
they're
also
citizens
and
that
they
have
not
only
the
rights
but
to
the
duties
of
citizenship
and
that
taxes
are
part
of
those
duties.
and
here
we're
not
even
taxing
the
indians.
so
i
think
that
we
are
not
interfering
with
their
right
of
growth
or
development
or
achieving
full
status
which
perhaps
they
don't
have
because
of
the
tribal
setup
at
the
present
time.
but
we're
not
taxing
them
and
we're
not
interfering
with
their
right
to
govern
themselves.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes,
it
wouldn't
be
covered
by
it
but
i
think
it's
important
because
the
aspect
of
the
general
governmental
policy
of
promoting
the
growth
of
the
indian
tribes
and
raising
the
indians
to
a
full
citizenship
status
was
mentioned.
and
this
aspect
of
the
federal
government's
relationship
with
the
indian
tribes
was
not
thought
to
be
controlling
by
this
court
when
it
was
a
direct
state
tax
upon
the
indians.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
the
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
brief
of
the
appellant
does
mention
and
try
to
compare
commerce
with
indian
tribes
with
the
other
two
parts
of
the
same
constitutional
clause,
commerce
among
the
states
and
with
foreign
nations
and
taxation.
this
is
a
grant
of
power
to
the
federal
--
to
the
congress
and
taxation
per
se
which
does
affect
interstate
commerce
has
not
necessarily
been
held
by
this
court
to
actually
burden
it
in
a
constitutionally
defective
sense.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
this
phrase
that
a
tax
upon
the
privilege
of
engaging
an
interstate
commerce
comes
from
spectrum
--
the
specter
case
and
the
case
has
always
troubled
me
and
i
think
that
the
dissent
written
by
mr.
justice
clark
is
perhaps
a
better
analysis
of
the
entire
picture
that
specter
was
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
an
interstate
carrier
solely
and
had
no
local
basis
in
the
state
of
connecticut
which
was
taxable.
this
court
in
this
last
term
in
a
short
attainment
reversed
a
utah
holding.
pacific
cast
iron
versus
the
state
of
utah
where
there
was
a
totally
interstate
commerce.
the
purchaser
was
in
one
state,
came
to
utah
and
made
the
purchase
and
drove
directly
out
on
his
own
trucks
and
by
citing
only
the
international
harvester
case
reversed
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
utah
and
that
was
an
interstate
transaction.
so
i
think
this
word
privilege
is
not
a
valid
note.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
our
supreme
court
has
described
our
tax
as
a
privileged
tax
but
in
their
analysis
they
have
been
very
careful
to
say
that
this
is
a
differentiation
from
a
sales
tax
which
is
imposed
on
the
sale,
on
the
person
making
a
purchase.
they're
merely
concerned
with
proving
again
and
again
that
this
is
imposed
on
the
person
doing
the
business
and
making
the
sales.
so
the
denomination
of
privilege
has
no
real
relation
to
reality.
we
don't
grab
the
privilege
of
going
into
business
in
the
state.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
the
buck
act
speaks
of
taxes
as
being
including
gross
income
taxes
which
is
what
we
have.
if
the
buck
act
is
applicable,
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i
don't
know.
i
never
thought
of
it.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
but
as
i
say,
we
don't
deal
with
the
sales
tax,
so
frankly
i
don't
know.
i
never
tried
to
look
at
it
in
that
way.
california
i
believe
so
held
in
the
attorney
general's
opinion
which
california
has
a
sales
tax.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
there
are
many
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
relationships
which
followed.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
an
easy
ramification
is
although
we
now
have
a
limitation
on
it
on
contracts
with
the
federal
government,
we
tax
contractors.
we
run
the
same
situation
that
this
court
did
in
(inaudible).
and
where
the
tax
is
on
the
privilege
of
being
in
business
--
of
the
business
of
contract
and
we
can
collect
from
the
contractor
if
it
were
a
sales
tax.
of
course
we
can't
collect
from
the
united
states
government
because
we
can't
tax
them.
but
in
the
privilege
tax
has
always
imposed
on
the
person
doing
business.
it's
a
convenient
method.
it
has
administrative
advantages.
we
tax
sales
made
to
the
state
of
arizona
itself.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i
think
the
trouble
is
unnecessary.
i
think
its
verbiage
not
an
essential
trouble.
i
don't
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
really
it
goes
to
the
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes,
transaction
privilege
tax.
it's
self-described
in
the
statute
and
has
always
been
described
that
way.
the
tax
on
the
privilege,
all
right
of
doing
business
and
of
course
it
covers
many
things
from
beyond
retail
sales,
timber,
mining,
newspapers,
etcetera.
so
i
think
that
arizona
has
not
really
damaged
any
indian
sovereignty
at
all.
we
don't
interfere
with
their
right
of
tribal
self-government
that
was
felt
to
be
quite
important
by
this
court
in
organized
village
of
kake
versus
egan.
i
never
have
known
how
to
pronounce
the
tribe
involved.
and
this
court
held
that
that
is
the
essential
thing
where
a
state
is
seeking
to
enforce
its
laws
insofar
as
the
indians
are
concerned.
in
that
case,
we
had
a
department
of
the
interior
regulation
carefully
spelled
out.
this
court
said,
"there
is
no
statutory
authority
for
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
say
this
and
therefore
his
rule
and
regulation
is
invalid".
so
if
we're
not
hurting
tribal
self-government
and
we're
not
constituting
an
undue
burden
on
commerce,
it
is
simply
a
tax
which
we
collect
from
everybody
engaged
in
business
in
the
state.
it's
nondiscriminatory.
we
have
a
right
--
much
of
a
right
to
tax
this
particular
person
as
we
do
the
tax
anybody
else
engaged
in
business
in
the
state
of
arizona.
we're
not
hurting
the
tribes.
we're
not
interfering
or
burdening
commerce.
we're
not
regulating
the
traders
themselves
in
the
sense
of
the
federal
government
does
closely
regulate
them.
we're
certainly
not
interfering
with
their
regulatory
functions
and
we
just
frankly
think
that
we
have
breached
no
constitutional
law
nor
directive.
we
have
found
no
case
from
this
court
which
would
indicate
that
we
are
even
close
to
reaching
this
constitutional
directive
or
any
constitutional
directive.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
british-american
oil
corporations
is
a
severance
tax
on
a
mining
and
the
lease
was
with
the
indian
tribe
so
that
was
certainly
commerce
of
the
tribe.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
privilege
tax
exists
in
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
and
also
in
the
state
of
indiana
has
a
gross
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
indirectly,
international
harvest.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
shipments
of
materials
in
interstate
commerce.
it
is
a
privilege
tax
in
the
state
of
indiana.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
norton
case
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
it's
a
tax
from
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
commerce
which
happened
to
the
interstate.
the
case
does
not
specifically
say
so
but
it
was
an
interstate
contract,
an
interstate
business
and
it
is
a
privilege
tax.
also,
the
norton
case
of
illinois
that
is
a
privilege
tax
of
the
state
of
illinois.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
but
it's
still
the
same
law
and
that's
still
interstate
commerce,
the
question
then
was
local
nexus.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
it's
because
there
was
a
not
--
it
was
thrown
out,
i
believe
if
i
read
the
decision
correctly,
not
enough
of
an
illinois
incident
to
support
the
tax
so
the
question
is
not
whether
or
not
it's
privileged,
it's
whether
or
not
it's
burden.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
because
it's
totally
within
the
state.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
it's
totally
a
state
transaction.
this
is
a
state
corporation.
we've
granted
them
their
franchise.
they
are
citizens
of
a
state
if
they're
not
corporations.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
doing
business
in
the
state?
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
certainly,
you
could
tax
them
too.
i
presume
we
have
foreign
corporations,
mexican
corporations
doing
business
in
the
state
of
arizona.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no,
i
don't
think
that's
particularly
a
burden.
perhaps,
some
of
them
are
corporations
from
other
states.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
they
may
well
be.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
not
totally.
the
navajo
reservation
includes
arizona,
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
mexico
and
utah.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
it
can't
be
an
arizona
enclave,
no.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
because
physically,
it
goes
outside
the
state.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
a
part
of
the
reservation
is
part
of
arizona.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no
not
an
enclave.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
well
the
language
described
in
--
on
enclave
comes
directly
from
the
constitution.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
well,
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
who
else
would
have
jurisdiction?
now
if
he
committed
a
crime
against
an
indian,
this
court
has
had
--
has
to
be
tried
in
either
an
indian
court
or
united
states
district
court.
but
if
the
trader
commits
a
crime
against
a
non-indian,
i
hope
we
could
try
him.
if
he
wants
to
sue
a
non-indian,
our
superior
courts
would
have
jurisdiction.
this
court
has
said
so
in
a
number
of
cases.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
you
have
to
sue
an
indian
in
the
trial
court,
yes,
under
williams
versus
lee.
so
the
laws
apply
to
the
wards
but
not
as
a
matter
of
territorial
jurisdiction.
when
we
argue
the
case
before
our
own
supreme
court,
the
chief
justice
--
then
chief
justice
asked,
what
is
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state?
and
it
was
very
difficult
to
try
and
explain
or
even
analyze.
it's
mixed.
our
voting
laws
are
applicable.
our
school
laws
are
applicable,
our
health
laws
but
other
laws
are
not,
principally
criminal.
they
have
a
separate
court
system
that
still
a
bone
of
contentions
as
to
whether
or
not
indian
probates
are
perfectly
valid.
they're
recognized
by
the
title
companies
of
arizona
but
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
nobody
has
been
to
court.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
voting
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
generally
they
do.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
this
court
had
so.
criminal
laws
don't
because
the
united
states
code
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
is
specifically
taken
out.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
they
have
a
probate
and
a
--
well,
property
is
--
its
tribal
lands.
there
isn't
--
no
property
other
than
personal
property.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
well,
trespass
of
who
against
whom,
that's
a
criminal
law.
trespass
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
it's
a
violation
of
a
tribal
ordinance.
that's
before
the
tribal
court.
crimes
committed
by
an
indian
or
against
an
indian
are
tribal
only
in
the
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
under
williams
versus
lee,
he
has
to
attempt
to
achieve
satisfaction
from
a
tribal
court.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
as
far
as
the
indians
are
concerned
but
what
about
everybody
else
who
maybe
there.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
so
we're
talking
--
not
talking
about
indians.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no,
the
enabling
act
prohibits
it
that
--
in
our
own
constitution
but
that's
a
federal
statute,
prohibiting
as
from
taxing
the
land,
that
could
be
repealed.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
it's
not
a
constitutional
exemption.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
we
have
admitted
in
our
brief,
they
have
the
authority.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
they
have
the
authority.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
because
of
the
constitutional
provisions
to
regulate
commerce
with
the
tribes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
if
they
exercise
it.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
and
we
have
said
they
have
not
exercised
it.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
they
have
left
this
to
the
state.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
and
we
say
that
the
history
of
the
buck
act
implies
that
congress
just
assumed
--
would
have
left
this
taxing
business
entirely
to
the
states
except
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
so
far
as
the
indians
themselves
are
concerned.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i
don't
think
it
is
essential.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
if
--
no,
it
would
not.
if
i'm
wrong
in
our
conclusions
of
the
buck
act,
it
would
certainly,
i
--
there'll
be
no
satisfaction
to
the
appellants.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no,
i
think
in
terms
on
whether
or
not
the
buck
act
is
applicable
--
oh,
it
could
turn
on
whether
the
buck
act
is
applicable
to
reservations
at
all
to
begin
with
and
where
the
language
constitutes
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
because
it's
not
a
prohibition.
in
other
words,
it's
merely
a
statement
that
congress
has
not
regulated
and
that's
all.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
because
the
amendment
suggest
it,
yes,
we
want
to
prohibit
all
taxes
on
the
reservations
and
the
amendment
was
not
adopted.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
yes,
without
that.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
no,
i
think
we
have
to
find
a
definite
prohibition.
i
think
if
you're
claiming
an
exemption
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
you
are
the
one
who
has
the
entire
burden
of
showing
that
the
exemption
exists
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
if
the
burden
is
on
the
taxpayer,
not
on
us.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
well,
a
jurisdiction
on
the
reservations
does
not
--
exclusive
over
not
--
over
non-indians.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
over
a
non-indian
on
the
reservation?
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
it
could,
yes.
it
does
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
have
statutory
authority
over
the
territorial
jurisdiction.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
well,
i
presume
as
a
point
which
--
beyond
which
you
couldn't
go
without
running
into
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
other
constitutional
provisions
but
in
borad
theory
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
--
yes,
they
do
have
the
authority.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
well,
the
states
have
supposedly
admitted
the
union
on
equal
basis
with
other
states
and
this
is
what
--
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i'd
have
to
as
--
conceived
that
it
is
on
the
reservations
where
they
have
chosen
to
exercise
it.
and
their
restraints
in
many
areas
is
just
that,
a
restraint
and
leaves
the
state
action
free
and
this
court
has
said
so.
unless
it's
a
statute
or
unless
as
an
necessary
interference
with
tribal
self-government
or
a
burden
on
the
tribe
itself,
state
laws
have
general
application
on
the
indian
tribes.
thank
you.
mr.
philip
m.
haggerty
i
think
that
the
state
has
completed
its
argument
unless
there
are
any
further
questions
in
the
court,
we
will
rest.
