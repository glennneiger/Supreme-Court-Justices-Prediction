mr.
edward
jacobson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
on
appeal
from
the
arizona
supreme
court.
it
presents
one
question
only
of
law,
a
question
of
first
impression
to
this
court.
the
question
is
whether
a
state
may
impose
a
license
prohibition
and
a
privilege
tax
upon
a
federally
licensed
indian
trader
for
the
privilege
of
his
engaging
and
making
retail
sales
from
his
trading
post
on
the
reservation
to
reservation
indians.
by
stipulation,
there
is
excluded
from
this
case
any
question
of
off
reservation
sales
to
indians
or
others.
equally
excluded
by
stipulation
is
any
question
of
on
reservation
sales
to
non-indians.
the
case
comes
to
you
with
undisputed
facts
yet
the
history
surrounding
these
facts,
i
shall
briefly
give,
because
i
think
it's
important
to
put
the
action
of
the
arizona
state
tax
commission
into
context.
since
1876,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
given
to
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
the
sole
power
and
authority
to
appoint
traders
to
the
indian
tribes
and
to
make
such
rules
and
regulations
as
he
may
deem
just
and
proper
specifying
the
kind
and
quantity
of
goods
and
the
prices
at
which
such
goods
shall
be
sold
to
the
indians.
the
appellant
in
this
case,
the
warren
trading
post
is
such
a
federally
licensed
indian
trader.
its
trading
post
is
at
kayenta,
arizona
that
is
on
the
navajo
reservation.
it
is
on
the
south
border
of
monument
valley.
it
is
in
navajo
county,
arizona
and
it
rents
its
premises
from
the
navajo
tribe.
pursuant
to
this
congressional
action,
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
has
issued
a
number
of
rules
governing
many
and
we
think
most
phases
of
indian
commerce.
in
the
spring
of
1935,
the
arizona
legislature
passed
a
privilege
tax
act
not
unlike
that
of
illinois
and
several
other
states
levying
a
gross
privilege
tax
measured
by
gross
proceeds
of
sales
on
a
variety
of
occupations
including
for
our
purposes
the
occupation
of
retailing.
in
1940,
the
assistant
solicitor
wrote
an
official
opinion
for
mr.
oscar
chapman,
the
then
assistant
secretary
of
interior
with
specific
reference
to
the
arizona
privilege
tax
stating
that
it
should
not
apply
to
federally
licensed
indian
traders
making
sales
to
indians
on
the
reservation.
that
opinion
was
honored
until
the
assessment
made
in
this
case
in
1958.
in
1958,
the
arizona
state
tax
commission
under
the
privilege
tax
section
which
levies
a
tax
on
retailing.
and
pursuant
to
a
rule
which
it
had
adopted
two
years
earlier
which
said
that
this
section
shall
apply
also
to
indian
traders
levied
an
assessment
of
$2800
odd
dollars
on
the
warren
trading
post.
this
was
the
first
time
in
the
23
years
since
1935
when
the
arizona
privilege
tax
went
into
effect
that
anybody
had
tried
to
tax
a
licensed
indian
trader
on
these
kinds
of
sales
not
alone
in
arizona
but
in
the
other
24
states
which
happen
to
have
indian
reservations
lying
in
whole
or
in
part
within
their
boundaries.
since
that
time,
however,
both
the
state
of
new
mexico
and
the
state
of
california
had
taken
similar
positions.
the
state
of
new
mexico's
case
is
now
pending
before
their
supreme
court
by
stipulation
to
be
determined
in
accordance
with
the
opinion
of
your
honors.
the
california
position
is
reflected
only
in
a
recent
opinion
in
1958
of
the
california
attorney
general,
reversing
a
previous
opinion
to
the
contrary,
his
action
also
having
been
taken
after
the
move
made
by
arizona.
in
october
of
19
--
in
august
of
1958,
my
esteemed
and
deceased
partner
perry
ling
brought
an
action
for
declaratory
judgment
in
the
superior
court
of
arizona.
the
superior
court
held
against
warren
and
for
the
state
tax
commission,
basing
their
opinion
on
thomas
versus
gay
finding
no
difference
between
a
tax
on
an
indian
trader's
stock
in
trade
and
a
tax
on
his
right
to
engage
in
commerce
the
one
came
under
article
i,
section
8,
clause
3
of
the
constitution
and
the
other
did
not.
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
december
of
1963
sustained
the
superior
court
but
on
a
slightly
different
ground.
it
found
that
so
long
as
a
law
was
neither
in
consistent
with
or
burdensome
to
federal
purposes,
it
could
operate
coexistent
with
federal
law
and
found
as
a
fact
this
tax
to
be
neither
inconsistent
with
or
burdensome
to
federal
purposes.
there
was
a
long
dissent
filed
by
now
chief
justice
warren
(inaudible)
one
of
our
court
adopting
the
view
of
the
appellant
warren
trading
post
and
on
october
12
of
1964,
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
our
case
rests
on
three
points.
we
believe
anyone
of
which
independent
of
the
other
should
sustain
the
position
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
should
be
reversed
and
that
these
kinds
of
sale
should
go
tax
free.
very
briefly,
the
three
points
of
these,
first,
we
believe
that
the
national
character
of
indian
commerce
like
the
national
character
of
interstate
in
foreign
commerce
is
such
that
were
there
no
federal
regulations
whatever
the
field
should
be
left
clear
for
federal
regulation
at
such
time
as
it
should
choose
to
occupy
it.
second,
that
as
a
matter
a
fact,
the
field
of
indian
commerce
has
been
heavily
occupied
with
both
congressional
action
and
rules
adopted
by
the
commission
of
indian
--
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
pursuant
thereto
so
that
there
is
no
room
left
for
state
action
that
would
not
be
contradictory
thereto.
finally,
that
there
resides
in
the
indian
tribes
a
degree
of
sovereignty
as
this
court
announced
in
williams
versus
lee,
a
degree
of
internal
sovereignty
which
can
be
impinged
upon
by
the
states
only
upon
specific
authorization
of
the
congress.
we
believe
any
of
the
three
points
sufficient
to
justify
our
position.
going
back
to
the
first
one
every
briefly,
we
believe
that
the
national
character
of
indian
commerce
is
equal
to
the
national
character
or
greater
than
that
involved
in
interstate
and
even
perhaps
foreign.
in
the
decision
of
dick
versus
the
united
states
written
by
mr.
justice
harlan,
this
court
took
much
the
same
position
although
not
related
to
a
privilege
tax
but
related
to
indian
commerce.
we
believe
the
reason
for
the
national
character
of
indian
commerce
relates
to
its
purposes
and
goals
highly
related
to
the
purposes
and
goals
of
the
other
two
fields
namely
the
economic
development
of
the
indians
as
set
forth
by
this
court
in
williams
versus
lee,
the
congressional
legislation
points
to
making
the
tribes
both
self
reliant
and
economically
self-sufficient.
we
think
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
can
best
be
done
and
perhaps
only
be
done
by
the
federal
government.
we
believe
the
geography
of
the
situation
alone
is
an
argument
in
this
favor.
for
example,
the
navajo
reservation
with
which
we
happen
to
be
concerned
today
stretches
across
three
states,
arizona,
new
mexico
and
the
southern
part
of
utah.
not
given
to
the
independent
regulation
we
would
think
of
the
25
separate
states
which
contain
all
or
part
of
an
indian
reservation.
the
occupation
of
the
field
we
believe
to
be
so
great
that
even
if
the
first
premise
were
denied
and
we
present
these
arguments
both
alternately
but
at
the
same
time
believing
in
all
three
as
an
independent
basis.
we
believe
the
occupation
of
the
field
so
substantial
that
there
is
no
room
for
state
regulation.
in
this
court's
decision,
the
pennsylvania
versus
nelson,
you've
set
down
several
rules
for
determining
whether
a
field
had
been
federally
occupied
in
its
totality.
the
last
of
these
rules
i
think
is
interesting
in
view
of
a
recent
advent
on
the
papago
reservation.
the
last
of
the
rules
is
with
the
enforcement
of
state
laws
present
a
serious
danger
of
conflict
with
the
administration
of
federal
justice.
mr.
edward
jacobson
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
one
point
of
law
upon
which
both
parties
are
aggrieved
is
that
sales
to
individuals
on
the
united
states
versus
holiday,
individual
indians
constitutes
indian
commerce.
the
sales
from
the
warren
trading
post
are
to
individual
indians
where
they
may
have
made
some
sales
to
tribes,
the
case
does
not
rest
on
tribal
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
jacobson
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
they
are.
mr.
edward
jacobson
right.
mr.
edward
jacobson
very
good.
but
by
stipulation
--
mr.
edward
jacobson
no,
no.
by
stipulation
your
honor
there
is
excluded
from
this
case
two
kinds
of
sales.
one,
sales
made
off
the
reservation
whether
it'd
be
to
indians
or
to
non-indians.
two,
sales
made
on
the
reservation
of
the
--
mr.
edward
jacobson
--
non-indians
so
we're
concerned
only
with
reservation
sales
to
indians.
mr.
edward
jacobson
correct.
there
has
been
no
question
raised
as
to
that.
mr.
edward
jacobson
yes
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
edward
jacobson
no.
the
corporation
is
not
owned
by
indians.
most
of
the
indian
traders
as
a
matter
of
fact
are
white
indian
traders
and
when
owned
by
corporations,
the
federal
regulations
require
that
those
who
are
to
run
them
must
run
the
gambit
of
federal
license
assuring
themselves
to
the
inspected,
told
what
they
may
carry,
be
sure
that
they
are
morally
suitable
for
the
job
and
so
on.
since
the
decision
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
this
case
but
before
the
petition
for
rehearing
there
came
to
light
the
fact
that
the
papago
tribe
also
in
arizona
levied
a
sales
tax
of
its
own.
we
think
this
is
significant
as
an
illustration
of
the
kind
of
head
on
collision
that
can
happen.
arizona
sales
tax
at
the
time
of
this
case
was
2%
the
rate
has
since
been
raised
to
3%.
the
papago
rate
is
3%.
mr.
edward
jacobson
mr.
justice
white,
every
trader
must
have
a
license.
absent
of
license,
he
is
subject
to
a
$500
fine
plus
his
stock
and
trade
will
be
forfeited
and
the
united
states
marshall
will
chase
him
off
the
reservation.
mr.
edward
jacobson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
jacobson
that
is
the
claim
of
the
state
of
arizona.
we
would
contend
arizona
has
not
the
right
to
make
that
claim.
the
effect
that
the
papago
tax
illustrates
we
think
in
one
fashion,
the
danger
that
can
come
and
the
conflict
that
can
come
because
with
a
total
of
6%
tax
running,
three
from
the
state
and
three
from
the
papagos,
several
things
are
going
to
happen,
either
the
papago
traders
will
be
permitted
to
pass
the
tax
along
to
their
customers,
the
indian
and
both
taxes
are
on
the
trader
both
permit
passing
along
the
customer.
if
the
papago
trader
is
permitted
by
the
commissioner
to
pass
the
tax
along
to
his
customers,
the
papagos
who
can
ill-afford
it
are
going
to
be
paying
a
6%
sales
tax.
if
they're
smart,
they'll
get
off
the
reservation
to
make
their
major
purchases
somewhere
in
arizona
where
it's
only
3%.
mr.
edward
jacobson
yes
your
honor,
it
is
conceded.
that
there
is
no
specific
concession
in
the
pleadings
or
in
the
briefs
but
there
has
been
no
question
with
respect
to
that
ever
raised.
and
so
we
believe
that
that
isn't
--
mr.
edward
jacobson
mr.
justice
white,
you're
correct.
the
tribe
can
levy
the
tax
but
does
need
authority
therefore
from
the
department
of
interior
and
they
give
that
authority
in
the
form
of
what
they
call
a
no
objection
letter
and
included
in
appendix
b
of
our
opening
brief,
the
appellant's
opening
brief.
mr.
edward
jacobson
yes,
pursuant
to
the
--
to
two
things.
one,
a
written
opinion
of
the
department
of
interior,
i
believe
1948.
second,
pursuant
to
a
rule
of
a
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
which
states
that
beyond
the
fees
charged
by
him
to
traders,
they
shall
not
be
--
i'm
paraphrasing
badly,
that
that
these
charge
by
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
to
indian
traders
on
the
reservation
shall
not
be
in
derogation
of
the
indian
pueblo's
right
to
levy
their
own
fees.
and
so,
pursuant
to
that
rule
and
the
opinion
of
the
--
mr.
edward
jacobson
--
department
of
interior?
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
edward
jacobson
the
right
for
the
rule
--
mr.
edward
jacobson
the
right
of
the
derogation
of
the
tribal
right
to
levy
its
own
fees
recognized
by
the
opinion
of
the
department
of
interior,
i
believe
comes
and
there
is
no
flat
answer,
we're
now
talking
about
an
opinion
of
law.
i
believe
comes
from
the
residue
of
sovereignty
residing
in
the
indian
tribes
to
govern
themselves
except
insofar
as
that
sovereignty
maybe
impinged
by
the
federal
government
as
set
forth
in
the
rule
of
this
court
in
williams
versus
lee.
and
that
is
the
basis
upon
which
the
department
of
interior's
opinion
stating
that
the
tribes
may
do
this
providing
they
get
the
department
of
interior
assent
thereto.
that
is
the
basis
upon
which
that
opinion
is
filed.
mr.
edward
jacobson
this
is
a
tax
levied
on
the
trader
in
each
instance
--
mr.
edward
jacobson
to
the
extent
that
the
trader
is
permitted
to
pass
it
on
to
the
indians,
it
is
passed
on
to
the
indians
to
the
extent
that
he
is
not
permitted
to,
it
will
not
be
passed
on.
and
the
man
in
charge
of
that
decision
is
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
given
it's
--
the
authority
by
the
congress
to
set
the
prices
at
which
the
goods
will
be
sold.
mr.
edward
jacobson
that
is
the
fourth
point
and
it's
a
negative
point
and
so
i
didn't
name
it
as
one
of
my
three.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
buck
act
does
not
apply.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
state
of
the
arizona
that
the
buck
act
does
give
that
right.
briefly,
let
me
say
why
we
believe
that
does
not
apply.
the
buck
act
by
its
terms
refers
to
a
federal
area
and
is
operative
only
in
a
federal
area.
i'm
looking
at
page
84
of
appendix
a
of
my
brief
at
the
subparagraph
e
at
the
bottom.
the
buck
act
defines
federal
area
as
to
mean
any
lands
or
premises
held
by
or
acquired
for
the
use
of
the
united
states,
held
by
or
acquired
for
the
use
of
the
united
states.
now
in
the
one
decision
on
this
specific
point,
a
decision
of
the
new
mexico
supreme
court
a
case
entitled
your
food
stores
versus
espanola.
they
held
the
buck
act
not
to
apply
to
indian
reservations
for
the
reservation
was
not
a
federal
area
as
here
defined.
for
example,
in
the
espanola
case
and
in
mr.
felix
combs
book,
they
discussed
the
fact
that
many
reservations
are
really
held
by
the
united
states
in
trust
for
indians,
others
are
not.
oddly
enough
the
santa
clara
reservation
in
the
your
food
stores
case
in
new
mexico
is
held
by
a
patent
in
fee
granted
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
confirming
a
direct
grant
from
the
king
of
spain.
then
you
get
to
the
other
half
of
the
sentence
for
the
use
of
the
united
states
and
there
the
law
is
absolutely
solid
that
indian
reservations
including
those
held
by
the
united
states
in
trust
are
not
held
for
the
use
of
the
united
states
but
rather
for
the
use
of
the
indians.
the
state
also
raised
the
question
in
its
brief
as
to
whether
or
not
the
legislative
history
of
the
buck
act
did
not
oppositely
suggest
from
that
which
i
have
answered
you
and
we
did
go
to
the
legislative
history
and
set
forth
the
fact
that
the
three
amendments
submitted
first
by
mr.
burlew,
then
acting
secretary
of
interior.
the
second
find
mr.
dixwell
pierce,
i
believe
the
executive
secretary
of
the
california
board
of
equalization
and
the
third
by
senator
la
follette
who
at
the
time
was
one
of
the
three
men
in
the
subcommittee.
each
of
those
amendments
was
designed
and
the
discussion
indicates
it
and
our
reply
brief
sets
this
out
in
full,
designed
to
keep
the
status
quo
of
taxation
on
the
indian
reservations.
well,
in
1940,
the
status
quo
was
privilege
taxes
would
not
be
levied
on
sales
by
indian
traders
to
indians
providing
on
the
reservation
and
providing
they
were
reservation
indians.
finally,
just
after
the
buck
act
is
passed
mr.
justice
white,
three
years
later
in
1943,
the
department
of
interior
gave
another
formal
ruling.
this
time
specifically
holding
that
the
buck
act
did
not
apply,
did
not
return
to
the
states
the
right
to
levy
privilege
taxes
on
the
reservation
and
we
believe
that
a
long
continued
administration
(voice
overlap)
at
25
states.
mr.
edward
jacobson
the
opinion
of
the
department
of
interior
indicates
that
the
buck
act
applies
to
what
we
would
consider
federal
military
reservations
and
federal
park
reservations
but
not
the
indian
reservations
as
being
outside
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
jacobson
yes
sir
and
the
states
acceded
to
it.
mr.
edward
jacobson
on
indian
reservations.
mr.
edward
jacobson
correct.
mr.
edward
jacobson
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
indian
reservations
with
the
position
of
the
department.
mr.
edward
jacobson
i
--
yes.
mr.
edward
jacobson
very
good
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edward
jacobson
in
the
senate
finance
subcommittee
after
the
buck
act
had
gone
from
the
house
top
the
senate,
the
department
of
interior
became
worried
and
asked
that
an
amendment
be
given
to
make
sure
that
the
buck
act
did
not
apply
to
indian
reservations.
that
amendment
plus
the
amendment
submitted
by
senator
la
follette
plus
the
amendment
submitted
by
dixwell
pierce
of
california
are
set
forth
in
the
appellant's
reply
brief.
when
the
buck
act
finally
came
out,
it
came
out
with
section
109
which
is
slightly
different
from
any
of
the
three
submitted
amendments
but
for
the
first
time,
talks
about
indians.
there
was
nothing
in
the
buck
act
about
indians
when
it
came
from
the
house
to
the
senate.
109
appears
to
be
the
compromised
language
of
those
three
submitted
amendments.
shortly
after
the
buck
act
was
passed
with
section
109
in
it
which
reads
nothing
in
sections
105
and
106
of
this
title
shall
be
deemed
to
authorize
the
levy
or
collection
of
any
tax
on
or
from
an
indian
not
otherwise
taxed.
after
the
buck
act
came
out
with
that
language,
slightly
different
than
any
of
the
three
amendments,
the
department
of
interior
issued
its
written
opinion.
they
were
slightly
unflattering
about
this
--
the
language
of
109
suggested
it
was
something
less
than
clear
but
stated
that
they
believe
that
its
intent
was
the
intent
of
the
three
submitted
amendments
to
have
indian
reservations
out
of
--
free
from
the
buck
act.
mr.
edward
jacobson
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
edward
jacobson
i've
never
given
that
consideration
and
i
couldn't
give
you
mature
consideration
on
this
further
moment
here.
mr.
edward
jacobson
no.
i
believe
it's
been
brought
up
in
none
of
the
briefs.
our
points
then
in
--
mr.
edward
jacobson
i
think
mr.
justice
black
that
to
the
extent
the
supremacy
clause
is
deeply
related
to
the
internal
sovereignty
of
the
indians
which
still
remains
it
would
raise
the
question.
my
attempt
to
avoid
the
question
directly
was
only
because
i
had
not
given
that
kind
of
consideration
i
would
like
to.
in
conclusion,
let
me
state
that
i
think
that
there
may
come
a
time
when
a
privilege
sales
tax
by
the
states
should
be
imposed
upon
indian
traders
on
the
indian
reservations.
i
think
the
time
will
come
separately
for
different
indian
tribes
and
separately
for
the
states.
it
will
probably
come
more
rapidly
for
wealthy
tribes
which
we
do
not
happen
to
have
in
arizona
in
which
we
are
told
it
exists
in
some
other
states
like
oklahoma.
we
think
it
will
come
more
rapidly
for
states
that
have
undertaken
to
do
more
for
the
indians
and
give
a
quid
pro
quo,
such
as
was
pointed
out
in
williams
versus
lee
when
this
court
suggested
that
arizona
had
refused
to
do
even
those
things
which
would
permit
its
state
courts
to
have
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
perhaps
because
it
could
not
afford
to.
so
we're
not
saying
that
there
should
never
be
a
privilege
tax
on
indians.
what
we
are
saying
instead
is
that
this
is
a
federal
question
which
should
be
federally
determined.
it
is
a
clock
and
a
time
table
which
should
be
read
by
the
federal
government.
we
would
suggest
that
if
this
court
were
to
decide
that
25
separate
states
which
now
have
indian
reservations
could
now
engage
in
25
separate
kinds
of
legislation.
the
court
would
be
faced
with
the
problem
that
either
deciding
the
states
could
do
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
foreign
commerce
and
interstate
commerce
or
else
they
would
have
to
find
that
somehow
the
indians
and
their
problems
and
their
destinies
and
their
futures
were
less
national
in
character.
we
submit
that
is
not
the
fact.
we
believe
it
should
not
be
the
law.
mr.
edward
jacobson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
few
minutes
remaining,
i
would
like
to
attempt
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
that
have
been
asked
one
by
mr.
justice
stewart
concerning
the
nature
and
character
of
the
trading
post
itself.
the
trading
post
is
at
kayenta,
arizona.
kayenta,
arizona
was
a
remote
area
until
about
a
year
and
a
half
ago
when
one
of
the
most
beautiful
roads
in
america
running
from
northern
arizona
across
to
colorado
called
navajo
one
was
opened.
kayenta
is
on
navajo
one.
it
is
at
the
edge
of
monument
valley.
the
trading
post
itself
by
doing
a
little
fast
mathematics
and
looking
at
the
fact
that
a
2%
tax
for
approximately
a
year
netted
a
$2886
assessment
grosses
at
about
$140,000
a
year
from
a
20x30
room
in
which
they
sell
the
necessities
of
life
to
the
indians
range
all
the
way
from
food
to
harnesses
and
seed.
mr.
edward
jacobson
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
that
is
the
heart
of
the
disagreement
between
the
state
of
arizona
and
myself.
it
is
the
position
of
the
warren
trading
post
that
indian
commerce
is
closed
to
state
regulation
without
congress
having
forbidden
it
by
the
constitution
just
as
interstate
commerce
is
closed
to
state
regulation
by
privilege
taxes.
i
must
confine
my
remarks
to
that
because
that
is
our
arena.
it
is
my
understanding
different
from
mr.
haggerty
that
there
has
never
been
permitted
by
this
court
a
privilege
tax
of
a
state
to
be
laid
directly
on
interstate
commerce.
i
do
appreciate
that
this
court
has
gone
beyond
the
specter
case
both
in
the
norton
and
in
general
motors
versus
washington
in
finding
more
and
more
local
incidents
at
either
end
of
the
interstate
commerce
upon
which
a
privilege
tax
maybe
laid
but
the
way
i
read
the
cases,
never
has
this
court
permitted
one
directly
on
interstate
commerce.
i
believe
mr.
haggerty
mentioned
the
international
harvester
case
which
if
i
remember
the
facts
correctly
was
a
sale
completed
entirely
in
indiana.
it
is
true
that
the
purchaser
intended
and
probably
did
transport
the
goods
elsewhere
after
he
had
completed
the
purchase
but
that
then
was
a
totally
local
indiana
activity.
and
so
again,
in
answer
to
your
question,
it
is
the
position
of
the
warren
trading
post
that
the
arena
of
interstate
commerce
--
of
indian
commerce
is
an
arena
that
is
free
and
clear
from
state
regulation
by
privilege
taxation
whether
or
not
there
were
conflicting
statutes
of
the
united
states
congress.
additionally,
we
believe
this
arena
has
been
occupied
by
the
conflicting
statutes
of
the
congress
and
the
rules
adopted
by
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
pursuant
therewith
to
a
degree
way
beyond
the
occupation
of
the
arena
of
--
for
illustration,
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
and
finally,
we
believe
that
indians
and
indian
tribes
retain
a
measure
of
sovereignty
spelled
out
in
williams
versus
lee
that
can
be
described
about
as
follows
starting
before
and
with
worcester
versus
georgia.
they
had
the
sovereignty
of
an
independent
nation.
thereafter
by
conquest
their
external
sovereignty
was
eliminated.
their
internal
sovereignty
to
my
understanding
of
the
law
remains
but
for
those
inroads
into
it
which
the
united
states
government
may
take.
the
only
action
as
i
read
the
law
that
a
state
may
take
without
the
specific
permission
of
the
congress
relating
to
indian
reservations
are
actions
which
do
not
whatever
affect
what
remains
of
the
indian
sovereignty
those
need
no
congressional
assent.
mr.
edward
jacobson
no
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
edward
jacobson
i
--
mr.
justice
--
mr.
edward
jacobson
thank
you.
mr.
edward
jacobson
mr.
justice
brennan,
my
understanding
of
sovereignty
as
i
have
attempted
to
explain
it
to
mr.
justice
black
is
that
arizona
could
impose
this
tax
on
an
indian
trader
on
the
reservation
at
such
time
as
it
was
specifically
so
authorized
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
that
until
that
time,
it
could
not.
now
then
the
counterpart
is
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
did
for
illustration
authorized
all
of
the
states
containing
indian
reservation
to
have
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
provided
they
would
do
a
variety
of
things.
some
of
the
states
such
as
wisconsin
did
the
variety
of
things
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
williams
and
lee,
arizona
did
not.
mr.
edward
jacobson
our
position
on
the
buck
act
mr.
justice
white
is
that
it
was
not
intended
to
affect
the
indian
reservations
and
so
i
would
have
to
accede
that
if
the
state
of
arizona
otherwise
had
the
power
to
tax
indian
of
sales
to
indians
on
the
reservation,
the
buck
act
wouldn't
prevent
it.
and
so
i
have
to
then
show
that
it
doesn't
otherwise
have
the
power
after
showing
the
buck
act
does
not
give
it
that
power.
i
can
tell
that
was
an
unclear
answer.
let
me
try
one
more
time.
mr.
edward
jacobson
yes.
mr.
edward
jacobson
i
would
agree.
mr.
edward
jacobson
right.
mr.
edward
jacobson
right.
mr.
edward
jacobson
let
me
back
into
it
very
briefly
in
this
fashion.
i
would
agree
with
your
basic
premise
that
if
the
buck
act
had
been
a
congressional
authorization
to
the
states
to
go
ahead
with
their
privilege
taxes
on
indian
reservations,
i
would
have
no
case.
secondly,
having
shown
at
least
to
my
own
satisfaction
and
belief
that
the
buck
act
was
not
intended
to
affect
the
posture,
i
then
had
three
arrows
left
to
the
bow
and
decided
each
itself
was
important
and
not
one
that
indian
commerce
is
a
reserved
area
not
open
to
state
regulation
irrespective
of
whether
the
federal
government
had
occupied
it
or
not.
number
two,
it
has
been
heavily
occupied
beyond
the
other
two
areas
of
commerce
discussed
in
the
constitution.
and
three,
the
inherent
sovereignty
of
the
indians
would
itself
prohibit
it.
