mr.
jacobson
you
may
have
told
us
but
if
so,
i
missed
it.
is
there
any
question
in
this
case
that
the
customers
of
the
--
of
your
plan
are
indian
tribes,
(voice

but
at
least
into
--
individual
indians
are
members

i'm
thinking
about
a
story
in
omaha
or
cheyenne.
justice
potter

or
even
detroit
or
new
york.
i
suppose
an
occasional
indian
might
wonder
in
there
buy
a
package
of
cigarettes
or
a
book.
justice

how
can
they
have
power
over
that
kind?
justice

of
the
non-indians.
justice
potter

and
there's
no
question
that
these
are
not
casually
into
the
tribal
indians?
justice
potter
stewart
on
all
the
sales
we're
talking
about
here
are
with
indians
--
justice

--
with
that
stipulation.
justice
potter
stewart
what
kind
of
a
store
or
operation
does
the
appellant
operate
on
this
business?
justice
potter
stewart
a
general
store
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
just
one
unit
or
are
there
several,
do
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
this
isn't
--
an
inheritance
tax
or
a
tax
on
them
would
not
be
--
might
not
be
covered
by
this
constitutional
provision
which
is
commerce
with
them.
justice
potter
stewart
state
tax
upon
them
and
that's
a
--
i
see
that
you're
meeting
that
policy
argument
but
what
we're
concerned
with
here
is
a
constitutional
provision
which
talks
about
commerce
with
the
indian
tribes.
that's
what
truly
at
issue
here,
the
policy

to
one
side.
justice

would
tax,
say,
their
tax
imposed
upon
an
individual
or
a
corporation
for
the
privilege
of
doing
--
of
engaging
an
interstate
commerce
would
not
be
valid,
would
it?
