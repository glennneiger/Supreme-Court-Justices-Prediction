you?
why
wouldn't
it
if
the
federal
law

kind
of
sovereign
of
their
own
recognized
by
--
under
the
comments,
why
wouldn't
it
raise

clause
if
the
state
(inaudible)?
justice

l.
black
we
don't
tax
the
land.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
be
your
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
be
your
view
if
the
congress
has
made
a
law
saying
that
arizona
to
pass
a
new
law
such
in
any
way
in
the
transaction
inside
the
indian
reservation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
have
it
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
they
have
it,
why
do
they
have
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
it
do
they
not
because
they
have
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
it,
if
they
exercise
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
you
must
sue
i
assume
on
the
fact
that
they
have
not
prohibited
either
by
expressly
untimely.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
thought
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
if
you're
wrong
about
that,
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
to
find
an
implied
consent
don't
you,
just
as
you
--
just
as
a
state
does
when
it
starts
to
regulate
interstate
commerce.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
what
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
is
that
true
if
the
government
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
it,
merely
a
question
whether
it's
exercised.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
government
couldn't
have
provided
that
it
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
on
the
reservation.
does
your
case
rest
on
the
idea
that
the
government
couldn't
control
all
what
--
to
be
a
crime,
what
transactions
that
go
on
there,
if
it
wants
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
criminal
laws
and
the
state
laws
and
the
other
laws,
isn't
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
--
what
--
you
mean
some
different
one
like
violating
the
first
amendment
or
something
like
that,
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
far
as
arizona
is
concerned,
why
is
a
governmental
trial
not
exclusive?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
you
would
consider
answer
in
time.
what
do
you
--
you
say
that
his
statement
is
that
congress
has
not
forbidden
this,
it
has
to
be
assumed
they
have
permit
it?
