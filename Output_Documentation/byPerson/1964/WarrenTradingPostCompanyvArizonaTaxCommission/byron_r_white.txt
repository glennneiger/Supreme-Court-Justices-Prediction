justice
byron
r.
white
does
every
indian
trader
or
did
every
trader
on
a
reservation
need
a
license
from
the
federal
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
under
this
tax,
this
arizona
tax,
does
the
trade
--
the
same
trader
need
another
license?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
just
doesn't
--
he
has
to
have
the
license
as
well
as
pay
the
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
this
conceded
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
the
tribe
can
levy
the
tax
without
any
authority
from
any
further
authority
than
the
present
law
of
--
without
any
further
authority
from
the
department
of
interior
or
anybody
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
this
resort
to
some
statute
that
they
may
do
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
where
did
that
right
come
from?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
the
right
for
the
(inaudible)
--
of
the
tribe
to
levy
its
own
fees
that
you
just
referred
to,
shall
not
be
in
derogation
of
that
right.
where
did
that
right
come
from?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
that
is
so,
if
this
were
a
--
if
these
were
a
sales
tax,
i
suppose
under
the
buck
act,
it
could
be
levied
right
on
this
trader
and
exact
it
from
the
indians.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it's
not
passed
onto
the
indians.
i
mean,
it's
not
collected
from
the
indians.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
wouldn't
the
buck
act
permit
a
sales
tax
to
be
collected
on
this
reservation
by
an
indian
trader?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
think
it
applies
to
sales
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
the
department
of
interior
took
the
position
that
you
have
stated?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
buck
act
doesn't
apply
at
all
--
justice
byron
r.
white
regardless
of
the
kind
of
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
it's
a
sales
tax
or
privilege
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
tell
you
this,
this
would
certainly
be
(inaudible)
the
derogation
of
the
sovereignty
whatever
it
may
be
as
the
indians
sought
upon
which
is
predicated
with
tax
as
federal
law
and
why
is
it
that
there's
serious
question
whether
the
arizona
tax
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
this
were
a
sales
tax
would
it
be
--
would
it
or
would
not
--
would
it
or
would
it
not
be
permitted
by
the
buck
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
asked
you
what
if
this
were
a
sales
tax?
would
it
or
would
it
not
be
admitted
by
the
buck
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
did
--
do
you
think
109
outlaws
the
sales
tax
for
example,
section
109?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
does
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
the
--
my
interest
is
in
--
why
cali
--
why
arizona
is
so
careful
to
say
that
this
is
a
privilege
tax
rather
than
a
sales
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
the
ramifications
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
probably
gets
you
--
verbally
gets
you
a
little
trouble
with
indian
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
cases
is
here
could
permit
a
state
to
impose
a
privilege
--
a
tax
from
the
privilege
of
engaging
interstate
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
not
get
to
an
interstate
commerce
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
that
on?
what's
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
just
thinking
of
a
state
that
imposes
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
interstate
commerce.
now
what
case
approves
a
tax
just
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
that
of;
what
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
its
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't
a
tax
from
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
interstate
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
that
there
were
two
results
in
norton,
(inaudible)
is
bad,
that
isn't
what
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
but
part
of
the
fact
that
it's
thrown
out
but
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
incident
could
entitle
to
the
arizona
tax
on
any
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
is
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
reservation
in
arizona?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
even
the
part
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that's
within
the
boundaries
as
an
enclave
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
is
it
part
of
the
territory
of
arizona?
justice
byron
r.
white
its
not
--
it's
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
were
all
within
--
with
--
were
all
within
arizona,
would
it
--
we'd
call
it
an
enclave
or
federal
enclave?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
why
not
like
in
military
reservations?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
is
maybe
there's
--
maybe
that's
--
maybe
this
trader
isn't
even
in
arizona.
these
are
somebody
else's
territory.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
you'd
have
to
sue
an
indian
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
property
laws?
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
not
trespass
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
trespass
by
one
indian
on
another
indian
property
if
there
is
such
a
thing.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
indian
--
what
if
the
trader
wants
to
sue
the
indian
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
why
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
--
why
shouldn't
that
be
the
end
of
the
argument
without
you
ever
having
to
get
to
indian
commerce
or
preempt
or
anything
like
that?
if
the
buck
act
doesn't
cover
this,
does
it
permit
this
tax?
why
shouldn't
it
be
as
mr.
justice
brennan
says,
considered
to
be
a
tax
on
a
trader
in
california?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
isn't
--
no,
i
just
wondered
why
it
--
why
is
that
so
--
why
the
question
was
so
difficult.
it
would
be,
the
buck
act
doesn't
permit
it.
if
congress
hasn't
permitted
it
in
the
buck
act
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
already
--
that
congress
hasn't
permitted,
this
may
not
be
done.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
but
do
you
think
you
have
to
give
all
of
those
grievance
that
an
indian
commerce
to
show
this
or
(inaudible)
have
to
be
a
federal
enclave
on
which
--
i
mean
it,
may
be
that
the
state
could
attack
(inaudible)
like
in
the
washington
tax
case
that
has
something
to
do
with
the
contract
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
these
transactions
takes
place
not
in
the
state
of
arizona
but
in
a
--
on
a
federal
enclave
or
on
federal
property
or
an
indian
property
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
