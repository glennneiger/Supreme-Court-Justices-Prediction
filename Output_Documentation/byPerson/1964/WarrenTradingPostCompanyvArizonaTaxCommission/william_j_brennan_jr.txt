mr.
jacobson,
getting
back
to
that
papago
privilege
tax
that
you
say
has
its
source
perhaps
in
the
reserve
sovereignty
of
the

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
would
a
conflict
between
that
reserve
--
the
exercise
that
reserve
power
and
the
state's
taxing
power,
does
that
create
supremacy
towards
power?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
you're
not
suggesting
it
anyway.
in
your
brief,
i
don't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
recognized
--
maybe
you
don't
have
the
possible
case
before
us
but
what
about
that
situation?
justice
william
j.

do
you
put
any
label
on
this
tax
here?
justice

but
what
jurisdiction

in

exercised
over

otherwise,

justice

let's
not
begin
to
look
at
this
the
reservation
or
as
little
part
of
arizona
as
the
state
of
california.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
jacobson,
obviously,
this
tax
couldn't
be
imposed
on
--
the
trade
in
california
by
arizona.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
would
--
do
you
suggest
that
nevertheless
there
maybe
circumstances
under
which
it
might
impose
this
tax
on
a
trader
on
the
indian
reservation?
in
that
sense,
is
the
reservation
different
from
an
attempt
to
impose
such
a
tax
in
a
trader
in
california?
justice
william
