mr.
william
l.
keller
if
it
please
the
court.
respondents
submit
that
in
this
case,
there
are
three
basic
issues
before
the
court.
the
first
issue
is
whether
the
board
has
exceed
the
authority
delegated
to
it
by
congress
in
picking
and
choosing
the
economic
means
or
weapons
that
were
available
to
parties
during
a
strike
in
furtherance
of
contract
demands
such
action
being
taken
by
the
respondents
to
protect
that
their
legitimate
business
interest
and
solidarity
of
the
bargaining
unit.
we
submit
that
if
the
answer
to
this
question
is
in
the
negative
but
the
question
to
be
determined
is
whether
the
board
properly
balanced
the
conflicting
interest
between
the
respondents
and
the
union.
mr.
william
l.
keller
well,
i
think
we
--
we'll
reach
that
point
because
we
will
point
out
in
our
argument,
respondents,
during
the
course
of
the
hearing,
tried
to
introduce
evidence
of
economic
necessity
to
show
that
it
was
mandatory
that
they
continued
operations
and
we
were
not
permitted
that
opportunity.
we
were
told
that
it
didn't
make
any
difference
of
his
economic
catastrophe
that
the
evidence
wouldn't
be
admissible.
if
the
court
finds
that
the
respondents
have
engaged
in
unfair
labor
practices
then
we
submit
the
question
remains
as
to
the
scope
of
the
board's
order
as
it
relates
to
back
pay.
the
board's
order
would
require
back
pay
to
all
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit,
locked
out,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
best
to
limited
operations
by
the
respondents
during
the
period
of
the
strike
and
lockout.
and
that
such
an
order
is
onerous,
unfair
and
then
it
would
require
additional
financial
loss
to
the
respondents
and
in
addition
to
the
loss
that
did
suffer
during
the
strike.
mr.
william
l.
keller
that's
in
the
record,
yes.
mr.
william
l.
keller
it's
in
there.
mr.
william
l.
keller
i
may
point
out
on
the
brief
--
mr.
william
l.
keller
--
but
that
was
the
ruling
of
the
trial
examiner.
we
raise
it
before
the
board
and
the
board
didn't
think
it
was
very
significant
and
the
response
of
the
counsel
for
the
board's
argument
that
we
fail
to
raise
the
question
of
back
pay.
we
submit
that
that
question
was
raised
in
exceptions
we
filed
with
the
board.
as
the
brief
show,
we're
here
concern
with
the
whipsaw
strike
by
union
against
a
multiemployer
bargaining
unit
with
one
member
of
the
unit
actually
being
picketed.
the
facts
are
they're
here
following
a
bargaining
impact
the
union
struck
the
smallest
member
of
the
bargaining
unit
and
the
other
respondents
lockout
their
employees
who
were
members
of
the
bargaining
unit,
enabling
their
employees
who
were
not
members
of
the
bargaining
unit
to
continue
to
work.
thereafter,
each
respondent
continued
to
operate
their
respective
business
on
an
individual
basis
until
such
time
the
strike
was
settled.
mr.
william
l.
keller
no
sir.
mr.
william
l.
keller
i
didn't
say
“none”,
you
said
each.
mr.
william
l.
keller
i
think
the
record
will
show
that
two
respondents
hired
no
temporary
replacements
and
that
most,
all
respondents,
or
the
remaining
two,
hired
maybe
some
place
between
one
and
four
temporary
replacements.
the
work
was
performed
during
the
strike
and
lockout
principally
by
managerial
employees,
wives
of
managerial
employees,
wives
of
the
owners,
relatives
of
the
owners
--
mr.
william
l.
keller
we
have
one
or
two
in
there
that
have
performed
some
part-time
services
for
the
respondents.
mr.
william
l.
keller
our
contention
is
that
we
would
not
concern
a
big
temporary
replacement
if
they
were
helping
their
husbands
or
the
owners
of
the
business
protect
their
business
interest.
mr.
william
l.
keller
i
beg
you
pardon?
mr.
william
l.
keller
that's
right.
mr.
william
l.
keller
that's
right.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
were
very,
very
few
temporary
replacements
utilized
in
this
case.
mr.
william
l.
keller
well,
the
exception
safeway
stores,
they're
small
respondent
grocers
in
carlsbad,
new
mexico.
mr.
william
l.
keller
the
record
does
not
show
that
sir.
mr.
william
l.
keller
i
think
if
i
recall
correctly
that
food
jet
of
course
was
the
smallest
that
operation
from
the
nature
of
drive-in,
it
had
an
owner
and
his
wife
and
maybe
two
or
three
clerk.
brown
food,
it's
a
sort
of
family
operation
in
addition
to
which
i
think
they
had
approximately
10
employees.
thriftway
had
three
stores,
all
relatively
small.
i
would
estimate
it
10
to
15
--
10
to
12
employees
per
store
and
the
remaining
respondent
cashway
added
store
in
carlsbad,
new
mexico
had
--
they
just
made
10
to
12
employee.
they
were
all
relatively
small
grocery
operations.
mr.
william
l.
keller
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
william
l.
keller
that's
correct
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
time
of
the
initial
lockout,
the
employees
were
specifically
told
that
they
wouldn't
be
return
do
their
job
to
find
the
completion
of
a
strike
and
lockout.
and
those
receiving
fringed
benefits
continued
to
receive
their
fringed
benefits
during
the
period
of
the
strike
and
lockout
and
some
even
took
their
vacations.
mr.
william
l.
keller
that's
correct.
in
this
case,
during
the
negotiations
when
the
respondents
were
confronted
with
the
possibility
of
whipsaw
strike,
they
advice
the
union
and
its
members
that
if
such
strike
occurred
that
they
would
consider
it
to
be
a
strike
against
all
respondent
members
the
multiemployer
bargaining
unit.
in
this
case,
it
is
of
course
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint
that
some
use
was
made
of
temporary
replacements.
the
forged
brief
states
that
under
these
circumstances,
the
respondents
could've
done
one
of
two
things;
number
one,
they
could've
pulled
up
their
operations
during
the
period
of
the
strike
and
lockout.
we
submit
that
this
is
a
wholly
unacceptable
course
of
action
as
a
realistic
matter,
it
couldn't
be
pursued.
we
have
a
respondents
who
are
sitting
on
perishable
inventories
who
must
necessarily
furnish
a
community
of
food
stuffs
and
it's
simply
is
not
realistic
to
require
them
to
remain
close.
the
board's
other
alternative
is
that
the
employers
could
continue
to
operate
with
their
regular
employees.
we
would
like
to
examine
each
of
these
choices
and
demonstrate
why
they
did
not
provide
the
respondents
with
an
acceptable
course
of
defensive
conduct.
and
we
submit
in
this
case
that
all
the
action
taken
was
reasonable,
was
minimal
and
it
was
defensive
in
nature.
they
were
all
act
designed
primarily
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
bargaining
unit
which
this
court
said
in
buffalo
linen,
the
respondents
have
the
right
to
do.
point
one,
as
to
the
choice
that
they
could
have
remained
close.
here,
it's
been
pointed
out
the
picketed
employer,
food
jet,
selected
to
remain
open.
he
would,
does
enjoy
a
major
competitive
advantage
resulting
in
the
weakening
or
this
integration
of
the
bargaining
unit
if
the
other
respondents
had
had
to
remain
close.
in
effect,
conduct
of
this
nature
could
permit
the
union
to
place
the
employers
any
favorite
position,
thus
drawing
the
employers
away
from
the
bargaining
unit.
this
result
of
course
would
enable
a
union
to
accomplish
the
very
objective
of
its
whipsaw
strike.
in
addition
to
the
loss
of
business,
the
employers
who
remain
closed
would
of
course
suffer
losses
as
i
indicated
to
their
perishable
inventories
and
addition
would
suffer
in
all
probability,
permanent
losses
of
business.
as
to
the
board's
choice
that
the
respondents
could
continue
to
operate
with
their
regular
personnel,
this
effect
would
be
to
cause
employers
to
actually
subsidize
the
strike
against
themselves.
in
addition,
we
submit
that
the
board's
rationale
completely
overlooks
to
stop
and
start
nature
of
the
whipsaw
strike.
of
course,
the
whipsaw
strike
has
its
very
objective
placing
the
maximum
amount
of
harassment
and
maximum
amount
of
inconvenience
and
a
maximum
amount
of
economic
loss
on
the
respondents
with
a
minimum
amount
of
inconvenience
and
a
minimum
amount
of
economic
loss
to
the
members
of
the
union.
if
the
respondents
in
this
case
were
forced
to
continue
or
to
attempt
to
continue
their
operations
with
their
regular
employees,
then
this
course
of
conduct
would
almost
to
share
success
of
the
whipsaw
strike.
i
ask
the
court
to
consider
a
minute
what
the
effect
would
be
of
the
start
and
go
or
start
and
stop
picketing
package
would
accompany
whipsaw
strike
in
a
retail
grocery
operation
where
the
strike
could
command
some
stop
two,
three,
four,
five,
six
times
a
day
at
peak
periods
when
the
store
was
full
of
customers
when
we
have
merchandise
that
needed
to
be
unloaded
and
then
on
the
normal
operations.
respondents
submit
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
in
view
of
the
defensive
action
that
they
engaged
in
that
they
should
be
free
from
the
board's
interference
in
attempting
to
pick
and
choose
the
nature
of
their
response
from
the
pressures
of
the
whipsaw
strike.
as
this
court
held
in
insurance
agents,
it
is
outside
the
scope
of
the
authority
delegated
to
the
board
by
congress
to
dictate
to
the
parties
to
bargain
negotiations,
economic
weapons
they
may
utilize.
furthermore,
as
this
court
held
in
the
buffalo
linen
decision
--
mr.
william
l.
keller
i
don't
think
it
has
much
merit
frankly
for
these
reasons.
in
both
cases,
the
parties
were
engaging
in
collective
bargaining.
in
insurance
agents,
we
have
one
in
effect
was
a
partial
strike.
we
had
a
slowing
down
of
the
engagement
of
harassing
activities
on
behalf
of
employees.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
strike
against
the
entire
employer
bargaining
unit.
the
picketing
may
change
from
employer
to
employer
but
in
this
case
as
in
insurance
agents
we
have
at
all
time
a
partial
strike.
i
simply
don't
see
the
distinction
of
the
two
cases.
insurance
agents
was
sufficient
to
control
a
partial
strike
situation;
we
believe
that
insurance
agent
is
applicable
here
in
controlling
that
issue
in
this
case.
furthermore,
this
court
held
in
truck
drivers
local
449
which
is
known
as
buffalo
linen,
the
employee's
right
to
strike
is
not
so
absolute
as
to
prevent
the
employers
from
engaging
unreasonable
self-help
when
the
legitimate
interest
of
the
employers
and
their
employees
collide.
we
don't
see
the
restriction
of
the
buffalo
linen
case
which
would
say
that
we
can't
engage
in
the
reasonable
self-help
that
we
engaged
in
this
case.
in
fact,
we
could
read
and
construe
the
buffalo
linen
case
to
give
us
that
absolute
right.
i
will
now
discuss
the
board's
economic
parity
theory,
which
for
the
first
time,
the
board's
urges
us
before
this
court.
the
board
for
the
first
time
seems
to
agree
that
the
employer
members
of
a
multiemployer
bargaining
unit
are
entitled
to
engage
to
some
degree
in
self-help
to
defend
their
legitimate
business
interest
against
the
whipsaw
strike.
at
page
13
of
the
board's
brief,
the
suggestion
is
made
that
the
non-picketed
employers
may
put
themselves
“in
the
same
boat”
as
the
picketed
employer
by
resuming
operations
with
their
regular
employees
either
in
full
or
to
the
extent
being
appropriate
to
maintain
a
level
of
operations
comparable
to
that
of
the
picketed
employer.
it
has
been
pointed
out
in
respondents
brief
at
pages
33
to
35.
this
is
a
completely
--
completely
unworkable
solution
of
the
problem.
the
first
question
that
would
arise
is
the
“who
is
determined
the
adequacy
of
the
employers
responsible
of
the
whipsaw
picket
strikes?”
is
it
the
employer,
is
it
the
board
or
is
it
this
court?
we
urge
that
the
adoption
of
this
approach
opens
a
whole
new
field
of
inquiry
for
the
board
which
the
congress
has
not
delegated
to
it.
the
second
question
which
occurred
is
what
is
a
comparable
level
of
operations?
first,
can
the
non-picketed
employers
work
only
the
same
number
of
employees
as
the
number
of
replacement
utilized
by
the
picketed
employer
or
should
the
percentage
of
the
replacements
to
the
total
number
of
employees
be
the
test
or
should
perhaps
the
non-picketed
employers
strive
only
for
the
same
percentage
of
the
market
that
they
enjoyed
before
the
strike
commenced
or
can
the
non-picketed
employers
remain
open
their
regular
business
hours
if
the
picketed
employer
remains
open
in
his
regular
business
hours
or
the
picketed
employer
does
not
remain
open
in
his
regular
business
hour?
or
should
the
employer
remain
open
the
same
number
of
hours
each
day
during
the
course
of
the
strike,
or
should
the
non-picketed
employers
use
all
of
their
employees
on
a
part-time
basis
their
by
engaging
in
a
partial
lockout?
or
should
merely
some
of
their
employees
work
on
a
full-time
basis
which
was
still
costs
due
to
partial
lockout?
or
maybe
the
non-picketed
employer's
role
take
their
employees
you
continue
to
work
or
must
they
make
a
selection
and
face
additional
charges
of
discrimination?
these
are
just
a
few
of
the
many
problems
that
are
inherent
in
application
of
the
board's
economic
parity
rule.
it's
obvious
that
multitude
problems
of
the
kind
we
mentioned
make
it
imperative
to
this
court
reaffirm
the
rule
that
it
laid
down
an
insurance
agent,
the
rule
that
it
laid
down
in
buffalo
linen
that
the
employers
are
entitled
to
engage
in
reasonable
self-help
to
protect
their
bargaining
unit
and
their
legitimate
interest
from
the
severe
consequences
of
whipsaw
strike,
and
that
the
board
lacks
the
authority
to
pick
and
choose
for
the
employers,
the
economic
weapons
available
to
them
as
a
means
to
protecting
themselves.
the
respondents
submit
that
here,
they
utilize
all
the
limited
and
reasonable
self-help
in
their
attempt
to
continue
their
operation
on
a
makeshift
basis
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
their
legitimate
business
interests
to
the
service
the
community
with
food
stuffs.
as
i
point
out,
these
were
the
principal
food
stores
in
the
town
of
carlsbad,
new
mexico.
i
would
state
to
the
court
that
some
mentioned
was
made
by
counsel
for
the
board,
concerning
the
right
to
use
replacement.
some
mentioned
was
made
for
the
mackay
case.
we
would
submit
that
here
or
there
was
no
unconditional
offer
on
the
part
of
any
employee
to
resume
his
work
and
to
disavow
or
to
disassociate
himself
from
the
strike
action
that
he
and
his
union
was
engaging
in.
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
in
this
case,
that
the
union
and
its
members
were
on
strike
against
the
entire
employer
bargaining
unit
that
they
were
therefore
active
participants
in
the
strike
that
the
strike
constituted
their
collective
action,
that
they
voted
for
the
strike,
that
they
participate
in
decisions,
that
they
reap
the
benefits
and
that
they
therefore
must
be
accorded
status
as
strikers.
mr.
william
l.
keller
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
william
l.
keller
the
board
ruled
that
safeway
would
not
be
required
to
give
back
pay
to
the
employees
in
the
store
which
was
for
the
period
it
was
closed
during
the
strike.
mr.
william
l.
keller
the
other
one
would.
of
course,
they
took
the
supervisory
employees
who
are
not
in
the
bargaining
unit
with
the
store
that
was
closed
and
transferred
them
over
to
help
operate
their
other
store.
mr.
william
l.
keller
they
place
to
--
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
this
case,
the
board
relies
on
buffalo
linen
and
it's
the
board's
vast
expertise
to
balance
all
these
and
to
delicately
balance
the
conflicting
interests
between
the
parties
to
this
type
of
an
action
and
it
just
doesn't
quite
seem
right
to
the
respondents
that
when
you
attempt
to
offer
evidence
of
economic
necessity
to
show
the
board
why
you
are
compelled
to
continue
to
operate
your
stores,
that
you
are
not
given
that
opportunity.
and
we
submit
to
the
court
that
there
simply
cannot
be
any
delicate
--
balance
in
the
conflicting
interest
when
you
are
not
accorded

i
think
it's

mr.

i
want
to

mr.
william
l.
keller
as
a
matter,
we
want
to
show
to
the
board
as
a
matter
of
economic
necessity
that
these
respondents
could
not
shut
down
their
grocery
operations
with
their
perishable
inventories
and
that
it
is
a
practical
matter
that
they
simply
couldn't
do
it
economically.
mr.
william
l.
keller
alright,
groceries
or
what?
mr.
william
l.
keller
groceries.
they
have
large
perishable
inventories
of
grocery
products,
yes
sir.
we
also
submit
that
it
is
not
practicable
to
require
them
to
remain
close
and
shut
off
as
the
major
part
of
the
community
without
food
stuffs.
i
have
no
further
argument.
