j.
brennan,

i
know
you
used
the
word
“replacement”
also
in
the
brief,
but
do
i
understand
that
those
folks
who
were
hired
were
told
that
they
were
employed
only
for
the
duration
of
the
strike
and
that
the
strikers
will
be
reemployed
when
the
strike
ended?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
know
my
question
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
on
that
set
of
facts.
a
replacement
at
least
in
the
sense
of
permanent
replacement
started
--
quite
the
words?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
have
any
significance
incidentally,
do
you
think?
is
that
fact
that
the
word
temporarily
replacements,
have
any
significance
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
temporary
employee?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
this
instance,
since
they
were
temporary
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
fact
is
not
there
on
the
principle
but
there
is
this
difference
isn't
it
with
temporary
employee
that
has
simply
less
of
an
impact
upon
the
striking
or
lockout
employees
and
their
future
then
did
superseniority
in
the
erie
resistor
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
the
interrogation
of
insurance
agents?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
they
still
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
if
you
didn't,
i
would
suppose
before
you
would
be
here
arguing
if
for
example
we
have
buffalo
linen
on
its
precise
facts
and
the
board
struck
the
balance
differently
today
and
even
at
that
time,
i
suppose
you'd
be
here
arguing
i
know
but
that's
within
what
the
court
has
recognized
to
be
the
board
power
to
accommodate
these
problems
and
again,
subject
only
limited
review
would
be
required
to
sustain
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
expect
us
to
do
at
least.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
maybe
you
do.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
how
--
how
far
can
judges
go
in
assessing
whether
they
did
or
didn't
properly
balanced,
if
we
get
to
that
first?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
keller,
is
there
a
--
is
that
point
you
made
revealed
in
this
record
that
you
were
--
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
present
your
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
could
you
give
me
a
citation
on
that,
i
don't
want
to
waste
your
time
now
but
it
is
in
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
made
a
point
of
it
in
your
brief
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
each
did
hire
outsiders
so
to
speak?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
none
did?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
got
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
wives
of
managerial
employees,
isn't
that
regular
employee
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
otherwise
wouldn't
the
wives
should
be
outside
to
work
for
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
think
the
court
(inaudible)?
