mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
tenth
circuit
to
review
the
judgment
of
that
court,
chief
justice
--
judge
murrah
dissenting,
denying
enforcement
of
the
board's
order
against
respondents
who
are
retail
food
stores
in
carlsbad,
new
mexico.
this
case
and
number
255
which
follows
it,
involves
the
application
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
buffalo
linen
case
which
was
decided
in
1957.
in
the
buffalo
linen
case,
as
i
will
explain
in
greater
detail
in
a
moment,
the
board
sustained
the
--
this
court
sustained
the
board's
conclusion
that
the
nonstruck
members
of
a
multiemployer
bargaining
unit
were
privileged
when
one
of
their
members
was
struck
during
contract
negotiations
to
lockout
or
temporarily
lay
off
their
employees
in
order
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
multiemployer
bargaining
unit
against
the
threat
of
the
whipsaw
strike
that
this
tactic
which
said
in
motion.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
board
reasonably
concluded
that
the
nonstruck
of
members
exceeded
the
limits
of
defense
of
the
multiemployer
unit
and
thereby
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice
when
after
laying
off
their
regular
employees
in
response
to
a
strike
against
one
of
their
members,
they
resumed
the
operations
not
with
their
regular
employees
who
were
ready
and
willing
to
work
but
with
temporary
replacements
for
their
regular
employees.
number
255
which
follows
does
not
involve
a
multiemployer
unit.
the
question
there
is
whether
a
single
employer
is
privileged
even
though
a
strike
is
not
imminent
to
lockout
or
temporarily
lay-off
his
employees
in
order
to
advance
his
bargaining
position.
that
question
was
left
opened
by
the
court
in
the
buffalo
linen
case.
now,
to
turn
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
is
as
i
said
before,
a
multiemployer
of
bargaining
unit
situation,
the
respondents
here
are
members
of
a
multiemployer
unit
of
retail
food
stores
which
has
for
several
years,
bargained
on
a
group
basis
with
the
retail
clerks
union.
in
march
of
1960,
the
parties
reached
a
new
pass
on
a
new
contract
and
the
union
called
a
strike
against
one
of
the
stores,
food
jet.
mr.
norton
j.
come
so
far,
this
is
like
buffalo
linen.
the
four
other
employers
in
the
unit
who
operated
six
stores,
treating
the
strike
against
food
jet
as
a
strike
against
them
responded
by
sending
their
employees
home
when
they
reported
to
work
telling
them
that
they
were
laid
off
because
of
the
strike
against
food
jet.
so
far,
it's
still
like
buffalo
linen.
the
difference
is
this,
at
this
point,
food
jet
hired
replacements
for
the
strikers
which
they
had
a
right
to
do.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
prefer
with
the
adjective
temporary
replacements
and
i
--
by
the
use
of
the
word
“temporary”
as
i've
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
the
board's
view,
that
does
not
that
although
temporaries
are
less
horrendous
than
permanents,
still
the
use
of
temporaries
in
these
circumstances
would
not
be
justified.
mr.
norton
j.
come
as
nearly
as
the
record
shows,
your
honor,
well,
it
hired
a
fair
complement
of
temporaries;
i
don't
think
that
the
record
shows
that
exactly
how
--
how
full
it
was.
the
record
reference
is
there
as
i
recall
them,
record
of
page
40
and
at
39.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
under
the
right
--
under
the
mackay
decision,
food
jet
being
a
struck
employer
had
a
right
to
try
to
operate
during
the
strike.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
does
not
to
the
extent
of
permitting
them
to
substitute
for
the
regular
employees.
under
the
board's
position,
they
might
want
to
use
their
regular
employees
only
on
a
reduced
basis
in
order
to
keep
pace
with
food
jet.
but
whether
food
jet
opened
fully
or
only
partially,
in
the
board's
view
that
would
not
privilege
the
other
stores
in
using
substitutes
for
their
regular
employees.
mr.
norton
j.
come
even
temporaries.
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
were
--
they
were
temporary
as
i
was
going
to
get
to
the
nonstruck
employers
when
food
jet
resumed
operations
likewise
resumed
operations.
they
continued
to
lay-off
against
their
--
or
lockout
against
their
regular
employees
and
they
functioned
with
managerial
personnel,
relatives
of
management,
personnel
manager,
jurial
and
clerical
that
they
brought
in
from
stores
outside
of
the
bargaining
unit
and
also
with
some
temporary
boys
that
they
hired
locally.
they
were
temporary
in
the
sense
as
you
pointed
out
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
was
made
perfectly
clear
that
at
the
end
of
the
strike,
the
regular
employees
would
be
called
back
and
they
were
in
fact
called
back.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
so
but
i
would
like
to
get
to
buffalo
linen
and
what
we
understand
to
be
the
rationale
behind
it
before
i
--
if
i
may
come
back
to
your
question
mr.
justice
goldberg.
before
i
do
that,
i'd
like
to
say
that
and
i'm
going
to
try
to
center
my
argument
around
8
(a)
(1)
because
i
think
that
if
i
come
in
on
8
(a)
(1),
i'm
also
in
under
8
(a)
(3)
or
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
reach
it
as
the
court
did
brought
up
in
sims
case.
8
(a)
(1)
as
the
court
knows,
makes
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
interfere
with
restraint
or
coerce
employees
in
the
exercise
of
rights
guaranteed
in
section
7.
in
determining
whether
there
is
a
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(1),
we
know
the
fact
that
there
--
that
employer
action
tends
to
interfere
with
employee
organizational
activity
is
often
times
only
the
initial
inquiry
where
the
employer
as
in
this
case
was
not
motivated
by
any
anti-union
animus.
it
becomes
necessary
to
balance
the
competing
interest
of
the
employer.
now,
this
court
has
recognized
that
that
is
so
and
that
that
test
is
a
delicate
one
and
that
it's
primarily
the
board's
task
in
the
first
instance
and
if
its
accommodation
is
reasonable
even
though
some
other
accommodation
might
also
be
reasonable,
the
board's
accommodation
is
entitled
to
stand.
now,
the
two
most
recent
cases
that
illustrate
that
in
this
court
are
the
most
recent
case,
the
erie
resistor
case.
you
can
compare
that
with
the
mackay
case.
mackay
said
that
an
employer
in
an
economic
strike
had
a
right
in
order
to
operate
to
replace
the
strikers
even
though,
that
tended
to
interfere
which
strike
activity
unbalance
the
employer's
interest
(voice
overlap)
privilege.
yes?
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
is
no
question
that
it
had
less
of
an
impact
in
superseniority
but
let
me
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
question
is
whether
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
question
is
whether
the
board
could
reasonably
say
that
this
was
more
a
step
beyond
what
you
need
to
defend
the
integrity
of
the
multiemployer
unit
which
was
sanction
in
buffalo
linen
which
i
am
now
going
to
get
to.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i'm
not
going
to
say
that
your
honor.
under
the
board's
view
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no.
buffalo
linen
as
you
will
recall
proceeds
on
this
promise
that
when
you
strike
one
member
of
a
multiemployer
bargaining
unit,
what
you
are
seeking
to
do
--
what
the
union
seeks
to
do
is
to
use
the
pressure
of
the
sales
and
services
of
the
other
stores
which
remain
open
to
force
the
struck
member
to
effectuate
and
in
that
way,
one
by
one
the
union
breaks
off
the
employers
and
if
this
is
carried
to
its
logical
conclusion,
it
will
atomize
the
multiemployer
bargaining
unit.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
suppose
that
reasonably,
you
could
balance
this
in
such
a
way
as
to
conclude
that
as
soon
as
the
--
as
food
jet
resumed
operations,
the
other
employers
had
to
reopen.
however,
there
is
a
possibility
that
even
--
if
food
jet
does
reopen,
he
maybe
reopening
in
a
limping
fashion
so
that
the
other
employers
might
still
find
it
necessary
to
stay
shutdown
in
order
to
avoid
the
whipsaw
starting
up
again.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
point
is
this
your
honor.
that
there
is
no
question
that
--
well,
food
jet
is
in
this
different
position.
the
employees
are
struck.
they
do
not
want
to
come
to
work
for
him
under
the
existing
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
if
he
wants
to
operate,
there
is
no
way
in
which
he
can
operate
other
than
to
hire
replacements
whether
permanent,
temporary
or
otherwise.
the
employees
of
the
other
stores
however,
are
in
a
different
position.
they
are
willing
to
work
under
the
existing
terms
and
conditions.
they
are
not
working
simply
because
the
other
stores
locked
them
out
or
laid
them
out.
now,
that
lockout
or
that
--
pardon
me
your
honor
i
--
that
lockout
was
privileged
in
order
to
defend
the
multiemployer
bargaining
unit
against
destruction.
despite
the
fact
that
the
layoff
prima
facie
interferes
with
employee
activity
and
does
prima
facie
would
violate
8
(a)
(1)
nevertheless
it
is
privileged
in
the
interest
of
protecting
the
multiemployer
unit.
there
is
no
question
that
in
an
ordinary
situation
to
deny
employment
to
strikers
who
are
willing
to
come
back
to
work
under
the
existing
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
is
the
most
literal
and
classic
form
of
discrimination.
now,
the
question
is
and
this
was
the
question
that
the
board
had
to
face,
whether
it
was
necessary
to
permit
the
nonstruck
stores
who
laid-off
their
regular
employees
whether
it
was
necessary
to
permit
them
to
have
this
added
weapon
which
as
i
indicated
in
normal
situation
as
a
classic,
an
elementary
form
of
discrimination
in
order
to
enable
them
still
to
protect
and
defend
the
multiemployer
bargaining
unit
against
the
threat
of
the
whipsaw
strike
and
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
if
you
start
with
the
premise
that
buffalo
linen
privileges
majors
that
are
necessary
to
defend
the
unit
against
the
effect
of
a
whipsaw
strike
and
since
you
are
balancing,
you
privilege
no
more
than
it
is
necessary
under
the
circumstances
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
not
wholly
irrelevant
your
honor
for
this
reason.
when
food
jet
shuts
down,
to
be
sure,
the
other
stores
have
to
shut
down
in
order
to
prevent
the
whipsaw
from
operating.
when
food
jet
opens
up,
the
other
stores
may
still
have
to
remain
close
down
because
if
food
jet
isn't
able
to
open
up
very
much,
it
is
a
practical
matter
that
it
might
be
the
equivalent
of
it
still
remaining
down.
however,
should
food
jet
build
up
enough
of
head
esteem
so
that
even
with
these
replacements,
it
is
doing
substantial
business?
the
other
employers
may
find
that
unless
they
resumed
operations,
the
whipsaw
will
start
up
again.
now,
the
question
is,
“how
can
they
put
themselves
in
the
same
boat
as
food
jet?
"now,
one
way
of
putting
themselves
into
food
--
in
the
same
boat
as
food
jet,
to
be
sure
is
by
hiring
temporary
replacements
just
as
he
did.
however,
that
technique
as
i
tried
to
point
out
carries
with
it
an
added
interference
with
the
rights
of
the
employees
of
these
stores.
there
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
can
protect
the
bargaining
unit
your
honor
by
resuming
operations
with
their
regular
employees
on
a
reduced
basis.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
only
has
--
it
only
has
some
of
its
members
working.
mr.
norton
j.
come
now,
granted
that
there
are
different
ways
of
drawing
the
accommodation
here.
it's
here
--
i
submit
that
the
question
is
whether
the
board
was
wholly
unreasonable
in
striking
the
balance
that
it
did.
now
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
our
position.
we
think
that
buffalo
linen
recognizes
that
this
is
in
the
area
of
balancing
and
that
the
basic
error
of
the
court
below
is
really
in
–
as
judge
murrah
pointed
out
in
the
dissent
is
in
substituting
each
judgment
for
the
judgment
of
the
board.
i
would
be
the
last
to
deny
that
you
could
balance
this
interest
in
another
way
that
it
would
might
be
equally
reasonable.
but
so
long
as
the
board's
balance
is
reasonable
as
we
understand
buffalo
linen
and
of
the
other,
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
board's
balance
is
entitled
to
stand.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor.
we
do
not.
i
will
have
more
to
say
about
insurance
agents
in
the
next
case
but
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
yes
but
i
was
going
to
answer
it
though.
mr.
norton
j.
come
we
believe,
that
in
insurance
agents,
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
board
had
the
power
to
set
in
judgment
on
economic
weapons
in
assessing
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
a
failure
to
bargain
in
good
faith.
the
court
repeatedly
emphasized
and
i
believe
your
honor
you
wrote
both
opinions
for
the
court
that
in
insurance
agents,
the
board
was
seeking
to
support
its
decision
solely
on
the
basis
of
8
(b)
(3)
which
was
the
analog
of
8
(a)
(5).
the
court
recognized
by
citing
twice
in
insurance
agents,
the
buffalo
linen
decision
that
the
problem
was
different
where
the
question
was
whether
these
weapons
unduly
interfered
with
the
employee
rights
under
the
act
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
under
8
(a)
(1).
and
that
is
the
problem
that
we
have
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
problem
which
we
have
in
the
case
to
follow.
for
those
reasons
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes
your
honor.
the
board
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
as
you
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i'm
happy.
i
don't
have
that
passed,
however,
as
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
have
--
for
the
reason
that
i've
indicated,
i've
tried
to
point
out
that
the
situation
here
is
different,
factually
different.
now,
where
you're
balancing,
i
submit
that
shadings
in
facts
might
very
well
call
for
a
different
balance
because
as
the
court
recognized
it's
a
very,
very
delicate
mechanism.
the
board
here
was
split
three-two.
that's
as
close
as
you
can
get.
the
court
of
appeals
was
split
two-one,
i
submit
that
is
an
indication
that
we
are
in
an
area
where
reasonable
men
could
differ
and
that
the
board's
judgment
is
a
reasonable
one
and
is
entitled
to
stand.
before
i
sit
down,
i
should
like
to
point
that
petitioner
in
its
brief,
it's
the
last
point,
raises
some
question
as
to
the
scope
of
the
board's
order.
i
believe
to
submit
that
they
are
barred
by
section
10
(a)
of
the
act
which
says
that
no
objection
not
raise
before
the
board
can
be
asserted
from
raising
that
contention
because
as
i
read
the
--
there
are
exceptions
which
are
set
forth
at
record
21
--
20
to
21.
before
the
board,
they
merely
attacked
the
order
on
the
ground
that
the
evidence
and
the
board
was
not
sufficient
and
the
--
to
support
the
board's
unfair
labor
practices
as
a
matter
of
law
they
did
not
attack
the
breadth
of
the
order.
the
point
they
are
making
here
in
now
is
that
the
board's
order
have
provides
for
reinstatement
that
the
board
should
have
limited
reinstate
--
that
the
board
order
provides
a
reinstatement
of
all
the
regular
employees
of
the
store
who
were
laid
off
they
say,
“it
should
only
be
those
who
are
actually
replaced.”
well,
that
contention,
we
submit,
is
barred
by
10
(e).
in
any
event,
if
it
is
open,
it's
something
for
the
subsequent
compliance
proceeding
and
it
is
not
before
the
court
at
this
time.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
think
that
it
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
could
be
it,
it
could
well
be.
however,
the
board's
position
is
perfectly
clear
certainly
in
the
light
of
the
kroger
decision
which
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
to
be
sure
that
was
subsequent
to
this
case.
but
i
think
that
what
i'm
saying
is
the
implicit
in
the
board's
present
decision
although
it
is
spelled
out
in
greater
detail
in
the
corporate
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
board
is
not
trying
to
second
guess
the
employer.
it
leaves
it
in
the
hands
of
the
employer
to
make
the
judgment
and
as
long
as
he
acts
on
the
basis
of
his
own
best
judgment
and
objective
criteria
without
regard
the
union
membership
considerations,
i
don't
think
that
the
–-
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
with
the
difference,
however,
that
they
were
continuing
the
discrimination
against
their
regular
employees
who
are
ready
and
willing
to
come
to
work.
thank
you.
