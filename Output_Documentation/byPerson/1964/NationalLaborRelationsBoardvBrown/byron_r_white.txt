justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
come,
when
food
jet
reopened
if
whatever
follows
--
with
some
replacement
was
temporary
or
permanent
--
did
it
opened
that
full
blast
--
was
it
trying
to
also
run
at
store
with
some
of
its
other
employee
--
it
didn't
replace
everyone,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
does
have
something
to
do
with
the
question,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
extent
to
which
it
actually
operated
during
the
strike
has
got
something
to
do
with
what
the
other
employers
were
committed
to
do,
doesn't
it
or
not?
i
guess
the
board's
position
is
that
it
isn't,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you'd
answer
me
that
nevertheless
we've
already
indicated
that
the
board
has
a
really
wide
latitude
to
draw
--
strike
these
balances
and
that
the
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
--
that
not
much
of
a
distinction
between.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
on
the
same
basis
though
you
would
argue,
you'd
say
that
on
this
fact,
food
jet
is
going
to
stay
open
and
the
other
respondents
couldn't
hold
down
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that
--
you
mean
to
say
that
food
jet
staying
open
isn't
enough
to
get
out
of
buffalo
linen?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
not
what
(inaudible)
case
is
closed.
i
mean
this
is
--
this
is
--this
is
the
purpose,
this
is
the
real
--
this
is
the
real
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps
the
fundamental
reason
(inaudible)
that
the
other
employer
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course
you
will
have
to
base
it
with
the
food
jet
operator
solely
with
the
supervisor
employee,
solely
the
supervisor
standard,
then
the
other
employers
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
it
is
wholly
irrelevant
from
the
--
what
is
the
availability
of
the
other
employee,
the
employees
(inaudible)
is
wholly
irrelevant
if
you
operate
the
--
namely
the
integrity
of
the
multiemployer
bargaining
unit?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
8
(a)
(1)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
gather
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
do
i
understand
then
that
the
board
thinks
that
buffalo
linen
still
fit
the
law
in
the
sense
--
i
mean,
from
their
stand
point
that
at
the
same
it
came
up
again,
they
would
resolve
the
way
they
did,
make
the
judgment
and
the
balance
the
way
they
did
in
buffalo
linen?
justice
byron
r.
white
presume,
i'd
say,
the
board's
order
doesn't
need
--
their
opinion
doesn't
leave
any
room
of
the
--
the
way
i
read
it,
the
contention
that
you
now
make
that
other
respondents
may
partially
close
down
to
key
their
operations
to
those
of
the
struck
employer.
you
can't
get
anything
like
that
under
the
board's
opinion.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
that's
been
argued
later?
justice
byron
r.
white
safeway
closed
down
one
store
and
went
open?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
now
reinstate
and
give
back
pay
to
employees
and
the
closed
store?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
other
one
would?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
looked
at
your
brief
in
the
record
to
this
business
here
not
being
given
a
fair
opportunity
to
put
in
your
evidence.
i
don't
see
--
perhaps,
you
could
give
us
some
note
about
that
or
something.
give
us
a
record
citation
as
to
--
(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
--
can
you
show
us
where
that
is
by
any
chance?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
thank
you
very
much.
