mr.
david
l.
rose
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
as
has
been
indicated
i
think
from
the
questions
and
the
presentation
of
petitioner's
case,
the
only
issue
here
as
we
see
it,
is
whether
the
united
states
is
responsible
under
the
tort
claims
act
for
the
conduct
of
the
pilot
in
question,
who
is
both
a
captain
in
the
maryland
air
national
guard
and
an
air
technician
of
the
maryland
air
national
guard.
now
we
think
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
should
be
sustained
on
two
independent
grounds,
our
first
position
is
that
civilian
employees
of
the
guard
have
precisely
the
same
relationship
to
the
federal
government
as
do
guardsmen
in
their
military
capacity
and
like
guardsmen
in
their
military
capacity
they
are
not
employees
of
the
federal
government
within
the
meaning
of
the
tort
claims
act.
mr.
david
l.
rose
exactly,
we
think
it's
--
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
making
the
government's
liability
turn
on
the
capacity
in
which
he
was
acting
at
the
particular
moment.
alternatively,
however
we
take
the
position
that
here
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
we
take
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
we
take
an
alternative
position
your
honor,
which
is
that
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
i
think
that
the
federal
government
has
taken
the
consistent
position
that
these
are
state
employees
both
the
tech
and
as
civilian
capacity
and
in
his
military
capacity.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
your
honor.
there
has
been
a
consistent
administrative
interpretation
since
1920
that
these
are
state
employees
and
indeed
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes.
mr.
david
l.
rose
pardon?
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
there
has
only
been
one
exception
to
this
administrative
interpretation
and
that's
in
regard
to
compensation.
the
federal
--
the
bureau
of
employees
compensation
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
does
award
compensation
to
these
people,
but
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
no.
mr.
david
l.
rose
exactly
mr.
justice
white,
they
also
grant
compensation
in
certain
circumstances
to
the
guardsman
acting
in
his
military
capacity,
so
there
is
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
no
your
honor,
it's
under
the
federal
employees
compensation
act
and
that
has
been
interpreted
by
the
bureau
to
extend
to
persons
who
receive
pay,
the
bulk
of
their
pay
from
federal
sources.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
your
honor.
yes.
so
that
the
federal
government
does
not
draw
the
distinction
that
your
honor
adverted
to
and
indeed
the
regulations
here
under
which
this
man
was
employed,
stated
expressly
that
he
is
employed,
considered
employee
of
the
state.
mr.
david
l.
rose
that's
just
an
administrative
interpretation
as
i
understand
it
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
rose
there
is
no
way,
no
judicial
review
your
honor
and
the
bureau's
decision
is
final,
but
let
me
say
that
your
honor
that
the
compensation,
the
coverage
or
the
employment
relationship
under
compensation
statutes
has
traditionally
been
considerably
broader
than
the
employer/employee
relationship
for
carrier’s
tort
liability.
in
one
instance
the
real
question
is
who
foots
the
bill,
that's
the
compensation
test
and
if
i
carry
this
tort
liability,
the
question
is
who
has
control
and
that's
usually
a
narrower
test
and
we
think
if
that
dichotomy
is
followed
here
that
you'll
find
that
this
person
was
a
state
employee.
i
think
it's
fair
to
start
from
what
i
take
it
to
be
the
established
proposition
that
personnel
of
the
guard
in
their
military
capacity
are
state
employees
and
not
federal
employees
under
the
tort
claims
act.
the
national
guard
is
defined
as
the
federally
recognized
militia
of
the
states
and
although
the
national
guard
is
paid
from
federal
funds,
it's
armed
and
equipped
by
the
federal
government
and
the
discipline
and
training
and
organization
are
in
accordance
with
federally
prescribed
standards.
the
day-to-day
direction
and
supervision
and
control
of
the
guard
is
in
the
states
and
the
states
retain
the
right
to
select
and
appoint
the
personnel
and
to
supervise
and
discharge
them.
for
this
reason
therefore
the
courts
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
no,
it
can't.
no,
approval
by
the
federal
--
as
for
officers
approval
by
the
federal
government
as
a
prerequisite
to
receiving
federal
funds
but
they
--
the
national
guard
officers
who
are
not
federally
recognized
and
therefore
do
not
receive
federal
funds
are
in
fact
retained
by
the
states.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes.
mr.
david
l.
rose
both
from
the
federal
government.
and
his
employment
in
a
civilian
capacity
was
a
condition
prerequisite
--
his
employment
in
the
military
capacitor,
his
commission
as
an
officer
was
a
condition
prerequisite
to
his
employment
as
a
technician.
but
the
uniform
decisions
of
the
courts
both
state
and
federal
have
held
that
state
employees
are,
excuse
me,
military
personnel
of
the
guard
are
not
federal
employees
despite
the
fact
that
they
are
paid
from
federal
funds
and
despite
the
fact
that
they
must
be
federally
recognized,
because
the
states
control
and
direct
them
and
select
the
men
for
employment.
it's
the
states
who
initiate
the
selection
of
officers
and
indeed
at
the
enlisted
man
level
the
federal
government
can
only
withdraw
a
grant
recognition
on
a
unit
basis.
as
for
the
officers
it's
granted
on
an
individual
basis.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
i
think
it
was
--
the
relationship
was
establish
basically
in
1916,
your
honor
by
the
national
defense
act
in
which
the
federal
government
laid
down
standards
and
setup
this
mechanism
of
federal
recognition
in
return
for
granting
federal
pay.
that
changed,
but
since
then
the
relationship
i
think
is
basically
the
same.
the
courts
have
as
i've
indicated
uniformly
interpreted
this
relationship
to
be
that
the
state,
the
militia,
the
state
guardsmen
in
their
military
capacity
are
employees
of
the
state
and
not
of
the
federal
government.
and
this
uniform
line
of
decisions
was
in
effect
ratified
and
approved
by
congress
in
1960
in
the
adoption
of
public
law
86-740
which
is
popularly
called
the
national
claims
act.
congress
expressly
referred
to
this
line
of
decisions
and
stated
that
it
accepted
them.
at
that
time
it
was
proposed
to
broaden
the
federal
tort
claims
act
to
encompass
military
members
of
the
guard
as
well
as
--
the
amendment
would
be
to
broaden
the
tort
claims
act,
to
provide
for
coverage
of
both
military
and
civilian
personnel
of
guard.
and
congress
rejected
that
proposal
on
the
ground
basically
that
there
was
insufficient
federal
control
who
warrant
the
imposition
of
federal
tort
claims
act
liability.
on
page
24
of
our
brief
your
honor
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes
your
honor.
the
senate
committee
said
we
have
decided
not
to
broaden
the
tort
claims
act
because
to
encompass
such
personnel
because
the
crux
of
this
matter
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
national
guard
is
primarily
under
state
control
as
opposed
to
federal
control.
and
house
committee
said
the
same
thing
and
in
fact,
it's
not
appropriate
to
grant
juridical
relief
against
united
states
under
the
tort
claims
act
in
this
situation
because
and
i'm
quoting
again,
federal
authorities
do
not
have
command
and
control
over
national
guard
units
and
members
not
in
active
federal
service.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
the
bill
that
was
originally
introduced
your
honor
would
have
broaden
the
act
to
encompass
both
civilian
personnel
and
military
personnel
and
congress
rejected
that
bill
and
in
its
place
in
its
entire
units,
place
provided
at
administrative
and
legislative
remedy
for
both
military
personnel
of
the
guard
and
civilian
personnel
guard.
now
and
the
legislative
history
reflects
the
congress
wish
to
assume
its
moral
obligation
for
damage
done
by
guardsmen
in
either
capacity.
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
because
the
guard
is
equipped
with
modern
weapons
such
as
jet
aircraft
and
tanks
and
anti-aircraft
missiles
and
it
has
become
a
reserve
component
of
the
national
defense
forces
that
they
wish
to
assume
a
moral
obligation,
and
wish
to
handle
that
obligation
administratively
and
legislatively,
if
you
will.
for
claims
of
less
then
$5,000,
the
secretary
was
authorized
to
pay
them
himself,
for
claims,
in
excess
of
that
amount,
he
was
authorized
to
pay
$5,000
and
refer
the
matter
to
congress
in
effect
for
a
mechanism
comparable
to
prior
bill.
but
in
short,
congress
has
ratified
the
uniform
line
of
decisions
holding
the
personnel
in
their
military
capacity
are
not
federal
employees
and
provided
this
legislation
instead.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
yes,
both
lines
were
considered
your
honor.
one
was
in
effect
adopted
as
a
basis
for
action,
the
line
holding
that
the
military
personnel
are
state
employees.
the
other
was
recognized
and
it
was
indicated
that
this
court
had
not
passed
upon
it
and
congress
instead
of
adopting
no
legislation
in
regard
to
the
civilian
personnel
chose
to
provide
this
very
same
administrative
and
legislative
remedy
as
it
did
for
the
military
personnel.
mr.
david
l.
rose
but
it
wasn’t
--
it
wasn’t
a
direct
repudiation
your
honor.
it
was
indicated
that
this
line
was
dubious,
because
it
was
in
conflict
with
the
uniform
administrative
interpretation.
it
was
also
what
congress
did
i
think
was
the
most
significant
thing.
although
the
courts
that
adopted
this
distinction
between
military
and
civilian,
congress
declined
to
do
so.
congress
provided
the
same
remedy
in
regard
to
both
and
if
it
had
wished
to
ratify
both
lines
of
decisions,
all
it
had
to
do
is
to
provide
this
remedy
for
the
military
personnel
and
not
for
the
civilians,
instead
they
provided
it
for
both,
they
treated
them
the
same.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
i
think
this
is
--
this
is
a
possible
interpretation
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
congress
recognized
that
there
was
no
rational
bases
for
distinguishing
between
the
two
and
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
relationships
in
regard
to
each.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
i
will
attempt
to
do
your
honor.
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question
to
mr.
wolcott,
all
civilian
employees
with
the
exception
of
few
typists
must
be
must
be
selected
from
members
in
officers
of
the
national
guard.
this
is
because
they
are
the
key
personnel
of
the
guard
who
keep
the
units
ready
on
a
day-to-day
basis
and
that
is
found
in
the
regulation
on
page
73,
paragraph
2b.
mr.
david
l.
rose
on
my
brief
your
honor
of
the
government's
brief,
excuse
me.
page
73
towards
the
bottom
of
that
page,
it
says
air
national
guard
civilian
personnel
must
be
federally
recognized
members
of
the
air
national
guard
of
the
state
territory
etcetera
except
for
females
and
temporary
personnel.
grade
three
typists
were
described
in
the
record
as
the
only
personnel
who
are
not
military
members
and
the
reason
for
this
is
that
the
other
guard
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
that's
what.
this
is
the
regulation
providing
for
caretaker.
they
are
called
air
technicians
by
the
regulation
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
rose
he
was
federally
recognized,
yes
indeed
your
honor.
he
was
not
in
in
federal
service.
mr.
david
l.
rose
not
in
active
federal
service.
this
was
a
regularly
recognized
national
guard
unit
of
the
maryland
air
national
guard.
in
order
to
qualify
for
civilian
employment
or
so
called
caretaker
employment,
you
must
be
a
member
of
the
air
national
guard
and
indeed
you
must
hold
the
same
position
in
your
civilian
capacities
you
do
in
your
military.
now
the
so
called
caretakers
perform
the
very
same
functions
that
in
their
civilian
capacity
that
they
do
in
their
military.
they
perform
training
functions,
operations
and
supply
and
maintenance.
in
each
capacity
the
federal
government
pays
most
or
all
of
their
salary.
in
each
capacity
the
checks
are
drawn
on
the
federal
treasury.
in
each
capacity
the
federal
government
provides,
supplies
of
equipment.
in
each
the
federal
government
says
minimum
standards.
but
in
each,
the
only
sanction
for
failure
to
comply
with
these
standards
is
withdrawal
of
federal
recognition,
cutting
off
federal
funds
and
in
each
case
your
honor,
the
individuals
who
are
to
be
employed
are
selected,
hired,
promoted,
and
demoted
by
the
adjutant
general
of
the
state
or
someone
acting
for
him
under
the
policy
and
direction
of
the
governor
of
the
state.
mr.
david
l.
rose
that
is
incorrect
your
honor.
there
is
direct
testimony
to
the
contrary
in
the
record
and
it’s
also
in
the
regulations
themselves
which
i
just
referred
you
to,
you
refer
to
page
74.
the
authority
to
employ
fixed
rates
of
pay,
establish
work
hours,
supervise
and
discharge
employees
is
in
the
adjutant
general
of
the
states.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
yes
and
that
in
fact
applies
only
to
the
military
side
your
honor.
the
withdrawal
of
federal
recognition
is
as
–
his
recognition
as
an
officer
of
the
guard.
now
if
he
were
--
if
that
recognition
were
withdrawn,
he
would
automatically
be
disqualified
from
holding
his
civilian
employment
at
the
same
time.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes
sir.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes
and
this
is
one
of
the
--
this
is
one
the
basis
that
the
courts
are
relied
upon.
however,
if
you
refer
to
the
statute
itself
your
honor,
you
will
see
that
it
was
not
--
i
think
that
it's
not
the
statute
doesn’t
authorize
the
secretary
to
delegate
any
authority.
the
authority
was
always
in
the
state.
if
you
refer
to
page
68
of
our
brief,
that
is
the
statute
itself
is
at
the
very
top
of
that
page
and
they
are
referring
to
the
--
the
secretary
concern
shall
fix
the
salaries
and
shall
designate
the
person
to
employ
them.
now
originally
under
caretaker
statutes,
the
individuals
were
detailed
by
the
unit
commanders.
however,
in
1935,
they
wished
to
allow
this
to
be
done
on
a
state
wide
basis
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
1935
act
which
we
have
set-forth
on
page
31
of
our
brief
indicates
quite
clearly
the
congressional
understanding
and
intent
under
present
law
and
i
am
quoting
now
from
the
senate
report,
under
present
law
states
are
required
to
select
caretakers
from
the
units
that
have
the
material.
section
6
will
permit
the
handling
under
the
adjutant
general
or
other
proper
state
officials
of
the
caretakers
as
approved.
in
other
words,
the
congressional
understanding
has
always
been
that
state
officers
are
the
ones
to
select
the
employees,
to
select
them
and
to
supervise
them.
now,
if
the
court
please
i
would
like
to--
mr.
david
l.
rose
your
honor
that
was,
he
was
sent
to
the
federal
school
in
his
military
capacity
as
an
officer
of
the
air
national
guard
as
is
frequently
done
in
these
cases.
we
think
that
this
indicates
that
the
federal
government
has
a
close
relationship
with
the
guard,
but
it's
not
a
basis
for
distinguishing
between
the
guard
in
his
military
capacity
and
the
guard
in
his
civilian
capacity.
in
each
capacity,
they
are
hired
by
the
commanding
officers
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
adjutant
general,
in
each
they
are
supervised
and
directed
by
the
same
person
and
in
each
they
wear
the
same
uniform,
in
each
capacity,
they
are
a
paid
by
checks
drawn
on
the
federal
government.
but
in
each
capacity,
the
states
acting
through
the
adjutant
general
under
the
direction
and
supervision
of
the
governor
has
the
right
to
select
the
people,
to
direct
them,
to
set
the
working
hours
and
conditions
and
to
tell
them
when,
where,
and
what
to
do
and
when
to
do
it
and
this
we
think
is
the
critical
test
under
the
tort
claims
act.
in
addition
to
the
lack
of
a
rational
distinction
between
the
personnel
in
their
military
capacity
and
those
in
their
civilian
capacity,
we
have
a
long-standing
congressional
intent
and
understanding
that
they
be
considered
employees
of
the
states
rather
than
--
than
federal
employees.
ever
since
1920
or
before
when
the
act
was
new
this
has
been
the
administrative
interpretation
and
as
i've
indicated
before,
it's
in
the
very
regulations
under
which
this
man
was
hired
that
he
is
a
state
employee.
moreover,
it's
been
adopted
by
congress
as
a
basis
for
action.
for
example,
in
1954
because
these
persons
were
not
employees,
where
not
considered
to
be
employees
within
the
meaning
of
the
civil
service
retirement
act,
congress
adopted
--
amended
the
social
security
bill
and
said
that
for
those
purposes
they
shall
“be
deemed
to
be
employees
of
the
state.”
similarly
retirement
legislation
allowing
payroll
deductions
for
state
retirement
funds
was
based
and
this
quote
is
set
forth
on
page
36
of
our
brief
on
the
understanding
of
these
employees
although
paid
from
federal
funds
are
considered
to
be
state
rather
than
federal
employees.
and
as
i've
indicated
earlier,
we
think
the
very
adoption
the
national
guard
claims
act
itself,
congress
recognized
there
was
no
rational
basis
for
distinction.
and
in
regard
to
both
of
these,
congress
shows
to
provide
an
administrative
and
legislative
remedy
rather
than
a
judicial
remedy
and
we
think
the
type
of
remedy
which
should
be
afforded
is
clearly
a
policy
matter
for
congress
in
that
it's
policy
decision
should
be
honored
by
this
court.
in
both
capacities,
we
think
there
is
a
close
analogy
between
a
government
doing
things
with
the
assistance
and
if
you
will
through
the
state
and
the
government
doing
it
through
independent
contractors
and
the
tort
claims
act
although
recognizing
--
the
tort
claims
act
shows
we
think
that
it
was
not
intended
to
resume
tort
liability
for
persons
merely
because
the
government
paid
the
bill
and
then
in
ultimate
sense
controlled
the
program
because
congressmen
express
exception
to
the
tort
claims
act
for
the
employees
of
independent
contractors.
similarly,
we
think
that
the
program
here,
the
national
guard
program
is
closely
analogous
mr.
justice
goldberg
to
similar
programs
where
the
federal
government
supplies
part
or
whole
of
the
money
to
the
state
setting
forth
criterion
standards
which
the
states
must
meet
in
order
to
get
that
federal
money.
if
the
state
did
not
wish
to
have
national
guard
troops
or
didn't
wish
to
have
a
unit,
they
would
be
perfectly
free
to
do
so.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
rose
my
understanding
is
the
answer
is
yes.
i
think
the---
i
have
in
mind
the--
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes
i
think
that
that
program
sets
forth
the
standards
for
the
state
employees
to
administer
it,
i
think
the
vocational
educational
programs.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
your
honor
it
furnishes
the
money.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
that's
how
it's
done
here
your
honor,
if
you
look
at
the
statute,
it
says
that
the
secretary
may
allot
from
funds
from
appropriated
funds
money,
may
spend
money
for
these
purposes.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
but
it's
from
the
funds
allotted
in
the
federal
treasury
to
the
states
for
national
guard
purposes.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
the
easy
answer
is
that
they
do
it
in
the
military
side,
as
well
as
on
the
civilian
side.
i
am
not
perfectly
sure
your
honor.
it
is
my
understanding
that
there
are
other
programs
of
this
kind,
but
i
am
not
positive
and
i
wouldn't
want
to
give
you
a
firm
answer.
let
me
say
in
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
a
few
minutes
ago
that
one
of
the
basis
for
the
holly
line
of
decisions
which
has
said
that
these
are
civilian
employees
was
that
the
--
that
the
authority
of
adjutant
general
was
delegated
to
him
that
was
basically
a
state
authority,
no
a
federal
authority
and
i
think
i've
already
refuted
that
by
reference
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
1935
act.
the
other
basis
for
--
another
basis
for
the
holly
decision
was
that
the
federal
government
is
supplying
these
technicians
in
order
to
maintain
federal
property.
but
the
national
defense
act
that
which
caretaker
statutes
is
a
part
sets
forth
expressly
the
fact
that
the
maintenance
of
property
is
the
state
function
and
responsibility
just
as
the
training
and
the
other
operations
of
the
national
guard
are.
and
lastly
the
holly
decision
rested
upon
the
idea
that
the
adjutant
general
was
merely
acting,
the
adjutant
general
of
the
state
was
merely
acting
as
an
agent
of
the
federal
government
in
administering
this
caretaker
program.
that
is
wholly
incorrect.
the
adjutant
general
is
appointed
and
subject
to
the
direction
and
control
of
the
governor
of
the
state.
indeed
in
many
instances
the
adjutant
general
is
not
even
a
federally
recognized
officer
of
the
national
guard.
he
is
appointed
and
subject
to
the
direction
and
control
of
the
state
government
and
all
his
conducts,
all
his
actions
are
done
by
order
of
the
governor
as
it
is
indicated
in
this
case
in
page
662
and
663
of
the
record.
you'll
see
the
change
of
mccoy
status
from
one
air
technician
status
to
another
and
it
says
adjutant
general
by
order
of
the
governor,
that's
the
way
the
adjutant
general
administers
this
whole
program,
both
the
military
side
and
the
civilian.
now,
lastly
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
to
the
question
of
what
capacity
he
was
acting
in.
the
orders
at
the
moment,
this
is
our
alternative
position,
the
orders
which
are
set
forth
in
page
209
indicate
that
he
was
ordered
to
fly
in
his
military
capacity
as
a
military
member
of
the
guard.
it
was
assigned
by
order
of
the
squadron
commander
that
is
the
person
who
gave
him
the
direction
was
the
squadron
commander.
similarly--
mr.
david
l.
rose
kilkowski,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
he
was
but
it
was
clearly
--
the
order
was
clearly
given
in
his
military
capacity.
it
was
given
as
by
order
of
the
squadron
commander.
the
chain
of
command
in
both
instances
went
back
to
the
adjutant
general
and
to
the
governor.
but
in
giving
this
military
order
he
was
clearly
wearing
his
military
hat.
this
is
also
we
think
clearly
a
training
flight.
the
district
court
found
that
it
was
a
proficiency
flight
and
the
word
proficiency
is
indicated
by
the
record
by
everyone
who
testified
on
the
subject
proficiency
in
training
means
the
same
thing
and
colonel
kilkowski
and
captain
mccoy
both
indicated
that
these
flights
which
both
the
air
technicians
and
the
weekend
warriors,
if
you
will,
made
during
the
week
because
they
couldn't
do
it
all
during
their
regular
training
period,
these
proficiency
flights
were
training
flights,
a
function
reserved
to
the
state.
mr.
david
l.
rose
captain
mccoy
indicated
that
when
he
made
flight
checks
that
this
was
also
done
in
his
capacity
as
captain
of
the
--
as
a
captain
and
officer
in
the
maryland
air
national
guard.
but
this
particular
flight
had
no
specific
maintenance
purpose,
this
was
conceded
by
all.
the
general
understanding
was
that
was
it
was
a
proficiency
flight,
a
training
flight,
that
was
the
understanding
of
both
captain
mccoy
and
colonel
kilkowski
and
that
was
what
the
order
which
directed
them
to
make
the
flight
said.
mr.
david
l.
rose
there
was
testimony
your
honor
that
when
a
pilot
in
the
maryland
air
national
guard
flew
an
airplane
he
did
so
on
his
capacity
as
a
military
member
of
the
guard.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes
your
honor,
that
was
the
general
testimony.
but
here
it
was
a
training
flight.
we
think
it
is
even
clearer
that
this
was
a
military
type
flight.
this
military
training
committed
but
the
constitution
and
by
the
statutes
to
the
control
of
the
state
and
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
that's
my
--
that
was
what
the
record
here
would
indicate.
mr.
david
l.
rose
no
your
honor
we
think
that
even
if
they
were
other
flights
that
this
particular
flight
was
clearly
a
military
flight
because
it
was
a
training
flight.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
there
are
flight
checks
for
--
which
have
primarily
a
maintenance
function.
but
captain
mccoy
was
both
the
aircraft
maintenance
officer
in
his
military
capacity
as
well
as
being
the
maintenance
chief
in
a
civilian
capacity.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
rose
no,
no
i
said
it
would
be.
i
think
they're
both,
but
i
think
it’s
clean
and
clear
here
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
not
as
i
understand
the
record
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well
your
honor
if
you
look
at
his
deposition
which
is
further
on
in
the
record
and
i’m
afraid
i
don’t
have
the
page
number
at
my
fingertips,
but
his
deposition
indicates,
he
states
specifically
about
these
flights
that
because
as
an
aircraft
maintenance
chief
there
was
no
requirement
in
his
job
description
as
aircraft
maintenance
chief,
there
was
no
requirement
for
him
to
fly.
he
himself
thought
that
when
he
perform
these
functional
test
flights
he
was
doing
so
in
his
military
capacity
as
aircraft
maintenance
--
i’m
sorry
as
squadron
maintenance
officer
which
was
his
military
function.
but
we
don’t
think
it
is
necessary
to
go
that
far
your
honor,
because
this
was
concededly
not
a
functional
test
flight.
the
only
function,
the
only
maintenance
functions
which
he
performed
here
were
looking
at
the
instruments
and
seeing
how
the
airplane
flew,
the
same
thing
any
pilot
does
at
anytime
and
the
critical
test
under
maryland
law
is
who
has
the
right
to
supervise
and
direct
and
control
and
that
test
we
think
here
is
met
only
by
the
state
with
the
right
to
direct
and
control
was
wholly
in
state
officials
acting
under
the
general
supervision
and
direction
of
the
adjutant
general
and
the
governor.
mr.
david
l.
rose
not
in
any
meaningful
sense
that
i
know
of
your
honor.
if
your
honor
will
refer
to
page
662
and
663
of
the
record,
you
can
see
then
kind
of
the
orders
that
were
issued
both
in
his
military
capacity
and
in
his
civilian
capacity
and
you
see
that
they're
exactly
the
same,
page
660
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes.
mr.
david
l.
rose
that's
right.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes
that's,
right
your
honor,
we
think
they
are
in
basic
error
and
we
think
there
was
just
a
basic
misunderstanding
of
the
relationship
here.
in
each
instance
the
adjutant
general
asked
by
order
of
the
governor
for
the
general
supervision
and
direction
and
control
of
the
governor.
indeed
it
would
be
very
anomalous
your
honor
if
i
may
just
conclude
on
this
note,
to
say
that
for
the
entire
work
week
these
people
are
civilian
employees
and
therefore
under
the
control
of
the
federal
government
and
that
the
only
time
the
state
asserts
its
control
over
the
national
guard
is
on
the
weekend
when
they
have
a
training
drill,
because
20%
of
the
personnel
are
they
are
on
the
base
working
in
their
civilian
capacity
all
during
the
week
and
the
governors
we
think
would
be
very
shocked
and
surprised
to
learn
that
they
didn’t
have
control
over
the
national
guard
when
it
was
not
in
active
federal
service.
we
think
the
relationship
is
the
same
for
all
rational
purposes,
the
only
distinction
being
whether
someone
is
subject
to
court
marshal
or
not,
during
the
week
he
would
not
be,
during
weekend
he
would.
but
as
far
as
any
relevant
criteria,
we
don’t
think
there
are
any
basic
distinctions.
we
think
that
congress
has
chosen
to
prescribe
an
administrative
and
legislative
remedy
and
we
think
the
congressional
decision
should
be
honored
by
this
court.
