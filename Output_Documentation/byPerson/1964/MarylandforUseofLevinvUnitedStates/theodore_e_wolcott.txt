mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
may
it
please
the
court.
these
are
suits
for
wrongful
death
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
they
arise
out
of
the
collision
of
a
capital
airlines
viscount
plane
and
a
t-33
military
jet
owned
by
the
united
states
and
used
by
the
air
national
guard
of
maryland.
the
crash
took
place
in
may
of
1958.
this
case
gets
to
the
court
under
rather
unusual
conditions.
there
were
two
sets
of
suits
started,
one
in
pittsburgh
and
the
other
in
district
of
columbia.
the
district
of
columbia
suit
was
heard
first
on
the
issue
of
whether
mccoy,
the
pilot
of
the
jet
t-33
was
in
fact
an
air
maintenance
air
technician
employed
by
the
united
states
under
section
709
and
therefore
a
caretaker
of
the
aircraft
at
the
time
of
the
accident.
the
district
of
columbia,
through
judge
mathews
held
a
hearing
on
that,
and
found
that
he
was,
that
the
united
states
was
liable.
thereafter
judgment
was
entered
for
damages
and
in
the
meantime
the
same
suit
by
other
passengers,
the
capital
airlines
plane
came
out
to
be
heard
in
pittsburgh.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir,
all
passengers
were
killed,
the
crew
was
killed
of
the
viscount,
the
t-33
had
just
the
pilot
mccoy
and
a
passenger
and
the
only
survivor
was
mccoy.
there
is
no
issue
here
as
to
the
negligence
of
mccoy
and
nor
is
there
any
issue
here
as
to
the
amount
of
the
award
for
the
wrongful
death.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir,
the
government
takes
the
stand
that
at
the
time
mccoy
was
piloting
the
t-33,
he
was
on
a
training
mission
as
a
military
member
of
the
maryland
air
national
guard
and
that
therefore
under
the
usual
run
of
the
air
national
guard
cases
there
is
no
liability,
whereas
we
take
the
position
and
the
lower
courts
up
to
the
circuit,
third
circuit
held
that
mccoy
at
that
time
was
serving
in
his
function
as
caretaker
air
technician
of
the
aircraft.
but
the
interesting
thing
about
this
case
is
that
at
the
trial
in
pittsburgh,
judge
gorrelli
(ph)
by
a
stipulation
of
all
counsel,
including
government
counsel,
stipulated
that
the
record
in
the
district
of
columbia
would
be
the
record
in
pittsburgh
and
so
we
have
a
situation
where
the
record
is
identical.
meantime
in
the
district
of
columbia
the
government
went
up
on
appeal
on
this
issue
of
whether
mccoy
was
an
air
technician,
maintenance
technician
under
709
or
that
he
was
purely
a
military
member
on
a
training
flight.
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
unanimously
affirmed,
writing
an
opinion
through
judge
faye,
finding
that
mccoy
definitely
was
a
care
--
acting
in
a
capacity
of
a
caretaker
at
the
time
and
this
was
not
a
training
flight.
in
the
meantime
the
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir
the
district
court
plus
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
–
for
washington
circuit
and
of
course
the
pittsburgh
court
also
found
it.
in
the
meantime
the
government
had
also
appealed
from
the
pittsburgh
decision
and
i
would
argue
that
while
the
awaiting
the
decision
of
district
of
columbia.
the
district
of
columbia
decision
came
down
first
and
i
supplied
the
third
circuit
with
copies
of
that
decision.
then
the
government
applied
to
this
court
for
certiorari
and
certiorari
was
denied.
i
supplied
the
third
circuit
with
a
copy
of
that.
then
a
few
months
later
the
third
circuit
came
down
with
the
decision
and
this
is
on
exactly
the
same
record
your
honors,
and
with
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
decision
before
them
and
they
reversed.
it
was
a
split
decision
and
the
majority
i
might
say,
i
think
it
fairly
can
be
stated
that
the
majority
was
divided
as
between
themselves.
judge
smith
wrote
an
opinion
in
which
he
interestingly
enough
made
his
own
finding
of
fact,
as
i
point
out
in
the
brief,
disregarding
the
rule
–
on
rule
52,
which
is
the
less
clearly
the
erroneous
rule.
judge
smith
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
what
he
did
your
honor
was
this.
he
said
that
since
most
of
the
record
was
by
stipulation,
he
was
in
as
good
position
as
the
trial
court
to
make
his
own
findings
and
therefore
he
was
not
bound
by
the
clearly
erroneous
rule.
i
might
comment
on
that
by
saying
that
the
trial
court
had
four
witnesses,
live
witnesses
before
it,
that
is
judge
mathews
here
at
the
district
of
columbia,
as
well
as
some
depositions
and
it
strikes
me
that
if
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
applies
to
a
circuit
court
of
the
same
circuit
reviewing
the
testimony,
it
certainly
would
apply
even
more
so
to
a
court
once
removed
as
as
the
third
circuit
was
and
furthermore
if
that
rule
were
to
obtain
then
certainly
counsel
would
be
less
likely
to
ever
stipulate
into
the
record
a
situation
–
as
here
because
then
they
would
be
faced
with
an
appellate
court
disregarding
that
is
clearly
erroneous
rule
and
and
there
would
be
no
incentive
to
save
the
time
and
trial
of
the
court.
anyway
judge
smith
held
--
he
went
on
two
points;
firstly
he
held,
that
he
would
disregard
the
whole
line
of
caretaker
cases,
the
holly
line
of
decisions,
which
hold
there
where
a
caretaker
maintenance
man
hired
and
paid
by
the
united
states
under
a
federal
statute
operates
a
vehicle
even
though
he
is
a
non-activated
military
member
of
the
state
national
guard,
the
government
is
nevertheless
liable
because
he
is
an
employee
hired
to
take
care
of
the
property
and
there
are
the
whole
line
of
holly
decisions,
about
four
or
five
in
number.
he
also
disregarded
the
meyer
decision.
he
stated
that
he
just
didn't
see
any
distinction
between
a
caretaker
and
a
member
of
the
national
guard
for
the
purposes
of
liability
under
ftca.
then
he
went
further
and
he
said
even
assuming
that
mccoy
was
an
employee
under
section
709,
nevertheless
the
united
states
not
liable
because
this
he
found
was
not
a
flight
in
which
he
performed
any
duties
as
civil
air
maintenance
caretaker,
but
it
was
a
training
flight
and
as
to
that
point
to
say
that,
that
is
entirely
contrary
to
the
findings
of
both
district
courts,
entirely
contrary
to
the
finding
of
the
anonymous
court
in
the
district
of
colombia
court
of
appeals
and
also
totally
unsupported
by
the
record
and
also
a
situation
where
the
court
decided
to
the
make
its
own
new
and
contrary
findings
of
fact.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir
when
captain
mccoy
steps
into
that
airplane
he
wears
an
air
national
guard
uniform
as
a
member.
and
it’s
the
same
uniform
as
the
u.s
air
force.
now
if
i
may
to
go
back
into
the
background
of
this,
the
organization
of
the
air
national
guard
is
very
detailed
and
its
founded
upon
a
federal
statutory
structure.
there
are
a
complete
set
of
statutes
under
which
the
air
national
guard
is
setup.
it's
really
a
part
as
it
is
stated
in
32
u.s
101
or
102
that
the
air
national
guard
and
the
national
guard
is
a
part
of
our
first
line
of
defense.
this
is
not
the
case
anymore
gentlemen
where
you
have,
when
little
malicious
of
the
old
days
where
they
just
stopped
riots
or
worked
in
that
order.
this
is
a
104th
fighter
interceptor
squadron
using
high
powered,
intricate
armed
aircraft
that
have
as
their
range
over
a
number
of
states
and
are
part
of
a
uniform
integrated
national
organization
supervised
by
the
national
guard
bureau
located
in
the
pentagon.
and
every
detail
of
the
training
is
written
in
regulations
of
the
air
force
issued
by
the
secretary
of
the
air
force
and
closely
supervised
in
every
detail
with
regular
air
force
people
stationed
at
the
base
supervising.
the
united
states
finances
this,
every
detail
from
top
to
the
bottom,
it
supplies
the
equipment
including
this
aircraft
which
was
owned
but
the
united
states.
this
aircraft
being
so
intricate,
a
lot
of
the
instruments
of
warfare
that
is
supplied
by
the
united
states
to
this
national
guard
being
so
expense
and
intricate,
they
have
to
develop
a
highly
specialized
and
trained
force
of
technicians,
so
that
the
weekend
warriors
when
they
come
can
take
out
this
very
intricate
and
expensive
equipment
and
fly
it.
in
an
airplane
that
is
particularly
necessary
because
you
need
a
lot
of
preventive
maintenance,
because
if
something
goes
wrong
and
you're
in
the
air
it's
too
late,
you've
got
to
do
it
before
it
gets
into
the
air.
so
they
developed
this
core
of
technicians
which
the
united
states
provided
for
the
care
of
its
own
equipment
and
mccoy
was
one
of
them.
under
section
709,
they
provide
for
the
creation
of
this
core
of
maintenance
technicians,
provide
for
payment,
provide
for
fixing
of
hours,
and
rate
of
pay
and
then
there
is
series
of
intricate
detailed
regulations
which
govern
these
technicians;
leave,
rates
of
pay,
qualifications,
manning
schedule
and
so
on.
they
can't
just
pick
anybody
out,
they
have
to
be
qualified.
mccoy
was
trained
under
a
government
program.
he
spent
nine
months
at
cannon
air
force
base
at
government
expense,
where
he
was
trained
as
an
air
technician,
so
he
could
qualify
to
maintain
this
government
equipment.
now
at
the
time
mccoy
was
at
this
base
in
maryland,
he
was
employed
as
a
full-time
civil
air
maintenance
technician
–
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
by
the
government
sir,
paid
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes,
sir
–
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
he
was
paid
directly
by
the
united
states
treasury.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes,
i
would
say
that
he
was,
because
i
think
they
were
united
states
records,
that's
right
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
he
was
an
employee
of
the
air
national
guard
as
an
agency
and
as
an
employee
of
the
united
states,
that's
right
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
i
would
say
that
the
most
accurate
way
to
put
it
sir
would
be
that
he
was
employed
by
the
united
states
to
assist
the
united
states
take
care
of
equipment
and
also
to
assist
the
national
guard,
because
the
equipment
belongs
to
the
united
states.
the
united
states
under
the
statute
said
that
all
of
this
equipment
is
and
shall
remain
the
property
of
the
united
states.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
the
member
of
the
national
guard
could
have
prevented
him
from
flying
that
because
it
had
to
be
approved
by
the
member
of
the
national
guard,
in
this
case
it
was
colonel
kilkowski.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir,
that
was
his
function,
to
check
out
equipment.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes,
sir
because
colonel
kilkowski
was
also
an
air
technician
and
that
was
his
superior.
so
he
would
know
what
he
was
doing
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
that
point,
i
might
say
that
immediately
after
the
accident
that
colonel
kilkowski
certified
and
--
colonel
kilkowski
certified
and
had
to
make
out
an
application
for
federal
workman’s
comp
--
federal
compensation
under
the
federal
compensation
act
as
a
federal
employee
and
colonel
ebaugh
a
federal
officer,
a
united
states
officer,
air
force
officer
assigned
to
the
state
of
maryland
as
fiscal
and
property
officer,
well
a
federal
employee
certified
to
the
u.s
department
of
labor
and
interestingly
enough
he
certified
with
emphasis.
he
certified
that
at
the
time
of
this
occurring,
mccoy
was
acting
in
his
capacity
as
air
technician,
civil
air
technician
and
not,
and
he
underlined
the
word
not
as
it
turned
out,
and
not
as
a
member
of
the
air
national
guard.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well
it's
possible
sir
that
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
as
a
matter
of
fact
sir
he
was
under
the
ultimate
control
and
direction
of
the
united
states
and
not
of
the
guard
because
the
united
states
is
that
one
that
over
--
that
oversaw
his
qualifications,
would
accept
his
qualifications,
they
could
hire
and
fire.
they
fixed
his
hours,
they
fixed
his
rate
of
pay,
they
tell
exactly
what
his
duties
are.
naturally
if
they
won't
let
him
work
that's
something
else
sir,
but
i’m
talking
about
the
direct
supervision
and
control
and
the
ultimate
right
of
control
which
was
in
the
united
states.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well
they
could
have
done
that
because
he
their
employee.
they
had
that
control
over
him
all
the
time.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
may
i
say
this
your
honor,
on
that
point
that
under
section
709
and
under
the
regulations
angmr
40-01
which
i
referred
to,
they
have
--
they
can
hire
and
fire
him.
the
only
--
the
way
that
the
adjutant
general
of
maryland
comes
into
it,
he
is
merely
acting
under
a
delegated
power,
which
is
reserved
be
taken
away
anytime
by
the
air
force
because
he
has
to
qualify,
he
has
--
and
if
they,
for
example,
revoke
his
federal
recognition
then
he
is
out,
he
is
through,
he
can't
be
paid
anymore.
they
are
ones
who
pay
him
directly
and
they
can
cut
off
his
pay.
there
is
every
indicia
of
control.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
there
maybe--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
not
quite
sir.
i
would
put
it
this
way
that
you
maybe
referring
to
the
mechanics,
but
in
effect
if
the
united
states
withdraws
its
recognition
sure
there
maybe
a
certain
channel
for
which
its
effective,
but
the
united
states
is
the
one
that
withdraws
its
recognition,
the
united
states
is
the
one
that
grants
it.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir
for
this
reason.
in
this
particular
--
in
this
particular
it
isn't
necessary
generally,
but
in
this
particular
case,
mccoy
was
chief
of
maintenance,
supervisor
of
maintenance
and
in
order
to
effectively
perform
his
job,
he
had
to
be
able
to
fly
that
aircraft
and
qualify
as
a
pilot
rated
on
military
aircraft,
but
as
it
was
stated
by
general
wilson
and
also
by
colonel
kilkowski
that
in
order
to
perform
effective
maintenance
and
to
do
the
job,
that
it
was
necessary
that
he
be
able
to
fly
the
airplane
to
check
the
maintenance,
see
how
it
was
performed,
see
how
the
airplane
responded
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
every
time
he
did
fly,
he
did
check
the
maintenance,
that
was
a
part
of
his
function
as
an
air
technician.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
i
would
say
that
would
have
been
as
long
as
he
was
qualified
to
fly
the
airplane?
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
not
necessarily,
he
just
had
to
have
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
i
would
say
it
didn't
except
that
in
the
case
where
he
was
an
officer,
a
supervisor,
as
he
was,
he
was
in
a
supervisory
maintenance
capacity
and
as
a
matter
of
policy
they
required
that
he
be
an
officer
of
the
maryland
air
national
guard.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
in
that
case
it
would,
yes.
i
am
sorry,
i
misunderstood
you,
if
you
were
a
member
of
reserve
corp,
then
you
would
have
the
rating.
in
other
words,
he
had
the
aeronautical
rating,
the
ability
to
fly
that
aircraft,
which
was
a
necessary
part
of
his
job
as
civilian
maintenance
chief.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
job
description
sir,
of
supervisory
maintenance
chief
it
is
stated
that
it
is
desirable
that
he
be
qualified
to
fly
the
aircraft.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
his
immediate
superior
sir
was
colonel
kilkowski
who
was
the
chief
maintenance
technician
for
the
base.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir
and
he
was
the
one
who
authorized
this
flight.
he
was
also
--
he
had
a
title
under
the
maryland
air
national
guard
too.
i
might,
i
might
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
pardon
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
i
might
add
that,
that
when
he
took
off,
mccoy
was
carrying
a
passenger
by
the
name
of
charmers
who
was
interested
in
becoming
a
cadet
with
the
air
force
flying
school
and
he
was
in
the
sense
recruiting
for
the
u.s.
air
force
and
charmers
had
to
sign
a
release
to
the
united
states
in
the
event
of
any
accident.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir,
that's
correct,
but
i
was
going
to
say
sir
in
that
connection
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
state
of
maryland
claims
sovereign
immunity
the
practical
effect
to
that
was
just
to
the
united
states
and
apparently
the
united
states
was
very
much
aware
of
that.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well,
that
doesn't,
i
would
say
that's
only
a
small
part
of
it,
that--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
under
the
regulations,
the
air
national
guard,
the
technicians
are
employees
hired
under
709
or
section
90,
that
under
the
defense
act,
where
their
duties
are
to
repair,
inspection
of
armament
and
equipment
of
the
united
states,
they
are
highly
trained
and
qualified
for
that
purpose.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
it
is
quite
different
sir
because
this
is
the
part
of
our
first
line
of
defense
of
maintaining
a
uniform
national
force
and
the
government
retains
control,
sets
forth
all
the
standards
in
detail,
training
qualification,
use
and
so
on,
pays,
pays
for
everything.
for
example,
here
they
paid
for
the
buildings,
they
pay
for
everything
single
item
of
equipment
at
this
base
in
maryland.
the
only
thing
they
didn't
pay
for
probably
was
in
janitorial
duties
and
i
believe
there
the
state
of
maryland
has
paid
about
25%.
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
well--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
i
do
draw
a
definite
distinction
sir,
in
the
sense
that
this
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
duties
as
a
member
of
the
maryland
national
guard.
as
an
air
technician
he
was
employed
full
time
to
take
care
of
these
air
crafts,
supervise
it,
other
employees
are
also
paid
by
the
united
states
from
tuesday
to
saturday
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
then
this
would
be
a
different
case.
then
that
would
be,
then
this
distinction
that
i
talk
about,
which
is
based
upon
the
caretaker
line
of
cases
would
disappear.
however,
i
say
this
your
honor
that
even
if
assuming,
but
not
admitting,
that
he
was
not
an
air
technician,
i'd
say
that
the
structure
and
i
am
not
original
in
saying
that
because
it
is
commented
by
other
appellate
court
judges
that
the
structure
of
the
air
national
guard
is
such
that
it's
a
highly
intricate,
organized,
efficient
first
one
in
force
in
our
national
defense
structure
supervised
from
top
to
the
bottom,
the
qualifications
of
the
men,
the
equipment,
everything
financed
to
the
last
cent
practically.
the
control
of
our
government
over
that
through
the
various
defense,
air
force,
army
secretary
is
so
detailed
and
so
close,
that
actually
all
of
these
members
of
the
various
national
guards,
particularly
the
air
national
guard
are
really
employees
of
the
united
states
under
the
ftca
and
it
is
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
no,
they
don't
your
honor,
for
this
reason
that
the
--
there
is
a
line
of
cases
which
hold
that
with
respect
to
non-activated
members
of
the
national
guard
that
the
united
states
is
not
liable
under
ftca.
however,
this
however
has
not
been
passed
upon
by
this
court.
a
number
of
judges
in
some
of
these
cases
say
that
they
feel
that
there
should
be
no
distinction
and
that
the
government
should
be
liable
because
in
essence
this
is
really
a
national
force
and
the
other
is
really
a
fiction.
and
--
mr.
theodore
e.
wolcott
yes
sir.
well,
i
might
say
your
honor,
that
in
addition
to
the
certification
by
the
government
agencies
that
mccoy
was
an
employee
at
the
time,
that
there
is
presumption
under
the
law
of
maryland,
with
presumption
we
have
to
heed
under
the
language
of
the
ftca
because
if
the
government
is
a
private
person,
would
be
liable
under
the
law,
the
place
it
would
happen,
there
is
a
presumption
of
the
law
of
maryland
that
the
operator
of
a
vehicle
is
the
agent
or
servant
or
the
owner
of
the
vehicle.
and
also
that
he
was
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
employment,
these
are
two
very
strong
presumptions
and
there
was
no
rebuttal,
they're
rebuttable
but
there
was
absolutely
no
rebuttal
on
the
part
of
the
government.
