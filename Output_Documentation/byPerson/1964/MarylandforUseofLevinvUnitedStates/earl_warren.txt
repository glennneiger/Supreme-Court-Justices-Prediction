that
was
found
by
the
district
court,
didn't
it,
in
the
district
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
find
that
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
was
clearly
erroneous
in
that
respect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wolcott
may
i
ask
you
this?
the
employment
of
mccoy
as
a
caretaker
necessitate
his
being
a
national
guard
flying
officer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
he
had
to,
suppose
he
was
able
to
get
his
efficiency
rating
through
the
reserve
corp
rather
the
national
guard,
would
that
have
been
adequate
for
the
job
as
caretaker?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
had
to
be
qualified
to
fly
as
a
military
flier,
but
did
it
require
him
to
--
his
main
employment
as
a
caretaker
does
that
necessitate
his
being
a
member
of
the
maryland
national
guard
with
flying
staff?
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
necessarily,
he
did
or
he
didn't?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
wouldn't
suffice
if
he
was
a
member
of
a
reserve
corp?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
cases
support
you
in
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
conclude
with
a
sentence
or
two.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
wouldn't
that
have
some
evidentiary
value
in
a
case
of
this
kind
or
we
do
have
sort
of
a
mixed
up
situation,
part
state
and
part
federal
ownership
and
the
federal
government
when
this
happens
recognized
clearly
and
consistently
throughout
it's
departments
that
the
man
was
a
federal
agent,
it
has
--
it
does
have
some
well
there
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mit
is
not
conclusive
but
it
does
have
some
bearings,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
know,
but
how
about
that
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
in
the
courts,
but
have
you
in
the
departments
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
mccoy
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
treatment
they
gave
mr.
mccoy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
â€“
of
the
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
includes
caretakers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
this
national
guard
was
not
recognized,
was
he
federally
recognized?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
not
--
just
not
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
notice
the
petitioner
in
this
case
contends
that
he
could
be
fired
directly
by
the
federal
government.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
fact
that
they
are
required
to
go
to
a
school
for
nine
months,
federal
school
where
they
are
paid
by
the
federal
government
in
order
to
qualify
as
a
caretaker
have
any
significance--?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
if
colonel
kilkowski
or
whomever
like
that
wanted
mccoy
to
make
a
test
flight
to
test
the
proficiency
of
the
airplane,
would
he
have
done
it
as
a
member
of
the
national
guard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
you
know
what
the
practice
was
where
you
just
made
a
test
flight,
whether
that
was
done
by
as
colonel
as
a
part
of
the
national
guard
or
whether
it
was
done
as
a
caretaker?
chief
justice
earl
warren
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren

have
completed
your
arguments.
we
gave
you

little
extra
time

response
