justice
byron
r.
white
was
he
carried
on
the
records
of
the
national
guard
as
an
employee
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
was
employed
by
two,
by
both
the
air
national
guard
and
by
the
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
someone
in
the
--
some
of
the
officers
say
that
commanding
general
or
whoever
it
was
didn't
want
to
approve
that
flight
that
day,
would
he
have
prevented
him
from
flying
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
could
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
if
colonel
had
wanted
him
to
fly
another
one
the
next
day,
could
he
have
ordered
him
to
do
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
–
if
he
had
wanted
him
to
check
out
some
equipment.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
colonel
had
wanted
him
to
check
out
a
particular
piece
of
equipment
in
a
certain
way,
he
could
have
directed
him
to
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
i’m
think
was
in
itself,
isn't
it?
that
doesn't
reach
the
--
does
a
negative
impact
as
of
the
time
he
took
off,
just
before
and
just
after,
he
took
off
the
air
national
guard
that
was
directing
his
activities
and
could
have,
could
have
ordered
him
to
land
three
seconds
after
he
took
off.
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
performing
services
of
civil
--
as
a
maintenance
technician
could
still
be
under
the
control
and
direction
of
the
guard?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
united
states
could
have
come
in
here
and
set
out
that
colonel
--
he
ordered
the
fellow
to
check
his
airplane
out
that
day,
he
ordered
you
to
do
otherwise,
they
couldn't
have
done
that,
but
to
nationalize
the
national
guard.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
act
that,
that's
324,
isn't
it,
section
324
you
are
talking
about,
his
recognition?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
not
exactly
saying
if
they
withdraw
recognition
and
somebody
else
has
to
fire
him,
the
national
guard
has
to
fire
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
it
says?
doesn't
it
require
his
discharge
if
united
states
withdrew
--
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
--
justice
byron
r.
white
–
and
the
national
guard
--
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
pursuant
to
a
general
statute
applicable
to
national
guard
officers?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
applies
to
national
guard
military?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
isn't
there
a
statute
which
expressly
says
the
compensation
provision
shall
be
applicable
to
these
people
or
not
or
is
that
just
an
administrative
interpretation?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
whatever
it
was
--
you
say
that
was
meant
to
cover
a
civilian
employee
such
as
we
have
here
as
well
as
the
military?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
hope
you
touch
on
what
theory
of
the
decisions
was
that
distinguished
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
kilkowski?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron

white
[inaudible]
justice
byron

white
[inaudible]
justice
byron

white
[inaudible]
justice
byron

white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
well
this
throws
the
--
because
they
add
the
general
functions
with
regard
to
the
civilian
personnel
different
at
all
from
the
function
regarding
the
military
personnel.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
these
courts
that
have
held
against
you
on
this
distinction
must
have
held,
saying
that
the
adjutant
general
for
example
was
acting
as
the
agent
of
the
united
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
–
certainly
for
administering
the
civilian
program.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
must
have
thought
his
position
was
different
than
say
as
agent
for
the
united
states
during
the
military
program?
