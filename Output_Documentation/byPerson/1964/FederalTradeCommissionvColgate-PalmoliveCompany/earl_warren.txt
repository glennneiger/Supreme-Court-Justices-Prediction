mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
a
good
distinction
would
be
if
they
wanted
to
show
a
mock-up
of
a
shaver
on
the
television.
it
would
be
perfectly
alright,
but
if
they
said,
“see
what
it
will
do
now”
and
then
they
have
something
that
it
doesn't
do,
then
you
would
--
then
it
would
be
a
misrepresentation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
i
meant
to
say.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sonnett.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
could
be
done
but
it
would
take
80
minutes
to
do
it.
would
you
for
one
minute
put
that
on
television
and
tell
the
public
it
could
be
done
if
it
took
80
--
but
it
take
80
minutes
to
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
just
restating
what
i
thought
mr.
heymann
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
it
still
a
part
of
the
question
as
to
whether
there
was
a
misrepresentation
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
[inaudible]
the
way
the
question
is
presented
to
us
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
or
in
the
brief.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
see
the
broadcast
but
did
it
show
the
application
of
this
cream
in
the
telecast
and
then
show
an
immediate
shaving
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
government
might
want
to
force
us
to
go
farther
than
we
have
to
go
in
the
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
do
we
have
to
go
that
far?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
did
say
they
would
press
us
to
do
it.
if
it
is
a
fact,
if
it
is
a
fact
that
the
telecast
showed
a
picture
of
the
application
of
this
cream
and
an
immediate
shaving
of
a
piece
of
sandpaper
and
it
will
not
do
that
way,
it
takes
80
minutes
or
some
--
of
soaking
and
some
other
preparation
to
get
it
to
do
that,
wouldn't
that
be
a
misrepresentation
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
–
that
we
should
have
to
take
into
effect
where
the
government
says
we
want
you
to
go
all
the
way
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
heymann,
i
