justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
[inaudible]
isn't
mr.
heymann
the
issue
before
us
is
whether
it
maybe
proper
to
misrepresent
that
an
actual
experiment
namely
shaving
sandpaper
is
being
carried
on,
on
television,
even
though
in
fact
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
you
can
shave
sandpaper
and
even
though
in
fact
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
what
is
being
shown
as
shaving
sandpaper
accurately
portrays
what
happens
when
you
shave
sandpaper.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
only
--
our
only
proposition,
the
only
thing
we
have
to
decide
is
as
to
the
scope
of
the
order
whether
or
not
an
advertiser
may
have
it
appear
that
he
is
shaving
sandpaper
even
though
he
is
not,
although
he
could
shave?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
assumed
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
as
i
gather
that
he
can
shave
sandpaper.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
assume
for
the
purpose
that
we
can.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet
there
is
no
misrepresentation
of
the
quality
the
product.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
wouldn't
take
80
minutes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
sonnett
if
you
please,
may
i
just
add,
i'm
looking
at
pages
93
to
95
which
i
understand
--
of
the
record,
which
i
understand
is
the
final
order,
third
and
final
order
and
all
that
we
have
involved,
am
i
correct
about
this,
is
the
provision
of
paragraph
1,
neither
2,
3,
4,
or
5
of
that
order.
when
i
say
two,
three,
four,
five
i
mean
roman
numerals,
no
problem
under
those
sections
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
want
to
take
your
time,
but
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
which
provisions
of
this
order
are
before
us.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
want.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
i
need
not
to
bother
you
any
more.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you're
referring
to
would
make
a
big
difference.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
this
is
almost
implicit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
think
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
don't
you
have
to
say
that
if
you
made
the
affirmative
representation
that
this
is
not
a
substitute,
that
you're
nevertheless
home
free?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
mean,
is
--
this
pre-recorded,
is
that
the
result
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
i
gather
what
you're
in
substance
saying
is
that
if
you
did
this
on
radio
and
you
announced
we've
made
an
experiment
with
shaving
sandpaper
and
we
found
that
it
works
and
this
is
good
enough
to
shave
sandpaper,
there
would
be
no
question
that
you
could
do
that
and
you're
saying
doing
it
this
way
is
only
doing
the
same
thing
except
you
have
a
peculiar
problem
in
the
medium
of
television,
namely
that
you
can't
put
on
the
actually
what
is
done,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
violated
the
act
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wish
you'd
just
make
that
clear.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
short
of
why
the
use
of
this
possible
remedy
for
what
you're
talking
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
suppose
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
would
be
the
other
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
would
be
the
other
court?[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
is
not
an
actual
test,
that's
all.
