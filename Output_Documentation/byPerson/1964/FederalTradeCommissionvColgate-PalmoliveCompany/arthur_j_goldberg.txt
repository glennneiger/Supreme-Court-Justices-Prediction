justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
why
did
the
government
have
this
argued
as
to
whether
they
could
shave
sandpaper
in
the
question
presented
by
the
petitioner?
you
would
assume
that
you
could.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
so
we
have
to
assume
for
this
case
that
they
could
shave
sandpaper.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
am
i
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
why
do
have
that
in
this
case?
isn't
that
an
abstract
proposition
because
with
the
matter
it
does,
the
commission
responds
that
that
is
a
false
claim.
now
what
we
have
to
confirm
here
is
an
abstract
question
is
wrong?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well
you're
going
to
cover
that
in
your
argument.

[laughter]
justice
arthur
j.

[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
in
light
of
the
difficulties
of
the
administration?
justice

justice
arthur
j.

[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
why
couldn't
you
ask
him
what's
the
difficulty
with
adding
a
very
simple
statement?
this
is
a
reproduction
of
an
actual
test
which
has
been
conducted.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
think
something
[inaudible].
this
is
a
reproduction
of
an
actual
test
which
has
been
conducted.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
and
i
thought
and
i
think
you
have
straightened
this
out.
i
thought
the
assumption
was,
now
this
case
as
mentioned
and
the
reproduction
of
exactly
the
same
at
the
same
time
that
all
[inaudible]
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
because
i
take
it
is
clearly
a
deceptive
practice
to
misrepresent
the
timing?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
that
this
is
an
actual
test
and
you're
saying
that
that
is
a
misrepresentation
and
because
what
should
be
said
is
that
this
is
a
simulated
but
accurate
reproduction
of
an
actual
test.
