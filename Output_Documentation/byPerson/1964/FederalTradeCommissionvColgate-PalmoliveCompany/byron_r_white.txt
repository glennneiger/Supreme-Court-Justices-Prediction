justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
you
--
i
take
it
then,
or
do
you
deny
that
there
are
two
misrepresentations
involved?
let's
assume
that
the
stand
--
that
your
first
one
is
a
misrepresentation,
well
the
stand
that
you
can
really
shave
sandpaper.
we
get
the
–
do
you
say
there's
a
misrepresentation
at
all
about
what
you're
showing?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
–
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that,
but
the
viewer
is
expected
to
think
he
is
seeing
an
actual
proof
of
the
claim.
he
thinks
that
here
is
a
razor
shaving
sandpaper
and
you
intend
him
to
think
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
false.
it
is
a
misrepresentation.
you
say
this
is
material,
is
that
your
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
misrepresentation
but
not
material
--
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
can
it
ever
be,
can
it
ever
be
as
long
as
the
representation
is
true
about
the
charges
to
the
product
and
even
i
suppose,
even
if
you
say
that
you're
actually
proving
it
by
an
actual
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
you
say
that's
the
question
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
ever.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
you
say
that
we're
not
using
a
substitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
this
is
an
ever
question
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
for
heaven
sake?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
appears
it's
not
saying
anything,
it
means
to
most
people
that
you're
saying
affirmatively
that,
i
suppose
we
must
reach
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
have
a
studio
full
of
people
watching
a
certain
program
and
you're
in
front
of
the
television,
for
the
studio,
the
people
who
are
there,
you
actually
use
sandpaper
and
then
shave
sandpaper
and
it
is
an
actual
representation
in
the
quality
of
your
product.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
just
across
the
stage,
the
commercial
on
television,
uses
the
mock-up,
it
doesn't
have
to.
it's
like
if
you
say
if
they
are
showing
a
sports
car
that
can
go
up
a
20%
grade
on
the
side
of
the
mountain.
instead
of
taking
a
picture
of
the
outside,
they
use
a
model,
using
a
small
car
going
up
the
mountain
right
in
the
studio.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
sonnett,
why
isn't
this
just
an
abstract
question
here
because
you're
not
--
you
violated
the
act,
the
sand
--
you're
not
going
to
be
using
sandpaper
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
isn't
it
just
an
abstract
question
here
in
this
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
advertisement
is
out
of
business.
i
mean
this
particular
commercial
is
just
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
didn't
bring
the
case
here;
you
were
satisfied
with
the
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
with
a
mock-up
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
heymann,
half
the
trouble
is
that
the
commission
and
you
in
the
argument
here
have
not
indicated
what
is
necessary,
perhaps
you
say,
i
don't
have
to
say.
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
necessary
to
cure
what
you
call
is
a
misrepresentation?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
a
lot
of
these
questions
go
to.
you
say
the
misrepresentation
is
wrong
and
yet
you
don't
object
to
the
use
of
mock-up.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
obviously
is
not
just
to
refrain
from
saying
it
is
an
actual
test
and
just
be
silent.
if
you're
just
silent,
most
people
will
probably
think
that
you're
doing
an
actual
test,
so
you're
going
to
have
to
say
something
affirmative.
