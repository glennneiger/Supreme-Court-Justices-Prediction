justice
hugo
l.

well,
why
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
you'd
have
to
say
would
be
this
is
not
real
sandpaper.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
say
because,
if
you
just
want
to
tell
the
truth,
why
should
they
want
to
leave
the
impression,
now
i
certainly
would
be
left
with
the
impression
if
i
saw
this
advertisement
that
they
are
actually
shaving
real
sandpaper.
well,
why
do
they
want
to
leave
that
such
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
impression
on
the
public.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
you
can,
you're
trying
to
impress
them
that
you
can
shave
it.
as
i
understood
it,
you
can't,
but
suppose
you
can,
you're
leaving
the
impression
with
them
that
this
shaving
cream
is
so
wonderful
in
some
respect,
so
miraculous
that
it
kind
of
moistens
the
sandpaper
and
makes
it
disappear
from
sight
and
makes
it
easy
to
move.
now
why
does
an
advertiser
want
to
do
that
if
he
simply
wants
to
tell
the
truth?
justice
hugo
l.
black
assume
it
can,
assume
it
can,
why
on
this
--
why
in
this
note
that
you
just
referred
us
to
absolutely
sound
and
that
the
reader,
the
man
who
is
going
to
be
impressed
is
being
led
to
believe
that
it
does
just
in
this
fashion
when
you
put
it
on
just
like
he's
put
it
on
there
before
his
eyes
and
why
would
an
honest
businessman
want
to
deceive
the
public
in
that
fashion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
be
if
i
saw
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
wouldn't
go
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
seen
it
on
the
television.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
the
advertiser
is
supposed
to
be
doing
is
doing
somewhere
within
the
reasonable
range
of
a
truthful
representation
so
that
the
public
will
not
be
deceived.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
it
actually
performed,
can
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
it
actually
be
performed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
you
have
is
you're
saying
because
it
can
actually
be
performed
in
the
longer
time,
you
can
let
the
public
look
at
the
television
which
is
all
it
can
look
at
and
leave
the
impression
that
it
can
do
it
in
the
time
you
were
looking
at
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
no,
i'm
not
say
that
you're
defending
them,
but
i'm
trying
to
get
back
to
the
principle
that
the
court
long
ago
said
that
you
must
take
the
most
incredulous
person
that's
looking
at
that
advertisement
and
not
try
to
deceive
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
where
we
differ
--
where
we
differ
here
is
that
i
don't
think
its
telling
the
truth
because
to
me
what
the
television
is
saying
is
that
we
assure
you
right
here,
we
take
this
sandpaper
before
your
eyes,
we
put
this
thing
on
it,
it
moistened
it
and
then
it
shaves
beautifully
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
â€“
and
that's
not
the
truth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
could,
suppose
it
could.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
let's
assume
now
that
as
you
say
it
has
been
said,
they
can
do
this,
when
we
know
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
can't
do
it
and
let's
assume
that,
but
that
is
a
fact
because
you
said
they
can't
do
it
in
the
time
and
as
shown
on
this
place.
now
why
shouldn't
the
commission
if
it
orders
you
to
stop
making
the
misrepresentation
which
you
say
it's
alright
to
do,
why
shouldn't
it
go
far
enough
to
protect
the
public
from
ingenious
substitutes
designed
to
accomplish
the
same
purpose
that
they
have
just
forbidden
above?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
all
i
see
that
number
one
does.
