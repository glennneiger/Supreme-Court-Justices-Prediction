what
effect
do
you
think
it
would
have
on
the
viewing
public
if
there
is
a
short
announcement,
simply
saying
we're
using
a

[inaudible]
to
the
announcements
that
are
made
on
a
television
program
or
a
radio
program
comes
out,
this
is
recorded
and
not
a
live
production?

would
be
--
justice

but
you
are
trying
to
stop
mock-ups,
the
use
of

any
proof
of
that
in
the
record?
justice

maybe
we
wait
for
a
case
where
this
issue
is
really
presented
as
you
suggested.
