justice
potter
stewart
that's
out
of
the
case.
justice
potter
stewart
now
here,
we're
proceeding
on
a
hypothesis
which
is
contrary
to
facts,
but
we're
proceeding
on
the
hypothesis
that
rapid
shave
could
cause
a
razor
to
shave
sandpaper.
justice
potter
stewart
right
and
we're
assuming
the
claim
is
true,
although
we
know
as
a
matter
of
fact
it's
not.
justice
potter
stewart
right
and
then
therefore,
we
by
hypothesis
assume
it's
true.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
the
fact
that
the
sandpaper
does
not
and
cannot
be
made
to
look
like
sandpaper
on
television
is
a
very
relevant
fact,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
but
it
is
relevant,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
claim
that
we
can't
do
it
because
sandpaper
doesn't
look
sandpaper.
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
take
up
the
whole
commercial.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
you're
f.t.c.
claims
so
far
as
to
do
is
to
restrain
them
however
from
using
something
which
is
not
in
fact
shaving
sandpaper,
but
gives
the
appearance
that
it
is
shaving
sandpaper.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
this
white
shirt
fits
around
the
neck
perfectly.
actually,
it's
not
a
white
shirt,
it's
a
blue
shirt,
but
it
has
to
be
blue
in
order
to
show
up
white
on
television,
what
then?
justice
potter
stewart
how
can
you
distinguish
that
from
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
i
can't
think
of
a
worse
way
to
make
something
look
attractive
than
having
it
appear
that
you
can
shave
things
like
sandpaper.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
one
buyer
that
does
get
effected.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
the
real
product
looked
very,
very
much
better
because
of
the
non-television.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
definitely
better.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
of
course.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
well
it
is
a
picture
of
the
cream
coming
right
into
the
living
room.
justice
potter
stewart
not
that
they
should,
they
have
to.
justice
potter
stewart
or
i
suppose
they
could
if
with
one
of
these
explanations
that
you
have.
say
this
is
the
picture
of
the
actual
product,
but
the
television
makes
it
look
better
than
it
really
is.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
sure
then
that
i
understand
the
definition
of
a
mock-up.
how
can
a
person
be
smoking
a
cigarette
be
a
mock-up?
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
they
use
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
does
mock-up
mean?
that's
my
real
question.
justice
potter
stewart
what
does
it
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
a
violation.
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
a
violation
in
this
case
and
it's
been
held
so
and
you
concede
that
that
is
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
the
commission
went
much
further
than
that?
justice
potter
stewart
now
whether
or
not
that
would
be
permissible.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no.
justice
potter
stewart
what
justice
goldberg
read
wouldn't
be
truth?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
reproduction
of
an
actual
test.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
nor
would
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
an
actual
test,
it's
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
here,
it
was
false,
concededly
false.
there
was
a
conceded
violation.
justice
potter
stewart
it
could
not
be
an
actual
commercial
i'm
sure.[laughter]
