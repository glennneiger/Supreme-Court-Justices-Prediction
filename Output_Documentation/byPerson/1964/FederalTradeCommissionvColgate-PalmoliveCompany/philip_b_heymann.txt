mr.
philip
b.
heymann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
discuss
in
this
federal
trade
commission
case,
first,
the
merits,
returning
only
if
there
is
time
to
the
question
of
compliance
with
the
mandate.
that
will
very
much
simplify
the
statement
of
facts.
late
in
1959,
over
five
years
ago,
the
respondents
created
and
disseminated
over
network
television,
three
commercials
for
colgate-palmolive's
product
rapid
shave.
each
of
them
showed
what
the
respondents
called
a
“sandpaper
test”
which
again
in
the
respondent's
words
was
said
to
prove
the
super-moisturizing
power
of
rapid
shave.
the
test
showed
someone
spreading
lather
on
a
rather
coarse
piece
of
sandpaper
and
then
immediately
shaving
a
clean
path
through
the
lather
and
the
sand.
after
viewing
the
commercials,
the
commission
found
specifically
that
each
represented
that
buyers
were
being
given
visual
experimental
proof
of
the
truth
of
the
words
the
seller
were
saying,
the
truth
of
the
seller's
claims.
in
fact,
the
sandpaper
test
was
not
a
test
at
all.
the
respondents
had
sprinkled
sand
on
the
piece
of
plexiglass
which
had
some
mildly
adhesive
liquid
spread
over
it
and
shaved
a
clean
path
through
the
loose
sand.
a
rather
colorful
set
of
test
conducted
before
the
hearing
examiner,
proved
conclusively
that
no
comparable
piece
of
sandpaper
could
be
shaved
in
seconds,
minutes
or
even
after
an
hour.
finally,
they
came
up
with
a
piece
of
sandpaper
that
seemed
to
be
roughly
comparable,
it
was
shaved
after
80
minutes.
on
the
basis
of
these
facts,
the
commission
found
that
respondents
had
engaged
in
two
misrepresentations.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
the
sandpaper
on
the
undisputed
record
would
not
look
like
sandpaper
on
television,
if
that's
what
you
mean
your
honor.
sandpaper
would
not
look
like
sandpaper
on
television.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
actual
sandpaper
--
i
am
in
no
position
to
contest
actual
sandpaper
would
not
appear
like
sandpaper
on
television.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
that
justice
douglas
is
certainly
true
too,
but
even
if
they
could
have
done
it,
if
there
were
no
--
there
was
some
talk
about
why
didn't
they
use
sandpaper.
well,
i
don't
know
how
you
go
into
motivations
like
this.
there
was
a
very
good
reason
for
not
using
sandpaper,
they
couldn't
do
it.
even
if
they
could
have
done
it,
they
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
show
a
visual
experiment
involving
sandpaper.
they
would
have
had
to
say,
what
you're
watching
is
a
dramatic
reenactment
of
tests
actually
performed
under
laboratory
conditions.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
don't
think
it
is
relevant
in
this
argument
whether
they
could
shave
sandpaper.
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
that
it
is
irrelevant.
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
that
the
possibility
of
false
claims
is
irrelevant
to
the
issue
before
the
court,
but
whether
these
respondents
could
shave
sandpaper
is
not
relevant
to
this
case.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
yes.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
yes.
you
do
not
have
to
assume
that
every
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
no,
they're
certainly
not
your
honor.
the
commission
found
there
were
two
misrepresentations.
first
of
course
a
misrepresentation
about
what
rapid
shave
could
do.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
that's
out
of
the
case,
that's
been
decided.
second
of
all,
a
misrepresentation
that
the
respondents
had
furnished
visual
proof
of
the
truth
of
their
claims.
now
the
second
misrepresentation
was
also
made
the
basis
for
the
commission
order.
the
commission
order
had
two
paragraphs
i
should
say.
it's
one
order
with
two
paragraphs.
the
order
is
of
course
before
this
court.
now
there
would
be
one
way
in
which
you
could
say
that
this
is
an
abstract
case.
if
an
order
forbidding
shaving
--
misrepresentations
about
shaving
cream
was
adequate
to
cover
the
harms
of
misrepresentations
that
you're
furnishing
proof
of
the
truth
of
a
claim,
then
there
would
be
no
reason
to
enter
both
of
them,
one
would
do.
but
if
it
isn't
adequate,
then
you
should
have
both
paragraphs
of
the
order,
and
my
argument
is
that
it
very
plainly
is
not
adequate.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
most
certainly
intend
to.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well,
i
don't
know
whether
it
helps
to
think
of
it
your
honor.
the
question,
the
commission
believes
that
there
were
two
misrepresentations
made
in
this
case,
just
as
if
they
had
said
rapid
shave
can
shave
sandpaper
and
can
also
shave
fur.
you
have
an
order
against
both
of
them,
or
rapid
shave
can
shave
sandpaper
and
some
other
product
can
do
something
else
and
we
want
to
reach
both
misrepresentations.
if
there's
any
--
if
one
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
think
that's
a
fair
way
of
putting
it.
you
can
simply
say
the
question
before
this
court
is,
is
there
something
independently
wrong
with
misrepresenting
that
you're
giving
proof
of
the
truth
to
your
claims.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
the
falsity
of
the
claim
is
irrelevant
to
this
case.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
assume
it's
true.
i'm
quite
prepared
to
take
that.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well,
i
would
like
to
argue
that
your
honor.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
don't
think
it's
particularly
relevant.
it's
true.
no,
it's
something
that
should
be
kept
in
mind.
i
don't
mean
it's
not
relevant
in
the
sense
that
it
shouldn't
be
kept
in
mind.
i
don't
think
that
sandpaper
--
the
fact
that
sandpaper
doesn't
look
like
sandpaper
on
television,
is
any
justification
for
saying
what
you're
seeing
on
television
is
sandpaper.
it's
justification
for
saying,
we're
about
to
show
a
dramatic
reenactment
of
tests
that
were
actually
done.
it's
not
adequate
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
explain
that.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
don't
think
it
is
remotely
necessary
your
honor.
i
think
you
can
simply
say,
“oh,
it's
been
done
elsewhere,”
but
it
--
under
--
we're
showing
you
a
reenactment
of
tests
we've
done
under
actual
laboratory
conditions.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
that's
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
whether
he
can
say
he's
proving
the
truth
of
this
claim
that
he
can
shave
sandpaper
when
he's
not.
i
might
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
that's
correct,
now
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
not
from
using
it,
simply
from
using
it
and
adding
to
that
use
a
representation
that
he
is
providing
visual
proof
of
the
truth
of
his
claims.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
it's
exactly
the
same
in
our
mind
as
if
he
had
said,
we
can
shave
sandpaper
and
the
hyman
testing
agency
has
checked
the
truth
of
this
claim
and
certifies
it's
correct.
we
would
say
that
it's
a
unfair
and
deceptive
trade
practice
to
say
falsely
that
the
hyman
testing
agency
has
tested
it,
regardless
of
the
truth
of
the
claim.
that's
the
heart
of
our
case.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
we
say
a
lie
about
the
basis
for
belief
is
material.
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
--
i'd
like
to
get
on
with
my
argument,
i'm
afraid
my
time
is
running
very
quickly.
we
believe
this
case
turns
on
a
single
proposition
and
i
think
this
proposition
is
100%
provable.
the
commission
has
not
forbidden
the
use
of
mock-ups
or
props.
it
has
forbidden
misrepresentations
that
a
seller
is
furnishing
proof
of
the
truth
of
his
claims.
the
commission
recognizes
that
the
means
of
making
claims
is
a
matter
of
indifference
to
buyers.
it
does
say
that
representations
that
go
to
the
basis
the
buyer
has
for
believing
in
the
truth
of
what
a
seller
says
is
material.
we
don't
care
whether
that
misrepresentation
is
made
by
means
of
mock-ups
or
any
other
way.
it's
--
the
commission
order
at
page
6
does
not
forbid
mock-ups,
page
6
of
our
brief.
the
court
would
like
to
delete
all
reference
to
mock-ups,
we'd
be
delighted.
the
respondents
will
object
because
it
will
broaden
the
order.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
there's
no
representation
of
proof,
perfectly
all
right
to
use
it.
no
representation
that
you're
showing
it
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
what
we're
talking
about,
your
honor,
is
the
class,
which
is
an
immense
class
of
skeptical
buyers
who
tend
to
believe
that
sellers
exaggerate
the
qualities
of
their
claims
who
tend
to
suspect
sellers
claims
because
sellers
exaggerate,
because
sellers
have
the
greatest
interest
in
making
their
product
look
as
attractive
as
possible.
if
one
of
those
buyers
sees
an
ad
on
television
where
a
man
is
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well
--[laughter]
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
one
of
the
hardest
problems
in
the
case
has
fortunately
been
eliminated,
and
that
is
whether
anyone
would
buy
rapid
shave
because
it
can
shave
sandpaper,
which
finally
resolved
on
the
basis
that
if
the
sellers
thought
so,
they
know
more
about
it
than
we
do.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
your
honor,
i
think
it's
an
excellent
mock-up.
i
think
it
should
be
shown
on
television
tomorrow.
i
have
no
objection.
the
commission
would
have
no
objection
to
it.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
no
one
would
look
at
that
picture
and
say
they
were
seeing
experimental
proof
of
a
claim
for
rope.
it's
an
obvious
drawing.
i
don't
know
why
bates
puts
it
in.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i'm
interested
in
knowing
your
honor
whether
it
looks
like
they're
drawing.
their
drawing
doesn't
look
like
a
real
thing
to
me
and
it
doesn't
look
like
a
real
thing
to
anybody.
it
looks
like
a
drawing.
if
they
make
a
detailed
paper
mache
machine,
and
they
say
to
the
viewers,
“look,
lots
of
people
claim
that
their
rope
can
withstand
6,000
pounds
of
pull.”
but
you
know
sellers.
sellers
exaggerate.
we'll
prove
to
you
the
truth
of
our
claim.
there's
something
you
can
act
on,
our
proof.
watch
this
test
performed
under
--
performed
with
a
machine
before
your
very
eyes.
they
do
that
with
the
mock-up,
that's
material,
it's
false,
and
it's
unfair
to
competitors.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there's
anyone
in
the
country
who
believes
that's
a
stomach
it's
going
to.[laughter]
i'm
afraid
i'm
doing
better
as
a
comedian
than
getting
my
argument
out
and
i
think
i'd
better
proceed.
the
heart
of
the
commission's
argument
can
be
stated
very
simply.
i'm
going
to
arbitrarily
state
it
in
four
steps,
they
could
be
condensed,
they
could
be
expanded.
the
commission
believes
the
act
has
always
been
read
as
forbidding
all
material
misrepresentations.
by
that,
we
mean
all
misrepresentations,
calculated
or
intended
to
influence
the
purchasing
decision
of
buyers.
that's
the
language
that's
always
been
used.
i
had
quotes,
but
i'll
skip
them
now.
we
know
of
no
exception
in
the
hundreds
of
cases
that
have
come
before
the
federal
trade
commission,
the
respondents
have
pointed
to
none,
the
evidence
in
history
and
in
earlier
cases
are
overwhelming.
i
don't
understand
the
respondents
to
really
question
this
proposition.
the
act
forbids
all
represent
--
misrepresentations
intended
to
influence
the
decisions
of
buyers.
one
factor
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
your
honor,
i
think
that's
a
red
herring
that's
always
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
it's
always
--
i
think
that's
always
been
a
red
herring
and
i've
never
bothered
to
answer
it,
i'm
glad
you
asked.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
if
they
have
a
product,
judge
aldridge
asked,
what
if
they
have
a
cream
that
looks
better
on
television.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well
of
course
they
should
use
a
mock-up
of
it,
in
talking
about
the
creaming
and
in
showing
it.
they
should
use
a
mock-up
because
they
shouldn't
fool
people
into
thinking
the
cream
looks
better
than
it
does,
but
they
can't
say
by
definition
of
the
hypothetical.
they
can't
say
lots
of
people
claim
they
have
good
looking
creams.
we
can
prove
to
you.
we
can
separate
our
claim
out
from
the
ordinary
exaggerated
puff
of
claims
of
other
people.
we
can
separate
out
--
we'll
prove
to
you
what
our
cream
looks
like.
here's
a
picture
of
it
directly
on
television,
coming
right
from
the
studio
into
your
living
room.
they
can't
say
that
because
by
definition
it's
false.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well,
they
can't
say
that
because
it
exaggerates
the
--
because
it
makes
the
cream
look
better
than
it
does.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
they
can't
say
television
accurately
transmits
the
picture
of
our
cream
when
it
doesn't.
but
they
can
of
course
they
should
use
a
mock-up
in
advertising
their
cream
and
showing
people
drinking
that
or
what
have
you.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
they
have
to.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well
–
i
think
--
your
honor,
to
talk
about
it,
giving
an
explanation
whenever
you
show
a
product
in
an
ad
makes
the
situation
ridiculous.
you
can't
give
an
explanation
whenever
you
show
a
mock-up.
this
case
isn't
about
mock-ups.
it's
about
3%
of
the
ads
on
television
or
1%
or
one-third
of
1%,
those
which
say
we're
giving
proof.
now
all
we're
saying
is
in
that
tiny
category
of
ads;
they
should
really
be
giving
proof.
and
if
they
want
to
put
on
a
test,
if
they
want
to
illustrate
proofs
they've
done
elsewhere,
in
that
tiny
category
they
should
say,
“we're
showing
you
a
reenactment
of
tests
we've
done
elsewhere.”
not
whenever
--
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
use
of
mock-ups
in
95%
of
ads
on
television.
people
smoking
cigarettes,
drinking
coca-cola,
drinking
beer,
eating
ice
cream,
all
of
those
can
be
mock-ups.
none
of
them
involved
a
representation
that
an
experiment
or
test
furnishes
visual
proof
of
the
truth
of
a
claim.
that's
what
the
commission
order
says,
that's
what
its
reasoning
says.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well,
apparently
they
don't
use
real
cigarettes
frequently.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
don't
know.[laughter]
let's
pass
that.
i
meant
that
my
example
involved
the
hypothesis
that
they
weren't
using
a
real
cigarette.
of
course,
if
my
hypothesis
is
wrong,
pass
it.
they
don't
drink
real
beer
because
their
head
would
disappear
under
the
camera
lights.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
it
means,
it's
a
word
that's
been
created
as
far
as
i
know
by
this
case.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
it
means
a
prop
that
is
substituted
for
something
else.
it
means
a
piece
of
paper
mache
or
cardboard
or
something
else
that
is
substituted
for
the
real
product,
or
it
can
be
--
it
means
a
substitute.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i'm
afraid
we
go
further
than
that,
your
honor.
if
they
say,
“we're
going
to
prove
to
you
what
it
can
do
by
showing
it
to
you
before
your
very
eyes”,
they
have
to
be
showing
it
to
you
before
your
very
eyes,
even
if
it
can
do
it.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
yes,
your
honor.
that's
exactly
right.
i
was
trying
to
get
out
the
four
steps
--
it
seems
to
be
when
you
realize
that
this
case
is
not
about
mock-ups,
but
about
misrepresentations
of
proof,
it
fits
so
squarely,
so
snuggly
within
established
principles,
that
i'd
like
to
see
the
respondents
take
it
out
on
--
when
they
get
up.
the
act
forbids
all
misrepresentations
calculated
to
induce
purchasers
to
act
in
some
way
or
another.
it's
almost
by
definition
of
the
statute.
the
basis
purchasers
have
for
believing
the
truth
of
a
claim
is
such
a
misrepresentation.
now,
if
a
seller
says,
“my
product
can
do
x
and
y
and
a
testing
agency
has
checked
it
and
certifies
it”,
he
has
to
be
telling
the
truth
when
he
says
a
testing
agency
has
checked
it
and
certified
it.
this
is
material
to
buyers.
i
don't
understand
the
respondents
to
question
this.
all
the
questions
the
court
has
asked
this
morning
can
apply
equally
to
that.
the
product
may
be
able
to
do
it,
but
if
he's
going
to
tell
buyers,
“you
can
rely
on
the
truth
of
my
words
because
a
testing
agency
has
checked
it”,
that
has
to
be
true
too.
if
he
says,
“you
can
rely
on
my
words
because
i'm
a
minister”
and
that
has
to
be
true
too,
even
though
the
product
maybe
able
to
do
exactly
what
it
wants.
you
can't
require
competitors
to
go
around
saying
--
you
can't
require
them
to
choose
between
losing
sales
and
bolstering
their
true
claims
if
you
want
with
representations
that
they
had
been
checked,
misrepresentations
they
had
been
checked
by
testing
agencies
or
that
the
seller
is
a
minister
or
some
other
form
of
clergymen.
we
say
that
an
experimental
proof
on
television,
the
sponsor
says,
“you're
seeing
--
we'll
give
you
visual
proof
of
the
truth
for
claim
it's
exactly
the
same
as
a
certification
of
a
testing
agency
or
any
other
misrepresentation
that
goes
to
the
basis
for
the
buyer's
belief.”
it
makes
no
difference
if
the
seller
says,
“my
glue
can
hold
500
pounds
per
square
inch”
or
if
he
says,
“and
i'll
prove
it
by
a
testing
agency”,
or
if
he
says,
“i'll
prove
it
by
showing
you
an
experiment
on
television.”
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
your
honor,
the
very
purpose
of
showing
a
mock-up
of
ice
cream,
it's
easier
to
think
of
it
in
terms
of
a
magazine
ad.
there's
a
magazine
ad
for
ice
cream
and
there's
a
delicious
looking
piece
of
ice
cream
and
it
says,
“eat
sealtest
ice
cream.”
the
purpose
of
it
is
to
cause
someone's
mouth
to
water
and
someone
to
say,
“let's
go
out
and
get
sealtest
ice
cream.”
a
skeptical
buyer
will
not
look
at
that
ad
and
think
he
has
anything
better
than
the
seller's
words
to
bolster
--
he
has
anything
better
than
a
seller's
word
to
go
on.
the
seller's
word
may
make
his
mouth
water,
he
may
feel
like
taking
a
fling,
that's
what
advertisers
want
buyers
to
do,
go
out
and
take
a
fling.
if
you
show
him
a
test
and
you
say
to
him,
“my
product
can
shave
sandpaper
and
i'll
prove
it
by
showing
you
a
test
where
sandpaper
is
shave
before
you
very
eyes,
the
skeptical
buyer
is
told
specifically,
lay
aside
your
doubts,
you're
seeing
the
real
thing.
this
isn't
a
visual
portrayal
of
the
buyers
--
of
the
seller's
claims.
this
is
it.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
talk
about
the
harms
for
a
minute,
your
honor.
some
of
the
harms
are
obvious.
they
are
the
harms
that
always
characterize
any
material
misrepresentation
and
justify
the
breadth
of
the
rule.
purchases
are
by
definition
tricked
into
making
purchases.
many
people
don't
like
to
be
tricked
into
doing
things.
the
trick
maybe
costly.
purchaser
may
pay
more,
because
he
thinks
he's
seen
the
product
proved.
i'll
pay
more
for
a
product
if
i
believe
it's
been
proved
to
me.
he
may
switch
from
rapid
shave
to
rise
or
from
rise
to
rapid
shave,
because
he's
seen
the
product
--
the
qualities
of
the
product
proven,
he
has
something
better
to
go
on
than
the
seller's
words.
that
one
cuts
right
over
to
what's
been
the
traditional,
the
thing
most
traditional
in
the
federal
trade
commission.
protection
of
competitors
against
being
required
to
do
things
which
people
regard
as
repugnant,
morally
repugnant.
tricking
other
people
into
acting,
into
spending
their
money
is
generally
regarded
this
way.
i
was
going
to
quote
from
the
kepple
decision,
justice
stone,
i
think
i'd
like
too.
a
trader
may
not
by
pursuing
a
dishonest
practice,
force
his
competitors
to
choose
between
its
adoption
and
the
loss
of
their
trade.
a
method
of
competition
which
casts
upon
one's
competitors
the
burden
of
the
loss
of
business,
unless
they
will
descend
to
a
practice
which
they
are
under
a
powerful,
moral
compulsion
not
to
adopt
even
though
it
is
not
a
criminal,
will
stop
to
involve
the
kind
of
unfairness
at
which
the
statue
was
aimed.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
your
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
your
honor,
the
fact
of
matter
is,
i
want
to
go
further
into
that,
but
the
fact
to
matter
is
that
they
can't
prove
it,
and
that's
exactly
what
they're
saying
they
are
doing.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
maybe
they
could
and
maybe
they
couldn't
and
that
presents
the
question
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
mean
in
general.
i
--
that's
what
i
answered
justice
stewart
in
the
first
place.
let
me
respond,
i'm
afraid
in
a
way
that
will
take
ten
sentences.
i
haven't
even
mentioned
what
we
regard
as
the
most
important
harm
in
this
case.
advertising
should
be
a
means
of
communication
between
sellers
and
buyers.
it's
at
best
an
uncertain
means.
there
are
two
sources
of
uncertainty.
only
the
minor
source,
only
the
less
important
source
is
the
possibility
that
the
seller
maybe
a
scrounger
who
cares
not
a
wit
about
the
truth
and
will
lie
freely.
the
major
source,
the
most
--
the
most
important
source
is
that
sellers
have
the
greatest
interest
in
making
their
product
look
attractive,
that's
how
you
sell
it
and
they
will
exaggerate
and
they
will
pop
within
the
realm
of
what
they
regard
as
substantially
true.
buyers
have
the
greatest
interest
in
knowing
just
what
the
product
can
do,
not
receiving
a
puffed
ad
within
the
realm
of
what
the
seller
regards
--
within
the
limits
that
the
seller
regards
as
substantially
true.
we
know
of
only
one
way
that
a
seller
can
tell
buyers
that
he
is
receiving
the
real
thing.
only
one
way
he
can
say
this
is
a
no
puffing
ad.
this
is
an
ad
better
than
one
that
the
commission
will
check
three
years
from
now
and
find
out
if
it
--
if
they
regard
it
as
material.
this
is
an
ad
--
only
one
way
they
can
say,
“here's
an
ad
that
you
can
judge
for
yourself
if
the
variations
are
material
and
here's
an
ad
where
you
don't
have
to
wait
three
years.”
and
that
is
for
the
seller
to
say,
“we
will
show
you
on
television
the
very
product,
doing
the
very
thing
we
can
claim
for
it
--
we
claim
for
it.”
and
that's
what
they
do
in
this
case.
this
avenue
of
communication,
the
only
possibility
of
sellers
giving
buyers
the
specific
truth
and
of
eliminating
the
uncertainty
that
pervades
advertising,
the
uncertainty
of
exaggeration
is
eliminated
if
the
commission
cannot
forbid
misrepresentations
that
you're
furnishing
proof
when
you're
not.
now
that's
why
i
said,
i
didn't
know
--
i
don't
know
whether
the
product
can
do
it
or
not.
in
some
cases,
the
seller
will
guess
wrong.
i'm
just
assuming
that
he's
going
to
use
his
best
judgment
to
keep
within
the
limits
of
substantial
truth.
in
some
cases,
you'll
guess
wrong
and
others
you
won't.
in
all
cases,
there
will
be
a
variation
and
the
buyer
will
think
he's
seeing
the
very
thing.
i
want
--
for
two
minutes
to
address
myself
to
what
i
regard
as
the
respondent's
answer
to
our
contention
that
there
is
no
justification
from
falsely
representing
that
you're
giving
proof
when
you're
not.
the
seller
seems
to
say
that
when
they
put
a
test
on
television,
they're
not
saying
that
they're
proving
the
truth
of
the
claim.
they're
simply
saying,
here's
a
test
that
we've
done
and
you
can
do.
to
that
we
have
three
answers.
first,
the
commission
has
found
otherwise
after
viewing
the
commercials
and
the
commission's
judgment
on
the
nature
of
misrepresentations
is
entitled
to
the
greatest
deference.
second
and
more
important,
i
think
the
commission
was
plainly
correct.
when
a
seller
says
to
a
buyer,
“i'll
prove
the
truth
of
my
claims,”
he
says
“i'll
give
you
independent
evidence
of
the
honesty
and
accuracy
of
what
i'm
saying.”
that's
what
proof
mean
for
anybody.
it
means
giving
evidence
that
will
compel
belief.
that's
what
webster
says,
it's
especially
true
in
sellers
and
buyers.
if
i
--
and
this
is
what
they
said
in
this
case,
we
will
give
you
evidence
to
prove
the
truth
of
our
claims.
if
i
may
use
two
analogies,
if
i
were
to
say
to
this
court,
i
can
kick
a
football
50
yards
and
i'll
prove
it.
and
then
i
showed
a
movie
of
a
football
being
kicked
50
yards,
i
think
every
justice
on
this
court
would
believe
that
he
was
seeing
me
kick
the
football
50
yards,
not
an
accurate
portrayal.
well
the
claim
has
a
certain
implausibility
about
it,
but
not
an
accurate
portrayal
of
the
claim
using
substitutes.
if
a
seller
says
--
if
a
seller
of
a
cleaning
fluid
says
that
his
claim
can
remove
heavy
grease
stains
immediately
and
he
will
prove
it
to
the
buyer
and
then
shows
him
a
movie
showing
grease
--
what
appears
to
be
grease
stains
removed
by
what
appears
to
be
the
same
product,
buyers
believe
that
they're
seeing
the
very
thing
done.
they
believe
they
are
receiving
something
to
--
on
which
they
can
rely.
that's
what
proof
is,
some
independent
confirmation
of
the
truth
of
their
claims.
finally,
the
commission's
order
is
limited
to
this.
the
commission's
order
doesn't
reach
as
the
respondents
would
suggest
every
use
of
mock-ups
and
test.
it
forbids
a
representation
that
tests
furnish
actual
proof.
and
i'll
close
by
saying,
it
doesn't
forbid
anything
about
mock-ups.
mock-ups
can
be
eliminated
from
the
order.
the
commission
would
have
no
objection.
i'll
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
your
honor.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
mr.
chief
justice,
i
--
my
bewilderment
is
that
i
sit
in
that
chair
and
i
can
agree
practically
with
everything
the
respondents
say.
this
case
does
not
involve
the
commission's
objection
to
the
use
of
mock-ups.
i
can
state
that
in
the
clearest
possible
form.
we
object
to
their
representing
that
they're
giving
proof.
use
mock-ups
all
you
like,
it's
a
representation.
in
this
case
it's
a
verbal
explicit
representation,
we
proved
it
to
you.
we
object
to
their
saying,
here
you
have
something
better
than
the
ordinary
ad
of
our
competitors.
you
have
proof,
now
it's
that,
it's
not
the
mock-ups.
you
can
completely
forget
about
the
mock-ups.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
your
honor,
i'm
trying
to
get
across
that
the
order,
if
you
look
at
it
bars
misrepresentations
that
you're
furnishing
proof.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
justice
goldberg's
suggestion
by
the
way
i
take
it
takes
you
right
out
of
the
order.
that
doesn't
take
another
order
mr.
justice
stewart.
it
takes
you
right
out
of
it.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
that
it
was
a
reproduction?
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
oh
in
this
case
it
wouldn't
be
the
truth.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
why
wouldn't
it
be
--
if
it
were
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
no
i
think
--
what
they
would
be
showing
would
be
a
reproduction
of
an
actual
test.
there
was
an
actual
test
that
had
been
conducted.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
well,
what
both
sides
are
interested
in
is
the
propriety
of
forbidding
misrepresentations
of
proof
and
that
is
in
this
case
and
it
isn't
satisfied
by
the
other
half
of
the
order.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
that
is
not
so
justice
harlan,
we
are
not
trying
to
stop
these
mock-ups.
we're
trying
to
stop
the
use
of
the
words
we
are
proving
something.
if
the
court
would
--
if
we
would
get
three
quarters
of
what
we
want
in
this
case,
if
the
court
were
to
say
“don't
use
the
words
proof”
that
word
in
quotes
unless
you're
actually
getting
proof.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
what?
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
the
other
court
would
say
don't
imply
the
word
proof.
the
first
case
in
which
the
commission
presented
this
theory
was
not
a
mock-up
case.
a
seller
of
cars
represented
that
his
--
a
seller
of
wax
represented
that
his
wax
could
withstand
great
heat
and
cold
variations.
he
poured
gasoline
on
and
lit
the
gasoline
on
television
and
then
he
poured
cold
water
on
it.
he
actually
lit
gasoline,
he
actually
poured
cold
water
on
it,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
it
was
deceptive
because
pouring
gasoline
on
doesn't
--
the
gasoline
burns
inches
off
the
wax
and
it
doesn't
heat
anything.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
and
i
say
that
and
i
say
it's
very
important
to
viewers,
lots
of
people
are
going
to
buy
this
if
they
think
its
an
actual
test
and
not
buy
it
if
they
have
the
uncertainty
of
not
knowing.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
don't
--
this
has
never
been
--
with
all
deference
your
honor
i
think
the
respondents
have
a
red
herring
here.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
don't
see
how
the
issue
could
be
more
clearly
presented
in
any
case
than
this
one
unless
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
don't
understand
how
the
falsity
of
the
claim
about
the
product
can
in
anyway
detract
from
the
falsity
of
the
claim
that
they
were
furnishing
visual
proof.
i'd
like
to
say
just
as
justice
white
asked,
would
you
say
--
could
you
say
this
is
a
mock-up
or
this
is
not
a
mock-up.
this
is
it.
judge
bailey
aldrich
suggested
you
couldn't.
our
case
is
a
representation.
this
is
not
a
mock-up.
they
said
you're
seeing
visual
proof.
you're
being
asked
to
draw
a
line
between
a
representation
that
you're
seeing
visual
proof
and
a
representation
that
what
you're
seeing
does
not
involve
the
use
of
a
mock-up.
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
what
is
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
don't
have
any
--
mr.
philip
b.
heymann
i
think
it's
a
good
--
i'd
like
to
respond
to
that
justice
white.
in
95%
of
the
ads
or
97%,
i
don't
think
that
anyone
could
say
that
there
was
what
the
commission
orders
--
refers
to
an
experiment
or
test
represented
as
actual
proof.
nothing
is
required,
if
you
put
on
a
test,
you
have
--
if
you
put
on
a
test,
in
many
cases
