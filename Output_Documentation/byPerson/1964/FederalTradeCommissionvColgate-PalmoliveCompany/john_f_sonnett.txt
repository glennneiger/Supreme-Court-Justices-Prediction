mr.
john
f.
sonnett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honors
will
find
at
page
39
of
the
record,
the
statement
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
first
opinion
about
eight
lines,
ten
lines
up
from
the
bottom
where
the
court
of
appeals
said,
in
other
words
referring
to
the
commission's
theory,
in
other
words,
it
would
be
no
defense
that
as
the
examiner
found
on
undisputed
testimony
here,
the
shaving
of
sandpaper
even
when
in
fact
accomplished,
does
not
properly
reproduce
on
television
and
must
be
simulated
to
be
affective.
that
i
think
your
honors
is
the
only
thing
in
the
record
before
you
specifically
on
the
point.
but
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
mr.
chief
justice,
that
would
not
only
destroy
the
value
of
the
commercial,
but
i
think
it
would
drive
madison
avenue
and
the
broadcasting
business
and
the
viewers
wild.
i
can't
imagine
anybody
looking
at
a
commercial
for
80
minutes.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
i
don't
think
it
takes
80
minutes
either,
but
i'm
suggesting
mr.
chief
justice
that
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
you
correctly
restated
it,
your
honor.
my
difficulty
is
what
his
statement,
of
what
the
record
shows.
there
was
during
the
hearing
before
the
examiner,
attention
given
primarily
to
the
question
of
how
long
you
had
to
soak
the
sandpaper
before
you
could
shave
it,
and
there
was
expert
evidence
and
the
parties
concentrated
on
the
question
whether
the
representation
was
true
or
not.
that
was
the
focus
and
the
focal
point
of
the
hearing
before
the
examiner.
the
colgate
counsel
at
that
time
put
great
effort
into
proving
and
we
think,
made
a
reasonably
good
record
that
the
word
soak
used
in
the
commercial,
which
your
honor
will
find
at
pages
8
and
10
--
through
10
i
believe
of
the
record.
at
page
10,
there
is
a
description
of
this
commercial.
now
in
this
commercial,
the
announcer
said
with
respect
to
the
sandpaper
test,
it
was
apply
soak
and
often
a
stroke.
it
was
held
below
that,
that
was
a
misrepresentation,
because
the
soaking
could
not
be
done
as
quickly
as
the
ad
implied.
and
we
do
not
here
challenge
that
aspect
of
the
finding,
because
that
is
not
the
question
before
your
honors.
it
is
quite
a
different
question,
that
phase
of
this
case
is
behind
us
so
far
as
decision
is
concerned.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
we
do
not
here
contend
before
your
honors
today,
that
there
was
no
misrepresentation
in
that
respect.
however,
that
has
nothing
really
to
do
we
submit
with
the
question
your
honors
have
called
out
to
decide
which
was
injected
into
this
case
late
in
the
game
and
on
the
basis
of
a
wholly
inadequate
record.
what
i
am
suggesting
to
your
honor
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
before
you
with
respect
to
the
use
of
mock-ups
in
television,
their
need,
their
justification,
the
public
awareness
of
them
or
anything
of
that
kind.
what
we
had
here
was
the
commission
coming
up
with
a
pet
theory
of
law,
which
it
dragged
into
this
case
by
the
heels
on
the
basis
that
the
record
limited
only
to
this
sandpaper
commercial
ad,
and
what
the
commission
has
done
by
its
order,
contrary
to
what
the
government
suggests,
is
to
say
and
this
is
the
proposition
before
this
court.
when
it
is
necessary
in
a
television
or
other
commercial
or
advertisement
to
use
a
substitute
in
order
to
convey
the
truth,
you
may
not
use
the
substitute,
in
order
to
convey
the
truth
unless
you
tell
the
viewer
that
you
are
using
a
substitute.
that
is
the
heart
of
the
problem.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
i
say
there
is
no
representation,
mr.
justice
white
based
on
what
this
commercial
was.
and
secondly,
i
say
there
is
no
representation
that
it
was
actually
sandpaper
with
respect
to
a
material
claim
being
made
for
the
product,
namely
the
moisturizing
qualities.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
that
it
was
necessarily
real
sandpaper
or
that
if
it
was,
the
representation
was
material.
the
basic
representation
made
was
a
representation
with
respect
to
the
product.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
i
say
that
the
representation
that
is
material
is
whether,
if
the
viewer
were
in
the
studio
and
if
the
test
were
performed
before
his
eyes,
and
if
real
sandpaper
were
used
and
if
it
could
be
shaved
exactly
as
the
commercial
depicted
it
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
–
that,
that
would
all
be
true,
but
when
they
want
to
put
a
television
camera
on
the
same
thing
in
order
to
convey
that
truth
to
the
viewer,
they
must
use
a
substitute.
hence,
there
is
no
material
misrepresentation.
this
is
peculiarly
enough
a
case
in
which
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
either
way
or
both.
however,
your
honors
should
decide
it
to
be.
i
say
that
--
i
prefer
to
think
of
it
as
neither
a
representation
or
if
it
is
one,
a
material
one.
but
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
with
respect
your
honor
to
--
there
is
a
problem
with
respect
to
paragraph
3
relating
to
bates
which
is
covered
by
the
briefs.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
and
i
don't
propose
to
get
into
that
question.
with
respect
to
paragraph
2
relating
to
colgate,
there
is
a
problem
with
respect
to
the
language
of
that
order,
and
that
language
has
not
been
approved
by
the
court
below.
the
court
below,
your
honor
will
find
in
its
opinions
specifically
refused
to
approve
the
provisions,
any
of
the
provisions
of
the
order
and
said
to
the
commission,
you'd
better
draft
a
brand
new
order
confined
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
before
you,
at
this
time,
it
is
only
paragraph
1.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
of
the
order,
section
1,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
all
of
one,
your
honor
is
before
you
on
the
main
point
of
the
appeal.
there
are
questions
with
respect
to
three
which
are
briefed,
but
in
terms
of
the
principle
problem
before
you,
it
is
paragraph
1
of
the
order.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
you
do
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
i
think
that
we
must
recognize
that
this
proceeding
has
had
a
rather
peculiar
history.
it
went
through
the
commission,
once
it
went
up
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
there
was
a
decision
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
flatly
rejected
the
theory
of
law
that
the
commission
was
proceeding
on.
it
went
back
to
the
commission
which
did
not
comply
with
the
mandate
and
did
not
petition
for
certiorari.
the
commission
took
another
crack
at
expressing
its
theory
of
the
law
because
it
felt
that
it
wasn't
clear
enough
the
first
time.
it
restated
its
argument,
it
went
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
again.
the
court
of
appeals
in
another
patient
and
detailed
review
again
disagreed
with
the
commission
and
it
got
back
and
is
now
here.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
mr.
justice
goldberg,
that
question
is
not
before
you
and
i
would
not
so
maintain
in
any
event.
that's
another
phase
of
this
case
not
here
involved,
but
i
think
that
the
problem
with
the
case
is
that
the
government,
having
made
four
or
five
stabs
at
it
hasn't
yet
really
defined
the
question.
and
the
question
which
your
honors
have
been
seeking
to
have
defined
today
is
i
believe
and
it's
the
only
question
really
before
you,
where
the
use
of
a
substitute
is
necessary
or
perhaps
even
appropriate
in
order
to
communicate
the
truth
in
an
advertising
message
on
the
television,
is
the
use
of
the
substitute
alone,
without
disposing
it
an
unfair
trade
practice.
that's
i
think
is
the
question
and
the
only
question
presented.
your
honors
will
find
that
the
commission
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
mr.
chief
justice,
you've
given
me
the
opportunity
to
comment
on
something
in
that
regard,
which
without
meaning
to
twit
the
government
but
i
think
there
maybe
at
least
a
violation
of
the
spirit
if
not
the
letter
of
rule
40
(d)
--
41
(d)
(1)
of
the
rules
of
practice
of
this
court.
your
honors
will
recall
that,
that
rule
is
designed
to
prevent
the
presentation
to
this
court
in
argument
of
questions
which
differ
in
substance
from
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
now
whether
or
not
there's
a
violation
by
the
government
of
rule
40,
i
don't
press,
but
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention,
the
very
curious
and
very
revealing,
because
it's
revealing
the
lack
of
clarity
with
which
the
government
has
approached
this
problem.
if
your
honor
will
look
at
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
at
page
2,
it
reads
as
follows,
whether
the
federal
trade
commission
may
prohibit
as
an
unfair
or
deceptive
trade
practice,
the
representation
that
a
test,
experiment
or
similar
demonstration
shown
on
television
provides
the
viewer
with
visual
proof
of
a
product
claim
(which
may
itself
be
true)
when
the
test
is
a
sham
which
proves
nothing
because
of
the
undisclosed
use
of
a
mock-up
in
the
test.
now,
when
the
government
comes
to
present
this
question
in
its
brief,
the
furious
and
revealing
omission
is
that
they
takeout
the
matter
in
the
parenthesis
which
was
in
the
question
stated
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
the
heart
of
the
problem
is
that
the
claim
made
is
true
by
definition
before
your
honors
today.
it's
true
in
every
case.
that
is
the
question
really
being
presented
to
you.
curiously
enough,
the
government
sought
to
duck
the
question
in
its
brief
and
they're
still
ducking
it.
the
only
rational
basis
we
submit
upon
which
the
federal
trade
commission
or
the
courts
should
view
advertisements
is
whether
the
message
communicates
the
truth.
neither
the
commission
nor
the
court
should
be
concerned
with
the
problem
of
how
the
truth
is
communicated,
so
long
as
by
definition,
the
truth
is
communicated
and
so
understood
by
the
viewer.
here
by
definition
the
viewer
on
the
television
screen
would
see
the
representation
of
a
sandpaper
test
identical
with
what
he
would
see
if
he
went
to
the
studio
and
they
used
real
sandpaper
and
everything
by
hypothesis.
and
the
question
before
you
is
assumed
to
be
absolutely
true
and
correct,
the
product
claim,
everything
is
correct
except
for
one
thing.
we
have
to
use
plastic
with
sand
on
it
rather
than
sandpaper
because
as
the
finding
shows,
sandpaper
won't
be
photographed.
now
if
the
commission
is
going
to
get
into
the
business
of
regulating
advertising
by
telling
advertisers
how
to
tell
the
truth
rather
than
stopping
them
from
lying,
we're
going
to
have
the
commission
getting
into
a
business
where
the
hand
of
the
government
can
create
great
havoc.
the
need
for
mock-ups
in
this
industry
which
is
a
vital
and
growing
industry,
the
nature
of
the
changes
in
the
technology
of
broadcasting,
the
justification
whether
it
be
technical
or
economic
for
this
or
that
device
in
broadcasting,
the
matter
is
better
left
i
think
to
the
industry
rather
than
by
government
regulation.
in
any
event,
where
what
is
done
tells
only
the
truth
and
the
viewer
can
understand
only
the
truth
from
what
is
told,
i
submit
there
can
be
no
deception
within
the
act.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
there
was,
mr.
chief
justice,
a
pause
and
this
was
a
matter
of
some
controversy
below
--
before
the
examiner.
the
word
soak,
it
was
apply
soak
and
then
off
in
a
stroke.
now,
we
don't
dispute
the
present
purposes
that
it
couldn't
be
shaved
as
quickly
as
the
ad
made
it
appear,
but
that
problem
is
not
before
us.
by
definition
here,
and
i
think
perhaps
the
commissions'
own
words
on
this
maybe
helpful
mr.
chief
justice,
by
definition
here,
every
word
that
we
said
in
that
commercial
was
true,
that's
the
hypothesis
of
the
problem
before
you.
every
word
is
true.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes
your
honor
if
i
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
i
don't
think
you
do.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
that
is
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
mr.
chief
justice,
we
do
not
here
dispute
that.
we
do
not
here
dispute
that.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
it
would
be
sir,
yes,
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
not
our
problem
here.
our
problem
here
is,
if
i
may
invite
the
court's
attention
to
a
very
interesting
footnote
in
--
when
this
commission
took
its
--
made
its
second
effort
to
express
its
theory
with
respect
to
mock-ups,
because
we're
not
concerned
with
the
first
portion
of
the
case
your
honor.
on
page
60
of
the
record,
footnote
12,
the
last
footnote
to
the
second
opinion
of
the
commission.
your
honors
will
see
that
the
commission
was
still
apprehensive
as
to
whether
they'd
thought
through
or
explained
that
position
adequately
and
then
in
the
second
paragraph
of
that
footnote,
the
commission
said
“thus
even
if
it
be
assumed
in
the
instant
case
that
rapid
shave
can
in
fact
shave
sandpaper
precisely
as
shown
in
the
commercials
and
that
a
mock-up
was
used
only
because
real
sandpaper
cannot
faithfully
by
reproduced
on
television,
it
misses
the
point
to
say
that
the
commercials
were
therefore
free
from
falsehood.”
respondents
they
say
did
more
than
mere
use
a
mock-up.
they
made
an
affirmative
representation
that
it
was
falls
namely
that
they
were
presenting
an
actual
test
and
giving
actual
proof
of
rapid
shave's
ability
to
shave
real
sandpaper,
and
then
in
the
test,
real
sandpaper
was
being
used.
they
go
on
to
say
that
the
misrepresentation
would
not
have
been
any
worse
if
there
had
been
an
explicit
statement
that
it
was
real
sandpaper
was
being
used.
now,
the
question
therefore
before
your
honors
really
i
believe
on
analysis
comes
down
to
the
simple
proposition
whether
it
can
ever
be
an
unfair
trade
practice
to
use
a
substitute
in
an
advertisement
where
the
use
of
the
substitute
is
necessary
in
order
to
convey
the
truth
in
the
advertising
message
and
i
think
that's
the
heart
of
the
question.
i
submit
the
answer
to
that
can
only
be
that
the
court
below
was
right
on
this
point
because
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
so
maintain,
but
i
don't
think
the
court
has
to
go
that
far.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
yes,
yes.
i
would
say
and
it
our
position
that
wherever
you
must
use
a
substitute
to
tell
the
truth
even
if
you
don't
disclose
the
use
of
the
substitute,
you
are
still
nevertheless
telling
the
truth
and
therefore
there
can
be
no
misrepresentation.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
ah,
now
that's
a
different
question
and
one
not
before
us.
i
think
that
the
specific
reference
to
the
question
might
render
material
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
never
on
the
state
of
facts
mr.
justice
white.
if
you
add
to
it
an
explicit
statement
that
no
substitute
is
being
used,
i
think
that
explicit
statement
tends
to
make
more
material,
more
material
perhaps
that
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
i'm
not
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
logically,
i
don't
think
i
need
say
that
it
would,
but
i
don't
think
we
need
immediate
here.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
i
don't
think
so
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
i
don't
think
that
the
representation,
in
any
event
i'm
sure
in
my
own
mind
that
if
there
is
a
representation,
it's
not
material.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
i
don't
have
to
but
i
will
sir.
i
think
that
we
are
--
i
don't
think
we
need
to
reach
that
to
decide
this.
but
i
am
prepared
to
say
that,
that
is
also
our
position.
but
we
needn't
reach
that
point,
that's
not
in
our
case.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
mr.
justice
white,
one
of
the
great
deficiencies
of
this
record
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
establish
anything
with
respect
to
the
public's
awareness
these
days
of
the
use
of
mock-ups
and
other
artifices
or
substitutes
on
television.
this
record
is
wholly
deficient
with
respect
to
anything
relating
to
mock-ups
and
what
the
people
understand.
i
suppose
most
people
know
that
people
wear
blue
shirts
in
order
that
they
photograph
white,
that's
pretty
well-known.
but,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
that
warrants
a
general
rule
making
or
prohibiting
as
this
does,
the
use
of
mock-ups
where
you
need
to
use
them
to
tell
the
truth,
the
commission
says
you
can
only
do
that
if
you
disclose
that
you
are
doing
it.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well
mr.
justice
black,
it
would
render
the
commercials
as
the
court
below
found,
impractical
and
unworkable
because
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
the
amount
of
disclosure
you
would
have
to
make
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
in
this
case
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
wouldn't
we
have
to
go
further
mr.
justice
black
and
say,
this
is
not
real
sandpaper
because,
although
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
because
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
because
by
hypothesis
as
the
question
comes
to
you,
we
can
actually
shave
real
sandpaper
just
as
the
commercial
describes
it.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
because
the
truth
by
hypothesis
mr.
justice
black
as
the
question
comes
to
you
is
that
this
product
can
do
exactly
that,
that's
the
hypothesis.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
because
there
is
no
deceit
involved.
if
i
may
restate
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
mr.
justice
black,
may
i
put
it
you
this
way.
if
you
were
to
go
to
the
nbc
studio
in
washington
and
see
this
test
performed
with
real
sandpaper
and
if
by
hypothesis,
every
word
in
that
commercial
using
real
sandpaper
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
were
true
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
there
is
no
way
that
we
could
communicate
to
the
public
the
fact
that
this
test
had
been
or
could
been
--
could
be
performed
which
is,
i
think
a
fair
reading
also
of
the
commercial.
there
is
no
way
to
do
it
by
hypothesis
in
that
basis.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well
not
within
the
time
stated,
but--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
no
mr.
justice
black,
with
great
respect
that
is
not
the
question.
your
question
assumes
that
we
are
here
still
trying
to
defend
the
ad
as
it
actually
went
out
and
let
me
say
that
isn't
the
problem
before
you.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
to
tell
the
truth
by
use
of
a
substitute
cannot
possibly
be
deception,
i
submit.
how
can
it
be?
how
can
it
be?
by
hypothesis,
we
are
communicating
to
the
viewer
what
the
viewer
sees
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
but
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
no,
no,
but
we're
assuming
in
the
hypothetical
question
you
are
called
on
to
decide
that
it
can
be
done
your
honor,
that
is
whole
point.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
if
it
could,
and
that's
the
question
before
you.
if
it
could,
the
problem
is
whether
and
i
dislike
confining
it
to
this
particular
case
because
it
does
inject
into
the
hypothetical
question
before
you
shades
of
the
other
question
we're
not
here
dealing
with.
i
think
the
rope
machine
case
maybe
a
better
answer.
if
you
look
at
the
bates
brief
at
page
10,
the
point
of
that
illustration
is
that
you
have
a
machine
in
a
building
some
place
surrounded
with
pipes
and
girdles
and
bricks
and
mortar
and
it's
designed
to
test
nylon
rope
and
it
can
test
it
but
you
can't
get
the
television
cameras
in
there
to
photograph
the
actual
test
being
made.
so
you
make
a
prop,
a
paper
mache
and
you
put
it
up
in
the
studio
to
look
like
the
real
machine,
you
use
not
nylon
rope
which
the
advertiser
is
selling
but
you
use
a
cotton
rope
so
it
won't
break
the
paper
mache
machine.
you
use
an
actor
and
not
an
engineer
and
the
message
is
“our
machine,
our
test
before
your
very
eyes.
we'll
show
you
that
our
nylon
rope
will
withstand
the
pressure
of
6,000
pounds.”
now
every
word
of
that
is
true,
every
word
of
that
is
true.
where
is
the
public
deception?
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
the
difficulty
with
it
is
that
the
announcement
i'm
afraid
can't
be
short
and
the
message
be
of
any
utility.
and
before
example,
to
revert
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
and
to
get
back
again
to
the
rather
unfortunate
problem
of
this
sandpaper
case
which
is
wholly
illustrative
–
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
that
is
not
what
the
commission
has
done
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
i
would
completely
agree
mr.
justice
black
that
they
can
and
should
if
that
were
our
case,
but
it
is
not
our
case.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
no
sir,
that
is
not
our
case,
because
number
one
goes
far
beyond
any
necessity
to
eliminate
misrepresentation
with
respect
to
any
material
claim
concerning
the
product.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
i
think
that
is
again
part
of
the
problem
that
the
commission
should
have
explored
if
it
were
going
to
try
to
legislate
generally
about
the
use
of
mock-ups.
your
honor
has
raised
the
question
of
pre-recordings.
when
you
put
on
a
program
which
happens
to
be
pre-recorded
and
don't
announce
that
its
pre-recording
that
you're
showing,
are
you
misleading
the
viewer?
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
the
public
so
understands
it.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well
as
part
[attempt
to
laughter]
of
the
logical
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
logical
result
of
what
the
commission
has
said
here,
we'll
be
confronted
with
that
i'm
afraid.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
oh!
this
was
pre-recorded
but
that
isn't
as
such
has
not
been
the
focal
point
of
the
problem.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
that
in
substance
is
our
position
mr.
justice
brennan,
yes.
it
lets
out
that
we
had
to
use
a
substitute,
which
you
have
to
--
where
to
tell
the
truth
about
the
message,
for
the
advertising
you
must
use
a
substitute
in
a
pictorial
representation,
you
should
be
free
to
do
it.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
yes.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
you
have
our
situation
exactly
mr.
justice
white.
i
find
it
impossible
to
believe
that
if
a
viewer
in
the
studio,
sitting
there
would
see
the
actual
test
with
the
actual
sandpaper
and
every
word
said
to
him
was
literally
true,
which
is
the
hypothesis
here
and
then
you
put
a
television
camera
on
it
but
you
have
to
take
the
sandpaper
away
because
you
need
a
piece
of
plastic
that
looked
like
sandpaper
with
sand
on
it,
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
that
suddenly
becomes
a
deceptive
trade
practice.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
because
i
think
that
the
people
in
the
broadcasting
business,
the
people
in
the
advertising
business
tend
to
agree
with
the
feeling
of
the
court
below
that
the
apologia
with
respect
to
it,
might
take
so
much
time
in
a
30-second
commercial
that
the
commercial
would
be
non-productive
and
it
cannot
use
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
that
mr.
justice
goldberg
is
something,
perhaps
the
commission
should
have
explored
on
a
record,
but
didn't.
there's
nothing
in
this
record
that
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
oh!
yes
indeed
sir.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
there's
no
way
of
knowing
what
they
really
mean
by
disclosure.
there's
no
way
of
knowing
how
much
public
awareness
of
television
or
broadcasting
these
days
requires
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
exactly
mr.
justice
douglas.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
you
are
not
wrong
sir.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
i
could
not
agree
more
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
not
80
your
honor
but
longer
than
what
we're
shown
on
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
oh!
we're
not
disputing
that
your
honor,
we're
not
disputing
that.
what
we're
saying
is
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
when
they
say
to
us
that
we
cannot
use
a
substitute
in
order
to
convey
the
truth,
where
by
definition
everything
we
are
communicating
is
true
and
they
say
you
can't
use
a
substitute
without
disclosing
it,
we
think
they're
going
to
be
on
their
powers.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
i
hope
not
your
honor.[laughter]
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well
we
did
not
think
--
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
well,
the
order
of
course
goes
far
beyond
just
the
television,
the
sandpaper
advertising
thing.
it
really
reaches
and
it
does,
although
the
case
--
the
court
below
described
this
case
as
trivial.
mr.
john
f.
sonnett
i'm
delighted
to
be
here,
but
still
we
came
[laughter]
because
we
were
respondents,
but
the
point
is
that
the
order
in
paragraph
1
has
an
impact
undoubtedly
in
the
advertising
and
broadcasting
business
that
goes
far
beyond
this
particular
commercial.
it
has
a
very
adverse
impact
on
broadcasting
and
advertising.
