ms.
elizabeth
palmer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
certiorari
was
granted
in
this
case
to
review
a
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
which
held
that
since
mental
hospitals
serve
a
proper
public
function
that
it
is
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
clause
for
a
state
to
require
a
patient's
close
family
members
to
reimburse
in
any
part
for
the
cause
of
the
patient's
care
at
the
state
hospital.
the
california
statute
imposed
a
joint
and
several
liability
upon
the
patient's
estate,
the
spouse,
parents,
and
children.
pursuant
to
this
statute,
the
department
of
mental
hygiene
filed
a
claim
in
the
estate
of
a
deceased
daughter
for
the
care
of
her
mother
at
agnews
state
hospital.
the
respondent
--
the
administratrix
of
the
estate
rejected
this
claim
and
this
action
was
brought.
the
respondent's
contention
throughout
the
proceeding
was
that
the
mother's
estate
must
be
completely
exhausted
before
any
liability
would
pass
to
the
patient's
estate.
both
parties
moot
for
judgment
on
the
pleadings
and
judgment
was
granted
to
the
department
of
mental
hygiene.
now
--
although,
it
is
irrelevant
under
a
joint
and
several
obligations,
and
solely
to
refute
the
implication
that
the
department
of
mental
hygiene
did
act
in
an
arbitrary
fashion
and
proceeding
against
the
estate
of
the
deceased
daughter.
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
the
mother's
estate
although
of
some
$11,000
was
not
available
for
her
support.
it
was
subject
to
a
lien
by
the
department
of
mental
hygiene
as
we
have
set
forth
quite
clearly
in
our
brief.
now,
we'd
like
to
point
out
that
amicus
curiae,
the
american
federation
for
the
blind,
who
has
failed
the
brief
and
behalf
of
respondents
agrees
with
our
contention
that
this
was
an
impoverished
person.
the
district
court
of
appeal
confirmed
the
decision
of
the
superior
court,
the
supreme
court
of
california
reversed
with
its
precedent
shattering
decision.
so
the
issue
framed
--
the
issue
before
this
court
was
sold
frames
--
was
framed
completely
by
the
court
below
and
not
by
the
parties
as
to
whether
it
is
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
clause
for
a
state
to
require
reimbursement
from
financially
closed
--
from
close
relatives
who
are
financially
able
to
do
so.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
no,
your
honor.
it
was
not
raised
you
see
by
any
other
parties.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
that's
right.
it
has.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
no.
i
would
say
that
--
and
it
is
our
contention
that
it's
solely
on
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
justice
sharr
(ph)
in
his
opinion
says,
“it
is
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
clause
in
two
places
makes
no
reference
to
the
california
privileges
and
immunities
or
the
general
uniform
operation
of
the
law.”
furthermore,
the
california
--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
no,
we
do
not
sir.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
no,
we
do
not
sir.
we
have
a
--
all
law
shall
be
of
jun
--
general
uniform
operation
and
then
the
usual
privileges
or
immunities
that
equal
protection
is
not
mentioned
at
all
in
the
california
constitution.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
it
has
in
some
cases
your
honor,
but
when
the
california
court
has
chosen
to
rest
it
on
the
california
constitution,
it
has
said
so
with
precision.
as
in
the
mcgilvery
case
they
said,
“this
is
not
--
does
not
violate
either
the
provisions
of
article
i,
section
10
and
the
other
section
of
the
california
constitution
nor
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution”.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
they
--
but
they
said
equal
protection
clause.
they
furthermore
found
the
case
that
disposed
to
the
whole
issue,
department
of
mental
hygiene
against
hawley
which
specifically
says,
“fourteenth
amendment.”
so
if
you
read
what
they
said
precisely
in
kirchner
plus
what
they
said
in
hawley
which
was
dispositive,
it's
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
yes,
sir,
they
have.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
they
could
have
sir.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
but
they
did
not.
and
as
--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
your
honor,
on
petition
for
rehearing,
we
pointed
out
basic
--
and
concluded
and
made
the
conclusion
that
it
was
on
the
federal
constitution.
that
court
had
the
opportunity
to
deny
our
presumption
and
they
did
not
do
so.
they
denied
our
re
--
petition
for
rehearing
without
comment.
so
i
believe
that
because
we
did
afford
them
that
opportunity
and
they
refused
to
take
it
that
we
can
assume
that
they
have
it
ruled.
now,
in
some
old
cases
in
california,
(inaudible)
which
is
in
volume
134
of
the
california
reports
and
state
commission
in
lunacy
against
eldridge
which
is
in
volume
7
of
the
california
appellate
reports
which
cites
from
the
(inaudible)
case
saying
that
on
this
very
point
of
whether
payment
maybe
obtained
from
a
patient's
relatives,
(inaudible)
was
the
patient
but
eldridge
was
the
father.
the
court
said,
“our
constitution
does
--
had
--
does
not
prevent
the
repayment
nor
do
we
find
in
any
state
constitution
a
prevention
for
this.”
and
it
was
clear
that
those
decisions
were
rested
on
the
california
constitution
and
did
not
relate
to
the
federal
constitution.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
i
don't
know
whether
they
would
or
not.
i
would
--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
--
have
this
in
mind.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
that
it
would
make
42
other
states
happy
your
honor
if
you
would
determine
on
the
united
states'
constitution.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
i
think
very
clearly
it
would
because
they
have
--
in
a
measure
equated.
now,
i
could
not
nor
i
have
found
any
case
which
says
that
they
must
in
all
cases
be
ruled
precisely
the
same.
but
i
know
that
the
california
court
has
the
utmost
respect
for
this
body
and
that
they
would
be
influenced
to
a
great
degree
by
your
decision.
the
california
statute
itself
does
not
permit
an
arbitrary
exercise
of
power.
the
court
below
did
hold
and
did
state
that
under
this
statute
there
was
an
opportunity
for
the
administrative
agency
to
the
--
denude
the
assets
of
the
relative
and
this
we
wish
to
emphatically
refute
because
the
court
disregarded
companion
statutes
in
the
very
same
article
of
the
very
same
chapter
on
the
--
on
this
obligation
and
companion
statutes
also.
now,
in
the
very
same
article
of
the
same
chapter,
there
is
a
section
that
requires
the
department
of
mental
hygiene
to
investigate
and
ascertain
if
in
fact
the
relatives
are
financially
able
to
make
this
payment.
there
is
a
section
also
that
grants
to
the
director
of
the
department
of
mental
hygiene
a
discretion
to
reduce
counsel
or
remit
the
charges
upon
satisfactory
proof
of
inability
to
pay.
with
these
safeguards
plus
the
fact
that
no
administrator
can
action
an
arbitrary
fashion
in
california
without
his
decisions
being
subject
to
review
by
the
courts.
so
therefore,
the
possibility
is
extremely
remote
that
any
relative
could
be
denuded
of
his,
her
--
or
her
assets
and
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
in
this
record
that
the
estate
of
the
deceased
daughter
has
any
danger
of
being
stripped.
this
was
never
the
contention
of
the
respondents.
the
whole
allegation
was
the
mother
has
property.
you
got
to
take
it
all
of
it
before
this
estate
becomes
liable.
there
is
--
it's
also
in
the
civil
code
of
california,
the
provision
that
under
every
joint
and
several
obligations,
there
is
the
right
to
contribution.
there
are
also
the
cases
that
state
that
under
the
right
to
contribution,
this
is
an
equitable
proceeding
so
that
the
very
facts
the
department
of
mental
hygiene
has
to
consider,
the
natural
ability
would
also
be
considered
by
the
court
under
contribution.
so
it
is
simply
not
true
that
irks
in
financial
burdens
can
be
imposed
upon
the
relatives
of
the
mental
patient.
and
there
i
think
also
that
this
court
should
be
interested
in
knowing
that
poverty
has
not
one
thing
to
do
with
the
admission
to
our
state
hospitals
nor
does
wealth
that
whether
you
are
rich
or
poor,
whether
you
can
pay
or
do
pay
in
whole
or
in
part
for
the
care
--
your
--
the
medical
attention,
the
facilities,
the
whole
program
is
precisely
the
same.
so
truly,
poverty
is
a
neutral
fact
in
california
for
admission
and
for
care
and
treatment,
just
as
race,
creed,
or
color
is.
there
is
no
economic
segregation
or
discrimination
in
our
california
hospitals.
it
has
been
--
the
california
court
implied
that
the
primary
function
of
our
state
mental
hospitals
is
protection
of
the
public.
the
respondent
has
asserted
that
only
the
dangerously,
mentally
--
or
dangerously
insane
are
committed
to
hospitals
such
as
agnew
state
hospital.
now,
this
once
was
the
law
and
it
is
not
the
law
now.
the
statute
--
section
5100
of
the
welfare
and
institutions
code,
provides
that
the
court
must
find
that
the
person
needs
care,
treatment,
supervision
or
restraint
in
the
alternative
and
then
the
most
important
alternative
or
maybe
dangerous
to
himself
or
to
others.
no
longer
must
the
court
find
in
addition
to
the
need
for
care,
treatment,
supervisions
and
will
be
dangerous
to
himself
or
others.
that's
no
longer
true
that
anyone
of
those
will
satisfy
the
statutory
requirement
for
admission
or
commitment
to
the
state
hospital.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
the
contribution
for
county
hospitals
mr.
chief
justice
is
contribution,
yes.
but
it
is
set
up
in
a
series
fashion
that
in
the
order
named
the
patient's
estate,
spouse,
parents,
and
children
and
it
goes
in
that
order.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
oh,
yes.
i
--
i
am
sorry,
i
didn't
understand
you.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
for
the
county
hospitals,
there
is
the
rule
that
you
can't
--
that
if
you
can
pay
in
whole
for
your
support,
you
cannot
be
admitted
to
a
county
hospital.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
(inaudible)
v.
bright
and
i
don't
have
the
citation.
i'm
sorry,
it
still
helps.
but
if
it
--
in
any
measure
you
cannot
pay
for
your
entire
cost
or
your
relatives
cannot
pay
for
your
entire
cost
then
you
may
be
admitted
to
the
county
hospital.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
this
has
been
raised
in
the
los
angeles
court,
i
believe,
when
the
county
counsel
of
los
angeles
county
sought
the
contribution
for
state
--
for
county
hospital
care
and
the
kirchner
decision
was
cited
as
being
controlling.
now,
i
believe
that
that
case
as
well
as
the
great
many
others
in
california
are
being
held
in
advance
pending
this
court's
decision.
but
it
must
also
be
brought
to
mind
that
a
large
number,
an
ever
increasing
number
of
patients
are
being
voluntarily
admitted
to
our
state
hospitals
for
care
and
treatment.
the
statute
says,
“if
a
person
feels
that
they
need
care
and
treatment
they
may
apply
for
admission
to
the
state
hospital.”
and
the
psychiatrist
in
the
hospitals
are
greatly
pleased
to
know
that
we
are
getting
away
from
the
stigma
of
commitment
to
proceedings
that
people
are
more,
more
and
more
seeking
treatment
for
mental
disorders
as
they
would
for
say,
appendicitis
or
some
other
illness.
now,
certainly
you
cannot
say
that
these
people
who
recognize
their
own
problem
are
dangerously
insane.
that
simply
is
not
true
nor
--
may
it
please
the
court.
we
do
not
maintain
that
the
california
legislature
might
not
be
able
to
workout
a
better
statutory
scheme
in
this
matter.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
know
a
great
many
states
including
california
are
trying
to
workout
statutory
--
schemes
for
reimbursement
that
maybe
fair
but
we
do
maintain
that
it
is
a
fair
statute.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
that
this
is
--
this
is
truly
a
matter
of
social
philosophy
which
should
remain
with
the
legislature
to
deal
with
and
not
with
the
courts.
that
--
that's
precisely
what
we
contend
your
honor.
as
i
pointed
out
previously,
there
are
42
other
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
that
have
statutes
that
are
similar
to
ours
and
have
been
faced
with
this
kirchner
decision
in
their
own
courts.
many
courts
of
these
jurisdictions
have
considered
the
precise
problem
that
was
before
the
california
court
or
as
they
evolved
the
question
themselves
and
no
court
including
the
prior
california
decisions
that
i
cited
to
the
court
have
held
the
statutes
in
any
way
are
relative
responsibility
to
contravene
either
state
or
federal
constitution
for
the
civilly
committed.
that
is
those
who
are
not
charged
whether
they've
been
convicted
of
a
crime.
these
courts
have
held
that
relative
responsibility
is
--
it
is
a
natural
class
upon
which
this
burden
could
be
placed
that
the
objective
to
reimburse
in
part
the
cost
of
the
state's
mental
program
is
a
proper
objective
to
be
obtained
to
relieve
the
taxpayers.
most
taxpayers
believe
that
the
legislature
doesn't
care
enough
about
encouraging
savings
to
them.
the
courts
have
also
repudiated
the
proposition
that
relative
contribution
is
a
species
of
double
taxation.
they
hold
that
what
you
contribute
in
the
way
of
taxes
does
indeed
go
for
the
general
public
benefit.
but
for
the
relatives
themselves
they
gain
and
derive
a
greater
benefit
for
which
they
are
paying
and
that
is
the
recovery
and
the
care
and
treatment
of
their
close
family
member.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
well,
your
honor
it
has
increased
over
the
last
few
years
considerably.
its
now
--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
and
then
it
went
to
$40
and
then
it
went
$90
and
then
it
went
to
$120,
and
to
make
a
long
story
short,
its
now
$309.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
$309
and
that's
where
the
mentally
ill
not
the
mentality
retarded.
in
california,
the
mentality
retarded
are
in
separate
facilities.
the
charge
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
paid
by
the
county
where
they're
mentality
retarded.
and
the
county
in
turn
seeks
reimbursement
from
the
parents
and
that
charge
is
$20
a
month.
but
if
the
patient
has
an
estate,
the
mentality
retarded
patient,
then
it
is
the
maximum
and
that
exceeds
$309
your
honor.
but
i
don't
have
the
precise
figure.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
for
the
mentally
retarded
not
the
mentality
ill.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
i
merely
made
that
observation
because
of
the
one
at
the
amicus
curiea
briefs
on
that
point.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
yes,
with
the
mentally
ill.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
that's
right
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
well,
your
honor,
it
used
to
be
but
it
no
longer
is.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
that
they
are
going
out
to
--
the
average
day
now
for
new
admittees
is
70
days.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
there
are
your
honor
and
the
--
it's
on
the
financial
ability
of
the
relatives.
there
are
many
considerations
that
are
going
into
including
--
i
have
here
and
i
can
make
available
to
the
court,
the
regular
--
the
rules
of
the
department
for
assessing
this
costs.
they
do
make
--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
alright.
thank
you
your
honor.
but
there
is
each
year
a
reevaluation
on
the
cost
of
living,
how
much
is
--
the
family,
how
many
members?
what
their
obligations
are?
the
reason
that
it's
not
a
set
sum
are
based
on
a
certain
income
is
that
there
are
so
many
variations.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
how
many
other
members
of
the
family
if
they're
college
students,
there
educational
program
and
all
of
that
sort
of
thing.
so
that's
why
california
has
rejected
something
as
they
do
in
the
social
welfare
programs,
a
so-called
relative
contribution
scale
which
is
more
or
less
inflexible.
but
this
is
a
matter
of
determining
what
each
family
can
really
bear
without
undo
hardship.
and
i
submit
that
it
is
a
fair,
and
unoppressive
program
and
if
the
california
court
--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
in
the
discretion
of
the
administration
but
there
can
be
if
the
party
refuses
to
pay.
there
can
be
no
summary
execution
of
the
department's
judgment.
we
have
to
go
to
court
and
we
have
to
file
an
action
and
litigate
the
matter.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
no,
your
honor.
that
was
not
subjected
to
the
sole
issue
whereas
you
got
to
exhaust
the
mother's
estate
first.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
that
is
correct
your
honor.
there
are
maybe,
and
i
tried
to
figure
this
out
and
i
thought
you
would
be
bored
with
a
lot
of
sentence
and
half-sentencing
and
so
on.
but
there
maybe
a
small
portion
that
would
be
available
for
her
burial
cost
and
for
her
personal
needs.
without
going
beyond
the
record,
i
could
not
bring
that
to
this
court.
but
i
do
say
that
the
estate
borders
on
insolvency.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
it
is
a
lien
your
honor
that
was
obtained
by
the
department
of
mental
hygiene
for
the
patient's
care
and
support
for
a
period
--
large
part
--
a
large
part
of
the
period
is
prior
to
the
claim
for
against
the
daughter's
estate.
the
patient
has
been
in
the
hospital
since
january
of
1953.
this
is
--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
this
is
for
--
that
--
yes.
this
is
for
later
years
plus
the
lien
of
the
department
of
mental
hygiene
was
not
only
for
a
set
sum
up
to
a
period
but
was
for
all
future
charges.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
the
lien
is
not
satisfied
because
it
was
on
a
piece
of
real
property
that
was
only
sold
after
the
daughter
--
the
daughter's
death
of
whose
estate
we're
now
here.
and
that
was
--
that
property
was
sold
for
this
--
almost
$11,000.
thank
you.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
your
honor
--
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
certainly
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
would
i
still
be
here?
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
yes,
your
honor.
need
is
not
the
criteria
for
the
imposition
of
a
joint
and
several
obligation.
it
certainly
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
whether
there
will
be
reimbursement
or
recoupment
by
the
relative
who
pays
or
to
whom
the
department
looks
for
recoupment.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
if
the
court
is
still
interested
in
an
answer
to
their
question
as
to
what
the
california
code
section
requires
for
a
joint
and
--
for
voluntary
admittee.
i
have
the
code
in
my
hand
and
i
would
be
please
to
point
out
to
the
court
the
exact
wording
of
the
statute.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
i'll
make
it
brief
your
honor.
section
6602
of
the
california
welfare
and
institutions
code,
summarizing,
may
be
admitted
to
a
state
hospital
in
accordance
with
the
following
requirements.
in
the
case
of
an
adult
person,
the
application
shall
be
made
voluntarily
by
the
person
at
a
time
if
we
--
when
he
is
in
such
condition
of
mind
as
to
render
him
competent
to
make
it
and
at
any
time
within
seven
days
after
a
request
for
release
by
the
person
that
the
hospital
shall
release
them.
and
that's
purely
a
voluntary
act
on
the
part
of
a
person
who
is
not
dangerously
insane.
ms.
elizabeth
palmer
thank
you.
