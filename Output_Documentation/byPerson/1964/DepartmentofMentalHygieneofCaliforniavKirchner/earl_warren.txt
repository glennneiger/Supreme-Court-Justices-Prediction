petitioner,
versus
evelyn
kirchner,
administratrix
of
the
estate
of
ellinor
green
vance.
mrs.
palmer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mrs.
palmer,
do
you
have
a
similar
law
concerning
county
hospitals
contribution
part
or
rallied
to
county
hospitals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
don't
have
the
same
rules
of
admission
there
do
you,
that
you
have
in
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
didn't
asked
you
what
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
the
decision
in
this
case
affect
the
admissions
and
contributions
to
the
county
hospitals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
certainly,
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
what
is
the
maximum
amount
the
state
does
assess
the
relatives?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
--
i
mean,
$20
a
month.
i
don't
know
what
is
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
$309.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
this
contribution
from
the
relatives
is
$20
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
it
be
interesting
if
you
may
file
in
the
department
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
just
one
more
question
about
the
estate
that
--
is
that
totally
encumbered
and
not
available
for
the
maintenance
of
this
patient
and
therefore,
they
must
look
to
the
relatives
for
contributions
if
any
--
if
anybody
other
than
the
estate
is
to
pay
the
bill?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
dougherty.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
the
time
that
it
was
available
for
her
keep?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
think
you're
almost
obliged
to
interpret
the
california
supreme
court
for
us
aren't
you
if
the
--
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
establish
one
thing
or
another.
what
is
your
judgment
as
to
what
the
supreme
court
found
that
there
was
$11,000
free
money
which
was
available
for
her
maintenance
or
that
there
was
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
must
a
person
be
dangerous
to
society
in
order
to
be
in
a
state
hospital
in
california?
chief
justice
earl
warren
must
a
person
be
dangerous
to
society
to
be
in
a
hospital,
state
hospital
in
california?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
voluntary
commitments?
must
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
must
a
man
allege
that
he
is
dangerous
to
society
to
voluntarily
submit
himself
to
treatment
in
a
hospital?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
your
statute
have
to
say
about
voluntary
commitments?
chief
justice
earl
warren
with
no
process
of
any
kind?
you
can
walk
into
a
hospital
and
you
say
â€œi'm
sick
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
they'll
examine
him
if
he
--
they'd
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
he's
ill
they
can
keep
him
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is
there
a
specific
language
in
the
statute
if
they
find
he
is
not
dangerously
ill.
that's
the
word
that
you're
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
emphasize
that
i
don't
know
whether
you
say
it
or
not.
but
i
thought
a
person
who
considered
himself
mentally
ill
or
whose
doctor
considered
him
mentally
ill
could
walk
into
a
state
hospital
in
california
and
have
himself
committed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
am
i
wrong
in
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
the
duty
of
the
department
to
discharge
him
if
he
was
--
or
was
dangerously
ill
when
he
came
in
but
subsequently
isn't?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
have
the
same
responsibility,
don't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
we're
talking
now
about
discharge?
whenever
they
find
that
he's
no
longer
ill,
they
--
it's
their
duty
to
discharge
him
and
they
do
discharge
all
of
them
whether
they're
committed
to
the
form
of
commitment
or
where
their
voluntary
patient
or
not,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mister,
--
and
i'm
--
before
you
sit
down,
mr.
dougherty,
may
i
ask
you
two
questions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
first,
it
is
your
contention
that
in
this
case,
there
is
an
estate
of
$11
million
--
$11,000
that
is
available
for
the
care
of
this
patient.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
also
you
contend
that
if
it
were
not
with
that
$11,000
if
she
--
if
there
was
no
estate
available
at
all
that
there
still
would
be
no
liability?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
you
do
say
that
even
that
there
was
no
money
here
available
for
her
care
that
the
relatives
would
still
not
be
liable.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
don't
care
what
it
sounds
there.
in
this
case,
that's
your
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
very
much.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mrs.
palmer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mrs.
palmer,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
along
that
same
line.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
your
contention
that
this
$11,
000
is
not
available
for
the
future
care
of
this
patient.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
if
it
were
available
--
if
that
money
were
available
for
that
purpose,
will
you
still
be
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
do
--
would
you
still
contend
that
even
if
that
money
and
it
was
available
in
that
estate
for
her
care
that
still
they
could
asses
the
other
relatives
for
the
--?
chief
justice
earl
warren
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
it
isn't
too
long,
you
might
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
