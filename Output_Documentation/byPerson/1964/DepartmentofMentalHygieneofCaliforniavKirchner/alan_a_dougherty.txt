mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
mr.
chief
justice,
if
pleases
the
court.
i
don't
want
to
bother
this
court
with
the
facts
but
i'm
afraid
that's
been
asked
upon
me
to
review
with
that
which
is
already
been
said.
the
facts
on
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
found
in
its
decision
that
there
was
a
mistake
of
some
$11,000
in
cash.
the
district
court
of
appeal
in
this
case
found
that
there
was
some
$11,000
in
cash
in
the
patient's
estate.
i
found
incumbent
upon
me
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
your
honor,
i
do
not
wish
to
interpret
the
words
of
the
california
supreme
court.
i
would
refer
your
honor
to
page
53
of
the
record
which
says,
“and
furthermore
alleges
that
the
incompetent
mother,
herself
owns
in
her
guardianship
estate,
some
$11,000
in
cash.”
this
is
in
the
supreme
court's
findings
and
the
case
now
at
bench.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
well,
i
think
your
honor
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
the
supreme
court
of
california
found
that
there's
$11,000.
the
district
court
of
appeal
also
found
in
its
decision
that
there
was
cash
available
for
this
purpose.
now
in
petitioner's
brief
on
file,
they
raised
this
issue
and
i
spent
two
or
three
pages
and
i
apologize
to
this
court
for
the
arithmetic
that
i
went
through
to
demonstrate
that
there
were
sufficient
funds
but
the
petitioner
asked
for
it.
i
had
to
respond.
so
again,
this
afternoon,
i
bring
to
the
attention
to
this
court.
there
is
no
factual
situation
before
this
court.
this
judgment
was
a
judgment
on
the
pleadings.
the
california
supreme
court
and
the
california
district
court
of
appeals
looked
to
the
facts
and
the
facts
are
restricted
to
the
plaintiff's
compliant
--
in
the
defendant's
answer.
and
they
found
that
there
was
$11,000
in
cash.
i
don't
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
yes,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
well
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
don't
think
that
the
california
is
--
california
court
is
turning
away
from
the
fact.
it
is
acting
upon
the
fact
that
there
is
$11,000
in
this
estate.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
which
other
question
are
you
referring
to,
your
honor?
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
your
honor,
i
think
this.
i
think
that
this
california
court's
decision
is
based
upon
two
grounds.
number
one
is
the
one
we
are
talking
about
and
the
california
courts
says,
“that
where
a
patient
has
an
estate
of
her
own,
one
adult
cannot
be
required
to
support
the
other
adult”,
and
simply
for
this
reason.
if
the
patient
has
her
estate
of
her
own,
the
daughter
has
no
more
responsibility
to
support
her
mother
who
has
in
the
estate
of
her
own.
then
i
have
a
responsibility
to
support
that
same
mother
or
that
you
would
have
a
responsibility
to
support
that
same
mother.
and
any
statute
that
requires
a
daughter
to
support
a
mother
who
has
an
estate
of
her
own,
improperly
classifies
his
daughter
under
the
statute.
now
as
we
argue
from
the
very
first
appearance
in
this
action,
and
at
that
time,
we
followed
demurer
to
this
complaint.
and
the
grounds
of
the
demurer
were
--
was
a
single
demurer
that
the
complaint
fails
to
see
the
cause
of
action
and
that
the
plaintiff
failed
to
allege
that
the
patient
had
no
estate
of
her
own.
you
see,
under
the
laws
of
state
of
california,
where
a
parent
has
no
estate
or
a
parent
is
a
distressed
person,
a
child
is
liable
for
the
parent's
support.
that
issue
is
not
before
this
court.
if
they
had
enabled
to
allege
that
the
parent
was
a
needy
person
then
they
would
have
stated
the
cause
of
action.
then
our
complaints
against
any
decision
growing
out
of
that
complaint
would
not
have
been
substantiated
as
they
are
here
because,
had
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
mother
was
a
needy
person.
there
would
have
been
a
justification
for
the
classification
that
the
daughter
was
a
class
person
who
is
required
to
take
care
of
the
patient
and
simply
because
the
patient
was
a
needy
person.
but
they
are
unable
to
allege
need
and
they
are
unable
to
allege
that
this
patient
was
a
distressed
person.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
but
your
honor,
it
said
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
i
did
not
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
that
is
the
petitioner's
statement.
that
is
not
my
statement.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
my
statement
would
be
this
your
honor.
in
the
event,
a
court
should
make
a
finding
that
the
parent
is
distressed.
then
under
the
laws
of
our
state,
a
parent
is
distressed
on
these
old-age
benefit
problems
where
she
has
$500
or
$600
where
they
have
a
home.
but
there's
a
finding
that
the
patient
is
a
distressed
person.
there
is
no
finding
here.
a
department
head,
a
simple
department
head
is
the
one
who
decides
that
we
are
going
to
assist
a
relative
for
the
support
of
this
patient.
there's
no
rule
to
go
by
this,
no
standard
to
go
by
the
department
head,
he
can
sue
one
relative.
he
can
give
--
forgive
and
remit
to
another.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
might
like
red
heads
and
never
sue
them.
he
might
dislike
brunettes
and
he
sues
them.
there's
nothing
he
control.
the
actions
of
the
department
head.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
i
see
this.
i
think
that
your
honor
perhaps
has
been
misled.
i
think
the
best
reference
in
answer
to
your
honor's
questions
would
be
the
record
itself
before
the
court.
in
the
record
before
the
court,
we
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
california
supreme
court.
now,
petition
for
rehearing
as
follows
and
this
is
in
a
form
of
a
conclusion.
and
i'm
reading
from
page
42
of
the
record.
as
the
law
now
stands
on
the
decision
of
the
district
court
in
the
present
case,
all
relatives
mentioned
in
welfare
code
6650
can
be
required
to
support
this
incompetence
under
the
care
of
the
department
of
mental
hygiene
regardless
of
the
financial
circumstances
of
the
parties.
and
further,
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
incompetent
repay
the
relatives
upon
his
release
out
of
his
own
personal
estate.
the
relatives
mentioned
under
welfare
code
6650
would
be
subject
to
the
uncontrolled
authority
of
the
department
of
mental
hygiene
to
commence
collection
proceedings
against
them
at
any
time
regardless
of
the
needs
of
the
incompetent
or
the
ability
of
the
relative
to
pay.
this
does
not
reflect
the
odds
to
--
of
fair
play
generally
expressed
in
due
process.
this
more
or
less
summarizes
our
position
your
honor.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
this
is
our
petition
for
a
hearing
before
the
supreme
court
of
california
in
page
42
of
the
record.
on
page
40
of
the
record,
we
set
up
the
proposition.
we
set
up
the
purpose
of
the
welfare
and
institutions
code
of
the
state
of
california
wherein
section
19
provides
--
the
purpose
of
this
code
is
provided
for
the
protection,
care
and
assistance
in
the
state
of
california
need
thereof
and
to
promote
the
welfare
and
happiness
of
all
the
people
of
the
state
for
providing
public
assistance
of
all
its
needy
and
distressed.
now,
the
patient
in
this
case
was
none
of
these
things.
she
had
an
estate
of
$11,000
of
her
own.
and
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
now,
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
your
honor,
struck
me
with
such
surprise
that
in
my
reply
to
this
petition
and
my
reply
is
on
the
file.
i
merely
said
that
i've
never
heard
this
question
before.
this
is
strictly
hypothetical.
question
number
one
reads,
“is
the
statute
requiring
the
husband,
wife,
father,
mother
or
children
of
a
patient
in
the
state
mental
hospital
to
pay
for
the
cost
of
treatment
of
patient
within
reasonable
standards
of
financial
ability?”
it's
first
time
i
heard
of
anything
about
reasonable
standards
of
financial
ability
in
this
case,
so
purely
arbitrary
and
devoid
of
rational
basis
that
it
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
of
united
states
constitution.
this
did
not
come
out.
this
is
the
first
time
this
had
been
mentioned
but
since
we
have
this
problem
before
us.
let's
look
to
some
of
the
reasonable
standards
that
petitioner
talks
about
if
we
may
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
yes.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
i'd
--
i
am
not
the
petitioner
your
honor.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
right.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
yes.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
yes,
your
honor.
but,
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
court
is
talking
about
people
who
are
in
a
mental
institution
in
the
state
of
california.
i
don't
know
what
it
is
in
other
42
states.
in
the
state
of
california,
we
have
no
one
in
our
institutions
other
than
the
dangerously
insane
persons.
we
are
not
talking
about
senile
people.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
right.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
right.
so
the
court
is
saying
in
effect
this,
since
this
people
are
in
our
state
hospitals
for
the
protection
of
society,
it
is
therefore
a
public
charge
and
they
should
be
supported
by
tax
money.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
yes.
it
doesn't
get
there
quite
that
fast
so
i
don't
believe,
your
honor.
it
then
goes
on
and
says,
since
they
are
there
for
the
protection
of
the
public
and
since
this
is
a
public
charge.
it
then
asked
itself,
“is
there
any
other
way
that
we
can
require
of
relatives
under
these
circumstances
to
support
these
people?”
that's
why
i
think
it
goes
through
these
cases
subsequent
on
page
56
and
it
says,
“it
makes
no
difference
where
these
relatives
are
wealthy
or
whether
they
are
poor.”
it
makes
no
difference
since
these
people
are
incarcerated
for
the
protection
of
the
public.
that's
my
answer
to
that
your
honor.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
that
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
that
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
that
is
correct
your
honor.
and
this
is
i
think
made
more
understandable
when
you
consider
the
case
of
the
department
versus
hawley
that
went
in
front
of
it.
and
if
i
may
for
just
one
moment,
comment
upon
this
case.
in
the
case
of
the
department
of
defense
versus
hawley,
the
son
of
hawley
allegedly
murdered
his
mother
and
while
he
was
standing
trial
for
this
alleged
crime,
he
was
found
to
be
mentally,
dangerously
ill
and
was
committed
to
a
state
hospital.
the
department
of
mental
hygiene
endeavored
to
collect
from
the
father
of
the
son
who
is
committed
and
this
court
held
that
this
boy
was
there
for
the
protection
of
the
public
and
we
have
no
more
right
to
collect
from
the
parent
and
if
the
boy
were
in
a
prison
some
place,
this
is
strictly
for
the
protection
of
the
public.
now,
in
the
case
at
bench,
the
court
goes
one
step
further
and
it's
right.
the
court
goes
one
step
further
and
says,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
the
patient
be
committed
through
the
penal
section
or
whether
it
would
be
committed
through
civil
section.
the
purpose
of
confinement
is
the
same
and
the
court
is
right
and
for
this
reason.
hawley
is
--
the
son
of
hawley
is
in
the
institution
because
he
is
criminally
insane.
the
fact
that
he
allegedly
killed
his
mother
is
not
the
reason
he's
there.
as
i
state
in
my
brief,
this
is
merely
evidence
of
his
propensities
of
being
dangerously
ill
and
that's
why
he's
there.
had
the
son
of
hawley
been
examined
before
he
allegedly
killed
his
mother,
he
still
would
be
there
because
he
would
have
been
found
to
be
dangerously
mentally
ill.
and
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
i
didn't
understand
the
first
question.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
definitely
your
honor.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
he's
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
now
i
have
to
answer
this
way
your
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
person
committing
himself
has
to
alleges,
i
do
not
know.
but
i
do
know
this
that
should
he
get
in
and
should
he
not
prove
to
be
dangerously,
mentally
ill
after
he
gets
in.
the
director
still
must
discharge
him.
so
there's
a
two-way
street
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
we're
not
on
odds
in
that
the
question
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
the
petitioner
now
says
that
used
to
be
the
law
but
all
i
am
familiar
with
what
--
is
what
is
the
law.
and
we
find
--
and
we
--
and
in
trying
to
ascertain
what
is
the
law,
in
my
brief,
i
have
set
forth
in
detail
what
the
attorney
general
has
interpreted
this
law
to
be
and
the
attorney
general's
opinion
in
our
state
of
california
is
a
quasi
judicial
words.
and
the
attorney
general
of
our
state
says
that
a
senile
person
--
well,
let
me
read
what
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
california
says,
and
now
of
course
it
changed.
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
california
says
at
page
13
of
the
respondent's
brief
in
this
court,
“it
is
our
opinion
that
non-psychotic
senile
as
defined
supra
within
the
scope
of
section
5054
--
540
in
a
mentally
ill
persons.
with
the
exception
of
the
nine
--
non-psychotic
senile
may
not
be
committed
to
a
state
mental
hospital."
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
that's
right.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
yes,
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
we
commit
in
california
all
types
of
people.
we
commit
senile
people.
we
commit
dangerously
ill
people.
all
under
section
5041
whatever
it
is
here.
however,
the
law
specifically
provides
that
a
person
who
is
not
dangerously
mentally
ill
cannot
get
in
a
state
hospital.
under
the
same
procedure,
the
committing
court
can
commit
the
patient
to
the
county
counselor.
and
the
county
counselor
can
take
this
committed
person
and
put
the
committed
person
in
the
person's
--
patient's
own
home
or
he
can
put
it
in
a
rest
home
or
you
can
put
him
in
a
rest
haven
home
or
you
can
put
him
a
licensed
sanitarium.
or
in
the
event
that
he
is
dangerously
mentally
ill,
he
can
put
him
in
a
state
hospital.
so
there
is
no
question
about
that
as
i
see
it
your
honor
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
so,
they
say
it
but
your
honor,
there's
no
authority
to
support
this
position.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
we
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
offhand
your
honor
as
i
recall,
a
person
who
finds
himself
mentally
ill
can
submit
himself
to
the
department
of
mental
hygiene
and
the
department
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
right.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
that's
right.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
they
can
keep
him
there
but
if
he
turns
out
to
be
a
person
who
is
not
a
dangerously
ill
person
as
i
understand
the
codes,
he
is
to
be
released.
now
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
alright.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
that
is
correct
your
honor
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
that
is
correct
your
honor.
but
as
i
stated
before,
it
is
the
duty
of
the
department
to
discharge
him
when
he
is
found
that
he
is
not
dangerously
ill.
even
though
he's
not
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
then
he
would
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
the
department
you
mean
your
honor?
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
well,
the
department
doesn't
have
to
accept
anybody.
i
mean
if
the
person
comes
in
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
yes,
your
honor.
but
they
don't
have
to
be
completely
cured.
they
can
be
discharged
upon
showing
signs
of
improvement.
beginning
back
to
this
question,
i
don't
like
leaving
the
point
because
of
just
--
mr.
justice
stewart
over
here
is
correct,
the
answer
when
we're
--
it
feels
that
we're
arguing
(inaudible)
--
should
be
argued
downstairs.
now,
what
i'm
reading
from
section
5076
of
the
welfare
and
institutions
code
of
our
state
and
it
says,
“if
one
examination
is
provided
by
law,
the
court
finds
a
person
to
be
mentally
disordered
and
bordering
on
mental
illness
but
not
dangerously
mentally
ill
the
court
may
commit
him
to
the
care
and
custody
of
the
consul
of
mental
health
and
may
allow
him
to
remain
in
his
home,
etcetera,
etcetera."
the
implication
is
--
and
the
attorney
general
and
the
attorney
general's
opinion
cited
in
the
briefs
on
file
supports
a
contention
that
only
the
dangerously
mentally
ill
are
allowed
in
california
state
hospitals.
and
counsel
seems
to
repeat
and
reiterate
that
there
are
people
there
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
--
who
are
not
dangerously
mentally
ill
but
frankly
they
should
not
be
there
because
the
law
specifically
states
that
they
should
not
be
there.
now,
my
time
is
running
out
your
honor.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
no,
i
will
not
your
honor.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
well,
let's
look
to
the
case
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
california
decision
doesn't
mention
the
united
states
constitution.
it
doesn't
even
mention
the
california
constitution.
the
california
supreme
court
mentions
equal
protection
of
the
law.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
i
think
it
says
equal
protection
of
the
law.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
alright,
it
says
both.
and
however,
we
have
cited
in
our
briefs,
the
department
of
mental
hygiene
versus
mcgilvery
interpreting
this
section.
mr.
justice
white
brought
this
up
a
moment
ago
that
the
--
and
elicit
it
from
counsel
that
in
the
mcgilvery
case
the
--
we
have
interpreted
this.
it
is
being
the
same
substance
as
the
fourteenth
amendment.
further
now
getting
back
to
our
case,
what
else
has
happened
in
the
case
at
bench?
we
see
that
the
california
court
has
cited
the
case
of
county
of
los
angeles
versus
frisby
which
is
on
article
i,
section
13
of
the
california
constitution.
they
cited
california,
los
angeles
versus
(inaudible)
which
is
based
upon
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
in
the
first
--
article
i,
section
11
of
the
state
constitution
that
had
cited
triven
(ph)
versus
superior
court
which
case
holds
that
wealth
or
the
lack
thereof
is
no
basis
upon
which
you
can
assess
relatives.
it
goes
on
further
and
it
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
the
answer
to
that
your
honor
is
that
the
california
court
has
replied
that
they
--
though
they
do
not
have
it
in
the
--
a
precise
phraseology,
they
do
have
what
they
considered
an
equal
protection
clause.
they
go
on
your
honor
what
in
this
case
in
mcgilvery,
the
court
says,
the
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
which
prohibits
a
state
from
denying
to
any
person
within
his
jurisdiction,
equal
protection
of
the
laws
has
been
similarly
construed.
it
goes
on
in
its
case
--
in
the
case
before
the
court
and
quotes,
blumenthal
versus
board
of
medical
examiners,
a
california
case
that
based
upon
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
article
i,
section
11.
it
then
goes
on
and
cites
the
case
of
bilyeu
versus
state
employees'
retirement
system
which
also
quotes
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution
of
the
cali
--
in
the
california
constitution,
article
i,
section
11.
further,
in
the
record
and
the
--
and
the
record
and
the
--
before
the
court,
the
petitioner
at
--
on
page
62
of
the
record
refers
to
the
triven
(ph)
versus
superior
court
case
in
which
the
court
holds
that
wealth
is
no
basis
for
either
granting
or
denying
or
composing
liability.
so
obviously,
we
have
before
this
court
a
case
where
there's
been
no
specific
reference
to
either
the
federal
or
to
the
state
constitution.
we
talked
about
an
equal
protection
clause
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
i
would
say
your
honor
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
well
under
the
law,
it
has
to
rest
on
california
constitution
because
in
accordance
with
your
honor's
pronouncement
of
yesterday
in
the
case
of
jankovich
versus
indiana
toll
road
commission
and
the
court
says,
“again,
there
is
no
information
that
the
conclusion
that
the
ordinance
entails
an
unlawful
and
unconstitutional
appropriation
of
property
rights
without
payment
of
compensation
is
based
--
less
forcib
--
forcefully
on
the
indiana
constitution
bend
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
that's
right.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
no,
i
would
not
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
oh,
wait
awhile.
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
you.
hawley
by
itself,
yes.
hawley
by
itself
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
oh
--
and
based
on
the
federal
constitution
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
--
alone.
fourteenth
amendment
as
i
recall.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
but
as
you
may
recall
your
honor,
i
said
before
to
justice
--
that
this
--
the
california
court
has
based
its
decision
on
two
separate
grounds.
number
one,
that
the
hawley
case
is
dispositive
of
it.
and
number
two,
that
where
--
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
but
your
honor,
the
second
holding
where
a
patient
has
an
estate
of
her
own
and
a
statute
requires
a
daughter
to
support
a
mother
who
has
estate
of
her
own.
the
court
holds
and
cites
california
cases
says,
that
this
is
an
improper
classification
and
this
violates
the
equal
protection
of
the
law
and
this
is
on
the
last
page
of
the
decision.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
in
view
of
the
court's
ruling
on
the
hawley
case,
that
is
now
the
law
in
the
state
of
california.
at
the
time
of
the
commencement
of
this
action,
that
would
not
have
been
the
law.
at
the
time
of
the
commencement
of
this
action
if
the
mother
had
no
estate
of
her
own,
she
would
have
been
a
needy
person
and
the
daughter
would
have
been
properly
classified
and
would
have
been
required
to
support
the
mother.
but
then
came
the
hawley
case
and
the
court
says
that
it
is
for
the
sole
protection
of
the
public
and
therefore,
no
relative
of
any
inmate
of
any
california
hospital
can
be
charged
for
the
support
of
the
patient.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
under
the
hawley
ruling,
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
this
was
not
the
position
that
we
took
before
the
supreme
court
but
the
hawley
case
came
up
during
the
dependency
of
this
action
and
this
court,
the
supreme
court
of
california
says,
“it
is
dispositive
of
the
case
before
it.”
however,
the
case
as
i've
said
twice
now
before,
the
court
has
given
two
reasons
for
its
decision
and
the
second
reason
being
that
the
daughter
did
not
have
to
support
her
mother
because
she
had
an
estate
of
her
own.
the
very
last
paragraph
of
the
supreme
court's
decision
says
that
the
daughter
would
have
no
right
to
recoup
from
the
assets
of
the
patient
and
obviously,
the
court
is
talking
about
$11,000.
mr.
alan
a.
dougherty
thank
you.
