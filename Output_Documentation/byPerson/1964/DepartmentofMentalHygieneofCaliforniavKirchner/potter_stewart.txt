justice

what
determines
that
--
we're
dealing
here
with
the
mentally
ill?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
the
maximum
payment
is
$309
a
month
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
is
--
can
be
imposed
on
these
relatives.
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
determines
whether
or
not
the
maximum
should
be
imposed?
how
long
--
i
suppose
this
is
a
20,
30,
40-year
hospitalization?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
that
in
some
cases
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
know.
i
know
there's
been
a
great
change
has
made
but
there
--
and
that
is
the
average
but
i'm
sure
there
are
still
some
people
who
are
hospitalized
for
good
many
years.
justice
potter
stewart
depends
upon
how
many
other
members
of
the
family
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
in
the
discretion
of
the
administration
of
this
plan.
justice
potter
stewart
as
you
already
claim
on
this
case
that
the
--
as
to
the
discriminatory
administration
of
this
plan?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
so
this
is
for
some
later
years?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
dougherty,
may
i?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
read
what
you've
--
the
language
you've
just
referred
us
to.
it's
a
recital
by
the
--
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
as
to
the
allegations
of
the
pleadings.
justice
potter
stewart
a
recital
as
to
the
allegations
of
the
pleading.
no
more,
no
less
but
then
the
court
goes
on
to
say
more
specifically
and
it
seems
to
turn
away
from
many
factual
disputes.
and
it
says
more
specifically,
defendant
directly
challenges
the
right
of
estate
to
statutorily
impose
liability
upon
and
collect
from
one
adult
for
the
cost
of
supporting
another
adult
whom
the
estate
is
committed
to
one
of
its
hospitals
for
the
mentally
ill
or
insane.
and
then
the
court
deals
with
that
broad
question
and
turns
away
from
this
little
factual
dispute.
that's
--
what
you
referred
to
is
a
recital
in
the
pleadings
as
i
understand
you.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
the
big
question
doesn't
arise
under
california
law,
if
there's
enough
fund
to
your
california
law
--
the
--
in
the
estate
and
the
--
of
the
property
of
the
person
in
the
hospital
then
these
other
question
doesn't
arise,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
which
i
thought
we
granted
this
case
to
hear
and
which
i
thought
the
california
supreme
court
decided.
that
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
estates
imposing
upon
one
adult.
the
charge
and
keep
of
another
adult
committed
to
one
of
your
state
mental
institution.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
bringing
in
to
this
case
what
i
didn't
think
is
here
at
all
and
i
asked
your
brother
--
your
sister
an
argument
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
any
claim
of
a
discriminatory
administration
of
this
program
and
i
understood
that
you
say
no.
i
understood
there
was
no
due
process
claim
in
this
case
and
now
your
argument
that
you
are
now
making
all
seem
to
go
to
due
process.
i
--
am
i
wrong
that
its
--
to
what's
involved
here?
justice
potter
stewart
that
--
and
what's
that
from
your
brief
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
looking
at
the
petition
for
certiorari
on
this
court
which
states
two
questions.
i'm
sure
you're
familiar
with
those
and
did
you
seek
to
reframe
the
questions
in
your
response
to
the
petition?
justice
potter
stewart
we
--
the
case
is
here
now.
its
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
any
of
the
california
court.
the
case
is
here
and
it's
here
on
the
ground
of
petition
for
certiorari
which
stated
two
questions.
the
first
of
which
you've
read
and
i
assumed
that
unless
you
can
show
us
otherwise,
it
was
on
the
basis
of
those
questions
if
it
--
if
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
considered
here.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know.
justice
potter
stewart
why
--
this
isn't
the
--
as
far
as
i'm
concern,
at
all
helpful
to
have
an
argument
here
where
you
and
the
other
side
don't
you;
they
didn't
get
together
as
to
what
the
tax
are
or
what
the
law
of
california
is
or
you're
directly
at
odds
on
this
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
person
needs
to
be
dangerous
to
society
to
be
hospitalized
under
this
case
--
california
program.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
you
could
get
that
straightened
out.
we're
certainly
not
in
the
position
to
decide
that
here.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
because
--
yes,
mrs.
--
justice
potter
stewart
mrs.
palmer
said,
you
don't
need
to
be
dangerous
to
the
society
under
the
present
law.
she
said
that
used
to
be
the
law.
now,
i
see
that
one
way
or
the
other,
i
should
think
it
would
be
clear.
justice
potter
stewart
not
for
us
to
decide.
