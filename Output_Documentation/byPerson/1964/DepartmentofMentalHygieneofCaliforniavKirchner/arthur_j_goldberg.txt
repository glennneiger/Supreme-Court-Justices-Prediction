j.

mr.
dougherty,
is
it
your
theory
that
a
state
is
without
constitutional
power
under
the
federal
constitution
that
require
a
child
to
contribute
or
to
care
of
a
parent
if
the
parent
has
any
estate,
is
that
your
theory?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
because
in
other
words,
that
the
estate
must
be
exhausted.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
that's
the
--
what
the
constitution
requires?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
would
you
state
what
yours
is?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
dougherty,
in
reference
to
my
brother
stewart's
question,
would
you
turn
to
page
55
of
the
record
which
is
the
supreme
court
of
california's
decision
in
this
case
with
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
holding
and
would
you
look
at
page
--
at
the
end
of
page
55.
where
they
state,
"hence,
the
cause
of
maintaining
the
state
institution
including
provision
of
adequate
fair
â€“
for
its
injuries
cannot
be
arbitrarily
charged
to
one
class
in
a
society."
this
is
nothing
about
whether
they
have
money
or
not.
such
assessment
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
and
then
go
on.
all
the
numerous
cases
that
can
be
cited,
research
has
disclosed
no
case
which
squarely
faced,
considered
discussed
and
sustained
such
statutes
in
light
of
the
basic
question
as
to
the
equal
protection
of
the
law
in
a
case
wherein
it
is
sought
to
impose
liability
upon
one
person
for
the
support
of
another
in
a
state
institution.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
isn't
that
the
basic
question
in
this
case
as
to
whether
--
put
aside
you
--
the
$10,000.
whether,
as
i
read
the
opinion,
i
thought
that
the
court
of
california
was
saying
that
the
person
who
is
in
state
custody
is
a
lord
of
the
state
and
it
is
a
denial
of
equal
protection
to
impose
the
cost
of
maintaining
that
person
in
state
custody
upon
a
relative?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
isn't
that
the
basic
decision
here?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
that's
non-psychotic
but
you
may
be
mentally
ill
without
being
dangerous.
in
your
--
would
you
look
at
page
52
of
the
record?
to
--
the
supreme
court
of
california
cites
your
quote
and
it
has
two
definitions
of
a
mentally
ill
person.
and
the
dangerous
is
in
b
but
a
says,
who
are
of
such
mental
condition
that
they
are
in
need
of
supervision,
treatment,
care
or
restraint.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
wouldn't
that
do

justice
arthur
j.

that
wouldn't
cover
up
the

and

(inaudible)
do
you
agree
with
mrs.
palmer
that
this
case
is
decided
in
california
supreme
court
under
the
federal
constitution?
justice
arthur
j.

what
do
you
