justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
the
mcgilvery,
they
did
point
out
that
the
california
constitution
provision
for
equal
operation
of
the
laws
has
been
construed
equivalent
--
in
an
equivalent
manner
to
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
--
if
the
california
court
had
determined
to
do
so
here
and
followed
its
own
logic,
they
could've
decided
this
on
state
grounds.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
they
didn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
we
took
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
--
that
it
was
a
federal
constitutional
decision
and
decided
it
contrary
to
the
california
court,
reversed
and
remanded.
i
suppose
the
california
court
could
then
proceed
(voice
overlap)
decision
on
the
california
constitution
in
this
very
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
could.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
could.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
but
i
suppose
you
think
also
if
we
said
that
the
--
that
this
does
not
deny
equal
protection
that
this
might
have
some
influence
in
the
california
court
under
its
own
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
--
here
is
the
attorney
general
of
california
saying
that
you're
entirely
wrong
when
you
say
that
all
patients
of
state
mental
hospital
such
as
agnews
are
--
and
must
be
dangerously
insane.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
but
all
you're
doing
is
asking
us
sort
of
a
--
as
mr.
justice
stewart
says
to
decide
this
question
of
the
california
law
when
the
attorney
general
comes
in
here
and
says
you're
wholly
wrong
in
your
assertion
about
who
may
enter
this
hospital.
then
he
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
cites
a
case,
he
cites
a
statute,
this
is
on
page
4
of
his
reply
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
says
also
equal
protection
clause.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
decision
rest
on
either
one
or
both
as
--
it
has
to,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
do
you
say
it
rest
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
an
indian
--
in
that
case,
they
mentioned
the
indiana
constitution
quoted
the
section
that
they
are
relying
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
here,
they
mentioned
an
equal
protection
clause
which
the
california
constitution
has
not
decided
hawley.
would
you
agree
that
hawley
was
a
federal
question
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
hawley
went
on
to
federal
constitution,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
solely?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
in
this
case
and
the
case
that
you
have,
the
court
said
that
hawley
was
dispositive
of
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
seems
to
indicate
they
were
deciding
a
federal
question,
isn't
it?
