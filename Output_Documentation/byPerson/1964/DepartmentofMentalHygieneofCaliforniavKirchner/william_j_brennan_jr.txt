was
reading

j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
claim
the
issue
--
how
do
they
claim
it?
a
state
constitutional
question,
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
that's
the
supreme

as
the
equal
protection
jargon
(inaudible)?

(inaudible)

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
this
is
a
candidate
for
remand
to
that
court
and
tell
us
what
they
did,
on
what
they've
asked
to
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
whether
it
is
or
not,
i
gather

position
really
is,
this
is
the
type
of
problem
that
comes
within
the
principles
of
(inaudible)
and
that
line
of

isn't
it?
