mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
this
case
comes
here
on
petition
of
the
federal
power
commission
and
presents
a
rather
basic
issue
as
to
the
scope
of
the
commission's
licensing
jurisdiction
over
hydroelectric
projects
one
which
calls
for
a
construction
of
section
23
(b)
of
the
water
power
act
of
1920.
in
that
section
congress
used
the
language
common
to
so
many
federal
regulatory
statutes
affecting
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
our
question
here
is
whether
it
did
so
in
a
specialized
or
limiting
sense
or
whether
on
the
contrary
the
concept
of
affecting
commerce
is
to
be
given
its
customary
full
play.
the
eighth
circuit
has
held
as
respondent
union
electric
company
here
urges
that
the
word
commerce
in
this
statute
is
to
be
read
but
although
other
statute
does
not
say
so.
as
if
it
referred
solely
to
commerce
on
the
river
only
that
and
nothing
else.
our
view
is
that
congress
quite
purposefully
in
the
water
power
act
exercised
the
full
scope
of
its
constitutional
commerce
powers
and
that
it
imposed
a
licensing
requirement
as
well
as
the
other
regulatory
incidents
of
the
act
upon
any
hydroelectric
project
which
would
affect
commerce
in
the
constitutional
sense.
now
i
shall
deal
with
the
facts
more
fully
in
a
few
moments
but
i
would
like
to
make
a
few
essentials
clear
at
the
outset.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
1920
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
hydroelectric
project
in
question
is
known
as
the
taum
sauk
project
and
it
is
located
on
a
non-navigable
stream
in
missouri
known
as
the
east
fork.
the
east
fork
river
is
some
4
miles
of
the
location
of
the
project
on
the
east
fork
is
some
4
miles
above
the
confluence
of
that
stream
with
the
black
river
which
is
a
navigable
river.
now
there
is
dispute
as
to
whether
the
facts
justify
the
conclusion
that
the
taum
sauk
project
will
significantly
affect
downstream
navigability
on
the
black
river.
the
trial
examiner
and
the
commission
concluded
that
it
would
the
court
of
appeals
disagree.
there
is
no
dispute
however,
no
dispute
on
the
proposition
that
electricity
which
is
generated
at
the
taum
sauk
works
will
serve
union
electric's
coordinated
three-state
system
of
generation
transmission
and
distribution.
the
taum
sauk
project
will
draw
upon
sources
of
energy
and
other
states
at
certain
times
and
at
other
times
the
taum
sauk
project
will
generate
hydroelectric
power
which
will
be
transmitted
to
other
states.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
union
electric
has
a
three-state
system
in
missouri
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
iowa
and
the
illinois.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
this
record
shows
a
three-state
integrated
system.
it
does
not
show
whether
the
system
also
has
arrangements
for
interchanged
with
the
facilities
and
other
parts
of
the
country.
now
the
principal
legal
issue
which
the
government
brought
here
is
whether
a
hydroelectric
project
defects
commerce
in
a
statutory
sense
where
project
energy
will
flow
in
interstate
commerce
even
if
it
be
assumed
that
it
will
not
affect
--
the
project
will
not
affect
the
navigable
capacity
of
the
river
or
the
mainstream
of
which
the
river
is
tributary.
a
secondary
issue,
i've
already
indicated
i
think
and
that
is
whether
on
the
established
facts,
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
rejected
the
commission's
conclusion
that
the
project
would
affect
the
navigable
capacity
of
the
black
river
and
then
not
on
that
impendent
ground
that
require
a
license.
now,
i
referred
passingly
to
the
statutory
language,
let
me
turn
if
i
may
to
the
precise
provisions.
section
23
(b)
appears
that
pages
2
and
3
of
the
government's
brief.
you
will
find
that
it
is
one
long
paragraph
analytically
i
think
it
may
be
broken
down
into
two
parts.
the
opening
sentence
the
first
part
says
in
substance
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
to
construct
or
to
operate
any
dam,
water
conduit,
reservoir,
powerhouse
or
other
works
along
or
in
any
navigable
water
of
the
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
developing
electric
power
without
a
license.
you
will
note
that
this
licensing
requirement
applies
irrespective
of
whether
the
works
constructed
would
actually
impair
navigation
or
have
any
demonstrable
effect
upon
it.
now,
the
next
segment
beginning
with
the
second
sentence
deals
with
the
matter
of
placing
such
works
in
a
non-navigable
stream
as
the
statute
puts
it
in
any
stream
or
part
thereof
other
than
those
defined
herein
as
navigable
waters
and
over
which
congress
has
jurisdiction
under
its
authority
to
regulate
commerce.
a
person
so
proposing
the
statute
continues
shall
file
a
declaration
of
intention
with
the
committee
at
which
point
the
commission
fell
immediately
investigate
the
proposed
construction.
then
the
language
which
is
crucial
for
present
purposes,
if
the
commission
finds
that
"the
interest
of
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
would
be
affected",
the
construction
is
forbidden
unless
and
until
a
license
is
sought
and
obtained.
now,
in
those
words
of
broad
sweep
protecting
the
interest
of
interstate
commerce
there
is
surely
no
intimation
that
the
commission
was
to
be
confined
either
then
or
for
all
time
to
an
appraisal
of
the
effect
upon
commerce
on
the
river.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
think
that
joins
with
this
question
because
the
jurisdiction
of
commerce
over
the
river.
the
jurisdiction
of
congress
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
over
a
non-navigable
stream
would
be
made
out
by
showing
that
the
waters
of
that
river
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
were
being
used
in
some
way
which
would
affect
commerce
so
i
think
the
question
of
congress
--
of
the
jurisdiction
of
congress
brings
us
back
to
the
question
of,
is
commerce
affected
and
therefore
i
think
the
--
either
line
of
approach
from
either
set
of
words
leads
us
to
the
same
point.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it's
plenary
(voice
overlap)
--
plenary
authority
over
it
would
certainly,
but
if
the
non-navigable
stream
were
being
used
to
generate
power
which
is
being
sent
in
interstate
commerce
i
think
the
court
would
have
no
question
that
congress
could
exercise
jurisdiction
over
the
use
of
the
stream
in
that
respect
and
for
that
purpose.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
no.
i
do
not
think
it
was
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
clear
under
the
decisions
at
that
time.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
it
is
a
part
of
the
problem
of
statutory
interpretation
and
i
shall
argue
that
congress
intended
to
exert
all
of
the
power
that
it
had
under
the
commerce
clause
and
i
shall
recognize
later
in
the
argument
as
i
acknowledge
now
that
congress
certainly
at
that
time
didn't
understand
that
the
commerce
clause
would
have
the
same
dimensions
as
the
decisions
of
this
court
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
congress
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes
sir,
indeed
the
sherman
act
would
be
another
example
certainly
congress
didn't
appreciate.
sherman
act
would
reach
all
freshets
of
commerce
that
we
now
know
it
reaches.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
1920
your
honor.
the
water
power
act
of
1920
is
the
basic
provision.
there
was
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
perhaps
before
leaving
the
statutory
language
i
should
refer
as
well
to
the
final
sentence
which
i
think
is
perhaps
the
suggested.
the
section
concludes
that
if
cong
--
if
the
commission
shall
not
find
that
the
interest
of
interstate
commerce
are
affected
in
a
given
case
then
congress
says,
permission
is
hereby
granted
to
construct
such
other
--
such
damn
or
other
project
works
in
such
stream
upon
compliance
with
state
laws.
and
this
i
think
suggests
that
congress
meant
to
give
the
federal
commission
jurisdiction
overall
projects,
say,
those
which
would
have
purely
local
effects.
and
congress
has
expressed
delegation
of
authority
over
those
local
projects
to
the
states
suggests
further
that
congress
regarded
its
own
power
as
extending
to
the
entire
watershed
of
the
river
which
was
certainly
not
a
niggardly
conception
of
the
commerce
power
or
one
which
suggest
any
intent
on
congress'
part
to
invoke
anything
less
than
the
full
measure
of
its
authority.
now,
it
maybe
a
source
of
some
surprise
that
a
statutory
question
as
basic
as
this
one
has
not
been
laid
to
rest
previously
the
statute
having
passed
some
40
odd
years
ago.
the
reason
for
that
is
this.
under
the
state
of
new
york
in
1920
and
indeed
until
very
recently
hydroelectric
generation
of
power
was
confined
to
harnessing
the
natural
fall
of
the
river
or
flow
of
the
river.
more
over
projects
which
reduced
energy
in
sufficient
quantity
to
serve
interstate
markets
were
almost
invariably
located
on
navigable
streams
or
its
situated
on
a
tributary
would
impound
enough
water
to
affect
substantially
the
navigability
of
the
main
stream
so
that
virtually
any
project
of
the
conventional
type
which
was
large
enough
to
have
a
significant
effect
on
the
interest
of
commerce
was
subject
--
well,
i
should
say
large
enough
so
that
it
would
have
an
effect
on
the
interest
of
commerce
with
subject
to
jurisdiction
because
it
would
certainly
affect
downstream
navigable
capacity
regardless
of
whether
it
affected
commerce
in
any
other
sense.
now,
in
the
istant
case
the
commission
dealt
with
the
prototype
of
a
new
kind
of
hydroelectric
project.
one
which
is
going
to
become
more
and
more
familiar
as
time
goes
on
and
will
undoubtedly
play
an
increasing
role
in
meeting
the
country's
massive
and
accelerating
energy
requirements.
the
taum
sauk
project
is
a
so-called
pumped
storage
project,
the
first
pure
pump
storage
project
in
the
united
states.
by
their
nature
pump
storage
projects
as
opposed
to
the
conventional
hydroelectric
project
are
aught
to
have
far
less
impact
upon
downstream
commerce
on
the
river
or
downstream
navigable
capacity.
now
pump
storage
very
simply
stated
involves
the
creation
of
a
man-made
waterfall,
water
is
pumped
up
from
river
level
to
a
high
hill
or
a
mountain.
there
the
water
is
stored
and
in
an
appropriate
time
released.
it
falls
from
this
upper
high
altitude
pool
back
into
a
lower
pool
in
the
river
which
is
formed
by
a
dam.
the
pumps
which
force
the
water
upwards
during
the
(inaudible)
--
pumping
cycle
are
reversible
and
serve
as
turbines
during
the
downward
cycle.
in
short,
the
pump
storage
is
like
a
huge
storage
battery.
during
hours
when
demand
is
slack
on
union
electric
system
which
would
characteristically
be
the
night
time
hours,
taum
suak
project
draws
energy
from
other
generating
facilities
and
union
electric
system
from
steam
facility,
steam
generating
facilities
and
uses
that
energy
to
pump
the
water
up
the
hill.
conversely,
during
periods
when
demand
upon
the
system
is
heavy
during
the
peak
hours
the
water
can
be
released
from
the
upper
reservoir
and
hydropower
generated
at
the
taum
sauk.
although
it
requires
more
energy
to
pump
the
water
up
the
hill
than
is
obtained
from
letting
it
fall
back
into
the
river,
projects
of
this
kind
provide
a
great
assist
to
integrated
electric
systems
because
of
the
very
wide
variation
in
demand
as
between
the
peak
and
the
off
peak
periods.
now
this
new
technique
of
developing
additional
sources
of
energy
has
made
it
possible
for
tributaries
with
relatively
small
stream
flows
to
produce
hydroelectric
energy
in
quantities
which
were
previously
obtainable
only
from
large
hydro
plants
on
mainstreams
or
their
important
tributaries.
the
taum
sauk
project
itself
is
one
of
very
considerable
magnitude.
an
aerial
photograph
of
it
appears
in
a
document
which
i
think
has
been
distributed
to
the
court.
the
first
volume
of
the
federal
power
commission's
recent
national
power
survey
which
is
a
larger
volume
than
the
briefs
if
not
available
i
--
what
is
it?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
it's
the
same
except
you
have
a
hard
cover
one
in
your
hands
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
its
page
119
of
that
first
volume
of
the
power
survey
and
you'll
see
in
that
aerial
photograph
--
i'm
sorry
page
122,
the
chapter
begins
at
119.
the
taum
sauk
project
in
the
lower
right
hand
corner
and
as
you'll
see
there's
a
huge
reservoir
there
which
is
perched
on
a
mountain
top
some
800
feet
above
river
level.
the
surface
of
that
is
about
50
acres
which
is
roughly
the
size
of
50
football
fields
and
below
though
not
in
full
evidence
in
the
picture
is
the
lower
reservoir
of
some
370
acres
which
is
impounded
by
a
60-foot
damn.
and
this
project
has
a
generating
capacity
of
about
350,000
kilowatts
which
is
almost
three
times
as
much
as
union
electric's
famous
hydroelectric
development
conventional
development
on
the
mississippi
river
at
keacock.
this
survey
if
i
may
take
another
moment
with
it
contains
also
a
discussion
of
peaking
power
and
of
this
principle
of
pumped
storage
and
its
importance
in
an
electrical
system.
it
also
lists
projects
of
this
kind
and
operation
under
construction
and
in
contemplation
both
the
pure
pump
storage
project
of
this
type
and
the
pumped
storage
project
which
are
used
adjuncts
or
compliments
of
conventional
developments.
one
of
the
pump
storage
projects
currently
in
contemplation
of
course
is
the
one
proposed
by
consolidated,
edison
on
cornwall
--
at
cornwall
on
the
hudson
which
has
caused
something
of
a
furor
in
the
new
york
press.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
this
is
the
first
pure
pump
storage.
there
are
others
in
contemplation.
there
are
a
good
many
more
than
are
used
in
conjunction
with
conventional
projects
for
example
there's
some
pumped
storage
in
niagara
falls.
one
point
to
emphasize
about
this
type
of
project
of
course
is
that
and
it's
an
obvious
point
is
that
it
requires
two
suitable
sites
one
for
the
upper
and
one
for
the
lower
reservoir.
the
availability
of
such
sight
is
of
course
very
strictly
limited
by
nature.
and
i
shall
develop
the
framers
of
the
water
power
act
were
keenly
aware
that
the
matter
of
appropriation
of
such
sites
is
one
of
vital
concern
from
the
standpoint
of
the
proper
and
effective
utilization
of
the
nation's
water
resource.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
not
in
relation
to
pump
storage
but
very
keenly
aware
in
relation
to
the
places
where
there
was
an
opportunity
for
a
conventional
hydroelectric
project
and
the
number
of
sites
available
for
pump
storage
are
also
limited
by
nature.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
let
me
explain
that
immediately.
a
natural
question
and
one
i
intended
to
come
to,
the
commission
concluded
in
this
case
that
the
project
was
sound
and
should
be
permitted
to
go
forward
while
the
issue
of
the
requirement
of
a
license
was
pending
and
if
permitted
that.
this
does
not
in
any
sense
make
the
case
academic
and
let
me
say
why.
if
this
project
requires
a
license
there
is
a
licensed
term,
a
maximum
of
50
years
there
is
not
a
right
in
perpetuity
to
use
this
site.
if
it
is
licensable,
union
electric
is
subject
to
the
imposition
of
annual
charges
under
the
water
power
act
which
help
to
defray
the
administration
of
that
act.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
would
be
a
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
found
until
that
in
this
case
it
would
be
a
product
of
both
factors
that
did
--
would
depend
in
part
on
the
matter
that
occurred.
union
electric
also
would
be
subject
to
the
requirement
of
establishing
amortization
reserves
under
the
act
after
a
certain
number
of
years
into
the
provisions
which
authorized
in
certain
circumstances
ultimately
capture
the
project.
it
also
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
at
the
end
of
the
license
period
there
are
provisions
in
the
water
power
act
which
permit
recapture.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
could
be
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
could
taken
over
as
a
public
project
upon
payments
made
to
union
electric
in
accordance
with
the
recapture
provisions
and
finally
if
also
--
union
electric
also
would
become
subject
to
the
safety
and
inspection
requirements
of
the
act
in
respect
to
the
maintenance
of
the
dam
that
works.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
have
spoken
of
the
nature
of
the
project
and
referred
to
some
of
the
consequence
of
licensing.
let
me
return
now
if
i
may
to
the
statutory
issue.
i
emphasize
statutory
because
i
take
it
that
there
can
be
no
serious
question
at
least
this
state
of
the
constitutional
power
of
congress
to
reach
the
result
we
are
urging
here.
i
take
it
there
is
no
doubt
that
congress
could
regulate
all
power
projects,
hydroelectric
or
otherwise
which
generate
energy
for
transmission
in
interstate
commerce.
we
know
for
one
thing
that
the
labor
act
has
been
applied
to
such
facilities.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
that's
quite
clear.
and
it
follows
of
course
of
it
--
congress
can
certainly
regulate
then
the
lesser
included
category
of
projects
which
not
only
produce
energy
for
commerce
but
also
generated
by
use
of
the
nations
limited
water
resources.
now,
i've
stressed
the
point
already
that
the
language
which
congress
employed
is
of
the
broadest.
in
terms
it
embraces
any
hydroelectric
project
which
affects
the
interest
of
interstate
commerce
without
limitation.
justice
frankfurter
observed
in
the
labor
board
case
some
20
or
more
years
ago
that
half
a
dozen
enactments
illustrates
the
proposition
that
when
congress
wishes
to
bring
aspects
of
commerce
within
the
full
sweep
of
it's
constitutional
authority,
it
manifests
it's
purpose
by
regulating
not
only
commerce
but
matters
which
affect
or
interrupt
or
promote
commerce.
and
so
we're
urging
here
an
accepted
meaning
of
the
statutory
language
and
the
burden
of
showing
we
suggest
that
the
statute
should
be
restricted
to
cases
in
which
the
project
affects
commerce
on
the
navigable
waters.
that
burden
falls
upon
respondent.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
certainly
an
element
to
consider.
i
already
attempted
to
indicate
the
commission
in
its
early
cases
had
very
little
occasion
to
be
concerned
about
whether
it
could
reach
a
project
like
this
because
in
the
conventional,
in
the
case
of
the
conventional
hydro
project
where
there's
enough
energy
developed
to
serve
interstate
markets
the
project
would
invariably
affect
downstream
navigability
and
the
commission
having
a
traditional
and
not
debatable
basis
of
jurisdiction
certainly
had
no
occasion
to
go
out
of
its
way
to
assert
a
proposition
which
is
--
we
know
from
this
case
is
seriously
debated.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
surely,
the
--
actually
the
commission
didn't
address
itself
to
the
question
at
all
for
many
years.
there
is
a
single
dictum
of
the
commission
at
which
that
we
don't
have
that
we
have
jurisdiction
only
if
in
effect
on
navigability
is
shown.
that
was
shear
dictum
because
an
affect
on
navigability
was
shown
in
that
case.
on
the
other
hand
we
have
the
commission
virtually
contemporaneously
with
the
announcement
of
that
dictum
taking
in
litigation
the
position
which
are
merging
here.
this
position
was
urged
by
the
commission
some
years
ago
on
the
(inaudible)
case
which
came
to
this
court.
and
this
court
did
not
have
to
reach
it
because
it
concluded
on
the
facts
of
that
case
contrary
to
what
the
lower
courts
had
concluded
that
the
--
there
was
a
demonstration
--
affect
on
navigability,
the
navigability
of
the
new
river
in
that
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
i
think
not.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
was
the
california
oregon
case
which
is
cited
in
the
brief
--
pardon?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
thank
you
your
honor.
now,
i
think
that
the
--
what
i
have
called
the
burden
of
respondent
to
justify
writing
a
caveat
into
the
statute.
i
don't
think
it
can
be
sustained
either
by
reference
to
the
underlying
historic
purposes
of
this
act
or
by
reference
to
the
specific
history
of
23
(b).
now
this
statute
as
your
honors
know
was
not
passed
merely
to
deal
with
matters
involving
obstruction
or
impairment
of
navigation,
subjects
with
which
congress
have
previously
dealt
in
the
rivers
and
harbors
act.
from
first
to
last,
this
statute
was
the
work
of
the
conservationist
block
in
congress
which
struggled
for
its
enactment
for
a
period
of
almost
15
years.
it
is
a
water
power
act
and
not
a
navigation
act.
the
beginnings
go
back
to
president
theodore
roosevelt's
famous
veto
message
in
the
rainy
river
matter.
prophetically
he
stated
at
that
time
that
the
country
was
on
the
eve
of
great
developments
in
water
power
and
he
urged
--
that
an
administrative
authority
be
created
to
pass
upon
plans
for
river
projects
and
to
assure
for
future
generations
a
complete
development
of
the
limited
sites,
a
complete
development
of
the
power
possibilities.
those
who
took
up
the
task
of
enacting
a
water
power
act,
gifford
pinchot,
henry
stimson,
robert
la
follette
and
others
unfailingly
stressed
the
same
theme.
and
as
your
honors
know,
the
statute
which
ultimately
emerged
specifically
charges
the
commission
in
exercising
it's
licensing
and
its
investigatory
functions
to
conserve
and
utilize
the
water
resources
of
the
nation
for
navigation,
power
development,
recreation
and
all
other
beneficial
uses.
in
the
similar
vein
the
statute
directs
the
commission
not
to
approve
of
private
development
if
in
its
judgment
the
united
states
in
the
public
interest
should
undertake
the
development
of
the
particular
site.
now
all
of
this
has
been
said
before
in
the
court's
opinions.
i
think
justice
burton
said
it
as
sharply
as
anyone
in
his
first
iowa
opinion
which
we've
quoted
in
the
--
which
i'd
like
to
quote
one
sentence
from.
we've
set
it
out
20
--
page
21
of
our
brief.
he
speaks
of
the
water
power
act
as
the
outgrowth
of
a
widely
supported
effort
of
the
conservationists
to
secure
enactment
of
a
complete
scheme
of
national
regulation
which
would
promote
the
comprehensive
development
of
the
water
resources
of
the
nation
insofar
as
it
was
within
the
reach
of
the
federal
power
to
do
so.
now,
i'm
not
suggesting,
arching
back
to
the
question
mr.
justice
harlan
raised
earlier
that
congress
in
1920
conceived
the
projects
like
the
present
one
and
consciously
decided
to
cover
them.
i
am
not
saying
that
congress
in
that
year
conceived
of
the
commerce
power
as
we
think
of
it
today.
surely,
it
did
not.
only
two
years
earlier
in
1918
this
court
had
held
the
federal
child
labor
act
unconstitutional
in
hammer
against
dagenhart
principally
on
the
theory
that
manufacturing
in
commerce
were
wholly
separable
concepts
and
that
commerce
in
essence
meant
no
more
than
transportation.
and
we
acknowledge
that
numerous
members
of
the
congress
which
passed
the
water
power
act
tended
to
equate
commerce
and
navigation.
our
point
however
is
that
congress
did
not
attempt
to
define
commerce
here
by
any
words
of
limitation.
on
the
contrary
we
think
that
the
history
of
the
measures
which
culminated
in
this
act
show
that
congress
was
doing
everything
that
it
thought
itself
constitutionally
empowered
to
do
in
the
interest
of
controlling
the
water
resources
of
their
nation
--
of
the
nation
and
of
promoting
their
optimum
utilization.
in
other
words
this
is
not
a
situation
if
i
may
borrow
from
another
of
court's
opinions
in
which
congress
chose
to
freeze
the
operation
of
a
statute
within
the
mold
of
the
then
current
judicial
decisions
defining
the
commerce
power.
now
i've
spoken
of
the
statutes
broad
objectives
and
of
the
congressional
design
as
we
see
it
to
exhaust
the
commerce
power.
there
is
also
a
specific
history
of
section
23
(b)
which
supports
our
view,
a
predecessor
bill
similar
in
most
of
its
sections
have
been
before
congress
in
1919,
a
filibuster
in
which
senator
la
follette
figured
prominently
killed
that
bill
in
the
closing
hours
of
the
65th
congress.
in
this
predecessor
bill
the
provision
granting
the
commission
licensing
jurisdiction
over
a
project
on
a
non-navigable
stream
was
more
confining.
in
substance
the
commission
was
told
by
the
language
of
that
bill
to
determine
whether
the
project
would
affect
navigation
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
rather
than
the
interests
of
congress.
i
am
not
arguing
that
this
particular
provision
was
the
cause
of
the
filibuster.
senator
lafollete's
primary
objection
is
deterrent
rested
on
quite
another
point
what
he
regarded
in
the
1919
bill
as
an
unduly
def
--
unduly
narrow
definition
of
navigable
waters.
he
feared
that
the
definition
of
navigable
waters
in
that
bill
would
not
include
shoals
or
waterfalls
which
of
course
are
a
particular
importance
from
the
power
standpoint.
to
continue
with
our
story
of
the
history
in
the
next
session
of
congress
the
provision
which
is
now
section
23
(b)
came
out
of
the
house
in
precisely
the
same
form
as
it
had
taken
in
the
1919
bill
that
is
to
say,
jurisdiction
under
non-navigable
rivers
turned
upon
a
finding
that
navigation
will
be
affected.
it
was
changed.
it
was
changed
by
the
senate
committee
which
eliminated
the
reference
to
navigation
and
substituting
in
its
place
the
words,
the
interests
of
interstate
and
far
--
or
foreign
commerce.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
was
in
1920,
the
senate
committee
and
if
the
senate
committees
do
prevailed
at
conference
and
the
bill
took
the
form
that
you
now
see
it.
now,
there
is
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
precisely.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
it's
a
question
of
making
the
finding
which
would
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
commission
has
plenary
authority
over
a
navig
--
over
a
non-navigable
stream.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i'm
suggesting
that
when
the
commission
finds
that
commerce
will
be
affected
by
the
project
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
on
the
nav
--
non-navigable
stream
that
it
has
jurisdiction
and
that
this
affect
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i'm
saying
this
effect
maybe
shown
alternatively
either
by
showing
an
effect
upon
commerce
on
the
river
or
an
effect
on
commerce
in
the
transmission
of
energy,
interstate
commerce.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
don't
think
they
do.
they
wanted
a
determination
as
to
the
commission's
jurisdiction
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
the
sole
argument
i
think
is
whether
the
effect
on
commerce
means
effect
on
commerce
on
the
river
as
you
need
electric
arches
and
as
we
would
have
been
bound
to
concede
if
the
1919
act
have
passed
and
has
been
formed
or
whether
commerce
is
used
in
the
statute
maybe
taken
as
it
is
in
the
labor
act
and
then
the
sherman
act
and
in
other
federal
regulatory
statutes
do
include
the
showing
of
interstate
commerce
whether
on
the
river
or
whether
on
dry
land.
now
that's
what
the
dispute
i
think
comes
down
to.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
it
was
on
a
stream
and
(a)
the
project
did
not
affect
any
downstream
navigable
capacity
and
(b)
the
electricity
there
generated
was
used
intrastate.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
interstate?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
any
project
on
a
stream
where
the
energy
developed
at
that
project
is
transmitted
interstate
i
think
would
be
within
the
reach
of
the
commission's
licensing
authority.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i'm
--
we're
dealing
here
with
a
tributary
of
a
navigable
river.
we're
not
dealing
with
a
salt
lake
or
some
body
of
water
which
doesn't
connect
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
with
the
nation's
river
system.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
certainly
the
last
sentence
of
section
23
(b)
which
i
spoke
of
earlier
shows
that
congress
thought
it
had
some
elements
of
jurisdiction
at
least
overall
the
tributaries
of
navigable
streams.
now,
i'm
not
talking
about
ponds
or
a
body
of
water
which
is
not
part
of
the
nation's
river
system.
certainly
that
is
not
our
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
i
think
as
a
matter
--
the
constitutional
matter
certainly,
congress
can
read
any
generation
where
there's
an
effect
on
commerce.
whether
the
congress
thought
about
possibility
in
terms
of
a
pond
or
some
body
of
water
which
wasn't
part
of
the
nation's
river
system,
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
at
the
moment
but
it
is
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
at
least
clear
that
congress
thought
that
it
could
regulate
--
that
it
could
treat
it
within
its
jurisdiction
the
tributaries
which
were
part
of
the
entire
watershed
of
a
navigable
stream.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
was
in
both
the
1919
and
in
the
1920
bills
certainly.
the
change
that
i
just
been
adverting
to,
the
change
from
affecting
navigation
to
affecting
the
interest
of
commerce
came
in
1920.
now
i
should
in
candor
add
that
the
committee
reports
do
not
explain
why
the
senate
made
that
change.
the
fact
is
that
it
was
made
and
i
think
the
presumption
is
that
it
was
not
inadvertent.
we
urge
for
this
and
other
reasons
that
unexpressed
limitations
limiting
the
commerce
power
to
commerce
on
the
river
are
not
to
be
read
in
now.
the
second
question
in
this
case
and
i
shall
deal
very
briefly
with
it
turns
much
more
on
the
particular
facts.
we
acknowledged
in
our
petition
that
standing
alone
that
issue
would
not
warrant
certiorari.
we
nevertheless
reserved
the
question
as
an
alternative
ground
for
reversal.
stating
it
in
our
petition
in
these
words
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
warranted
in
rejecting
the
commissions
finding
that
the
project
would
affect
the
navigable
capacity
of
the
black
river
and
on
that
independent
ground
was
required
to
be
licensed.
both
the
examiner
and
the
commission
concluded
on
the
basis
of
stipulated
facts
that
under
usual
and
ordinary
conditions,
the
operation
of
the
taum
sauk
project
would
not
affect
the
navigable
capacity
of
the
black.
however,
the
examiner
found
after
detailed
analysis
with
which
the
commission
agreed
that
when
there
was
a
concurrence
of
certain
conditions
the
project
was
capable
of
having
a
measurable
and
a
pronounced
effect
upon
downstream
navigability.
now,
we
take
it
as
clear
from
the
cases
that
the
commission
need
not
find
in
order
to
conclude
that
the
interests
of
navigation
would
be
affected.
that
the
effect
will
be
continuous
or
that
it
will
be
inevitable.
i
don't
suggest
of
course
that
it
would
suffice
for
us
to
postulate
conditions
which
border
on
defense.
now
our
first
assumption
is
that
on
occasion
there
will
be
periods
of
extremely
high
flow
or
a
flood
when
the
sluices
in
the
dam
will
not
be
able
to
pass
all
of
the
water
through
as
rapidly
as
it
accumulates
from
upstream.
the
examiner
pointed
out
that
this
had
happen
on
a
number
of
past
occasions,
as
i
recall
there
had
been
floods
in
1949
and
in
1950.
when
during
such
a
period
of
high
flow
or
flood
a
generating
cycle
has
begun
in
order
to
meet
system
needs
thus
adding
to
the
water
in
the
already
swollen
lower
pool,
the
full
impact
of
the
water
stored
up
there
upon
the
mountain
top,
the
stages
of
the
black
river,
the
examiner
concluded
will
be
appreciably
rage
downstream.
also
during
a
period
of
high
flow
there
might
be
a
malfunction
or
improper
operation
of
some
of
the
facilities.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
about
2
years
ago.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
a
year
and
a
half
from

mr.

(inaudible)
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh,
no.
i'm
sorry.
i
said
there
had
been
floods.
the
examiner
studied
the
history
of
the
stream
and
he
said
that
we've
had
occasions
in
the
past
where
there
has
been
flood.
now,
we
know
if
the
water
will
be
flowing
at
a
certain
amount
--
at
a
certain
number
of
feet
per
second
the
sluices
won't
be
able
to
handle
it.
if
that
have
--
happens,
the
elevation
in
the
lower
pool
will
rise.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
then
if
at
the
same
time
a
--
an
outage
occurs
somewhere
else
on
the
system
and
taum
sauk
project
is
pulled
in
to
pick
up
the
load
and
the
generating
cycle
begins
then
you'll
have
this
added
accretion.
and
similarly
he
showed
that
if
you
had
periods
of
high
flow
and
there
were
certain
types
of
malfunction
you
would
get
the
same
result.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
record
does
not
show
and
we
don't
have
any
information
really
as
to
how
the
operation
has
been
going
on.
the
company's
project
will
be
subject
to
commission's
inspection
and
safety
requirements
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
is
licensable
but
not
otherwise.
the
finding
as
to
the
effect
of
malfunction
in
these
periods
of
high
flow
i
will
take
time
to
detail
it
but
it's
set
out
in
some
detail
at
record
93
by
the
examiner.
now
it's
perfectly
cruel
that
when
an
effect
upon
navigability
depends
as
it
does
here
upon
a
concurrence
of
various
conditions,
the
chances
of
it's
taking
place
are
substantially
diminished
as
any
--
patron
of
the
racetrack
i
suppose
knows
it's
easier
to
pick
one
winner
than
to
pick
the
daily
double
or
the
twin
double
or
in
here,
one
needs
a
concurrence
of
various
conditions.
the
fact
is
however
that
this
project
is
a
patron
as
it
were
of
the
laws
of
chance
day
in
and
day
out.
it
goes
to
the
well
everyday.
and
i
think
no
one
can
say
with
complete
assurance
that
the
events
to
which
i
have
referred
will
not
take
place
tomorrow
or
the
day
after.
i
think
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
does
not
demonstrate
that
these
conclusions
of
the
commission
are
in
error.
rather
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
say
but
this
isn't
really
very
likely
and
then
the
court
adds
this
thought
which
i
think
is
the
key
to
its
opinion.
it
appears
at
record
297.
if
in
the
operation
of
the
project
it
later
develops
at
any
time
in
the
future
that
the
navigability
of
the
black
river
is
impaired
or
threatened
to
be
impaired
the
commission
would
have
authority
under
section
4
(g)
to
issue
an
appropriate
order
including
an
order
to
prevent
further
operation
of
the
project
without
a
license.
our
answer
to
that
is
that
licensing
is
essentially
a
preventive
device.
as
your
honors
know
that
the
license
is
required.
the
commission
may
write
conditions
into
the
license
to
assure
that
the
works
are
constructed,
operated
and
maintained
in
a
way
which
will
provide
maximum
safeguards.
it
may
implement
those
conditions
through
its
powers
of
investigation
as
it
does
under
its
dam
inspection
program.
in
short,
we
think
the
institutions
of
these
procedures
ought
not
await
the
occurrence
of
untoward
consequences.
if
we
read
the
licensing
scheme
rightly
the
commission
is
entitled
to
be
forehanded.
thank
you.
