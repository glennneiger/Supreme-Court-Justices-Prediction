mr.
robert
j.
keefe
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
initially
i
would
like
to
comment
very
briefly
upon
a
few
of
the
factors
that
were
mentioned
in
the
argument
by
the
assistant
solicitor
general.
there
are
two
points
argued
in
there
in
the
brief
for
the
commission,
the
first
one
being
--
one
relating
to
the
construction
of
the
statute
which
is
the
ground
upon
which
certiorari
was
sought
and
obtained
in
this
court
and
the
second
being
the
question
of
whether
the
court
below
erred
in
rejecting
the
commission's
conclusion
that
this
project
would
substantially
effect
--
affect
downstream
navigability.
we
think
the
second
question
is
not
properly
before
the
court
recognizing
of
course
that
that's
the
matter
for
the
court's
discretion
but
we
have
pointed
out
for
pertinent
facts
as
to
why
we
think
is
not
here
and
what
the
nature
of
the
question
presented
is
which
without
going
into
the
detail,
is
a
factual
question
along
the
first
of
the
two
phases
of
the
case
to
which
the
brief
of
the
--
or
the
commission
is
largely
devoted.
i
have
--
submit
these
few
comments
on
what
was
stated
in
the
beginning
of
the
argument
in
opposition
of
--
before
the
commission.
first,
this
is
not
a
statute
which
provides
or
lays
as
a
test
whether
or
not
the
project
will
affect
interstate
commerce.
now,
that's
a
vital
point.
throughout
their
brief
we
have
assumed
that
although
at
places
they
recognized
that
the
language
is
somewhat
different.
what
they
treated
just
as
any
other
case,
your
honor
mentioned
the
--
mr.
justice
goldberg,
the
labor
act
case,
they
rely
--
labor
act
--
they
rely
on
the
cases
under
that
act
which
of
course
does
constituted
and
exercised
by
the
congress
of
its
broad
power
over
interstate
commerce.
and
their
old
theory
and
the
cases
upon
which
they
rely
are
based
upon
the
essential
premise
that
in
this
statute
congress
exercised
its
power
over
interstate
commerce
generally.
i
am
happy
that
it's
stated
that
way
because
that's
a
precise
issue
and
the
one
to
which
we
wished
to
direct
our
argument
as
we
have
directedour
brief.
this
is
a
water
power
act
and
water
power
is
not
only
power
but
water.
and
what
the
congress
was
dealing
with
here
was
affect
on
waters.
and
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
harlan
who
suggested
the
question
what
is
the
jurisdiction
of
congress
over
non-navigable
tributaries
of
navigable
streams
and
that
is
a
vital
question
to
which
we
have
devoted
an
important
part
of
our
brief.
one
other
comment
that
i
have
wished
to
make
as
a
preliminary
matter
is
that
although
this
act
was
passed
through
--
in
1920,
federal
water
power
act.
the
vital
provisions
in
the
section
with
which
we're
concerned,
well,
i
won't
say
all
of
the
vital
provisions
but
some
of
the
most
vital
provisions
were
not
put
in
to
the
act
until
1935.
it
was
then
that
it
was
made
mandatory
rather
than
discretionary
for
a
company
before
constructing
a
project
in
a
non-navigable
tributary
to
file
a
declaration
of
intention
with
the
commission.
before
that
it
had
been
discretionary,
a
company
might
do
it
for
its
own
protection
and
obtain
the
commission
determination.
but
in
1935
that
was
made
mandatory.
in
that
year
also
--
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
or
--
the
statute
is
plain
your
honor.
in
any
stream
over
which
congress
has
jurisdiction
under
its
power
to
regulate
commerce
with
foreign
nations
are
among
the
several
states.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
it
certainly
is.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
absolutely.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
no,
that
--
it
may
or
may
not
affect
navigable
capacity
downstream
which
we
think
is
the
tests.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
yes
sir.
any
--
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
no,
this
undoubtedly
as
congress
has
jurisdiction
over
every
non-navigable
tributary
of
a
navigable
water.
the
statute
says
over
waters
which
are
not
navigable
and
over
which
congress
has
jurisdiction
under
its
power
to
regulate
commerce.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
yes
it
has
your
honor.
the
jurisdiction
--
jurisdiction
is
a
general
term.
now,
one
of
the
points
i
want
to
get
at
and
an
important
one
and
i
think
one
that
was
suggested
from
the
bench
earlier
is,
what
is
that
jurisdiction
of
congress
over
a
non-navigable
tributary?
is
it
plenary?
they
have
a
right
to
prohibit
any
use
of
the
water
or
is
it
a
jurisdiction
that's
related
to
the
use
of
navigable
waters
downstream
and
we
think
and
the
historic
interpretation
of
the
act
has
been
that
it's
the
latter.
congress
under
the
commerce
power,
i'm
a
little
out
of
my
orders
in
making
the
comment
but
it's
as
well
here
as
any
place
of
the
commerce
power
of
course
is
the
power
to
regulate
commerce.
and
in
early
cases
way
back
in
gibbon
(inaudible)
--
gibbon
versus
ogden,
it
was
pointed
out
that
that
part
regulated
commerce
implies
the
power
to
regulate
the
media
of
commerce
among
which
are
navigable
waters,
navigable
waters.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
oh,
i
think
--
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
the
interstate
feature
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
in
our
opinion.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
i
have
--
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
oh,
i
would
not
--
well,
i
am
--
under
its
general
commerce
power,
your
honor,
it
may.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
yes,
i
have
admitted
in
the
brief.
if
congress
--
undoubtedly
a
generating
plant
affects
interstate
commerce,
if
that's
all
that's
involved
here
why
--
there's
no
lawsuit.
we
admit
that.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
that's
right.
that's
my
understanding,
a
non-navigable
stream.
now,
in
a
navigable
stream
congress
has
in
effect
made
a
legislative
finding
that
you
can't
create
any
obstruction
in
a
navigable
stream
regardless
of
what
the
purpose
of
it
is.
but
on
these
non-navigable
streams,
congress
has
said
if
the
project
will
affect
the
interests,
not
affect
the
interstate
commerce
but
the
interest
of
interstate
commerce
then
it
can't
be
constructed
on
the
non-navigable
tributary
without
a
license.
now,
that
word
interest
is
another
word
which
has
been
left
out
of
account
that
i
mentioned
there
before,
it's
a
word
i
mentioned
before.
that
word
as
we
think
under
general
rules
of
construction
must
be
related
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
act
and
particularly
to
the
context.
now,
if
i
may
get
to
my
points.
i'm
glad
to
have
the
questions
however
but
a
little
--
they
anticipate
some
of
the
points
but
there
is
--
well
one
place
as
in
other.
we
have
this
statute
poses
for
the
commission
to
decide
the
question
of
whether
construction
in
a
non-navigable
--
in
a
stream
of
a
defined
class
will
have
an
effect
on
interests
such
as
those
referred
to
in
the
statute.
now
what
is
a
steam
--
stream
of
a
defined
class
and
what
are
interests.
those
are
the
questions
i
think
that
we're
concerned
with
primarily.
a
stream
of
a
defined
class
as
i've
already
said
is
a
stream
over
which
congress
--
a
tributary
of
a
navigable
water
over
which
congress
has
jurisdiction,
under
its
power
to
regulate
interstate
and
foreign
commerce.
interests,
what
are
the
interests
of
commerce?
well,
the
interest
in
non-related
fields
that
the
statute
refers
to
are
the
interest
relating
to
this
water
about
which
congress
was
legislating
and
exercising
its
jurisdiction.
now,
the
first
point
we
have
into
the
brief
is
1
(a),
that
word
--
the
jurisdiction
of
con
--
jurisdiction
of
the
streams
over
which
congress
has
jurisdiction
under
his
power
to
regulate
commerce.
the
commission
decision
goes
into
that
in
great
extent
but
only
to
demonstrate
that
congresshas
jurisdiction,
had
jurisdiction,
of
course
it
have.
that's
obvious.
no
demonstration
was
needed.
this
is
a
tributary
of
a
navigable
water
and
therefore
congress
has
jurisdiction.
but,
the
important
question
which
the
commission
did
not
go
into
and
which
the
brief
of
counsel
for
the
commission
does
not
deal
with
it
as
i
read
it
is,
what
is
that
jurisdiction?
what
is
the
nature
of
it?
what
is
the
extent
of
it?
what's
the
purpose
of
it?
that
jurisdiction
we
see
on
the
authority
of
uniformed
decisions
in
this
court,
that
is
the
jurisdiction
to
take
appropriate
measures
or
to
take
measures
which
in
the
judgment
of
congress
are
appropriate
to
protect,
that
is
measures
with
reference
to
a
non-navigable
tributary
to
take
measures
with
reference
to
that
stream
or
the
protection
or
improvement
of
navigable
water
into
which
the
stream
flows.
that's
our
point.
and
that's
the
point
that's
decisive
--
well,
it's
not
self-decisive
but
it's
a
principal
factor
because
that
term
is
used
in
the
statute.
it's
part
of
a
subject
matter
of
the
statute.
it's
an
essential
part
of
the
subject
matter
and
it's
a
thing
that
must
be
determined
before
we
know
what
the
statute
means.
now,
i'm
not
--
i've
stated
the
proposition,
it
goes
back,
i
--
if
i
may
divert
for
a
moment,
there's
some
comment
here
and
there
about
the
evolving
commer--
evolving
concepts
of
the
commerce
power.
well,
there
is
no
evolving
common
concept
of
the
commerce
power
in
this
case
at
least
and
i
think
incidentally
in
many
others
too.
but
here
this
concept
of
the
commerce
power
was
decided,
there
was
--
perfectly
delineated
in
1899
--
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
--
in
the
case
which
is
often
been
cited
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
since
of
united
states
against
rio
grande.
i
have
trouble
with
that
word,
i'm
trying
to
say
rio
grande
but
i
understand
its
rio
grande
dam
and
irrigation
company.
that
was
the
case
in
which
the
government
attempted
and
did
ultimately
--
well,
it
attempted
to
enjoin
the
construction
of
a
project
dam
over
a
non-navigable
river
in
the
territory
of
new
mexico.
i
say
a
non-navigable
river
because
the
rio
grande
which
is
navigable
downstream
but
at
that
point
was
found
by
the
district
court
to
be
non-navigable.
and
the
court
in
1899
went
into
that
thoroughly.
what
was
the
jurisdiction
of
congress
over
the
non-navigable
part
of
the
stream,
the
head
waters
and
laid
down
the
very
parts
upon
which
we're
rely
here
and
upon
which
your
honors
have
relied
and
which
your
honors
have
applied
in
subsequent
cases.
they
said
--
i
don't
want
to
burden
the
court
by
reading
but
here
--
ordinarily,
but
here
is
some
language
on
the
rio
grande
case
which
i
think
is
important.
in
other
words
the
jurisdiction
of
the
general
government
over
interstate
commerce
and
it's
natural
highways
vest
in
that
government
the
right
to
take
all
needed
measures
to
preserve
the
navigability
of
the
navigable
water
courses
of
the
country,
even
against
state
action.
and
further
on
it
said
it
was
construing
there
the
--
a
section
of
the
river
and
harbor
act
of
1890
that
this
--
there
was
a
later
one
of
1899,
this
was
1890,
which
prohibited
obstructions
in
streams.
and
it
said,
it
would
be
to
improperly
ignore
the
scope
of
this
language.
that
is
the
language
of
a
statute
to
limited
--
to
acts
done
within
the
very
limits
of
navigable
--
of
navigation
of
a
navigable
stream.
in
other
words,
the
head
waters
are
controllable
--
reg
--
and
maybe
regulated
in
use
of
--
they
maybe
regulated
by
congress
but
always
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
or
improving
the
navigability
of
waters
downstream
over
which
congress
has
jurisdiction
because
they're
highways
of
commrce.
we've
cited
other
cases.
there
is
an
important
case,
state
of
oklahoma
and
maxwell
phillips,
the
governor
of
that
state
against
guy
f.
atkinson
in
which
that
--
the
exact
principle
was
applied
and
reaffirmed
and
the
rio
grande
case
was
cited
as
the
primary
authority.
the
opinion
was
written
by
mr.
justice
douglas
and
it
went
in
thoroughly
to
the
nature
of
the
jurisdiction
of
congress
to
the
effect
that
i
have
stated.
there
have
been
other
cases.
we've
cited
some
--
a
few
united
states
versus
grand
river
dam
authority
decided
in
1960.
all
of
them
without
any
suggestion
of
any
evolving
concept
of
the
commerce
power
and
it
changed
in
it
--
applying
the
very
principle
that
was
enunciated
in
1899
and
prior
to
that
even
in
other
cases.
now
they
are
--
they
make
up
the
counsel
for
the
commission
make
a
great
point
of
other
purposes
and
motives
by
the
conservationist
who
were
interested
in
--
passage
of
the
water
power
legislation.
and
they
are
correct.
they
did
have
a
lot
of
other
motives
and
purposes
by
many
of
them.
those
motives
and
purposes
are
immaterial
under
clear
decisions
of
this
court.
once
you
have
a
constitutional
objective
as
here
to
protect
or
improve
navigability
of
streams
which
are
highway
of
--
highways
of
commerce
then
the
fact
that
they're
--
that
congress
--
that
the
proponents
of
the
legislation
or
the
congressmen
who
voted
for
it
may
have
had
other
motives.
they
may
have
wanted
to
develop
electric
power
and
may
have
wanted
to
provide
water
for
irrigation.
it
may
have
wanted
to
provide
recreational
areas.
none
of
those
is
a
constitutional
objective.
they
couldn't
do
that
if
that
were
the
only
objective
of
the
legislation.
but
if
the
legislation
is
first
reasonably
adapted
to
the
protection
or
improvement
of
navigability
then
the
other
purposes
maybe
added
to
it
and
that
has
been
pointed
out
expressly.
i
think
it
was
very
clearly
stated
by
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
arizona
against
california
as
i
recall
and
it's
been
recently
pointed
out
to
him
the
oklahoma
case
that
i
mentioned
where
there
was
a
so-called
multiple
purpose
project
providing
water
for
irrigation
and
recreation
and
generation
of
power
and
perhaps
other
things.
the
constitutional
purpose
and
the
thing
that
made
the
statute
valid
is
within
the
power
of
congress
was
that
it
would
improve
or
protect
the
navigability
of
the
red
river
downstream
from
the
non-navigable
part
of
it
in
which
the
project
was
constructed
and
of
the
mississippi
river
into
which
that
stream
flowed.
we
have
dealt
with
that
in
some
detail
in
the
brief
and
i
think
i'm
leaving
--
go
into
--
in
detail
all
in
here
unless
there
is
a
question
about
it.
now,
there
are
two
cases
i'd
like
to
mention
in
that
connection
at
which
you
relied
on
by
counsel
for
the
commission.
one
is
the
appalachian
case,
so-called,
that's
united
states
against
appalachian
power
company
in
which
the
government
sought
to
enjoin
and
did
enjoin
the
construction
of
a
project
without
a
license.
there
were
some
language
written
in
--
the
language
in
that
opinion
which
was
written
by
mr.
justice
reed,
we
--
upon
which
they
rely
and
which
may
superficially
seem
to
depart
somewhat
from
the
doctrine
enunciated
in
the
rio
grande
cases
and
others
but
he
--
in
fact
does
not.
and
he
--
the
--
what
i
referred
to
is
this,
i
may
have
quoted
it
and
if
i
may
impose
your
honors
i
can
do
it
more
briefly
than
by
describing
it.
the
court
said,
"in
our
view,
it
cannot
properly
be
said
that
the
constitutional
power
of
congress
over
its
waters
is
limited
to
control
for
navigation".
oh,
that
much
looks
against
beyond
the
--
on
the
face
of
it
but
notice
the
rest
of
it.
by
navigation
respondent
means
no
more
than
operation
of
boats
and
improvement
of
the
waterway
itself.
in
truth,
the
authority
of
the
united
states
is
the
regulation
of
commerce
on
it's
waters
and
it
goes
on
navigability
in
the
sense
you
just
stated
that
is
by
the
respondent,
limited
and
"in
the
improvement
of
the
navigable
portion
is
but
a
part
of
this
whole
flood
protection,
watershed
development,
recovery
of
the
cost
of
improvements
through
utilization
of
power
or
likewise
parts
of
commerce
controlling".
now,
when
that
is
read,
there
is
not
anything
in
that
that's
contrary
to
what
i
have
said.the
flood
control
as
pointed
out
in
the
oklahoma
case
of
course,
if
floods
are
uncontrolled
they'll
impair
navigation
where
navigation
is
possible.
and
so
you
may
control
floods,
congress
may,
not
only
on
the
navigable
water
but
on
the
headwaters
or
up
to
the
top
of
the
headwaters
to
prevent
the
sources
of
floods
and
watershed
development
falls
in
the
same
category
as
pointed
out
in
the
oklahoma
case
and
in
of
it.
of
this
power
production
recovery
of
the
cost,
of
improvements
through
utilization
of
power,
that
is
your
honors
will
note
--
perhaps
recall
in
the
case
of
ashwander
against
tennessee
valley
authority
where
that
was
a
principal
issue.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
the
--
that
was
put
upon
the
ground
that
the
government.
that
was
in
a
navigable
stream,
a
government
building,
a
dam
in
a
navigable
stream.
it
became
a
proprietor
of
the
water
power,
potential
water
power
that
was
made
available
and
the
court
said
it
needn't
waste
it,
it
may
use
it.
i
don't
think
that
limits
it.
i
don't
think
it's
limited
to
that
precise
concept
that
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
government
has
a
right
to
provide
for
generation
of
power
or
other
reasons
or
motives
than
merely
that
of
not
wasting
the
water
power.
but
the
point
about
it
is
that
it
must
first
have
a
constitutional
purpose
which
is
the
improvement
or
preservation
of
navigability
and
that
--
unless
that's
(inaudible),
none
of
the
other
things
may
be
done.
that's
the
appalachian
case.
the
other
case
upon
which
they
principally
rely,
and
it
is
mentioned
here
in
argument
is
the
first
iowa
case
and
there's
some
language
in
that
that
stresses
the
objectives
of
the
conservationists
or
when
that
case
is
read
i'm
not
going
to
--
i
know
your
honors
provide
any
more
reading
from
that
but
they
are
on
me.
when
that
case
is
read,
it
will
be
found
that
what
the
court
is
dealing
with
there
was
it
contention
by
the
state
of
iowa
that
there
must
--
be
affirmed,
that
was
for
a
project,
i
should
have
said,
a
project
was
proposed
to
be
constructed
on
a
river
in
iowa
which
was
navigable.
i
think
the
--
cedar
river
and
would
affect
another
river,
the
iowa
river
both
of
which
were
navigable
streams.
the
proposed
constructor
or
the
company
proposing
they
construct
the
project
applied
with
the
commission,
the
federal
power
commission
for
a
license,
contention
was
made
that
you
--
they
first
had
to
get
a
permit
from
iowa
under
the
iowa
law.
and
that
contention
was
made
in
reliance
so
--
in
section
9
of
the
federal
power
act
which
requires
compliance
with
state
laws.
so
the
federal
power
commission
denied
the
license
solely
in
order
to
enable
the
--
to
permit
the
case
to
be
brought
before
this
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
stae
of
--
a
permit
from
the
state
of
iowa
would
be
required
as
a
condition
of
constructing
the
(inaudible)
--
of
obtaining
the
federal
power
commission
license.
and
in
that
connection
dealing
with
that
contention
the
court
pointed
out
that
that
would
be
all
to
give
it
con
--
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
with
the
objectives
of
it
which
was
national
control
over
the
water
system
of
a
country
that
affected
navigable
waters.
and
that's
i
think
the
essence
of
what's
involved
in
that
case
and
what
they
quote
from
it
does
not
in
any
ways
affect
the
primary
fundamental
proposition
that
the
jurisdiction
of
congress
over
a
non-navigable
tributary
is
the
jurisdiction
to
protect
or
improve
downstream
navigable
waters.
now,
that's
a
fundamental
point
and
the
section
of
the
statute,
section
23
must
be
read
to
the
--
question
the
crucial
provisions
in
which
we're
interested
of
course
must
be
read
with
all
of
the
context
but
that
one
--
that
element
among
others
--
and
fundamentally
that
element.
of
the
second
point
i
have
to
make
is
largely
related
to
that
and
i
may
deal
with
it
more
briefly
and
that
is
the
proposition
that
the
other
terms
in
the
section
23
confirm
that
the
idea
that
this
was
intended.
the
interest
of
interstate
commerce
referred
to
in
the
section
are
those
related
to
commerce
on
the
waters,
downstream
navigable
waters.
i
shan't
devote
very
much
attention
to
that
and
it's
a
matter
that
appeals
rather
to
the
--
to
the
eye
then
to
the
ear
of
--
when
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute
with
these
terms
--
the
specific
terms
related
to
their
immediate
context,
the
point
appears
clear
as
--
at
least
it
does
to
me.
we've
cited
out
at
page
45
of
our
brief,
any
person,
association
or
state
or
municipality
and
so
on
intending
to
construct
a
dam
or
other
project
works.
now,
project
works
as
defined
as
physical
structures
of
a
project.
construct
of
dam
or
other
project
works
along,
over,
across,
along,
over
or
in
any
stream
over
which
congress
has
jurisdiction
under
its
commerce
power
shall
file
a
declaration
of
intent
with
the
commission.
and
if
the
commission
determines
that
the
proposed
construction
will
affect
the
interests
of
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
then
the
construction
may
not
be
carried
on
without
a
license.
now
there
are
a
number
of
significant
terms
there.
the
word
construction
of
itself
is
an
important
one.
i
don't
want
to
claim
too
much
for
that
term
but
i
think
it
certainly
implies
at
least
this
much
that
what
congress
was
driving
against
there
was
structure
so
placed
as
to
affect
those
waters,
construction
of
a
dam
or
other
physical
structures
across,
along,
over
or
in
a
stream.
obviously,
the
purpose
of
that
is
to
deal
with
what
might
affect
that
stream
and
thereby
in
turn
affect
downstream
navigable
waters.
at
least
the
language
is
perfectly
consistent
with
that
intent
and
it
would
seem
by
the
same
token
would
be
inept
if
what
they
were
intending
to
do
was
to
prohibit
interstate
transmission
of
electricity
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
use
--
well,
i
won't
say,
nothing
to
do
with
the
use
of
the
waters.
they
use
water
to
generate
power
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
downstream
navigability
and
that's
their
point
here.
they
say
that
this
independently
of
any
effect
on
downstream
navigability
if
you
intend
to
transmit
energy
from
your
plant
in
interstate
commerce
that
it's
within
the
jurisdiction
of
congress
and
under
this
act.
so
i
have
--
i've
--
we've
dealt
with
that
in
the
brief
and
it's
a
matter
of
detail
and
i
think
i
need
not
dwell
upon
it
any
further
but
there
are
two
things
that
i
want
to
mention.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
offhand,
i
don't
see
that
it
would
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
it
would
not.
i
think
the
sole
test
of
the
requirement
for
a
license
here
in
a
non-navigable
water
is
what's
indicated
by
the
jurisdiction
to
congress.
that
is
to
protect
downstream
navigable
waters
or
to
improvement
them.
and
if
the
project
would
affect
those
waters
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
you
do
with
the
power
generated
whether
you
generate
it
to
--
for
local
distribution
or
for
interstate
transmission.
that's
another
matter.
incidentally,
as
has
been
pointed
out
in
some
cases
here,
some
of
your
honors
will
remember
a
case
against
the
idaho
power
company,
its
been
pointed
forcibly
that
part
2
of
this
act
deals
with
transmission.
that's
where
congress
took
jurisdiction
over
transmission
of
electricity
and
incidentally
as
long
as
the
point
is
of
now,
in
that
section
it
said,
"however,
congress
shall
have
--
however,
the
commission
shall
have
no
jur
--
well,
first
the
commission
shall
have
jurisdiction
over
transmission
in
interstate
commerce
and
over
facilities
for
such
transmission
but
you'll
have
no
jurisdiction
over
generating
facilities
except
to
the
extent
specifically
provided
in
part
2
and
part
3.
oh,
i
don't
claim
that
that
provision
governs
this
question
here
because
this
is
under
part
1.
and
if
the
license
is
required
then
the
commission
automatically
gets
jurisdiction
under
the
license.
but
it
is
significant
to
me
as
an
evidence
of
its
policy
--
of
congress
that
they
were
not
intending
to
give
this
commission
jurisdiction
over
generating
facilities
generally.
i
repeat
it
doesn't
govern
the
question
here.
have
i
answered
your
honors
question
or
--
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
oh,
this
is
all.
that
may
be
of
--
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
they're
talking
about
projects
in
a
stream
other
than
a
navigable
stream.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
project.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
they're
talking
about
the
water.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
yes
your
honor.
i
think
that's
agreed
here
on
both
sides.
and
i
thought
your
honor
was
going
to
mention
the
point
which
i
was
about
to
overlook
and
i
might
have
overlooked
it.
this
has
not
been
on
--
for
that
question
although
its
--
that
question
didn't
reach
it.
in
1903rd
as
i
have
said,
this
section
23
is
not
the
same
section
that
was
passed
in
1920.
it
was
amended
in
1935
in
four
particulars,
in
fact
the
whole
act
was
radically
amended
in
1935
and
revised
and
then
supplemented
by
parts
2
and
3.
but
in
section
23,
one
of
the
things
that
they
did
which
is
of
--
i
think
of
more
than
ordinary
importance
and
in
fact,
i
think
of
great
importance,
is
they
put
in
to
this
section
23
a
provision
which
had
not
been
in
it
before
relating
to
navigable
waters.
now
they
first
said,
no
one
shall
(inaudible)
--
construct
any
project
in
the
navigable
water
without
a
license.
now
that
had
been
taken
from
the
old
river
and
harbors
act
of
19
--
1899.
so
the
fact
that
they
pushed
it
in
there
did
not
impose
a
new
substantive
requirement
of
law.
it
was
a
requirement
that
existed
under
another
statute
but
their
reason
for
putting
it
into
this
section
23
is
very
significant.
it
were
stated
in
both
the
house
and
the
senate
committee
reports
and
that
as
i
shall
point
out
in
a
minute
--
a
few
minutes
was
following
the
issuance
of
a
member
of
the
federal
power
commission
which
sponsored
the
1935
amendments.
it
was
in
both
the
reports
that
the
purpose
of
putting
that
provision
regarding
navigable
waters
in
this
section
was
so
that
all
provision
--
that
all
--
and
that
everything
--
every
project
which
might
affect
any
navigable
water
would
be
covered
by
section
23
if
i
have
made
that
clear.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
your
honor,
there
is
a
non-expressed
legislative
finding
that
any
obstruction
in
a
navigable
stream
may
have
an
effect.
that's
the
effect
of
it.
there's
no
effect
to
require
it
all.
you
can't
construct
any
project
in
a
navigable
water
without
a
license.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
well,
the
first
part
of
the
section
as
your
honor
will
notice
applies
only
to
navigable
waters.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
congress
might
prohibit
any
construction
in
the
navigable
stream.
that's
been
established
in
prior
decisions.
there
--
that's
a
matter
over
congress.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
well,
now
that's
a
question
--
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
not
--
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
well,
that's
an
interesting
question
your
honor
and
the
--
but
it's
not
governed
by
the
same
principle
as
to
the
navigable
stream.
there's
no
question
about
that.
that's
a
highway
of
commerce.
and
if
the
congress
may
think,
"well,
we
cant'
allow
any
obstruction
in
a
navigable
stream
preventing
the
free
flow
of
commerce
on
that
highway
without
a
license".
now
they've
--
that's
the
effect
of
what
they
have
done
and
that's
perfectly
within
the
constitutional
power
and
the
proper
constitutional
objective.
when
you
come
to
a
non-navigable
tributary
whether
congress
could
prohibit
any
construction
there
without
a
license
it
has
in
the
power,
but
perhaps
it
could
and
i
--
that's
a
--
was
a
second
--
what
i
call
the
second
part
of
it
--
the
question
is
difficult,
the
first
part
is
easy.
the
constitutional
purpose
or
objective
would
be
clear
enough
if
they
were
doing
it
to
be
certain
that
there'll
be
un
--
no
untoward
effect
on
downstream
navigability.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
could
it
--
not
under
the
statute
--
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
could
it
do
it
under
any
statute?
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
yes,
i
think
the
generation
of
electric
--
when
you
get
to
the
general
commerce
power
which
is
what
they're
--
my
opponents
are
relying
on,
undoubtedly
generation
of
power
although
it's
a
local
activity,
the
generation
itself
although
it's
a
split
second
until
the
power
generated
is
a
thousand
miles
away
or
a
million
for
that
matter.
nevertheless
the
generation
is
separable
and
is
a
local
function
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
with
what
generation
of
power
on
--
the
generation
of
power
is
an
activity
that
will
--
for
interstate
transmission;
if
you
intend
to
transmit
it
interstate,
the
generation
of
power
is
matter
that
will
affect
interstate
commerce
and
therefore
it
might
be
regulated
by
congress.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
yes,
it
would.
that
would
make
more
difference.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
exactly
your
honor,
in
fact
congress
not
only
did
not
exercise
it's
power
but
i
--
its
other
parts
and
factors
involved
showed
carefully
refrained
from
exercising
any
power
except
in
this
statute
and
except
it's
power
over
waters.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
(inaudible)
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
that's
right.
that's
the
question
to
be
--
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
oh,
no,
i'm
only
saying
that
congress
under
its
general
commerce
power
could
(inaudible)
--
regulate
generation
of
electricity.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
they
did
not
--
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
--
this
is
a
water
power
act
and
they
are
only
dealing
with
water
power.
and
what
effects
navigable
waters
and
that's'
the
point.
that's
what
the
statute
is
involved
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
well,
not
quite
your
honor,
along
the
river
if
the
river
is
navigable.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
or
if
the
government
is
right,
if
you're
going
to
make
the
test
interstate
transmission
--
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
that's
what
they're
saying
and
it's
a
--
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
none
whatever.
it's
in
--
another
anomaly.
in
my
opinion,
if
they
wanted
to
regulate
plants
to
generate
for
interstate
transmission
they
should
have
regulated
them
all.
in
fact
the
water
--
all
the
water
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
pardon?
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
well,
out
of
the
--
all
of
the
--
all
of
the
hydroelectric
plants
in
the
country
together
is
shown
by
one
of
these
reports
which
i
have
--
had
distributed
to
your
honors,
the
1962
reports,
all
of
the
hydroelectric
generation
in
the
country.
that
includes
the
huge
tva
plants
and
all
of
the
government
plants
produce
only
a
little
over
19%,
at
least
20
or
less
than
20%
of
the
total
amount
of
electric
power
produced
in
the
country.
steam
plants
produce
--
well,
steam
plants
fueled
by
coal
or
oil
or
gas
produce
the
other
80%.
yet
they
--
concededly,
those
plants
are
not
subject
to
any
license
requirement
merely
because
they
transmit
in
interstate
commerce.
that's
your
honor's
point
i
take
it
then.
when
we
--
we
have
made
that
point
in
the
brief.
now
--
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
well
this
is
a
little
--
this
is
of
--
it's
a
sizable
plant,
it
generates
350,000
--
has
a
capacity
of
350,000
--
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
that's
the
whole
a
standby
plan,
a
standby
plan
for
times
of
peak
demand
or
that's
what
it
is.
now,
i
want
to
call
the
attention
--
i
start
to
call
the
attention,
the
two
points
here
and
i
regret
the
one
thing.
i
want
to
say
here
that
i
read
--
i
haven't
complied
with
my
whole
duty
to
the
court
here
in
one
respect.
i
overlooked
something
that
should've
been
stated
in
the
brief
and
that's
important.
and
i'd
like
to
call
the
attention
to
it
now
because
--
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
it's
not
a
new
point.
what
it's
--
a
confirmation
to
the
point
i
made
about
the
extent
of
which
--
into
which
jurisdiction
is
exercised
by
congress
in
this
statute.
i
have
dealt
with
what
the
jurisdiction
of
congress
is.
now,
if
your
honors
look
at
the
--
this
also
is
a
matter
that
is
visually
impressive
rather
than
orally.
in
appendix
c
of
the
brief
of
the
commission,
they've
set
out
the
provisions
of
section
4
which
define
the
licensing
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
and
in
section
4
(e)
which
appears
at
page
40
of
their
appendix
a,
page
40
of
appendix
a,
here
is
the
--
the
commission
is
hereby
authorized
and
empowered
to
issue
licenses
to
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
so
on.
now,
this
probably
be
skipping
down
a
few
lines,
for
the
purpose
of
constructing,
operating
and
maintaining
dams,
water
conduits,
reservoirs
powerhouses,
transmission
lines
or
other
project
works.
here's
the
important
part,
necessary
or
convenient
for
the
development
and
improvement
of
navigation.
it
goes
on,
and
for
--
notice
the
word,
"and"
for
the
development
transmission
and
utilization
of
water
of
power
across,
along,
from
or
in
any
of
the
streams
or
other
bodies
of
water
over
which
congress
had
a
jurisdiction.
later
on
in
that
section
it's
--
in
the
second
proviso,
kind
of
near
at
the
top
of
page
41,
provided
further
that
no
license
affecting
the
navigable
capacity
of
any
navigable
waters
of
the
united
states
shall
be
issued
until
the
plants
have
been
approved
by
the
chief
of
engineers.
now
that
section
as
i
say
it
confirms
i
think
the
point
we
made
about
the
jurisdiction
of
congress
and
the
jurisdiction
it
exercised
in
this
act.
but
it
also
relates
to
a
jurisdiction
of
a
commission
and
i
have
no
excuse
and
i'm
sorry
to
say
for
having
the
omission
of
that
from
the
brief.
it
should
have
been
put
in
and
i
think
your
honors
will
want
to
consider
it.
in
the
same
connection,
i
say
we
have
no
excuse.
it
was
not
due
to
any
lack
of
industry.
but
it
was
one
of
those
things
where
you're
concentrating
on
a
number
of
points
and
here's
one
that
we
--
confirmatory
of
one
of
our
main
points
and
we
unfortunately
overlooked.
page
42,
they
set
out
the
provisions
of
section
10
upon
which
they
rely
on
some
respects.
and
that
section
deals
with
the
conditions
to
be
put
in
to
licenses.
when
the
commission
issues
a
license
it
shall
impose
conditions.
the
first
part
of
that
section
10
(a)
on
page
42
of
their
append
--
their
brief,
part
of
appendix
c,
the
first
condition
is
this,
if
the
project
adopted
including
the
maps,
plans
and
specification
shall
be
such
as
in
the
judgment
of
the
commission
will
be
and
this
is
the
important
part,
best
adapted
to
a
comprehensive
plan
for
improving
or
developing
a
waterway
or
waterways
for
the
use
or
benefit
of
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
and
it
goes
along
with
other
conditions
but
there's
a
man
-
at
the
end
of
the
second
--
last
condition
and
that
first
one
is
a
mandatory
condition.
and
similarly
in
section
c
on
paragraph
c
on
the
same
page
42,
of
the
line,
other
conditions
that
the
licensee
shall
maintain
the
project
works
in
a
condition
of
repair
adequate
for
the
purposes
of
navigation.
that
has
to
go
into
a
license
or
how
would
such
a
condition
go
into
a
license
here
on
a
non-navigable
tributary
concededly
so.
if
--
it
might
go
in
but
only
in
relation
to
downstream
waters
which
are
navigable
confirming
in
my
judgment
the
whole
basic
theory
of
our
position
about
it
and
the
position
followed
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
contrary
to
theirs.
i
want
to
come
to
another
important
point
unless
your
honors
have
another
question
about
that.
that's
the
history
of
this
act
which
we
rely
on
and
i
think
if
there
are
any
use,
the
vernacular
clincher
needed
for
these
points
i
have
been
making
there
in
the
history
of
the
act.
i
don't
know
about
the
act,
of
the
proposed
act
of
1919
which
never
passed.
i
do
know
about
the
act
of
1920
which
did
pass
and
the
--
submitted
in
the
commission's
brief.
they
have
cited
some
instances
in
which
as
the
they
say
individual
congressmen
expressed
the
view
that
congress
had
no
power
except
essentially
the
power
i've
been
trying
to
delineate
here,
the
power
to
protect
navigable
capacity
or
to
improve
it.
but
what
is
important
here
are
not
those
expressions
of
--
by
individual
congressmen
although
they're
of
some
importance
but
the
assurance
is
given
by
the
sponsors
of
the
bill.
and
we
have
set
out
in
appendix
a
of
our
brief
which
is
back
at
page
--
ends
at
--
appendix
b
rather
of
our
brief
beginning
at
page
87,
we
attempted
to
make
this
easy
to
find
by
running
heads
and
caption,
appendix
b
begins
at
page
87.
and
there
--
well,
i've
quoted
from
it
that
the
--
in
an
earlier
part
of
the
brief
in
page
49.
there
senator
nelson
who
is
one
of
the
proponents
of
the
bill
and
entirely
in
charge
of
it
in
the
senate
or
one
of
them
was
in
charge
of
it.
i
judge
from
the
debates
and
he
was
a
member
of
the
senate
delegation
that
conferred
with
the
house
delegation.
he'd
--
he
explicitly
reaffirmed
all
that
i
have
said
and
all
that
is
held
in
the
rio
grande
case
saying
that
the
jurisdiction
of
congress
was
limited
to
what
they
called
feeders
that
is
tributaries
of
navigable
waters.
the
jurisdiction
was
never
limited
to
what
would
affect
the
downstream
waters
and
assured
his
fellow
senators
who
were
somewhat
apprehensive
about
an
extension
of
federal
power
in
that
respect
that
he
went
no
farther
than
that
and
they
were
not
attempting
to
interfere
with
the
present
situation.
that's
of
some
importance.
but
a
much
greater
importance
in
my
judgment
is
the
history
of
the
1935
legislation.
there
in
1935
this
whole
--
the
water
power
act
was
revised
thoroughly.
as
i
have
said,
section
23
was
amended
in
four
respects,
important
respects,
three
of
them.
parts
2
and
3
were
added
into
the
act
and
most
of
that
whole
bill
incorporating
those
amendments
was
part
2,
title
2
of
the
public
utility
act
of
1935.
and
those
amendments
were
sponsored
by
the
federal
power
commission.
we've
set
out
in
appendix
c
of
the
brief
--
of
our
brief
the
statements
made
by
some
of
the
members
of
the
commission,
the
chairman
appeared
and
tendered
the
services
of
the
--
his
associates
and
of
the
solicitor.
and
then
--
i'm
only
going
to
mention
one
or
two
important
things
here,
commissioner
cv
of
the
federal
power
commission
filed
a
memorandum
which
is
set
out
at
page
93,
set
out
in
--
a
part
of
it
relating
to
section
210
which
is
the
section
that
amended
what's
now
23
(b),
relating
to
this
various
section
it's
involved
here.
he
set
out
a
memorandum
and
first
referred
to
the
fact
that
they
were
incorporating
into
the
section
the
provisions
prohibiting
any
unlicensed
construction
in
the
navigable
stream.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
it's
page
93
of
our
brief
sir,
your
honor
of
--
in
appendix
c
--(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
its
entitled
amendments
of
present
sections
of
the
water
power
act
and
section
210.
we've
emphasized
the
court
below.
he
first
referred
to
the
fact
that
they
were
writing
this
first
sentence
of
bringing
the
control
over
navigable
waters
into
this
section.
and
then
we're
making
it
mandatory
to
file
a
declaration
of
intent
--
intention
for
a
construction
in
non-navigable
tributary
and
then
he
said
contrary
to
my
promise,
i'd
like
to
read
this
if
your
honors
will
indulge
me.
under
this
section,
has
amended
every
person
intending
to
construct
a
project
which
might
conceivably
affect
any
navigable
waters.
waters
would
be
under
the
duty
coming
to
the
commission.
the
act
would
be
greatly
strengthened
by
enabling
the
commission
to
preserve
control
over
all
projects
with
which
the
federal
government
has
any
valid
concern.
the
effect
of
that
i
think
without
taking
anymore
time
about
it
is
that
the
concern
of
the
federal
government,
the
valid
that
concern
is
protection
there
and
--
improvement
of
navigable
waters
and
that
that's
what
this
section
23
does.
now
that
--
my
time
is
very
limited
i
see
by
my
white
light
here
and
i
want
to
cover
a
point
if
i
may
here
before
i
close.
that
assurance
given
by
commissioner
cv
was
adopted
by
both
the
house
committee
and
senate
committee
and
reported
on
this
bill.
they
had
--
they
received
and
accepted
that
insurance
--
assurance
and
incorporated
it
in
their
own
reports
and
no
doubt
thereby
relieved
the
apprehensions
of
many
members
of
both
houses
of
congress
that
this
section
might
carry
further.
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
are
affirmed
--
mr.
robert
j.
keefe
well,
the
first
thing
i
have
to
say
about
it
your
honor
is
stated
2.2a
of
our
brief
that
they
did
not
raise
the
question
as
a
ground
for
certiorari.
as
i've
--
the
facts
are
stated
about
that
and
that's
up
to
the
court.
the
second
thing
about
it
in
the
same
connection
is
that
it's
a
factual
question.
if
your
honors
wish
to
take
it
--
important
to
consider
it.
that
should
be
taken
in.
it's
of
--
it's
a
factual
question.
what
the
court
below
decided
contrary
to
their
appraisal
of
its
decision.
what
the
court
decided
was
that
there
was
no
substantial
evidence
to
support
that
finding.
that
the
downstream
navigability
would
be
affected,
so
it's
factual.
now
on
the
thing
they
argued
the
exact
thing
they
argue
and
it
was
argued
here
orally.
they
surveyed
--
indicate
--
in
part
say
that
the
basis
of
the
court's
decision
was
that
if
there
should
be
any
untoward
effect,
it
could
be
corrected
later
by
action
under
what's
called
section
4
(g)
of
the
act.
that's
the
section
that
gives
the
commission
the
very
broad
power
of
investigation
of
any
project
--
any
construction
in
the
stream
and
to
correct
anything
that
maybe
wrong.
and
to
issue
such
orders
as
maybe
appropriate.
now
the
court
did
point
that
out
by
way
of
a
comment
to
the
end
of
its
opinion
but
not
by
--
not
as
the
basis
of
his
--
of
its
opinion.
all
it
said
about
that
was
that
if
in
effect
--
i'm
not
quoting,
if
there
should
be
any
change
in
the
future
this
decision
that
we're
rendering
won't
bar
appropriate
commission
action.
they
have
full
authority
under
section
4
(g)
to
make
an
investigation
and
to
issue
an
appropriate
order
but
they've
taken
that
comment
by
the
court
as
the
basis
of
the
court's
decision
which
it
is
not
and
upon
the
basis
--
upon
that
theory,
they
argued
here
that
the
--
that
congress
and
the
commission
are
not
limited
to
remedial
action,
to
correct
an
injury
that's
already
been
done
but
may
take
preventive
measures
to
issue
preventive
regulations.
but
of
course
they
may
--
we
never
disputed
that
and
if
that's
the
question,well,
of
course
it
isn't
the
question.
but
we
could
know
possible
doubt
about
that.
it
isn't
necessary
and
argued
but
that
issue
hasn't
anything
to
do
with
this
case.
now,
that's
the
only
thing
they
argue
under
this
--
about
the
navigability,
the
only
thing.
what
the
court
actually
decided
was
that
the
commission's
finding
was
based
upon
mere
speculation.
it
ignored
positive
evidence
contrary
to
it.
for
one
thing,
it
ignored
the
opinion
of
the
--
from
the
office
of
the
chief
of
engineers
that
this
project
would
not
affect
a
navigability
of
the
black
river
and
that
the
plans
of
the
project
were
satisfactory
so
far
as
the
interest
of
navigation
were
concerned
that
positive
opinion
it
ignored.
it
indulged
in
a
great
--
like
the
examiner
did
this.
the
commission
was
not
much
concerned
about
this
point.
it
was
concerned
about
the
other
point
about
statutory
interpretation
and
warded
nearly
all
of
its
opinions
of
that.
but
it
had
adopted
the
examiner's
findings.
well,
the
examiner's
findings
are
wrong
in
many
respects
but
among
others
in
ignoring
that
and
in
ignoring
also
another
fact
which
was
stipulated,
the
facts
about
this
were
stipulated
by
the
parties.
and
one
of
the
facts
was
that
the
maximum
possible
effect
on
what's
--
on
the
stage
in
flow,
stage
of
course
being
the
level
of
the
water
and
flow
--
the
rate
at
which
the
water
flowed.
the
maximum
possible
effects
were
less
and
frequently
occurred
without
any
project
being
there
at
all.
and
the
language
of
the
stipulation
unless
you
have
time
--
i'll
take
time
to
find
it
but
i
know
it
so
well
that
i
think
i
can
state
it
accurately
that
on
numerous
occasions,
natural
conditions
have
produced
greater
changes
in
stage
and
flow
in
equal
periods
of
time.
now
we're
talking
about
the
navigability
of
the
stream
(inaudible)
that
has
--
that
is
very
limited.
this
a
little
stream
in
missouri.
it's
shown
historically
that
it
has
--
it's
capable
of
floating
logs,
timber
and
that's
historic.
floating
logs
and
timber
and
here
are
--
the
only
thing
the
examiner
had
were
changes
in
the
stage
of
the
river,
the
maximum
would
be
a
change
of
3.4
feet
raising
the
level
of
the
water
that
much
at
the
annapolis
gate
over
a
period
of
14
and
a
half
hours
at
a
rate
of
6/10ths
of
1
foot
per
hour
and
