justice
byron
r.
white
--
just
directed
at
the
kind
of
a
finding
that
the
commission
had
to
make.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
to
what
kind
of
an
effect
on
commerce.
it's
not
really
a
question
of
initial
jurisdiction
over
the
non-navigable
streams,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
about
this
project?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
--
but
you're
suggesting
that
congress
does
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
whatever
that
means
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nobody
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there's
no
question
that
this
--
that
the
--
that
whether
you're
right
or
wrong
in
this,
there's
no
question
that
the
initial
--
well,
put
it
this
way,
do
they
say
--
do
your
opponents
say
have
no
obligation
whatsoever
to
file
a
declaration
of
intention?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
the
words
over
which
congress
has
jurisdiction
--
the
non-navigable
stream
over
which
congress
has
jurisdiction.
no
one
argued
to
what
--
this
is
one
of
those
kind
of
streams.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
there
any
--
given
your
construction
are
there
any
electric
projects
on
a
stream
of
any
kind
--
any
kind
of
stream
which
have
--
would
be
outside
the
commissions
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
the
--
it's
a
project
which
--
where
the
power
is
to
be
used
interstate?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
interstate
and
then
what
kind
of
a
project
would
still
nevertheless
be
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
regardless
of
the
nature
of
the
stream.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
my
question
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
my
question
is
just
directed
at
one
--
at
giving
some
context
or
words
in
the
act
which
say
over
which
the
non-navigable
stream
over
which
congress
had
some
jurisdiction
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
know
what
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
know
they
should
file
a
declaration
of
intention?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
just
as
clear
as
it
can
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
regulates
when
you're
supposed
to
file
a
declaration.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
so
that
has
really
nothing
to
do
with
what
kind
of
a
finding
the
commission
was
make
later.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
jurisdiction
it
could
--
the
jurisdiction
is
at
least
goes
to
the
extent
of
making
--
a
file
of
declaration?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
have
any
problem
at
all
in
deciding
whether
this
is
a
non-navigable
stream
over
which
congress
has
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
provision
there
--
defining
where
--
when
you're
supposed
to
file
a
declaration
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
content
of
this
later
language
as
to
the
finding
that
congress
must
make?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
wouldn't
--
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
the
congress
could
have
wanted
to
require
the
licensing
of
any
interstate
electrical
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
claim
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
i'm
just
saying
that
you
would
agree
that
congress
could
regulate
all
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
steam
and
water
plants,
if
they're
going
to
carry
electricity
interstate?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
aren't
they
--
isn't
the
government
in
effect
arguing
or
saying
that
congress
is
saying
that
you
require
a
license
for
all
plants
which
carry
power
interstate
if
they're
build
on
the
stream?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it,
do
you
also
in
your
brief
really
--
to
me
anyway,
you
pose
the
question
of
why
congress
--
how
you
can
possibly
ascribe
to
congress
an
intention,
to
require
a
license
for
a
plant
on
a
river
without
regard
to
navigability.
require
a
license
for
a
plant
on
a
river
and
yet
not
require
a
license
for
a
plant
10
miles
away,
a
steam
plant
10
miles
away
and
both
of
them
generating
interstate
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
what
dif
--
if
the
government
is
right,
navigability
has
--
got
anything
to
do
with
whether
or
not
a
license
is
required
except
by
saying
that
the
only
interstate
power
plants
we're
going
to
regulate
are
ones
that
just
happen
to
be
on
a
river.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
but
if
the
government
is
right,
they're
saying
that
congress
intended
to
regulate
only
interstate
power
plants
which
are
located
on
a
river,
none
others.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
possible
motive
could
there
be
for
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
at
least
the
larger
ones.
justice
