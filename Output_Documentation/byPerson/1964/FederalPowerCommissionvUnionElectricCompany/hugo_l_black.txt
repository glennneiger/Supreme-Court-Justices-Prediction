when
was
the
act
passed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
not
after
the
three
courts
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
1964?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
year
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i
think
while
--
the
words
my
brother
white's
referred
to
are
important,
i
think
they
are
modified
are
they
not
under
its
authority
to
regulate
commerce?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
it
was
plain
that
what
they
meant
i
suppose
was
not
that
--
it's
not
to
stop
to
say
a
non-navigable
stream
but
under
its
authority
which
has
jurisdiction
--
under
its
authority
of
regulating
commerce.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
were
discussing
the
history
in
the
several
congress
issues,
do
you
know
when
this
part
came
in
to
it,
where
they
i
said
over
which
it
has
authority
--
jurisdiction
under
it's
authority
to
regulate
commerce
because
to
me
that's
a
rather
important
part?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
be
--
what
would
be
your
position
if
the
sole
object
or
purpose
of
the
project
was
to
send
all
of
its
power
into
interstate
commerce?
would
that
make
any
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
logically
it
would
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
asked
you
that
question
because
i'm
reading
the
part
of
the
act
to
which
you
referred
on
page
45
of
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
be
divided
into
two
parts
i
would
like
to
add
the
(inaudible).
any
person,
association,
corporation,
state
or
municipality
intending
to
construct
a
dam
or
other
contract
projects
across,
along,
over
or
in
any
stream
are
part
thereof
other
than
those
defined
here
in
its
navigable
streams
and
over
which
congress
has
jurisdiction
under
its
power
to
regulate
commerce
for
foreign
nations
among
the
several
states
shall
before
such
construction
file
a
declaration
and
so
forth.
all
of
which,
it
has
jurisdiction,
it
has
two.
and
one
of
them,
it's
jurisdictions
in
navigable
water.
the
other
one
is
where
they're
going
to
construct
the
dam
along,
over
or
in
a
stream.
if
congress
has
jurisdiction
under
its
authority
to
regulate
commerce
to
foreign
nation
over
which.
now,
are
they
talking
there
about
dams
or
are
they
talking
about
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
projects,
are
they
talking
about
projects
or
are
they
talking
about
water?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
project
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
says
over
which
congress
has
jurisdiction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
there,
they're
talking
about
the
water?
justice
hugo
l.
black
before
you
leave
that,
may
i
ask
you
this
one
more
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
this
plant
has
just
been
put
up
in
the
middle
of
missouri
away
from
any
stream,
navigable
or
non-navigable,
the
sole
purpose
was
to
generate
power
and
sell
it
to
the
every
state
in
the
union,
that's
all
it's
going
to
do.
what
(inaudible)?
could
the
state
--
could
the
government
require
a
license?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
could
it
require
--
could
it
require
this
right?you
said,
could
not
under
this
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
other
statute
which
permits
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
would
affect
it
whether
its
on
the
river
or
off
the
river,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
here
is
that
at
least
so
far
as
this
statute
is
concerned,
congress
didn't
exercise
its
power
to
advise,
if
it
happen
to
be
along
side
of
the
stream.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is

justice
hugo

i
have
it.
