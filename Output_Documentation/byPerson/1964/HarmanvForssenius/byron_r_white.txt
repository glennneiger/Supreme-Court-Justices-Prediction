justice
byron
r.
white
but
these
(inaudible)
constitution
before
you
established
it,
this
is
the
qualification
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we'd
still
be
having
(inaudible)
--
i
understand
it
to
be
such
--
this
qualifications.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
still
have
to
(inaudible)
the
procedure
whether
or
not
the
(inaudible)
is
substantially
different
on
the
meaning
to
be
different
in
any
way
from
the
qualifications
that
of
the
state,
is
that
correct?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
--
did
the
(inaudible)
decided
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you,
the
poll
tax
(inaudible)
collectible
whether
you
vote
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
you
--
could
you
send
out
the
poll
tax
return,
(inaudible)
first
suppose
to
file?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
the
personal
property
tax
return
itself
is
really
the
source
of
your
information
as
to
residence?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
rather
than
the
poll
--
rather
than
the
payment
of
the
poll
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
in
payment
of
your
personal
property
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
endorse
the
â€“
(inaudible)
when
you
got
your
poll
tax,
(inaudible).
i'm
here,
send
it
back
and
the
--
without
the
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
have
the
witness.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
he
wants,
the
admission,
why
do
you
require
a
proof
with
other
--
from
another
kind
of
political
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
if
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
where
do
you
have
to
file
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
do
you
have
to
file
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
widener
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that's
virginia,
how
does
virginia
ascertain
who
the
residents
are
for
the
purposes
of
voting?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
a
permanent
registration,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
you
don't
have
to
register
for
every
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
suggest
that
virginia
has
no
other
device
to
check
up
on
-
to
determine
who
were
the
qualified
electors?
justice
byron
r.
white
aren't
they
required
to
post
the
qualified
electors
at
the
voting
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
do
they
get
that
--
where
did
they
get
that
information?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you're
suggesting
that
the
poll
tax
is
no
proof
of
residence
and
shouldn't
be
considered
such
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that
isn't,
what's
the
proof
of
resident
--
residence?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
it
isn't
very
good
and
it
wasn't
intended
to
be
that
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
it
is
some
evidence
of
residence?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
virginia
can
require
some
evidence
of
(inaudible)
--
of
residence?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
every
voter
unless
he's
--
and
unless
he's
challenged,
the
voter
doesn't
have
to
make
that
kind
of
an
affidavit.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
have
any
idea
of
--
would
you
be
up
here
arguing
if
the
bill
that
they
sent
along
with
the
poll
tax
had
on
it
the
--
essentially
the
information
which
the
certificate
has
on
it
and
that
required
witnesses.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
fellow
who
sent
back
the
poll
tax
to
vote
in
a
state
election,
had
to
pay
a
dollar
and
a
half
and
he
had
to
sign
a
bill
and
had
said,
"i'm
going
to
be
resident,
i
intend
to
be
a
resident
until
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
i'm
just
saying
they
put
a
certificate
right
on
the
back
of
the
poll
tax
bill.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
they
sent
it
to
him
with
the
poll
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
they
have
forms
of
registration?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
this
a
--
isn't
this
really
an
additional
argument
that
really
the
certificate
requirement
reaches
people
that
the
poll
tax
requirement
never
reached.
the
state
sends
bills
to
the
--
only
seeks
the
poll
tax,
rather
that
the
poll
tax
would
be
paid
people
who
paid
personal
property
taxes?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
register
for
federal
elections?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
you've
got
two.
justice
byron
r.
white
have
to
be
(inaudible)
to
file
a
certificate
before,
do
you
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
your
argument
also
is
that
you
say
that
this
really
isn't
--
that
the
qualifications
for
the
federal
elector
really
aren't
equivalent
to
that
of
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
your
--
to
me
is
of
--
is
it
equivalent
or
not,
is
a
way
of
measuring
operation
rather
than
they're
right
or
wrong
in
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
example,
you
wouldn't
say
really
--
do
you
think
here,
your
argument
to
the
extent
that
federal
electors
have
to
file
a
pink
registration
statement
and
that
the
state
electors
have
to
file
a
white
registration?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
and
then
yet
your
right
--
they
just
have
no
right
to
put
them
in
a
separate
category,
would
--
wouldn't
you
argue
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
--
you
don't
think
they
ought
to
be
able
to
make
--
to
file
a
pink
registration
statement.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
a
burdensome,
aren't
they?
they
have
to
get
to
--
you
have
to
get
(inaudible)
and
understand
the
difference
in
the
qualifications?
justice
byron
r.
white
more
burden.
justice
byron
r.
white
more
burden.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
you
have
to
get
pretty
close
to
that
argument
so
to
make
it
violative
of
the
twenty-fourth
amendment,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
poll
tax
has
to
be
paid
within
a
certain
time
before
the
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
have
to
do
it
by
may.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
have
to
do
it
by
may,
that's
what
(inaudible)
--
how
--
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
poll
tax
bill
had
on
it
just
a
statement
that
said,
i
choose
not
to
pay
the
tax
and
we'll
vote
only
in
federal
elections.
then
they
get
to
return
the
bill
on.
that's
all
the
federal
elector
had
to
do,
you
wouldn't
have
any
problem.
