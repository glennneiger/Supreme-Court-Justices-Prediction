justice
hugo

meant,
aggregate,
in
the
aggregate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
--
what
do
you
use
that
fund
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
never
been
devoted
has
it
to
the
cost
of
the
election?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
as
in
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
in
the
past
or
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
it
--
when
was
the
class
--
when
was
that
first
inclusion
in
the
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
one
where
the
constitution
was
amended
in
several
respects
to
make
it
more
difficult
to
vote?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
senator
glass?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
not
read
the
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much
is
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
he
is
--
what
he's
saying
out
--
about
the
poll
tax?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
i
get
you
--
are
you
saying
that
this
requirement
is
spreaded
with
all
the
impediment
that
made
the
congress
decide
--
to
outlaw
the
poll
tax.
and
is
that
the
sense
on
which
you're
using
the
burden?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
he
required
to
--
on
your
judgment
under
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
in
order
to
vote
in
the
virginia
elections
where
they
are
electing
representatives
and
senators?
justice
hugo
l.
black
try
to
register?
well
what
in
your
judgment
would
be
the
effect
of
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
must
he
register
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
is,
do
you
agree
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
anybody
have
used
the
word
abridge.
i
thought
the
defendant
use
the
word
"abridge"?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
heard
anyone
used
it
this
morning.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
gather
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
looking
at
the
words
of
the
amendment,
it
says
this,
he
should
not
be
denied
a
right
--
citizens
to
vote
in
these
elections,
shall
not
be
denied
or
abridged
by
the
united
states
or
any
state
by
reason
of
failure
to
pay
any
poll
tax
or
other
tax.
then
your
whole
issue
whether
or
not
is
a
right
to
vote
as
abridged.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
isn't
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
that
be
better
than
the
word
burden?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
burden
might
be
an
abridgement,
because
wouldn't
it
be
better
to
talk
about
abridgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
doesn't
the
amendment
provide
itself
what
should
be
considered
an
abridgement?
anything
that's
done
by
a
reason
of
the
requirement
to
pay
(inaudible)
a
poll
tax,
isn't
that
what
it
says?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
reason
of
failure
to
pay
a
poll
tax.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
i
suppose
our
issue
as
the
courts
below
was
to
do
decide
whether
or
not
within
the
common
sense
meaning
of
the
term
abridge,
what's
been
done
here
and
what
you
do,
if
i
am
to
vote,
abridges
his
right
to
vote
where
a
con
--
where
the
constitution
evidently
intended
to
be
holding
completely
free
any
impediment
of
any
kind
of
character
that
abridge
his
right
to
vote.
justice
hugo
l.
black
important
by
reason
of
paying
the
poll
tax.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then--
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
be
a
strange
construction
of
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
a
constitution
amendment
perhaps,
my
question
wrong?
(inaudible)
when
the
man
has
to
register
like
the
other
people
i
should
say.
he
has
to
register
to
vote,
doesn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
know
he
is
registered,
they
know
he
is
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
they
wanted
to
do
it
when
he
registers
they
could
ask
him
if
he's
living
at
--
(inaudible)
street
or
some
place
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
what
i'm
getting
at
is,
why
can't
they
when
they
considered
residence
of
purging
and
challenging,
why
can't
they
consider
this
point
of
whether
he
is
a
qualified
voter
then.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
your
claiming
as
i
understand
it
is
the
right
to
utilize
the
method
which
they
say
was
utilized
for
that
purpose
before,
saying
that
since
he
doesn't
now
have
to
pay
a
poll
tax.
they
want
to
transfer
and
substitute
for
--
requirement
that
they
required
for
registration
with
the
requirement
now
for
him
to
vote.
