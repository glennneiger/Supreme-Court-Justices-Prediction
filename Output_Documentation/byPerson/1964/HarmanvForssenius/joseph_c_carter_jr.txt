mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
stating
precisely
the
issues
in
this
case
on
appeal
and
the
facts
out
of
which
they
arose
may
i
first
draw
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
fact
that
the
basic
underlying
issue
here
is
the
constitutionality
of
a
single
section
of
the
virginia
code
designated
as
section
24—17.2
and
appearing
at
the
middle
of
page
9
in
the
record.
this
statute
is
entitled
proof
of
residence;
how
it
furnish
and
it
states
the
methods
available
to
prove
residence
of
the
qualification
for
voting
in
elections
held
in
virginia.
with
this
general
question
in
mind
may
i
now
state
the
precise
questions
on
appeal
in
this
case,
first
of
all
as
stated
appellant's
opening
brief,
did
the
court
below
err
in
holding
this
statute,
section
24—17.2
invalid
under
article
i,
section
2
and
the
seventeenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
as
creating
a
new
qualification
for
voting
in
congressional
elections
which
was
not
required
for
voting
in
elections
for
the
most
numerous
branch
of
the
general
assembly
of
virginia.
question
number
two,
did
the
court
below
err
in
issuing
on
the
authority
of
article
i,
section
2
and
the
seventeenth
amendment
a
general
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
which
injunction
applied
in
presidential
elections
as
well
as
congressional
election.
number
three,
did
the
court
below
err
in
denying
two
preliminary
motions
by
the
appellants
on
a
motion
to
state
the
proceedings
under
the
doctrine
of
abstention
and
the
other,
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
join
indispensible
parties
and
for
lack
of
standing
to
sue
on
the
part
of
the
complainants.
now,
these
three
questions
have
been
added
two
other
since
the
brief
for
the
appellees
and
the
amicus
brief
for
the
government
has
been
filed
in
this
case.
the
first
is
and
this
is
the
thread
of
argument
that
seems
to
run
throughout
the
brief
of
the
appellees,
does
the
statute.
section
24—17.2
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution?
and
i
hope
in
view
of
the
opinion
announced
this
morning
as
well
as
the
shortness
of
time
that
i
may
reserve
an
opportunity
to
answer
this
argument
later.
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
united
states,
we
have
presented
for
the
first
time
the
question,
does
this
section
of
the
virginia
code
violate
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
itself
without
more
and
without
reference
to
other
constitutional
provisions?
the
facts
of
the
case
maybe
stated
briefly
as
follows;
prior
to
the
ratification
of
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
last
year,
the
constitution
of
virginia
in
sections
18
and
20
and
the
virginia
code
in
the
implementing
sections
24—17
and
24—67
provided
a
uniform
rule
for
registration
and
voting
of
electors
in
all
election,
state
and
federal.
the
qualifications
for
voting
set
forth
in
section
18
of
the
virginia
constitution
are
as
follows;
u.s.
citizenship,
21
years
of
age,
residence
in
the
state
one
year,
the
city
or
county
six
months
and
the
voting
precinct
30
days
prior
to
the
election
in
question.
number
four,
registration
to
vote
under
section
20
of
the
constitution
and
number
five,
payment
of
poll
taxes.
the
qualifications
for
a
registration
set
forth
in
section
20
of
the
virginia
constitution
are
virtually
the
same
as
those
for
voting
contained
in
section
18,
they're
restated
in
section
20
including
poll
tax
claims.
but
under
section
20
of
the
virginia
constitution
the
applicant
must
complete
and
sign
in
the
presence
of
the
registration
officer
an
application
for
registration
which
states
the
required
qualifications
outlined
in
that
constitutional
section.
and
it's
also
answered
under
oath
any
additional
questions
as
to
those
precise
qualifications
which
may
be
put
to
him
by
the
registration
officer.
but
to
answer
to
those
questions
on
the
written
applications
filed
must
be
certified
by
that
officer
and
kept
by
him
as
permanent
records.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
no
sir.
the
poll
tax
payment
is
only
one
of
the
four
qualifications
for
registration
and
of
the
five
qualifications
for
voting.
he
must
still
when
he
goes
to
register
--
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
yes
sir.
at
the
same
time
payment
of
the
poll
tax
became
a
voter
qualification
in
virginia,
this
has
been
some
years
ago.
permanent
registration
became
a
practical
institution
there.
that
means
that
once
a
voter
is
registered
in
the
first
place
he
remains
on
the
registration
role
until
he
dies
or
moves
away
or
take
some
voluntary
action
to
have
himself
removed.
as
a
practical
matter,
his
name
remains
there
for
many
years.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
is
generally
correct.
may
i
say
however
that
this
particular
section
to
which
i
referred
at
the
outset
was
adapted
as
a
consequence
to
the
ratification
of
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
and
it
simply
says
that
as
a
qualification
of
voting
not
registration
there,
i
thought
mr.
justice
douglas'
question
was
directed
in
registration
action
but
as
a
condition
of
voting
when
he
comes
to
the
poll
he
must
have
proved
his
continuing
residence
by
means
of
payment
of
the
poll
tax
that's
one
alternative
for
filing
a
certificate
or
register
–
continuing
residence
which
is
the
second
alternative.
and
i
might
point
out
that
in
the
statute
itself
it
is
specified
that
these
proofs
are
required
only
in
years
subsequent
to
registration
because
when
you
go
in
to
register
you
must
file
and
under
oath
a
statement
of
these
various
thing
for
applications.
now,
obviously
to
prevent
fraudulent
voting
and
irregularities
at
the
polls
there
had
to
be
some
practical
means
of
checking
this
permanent
registration
list.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
mr.
justice
goldberg,
in
our
constitution
it
is
provided
that
a
person
may
vote
at
a
primary
election
which
by
that
same
constitution
has
held
six
months
prior
to
the
general
election
if
he
is
qualified
at
the
time
of
the
general
election.
so,
as
a
consequence
the
practical
machinery
for
approving
qualifications
is
set
six
months
in
advance
of
the
general
election.
and
i
will
get
to
that
particular
point
in
more
detail
because
it
has
been
raised
by
the
government
in
the
amicus
brief
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
the
government's
position.
now,
prior
to
the
ratification
of
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
when
you
went
to
the
polling
place
to
vote
in
virginia
and
you
saw
three
officials
behind
the
table,
first
official
had
the
registration
list,
he
give
you
names
and
he
checks
you
off
of
that
list.
the
second
official
had
a
list
of
persons
who
had
paid
the
poll
tax,
you
check
off
of
that
list.
the
third
official
has
the
ballot
and
gives
it
to
you
and
records
your
name
as
voting
in
that
particular
election.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
both
of
the
preceding
lists.
now,
had
this
particular
statute
gone
into
effect,
section
24—17.2
that
second
official
to
whom
i
refer
would've
had
two
lists
in
front
of
him.
one
would
have
been
the
list
of
persons
who
have
paid
the
poll
tax,
the
other
persons
who
have
filed
a
certificate
of
continuing
residence
and
if
your
name
appeared
on
either
of
those
then
you
would
be
given
the
ballot
and
allowed
to
vote.
when
ratification
of
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
appeared
to
be
imminent,
it
was
obvious
that
extensive
changes
in
the
election
of
machinery
in
the
procedural
aspect
of
elections
in
virginia
had
to
be
made.
the
reason
for
that
was
clear.
you
have
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
of
virginia
pressing
you
on
one
side,
the
twenty-fourth
amendment,
pressing
you
on
the
other
and
it
was
pointing
obvious
that
something
had
to
be
done
and
done
quickly
prior
to
the
elections
in
1964.
the
governor
of
virginia
accordingly
convened
an
extra
session
of
the
virginia
general
assembly
at
the
end
of
november
in
1963
and
made
to
it
an
address
containing
certain
recommendations
for
changes
in
virginia's
election
laws.
in
summary,
his
mess
--
his
message
contained
the
following
recommendations.
number
one,
the
numerous
and
complicated
provisions
of
the
constitution
of
virginia
relating
to
elections
and
voting
and
the
poll
tax
requirements
that
had
formally
been
in
effect
in
all
elections
should
not
and
indeed
could
not
be
rewritten
and
submitted
to
the
people
in
time
for
use
in
the
1964
election.
and
number
two,
he
recommended
that
statute
should
be
enacted
to
render
inoperative
in
federal
election
under
the
authority
of
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
the
payment
of
poll
tax
as
a
qualification
for
voting
and
as
a
qualification
for
registration
as
well.
he
finally
went
on
to
recommend
however
that
the
general
assembly
should
leave
in
effect
all
the
qualifications
for
registration
and
voting
in
the
virginia
constitution
including
the
payment
of
the
poll
tax
so
that
the
poll
tax
remains
in
effect
in
state
elections
as
it
is
permitted
to
do
by
the
twenty-fourth
amendment.
the
general
assembly
followed
these
recommendations.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
it
is
clear
from
the
language
and
the
legislative
history
of
that
amendment
that
it
was
directed
--
pinpointed
indeed
at
federal
elections
only.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that
mr.
justice
goldberg
nor
that
i
mean
to
imply
anything
about
the
policy
recommendations
of
the
governor.
i
only
meant
to
say
that
it
was
permitted
to
remain
in
effect
in
state
elections.
now,
the
general
assembly
enacted
two
special
enactments
at
that
session
to
which
i
refer.
the
first
one
applied
only
to
the
elections
of
1964
and
thus
is
now
moot.
the
second
enactment
contains
section
24—17.2
which
i
have
been
discussing
prior
to
this
time.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
on
yesterday
prior
to
the
recess,
the
issues
in
this
case
had
been
stated
and
the
statement
of
facts
had
been
substantially
completed.
i
had
just
apprised
the
court
of
the
facts
concerning
a
special
session
of
the
general
assembly
of
virginia
held
in
november
of
1963
which
enacted
certain
revisions
of
the
election
laws
so
as
to
make
them
workable
in
the
practice
with
the
total
tax
requirement
for
registration
and
voting
inoperative
in
federal
elections
as
required
by
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
but
operative
in
state
and
local
elections.
the
only
one
of
these
statutory
revisions
that
was
held
invalid
by
the
court
below
and
the
only
one
which
is
the
subject
of
this
appeal
is
section
24-17.
2
to
which
i
referred
yesterday
which
establishes
two
optional
methods
by
which
a
registered
voter
in
years
subsequent
to
the
year
in
which
he
registered
must
prove
his
revenues
as
a
qualification
for
voting.
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
having
been
formally
ratified
in
january
of
1964,
the
statutes
involved
here
became
effective
by
their
terms
on
february
19,
1964.
two
declaratory
judgment
actions
and
these
cases
were
instituted
by
the
appellees
on
the
very
next
day,
february
20,
1964.
and
the
order
of
the
court
below
was
entered
on
may
the
29th.
a
stay
was
refused
by
this
court
in
june
of
1964
and
consequently
the
final
order
of
the
court
went
into
effect
on
july
1
of
last
year.
when
you
look
at
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
in
this
case,
you
will
see
that
in
the
very
first
sentence,
that
court
concluded
that
the
statute
involved
here
created
a
new
and
additional
substantive
qualification
for
voting
in
virginia.
a
qualification
which
the
court
said
was
demanded
of
federal
voters
only
and
not
of
state
voters.
thus,
the
reason
of
the
court,
this
qualification
is
invalid
under
article
i,
section
2
and
the
seventeenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
this
initial
conclusion
at
the
very
start
of
the
opinion
is
the
cornerstone
of
the
entire
reasoning
of
the
court
below.
and
we
believed
that
it
is
plainly
and
fundamentally
erroneous.
it's
quite
clear
we
believe
that
article
i,
section
2
and
the
seventeenth
amendment
contemplate
that
the
people
of
the
states
must
first
establish
qualifications
for
voting
in
their
state
constitutions.
which
qualifications
are
then
adopted
by
those
two
sections
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
are
thereby
made
qualifications
for
voting
in
federal
and
congressional
elections
as
well.
this
court
and
numerous
other
authorities
have
repeatedly
observed
that
it
is
the
people
of
the
state
who
first
fixed
or
established
the
qualifications
for
voting
that
apply
in
federal
and
state
elections.
now
going
back
into
history,
all
of
the
states
in
this
nation
at
one
time
or
another
have
had
qualifications
based
on
qualifications
for
voting,
based
on
age,
or
residents,
or
sex,
or
race,
or
property
ownership,
payment
of
taxes,
literacy,
and
other
similar
qualifications.
but
of
course
the
power
to
fix
or
establish
these
qualifications
as
vested
in
the
people
of
the
states
by
article
i,
section
2
and
the
seventeenth
amendment
has
now
been
expressly
and
specifically
limited
by
the
fifteenth,
the
nineteenth,
and
the
twenty-fourth
amendments.
those
amendments
are
couched
in
very
similar
language
and
in
the
same
basic
form
although
the
last
one,
the
twenty-fourth
amendment,
is
the
only
one
that
applies
to
specified
federal
elections
only.
the
other
two
apply
to
all
elections
held
in
the
united
states.
now
each
of
these
amendments
rendered
inoperative
a
particular
type
of
qualification
for
voting
that
many
states
had
theretofore
had
in
their
own
constitutions.
but
none
we
submit
has
fundamentally
altered
the
basic
plan
whereby
it
is
the
people
of
the
states
who
first
fixed
the
qualifications
for
voting
and
those
qualifications
are
then
adapted
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
power
to
fix
or
established
voting
qualifications
has
also
been
limited
at
least
to
the
extent
of
procedural
and
implementation
statutes
by
the
requirements
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
subject
only
to
the
limitations
of
these
four
amendments
to
which
i
have
referred,
the
people
of
the
states
have
the
power
to
initiate
voting
qualifications.
now,
it
is
important
to
remember
that
the
state
courts
very
early
in
our
history
proclaimed
the
fundamental
constitutional
nature
of
voting
qualifications.
and
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
like
the
highest
courts
of
most
of
our
states
has
adopted
the
rule
that
substantive
qualifications
for
voting
must
originate
in
the
constitution
of
virginia
and
cannot
be
created
or
rescinded
by
mere
legislative
enactments
of
our
general
assembly.
this
rule
has
been
enunciated
in
three
different
virginia
cases
which
are
cited
on
page
13
of
our
opening
brief.
so,
if
the
statute
involved
here
section
24-17.2
created
a
qualification
as
the
court
below
reasoned
then
this
statute
would
be
invalid
under
the
constitution
of
virginia.
we
believe
and
we
argued
to
the
court
below
that
this
was
basically
a
question
of
state
law
as
to
whether
or
not
such
a
qualification
was
created.
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
we
moved
for
abstention
in
this
case,
feeling
that
surely
in
the
area
of
voting
qualifications
there
was
one
field
left
where
the
federal
courts
might
properly
divert
it
to
the
state
courts.
but
of
course
this
motion
was
overruled
by
the
court
below.
turning
now
to
the
constitution
--
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
whether
or
not
section
24-17.2
created
a
new
substantive
qualification
for
voting
that
had
never
existed
before
and
whether
it
would
thereby
be
invalid
under
the
constitution
of
virginia
as
a
mere
legislative
enactment.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
would
have
been
completely
disposed
off,
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
you
would
certainly
have
a
federal
question
left
in
that
situation,
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
no
sir,
mr.
justice
white,
i
do
not
believe
it
is
because
i
believe
the
question
assumes
--
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
that
is
quite
correct.
it's
--
it
has
been
our
argument
all
along
that
this
was
a
procedural
on
implementation
statutes
so
if
we
prevail
before
the
virginia
court
the
federal
question
would
remain.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
that
quest
--
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
excuse
me.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
that
is
quite
correct
your
honor.
turning
now
to
sections
18
and
20
of
the
constitution
of
virginia,
we
see
that
poll
tax
payment
has
been
a
qualification
for
registrative
--
for
registration
and
voting
in
virginia
for
many
years.
as
i
pointed
out
yesterday
--
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
that's
quite
correct.
but
i
believe
that
in
the
history
of
property
and
other
qualifications
for
voting
in
the
constitutions
of
various
states,
you
have
all
of
these
things,
age,
residence
--
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
--
and
so
on
--
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
mr.
justice
goldberg,
in
the
early
history
of
this
country
most
of
the
13
original
states,
all
but
two
i
believe
out
of
the
qualification
for
voting
property
ownership
--
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
well,
as
i
understand
it,
the
theory
was
at
that
time
that
property
ownership
did
give
a
man
an
attachment
to
the
community
and
an
interest
in
the
affairs
of
the
community
that
he
otherwise
would
not
have
had.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
has
ever
decided
that
a
property
qualification
would
be
unconstitutional.
now,
it's
interesting
to
note
that
in
some
of
the
original
senate
resolutions
which
were
the
forerunners
of
the
twenty-fourth
amendment,
you
had
a
prohibition
against
property
qualifications
and
poll
taxes.
but
when
the
final
resolution
was
adopted
by
the
congress,
the
property
qualification
was
left
out
and
the
amendment
was
limited
to
the
poll
tax.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
am.
my
theory
has
been
that
that
case
does
not
involve
voting
qualifications
in
the
constitutional
sense
that
we
are
discussing
here
today.
and
in
no
case
to
my
knowledge
have
you
had
a
situation
where
the
people
of
the
state
have
purported
to
adopt
the
qualification
of
that
kind
in
their
own
constitutions.
now,
as
i
pointed
out
yesterday
because
of
the
system
of
permanent
registration
in
virginia,
the
payment
of
the
poll
tax
has
had
a
very
practical
significance
in
the
working
of
the
election
machinery.
it
actually
was
the
means
by
which
the
various
voting
lists
were
kept
up
to
date.
and
thus,
it
had
a
dual
function
in
practice.
it
was
a
constitutional
qualification.
and
in
addition
to
that,
it
was
a
means
of
proving
continuing
residence
and
residence
of
course
is
a
separate
qualification
under
our
constitution.
therefore,
it
is
easy
to
see
that
in
order
to
give
effect
of
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
in
federal
elections
and
simultaneously
retain
the
poll
tax
in
the
state
elections,
some
method
was
necessary
to
keep
these
registration
lists
up
to
date.
and
the
method
that
the
general
assembly
of
virginia
chose
was
the
statute
which
is
before
this
court
today.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
the
total
is
a
dollar
and
a
half
per
year,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
my
understanding
is
that
it
has
average
about
a
million
dollars
a
year
for
several
years.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
one
dollar
of
the
fund
according
to
our
constitution
goes
to
public
free
schools
at
the
state
level.
fifty
cents
is
sent
back
to
the
localities
to
be
appropriated
as
they
see
fit.
in
most
cases
that
also
was
used
for
the
school
system.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
it
is
collectible
whether
you
vote
or
not.
the
statutes
of
virginia
now
provide
that
it
is
not
collectible
by
legal
process
until
after
it
remains
unpaid
for
three
years.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
all
i
know
about
the
lawsuit
is
the
story
in
the
morning
paper
but
that
is
correct
as
i
understand
it.
the
collection
of
the
poll
tax
after
three
years
falls
under
the
general
tax
collections
statutes
of
virginia.
and
it
is
my
understanding
that
it
can
be
collected
by
legal
process
--
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
no
sir,
not
at
all.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
i
think
that
is
quite
correct.
it's
--
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
i'm
sure
that's
a
correct
characterization
of
it.
we
believe
that
it
has
been
a
qualification
from
voting.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
a
qualification
of
--
for
voting
that
i
must
say
was
the
basic
purpose
--
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
--
of
the
poll
tax
requirement
in
the
past.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
in
the
past
and
now
in
the
state
elections
by
our
constitution
--
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
i
would
presume
that
mr.
justice
goldberg's
question
was
directed
to
the
basic
purpose
of
the
statute.
and
i
would
have
to
say
as
i
did
that
the
basic
purpose
and
the
whole
constitutional
framework
was
in
the
election
laws
that
the
qualification
for
voting
or
rather
than
being
basically
a
revenue
merger
is
undoubtedly
has
characteristics
to
the
both.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
in
its
present
form
of
the
first
included
in
the
1902,
the
constitution
of
1902
which
is
still
the
basic
constitutional
framework.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
there
is
in
the
records
of
that
constitution
several
statements
by
some
of
the
more
extreme
members
or
delegates
to
it
which
the
appellees
have
cited
in
their
briefs
indicating
that
the
basic
purpose
of
those
delegates
was
to
restrict
the
franchise.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
he
is
quoted
i
believe
in
the
appellee's
brief.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
now,
as
our
court
has
held
subsequent
to
that
time,
actually
it
was
in
the
case
of
butler
versus
thompson
passing
on
the
validity
of
the
poll
tax
itself
in
which
the
opinion
was
affirmed
by
this
court.
it
was
there
stated
that
the
quotation
from
those
particular
delegates
to
the
constitutional
convention
had
no
significance
at
this
time.
what
was
an
issue
in
that
case
of
court
was
the
basic
constitutional
validity
of
the
poll
tax
and
it
was
upheld
as
a
qualification
for
voting
claim.
now,
returning
to
the
opinion
of
the
court
below,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
basic
reasoning
behind
its
holding
was
that
the
court
felt
that
payment
of
the
poll
tax
was
just
not
a
trustworthy
means
of
proving
residence.
and
as
a
practical
matter
it
boiled
down
to
that
so
far
as
the
court
is
concerned.
now,
it's
our
contention
that
this
conclusion
was
unsupported
in
the
record.
there's
not
a
bit
of
evidence
in
this
case
to
contradict
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
before
the
court
today.
and
that
legislative
history
has
to
the
effect
that
in
practice
the
poll
tax
has
been
used
to
prove
residence.
moreover,
there
are
any
number
of
cases,
many
of
which
are
cited
in
our
brief
that
hold
--
that
in
situations
where
you
must
determine
residence
or
domicile
the
voluntary
payment
of
poll
taxes
and
other
personal
taxes
assessed
in
the
locality
is
the
best
possible
test
of
residents
that
you
can
have
in
those
situations.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
the
practice
in
most
by
our
local
jurisdictions,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
the
personal
property
tax
return,
the
tangible
personal
property
returns
contained
insu
--
contain
information
sufficient
for
the
assessment
of
the
poll
tax.
and
so
basically
the
list
of
poll
tax
of
people
who
are
required
to
pay
the
poll
tax
is
made
up
from
personal
property
return
and
bills
are
sent
out
to
the
persons
who
have
filed
a
return.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
that's
quite
correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
well,
the
voluntary
payment
of
the
poll
tax
we
believe
is
much
better
evidence
on
that
particular
subject.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
well,
the
personal
property
tax
bills
are
sent
out
to
all
persons
who
paid
them
the
year
before,
some
of
them
may
have
moved.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
we
believe
that
the
payment
of
the
poll
tax
and
the
payment
of
personal
property
taxes
as
well
are
both
indications
of
continued
residence.
now
the
legislature
shows
--
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
well
actually
sir,
the
certificate
required
in
24-17.2
is
very
little
more
than
that.
if
you
were
to
write
on
your
poll
tax
bill
the
essentials
of
the
information
required
in
the
certificate
and
sign
it
and
have
it
witnessed
and
send
it
back,
then
you
would
have
complied
with
the
section
which
is
before
the
court
today.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
and
no
form
--
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
either
witness
or
another
act,
that
is
in
accord
with
the
forms
that
we
viewed
in
virginia
for
many
years
in
absentee
voting
and
voting
by
persons
absent
in
the
armed
services.
in
fact,
the
certificate
is
patterned
very
closely
on
the
certificate
that
has
been
used
by
armed
service
voters
for
many
years
in
virginia.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
no
sir.
there
is
no
form
or
return
that
is
required
in
connection
with
payment
of
the
poll
tax
itself.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
voluntary
payment
of
that
tax.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
in
view
of
the
--
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
well,
it
has
been
pointed
out
in
many
of
the
cases
involving
poll
taxes
that
no
state
as
a
practical
matter
collects
them
by
legal
process.
obviously,
it
would
be
more
expensive
to
do
so
than
it
would
be
worth
making.
so
immediate
involuntary
return
of
that
money
says
the
general
assembly
of
virginia
constitutes
a
voluntary
admission
that
you
continue
as
a
resident
of
the
locality
which
sent
you
the
bill
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
and
as
i
say
we
have
cited
a
number
of
cases,
tax
cases,
particularly
state
tax
cases,
divorce
cases,
election
cases,
and
others
where
many,
many
courts
have
said
that
this
is
a
reasonable
and
a
proper
test
for
residence.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
i
suppose
that
depends
on
the
definition
of
the
word
proof.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
actually
both
alternatives
are
very,
very
simple.
both
are
admissions
in
my
judgment
that
you
are
a
resident,
either
the
certificate
or
the
payment
in
poll
tax.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
it
has
no
cost.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
generally
not
in
my
experience
in
virginia
and
of
course
it
can
be
witnessed
by
a
layman
and
does
not
have
to
be
notarized.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
the
certificate
of
residence
is
sent
in
to
the
treasurers
of
the
localities
or
the
commissioner's
revenue
who
happened
to
be
the
officers
charged
by
the
constitution
of
virginia
preparing
a
list
of
eligible
voters.
after
those
lists
are
prepared,
they
are
submitted
to
the
clerks
and
the
sheriffs,
and
they're
actually
posted
at
each
voting
place
in
virginia
prior
to
the
election.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
the
statutes
passed
by
the
general
assembly
in
1963
provide
that
the
state
board
of
elections
must
print
out
forms
of
these
certificates
and
distribute
those
forms
to
the
various
local
voting
registration
authorities.
the
statute
does
not
go
on
to
say
what
those
authorities
will
do
with
it
and
presumably
there
maybe
differences
in
practice,
some
may
distribute
them
widely
or
keep
them
in
their
offices
for
use.
i
can't
tell
but
i
should
point
out,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
that
the
statute
clearly
says
that
you
must
file
a
certificate
substantially
in
this
form
not
in
any
particular
form,
substantially
in
this
form.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
i
would
say
that
certainly
in
--
on
many
economic
levels
that
would
be
easier
and
less
burdensome
to
file
a
certificate
and
send
it
in.
if
it
is
true
as
many
have
argued
that
a
dollar
and
a
half
per
year
is
a
sufficient
amount
to
deter
people
from
voting
then
certainly
as
to
those
people
it
would
be
easier
to
fill
out
and
send
back
the
certificate.
in
other
cases
--
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
i
would
say
that
they
are
equally
reasonable.
i
don't
see
that
one
is
anymore
burdensome
than
the
other.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
that's
definitely
my
answer
in
my
own
case.
i
don't
see
any
burden
of
any
unreasonable
nature
at
all
involved
in
this
certificate.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
i
said,
i
didn't
see
any
difference
in
terms
of
trouble
involved
in
sending
back
one
or
the
other.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
point
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
if
he
does
not
make
that
particular
certification.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
no
sir,
the
general
assembly
doubtless
felt
that
payment
of
the
tax
was
sufficient
indication
that
he
intended
to
stay
there
until
the
election
in
order
to
vote.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
believe
he
would
automatically
be
disqualified
from
voting
at
the
election
because
he
would
no
longer
be
a
resident
under
--
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
--
section
18
of
the
constitution.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
he
would
be
disqualified
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
that
is
correct
but
--
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
the
general
assembly
in
this
case
and
the
judgment
of
the
appellants
simply
acted
on
the
basis
of
practical
experience
in
virginia
and
stated
what
it
felt
as
a
matter
of
legislative
power
constituted
evidence
of
residence,
residence
being
the
qualification
for
voting
with
which
we
are
concerned
here.
now,
it
is
not
up
to
us
in
this
case.
we
believe
to
show
any
more
than
that.
this
was
not
a
clearly
irrational
and
arbitrary
action
by
the
legislative
body.
surely,
it
had
to
file
to
act
on
the
basis
of
practical
experience
to
set
up
an
evidentiary
requirement
in
the
voting
area
just
as
it
may
set
up
evidentiary
requirements
in
other
areas
of
the
law.
i
will
move
on
now
to
the
second
issue
in
the
case
--
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
if
the
statute
in
this
case
was
as
we
deemed
it
to
be,
simply
our
requirement
for
proof
of
residence
then
i
would
not
feel
that
whether
or
not
it
slows
down
voting
as
any
constitutional
significance
because
all
qualifications
of
voting
whatever
their
nature
must
have
this
effect
of
slowing
down
voting
in
that
sense.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
if
the
classification
were
reasonable
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
we
will
argue
in
a
few
moments,
then
i
believe
that
a
state
could,
yes
sir.
completing
very
quickly
the
opening
argument
for
the
appellants,
may
i
say
that
the
second
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
the
order
of
the
court
should've
been
extended
to
elections
for
president
and
vice
president
on
the
basis
of
article
i,
section
2
in
the
seventeenth
amendment.
those
two
sections
of
the
constitution
apply
only
at
the
congressional
elections.
and
if
you
look
at
article
ii,
section
1
and
the
twelfth
amendment
which
deal
with
elections
for
president
and
vice
presidents,
it
is
clear
that
the
states
are
left
to
determine
how
the
electors
for
those
federal
officers
will
be
selected.
and
there
is
no
adopting
provision
which
brings
them
back
as
qualifications
for
voting
under
the
constitution
or
anything
of
that
sort.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
so
as
the
brief
for
the
united
states
concedes
in
this
case,
it
was
improper
for
the
court
below
to
have
extended
its
order
to
presidential
elections
in
this
way.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
we
were
given
15
additional
minutes
to
answer
the
government
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
court
please-
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon,
45
minutes.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
you
must
excuse
me,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
i'm
very
sorry.
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
i
thought
i
have
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
first
of
all
let
me
point
out
one
misquotation
which
was
made
by
counsel
for
the
appellees
and
i'm
sure
unintentionally
in
the
heat
of
the
questioning
he
said
in
showing
how
unreasonable
the
certificate
was
that
it
had
to
be
verified
by
two
witnesses.
on
page
10
of
the
record
in
subparagraph
b
of
this
section
before
you,
it
says
it
would
be
notarized
or
witnessed
by
at
least
one
adult.
so
one
witness
only
is
required.
now,
as
to
the
equal
protection
argument
that's
been
made
here,
i
challenge
anyone
to
look
at
the
statute
in
question
and
tell
that
it
classified
federal
voters
and
state
voters
in
terms
it
speaks
of
every
person,
any
person.
so
it
does
not
make
the
classification.
now
we
did
say
in
our
reply
brief
that
even
conceding
that
it
made
a
classification
of
federal
voters,
that
classification
would
be
invalid
under
the
rule
of
pope
versus
williams,
a
maryland
case
which
was
cited
and
relied
on
very
heavily
by
this
court
only
yesterday
in
the
case
of
carrington
versus
rash.
and
we
believe
that
under
the
language
of
both
of
those
cases,
this
particular
provision
of
virginia
code
would
be
valid
as
a
classification
even
if
it
did
--
even
if
it
were
limited
to
federal
voters
only
which
is
not
--
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
that
is
quite
correct
and
many
of
the
enactments
of
the
general
assembly
in
1963
were
classificate
--
bringing
into
law
the
classifications
of
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
made.
now,
in
answer
to
the
contention
made
by
the
government,
the
questions
of
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
white
got
right
at
the
heart
of
their
contention
because
if
you
read
their
brief,
you
will
see
that
what
they
are
saying
is
that
anything
which
is
burdensome,
onerous,
harsh,
oppressive,
and
which
would
force
you
to
pay
the
poll
tax
would
be
invalid
under
the
twenty-fourth
amendment.
we
would
concede
that
if
it
had
the
effect
of
forcing
you
to
pay
the
poll
tax
and
was
so
unreasonable
and
so
arbitrary
that
it
did
that
then
it
would
be
invalid
under
that
amendment
but
here
--
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
even
conceding
that,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
it
is
not
true
in
this
case
that
the
requirement
is
reasonable
and
not
at
all
burdensome.
now
pushing
the
government's
argument
to
its
fullest
extent,
let
us
supposed
that
virginia
did
a
way
with
the
poll
tax
and
in
place
of
it
adopted
an
annual
registration
system
which
many
states
have.
and
let's
say
that
they
declared
in
making
that
constitutional
amendment
that
they
were
doing
it
as
a
substitute
for
the
poll
tax.
now
would
that
be
invalid?
we
contend
that
it
clearly
would
not
be
and
that
the
government's
argument
falls
apart
completely
and
when
it's
viewed
in
that
light.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
say
just
a
word
about
the
abridgement
argument
which
was
brought
up
here.
it's
our
contention
that
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
this
particular
amendment,
you
will
see
that
it
was
a
specific
and
pinpointed
as
any
amendment
to
this
constitution
has
ever
been.
senator
harlan
introduced
the
resolution
in
about
five
sessions
of
congress
and
he
spoke
at
--
on
it
at
every
bar
association
and
other
meeting
he
held
during
that
period
of
time.
and
he
said
repeatedly
that
the
only
objective
was
to
do
a
way
with
the
price
on
the
vote.
and
that
he
did
not
intend
his
resolution
to
upset
the
state
election
machinery
anymore
than
that.
so
we
contend
that
the
word
abridged
in
this
context
and
with
this
legislative
history
means
to
deprive
or
to
cut
off
or
to
curtail
by
doing
something
else
that
is
so
harsh
and
so
oppressive
that
it
has
the
tendency
to
make
people
pay
the
poll
tax
and
thereby
violates
the
amendment.
in
no
--
mr.
joseph
c.
carter,
jr.
if
your
honor
please
i
should
have
gotten
to
that
at
the
outset
because
i
believe
the
court
has
been
mislead
in
this
respect
in
trying
to
answer
these
questions.
all
of
us
have
speculated
as
if
this
law
had
been
in
effect
for
sometime
and
then
we
did
have
some
practical
experience
under
it.
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
it
was
in
effect
for
only
two
months.
it
was
declared
invalid
before
you
had
any
real
experience
and
it
was
not
in
effect
in
any
elections
during
1964.
we
believe
that
the
government's
argument
on
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
is
so
broad
that
its
--
averts
the
intent
of
the
framers
of
that
amendment
and
constitutes
an
undue
interference
with
the
power
of
the
states
over
voting
qualifications.
