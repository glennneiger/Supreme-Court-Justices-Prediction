mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
don't
want
to
be
taken
as
conceding
that
if
the
united
states
has
conceded
we
don't
want
to
be
taken
as
conceding
if
this
--
or
the
court
was
improper
concerning
the
presidential
electors.
i
don't
think
the
united
states
has
conceded
it
either
but
if
the
court
think
so
we
don't
want
to
be
a
party
to
the
concession.
the
--
i
think
i
might
start
out
with
the
question
asked
by
justice
black
about
this
extremist
business.
this
is
what
senator
glass
said
in
the
convention,
discrimination,
well
that
is
exactly
what
we
proposed,
exactly
what
this
convention
was
elected
for,
to
discriminate
to
the
very
extremity
of
permissible
action
under
the
limitations
of
federal
constitution.
but
the
fact
is,
that
senator
glass
was
not
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
no
sir,
he
was
talking
about
the
purpose
of
the
suffrage
provisions
in
our
constitution
of
1902.
but
the
fact
is
that
senator
glass
was
not
the
extreme
--
didn't
represent
the
extreme
view
in
that
convention.
he
represented
the
middle
between
the
eastern
and
western
virginia.
many
people
in
the
convention
from
western
virginia
probably
most
of
them
were
against
any
poll
tax
at
all.
the
people
from
eastern
virginia
by
and
large
eastern
blue
ridge
mountains
were
far
more
stringent
restrictions
on
voting
than
this
constitution
provided.
and
the
statement
was
made
by
senator
glass
that
the
constitutional
convention
would
discriminate
but
only
to
the
extent
which
was
permissible
under
the
federal
constitution.
and
i
think
a
reading
of
the
debates
makes
that
quite
clear
that
he
was
the
person
of
the
convention
who
got
to
people
together.
the
poll
tax
was
put
in
that
convention
purely
and
simply
as
a
qualification
for
voting.
there
was
no
--
there's
no
mention
in
the
debates
the
convention
was
fully
reported
and
the
reports
are
widespread,
i
guess
almost
every
laws
of
virginia
has
one.
there
was
no
mention
with
the
debates
anywhere
at
all
of
poll
tax
being
any
kind
of
a
proof
of
residence.
the
constitutional
convention
established
four
qualifications
for
voting;
age,
residence,
registration,
and
poll
tax.
it
was
residence
and
poll
tax,
not
residence
or
poll
tax.
the
attorney
general,
when
the
legislature
met
the
special
session
to
pass
this
legislation
stated
that
the
right
of
the
state
to
fix
qualifications
for
voting
is
not
changed
in
any
other
respect.
the
attorney
general
stated
again,
this
appears
in
80
--
pages
84
and
86
of
the
record,
state
voters
will
automatically
qualify
to
vote
in
federal
elections
but
federal
voters
will
not
automatically
qualify
to
vote
in
state
elections.
so
what
this
special
session
met
for
and
passed
were
concerned
qualifications
for
voting
granted
that
the
statute
itself
after
he
get
started
goes
off
on
what
is
called
evidence
of
residence
now.
it
wasn't
called
hat
then.
in
the
preambles
of
the
statute
itself
at
page
92
of
the
record,
it's
a
bill
to
authorize
persons
in
anticipation
of
ratification
of
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
file
certificates
of
continuing
residence
so
as
to
be
able
to
vote
if
otherwise
qualified.
at
the
very
outset
of
all
of
these
legislations,
the
legislature
has
stated
that
in
filing
this
certificate
is
a
qualification
for
voting.
the
argument
that
it
was
a
proof
of
residence
came
later
in
the
statute.
apparently
the
general
assembly
must
have
been
worried
about
the
classification
or
establishing
different
qualifications
for
voters
from
the
house
of
delegates
and
for
congress
and
the
senate.
but
in
any
event,
that's
what
they
called
it
in
the
statute.
the
governor
in
his
address
to
the
general
assembly,
stated
that
the
--
they
were
not
fooling
around
with
the
qualifications
for
voting
but
that
they
were
only
legislating
with
regard
to
proof
of
residence.
and
the
governor
laid
it
back
to
the
constitutional
convention.
he
said
accordingly
and
out
of
the
genius
of
that
body
of
men
originated
our
present
system
whereby
it
is
presumed
that
any
person
assessed
for
the
computation
tax
and
thereby
allege
to
be
a
resident
of
virginia
who
comes
forward
and
voluntarily
pays
the
assessments
six
months
prior
to
a
general
election
shall
be
presumed
to
be
a
resident
of
virginia
and
shall
be
deemed
to
have
satisfied
those
provisions
of
the
constitution
which
restrict
voting
to
residents.
but
that
isn't
what
the
constitutional
convention
debate
said.
there
was
no
mention
in
it
--
of
it.
there
just
wasn't
any
mention
in
the
debates
of
such
a
thing.
i
like
to
invite
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
defendant's
exhibit
number
32
which
is
a
compilation
of
virginia
election
laws
put
out
by
the
state
and
in
the
back
of
the
exhibit
are
the
laws
passed
to
the
special
sessions.
now
the
laws
in
the
balance
of
the
book,
the
principal
part
of
the
book,
have
not
changed
it
substantially
since
1902.
these
were
the
laws
which
were
brought
about
by
our
constitutional
convention
of
1902.
it's
true
that
absent
voting
and
voting
by
members
of
the
armed
services
on
a
different
way
have
been
added
since
then
but
there's
been
no
substantial
change.
there
isn't
a
mention
in
the
principal
part
of
this
book
up
until
the
fall
of
1963
of
the
payment
of
the
poll
tax
being
evidence
of
anything,
residence,
or
otherwise.
the
payment
of
it
was
put
in
there
simply
to
restrict
the
electorate.
if
it
wasn't,
why
are
three-years
payment
of
poll
tax
required
to
prove
one
year's
residence?
why
is
payment
of
1963
tax
required
to
vote
in
1964?
the
1963
poll
tax
for
example
is
assessed
on
january
the
1st,
1963.
it
is
payable
on
this
--
until
december
the
5th,
1963
without
a
penalty.
i
think
that
time
there's
a
penalty
in
interest
charge
on
it.
but
if
you
pay
it
up
until
may
of
1964,
you
can
vote
in
the
general
election
which
takes
place
in
november
1964.
but
how
does
the
payment
of
the
poll
tax
in
may
prove
that
you're
a
resident
in
november?
or
out
of
the
payment
for
poll
tax
for
1963,
supposed
you
paid
on
time,
proves
that
you're
going
to
be
a
resident
of
virginia
at
all
for
1964?
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
by
registration
sir.
the
registration
forms
are
very
detailed
and
complete
requiring
just
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
no
sir,
you
only
register
one
time
in
virginia.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
no
sir.
the
--
we
have
to
challenge.
anyone
can
be
challenged.
there's
a
--
being
a
nonresident
at
the
polls
when
he
offers
to
vote.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
well,
they
post
them
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
they
only
post
the
poll
tax
list.
no
sir.
there
is
no
requirement
to
post
a
registration
list.
the
registration
books
are
kept
by
a
registrar
in
every
precinct
in
the
state.
in
some
places,
we
have
central
registrars
for
a
whole
county
or
city.
the
books
are
kept
in
the
hands
of
the
registrar.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
i
don't
say
it
is
not
any
evidence
of
residence.
i
say
that
isn't
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
don't
say
it's
a
proof
of
residence,
it
is
evidence
of
residence.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
the
payment
of
any
tax
is
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
that's
right
sir.
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
say
it
some
evidence
of
residence,
payment
of
a
personal
property
tax
is
where
a
man's
family
is,
where
his
domicile
is,
where
his
actual
physical
abode
is.
all
of
these
things
are
evidence
of
residence.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
i
don't
see
why
they
couldn't
require
it
sir
but
i
don't
think
they
could
acquire
a
different
evidence
of
residency
in
state
and
federal
elections.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
no
sir.
i
wouldn't
think
that
he
could
once
he
paid
the
tax.
i
never
have
heard
of
anyone
trying
it
sir.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
the
--
there's
a
provision
for
purging
the
registration
book,
sir.
the
registrar
actually
takes
them
off
himself.
there
are
other
provisions
for
purging
by
other
registered
voters.
they
can
come
forward
and
say
that
the
jones
and
smith
and
brown
have
died
or
moved
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
and
the
registrar
then
gives
notice
to
the
people
and
if
they
don't
appear
he
takes
them
off
the
books.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
in
my
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
in
my
own
community
it
is,
yes
sir.
the
registrar
keeps
our
books
in
very
good
shape.
i
can't
speak
for
other
places.
i
would
guess
that
possibly
in
the
small
country
precincts
from
--
maybe
that's
better.
they
know
people
more.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
but
i
think
probably
they're
kept
it
in
fairly
good
shape.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
yes
sir,
we're
allowed
to
have
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
--
poll
watchers
at
the
polls.
each
candidate
has
poll
watchers
at
the
counting
and
any
qualified
voter
can
challenge
another
person
when
he
offers
to
vote.
when
you
come
in
virginia
and
ask
for
a
ballot
or
say
my
name
is
smith,
am
i
on
the
list?
that
is
an
offer
to
vote
in
virginia.
and
at
that
time
he
can
be
challenged.
the
--
both
the
majority
party
and
the
minority
party
are
represented
at
the
polls.
the
people
who
got
the
majority
in
the
last
general
state
election
have
the
majority
of
two
judges.
the
minority
party
has
one
judge.
i
don't
know
about
the
practice
for
clerks
of
election
in
other
places.
in
my
hometown
we
have
one
clerk
and
they
have
one
clerk.
so
that
this
--
as
far
as
i
know,
there's
adequate
safeguards
at
the
polls
for
challenging
people.
if
you
--
a
challenge
comes
out
at
the
polls
for
a
voter
there's
a
note
which
the
judges
of
election
must
administer
to
the
voter
and
perhaps
this
answers
to
justice
white's
question
to
some
extent.
there's
an
oath
which
the
judges
of
election
administer
to
the
voter
before
he
is
allowed
to
vote.
if
smith
comes
up
and
says,
"i
want
my
ballot"
and
the
--
one
of
the
judges
says,
"i
challenged
smith
on
the
grounds
he's
a
nonresident",
the
challenge
sticks
at
that
time
until
there's
a
long
statutory
oath
and
they
are
also
allowed
to
examine
him.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
no
sir,
that's
right.
you
walk
in,
give
them
your
name,
they
check
you
up
on
the
registration
books
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
yes
sir,
the
poll
tax
--
the
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
well,
sir
if
the
–
i
think
that
the
state
–
if
the
state
would
require
voters
in
state
elections
to
file
the
same
certificate
i
wouldn't
be
up
here.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
and
required
it
to
be
signed
before
they
could
vote.
if
the
state
required
the
state
voter
to
sign
the
same
certificate,
no
sir
i
would
not
be
here.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
well,
i
would
then
complain
that
they
didn't
send
it
to
everyone
on
the
registration
books.
there
was
a
question
asked
a
few
minutes
ago
about
how
is
it
mailed
out.
they
mailed
it
out
to
the
people
who
paid
the
personal
property
tax
the
year
before.
this
certificates
though
if
--
if
a
state
were
to
adopt
that
system
ought
to
be
mailed
to
all
of
the
voters
not
to
all
of
the
taxpayers.
the
fact
that
whether
a
man
who
owns
the
personal
property
tax
list
or
not
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
he
is
a
voter
or
not.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
yes
sir,
they
are
their
blank
forms
they
are
part
of
the
record
in
these
proceedings.
so
you
must
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
yes
sir,
that's
true.
then
you
must
go
down
and
get
this
certificate
of
residence,
have
it
witnessed
or
notarized,
say
that
you
will
not
leave
the
state
until
the
election.
none
of
those
things
the
poll
taxpayer
has
to
do
in
addition
to
the
actual
filing
of
the
certificate.
the
poll
tax
payments,
the
dollar
and
a
half
was
mentioned,
that
isn't
nearly
important
as
to
the
fact
that
you
have
to
pay
it
for
three
years.
the
$5
could
make
a
difference
to
some
voters.
the
fact
that
it
must
be
paid
in
may
to
vote
in
november
is
the
thing
that
makes
the
big
difference
about
the
poll
tax.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
you
walk
over
the
treasurer's
office
and
pay
it
and
get
a
receipt,
sir.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
no
sir.
you
could
not
pay
it
then.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
no
sir.
and
if
you
were
on
this
list
you
couldn't
vote
even
though
you
have
the
receipts
as
a
matter
of
fact.
they
make
up
the
poll
tax
list
and
there's
provision
made.
the
treasurer
posts
it
down
the
courthouse.
you
then
are
supposed
to
go
and
check
the
list
yourself
to
see
if
you're
on
it.
if
you
aren't
on
it
there's
a
provision
for
getting
yourself
put
back
on
it.
and
if
you
don't
do
that
actually
the
poll
tax
receipt
is
not
any
good
at
the
polls.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
that's
right
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
no
sir.
oh,
you
have
to
be
registered
even
if
you
pay
the
tax,
yes
sir
that's
correct.
but
you
don't
have
to
have
registered
to
pay
the
tax.
you
cannot
register
to
vote
in
virginia
though
at
--
on
state
elections
in
any
event
unless
you
have
previously
paid
your
poll
tax.
it
is
a
qualification
both
for
registration
and
for
voting.
a
voter
who
is
coming
21
gets
--
can
register
without
payment
of
the
tax
and
gets
his
first
vote
free.
the
same
thing
applies
to
new
residents
who
moves
into
the
state.
he
can
register
without
paying
the
tax
because
it's
assessable
on
january
1st.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
under
this
--
well
now,
it
depends
on
which
bunch
you're
in
sir,
a
federal
voter
or
a
voter
in
all
elections.
they
have
separated
them
now.
it
used
to
be
--
we
had
one
set
of
registration
books.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
now
we
have
two,
yes
sir.
now
for
federal
elections,
you
go
down
to
the
registrars
office
on
this
federal
election
book
and
you
fill
out
a
certificate
which
is
our
form
which
is
almost
exactly
the
same.
the
form
actually
is
in
the
records,
it's
a
blank
piece
of
paper.
and
you
have
state
your
--
guess
what
you
must
state
on
there,
your
name,
age,
residence,
i
think
the
names
of
your
parents,
how
long
you've
lived
in
the
state
and
where
did
you
last
vote
and
possibly
some
other
information,
it's
very
complete.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
for
federal
elections
only
sir.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
yes
sir.
yes
sir
it's
a
different
book
just
exactly
like
the
book
for
all
elections.
they
have
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
yes
sir
that's
correct.
the
first
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
yes
sir.
he
has
to
come
back
and
file
a
certificate
each
year.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
no
sir,
he
doesn't.
thereafter,
he
has
to
file
the
certificate.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
he
would
have
to
pay
his
poll
tax
or
file
a
certificate
each
year
though.
one
or
the
other
is
required
each
year.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
i
don't
know
if
any
provision
for
distributing
them
to
the
public.
i
can
tell
you
the
practical
matter
in
my
hometown.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
i
don't
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
i
don't
think
there's
any
requirement
of
it
at
all
in
the
law.
i
don't
think
their
state
or
the
state
officials,
the
registrars,
accounting
treasurers,
and
so
forth,
are
not
required
to
do
anything.
the
voter
is
supposed
to
know
to
come
in
and
get
his
form.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
yes
sir.
it's
just
about
the
same.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
and
if
the
state
hadn't
--
had
said
that
the
--
everybody
that
votes
on
every
election
must
file
this
certificate.
i
don't
know
if
any
--
more
of
a
classification
or
anything
wrong
we've
done.
if
they
said
the
filing
of
the
certificate
would
entitle
us
to
vote
in
state
elections
which
could
be
read
into
the
state's
brief
that
they
filed
in
this
case,
they
say
there's
--
it's
equally
applicable.
if
either
system
were
adopted
but
we
maintained
they
have
--
don't
have
the
right
to
make
a
classification
of
a
state
voter
or
a
federal
voter
who
has
not
paid
his
poll
tax.
and
that's
what
they
called
the
classification
that
they
made
in
the
conclusion
of
their
reply
brief.
this
is
--
now,
on
page
16
they
say
virginia
should
be
upheld
even
if
it
had
enacted
a
statute
affecting
only
a
class
and
this
is
the
name
of
the
class
(federal
voters
who
have
not
paid
their
poll
taxes).
now
that
--
that's
the
classification
that
they
are
--
they're
legislating
about
and
we
say
that
they
don't
have
any
right
to
legislate
about
it.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
that's
on
page
16
of
the
appellant's
reply
brief,
sir.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
no
sir,
not
entirely.
we
also
say
it's
a
violation
of
article
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
not
the
poll
tax
across
the
board,
sir.
the
requirement
of
the
certificate
is
across
the
board.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
yes
sir.
well,
the
district
court
has
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
i'm
arguing
on
article
i,
section
2
in
the
seventeenth
amendment,
sir.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
well,
yes
sir,
up
to
date
it
has.
the
district
court
has
held
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
filing
of
these
certificates
is
a
qualification
to
vote.
we
maintained
that
the
district
court
is
right.
now,
the
--
just
--
or
if
for
no
other
reason
and
there
are
lots
of
reasons,
the
statute
itself
says
it's
a
qualification
to
vote.
the
attorney
general
has
said
in
two
places
in
the
state
to
general
assembly
that
they
were
passing
legislation
concerning
qualifications
to
vote.
now,
the
article
i,
section
2
and
amendment
17
provide
that
the
qualifications
cannot
be
different
for
members
of
the
house
of
delegates
and
for
people
voting
for
congress
and
the
senate.
but
we
have
different
qualifications
here.
this
certificate
is
required
of
federal
voters
and
this
certificate
does
not
entitle
according
to
the
state
law
as
the
state
construes
it,
this
voter
to
vote
in
an
election
for
the
house
of
delegates.
that
voter
is
required
to
pay
a
poll
tax.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
the
government
has
said
--
of
the
united
states
that
it
is
an
abridgement
of
the
rights
given
by
the
twenty-fourth
amendment.
and
on
page
10
of
the
government's
brief,
they
say
it
remains
only
to
show
that
the
virginia
statute
in
suit,
in
fact,
in
process,
onerous
procedural
requirements.
the
state
has
taken
the
view
that
the
government
says
that
the
state
can't
--
thereafter
legislate
concerning
any
uniform
requirement.
the
difficulty
we
see
to
the
government's
view
under
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
is
this.
that
if
we
get
into
the
degree
of
requirements
that
is
allowed
or
what
is
allowed
is
--
how
much
is
allowed
to
form
--
we
will
end
up
with
these
cases
as
a
matter
of
fact.
for
example,
they're
required
two
witnesses
if
they
can
require
two,
can't
--
they
require
ten.
we
don't
think
there's
any
use
to
get
to
the
argument
of
whether
this
requirement
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable,
we
say
they
don't
have
any
right
to
do
it.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
alright
sir,
the--
as
i
understand
it,
at
least
our
court
has
said
in
willis
against
commack
(ph),
its
page
43,
it's
judge
keith.
he
says,
“the
object
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
to
secure
the
right
to
vote
at
any
election
for
the
choice
of
electors
for
president
and
vice
president
of
the
u.s.,
representatives
in
congress,
the
executive
and
judicial
officers
of
the
state
or
the
members
of
the
legislature
thereof.”
and
i
think
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
have
application
to
this
right
because
this
is
not
an
exclusively
state
right
establishing
qualifications
for
voting.
the
state's
brief
has
argued
at
great
length
that
the
establishment
of
qualification
is
the
--
in
exclusive
right
of
the
state.
on
page
8
of
the
brief,
their
opening
brief,
they
state
that
the
states
have
the
exclusive
power
to
create
qualifications
for
voting
in
all
elections
and
that
word
exclusive
or
words
of
similar
import
are
used
a
great
number
of
times
throughout
their
brief.
the
--
we
don't
believe
that
the
history
of
the
voting
legislation
in
general
bears
that
out.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
alright
sir,
we
say
that
the
right
of
--
for
voting
in
federal
elections
as
is
a
federally
protected
right,
the
yarborough
cases
held
that.
that
--
although
that
our
case
concerned
this
--
of
the
house
i
think
or
something
like
that.
that
it
is
a
federally
protected
right.
that
they
have
made
an
unwarranted
classification,
they
have
legislated
for
federal
voters
only.
we
don't
think
that
they
have
any
right
to
do
it.
the
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
yes
sir,
that's
right.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
and
we
say
that
they
have
established
a
classification.
the
--
on
page
95
of
the
record,
this
is
the
beginning
line
of
one
of
the
sections,
section
17.1,
persons
entitled
to
vote
only
at
elections
for
certain
federal
officers.
we
say
that
that
the
classification
itself
is
not
warranted.
that
they
cannot
legislate
with
regard
to
that
that
they
just
--
they
just
can't
do
it.
it's
not
the
question
of
whether
it's
a
reasonable
or
unreasonable
that
they
have
no
right
to
put
people
in
that
class.
then
they
have
gone
on
and
in
addition
to
that,
the
district
court
has
pointed
out
in
its
opinion
in
great
length
the
differences
between
people
who
pay
poll
tax
and
filed
a
certificate
of
it
and
that
--
about
paying
the
poll
tax
or
filing
a
certificate
is
a
burden
on
the
federal
elector
which
is
not
required
of
the
state
elector.
and
i
don't
think
that
we're
entitled
to
measure
the
degree
of
the
burden.
if
there's
any
burden
on
this
federal
elector
or
does
not
require
for
the
state
elector,
we
maintain
its
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
i
would
--
i
would
rather
go
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
--
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
than
to
the
twenty-fourth
to
get
to
it,
yes
sir.
because
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
if
they
make
any
requirement
of
the
federal
voter
and
legislate
with
regard
to
him
that
it's
not
required
of
the
state
voter
that
they
have
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment.
they
have
by
statute
created
a
class.
they
have
repeated
that
in
their
brief
and
now
named
it
as
class.
the
federal
voter
who's
not
paid
his
poll
tax
must
do
a
and
b
and
c.
we
say
they
have
no
right
to
do
it.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
we
would
say
that
the
twenty-fourth
amendment,
sir,
creates
a
prohibition
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
--
what
they
can't
require
rather
than
what
they
can
--
sir?
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
is
a
prohibition.
it
just
erased
the
poll
tax.
we're
then
creating
a
class.
there
is
a
good
bit
of
argument
in
the
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
no
sir,
i
think
that
some
of
the
certificates
were
filed.
i
know
there
were
some
who
were
filed.
how
many?
i'm
just
not
able
to
say
it.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
in
my
own
mind
it
is,
yes
sir.
i'd
much
rather
stick
a
check
for
a
dollar
and
a
half
in
the
mail
than
have
to
go
down
to
the
treasurer's
office,
get
a
certificate,
take
it
out,
fill
it
in,
find
a
witness,
get
it
back
to
the
treasurer
or
else
pay
a
notary
fee.
perhaps
there
are
no
notary
fees
in
richmond.
there
certain
are
(inaudible).
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
i
think
it
would
depend
entirely
on
whether
the
registrar
or
the
treasurer
whoever
gave
it
wants
a
notary
and
wanted
to
take
your
acknowledgement,
you
wouldn't
have
to
if
he
didn't
want
to.
there's
no
requirement
of
the
law
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
you
have
--
either
have
to
have
two
witnesses
or
a
notary.
and
are
--
one
thing
we
say
is,
if
you
can
have
two
witnesses,
why
can't
you
have
ten
witnesses?
why
can't
--
they're
required
a
dozen?
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
yes
sir.
but
they
have
required
two
witnesses
or
a
notary.
they
--
you
can
do
either
one.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
i
could,
yes
sir.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
yes
sir,
that's
right.
but
whether
--
what
--
they
have
to
have
two
witnesses,
sir.
they
--
the
--
or
one
witness
would
not
suffice.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
i
would
say
that
it
would
sir.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
i
would
say
that
it
would
sir.
i
would
rather
pay
him
the
tax,
i
do
that.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
yes
sir,
you
could
do
that.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
because
we
say
that
that
you
will
get
into
--
getting
to
the
reasonable
--
that
whether
or
not
a
restriction
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
what
--
no
sir,
that
argument
that
--
just
as
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
the
one
that
you've
stated
sir,
i
would
embrace
but
i
do
not
embrace
the
fact
of
whether
or
not
the
burden
that
is
put
on
this
voter
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable.
i
do
not
--
i
don't
think
they
have
a
right
to
put
any
burden
on
him
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
--
under
the
fourteenth
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
yes
sir.
apparently
they
are.
that's
why
i
say
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
we
say
they
didn't
have
any
right
to
legislate
concerning
it
sir.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
no
sir,
i
wouldn't.
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
i
do
say
that
they
haven't
a
right
to
put
them
in
a
separate
category
and
then
provide
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
if
everybody
else
had
to
file
a
white
one,
that's
alright
sir.
but
i
don't
think
that
you
could
put
them
in
a
category
and
file
a
pink
slip
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
well
we
say
that
there
--
if
it's
a
--
in
any
difference
in
the
qualifications,
i
don't
think
pink
and
white
would
be
a
different
qualification,
sir.
the
filing
or
not
filing,
i
do
think
it's
different.
if
you
had
--
one
had
--
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
sir?
mr.
h.
e.
widener,
jr.
well
--
if
that's
the
way
the
court
puts
it
sir.
thank
you,
sir.
