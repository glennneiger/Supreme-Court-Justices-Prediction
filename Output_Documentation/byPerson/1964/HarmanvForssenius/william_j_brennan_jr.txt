j.
brennan,
jr.
that
being
it's
a
lien
against
one
little
state,
that's
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
you
have
--
you
have
to
be
registered
even
though
you
paid
the
poll
tax
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
(inaudible)
under
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
will
you
if
you
accept
the
--
as
i
understand
the
government's
proposition
that
this
requirement
is
something
in
lieu
of
the
poll
tax
and
therefore
the
equivalent
of
the
poll
tax
it
therefore
violates
the
twenty-fourth

argument
gets
you

william
j.
brennan,
jr.

making
the
argument
that
this
is
burdensome?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see.
is
it
your
position
that
this
is
nothing
for
the
device
to
do
the
same
thing
that
the
outlawed
poll
tax
did?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
be
if
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
i
must
say
--
well,
go
on.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
mr.
greene
after
all
that
--
after
all
the
--
the
amendment
abolished
the
poll
tax
for
a
reason,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright,
for
several
reasons.
now
if
these
requirements
serve
those
same
reasons,
why
--
isn't
that
within
the
band
of
the
twenty-fourth
amendment?
