mr.
harold
h.
greene
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
we
submit
that
the
virginia
laws
are
invalid
under
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
itself.
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
provides
the
right
to
vote
in
certain
federal
elections,
shall
not
be
denied
or
abridged
upon
the
kind
of
failure
to
pay
poll
tax.
we
believe
there
was
an
abridgement
here
because
the
legislation
imposes
a
burden
on
persons
who
have
not
paid
the
poll
tax
solely
because
they
have
not
paid
the
poll
tax,
because
that
burden
is
an
unnecessary
and
unreasonable
burden
and
because
it
is
precisely
a
burden
of
the
type
which
was
meant
to
be
reached
by
the
twenty-fourth
amendment.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
not
precisely.
if
it
were
--
if
--
to
argue
that
would
only
be
a
device
to
reach
the
same
result
as
the
poll
tax,
you
might
have
to
go
into
purpose
or
motive
and
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
in
this
case
to
do
that.
it
has
a
bearing.
the
fact
that
the
type
of
device
that's
attached
to
this
procedure
is
similar
to
the
cumbersomeness
in
the
type
of
rejections
that
were
made
to
the
poll
tax,
has
a
bearing
on
the
results
on
whether
this
is
or
is
not
an
abridgement
but
standing
by
itself.
i
don't
--
we
do
not
argue
that
that
alone
is
--
would
be
sufficient
or
would
cause
for
the
invalidity
of
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that
is
correct.
now,
we
say
further
that
if
--
it'd
be
assumed
that
virginia
argues
that
they
must
--
they
need
to
do
that
and
we
are
willing
to
concede
or
assume
for
purpose
of
this
case
that
if
a
case
of
absolute
necessity
were
made
out
by
the
state
that
there's
no
other
way
in
which
they
can
achieve
the
legitimate
governmental
objective,
namely
the
checking
on
residence.
and
if
the
means
are
adopted
to
accomplish
that
objective
were
the
most
reasonable
and
the
least
cumbersome
possible,
perhaps
this
type
of
device
would
then
be
appropriate.
the
court
need
not
reach
the
question
in
this
case
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
--
were
there
any
device?
mr.
harold
h.
greene
yes
sir.
well
it
--
and
also
in
the
sense
that
it
is
a
practical
burden
as
i
will
try
to
show,
it
is
a
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
whether
if
i'm
--
if
i
may
proceed,
the
concept
of
abridgment
as
has
been
used
and
understood
in
connection
with
the
fifteenth
and
nineteenth
amendments
is
that
if
any
burden,
any
requirement
is
placed
upon
a
person
because
of
his
race
or
sex
in
connection
with
voting,
that
would
be
an
abridgement
of
the
fifteenth
and
the
nineteenth
amendments.
in
the
same
way
here
under
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
where
a
requirement,
a
burden
is
placed
on
the
person
solely
because
he
avails
himself
on
his
right
under
the
twenty-fourth
amendment,
not
to
pay
a
poll
tax
that
would
be
a
burden
in
the
three-judge
court
in
the
equivalent
mississippi
case,
gray
against
johnson
held
just
that.
now,
the
state
comes
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
now,
this
is,
as
i
understand
it
that
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
this
would
be
required
only
of
a
person
who
had
not
paid
his
poll
tax.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
no,
i
--
that's
why
in
answer
to
the
previous
question,
i
said
this
would
be
a
much
harder
case.
it
might
well
be.
we
think
it
might
well
be
as
that
too
would
be
invalid.
but
the
court
need
not
concern
itself
in
this
case
with
that
example
because
here
we
have
the
type
of
burden
which
is
very
cumbersome
and
which
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
it
is
a
burden
which
is
most
severe
or
at
least
as
severe
as
the
payment
as
the
poll
tax.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
it
is
the
burden
of
the
type
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that's
right.
it
is
a
burden
of
the
type
which
the
framers
of
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
had
in
mind
and
i
might
say
this,
the
burden
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that
it
is
a
burden?
well,
the
mechanics
for
obtaining
this
residence
certificates
are
as
follows.
first
of
all,
it
must
be
filed
in
every
election
in
connection
with
every
election
it's
not
from
that
type
of
thing.
it
must
be
filed
within
the
specified
time
between
october
first
of
the
year
proceeding
the
election
and
six
months
before
the
election
with
--
would
work
out
in
may
of
the
year
of
the
election.
apparently
as
i
read
the
record,
if
the
certificate
is
received
subsequent
to
may,
it
will
not
be
considered
at
all,
the
registrar
would
simply
--
the
treasurer
will
simply
give
it
no
validity
whatever.
so
it
must
be
filed
within
a
specified
very
definitely
limited
specified
period
of
time.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
no
sir.
the
poll
tax
is
mailed
out
to
the
voter.
he
doesn't
have
to
get
--
go
out
and
get
it.
now,
of
course
the
state
says
and
the
certificate
can
be
typed
out
or
written
out
by
the
applicant
himself
and
i
don't
think
that's
a
greatly
--
significantly
different
burden
in
obtaining
this
certificate
if
you
have
to
type
it
out
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
the
poll
tax
has
to
have
been
paid
by
may,
but
it
may
be
mailed
it
anytime.
you
can't
vote
if
you
haven't
paid
it
by
may
but
you
can
mail
it
at
anytime.
you
receive
the
bill
at
your
home
and
then
at
anytime
after
you
received
the
bill,
you
mail
in
your
check
and
that's
all
you
have
to
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
you
can
do
it
by
mail,
yes
sir.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
you
have
to
do
it
by
may
to
vote
in
that
election.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that's
correct.
but
here,
you
have
to
pick
up
the
certificate
or
make
it
out
yourself
at
one
office.
you
have
to
fill
it
out
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
i
wouldn't
say
that
wouldn't
have
any
problem
because
you
might
still
then
have
to
determine
the
question
were
there
any
kind
of
requirement
imposed
on
a
non-poll
tax
payer
solely
because
he's
a
non-poll
tax
payer
is
valid
under
the
twenty-fourth
amendment.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
for
several
reasons.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
it
might
be.
of
course
that
would
reach
also
the
--
that
would
--
that
is
true
if
it
weren't
solely
for
that
reason.
but
of
course
the
poll
tax
was
abolished.
i
couldn't
tell
the
court
that
the
poll
tax
was
abolished
solely
for
the
reason
that
it
was
a
cumbersome
requirement.
it
was
also
abolished
for
the
--
because
of
the
fact
that
it
involved
the
expenditure
of
money
which
was
certainly
one
of
the
reasons
congress
had
in
mind.
now,
as
to
whether
which
of
those
ought
to
be
given
more
weight,
whether
the
fact
that
this
requirement
is
somewhat
in
the
same
area
would
be
sufficient
to
cause
invalidity
per
se
of
the
requirement,
i
--
is
again
a
question
which
--
as
i
say
is
a
harder
question
than
what
we
have
here.
here
we
happened
to
have
all
of
the
factors
present.
we
have
a
cumbersome
requirement.
we
have
one
that
is
imposed
on
people
solely
because
they
are
trying
to
avail
themselves
of
their
twenty-fourth
amendment
right.
and
we
have
a
requirement
which
is
very
analogous
to
at
least
some
of
the
objections
that
people
had
to
the
poll
tax.
so
that
on
that
aspect
of
it
that
would
be
the
narrowest
basis
on
which
this
case
could
be
desired.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that's
correct.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
we
of
course
challenged
that
the
state's
premises
in
this
regard
are
correct.
we
don't
believe
that
the
poll
tax
ever
was
a
--
an
evidentiary
requirement
or
that
it
has
ever
been
used
in
that
manner.
and
i
might
say
on
this
issue
at
least
insofar
as
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
is
concerned,
the
state
has
a
very
heavy
burden
because
they
are
putting
a
burden
on
the
exercise
of
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
right
and
they
have
the
job
of
justifying
that
this
is
a
reasonable
burden
and
they
can
--
if
they
cannot
justify
it
this
is
a
reasonable
burden
unless
they
can
show
that
the
poll
tax
in
fact
and
as
a
matter
of
legislative
intent
was
a
residence
requirement
which
i
think
it
was
not.
the
constitution
of
virginia
list
of
paying
a
poll
tax
in
residence
is
two
entirely
separate
qualifications
and
not
one
is
a
proof
of
the
other.
so
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
determine
(inaudible)
--
and
the
state
has
not
pointed
out
differently.
until
november
of
1963
no
one
has
ever
dreamed
that
the
poll
tax
was
a
requirement,
was
a
proof
of
residence,
it
was
always
something
else.
it
was
an
--
means
of
raising
revenue
or
as
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
has
pointed
out,
it
was
a
means
of
restricting
the
electorate
to
those
persons
who
are
sufficiently
interested
in
governmental
affairs
to
pay
their
poll
tax
at
an
early
time.
now
in
fact,
it
does
not
--
the
poll
tax
does
not
really
prove
residence.
it
--
the
check
on
residence
might
be
necessary
with
respect
to
two
classes
basically,
the
persons
who
are
coming
into
the
state
for
the
first
time
and
people
who
have
been
within
the
state,
have
registered,
have
voted,
and
that
since
moved
out
and
would
still
like
to
vote
again.
as
to
the
first
class,
people
who
have
never
been
then
tried
to
vote.
the
real
proof
of
residence,
the
real
check
on
residence
is
the
registration
requirements
because
that's
the
first
thing
you
have
to
do.
this
legislation
recognizes
that
registration
is
the
real
check
on
residence
as
to
those
people
because
you
do
not
have
to
obtain
the
certificate
in
the
year
in
which
you
register.
so
that
when
a
person
comes
in,
he
--
the
state
knows
that
he
is
a
resident
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
registered
permanently
at
that
time
and
he
can
be
examined
at
that
time
as
to
his
residence.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
can
he
be
required
to
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
he
can
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
--
be
required
to
register
--
everyone
is
required
to
register
on
--
at
one
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
yes,
yes
of
course.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
i
was
intending
--
i
--
if
i
didn't,
i
meant
to.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
i
meant
to.
if
i
didn't
i
meant
to
rely
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
--
on
the
abridgement
clause.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well
i
intended
to
state
that.
if
i
didn't
i'm
sorry.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that
is
right.
that
is
our
contention
that
the
right
to
vote
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
no.
well,
the
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
we're
only
talking
about
burdening
because
the
right
is
abridged
if
it
is
burdened
in
the
sense
that
the
requirements
are
placed
upon
it
then
you
have
an
abridgement.
if
the
abridgement
is
the
consequence
which
follows
from
the
burden
which
follows
from
the
additional
requirement
that's
put
on.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
that
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
i
think
that's
right.
you
--
if
--
it
is
perfectly
proper
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
that's
correct.
and
as
i
--
that's
quite
true
and
i
think
the
court
could
hold
and
it
could
be
argued
that
any
requirements
that's
placed
on
a
person
solely
because
he
has
not
paid
the
poll
tax
is
an
abridgment
and
i'm
not
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
i'm
not
particularly
disavowing
that
argument.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
it's
no
--
i've
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that's
right.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that's
right.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
justice
black,
the
state
could
do
the
same
thing
if
the
other
44
states
that
have
permanent
registration
are
doing
and
it
is
doing
what
the
other
44
states
are
doing,
to
check
on
residents.
they
have
a
challenged
provision
at
the
polls.
they
have
provisions
for
purging
those
who
are
no
longer
residents.
they
have
criminal
penalties
for
persons
who
vote
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
they
are
not
residents.
and
those
are
all
the
means
and
devices
which
other
states,
the
other
--
or
the
other
44
states
have
found
to
be
sufficient
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
nonresidents
and
none
of
these
states
has
found
it
necessary
to
add
in
addition
to
this
complicated,
cumbersome,
peculiar
residence
certificate
requirement.
so
that's
--
that
is
quite
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
then
--
well
i
think
they
could,
they
certainly
could.
and
they
should
and
that's
--
as
i
say
that's
all
that's
really
needed
so
far
as
residence
is
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
that's
right.
and
the
--
as
i
say
the
answer
is
number
one,
the
premise
that
the
poll
tax
was
used
for
that
isn't
true.
the
second
answer
is
that
they
have
sufficient
devices
now
to
deal
with
problem
of
voting
by
nonresidents.
and
therefore
this
peculiar
requirement
which
is
in
the
area
of
the
devices
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
is
wholly
unnecessary
and
can
really
have
no
other
purpose
except
to
perpetuate
the
difficulties
inherent
in
the
poll
tax.
mr.
harold
h.
greene
it
does
in
one
of
the
respect
that
the
poll
tax
dealt
--
mr.
harold
h.
greene
well,
it
may
well
be
enough.
i'm
not
arguing
that
it's
not
enough.
as
i
say
in
this
case
we
have
all
these
additional
factors
which
could
be
taken
into
account
to
strike
down
this
legislation.
