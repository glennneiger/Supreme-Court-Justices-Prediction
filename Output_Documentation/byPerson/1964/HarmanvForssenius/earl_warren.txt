et

mr.
carter,
you
may
proceed
and
continue
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
could
turn
a
million
dollars
a
year
over
to
the
school
systems,
how
can
you
say
it
is
the
revenue
made?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
question
that
was
asked
by
mr.
justice
white
doesn't
mean
or
your
answer
to
it
rather,
doesn't
mean
that
there
is
a
form
that
they
must
fill
out
in
paying
the
poll
tax
which
will
give
the
same
information,
is
that
--
the
certificate
does
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
they
do
is
send
the
bill
and
the
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
money
--
the
money
is
returned.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
say
that's
voluntary?
that's
new
to
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
doesn't
the
certificate
require
the
maker
to
say
that
he
intends
to
remain
a
resident
until
the
election?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
poll
tax
pair
have
to
make
any
such
certificate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
kind
of
a
--
does
he
make
any
certification
to
that
effect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
this
--
suppose
a
man
said
i
make
the
cert
--
i'll
make
the
certificate
out
and
i
cannot
--
i
don't
care
to
state
that
i
am
--
that
i
will
be
a
resident
at
the
time
of
the
election.
would
it
be
any
good?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
he
would
still
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
would
still
a
resident
but
maybe
he's
planned
for
uncertain
and
he
didn't
know
what
he
was
going
to
do
and
he
didn't
want
to
be
charged
with
any
offense
for
falsifying
certificates.
so
he
just
didn't
want
to
say
and
he
declined
to
answer
that
question,
would
a
certificate
be
any
good?
chief
justice
earl
warren
be
disqualified
but
anyone
who
--
anyone
who
pay
the
poll
tax
and
had
the
same
reservation
would
not
be
disqualified,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
isn't
that
a
qualification
for
voting
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
that's
true
even
though
it
would
slow
down
the
voting
rights
of
a
man
that
reaches
it
to
some
extent,
do
you
think
that's
within
the
power
of
the
legislature
under
the
twenty-fourth
amendment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
you
think
the
legislature
can
prescribe
a
number
of
tests
of
--
for
voting
that
are
different
among
different
groups?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
widener.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
a
man
who
signed
one
of
these
certificates
go
on
the
permanent
voting
role
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
it
is
a
permanent
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
what
i
meant.
he
has
to
file
that
every
year.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
he
wants
to
pay
as
to
poll
tax
and
he
gets
on
there,
how
about
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
would
these
--
how
are
these
forms
for
the
certificates
distributed
to
the
public?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
now
it's
given
to
the
prospective
voters
as
to
the
necessity
for
them
doing
this
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
where
they
may
get
the
forms.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
greene.

warren
number
123.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon,
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
had
taken
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
will
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
will
give
you
a
few
minutes
to
answer.
you
go
ahead
and
answer.
you
did
it
mistakenly
but
you
did
have
your
full
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
alright.
you
take
a
few
minutes
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
mr.
carter
to
answer
the
solicitor
general.
