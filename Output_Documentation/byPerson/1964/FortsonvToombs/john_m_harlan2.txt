to
vacate
that

[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
say
to
mr.
leverett's
argument
that
assuming
all
that
that
the
legislatures
hands
are
tied
because
of
the
opinion
that's
been
written
by
the
three-judge
court
or
that
you
--
he
maybe
faced
--
the
state
maybe
faced
with
another
suit
--
new
legislature
acts.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
your
clients
would
bring
another
suit
if
the
legislature
did
act?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you're
certainly
in
no
position
to
assure
the
state
that
you
wouldn't.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
while
it
maybe
speculative
you
just
say
it's
still
a
contingency
that
it
is
without
substance?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
divide
the
lines
of
the
dissent
that
the
appellation
of
the
limitation
had
directed
time
across
the
legislature
who
said
and
also
i
am
prepared
to
consider
in
that
way
you've
heard
and
concede
now
how
that
the
balance
of
the
injunction
or
it
would
be
vacated.
