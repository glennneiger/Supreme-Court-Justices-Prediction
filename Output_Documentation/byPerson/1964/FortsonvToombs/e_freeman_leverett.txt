mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
by
the
state
of
georgia
in
a
reapportionment
case.
as
will
be
shown,
there's
only
question
at
issue
in
the
merits,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
three-judge
district
court
below
properly
enjoined
the
submission
to
the
voters
in
the
1964
general
election
and
in
any
other
subsequent
election
of
a
proposed
new
constitution
for
the
state
of
georgia.
on
april
4,
1962,
two
days
after
this
court's
decision
in
baker
versus
carr,
plaintiffs
who
are
co-residence
of
the
state's
two
largest
counties
filed
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
georgia
against
the
secretary
of
state
and
other
designated
election
officials
of
that
state
seeking
in
effect
to
have
declared
unconstitutional,
the
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions
governing
the
apportionment
of
the
house
of
representatives
in
the
state
senate
of
the
general
assembly
of
georgia.
as
to
the
house
of
representatives,
a
constitution
both
then
and
now
provided
that
it
would
be
apportioned
on
a
basis
of
what
we
referred
to
as
a
three-two-one
formula.
the
eight
largest
counties
were
allocated
three
representatives
each.
the
next
30
largest
counties
were
allocated
two
representatives
each
and
the
remaining
121
counties
were
allocated
one
representative
each
for
a
total
of
a
205-member
house
elected
biannually.
this
scheme
of
formula
had
originated
in
the
constitution
of
1868
and
had
been
carried
forward
in
the
subsequent
constitutions.
the
law
or
rather
the
constitution
provided
that
this
apportionment
should
be
changed
every
10
years
following
the
decennial
census.
at
the
time
of
filing
the
suit
as
to
the
senate,
the
constitution
provided
that
there
would
simply
--
that
there
would
be
54
districts
with
one
senator
from
each
district.
the
actual
apportionment
of
the
senate
itself
was
prescribed
by
statute
which
created
52
districts
each
containing
three
counties
each,
fulton
county,
the
largest
county
on
the
state
comprised
one
district
by
itself
and
chatham
which
prior
to
the
1960
census
where
it
was
the
second
largest
county.
it
was
joined
with
effingham
to
form
a
two-county
district.
now,
this
apportionment
on
the
basis
of
essentially
of
these
three-county
groupings
that
originated
in
the
constitution
of
1861
and
had
been
carried
down
in
the
state's
four
or
five
subsequent
constitutions.
also,
since
around
the
early
1930s,
i
believe
it
was,
the
georgia
law
had
provided
a
rotation
plan
for
the
election
of
members
of
the
state
senate
which
in
effect
amounted
to
this
that
each
county
within
a
district
other
than
fulton,
of
course,
which
was
one
district
by
itself
would
alternate
in
furnishing
the
senator,
that
the
senator
from
one
county
would
be
elected
from
that
county
and
he
would
be
voted
only
in
the
primary
only
by
the
voters
in
that
county,
although
he
would
technically
represent
the
entire
district.
at
the
hearing
held
on
may
25
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir,
it
was
a
lined
up
body
other
than
the
one
senator
from
fulton
county.
after
the
hearing
on
may
25th,
the
district
court
issued
an
opinion
in
effect
holding
that
one,
at
least
one
house
of
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
was
required
to
be
reapportioned
coincident
with
the
beginning
of
the
new
session
which
began
in
1963.
however,
the
court
deferred
issuing
any
injunctive
order
pending
an
opportunity
by
the
general
assembly
to
correct
the
situation.
a
special
session
was
called
in
september.
new
legislation
was
enacted,
reapportioning
the
senate
on
the
basis
of
54
districts
containing
substantially
equal
numbers
of
population.
and
a
constitutional
amendment
also
was
proposed
which
was
ratified
by
the
people
in
the
november
general
election
at
which
time
the
senators
under
the
new
apportioned
statute
were
elected
to
take
office
in
1963.
thus,
it
was
that
the
state
of
georgia
completed
its
reapportionment
of
its
state
senate
within
something
like
four
or
five
months
of
the
rendition
of
the
court
opinion.
there's
never
been
an
order
in
this
case
up
until
this
point.
the
task,
i
should
say,
mr.
justice
stewart
was
simplified
somewhat
by
that
very
fact
that
this
was
a
lined
up
body.
and
that
other
than
the
fulton
county
senator,
there
was
not
a
single
member
of
that
senate
who
under
the
existing
law
could
succeed
himself
unless
there
had
been
an
agreement
whereby
with
the
other
counties
in
the
district
that
they
would
pass
for
that
particular
time
which
had
been
true
in
one
or
two
instances.
now,
the
case
remained
in
this
posture
until
two
days
following
this
court's
decision
in
the
tennessee
reapportionment
case.
at
which
time
the
plaintiffs
filed
a
motion
for
further
relief
seeking
in
effect
to
have
the
court
grant
them
the
same
relief
as
to
the
house
that
they
had
prayed
for
in
their
original
complaint.
hearing
was
held
on
june
the
19th
at
which
time
the
general
assembly
was
then
nearing
completion
of
a
special
session
that
has
been
called
primarily
to
consider
the
proposing
of
a
new
constitution
for
the
state,
and
secondarily,
the
enactment
of
a
new
election
code
for
the
state.
in
their
arguments
before
the
district
court,
counsel
for
both
sides
limited
their
remarks
and
contentions
primarily
to
the
question
of
timeliness
of
relief.
the
plaintiff's
contending
that
the
court
should
require
that
legislation
be
enacted
so
that
a
new
general
assembly
that
was
to
be
enacted
or
elected
in
the
november
‘64
general
elections
would
be
elected
under
this
new
legislation
reapportioning
the
house.
the
defendants,
we
on
the
other
hand,
took
the
position
that
since
approximately
a
131
members
of
a
205-member
house
had
either
already
been
elected
in
early
primaries
or
had
been
certified
as
having
no
opposition,
that
the
court
should
have
permitted
the
1964
elections
to
continue
as
normally
scheduled
or
permit
the
general
assembly
elected
in
november
‘64
to
serve
out
their
two-year
terms
and
enact
the
necessary
legislation
during
that
time
so
that
a
reapportioned
house
could
take
office
at
the
beginning
of
the
1967
session.
election
of
both
houses
in
georgia
is
for
bi
--
for
a
two-year
term.
now,
i
know
that
during
arguments
on
repeated
occasions
various
members
of
the
court
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
assuming
that
some
delay
was
indicated,
should
not
the
court
in
general
delimit
the
authority
during
the
interim
period
of
the
legislature
and
in
particular
should
not
the
court
do
something
about
the
efforts
then
in
progress
with
reference
to
the
constitution
and
the
election
code.
on
two
separate
occasions,
the
plaintiffs
disavowed
any
such
desire
for
relief
with
respect
to
the
pending
constitution.
following
hearing,
the
court
issued
on
that
same
day
a
proposed
order
which
in
addition
to
declaring
the
provisions
governing
the
apportionment
of
the
house
to
be
unconstitutional
would
also
enjoin
the
submission
of
the
proposed
constitution
which
had
been
approved
by
the
legislature,
the
date
previous.
and
secondly,
would
undertake
to
delimit
the
authority
of
the
general
assembly
which
convenes
in
january
1965,
not
only
as
to
the
subject
matters
that
it
could
consider
defined
to
be
legislation,
but
also
with
respect
to
the
time
during
which
it
could
function
or
defined
to
be
during
the
regular
45-day
session.
we
have
a
45-day
session
in
odd
years,
a
40-day
session
in
even
number
years.
in
odd
years
following
the
election,
the
general
assembly
is
required
under
our
constitution
to
pass
an
appropriations
act
and
we
have
a
session
there,
12
days
and
they
go
back
and
come
back
in
a
couple
of
weeks
and
they
take
off
again
the
appropriations
act
that
had
been
submitted
at
the
beginning
of
the
session.
defendants
filed
a
response
objecting
to
this
proposed
order
pointing
out
that
the
constitution
had
already
been
approved
by
the
general
assembly
in
challenging
the
authority
of
the
court
to
issue
such
an
order.
a
hearing
on
the
proposed
order
was
held
on
june
the
24th
at
which
time
the
plaintiffs
brought
forward
an
amendment
for
the
first
time
asking
that
the
constitution
be
enjoined
or
rather
that
in
submission
to
the
voters
in
the
november
general
election
be
enjoined.
following
arguments
that
this
second
hearing
on
the
rule
now
sought,
order
to
show
cause,
that
the
court
issued
its
order
the
same
day
in
substantially
the
same
language
as
had
been
originally
proposed.
the
order
was
later
modified
in
some
respects
not
particularly
--
not
relevant
here
on
june
the
30.
a
direct
appeal
to
this
court
was
taken,
a
motion
for
stay
was
denied
by
mr.
justice
black,
the
1964
general
election
was
held
in
which
of
course
the
constitution
or
the
proposed
constitution
was
not
submitted
to
the
voters.
as
originally
filed,
our
appeal
raised
two
questions.
we
did
not
contest
the
order
of
the
district
court
declaring
our
apportionment
statute
is
invalid.
this
court
had
settled
that
i
think
in
reynolds
versus
sims.
we
did
not
appeal
from
so
much
of
the
order
as
required
that
general
assembly
to
reapportion
itself
in
the
middle
of
a
term,
limited
this
to
a
one-year
sentence.
we
did
appeal
from
the
two
parts
of
the
order
that
limited
the
general
assembly
to
doing
certain
things
and
functioning
doing
the
45-day
session.
we
also
appealed
from
so
much
of
the
order
has
enjoined
us
from
submitting
either
at
the
1964
general
election
or
at
any
other
subsequent
general
election
until
the
general
assembly
is
reapportioned.
the
question
as
to
whether
an
entirely
new
constitution
should
be
submitted
to
the
people
in
the
procedure
that
was
then
in
forward
here.
now,
in
october
7th,
we
found
a
motion
with
the
district
court
there
were
some
question
as
to
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
in
our
mind
to
consider
the
motion
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
case
was
on
appeal
but
the
appellees
very
graciously
agreed
to
part
of
this
motion,
the
district
court
has
modified
its
order
so
as
to
eliminate
the
objectionable
features
relating
to
this
proscribing
of
the
legislature's
authority
in
the
year
1965.
consequently,
that
leaves
us
the
sole
question
in
the
case,
the
matter
of
the
proposed
constitution.
now,
last
week,
a
motion
to
dismiss
was
filed
on
the
ground
that
this
appeal
was
moot.
in
that,
the
election
having
been
held
in
the
interim,
there
was
nothing,
no
relief
that
the
court
could
grant.
unfortunately,
the
time
didn't
--
due
to
the
expedited
nature
of
this
appeal
time
did
not
permit
us
and
has
not
permitted
us
to
file
a
brief
in
our
position.
but
i
would
like
to
discuss
a
few
of
the
cases
which
i
think
show
that
this
question
is
not
moot.
now,
the
motion
to
dismiss
takes
the
position
that
because
the
1964
general
election
has
been
held
and
the
proposed
constitution
was
not
voted
on
in
that
general
election
that
therefore
the
case
is
moot.
they
point
to
the
fact
which
was
first
pointed
out
in
our
brief
on
the
merits
that
under
the
constitution
of
georgia
as
well
as
under
the
submitting
clause
of
this
proposed
constitution,
it
had
to
be
submitted
at
the
november
1964
general
election.
it
could
not
automatically
and
as
a
ministerial
matter
be
submitted
to
any
other
general
election
or
people
at
the
general
election
without
first
having
to
go
back
through
the
general
assembly
and
at
least
put
a
new
submitting
clause
on
it.
reliance
is
placed
upon
a
line
of
cases
involving
suits
for
injunctions
to
enjoin
the
holding
of
elections
or
to
require
that
they
be
held
in
a
certain
amount
by
four
or
five
of
those
cases
are
cited
in
the
brief.
those
cases
are
obviously
distinguishable
and
that
they
dealt
with
situations
where
the
injunctions
sought
relief
with
respect
to
a
particular
election.
whereas
in
this
case,
the
injunctive
order
enjoined
the
submission
of
this
proposed
constitution
not
only
at
the
1964
general
election
but
at
any
other
subsequent
general
election
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
how
does
the
court
know
in
any
case
where
a
party
has
complied
with
an
injunction
that
the
party
is
going?
perhaps
try
to
violate
the
injunction
in
the
future.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
will
discuss
that
very
point,
thank
you
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
i
had
just
begun
discussing
the
question
of
mootness
and
it
endeavored
to
distinguish
the
line
of
election
cases
relied
upon
by
the
appellees
on
the
ground
that
they
are
related
to
situations
where
an
injunction
was
sought
with
respect
to
a
particular
election
only,
that
election
had
been
held
in
the
meantime
and
therefore
there
was
nothing
thereafter
that
any
court
could
to
do
to
offset
what
have
been
done.
i
would
like
to
discuss
one
of
two
other
cases
since
we
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
file
our
brief
in
opposition
to
the
motion
then
i
will
endeavor
to
answer
the
question
posed
by
mr.
justice
goldberg.
in
j.
i.
case
company
versus
national
labor
relations
board,
321
u.s.
332,
the
nlrb
had
issued
an
order
which
in
effect
prohibited
the
company
from
giving
effect
to
individual
contracts
of
employment
that
the
company
had
secured
with
its
employees
prior
to
the
time
that
a
collective
bargaining
agent
had
been
certified.
the
court
of
appeals
rendered
an
enforcement
order
pending
an
appeal
to
this
court.
the
individual
contracts
expired
under
their
own
terms
and
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
entered
into
between
the
certified
agent
and
the
company.
this
court
refused
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
the
case
was
not
moot
because
in
the
terms
of
the
court
of
the
continuing
character
of
the
obligation
imposed
by
the
order
and
we
think
that
is
analogous
here
because
in
both
cases
orders
have
been
rendered,
the
immediate
application
of
which
has
been
somewhat
removed
but
which
nevertheless
imposed
a
continuing
obligation
in
the
future
and
will
govern
conduct
showed
a
state
of
facts
have
arise
to
come
under
them.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir.
they
want
to
vacate
it
but
not
to
reverse
it
or
not
to
set
it
aside.
in
other
words,
they
want
it
dismissed
as
moot
which
would
not
be
an
adjudication
on
the
merits
and
which
would
still
leave
us
with
the
prospect
of
a
--
an
injunction
hanging
over,
should
the
state
undertake
to
resubmit
the
constitution.
i
will
discuss
that
in
detail
in
momentarily.
if
i
have
an
answer
to
your
question
at
that
time
mr.
justice
harlan
i'll
be
glad
to
endeavor
to
do
so.
another
case
of
some
relevance
is
leonard
versus
earle
which
was
a
petition
for
mandamus
to
compel
the
issuance
of
an
annual
oyster
license.
the
licensee
had
alleged
that
he
had
declined
to
agree
to
comply
with
one
part
of
the
requirements
imposed
by
the
licensing
statute
namely
that
he
agreed
to
turn
back
10%
of
all
the
oyster
shells
for
reclamation
and
that
he
thought
that
was
unconstitutional,
pending
an
appeal
the
time
for
which
the
license
was
sought
to
expire,
was
an
annual
faith.
this
court
held
nevertheless
that
the
case
was
not
moot
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
proposed
licensee
represented
that
he
had
intended
to
remain
in
the
oyster
business
and
in
that
connection
we
have
stated
in
our
brief
and
i
wish
to
reiterate
it
this
time
that
the
governor
of
georgia
is
giving
consideration
to
resubmitting
the
same
constitution
either
at
the
january
1965
session
or
at
some
special
session.
another
case,
the
amalgamated
association
versus
wisconsin
employment
relations
board,
340
u.
s.
383
at
416,
mr.
justice
goldberg
argued
that
case
before
this
court
i
recall.
now
that
case
was
where
an
injunction
had
been
issued
under
the
wisconsin
anti-strike
law
relating
to
public
utilities,
pending
the
injunction
compulsory
arbitration
procedures
will
begin
and
award
was
rendered.
pending
an
appeal
to
the
court,
the
arbitration
award
was
carried
out,
a
motion
was
made
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
the
case
was
moot
and
this
court
held
that
the
mere
fact
that
an
order
may
have
been
obeyed
below
does
not
moot
the
case
because
it
is
still
continuing
in
nature.
another
case
is
nlrb
versus
greyhound
lines
in
303
u
s.
261
at
page
271,
that
was
a
case
where
the
nlrb
had
issued
a
cease
and
desist
order
directing
the
employer
from
to
quit
giving
recognition
to
a
company
dominated
union
and
pending
the
appeal
on
enforcement
order,
another
union
was
certified
and
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
entered
into
between
the
employer
and
the
union
and
this
court
held
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
order
had
been
obeyed
and
the
fact
that
its
need
was
not
so
much
now
as
it
was
at
one
time
did
not
moot
the
case.
a
case
particularly
significant,
we
think
to
this
case
is
southern
pacific
terminal
company
versus
interstate
commerce
commission
in
219
u.
s.
498.
in
that
case,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
issued
a
cease
and
desist
order
directing
the
carrier
from
giving
or
prohibiting
the
carrier
from
giving
undue
preferences
to
a
specified
shipper
from
and
after
november
the
15th
and
for
a
period
of
two
years
following.
a
suit
was
brought
to
set
aside
the
order,
and
pending
appeal
that
order
expired
of
its
own
terms.
this
court
held
however
that
the
case
was
not
moot
and
distinguished
the
line
of
election
cases
relied
upon
by
the
appellees
on
the
same
ground
that
i
have
undertaken
to
do
so
but
this
court
used
some
language
that
is
very
pertinent
we
think
to
our
case
and
that
is
quote.
“in
the
case
at
bar,
the
order
of
the
commission
made
to
some
extent
the
exact
extent
it
is
unnecessary
to
define,
be
the
basis
of
future
proceedings.
but
there
is
a
broader
consideration.
the
question
usually
involved
in
the
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
are
continuing
as
are
ours,
especially
those
in
the
case
at
bar
and
those
considerations
ought
not
to
be
as
they
might
be
defeated
by
short
term
orders
capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review
and
at
one
time
the
government
and
in
another
time
the
carrier
have
their
rights
determined
by
the
commission
without
a
chance
of
redress.
if
all
the
experience
in
the
field
of
reapportioning
of
a
senate
as
any
guide,
we
could
well
expect
that
if
this
court
should
dismiss
this
appeal
as
being
moot
and
under
the
munsingwear
case
of
course
that
would
care
whether
the
vacation
of
the
--
an
order
below
we
could
well
expect
a
suit
for
injunction
to
be
instituted
shortly
before
the
1966
general
election
at
which
time
the
constitution
could
be
resubmitted.
under
circumstances
when
this
court
is
in
vacation
we
would
have
it
no
way
of
getting
the
determination
of
it.
we
had
the
same
thing
in
our
senate
reapportionment
problem,
we
had
suits
filed
on
this
countywide
voting
on
multi-senate
or
multi-district
counties
and
we
had
three
cases
in
fulton
county
and
two
in
chatham
county
and
the
cases
in
fulton
county
were
resolved
against
us
and
we
didn't
have
time
to
get
an
appeal
on
it.
so,
what
we
think
is
the
effect
of
what
is
sought
to
be
done
here
is
not
to
dismiss
a
moot
case,
but
to
moot
a
case
by
dismissing
and
vacating
and
then
putting
us
on
a
procedure
called
sacro
from
which
we
cannot
be
extricated.
and
moreover,
we
submit
that
the
interest
of
the
state
of
georgia
is
more
urgent
here
for
regardless
of
the
fact
that
a
dismissal
for
mootness
would
carry
with
it
a
vacating
of
the
judgment
below,
it
does
not
alter
the
fact
that
is
obvious
to
all
that
that
remains
unreversed
on
the
merits
a
holding
a
decision
by
a
united
states
district
court
in
atlanta
to
the
effect
that
the
legislature
is
not
empowered
to
act.
now
under
those
circumstances,
the
governor
of
georgia
is
not
in
a
position
to
contentiously
resubmit
or
ask
the
legislature
to
reconsider.
we
have
already
spent
a
million
dollars
on
this
special
session
that
was
called
primarily
for
the
purpose
of
constitutional
revision
to
have
the
principal
product
of
that
session
set
aside
and
with
that
judicial
“sword
of
damocles”
hanging
over
his
head
the
governor
could
not
in
the
very
nature
of
things
assumed
the
responsibility
of
asking
the
general
assembly
to
resubmit
and
go
through
all
of
the
expense
and
time
knowing
that
there
still
is
although
no
technical
order
outstanding
that
is
an
opinion
which
is
necessarily
going
to
be
controlling
as
i
would
come
to
momentarily.
this
court
has
gotten
into
this
area
by
getting
around
or
surmounting
the
obstacles
of
justiciability
and
lack
of
equity.
but
i
think
you
must
recognize
that
they
are
considerations
present
in
this
type
of
case
which
are
not
present
in
the
ordinary
traditional
type
of
litigation.
the
effect
of
an
unreversed
opinion
of
a
court
or
holding
of
the
court
has
a
very
definite,
it's
very
much
alike
to
represent
it
as
in
to
a
political
officers
who
are
charged
with
making
policies
and
they
are
certainly
not
going
to
run
the
risk
again
of
being
accused
of
spending
all
the
time
and
money
when
they
should
have
known
that
the
court
has
already
ruled
although
technically
there's
no
order
outstanding.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
do
not
think
sir
that
the
legislature
of
the
government
either
one
could
draw
that
nicer
distinction.
now,
if
you
reverse
it
there's
no
question
then
but
to
simply
vacate
it.
it
does
not
alter
the
fact
that
a
very
responsible
and
highly
respected
federal
court
in
georgia
has
made
a
ruling
and
it's
likely
--
it
very
likely
as
a
matter
of
course
to
make
the
same
ruling
if
the
case
is
presented
to
them
again
and
mr.
justice
goldberg
i
come
to
the
point
i
think
that
perhaps
deals
with
the
question
that
you
posed
yesterday.
it's
important
to
note
here
that
the
district
court
below
did
not
enjoin
the
submission
of
the
proposed
constitution
because
of
some
particular
substantive
provision
that
this
constitution
either
had
or
did
not
have
it.
the
basis
of
the
court's
decision
below
was
that
any
constitution
proposed
as
this
one
was
by
legislature
which
it
had
concededly
was
malapportioned.
ipso
facto
and
with
that
regard
to
looking
at
its
countent
had
such
vitiating
biases
built
into
it
that
the
court
would
enjoin
its
submission.
so
consequently
whether
or
not
the
1965
general
assembly
should
change
provisions
is
completely
immaterial
under
the
rationale
of
the
court's
opinion.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i'm
coming
to
that
too.
now,
the
act
that
i
have,
the
thought
that
i
have
sought
to
convey
is
that
the
practical
effect
of
a
dismissal
for
mootness
and
a
vacating
of
the
judgment
below
is
no
different
than
if
you
had
simply
affirmed
the
injunction
and
declared
it
non-reviewable
because
the
only
contingency
upon
which
this
case
would
be
moot
would
be
that
the
legislature
either
sometime
in
1965
either
had
the
regular
45-day
session
or
a
special
call
session
would
not
undertake
to
resubmit.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
procedure
that
is
being
sought
to
be
in
part
here
virtually
assures
that
very
thing
coming
about
and
it's
a
situation
of
where
a
dismissal
is
sought
to
moot
a
case
rather
than
dismissing
a
case
that
is
in
fact
moot.
now
there
are
three
situations
as
i
see
it.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
oh
yes.
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
they've
got
to
pass
a
legislation
according
to
the
wording
of
the
court
order
at
the
regular
session
next
year
and
they've
got
--
they
can
continue
throughout
1965
but
they
will
of
necessity
they
have
to
have
special
elections,
special
primaries
during
1965
for
a
reapportioned
house
to
take
off
this
fully
one
year
term
beginning
in
1966
then
we
will
have
our
regular
biannual
general
election
in
november
of
1966
for
a
two
year
term.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
be
elected
next
year
but
to
take
office
in
1966
for
one
year,
so
they're
waiting
up
(voice
overlap)
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
–
one
term.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir,
i
think
there
is
a
little
technicality
there
within
that
in
that
respect
that
i
wish
to
discuss
momentarily.
that
brings
me
to
the
merits
of
the
case
enjoining
the
submission
of
the
proposed
constitution
the
district
court
below
relied
upon
both
federal
considerations
as
to
malapportionment
and
state
considerations
as
to
the
proper
procedure
under
the
state
constitution
and
i
would
--
i
feel
little
constrained
to
point
out
that
we
could
take
a
literalistic
interpretation
of
this
court
decree
and
actually
the
legislature
even
though
malapportioned
in
1965
under
the
literal
language
could
go
ahead
and
resubmit
the
constitution
and
when
if
you
look
at
it
from
a
purely
literalistic
standpoint
we
don't
--
we
wouldn't
need
any
relief.
well
that's
because
of
the
impreciseness
of
language
used
in
the
decree
which
is
framed
in
terms
of
placing
the
constitution
on
the
ballot
rather
than
the
legislature's
passing
it
but
we
know
what
the
court
means
and
the
court
knows
what
it
means
and
the
appellees
know
what
the
court
means
and
we
aren't
trying
to
play
“cat
and
mouse.”
we
know
that
the
whole
thing,
the
whole
thrust
of
the
decree
was
the
idea
that
has
a
malapportioned
or
a
part
of
the
malapportioned
body
undertaking
to
change
the
organic
law
of
the
state.
now
at
the
outset
we
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
state
has
consistently
evaded
its
constitutional
obligations
by
series
of
dilatory
tactics
which
when
the
court
felt
necessary
to
take
drastic
action
in
order
to
fraud
a
state
into
complying
with
its
constitutionally
imposed
mandate.
when
the
district
court
below
ruled
in
may
1962
that
one
house
had
to
be
reapportioned,
georgia
–
said
in
about
four
or
five
months
when
this
court
ruled
in
the
westbury
case
that
have
a
congressional
districts
had
to
be
reapportioned,
that
was
done
in
a
month.
although
in
all
fairness
i
think
i
should
point
out
that
the
matter
had
been
under
consideration
by
the
legislature
for
a
couple
of
months
before
that.
so
this
is
not
a
case
where
drastic
remedies
are
indicated
in
order
to
compel
the
doing
of
something
which
has
been
the
case
recently
in
oklahoma
and
also
in
the
state
of
washington
where
the
courts
conceded
the
drastic
remedies
that
they
were
employing
well
for
the
purpose
of
parting
some
action.
secondly,
this
is
not
a
case
as
i
have
previously
pointed
out
where
the
constitution
has
been
enjoined
because
of
some
substantive
provision
that's
contained
in
it.
the
court
below
was
simply
ruling
that
any
constitution
has
a
conclusively
presumed
the
rule
of
substantive
law
is
defective
if
it's
submitted
by
a
malapportioned
body.
the
basic
issue
then
comes
down
to
this.
in
the
june
15th
decisions
from
the
six
states,
this
court
has
recognized
that
in
many
instances
there
will
be
situations
where
a
malapportioned
legislature
nevertheless
would
be
committed
to,
--
permitted
to
continue
for
a
period
of
time
of
pending
compliance.
the
question
there
is
to
what
extent
during
that
interim
period
is
a
court
empowered
to
delimit
the
normal
processes
of
legislation
and
normal
functions
of
the
legislature,
constitutional
amendment
with
some
respects
being
not
considered
legislation.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
correct
so
we
don't
deal
with
that.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right.
the
legislative
function
was
complete
here.
the
function
of
the
legislature
was
complete
at
the
time
the
court
order
was
actually
signed
in
this
case.
the
motion
for
further
relief
was
filed
while
the
general
assembly
was
considering
it
but
it
didn't
pray
anything
with
respect
to
the
constitution.
that
was
decided
by
the
district
court.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
the
holding
of
some
courts.
of
course
we
are
not
presently
under
an
injunction.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
we
have
made
that
in
our
brief
and
i
plan
to
touch
on
that
momentarily.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
procedure
that
has
been
employed
here
does
not
alleviate
a
system
of
poor
representation.
it
substitutes
no
representation
for
admittedly
some
representation.
stated
differently,
all
the
normal
processes
of
state
government
to
be
hamstrung
is
the
state
to
be
practically
put
in
a
receivership
pending
the
spirit
of
reapportion
and
more
important
than
that
it
seems
to
me
that
we
come
down
to
the
crux
of
it,
assuming
that
it
should
what
type
of
question
is
that,
is
it
a
policy
of
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
legislature
should
be
restrained
in
any
particular
area
whether
it
relate
to
the
senate
say
passing
on
confirmations
of
nominations
made
by
the
governor,
or
the
passing
of
certain
legislation
and
making
them
certain
appointments
of
a
legislature
--
a
few
opposition
to
have
a
state
government.
those
are
policy
of
the
questions
which
themselves
should
be
made
by
either
the
people
or
by
some
representative
body.
that
brings
in
to
focus
the
--
to
the
rationale
relied
upon
by
the
appellees.
they
place
a
reliance
upon
a
central
kentucky
and
natural
gas
company
versus
railroad
commission
which
stands
for
the
proposition
that
a
federal
court
can
as
a
means
of
protecting
the
public
interest
pending
compliance
with
its
decrees
impose
conditions
as
the
price
of
the
lake
or
as
the
price
of
the
certain
relief
that
they
are
granted
but
its
interesting
to
note
that
the
case
itself
although
recognizing
that
that
principle
existed
held
that
the
application
of
it
in
that
case
was
not
permissible
because
it
was
an
effort
in
effect
by
the
court
to
invade
the
province
of
the
legislature.
the
youth
state
utility
commission
had
issued
a
45
cents
per
thousand
feet
rate
for
natural
gas.
a
suit
was
brought
in
federal
court
attacking
that
is
being
confiscatory
under
due
process.
the
district
court
agreed
and
said
we
will
issue
an
injunction
on
condition
that
you
agree
to
refund
ten
cents
of
the
60-cent
rate
that
you
have
yet
to
have
been
charged.
the
case
came
to
this
court.
this
court
declared
that
while
that
rule
was
recognized
that
this
was
an
effort
by
the
district
court
itself
to
write
a
rate
which
was
a
purely
legislative
function
and
that
the
jurisdiction
had
limitations
inhered
in
the
nature
of
the
system
which
prevented
the
court
from
undertaking
to
do
that.
now,
ever
since
the
dictum
in
mississippi
versus
johnson
in
which
district
court
refused
to
permit
the
state
of
mississippi
to
file
an
original
bill
attacking
the
enforcement
of
the
reconstruction
acts
by
president
johnson.
it's
been
has
been
very
well
settled
that
courts
will
not
enjoin
legislative
functions.
it
was
a
dictum
in
that
case,
but
in
the
later
case
of
new
orleans
water
works
case
on
188
--
164
u.
s.
471
this
court
enunciated
in
clear
language
the
proposition
that
courts
would
not
enjoin
legislative
functions.
the
mccord
case
involving
an
effort
to
enjoin
the
making
of
rates
while
the
rate-making
process
was
going
on,
carried
that
further.
now
these
things
come
down
with
this.
none
of
these
cases
have
delineated
very
clearly
the
rationale
behind
the
rule
that
courts
do
not
enjoin
legislative
processes,
but
mr.
justice
harlan's
decision
in
the
new
orleans
water
works
case
referred
to
the
mischievous
consequences
that
would
ensue
and
mentioned
separation
of
powers.
i
think
it
comes
down
to
this
that
separation
of
powers
considerations
its
concept
of
justiciable
controversy
the
fact
that
the
legislative
process
might
breakdown
of
its
own
accord
as
in
this
case
that
people
might
have
rejected
this
proposed
constitution.
it's
considerations
of
comity
here
with
a
federal
court
on
the
one
hand
and
a
state
body
on
the
other.
secondly,
aside
from
these
general
considerations,
we
think
that
they
are
some
peculiar
to
georgia
that
shows
that
this
particular
relief
should
not
have
been
granted.
the
constitution
of
1945
which
is
in
existence
now
was
submitted
in
the
identically
same
fashion
that
the
proposed
1964
constitution
was
and
yet
the
legislature
that
submitted
the
1945
constitution
was
much
more
malapportioned
than
the
1964
general
assembly
which
submitted
the
1964
constitution.
at
the
time
of
the
submission
of
the
1945
constitution
the
nine
largest
districts
in
the
senate
and
in
the
state
having
over
50%
of
the
states
population
had
only
16%
of
the
senate
and
yet
the
1964
general
assembly.
in
that
general
assembly
the
senate
and
then
the
eight
largest
counties
or
nine
largest
counties
in
the
state
having
43%
of
the
people
had
exactly
43%
of
the
senate
,
which
is
perfectly
qualified.
so
we
say
that
if
you
say
that
this
1964
constitution
could
not
stand
what
happens
to
our
existing
constitution.
it
was
even
more
the
product
of
a
malapportioned
body
and
its
also
significant
to
note
in
this
context
that
much
if
perhaps
not
the
majority
of
the
agitation
for
constitutional
reform
in
georgia
came
from
the
urban
areas
and
looking
at
the
proposed
instrument,
the
1964
provision,
it
is
much
more
liberal
in
favor
of
municipalities
in
the
metropolitan
areas
and
it
was
the
1945
document
contains
broad
powers
of
home
rule,
record
transit,
municipal
parking
systems,
furnishing
of
municipal
type
said
this
is
by
counties
and
what
is
more
significant
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
our
state
a
provision
was
written
in
to
the
1945
constitution
permitting
cities
to
share
in
the
automatic
constitutional
allocation
of
road
funds
derived
from
motor
fuel
tax.
there's
no
question
that
the
40th,
--
that
the
1964
constitution
was
much
more
favorable
to
municipalities
than
the
1945
laws.
this
brings
me
down
and
i
might
point
out
here
that
the
reason
for
constitutional
reform
in
georgia
has
been
the
unusual
specificity
in
detail
above
the
existing
constitution.
since
1945
we've
had
approximately
500
amendments
to
it.
this
1964
general
election,
we
had
a
103
local
amendments
alone
in
one
election
and
14
general
amendments.
the
ballot
in
georgia
sometimes
reaches
monstrous
proportions
because
of
the
statutory
detail
above
our
constitution.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
we
have
amendments
that
affect
only
a
particularly
local
subdivision.
a
classic
example
is
the
existing
constitution
says
that
boards
of
education
shall
consist
of
five
members
appointed
by
the
grand
jury.
we've
had
over
50
amendments
amending
that,
saying
that
that
shall
not
be
true
and
ex-county
that
they
will
be
elected
by
wards.
the
last
point
i
wish
to
discuss
is
the
court's
reliance
below
or
upon
its
interpretation
of
state
law.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir.
we
have
--
and
as
far
as
the
senate
is
concerned,
it
continues
in
substantially
the
same
language
the
amendment
that
was
adopted
in
1962
as
a
result
of
federal
court
litigation
stating
that
the
senate
shall
be
based
upon
population,
shall
be
realigned
every
10
years,
it
shall
be
54
districts
with
one
senator
from
each
district
and
as
to
that
house
--
it
completely
struck
away
the
3-2-1
formula
that
is
under
sought
here
and
that
we
concede
is
–
does
not
meet
the
requirements
of
this
court
and
substituted
a
provision
which
simply
said
that
there
should
be
not
less
than
a
162,
not
more
than
216
i
believe,
members
of
the
house
to
be
apportioned
in
such
manner
as
the
general
assembly
might
provide.
the
idea
being
that
it
would
be
better
to
leave
it
in
general
terms
so
that
if
constitutional
doctrine
changes,
we
wouldn't
be
frozen
in
with
something
that
we
couldn't
change.
in
enjoining
the
submission
of
the
proposed
constitution,
the
district
court
relied
not
only
upon
considerations
of
malapportionment
but
also
upon
its
own
interpretation
to
the
effect
that
this
proposed
amending
procedure
was
not
valid
under
the
state
constitution.
the
procedure
employed
in
adopting
or
ratifying
the
1945
constitution
was
identical
to
that
being
pursued
here
within
three
steps.
the
tracking
of
the
instrument
by
a
constitutional
revision
commission
created
by
statute,
some
of
the
members
of
which
were
appointed
by
the
governor,
others
of
which
were
simply
ex-official
named
in
the
resolution
itself.
the
submission
to
an
approval
of
that
draft
and
--
with
changes
by
the
legislature,
by
two-thirds
of
vote
of
both
houses.
thirdly,
submission
to
the
people
at
the
next
ensuing
general
elections.
now
the
existing
constitutional
provisions
governing
amendment
procedures
for
all
practical
purposes
here
were
identical,
under
the
constitution
in
effect
at
the
time
the
1945
document
was
ratified
and
those
in
effect
now
under
which
the
64th
document
was
ratified.
that
similarity
in
both
constitutional
procedure
and
in
constitutional
provisions
makes
relevant,
a
case
decided
by
the
georgia
supreme
court.
following
the
adoption
of
the
1945
constitution,
a
suit
was
brought
challenging
it
in
effect
on
the
ground
that
under
the
georgia
constitution
they
complete
the
new
constitution
as
distinguished
from
amendments
to
particular
provisions
that
were
separatist,
and
individualist
in
nature
could
be
done
only
by
constitutional
convention.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
in
wheeler
versus
fargo
consolidated
school
district
which
is
discussed
in
the
briefs
rejected
that
holding
that
the
convention
procedure
was
not
exclusive
and
that
is
was
applicable
only
if
the
legislature
solved
it
to
follow
the
convention
procedure.
now,
appellees
disagree
with
us
upon
the
interpretation
of
that
case.
i
think
that
the
court
can
read
it
for
itself,
it's
--
to
me
it's
very
clear,
i
would
point
out
this
though
that
the
court
itself
said
in
that
case
that
the
constitution
had
to
have
been
submitted
in
the
courts
with
the
legal
machinery
or
it
would
have
been
struck
down
even
after
it's
ratification
by
the
people.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir
and
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
court's
decision.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
prior
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
correct
sir.
prior
to
the
time
that
this
litigation
arose,
the
attorney
general
of
georgia
had
rendered
an
opinion
on
this
very
question
holding
that
the
convention
method
was
not
an
exclusive
method.
that
brings
into
analogy,
it
seems
to
me
this
court's
decision
in
the
thibodaux
case,
the
louisiana
light
and
power
company
where
the
attorney
general
of
louisiana
had
rendered
an
opinion
questioning
whether
a
city
very
similar
to
thibodaux
city
could
expropriate
the
assets
and
facilities
of
a
public
utility
and
this
court
held
that
the
district
court
was
correct
in
abstaining
and
remanding
the
matter
to
a
state
court
in
view
of
the
unsettled
nature
of
louisiana
law
as
brought
out
by
the
attorney
general's
opinion.
now
we
say
here
that
in
all
fairness
to
the
district
court
below
i
think
that
a
fair
reading
of
this
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
very
clearly
supports
our
view
of
it
but
the
district
court
itself
conceded
that
the
question
was
doubtful
and
having
done
even
that
much,
it's
certainly
we
think
was
under
a
duty
to
abstain.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
let's
see,
judge
tuttle
was,
judge
bell
was,
and
judge
morgan,
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir.
i'm
asking
you
to
remand
it
and
let
the
proper
court
resolve
it.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right
sir.
mr.
justice
goldberg
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right
sir.
a
major
contribution
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
the
state
is
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
of
course
if
the
whole
thing
was
moot
after
the
district
court
had
acted
–
and
nobody
has
seized
that
moving
around
--
how
is
that
sir?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
issue
as
far
as
we
want
an
injunction
from
the
court
holding
we
though
we'd
get
relief
from
this
court.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i'm
not
sure
that
the
declaratory
judgment
would
allow
in
favor
of
the
state.
i
think
that
unquestionably
an
injunction
suit
would
allow
in
behalf
of
some
individual
who
wanted
to
contest
the
procedure.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
on
behalf
of
the
state.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well
we
have
some
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
we
have
some
questions
that
had
risen
us
to
back
--
whether
it's
a
justiciable
controversy.
perhaps
it
might,
we
have
given
a
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
--
i
would
say
this
mr.
justice
black,
i
can't
answer
your
question
because
of
course
it's
sufficient
enough
to
me
that
we
have
not
been
directed
to
file
one.
it
was
discussed
but
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
case
was
pending,
we
anticipated
that
a
decision
would
be
forthcoming
at
the
proper
form
and
at
this
court
or
the
lower
court
directs
us
to
have
the
question
determined
in
state
courts
we
will
certainly
do
so.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
that
we
are
free
to
do
it,
yes
sir.
the
decision
of
making
of
instituting
suits
of
course
is
with
the
government
not
with
the
attorney
general
on
the
georgia
law,
so
that's
the
question
he
would
have
to
resolve.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir,
but
what
i
am
saying
is
this,
that
if
this
courts
grants
us
the
relief
that
we
ask
for
with
the
suggestion.
if
we
do
that
we
will
certainly
do
it.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
don't
think
that's
quite
a
fair
statement
of
it
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
we
think
that
as
far
as
reliance
upon
the
state
question
is
concerned
that
that
part
of
the
district
court's
determination
should
be
set
aside
and
if
that
being
so
before
any
constitution
is
submitted
i
think
that
if
that
is
the
disposition
of
this
court,
i
think
i
can
probably
speak
for
the
state
of
georgia
to
the
extent
of
saying
that
we
will
accommodate
--
we
will
follow
the
suggestion
of
this
court
and
institute
a
declaratory
judgment
proceeding
under
state
law.
of
course
that
still
doesn't
relieve
us
of
this
federal
question
that's
involved
in
this
case.
now,
to
answer
your
question
and
also
mr.
justice
goldberg's
question,
at
page
168
of
the
record,
the
last
paragraph
that
we
do
not
feel
that
it
would
be
proper
to
permit
such
new
constitution
as
maybe
proposed
to
be
submitted
to
the
people
for
ratification
or
rejection
when
it
is
as
is
the
case
here
proposed
under
the
conditions
of
doubtful
legality
by
a
malapportioned
mount
of
portion
legislative
body.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
--
the
record
at
page
168,
the
last
paragraph.
that's
the
opinion
rather
than
the
order
itself.
and
we
take
the
position
that
number
one,
that
this
question
of
state
law
was
so
clear
on
it's
face,
we
think
that
it
would
warrant
this
court
in
making
a
determination
but
apparently
some
justices
have
expressed
reservation
in
overruling
the
district
court
but
in
any
event
we
say,
that
certainly
the
district
court
should
have
abstained
on
this
question
particularly
when
it
wasn't
even
raised
by
the
parties
themselves,
the
district
court
itself
injected
this
issue
into
the
case.
it
had
been
played
about
in
the
newspapers
several
weeks
before
this
litigation
was
renewed
and
the
attorney
general
had
rendered
this
opinion
but
this
was
not
raised
by
the
parties.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
not
as
to
the
state
question.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
as
far
as
federal
question
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
there
was
plenty
of
time
for
necessary
proceedings
to
be
brought
in
state
court.
our
state
courts,
had
more
liberal
rules
as
far
as
appeals
in
the
federal
courts.
you
can
appeal
from
the
old
ruling
of
a
general
–
in
state
courts.
you
can
appeal
from
the
granting
or
denying
of
a
temporary
injunction
which
can
be
brought
and
heard
two
or
three
days
after
the
suit
is
filed
and
that
the
procedures
for
getting
a
state
court
determination
were
more
expeditious
than
they
were
as
far
as
federal
court
adjudication.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
two
to
three
months.
we
have
cooperated
with
–
seeking
to
have
a
test
case
brought
and
we
generally
had
good
cooperation.
in
most
cases
we
did
not
in
some
of
these
senate
reapportionment
cases
where
the
procedural
fencing
boxed
us
in
so
to
speak
and
the
thing
was
mooted
before
we
could
get
it
up
that
due
to
our
bill
of
exceptions
procedure.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
june
the
--
the
injunction
was
rendered
june
5th
1964.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir,
and
so
have
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir,
but
we
are
so
certain
of
our
position
that
we
didn't
think
that
it
was
nearly
arguable.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir.
we
are
still
certain.
i'm
not
interpreting
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes.
i
am
not
interpreting
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
abstention
cases
too
imply
that
the
person
invoking
it
necessarily
is
the
only
one
that's
--
that
the
duty
is
imposed
upon
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
duty
properly
falls
on
the
person
who
really
has
some
doubt
about
the
question.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
they
didn't
care.
they
didn't
raise
the
question.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
in
fact
they
twice
disclaimed
any
desire
for
that
relief
and
only
when
the
court's
order
say
we
don't
give
it
to
you
whether
you
want
it
or
not
that
they
come
in
and
amend
their
complaint
and
then
ask
for
it.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
after
the
court
told
them
they
were
going
to
get
it.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
if
you
read
between
the
lines,
you
can
discern
that
they
probably
didn't
want
it.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
which
question
is
that
mr.
justice
black?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir,
we
--
after
--
we
did
that
in
the
first
hearing
on
june
the
19th
because
i
undertook
to
discuss
it
and
judge
bell
said
“you
know,
you
didn't
deal
with
that
any
further,
the
plaintiffs
have
given
you
a
prefect
answer
to
that,
they
say
they
don't
want
it.
so
i
went
on
to
some
other
things.
and
when
the
court
issued
it's
proposed
order
that
afternoon
in
which
this
was
injected
and
then
we
came
back
on
june
the
24th
and
did
present
our
views
on
it.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
order
was
in
it
on
the
24th
and
then
modified
in
some
technical
respects
on
the
30th,
as
it
finally
appears.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir,
this
is
no
authority
other
than
the
interpretation
of
the
case
itself.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir,
we
presented
that.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
that
if
the
procedure
itself
where
the
defective
thing
which
would
be
in
this
case
that
the
judges
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir.
i
think
that
the
case
would
lie.
i
think
that
under
the
language
and
reasoning
of
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
not
the
legislature.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
they
would
enjoin
the
secretary
of
state
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
and
putting
it
on
the
ballot
but
that
would
be
because
of
some
defect
in
the
actual
submitting
procedure
not
because
of
malapportionment
considerations
or
other
considerations.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
it's
never
been
tested
to
my
knowledge.
well
--
but
i
don't
recall
it
may
have.
i
haven't
spend
enough
to
commit
myself
on
that.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
the
implication
of
what
you
said
there
was
that
it
could
be
questioned
even
after
it
has
been
reportedly
ratified
by
the
people.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
because
if
they
haven't
meant
that,
it
wouldn't
have
been
necessary
for
them
to
consider
whether
or
not
this
constitution
had
been
submitted
''according
to
the
prevailing
legal
machinery.”
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
one
--
one
point
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
address
one
remark
to
a
question
that
mr.
justice
douglas
brought
up
with
respect
to
mootness
and
that
is.
if
this
case
is
moot,
it
should
be
dismissed.
there's
no
question
about
that.
you
have
no
other
alternative.
it's
a
matter
of
just
being
an
article
iii
court,
i
think
the
question
of
mootness
goes
to
justiciable
controversy.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
case
is
not
by
its
facts
moot,
we
--
there
was
a
protest
to
any
court
vacating
a
judgment
not
on
the
merits
but
simply
in
order
to
have
the
effect
of
a
voting
review.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
what
is,
when
in
fact
what
is
sought
to
be
done
not
purposely,
not
obviously,
the
court
below
and
the
counsel
here
are
honorable
people
but
the
effect
in
this
context,
it
seems
to
me
is
no
different
than
if
for
example,
a
lower
court
want
to
issue
an
injunction
and
every
time
after
he
had
had
expended
it's
force
at
a
crucial
time
and
after
it
got
in
the
appellate
court,
the
lower
court
would
vacate
it
not
on
the
merits
but
on
some
technical
grounds
so
to
defeat
the
appeal.
we
could
continue
that
ad
infinitum.
and
that
is
we
think
--
that
is
what
we
think
in
this
particular
situation
is.
thank
you.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
we
aren't
contesting
that.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
correct
sir.
we
--
i
didn't
know
you
have
reference
to
that
part.
