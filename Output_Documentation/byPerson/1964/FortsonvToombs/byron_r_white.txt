justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
--
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
it
was
rather
clear
that
this
was
not
the
correct
procedure
to
the
policy
in
submitting
a
new
constitution,
but
the
legislature
went
ahead
and
did
it
anyway
or
was
in
the
process.
what
if
the
proper
remedy
in
those
circumstances
in
the
georgia
courts
if
a
citizen
came
in
and
attempted
to
enjoin
the
submission
of
the
new
constitution
prior
to
its
submission
or
would
the
georgia
courts
hold
that
this
isn't
the
right
remedy
you
must
wait
until
it's
submitted
in
the
documents.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
this
--
the
very
question
of
that
issue
here
where
--
that
was
rather
clear
that
this
was
an
improper
way
of
going
about
submitting
an
entirely
new
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
your
courts
if
it
were
made
clear
that
they
were
--
that
the
legislature
was
making
mistakes
would
enjoin
the
legislature.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
understand
that.
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
i
take
it
you
think
that
the
--
that
your
supreme
court
did
say
in
the
wheeler
case
that
--
if
it
weren't
clear
that
that
was
in
proper
procedures
used
that
these
--
that
it
could
be
enjoined?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
could
it
be
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
have
to
be
mootness?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
i
though
that
[inaudible]
in
the
order
itself.
i
--
i
suppose
you
would
object
then
that
this
is
what
they
need
to
prove
themselves.
the
order
of
enjoining
the
holding
the
general
assembly
in
the
city
and
[inaudible]
for
elections
and
it's
not
an
objective
of
the
[inaudible]
they
were
not,
they
object
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
position
on
mootness
really,
what
you're
saying
is
that
we
did
no
longer
have
any
controversy.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
consequently
i
would
--
i
don't
know
why
if
you
don't
think
there's
any
controversy
at
all
between
the
two
of
you
that
you
won't
--
wouldn't
consent
in
the
district
court
to
a
vacation
of
the
injunction.
i
thought
that
you
consented
to
do
the
vacation
of
the
other
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
means
that
you're
willing
to
do
it
up
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
--
if
the
court
entered
an
order
modifying
or
just
vacating
the
order
below,
not
because
it
is
moot,
but
just
vacating,
why
would
the
consent
of
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
unhappy,
you
oppose
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
we
just
put
in
the
word
mootness
here
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
mr.
leverette
to
do
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
let's
assume
that
the
legislature
hadn't
been
enjoined
from
submitting
this
constitution
and
it
has
been
submitted
and
has
then
passed
to
this
assembly
--
that
this
--
by
this
in
this
last
election.
well
that
legislates
--
that
new
constitution
has
a
portion
of
provisions
in
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
different
from
what
presently
exists?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
nevertheless,
there
would
be
now
--
if
that
has
occurred,
there
would
be
now
a
new
constitution
with
new
apportioned
provisions
in
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then,
what
would
be
necessary
after
that
for
the
legislature
to
comply
with
the
court's
order.
i
guess
what
it
means
is
to
adopt
a
new
apportionment
as
a
constitutional
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
would
the
--
or
does
the
present
--
the
new
constitution
allows
the
legislature
itself
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
reason
involved
--
there
is
not
involved
in
the
constitutional
provisions
a
--
a
question
of
the
people
voting
on
a
specific
apportionment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
reason
--
