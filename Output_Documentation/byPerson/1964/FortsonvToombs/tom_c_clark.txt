justice
tom
c.
clark
you
put
the
secretary
in
quite
a
quandary
it
seems
to
me
because
he
has
to
pass
on
this
new
acts
of
the
legislature
to
assume
this
legislature
is
going
to
pass
on
that,
would
say
generate
the
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
sent
it
on
over
to
the
secretary
and
he
has
to
determine
whether
or
not
it's
malapportioned
and
he
couldn't
do
it,
because
it
is
malapportioned
with
the
present
legislature,
isn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
it
not?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
had
an
argument
that
the
present
legislature
is
malapportioned,
do
you
not?
justice
tom
c.
clark
so
he
would
be
enjoined
in
submitting
anything?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
you'd
had
then
once
said
that
legislature
count
it
and
submit
it
on
the
court
on
the
other
side
don't
do
that?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i'm
sure
he'd
been.
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
your
motion
is
that
except
on
the
ground
of
mootness.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
it
is
a
national
analogy.
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
seems
the
analogy.
they
said,
well,
there's
federal
constitution
itself
was
adopted
in
exactly
the
same
manner
as
the
1945
georgia
constitution.
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
just
as
above
that
on
the
page
before
that
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
there's
some
language
there
which
says
that
they
couldn't
read
any
such
interpretation
into
your
constitution,
don't
you?
i
think
in
332
sad
it
long
enough
that
it
was.
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
themselves
the
question
that
says
that
this
--
that
division
of
the
constitution
prohibits
the
sovereign
people
that
they
express
it
from
amending
the
constitution
itself
by
a
convention
and
they
used
this
language
as
i
remember.
the
words
do
not
say
so.
the
language
of
the
constitution
does
not
say
so
and
they
go
on
and
say
we
wouldn't
be
able
to
by
implication
read
into
the
constitution,
something
that
would
deprive
the
sovereign
people
of
their
right,
their
power.
justice
tom
c.
clark
isn't
that
right?
justice
tom
c.
clark
of
course,
that
was
to
say
to
comply
then?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
have
few
--
one
question
to
that,
i
did
not
mean
to
--
that
they
were
saying
that
the
whole
case
that
injunction
as
a
whole
which
had
not
defied
--
which
had
not
been
appealed
from
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
so
that
if
we
dismiss
that
moot,
it
would
simply
vacate
that
part
of
it
from
which
you
took
an
appeal.
justice
tom
c.
clark
that's
right,
i
didn't
understand
this.
