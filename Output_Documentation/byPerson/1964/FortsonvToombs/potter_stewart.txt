justice

stewart
this
had
made
it
impossible
to
acquire
much
seniority,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
legislature
is
going
to
reapportion.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
within
what
period
of
time?
justice
potter
stewart
does
reapportionment
would
take
place
and
then
new
legislature
will
be
--
that
the
legislature
under
the
reapportioned
formula
will
be
elected
when,
in
1965
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
any
constitutional
amendment
submitted
by
such
a
reapportioned
legislature
of
course
wouldn't
be
under
the
terms
of
the
reasoning
of
the
court
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
have
an
argument
either
broader
than
that
i
should
think
this
constitutional
amendment
would
not
and
could
not
become
effective
unless
it's
approved
by
a
majority
of
the
voters
in
the
state,
isn't
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
my
point
is
this
is
not
a
legislative
function
that
we're
talking
about.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
suppose
the
--
a
state
could
provide
that
constitutional
amendments
can
be
proposed
by
a
small
group
of
voters
signing
a
petition
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
even
by
a
president
of
the
state
university.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
they're
not
going
to
be
enacted
until
they're
approved
by
a
majority
of
the
voters
of
the
state
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
this
submission
is
hardly
–
is
not
a
legislative
function
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
because
it
mean
that
argument
could
be
made.
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
mean
by
local
amendments?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not
asking
us
to
decide
what
the
georgia
law
is?
justice
potter
stewart
we
can
reverse
the
district
court
on
that
basis?
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
as
my
brother
harlan
suggested
to
remand
it
and
tell
the
district
court
to
not
decide
that
this
is
important,
that
this
is
a
question
of
georgian
law
until
they
have
them
to
the
georgian
court.
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
federal
--
of
the
requirements
of
the
federal
constitution,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
basic
question
before
us?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
--
i
suppose
anybody
would
have
to
really
would,
what
you've
just
said
about
the
powers
of
the
court
of
equity
that
in
between
two
extremes
there's
a
broad
spectrum
of
range,
equitable
discretion
but
still
that
doesn't
get
to
the
merits
of
this
case
which
as
a
matter
in
which
are
these
and
this
issue
alone
as
i
understand
it,
whether
as
a
matter
of
the
requirements
of
the
federal
constitution,
a
constitutional
amendment
has
to
be
proposed
to
the
--
for
the
vote
of
the
people
by
a
fairly
apportioned
legislature.
if
that's
true
then
i
think
that
would
hold
an
unconstitutional,
the
procedures
and
practices
of
almost
every
state
in
the
union
because
in
the
states
with
which
i'm
familiar,
constitutional
amendment
can
be
put
on
the
ballot
for
a
vote
by
the
people,
by
petition
of
a
small
percentage
of
the
voters
of
the
state.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
your
argument
as
to
the
equity
and
as
to
the
tempo
and
the
equities
of
the
situation.
if
the
court
was
right
about
it's
--
about
the
substantive
constitutional
issue
but
--
and
perhaps
i
haven't
made
myself
clear,
i
gather
that
it
would
be
–
it
would
violate
the
federal
constitution
in
your
opinion
for
a
state
to
provide
that
a
constitutional
amendment
to
be
proposed
for
a
vote
by
the
people
could
be
proposed
say
by
committee
of
six
people
appointed
by
the
governor.
justice
potter
stewart
well
it
depends
on
it,
on
the
requirements
of
the
federal
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
that
the
federal
constitution
absolutely
requires
that
no
state
constitutional
amendment
can
be
put
on
the
ballot
except
by
a
fairly
apportioned
legislature.
it
couldn't
be
on
--
put
on
by
petition.
it
couldn't
be
put
on
by
a
committee
or
in
any
other
manner
except
by
a
constitutional
convention
or
a
fairly
apportioned
legislature,
that's
your
position
on
the
underlying
basic
constitutional
substantive
issue
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
all.
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
merits,
that
what
we
think.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
it
would
be
illegal
as
a
matter
of
georgia
law.
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
–-
justice
potter
stewart
what?
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
for
us
to
decide
what
the
georgia
law
is?
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
one
other
question.
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
that
we
--
all
us
of
here
maybe
asked
too
many
questions
but
do
i
--
do
you
also
plan
that
as
a
matter
of
the
federal
constitution
it
would
be
illegal
for
the
1965
legislature
to
propose
a
--
a
new
constitution
to
be
voted
upon
at
a
regular
election
by
the
majority
of
the
voters
or
by
the
voters
of
georgia?
justice
potter
stewart
and
which
could
only
become,
become
the
constitution
if
the
majority
approved
the
submission
that
it
would
be
submitted.
justice
potter
stewart
well
where
do
you
get
that
constitutional
principle?
is
there
anything
in
our
case
anywhere
that
says
anything
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
all
the
way
on
what,
but
we
are
talking
hereabout
the
subsidy
of
issue
of
constitutional
law.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
you
are
right,
i
suggest
that
the
many
state
provisions
which
allow
constitutional
amendments
to
be
proposed
by
a
small
minority,
by
petition
would
all
be
unconstitutional.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
don't
see
why.
if
--
if
you
concede
that
so
far
as
the
federal
constitution
goes,
3%
of
the
voters
of
the
state
can
put
a
proposed
constitutional
amendment
on
a
ballot
to
be
voted
on
by
all
of
the
people.
if
that's
constitutional,
then
why
can't
a
malapportioned
legislature
do
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
might
be
a
matter
of
state
law
where
--
i'm
trying
to
--
on
my
questions
to
the
requirement
of
the
federal
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
--
in
other
words,
i'm
suggesting
only
if
you're
right
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
then,
you
shouldn't,
then
it
would
follow
that
a
commission
with
experts
or
a
small
percentage
of
the
voters
by
petition
are
nobody
else
except
--
it
could
--
could
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
submit
in
any
state
amendments
to
the
state
constitution
to
be
voted
on
by
the
people
if,
the
malapportioned
legislature
can't
do
it.
then,
it
has
to
be
something
at
the
--
the
proposal
itself
has
to
come
either
then
from
a
constitutional
convention
or
from
a
legislature
apportioned
in
accordance
with
reynolds
against
sims.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
if
it's
--
if
the
state
law
says
that
3%
of
the
people
by
petition
--
3%
of
the
registered
voters
by
a
petition
can
put
a
constitutional
amendment
on
the
ballot,
if
that
is
constitutional,
then
certainly,
wouldn't
it
follow
that
a
malapportioned
legislature
could
do
the
same
thing,
if
only
3%
and
97%
of
the
people
that
don't
want
it
on
the
ballot.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
a
legislative
act,
i
think.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
proposing
some
to
be
voted
on
by
the
people,
by
a
majority
vote.
justice
potter
stewart
you've
--
and
you
do
concede
this
is
--
this
is
a
narrow
and
brand
new
constitutional
question.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
a
thing
do
you
that
this
new
constitution
incorporates
anything
that's
unconstitutional
in
the
--
in
the
area
of
the
apportionment
of
the
legislature,
do
you?
that
it
perpetuates
any
unconstitutional
standards
in
so
far
as
the
apportionment
of
the
two
houses
to
the
legislature
to
go.
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
no
claim
about
it,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
do
i
understand
you
to
day
that
this
assembly
could
enact
amendments
to
the
constitution?
