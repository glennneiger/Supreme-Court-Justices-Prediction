justice
william
o.
douglas
of
course
if
we
did
--
should
dismiss
this
as
mootness
technically
that
means
that
everything
is
expunged
and
that
the
situation
that
has
existed
if
there
had
never
been
any
litigation.
that's
the
incidence
of
mootness.
so
you're
conceding
much
more
against
your
interest
by
pleading
for
mootness
and
if
the
court
back
in
sending
through
a
dismissal
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
was
confusing
thing
in
mind,
perhaps
you
don't
understand
that
we
--
we
want
that
what
the
incidence
of
mootness
is
in
this
court
when
we
so
hold
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
you
do
when
you
ask
that
it'd
be
dismissed
as
mootness.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
issue.
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
would
just
submit
at
the
specific
--
would
you
turn
to
page
200
of
the
record.
200
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
permanent
record
paragraph
number
two,
that
the
only
--
that's
the
one
we're
talking
about,
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
the
only
thing
you're
talking
about?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
whole
paragraph.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
was
one
--
if
there
were
--
if
we
followed
your
recommendation
on
mootness
then
the
legislature
would
be
--
the
malapportioned
legislature
would
be
free
to
do
anything
to
submit
a
constitution,
they
call
a
convention,
to
do
anything
that
they
might,
would
be
available
to
them
to
do
on
the
georgia
law.
justice
william
o.
douglas
including
a
new
constitution.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
you
could
bring
another
suit,
we
have
to
start
over
again.
