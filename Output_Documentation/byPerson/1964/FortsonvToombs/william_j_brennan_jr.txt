justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
attorney
general's
opinion,
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
understand
this
mr.
shackelford
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
these
orders
run
only
against
certain
state
officials?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
think
that
has
an
affect?
this
is
where
i
have
difficulty
following.
there
has
never
been
an
injunction
against
the
legislature.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
i
think
as
the
legislature
has
no
power
to
submit
it
to
the
people.
the
actual
mechanics
for
submission
as
i
understand
it
are
responsibility
of
the
secretary
of
the
state
and
other
officials,
is
that
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
present
injunction
does
or
does
not
go
against
any
submission
for
1965,
1966,
1967
on
the
part
of
these
officials?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
as
a
practical
matter,
well
--
if
that's
the
fact
that
that
injunction's
outstanding
against
those
officials
with
the
legislature,
the
1965
legislature
clashing
on
the
new
constitution
for
submission
knowing
in
advance
that
--
in
the
face
of
that
injunction
is
futile?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
shackelford,
but
before
you
get
at
that
and
i
--
i
mean,
this
mootness
problem
is
bothering
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
from
what
you've
now
said,
as
i
understand
it
you
don't
want
this
injunction
anymore.
you
appreciate
that
its
vacation
would
mean
in
no
restraints
of
any
kind
against
the
secretary
of
the
state
or
anyone
else
to
go
out
and
do
whatever
they
want
to
do
in
1965
and
there
after,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
we
vacate
the
injunction
which
as
i
read
it
here
and
as
i
gather
you
agree
with
me,
operates
against
the
secretary
of
the
state
and
certain
officials
for
1965
and
indeed
for
what
indefinite
future
though.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
you're
willing
to
give
that
up?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my
difficulty
is
i
must
say,
i'd
be
dense
about
this
but
i
simply
can't
follow
your
argument
if
that's
moot,
when
you
tell
us
you're
willing
to
give
it
up
it
seems
to
me
really
what
you're
coming
to
is
saying,
“hey,
we
don't
want
the
injunction
anymore.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
it
aside,
we're
not
interested.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i've
indicated
to
you
my
considerable
difficulty
in
following
you
how
this
is
moot.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
frankly
if
i
were
in
the
assembly
i'd
do
nothing.
if
i
knew
that
to
do
anything
it
was
futile
because
an
outstanding
injunction
against
the
secretary
of
state
for
submitting
my
end
product
to
the
people
for
improvement.
that's
my
problem
with
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
shackelford
if
i
get
you
now,
you
don't
want
us
to
act
on
the
premise
that
you
folded
up.
you
want
us
to
act
on
the
premise
only
if
we
agree
with
you
that
the
case
is
moot,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
telling
us
that
you
don't
want
--
you
want
us
to
--
you
want
us
to
understand
it.
you
don't
want
the
injunction
any
longer
and
you're
quite
willing
to
have
it
vacated
and
disposed
off
on
whatever
ground
we
could
find
to
dispose
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
about
the
middle
ground?
are
you
coming
here
and
telling
us
you
don't
like
the
injunction
any
longer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
made
the
motion
on
mootness
grounds
because
you
felt
that
it
is
your
responsibility
as
officers
of
the
court
to
assess
that
--
that
problem
to
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
also
understood
you
to
say
that
if
there's
no
merit
in
the
mootness
ground
then
you
want
a
decisions
on
the
merits.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
don't
want
a
decision
on
any
understanding
that
you're
giving
up
voluntarily
the
injunction
you've
had.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
old
constitution
had
aid
an
apportionment
for
the
senate
by
population.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
