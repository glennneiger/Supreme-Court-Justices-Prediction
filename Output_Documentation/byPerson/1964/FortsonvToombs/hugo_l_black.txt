justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
a
provision
for
declaratory
judgment
in
georgia?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
hadn't
it
been
used?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
wouldn't
prevent
it
though
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
could
have
raised
the
issue,
could
you
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
moot
now?
how
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
isn't
it
moved?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
are
not
enjoined
from
going
into
the
state
court
to
get
a
declaratory
judgment,
weren't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh
you
do
--
you're
not
sure
then
that
the
declaratory
judgment
could
have
been
obtained?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
why
couldn't
you
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
official
of
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
justiciable,
isn't
it?
being
just
--
being
indicated
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you'd
be
--
or
you're
not
afraid
to
try
to
have
it
determined
in
the
state
court?
i'm
talking
about
that
particular
issue,
under
declaratory
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
had
to
assume
that
the
state
of
georgia
is
here
presenting
his
view,
or
not
just
the
attorney
general.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
asking
us
to
overrule
three
georgian
judges
on
the
question
of
georgia
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
you're
saying
if
we
should
--
if
we
don't
overrule
it
we
should
assume
they're
wrong
enough
to
send
it,
or
doubtful
enough
and
send
it
back
and
then
stop
all
the
proceedings
until
you
can
file
a
declaratory
judgment
and
get
it
ruled
on
by
the
state
court,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
is
it
or
wasn't,
wasn't
it
absolutely
necessary
that
these
judges
in
usual
situation
had
to
pass
on
this
question
and
meet
this
problem
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
they
thought
that
under
the
state
law
that
it
--
that
was
necessary
for
them
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
people
in
connection
with
apportionment,
you
take
some
steps
in
connection
with
it,
it
was
that
due
to
the
defense
on
it,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
else
that,
you
say
abstain?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
do
you
have
submitted
these
to
get
the
determination
that
you
had
for
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
has
it
been
since
the
injunction
was
issued
and
you
knew
this
issue
was
here,
and
you
had
to
meet
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
had
plenty
of
time
and
if
you
had
desired
to
do
so
have
you
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
but
the
--
why
is
that
you're
the
one
who's
complaining
about
it,
aren't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
were
you
still
that
certain
after
the
three
judges
enjoin
your
rule
as
they
did?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
the
lawyer's
prerogative,
its
based
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
but
i
presume
the
plaintiff
didn't
have
much
doubt
left
after
the
three
judges
decided
in
his
favor.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
did
ask
for
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
we
can't
assume
that
they
still
didn't
want
it,
can
we?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
present
question
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
corrected
it.
you
said
it
was
through
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
after
the
order
was
entered
â€“-
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
present
it
to
the
authorities
and
everything
on
the
24th?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
again
the
legislature
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
whose
activities?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
after
the
legislature
had
acted,
as
you
construe
it
they
would
have
violated
no
order.
they
would
not
with
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
the
secretary
of
the
state
would
violate
an
order
if
you
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
as
i
understand
your
emphasis
somebody
said
that
that's
all
right,
in
here
because
any
body
in
the
state
come
up
or
somebody
could
come
up
and
get
an
injunction
anyhow
against
that
election.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
he
had
attempted
to
do
so
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
is
that
--
its
have
to
enjoin
the
secretary
of
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
the
legislature
has
hold
it
free
to
go
ahead
and
pass
such
a
law
if
it
decides
and
submit
it
to
the
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
if
an
order
were
made
by
this
court
which
recognized
that
fact
and
if
the
legislature
is
not
enjoined
that
--
and
it's
its
held
to
be
moot
for
that
reason.
you
wouldn't
object
to
that
order,
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
on
the
moot
order
where
we
think
--
or
know
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
wouldn't
have
any
injunction
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
--
you
don't
object
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you'd
be
just
right
where
when
you
started.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
arguing
questions
of
mootness
as
i
understand
but
in
your
understanding
on
your
part
that
where
the
state
agreed
to
the
doctrine
that
the
injunction
will
be
vacated.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
will
be
merit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
would
be
no
injunction
against
the
legislature
or
against
the
state
officials?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
would
be
just
as
though
there
had
been
no
injunction
of
the
--
if
we
hold
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
could
not
give
any
assurance
even
if
you
would?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
to
the
state.
that
means
your
own
state
[inaudible]
file
a
petition
to
get
an
injunction
and
for
this
one
even
as
the
basis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
insofar
as
the
state
being
subjected
to
filing
the
lawsuit
suggested
an
injunction
it
would
be
any
farther
the
state
would
care
to
dismiss
this
moot,
wouldn't
it,
than
if
it's
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
been
talking
less
so
far
as
the
election
is
concerned.
it
would
still
have
to
be
a
new
suit
filed
either
by
you
or
some
other
citizen?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
wouldn't
have
him
and
that
there's
a
level,
would
you
if
the
officials
dismissed
this
moot?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it
your
position
is
number
one,
that
the
legislative
not
enjoined
at
all.
and
i
suppose
you
would
argue
that
we
can't
try
to
probe
their
minds
to
see
when
they're
not
enjoined
whether
there
would
be
a
future
injunction
or
something
like
keeping
from
going
to
law.
secondly,
you
say
that
the
secretary
while
enjoined
now
will
not
to
be
enjoined
if
it
declared
moot.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
asking
us
to
declare
it
moot.
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
your
judgment
you'd
judged
that
you
fully,
the
judgment
would
be
vacated.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
no
injunction
would
be
outstanding
of
any
kind
against
anybody.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you're
giving
it
up
voluntarily
on
that
ground.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
recognized
it
for
the
access
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
urge
we
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
the
court
on
the
appeal
except
that
one
point
which
you
say
is
moot
that
is
the
injunction
against
submitting
a
constitution,
is
that
the
sole
purpose
of
the
appeal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
that
was
a
good
--
a
good
statement,
does
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
is
that
that
issue
has
been
wiped
out
as
far
as
you're
concerned
it's
moot
and
that
you
want
to
have
it
held
dismissed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
is
[inaudible]
