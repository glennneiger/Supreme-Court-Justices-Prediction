mr.
francis
shackelford
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
members
of
the
court.
we
felt
the
responsibility
to
our
clients
and
to
this
court
to
move
for
dismissal
for
mootness.
we
still
think
that
we
are
right.
we
submit
that
this
question
has
been
covered
in
our
brief
and
then
in
the
colloquies
between
members
of
this
court
and
mr.
leverett.
before
we
move
to
the
merits
of
the
case
however,
we
do
emphasize
that
the
1965
general
assembly
which
would
have
to
repass
a
new
constitution
in
order
for
one
to
be
proposed
to
the
people
at
the
general
election
in
1966.
we
emphasize
that
in
this
new
1965
general
assembly,
20
of
the
54
members
of
the
senate
will
be
new
and
67
members
of
the
house
with
205
members
will
be
new.
we
think
in
this
case
that
there
are
two
points
which
are
now
very
clearly
established.
the
first
is
that
the
georgia
house
is
badly
malapportioned
with
the
adverse
ratio
reaching
as
high
as
101.
the
second
point
we
think
which
is
very
clear
and
that
is
that
the
only
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
georgia
1965
general
assembly
may
itself
propose
a
new
constitution
to
the
people.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes
your
honor.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes
mr.
justice
stewart.
on
that
point
we
think
the
heart
of
the
matter
may
well
be
shown
in
this
fashion.
it
is
completely
clear
as
admitted
by
the
appellants
themselves
that
our
three-judge
district
court
could
have
ordered
the
house
reapportioned
in1964
in
time
for
the
1965
session.
what
has
been
done
in
this
instance?
instead
of
the
courts
doing
that,
it
has
used
this
very
broad
power
of
equity,
this
broad
power
of
equity
which
we
call
the
doctrine
of
equitable
transition
which
was
first
set
forth
by
this
court
in
brown
and
which
again
set
by
--
forth
by
this
court
in
reynolds
and
sims
just
a
few
months
ago.
under
this
doctrine,
these
three-judge
court
instead
of
doing
as
it
could
have
done
and
ordering
an
immediate
reapportionment,
it
listened
to
the
appellants,
it
listened
to
the
governor
of
the
state
who
made
a
special
appearance.
what
they
requested
was
time.
the
court
gave
them
everything
that
they
requested
for
a
period
of
one
year
for
the
period
of
1965
except
in
one
limited
area
that
limited
area
is
enjoining
it
from
proposing
this
malapportioned
general
assembly
from
proposing
a
new
constitution.
however,
it
very
clearly
gave
the
court
the
power
to
propose
amendments
--
any
amendments
it
might
desire
or
a
group
of
amendments.
mr.
francis
shackelford
legislature,
yes.
in
addition,
the
legislature
also
has
the
power
to
call
a
constitutional
convention.
mr.
francis
shackelford
it
in
effect
does
that
mr.
justice.
mr.
francis
shackelford
sir?
why
could
it
be
--
why
--
is
it
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
well
we
feel
and
argue
and
believe
it
is
moot
because
it
is
highly
speculated,
entirely
uncertain
what
a
new
general
assembly
will
do
in
1965.
mr.
francis
shackelford
your
honor,
the
general
assembly
is
itself
not
a
party
to
the
action.
so
the
ordered
cannot
and
does
not
go
as
mr.
leverett
said
to
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
the
party
is
still
ahead
of
the
--
state
election
officials
such
as
the
secretary
of
state
and
such
as
the
ordinaries
of
six
counties
that
the
general
assembly
and
it's
members
are
not
a
party.
mr.
francis
shackelford
but
your
honor,
we
have
no
objection
to
this
court
declaring
--
sustaining
our
position
on
mootness
and
it
would
automatically
follow
that
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
it
would
not
--
won't
wish
that
reasoning.
mr.
francis
shackelford
very
definitely,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
shackelford
it
reaches
the
activities
of
a
--
it
reaches
the
activities
of
course
of
the
parties
to
pursue
who
are
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
six
ordinaries.
mr.
francis
shackelford
they
would
have
violated
no
order
mr.
justice
black
but
these
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
or
could
attempt
to
do
so.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes
sir,
enjoin
the
parties
and
the
parties
in
turn
would
be
enjoined
from
placing
before
the
electorate
at
a
1966
general
election
which
is
our
next
general
election,
a
new
constitution.
mr.
francis
shackelford
as
not
being
parties.
we
think
it
would
be
very
unwise
with
mr.
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
no,
i
understand
it
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
no,
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
not
at
all.
it
would
then
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
no
sir.
no,
objection
whatever.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
francis
shackelford
certain
state
officials,
yes
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
no,
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
francis
shackelford
it
does
go
against
it
because
it
enjoins
these
officials
pleasing
before
the
electorate
any
new
constitution
passed
by
a
malapportioned
general
assembly
in
1965.
mr.
francis
shackelford
only
in
our
opinion
if
mr.
leverett's
position
should
be
sustained
here
which
we
urge
should
not
be
the
case.
mr.
francis
shackelford
our
interpretation
of
the
georgia
statute
is
that
an
amendment
of
an
entire
new
constitution
maybe
submitted
through
a
constitutional
convention
which
is
based
as
near
as
practicable
to
use
the
words
of
the
constitution
on
population.
that
convention
would
normally
be
called
by
the
legislature
which
the
constitution
provides.
mr.
francis
shackelford
a
malapportioned
legislature
could
do
that
and
the
order
of
the
court
clearly
anticipates
that
possibility
as
well
as
the
oral
argument,
the
comments
and
the
oral
argument
on
that
precise
question.
the
legislature
was
advised
and
that
it
could
call
and
all
sorted
appears
in
the
ordering
of
the
opinion
could
call
a
constitutional
convention
or
it
can
pass
a
series
of
separate
amendments,
with
these
separate
amendments
being
focused
upon
before
the
people,
but
not
to
propose
a
new
constitution.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
if
there's
a
decision
of
mootness,
yes.
mr.
francis
shackelford
our
opinion
on
that
which
is
one
of
this
is
also
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
have
moved
to
concentrate
on
the
merits
in
our
argument
but
our
opinion
on
that
score
is
that
that's
--
it's
a
matter
of
speculation
as
to
what
the
legislature
would
do
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
i
don't
know.
we
have
not
consulted
with
them,
your
honor
on
that
score
and
i
don't
know
what
they
wish
to
do.
mr.
francis
shackelford
no,
sir.
we're
in
no
position
to
instruct
â€“
to
state
our
--
our
position
as
to
either
way
because
we
don't
know.
we
had
no
discussions
of
any
kind
with
our
clients
on
this
subject.
mr.
francis
shackelford
it's
a
contingency
that
is
--
i
think
in
a
certain
effect,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
francis
shackelford
no,
we
could
give
no
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
i
could
give
no
assurance
at
all
that
that
wouldn't
take
place.
mr.
francis
shackelford
well
our
own
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
your
honor
there
would
have
to
be,
yes.
now
turning
if
i
may
to
the
merits
which
we
feel
are
so
controlling
in
our
favor
and
i
come
back
to
this
simple
point
of
equity,
this
court
of
ours
could
have
ordered
the
malapportioned
house
to
be
reapportioned
in
1964.
it
had
that
full
power.
it's
a
power
that
it
exercised
two
years
ago
in
the
case
of
our
senate.
it's
a
power
that
was
exercised
in
sims
and
reynolds
in
one
month
less
time.
the
state
itself
agrees
that
that
is
so,
but
instead
of
going
folds
away
what
it
did
was
use
the
broad
powers
of
equity
which
this
court
has
urged
and
the
doctrine
of
equitable
transition.
it
used
its
full
powers
by
permitting
the
general
assembly
to
set
with
full
powers
except
for
this
one
limited
area
during
all
of
1965
and
it
seems
very
strange
to
us
under
these
circumstances
when
the
position
of
the
state
has
been
granted
in
regard
to
time
and
when
they
were
allowed
that
broad
scope
of
powers
and
when
the
court
has
used
it's
battery
of
powers
that
exist
to
it
as
a
court
of
equity
for
the
state
to
come
in
and
say
that
only
two
possibilities
existed.
one
was
to
reapportion
the
house
immediately
and
otherwise
to
let
the
house
sit
in
1965
with
no
limitation
of
any
kind
whatever
on
its
powers.
we
urge
and
emphasize
that
that
is
not
the
case
that
there
was
a
whole
gamut
of
powers
in
between
them
and
one
of
the
great
doctrines
we
feel
that
if
initiated
in
a
very
difficult
area
and
a
sensitive
area
of
this
kind
is
to
permit
a
court
to
exercise
in
accordance
with
local
conditions.
that
power
of
equity,
that
whole
battery
of
equity
powers
that
it
has
in
a
situation
of
this
kind.
mr.
francis
shackelford
mr.
justice
stewart
we
emphasize
that
the
important
element
on
this
is
the
element
of
timing,
if
a
malapportioned
general
assembly
as
it
had
been
done
in
many
states,
and
many
instances,
i
propose
is
a
new
constitution
and
that
constitution
is
ratified
by
the
people
and
then
that's
one
situation
as
we
had
in
1945,
but
if
on
the
other
hand
the
action,
the
legal
action
is
taken
before
the
electorate
ever
votes
on
the
proposed
new
constitution
as
is
the
situation
here
then
we
submit
and
we
urge
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
question
and
as
a
matter
of
state
question
that
the
district
court
below
properly
acted
in
enjoining
these
election
officials
to
place
such
a
constitution
on
the
ballot.
mr.
francis
shackelford
we
say
it
would
depend
entirely
on
the
--
that
would
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
mr.
justice
stewart
we
suggest
that
our
position
has
what
we
believe
is
more
finesse
to
it
than
that
and
the
finesse
that
we
think
that
necessarily
has
is
that
it
must
be
taken
in
the
framework
of
the
malapportioned
cases
and
particularly
in
framework
of
this
malapportionment
case
and
when
we
take
it
in
that
framework
and
when
we
look
at
the
powers
of
the
court
of
equity
and
then
we
reach
a
decision,
and
then
under
these
circumstances
and
exercising
those
equity
powers
and
in
that
framework
in
our
judgment
the
district
court
has
properly
acted
as
a
federal
question.
i
would
like
to
turn
very
briefly
to
the
state
question
which
it
had
also
used
because
in
our
judgment,
its
construction
of
the
wheeler
case,
the
1945
state
case,
is
entirely
correct.
we
think
that
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
francis
shackelford
your
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
for
the
indefinite
future
as
long
as
a
malapportioned
general
assembly
should
propose
a
new
constitution.
mr.
francis
shackelford
your
honor,
we
prefer
of
course
for
a
decision
on
the
merits
which
we
think
are
right.
we
felt
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument
as
a
matter
of
responsibility
to
raise
the
question
of
mootness
because
we
think
that
we
are
right
on
the
question
of
mootness
and
for
the
reasons
which
i've
given.
mr.
francis
shackelford
your
honor
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
we
have
before
you
in
the
classic
situation
of
alternative
positions,
one
is
the
motion
to
dismiss
on
mootness,
the
other
is
a
motion
to
affirm
on
merits.
mr.
francis
shackelford
well
we
appreciate
your
concern
over
that
and
we
of
course
greatly
respect
it.
we
feel
on
our
own
thought
when
you've
got
something
as
highly
speculative
as
we
have
here
as
to
what
the
1965
general
assembly
will
do,
with
so
many
new
faces
that
it
is
so
speculative
that
it
does
become
(voice
overlap).
mr.
francis
shackelford
[laughter]
mr.
francis
shackelford
mr.
justice
clark,
excuse
me?
mr.
francis
shackelford
well
our
experience
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
--
with
the
secretary
of
state
both
in
this
case
as
well
as
from
observation
in
other
cases
is
that
the
secretary
of
state
is
going
to
observe
any
order
against
him
by
the
federal
court.
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
question
at
all
on
that
score.
i
don't
think
he
would
even
consider
his
own
separate
and
independent
interpretation
as
to
what
the
situation
might
be.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
sir.
and
he
would
--
and
he
in
our
judgment
very
clearly
and
very
definitely
without
any
question
would
follow
that
injunction.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
sir.
he
would
follow
it
and
again
in
our
judgment
the
specific
injunction
against
him
by
the
federal
court.
mr.
francis
shackelford
we
feel
and
ensured
it
anyway.
mr.
francis
shackelford
no,
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
sir.
and
in
the
--
and
the
alternative
and
what
we
believe
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
we
understand
thoroughly
your
honor.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
sir.
we
understand
that
thoroughly.
mr.
francis
shackelford
your
honor,
we
want
you
to
act
with
us
on
either
ground.
we
believe
that
both
of
our
grounds,
both
of
our
arguments
(voice
overlap)
mr.
francis
shackelford
if
you
agree
with
us
on
our
motion
to
dismiss
on
mootness
we
want
our
motion
to
be
granted.
mr.
francis
shackelford
if
you
disagree
with
our
motion
to
dismiss
on
mootness
and
agree
with
us
as
we
urge
you
to
do
so
on
merits
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
we
won't
be
a
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
well
in
--
insofar
as
the
injunctions
against
these
election
officials
are
concerned
in
connection
with
a
new
constitution,
we
realize
of
course
that
if
our
motions
on
mootness,
our
motion
to
dismiss
on
mootness
were
granted
that
that
itself
becomes
vacated.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
no,
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
except
on
the
grounds
of
mootness,
exactly.
mr.
francis
shackelford
exactly.
mr.
francis
shackelford
fully
and
completely,
yes.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
exactly.
if
we're
right
on
mootness
there
is
no
controversy.
mr.
francis
shackelford
that's
a
sensitive
matter
mr.
justice
white
and
on
a
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
--
on
a
state
basis
and
we
may
well
be
willing
to
do
that
but
they're
maybe
difficulties
in
connection
with
(voice
overlap)
mr.
francis
shackelford
well,
we
--
we
are
doing
it
before
this
court
because
we
think
each
of
the
two
grounds,
each
of
the
two
alternative
grounds
which
we
urge
upon
this
court,
each
is
thoroughly
sound
and
if
you
agree
with
us
on
our
motion
to
dismiss
the
case
is
over.
mr.
francis
shackelford
we
would
be
unhappy
with
that.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
sir.
we
would
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
oh
yes.
mr.
--
mr.
white
who
is
one
of
my
colleagues
has
discussed
this
point
of
sensitivity
which
you've
just
raised
and
i
think
that
i've
said
enough
in
regard
to
--
namely
that
on
this
particular
point
we
would
have
been
willing
in
regard
to
it
namely
that
on
this
particular
point
we
would
have
been
willing
in
regard
to
the
1965
assembly
to
have
moved
along
this
general
line,
but
it's
a
sensitive
point
and
so
far
as
the
parties
are
concerned,
if
i
may
turn
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
mr.
justice
douglas
we
are
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
we
would
willingly
make
a
--
and
knowingly
make
no
such
concession
as
that.
our
motion
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
our
motion
in
regard
to
mootness
goes
to
the
question
of
placing
the
constitution
a
--
of
a
possible
proposed
new
constitution
proposed
in
1965
before
the
electorate
in
1966.
mr.
francis
shackelford
in
our
--in
our
judgment
that
is
the
sole
question.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
it
does.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes.
mr.
francis
shackelford
that
issue
alone.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
justice
douglas
i
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
that
whole
paragraph
concerning
any
proposed
new
constitution.
however,
we
think
that
--
well
that
would
be
eliminated.
that
paragraph,
the
very,
very
important
decision
which
the
district
court
has
rendered
on
this
whole
question
of
malapportionment
and
the
areas
related
to
it
would
continue
to
stand,
the
only
thing
that
mootness
would
take
care
off
is
this
one
point
in
regard
to
the
constitution.
if
i
may
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
to
the
wheeler
case
which
has
been
the
subject
of
great
discussion
today.
mr.
francis
shackelford
anything
that
would
be
available
under
georgia
law
and
in
our
judgment
if
it
would
not
be
available
to
it
under
georgia
law
to
propose
a
new
constitution
as
distinguished
from
separate
amendments,
but
anything
available
to
it
under
georgia
law
would
be
there.
mr.
francis
shackelford
if
it
should
choose
to
do
so,
we
would
think
it
would
--
if
it
did
so
it
would
be
doing
so
illegally.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
we
or
some
party
would
bring
another
suit.
mr.
francis
shackelford
it's
illegal
as
a
matter
of
georgia
law,
yes
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
we
feel
that
very
strongly
and
the
reasons
we
feel
that,
i
will
--
i
will
discuss
very
briefly.
mr.
francis
shackelford
excuse
me.
mr.
francis
shackelford
the
district
court
has
already
decided
this
point,
it's
part
of
their
decision
in
regard
to
the
merits
and
i
would
hope
and
urge
that
this
court
affirmed
the
district
court
in
it's
decision.
one
element
of
its
decision
is
of
course
the
--
is
the
georgia
question
which
we
took
up
very
carefully,
in
the
wheeler
case.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
your
honor
we
do
of
course
it
is
now
declared
malapportioned
general
assembly.
mr.
francis
shackelford
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression
your
honor
on
that
point
that
it
would
not
be
attainable
from
cases
i
don't
think
except
that
have
been
decided
except
perhaps
in
a
remote
way
by
--
remote
way
of
analogy
but
we
think
in
sound
reasoning
and
we
think
the
principle
on
these
grounds
which
we
have
stated
and
that
is
the
court
would
have
been
able
to
have
gone
all
the
way
it
can
go
lesser
ground.
mr.
francis
shackelford
a
federal
question.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yeah.
your
honor
we
don't
feel
that
for
this
reason.
that
could
be
done
in
various
ways
by
commissions
or
by
smaller
number
of
our
group
of
educators
or
otherwise
but
in
this
instance
the
source
that
has
to
do
make
the
proposal
is
it
would
be
the
general
assembly
itself
by
the
way
of
our
assumption
and
it
is
that
general
assembly
which
is
malapportioned
and
that's
what
creates
the
problem.
mr.
francis
shackelford
3%
of
the
voters
can
do
it
by
means
of
initiative,
for
example,
because
those
three
--
that
3%
is
acting
very
properly.
on
the
other
hand,
they
had
been
determining
the
3%,
it
was
found
that
there
were
great
deal
of
unregistered
names
and
instead
of
being
3%,
it
was
2.9%,
it
would
all
show
it.
we
say
by
analogy
and
for
the
same
reason
here
that
a
properly
apportioned
legislature
could
--
if
this
could
be
done
at
all
which
we
deny
for
proposing
new
constitution,
but
a
declared
malapportioned
legislature
is
in
the
same
invalid
position.
now,
in
this
particular
point,
as
a
2.9
initiative
would
be
in
our
example.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
i
realize
that
and
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
which
of
course
is
what
our
malapportioned
cases
are
based
upon
and
i'm
trying
to
address
myself
to
that
as
best
as
i
can.
mr.
francis
shackelford
the
vice,
your
honor
in
our
judgment
in
such
a
submission,
the
vice
in
such
a
submission
which
brings
the
federal
question
into
the
picture
is
that
a
federally
malapportioned
legislature
is
the
proposing
body
in
this
example
as
distinguished
from
a
proper
group,
whether
it
be
a
properly
--
a
properly
apportioned
legislature
or
whether
it
be
a
percentage
of
the
voters
by
initiative
or
whether
it
be
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
your
honor,
the
constitutional
question
and
analogy
i
should
think
and
the
--
the
crux
or
point
is
that
--
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
which
one
of
these
various
mediums
are
being
used.
we
get
into
the
constitutional
question
here
because
we
have
a
malapportioned
legislature,
which
is
attempting
to
do
the
act
and
that
could
bring
us
in,
in
our
judgment
the
federal
question
that
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
no,
sir.
it's
not
a
legislative
act
--
i
would
say.
mr.
francis
shackelford
it's
not
an
act
of
legislation,
that's
right.
it's
a
proposal,
yes
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
first
impression,
yes
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
it
has
portion
of
provisions
in
it.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
interestingly
enough
by
--
and
the
provision
covering
the
senate,
it
is
by
population
but
there
is
no
such
phrase
by
population
in
the
provision
covering
the
house.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes
sir.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
a
new
statute.
mr.
francis
shackelford
allows
the
legislature
itself
by
statute
to
divide
these
seats
and
it's
a
bracket
of
seats,
a
166
to
214
roughly.
mr.
francis
shackelford
no,
sir,
there
is
not.
this
is
in
--
and
we
are
talking
only
in
terms
of
a
proposed
new
constitution,
which
have
been
enjoined.
mr.
francis
shackelford
and
which
of
course
is
not
bad
(voice
overlap).
excuse
me,
mr.
justice?
mr.
francis
shackelford
by
population
and
it
did
not
use
the
phrase
by
population
in
the
case
of
the
house.
mr.
francis
shackelford
it
left
it
to
the
house
itself.
mr.
francis
shackelford
insofar
as
the
new
constitution
is
concerned
proposed
we
--
we
haven't
brought
that
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
no.
the
only
thing
we
do
emphasize
which
we
think
it
is
--
it
is
[inaudible]
and
passive
and
that
is
that
in
the
case
of
the
senate
that
by
--
the
population
was
very
carefully
in
citing
and
it
was
equally
carefully
left
out
in
the
case
of
the
house.
mr.
francis
shackelford
if
i
may
turn
to
the
--
to
the
state
question
and
to
the
wheeler
case,
three
elements
we
think
that
the
wheeler
case
showed
that
different
action
is
brought
as
was
brought
here
before
the
amendment
is
--
or
before
a
new
constitution
is
proposed
to
the
people,
we
think
that
by
the
terms
of
this
decision
that
an
injunction
would
lie.
it
did
apply
the
constitution
was
not
declared
invalid
in
our
judgment
in
1945
was
because
the
legal
proceedings
before
brought
after
ratification
but
turning
briefly
to
the
opinion,
to
begin
with,
our
constitution
and
it's
quoted
in
the
appendix
of
the
appellant's
brief
permits
the
general
assembly
to
enact
individual
amendments.
it's
very
clear,
i
think
from
paragraph
1
that
that
is
so,
in
a
proposed
amendment
or
your
language
of
that
kind,
if
the
same
shall
be
agreed
by
two-thirds
numbers
elected
by
each
branch
any
amendment.
the
--
repeated
use
of
the
phrase
â€˜a
proposed
amendment.
mr.
francis
shackelford
no,
it
could
propose.
it
could
propose
for
the
ratification
of
the
people
individual
amendments
as
distinguished
from
--
in
our
judgment
from
a
new
constitution.
and,
the
first
point
on
this
that
the
court
ruled
in
regard
to
this
1945
constitution
and
at
the
same
thing
was
the
picture
here
in
the
case
of
the
present
proposed
constitution
and
that
is
that
so
much
had
been
to
done
to
it
in
1945
as
in
1964,
that
it
was
not
an
amendment
or
a
series
of
amendments
but
it
was
a
new
constitution
and
the
court
ruled
specifically
on
that
and
we
said
we
conclude
that
the
instrument
is
not
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
1877,
but
on
the
contrary
is
a
completely
revised
or
new
constitution
and
then
it
proceeded
to
consider
the
case
on
that.
and
then
later,
and
a
very
expressed
comment
and
having
talked
about
the
early
adoption
of
the
federal
constitution
and
the
convention
there
it
said,
speaking
of
the
federal
constitution,
it
had
no
more
express
authority
to
frame
and
submit
to
the
people
a
new
constitution
than
did
the
georgia
legislature
or
the
committee
provided
for
by
the
resolution,
we
hardly
see
how
it
could
be
a
clearer
statement
than
this
that
the
georgia
legislature
had
no
power
to
propose
a
new
constitution.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes?
we're
using
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
they
were
using
it
your
honor
as
an
analogy
but
in
connection
with
using
it
and
in
addressing
itself
to
the
question
of
how
--
up
to
what
extent
a
state
general
assembly
--
our
general
assembly
could
go
--
it
said
that
it
had
no
power
to
propose
a
new
constitution
or
express
authority
to
propose
one.
and
then,
it
continues
in
its
opinion.
we
think
and
with
some
emphasis
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes.
mr.
francis
shackelford
yes,
i
think
and
--
i
think
in
that
regard,
there
is
discussion
as
to
what
the
â€“
as
to
whether
the
only
convention
that
could
be
called
would
be
a
convention
that
was
called
by
the
general
assembly
to
do
it
and
that
was
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
francis
shackelford
but
--
mr.
francis
shackelford
mr.
justice
clark,
that
general
language
and
even
--
that
--
that's
your
--
it's
almost
a
precise
way
and
it's
certainly
had
been
paraphrased
were
not
the
precise
way.
it's
very
definite
basing
on
the
opinion
but
we
think
it
has
to
be
taken
into
the
context
of
the
time
schedule
in
this
case.
and,
the
time
schedule
was
--
this
is
emphasized
in
this
portion
which
i
will
now
read,
the
time
schedule
was
if
this
was
an
action
taken
not
before
submission
to
the
people
but
after
the
people
had
ratified
the
constitution
and
the
court
emphasizes
that
in
fashion,
bearing
in
mind
the
well
established
rule
that
every
reasonable
presumption,
both
of
law
and
fact,
is
to
be
endorsed
in
favor
of
the
validity
of
a
constitution
when
it
is
attacked,
after
its
ratification
by
the
people
--
bearing
in
mind
the
well
established
rule
that
every
reasonable
presumption
both
of
law
and
fact,
is
to
be
endorsed
in
favor
of
the
validity
of
a
new
constitution
when
it
is
attacked
after,
after
this
ratification
by
the
people.
mr.
francis
shackelford
it
would,
yes
sir.
and
that
in
our
judgment
is
the
reason
that
the
constitution
was
sustained
and
that
if
the
same
action
had
been
brought
before
it
was
submitted
to
the
people,
the
result
would
have
been
otherwise.
we
agree
completely
with
the
analysis
of
our
three
georgians
who
are
on
the
federal
district
court
that
heard
this
case
below.
we
think
that
they're
entirely
right
and
again,
in
closing,
we
return
to
our
point
that
of
a
the
broad
equity
point
which
we
has
--
we
think
has
great
merit
and
that
is
if
the
--
if
we
could
have
gone
all
the
way
here
as
the
court
could
have
and
ordered
immediately
reapportionment
in
1964,
it
has
powers
entirely
beyond
simply
allowing
the
general
assembly
to
function
with
no
limitations
at
all.
in
its
battery
of
powers
it
can
control
the
function
of
the
limitations
and
we
feel
that
it's
exercised
equity
and
the
classic
and
finest
tradition
in
this
instance
in
which
it
just
allowed
the
general
assembly
during
1965.
the
function
in
all
respects
and
in
all
ways,
with
the
exception
of
this
one
limited
area
and
even
here
if
it's
proposed
to
have
a
constitutional
convention
established
or
if
it's
proposed
to
pass
or
proposed
an
individual
amendment
or
series
of
amendments,
it's
open
and
clear
to
do
so
and
we
think
that
far
from
that
being
an
element
of
complaint
insofar
as
the
state
is
consigned
that
the
court
in
exercising
these
powers
has
given
great
justice
if
there
were
any
complaining
to
be
done,
we
feel
that
it'd
be
ourselves
who
had
a
very
strong
case
as
the
court
itself
said
for
immediate
apportionment,
but
it
is
not
we
that
bring
him
the
complaint
and
it
seems
strange
to
us
under
these
circumstances
with
all
of
this
having
the
been
granted
in
this
exercise
of
equity
powers
that
has
been
granted,
that
we
have
this
complaint
before
this
court.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
francis
shackelford
i
answered
--
the
first
of
those
was
questions
in
regard
to
--
in
regard
to
one
year,
we
think
that
on
a
--
a
balance
of
equities
and
because
there
are
certain
things
that
the
legislature
has
to
do
that
are
continuing
nature
committees
of
an
investigatory
nature,
that
it
have
to
have
certain
budget
functions
or
the
things
of
that
kind,
we
think
as
a
practical
matter,
that
it's
desirable
for
it
to
continue
as
the
court
has
done
for
one
year.
we
entered
--
i
have
agreed
to
that
by
stipulation
in
connection
with
an
order
--
an
amendment
that
was
made
to
the
order
of
the
court
and
we
think
so
for
what
we
feel
are
practical
and
fair
reasons.
in
regard
to
the
second
point
which
you
had
raised,
we
think
in
that
respect
and
the
reason
for
our
motion
to
dismiss
is
the
particular
constitution
of
course
is
now
dead
because
it
is
not
presented
to
the
people
on
november
3rd
and
we
think
that
a
highly
speculated
nature
of
a
new
constitution
being
passed
by
a
new
assembly.
it's
so
uncertain
that
under
those
circumstance
--
circumstances,
we
are
willing
to
accept
a
dismissal
on
mootness
at
that
point.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
francis
shackelford
if
it
--
if
it
please
the
court
we
would
like
to
ask
for
permission
to
file
a
supplemental
brief
on
the
broader
question
that
has
particularly
been
raised
by
mr.
justice
stewart
in
the
course
of
his
questions.
mr.
francis
shackelford
thank
you
very
much
sir.
