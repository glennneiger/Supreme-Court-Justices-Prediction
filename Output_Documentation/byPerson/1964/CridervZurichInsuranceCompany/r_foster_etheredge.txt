mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
--
may
it
please
the
court.
on
behalf
of
my
brother
and
friend
here,
mr.
max
pope,
i'd
like
to
request
the
court
to
allow
him
to
argue
the
case
pro
hac
vice.
i
understand
that
he
likes
approximately
three
weeks
to
possess
the
necessary
three-year
qualification
as
required
by
the
rules
of
the
court.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
must
confess
to
you,
this
case
has
been
troublesome
to
me
because
there
are
certain
guidelines
here
that
i
think
that
the
petitioner
has
tried
to
mesh
over
into
an
old
long
line
of
cases.
for
example,
i
am
surprised
that
my
brother
quotes
tci
against
george
in
support
of
the
petitioner's
contention
because
tci
against
george
recognizes
that
alabama
could
not
limit
what
appeared
to
be
an
employer's
liability,
wrongful
death
statute.
the
enforcement
of
it
in
the
other
state,
this
court
recognized
the
age-old
principle
that
there
are
many
cases
where
the
right
and
remedy
are
so
united
that
the
right
cannot
be
enforced
except
in
the
manner
and
there
before
the
tribunal
designated
by
the
act.
but,
the
rule
is
well
settled
that
where
the
provision
for
the
liability
is
coupled
with
a
provision
for
the
special
remedy,
that
remedy,
that
alone
must
be
employed.
that's
an
age-old
case.
it's
never
been
disturbed.
on
page
19
of
the
brief
i
cite
to
you
some
10
or
12
states
which
have
carried
this
statement
or
principle
allowed
the
full
effect.
the
tenth
circuit,
the
fifth
circuit,
the
circuit
court
of
jefferson
county,
alabama,
and
may
i
say
in
regard
to
the
circuit
court
ruling
on
demurrer,
in
this
same
situation,
this
same
facts,
that
in
the
case
of
singleton
against
hope,
an
alabama
supreme
court
decision,
it
stated
and
answered
this
proposition
insofar
as
alabama's
choice
of
conflict
of
law
rule
is
concerned.
in
singleton
against
hope,
the
alabama
supreme
court
refused
to
follow
the
georgia
law
and
said
that
the
remedy,
under
the
georgia
compensation
law,
is
proper
pleading
and
proof
before
the
industrial
commission
of
our
sister
state
of
georgia.
now,
may
i
state
this
to
you,
if
you
reverse
this
case,
you'd
be
holding
that
an
alabama
trial
court
must
administer
the
georgia
workmen's
compensation
law.
there's
no
authority
for
this
proposition.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
the
georgia
compensation
act
--
sir?
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
i
think
you
would,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
i
think
so,
yes,
sir.
i
think
that's
the
argument.
however,
in
a
practical
administration
of
justice,
all
i'm
saying
is
that
if
you
say
that
this
judgment
is
valid
in
a
circuit
court
in
jefferson
county
or
the
dekalb
county
circuit
court
in
alabama,
then
you're
saying
that
those
courts
can
hear
cases
under
the
indus
--
under
the
workmen's
compensation
law
of
the
state
of
georgia.
and,
i
--
and
in
the
respondent's
position
is
that
that
is
incorrect
also.
now,
alabama
can
adopt
or
--
on
the
full
faith
and
credit,
i
think,
alabama
has
a
right
to
say
that
the
sister
state
has
this
statute,
has
set
up
procedural
ways
in
which
it's
to
be
enforced
and
we're
going
to
recognize
those
procedural
ways,
and
alabama
has
done
that.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
right.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
in
--
on
the
facts
of
this
case?
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
alabama's
policy
is,
expressed
in
singleton
against
hope,
it
is
that
it
would
not
entertain
the
jurisdiction
of
a
claim
under
the
georgia
workmen's
compensation
acts
for
that.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
ala
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
in
this
case
at
the
bar?
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
the
dekalb
county
circuit
court
rendered
it.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir,
because
i
attac
--
the
respondent
attacks
it
and
attacks
it
collaterally
because
it
says
that
the
judgment
was
rendered
by
the
court.
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
and
it
appears
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
and,
if
the
judgment
is
void
because
of
that
reason,
it
can
be
attacked
anytime,
anywhere,
if
i
understand
the
law.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
sir?
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
that
--
it
was
not.
it
was
a
default
judgment.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
because
it's
a
question
of
the
subject
matter
of
the
suit
that
the
courts
lack
jurisdiction.
because
the
court
lacked
jurisdic
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
i
think
that
in
certain
cases
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
i
understand
that.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
but,
i'm
saying
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
in
singleton
against
hope
has
said
that
it
didn't
have
jurisdiction
of
this
type
of
case.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
i
think
that
was
1931.
it's
my
recollection.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
i
don't
think
that
was
discussed
in
the
case,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
singleton
against
hope
did
not
discuss
it
in
terms
of
the
committee
but
it
discussed
it
in
terms
of
its
ruling
on
demurrer,
just
as
the
circuit
court
in
jefferson
county
when
this
judgment
was
brought
before
it
stating
that
we,
alabama
will
not
exercise
the
jurisdiction
of
a
claim
under
the
georgia
act
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
i
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
that
is
true,
but
i
still
cite
from
the
question
of
the
policy
of
alabama
as
to
whether
or
not
it
would
choose
to
implement
the
georgia
act.
the
respondent
also
says
that
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction
because
it
is
not
equipped
to
implement
the
georgia
act.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
georgia
act
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
and,
the
georgia
act
is
really
alien
to
the
alabama's
concept
in
this
field
because,
as
we've
said,
we'd
have
the
court
that
administered
workmen's
compensation
act,
and
the
state
of
georgia
has
a
board
administrative.
now
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
on
--
after
the
board
--
the
industrial
board,
of
course,
hears
all
disputes,
makes
all
determinations
and
if
there's
been
arbitrariness,
or
--
you
can
go
into
the
court
to
review
it.
that
is
correct.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
sir?
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
i
do
not
think
so,
justice
clark.
no.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
right.
now,
may
i
say
this
in
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir,
that's
my
argument.
and,
it's
been
void
in
a
nullity
because
of
the
fact
that
the
alabama
court
didn't
have
power
to
enforce
this
type
of
case.
now
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
no,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
right.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
that's
correct.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
i--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir,
and
i'm
attempting
to
--
i
mean,
that's
what
we
are
relying
on
but,
in
an
answer
to
that,
i'm
trying
to
suggest
to
you
what
that
court
has
said
in
some
of
the
basis
for
its
reasoning.
maybe,
as
you
say,
it
is
not
necessary
for
me
to
do
that,
but
the
circuit
court
of
jefferson
county
refused
to
--
held
this
by,
in
effect,
by
its
ruling
on
demurrer
that
this
judgment
was
void
and
that
the
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction.
now,
this
court,
may
i
state
also
and
that's
the
next
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
i
don't
know
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
if
the
judgment
is
valid,
if
the
court
has
jurisdiction,
it
would
be
valid,
yes.
but
i'm
suggesting
to
the
court
that
the
cause
of
this
decision
of
the
circuit
court
is
bottom
down
singleton
against
hope
that
the
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter,
therefore,
it
is
void
and
subject
to
collateral
attack.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
it
is
a
subject
matter.
now,
may
i
state
to
the
court,
my
brother
cites
three
cases,
alaska,
pacific
employers,
and
carroll
against
lanza.
those
cases
are
not
applicable
here
because
that
was
the
question
of
whether
the
state
of
the
forum
could
apply
its
own
compensation
law
where
a
defense
of
the
home
state
was
asserted
against
it.
in
each
of
those
three
cases,
as
i
suggested,
they're
not
really
germane
to
the
issue
in
this
case.
now,
may
i
call
your
attention
to
one
or
two
items
which
i
think
have
particular
pertinence
here.
on
page
9
of
the
brief
of
the
respo
--
of
petitioner-appellant's
brief,
he's
fallen
into
grave
error
because,
on
that
section,
he
quotes
from
context
these
words,
“either
state
would
be
free
to
adopt
and
enforce
the
remedy
provided
by
the
statute
of
the
other
state,”
but
what
--
now,
what
are
the
full
words
of
the
text
from
this
court's
decision
against
--
in
pacific
employers.
while
in
--
here's
the
quote,
“while
in
the
circumstances
now
presented,
either
state,
if
its
system
for
administering
workmen's
compensation
permit,
would
be
free
to
adopt
and
enforce
the
remedy
provided
by
the
statute
of
the
other
state.”
you
see,
he
left
out
the
all
important
eight
words
in
this
case,
“if
its
system
for
administering
workmen's
compensation
permit,”
and
this
is
precisely,
i
think,
what
this
case
at
bar
is
all
about.
we
shall
say
more
about
this
pacific
employers
case
later.
now,
here's
what's
bothered
me.
for
one
thing,
this
question
about
pearson,
and
he
relies
to
a
certain
extent
on
pearson,
where
the
--
where
we've
got
a
result
now
in
the
state
of
new
york,
for
example,
where
the
law
is
applied
to
an
airplane.
as
you
recall,
it's
different
from
the
law
of
--
as
were
applied
to
an
automobile
in
the
question
of
limitation
of
damages
and
a
wrongful
death.
i
haven't
resolve
that
yet
in
my
own
mind
except
of
the
interstate
flavor
in
that
case.
but
what
he
has
done
is
adopt
a
case
as
it
present
it
to
you
on
the
question
of
this
place
of
tort
business
and
where
you
try
to
subs
--
differentiate
where
the
forum
applied
its
substantive
law
and
applies
its
own
procedural
law.
i'm
just
suggesting
to
you
that
these
cases
are
really
not
opposite
in
this
case.
but
also
in
the
alaska
packers
case,
petitioner
quotes
from
the
alaska
packers
case
the
compensation
acts
of
either
jurisdiction
may
consistently,
with
due
process,
be
applied
in
either
state,
but
here's
what
the
court
said
in
the
alaska
packers
case.
it
should
be
pointing
out
this,
“we
assume,
as
did
the
state
court,
that
the
remedy
provided
in
the
alaska
statute
is
one
which
could
also
be
applied
by
the
california
courts.”
so,
that
you
just
made
an
assumption
in
this
opinion
that
california
would
apply,
for
example,
or
could
apply
the
alaska
statute,
whereas,
perhaps
not.
now,
when
the
petitioner
went
into
the
circuit
court
of
the
dekalb
county,
he
first
sued
on
an
alabama
count
under
the
alabama
compensation
law,
and
then
he
struck
it.
but
alabama
could
have
entertained
jurisdiction
and
given
this
petitioner
an
award
under
the
alabama
compensation
law
under
the
cases
of
the
holdings
of
this
court.
for
example,
the
court
has
held,
this
was
in
alaska
packers,
that
the
place
of
injury
the
forum
state
could
apply
its
own
statute
even
though
the
home
state
statute
is
asserted
as
a
defense
to
it.
if
this
petitioner
had
stayed
under
the
geor
--
alabama
law,
of
course
he
could
have
recovered
a
judgment
in
amount
of
se
--
$11,200
which
would
have
been
more
than
the
judgment
that
he
obtained
under
the
georgia
law
of
$10,000.
now,
i
don't
know
anything
about
this
business
of
zurich
insurance
and
all
of
that.that's
not
in
the
record.
i
do
say
this
to
you,
that
this
trial
court
in
the
dekalb
county,
alabama
gave
a
lump
sum
award
of
$10,000,
then
he
awarded
an
attorney's
fee
of
33.30%
or
$3,500
which
he
didn't
have
a
right
to
do
either
under
the
georgia
statute
or
alabama
statute
because
the
alabama
statute
limits
it
to
15%
and
the
state
board
in
georgia
sets
the
attorney's
fees
in
the
cases
litigated
or
tried
under
the
georgia
act.
and
another
thing,
under
alabama
law,
he
didn't
even
have
the
right
to
make
a
lump
sum
award
unless
both
parties
agreed
to
it,
and
that
is
the
same
--
that's
--
the
same
thing
is
true
under
the
georgia
statute.
now,
in
pacific
employers
case
that
i
alluded
to
a
while
ago,
this
court
specifically
in
language
said
that,
while
the
circumstances
now
presented
--
well,
let
me
say
this.
it
is
difficult
to
understand
why
the
petitioner
rely
so
heavily
on
the
pacific
employers
liability
case
in
his
brief
because
in
recognizing
the
rule
of
law
which
controls
this
case
at
bar,
here's
what
this
court
said
in
the
pacific
employers
case,
“full
faith
and
credit
would
deny
to
california
the
right
to
apply
its
own
remedy
and
its
administrative
machinery,”
well,
let
me
get
that,
“full
faith
and
credit
would
deny
to
california
the
right
to
apply
its
own
remedy
and
its
administrative
machinery
may
well
not
be
adopted
to
give
him
the
remedy
afforded
by
massachusetts.”
similarly,
now
similarly,
the
full
faith
and
credit
demanded
for
the
california
act
would
deny
to
massachusetts
the
rights
to
apply
its
own
remedy
and
its
department
of
industrial
accidents
may
well
be
without
statutory
authority
to
afford
the
remedy
provided
by
the
california
statute.
so
this
court
has
recognized
this.
this
case,
in
essence,
in
that
posture
has
been
before
you
before.
now
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
identical?
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
my
position
would
be
the
same
that
neither
state
could
enforce
or
would
have
jurisdiction
of
the
claim
under
an
action
if
it
was
brought
under
that
other
state,
if
alabama
had
it
because
it
is
a
well-recognized
principle
running
back,
pollard,
bailey,
tci
against
george
where
these
things
are
so
united
that
you
can't
separate
the
provision
of
liability
from
the
provision
of
remedy.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes.
and
if
it
was
in
alabama,
before
the
alabama
commission,
and
that
is
nothing
new
because
the
fifth
circuit
has
recognized
that
in
the
case
of
vicksburg
versus
cooperage
when
they
have
asserted
the
louisiana
statute
as
its
defense
to
mississippi,
they
said
no,
no,
because
the
louisiana
statute
is
administered
by
the
courts.
we
administer
our
statute
for
the
courts.
we'll
recognize
and
give
jurisdiction,
assume
jurisdiction,
and
we'll
give
you
relief.
but
they
also
held
in
this
case,
in
j.a.
jones
construction
company,
at
the
suit
of
green,
the
fifth
circuit
has
already
decided
this
case.
the
fifth
circuit,
in
the
case
of
green
versus
j.a.
jones
construction
company,
said
that
mississippi
would
not
have
jurisdiction
of
a
claim
under
the
georgia
workmen's
compensation
law,
in
fresquez
against
farnsworth,
and
the
tenth
circuit
has
held
the
same
thing.
he
asked
you
the
res
--
the
petitioner
to
align
the
fifth
circuit
court
case
of
green
versus
j.a.
jones
with
alaska
packers,
pacific
employers,
and
the
other
case,
carroll
against
lanza.
how
can
you
align
it?
that's
like
trying
to
play
football
by
the
rules
of
tiddlywinks.
they're
just
two
different
things.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
that
would
give
me
trouble,
yes,
sir.
but
i
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
because
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
of
course
the
theory
would
be
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
--
on
the
question
of
whether
they
could
set
up
all
contract
actions
itself
under
a
statute,
as
to
re
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
as
to
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
that's
right.
now
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
it
would
trouble
me,
but
i
think
i
would
have
to
give
precedent
or
allegiance
or
adherence
to
georgia
on
the
case
if
they
said,
“you
first
must
exhaust
administrative
remedy,”
because
the
con
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
i
don't
--
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
think
that's
--
it
may
be
and
i
don't
want
to
--
but
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
i
don't
think
that's
the
issue
because
i
don't
think
that
you
can
refuse
court
jurisdiction
to
any
claimant's
particular
aspirations
about
the
cause
of
action
it's
creating
because
georgia
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
no,
sir.
no
sir,
because
in
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
to
me
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
but,
mr.
justice
black,
if
the
georgia
board
is
arbitrary
or
capricious,
then
the
liti
--
or
the
claimant
before
the
board
has
a
right
then
to
go
to
the
courts,
but
he
must
first
exhaust
his
administrative
remedy.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
i
think
it
would.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
i
think
if
we
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
in
the
congress
--
and
the
congress
does
that,
i
think,
in
many,
many
facets
of
human
activity
where
they
provide
an
administrative
procedure
and
the
age-old
law
is,
i
think,
that
you
must
exhaust
the
administrative
procedure
before
you
have
access
to
the
courts.
and
of
course,
this,
i
think,
and
that
is
pertinent
in
this
regard
because
it's
the
same
or
similar
thing
as
that
that
you
must
exhaust
your
administrative
remedies
before
you
go
into
court.
now,
this
claimant
did
not
file
for
suit
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
alright,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
well,
i
could
say
it
and
the
court
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes
sir.
but
i
want
to
answer
that
because
i
think
it
is
very
pertinent
for
instance.
and
i've
come
a
long
way
about
it,
if
i
may,
if
my
time
permits,
in
kilberg
--
now,
in
kilberg,
which
is
a
de
--
well,
pearson
and
kilberg
got
on
an
airplane
in
new
york,
went
to
massachusetts
and
had
an
accident.
kilberg
beat
pearson
to
the
state
court
and
got
a
judgment
in
the
state
court
of
new
york.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“well,
we're
going
to
recognize
the
massachusetts'
wrongful
death
statute
and
we
are
going
to
apply
--
we
are
going
to
refuse
to
apply
the
limitation
of
damages.”
it's
contained
and
made
a
part
of
the
wrongful
death
statute
of
massachusetts.
now,
they
had
for
years
said
in
automobile
cases,
in
lux
against
standard
oil
of
new
jersey,
that
we
--
we
will
adhere
or
apply
the
massachusetts
limitation
of
damage,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
new
york
constitution
of
1894
prohibited
by
constitutional
enactment
that
the
state
of
new
york
could
not
impose
a
limitation
on
damages.”
now,
there
came
pearson,
died
in
that
same
accident,
he
went
to
the
state
court
--
i
mean
he
went
to
the
u.s.
district
court.
judge
kaufman,
as
you
recall,
wrote
the
decision.
you've
read
--
you've
refused
certiorari
in
that
case,
and
he
said
the
business
of
this
dichotomy
of
what
is
substantive
and
procedures
got
no
place
here
because
this
has
got
an
interstate
flavor.
new
york
is
so
wrapped
up
in
this
thing
that
we've
got
our
own
rights
to
protect.
and
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
black,
is,
on
your
question,
that
alabama
could
say
and
this
court
could
upheld
or
uphold
alabama
that
georgia's
policy
is
obnoxious
stuffs
and
we're
not
going
to
follow
it.
in
that,
in
this
essence,
is
what
was
held
--
what
was
decided
in
pearson.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
what
the
--
i
didn't
understand
you,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
it
hasn't
said
it
and
in
two
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
no,
sir.
in
two
cases,
this
is
a
trial
court
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
i
know,
your
honor,
mr.
justice.
but,
in
--
in
this
case
on
the
same
type
of
facts,
the
circuit
court
said,
“we're
not
going
--
”
jefferson
county
said,
“we're
not
going
to
enforce
it
because
the
dekalb
county
didn't
have
jurisdiction.”
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
i
don't
think
it
had
jurisdiction.
i'd
go
to
my
grave
saying
that
it
didn't
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
no,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
i
know
the
case.
it's
right
here
and
i
can't
pull
it
out.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
i
think
that's
right.
i'll
give
it
to
you.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
what
i'm
trying
to
say
though
is,
of
course
the
judgments
before
us.
the
dekalb
county
circuit
judge
took
the
paper
and
it
wanted
a
judgment
and
awarded
33.30%
fee
and
so
forth,
as
i've
remarked
in
the
judgments
there.
but
it
came
for
a
studied
effect,
not
on
default,
before
the
circuit
judge
in
the
court
of
jefferson
county
and
he
said
that
court
in
the
dekalb
county
didn't
have
jurisdiction
because
alabama
has
already
decided
the
case
in
singleton
against
hope.
i
keep
coming
back
to
that.
now
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
no,
i
don't
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
no,
sir,
it
would
not
decide
it.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
i
don't
--
the
point
that
i
think
if
the
court
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter,
and
i
cite
the
case
of
(voice
overlap)
statute
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
on
the
board's
judgment
of
jurisdiction,
yes,
sir.
where
the
court
doesn't
have
the
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter,
it's
void
and
i
can
start
out
in
the
justices
of
peace
court
and
go
all
the
way
through
up
to
you
--
a
bit
up
to
this
court
and
you
can
then,
on
your
own
motion,
say
that
the
court
or
justice
below
did
not
have
jurisdiction
and
throw
the
case
out.
the
pitch
is
made
on
page
25
of
the
petitioner's
brief
that
alabama
has
a
duty
to
prevent
its
citizens
from
coming
to
public
charge
and
not
georgia,
but
the
thing
about
that
is
alabama
could
apply
its
alabama
compensation
statute
to
this
case
because
the
injury
occurred
in
alabama
and
there's
no
point
in
coming
over
to
cross
the
line
and
applying
the
law
of
georgia
when
this
petitioner
could
have
recovered
a
judgment
for
$11,200,
$1,200
more
than
he
got
under
this
void
judgment
or
wanted
to
get
under
the
judgment
of
the
dekalb
county
circuit
court.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
as
far
as
i
know,
he
could
have
collected
it.
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
as
far
as
this
record
is
concerned,
yes
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
presumably
i
recog
--
i
represent
zurich
insurance
company.
and
these
matters
have
never
been
treated,
that
he
mentioned.
and
i
don't
know
about
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
sir?
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
i
would
say
and
he
suggested
that
there
was
no
coverage
in
the
alabama
operation.
i
do
not
know
that.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
he
is
suggesting,
i
suppose,
that
lawler,
the
contractor,
was
insolvent.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
but
i
don't
see
how
that
has
any
place
with
zurich,
ultimate
responsibility
over
on
its
contract.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
no,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
right.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
in
this
case
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
would
not
be
liable
here.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
that's
right,
because
zur
--
but
because,
in
this
case,
lawler,
itself
would
not
be
responsible
under
this
judgment
and
that's
why
we're
here.
that's
right.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
i
think
that
they're
giving
recovery
under
the
georgia
law
that
they
just
recognized
that
they'll
implement
or
give
operation
to
that
cause
of
action
created
under
that
law.
i
don't
think
they're
substituting
their
own
rule
making
power
of
the
court
for
the
statute
of
the
sister
state.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
it
may
be,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
don't
know.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
sir?
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
what
is
that,
mr.
justice
black?
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
the
alabama
law,
it
was
the
point
that
i
was
making,
didn't
authorize
it.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
in
singleton
against
hope
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
the
supreme
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
--
court
had
spoken
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
that
is
correct
and
we
were
not
there
so,
therefore,
we
had
no
voice.
now,
we
have
a
voice
and
we
do
assert
it.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
sir,
that's
correct.
but
still
--
it
still
is--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
i
think
it's
--
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
said
we
wouldn't
entertain
jurisdiction
of
a
claim
under
the
georgia
act
and
that's
fine
on
the
circuit
court.
when
the
circuit
court
entered
the
judgment
on
it
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
i
think
it
was
void.
sir?
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
i
just
say
in
that
regard
that
if
the
court
in
dekalb
county,
and
we
assert,
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
administer
or
to
implement
or
give
voice
or
credit
or
credence
to
the
georgia
statute
and
not
having
that
power
to
do
so,
then
the
judgment
is
void
and
is
subject
to
attack
here.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
it
happened
in
alabama.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
they're
certain,
and
there's
a
complaint
says
that
it
happened
in
dekalb
county.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
it
could
have
applied
its
law.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
it
did
not.
it
applied
to
georgia
law.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
because
it
says
in
the
complaint.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
it
says
that
only
paper
pleading
before
it
is
the
claims
that
under
the
law
of
georgia,
and
the
judgment
reveals
and
reflects
that
he
had
to
administer
the
law
of
georgia.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
if
you
read
the
judgment
and
the
complaint
in
the
case,
he
makes
an
award
under
the
georgia
law
to
the
amount
of
$10,500
or
whatever
it
was.
so
it
couldn't
have
been
any
other
law.
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well,
i
think
if
the
court
would
have
their
peculiar
situation
in
compensation
fee.
and
that
we'd
say,
in
every
instance,
“we'll
adopt
the
massachusetts
statute,
we'll
adopt
this
statute,
we'll
adopt
this
statute,
and
give
you
a
remedy
under
it.”
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
adopt
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
well
--
mr.
r.
foster
etheredge
yes,
sir.
the
contract
of
lawler
--
the
record
is
that
lawler
was
served.
