justice
potter
stewart
now,
before
you
did
that,
didn't
you
try
to
sue
on
your
judgment
in
the
alabama
circuit
court?
justice
potter
stewart
not
you,
i
didn't
mean
you,
i
meant
the
petitioner.
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
the
--
the
circuit
court,
in
your
suit
on
the
judgment,
upheld
the
defendant's
affirmative
defense
instruction.
justice
potter
stewart
they
gave
the
merits
to
those
rights.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
mr.
pope,
as
i
understand
your
basic
argument
is
that
alabama
can,
if
it
chooses,
decide
to
enforce
part
but
not
all
of
the
liability
created
by
georgia.
justice
potter
stewart
and
to
see
what's
been
suggested,
if
i
understand,
also
by
justice
black's
question.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now,
i'm
assuming
you're
right
on
that
for
the
purposes
of
these
--
that
this
question
which
expresses
my
doubt.
this
judgment
was
a
default
judgment,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
alabama
courts
--
the
alabama
circuit
court,
when
asked
to
enforce
this
judgment
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
refused
to
do
so,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
we
--
so,
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
insofar
that
shows
anything,
it
shows
that
alabama
has
not
chosen
a
policy
which
you
said
they
have.
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
a
default
judgment.
justice
potter
stewart
and,
when
alabama
courts
were
asked
to
enforce
it,
they
refused
to
do
so,
didn't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now,
why
did
they
refuse
to
enforce
the
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
i've
--
i've
delayed
you
with
my
questionings.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
date
of
that
decision?
justice
potter
stewart
why
do
you
have
to
make
that
argument?
this
was
a
default
judgment.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
a
default
judgment.
you're
--
the
questions
you're
now
raising
were
not
litigated
before
this
default
judgment
were
added,
were
they?
justice
potter
stewart
because
it
was
default.
justice
potter
stewart
then
as
soon
as
they
were
litigated
in
this
court
of
the
state
of
alabama,
the
circuit
court
upheld
your
position,
didn't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
why
can't
you
just
rely
on
that?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
later
expression
of
alabama
law
by
the
alabama
court.
