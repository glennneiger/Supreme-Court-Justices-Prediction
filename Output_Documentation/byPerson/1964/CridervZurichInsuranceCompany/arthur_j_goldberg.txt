(inaudible)
--
in
the
georgia
compensation
statute.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
can
you
describe
to
me
what
type
of
(inaudible)
that
you
could
not
do
in
georgia
in
court
under
that
statute.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
isn't
that
right?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
do
you
have
cases
with
whom
that
under
the
state
dealing
with
its
own
common
law
with
this
problem
(inaudible)
authority,
isn't
it?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
since
before
the
last
day
before
he
could
ever
be
in
court.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
you
mean
mr.
pope
that
the
state
court
or
any
of
the
courts
in
the
alabama
state
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
that's
the
cause
of
action.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
do
you
disregard
the
alabama
statute,
(inaudible)
so
to
speak
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
thought
carroll
argued
(inaudible)
but
i
thought
carroll
did,
one
of
his
(inaudible)
apply
its
own
compensation
statute.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
this
warrant
could
define
the
common
law.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
this
--
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(voice
overlap)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
say
zurich
did
business
in
alabama?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you've
got
personal
service,
don't
you?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
why
is
it
that
alabama
ended
up
with
an
identical
workmen's
compensation
statute?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
complaint
would
have
to
be
filed
before
the
georgia
commission.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
hasn't
the
georgia
statute
pleaded
at
least
one?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
would
you
think
that
(inaudible)
under
the
georgia
statute?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
pleading
here
is
not
in
the
record.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
this
is
the
written
complaint.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)--
which
is
not
the
compensation
law
of
georgia.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
how
could
georgia
do
anything
without
competence?
forget
about
the
remedy
for
a
moment.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
obviously
to
enter
a
judgment
on
this
complaint
to
support
the
(inaudible)
in
georgia
have
in
pearson,
would
it
not?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
would
be
the
basis
of
the
courts,
what
can
be
the
basis
--
when
the
plaintiff
who
didn't
abuse
it.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that's
the
procedure
in
alabama.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
do
you
prove
damages
under
a
default
judgment?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
would
be
making
substantive
effort
if
they
proceeded
with
the
filing
of
this
case
(inaudible).
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
georgia
compensation
statute?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
is
the
problem
of
this
complaint?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i'm
not
talking
about
a
defense.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i'm
talking
about
the
claim.
would
it
not,
in
support
of
the
claim,
set
forth
in
the
complaint
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
would
you
not
have
to
prove
--
forget
about
a
defense,
forget
about
the
remedy.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
would
you
not
have
to
prove
such
benefits
that
he's
entitled
to
receive
under
the
workmen's
compensation
laws
of
georgia?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
how
would
you
get
around
singleton,
assuming
it
has
been
raised
by
a
proper
demurrer
as
it
seemed?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
would
you
say
--
isn't
it
--
do
i
read
singleton
correctly
that
your
court
in
alabama
has
said
that
where
a
property
raised
by
a
demurrer,
the
demurrer
would
be
sufficient?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but,
mr.
pope,
your
complaint
--
i
go
back
to
your
complaint.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
assert
a
right
in
your
complaint
under
georgia
law.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
there
is
no
question
before
us
as
to
your
right,
if
you
had
wanted
to
proceed
under
alabama
law,
but
in
singleton,
i
have
the
singleton
decision
before
me
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
it
says
“the
rights
ought
to
be
enforced
at
its
origin
and
existence
in
the
georgia
workmen's
compensation
statute.”
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
remedies
for
its
breach
are
recoverable
in
the
manner
provided
by
proper
pleadings
of
procedure
before
the
industrial
commission
of
our
sister
state.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
such
remedies
are
exclusive.
there
was
no
error
in
sustaining
the
demurrer.
it
then
went
on.
so,
assuming,
as
we
must,
in
your
complaint
that
your
course
of
action
had
its
origin
in
the
georgia
law,
i
take
it
that
had
by
proper
demurrer
and
the
questions
is
--
it
was
not
raised
here
or
recognized.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
had
it
been
raised
by
a
proper
demurrer,
your
law
in
alabama
would
have
been,
as
expressed
in
singleton,
to
sustain
that
demurrer.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
think
the
facts
are
stronger
in
support
of
singleton
in
this
case,
had
it
been
raised
by
a
demurrer
because
the
complaint
expressly
rests
on
the
georgia
statute.
