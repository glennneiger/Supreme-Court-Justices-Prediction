justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
i
understand
you
to
say,
mr.
pope,
the
zurich
policy
covered
liability
only
when
liability
was
found
under
georgia
law,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
ask.
that
wouldn't
preclude
though,
would
it,
for
an
injury
in
alabama
a
recovery
under
the
alabama
compensation
law
against
the
employer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
say
under
this
policy
that
would
not
make
zurich
liable
if
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
the
judgment
were
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
still
wouldn't
be
recoverable
--
wouldn't
the
judgment
being
recoverable
against
the
employer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
didn't
--
i
have
to
ask
this
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
that
go
in
terms
of
jurisdiction
or
in
terms
of
the
common?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
recall
when
i
was
on
the
new
jersey
supreme
court,
we
had
problems
of
this
kind
and
we
held
--
we
dealt
with
them
not
in
terms
of
jurisdiction
of
full
faith
and
credit
but
rather,
in
terms
of
the
committee
that
new
jersey
courts
would
give
to
a,
to
quote
particularly
new
york
compensation
law
in
its
particular
provision.
now,
singleton
is
in
that
area.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
we're
not
talking
in
terms
of
jurisdiction,
are
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
a
very
different
thing.
it
seems
to
me
that
doesn't
go
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
trial
court,
does
it?
it
may
be
policy
of
alabama
not
to
enforce
those
claims,
but
that's
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
it's
question
of
jurisdiction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
goes
--
that
goes
to
the
idea
that
this
right
and
remedy
business
being
so
intertwined.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i
wonder,
mr.
etheredge
when
an
alabama
court
says
“well,
we
could
give
you
a
recovery,
the
injury
happened
here,
under
our
workmen's
compensation
act,
under
our
common
law
rule
but
now,
we'll
pick
something
else
out.
we'll
give
you
recovery
under
the
massachusetts
law,
the
georgia
law,
or
something
else.”
are
they
really
giving
a
recovery
under
georgia
law
or
are
they
giving
a
recovery
under
alabama
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
familiar
with
the
principle
for
example
if
we
apply
in
the
national
law
cases.
you
say
“we're
not
applying
international
law.
we're
adopting
an
international
rule
as
our
forum
law.”
why
isn't
that
something
like
this?
is
this
case
something
like
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that's
so,
then
what
is
the
whole
full
faith
and
credit
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
what
is
there
then
for
the
whole
jurisdictional
argument,
if
that's
actually
what
they
did?
just
picked
out
the
law
that
they
chose
to
apply
as
alabama
law
for
the
purposes
of
the
clauses,
if
that's
what
we've
done
then
there's
no
jurisdictional
argument.
