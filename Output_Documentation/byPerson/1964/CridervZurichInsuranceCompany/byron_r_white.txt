justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
really
be
saying
that
--
wouldn't
we
really
just
be
saying
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
doesn't
forbid
or
require
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
alabama
didn't
--
decided
not
to
enforce
the
georgia
law,
i
supposed
to
decide
that
way,
but
if
it
decided
to
try
to
enforce
to
do
it,
the
question
is,
does
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
forbid
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
that
have
to
be
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
difference?
that
argument
is
--
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that
argument,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
the
question
is,
what
is
alabama's
pol
--
what
is
alabama's
policy
in
a
situation
like
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
--
the
question
of
jurisdiction
could
have
been
raised
and
litigated
in
the
alabama
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
wasn't
raised
and
litigated,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet
there
was
personal
service
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
personal
service,
the
defendant
could
have
raised
and
litigated
the
question
of
jurisdiction
in
the
alabama
court.
he
chose
not
to
do
so
and
didn't
appeal.
now,
why
should
that
judgment
deal
with
the
collateral
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
the
--
what
do
you
conceive
to
be
the
normal
rule
of
res
judicata?
it
normally
covers
matters
that
were
litigated
or
could
have
been
litigated
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
case.
now,
does
that
extend
the
jurisdiction
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
justice
black
asked
you
a
moment
ago
that
let's
assume
that
you
would
come
in
here
and
had
litigated
the
jurisdiction
and
had
lost.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
let's
assume
that
you
had
come
in,
pleaded
that
--
pleaded
singleton
against
hope
and
the
lower
court
refused
to
go
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
lost,
and
you
say
you'd
go
to
your
grave
saying,
“no
jurisdiction,”
and
you
didn't
appeal.
and
then,
you
defended
in
the
federal
district
court
on
the
enforcement
of
the
judgment,
“no
jurisdiction.”
would
you
make
the
same
argument
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
make
the
same
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
difference
between
the
two
situations
in
your
mind?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
say
that
--
you
just
say
res
judicata
never
operates
again
on
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
could
have
recovered
more
money
under
alabama
law,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
could
he
have
collected
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course,
there
must
be
some
reason
for
somebody
relying
on
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
except
that
zurich
wouldn't
be
liable
on
alabama
--
under
alabama
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
rendered
--
on
the
judgment
rendered
--
justice
byron
r.
white
zurich
would
not
be
responsible,
as
lawler
would
argue,
in
this
case.
