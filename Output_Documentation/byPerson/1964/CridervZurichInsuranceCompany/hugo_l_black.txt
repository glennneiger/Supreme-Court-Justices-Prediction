justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
under
the
alabama
death
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
georgia
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
employee's
liability?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alabama
had
provided,
had
it
not,
that
it
could
not
be
enforced
in
another
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
say
here
is
that
georgia
has
created
a
liability
in
a
case
of
this
kind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
provided
that
it
cannot
be
enforced
in
the
law
and
the
courts
of
georgia.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
that's
not
binding
on
the
other
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
they,
since
they
have
the
liability
created,
can
choose
their
own
methods
for
enforcing
the
liability.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
rely
for
that
on
tennessee
against
georgia.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
question
is,
as
i
understand
it,
whether
a
state
has
power
by
the
statute,
recovery
statute
of
this
kind,
the
limit
to
recover
it
and
the
method
it
suggest
has
its
own
state
administrative
agents.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
limit
it
that
thereby,
deprives
that
case
of
being
tried
in
any
other
state
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
even
though
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
that
kind
of
a
case.
now,
you
do
have
this
definite
condition
in
the
georgia
case,
do
you
not?
that
they're
called
the
georgia
case
a
transitory
cause
of
action.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
see
any
difference
in
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
ground
of
the
georgia
--
of
the
georgia
statute
holding
that
alaba
--
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional?
it
was
trying
to
deprive
the
other
state
to
try
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
ground?
did
they
--
as
i
read
the
case,
they
held
that
denied
full
faith
and
credit
to
a
substantial
part
of
the
alabama
law
which
created
the
liability.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
has
done
so
in
this
case,
hasn't
it?
and
it
has
not
been
appealed
and
reversed
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
supreme
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
case,
there
has
been
a
judgment
rendered
by
the
alabama
court,
hasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
right,
but
what
happened
to
that
judgment?
you're
attacking
it
collaterally
in
the
federal
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
alabama
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction
to
try
a
case
of
that
kind?
you
said
it
didn't
have
jurisdiction
to
try
this
particular
case,
for
this
particular
injury
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
of
the
georgia
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
can
georgia
law,
didn't
they
say
in
this
other
case
that
one
state
can't
deprive
another
court
of
its
jurisdiction,
the
state
of
its
court's
jurisdiction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
saying
what
would
have
happened
if
you
had
challenged
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
it
had
gone
up
to
the
supreme
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
in
effect
here
is
that
you're
may
be
right,
isn't
it,
that
you
had
a
perfectly
good
defense
for
this
case
from
the
alabama
law
in
singleton?
you'd
gone
into
court
but
you
didn't
chose
to
go
in
as
a
personal
service.
and
now,
you're
saying
that
the
judgment
is
invalid.
the
whole
involvement
can
get
collaterally
attacked
anywhere
as
a
complete
nullity.
that's
your
real
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
judgment
would
have
been
any
better
or
any
stronger
go
in
and
litigate
it
in
the
law
than
it
is
now?
but
in
default,
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it's
a
judgment,
i
suppose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
the
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
settles
it,
doesn't
it,
if
it's
a
valid
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you'd
have
to
go
to
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
etheredge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
georgia,
instead
of
just
being
a
personal
injury
case
than
a
contract
case,
suppose
they
pass
a
law
that
they're
asking
georgia,
the
courts
should
not
try
contract
cases.
they
would
allow
recovery
but
it
had
to
be
before
special
georgia
agency.
would
you
say
that
that
would
get
you
into
trouble?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
would
it
give
you
any
more
than
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
it
shouldn't
or
should,
but
why
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
they
did
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
did
it
and
confide
with
georgia
law,
they'd
be
in
georgia,
wouldn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
wouldn't
it
be
possible
in
alabama?
justice
hugo
l.
black
like
you
say
this
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that
that
is
the
only
remedy
you
could
have?
we're
going
to
have
completely
this
kind
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
before
it
went
into
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
what
you're
arguing
here,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
course
of
action
of
some
kind
is
created
because
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
money
involved
and
there's
a
due
to
pay
it.
if
he
gets
hurt
in
a
certain
way,
it's
certain
kind
of
injury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
they've
provided
that
in
contracts
in
georgia
that
you
have
to
first
exhaust
the
administrative
remedy
before
you
could
go
to
the
court,
but
you
could
go
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
later
on,
and
they
came
over
to
alabama
and
said
“we
live
over
here,
he
over
here,
and
we
want
to
sue
him
here.”
would
that
bar
alabama
from
trying
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
it
would?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
logically
it
would
under
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
that
law
--
let's
go
one
step
further.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
that
law
but
alabama
had
decided
they
couldn't
--
it
would
follow
but
it
gave
its
courts
a
jurisdiction
of
contract
cases.
could
you
go
in
and
say,
“you
don't
have
jurisdiction
of
this
case”?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
be
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
takes
up
the
--
and
it's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
said
the
policy
of
this
part
of
the
act
was
obnoxious
if
you're
trying
to
go
into
court,
suppose
alabama
said
that.
what
will
happen
then?could
it
try
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alabama
would
say
that
the
procedural
part
of
ala
--
of
georgia's
law
was
obnoxious
to
it,
but
it
liked
its
other
point.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
it
given
a
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
this
case
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
now
is
that
if
you
would've
fought
it
in
the
dekalb
county
court,
you
could
beat
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
other
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
i
won't
bother
you
anymore.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
asking
this
because
of
the
vague
recollection
i
have
that
sometime
after
the
georgia
case,
the
case
went
up
in
tennessee
to
this
court.
judge
brandeis
wrote
the
opinion
in
which
he
held
that
the
alabama
statute
which
forbad
other
states
to
render
judgments
on
its
punitive
death
action
cases
was
unconstitutional.
am
i
right
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
that
case?
it's
not
cited.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
can't
either.
it
seems
to
me
like
its
nashville
and
chattanooga.
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
guess
you
know
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
guess
you
know,
it
may
not
be
material
to
you
but
he
stated
it,
i
guess
it
must
be
a
fact.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
about
the
insolvency.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
wasn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
in
the
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
bothers
me
about
that
is,
why
do
we
not
have
to
assume
that
that's
what
the
state
court
did
if
that's
necessary
to
see
the
constitutionality
of
the
action?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
we
not
have
to
assume
that
they
rendered
the
judgment,
they
rendered
it
on
the
basis
that
it's
alabama
law
that
authorized
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
know.
that's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
had
raised
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
had
raised
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
keep
--
it
brings
me
back
every
time
to
the
fact
that
it
wasn't
raised
because
it
is
a
judgment
against
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
had
a
voice
if
you
hadn't
been
gone.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you'd
go,
just
take
your
--
all
of
your
case
on
the
idea
that
the
judgment
would
be
bad
in
that
count.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
it
have
been
binding
if
you'd
raised
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you'd
raised
it,
it
would've
been
binding.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
accident
happen
in
dekalb
county?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
happen
in
dekalb
county
or
it
hadn't
happen
in
dekalb
county?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
under
the
law
of
alabama,
as
i
recall
it,
that's
the
county
that
had
jurisdiction.
that
court
had
jurisdiction
of
the
case
of
an
injury,
to
cover
an
injury
that
happened
in
alabama.
justice
hugo
l.
black
its
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and,
we
don't
know
whether
it
did
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
know
that
it
didn't
adopt
it,
just
as
mr.
justice
brennan
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
had
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
of
course,
the
alabama
had
a
right.
i
don't
know
if
we
have
to
reach
it,
but
it
had
a
right
to
try
and
say,
“we'll
just
adopt
it
and
say
that
the
act
that
happened
in
alabama
in
dekalb
county
and
we'll
give
a
remedy
on
this,”
and
we'll
measure
the
damages
by
what
you
would
have
gotten
under
the
georgia
law,
whatever
it
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
singleton
case
the
last
one
that
was
decided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
this
when
your
judgment
shows
that
the
defendant's
first
filed
an
answer,
filed
an
appeal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
through
a
lawyer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
later
on,
on
the
day,
the
lawyer
came
up
and
withdrew.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
took
and
prove
that
the
company
knew
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
then
said
it
entered
under
the
judgment
by
default
heard
damages
with
reference
to
the
injuries
and
found
that
they
were
totally
permanent
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
rendered
a
judgment
for
$10,500.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
all
your
judgment
shows.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
i'm
talking
about
is
that
it
doesn't
refer
to
the
law
or
anything
else.
it
just
says
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
reference
to
the
georgia
law
was
that
you
want
to
recover
the
amount
that
would
have
been
recoverable
under
georgia
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
your
sole
reference
to
it,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
see
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
it
came
up,
the
dissenting
opinion
in
that
case
in
a
footnote,
footnote
15,
it
said
constitution
requiring
blind
and
unfair
application
of
the
internal
law,
the
place
of
making,
which
he
was
talking
about
a
contract
of
course,
is
a
return
to
that
outmoded
and
territorial
and
vested
rights
theories
of
conflicts
of
laws
long
ago
outgrown
by
our
jurisprudence.
i
maintain
that
georgia
had
no
vested
rights
in
this
administrative
right.
it's
different
than
the
federal
laws
where
the
federal
law
is
supreme
law
and
it's
not
analogous
to
the
state
versus
state.
that
is
all.
thanks.
