mr.
max
c.
pope
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
max
c.
pope
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appreciate
the
indulgence
ago
for
letting
me
argue
this
case
pro
hac
vice
and
i
hope
you're
not
ashamed
of
it
or
you
ordered
before
you
get
food,
before
i
get
the
food.
as
i
see
this
case,
there
are
two
issues
under
the
facts
that
i'm
about
to
recite.
can
a
state
create
a
transitory
cause
of
action
and
so
restrict
it
that
only
the
state
that
created
it
can
enforce
this
cause
of
action?
the
answer
--
the
obvious
answer
to
this
is,
no.
however,
this
no
is
qualified
by
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
which
is
the
next
issue
and,
as
i
see
it,
the
only
issue
that
this
court
has
to
decide.
did
the
alabama
court,
in
enforcing
the
georgia
statute,
violate
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution?
petitioner
was
awarded
a
judgment
in
a
trial
court
in
alabama
and
the
said
judgment
was
based
on
the
georgia
workman's
compensation
law.
this
was
a
default
judgment.
no
appeal
was
taken
from
this
judgment.
this
was
in
february
of
1959.
we
filed
a
complaint
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
alabama
against
the
respondent
here
who
was
the
insurance
carrier
of
the
defendant
in
the
alabama
trial
court.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
i
was
not
associated
in
this
case
until
there
was
--
until
i
filed
the
complaint
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
max
c.
pope
it
was
--
right
sir.
it
was
filed
in
the
court.
that
is
not
in
the
record
here,
but
we
might
as
well
bring
it
all
out
that
it
was
not
--
it's
not
in
the
record
before
the
court.
it
is
in
the
respondent's
brief,
but
--
that
this
--
we
are
--
i'm
willing
to
discuss
that
aspect
of
it.
but
there
was
a
bill
filed
in
the
court.
it
was
taken
a
nonsuit
and
we
filed
the
bill
--
the
bill
in
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
max
c.
pope
that's
the
way
i
understand
it.
mr.
max
c.
pope
right,
sir.
their
motion
to
dismiss
was
filed
in
the
federal
court.
this
motion
was
granted.
we
appealed
to
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
they
affirmed
the
trial
court.
we
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
and
it
was
granted
in
may
of
1964.
as
i
understand
the
alaska
packers
case,
which
is
this
court's
decision,
there
was
a
conflict
between
the
alaska
compensation
act
and
the
compensation
act
of
california.
the
petitioner
or
the
plaintiff
was
injured
in
alaska
and
this
court
held
that
in
so
awarding
in
california
compensation
even
though
he
was
injured
and
was
covered
by
alaska
compensation,
they
held
in
that
case
that
the
compensation
acts
of
either
jurisdiction,
consistently
with
due
process,
could
be
applied
in
either
state.
then
a
later
case,
pacific
employers
versus
industrial
accident
commission
was
also
involved,
the
california
industrial
commission,
which
also
would
involve
the
massachusetts
compensation
act.
and
they
reiterated
that
principle
and
it
said
either
state
would
be
free
to
enforce
and
adopt
the
remedy
provided
by
the
statute
of
the
other
state.
now,
in
this
ca
--
this
court's,
one
of
their
more
recent
decisions
is
the
carroll
versus
lanza
case
in
1954.
and
in
any
of
this
opinion,
the
court
said
the
pacific
employers
insurance
case
teaches
the
corollary
form
which
would
be
alabama
in
my
case,
can
displace
the
entire
foreign
compensation
act
or
they
could
supplement
it.
they
can
supplement
it.
in
that
case,
in
the
carroll
versus
lanza
case,
the
plaintiff
was
injured
in
arkansas.
he
was
employed
in
arkansas.
he
was
granted
benefits
under
the
missouri
compensation
act.
then,
he
filed
a
common
law
action
in
arkansas
and
this
court
held
that
it
was
permissive
for
the
arkansas
to
disregard
the
entire
compensation
act
of
missouri
and
give
him
his
common
law
or
common
law
remedy
in
arkansas.
it
did
not
violate
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
for
arkansas
to
displace
the
entire
compensation
act.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
they
disregarded
the
entire
law.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
not
--
not
in
this
compensation
act.
georgia
has
so
held
that
they
--
their
remedy
cannot
be
enforced
in
its
courts.
you're
right
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
it
can
by
review.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that's
the
correct
procedure.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
there
are
only
a
few
states
that
have
a
direct
court
action
and
alabama
is
one
of
those
states.
mr.
max
c.
pope
right,
sir,
right
sir.
the
--
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes
sir.
and
i
--
mr.
max
c.
pope
right
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
well
--
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir,
but
the
fact
that
the
court
of
a
sister
state
does
not
have
jurisdiction
of
its
own
cause
of
action.
this
court
held
in
tci
versus
george
which
involved
the
alabama
versus
georgia
court
decision
that
they
reversed,
alabama
had
a
provision
that
this
could
only
be
enforced
in
alabama.
and
this
court
held
that
the
statutes
of
a
sister
state,
jurisdiction
is
not
determined
by
the
law
of
the
court,
it's
determined
by
the
law
of
the
court's
creation
and
cannot
be
defeated
by
the
exterritorial
operation
of
a
statute
of
a
sister
state
even
though
that
statute
created
the
cause
of
action.
if
it
cannot
defeat
the
jurisdiction,
this
provision,
this
administrative
procedure
or
procedural
right,
and
under
the
georgia
law,
cannot
defeat
the
jurisdiction
of
the
alabama
court.
mr.
max
c.
pope
no,
sir.
this
--
you
mean
the
geor
--
mr.
max
c.
pope
the
tci
where
it
was
--
similarly
it
was
an
employee's
right
when
he
was
injured
by
defective
machinery.
it
was
not
under
the
death
statute.
mr.
max
c.
pope
right,
yes,
sir.
and,
they
held
in
that
case.
now
go
--
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
it
had
--
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
that's
--
mr.
max
c.
pope
that's
one
of
the
cases,
very
much,
so
that
it
could
not
deprive
--
this
georgia
statute
could
not
deprive
the
jurisdiction
of
the
alabama
court,
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
that
this
--
this
court
in
my
opinion,
in
the
carroll
versus
lanza
case
it
so
said
that,
sir,
when
it
said
that
it
could
disregard
the
entire
compensation
act
or
it
could
supplement
it
and
i
don't
know
what
the
word
“supplement”
mean,
but
i
would
assume
that
it
would
mean
add
something
to
it,
and
i
think
it
add
no
more
than
a
way
to
enforce
--
enforce
this
cause
of
action.
in
my
case,
and
also
in
the
carroll
versus
lanza
case,
it
said
missouri--
talking
about
missouri
which
would
be
out,
it
said
it
could
make
its
compensation
act
exclusive
in
its
own
courts
and
enforce
it
as
it
sh
--
as
it
was
--
as
it
please,
but
when
this
right
was
extended
to
other
states,
different
considerations
come
into
play.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
right.
mr.
max
c.
pope
well,
i
admit
--
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes.
well,
and
insofar
as
stated,
it
indicates
that
nowhere
that
this
man
--
in
this
case,
the
defendant
withdrew
from
this
case
and
the
plaintiff
was
put
on
a
horns
of
dilemma.
he
did
not
know
what
to
do.
the
court
--
this
is
not
in
the
record,
but
this
is
the
aspects
of
the
case.
there
are
certain
other
parts
noted
who
put
on
the
horns
of
dilemma
of
what
to
do.
they
came
up
with
the
insurance
policy
that
only
provided
for
insurance.
this
--
this
is
the
essence
of
it.
it
only
provided
for
insurance
under
the
state
of
georgia.
if
this
man
had
an
alabama
judgment
based
on
alabama
law,
it
wouldn't
be
worth
the
paper
it
was
written
on
it.
this
is
it.
this
court
held
in
alaska
packers
case
that
the
--
this
was
not
a
workmen's
compensation
case
was
not
a
tort
action.
it
was
--
it
was
an
incident
of
doing
business.
there
was
a
promise
that
they
would
--
that
their
employer
would
compensate
a
man
when
he
was
injured
and
the
statute
--
the
states,
in
passing
these
statutes
merely
sanctioned
this
problem.
and
it's
the
instant
of
doing
business
and
it
comes
out
of
the
realms
a
little
bit
of
the
regular
conflict
of
laws
and
each
state
has
it's
--
that
is
one
of
the
things
i
think
the
carroll
versus
lanza
case
turns
on.
as
i
said,
it
says
different
consideration
or
different
--
as
this
court
has
expressed
in
the
very
recent
case
of
clay
versus
sun
insurance
company
that
the
significant
context
that
the
court's
other
form
has
a
governmental
interest
that
they
have
a
right
to
protect.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
was
injured
in
alabama.
the
defendant
was
doing
business
in
the
state
of
alabama.
and
the
state
of
alabama
has
an
interest
in
protecting
injured
employees
that
are
injured
within
its
boundaries.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
yes
sir.
i‘ve
come
up
on
that
clause
and
i
have
it
in
my
pocket
and
i
--
the
reason
is
not
in
the
record.
we've
been
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
ever
since
i've
been
in
the
case,
and
we
haven't
had
any
time
to
discover
to
get
in
--
mr.
max
c.
pope
no,
sir.
it
would
not
preclude
it,
but
what
i'm
trying
to
say,
the
judgment
would
be
no
good.
mr.
max
c.
pope
right.
mr.
max
c.
pope
--
were
rendered
under
alabama
law,
(voice
overlap)
right.
mr.
max
c.
pope
he's
insolvent,
sir.
that's
--
and
that's
the
reason
they
withdrew
from
the
case,
that
they
--
what
i've
assumed
that
they
were
insolvent
and
it
was
in
--
i
don't
know
how
they
came
up
on
this
injured
company
as
i
said.
i
did
not
handle
the
case
in
the
trial
court
and
i
do
not
know,
but
this
is
what
i
have
assumed.
in
--
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
it
--
where
it
was
a
diversity.
it
does
business
in
alabama
and
green
we
had
federal
court
jurisdiction
as
they
--
mr.
max
c.
pope
on
zurich,
yes,
sir.
and
now,
the
defendant,
in
their
recent
case,
it
was
substituted
service.
it
was
substituted
service.
in
fact,
they
were
doing
business
under
the
provision
of
alabama
statute.
now,
it
--
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
right.
mr.
max
c.
pope
right.
mr.
max
c.
pope
this
is
a
transitory
cause
of
action.
sir,
as
i
understand,
a
transitory
cause
of
action,
it
is
a
cause
of
action
that
can
happen
any
place.
a
local
action
would
be
one
like
trespass
the
land.
it
could
only
happen
where
a
person
want
to
cross
that
land.
this
person
could
be
injured
in
alaska
and
his
cause
of
action
would
occur.
there
is
a
transitory
cause
of
action
that
could
occur
any
place
that
he
was
covered
under
the
georgia
law,
and
this
is
the
reason
i
say
this
is
a
transitory
cause
of
action.
this
is
one
of
the
bad
aspects
of
this
thing.
true
enough,
this
is
only
a
neighboring
state
of
alabama
and
georgia
right
next
door,
but
if
this
employer
had
taken
this
man
to
alaska
and
he
had
become
bedridden
and
injured
up
there,
would
he
be
forced
to
go
all
the
way
back
and
exhaust
his
administrative
remedy
all
the
way
back
to
georgia?
i
don't
think
the
decision
of
this
court
takes
it
that
far,
and
that's
the
result
we'll
reach
if
this
--
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
reversed
in
this
thing.
it's
the
application
it
has
to
the
whole
thing
is
preventing
a
state
--
a
foreign
state
to
protect
its
citizens
that
are
injured
within
its
boundaries.
mr.
max
c.
pope
sir?
mr.
max
c.
pope
in
the
georgia
case?
mr.
max
c.
pope
but
the
court
said
it
did
not
violate
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
in
ignoring
this
part
of
the
georgia
law.
i
mean,
that's
the
way
i
read
it,
i
assume
it's
the
only
thing
that
you
have
in
court.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
this
is
in
another
court,
but
in
a
circuit
court
in
alabama,
yes
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
right.
mr.
max
c.
pope
well,
that
it
--
mr.
max
c.
pope
right.
mr.
max
c.
pope
they
refused
to
enforce
the
judgment,
but
not
the
cause
of
action.
mr.
max
c.
pope
well,
mr.
etheredge
might
as
well
bring
the
rest.
he
--
he
contends
that
the
singleton
versus
hope
engineering
company
is
the
case
that
calls
it
out.
there's
no
--
i
have
not
seen
any
opinion.
the
only
thing
in
the
opposite
trial
court
was
sustained
with
pleas
and
demurrers
and
what
the
judge
used
as
basis
of
it,
i
do
not
know.
but,
in
the
singleton
versus
hope
engineering
case,
the
defendant
was
injured
in
georgia,
and
the
alabama
court
said
it
was
a
common
law
cause
of
action.
and
in
that
case,
this
is
--
i
want
to
finish
it
but
i
--.
mr.
max
c.
pope
that's
right.
i
won't
answer.
mr.
max
c.
pope
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
one
of
the
most
distinguishing
characters
in
this
question
that's
been
raised
is
singleton
versus
hope
engineering
company,
our
words,
as
i
say,
it
was
a
default
judgment.
the
law
in
alabama,
and
it
says
as
i
quote
from
the
kilberg
versus
southern
auto
insurance
company,
said
it's
almost
universally
held
that
where
there
is
no
proof
of
the
law
of
another
state,
it
will
be
presumed
that
the
law
of
the
forum
in
which
the
issue
is
being
tried
is
the
law
of
the
state
on
the
question
involved.
in
our
case,
there
was
no
proof
of
this
administrative
procedure
of
the
georgia
law.
in
the
singleton
versus
hope
engineering
company,
there
was
a
demurrer
filed
to
a
common
law
action
alleging
the
georgia
law
in
alabama
courts,
contrary
to
the
federal
courts,
federal
courts
take
judicial
notice
of
all
the
states
law.of
course,
one
--
i
heard
one
judge
say
that
he
may
take
judicial
notice
of
it.
he'd
like
to
have
his
recollection
refreshed.
however,
in
this
case,
there
was
no
pleading
of
the
georgia
statute
as
a
defense
or
any
provisions
of
it
as
a
defense
to
deprive
the
alabama
court
of
any
type
of
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
mr.
max
c.
pope
the
substantive
part
of
it
was
pre
--
pleaded,
yes,
sir.
you're
right,
sir,
but
--
mr.
max
c.
pope
i
don't
think
so.
there
are
different
statutes
involved
in
it
and
i
think
if
they
pleaded
one
statute,
i
don't
think
that
the
--
the
mere
pleading
of
one
statute
would
bring
them
all
in.
they
don't
take
--
the
alabama
court
does
not
take
judicial
notice
of
sister
state
statutes
unless
they
are
proved
under
the
procedure
outlined
in
the
alabama
act.
mr.
max
c.
pope
you're
exactly
right,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
well,
that's
it,
but
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
the
answer
to
the
singleton
versus
hope
insur
--
engineering
company
that
there
was
no
alleged
georgia
law
as
a
defense
to
this
cause
of
action
and
it
was
presumed,
as
some
of
the
justices
have
said
that
they
took
and
as
the
pearson
case
also
said,
that
new
york
took
the
corpus
of
the
massachusetts
law
and
adopted
it
as
its
own
law.
this
is
what
--
this
is
what
in
the
essence
it
did
in
that
case.
and
also
in
the
pearson
case,
in
an
answer
to
this
argument
about
the
remedy,
and
all
of
this
stuff
is
so
inseparable
that
it
cannot
be
separated,
the
court
in
the
pearson
case
said
we
are
directed
to
no
precedent
and
are
unaware
of
any
compelling
logic
in
the
defending
a
precedent
which
requires
a
state
to
enforce
such
a
statutory
qualification
whenever
it
chooses
to
enforce
a
foreign
cause
of
action.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
not
in
--
mr.
max
c.
pope
well,
the
georgia
statute
is
made
up
into
several
different
section
in
my
opinion
and,
according
to
statute
--
title
7
of
429
of
the
alabama
act,
“on
proving
statutes
of
other
states,
you
have
got
to
have
an
expert
or
this
statute
has
got
to
be
filed
on
record
in
the
secretary
of
state's
office
and
this
has
got
to
be
certified
to
the
court
or
an
expert
on
the
law
of
that
state.”
now,
the
attorney
that
represented
the
petitioner
in
the
trial
court,
i
don't
know
whether
he
was
an
expert
on
the
law.
oh,
i
do
not
know
whether
he
knew
the
whole
law
and
i
just
--
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
you
have
to
prove
damages
under
a
default
judgment.
this
is
one
of
the
requisites
of
a
default
judgment.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
i
--
mr.
max
c.
pope
my
idea
is
that
if
it
does
not,
the
--
it
was
not
upon
the
petitioner
to
prove
a
defense
that
could
be
set
up
possibly
against
him.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
i
--
well,
--
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
yes
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
yes
sir.
i
--
in
this
case,
the
georgia
statute
says,
where
a
person
is
totally
disabled
and
the
judgment
recites
that
he
was
totally
disable,
they
have
a
compensation
where
he
can
be
awarded
a
lump
sum
of
$10,000.
and
in
this
case,
he
was
awarded
a
lump
sum
judgment.
i
cannot
see
where
the
respondent
has
been
injured
in
this
matter.
the
judgment
was
rendered.
they
did
not
appeal.
they
did
not
raise
these
jurisdictional
matters
in
the
court,
and
the
alabama
court
does
not
take
judicial
notice
of
its
sister
state
statute
and
they
can
only
be
proven
as
set
out
in
the
alabama
statute.
now,
my
brother
raises
the
tci
versus
george
case.
the
dictum,
and
it
says
where
the
right
and
remedy
are
so
inseparable,
and
this
rule
came
from
the
pollard
versus
bailey
case
which
arose.
it
was
not
a
diversity
case.
it
was
a
diversity
case
in
the
federal
district
court
in
mobile,
alabama.
in
that
case,
there
was
involved
the
stockholder's
liability
to
the
bank's
creditors
and
it
all
depended
on
the
interpretation
of
the
charter
of
the
bank.
and
in
this
case,
this
was
before
in
the
federal
courts
that
the
law
and
equity
were
merged
and
in
that
case,
this
was
a
law
action
and
this
court
said
that
the
stockholders
were
liable
a
pro
rata
share
of
their
stock
as
to
the
amount
of
debts.
and
they
said
there
was
only
one
of
them
before
the
court.
it
had
to
be
in
equity
where
they
could
all
be
enjoined
and
they
--
be
joined
in
accounting
and
there
could
be
an
accountant
to
determine
the
pro
rata
share,
and
this
is
where
that
rule
arose.
now,
in
any
of
the
other
cases,
they
cite
this
rule
in
the
tci
versus
george
case
but
it
does
not
follow.
it
cites
it
as
a
proposition.
it's
only
dictum,
and
this
other
case
is
not
in
context
with.
and
the
pearson
case
is
just
--
the
opinion
in
that
case
is
so
well
written
and
judge
kaufman
says
in
that
case,
he
was
referring
to
the
alaska
packers
case,
he
said
the
court,
talking
about
the
supreme
court,
expressly
recognize
that
rights
asserted
under
the
statute
of
one
state
may
be
necessarily
denied
or
qualified
by
the
law
of
another
state.
now,
the
law
in
alabama
is,
when
you're
injured,
when
you're
entitled
to
compensation,
that
the
way
to
enforce
it
is
in
the
circuit
courts
in
alabama.
and
this
is
what
the
alabama
court
did.
they
used
the
old
rule
that
the
forum
state
uses
its
own
procedure
and
uses
the
substantive
law
of
the
forum
state.
now,
judge
kaufman
said
he
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
this
legal
tort,
that
it
was
the
result
to
speak
the
loudest
to
him
that
the
person
was
entitled
to
their
money
and
there
was
no
--
no
policy
reasons
or
the
court
of
the
forum
not
to
give
it
to
him.
now,
mr.
--
the
carroll
versus
lanza
case,
in
this
case,
this
court,
when
it
handed
down
this
opinion,
they
said,
true
enough,
this
is
not
--
the
facts
are
not
just
exactly
alike
but,
they
said,
“for
we
write
not
only
for
this
case
and
this
day
alone,
but
for
this
type
of
case.”
and
in
this
case,
this
is
the
same
type
case
as
the
carroll
versus
lanza
case
and
here,
the
only
difference
and
we
as
--
trying
to
get
affirmative
relief
and
not
raising
it
in
--
the
petitioner
--
the
respondent
has
not
raised
it
as
a
defense.
and
i
just
can't
see
how
the
words
in
the
carroll
versus
lanza
case
does
not
authorize
the
alabama
courts
even
though
that
the
matter
had
been
raised
as
a
proper
defense,
which
i
say
it
was
not,
even
though
it
had
been
raised,
the
carroll
versus
lanza
case
authorizes
the
alabama
court
to
ignore,
if
they
can
displace
the
entire
queries
of
land
to
be
drawn.
if
--
mr.
max
c.
pope
well,
i
--
mr.
max
c.
pope
i
made
that
assertion,
if
the
facts
in
singleton
versus
hope
were
the
same
here,
sir.
it
was
a
common
law
action
in
singleton
versus
hope
and
the
demurrer
was
filed
alleging
the
georgia
law,
and
the
--
another
thing,
another
policy
reason
in
this,
the
defendant
in
that
case
was
a
georgia
corporation,
also
the
accident
happened
in
georgia.
i
don't
know.
the
record
doesn't
disclose
in
that
case
whether
the
person
was
a
resident
of
the
state
of
alabama
and
--
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
right,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
it
in
--
it
indicates
that,
except
the
one
fact
there
was
a
common
law
action
in
this.
now,
i
would
agree
that
the
language
in
the
case
singleton
versus
hope
does
advance
that
proposition,
but
the
facts
are
not
the
same.
if
the
facts
were
the
same,
i
would
say
that
would
be
the
law
but
it
is
not.
the
facts
are
different.
it's
a
common
law
action.
and
here,
this
is
the
compensation
act.
the
facts,
to
me,
are
different.
i
--
mr.
max
c.
pope
well,
i
see
your
logic
behind
it.
however,
i
think
the
singleton
versus
hope
case
is
more
important
with
the
carroll
versus
lanza
case
and
it
was
a
1931
case
which
is
a
good
time
beyond
that,
but
it
was
a
common
law
action
in
both
cases.
in
alabama,
they
decided
to
recognize
the
exclusive
effect
of
the
georgia
statute
in
the
singleton
versus
hope
case,
which
they
did
not
in
the
carroll
versus
lanza
case
and
i
think
the
alabama
court
did
not
violate
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
by
not
applying
the
georgia
provision
of
the
georgia
statute.
and
mainly,
that's
the
only
issue
for
this
court
to
determine.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes
sir,
on
the
--
on
this
one
issue,
19
--
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
mr.
max
c.
pope
i
believe
it
does.
as
mr.
etheredge
said,
i
believe
it
does
provide
for
some
attorney's
fees.
mr.
max
c.
pope
well,
i
see
--
i
think
you
are
right
in
the
view
of
the
pearson
case.
in
other
words,
it
looked
like
alabama
could
just
adopt
it
and
say
the
georgia
law
is
the
alabama
law
in
this
case.
however,
i
think
the
procedure
in
alabama
is,
like
mr.
etheredge
said,
i
think
it
is
as
the
complaint
has
alleged
and
you
take
a
judgment,
so
to
speak,
on
that
complaint.
this
will
be
my
understanding
of
it.
however,
i
think,
according
to
the
pearson
case,
it
could
be
said
that
the
only
thing
alabama
did
was
to
say
the
georgia
law
is
the
alabama
law.
this
is
the
way
we're
going
to
enforce
it.
we
do
not
violate
any
law
--
any
federal
law.
we
do
not
deprive
the
petitioner
--
the
respondent
of
any
due
process
or
any
rights
he
has
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
max
c.
pope
yes,
sir.
that
was
--
mr.
max
c.
pope
that
was
the
sole
reference.
mr.
max
c.
pope
that
was
the
sole
reference
to
it.
in
--
in
its
--
i
think
one
thing
about
the
pearson
case
that
brings
it
up
and
also
the
babcock
versus
jackson
case
which
is
a
new
york
case,
it
came
out.
judge
fuld,
in
that
case,
said
that
to
give
regard
--
give
any
thought
to
this
recognizing
part
of
it
and
denying
part
of
it,
he
said
it
would
give
rise
or
give
--
we
would
have
to
raise
the
relics
of
the
vested
rights
theory.
in
a
dissent
in
the
clay
insurance
case,
when
it
first
came
up
the
first
time
from
the
fifth
circuit
--
