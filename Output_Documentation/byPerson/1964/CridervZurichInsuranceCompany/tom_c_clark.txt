c.

there,
though,
they
did
not
apply
the
law
--
the
compensation
law.
they
applied
the
common
law.
justice
tom
c.
clark
you're
applying
--
you're
trying
to
take
the
benefit
of
the
georgia
law,
aren't
you?
justice
tom
c.
clark
except
its
procedural
position.
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
there,
can
you
go
into
court
at
all
in
georgia?
justice
tom
c.
clark
even
the
review
or
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
in
texas,
you
go
into
the
board
and
then
you
go
into
the
court.
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
that
the
same
for
georgia?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
have
to
exhaust
your
administrative
remedy
first.
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
then,
you
had
georgia
on
review.
in
georgia,
you
go
into
the
court
on
review.
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
is
de
novo,
isn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
isn't
it
a
de
novo
trial?
justice
tom
c.
clark
not
like
ours
then.
justice
tom
c.
clark
it
depends
on
whether
the
parties
were
under
that
statute
jurisdiction.
justice
tom
c.
clark
here,
they
were
under
the
georgia
statute,
as
well
as
the
alabama
but
they
adopted
the
alaba
--
the
georgia
law
as
alabama
law
and
abide
it.
justice
tom
c.
clark
can
you
say
that's
against
the
federal
clause
as
announced
by
the
supreme
court
if
you
didn't
appear.
you
were
legally
served,
were
you
not?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
they
rejected
this
procedure
but
adopted
the
statute.
justice
tom
c.
clark
so
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
statute
is
there
or
not,
does
it?
