mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
pertains
to
the
application
--
issuance
and
execution
of
a
search
warrant
on
the
two
texas
anti-communist
laws
and
at
a
time
subsequent,
subsequent
to
the
time
when
the
federal
government
had
first
entered
the
field
of
prohibited
activities
and
had
ordered
the
petitioner
in
this
case
john
stanford
to
register
under
the
subversive
activities
control
act
of
1954.
the
search
took
place
in
his
home
private
residence
where
he
conducted
a
mail
order
bookstore
called
all
points
of
view,
over
2000
books,
pamphlets,
lists,
and
letters
were
taken
from
the
petitioner's
home.
now
the
two
texas
sedition
laws
at
question
is
first
the
texas
communist
control
law
that
says
in
its
preamble
that
texas
is
a
place
where
there
are
many
vital
military
installations
and
texas
is
a
place
where
there
are
many
products
for
national
defense
and
it
sets
out
--
then
it
sets
out
the
criminal
acts.
if
you
remain
in
texas
five
days,
you
must
be
--
if
you're
a
communist
you
must
register.
if
you're
engage
in
sabotage
against
the
united
states
or
the
--
or
of
texas
you're
then
subject
to
criminal
punishment.
the
next
texas
law
involved
is
the
texas
suppression
act
of
1954.
section
1
in
the
form
of
the
preamble
describes
the
international
conspiracy
of
communism
as
directed
against
the
united
states
and
the
“several
states”
and
then
finally
against
the
state
of
texas.
and
this
makes
it
prime
to
attempt
to
overthrow
the
united
states
or
texas,
to
advocate
such
doctrine,
to
conspire,
to
commit
such
acts,
to
support
or
be
a
member
of
an
organization
which
engages
in
such
act.
the
law
so
states
that
the
communist
party
cannot
be
on
the
ballot
in
the
communist
party
is
outlawed
in
the
state
of
texas.
now,
then
we
get
to
section
9
of
the
texas
suppression
act
and
this
in
--
the
most
vital
part
of
this
case.
it
says
section
9
that
a
search
warrant
maybe
issued
showing
to
describe
premises
as
they
please
where
some
specified
--
some
specified
phase
or
phases
are
being
violated
or
are
violated
in
showing
--
in
repeating
this
phase,
were
showing
a
violation
of
some
phase
or
phases
of
this
act.
the
affidavit
who
is
supporting
the
search
warrant
were
signed
by
mr.
v.
murray
jordan
and
lonny
f.
zwiener
both
of
whom
are
assistant
attorney
generals
of
texas.
after
naming
stanford
in
their
affidavit,
they
stated
that
his
home
poses
a
place
where
books
etcetera
concerning
the
communist
party,
books
concerning
the
communist
party
of
texas
and
the
operation
in
the
communist
party
of
texas
are
unlawfully
possessed
in
the
violation
of
these
two
texas
statutes.
now
here
it
should
be
noted
that
not
one
phase
of
either
of
these
two
texas
laws
was
mentioned
that
this
man
allegedly
was
violated.
they
based
their
beliefs
they
said
on
this
case,
“recent
mailings
by
stanford
on
12,
december
1963
a
material
from
his
home.
such
material
being
identified
as
pro-communist
and
they
did
not
define
what
this
norm
--
they
did
not
provide
a
norm
or
standards
on
what
is
pro-communist."
they
said
what
he
was
mailing
out
of
his
home
was
pro-communist.
then
they
had
the
application
for
the
search
warrant
signed
by
mr.
barlow
who
carried
along
the
language
of
the
affidavit
and
then
he
stated
to
mr.
barlow
the
district
attorney
who
will
speak
to
you
shortly,
stated
that
his
belief
was
founded
on
the
following
information,
“that
this
officer
had
received
information
from
two
credible
persons
that
the
party
named
above
has
such
books
and
records
in
his
possession
which
are
books
and
records
of
the
communist
party
that
such
information
as
recent
or
again
has
been
confirmed
by
recent
mailings
by
stanford
on
december
the
12,
1963,
a
pro-communist
material."
again
they
do
not
describe
or
set
out
any
norm
or
standard
as
to
what
they
mean
by
the
term
pro-communist.
then
district
judge
solomon
casseb
jr.
issued
his
order
whom
in
--
to
pick
up
the
books,
records,
pamphlets
"concerning
the
communist
party
of
texas
and
the
operations
of
the
communist
party
of
texas."
now
on
december
26th,
your
honors,
1963
which
is
a
day
before
this
texas
warrant
was
issued
and
acted
upon
a
u.s.
marshall
jessie
dobb
served
an
order
on
mr.
stanford
to
register
under
the
u.s.
subversive
activities
control
act.
by
this
time
--
by
the
time
stanford
had
been
served
with
this
texas
warrant
he
had
already
had
a
hearing
before
the
federal
authority.
the
next
day
and
this
is
in
the
record
because
we
moved
it
in
the
evidence.
it
had
been
the
headlines
in
the
san
antonio
paper.
the
screaming
headline
in
the
san
antonio
news,
admit
red
ties,
san
antonio
man
ordered,
and
so
there
wasn't
many
secret
about
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
had
first
entered
the
field
of
prohibited
activity.
now
your
honors
if
i
may
i
would
like
to
refer
some
of
the
testimony
that
took
place
at
the
hearings
to
determine
to
the
validity
of
this
search
warrant.
first
of
all,
i
would
bring
your
attention
the
testimony
of
john
good
jr.
--
mr.
john
good
jr.,
he
was
first
assistant
district
attorney
in
1949
and
1950.
he
said
that
either
in
1949
or
1950,
at
the
request
of
then
governor
allan
shivers
of
texas.
they
called
stanford
into
the
office
of
district
--
to
the
office
of
district
attorney
and
they
asked
him
about
his
activities.
they
didn't
do
anything
about
it.
mr.
good
in
his
testimony
said
to
mr.
barlow,
“you
have
a
file
on
him
mr.
barlow”.
but
13
years
later
and
several
weeks
after
the
federal
government
enacted
and
one
day
after
the
u.s.
marshal
had
served
this
man
a
process
then
and
only
then
that
the
state
of
texas
moved
against
this
man.
now
we
get
to
the
witness
e.l.
ritchie,
the
assistant
county
clerk
in
charge
of
“assumed
name”
section.
he
got
on
and
testified
that
mr.
stanford
operated
the
business
in
his
home.
it
qualified
with
all
the
local
laws
within
his
all
points
of
view
and
then
at
that
particular
time,
in
time
of
the
hearing
time
--
the
time
of
the
search
warrant,
he
was
acting
in
accordance
with
“assumed
name”
statute
of
barrett
county.
now
as
to
the
search
itself
i
would
like
to
quote
something
from
the
witness
charles
neil.
mr.
neil
is
a
retired
fbi
agent
and
he
states
that
on
december
the
27th
about
3
pm
they
went
into
mr.
stanford's
home
and
stayed
about
five
hours.
he
testified
that
the
office
of
attorney
general
of
texas
alone
not
the
district
attorney
but
the
attorney
general
alone
decided
what
books
would
be
taken
out,
his
office,
his
representatives
that
a
number
of
items
were
taken
from
stanford's
home
which
was
not
listed
on
the
--
under
the
inventory,
but
under
the
texas
code
of
criminal
procedures
they
must
be
listed
under
the
inventory.
that
nothing
was
found
in
stanford's
home
that
was
capable
of
committing
any
act
of
physical
violence.
that
private
correspondence
between
stanford
and
his
american
civil
liberties
union
attorney
in
houston
texas
was
seized
and
taken
away
by
the
police.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
he
--
his
wife
was
there
at
beginning.
she
called
her
husband
and
then
he
came
out.
he
was
there,
the
press
was
there,
the
t.v.
was
there
--
well
--
it's
well
represented
your
honor,
the
--
many
people
are
in
the
house.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
five
hours,
yes
sir.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
no
sir,
i
will
get
on
to
that.
the
--
i
will
--
i'm
going
to
quote
to
you
later
on
if
i
may
the
statement
of
the
district
attorney
that
they're
waiting
to
see
what
this
court
does,
they
want
to
take
him
back
and
get
him
indicted
and
put
him
in
the
texas
penitentiary
if
they
can.
this
is
what
--
this
one
of
the
things
that's
being
held
in
advance
at
the
moment.
they
then
picked
up
the
private
correspondents
between
stanford
and
his
defense
committee
in
new
york
city,
which
is
representing
him
on
the
subversive
activities
control
act.
they
took
his
correspondents
the
way
that
he
--
with
his
committee.
they
took
away
stanford's
marriage
license.
they
took
away
his
blue
shield
policy,
they
took
away
his
automobile
license,
they
took
away
his
honorable
discharge
from
the
navy
and
the
titled
papers
to
his
home.
alright,
now
the
inventory
that
was
going
on
to
this
inventory
reflected
that
hundreds
of
allegedly
seditious
books
and
pamphlets
were
taken
out
and
let
us
see
the
spread
of
books
that
were
taken
out,
there's
a
few
examples,
“soviet
power”
by
hewlett
johnson,
“what
is
to
be
done?”
by
v.i.
lenin,
“letters
from
prison”
by
eugene
dennis,
this
was
supposed
to
show
that
he
was
a
man
committing
a
law
against
--
a
violation
of
the
texas
sedition
laws,
“cuba
and
the
‘kennedy
plan'”
che
guevara,
“a
visit
to
cuba”
by
i.f.
stone,
“let
man
prevail”
by
eric
fromm,
“a
faithful
moment
in
our
history”
a
dissenting
opinion
by
justice
hugo
black,
19
copies
of
“pacem
in
terris”
by
pope
john
with
editorial
comment.
he
used
the
word
of
a
good
texan
who
passed
away
a
few
days
ago,
a
few
weeks
ago,
professor
j.
frank
dobie.
when
you
read
his
astounding
and
astonishing
inventory
that
they
--
of
things
that
they
took
away,
when
you
read
that,
you
can
see
the
elephant
and
you
can
hear,
do
you
know
that
--
you
can
hear
the
owl
hoot
because
there
just
isn't
any
questions
at
all
if
they
have
taken
away
things
like
letters,
marriage
license,
judicial
opinions,
all
as
an
example
of
fact
that
this
man
is
disloyal
to
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
well,
mr.
dobie
says
--
when
he
sees
something
like
this,
this
is
bad
as
this,
you
can
see
the
elephant
and
hear
the
owl
hoot.
that's
a
colloquial
--
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
--
expression
in
my
part
of
the
country
that
when
something's
really
bad,
you
can
see
the
elephant
and
hear
the
owl
hoot,
maybe
i'm
being
a
little
to
provincial
but
mr.
dobie
is
an
old
hero
of
mine
and
i
wanted
to
quote
him
before
this
court.
now
from
the
witness
lonny
zwiener,
assistant
attorney
general,
he
was
on
the
stand.
he
said
that
mr.
v.
murray
jordan,
assistant
attorney
general
made
the
choice
of
books
to
be
took
--
taken
out.
and
then
this
exchange
took
place,
question,
“alright
mr.
zwiener,
do
you
recall
any
single
object
taken
from
the
stanford
home
under
search
warrant
issued
by
judge
casseb
which
could
be
used
as
a
physical
object
of
violence
to
overthrow
the
united
states
of
america?”
answer,
“not
mr.
maverick,
unless
you
can
consider
throwing
hard
backs
books
--
hardback
books
to
the
people
--
at
people
like
a
weapon”.
now
then
came
on
the
young
assistant
attorney
general
of
texas,
v.
murray
jordan
in
1959,
graduate
of
the
university
of
texas.
he
stated
that
he
saw
books
and
publications
hostile
to
communism
in
the
stanford
home
but
refused
to
take
them
out.
now
this
exchange
took
place,
question,
“did
you
see
any
books
unsympathetic
to
the
communist?”
answer,
“yes,
sir”.
“why
didn't
you
take
those
out?”
answer,
“i
felt
my
position
there
wasn't
making
selection
as
to
what
comes
under
the
affidavit”.
question,
“the
affidavit
said
you
were
to
pick
up
books
concerning
communism.
that's
all
it
said
pick
up
books
concerning
communism”.
answer,
“well,
used
by
the
communist”.
question,
“it
says
concerning
the
communist
party,
why
wasn't
the
speech
by
the
late
john
f.
kennedy
denouncing
the
communist
party
taken?”
answer,
“denouncing
the
communist
party
doesn't
file
--
fall
into
mind
the
idea
the
definition
as
in
the
affidavit”.
question,
“what
does
the
title
of
the
bookstore,
all
points
of
view
mean
to
you
mr.
jordan?”
then
mr.
jordan
was
questioned
as
to
his
expertise
on
the
question
of
communism.
“did
you
have
any
studied
--
any
experience
in
the
university
of
texas
on
communism?”
“no”.
“did
you
have
any
experience
in
law
school
on
the
study
of
communism?”
“did
you
have
any
extensive
formal
training
in
the
navy
on
the
study
of
communism?”
“have
you
ever
had
any
training
extensively
in
the
field
of
communism?”
to
which
he
said
no.
so
here
was
the
person
that
the
state
of
texas
had
selected
to
protect
itself
against
this
international
conspiracy.
now,
mr.
stanford
then
filed
a
motion
to
declare
the
search
warrant
invalid
under
both
the
const
--
on
the
both
the
constitution
of
texas
and
the
united
states
of
america.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
it
was
his
home
and
in
his
home
he
had
a
private
library
and
he
had
a
mail-order
bookstore
and
in
the
transcript
of
the
record
you'll
see
in
the
back
where
transcripts
of
the
record,
you'll
see
in
the
back
where
he
would
mail
from
his
home
your
honor
various
books.
he's
on
a
mail-order
basis.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
it
was
not
a
retail
--
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
--
bookstore.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
no,
sir.
mail
order
bookstore,
there
isn't
any
question
about
that.
now
we
file
this
motion
to
set
aside
quashing
whole
for
naught
the
search
warrant
and
we
had
a
hearing,
an
extensive
hearing.
this
motion
was
denied.
mr.
barlow,
the
district
attorney,
the
criminal
district
attorney
of
barrett
county
now
entered
into
a
stipulation
in
the
courts
of
criminal
appeal
of
texas
and
so
declared
that
there
is
no
appeal
to
any
state
court
in
texas
from
a
motion
of
this
kind.
and
so
it's
on
that
basis
that
we
are
here
today.
now,
by
way
of
advanced
summary
so
to
speak,
i
would
like
if
i
may
go
through
these
and
then
come
back
and
expound
on
them.
it
is
our
contention
in
this
case
that
this
stanford
matter
should
be
reversed
for
the
following
reasons
because
the
two
texas
sedition
laws
have
been
superseded
by
the
federal
legislation.
because
the
two
texas
sedition
laws
as
applied
in
this
case
violated
petitioner's
rights
for
free
speech
as
protected
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment,
because
the
two
texas
sedition
laws
the
petitioner
was
denied
the
right
to
be
secured
in
his
home
against
unreasonable
search.
fourth,
because
the
petitioner
was
forced
to
give
evidence
against
himself
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment,
because
there
was
no
probable
cause
shown,
because
the
application
for
the
search
warrant,
the
warrant
itself
failed
to
specify
the
crime
charged
and
seventh,
because
the
warrant
failed
to
particularly
describe
the
things
to
be
seized
and
finally
because
of
the
two
texas
statutes
are
unconstitutionally
vague.
now,
i
want
to
quote
something
to
you
if
i
may
from
the
brief
of
mr.
barlow
and
this
is
--
as
i
see
it
as
a
part
as
an
advocate
for
this
man
stanford
before
this
court.
this
is
the
moment
of
truth
in
this
case
as
i
view
it.
let
me
quote
mr.
barlow's
brief,
the
state
of
--
and
this
is
in
his
brief
at
page
9,
“the
criminal
district
attorney
of
barrett
county
has
held
up
presentment
of
this
matter
to
the
grand
jury
for
indictment
of
this
petitioner
because
the
challenge
--
because
of
the
challenge
made
in
this
appeal,
and
because
of
the
important
questions
that
have
arisen.”
at
page
9
of
its
brief
of
the
state
of
texas,
it
is
stated,
“the
criminal
district
attorney
of
barrett
county,
texas
has
held
up
the
presentment
of
this
matter
to
the
grand
jury
because
of
the
challenge
made
in
this
case.
if
the
communist
control
and
suppression
acts
are
valid
enactments
and
their
provisions
are
unconstitutional,
this
petitioner
should
be
prosecuted
under
them.
it
is
the
opinion
of
the
officers
representing
the
state
statutes
that
these
acts
are
valid
and
constitutional.
then
finally
one
more
quote.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
yes,
sir.
page
9
--
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
of
the
brief
of
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
respondents?
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
and
now
perhaps
the
most
important
quotation
of
all
from
that
brief,
at
page
16
of
the
brief
of
the
state
of
texas,
what
the
problem
then
boils
down
to
is
this,
if
the
texas
statute
is
invalid
because
it
is
preempted
by
the
action
of
the
smith
and
mccarran
acts
then
the
search
in
this
case
is
illegal.
this
is
so
because
there
was
no
valid
statute
upon
which
it
could
be
based.
if
the
--
if
this
is
a
case
and
otherwise
and
any
--
if
this
is
the
case,
the
action
of
the
trial
court
should
be
reversed.
now,
i
want
to
--
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
oh
yes,
sir,
throughout,
i'll
go
into
it.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
well,
it's
attacked
on
it
on
the
basis
of
preemption
and
attacked
on
it
on
the
basis
of
violation
of
first
amendment.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
agreed
and
not
--
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
first
that
the
statutes
are
unconstitutional
or
preempted
into
that
even
assuming
that
the
statutes
were
constitutional
and
are
properly
written
from
--
as
turned
out
by
the
legislature
that
a
local
official
in
this
particular
instance
didn't
even
follow
their
own
law
because
of
section
9
of
those
two
laws
assuming
that
they're
constitutional,
say
that
you
must
specify
the
crime
that
he
committed,
they
didn't
do
it.
and
so
assuming
your
position
that
they
maybe
constitutional
they
didn't
even
comply
with
their
own
law
but
first
we
say
it's
unconstitutional.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
and
others.
now
may
i
--
i
want
to
go
into
that
now
if
i
may.
i
think
also
--
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
yes.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
sir?
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
yes
sir,
yes
sir,
both
ways.
and
this
is
a
thing
your
honors
that
i
want
to
particularly
--
i'm
pressing
on.
this
is
what
i
said
earlier
that
perhaps
the
most
important
point
in
this
case
and
mr.
barlow
had
joined
in
with
me
on
this,
he
hasn't
invoked
any
technicality
--
was
the
court
that
would
keep
us
from
facing
up
to
the
constitutionality
of
this
law.
he
had
joined
then.
he
has
said,
“well,
tell
me
whether
or
not
this
law
is
constitutional?”
the
state
of
texas
has
is
asked
for
this
in
their
brief.
and
so
for
example
i
think
under
the
aguilara
--
aguilar
case
which
this
case
instantly
falls
under
the
aguilar
case
because
of
the
affidavit,
two
credible
persons
does
not
even
--
it
even
falls
under
the
dissent
under
aguilar
because
in
aguilar
the
dissent,
the
parties
there
making
the
affidavit
had
some
personal
surveillance,
some
personal
contact
with
the
crime
at
hand.
but
in
this
case,
there
was
nothing.
it
can't
even
stand
under
the
dissent
in
aguilar
but
the
important
thing
we
think,
the
important
thing
about
this
is
that
if
we
think
it
has
been
superseded,
we
think
that
the
federal
acts
do
control
and
i
want
to
say
this,
that
if
this
court
is
silent
on
constitutionality
and
if
this
court
are
on
preemption,
the
effect
of
it
will
be
back
and
this
is
an
opinion
on
my
part,
the
effect
of
it
will
be
back
in
san
antonio
as
if
not
having
spoken
on
constitutionality
or
not
having
spoken
on
preemption,
then
we
will
go
back
to
san
antonio.
they
will
say,
“well,
the
supreme
court
didn't
say
it
was
unconstitutional.
they
didn't
say
it
was
preempted,
so
that's
a
signal
to
get
this
man
indicted”.
now
if
this
man,
if
this
law
is
unconstitutional
and
if
he
is
indicted,
we'll
be
back
in
two
or
three
years
and
so,
the
status,
the
state
of
texas
has
joined
in
with
me
on
asking
for
a
ruling
on
constitutionality
or
preemption.
now
we
say
that
there
is
a
preemption
because
of
the
smith
act,
internal
security
act,
the
communist
control
act.
and
in
the
nelson
versus
pennsylvania
case
this
court
found
preempion
by
the
mere
availability
of
these
federal
statutes.
as
i
recall
it
in
that
decision,
no
man
have
been
indicted,
no
man
had
been
--
there
was
a
--
simply
a
mere
availability
whereas
in
this
case,
stanford
has
already
had
hearing
for
the
u.s.
communist
control
act
of
1954.
he's
already
been
served
by
the
u.s.
marshal
and
told
to
register
or
suffer
a
penalty
of
$5000
a
day
or
imprisonment
for
five
days
--
four
to
five
years
for
each
day
of
--
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
it
said
that
he
was
violating
the
texas
communist
control
law
and
the
texas
communist
suppression
laws
your
honors,
which
by
necessity
includes
the
government
of
united
states
of
america,
the
several
--
or
the
several
states
or
of
texas.
it
was
not
isolated.
it
was
not
carved
out
and
set
aside
just
for
the
state
of
texas.
now,
congress
also
has
acted
in
addition
of
the
three
acts
that
this
mentioned,
the
immigration
nationality
act,
the
defense
dedication
act,
internal
revenue
code,
postal
service,
temporary
(inaudible)
--
temporary
unemployment
compensation
act,
the
national
science
foundation
act
on
this
question
of
communism.
now,
let's
--
keeping
in
mind
the
international
conspiracy
of
communism
as
defined
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
by
this
court
on
another
decision,
it
is
our
opinion
that
it
is
impossible.
it
is
impossible
than
those
in
sedition
by
the
communist
--
international
communist
conspiracy
against
the
state
of
texas,
be
it
in
zapata
county
along
the
rio
grande
where
there
are
not
many
people
or
in
san
antonio.
now,
let's
take
barrett
county
for
example,
let's
assume
the
purpose
of
argument
that
the
international
communist
conspiracy
desired
--
decides
to
take
over
barrett
county,
a
county
in
texas,
is
a
part
of
the
state
of
texas.
alright,
they
just
take
over
barrett
county,
not
the
whole
state
of
texas
or
the
government,
but
they
take
over
the
geographical
limits
of
barrett
county
and
they
announced
it's
all
they
want
at
the
county
courthouse
in
this
county.
it'd
take
over
randolph
air
force
base.
they'd
take
over
lackland
air
force
base.
they'd
take
over
fort
sam
houston.
they'd
take
over
kelly
air
force
base.
they'd
take
over
the
atomic
energy
commission
and
they'd
take
over
the
aerial
medical
--
outer
space
medical
center.
this
goes
on
and
on
and
it's
inconceivable
that
the
international
communist
conspiracy
to
takeover
even
barrett
county
without
affecting
the
paramount
rights
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
of
america.
now
this
court
hasspoken
of
the
need
for
a
uniform
system
of
regulation
in
hines
versus
davidowitz,
312
u.s.
53.
in
the
pennsylvania
law,
requiring
aliens
to
register
were
superseded
by
the
federal
immigration
law.
and
that
this
court
there
saying
that
there's
the
--
this
was
a
problem
that
affected
the
interest
of
america,
of
immigrants
coming
to
all
parts
of
america,
and
therefore
it
shouldn't
--
there's
shouldn't
be
50
different
immigration
law.
now,
let's
suppose
we
have
50
different
sedition
laws
in
america.
who
is
then
seditious
under
this?
they've
picked
up
--
when
you
read
the
inventory
what
they
picked
up
here,
and
this
is
an
example
of
what
happens
when
you
have
50
different
sedition
laws
in
the
united
states
of
america,
who
will
be
seditious
next
on
the
50
different
laws.
chella
negro
in
mississippi
reaching
out
for
a
polity
under
the
law,
is
he
going
to
be
seditious.
shall
a
texas
oilman
complaining
about
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
will
he
if
the
pendulum
swing
become
seditious
under
the
law?
it's
this
type
of
thing.
it
could
be
--
we
can
have
50
different
steps,
50
different
norms,
50
different
standards.
now,
we
think
section
9
of
the
texas
suppression
law
is
--
this
is
--
is
unconstitutional
because
on
its
face
and
as
applied
in
this
case
it
violates
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment.
section
9
of
the
suppression
law
says
that
a
warrant
may
issue
to
seize
books,
records,
pamphlets,
recordings,
books
showing
a
violation
of
the
act.
now
how
do
books
show
a
violation
on
the
act?
now,
the
--
this
is
not
question
obscene
books,
it's
not
a
question
obscene
books.
they
picked
up
--
they
--
what
they're
saying
is
that
if
you
read
mr.
i.f.
stone's
newsletter
you
have
seditious
literature
in
your
home
so
it
isn't
a
question
at
all
about
obscenity
here.
in
marcus
versus
property
search
warrant,
this
court
said
that
a
statute
permitting
seizure
of
books
before
a
hearing
was
had
--
would
be
declared
invalid.
well,
look
what
has
happened
here
in
this
case
where
a
particularly
--
particularly
there's
no
question
of
obscenity
at
all.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
at
--
in
the
hearing
they
offered
to
return
his
marriage
license
and
the
title
to
his
home
and
the
title
to
his
car
and
i
as
his
attorney
would
not
accept
it
at
that
time
for
fear
that
it
might
constitute
some
waiver
of
the
rights
of
my
client.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
sir?
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
but
i
think
--
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
that
--
approximately,
that
was
all.
his
marriage
license
i
think
and
his
title
to
his
home,
title
to
his
car
and
his
blue
cross
policy.
mr.
barlow
will
get
up
a
little
bit
and
i
--
he
will
know
what
he
offered
but
principally
that
was
it.
principally
that
was
all
that
was
offered
to
be
returned.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
in
the
--
at
the
trial,
at
the
hearing?
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
i
don't
follow
you.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
oh!
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
about
10
days.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
approximately
that
because
i
think
we
have
to
get
people
--
the
opposite
side
10
days
notice
to
and
set
it
down
on
a
hearing
on
a
motion.
so
it
was
approximately
that.
there
was
no
disagreement
between
mr.
barlow
and
myself
on
that.
now,
we
think
that
section
9
of
the
suppression
law
is
unconstitutional
in
both
of
these
laws
as
applied
in
this
case
they're
unconstitutional
because
it
forced
mr.
stanford
to
give
evidence
against
himself.
and
no
question,
i
don't
--
it
gets
down
to
a
question
of
evidence
of
course
and
instrumentality
but
if
they
picked
up
correspondence
between
mr.
stanford
and
his
local
counsel
or
a
counsel
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union
in
houston
discussing
his
difficulties,
telling
him
to
come
to
san
antonio
and
see
me,
they
picked
up
correspondents
where
this
man
discussed
his
case
with
his
defense
committee
in
new
york
city
on
the
federal
charge
against
him.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
marriage
license,
his
blue
cross
policies,
title
to
his
house,
title
to
his
car,
such
things
as
that.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
that's
all.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
sir?
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
no,
those
are
not
--
those
are
not
--
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
--
offered
--
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
that
they
--
the
dissenting
opinion
is
still
there
and
i
have
high
hopes
that
the
office
of
the
attorney
general
will
read
that
opinion
in
(inaudible)
statute,
i
hope
very
much
that
they
will.
now
--
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
i
don't
know
now,
not
yet
--
not
--
all
it
said
was,
“the
dissenting
opinion
of
justice
hugo
black”
and
i
don't
know
what
the
opinion
was
and
it's
not
the
record
what
it
was
and
so
i'm
not
at
liberty
to
talk
about
it.
i
actually
know,
but
i'll
check
on
it
later
on
but
it's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
sir.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
i'll
find
out
about
that.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
i
don't
know.
he
doesn't
need
to
read
it
as
badly
as
some
others
do
in
this
case
your
honor,
he
--
but
now
--
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
just
the
opinion,
it
was
just
the
opinion.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
the
last
time
i
read
there
was
a
story
in
the
san
antonio
newspaper
that
the
fbi
were
cuffing
them
all
down
in
reading
it
and
so
i
don't
know
where
they
are
now
your
honor
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
no,
no,
but
they
--
just
that
the
attorney
general
and
the
office
of
district
attorney
(inaudible)
and
let
them
write
them
all
down,
the
list
of
it
so
it
maybe
over
there
and
maybe
mr.
barlow,
he
can
tell
you
later
on,
i
don't
know.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
not
--
well,
he
was
there.
the
district
attorney
is
very
generous
in
giving
me
a
list
of
the
inventory
and
he
was
very
generous
in
letting
me
have
records
and
letters,
that
the
receipt
to
put
in
the
evidence,
anything
i
want
to
put
in
the
evidence,
he
let
me
put
in
the
evidence.
he
was
completely
generous
and
thoughtful
in
that
regard.
i
have
no
complaint
about
the
way
mr.
barlow
treated
me
once
we
got
in
the
court.
now
--
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
now,
the
letter
in
which
he
wrote
after
the
assassination
to
message
kennedy,
it's
in
the
transcript.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
page
110
and
that
was
seized
--
you
see
what
--
i
don't
think
in
fairness
to
the
state,
i
don't
think
they
deliberately
picked
out
a
letter
to
mrs.
kennedy.
but
what
--
they
went
in
--
they
went
in
and
we
went
in
court.
they
were
just
filing
cabinets
all
over.
they
just
can
--
and
this
was
one
of
the
many
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
letters
of
this
man,
they
took
them.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
they
did
not
take
out
--
well,
they
didn't
think
--
they
didn't
--
they
didn't
think
they
had.
i
didn't
know
at
the
time
when
i
was
going
into
this
subject
at
the
trial
that
they
had
taken
out
justice
black's
opinion
in
“pacem
in
terris”
because
there's
a
long
--
it
was
written
in
handwriting,
it's
hard
to
read
with
just
one
(inaudible)
on
my
side
and
four
on
the
others,
and
we
were
moving
fast
and
i
didn't
know
what
they'd
take.
they
thought
the
only
thing
that
had
taken
out
was
seditious
letter
therein.
and
they
did.
i
repeatedly,
for
example,
i
hand
him
a
book
and
say,
“the
book
--
castro,
the
bearded
despot,
the
danger
and
menace
to
the
united
states
of
america,”
say
why
wouldn't
you
take
that
out
and
they
would
say,
"well,
that
didn't
conform
with
the
affidavit".
so
this
was
--
and
this
was
--
he
may
not
have
had
his
well-balanced
library
that
i
would
like
him
to
have,
but
he
did
have
--
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
but
he
did
have.
he
did
have
considerable,
“any
communist”
literature
in
his
home
and
it
wasn't
taken
out.
and
in
the
affidavit
it
said
--
affidavit
said,
"take
out
all
books
concerning
communism".
now
that's
just
the
standard.
well,
then
you'll
going
to
empty
a
lot
of
libraries,
personal
libraries
in
texas.
it
will
play
havoc
with
our
virtues
back
home.
oh,
now,
the
--
there
was
no
probable
cause.
we
don't
think
it
was
shown
in
this
case
under
aguilar
you
--
in
aguilar,
it
said
the
--
affiance
have
received
reliable
information
from
a
credible
person
and
do
believe
that
heroine
etcetera
kept
at
above
described
premises.
in
the
stanford
affidavit,
it
is
the
same
thing
except
as
i
said
earlier,
it
goes
a
step
further
in
violating
concepts
of
what
constitutes
probable
cause
because
in
--
at
least
as
pointed
out
in
the
dissent
in
aguilar
the
two
policemen
had
had
inducted
personal
surveillance
of
this
--
of
the
narcotics
situation.
whereas
in
this
situation
mr.
zweiner
and
mr.
v.
murray
jordan
had
no
personal
--
at
least,
there's
none
in
the
record.
no
personal
surveillance,
no
first
hand
information
of
this
case
whatsoever.
now
the
--
mr.
jordan
did
say
that
people
came
to
his
office
and
someone
told
me
that
stanford
was
mailing
out
communist
literature
and
he
showed
me
communist
literature.
but
then
mr.
--
then
later
on
of
course
mr.
jordan
in
court
said
that
he
had
no
polities
or
background
or
information
to
pass
on
this
and
so
we
think
this
is
what
was
hearsay.
we
think
that
his
case
should
also
be
--
could
be
reversed
on
the
fact
it
failed
to
specify
the
crime
charged.
and
i
said
earlier,
section
9
of
the
suppression
law
requires
that
the
warrant
specify
what
phase
or
phases
of
this
act
was
violated.
and
the
only
thing
--
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
no
i
don't
--
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
well,
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
of
america,
before
a
man's
home
is
broken
into
and
his
books
in
the
library
taken
away
under
the
idea
of
being
charged
with
a
crime,
it
couldn't
seem
that
the
constitution
protects
a
man's
home
to
the
extent
that
he
had
at
least
ought
to
have
some
charge
against
him
before
his
home
has
broken
into
and
they
didn't
do
it
here.
they
didn't
do
it
and
it
was
a
scattergun
type
of
allegation.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
yes.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
now
--
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
where
it
--
where
do
you
--
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
that's
right,
he
did
testify
that
someone
told
him
that
mr.
stanford
is
an
official
of
the
communist
party
that's
what
he
said,
on
a
hearsay
basis.
and
insofar
as
i
know
it,
it's
the
only
--
it
is
the
only
evidence
in
there
on
the
basis
of
what
somebody
told
him.
now,
we
think
also
that
this
law
--
these
two
laws
fall
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
fail
to
particularly
describe
the
things
to
be
seen.
it
talks
--
it
said
in
here
that
the
mandate
of
the
warrant
said
pick
up
books
and
records
and
pamphlets
and
cards
and
the
list
in
memoranda
concerning
the
communist
party.
now,
it's
our
contention
that
when
books
are
taken
especially
non-obscene
ones,
they
cannot
generally
be
described
as
a
class.
in
earlier
cases
marcus
versus
united
states
here
11,000
so
called
obscene
publications
were
carried
off
and
the
warrants
here
were
held
to
be
improper
because
they
were
based
on
a
conclusory
assertions
of
a
single
police
officer
without
any
scrutiny
by
the
judge.
we'll
there
wasn't
on
here
either.
now
finally
as
to
the
final
grounds
we
present,
that
i
will
appeal
to
mr.
barlow
and
later
mr.
mcavoy
i
suppose
will
reply
on
the
question
of
vagueness
in
this
case
naacp
versus
button,
371
u.s.
415,
“the
objectionable
quality
of
vagueness
depends
upon
the
danger
of
tolerating
the
existence
of
a
penal
statute
susceptible
of
slipping
an
improper
application”,
also
the
baggett
versus
bullitt
case
which
calls
for
objective
measurements
in
defining
a
subversive
person.
now
the
texas
communist
control
act,
section
1
defines
a
communist
as
a
person
who
is,
“is
a
member
of
the
communist
party
notwithstanding
that
he
may
not
pay
dues
or
hold
a
car”.
and
here
under
the
communist
--
under
this
communist
control
law,
a
nominal
membership
in
this
first
part
section
has
a
made
a
crime
without
reference
to
whether
or
not
there
is
any
knowing
or
active
participation.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
on
the
vagueness,
i
did
not
make
it
in
--
on
vagueness
in
the
supreme
court.
i
made
all
the
others
in
the
supreme
court.
secondly,
a
communist
is
a
person
who
knowingly
contributes
funds
or
any
character
or
property
to
the
communist
party.
thus,
here
alone
mere
contribution
alone
is
conclusive
evidence
of
being
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
third,
the
communist
is
defined
as
a
person
who
commits
or
advocates
the
commission
of
any
act,
“reasonably
calculated”
to
further
the
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states
of
america
or
texas.
and
of
course
we
don't
know
what
they
mean
by
the
term
reasonably
calculated.
finally,
they
say
a
person
is
a
communist
--
it
makes
a
person
a
communist
who
acts
to
overthrow
the
united
states
of
texas
by
"unlawful
or
unconstitutional
means",
and
generally
when
this
type
of
language
is
used
you
hear
the
phrase
by
force
and
violence
and
of
course
what
is
meant
by
the
phrase
unlawful
or
unconstitutional
means.
now,
finally
the
texas
communist
control
law,
section
2
defines
the
communist
party
as
being
controlled
by
the
union
of
(inaudible)
--
soviet
socialist
republics
are
full
--
its
satellites.
in
other
words,
if
you're
with
an
organization
which
as
controlled
by
satellite
of
russia
then
you
come
under
a
definition
of
a
communist
and
you're
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
well
now
--
what
it
--
who
are
the
satellites
of
russia?
well,
who
are
the
satellites
of
russia
today
and
what
are
the
satellites
of
russia
60
days
from
now.
this
is
a
vague
we
think,
a
vagueness
of
unconstitutionality.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
no.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
i
don't
think
we
do.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
we
did
not.
there
is
a
texas
suppression
act,
it
makes
illegal
the
communist
party,
“and
all
other
organizations
which
advocate
etcetera
--”
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
any
--
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
any
activities
intended
to
alter
the
constitutional
form
of
government
of
the
united
states
or
texas
by
violence
is
virtually
the
identical
language
we
think
was
struck
down
by
this
court
in
baggett
versus
bullitt.
now,
i
--
i'm
going
to
conclude
now
and
yield
to
mr.
barlow
or
the
other
gentleman
representing
the
state
of
texas.
i
do
though
won't
very
much
as
much
as
can
urge
upon
this
court
to
point
out
that
the
state
of
texas
has
joined
in
in
calling
for
a
ruling
on
preemption.
or
has
called,
has
joined
in
in
calling
for
a
ruling
of
constitutionality.
often
times
pieces
come
up
to
this
honorable
court
after
a
great
deal
of
harm
and
injury
and
mischief
has
been
done.
but
this
is
a
splendid
opportunity
that
these
laws
are
unconstitutional
or
if
they
are
--
or
if
they
have
been
preempted
to
stop
a
harm
in
advance
because
the
district
attorney
is
going
back
and
indict
this
man,
i
think,
if
the
court
is
silent
on
this
subject.
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
you're
talking
--
uphaus
versus
--
mr.
maury
maverick,
jr.
well
now,
the
--
in
the
first
place,
the
uphaus
case
involved
legislative
investigation.
the
second
place,
they're
waiting
to
carry
this
man
in
the
courthouse
and
get
him
indicted.
this
isn't
any
simple
legislative
investigation.
the
district
attorney
says
in
his
brief,
“we're
waiting
to
take
him
to
the
grand
jury”,
so
we
think
there's
an
instant
distinction
can
be
made
between
the
two
cases.
