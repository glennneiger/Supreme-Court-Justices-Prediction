mr.
john
j.
mcavoy
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
there's
a
story
told
about
lincoln
that
after
he
had
been
subjected
to
an
over
long
argument
by
opposing
counsel
that
he
was
reminded
and
told
the
court
that
he
was
reminded
of
the
lazy
preacher
who
used
to
get
up
and
give
sermon
--
very
long
sermons.
and
he
just
got
started
talking
and
was
too
lazy
to
stop.
i'm
not
going
to
do
that
i
hope.
there
are
some
errors
that
were
stated
along
the
way
that
are
purely
factual,
but
i
think
it
would
be
well
to
straighten
them
out
now.
a
reply
as
was
mentioned
was
filed
this
morning
which
deals
with
the
first
amendment
questions
of
vagueness
and
that
question
was
raised
in
the
trial
court
and
specifically
mentioned
in
paragraphs
which
are
in
both
the
motion
and
the
application
for
rehearing
on
pages
5
and
14
of
the
record.
so
the
issue
of
vagueness
is
not
being
presented
to
this
court
for
the
first
--
as
an
issue
which
has
never
been
before
--
judicially
considered
before.
the
court
has
shown
a
certain
interest
in
the
knowledge
of
the
attorney
general
and
that
is
the
affiance
about
information
they
had
about
the
books
and
their
content,
about
the
position
of
mr.
--
of
the
petitioner
mr.
stanford
and
this
suggests
that
in
some
way,
a
hearing
upon
return
of
the
warrant
can
cure
the
warrant
in
some
nunc
pro
tunc
fashion.
now
i
think
this
court
has
in
--
complete
agreement
that
that
isn't
really
possible.
the
warrant
will
have
to
--
and
its
issuance
will
have
to
be
judged
in
the
light
of
the
evidence,
the
facts
and
circumstances
before
the
magistrate
and
in
this
case
it
was
hearsay
evidence
only.
the
sources
of
that
hearsay
evidence
are
still
not
known
to
anyone
but
the
affiance.
the
magistrate
as
far
as
we
know
does
not
know
who
provided
the
information,
nor
their
reliability.
now
addressing
--
and
just
--
mr.
john
j.
mcavoy
indeed,
if
the
source
of
the
hearsay
is
shown
to
the
magistrate
to
be
a
credible
source
of
information
and
not
merely
asserted
to
be
a
credible
source.
one
thing
which
it
seems
to
have
been
i
think
distorted
or
misstated
in
discussing
preempts
--
in
discussing
preemption
is
a
characterization
of
the
texas
statutes
as
seditious
--
sedition
statutes.
i
think
it
would
be
well
to
note
that
the
statutes
by
name
and
by
constant
reiteration
by
legist
--
the
statement
of
legislative
purpose
in
the
preamble
are
concerned
not
with
sedition
generally
which
make
under
pennsylvania
versus
nelson
be
an
appropriate
area
for
state
action
today,
tomorrow
but
it
was
an
attempt
to
control
the
activities
of
the
communist
party.
this
is
not
some
san
antonio
anarchy
society.
this
is
--
it
is
asserted,
the
activities
of
the
texas
communist
party
an
affiliate
or
the
branch
of
the
united
states
communist
party
which
this
court
has
found
to
be
--
have
as
its
purpose
the
overthrow
of
the
united
states
government.
counsel
made
a
reference
to
--
i
thought
they
were
arguing
our
side
of
the
case
when
they
said
that
a
series
of
acts
directed
against
texas
would
be
the
normal
way
of
overthrowing
the
united
states
government.
indeed,
i
think
that
so,
and
that
is
the
very
reason
these
texas
statutes
and
other
state
statutes
which
are
directed
as
i
say,
not
at
sedition
generally
but
at
control
of
communist
activities
should
be
declared
unconstitutional
by
reason
of
preemption.
i
could
illustrate
that
perhaps
by
talking
about
communist
blowing
up
things
or
inciting
riots
as
was
illustrated.
there
is
no
argument
made
here
that
the
states
can't,
in
the
normal
exercise
of
their
police
power,
break
up
riots.
there
isn't
--
there
is
--
if
someone
is
killed
in
a
bombing
by
a
communist,
he
is
guilty
of
murder
and
should
be
prosecuted
for
it.
but
if
he's
activities
as
a
communist
are
the
--
in
other
words
if
the
--
if
he
--
if
the
state
seeks
to
punish
him
not
for
the
murder,
not
for
the
violence,
not
for
the
destruction
of
property,
but
ecause
of
communist
activities,
we
say
that
the
state
has
acted
beyond
the
limits
of
its
authority
and
power.
and
finally,
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
john
j.
mcavoy
i
would
say
that
that
statute
without
knowing
its
application
would
withstand
constitutional
challenge
as
applied
in
this
case
and
certainly
with
the
legislative
history
in
the
various
terms
of
the
statute
in
considering
the
statutes
of
texas
as
a
whole,
that's
a
different
case.
mr.
john
j.
mcavoy
yes,
that
is
it
exactly.
and
i
would
say
that
i'm
not
familiar
with
all
of
the
material
that
was
taken.
i
am
familiar
with
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
first
amendment.
it
has
been
suggested
that
somehow
these
books
have
used
by
communists
would
become
the
subject
of
some
kind
of
sanction
--
seizure
for
evidence
purposes,
for
some
other
reason.
i
think
that
that
is
just
plain
not
so.
dejonge
against
oregon
i
think
is
a
case
in
point.
there,
the
free
speech
activities
of
the
defendant
in
that
case
were
guaranteed
by
this
court
though
it
was
almost
conceited
throughout
that
he
was
a
known
communist,
but
has
to
be
protected
in
his
first
amendment
--
in
the
exercise
of
his
first
amendment
rights.
the
analogy
to
books
of
account
or
bed
sheets
or
beer
bottles
which
are
mentioned
in
the
brief
i
think
are
most
inapposite.
books
as
was
mentioned
can
be
used
as
sources
of
--
as
an
instrumentality
of
violence
just
as
a
pencil
can
be.
a
microphone
or
a
record,
any
such
items
but
they
have
within
them
two
qualities
both
a
physical
one
and
the
content
of
ideas.
they
are
--
when
seized
by
reason
of
their
physical
characteristics
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
but
the
ideas
of
minorities
or
others
even
if
they
are
directed
to
and
intended
to
resort
--
result
in
an
interest
in
--
overthrow
of
the
government
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
john
j.
mcavoy
i
haven't
the
slightest
doubts
that
that
book
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
john
j.
mcavoy
finally,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
have
asked
the
question
why
should
this
court
concern
itself
with
a
statute
which
hasn't
been
interpreted,
restricted,
refined
and
defined
by
the
texas
court.
in
1940,
in
thornhill
against
alabama,
a
statement
was
made
which
i
think
is
at
least
appropriate
and
worthy
of
your
consideration.
that
objection
was
made
at
that
time
in
that
case
and
this
court
responded
by
saying
there's
a
further
reason
for
testing
the
section
on
its
face.
proof
of
an
abusive
power
in
the
particular
case
has
never
been
deemed
a
requisite
for
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
purporting
to
license,
and
if
i
might
inject
or
otherwise
sanction
the
dissemination
of
ideas.
a
life
threat
is
inherent
in
the
penal
statutes
of
this
nature
which
does
not
aim
specifically
at
an
evil
within
the
allowable
area
of
state
control,
not
allowable
area
of
state
control
but
on
the
contrary
sweeps
within
its
ambit
other
activities
that
in
ordinary
circumstances
constitute
an
exercise
of
freedom
of
speech
or
of
the
press.
for
these
reasons
we
submit
that
on
the
grounds
of
preemption
in
the
first
amendment,
this
court
should
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
thank
you.
