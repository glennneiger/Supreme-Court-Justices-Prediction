mr.
james
e.
barlow
if
it
please
the
court.
i
think
to
begin
with
before
i
get
into
the
merits
of
it,
there
are
two
or
three
things
i
would
like
to
cover
as
side
issues.
first,
i
would
like
to
answer
justice
stewart's
question.
the
uphaus
case
is
precisely
the
problem
that
is
involved
here.
this
case
--
the
--
if
the
nels
--
common
worth
--
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
versus
nelson
had
remained
a
law
unin
--
unfettered
by
the
uphaus
case,
there
wouldn't
be
any
question
but
that
these
series
of
statutes,
a
series
of
statutes
under
the
term
that
sets
up
a
system
for
control
of
communist
on
the
statewide
would
have
been
preempted
by
the
federal
government.
but
up
--
mr.
james
e.
barlow
under?
mr.
james
e.
barlow
for
--
mr.
james
e.
barlow
yes
sir.
and
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
e.
barlow
that
was
made
clear
in
uphaus
when
they
said,
the
opinion
made
clear
--
this
is
uphaus,
that
a
state
could
proceed
with
prosecutions
for
sedition
against
the
state
itself.
that
it
can
legitimately
investigate
in
this
area
follows
in
sweezy
versus
state
of
new
hampshire,
then
they
go
on
to
say
that
if
the
state
could
protect
itself
from
actual
or
threat
of
sabotage
or
attempted
violence
of
all
kinds,
it
had
full
power
to
deal
with
internal
civil
disturbances
and
that
registration
statutes
which
this
is
virtually
is,
were
a
field
of
consideration
for
state
legislative
enactment.
now
if
the
state
has
the
authority
to
have
a
legislative
investigation
to
determine
whether
it
wants
to
have
a
registration
statute,
then
does
it
not
have
the
authority
to
pass
such
registration
statute?
what
would
be
the
purpose
of
investigating
under
uphaus
for
registration
statute
for
communist
if
you
had
no
authority
under
nelson
to
pass
such
a
statute
to
begin
with?
now
that
--
that's
what
this
is
all
about
and
what
we
are
doing
here.
now,
i
feel
kind
of
like
a
villain
in
the
plot.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
yes
sir,
but
this
statute,
both
of
these
texas
statutes
attempt
to
cover
both
the
united
states
and
texas
and
its
subdivisions.
now
the
problem
is
of
course
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
versus
nelson
taking
care
of
the
united
states.
but
the
problem
is
whether
or
not
you
can
still
have
a
valid
sedition
statute
against
texas,
that's
what
it
boils
down
to.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
no,
sir.
but
in
running
this
search
warrant,
a
portion
of
this
statute
stated
that
if
these
goods
were
used,
if
these
items
were
used
in
the
violation
of
this
particular
act,
we
had
a
party
to
run
a
search
warrant
and
if
--
even
though
i
feel
somewhat
like
a
villain
in
the
case
of
the
legislatures,
it
said
you
could
run
it
against
books,
papers,
periodicals
and
everything
else
and
names
all
of
these
things
specifically
in
the
statute.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
yes,
but
he
has
challenged
the
statute
--
the
search
on
the
general
invalidity
of
the
whole
scheme.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
yes
sir.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
yes,
sir.
there
are
a
lot
of
other
issues
in
this
case.
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
shame
to
myself
if
this
case
were
decided
on
the
narrow
issues
such
as
probable
cause
for
the
issuance
of
the
search
warrant
without
being
addressed
with
overall
issue,
that's
the
way
i
feel
about
it
because
ultimate
--
uphaus
leaves
a
big
question
mark
that
hangs
over
nelson
as
to
the
validity
of
the
state
to
operate
in
this
area.
now
let's
see
what
probable
cause
consisted
of
so
that
we
can
get
on
to
the
search.
the
affidavits
of
the
two
parties
that
gave
the
--
for
the
search
appeared
at
page
70
in
the
record
and
mr.
maverick
covered
that
pretty
well.
the
application
in
warrant
appear
at
71
and
72.
lonny
zwiener
one
of
the
people
who
(inaudible)
the
warrant
testified
before
magistrate
as
follows.
question,
“you
stated
you
had
information
as
to
the
use
of
the
books
but
never
did
describe
what
the
information
was
and
what,
would
you
describe
what
that
was?”
mr.
barlow,
from
certain
confidential
sources
being
credible
citizens
of
the
state
of
texas
we
learned
the
following
that
john
stanford
was
and
as
a
communist.
secondly,
has
for
many
years
distributed
literature
which
has
been
described
to
us
by
credible
persons
as
communistic
literature
which
follows
a
communist
line
and
designed
to
foreign
aids
and
purposes
of
the
communist
party.
these
credible
persons
also
informed
us
that
this
type
of
literature,
pamphlets
and
so
forth
were
located
on
the
premises
of
john
stanford
and
has
recently
as
disclosed
by
the
affidavit,
december
12th
that
this
of
this
type
of
literature
have
been
previously
indicated
and
described
in
(inaudible)
thereto
was
mailed
from
the
home
address
of
john
stanford,
two
separate
things,
one,
the
information
that
they
have
that
he
has
the
literature,
and
the
mailing
which
is
a
separate
thing
altogether.
it's
made
a
little
clear
in
the
testimony
of
jordan
that
based
--
mr.
james
e.
barlow
yes
sir.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
yes
sir,
it
was.
now
--
mr.
james
e.
barlow
as
to
the
--
mr.
james
e.
barlow
this
is
a
magistrate's
hearing.
this
is
a
record
of
magistrate's
hearing
after
the
warrant
was
issued.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
now,
i'll
--
mr.
james
e.
barlow
i'll
tell
you
this
sir.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
this
was
--
mr.
james
e.
barlow
the
only
thing
in
the
record
is
the
affidavit
at
70,
the
application
at
71,
and
the
warrant
at
72.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
yes
sir.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
alright
sir.
that
they
have
good
reason
and
do
believe
this
is
the
affidavit.
there
are
certain
place
and
premises
described
as
a
two-frame
houses
and
one
garage
located
in
an
address
and
being
the
premises
under
control
in
charge
of
john
william
stanford
is
a
place
where
books,
records,
pamphlets
cards
etcetera
listing
everything
to
the
statute
list
concerning
the
communist
party
of
texas
and
the
operations
of
the
communist
party
in
texas
are
unlawfully
possessed
in
use
and
violation
of
these
articles.
such
belief
is
based
on
the
following
information.
recent
mailings
by
stanford
on
the
12th
of
december
1963
of
material
from
his
home
address.
such
material
being
identified
as
pro-communist
material
and
other
information
received
in
the
course
of
investigation
that
stanford
has
in
his
possession
the
books
and
records
of
the
texas
communist
party.
now,
this
warrant
was
run
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
aguilar.
so
the
elements
of
the
credible
portion
and
the
fact
that
the
--
the
facts
upon
which
the
credibility
of
the
person
were
based
were
something
which
were
not
included
other
than
what
has
been
stated
here.
then
in
the
testimony,
they
testified
as
to
the
fact
that
they
had
received
from
these
informants
and
they
were
credible
as
information.
then,
in
the
application
for
the
search
warrant
which
is
the
next
document
it
is
stated
in
slightly
different
language.
it
is
the
same
thing.
it
says
that
this
author
has
information
from
two
credible
persons
that
the
party
named
above
as
such
books
and
records
in
his
possession
which
are
the
books
and
records
of
the
communist
party
including
the
party
list
and
dues
payments
and
in
addition
to
other
items
listed
above,
that
such
information
is
of
recent
origin
and
has
been
confirmed
by
recent
mailings
of
stanford
on
the
12th
of
december
1963.
then
of
course
the
warrant
doesn't
include
any
of
the
information
upon
which
it
is
based.
it
was
merely
a
formal
warrant.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
no
sir.
they
found
all
sorts
of
things
but
not
the
records
of
the
party.
not
the
dues
list
or
dues
payments,
there
were
no
lists
of
dues
payments
or
actual
records
that
we
could
ascertain
the
records
with
the
party
themselves.
now,
another
narrow
--
mr.
james
e.
barlow
no.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
his
personal
items
were
seized
with
the
file
cabinet
which
contained
records
which
began
with
a
record
of
the
gus-hall
benjamin
davis
defense
committee.
now,
this
--
the
--
and
this
was
seized
along
with
--
these
were
not
commercial,
in
fact
records.
this
--
that
this
--
most
of
this
type
of
material
was
correspondence
in
a
file
cabinet
which
was
seized
and
at
the
end
of
the
file
cabinet
were
these
personal
items
which
were
tendered
back
to
him
including
a
great
deal
more
than
just
what
we
have
discussed.
everything
that
is
personal
was
tendered
back
to
him.
but
it
was
listed
on
the
front
the
gus-hall
benjamin
davis
defense
committee
and
the
file
--
and
that
was
what
was
seized
with
that
particular
file
cabinet
and
it
is
listed
in
here
as
a
file
cabinet
beginning
with
the
gus-hall
benjamin
davis
defense
committee.
but
that
and
index
cards
in
the
cabinets
showing
the
names
and
addresses
of
various
people
were
included
which
were
not
--
which
were
seized
and
then
everything
else
would
i
assume
be
commercial
publications
to
the
various
sources.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
it
was
just
--
mr.
james
e.
barlow
just
index
cards
with
names
of
people.
the
--
so
far
as
i
could
tell
from
looking
at
them,
they're
just
index
cards
with
names
of
people.
i
mean
they
don't
--
mr.
james
e.
barlow
yes
sir,
just
names
of
people
around
the
united
states
that
don't
have
any
particular
significance.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
sir?
mr.
james
e.
barlow
no
sir.
i
have
tendered
back
his
personal
items.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
yes
sir.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
nearly
all
of
it
--
mr.
james
e.
barlow
that's
right.
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
at
least
24
copies.
practically
many
of
these
items
were
--
most
of
them
were
in
multiple
copies.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
yes
sir,
that
which
are

mr.
james

barlow
yes

mr.
james

mr.

mr.
james

i
do
not

mr.
james

barlow
i
do

mr.
james
e.
barlow
the
assistant
(voice

--
mr.
james
e.
barlow
he
stated
in
the
--
he
stated
in
his
testimony
that
his
information
was
that
when
they
had
an
official
meeting
of
the
communist
party,
that
this
man
would
bring
certain
books
and
items
from
that
he
would
tell
them
what
they
--
that
he
used
this
as
material
and
demonstrate
to
them
the
communist
party
line.
this
was
the
information
he
had.
so
he
showed
--
and
he
--
and
the
assistant
attorney
general
testified
that
he
had
been
shown
by
his
informant
this
material
and
allowed
to
look
at
it
but
not
allowed
to
keep
any
of
it.
he
had
been
brought
and
he
had
been
shown
this
particular
type
of
material
and
that
he
knew
what
he
was
selecting
from
that
particular
situation,
he
knew
what
he
was
looking
for
from
that.
and
that
was
(voice

--
mr.
james
e.
barlow
he
was
looking
for
a
material
which
was
similar
to
the
fact
material
that
he
said
that
he
had
been
shown
by
informants
as
being
used
in
these
session
(voice

--
mr.
james
e.
barlow
there's
a
texas
statute
sir
that
makes
it
seizable
under
section
9
if
that
statute
is
valid.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
but
it
specifically
points
out
books
and
materials
(voice

mr.
james

used
in

mr.

it
prohibits
membership,

mr.

it

mr.

realized
that
sounds

a
ridiculous
conclusion

the

yes.
that's
true.
mr.
james

yes

mr.

they
did.
mr.

wasn't

have

all
of
the

that
was

mr.

i
don't
have
any
theory
from
which
i
can
support
that
your
honor,
as
you
can
(voice

--
mr.
james
e.
barlow
certainly
not.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
i
don't
think
so
sir.
i
am
not
that
well
acquainted
with
international
law
to
be
able
to
tell
the
--
i
don't
really
know
what
a
lot
of
these
books
are.
if
you
want
to
know
--
mr.
james
e.
barlow
but
i
assume
if
their
books
printed
in
any
area
of
the
world
are
distributed
in
the
united
states,
they're
not
illegal
to
own
under
ordinary
circumstances.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
they
testified
that
they
had
been
shown
the
material
that
was
used
in
the
communist
party
who
made
this
--
their

their

had
been
given
by

these
items

mr.

samples
of
this
type
of
literature
--
mr.
james
e.
barlow
yes.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
i
do
not
know
sir,
the
record
does
not
reflect.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
i
do
not
know
sir.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
the
man
who
had
seen
it
made
the
seizure,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
sir,
i
assumed
that
they
didn't
read
all
the
books.
they
couldn't
have
possibly
read
that
many,
many.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
i
assume
they
took
it
by
the
titles
and
by
whoever
wrote
the
items,
i
assume.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
i
don't
know
sir.
but
what
is
reflected
in
the
inventory
was
what
was
we
seized.
it
appears
to
me
that
in
this
particular
case
that
i
am
hoping
as
mr.
maverick
told
you
that
the
court
will
go
beyond
the
mere
search
on
this
case
and
take
a
look
at
the
underlying
foundation
of
statute
on
this
particular
case.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
magistrate's
hearing.
it
has
been
appealed
by
the
fact
that
we
have
stipulated
that
it
was
final
and
we
have
brought
it
up
before
you
for
consideration.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
no
sir.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
yes
sir,
the
validity
of
the
statute
was
raised.
that
was
--
mr.
james
e.
barlow
sir?
mr.
james
e.
barlow
they
raised
by
conditional
supplement
--
they
filed
a
supplementary
brief
yesterday
or
the
day
before
and
challenged
the
validity
of
our
act.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
yes
sir.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
no
sir
but
i
think
if
you
will
look
at
the
application
they
made
for
the
return
of
the
documents,
they
challenged
the
validity
of
the
entire
act
should
be
(voice

--
mr.
james
e.
barlow
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
the
--
he
overruled
all
of
the
challenges
to
the
search
and
all
of
the
challenges
to
the
validity
of
the
statute.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
this
case
has
never
been
in
the
texas
supreme
court.
this
case
--
they
never
passed
on
this
case
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
yes
sir.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
by
a
single
judge
in
barrett
county.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
and
from
that
--
under
the
texas
law
that
judgment
is
final.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
it
cannot
be
appealed.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
well
i
think
certainly
the
validity
of
the
second
state
statute
and
no
doubt
the
validity
of
section
9
and
probably
the
validity
of
the
first
because
they
constitute
one
scheme
of
legislation
covering
one
particular
phase
that
they
both
have
to
be
read
together.
one
was
passed
in
1951
and
was
passed
in
1954.
the
51st
statute
is
almost
verbatim
to
the
smith
act.
the
54th
statute
is
almost
verbatim
in
the
internal
securities
act
of
the
united
states
with
some
additions
made
to
it.
it
has
some
additions
made
to
it.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
yes
sir.
both
the
statutes
are
--
mr.
james
e.
barlow
--
referred
to
in
the
affidavit
as
the
grounds
from
the
search
warrant
and
both
were
considered
by
the
court
who
made
the
determination.
that's
true.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
yes
sir.
mr.
james
e.
barlow
yes
sir,
i
think
--
mr.
james
e.
barlow
--
that
both
of
--
i
think
both
of
them
are
properly
before
you
for
consideration.
thank
you.
