mr.
hawthorne
phillips
may
it
please
the
court.
i
might
attempt
to
answer
the
chief
justice
question
concerning
these
various
books
that
are
not
in
themselves
possibly
illegal
if
they
were
found
in
the
library
of
the
university.
this
would
depend
and
it
would
certainly
depend
on
the
evidence
produced
on
the
trial
as
whether
or
not
these
books
were
actually
used
as
an
instrumentality
of
crime.
in
other
words
the
communist
manifesto
is
just
a
document.
something
that
might
be
read,
something
of
interest
something
to
be
studied
as
a
document
in
history
would
be
one
thing.
but
the
communist
manifesto
being
taught
as
a
document
or
as
a
theory
to
influence
those
who
were
hearing
the
teaching
to
adopt
that
is
a
theory
with
the
idea
of
subsequently
at
perpetuous
time
overthrowing
the
government
of
the
city
or
the
state,
or
the
united
states,
would
cause
these
documents
to
be
instruments
of
crime.
the
same
with
the
books
themselves,
books
advocating
particular
lines
of
communist
spirit,
it
would
be
necessary
to
prove
that
in
evidence
on
the
trial,
the
other
portions,
the
other
testimony
would
have
to
do
that,
testimony
of
people
who
were
present
--
possibly
at
meetings
where
these
books
were
used.
now,
that
goes
of
course
to
the
burden
of
proof
that
would
be
on
the
state
before
there
could
be
a
conviction.
as
was
pointed
out
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
no
sir,
i'm
saying
that
it
can
be
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
--
an
instrumentality
of
the
crime
itself
if
it's
used
in
that
manner
because
part
of
communism
is
not
all
action.
a
good
portion
of
it
is
the
teaching
of
thought
and
doctrine
and
indoctrinating
people
to
be
willing
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
and
violence.
now,
these
books
were
used
as
a
part
of
that
scheme.
they
would
be
more
than
mere
evidence.
they
would
be
an
instrumentality
itself.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that
is
correct.
there
are
some
things
that
are
contraband
of
themselves.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
there
are
other
things
that
depend
on
the
manner
in
which
they
are
used.
i
believe
the
court
has
recognized
that
in
even
holding
that
a
book
and
record
that
was
seized
in
a
prohibition
case
that
it
was
seized
at
the
time
when
it
showed
the
operation
and
that
was
an
instrumentality
of
the
business
of
a
crime.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that's
correct
in
themselves.
certainly,
they
would
not
be
an
instrumentality
of
crime.
they
would
be
mere
evidence.
it
would
depend
on
the
use
to
which
they
were
put
and
how
they
were
used.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that
is
correct.
i
agree
with
you
entirely
there.
that
there's
no
question,
the
use
to
which
the
books
are
put
and
how
they
are
used
will
determine
whether
or
not
the
seizure
was
good.
now
that
would
have
to
be
brought
out
at
the
time
of
the
trial
if
they
were
all
put
in
evidence.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
think
--
i
wouldn't
go
that
far.
certainly,
the
book
would
have
to
be
on
the
subject.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that
is
correct.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
because
ideas
such
as
abstract
ideas
this
court
has
held
can
be
expressed
and
it
is
not
in
violation
of
the
first
--
it
would
be
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment
to
suppress
it.
but
if
that
book
was
used,
the
book
would
express
the
idea.
the
idea
would
have
to
be
furthered.
it
would
be
only
a
part
of
the
scheme
or
part
of
the
pattern.
that
would
have
to
be
--
stating
now
this
is
the
theory
and
along
with
this
theory
which
is
correctly
stated
in
this
book,
in
this
work,
we're
urging
you
to
further
go
forward
with
the
theory
of
overthrowing
the
government
of
united
states,
or
of
the
state,
or
of
the
political
subdivision
by
force
and
violence.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
could
be
a
question
as
to
what
he
was
using
and
how
he
was
using
it.
in
other
words
these
books
being
passed
out
to
members
in
a
class
teaching
them
communist
theory
with
the
idea
as
a
part
of
the
overall
plan
of
the
communist
party
would
be
instruments
themselves.
if
they're
so,
they
are
distributed
to
the
general
public
not
necessarily.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
there
has
--
there
is
none
in
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
do
not
know
that
the
record
reflects
anything
definitely
in
that
regard.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
and
in
that
case
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
other
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
our
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
well
other
than
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
other
than
the
information
from
the
informants
to
the
effect
that
were
--
that
these
books
were
used
in
the
teaching
of
communist
place.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
believe
the
record
will
reflect
that
the
informants
say
that
they
were
used
in
that
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
not
by
name,
no
sir.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
other
than
that
the
man
--
or
the
man
who
made
the
search
were
exhibited
--
stated
that
they
were
exhibited
copies
of
certain
books
that
were
used
and
they
have
picked
purportedly
that
type
book
up
or
that
book
up.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
other
than
that
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
certainly
in
a
situation
regarding
pornographic
books,
the
test
of
course
would
be
the
book
itself
what
it
contained.
the
matters
expressed
in
it.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
you
mean
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
there,
the
other
titles.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
back
in
--
only
again
say
--
that
only
insofar
as
they
are
used
as
instrumentalities
otherwise
i
could
give
no
answer.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
no
sir.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
there
again,
i
think
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
other
that
in
--
in
the
particular
book,
favoring
the
cuban
situation
which
i
have
not
read
and
can't
speak
on
with
authority,
i
would
state
it
again
it
would
be
in
the
manner
and
the
doctrine
stated
anything
how
it
was
used
in
relation
to
the
communist
party
as
a
whole
and
the
advancement
of
the
party.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
can't
answer
that
sir.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
other
than
what
appears
on
the
record
before
the
court,
they
have
been
mr.
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
they
have
been
in
mr.
barlow's
possession.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
do
not
believe
that
issue
was
tried
in
the
court
below
or
that
they
did
go
in
to
that
matter,
because
normally
in
the
state
of
texas,
those
matters
are
raised
at
the
time
of
the
trial
if
should
a
criminal
charge
be
filed.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
well
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
in
the
manner
which
it
was
being
used,
a
ledger
--
if
a
ledger,
an
innocent
ledger
from
the
publishing
house
that
anyone
can
buy
in
a
bookstore
could
be
considered
an
instrumentality
of
crime
i
think
there
again
it
would
go
to
the
method
of
use.
now
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
not
for
the
--
not
the
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
wouldn't'
think
so,
not
until
there
was
a
determination
of
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
no
sir,
that's
certainly
not
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make.
let's
go
in
a
good
bit
farther
in
the
fact.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
not
--
if
it
was
used
--
depending
again
on
use.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that
is
correct.
i
think
basically,
what
i'm
contending
that
if
the
book
itself
is
used
or
a
portion
of
the
book
is
used
in
connection
with
other
crimes,
not
of
itself,
but
it
would
have
to
be
in
connection
with
the
scheme
or
a
plan.
assume
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
now
that
are
actually
being
used.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
the
particular
books
only.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
not
any
book.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
a
book
that
is
being
actually
used
by
a
particular
individual.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
on
which
there
is
definite
information.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
think,
we
go
a
little
bit
farther
in
this
particular
instance
in
describing
those
relating
to
the
communist
party.
now
i
will
admit
to
the
court
that
in
picking
up
file
cabinets
and
things
of
that
nature,
certainly
other
matters
were
in
those
file
cabinets
as
they
did
not
discover.
there
was
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
what?
i
didn't
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
can't
answer
that.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
word.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
theoretically,
the
officer
was
supposed
to
seize
books
relating
to
the
communist
party
and
his
doctrines
set
out
in
the
search
warrant.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
do
not
believe
that
the
document
made
a
particular
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
--
distinction.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
document
made
a
particular
distinction.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
they
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
in
violation
of
the
act.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that
is
the
language
i
believe
of
the
warrant.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
would
say
under
the
terms
of
the
warrant
that's
probably
correct.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
there
--
it's
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
officer
did
go
too
far,
i
think
under
the
instructions
coupled
with
the
information
that
had
been
had
from
informants
to
the
two
lawyers
that
accompanied
the
officer,
they
were
supposed
to
have
picked
out
only
the
books
that
had
been
used
or
had
been
exhibited
by
an
informant
together
with
records
of
the
communist
party
and
i
assume
those
were
picked
out.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
well,
mr.
justice
black,
the
particular
facts
on
the
case
where
--
that
the
parties
accompanying
the
officer
had
been
exhibited
certain
books
by
the
informant.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
possibly
as
a
general
measure.
in
the
particular
case,
the
officer
was
accompanied
by
the
persons
to
whom
the
books
had
been
exhibit
or
similar
books
had
been
exhibited
by
the
informant,
point
out
and
to
pick
out
the
books.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
the
warrant?
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
the
warrant
is
general
in
nature
to
be
in
that
regard.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
do
not
believe
that
they
went
into
that
in
the
court
below
on
the
hearing
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
because
normally
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
normally,
under
texas
procedure
the
objection
is
made
at
the
time
that
they're
offered
out
of
trial.
i
did
want
to
talk
with
the
court
and
had
not
prepared
a
particular
talk
on
the
question
we've
just
been
discussing
but
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
acts
themselves.
this
case
of
course
presents
some
important
and
very
basic
problems
in
the
field
of
state
federal
relations
and
namely
--
or
the
constitutionality
of
sedition
laws
of
texas
and
whether
or
not
that
these
laws
have
been
preempted
or
that
the
federal
government
has
preempted
this
field.
as
we
stated
that
no
criminal
proceedings
have
yet
been
commenced
in
connection
with
this
case,
whether
or
not
the
search
warrant
was
held
to
be
invalid
and
the
particular
evidence
seized
there
under
was
eliminated,
we
still
have
a
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
these
statures.
certainly
the
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
don't
believe
i
understand
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
certainly,
we
would
be
entitled
to
present
other
evidence
other
than
that
received
under
cert.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
some
of
the
materials
are
certainly
true,
others
--
other
portions
of
it,
it
isn't
true.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
quite
a
number,
quite
a
number.
but
in
connection
with
the
question
of
preemption,
i
believe
that
we
can
safely
state
that
this
court
has
found
on
several
occasions
the
nature
of
the
communist
party.
that
certainly
in
that
connection,
in
the
field
again
of
preemption,
we
might
state
that
the
government
of
a
state
or
a
city
of
the
united
states
isn't
overthrown
by
a
single
act.
it
would
have
to
be
a
series
of
acts
and
i
believe
this
court
has
recognized
that
doctrine.
the
one
they
stated
in
the
dennis
case
that
--
but
to
have
a
clear
and
present
danger
it
was
not
necessary
that
there
actually
be
a
push
but
that
certainly
an
attempt
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
even
though
doomed
from
the
outset
because
inadequate
numbers
or
powers
of
the
revolutionist
is
a
sufficient
evil
for
congress
to
prevent.
the
damage
with
such
attempt
creates
both
physically
and
politically
into
a
nation
makes
it
impossible
to
measure
the
validity
in
terms
of
probable
success.
now,
certainly
the
acts
that
i'll
state
--
might
go
into,
might
consider
to
be
seditious,
could
be
a
situation
i
think
--
i
can
think
of
a
number
of
inciting
a
riot
possibly
as
part
of
a
design
or
scheme
to
eventually
probably
overthrow
the
national
government
but
immediately
to
create
a
condition
of
chaos
on
a
local
level.
certainly
if
you
have
a
riot
and
the
breaking
down
of
law
order
as
a
part
of
a
scheme
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
state
or
to
go
away
with
the
government
of
the
city
and
that
riot
does
for
a
time
being
cause
a
breakdown
in
law
enforcement,
you
have
had
a
temporary
breakdown
or
an
overthrow
of
the
government
of
that
particular
city.
now
certainly
the
one
instance
is
cert
--
it's
soon
overcome.
but
you
might
likened
it
to
water
dripping
on
a
stone.
certainly
one
drop
doesn't
do
any
appreciable
damage,
but
a
series
of
events
conducted
over
a
period
of
time
in
different
localities
creates
a
disrespect
for
law
and
for
order
in
the
minds
of
the
people
and
as
the
court
has
said
it's
hard
to
exactly
measure
the
effector
the
danger
of
these
particular
things.
certainly
the
regulation
of
those
things
should
be
left
of
these
immediate
problems,
the
protection
of
the
individual
in
his
own
community
should
be
left
to
the
state,
historically,
it
has
been.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
protection
--
no
sir
the
protection
of
the
health
and
we
might
say
his
property
and
things
of
that
nature.
it's
been
recognized,
but
generally
and
broadly
speaking,
against
physical
entry,
matters
of
public
safety
this
court
has
recognized
even
in
the
case
of
interstate
commerce
which
the
federal
government
has
completely
preempted
that
the
states
still
historically
retain
police
power
in
certain
fields
such
--
in
that
connection,
we
might
say
in
regulating
traffic,
speed
laws,
weight
limits.
although
they
might
be
some
burden
on
interstate
commerce
indirectly,
the
state
still
has
that
right
to
conduct
that
regulation.
now
in
the
field
of
sedition
we
do
have
damage
to
the
individuals
in
a
local
area.
in
the
case
of
riot
or
the
other
disorders,
we
have
said
--
just
take
for
example
in
the
city
of
austin,
probably
150
policemen
and
15
or
20
deputy
sheriffs,
while
there
are
only
three
fbi
agents.
now
certainly
the
federal
government
is
not
intending
to
protect
the
local
citizens
and
congress
i
do
not
believe
has
intended
to
protect
the
local
citizen
in
the
area
that
could
be
covered
by
the
states
in
that
particular
field.
to
do
so,
they
would
have
to
of
course
either
station
troops
or
increase
the
size
of
the
fbi
by
50
times.
and
i
do
not
believe
that
congress
would
do
either
of
those
things.
so
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
for
two
reasons
whether
statutes
were
unconstitutional
on
which
it
is
--
or
it
was
improper
--
it
was
an
illegal
warrant
because
it
was
improperly
executed
or
improperly
issued.
if
--
i
would
state
if
i
