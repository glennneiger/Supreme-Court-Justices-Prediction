chief

alright.
well,
now
let
me
ask
you
this,
are
all
of
these
--
is
it
illegal
for
anyone
to
own
these
books
that
are
--
that
were
taken?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
any
of
it
that
would
be
illegal
to
--
for
an
individual
to
possess?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
would
a
man
--
would
he
make
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
say
you're
not
familiar
with
this
material,
how
about
the
men
who
executed
this
part?
are
they
familiar
with
the
--
with
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
items?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
types
but
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
items
have
they
seen?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
know
then
that
it's
the
same
type?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
read
all
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
read
all
these
books?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
how
would
they
know
then?
would
they
take
it
by
the
titles?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
noticed
here
that
you
took
the
book
entitled,
“a
catholic
speaks
on
cuba”
by
the
fair
play
for
cuba
committee.
i
suppose
that
they
also
have
the
holy
bible
there
for
the
catholics
to
use
excerpts
from
to
establish
his
position
about
fair
play
to
cuba,
would
the
bible
then
become
an
instrument
of
crime?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
--
how
do
you
distinguish
that
from
any
other
books?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it's
used
for
that
purpose
as
you
say,
that's
the
principal
thing
that
enables
you
to
take
these
things,
so
how
do
you
distinguish
the
bible
from
this
document
itself,
“a
catholic
speaks
on
cuba”
and
obviously
he
speaks
as
a
catholic
in
favor
of
the
cuba
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
had
anybody
read
these
books
before
they
were
taken?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
people
who
took
them
ever
vouched
for
the
communist
character
of
them
after
they
were
taken
as
a
result
of
their
reading?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overpal)
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
read
that
somebody
had
told
him
and
showed
them
these
were
books
that
were
pro-communist
and
then
they
take
all
of
these.
now
has
anybody
read
these
books
and
determined
that
they
were
subversive
and
that
they
were
instruments
of
crime
or
could
be
used
as
instruments
of
crime?
chief
justice
earl
warren
whether
they
were
for
or
against
the
party?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
that
can
be
sustained?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
purpose
of
this
--
with
this
case
(inaudible)
of
the
search
warrant,
the
(inaudible).
this
is
a
violation
against
the
complete
order
(inaudible).

justice
earl
warren

chief
justice
earl
warren
