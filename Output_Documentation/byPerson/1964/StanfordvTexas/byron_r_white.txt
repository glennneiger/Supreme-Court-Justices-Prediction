justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
maverick,
could
i
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
interrupt
you
just
a
moment
please.
i
--
you
listed
off
the
--
these
contentions
which
you're
going
to
expound
us
on
in
a
minute,
but
do
those
include
an
attack
on
the
statute,
on
its
face
other
than
section
9?
justice
byron
r.
white
other
than
as
applied
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
just
by
the
issuance
of
the
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
that
--
i
suppose
that
you'd
be
--
assuming
that
the
statutes
on
their
face
are
constitutional
i
would
think
you
can
imagine
the
situation
which
a
search
warrant
might
be
valid.
but
if
the
statutes
are
just
unconstitutional
themselves
on
their
face,
well
no
search
warrants
would
be
valid.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
which
do
you
--
which
contention
are
you
making
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
aside
from
the
statute
in
operation
of
this
case,
i
take
it
your
constitutional
attack
on
the
statute
is
of
--
is
one
of
preemption?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
maverick
did
you
make
this
argument
in
the
state
court
--
in
the
state
supreme
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
these
--
the
warrant
authorized
seizing
publications
concerning
the
communist
party
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
were
possessed
or
unlawfully
used
in
violation
of
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
how
was
they
--
could
you
tell
me
with
reference
to
which
section
of
the
act
the
officers
were
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
what
section
9
but
all
that
--
that
refers
again
to
a
violation
of
the
act.
and
in
looking
over
--
to
live
up
to
the
warrant,
a
fellow
was
making
the
search
would
have
to
say,
"well,
here
is
a
book
written
by
c.
wright
mills".
now,
it's
--
i
first
have
to
determine
whether
it's
pro-communist
or
know
whether
it
concerns
the
communist
party
and
secondly
whether
it's
being
used
in
violation
of
the
act.
now,
he
looks
at
the
book
and
he's
determined
this
--
its
--
concerns
the
communist
party.
but
then
how
does
he
determine
its
being
used
in
violation
of
the
act?
what
part
of
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
could
he
live
up
to
the
search
warrant
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
without
knowing
what
violation
he
is
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
saying
it
has
to
be
in
the
search
warrant
(inaudible)
but
i
--
i
would
think
that
before
you
could
seize
a
book
by
c.
wright
mills
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he
was
just
looking
--
were
there
any
saying
that
the
communist
party
have
used
in
this
operation?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
was
that
seizable?
why
was
the
material
that
has
been
used
in
these
meetings
seizable?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
but
it
--
that
all
that
section
says
is
you
may
seize
things
that
are
in
violation
of
the
act.
now,
why
is
the
material
used
at
a
--
at
an
alleged
communist
meeting
--
why
is
that
material
itself
and
its
distribution
in
violation
of
the
act?
that's
my
question,
i
mean
the
--
all
section
9
does
says
is
that
you
may
seize
things
in
connection
with
violation
to
the
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
used
in
violation
of
the
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
what's
the
violation
of
the
act
in
materials
that
are
passed
out
of
the
communist
party
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
prohibits
the
actual
existence
in
operation.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
if
they
handed
out
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
handed
out
--
your
position
is
that
if
a
communist
party
meeting
in
connection
with
its
proceedings,
they
handed
out
copies
of
the
new
york
times
or
the
washington
post
or
the
washington
star
for
its
members
to
read
and
call
the
attention
to
certain
items
in
it,
those
papers
are
seizeable
as
part
of
the
operations
of
the
party,
that's
your
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
search
warrant
just
says
concerning
the
communist
party.
it
doesn't
say
pro-communist
or
anti-communist,
just
says
concerning.
justice
byron
r.
white
then,
do
you
had
any
--
that
the
officers
had
just
that
kind
of
authority
to
seize,
didn't
they
under
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
--
i
gather
that
in
the
court
below,
the
big
argument
was
raised
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
nor
was
the
validity
of
the
underlying
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
raised
up
here
(inaudible)
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
the
validity
of
section
9
was
raised
but
not
the
validity
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
should
not
under
--
the
type
of
matters
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
--
that
they
--
and
would
that
(inaudible)
by
the
texas
supreme
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
texas
supreme
court
just
said
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
--
i
gather
your
point.
is
it
that
--
wholly
aside
from
the
contents
of
the
book
--
with
your
--
with
the
--
the
content,
is
it
--
is
irrelevant,
wholly
aside
from
that,
you
may
seize
any
book
because
its
an
instrumentality
no
matter
what
it
says?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn't
there
have
to
be
--
why
shouldn't
there
have
to
be
some
kind
of
a
judicial
hearing
as
to
the
(inaudible)
these
books
in
order
to
take
out
the
circulation
a
book
with
ideas
in
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
might
be
able
to
make
that
--
take
that
thing
after
a
trial,
but
why
should
we
able
to
take
books
out
of
circulation
just
on
probable
cause?
you
might
be
able
take
it
then
out
of
circulation
on
probable
cause
but
maybe
not
a
book.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
--
then
aren't
you
--
seriously,
aren't
you
up
against
the
propositions
that
markets
and
quantity
of
books
do.
i
take
you,
how
can
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
take
out
of
circulation
without
some
connection
with
something
that
--
within
--
the
kind
of
what
you're
talking
about
assuming
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
would
give
it
justification.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes.
but
they
all
have
said
that
there
were
recent
mailings
of
materials
from
this
house
and
there's
no
indication
that
any
specific
books
was
mailed
or
handed
out.
it's
just
sort
of
this
--
the
type
of
thing
that
was
handed
out
but
there's
nothing
in
this
record.
nothing
in
the
application
or
in
the
affidavit
to
indicate
that
any
single
one
of
these
books
that
were
seized
was
handed
out
at
a
communist
party
meeting?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
these
particular
books
by
name?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
know
what
they
were
--
the
informant
was
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
type
of
book.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
warrant
said
they
had
to
be
used
in
violation
of
the
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
only
did
they
have
the
concern
the
communist
party,
but
in
the
officers.
the
opinion
i
gather
they
had
to
be
used
in
violation
of
the
act,
they're
possessed
or
used
in
violation
of
the
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
up
to
the
officers
for
himself
to
determine
whether
(a),
they
are
concerned
with
the
party
or
(b),
they
violated
the
act.
