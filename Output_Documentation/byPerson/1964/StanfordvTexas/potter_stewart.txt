mr.

there
during
the
time,
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
lasted
for
five
hours?
justice
potter
stewart
i
can't
quite
understand
the
quotation
from
mr.
dobie.
justice
potter
stewart
owl?
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
leave
the
factual
context,
was
this
his
home
or
was
it
a
store
or
what's
involved
here?
justice
potter
stewart
it
wasn't
a
retail
bookstore.
justice
potter
stewart
the
public
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
wasn't
invited
in
throughout?
justice
potter
stewart
the
sentence
beginning
if,
this
--
about
eight
lines
from
the
bottom
of
the
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
was
any
of
this
material
returned
by
the
state
after
it
was
seized?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
all
it
was
offered?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
all
that
was
offered?
it
was
all
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
offered
to
be
returned.
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
time
element
between
the
time
of
seizure
and
the
time
of
that
offer,
whatever
the
offer
was?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
it?
how
long
was
it?
what
was
the
time
on?
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
weeks
or
months
between
the
time
of
seizure
and
the
time
of
the
hearing
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
when
this
offer
was
made?
justice
potter
stewart
10
days.
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
a
question
of
state
law,
not
federal
law
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
section
9
requires
it
doesn't
require
--
what
were
listed
here
is
what
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
constitution
requires?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
simply
suggesting
that
what
you've
just
said
should
be
your
argument
rather
than
what
section
9
of
the
texas
statute
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
defined?
justice
potter
stewart
you
haven't
mentioned
(inaudible)
--
uphaus
against
wyman
in
connection
with
your
preemption
argument.
that
rather
cuts
back
the
--
of
what
some
of
the
things
that
were
said
in
nelson
against
pennsylvania,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
since
there
you
get
in
--
there
you
get
into
an
area
that
wasn't
covered
by
uphaus
against
wyman
at
all,
that
is
the
first
amendment
area.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
it
now
you're
addressing
yourself
to
preemption.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
are
other
issues
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
outside
of
this
man's
personal
property
and
records
such
as
his
blue
shield
and
blue
cross,
and
his
marriage
certificate
and
his
driver's
license
and
the
title
to
his
home
and
so
on,
outside
of
that,
all
that
was
seized
there
--
and
you
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong,
were
commercially
published
literature
(inaudible)
--
published
commercially
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
available
in
most
bookstores
everywhere?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
correct
or
am
i
wrong?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
the
validity
of
both
the
state
statutes
are
properly
an
issue
here?
justice
potter
stewart
both
the
statutes
are
referred
to
in
the
affidavit?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
say
they
made
it
both
here.
the
validity
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
both
of
them
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
properly
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
you're
saying
in
effect
is
that
what
was
seized
here
was
evidence
to
be
used
at
a
criminal
trial,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
law
has
been
clear.
justice
potter
stewart
generally,
when
we
talk
about
instrumentality
as
we
talk
about
dynamite
and
firearms
and
narcotics,
contraband.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
law
is
pretty
clear,
the
constitutional
law
is
pretty
clear
isn't
it
that
you
can
under
constitution
seize
mere
evidence
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
under
the
logic
of
your
argument,
at
least
as
i
understand
it,
the
holy
--
the
bible
could
have
been
seized
if
there
were
reasonable
ground
to
believe
that
that
was
being
used
as
a
instrument
of
communist
meetings
to
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
texas
by
force
and
violence.
after
all,
the
bible
has
been
used
for
a
good
many
causes
including
slavery
and
various
other
things.
so
if
i
understand
your
argument,
the
bible
could
have
been
seized
just
as
the
--
as
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
quote
--
my
brother
white,
the
washington
post
and
the
washington
star,
if
subject
to
a
showing
that
this
is
being
used
for
this
criminal
purpose.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
the
book
is
actually
used
or
misused,
misused
if
you
will
to
promote
actual
criminal
(inaudible)
--
violent
criminal
conduct
as
indeed
the
holy
bible
has
been.
it's
been
used
to
support
persecution
of
these
murder
of
the
jews
and
the
--
and
human
slavery
and
the
spanish
inquisition
and
a
good
many
other
things
probably
that
don't
come
into
my
mind
now.
what
if
you
could
show
that
this
was
the
instrumental
on
which
the
--
these
cabal
was
influencing
these
ignorant
and
easily
influenced
people
to
commit
these
terribly
violent
illegal
acts?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
could
be
probably
right.
