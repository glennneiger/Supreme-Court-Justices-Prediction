justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
you've
distinguished,
i
gather
mr.
maverick
that
--
mr.
maverick,
your
preemption
argument
started
in
the
nelson
point,
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
--
but
you
also
suggested
a
first
amendment
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
goes
to
the
constitutionality
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(inaudible)
on
its
face
as
well.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
maverick,
i
think
--
or
perhaps
you've
already
said
and
i'm
sorry
to
ask
you
to
repeat
it,
did
you
say
what
it
was
they
offered
to
give
back
at
--
within
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
personal
items
of
that
kind?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
none
of
these
so-called
seditious
books?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
correspondence,
i
think
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
dissenting
opinions
or
anything
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
said,
it's
just
a
matter
of
interest,
was
it,
the
opinion
when
--
which
others
joined
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
i
find
it
in
the
books,
to
get
the
citation
to
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
have
it
printed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
they
tendered
back?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
they
tendered
back?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
still
have
it,
i
understand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
only
judicial
determination
was
by
a
single
judge
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
barrett
county?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
records
of
an
illegal
business
or
something
else
again
that
the
profit
and
loss
ledger
of
a
gambler
violating
the
federal
wagering
stamp
act
or
something,
that's
something
else.
we're
here
talking
though
about
books
by
leftwing
and
communist
authors
largely
which
is
sold
generally
around
in
the
bookstores
around
the
country.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
the
book
has
to
be
one
that
has
ideas?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
you're
in
real
trouble.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
there
any
proof
of
that
kind.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
at
the
--
then
he
--
of
the
--
at
the
magistrate's
hearing
after
the
warrant
issuance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
can
you
do
this;
how
can
you
issue
a
warrant,
for
instance,
some
showing
of
something
like
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
with
ideas
embodied
in
books?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
(inaudible)
distinguish
this
from
the
quantity
of
books
or
they
had
seven
books
before
the
magistrate
and
the
basis
of
that
as
i
recall
it,
he
said
they
could
pick
up
52
other
titles,
and
we
said
that
wasn't
enough,
the
first
amendment
wouldn't
allow
that
kind
of
thing
in
a
seizure
procedure,
now
how
does
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
as
i
recall
it,
what
the
element
there
is
that
even
on
the
basis
of
seven
published
by
the
same
publisher
which
couldn't
have
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
would
pick
up
about
39
other
titles.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
one,
how
this
was
different?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i
gather
that
someone
used
a
copy
of
the
bible
to
beat
someone
else
over
the
head
and
killed
him,
a
seizure
of
that
copy
of
the
bible
as
an
instrumentality
of
the
crime,
no
question
about
that.
now
i
understand
what
you're
telling
us
to
do
as
in
effect
you're
saying,
these
books,
as
they
want
to
proceed,
were
used
in
that
same
sense.
there
were
contraband
in
the
same
sense
that
these
were
being
used
in
connection
with
the
violation
of
the
act,
but
where
is
--
there
any
showing
of
that,
because
an
officer
went
into
the
magistrate
and
said
--
given
a
copy
of
the
bible
in
stanford's
house
and
it
was
used
to
kill
somebody,
i
warrant
--
want
a
warrant
to
go
and
get
it.
(inaudible)
do
we
have
anything
like
that
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
how
--
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
i
don't
see
how
you
have
an
answer
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
if
you
have
to
concede.
there's
no
determination
of
that.
it
was
justified,
the
characterization
of
these
as
being
used
in
connection
with
a
violation
of
the
act.
