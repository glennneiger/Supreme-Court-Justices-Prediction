mr.
justice
bernnan
did
they
search
him
for
something
at
the
police
station?
mr.
justice
bernnan
did
they
book
him
--
did
they
book
him
for
anything?
mr.
justice
bernnan
so
he
was
not
booked
until
after
he
was
searched,
is
that
it?
mr.
justice
bernnan
that
was
at
the
time
they
stopped
his
car
that
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
arrest
then?
mr.
justice
bernnan
so
this
search
of
-
of
his
person
purported
to
be
in
any
event
related
to
that
arrest
for
felony,
is
that
it?
mr.
justice
bernnan
let's
see
if
i
can
understand
this
--
mr.
justice
bernnan
he's
arrested
for
the
felony?
mr.
justice
bernnan
but
after
they
had
searched
him
they
actually
prosecuted
him
only
for
the
misdemeanor
possessing
the
things
that
they
found
out,
is
that
it?
mr.
justice
bernnan
and
it's
that
that
conviction
that
we
have
before
the
court?
mr.
justice
bernnan
well
from
what
you've
told
us
about
the
operation
of
this
kind
of
crime
would
you
contend
that
there
would
have
been
probable
cause
if
all
of
that
had
happened,
that
no
informer,
that
the
officer
in
this
particular
kind
of
work
as
you
say
is
specialist,
knowing
this
fellow
who
was
engaged
in
it
was
in
an
area
where
he
knew
that
kind
of
thing
was
going
on
and
stopped
him?
mr.
justice
bernnan
well,
our
cases
are
against
as
to
that
of
course
where
--
mr.
justice
bernnan
--
the
officer
says
that
the
informer
is
one
who
has
given
them
information
before
which
he
found
reliable,
do
we
have
that
here?
mr.
justice
bernnan
but
why
--
why
then
within
our
cases
you
have
to
satisfy
to
the
requirements
of
probable
cause.
mr.
justice
bernnan
and
if
--
if
that
you
would
now
on
the
premise,
mr.
mcknight
as
i
understood
you
to
make
that
it
would
not
be
enough
without
the
information
from
the
informant
that
the
crux
of
this
case
probable
cause
is
whether
this
supplies
the
deficiency
when
in
this
instance
if
you
please
there's
no
indication
that
the
informer
was
a
reliable
informant
in
a
sense
to
be
defined.
mr.
justice
bernnan
well
he
might
not
have
to
divulge
it
that
i
--
i
suggest
that's
probably
settled
against
your
adversary
in
the
case
where
the
police
officer
can
say
that
he
had
relied
on
this
fellow
before
and
had
found
him
rely
--
his
information
reliable,
but
that's
--
that's
missing
in
this
instance.
mr.
justice
bernnan
well
mr.
mcknight
you
know
of
any
case
of
ours
in
which
in
reliance
on
an
informer
we
have
not
consistent
that
the
informer
being
one
upon
previously
the
officer
had
relied?
mr.
justice
bernnan
well
my
point
is
though
in
this
instance
it
could
well
have
been
that
the
officer
had
a
hunch
that
this
fellow
would
be
there
and
if
he
were
there
he
was
going
to
have
policy
slips
on
him
as
indeed
proved
that
he
did.
now
how
was
that
any
better
or
how
was
it
any
better
that
some
informer
had
a
hunch
that
he
was
going
to
be
there
and
then
he
would
have
policy
slips
on
him
when
he'd
never
had
that
kind
of
information
from
this
informer
before,
well
how
is
that
any
different?
