mr.
william
t.
mcknight
may
it
please
the
chief
justice,
all
of
the
justices
in
the
court.
first
of
all
i'd
like
to
say
this
because
it
may
account
for
counsel
for
the
petitioner
having
in
mind
some
things
which
counsel
for
the
state
of
ohio
doesn't.
i
was
not
informed
of
any
of
these
facts
until
the
file
was
given
to
me
to
prepare.
so
i
am
of
necessity
bound
by
the
record
which
has
been
filed
in
this
court.
and
alluding
to
that
record,
i
have
to
take
exception
to
what
my
worthy
opponent
said
that
in
anywhere
in
this
record
mr.
beck
was
asked
or
that
he
voluntarily
gave
the
time
at
which
he
got
this
information
from
the
informer.
there's
nothing
in
this
record
about
time
except
that
the
informer
said
if
you
go
to
115th
in
beulah
avenue
at
about
one
o'clock
pm
there
you
will
find
william
beck
and
he
will
have
on
him
some
number
slips.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
number
10
--
page
10.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
then
you'd
--
if
you
begin
there
about
the
arrest,
“then
you
didn't
have
any
arrest
that
you
knew
of
as
far
as
1960.”
“not
to
my
knowledge.”
“you
indicated
that
you
were
upgrading
on
information?”
‘yes.”
“for
whom
did
you
get
this
information?”
“i
can't
divulge
that
information.”
answer
--
oh,
question:
“i
didn't
understand
your
answer.”
“i
couldn't
divulge
that
information.”
question:
“but
somebody
specifically
did
relate
that
information
to
you.”
“yes.”
“and
you
knew
who
that
person
was.”
now
that
is
the
time
that
when
he
asked
about
whom
the
informant
was.
and
then
we
turn
back
to
the
original
questions
on
page
5
of
the
record
when
mr.
willis
was
making
the
examination
in
court.
and
we
asked
the
sergeant's
name,
“you
participated
in
the
arrest
of
william
beck.”
“that
was
on
november
10.”
were
you,
oh
--
where
approximately
was
it
where
you
arrested
mr.
beck?”
“i
arrested
him
on
beulah
avenue
just
off
115
street
at
one
o'clock
on
that
date.”
“beulah
is
between
ashford?”
“about
what
time
was
that?”
and
then
he
gives
“it
was
few
minutes
before
1
pm.”
now
on
page
6,
when
it
began
“you
called
him
to
pullover?”
“i
identified
myself
and
request
him
to
pullover.”
“then
you
searched
him?”
“prior
to
that,
did
you
indicate
to
him
that
he
was
under
arrest?”
“not
while
searching
the
auto.”
“in
other
words
you
searched
the
automobile
before
you
placed
him
under
arrest?”
answer:
“i
placed
him
under
arrest
just
as
we
were
searching
the
auto.”
“prior
to
that
time
you
had
not
discovered
anything
that
--
that
was
illegal
other
than
a
hunting
knife.
why
then
did
you
place
him
under
arrest?”
“i
placed
him
under
arrest
for
a
clearing
house
operation
scheme
of
chance.”
question:
“at
that
time
you
had
discovered
some
evidence
of
the
scheme
of
chance?”
answer:
“i
did
not.”
question:
“at
the
time
you
placed
him
under
arrest
you
did
not
have
any
evidence?”
answer:
“other
than
information.”
question:
“in
other
words,
you
heard
rumors?”
answer:
“i
heard
reports
and
found
that
he
had
a
record
in
connection
with
clearing
house
in
scheme
of
chance.”
question:
“previous
convictions,
that's
in
the
plural.”
answer:
“yes.”
question:
“on
this
information
you
arrested
him
on
the
city
streets
on
beulah
avenue,
you
searched
the
automobile?”
now,
throughout
the
record
it
shows
that
all
of
these
information,
the
officer
testified
under
oath
came
to
him
from
an
informer.
and
i
wish
to
make
the
point
that
there
is
no
--
there
was
no
inquiry
as
to
what
time
he
got
this
information
because
that
would
be
important
as
to
whether
or
not
this
officer
on
a
special
squad
had
time
to
go
to
a
magistrate
and
attempt
to
get
a
warrant.
further
in
the
record
he
says
when
he
was
asked
why
he
didn't
get
a
warrant.
he
says
“i
couldn't
get
a
warrant
on
this
kind
of
information.”
now
we
have
to
assume
what
he
means,
that
is
from
information,
from
an
informer
who
didn't
--
he
doesn't
even
say
who
was
the
informer,
disclosed
at
that
time
who
he
was
and
whether
he
was
dependable,
but
using
the
phrase
that
mr.
justice
stewart
used
this
morning
about
the
facts
of
life,
i
would
like
to
be
permitted
to
comment
on
this
particular
crime
and
first
i
would
like
to
bring
the
court's
attention
to
the
word
of
this
crime
as
in
the
revised
code
of
ohio
which
as
counsel
has
told
you
became
effective
september
1st,
1961
approximately
two
months
before
this
arrest.
now
this
is
the
revised
code
2915.111.
"no
person
shall
own,
possess,
have
on
or
about
this
person,
have
in
his
custody,
or
have
under
his
control
a
ticket,
order,
or
device
for
or
representing
a
number
of
shares
or
an
interest
in
a
scheme
of
chance
known
as
policy,'
numbers
game,'
clearing
house,'
or
by
words
or
terms
of
similar
import,
located
in
or
to
be
drawn,
paid,
or
carried
on
within
or
without
this
state.”
now,
this
is
the
penalty
which
determines
whether
or
not
it
would
be
a
misdemeanor
or
a
felony.
"whoever
violates
this
section
shall
be
fined
not
more
than
five
hundred
dollars
and
imprisoned
not
more
than
six
months
for
a
first
offense.
for
each
subsequent
offense,
such
person
shall
be
fined
not
less
than
five
hundred
nor
more
than
one
thousand
dollars
and
imprisoned
not
less
than
one
nor
more
than
three
years.
now
under
the
laws
of
ohio,
any
penalty
which
is
required
to
be
imposed
of
more
than
a
year
makes
it
a
felony.
in
this
case
as
the
record
show
william
beck
was
charged
under
section
2915.111
and
since
this,
on
second
offense
caused
for
a
felony
conviction,
then
we
should
apply
the
rules
as
to
what
a
police
officer
must
do
in
order
to
make
an
arrest
and
an
incidental
search
thereto
when
he
is
in
his
opinion
convinced
that
a
felony
is
being
committed.
now,
the
commission
of
this
felony
is
having
on
your
person
in
these
things.
and
whether
or
not
this
police
officer,
sergeant
delajo
knew
it
or
not
so
long
as
this
petition
or
any
other
person
had
about
him
concealed
evidences
of
participating
in
this
gambling
game,
the
felony
was
being
committed.
now
that
must
be
borne
in
mind
when
we
apply
the
test
as
to
what
the
officer
was
required
to
do
in
affecting
his
arrest.
and
in
the
record
he
says
“i
went
out
to
look
for
this
man
and
if
i
found
him
i
intended
to
arrest
him.”
he
did
find
him.
he
found
him
at
the
time
and
place
that
he
was
informed
he
would
be
there.
now
he
stopped
his
car,
he
asked
him
to
pullover.
he
pulled
over.
he
searched
the
car.
now
there's
nothing
in
the
record
saying
that
the
evidence
of
gambling
would
be
in
the
car
or
on
the
person
who
was
driving
the
car
or
who
was
the
passenger
in
the
car.
and
so
that's
of
course
would
have
to
remain
for
the
officer
to
use
his
judgment
and
being
on
the
special
investigation
squad
and
having
much
experience,
he
would
take
an
approach
perhaps
different
from
anyone
of
us
or
certainly
any
lay
person
in
his
approach.
he
searched
the
car,
and
then
he
says
in
the
record,
“i
placed
him
under
arrest
while
i
was
searching
the
car.”
he
found
nothing
in
the
car
and
that
wasn't
unusual.
what
would
have
been
unusual
is
for
these
number
slips
to
be
lying
out
on
the
seat
of
the
car?
it
would
be
expected
that
they
would
be
on
the
person
and
so
he
placed
him
under
arrest,
took
him
to
the
fifth
district
station,
on
117
chester,
and
there
searched
the
person
as
the
individual.
now,
i
can
imagine
the
hue
and
cry
that
would
have
gone
up,
if
a
police
officer
asked
william
beck
to
step
out
on
the
street
and
he
had
started
taking
off
his
clothes
to
see
if
they
had
secreted
about
his
person
number
slips
that
would
have
made
the
front
page.
so
we
took
him
to
a
precinct
station
and
there
arrest
--
searched
him
and
found
in
his
socks
an
envelope
containing
these
slips.
now
here
the
significant
in
this
case
and
i
wish
to
call
it
to
the
court's
attention
because
just
so
recently,
the
mapp
case
from
our
state
had
been
reported.
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
at
any
time
william
beck
was
mistreated,
that
he
resisted
arrest,
that
he
was
manhandled,
and
the
trial
consisted
solely
of
a
stipulation
suggested
to
and
entered
in
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner.
that
the
inquiry
made
to
support
his
motion
to
suppress
was
all
of
the
evidence
that
was
available
and
it
was
stipulated
that
that
evidence
should
be
the
evidence
considered
for
the
court
to
determine
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
petitioner.
now,
if
there
were
any
other
facts
of
significance
which
counsel
thought
the
court
should
know
or
which
he
thought
would
aid
his
client
in
being
acquitted,
then
certainly
he
had
the
opportunity
to
go
forward
because
the
trial
judge
asked
“are
you
ready
to
go
forward
gentlemen?”
it
was
then
that
it
was
announced
that
this
case
would
be
submitted
on
stipulation
of
counsel.
now,
that
is
significant
because
much
of
what
surrounds
this
is
not
before
the
court.
and
so
at
this
point
i
would
like
to
have
the
liberty
and
again
alluding
to
the
factual
situation,
we're
talking
about
the
conduct
of
a
gambling
operation
which
is
based
on
a
number
being
determined
everyday
by
the
results
of
the
number
of
shares
of
stocks
sold
on
and
agreed
exchange,
maybe
it's
the
new
york
stock
exchange
or
maybe
another
exchange
which
is
known
to
the
players.
the
players
have
to
place
their
number
written
on
a
piece
of
paper
at
a
particular
place.
and
then
the
next
operation
is
that
others
come
and
collect
these
pieces
of
paper
with
some
identification
as
to
who
the
owner
is
and
takes
them
to
another
place.
and
this
operation
has
to
be
carried
on
in
almost
split
--
split
second
time
because
it's
all
over
in
a
few
hours
and
each
day
is
complete
in
itself.
and
if
the
man
who
is
in
the
pick
up
man,
whose
duty
it
is
to
collect
these
numbers
and
take
them
to
the
place
where
they're
registered
fails
to
get
there
on
the
minute,
now
remember
there
have
been
articles
on
the
newspapers
to
the
effect
that
some
late
players
had
contact
with
new
york
and
they
went
away
with
the
killing
because
the
number
had
been
announced
before
the
numbers
had
been
placed
with
the
house
that
paid
off.
now
all
of
that
is
most
important
in
the
consideration
of
the
rights
of
this
petitioner
because
it
goes
to
the
gravamen
of
this
case
as
to
whether
or
not
this
police
officer
acted
in
view
of
all
the
circumstances
on
information
which
came
to
him
and
the
record
doesn't
say
how
long
before
one
o'clock
and
he
was
told
that
he
got
there
at
one
what
he
would
find.
now
from
reading
the
petitioner's
brief
--
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
yes
--
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
yes.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
well,
i
will
interpret
that
from
the
knowledge
that
has
come
to
me
not
being
assigned
to
the
criminal
division
and
being
on
the
appellate
where
i
just
read
what
happened,
but
to
me
it
means,
that
the
police
officer
could
not
with
the
fragmentary
information
that
he
had,
nothing
more
than
time,
place,
the
name
of
person,
and
what
was
to
be
found,
could
go
to
a
magistrate
and
say
“i
just
had
a
tip
and
this
is
what
i've
been
told,
and
so
on
information
and
belief
and
i
believe
this
information,
i
wish
to
make
an
affidavit
and
have
a
warrant
issued.”
now,
he
couldn't
know
and
that
was
why
i
wouldn't
know
how
this
game
is
played,
he
could
know
that
he
would
catch
up
with
this
automobile
at
115th
in
beulah.
and
if
the
warrant
were
definite
as
to
place
and
he
asked
for
a
warrant
for
115th
in
beulah,
but
--
and
this
could
have
been
just
as
true
than
the
case
in
california,
the
ker,
he
may
have
had
the
chases
although
if
he
had
got
a
glance
and
knew
that
this
was
delajo
and
most
of
the
men
in
the
business
knew
delajo.
if
he
had
seen
delajo,
he
might
have
speeded
up
ad
he
might
have
been
six
blocks
or
a
mile
away
before
he
could
curb
him.
and
he
had
in
his
pocket
a
warrant
authorizing
him
to
make
an
arrest
at
115th
in
beulah.
then
the
question
would
be
here
as
to
whether
or
not
he
with
that
warrant
could
make
an
arrest
a
mile
away.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
i
haven't
seen
a
warrant
made
out
to
intercept
an
automobile
at
a
particular
point.
most
warrants
are
for
a
building
which
is
stationary,
a
search
--
you
search
the
premises
--
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
arrest
warrant
wouldn't.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
i
would
say
if,
and
the
record
is
silent
on
that,
if
this
were
something
and
let
me
make
this
kind
of
analogy,
they
just
said
each
day
plays
a
separate
event.
now
if
there
were
a
number
of
men
planning
to
rob
a
bank
at
a
time
in
the
future,
many
days
on
and
there
came
a
tip
and
the
police
officers
were
organizing
themselves
to
be
present
at
the
bank,
i
would
say
that
there
was
ample
opportunity
on
the
information
that
it
comes
to
that
to
get
a
warrant
to
make
an
arrest
of
the
persons
at
that
place.
but
to
keep
up
with
the
numbers
game,
the
number
of
writers,
the
number
of
pickup
men
and
the
--
another
fact
of
life
is
that
the
place
where
the
numbers
are
turned
in
it
changed
whenever
the
man
where
they
are
left
to
get
to
an
idea
that
that
too
many
police
officer
cars
that
can't
be
identified
in
the
neighborhood,
the
word
goes
out
to
morally
impeding
that
interest.
i
mean,
that
the
whole
operation
is
fluent
rather
than
--
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
i
think
this
--
i
think
that
the
sergeant
delajo
has
furthered
and
he
would
have
had
to
go.
in
the
matter
of
the
depth
of
this,
time
and
place,
i
think
that
he
had
information
from
an
informant
that
on
this
day
william
beck
would
be
a
pick
up
man
for
the
hour
and
he
would
have
numbers,
wherever,
you
find
him
between
ten
and
one.
he
will
have
on
his
person
a
number
slips
for
a
certain
house.
now
that
may
have
been
all
of
the
information
the
informant
had
because
when
we
speak
about
the
weight
to
be
given
to
the
information
coming
from
an
informer,
i
think
we're
all
are
conscious
of
the
type
of
people
who
are
informers.
now
you
have
to
be
close
enough
to
the
operation
to
get
this
kind
of
information.
as
we
heard
in
the
argument
preceding
this
one
who
would
be
around
still
except
someone
having
some
interest
in
the
operation
of
making
moon-shining.
now
who
would
have
the
information
such
as
this
informer
except
someone
close
enough
to
the
operation
of
this
game
so
that
he
could
know
that
william
beck
was
carrying
for
this
house
that
would
have
to
deposit
the
slips
collected
at
this
house
at
one
o'clock.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
well,
the
evidence
may
now
permitted
to
stand
mr.
justice
white
but
it
was
true,
he
found
just
exactly
what
he
was
looking
for
on
beck,
it
was
true.
i
think
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
legal
matter,
was
he
permitted
to
take
it
off
of
beck
under
the
circumstance.
it
was
true,
at
one
o'clock,
at
115th
in
beulah
william
beck
had
number
slips
on
his
possession
--
in
his
possession.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
well,
i
think
it
--
since
as
i
said,
the
case
was
tried
on
the
questions
that
were
propounded
in
support
of
the
motion.
i
would
say
that
it
enable
a
lawyer
questioning
the
police
officer
wouldn't
go
beyond
asking
the
questions,
the
answers
to
which
would
help
support
his
case,
i
mean
that's
what
a
trial
lawyer
is
expected
to
do
on
either
side.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
yes.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
he
--
he
said
that
the
informer
told
him
where
he
would
find
him.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
well,
you
see
there
could
be
more
than
one
interpretation
on
making
his
doubt.
now
using
that
phraseology,
a
stop,
if
i
read
that
i
would
think
that
the
officer
meant
a
pick
up
not
at
the
place
where
he
would
finally
deposit
these
shares.
pick
up,
these
pick
up
men
go
to
various
places
where
they
are
accumulated
where
the
players
have
left
them.
they
gather
them
up
and
then
they
take
them
to
wherever
they
are
told
to
take
them
for
that
day
so
that
it
could
be
tabulated.
now
when
he
said
make
a
stop,
i
am
assuming
and
it
is
in
the
record
that
he
hadn't
seen
this
man
for
sometime
and
i
think
that
the
arrest
that
he
knew
of
were
in
1959,
i
believe
that
is
the
year,
that
he
was
waiting
for
the
man
to
do
some
act
in
his
presence
which
would
confirm
to
him,
since
there
had
been
a
lapse
of
time
between
the
prior
convictions
and
this
particular
date
that
that
act
coupled
with
what
he
had
learned
and
the
record,
maybe
he
was
back
in
the
business,
and
he
was
waiting
for
a
stop.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
well,
i
would
–
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
i
would
say
that
on
the
observation
of
the
police
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
person
who
has
had
a
former
conviction
is
acting
in
his
presence.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
he
was
driving
along
lawfully
and
they
curbed
him
that's
what
the
record
says.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
lawfully
upon
the
street,
115th
street,
when
delajo
and
the
other
officers
in
his
car
curbed
him
and
he
pulled
in
front
of
him
and
drove
him
to
the
curb.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
i
would
say
ordinarily
not.
in
the
instant
case
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
i
would
say
it
because
the
information
that
he
received
as
to
what
would
happen
at
about
that
time
and
place
did
happen.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
no,
no.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
no
--
no.
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
he
was
told
that
this
man
would
be
committing
a
felony.
he
knew
he
had
three
prior
convictions.
so
if
he
were
found
with
these
slips
on
his
person
or
he
had
them
on
his
person,
the
moment
he
put
them
on
his
purse
and
he
was
committing
a
felony,
whether
or
not
the
officer
could
see
it.
now
if
it
is
a
misdemeanor
you
don't
have
to
see
him
committing
it
in
his
presence
or
having
a
warrant,
but
if
he
had
in
his
possession
these
slips
after
prior
conviction,
the
mere
possession
of
them
whether
they
could
be
seen
or
not
was
the
commission
of
a
felony.
when
he
was
told
that
his
man
would
have
these
slips,
he
was
told
that
this
man
would
be
committing
a
felony
and
when
the
man
drove
by
him,
if
he
believed
the
information
that
came
to
him,
then
he
believed
that
a
felony
was
being
committed
in
his
presence
by
possession
and
it
does
to
say
possession
which
is
obvious
by
the
paraphernalia
being
in
site,
is
just
having
on
your
person,
and
i'm
sure
that
the
members
of
the
general
assembly
when
they
wrote
this
had
in
mind
that
if
in
all
likelihood
the
possession
would
be
supreme
and
would
be
where
you
couldn't
see
it.
but
he
was
committing
a
felony
by
having
it
on
his
person
whether
or
not
these
police
officers
saw
him
or
stopped
him
or
not.
so
as
to
whether
he
would
justify
it
in
making
an
arrest,
it
depended
on
whether
he
believed
a
felony
was
being
committed
in
his
view
and
one
was
being
committed.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
no,
he'd
have
to
have
some
information,
some
probable
cause,
the
probable
cause
with
the
information
no
matter
how
it
came.
in
this
instance,
it
came
from
an
informer.
and
the
only
thing
that
i
can
see
the
petitioner
has
before
this
court
now
is
a
request
that
this
court
say
that
there
shall
be
no
faceless
or
nameless
informer
and
that
every
informer
must
stand
up
and
be
counted
before
a
police
officer
and
conduct
an
arrest
and
a
search.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
that's
right.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
he
--
he
doesn't
say
that
it
is
reliable.
he
says
that
the
--
the
informer
told
him
about
this
case.
he
doesn't
even
say
that
he
had
had
any
prior
contact
with
this
particular
informer.
we
--
we
don't
know
from
the
record
--
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
--
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
in
my
opinion
yes,
that
would
be
the
--actually
that
he
would
have
to
have
information
from
some
source
but
he
would
not
have
to
divulge
the
name
of
the
informer
--
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
well,
i
think
that
it
could
--
informer
whom
he
had
never
heard
because
it
could
very
well
had
be
it,
if
we're
just
speculating,
his
informant
could
have
been
someone
in
the
department
who
is
an
undercover
man
and
who
had
–
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
no,
but
in
the
cases
that
i've
read
from
this
court,
i
think
that
the
language
used
is
where
the
informer
participates
in
some
way
in
the
arrest
or
had
some
connection
with
the
commission
of
the
crime
where
he
did
more
than
just
give
information.
i
don't
think
that
i
have
read
a
case
where
all
he
did
was
give
information
and
had
no
connection
with
it
that
he
had
to
have
had
prior
connection
with
him
and
had
received
information
before
which
he
had
found
reliable.
so
that
in
the
instant
case
he
would
know
that
this
was
a
reliable
informer.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
well,
i
don't
know
that
it
is
particularly
any
different
other
than
the
oath
of
the
officer
who
didn't
make
it
for
the
purpose
of
getting
a
warrant
before
a
magistrate
but
on
being
called
into
open
court
and
put
under
oath
and
query
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
remember
he
was
in
the
court
and
he
was
saying
all
of
these,
now,
it's
just
a
question
whether
he
was
to
be
believed
when
counsel
suggested
that
he
may
have
fabricated
this
because
that
just
become
a
matter
of
credibility
of
the
witness.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
well
i
didn't
want
--
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
well
mr.
justice
white
i
wouldn't
want
the
counsel
to
think
of
me
as
it
expresses
in
his
brief,
you
think
for
the
court
for
having
done
that.
he
doesn't
think
much
of
ohio
courts
for
having
acted
in
that
manner
as
it
is
set
forth
in
the
brief
and
that's
why
i
prefer
to
stick
to
the
record
rather
than
go
beyond
and
just
suppose
things
that
hadn't
been
offered.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
mr.
justice
black
i
said
that
by
reason
of
the
contraband
which
they
expected
to
find
secreted
about
his
person
it
wouldn't
be
the
policy
of
a
police
officer
to
ask
the
man
to
step
out
of
an
automobile
on
the
public
street
and
then
proceed
to
search
his
person
to
find
the
contraband.
now
--
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
search
for
number
slips.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
for
these
slips
that
indicated
that
he
was
engaging
in
this
gambling
game
called
numbers.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
no
sir.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
i
don't
think
i
read
the
preston
brief.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
calif
–
is
that
the
california
case?
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
oh
no
sir,
i
was
thinking
about
the
ker
case
--
no,
sir
i
don't
think
i
read
that
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
you
don't
almost
have
to
because
again
looking
to
the
facts
of
lies,
these
number
slips
have
been
found
on
--
on
pick
up
man
could
secrete
it
everywhere.
i
mean
they
don't
carry
them
openly
and
it's
just
like
we
find
in
other
cases
of
contraband
whether
it's
narcotics
or
what
they
try
to
secrete
it
at
a
place
most
unlikely
to
be
found,
or
certainly
hard
to
get
at.
now,
anticipating
that
not
seeing
it
in
the
car,
if
we
were
going
to
make
a
search
and
we're
going
to
make
a
thorough
and
he
believe
it
is
the
informant
that
they
were
there,
it
might
be
necessary
to
go
down
to
these
barriers
in
before
he
found
what
he
was
looking
for
and
he
wouldn't
want
to
do
that
on
a
public
street.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
they
found
them
in
his
sock,
it
was
secreted
in
his
sock
and
that
was
found
when
he
was
over
the
fifth
precinct
station
on
117
chester.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
well,
if
there
would
be
routine
--
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
it
would
be
routine
if
an
officer
had
information
and
a
man
had
something
on
his
person
and
it
wasn't
readily
identifiable
or
discoverable
by
what
we
call
patting
him
down.
they
didn't
think
it's
as
big
as
gun,
they
do
this
and
they
know
that
he
haven't
gone
there
to
feel
it,
but
he
could
have
an
envelope
at
least
slips
or
in
an
envelope
and
you
could
pat
him
and
never
feel
the
envelope.
you
got
to
get
in
and
find
it
and
if
it
were
secreted
inside,
it
would
mean
undressing
an
individual
almost
because
the
search
of
the
person
isn't
complete
until
every
garment
has
been
removed.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
they
may
have
taken
him
into
the
jail,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
they
had
arrested
him
out
on
beulah.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
and
the
search
was
in
the
jail
that
was
incidental
to
the
arrest.
mr.
william
t.
mcknight
have
you
been
counseled
to
this,
it's
been
even
three,
four
or
ten
years
i'd
have
to
say
no.
