mr.
james
r.
willis
mr.
willis.
mr.
james
r.
willis
mr.
chief
justice
and
justices
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
the
issues
involved
in
this
case
are
indeed
most
significant
in
view
of
some
of
the
decisions
in
this
court,
more
specifically
mapp
versus
ohio
and
ker
versus
california.
it
is
of
course
beyond
dispute
as
has
been
said
but
that
the
constitution
does
prohibit
the
use
by
state
courts
of
evidence
seized
in
violation
of
that
instrument.
further,
ker,
further
begets
the
idea
that
the
standards
to
be
used
are
those
that
have
been
developed
under
the
fourth
amendment
in
cases
decided
in
this
court.
in
the
situation
involving
mr.
beck,
the
evidence
is
very
simple.
the
police
officers
testified
that
they
had
the
information
from
an
unnamed
and
undisclosed
informer
that
william
beck
was
engaged
in
the
violation
of
the
statute
which
prohibited
a
numbers
operation,
this
statute
having
various
ramifications.
the
officer
testified
that
they
had
received
this
information
in
the
morning
and
that
they
left
the
police
station
for
the
purpose
of
arresting
william
beck
on
sight.
mr.
james
r.
willis
there's
no
specific
evidence
in
the
record
which
supports
that
notion.
however,
it
is
a
fact
that
william
beck
lived
in
the
vicinity
where
he
was
arrested.
and
the
information
that
the
officer
related
and
of
course
we
did
not
go
into
that
because
of
the
court's
ruling
which
obviously
was
not
going
to
permit
us
to
bring
this
informer
in
to
actually
determine
whether
or
not
he
even
existed
and
we
take
the
position
that
this
situation
as
enunciated
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
their
opinion
gives
rise
to
the
position
that
has
been
taken
in
our
judgment
by
the
police
in
ohio
that
they
can
merely
say
they
have
information
from
confidential
informers,
and
that
we
are
precluded
by
the
opinion
in
beck
versus
ohio
to
inquire
as
to
whether
or
not
he
even
in
fact
exists.
specifically
in
this
case,
the
officer
testified
that
when
he
saw
william
beck
riding
along
the
street
that
he
stopped
him
and
in
our
judgment
that
at
this
point
this
constituted
an
arrest
if
the
court
meant
what
it
said
in
henry,
this
court
meant
what
it
said
in
the
henry
case.
they
stopped
william
beck
and
they
searched
him
and
at
that
time
they
did
not
find
anything.
they
further
searched
his
car
and
this
likewise
did
not
divulge
anything
of
any
illegal
nature.
be
that
as
it
may,
he
was
taken
down
to
the
police
station
and
subsequently
he
was
searched
as
they
say
more
thoroughly
and
they
found
secreted
in
his
socks
--
mr.
james
r.
willis
apparently
they
were
looking
for
something
to
justify.
mr.
james
r.
willis
yes.
after
they
had
searched
him
he
was
booked
for
possession
of
the
items
that
were
found
on
his
--
mr.
james
r.
willis
it's
not
clear
in
the
record
whether
he
was
but
they
testified
that
they
ar
--
at
the
time
they
arrested
him
and
in
an
answer
to
his
specific
question
asked
by
me
they
said
they
arrested
him
by
carrying
on
a
scheme
of
chance
which
is
a
felony
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
ohio.
mr.
james
r.
willis
yes.
this
was
the
testimony
and
it's
in
the
record.
mr.
james
r.
willis
yes.
at
least
this
is
the
interpretations
that
i
would
place
on
it
because
certainly
they
were
not
at
that
point
looking
for
any
weapons
to
secure
themselves
or
to
prevent
him
from
escape.
i
feel
and
it
is
my
contention
that
they
were
looking
for
something
to
justify
the
arrest.
it
is
significant
that
the
statute
under
which
mr.
beck
was
subsequently
charged
was
enacted
by
the
legislature
of
ohio
only
by
two
months
before
the
time
that
mr.
beck
was
arrested
and
charged
and
this
probably
was
one
of
the
first
cases
that
involved
that
statute,
but
significantly
during
the
trial,
the
police
officer
was
asked
the
name
of
this
alleged
informer.
and
of
course
the
court
ruled
subsequently
that
this
was
irrelevant
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
was
an
arrest,
this
was
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest.
and
of
course
if
we
take
the
position
asserted
by
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
which
i
think
is
a
correct
expression
of
the
law
that
this
arrest
must
stand
or
fall
on
whether
or
not
it
was
consistent
with
the
law.
and
the
law
in
ohio
is
that
you
may
arrest
for
a
felony
if
you
have
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
a
felony
has
been
committed
or
you
can
arrest
for
a
misdemeanor
if
it's
committed
in
your
presence.
now,
it's
significant
here
that
beck
was
charged
with
a
misdemeanor
and
he
was
charged
with
simple
possession
of
the
items
that
had
been
found
in
his
possession.
we
think
this
is
significant
because
the
officer
obviously
did
not
know
he
had
these
items
on
his
person
at
the
time
he
made
the
arrest.
mr.
james
r.
willis
yes.
mr.
james
r.
willis
according
to
the
testimony
(voice
overlap)
yes.
mr.
james
r.
willis
that's
precisely
the
point.
mr.
james
r.
willis
and
it's
that
that
conviction
that
is
before
this
court.
mr.
james
r.
willis
there's
that
notion
expressed
in
the
opinion
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
but
this
is
specifically
is
of
specific
importance
because
that
statute
had
only
been
enacted
in
the
ninth
month
of
1961.
this
case
occurred
within
say
60
days.
he
had
been
arrested
and
it
appears
in
the
record
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
that
he
was
arrested
in
1959
which
was
two
years
before
the
statute
was
enacted
under
which
makes
the
second
offense
a
felony.
mr.
james
r.
willis
in
the
record
there's
testimony
by
the
officer
that
they
knew
william
beck
and
that
they
--
when
they
had
this,
when
they
got
this
information
they
checked
on
the
record
or
whatever
the
police
indexing
system
is
and
they
got
this
information
and
they
had
a
photo
of
william
beck.
so
certainly
they
knew
and
according
to
the
briefs
submitted
by
both
the
amicus
and
by
the
respondent,
these
men
were
specialists
and
they
feel
--
in
the
field
of
purging
out
this
type
of
crime
and
therefore
we
can
assume
that
they
knew
that
the
statute
only
reason
had
been
enacted
because
they
charged
him
under
it,
yes.
mr.
james
r.
willis
no.
carrying
on,
promoting
and
there
are
couples
of
other
charges.
mr.
james
r.
willis
no.
mr.
james
r.
willis
i
--
i
take
the
position
that
it
would
not
be
and
i
feel
that
if
they
proceeded
based
on
the
information
that
you
have
just
suggested
that
that
search
would
be
illegal
on
two
grounds,
one
if
they
had
this
information
at
the
time
they
were
at
the
police
station
then
what
excuse
would
they
have
for
not
having
procured
an
arrest
warrant.
that's
number
one.
yes.
mr.
james
r.
willis
if
the
--
in
that
situation
then
time
may
very
well
be
of
the
essence
and
this
could
very
well
be
what
the
court
was
talking
about
in
ker,
but
we
don't
have
it
in
this
case.
they
claim
they
got
the
information
in
the
morning
and
yet
it
was
one
o'clock
when
they
arrested
william
beck
who
was
proceeding
lawfully
along
the
public
street.
so
what
excuse
can
they
possibly
offer
for
not
having
procured
a
warrant,
providing
they
could
have
qualified
--
qualified
for
one?
and
as
this
court
said
in
wong
sun
whatever
maybe
the
requirements
for
specificity
and
the
particularity
of
the
information
to
arrest
without
a
warrant,
it
certainly
can't
be
less
than
what
it
would
be
if
they
were
attempting
to
get
a
warrant,
that's
the
issue
here.
mr.
james
r.
willis
this
could
--
mr.
james
r.
willis
yes.
but
the
record
doesn't
support
that
contention.
mr.
james
r.
willis
we
have
the
testimony
by
this
officer
that
this
was
what
the
man
had
told
him,
but
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
or
not
this
was
--
but
his
ability
to
imagine
instead
of
facts
that
would
be
sufficient
to
convince
the
trial
court.
it
was
for
that
reason
that
we
wanted
the
informer
so
that
we
could
have
him
there.
here
they're
claiming
--
mr.
james
r.
willis
yes,
i
do
question
it.
i
questioned
even
the
existence
of
--
mr.
james
r.
willis
it's
a
matter
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
resolves
without
the
basis
for
any
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
it.
and
it
is
that
reason
that
we
feel
that
the
former
â€“
informer,
the
phantom
informer
situation
is
present
in
this
case.
and
we
should
have
his
name
in
order
that
we
can
inquire
as
to
his
--
to
his
--
even
to
his
existence,
the
existence.
[recess]
mr.
james
r.
willis
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
referring
mr.
justice
white
to
your
question
as
just
before
the
recess
about
the
idea
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
had
resolved
the
idea
that
these
officers
had
sufficient
information,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
record
there
is
nothing
to
support
their
determination
that
the
police
officers
had
good
information
that
he
was
violating
the
statute.
what
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
is
--
has
apparently
said
is
that,
if
the
police
officers
says
that
he
has
information
from
a
reliable
informer
into
whose
identity
the
defendant
cannot
inquire,
this
constitutes
good
information.
mr.
james
r.
willis
yes
sir.
mr.
james
r.
willis
now,
to
--
the
supreme
court
makes
that
statement,
but
it
does
so
as
a
consequence
of
having
accepted
and
given
for
credibility
to
the
testimony
of
the
officer
who
related
that
the
informer
in
fact
told
him
that
mr.
beck
was
doing
something
in
connection
with
numbers.
and
it
was
on
that
testimony
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
concluded
that
this
was
good
information.
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
we
are
concerned
here
that
the
court
--
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
can
under
the
idea
expressed
in
ker
that
they
can
develop
reasonable
rules
to
facilitate
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
they
can
say
that
if
a
police
officer
testifies
that
he
had
information
from
a
confidential
informer
whose
identity
need
not
be
disclosed
then
the
question
certainly
arises
as
to
whether
or
not
that
notion
is
consistent
with
the
concepts
that
have
been
developed
in
this
court
under
the
rules
of
search
and
seizure
more
specifically
rovario
versus
the
united
states
which
takes
the
position
as
expressed
by
this
court
that
whenever
any
information
is
necessary
to
the
--
to
the
perfection
of
any
defense
then
disclosure
certainly
should
be
required.
there
are
certainly
a
number
of
cases
in
the
federal
circuits
which
support
that
notion.
canty
versus
the
united
states
certainly
expresses
the
notion
that
an
anonymous
informer
can
never
supply
probable
cause.
mr.
james
r.
willis
it
won't
--
mr.
justice
harlan
i
would
take
this
position
that
if
he
merely
stated
the
facts
as
they
are
disclosed
in
this
record
that
it
would
not
have
been
sufficient,
i
feel
that
the
magistrate
certainly
would
have
required
that
he
disclose
the
identity
of
the
informant
to
him
and
indicate
the
predicate
upon
which
he
determines
or
concludes
that
he
is
reliable
because
as
was
stated
in
giordenello
that
it
is
for
the
magistrate
to
determine
the
persuasiveness
of
the
facts
that
are
relied
on
to
determine
the
probable
cause
rather
than
by
the
office
who's
engaged
in
investigating
the
crime.
mr.
james
r.
willis
not
that
i
know
of.
no
sir
--
you're
quite
right
sir,
i
know
of
no
case
where
this
court
has
taken
the
position
that
disclosure
must
be
made
to
the
informant,
however,
in
aguilar
you
get
the
notion
that
certainly
a
sufficient
amount
of
evidence
to
amount
to
probable
cause
in
the
determination
of
the
magistrate
must
be
made.
and
i
feel
that
the
magistrate
would
be
regrade
in
his
duty
if
the
police
officer
merely
stated
that
he
had
reliable
information
from
an
informant
that
someone
was
en
--
someone
was
engaged
in
crime
and
based
on
the
determination
by
the
police
officer
that
he
had
probable
cause
without
any
inquiry
on
behalf
of
the
magistrate
i
feel
would
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
james
r.
willis
this
--
this
is
quite
true.
mr.
james
r.
willis
this
is
quite
true.
and
i
think
that
aguilar
supports
our
notion
because
here
we
only
have
the
statement
of
the
police
officer
that
he
had
received
the
information.
we
cannot
possibly
establish
that
he
did
not
in
fact
receive
such
information
unless
we
know
who
the
informer
was
and
number
two,
we
have
to
at
least
know
whether
or
not
he
exists.
and
here
there
was
no,
not
even
an
attempt
to
disclose
who
the
informer
was.
and
certainly
we
would
not
inquire
as
to
all
of
the
information
that
an
informer
had
supposedly
given
this
officer
because
then
we
would
only
be
limited
by
the
officer's
imagination
knowing
that
the
police
--
i
mean
that
the
court
is
not
going
to
permit
us
to
in
--
to
know
who
the
informer
is
and
thus
bring
him
in
and
therefore
attempt
to
show
that
in
fact
he
does
not
exist
added
that
the
information
given
by
the
informer
was
not
sufficient
or
that
the
officer
was
not
reasonable
in
relying
on
the
supposed
information
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
we
were
concerned
about
knowing
the
identity
of
the
informant.
and
i
feel
--
mr.
james
r.
willis
yes
sir.
mr.
james
r.
willis
mr.
justice
goldberg
i
take
this
added
to
in
reference
to
the
situation
that
you
have
just
outlined.
number
one,
in
jones
versus
the
united
states,
this
court
established
the
notion
that
hearsay
can
be
the
basis
for
the
establishment
of
probable
cause
providing
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
giving
some
credence
or
weight
to
this
hearsay
testimony.
and
it
was
in
rugendorf
that
this
court
again
indicated
that
disclosure
would
not
be
required
because
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
for
accrediting,
i
think
was
the
term
used,
that
hearsay
that
supposedly
had
been
given.
but
in
--
in
this
case,
we
have
here
only
the
statement
by
the
police
officer
which
was
given
after
the
arrest
that
he
had
the
information
before
the
arrest.
this
certainly
lends
itself
to
the
proposition
that
he
might
be
reasoning
ad
hoc
in
an
attempt
to
justify
what
had
occurred.
and
i
think
it
is
for
that
reason
that
this
case
establishes
a
dangerous
precedent
because
we
do
not
know
as
a
fact
that
the
informer
even
existed.
and
i
think
that
merely
for
a
police
officer
to
say
that
i
checked
and
found
out
that
a
man
had
been
convicted
two
years
before
three
times
under
an
ordinance,
that
this
therefore
says
that
he
is
now
convicting
a
newly
enacted
statute.
and
i
think
that
this
situation
certainly
gives
rise
to
a
clear
cut
example
of
why
search
warrants
are
required.
and
i
think
that
at
least
in
these
cases
that
more
is
required
by
way
of
the
disclosure
of
the
identity
of
the
informant.
mr.
james
r.
willis
in
draper
you
had
the
instance
of
an
informer
i
think
his
name
was
marsh
who
had
worked
previously
with
the
government,
and
in
fact
was
a
special
employee
and
was
being
paid
and
he
described
that
draper
would
be
coming
in
from
chicago
into
denver.
he
described
his
gait.
i
think
he
described
the
--
the
manner
he
would
be
dressed
and
that
--
that
he
would
be
carrying
a
valise
or
some
packed
suitcase,
something
of
that
nature.
and
that
he
would
eventually
walk
--
walked
in
a
fast
manner
and
he'd
be
coming
in
a
precise
train.
they
met
the
train
and
lo
and
behold,
the
facts
that
had
been
given
to
them
by
their
paid
government
agent
coincided
with
the
events
as
they
occurred
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
the
arrest
as
apparently
this
court
felt
that
there
was
sufficient
facts
to
justify
the
arrest
without
a
warrant
of
mr.
draper.
mr.
james
r.
willis
yes,
but
--
mr.
james
r.
willis
this
is
quite
true
mr.
justice
clark
but
in
draper
we
had
a
--
a
description
of
facts
which
lay
--
i
mean
a
description
of
events
which
subsequently
occur
as
predicted
by
the
paid
government
agent.
at
least
they
knew
the
informant
there
was
a
basis
for
accepting
the
notion
that
this
man
was
reliable
because
he
had
given
evidence
i
mean
information
in
the
past
that
was
consistent.
we
don't
know
that
this
happened
in
this
case.
we
merely
have
the
officer's
conclusion
that
the
informant
was
reliable
and
we
--
reliable
and
we
have
the
adoption
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
of
his
statement
without
us
having
been
permitted
to
inquire
as
to
the
propriety
of
such
a
determination.
mr.
james
r.
willis
i
think
it
--
you're
quite
right.
they
do
use
that
phrase
and
it
was
also
used
in
aguilar
and
this
court
apparently
felt
that
something
in
addition
to
the
phrase
reliable
information
was
necessary
and
i
call
the
court's
attention
again
to
giordenello
which
takes
the
position,
if
i
understand
the
case
correctly
--
that
it
is
the
magistrate
who
must
draw
the
conclusion
that
probable
cause
exists
rather
than
except
at
face
value
what
has
been
stated
by
the
police
officer.
and
i
agree
with
the
statement
that
has
come
from
this
court.
that
history
has
shown
that
the
police
officers
acting
on
their
own
cannot
be
trusted.
and
i
agree
further
with
the
statement
or
the
idea
that
this
is
the
age
of
the
faceless
informer
and
i
certainly
feel
that
some
protection
should
be
given
to
citizens
so
that
he
would
be
in
a
position
to
at
least
establish
that
in
fact
the
police
officer
is
committing
perjury
when
he
says
he
has
information
if
that
is
the
case.
and
i
feel
that
under
beck
as
it
now
stands
on
the
books
of
ohio
that
this
situation
is
highly
vulnerable
to
a
possibility
and
that's
all
we
have
to
be
concerned
about,
the
possibility
that
by
resort
to
a
fictitious
informant
that
probable
cause
can
be
established
conclusively.
mr.
james
r.
willis
mr.
justice
black
i
would
--
do
precisely
that
and
i
would
take
this
--
mr.
james
r.
willis
no.
i
--
i
--
i
don't
--
mr.
james
r.
willis
i
don't
--
mr.
james
r.
willis
well,
i
think
that
the
trial
judge
in
determining
the
magistrate
if
you
please,
in
determining
whether
or
not
real
--
this
--
this
particularly
informant
is
reliable,
has
a
duty
to
at
least
concern
himself
with
the
issue
rather
than
as
was
done
here
accept
what
was
stated
by
the
police
officer.
and
i
--
and
i
think
that
the
notion
that
maybe
the
trial
is
required
is
at
least
some
additional
protection
which
is
certainly
more
than
what
we
have
in
ohio
where
today
when
a
police
officer
says
he
has
reliable
information,
that
is
a
conclusive
determination
and
we
cannot
assail
it
from
any
posture.
mr.
james
r.
willis
a
case
of
this
kind.
and
significantly
in
ohio
that
is
--
mr.
james
r.
willis
yes,
they
do.
they
would
have
necessarily
have
to
have
direct
evidence
as
to
--
mr.
james
r.
willis
i
think
that
mr.
justice
black's
question
about
preston
is
indeed
salient.
as
we
understand
the
preston
case,
he
assumed
that
the
arrest
was
legitimate
for
vagrancy
and
there
was
a
subsequent
search
of
the
automobile
in
which
this
court
felt
the
warrant
was
required
and
for
that
reason
the
evidence
was
held
to
be
suppressible
and
i
think
--
mr.
james
r.
willis
except
--
mr.
justice
goldberg,
as
i
understand
the
previous
thinking
of
the
court
as
expressed
in
the
rabinowitz
for
example
and
even
in
the
preston
that
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest
is
usually
one
concerned
with
the
event
of
destruction
of
evidence
or
search
a
weapon
as
well.
what
evidence
were
they
looking
for
in
this
case?
now
having
found
the
numbers
doesn't
infer
to
follow
that
they
should
have
charged
him
with
the
felony
rather
than
with
the
possession
of
the
items
that
they
found.
it's
obvious
and
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
question
shows
how
clearly,
at
the
answer
given
by
mr.
mcknight
that
they
would
not
have
charged
him
shows
very
clearly
and
most
cogently
that
this
was
an
exploratory
general
search.
now
we
talk
in
terms
of
the
reliability
of
the
informer
and
again
this
court
in
jones
versus
the
united
states,
you
had
the
informer
stating
the
narcotic
jones
rather
than
the
one
from
georgia,
you
had
the
informer
stating
that
he
had
purchased
narcotics
from
earling
richardson
and
the
jones,
the
cecil
jones
i
believe
it
was
on
a
number
of
occasions.
and
the
officers
knew
that
this
man
was
a
narcotic
user
because
he
evidenced
the
--
the
marks
and
he
knew
that
earling
richardson
and
cecil
jones
were
narcotic
sell
--
users.
and
the
informant
say
that
they
would
find
the
narcotics
in
a
specific
place
and
all
of
these
were
filled
out
in
an
affidavit
which
this
court
barely
affirmed
in
my
judgment
as
being
sufficient.
i
take
the
position
in
this
case
that
the
officer
when
he
took
time
to
go
look
up
this
man's
record,
and
got
a
photograph
of
him
that
he
had
ample
time
to
have
gotten
a
warrant
provided
he
could
qualify
for
a
warrant.
i
take
the
distinct
position
that
he
did
not
have
sufficient
evidence
to
have
qualified
for
one.
i
take
the
position
that
there
was
no
informant
in
this
case
and
that
what
the
officer
did
was
as
was
suggested
by
one
of
the
justices
in
his
question,
he
had
a
hunch
or
he
possibly
saw
william
beck
in
this
area
and
he
arrested
him.
and
for
all
that
appears
in
the
record
and
for
all
that
we
were
permitted
to
show,
it
could
very
well
have
occurred
that
he
dreamed
this
informer
up
in
an
attempt
to
justify
his
act
of
having
arrested
him.
at
least
this
much
is
true.
we
can
never
disprove
that
he
had
the
information
that
he
says
he
had
and
unless
we
know
who
the
informer
is.
and
i
think
and
we
established
a
dangerous
precedent
if
we
say
that
an
officer
can
establish
beyond
controversy,
conclusively
if
you
please,
the
idea
that
an
informant
told
him
something
and
that
we
will
be
limited
to
whether
or
not
the
judge
in
fact
wants
to
believe
the
officer.
i
think
that
this
is
a
dangerous
precedent
because
in
this
way
we
have
absolutely
no
protection.
and
i
can
call
to
mind
a
situation
in
which
i
participated
in
which
this
very
act
occurred
and
i
cited
only
for
purposes
of
illustrating
the
dangerousness
of
this
precedent.
that
was
a
heinous
murder
in
the
city
of
cleveland
and
the
police
were
interested
in
searching
a
particular
man's
home
because
they
had
some
information
from
the
wife
that
that's
where
he
said
he
was
going.
members
of
the
cleveland
police
department
under
the
leadership
of
lieutenant
delajo,
now
lieutenant,
then
sergeant,
who
is
--
he
was
the
lieutenant
at
that
time,
he
was
the
sergeant
at
the
time
of
this
case
and
he
was
also
the
arresting
officer
in
beck.
this
officer
and
members
under
his
squad
made
an
affidavit
to
the
effect
that
they
had
reliable
information
from
a
confidential
informer
that
the
gun
used
to
kill
that
man
was
secreted
on
a
particular
--
at
his
particular
address
in
the
city
of
cleveland.
they
went
to
a
common
police
judge
which
is
the
higher
court
in
the
city
of
cleveland,
he
refused
to
give
them
a
warrant.
not
being
satisfied
they
went
to
a
lower
judge
in
the
cleveland
municipal
court
judge,
and
with
that
affidavit
got
a
warrant
to
search
this
man's
home.
they
went
out
and
search
his
home
and
found
to
his
file
cabinet
and
all
of
his
records
and
turn
him
over
to
the
internal
revenue
after
they
didn't
find
what
they
were
supposedly
looking
for,
and
here
was
a
clear
cut
example
of
perjury.
officers
swearing
that
they
had
confidential
information
from
confidential
informers
--
a
confidential
informant
that
a
gun
was
secreted
in
a
man's
home
that
which
gun
was
supposed
to
kill
the
third
man.
and
i
think
that
that
type
of
phantom
informant
and
that's
exactly
what
it
is,
is
possible
under
the
beck
situation
because
when
we
tried
the
motion
to
suppress
in
that
case
the
judge
said
based
on
beck
you're
not
entitled
to
know
who
the
informer
is
and
i
think
it's
unfortunate
although
the
evidence
was
considered
suppressible
on
other
grounds
but
possibly
as
an
effort
to
abort
any
appellate
procedure
on
the
point
but
the
idea
that
an
officer
had
the
audacity
to
make
a
statement
based
on
an
opinion
that
stands
as
precedent
in
the
state
of
ohio
that
he
had
confidential
information
with
the
full
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
we
could
never
inquire
as
to
even
the
existence
of
the
informer
i
think
is
a
dangerous
precedent.
thank
you.
