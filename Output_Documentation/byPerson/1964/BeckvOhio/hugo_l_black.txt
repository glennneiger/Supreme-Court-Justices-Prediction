justice

would
--
would
you
--
have
a
trial
of
that
issue
in
which
the
reliability
of
the
informant
could
be
attacked?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
would
you
--
would
you
let
them
try
it
and
put
on
attack
to
which
this
shows
that
he
had
a
bad
character
and
a
bad
reputation,
the
informant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
not,
why
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
-
they're
under
a
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
a
case
of
this
kind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
of
course
they
don't
--
they
don't
rely
on
that
kind
of
evidence
when
they
go
to
convicting,
it's
this
whether
he's
guilty.
they've
got
to
have
direct
evidence
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
mcknight
you
haven't
discussed
one
phase
of
the
page,
why
was
he
searched
at
the
police
station?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
what
was
he
searching
for
when
he
went
to
the
police
station?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
--
you
didn't
discuss
our
case
last
year
of
preston,
did
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
read
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
case
where
we
had
to
pass
on,
we
assumed
that
the
search
and
the
arrest
was
valid,
probable
cause
by
the
court,
car
was
taken
and
the
man
was
arrested
and
after
they
got
him
up
to
the
police
station,
they
went
out
and
broke
into
the
car
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
we
held
that
that
was
not
a
search
incidental
to
the
arrest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
probably
you
can
distinguish
but
it
has
a
pretty
close
relationship
to
this
one
and
i
don't
see
why
you've
mentioned
it
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
did
they
find
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
reason
for
arresting
him
except
the
fact
that
they're
intercepting
him
there?
except
to
find
the
evidence
did
you
--
was
it
part
of
the
routine
procedure
and
arrest
bring
the
man
to
jail?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
see
nothing
about
it
in
the
record.
