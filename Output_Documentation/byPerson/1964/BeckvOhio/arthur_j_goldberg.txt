justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
in
aguilar
i
would
say
that
in
preston
he
did
not
have
to
disclose
the
identity
of
the
informant
and
what
we
said
the
vice
there
was,
there
was
none
of
the
underlying
circumstances
to
both
of
the
affidavits.
and
here
we
have
some
circumstances
then
the
real
question
here
whether
the
circumstance
is
closed.
i
mean
there
are
circumstances
disclosed
that
the
court
or
before
the
court
issued
a
warrant
along
with
their
decisions
that
they
are
then
supporting
an
arrest.
in
those
circumstances
in
which
the
court
feel
are
informant
and
has
very
limited
information
that
this
gentleman
is
in
a
certain
location
as
it
was
derived
in
the
record,
in
a
certain
location
operating
numbers.
and
then
it
appears
that
the
police
checks
and
then
finds
that
he's
been
convicted
three
times
for
this.
and
they
close
up
with
him
that
they
go
out
in
the
area
and
here
you
know
they
run
across
the
man,
locate
him
and
they
search
the
prerogative
the
reliability
of
the
informer's
disclosure.
i
don't
care
who
the
specific
one
is.
have
you
had
the
choice
ahead?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
that
the
question
(voice
overlap).
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
why
--
why
is
that,
distinguished
to
the
preston
very
much
and
that
preston's
argument
