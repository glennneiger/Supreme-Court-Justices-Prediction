justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
officer
testify
that
the
informer
also
said
or
also
suggested
where
the
defendant
would
engage
in
the
sense
that
he
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
willis,
it
maybe
that
they
knew
a
lot
more
when
they
went
out
to
that
location
and
they
knew
at
the
police
station.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
may
have
not
been
able
to
--
may
not
have
had
reasonable
cause
and
they
left
the
station,
but
may
have
had
reasonable
cause
when
they
got
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
but
the
ohio
supreme
court
said
information
was
given
to
the
police
by
an
informer
that
the
defendant
would
be
on
a
certain
locality
at
certain
time
pursuing
his
unlawful
activities.
he
was
found
in
that
locality
as
predicted.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
is
what
the
informer
--
you
don't
question
at
what
the
informer
did
tell
him
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
that's
the
finding,
that's
--
that's
the
factual
matter,
the
ohio
supreme
court
seems
to
resolve
against
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
now
where
does
that
appear,
i
don't
know
where
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
assume
the
point
of
making
all
these
information
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
beck
was
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
of
--
the
officer
said
that
they
had
in
mind
coming
from
the
familiarity
of
the
[inaudible]
in
beulah.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
he
say
that
where
he
got
that
idea
that
be
there
only
asked
to
see
if
[inaudible]
informer
told
him
on
his
behalf.
wasn't
the
defendant
--
and
having
that
to
say
directly,
the
informer
said
to
go
115th
beulah
at
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
where?
[inaudible]
that's
what
i'm
looking
for
in
the
record
that
i
could
not
find
in
this
case
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
mcknight
it
may
not
have
been
searching
here
that
he
had
information
in
the
past,
but
if
you
read
this
record
and
the
testimony
and
saying
that
the
informer
called
the
officer,
not
only
that
then
he
was
engaged
in
this
business
but
if
he
could
be
found
doing
so
at
a
certain
spot
at
a
certain
time,
if
you
read
the
record
that
way
like
the
ohio
supreme
court
did,
you
did
have
some
kind
of
confirmation
for
this
information
until
the
fellow
found
him
in
that
car,
which
is
another
way
of
[inaudible]
of
verifying
to
the
reliability
of
informant.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
real
question
is
whether
or
not
of
course
the
question
is
whether
or
not
that
whether
you
have
what
the
ohio
supreme
court
did
--
