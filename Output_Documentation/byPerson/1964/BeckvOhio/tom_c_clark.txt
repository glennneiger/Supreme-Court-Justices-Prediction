justice
tom
c.
clark
was
that
norman
draper.
justice
tom
c.
clark
or
if
he's
new
--
his
name
he's
then
have
convicted
three
times,
they
had
fixed
it
to
him.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
they
used
that
phrase
in
every
line
of
these
applications
for
warrants
and
they
don't
go
behind
them?
justice
tom
c.
clark
mr.
mcknight.
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
this
pertinent
question
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
that
the
investigation
stating
that
[inaudible]
to
the
precedent
and
disclose
an
--
state
an
element
of
the
record.
i
mean
he
says
if
he
doesn't
have
a
search
warrant
[inaudible]
and
the
question,
“did
you
have
an
opportunity
to
[inaudible]
“i
have
no
opportunity
because
there
was
no
warrant
available
on
subsequent
of
cases.”
how
does
that
came
out
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
the
warrant
[inaudible]
self
evidence?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
an
arrest
warrant
would
not?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
he
could
gone
out
and
considerably
the
arrest
of
the
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
mr.
mcknight
i
thought
perhaps
the
moot
question
is
that
this
[inaudible]
by
he
magistrate.
as
you
said
earlier
the
basis
of
what
the
policeman
had
he'd
be
found,
mr,
beck
at
that
location,
at
that
time,
he
could
not
get
a
warrant.
but
the
precedent
should
use
the
crime
at
that
occasion
at
the
time
he
investigates.
it
was
a
judicial
purpose
then
that
would
have
provide
a
car
[inaudible]
that
closes,
he
didn't
have
time
to
go
back
and
get
a
warrant.
is
that
the
--
is
that
what
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
[inaudible]
is
that
correct?
justice
tom
c.
clark
under
the
arguments
is
full
on
the
basis
on
the
premise
and
whether
the
[inaudible]
and
he
stopped
him
and
they
did
infer
and
[inaudible]
that
the
police
officer
on
a
lot
of
tips
to
see
[inaudible]
being
stopped
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
now
--
now
what
precisely,
what
do
we
have
in
this
record
that
shows
that
beck
is
about
to
–
there
is
this
problem
of
those
who
make
an
arrest.
here
is
a
policeman
[inaudible]
offense
two
years
prior
to
that
time
and
it
hasn't
been
in
fact
--
can
you
justify
that
the
police
had
the
right
to
pick
up
the
man
on
the
street
on
that
basis
of
making
arrest
without
a
warrant,
what
in
addition
did
that
that
we
have
in
this
court,
now
is
that
this
case
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
are
you
arguing
--
are
you
arguing
mr.
mcknight
that
on
the
basis
of
a
tip
without
any
underlying
circumstances
to
show
that
the
informant
so
you
don't
have
to
[inaudible]
based
on
these
tips
that
a
one
time
criminal
is
back
in
business
that
the
police
may
pick
him
up
without
a
warrant.
justice
tom
c.
clark
now
what
--
what
was
he
--
what
does
this
record
show?
if
he
had
made
a
stop
[inaudible]
information
what
does
this
record
show
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
driving
–
justice
tom
c.
clark
do
you
have
a
sufficient
basis
that
they
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
why?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
mean
what
the
search
disclosed
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
that's
irrelevant.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well
here
you
can
search
him
because
you're
at
a
public
place
and
a
public
street
and
you'd
had
to
take
his
clothes
off,
would
you
not?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well
not
to
make
him
remove
every
garment
when
they
put
the
man
in
custody.
justice
tom
c.
clark
that's
what
they
were
doing
weren't
it,
take
him
to
jail.
was
he
in
the
jail?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
this
search
was
in
the
jail.
