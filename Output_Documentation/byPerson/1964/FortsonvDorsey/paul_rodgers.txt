mr.
paul
rodgers
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
paul
rodgers
may
it
please
the
court.
now
this
question
right
here,
this
case
concerns
a
question
involving
a
small
provision
of
the
georgia
senatorial
reapportionment
act.
the
provision
provides
that
each
senator
must
be
a
resident
of
his
own
senatorial
district
and
shall
be
elected
by
the
voters
of
his
own
district,
except
that
the
senators
from
those
senatorial
districts
consisting
of
less
than
one
county
shall
be
elected
by
all
the
voters
of
the
county
in
which
such
senatorial
district
is
located.
so
the
effect
of
that
is,
is
that
the
senatorial
reapportionment
act
divided
georgia
into
54
senatorial
districts.
that
meant
and
this
division
was
done
according
to
population,
that
meant
that
seven
of
georgiaâ€™s
most
populous
counties
were
awarded
21
senators
and
the
districts
within
those
counties
were
carved
out
according
to
populations.
however,
under
this
provision
here,
with
the
exception
of
this
provision
which
the
district
court
invalidated,
those
21
senators
had
to
run
county
at
large.
they
had
to
be
residents
of
their
districts
within
the
county,
but
they
had
to
run
county
at
large.
now
the
plaintiffs
sued
to
require
these
senators
to
run
only
within
their
districts
in
the
seven
most
populous
counties.
the
district
court
determined
in
effect
that
the
combination
of
multi
member
and
single
member
districts
in
the
same
legislative
house
was
per
se
unconstitutional.
now
this
decision
came
down
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
reynolds
versus
sims
and
then
in
the
lucas
case,
which
was
the
colorado
apportionment
case.
as
the
court
well
knows
there's
language
in
there
which
indicates
that
the
combination
of
multi
and
single
member
districts
is
not
per
se
unconstitutional,
but
that
is
all
the
record
contained
in
the
lower
court
is
just
the
fact
this
method
of
election
and
that
was
the
finding
of
the
district
court.
now
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
the
reason
for
it
is,
it
is
historically
in
georgia.
in
fact,
i
don't
know
if
any
exception
of
this
rule,
but
georgia
has
always
had
its
legislative
members
represent
at
least
a
county,
an
area
at
least
as
large
as
a
county.
in
other
words,
georgia
has
always
pursued
the
county
unitary
approach.
now
we
don't
mean
by
that,
we're
not
trying
to
say
that
a
county
is
analogous
to
a
state
or
anything
like
that.
all
we
say
is,
is
that
county
government
itself
just
by
virtue
of
its
mere
operation
over
a
period
of
years
works
a
certain
solidarity
into
the
county
constituency,
which
georgia
believes,
and
many
other
states
believe
too
apparently,
is
worthy
of
reflection
in
the
general
assembly.
now
back
before
baker
versus
carr,
one
of
the
old
systems
of
apportionment,
the
house
of
representatives
was
--
there
were
various
representatives
assigned
to
each
county.
the
more
populous
county
had
three,
the
less
populous
two
or
more.
well,
of
course
that
wouldn't
stand
up
according
to
the
voting
point
of
population.
the
georgia
senate,
the
old
georgia
senate,
each
district
was
composed
of
three
counties,
with
the
exception
of
fulton.
so
it's
been
traditionally,
historically
in
georgia
to
rely
upon
the
county
as
a
basic
unit
of
representation.
mr.
paul
rodgers
that's
right.
now
the
purpose
in
your
seven
most
populous
counties
of
having
districting
is
to
ensure
a
disperse
of
senators
throughout
the
county.
if
you
didn't
district
those
more
populous
counties,
then
conceivably
all
the
senators
could
come
from
one
part
of
the
county.
and
so,
the
district
didn't
require
each
one
to
be
a
resident
of
each
district,
to
ensure
they
disperse,
but
nevertheless
they
run
county
at
large.
mr.
paul
rodgers
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
rodgers
that's
correct.
yes,
exactly.
mr.
paul
rodgers
that's
correct.
yes
sir.
mr.
paul
rodgers
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
rodgers
that's
right.
yes
sir.
now
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
yes
sir,
it's
a
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
they
are
elected
county
at
large.
now
of
course,
that
the
georgia
house
is
before
this
court,
just
on
the
last
month
in
the
case
of
toombs
versus
fortson
and
of
course
that,
the
georgia
house
is
now
under
a
court
order
to
reapportion.
now
under
the
present
system,
you
have
this
three,
two,
one,
your
more
populous
counties
have
three
representatives
and
they
run
county
at
large,
but
they
don't
run
from
districts.
they
could
all
come
from
the
same
part
of
the
county.
and
then
your
lesser
populous
counties
have
two
each
and
then
the
still
lesser
populous
have
one
each,
but
you
don't
have
representative
districts;
they
run
county
at
large.
mr.
paul
rodgers
yes,
i
think
there's
an
excellent
chance
of
that.
now
we
pushed
before
the
district
court
the
very
definitive
thing
about
whether
you
shouldn't
or
you
have
got
obvious
legislative
remedy,
but
of
course
that's
the
colorado
case
that's
decided
for
this
court
and
of
course
we've
dropped
that,
because
of
course
that
showed
there
was
no
more
water
in
that
theory.
however,
i
think
of
course
there's
a
chance
for
having
a
legislative
solution
is
very
good.
in
fact,
the
plaintiff
or
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
mcintyre
is
a
state
senator
and
i
think
it
would
be
an
excellent
chance.
that's
one
of
the
things
we
said
was,
why
go
to
court?
why
don't
you
pursue
your
legislative
remedy?
mr.
paul
rodgers
no
sir,
none
has
been
introduced
and
that's
also
in
the
record.
we
had
two
affidavits
in
there
showing
that
no
bill
has
ever
been
introduced
in
either
house
to
do
it.
so
there's
been
no
effort
made
and
therefore
no
failure
in
here.
now
on
this
part
about
the
--
about
the
election
county
at
large,
we
do
not
feel
that
there's
any
mathematical
evaluation
in
the
vote,
because
while
a
person
who
say
residing
in
fulton
county
has
the
right
to
vote
for
seven
senators
and
he
has
seven
people
representing
him
en
banc,
his
influence
theoretically
upon
any
single
senator
is
seven
times
less
than
anyone
in
the
rural
or
one
of
your
lesser
populated
districts
where
everyone
is
represented
by
a
single
senator.
and
to
appeal
that
mathematically
it
balances
out,
of
course
the
advantage
of
being
represented
by
a
single
senator
is
that
you
are
part
of
a
smaller
constituency.
and
the
advantage
of
being
represented
by
seven
senators
is
or
the
disadvantage
of
being
represented
by
seven
senators
is
that
you
are
a
part
of
a
larger
constituency,
but
this
balances
out
mathematically.
and
of
course,
that's
the
whole
question,
so
there's
no
question
in
this
case
about
the
54
additions
now
being
apportioned
according
to
population.
now
the
second
thing
is,
is
actually
we
think
from
a
mathematical
point
of
view,
it
works
even
this
practice
of
georgia's
election
standard
even
less
discriminatory,
permit
within
permissible
standards
that
will
have
then
having
54
single
member
districts.
for
instance
in
fulton,
county
to
give
you
an
example,
we
have
seven
senatorial
districts,
which
we
say
are
substantially
equal,
but
of
course
you
can't
get
them
exactly
equal,
so
contemplating
the
district.
you
have
the
district
that
has
the
most
population
that
is
a
little
under
representative
and
the
district
that
has
the
least
population
is
a
little
bit
over
represented
and
of
course
you
have
the
varying
degrees
in
between,
understand
we
can
get
all
this
as
permissible.
but
if
you
elect
them
by
districts
in
fulton
county,
so
that
means
the
voters
in
some
districts
have
a
little
smaller,
but
permissible
edge
over
those
and
others.
however
when
you
elect
them
county
at
large
then
every
voter
in
fulton
county
has
an
exactly
equal
vote.
so
that
led
to
discrimination
although
permissible
is
completely
taken
out.
now
this
case
subdivides
into
two
parts.
the
first
part
is
the
combination
of
single
and
multi
member
districts
within
the
same
house.
and
the
other
part
is,
is
the
election
with
any
county
electing
them
county-wide.
now
as
to
the
first
part,
the
record
is
very
clear
that
the
practice
of
combining
single
and
multi
member
districts
in
one
house
has
been
done
throughout
the
united
states
for
a
long
period
of
time.
also,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
this
court's
decision
in
reynolds
versus
sims
and
in
the
colorado
apportionment
case
has
especially
approved
that
practice.
and
even
when
the
court
--
even
when
this
court
in
the
colorado
case
was
explaining
why
possibly
the
colorado
referendum,
which
favored
something
other
than
population.
the
reason
that
failed
was
because
that
the
people
may
not
want
to
vote
in
a
system
whereby
the
more
populous
counties
in
colorado
would
have
to
elect
a
large
number
of
legislators.
the
court
was
nevertheless
careful
to
point
out
that
we
are
not
intimate
that
apportionment
schemes
which
provide
for
the
at
large
election
of
a
number
of
legislators
from
a
county
or
any
political
subdivision
are
constitutionally
defective.
rather,
they
would
merely
point
out
that
there
are
certain
aspects
for
electing
legislators
at
large
from
a
county
as
a
whole
that
might
well
make
the
adoption
of
such
a
scheme
unresolved
with
many
voters
residing
in
multi
member
counties.
also,
this
court
in
those
cases
has
approved
the
practice
of
using
political
subdivision
lines
in
drawing
legislative
districts.
also,
this
court
as
recently
as
the
17th
of
last
month
based
on
the
decision
in
scranton
versus
drew,
the
three-judge
court
decision
and
you
know,
the
state
of
pennsylvania
has
somewhat
of
a
similar
apportion
of
this,
although
it's
not
as
consistent
as
the
georgia
plan.
now
in
the
pennsylvania
case,
pennsylvania
is
saying,
this
is
only
the
house
of
representatives,
the
same
that
the
senate
only
has
single
member
districts,
but
in
pennsylvania,
they
have
taken
a
county
and
they
have
divided
with
the
most
populous
county
within
30
districts
and
within
that
county,
some
districts
had
two
members
and
some
of
them
more.
now
in
scranton
versus
drew
found
that
per
se
unconstitutional,
but
of
course,
you
have
constituency
you
have
there
in
georgia.
well
in
the
mean
time,
after
that
stage
was
made
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
butcher
versus
bloom
also
determined
that
the
pennsylvania
legislature
did
not
measure
up
the
constitutional
standards,
because
of
population
disparities.
but
in
that
butcher
versus
bloom,
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
found
out
the
combination
of
single
and
multi
member
districts
was
not
per
se
unconstitutional.
and
that
--
and
that
you
could
well
have
it
together
if
done
properly
on
a
rational
basis
without
population
disparities.
now,
because
of
the
willingness,
the
willingness
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
to
assume
the
chore
of
bringing
the
pennsylvania
legislature
up
to
constitutional
standards,
this
court
based
here
in
scranton
versus
drew
and
gave
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
the
green
light
to
rectify
the
situation
in
pennsylvania.
now
as
to
the
election
as
the
second
difference
about
the
election
at
large
within
the
county,
as
the
court
well
knows
that
we
signed
our
brief
here,
many
municipalities
in
the
united
states
elect
their
councilmen
or
their
alderman
at
large
and
at
the
same
time
require
these
councilmen
and
aldermen
come
from
various
parts
of
the
city.
the
city
that
having
been
divided
into
wards,
a
city
that
we
cite
particularly
is
the
city
of
atlanta
and
the
city
of
atlanta
has
enjoyed
as
this
court
well
knows
a
moderate
and
racial
relationship
also
the
city
of
course
is
very
progressive.
and
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
city,
we
believe
has
done
so
well
is
because
the
alderman
of
the
city
has
had
to
run
city-wide
and
they
have
had
a
city-wide
approach
to
problems
and
if
we
think
that
if
that
works
well
in
the
city
of
atlanta,
it
works
well
in
other
cities
of
the
united
states.
if
there
are
no
debates
in
voting
strength
that
we
see
no
reason
why
it
should
not
work
the
same
way
in
electing
the
fulton
county
delegation.
now
these
cases,
this
case
here
involves
the
interpretation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
now
the
equal
protection
clause
has
been
historically
and
traditionally
interpreted
to
this
court
as
having
a
wide
latitude
for
state
action
and
of
course,
i
won't
go
into
detail
of
the
cases,
but
of
course
this
court
is
familiar
with
norvell
versus
illinois,
which
is
the
case
filed
in
griffin
versus
illinois.
in
norvell,
the
plaintiff
complained
that
he
should
be
released,
because
he
cannot
have
a
case
reheard,
because
the
court
reporter
died
and
there
was
no
transcript
available.
and
so
the
--
this
court
determined
in
an
opinion
by
justice
douglas
i
believe
that
they
--
that
the
--
that
the
rough
accommodation,
accommodations
made
by
the
government
did
not
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
unless
the
lines
drawn
are
hostile
and
invidious.
that
was
a
1963
decision
which
very
recently
has
shown
to
play
the
latitude
that
a
state
has
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
the
court
--
the
court
is
also
familiar
with
the
case
in
mcgowan
versus
maryland
wherein
it
stated
a
statutory
discrimination
will
not
be
set
aside
if
any
state
of
facts
reason
that
maybe
conceived
to
justify.
now
on
this
county
at
large
election,
we
believe
that
because
of
the
fact
that
there
is
at
the
counter
effect
that
reflects
a
fairly
solid
unit
of
political
thinking
that
it
is
a
rational
approach
to
require
a
representative
elected
county
at
large.
now
in
the
brief,
the
appellees
also
comment
upon
this
matter
of
submerging
certain
elements
within
the
constituency.
they
say
that
in
georgia,
a
senatorial
district
the
average
is
about
73,000
population.
they
say
to
require
the
at
large
election
of
these
more
populous
counties
is
--
submerges
certain
groups
to
certain
interest
within
the
more
populous
counties,
that
these
groups
are
identifiable
so
they
say
and
that
they
should
have
their
own
personal
representative
in
the
general
assembly.
so
this
thing
about
submerging
various
interests
of
minor
political
parties
and
so
forth,
that
submerge
it
can
occur
just
as
easily
in
single-member
districts
as
it
can
in
your
plural-member
districts.
for
instance,
in
california,
california
has
a
senate
composed
of
40
members
and
the
average
population
for
a
senate
member
is
392,000,
almost
393,000.
now
obviously,
as
california
--
i
don't
know
what
the
situation
is
out
there
apportionment
wise,
but
if
california
were
to
divide
the
state
into
40
single-member
senatorial
districts
and
require
one
member
to
come
from
each,
then
no
doubt,
there
would
be
no
complaint.
but
obviously,
within
that
393,000
there
have
been
many
minor
parties,
many
view
points
and
so
forth
merged.
we
do
not
believe
that,
that
approach
is
significant,
because
we
believe
the
two
criterion
which
this
court
has
thus
far
required
is
first,
that
it
should
be
a
rational
basis,
because
this
cannot
be
some
crazy
â€“
affair
with
no
rationality.
the
lines
cannot
be
drawn
hostile
and
invidiously,
such
as
they
were
drawn
in
the
gomillion
case
whereby
the
city
of
tuskegee
city
limits
were
redone
i
think
in
a
28
sided
figure
to
exclude
the
negro
population
here
and
there.
that
it
must
be
--
the
first
is
it
must
be
rational,
we
believe
it
says.
secondly
is,
that
it
he
must
not
debase
the
value
of
any
vote
and
we
believe
that
we
have
shown
that
the
system
here
does
not
devalue
any
vote,
that
the
control
of
the
georgia
senate
is
in
the
hands
of
the
majority
of
the
people
of
georgia,
if
they
are
dissatisfied
with
this
system,
they
can
change
it
anytime.
now
we
believe
here
that
what
this
case
presents
is
nothing
more
than
a
political
debate,
which
addresses
itself
to
general
assembly
of
georgia
and
not
to
the
court,
thank
you.
mr.
paul
rodgers
i
have
no
further
arguments,
mr.
chief
justice.
