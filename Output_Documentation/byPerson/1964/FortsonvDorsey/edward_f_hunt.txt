mr.
edward
f.
hunt
mr
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
if
it
pleases
the
court,
the
appellees
in
this
case
feel
that
they
can
state
their
basic
premise
quite
succinctly.
we
say
merely
that
if
a
ballot
cast
by
a
citizen
of
the
state
of
georgia
for
his
choice
as
his
state
senator
is
not
equally
weighted
and
is
not
as
directly
influential
toward
the
election
of
the
candidate
of
his
choice
as
a
ballot,
which
is
cast
by
another
citizen
of
the
state
of
georgia,
then
the
former
citizen
has
been
discriminated
against
and
a
preference
has
been
given
to
the
latter
citizen.
mr.
edward
f.
hunt
mr
justice
goldberg,
i
think
our
argument
would
be
the
same,
because
then
we
will
come
to
a
sub
issue,
which
is
the
submerging
of
minority
racial
or
minority
political
parties,
which
we
feel
is
a
subsidiary
issue
in
this
case.
we
don't
feel
that
it's
a
main
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
f.
hunt
no
sir.
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
it
goes
that
far.
i
think
it
is
subsidiary
to
the
main
point,
which
we
have
in
our
case
and
it
is
a
valid
subsidiary
reason.
it
is
not
of
paramount
importance,
but
it
is
a
valid
underlying
reason
and
i
am
not
sure
that
this
court
should
or
would
go
as
far
as
to
say
that
this
is
a
constitutionally
protected
right
at
this
time,
but
we
feel
that
we
should
mention
it
to
the
court
however
briefly,
for
what
persuasiveness
it
may
have,
if
that
answers
your
question,
sir.
if
it
pleases
the
court,
the
situation
i
have
described
that
one
citizen's
vote
would
be
weighted
greater
than
another
citizen's
vote
and
one
citizen's
vote
wouldn't
be
as
directly
influential
and
toward
the
election
of
the
candidate
of
his
choice
would
obtain
today
in
georgia
where
if
not
for
the
fact
that
we
filed
this
suit
attacking
section
9
of
the
senatorial
reapportionment
act
of
1962.
we
maintain
that
the
decision
rendered
by
the
united
states
district
court
below
was
correct
and
we
of
course
urge
here
that
that
decision
be
affirmed.
now
in
our
brief
at
page
number
5,
we
alluded
to
what
i
would
like
to
term
the
negative
approach
to
the
invidious
discrimination
we
claim.
by
the
negative
approach,
i
mean
that
we
showed
in
our
brief
how
few
voters
from
foreign
districts
within
the
same
county
could
combine
to
defeat
the
popular
choice
of
the
voters
within
a
given
senatorial
district,
which
itself
was
within
a
multi
district
county.
very
briefly,
senatorial
district
number
34
and
fulton
county
georgia
is
one
of
seven
senatorial
districts
in
that
county.
there
are
82,195
people
in
that
district.
if
every
one
of
them
in
their
absurd,
i
think
the
absurd
circumstance,
which
we
describe
that
every
single
one
of
them
voted
for
the
same
candidate
to
represent
that
district
as
a
state
senator,
then
the
votes
of
only
18%
of
the
other
district,
so
the
voters
in
the
other
districts
within
fulton
county
could
nullify
of
that
unbelievably
unanimous
choice.
now
the
mathematics
are
quite
simple,
there
are
approximately
475,000
people
in
the
other
six
districts
in
fulton
county,
georgia.
18%
of
475,000,
if
my
mathematics
is
correct
is
approximately
85,500,
which
means
that
even
if
they
all
voted
for
the
same
man
and
he
was
unbelievably
popular,
he
could
be
nullified
by
only
18%
of
the
other
people
in
the
county.
now
this
is
in
the
brief
and
i
will
take
no
more
time
with
it.
i
would
like
to
show
to
this
court
in
oral
argument
today
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
i
would
like
to
show
the
court
what
it
takes,
what
large
number
of
people
it
would
take
to
affirm
the
popular
choice
of
these
people
in
a
given
senatorial
district
within
a
multi
district
county.
and
for
the
purposes
of
this
illustration,
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
map
which
is
at
page
25
of
the
record
i
believe.
i
would
like,
if
it
pleases
the
court
to
contrast
the
treatment
received
by
the
voters
in
senatorial
district
number
12,
which
contains
the
exact
same
geographical
boundaries
as
dougherty
county,
georgia,
with
the
treatment
received
by
the
people
in
senatorial
district
number
40,
which
is
one
of
the
seven
districts
in
fulton
county.
now
these
--
i
have
chosen
these
two
different
senatorial
districts,
number
12
in
south
georgia
and
number
40
in
populous
fulton
county,
because
they
are
virtually
equal
in
population.
in
district
number
12,
there
are
75,680
voters,
in
district
number
40,
there
are
74,834
voters.
now
both
of
these
districts
of
course
are
in
the
same
state.
the
people
in
these
districts
are
entitled
to
the
same
equal
rights.
the
same
state
law
applies
to
both
classes
of
people,
but
we
will
demonstrate
that
they
are
being
given
different
treatment
by
virtue
of
section
9
of
the
act
we
have
attacked.
now
in
senatorial
district
number
12
in
dougherty
county,
if
38,000
people
got
together
and
voted
for
the
representative
of
their
choice,
38,000
people
out
of
approximately
75,000
would
constitute
a
bare
majority
and
that
bare
majority
would
directly
elect
their
senator
and
he
would
become
their
senator
and
be
seated
in
the
general
assembly.
now
in
senatorial
district
number
40
up
in
fulton
county
suppose
38,000
people
chose
the
same
representative
there,
he
would
not
become
their
representative,
because
the
choice
of
the
38,000
people
in
senatorial
district
number
40
in
fulton
county
would
depend
upon
what
the
480,000
other
people
within
fulton
county,
georgia
decided
to
do.
in
other
words,
if
everybody
in
fulton
county
decided
that
they
would
vote
in
this
race
before
the
majority
choice
of
the
people
in
senatorial
district
number
40
was
brought
to
fruition,
240,000
other
people
from
foreign
districts
within
the
same
county
would
have
to
concur
in
the
choice
of
the
majority
of
the
people
in
senatorial
district
number
40.
now
this
means
and
we
ask
the
question
why
should
38,000
people
in
south
georgia,
in
dougherty
county
be
able
to
constitute
a
simple
majority
and
elect
their
senators
when
38,000
people
in
fulton
county
in
north
georgia
have
to
depend
on
the
whim,
caprice,
prejudice,
or
what
have
you
of
almost
250,000
other
voters
before
their
choice
will
be
recognized
and
before
their
choice
will
be
seated
in
the
state
senate.
we
maintain
that
this
difference
in
treatment
is
the
basic
--
mr.
edward
f.
hunt
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
f.
hunt
that
is
a
theoretical
possibility.
mr.
edward
f.
hunt
i
say
it
is
–
pardon
me,
maybe
i
did
not
understand
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
edward
f.
hunt
no
sir,
it
is
not
--
it
is
not
more
theoretical
than
mine.
and
this
could
happen
is
my
answer
to
your
statement,
it
certainly
could
happen.
now
in
our
motion
to
affirm,
which
we
filed
in
this
court
and
again
in
our
brief,
we
chose
to
quote
the
language
of
mr.
justice
douglas
in
gray
versus
sanders
and
that
language
being
that
once
the
geographical
unit
for
which
a
representative
is
to
be
chosen
has
been
designated,
then
everyone
who
participates
in
that
election
should
have
an
equal
right
of
participation
and
an
equal
vote
regardless
of
their
race,
sex,
or
regardless
of
where
their
home
site
is
where
they
reside
within
the
geographical
unit.
we
emphasize
this
case
on
two
occasions,
because
we
thought
that
the
language
was
significant.
mr.
edward
f.
hunt
mr
justice
stewart,
it
may
be
correct
and
i
would
think
it
would
be
correct,
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
this
is
coupled
with
a
difference
in
treatment
between
the
two
classes
of
senators.
i
think
you
have
got
to
view
--
mr.
edward
f.
hunt
–
the
different
treatment
being
given
to
the
two
classes
of
voters,
excuse
me,
along
with
the
language
which
we've
quoted
from
gray
and
i
feel
that
after
you
have
done
that,
then
the
invidious
discrimination
of
which
we
have
complained
comes
through
and
is
recognizable.
i
would
say
that
if
that
language,
which
we
have
quoted
from
gray
versus
sanders
is
not
wholly
dispositive
of
the
issue
and
we
feel
that
it
is
dispositive
of
the
issue
and
should
dispose
it
in
our
favorite.
if
it
is
not
wholly
dispositive
of
the
issue
then
it
certainly
must
be
given
great
weight
toward
the
decision
in
this
case,
because
it
certainly
is
not
inappropriate.
i
think
it
certainly
has
to
apply
to
our
case.
we
feel
that,
if
it
pleases
the
court
that
in
this
court's
recent
decisions
in
gray
and
in
wesberry
and
in
reynolds,
that
this
court
has
dedicated
itself
to
the
proposition
of
one
man,
one
vote.
now
our
court
in
georgia,
the
federal
district
court
in
toombs
versus
fortson
and
again
in
norvell
case
expressed
this
concept
a
little
bit
differently.
they
said
that
the
essence
of
representation
and
we
have
quoted
it
at
page
5
of
our
brief,
i
believe,
the
essence
of
representative
government
is
that
choosing
of
the
representative
by
those
he
represents.
now
we
feel
that
section
9,
by
allowing
foreign
districts
within
the
multi
district
county
to
nullify
the
choice,
the
majority
choice
of
the
voters
in
a
given
district
denies
this
essence
of
representation.
we
say
that
if
this
court
should
reverse
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
then
there
will
be
a
million
and
a
half
people
in
georgia
who
live
in
the
most
populous
multi
district
counties,
who
will
be
partially
disenfranchised,
because
their
vote
will
not
directly
count
toward
the
election
of
their
state
senator.
i
will
take
just
a
few
more
minutes
to
rebut
some
of
my
brother's
contentions.
the
state
of
georgia,
the
secretary
of
state
has
argued
that
political
autonomy
of
the
counties
has
been
historic
in
georgia
and
this
should
be
given
credence
when
they
draw
up
any
sort
of
reapportioned
legislature.
our
answer
to
that
is,
of
course,
that
counties
historically
have
never
been
known
--
have
never
been
recognized
as
sovereigns.
they
are
mere
agencies
of
the
state.
they
are
a
convenient
method
of
administering
a
sovereign
such
as
the
state
of
georgia,
which
is
tremendous
as
i
believe
it's
the
largest
state
east
of
the
mississippi.
this
is
the
reason
for
the
county.
a
county
standing
by
itself
has
no
sovereignty
and
we
think
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
decisions
of
many
legal
writers
will
bear
this
out.
we
also
would
point
to
the
fact
that
this
court
in
lucas
versus
the
general
assembly
of
colorado
examined
a
situation
where
the
people
of
the
state
of
colorado,
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly,
chose
a
plan,
which
emphasized
and
took
into
account
natural
boundaries,
political
boundaries,
and
the
history
of
the
state
of
colorado.
and
even
though
the
voters
chose
that
plan
over
an
alternative
plan,
which
they
might
have
chosen,
this
court
nonetheless,
on
the
ground
that
one
house
under
the
plan
would
be
malapportioned,
invalidated
that
plan.
therefore,
i
don't
think
that
the
county's
argument
with
regard
to
electoral
homogeneity
or
political
autonomy
of
the
county
is
valid.
the
state
has
also
argued
at
page
18
that
the
fulton
county
voter
is
part
of
an
electorate.
well
this
is
just
the
very
thing
in
his
brief,
which
we
are
trying
to
have
invalidated.
the
fulton
county
voter
or
our
clients
in
this
case,
don't
want
to
be
part
of
an
electorate.
they
want
a
whole
vote
for
a
whole
man.
the
reasons
that
underlie
that
are
that
if
you
elect
county
at
large
as
i
think
this
court
pointed
out
in
lucas,
there
is
no
identifiable
constituency,
the
people
are
not
responsive.
the
representative
is
not
responsible
for
some
identifiable
constituency.
he
is
responsible
at
large,
but
nobody
can
really
put
their
finger
on
him
and
say,
“you
are
my
man
and
you
are
not
representing
me
the
way
i
thought
you
would
represent
me
when
i
cast
my
ballot
for
you.”
and
the
representative
can
very
well
say
or
wouldn't
say
to
the
voter,
but
he
could
smile
to
himself
and
say,
“so
what,
this
man
is
submerged
in
the
entire
county
and
as
long
as
i
can
satisfy
the
entire
county,
i
don't
have
to
worry
about
a
constituency.
i'm
one
of
seven
of
the
large
constituency.”
this
is
our
argument
against
that
--
mr.
edward
f.
hunt
it
might
have
been.
mr.
edward
f.
hunt
i
think
there
was
--
mr.
edward
f.
hunt
yes
there
was
a
case
in
brooklyn
similar
to
that,
was
there
not,
where
you
could
vote
for
two
congressmen
in
the
recent
new
york
case
i
believe
--
mr.
edward
f.
hunt
well,
these
questions
admit
of
varied
attacks.
we
say
this,
that
we
think
that
the
overriding,
the
overriding
disability
of
this
statute,
the
overriding
disability
is
the
difference
in
treatment,
which
is
accorded
to
two
different
classes
of
voters
in
the
state
of
georgia.
this
is
the
thing
that
the
district
court
seized
upon
and
this
is
the
rationale
of
their
decision.
just
for
a
moment
--
mr.
edward
f.
hunt
well
--
mr.
edward
f.
hunt
that's
right.
it
would
be
uniform
treatment
you
wouldn't
be
establishing
two
different
classes.
mr.
edward
f.
hunt
that's
right.
i
hadn't
thought
of
that
feature
of
that
--
mr.
edward
f.
hunt
yes
sir,
but
this
is
not
a
question,
we
concede
that
the
legislature
here
is
not
malapportioned
--
mr.
edward
f.
hunt
so
that
question
is
not
before
us.
that's
another
problem
which
we
don't
fortunately
have
to
reach
in
this
case.
the
only
other
thing
i
would
like
to
say
is
that
mr.
rodgers
has
argued
that
the
court
below
said
that
combinations
of
multi
and
single
member
districts
were
unconstitutional,
i
don't
read
their
decision
that
way
and
i
don't
see
anything
in
their
decision
to
warrant
that.
they
didn't
mention
multi
districts
and
single
districts
as
such
in
their
decision.
if
i
could
call
the
court's
attention
to
page
44,
the
real
decision
of
the
district
court
below
was
that
the
statute
causes
a
clear
difference
in
treatment,
accorded
voters
in
each
of
the
two
classes
of
senatorial
districts.
it
is
the
same
law
applied
differently
to
different
persons.
and
then,
they
went
on
later
to
say
that
they
had
decided
in
great
--
they
had
looked
at
this
problem
in
toombs
and
this
court,
this
honorable
court
had
looked
at
it
in
gray
and
their
reasons
for
deciding
it
was
the
essence
of
representation,
which
is
the
quotation
which
we
used
and
put
in
our
brief.
if
it
pleases
the
court,
i
have
nothing
further.
