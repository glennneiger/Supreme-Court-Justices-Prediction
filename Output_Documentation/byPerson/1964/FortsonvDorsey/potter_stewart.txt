on
the
other
hand,
if
he
gets
the
entire
vote
in
his
own
district
in
justice
brennan's
example,
if
he
gets
all
10,000
votes
in
his
district,
he
would
lose
if
everybody
in
the
other
two
districts
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
any
bill
then
introduced?
justice
potter
stewart
first
mr.
hunt,
the
answer
that
you
get
in
this
case
as
in
so
many
cases
depends
upon
the
question
you
ask
and
it
could
--
this
could
be
looked
upon
as
a
policy
by
georgia
to
have
the
geographical
unit,
the
minimum
geographical
unit,
a
county
you
said,
a
county
and
in
these
larger
counties
to
have
voters
represented
not
by
one,
but
by
seven
representatives
and
to
guarantee
that
those
seven
come
from
different
parts
of
that
county,
but
to
have
the
whole
county
elect
him
and
that
would
be
your
geographical
unit.
so
this
language
quoted
on
page
seven
of
your
brief
here
would
precisely
fit
this
situation
if
you
think
of
this
system
in
those
terms,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
other
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
--
don't
you
--
don't
you
envision
the
possibility
that
if
the
legislature
had
done
it
the
other
way,
that
too
could
be
attacked,
because
on
the
basis
that
the
legislature
had
determined
that
fulton
county
was
entitled
to
seven
representatives
and
therefore,
i
as
a
resident
of
fulton
county,
i'm
entitled
to
vote
for
all
seven
representatives.
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
system
would
allow
me
to
vote
for
only
one
representative.
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
as
a
resident
of
fulton
county.
justice
potter
stewart
my
only
suggestion
is,
that
if
the
court
or
the
legislature
should
decide
this
in
your
favor
then
it
would
be
subject
to
that
kind
of
constitutional
attack.
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
true
of
course
in
any
amount
--
completely
malapportioned
legislature.
you
have
the
same
right
as
everybody
else
in
your
district.
justice
potter
stewart
oh
yes
â€“
