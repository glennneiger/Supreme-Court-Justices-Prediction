mr.
carl
rachlin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
appeal
from
two
convictions
in
number
24
and
one
in
number
49.
however,
we
have
submitted
consolidated
--
a
consolidated
brief
in
those
three
situations.
in
24,
we
appeal
from
a
--
in
affirmance
of
a
conviction
pursuant
to
louisiana
revised
statute
14.100.1
obstructing
the
sidewalks
and
--
for
which
cox
received
a
sentence
of
five
months,
$500
or
an
additional
five
months
in
lieu
thereof.
in
addition,
we
appeal
under
14.103.1
for
breach
of
the
peace
for
which
cox
received
four
months,
$200
or
an
additional
four
months.
both
24
and
49
arise
from
a
single
incident,
a
single
demonstration
which
i
will
attempt
to
describe
in
a
moment,
and
the
same
facts
are
available
to
all
three
convictions.
other
aspects
of
this
very
same
case
have
previously
been
before
this
court.
in
clem
--
excuse
me,
in
clemmons
against
core,
where
this
court
denied
certiorari,
375
u.s.
992,
the
same
factual
basis
was
involved
precisely
except
there
was
another
issue
and
this
court
has
previously
denied
cert
--
but
the
facts
apply
precisely
to
this
case.
mr.
carl
rachlin
no,
that
was
moore
against
louisiana
your
honor,
which
the
facts
there
would
--
took
place
a
short
while
before
the
events
about
--
of
which
i'm
about
to
describe.
however,
clemmons
against
core,
it
is
exactly
the
same
facts,
nothing
different
whatsoever.
we
appealed
and
this
court
noted
probable
cause.
on
december
14th,
1961,
23
youngsters
were
arrested
for
peaceful
picketing
in
downtown
baton
rouge.
the
purpose
of
that
picketing
was
to
protest
against
the
discrimination
of
negroes
and
the
segregation
of
negroes.
on
december
15th,
southern
university
students,
and
southern
university
is
a
few
miles
outside
of
the
city
of
baton
rouge,
began
a
--
to
hold
a
demonstration
and
decided
to
make
a
protest
against
the
arrest
of
these
23
and
to
protest
the
segregation
and
discrimination
that
existed
in
baton
rouge
at
the
time
by
coming
in
to
baton
rouge
to
point
out
their
protest,
and
by
various
means
some
on
foot,
some
by
auto,
some
by
bus.
they
arrived
a
couple
of
blocks
from
the
scene
of
the
incidence
which
we
are
concerned
with
here.
and
approx
--
at
some
point
shortly
or
about
noon
time
of
that
day,
they
were
met
by
the
chief
of
police,
mr.
wingate
white,
and
by
the
sheriff,
mr.
clemmons
of
clemmons
against
core
and
by
the
mayor
and
one
or
two
others.
mr.
cox
at
this
point,
the
appellant
here,
met
these
honored
gentlemen
and
they
discussed
the
event
that
was
about
to
take
place.
and
cox
advised
them
they
were
going
to
have
some
songs,
some
prayers
and
he
would
make
a
short
speech.
he
was
directed
to
hold
his
demonstration
on
the
west
side
of
the
street,
approximately
103
feet
from
the
courthouse
and
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
sidewalk
from
--
adjourned
the
courthouse.
and
this
meeting
then
went
on.
pursuant
to
his
instructions
by
the
chief
of
police
and
the
sheriff
to
meet
on
the
west
side,
that
is
the
side
away
from
the
court.
at
this
very
moment
of
course,
the
2000
people
approximately,
were
visible
to
the
police
and
to
the
sheriff
and
to
the
mayor
and
everybody
knew
it
was
approximately
noon
time.
so
the
question
of
the
time,
the
place
and
the
numbers
were
known
to
everybody
and
in
a
sense
a
contract,
if
you
will
permit
me
to
use
the
word.
mr.
carl
rachlin
yes,
it
was
agreed
it
will
be
a
short
meeting.
mr.
carl
rachlin
some
--
this
--
there
were
some
dispute
in
the
facts
whether
it
was
going
to
last
seven
minutes
or
whether
it
was
going
to
last
about
17
or
19
minutes
but
the
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
we
have
reference
to
it
in
our
brief
your
honor.
mr.
carl
rachlin
there
is
a
--
that
is
a
disputed
fact
but
not
at
all
referred
to
in
the
trial
--
in
the
opinion
of
the
trial
court
one
way
or
the
other.
and
if
you
--
if
i
will
indicate
in
a
moment
that
that
had
aptly
nothing
to
do
with
the
termination
of
the
meeting
whatsoever.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
your
honor
that
it
--
the
state
--
that
is
partly
correct.
the
state's
position
is
that
cox
had
agreed
to
a
seven-minute
meeting.
mr.
carl
rachlin
there
as
we
say,
that
the
facts
in
the
record
do
not
bear
that
out,
that
the
trial
judge
makes
no
reference
to
these
seven
minutes
whatsoever.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you'll
permit
me
sir,
when
cox
made
his
speech
and
taking
the
liberty
of
a
minister
and
i
don't
doubt
he
spoke
perhaps
a
little
longer
and
we
lawyers
perhaps
shouldn't
complain
about
the
use
of
speech
by
a
minister.
but
nevertheless,
cox
spoke
and
there
was
no
problem.
and
i
now
read
from
page
354
of
the
record
before
us,
when
cox
said,
and
then
he
came
to
a
point,
“it's
now
noon
time,
you
must
be
hungry,
why
don't
you
go
sit
down
and
demand
to
be
fed”,
referring
to
the
restaurants
in
downtown
baton
rouge.
it
must
be
kept
in
mind
your
honor
that
four
days
before,
garner
was
decided
by
this
court.
and
garner
was
a
baton
rouge
case.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
some
of
the
very
attorneys
who
appeared
in
garner
appear
in
the
very
case
before
us.
now
at
that
point,
and
i
now
quote
precisely
from
the
sheriff's
testimony,
i'd
--
i
have
a
few
and
you
recall
there
was
--
at
the
moment
cox
said,
“let's
go
have
lunch”,
the
sheriff
clemmons
says,
“i
grabbed
a
power
microphone.
i
didn't
grab
--
sergeant
ryprech
was
standing
by
and
i
took
this
power
microphone
and
i
said,
"now,
you
have
been
allowed
to
demonstrate.
up
until
now,
your
demonstration
has
been
more
or
less
peaceful,
but
what
you
are
doing
now
is
a
direct
violation
of
the
law.
a
disturbance
of
the
peace
and
has
--
it
has
got
to
be
broken
up
immediately.”
it
was
--
and
this
testimony
is
confirmed
by
chief
justice
white
--
excuse
me
sir,
by
the
police
chief
white
who,
it
says
precisely
the
same
thing
on
this
point.
there
is
--
in
other
words,
there
is
actually
no
doubt
that
the
moment
the
meeting
was
broken
up
was
the
moment
that
cox
said,
“let's
have
lunch”
referring
to
presumably
attempt
to
be
fed
at
the
various
restaurants
in
downtown
baton
rouge.
at
this
point,
the
sheriff
comes
forward,
he
makes
a
statement.
we
have
another
conflict
of
testimony
in
which
it
is
claimed
that
cox
has
said,
“don't
move”
after
the
sheriff
has
said
“break
up
the
meeting”.
i
might
add
parenthetically,
when
the
sheriff
said,
“move
on”
it
is
hard
to
understand,
and
i
don't
mean
to
criticize
from
this
point
of
view,
but
nevertheless
looking
back
at
it
when
you
have
2000
people
packed
on
a
sidewalk,
ten
feet
wide,
by
approximately
200
feet
long
and
you
say,
“move
on”
with
a
crowd
of
perhaps
--
people
interested
--
spectators
across
the
street,
they're
little
difficult
to
understand
what
move
on
means.
and
move
on
might
have
created
more
chaos
than
if
the
sheriff
had
said,
for
example,
“move
on
to
the
south,
move
on
to
the
north,
everybody
out
of
the
square.”
he
says,
“move
on”
and
never
says
which
direction
to
go.
and
we
could've
had
real
chaos
if
the
order
in
fact
was
obeyed.
well,
whether
cox
or
did
or
did
not
say,
“don't
move”,
three
witnesses
heard
him
say
some
variation
of
that
and
five
witnesses
heard
him
say
actually
nothing
on
the
subject
whatsoever.
and
the
trial
court
makes
no
mention
of
this
whatsoever,
within
approximately
40
seconds
to
a
minute,
the
time
very
slightly
from
witness
to
witness,
off
go
the
teargas
and
then
other
chaos
was
created
unnaturally.
but
in
any
event,
cox
is
not
arrested
that
day.
he's
arrested
the
next
day.
the
why,
this
was
never
been
satisfactorily
explained.
he
was
arrested
the
next
day
for
the
three
crimes
of
which
i
have
mentioned.
at
--
in
any
event,
i
would
like
to
be
--
its
interesting
to
note,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
the
justices
--
in
the
trial
court
judge's
opinion
below,
he
cites
as
his
reason
for
deciding
the
case
this
way,
and
i
read
from
page
10
(a)
of
the
appendix,
the
very
bottom
of
the
page.
it
must
be
recognized
to
be
inherently
dangerous
and
a
breach
of
a
peace
to
bring
1500
people,
colored
people,
down
in
the
predominantly
white
business
district
in
the
city
of
baton
rouge
and
congregate
across
the
street
from
the
courthouse
and
sing
songs
as
described
to
me
by
the
defendant
as
the
core
national
anthem
carrying
lines
such
as
“both
black
and
white
together”
and
to
urge
those
1500
people
to
descend
upon
our
lunch
counters
and
sit
there
until
they
are
served.
mr.
carl
rachlin
at
page
10
(a)
of
the
appendix.
mr.
carl
rachlin
oh,
to
the
--
to
our
consolidated
brief,
your
honor,
we
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
consolidated
brief
has
an
appendix
attached
to
it.
mr.
carl
rachlin
in
page
10
(a)
at
the
back
of
the
appendix,
after
the
blue
page.
mr.
carl
rachlin
the
very
--
i
was
reading
from
the
last
nine
or
ten
lines,
and
the
very
last
thought
expressed
by
judge
blanche,
that
has
to
be
an
inherent
breach
of
the
peace
and
our
statute
14.103.1
has
made
it
so.
now
when
we
get
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana,
for
some
very
interesting
reason
not
explicable,
even
though
judge
blanche
made
no
particular
findings
of
fact,
except
as
they
are
informally
set
forth
in
his
oral
opinion
at
--
in
the
appendix
here,
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
suddenly
picks
and
chooses
from
amongst
facts
that
apparently
pleased
it
and
found
a
complete
different
juxtaposition
of
the
events
that
transpired
instead
of
the
sheriff
intervening
at
the
point
cox
said,
“let's
eat”.
i
read
from
19
--
the
top
of
19
(a)
in
--
oh,
on
the
very
last
line
of
18
(a),
“he
admonished
the
multitude
of
demonstrators
to
remain
peaceful
and
generally
build
them
up
emotionally
for
further
sit-in
demonstrations
which
he
instructed
them
to
conduct
at
lunch
counters
in
the
business
district
of
the
city
upon
leaving
the
scene”.
reading
the
next
paragraph
one
would
never
get
the
under
--
get
the
fact
that
at
this
point
the
sheriff
did
intervene
and
said,
“break
up
the
meeting”,
because
the
judge,
judge
summers
then
talks
about
other
events
transpiring
before
the
sheriff
intervened.
now
where
the
judge
finds
this
as
a
fact,
i
don't
think
anywhere
in
the
record
this
is
born
out.
but
in
any
event
under
the
cases
decided
so
often
by
this
court
and
most
recently
in
edwards,
this
court
has
the
authority
and
the
right
to
reexamine
the
facts
in
any
particular
--
in
a
particular
(inaudible)
first
amendment
case.
now
at
every
point
along
the
way
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
the
transcript
that
we
have
appealed
in
forma
pauperis
and
there
is
a
single
transcript
of
the
record.
mr.
carl
rachlin
a
typed
transcript
and
on
file
with
the
clerk
of
this
court.
mr.
carl
rachlin
i'm
asking
your
honor
to
read
and
study,
yes
your
honor.
but
we
hope
that
in
our
appendix
that
we
have
included
all
the
important
papers.
for
it
--
for
that
very
reason
we
did
put
them
in
the
appendix,
the
judge
--
the
various
judges'
opinions
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
--
and
motions
to
quash
all
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
only
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
the
segregated
courtroom
which
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
well,
the
original
is
here
before
the
court
except
that
we
have
not
had
it
printed
up.
mr.
carl
rachlin
yes,
mr.
justice?
mr.
carl
rachlin
that's
24
your
honor.
mr.
carl
rachlin
that
is
a
little
further
on
and
in
the
record
and
in
the
appendix.
and
that
begins
on
page
28
(a)
of
the
appendix,
the
opinion
is
by
another
judge,
judge
carney
who
was
the
chief
justice.
mr.
carl
rachlin
no
your
honor,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
may
i
read
from
page
364
of
the
record.
mr.
carl
rachlin
this
is
completely
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
--
out
of
the
whole
colloq,
and
i
will
read
precisely
what
the
sheriff
said
on
that
point.
i
had
no
objection
to
his
being
there
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
there's
absolutely
no
support
in
the
record
that
cox
continued
the
speech
one
second
after
the
sheriff
intervened.
and
what
was
objectionable
question,
answer,
“the
inflammatory
manner
in
which
he
addressed
that
crowd
and
told
them
to
go
on
uptown.
go
to
--
for
a
place
to
sit
down
for
one
hour”.
the
--
this
is
the
point
the
speech
became
objectionable
to
the
sheriff
and
he
said
this
took
place
at
the
end
of
cox's
speech.
that
point
is
made
again
by
chief
--
police
chief
white
at
page
376
of
the
record.
“at
what
point
did
it
become
disorderly,
sir?”
“at
the
conclusion
of
cox's
speech”,
that's
when
he
made
the
reference
to
going
down
to
the
lunch
counters.
so
not
only
does
the
sheriff
say
that
but
the
chief
of
police
say
precisely
the
same
thing.
and
they
were
the
two
closest
people
to
cox
at
that
moment.
mr.
carl
rachlin
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
carl
rachlin
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
district
attorney
made
a
motion
at
the
opening
of
the
trial
to
consolidate
the
trials
of
all
the
cases
and
that
motion
was
exceeded
to
and
only
one
record
was
taken
for
all
cases.
mr.
carl
rachlin
both
your
honor,
both,
because
we
say
there
was
--
first
of
all
the
juxtaposition
of
time
is
completely
put
out
of
order
by
the
judge's
opinion.
mr.
carl
rachlin
it
would
because
if
the
interruption
to
the
speech
takes
place
when
cox
was
making
a
peaceful
statement
urging
them,
the
people
present,
to
exercise
a
right
or
at
least
attempt
to
exercise
a
right
granted
by
this
court
under
garner,
and
that
is
the
motivating
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
--
factor
for
the
sheriff
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
to
have
it
--
to
--
i
say
that
this
court
certainly
permitted
or
reversed
the
conviction
in
which
there
was
no
evidence
that
a
sit-in
demonstrator
committed
any
illegal
act
beyond
the
fact
of
sitting
quietly
inside
a
restaurant.
that
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
--
showed
no
evidence
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
not
in
garner,
no.
mr.
carl
rachlin
no,
i
--
all
i
say
to
that,
he
was
--
if
--
he
was
asking
the
people
in
a
sense
to
re
(inaudible)
--
to
reinstate
or
reinstitute
the
same
precise
fact
pattern
that
existed
in
garner
in
the
hopes
that
that
they
would
therefore
be
allowed
to
indicate
their
desire
to
be
served.
mr.
carl
rachlin
i'm
not
--
that
is
an
issue
in
this
case
at
all
your
honor.
i
don't
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
no,
not
at
all.
all
i'm
saying
is
he
made
a
perfectly
peaceful
statement
which
offended
the
sheriff.
and
that's
what
--
not
that
cox
did
anything
or
said
anything
which
was
wrong
or
violated
any
of
the
principles
of
any
of
the
cases
previously
decided
by
this
court.
the
sheriff
interrupted
not
because
cox
took
too
long
or
there
was
any
serious
problem,
he
interrupted
because
he
didn't
like
what
cox
said
at
that
given
moment.
mr.
carl
rachlin
well,
fortunately
i
can
answer
that
question
in
--
academically
since
that
isn't
the
facts
in
this
case.
well
speaking
for
myself
your
honor,
if
the
people
behaved
in
a
peaceful
manner,
what
the
--
and
caused
no
other
disturbance
other
than
they
are
sitting
there
quietly
and
do
not
do
any
--
commit
any
violence
against
the
property
other
than
by
sitting
there,
for
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
that
should
be
a
constitutional
protected
right.
but
i
know
that
court
has
not
--
this
court
has
not
yet
said
that.
i
hope
someday
it
will.
mr.
carl
rachlin
not
at
all,
not
at
all.
we're
saying
he
said
something
absolutely
peaceful
and
he
should
not
have
been
interrupted.
and
the
order
of
the
police
was
illegal
even
if
cox
said,
“don't
move”,
which
we
dispute.
even
if
cox
said,
“don't
you
--
don't
move”,
this
was
an
illegal
order
and
i
think
as
citizens,
we
have
an
obligation
to
refuse
to
obey
an
obviously
illegal
and
discriminatory
order
issued
by
the
police.
i
think
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
your
honor
in
this
case
the
state
permitted
this
demonstration
in
front
of
the
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
we
don't
have
an
edwards
situation.
mr.
carl
rachlin
no,
because
if
there
had
been
a
regulatory
reasonable
statute
or
regulatory
reasonable
regulations,
we
could
have
a
different
situation.
but
there
is
an
absolute
prohibitory
statute
combined
with
an
agreement
by
the
police
to
permit
this
activity.
and
we
say
the
interruption
was
an
unconstitutional
interruption
because
of
the
reason
that
the
facts
show.
in
any
event,
i
--
in
the
short
time
left
to
me,
i
wish
to
point
out
that
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
has
interpreted
the
breach
of
this
peace
statute
in
a
way
which
completely
violates
the
interpretation
by
this
court
in
the
terminiello
case.
now
most
people
confuse
terminiello
as
being
a
case
going
on
the
question
of
what
the
man
said
and
who
said
what
to
whom.
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
question
went
on
the
trial
--
on
the
charge
of
the
jury
and
the
affirmance
by
the
illinois
court
solely
on
the
question
of
how
illinois
interpreted
its
own
breach
of
the
peace
statute.
now
this
court,
louisiana
supreme
court
said,
and
i
quote
from
it's
opinion
below
on
page
23
(a)
of
the
appendix,
“to
disturb
the
peace
in
louisiana
means
to
agitate,
to
arouse
from
a
state
of
repose,
to
molest,
to
interrupt,
to
hinder,
to
disquiet”.
and
that
we
urge
upon
this
court
that
that
type
of
interpretation
of
its
own
statute
completely
violates
the
concepts
decided
by
this
court
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
rachlin
page
23
(a)
in
the
appendix
at
the
very
back
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
about
eight
lines
from
the
bottom.
“to
disturb
the
peace
in
louisiana
means,
to
agitate
--"
mr.
carl
rachlin
i
would
just
like
to
add
briefly
our
concern
about
the
issue
of
a
segregated
courtroom.
a
motion
was
made
at
the
trial
to
desegregate
the
court.
the
motion
was
denied.
we
urge
that
in
a
case
of
this
kind
where
a
defendant
is
himself
involved
in
a
situation
where
he
has
asked
for
desegregation
of
facilities
to
be
tried
in
a
desegregated
courtroom
where
the
judge
who
issues
an
opinion
such
as
we
have
read
on
10
(a)
of
the
appendix
indicates
a
built
--
such
a
built-in
prejudice
that
it
is
impossible
to
have
a
fair
trial.
and
we
say
that
is
to
segregate
a
courtroom
is
itself
a
violation
of
due
process.
i
hope
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
carl
rachlin
apparently,
i
have
misled
your
honor.
we
have
on
page
3
of
our
reply
to
the
motion
of
the
appellee
to
affirm
and/or
dismiss,
prepared
a
footnote
at
the
bottom
thereof.
mr.
carl
rachlin
this
is
our
reply
to
the
motion
of
appellee
to
affirm
and/or
dismiss.
mr.
carl
rachlin
i'm
sorry
your
honor?
mr.
carl
rachlin
yes,
and
the
footnote
says,
it
is
claimed
that
reverend
cox
said,
"don't
move"
when
the
sheriff
instructed
the
students
to
move
on.
this
in
itself
is
an
extraordinary
conclusion
to
draw
from
the
evidence.
only
three
witnesses
recollected
this
phrase,
and
we
give
the
citations
to
the
record,
and
five
others
remembered
no
such
thing.
reverend
cox
himself
recollected
saying,
“don't
run”
a
phrase
within
altogether
a
different
meaning.
the
trial
judge
avoided
the
whole
question
by
holding
that
it
was
an
inherently
dangerous
for
negroes
to
demonstrate
in
front
of
the
courthouse.
in
the
end,
this
dispute
over
the
facts
serves
only
to
illustrate
the
difficulties
presented
by
appellee's
characterization.
mr.
carl
rachlin
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
carl
rachlin
that's
right.
mr.
carl
rachlin
well,
yes,
we
say
that
man
did
nothing
wrong
and
the
police
order
was
illegal,
that
the
sheriff
had
no
right
to
make
this
order.
mr.
carl
rachlin
we
don't
dispute
that
three
witnesses
said
it.
we
say
that
that
sheriff's
order
was
an
unconstitutional
order
and
he
had
no
right
to
make
that
order
and
we
have
an
obligation
to
refuse
to
obey
that
order.
mr.
carl
rachlin
yes.
mr.
carl
rachlin
there
was
some
evidence,
yes.
mr.
carl
rachlin
no.
mr.
carl
rachlin
yes
your
honor,
there
were
two
(inaudible)
two
comments
on
that.
one,
the
fact
finder
that
is
the
trial
judge
makes
no
such
finding.
mr.
carl
rachlin
yes.
mr.
carl
rachlin
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
carl
rachlin
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
carl
rachlin
but
he
chose
to
make
an
opinion.
mr.
carl
rachlin
that
he
failed?
yes
there
is
some
evidence
your
honor,
but
we
say
we
have
to
go
behind
the
sheriff's
order,
made
a
refusal
to
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
if
--
looking
at
in
the
point
of
view
of
the
issue
of
whether
there
was
or
was
not
a
clear
and
present
danger,
yes
this
court
would
have
to
accept
the
thought
that
there
he
failed
to
move
on.
mr.
carl
rachlin
your
honor
i'm
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
we
say
that
this
statute
fails
to
meet
the
standards
set
forth
in
edwards
and
terminiello.
and
the
circumstances
by
which
this
orders
--
order
was
given
was
such
an
unconstitutional
discriminatory
order
that
cox
had
no
obligation
to
move
on,
just
as
this
court
has
held
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
--
many,
many
times.
it
was
not
necessarily
an
obligation
to
move
on
when
it's
made.
this
is
a
risk
of
citizen
takes
in
a
democracy,
but
it's
a
risk
worth
taking
as
compared
with
the
dictatorial
countries
that
we've
seen
--
mr.
carl
rachlin
no,
we
say
in
this
case
they
had
no
right
to
break
up
this
speech
meeting
as
they
did.
mr.
carl
rachlin
we
don't
--
we
go
along
with
the
thought
that
given
the
right
kind
of
reasonable
regulation
that
the
state
has
every
power
to
do
that,
but
that
--
though
none
of
those
facts
are
present.
the
state
permitted
this
meeting.
they
saw
the
size
of
the
crowd.
the
state
pulled
--
picked
the
place
of
the
meeting
and
we
exceeded
to
that.
mr.
carl
rachlin
only
if
there
is
--
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
prior
part
of
the
statute,
and
we
say
the
way
that
reading
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana,
they
have
so
interpreted
their
own
statute
as
not
to
warn
anybody
of
what
the
risk
is.
merely
refusing
to
move
is
not
in
and
of
itself
a
crime.
it
has
to
be
tied
to
some
other
illegal
act,
and
the
two
parts
and
your
honor
himself
mentioned
earlier
in
this
discussion,
and
i
say
the
--
those
facts
are
not
present
in
this
case.
if
he
was
doing
nothing
at
all
which
required
him
to
move
on
because
the
state
had
permitted
this
meeting
and
they
interrupted
for
discriminatory
reason,
and
therefore
the
meeting
--
the
sheriff
did
not
have
the
right
to
make
the
order
he
did
at
all.
even
if
--
and
i
say
further,
it's
not
--
it
was
on
--
it
was
not
an
understandable
order
in
the
first
place,
so
i
don't
know
what
“move
on”
means
to
people
of
2000,
when
2000
people
are
congregated
on
a
small
area.
i
don't
know
what
“move
on”
means
frankly,
i
don't
know.
and
i
don't
think
the
sheriff
knew
what
he
was
saying.
he
was
just
so
mad
because
cox
was
suggesting
that
they
have
a
sit-in
because
you
read
everybody's
testimony.
this
was
the
sticking
point
in
every
single
witness's
mind
that
cox
said,
“let's
eat”
and
place
more
parts
so
far
as
the
police
were
concerned.
and
when
you
have
that
kind
of
a
sequence
of
events,
if
the
sheriff
had
not
interrupted
that
meeting
would've
ended
a
moment
or
two
later
in
a
peaceful
fashion.
there
would've
been
no
problem
whatsoever.
it
was
the
police
that
caused
the
trouble
in
this
situation
and
they
caused
it
we
say
for
discriminatory,
illegal,
unconstitutional
reason.
mr.
carl
rachlin
yes,
your
honor
we
have.
mr.
carl
rachlin
yes,
your
honor
we
have
done
that.
mr.
carl
rachlin
we
have
attempted
and
i
hope
persuasively
to
suggest
the
ambiguity
of
the
language
and
why
we
think
it
is
not
appropriate.
mr.
carl
rachlin
why
do
i
think
it
is?
mr.
carl
rachlin
yes,
we
point
out
in
our
brief
your
honor.
thank
you
your
honor
for
the
opportunity.
i
see
i've
exceeded
my
time.
mr.
carl
rachlin
i
enjoyed
it.
