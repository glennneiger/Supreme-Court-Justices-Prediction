justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
seem
to
have
it
mr.
rachlin.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there's
a
lot
of
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
a
transcript
to
the
file
record
herein?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
typed
transcript?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you're
asking
us
then
to
study
that,
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
excerpted
portions
anywhere
of
the
trial
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
are
going
to
do
what
you
ask
us
to
do
without
reading
the
original?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
earlier
mr.
rachlin
that
there's
just
one
trial
record
for
all
three
convictions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
sorry
mr.
rachlin,
am
i
--
are
we
still
looking
at
this
consolidated
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
find
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
looking
at
that
but
where
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see,
yes,
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
that
a
violation
of
anything?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though,
well
perhaps
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understood
that
mr.
rachlin
told
us
that
the
record
showed
that
march
was
authorized
by
the
appropriate
municipal
officials.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
doesn't
that
suggest
then
that
at
least
that
much
that
is
the
actual
conduct
of
the
meeting
for
some
limited
period
of
time
was
authorized?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
the
issue
was,
in
this
case,
arise
out
of
the
events
at
the
end
of
the
seven
minutes
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
whatever
that
interval
was.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
after
anything
up
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
he
didn't?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
wait
a
minute,
which
is
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
in
24?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
mr.
rachlin,
i'm
just
--
as
i
understand
your
proposition
that
is
in
effect
you
should
apply
the
(inaudible)
rule
here,
namely
that
there's
no
evidence
whatever
to
support
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
findings
or
conviction
based
on
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
necessary
proof
or
necessary
ingredient
from
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
your
footnote
itself
says
only
three
witnesses
did
recollect
that
phrase,
don't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
langua
--
this
statute
as
i
understand
is
the
identical
counterpart
of
the
statute
which
relates
to
the
demonstrations
on
a
stadium.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
they've
dedicate
with
the
federal
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
i
gather
mr.
douglas,
but
maybe
i
don't
want
to
assure
mr.
rachlin's
position,
but
i
gather
yours
on
the
facts
is
that
there
was
testimony
“move
on”
even
though
it's
contradicted
than
it
may
have
been
inconsistent
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
was
the
original
filed
brief.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
then
wouldn't
--
do
you
think
we
would
be
precluded
because
it
was
not
made
by
the
clerk
of
louisiana
supreme
court
prior
to
the
record
sent
up
here.
will
we
be
precluded
from
considering
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
roy,
what
if
--
is
that
all
that
any
witness
attributes
to
cox
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
move.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
tell
me,
which
are
the
convictions
are
you
addressing
yourself
to
now,
mr.
roy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
the
obstruction
--
or
rather
around
the
courthouse?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
not
the
obstruction
--
not
about
it,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
cox?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i'm
anxious
to
get
mr.
roy
is,
whether
he
--
any
witness
says
that
cox
said
anything
else
from
that
occasion.
we
heard
something
yesterday
about
--
not
only
don't
move
but
go
sit
down
and
other
restaurant
and
so
forth.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i'm
interested
in
mr.
roy
is,
i
thought
it
was
suggested
yesterday
that
more
than
don't
move
was
said
by
cox,
that
cox
ordered
the
group
to
go
sit
down
in
other
restaurants
in
town.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
did
not
happen.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
before
the
order
of
proceedings
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
didn't
you
read
the
testimony
earlier?
was
it
of
the
sheriff
that
the
agreement
was
that
at
the
conclusion
of
the
demonstration,
seven
minutes
or
whatever
it
was,
that
they
had
committed
themselves
to
return
to
the
campus?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
roy,
going
back
to
the
appellate
that
you
and
i
had
yesterday,
in
which
as
i
understood
you
and
perhaps
i
was
wrong.
that
the
--
you
would
concede
that
indeed,
whatever
the
circumstances,
they'd
had
the
permission
of
the
police
to
come
out
with
those
two
blocks,
whatever
the
reason
that
the
police
gave
us,
to
the
side
of
the
courthouse.
do
you
--
is
it
your
position
that
if
that
is
relevant
to
the
breach
of
peace
and
obstruction
of
the
sidewalk
condition,
that
it
might
not
be
relevant
to
the
offense
that
we're
now
talking
about,
that
is
obstructing
justice
of
the
courthouse,
that
if
it
excuse
the
basis
for,
or
rather
in
the
phase
of
the
consent
of
the
police,
there
could
perhaps
not
be
a
conviction
on
the
breach
of
peace
for
obstructing
the
sidewalk
but
even
if
that
were
true,
they'd
still
be
properly
convicted
under
this
statute
because
the
chief
of
police
could
not
give
them
a
permission
in
the
face
of
the
language
of
that
statute.
that
his
permission
would
go
no
farther
than
that
bare
on
the
factual
question
of
their
intent
to
obstruct.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
believe
it
could
be
the
amelioration
of
the
sentence
but
not
really
relevant
to
the
--
