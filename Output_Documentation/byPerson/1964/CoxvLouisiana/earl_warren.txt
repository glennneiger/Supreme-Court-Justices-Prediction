then
contradicted
that
the
--
in

record
that
the

said
“wait
a
minute”?
chief

it
is
contradicted?
chief

mr.
roy,
you
will

of

will
you
please?
the
one
you

given
to

have
you
completed
your
argument,
mr.
douglas?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
roy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
roy,
may
i
ask
you
when,
according
to
your
theory,
was
this
crime
initiated?
when
did
it
started?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
evidence
to
that
effect
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)to
the
effect
that
they
conspired
to
commit
this
crime.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
you
think
the
--
that
the
mere
presence
of
these
people
at
the
place
where
they
were
at
this
time
was
a
violation
of
the
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
the
mere
fact
that
they
agreed
to
protest
is
in
itself
a
part
of
this
crime?
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
i
--
do
i
understand
mr.
roy
that
it's
your
position
that
even
if
the
chief
of
police
did
give
them
permission
to
be
on
this
side
of
the
street
with
their
people
and
to
give
the
pledge
of
allegiance
that
they
did
and
to
sing
religious
songs
as
they
did,
and
to
speak
as
mr.
cox
did,
but
they're
still
guilty
of
--
without
moore,
of
violating
this
particular
statute.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
mean
without
the
things
that
followed
--
followed,
that
suppose
he
--
suppose
he
had
him
said,
now,
don't
move
after
it
was
all
over,
would
they
had
been
in
violation
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
isn't
that
--
isn't
any
parade
through
the
streets
an
interference
with
traffic
and
if
it's
done
without
authority,
isn't
that
a
violation
of
the
law
normally
in
normal
life?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
do
you
--
do
you
say
that
the
police
are
not
authorized
to
give
people
permission
to
parade
through
the
streets
even
under
certain
regulations,
even
though
it
does
interfere
with
the
traffic?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
do
and
it
is
well
recognized,
is
it
not?
and
the
common
practice
where
the
police
to
regulate
it
that
most
cities
have
some
kind
of
ordinance,
giving
them
that
authority
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
you
think
that
the
conduct
before
the
chief
of
police
told
them
to
disband
and
move
on
was
in
itself
sufficient
to
sustain
a
conviction
even
though
the
chief
of
police
had
told
him
after
knowing
that
they
intended
to
do
these
things
that
they're
kept
on
one
side
of
the
street,
to
say
that
that
it
was
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
always
parades
in
baton
rouge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
have
you
ever
have
any
ropes
along
the
sidewalk
to
keep
people
who
are
watching
from
getting
into
the
streets.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
wasn't
the
police
department
exercising
the
same
authority
here
that
it
was
exercising
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
understood
you
to
say,
there
was
no
law
requirement
in
your
--
so
that
you
had
absolutely
no
regulation
of
any
kind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
how
do
they
get
--
how
do
they
get
that
authority
for
parade?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where's
the
contact
here
with
the
police
and
the
police
eventually
said
whether
you
like
it
or
not,
there
might
be
a
lot
of
parades
that
police
don't
like
but
if
they
say,
you
can
have
your
parade
and
if
you
do
so
then
the
people
do
so,
why
isn't
that
legal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah,
but
who
is
the
chief
police
officer
in
that
city?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
is
the
chief
of
police
and
it
was
the
sheriff
--
a
deputy
sheriff
whom
--
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
chief
white
was
the
man
who
gave
them
the
permission
to
do
that,
wasn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
were
at
the
same
procedure
house.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
arrested
these
23
men
the
day
before?
was
it
the
sheriff
or
the
chief
of
police?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
city
police.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
said
it
does
require
intent.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
statute
says
that
whoever
with
the
intent
of
interfering
with
and
obstructing
or
impeding
the
administration
of
justice
or
with
the
intent
of
influencing
any
judge,
juror,
witness
or
court
officer,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
roy,
i
want
to
say
to
you
before
you
sit
down
that
i
regret
that
you
were
not
served
with
the
printed
copy
of
this
--
of
this
brief.
you
should
have
been
just
to
whose
fault
it
is,
i
don't
know.
my
usual
practice
is
to
send
this
informal
conference
case
and
the
court's
prints
of
briefs
for
the
parties
and
the
usual
practice
has
been
to
send
it
to
the
copy
--
or
send
the
copies
to
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
and
he
serves
among
the
other
counsel
and
it
was
assumed
that
that
would
be
done
in
this
case
but
there
was
no
direct
instructions
to
him
to
do
that
so
it
made
them
our
fault
to
the
draw
this
counsel,
but
at
all
events,
i'm
sorry
you
didn't
receive
one
even
at
this
late
page.
we
will
see
that
you
are
served.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
douglas.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
douglas,
how
long
--
how
long
were
these
men
in
jail
before
they
were
released?
