mr.
ralph
l.
roy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
trial
court
in
these
two
cases
in
the
supreme
court
is
indicated
by
opposing
counsel
interprets
this
record
factually
different
from
his
interpretation.
the
record
as,
i
interpret
it
and
as
incidentally
the
state
supreme
court
interprets
it
and
so
does
the
trial
judge,
is
substantially
that
23
negro
students
from
southern
university
which
is
located
about
five
miles
north
of
the
city
of
baton
rouge
had
been
arrested
on
charges
that
i
think
they
were
trespassing
charges.
the
following
day,
well
that
following
evening,
that
same
evening,
appellant
got
together
with
some
core
members
from
southern
university
and
held
a
meeting
and
decided
to
come
downtown
baton
rouge
the
following
day
in
order
to
“protest
the
illegal
arrest
of
these
23
students
on
the
previous
day”.
and
they
came
into
baton
rouge
by
bus,
by
car
and
by
marching
from
all
directions.
some
witnesses
said
they
thought
there
were
about
1500
and
others
said
3800,
there
were
approximately
2000.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no
sir,
your
honor,
but
there
is
a
state
law
and
there
may
be
a
city
ordinance
but
it's
not
involved
in
this
case.
but
i'm
not
aware
if
any
there
is.
but
there
is
a
state
law
against
obstructing
the
normal
use
of
a
sidewalk
or
a
street.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
by
a
crowd,
yes
sir,
and
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
arrangements
are
usually
made
if
--
depending
on
the
size
of
the
demonstration
of
course.
arrangements
made
with
the
officials
and
their
cooperation
is
not
only
required
but
it's
needed
where
you
have
such
a
large
crowd.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes,
there
was
radio
announcement
to
the
fact
that
these
people
intended
to
come
downtown
and
intended
to
demonstrate.
there
was
no
request
or
either
permission
or
cooperation
on
the
part
of
the
officials.
and
as
i
said,
they
came
down
and
congregated
as
the
--
at
the
whole
state
capital
which
its
grounds
which
is
located
about
two
blocks
from
the
courthouse
where
these
23
prisoners
who
were
incarcerated
the
day
before
were
housed.
the
parish
jail
being
--
atop
the
parish
courthouse,
and
although
there
is
space
to
hold
a
meeting
or
a
demonstration
on
the
whole
state
capital
grounds,
they
marched
over
the
two
blocks
to
the
immediate
west
side
of
the
courthouse.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that
was
a
--
the
state
contends
a
violation
of
the
law
relative
to
crowding
and
congregating
and
thereby
willfully
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
--
obstructing
the
normal
use
of
a
sidewalk.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well,
i
was
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well,
it
developed
factually
this
way
as
--
of
course
the
information
was
on
the
radio
as
i
said
and
one
of
the
officials
approached
the
crowd
and
inquired
as
to
who
their
leader
was
and
the
appellant
of
that
was
designated
as
the
leader
and
he
talked
to
the
police
officers.
also,
asked
him
what
his
purpose
was
and
he
said,
whereas
to
the
effect,
he
had
come
down
to
protest
the
illegal
arrest
of
these
people,
and
the
officer
told
him
in
effect,
and
i
think
the
record
will
show
this
that
this
was
a
matter
for
the
courts,
and
he
said
he
was
going
to
demonstrate
anyway.
he
was
downtown
with
his
crowd.
so
the
officer
said
he
--
he
then
told
him,
“well,
how
long
is
it
going
to
take?”
and
he
said,
“about
seven
minutes”.
and
he
told
him,
“well,
alright,
go
ahead”.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
consider
that
as
permission.
it
was
more
of
a
tolerance,
but
i'll
concede
it
because
i
don't
think
it's
of
any
importance.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that's
correct.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
and
also,
i
might
add
also,
testified
that
he
was
rather
apprehensive
about
refusing
to
let
him
go
any
farther.
he
was
in
hopes
that
they
would
do
what
the
fellow
claimed
he
would
do
and
then
disperse.
and
that's
why
he
did
what
he
did
for
the
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
--
best
interest
of
the
community
in
his
testimony.
they
went
on
down
across
the
street
from
the
courthouse
and
as
previously
stated,
completely
blocked
the
sidewalk.
and
the
officers,
there
were
some
80
officers
across
the
street
and
some
white
people
congregated,
they
sang
a
few
songs,
pledged
allegiance
to
the
flag
and
appellant
made
a
short
talk.
toward
the
end,
telling
these
people
to
go
to
the
white
lunch
counters
that
some
of
them
didn't
serve
negroes
but
that
--
to
stay
in
there.
if
they
were
refused
to
stay
in
there
and
stay
an
hour
if
necessary
until
you're
served.
well
about
that
time,
the
23
who
had
been
incarcerated
up
in
the
jail
and
who
about
a
hundred
feet,
i
would
imagine,
from
where
the
demonstrators
were,
started
yelling
and
screaming
and
beating
on
the
jail
walls.
and
responding
in
return
was
had
by
the
2000
people
downstairs
and
quite
a
commotion
developed,
plenty
of
noise,
no
physical
violence,
but
plenty
of
noise.
and
the
sheriff
then
informed
appellant
that
this
thing
is
getting
out
of
hand,
you
better
disperse.
and
he
did
tell
him
twice,
the
record
will
show
this,
and
some
of
the
evidence
says
that
the
appellant
told
his
members,
“don't
move”,
and
in
any
event
when
this
thing
as
the
sheriff
said
got
to
ripe
for
the
riot
and
you
could
feel
the
tenseness
in
the
atmosphere
that
the
(inaudible)
used
to
disperse
the
crowd.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
teargas
bombs.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
between
75
and
80,
i
understand.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
he
was
convicted
of
violating
three.
we
--
we're
only
concerned
with
two
at
this
moment,
r.s.
14.100.1
and
100.3,
one
of
them
deals
with
the
willfully
obstructing
the
normal
use
of
a
sidewalk
and
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well,
i
don't
think
that
statute
requires
a
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir,
well
he
certainly
congregated
with
others
there
and
the
sidewalk
was
completely
blocked.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
and
the
statute
does
not
require
an
absolute
disturbance.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes,
and
that's
as
part
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes,
as
part
of
the
statute.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir,
that's
part
of
the
--
in
the
statute
they'd
found.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that's
correct.
we're
not
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
not
alone.
of
course
we
are
claiming
also
that
the
statement
to
the
fact
and
this
was
of
course
prior
to
the
civil
rights
act,
but
the
statements
to
the
fact
to
go
to
the
feeding
places
where
they
won't
serve
you
and
if
they
refused
to
stay
there
was
not
a
lawful
statement.
it
was
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
it
was
encouraging
people
to
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no
sir,
he's
not.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
i
think
the
trial
judge
did
that.
i
think
he
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
i
think
that
statement
--
from
that
statement,
the
trial
court
found
the
intent
to
commit
a
breach
of
the
peace.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
found
that
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that's
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well,
i
think
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
from
the
statement,
and
i
think
of
course
--
as
i
said,
i
think
that's
only
one
of
the
elements,
one
of
the
ingredients
of
this
offense.
you
have
to
have
an
obstructing
of
the
sidewalk,
congregating
rather.
another
essential
element
is
that
there
has
to
be
an
intent
to
commit
a
breach
of
the
peace
or
where
one
might
be
occasioned.
and
then
thirdly
of
course
there
has
to
be
this
refusal
to
disperse
when
ordered
to
do
so.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
i
understand-
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes.
well,
your
honor
i
don't
know
whether
this
was
--
i
imagined
it
was
an
oversight,
but
i
assure
you
that
the
record
will
amply
support
that
one
particular
ingredient.
that
is
that
this
appellant
was
ordered
to
disperse.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
and
that
he
did
not.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
this
was
a
district
court
which
is
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
--
of
general
juris
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that's
correct.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
he
acts
in
his
real
life
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that's
correct,
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes,
i
think
you'll
find
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
i
think
you
will
find
the
record,
the
transcript
available
in
this
case,
supports
what
was
said
by
the
trial
court
and
by
the
supreme
court,
although
the
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes,
i
understand
that
to
be
one
of
their
contentions.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no
sir,
i
haven't.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
and
that
i
might
add
is
a
defense
witness.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that's
a
defendant
witness.
this
witness
you're
quoting
is
a
--
what
was
his
name?
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
but
what
was
the
name
sir?
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
and
i
think
it
was
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
i
think
it
is.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes,
and
there's
much
more
which
i
understand
is
in
the
record.
there's
only
one
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
the
record,
i'll
speak
of
the
transcript
of
the
evidence.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
you
have
a
very
--
a
very
small
part
of
it
was
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes,
i
could
do
that.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes,
i'd
have
to
go
through
the
record,
but
there
is
--
because
that
--
several
witnesses
said
this
and
the
record
is
all
about
600
pages.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that's
correct
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that's
louisiana
--
law,
so
may
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
and
that
issue
was
raised
in
louisiana
state
supreme
court
also,
and
that
is
the
state
law
too.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
i'll
be
happy
to.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir.
unless
there
are
any
other
questions,
i'll
just
be
seated.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
prosecution
on
louisiana
statute,
annotated
revised
statute,
section
4
--
title
xiv,
section
401,
which
is
an
identical
counterpart
of
a
federal
act
to
be
founded
18
u.s.c.
1507.
substantially,
these
acts
prohibit
the
picketing,
operating
in
or
near
courthouse
or
in
or
near
a
building
or
residence
occupied
or
used
by
a
judge,
juror,
witness
or
court
official
with
the
intent
of
interfering
with
obstructing
or
impeding
the
administration
of
justice
or
with
the
intent
of
influencing
any
such
official.
as
i
understood
the
appellant's
argument
yesterday,
understanding
to
be
first
that
although
he
recognizes
the
right
of
the
state
to
pass
such
a
law,
that
the
louisiana
supreme
court
and
the
louisiana
lower
court
applied
an
unconstitutional
standard
or
in
effect
did
not
apply
this
clear
and
present
danger
standard.
although
there
is
no
litigative
history
on
the
state,
nor
this
federal
statute,
appellant
relies
upon
the
history
of
cases
dealing
with
contempt
of
court
cases
wherein
it
was
overt
and
that
there
was
an
infringement
on
the
right
of
speech,
free
speech
and
freedom
of
the
press.
these
cases
of
course
deal
per
se
with
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
press.
these
contempt
cases
too
that
counsel
have
--
has
cited.
as
pointed
out
by
the
state's
supreme
court,
and
as
it's
known
by
everyone,
picketing
factually
is
not
the
equivalent
of
speech.
and
consequently,
as
this
court
has
said,
it
is
not
equal
in
legal
equivalent.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that's
correct.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that's
correct.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well,
first
of
all,
i
think
this
so-called
arrangement
here
is
quite
immaterial
because
i
don't
think
and
i
know
of
no
law
which
generally
justifies
an
officer
in
permitting
or
authorizing
another
to
violate
the
law.
now,
i
think
this
question
--
this
question
of
--
of
authority
was
in
part
in
the
cases
--
in
one
of
the
cases
yesterday,
into
the
breach
of
peace
case,
because
in
that
case,
one
of
the
elements
was
to
refuse
to
disburse
on
the
oath
of
an
officer.
now,
in
that
sense,
authorization
would
be
relevant
but
authorization
to
commit
crime
by
an
officer
or
anyone
else;
would
only
make
him
an
accomplice.
it
would
not
justify
or
legalize
the
act,
otherwise,
criminal.
now,
if
i
may
your
honor,
cite
from
the
record.
and
before
i
do
--
frankly,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
exactly
sure
what
the
record
is
up
here.
on
page
4
of
--
of
appellant's
brief,
down
at
the
bottom
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir,
but
i
have
a
--
a
very
facts
copy.
i've
never
been
--
been
furnished
with
any
printed
brief.
so
i've
--
i've
prepared
my
argument
and
my
brief
from
what
i've
received,
which
is
a
rare
facts
copy
of
a
consolidated
brief.
which
i
assumed
is
the
same
thing
that
you
have
printed
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no
sir,
it's
my
first
time
i've
seen
it.
now,
whether
our
page
numbers
correlate,
i
don't
know.
but
i
would
like
to
point
something
out
on
the
brief
i
have
of
appellant's
consolidated
brief
on
page
4.
at
the
bottom,
there's
a
asterisk
which
says
and
i
quote.
the
transcript
of
the
trial
in
the
district
court
made
by
a
court
stenographer
is
not
physically
a
part
of
the
record
prepared
by
the
clerk
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
to
supplement
the
records,
the
transcript
of
the
minutes
of
the
trial
which
has
been
submitted
to
this
court
is
referred
by
the
symbol
t.
now,
of
course
the
minutes
--
the
transcript
of
the
minutes,
do
not
include
the
transcript
of
the
evidence
that
was
taken
down
in
the
trial
court
although
the
appellant
in
his
brief
refers
frequently
to
the
transcript
taken
by
the
court
stenographer
in
the
trial
court.
now,
i
understand
from
the
opposing
counsel
that
--
that
the
transcript
of
the
evidence
has
been
filed
with
the
clerk,
although,
it
was
not
sent
up
by
the
clerk
of
the
supreme
court.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir,
louisiana
supreme
court
definitely
considered
it.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
whole
transcript
that
the
trial
court
was
made
part
of
a
bill
of
exception
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
in
arrest
of
judgment.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well,
i
don't
know
your
honor.
i
have
no
objection
in
fact
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
i
think
we
should
since
everybody
else
has
considered
--
considered
this
transcript.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir.
so
i'll
--
i'll
--
i'll
refer
it
to
you
with
reference
to
your
question.
as
i
say,
this
demonstration
was
initiated
and
preceded
up
to
a
certain
point
without
permission
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well,
i
wouldn't
--
i
wouldn't
say
that
if
there's
no
statute
given
--
given
such
authority
of
--
of
the
new
authority
to
keep
the
streets
open
and
the
sidewalks
open.
i
would
say
yes,
they
would
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
as
a
practical
matter,
they
--
they
contact
police
authorities
to
make
arrangements
if
you're
going
to
have
a
parade
for
blocking
off
streets
and
etcetera.
cooperating
and
to
see
that
the
parade
is
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
i
know
of
none.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that's
correct
sir.
now
as
you
may
recall,
this
congregation
gathered,
at
the
old
state
capitol
grounds
which
is
approximately
two
blocks
from
the
courthouse.
the
first
officer,
to
talk
to
appellant,
was
the
chief
criminal
deputy
of
the
sheriff
--
of
the
sheriff's
office
of
east
baton
rouge
parish.
here's
his
testimony,
the
transcript
of
the
trial
court
page
253,
and
i
quote,
and
i
asked
him
the
purpose
of
the
demonstration
--,
this
is
chief
kling
talking
about
his
conversation
with
cox.
and
i
asked
him
the
purpose
of
the
demonstration,
he
told
me
that
he
and
these
people
were
demonstrating
in
the
protest
of
the
illegal
arrest
of
some
of
their
people
who
have
been
held
and
jailed.
i
asked
him
if
he
didn't
think
the
court
was
the
proper
place
to
decide
the
legality
of
the
arrest.
and
i
told
him
further
that
the
accumulation
of
those
people
there,
creating
an
explosive
situation,
wouldn't
that
could
erupt
into
serious
trouble
and
i
asked
him
to
disband
them
and
take
them
back
from
whence
they
came.
question:
did
he
acquiesce
in
your
request?
he
did
not.
and
he
said,
i
told
him
the
second
time.
i
asked
him
to
disperse
the
people
in
interest
of
peace
and
harmony
and
he
told
me
he
was
coming
by
the
building
referring
to
the
court
building.
and
i
told
him
then
that
if
any
of
violence
resulted,
i
felt
that
it
would
be
his
responsibility
whether
he
say,
he
said
no,
it
would
be
the
police
officer's
responsibility
that
as
an
officer,
that
he
was
duly
to
bound
to
protect
him
and
the
other
people.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
the
appellant
told
the
police
officer
that
it
was
the
police
officer's
duty
to
protect
him,
his
--
the
appellant
and
his
followers.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
now
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
i
beg
pardon
sir?
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
this
--
i
started
to
read
from
the
transcript
page
253.
this
was
appellant's
first
encounter
with
any
police
officer.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir.
now,
this
was
prior
to
a
time
that
he
talked
to
chief
white.
this
was
about
one
block
from
where
he
spoke
to
chief
white.
now,
after
he
started
out
toward
the
courthouse
when
he
got
about
midway
between
from
where
he
had
left
on
the
old
state
capitol
grounds
to
the
courthouse,
chief
white
stopped
him.
and
at
page
371
of
this
transcript,
chief
white
said
with
reference
to
this
alleged
authorization.
at
that
time,
this
is
chief
white
talking,
at
that
time,
i
told
him
--,
told
cox,
that
he
was
he
was
confined
to
the
west
side
of
the
street.
this
of
course
was
not
--
i
didn't
mean
it
--
in
the
import
that
i
was
given
him
any
permission
to
do
it,
but
i
was
presented
with
a
situation
that
was
accomplished
and
i
had
to
make
a
decision
and
i
made
it
in
the
best
interest
of
community
safety
in
my
opinion.
and
then
at
page
372,
he
says,
as
he
started
to
leave,
captain
font
--
this
was
an
officer
with
chief
white,
suggested
to
me
that
we
find
out
from
him,
how
long
he
intended
to
have
this
meeting.
and
we
called
him
back
and
he
said
that
we
would
be
there
about
seven
minutes
and
then
that
they
would
return
to
the
campus
at
southern
university.
at
page
354
of
this
transcript,
which
includes
the
testimony
--
some
testimony
of
the
sheriff,
"i
grabbed
the
power
microphone,
i
didn't
grab
sergeant
(inaudible)
who
was
standing
by
and
i
took
this
power
microphone
and
i
said,
you
have
been
allowed
to
demonstrate.
up
until
now,
your
demonstration
has
been
more
or
less
peaceful.
but
what
you
are
doing
now
is
in
--
is
a
direct
violation
of
the
law,
it
disturbs
the
peace
and
it
has
got
to
be
broken
up
immediately.
question,
in
response
to
that
order,
did
they
disperse?
answer,
did
not.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well,
at
that
time,
the
yelling
and
screaming
from
the
23
up
in
the
jailhouse,
in
a
company
with
those
some
2000
down,
was
creating
quite
a
bit
of
noise
and
rocket
if
you
will.
and
some
of
the
witnesses
said
the
atmosphere
was
very
thin.
one
of
them
said,
he
thought
they
were
going
to
storm
the
courthouse.
this
was
the
--
the
way
of
expressing
the
feeling
around.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir.
and
this
is
--
this
is
why
the
state
contended
that
the
sheriff
ordered
this
to
be
broken
up.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well,
this
is
what
--
this
is
what
--
what
provoked
the
sheriff
to
make
the
request,
this
noise.
all
of
this
noise
provoked
the
sheriff
to
say,
well,
it's
time,
this
is
getting
out
of
hand
or
worse
to
that
effect.
and
then
the
response,
the
sheriff,
what
did
cox
do
in
response
to
that
order
about
breaking
it
up.
answer:
he
raised
his
hand
--
hands
in
this
manner
or
in
this
manner
indicating
he
doesn't
say.
i
don't
know
which.
the
tension
was
so
great
at
that
time.
i
could
be
mistaken
about
the
justice,
but
all
through
his
talking,
he
was
just
articulating
right
and
left
--
right
hand
and
left
hand.
he
said,
don't
move,
you
know
on
certain
times.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that's
page
354.
question:
that
was
in
response
to
your
order,
i
order
you
to
disperse?
answer:
yes.
did
the
crowd
obey
your
order
or
the
order
of
cox?
they
obeyed
his
order,
their
leader.
and
what
happened?
two
of
my
officers
crossed
the
street
and
they
said,
you
have
heard
what
the
sheriff
said
now,
do
what
he
said.
and
again
they
suggested,
i
don't
know
whether
the
same
words
were
said
or
not.
but
the
gesture
of
defiance
to
an
officer's
order
at
about
that
time,
the
first
teargas
was
exploded
to
the
crowd.
so
the
witnesses
in
other
force
of
this
transcript
said
that
he
nearly
looked
at
the
sheriff.
he
said
don't
move
and
turn
the
sheriff
folded
his
arms.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no
sir
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
for
example,
a
disinterested
witness
that
is
a
witness
not
connected
with
law
enforcement.
at
page
53
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
only
one.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
i
don't
believe
that
the
question
was
raised
but
i'll
be
happy
to
discuss.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
at
page
55
of
the
transcript
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir.
mr.
biossat,
b-i-o-s-s-a-t.
did
you
hear
cox
say,
don't
move?
answer:
yes
i
did.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes.
at
page
37
of
the
transcript,
this
witness
is
the
one
mr.
dupre
litton
a
local
attorney
who
happens
to
have
his
office
there
in
the
area.
describing
what
he
heard
and
apparently
he
said,
they
--
they
said
that
the
law
enforcement
officers
had
teargas
and
that
if
anybody
shut
that
teargas
that
nobody
was
going
to
move.
i
remember
that,
didn't
cox
also
told
what
other
witnesses
testified
too.
but
apparently,
from
that
i
gather,
and
i
think
it
can
be
gathered,
it's
probably
clear,
that
he
knew
that
these
officers
across
the
street
had
this
teargas
before
they
have
started
or
during
the
speech.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no
sir,
but
your
honor
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that
did
happen
but
that
happened
in
a
speech
that
preceded
this.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that's
correct.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
and
i
understand
--
i
understand,
appellant's
position
to
be
that
this
teargas
is
thrown
into
the
crowd
because
cox
was
telling
these
members
to
go
integrated
to
large
counters.
and
that
therefore,
this
was
an
opposition
to
the
views
held
by
the
sheriff
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
chief
deputy
white.
now,
this
set
of
--
this
transcript
is
as
i've
said
about
some
600
pages
long
and
varies
as
the
state
supreme
court
said,
they
had
ample
evidence
not
only
from
the
sheriff
or
the
police
officers
but
from
other
witnesses
who
happened
to
be
around
there
to
sustain
this
particular
conviction.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well,
i
think
it
started
in
a
conspirial
aspects
probably
that
the
evening
before
--
the
date
of
the
alleged
offense.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well,
they
didn't
call
it
a
crime.
they
of
course
called
it
freedom
of
speech
and
asserting
their
rights.
they
had
a
meeting
that
evening
and
appellant
was
there
and
another
official
of
core,
ronnie
moore,
who
didn't
make
it
down
to
the
courthouse
because
he
was
arrested
and
convicted
which
was
upheld.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
not
this
particular
law
because
it
requires
not
only
their
presence
at
this
particular
place
in
the
manner
suggested
crowding
or
picketing
in
or
near
the
courthouse,
not
only
as
that
required
but
that
also
is
required
an
intent
to
influence
a
court
official
or
to
impede
the
administration
of
justice.
this
is
required
and
we'll
get
this
requirement
from
their
proclaim
design
and
object
to
go
out
there
and
protest
this
illegal
arrest,
as
they
call
it.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir,
i
think
it
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
--
i
think
you
have
to
utilize
that
to
get
the
intent.
of
course,
the
intent
is
usually
approved
from
circumstances.
and
i
think
you
have
to
consider
that
in
order
to
deduct
an
intent
to
interfere
with
the
administration
of
justice
or
interfere
with
some
judge
or
some
court
official.
the
trial
judge
where
at
great
length
and
asking
ronnie
moore
on
the
witness
stand.
why
the
courthouse?
why
did
you
come
down
here?
why
not
on
the
old
state
capitol
grounds
or
some
other
part
of
town,
some
public
park,
why
here?
and
he
says,
well
if
he
is
where
they
were
arrested
and
we
came
to
protest
it,
we
came
here.
well,
what
did
you
hope
to
gain
by
doing
this?
what
did
you
hope
to
gain?
now,
he
said
something
about
love.
love,
on
the
hearts
of
men
or
worse
to
that
effect.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
without
--
without
an
intent
to
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
as
i
said,
i
think
so.
in
fact,
i
feel
rather
sure
they
would
because
i
know
of
no
law
that
will
grant
immunity
to
a
person
who
violates
the
law
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
some
police
officers
acquiesce
it
or
gave
him
permission.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
i
know
of
--
as
a
practical
matter,
i'm
ask
--
but
i
know
--
i
know
of
no
statute
given
the
police
officer
authority.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
particular
question
that
you
are
asking
goes
to
the
question
of
intent.
for
example,
if
--
suppose
an
appellate
and
his
followers,
definitely
intended
to
put
a
pressure,
let's
say
political
pressure.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
state
or
all
the
state
officials
are
elected.
they
are
not
appointed
as
you
gentlemen
are.
now,
therefore
it
is
--
you
can
greatly
see
that
there
is
a
greater
need
for
this
sort
of
law
in
the
state
system,
than
that
--
than
that
would
be
in
the
federal
system.
however,
all
of
these
goes
into
the
question
of
intent.
i
think
if
that
was
a
clear
violation
of
the
law,
the
fact
that
this
police
officer
told
them
to
go
ahead
and
do
it,
i
don't
think
that
would
make
any
difference
at
all.
i
think
it
would
be
something
you
would
have
to
throw
into
the
scales
in
weighing
this
element
of
intent.
i
think
it's
--
i
think
it's
a
factor
to
consider.
i
said
they
do
but
i
don't
think
it's
all
controlling.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
i
think
that
--
i
think
they
could
have
been
arrested
clearly
at
the
old
state
capitol
for
blocking
that
sidewalk
before
they
ever
got
to
the
courthouse.
and
as
the
chief
of
police
said,
the
only
reason
he
tolerated
it
was
--
well,
of
course,
i've
just
read
it
from
the
transcript,
he
was
asked
to
disperse
before
he
ever
got
two
blocks
from
the
courthouse,
which
he
refused
do
it.
and
the
only
reason
that
this
tolerance
or
acquiescence
on
the
part
of
public
officials
was
high,
it
was
because
they
were
trying
to
get
out
of
that
situation
as
easy
as
possible.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir.
with
one
modification,
the
consent
would
be
relevant
only
with
reference
to
the
breach
of
the
peace.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
on
the
fact
of
--
well,
they've
ordered
to
dispense
and
disperse
or
not.
i
don't
think
the
officers
could
have
said,
well,
line
up
on
the
sidewalk.
and
then
as
soon
as
they
got
out
there,
say
in
effect,
well
i've
got
you,
and
he
puts
them
under
arrest
because
you
have
locked
him
out
of
the
order
to
disperse.
but
of
course,
you
don't
have
that
situation
into
others
except
with
reference
to
the
question
of
intent.
and
i
think
those
questions
rather
than
bearing
upon
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
violation
or
non-violation
of
this
statute
here
that
we're
discussing
here
today.
i
think
those
issues
bearing
more
on
the
question
of
perhaps
facts
as
to
be
considered
in
sentencing
the
man.
i
think
in
fact
that
it
should
be
considered
by
a
sentencing
judge
other
than
the
relevant
avenues
i
said
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that's
right.
i
think
it
(voice
overlap)
if
some
that
wanted
to
rob
a
store
and
the
police
officer
said,
well,
go
ahead
die
with
me
and
he
got
caught,
he
wouldn't
be
not
guilty
because
of
the
fact
that
the
police
officer
said
he
could
do
it
but
it
may
be
some
sort
of
justification
in
the
sentence
involved.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
all
the
time
justice.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well,
we
don't
use
ropes,
we
have
--
we
have
readily
areas
that
are
constantly
and
it
had
been
historically
used
and
of
course
these
areas
are
barricaded
off
so
that
you
won't
have
any
disorder.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
because
there
was
no
request.
there
was
no
request
for
it,
there
were
no
arrangements,
and
there
were
no
preparations
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that's
correct.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
they
contact
the
mayor
and
he
in
turn
refers
them
to
the
chief
of
police.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
the
first
--
the
first
encounter
of
this
crowd
with
any
police
authority
was
after
they
had
congregated.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
and
at
that
time,
rather
than
consent
authorization
whatever
his
power
is
to
give
or
not,
he
told
them
to
break
it
up.
he
says,
in
effect,
what
is
your
purpose
here
to
protest
the
arrest
of
these
23.
and
they
also
said,
well
this
is
a
matter
for
the
court,
why
don't
you
break
it
up
and
go
from
whence
you
came.
and
this
was
their
first
encounter
with
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
mr.
white
--
wingate
white.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
he
was
the
chief
deputy
sheriff.
that's
correct.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well,
chief
white
was
the
man
who
encountered
them
as
they
were
walking
towards
the
courthouse
and
ask
them
what
they
were
going
to
do
and
asked
them
to
confine
it
on
a
certain
area
and
then
on
second
thoughts,
how
long
is
it
going
to
take,
it
was
seven
minutes
and
it
lasted
longer
by
everybody's
approximation
and
it
got
worst
as
they
went
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that's
correct.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well,
one
difference
would
be
that
of
course
the
jail
would
be
located
on
the
top
floor
in
the
courthouse.
and
they
were
within
shouting
in
a
distance
and
they
were
assembled
103
feet
from
the
steps
of
the
courthouse.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that's
correct.
i
might
say
that
the
trial
court
--
the
trial
judge
was
present
in
court
just
before
this
--
while
this
thing
was
getting
--
was
forming
and
he
left.
he
said
that
he
was
very
fearful
about
what
might
happen.
of
course
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
this
was
a
working
day
and
this
happened
right
at
noon
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
which
case?
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
they
were
--
they
haven't
been
assigned
yet.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
were
never
--
never
formally
arraigned.
as
the
counsel
said,
they're
prescribed.
of
course,
there's
nothing
inconsistent
about
the
legality
or
illegality
of
their
arrest
and
the
fact
that
they
have
never
been
tried.
this
was
--
this
occurred
in
the
christmas
season
or
holiday
and
these
people
go
out
carrying
out
information,
picketed
some
of
the
merchants
who
were
discriminated
and
some
of
the
merchants
call
the
houses
and
they
went
out
and
arrested
the
23.
they
were
never
--
never
formally
charged.
the
trial
judge
had
nothing
to
do
with
whether
they'd
be
charged
or
not.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
they
got
out,
i
don't
know
the
exact
date
your
honor
but
they
got
out
rather
shortly
after.
i'm
sure
the
opposing
counsel
knows.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir,
about
that.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes,
and
this
particular
statute
i
might
say
is
was
adopted
in
1950.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
right
after
the
federal
statute
which
was
adopted
in
49
and
to
cover
the
case
then
involving
judge
medina's
court
in
the
trial
of
10
communists
where
they
had
picketing
and
parading.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
i
understand
that
to
be
one
of
their
arguments.
i
don't
--
as
i
said
i
know
of
no
authority
which
would
empower
an
officer
to
talk
right
--
below
but
i
can't
see
the
relevancy
of
that
issue
on
the
question
of
intent.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
--
probably
on
the
question
of
willful
--
intentionally
or
willfully
if
a
person
or
a
crowd
did
willfully
commit
a
crime
but
these
people
came
down
for
the
violative
and
the
same
purpose
of
protest
in
illegal
arrest
and
they
came
to
the
courthouse
and
i
think
they
necessarily
violated,
the
reason
is
rather
clear.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no
issue
made
of
course
with
reference
to
jeopardy.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well,
i
know
of
no
constitutional
prohibition
against
that
if
you
know,
if
the
conduct
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
it
was
described
against
by
the
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
for
example,
if
a
person
robbed
another
person
and
--
and
stole
some
money
from
him.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
i
don't
see
nothing
objectionable
about
charging
him
with
theft
and
with
--
and
with
robbery.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no
sir,
they're
not
the
same.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
i
mean,
of
course,
robbery
is
theft
from
the
person
of
another
by
the
use
of
force
etcetera.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
or
even
drunk
driving,
dwi,
driving
while
under
influence.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
the
person
can
be
held
dwi
and
also
reckless
driving
and
speed
all
at
the
same
time.
if
that's
provided
factually,
they
come
under
their
respective
law
and
i
think
you
have
that
situation
here.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well,
there's
another
case
involved
with
that
here
--
later
case,
the
south
carolina
case
and
every
one
of
these
cases,
for
example,
edwards.
they've
owned
state
capital
grounds,
a
place
where
they
had
a
right
to
be
and
so
stated
by
this
court.
in
one
of
the
other
cases
they
went
at
the
city
hall
grounds,
a
place
where
they
had
a
right
to
be
as
stated
by
this
court.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
correct,
that
was
so
recognized
in
edwards
by
this
court.
this
court
said,
have
they
been
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir,
that
was
--
it
refers
that
to
you
--
that
this
was
not
as
situation
wherein
these
people
were
charged
with
violating
permissible
hours
where
they
were
authorized
of
being
on
the
premises
etcetera.
but
they
had
a
right
to
be
where
they
were
in
those
cases.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
they
had
no
right
to
be
--
to
congregate
on
the
sidewalks.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
it
says
willful,
normal
use.
this
was
restricted.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
we
have
several,
yes.
we
have
several
parts.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no,
no,
no
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no
sir.
we
--
as
i
said,
we
try
to
operate
under
the
written
laws
and
--
and
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well,
if
you
entertain
the
presumption
that
we
all
know
the
law,
you
would
know
that
you
couldn't
hold
a
demonstration
on
the
sidewalk
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
there
are
many
public
parks
in
baton
rouge.
we
have
a
recreation
park
commission
which
maintains
several
parks
and
public
buildings
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
i'm
sure
there's
one
that
i'm
not
familiar
with
it.
i
couldn't
cite
it
right
often.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
oh!
apart
from
the
courthouse?
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
oh
no,
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
this
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
no
sir,
not
at
all.
this
statute
deals
with
the
courthouse.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
for
the
simple
reason
that
rs
14401
which
prescribes
this
offense,
demonstrated
--
requires
that
it
be
done
picketing
with
the
intent
to
interfere
and
so
on
and
so
forth
be
done
in
or
near
a
building
housing
a
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana
or
in
or
near
a
building
or
residence
occupied
or
used
by
such
judge,
juror,
witness
or
court
official,
i
would
imagine
if
it
probably
could
under
the
court
official
that
it
probably
would
be
a
violation.
and
of
course,
this
is
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
residents?
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well,
we
didn't
specify
any
because
we
have
--
we
have
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
we
have
a
through
e
divisions.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
the
illegal
arrest.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
they're
making
the
protest
obviously
to
everybody
connected
with
the
courthouse.
well,
you
have
five
--
six
courthouse
or
six
courtroom.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
judge
blanche,
the
judge
who
is
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
district
attorney,
the
sheriff
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes,
he's
a
court
officer
in
the
district
attorney's
office,
all
located
in
this
same
building.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
identical
with
the
exception
of
federal
and
state.
it's
identical
and
it
was
copied
in
1950
which
was
pointed
out,
it
was
some
four
years
prior
to
the
topeka
versus
brown.
there
was
a
contention
in
the
lower
court
that
this
was
passed
with
the
view
of
perpetuating
and
maintaining
this
allegation.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
to
me
yes,
that's
exactly
what
its
--
the
object
is
to
have
a
completely,
fine
and
impartial
unhampered
administration
of
justice
and
it
goes
not
only
to
the
court
and
to
judges
but
all
of
the
officials
connected.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
it's
a
compression
and
undoing
or
any
kind
of
influence
except
in
court,
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
and
as
i've
said,
the
officials
in
louisiana
are
all
elected.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well,
of
course,
that
would
be
a
question
of
--
of
fact
to
be
determined.
the
intent
is
a
fact
although
it's
very
seldom
proved
as
such.
as
i
said
from
circumstances,
that's
a
question
of
fact
which
the
court
passes
on.
in
this
case,
it
was
a
question
that
it's
not
only
the
trial
court
but
the
supreme
court
found
to
be
supported
by
the
evidence
if
there
was
ample
evidence
to
show
that
this
element
of
intent
was
proved.
i
think
that
the
fact
that
--
there
are
large
body
of
people
go
over
near
you
like
the
courthouse
where
there's
no
facilities
there
--
no
space,
no
area
to
hold
any
such
meeting.
it
is
rather
significant
thing
in
this
case.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
the
supreme
court
made
--
of
louisiana,
mentioned
that
there
had
been
no
application
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
with
reference
to
these
23
and
there
had
been
no
showing
that
they
had
obtained
bond.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
either
the
district
attorney's
office
or
the
grand
jury.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
he
wouldn't
--
as
a
practical
matter
with
the
district
attorney's
office
--
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
and
of
course
the
judge
who
tried
the
case.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
chief
--
city
authorities.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
the
city
police.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
follow
you.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
well,
i'll
--
of
course
this
--
this
law
requires
only
the
intent
to
influence.
it
doesn't
require
--
it
doesn't
require
that
there
would
be
an
actual
corruption
of
any
public
official.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes,
it
doesn't
require
on
effective
measures
as
actually
influencing
any
judge.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
that's
right.
i
think
there
has
to
be
a
definite
intent
influence.
i
don't
think
it's
the
mere
fact
that
congregating
could
be
a
violation
of
this
law.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
l.
roy
thank
you,
your
honor.
