mr.
nils
douglas
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
argue
the
appeal
of
the
conviction
of
reverend
b.
elton
cox
for
demonstrating
near
a
courthouse.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
the
same
facts
as
the
previous
case.
the
statute
involved
will
be
found
on
page
4(a)
of
the
consolidated
brief
for
the
appellant.
in
essence,
your
honors,
this
statue
prevents
intentional
picketing
--
parading
or
picketing
with
the
specific
intent
to
either
influence
a
judge
or
obstruct
justice.
mr.
nils
douglas
except
that
the
federal
statute
protects
federal
courts,
and
our
statute
protects
state
courts.
mr.
nils
douglas
exactly,
yes.
my
argument
consists
of
three
points.
the
first
point
is
that
there
was
no
clear
and
present
danger
requiring
the
conviction
of
the
appellant
in
this
case.
the
second
point
is
that
neither
one
of
the
state
courts
which
passed
on
this
action
applied
the
clear
and
present
danger
rule.
and
the
third
portion
of
my
argument
is
that
there
was
no
evidence
upon
which
to
convict
the
appellant
herein.
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
a
clear
and
present
danger
in
this
instance,
we
must
look
to
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
what
was
said
and
done
on
the
one
hand
and
what
was
not
said
and
done
on
the
other
hand.
you
must
look
to
the
purposes
of
this
demonstration.
the
demonstration
was
held
to
protest
the
previous
day's
illegal
arrest
of
the
23
negro
students.
i
might
add
at
this
point,
your
honors
that
nothing
has
happened
to
these
students
since
they
were
arrested.
in
other
words,
at
the
time
on
the
december
15th
demonstration,
they
were
in
jail.
they
had
been
booked.
they
were
not
formally
charged.
they
were
never
arraigned.
they
were
released
on
bond.
and
the
statute
of
limitations
has
now
run
on
the
picketing
which
prompted
the
demonstrations
for
which
the
appellant
was
arrested.
the
reasonable
implication
being
that
since
this
is
the
case
there
were
some
reasonable
grounds
for
the
demonstration
against
the
arrest
of
these
people.
mr.
nils
douglas
not
in
view
of
the
fact
that
--
mr.
nils
douglas
not
in
view
of
the
fact,
if
your
honor
will,
as
our
people
were
convicted
in
this
case.
mr.
nils
douglas
don't
really
know,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
say
that
--
we
can't
say
that
the
songs
that
were
sung,
the
prayers
that
were
had,
influenced
the
judge
or
obstruct
the
justice.
we
must
look
to
the
speech.
what
did
cox
say
or
what
didn't
he
say?
he
admonished
the
people
against
violence.
in
fact,
he
told
them
that
if
he
was
vowed
upon
to
forget
it,
if
--
if
he
were
hit,
to
turn
the
other
cheek.
in
addition
to
that,
just
about
12
o'clock,
he
told
the
people
as
was
previously
said
that,
“it's
12
o'clock,
if
you're
hungry
go
downtown
and
sit
in
until
you
were
served.”
it
was
just
at
this
point
that
a
number
of
things
happened
in
my
interpretation
of
the
facts
almost
simultaneously.
the
sheriff
told
them
to
move
on
and
the
testimony
is
conflicting
as
to
whether
or
not
cox
did
say,
“don't
move”
or
whether
he
said,
“don't
run”.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
has
testimony
to
the
effect
that
two
orders
were
given.
first,
the
sheriff
told
them
to
move
on
and
as
some
policemen
were
--
made
physical
contact
with
the
people,
they
were
told
“wait
a
minute”
and
then
a
second
order
was
given.
now,
the
state
would
have
us
believe
that
there
was
a
deliberate
order
“move
on”
and
then
another
clear
cut
order
“move
on
again”.
but
i
submit
and
on
the
basis
of
what
i've
suggested
that
there
was
a
conflicting
order.
and
of
course
this
has
been
bypassed
largely
in
the
handling
of
the
matter
at
the
trial
court
and
at
the
state
supreme
court
level.
mr.
nils
douglas
it
is
contradicted.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
nils
douglas
yes.
not
at
the
very
moment
of
the
testimony
wherein
this
statement
is
made,
but
by
the
testimony
of
other
people.
mr.
nils
douglas
our
--
our
position,
our
primary
position,
i
believe,
with
reference
to
all
three
of
the
cases,
your
honor
is
that
there
was
no
clear
and
present
danger
that
this
was
a
permissible
exercise
of
free
speech
and
with
--
particularly
with
reference
to
disturbing
the
peace
statute
that
the
statute
itself
is
so
vague,
it
build
that
information
which
is
--
which
track
--
tracks
it
is
also
vague.
and
therefore,
the
--
the
question
of
whether
he
said
“move”
or
“not
move”
doesn't
have
major
importance.
mr.
nils
douglas
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
nils
douglas
in
every
essence,
your
honor,
it's
often
--
mr.
nils
douglas
it's
our
position,
your
honor,
that
in
every
instance
where
free
speech
is
being
exercised
that
it
must
be
shown
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
there
was
clear
and
present
danger
and
of
course
this
implies
that
--
mr.
nils
douglas
to
a
substantial
interest
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
protect.
this
seems
to
be
modeling
off
a
cliché,
but
this
is
about
the
best
that
i
can
do.
i
can
improve
upon
the
court's
definition
though.
but
implied
in
what
you're
saying
is
that
there
are
certain
priorities
with
reference
to
the
right
the
state
has
to
protect
as
against
the
right
of
free
speech.
and
implicit
in
my
argument
is
that
free
speech
has
a
third
position,
and
of
course
with
reference
to
the
grass,
the
--
the
presumption
would
be
in
favor,
the
use
of
free
speech.
mr.
nils
douglas
that's
right,
your
honor.
an
implicit,
i
imagine
in
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
state,
of
course,
has
the
right
to
protect
its
judiciary
and
the
administration
of
justice.
and
we
submit,
that
the
presumption
there
is
that
the
basic
presumption
historically
has
been
that
the
courts
will
render
justice
in
spite
of
the
influences
on
the
outside.
and
of
course,
the
line
too
has
to
be
drawn,
but
we
say
that
under
the
circumstances
here
this
does
not
--
in
fact,
the
judge
was
not
influenced.
in
fact,
there
was
no
obstructing
of
justice.
mr.
nils
douglas
no,
i
know
--
mr.
nils
douglas
there
--
there
are
circumstances,
your
honor,
where
people
could
demonstrate
here
or
near
other
courts
where
the
right
would
not
be
protected.
but
the
point
that
i'm
making
is
that
it
has
to
be
determined
on
a
case
by
case
basis
and
--
mr.
nils
douglas
what
we're
saying
here,
your
honor,
if
i
may
interrupt,
is
that
the
conduct
was
speech.
the
conduct
was
so
intertwined
with
the
speech
that
what
was
said
and
what
wasn't
said
are
all
pointed
irretrievably
to
the
notion
that
they
had
no
intention
at
all
of
going
to
the
court.
they
didn't
say
judge
blanch
was
going
to
do
this.
they
didn't
know
--
mr.
nils
douglas
the
streets
are
the
proper
place
to
have
a
demonstration,
your
honor.
mr.
nils
douglas
yes.
mr.
nils
douglas
the
state
can
prohibit
it
if
it
so
chose,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
in
free
speech
--
mr.
nils
douglas
well,
we
don't
deny,
your
honor
that
--
that
the
legislature
has
a
wide
discretion
and
whether
what
--
what
it
will
prohibit.
but
what
we
suggest
is
that
the
courts
don't,
with
due
regard
to
free
speech,
give
the
same
interpretation
to
the
statutes
that
the
constitution
requires
that
it
should.
in
other
words,
this
statute,
we
say,
prohibits
free
speech.
the
state
cannot
prohibit
it.
mr.
nils
douglas
and
this
statute
could've
been
--
mr.
nils
douglas
the
state
has
a
right
to
make
a
legislative
determination
that
here,
if
people
demonstrate
near
a
courtroom,
this
is
sufficient
to
put
them
in
jail.
mr.
nils
douglas
i'm
--
i'm
afraid
i
--
i
missed,
your
honor's
point,
but
the
--
the
point
that
i
was
attempting
to
make
is
that
this
statute
prohibits
free
speech.
this
says
--
mr.
nils
douglas
well,
there's
--
there's
no
order
--
mr.
nils
douglas
--
necessary
--
mr.
nils
douglas
yes.
mr.
nils
douglas
the
statute
can
be
saved,
your
honor.
the
trial
judge
if
he
had
applied
the
clear
and
present
danger
rule
then
the
state
supreme
court
could've
saved
the
statute.
we're
not
complaining
about
the
statute,
we're
complaining
about
the
application
of
the
statute.
mr.
nils
douglas
but
the
--
the
basic
approach
that
we've
attempted
to
use
with
this
is
to
say
that
when
a
state
incorporates
as
the
--
the
state's
brief
implies,
incorporates
the
clear
and
present
danger.
here
is
the
situation
where
it
can
be
used
very
easily
and
arbitrarily
to
subvert
any
unpopular
opinions.
and
we're
saying
that
this
is
what
has
happened
here.
cox
was
a
negro,
there
are
2000
negroes
out
there.
negroes
have
never
acted
like
this
before.
mr.
nils
douglas
well,
if
they
had
been
white
then
you
--
you
change
the
crucial
face
of
--
of
the
factual
situation.
i
--
i
would
assume
that
you
would
have
to
also
assume
that
this
guy
said
something
that
apart
of
the
white
community
it
didn't
go
along
with
it.
and
--
and
he
was
therefore
told
to
move
not
by
virtue
of
his
being
there
but
by
virtue
of
place
as
something
against
the
catholic
or
something
against
the
jew.
so
the
--
the
point
of
all
that
i've
been
rather
weakly
suggesting
is
that
here
is
the
statute
which
is
very
broad
statute
which
actually
prohibits
congregating
as
--
as
has
been
suggested.
but
we
say
that
the
activities
of
our
people
were
pure
speech
activities
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
are
some
physical
elements
of
being
present.
the
facts
--
mr.
nils
douglas
well
it
is
pure
speech
--
mr.
nils
douglas
what
--
what
i'm
attempting
to
do
is
to
distinguish
between
the
picketing
situation
in
this
situation
because
there
was
no
intent
at
all
to
violate
the
prohibition
to
the
statute.
the
purpose
of
the
meeting
was
to
protest
the
previous
arrest
to
protest
generally
segregation
and
discrimination.
and
we
can't
lose
aside
of
the
fact
that
the
--
the
december
14th
arrest
involved
discrimination.
the
december
15
arrest
involved
advocacy
of
integration.
both
groups
of
people
were
put
in
a
segregated
jail.
both
--
cox
was
tried
in
a
segregated
courtroom.
the
issue
of
the
segregated
courtroom
was
raised.
the
implication
in
the
words
of
the
trial
judge
is
that,
“if
you
bring
2000
negroes
down
here
anytime
no
matter
what
you
do,
even
if
you're
not
near
the
courthouse,
you've
broken
some
law.”
it's
as
general
as
that,
and
the
implication
is
--
mr.
nils
douglas
but
the
--
mr.
nils
douglas
maybe
i
can
attempt
to
accommodate
the
suggestion
by
saying
that
implicit
in
the
whole
series
of
events
is
a
notion
that
we
had
a
right
to
be
there.
certainly,
these
people
put
the
state
on
notice
the
day
before.
the
state
knew.
the
record
bears
this
out
and
this
is
why
they
had
70
city
policemen
plus
the
state
troopers
and
deputy
sheriffs
who
were
all
present.
they
knew
and
certainly
if
these
people
had
intended
to
march
on
the
jails,
they
wouldn't
have
put
the
state
on
notice
that
this
is
what
they
were
going
to
do.
but
the
point
of
the
matter
is
the
fact
that
they
were
there
and
the
fact
that
they
stayed
there
is
all
because
they
felt
that
this
was
a
street,
this
was
a
public
area
and
we
had
a
perfect
right
to
be
there.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
nils
douglas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
nils
douglas
may
it
please
the
court.
we
also
would
like
to
apologize
for
the
old
site
with
reference
to
mr.
roy
not
receiving
a
copy.
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
attorney
general,
the
state
received
a
copy
of
our
brief
now.
mr.
nils
douglas
if
this
were
a
case
of
the
evenhanded
administration
of
justice,
many
of
the
issues
raised
here
would
not
be
as
perplexing
as
they
are.
however,
our
basic
position
is
that
the
streets
and
sidewalks
are
natural
places
for
people
to
express
their
views
and
if
they
have
no
less
right
to
express
the
view
of
anti-segregation,
then
they
have
a
right
to
express
the
views
on
anything
else.
much
has
been
made
of
the
fact
that
the
activities
took
on
an
aspect
of
picketing.
i
might
suggest
that
there
were
other
areas
of
the
demonstration
which
took
off
the
aspect
--
a
greater
aspect
of
free
speech,
the
pledging
allegiance
to
the
flag.
this
would
suggest
a
support
of
the
government
rather
than
an
attempt
to
destruct.
the
singing
a
patriotic
songs,
likewise,
the
singing
of
religious
songs
would
seem
to
me
to
suggest
that
this
was
to
be
nonviolent.
the
fact
that
the
previous
date,
the
police
knew,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
and
the
testimony
of
ronnie
moore
on
behalf
of
the
defense,
states
that
when
the
students
were
leaving
southern
university,
the
negro
bus
drivers
were
arrested
so
that
the
negroes
would
not
get
to
town.
the
students,
when
the
bus
drivers
were
arrested,
got
out
and
walked
to
four
or
five
miles
to
town,
which
is
the
reason
why
the
demonstration
took
place
around
12
o'clock.
this
is
free
speech,
nothing
more,
nothing
less
what
did
the
picket
signs
say?
the
picket
signs
didn't
say
judge
blanche.
judge
blanche
might
have
had
a
subjective
intent
or
judge
blanche
might
have
had
a
subject
to
feeling
that
he
was
intimidated
but
this
is
not
the
test,
the
test
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
danger
to
the
obstruction
of
justice
is
an
objective
test.
individually,
judge
blanche
might
have
been
with
all
due
respect,
it's
a
little
more
timid
than
the
reasonable
judge
who
happens
to
be
in
a
courthouse
before
a
demonstration
in
protest
of
segregation.
not
only
were
there
city
police
present,
the
men
were
taken
off
leave
and
put
on
duty.
this
was
supplanted
--
this
was
supplemented
by
deputy
sheriffs,
by
the
state
police
by
afar.
the
meeting
wasn't
stopped
because
the
time
was
up.
the
mention
on
the
time
was
just
incidental.
the
testimony
of
the
two
chief
representatives
of
the
state,
the
chief
of
police
and
the
criminal
sheriff,
they
were
there,
they
approved,
they
directed,
they
saw
the
signs,
they
heard
the
songs,
it
was
all
right
for
negroes
to
be
down
there
only
because
as
one
of
them
testified,
it
was
already
an
accomplished
plot.
but
hadn't
been
an
accomplished
plot
and
hadn't
the
students
walk
from
scotlandville,
they
would
have
prevented
it.
the
demonstration
was
alright
to
testify
until
cox
said,
let's
sit
in.
this
is
wrong,
this
is
a
negro,
this
is
baton
rouge,
this
is
assault.
we
are
not
to
disprove
of
illegal
activities,
illegal
arrests,
illegal
laws,
illegal
feet-dragging,
judicial
feet-dragging.
the
sheriff
and
some
of
the
witnesses
testified
that
there
was
tenseness
in
the
surroundings
immediately
before
the
teargas
was
thrown.
we
suggest
that
tenseness
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
create
a
clear
and
present
danger.
we
suggest
that
these
--
all
the
indicia,
all
the
facts,
this
demonstration
was
a
peaceful
one,
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
people
were
going
to
storm
the
jails.
with
reference
to
the
specific
intent
in
the
state's
brief
on
page
19,
the
state
may
express
mention
on
the
fact
that
they
placed
particular
emphasis
on
the
size
of
the
group,
on
the
fact
that
these
people
said
that
they
were
there
to
protest
the
illegal
arrest
as
if
there
was
no
right
to
protest
illegal
arrest,
the
fact
that
it
was
near
the
courthouse
and
the
fact
that
there
was
shouting
and
yelling.
it
took
these
four
items
to
be
sufficient
facts
from
which
it
could
infer
the
specific
intent
to
obstruct
justice
and
to
influence
the
judge.
i
suggest
that
this
is
not
sufficient
evidence.
this
is
no
evidence
upon
which
to
impute
to
a
man
a
crime
as
serious
as
obstructing
justice
and
influencing
the
judge.
i
think
it's
entirely
illegal
unconstitutional
and
immoral
to
sentence
a
man
to
one
year
in
jail
and
$5000
because
they
were
shouting
and
yelling.
mr.
nils
douglas
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
didn't
handle
the
matter
at
the
trial
level.
mr.
nils
douglas
the
--
do
i
understand
your
honor
to
say
that
if
there's
a
statute
which
merely
prohibits
the
act
of
being
present
in
a
group
picketing
near
the
courthouse?
mr.
nils
douglas
of
conviction?
mr.
nils
douglas
a
conviction
under
that
statute,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
nils
douglas
i
say
a
conviction
under
that
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
nils
douglas
i'm
afraid
we
have
but
no
your
honor.
