justice

certainly
the
--
in
affirming
the
convictions,
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
was
very
explicit
in
finding
that
he
had
been
ordered
to
move
on
and
had
not
only
refused
to
do
so,
but
had
told
the
other
people
don't
move.
that's
true
in
the
opinions
on
both
of
these
cases,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
referring
to
this
case
at
pages
19
(a)
and
to
37
(a).
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
you
position
that
in
order
for
any
law
which
in
any
way
impedes
or
regulates
or
limits
the
time
when
first
amendment
rights
can
be
exercised
that
the
--
that
only
--
that
such
a
law
is
valid
only
when
there's
a
--
when
there
can
be
shown
a
clear
and
present
danger?
i'm
thinking
for
example
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
let
me
be
specific.
let's
just
say
there's
a
--
there's
a
“keep
off
the
grass,”
the
“keep
of
the
grass”
ordinance
and
people
insist
on
congregating
there
to
--
to
assemble
and
--
and
express
their
ideas.
and
is
it
your
--
is
it
your
contention
that
there
has
to
be
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
only
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
damage
to
the
grass?
that's
a
limited
specific
ordinance
with
a
précised
purpose.
and
is
it
your
contention
that
such
an
ordinance
would
be
entirely
invalid
unless
you
can
show
a
clear
and
present
danger
that
sounds
like
safety?
justice
potter
stewart
to
what--
to
what?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
was
my
suggestion
that
the
growth
of
the
grass
isn't
probably
very
important,
but
on
the
other
hand,
it's
a
very
specific
kind
of
an
ordinance,
my
imaginary
ordinance,
with
a
very
specific
purpose,
and
--
and
you
say
that
no
--
no
conviction
could
be
sustained
under
my
kind
of
a
case
where
people
insisted
on
violating
that
ordinance
and
standing
on
the
lawn
where
there
was
a
valid
“keep
off
the
grass”
sign,
unless
they
could
show
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
public
safety,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
the
officer's
pledge
when
he
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
a
jail.
i
could
understand
that
statute
which
talked
about
assembling
around
a
jail
would
obvious
--
quite
obviously
be
directed
at
a
lynch
mob
or
something
like
that.
but
although
the
jail
happens
to
be
here
in
the
courthouse,
the
statute
isn't
directed
to
them
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
grouped
around
the
jail
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
roy,
earlier
in
your
argument,
mr.
justice
black
raised
this
question.
these
people
were
--
this
man
for
one
course
of
conduct
was
convicted
of
three
distinct
and
separate
offenses
and
sentenced
to
three
distinct
punishments
accumulatively
imposed
as
any
claim
had
been
made
during
the
course
of
these
proceedings
that
this
was
constitutionally
offensive?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
really
a
matter
of
double
jeopardy.
it's
a
matter
of
convicting
them
of
three
separate
and
distinct
defenses
for
actually
one
course
of
conduct.
justice
potter
stewart
for
obstructing
a
sidewalk
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
breaching
to
peace
and
for
demonstrating
around
the
jail.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
with
theft
and
with
robbery,
they're
the
same
thing.
justice
potter
stewart
in
your
state,
they're
not.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
