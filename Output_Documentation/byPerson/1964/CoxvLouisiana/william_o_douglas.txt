mr.
roy,
i
didn't
understand
you.
justice
william
o.
douglas
when
was
the
release?
justice
william
o.
douglas
shortly
after
the
demonstration?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
your
point
simply
is
that
you
have
a
sense
of
statute
here
in
reference
to
the
courthouse
in
its
environment
particularly
over
the
sidewalks
and
other
things
around
the
courthouse
and
you
say
that
this
specifically
shows
a
violation
of
that
specific
statute.
justice
william
o.
douglas
right
after
(voice
overlap)
--?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
if
they
assembled
to
see
the
president
comes
into
the
building
that
would
not
be
an
offense
--
a
violation?
