do
you
think
that
the
meeting
with
the
sheriff
about
how
long
they'd
be
permitted
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
was
the
reference?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
a
dispute
as
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
am
i
wrong,
i
thought
the
state's
position
was
that
--
they
told
they
could
have
seven
minutes
and
when
that
--
the
sheriff,
when
the
--
he
told
them
to
move
but
he
told
them
first,
the
seven
minutes
had
run
out,
is
that
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
correct.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
reading
--
is
this
a
--
in
your
appendix,
are
you
reading
from
a
supreme
court's
opinion
that
--
that's
in
--
what
page
is
that
in,
24
or
49?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
opinion
in
the
other
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
same
judge
--
on
page
37
(a)
the
--
that
district
judge
said
the
sheriff,
something
that
serious
that
(inaudible)
the
situation.
that
means,
he
allowed
the
people
who
are
in
the
demonstration
to
“move
on”.
cox
on
the
--
however,
cox
openly
defied
this
command
then
continued
the
firing
and
frenzied
demonstration
because
they
were
still
being
joined
by
23
people
in
the
front
--
who
were
in
the
building
despite
a
second
admonition
by
the
sheriff.
now
does
the
record
support
that
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
there's
a
difference?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
had
been
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
but
that
--
that
may
not
be
the
whole
record
what
the
sheriff
said
that
--
i
mean,
is
there
any
support
in
the
record
for
this
statement?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
by
looking
at
the
transcript
in
the
record,
a
witness
called
rush
biossat
who
worked
for
the
madison
chemical
corporation
testified,
page
54
of
the
record
and
did
they
--
did
--
and
the
question,
“did
they
so
dispersed?”
he
said,
“they
did
not.
rev.
cox
threw
up
his
arms
and
said
don't
move.”
justice
byron
r.
white
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
about
that
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
biossat,
rush
biossat
--
justice
byron
r.
white
upon
which
--
sounds
like
a
common
stateside
appeal
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
case,
but
the
--
and
there's
another
witness
who
testified
primarily
to
the
same
effect.
is
this
the
kind
of
the
testimony
you're
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
were
there
different
reasons
when
we
take
the
demonstration
was
successful?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
heard
or
moved
without
charging?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
were
they
held
at
the
demonstration?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
wasn't
filed
in
the
trial
court
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
what
page
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
did
you
say
that
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
page
did
you
say
that
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
roy,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
please?
justice
byron
r.
white
assuming
that
the
jail
was
separate
from
the
courthouse
in
your
city
and
the
same
incident
had
occurred,
the
same
series
of
incidents
had
occurred
around
the
jail
with
a
separate
building
and
the
people
assembled
as
they
did
here
to
protest
the
arrest.
would
you
say
that
this
statute
on
the
obstruction
of
justice
has
been
violated?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
incident
had
occurred
around
the
jail
wholly
apart
from
the
courthouse?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
there's
a
jail
located
20
blocks
from
the
courthouse
and
this
was
(voice
overlap)
building.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
same
people
assembled
and
did
exactly
the
same
thing.
would
there
be
a
violation
of
this
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
how
can
you
say,
well
--
well
--
why
wouldn't
it
be
a
violation
under
the
--
if
the
demonstration
had
occurred
around
the
separate
jail?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
wonder
because
you
know
this
isn't
a
courthouse
that
the
statute
covers
i
guess.
it
covers
any
building
occupied
by
a
court
officer.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
who
is
your
court
officer
here
that
you
say
these
people
had
the
intent
of
influencing?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
do
you
think
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
came
down
to
protest
the
arrest
--
to
protest
the
arrest.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
just
said
that
they
will
protest
some
of
this
arrest
whether
these
arrests
were
illegal
or
they're
going
to
protest
them
anyway.
to
whom
are
they
protest
--
making
this
protest?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
would
be
the
effective
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
judges
could
order
the
release
of
these
people.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
the
sheriff,
a
court
officer
under
this
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
would
you
say
the
statute
was
violated?
let's
assume
that
there
haven't
been
any
arrest
at
all
that
these
people
--
these
people
were
assembled
or
just
wanted
to
have
a
demonstration.
their
general
intention
was
to
publicize
the
desegregation
of
restaurants
or
other
institutions.
so
they
have
picked
up
the
courthouse
as
the
place
to
assemble
and
they
assembled
there
and
singing
a
few
songs
on
their
way.
it
was
just
the
--
is
that
kind
of
a
remote
intent
certainly
--
certainly
or
probably
intended
to
influence
the
judges
and
the
other
people
in
the
courthouse
like
they
did
intend
to
influence
the
rest
of
the
community.
is
that
a
violation
of
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
had
there
been
any
writ
of
habeas
corpus
for
these
people?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
makes
--
who
makes
the
decision
in
baton
rouge
as
to
whether
a
charge
is
going
to
be
filed
or
where
do
these
people
are
going
to
be
arraigned.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
grand
jury.
so
a
judge
at
this
point
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
but
did
the
sheriff
have
something
to
do
with
it?
he
have
just
arrested
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
protest
was
going
to
effective
on
what
suppose
to
be
--
would
be
aimed
to
the
district
attorney.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
the
case
--
the
case
wasn't
set
for
trial.
it
wasn't
being
tried,
nobody
knew
whether
it
would
be
tried
or
not.
so
it's
the
district
attorney
that
was
the
effective
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
--
and
his
office
is
also
in
the
courthouse?
