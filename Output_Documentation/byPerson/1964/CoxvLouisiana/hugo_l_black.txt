justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
citing
this
to
point
out
an
error
as
to
the
time
he
consummated
the
statement
or
an
error
as
to
saying
that
he
made
the
statement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
would
that
make
any
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
were
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
right
do
you
say
this
court
granted
under
garner,
i
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
you
say
that
this
court
held
in
garner
that
he
had
a
constitutional
right
to
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
state
tried
to
prohibit
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
still
--
is
your
argument
here
--
what
we
--
submit
here
based
on
the
premise
that
a
state
is
without
power
to
prohibit
people
from
sitting
in,
in
a
store
if
the
storeowner
doesn't
want
them
to
be
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not
an
--
that's
--
i
didn't
think
it
was
but
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
cox
had
said
to
the
crowd
of
2000,
“i
want
you
to
go
down
immediately
and
sit-in
for
two
hours
in
a
number
of
stores”,
would
you
say
that
was
or
was
not
constitutionally
protected
on
his
part?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
not
basing
this
defense
on
that
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
based
on
the
premise
that
the
city
is
without
power
and
the
state
is
without
power
to
bar
2000
people
from
being
next
to
the
courthouse
if
it
does
so
by
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
the
--
it's
not
based
on
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it's
not
based
on
this
principle.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
of
the
two
statutes
that
you
put
out
on
page
7
in
your
brief
was
he
convicted
a
violation,
or
was
it
both?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
the
100.3
do
you
quote
it,
disturbing
the
peace
by
crowding
congregating
with
others.
is
that
one
of
the
two
which
he's
convicted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you're
standing
on
that
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
actual
disturbance
do
you
think
--
you
claim
(inaudible)
under
that
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
says,
disturbing
the
peace
by
crowding
or
congregating
with
others
with
the
intent
to
provoke
a
breach
of
the
peace
under
circumstances
such
for
the
breach
of
the
peace
may
be
occasioned
on
public
streets
or
public
sidewalk
and
who
fails
or
refuses
to
disperse
and
move
on
in
order
to
do
so
by
any
law
enforcement
officer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
are
you
relying
on
the
part,
is
this
an
essential
part
of
it,
you
fail
or
refuse
it
to
disperse
and
move
on
in
order
to
do
so?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
an
essential?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
seems
to
me
rather
to
be
keen
here
aside
from
any
constitutional
purposes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
charge
you
convicted
him
of,
under
this
section
that
he
failed
to
move
on
in
order
to
do
so?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
is
the
failure
to
move
on
and
not
what
he
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
are
you
claiming
that
he
could
be
convicted
for
what
he
said
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
alone?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
a
lawful
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he's
convicted
under
one
of
the
statute
for
saying
that
to
them,
for
saying
that
alone?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
kind
of
court
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
the
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
requires
to
make
the
findings
of
fact?
justice
hugo
l.
black
like
a
jury
verdict,
plea
of
the
guilty
or
not
guilty
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
whatever
it
is
--
what
they
did
was
to
find
him
guilty
and
i
suppose
we
have
to
look
at
that
in
the
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
under
this
statute,
you
could
not
convict
at
all
unless
amongst
--
among
these
charges,
these
things,
congregating
and
so
forth,
he
failed
or
refused
to
disperse
and
move
on
when
ordered
to
do
so.
there's
end
connected
to
that.
it
seems
me
like
that
statute
means
that
that
is
an
essential
thing
and
without
that
he
could
not
be
convicted
under
that
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
challenge
to
the
conviction
--
well,
is
that
concern
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
to
support
that
charge
--
that
trial
which
i
would
suppose
to
be
a
finding
by
finding
him
guilty
if
that's
an
essential
part
of
the
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there's
no
way
to
support
that
finding
by
the
--
of
guilt
from
that
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
--
you
haven't
given
us
--
cited
or
quoted
any
parts
of
the
record,
have
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
a
copy
of
the
transcript
available
to
you
aside
the
one
that's
here
in
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
without
time,
too
much
time,
take
from
that
record
the
part
what
you
say
that
can
justify
a
holding
that
he
failed
or
refused
to
disperse
and
move
on,
in
order
to
do
so?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
would
it
take
you?
does
it
take
very
long?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
long,
that's
an
issue
raised
here.
of
course
if
there's
no
anything
to
show
that
on
our
cases,
quite
a
number
of
them,
the
judgment
couldn't
stand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
recognize
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
april
20?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
that?
now
that
--
that
raises
quite
a
different
proposition.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
concede
then
do
you
that
there
was
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
don't
mean
crucial
evidence
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
which
your
fact
finally
could
have
reached
the
conclusion
that
this
man
failed
to
move
on
when
he
was
ordered
to
do
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
but
we
had
--
we
have
to
go
on
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
on
what
the
judge
said.
frequently
judges
would
give
--
as
you
know,
a
different
reason
in
the
kinds
of
(inaudible)
in
this
case
to
that
kind,
and
they're
not
required
to
make
any
findings
at
all,
are
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
except
that
if
you're
guilty
or
innocent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
if
the
record
shows
that
he
failed
to
move
on,
there's
some
evidence
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
there
is
some
evidence,
we
have
to
accept
the
finding
of
guilty
as
having
found
that
he
failed
to
move
on,
don't
we?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
haven't
thought
about
clear
and
present
danger,
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
impression,
but
the
--
that
was
an
alluding
phrase
as
far
as
i'm
concerned.
but
taking
it
for
whatever
it
is,
the
issue
on
this
thought
whether
there's
evidence
suggested
by
conviction
on
the
basis
that
he
was
asked
to
move
on
when
they
were
gathered
there
together
and
they
failed
to
do
so,
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
aside
from
constitutional
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
--
i
understand
that
argument
in
connection
to
speech.
you're
talking
now
about
conduct
that
needs
to
gather
together
on
the
streets
which
are
under
the
control
of
the
city
and
the
state,
and
i
think
we've
said
--
held
a
number
of
times
that
they
have
considerable
power
to
keep
those
streets
free
from
any
obstructions
or
--
the
basic
purpose
is
to
use
them
to
move
around
though,
and
not
to
create
barred
blocks
of
traffic.
what
is
in
--
it
is
your
argument
that
--
your
constitutional
argument
that
the
state
has
no
right
to
prevent
people
from
blocking
the
street
if
it
wants
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that
is
--
the
state
statute
would
govern
this
permitted
meeting
under
these
circumstances
but
added
to
it
that
if
under
these
circumstances
they
fail
or
refuse
to
disperse
and
move
on
in
order
to
do
so,
then
they're
violating
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
do
you
agree
--
(inaudible)
as
an
ambiguity
of
this
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
taking
it
up
on
its
language?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
regard
in
the
motion
of
the
--
statements
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
why
do
you
think
it
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
say
you
point
it
out,
didn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
afraid
i
exceeded
it
for
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
drawing
a
distinction
between
the
right
to
speak,
talk,
where
you
have
a
right
to
be
and
where
you
do
not
have
a
right
to
be.
did
you
say
that
the
man
has
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
walk
in
here
now
and
it
has
to
be
--
man
has
the
right,
constitutional
right
to
come
in
here,
talk
now,
and
had
nothing
to
be
done
as
a
group
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
2000
--
2000
people?
is
it
your
position
that
if
5000
people
should
gather
out
in
front
of
this
court
that
indicates
they
didn't
like
it?
some
knows
that
constitution
says
that
they've
got
a
right
to
stay
there
and
sing
or
dance
or
do
anything
else
they
want
to
do
so
long
as
they
don't
go
hurt
somebody?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
agree
with
you
about
the
speech,
but
there's
a
difference
between
speech
and
conduct
movement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
didn't
intend
to
go
on
to
court,
they
were
on
the
streets.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they,
if
--
if
the
state
wants
to
prohibit
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
get
it,
they
did
have
a
statute
which
as
i
understand
it
is
the
same
as
we
have
that
would
bar
5000
people
from
some
sections
--
any
section
coming
out
there
and
raving
and
moving
around
and
singing
and
howling
over
our
--
over
the
--
just
because
they
didn't
like
what
the
court
has
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
does
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
it
prohibit
it?
it
prohibits
them
from
being
there,
they
may
have
a
right
to
prohibit
them
for
being
there.
and
if
they
have
a
right
to
prohibiting
them
from
being
there,
certainly
they
can't
say
the
constitution
just
have
the
right
to
come
to
any
house
and
speak.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
if
they
were
to
demonstrate
in
different
speech,
you
have
--
what
do
you
do
when
the
statute
that
had
said
that
in
those
instance
where
the
conduct
is
regulated
which
may
be
intertwined
with
speech,
it
can
be
regulated
in
a
narrow
--
in
a
--
such
a
narrowly
drawn,
precisely
vivid
to
prohibit
them
doing
that
which
the
state
prohibits.
that's
quite
different
to
the
--
to
the
way
you
have
utilized
that
today,
as
i
understand,
the
idea
of
clear
and
present
danger.
it's
ignored
the
fact
that
--
for
my
judgment
that
--
that
a
man
doesn't
have
a
right
to
say
what
he
wants
to
at
a
place
where
he
doesn't
have
any
right
to
be.
so
you
get
back
to
the
question
of
whether
you
prevent
them
being
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
prohibits
assembly
unless
and
saying
that
after
an
order
with
hundreds
of
people
there
on
the
street
that
--
here
at
the
courthouse.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
not
this
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
other
one
was
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
is
around
the
courthouse.
is
it
your
view
that
the
statute
that
governs
this
court
that
people
out
in
front
of
the
court
is
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
complaining
about
it
being
applied
to
people
who
do
what
you
said
shall
not
be
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
it
been
white,
they've
been
in
the
door?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
could've
been
purely
speech,
couldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
question
of
being
there
and
moving
around
and
so
forth
if
they
don't
got
a
right
to
be
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
statute
--
the
statute
is
not
that
though.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
tell
you
this
because
you
probably
will
not
come
to
this.
i'd
like
you
to
consider
from
this
viewpoint.
there
is
a
difference
between
speech,
regulated
speech
and
regulated
conduct,
regulating
where
people
can
be
and
what
they
should
say
where
they
have
a
right
to
be.
some
people
think,
i'm
one
of
them,
that
they've
got
a
right
to
be
somewhere.
they've
got
a
right
to
say
what
they
want
to
say,
but
if
you
got
to
perceive
whether
they
have
the
right
to
be
there.
you
have
one
thing
if
you
haven't
presented
at
all
and
that
is
this.
that
even
in
regulating
the
conduct
of
people
by
speeches
and
it
kindly,
this
court
has
said
that
there
must
be
some
showing
of
governmental
interest
sufficient
to
justify
must
be
--
must
be
here.
that's
quite
different
from
the
way
you've
presented.
and
i'm
not
saying
about
the
way
you
presented
it
because
it's
confusing
accustomed
to
find
the
most
people
perhaps
involved
but
that
what
bothers
me
about
your
argument
is
that
you've
drawn
no
distinction
between
marching
around
and
around
for
instance
at
a
prayer.
regulating
that
and
regulating
what
people
say
where
they
have
a
perfect
right
to
be
there.
you
get
back
to
the
present,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
of
whether
they
have
a
right
to
be
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
consolidated
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
have
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
hope
that
before
you
finish
asking,
you
finish
this
line
before
you
sit
down,
you
will
discuss
--
i
don't
know
whether
they
raised
it
or
not,
but
it's
raised
in
my
mind
whether
he
could
be
convicted
twice
for
the
--
under
the
same
circumstances
with
--
was
he
convicted
actually
twice
for
the
same
thing
because
i
don't
care
if
you'd
discuss
it
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
like
to
hear
what
you
say
about
it
if
it
was
raised
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
ask
you
if
you
are
arguing
the
second
case
on
this
basis.
assuming
that
there
are
2500
people
in
that
last
night
somewhere
close
by
and
decided
to
have
a
demonstration
in
front
of
the
--
with
that
building
to
protest
against
this
arrest.
they
came;
they
move
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
notified
nobody,
and
the
officer
came
over
there
and
asked
them
what
they
were
doing
and
he
told
them,
he
said,
you
stay
on
this
side
of
the
street.
and
they
then
later
told
them
to
move
on
and
they
wouldn't
do
it.
if
you
--
are
you
claiming
that
your
sentence
is
passed
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
such
pressure
from
being
put
on
the
courts,
in
connection
of
cases
that
are
actually
there
that
time.
and
you're
claiming
that
louisiana
has
a
right
to
pass
that
law.
justice
hugo

what
is
the
difference
between
the
cases
as
you
see
it
there
and
the
case
that
i
--
hypothetical
case
that
i
mentioned
here.

but
then
the
court
had
to
do
and
stop
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
were
the
cases
to
be
tried?
justice
hugo
l.
black
against
the
people
who
were
in
jail.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
understand
what's
being
argued
here
if
that
statute
is
valid,
it's
made
a
crime
to
congregate
that
it
goes
to
the
court
that
that
some
of
your
officers
can
consent
to
have
that
filing
and
that
would
not
be
the
case
there?
do
you
understand
that
is
one
of
the
arguments
that
would
have
been?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'm
asking
in
that
case
is,
is
there
a
contrary
to
that?
they
are
the
government
people
who
told
these
certain
things
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
in
effect
that
there
was
no
precise
statute
of
any
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
stated
as
a
ground
of
the
opinion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
that
statute
copied
from
ours?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
anything
or
whatever
except
preventing
crowd
from
congregating
in
such
places
as
courthouse
or
court
building
--
a
building
where
the
court
officials,
the
judges
and
district
attorneys
and
so
forth
particularly
go.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
presume
its
aim
to
protecting
him
from
people
who
indeed
knew
what
they
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
basis
that
--
arrest
is
illegal,
convicted
with
charges
if
wrong
will
be
--
justice
will
be
administrative
in
the
regular
way
according
to
due
process
of
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
suppose
that
they
will
charge
me
of
a
crime
that
was
congregated
upon
a
court
that
they
would
be
in
a
basis
for
holding
if
they
only
wanted
to
influence
to
march
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
suppose
that
if
a
crowd
--
such
a
crowd
would
congregate
in
front
of
our
court
and
the
case
decided
passing
on
the
legality
of
it.
do
you
assume
that
such
at
that
time
they
really
--
the
judges
were
not
here
just
intended
to
intimidate
the
marching?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
question
that
i
asked
was,
assuming
they
gathered
out
here
would
be
--
would
be
a
strange
thing
to
hold
and
intended
to
influence
the
court
rather
than
marching.
would
that
be
an
unnecessary
unjustifiable
finding?
