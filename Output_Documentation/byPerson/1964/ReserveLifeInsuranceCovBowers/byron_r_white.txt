justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
that
this
--
the
case
would
have
a
great
bearing
on
it,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
not
suggesting
that
there's
any
greater
reason
for
discriminating
against
an
out-of-state
company
in
franchise
taxes
than
in
personal
property
tax
are
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
that
wouldn't
be
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
are
those
cases
in
your
brief,
those
later
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
possibility
of
increasing
the
franchise
tax
would
justify
all
other
types
of
discriminatory
taxes,
there
would've
been
a
blunder
of
case
here?
justice
byron

a
large
enough
difference
where
ohio
to
be
interested
in
it,
as
i
gather?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
when
they
are
domesticated
to
a

that
they
could
maybe
treated
differently
from
other
domesticated
--
domestic
corporations?
that's
in
effect
what
you're
saying
that
wheeling
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
wheeling,
although
it
said
that
once
you
admit
them,
you
must
be
(inaudible)
you
can
get
them
to
agree
in
advance
that
--
to
waive
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
the
question
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you're
saying
is
the
state
may
just
ignore
(inaudible)
of
a
foreign
corporation
as
long
as
it
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're(inaudible)--
you're
really
saying
