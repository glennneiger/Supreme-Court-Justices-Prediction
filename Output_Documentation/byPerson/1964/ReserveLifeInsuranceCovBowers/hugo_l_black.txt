a
domestic
company
doesn't
have
personal
property
tax?
justice
hugo
l.
black
quite
aside
from
that
brief,
the
statement
a
little
broad
that
the
state
can
impose
any
condition
it
sees
fit
before
admitting
the
corporation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
i'm
talking
about
uncon
--
are
there
not
some
unconstitutional
conditions,
does
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
our
federal
constitutional
rights
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
foreign
corporations
is
concerned,
(inaudible)
to
getting
to
a
state,
they
make
a
contract
anyway
and
that
the
state
can
require
them
to
make
a
promise
that
they
will
pay
more
taxes
than
the
other
whatever
the
state's
motive.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
(inaudible)
constitution
doesn't
permit
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
agree
i
suppose
that
if
it
had
tried
to
attach
a
condition
that
courts
held
couldn't
be
done,
they
would
not
enter
into
the
federal
courts
although
the
federal
law
gives
them
the
right
to
do
so.
they
could
not
impose
such
conditions
as
error.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
say
here
that
they
need
a
federal
constitution
nor
provision
nor
federal
law
which
permits
the
state
if
it
wishes
to
the
other
corporation
you
can't
come
in
here
unless
you
agree
in
the
interest
of
our
businesses
to
pay
a
little
more
tax
than
they
do,
that's
what
you
are
saying
in
substance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
that
in
the
--
suppose
ohio
had
a
law,
they
had
a
law
at
that
time
provided
generally
that
every
foreign
corporation
that
comes
into
the
state
to
do
business,
every
one
of
them
must
pay
a
little
larger
personal
property
tax.
they
do
that
and
all
they
do
is
follow
up
our
power
to
say
that
it
is
--
we
--
how
we
want
business
done
by
corporate
--
corporations
in
the
state
and
the
company
had
agreed
to
that
when
it
came
in,
would
you
say
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
make
that
contract
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
would
have
to
go
to
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
because
you
would
say
that
after
they
get
in
--
don't
the
--
didn't
make
any
difference
was
the
law
was
or
what
contract
has
been
made
or
what
the
reasons
were.
the
fourteenth
amendment
required
is
to
be
treated
in
taxes
like
the
others
are
to
be
taxed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
wasn't
discussed
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
--
that's
not
disputed
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
--
you
still
get
back
to
whether
the
condition
is
an
unconstitutional.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
not
understand
that
he
contests
with
the
idea,
the
state
(inaudible)
power
to
do
that.
what
he
said
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
with
it
--
this
condition
would
not
be
an
unconstitutional?
