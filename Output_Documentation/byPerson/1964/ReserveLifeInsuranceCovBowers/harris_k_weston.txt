mr.
harris
k.
weston
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
lindley.
this
case
comes
to
this
court
on
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
which
in
effect
upheld
certain
taxing
statutes
of
the
state
of
ohio
against
the
claim
that
they
were
invalid
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
in
dispute
and
they
were
stipulated
in
the
lower
proceedings.
appellant,
reserve
life
insurance
company,
is
a
texas
insurance
company,
a
stock
insurance
company,
a
legal
reserve
company
incorporated
under
the
laws
of
texas.
it
has
been
doing
business
in
ohio
ever
since
1947.
and
during
that
time,
it
has
fully
complied
with
the
statutes
and
all
of
the
rules
and
requirements
of
the
department
of
insurance.
during
this
period
of
time,
it
has
also
paid
annually
the
franchise
tax
which
the
state
of
ohio
requires
of
it.
it
has
never
paid
a
personal
property
tax
and
no
request
of
it
was
made
to
pay
such
a
tax
until
1959.
at
that
time,
a
reserve
--
a
promptly
raised
the
objection
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution
and
has
pressed
out
objection
at
every
stage
of
the
proceedings.
the
law
in
question
before
this
court
is
the
ohio
personal
property
tax
law.
it
is
applied
generally
on
all
tangible
personal
property
used
in
business.
as
applied
to
this
case,
it
applies
to
furniture,
fixtures,
office
equipment
owned
by
reserve
life
insurance
company.
a
foreign
life
insurance
company
in
ohio
is
subject
to
this
personal
property
tax,
probably
by
the
definition
of
the
statute
itself.
in
addition
to
that,
the
tax
commissioner
has
issued
a
rule
under
--
acting
under
the
statute
which
gives
him
the
right
to
designate
additional
taxpayers
not
included
in
the
definition
and
he
has
issued
a
specific
rule
stating
that
foreign
life
insurance
companies
are
taxpayers
under
the
ohio
personal
property
tax
law.
in
any
event,
the
courts
of
ohio
have
construed
the
law
to
apply
to
a
foreign
life
insurance
company.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
said
that
the
foreign
insurance
company
was
included
in
the
statute
itself
and
that
the
rule
of
the
tax
commissioner
was
really
of
no
effect.
in
any
case,
by
the
statute,
the
rule
of
the
tax
commissioner
and
the
court,
in
other
words
by
the
legislative
executive
and
judicial
branches
of
the
government
of
ohio
of
foreign
insurance
company
is
required
to
pay
this
personal
property
tax.
it
is
equally
clear
that
a
domestic
--
in
other
words,
an
ohio
insurance
company
does
not
pay
this
personal
property
tax.
this
comes
about
through
two
statutes;
the
first
is
the
definition
statute
section
5701
in
subparagraph
(b)
(3),
excludes
a
domestic
insurance
company
from
the
definition
of
a
taxpayer.
it
says,
“taxpayer
excludes
all
individuals,
partnerships,
corporations,
associations
and
joint
stock
companies,
their
executors,
administrators
and
receivers
who
are
defined
in
title
57
as
financial
institutions,
dealers
and
intangibles
domestic
insurance
companies
or
public
utilities”.
so
a
domestic
insurance
company
is
excluded
from
a
definition
of
taxpayer.
in
addition
to
that,
the
section
of
the
ohio
code
that
imposes
a
franchise
tax
on
--
an
ohio
insurance
company
has
a
provision
that
reads
in
this
way,
“the
real
estate
of
a
domestic
insurance
company
shall
be
taxed
in
a
place
where
it
is
located
the
same
as
the
real
estate
of
other
person
is
taxed”.
but
the
tax
provided
for
by
section
5725
(0)
(1)
to
26
includes
even
--
those
are
the
franchise
tax
sections
shall
be
in
lieu
of
all
other
taxes
on
the
other
property
and
assets
of
such
domestic
insurance
company.
so
that
both
by
definition
section
and
by
this
in
lieu
of
provision
a
--
an
ohio
insurance
company
does
not
pay
this
personal
property
tax.
now,
to
complete
the
picture
in
regard
to
ohio
taxes
as
applied
to
these
two
types
of
companies
because
this
may
be
important
to
the
court.
i
would
like
to
say
briefly
that
both
of
these
types
of
companies
do
pay
the
real
estate
tax,
obviously
at
the
same
rate.
neither
pays
an
intangible
personal
property
tax
and
both
pay
a
franchise
tax.
the
franchise
tax
is
not
the
same,
however
for
the
two
companies.
a
foreign
insurance
company
pays
a
franchise
tax
at
the
rate
of
2.5%
of
its
gross
premiums
from
ohio
business
less
certain
deductions.
a
domestic
insurance
company
has
a
choice
of
two
methods
of
computing
its
franchise
tax.
one
is
at
the
rate
of
one
and
two-thirds
percent
of
its
gross
premiums
less
the
same
deductions
and
the
court
will
observe
that
2.5%
is
50%
higher
than
1
2/3%,
so
that
a
foreign
insurance
company
pays
a
franchise
tax
50%
higher
than
a
domestic
insurance
company.
in
addition,
a
domestic
insurance
company
has
an
alternative
method
of
paying
the
tax
which
is
based
on
its
capital
and
surplus
and
it
would
use
that
method
only
if
it
should
be
cheaper.
and
of
course
if
it
uses
that
method,
then
the
discrimination
between
the
franchise
taxes
would
be
greater
than
50%.
but
in
any
case,
foreign
company
pays
a
franchise
tax
at
least
50%
higher
than
the
domestic
one.
we
thus
have
the
tax
structure
of
ohio
as
applied
to
these
companies.
each
pays
a
real
estate
tax
at
the
same
rate.
neither
pays
a
personal
property
tax
on
intangibles.
a
foreign
insurance
company
only
pays
a
personal
property
tax
on
tangible
personal
property,
and
each
pays
a
franchise
tax
but
the
foreign
company's
tax
is
at
least
50%
higher.
now,
in
this
case
--
mr.
harris
k.
weston
no
sir.
and
that
is
what
we
are
protesting.
we
are
claiming
that
the
--
it
is
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
to
require
a
foreign
insurance
company
to
pay
this
personal
property
tax
when
a
domestic
company
does
not
do
so.
mr.
harris
k.
weston
no
sir.
mr.
harris
k.
weston
on
the
franchise
tax?
mr.
harris
k.
weston
well,
i
don't
know.
assuming
that
this
court
should
agree
with
us
and
declare
the
personal
property
tax
invalid
what
the
ohio
legislature
would
do
about
it,
i
wouldn't
want
to
presume.
mr.
harris
k.
weston
your
honor,
we
have
only
pointed
out
the
discrimination
in
the
franchise
tax
to
counter
an
argument
that
has
been
made
by
the
state
of
ohio
and
was
alluded
to
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
appears
in
a
previous
decision
of
this
court
namely
the
concordia
life
insurance
company
case.
to
indicate
that
under
certain
structures
of
state
taxation,
there
may
be
some
balancing
effect
of
some
other
tax
and
we
have
only
set
out
at
considerable
length
the
fact
that
the
foreign
company
pays
a
franchise
tax
greater
than
a
domestic
company,
one
does
to
show
that
this
so-called
in
lieu
provision
is
merely
words.
there
are
no
taxes
that
a
domestic
company
pays
in
lieu
of
the
one
that
the
foreign
company
pays.
mr.
harris
k.
weston
from
the
point
of
view
of
logic
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
see
any
but
--
mr.
harris
k.
weston
--
the
courts
have
nevertheless
permitted
that.
mr.
harris
k.
weston
there
are
number
of
cases
of
that
have
permitted
that.
although
interestingly
enough,
a
--
the
case
of
hanover
fire
insurance
company
versus
harding
suggests
that
the
proper
test
ought
to
be
that
the
state
could
impose
through
its
police
power
of
requirements
for
admission
which
would
be
different
from
the
requirements
of
a
domestic
company
and
while
it
doesn't
go
into
this
it
would
appear
to
be
this
would
be
--
the
amount
of
securities
that
it
must
have
on
hand
to
protect
policy
holders
or
an
adequate
provision
to
be
sure
that
its
record
are
in
good
shape
and
so
on.
but
that
--
to
the
extent
the
tax
is
to
raise
revenue
for
the
state
as
oppose
to
the
police
power
to
protect
the
citizens,
then
they
should
be
equal.
however,
other
cases
and
later
cases
of
this
court
have
permitted
a
discriminatory
franchise
tax
that
did
not
base
itself
on
the
police
power
and
we
are
not
here
contesting
the
franchise.
mr.
harris
k.
weston
no,
they
are
not
your
honor
because
they
--
we
did
not
consider
them
necessary
but
they
are,
lincoln
national
life
company
versus
reed,
325
u.s.
673
and
prudential
insurance
company
versus
benjamin,
328
u.s.
408.
mr.
harris
k.
weston
the
--
our
principal
case
on
which
we
rely
here
is
the
case
of
wheeling
steel
corporation
versus
glander,
this
is
337
u.s.
562.
it
is
perhaps
interesting
that
this
also
came
up
from
the
state
of
ohio
and
also
involved
the
ohio
personal
property
tax.
in
the
wheeling
steel
case,
ohio
had
construed
its
statute
to
apply
to
accounts
receivable
owned
by
--
certain
account
receivable
owned
by
foreign
companies
but
not
the
same
type
of
accounts
receivable
owned
by
domestic
companies.
this
was
challenged
on
the
ground
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
and
the
court
held
that
it
was
invalid.
and
it
drew
this
distinction
that
has
been
alluded
to
by
mr.
justice
white,
in
fact
perhaps
because
of
this
i
should
read
the
full
quote.
it
said,
“under
a
long
settled
principles
of
our
federation,
ohio
was
not
required
to
admit
these
foreign
corporations
to
carry
on
intrastate
business
within
its
boarders.
the
state
may
arbitrarily
exclude
them
or
may
license
them
upon
any
terms
it
sees
fit
apart
from
exacting
surrender
of
rights
derived
from
the
constitution
of
united
states.
ohio
elected
however
to
admit
this
corporations
to
transact
business
and
operate
manufacturing
plants
in
the
state.
for
that
privilege,
they
have
paid
all
that
the
state
required
by
way
of
franchise
or
privilege
tax
which
includes
in
its
measure
the
value
of
all
property
owned
and
business
done
in
ohio.”
then
this
part
which
i
would
particularly
like
to
emphasize,
“after
a
state
has
chosen
to
domesticate
foreign
corporations,
the
adopted
corporations
are
entitled
to
equal
protection
with
the
state's
own
corporate
progeny,
at
least
to
the
extent
that
their
property
is
entitled
to
an
equally
favorable
ad
valorem
tax
basis.”
ohio
holds
this
tax
on
intangibles
to
be
an
ad
valorem
property
tax
and
in
no
sense
a
franchise
privilege
occupation
or
income
tax.
here
of
course,
again,
there
is
no
question
whatsoever
that
this
is
a
property
tax,
an
ad
valorem
property
tax.
and
we
think
that
we
come
clearly
within
that
announcement
of
this
court.
let
me
turn
briefly
to
certain
points
raised
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
state
of
ohio.
one
is,
there
are
some
talk
in
the
--
in
that
decision,
that
the
personal
property
of
domestic
insurance
company
is
not
expressly
exempted
(inaudible)
--
exempted
in
quotes
does
not
say
in
so
many
word
in
--
does
not
use
the
word
exempt
but
the
effect
is
equally
clear
is
a
--
domestic
insurance
company
is
excluded
and
it
does
use
that
word
from
the
definition
of
a
taxpayer
under
the
personal
property
tax
and
the
franchise
tax
laws
says
that
it
is
in
lieu
of
all
other
taxes.
so
it's
perfectly
clear
that
a
domestic
insurance
company
does
not
pay
a
personal
property
tax
on
this
personal
property.
secondly,
there
is
the
possibility
alluded
to
of
an
equalizing
tax.
some
other
form
of
tax
that
makes
up
for
this
fact
and
as
for
that
reason
that
we
have
explained
the
real
estate
tax,
the
intangible
personal
property
tax,
and
the
franchise
tax,
to
show
clearly
that
there
is
no
tax
that
an
ohio
company
pays
that
a
foreign
company
does
not
pay
that
would
act
as
a
balancing
feature,
none
whatsoever.
the
court
of
appeals
mentions
the
possibility
of
reasonable
classifications
and
of
course
a
state
may
classify
companies
and
it
may
have
for
instance
a
different
type
of
tax
on
utilities
or
it
may
have
as
ohio
has
chosen
to
have
for
its
domestic
company
the
different
type
of
tax
for
insurance
companies
that
it
has
for
manufacturing
companies.
but
there
is
no
difference
here
between
the
foreign
insurance
company
and
the
domestic
one
except
the
residence
of
the
company.
and
again,
i
would
like
to
make
a
quote
from
the
wheeling
steel
case.
this
is
at
572,
“if
on
the
taxing
date,
one
of
these
petitioners
and
an
ohio
competitor
--”
one
of
these
petitions
that
were
two
cases
is
actually
litigating
the
wheeling
steel
case.
“one
of
this
petitioners
and
an
ohio
competitor
each
owns
an
accounts
receivable
of
the
same
amount
from
the
same
out-of-state
customer
for
the
same
type
of
commodity,
both
shipped
from
the
manufacturing
plant
in
ohio
and
both
sold
out
of
ohio
by
an
agent
having
an
office
out-of-the
state.
appellant's
account
receivable
would
be
subject
to
ohio's
ad
valorem
tax
and
the
one
held
by
the
competing
domestic
corporation
would
not.
it
seems
obvious
that
appellants
are
not
accorded
equal
treatment
and
the
inequality
is
not
because
of
the
slightest
deference
in
ohio's
relationship
--
relation
to
the
decisive
transaction,
but
solely
because
of
the
different
residence
of
the
owner.”
and
we
submit
that
the
exact
same
situation
is
here.
one
or
two
other
brief
references,
there's
a
sort
of
a
suggestion
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
maybe
it's
necessary
to
look
to
texas
law
and
see
if
there
are
some
sort
of
balancing
feature
there.
but
it's
clear
i
think
that
texas
law
could
not
tax
in
any
way
personal
property
in
ohio
and
the
only
law
that
texas
has
that
has
any
bearing
on
an
ohio
insurance
company
is
a
so-called
retaliatory
tax
law.
ohio
has
this,
almost
all
state
possibly
all,
but
i
know
almost
all
states
have
this
retaliatory
tax
law.
and
what
they
say
is,
“that
if
another
state
taxes
an
ohio
insurance
company
to
do
business
there
at
a
greater
rate
than
ohio
tax
is
that
other
state's
company
doing
business
in
ohio,
and
ohio
shall
impose
the
same
tax
on
a
company
of
another
state
doing
business
in
ohio
as
that
other
state
imposes
on
an
ohio
company.”
now,
texas
has
that
law
but
this
cannot
at
all
affect
the
personal
property
tax.
oh,
i
might
say
by
way
of
passing
that
because
of
the
discriminatory
ohio
franchise
tax,
there
is
at
least
one
company
in
ohio,
insurance
company
that
pays
in
33
other
states,
not
on
the
basis
of
their
franchise
tax
but
on
the
basis
of
their
retaliatory
tax
because
ohio's
tax
on
other
companies
doing
business
in
ohio
is
so
much
higher.
the
court
of
appeals
also
indicates
that
there
might
be
some
difficulty
in
granting
us
the
relief
we
asked
even
if
we're
entitled
to
it.
this
seems
a
little
bit
weird
but
there
doesn't
appeared
to
be
any
difficulty,
if
this
court
should
nullify
the
tax
then
we
just
wouldn't
have
to
pay
it
and
if
ohio
wants
to
--
if
ohio
legislature
wants
to
look
at
its
tax
structure
again,
it
could,
but
there's
no
difficulty
in
bringing
this
about.
in
one
final
argument
which
is
raised
by
the
appellee
in
its
answer
brief
here,
and
that
is
essentially
that
since
it
may
discriminate
against
us
in
regard
to
a
franchise
tax,
why
it
may
discriminate
against
us
in
any
other
form
if
wants
to
in
addition?
now,
this
also
seems
very
strange.
it
would
indicate
that
they
could
discriminate
against
us
if
this
argument
were
adopted,
the
real
state
tax,
type
of
gasoline
taxes
we
would
pay,
anything
at
all.
in
addition
to
the
logical
difficulty,
it
seems
clear
that
this
court
not
only
in
the
wheeling
steel
case
but
also
in
the
hanover
insurance
company
case,
hanover
fire
insurance
company
versus
harding
held
exactly
to
the
contrary
and
i
made
this
quotation
from
the
wheeling
steel
case
that
they
can
--
ohio
can
make
us
pay
an
extra
franchise
tax
but
must
treat
us
equally
on
ad
velorem
taxes
and
that
--
mr.
harris
k.
weston
pardon
me?
mr.
harris
k.
weston
this
is
possible
mr.
justice
brennan
and
i
think
--
well,
obviously
what
would
happen,
we
don't
know.
it
seems
to
me
that
perhaps
there
might
be
some
point
at
which
this
would
become
overbearing
and
unfair.
mr.
harris
k.
weston
there
is
a
fair
amount
involved,
partially
at
least
because
it
goes
back
to
1948.
but
specifically
to
answer
your
question,
the
tax
has
varied
depending
on
these
years
as
the
company
has
built
up
and
acquired
more
property.
but
it
amounts
to
--
although
approximately
30
to
$35,000
plus
certain
interest
and
penalties
that
might
be
imposed
upon
us.
mr.
harris
k.
weston
yes.
we
are
running
now
at
the
rate
of
around
$3000
a
year,
it
started
around
1000
and
still
up.
mr.
harris
k.
weston
that's
right
your
honor.
if
it
would
be
agreed
with
the
court,
i'd
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
harris
k.
weston
mr.
chief
justice,
other
justices,
i'll
be
very
brief
in
my
reply.
first,
there
was
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
foreign
companies
may
or
may
not
own
much
real
estate.
i
don't
think
the
court
can
decide
constitutional
questions
on
that.
in
any
event
reserve
life
insurance
company
does
own
real
estate
in
the
state
of
ohio.
as
far
as
the
more
important
problems
are
concern,
as
i
said
in
my
initial
presentation
a
state
may
make
classifications
and
some
discrepancy
in
taxes
may
occur
because
of
those
classifications,
those
are
the
common
examples
of
utility
companies
or
to
some
extent
even
insurance
companies
in
ohio
airlines
are
taxed
differently
and
so
on.
but
the
effect
as
i
understand
it
of
the
equal
protection
clause
is
that
those
differences
must
have
some
bearing
on
the
matter
being
cons
--
being
classified
and
that
certain
differences
are
not
allowable
as
classifications,
their
differences
of
rates
(inaudible)
cannot
make
a
different
kind
of
classification,
you
cannot
do
it
on
--
similarly
you
cannot
do
it
on
questions
of
residence.
and
this
is
what
has
been
pointed
out
in
the
wheeling
steel
case
that
in
that
case
everything
was
the
same
except
for
residence
and
that
is
no
good
as
a
classification.we
maintain
the
same
thing
here.
mr.
harris
k.
weston
yes,
mr.
justice
black,
it
would.
mr.
harris
k.
weston
yes,
i
would.
and
i
would
--
mr.
harris
k.
weston
yes
mr.
justice
black.
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
by
stating
that
in
the
wheeling
steel
case
no
--
nothing
was
turned
in
the
decision
on
whether
this
unequal
taxation
came
about
before
they
came
in
or
afterwards,
there
was
no
point
mentioned.
mr.
harris
k.
weston
that's
right.
and
furthermore,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
case
of
hanover
fire
insurance
company
versus
harding
at
272
united
states
and
to
read
briefly
from
that
decision.
it
says,
“the
general
principle
--”,
we'll
let
me
skip
that.
“there
is
one
--
there
is
a
very
important
qualification
to
the
power
of
the
state,
the
recognition
and
enforcement
of
which
are
shown
in
a
number
of
decisions
in
recent
years.
that
qualification
is
the
state
may
not
exact
as
the
condition
of
a
corporation
engaging
in
business
within
its
limits
that
its
rights
secured
to
it
by
the
constitution
maybe
infringed.”
mr.
harris
k.
weston
well,
it
seemed
to
me
that
perhaps
the
state
were
saying
that
if
they
agreed
in
advance
to
pay
a
higher
real
--
property
tax,
that
would
be
alright.
mr.
harris
k.
weston
that's
correct.
mr.
harris
k.
weston
no.
mr.
harris
k.
weston
yes
sir.
now,
i
just
like
to
point
out
the
court
then
goes
on
to
give
several
examples.
one
is
under
the
commerce
clause
and
there're
several
citations
there.
one
is
that
in
a
certain
case
the
state
attempted
to
subject
foreign
corporations
to
the
payment
of
a
tax,
not
only
on
the
property
but
property
without
the
estate
which
violated
the
due
process
clause
and
that
could
not
be
imposed.
and
then
finally,
in
the
cases
of
a
class
to
which
is
contented
the
present
case
belongs
where
tax
are
licensed
law
operates
to
deny
them
--
to
deny
to
the
foreign
corporation
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
so
specifically,
it
has
been
mentioned
in
the
hanover
case
that
you
cannot
impose
a
violation
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
at
all.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up
and
i
would
conclude
by
stating
that
we
think
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
primarily
the
wheeling
steel
case
also
the
hanover
case
that
this
is
a
violation
of
equal
protection
clause.
thank
you.
