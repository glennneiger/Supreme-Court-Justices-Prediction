real

tax

justice

is
that
you're
telling
us?
justice
potter
stewart
because
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
domestic
companies
likely
to
own
more
real
estate,
is
that
what
you're
telling
us?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
want
to
be
--
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
the
supposed
legislative
assumption
that
you
are
telling
us
about.
is
it
(inaudible)
--
domestic
insurance
companies
likely
to
own
more
real
estate?
justice
potter
stewart
and
with
respect
to
real
estate,
are
insurance
companies
taxed
in
the
same
way
and
at
the
same
rate
as
any
other
real
--
owner
of
real
estate
in
ohio?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
any
given
tax,
the
taxing
district
there
tax
as
any
other
owner
real
estate
in
ohio?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
a
foreign
insurance
company
does
own
real
estate,
that
company
is
taxed
with
the
same
rate
and
in
the
same
way
at
any
given
taxing
district
as
a
domestic
insurance
company
or
as
any
other
owner
of
real
estate,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
a
little
bit
--
at
least
conceptually
or
a
matter
of
principle,
it's
a
little
more
than
just
that,
isn't
it?
it's
the
--
i
--
as
i
understand
the
appellant,
he
says
that
at
least
for
purposes
of
this
case,
in
this
argument,
he
is
conceding
that
a
--
ohio
or
any
other
state
a
condition,
its
permission
to
a
foreign
insurance
company
to
come
in
and
do
business
in
the
state
in
any
way
at
least
within
reason
that
it
wants
to
by
charging
a
higher
price
for
their
--
for
that
permission
to
do
business
or
in
any
other
condition?
but
once
having
done
so,
once
the
company
is
there
doing
business
as
an
insurance
company
in
that
--
and
that
paying
the
rules
as
this
company
has
as
superintendent
of
insurance,
then
from
that
point
on
it
has
to
be
treated
equally
as
any
--
as
a
domestic
insurance
company
once
it's
in,
that's
the
reason
--
there's
a
real
distinction
at
least
conceptually
between
the
franchise
tax
and
the
--
any
difference
in
between
the
rate
of
tax
and
on
the
franchise
and
this
personal
property
tax,
isn't
that
right?
it's
not
just
a
matter
--
is
maybe
as
a
practical
matter
you're
quite
right
it's
just
to
matter
how
much
money
but
as
a
conceptual
matter,
a
constitutional
matter,
there's
a
real
difference,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see
your
point.
you're
saying
that
this
was
one
of
the
conditions
under
which
they
were
admitted?
