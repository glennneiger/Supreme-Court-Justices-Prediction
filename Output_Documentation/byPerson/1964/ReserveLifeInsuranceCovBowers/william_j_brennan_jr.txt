j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
could
you
(inaudible)
that
we
agree
with
you
about
the
phase
of
property
tax
even
that
that
wouldn't
support
the
--
your
insistent
with
the
discrimination
of
franchise
tax
itself
which
is
under
that
--
also
in
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that
to
say
then,
i'd
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
to
say
then
that
you're
right
here,
tomorrow
the
ohio
legislature
can
just
increase
the
percentage
of
the
franchise
tax
perhaps
to
pay
and
get
as
much
some

now
on

complaint

now
offended
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
while
is
there
a
great

william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
--
that's
the
accumulation
since
1948?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
anything
in
the
wheeling
steel
opinion
to
suggest
that
the
wheeling
had
come
in
after
1944,
that
seems
to
be
--
have
been
different
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
there
any
reference
in
that
opinion,
i've
forgotten
frankly,
to
the
dates
of
admission
to
do
business
of
either
wheeling
steel
or
in
the
other
case,
the
distillers
case?
