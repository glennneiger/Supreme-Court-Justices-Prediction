mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices.
i
think
the
first
thing
that
we
should
do
is
to
place
this
case
in
proper
perspective
of
pointing
out
that
it
is
true
that
the
real
estate
of
both
domestic
and
foreign
insurance
companies
in
ohio
is
taxed
in
the
same
manner
and
this
is
pursuant
to
an
ohio
constitutional
provision
which
requires
all
real
estate
to
be
taxed
by
uniform
rule.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
belief
in
the
legislature
that
the
real
estate
tax
is
tied
in
any
way
with
franchise
tax
or
the
personal
property
tax
insofar
as
these
provisions
are
concern.
also,
it
is
true
that
the
intangibles
of
insurance
companies
both
domestic
and
foreign
are
exempted
in
taxation
in
the
state
of
ohio.
the
franchise
tax
on
insurance
companies
in
ohio
both
foreign
and
domestic
is
upon
the
same
basis.
under
certain
conditions,
the
rate
of
franchise
tax
on
domestics
is
1.67%
and
the
rate
on
foreigns
is
2.5%.
the
appellant
has
indicated
that
this
is
a
50%
discrepancy.
i
think
it
is
just
as
logical
to
point
out
that
this
is
a
difference
in
rate
of
slightly
less
than
1%.
using
the
appellant's
line
of
argument,
the
discrepancy
in
the
case
of
prudential
insurance
company
versus
benjamin
which
was
mentioned
is
in
north
carolina
case
must
have
been
an
infinite
discrepancy
because
there,
as
i
recall
that
case,
the
domestics
were
taxed
at
0%
and
foreigns
at
3%
and
a
discrepancy
on
a
ratio
of
basis
from
zero
to
three
becomes
infinite.
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
yes
sir.
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
yes
it
is,
certainly.
just
as
in
the
case
of
the
lincoln
national
insurance
company
in
oklahoma,
the
2%
was
large
enough
so
that
take
to
be
interested.
now,
section
5725.25
of
the
ohio
revised
code
does
provide
that
the
franchise
tax
levied
on
domestic
insurance
companies
shall
be
in
lieu
of
all
other
taxes.
and
section
5711.01
of
the
ohio
revised
code
which
levies
a
personal
property
tax
does
provide
by
the
definition
of
taxpayer
that
domestic
insurance
company
shall
be
excluded,
these
are
companion
sections.
but
the
mere
fact
that
you
have
an
in
lieu
of
provision
in
section
5725.25
does
not
automatically
mean
that
we
must
be
able
to
find
some
specific
substitute
for
that
tax
in
some
other
provision.
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
ohio
has
attempted
and
has
seen
fit
to
provide
a
tax
discrepancy
or
may
point
out
i
think
that
we
are
not
here
concerned
with
a
question
of
commerce
or
equality
in
commerce
such
as
the
appellant
mentions
at
page
18
in
its
brief.
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
and
the
congress
has
recognized
that
in
the
area
of
insurance
companies,
states
have
a
vital
concern
in
the
taxation
and
regulation
of
insurance
companies.
i
submit
that
as
we
understand
the
rule,
it
is
not
every
discrepancy.
it
is
not
every
distinction
that
has
been
denied
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution.
it
is
our
understanding
that
those
distinctions
which
have
a
rational
basis
maybe
approved
and
this
court
has
held
that
legislation
will
be
sustained
where
there
are
conceivable
rational
basis
for
the
legislative
act.
now,
i
think
it
is
certainly
conceivable
and
rational
to
assume
that
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
ohio
had
a
desire
to
foster
the
development
and
creation
of
insurance
companies
within
the
state.
these
are
desirable
types
of
business.
it
is
also
i
think
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
ohio
knew
or
believed
that
domestic
insurance
companies
would
own
more
real
estate
in
ohio
than
foreign
insurance
companies.
after
all,
most
domestic
insurance
companies
have
their
home
offices
in
the
states
in
which
they
are
domestic
company.
in
this
sense
then,
even
though
the
franchise
tax
rate
is
different
and
even
though
the
domestic
insurance
companies
are
taxed
under
the
franchise
tax
law
and
in
lieu
of
personal
property
tax
the
domestic
companies
may
have
pay
in
relation
to
their
total
business
an
amount
comparable
with
the
amount
paid
in
taxes
by
foreign
insurance
companies.
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
yes
sir.
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
yes
sir.
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
but
i'm
saying
is
--
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
--
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that,
these
i
think
are
logical
basis
of
assumptions
on
the
part
of
the
ohio
legislature
in
enacting
this
in
lieu
of
provision.
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
possible
justifiable
assumptions,
yes
si8r.
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
they
are
taxed
in
the
same
way.
i
cannot
exactly
say
at
the
same
rate
because
in
ohio
the
rate
of
taxation
varies
from
taxing
district
to
taxing
district
depending
upon
the
local
levies.
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
yes
sir.
yes,
sir
that
is
correct.
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
that
is
correct.
now,
the
appellant
has
relied
very
strongly
on
wheeling
steel
and
we
also
rely
on
this
case.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
appellant
has
overlooked
one
controlling
factor
in
wheeling
steel.
first
of
all,
wheeling
steel
was
a
company
which
had
been
admitted
to
do
business
in
ohio
in
1923
and
then
the
companion
case
national
distillers
products
corporation,
that
company
was
admitted
in
1936.
now,
this
case
came
up
as
a
result
and
this
is
recited
in
a
certificate
form
the
tax
commissioner
which
is
quoted
by
this
court
in
its
opinion,
“as
a
result
of
not
just
an
interpretation
of
the
bare
words
of
the
statute
on
the
statute
books
but
of
the
interpretation
of
the
law
as
enacted
by
the
ohio
legislature,
as
construed
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
and
then
as
administratively
applied
by
the
tax
commission.”
now,
the
construction
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
in
that
case
occurred
in
1944.
before
that
case
was
decided
by
the
ohio
supreme
court,
both
domestic
and
foreign
companies
were
insofar
as
the
type
of
accounts
receivable
there
involved
concerned,
taxed
in
exactly
the
same
basis.
the
certificate
which
excluded
by
this
court
and
its
opinion
in
the
wheeling
steel
case
recites
that
since
the
decision
of
the
randolph
and
ransom
case
in
1944,
the
tax
commissioner's
policy
was
to
tax
only
the
accounts
receivable
of
the
nature
there
involved
of
foreign
insurance
companies.
now
this
court
said
in
that
case
that
in
questions
of
constitutional
law,
one
must
look
not
only
at
the
law
but
at
the
administration
and
at
the
application.
so
what
we
had
in
the
wheeling
steel
case
was
a
change
in
the
law
through
judicial
interpretation
and
administrative
application
which
resulted
in
a
different
treatment
after
the
companies
had
been
admitted.
and
that
difference
was
to
the
disparagement
of
the
foreign
companies
and
to
the
enhancement
of
the
domestics,
and
this
court
i
think
promptly
found
that
that
was
an
unreasonable
distinction.
now,
what
do
we
have
in
this
case?
in
this
case,
we
have
a
foreign
insurance
company
which
applied
for
admission
into
the
state
of
ohio
in
1947.
it
applied
for
admission
under
the
law
as
then
as
it
is
today,
under
a
law
which
excluded
from
the
definition
of
taxpayer,
domestic
insurance
companies.
and
under
a
law
which
provided
that
the
franchise
tax
paid
by
domestic
insurance
companies
shall
be
in
lieu
of
a
tax
on
a
personal
property.
now,
as
we
understand
the
application
and
the
rulings
of
this
court,
it
is
that
insofar
as
the
admission
of
a
foreign
insurance
company
is
concerned
a
state
is
not
required
to
admit
a
foreign
company.
furthermore,
if
it
does
admit
a
foreign
company
it
may
impose
upon
that
admission
any
conditions
which
it
seems
fit.
it
is
only
after
the
company
has
been
admitted
that
it
may
not
discriminate
against
that
company
in
favor
of
local
companies
or
in
favor
of
someone
else.
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
i
think,
yes
your
honor.
i
have
to
say
that
--
and
i
believe
there
is
because
the
court
in
that
case
specifically
indicated
that
it
was
apply
--
construing
the
law
as
written
and
as
interpreted
by
the
local
court
--
by
the
state
court.
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
no.
the
opinion
of
that
case
does
not
state
the
dates
of
admission
of
those
two
companies
other
than
to
indicate
that
they
were
admitted
before
the
case
arose.
and
then
of
course
there
is
the
certificate
of
the
commissioner
in
the
case
which
defines
that
the
policy
which
says
--
starts
out
with
the
word
“since”
1947,
we
have
done
this.
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
i
think
--
it's
my
understanding
that
as
to
the
admission
--
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
well,
the
obvious
--
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
--
qualification
is
that
it
cannot
require
surrender
of
constitutional
rights
as
a
condition
of
admission.
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
that's
correct.
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
yes
sir.
now,
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
in
this
case,
reserve
life
insurance
company
applied
for
admission
under
the
law
as
existed
in
1947.
it
accepted
admission
under
that
law.
it
never
complied
with
that
law
but
nonetheless,
these
were
conditions
under
which
it
applied
for
and
was
admitted
and
impliedly
at
least
accept
it
as
a
part
of
that
admission.
now,
we
submit
that
the
difference
in
the
taxation
here
is
not
such
a
difference
as
to
be
said
to
be
a
denial
or
a
surrender
of
basic
constitutional
rights.
we
think
the
degree
of
difference
is
reasonable
that
it
can
be
assume
to
have
a
rational
basis.
in
the
lincoln
national
insurance
company
case
which
was
referred
to
the
discrepancy,
the
tax
involved
there
was
4%
on
a
franchise
tax
basis.
now,
it
was
mentioned
that
the
effect
of
a
ruling
in
favor
of
reserve
life
in
this
case
would
just
be
a
session
of
the
higher
legislature
and
which
they
would
raise
a
franchise
tax
law.
and
the
appellant
apparently
agrees
that
this
can
be
done.
it
seems
that
the
appellant
is
only
concern
here
with
the
method
of
taxation
and
we
submit
that
where
there
are
two
methods
which
are
properly
employed,
a
taxpayer
cannot
challenge
one
simply
because
he
would
have
preferred
to
have
the
other
one
employed.
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
well,
your
honor,
i
really
don't
think
the
difference
is
very
great
because
in
the
first
place,
this
is
not
a
change
which
was
made
after
the
company
was
admitted.
this
is
not
a
distinction
which
is
being
made
after
the
admission
which
makes
some
difference
between
the
domestic
and
the
foreign
company.
this
was
a
condition
which
existed
long
before
this
company
was
admitted
into
ohio.
and
this
was
a
condition
under
which
this
company
applied
for
admission.
they
knew
of
this
definition
of
taxpayer
or
should
have
known
if
they
read
the
statutes.
they
knew
of
the
in
lieu
of
provision
or
should
have
known
as
they
read
the
statutes
and
they
applied
for
admission
under
this
condition.
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
that's
right.
and
in
this
sense,
it
is
distinguished
for
from
the
wheeling
steel
because
those
companies
were
admitted
and
then
the
law
was
changed
by
judicial
interpretation
and
administrative
application.
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
i
think
--
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
i
think
essentially
the
admission
of
a
foreign
corporation
your
honor
is
a
matter
of
contract
providing
the
contract
does
not
go
so
far
as
to
deprive
the
foreign
corporation
of
their
fundamental
federal
constitutional
rights.
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
that's
right.
and
we
submit
that
under
the
previous
rulings
of
this
court,
the
distinction
in
this
case
is
not
so
great
as
to
be
said
not
to
have
a
reasonable
and
rational
basis
and
that
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
ohio
may
have
had
a
perfectly
invalid
interest
in
protecting
in
advancing
the
welfare
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
ohio
in
seeking
to
encourage
the
location
and
development
of
insurance
companies
in
the
state
of
ohio.
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
this
--
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
this
was
exactly
the
case
in
the
lincoln
insurance
company
case
in
oklahoma.
the
company
had
agreed
to
pay
all
the
taxes
which
the
state
levied
on
a
year-to-year
basis
as
a
condition
to
the
annual
renewal
of
their
certificate
and
the
state
raised
--
the
state
of
oklahoma
raised
the
tax
from
2%
to
4%
and
they
contested
it
and
it
was
upheld.
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
i
think
that's
true,
they
could
not
go
that
far.
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
no,
what
i'm
saying
justice
black
is
that
it
is
not
every
distinction
of
degree
that
is
unconstitutional.
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
in
this
case,
the
difference
is
not
great
and
the
difference
is
compatible
with
the
desire
and
public
purpose
interest
of
this
legislature
of
the
state
of
ohio
to
encourage
the
location
of
insurance
companies
in
the
state
of
ohio.
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
no,
i
don't
think
that
i
would
go
that
far
justice
white.
there
are
areas
beyond
which
you
cannot
go.
i
don't
think
for
example
that
you
could
say
that
--
mr.
edgar
l.
lindley
that's
true,
with
one
minor
exception,
which
i'd
like
to
comment
on
in
the
close
of
my
argument.
i
would
approach
that
now.
we
have
raised
in
our
brief
one
question
concerning
the
basic
qualifications
of
this
appellant
to
raise
this
question
here.
no,
i
don't
propose
to
go
in
to
the
history
of
this
argument
because
this
has
been
recited
many
times
and
i'm
sure
the
court
is
fully
familiar
with
it.
the
distinction
i
would
like
to
make,
this
is
the
argument
we
made
to
the
effect
at
this
corporation
is
not
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
first
of
all
i
want
to
say,
we
are
not
arguing
that
corporations
are
not
persons.
and
almost
every
case
we
would
concede
the
corporations
are
persons
but
what
we
are
saying
is
that
a
state
creates
an
artificial
being
in
the
nature
of
a
corporation
that
it
endows
this
artificial
being
with
certain
rights
and
in
almost
every
instance
these
rights
are
the
same
as
the
rights
of
persons
and
they
are
indistinguishable
and
therefore
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
apply.
but
on
rare
occasions,
a
state
may
endow
a
corporation
with
rates
less
than
those
of
natural
persons
or
with
rates
greater
than
those
at
natural
persons.
in
this
situation,
we
think
the
fourteenth
amendment
may
not
be
applied
and
i
can
best
demonstrate
this
i
think
by
analogy.
if
we
were
to
take
two
materials
and
place
some
here
and
some
here,
and
to
tell
you
that
each
of
these
are
white
granular
in
form,
each
will
melt
when
it's
supposed
to
aflame,
each
will
dissolve
in
water
that
each
has
the
characteristic
of
participating
out
a
saturated
solution
in
the
form
of
crystals.
you
might
conclude
that
these
are
the
same
things.
but
then
i
would
tell
you
that
this
one
when
dissolved
in
water
will
make
the
solutions
sweet
and
this
one
will
make
the
solution
salty,
you
know
immediately
that
they
are
not
the
same
thing
that
one
is
sugar
and
one
is
salt.
and
the
reason
you
know
this
is
because
you
have
recognized
the
characteristic,
the
things
themselves
appear
entirely
the
same.
well,
in
the
state
of
ohio,
we
have
created
and
admitted
a
corporation
which
has
been
given
all
the
rights
of
people.
it
has
the
right
to
sue
and
the
right
to
be
sued,
the
right
to
contract
and
so
forth.
but
it
has
an
addition
to
this,
been
given
another
rate,
a
second
franchise
and
this
had
obtained
not
directly
from
the
secretary
of
state
in
the
sense
of
each
being
a
corporate
charter
but
from
the
director
of
the
department
of
insurance.
and
this
was
a
right
--
to
right
life
insurance
in
the
state
of
ohio.
this
right,
the
people
of
the
state
of
ohio
as
individuals
do
not
have.
and
what
we're
saying
is
that
in
the
exercise
of
this
peculiar
right
and
only
this
right
as
distinguished
from
all
of
the
other
rights
that
it
may
have,
it
may
not
be
a
person
entitled
to
claim
the
benefit
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
submit
however
that
in
the
final
analysis,
the
court
does
not
really
have
to
reach
at
this
point
because
we
think
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
argument
which
i
have
pointed
out
in
connection
with
the
wheeling
steel
company
case,
and
we
submit
that
there
is
in
essence
no
question
which
cannot
be
resolved
on
the
basis
of
that
case
and
that
the
decisions
of
the
lower
court
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
