mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
actually
decided
which
to
me
was
a
question
of
pleading.
the
alabama
supreme
court
in
substance
held
that
the
petitioner
here
had
not
properly
pleaded
the
necessary
facts
or
even
conclusions
for
that
matter
for
the
alabama
supreme
court
to
open
pandora's
box
if
we
might
call
it
that
and
look
into
the
decisions
of
the
labor
board
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
labor
board
decisions
properly
applied
by
the
alabama
courts
to
determine
their
own
jurisdiction
would
have
held
that
this
particular
employer
was
a
single
employer
or
whether
or
not
it
--
and
other
employers
that
were
so
related
would
be
considered
for
one,
for
jurisdictional
purposes.
in
connection
with
that
in
the
pleadings
and
we
think
that's
important.
on
page
6
of
the
record,
paragraph
2
of
the
plead
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
actually
foreclosed
in
the
alabama
courts
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
was
an
employer
alone
within
the
jurisdiction
or
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
in
other
companies
that
had
a
similar
stock
ownership
was
the
employer
because
in
the
plead
to
the
jurisdiction
the
petitioner
here
admits
the
complainant's
broadcast
service
of
mobile
is
an
employer
within
the
meaning
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended.
now,
had
they
wanted
to
prove
to
the
court
or
properly
raise
the
issue
in
the
alabama
court,
they
should
have
plead
that
the
respondent
there
and
the
petitioner
here
was
not
an
employer
within
the
meaning
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
the
real
employer
was
by
corporation,
what
they
have
urged
all
the
way
through.
but
there
at
the
very
outset
of
the
pleading
we
find
that
they
admit
that
broadcast
service
of
mobile
was
an
employer
within
the
meaning
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
then
it
follows
very
clearly
from
the
evidence
presented
the
broadcast
service
of
mobile
did
not
do
$100,000
worth
of
business
a
year.
that's
not
disputed.
they
were
doing
about
60.
there'd
only
been
in
existence
for
a
very
few
months
--
oh,
actually
for
a
very
few
weeks
when
the
injunction
was
issued.
but
there
you
have
a
question
of
pleading.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
that
is
true,
justice
goldberg.
they
amended
it.
they
didn't
eliminate
the
paragraph
two
that
we
have
referred
to.
they
added
more
to
it
and
perhaps
the
alabama
courts
are
a
little
improper
in
the
way
that
they
don't
look
as
they
do
in
the
federal
courts.
we
have
strict
pleading
in
alabama.
i
don't
personally
like
it.
a
lot
of
the
lawyers
there
don't
like
it.
you
can
get
yourself
into
a
lot
of
trouble
by
the
strict
pleading.
they
perhaps
tried
and
perhaps
this
court
would
consider
that
they
made
a
effort
that
was
strong
enough,
but
we
would
submit
this,
that
if
this
court
made
the
determination
that
they
made
a
strong
enough
effort
and
that
the
laws
of
the
united
states
in
applying
would
also
cover
the
laws
of
pleading
then
the
alabama
supreme
court
should
certainly
have
an
opportunity
to
perform
its
function
in
the
federal
system
and
that
is
for
it
to
pass
upon
the
evidence
that
was
presented
below.
they
get
to
apply
in
the
first
instance
the
rules
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
then
if
it
makes
a
mistake
in
such
application
then
it
would
be
proper
perhaps
for
this
court
to
review
it.
but
the
question
being
reviewed
at
that
time
would
be
whether
or
not
the
alabama
supreme
court
properly
waived
the
evidence
in
the
court
below
and
whether
or
not
the
alabama
supreme
court
properly
applied
to
the
labor
board
and
we
submit
the
decisions
of
the
courts
of
appeal.
now
we
have
two
sets
of
decisions
that
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
they
amended
their
plea
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
--
to
the
jurisdiction
and
expanded
it.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
that
is
correct,
he
dissolved
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
--
his
temporary
injunction.
he
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
--
reversed
himself.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
i
would
assume
that
he
heard
it
on
the
pleadings
when
he
heard
the
case.
if
he
did
so
he
did
not
follow
the
alabama
rule
which
we
say
is
very
straight.
i
have
no
questions
about
the
fact
of
what
he
held
and
having
held
what
he
did
hold
he
must
have
considered
the
evidence
that
was
offered.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
or
we
would
submit
that
he
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
we
think
that
he
went
a
little
--
he
went
far
in
what
he
did
on
the
basis
of
the
pleadings
before
it.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
now,
the
alabama
supreme
court
did
not
purport
the
facts
upon
the
merits
of
the
case
or
actually
upon
the
jurisdiction
of
the
alabama
court
because
they
specifically
said
that
they
did
not
pass
upon
the
merits.
with
respect
to
the
jurisdiction
they
cited
in
the
case
they
relied
on
was
strictly
a
case
of
pleading.
they
say
every
intent
(inaudible),
the
jurisdiction
must
be
given
on
a
court
or
general
jurisdiction
in
the
state.
and
they
sent
it
back
on
a
case
which
clearly
referred
only
to
pleading
as
distinguished
from
looking
at
the
facts.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
now
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
they'd
--
the
right
--
though
--
the
case
that
we
relied
on
for
that
in
the
--
it's
the
same
case
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
relied
on.
oh,
it's
one
of
the
carriage
cases
i
believe.
it's
a
case
involving
the
teamsters
union
wherein
there
again
there
was
a
question
of
pleading
and
they
held
that
the
plea
to
the
jurisdiction
was
not
proper.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
oh,
its
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
well,
we
are
looking
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
that
is
correct.
they
also
held
that
what
they
are
saying
mr.
justice
goldberg
is
the
pleadings
didn't
put
it
in
issue.
they
go
right
before
that
on
page
409
or
in
the
first
full
paragraph.
it
is
equally
clear
that
the
law
of
this
state
is
settled
to
the
effect
that
every
reasonable
intendment
not
contradicted
by
the
face
of
the
pleadings
will
be
made
in
favor
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
circuit
court.
and
that's
where
we
say
you
go
back
to
paragraph
2
where
they
admit
a
judicial
admission
if
you
please.
if
they
admit
that
the
broadcast
service
of
mobile
is
an
employer,
the
broadcast
service
of
mobile
is
the
employer,
there
is
no
other
employer.
now
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
no,
the
labor
board
would
not
dismiss
the
charge
on
that
but
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
we
don't
--
we
think
it's
a
practice
of
procedure.
we
do
not
think
that
is
the
determining
factor
in
this
case.
it
might
be
on
this
partic
--
it
could
be
argued
on
this
particular
point.
actually,
we
believe
that
had
the
labor
board
considered
the
matters
or
had
any
court
considered
it
in
view
of
the
labor
board
decisions,
if
the
labor
board
decisions
adequately
support
the
fact
that
the
labor
board
itself
would
not
have
taken
jurisdiction
over
this
matter
and
we
--
but
for
ourselves
particularly
on
the
decisions
of
the
courts
of
appeal
wherein
the
issue
of
what
a
joint
employer
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
has
had
quite
a
bit
of
discussion.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
that's
a
separate
point.
the
procedural
point
but
even
on
the
procedural
point
if
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
major
--
made
a
mistake
procedure
wise
then
under
those
circumstances
we
would
submit
that
it
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
record
or
in
view
of
what
the
law
is
rather
than
what
it
applied
if
it
made
that
mistake.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
well,
we
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
we
substantially
based
that
decision
on
what
the
pleadings
set
forth
and
of
course
we
don't
know
what
basis
they
actually
decided
it
on
but
that
appears
to
be
appropriate.
we
frankly
argued
the
other
issues
before
the
court
and
we
would
have
been
very
happy
for
them
to
have
ruled
on
and
we
wish
that
they
had
on
an
ultimate
ground
but
of
course
they
did
not.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
we
don't
think
anyone
could
waive
the
jurisdiction
of
the
labor
board.
the
labor
board
either
--
would've
either
had
jurisdiction
or
it
would
not
have
had
it.i
don't
think
you
could
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
mr.
justice
black
we
would
think
that
neither
party
could
waive
it
or
perhaps
the
alabama
supreme
court
should,
as
we
say
we
argued
it
before
them.
should've
gone
further
and
considered
that
matter.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
but
it's
not
a
question
of
waiving.
now,
it's
possible
that
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
we
would
think
that
as
a
procedural
matter
that
the
court
of
alabama
if
their
procedural
rules
are
reasonable
and
they
are
properly
applied
that
a
party
of
litigating
a
federal
question
in
the
state
court
would
have
to
follow
the
state
procedure
as
long
as
it
was
not
unreasonable.
now
here
the
basis
of
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
we
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
litigated
in
the
alabama
supreme
court
and
in
the
alabama
supreme
court
--
the
respondent
here
had
two
arguments.
one
was
that
the
--
that
under
the
interpretation
of
14
(c)
(1)
when
it
referred
to
a
class
or
category
of
employers
that
meant
what
it
said
it
was
not
proper
to
go
beyond
at
least
what
the
act
itself
said
as
to
a
class
or
category
of
employers
that
it
would
be
improper
to
look
into
the
business
of
these
alleged
affiliated
organizations.
now
we
think
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
did
apply
federal
law.
it
may
have
misapplied
federal
law.
but
nonetheless
we
think
that
it
did
apply
federal
law
and
we
certainly
your
honor
aruge
(inaudible)
cited
federal
law
insofar
as
to
the
interpretation
of
14
(c)
was
concerned
but
we
also
relied
on
state
law
insofar
as
the
raising
of
the
federal
issue
was
concerned
in
the
state
court
that
we
think
that
perhaps
they
failed
to
properly
raise
the
federal
issues.
now
when
the
case
was
remanded
by
the
alabama
supreme
court
or
under
te
alabama
pleading
rules
they
would've
had
an
opportunity
to
go
in
and
replead
that
a
--
at
that
time
after
having
the
decision
of
the
alabama
supreme
court
could
have
pled
properly.
at
least
whether
properly
or
improperly
they
could
have
plead
it
as
the
alabama
supreme
court
says
they
should
have
plead
it
if
they
wanted
to
raise
the
issue
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
--
but
they
did
not
do
it.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
but
we
think
there
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
oh,
that
would
not
have
changed
our
argument
mr.
justice
black
because
we
would
say
that
the
state
court
in
the
first
instance
had
a
right
and
the
duty
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
federal
statute
or
the
federal
law
was
applicable.
what
we
have
here
is
a
effort
by
the
congress
to
eliminate
the
no
man's
land
that
was
created
and
congress
had
said
that
where
the
labor
board
declines
to
assert
jurisdiction
nothing
in
the
act
in
substance
will
prevent
the
state
court
from
asserting
jurisdiction.
well,
the
way
the
act
itself
is
written
it
is
obvious
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
send
the
case
first
to
the
labor
board
but
it
intended
as
the
way
it's
written
for
the
state
court
to
consider
the
applicable
federal
law
and
to
make
the
initial
determination
of
whether
or
not
the
labor
board
had
declined
to
assert
jurisdiction
of
the
particular
type
of
case
that
was
there
before
the
board,
there
before
the
court.
and
we
think
that
the
state
court
would
always
be
required
under
any
such
law
to
determine
its
own
jurisdiction.
of
course
in
doing
that
it
would
have
to
apply
federal
law.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
well,
no
your
honor.
we
do
not
think
that
because
we
do
not
think
that
the
arguable
task
of
this
court
applies
to
a
case
under
14
(c).
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
if
you
leave
the
arguable
test
in,
you
had
--
still
have
a
no
man's
land
because
whenever
you
get
a
closed
case
the
state
court
deny.
whether
the
labor
board
will
or
will
not
act
would
take
a
long
period
of
time
as
the
parties
are
not
going
to
know
what
the
law
is
during
that
period
of
time.
we
think
that
if
the
case
is
arguable
the
argument
must
be
made
to
the
state
court
and
the
state
court
applying
the
federal
decisions
of
the
federal
courts
of
appeals
or
this
court
and
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
would
make
the
determination
of
whether
it
had
jurisdiction
to
proceed.
and
then
after
it
had
made
a
final
determination
of
course
if
it
made
a
mistake
it
could
have
been
appealed
to
this
court.
you
have
the
--
you
may
even
have
the
situation
where
the
courts
would
differ.
you
have
been
(inaudible)
of
a
case
below
where
the
national
labor
relations
board
considered
the
labor
dispute
that
they
held
there
was
no
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4).
along
came
a
jury
trial
(inaudible)
--
both
cases
were
appealed
to
the
same
circuit
court
and
the
jury
disagreed
with
the
labor
board
and
they
awarded
substantial
damages
to
the
employer
but
you
had
two
different
fact
finding
agencies.
in
here
the
act
specifically
says
that
nothing
in
the
act
shall
prevent
the
state
court
from
asserting
jurisdiction.
we
think
that
is
another
confusion
that
we
have
here
is
that
--
or
the
words
that
are
used
in
the
statute
had
said.
the
statute
says
(inaudible)
--
refers
to
a
labor
dispute.
the
solicitor
general
cox
had
said
in
an
article
that
he
wrote
while
he
was
a
professor
at
harvard
law
school,
the
question
is
probably
made
more
difficult
by
the
fact
of
a
bad
choice
of
words
on
the
part
of
congress.
the
congress
used
labor
dispute
or
perhaps
what
they
should
have
used
was
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
or
a
representation
proceeding
and
that
explains
the
case
that
much
puzzled
us
involved
here,
the
jemcon
broadcasting
company
case.
there
a
petition
was
filed
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
concerning
a
radio
station
in
mobile,
alabama.
the
national
labor
relations
board
said
they
didn't
do
a
$100,000
worth
of
business
so
they
dismissed
it.
so
the
union
put
up
a
picket
line
and
the
company
went
in
and
obtained
the
state
court
injunction.
it
didn't
look
like
you
could
be
much
clearer
because
we
had
the
decision
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
saying
they
would
not
exert
jurisdiction
over
the
station.
then
they
asked
for
one
of
these
advisory
opinions
and
of
course
had
the
petition,
they
didn't
want
to
do
the
advisory
opinion
they
could
have
asked
for
it
from
the
board.
they
asked
one
advisory
opinion
and
the
labor
board
comes
along
and
says,
"we
will
assert
jurisdiction
because
they
wrote
to
some
advertiser,
the
delchamps
which
was
an
advertising
company
and
they
would
have
asserted
jurisdiction
over
delchamps".
so
what
happens
next?
a
union
who
had
come
here
and
organized
the
employees
spent
in
this
labor
dispute
filed
a
petition
with
the
board
and
they
say,
"we'll
hold
an
election
for
us".
then
the
board
had
said
it
will
assert
jurisdiction.
what
did
they
say
when
they
filed
that
petition,
it
the
board
itself
that
said,
they
said,
"we
will
never
assert
jurisdiction
because
there's
not
a
$100,000
worth
of
business
involved",
and
they
cited
their
own
advisory
opinion
which
showed
that
the
board
evidently
applies
the
same
criteria
that
the
question
of
a
labor
dispute
--
they
don't
look
at
it
as
a
labor
dispute
they
look
at
it
as
a
question
of
whether
or
not
it's
a
representation
question
or
whether
or
not
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice
question.
frankly
it
looks
hard
to
understand
what
the
board
had
done
in
that
particular
case
because
it
did
appeal
very
inconsistent
but
once
you
--
if
you
use
professor
cox's
definition
of
what
labor
dispute
means
in
the
act
you'd
come
out
with
something
that
at
least
you
can
understand
what
the
volatility
that.
with
the
respect
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction
here,
this
case
is
quite
different
from
the
construction
in
general
labor
union
case
for
this
reason.
we
don't
think
that
anyone
before
this
court
including
the
united
states
doubts
that
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
had
a
right
to
determine
its
own
jurisdiction
under
section
14
(c).
in
the
construction
in
general
labor
union
case
the
court
was
particularly
careful
to
point
out
that
the
issue
for
review
there
did
not
pass
upon
the
question
of
whether
the
court
had
erroneously
performed
its
function
and
under
the
federal
law
the
only
question
there
was
whether
the
court
had
any
power
whatsoever
to
make
the
determination.
under
14
(c)
here
the
state
court
had
the
power
and
the
duty
to
make
the
determination,
the
question
of
whether
it
correctly
made
it
and
therefore
we
would
submit
the
general
labor
union
would
not
apply.
and
that
what
would
apply
would
be
the
general
rule
that
this
court
will
not
take
a
piecemeal
appeal
or
--
and
the
case
is
not
properly
here.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
this
particular
case?
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
we
submit
that
it
has
none
for
this
reason.
the
secondary
boycott
provision
of
this
case
is
set
forth.
the
union
came
in
and
they
said,
we
contacted
and
we
wrote
all
of
these
people
who
were
perspective
advertisers
over
this
--
over
this
radio
station".
there's
definite
evidence
with
respect
to
one
hams
(ph)
which
was
in
the
retail
appliance
business,
hams'
jurisdiction,
or
hams
does
not
meet
the
jurisdictional
requirements
of
the
board
because
it's
a
retail
enterprise
and
he
did
substantially
less
than
$500,000
worth
of
business
a
year.
with
respect
to
the
delchamps
that
they
wrote
to
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
delchamps
ever
advertised
over
this
radio
station.
if
you
want
to
take
their
secondary
boycott
provisions
and
have
an
elimination
of
state
jurisdiction
or
what
the
union
here
contends
it
would
be
very
easily
to
do
because
if
you
take
a
blind
man
with
a
small
concession
in
a
post
office
or
perhaps
we
ought
to
get
him
away
from
the
united
states
to
keep
that
from
being
involved
he
is
going
to
buy
his
goods
from
someone
on
a
national
basis
although
his
purchases
would
be
very
small.
if
the
union
can
destroy
state
jurisdiction
by
merely
writing
a
letter
to
someone
from
whom
he
buys
or
if
you
please,
from
someone
he
might
buy
from
because
it's
not
shown
that
these
people
that
they
rely
upon
would
get
themselves.
the
act
had
shown
that
the
people
they
rely
upon
did
business
with
the
station
then
you
would
eliminate
easily
the
entire
section
14
(c).
it
would
be
a
very
unusual
situation
where
the
union
in
any
case
could
just
write
one
letter
to
a
supplier,
a
potential
supplier
or
a
potential
customer
and
thereby
destroy
the
state
court's
jurisdiction.
the
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
what
the
solicitor
general
says
and
they
support
their
position
that
they
would
take
jurisdiction.
we
don't
think
that
that
means
that
the
board
itself
if
it
considered
that
it
would
take
jurisdiction
i'm
sure
that
the
matter
did
not
go
for
--
go
before
the
board.
there
was
no
opportunity
to
argue
it
before
the
board.
they
cite
cases
saying
if
they
would
take
jurisdiction
we
submit
that
even
on
the
basis
of
the
cases
that
they
cite
that
we
have
referred
to
each
of
those
in
our
brief
that
they
are
quite
different
from
the
case
that
we
have
here.
we
must
--
in
looking
at
what
the
board
would
do
under
the
board's
decisions
we
must
consider
that
there
are
two
sides
of
a
coin.
under
some
businesses
which
are
related,
the
board
would
take
jurisdiction.
and
under
other
businesses
that
were
related,
the
board
would
not
take
jurisdiction.
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
we
submit
that
the
--
or
under
the
method
in
which
the
labor
board
has
established
the
general
counsel
is
a
separate
department
or
a
separate
and
independent
agent
insofar
as
the
board
is
concerned.
i
don't
think
that
the
solicitor
of
the
board
is
there
and
we
would
hardly
submit
that
if
the
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
the
general
counsel,
he
initially
answers
to
the
full
complaint
and
he
would
make
the
initial
determination
except
that
it's
the
general
counsel's
employees
under
delegated
authority
that
make
the
initial
determinations.
and
we
of
course
would
expect
the
court
to
consider
what
was
said
by
the
solicitor
general
but
we
would
not
consider
that
this
court
would
be
bound
by
what
was
said
by
the
solicitor
general.
if
we
did
that
we
would
be
in
the
position
of
someone
else
making
a
decision
of
where
the
parties
to
be
affected
by
the
decision
were
not
even
before
the
particular
party
involved
and
had
no
opportunity
to
present
their
views.
we
have
a
dispute
--
disputed
questions
of
fact
here
that
must
be
decided
by
someone
initially.
going
to
the
labor
board
decisions
which
in
sub
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
the
test
is
a
jurisdictional
test,
not
--
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
merits
--
mr.
willis
c.
darby,
jr.
--
before
the
board.
we
make
no
argument
as
to
what
the
board
would
do
with
the
case.
we
do
make
an
argument
that
the
alabama
supreme
court
on
the
basis
of
the
board
and
court
decisions
was
justified
or
would
be
justified
and
so
would
this
court,
if
this
court
undertakes
to
reach
the
--
this
--
reach
that
point
would
be
justified
in
the
holding
that
the
alabama
court
had
jurisdiction.
what
the
labor
board
in
its
own
annual
report
and
they
have
not
retracted
it
they
say
this
question
turns
on
the
sufficiency
of
integration
of
the
amount
of
integration
between
the
various
companies
involved.
they
rely
on
four
principal
factors.
one
is
interrelation
of
operations
which
means
in
substance
that
one
company
sales
of
purchases
from
the
other
or
along
the
same
lines
that
controls
the
source
of
the
other's
business
where
it
can
close
it
up
if
it
wants
to.
now
they
rely
primarily
here
on
some
kind
of
control.
or
in
any
case
where
you
have
a
subsidiary
and
in
any
case
where
you
have
a
pers
--
well,
one
person
owns
a
stock
in
a
company,
he
obviously
has
control
over
it.
but
the
labor
board
does
not
see
him
fit
to
rely
on
that
and
where
it
has,
the
courts
of
appeal
have
reversed
it.
there's
a
larger
question
involved
here
insofar
as
commerce
is
concerned
and
that
is
a
question
of
what
is
going
to
happen
if
a
secondary
boycott
is
involved.
and
congress
sought
to
draw
the
line
narrowly
with
respect
to
a
secondary
boycott
if
all
of
these
employers
or
one,
the
jurisdictional
purposes,
certainly
there
would
be
one,
a
secondary
boycott
purposes.
under
such
circumstances
we
presume
if
that
was
true
the
union
could
put
his
picket
lines
up
around
all
four
of
the
stations
if
it
wanted.
that
would
be
quite
contrary
to
what
congress
intended
because
congress
on
8
(b)
(4)
attempted
to
draw
the
line
narrowly
and
to
keep
one
employer's
business
from
affecting
another
insofar
as
a
labor
dispute
was
concerned.
in
the
courts
of
appeals
where
they
have
reviewed
them
the
matter
or
particularly
on
those
secondary
boycott
cases
they
have
held
in
situations
similar
to
the
one
that
we
have
here
that
there
is
no
one
employer
rather
than
several
and
it's
a
secondary
boycott
provisions
would
apply
certainly
that
was
the
intent
of
the
congress.
here,
if
the
court
said
put
them
all
together,
that
means
that
the
union
with
a
dispute
with
one
can
certainly
in
this
record
it's
not
been
shown
how
that
dispute
affected
any
of
the
other
stations.
but
the
union
with
the
dispute
to
one
that
take
after
all
--
after
before
them.
we
submit
first
if
the
alabama
supreme
court
made
a
mistake
in
applying
federal
law
that
the
case
should
be
returned
to
that
court
so
that
it
might
in
the
first
instance
examine
the
evidence
to
determine
what
the
evidence
was
first
or
the
facts
in
the
case
were
and
then
apply
labor
board
and
court
of
appeal
decisions
to
that
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
would
have
jurisdiction
under
14
(c).
we
further
submit
that
if
this
court
determines
to
consider
the
merits
of
the
action
and
that
is
to
analyze
the
evidence
in
the
record
to
make
an
initial
determination
on
what
that
evidence
meant
and
in
that
event
on
the
cases
that
we
have
cited
and
we've
referred
to
quite
a
number
of
them
in
many
recent
cases
involving
dissent
from
members
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
the
dissents
at
least
say
that
so
far
as
the
board
is
concerned
the
board
still
looks
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
has
been
interchange
of
employees
at
the
same
working
conditions
in
the
various
places
something
that
everyone
admits
is
not
here.
the
trial
court
found
that
the
day
to
day
operations
were
controlled
completely
by
the
manager
of
the
radio
station.
anyone
that
owns
a
small
business
is
going
looking
on
it
every
now
and
then
no
matter
who
he
has
for
the
manager
to
see
that
its
running
right.
and
if
he
is
not
the
type
of
man
that
will
speak
to
the
employees
then
it
would
be
most
unusual.
but
the
day
to
day
operations,
the
operations
relied
on
by
the
courts
of
appeal
and
by
the
labor
board
in
most
of
their
cases
is
admittedly
run
by
the
manager
of
the
station.
and
the
stations
do
not
have
any
interrelationship
in
any
form
whatsoever
that
the
board
has
relied
upon
and
we
submit
that
if
the
court
considered
the
facts
of
the
case
that
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
properly
applied
that
the
labor
board
would
not
have
asserted
jurisdiction
and
this
employer
belongs
to
one
of
that
class
wherein
the
states
were
free
to
act
and
apply
state
law.
thank
you.
