do
you
think
if
both
plea

parties
together
could
waive
the
jurisdiction
of
the

justice

are
you
not
--
factually
basing
your
point,
the
waiver
by
saying
if
they
file
a
second

court
didn't
give
any
--
paid
attention
to
this
second
statement
about

of
the

but
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
a
federal
question
or
state
question
as
to
whether
the
courts
of
alabama
can
refuse
to
consider
the
record
that
what
facts
that
are
shown
on
the
record
that
would
show
that
the
labor
board
has
jurisdiction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
question
here
is
whether
they
could
litigate
that
federal
question
in
a
state
court
or
whether
they
could
litigate
it
at
all
--
justice
hugo
l.

--
by
the
record.

those
have
--
been
a
federal
statute
that
a
state
court
shall
not
try
any
cases
that
the
record
shows
that
the
labor
board
have
jurisdiction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
have
changed
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
not
think
or
do
you
think
that
the
state
court
have
to
consider
this
case
on
the
basis
--
the
same
basis
that
it
would
has
been
the
federal
statute
which
says
it's
--
if
this
arguably
goes
before
the
labor
board,
you
have
no
jurisdiction.
