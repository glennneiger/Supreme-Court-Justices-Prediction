justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
the
--
the
trial
court
here
did
determine
that
it
happens
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
as
i
read
this
record,
you
filed
an
original
complaint
and
they
filed
a
plea
to
the
jurisdiction,
and
then
you
filed
an
amended
complaint,
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
they
filed
an
amended
plea
to
the
jurisdiction.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
plea
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
it
--
then
the
matter
went
to
trial
on
the
amended
pleadings,
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
the
chancellor
who
heard
the
evidence
held
that
the
labor
board
--
that
the
labor
act
preempted
the
case
and
he
declined
to
issue
the
--
or
he
--
the
client
issued
the
injunction.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(voice
overlap)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
he
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
and
he
did
not
therefore
hold
the
pleadings
were
improper.
the
issue
was
tried
and
presented
to
him
and
the
facts
were
then
planted,
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
because
otherwise
if
he
ought
to
consider
was
the
original
plea
he
would've
had
to
go
against
under
the
labor
board
jurisdictional
rule
who
had
the
rule
against
the
plea.
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
where
did
you
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
where
do
you
read
the
alabama
supreme
court
the
hold
that
they
disregarded
the
amended
jurisdictional
plea
because
of
state
pleading
(voice
overlap)?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
i
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
maybe
i
read
the
decision
wrongly
but
if
you
look
at
page
409,
i
do
not
read
that
it
indicate
they
were
passing
on
a
matter
of
pleading.
i
read
it
rather
they
indicate
it
that
the
holding
of
the
court
that
the
jurisdictional
rule
of
the
labor
board
that
they
would
respect
is
only
the
$100,000
rule
for
--
by
the
employer.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
that
wrong?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
does
the
labor
board
holds,
suppose
you
file
a
charge
against
the
employer
such
as
here
and
then
you
in
support
of
that
charge
and
jurisdiction
proved
that
that
employer
is
part
of
an
integrated
larger
operation.
does
the
labor
board
dismiss
the
charge
because
you
have
not
brought
the
other
employer
in?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
isn't
that
the
determining
factor
then
in
this
case?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
is
a
separate
point.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
difficulty
is
i
think
and
perhaps
maybe
i'm
not
reading
the
illinois
--
the
alabama
supreme
court
correctly.
the
difficulty
is
that
if
you
read
this
opinion
i
think
all
that
it
says
is
that
since
the
plea
of
the
union
did
not
show
that
this
particular
employer,
the
employer
(inaudible)
did
business
of
more
than
a
$100,000,
that
the
other
evidence
that
was
offered
and
the
other
plea
was
irrelevant
by
the
court's
standing.
and
of
course
your
opponent
says
that
the
court
had
no
right
to
say
that
under
the
preemption
doctrine.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
that
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
as
i
understand
this
(inaudible)
this
case
to
the
question
of
whether
the
(inaudible)
argue
the
rule
--
applies
in
this
situation,
it's
all
--
you
say
that
on
the
face
of
it,
it's
clear
that
the
board
had
jurisdiction.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes
sir,
i
think
it
is.
but
i
think
the
proper
rule
is
on
the
section
14
(c)
that
if
it
is
palpably
clear
that
this
labor
board
under
existing
rules
of
decision
or
publish
rules,
the
rules
of
decision
are
all
we
have
would
not
assert
jurisdiction.
the
state
courts
have
the
authority
to
so
determine
and
to
assert
jurisdiction.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it's
palpably
clear
that
the
labor
board
would
assert
jurisdiction
the
state
court
would
be
obligated
as
a
matter
of
law
to
so
find
but
in
any
situation
where
it
is
arguable
that
the
labor
board
would
assert
jurisdiction
on
the
basis
of
reasonable
judicial
argument
then
i
think
it's
incumbent
on
the
state
court
as
this
court
said
in
the
garmon
case
to
yield
to
the
primary
competence
of
the
board
and
let
the
board
have
an
opportunity
to
rule
on
a
case
to
case
basis.
i
don't
think
the
court
ought
to
abdicate
its
judicial
responsibility
as
the
wisconsin
court
in
the
harron
(ph)
case
almost
did.
that's
now
pending
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
here.
but
i
think
where
it's
arguable
that
the
labor
board
does
have
jurisdiction
then
the
court
should
yield
to
the
primary
competence
of
the
board.
thank
you
sirs.
