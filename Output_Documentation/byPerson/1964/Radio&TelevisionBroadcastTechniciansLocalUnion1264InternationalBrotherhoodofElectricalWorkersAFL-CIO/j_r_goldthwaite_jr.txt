yes,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,

your
honors,
this
case
i
believe
to
involve
the
first
occasion
upon
which
this
court
has
been
called
upon
to
construe
section
14
(c)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
amended
by
the
landrum-griffin
act
in
1959.
that
section
provides
that
specifically
that
the
labor
board
may
--
by
rule
of
decision
or
published
rules
to
decline
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
any
class
of
employers
which
it
finds
does
not
sufficiently
affect
interstate
commerce
to
warrant
the
assertion
of
its
jurisdiction
provided
that
the
board
may
not
reduce
its
jurisdictional
standards
beyond
those
which
existed
on
august
1,
1959,
that
is
the
narrow
--
the
scope
of
the
jurisdiction
which
it
will
exercise.
in
section
14
(c)
(2),
congress
provided
that
in
any
case
in
which
sub
--
under
the
provisions
of
section
14
(c)
(1),
the
national
labor
relations
act
declined
to
exercise
its
jurisdictions.
the
state
courts
and
boards
could
assert
state
jurisdiction
to
regulate
conduct
involved.
in
this
particular
case,
the
respondent
is
a
radio
station
and
by
its
nature
of
course,
radio
stations
affect
commerce
or
licensed
by
the
federal
communications
commission,
and
as
result
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
statutory
jurisdiction
over
all
labor's
--
all
radio
stations.
in
this
case,
the
respondent
purchased
the
assets
of
radio
stations
waip
on
the
outskirts
of
mobile,
alabama
laid
off
two
employees
who
were
represented
by
the
petitioner
for
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
terminated
them
and
--
waip
terminated
them,
and
the
respondent,
they
are
so
later
commenced
operating
the
radio
station
with
new
employees.
the
union
immediately
contacted
the
new
station
wsim
and
requested
that
they
employ
one
of
the
employees
who
had
been
employed
by
waip
as
a
radio
technician,
the
full
time
employee.
it
also
requested
that
the
respondent,
wsim
observed
union
working
conditions
which
have
been
established
in
collective
bargaining
agreements
with
other
radio
stations
in
mobile
by
signing
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
these
discussions
didn't
work
out
so
as
result
to
which
the
union
put
a
picket
line
on
the
radio
station
of
the
respondent
and
began
to
solicit
advertises
by
word
of
mouth
and
by
letter
to
seize
patronizing
the
respondent
and
to
patronize
rather
or
place
their
advertisement
with
union
stations.
the
picket
lines
--
the
picket
signs
stated
that
radio
station
wsim
is
non-union
and
signed
by
the
union.
that's
the
only
thing
that
was
on
the
sign.
about
10
days
after
the
picket
line
was
established,
the
respondent
applied
to
the
circuit
court
in
mobile
for
an
injunction
against
all
of
the
activity
which
is
being
pursuit
by
the
union.
and
an
ex
parte
hearing
was
held,
an
ex
parte
hearing
of
course
is
a
sort
of
an
anomaly
but
the
court
rather
than
issue
an
ex
parte
injunction,
called
the
parties
info
--
an
informal
conference.
at
that
time,
the
union
filed
a
plead
to
the
jurisdiction
based
on
federal
preemption
and
which
it
asserted
that
its
secondary
activity
so
substantially
affected
interstate
commerce
as
to
give
the
national
labor
relations
board
jurisdiction.
the
trial
court
at
that
hearing
found
that
the
acts
which
will
be
engaged
in
by
the
union
violated
the
alabama
law,
the
state's
right-to-work
act
and
a
boycott
statute
which
alabama
has
and
issued
a
temporary
injunctions.
subsequently,
the
union
filed
an
amendment
to
its
plea
to
the
jurisdiction
in
which
it
asserted
that
radio
station
wsim
was
one
of
a
chain
of
four
commonly
owned
and
controlled
radio
stations
known
as
the
holt
broadcasting
service
which
were
--
an
integrated
financial
enterprise
within
the
rules
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
which
affected
commerce
that
is
which
did
a
gross
volume
of
business
in
excess
of
$100,000
per
year
and
that
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
for
this
reason
would
assert
jurisdiction
over
matters
of
labor
relations
as
concerns
anyone
of
the
stations
in
the
chain.
this
plea
was
filed
along
with
other
defensive
pleas
and
answer
and
it
came
to
be
heard
along
with
the
other
defensive
pleadings
on
the
merits
at
the
time
of
trial.
the
trial
courts
sustained
the
plea.
he
entered
--
he
permitted
full
evidence
as
to
the
operations,
the
ownership,
the
operation,
the
control
and
all
other
factors
insofar
as
we
were
able
to
present
evidence
to
be
introduced
and
following
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
which
is
i
say
was
the
final
trial,
the
trial
court
found
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
would
assert
jurisdiction
over
the
operations
of
the
respondent
as
one
of
the
chain
of
integrated
radio
stations
which
substantially
affected
interstate
commerce
and
he
dismissed
the
petition.
the
respondent
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
which
reversed,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
first
pointed
out
that
the
respondent
as
an
individual
radio
station
did
not
do
1,000
--
$100,000
in
gross
business
each
year
and
therefore,
the
board
would
not
assert
jurisdiction
over
the
respondent
as
an
independent
business.
however,
we
urge
there,
as
we
do
here,
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
had
previously
issued
rules
of
decision
in
which
it
held
that
integrated
financial
operations
in
which
there
are
four
elements
present,
an
interrelation
of
operations,
centralized
control
labor
relations,
common
management
and
common
ownership
or
financial
control
would
be
considered
as
a
single
employer
for
jurisdictional
purposes
by
the
labor
board
and
it
therefore,
the
board
would
assert
jurisdiction
as
the
trial
court
had
held.
in
that
connection,
the
evidence
in
this
case
show
that
the
stock
in
all
four
of
the
radio
corporations
was
owned
by
mr.
holt,
his
wife
mrs.
holt,
a
vice-president,
there
were
three
stockholders
who
all
owned
all
of
the
stock
in
the
four
radio
corporations
and
mr.
holt
was
the
majority
stockholder.
mr.
holt
also
was
the
sole
owner
of
a
service
corporation
which
provoke
--
performed
accounting
and
other
managerial
services
for
the
four
radio
stations.
mr.
holt
was
the
president
of
three
of
the
radio
corporations
and
of
the
service
corporation.
his
wife
was
either
secretary
or
vice-president
of
--
of
three
of
the
radio
corporations
and
of
the
service
corporation.
the
other
vice-president
who
owned
a
minority
interest
in
three
of
the
stations
and
who
had
no
interest
in
the
service
corporation
was
president
of
the
montgomery
alabama
radio
station
and
also
manager
of
that
station.
he
was
vice-president
of
the
mobile
station
and
of
the
hattiesburg
mississippi
station.
the
treasurer
of
all
five
corporations
was
also
the
manager
and
executive
officer
of
the
service
corporation.
the
service
corporation,
the
treasurer,
mr.
likzy
(ph)
came
to
mobile
at
least
once
every
two
weeks
or
usually
once
every
two
weeks
and
directly
supervised
the
keeping
of
the
books,
the
collection
of
accounts
and
delinquent
accounts
and
all
other
matters
pertaining
to
the
financial
operation
of
the
business.
he
also
made
the
appraisal
of
waip
station
properties
at
the
time
the
station
was
purchased
by
wsim.
he
also
participated
in
the
discussions
which
were
held
with
the
union
with
respect
to
the
employing
of
the
technician
who
had
been
terminated
by
station
waip
and
the
execution
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
was
shown
that
mr.
holt
and
mr.
robinson,
the
vice-president
employed
all
station
managers
and
all
of
the
engineering
personnel
for
the
stations.
they
also
themselves,
as
officers
of
the
corporations,
employed
the
national
advertising
representative
to
represent
two
of
the
stations,
mobile
and
montgomery
as
i
recall.
the
other
stations
had
no
national
advertising
representative.
mr.
holt,
the
president
of
the
company
concerned
himself
primarily
with
the
sales
of
the
company
and
he
also
visited
each
station
usually
about
every
two
weeks,
and
while
there,
he
discussed
with
each
salesman
the
conduct
of
his
work,
the
manner
in
which
he
tried
to
sell,
his
diligence,
the
policy
and
method
of
selling
which
he
recommended,
he
discussed
with
the
disc
jockeys,
the
manner
in
which
they
did
their
announcing
and
how
they
played
their
records
and
all
the
other
details
of
the
management
of
the
business.
the
station
manager
in
mobile
testified
that
he
was
in
almost
daily
contact
with
mr.
robinson
and
that
he
also
had
contacts
with
mr.
holt.
there
was
some
interchange
of
employees,
for
instance
the
technician
with
which
--
station
wsim
began
operations
after
it
was
purchased
by
waip
was
a
technician
from
the
montgomery
radio
station
who
was
temporarily
assigned
to
work
in
mobile.
there
was
also
a
showing
that
some
radio
equipment,
the
testing
equipment,
tape
recorders
and
other
equipment
was
transferred
back
and
forth
from
montgomery
and
mobile.
on
a
whole,
in
summary,
the
evidence
under
the
decisions
--
or
more
current
decisions
which
have
been
issued
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
the
last
five
or
six
years
demonstrated
with
--
quite
clearly
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
would
assume
jurisdiction
over
the
labor
relations
of
the
station
as
a
part
of
an
integrated
operation.
these
cases
were
urged
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
we
urge
that
they
follow
these
decisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
the
board's
integrated
enterprise
standard
of
jurisdiction.
the
court
however,
said
this,
“appellee
argues
that
affiliated
enterprises
of
the
majority
and
controlling
stockholders
of
appellant
should
be
considered
by
the
board
for
determining
whether
the
jurisdictional
standards
are
met
and
insists
that
the
court
must
base
its
jurisdiction
on
a
consideration
of
what
the
board
would
do
under
the
facts
of
this
case
and
that
in
any
event
the
case
must
first
be
submitted
to
that
body.
we
cannot
agree.
we
have
recently
stated
that,
according
on
other
case,
the
authority
is
clear
to
the
effect
that
every
court
of
general
jurisdiction
has
judicial
power
to
determine
the
question
of
its
own
jurisdiction.”
now,
we
don't
challenge
in
this
case
the
power
of
a
state
court
of
the
authority
of
a
state
court
of
general
jurisdiction
to
make
a
judicial
determination
of
its
own
jurisdiction.
our
preposition
is
that
in
making
that
determination,
the
state
court
must
look
to
the
rules
of
jurisdiction
established
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
must
be
governed
by
the
rules
of
law
established
by
congress
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
rules
of
decision
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
determine
that
--
the
trial
court
found
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
reversed
and
said,
“we
won't
--
we
won't
consider
or
will
decide
which
cases
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
we
think
are
worthy
of
consideration
and
we'll
put
the
ones
the
union
relies
on
aside
and
pay
no
attention
to
those”,
that's
exactly
the
effect
of
what
they
said.
they
said,
“we
don't
agree”.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
your
jurisdiction?
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
no
sir,
i
don't.
i
didn't
intend
to
address
myself
to
that
if
necessary
but
i
do
not
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
alright
sir.
shall
i
conclude
now
and
continue
tomorrow
or?
thank
you.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
with
respect
to
the
finality
of
the
judgment
in
this
case,
i
pointed
out
in
my
argument
yesterday
mr.
justice
harlan
that
this
case
was
tried
at
final
trial.
the
only
thing
which
remained
to
be
done
after
it
was
sent
back
to
the
trial
court
was
the
assessment
of
damages.
all
other
issues
had
been
disposed
of.
we
urged
a
federal
preemption
in
putting
all
of
the
evidence
which
was
available
on
federal
preemption
so
far
as
that
federal
question
which
is
the
only
federal
question
in
the
case,
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
was
final
and
under
the
rule
of
this
court
and
common
laborers
against
curry
in
which
your
honor
concurred
especially
this
court
determined
that
where
the
question
of
federal
jurisdiction
was
the
only
federal
question
in
the
case
that
that
could
be
brought
up
prior
to
the
final
disposition
of
the
case
in
the
state
court.
now,
the
case
is
on
appeal
and
is
presently
pending
on
the
assessment
of
damages
on
some
$3000
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
it
cannot
be
tried
before
or
be
argued
there
and
submitted
for
decision
before
sometime
next
month.
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
both
in
injunction
cases
and
in
damage
suits
--
so
where
federal
or
jurisdiction
attaches
to
the
case,
state
courts
are
controlled
by
the
federal
law,
they
--
the
--
in
the
borden
case
in
texas
the
court
held
that
the
state
court
could
not
award
damages
because
the
subject
matter
was
preempted
and
was
within
the
competence
of
the
labor
board.
all
of
those
factors
are
present
here.
a
determination
of
the
jurisdictional
question
will
conclude
all
federal
questions
in
the
case.
additionally,
there
are
some
old
decisions
of
this
court
to
the
effect
that
where
the
only
judicial
act
which
remains
is
the
assessment
of
damages.
the
court
will
go
on
and
review
the
legal
issues
prior
to
the
determination
of
that
semi
administrative
judicial
act.
but
in
any
event,
the
curry
case
i
think
is
determinative
of
the
issue
of
concern
which
you
asked
and
i
don't
think
in
this
case
is
any
occasion
to
--
for
any
cause
for
concern
that
the
curry
case
will
cause
problems
or
to
review
that
issue.
as
i
mentioned
yesterday,
the
congress
in
1959
amended
this
statute
to
provide
the
state
courts
could
take
jurisdiction
when
the
labor
board
had
by
rule
of
decision
or
by
published
rule
declined
to
assert
jurisdiction.
now,
we
pointed
out
to
the
alabama
court
and
proved
that
there
are
cases
of
the
labor
board
which
under
the
facts
of
this
case
would
dictate
that
the
labor
board
affirmatively
has
jurisdiction
over
this
cause
and
controversy.
there
are
some
older
cases
of
the
labor
board
which
were
relied
upon
by
the
respondent
before
the
alabama
court
which
were
decided
prior
to
1958
which
hold
that
there
must
be
interchange
of
employees
between
corporations
and
common
working
conditions
that
is
the
same
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
however,
the
labor
board
abandoned
those
cases
and
that
approach
to
the
integrated
operational
theory
in
1958
before
congress
amended
the
statute
and
in
any
event
the
statute
specifies
that
the
labor
board
may
enlarge
the
area
which
in
its
discretion
it
asserts
jurisdiction,
may
--
it
may
not
narrow
it
at
the
time
of
that
statute.
the
rule
was
that
the
labor
board
would
assert
jurisdiction
and
it
still
has
a
rule
to
more
recent
decisions
do
not
require
interchange
of
employees
or
common
working
conditions
so
long
as
there
is
an
actual
exercise
of
control
by
the
common
ownership
and
management
and
there
is
no
question
about
that
on
this
record.
the
two
owners
control
every
material
decision
and
act
in
matter
of
policy
of
the
chain
of
radio
stations
which
they
call
the
whole
broadcast
service.
now,
where
it
is
shown
that
the
labor
board
has
issued
decisions
to
the
effect
that
it
will
assert
jurisdiction
of
the
controversy,
we
believe
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
did
take
that
the
state
court
should
yield
to
the
competence
of
the
labor
board
and
allow
the
labor
board
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
will
assert
jurisdiction
of
the
particular
controversy.
i
point
out
that
the
statute
says
that
the
board
may
establish
its
rules,
jurisdictional
rules,
the
discretionary
jurisdictional
rules
as
it
respects
the
volume
of
commerce
by
rule
of
decision
or
by
published
rule.
the
congressional
history
while
we
did
not
feel
that
it
was
necessary
because
the
statute
is
palpably
clear
as
to
what
its
intendment
is.
the
congressional
history
indicates
that
some
of
the
congressmen,
at
least
mr.
thompson
i
believe
of
new
jersey,
who
spoke
at
length
on
several
occasions
and
others
spoke
of
a
case
by
case
approach
on
the
part
of
the
labor
board.
which
would
indicate
that
the
term
rule
of
decision
contemplates
that
unless
it
was
palpably
certain
on
the
basis
of
previous
jurisdictional
expressions
of
the
board
that
the
board
would
approach
the
question
of
this
jurisdiction
on
a
case
by
case
basis
wherever
necessary
and
that
if
there
was
any
doubt
as
to
the
question
of
the
board's
jurisdiction
the
state
court
should
yield
and
let
the
board
decide
the
question.
in
furtherance
of
the
statute,
the
board
in
1959
adopted
rules
by
which
it
will
render
advisory
opinions
and
the
rule
specifically
provide
that
either
party
to
a
case
or
a
court
may
apply
to
the
board
foreign
advisory
opinion
as
it
respects
its
jurisdiction
in
any
case
of
controversy
pending
in
a
state
court.
so
that
they'll
--
are
means
whereby
the
state
court
without
dismissing
the
case
could
direct
that
a
determination
of
the
labor
board
be
procured
as
to
the
extent
of
his
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
the
particular
facts
and
issue.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
not
in
this
case
mr.
justice
harlan.
it
seemed
to
us
that
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
board's
rules
applied
and
covered
the
factual
situation
and
we
did
not
feel
that
it
was
necessary
and
that
they
--
neither
the
court
nor
the
respondent
made
any
effort
or
undertook
to
get
the
board
to
make
the
ruling
in
that
respect.
here
it
is
arguable,
it's
more
than
arguable,
it's
clear
it
seems
to
us
that
the
board
does
have
jurisdiction
and
would
assert
jurisdiction
and
that
therefore
the
state
court
should
yield
as
respects
to
jurisdictional
issue
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
case
is
representative
of
those
cases.
the
court
mentions
that
in
labor
cases
the
injunction
is
likely
to
terminated
the
dispute
and
be
determinative
of
the
rights
of
the
parties
without
any
effective
right
of
appeal.
in
this
case
and
in
companion
cases
where
injunctions
have
issued
we
argued
this
case,
it
was
not
argued
but
it
was
submitted
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
in
the
fall
of
1963.
we
argued
a
companion
case
before
this
case
was
submitted
in
which
an
injunction
is
outstanding
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
still
has
not
issued
a
decision
in
that
case.
meanwhile,
the
federal
rights
of
those
people
have
been
completely
subjugated
to
the
alabama
dictate
of
the
injunction.
thank
you
sirs.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
with
respect
to
this
matter
of
pleading
as
i
construe
the
alabama
decision.
what
they
were
saying
was
that
the
only
rule
they
would
rely
upon
was
the
$100,000
single
employer
rule
and
that
any
other
rule
whether
it
was
pled
or
not
wouldn't
satisfy
them
and
says
we
didn't
plead
that
rule
that
was
the
only
thing
they
were
willing
to
consider.
and
therefore
they
said
that
will
--
not
only
the
pleading
but
the
evidence
fails
to
exclude
alabama
jurisdiction.
but
of
course
when
you
get
into
the
integrated
operation,
evidence
and
the
pleadings
we
fully
raise
the
federal
question.
in
that
connection
i'd
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
a
case
which
is
not
mentioned
in
our
brief
which
is
the
case
of
rose
staub
against
the
city
of
baxley
in
which
the
georgia
court
ruled
that
the
constitutional
question
was
not
properly
raised
and
would
not
consider
the
constitutional
question.
this
court
granted
certiorari
and
said
well
maybe
if
one
raised
properly
in
georgia
but
it's
a
federal
constitution
in
spite
of
this
court,
the
question
is
sufficiently
raised
and
this
court
did
consider
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
so
--
sir?
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
i
don't
have
it
mr.
justice
clark.
i
will
get
it
if
you
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
rose
staub
against
the
city
of
baxley
--
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
r.
goldthwaite,
jr.
mr.
justice
harlan,
in
further
response
to
your
question
about
us
supplying
for
an
advisory
opinion
i'd
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
fact
that
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
we
cite
these
other
companion
cases
which
are
still
pending
in
alabama
courts
in
which
injunctions
are
outstanding.
in
the
case
which
is
now
in
the
alabama
supreme
court
we
applied
for
an
advisory
opinion
and
gotten
the
advisory
opinion
from
the
labor
board
stating
that
the
labor
board
affirmatively
would
assert
jurisdiction
in
a
set
of
facts
substantially
identical
to
the
present
case.
we
pled
in
that
case
the
labor
board's
decision
attached
it
to
our
plea
to
the
jurisdiction.and
the
alabama
court
totally
ignored
the
labor
board's
advisory
opinion.
they
said,
"well,
the
labor
board
is
not
going
to
advise
us
in
effect".
and
just
--
in
spite
of
the
advisory
opinion
they
issued
the
injunction
and
that
injunction
is
still
in
effect
and
has
been
in
effect
over
two
years.
