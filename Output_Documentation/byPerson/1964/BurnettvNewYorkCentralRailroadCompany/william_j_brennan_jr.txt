so
far
as
the
venue
is
concerned
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
did
plaintiff
fail
to
satisfy
that
clause?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
accident
occurred
in
indiana.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
your
--
basically
your
position
that
this
has
begun,
these
facts
--
equitably,
you
in
fact
brought
your
action
within
the
federal
statute
of
limitation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
a
sub
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
statute
of
course
let
us
--
was
it
possible
on
these
facts
to
bring
an
action
of
that
section
of
constitutional
in
anywhere
in
any
course
of
ohio?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
but
on
these
facts
my
question
was
whether
it
was
possible
to
bring
this
fela
action
in
any
ohio
state
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather,
you
don't
think
you
have
to
rely
on
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
his
position
was
that
in
face
of
that
venue
statute,
there
was
no
ohio
court
which
actually
what
i
thought.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
could
be
that
the
defendant
didn't
raise
the
venue,
could
he
go
on
in
the
court?
