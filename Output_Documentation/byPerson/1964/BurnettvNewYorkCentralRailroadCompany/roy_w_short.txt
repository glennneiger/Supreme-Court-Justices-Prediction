mr.
roy
w.
short
mr.
chief
justice
may
the
court
please.
the
petitioner
in
his
briefs
and
in
his
oral
argument
today
has
referred
to
many
cases
exemplifying
the
equity
powers
of
our
courts.
such
powers
invoked
under
unique,
some
times
peculiar
and
nearly
always
extreme
circumstances.
this
is
as
it
should
be.
certainly
a
fundamental
theory
our
equity
jurisprudence
is
predicated
upon
a
remedy
at
law
being
inadequate
or
a
non-existent.
i
don't
think
any
sensible
person
and
this
is
inline
with
the
cases
cited
by
the
petitioner
whether
he'd
be
a
layman,
a
lawyer
or
a
jurist
would
deny
access
to
our
courts
to
a
plaintiff
who
could
not
bring
his
action
within
the
statutory
time
because
of
internment
as
a
prisoner
war.
similarly,
can
anyone
question
the
justice
in
tolling
a
statute
and
opening
the
courtroom
door
to
one
who
because
of
a
state
of
war
was
prevented
from
filing
in
time?
a
plaintiff
lulled
by
the
defendant
into
inactivity
induced
by
willful
misrepresentations
or
by
means
of
other
manifest
fraud
prevented
from
filing
within
time
should
not,
cannot
and
i
don't
believe
will
be
denied
access
to
our
courts.
i
think
this
is
the
law
and
i
think
it
is
good
law.
it
has
however
been
delicately
conceded
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case
that
his
present
predicament
is
a
result
of
initiating
suit
in
the
wrong
court,
not
being
prevented
from
filing
his
suit.
he
now
seeks
to
engraft
the
ohio
saving
statute
as
an
exception
to
the
federal
act
which
in
and
of
itself
has
no
exceptions.
let
us
first
consider
a
point
in
time
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
federal
employer's
liability
act,
mr.
otto
v.
burnett,
the
petitioner
for
example,
might
have
been
able
to
file
his
suit
in
his
state
of
kentucky
and
be
guided
by
kentucky
statute
of
limitations.
he
might
as
the
cause
of
action
arose
in
indiana,
have
filed
in
the
state
of
indiana
and
be
governed
by
the
their
statute
of
limitations
or
have
the
cause
of
action
arose
in
ohio,
filed
and
be
governed
by
ohio
statute
of
limitations
which
incidentally
is
two
years
in
referenced
to
personal
injuries.
then
congress
enacted
—-
mr.
roy
w.
short
pardon
me
justice
brennan?
mr.
roy
w.
short
i'm
coming
to
that
justice
brennan,
that
is
correct.
mr.
roy
w.
short
then
you're
being
of
course
only
jurisdictional
if
the
defendant
raises
it,
he
could
go
on
of
course
venue
can
be
waived
upon.
mr.
roy
w.
short
pardon
me
justice?
mr.
roy
w.
short
the
case
could
be
filed
and
i'll
discuss
that
in
quite
—
mr.
roy
w.
short
well,
in
fact
it
would
have
to
be
the
wrong
court
if
we
assert
that
position
and
obtain
an
motion
to
quash
our
summons.
mr.
roy
w.
short
then
that
court,
yes
your
honor,
then
that
court
could
have
gone
through
to
a
decision
without
an
objection
being
raised
by
the
defendant.
after
congress
enacted
the
federal
employer's
liability
act,
it
seems
to
me
there
were
certain
benefits,
certain
protections
and
certain
advantages
afforded
to
a
potential
plaintiff
under
this
act.
in
ohio
for
example
as
in
many
other
states
substantial
defenses
of
perhaps
contributory
negligence,
assumption
of
the
risk
were
not
available
to
a
defendant
under
this
act.
the
two-year
statute
of
limitations
for
example
existing
in
the
state
of
ohio
became
three
years
under
the
federal
act
and
subsequent
to
its
most
recent
amendment.
members
of
the
court,
this
is
a
federal
law
the
federal
employer's
liability
act,
it's
a
statute,
a
congressional
pronouncement,
if
you
will,
creating
a
new
right
and
setting
forth
in
precise
terms,
the
time
would
then
which
such
right
maybe
exercised.
i
wish
now
to
direct
this
honorable
court's
attention
to
just
one
case
cited
in
my
brief
bell
versus
wabash
railway
company
and
the
case
is
noted
on
page
5
and
make
a
very
brief
quote
from
that
case.
the
court
said
at
page
571,
“an
act
of
congress
which
at
the
same
time
and
in
itself
authorizes
or
creates
a
new
liability
and
prescribes
the
limitations
thereof
and
of
its
enforcement,
makes
those
limitation's
conditions
as
to
the
liability
itself.
such
an
act
is
not
a
statute
of
limitations
and
a
compliance
with
the
conditions
which
it
prescribes
is
indispensable
to
the
enforcement
of
the
liability
it
authorizes
or
creates
because
such
limitations
are
conditions
of
the
liability
itself
and
not
limitations
of
the
remedy
only."
i
submit
that
this
case
and
the
other
cited
by
myself
in
my
briefs
by
the
respondent
herein
clearly
establish
that
the
federal
three-year
limitation
in
the
federal
act
is
substantive.
in
my
opinion
however
i'll
go
one
step
further.
i
think
that
many
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
petitioner
would
have
been
decided
in
the
same
manner
whether
the
courts
had
found
a
limitation
procedural
or
substantive.
i
submit
further
that
the
decisions
cited
by
the
petitioner
were
made
under
circumstances,
extreme,
circumstances
which
to
do
otherwise
would
offend
the
cognitions
of
many
right
thinking
persons.
may
the
court
please
this
plaintiff
otto
v.
burnett
through
its
counsel
prepared
a
petition,
alleging
facts,
bringing
him
within
the
protection
and
benefits
of
the
federal
employer's
liability
act,
not
the
least
of
which
is
the
three-year
period
within
which
to
assert
this
right.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
state
statute
allowing
three
years
for
actions
for
personal
injuries.
now
having
possessed
himself
of
the
protection
and
benefits
of
this
act,
it
seems
to
me
that
he
should
comply
with
its
integral
and
its
substantive
provisions.
mr.
burnett
for
reasons
known
only
to
himself,
permitted
approximately
1090
days
to
pass
from
the
time
his
cause
of
action
arose
before
asserting
his
alleged
claim,
then
filed
his
suit
in
the
wrong
court.
his
was
the
choice
of
the
forum
of
action.
his
was
the
choice
of
the
court
to
hear
the
action.
he
was
not
a
prisoner
of
war.
there
was
no
situation
occasioned
by
state
of
war
preventing
from
filing
his
suit
or
making
him
file
in
the
wrong
court.
the
defendant
made
no
misrepresentations,
no
one
perpetrated
a
fraud
inducing
him
to
file
in
the
wrong
court.
there
is
no
single
case
cited
by
the
petitioner,
in
point
factually
or
legally
with
his
present
position,
mr.
roy
w.
short
no
i
don't,
your
honor.
i
intend
to
deal
with
that
at
the
close
of
my
argument
here
orally.
mr.
roy
w.
short
i
certainly
believe
it
does
your
honor
and
i
intend
to
point
that
out
orally.
if
we
are
to
follow
the
plaintiff's
theory,
what
then
will
be
the
meaning,
the
future
meaning
of
the
three-year
federal
limitation?
following
this
theory
can
we
say
to
future
claimants
under
this
act;
first,
make
up
the
petition,
alleging
injuries
and
facts
bringing
you
within
the
federal
employer's
liability
act,
then
file
it
in
the
court,
almost
any
court,
but
file
it.
then
let
that
court
or
possibly
opposing
counsel
to
tell
you
what
court
you
should
be
in,
go
there,
file
your
suit
and
then
lay
back
and
bask
in
the
arms
of
a
state
savings
clause.
mr.
roy
w.
short
in
general,
justice
goldberg,
there
is
venue
in
personal
injury
actions
---
mr.
roy
w.
short
simply
because
the
action
here
was
filed
against
a
railroad
company
and
there
is
a
separate
section
in
ohio's
revised
code
pertaining
to
venue
against
railway
companies.
therefore
if
a
person
were
suing
another
personal
for
an
automobile
accident,
this
section
would
not
be
involved.
it's
only
when
a
person
seeks
venue
against
a
railway
company
that
this
particular
section
of
the
code
is
involved
and
it
provides
essentially
that
the
plaintiff
must
either
reside
in
the
county
or
a
cause
or
a
part
of
that
cause
of
action
must
have
arisen
in
the
county
in
which
the
railroad
has
a
line
or
is
doing
business.
mr.
roy
w.
short
yes,
it
is,
justice
goldberg.
in
other
sections
and
in
general
terms,
personal
injury
actions
of
course
being
transitory
in
nature
are
governed
in
the
sense
that
the
plaintiff
neighboring
his
action
in
the
county
in
which
the
cause
of
action
arose
or
in
which
he
can
obtain
service
upon
the
defendant
and
if
it's
the
case
of
joint
liability,
he
may
bring
his
action
properly
in
one
county
and
service
be
obtained
over
to
another
county
bringing
that
join
defendant
in,
although
that
joint
defendant
could
not
have
been
sued
by
himself.
in
discussing
various
ramifications
of
this
case
in
recent
months
many
of
my
colleagues
have
urged
that
i'm
representing
a
so
called
target
defendant.
they
have
urged
that
if
my
client
was
a
poor
little
white
haired
lady,
we
wouldn't
have
seen
the
united
states
district
court
much
less
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
i
don't
know
about
that,
i
do
know
that
beyond
question
–-
mr.
roy
w.
short
pardon
me
mr.
justice?
mr.
roy
w.
short
i
don't
know
about
their
feelings
and
i'm
not
willing
to
subscribe
to
the
expressions
that
have
been
urged
on
me.
i
know
beyond
question
that
the
financial
responsibility
of
the
defendant,
well
respondent
in
this
case
new
york
central
railway
while
it
is
of
considerable
significance
to
the
plaintiff,
it's
certainly
there
is
no
consideration
here
or
in
any
other
court,
appellate
or
otherwise.
mr.
roy
w.
short
no
i
don't,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
w.
short
on
the
other
hand,
i
felt
this
way,
there
is
no
place
to
go
after
this
court
and
i
feel
obliged
to
bring
before
this
court
every
thought
i
have
relative
to
this
case.
mr.
roy
w.
short
well
your
honor,
if
we
may
deviate
from
the
record
for
a
moment
i
appreciate
that
and
i
respect
that
fact
and
we
as
attorneys
carry
insurance
for
such
situations
and
i
don't
need
to
go
any
further
there.
i
don't
feel
it
is
of
significance
and
perhaps
i
was
presumptive
in
bringing
it
up
in
the
first
place.
mr.
roy
w.
short
in
conclusion
i
would
like
to
mention
to
the
court
that
and
most
respectfully
urge
the
court
to
bear
in
mind,
this
is
a
federal
law
with
which
we
are
dealing.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
basic
purpose
of
federal
legislation
is
to
establish
a
rule
of
law
uniform
to
all
states,
uniform
to
all
citizens
of
those
states.
if
we
permit
this
situation
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
we
could
possibly
and
conceivably
resolve
in
facing
a
georgia
litigant
under
fela,
having
the
three
years
within
the
commence
an
action
or
attempt
to
commence
it
and
another
six
months
if
he
fails
otherwise
on
the
merits
to
bring
his
action
properly
in
the
right
court.
mr.
roy
w.
short
it
does
justice
goldberg,
precisely
it
does
and
i
again
would
like
to
urge
at
this
point
upon
the
court,
i'm
not
expressing
in
doing
an
attempt
to
express
my
feeling
about
the
merits
of
the
venue
section
in
reference
to
service
upon
railroads,
but
i'm
simply
saying
that
under
the
present
existing
law,
this
situation
should
not
be
permitted
to
exist.
we
can
have
an
indiana
litigant
under
fela,
commencing
action
within
three
years
and
have
five
more
years
if
he
fails
otherwise
then
on
the
merits
within
which
to
properly
file
his
action
or
properly
re-file
his
action.
in
maryland,
i
could
locate
no
savings
clause,
therefore
a
maryland
litigant
would
have
the
three-year
period
extended
to
him
under
the
federal
act.
in
michigan,
he
might
have
three
years
plus
90
days
and
so
forth.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
if
that
were
the
intention
of
congress,
it
could
have
provided
such
in
the
act,
when
it
was
enacted.
i
most
respectfully
urge
in
closing
that
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
follow
the
existing
law
and
it
properly
distinguish
those
cases
cited
by
this
plaintiff,
involving
war,
fraud,
estoppel
and
so
forth
from
the
cases
such
as
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
which
i
believe
to
be
precise
in
point.
the
case
cited
by
plaintiff
herb
versus
pitcairn
is
a
removable
case,
a
removable
case,
simply
because
by
the
law
of
illinois,
a
plaintiff
is
permitted
to
file
a
motion
in
a
trial
court
and
if
that
motion
is
granted,
the
same
summons,
the
same
process
and
the
same
case
is
transferred
over
to
a
federal
district
court,
that
is
not
the
law
of
the
state
of
ohio.
a
plaintiff
cannot
remove
a
case
from
a
state
court
in
ohio
to
a
federal
district
court
as
such.
his
only
recourse
is
to
dismiss
his
case
in
state
court
and
re-file
in
the
us
district
court.
on
the
other
hand,
a
defendant
in
the
state
of
ohio
may
remove
his
case
from
state
court
to
federal
court
without
the
issuance
of
new
summons
and
i
submit
that
the
herb
versus
pitcairn
has
no
application
to
this
case
either
and
i
again
most
respectfully
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
ruling
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
thank
you.
mr.
roy
w.
short
yes,
your
honor
the
subject
matter
was
obtained
by
the
court
that
is
it
had
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter.
mr.
roy
w.
short
yes,
your
honor
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
i'm
sure
this
court
well
knows,
if
the
case
had
been
properly
filed
in
the
state
court
to
begin
with
and
if
the
court
had
the
venue,
then
of
course
the
case
could
not
have
been
removed
under
any
circumstances
by
the
defendant.
mr.
roy
w.
short
i
think
justice
goldberg,
however,
in
taking
that
statement
and
i
would
certainly
agree
with
you
that
take
in
its
context
as
you
read
it,
it
would
be
applicable,
but
i
think
an
entire
reading
if
the
case
changes
that.
mr.
roy
w.
short
yes,
your
honor.
