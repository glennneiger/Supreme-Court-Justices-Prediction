mr.
douglas
g.
cole
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
case
of
otto
burnett
v.
new
york
central
railroad.
the
petitioner
was
a
resident
of
the
state
of
kentucky
who
was
employed
by
the
dependent
railroad
and
while
working
in
the
state
of
indiana
on
march
17,
1960,
he
was
injured.
thereafter
on
march
13,
1963
four
days
before
the
three-year
statute
limitations
under
the
federal
employers’
liability
act,
a
suit
was
brought
on
his
behalf
under
the
federal
employers’
liability
act
in
hamilton
county,
ohio,
court
of
common
pleas
and
service
was
issued
and
returned
upon
the
defendant
and
thereafter
the
defendant
came
in
and
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
basis
of
improper
venue
of
the
case.
this
motion
was
granted
by
reason
of
ohio
statute
2307.37,
which
is
a
venue
statute.
thereafter,
within
eight
days
of
the
time
of
the
dismissal
of
the
case
in
the
state
court,
the
suit
was
re-filed
in
the
u.s
district
court
of
the
southern
district
of
ohio
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
relying
upon
the
ohio
saving
statue
which
is
section
2305.19,
of
the
ohio
revised
code,
and
the
respondent
came
in
and
filed
the
motion
to
dismiss,
alleging
that
the
ohio
saving
statute
did
not
apply
in
a
federal
employers’
liability
act
case
and
the
district
court
sustained
the
motion
and
it
was
affirmed
upon
–
from
appeal
to
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
this
squarely
presents
a
very
simple
question
to
this
court
and
that
is,
does
the
three-year
limitation
period
contained
in
a
federal
employers’
liability
act
which
is
section
56
of
the
act,
may
it
be
extended
by
the
ohio
saving
statute
when
a
case
has
been
commenced
within
the
three-year
period,
but
by
reason
of
a
problem
because
of
venue,
the
original
action
has
had
to
be
transferred
to
another
court
which
had
the
jurisdiction
and
the
venue
to
hear
the
case
to
it’s
completion
after
this
three-year
period
of
--
mr.
douglas
g.
cole
that's
correct
sir,
it
really
does
not
matter.
it
just
happened
been
in
a
federal
court
and
that
is
because
the
state
of
–
mr.
douglas
g.
cole
well
as
you
say
in
ohio,
it
could
not
have
happened
in
a
state
court
because
of
venue
section
of
the
statute,
you
cannot
bring
an
action
anywhere
in
ohio
by
nonresident
where
the
cause
arose
outside
of
the
state
ohio.
it
could,
perhaps
has
happened
in
some
other
states,
not
in
ohio.
an
examination
of
the
background
of
section
56
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
itself
indicates
that
there
was
no
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
when
they
first
enacted
that
section,
first,
it
was
two
-ear
section
and
later
amended
to
be
a
three
year
section,
there
was
no
intention
on
their
part
to
make
this
a
limitation
period
which
was
cutoff
at
the
end
of
that
period
of
time
and
not
be
extended
by
various
rules
of
law
such
as
estoppel,
fraud,
fraudulent
concealment
and
the
whole
idea
was
to
grant
minimum
protection
to
the
employees
of
the
railroad
and
not
to
create
some
maximum
series
of
rights.
in
other
words,
they
were
not
attempting
to
say
that
you
had
to
bring
an
action
within
three
years
and
thereafter
you
cannot
bring
any
action.
congress
rather
intended
that
they
were
trying
to
set
up
a
uniform
system,
uniform
minimum
length
of
time
throughout
the
united
states
so
that
various
state
legislatures
cannot
say
in
one
state,
you
had
minimum
of
two
years
or
minimum
of
year-and-a-half
and
then
another
state
say
three
years.
so,
they
were
trying
to
say
that
this
minimum
period
and
there
was
no
attempt
on
a
part
of
congress
at
anytime
to
say
that
the
ordinary
rules
which
applied
to
statue
of
limitations
should
not
apply
to
this
one.
the
only
construction
that
has
caused
this
idea
of
a
substantive
procedural
dichotomy
to
arise
has
been
by
judicial
construction
and
some
of
the
lower
of
courts
of
an
earlier
age,
but
principally
before
1939
and
the
amendment
to
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
where
the
whole
trend
went
the
other
way
in
order
to
protect
the
employees,
considerably
more
than
they
have
ever
been
protected
prior
to
1939.
and
certainly
these
old
cases
which
have
been
cited
repeatedly
to
the
proposition
that
this
was
a
substantive
statue
which
set
up
a
period
of
three
years
and
that
this
was
a
limitation
upon
the
right,
rather
than
upon
a
remedy,
does
not
bear
itself
out
in
any
rational
or
logical
construction
of
the
--
either
the
purpose
of
the
act
or
the
language
itself.
now
we
have
cited
in
number
of
the
cases
which
have
been
decided
in
united
states
by
various
federal
courts
since
1947
and
the
defense
and
as
matter
of
fact
the
sixth
circuit
pick
these
up
saying
that
these
all
contain
problems
of
fraud
or
fraudulent
concealment,
estoppel
by
some
activity
of
the
railroad
as
opposed
to
situation
that
we
have
here
where
there
it
no
fraud
involved,
nobody
said
that
the
railroad
mislead
the
petitioner
in
this
case
as
to
how
long
he
had.
what
we
were
trying
to
show
by
citing
these
cases
is
that
there
has
been
a
revolution
in
the
united
states,
since
mid
1940s
and
the
thinking
on
how
this
federal
employers'
liability
act,
section
56,
the
limitation
period
could
be
handled,
the
package
you
can't
open
it
up.
if
it
can
be
open
for
one
reason
that
certainly
it
can
be
opened
for
the
same
reasons
that
other
statue
limitations
are
generally
opened
up,
whether
it
be
fraud
concealment
or
just
the
circumstances
that
arise
which
call
into
play
state
saving
statues.
now,
we
say
that
it
just
as
unjust
to
a
petitioner
to
make
him
guess
correctly
upon
the
elusive
questions
of
venue
in
a
case
and
make
him
stick
to
that
even
though
he
makes
a
mistake,
this
is
just
as
unjust
as
his
fraud
or
fraudulent
concealment.
he
has
never
had
the
opportunity
to
get
his
case
to
a
court
for
determination
on
the
merits
and
yet
it
is
recognized
by
this
court
in
decisions
of
this
court
that
this
can
be
just
as
unjust,
the
problem
of
wading
through
elusive
questions
of
venue,
this
can
be
just
as
unfair
as
any
other
form
of
problem
such
as
fraud
which
calls
for
equitable
inter
position
by
a
court.
in
the
case
of
which
i
have
cited
in
the
brief
of
goldlawr
versus
heiman,
369
u.s.
463,
a
point
is
made
that
this
problem
of
employing
injustice
where
some
elusive
fact
that
were
the
kind
upon
which
venue
provisions
often
turn
is
required
in
order
to
that
an
expeditious
and
orderly
adjudication
of
cases
and
controversies
on
their
merits
can
be
had.
as
the
court
there
point
it
out,
the
main
problem
is
a
question
of
whether
there
has
been
notice
to
the
defendant
within
at
three-year
period
and
there
is
no
question
that
in
this
particular
case
there
was
notice
to
the
defendant.
they
were
actually
served
with
the
summons
within
the
three-year
period
of
time
and
it
was
only
after
they
came
in
and
defended
the
case
in
the
common
pleas
court
of
hamilton
county,
ohio,
that
it
was
subsequently
removed
to
the
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
ohio.
so
there
is
no
question
that
the
petitioner
had
done
all
that
he
could.
mr.
douglas
g.
cole
yes,
there
is
a
the
venue
statute
of
the
state
of
ohio,
it
is
a
very
peculiar
one,
which
reads
that
an
action
against
the
owner
or
lessee
of
line
mail
of
stages,
coaches,
railway
companies,
inner
urban
railway
companies,
sub-urban
railway
companies
or
street
railway
company,
maybe
brought
in
any
county
through
which
the
line
extends.
however,
all
actions
against
such
owner,
lessee
or
company
for
injuries
to
personal
property
or
for
wrongful
death
must
be
brought
in
the
county
in
which
the
cause
of
action
are
some
part
thereof
arose
or
in
the
county
in
which
the
claimant
for
injury
to
the
personal
property
was
caused
resides
at
the
time
when
the
cause
of
action
arose,
if
the
line
or
owner
is
located
in
such
a
county.
it
goes
on
–
another
–
mr.
douglas
g.
cole
because
the
plaintiff
was
a
resident
of
kentucky.
mr.
douglas
g.
cole
the
accident
occurred
in
indiana
and
while
ohio
allows
every
transitory
cause
of
action,
they
allow
every
transitory
cause
of
action
except
this
particular
transitory
cause
of
action
which
is
barred
and
i
had
considered
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
that
section
which
i
think
is
constitutional,
but
i
instead
went
the
route
of
refilling
under
the
state
saving
statute
in
an
us
district
court
because
i
felt
that
it
from
a
rational
standpoint,
it
followed
necessarily
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
both
herb
versus
pitcairn
in
324
and
325
u.s.
and
the
glus
versus
brooklyn
eastern
terminal
in
359
u.s.,
because
both
of
those
cases
have
discussed
in
a
passing
way
exactly
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
mr.
douglas
g.
cole
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
g.
cole
yes,
the
–
in
the
case
of
herb
versus
pitcairn
in
the
original
case
in
324
u.s.,
this
was
a
case
that
was
brought
in
a
city
court
of
illinois
when
that
court
did
not
have
proper
venue
to
try
the
whole
case,
but
they
had
a
venue
statute
in
illinois
allow
them
to
transfer
the
case
to
another
court
in
illinois
that
had
jurisdiction
and
venue
to
handle
the
whole
case
without
the
new
issuance
of
process
and
there
exactly
the
same
thing
happened
as
happened
here.
the
original
suit
was
brought
within
a
three-year
period,
but
by
the
time
a
motion
to
dismiss
was
brought
in
the
city
court
in
illinois,
the
three-year
statute
had
run
and
when
the
case
was
transferred
over
to
the
proper
court
in
illinois
which
could
try
the
case,
the
defendant
then
came
in
and
said
it
was
too
late,
it
couldn't
even
transfer
it
even
though
no
new
service
process
was
required.
now
this
court
in
that
case,
in
its
twins
decisions
in
324
and
325
u.s.
said
that
the
case
had
been
commenced
within
the
meaning
of
the
word
as
it
is
used
in
section
56,
the
federal
employees
liability
act,
when
it
was
first
brought
in
the
city
court
and
the
mere
fact
that
it
had
to
be
transferred
later
to
a
court
which
could
properly
hear
the
case,
did
not
militate
against
the
theory
that
the
word
commenced
in
the
section
of
the
limitation
statute
meant
started,
notice
being
given
to
the
defendant
and
that's
exactly
what
we
are
saying
here.
the
only
distinction
between
that
case
and
this
case
is
the
fact
that
under
the
state
of
ohio
saving
statute
new
service
of
process
has
to
be
issued
when
the
case
is
transferred
under
that
saving
statute.
but
otherwise
--
mr.
douglas
g.
cole
well
if
i
may
go
outside
the
record
for
a
moment
i
can
answer
you.
for
eight
years
i
represented
the
new
york
central
in
cincinnati.
during
that
time
i
represented
new
york
central,
we
had
convinced
the
new
york
central
that
it
was
to
their
advantage
not
to
enact
--
i
mean
not
to
interpose
this
venue
section
because
they
would
be
better
off
if
they
tried
the
case
in
the
state
court
and
that
was
--
then
i
left
that
firm
and
went
on
separately
represented
the
petitioner
in
this
case
and
i
thought
they
were
working
on
the
same
theory.
they
were
better
off,
if
they
try
the
case
in
the
state
court
better
than
in
an
federal
court
and
i
learned
to
my
amazement
that
--
i
was
no
longer--
mr.
douglas
g.
cole
well
as
i
further
investigated
the
case
after
they
filed
the
motion
to
dismiss,
i
am
fairly
well
convinced
now
that
under
the
present
reading
of
the
construction
of
the
statute
it
is
impossible
to
have
brought
it
in
the
state
court,
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
g.
cole
that's
correct.
i
believe
that
it
is
--
some
interesting
thing,
there
were
two
associates
in
this
law
firm
that
i
worked
in
representing
new
york
central,
both
us
are
now
out
of
that
firm.
the
one
lawyer
is
in
cleveland
and
--
his
case
is
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
that
section,
my
case
went
be
other
way
and
as
taken.
mr.
douglas
g.
cole
i
am
not
arguing
the
constitutionality
of
that
ohio
venue
section,
although
i
think
it
is
unconstitutional
but
it's
not
raised
in
this
case.
the
point
–-
mr.
douglas
g.
cole
the
point
that
i
was
bringing
out
in
this
herb
versus
pitcairn
is
–
the
case
is
that
the
court
there
realized
the
problem
that
petitioners
can
get
into
struggling
with
venue
statute
and
they
--
and
the
court
announced
in
that
case
the
necessity
of
giving
an
employ
of
the
railroad
the
opportunity
to
try
his
case
on
a
merits
and
not
allow
him
to
get
bogged
down
in
procedural
niceties
which
would
prevent
this
because
he
guessed
wrong
when
he
first
filed
the
suit,
when
he
done
everything
he
could
to
put
him
on
notice
that
he
was
bringing
an
action.
there
was
no
question
of
his
defrauding
that
railroad
by
waiting
years
and
years
--
and
where
the
witnesses
will
get
lost
anything
like
that
because
they
suit
had
originally
being
brought
within
the
period
of
time
setup
by
this
statute
and
therefore
the
ruling
--
the
rules
in
both
of
these
cases
are
important
more
than
anything
else
because
they
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
limitation
section
which
prohibits
the
operation
of
a
section
like
the
ohio
saving
statute.
as
was
said
in
--
by
mr.
jackson
--
by
mr.
justice
jackson
in
the
second
herb
versus
pitcairn
in
325
at
page
79,
the
case,
--
an
action
is
'commenced'
for
these
purposes
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
when
instituted
by
service
of
process
issued
out
of
a
state
court,
even
if
one
which
itself
is
unable
to
proceed
to
judgment,
if
the
state
law
or
practice
directs
or
permits
the
transfer
through
change
of
venue
or
otherwise
to
a
court
which
does
have
jurisdiction
to
hear,
try,
and
otherwise
determine
that
cause.
in
other
words,
he
made
the
point
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
section
of
the
federal
statute
which
prohibits
the
operation
of
a
state
statute
in
conjunction
with
it
which
is
exactly
what
we
are
seeking
to
have
accomplished
here
today.
mr.
douglas
g.
cole
well
the
reason
that
i
have
stressed
in
earlier
in
my
argument
here
mr.
justice
harlan
that
what
converse
attempted
to
do
with
this
section
56
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
was
to
grant
certain
minimum
protection
to
employees
of
railroads.
they
weren't
attempting
to
set-up
maximum
rights
and
therefore
the
maximum
period
of
time
will
vary
from
case
to
case
but
they
certainly
have
minimum
lengths
of
time
which
is
three
years
plus
the
interposition
of
any
equitable
remedies
that
arise
either
by
federal
or
state
law
and
that
would
be
the
maximum
period,
but
i
think
that
you
can
use
that
argument
as
an
argument
against
the
position
that
i
make
simply
because
there
is
some
variance
in
the
maximum
length
of
time.
what
we
are
seeking
is
a
minimum
protection
of
these
people
which
is
that
equitable
rule
should
apply
as
well
as
mere
wording
of
the
statute
itself.
mr.
douglas
g.
cole
well
as
i
say
that
that
in
a
case
like
that
--
there
would
be
a
maximum
period
of
time
of
the
three
years
but
unfortunately
they
would
not
get
benefit
of
it.
mr.
douglas
g.
cole
well,
yes
except
that
--
i
think
that
a
lot
of
this
--
the
lot
of
the
problem
that
i
seek
is
pointing
up
is
the
fact
that
attorney
representing
petitioners
base
their
original
thinking
on
in
terms
of
the
statute
they
feel
like
can
work
with.
in
other
words,
in
ohio
where
you
have
both
the
federal
employers
liability
act
section
56
and
a
state
saving
statute
you
can
tend
to
consider
those
together
and
you
would
work
accordingly
--
i
mean
you
might
not
bring
a
case
quite
as
soon
figuring
that
you
have
the
opportunity
to
use
a
state
saving
statute
if
some
mistake
was
made
on
venue
or
jurisdiction
where
you
might
otherwise
in
a
state
where
there
was
no
saving
statute,
bring
your
action
much
earlier.
a
lot
of
that
is
a
matter
of
choice
depending
upon
the
numbers
of
statutes
you
have
to
work
with.
we
just
want
to
point
out
the
applicability
of
both
the
glus
and
the
herb
versus
pitcairn
cases
on
the
whole
logic
that
this
case
was
commenced
within
the
proper
length
of
time
and
this
is
the
logic
rather
of
the
herb
versus
pitcairn
that
the
commencement
of
the
enactment
in
the
first
place
does
not
require
an
interposition
of
any
equitable
remedy
such
as
you
had
in
some
of
these
earlier
cases
of
the
questions
of
estoppel
or
fraudulent
concealment.
in
herb
v.
pitcairn
cases
they
said
frankly
as
the
court
said
at
that
time,
that
the
case
was
commenced
properly
within
the
three-year
period
and
merely
because
it
had
to
be
transferred
over
to
another
court
was
not
--
did
not
detract
from
the
basic
determination
that
the
case
had
been
commenced
when
it
was
first
filed
in
the
original
court.
now
you
can
really
apply
the
logic
of
those
two
cases
herb
versus
pitcairn,
to
this
case
because
the
case
here
was
commenced
within
the
proper
length
of
time
and
it
had
to
be
transferred
over
to
another
court,
but
only
after
a
proper
notice
to
the
defendant
and
the
only
deference
is
the
question
of
the
giving
of
the
new
service
of
process
which
at
least
in
the
original
herb
versus
pitcairn
cases
was
not
considered
to
be
too
important
although
it
was
not
necessary
to
decide
it,
but
if
i
can
read
those
decisions,
it
is
fairly
obvious
that
the
court
at
that
time
did
not
feel
that
that
point
dispositive
of
anything
because
the
basic
question
the
that
defendant
had
notice,
the
plaintiff
had
brought
the
suit
within
the
three-year
and
that
those
were
the
operative
question.
now
the
court
in
the
glus
case,
the
359
case
went
about
it
from
a
different
angle.
in
other
words
instead
of
saying
the
case
was
commenced
within
the
proper
period
of
time
instead
they
said
that
even
if
you
didn't
commence
it
within
the
proper
period
of
time
your
equitable
remedy
such
as
estoppel
would
allow
the
limitation
period
of
the
statue
to
be
opened
up,
to
be
tolled,
to
be
extended,
and
if
you
use
that
logic,
you'd
still
come
to
the
same
result
which
is
the
state
saving
statute
is
a
method
that
can
be
used
to
extend
or
toll
the
operation
of
the
federal
saving
statute
i
mean
the
federal
limitations
statute.
mr.
douglas
g.
cole
well
i
think
only
to
the
extend
that
new
service
of
process
was
necessary
as
opposed
to
the
other
case,
but
other
than
that
i
don't
think
that
it's
a
question
of
words.
i
mean,
after
all
this
wasn't
a
case
where
we
waited
several
years
to
bring
the
suit
or
anything
like
that
and
that's
why
i
think
that
it
is
--
well
it
is
the
case
that
saving
statute
was
set
up
to
accomplish
and
this,
the
federal
government
under
the
federal
statutes,
the
federal
courts
have
used
state
saving
statutes.
they
are
empowered
to
do
this
and
this
is
the
rule
uniformly
throughout
the
united
states
and
we
submit
that
the
only
way
this
petitioner
can
get
through
all
of
these
time
consuming
and
justice
defeating
technicalities
as
they
have
been
called
in
the
past
by
a
number
of
judges
and
get
to
a
decision
of
this
case
upon
merits.
it's
for
this
court
to
either
say
that
there
is
no
distinction
between
procedure
and
substance
as
far
as
what
you
call
a
limitation
period
that
they
all
stem
from
the
same
basic
idea
and
that
is
a
giving
of
notice
to
defendant
within
a
length
of
time
or
in
the
alternative
that
you
say
that
this
case
was
commenced
properly
within
the
three-year
period.
in
either
case
this
particular
petitioner
deserves
his
day
in
court.
