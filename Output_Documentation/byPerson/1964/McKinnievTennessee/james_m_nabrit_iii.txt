mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
sit-in
case
here
on
certiorari
from
tennessee's
highest
court.
petitioners
are
8
young
negro
college
men
whose
liberty
is
at
stake
because
they
attempted
to
eat
at
a
white
only
cafeteria
in
nashville
in
october
21,
1962
and
remained
standing
at
the
entrance
vestibule
after
the
doorman
had
barred
their
way
because
of
their
race.
they
were
convicted
of
conspiracy
by
a
jury
which
agreed
on
a
fine
of
less
than
$50
although
empowered
to
find
on
as
much
as
a
$1,000.
the
trial
judge
imposed
the
fine
--
the
$50
fine
and
added
a
90-day
work
house
sentence.
their
claims
that
their
conduct
was
constitutionally
protected
were
rejected
on
appeal
for
the
state's
highest
court.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
is
permissible
under
the
state
law
the
jury
controls
fines
over
$50.
the
court
--
the
judge
controls
the
jail
sentence.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
there
is
a
procedure
for
a
defendant
to
request
that
if
you
done
more
trial
that
was
not
done.
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
the
case
before
its
decisions
in
hamm
v.
rock
hill
and
blow
v.
north
carolina
holding
that
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
abated
all
pending
prosecutions
for
non-forcible
attempt
to
enter
or
remain
in
establishments
covered
by
the
act.
now,
this
case
does
not
merely
involve
the
liberty
of
these
young
men
for
by
its
arguments
here,
tennessee
is
attempting,
we
think
to
nullify
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
by
criminal
prosecutions
brought
under
a
law
which
the
tennessee
supreme
court
itself
admitted
was
originally
enacted
in
1875
to
nullify
the
civil
rights
act
of
1875
dealing
with
the
public
accommodations.
now
we
make
six
somewhat
related
arguments,
and
i'd
like
to
state
them
briefly
now
as
i
probably
will
not
have
the
opportunity
to
argue
them
all.
first,
we
make
an
abatement
argue
based
on
hamm
against
rock
hill.
second,
we
make
a
state
action
racial
discrimination
argument
premised
on
lombard
versus
louisiana
and
robinson
against
florida
among
other
cases.
third,
we
make
an
argument
that
there's
no
evidence
either
of
a
conspiracy
to
obstruct
the
restaurant
or
of
a
conspiracy
to
call
the
riot
two
of
the
things
--
two
of
the
several
things
charged
in
the
indictment
and
we
rely
--
we
rely
on
the
thompson
versus
louisville
doctrine.
fourth,
we
urged
that
there
was
error
in
instructions
to
the
jury
which
invited
the
jury
to
convict
on
various
unconstitutional
grounds.
including
among
others,
an
erroneous
instruction
about
the
statutes
the
defendants
were
accused
of
violating.
trial
judge
told
the
jury
three
times
that
the
defendants
were
charged
with
violating
the
law
which
they
were
not
--
they
were
not
accused
of.
and
also
whether
the
--
that
the
trial—
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes.
the
trial
judge
three
times
during
his
instructions
to
the
jury
told
the
jury
that
these
defendants
were
accused
of
a
conspiracy
to
violate
section
62-710
of
the
tennessee
laws
which
i'll
describe
in
a
moment
but
this
is
a
section
briefly
that
abrogates
the
common
law
(inaudible)
and
this
wasn't
true.
the
state
court
held
that
was
error
but
said
it
didn't
see
how
it
could
affect
the
judgment
of
the
jury.
and
the
other
related
matters,
the
fact
that
the
accusation
read
to
the
jury
as
part
of
the
instructions
asserted
the
petitioners
went
to
the
restaurant
with
one
of
the
things
they're
accused
of
is
going
to
the
restaurant
knowing
that
other
people
like
patrons
might
attack
them.
fifth,
we
make
an
argument
based
on
cole
against
arkansas
that
the
appellant
court
rested
its
affirmance
on
a
theory
of
what
the
crime
was
which
was
completely
contrary
to
the
theory
on
which
the
case
was
tried
and
litigated
and
submitted
to
the
jury.
and
sixth,
there's
an
argument
that
the
jurors
were
not
impartial
with
respect
to
the
segregation
issue
which
was
central
to
the
case.
now
on
the
first
point,
the
hamm
v.
rock
hill
issue
abatement
question.
there
is
apparently
no
dispute
about
the
fact
that
title
ii
of
the
civil
rights
act
covers
the
bmw
cafeteria.
state's
brief
apparently
assumes
this
and
we
think
correctly
so.
this
restaurant
is
a
large
450-seat
cafeteria
located
in
nashville's
downtown
business
district
open
to
the
general
public
and
offering
to
serve
interstate
travelers,
we
think
within
the
meaning
of
section
201
c2
of
the
civil
rights
act.
also
the
fact
of
racial
discrimination
is
undisputed
on
the
evidence
and
indeed
admitted
on
the
face
of
the
grand
jury's
presenter
but
the
state
contends
that
petitioners
are
not
detected
by
the
act
on
the
ground
that
their
conduct
was
not
peaceful
and
asserts
that
their
acts
were
criminal
even
if
they
had
a
right
to
eat
at
the
restaurant.
there
are
several
answers
to
this.
at
first,
the
case
wasn't
tried
on
this
basis
and
the
accusation
wasn't
made
obviously.
the
case
was
--
accusation
proceeded
on
the
theory
that
the
restaurant
had
a
right
to
exclude
these
petitioners
under
a
tennessee
law
has
to
give
them
that
right
and
this
was
a
whole
theory
of
the
case
in
the
trial
court.
i'm
going
to
talk
about
the
accusation
statutes
involved
and
the
judge's
instructions
to
the
jury
and
in
describing
pretending
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
scope
of
--
we
submit
the
scope
of
abatement
under
the
civil
rights
act.
the
scope
of
its
protection
is
the
same
as
the
scope
of
present
protection
for
people
who
commit
acts
there
under
the
--
in
establishments
covered
by
the
act.
now
the
accusation
mentioned
three
statutes
which
are
set
out
in
our
brief
and
the
federal
courts
petitioners'
brief
of
pages
4
and
5.
the
first
of
the
statutes
is
the
conspiracy
law
section
39-1101
subsection
7
prohibits
a
conspiracy
to
commit
any
act
injurious
to
public
health,
public
morals,
trade
of
commerce.
the
indictment
alleged
the
petitioners
inspired
to
injure
the
trade
of
business
with
a
bmw
cafeteria
in
nashville.
now,
the
next
two
statutes—
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
at
the
moment,
your
honor,
i
was
just
attempting
to
describe
the
accusation
and
to
point
out
to
the
statute
to
various
statutes
they
were
accused
of
violating
in
this
indictment
which
was
really
a
one
count
indictment.
there
was
no
--
there
were
no
separate
charges
under
these
--
these
various
statutes,
it
was
just
the
one
overall
charge.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes
sir
that
was—
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
your
honor.
the
grand
jury's
resentment
said
that
the
conspiracy
statute
was
violated
and
also
the—
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
conspiracy
to
injure
the
trade
or
business
of
the
bmw
cafeteria
and
the
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes
sir,
well
i
can
read
it.
it's
at
the
top
of
the
second
page
of
the
record.
and
it
says
that
the
defendants
conspired
to
violate
code
section
39-1101
7
that
is
the
conspiracy
law
and
section
62-711.
now
section
62-711
and
the
preceding
section
62-710
where
sections
1
and
2
of
a
single
statute
passed
by
tennessee
in
march
1874
are
the
first
section
abrogated
common
law
duty
of
innkeepers
to
serve
all
commerce,
so
they
could
exclude
anyone
and
the
second
section
which
prohibits
turbulent
or
right
of
conduct
was
designed
to
enforce
the
first
section.
and
this
is
the
law,
i
mentioned
earlier
which
a
contemporary
tennessee
supreme
court
of
1877
asserted
was
passed
to
avoid
the
effects
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1875.
this
law
was
passed.
these
two
sections
were
enacted
three
weeks
after
the
federal
civil
rights
act
that
the
comparison
of
them
confirms
that
statement
of
the
purpose.
they
cover
the
same
types
of
facilities
indeed
the
federal
act
had
a
$500
penalty
against
discriminating
proprietary
and
the
tennessee
statute
turned
it
around
but
with
$500
civil
penalty
against
a
person
who
attempted
to
remain
in
an
establishment
after
being
screwed.
now
the
accusation
runs
from
pages
2
to
5
of
the
records
were
at
length
embraces
a
great
number
of
different
theories.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
of
different
theories,
your
honor.
it
starts
out
by
describing
what
this
restaurant
is
and
then
it
asserts
that
the
restaurant
had
a
policy
of
serving
white
people
only
and
that
this
policy
was
adapted
under
the
statute
under
section
62
710.
and
this
is
the
way
in
which
that
second
law
is
brought
into
the
accusation
but
it's
not
charged
and
they
violated
expressly.
it's
charged
that
the
restaurant
had
a
right
under
the
statute
to
exclude
negroes
because
of
race.
and
that
the
petitioners
went
to
the
restaurant
conspired
to
conduct
sit
in
affairs
at
white
only
restaurants
knowing
that
they
wouldn't
be
served.
then
after
being
charged
as
further
that
after
being
denied
service,
they
conspired
of
blocking
the
entrance
and
charges
that
they
did
this
knowing
that
their
mere
presence
there
was
likely
to
provoke
patrons
of
the
segregated
cafeteria
to
start
a
fight
or
riot
and
that
they
were
these
petitioners
were
engaged
in
a
movement
to
compel
such
restaurant
integrating
against
their
policies
about
them
under
this
law.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
they
were.
there
was
some
evidence
of
that.
the
manager
testified
that
he
heard
the
doorman
asked
them
to
leave.
the
doorman
never
mentioned
that
in
his
testimony
but
there
were
some
evidence,
my
other
witnesses
that
the
doorman
asked
them
to
move
on.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
your
honor.
these
petitioners
got
to
a
vestibule
about
6
foot
glass
doors
and
--
6
foot
wide
glass
doors
which
let
from
the
sidewalk
into
a
vestibule
about
6
feet
square.
and
they
were
blocked
at
the
inner
doors
by
the
guard,
the
doorman
stationary
to
keep
out
negroes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
he
was
hired
--
he
was
hired
some
month
or
so
before
this
incident.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
by
his
own
account,
he
told
them
you
can't
--
he
said,
“you
can't
come
in
and
we
don't
serve
colored
people
here
by
other
witnesses
account
that
he
was
urging
them
to
move
on.
that
was
the
testimony
of
the
manager.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes
sir.
it
was
a
glass
door
leaning
up
the
sidewalk
into
the
building.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes
sir.
now
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
sir
it
is.
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
reference,
your
honor,
mentioned
on
page
299
was
only
the
first
of
three
times
the
court
told
them
--
told
the
jury
that
the
defendants
were
charged
under
this
statute.
the
other
second
times
under
the
bottom
of
302
and
the
third
time
is
over
on
page
305.
now
i
think
it's
important
to
know
about
this
accusation
is
the
defendants
were
not
charged
with
disorderly
conduct
or
breach
of
the
peace.
disorderly
conduct
or
breach
of
the
peace
under
tennessee
law
section
39-1213
carries
only
a
30
day
sentence
whereas
the
defendants
were
charged
with
conspiracy
carrying
the
possible
year
in
jail
and
a
thousand
dollar
fine.
and
they
were
not
charged
with
violating
62-711
directly
that
only
carried
a
fine.
they
were
charged
with
a
conspiracy
to
violate.
now
we
submit
that
the
--
on
the
abatement
argument
that
the
conviction
should
be
reversed
just
on
the
face
of
the
accusation
because
certainly
under
the
ham
case
any
such
accusation
as
this,
if
it
were
filed
on
the
court
today
would
be
obviously
fatally
defective
under
the
civil
rights
and
it's
totally
a
consistent
with
the
civil
rights
act
in
1964,
and
there
was
no
pretense
here
as
there
would
--
as
there
has
been
in
some
of
the
sit-in
cases
which
has
come
before
this
court
that
something
other
than
racial
discrimination
was
involved
here.
it's
on
the
face
of
the
accusation.
and
the
same
observation,
i
think
applies
to
the
judge's
instructions
to
the
jury.
he
read
the
whole
resentment
with
implicit
approval
to
the
grand
jury.
he
told
they
made
this
mistake
three
times
about
the
statute
and
then
he
explained
the
conspiracy.
he
explained
what
a
conspiracy
to
commit
acts
injurious
to
a
business
was
in
these
terms
at
page
300.
he
said
that
injurious,
page
300
of
the
record.
he
said
that
injurious
in
this
context
led
an
invasion
or
violation
of
a
legally
protected
interest
or
property
right.
so
this
invited
the
jury
to
convey
that
merely
if
it
believed
that
the
complainants
remain
in
the
restaurant
against
his
wishes.
and
now
we
--
and
again,
an
instruction
that
--
that's
contrary
to
the
theory
of
the
civil
rights
act
or
the
hampton.
i
think,
the
second
overall
answer
to
the
state's
claim—
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
we
certainly
agree
i
think
with
the
statement
in
the
hamm
decision
that
he
cannot
violently
remain
there
or
attempt
to
enter
but
he
can
find
its
way
in.
and
i
was
just
about
to
come
to
the
facts
of
this
case
and
to
argue
that
the
--
there
is
no
evidence
here
which
supports
this
--
what
we
think
was
the
very
unfair
characterization
of
these
petitioner's
conduct
is
then
un-peaceful.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
we
don't
have
such
a
case
but
we
don't
-
we
certainly
wouldn't
argue
that
if
we
did.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
from
their
property,
yes.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
restaurant
is
open
and
they
probably
still
request
against
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
think
that
if
they
do,
that
their
conduct
is
protected
by
the
--
by
section
203c
of
the
act.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
think
the
--
obviously,
there
are
potential,
factual
differences,
but
i
urge
that
--
i
mean
in
some
cases
there
might
be
differences
but
i
think
in
this
case
there
was
no
difference.
the
entrance
way
in
this
case
was
not
blocked.
if
you
go
through
the
record,
you'll
see
there
was
testimony
that
18
different
people
actually
went
through
this
vestibule
while
petitioners
were
standing
there.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
think
there's
a
difference
between
standing
in
a
vestibule
attempting
to
enter
which
is
what
these
petitioners
were
doing
now
deliberate
effort
to
block
the
place.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
as
i
said,
18
people
did
manage
to
go
through
while
these
petitioners
were
standing.
but
in
that
situation,
i
would
--
i
would
say
that
the
policy
of
the
civil
rights
act
prevails
over
any
incidental
injury
to
the
business
which
is
attended
upon
the
manager's
discriminatory
action
in
violation
of
the
act.
it
immediately
flows
from
it
and
coincidentally,
the
manager
discrimination.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
suppose
i'll
accept
i
mean
what
i
said
the
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no,
that
was
the
point
i
tried
to
make
that
if
someone
went
there
for
the
purpose
of
obstructing
a
restaurant
rather
on
purpose
of
requesting
service,
well
what
these
young
men
were
doing,
they
weren't
blocking
the
place
anymore
than
someone
sitting
at
the
lunch
counter
blocked
the
lunch
counter
seat.
he
was
sitting
there
at
the
place
where
he
was
denied
service
asking
for
it.
that's
different
from
courting
off
the
place
and
affirmatively
trying
to
stop
people
from
entering.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
they
were
there
a
total
of
25
or
30
minutes
apparently
but
most
of
the
consensus
seems
to
be
–
one
wouldn't
be
sitting
there
ever
long
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
take
it
the
state
argues,
i'm
not
sure
what
their
argument
is.
i
take
it
that
they
argue
that
the
incidental
blocking
of
the
door
is
enough
to
justify
the
conviction.
and
our
point
was
that
the
--
first
the
jury
never
considered
this
case
in
the
context
of
these
petitioner's
rights
to
be
there,
and
totally
convicted
on
the
theory
that
they
had
no
right
to
be
there
but
even
looking
at
it,
in
this
different
way.
the
way
the
jury
never
looked
at
the
case.
there's
no
evidence.
the
doorman,
64-years-old,
weighing
140
pounds,
held
the
door
against
8
men,
periodically
opened
it
to
allow
the
white
patrons
who
brushed
passed
them
to
enter
and
closed
it
again.
the
doorman
testified
their
colloquy
about
the
defendants.
he
says
they
were
wanted
in
but
not
wanting
to
fight
to
get
in.
i
guess
they
could
have
fought
their
way
to
come
in
but
they
didn't.
they
stood
in
the
doorway
quietly,
there
was
no
indication
that
they
talked
to
any
of
the
--
any
of
their
customers
who
brushed
and
elbowed
their
way
by
them.
there
was
no
cursing.
there
was
no
fighting
or
riot.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
that
is.
and
then
entirely
apart
from
the
abatement
argument,
we
argue
that
cole
v.
arkansas
requires
a
reversal.
the
tennessee
court
said
it
was
considering
the
case
stripped
of
any
questions
of
race
and
discrimination
so
the
act
of
complaint
was
still
unlawful.
they
--
they
made
an
arguendo
or
assumption
that
the
defendants
had
a
right
to
go
in
the
premises
solely.
they
didn't
assume
that
they
had
the
right
to
stay
there.
but
--
and
then
the
trial
court
examined
the
evidence
and
concluded
that
there
was
evidence
the
defendants
committed
a
breach
of
the
peace.
well,
this
was
exactly
an
opposite
theory
upon
which
the
case
was
–
that
upon
which
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
the
jury
was
never
told
that
the
proprietor
was
wrong
and
these
defendants
had
a
right
to
stay
there,
and
it's
totally
opposite.
there
was
no
charge
of
a
breach
of
the
peace
as
i
mentioned
that
carried
a
penalty
112
of
the
penalty
they
were
liable
to.
most
importantly,
i
think
the
defense
would
have
been
different
if
there
had
been
a
charge
that
these
defendants
having
a
lawful
right
to
enter
nevertheless,
it
was
illegal
means
of
self
help.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes
sir,
it
did.
but
what
the
trial
court
also
did
was
--
that
was
a
revision
of
the
actual
requested
instruction
which
appears
on
page
307
--
the
material
in
brackets
on
307
is
the
material
that
the
court
refused
to
instruct
and
he
refused
to
instruct.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
court
repeatedly
instructed
the
jury
that
this
restaurant,
the
bmw
cafeteria,
had
a
right
under
section
62-710
to
keep
out
negroes
to
feed
its
own
customers
and
to
exclude
negroes,
it
instructed
them.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
the
--
i
think
the
point
is
that
if
--
well
the
court
said
it
wasn't
a
crime
to
seek
service.
it
did
not
instruct
the
jury
that
the
defendants
had
a
right
to
serve.
it
instructed
them
the
absent.
the
--
it
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
we
do.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
an
additional
argument.
well,
we
have
an
argument
based
on
lombard
versus
louisiana
and
robinson
against
florida
that
specifically
relates
to
the
tennessee
act
to
prosecute
it
under
which
was
designed
to
encourage
segregation.
and
we
made
reference
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
9
to
administrative
regulation
which
required
segregation
of
restaurants
and
this
was
the
regulation
that's
quoted
in
this
court's
opinion
in
turner
versus
memphis
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
held
invalid,
that
regulation
was
held
invalid
by
this
court
a
few
months
before
this
event
took
place.
but
we
submit
that
the
theory
of
the
robinson
case
at
least
as
much
state
involvement
as
it
was
in
the
robinson
case.
now,
i
left
the
last
point
a
bit
too
early.
one
of
the
thing
i
wanted
to
mention
was
that,
if
the
defendants
had
been
apprised
that
trial
of
the
state's
theory
that
the
--
that
the
state
argues
now
right
to
be
there
but
it
acted
then,
then
perhaps
the
counsel
would
have
had
entirely
different
case.
he
would
have
been
--
he
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
rely
on
his
fourteenth
amendment
state
action
argument.
and
he
might
have
thought
of
necessary
to
put
on
the
defendants
to
testify
and
deny
this
case.
but
a
decision
not
to
do
that
was
made
under
an
entirely
different
case.
in
conclusion,
i
would
submit
that
the
actions
of
these
petitioners
were
not
materially
different
from
the
actions
of
the
petitioners
in
25
other
sit-in
cases.
now
this
court
has
reversed
to
vacate
convictions
in
the
past
four
terms.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
yes,
that
the
factual
situation,
your
honor,
describes
--
it
was
exactly
the
fact
situation
in
blow
v.
north
carolina.
petitioners
were
waiting
outside
the
outer
doorway
of
a
restaurant.
the
court
reversed
those
convictions
last
month.
