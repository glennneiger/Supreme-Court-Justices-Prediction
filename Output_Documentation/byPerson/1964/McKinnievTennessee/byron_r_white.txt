justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you
a
question
please
before
you
leave
that
other
--
what
is
the
acp's
origin
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
‘64
in
this
regard?
how
much
self
help
is
a
negro
entitled
to
use
in
attempts
to
enter
a
restaurant
to
secure
service
which
the
act
is
in
the
right
to
have
when
he
approaches
a
restaurant
and
he's
met
at
the
door
by
a
private
bouncer
who
says
you
can't
come
in.
how
much
self
helf
at
that
point
the
negro
is
entitled
to
use?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
he
is
entitled
to
use
violence
to
try
to
get
in
and
i
suppose
you
can
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now
he's
inside
the
restaurant
in
the
vestibule.
i
suppose
that
is
inside
the
restaurant.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
much
–
is
he
entitled
to
stay
there
for
as
long
as
he
wants
to
exactly?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
stay
there
and
the
people
in
the
vestibule
could
have
stayed
there
as
long
as
they
--
as
the
restaurant
was
open,
as
long
as
they
were
being
denied
the
right
which
--
let's
assume
it
happened
today.
they
could
stay
in
the
vestibule
as
long
as
the
restaurant
was
open
and
since
they
had
a
right
to
enter
the
restaurant
and
get
service?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
was
blocked?
what
if
there
were
so
many
people
in
the
restaurant
--
they
are
in
the
vestibule
that
no
one
could
get
through
and
didn't,
and
people
were
prevented
from
getting
through.
now
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
i
think
they're
not
really
interested
in
blocking,
they
are
interested
in
getting
in.
they
didn't
get
in
the
vestibule
but
the
result
was
that
the
people
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
blocking
is
really
irrelevant
in
your
mind
but
in
any
event
–
there
was
enough
blocking
here
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
in
addition
to
the
argument
of
the
civil
rights
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
same
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
nabrit,
would
it
make
any
difference
in
this
case
that
the
events
in
the
year
took
place
in
the
vestibule,
what
if
the
same
events
that
taken
place
just
outside
the
outside
door
that
it's
not
the
people
were
up
in
outside
the
outside
door
with
the
same
and
the
120
pound
bouncer
was
placed
at
the
outside
doors
and
--
but
the
negroes
who
wanted
to
be
in
crowded
around
the
door,
we
just
--
it's
the
same
situation.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
the
obstruction
there.
it
was
more
of
a
picketing.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron

(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
turbulence
and
violence
adhere—
justice
byron
r.
white
--
over
the
rotation?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
its
physical
force
i
gather
in
your
view
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
stand
there
in
such
way
that
the
access
of
aggressors
prevented
by
people
going
in
and
out,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
fox
certainly
in
turn,
we
treated
that
very
regulation,
the
violation
of
it
is
a
misdemeanor
and
as
a
general
applicability
to
all
restaurants
and
hotels
in
the
state
of
tennessee,
you're
suggesting
you
don't
know
whether
that's
the
law
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
the
way,
we
treated
it
the
statutes
is
now
authorized
a
division
of
inspection
so
far
the
issue
of
such
rule
and
regulation
and
make
violation
for
such
regulation
for
misdemeanor
and
the
regulation
promulgated
by
the
division
provides
that
you
just
read.
restaurants
catering
to
both
white
and
negro
patrons
should
be
arranged
till
each
race
was
properly
segregated
and
we
certainly
treated
it
in
that
case
but
what
would
some
concession
on
the
court
of
tennessee
in
that
case,
it
should
be
so
treated
at
least
on
the
part
of
the
--
i
should
say
as
a
statute
of
general
applicability.
justice
byron
r.
white
were
you
suggesting
that
assuming
the
court
hadn't
already
passed
on
this
regulation
and
the
regulation
was
in
existence
at
the
time
of
these
events,
would
you
have
any
doubt
that
this
case
ought
to
be
reversed
on
lombard
if
the
regulation
was
enforced
which
required
--
which
at
least
gave
the
state
to
put
some
pressure
upon
restaurant
owners
to
give
segregated
service?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
suppose
it
was
imposed
after.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
march
1st,
‘63
that
was
after.
justice
byron
r.
white
after
this
conviction
but
and
after
turner.
justice
byron
r.
white
turner
was
before
the
events
happened
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
about
6
months
before
this
was
october
21,
1962
turner
was
decided
march
26,
1962
so
it
took
them
a
few
months
before
they
formally
to
get
this
out
of
the
books.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
it
took
them
a
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
fox,
i
take
it
that
you
concede
that
well
maybe
you
don't
concede
it
but
if
these
events
had
happened
after
the
passage
in
1964
civil
rights
act,
i
take
it
you
would
still
be
here
on
the
same
theory
namely
that
while
the
negroes
had
a
right
to
service
they
didn't
have
the
right
to
this
kind
of
self
help.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
then
consequently
make
the
same
argument
as
far
as
abatement
is
concerned.
justice
byron
r.
white
consequently,
i
would
think
you
would
make
the
identical
argument
in
regard
to
peterson
and
lombard
because
those
statutes,
those
holders
certainly
do
anymore
for
a
negro
seeking
service
in
the
civil
rights
act
and
whatever
peterson
lombard
was
to
give
the
negroes
the
right
to
do
and
what
are
their
ever
freedom
from
state
compulsion,
it
wouldn't
give
them
a
freedom
to
use
a
particular
degree
or
brand
of
self
help
and
so
all
the
questions
reduce
to
the
same
issue
was
there
the
kind
of
conduct
by
the
negroes
here
which
took
them
outside
the
protection
of
either
civil
rights
act
of
64
or
peterson
or
lombard,
isn't
that
really
the
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
let
me
ask
you
one
other
thing.
the
indictment
here
in
this
case
charges
that
the
defendant
formed
a
block
within
the
vestibule
was
any
customers
and
patrons
from
the
street
from
coming
out
that
said
conspirator
did
further
attempts
to
force
their
way
inside
the
main
cafeteria
section
did
push
around
and
shove
white
patrons
therein
which
conduct
continues
to
appear
more
in
30
minutes.
now
is
there
any
evidence
to
support
that
charge.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
think
that
that's
true?
tennessee?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
trial
court
never
charged
the
jury
at
all,
that
it
was
essential
to
find
any
kind
of
turbulence
of
violent
conduct.
the
only
--
this
case
instructed
on
was
the
injurious
to
trade.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
correct?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
agree
and
supreme
court
of
alabama
currently
or
tennessee,
excuse
me
agreed
there
must
be
some
turbulent
conduct
if
you
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
that
is
essential?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
it
wasn't
submitted
to
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
tried
to
find
out
once
before
that—
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
thing
the
judge
keeps
saying
that
you
must
find
that
these
defendants
did
confederate
unlawfully
to
commit
acts
injurious
to
the
restaurant
business,
trade
and
commerce
but
that's
--
and
you
said
that
two
or
three
times
without
ever
saying
that
turbulence
or
violence
is
of
any
necessity
in
the
case
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
assume
that
it
isn't
what
difference
does
that
make?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
true
but
that
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
violence
or
physical
conduct?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
where
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
just
the
reading
of
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
as
close
as
you
can
go?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
now
did
the
alabama
or
the
tennessee
supreme
court
--
what
does
it
conclude
about
this
conduct?
they
characterize
it
as
they
make
a
finding
that
on
this
record
they
were
guilty
of
some
kind
of
force?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
never
think
that
the
evidence
supports
the
charges
in
the
indictment
that
they
were
trying
to
force
their
way
into
the
restaurant
or
that
they
were
pushing
white
customers
around?
does
anybody
ever
in
either
court
indicate
that,
that
actually
occurred?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
judge
ever
found
out
--
page
317
says
that
the
evidence
shows
the
blocking
and
that
blocking
and
in
blocking
the
defendants
were
pushing
and
shoving
to
some
extent?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
an
effort
to
enter
the
restaurant?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
it?
