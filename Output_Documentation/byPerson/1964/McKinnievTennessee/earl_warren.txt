et
al,
petitioners
v.
tennessee.
mr.

you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
complaint
say
that
these
three
statutes
were
violated?
chief
justice
earl
warren
conspiracy
to
do
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
it
state
what
statute
it
was
violating?
is
that
the
violation
of?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
nabrit,
your
time
has
expired
but
you
may
take
until
12
o'clock
when
we
recess
and
the
counsel
may
ask
five
minutes
for
it
to
decide.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.

chief

chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
find
anything
what
you
mean
with
this
but
was
this
a
clear
error
on
the
part
of
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
your
supreme
court
say
about
that
error?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
unless
you
have
a
typographical
error?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
always
shown
under
your
statement.
i'm
talking
about
the
statement
at
all
that
was
shown
was
that
these
people
went
there
and
they
conspired
together
to
go
there
only
for
the
purpose
of
going
in
and
remaining
to
come
near
with
that
bringing
new
--
except
just
remaining
even
though
ordered
to
get
away.
would
that
violate
the
state
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
didn't
your
statute
says
that
these
regulations
of
the
department
had
the
force
of
law
and
a
violation
of
them
was
a
misdemeanor.
