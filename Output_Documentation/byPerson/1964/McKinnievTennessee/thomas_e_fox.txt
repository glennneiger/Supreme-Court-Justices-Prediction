mr.
thomas
e.
fox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
indictment
in
this
case
refers
to
it
as
a
sit-in
case.
i
submit
that
that
is
not
exactly
correct
because
this
is
not
a
sit-in
case
or
if
it
were
a
sit-in
case,
we
wouldn't
have
any
case
under
the
arthur
hamm
versus
rock
hill
case
and
under
the
blow
versus
north
carolina.
we
insist
that
the
conduct
of
the
defendants
in
this
case
was
violent,
turbulent,
and
righteous,
in
accordance
with
the
definition
that
was
set
out
in
the
case
of
feiner
versus
new
york
or
in
the
case
of
senn
v.
tile
layers
union
that
came
along,
i
believe
just
prior
to
1940.
in
those
--
from
those
definitions
especially
the
tile
case,
we
understand
that
that
acts
are
violent,
that
acts
are
not
peaceful
that
they're
forceful
and
not
non-forceful
as
referred
to
in
the
hamm
case,
if
physical
force
is
used
in
order
to
accomplish
the
purpose
of
the
people
making
the
demonstrations
or
the
people
that
were
charged
with
the
offense.
now
in
this
case,
as
was
stated
by
my
worthy
opponent,
there
is
a
vestibule
at
the
bmw
cafeteria
in
nashville
tennessee
which
is
from
the
evidence
from
about
6
feet
by
6
feet
or
6
feet
by
4
feet.
the
witnesses
disagree
or
differ
a
little
bit
as
to
size
of
this
vestibule.
on
sunday
at
noon
at
the
time
when
there's
a
big
crowd
of
people
eating
at
the
restaurant,
these
eight
petitioners
who
were
defendants
originally
came
to
that
restaurant.
they
say
for
the
purpose
of
acquiring
food.
they
moved
into
the
vestibule,
the
eight
of
them,
and
i
submit
that
that
just
about
filled
it
and
were
confronted
with
the
doorman
to
the
effect
that
this
--
that
the
restaurant
only
served
white
people
and
that
they
couldn't'
be
served,
and
they
were
asked
to
leave.
they
didn't
leave.
they
didn't
say
anything
out
of
the
way.
my
opponents
insist
that
they
were
peaceful.
we
think
that
we
insist
that
--
or
i
insist
that
there
being
there
in
the
vestibule
preventing
people
from
leaving
or
entering
the
restaurant
at
will
and
there
is
an
onset
some
entered
and
some
left.
some
had
to
squeeze
through.
some
had
to
make
them
after
they
get
them,
the
eight
petitioners
to
move
over
before
they
could
--
before
they
could
move
at—
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no,
your
honor,
there
is
not
except
we
insist
that
--
the
verdict
to
the
jury
finding
the
defendant
is
guilty
as
were
charged
in
the
criminal
case
warrants
the
inference
or
--
or
the
--
the
finding
by
the
jury
that
their
conduct
was
violent
or
that
it
was
forceful.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
your
honor
please,
we
--
we
think
so—
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
this
statute
39-1101
is
a
conspiracy
statute.
it
has
seven
parts
the
--
these
defendants.
the
conspiracy
was
charged
under
the
letter.
that
is
a
statement
or
requirement.
it
requires
that
acts
be
injurious
to
trade.
now
the
other
section
of
the
code
that
was
talked
about
is
62-711,
one
of
the
other
sections
the
court
just
talked
about.
that
section
of
the
code
makes
it
unlawful
for
any
person
to
engage
in
turbulent
or
riotous
conduct
about
a
restaurant
or
hotel.
it
i
think
on
the
indictment
is
no
more
than
the
overt
act
that
is
necessary
to
show
a
conspiracy
and
that
statute,
that
overt
act
must
be
a
turbulent
riotous
act
in
order
to
constitute
the
conspiracy
in
this
case.
there
have
been
certain
--
there
has
been
only
one
conviction
under
the
later
section,
the
court
mentioned
62-711
that
was
the
lester
case
that
my
opponent
mentioned.
that
was
the
case
where
an
indictment
was
motion
to
caution
indictment
which
was
granted
by
the
trial
judge
was
reversed
by
our
supreme
court
back
in
1877.
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1875.
the
court
observed
in
that
opinion
and
i
don't
have
any
way
of
--
i
went
back
to
the
archive
to
find
out
whether
or
not
this
defendant
in
the
lester
case
was
a
negro
or
whether
he
was
a
white
person.
i
wasn't
able
to
ascertain
that
fact
but
the
court
observed
this.
they
said
that
this
act
is
generally
supposed
to
have
been
enacted
to
offset
the
results
or
the
effects
of
the
civil
rights
act
that
was
passed
by
the
united
states
congress
in
1875.
no,
i
don't
say
that
it
was
intended
to
nullify
that
act
and
i
don't
think
that
our
supreme
court
in
1875
would
have
said
or
in
1877
in
our
legislature
in
1875
would
have
enacted
a
statute
to
nullify
an
act
of
congress.
i
think
the
legislature
could
proceed
that
because
of
the
civil
rights
act
that
was
passed
by
congress
in
1875
that
there
would
be
some
turbulent
conduct.
there
would
be
some
--
some
--
some
people
that
were
unhappy
about
the
situation.
and
i
think
this
act
was
adopted
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
the
owner
of
the
restaurant
of
the
hotel
to
deal
with
the
situation
without
regard
to
color
of
the
skin.
that
if
any
person
were
there
in
the
premise
of
the
hotel
or
the
restaurant
acting
in
a
turbulent
or
riotous
way
that
the
owner
of
the
hotel
would
have
a
right
to
bring
an
action
against
him
not
only
a
criminal
offense
but
also
to
bring
a
civil
action
against
him
for
damages.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
your
honor
please,
they
were
charged
that
if
they
conspired
to
injure
the
trade
of
the
bmw
cafeteria,
by
entering
into
turbulent
or
riotous
conduct
that
they,
of
course,
would
have
made
out
the
defense.
now
i
believe
that's
in
substance
of
what
the
statement
of
the
elements
of
the
offense
--
the
essential
elements
of
the
offense
were.
i
like
to
say
this
about
the
statute
62-710
the
civil
statute
that
a
good
deal
has
been
set
about.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
62-710
that
is
the
civil
rights
or
civil
statute
that
abrogated
common
law
rule
to
authorize
the
owner
of
a
hotel
or
restaurant
to
treat
it
i
believe
as
his
own
private
place
of
abode
that
he
could
let
in
or
otherwise
people
according
to
his
own
choosing.
that
section
is
included
in
the
indictment.
we
insist
--
or
the
state
of
tennessee
insists
that
the
purpose
of
including
that
was
to
show
to
help
show
a
conspiracy,
a
conspiracy,
of
course,
under
the
law
in
our
state
and
i
think
on
the
rules
that
are
set
down
by
this
court
can
be
determined
from
the
circumstances
from
the
relationship
of
the
parties
and
other
circumstances
of
that
sort
even
though
there
is
no
formal
agreement.
well,
this
statute
the
purpose
of
stating
the
contents
of
that
statute
in
the
indictment
was
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
these
defendants
had
in
mind.
they
knew
about
the
situations
of
restaurant
it
has
alleged
an
indictment
that
was
generally
known
and
it
says
in
the
indictment
that
they
were
sit-in
cases
occurring
at
other
restaurants
so
that
is
one
of
the
elements
of
the
conspiracy.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
it
said
this.
the
court
after
reading
the
three
sections
of
the
code
then
began
to
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
excuse
me,
the
indictment.
the
indictment,
as
i
remember,
it
says
this
that
these
defendants
conspired
to
enter
trade
by
sitting
in
or
by
acts
that
were
turbulent
or
riotous
under
16-711
knowing
that
it
was
the
position
or
the
hotel
--
not
the
hotel
but
the
restaurant
had
the
rule
of
serving
only
white
people
pursuant
to
the
statute.
it
says
under
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
the
court
after
reading
the
three
statutes
involved
then
began
to
talk
about
the
three
statutes
referring
to
it
by
number
39-1101,
62-710
and
62-711
as
if
they
were
all
for
the
same
purpose
because
the
court
immediately
after
referring
to
the
three
numbers
would
say
that
the
defendant
violated
these
statutes
by
committing
acts
that
were
injurious
to
the
restaurant.
and
so
we
insist
that
it
was
clearly
an
error
in
an
oversight.
and
we
insist
further
that
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
in
saying
that
the
defendants
violated
62-710
because
clearly
they
didn't
violate
that.
they
couldn't
have
violated
it.
it
was
only
a
civil
statute.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
in
three
different
places,
your
honor
please,
and
i
have
them
marked
at
the
top
of
page
299,
your
honor
please.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
at
the
bottom
of
page
302,
your
honor
please.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
and
then
near
the
close
at
the
bottom
of
page
305.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
302
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
at
the
bottom
page
305.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir,
we
admit
that
the
court
made
error
including
section
62-710
along
with
the
other
statutes,
and
said
that
if
you
find
the
defendants
violating
these
three
statutes,
he
should
left
out
that
the
middle
in
the
62-710.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir
we
think
so.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
your
honor
please,
i
believe
that's
correct.
yes
sir.
that's
a
--
that's
a
circumstance
to
show
that
the
defendants
intended
what
they
did
that
that
was
a
part
of
the
conspiracy
that
is
the
purpose
of
that
being
an
indictment.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
the
supreme
court
agreed
with
my
argument
that
it
was
in
a
nature
of
typographical
error
and
that
the
jury
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
we
just
say
that
it's
obvious
the
trial
judge
made
an
error
in
referring
to
that
statute
as
indicated
for
one
reason
per
se
and
that
is
that
he
filed
it
by
saying
that
if
the
defendants
committed
acts
injurious
to
trade
that
he
just
didn't
mean
to
include
that
in
that
indictment
or
that
he
shouldn't.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
they
agreed
it
was
error,
yes
sir.
and
we
--
i
made
both
those
arguments
below,
if
the
court
please,
that
it
was
in
the
nature
of
typographical
error
that
everybody
could
–
it
was
obvious
to
everybody
and
that
no
objection
was
made
to
it.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir,
that's
indicated
in
the
record
but
i'll
admit
that
i
had
forgotten
that
i
knew
it
until
you
put
it.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir,
the
record
indicates
it's
given
and
out
of
the
question
that
a
discussion
of
that
particular
request
and
instructions
so
far
as
i
know
had
never
been
made
before.
this
is
the
first
time
in
my
knowledge
that
its'
really
been
noticed.
but
the
record
certainly
shows
it
was
given
that's
my
construction
of
the
record.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
violent
or
use
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
or
use
some
physical
force.
we
think
that
the
facts
clearly
show
that
the
defendants
used
physical
force
to
accomplish
their
purpose
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
sir?
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir,
i
don't
remember
exactly
let
me—
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please,
i'll
back
off
from
that
a
little,
i
don't
recall
that
the
court
really
did
say
what
--
what
it
was
--
i
think
they
did
and
i
believe
i
can
find
it
because
there
are
lists
of
definitions
here.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir
we
think
so.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir
we
--
and
we
think
about
turbulence
and
violence,
it
means
the
use
of
physical
force,
if
they
used
physical
force
to
injure
trade.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
blocking
the
door.
we
think
by
remaining
they
did
block
the
door.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
this
court
please,
i
think
it
would
on
those
circumstance
because
it
would
--
it
would
block
the
entrance
by
staying
or
remaining
where
they
did.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir
they
blocked
it.
we
think
now
--
we
think
that
going
inside
and
sit
down.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no
sir,
we
don't
have
this.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no,
sir
not
that
i
know
of,
it
wasn't
discussed
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please,
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
know
whether
we
have
such
a
statute
or
not
unless
--
of
course
under
62-711
there
has
to
be
a
turbulent
or
riotous
conduct.
the
reference
was
made
to
what
this
court
said
about
our
statute
and
our
restaurant
regulation
in
the
case
of
turner
v.
memphis.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
--
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
well,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
we
--
we
think
that
the
case
of
senn
versus
tile
layers
union
of
wisconsin
case
in
which
this
court
discussed
the
wisconsin's
statute
is
authority
for
our
insistence
that
if
there
was
physical
force
used
to
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
and
blocked
the
entrance.
if
they
remained
there,
i
think
it's,
it
couldn't
have
been
--
you
have
to,
you
can't
escape
the
conclusion
that
the
blocked
entrance
had
to
remain
there
because
it
was
6x6
or
6x4
and
there
were
8
people
in
it.
and
the
proof
does
show
that
they
effectively
blocked,
not
effectively
but
blocked
it
to
the
point
that
people
had
some
difficulty
squeezing
through.
there's
a
big
group
of
people
inside
to
point
it
out.
there's
a
big
group
outside.
it
was
not
clear
whether
they
wanted
to
go
in
or
would
just
--
just
bystanders
or
site
seers.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
well
i
didn't
put
it
in
my
brief
if
the
court
please
but
in
the
webster's
dictionary
it
means
violent
and
we
think
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir
for
15
to
20
minutes
or
25.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir,
and
so
far
as
i
know
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i
have
thought
about
that
question
considerably
in
the
hamm
case
the
arthur
hamm
jr.
versus
rock
hill
and
in
the
elton
cox
cases,
i
don't
think
the
word
turbulent
is
used
but
the
word
riotous
and
the
word
violent
is
used.
and
although
i
could
--
i
thought
we
made
those
two
terms
are
a
little
bit
too
vague
to
determine
exactly
what
they
meant.
then
i
found
that
this
court
had
used
those
words.
and
i
think
used
them
just
in
there
ordinary
sense.
and
so
we
think
we're
entitled
to
that
--
that
same
use
of
them
or
at
least
in
this
case
that
--
that
those
were
--
that
they
were
violent
and
riotous.
it's
so
well
known
what
those
two
words
mean.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i
don't
think
so
if
your
honor
please.
i
think
it
means
the
same
thing.
yes
sir
and
i
think
both
of
them.
i
think
the
use
of
physical
force
amounts
to
being
turbulent
or
it
amounts
to
being
riotous.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir
it
seemed
to
be
concede
by
my
--
where
the
opponents
that
if
these
people
had
used
force
to
push
on
through
the
door
that
they
wouldn't
be
covered
by
the
hamm
case.
and
i
think
in
the
elton
cox
case
that
that
that's
really
part
of
the
holding
in
that
case.
that
if
they
use
force
to
push
on
through,
that
they
wouldn't
be
protected
by
the
civil
rights
act.
now,
i
can't
see
any
difference
if
the
court
please
in
using
force
to
push
on
through
or
using
force
to
stand
at
a
place
that
will
eventually
cause
the
owner
to
open
the
door
and
let
them
through.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
we
--
we'd
like
--
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
your
honor
please
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir
i
think
that
might
have
been—
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
we
think
so
under
the
holding
in
ingram
v.
united
states
that
was
the
tax
case.
there
it
was
said
that
--
well
first
american
--the
tobacco
company
v.
united
states.
there
it
was
said
that
you
infer
the
criminal
act
from
the
acts
that
we're
doing.
you
don't
have
to
have
an
expression
of
it
or
anything
of
that
such
you
infer
from
circumstances.
now
in
the
ingram
case,
it
was
said
that
that
if
the
conspiracy
is
not
one
of
the
major
objectives
but
one
of
the
minor
that
it
no
less
is
still
a
conspiracy
that
is
punishable
as
i
understand
it.
in
other
words,
i
think
that
the
defendant's
first
objective
was
to
get
in
and
be
fed.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that.
but
when
they
were
not,
then
they
continued
to
remain
in
the
vestibule
and
block
it.
now
we
think
that
was
their
second
objective.
we
think
it
was
understood
between
these
eight
petitioners
because
of
their
conduct.
first,
they
all
--
i
think
the
record
indicate
that
they
all
knew
that
they
were
not
going
to
be
permitted
to
enter
that
was
common
knowledge.
i
think
the
record
indicates
that
i
maybe
wrong
but
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
that's
really
it
was
alleged.
that
all
happened
there
at
the
same
time.
that
all
happened
there
at
the
time
when
the
restaurant
was
crowded.
they
all
stayed.
they
all
performed
as
a
unit
or
as
a
team
throughout
the
whole
incident.
there
wasn't
many
questions
about
what
one
would
do
and
what
the
other
would
do.
they
all
acted
in
concert
but
those
are
the
words
that
i'm
trying
to
use
all
the
way
through
this
proceeding.
so
we
think
that
the
only
inference
that
can
be
drawn
from
those
circumstances,
i
thought
is
that
they
did
act
together
and
that
they
conspired
to
do
the
thing
that
they
had
done.
now,
i
would
like
to
mention
this,
the
case
of
turner
v.
memphis
that
had
to
do
with
the
house
down
at
the
airport
at
memphis
tennessee.
as
my
opponents
understand
that
case,
they
say
that
this
court
declared
section
62-710
unconstitutional
and
a
restaurant
regulation
that
we
had
in
effect
at
that
time
to
be
unconstitutional.
well,
i
don't
understand
that
case
held
that.
the
case
said
this
that
there
was
a
question
of
whether
to
proceed
at
that
time
or
to
wait
i
believe
for
construction
of
that
code
section
and
that
restaurant
regulation.
this
court
said
there
was
no
use
to
see
what
the
results
that
was
because
that
statute
and
that
regulation
could
only
be
a
defense
insofar
as
it's
stated
an
affirmative
state
policy
to
segregate
and
they
said
under
that
and
then
added
on
their
cases
that
there
wouldn't
be
a
defense
because
it
just
couldn't
be
done.
so
we
don't
think
the
state
declared
them
unconstitutional.
it
just
said
that
if
they
were
sought
to
be
used
for
that
purpose
of
warning
the
acts
of
the
restaurant
and
segregating
it,
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
now
this
--
in
this
reply
brief
is
the
first
time
that
the
restaurant
regulation
has
been
mentioned.
i
take
it
that
if
it's
a
part
of
the
law
in
tennessee
or
if
it
were
a
part
of
the
law
the
state
could
take,
i
mean
this
court
could
take
judicial
notice
of
it.
at
least
this
is
the
first
time
it's
raised.
so
i'm
raising
the
question
about
whether
or
not
it
can
be
considered
farther
been
the
federal
court.
i
would
say
this
that
i
don't
know
whether
that
regulation
is
part
of
the
law
or
not
it
says
this
that
when
restaurants
are
open
to
both
white
and
colored,
they
should
be
served
separately.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that
sets
out
some
specifics
that
that
would
amount
to
a
compliance
with
it.
now
that's
the
effect
of
it.
well,
i
don't
know
whether
that
--
at
the
time
whether
that
is
--
has
the
force
of
law
or
not.
of
course
a
regulation
that
is
designed
for
that
purpose
does
have
but
i
would
like
to
say
this
that
one
mentioned.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
your
honor
please,
it
was
in
the
regulations
in
1961
and
in
1962
when
this
offense
was
committed
in
march
of
1963
it
was
taken
out
and
that
was
after
this
case
was
tried
but
it
was
never
mentioned
so
i
don't
think
anybody
ever
noticed
it.
except
i
would
think
this
that
the
restaurant
inspectors
tried
--
i
don't
know
there's
no
evidence
and
i
certainly
don't
know
i
think
that's
the
best
answer
that
i
can
give
to
that.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
except
in
march
1963
after
this
case
was
trialed
it
was
taken
out
of
the
regulation.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
not
before.
now
what
fact
was
given
to
it
during
that
time
i
have
no
knowledge
it
wasn't
brought
up
except
in
the
reply
brief
so
i
don't.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
the
restaurants
catering
to
both
white
and
negro
patrons
should
be
arranged
so
that
each
race
is
properly
segregated,
segregation
will
be
considered
proper
where
each
race
shall
have
separate
inferences
and
separate
facilities
of
every
kind
said
to
prevent
patrons
of
the
different
races
come
in
contact
with
other
in
entering
be
served
and
at
any
other
time
until
they
leave
the
premises.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir
that
was
in
effect
of
the
time
of
this
prosecution.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
well,
if
the
court
please
i
don't
know
what
that
requires.
they
way
it's
stated
there's
been
no
construction
of
it
and
i
don't
know
that
it
requires
them
to
comply
with
it.
it
says
what
he
should
do?
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
your
honor
please
from
reading
the
regulation
itself
i
don't
know
what
it
replies.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
your
honor
please,
the
way
i
understand
that
this
court
treated
was
that
if
it
did
amount
to
a
state
policy
to
segregate
that
it
was
unconstitutional
and
couldn't
be
used
as
a
defense.
now
i
don't
think
that
this
court.
i
didn't
understand
that
the
court
said
that
of
course,
i
may
need
to
read
it
again.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
if
the
court
please,
i
know
now
that
if
the
regulation
were
still
in
existence
it
wouldn't
be
that
nobody
would
enforce
it.
now
i
don't
know
what
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
after
turner?
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i
think
that's
when
it's
taken
off
the
books,
if
the
court
please.
i
think
it
was
--
if
there
was
a
letter
and
this
is
outside
the
record
as
i
said,
this
was
just
brought
up
at
this
time.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
turner
was
for
this
case
and
after
the
turner
case
was
decided,
then
our
restaurant
inspector
and
i
found
that
out
after
you
get
receiving
the
reply
brief
on
the
third
of
last
week.
i
asked
for
the
copy
of
the
regulation.
i
got
a
copy
of
the
regulations
and
the
attempt
of
the
--
or
the
effort
that
was
made
by
the
hotel
and
restaurant
inspector,
department
of
i
believe
it's
part
of
insurance
and
banking
department
on
our
state
i
don't
how
it
got
the
beat
or
that
part
of
it
but
we
do
have
some
statutes
on
hotels
and
restaurants
but
that
was
taken
out
in
march
1st,
1963.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
after
this
conviction.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
if
the
court
please
i
don't
know
anything
but
except
what
i
found
out
learning
that
we
had
had
such
a
regulation.
let
me
say
this
in
reply
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please,
i
don't
know
if
i
fully
understand
what
your
question
is
but—
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please
first,
i
don't
know
that
this
regulation
requires
that
from
the
wording
of
it.
now
second
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
sir?
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
it
sounds
like
it
does
but
as
far
as
i
know
it
hadn't
been
construed.
i
can't.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir
it
does
that.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i
believe
so
if
i
understand
your
question.
if
the
court
that
mr.
justice
black
further
in
response
to
your
question,
i
think
this
that
under
the
hamm
case,
even
though
that
--
maybe
i'm
going
too
far
but
i
don't
understand
that
a
man
is
permitted
to
take
the
law
in
his
own
hands.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir
absolutely.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please
this
would
be
my
answer
to
it
and
i
said
it
hadn't
been
construed
but
i
think
that
the
department
of
hotel
and
restaurants
or
the
people
in
the
charge
of
it
might
have
been
suggesting
that
it
would
be
encouraged
in
order
to
prevent
emotional
flair
ups
and
things
of
that
sort.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
i
went
back
and
read
that.
i
think
that
compels
it
though.
i
think
that
compels
segregation.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir,
we
think.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir,
i
think
though
that
our
supreme
court
said
that
i
think
in
their
opinion
that
this
respect
that
if
this
one
violent
conduct
or
if
this
one
the
use
of
physical
force
then
the
case
ought
to
be
reversed.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir
i
think
that's
correct.
we
have
compared
that
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
some
use
of
physical
force.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
we
think
so.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please
we
think
that
it
was
mainly.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please,
i
didn't
understand
your
--
i
don't
think
i
understood
your
question
at
first
but
i
do
now
and
i'm
looking
forward
i'm
not
sure
that
it
is
an
instruction.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please,
in
reading
section
62-711,
i
think
that
would
have
effect
of
the
instruction.
it
says
that
the
—
it
defines
what
is
meant
by
an
act
injurious
to
trade
and
that
was
read
by
the
court,
the
trial
judge
to
the
jury.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
your
honor
please,
we
think
that
when
you
say
turbulent
or
riotous
that
means
violence.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
the
passage
that
i'm
referring
to
is
at
298
where
it
says
the
person
guilty
of
turbulent
or
riotous
conduct.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
it
says
that's
what
they're
charged
with
the
violation
of
statute.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i
would
think
that's
as
close
as
the
trial
judge
got
to
it.
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
i
think,
i
can
find
it
on
page
324
and
325.
it
says,
“we
cannot
escape
the
fact
these
eight
defendants
were
blocking
the
entrance
of
the
doorway.”
and
we
think
that
by
blocking
is
equivalent
to
saying
they
used
physical
force.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir.
i
think
so.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir,
316
and
317
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes
sir
i
think
that's
it.
that's
as
near
as
we
have.
