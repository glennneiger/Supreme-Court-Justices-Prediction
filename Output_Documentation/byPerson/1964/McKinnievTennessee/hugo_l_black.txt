justice
hugo
l.
black
they
charged
the
jury
with
something
they
were
not
--
didn't
get
the
last
word.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible).
what
is
the
charge
against
that
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
were
attacking
edmond
on
the
ground
if
it
was
conveyed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
he
say
to
the
negroes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
vestibule
inside
the
restaurant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
inside
the
vestibule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
i
follow
you
correctly
--
if
i
follow
your
brief,
the
resentment
here
charged
the
violation
of
39-1101
which
is
a
conspiracy
statute
and
finding
it
to
commit
any
act
injurious
to
public
health,
public
morals,
trade
or
commerce.
and
then
it
charged
the
violation
of
62-711
penalty
for
riotous
conduct.
it
did
not
charge
although
it
referred
to
the
62-710
which
defined
a
right
of
owners
to
exclude
persons
from
places
of
public
accommodation.
now
one
of
your
points,
i
take
on
your
brief
and
what
you've
just
said
is
that
when
the
court
charged
at
page
299,
it
said
that
the
language
of
the
resentment
that
the
defendants
are
charged
with
the
offense
of
the
lawful
conspiracy
to
violate
code
section
39-1017
code
section
62-710
and
62-711.
and
you're
arguing
--
one
of
your
arguments
i
think
it
is
that
there
was
no
charge
of
conspiracy
to
deprive
one
of
the
right
which
the
statute
62-710
purported
to
give
to
an
owner
a
right
to
exclude
persons
from
places
of
public
accommodation.
and
therefore
under
court
of
arkansas
there
couldn't
be
convicted
because
they
were
being
convicted
of
a
charge
which
was
not
lodged
against
it.
is
that
a
correct
statement
of
the
position
of
that
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
mean
to
say
that
complete
obstruction
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
these
people
numbered
8
as
they
went
in
this
small
vestibule
that
they
were
permitted
to
do
and
people
could
--
other
people
could
come
in
and
out
if
the
management
permitted
them
to
enter
into
the
main
dining
room.
therefore,
there
was
no
complete
obstruction
as
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
indicated.
they
were
standing
there
in
a
peaceful
way
you
say,
don't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
state
said
that's
the
crux
of
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
people
they
say
and
it
would
be
a
violation
of
their
act.
it
would
not
be
protected
by
the
civil
rights
act
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
sections
202
and
203
of
the
act,
the
civil
rights
act
if
you
have
put
this
in
the
appendix
to
your
brief.
and
i
take
it
that
you
correctly
appeal
and
what
you're
saying
is
that
they
didn't
need
to
get
congregated
in
the
vestibule.
they
met
under
section
202
of
this
act
applies
to
seek
service.
and
then
the
deprivation
occurred
under
section
203.
and
then
it
is
the
persons
denied
them
or
instructed
them
in
their
right
to
seek
service.
and
then
you
joined
to
these
statutes
in
our
hamm
decision.
do
you
say
that
that
was
an
abatement?
would
that
be
a
correct
description
of
what
you're
trying
to
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
nabrit,
i
have
to
quarrel
here
a
little
bit,
if
you
look
at
page
311
of
the
record,
did
not
the
court
submitted
a
revised
chart
to
a
jury
saying
that
leading
it
was
not
a
criminal
offense
to
the
state
of
tennessee
for
negro
and
white
persons
who
serve
food
together
who
entered
into
a
criminal
offense
for
negroes
to
peaceably
seek
to
be
served
food
in
the
place
which
offered
the
service
to
the
general
public?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
was
then
--
what
was
then
the
defect
in
the
court's
instruction?
the
court
said
that
these
defendants
had
a
right
to
peaceably
to
seek
service
and
it's
not
a
criminal
offense
for
whites
to
have
them
together.
now
what
was
the
element
to
support
in
your
opinion
omitted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
a
constitutional
argument
or
it
relates
to
your
abatement
of
the
civil
rights
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
the
--
what
does
the
indictment
charge
as
to
62-710?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
indictment
i
say
and
not
the
court,
but
the
indictment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
what
did
the
--
what
did
the
court
instruct
so
far
as
67-627
--
all
of
those
concerns?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
error
in
an
oversight?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
did
the
court
say
about
62-710
where
will
we
find
that
in
the
record
the
exact
instruction
of
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
be
sure
about
to
argue
upon
--
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
this
conviction
could
not
be
sustained
under
your
state
law
unless
there
was
evidence
to
show
that
the
conspiracy
was
to
do
something
turbulent
or
what's
the
other
way
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
violent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
the
state
had
in
its
-â€“
turbulence
or
violence,
and
the
charge
or
anything?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
say
it
means?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
refer
to
physical
force
has
remained
over?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
you
have
to
add
to
that
then
with
this
blocking.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
any
statute
against
that
specifically
in
tennessee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that
was
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
no
such
statute
in
making
the
case
going
in
another
person's
property
against
his
will
or
remain
there
against
his
will?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
trouble
myself
this
time
unless
you
have
some
kind
of
definitions
of
the
statute,
that
would
make
me
believe
that
there
was
a
turbulence
in
a
regular
sense,
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
that
something
is
disorderly
or
destroying
and
disturbing
the
situation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
conduct
so
to
speak
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
you
mean
if
they
--
they
remained
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
turbulent
is
a
pretty
thing
on
the
terms
on
it
and
the
meanings
on
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
when
you
speak
of
violence
in
a
general
sense
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
pushing
or
hitting
or
forcing.
here
you
have
what
seems
to
be
from
the
record
that
seems
going
in
there
with
a
purpose
of
staying
there,
you
didn't
get
it
to
stay
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
did
stay
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
all
the
statutes
that
you
have
covered
it
in
this
statute
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
say
about
its
vulnerability,
if
it's
vague
and
uncertain
and
ambiguous
to
justify
permanent
provisions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
used
as
a
law
to
compel
these
things?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
no
evidence
that
it
was
repealed
or
anything
of
that
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes
but
not
before
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
this.
we
held
in
several
cases
eagleson
v.
lombard
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
there
was
a
state
law
compelled
or
required
for
segregation
that
matter
so
far
as
state
action
was
concerned
and
you
couldn't
enforce
this
other
law
against
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
on
this
report
that
your
brief
took
the
position
that
a
conspiracy
is
different
from
individual
actions
which
left
me
in
somewhat
of
quandary
have
i
misread
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i'm
talking
about
before
we
get
to
the
hamm
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
a
statute.
you
have
a
law
based
on
the
hamm.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
makes
it
unlawful
in
the
state
that
people
eat
together
while
they
are
in
the
restaurants.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
we
know
that
the
state
couldn't
then
claim
as
a
man
were
not
state
action.
if
this
is
state
action
you
agreed
onto
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
why
isn't
the
state
action
regulation
--
shows
a
state
policy
which
would
be
rested
on
or
least
expected
of
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
had
one
complied
with
labor.
