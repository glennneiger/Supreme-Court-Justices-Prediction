great
number
of
what?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
the
record
shows.
isn't
it
that
the
doorman
was
there
to
keep
out
negroes?
justice
potter
stewart
another
point,
i
just
wanted
to
clear.
your
point
is
that
the
conduct
here
on
this
record
would
be
conduct
which
today
would
be
lawful
under
the
civil
rights
act.
and
therefore
under
the
policy
of
abatement
would
also
be
also
be
lawful
at
the
time
it
occurred,
is
that
it?
and
your
--
well
how
did
you
--
do
you
get
or
raise
any
constitutional
claim
on
this
one?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
jury
charged
as
to
the
elements
of
the
crime
that
they
must
find?
justice
potter
stewart
the
resentment
of
62-710
is
referred
to
on
the
top
of
page
3
in
the
record
but
simply
as
saying
that
the
owners
of
the
said
cafeteria
reserved
the
right
not
to
admit,
i'm
excluding
said
cafeteria,
any
person,
any
owners
for
any
reason
whatsoever
chose
not
to
admit
and
they
said
under
the
provisions
of
section
62-710,
so
that
would
be
just
descriptive
right?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
only
mention
of
it
in
the
resentment
as
you
know
of,
i
can't
find
it
anywhere
else?
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
connection,
mr.
fox,
i
notice
that
what
your
statute
says
the
use
of
the
word
violence,
says
turbulent
or
riotous
conduct.
justice
potter
stewart
are
they
different
things
turbulent
conduct?
justice
potter
stewart
it
sounds
like
it
does?
justice
potter
stewart
it
sounds
like
it
does.
justice
potter
stewart
but
we
have
to
conclude
though
it
ends.
it
shows
a
policy
doesn't
it
as
far
as
segregation
and
record.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
how
do
we
know
that,
that
wasn't
the
reason
the
man
was
actually
active
in
this
case.
