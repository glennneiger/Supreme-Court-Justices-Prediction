didn't
they
also
look
to
the
intent

be
able

get
their
patronage

other
than
what
you've
shown
as
where
the
manager
told
them
to
leave
the
premises
as
distinguished
from
the
lunch
room?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
are
they?
chief
justice
earl

for
any
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
citation
you
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
now
on
28,

say
they
refused
to
leave
the
premises.
it
just
doesn't
say
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
--
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument,
i
won't
pursue
it
any
farther.
chief
justice
earl
warren
proceed
in
your
own
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
according
to
the
policeman,
the
two
policemen
who
were
standing
across
the
street
when
the
manager
and
his
assistant
approached
them,
they
complained
that
they
had
colored
boys.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
all.
they
had
colored
boys
over
there,
and
what
that
does
mean
if
it
doesn't
mean
that
they
were
concerned
about
them
because
they
were
colored?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
of
their
color?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
about
--
how
about
all
your
other
restaurants
at
that
time,
did
they
or
did
they
not
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
white
and
colored?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
this
--
let
me
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
ask
you
this,
a
little
different
attack.
if
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
had
been
in
effect
at
that
time,
would
this
store
have
been
covered?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
call
them
demonstrators
because
they
wanted
to
eat
because
then
white
people
wanting
to
go
there
to
eat
would
he
have
objected
to
them
filling
the
dinning
room?
