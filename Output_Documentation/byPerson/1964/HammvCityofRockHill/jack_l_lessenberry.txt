mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i,
with
the
attorney
general
and
his
staff
of
course
represent
the
respondent
in
this
action.
i
think
it
proper
that
i
mention
at
the
outset
that
any
lack
of
convincing
quality
in
the
brief
from
my
oral
argument
i
hope
it
is
not
based
upon
reasons
or
authority
thereof
but
maybe
my
own
in
that
missing
--
the
feeling
that
every
young
advocate
may
have
at
his
baptism
before
this
court.
i
think
that
petitioners
and
their
several
eminent
counsel
ought
to
be
congratulated,
perhaps
envied
on
the
magnificent
job
they've
done
in
both
the
preparing
their
brief
in
this
effective
oral
presentation.
but
i
necessarily
disagree
with
them.
i
think
it
proper
that
certain
aspects
of
the
record
before
this
case
be
emphasized
before
i
embark
on
the
argument.
this
case
does
involve
a
privately
owned
--
it's
a
family
privately
owned
department
store.
it
does
have
a
mezzanine
tearoom
that
does
serve
luncheons.
and
i
certainly
didn't
mislead
--
intend
to
mislead
mr.
justice
stewart
by
saying
they
just
serve
salads,
they
do
have
light
luncheons
in
there.
but
if
you
can
imagine
at
just
very
briefly
this
is
the
type
of
place
where
during
the
serving
hours
a
young
lady
comes
out
and
models
sweaters
and
skirts
and
other
female
attired
to
their
customers
that
are
seated
there
wherein
they're
almost
all
women
that
use
this
facility.
now,
these
demonstrators
came
in
and
they
weren't
just
five,
they
were
five
there
perhaps
when
mr.
holt
came
back
or
came
upstairs.
but
there
were
15
or
so
demonstrators
who
came
here
and
they
strategically
placed
themselves
across
this
narrow
entrance
at
the
tables
and
at
the
counters.
they
were
courteously
asked
to
leave
by
the
store
personnel.
they
refused
to
do
so.
they
want
to
question
and
argue
with
the
store
personnel.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
to
leave
the
premises,
leave
the
store.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i've
made
several
references
and
i've
been
--
i
attempted
to
mark
them
during
miss
motley's
statement.
i
made
reference
to
them
in
my
brief
on
page
30
of
the
record.
it's
question,
“but
i'm
saying
that
you
are
positive
that
they
were
--
told
you
they
were
refused
to
leave”,
referring
to
the
petitioners
here,
they
answered,
“they
said
that
they
have
been
asked
to
leave”.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
40.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
assume
the
store.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes.
i
think
that
it
does,
i
sincerely
and
honestly
think
so.
that
statute
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
--
was
submitted
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
so
found.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
there's
a
complete
void
and
absence
to
testimony
that
based
to
that
--
the
assistant
superintendent
or
the
manager
said
to
any
of
these
petitioners,
“we
want
you
to
leave
this
mezzanine
tearoom”.
there's
no
testimony
to
that
extent.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes,
i
agree
with
you
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
and
i
think
it's
certainly
explainable
mr.
justice
brennan.
in
pulaski
county,
i
think
there
are
perhaps
25%
colored
population,
i'm
sure
there
were
a
number
of
people
in
the
store.
and
it
was
the
purpose
of
this
officer,
and
correctly
so
under
his
sworn
duty
to
ascertain
that
these
were
the
ones
that
had
violated
the
law,
had
refused
to
leave
the
premises
and
that
those
were
the
ones
at
the
lunch
counter.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes,
and
that
was
one
of
the
three
references
or
two
references
found
in
the
petitioners
brief.
i
don't
think
that
this
court
or
any
court
is
going
to
be
concerned
with
the
niceties
of
one
phrase.
this
is
a
part
of
a
national
concerted
effort.
the
attorney
general
or
the
solicitor
general
on
his
brief
in
bell
v.
maryland
recited
that
there
were
over
20,000
demonstrations
of
this
sort.
mr.
goldberg
--
greenberg
has
said
that
there
were
some
3000
cases
pending.
there
are
two
from
arkansas
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
don't
know
where
the
rest
of
them
have
come
from.
but
i
can't
imagine
that
anybody
honestly
believes
that
theses
demonstrators
were
ingeniously
ignorant
of
their
rights
here
and
in
fact
to
use
the
phrase
from
this
court
quoted
arrest
here.
they
intended
to
violate
this
particular
act.
two
weeks
previously,
there
had
been
a
demonstration
of
some
50
persons
and
that's
consolidated
in
this
case,
briggs
versus
the
state
in
the
lower
court.
50
demonstrators
had
been
across
the
street
bulwarks.
is
it
remarkable
that
the
same
counsel
appears
in
cases
in
south
carolina,
florida,
alabama,
arkansas
and
louisiana?
these
cases
were
violation,
they
were
flagrant
violations
of
the
law,
and
i
(inaudible)
--
i
think
the
record
supports
me
but
as
a
practical
matter
and
certainly
we
must
look
to
what
the
intent
of
these
people
were.
they
intended
to
violate
the
law
and
they
did
so.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
suspect
mr.
chief
justice
that
if
there
was
a
qualification
to
the
store
manager's
order
or
request
to
leave,
that
he
would've
stated
it.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
suspect
that
if
the
store
manager
simply
qualified
or
desired
to
qualify
the
request
to
leave
he
would
have
so
stated.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
the
petitioners
didn't
say
anything
about
it
and
i
--
i'm
sorry
but
i
can't
get
that
connotation
from
page
40.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
think
that's
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
--
that's
simply
correct.
they
refused
to
leave
the
lunch
counter.
he
had
asked
them
to
leave,
this
doesn't
mean
to
my
way
of
thinking
that
they
were
only
to
leave
the
lunch
counter.
they
had
refused
to
leave
the
lunch
counter.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
oh
--
well,
i
think,
and
i'm
very
pleased
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
you
brought
that
up
because
i
think
that
affirms
the
state's
proposition
here.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes.
and
that
is
that
the
--
well,
may
i
explain
this
time
element
and
then
go
to
that.
these
people
in
the
store
when
the
demonstrators
came
in,
went
through
a
sort
of
a
chain
of
command,
the
employees
saw
the
people
there,
they
telephoned
the
assistant
manager
and
if
i'm
not
mistaken
he
had
to
come
up
from
the
basement.
and
that's
when
he
asked
several
of
the
boys,
the
record
sustains
they're
a
group
of
boys,
not
just
one,
to
leave,
and
when
they
refused
then
he
went
to
see
mr.
holt.
the
police,
and
of
course,
you
have
to
know
the
geography
here
of
4th
and
main
streets
in
little
rock,
but
he
had
to
go
across
the
street
to
women
bank
and
trust
company
to
find
two
police
officers
and
bring
them
back.
the
reason
that
they
were
arrested
is
that
they
were
still
in
the
store.
and
none
of
these
other
demonstrators
were
arrested
because
they
had
left.
these
people
attempted
and
did
continue
to
violate
the
request.
they
said
they
were
there
to
buy
some
shades,
which
i'm
thinking
as
the
jargon
of
some
sunglasses,
i
think
the
testimony
reveals.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
think
that's
explained
absolutely
mr.
justice
goldberg
later
on.
they
said
they
were
near
the
elevator.
the
elevator
is
in
the
middle
of
the
store.
they
were
directed
to
come
out.
the
petitioners
themselves
said
they
were
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
--
purchasing
some
shades.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
it's
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
it's
difficult.
in
my
short
tenure
of
being
an
attorney
or
trying
to
be
an
attorney,
i've
never
seen
any
record
that
you
could
go
to
one
page
or
one
area
of
examination
or
cross-examination
and
not
be
able
to
pick
out
something
that
supports
you.
but
this
case
is
contrary
that
it's
replete
as
mr.
greenberg
has
said,
it's
replete
with
the
opposite
to
my
--
to
at
least
to
my
way
of
thinking,
i
respectfully
submit.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes,
and
i
think
that's
the
reasonable
version
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
--
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i'm
not
mr.
--
i
don't
--
i
can
look
that
up.
i
made
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
--
reference
to
about
three
or
four
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
--
quite
heard,
i
mentioned
there
was
some
more.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
have
logged
here,
some
pages
here.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
page
30,
did
i
note
there?
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
did
i
mention
page
28?
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
here's
another,
excuse
me.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
found
another
one
by
the
way.
about
four
or
five
questions
down
from
the
top
of
the
page,
question
“did
they
state
to
you
that
they”
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
page
28,
i
believe
that's
the
one
you
asked
me
about.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
additional.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
well,
on
page
28,
there
is
one.
question,
“did
they
state
that
they
had
refused
to
leave?”
“yes
sir,
they
answered”.
page
44
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
well,
i
certainly
apologize,
it
certainly
not
my
position
to
--
and
i
think
it'd
be
incredible
if
i
were
to
try
to
put
something
over
on
this
honorable
court.
the
question,
“did
they
state
to
you
that
they
had
refused
to
leave?
answer,
“yes
sir”,
this
is
a
reference
to
the
question
of
the
officer
examining
the
petitioners
here.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
see
one
on
44.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
thank
you
sir.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes,
thank
you.
on
page
44,
the
question
--
let's
--
well,
no,
that's
--
excuse
me,
that's
sort
of
a
negative
presumption
or
so.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
that's
the
only
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
--
thing
i
can
get
out
of
this.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
in
--
pardon
me?
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
think
it
is
to
some
extent,
but
as
i
understand
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
--
the
south
carolina
stat
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes.
and
i
distinguished
the
bouie
case
on
this
basis
that
the
south
carolina
statute
required
a
fore
(inaudible)
--
warning
under
the
terms
of
the
statute.
i
think
that's
a
greater
burden
on
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
certainly
didn't
intend
to
argue
that
point
only.
i
did
intend
to
forcefully
state
that
they
did
intend
to
violate
the
statute
and
i
believe
they
did.
the
arkansas
supreme
court
so
found
and
reversed
about
eight
others,
that
they
found
didn't.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it.
i
think
what
the
--
stated
by
mr.
justice
black
if
i
may
--
and
mr.
justice
harlan
that
you
don't
trespass
on
just
a
part,
you
trespass
on
a
whole.
if
you
trespass
on
a
part,
then
that's
part
of
the
premises.
but
i'd
rather
not
deal
with
the
--
that
type
when
i've
got
a
record
that
i
believe
says
that
--
and
sustains
that
these
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
--
people
were
told
to
leave
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
then
i
accept
that
proposition.
i
think
it's
a
sound
legal
proposition.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
only
thing
i
could
find
in
the
record
was
an
information
that
have
been
filed
in
the
municipal
court
and
it
only
alleges
a
violation
of
act
226
and
act
14,
it
doesn't
use
particular
terms
to
describe
that
violation.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes,
of
course
it
does.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes.
it's
my
understanding
that
a
warrant
was
not
issued
in
this
particular
case
either
because
it
occurred
in
their
presence
where
they
admitted
the
violation.
i
don't
think
that
a
warrant
was
issued.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
not
that
i
know
of
sir.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
the
--
there
are
some
argument
concerning
the
instructions,
i
think
the
court
read
to
the
jury
the
statutes,
but
i
don't
know
that
all
of
the
instructions
are
set
out
here,
i'm
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes.
as
to
immediate
advance,
i
don't
think
that
someone
can
trespass
for
a
few
minutes
with
impunity.
i
think
that
the
request
of
the
manager
here
did
demand
that
these
people
leave
immediately.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
think
that's
--
i
think
you're
more
familiar
with
the
record
than
i
am
mr.
justice
but
i'd
say
this,
i'm
not
too
sure
that
that
was
what
was
given
or
if
that
was
a
request
of
instruction.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
it
was
the
court's
instruction.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
there
was
an
alternative
apparently
put
by
the
judge
to
the
jury
that
leaving
the
premises
though
was
included.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
if
i
might
leave
the
question
of
the
record,
i'm
--
ask
permission
to
proceed
to
discuss
some
of
the
other
points
that
are
--
discuss
some
of
the
other
points,
legal
points
that
i
think
are
most
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes
sir.
in
the
case
of
(inaudible)
v.
kraemer,
if
a
person
could
stay
at
a
retail
establishment
for
five
minutes
or
ten
minutes,
if
we
must
deal
in
those
time
--
periods
of
time,
then
as
in
(inaudible)
,
a
person
could
be
bodily
hauled
out
of
the
store.
it
required
immediate
advance.
i
think
there's
an
annotation
a.l.r.
which
is
consistent
to
that.
i
might
say
as
to
sufficiency
that
there
was
a
motion
for
direct
(inaudible)
--
directed
verdict
that
was
made
in
this
case
but
it
only
went
to
the
disturbing
of
the
peace
cases
and
not
the
question
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
in
this
case.
under
procedural
rule
in
arkansas
of
course
that
is
necessary.
the
sufficiency
was
attacked
on
appeal
on
arkansas
supreme
court.
this
is
entirely
new
i
believe.
i'd
like
to
discuss
of
course
the
civil
rights
act
and
its
effect
or
possible
effect
on
these
prosecutions.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
no.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes,
i
agree
with
that
and
no
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
--
they
were
not
denied.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
don't
know
how
the
state
supreme
court,
i've
read
this
record
half
a
dozen
times
and
i
see
no
reference
whatsoever
to
raise
in
the
record,
except
the
supposition
of
the
petitioner
robinson
on
cross-examination.
mr.
prosecutor
frank
codd
to
ask
him,
“do
you
know,
why
you
were
asked
to
leave?”
and
he
said,
“i
really
don't
know,
i
suppose
it
was
because
of
our
color”,
but
that's
the
only
reference
to
raise
there
is
in
the
entire
record.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
improvidently
i
believe.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes
sir.
i
don't
want
to
get
it
back
home
that
i'm
criticizing
the
supreme
court
but
i
think
it's
quite
obvious
that
the
record
doesn't
sustain
that
these
petitioners
were
asked
to
leave
on
the
basis
of
the
record.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
do
i
personally
think
there
was
any
doubt
about
it?
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
suggest
the
reason
that
there
were
15
or
20
demonstrators
wearing
badges
coming
up
there
and
sitting
in
a
line
of
tables
across
the
entrance
to
this
mezzanine
tavern.
i
think
whether
they
were
white
or
colored,
anything
else
that
demands
or
under
those
circumstances
would
--
could
exercise
his
private
prerogative
of
ordering
these
petitioners
to
leave
and
refusing
them
service.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
will
say
this
that
i
personally
believe
at
that
time
that
blass
did
not
serve
negroes.
i
don't
know
that.
i
don't
know
if
any
had
asked.
and
i
know
that
they
served
negroes
at
this
time
as
most
all
of
restaurants
in
(inaudible).
i
mean,
even
prior
to
the
civil
rights
act,
this
happened
in
1960.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
well,
i
can
say
--
i
can
say
this
that
such
a
record
to
this
court
probably
means
that
these
people
who
were
per
se
bad.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
and
in
my
--
it's
my
impression
--
but
to
me
--
from
little
rock
and
living
in
a
community
of
different
ethnic
groups,
it
means
nothing
else
more
than
a
description
of
who
was
there.
i
just
don't
see
that
an
officer
or
a
store
manager
saying
that,
“we
have
colored
boys”,
means
that
that's
necessarily
bad,
and
i
don't
think
that
store
manager
intended
to
give
that
implication.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
there
were
some
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
there
were
some.
there
was
a
record
on
ninth
or
twelfth
street
that
were
serving
colored
and
white.
when
i
was
child,
well
(inaudible)
--
people
have
been
free
to
do
what
they
so
desired.
i
see
one
of
the
petitioners'
local
counsel
here,
as
reason
i
looked
back
and
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
--
if
i'm
misstating
that,
they
were
entirely
outside
the
record,
but
if
i'm
misstating
that,
then
he
can
clarify
it.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
think
probably
it
would
have.
the
tearoom
doesn't
advertise.
it's
a
very
small
place,
but
it
is
a
large
department
store.
and
i
mean
to
my
way
of
thinking,
my
understanding
of
commerce
clause
and
how
it's
been
applied,
i
think
it
properly
this
would
deal
an
interstate
commerce
probably
substantially.
i
don't
know
if
the
restaurant
does.
i
don't
know
if
there's
a
distinction.
i
believe
this
case
can
live
very
freely
with
the
civil
rights
act
although
i
don't
the
civil
rights
act
can
--
applies
here
at
all.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
believe
that
the
petitioners,
each
of
them
individually
by
two
different
people,
the
assistant
manager
and
the
store
manager
asked
each
one
of
them
to
leave
and
they
just
said
leave
or
get
out.
i
don't
think
that
they
were
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
the
charge
to
the
jury
--
administered
to
the
jury
made
by
the
court,
i
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
think
it's
an
alternative
the
court
says
here,
if
you
find
from
the
evidence
that
the
defendants
were
requested
to
leave
the
lunch
counter
or
the
restaurant,
they
just
limit
it
to
that.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
they
left
after
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
--
i
compute
20
minutes
or
15
minutes,
yes.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes
sir,
but
i
--
i
maintain
that
a
person
doesn't
have
a
free
time
that
he
can
call
(inaudible)
children
and
say,
“i'm
able
to
stay
in
this
restaurant
in
defiance
of
your
lawful
order
for
five
minutes
or
three
minutes
or
ten
minutes”,
and
that's
what
they
did
do.
it
requires
immediate
abeyance
under
(inaudible)
and
as
i
understand
the
majority
of
trespass
statutes,
and
every
state
in
this
union
has
trespass
statutes.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
would
say
immediately.
i
would
assume
that
that's
long
enough
to
get
the
things
that
you
might
have
there
together
and
leave.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
the
only
thing
that
i'm
able
to
discern
myself
is
that
after
they
had
been
requested
by
the
store
manager
and
after
he
had
called
mr.
holt
and
mr.
holt
came
up
--
excuse
me,
the
assistant
superintendent,
after
the
store
manager
came
up,
mr.
holt,
he
again
asked
one
of
them
then
he
left,
went
out
of
the
building
across
the
street,
got
two
police
officers
and
came
back.
sometime
in
his
absence,
they
were
leaving.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
disagree
with
the
use
of
the
word
in
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
--
intercepted.
they
were
there,
i
believe,
standing
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes,
they
were
in
a
position
to
leave.
i
think
they
were
in
one
in
the
quarters,
one
was
saying
that
he
was
looking
at
some
shades.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
though
that
after
--
upon
the
request,
upon
two
different
requests
they
said,
“well,
what
for
or
why,
we're
not
going
to
leave.
i
want
to
argue”,
and
did
argue.
then
i
suppose
for
a
period
of
time
that
being
seen
critical
for
the
prosecutor
that
--
below,
and
i
honestly
don't
think
it's
too
critical
here
now
that
they
stayed
there
anytime
after
they
answered
these
two
lawful
requests.
i
want
to
skip
a
significant
portion
of
my
argument
and
move
over
to
the
statement
concerning
the
application
of
203
(c)
and
that
is
as
i
read
the
notes
or
the
brief
of
the
petitioners,
they
say
that
there
isn't
retroactive
application
of
the
civil
rights
act.
they
admit
that
initially,
but
then
they
say
that
203
(c)
prohibits
punishment,
shall
prohibit
punishment
and
they
would
say
it
this
time.
in
other
words
they
would
admit
or
say
to
this
court,
“we
agree
that
this
was
a
criminal
act
and
that
there
is
a
valid
prosecution
and
that
there's
no
retroaction
as
far
as
the
affirming
state
court
conviction
but
on
the
other
hand
you
cannot
now
convict
them”.
i
think
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
punish
them.
that's
the
point.
in
other
words
you
would
deprive
from
the
entire
legal
process
the
thing
to
be
gained
in
punishment
from
this.
it
makes
legal
procedure,
a
criminal
procedure
a
mockery
and
nothing
more
than
a
farce
to
my
way
of
thinking
at
least.
they
say
and
make
a
very
emotional
argument
that
if
these
punishments
are
to
be
permitted
that
this
would
be
a
last
vestige
of
segregation.
and
they'd
acted
--
the
national
conference
has
said
that
these
persons
should
not
be
convicted.
but
if
it
please
the
court,
the
national
conference
did
not
provide
for
retroaction,
congress
could
have
done
that,
they
did
not.
the
national
conference
in
true
terms
was
actually
not
in
sympathy
with
these
petitioners.
if
they
were,
it
would
create
a
dual
system
of
justice
to
my
way
of
thinking
simply
for
the
benefit
of
these
petitioners.
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
which
dramatically
points
this
out.
this
court
denied
certiorari,
i
think
back
in
1949,
when
the
federal
statutes
were
changed
to
--
from
permitting
imprisonment
for
rape
at
either
death
or
life
imprisonment.
after
the
charge,
it
went
back
for
retrial
and
they
argued
that
the
jury
be
instructed
to
provide
for
a
lesser
term
of
years
that
the
court
be
so
--
the
jury
be
so
instructed.
the
court
refused
to
do
so.
i
think
there's
a
significant
difference
in
a
man
being
fined
$500
and
given
30
days
and
not
permitting
the
jury
to
give
him
some
term
of
(inaudible)
--
years
but
serving
a
life
imprisonment.
there
are
numerous
analogies
here
--
the
violations
of
the
emergency
price
control
act.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
at
this
statute
that
we
could
twist
it
so
it'd
have
federal
origin,
it
would
not
have
been
abate
--
abated
under
the
federal
saving
statute.
i
don't
believe
that
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
has
given
such
an
interpretation
that
we're
going
to
treat
states
one
way,
and
federal
laws
another
way.
i
want
to
say
something
about
historical
prejudices
in
arkansas
in
the
south.
i
can't
help
but
fel
something
personal
animosity
and
disappointment
to
deal
with
this
argument.
i
think
that
arkansas
and
it's
wrongful
that
arkansas
and
the
community
of
little
rock
be
condemned
for
some
unequated
statutes.
i
noticed
one
that
was
cited
by
the
petitioners
that
has
reference
to
separation
of
railways.
if
you
look
at
that
statute,
it
was
enacted
within
three
years
at
plessy
v.
ferguson,
and
one
that
--
and
it
held
that
--
what
this
court
hold
--
held
at
that
time,
i
think
a
real
fine
analogy.
it
was
mr.
greenberg's
statement
that
he
didn't
believe
that
the
provisions
of
the
national
prohibition
act
have
been
repealed
by
our
own
congress.
legislature
seemed
to
be
too
busy
trying
to
take
care
of
new
business
road
and
disposing
of
old
business
has
become
ineffective.
there
have
been
as
far
as
i
know,
even
the
little
rock
school
decision,
that
closing
case,
there
wasn't
any
federal
compulsion
of
the
little
rock
school
board,
they
implemented
their
own
plan
of
integration.
it's
only
because
of
the
disturbance
there
of
a
few
radicals.
look
at
those
cases,
i
invite
the
attention
of
the
court
to
see
those
cases
where
the
community
leaders,
the
chamber
of
commerce,
the
police
officers
all
acted
to
enforce
the
law
and
i
think
that
they
have.
i
can't
believe
that
this
court
would
tell
the
people
of
arkansas
that
we
will
take
judicial
knowledge
that
you're
prejudice.
psalm
11
says
--
its
kind
of
--
it
seems
to
me
appropriate
here
that
if
our
foundation
so
fall,
what
shall
happen
to
the
righteous.
i
think
there
are
some
righteous
people.
i
don't
think
it's
proper.
if
you
can
make
an
argument
of
vagueness
--
if
you
can
make
an
argument
of
vagueness
of
this
statute,
you
can
certainly
make
an
argument
of
vagueness
of
this
indictment
that's
brought
against
the
people
of
arkansas,
because
certainly
there
was
no
evidence
submitted
below.
there
was
no
proof.
there
was
something
--
some
mere
inference
in
their
motion
for
new
trial
they
wouldn't
even
argue.
and
if
this
had
been
a
jury
discrimination
case,
this
court
would
hold
consistent
with
its
holdings
in
hundreds
of
other
cases
that
these
matters
have
to
be
brought
to
the
state
court's
attention.
in
carter
v.
texas,
you
can't
just
file
a
motion
and
gain
proof
and
gain
a
reversal.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
it's
my
opinion
sir
that
arkansas
has
consistently
interpreted
their
savings
statute
as
generally
interpreted
in
sutherland
on
statutory
construction.
it
saves
its
--
it
abrogates
the
common
law.
these
people
could
still
be
prosecuted
even
if
they
were
in
some
face
of
state
procedure,
but
i've
searched
and
i
haven't
found
a
case
of
arkansas
which
said
that.
it
--
however
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
believe
that
it
--
i
believe
that
it
does.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
no,
i
don't
think
there's
any
conflict
even
in
the
federal
civil
rights
act
of
1964
and
the
trespass
law
of
arkansas,
act
14.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
think
the
existing
statute
covers
it,
but
i
--
the
--
as
far
as
i
know,
it
has
not
been
interpreted
by
a
case.
but
to
borrow
a
phrase
if
we
go
back
to
sutherland
in
statutory
construction
in
the
purpose
of
a
saving
statute
--
in
the
cases
in
federal
courts,
they
all
adhere
to
that
purpose
because
in
modestly
enough,
if
these
demonstrators
caused
its
congress
to
enact
a
civil
rights
act,
still
those
people
acted
imprudently
when
they
went
to
a
place
and
did
not
leave
after
they'd
been
advised
to
do
so.
i
want
to
talk
very
briefly
now,
if
i
may
in
regard
to
the
case
of
shelley
v.
kraemer.
i'm
not
absolutely
satisfied
to
simply
distinguish
shelley
v.
kraemer.
i
think
shelley
v.
kraemer
says
something
more.
i
think
shelley
v.
kraemer
confirms
the
fact
that
an
individual
has
a
right
to
discriminate
if
he
so
desires.
i
understand
shelley
v.
kraemer
to
say
two
or
three
different
things.
the
first
is
that
a
state
court
cannot
require
a
person
to
discriminate
if
he
does
not
wish
to
do
so.
also,
shelley
v.
kraemer
was
determined,
in
part
at
least,
upon
the
federal
given
right
of
colored
people
to
deal
in
property
as
white
men.
there
is
a
phrase
in
shelley
v.
kraemer
which
is
significant
to
me
and
that
is
voluntary
adherence
to
restrictive
covenants
is
not
constitutional.
isn't
that
an
individual's
right
to
discriminate
voluntary
adherence?
i
believe
that
it
is.
these
cases
are
not
like
marsh
v.
alabama
where
the
decision
can
rest
on
the
right
of
religion
or
the
smith
versus
allwright
or
terry
v.
adams
where
under
the
thirteenth
amendment
a
person
has
a
right.
they
are
not
cases
involving
at
this
time,
i
hope,
interstate
commerce
where
we
could
invoke
boynton
v.
virginia.
none
of
these
cases
and
none
of
these
principles
say
that
a
person
has
a
right
to
go
to
a
particular
restaurant
or
a
hotdog
stand
on
a
corner
or
a
mezzanine
tearoom
and
demand
service.
even
the
petitioners
in
their
brief
describe
it
as
some
sort
of
right.
they
don't
define
it
for
us.
and
then,
in
my
closing
moments
i
want
to
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes,
i
won't
presuppose
and
concede
that
the
civil
rights
act,
for
the
sake
of
this
argument
is
constitutional
in
all
respects
and
that
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
as
a
covered
establishment,
but
one
thing
further
and
i
think
this
is
most
significant
to
the
respondent's
argument
mr.
brennan,
these
persons
weren't
refused
on
the
basis
of
race,
color,
religion
or
those
items
set
forth
in
the
civil
rights
act.
i
believe
that
a
man
still
has
a
right
under
the
civil
rights
act
to
tell
a
particular
person
to
leave
his
restaurant
so
long
it's
not
within
one
of
those
prohibited
specifically
named
thing.
there's
a
principle
or
construction
that
--
when
it
list
a
statute
list
items
of
coverage,
it's
limited
to
those
items.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes
and
that's
all
i
have
before
this
court,
it's
the
record
that
was
made
by
these
petitioners
and
i
believe
it's
their
fault
if
there
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
no,
i
would
not.
i
think
remand
on
those
circumstances
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
pardon
me?
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
think
in
some
instances
it
has.
i
think
when
you
got
to
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i'm
answering
--
i
think
we've
got
to
face
up
the
facts
if
the
--
that
the
reason
in
my
belief
of
refusal
in
this
case
was
but
that
i
don't
know
--
i'll
qualify
it
this
way.
i
don't
know
if
one
negro
appeared
that
he
would
not
have
been
served.
i'm
convinced
that
the
presence
of
15
or
more
negro
demonstrators
wearing
badges
and
sitting
as
they
did
was
the
reason
and
that
race
played
a
substantial
part
in
the
denial.
but
blass
does
serve,
it
served
before
the
public
commendations
act
and
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
stated
in
our
brief
but
i
believe
it
would
be
an
exercise
of
futility
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
--
to
send
it
back
below
for
that
reason
alone.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
if
they
were
demonstrating,
yes.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
no,
i'm
trying
to
make
it
clear
that
race
played
a
substantial
part
in
it.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
but
the
record
doesn't
show
that
it
played
any.
i
--
you've
asked
me
to
be
completely
candid
and
fair
with
the
court,
and
i'm
giving
you
my
personal
opinion.
i
have
no
way
of
supposing
or
speculating
what
mr.
holt
had
in
his
mind
when
he
went
up
to
this
mezzanine
tearoom
and
found
a
crowd
of
demonstrators
lined
up
demanding
for
service
and
arguing
why
they
couldn't
get
service.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
your
honor,
i
didn't
--
i
don't
think
that
i
called
them
demonstrators
at
all
except
i
copied
their
words.
the
record
is
clear
that
these
young
men
said
that
they
didn't
even
know
each
other,
that
they
just
happened
to
be
there,
that
there
wasn't
any
concerted
effort
whatsoever,
that
they
didn't
even
knew
who
was
at
the
table
with
him.
but
now,
this
is
the
same
argument
that
was
made
in
arkansas
supreme
court,
but
then
as
i
noted
in
my
brief
at
the
statement
made
in
petitioner's
argument,
they
finally
admit
that
this
was
a
sit-in
demonstration.
and
yes,
i'll
accept
their
version
as
a
sit-in
demonstration.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
think
that
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
think
that
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i'll
say
that
about
the
same
token
i
know,
that
there's
the
purpose
and
design
of
this
court,
but
by
the
same
purpose
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
this
court
has
ignored
some
things
that
the
state
courts
have
held
and
actually
looked
to
the
record
to
find
out
what
had
did
happen.
and
as
long
as
this
court
finds
an
actual
violation
of
due
process
or
denial
of
equal
protection
laws,
it
has
not
hesitated
and
should
not
hesitate
to
act,
if
not
governed
alone
by
what
the
state
courts
says
or
remarks
as
far
as
the
facts
in
the
case,
i
don't
think
this
court
should
be
blinded.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
unless
they
--
the
construction
is
violative
of
due
process
or
equal
protection
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
think
perhaps
maybe
i
have
just
a
minute
to
talk
about
one
further
thing
here
and
that
is
extension
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
this
case
to
cover
other
than
what
has
been
known
as
state
action.
and
that
is
this,
after
remarking
that
state
custom
could
amount
to
state
action
or
that
judicial
action
is
state
action,
and
i
suppose
they
mean
more
than
state
action.
it's
state
action
which
denies
due
process
of
law.
then
they
asked
this
court
to
draw
a
new
line,
to
use
a
new
line,
but
if
we
do
this,
then
we
forget
the
fact
that
congress
submitted
one
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
states,
the
states
legislatures
accepted
those
fourteenth
amendments,
those
are
the
ones
that
should
be
applied
here.
one
remark
in
the
brief
is
very
important
to
me
and
they
say
that
this
court
and
the
courts
of
the
states
have
been
accidental
with
state
action.
i
ask
what
promise
does
their
radically
new
theory
of
individual
action
holds.
if
this
court's
been
accidental
in
the
past
with
state
action,
how
canit
be
any
more
certain
with
individual
action?
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
no,
i
think
they
said
accidental.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
in
their
brief.
on
page
69,
i'm
almost
positive,
this
is
their
--
rather,
this
is
--
no,
it's
not
--
that's
not
it,
it's
under
.2d
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
they
say
that
this
court
has
been
accidental
in
defining
what
state
action
is,
and
they
asked
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
and
they
suggest
if
you
enlarge
it
to
mean
individual
action
that
you
can
be
sure
that
by
such
meanings.
i
denied
if
they
can.
they
go
on
to
say
that
beginning
once
made,
these
cases
present
no
problem
for
they
are
very
long
way
at
the
line.
thus
petitioners
candidly
give
us
a
peek
into
the
twilight
zone
of
what
they
would
suppose
the
law
to
be.
and
of
course,
this
would
mean
that
mezzanine
tearooms
were
a
very
long
way
from
that
line.
this
is
too
forebode
--
foreboding
to
me
the
constitutional
rights
of
others
should
not
be
drowned
in
such
shallow
stream
to
afford
a
footstone
to
go
into
this
wilderness
of
legal
entanglements.
one
concluding
remark,
much
has
been
said
about
the
rights
of
property
and
property
rights
as
opposed
to
personal
and
individual
rights.
i
submit
to
you
that
a
table
or
a
chair
or
an
acre
of
ground
or
even
a
facility
does
not
possess
any
rights.
it's
the
owners
of
those
properties
that
have
those
rights.
we
can't
say
that
they're
not
individuals,
not
citizens
of
this
nation
that
have
property
rights
to
be
sustained.
the
--
these
rights
cannot
even
be
compared,
because
i
don't
believe
that
petitioners
have
shown
constitutionally
or
otherwise
that
there
is
an
actual
right
of
the
petitioners
here
to
be
protected.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
well,
i
never
mean
to
say
they
blocked
access.
i
mean,
they
were
just
--
when
you
went
to
the
tearoom,
there
they
were,
they
weren't
scared
about
it.
they
didn't
block
access
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
no.
the
only
thing
i
understood
and
i
thought
it
was
filled
out
a
little
more
elaborately
to
the
charge
to
the
jury
that
were
these
petitioners
guilty
of
refusing
to
leave
a
business
establishment
after
being
requested
to
do
so
by
the
manager.
there
wasn't
any
race
involved
in
the
charge
to
the
jury
and
--
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
i
can't
honestly
answer
that
mr.
justice
black.
i
would
assume
and
believe
knowing
the
prosecutor
mr.
justice
holt
that
he
simply
prosecuted
this
case
fairly
and
impartially
without
any
reference
at
all
to
color.
i
can't
imagine
that
we
don't
have
the
issue
of
color
here
simply
through
the
oversight
of
the
defense
attorney.
i
don't
think
it
would've
made
any
difference
to
the
jury
or
it
would've
made
any
difference
to
the
prosecutor.
i
think
we're
inferring
too
much
to
say,
“well,
the
fact
that
this
wasn't
forcefully
brought
out
that
he
refused
them
service
because
they
were
negroes
or
that
there
was
a
conviction
because
they
were
negroes,
is
an
unwarranted
inference”.
it's
an
assumption
should
not
be
made.
they
were
two
imminent
--
very
qualified
negro
attorneys
representing
them
in
that
trial
and
they
were
--
and
i
believe
to
my
way
of
thinking,
very
able
to
brong
--
bring
out
a
point
of
race
if
it
had
in
fact
been
true.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
well,
i
know
you
don't
want
me
to
say
it
was
overruled
because
you
know
it
was
overruled.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
no,
at
least
i
don't
know
that
there
were.
the
record
doesn't
sustain
it.
they
could've
offered
any
evidence
whatsoever.
it's
remarkably
like
carter
v.
texas
where
a
man
files
a
motion
for
new
trial
and
says
that
there's
jury
discrimination
and
your
petty
jury
panel,
but
i'm
not
going
to
offer
any
proof.
they
didn't
restrict
him
from
offering
proof
on
this.
a
record
would've
been
made
at
that.
this
is
little
rock
and
the
circuit
courts
there
are
fairly,
i
believe
enlightened
and
sophisticated
place.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
on
the
basis
of
race,
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
l.
lessenberry
yes.
i
agree
that
it
did.
the
motion
did
but
there
wasn't
any
proof
in
the
record
though,
nothing
that
i
know
of.
i
certainly
appreciate
the
courtesies
of
the
court
had
given
me
and
extended
me
and
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i'll
take
my
chair.
thank
you.
