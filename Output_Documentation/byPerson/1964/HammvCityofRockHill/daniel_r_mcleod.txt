mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
primary
concern
which
i
appeal
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
these
prosecutions
have
been
abated
by
the
enactment
of
the
civil
rights
act
is
whether
or
not
there
is
any
showing
whatsoever
as
to
whether
these
establishments
or
the
establishment
involved
in
the
hamm
case
was
in
fact
covered
by
the
provisions
of
the
civil
rights
act.
there
is
no
proof
whatsoever
with
respect
to
that
and
of
course
it
was
not
an
issue
because
these
prosecutions
were
made
in
1960.
the
only
evidence
that
can
be
gleaned
from
the
records
is
this
that
this
--
the
hamm
and
ivory
himself,
the
defendants
were
rejected
for
service
at
this
restaurant
in
1960
because
of
the
fact
that
they
were
members
of
the
negro
race.
it's
also
undoubted
that
the
restaurant,
the
lunch
room,
serves
the
general
public
and
that
is
the
extent
to
which
the
record
shows
that
mccrory's
comes
within
the
purview
of
the
civil
rights
act.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
justice?
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
and
(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
--
1960
--
well,
it
would
have
to
be
built
on
the
record,
i
mean
the
record
is
only
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
oh,
of
course
the
statute
itself,
civil
rights
act,
provides
that
it
must
serve
or
offer
to
serve
interstate
travelers.
and
i
submit
that
the
mere
proof
and
the
fact
that
they
offered
to
serve
the
general
public
is
not
an
offer
to
serve
general
interstate
travelers.
now,
that's
born
out
i
think
by
the
construction
as
given
to
the
act
by
the
only
two
cases
that
i'm
aware
of
which
were
--
that
have
arisen
under
this
act
and
which
why
i've
been
here
last
monday.
and
i've
only
had
access
to
one
in
a
brief
glance
at
the
one
from
alabama,
but
in
the
(inaudible)
and
in
the
alabama
case
apparently
gave
a
great
deal
of
consideration
to
showing
that
for
instance
no
inquiry
was
made
as
to
the
place
of
residence
to
the
person
who
presented
himself.
the
fact
that
advertisements
were
made
up
and
down
the
interstate
highways,
the
fact
that
the
restaurant
itself
was
on
an
interstate
highway
even
to
the
extent
of
obtaining
license
numbers
and
so
forth
to
see
if
out-of-state
license
--
licensed
automobiles
were
in
the
parking
lot
of
the
restaurant.
and
the
quantum
of
food
that
was
served
and
where
that
food
was
purchased
from,
none
of
that
appears
here.
and
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
the
decision
recites
that
the
plaintiff
and
the
united
states
contend
that
their
offer
to
serve
interstate
travelers
together
with
the
fact
is
unquestionably
did
serve
interstate
travelers
were
sufficient
to
bring
it
within
the
scope
of
the
law.
but
none
of
that
appears
here.
and
therefore,
we
submit
that
--
it's
clear
that
there's
no
showing
that
this
establishment
came
within
the
provisions
of
the
law.
that
was
naturally
not
in
question,
at
the
time
the
prosecution
(voice

--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
(voice

and
would
not
have
arisen.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
undoubtedly.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
oh,
yes!
you
mean
about
the
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
about
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
on
the
question
of
whether
it's
covered
within
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
--
the
purview
of
the
act?
on
the
basis
of
this
record,
there
is
indeed
a
question.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
oh,
yes
sir.
yes
indeed.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
second
clause
of
the
first
sentence
with
respect
to
affecting
commerce?
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
state
action?
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
oh,
the
same
thing
that
was
found
in
the
peterson
case
and
perhaps
in
the
garner
case,
i
think
it's
in
the
lombard
case
where
the
public
statement
was
made
by
an
--
a
responsible
public
official,
something
of
that
nature.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
there
is
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
where
the
custom
is
encouraged
or
enforced
by
the
state
or
political
subdivision
thereof.
no
evidence
whatsoever
to
that
--
with
respect
to
this
case.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
required
or
enforced,
i
beg
your
pardon,
and
posture
was
originally
in
the
in
the
act
as
it
went
through
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
--
it
was
eliminated.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
true.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
fourteenth
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
not
at
all.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
not
at
all.
for
this
reason
mr.
justice,
if
the
lesser
of
a
--
of
the
--
of
two
establishments
are
included
in
the
same
premises,
one
can
bring
the
other
within
the
scope
of
it,
the
larger
can
bring
the
greater
or
the
greater
can
bring
the
larger,
vice
versa.
but
that
is
applicable
as
i
construe
the
law
only
to
establishment
that
would
otherwise
come
within
the
scope
of
the
law,
the
damn
store
itself
is
not
within
the
purview
of
title
ii.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
about
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes
sir,
i
think
it
will.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
don't
--
(voice
overlap)
--
i
don't
know.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
see.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
would
say
that
the
facts
from
the
record
shows
is
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
on
the
actual
fact
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
well,
i
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
don't
know.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
none
at
all.
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
white
if
i
misunderstood
that
question.
there
wouldn't
be
any
question
whatsoever
in
my
own
personal
observation.
as
to
what
the
proof
at
that
time
when
you
--
when
the
justice
asked
me
with
respect
to
remand,
i
had
in
mind
remanded
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
think
it
is
the
only
question.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
speaking
from
my
own
personal
observation
and
i
would
assume
--
i
would
think
so.
no
question
in
my
mind.
the
facts
may
demonstrate
otherwise.
i
may
as
counsel
mentioned
a
moment
ago
have
a
--
show
that
they
had
an
intrastate
travelers
only
sign
there.
they
may
--
the
facts
may
show
that
the
question
thereof
--
the
clientele
as
to
whether
--
where
the
--
what
the
place
of
residence
was.
i'm
satisfied
from
my
observation
and
recollection
of
that
area,
i'm
fairly
familiar
with
it,
there's
no
advertisements
of
this
particular
dine
store
up
there.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
but
i
--
sir?
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
do
they
need
this?
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
well,
that
would
have
a
bearing
on
whether
they're
within
the
scope
of
the
law
or
not.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
and
again
i
can't
answer
the
question
without
some
degree
of
speculation
because
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i've
even
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
don't
think.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
no
sir,
no.
my
answer
to
your
question
i
misconstrued
it,
i'm
sorry,
was
remand
which
i
think
is
the
most
that
this
court
could
do
with
respect
to
this
case
for
the
determination
of
this
question
by
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina.
with
respect
to
the
application
of
title
i,
section
109,
the
saving
clause
of
the
federal
statutes,
i
agree
with
the
petitioner
that
there
is
no
precise
application
of
that
statute
here
as
i
see.
it
simply
means
that
when
an
offense
is
created
by
a
federal
statute
that
statute
is
repealed
on
a
pending
prosecutions
under
that
statute
are
abated
unless
--
or
will
not
be
abated
unless
congress
specifically
authorizes
their
abatement.
now,
applying
the
analogy
of
that
to
the
prosecutions
which
do
not
precisely,
as
i
say
fit
here,
i
feel
that
the
intent
of
the
congress
is
that
where
they
mean
for
a
prosecution
to
be
abated,
they
specifically
say
so.
they
have
not
said
so
here
on
the
contrary,
the
punishment
sections
is
specifically
worded
with
respect
to
the
future,
no
punishment
shall
be
imposed
or
exercised
of
these
rights.
i
feel
that
if
there
had
been
a
prosecution
under
a
federal
statute
similar
to
the
trespass
statute
of
south
carolina,
the
prosecutions
under
that
statute
would
not
have
been
abated
for
the
simple
reason
even
on
the
federal
jurisdiction
under
this
law
for
the
simple
reason
that
congress
did
not
specifically
designate
their
abatement.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
well,
i'm
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
--
i
frankly
--
i
don't
know
how
many
or
if
any
will
involve
the
application
in
the
civil
rights
statute.
i
have
no
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
--
no
knowledge
what
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
don't
know
how
many
are
involved
but
if
there
are
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
well
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
to
future
actions?
i
have
that
--
and
our
position
in
the
brief
is
with
respect
to
that
is
this.
under
the
present
circumstances
if
a
person
should
present
himself
for
service
at
a
--
in
establishments
that
are
covered
under
the
civil
rights
act,
the
proprietor
as
i
see
it
has
the
charge
of
doing
several
things.
he
can
serve
the
person.
he
can
decline
to
serve
that
person.
and
if
that
person
at
that
time
should
decline
to
leave
the
premises,
the
proprietor
then
can
allow
him
to
sit
there,
if
he
comes
in
there
6
o'clock
--
at
6
o'clock
in
the
morning,
he'll
remain
there
till
6
o'clock
that
night.
or
he
can
use
force
to
eject
him
as
apparently
would
be
permitted
under
south
carolina
law
and
fairly
similar
circumstances
with
the
similar
involvement
of
rights
or
he
can
prosecute
for
trespass.
and
our
--
trespass
is
our
position
that
under
the
trespass
statutes,
prosecutions
could
still
be
made
if
the
proprietor
should
decline
to
serve
a
person
who
is
otherwise
entitled
to
it
and
that
person
at
that
time
insist
upon
remaining
after
having
been
declined
to
be
served.
now,
our
position
on
that
is
predicated
on
the
holding
of
this
court
in
poulus
against
new
hampshire
where
the
application
for
a
religious
ceremony
or
religious
services
or
gathering
was
denied
and
improperly
denied
as
found
by
the
state
court.
and
this
court
stated
there
that
the
person
involved
should
have
gotten
his
license
or
followed
his
procedural
remedies
in
order
to
get
that
license
prior
to
exercising
his
rights
of
religion
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
without
having
to
procure
a
license
even
though
the
license
was
wrongfully
withheld
from
him.
and
we
submit
that
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
in
punishment?
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
well
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
--
in
the
first
place
that
is
with
respect
to
future
application
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that
in
all
frankness
gave
some
concern
to
me
in
formulating
this
matter
which
i
think
is
important
calling
the
court's
attention
for
a
future
guidance
of
my
state
as
well
as
other
states.
the
answer
that
we
foresee
on
that
is
this.
that
when
a
person
has
made
an
application
to
be
served
and
that
is
denied,
his
recourse
by
the
specific
terms
of
the
civil
rights
act
is
exclusive
under
the
provisions
of
title
ii
and
that
is
for
an
application
for
an
injunctive
relief.
and
that
is
a
remedy
which
he
should
follow.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
and
that
is
the
exclusive
means
afforded
him
under
the
specific
provisions
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that
was
--
in
view
of
the
department
of
justice
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
--
recited
by
senator
--
i
don't
know,
the
answer
to
that.
that's
the
view
of
it.
the
statute
itself
does
not
say
that.
and
the
person
in
that
instance
is
not
being
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
and
as
far
as
i
have
not
had
the
opportunity
to
survey
the
debates
because
they're
so
--
so
much
debate
that
was
incorporated
in
the
record
on
this
matter
and
i
am
not
aware
of
any
other
provision
that
will
shed
any
light
upon
it.
that's
the
construction
we
have
the
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
that's
true,
that's
true.
as
a
matter
of
practical
attack
upon
the
problem,
i
have
--
it
had
been
--
on
all
frankness
have
anything
to
do
with
my
legal
position
on
the
matter
but
i
have
advised
whatever
police
officers
that
i
have
jurisdiction
over
to
not
--
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
i
have
advised
whatever
police
officers
that
i
have
in
the
jurisdiction
over
not
to
make
any
prosecutions
under
this
on
the
theory
that
the
criminal
actions
cannot
be
used
as
a
mean
of
circumventing
civil
rights
act.
plus
the
fact
that
the
arrest
warrant
should
not
be
signed
by
the
police
officers
but
should,
if
an
arrest
warrant
is
going
to
be
gotten
be
procured
by
the
individual
who
operates
the
establishment.
now,
that
--
i
make
that
statement
just
as
a
matter
of
information
to
the
court.
i
don't
think
it
has
an
illegal
bearing
upon
the
matter
but
then
that
action
has
been
independently
undertaken
by
me.
now,
with
respect
to
the
custom
that
the
petitioner
refers
to,
the
statute
of
course
as
mr.
justice
stewart
mentioned
a
moment
ago
and
corrected
me
a
moment
ago,
it
requires
only
--
or
states
only
that
the
custom
must
be
required
or
enforced
by
the
state
or
political
subdivision.
the
word
fostered
encouraged
or
required
or
enforced
phraseology
of
that
nature
was
eliminated
during
the
course
of
the
passage.
there
are,
as
petitioner
states
in
his
briefs,
many
statutes.
in
my
state
which
do
relate
to
the
problem
of
matter
of
segregation,
the
statutes
are
detailed
at
length
there.
there
are
statutes
which
require
that
a
school
be
closed
if
a
child
is
admitted
pursuant
to
a
court
order.
a
constitution
in
the
state
requires
that
separate
schools
be
provided
for
children
of
separate
races
and
that
none
be
permitted
to
attend
the
school
belonging
--
provided
for
a
child
of
another
race.
but
those
statutes,
the
constitutionality
of
it,
of
course
is
manifest.
one
example
of
that
is
the
statute
that
has
never
been
passed
upon
by
a
state
or
by
a
federal
court,
the
constitutionality
of
that
as
i
see
is
manifest,
that
requires
a
separate
pay
windows,
separate
dippers,
separate
pails,
separate
restrooms,
separate
workrooms
be
provided
for
members
of
the
different
races.
i
have
advised
the
commission
of
labor
of
my
state
that
that
statute
is
clearly
unconstitutional
and
should
be
disregarded.
now,
it's
not
unusual
for
a
statute
where
there's
specifically
been
held
to
be
unconstitutional
or
not
to
be
kept
upon
the
statute
books
of
my
state
and
that
my
observation
in
any
other
state.
one
example
to
that
is
the
fair
trade
act
of
south
carolina
which
was
declared
unconstitutional
by
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
in
1957.
and
there
was
a
codification
of
the
decennial
codification
of
the
laws
in
1962
and
the
fair
trade
act
is
found
in
the
code
now.
it
has
no
effect,
no
force
and
i
submit
it
should
not
--
none
of
the
segregation
statute
should
be
given
any
effect
reflecting
any
official
state,
custom
or
encouragement
of
any
custom
with
respect
to
segregation.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
none
that
--
i
think
this,
there
is
one
that
would
--
with
respect
to
a
railroad
station
in
the
city
of
florence,
and
there
is
another
one
that
does
not
pertain
to
this,
i've
forgotten
what
it
is.
but
none,
ordinance,
statute,
constitutional
provision
or
anything,
there
is
nothing
on
the
statute
books
that
relates
to
segregation
being
required
by
law
in
this
particular
case.
the
police
captain,
apparently
without
any
urging
and
without
any
--
apparently
an
impromptu
bona
fide
response
said,
“well,
let
me
say
this.
it
is
my
duty
to
enforce
the
law
and
not
the
custom”.
and
we
submit
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
of
any
state
fostered,
encouraged,
required,
or
imposed
custom.
insofar
as
the
position
raised
by
the
petitioner
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
the
warrant,
we
submit
initially
that's
a
matter
of
state
law.
the
state
supreme
court
has
held
that
the
warrant
charge
one
single
offense
and
is
a
rather
confusing
record
as
counsel
stated
a
moment
ago,
because
it
was
agreed
that
the
record
in
the
ivory
case
to
be
used
as
record
in
the
hamm
case.
and
consequently
the
charge
to
the
jury
by
the
judge
is
not
appropriate.
some
provisions
of
the
warrant
itself
had
been
deleted
with
respect
to
the
hamm
case,
but
they
appear
in
the
transcript
of
record.
nevertheless,
it
appears
very
clear
that
only
one
charge
that
of
trespass
under
the
statute
involved
was
contemplated
in
the
warrant.
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
hamm
and
for
ivory,
mr.
samson
in
argument
before
the
court
for
a
motion
of
a
direction
of
verdict,
using
these
words,
“fails
or
refuses
without
a
good
cause
or
excuse
to
leave”,
indicating
that
he
had
just
one
single
statute
in
mind
when
this
was
submitted.
and
additionally,
no
question
of
the
application
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
raised
on
this
point
before
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
the
record
does.
the
record
is
factually
contradictory.
there
is
evidence
that
he
asked
them
to
leave
the
lunch
counter.
there
is
evidence
moreover
that
he
asked
them
leave
the
store.
the
record
on
page
78
reads
as
follows,
“and
did
not
the
manager
in
the
presence
of
the
officers
asked
you
to
leave
the
store?”
this
is
reverend
ivory's
answer,
“in
the
presence
of
the
officers,
after
the
officer
had
requested
them
to
do
so”,
and
further
on
in
(inaudible)
--
that's
indicating
--
clearly
that
they
meant
for
them
to
leave
the
store.
on
page
16,
“did
reverend
ivory
state
any
cause
or
reason
or
excuse
for
his
refusal
to
leave
the
premises
on

in

mr.

to

he
could

mr.

of

of
the

mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
in
the
middle
of
the
page
by
mr.
spencer,
“mr.
hunsaker,
other
than
the
matter
of

you've

mr.

mcleod
that's
right.
reverend
ivory
nor
arthur
hamm
neither
one
made
any
attempt
to
leave.
that
point,
captain
hunsaker
asked
him
if
he
understood
that
mr.
whitaker
had
told
him
--
what
mr.
whitaker
had
told
him,
and
then
he
repeated
what
mr.
whitaker
said
and
that
was
that
he
could
not
be
served,
that
he
would
have
to
leave
the
counter.

that's

mr.
daniel

and
it
was
clearly
a
factual
question.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
they
were
not
unwelcome
on
the
premises
on
that
portion,
that's
true.
mr.
daniel
r.
mcleod
now,
whether
the
fact
that
he
insisted
on
service
at
another
portion
prompted
the
manager
to
say,
“you've
got
to
leave
the
entire
store”,
i
don't
know,
he
apparently
was
trying
to
leave
because
they
wanted
a
refund
and
in
fact
did
get
one.
i
don't
--
the
record
--
there's
a
conflict
in
the
testimony.
there
may
be
a

if
i've
been
on
the
jury
i
would
probably
feel
that
he
had
not
been
ordered
to
leave
the
store,
but
i
wouldn't
--
the
court
can't
say
that
the
jury
is
compelled
to
reset
conclusion.
there
is
evidence
that
he
was
required
to
leave
the
store
in
its
entirety
--
entire
premises.
mr.
daniel

that's

mr.

other
than
those,
i
don't

bear
upon
the
point
of
whether
or
not
any
particular
evidence
that
shows
he
was
required
to

either
point
