mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina.
a
petitioner,
arthur
hamm
jr.
was
convicted
of
what
the
record
calls
“trespass”
in
the
recorder's
court
of
the
city
of
rock
hill,
south
carolina
and
was
sentenced
to
a
hundred
dollar
fine
or
30
days
in
jail
on
a
record
which
he
stipulated
would
cover
him
but
which
in
fact
was
the
record
of
the
reverend
ivory
who
was
a
cripple,
who
was
in
a
wheelchair
that
mr.
hamm
was
pushing
the
time
of
the
events
in
question.
pending
appeal,
reverend
ivory
died
and
this
case
continues
only
in
connection
with
mr.
hamm.
generally
speaking,
the
sit-in
demonstration
in
which
he
engaged
was
a
typical
one
quite
like
the
scores
of
cases
that
have
been
brought
to
this
court
and
the
perhaps
3000
cases
that
are
now
pending
in
state,
trial
and
appellate
courts,
many
awaiting
the
outcome
of
cases
in
this
court.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no
it's
not
your
honor
but
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
consulted
counsel
in
the
various
states
with
whom
i'm
associated
and
i've
compiled
figures.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
it's
reasonably
accurate.
i
think
perhaps
if
anything
there
may
be
somewhat
more
because
i
may
not
know
all
the
lawyers
though
i
think
i
do.
mr.
jack
greenberg
this
is
--
these
involve
only
sit-ins.
this
does
not
involve
parades
or
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
picketing
or
voting
rights
or
street
demonstrations.
i'm
merely
speaking
about
sit-ins
that
would
come
within
the
category
of
the
kind
of
case
we're
presenting
here
today.
mr.
jack
greenberg
disorderly
conduct?
this
would
include
breach
of
the
peace
and
trespass
for
what
i
would
call
a
sit-in,
in
other
words
sitting
at
a
counter,
standing
and
demanding
food
service
of
some
sort.
mr.
jack
greenberg
this
would
include
the
garner
type
situation
as
well,
as
the
peterson
type
situation.
both
have
been
used
against
it
and
though
the
breach
of
the
peace
statutes
very
rapidly
fell
into
disuse
after
garner
and
only
essentially
trespass
types
statutes
were
used,
but
there
are
some
breach
of
the
peace.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
greatest
number
of
trespass
cases.
mr.
jack
greenberg
to
19
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
almost
all
of
them.
there
are
now
--
there
are
a
few
from
saint
augustine,
florida
for
example
which
was
last
year
but
--
most
of
these
cases
are
like
this
case
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
1960
vintage,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
some
of
the
cases
are
being
held
just
awaiting
trial
to
see
what
was
going
to
happen,
but
i
would
say
most
of
them,
almost
all
of
them
involved
convictions
that
have
been
stayed
at
various
levels
who
are
in
process
and
haven't
been
stayed
but
haven't
--
go
way
up
yet.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
i
would,
providing
that
the
facts
were
something
that
are
covered
by
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
in
other
words,
i
would
look
at
essentially
what
occurred
not
the
type
of
reprising
that
was
used
against
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
perhaps
not,
but
it
think
these
record
show
and
i
would
imagine
that
if
the
record
tells
anything
at
all
about
what
happened
there
would
be
enough
evidence
to
show
that
the
facility
is
covered.
as
i
will
argue,
if
i
have
time,
if
a
place
is
open
to
the
public
without
any
restriction,
without
any
restriction
against
interstate
travelers,
in
other
words
if
its
anything
unlike
the
restaurants
they
had
for
a
brief
period
of
time
after
(inaudible)
and
that
said
intrastate
travelers
only.
we
would
submit
open
to
the
public
includes
intrastate
travelers
and
it's
under
the
act,
and
i
think
the
legislative
history
supports
that.
i
think
the
plain
language
supports
that.
so
if
there
is
evidence
that
this
is
a
food
establishment
open
to
the
public,
we
would
submit
and
strongly
urge
that
it's
covered.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
don't
think
the
solicitor
general
faced
that
particular
issue.
he
was
in
a
case
on
pleadings
and
on
a
record
in
which
essentially
the
question
of
substantiality
of
food
service
was
being
mooted,
but
i
don't
know,
that
he
would
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
not
take
that
position
yet.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
but
he
would
--
but
he
was
arguing
a
particular
problem.
he
was
the
defendant
in
the
case,
that
he
was
in
a
case
in
which
--
and
the
hotel
case
comes
into
another
section
which
doesn't
involve
this
consideration.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
say
yes.
my
argument
is
that
as
in
this
record
there
was
a
great
deal
of
questioning
of
the
manager
of
mccrory's
which
is
an
interstate
chain
that
--
sixth
largest
chain
in
the
country,
sells
3000
items
in
the
store
as
well,
as
the
lunch
counter.
he
said
that
he
admitted
chinese
and
other
orientals
and
indians
and
communists
and
in
other
words
there
was
no
restriction
whatsoever
as
to
the
public
and
they
offered
to
serve
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
he
did
not
say
that
explicitly.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
shows
that
at
one
point
a
substantiality
provision
was
offered
and
the
substantiality
amendment
was
defeated.
and
congressman
seller
in
speaking
--
in
opposition
to
the
substantiality
amendment
argued
that
if
this
were
incorporated
into
the
act,
the
act
would
then
not
cover
all
establishments.
that's
the
word
he
said.
i
can
refer
you
to
the
page
of
the
congressional
record,
and
would
not
have
the
same
coverage
as
the
acts
of
30
states
and
the
district
of
columbia,
i
think.
anything
else
would
be
an
anomalous
result
because
if
an
interstate
traveler
is
supposed
to
be
protected,
he
would
then
have
to
stop
in
front
of
an
establishment
unless
he
were
affirmatively
asked
not
to
come
in
and
have
so
much
conduct
pretrial
discovery
of
dimensions
you
might
have
an
antitrust
case.
however,
if
a
restaurant
keeper
wanted
to
so
structure
his
business
as
to
keep
negroes
out,
the
act
does
permit
such
an
eccentric
person
with
some
difficulty
to
setup
such
a
restaurant
and
running.
there
are
food
fad
restaurants,
vegetarian
restaurants,
the
persons
who
have
peculiar
diets
for
reasons
of
health
or
reasons
of
religion
and
they
all
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
(voice
overlap)
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
and
they
can
run
it.
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
is
not
an
argument
appealing
to
judicial
notice.
it
is
an
argument
based
upon
the
terms
of
the
statute,
the
statute
by
its
language
and
by
its
intent
and
legislative
history
and
by
any
sense
of
what
a
reasonable
administration
of
such
a
law
would
be
necessarily
covers
every
place,
except
a
place
which
a
man
has
gone
to
some
trouble
to
so
structure
in
a
way
to
exclude
negroes.
and
that
would
be
possible
but
it
would
be
difficult.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh,
yes!
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh,
i
would
prefer
not
to
use
the
word
retroactive
mr.
justice
harlan,
it
can
be
phrased
in
that
way.
the
punishment,
if
it
is
to
occur
will
occur
in
the
future
the
entire
abatement
doctrine
of
united
states
against
chambers
and
suggested
by
mr.
justice
brennan
the
bell
case
really
says
that
the
courts
will
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
of
the
law
as
it
now
stands.
and
we
would
say
that
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
in
its
matter
of
statutory
interpretation,
the
common
law
of
federal
statutory
interpretation
and
in
a
certain
constitutional
dimension
removes
from
the
states
any
power
to
continue
with
these
proceedings.
i
will
argue
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
does.
what
i
had
intended
to
say
was
i
was
analogizing
in
--
on
that
part
of
my
argument,
this
case,
the
united
states
against
chambers.
and
the
chambers
case
was
a
case
in
which
the
passage
of
the
repeal
amendment
caused
the
abatement
of
prosecutions
that
were
perfectly
valid
under
a
statute
that
existed
at
the
time
that
those
prosecutions
were
commenced.
in
fact
the
statute
itself
i
don't
believe
was
repealed.
it
was
the
constitutional
amendment
that
removed
the
authority.
now,
our
argument
is
that
since
the
formation
of
this
republic,
the
congress
has
had
an
extremely
wide
authority
over
the
area
of
interstate
commerce,
and
well-phrased
in
various
ways
in
terms
of
congressional
intent
or
congressional
silence
or
in
terms
of
other
formulations,
states
have
exercised
power
over
such
commerce
and
activities
which
affect
such
commerce.
this
always
has
been
at
the
sufferance
of
the
congress.
when
the
congress
acted
at
this
time
to
take
this
matter
in
hand,
it
had
in
effect
of
constitutional
dimension
comparable
to
the
effect
of
the
repeal
of
the
prohibition
amendment.
and
we
make
the
same
argument
in
connection
with
the
implementation
of
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
the
congress
has
now
drawn
certain
lines.
it
has
made
certain
definitions
to
which
i
would
definitely
view
referred
in
your
opinion
in
the
bell
case
mr.
justice
black
as
one
of
the
reasons
why
you
thought
the
fourteenth
amendment
then
did
not
apply.
but
congress
has
now
made
certain
definitions
which
were
found
objectionable
and
--
of
the
lack
of
which
were
found
objectionable
in
that
opinion
and
so
now,
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
taken
hold
of
this
area.
and
these
are
two
expressions
of
congress
in
an
area
of
constitutional
competence
in
which
congress
can
completely
override
the
will
of
the
states.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
submit
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
here
too.
section
201
(d)
(2)
of
the
act
applies
to
state
action
and
it
defines
state
action
in
a
way
that
is
precisely
what
occurred
in
this
case.
if
i
may
read
it,
“state
action
is
--
refers
to
discrimination
or
segregation.
if
such
discrimination
or
segregation
is
carried
on
under
color
of
any
custom
or
usage
required
or
enforced
by
officials
of
the
state”.
now,
the
record
is
replete
here.
this
was
a
custom
of
segregation.
this
custom
of
segregation
was
being
enforced
by
officials
of
the
state,
they
were
arresting
the
man.
it
was
not
the
kind
of
state
action
for
example
that
is
--
of
which
might
call
of
more
elementary
sort
that
appears
in
section
202.
and
so
that
congress
has
spoken
to
that.
again
there's
some
legislative
history
on
this
point.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
that
it's
entirely
possible
that
the
statute
did
not
go
to
the
full
extent
of
the
section
5
powers,
but
nevertheless
the
statute
went
to
the
extent
covered
here.
the
statute
covers
costumer
usage
enforced
by
state
officials
and
i
would
say
that
is
by
arrest
and
conviction
in
this
case.
i
think
quite
possibly
while
congress
can
state
certain
minimums,
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
fact
very
well
might
go
beyond
this
and
this
court
has
declared
and
defined
the
fourteenth
amendment
frequently
without
particular
congressional
legislation.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
or
restaurants
which
come
under
the
state
action
criterion.
in
other
words,
i
imagine
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
might
have
a
perfectly
local
place
in
which
state
action
was
being
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
of
being
used
to
maintain
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
might've
been
a
peterson
or
a
lombard
type
situation
in
a
place
that
was
designed
and
structured
to
keep
negroes
out.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
but
the
statute
to
some
extent
is
declaratory
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
you
might
need
the
statute
--
you
might
need
the
statute,
it's
still
not
clear
as
to
get
an
injunction
to
be
served.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
no.
but
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
this
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
no,
not
in
the
case
of
criminal
defense
your
honor.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
think
i
take
a
different
position
mr.
justice
clark.
i
think
that
counsel
was
arguing
one
part
of
the
act
in
a
case
in
which
the
facts
were
set
out
by
a
complaint
in
which
the
united
states
was
a
defendant.
i
certainly
don't
think
the
united
states
has
argued
or
suggested
that
our
position
is
not
correct.
it
just
hasn't
addressed
itself
to
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
but
there
was
no
arrest
and
conviction
in
that
case.
in
my
case,
i
come
under
the
terms
of
the
statute.
we
don't
have
to
talk
about
the
fourteenth
amendment
at
this
point,
but
we
come
under
the
terms
of
the
statute
because
there
was
an
arrest
and
conviction
supporting
a
custom
of
segregation.
in
the
mcclung
case,
there
was
no
arrest
or
conviction.
he
just
filed
an
injunctive
suit
against
the
attorney
general.
but
i
would
assume
if
there
were
arrest
and
convictions
that
would
be
operative
here.
now,
i
might
say
that
there
is
legislative
history
on
this
point.
congressman
seller
said
--
seemed
to
indicate
in
a
congressional
record,
it's
not
in
our
brief,
on
page
1463
of
volume
110.
mr.
jack
greenberg
page
1463,
volume
110
of
the
daily
edition,
that
the
type
of
situation
i
described
here
would
be
covered.
senator
humphrey
on
the
other
hand
said
he
didn't
know.
this
was
--
this
--
he
said
this
type
of
situation
was
something
that
was
yet
before
the
courts
and
the
humphrey
statement
is
on
page
4684
of
the
same
volume,
but
he
didn't
say
it
wasn't
covered.
he
said
it
depended
upon
the
definition
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
i
would
submit
that
now
that
congress
has
addressed
itself
to
this
area,
the
definition
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
terms
of
types
of
places
covered,
and
types
of
state
action
limited
in
the
statute
makes
perhaps
a
different
result,
i
would
submit,
even
for
those
justices
who
thought
that
prior
to
the
act
there
might
not
have
been
any
cover.
mr.
jack
greenberg
volume
110.
mr.
jack
greenberg
they're
both
in
the
same
volume.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
seller
statement
is
in
1463,
those
are
both
in
the
daily
editions.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
think
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
as
i
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
think
that
congress
has
expanded
the
fourteenth
amendment.
at
least
as
i
understood
some
of
the
objections
to
fourteenth
amendment
coverage
as
such
in
some
of
the
cases
last
term
it
was
that
congress
had
not
with
precision
drawn
some
lines
as
the
types
of
establishment,
types
of
businesses,
types
of
professions,
size
of
establishments
and
so
forth.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
have
to
defer
to
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
well
--
but
my
understanding
and
i
would
submit
is
that
while
the
amendment
has
a
broad
and
perhaps
in
some
respects
inchoate
scope
that
that
scope
at
least
as
to
minimums
can
be
established
by
certain
definitions
of
the
congress.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
in
some
respects
that
it
--
in
other
words
it
is
not
effective
without
congressional
action.
at
least
it's
the
certain
places
where
there
have
been
no
definitions.
mr.
jack
greenberg
under
the
fifth
section.
mr.
jack
greenberg
addition,
i
would
like
at
the
outset
to
briefly
set
forth
the
sum
of
the
theories
on
which
he
relies
and
some
of
the
facts.
they
went
in
to
the
store
and
reverend
ivory
made
some
purchases
and
then
they
went
to
the
lunch
counter,
and
they
were
asked
by
the
manager
to
leave
the
lunch
counter.
one
of
our
arguments
which
i
don't
believe
i'll
have
time
to
present
orally
set
forth
at
length
in
our
brief
is
the
man
--
that
the
manager
never
did
asked
him
to
leave
the
premises.
the
warrant
speaks
in
terms
of
leaving
the
counter.
the
statute,
however
speaks
in
terms
of
leaving
the
premises.
i
think
this
is
an
important
point
because
they
were
welcome
on
the
premises.
they
bought
various
items
on
the
premises
and
they
were
later
told
they
could
go
to
a
checkout
counter
and
get
a
refund
for
the
matters
they
bought
on
the
premises.
however,
they
never
were
actually
asked
to
leave
the
premises
except
by
a
police
officer
later
on.
mr.
jack
greenberg
this
is
a
fair
warning
and
vagueness
argument,
yes.
much
--
something
like
the
decision
in
the
bouie
case,
and
our
--
we
have
an
argument
on
that
which
i
would
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
i
would
argue
that
as
well.
now
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
but
there
was
state
action
here
that
--
the
question
as
i
see
it
--
to
the
problems
is
was
that
the
kind
or
nature
of
state
action
which
comes
under
the
amendment.
well
which
--
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
there
was
state
action,
i
don't
think
anybody
can
or
would
deny
the
question
that
is
that
the
kind
of
state
action
or
the
degree
or
the
amount
of
state
action.
and
where
you
have
certain
definitions
as
i
understand
it
that
congress
can
do
something
which
the
courts
itself
--
courts
themselves
might
be
reluctant
to
do
in
terms
of
definition.
mr.
jack
greenberg
denial
of
the
kind
of
rights
that
you
have.
mr.
jack
greenberg
but
the
state
action
is
--
because
every
place
and
i
think
perhaps
with
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
congress
can
make
findings
and
review
evidence
and
obtain
information
that
the
court
sometimes
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
i
would
think
so.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
congress
did?
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
that
congress
did
--
yes,
that
congress
did,
yes.
congress
defined
types
of
establishment,
places
with
so
many
rooms,
people
live
in
them
or
they
don't.
it
talked
about
the
kind
of
state
action
that
didn't
talk
about
the
full
range
of
state
action.
they're
obviously
talking
about
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
there
was
nothing
said
about
trespass
statutes
one
way
or
the
other.
our
primary
argument
is
that
this
case
falls
within
the
--
by
virtue
of
the
passage
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
falls
within
the
rule
of
abatement
which
was
described
in
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
bell
against
maryland.
these
were
a
federal
conviction,
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
would
supplant
it,
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
could've
occurred
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
thompson
case
might
never
been
decided.
i'm
--
if
a
state
statute
had
been
passed
in
south
carolina
that
statute
would
supplant
the
state
conviction,
because
south
carolina
retains
the
ancient
rule
and
so
concedes
in
its
brief.
well,
we
argue
that
this
case
is
a
fortiori
that
federal
law
being
supreme
and
congress
having
exercised
power
and
authority
under
the
commerce
clause
and
the
fourteenth
amendment,
both
of
which
authorize
the
national
government
to
displace
state
authority.
the
federal
statute
is
to
be
read
as
abating
the
state
conviction
just
as
it
would
obliterate
a
state
conviction
on
these
facts
were
they
to
occur
tomorrow.
now,
section
203
(c)
of
the
act,
the
punishment
section
says
you
can't
convict
some
if
this
were
to
occur
today
or
tomorrow.
so
you
can't
convict
somebody
under
this
set
of
fact.
and
in
addition
to
the
plain
language,
senator
humphrey
was
quite
clear
on
the
statement
on
the
floor
that
appears
on
page
22
of
our
brief
that
you
can't
convict
somebody
for
trespass.
i
think
he
maybe
even
spoken
about
that
now
that
the
civil
rights
act
has
been
passed.
mr.
jack
greenberg
if
it
showed
genuine
disorder,
oh
yes.
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
yes,
it'd
be
a
question
of
fact.
mr.
jack
greenberg
and
would
be
like
the
garner
case
if
--
i
would
say
garner
could
not
be
--
the
civil
rights
act
would
save
garner.
but
if
he
were
actually
throwing
the
sugar
bowl
around
and
so
forth
it
wouldn't
save
him
now.
now
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh
no!
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
i'd
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
--
certainly
not.
i
hope
that
my
--
i
can
quite
clarify
that.
now
the
rule
of
abatement,
we
submit,
is
part
of
the
common
law
federal
statutory
interpretation,
but
it's
powerfully
reinforced
by
other
considerations.
the
rationale
behind
the
common
law
rule
was
stated
by
chief
justice
hues,
in
chambers
against
--
united
states
v.
chambers
when
he
referred
to
the
common
law
doctrine
as
standing
for
the
proposition
that
when
the
reason
for
the
rule
vanishes,
the
rule
must
go
as
well.
and
in
this
case,
we
submit,
that
he
reason
for
the
rule
has
been
undermined
with
the
most
emphatic
manner
imaginable.
not
only
has
what
once
was
a
crime
been
made
a
defense
to
a
charge
of
crime,
but
the
citizen's
right
to
demand
service
on
a
basis
of
equality
has
been
substituted
with
the
storeowners
asserted
right
to
discriminate.
moreover,
that
asserted
right
to
discriminate
rested
in
part
upon
certain
policy
considerations
which
now
have
little
or
no
weight.
one
justification
of
the
state's
power
to
arrest
then
convict
a
sit-in
demonstrator
in
the
face
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
been
that
the
negro
would-be
patron
has
not
demonstrated
that
he
is
entitled
to
service.
he
merely
sat
there
demanding
service
and
not
getting
it
in
the
kind
of
impasse.
but
that
impasse
no
longer
remains.
he's
entitled
to
service
now.
justification
has
also
been
offered
to
the
effect
that
proprietor
has
a
certain
expectancy
in
his
properties,
how
he
may
employ
it,
perhaps
some
degree
of
privacy
and
so
forth.
but
he
no
longer
can
refuse
service.
he
doesn't
have
that
expectancy
any
longer.
he
knows
he
has
to
serve.
another
justification
has
been
that
this
would
lead
to
affrays
and
the
use
of
self-help
and
so
forth,
but
it
would
be
now
totally
illegal
for
a
proprietor
to
do
self-help,
to
throw
a
negro
out
in
the
light
of
the
passage
of
the
civil
rights
act.
mr.
jack
greenberg
would
a
negro
be
able
to
use
self-help
to
get
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
confess
that
i
don't
know
what
the
law
on
that
is,
but
it
--
the
way
it
strikes
me
is
i
would
think
he
ought
not
to
be
able
to
that
he
reach
a
situation
that
as
if
i
come
home
to
my
house,
i
don't
know
that
if
somebody
is
standing
there
i
imagine
i
ought
to
go
and
get
a
policeman
or
do
something
to
get
into
it,
but
i
don't
know.
that's
not
involved
here
and
it
has
not
been
a
typical
situation.
mr.
jack
greenberg
so
exclusive,
yes.
well,
i
would
imagine
yes
of
course.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
he
would
have
to
resort
to
the
act.
so
the
reason
for
the
rule
on
which
the
judgments
of
conviction
rest
is
not
only
fallen
but
some
of
the
principle
policy
arguments
supporting
an
arrest
and
conviction
in
the
face
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
also
a
form.
but
more
than
that
as
it
worked
here.
i've
referred
to
the
common
law
of
abatement
but
everyone
recognizes
that
the
legislature
may
qualify,
this
with
a
savings
provision.
the
thrust
of
the
general
rule
however
is
that
the
burden
is
very
much
upon
the
legislature
to
make
such
savings
explicit.
and
in
criminal
cases,
the
further
thrust
of
our
jurisprudence
is
that
at
least
reasonable
doubts
will
be
resolved
in
favor
of
defendants.
the
argument
may
be
made
that
because
we
have
an
asserted
divestment
of
state
authority
by
federal
law,
the
delicacy
of
the
federal
state
relationship
council's
caution
in
reaching
the
conclusion
that
the
1964
act
restrains
the
continued
prosecution
of
those
whose
offenses
predate
the
act.
but
the
real
question
is
whether
following
enactment
of
the
1964
act,
any
state
constitutionally
retains
power
to
persist
in
regulating
through
continued
prosecution
and
punishment
the
behavior
which
had
been
taken
under
direct
federal
control
by
the
federal
act.
we
submit
the
federal
act
strip
the
states
of
such
power.
in
answer
to
questions
earlier,
i
stated
our
position
on
this
point,
and
that
is
that
the
action
of
the
congress
under
the
commerce
clause
with
respect
to
a
power
that
the
states
have
exercised
only
because
congress
over
the
years
has
permitted
them
either
by
intention
or
sovereign
or
otherwise
they
exercise
it,
is
now
such
a
paramount
exercise
of
federal
power
that
the
states
have
had
authority
taken
from
them
in
this
just
as
the
congress
had
authority
taken
from
it
by
the
passage
of
the
repeal
amendment.
now,
congress
could
have
narrowed
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
by
expressed
limitation
for
the
limited
purpose
of
letting
states
impose
punishment
in
cases
like
this.
it
could've
affected
such
a
limitation
just
s
chief
--
justice
hughes
pointed
out
in
the
chambers
case
it
could've
done
in
connection
with
the
prohibition
amendment,
but
congress
didn't
do
this.
it
may
be
that
congress'
failure
to
enact
the
savings
clause,
the
matter
occurred
to
anyone,
a
legislative
history
does
not
indicate
it
was
discussed.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
know,
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
imagine
that
to
the
extent
that
they
rested
upon
any
federal
authority
which
was
divested
by
the
passage
of
repeal
they
--
to
the
extent
they
rested
on
that,
they
would've
fallen
also,
but
i
don't
have
any
idea.
i'm
not
aware
that
there
are
such
cases.
mr.
jack
greenberg
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
quite
right
and
states
have
--
but
we
submit
there's
even
more
than
the
constitutional
consideration
than
the
--
what
we
call
the
common
law
federal
statutory
interpretation.
congress
has
enacted
a
savings
clause,
section
109
of
title
1,
and
what
that
savings
clause
deals
with,
and
it's
been
on
the
books
for
a
long
time
is
perhaps
quite
indicative
of
what
congress
did
not
intend
to
deal
with.
of
course
there've
been
cases
in
connection
with
109
over
the
years.
now,
section
109
which
is
the
federal
savings
clause
does
not
apply
to
this
case.
first
of
all
section
109
applies
only
to
state
--
or
i'm
sorry,
is
only
federal
statute,
does
not
apply
to
state
statute.
secondly,
section
109
deals
only
with
repeals,
and
in
the
chambers
case
and
in
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
bell
against
maryland
demonstrate
that
what
has
occurred
here
is
not
a
repeal
but
something
else,
something
which
may
be
characterized
as
substitution
of
a
right
for
a
crime.
finally,
section
109
allows
for
exceptions
even
for
those
statutes
which
have
been
repealed,
assuming
that
you
wanted
to
call
this
a
repealer.
and
section
203
(c)
would
be
such
an
exception
even
if
this
could
be
called
a
repeal
and
even
if
it
did
apply
to
state
judgments.
section
203
(c)
provides
that
no
person
shall
punish
any
person
for
exercising
any
right
or
privilege
secured
by
section
201
or
202.
and
we
have
an
argument
in
our
brief
that
is
--
there's
no
point
in
going
over
here,
but
they're
canvassing
the
various
dictionaries
and
so
forth
the
meaning
of
the
word
secure.
the
legislative
history
indicates
the
word
right
was
not
used
in
the
strictly
jural
sense,
even
though
they're
obviously
were
fourteenth
amendment
rights
covered
by
the
act
now
that
were
covered
earlier
so
--
but
it
was
used
in
some
certain
morals
and
since
that
legislative
history
is
set
forth
at
length
in
our
brief.
so
if
you
view
it,
109
is
applying
to
state
judgments
and
you
view
this
as
a
repeal,
section
203
is
an
explicit
exception.
but
we
think
section
203
(c)
has
even
more
force
than
that,
because
if
there's
going
to
be
a
punishment
there's
no
problem
of
retroactivity
that
punishment
is
going
to
occur
in
the
future.
and
section
203
(c),
even
if
we
fall
into
the
use
of
the
words
perspective
and
retroactive,
is
applying
to
something
that's
going
to
happen
prospectively.
it
says
no
one
shall
be
punished
for
exercising
rights.
these
rights
sometimes
are
legal,
sometimes
are
moral,
even
predating
the
act.
and
we
would
submit
that
203
(c)
would
cover
the
situation.
now,
even
if
our
argument
that
the
federal
act
wipes
this
all
out
doesn't
apply,
the
federal
statute
is
the
law
of
south
carolina
just
as
any
federal
treaty
is
the
law
of
the
state,
constitution
as
the
law
of
the
state.
cases
of
this
court
(inaudible)
hallenstein
v.
lyman
(ph),
and
other
cases
have
made
this
abundantly
clear.
the
law
of
south
carolina,
we've
argued
and
this
conceded
in
the
brief
for
the
state
of
south
carolina
is
that
if
this
were
south
carolina
public
accommodation
statute,
it
would
have
to
abate
under
south
carolina
law.
except
that
south
carolina
has
an
argument
that,
i
trust
this
court
will
not
accept,
and
that
is
that
even
were
this
incident
to
occur
today
these
petitioners
could
be
prosecuted
for
trespass.
south
carolina
argues
that
if
they're
told
they
can't
be
served,
they
have
to
go
out
and
file
an
action
for
an
injunction,
if
they
don't,
they're
trespassers.
well,
i
think
that
was
made
quite
clear
in
the
boynton
case
and
peterson
and
lombard
case
that
someone
who
is
sitting
there
demanding
service
against
a
situation
where
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
being
violated
is
not
a
trespasser.
it
can't
be
convicted
for
trespass,
legislative
history
can
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
but
south
car
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right,
but
south
carolina
is
arguing
here
is
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
but
south
carolina
argues
here
that
they're
trespasser
under
--
even
under
those
situations.
i
was
merely
saying
that
i
trust
that
argument
won't
be
given
any
weight.
mr.
jack
greenberg
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
but
we
do
make
that
argument
in
our
brief
we
made
it
last
year,
but
i
think
the
court
is
quite
familiar
with
it.
there's
been
abundance
of
opinions
on
the
point
and
while
we
urge
it
strongly,
we
don't
depend
on
that
argument.
but
nevertheless
we
feel
that
this
argument
so
clearly
covers
it,
that
we
don't
have
to
go
through
all
that
again.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
this
is
the
law
of
the
state
of
south
carolina.
they
have
the
ancient
common
law
rule.
they've
got
a
number
of
cases
on
it.
they
admit
it
in
their
brief.
their
defense
seems
to
be
that
if
this
situation
occurred
today
the
negro
would
be
guilty
of
trespass.
we
submit
that's
clearly
not
the
language.
the
intent
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
that
he
wouldn't
be
and
consequently
under
the
south
carolina
jurisprudence,
the
conviction
must
abate
and
if
south
carolina
refuses
to
follow
the
federal
law
in
the
case,
we
would
follow
at
state
law,
this
is
a
discrimination
against
the
federal
law
and
there
are
cases
which
indicate
that
that
judgment
would
have
to
fall.
mr.
jack
greenberg
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
feel
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
like
to
say,
first
of
all,
of
course
it
could
and
there
could
be
done
a
variety
of
ways
probably
by
hearing
on
this
very
question.
but
i
would
urge
most
strongly
that
that
not
be
done,
because
if
a
negro
traveler
is
to
get
off
the
train
in
saint
louis
and
have
an
hour
between
trains
and
then
have
to
go
into
town
and
wonder
whether
or
not
what
is
going
on
inside
the
mind
of
the
proprietor
in
the
drugstore,
the
act
will
become
completely
inadministrable.
if
somebody
wants
to
affirmatively
keep
negroes
out
off
his
restaurant,
the
act
gives
him
a
way
to
do
it
if
he
wants
to
go
to
a
sufficient
amount
of
trouble
to
do
it.
but
a
place
which
offers
to
serve
and
that
there
is
no
substantiality
requirement,
when
congress
meant
substantiality
it
said
it
in
the
third
category,
substantial
amount
of
food.
there
was
a
substantiality
amendment
and
it
was
rejected,
it
was
proffered
and
then
it
was
rejected
that
a
place
which
affirmatively,
especially
a
large
national
chain
like
mccrory's
but
any
place
which
offers
to
serve
the
public
affirmatively.
there's
no
negative
--
that's
not
--
nothing
negative,
the
public
includes
lesser
categories
of
the
public
and
in
this
nation
with
all
the
travel
that
we
have
and
all
the
moving
around
it
covers
everybody.
congressman
seller,
a
number
of
times,
in
rejecting
the
substantiality
amendment
said
that
if
this
were
accepted
we
wouldn't
cover
all
stores.
because
its
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
in
the
stores
and
lunch
counters
and,
yes
its
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
restaurants
are
covered,
but
the
store
is
covered
if
the
restaurant
is
in
the
store.
we
--
as
if
from
the
boynton
case,
if
the
act
were
interpreted
as
had
been
urged
by
the
state
of
virginia,
then
before
a
negro
could
get
a
sandwich
he
would
have
to
investigate
the
inter-corporate
relations
between
the
lunch
counter
and
the
bus
terminal
and
the
carrier.
the
opinion
interpreted
the
act
in
the
way
that
--
it
was
quite
clearly
the
intent
of
the
act,
but
made
that
completely
unnecessary.
you
wouldn't
--
you'd
--
to
getting
people
convicted
of
trespass
and
i've
been
in
the
case
in
which
this
was
done
in
order
to
make
a
complete
record
and
it's
like
an
antitrust
case.
you
got
to
go
in
to
the
guy's
records
and
invoices
and
call
in
suppliers
and
everything
else,
and
i
don't
think
it's
called
for
but
for
the
act
and
enforcement
would
completely
breakdown
anytime,
somebody
really
wanted
to
resist
the
act.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
won't
say
it
establishes
a
presumption
but
if
a
place
is
--
offers
to
serve
the
public,
it
offers
to
serve
all
members
of
the
public
and
that
includes
persons
who
travel
from
one
state
to
another.
now,
a
man
could
set
up
a
restaurant
saying
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it's
a
logical
inference
that
the
lesser
is
included
within
the
greater.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
he
did
not
offer
to
serve
interstate
travelers?
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
don't
think
he
could
come
in
and
show
that
if
it
were
not
--
that
if
in
fact
he
were
offering
to
serve
the
whole
public
i
don't
think
he
could
come
in
and
show
that
he
was
not
offering
to
serve
the
whole
public
now.
i
mean,
he
could
try
to
show
it
but
it
would
be
negative
by
the
fact
that
he
was
offering
to
serve
the
whole
public.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
can
only
repeat
what
i
said
that,
offers
to
serve
the
public
means
offer
to
serve
the
whole
public.
now,
when
he
was
questioned
on
various
categories
of
the
public
in
connection
with
racial,
national
and
political
beliefs,
he
said
“well,
yes,
i
serve
everybody”.
this
is
everybody
and
i
submit
that
if
a
negro
in
clarksdale,
mississippi
has
to
conduct
a
pretrial
discovery
of
a
restaurant
to
discover
whether
or
not
they
are
offering
to
serve
interstate
travelers
and
to
whether
or
not
a
substantial
amount
of
the
food
moves
in
commerce
and
so
forth,
this
is
a
very
formidable
weapon
that
is
not
consistent
with
the
intent
of
the
act
or
the
language
of
the
act,
the
purpose
of
the
act
and
so
forth.
now
i
thought,
what
would
i
do
if
i
wanted
to
counsel
a
man,
how
to
set
up
a
restaurant
in
which
he
could
keep
negroes
out,
and
its
possible.
he
could
put
up
a
sign
saying
“intrastate
travelers
only”,
and
then
of
course
under
the
actual
served
provision
he
would
have
to
check
on
the
people
who
came
in
to
find
he
didn't
actually
serve
them,
because
you
have
both.
you
have
offered
to
serve
and
serve
and
then
he'd
have
a
very
peculiar
kind
of
diet
there
made
of
just
of
locals
food
and
he
couldn't
have
coffee
or
tea
or
salt
or
probably
sugar
and
so
forth.
and
then
of
course
there'd
be
other
state
action
problems
but
it
--
for
someone
who
is
genuinely
eccentric
and
wants
to
do
it
and
there
are
food
faddists
who
do
that
kind
of
thing
and
other
connections,
it
can
be
done.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right,
he'd
have
to
--
he'd
have
a
lot
of
--
a
lot
of
problems
but
he
might
be
able
to
do
it.
but
that
is
not
this
case,
and
anyway
this
is
mccrory's,
a
huge
chain,
but
i'd
say
it
would
apply
to
any
place.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
i
think
the
act
contemplates
that,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
was
arrest
and
conviction
to
enforce
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
what
is
amply
described
in
the
record
as
a
costumer
segregation,
yes.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
mr.
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
think
so,
because
definitely
this
doesn't
affect
any
--
doesn't
inflict
the
punishment
and
doesn't
affect
any
vested
private
rights
and
i
would
think
it
could
be
done.
in
fact
it
has
--
this
is
what
the
abatement
doctrine
does
either
by
legislative
implication
or
common
law
in
hundreds
of
cases.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
don't
know
of
any
cases
but
i
don't
know
why
the
commerce
power
can't
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
doesn't,
perhaps
it
should.
but
i
don't
think
it
does
because
no
rights
are
being
divested.
all
congress
is
doing
is
stopping
a
state
in
carrying
out
a
public
policy
which
congress
finds
obnoxious
to
national
policy
under
certain
powers.
but
no
one
is
being
damaged
by
it,
in
fact
in
louisville
&
nashville
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh
yes!
louisville
&
nashville
--
nashville
railroad
versus
mottley
which
the
case
cited
in
our
brief,
the
mottley's,
as
a
result
of
an
injury
on
the
railroad,
settled
a
claim
with
the
railroad
and
received
a
lifetime
pass.
then
congress
passed
a
statute
saying
that
such
lifetime
passes
could
not
be
given
out
under
any
circumstances,
and
the
mottley
is
prosecuted
a
claim
first
in
the
federal
court
and
it
was
a
question
of
jurisdiction
and
the
state
court,
and
they
got
a
judgment
and
this
court
reversed
it.
and
there
was
a
vested
personal
claim
being
retroactively
taken
away
under
the
commerce
power.
so
the
power
of
the
congress
to
do
this
is
i
submit
quite
clear.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh
yes,
that's
true.
that's
true.
but
the
commerce
power
goes
to
--
i
believe
one
of
the
opinions
of
this
court
say
in
an
antitrust
case
anything
that's
more
than
de
minimis.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
that
argument
has
occurred
--
that
argument
has
occurred
to
me
and
i
think
it's
entirely
possible.
i
didn't
argue
it.
i
feared
that
it
might
sound
as
if
--
well,
but
i
didn't
mean
to
argue
that
it
--
that
if
this
claim
is
rejected,
there
is
going
to
be
some
terrible
national
turmoil
and
this
should
be
a
consideration
why
the
court
should
do
something
of
that
sort.
i
don't
--
i
think
that
in
some
places
there
might
be
a
reaction
to
it,
but
i
would
hesitate
to
argue
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
prefer
to
stay
away
from
the
use
of
the
word
intent
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
unless
by
intent
you
mean
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
---
the
type
of
conclusions
courts
come
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
if
congress
had
--
in
other
words
if
this
came
within
let's
say
109
or
congress
had
a
savings
clause
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
argue
then
under
my
seconds
--
the
second
part
of
my
brief
which
is
the
fourteenth
amendment
section
that
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh
no,
if
congress
had
an
enacted
a
savings
clause,
then
we
would
have
a
different
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
absolutely
correct
in
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
think
that's
inconsistent
with
my
answer
to
justice
black.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
in
what
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh
no!
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
have
not
argued
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
think
i
have
to
argue
that.
mr.
jack
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
jack
greenberg
this
matter
of
leaving
the
store
and
leaving
the
premises
i
think
is
very
easily
resolved
by
looking
at
the
warrant.
what
happened
is
the
manager
asked
them
to
leave
the
counter.
any
demand
to
leave
the
store
was
made
by
the
police
officer
or
at
the
direction
of
the
police
officer,
that's
what
the
warrant
says.
and
the
warrant
is
born
out
by
the
testimony.
the
warrant
says,
on
page
2
now,
which
is
the
warrant,
“by
remaining
along
with
reverend
ivory
at
the
lunch
counter
which
is
customarily
operated
on
a
segregated
basis
and
refusing
to
leave
the
said
counter,
after
the
manager
of
said
store,
in
the
presence
of
city
police
captain
john
m.
hunsaker
advised
him
he
would
not
be
served
and
specifically
requested
him
to
leave
said
lunch
counter.
and
after
the
aforesaid
police
officer
thereupon
advised
him
that
he
would
be
arrested
for
trespass
unless
he
left
the
said
premises
as
directed”.
at
page
78
of
the
record
to
which
the
attorney
general
adverted
refers
to
a
request
being
made
at
the
instigation
of
the
police
officer.
so
the
premises
store
conflict
falls
neatly
in
the
place,
in
fact
everything
in
the
record
is
consistent
with
the
warrant,
and
there's
nothing
inconsistent.
mr.
jack
greenberg
this
was
june
1960,
the
sit-ins
began
around
february.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
in
this
case?
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh
(inaudible)this
lunch
counter
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
these
--
the
earliest
ones
were
at
lunch
counters
in
a
larger
establishment
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
and
then
some
of
them
like
cooper's
restaurant
and
(inaudible)
restaurant.
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
to
this
case?
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
i
would
say
that
--
if
the
storeowner
said,
“would
you
please
move
away
from
that
counter?”
and
then
he
--
the
man
didn't,
then
the
storeowner
would
--
ought
to
say,
“well,
then
please
leave
the
store”,
then
the
statute
would
apply.
but
if
then
he
were
prosecuted
under
a
statute
which
said
leave
the
premises
and
not
part
of
the
premises.
in
some
states,
they
drafted
statutes,
you
can
draft
the
statute
like
that
if
you
want
to.
mr.
jack
greenberg
then
it
wouldn't
apply.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
i
would
say
that
would
not
give
a
fair
warning
in
--
according
to
the
ordinary
assumptions
that
we
make
about
how
businesses
are
conducted,
certainly.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
would
say
it
would
not
get
fair,
it's
another
way
of
saying,
would
not
give
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
and
the
only
reason
anybody
said,
“well,
we
all
know
what
this
means
--
”
is
because
there
was
a
negro
receiving
service
at
the
lunch
counter,
but
that
of
course
really
points
up
what
the
vice
of
this
entire
proceedings
was.
i
mean
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
the
only
reason
it
was
construed
that
way
i
think
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
was
not
raised
in
precisely
this
form
however
its
implicit
that
--
there
was
a
lot
of
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
there
was
claim
of
vagueness
in
connection
with
the
multiplicity
and
just
the
open-end
quality
of
the
statutes
that
were
used
in
the
trial
court,
when
the
prosecutor
was
asked
under
what
provision
is
this
being
brought.
he
said
under
all
the
available
law
and
then
he
had
to
specify
even
in
section
386,
and
then
he
referred
to
a
ordinance
of
the
city
of
rock
hill,
and
then
he
referred
to
section
388
which
is
the
new
statute.
386
incidentally
was
held
unconstitutional
by
this
court
last
year.
and
then
the
charge
of
the
jury
talked
about
civil
trespass
and
breach
of
the
peace,
and
then
the
intermediate
appellate
court
affirmed
on
the
ground
of
the
old
statute
and
the
state's
supreme
court
affirmed
on
the
ground
of
the
new
statute.
and
i
think
there's
a
sufficient
allegations
and
claims
about
due
process
vagueness
and
fair
warning
in
the
case
to
encompass
this
article
--
this
argument,
though
this
argument
was
not
in
terms
made.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
yes,
it
--
but
it
--
i
don't
claim
it
was
made
in
exactly
this
way,
but
i
think
the
entire
issue
of
specificity
was
before
the
state
court
in
some
form.
may
it
please
the
court,
the
argument
concerning
abatement
which
we
have
just
presented
in
its
constitutional
statutory
and
common
law
dimensions
is
one
that
applies
with
singularly
--
singular
appropriateness,
we
submit,
to
the
cases
at
bar.
well,
these
petitioners,
we
submit,
are
not
merely
the
beneficiaries
of
an
overwhelming
legislative
declaration
that
expresses
the
conscience
of
the
nation.
but
they
along
with
thousands
of
others
in
the
same
situation
are
the
ones
who
without
regard
to
personal
security
risked
their
liberty
to
arouse
the
conscience
of
the
nation
that
led
to
the
passage
of
the
very
act
which
we
claim
here
protects
them.
the
doctrine
of
abatement
at
each
of
the
levels
that
we
offered
here
is
an
ordinary
expression
of
our
law
as
it
has
existed
even
before
this
nation
was
republic.
it
is
still,
except
with
a
legislature,
has
expressly
gone
on
record
to
the
country
recognized
as
well
settled.
in
fact,
were
these
defendants
to
be
punished
while
others
today
would
not
be
punished,
it
would
raise
questions
like
those
in
the
opinion
of
three
of
the
justices
of
this
court
in
the
rice
versus
sioux
city
cemetery
case,
i'd
like
to
read
a
couple
of
sentences
from
that.
the
court
dismisses
this
case
because
the
iowa
legislature
has
provided
that
every
person
in
iowa
except
one
who
has
already
filed
a
suit
can
prosecute
claims
like
this.
apparently
this
law
leaves
everyone
in
iowa
free
to
vindicate
this
kind
of
right
except
the
petitioner.
this
raises
a
new
question
of
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
equally
as
grave
as
those
which
prompted
us
to
take
this
case
originally.
we
cannot
agree
that
this
dismissal
is
justified
merely
because
this
petitioner
is
the
only
one
whose
rights
may
have
been
unconstitutionally
denied.
it
would
be
indeed
a
bitter
departure
from
the
spirit
of
our
jurisprudence
if
these
petitioners,
perhaps
uniquely
situated,
as
those
whose
actions
brought
about
the
legal
change
in
which
we
rely
were
punished
because
they
had
the
courage
and
inspiration
to
awaken
the
conscience
of
this
nation.
we
respectfully
submit
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean
by
a
constitutional
argument.
i
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
i'm
arguing
why
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh
no.
no.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
but
i
would
say
that
under
these
circumstances
that
i
would
hope
that
this
court
would
be
slow
to
conclude
that
congress
intended
such
a
result
to
come
about.
we
refer
of
course
to
--
we
come
back
to,
if
i
may
use
the
word,
the
intention
of
congress
in
this
act,
and
we
think
that
the
court
in
construing
the
act
must
come
to
some
conclusion
concerning
what
it
was
congress
wanted
to
do
with
the
act.
well,
we
submit,
we
hope
that
this
court
will
not
likely
conclude
that
congress
abandoned
so
settled
an
ordinary
doctrine
as
the
abatement
principle
to
inflict
so
striking
an
extraordinary
punishment
in
this
case.
that's
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
--
thrust
of
this
argument.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i'm
not
aware
of
that.
