ms.
constance
baker
motley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioners
are
here
as
in
the
preceding
case
pursuant
to
the
granting
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
by
this
court
to
review
a
state
court
judgment
of
conviction
for
criminal
trespass
growing
out
of
a
sit-in
demonstration.
these
petitioners
asserted
below
and
assert
here
that
their
convictions
violate
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution.
as
in
the
previous
case
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes
sir.
our
brief
is
the
same
as
in
the
preceding
case.
one
brief
was
filed
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
as
in
the
preceding
case,
since
the
filing
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
on
this
case
on
september
3,
1963
and
the
granting
of
that
petition
by
this
court
on
june
22nd
of
this
year,
the
national
congress
has
enacted
title
ii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
that
title
now,
secures
the
petitioners
and
all
other
negroes
similarly
situated
the
right
to
equal
treatment
in
privately
owned
places
of
public
accommodation
which
served
the
public
if
the
operations
of
such
places
affect
commerce.
that
title
also
makes
it
unlawful
for
any
person
to
deny
equal
treatment
in
such
establishments.
moreover,
the
public
accommodations
title
specifically
prohibit
punishment
for
exercising
or
attempting
to
exercise
the
right
to
equal
treatment
in
such
covered
establishments.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
i
think
there
is
indication
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
that
many
members
of
the
congress
view
this
right
as
existing
at
least
on
moral
ground
than
what
they
were
tending
to
do
by
this
act
was
to
secure
it
from
denial
by
individuals
and
by
the
state.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
what
happened
on
there
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
the
security
of
the
right,
if
i
can
put
it
that
way,
i
--
as
i
say
i
think
that
there
was
some
notion
in
the
congress
that
these
rights
were
existing
but
not
specifically
secured
by
national
legislation
and
they
were
attempting
by
this
act
to
put
protections
in
the
form
of
the
federal
statute
around
these
rights
which
they
assume
that
every
citizen
had
or
people
in
the
nation
assumed
without
anyone
having
previously
said
so.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
pardon
me
--
if?
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
that's
right
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
the
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
one
congressman
even
said
that
people
have
argued
this
is
already
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
so
--
in
the
senate,
i
understand,
this
was
specifically
taken
up
and
that
appears
on
page
31
of
our
brief.
in
the
senate,
there
was
this
change
made
from
the
words
hereby
created
was
changed
to
base
on
this
title
which
would
seem
to
indicate
that
there
was
some
real
notion
that
here
we
have
rights
which
were
preexisting
which
were
being
protected.
now,
specifically
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
the
--
if
i
can
handle
the
question,
these
defendants
were
exercising
a
right
now
secured
by
this
act.
and
203
now
prohibits
the
infliction
of
the
punishment
which
is
not
yet
been
inflicted,
that
is
the
prison
term
and
the
$500
fine.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
i
would
say
so.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
like
the
preceding
case,
these
petitioners
also
contend
that
title
ii
mandates
a
reversal
of
the
judgments
below
and
the
remanding
of
these
cases
for
dismissal
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
pursuant
to
the
unique
legislative
phenomenon
rule
annunciated
by
this
court
in
bell
against
maryland
and
in
accordance
with
the
expressed
terms
of
section
203
(c)
of
title
ii
which
we
have
just
referred
to
permitting
punishment
for
exercising
the
right
to
equal
treatment
in
places
of
public
accommodation.
the
argument
just
made
by
mr.
greenberg
of
course
in
the
preceding
case
with
respect
to
this
we
adopt.
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
arkansas
like
maryland
and
unlike
south
carolina
does
have
a
saving
clause
statute.
in
fact
they
have
two
which
relate
to
this
problem
and
these
statutes
appear
on
pages
6
and
7
of
our
brief.
unlike
maryland
however,
these
arkansas
statutes
refer
only
to
repeal
of
any
criminal
or
penal
statute.
consequently,
if
this
court
for
some
reason
should
not
agree
with
the
petitioner's
argument
that
title
ii
has
the
effect
of
compelling
a
reversal
of
these
convictions
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
and
a
remand
of
these
cases
for
dismissal,
then
these
cases
may
be
subject
to
the
same
disposition
made
by
this
court
in
bell
against
maryland
that
is
a
remand
to
the
highest
court
of
the
state
for
consideration
of
the
effect
of
the
enactment
of
title
ii
on
these
convictions
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
it
may
very
well,
be
as
this
court
held
in
bell
against
maryland
that
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas,
whose
judgment
this
court
is
now
asked
to
review,
might
hold
the
enactment
of
title
ii
substituting
a
crime,
a
right
rather
for
a
crime
and
vice
versa
is
a
unique
legislative
phenomenon
in
that
state.
and
consequently,
these
convictions
are
outside
of
arkansas'
general
saving
clause
statutes
which
relate
only
to
repeal
of
criminal
statutes,
thus
leaving
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
to
hold
applicable
to
these
cases
the
common
law
rule
requiring
dismissal
of
a
pending
criminal
proceeding
whenthe
legislature
removes
the
state's
condemnation
from
conduct
that
was
formerly
being
criminal.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
yes,
they
would
be
then
saying
here
is
the
civil
rights
act
which
is
a
part
of
the
law
of
the
state
like
any
other
federal
statute
which
we
now
have
to
construe
and
find
out
what
effect
this
new
state
law
has
on
these
pending
convictions.
respondents
concede
that
title
ii
like
any
other
federal
statute
as
a
part
of
the
law
of
the
state
of
arkansas.
as
a
part
of
the
state
of
arkansas,
as
i've
indicated,
title
ii
not
only
removes
arkansas'
condemnation
of
petitioner's
conduct
which
was
peacefully
seeking
food
service
in
a
department
store
and
refusing
to
leave
the
lunch
counter
when
ordered
to
do
so
by
the
owner.
but
it
precludes
arkansas
from
now
imposing
upon
petitioners
lupper
and
robinson
of
$500
fine
and
a
30
day
prison
term,
that's
what
these
petitioners'
fate
in
this
case.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes
they
might
with
states
--
the
different
states
might,
but
of
course
if
this
court
should
hold
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
that
these
prosecutions
abate,
don't
you
see
we
would
then
have
a
precedent
which
the
state
courts
would
then
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no.
i
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
if
the
different
courts
would
interpret
it
differently,
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
if
as
respondents'
claim,
arkansas
has
to
further
expand
on
this
point.
if
these
respondents
claim
arkansas
has
now
set
its
face
against
its
officially
segregated
path
and
has
now
turned
for
the
future,
free
from
state
imposed
or
sanctioned
racial
segregation
in
the
public
life
of
that
state
then
certainly
this
new
state
policy
might
be
taken
into
consideration
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
upon
a
remand
of
these
cases
to
that
court
to
determine
the
effect
of
title
ii
on
these
convictions.
but
as
mr.
greenberg
has
already
argued,
this
remand
for
state
court
consideration
of
the
effect
of
title
ii
is
entirely
unnecessary
and
there
is
ample
federal
authority
and
necessitate
for
remand
for
dismissal
by
this
court.
petitioners
here
argue,
as
did
petitioners
in
bell
against
maryland
that
their
convictions
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
since
their
convictions
enforced
racial
discrimination
in
violation
of
that
clause.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
if
i
might
just
for
a
moment
summarize
our
position
with
respect
to
the
abatement
of
these
convictions
before
proceeding
so
that
it
would
be
clear
to
the
court
exactly
what
our
position
is.
we
say
first,
if
this
court
determines
that
enactment
of
the
civil
rights
act
results
in
abatement
of
state
prosecutions
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
then
these
convictions
must
be
reversed
and
remanded
for
dismissal.
we
say
secondly
that
if
this
court
in
interpreting
section
203
(c)
determines
that
the
states
cannot
carry
out
punishment
even
though
the
act
of
sitting
in
took
place
prior
to
adoption
of
the
civil
rights
act
then
these
convictions
must
also
be
reversed
here
and
remanded
for
dismissal
below.
now,
our
third
position
is
that
if
this
court
determines
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
that
there
is
no
mandatory
abatement
of
state
criminal
proceedings,
then
the
cases
would
have
to
be
remanded
with
instructions
for
the
state
court
to
determine
the
effect
of
its
law
of
abatement
in
these
circumstances.
now,
mr.
greenberg
has
already
pointed
out,
south
carolina
does
not
have
a
saving
clause
and
therefore
the
civil
rights
act
in
that
state
interpret
it
as
a
part
of
the
law
of
that
state,
these
decisions
would
abate
because
the
common
law
would
be
applicable
and
the
state
--
on
the
state
law
they
would
abate
and
the
state
of
south
carolina
could
not
discriminate
against
a
federal
law.
in
arkansas
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
a
saving
statute
and
therefore
it's
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
if
repeal
means
the
same
thing
as
repeal
in
the
federal
statute
then
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
might
hold
that
these
convictions
abate
because
there
is
no
statute
saving
the
punishment.
if
not,
then
the
proceedings
do
not
abate
and
of
course
that
would
be
a
question
of
state
law
and
the
law
of
the
state,
they
would
not
abate
and
then
we
could
not
come
back
here
on
that
question.
although
of
course
we
have
other
questions,
constitutional
questions,
equal
protection
and
so
forth
which
we
argued.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
in
this
case,
as
in
the
preceding
case
the
record
is
clear
that
this
was
a
department
store.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
pardon
me?
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right,
it
doesn't
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
it
does
not.
it
appears
to
be
locally
owned.
there's
no
testimony
on
that
question.
but
it
is
a
department
store
and
one
of
the
petitioners
testified
that
he
had
been
a
costumer
there
for
some
time
and
that
his
mother
had
an
account
there
for
19
or
20
years.
it
was
therefore
a
place
open
to
the
public.
and
our
position
is
that
open
to
the
public
includes
all
of
the
public
and
is
therefore
covered
by
the
civil
rights
act
because
it
is
a
place
which
serves
the
public.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
it
appears
that
these
petitioners
went
to
the
lunch
counter
and
they
were
approached
by
the
manager
and
the
assistant
manager.
the
manager,
he
merely
says
he
--
he
told
them
he
didn't
want
any
disturbance
and
they'd
have
to
leave.
then
the
assistant
manager
testified
that
he
approached
some
boys
in
the
lunch
counter
and
spoke
to
one,
not
one
of
these
petitioners
but
one
in
the
group
and
said,
“well,
we're
just
not
prepared
to
serve
you
now,
would
you
excuse
yourself?”
meaning
move
away
from
the
counter.
the
manager
went
outside
of
the
store
and
got
the
police
officers
and
came
back.
the
police
officers
had
already
been
called
by
another
police
officer,
who
had
observed
these
issues
going
into
the
store
and
observed
them
sitting
themselves
at
the
counter
and
ran
out
and
called
the
police
headquarters
and
apparently
was
not
too
far
away,
that's
when
the
manager
went
out
there
were
the
two
police
who
was
across
the
street.
the
manager
came
back
in
with
the
two
police
officers
and
there
were
the
petitioners
walking
out
for
the
front
door.
the
police
officer
said,
“are
you
the
two
men”
and/or
the
manager
identified
them
as
being
among
the
five
which
he
saw
at
the
lunch
counter
and
that
was
when
they
were
arrested.
now
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
there
is
no
direct
testimony
as
to
how
much
time
actually
elapsed.
but
it
does
appear
that
it
was
just
a
few
minutes,
two
to
five
minutes,
i
believe
the
manager
testified
that
they
took
him
to
go
over
and
to
come
back
into
the
store.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
that's
right.
from
the
time
they
came
into
the
store
initially
when
they
--
on
their
way
up
at
some
time
the
whole
business
took
place
some
time
between
11:30
and
--
well,
no
one
knows
the
exact
time
but
the
going
out
and
getting
the
police
was
apparently
just
a
couple
of
minutes.
now,
before
--
i
would
--
i'll
come
back
to
those
facts
when
i
get
to
my
due
process
argument
but
i
did
want
to
say
a
word
about
equal
protection
argument.
we
argue
here
as
petitioners
in
bell
and
the
other
cases
decided
last
term
that
these
convictions
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
since
these
convictions
enforce
racial
discrimination
in
violation
of
that
clause.
the
same
constitutionally
relevant
reasons
which
we
urge
so
extensively
and
exhaustively
in
bell
for
reaching
this
conclusion
have
been
succinctly
repeated
in
our
brief
here
at
pages
46
to
69.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes
and
our
custom
argument
and
our
regime
of
law
argument.
these
arguments
were
made
so
very
recently
for
this
court
last
term
and
the
court's
decision
in
bell
evidences
that
this
court
is
thoroughly
familiar
with
our
contentions
in
this
regard
that
we
would
like
to
not
argue
that
really
extensively
here
today.
however,
i
think
it
should
be
noted
again
that
since
the
granting
of
certiorari
in
these
cases
and
this
court's
decision
in
bell,
we
now
have
a
federal
legislative
prohibition
against
enforcement
of
the
custom
of
segregation
by
the
states
which
we
did
not
have
before
when
this
court
considered
the
bell
conviction.
so
that
here
we
have
a
federal
statute
which
seems
designed
to
cover
exactly
what
occurred
in
these
cases.
the
court
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
and
take
--
yes,
it
takes
up
custom,
the
enforcement
of
custom
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
don't
think
he
meant
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
to
exclude.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
don't
think
there
is
a
case
specifically
on
custom.
i
think
what
he
meant
to
say,
he
took
up
the
greenville
situation
where
we
had
an
ordinance.
they
took
up
the
lombard
situation
where
you
had
an
official
declaration,
but
i
don't
know
of
any
prior
supreme
court
decision
dealing
with
state
court
enforcement
of
custom.
so
that
--
because
they
had
been
argued
here
on
prior
occasions,
i
feel
that
this
is
why
custom
is
included
because
as
the
--
a
manager
testified
the
south
carolina
case
there
was
no
law,
what
he
was
enforcing
was
the
custom
of
the
community,
not
to
serve
negroes.
and
therefore,
the
state
through
these
convictions
and
prosecutions
and
imposition
of
punishment
we
say
the
state
is
enforcing
the
custom
of
segregation.
it's
like
the
situation
in
shelley
against
kraemer.
we
had
a
specific
federal
statute
there,
on
the
right
to
acquire,
lease,
and
hold
real
property
without
regard
to
race
and
color.
now,
we
have
a
federal
statute
which
says
specifically
that
the
courts
may
not
enforce
the
custom
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
of
segregation.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
that
which
is
generally
pursued
in
the
community,
here
we
don't
really
have
that
problem
because
the
custom
was
identified
in
the
south
carolina
case
and
explicitly
recognized
as
the
custom
of
the
community.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
according
to
the
record
in
this
case,
it
appeared
this
was
universal
in
that
particular
city
of
rock
hill.
but
certainly
it
wouldn't
have
to
be
a
substantial
majority
of
the
community
following
a
particular
custom
of
excluding
negroes,
i
would
think,
to
say
that
we
have
in
this
community
a
custom
of
discriminating
against
negroes
and
certainly
in
every
southern
state
where
the
state
as
a
matter
of
state
policy
has
had
state
laws
requiring
segregation
in
various
areas.
all
such
states
i
would
say
have
a
custom
generally
in
the
community
of
segregation
solely
from
that
as
a
matter
of
fact.
i
think
that
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
i
think
you'd
have
to
show
some
state
connection
with
that
as
in
these
cases
that
--
as
easily
showed
the
state
connection
as
demonstrated
by
the
state
statutes,
the
massive
state
statutes
on
segregation
which
supports
that
custom
if
we're
going
to
rely
on
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
i
think
that's
this
part
of
the
civil
rights
statute
was
passed
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
mind
they
had
in
mind
state
custom
stemming
from
and
nourished
by
all
of
the
states
segregation
policies
and
laws.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
i
--
i
think
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
that
here
we
have
enforced
custom
of
segregation.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
not
by
the
trespass
statute.
but
what
the
state
does
here
is
to
come
in
and
enforce
it
through
the
arresting
and
charging
and
fining
and
convicting.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
yes
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
and
supported
by
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
state
law.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
a
state
statute
which
made
it
unlawful
for
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
oh,
i
see.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
i
would
think
that
would
be
vague,
yes
sir.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
see
what
you
mean,
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
don't
believe
--
is
there?
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
i
have
this
quote
from
a
committee
or
house
report
here,
which
says
that
state
action
may
under
some
circumstances
be
involved
where
the
state
lends
it
aid
to
the
enforcement
of
discriminatory
practices
carried
on
by
private
persons.
this
is
shelley
against
kraemer.
the
court
held
that
judicial
enforcement
of
private
restricted
covenants
constituted
state
action
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
so
they
specifically
had
shelley
in
mind
as
you
see.
the
court
characterized
the
case
as
one
in
which
the
states
have
made
available
to
individuals
desiring
to
impose
racial
discrimination
of
full
coercive
power
of
government,
and
then
they
cite
barrows
--
boman
against
birmingham
which
is
a
fifth
circuit
case
and
lombard
which
was
the
decision
of
this
court,
so
that
its
clear
that
they
had
in
mind
are
shelley
argument
in
this
situation.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
but
i'm
saying
there
--
they
interpreted
shelley
the
way
we've
argued
it
here,
i
would
say.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
where
is
it?
its
110
of
congressional
record
1463.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
think
it's
the
same
thing
mr.
greenberg
read
earlier.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
believe
that's
the
south
carolina
one.
they
went
into
a
discussion
of
custom
and
the
testimony
of
the
manager
was,
in
the
south
carolina
case
if
that
was
what
he
was
following,
the
officer
also
said
there's
no
law,
it's
custom.
i
would
like
to
move
now
to
petitioner's
due
process
claims
in
this
case.
petitioners'
claims
with
respect
to
due
process
are
the
following.
first,
these
petitioners
claim
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
in
this
case
to
convict
petitioners
of
failing
to
obey
the
store
manager's
order
to
leave
the
premises
since
no
such
order
was
in
fact
given,
the
only
order
given
being
an
order
to
leave
the
luncheon
area.
the
second
claim
is
that
the
plain
words
of
the
trespass
statute
here
under
which
petitioners
were
convicted
gave
no
fair
warning
that
a
failure
to
obey
an
order
to
leave
the
luncheon
area
was
tantamount
to
a
failure
to
obey
an
order
to
leave
the
premises
which
is
the
effect
of
the
affirmance
of
petitioners'
convictions
here
by
the
arkansas
supreme
court.
as
in
the
previous
case,
these
petitioners
are
two
negro
college
students
attending
college
in
little
rock
and
on
april
13,
1960,
they
went
into
blass'
department
store
in
little
rock.
when
these
petitioners
arrived,
as
i've
said
earlier,
they
were
observed
by
police
officer
bair
who
followed
them
along
with
a
few
other
negro
students
into
the
store
and
observed
them
sitting
themselves
in
the
luncheon
area
located
on
the
mezzanine
level.
officer
bair
immediately
left
the
store
and
reported
his
observations
to
police
headquarters.
two
other
police
officers
were
sent
to
by
headquarters
to
join
officer
bair.
the
manager
of
the
store,
mr.
holt,
observed
as
he
said,
“five
negro
boys
sitting
in
the
lunch
room,
three
at
the
counter
and
two
sat
at
the
table.”
he
then
testified
that
he
told
each
one
of
them
in
turn
that
he
didn't
want
any
disturbance
and
asked
them
to
leave.
they
refused.
the
manager
left
the
store
and
across
the
street
found
police
captain
terrell
and
lieutenant
talbot.
the
mnager
returned
to
the
store
with
the
police
officer
and
identified
petitioner
as
being
among
the
five
negro
boys
he
had
asked
to
leave
the
lunch
area.
petitioners
were
on
the
main
floor
on
their
way
out
at
this
time,
which
was
two
to
five
minutes
after
the
original
encounter
with
the
manager.
the
incident
took
place
between
11:30
and
12:00.
the
assistant
store
manager
as
i
said
before
testified
that
he
too
saw
these
boys
and
he
said
to
one
of
them
not
the
petitioner
that,
“we're
just
not
prepared
to
serve
you
would
you
please
excuse
yourself?”
none
of
the
officers
actually
heard
the
manager
order
these
petitioners
to
leave
the
premises,
but
captain
terrell
testified
on
this
case.
and
on
page
29
of
the
record,
in
two
places,
captain
terrell
said
this,
“he”
referring
to
the
manager
“had
requested
our
assistance
to
get
them
out
from
the
lunch
counter
when
he
came
over
to
get
us”.
then
captain
terrell
said
on
the
same
page,
“he
told
us
that
he
had
two
boys
that
had
refused
to
leave
the
lunch
counter
and
asked
that
we
assist
them”.
in
short,
there's
no
testimony
in
this
record
to
support
any
finding
that
the
petitioners
were
asked
to
leave
the
premises
as
required
by
the
statute
here
for
conviction.
petitioners
were
at
all
times
orderly
and
they
were
arrested
on
an
open
charge
and
then
they
were
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right,
that
--
the
--
and
that
the
manager's
testimony
is
ambiguous.
he
just
said
i
asked
them
to
leave,
but
then
the
officer
makes
clear,
and
he
was
the
state's
witness
as
to
what
the
order
was
that
the
manager
gave.
the
manager
doesn't
quote
his
exact
words
but
the
officer
purported
to
quote
exactly
what
the
manager
had
said
to
him.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
i
don't
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
think
that's
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
that
it
shows
positively
that
at
all.
we
say
it
does
not.
what
is
positively
shown
is
what
the
officer
says
that
the
order
was.
he's
the
only
one
who
dealt
really
specifically
with
what
the
order
here
is.
and
then
if
you'll
look
at
the
facts
here,
here
was
a
store
open
to
the
public
including
negroes
and
the
petitioners
had
been
in
there
purchasing,
and
it
just
is
not
reasonable
to
think
that
the
manager
was
saying,
“get
out
of
the
store”
as
a
whole.
he
was
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
then
let
me
say
that
the
only
clear
testimony
in
this
case
is
that
the
order
was
to
leave
the
lunch
counter.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right,
this
is
a
criminal
statute
and
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
in
virginia
your
honor
i
understand
that
it's
in
our
brief,
they're
trying
to
find
now
there
is
such
a
statute.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
page
75
of
our
brief.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
you
may
be
guilty
of
a
civil
trespass
but
i
don't
think
you
can
be
punished
on
the
statute
which
required
you
in
plain
language
to
be
ordered
to
leave
the
premises.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes
it
does.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
there
is
none.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
true.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
that's
true.
there
is
no
evidence
about
it.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
the
warrant
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
they
were
--
i
don't
have
a
copy
of
the
warrant
here.
in
the
lupper
case
--
no,
i
don't
think
there
is
a
copy
of
the
warrants
probably,
it's
a
copy
of
the
information
i
guess
on
page
3
that
i'm
looking
at.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
there
are
two
as
to
act
14,
it
said
defendant's
--
no
there
is
not
--
i
don't
--
that's
not
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
it
merely
recites
what
took
place
in
that
at
the
beginning
here.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
that
was
the
defendant's
motion
to
quash.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i'm
not
certain
if
that
is
a
recital
of
exactly
what
the
information
charged
but
i
thought
there
was
copy
of
the
information
at
the
beginning
but
apparently
not.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes
sir,
it
was
raised
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
in
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas,
and
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
passed
on
it
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
not
precisely
in
these
terms.
but
they
said
the
statute
was
clear
that
what
was
required
was
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
for
conviction
was
the
refusal
to
leave
the
premises
and
there
was
no
ambiguity
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
but
vagueness
was
definitely
one
of
the
issues
before
the
state
court
here.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
i'd
like
to
just
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
bouie
case
which
was
here
last
term
involving
a
similar
situation.
there's
a
sit-in
and
involving
a
criminal
trespass
statute
where
this
court
reversed
the
convictions
under
that
south
carolina
statute
on
the
ground
that
the
petitioners
there
had
not
been
forewarned
by
the
statute
or
any
prior
court
decision
that
a
statute
prohibiting
entry
after
warning
would
also
apply
to
a
refusal
to
leave
after
being
invited.
so,
this
is
the
same
kind
of
situation
here
where
we
have
a
statute
which
clearly
requires
an
order
to
leave
the
premises
being
construed
by
a
court
to
allow
conviction
for
a
refusal
to
leave
a
part
of
the
premises.
this,
of
course
the
petitioners
had
no
warning
of.
and
of
course
this
court
has
held
previously
in
several
cases
now
that
where
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
crime
charged,
this
also
violates
due
process
of
law.
i'd
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
rise
simply
to
point
out
those
places
in
the
record
where
the
manager
testified
as
to
the
time
which
elapsed
between
the
time
he
asked
them
to
leave
and
he
got
the
police
and
came
back.
on
page
47
on
direct
examination,
he
was
asked
by
the
state's
attorney.
question,
“about
how
long
would
you
say
you
were
gone
from
when
you
left
to
go
to
get
the
officers
until
you
came
back?
how
many
minutes
would
you
say
approximately?”
answer
“oh,
two
or
three
minutes
i
guess,
perhaps
five
no
more”.
and
then
on
cross-examination
by
these
petitioners'
counsel,
he
was
asked
that
question
again
and
he
was
asked
this
question
by
mr.
anderson.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
page
51,
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
mention
the
page.
the
first
page
was
page
47,
and
now
on
page
51
on
cross-examination,
“you
say
it
took
three
minutes
to
go
down
and
get
the
officers,
is
that
correct?”
answer
“something
like
that”.
so
that
was
gone
over
with
the
manager
and
locations
as
to
the
time
element
involved.
and
then
the
manager
seems
to
be
quite
sure
that
there
were
only
five
negro
boys
involved
here.
on
page
46
of
the
record,
he
states
what
he
observed
and
he
said,
“there
were
five
negro
boys”.
and
then
again
on
page
51,
again
on
the
cross-examination,
he
was
asked
“now,
again,
how
many
colored
men
were
there?”
answer
“five”.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
i
was
simply
pointing
out
that
the
--
there
were
some
questions
from
the
court
as
to
what
time
elapsed
before
the
manager
returned
on
the
question
of
whether
they
were
leaving
the
store
as
the
officers
came
in
whether
they
left
the
lunch
counter.
and
it
seems
relevant
that
they
did
by
this
testimony,
leave
immediately
upon
being
requested
to
do
so.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that
they
refused
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
now,
the
other
issue
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
there
is
no
evidence
to
the
contrary,
that
is
there's
no
evidence
that
they
just
stayed
there
and
persisted
and
would
not
leave
the
place
altogether.
this
tends
to
show
that
they
were
requested
to
leave
and
they
came
out
of
the
lunch
counter
and
were
out
of
the
way.
they're
on
their
way
out
of
the
store.
now,
the
second
point
as
to
how
many
were
there,
it
was
pointed
out
for
this
reason
that
there's
a
suggestion
that
they
were
not
denied
service
because
of
their
race,
but
because
there
was
a
large
group
of
men
demonstrating,
and
the
manager
did
not
have
that
impression
at
all.
he
testified
twice
that
there
were
only
five
and
he
emphasized
negro
boys
again
to
make
the
point
that
this
was
a
denial
on
account
of
their
race.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no
sir,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
at
all
--

to
indicate
that

no
sir.
ms.

there's
no
issue
on
that
and
the
business
of
the
lunch
counter
being
limited
to
women
or
patronized
predominantly
by
women
is
no
where
in
the
record.
ms.

that's
right.
they
were
not
misled
as
to
what
this
denial
was
based
on.
they
stated
it
emphatically
that
all
of
these
cases
were
sit-in
demonstrations
involving
negroes
denied
service
on
account
of
their
race.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
they
--
there
was
testimony
to
that
effect,
but
i
think
that
they
did
go
there
for
the
purpose
of
attempting
to
secure
service
which
they
probably
understood
would
be
denied
because
of
their
race.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
they
went
there
to
try
to
end
the
policy
of
discrimination.
