justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
doesn't
include,
mr.
greenberg,
disorderly
person
conviction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
use
of
disorderly
conduct
statutes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
great
number
of
them
are
where
they
abuse
trespass
statutes,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they're
all
cases
in
which
there
are
actually
outstanding
convictions,
are
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i'm
just
wondering,
i
know
i'm
anticipating
your
argument
a
little,
but
i
wondered
whether
you
would
apply
the
same
analysis
to
a
conviction
for
disorderly
conduct
that
you
would
for
a
conviction
under
trespass
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
greenberg,
do
i
correctly
infer
then
that
certainly
in
this
first
case,
this
is
the
hand
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
may
also
be
true
i
suppose
the
(inaudible)
there's
nothing
in
the
record
of
each
--
of
either
is
there,
which
affirmatively
indicates
a
basis
upon
which
one
could
conclude
that
these
are
covered
establishments
within
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
he
ever
say
that
they
offered
to
serve
and
in
fact
served
--
or
in
fact
served
even
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
interstate
travelers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
did
he
say
anything
at
all
about
the
quantity
of
food
which
moved
in
interstate
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
commerce
which
he
served?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
true
also,
the
(inaudible)
record,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
answer
is
that
you
don't
need
that
in
order
to
bring
it
within
the
civil
rights
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
not
asking
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
not
asking
us
then
to
--
this
is
not
an
argument
based
--
appealing
to
judicial
notice,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
greenberg,
it's
still
true
that
accepting
that
premise,
the
establishments
that
are
covered
are
only
those
within
the
definition,
are
they
not
of
(c)
(d),
serves
or
offers
to
serve
interstate
travelers
to
a
substantial
course
of
food
which
it
served
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
so
far
there's
move
in
commerce.
it
doesn't
reach
every
restaurant.
only
restaurants
that
satisfy
that
description,
isn't
that
true?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
might
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
--
in
other
words
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
vagueness
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
even
where
--
we
decide
that
the
use
of
the
trespass
statute,
any
situations
is
not
for
purposes
of
section
1
standing
alone
state
action.
are
you
suggesting
that
congress
however
could
say
it
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
would
say
in
other
words
by
definition
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
the
use
of
the
trespass
statute
in
these
situations
did
constitute
state
action
for
the
purposes
of
section
1?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
we
had
held
contrary
in
the
absence
of
such
a
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
answered
by
the
last
section
of
the
act?
the
remedy
shall
be
exclusive.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you'd
have
to
go
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
the
same
mr.
greenberg
if
the
act
establishes
a
presumption
and
it's
upon
whoever
takes
the
position
that
it
is
not
a
covered
establishment.
he
has
the
burden
of
proof
that
it's
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
that's
not
a
presumption,
but
--
what
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
know,
but
may
the
storeowner
come
in
and
show
that
the
facts
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
coverage
under
(d)
(2)
say
--
suggest
that
earlier
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
even
if
it's
were
purely
local
hamburger
stand?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
if
we
have
it
treat
it
that
way
that
nevertheless
this
covers
under
(d)
(2)
for
the
purpose
of
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
mr.
greenberg,
it
has
the
effect
of
invalidating
the
convictions
unless
explicitly
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
congress
had
said
they
should
be
served
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
occurred
(inaudible)
required
or
enforced?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
your
answer
to
justice
goldberg
mr.
attorney
general,
are
you
saying
that
the
facts
would
not
demonstrate
that
indeed
if
this
lunch
counter,
the
food
served
in
substantial
part
came
from
out-of-state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
--
i'm
not
talking
about
the
facts
in
the
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
justice
white
suggested
that
we
remanded
this
case,
re
--
finding
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
on
this,
is
there
any
question
that
it'd
be
ample
evidence
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it
came
within
that
definition?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
am
i
correct
in
it
about
the
(inaudible)
--
to
the
history
of
that
word,
secured
in
203?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
--
there
a
history
to
the
word
secured
in
203?
in
other
words,
what's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
other
--
that
was
different
language,
wasn't
it?
didn't
--
finally
evolved
or
ended
up
was
the
word
secured?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
--
do
you
suggest
for
the
reason
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
they
thought
there
was
a
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
needed
federal
protection,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
the
civil
rights
act
is
part
and
parcel
of
a
particular
state
law
that
the
supreme
court
of
different
states
might
construe
it
differently
and
apply
it
differently
in
terms
of
its
effect
as
an
abatement
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
be
uniformed,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
rather
unique
to
suggest
that
a
federal
statute
might
be
differently
interpreted
by
50
different
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
senator
motley,
what
do
you
say
about
the
record
indicating
coverage
of
this
establishment
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
locally
owned
or
something
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
record
doesn't
show
that
its
one
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
national
chain.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
you're
saying,
i
gather
am
i
right
mrs.
motley,
is
that
--
the
private
choice
is
not
in
fact
a
private
choice.
it's
a
choice
pursuant
to
custom
established
approved
in
the
manner
that
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
suggested
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
trespass
statute
then
is
used
to
enforce
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
not
by
private
choice
but
custom,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
on
the
motion
to
quash
of
this
recital,
i
guess
this
is
the
defendant's
motion
to
quash
and
its
--
the
contention
is
that
act
226
and
so
forth
under
which
these
defendants
have
been
charged
with
creating
a
disturbance
or
breach
of
the
peace
and
act
14
under
which
these
defendants
have
been
charged
with
failure
to
leave
the
business
premises
of
the
store
at
the
request
of
the
management.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
a
recital
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
lessenberry
(inaudible)
precedes
to
that
you
referred
us
to,
is
the
officer
i
gather
testifying,
“i
asked
them
were
they
the
ones
at
the
lunch
counter,
and
had
mr.
holt
asked
them
to
leave,
they
said
yes,
they
wanted
to
be
served”.
but
i'm
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
saying,
are
you
positive
they
told
them
they
refused
to
leave,
they
said
that
they
had
been
asked
to
leave,
you
suggest
there
was
(inaudible)
they
were
asked
to
leave
the
store
rather
than--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
just
the
lunch
counter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
in
page
1,
mr.
lessenberry,
i
think
you've
just
argued
did
you
not,
that
these
folks
were
looking
to
violate
a
law
and
to
be
arrested?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
significant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i'm
just
wondering,
isn't
that
argument
foreclosed
to
what
we
held
in
bouie?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
what
we
held
in
bouie
versus
city
of
columbia
where
we
said
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
we
said
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
we
said
was
we
think
it
irrelevant
that
petitioners
at
one
point
testified,
as
they
did
there
and
did
not
here,
that
they
had
intended
to
be
arrested,
determination
whether
a
criminal
statute
provides
fair
warning
of
its
prohibition,
must
be
made
on
the
basis
of
the
statute
itself
and
the
other
pertinent
law
rather
than
on
the
basis
of
an
ad
hoc
appraisal
of
the
expectations
of
particular
defendants.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
may
distinguish
the
statutes
but
i'd
wondered
if
this
doesn't
foreclose
the
relevancy
of
the
arguments
you've
just
made
that
because
they
expected
to
be
arrested,
they're
not
to
be
heard
to
argue
that
the
statute
was
vague.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
says
it
had
the
court's
instructions
that
the
jury
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
which
indicates
at
the
end
of
this
conversation
how
long
it
was
before
they
get
up?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
indeed
then
not
only
had
they
left,
they'd
come
downstairs,
had
they
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
officers
said
they
were
on
the
way
out
of
the
store
when
they
intercepted
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they
met
up
with
them
downstairs
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
after
they
had
left
the
lunch
counter
and
come
down
to
the
ground
floor,
did
they
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
officer
said,
i
don't
know
the
(inaudible)
--
exactly
where,
all
he
said
was
they
were
leaving
the
store.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
would
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
record
doesn't
show
it
played
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page
is
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
a
(inaudible)
rule
argument?
