what
more
do
you
need?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
these
cases
were
remanded
to
make
the
record
on
coverage?
what
would
the
state
in
--
what
would
the
state
think
would
be
necessary
to
show
that
the
act
did
cover
mcleod
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
others
than
the
fact
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
kind
of
evidence?
what
more
do
you
need
in
the
fact
that
it
was
serving
the
public
taking
all
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
saying
--
i'm
not
suggesting
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i
think
you're
wrong
or
anything
like
that,
but
you
really
do
think
that
this
is
a
meaningful
issue
in
the
--
in
this
--
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
your
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
about
coverage?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
there
was
a
remand
to
make
a
record
on
coverage
that
there
would
be
any
problem
of
any
--
is
there
really
any
question
what
the
answer
is
on
coverage
in
your
mind?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
--
but
do
you
really
think
it's
a
really
meaningful
thing
to
--
though
that
you
would
--
a
meaningful
prospect
for
you
if
there
was
a
remand?
would
that
a
(inaudible)
--
a
real
--
really
a
substantial
question
in
your
mind
about
coverage?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
sir.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
don't
request
that
the
act
should
be
remanded
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
coverage?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
that
it
applies
only
to
the
future,
but
what
about
the
case
that
hasn't
been
tried
yet?what
about
the
conviction
that
has
not
been
had
yet?
are
you
distinguishing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
between
that
case
and
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
arrest
that's
been
made
and
the
charge
that's
been
made
but
the
case
in
which
the
trial
hasn't
been
had
yet?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
didn't
ask
that,
but
assume
there
is
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
your
argument
as
applied
to
that
kind
of
a
case?
you're
saying
that
this
--
to
--
that
this
would
not
apply
to
such
a
future
conviction
in
such
a
future
imposition
of
a
punishment?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
this
service
in
a
covered
establishment
arise
or
when
did
it
arise,
with
the
passage
of
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
suppose
the
law
became
effective
when
it
was
passed,
and
this
was
for
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
right
of
--
to
the
right
that
has
created
by
201
and
202
that
right's
origin
is
with
the
passage
of
the
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
you
have
it
--
i
understand
that
you
have
a
constitutional
argument
also
you
might
turn
to,
but
insofar
as
the
act
is
concerned
and
if
the
language,
section
203,
it
says
--
it
refers
to
the
right
through
privileges
secured
by
section
201
and
202.
now,
when
those
rights,
i
would
assume
arose
with
the
--
as
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned
with
the
passage
of
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
i
suppose
if
we
--
if
your
preemption
or
your
federal
supremacy
argument
to
abate
these
actions
is
to
succeed
then,
i
suppose
you
are
saying
that
the
court
must
decide
whether
there
was
a
right
to
servicing
these
establishments
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
otherwise
section
203
doesn't
reach
your
argument.
section
203
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
says
no
one
will
interfere
with
the
--
or
try
to
punish
anyone
for
exercising
the
rights
secured
by
201
or
202.
well,
if
the
right
under
those
two
sections
was
created
with
the
passage
of
the
act,
these
particular
defendants
were
not
exercising
any
right
secured
by
the
section
201
or
202,
these
defendants
need
cases
they
committed
their
act
before
there
even
--
the
act
was
passed.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
the
act
says
that
you
shall
not
punish
anyone
for
excer
--
for
doing
an
act
which
before
the
statute
he
had
no
right
to
do
but
which
after
the
statute
he
has
a
right
to
do
it,
that's
the
meaning
of
203?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
doesn't
require
anybody
to
follow
the
custom,
it
doesn't
require
anybody
to
follow
it
--
if
some
storeowner
wants
to
truly
do
business
with
the
public,
the
state
doesn't
prevent
him,
it
doesn't
require
him
to
discriminate.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you're
giving
--
you're
giving
a
particular
reading
or
particular
interpretation
to
enforce
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
--
what
you
would
--
would
you
really
urge
us
to
remand
the
purpose,
the
effect
--
if
that's
all
(inaudible)
the
case,
the
only
question
our
mind
is
whether
or
not
the
act
covers
this
request
to
leave?
would
you
really
urge
us
to
remand
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
store
manager
asked
these
people
to
believe
--
to
leave
on
account
of
race?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
don't
they?
as
to
why
they
asked
them
to
leave?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
(voice
ocerlap)
--
how
about
this
one
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that,
i'm
--
but
if
it
were
the
only
question
that
remained
in
this
case
as
to
whether
or
not
these
people
were
required
to
--
requested
to
leave
on
account
of
race,
would
you
really
want
to
remand
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
alright.
