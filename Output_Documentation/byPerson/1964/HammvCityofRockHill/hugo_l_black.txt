justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
you
said
to
a
certain
extent
a
constitutional
argument.
how
could
it
be
other
than
a
constitutional
argument
to
say
that
congress
has
power
to
abate
cases
which
were
perfectly
constitutionally
started
for
the
act
if
he
has
power
abate
them?why
does
not
--
to
have
raised
a
constitutional
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
this
point,
if
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
cover
it,
if
standing
by
itself
as
was
argued,
how
can
congress
expand
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
by
saying
it
does
cover
it,
the
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
make
a
state
action
out
of
a
custom.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
is
it?
i
understood
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
didn't
cover
it
and
it
was
stated
as
there
was
a
statement,
there
were
statements
to
the
effect
that
congress
could
do
it
much
better
probably,
because
it
could
draw
necessarily
lines.
but
i
do
not
recall
in
the
statement
that
said
that
congress
could
do
something
which
the
amendment,
first
section
of
the
amendment
didn't
authorize.
now,
if
we
didn't
touch
on
section
5.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
inchoate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
even
under
the
first
section
or
under
the
fifth
section?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
that's
the
different
point.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
it's
to
argue
what
congress
did?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
congress
did
that,
the
question
of
justice
brennan
asked.
you
think
they
did?
justice
hugo
l.
black
didn't
say
anything
about
trespass
statute
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
in
the
contrary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
man
of
any
color
who
goes
in
to
a
place
and
the
man
doesn't
want
to
serve
him,
what
is
your
argument
there
as
to
his
power
to
make
him
do
so
by
his
own
actions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
after
the
amendment
was
passed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
want
to
delay
you,
what
i
understand
that
you
are
arguing
and
unless
i'm
mistaken,
all
that
you're
arguing
on
this
point
here
that
if
it
be
found
by
whatever
method
you
want
to
find,
congress
intended
to
bar
these
prosecutions,
it
had
the
power
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
congress
had
done
it,
said,
“we're
not
going
to
do
it”,
you
wouldn't
argue
that
they
were
not
--
they
were
barred,
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
congress
had
said
this
shall
have
no
effect
on
pending
prosecution
either
in
state
courts,
suppose
it
had
said
it,
would
you
argue
that
was
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
--
i
understand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that's
really
a
different
an
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
so
if
we
get
down
to
the
point,
whether
you
call
it
intention
or
not
on
--
that
you
are
arguing,
is
whether
the
act
really
does
bar
such
prosecutions.
the
only
way
we
can
do
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
to
read
the
act
and
history
and
so
forth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
get
to
that,
you
wouldn't
say
it's
a
constitutional
rule
would
you?
if
congress
had
compelled
to
do
it
explicitly
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
to
serve
it
explicitly
of
it's
reserved.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that's
true,
why
isn't
--
you
hold
the
issue
whether
this
is
applied
to
be
applied
using
justice
harlan's
term
recognizing
it
(inaudible)
take
it
retroactively?
why
isn't
that
the
only
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
only
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anywhere
else
except
on
page
78?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
main
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
one
you
just
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
cross
examined?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
that
the
statute
is
valid,
but
first
the
statute
is
valid,
gets
a
--
could
not
be
validly
applied
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
a
man
who
came
in
to
the
store
but
when
the
storeowner
urges
him
to
leave
a
particular
part
of
the
store
in
which
he
was
there,
is
it
your
--
your
contention
that
would
make
it
invalid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
if
a
state
have
a
statute,
if
construed,
meaning
that
a
man
cannot
trespass
on
their
whole
premises,
cannot
trespass
on
the
part
of
the
premises
against
the
owner's
consent,
then
it
would
be
invalid
(inaudible)
or
part
of
the
premises?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
claim
that
was
too
vague?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voive
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
constitutional
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
you
making
an
argument
on
the
constitution.
suppose
they
violated
the
law,
a
valid
law,
would
you
still
say
that
their
bravery
violated
a
valid
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
justified
as
inspecting?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
would
you
define
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
customs?
how
would
you
define
the
custom
so
as
to
make
it
specific
and
definite
like
a
law
as
speech?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
what
percentage
of
the
community?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words
state
action
would
be
something
less
than
law
as
you
understand
it
and
it
would
be
--
all
you'd
have
to
prove
would
be
--
by
in
some
way
to
people
voluntarily
followed
a
habit
of
doing
things
to
a
certain
weight?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
judgment
that
a
statute
which
made
it
unlawful
either
federal
or
state,
by
a
person
to
follow
a
custom
or
to
violate
a
custom
would
(inaudible)
with
the
requirements
of
due
process?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
a
crime
either
to
follow
a
custom
or
not
to
follow
a
custom,
do
you
think
that
would
be
definite
enough
to
withstand
an
attack
on
the
ground
that
was
too
vague
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
comply
with
due
process?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
point
that
--
why
i
was
asking
you
what
you
meant
by
custom.
i
understand
the
other
arguments
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
where
there
are
laws,
state
laws
that
you
rely
on,
not
shelley
and
kraemer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
this
case
tried
by
a
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
charge
in
(inaudible)
charge
from
the
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
think
there's
any
doubt
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
was
there
any
other
reason
this
court
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
was
--
was
reference
carrying
out
did
he
have
a
policy
against
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
(voice
overlap)
on
abstractions
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
are
not
denying
that
since
the
civil
rights
act
they
do
have
a
right
to
go
into
such
a
restaurant
(inaudible)
and
is
covered?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
court
--
i
believe
they
charged,
are
these
the
only
charges?
those
that
appear
--
is
all
the
charge
in
the
record
the
court
charged
to
the
jury?
what
i'm
ask
--
what
i'm
interested
in,
did
he
make
any
distinction
between
finding
them
guilty
of
not
leaving
on
the
basis
of
their
color
and
on
the
basis
of
what
you've
been
arguing
if
they
came
with
a
good
big
group,
people
have
sent
out
or
stayed
there
and
blocked
access
or
whatever
you
call
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
such
issue
raised
before
the
jury
or
any
courts'
charge
or
by
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
distinction
drawn
by
written
charge
or
anything
else
that
you
called
the
jury's
attention
to
the
facts
that
if
it
was
done
in
the
kind
of
race,
it
was
wrong,
and
if
it
was
done
for
some
other
reasons,
they
can
be
convicted.
was
there
any
such
charge
requested
by
either
side?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
issue
was
raised
by
the
defendants
in
a
motion
to
quash,
what
was
then
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
motion
to
quash?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
mean
what
happened
in
connection
with
it?
were
they
declined
the
right
to
offer
evidence
on
that
claim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
swear
to
believe
the
issue
(inaudible)
and
motion
to
dismiss
that
i'm
talking
about
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
applied
to
them,
this
would
be
bad
because
it
attempted
to
discriminate
against
them
wholly
on
account
of
their
color.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
relevance
of
that
to
your
argument,
would
you
mind
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
on
the
premise
that
it
would
--
there's
no
evidence
to
show
that
they
left
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
they
remained
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
refused
to
leave
after
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
being
directed
to
do
so
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right,
on
that
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
is
there
any
evidence
to
the
contrary
of
that
to
which
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
record
justifies
an
argument
along
the
lines
that
was
made
that
there
was
evidence
to
show
that
despite
the
fact
that
it
might
have
been
racial
discrimination
the
real
reason
they
were
ordered
out
was
because
they
were
in
numbers
and
at
a
place
that
interfered
with
the
business
quite
apart
from
their
race?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
there's
no
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
issue
on
that
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
nothing
in
the
record?
