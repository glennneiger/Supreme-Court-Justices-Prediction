do
you
take
a
different
position
what
the
counsel
did
last
monday?
justice
tom
c.
clark
attorney
general
mcleod,
do
you
have
a
copy
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
constitution?
justice
tom
c.
clark
would
you
look
at
section
201
(b).
justice
tom
c.
clark
establishment
which
serves
the
public
is
a
place
of
accommodation
within
the
meaning
of
this
title.
that
provides
two
standards,
one
if
its
operations
affect
commerce
and
the
second,
or
if
discrimination
or
segregation
is
supported
by
state
action.
now,
you
go
down
to
(c),
and
(c)
defines
the
operations
of
an
establishment
that
affect
commerce.
so
(c)
is
not
material
if
the
second
clause
of
the
first
sentence
of
201
(b)
is
applicable,
if
discrimination
or
segregation
--
by
the
--
supported
by
state
action.
justice
tom
c.
clark
so
why
isn't
justice
white's
question
quite
relevant?
what
would
be
necessary
--
what
could
be
shown
or
what
would
be
necessary
to
be
shown
in
addition
to
what
we
already
know
to
bring
it
under
the
second
clause
of
the
first
sentence
of
201
(b)?
justice
tom
c.
clark
no.

state
action

justice

or
if
discrimination
or
segregation
by
the
support
of
a
state
action

justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
i
would
(voice

--
justice
tom
c.
clark
there
would
be
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
there
would
be
questions
remaining
yes,
but
there
would
be
different
kinds
of
questions
in
the
questions
on
the
commerce
level,
wouldn't
they?
justice
tom
c.
clark
yes.
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
whether
or
not
this
civil
rights
act
rests
solely
on
the
commerce
clause
and
whether
it
also
enforces
the
powers
of
congress
under
section
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
tom
c.
clark
right
under

c.

now,
on
page
28,
toward
the
--
the
three
portions
away
from
the
top
of
the
page,
“alright,
you
have
stated
that
mr.
whitaker
asked
reverend
ivory
to
leave.
what
if
anything

did
reverend
ivory
do
or
say
responsive
thereto
reverend
ivory
nor
arthur
hamm
neither
one
made
any
attempt
to
leave.
and
at
that
time
captain
hunsaker
asked
him
if
he
understood
what
mr.
whitaker
had
told
him”.
the
further
part
is
not
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
they
were
ordered
to
leave
the
premises
or
just
a
portion
that
(voice

--
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
about
on
page
29,
about
four
or
five
questions
down,
“and
did
he”
that's
the
manager
“request
you
to
arrest
them?”
answer,
“he
did
and
he
had
requested
our
assistance
to
get
them
out
from
the
lunch
counter”.
justice

that's
what
the

being
requested
to
leave
the
lunch
counter
or
the

justice

but
they've
taken
a
charge
on
page
70,
do
you
agree
with
that,
they
they're
charged
--
the
judge
sent
down
a
charge
for
being
threatened
to
leave
the
lunch
counter
or
the
restaurant?
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
i
think
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
they
left
the
restaurant
though.
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
were
in
another
part
of
the
building
when
they
were
left
--
arrested?
justice
tom
c.
clark
it
said
they
have
to
leave
the
minute
that
it's
requested?
