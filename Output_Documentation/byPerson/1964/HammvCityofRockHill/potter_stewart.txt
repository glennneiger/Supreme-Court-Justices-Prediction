justice
potter
stewart
most
all
of
these
cases
date
back
to
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
sit-ins
in
1960?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
of
1960.
justice
potter
stewart
many
of
these
cases
wouldn't
--
the
record
wouldn't
show
whether
or
not
they
were
covered
by
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
would
they?
justice
potter
stewart
that
may
very
well
be
an
arguable
position
but
it's
a
much
broader
--
more
extreme
position
than
that
taken
by
the
solicitor
general
last
week
as
you
realized.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
know
what
he
would
do
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
but
i
still
remember
what
he
did
--
say.
justice
potter
stewart
then
you
don't
need
the
statute
at
all,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
something
declaratory.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
maybe,
but
that's
not
this
case,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
if
peterson
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
peterson
--
peterson
or
a
lombard
case
well,
then
we
don't
need
to
talk
about
the
statute
at
all,
do
we?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
whenever
you
have
a
state
court
conviction,
you
have
state
action.
justice
potter
stewart
at
state
action
isn't
what's
required.
it's
state
denial
of
rights
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment,
denial
by
a
state.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
--
it
couldn't
be
a
federal
conviction.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
you
could
--
somebody
could
be
convicted
for
disorderly
conduct
for
example,
if
the
evidence
showed
disorderly
conduct.
justice
potter
stewart
or
even
though
they
were
demanding
what
they
felt
they
were
entitled
to
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
fact
is
that
that
repealing
amendment
was
a
very,
very
specific
in
preserving
a
tremendous
autonomy
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
states.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
fourteenth
--
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
being
violated
directly,
then
you
don't
need
the
civil
rights
act
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
from
the
cases
of
lombard
and
all
the
rest
of
them.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
need
to
--
but
that's
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
those
were
the
facts,
that
the
fact
showed
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
state
of
south
carolina
were
denying
these
people
rights
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that'd
be
the
end
of
the
case.
you
wouldn't
be
making
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
wouldn't
have
to
bother
with
a
civil
rights
act.
justice
potter
stewart
this
restaurant,
is
it
covered,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
we
had
that
kind
of
a
case,
we
wouldn't
be
talking
about
the
civil
rights
act
at
all,
would
we?
we're
talking
about
peterson
and
lombard
and
those
decisions,
decided
before
the
enactment
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
a
restaurant,
isn't
it?
they
just
serve
salad
and
tomato
extract
and
things
like
that
to
mainly
the
(voice
overlap)
costumers?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
one
of
these
cases,
i
forgot
--
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
--
to
be
sure
that
i
understand
your
--
what
i
understood
to
be
your
answer
here
a
minute
ago.
you
say
that
if
this
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
trier
of
the
facts
that
there
would
be
no
question
in
your
mind
to
what
this
eating
establishment
was
covered
by
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
there
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
--
it
needs
to
be
such
a
disclaimer
in
order
to
be
outside
of
the
coverage
of
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
where
as
were
--
what
we're
both
doing
is
--
certainly
what
you're
doing
is
speculating
and
i'm
not
even
doing
that
much
because
i
don't
know,
i've
never
been
to
rock
hill.
but
--
do
i
understand
you
correctly
to
say
that
it
is
your
considered
judgment
that
this
eating
establishment
is
now
covered
by
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
as
i
mentioned?
justice
potter
stewart
now
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
do
you
think
that
on
remand
that
this
could
and
would
be
clearly
shown,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
do
with
203
(c)
of
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
says
no
person
shall
punish
or
attempt
to
punish
any
person
for
exercising
or
attempting
to
exercise
any
right
or
privilege
procured
by
section
201
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
202?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
--
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
that
the
--
under
the
statute,
once
he's
been
refused
service,
then
his
only
right
is
to
bring
a
lawsuit,
is
that
it,
that's
your
answer?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me,
go
ahead
now.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
right
down
at
the
portion
that
you
just
read
to
us
on
page
28,
the
reference
is
that
he
would
have
to
leave
the
counter,
just
continuing
what
you
in
the
middle
have
read?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
or
page
16
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
you've
already
read
to
us.
justice
potter
stewart
page
16,
which
you've
already
read
to
us.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
you're
suggesting
that
201
(d)
goes
beyond
a
declaration
of
existing
law,
of
existing
case
law,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
i'd
understood
mr.
greenberg
perhaps
misunderstood
him
to
say
that
the
--
that
that
section
was
no
more
than
declaratory
of
existing
case
law
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
lombard
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
other
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
perhaps
you
can
say
that.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
the
trouble
is
the
statute
doesn't
say
that,
it
has
--
had
to
be
required
or
enforced
the
action
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
particular
action
in
issue
has
to
be
required
or
enforced
by
state
officials.
justice
potter
stewart
when
you're
talking
about
stemming
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
you're
back
to
shelley
against
kraemer
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
indication
in
the
legislative
history
of
201
(d)
that
congress
intended
to
go
beyond
the
existing
case
law
in
this
matter
of
state
discrimination
and
what
was
state
discrimination?
justice
potter
stewart
and
specifically
that
there
was
any
intention
to
import
the
supposed
analogy
of
shelley
against
kraemer
into
this
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
a
--
really
they
review
the
decisions
in
capsule
form,
don't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
in
what
you've
read?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
think
the
way
you
read
it,
i
thought
they
were
just
reciting
what
shelley
held
on
its
own
fact?
justice
potter
stewart
without
interpretation.
well,
wait,
have
you
got
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
a
reference
to
that?
is
it
in
your
brief
or
--
i
must
read
it.
justice
potter
stewart
in
addition
to
the
pages
which
you
cited,
the
respondent
on
page
34
of
its
brief
cites
several
additional
pages,
pages
28,
33,
40,
42
and
44
and
you
--
i
would
have
a
chance
to
read
them
all
but
you
--
it's
your
position
that
none
of
these
supports
any
finding
at
all
that
they're
asked
to
leave
the
premises,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
asked
you
that
question
because
as
you
are
aware,
you
and
counsel
for
the
respondent
differ
as
to
what
the
record
shows.
they
say
very
positively
on
page
34
of
their
brief
that
the
record
does
show
that
they
were
asked
to
leave
the
premises
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
concede
that
there
might
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
would
suggest
that
that's
an
equally
reasonable
inference
after
they
had
refused
to
--
after
they'd
done
what
they
did.
justice
potter
stewart
if
we're
going
to
make
inferences.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lessenberry,
let's
assume
that
the
record
were
very
clear
and
unambiguous
as
senator
motley
as
told
as
it
is,
but
let's
assume
that
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
that
all
this
record
shows
is
that
they
--
that
these
petitioners
were
requested
to
leave
the
lunch
counter
that
there
was
no
argument
as
to
what
the
record
show
that
that's
all
it
showed,
that
there
were
clearly
unambiguously
requested
to
leave
the
lunch
counter
and
that
they
refused
to
do
so.
in
your
opinion,
would
this
arkansas
statute
apply?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
are
several
alternative
arguments
but
here
as
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
i
understand
it
you're
certainly
correct
as
to
one
of
their
alternatives.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
not
that
you
cannot
now
convict
them,
it's
that
you
cannot
now
punish
them.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
told
us
here
earlier
today
that
this
was
a
women's
tearoom
and
lunch
and
fashion
show
and
that
there's
every
reason
to
suppose
that
if
15
men,
white
men
had
shown
up,
demonstrating
for
any
reason
that
they
might
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
asked
to
please
leave.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
are
you
departing
from
that
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it
said
--
they've
been
accidental
or
occidental?
justice
potter
stewart
be
aware
of,
do
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
certainly
accepted
your
version
of
the
facts
didn't
it,
and
stated
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
other
hand,
the
record
doesn't
show
that
these
were
demonstrations.
it
shows
affirmatively
to
the
contrary,
doesn't
it?
these
people
said
they
didn't
know
each
other
before
and
--
