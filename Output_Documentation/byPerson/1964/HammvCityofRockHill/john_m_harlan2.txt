is
that
figure
(inaudible)
reasonably
accurate?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
before
the
civil
rights
act
was
passed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
what
you're
suggesting
now
is
on
the
premise
that
the
civil
rights
act
has
retroactive
application?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
taken
hold
in
these
cases,
the
commerce
clause
has
taken
hold.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
you
disclaimed
any
reliance
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
those
cases
and
it
went
further
than
that
and
argued
the
case
in
one
instance
on
a
record
where
it
was
stipulated
that
there
was
no
state
action.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.

and
what
is
the

you've
given
me
the

john
m.

4684,
what's
the

other
one?

(inaudible)
first
section
to
give
this
congress
power
only
with
the
reference
to
state
action.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
congress
had
said
explicitly
that
this
act
was
to
apply
to
past
prosecutions
to
refuse
us
to
serve
that
referred
to
illegal
at
the
time
that
they
were

that
they
occurred.
no
state
action
being
involved.
do
you
think
that
would
raise
a
kind
of
retroactivity
clause
as
raised
on
the
constitutional
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
in
such
a
clause
would
have
to
be
justified
because
that
kind
of
provision
could
be
said
they
have
effect
on
the
current
commerce.

john
m.

(inaudible)
present

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.

there's
a
definition
in
the

as
to
what
constitutes

201

justice
john

says

(inaudible)
negro
who
now
has
refused
service,
assuming
that
the
civil
rights
act
is
upheld,
cannot
plead
as
a
defense,
plead
the
action
as
to
the
defense
for
the
prosecution
of
trespass?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
statute
could
be
read
either
way.
justice
john
m.
harlan
when
that
specific
question
was
raised
i
had
to
come
through
to
accept
responsibility
to
this
bill
and
that
is
why
this
adversary
says

suggested
it
must
be
interpreted.

mr.
attorney
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
--
justice
john
m.

i
was
going
to
ask
you,
do
you
have
any
statutory
or
constitutional
--
state
constitutional
provision
that
requires
segregation
in
restaurants?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
early
sit-in
programs?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
the
sit-in
was
a
restaurant
--
sit-in
or
just
going
into
the
store
where
they
knew
there
would
be
no
problem
of
getting
(inaudible)
and
so
forth?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
was
the
restaurant
specifically
directed
the
arrest?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
the
early
sit-ins?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
this
vagueness
argument
raised
in
the
state
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)form
was
it
raised
in?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
in
your
brief
with
relation
to
due
process.
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
greenberg,
this
long
legislative
record
(inaudible)
is
there
any
debate,
any
indication
that
question
of
retroactivity,
if
i
may
use
that
word,
was
--
arose
in
any
stage
of
the
proceeding?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
would
be
a
pure
(inaudible)
of
state
law
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
argument
is
that
the
federal
statute
basically
affects
the
state
statute
with
the
purpose
of
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
is
that
--
and
therefore
the
court
should
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
--
the
premise
your
argument
is
that
the
statute
should
be
read
or
could
reasonably
have
been
read
in
--
referring
to
premises
as
meaning
that
the
refusal
that
the
request
had
to
be
to
leave
the
entire
premises?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
i
understand
that.
now,
let
me
ask
you
this,
are
there
any
state
statutes,
trespass,
any
state
trespass
statutes,
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
of
this
question
is
that
in
defining
trespass
are
worded
in
terms
of
refusal
to
leave
the
premises
in
toto
or
any
part
thereof.
do
you
know
of
any
such
state
statutes?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
virginia?
justice
john
m.
harlan
take
a
trespass
case
outside
of
the
context
of
the
present
cases.
if
i
go
in
to
macy's
store,
i
don't
happen
to
know
what
the
new
york
state
statute
is
but
i
think
i'm
correct
in
saying
that
it's
a
trespass
statute
in
leaving
the
premises
in
the
conventional
form.
if
i
go
into
macy's
store
and
i
do
my
purchasing
and
then
i
go
over
to
a
part
of
the
store
that
says
“employees
only”,
“employees
only”
and
i
insist
on
going
into
that
place
which
is
not
part
of
the
store
reserved
to
employees.
you
say
that
i
couldn't
constitutionally
--
and
then
i'm
asked
to
just
leave
that
part
of
the
--
just
asked
to
leave
that
part
of
the
premises
and
to
go
about
my
purchases
in
the
store.do
you
say
i
could
not
be
constitutionally
prosecuted
for
trespass
under
a
statute
which
referred
to
premises?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
just
wanted
to
get
your
point,
that's
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
--
certainly,
in
the
hamm
case
and
maybe
its
true
in
this
case
the
prosecution
rightly
or
wrongly
if
you
look
at
the
warrant
which
contains
the
charge
was
based
on
the
proposition
that
a
refusal
to
leave
the
lunch
counter
as
distinguished
in
the
store
constituted
the
trespass.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
clear
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
charge,
right
or
wrong?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
that's
the
charge
the
defendants
knew
was
being
preferred
against
them.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
equally
true
in
the
lupper
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
does
the
information
say
mrs.
senator?
justice
john
m.
harlan
never
mind.
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
about
(inaudible)
mr.
greenberg
said
that
in
the
hamm
case,
the
vagueness
point
that
you
are
now
addressing
yourself
to
was
not
raised
specifically
but
he
thought
adequately
in
terms
of
the
broader
question
which
involved
in
hamm
but
not
here
as
to
the
prosecutor's
refusal
to
elect
which
statute
he
was
proceeding
under.
was
the
vagueness
point
raised
in
the
lupper
case
below?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
they
construed
their
statute
as
meaning
leaving
the
lunch
counter
is
being
included
within
the
premises?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
warrant
to
which
these
people
were
charged?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
