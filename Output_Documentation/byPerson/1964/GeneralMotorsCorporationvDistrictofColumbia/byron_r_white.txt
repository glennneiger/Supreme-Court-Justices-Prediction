mr.
barnes,
how
would
--
how
would
general
motors
be
fair
here
if
the
district
had
a
gross
receipts
tax
like
washington
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
on
--
on
the
gross
receipts
from
wholesales
in
the
district?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
--
why
does
the
net
income
--
why
does
putting
a
tax
in
all
of
the
net
income
received
from
these
sales
--
why
is
that
unconstitutional
and
the
gross
receipts
tax
wouldn't
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
see
any
--
you
don't
see
it
--
fundamentally,
you
don't
see
any
inconsistency
at
all
between
your
position
here
and
in
the
washington
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
any
inconsistency
in
your
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
because
that's
a
gross
receipts
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
--
(inaudible)
whether
the
gross
income,
the
gross
receipts
tax
here
like
there
was
in
washington
at
that
rate,
what
would
have
been
the
tax
as
compared
to
this
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
sorry.
is
there
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
gave
me
--
you
gave
some
figures
a
while
ago
as
to
--
what
was
the
--
in
1957,
what
was
the
gross
here?
$5
million
--
$5,166,000
i
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
if
--
what
if
that
had
been
--
what
if
the
record
was
clear
in
that
regard?
that
wouldn't
change
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
position
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
on
--
on
either
--
on
due
process
or
any
other
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you
just
don't
have
to
get
to
this
position?
i
would
think
that
in
the
example
that
the
counsel
gave,
the
company
with
a
manufacturing
plant
in
maryland
and
making
all
of
its
sales
in
the
district,
you
would
tax
all
of
them,
you
would
in
--
you
would
take
all
--
tax
all
their
net
income.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
that
case
of
course,
it
would
be
clear
that
at
least
some
activities
outside
the
district
contributed
to
that
income.
so
you
would
be
taxing
net
income
derived
from
activities
outside
the
district.
and
you
just
about
have
to
get
to
that
position
i
take
it
and
say
that
well,
we
do
and
that
there's
nothing
unconstitutional
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that
--
is
that
really
different
from
what
you're
doing
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
question
is
whether
--
whether
the
district's
--
what
is
the
--
what
the
--
does
the
statute
require
this
method
or
does
it
authorize
it?
is
there
anything
unconstitutional
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
that
--
you
would
say
that
in
the
example,
the
single
corporation
example
is
that
the
district
could
if
it
wanted
to
tax
100%
of
these
sales
as
far
as
the
constitution
is
concerned.
isn't
that
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
really
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
will
ask
you
this
again.
do
you
concede
that
there's
really
any
fundamental
difference
between
the
example
that
i
gave
and
what
the
facts
are
here?
certainly
--
certainly,
it
would
seem
that
a
good
many
activities
outside
the
district
contributed
to
this
net
income
which
you
are
taxing
the
district.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
deny
that
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
taking
all
the
sales
the
--
the
--
you're
--
you're
claiming
the
credit
for
the
net
income
from
all
of
these
sales
within
the
district.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
(voice
overlap)
the
credit
for?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
asserting
that
there's
net
income
earned
in
the
district
of
columbia,
aren't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
--
and
you're
saying
it
was
--
it
was
derived
from
sales
in
the
district.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
where
are
you
saying
this
derived?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
the
tax
court
find
though
that
part
of
the
income
you
were
taxing
was
actually
earned
outside
the
district?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
--
that
if
you
thought
the
record
really
sustain
that
findings
that
you
might
have
to
arrive
at
another
method
of
taxing
general
motors.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
was
--
you
said
it
twice
now
and
i
still
don't
understand
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
goldberg's
question
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
--
if
it
were
clearly
shown
that
you
were
--
that
part
of
the
income
you
were
taxing
was
earned
outside
the
district,
didn't
you
answered
--
say
to
me
a
while
ago
that
you
might
well
have
to
find
another
way
of
taxing
general
motors?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
you
do
say
that
that
you
perfectly
justified
under
the
statute
constitutionally,
the
tax
income,
the
tax
in
the
district,
income
whether
or
not
it
is
earned
in
the
district.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
mr.
barnes
the
tax
court
seemed
--
it
seems
to
me
found
that
--
that
some
of
this
income
that
was
taxed
here
was
earned
elsewhere.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
--
do
you
read
the
court
of
apples
as
disturbing
that
finding?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
didn't
disturb
it
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
care
--
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
the
same
questions
as
to
whether
there
is
double
taxation
or
not.
the
question
is
whether
a
part
of
the
in
--
whether
it
disturbs
the
finding
that
part
of
the
income
was
earned
out
outside
the
district.
