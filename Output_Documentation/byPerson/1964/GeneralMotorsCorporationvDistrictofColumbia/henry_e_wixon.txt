mr.
henry
e.
wixon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
associates
are
mr.
chester
gray,
the
corporation
counsel,
mr.
milton
d.
korman,
the
principal
assistant
corporation
counsel,
and
mr.
robert
e.
mccally,
assistant
corporation
counsel
for
the
district
of
columbia.
this
case,
since
it
involves
a
statute
enacted
by
the
congress,
necessarily
revolves
around
the
propriety
of
the
commissioner's
implementing
regulation.
it's
conceded
that
the
statute
is
completely
valid
and
the
only
contention
as
i
understand
it
is
that
general
motors
as
a
consequence
of
the
application
of
the
district's
regulation
was
overtaxed.
i'm
unable
to
perceive
any
constitutional
involvements
here
certainly
insofar
as
such
an
involvement
might
relate
to
the
commerce
clause.
the
congress
is
not
inhibited
by
that
clause
within
the
next
legislation
for
the
district
of
columbia
of
this
type.
and
thus
it
might,
if
it
shows,
interfere
with
commerce
in
the
sense
that
the
state
might
not
so
interfere.
since
the
commerce
clause
does
not
seem
to
be
applicable,
i
would
conceive
further
that
if
the
commissioner's
regulations
comport
with
the
statute
then
if
the
statute
itself
might
impair
a
commerce
in
the
way
that
a
state
might
not
do
it,
then
the
commissioners
have
not
acted
improperly
or
invalidly
in
adopting
a
regulation
which
comports
with
the
statutory
requirements.
it
has
been
stated
by
counsel
and
if
there's
an
element
of
double
taxation
involved
in
this
case
where
the
element
of
double
taxation
has
never
been
proved
certainly
on
this
record.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
it
has
not
been
proved
on
this
record
sir.
it
has
been
argued
but
double
taxation
would
be
dependent
upon
a
showing
that
elements
which
the
district
undertook
to
tax
were
in
fact
taxed
by
another
jurisdiction.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
no
sir.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
it
wouldn't
change
my
position
because
of
this
mr.
justice
white.
if
the
congress
has
required
such
a
tax
to
be
imposed
in
its
position
as
the
overseer
of
the
district
of
columbia,
then
the
fact
that
there's
an
element
of
double
taxation
i
would
believe
would
not
invalidate
the
statute
on
the
one
hand
or
the
regulation
on
the
other.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
i
should
think
not
sir
because
the
congress
is
enacting
a
taxing
statute
for
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
if
we
use
this
regulation,
that
is
true
sir.
i
would
--
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
well,
i
don't
know
sir
whether
the
extreme
that
you
mentioned
would
be
supportable
or
not
but
if
it
were
not
supportable
and
i
would
suggest
sir
that
we
would
be
probably
required
to
adopt
some
other
method
of
determining
the
amount
of
income
in
the
case
of
a
corporation
to
which
you
refer
which
would
be
subject
to
taxes
income
derived
from
district
sources.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
well,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
has
in
its
decisions
and
in
its
statements
on
this
matter
why
it
clearly
indicated
that
if
in
the
particular
circumstances,
the
district's
regulatory
approach
is
not
an
adequate
approach
then
another
method
for
determining
the
amount
of
incomes
of
it
to
be
taxed
is
to
be
used
or
devised
if
you
will
sir.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
well
--
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
i
would
say
this
sir,
in
response
to
your
inquiry,
unless
the
statute
which
calls
such
a
result
of
this
presupposes
that
the
regulation
policy
statute
and
therefore
is
valid
of
itself
unless
the
statute
accomplishing
such
an
action
were
to
be
held
invalid
then
the
effect
to
which
you
allude
would
not
of
course
be
invalid
under
the
constitutional
premise.
but
i
have
to
assume
first
that
the
congress
might
achieve
such
a
result
constitutionally
before
i
can
respond
to
your
question.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
i
don't
know
the
answer
--
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
that
sir
--
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
but
it
depends
on
how
you
mean
that
sir.
any
apportionment
formula,
none
being
perfect,
is
going
to
in
some
degree
or
other
affect
theoretical
income,
economic
income,
however
it
may
be
termed,
obtained
by
the
taxpayer
to
activities
outside
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
no
sir.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
not
exactly.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
since
our
tax
or
our
apportionment
has
been
determined
upon
general
motors'
total
net
income
--
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
--
and
i
must
say
that
net
income
exclude
or
has
had
excluded
from
it
certain
sales
to
the
united
states
where
the
statute
does
not
permit
us
to
tax
the
income
from
the
sale.
it
will
--
that
net
income
was
determined
on
the
basis
of
all
gains
and
losses,
no
profit
or
profit
and
thus,
i
think
it's
somewhat
ephemeral
to
say
that
we're
taxing
100%
of
the
net
income
derived
from
these
sales
simply
because
it's
impossible
to
determine
that
net
income,
certainly
on
this
record.
now,
i
say
first
sir
that
if
we
did,
we'd
be
doing
exactly
what
the
statute
requires
because
we're
required
to
tax
the
amount
of
net
income
of
general
motors
which
was
derived
by
it
from
it's
business
of
--
trade
of
business
within
the
district
of
columbia,
not
part
of
it
but
all
of
it.
i
don't
--
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
oh
yes!
and
there's
undoubtedly
was.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
no
sir,
not
entirely.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
we
say
that
it
was
derived
from
the
totality
of
the
activities
of
general
motors
in
the
district
of
columbia.
we
say
further
that
there
is
northing
in
this
record
and
the
public
could
be
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
definitively
exactly
how
much
income
was
derived
by
general
motors
from
its
activities.
not
alone
on
sales
but
we
say
that
since
the
trade
or
business
of
general
motors
basically
in
the
district
of
columbia
is
the
merchandising
of
its
products
that
this
is
a
reasonable
method
of
determining
how
much
of
the
net
income
of
general
motors
was
attributable
to
the
district
as
a
consequence
of
its
activities.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
i
--
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
suggest
the
possibility,
i
don't
attempt
to
answer
it
unequivocally
because
i'm
not
certain
of
the
answer
that
we
would
have
to
devise
under
such
circumstance
a
different
formula
and
a
different
approach
because
carried
to
its
extreme,
the
number
of
these
apportionment
formulas
could
be
demonstrated
in
some
respect
in
order
to
be
illogical
and
inapplicable.
an
example
of
that
proof,
i
might
suggest
sir,
could
lie
in
those
areas
of
railroads
where
formulas
based
on
truck
mileage
alone
without
relation
to
activity
as
such
have
caused
some
problems
of
putting
it
a
little
differently.
and
none
of
these
matters
being
perfect,
any
one
of
them
may
at
some
point
reach
an
extreme
which
would
require
a
different
formula
or
different
determination
or
method
of
determination
of
net
incomes
of
the
tax.
i
personally
find
it
impossible
to
deal
with
hypothetical
extremes
because
i
have
no
ready
answer
for
hypothetical
extreme
which
may
well
result
in
an
improper
determination
of
net
incomes
of
the
tax.
we
don't
have
that
situation
here.
we
taxed
approximately
four-tenths
of
1%
of
a
total
of
general
motor's
net
income
and
i'd
like
to
repeat
that
that
net
income
did
not
include
sales
of
personal
property
to
the
united
states
which
property
was
not
delivered
to
the
district
of
columbia
for
use
here.
so
we
have
fragmented
that
income.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
the
tax
court
did
not
find
it
in
precise
term
sir.
the
tax
court
simply
said
that
a
portion
of
the
net
income
unidentified
which
was
taxed
by
the
district
of
columbia
had
in
turn
been
taxed
by
the
states
of
michigan,
delaware
and
maryland.
i
know
nothing
about
the
other
states
because
none
of
them
were
mentioned
and
the
general
motors
does
i
think
in
38
or
39
jurisdictions.
but
again
sir,
i
would
say
that
there's
been
no
determination
if
there
was
double
taxation
in
the
sense
which
would
require
the
district's
apportionment
formula
to
be
invalidated,
a
portion,
an
unidentified
portion
of
general
motors'
net
income
subjected
to
tax
by
other
jurisdiction.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
it's
hardly
sufficient
to
invalidate
the
district
on
that.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
it's
so
said,
yes
sir,
by
a
series
of
transactions.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
no,
i
don't
think
i
said
that
sir.
i
said
--
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
well
--
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
i
said
that
if
--
that
it
was
difficult
for
me
to
deal
with
hypothetical
extremes
such
as
the
one
which
has
been
--
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
i
don't
think
so,
sir.
i
said
--
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
no,
i
don't
think
i
said
that
sir.
i
have
to
say
simply
that
since
these
matters
are
not
perfect
if
we
in
some
manner
or
other
should
perchance
reach
an
element
of
income
which
was
outside
the
district,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
possible
to
determine
it
nor
to
ascertain
it.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
i
find
it
none
forth
to
know.
the
reason
i
find
them
none
forth
is
this.
the
record
insofar
as
double
taxation
is
concerned
or
attempt
to
demonstrate
double
taxation
is
concerned,
consists
of
tax
returns.
correct
or
incorrect,
the
record
does
not
show
and
the
tabulation
of
the
taxing
provisions
of
the
states
of
delaware,
michigan
and
maryland.
now,
by
combining
those
two
elements
or
those
two
matters,
the
statutory
provision
of
a
state
for
the
taxation
of
general
motors'
income
with
a
return
filed
by
general
motors
in
the
state,
it
is
concluded
or
at
least
argued
that
the
district
necessarily
by
its
method
overtaxed
or
doubly
taxed
the
same
income,
and
i
--
i
can't
concede
that
that
follows.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
it
is
if
you
assume
that
the
tax
return
is
filed
and
the
determinations
of
tax
liability
were
as
the
statute
so
provide
it.
you
must
have
that
assumption
first.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
i
don't
think
so
that
they
were
--
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
mr.
justice
goldberg,
the
tax
court
was
quite
clear
in
stating
that
it
would
not
receive
the
returns
as
evidence
of
their
correctness
or
their
validity
or
that
they
properly
represented
the
amount
of
taxes
involved.
there
was
no
proof
whatsoever
concerning
the
salient
features
of
the
returns
insofar
as
tax
liability
was
concerned.
in
the
tax
court
the
records
replete
with
that
sir.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
i
would
say
that
the
records
of
the
corporation
if
we
go
into
a
strict
proof
concept,
the
methods
of
the
determination
of
the
income
to
be
reported,
the
amounts
to
be
taxed.
if
that
--
if
--
if
double
taxation
was
to
be
dependent
upon
the
actions
of
other
states,
it
would
seem
that
proof,
with
proof,
positive
proof
of
the
amount
of
that
double
taxation
was
required.
mr.
justice
goldberg,
may
i
respond
to
one
matter
that
you
mentioned.
you
had
devised
a
formula
in
the
double
taxation
area
and
as
i
recall
it,
it
consisted
basically
of
the
imposition
of
a
tax
upon
all
items
manufactured
within
the
state.
by
that
method,
i
would
suppose
that
this
particular
jurisdiction
could
almost
foreclose
the
taxation
of
other
income
or
income
itself
because
the
taxing
state
to
which
you
refer
having
first
taxed,
other
jurisdictions
would
presumably
be
prohibited
from
taxing
because
by
so
doing,
it
have
introduced
the
element
of
double
taxation.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
true.
but
when
you
get
to
double
taxation,
i
think
you're
somewhat
on
a
circular
track
because
by
proceeding
from
state
to
state,
you
can
select
those
jurisdictions
which
may
validly
impose
a
tax
and
interdict
all
the
others
from
imposing
a
tax.
and
certainly,
that's
not
the
intention
of
these
several
decisions
which
the
court
has
concerned
itself
with
in
these
areas.
i
might
say
sir
again,
it
suggest
that
the
three-factor
formula
is
the
only
proper
formula
to
be
used
here.
actually,
the
petitioner
says
that
the
only
one
which
makes
economic
sense
and
should
be
applied
is
a
two-factor
formula
consisting
of
property
on
the
one
hand
and
payroll
or
labor
on
the
other.
i'm
not
an
economist.
i
have
some
difficulty
in
rationalizing
the
production
of
income
per
se
simply
by
the
employment
of
personnel
and
i
have
some
difficulty
in
rationalizing
the
production
of
income
by
the
happenstance
of
having
profit.
i'm
not
trying
to
say
that
the
three-factor
formula
or
two-factor
formula
would
be
wrong.
all
i'm
simply
trying
to
say
that
it
is
not
so
perfect
that
the
district
formula
is
necessarily
invalid
or
so
imperfect
that
it
cannot
be
applied
under
a
situation
such
as
we
have
here.
this
particular
case
is
fairly
close
to
that
ford
motor
company
versus
the
beauchamp
case.
the
tax
imposed
by
texas
in
that
case
was
measured
by
gross
receipts.
it
did
not
go
to
net
income.
it
went
to
capital
stocks,
surplus
and
undivided
profits
of
the
corporation.
but
that
was
simply
a
selection
of
elements.
underwood
typewriter,
again,
a
single
factor
formula
based
on
property
happens
to
have
the
two
kinds
of
property,
tangible,
personal
or
rather
personal
property
and
real
property.
but
apparently,
it
was
not
conceived
in
either
of
these
two
cases
that
the
apportionment
of
income
based
on
a
selection
of
a
factor
or
if
you
will
in
the
case
of
underwood,
the
two
factors
of
personal
property
and
real
property
rendered
the
apportionment
invalid
to
the
contrary
that
the
apportionment
was
held
entirely
reasonable,
has
bearing
a
relationship
to
the
activities
of
the
company
within
the
taxing
jurisdiction.
i
believe
that
an
analysis
of
the
district's
taxing
statute
clearly
demonstrates
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
congress
to
tax
income
derived
from
sales
of
personal
property
in
the
district
of
columbia.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
after
the
act
was
passed
in
1947,
the
congress
in
1948
went
to
particular
page
to
prohibit
the
district
of
columbia
from
taxing
corporations
or
incorporated
businesses
engaged
in
making
sales
of
personal
property
when
those
corporations
or
businesses
did
not
maintain
within
the
district
of
columbia
an
office
for
the
transaction
of
business.
the
congress
was
also
at
a
particular
page
to
prohibit
the
district
of
columbia
from
taxing
the
income
derived
from
sales
of
personal
property
to
the
united
states
where
the
property
was
delivered
from
places
outside,
for
use
outside
or
for
some
sources
outside.
now,
in
that
area,
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
congress
was
dealing
with
income
derived
from
sales
because
it
said
the
district
shall
not
tax
that
income
as
income
from
the
district
of
columbia
sources.
it
wasn't
talking
about
manufacturing
plans
or
payroll
expenses.
it
was
talking
about
income
derived
from
sales
of
personal
tangible
property.
thus,
the
congress'
concept
of
what
it
was
doing
here
was
that
it
was
imposing
a
tax,
there
are
many
businesses
which
would
be
subject
to
tax
but
in
this
area,
involving
sales
of
tangible
personal
property
that
it
was
imposing
a
tax
upon
the
income
derived
from
such
sale
as
a
consequence
of
the
business
activities
of
a
corporation
or
other
business
within
the
district
of
columbia.
now,
if
that
concept
that
i've
expressed
is
a
correct
one
and
in
the
district's
regulations
which
relate
to
the
taxation
or
the
determination
of
apportioned
net
income
which
is
subject
to
tax
in
the
case
of
sales
of
personal
property
is
a
reasonable
extension
of
the
district
statute.
i
can't
conceive
it
that
it
would
be
otherwise
because
of
the
extreme
portion
which
the
congress
took
in
making
determinations
concerning
what
the
district
should
tax
in
the
case
of
sales
of
personal
property
and
the
income
derived
from
such
sales.
certainly
here,
where
general
motors
have
37
millions
of
dollars
of
gross
sales
of
products
of
all
kinds
within
the
district
where
the
district
of
columbia
taxed
not
37
millions
of
dollars
but
a
portion
and
only
four-tenths
of
1%
of
the
total
net
income
of
the
corporation,
it
is
difficult,
i
think,
to
establish
over
taxation
on
the
part
of
the
district
of
columbia.
the
only
way
that
it
could
possibly
to
be
done
would
be
upon
conjecture
and
speculation.
i
may
say
also
that
general
motors
does
more
than
simply
sell
products
in
the
district
of
columbia.
it
has
many,
many
activities
within
the
district
of
columbia
which
are
related
to
its
production
facilities
and
to
its
sales
activities,
to
the
generation
of
business
in
futuro,
where
it
maintains
offices
where
which
it
does
not
maintain,
so
far
as
i'm
aware,
in
other
jurisdictions.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
on
general
motors
sir?
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
personal
property
taxes,
if
it
has
any
personal
property
here.
we
have
property
taxes
if
it
owns
any
real
property
and
i
don't
know
that
it
does.
there
would
be
possibility
of
sales
taxes
although
not
on
sales
to
dealers
for
resale
but
if
any
in
the
general
motors
buys
anything
here,
it
would
have
to
pay
a
sales
tax.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
if
it
buys
things
here
sir
such
as
pencils,
papers,
things
of
that
sort.
not
for
resale
but
for
its
own
consumption
or
use.
that
would
pretty
much
basically
be
the
types
of
taxes
that
general
motors
would
pay,
a
standard
type
or
types.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
well,
that's
what
we
have
here
sir.
it's
a
franchise
tax.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
substantially,
i'm
sorry
sir
i
missed
your
point.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
well,
if
it
had
$37
millions
of
sales
in
one
of
these
tax
years,
all
these
products
to
the
district
costumers.
now,
we
do
not
tax
$37
million
as
i
said
sir.
we
--
we
taxed
a
portion
of
the
net
income
--
total
net
income
of
general
motors
derived
from
all
of
its
activities
with
the
exception.
i
wish
to
emphasize
these
are
sales
to
the
united
states
which
specifically
under
our
statute
excluded
under
--
under
circumstances
such
as
we
have
here.
the
taxes,
so
far
as
i
know,
the
general
motors
had
paid
those
that
i
have
referred
to
and
i
would
surmise
that
the
amount
of
personal
property
taxes,
the
sales
taxes,
real
property
taxes
if
any,
i
don't
think
there
are
any
would
be
relatively
small.
i
would
surmise
it.
i
don't
know
it.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
oh
no
sir.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
no
sir,
no
sir.
this
is
a
general
statute
and
the
regulation
is
a
general
regulation.
it
applies
to
companies
such
if
i
may
mention
one
which
would
be
a
typical
one
hicks,
woodworks,
any
company
involved
generally
in
selling
personal
property
whether
through
manufacture
or
purchase.
general
motors
has
not
been
singled
out
here
for
any
special
treatment
the
application
of
the
regulation,
to
it
was
the
same
as
it
would
be
applied
to
any
corporations.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
now,
i'll
get
to
those
figures.
now,
out
of
a
total
net
income
in
1957,
the
total
net
income
of
$1,312,000,000,
the
district
apportioned
for
district
tax
purposes
five
millions
of
dollars
and
that
in
1958
out
of
a
total
of
--
total
net
income
subject
to
apportionment
of
$653
million,
the
district
apportioned
$2,700,000.
the
rated
tax
is
5%,
so
you'd
have
roughly
a
$135,000
in
1958
apportionment.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
no
sir.
i
--
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
no
sir.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
no
sir.
no
one
disagrees,
i
think,
in
respect
of
the
totality
of
the
income
subject
to
apportionment.
no
one
suggests
--
so
the
general
motors
does
not
suggest
that
its
net
income
was
not
subject
to
apportionment.
general
motors
only
says
in
effect
that
it
should
have
been
apportioned
in
such
a
manner
as
to
achieve
what
it
would
be
achieve
a
reduction
in
tax
liability
and
a
substantial
one,
about
60%
using
the
three-factor
formula
and
using
the
two-factor
formula
de
minimis,
no
tax
at
all.
mr.
henry
e.
wixon
demonstrably
unfair,
so
unfair
as
to
be
really
a
complete
denial
of
due
process
and
they
get
to
that
since
the
statute
is
considered
to
be
valid.
the
attack
must
be
upon
the
regulations.
the
attack
to
be
successful
upon
the
regulations
only
if
it's
clearly
demonstrated
either
the
regulation
is
completely
out
of
harmony
with
the
statute,
that
it
is
not
a
proper
implementation
of
it
or
that
it
was
so
applied
as
to
achieve
an
incorrect
or
improper
result.
i
believe
my
time
is
up
sir.
