mr.
donald
k.
barnes
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
associates
are
thomas
j.
hughes
of
michigan
and
william
t.
plumb
of
the
district
of
columbia.
the
problem
involved
in
this
case
is
the
geographical
attribution
or
apportionment
of
net
income
for
tax
purposes.
the
district
of
columbia
income
and
franchise
tax
act
imposes
on
corporations
carrying
on
business
within
and
without
the
districts
a
franchise
tax
measures
by
net
income
daily
attributable
to
that
portion
of
the
business
which
is
carried
on
within
the
district
and
then
the
act
directs
the
district
commissioners
to
prescribe
by
regulation
formulas
for
properly
determining
such
portion.
and
the
questions
which
that
act
and
the
regulations
under
it
raise
with
respect
to
the
assessments
made
against
the
petitioner
for
1957
and
1958
are
whether
that
statute
authorizes
the
commissioners
to
use
for
this
apportionment
purpose,
a
single
factor
of
sales
formula
that
is
attributing
to
the
district
that
portion
of
petitioner's
entire
business
net
income
from
all
sources
which
the
gross
receipts
received
from
sales
to
customers
within
the
district
thereto
total
gross
receipts
from
sales
throughout
the
world.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
can't
escape
it.
we
have
constitutional
questions
but
i
have
to
go
through
the
--
the
statutory
question
first.
we
find
--
we
believe
that
the
statute
was
violated
by
the
regulations
and
that
the
--
even
if
that
were
not
so,
then
the
regulations
produced
an
unconstitutional
result.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
not
at
all.
the
statute
is
imminently
reasonable
except
for
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
fairly
attributable
but
it
probably
should
have
itself
determined
what
was
fairly
attributable
instead
of
leaving
it
to
regulations.
that's
the
only
quarrel
of
the
statute
and
that's
not
a
constitutional
point.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
no
sir.
if
so,
that
is
if
the
statute
does
permit
that
then
the
next
question
is
whether
such
formula
is
here
applied
as
unconstitutional
and
that's
the
two
reasons,
one
is
for
attributing
to
the
district
net
income
out
of
all
reasonable
proportion
to
income
derived
from
district
activities.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
figure
shows
there's
11
times
as
much
quite
beyond
the
limits
of
due
process
and
furthermore
taxing
values
and
reaching
activities
of
someone
which
are
not
within
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
district.
and
second,
discriminating
against
interstate
commerce
by
double
taxation,
by
the
result
in
double
taxation
and
by
imposing
it
by
bargains
which
business
entirely
confines
the
district
did
not
have
to
bear.
the
facts
in
the
record
are
voluminously
set
forth
in
great
detail
but
the
essential
ones
to
the
issues
which
we
raise
here
are
these
but
the
petitioner's
business
is
primarily
the
manufacture
of
motor
vehicles,
95%
of
the
income
which
was
attributed
to
the
district
by
which
these
assessments
were
based
is
derived
from
the
manufacturer
in
the
sale
of
vehicles
and
parts
which
are
manufactured
wholly
outside
of
the
district
and
in
general
sold
outside
the
district
to
customers
located
in
the
district,
so
i
shall
not
pay
attention
to
the
evidence
weighing
the
other
5%
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument.
the
pertinent
products
are
cadillac
automobiles,
gmc
trucks
and
gmc
coaches
all
of
which
are
manufactured
entirely
in
michigan,
chevrolet
automobiles
and
trucks
which
are
assembled
in
maryland
and
buick
automobiles
and
pontiac
automobiles
which
are
assembled
in
delaware.
these
were
all
sold
through
offices
outside
the
district
insofar
as
we're
here
concerned
to
customers
within
the
district
generally
independent
retail
dealers.
they
set
all
the
manufacturing
and
most
of
the
selling
activity
occurred
outside
the
district
but
they
were
related
in
district
activities.
and
they
were
permins
--
principally
sales
promotion
work
by
traveling
representatives
having
both
their
offices
and
their
residences
outside
the
district.
in
1957,
one
of
the
two
years
here,
the
payroll
for
the
time
spent
by
these
people
in
the
district
was
$65,000
for
which
the
district
attributes
income
for
$5,166,000,
its
net
income
and
the
tax
of
$258,000.
the
figures
are
the
same
order
for
the
next
year.
there
are
offices
in
the
district
which
are
not
directly
related
to
the
sales
of
these
automobiles
and
their
presence
in
the
district
had
no
bearing
on
the
assessments.
it
wasn't
considered
in
any
way
by
the
finance
officer
in
making
his
computations.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
the
statute
as
i
told
mr.
justice
harlan
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
yes,
i
can't
escape
the
statutory
question
because
it
leads
up
to
the
constitutional
questions.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
the
same
thing
which
causes
the
assessments
to
violate
the
constitution
is
in
the
first
instance,
a
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
as
i
said,
this
is
unrelated
offices
in
the
district
had
no
bearing
at
all
on
the
assessments
made
by
the
finance
officer
but
they
were
considered
by
the
tax
court
in
its
computations
and
their
activities
are
reflected
in
those.
now,
the
petitioner
paid
the
tax
under
protest
and
sued
for
refund
in
the
tax
court
and
then
the
tax
court
expert
economic
testimony
was
brought
in
to
show
the
geographical
sources
of
income
that
is
whether
the
activities
occur
and
the
property
exist
which
are
in
the
income
and
expert
economy
testimony
to
show
how
to
measure
the
contribution
of
each
of
those
productive
sources
on
the
interstate,
on
the
double
taxation
question
returns
were
introduced
which
showed
the
amounts
and
the
bases
for
taxes
paid
to
the
states
where
the
cars
were
manufactured.
now,
the
tax
court
based
on
all
of
that
found
those
facts
and
i'm
reading
from
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
page
3a
where
the
tax
court's
opinion
is
reproduced.
the
segment
of
the
petitioner's
business
which
was
conducted
both
within
and
without
the
district
of
columbia
consisted
of
a
manufacture
of
a
certain
number
of
automobiles
and
kindred
products
without
the
district
and
the
sale
thereof
to
customers
within
the
district.
that
net
income
from
this
segment
of
petitioner's
business
was
earned
by
a
series
of
transactions
beginning
with
the
manufacturer
products
in
several
states
and
ending
with
sale
to
the
customers
in
the
district.
while
the
net
income
was
not
realized
until
sale,
it
was
earned
in
part
by
manufacturer
of
the
product
sold
including
in
addition
to
actual
manufacture,
procurement
of
material,
financing,
use
of
property
and
administration.
in
continuing,
the
method
used
by
the
assessing
authority
of
the
district
attributed
to
the
district
100%
of
the
net
income
derived
by
the
petitioner
from
that
segment
of
his
business
which
consisted
the
manufacturer
without
and
the
sale
of
products
within
the
district.
the
percentage
as
determined
was
out
of
all
reasonable
proportion
to
the
trade
or
business
carried
on
or
engaged
in
by
a
petitioner
with
the
--
within
the
district.
and
one
more,
finding
three
covers
the
amounts
of
tax
paid
to
maryland,
delaware
and
michigan
and
then
continues
apportionment
of
net
income
of
petitioner
derived
from
the
segment
of
the
petitioner's
business
consisting
of
the
manufacture
of
products
without
and
sale
within
the
district
of
columbia
was
taxed
by
the
above
mentioned
states
pursuant
to
apportionment
formulas
with
factors
or
property,
payroll
and
sales
as
provided
by
their
laws.
the
tax
court
then
reach
this
conclusion
of
law
which
was
that
the
assessments
were
not
authorized
by
the
statute
because
it's
not
complying
with
the
requirement
that
--
of
the
statute.
the
income
from
the
business
conducted
within
and
without
the
district
be
deemed
to
be
from
sources
within
and
without
the
district
and
apportioned
accordingly.
having
thus
found
that
the
single
factor
sales
formula
was
invalid
and
that
being
the
only
one
supplied
in
the
regulations,
the
tax
court
then
as
it
is
permitted
to
do
being
an
administrative
party
applied
a
--
its
own
formula
which
was
the
familiar
three-factor
property
--
formula
of
property,
payroll
and
sales
as
used
in
so
many
states.
the
effect
was
to
reduce
the
tax
for
1957
from
$258,000
to
a
$101,000
and
--
or
refund
was
ordered
to
the
difference
in
the
figures
$258,000
with
the
same
order.
the
tax
court
did
not
consider
the
constitutional
questions.
a
division
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
affirmed
two
to
one
on
the
opinion
below.
in
rehearing
en
banc,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
five
to
four
so
we
have
an
even
split
among
the
judges
who
so
far
heard
the
case,
five
upholding
the
assessments
and
five
declaring
them
and
the
regulations
invalid.
now,
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
since
the
assessments
did
not
include
income
from
business
conducted
entirely
outside
the
district
having
no
connection
with
it,
the
income
of
the
petitioner
was
apportioned
which
was
all
that
the
statute
require.
and
though
they
suggest
that
the
tax
court's
formula
might
be
better,
they
said
that
it
wouldn't
be
forced
on
the
commission.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
finding
that
a
100%
of
the
income
from
business
done
within
and
without
the
district
had
been
attributed
to
the
district
was
irrelevant.
and
hence
the
finding
that
such
attribution
was
out
of
all
reasonable
proportion
had
no
factual
basis
and
that
double
taxation
has
not
been
proved.
now,
the
central
error
in
the
court
of
appeals'
reasoning
here
is
holding
irrelevant
the
fact
that
the
application
of
these
gross
receipts
fraction
miss
--
segregates
the
amount
of
income
which
is
derived
from
the
only
business
with
which
the
district
has
any
connection
that
is
that
part
of
the
total
business
which
is
conducted
partly
within
and
partly
without
the
district
and
having
recognized
that
as
the
amount
of
income
to
that
sec
--
of
the
segment,
taxing
a
100%
of
it.
they
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
was
irrelevant
not
that
it
didn't
happen
but
it
was
irrelevant.
that
fact
though
is
the
fact
or
those
facts
which
establish
that
the
formula
as
used
by
the
district
and
the
assessments
made
by
the
district
did
not
comply
with
the
statute
requiring
income
to
be
deemed
to
be
from
sources
within
and
without
and
apportioned
accordingly.
and
those
facts
are
the
ones
which
established
that
there
was
taxation
of
a
much
greater
share
of
the
petitioner's
income
and
arose
within
the
district.
and
also
those
facts
are
the
ones
which
established
double
taxation
and
that
the
fault
of
double
taxation
was
of
the
district
and
not
the
other
states.
identifying
the
segment
income
does
not
apportion
anything.
the
experts
pointed
this
out
without
dissent.
they
said
that
the
district's
formula
finds
100%
of
the
income
from
all
business
culminating
in
sales
to
district
customers.
the
formula
deems
all
such
income
to
be
from
district
sources
and
does
not
as
required
by
statute,
deem
it
to
be
from
sources
within
and
without.
now,
that
this
kind
of
a
calculation
reaches
a
100%
of
such
income
as
obvious
and
it's
well
illustrated
in
the
tax
court's
opinion
by
the
hypothetical
case
of
a
manufacturer
--
manufacturing
entirely
of
maryland
and
selling
entirely
to
customers
in
the
district,
obviously
would
be
taxed
under
this
formula
on
a
100%
of
it's
entire
income
from
all
the
world
and
that
is
not
apportionment.
it
makes
no
difference
that
in
the
case
of
this
petitioner,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
business
consisting
of
the
manufacture
of
automobiles
in
michigan
and
selling
them
to
the
customers
in
california
is
completely
beyond
the
concern,
that
the
district
is
concerned
only
with
the
cars
which
are
manufactured
somewhere
maryland,
delaware,
michigan
and
sold
to
customers
within
the
district.
the
fact
that
it
may
not
tax
those
california
transactions,
there's
no
authority
for
it
to
tax
a
100%
of
apportions,
which
is
related
in
a
small
way
to
the
district
of
columbia.
paraphrasing
underwood
typewriter
company
against
chamberlain
which
was
the
first
case
in
which
this
court
considered
an
income
tax
apportionment
formula,
the
tax
court
found
that
the
income
here
involved
was
earned
by
a
series
of
transactions
beginning
with
manufacturing
and
procurement
and
management
all
of
which
occurred
in
other
states
and
ending
with
a
sale
with
the
customers
in
the
district.
alright,
the
finding
was
correct,
in
fact
as
established
by
the
experts
we
brought
that
income
has
its
source
in
capital
and
labor
and
it's
correct
in
law
as
established
by
this
court
and
often
repeated
that
income
is
again
derived
from
capital,
labor
or
both
combined.
and
there,
it
is
the
contrast
between
this
case
and
general
motors
corporation
against
washington
where
we
were
be
talking
about
a
gross
receipts
tax
which
was
related
to
activities
carried
on
within
the
district
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
sources
of
net
income
which
is
the
problem
here.
there
the
--
it
was
a
question
of
relating
activities
to
sales.
here,
the
question
is
relating
activities
to
net
income.
there
are
some
activities
in
the
district,
the
tax
court
well
measured
them
but
the
great
majority
of
the
activities
were
outside
the
district
throughout.
now,
when
the
income
is
apportioned
on
the
basis
of
the
employment
of
capital
and
labor
within
and
without
the
district,
the
amount
of
such
income,
this
is
gross
and
of
net
income
would
be
$466,000
in
the
district
for
1957
and
$254,000
for
1958
and
that's
about
one-eleventh
of
the
amount
that
was
assessed.
it
has
to
reach
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
they
would
be
tax
born
of
the
washington
decision.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
the
gross
receipts
tax
--
remember
the
general
motors
corporation
against
washington
didn't
change
any
constitutional
principles.
what
it
did
was
to
extend
the
definition
of
activities
which
are
sufficient
to
the
service
of
measure
for
that
kind
of
tax.
but
the
constitutional
distinction
between
our
gross
receipts
tax
levied
with
respect
to
activities
in
the
taxing
jurisdiction
and
what
the
measure
must
be
on
the
one
hand
and
the
sources
of
net
income
which
is
all
that
the
net
income
--
which
is
the
governing
requirement
for
net
income
tax
were
constitutionally
very
different
things.
in
that
case,
we're
looking
for
an
activity
which
was
sufficient
to
allow
the
tax
to
be
imposed
and
the
measure
was
irrelevant.
here,
we
are
looking
for
the
sources
of
the
net
income,
the
net
income
which
--
and
this
constitutional
as
well
as
statutory,
which
is
fairly
attributable
to
the
activities
carried
on
within
the
district
or
the
statute
says
the
business
done
or
the
commercial
activity.
so
that
all
the
cases
which
i
have
considered
apportionment
or
have
or
even
indirectly
there
had
been
only
three
or
four
that
are
directly
considered
have
recognized
that
the
income
--
net
income
now
must
be
apportioned
to
its
sources.
that
is
the
fundamental
difference
between
this
type
of
tax
and
the
gross
receipts
tax.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
any
connection
between
them?
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
oh
no,
i
--
i
don't
see
any
inconsistencies
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that's
right.
and
it's
--
it
has
a
--
that
type
of
tax
has
a
different
constitutional
history.
it
depends
upon
different
test.
the
test
there
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that
just
goes
to
rates,
this
is
5%
and
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
no,
it
was
three-tenths
of
1%.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that's
right.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that's
correct.
i
thought
there
was
one
there
but
i'm
sure
there's
one
here.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
i'm
sure
there's
one
here.
now,
as
i
mentioned,
the
amount
of
income
that
was
attributed
by
the
district
to
the
district
was
11
times
or
would
have
been
attributed
if
you
measured
the
activities
on
the
district.
now,
hans
rees',
a
north
california
case
of
some
time
ago,
this
court
found
that
four-and-a-half
times
that
is
attributing
to
the
state,
four-and-a-half
times
the
income
which
hans
rees'
showed
had
a
reason
there,
was
out
of
all
reasonable
portion
to
what
it
should
have
been
and
the
state
was
told
they
couldn't
tax
that
much.
now,
this
case
is
more
than
twice
as
bad
as
that
one.
on
the
point
of
double
taxation,
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
hadn't
been
proved
because
we
use
a
hypothetical
illustration
in
our
brief.
the
dissent
in
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
evidence
overwhelmingly
sustained
the
findings
of
the
tax
court
one
in
which
was
that
a
portion
of
the
same
income
which
was
taxed
100%
by
the
district
had
been
properly
taxed
by
michigan,
maryland,
and
delaware.
now,
it's
obvious
that
the
double
taxation
occurred
in
fact
because
if
the
state
of
manufacture
basis
their
tax
on
manufacturing
activities
as
michigan,
maryland
and
delaware
do,
the
state
and
the
stay
to
the
situs
of
the
customer
attributes
all
income
arising
from
those
activities
to
the
situs
of
the
customer
as
the
district
does.
the
same
income
inevitably
is
being
taxed
twice
and
this
is
not
a
mere
minor
overlap
that
occurs
because
of
the
differences
of
opinion
as
to
exactly
how
detail
should
be
worked
up
where
but
is
a
fundamental
conflict.
the
evidence
considered
by
the
tax
court
on
that
point
was
the
statutes
of
the
involved
states,
the
tax
returns,
receipt
showing
payment
and
there
is
--
and
the
tax
return
showed
also
the
exact
basis
on
which
the
tax
was
computed
for
each
of
those
states
and
showed
that
a
portion
of
the
income
from
every
car
made
in
those
states
and
sold
to
the
customers
in
the
district
was
taxing
those
states.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
the
--
each
--
each
of
those
three
states
equally
weighs
the
fractions
of
property
payroll
and
sales
within
the
state
but
it
doesn't
workout
to
exactly
two-thirds
in
anyone
case
because
the
factors
within
the
state
vary.
thus,
we
might
have
a
higher
percentage
of
property
than
we
do
of
sales
in
a
given
state.
they're
not
completely
uniform.
so
the
principle
is
two-thirds
but
the
actual
figures
which
are
shown
on
those
returns
before
the
tax
court
are
not
two-thirds.
they
vary
because
of
that
--
of
that
consideration.
now,
the
formulas
which
were
used
by
these
other
states,
property
payroll
and
sales
are
valid.
and
that
they're
sound
in
fact
because
they
attribute
at
least
two-thirds
of
the
income
to
its
source
and
they're
signing
law
because
it
was
repeatedly
approved
by
this
court.
hence,
this
double
taxation
is
the
exclusive
form
of
the
formula
employed
by
the
--
by
the
district
financial
officer.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
i
don't
know.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
the
--
the
basis
--
the
basis
were
computing
that
here
is
in
the
record
but
--
but
i
know
what
it
is.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
$5,166,000
is
the
total
net
income
derived
in
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
net
income,
derived
from
the
sales
of
--
oh,
i
remember
the
figure,
it
was
$37
million,
it
was
the
total
sales.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
and
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
i
--
i
have
to
--
i'm
not
quick
enough
to
multiply
that
by
three-tenths
of
1%
to
find
the
answer.
now,
the
district
in
its
brief
and
so
on
points
to
single
factor
formula
for
apportionment
purposes
which
had
been
permitted
to
stand
in
other
cases.
they
were
all
formula
which
tended
in
some
way
to
measure
local
activity
as
an
income
source
and
they
all
work
some
apportionment.
the
single
factor
destination
sales
formula
we
have
here
does
not
apportion
at
all.
any
of
those
other
formula,
if
applied
here
would
assign
almost
no
income
to
the
district
as
the
tabulation
on
page
57a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief
shows.
what
that
means
is
that
the
single
factor
formula
not
that
we
contend
for
those
that
were
upheld
in
those
other
cases,
can
be
no
authority
whatever
in
support
of
the
single
factor
formula
in
this
case.
and
the
question
impacted
the
decision,
the
finance
officer
some
time
ago
recommended
to
the
commissions
that
they
adopt
the
three-factor
formula
said
that
it
wouldn't
reduce
the
district
income
very
much
because
what
they
lost
were
mostly
picked
up
from
local
business
and
also
because
they
were
seized
to
drive
offices,
business
offices
out
of
the
district.
when
we
come
to
other
jurisdictions
however,
the
impact
can
be
tremendous.
there's
an
enormous
temptation
that
the
jurisdiction
permitted
to
do
so
to
arrange
its
tax
so
as
to
fall
on
the
foreigner
and
not
on
the
voting
resident.
an
attempt
to
do
that
would
have
very
serious
consequences
in
upsetting
the
now
well-established
generally
used
division
of
income
which,
while
it
has
a
variations
in
detail
works
always
to
apportion
something
to
the
sources
of
income
of
the
manufacturer
as
the
place
where
it
goes
to
the
manufacturing.
may
i
reserve
a
few
minutes?
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
want
now
to
supply
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question.
the
arithmetic
has
been
done
for
me.
the
washington
tax,
if
applied
here
in
the
district
of
columbia,
would
produce
for
1957
a
revenue
for
the
district
of
a
$111,000.
that
compares
with
a
$101,000
which
is
the
amount
determined
by
the
tax
court
using
the
three-factor
formula,
with
$258,000
as
assessed
by
the
district
and
with
$23,000
if
it
were
computed
the
way
the
economist
said
it
should
be.
that's
the
two-factor
formula
meeting
sales
altogether.
we,
by
the
way,
asked
for
the
three-factor
formula
and
had
no
objection
to
it
anytime.
commerce
clause
of
course
binds
the
district
commissioners
so
we're
not
concerned
what
the
congress
did.
and
the
congress
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
i
said
that
the
commerce
clause
binds
the
district
commissioners
though
not
the
congress
that
is
the
freedom
that
the
congress
has
to
deal
with
interstate
commerce,
this
court
has
held
it
cannot
be
delegated
to
the
local
legislative
body
within
the
district.
so
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
yes.
but
we're
not
quarrelling
here
what
the
congress
did.
we're
quarreling
only
with
what
the
commissioners
did.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
think
the
congressional
statute
is
commendable
but
is
very
fully
carried
out.
the
amount
of
double
taxation
is
irrelevant
and
as
for
these
unrelated
officers
in
the
district
about
which
you
inquired
mr.
justice
goldberg,
one
of
the
infirmities
in
this
regulations,
one
of
the
things
we
pointed
out
in
our
briefs
is
that
while
they're
here,
we
have
over
a
million
dollars
of
payroll
within
the
district
and
related
rented
office
space
and
so
on,
the
district
assessments
don't
take
that
into
consideration
in
anyway.
the
tax
court's
determination
does.
the
district's
assessments
take
into
consideration
just
one
thing.
that's
where
the
customer
is
located
and
they
make
the
assessments
progressed
not
to
any
degree
upon
activities
within
or
without
the
district
or
anywhere
else.
and
was
--
in
response
to
questioning,
mr.
wixon
was
--
have
expressed
difficulty
in
dealing
with
an
extreme
situation,
i
want
to
close
by
submitting
again
that
this
situation
is
just
extreme
as
the
one
that
--
that
the
tax
court
used
in
illustration
in
its
opinion.
that
is
our
situation
is
exactly
the
same
as
if
we've
manufactured
entirely
in
maryland,
sold
entirely
in
the
district
and
the
district
taxed
to
a
100%
of
the
entire
net
income.
here,
what
they
have
done
is
to
tax
100%
of
the
entire
income
derived
from
that
segment
of
the
business
which
consists
of
manufacturing
outside
and
selling
within
and
the
fact
that
only
four-tenths
of
1%
of
our
sales
are
made
to
district
customers
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case.
that
comparison
is
completely
insignificant.
the
fact
is
that
out
of
those
sales
to
district
customers,
the
manufacture
of
the
products
we
derived
$5
million
worth
of
income.
that
is
the
income
that
the
district
is
taxed
in
both
the
statute
and
the
constitution
requires
some
of
that
as
the
tax
court
did
to
be
attributed
to
the
manufacturing
activities
of
maryland,
michigan
and
elsewhere.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
was
irrelevant.
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
no.
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
justice
white.
the
court
of
appeals
--
that's
on
the
double
taxation
point.
the
court
of
appeals
simply
said,
the
taxpayer
has
not
proved
double
taxation
but
relies
merely
on
a
hypothetical
example
--
mr.
donald
k.
barnes
they
did
not
and
the
--
and
the
finding
was
never
challenged
any
--
at
any
point.
