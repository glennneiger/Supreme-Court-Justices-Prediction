you
agree

is
another
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
washington
case
outside
of
the
nature
of
the
tax.
is
there
not
here
--
there
is
a
double
taxation
problem
involved
which
supported
washington
and
you
said
it
was
not
present,
isn't
that
correct?

of
the
district
of
columbia
(inaudible)
that
will
be
an
inevitable
conclusion
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
perhaps
will
you
assume
that
tax
court
there
was
wrong?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
what
more
do
you
think
this
is
introduced.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
assume
firstly
like
the
last
stage,
it
was
subject
to
the
description
that
it
must
be
fairly
apportioned.
