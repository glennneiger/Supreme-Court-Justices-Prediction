justice
potter
stewart
how
--
how
does
this
case
differ.
i
understand
that
it's
complicated
in
because
of
the
pleadings
and
because
there
are
several
parties
for
the
cross-claims
--
but
is
there
any
difference
here
basically
between
this
case
and
an
ordinary
case
in
which
a
plaintiff
has
sued
a
defendant
and
then
asked
for
a
medical
examination
of
that
defendant?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
that
facts
are
more
complicated
but
is
there
ultimately
any
difference
in
the
application
of
rule
35?
justice
potter
stewart
the
district
judge
didn't
exercised
the
--
apparently
exercised
a
little
discretion
in
granting
this
but
he
didn't
even
read
your
petition
and
are
--
read
it
understandingly
because
he
granted
a
good
deal
more
than
you
asked
for,
didn't
he?
he
granted
nine
examinations
instead
of
four.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you're
suggesting
i
suppose
in
effect
that
we
now
have
before
us
because
of
these
chain
of
circumstances
a
different
case
from
the
case
in
which
we
originally
granted
certiorari?
