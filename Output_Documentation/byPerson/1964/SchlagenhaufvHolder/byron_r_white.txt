justice
byron

white
well
let's
assume
that
he
had
had
the
opportunity
to
--
and
had
denied
that
he
had
bad
eyesight
and
then
the
court
ordered
the
examination.
would
rule
35
--
well
you
would
sustain
that
action
in
35.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
i
realize
your
good
cause
is
probably
another
point
down
the
line
somewhere
but
as
this
would
eliminate
your
present
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
schlagenhauf
had
denied
--
denied
in
the
court
and
the
court
had
ordered
the
examination,
this
point
would
wash
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
think
you
should
have
--
is
this
really
a
substantial
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
know
â€“
how
would
you
deny
or
what
do
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
would
he
admit
it
and
let's
assume
the
--
that
mo
--
the
complaint
was
filed
under
the
alleged
that
schlagenhauf
had
bad
eyesight.
you
say
he
should
have
an
opportunity
to
answer
that.
now
what
would
--
do
you
have
any
idea
of
what
would
happen,
whether
he
deny
it
or
affirm
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
he
--
he
said
it
would
--
he
said
it
would,
except
that
then
he
gives
another
point
of
that
cause.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
and
now
you're
speaking
of
the
petitioner,
contract
carrier
as
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
not
national
lead.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
also
they
joined
the
same
petition.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
records
shows?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
of
any
[inaudible]
where
the
--
where
the
examination
is
sought
to
prove
negligence
rather
than
injury.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
court,
this
present
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
the
difference
between
this
and
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
not
along
this
line.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
along
this
line.
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
ever
used
the
rules
to
get
the
physical
examination
--
get
the
physical
examination
of
the
party
to
prove
that
he
was
negligent?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
that
was
a
constitutional
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
going
back
to
the
physical
examinations
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
make
the
--
do
you
still
would
make
any
point
out
of
the
nine
examinations
instead
of
four
or
that
is
washed
out
of
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
is
no
issue
remaining,
actually
there's
no
practical
issue
remaining
between
you
as
far
as
being
nine
rather
than
the
four
examinations?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
were
only
four
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
order
has
been
modified.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
prove
negligence.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
you're
really
saying,
to
prove
negligence.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
have
the
same
problem
getting
an
examination
of
the
plaintiff
through
the
contributory
negligence.
