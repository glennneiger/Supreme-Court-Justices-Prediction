justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
joint
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
has
to
be
an
issue
joined
on
the
matter
of
his
mental
and
physical
health.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
tell
me
mr.
smith
that
if
at
least
to
the
national
lead
cross-claim
was
there
an
answer
of
any
kind
filed
on
behalf
its
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
was
the
allegation
that
--
that
his
vision
was
bad
is
that
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
national
lead.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
--
why
is
this
--
there's
no
answer
in
the
file?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
don't
understand
that
he
was
made
a
party
by
--
i
can't
find
the
pleading
here
--
by
national
lead.
it
must
have
alleged
something
against
him,
did
it,
bad
vision
or
something?
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand.
didn't
he
have
enough
opportunity
to
answer
that
allegation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
would
that
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that
happens
then
was
the
application
under
your
own
premise
under
rule
35,
this
is
about
this
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
guess
to
the
point
of
good
cause
and
notice.
there
of
course,
there
is
a
question
of
invasion
of
privacy
which
i
wouldn't
go
into
at
this
time.
i
am
afraid
i
have
used
--
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
i
will
reserve
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
have
the
judges
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
understand
that
if
in
fact
this
petitioner
had
filed
an
answer
to
the
national
lead
cross-claim
denying
the
allegation
of
that
cross-claim
that
this
accident
was
due
to
his
defective
vision
or
whatever
that
allegation
was.
now
that
he
would
not
be
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
what's
left?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
i
--
i
understand
that
argument,
that
--
that's
not
to
say
then
that
it
did
not
be
powered
to
make
the
order
in
the
case
i
put
you,
you
answered
and
denied
the
allegation
of
the
cross-claim,
but
only
that
the
premise
upon
which
so
orders
this
issue
namely
good
cause
is
not
missed
out.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
other
ground?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
you
mean
to
prove
negligence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
that
it's
only
examinations
submitted
only
on
the
issue
of
damages.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
anything
in
the
wording
of
the
rule
itself
would
justify
that
distinction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
would
you
support
it?
