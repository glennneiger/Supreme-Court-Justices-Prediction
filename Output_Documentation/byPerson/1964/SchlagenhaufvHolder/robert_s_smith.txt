mr.
robert
s.
smith
if
the
court
please,
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
am
here
pinch-heading
for
mr.
wilbert
mcinerney
of
the
washington
bar
whose
name
is
on
the
schedule.
we
were
in
mr.
mcinerney's
office
at
nine
o'clock
this
morning
calling
a
cab
and
he
got
word
that
his
wife
had
died.
he
of
course
left
immediately
for
the
hospital.
i'm
pinch-heading
for
him
and
i
trust
i
can
cover
the
ground.
this
case
arose
in
indiana
as
a
result
of
an
automobile
accident,
i
shouldn't
say
automobile,
involving
a
greyhound
bus
being
driven
by
the
petitioner
here,
robert
schlagenhauf
and
a
tractor
trailer,
the
tractor
being
owned
by
the
--
one
of
the
respon
--
not
a
respondent,
one
of
the
parties
contract
carriers,
the
trailer
being
owned
by
national
lead
comp
--
corporation.
it
was
being
driven
by
mccorkhill.
that
accident
happened
on
july
13th,
1962
on
highway
40,
some
miles
west
of
indianapolis.
shortly
thereafter,
personal
injury
litigation
was
filed,
as
a
mater
of
fact
four
days
or
after,
and
asking
for
very
substantial
amounts
of
money
from
all
of
the
parties
i
have
named.
in
november
of
1962,
the
plaintiffs,
markowitz
being
her
name,
filed
an
amended
complaint.
and
in
that
amended
complaint,
no
mention
was
made
of
the
physical
or
mental
condition
of
the
petitioner
schlagenhauf.
greyhound
filed
an
amended
cross-claim
asking
that
general
motors
be
made
a
third
party
defendant
asking
judgment
on
its
cross-claim
against
contract
carriers,
national
lead
and
general
motors.
contract
then
filed
its
answer
to
the
cross-claim
of
greyhound.
again,
no
mention
was
ever
made
of
schlagenhauf's
physical
or
mental
condition.
later,
in
a
letter
to
the
district
court,
contract
carriers
alleged
specific
acts
of
negligence
on
the
part
of
greyhound
saying
the
defendant
the
greyhound
corporation
carelessly
and
negligently
employed
and
caused
its
driver
robert
l.
schlagenhauf
to
operate
the
said
bus
upon
a
public
highway
although
he
said
robert
l.
schlagenhauf
was
not
mentally
or
physically
capable
of
operating
the
said
bus
upon
a
public
highway
at
the
time
and
place
when
said
accident
occurred,
which
fact
was
known
or
should
have
been
known
to
the
greyhound
corporation.
the
whole
question
involved
in
this
case
is
an
interpretation
of
rule
35,
the
rule
permitting
physical
exam
and
mental
examination
of
a
party.
rule
35
of
course
provides
in
an
action
in
which
the
--
the
mental
or
physical
condition
of
a
party
is
in
controversy,
the
court
in
which
the
action
is
pending
may
order
him
to
submit
to
a
physical
or
mental
examination
by
a
physician.
the
order
maybe
made
only
on
motion
for
good
cause
show
and
upon
noticed
--
upon
notice
to
the
party
to
be
examined
and
to
all
other
parties
and
shall
specify
the
time,
place,
matter
of
conditions
and
scope
of
the
examination,
and
the
person
or
persons
by
whom
it
is
to
be
made.
about
this
time
in
the
proceedings,
a
petition
was
filed
in
the
district
court
by
contract
carriers
asking
that
schlagenhauf
submit
to
physical
and
mental
examinations.
now
it
has
to
be
remembered
that
schlagenhauf
is
the
unwilling
dependent
driver
of
the
greyhound
bus.
i
believe
both
mr.
kightlinger
and
i
can
agree
that
there
has
never
been
an
interpretation
of
the
rule
as
it
applies
to
an
unwilling
defendant
as
of
this
court
before.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
sir?
mr.
robert
s.
smith
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
the
rule
says,
a
party.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
uh
--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
a
plaintiff
suing
a
defendant
and
asking
for
a
physical
examination?
i
know
of
no
cases
where
it's
been
done
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
he
was
not
--
he
was
not
a
party.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
he
was
only
a
party
in
so
far
as
the
plaintiffs
markowitz
were
concerned
–
mr.
robert
s.
smith
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
that
is
correct,
that's
correct
statement.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
it
is
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact
schlagenhauf's
physical
or
mental
condition
was
never
up
to
this
date
put
in
controversy.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i
meet
that
your
honor
by
pointing
out
that
rule
35
provides
for
the
mental
or
physical
condition
of
a
party
is
in
controversy.
now,
we
--
we
--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
national
lead
simply
filed
a
statement.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
no,
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
a
defendant
such
as
schlagenhauf
should
be
subjected
to
a
physical
or
mental
examination.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
[inaudible]
refers
to
a
party
of
plaintiff.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
no,
i
--
you
didn't
say
that
your
honor.
i
can
--
i
can
readily
see
where
there
should
be
an
examination
of
a
defendant
under
certain
circumstances.
for
instance,
suppose
an
individual
buys
a
policy
of
life
insurance
and
falsifies
the
application
by
saying
that
he
has
not
had
certain
diseases
and
the
company
learns
that
he
does
have
them
and
that
they
may
prove
fatal
very
shortly.
that
company
certainly
is
entitled
to
file
an
action,
a
declaratory
judgment
action
for
cancellation
of
that
policy
and
if
that
man,
the
defendant
in
that
case
places
the
issue
in
controversy
by
denying
that
he
had
those
conditions
then
i
believe
the
court
should
and
would
order
a
physical
examination
of
the
individual
but
the
respondent
here
or
the
petitioner
pardon
me,
was
never
given
any
opportunity
too
put
this
issue
in
controversy
as
is
required
by
rule
35.
the
court
was
presented
with
a
petition
asking
that
he'd
be
examined
by
four
doctors
based
simply
on
the
statement
of
a
lawyer
that
schlagenhauf
had
had
a
similar
accident
in
the
past,
it
doesn't
say
how
far
in
the
past.
that
is
the
only
cause
shown
and
the
court
signed
an
order
ordering
schlagenhauf
to
submit
to
examination
by
nine
physicians
the
same
day
the
petition
was
submitted.
neither
schlagenhauf
nor
we
knew
anything
about
this
petition
until
the
petition
and
the
order
signed
by
the
court
was
received.
now,
the
lawyer
attorney
provides
for
notice
and
neither
schlagenhauf
nor
we
were
given
any
notice
whatever.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
contract
carriers
filed
the
first
two
your
honor.
national
lead
follows
it.
but
national
lead
filed
their
cross-claim
before
they
filed
--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
they
filed
it
after
contract
carriers
had.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i
believe
both
of
their
petitions
are
practically
identical
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
he
was
not
a
party
to
contract
carriers.
my
point
is
it
boils
down
very
much
to
this
that
rule
35,
when
the
physical
or
mental
condition
of
a
party
is
in
controversy,
now
it
is
my
contention
that
a
matter
cannot
be
put
in
controversy
until
an
allegation
is
made
by
one
party
and
denied
by
another
party.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
no
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
that
his
vision
was
bad.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
that's
correct
and
that
he
was
sleepy.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
and
that
he
was
sleepy.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
sir,
greyhound,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
he
was
their
agent.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
sir?
mr.
robert
s.
smith
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
and
--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
-
and
upon
the
showing
of
good
cause.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
that
is
my
contention.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
he
was
given
--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
he
was
given
no
opportunity
to
admit,
deny,
stand
mute,
or
anything
else.
the
petition
with
the
bare
allegation
that
he
had
been
involved
in
a
prior
accident
was
filed
--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
no
sir,
he
did
not.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i
--
i
would,
if
he
denied
it
and
--
i
still
don't
think
that
would
be
a
good
cause
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
yes
sir,
it
would.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
this
particular
point,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
it
is
a
very
substantial
question.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
yes
it
is.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i
can't
answer
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
my
assumption
is
he
would
deny
it.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
that
is
correct.
the
petition
was
presented
to
the
court
and
the
court
signed
the
order
which
accompanied
the
petition
the
same
afternoon.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
along
with
the
copy
of
the
order
signed
by
the
court.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
did
schlagenhauf
--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
no
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
the
difference
is
your
honor
--
the
interpretation
of
rule
35.
now,
with
interrogatories,
you
have
the
opportunity
of
objecting
to
them,
submitting
them
to
the
court.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
no
sir,
he
did
not.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
because
they
objected
to
the
invasion
of
privacy
of
an
individual
by
doctors
had
set
out
in
the
botsford
case
which
of
course
arose
before
rule
35.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
in
a
personal
--
and
the
reaction
they
(voice
overlap)
the
plaintiff
voluntarily
--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
there
is
an
issue
drawn
when
the
answers
are
filed.
if
--
if
the
--
if
certain
things
are
denying
it.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
the
answer
to
that
--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
the
answer
to
that
your
honor
is
a
practical
reason
and
not
a
legal.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
judge
holder
was
leaving
the
afternoon
as
the
order
was
signed
to
hold
the
court
in
evansville,
indiana
and
he
did
leave
and
had
gone
before
we
received
either
a
copy
of
the
petition
or
a
copy
of
the
order.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
we
could
go
on,
and
then
bounding
--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
through
evansville,
let's
see,
about
170
miles
–
i
believe
it's
about
a170
miles
--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
yeah,
i
know,
i
can't
say
whether
--
there
are
two
other
federal
judges.
now
i
can't
say
whether
they
were
present
in
indianapolis
on
that
particular
day
or
not.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i
have
few
moments
left
i
don't
know
how
many.
i
was
interested
in
mr.
kightlinger's
comments
about
the
growing
tendency
or
say
to
authorized
invasion
of
the
privacy
of
the
individual.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
sure
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
no,
i
don't
say
that
your
honor.
i
say
that
that
would
eliminate
the
one
point,
the
in
controversy
point.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
what
is
left
--
the
order
maybe
made
only
on
motion
for
good
cause
show.
now
this
order
was
made
on
a
motion
alleging
that
schlaugenhauf
had
been
involved
in
a
similar
accident
at
sometime
in
the
past.
that
motion
does
not
say
that
any
physical
or
mental
defects
that
schlagenhauf
might
have
were
the
approximate
cause
of
this
accident
whether
a
remote
cause
or
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i
don't
believe
that
it's
our
contention.
as
we
point
out
in
the
brief
that
rule
35
contemplates
the
physical
or
mental
examination
of
the
defendant
in
this
type
of
case
--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i
would
say
so
yes
your
honor
and
the
life
insurance
case
that
i
cited
earlier
--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
no,
no.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
nothing
in
the
wording
--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
because
i
believe
that
using
the
other
interpretation
it
violate
several
sections
of
the
constitution
which
we
set
out
in
our
brief
that
it
certainly
--
well,
they
all
boil
down
to
invasion
of
the
individual's
right
to
privacy.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
it
is
not
washed
out
your
honor.
as
i
understand
it
this
court
is
considering
this
case
on
the
record
as
certified
to
this
court
from
the
seventh
circuit.
your
clerk
directed
what
was
to
go
into
that
record.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
no
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
judge
holder
later
did
modify
his
order.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
it
has
been,
yes
your
honor.
there
are
--
to
my
knowledge
he
did
not,
again
i'm
speaking
from
a
record
that
has
been
created
since
this
occurred.
he
did
modify
the
order.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
i'm
--
i'm
sure
he
did.
i'm
sure
he
did.
now
whether
he
named
the
four
doctors
or
not
i
cannot
say.
but
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
there
is
no
reported
case
under
the
federal
laws
where
a
federal
court
has
granted
such
a
petition
even
for
an
examination
of
a
defendant
by
one
doctor,
let
alone,
four
or
not.
there
is
not
a
reported
case
anywhere
that
we
have
been
able
to
search
and
find.
if
this
--
a
state
of
affair
should
be
permitted
to
exist
that
the
rule
should
be
interpreted
in
that
manner,
it
would
simply
mean
that
every
united
states
district
court
of
the
land
would
become
a
damage
in
the
court
where
you
could
do
the
things
in
that
court
that
you
cannot
do
in
your
state
court.
indiana
does
not
permit
the
examination
of
a
defendant
--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
we
have
that
position
of
course,
but
not
physical
examinations
and
i
know
of
no
state
that
does
physical
examination
of
a
defendant.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
--
that's
what
i
intent
to
say,
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
that
is
correct.
if
the
purpose
of
that
examination
was
solely
to
prove
contributory
negligence.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
oh,
we
can
--
we
can
file
interrogatories
and
due
--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
that
is
correct.
here
we
have
a
petition
for
a
physical
and
mental
examination
of
schlagenhauf
filed
six
months
after
the
accident
happened
and
the
petitioner
doesn't
even
alleged
that
any
physical
or
mental
defect
that
might
possibly
be
discovered
was
approximate
cause,
contributory
cause
or
the
remote
cause
or
anything
else
of
this
accident.
mr.
robert
s.
smith
their
letter
your
honor
says
that
--
mr.
robert
s.
smith
that
is
contained
in
the
letter,
yes
your
honor.
