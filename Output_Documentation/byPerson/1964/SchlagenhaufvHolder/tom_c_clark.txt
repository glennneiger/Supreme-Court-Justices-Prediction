justice
tom
c.
clark
but
national
lead
included
the
bus
driver
in
their
cross-claim
as
a
part
of
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
they
filed
the
application
for
the
examination?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
it
is
filed
after
they
filed
their
cross
action?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
they
alleged
that
the
bus
driver
was
negligent
and
that
is
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
contract
carriers
alleged
that
he
was
mentally
incompetent?
justice
tom
c.
clark
so
what's
your
point?
frankly,
i'm
sorry.
i
see
–
i
don't
--
he
is
a
party
of
the
national
lead,
he's
a
party
as
to
the
original
plaintiffs,
but
your
point
here
was
not
a
party
for
contract
carriers?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
greyhound
has
filed
also,
was
it
greyhound
or
what
was
the
name
of
that?
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
had
filed
as
i
understand
a
cross
action
against
the
national
lead
and
contract
carriers?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
of
course
the
bus
driver
just
their
agent
and
–
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
possibly
with
judgment
through
[inaudible]
they
were
caused
to
representing
him
also
on
that,
is
that
right?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
say
that
the
same
lawyer
represented
the
bus
driver
representing
the
bus
company
as
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
mr.
smith
is
--
is
your
position
then
that
the
rule
is
not
applicable
except
as
to
a
party
who
joined
this
issue
with
some
other
party
on
the
matter
of
his
mental
or
physical
health
–
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
i
know
but
i
--
i
am
as
confused
as
my
brother
clark
i'm
not
quite
clear.
i
thought
you
were
telling
us
that
your
position
is
that
the
rule
is
not
applicable
except
in
the
instance
where
a
party
who
in
the
examination
of
whom
is
sought
has
joined
issue
with
some
other
party
on
the
issue
of
his
mental
and
physical
health,
is
that
right?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
your
point
here
is
that
schlagenhauf
whatever
his
name
is,
has
not
joined
issue
with
anyone.
justice
tom
c.
clark
on
the
matter
of
his
mental
and
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
it
so
set
out
in
our
appendix
that
is
so
brought
up
and
it's
so
certified
by
the
judge
himself
directing
us
to
file
that
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
one
of
the
[inaudible]
to
the
judgment
that
in
the
motion
incorporates
the
letter.
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
to
the
judge
which
to
site
that
they
had
a
pretrial
conference
that
that
conference
he
was
instructed
to
do
certain
things.
he
was
never
for
advancing
a
judge,
he
was
alleging
his
--
on
page
21
and
he
said
there
that
schlagenhauf
was
mentally
and
--
[inaudible]
here.
it's
page
40.
the
defendant
greyhound
corporation
carry
this
thing
that
he
is
employed
until
his
driver
expecting
to
have
--
to
operate
the
said
bus
from
public
highway
although
it
says
like
an

he's
not
mentally
or
physically
capable
of
operating
the
said
bus
from
the
sort
of
tallies
at
the
time
and
place
when
the
said
accident
occurred.
which
fact
is
known
and
should
have
been
known
grade
in.
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
was
before
their
motion
and
there
motion
refers
to
the
letter,
refers
to
their
claim
of
mental
incompetence.
the
motion
which
starts
on
page
7
refers
to
that
as
i
understand
that
the
judge
had
been
able
to
take
notice
of
the
fact
that
they
had
alleged
the
mentally
incompetence
of
the
party
