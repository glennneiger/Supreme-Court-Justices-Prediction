justice

that
line
hold
the
practices
of
filing
interrogative
of
defendants
whether
they
have
that
method
of
doing
this,
what's
done
is,
the
suit
is
filed
in
both
places.
you
can
have
the
[inaudible]
and
along
with
that,
the
plaintiff
filed
interrogatively
to
the
defendant,
asking
questions.
he
doesn't
give
a
notice
to
get
the
issue.
he
wants
to
get
evidence
to
try
after
they
issue
the
form.
what's
the
difference
in
that
and
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
they
--
he
would
have
had
objection
opportunity
when
they
began
to
ask
him
questions
or
examine
him,
wouldn't
they,
did
he
file
a
motion
to
set
it
aside?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
didn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
--
i
wasn't
only
assuming
that
it
was
the
original
decision
here.
but
it's
sealed,
but
it's
a
--
and
he
has
the
right
to
file
interrogatory,
so
the
plaintiff
tried
them
off
and
they
have
the
right
to
file
to
the
defendant
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
there's
an
issue
drawn
when
he
files
interrogatories
to
interrogate
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
haven't
made
an
effort
going
after
the
court.
you
didn't
go
back
to
the
court
and
say
look
here
we
didn't
have
notice
to
do
it,
now
we
want
to
cancel
this
or
reverse
it
or
get
it
to
be
set
aside
and
then
we
can
draw
some,
or
file
an
objection.
you
just
immediately
took
the
position
that
there's
no,
no
right
to
do
it
because
there
had
been
no
issue
drawn.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
didn't
--
why
didn't
--
if
you
had
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
yet
it
amounted
anything,
why
didn't
you
present
it
to
the
judge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
could
have
--
you
could
have
bound
him
i
believe.
justice
hugo
l.
black
besides
this
thinking
--
the
investigation
so
far
as
sibbach
versus
wilson,
what
can
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
reflection
you
made
or
physically
examination
of
the
defendant
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
that
the
plaintiff
is
to
be
subjected
to
be
put
into
the
examination
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
there's
been
denied
the
right
to
examine
a
plaintiff,
personal
injuries
or
something
that
is
material
to
the
case
on
the
ground
that
there
had
been
no
forum,
pleading
issues,
pending,
you
know
of
any,
i
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
still
it
wouldn't
be
the
views
of
discretion
if
the
judge
requires
nine
examinations
of
the
man
instead
of
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
i
completely
understand
it
but
this
is
a
mandamus,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
here's
the
ground.
if
one
of
the
grounds
--
is
there
in
the
ground
that
it's
void
because
there
were
too
many
examinations
going.
i
didn't
understand
that
was
an
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
another
thing
that
could
correct
it
though.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
he
was
claiming
that
there
was
no
power
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
another
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
a
defendant
though
you
cannot,
the
plaintiff
was
in
this
objective
into
the
same
examination,
i
assume
that's
not
arguable.
is
it
argued
that
because
he's
the
defendant
he
is
immune
from
the
same
kind
of
inquiry
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
should
be
made
on
examination
the
same
with
the
plaintiff?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
argued
also
i
thought
that
it
has
to
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
one
of
the
arguments
i'm
not
sure
on
what
you
say
and
what
he
says
but
you
can
examine
to
find
if
a
physical
defect
like
an
absence
of
an
arm
or
absence
of
vision
see,
but
you
can
examine
to
see
if
the
mental
defect
as
did
mike
have
is
or
a
motor
disaster
effect.
is
that
one
of
the
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
hope
your
case
doesn't
stand
on
this
argument
you
have
made
with
all
individual
rights
in
this
country
and
be
subjected
by
the
legislative
and
to
hit
the
grounds
to
what
they
say
is
the
common
good.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suggest
that
you
read
--
i
suggest
that
you
read
the
state
law
that
make
you
to
ask
the
question
unless
they've
changed
as
i
knew
them
but
at
least
[inaudible]
practically,
one
of
the
best
thing
that
the
party
in
the
lawsuit
did
in
that
case
would
try
to
find
that
if
the
plaintiff
or
the
other
fellow
was
not
the
man
who
is
doing
the
work
possibly
injury
and
did
have
some
defect
and
to
find
out
if
there
was
any
negligence
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
discovery
instantly
in
those
kinds
of
cases.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
drawing
a
distinction
not
as
i
understand
it,
not
between
whether
the
issue
is
one
of
negligence
but
whether
the
relief
of
question
is
a
physical
or
mental
examination
of
the
party.
