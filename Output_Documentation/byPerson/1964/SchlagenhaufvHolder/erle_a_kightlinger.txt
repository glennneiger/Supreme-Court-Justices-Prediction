mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
mr.
chief
justice
–
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
–
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset
i
would
like
on
behalf
of
this
respondent
make
one
correction.
this
order
was
filed
on
february,
the
petition
was
filed
on
february
the
5th.
it
laid
upon
the
dockets
of
the
court
for
a
period
of
15
days
which
under
the
local
rules
are
required
in
order
to
file
anything
in
opposition,
and
it
laid
one
day
longer
and
then
the
district
judge
entered
this
order
upon
february
the
21st.
the
trans
--
the
transcript
in
this
case
shows
that
it
was
served
by
united
states
mail
pursuant
to
the
federal
rules
and
was
put
in
the
mails
and
there
has
never
been
in
all
of
the
transactions
including
before
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
the
suggestion
until
i
just
heard
it
that
this
petition
was
not
properly
filed
and
notice
made
and
laid
upon
the
court
records.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
that's
correct.
and
the
transcript
shows
that
a
male
in
service
in
this
--
in
this
record
sir,
so
that
this
point
was
never
made
before
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
it's
never
been
mentioned
in
the
brief.
it's
not
been
mentioned
in
any
transcript
and
i
say
to
the
court
that
this
matter
did
lie
for
21
days
before
there
was
--
for
16
days
before
there
was
any
action
taken
which
is
required
under
the
local
rules
that
there
be
a
15-day
period
in
order
that
any
opposition
or
objection
be
filed
thereto.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
i'm
speaking
of
the
petitioner,
contract
carriers?
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
to
which
national
lead
also
joined
and
--
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
well,
they
filed
a
petition
at
--
at
the
identical
times
in
which
they
set
up
certain
(voice
overlap)
they
serve
theirs
too
--
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
then
the
record
shows
that.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
that
is
correct
sir
but
there
was
also
a
filing
before
there
was
filing
action
of
the
cross-claim.
now
i
would
like
to
point
this
out
under
our
federal
rules.
they
have
been
most
useful
and
in
the
discovery
areas
we
place
a
lot
of
emphasis
because
we're
really
dealing
with
notice-pleading.
and
we're
not
dealing
with
code-pleading
as
is
suggested
here.
this
rule
does
not
say
where
the
physical
or
mental
condition
is
an
issue,
it
says
it
is
in
controversy
and
i
say
it
under
the
federal
rules
even
if
the
forms
were
applied,
if
a
plaintiff
files
a
suit
against
two
co-defendants
and
said
“you
are
negligent,”
that
suffices.
from
that
point
on
the
discovery
of
procedures
are
resorted
to
in
order
to
get
at
the
facts.
now,
it's
always
possible
for
a
co-defendant
under
that
situation
to
prove
and
to
discover
it
that
would
enable
them
to
side
that
the
other
co-defendant
is
solely
negligent
by
his
neglect.
but
later
under
this
particular
district
court's
requirement
for
purposes
of
instruction,
there
was
a
--
there
was
a
letter
part
indicating
that
the
mental
and
phy
–
physical
condition
of
this
petitioner
was
placed
in
issue
by
the
contributory
negligence
allegation
in
the
special
answer.
later
--
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
mr.
justice
goldberg
this
is
the
practice.
this
particular
judge
in
which
he
had
pretrial,
he
instructs
all
parties
where
they
have
not
spelled
out
specific
acts
of
negligence
to
spell
them
out
and
to
indicate
whether
they
are
common
law
or
statutory
violations
and
this
letter
was
in
compliance
with
that
order
at
the
pretrial
conference.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
right
sir.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
yes
sir.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
that's
correct
sir,
that's
the
sequence.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
there
was
no
formal,
there
was
no
formal
hearing
at
anytime
but
there
was
the
petition,
there
was
an
affidavit
that
by
other
discovery
procedures
it
was
discovered
that
the
same
driver
schlagenhauf
for
greyhound
that
had
a
similar
accident
in
flat
rock,
michigan
previously.
it
was
also
pointed
out
that
on
the
day
of
this
very
tragic
accident
there
was
another
observer
who
was
similarly
positioned
to
schlagenhauf
on
the
highway
and
did
see
lights
in
this
trailer
for
half
a
mile
to
three
quarters
and
there
was
further
evidence
of
discovery
up
to
this
time
that
was
part
of
the
affidavit
that
schlagenhauf
himself
admitted
that
he
saw
lights
for
10
to
15
seconds
and
although
we're
on
a
four-lane
highway
in
which
he
has
two
lanes
he
made
no
effort
to
deviate
or
to
move
from
that
position.
so
all
of
this
was
before
the
judge
without
any
opposition
filed
under
the
local
rules
within
the
15-day
period
that
was
laid
upon
the
record
sir.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
well
sir
in
the
field
of
this
sort
of
thing
where
there
are
visual
problems.
in
addition
to
that
there
can
even
be
people
who
operate
vehicles
and
become
terrifically
aggressive
when
they're
in
a
vehicle
and
there's
no
other
car.
there
are
instances
when
people
are
known
under
these
situations
to
even
have
suicidal
impacts.
now,
all
of
these
factors
including
the
visual
where
you
can't
find
function,
the
disturbances
is
a
proper
area
of
psychiatry
and
there's
no
reason
why
we
wouldn't
examine
this
man
from
his
eyesight
and
from
other
viewpoints
and
at
the
same
time
may
find
the
underlying
psychiatric
problems
that
could
lead
here
to
the
difficult
so
that
the
court
and
we're
dealing
with
a
common
carrier
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
this
anomaly.
on
page
36
i
think
of
the
petitioner's
brief
they
point
out
that
it
would
have
sufficed
had
we
taken
the
medical
reports
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission
upon
this
man
schlagenhauf
and
used
them
in
the
court.
now
irrespective
of
the
question
of
evidence
on
whether
they
could
be,
isn't
it
an
interesting
approach
that
this
man
is
willing
to
submit
himself
to
physical
examinations
by
an
administrative
tribunal,
but
when
the
court
insist
it
becomes
an
issue
of
the
inviolability
of
the
person.
now,
there
are
constitute
--
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
no
sir.
i
think
that
if
there
are
affidavits
filed
that
there
are
similar
accidents
that
he's
driving
a
vehicle
in
the
common
carrier
type
that
other
people
saw
a
thing
that
he
didn't
see
and
that
there
was
10
to
15
seconds
intervening
that
when
that
sort
of
cause
is
shown
and
then
the
--
those
that
oppose
it
do
not
come
in
within
that
15-day
period
and
lay
up
on
the
table
any
type
of
contrary
affidavit
or
any
type
of
contrary
information
then
i
say
sir
that
a
good
cause
is
shown
in
the
district
court,
the
respondent
here
was
absolutely
proper
in
exercising
the
discretion
which
is
given
to
him
under
this
rule
and
that
it's
becoming
increasingly
more
useful
in
this
complex
society
where
there
are
people
at
the
wheel
or
at
the
airplane
or
at
the
throttle
on
fast
moving
equipment
and
so
on
and
these
explanations
of
these
accidents
can
also
be
uncovered
through
reasonable,
physical
examination.
now
i
will
say
that
of
course
the
district
court
cannot
just
automatically
do
it,
but
he
must
being
on
the
firing
line
with
the
cause
field
that
there's
good
and
justifiable
cause
in
order
to
grant
such
an
order
and
i
think
that
was
replete
here
and
it
was
so
seen
by
the
seventh
circuit,
court
of
appeals
in
considering
this
question.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
to
that
extent
sir
i
think
that
is
correct
and
whether
or
not
the
motive
there
was
busy
a
judge
who
signed
an
order
for
which
he
should
have
made
selection
but
the
point
still
remains
that
after
the
seventh
circuit
decision
is
rendered
and
after
the
stay
order
was
lifted
this
matter
was
represented
to
the
crowd
judge
and
he
reduced
these
orders
to
four.
so
as
we
stand
here
before
this
court
we‘re
dealing
with
an
order
in
which
there
were
four
physical
examinations
and
the
nine
that
was
the
subject
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
a
matter
that
is
moot
and
we
still
say
that
unless
the
court
were
to
render
a
decision
and
vacuum
it
would
--
the
recognition
of
this
new
development
in
this
case
since
the
ord
--
extraordinary
writ
of
mandate
is
being
sought
that
we're
now
dealing
with
multiple
examinations
of
four
and
that
is
not
shopping,
i
know
of
many,
many
instances
where
plaintiffs
submit
their
cases
upon
medical
evidence
that
involves
their
own
doctors,
their
treating
doctors,
their
experts
and
in
addition
thereto
the
defense
so
that
it
is
not
on
them
and
counting
to
have
four
or
five
doctors
testifying
as
to
medical
condition
of
an
individual.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
i
believe
that's
an
appropriate
conclusion
sir.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
oh
yes,
i
think
that
the
pleadings
were
filed
and
i
know
of
no
instance
where
there
was
an
opportunity
to
--
to
file
appropriate
pleadings
to
national
leads
counter-claim.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
well,
there's
been
fi
--
there's
been
answers
filed
in
those
cases
that
issues
that
have
been
closed.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
yes,
i'm
sure
there
has
been.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
this
case
was
actually
set
with
all
of
these
pleadings
for
trial
by
the
district
court
and
the
state
proceeding
--
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
well,
there's
certainly
it's
a
--
it's
in
the
case.
it
might
have
been
filed
subsequently.
the
clerk
refused
to
print
anything
in
this
record
other
than
what
was
before
the
circuit
court
of
appeal.
now,
i
--
i
know
that
the
matter
has
–
the
issues
have
been
closed
and
i
supposed
the
clerk
was
very
proper
in
that
but
the
district
judge
did
order
me
as
an
attorney
for
him
to
file
with
this
court
and
bring
these
proceedings
to
date.
now
the
issues
have
been
closed
but
i
--
i
think
it's
very
possible
that
that
was
not
closed
at
the
time
that
the
matter
went
before
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
but
that
it
has
been
since
then.
but
i
don't
consider
that
to
--
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
the
--
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
mr.
justice
black
i
don't
think
there
are
any
with
the
exception
that
this
is
a
seeking
a
physical
examination
of
the
defendant
who
is
a
part
of
the
rule
doesn't
confine
it
to
--
to
plaintiffs
who
were
seeking
personal
injury,
it
says
a
party.
the
real
doesn't
confine
it
to
one
who
seeks
the
federal
orbit
as
a
forum.
the
rationale
as
suggested
by
the
petitioner
here
that
one
who
seeks
the
forum
therefore
waves
some
constitutional
right.
well,
we
know
this
right
is
highly
qualified.
it's
not
in
an
absolute
sense
whatsoever.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
no,
i
know
of
none
but
the
rationale
there
is
that
the
plaintiff
by
filing
his
action
is
seeking
personal
injury
in
the
complaint
and
therefore
it's
an
issue
upon
the
complaint
even
under
the
very
limited
notice
form
of
this
court
it
would
still
require
that
statement
sir.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
there
is
no
case
to
my
knowledge
and
that's
the
unique
--
uniqueness
of
this
case
before
the
court.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
--
from
exhibit
and
it
has
to
do
with
the
defendant.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
that's
correct
but
this
--
but
this
whole
area
of
discovery,
someone
talks
about
substantive
rights
being
involved
and
what
we're
really
doing
is
seeking
out
the
truth
by
all
of
the
discovery
methods
which
has
its
impact
ultimately
up
on
substantive
rights.
but
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
a
defendant
is
put
in
a
position
and
asked
questions
from
which
he
indicts
himself
as
to
the
facts
under
a
deposition
procedure
or
whether
he's
subjected
to
physical
examinations
and
we
find
the
explanation
for
one
of
these
tragic
accidents
and
this
is
not
an
unusual
occurrence
where
men
because
of
physical
disability
and
incapacity
of
some
sort
of
another
find
themselves
in
a
serious
accidents
involving
trucks,
air
craft,
and
various
other
methods
of
modern
transportation.
and
the
suggestions
that
are
made
for
the
petitioner
here
would
take
us
back
to
pre
botsford
days.
these
rules
have
had
terrific
utility
and
they
should
be
brought
--
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
sir?
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
well,
how
many
instances
that
perhaps
the
--
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
no
sir.
this
is
--
this
is
the
first
instance
where
we
have
explored
it,
but
there
was
the
first
instance
when
we
used
in
the
paternity
suit
in
the
district
of
columbia.
there
was
the
first
instance
when
it
was
used
under
a
warrant
of
arrest
policy.
there
was
a
--
there's
been
the
first
instance
under
these
rules
and
many
examples
where
a
plaintiff
who
was
just
seeking
personal
injuries,
this
rule
has
been
expanded
and
that
utilities
expanded
and
i
think
in
this
day
of
modern
transportation
we're
upgrading
this
whole
situations
who
are
recognition
of
a
very
definite
fact
and
that
is
in
the
areas
of
hot
conditions,
many
other
physical
factors,
these
are
explanations
for
many
of
these
tragic
accidents
and
this
was
an
unusual
one.
this
was
an
accident
resulting
in
demands
well
in
excess
to
$2
million,
a
young
boy
who
is
maimed
for
life
with
the
most
serious
riding
on
a
common
carrier
and
the
common
carrier
having
two
similar
accidents
with
their
driver
of
this
sort
and
so
on.
now,
there
had
been
suggestions
made
to
the
court
that
there
were
constitutional
questions
involved
here.
and
of
course
sibbach,
put
at
rest
in
our
opinion
any
constitutional
questions.
now,
with
the
precise
--
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
it
--
it
did
this.
it
said
that
the
--
that
the
rule
35
was
procedural
in
its
origins.
it
was
therefore
consistent
with
the
enabling
act
and
this
rule
then
was
reported
from
the
court
to
the
congress
without
change
or
deviation
and
through
that
process.
i
would
say
that
that
it
was
attacked
on
constitutional
grounds,
but
it
--
even
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
his
dissent
as
to
the
reasoning
said
there's
no
question
but
what
there's
no
constitutional
question
here
that
this
is
still
within
the
power
that
it's
still
procedural
and
not
subsidy
and
that
it
--
it's
still
consistent
with
the
whole
scheme
of
things
under
our
discovery
procedures.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
mr.
chief
justice
i
think
in
all
frankness
to
the
court
that
it
was
an
example
of
a
busy
judge
who
had
submitted
to
him
a
prepared
order
which
is
the
custom
in
which
there
were
nine
named
doctors
from
which
he
could
make
selection
and
instead
of
making
this
selection
of
the
required
number
he
by
inadvertence
signed
the
order
as
to
the
norm.
but
that
that
would
be
my
only
explanation
of
the
matter
and
i
don't
think
it
would
have
ever
occurred
had
within
the
15-day
period,
the
petitioner
made
any
steps
here
and
we
do
all
agree
that
busy
trial
judges
who
keep
their
calendars
up
frequently
are
confronted
with
these
situations
but
that
matter
is
that
we
have
now
appear
before
this
court
is
completely
corrected.
and
i
think
it's
an
important
situation
because
this
court
has
never
indulged
in
moot
questions
and
has
never
indulged
in
thinking
in
vacuum
and
--
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
mr.
chief
justice
we
did
so
argue
and
there
we
argued
also
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
because
we
don't
know
what
was
in
his
mind.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
we
don't
know
what
was
in
his
mind
but
we
also
argued
there
that
he
could
have
been
motivated
just
as
well
in
the
exercise
of
the
discretion
by
not
putting
all
of
schlagenhauf's
models
in
one
basket
if
you
want
to
out
it
that
way
and
gave
multiple
examinations
here
so
there
would
be
no
possible
question
after
virtually
this
board
of
doctors
reach
their
conclusion
as
to
what
was
the
true
condition
of
this
man
and
he
was
not
being
asked
to
submit
to
one
doctor
and
what
he
might
say
but
he
was
being
asked
to
submit
in
all
of
these
specialties
so
that
there
would
be
no
question
afterwards
because
of
this
disaster
as
to
the
situation.
so
to
that
extent
sir
it
was
so
argued
before
the
circuit
court
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit
took
the
position
that
this
was
a
discretionary
matter
that
it
was
within
the
corners
of
the
court
and
it
would
not
as
an
appeal
court
invade
the
discretion
of
the
court
in
the
--
on
the
basis
if
this
record
in
the
trial
court
by
the
extraordinary
writ
of
mandate
which
by
has
been
stated
by
this
court
time
and
time
again
should
only
be
issued
when
the
district
court
is
virtually
nullifying
the
rule
by
an
excess
exercise
of
power
beyond
the
intention
of
the
rule.
i'm
sorry
my
time,
i'm
not
sure
where
i
am.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
the
logic
of
my
argument
is
that
in
an
--
but
i
do
want
to
insist
upon
one
point
that
the
trial
judge
must
have
before
him
certain
facts
in
an
affidavit
form
or
in
form
that
would
justify
his
conclusions.
now,
i
don't
think
we
can
say
that
in
every
negligence
case
a
co-defendant
or
any
defendant
is
going
to
be
subjected
to
a
psychiatric
or
mental
examination.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
mr.
justice
goldberg
that's
the
logic
of
my
position
when
we
put
in
that
question.
we
do
--
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
multiple
examinations
as
i've
said
had
been
recognized
under
rule
and
when
we
start
drawing
the
line,
is
it
going
to
be
two,
is
it
going
to
be
five?
i've
pointed
out
that
in
my
experience
i
have
frequently
found
plaintiffs
in
serious
cases
with
six
doctors,
five
doctors,
testifying.
now
i
can
see
in
this
area
of
medical
specialty
and
specialization
that
multiple
examinations
will
be
in
appropriate
cases
will
be
the
answer.
and
they
will
be
pursued
and
if
they're
on
the
plaintiff
there's
no
reason
in
the
world
why
they
shouldn't
be
pursued
and
the
defendant
subjected
to
the
same
sort
of
discovery
procedure
and
other
in
order
to
--
i
know
that
then
what
are
we
doing.
we're
unearthing
the
truth,
the
truth
for
in
the
courtroom.
and
this
suggestion
of
the
inviolability
of
the
person
in
this
case
where
there's
a
qualified
right
to
begin
with
is
false
–
i
suppose
boy
and
girl
today
go
down
to
get
their
license
for
their
wedding,
for
a
marriage,
and
are
subjected
to
a
requirement
administratively,
a
blood
test
would
prefer
not
to
have
such
a
test,
but
it's
a
qualified
right.
you
might
say,
well
we
don't
have
to
get
married.
they
can
refuse
to
get
married
but
the
point
is
that
in
our
society
these
rights
are
qualified
and
there's
no
reason
why
this
right
shouldn't
cut
both
ways
in
order
for
us
to
get
at
the
backs
prior
to
trial
and
in
pretrial
and
find
out
frequently
as
it
could
have
been
here.
what
could
have
been
the
cause
of
this
tragic
accident
and
what
would
have
happened
in
the
end?
suppose
this
man
submitted
which
he
hasn't
done
now
and
we'd
find
there's
nothing
wrong
physically
or
mentally
with
him.
he's
been
inconvenienced,
yes,
but
supposed
we
find
that
he
does
have
serious
physical
disability
that
accounts
for
these
two
accidents
or
mental
disturbances
that
accounts
for
these
two
accidents,
then
i
say
a
miscarriage
of
justice
has
been
averted
and
the
truth
has
been
sustained
in
the
spirit
of
the
federal
rule.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
this
is
a
writ
seeking
under
the
all
writs
act,
a
mandate
against
the
court
to
expunge
from
his
record,
to
mandate
and
to
the
expand
from
the
record
of
disorder.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
yes,
i
think
impliedly
throughout
the
argument
of
the
petitioner,
they
have
suggested
that
the
--
that
the
fact
that
there
were
nine
just
as
the
chief
justice
suggested
that
there
were
nine
requested
--
oh,
only
four
requested
and
--
and
nine
actually
granted
that
that
was
of
an
in
itself
an
indication
of
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
that
--
that
has
sir.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
he
--
he
did
do
that
sir
but
the
argument
is
presented
here
to
the
court
this
morning,
i
did
not
get
that
implication
and
i
did
not
deal
with
the
areas
of
constitutionality
which
i
think
long
ago
been
foreclosed
by
this
court's
decision
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
sad
day,
we
went
back
to
pre
botsford
day
and
the
like
and
the
--
and
the
language
is
clear,
the
operation
of
this
rule
is
clear
and
i
would
think
it
would
be
as
i've
said
a
sad
day
for
us
to
strike
at
discovery
and
i'm
not
so
sure
that
it
wouldn't
also
create
a
lot
of
problems
in
other
areas
because
if
there,
if
that
is
without
--
without
power
then
it
must
be
on
the
theory
that
there's
a
constitutional
innovation
and
this
court
has
never
to
my
knowledge
ever
suggested
that
there
were
any
constitutional
problems
involved
here
whatsoever.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
--
to
prove
negligence?
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
again,
we're
in
areas
where
many
of
these
things
under
rules
are
not
reported.
the
dinsel
--
the
dinsel
case
that's
in
this
file
indicates
one
court
felt
that
there
was
an
inherent
power
in
the
court
to
take
a
driver
of
a
co-defendant
--
of
a
defendant
and
subject
him
to
a
physical
examination
either
even
though
the
rule
didn't
apply.
now,
that's
one
instance
i
think
--
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
no
sir,
there
was
a
proposal
made
to
this
court
to
permit
the
agent
who
is
not
a
named
party
to
be
physically
examined
just
as
the
named
party
would
be
and
this
court
as
far
as
advisory
committee
was
concerned
the
impression
i
get
from
it
was
that
this
court
took
the
position
that
it
should
occur
at
that
point.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
well
i
did
invisibly.
that
was
the
one
i
will
say
that
to
my
knowledge
there
are
not
a
great
many
cases
in
this
area.
but
if
this
court
wanted
to
say
a
plaintiff
who
pursues
personal
injury,
in
the
rule
it
could
have
easily
been
said
or
if
you
just
wanted
to
say
anyone
who
pursues
--
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
yes.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
yes,
mr.
justice
black
that's
exactly
what
has
been
argued
and
it
had
been
argued
by
the
petitioner
here
and
they've
even
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
rationale
is
if
you
pursue
a
remedy
in
the
federal
forum
then
you
subject
yourself
on
a
waiver
theory.
now,
our
point
about
that
is
suppose
the
defendant
removes
the
matter
to
federal
court
and
he
selected
the
forum
does
he
then
subject
himself
but
the
plaintiff
does
not.
now
all
of
the
--
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
pardon.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
as
i
view
their
brief,
they're
merely
saying
that
a
defendant
and
it's
just
not
sub
--
subject
to
a
examination
unless
under
some
circumstances
brought
himself
into
the
federal
orbit
of
the
forum
and
on
a
consent
or
waiver
theory
and
they
go
back
to
the
botsford
language
and
the
use
the
botsford
language
about
the
inviolability
of
the
person
and
they
bring
it
in
to
this
courtroom
at
this
later
date
and
all
these
years
after
when
we
all
know
that
we're
dealing
in
no
absolute
sense
with
any
rights
in
a
modern
society.
all
rights
are
modified
to
the
common
good
and
this
is
one
that
is.
the
power
is
clearly
here,
the
--
the
power
to
subject
it
as
far
as
the
defendant
is
concerned
is
clearly
here.
and
so
this
court
has
narrowed
down
as
we
stand
here
at
the
moment
to
interfere
with
the
discretion
of
the
district
court
on
the
theory
of
nine
or
four
examinations
as
i
see
it
and
that's
how
this
case
is
narrowed.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
no,
i
don't
think
i
--
i
meant
that
but
i
did
say
that
the
inviolability
of
the
person
certainly
in
a
modern
society
as
we
hammer
out
the
respective
rights
are
not
in
any
absolute
sense
particularly
as
we
deal
with
it
here
such
a
right
that
it
isn't
qualified
as
to
the
common
good
of
society.
now
that
doesn't
mean
that
any
court
by
virtually
edict
with
this
--
this
thing
here
has
been
growing
for
five
centuries,
the
assertion
that
it
was
not
in
the
common
law
but
for
five
centuries
as
wigmore
brings
out
clear
back
in
the
days
when
the
emphasis
upon
the
property.
this
rule
was
developed.
i
believe
i've
exceeded
my
time,
i
apologize.
mr.
erle
a.
kightlinger
we
do
that
too
and
the
point
is
that
by
the
process
of
discovery
there
are
many
of
these
cases
disposed
then
without
trial
because
the
truth
is
out
upon
the
--
on
the
table
and
for
all
to
see
and
of
all
these
cases
had
be
to
tried,
the
--
the
federal
courts
would
be
so
congested
as
they
are
in
many
instances
that
would
be
impossible
that's
how
useful
the
discovery
are.
thank
you
sir.
