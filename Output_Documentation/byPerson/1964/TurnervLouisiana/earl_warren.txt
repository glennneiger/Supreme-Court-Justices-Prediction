what
was
the
extent
of
the
fraternization
that

earl
warren
was
--
was
this
chief
deputy
cross
examined
on
the
trial
itself

was
cross
examined.

chief

your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren

i
suppose
that

beginning
of
the
trial
you
would
have
to
make
it
on

court

there
would
(inaudible).

any
power

about
the
statement

witnesses
made
as
related
by
counsel
to
the
effect
that
during
his
custody
of
this
jury
he
made
no
acquaintances
and
removed
all
friendships.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
that
that
is

--
chief

earl
warren
--
sociable
conversation
and
--

i
beg

what
i
want.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
understood
the
counsel
that
one
of
these
deputies
had
lunch
with
the
jury.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
the
statute
require
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
your
--
is
that
your
question
to
down
there
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
have
them
get
accustomed
with
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
deputy's
eats
--
lunches
with
the
jury?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
an
isolated
instance
and
being
in
louisiana's
provision
that
the
deputy
does
eat
with
them
frequently.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
have
no
idea
for
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
speaks
in
telling
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
maybe
bad
without
taking
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
pierson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
pierson,
i
noticed
from
the
record
that
this
man
was
an
indigent
and
that
you
are
appointed
by
the
court
to
represent
him
and
that
you
have
carried
this
case
through
to
this
court
and
on
behalf
of
the
court
i
want
to
express
our
appreciation
to
you
for
accepting
what
we
consider
as
a
real
public
service
on
the
part
of
lawyers.
we're
always
confident
to
know
that
lawyers
will
accept
appointments
of
this
kind
from
the
court
to
represent
indigent
and
unpopular
defense.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
at
the
same
time,
mr.
yokum,
i
want
to
commend
you
for
the
fair,
frank
and
diligent
manner
in
which
you
have
performed
your
public
service
of
representing
your
state.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
we
would
like
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren

is
it
here?
oh,

you

really
into
that
responsibility

yokum.

well,

go
to
the
next
case.
