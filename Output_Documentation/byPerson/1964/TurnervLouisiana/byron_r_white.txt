mr.

justice
byron
r.

under
constitutional
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
nature
of
the
--
i
gather
that
one
of
the
deputy
testified
they
both
have
the
--
jurisdiction
was
made
by
or
confessions
made
by
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
confession
of
his
ability
to
protect
the
appellant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
whatever
do
you
want?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
did
you
challenge
the
voluntari
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
voluntariness
--
the
voluntariness
that
the
resolution
of
the
--
that
the
state's
evidence
on
voluntariness
is
given
by
these
two
deputies?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
one
of
these
fellows?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
a
case
where
the
testimony
of
the
--
did
the
accused
testified?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
voluntariness?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
was
his
testimony
and
--
well,
and
his
testimony
and
the
testimony
of
the
deputy
then
were
uphold?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
before
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
was
no
conflict
between
the
two
--
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
and
the
deputy
before
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
of
the
deputy
on
voluntary.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
weren't
permitted
to
put
the
defendant
on
the
stand
for
the
limited
purpose
of
voluntariness
that
would
have
exposed
into
general
--
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
address
your
position
here
from
a
narrow
ground
that
the
trial
court
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
or
that
(inaudible)
indictment?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
distinction
between
the
deputies
of
the
witness
and
an
outsider.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
even
if
one
is
bad
or
the
other
is
bad
or
either
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
understand
that.
i
understand
that.
but
i
take
it
that
--
i
take
it
that
if
a
witness
had
been
allowed
--
a
non-deputy
witness
have
been
allowed
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
associate
with
the
jury
like
the
deputy
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
i
know
but
i
--
forget
that
case
we
had.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
particular
case,
if
a
witness,
a
non
deputy
witness
had
been
allowed
to
associate
with
the
jury,
you
would
i
supposed
think
it
was
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
now
here
the
deputy
who
talks
to
me
and
associates
with
the
jury.
now
why
is
the
one
bad
and
not
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
do
you
suppose
in
actuality
or
in
operative
result
why
is
the
one
bad
and
the
other
not?
is
it
just
because
that
the
necessity
of
somebody
has
to
take
care
of
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there's
some
explanation
for
him
being
there
and
he's
not
been
a
witness.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
think
you
went
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
all
of
that?
