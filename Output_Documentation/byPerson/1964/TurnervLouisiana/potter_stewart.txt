the
louisiana
supreme
court
opinion
cites
a
federal
court
of
appeals
decision
which
seems
to
be
odell
against
hudspeth
which
seems
to
be
this
very
case
right
before
the
court.
is
that
correct,
the
requisite
that
i
have
read
that
exclusionary.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
circuit
opinion
about
--
i
just
--
i
thought
perhaps
you
had
it
in
mind?
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
do
this
trial
last?
justice
potter
stewart
three
full
days.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
was
the
jury
--
the
question
that
night
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
addition
to
these
two
deputies
did
other
people
also
have
some
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
of
these?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
know.
justice
potter
stewart
but
these
two
were
not
the
sole
for
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
--
you
pointed
out
that
this
had
happened
more
than
once
in
this
parish
in
louisiana.
justice
potter
stewart
did
it
happen
in
the
other
parishes?
justice
potter
stewart
then
the
case
in
your
--
in
your
supreme
court
and
in
any
other
parish?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
there
are
how
many
from
this
parish?
justice
potter
stewart
two
very
recently.
justice
potter
stewart
ponchatoula?
justice
potter
stewart
this
hammond
--
you
pointed
out
directly
that
these
--
where
all
the
small
parish
with
definitely
limited
eating
facilities
and
so
on
and
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
there
are
12
deputies.
justice
potter
stewart
and
of
course
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
case
where
it
was
known
in
advance
becasuse
i'm
sure
it
must
have
been
in
this
case
that
one
or
two
of
the
deputies
are
going
to
be
witnesses
for
the
state
this
whole
thing
could
be
--
it
could
be
more
than
avoided
by
(voice
overlap)
other
deputies
take
care
of
the
jury
and
these
deputies,
respective
witness
deputies
do
other
duties
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
it
is
a
matter
of
fact.
this
whole
problem
could
have
been
(voice
overlap)
in
the
small
county
where
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
entire
testimony
of
both
of
these
deputy
sheriffs
in
its
printed
record?
justice
potter
stewart
you
told
us
there
was
a
--
as
i
understood
you
that
there
was
no
conflict
at
all
between
their
testimony
and
that
of
the
defendant.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
stenographer
has
just
see
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
probably
whether
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
problem
is
you
don't
have
to
obviate
even
in
a
small
parish
where
there
are
only
two
deputies
i
should
think.
justice
potter
stewart
except
in
the
rare
case
where
all
the
deputies
are
going
to
be
prosecution
witnesses
and
(voice
overlap)
so
you
can
prove
that
you
could
have
special
deputies.
justice
potter
stewart
while
he
was
out
there
apprehended
pretty
soon
after
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
after
they
admit?
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
after
the
murder
when
these
people
were
apprehended?
justice
potter
stewart
were
there
any
--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
was
there
a
defensive
insanity
interposed
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
was
that
handled?
how
was
that
handled
into
your
practice?
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
judge?
justice
potter
stewart
and
where
--
we're
both
kind
to
--
i
mean
both
periods
of
insanity
it
opposed
here?
justice
potter
stewart
first,
is
inability
to
stand
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
now
it
was
decided
against
him
by
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
on
the
trial
of
the
merits
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
was
it
there
before
the
jury,
the
report
of
this
lunacy
commissioner
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
was
a
relied
witness.
justice
potter
stewart
the
trial
judge
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
defendant?
