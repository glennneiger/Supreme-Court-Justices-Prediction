mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
honorable
chief
justice
and
associates.
i
am
going
to
pass
along
on
the
facts
although
they
may
not
be
completely
at
issue.
there
is
an
attempt
by
the
defense
counsel
to
suggest
the
possibility
of
self
defense
by
a
felon
in
the
perpetration
of
a
crime
by
stating
that
the
attendant
at
the
billing
station
fired
first.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
even
the
transcript
to
the
original
case
or
in
the
transcript
to
the
record
before
this
honorable
court
along
that
point
but
be
that
as
it
may
if
it
was
so,
there
is
no
self
defense
available
to
a
person
in
the
perpetration
of
the
felony.
now
before
we
can
fully
understand
the
mechanics
of
a
small
country
parish,
it
would
probably
be
best
to
describe
it
to
you.
tangipahoa
parish
is
approximately
50
miles
long
and
approximately
12
to
14
miles
wide.
there
are
approximately
12
deputies
to
handle
that
parish.
these
deputies
have
such
various
duties
as
serving
summons,
making
arrests,
keeping
the
peace,
transferring
prisoners
to
angola
from
the
parish
prison,
attending
funerals
as
escorts,
summonsing
jurors,
attending
to
juries.
in
other
words,
their
duties
are
manifest
and
widely
vary.
if
you
would
have
a
crime
which
involved
six
or
eight
deputies
as
witnesses,
it
would
become
an
--
almost
another
impossibility
to
exclude
all
of
those
deputies
who
participated
in
an
investigation
of
the
case
from
--
in
some
manner
coming
into
contact
with
the
jury.
now,
just
as
it
is
a
country
parish
in
that
respect,
so
it
is
with
the
eating
facilities.
our
parish
has
no
facilities
in
the
courthouse
for
feeding
the
jurors.
it
is
necessary
when
the
time
comes
to
eat
for
them
to
repair
to
a
small
restaurant
about
two
miles
west
of
amite.
this
is
usually
done
in
school
buses
or
if
a
school
bus
is
not
available,
several
deputies'
cars
to
escort
them
from
the
courthouse
to
the
eating
facility.
here
again
we're
confronted
with
a
condition
of
circumstance,
either
they
eat
that
way
or
they
don't
eat
and
if
you're
going
to
have
a
three-day
trial
hungry
juries
is
not
a
very
--
a
very
good
jury
to
have
listening
to
the
facts.
it
was
on
one
of
these
excursions
to
the
restaurant
that
the
so-called
separation
of
the
juror
casanova
took
place.
it
is
fully
explained
in
the
transcript
of
the
record
upon
mr.
simmons
how
it
occurred.
he
had
left
to
go
pay
the
check
and
while
he
went
to
pay
the
check,
he
left
the
juror
casanova
in
the
company
of
deputy
rispone
and
another
deputy.
now,
of
course,
defense
counsel
seeks
to
unknowingly
unwittingly
possibly
to
have
a
double
explanation
of
the
separation
of
this
juror.
in
one
instance,
he
says,
he
was
with
rispone
alone
and
in
another
he
said
he
was
with
rispone
and
another
party
which
would
attempt
to
suggest
that
there
was
some
outsider
who
was
present
with
the
deputy
and
the
juror.
now,
while
there
may
be
some
difference
between
the
separation
and
the
seclusion
which
i
agreed
to,
it
is
quoted
in
article
394
of
the
louisiana
criminal
cod,
from
the
moment
of
acceptance
until
the
rendition
of
the
verdict
to
the
entry
of
the
mistrial
that
juror
should
be
kept
under
the
charge
of
an
officer
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
secluded
from
all
outside
communication.
now,
i
think
it's
readily
apparent
what
the
purpose
of
this
article
is.
somewhere
along
the
line,
we
have
to
appoint
someone
who
is
responsible
for
this
jury.
if
it's
not
the
deputy
sheriff
it's
going
to
be
someone
else.
the
duty
of
this
officer
whoever
he
maybe
is
to
see
first
that
that
jury
is
kept
as
intact
as
humanly
and
practically
possible
and
to
also
see
that
no
one
from
the
outside
gets
to
that
jury
to
attempt
to
taint
them.
and
if
those
two
items
are
taken
cared
of
other
deputies,
we
feel
that
no
violation
of
rights
has
taken
place.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
other
than
the
deputy?
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
that
would
be
an
outside
influence.
yes
sir.
now
the
mere
fact
that
--
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
i
don't
think
it
matters.
in
other
words,
either
you're
an
outside
influence
or
you
are
within
the
group,
if
he
is
within
the
group
provided
by
law
to
protect
that
jury
and
to
take
care
of
that
jury,
he
is
not
an
outsider.
now
the
next
problem
that
would
arise
from
your
question
would
be
now,
if
that
occurred
what
effect
would
it
have?
in
other
words,
if
you
had
a
deputy
who
was
a
witness
then
what
would
be
the
legal
effect
or
legal
presumption
which
would
arise
from
that
very
fact?
but
if
--
but
that
in
itself
would
not
be
a
separation
of
juror
or
--
nor
would
it
violate
the
seclusion
rule.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
yes,
when
you
use
the
word
mingle
you
go
a
lot
further
than
what
has
transpired
(inaudible)
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
no
sir,
that
would
not
be
a
violation,
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
yes,
not
only
that,
i
am
backed
up
by
federal
decisions
and
by
several
decisions
of
my
state
court
down
to
that
effect
that
it
is
not
such
a
violation.
now,
--
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
62,000.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
yes
sir.
now,
the
parish
has
one,
two,
three,
four
fair
sized
cities
in
it.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
four
fair
sized
cities
in
it.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
the
biggest
of
which
is
hammond
and
then
they
are
separated,
one
to
the
south
by
five
miles
to
the
north
17
miles
which
is
amite,
the
county
seat
and
then
kentwood
about
four
miles
above
that.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
ponchatoula
is
five
miles
south
to
hammond.
i
see
you've
been
in
there.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
it's
small
in
one
way
but
t
is
wide
as
far
as
the
range
of
the
deputies
is
concerned,
the
demands
that
it
creates
upon
them.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
approximately
yes
sir.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
they're
there
from
time
to
time.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
of
course
you
do
understand
that
our
officers
have
no
control
over
the
matter
in
which
the
sheriff
handles
the
--
his
portion
of
the
trial.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
now,
at
this
time,
i'd
like
to
take
up
the
question
of
the
so-called
confession
or
statements.
under
louisiana
law
before
a
statement
can
be
introduced
into
evidence,
it
has
to
first
be
tried
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
to
find
that
it
was
freely
and
voluntarily
given.
and
after
that,
if
the
judge
feels
that
it
is
freely
and
voluntarily
given
and
that
same
testimony
is
given
again
before
the
jury.
in
the
particular
timing,
insofar
as
the
evidence
before
the
judge
alone
is
concerned,
the
defendant
may
take
the
witness
stand
for
the
limited
purpose
of
giving
his
statement
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
the
statement
was
voluntary.
now,
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
to
mr.
turner's
statement
with
regard
to
the
confession.
on
page
50
of
the
transcript
the
court
questioned
the
defendant
mr.
turner.
question:
mr.
turner
did
deputy
simmons
make
any
promises
to
you
for
awards
or
benefits
in
connection
with
you
giving
your
side
of
statement?
answer:
no
sir.
question:
did
he
threaten
you
in
any
way?
no
sir.
question:
was
the
statement
given
under
conditions
which
might
be
conducive
in
placing
you
in
a
position
of
fear
or
apprehension
for
your
safety?
no
sir,
i
could
not
say
that.
by
the
court
that
is
all.
now,
gentlemen,
one
of
the
theories
that
may
arrived
from
the
very
fact
that
if
a
witness
for
a
state
is
also
tendering
to
the
cast
of
the
jury
that
they
might
arise
an
occasion
whereby
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
himself
and
this
so-called
witness
for
the
state
might
be
at
variance.
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
you
in
this
case
there
is
no
variance
between
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
and
the
witness
for
the
state.
the
defendant
in
his
own
words
through
the
questioning
of
the
judge
showed
that
the
taking
of
the
test
of
the
statement,
the
signing
of
the
confession
was
done
freely
and
voluntary.
and
the
judge
so
ruled.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
he
admit
he
(voice
overlap)
he
said
he
hadn't
had
anything
to
eat
for
48
hours.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
now
that
wasn't
--
that
wasn't
because
he
was
on
bread
and
water,
it
was
because
he
just
didn't
eat.
in
other
words,
he
wasn't
kept
from
food.
there
wasn't
any
--
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
or
if
he
had
when
the
court
questioned
him
there
without
having
the
prosecution
able
to
get
hold
of
him
at
that
time.
he
was
so
sick.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
approximately
how
long
had
it
been
since
you
had
slept.
the
same
amount
on
page
48.
i'm
sorry,
it
was
the
--
he
had
not
eaten
or
slept
for
48.
at
the
time
he
was
taken,
how
long
had
it
been
since
you
had
eaten
anything?
approximately
48
hours.
approximately
how
long
had
it
been
since
you
had
slept?
the
same
amount,
48
hours.
had
you
been
separated
from
your
wife?
sure.
now,
one
--
one
thing
they
don't
want
to
forward
that
now.
he
was
not
in
the
custody
of
the
sheriff
for
that
48
hours.
he
had
--
he
had
come
into
hammond
hungry.
the
fact
of
the
thing
is
the
--
those
two
sentences
on
that
page
is
what
cause
this
whole
thing.
when
he
came
into
hammond
he
was
hungry
and
broke
and
he
and
his
wife
decided
they
were
going
to
find
a
place
to
stick
it
up
and
get
something
to
eat,
and
in
the
process
killed
this
service
station
attendant.
and
when
they
were
found,
they
were
found
several
miles
southeast
of
hammond
in
a
car
trying
to
get
away
with
it,
running
to
a
ditch
and
were
caught
and
they
were
brought
up
and
it
mean
that
they
had
not
been
in
the
custody
of
a
sheriff
more
than
two
hours
or
three
hours
when
this
statement
was
stated.
now,
another
thing
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
not
in
their
testimony,
no
sir,
but
the
testimony
which
apparently
was
deemed
that
testimony
which
was
necessary.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
no
sir.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
and
of
course
i
do
have
(voice
overlap)
i
do
have
to
point
this
out
however
that
the
only
time
that
the
defendant
took
the
witness
stand
was
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
he
did
not
take
the
witness
stand
for
full
cross
examination
in
the
case
which
was
of
course
his
constitutional
rights.
now
one
thing
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
to
you
if
--
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
no
sir,
it's
not
here.
it's
in
the
--
apparently
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana
or
did
they
send
the
complete
record
of
it.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
yes
sir.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
surely
can.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
yes
sir.
now,
another
thing
i
would
like
to
point
out
and
that
is
this
when
this
objection
was
first
made
that
there
might
have
been
some
hanky
panky
going
on
insofar
as
the
deputy
was
concerned,
the
witnesses
and
the
jurors.
the
court
in
an
abundance
of
caution
on
page
27
of
the
transcript
said
this,
i
think
in
view
of
the
motion,
that
was
the
motion
for
the
new
trial
presented
by
defense
counsel
pierson,
i
think
it
is
necessary
that
deputy
rispone
be
questioned
on
that
point.
i
would
suggest
that
in
view
of
the
fact
if
you
made
the
motion
mr.
pierson
that
if
there
is
any
information
that
should
be
elicited
that
you
cross-examined
deputy
rispone.
and
he
was
cross-examined
as
completely
as
defense
counsel
decide
and
the
only
evidence
it
could
be
elicited
from
that
witness
was
this,
have
you
spoken
at
any
time
during
the
course
of
the
trial
to
any
of
the
jurors
about
anything?
answer:
yes
i
have.
in
connection
with
providing
for
their
needs,
seeing
that
they
were
comfortable
showing
on
when
to
go
into
the
jury
room
et
cetera.
yes.
mr.
pierson,
i
rest.
now,
i
want
to
point
out
to
you
honorable
justices
it
was
this
witness
who
had
supposedly
violated
his
oath
as
a
deputy
who
was
in
the
process
of
upsetting
the
scales
of
justice
who
was
supposed
to
be
carrying
on
in
all
sorts
of
matters
with
this
jury.
it
was
this
witness
on
the
witness
stand
subject
to
the
cross
examination
of
the
defense
counsel.
if
there
was
anything
the
defense
counsel
wants
to
know
besides
what
he
got,
it
was
still
his
privilege
to
get
it
from
that
witness
and
no
other
wit
--
no
other
testimony
came
there
from
nor
was
it
possible
because
there
was
no
such
thing.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
i
believe
that
we're
confronted
with
two
possible
constitutional
issues.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
i
have
no
explanation
for
this
sir
(voice
overlap)
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
well
--
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
well
--
i
may
have
an
answer
for
it.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
i
say
i
may
have
an
answer
for
it.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
i
say
i
may
have
an
answer
for
it.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
i've
been
assistant
district
attorney
for
10
years
and
there
are
many
times
that
i
practiced
before
the
court
that
i
don't
even
see
defendants
and
witnesses
had
come
there.
and
they'll
have
to
meet
me
on
the
streets
say
“i
saw
you
in
court
this
morning,”
and
talk
to
you
about
it.
in
other
words
we
make
acquaintances
and
sometimes
we
make
friends
and
sometimes
we
make
bad
impressions
without
actually
ever
coming
into
close
contact
with
people.
now,
that
may
have
been
--
that's
the
only
logical
explanation
that
i
can
suggest
to
it
because
i
don't
believe
there's
any
--
there
was
any
--
perhaps
you
would
know
for
both
the
player
and
i
didn't
think
like
that
going
on
back
there.
i
don't
--
or
do
i
think
there
was
any
possibility
of
suggesting
fishing
trips
or
anything.now
that's
my
answer
to
that.
so
apparently
we
have
two
constitutional
issues.
one,
whether
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
louisiana
was
violated
and
of
course
i
think
that
particular
category
i
think
the
state
of
louisiana
has
the
best
judge
insofar
as
it's
state
constitution
is
concerned.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
no
sir.
but
i
just
say
a
little
possibility
of
two.
now
for
that
what
i
do
want
to
point
out
however
is
this.
if
the
state
of
louisiana
cannot
pass
on
its
own
constitutionality
and
say
that
acts
performed
within
it's
jurisdiction
of
constitution
and
how
can
the
state
of
wisconsin
or
the
state
of
illinois'
have
a
decision
which
will
have
the
effect
of
overriding
a
decision
of
the
state
supreme
court
of
louisiana
which
is
in
effect
what
is
going
to
be
done
here.
if
the
shermer
case
is
(voice
overlap).
now,
under
the
question
of
the
--
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
sorry.
under
the
federal
issues
now,
we
have
chambers
--
chambers
versus
u.s.
237
federal
513
wherein
the
court
said
that
the
matter
was
not
reviewable
by
a
federal
appeals
court
and
that
the
matter
similar
to
this
was
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge.
now,
the
cases
that
were
cited
--
the
little
case
is
a
very
good
reason
why
that
case
was
overruled.
though
the
stenographer
and
the
jury
room
that's
absolutely
forbidden.
that's
an
outsider,
no
question
in
the
world
about
that.
no
outsider
can
be
--
and
i
can't
be
in
there.
and
no
any
witness,
and
that
stenographer
was
a
witness.
in
the
sutherland
case,
the
witness,
witness
talked
with
the
juror
about
the
case.
now,
i
cannot
conceive
of
any
situation
wherein
a
witness
could
get
to
a
juror
unless
that
witness
was
allowed
to
separate.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
his
badge?
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
personally
i
don't
see
it.
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
it.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
oh,
but
now
wait
just
a
minute.
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
a
witness
inside
the
jury
room
during
the
deliberations.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
to
talk
with
the
--
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
oh
no
--
no.
the
case
didn't
say
that.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
alright.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
because
then
he
would
be
an
outsider
in
the
segment.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
because
article
394
of
the
louisiana
criminal
code
says
one
is
correct
and
the
other
is
incorrect.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
mr.
justice
because
when
i
came
up
here,
yes,
that
it'd
be
sworn
and
there
was
a
certain
fellow
who've
had
a
job,
they
do
stood
right
behind
me.
it's
just
--
in
other
words,
there
are
rules
and
regulations
in
everything
you
do
that
have
to
be
--
have
to
be
reported
to
and
if
he
kept
in
contact
with
there
is
no
provision
there
for
a
witness
having
anything
to
do
with
a
jury,
with
the
article
or
the
criminal
code,
article
394
says
it
shall
be
in
the
custody
of
the
sheriff.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
that's
correct,
article
394
of
the
louisiana
criminal
code
which
says
that's
his
duty,
that's
his
job.
and
now
let's
take
this
thing
one
step
further
if
we
take
that
analogy.
let's
say
that
the
deputy
can't
do
it.
then
who's
going
to
take
care
of
the
jury?
in
other
words
we're
going
to
have
somebody
to
take
care
of
the
jury.
and
whoever
takes
care
of
the
jury
is
going
to
be
an
officer
of
the
court
and
we're
just
going
to
pass
that
point
one
step
further.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
well
the
only
thing
is
if
we
had
all
the
deputies,
i
wouldn't
be
here
today.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
in
other
words
i
wouldn't
be
here
today.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
well,
i'll
say
this,
it's
not
impossible
--
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
i
can
say
on
this
particular
case
that
it
was
quite
a
general
law
as
far
as
that
was
concerned.
they
were
deputies
because
for
a
long
term,
i
shouldn't
say
for
a
long
time,
there
was
a
period
of
time
within
which
no
one
knew
who
had
committed
the
crime
and
the
parish
was
being
completely
surveying
for
evidence.
they
did
not
been
into
listing
for
getting
in
the
court
in
a
ditch
being
stuck.
i
wouldn't
be
here
either
because
even
that
they
haven't
thought.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
that's
right.
now
in
the
matter
--
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
oh,
within
8
to
10
hours.
it
was
committed
in
the
middle
of
the
morning.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
pardon
me
--
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
yes
sir.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
we
have
a
group
of
three
doctors
appointed
to
take
approximately
30
days
within
which
to
review
the
conditions
of
the
defendants'
sanity
both
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime
and
as
of
present
and
then
that
commission
or
that
insanity
commission
reports
back
to
the
court
its
findings
and
try
to
go
into
trial
on
the
merits,
the
defense
is
allowed
to
present
that
and
had
that
issue
passed
upon
for
them
to
trial
on
there.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
by
the
judge,
yes.
now
that
then
support
his
present
sanity
is
concerned.
in
other
words
to
find
out
whether
he's
able
to
represent
himself
and
to
--
could
cooperate
with
his
counsel.
now
the
question
of
insanity
insofar
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime
is
a
matter
of
fact
to
be
weighed
by
the
jury
in
itself.
that
cannot
be
handled
in
advance
but
all
those
safeguards
will
go
into
then
as
far
as
this
defendant
is
concerned.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
yes
sir.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
that's
correct.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
that
was
decided
against
him
by
the
trial
judge.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
the
jury
decides
against
him
on
the
question
of
insanity
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
yes
sir.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
not
only,
not
--
no
way,
not
only
the
report
of
that
commission
but
the
members
of
the
commission
have
presented
to
the
jury
and
the
judge
questions
them
and
the
defense
counsel
is
allowed
to
cross-examine
and
in
addition
to
that
if
there's
any
question
in
his
mind
from
the
time
he
gets
that
report,
and
he
gets
that
report
before
he
goes
to
trial.
if
there's
any
question
in
his
own
mind
he
has
the
right
to
call
his
own
alliances
to
attempt
to
disprove
what
the
commission
says.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
no
--
no,
it's
the
defense
counsel.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
yes,
the
defendant.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
that's
correct
sir.
twice
(voice
overlap)
on
adjudication.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
well
if
the
deputy
isn't
there
they
need
separation.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
yes
sir.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
(voice
overlap)
law,
they
are
27
years
and
that
was
the
custom
when
i
came
there.
it
was
there
40
years
before
i
came.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
yes
sir.
now
there
is
a
private
dining
room
there
for
it.
in
other
words
they
don't
--
they
don't
eat
out
in
the
front
with
all
of
the
other
--
all
the
other
customers.
now,
it's
a
private
dining
hall
and
they're
taken
back
in
that
private
dining
hall
and
they're
in
the
custody
of
more
than
one
deputy.
there's
no
possibility
there
then.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
i
would
--
i
would
mention
to
say
that
that's
a
matter
of
common
practice.
although
--
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
yes
sir.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
well
now,
particularly
in
those
parishes
where
the
eating
facilities
are
not
available
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
room
they
say.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
it
maybe
bad
but
i
just
wonder
how
it
can
be
avoided.
in
closing
then
it
appears
that
the
federal
cases
established
almost
the
same
rule
that
has
been
established
here.
and
that
is
that
if
this
matter
occurs
a
presumption
may
arise
but
that
is
a
rebuttable
presumption,
and
that
if
evidence
is
introduced
to
rebut
it
then
it
ceases
to
be
at
any
consequential.
mr.
leonard
e.
yokum
did
i
understand
that
you
wished
the
complete
transcript
sent
to
you?
