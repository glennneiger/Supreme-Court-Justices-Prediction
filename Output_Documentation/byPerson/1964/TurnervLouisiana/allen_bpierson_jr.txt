mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
and
members
of
the
court.
the
facts
surrounding
this
case
are
painfully
clear
and
simple.
it
involves
a
felony
murder
case
from
the
state
of
louisiana.
the
murder
occurred
during
the
commission
of
an
armed
robbery
on
october
7,
1960.
the
facts
are
that
the
accused
below,
wayne
turner,
arrived
at
hammond,
louisiana,
hungry
and
broke.
during
the
armed
robbery
of
a
phillips
66
service
station,
the
attendant
at
the
station
drew
a
38
caliber
revolver
from
his
pocket
and
began
shooting.
turner
shot
back
and
of
course
the
attendant
was
killed
almost
instantly.
turner
and
his
wife
both
confessed
to
the
murder
the
following
day.
both
were
indicted.
the
wife
was
allowed
to
plead
guilty
to
manslaughter
and
is
now
out
on
probation.
the
trial
of
wayne
turner
lasted
three
days
in
the
21st
judicial
district
court
of
the
parish
of
tangipahoa,
state
of
louisiana.
this
is
the
district
or
trial
court
in
the
state.
during
these
three
days,
the
petty
jury
consisting
of
12
men
was
in
the
custody
of
among
other
deputies
or
bailiffs,
deputies
rispone
and
chief
criminal
deputy
hulon
simmons.
now,
deputy
rispone
and
deputy
simmons
were
both
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
in
the
trial
of
this
case.
deputy
rispone
testified
that
he
was
the
first
to
arrive
at
the
scene
of
the
crime,
that
he
made
the
official
investigation
and
report.
he
further
testified
that
he
heard
wayne
turner
admit
to
having
committed
the
crime.
he
further
testified
that
wayne
turner
had
led
him
to
the
site
of
certain
incriminating
evidence
consisting
of
a
murder
weapon
and
certain
identification
cards
belonging
to
turner.
rispone
also
testified
in
connection
with
establishing
the
chain
of
evidence.
deputy
hulon
simmons
testified
that
he
had
received
the
confession
which
was
allegedly
free
and
voluntarily
given.
this
is
a
written
confession.
in
addition,
deputy
simmons
testified
as
to
the
chain
of
evidence
and
as
to
certain
admissions
made
by
turner
of
his
guilt.
a
motion
for
mistrial
and
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
were
both
overruled
and
this
court
after
an
adverse
decision
from
the
state
supreme
court
of
louisiana
granted
certiorari.
both
the
motion
for
mistrial
and
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
were
based
basically
on
the
fact
that
these
bailiffs
are
deputies
or
chief
prosecution
witnesses
but
not
only
that
that
during
the
course
of
this
trial,
these
witnesses
had
mingled
with,
had
fraternized
with,
had
become
a
part
of
and
identified
with
the
petty
jury.
in
other
words
that
they
had
conducted
themselves
in
such
a
way
not
to
shield
the
jury
from
outside
communication
but
had
actually
communicated
unnecessarily
and
visited
with
the
jury
unnecessarily
themselves.
the
basic
issue
before
this
court
is
we
believe
one
of
constitutional
importance
and
that
is
does
the
accused
in
a
capital
case
especially
in
a
capital
case
have
a
right
to
a
trial
by
jury
which
is
untainted
with
the
suspicion
of
misconduct
or
must
the
accused
go
further
and
actually
proved
prejudice
or
misconduct
that
these
things
did
happen
that
the
fraternization
did
take
place
is
on
question.
i
might
point
out
that
the
same
type
of
conduct
also
occurred
in
another
louisiana
case
arising
out
of
the
same
trial
court
which
was
tried
only
months
before
the
turner
case
was
tried.
that
was
the
case
of
state
versus
mcalister
which
is
cited
in
my
brief.
these
things
did
happen.
i
believe
that
the
louisiana
courts
have
failed
to
clearly
distinguish
between
separation
and
seclusion
and
that
this
imparts
the
counts
for
the
error
that
they've
fallen
into.
separation
is
defined
on
page
8
of
respondent's
brief
is
the
physical
separation
of
one
juror
from
another.
seclusion,
however,
means
simply
to
be
cut
off
from
outside
communication.
now,
the
louisiana
statute
in
point
is
revised
statutes
15:394
which
is
set
forth
in
full
in
the
brief.
this
statute
used
the
words
“keep
together.”
what
could
these
words
mean
except
that
the
jury
is
to
be
kept
together
not
to
be
physically
separated.
the
statute
also
uses
the
words
“secluded
from
outside
communication.”
what
could
this
possibly
mean
except
that
the
jury
is
not
to
communicate
unnecessarily
with
members
or
with
anyone
except
its
on
members.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
your
honor,
the
extent
of
the
fraternization
is
set
forth
in
the
printed
record
the
--
it
consists
of
really
three
things.
first
of
all,
there
was
a
separation
of
the
jury
on
approximately
nine
occasions
and
three
separate
automobiles
when
they
were
taken
to
and
returned
from
a
restaurant.
in
addition,
on
of
these
occasions,
one
juror
mr.
paul
casanova
was
separated
alone
from
the
other
jurors.
in
other
words,
it
was
an
11
to
one
separation.
mr.
casanova
was
in
a
company
of
deputies
simmons
and
rispone
on
this
occasion
and
in
the
company
possibly
of
another
unidentified
deputy.
at
page
37
of
the
printed
record,
you
will
note
that
deputy
simmons
testified
that
while
he
was
paying
the
check
at
the
restaurant,
paul
casanova,
the
juror
was
alone
with
deputy
rispone
and/or
some
unidentified
third
person.
we
intend
to
show
and
i
will
develop
it
just
a
little
later
that
under
louisiana
law
itself
this
creates
a
presumption
of
prejudice
and
it's
certainly
under
the
federal
constitution
in
presumption
if
prejudice
arises.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
your
honor,
the
defense
was
not
able
to
prove
by
the
very
nature
of
things
any
actual
misconduct
or
prejudice.
however,
the
very
fact
that
mr.
casanova
was
separated
and
was
alone
with
this
deputy
witness
who
was
a
chief
witness
for
the
prosecution
under
the
federal
decisions
in
the
case
a
presumption
of
prejudice
sufficient
to
set
the
verdict
aside.
in
addition
under
the
louisiana
decisions,
a
mere
physical
separation
of
the
jury
raises
a
presumption
or
prejudice
sufficient
to
set
the
verdict
aside.
in
each
of
these
cases,
of
course,
the
state
has
the
opportunity
to
come
in
and
to
prove
that
there
was
no
prejudice.
however,
i
will
--
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
they
cannot
then.
they're
not
supreme
court
cases.
the
case
that
i've
reference
to
is
the
case
of
little
versus
the
united
states
in
which
the
court
there
said
that
it
raises
great
considerations
as
to
whether
the
defendant
has
been
denied
its
rights
under
the
bill
of
rights.
also
important
is
the
maddox
case,
excuse
me,
the
morin
case
which
was
a
federal
district
court
case.
in
that
case,
there
was
involved
the
prosecution
of
a
railroad
baggage
agent
for
possession
of
stolen
property.
once
it
was
shown
at
the
prosecution
witness,
who
incidentally
was
a
very
minor
and
unimportant
prosecution
witness
had
had
lunch
with
the
juror
and
just
had
general
social
intercourse
wherein
the
court
says
--
said
that
this
is
sufficient
to
initiate
the
verdict.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
yes
sir.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
i
believe
--
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
sir
whether
you
are
referring
to
the
admission
or
to
the
written
confession.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
well,
yes
sir.
the
louisiana
law
requires
that
confessions
or
admissions
in
order
to
be
admissible
must
be
proven
as
voluntary,
voluntary
given.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
yes
sir,
we
did
challenge
voluntariness.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
it
was
given
by
chief
criminal
deputy
hulon
simmons.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
yes
sir.
this
--
he's
one
of
the
gentlemen
and
incidentally
this
is
the
same
--
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
he
testified
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
on
--
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
on
voluntariness.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
yes
sir,
very
definitely.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
the
court
would
not
allow
him
to
testify
before
the
jury
on
that
limited
point.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
not
before
the
jury.
no
sir.
in
the
state
case
of
state
versus
hornsby,
the
court
was
dealing
with
a
physical
separation
and
said,
“in
tampa,
cases
upon
a
separation,
misconduct
and
abuse
will
always
be
presumed.”
certainly
in
the
instant
case,
there
was
a
separation
on
at
least
nine
occasions
traveling
to
and
from
the
restaurant.
on
one
of
these
occasions
there
was
an
11
to
one
separation
and
mr.
casanova
was
in
the
company
of
deputy
respone
later
joined
by
deputy
simmons
both
bailiffs,
both
witnesses
for
the
prosecution.
it
is
not
every
separation
of
course
which
will
be
sufficient
to
set
aside
the
verdict.
what
i'm
really
saying
is
that
the
state
in
some
cases
is
successful
in
proving
that
there
was
no
prejudice.
for
example,
in
state
versus
smith,
a
case
involving
12
jurors
filing
through
a
door,
the
door
blew
shut
just
before
the
12
juror
made
it
through.
he
opened
the
door.
this
was
an
accidental
and
momentary
separation.
obviously
there
was
no
prejudice.
obviously,
the
verdict
was
not
set
aside.
it's
precisely
into
this
niche
in
the
law
that
three
of
the
four
cases
cited
by
respondents
fit
and
that
is
the
state
versus
sharbino.
one
juror
remained
in
the
jury
room
as
the
other
11
filed
into
the
courtroom.
the
court
immediately
sent
the
11
back.
they
got
the
missing
juror
and
immediately
filed
back
into
the
courtroom.
this
also
was
a
momentary
and
accidental
separation.
there
was
no
possibility
that
any
of
the
jurors
could
have
been
contacted
during
the
separation,
therefore,
the
verdict
was
not
set
aside.
in
state
versus
fuller,
two
jurors
ate
at
the
same
table
with
an
outsider
in
a
restaurant.
it
later
developed
that
the
outsider
had
been
a
member
of
the
grand
jury
which
had
indicted
the
man
being
tried.
the
verdict
was
not
set
aside
because
the
court
found
positively
that
there
was
no
prejudice.
but
even
here,
the
presumption
arose
because
there
had
been
a
separation.
in
state
versus
davis
and
other
louisiana
case,
also
cited
by
respondents,
the
jury
was
accorded
in
five
rooms
n
a
hotel
suite.
the
rooms
were
accessible
only
through
the
room
in
which
the
deputy
sheriff
slept.
the
deputy
in
this
case
was
not
a
witness.
therefore,
even
though
there
was
a
separation,
because
obviously,
they
were
separated
into
five
different
rooms,
the
court
did
not
overturn
the
verdict
because
there
had
been
no
breach
of
the
seclusion
of
the
jury.
the
jury
could
not
possibly
have
been
contacted
by
an
outside,
a
person
or
persons.
it
is
interesting
to
note
also
in
the
davis
case
that
the
deputy
slept
in
a
separate
room.
the
deputy
did
not
mingle
with
and
fraternized
with
the
jury.
the
instant
case
is
not
analogous
to
those
cases
because
the
separation
was
not
momentary.
it
was
not
accidental.
certainly
after
the
mcallister
case,
only
a
few
months
before
this
case,
in
the
same
court,
involving
the
same
sheriff's
office
and
involving
the
same
chief
criminal
deputy
hulon
simmons
who
had
been
questioned
at
length
on
this
question
in
the
mcallister
case.
certainly,
it
was
not
accidental.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
yes
sir,
very
definitely.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
the
procedure
in
louisiana
as
i
understand
it
is
that
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury,
the
judge
will
hear
the
testimony
bearing
on
whether
or
not
the
confession
was
voluntary.
he
will
then
pass
upon
the
permissibility
and
the
evidence
will
be
represented
to
the
jury
in
order
that
they
may
give
the
confession
on
what
weight
they
desire,
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
yes.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
we
were
not
allowed
to
do
it
before
the
jury
your
honor
because
we
--
the
court
would
not
allow
us
to
place
the
defendant
on
the
stand
for
this
limited
point
before
the
jury.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
oh
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
yes
sir
very
definitely.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
that's
right.
we
certainly
did.
there
was
some
question.
the
defendant
testified
that
he
had
not
slept
for
48
hours
prior
to
giving
the
confession.
and
of
course
this
was
of
major
importance
to
whether
or
not
the
confession
was
freely
and
voluntarily
given,
yeah.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
the
questioning
of
the
deputy
was
both
out
and
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
questioning
of
the
defendant
himself
was
simply
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
that
was
the
ruling
of
the
trial
court,
yes
sir.
as
to
the
matter
of
seclusion
of
the
jury
members
from
outside
communication,
the
respondent
has
cited
the
case
of
state
versus
migis.
in
this
case,
the
doctor
entered
the
jury
room
at
night
in
order
to
treat
a
sick
juror.
now,
the
court
said
that
there
was
no
separation
and
there
was
not.
however,
what
the
report
really
should
have
said
was
that
there
was
no
violation
of
the
law
requiring
the
jury
to
be
secluded
because
the
doctor
simply
entered
the
room,
treated
the
juror
and
left.
he
did
not
converse
with
the
other
members
of
the
jury,
swapping
stories
or
telling
jokes,
planning
fishing
trips
or
what
have
you.
he
simply
treated
the
man
and
left.
there
was
no
fraternization,
no
mingling
and
therefore
the
seclusion
of
the
jury
was
not
violated.
in
state
versus
oteri
practically
the
same
circumstances.
only
in
this
case,
instead
of
being
a
doctor,
he
was
a
barber.
but
there
again,
there
was
no
mingling,
no
fraternization,
no
separation
and
therefore
no
violation
of
the
seclusion
requirement
of
the
state
law.
now
i
realized
that
the
law
generally
over
the
united
states
is
that
a
bailiff
simply
because
he
is
a
prosecution
witness
is
not
per
se
precluded
from
acting
his
bailiff.
however,
it
is
the
contention
of
the
petitioners
that
it
is
one
thing
to
be
a
bailiff
and
it
is
quite
another
to
mingle
with
the
jury
and
to
fraternize
with
them
unnecessarily.
certainly,
if
counsel
for
the
defense
or
the
defendant
himself
in
that
trial
or
any
of
the
defendant's
witnesses
had
so
mingled
with
the
jury,
this
would
have
been
grounds
for
a
mistrial
on
the
part
of
the
state.
i
see
the
red
light.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
thank
you
your
honor.
immediately
before
the
recess,
i
was
pointing
out
to
this
honorable
court
that
had
the
defendant
or
his
counsel
or
his
witnesses
fraternized
with
the
jury
to
the
extent
that
the
fraternization
between
the
jury
and
the
state's
witnesses
took
place,
this
would
certainly
have
been
grounds
for
seing
the
--
for
a
mistrial
could
possibly
also
be
grounds
for
contempt
of
court
proceeding
against
the
attorney
who
engaged
in
such
activity.
i
was
also
saying
that
a
witness
who
is
also
a
bailiff
is
not
per
se
disqualified
from
acting
as
bailiff.
ever
being
a
bailiff
is
one
thing
and
being
a
friend
and
acquaintance
and
renewing
this
friendship
and
acquaintanceship
with
the
jury
is
quite
another.
the
mcallister
case
which
i
already
alluded
to
was
tried
in
tangipahoa
parish
in
the
same
court
just
a
few
months
before
the
turner
case.
the
same
objection
was
raised.
the
chief
criminal
deputy
hulon
simmons
was
questioned
along
the
same
line.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
louisiana
court
in
the
mcallister
case
and
while
that
appeal
was
pending,
the
same
misconduct,
the
same
loose
practice
in
handling
the
petty
jury
was
again
allowed
to
take
place
in
the
same
court
by
the
same
men.
i
believe
that
it
is
--
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
yes
sir,
in
the
turner
case.
i
believe
that
this
in
itself
suggests
very
strongly
an
intentional
design
and
a
prejudice
against
the
defendant's
rights.
now,
mere
persons
of
the
bailiff
and
especially
of
a
bailiff
witness
in
a
jury
room
during
the
actual
deliberations
is
always
to
my
knowledge
been
held
as
grounds
for
reversible
error
and
rightly
so
because
this
prevents
the
free
exchange
of
ideas
among
the
jury
members.
however,
in
the
instant
case,
we
do
not
know,
i
don't
suppose
there
was
any
that
rispone
and
simmons
were
actually
in
the
jury
room
during
the
deliberations.
it
is
on
this
basis
that
the
louisiana
supreme
court
distinguished
the
case
of
tarkington
versus
state.
it
was
a
mississippi
case
17
southern
768.
there's
another
case,
a
very
similar,
and
that
is
shermer
versus
the
state,
260
wisconsin
510
51
northwest
2d.47
a
1952
wisconsin
case.
in
that
case,
after
the
final
charge
was
given
by
the
judge
and
the
case
was
in
the
jury's
hands,
the
jury
was
taken
out
to
supper
before
they
actually
began
the
deliberations.
it
was
during
this
time
that
the
bailiff
who
had
been
an
important
witness
in
the
case
simply
set
at
one
of
the
tables
with
some
of
the
jurors
while
they
ate.
there
was
no
contention,
no
allegation
that
he
was
in
the
jury
room
while
the
deliberations
were
actually
taking
place.
the
court
in
the
shermer
case
set
the
verdict
aside
and
i'd
like
to
quote
briefly
from
its
opinion
where
the
opinion
in
criminal
trials,
the
officers
of
the
state
who
were
actively
engaged
in
the
prosecution
in
furtherance
of
their
official
duties
as
were
simmons
and
rispone
in
the
instant
case.
and
who
by
their
activity
and
attitude
indicate
a
part
of
an
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
case,
must
be
held
to
represent
the
state
in
the
trial
and
that
their
conduct
so
far
as
it
relates
to
the
jury
must
be
regarded
as
a
conduct
of
the
opposite
party.
and
so
it
should
have
been
in
this
case.
simmons
and
rispone
were
very
actively
identified
in
the
prosecution
of
the
state's
case.
both
were
witnesses
for
the
state,
important
witnesses
and
both
testified
before
the
jury.
that
they
were
prejudiced
possibly
not
intentionally
so
to
the
extent
of
intentionally
falsifying
their
testimony
but
that
they
did
have
certain
feelings
as
it
was
brought
out
by
the
testimony
of
deputy
simmons
on
page
35
of
the
record
where
he
was
challenged
by
defense
counsel
on
his
use
of
the
term
hitting
the
evidence.
in
fact
the
evidence
was
not
hidden
at
all,
it
had
simply
had
been
thrown
on
the
ground
over
a
wide
area.
it
is
such
thing
as
this
that
color
a
witness'
testimony
that
the
jury
must
past
on.
the
jury
must
pass
on
the
credibility.
the
federal
view
has
long
been
that
prejudice
will
be
presumed
in
cases
where
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
requirement
that
the
jury
be
secluded
from
outside
communication,
thus,
in
united
states
versus
morin,
the
case
that
i
already
alluded
to
in
the
prosecution
of
a
railroad
baggage
man
for
possession
of
stolen
property.
the
conviction
was
set
aside
because
the
juror
had
communicated
on
a
friendly
basis
with
the
government
witness.
it
was
not
proven
that
the
case
had
been
discussed
though
the
court
did
suspicion
that
it
had.
but
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
even
so,
this
raises
great
access
to
the
--
whether
or
not
the
defendant
has
had
a
fair
trial.
the
same
is
true
in
the
case
of
wheaton
versus
the
united
states
where
the
bailiff
actually
helped
the
jury
in
the
mechanics
of
the
voting
procedure.
here
again
the
verdict
was
set
aside
or
no
--
excuse
me,
i
believe
in
this
case
it
was
remanded
for
a
hearing
as
to
whether
or
not
the
accused
had
actually
been
prejudiced.
in
the
case
of
little
versus
the
united
states,
the
stenographer
read
to
the
jury
from
her
shorthand
notes
the
charge
or
part
of
the
charge
of
the
judge.
certainly,
the
scenario
for
which
reading
only
what
the
judge
had
already
told
the
jury,
it's
a
little
difficult
to
see
prejudice
but
the
conviction
was
struck
down
on
the
grounds
that
the
court
did
not
know
what
have
actually
transpired
in
the
jury
room
and
that
perhaps
the
stenographer
put
emphasis
on
the
wrong
words
or
made
a
shorthand
character.
for
this
reason,
the
defendant's
rights
to
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
have
been
violated.
the
respondent
in
his
brief
approves
the
matters
overlying
the
little
decisions
which
says
that
the
facts
here
are
different.
certainly
they
are
different
as
to
the
basic
facts
in
the
case,
and
yet
as
to
the
rationale
of
the
decisions,
i
see
a
very
little
difference
of
it
any
at
all.
they
are
all
based
on
unauthorized
and
unnecessary
communication
between
petty
jurors
and
third
persons
and
in
some
cases
third
persons
who
are
witnesses
which
is
our
case
here
today.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
your
honor.
i
didn't
--
i
can't
recall
the
case
to
mind
at
the
present
time.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
no
sir
i
don't
have
it.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
three
full
days
your
honor.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
yes
sir
under
louisiana
law,
the
jury
in
a
capital
case
is
not
allowed
to
separate.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
other
deputies
who
were
not
witnesses
on
the
prosecution
have
really
mingled
in
and
out
with
the
jury
also.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
the
defense
counsel
has
no
way
of
knowing.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
no
sir,
it
was
the
--
actually
the
deputies
in
charged
with
the
jury
were
in
a
change
it
will
and
during
the
recesses,
there
may
be
several
deputies
there
sitting
in
the
room
with
the
jury.
what
we're
complaining
of
actually
is
not
so
much
the
fact
that
the
witnesses
were
also
bailiffs
with
the
fact
that
these
gentlemen
mingled
with
the
jury
unnecessarily.
deputy
simmons
at
page
36
and
37
of
the
record
admits
that
he
renewed
all
acquaintances
and
made
new
friends
with
the
jury
during
the
time
that
the
trial
was
in
progress.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
the
weight
of
opinion
is
against
that
position
sir.
that's
--
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
and
i
still
think
that
that
position
should
be
maintained.
i
think
it's
terribly
a
loose
practice
to
allow
a
witness
to
act
as
a
bailiff.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
that
their
was
certainly
unnecessary
mingling,
unnecessary
separation.
and
that
on
one
occasion,
when
mr.
casanova
was
in
the
company
of
deputy
rispone
alone
we
don't
know
what
happened.
we
can
only
guess
and
under
the
facts,
right
under
the
law,
it
would
appear
that
this
would
in
itself
call
for
a
reversal
of
the
decision
because
the
state
has
not
shown
that
there
was
in
fact
no
prejudice
to
the
accused.
now
under
--
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
that's
correct.
actually,
defense
counsel
did
not
realized
it
until
we
saw
juror
casanova
alone
with
deputy
rispone
and
it
was
after
this
when
rispone
was
called
to
testify
and
the
judgment
was
again
renewed
when
simmons
was
called
to
testify
that
we
did
asked
for
mistrialed.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
yes
sir,
the
same
motion
was
renewed
and
again
overruled.
the
only
attempt
made
by
the
state
to
show
that
there
was
no
separation
or
rather
more
specifically
if
we
differentiate
between
separation
and
seclusion
that
there
was
no
violation
of
the
seclusion
so
as
to
prejudice
the
defendant
was
the
testimony
of
deputy
simmons
who
testified
that
he
had
not
discussed
the
case
with
any
juror.
and
that
he
had
not
heard
deputy
rispone
discuss
the
case
with
any
juror.
however,
deputy
simmons'
own
testimony
at
page
37
of
the
record
places
one
juror
alone
with
deputy
rispone
who
was
the
witness.
deputy
simmons
is
obviously
unqualified
to
tell
what
happened
on
that
occasion.
the
only
attempt
made
with
reference
to
deputy
rispone
was
his
testimony
that
during
the
ride
back
from
ardiles
restaurant
he
did
not
discuss
the
case
with
juror
casanova
but
what
did
he
discussed,
the
record
does
not
disclose
that.
he
possibly
could
have
discussed
some
other
case,
possibly
he
discussed
the
crime
rate
in
general,
possibly
he
discussed
getting
together
later
with
juror
casanova
for
a
fishing
trip.
this
was
an
unnecessary
fraternization.
it
was
an
unnecessary
opportunity
for
a
juror
to
be
reached
and
not
reached
intentionally
but
reached
more
subtly.
just
by
the
developing
of
a
bond
of
friendship,
a
rapport
between
the
two
men.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
he
was
and
the
answer
was
rather
vague
to
the
extent
that
i
don't
know
but
i
know
it
wasn't
about
the
case,
that
sort
of
an
answer
your
honor.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
not
that
i
know
of
sir.
it
could
very
well
be.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
two.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
yes
sir,
the
mcallister
case
just
several
months
before
the
turner
case.
i
might
point
out
that
there
is
an
1856
louisiana
decision
entitled,
let's
see,
state
versus
judge
of
the
ninth
judicial
district
court
pointe
coupee
parish
which
is
cited.
this
was
a
civil
litigation
in
which
the
sheriff
was
a
necessary
party
to
his
wife's
action
under
the
peculiarities
of
the
louisiana
common
law
or
rather
community
property
law,
excuse
me.
the
court,
the
appellate
court
said
that
the
sheriff
could
perform
a
ministerial
duties
of
selecting
the
jury
venire
having
the
summons
that
served
but
that
it
would
not
be
becoming
for
him
to
take
charge
of
the
jury
during
the
trial.
we
believe
it's
not
becoming
in
this
case
for
these
witnesses
to
take
charge
of
this
jury
especially
to
take
charge
of
and
to
associate
and
mingle
with
them
to
this
extent.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
yes
sir,
the
deputy
sheriff
sanctioned.
he
served
a
summons
on
each
member
of
the
jury
venire.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
no
sir,
the
venire
(voice
overlap)
well,
the
normal
regular
venire
is
selected
by
a
jury
commission.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
and
i
believe
that
the
special
venires
are
also
or
--
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
they
are.
i'd
like
to
point
out
for
the
court's
special
attention
the
case
of
state
versus
woods
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs
and
i
quoted
from
it
at
length.
that
case
is
one
from
the
state
of
indiana.
it's
a
leading
case
in
indiana
and
it's
practically
on
all
force
with
the
case
at
bar.
in
that
case,
the
deputy
sheriffs,
both
witnesses
and
non-witnesses
were
allowed
to
mingle
with
the
jury
during
the
progress
of
the
trial.
there
was
no
question
that
this
had
happens
just
as
there's
no
question
that
it
happened
in
the
instant
case.
there
was
no
attempt
to
say
that
this
happened
only
during
the
deliberations
of
the
jury
that
happened
only
during
the
course
of
the
trial.
interestingly
enough,
it
was
not
a
capital
case.
the
highest
court
in
indiana
struck
down
the
conviction
and
i've
quoted
from
that
case
at
length
in
my
brief.
i
don't
think
that
it's
necessary
to
reread
that
but
the
court
simply
said
that
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
defendant
can
prove
any
actual
misconduct,
in
the
actual
prejudice
to
his
cause,
the
mere
fact
that
this
thing
happened
unnecessarily
is
presumption
enough
and
calls
for
a
new
trial
on
constitutional
grounds.
i
don't
think
they
used
the
word
constitutional
but
certainly
this
was
in
the
back
of
their
minds.
in
the
shermer
case
which
is
actually
one
of
those
cases
dealing
with
the
presence
of
the
bailiff
during
the
deliberations
of
the
jury.
the
court
also
struck
down
the
conviction.
however,
i
should
point
out
to
you
that
in
the
shermer
case,
the
bailiff
was
not
in
the
room.
he
did
not
actually
hear
the
deliberations
of
the
jury.
this
was
simply
the
case
where
after
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
the
bailiff
witness
accompanied
the
jury
to
the
restaurant
and
sat
with
them
as
they
ate.
now,
i
see
no
real
distinction
between
that
kind
of
a
case
and
the
case
which
we
have
at
bar
where
the
bailiff
again
accompanies
the
jury
to
the
restaurant
and
sits
with
him
as
deputy
simmons
admittedly
did
on
at
least
two
occasions
because
there
the
jury
is
not
deliberating,
he
is
not
discussing.
they're
simply
being
created
a
bond
of
rapport
of
friendship
between
the
witness
and
the
juror.
it
is
the
intention
of
petitioners
that
the
accused
constitutional
right
to
a
trial
by
an
impartial
jury
has
been
violated.
first
under
state
law
because
a
presumption
arises
when
there
is
a
physical
separation
of
the
jury.
a
presumption
likewise
arises
under
federal
law
when
there
is
an
unnecessary
and
unauthorized
communication
between
the
juror
and
another
witness.
under
the
little
case,
on
the
maddox
case,
on
the
morin
case
which
i
have
already
mentioned,
it
would
appear
that
this
presumption
ought
to
arise
under
state
law
because
these
cases
tend
to
place
it
on
a
constitutional
basis.
the
woods
case
i've
just
quoted
--
cited
to
you
indicates
that
the
presumption
of
prejudice
arising
out
on
such
a
situation
cannot
be
overcome
by
the
state.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
unfortunately
the
prosecuting
attorney
is
correct
that
self
defense
is
not
available
as
a
defense
in
this
case
where
we
would
dispose
that
without
the
trial
in
the
lower
court.
the
--
i
was
very
interested
to
see
that
for
the
most
part,
the
counsel
for
the
respondents
did
not
attempt
to
establish
the
propriety
of
the
action
of
the
sheriff's
office
in
the
mcallister
and
turner
cases,
the
one
we
have
here
today.
but
simply
apologize
for
this
action
on
the
ground
that
there
was
insufficient
manpower,
that
there
was
insufficient
eating
facilities
and
that
things
were
generally
insufficient
all
the
way
around.
even
the
justice
hawthorne
in
delivering
the
opinion
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
in
this
very
case
apologized
for
this
very
action
which
it
could
take
--
which
have
taken
place.
he
says
the
court
is
inclined
to
look
upon
the
practice
of
the
disapproval.
excuse
me,
with
disapproval
however
because
in
such
cases
there
may
be
prejudice
of
a
kind
and
exceedingly
difficult
to
establish.
this
was
the
reason
for
the
holdings
in
the
little
case,
in
the
morin
case
that
the
prejudice,
the
actual
misconduct
would
be
exceedingly
difficult
to
establish
and
that
what's
suspicious
circumstances
had
been
alleged
and
proven
by
the
accused,
this
should
be
enough
to
set
aside
the
verdict.
it's
only
in
a
rare
case
once
such
a
showing
has
been
made
that
the
prosecution
should
be
allowed
to
come
in
and
refuse
a
presumption
by
the
introduction
of
positive
evidence.
it's
the
contention
of
petitioner
in
this
case
that
the
positive
evidence
to
refute
the
presumption
of
justice
is
not
there.
deputy
simmons
testified
on
pages
36
and
37
of
the
printed
record,
he
admits
to
making
new
friends
and
acquaintances.
deputy
rispone
testifies
only
to
the
fact
that
he
did
not
discuss
the
case
with
juror
casanova
on
this
one
instance.
what
did
they
discussed,
the
record
does
not
disclose
it
insofar
as
i
can
tell.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
in
capital
cases,
the
jury
cannot
be
separated
under
louisiana
law.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
capital
cases
only.
in
minor
offenses
the
jury
can
be
permitted
to
separate
at
the
discretion
of
the
court.
in
the
case
of
state
versus
hornsby
which
is
in
all
the
way
down
the
case
i
think
such
court
that
rule
of
law.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
statute,
the
15:394
does
covered
capital
cases.
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
covers
minor
offenses
or
not;
i
am
going
to
check
real
quickly.
it
covers
the
--
it
covers
the
whole
revised
statute
15:394
your
honor.
it
says
that
in
capital
cases,
they
shall
be
kept
together
and
secluded
from
outside
communications
provided
in
cases
not
capital
the
judge
may
have
its
discretion
to
allow
the
jury
to
separate
anytime
before
the
action
was
delivered.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
no
sir.
no
sir,
not
necessarily.
i
would
think
it's
a
very
loose
practice
not
to
keep
them
together
in
the
capital
case
but
i
don't
believe
the
federal
constitution
would
require
that.
what
i
think
the
federal
constitution
requires
is
simply
that
the
accused
not
be
put
to
the
task
of
proving
actual
misconduct,
of
proving
an
actual
evil
intent
or
design
or
actual
prejudice
once
it
has
been
shown
that
the
jury
has
been
allowed
to
associate
on
a
free
and
friendly
basis
with
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
be
their
witness
--
be
their
bailiffs
or
whatever.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
well
sir,
i'm
limiting
the
argument
to
a
capital
case.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
think
that
the
federal
constitution
while
it
may
not
specifically
require
the
jurors
to
be
kept
together
while
it
may
not
specifically.
i'm
not
really
prepared
to
answer
that.
i
think
the
federal
constitution
does
require
that
once
it
has
been
shown
that
there
has
been
a
separation,
that
there
has
been
communication
with
witnesses
unnecessary
communication,
communication
which
could
under
the
facts
have
been
avoided
by
simply
having
some
of
the
other
bailiffs
take
charge
of
the
jury
then
i
think
the
federal
constitution
has
been
trampled
upon.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
specifically
amendment
number
6,
the
part
of
that
amendment
ensuring
the
accused
a
right
to
a
public
and
speedy
trial
by
an
impartial
jury.
i
believe
that
once
the
suspicion
has
been
proven,
that
the
jury
has
possibly
not
been
impartial
either
intentionally
or
unintentionally
even
which
was
certainly
the
holding
of
the
little
case.
then
i
believe
the
accused
is
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
no
sir.
actually,
i'm
arguing
the
case
on
a
dual
ground.
first,
that
since
there
is
a
separation,
a
physical
separation
under
state
law,
hornsby,
the
hornsby
case,
a
presumption
of
prejudice
arises.
and
also
i've
cited
the
federals'
decisions
which
indicate
that
even
without
a
separation
or
whether
there's
a
separation
or
not,
the
fact
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
seclusion
of
the
jury
that
they
have
talked
about
the
case
or
that
has
had
been
on
that
conversation
with
other
people
that
this
is
sufficient.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
no
sir.
i'm
relying
on
the
federal
decisions
which
indicate
that
as
a
constitutional
right
that
the
accused
not
be
put
in
a
position
of
showing
actual
prejudice
or
misconduct
once
the
accused
has
proven
sufficient
facts
and
circumstances
to
create
a
suspicion
in
the
minds
of
the
court.
i
think
this
basically
is
what
we're
arguing
today.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
oh
no
sir,
and
of
course
i
can't
rely
on
that
probable
cause
--
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
oh
no
sir.
no,
i
simply
brought
up
the
state
law
to
acquaint
this
court
with
what
it
is
to
show
that
the
mcallister
and
turner
decisions
are
a
departure
from
that
law.
now,
i
express
my
appreciation
to
the
court
for
having
heard
this
case.
mr.
allen
b.pierson,
jr.
thank
you
your
honor.
i
very
much
appreciate
it.
