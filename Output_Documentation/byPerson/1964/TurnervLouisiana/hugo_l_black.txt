justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
a
statute
on
it
or
is
it
just
a
rule
of
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it's
your
position
--
and
it's
your
position
that
the
federal
constitution
would
require
that
they
would
be
kept
together
whether
the
statute
states
statutes,
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
not
talking
about
the
constitutional
level?
justice
hugo
l.
black
federal
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
federal
constitution
is
violated.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
here,
they're
allowed
to
separate,
you
are
allowed
to
separate
(inaudible),
that
the
burden
is
on
their
case
to
show
that
they
have
nothing
done
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i'd
say
if
the
federal
constitution
act
i'm
not
going
to
limit
myself
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
constitutional
requirement
of
the
capital
case
and
other
cases.
i
don't
find
that
there
needs
to
be
a
constitution.
but
are
you
saying
that
the
federal
constitution
requires
that
that
provides
somewhere
simply
that
we
could
construe
it
anyway
to
have
you
or
to
allow
to
separate
although
the
constitution
doesn't
provide
that
they
must
be
kept
together.
but
they
are
allowed
to
separate
if
they
talk
to
somebody
that
it's
the
duty
of
the
state
to
show
that
they
were
not
prejudiced.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that's
federal
constitution
requires.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
provision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
(inaudible)
of
federal
constitutional
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
relying
on
the
state
law
(voice
overlap)
or
your
federal
constitution
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
(voice
overlap)
ask
you
some
questions.
