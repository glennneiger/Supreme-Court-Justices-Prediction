justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
--
passing
of
the
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
a
question
of
state
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
such
application?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
should
this
court
get
into
this
difficult
constitutional
question
before
us
now?
justice
john
m.
harlan
a
habeas
corpus
if
that's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
question
about
that.
but
i'm
surprised
that
you
said
that
you
didn't
go
that
even
the
serious
--
even
a
taint
constitutional
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
part
of
what
was
discussed
here,
mr.
justice
goldberg's
suggestion
that
he's
not
to
remand
the
case
whether
there's
a
consideration
under
the
statute
and
being
urged
in
the
state
court
directed
the
court
to
get
a
remand
under
the
new
statutes
foreclosing
the
state
court
from
deciding
whether
or
not
under
its
law,
state
law
the
statute
does
apply
retroactively,
do
you
prefer
to
concede
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
not
sure
that
the
question
is
understood
on
both
sides
but
that's
how
i
understood
you.
