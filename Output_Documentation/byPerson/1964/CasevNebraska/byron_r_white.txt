if
you
may,
would
you
take
the
same
–
have
the
same
position
if
the
statute
said
“shall”
instead
of
“may”?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
(inaudible)
--
before
it
adopted
the
point
of
saying
it
had
no
remedy
available?
isn't
it
–
did
it
almost
acknowledge
or
did
it
come
close
to
acknowledging
that
this
might
not
be
a
real
waiver
of
his
right
to
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that
they
left
to
debate
about
it
if
we
are
to
agree
it
reached
a
constitutional
question
here
or
rather
than
just
remand
and
enlighten
the
results?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
it's
most
difficult
or
not,
you'd
be
reaching
a
constitutional
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
counsel,
i
would
think
that
this
is
--
this
remind
well
of
a
file
that
something
that
they
have
to
--
the
statute
was
signed
by
the
governor
and
that
he
might
have
had
his
hearing
already.
but
he's
taken
away.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
just
answering
you,
you
said
plead
at
sometime
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
object,
you're
at
this
level,
put
to
a
remand
on
this
case,
the
vacating
of
the
judgment
in
the
remand
for
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
to
be
considered
the
case
in
the
light
of
the
new
statute?
do
you
object
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
the
only
reason
that
you
might
give
this
remedy
or
do
a
remand
would
be
at
some
court
decided
--
that
the
court
decided
that
he
has
to
file
a
new
petition.
let's
assume
he
filed
a
new
petition
in
the
lower
court,
let's
assume
he
had
last
week
filed
a
new
petition
to
the
lower
court,
do
you
think
this
new
remedy
is
meant
for
this
kind
of
a
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
you
could
get
a
hearing
on
the
allegations
you
made?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
even
got
counsel.
