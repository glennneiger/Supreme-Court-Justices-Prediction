on
the

--
that

everything
when

would
have
vacated
this

remand

the
nebraska
supreme
court
for
further
proceedings
in
light
of

j.
brennan,

well,
if

gideon?
justice
william

well
can
the
attorney
general
make
the
representation
that
no
opposition
on
that
score
would
be
interposed
with
the
petitioner
under
the
new
statute
by
this
person?
justice
william
j.

you
cannot
make
it.
