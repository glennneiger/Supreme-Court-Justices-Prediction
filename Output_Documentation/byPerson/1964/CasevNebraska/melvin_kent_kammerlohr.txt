mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
i
can
be
quite
brief
here.
i
would
like
to
point
out
mr.
meador,
counsel
for
petitioner,
is
really
saying
here,
and
it's
in
his
brief.
he
wants
a
sanction
on
this
remand
even
before
the
new
statute
was
passed,
that
if
nebraska
did
not
provide
a
remedy
on
remand
that
the
petitioner
be
brought
back
up
here
and
discharge
without
any
evidentiary
hearing.
now,
that's
the
thing
that
i
would
primarily
like
to
make
an
objection
to
that
that
doesn't
get
to
the
meat
of
the
case,
to
that
question
involve
of
whether
these
allegations
are
true
or
not.
that's
just
simply
no
way
to
solve
the
question,
to
bring
it
back
up
here
supposing
nebraska
did
not
have
a
remedy.
now,
the
question
that
mr.
justice
stewart
asked,
i
do
believe
that
--
we
believe
that
this
does
not
provide
a
remedy
for
petitioner,
this
new
statute.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
we
do
believe
that
this
does
provide
a
remedy.
this
new
statute
does
provide
a
remedy
for
the
petitioner
but
like
mr.
meador
said,
we
can't
guarantee
that
some
court
might
or
some
county
attorney
who
handles
the
case
might
object
to
retroactivity
or
something
of
that
nature
and
some
court
say
that
the
statute
isn't
retroactive.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
no,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
because
this
will
be
handled
back
in
the
lower
court
--
trial
court
by
the
county
attorney
who
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
no,
your
honor.
the
--
this
court,
in
jennings
versus
illinois,
in
this
very
similar
situation
where
they
had
passed
a
new
post-conviction
remedy,
remanded
to
determine
if
the
case
came
within
the
new
post-conviction
remedy
and
if
not,
you
could
proceed
to
federal
court.
in
a
recent
case
passed
a
few
months
ago
of
henry
versus
mississippi
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
i
do.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
the
only
objection
i
have
is
attaching
any
statement
on
this
remand
that
for
future,
if
we
want
to
talk
about
the
future,
for
any
kind
of
authority
to
say
that
we're
going
to
bring
a
man
back
up
here
and
discharge
him
without
any
evidentiary
hearing
at
all
if
the
state
fail
because
you're
not,
it's
not
the
state
court
that's
then
being
punished,
it's
the
public
that's
being
punished
because
we
have
to
assume
that
there's
an
interest
in
law
enforcement
and
bringing
these
people
to
justice,
as
well
as
protecting
their
rights.
and
if
we're
going
to
discharge
them
merely
on
their
allegations
without
an
evidentiary
hearing,
i
don't
think
we're
solving
any
problem.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
no,
mr.
justice
goldberg
i
did
not.
i
would
only
like
to
foresee
--
i
see
no
reason
to
not
proceed
along
the
lines
of
jennings
versus
illinois
and
henry
versus
mississippi
where
this
court
said,
if
the
court
could
not
do
it
or
found
it
without
proper
subject
that
the
man
could
then
go
to
federal
district
court
and
get
his
hearing
and
i
don't
see
why
he
should
be
discharged
without
a
hearing
that's
all.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
to
eliminate
his
â€“-
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes,
we
have
no
objection
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
one
of
the
--
mr.
meador's
--
one
his
main
contention
in
his
brief
has
been
because
of
the
congestion
in
the
federal
district
courts
that
we
shouldn't
continue
saying
well,
if
he's
exhausted
the
state
remedy,
he
can
go
to
the
federal
district
court.
but
i
say
that
the
congress
rightly
established
this
right
in
federal
district
court,
and
if
there
is
congestion
there
are
undoubtedly
many
things
that
congress
can
do
to
help
this
congestion
problem.
and
that
is
really
the
question,
and
it's
more
important
that
the
man
get
an
evidentiary
hearing
rather
than
just
discharge
him
on
these
allegations.
that's
really
what
i
want
to
argue,
so
i
wouldn't
like
to
see
any
kind
of
a
sanction
that
he
would
be
discharged
in
--
if
something
should
happen
and
he
didn't
get
a
hearing,
i
think
you
should
go
in
federal
district
court.
thank
you.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
i
would
be
able
to
do
that
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
didn't
quite
understand
it
and
i'd
like
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
that
he
would
then
have
adjusted
his
state
remedies,
i
don't
think
this
would
ever
happen
but
if
that
should
happen,
then
he
then
has
exhausted
his
state
remedies
and
may
file
petition
on
federal
district
court,
and
the
same
as
has
this
court
had
just
done
in
henry
versus
mississippi
a
few
months
ago.
thank
you.
