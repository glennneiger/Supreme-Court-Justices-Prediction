mr.
daniel
j.
meador
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
state
post-conviction
proceeding
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska.
the
state
court
has
refused
to
hear
the
petitioner's
claim
that
he
is
incarcerated
in
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights
to
counsel.
the
merits
of
the
right
to
counsel
claim
were
not
before
the
court
in
this
case.
the
question
which
is
presented,
however,
is
one
of
pressing
current
importance
in
the
administration
of
state
criminal
justice.
and
that
question
is
whether
this
court
should
require
a
state
to
comply
with
its
constitutional
duty
so-called
a
hearing
to
the
petitioner.
the
facts
are
quite
brief.
the
petitioner
was
arrested
one
night
in
april
of
1963
while
he
was
walking
along
the
streets
in
lincoln,
nebraska.
he
was
taken
to
the
jail
and
as
he
puts
it
he
was
booked
on
an
open
charge.
he
was
hailed
incommunicado
for
four
days
the
a
jail,
and
incidentally,
i
might
say,
all
the
facts
here
come
from
the
petition
of
habeas
corpus
filed
in
this
state
trial
court,
the
allegations
of
which
are
uncontradicted
at
this
point.
he
had
said
he
was
held
incommunicado
for
four
days,
on
the
fourth
day
in
information
was
filed
against
him
in
the
trial
court
charging
him
with
burglary,
which
is
a
felony
on
nebraska
law
carrying
a
sentence
of
10
years
in
the
penitentiary.
on
the
same
day
the
information
was
filed,
the
petitioner
was
taken
before
the
prosecuting
attorney
where
he
was
threatened
with
prosecution
under
the
habitual
criminal
law
unless
he
would
agree
to
waive
a
preliminary
hearing,
agree
to
waive
his
right
to
counsel,
and
agree
to
plead
guilty.
the
nebraska
habitual
criminal
law
carries
a
penalty
from
10
to
20
years
in
the
penitentiary
for
two
prior
convictions,
a
penalty
in
addition
to
the
sentences
that
would
be
imposed
for
the
principal
offense.
as
a
result
of
this
prosecutorial
coercion,
the
petitioner
did
waive
a
preliminary
hearing.
he
was
taken
before
the
court
the
same
day,
four
days
after
he
had
been
arrested,
at
which
time
still
as
a
result
of
the
coercion,
he
did
waive
counsel
and
plead
guilty.
the
trial
judge
found
him
guilty
of
burglary
and
thereafter
sentenced
him
to
five
years
in
the
penitentiary.
at
no
time
from
arrest
through
the
sentencing
did
the
petitioner
have
the
assistance
of
counsel.
apparently,
no
appeal
was
taken,
and
a
few
months
later
in
september
1963,
the
present
proceeding
was
initiated
in
the
same
court
which
had
convicted
and
sentenced
the
petitioner.
the
trial
court
dismissed
the
petition,
the
petition
is
now
before
the
court
here
in
this
case,
the
petition
alleging
the
facts
which
i
have
summarized,
dismissed
this
petition
without
any
response
from
the
state
and
without
holding
any
hearing.
the
petitioner
thereupon
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska,
and
that
court
in
its
opinion
in
effect
acknowledged
that
the
petitioner's
allegations
showed
the
violation
of
the
constitution
which
required
an
evidentiary
hearing.
and
yet
the
court
affirmed
the
dismissal
on
the
ground
that
this
was
a
habeas
corpus
petition
and
that
under
nebraska
law,
habeas
corpus
will
reach
only
jurisdictional
defects
in
the
conviction
and
that
this
claim
of
denial
of
counsel
is
not
of
that
sort.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
no
sir,
the
opinion
is
completely
silent
about
any
other
possible
remedy
at
all.
it
addresses
itself
solely
to
habeas
corpus.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
no
sir,
we
need
not
to
consider
it
now
because
the
new
statute
which
has
just
been
enacted
in
nebraska,
which
does
appear
to
provide
a
post-conviction
procedure
which
i
would
like
to
discuss
in
just
a
moment
in
somewhat
greater
length.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
no
sir,
the
law
--
and
it's
perfectly
clear
and
in
fact
the
state
conceded
in
its
response
filed
through
the
certiorari
petition
in
this
court,
that
there
was
no
other
remedy
under
nebraska
law,
and
certainly
the
nebraska
law
will
quite
clearly
reveal
that.
the
time
the
judgment
was
entered
by
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
there
was
no
remedy
at
all
it
explained.
certiorari
was
then
sought
here
and
as
i
said,
the
state
responded
with
this
concession
of
no
remedy.
certiorari
was
then
granted.
some
two
weeks
ago,
after
the
grant
of
certiorari
here,
and
after
of
briefs
both
sides
have
been
filed,
the
nebraska
legislature
enacted
the
new
statute
i
just
mentioned.
my
understanding,
the
copies
of
this
had
been
supplied
to
the
members
of
the
court
by
the
attorney
general's
office.
that's
precisely
the
point
i
proposed
to
discuss
at
the
moment
and
my
proposition
is
that
the
effect
of
that
statute
on
this
case
is
to
strengthen
the
petitioner's
case.
it
shows
now
that
there
is
a
way,
a
possible
way
in
which
the
state
can
carry
out
its
constitutional
duty
of
according
the
hearing.
and
by
doing
that,
it
touched
the
ground
from
under,
one
of
the
major
arguments
made
in
the
brief
of
the
state.
as
i
read
the
brief
state
of
the
state's
brief,
one
of
the
reason
it
gives
for
this
court
not
entering
the
kind
of
mandate
the
petitioner
seeks
is
that
there
is
no
way
under
nebraska
law
that
a
hearing
can
be
given
the
petition.
the
argument
seems
to
be
that
simply
there
is
no
state
machinery
available,
whereby
the
state
can
meet
its
constitutional
obligation.
that
argument
is
gone,
the
statute
wipes
it
out.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
no
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
no
sir,
that's
where
i
would
disagree
strongly.
nebraska
has
not
yet
accorded
this
petition
of
the
hearing
that
he's
entitled
to.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
no
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
i
would
hold
to
the
same
mandate
precisely.
the
statute
has
not
changed
the
mandate
i
would
seek
and
the
mandate
that
i
think
is
appropriate
here.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes,
the
mandate
i
seek
is
a
remand
of
the
case
with
direction
to
the
petition
of
the
accord
of
the
hearing.
that's
the
mandate
i
would
still
seek
because
while
there
is
a
statute
sitting
on
the
books
of
nebraska,
that
statute
does
not
guarantee
the
hearing
petition
is
entitled
to.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
well,
this
would
be
one
of
the
questions.
the
nebraska
court
might
take
up
and
might
resolve
against
the
petitioner.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
an
application
by
this
petition
for
hearing
under
the
statute?
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
well,
in
the
first
place
i
would
say
there
is
no
difficult
constitutional
question
presented
here
by
this
case.
it
seems
to
be
quite
clear
for
30
more
years
that
the
court
has
said
again
and
again,
the
state
has
an
obligation
to
find
corrective
process.
it
hasn't
done
so.
the
question
that
is
before
the
court,
is
whether
the
court
is
going
to
continue
to
follow
what
might
be
called,
with
all
deference,
a
policy
of
non-enforcement
of
a
state
prisoner
his
right
to
hearing
in
state
courts.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
that
is
the
disposition
i
want
with
one
additional
item.
and
that
is
a
direction
that
the
hearing
be
given
by
some
procedure.
it's
no
concern
of
this
court,
whether
it's
given
under
the
new
act
or
by
enlargement
of
the
existing
habeas
corpus
or
whatever.
the
court
is
though,
to
cut
this
petitioner
lose
with
simply
that
mandate,
guarantees
him
nothing.
it
sends
him
back.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir
he
could
and
that's
what
the
state
prison
is
–-
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes,
and
that's
what
the
state
prisoners
have
been
doing
year
after
year
coming
back
again
and
again
through
the
state
courts
here
to
the
federal
district
court,
and
what
justice
rutlegde
referred
to
as
the
merry-go-round.
and
that's
--
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir,
i
think
i
would
because
the
statute
leaves
plenty
of
room
for
varying
instructions
and
this
is
not
simply
a
matter
of
imagination
or
surmise.
we
have
solid
experience.
it
can
be
drawn
on
the
show
what
can
happen.
you
look
for
example
to
illinois
and
maryland,
two
states
which
did
adopt
some
years
ago,
a
post-conviction
act
of
this
sort,
quite
similar
to
this
and
yet
the
state
courts
when
it
took
the
statute
and
construed
it,
construed
it
in
such
a
manner
as
to
frustrate
litigation
of
many
federal
claims.
on
the
2255
in
federal
courts,
this
court
with
no
doubt
really
knows
there
have
been
many,
many
disagreements
among
the
district
judges
and
the
courts
of
appeals,
as
to
what
kinds
of
claims
can
be
asserted
on
the
2255
--
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes,
it's
very
similar,
it's
not
identical
but
it's
quite
similar
to
2255.
there
is
plenty
of
room
for
example,
if
i
might
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
statute,
it
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
state's
brief,
the
respondent's
brief
at
page
17,
that's
a
print
of
the
bill,
but
the
enacted
statute
is
identical.
in
section,
1
paragraph
1,
the
provision
is
“the
prisoner
in
custody
claiming
the
right
to
be
released
where
there
was
such
a
denial
or
infringement
of
the
rights
of
the
prisoner
to
render
the
judgment
void
or
voidable
under
the
constitution.”
well
right
there
is
the
question,
what
kind
of
denial,
what
is
such
a
denial
as
will
render
the
judgment
void
or
voidable?
there
is
abundant
leeway
for
differing
views
about
that.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir
there
could
be.
i
could
envision
with
no
great
difficulty.
as
state
court
is
saying
this
is
not
such
a
denial
as
it
renders
judgment.
void
here
under
our
view
of
voidance,
the
court
has
already
said
that
it
doesn't
affect
the
jurisdiction
for
example
of
the
convicting
court
despite
johnson
against
zerbst
and
gideon
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
this
court
might
reverse
on
the
merits
and
so
on,
but
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
in
the
first
instance,
i
can
imagine
this.
the
second
paragraph,
for
example
under
section
1,
provides
that
if
the
files
and
records
in
motion
show
that
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
no
relief,
he'll
get
no
hearing.
2255
shows
for
example
the
disagreements
you
can
get
about
where
the
files
and
record
show
he's
entitle
to
no
relief.
my
point
is
that
in
this
state
of
affairs,
all
we
have
here
is
a
statute
on
the
books
that
does
provide
a
way,
it
clears
the
path
for
nebraska
to
go
ahead
and
carry
out
the
constitutional
mandate,
but
it
doesn't
guarantee
that
it
will.
when
the
petitioner
goes
back
unless
he
has
a
mandate
from
this
court
and
the
state
court
is
practically
free,
if
it
goes
on
the
assumption
that
it
has
no
enforceable
obligation
to
hear
the
constitutional
claim,
it's
perfectly
free
to
deny
a
hearing,
force
another
appeal
in
the
state
supreme
court,
back
up
here
or
either
into
the
federal
district
court,
and
we're
perpetuating
the
same
kind
of
labyrinthine
groping
that
the
hawk
went
through
16
to
17
years,
except
this
petitioner
doesn't
have
16
years,
he
has
a
five-year
sentence
as
he
asserts,
it's
unconstitutional,
he
should
be
given
an
effective
hearing.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
it
seems
to
me
that
that
opinion
is
not
as
clear
as
it
could
be.
but
it
seems
to
me
they
and
in
fact
say,
his
allegations
of
coercion
here
are
such
that
call
for
an
evidentiary
hearing.
but
there
again,
that
is
a
fairly
debatable
question.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
it
might
be
difficult
doing
that
so.
yes,
i'm
a
little
puzzled
over
what
the
really
difficult
constitutional
question
is
that
the
court
has
to
reach
to
enter
the
mandate
--
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
constitutional
question
here
has
long
been
settled,
and
that
is
that
the
state
has
an
obligation
to
afford
a
hearing
to
a
claim
of
unconstitutional
imprisonment.
there's
a
long
series
of
cases
in
which
this
has
been
explicitly
said,
i
acknowledge
that
there
is
debate
as
to
whether
this
has
been
squarely
held.
what
has
not
been
held,
i
would
freely
acknowledge
is,
that
it's
never
been
held
that
this
court
will
direct
the
state
to
carry
out
that
obligation.
i
think
it's
debatable
that
in
some
of
the
cases
that
are
in
petitioner's
brief,
the
court
may
have
held
debatably
that
there
is
an
obligation
on
the
state
to
accord
the
hearing,
but
it
stopped
short
of
directing
that
the
obligation
be
carried
out.
but
certainly
by
explicit
dicta,
time
and
again
for
30
or
more
years
the
court
has
said,
the
obligation
is
there.
the
court
has
followed
what,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
you
might
call
a
policy
of
non-enforcement.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
no
question.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question,
there
is,
the
problem
is
essentially
a
problem
of
adjusting
the
administration
of
state
criminal
justice
in
the
context
of
the
federal
system,
are
you
going
to
require
the
states
to
furnish
the
remedy,
which
the
court
has
said
they
have
an
obligation
to
do?
or
are
we
going
to
relegate
the
prisoner
to
a
remedy
over
in
the
federal
system
in
federal
district
courts.
that's
the
question.
however,
if
the
characterized
--
the
state
--
the
state's
position,
as
i
read
it,
is
this
court
should
continue
to
follow
this
policy
of
non-enforcement,
in
effect
continue
to
allow
the
state
with
impunity
to
deny
hearing.
what
the
state
is
doing,
it
moves
to
imprison
the
man
and
at
the
same
time
shut
this
door
on
his
face,
when
he
claims
that
he
is
unconstitutionally
imprisoned.
and
all
that
he's
been
is
that
the
prisoner
to
go
to
the
federal
district
court.
but
further,
--
this
is
further
reason
why
i
would
argue
that
the
mandate
is
still
appropriate
in
this
case
despite
the
new
statute.
the
first
reason
of
course
is
to
protect
this
petition,
to
ensure
that
he
within
some
reasonable
expedition
gets
the
hearing
he's
entitled
to.
but
a
second
reason
is
this
petition
or
situation
is
not
unique.
as
this
court
knows
all
too
well
there
are
prisoners
all
over
the
country
seeking
remedies,
frustrations
here
and
there
through
the
state
courts
up
here,
and
into
the
federal
district
courts,
finally
this
kind
of
merry-go-round
in
their
brief.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
problem
has
reached
such
proportion,
it's
appropriate.
now,
if
the
case
is
here,
the
issue
is
here
too.
but
this
court
simply
could
cut
through
this
kind
of
gordion
knot
and
straighten
the
matter
out,
make
it
plain
that
the
courts
which
condemn
the
man
are
the
courts
which
was
to
hear
his
claim
that
he's
being
unconstitutionally
condemned.
and
in
light
of
that,
the
statute
really
doesn't
affect
the
basic
posture
of
the
case.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
i
suppose
that
he
could
have
done
that
but
--
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
my
point,
i
suppose
is
that
even
if
he
files
a
petition
today
and
tomorrow
or
any
time,
he
has
no
guarantee
of
getting
a
hearing.
now,
if
he
had
no
other
case
going,
that
would
be
just
a
fact
of
life
we
have
to
live
with.
but
now
that
he
brought
his
case
for
some
two
years
already,
out
of
the
five
of
his
sentence,
now
up
to
this
level,
the
question
is
here,
it
seems
to
me
the
petitioner
is
entitled
have
the
state
rectify
its
constitutional
violation.
judgment
before
the
court
here
isn't
an
unconstitutional
judgment
that
denies
all
right
to
hearing,
and
therefore
it
cannot
stand.
the
only
question,
it
seems
to
me
before
the
court
is
a
kind
of
mandate
the
case
goes
back
on,
whether
it's
a
mandate
hearing
be
given,
or
simply
a
mandate
that
for
the
state
court
to
take
another
look
at
it
and
possibly
deny
him
hearing.
one
further
--
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
first,
i
would
say
that
with
all
due
respect
to
the
attorney
general
of
nebraska,
i
don't
believe
he
can
control
the
courts
of
nebraska
in
how
they
handle
the
statute,
what
they
do
with
it.
there's
enough
experience
to
see
that
the
court
can
go
many
different
ways
with
the
statute
of
this
kind.
so
i
would
say
that
kind
of
oral
representation
here
is
really
beside
the
point
as
far
as
guaranteeing
the
hearing.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir.
well,
that
would
be
alright
with
me
so
long
as
the
mandate
says
a
hearing
is
required
by
the
state.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
no
sir.
i
would
not
contend
that
that
if
upon
the
remand
of
the
case
when
the
state
does
come
in
and
file
its
answer,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
that
will
reveal,
it's
possible.
it's
highly
possible
just
as
the
federal
district
court
on
habeas
corpus
might
resolve
and
dismiss
it
without
an
evidential
hearing.
that
would
certainly
be
open
to
the
state.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir,
not
to
give
a
hearing.
but
my
point
is
the
state
has
made
so
far,
no
inquiry
at
all
into
the
truth
of
the
allegation.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
or
even
into
whether
there's
been
a
waiver
of
the
claim
now
i'll
say.
there's
simply
been
no
inquiry,
and
that's
what
the
constitution
prohibits.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
no
sir.
a
better
way
to
put
it
maybe
there
must
be
an
inquiry.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
of
some
kind.
jennings
against
illinois
for
example,
in
speaking
of
a
state
hearing,
mentions
an
inquiry
into
the
verity
of
the
allegations
or
a
finding
that
the
claim
has
been
waived
in
some
fashion
previously.
some
such
inquiry
has
to
be
made,
and
this
is
--
what
we
have
here
is
a
total
refusal
to
make
any
inquiry
at
all.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
it
might
very
well,
yes
sir.
assuming
there
had
been
somewhere
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
constitutional
claims.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
that
would
satisfy
the
constitution,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
correct.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
i
doubt
that
it
could
be.
and
if
it
hasn't
been
the
constitution
requires
that
there'd
be
some
opportunity
somewhere
somehow
for
it
to
be
litigated.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
right.
in
the
state
courts,
i
certainly
add
that.
i
might
add
one
further
observation
about
why
it
is
very
important,
desirable
at
this
time
to
go
up
into
this,
the
kind
of
mandate
here
and
that
is
that
it
seems
to
me,
we
have
here
a
circumstance,
somewhat
analogous
it
seems
to
me,
what
court
faced
in
mapp
against
ohio
when
it
looked
at
the
exclusionary
rule
of
the
illegal
evidence.
we
found
that
since
wolf
against
colorado,
the
refusal
of
the
court
here
or
the
failure
of
the
court
to
make
that
rule
applicable
in
the
state
courts
had
really
not
worked
well
and
that
experience
had
exposed
that
it
was
necessary
then
in
mapp
to
bring
the
rule
up
in
the
state
courts.
we
have
a
similar
circumstance
here,
experience
had
shown,
it
seems
to
me,
and
time
has
shown
that
the
non-enforcement
so
to
speak
or
the
failure
of
the
court
to
require
the
state
affirmatively
to
meet
the
obligation
to
hold
a
hearing
is
causing
undesirable
consequences
tending
to
distort
the
federal
system,
feeding
more
and
more
cases
over
into
the
federal
district
court
and
drawing
those
courts
into
local
criminal
administration.
to
make
the
state
itself
correct
its
own
constitutional
violations
would
seem
to
me
to
be
a
healthy
thing
because
it
might
--
a
state
court
would
be
a
little
more
attentive
to
whether
those
violations
occurred
in
the
first
place.
not
only
that
it's
in
the
state's
own
interest
that
an
effective
and
early
hearing
be
held
that
prisoners
not
have
to
wander
it
through
this
labyrinth
as
they
do
now
because
if
the
conviction
is
invalid,
the
evidence
is
still
around,
and
the
state
can
retry.
so
it's
an
interest,
it
seems
to
me,
every
consideration
points
toward
this,
the
interest
in
expeditious
effective
criminal
administration,
the
state
federal
relationship
in
this
field,
as
well
as
in
this
particularly
the
case
guaranteeing
the
petitioner,
some
time
within
the
span
of
this
five-year
sentence
that
he
gets
the
hearing
that
he
is
constitutionally
entitled
to.
so
the
new
statute
and
all
that
is
still
the
mandate
petitioner
asked
for.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
that
sounds
to
me
to
be
the
mandate
for
that
one.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
clarify,
i
don't
want
to
be
in
the
position
of
conceding
something
i
didn't
concede.
the
mandate
i
would
agree
with
is
the
one
i
understood
to
be
proposed
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
and
that
is
the
case
be
remanded
with
directions
that
a
hearing
to
be
held.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
be
altogether
appropriate
for
this
court
to
say
that
the
hearing
has
to
be
held
under
this
act
although
i
would
have
no
objections
to
that.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes,
you
certainly
would
not
do
it
if
you
disagree
with
me.
one
final
point,
i
might
clarify,
the
state's
objection
to
the
discharge
without
an
evidentiary
hearing
i
think
is
misleading.
it
confuses
the
constitutional
violation
that's
before
the
court.
the
question
of
right
to
counsel
is
not
before
the
court
here,
that's
not
the
constitutional
violation
that
he
will
be
discharged
for.
the
constitutional
violation
that
he
will
be
discharged
for
is
the
violation
of
his
right
to
a
hearing.
no
evidentiary
hearing
is
required
to
establish
that.that's
clear
on
the
record,
it's
conceded
by
the
state
if
he
hasn't
had.
that's
what
he
would
be
discharged
for,
if
the
state
continued
to
violate
that
constitutional
right.
i
don't
know
if
the
court
has
to
abide.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes
sir.
perhaps
the
inquiry
is
the
better
word,
some
kind.
some
kind
of
inquiry
--
adequate
play
of
inquiry
into
the
constitutional
claim.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
thank
you
your
honor.
