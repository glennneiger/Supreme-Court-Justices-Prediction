justice
potter
stewart
your
whole
case
is
that
the
state
is
required
to
give
post-conviction
remedy.
justice
potter
stewart
and
nebraska
has
now
done
so.
justice
potter
stewart
so
is
that
the
end
of
your
case?
justice
potter
stewart
or
is
it
your
claim
that
you
emphasize
this
hearing
business
--
is
it
your
claim
that
if
the
files
in
the
records
conclusively
show
that
everything
this
--
or
every
allegation
in
this
petition
for
habeas
corpus
is
false
and
that
this
man
was
deprived
of
a
lawyer
from
first
to
last,
that
a
hearing
is
still
required?
that
goes
way
beyond
section
2255
of
the
federal
system.
justice
potter
stewart
not
to
give
a
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that
but
you're
--
and
i
now
understand,
i
think,
that
you're
not
just
saying
this
is
a
blanket
rule
and
there
has
to
be
a
full
evidentiary
hearing
in
every
case
regardless
of
what
the
client's
records
may
show.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
let's
take
the
case
of
a
coerced
plea
of
guilty.
how
could
that
possibly
be
ventilated
at
the
crime?
justice
potter
stewart
why
do
you
say
more
on
that?
the
constitution
requires
that
a
state
provide
that.
justice
potter
stewart
by
hearing
you
do
mean
an
inquiry?
i
mean
--
