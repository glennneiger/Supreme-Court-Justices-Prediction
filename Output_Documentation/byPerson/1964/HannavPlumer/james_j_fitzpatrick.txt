mr.
james
j.
fitzpatrick
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
present
attorney
albert
p.
zabin
of
the
boston,
massachusetts
bar
who
is
--
who
did
not
have
all
of
the
qualifications
from
membership
to
this
bar.
i
move
that
he
be
admitted
to
argue
for
the
purposes
pro
hoc
vice
this
case
in
behalf
of
petitioner.
mr.
james
j.
fitzpatrick
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
james
j.
fitzpatrick
mr.
fitzpatrick.
mr.
james
j.
fitzpatrick
thank
you,
your
honor.
relative
to
the
facts
in
this
case,
as
my
brother
has
portrayed
them,
essentially,
there
is
no
conflict
and
the
facts
are
very
simple.
i
think,
however,
there
are
one
or
two
items
that
perhaps
we
could
clarify
in
which
in
--
later
in
my
argument,
will
have
a
bearing.
one,
there
never
was
any
in
hand
service
and
relative
to
the
return
of
service,
page
2
of
the
transcript
of
records,
the
return
of
service
is
indicated.
the
service
was
by
last
and
usual
service,
leaving
it
with
the
wife,
and
namely
mrs.
edward
m.
plumer.
on
page
17
of
that
same
transcript
is
the
affidavit
of
mr.
edward
m.
plumer,
jr.
that
he
did
not
receive
the
service
as
far
as
this
particular
action
or
anything
relating
to
this
action
is
concerned.
particularly,
the
issue
as
my
brother
portrays
it,
is
correct.
the
statute
is
clearly
set
forth
in
the
words
that
i
am
concerned
with,
in
which
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
concerned
with,
are
the
words
that
the
executor
or
admini
--
or
the
administrator
shall
not
be
forced
to
answer.
now,
this
mandatory
language
which
sets
forth
a
definite
and
definitive
time
in
which
to
act
and
to
follow
certain
alternatives
was
never
complied
with
at
any
time,
and
this
is
admitted
by
the
petitioner
in
his
argument
--
in
his
brief.
the
statute
particularly
does
more
than
merely
provide
for
notice.
it
creates
a
defense,
and
i
think
that
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
indicates
the
legislative
intent
or
concern
with
the
massachusetts
statute.
i
think
it
can
be
said
that
the
massachusetts
court
in
part,
particularly
the
case
of
parker
versus
rich,
indicates
that
an
end
to
litigation
be
had.
it
indicates
a
definite
in
--
a
definite
interest
that
actual
notice
without
question
be
had.
i
will
shortly
cover
the
effects
that
this
decision
would
have
should
this
court
reverse
the
circuit
court
of
appeals'
decision.
but
the
statute
does
give
more
than
notice.
it
creates
a
right.
it
creates
a
duty.
and
the
massachusetts
cases
have
been
clear,
i
think,
to
indicate
a
strengthening
of
this
policy
rather
than
a
weakening
of
it.
now,
the
guaranty
trust
case
indicates
to
us
the
essential
test
of
whether
the
outcome
will
be
substantially
the
same
in
both
the
federal
and
state
courts
sitting
in
the
same
state.
my
brother
has
cited
the
sibbach
versus
wilson
case.
now,
this
case,
sibbach
versus
wilson,
also
gives
us
the
definition
of
procedure
or
at
least
what
that
court
at
that
time
felt
was
a
definition
for
procedure.
and
particularly,
it
indicated
that
it
was
the
enforcement
of
rights
rather
than
any
words
which
would
indicate
a
creation
of
rights
which
general
laws
chapter
197,
section
9,
we
submit,
does
do
that
it
does
create
rights.
mr.
james
j.
fitzpatrick
the
right
to
have
a
defense
and
to
close
an
estate
up,
to
settle
the
estate.
and
the
policy
of
a
legislature
is
to
speed
up
the
administration
of
estates.
there
are
property
rights
involved.
mr.
james
j.
fitzpatrick
well,
the
statute
--
actually,
in
terms
of
construction,
i
believe,
makes
a
condition
precedent
certain
actions
which
can
be
followed
in
any
one
of
three
situations.
and
unless
you
concede
this,
the
right
does
not
exist,
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
fitzpatrick
in
this
case,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
j.
fitzpatrick
apparent
--
that's
--
mr.
james
j.
fitzpatrick
that's
correct.
mr.
james
j.
fitzpatrick
well,
the
--
not
only
the
right
to
be
handed
the
summons,
but
the
right
also
that
the
executor
may
have
a
protection
both
from
term
creditors
and
also
from
a
--
any
actions
by
heirs
as
against
him,
it
protects
him
under
the
massachusetts
general
laws.
at
the
end
of
the
year,
this
legis
--
this
executor
or
administrator
is
under
an
obligation
to
make
a
distribution.
he,
at
that
time,
as
a
matter
of
law
becomes
obligated
to
pay
interest
upon
any
and
all
sums
that
he
would
be
paid.
also,
it
would
affect
the
share
that
these
people
would
get
in
the
expenses
of
maintaining
properties.
mr.
james
j.
fitzpatrick
there
was
a
question
your
honor
in
this
case.
there
was
never
--
the
initial
complaint,
as
indicated
in
the
transcript,
indicates
that
the
petitioner
had
fully
complied
with
the
massachusetts
general
laws
relating
to
a
commencement
of
actions
under
general
law,
chapter
197.
that's
the
statute
we're
concerned
with.
the
--
they
later
in
their
brief
and
as
well
the
decision
of
judge
bailey,
the
honorable
bailey
aldrich,
indicate
the
fact
that
they
have
never
complied
with
the
massachusetts
general
laws
either
as
to
service,
actual
service,
that
service
was
ever
accepted
or
that
a
notice
was
properly
filed
in
the
registry
of
probate
so
that
this
aspect
of
the
statute
would
be
complied
with.
none
of
those
three
alternatives
were
ever
complied
with.
mr.
james
j.
fitzpatrick
i
think
that
the
policy
of
the
state
--
of
the
statute
was
not
complied
with
to
this
extent
that
in
1954,
the
addition
to
the
statute
was
related
to
the
service
or
the
(inaudible)
--
strike
that
--
the
filing
of
notice
for
the
registry
of
probate.
they
were
concerned
that
this
would
be
how
it
would
be
done.
if
you
wanted
to
commence
suit
on
or
after
the
period
involved.
now,
the
facts
of
this
case
were
that
the
suit
was
commenced
well
before,
but
never
any
notice
was
ever
filed
as
a
result
of
that,
for
that
action.
thus,
there
was
never
a
compliance
as
a
proper
matter
of
this
--
with
the
statute
at
all,
your
honor.
the
sibbach
case,
once
again,
does
give
us
an
indication
of
what
the
court
considers
to
be
procedural.
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioners,
the
case
of
iovino
and
waterson
wherein
there
is
an
attempt
to
indicate
that
this
case
is
the
foundation
upon
which
this
court
could
reverse
a
decision
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
i
submit
this
case
does
not
apply.
it
has
no
bearing
in
this
case
for
one
reason,
as
far
as
the
facts.
in
the
iovino
versus
waterson
case,
we
had
a
motor
vehicle
accident
in
new
york.
and
as
a
result
of
this,
an
action
was
commenced
with
service
in
hand
upon
a
new
jersey
resident
in
new
york.
actual
service
was
had.
the
court
in
that
case
goes
into
rather
lengthy
discussion
of
the
purpose
of
the
mas
--
of
the
new
york
statute
as
to
the
substitution
of
parties,
but
the
action
had
been
commenced.
the
only
question
as
regarding
the
federal
rules
here
were
the
fact
that
they
weren't
going
to
continue
it,
end
it,
get
rid
of
it.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
our
case
was
never
started
while
the
decedent
was
living
under
any
circumstances.
the
iovino
case
also
specifically
states
and
brings
forth
the
fact
that
the
statute
concerned
was
not
a
mandatory
statute.
it
was
not
an
expressed
mandate
of
the
legislature.
it
expressly
states
in
that
decision
that
they
are
aware
of
this
and
they
give
us
the
basis
for
action.
i
think
that
the
ultimate
effect
of
a
reversal
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
is
that
a
person
from
outside
the
state
of
massachusetts
can
come
in
to
a
federal
court
without
any
compliance
whatsoever
and
secure
rights
that
no
resident
of
that
state
may
have.
now,
i
think
it's
academic
that
the
state
or
the
commonwealth
has
a
right
to
determine
the
method
and
disposition
and
administration
of
the
(inaudible)
of
the
estate.
i
think
that
the
statute,
for
a
good
many
years,
has
been
sustained
in
its
policy.
i
think
that,
with
regard
to
the
question
of
whether
there
was
any
conflict,
that
we
could
look
to
the
case
of
cohen
versus
beneficial
loan
which,
by
inadvertence
was
left
out
of
the
respondent's
brief
which
case
--
where
the
case
where
a
new
jersey
statute
provided
that
in
a
derivative
shareholders'
suit,
that
the
federal
court
ins
--
could
insist
that
a
bond
be
filed
before
any
action
could
be
had.
the
plaintiff
in
that
action
did
not
comply
and
as
a
result
thereof,
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
granted
and
the
matter
then
came
on
for
appellate
action.
the
court
in
the
decision
indicates
this
that
they
looked
to
the
policy
of
the
statute.
i
submit
that
looking
for
the
policy
in
this
statute
will
cause
the
--
and
we
hope
the
court
to
protect
the
rights
of
all
its
citizens
and
the
intention
of
the
legislature.
the
court
also
looked
to
the
fiduciary
relationship
of
a
stockholder
to
his
other
stockholders
into
the
corporation.
i
think
the
court
here
is
also
concerned
with
the
policy
that
wasteless
litigation
or
that
litigation,
if
it
be
had,
must
come
to
an
end
at
some
time.
the
court
in
that
case,
also,
said
that
there
was
no
conflict
between
the
law
of
new
york
and
the
federal
rules.
we
submit
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
conflict
between
the
federal
rules
and
the
law
of
massachusetts.
the
law
of
massachusetts
is
substantive.
it
creates
rights,
duties,
obligations.
it
protects
property.
and
respectfully,
we
ask
that
the
--
that
this
court
sustain
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
its
decision.
thank
you,
your
honor.
