mr.
albert
p.
zabin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
november
5th,
1961,
the
petitioner,
a
citizen
of
ohio,
received
severe
and
crippling
injuries
in
an
automobile
accident
in
south
carolina
because
of
the
alleged
negligence
of
the
respondent's
(inaudible).
she
commenced
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
the
district
of
massachusetts
against
the
respondent,
a
citizen
of
massachusetts,
and
has
been
effectively
barred
from
ever
having
a
hearing
on
the
merits
of
her
claim
because
she
complied
with
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
the
respondent
qualified
as
executor
by
filing
a
performance
bond
in
the
probate
court
are
in
march
1st,
1962.
the
complaint
in
this
action
was
filed
on
february
6th,
1963
and
service
was
made
in
full
compliance
with
rule
4
(d)
(1)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
when
the
united
states
marshall
left
a
copy
of
the
summons
and
the
complaint
at
the
respondent's
dwelling
house
in
the
hands
of
his
wife.
section
9
of
chapter
197
of
the
massachusetts
general
laws
provides
in
substance
that
an
action
against
an
executor
must
first
be
commenced
within
a
year
of
his
giving
bond,
that
it
must
be
served
within
a
year,
and
that
service
must
be
made
personally
upon
the
executor
unless
a
statutory
notice
of
the
suit
has
been
filed
in
the
probate
court
or
unless
the
executor
accepts
service.
the
respondent
filed
his
answer
in
the
united
states
district
court
on
february
26th,
1963,
two
days
prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
time
limited
by
the
massachusetts
statute
here
involved.
on
august
5th,
the
respondent
filed
interrogatories
and
on
august
26th,
he
moved
for
summary
judgment.
the
motion
was
allowed.
the
district
court
holding
that
under
the
doctrine
of
guaranty
trust
versus
york
and
ragan
versus
merchants
transfer
company,
the
motion
would
have
to
be
allowed
because
service
was
made
pursuant
to
the
federal
rules
and
not
under
massachusetts
statute,
section
9,
chapter
197.
timely
appeal
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
which
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
district
court
on
april
29th.
this
court
granted
our
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
on
october
12th,
1964.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
in
a
case
where
federal
jurisdiction
is
based
solely
on
diversity
of
citizenship
between
the
litigants,
service
upon
an
executor
shall
be
made
in
the
mode
and
manner
prescribed
by
state
law
or
in
the
mode
and
manner
prescribed
by
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedures.
now,
the
action
in
this
case
was
commenced
within
the
year
and
service
was
made
within
the
year.
therefore,
timeliness
of
this
action
is
not
an
issue
on
this
appeal,
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
instant
case
is
distinguishable
from
ragan
versus
merchants
transfer
company
and
guaranty
trust
company
versus
york,
relied
on
by
the
courts
below
and
by
the
respondent
here.
unlike
those
cases,
the
application
of
rule
4
(d)
(1)
in
this
case
does
not
link
from
the
time
in
which
mrs.
hannah
had
to
maintain
her
action
by
one
instant,
at
least
in
this
respect,
the
defendant
--
the
respondent
has
not
been
prejudiced
by
the
application
of
the
federal
rules.
though
stated
broadly,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
there
shall
be
one
rule
governing
service
of
process
in
the
united
states
district
courts
whether
there
shall
be
50.
mr.
albert
p.
zabin
the
--
i
was
going
to
come
to
that.
in
the
--
mr.
albert
p.
zabin
but
i
can
deal
with
it
now,
your
honor.
in
the
affidavit,
in
support
of
his
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
respondent
averred
only
that
he
did
not
accept
service.
that's
on
page
17
of
the
record.
he
never
averred
that
he
did
not
have
actual
notice
of
the
pendency
of
the
action
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
answer
was
filed
within
the
year,
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
assume
that
he
did
have
actual
notice
of
the
case.
mr.
albert
p.
zabin
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
it
would
not,
except
in
answer
to
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
this
reasoning
that
the
--
this
is
a
matter
of
substance
because
of
the
legislative
policy
of
massachusetts,
simply
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
fact
in
this
case,
to
whatever
with
--
if
any
weight
at
all
should
be
given
to
the
massachusetts'
policy,
that
policy
has
been
substantially
satisfied.
we
submit
that
the
application
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
in
this
case
was
not
only
permissible
but
was
required.
section
2072
of
title
28,
the
so-called
enabling
act,
empowers
this
court
to
promulgate
rules
of
civil
procedure
with
the
limitations
only
that
these
rules
may
not
abridge,
enlarge,
or
modify
any
substantive
right
and
of
course
may
not
affect
the
right
of
trial
by
jury.
now,
rule
4
(d)
(1)
promulgated
under
that
statute
has
the
force
of
a
congressional
statute
and
we
submit
that
the
court
below
could
have
properly
refused
to
apply
this
rule
only
if
the
application
of
this
rule
transcended
the
rule
making
authority
the
act
confers
on
this
court.
we
think
that
it
clearly
does
not
do
so.
now,
under
the
standard
of
sibbach
versus
wilson,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
application
of
rule
4
(d)
(1)
governs
practice
and
procedure
in
the
federal
courts.
the
contention
however,
the
dispute
in
the
case,
is
whether
it
affects
the
substantive
rights
of
the
parties.
we
suggest
that
service
of
process
is
merely
the
manner
in
which
the
litigant
is
given
noted
--
notice
of
a
suit
pending
against
him
and
the
formal
manner
in
which
a
court
asserts
jurisdiction
over
the
person
who
litigate
--
over
the
person
who's
the
litigant.
we'd
hardly
see
how
the
manner
in
which
a
party
is
notified
in
the
suit
and
the
manner
in
which
the
court
asserts
jurisdiction
over
him
can
ever
remotely
affect
the
outcome
or
the
course
that
the
litigation
takes.
now,
since
this
action
is
timely,
the
only
substantive
rights
involved
in
this
case
are
those
rights
which
are
created
by
the
law
of
south
carolina
where
the
accident
occurred
and
which
would
be
recognized
by
massachusetts
under
the
normal
application
of
its
rules
of
conflicts
of
laws.
no
one,
none
of
the
courts
below
nor
i
gather
the
respondent
argues
that
these
rights
having
all
been
affected
by
the
application
of
rule
4
(d)
(1).
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
reasoned
that
the
legislative
purpose
of
massachusetts
turned
this
application
of
rule
4
(d)
(1)
from
a
matter
of
mere
procedure
to
a
matter
of
substance.
we
suggest
to
this
court
that
this
involves,
first,
a
misinterpretation
of
the
enabling
act.
we
suggest
that
a
state
may
have
policies.
it
may
have
purposes
which,
in
appropriate
cases,
may
be
respected
by
a
federal
court.
but
as
such,
in
private
civil
litigation,
a
state
does
not
have
a
substantive
right.
further,
the
reasoning
of
the
court
below,
it
creates
a
test
which
is
almost
impossible
to
apply
because
if
this
is
not
reversed,
then
whenever
there
is
a
conflict
between
a
federal
rule
and
a
state
statute,
the
district
court
for
each
state
and
for
each
statute
will
have
to
determine
the
strength
of
the
state
policy
and
reliance
on
the
federal
rules
is
likely
to
become
a
trap
for
any
counsel
who
does
not
fully
comply
with
state
rules.
but,
mo
--
mr.
albert
p.
zabin
that's
right,
your
honor
--
mr.
albert
p.
zabin
i
should
say,
your
honor,
that
a
state
may
have
an
interest.
in
this
case,
it's
per
--
we
would
concede
for
--
arguendo
that
massachusetts
does
have
an
interest.
but
we're
dealing
here
with
the
application
of
a
federal
rule
promulgated
under
the
authority
of
a
congressional
statute.
and
in
this
instance,
this
is
an
--
a
case
which
calls
to
the
application,
if
ever
there
was
a
case
of
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution.
mr.
albert
p.
zabin
well,
i
should
say,
your
honor,
that
that
interpretation
would
require
a
reading
of
the
enabling
act,
the
term
"substantive
right"
i
think
in
a
strange
manner,
whereas
i
argue
before
and
i
think
that
as
you,
your
honor
points
out,
a
state
may
have
an
interest
but
it
doesn't
have
a
substantive
right.
and
the
limitation
on
this
court
is
only,
aside
from
the
question
of
jury
trial
is
only
that
it
may
not
abridge,
modify,
or
enlarge
a
substantive
right.
and
i
think
that
limitation
must
be
read
only
as
it
applies
to
the
rights
of
the
litigants.
mr.
albert
p.
zabin
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
most
important
result
of
a
failure
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
the
beginning
of
the
destruction
of
uniformity
of
federal
procedure
because
if
the
massachusetts
legislature
policy
is
to
be
given
controlling
weight
here,
then
the
policy
of
every
state
which
has
a
rule
of
procedure
different
from
the
federal
rules
must
also
be
given
weight.
and
i
think
that
this
would
be
the
beginning
of
the
destruction
of
uniformity
of
federal
procedure
which
is
after
all
a
policy
of
congress.
now,
the
respondent
has
argued
in
his
brief
that
were
this
action
in
a
state
court
on
march
1st,
1963,
the
date
when
the
period
of
limitations
expired,
the
plaintiff
would
have
had
no
enforceable
rights.
and
secondly,
he
argues
that
the
statute
involved
here
deals
with
the
administration
of
estates.
we
suggest
that
his
first
argument
really
begs
the
question.
the
test
so
far,
of
whether
or
not
state
law
rather
than
federal
law
applies
in
a
diversity
case
is
whether
a
litigant
could
predict
before
the
forum
is
selected,
that
an
outcome
in
each
form
will
be
substantially
different
because
of
the
differing
rules
to
be
applied.
now,
what
the
respondent
has
done
is
he
has
looked
at
the
penalty
which
--
within
--
which
in
massachusetts
court
would
impose
for
failure
to
apply
with
its
own
--
comply
with
its
own
statute
without
first
determining
whether
or
not
the
application
of
the
state
statute
is
required
in
the
federal
court.
if
this
is
the
--
going
to
be
the
test,
then
it
means
that
whenever
there
is
a
difference
between
state
statute
and
a
federal
rule
and
the
state
court
would
apply
a
penalty
for
the
failure
to
comply
with
its
statute
then
in
every
case,
the
state
statute
would
have
to
take
precedence
over
the
federal
rule
in
a
federal
court,
viewed
prospectively,
as
we
suggest
this
court
has
done
in
the
past,
the
method
of
service
cannot
affect
the
outcome
of
the
litigation
and
the
method
of
service
is
not
going
to
be
a
factor
in
counsel's
thinking
in
determining
whether
to
bring
an
action
in
the
federal
court
in
--
or
in
the
state
court.
as
to
the
respondent's
second
contention,
we
suggest
that
the
part
of
the
massachusetts
statute
here
involved
does
not
deal
with
the
settlement
of
estates.
it
does
not
even
deal
with
the
method
of
notifying
an
executor
of
a
claim
against
the
estate.
it
deals
only
with
the
method
of
notifying
the
executor
of
the
pendency
of
an
action
in
court
against
him.
the
cases
relied
on
by
the
respondent
are
distinguishable
from
the
case
at
bar.
his
leading
case
seems
to
be
security
trust
company
cited
on
page
7
of
his
brief.
that
case,
like
ragan
and
guaranty
trust,
involved
the
timeliness
of
the
suit.
in
security
trust
company,
the
executor
had
already
been
discharged
and
the
period
limited
by
the
probate
court
had
long
since
expired
prior
to
the
commencement
of
that
action.
and,
in
young,
they
also
cited
on
page
7
of
the
respondent's
brief,
the
court
dealt
with
the
question
of
whether
a
federal
judgment
creditor
of
an
estate
had
a
better
position,
vis-à-vis
the
other
creditors,
than
a
state
judgment
creditor.
now,
in
the
instant
case,
the
application
of
rule
4
(d)
(1)
does
not
give
mrs.
hannah
a
better
position
than
any
other
creditor
there
may
be.
it
does
not
improve
her
position,
vis-à-vis
the
heirs
of
the
legatees,
and
it
certainly
does
not
improve
her
position,
vis-à-vis
the
respondent,
in
the
conduct
of
this
litigation.
therefore,
the
result
of
a
failure
to
reverse
the
courts
below
would
be
to
deprive
this
woman
of
a
chance
to
have
a
hearing
on
the
merits
of
her
claim.
it
would
be
the
beginning
of
the
destruction
of
certainty
and
uniformity
in
federal
procedure
and
there
would
be
no
corresponding
benefits
to
any
federal
or
congressional
policy.
we,
therefore
ask
this
court
not
to
deprive
the
petitioner
for
a
day
in
court
and
not
to
hang
a
millstone
on
the
federal
judiciary.
we
ask
that
the
decisions
of
the
court
below
be
reversed
and
this
cause
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
trial
on
the
merits.
may
i
have
five
minutes,
your
honor?
mr.
albert
p.
zabin
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
the
one
--
one
comment,
i
do
want
to
make
is
that,
without
belaboring
the
point
is
that
in
full,
the
stat
--
massachusetts
statute
as
far
as
timeliness
of
commencement
of
action
and
timeliness
of
service
was
in
fact
complied
with
and
that
the
single
aspect
of
that
litig
--
of
that
statute,
dealing
with
the
method
of
service
was
the
only
part
which
we
did
not
complied
with
and
the
--
this
notice
part
of
the
statute
is
not
as
my
brother
had
said
a
condition
precedent
to
the
maintenance
of
the
action.
the
first
circuit,
in
as
much,
decided
that
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
sacks
which
we've
cited
on
page
5
of
our
brief.
the
effect
of
reversing
the
decision
will
--
of
the
court
below
will
not
in
anyway
harm
the
policy
of
massachusetts.
it
will
not
give
any
outsider
a
right
which
a
local
resident
does
not
have
except
to
be
governed
by
the
more
modern
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
for
an
outsider,
of
course,
can
take
depositions
if
he
brings
his
action
to
the
federal
court,
which
he
cannot
do
if
he
brings
his
action
in
a
local
court
in
massachusetts.
and
yet
no
one
would
suggest
that
the
taking
of
depositions
was
a
substantive
right
within
the
meaning
of
the
enabling
act.
finally,
as
to
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
state
policy
is
a
legitimate
standard
for
determining
whether
or
not
the
application
of
a
federal
rule
has
transcended
the
rulemaking
power
of
this
court.
in
the
two
cases
in
which
the
terms
that
i
know
of,
in
which
the
term
"state
policy"
was
used,
cohen
versus
beneficial
loan
company
and
the
bernhardt
case,
the
term
"state
policy"
was
used
in
the
context
of
the
substantial
benefits
to
the
litigants
which
was
involved.
now,
in
cohen,
what
was
involved
there
was
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
be
secure
in
all
his
costs
in
maintaining
the
litigation,
counsel
fees
as
well
as
the
normal
court
cost
and
this
court
has
held
was
that
as
a
matter
of
--
was
a
substantive
right.
now,
there
is
no
equivalent
benefit
to
the
respondent
under
the
massachusetts
statute.
the
only
right
he
has,
if
it's
a
right
at
all,
is
the
right
to
have
the
service
given
to
him
directly
by
the
serving
officer
rather
than
have
it
being
given
to
him
by
