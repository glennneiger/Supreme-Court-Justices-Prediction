the
--
as
my
brother
goldberg
has
said,
the
interest
of
massachusetts
is
in
closing
up
an
estate
with
dispatch,
and
also
in
seeing
to
it
that
the
executor
administrator
have
prompt
notice
of
any
claims.
i

that's
ancillary
to
the

basic
policy.

here,
in

case,
there
was
no
question
about
the

by
massachusetts

executor
having

within

by
massachusetts
and
that
the
fiduciary
had
actual
notice
of
the
claim,
certainly
to
protect
himself
against
any
claims
by
the
beneficiaries
of
the
estate.
