(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
that
order,
he
enforces
does
he
not,
you're
arguing
that
this
motion
must
be
filed
within
a
specified
standards?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
are
you
saying
that
(inaudible)
provided

law?

mr.
duncan,
there
is
in
the
field
of
practical
difference
here,
though,
isn't
there
--
if
the
court
had
set
aside
the
adoption
judgment,
then
of
course,
the
party
seeking
adoption
would
have
had
to
go
forward
again
and
show
why
they
were
entitled
to
adoption,
the
burden
would
be
on
them.
but
in
the
hearing
that
you
get
under
the
texas
law
as
i
read
what
happened,
the
party
challenging
--
the
party
who
didn't
get
the
notice
was
to
come
in
and
file
his
motion
and
proceed
them
to
contest
the
ultimate
fact
upon
which
the
adoption
depends,
isn't
that
it?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
the
party
who
had
incurred
the
adoption
doesn't
go
forward
with
any
evidence
at
all
to
show
why
he
was
entitled
the
adoption
except
to
rebut
the
case
that
the
party
who
did
not
get
notice
puts
in,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
then
that's
really
the
difference.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you're
asking
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
said
that
the
failure
to
give
notice
here
was
of
the
state
which
i
assume
it
was.
how
do
you
explain
the
fact
that
several
cases
appeared
and
exist
in
texas
on
this
particular
problem
in
this
type
of
proceeding?
