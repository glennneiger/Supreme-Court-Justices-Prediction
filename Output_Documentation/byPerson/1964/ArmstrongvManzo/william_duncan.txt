mr.
william
duncan
if
the
court
please,
let
me
take
first
the
subject
of
what
happened
in
this
case
and
i'll
come
in
a
moment
to
talk
--
mr.
william
duncan
a
notice
certainly
should
have
been
given
here.
mr.
william
duncan
yes
sir.
and
in
this
case
--
mr.
william
duncan
no,
it
should
have
been
given
in
this
case
and
should
be
given
in
any
case
where
it's
physically
possible
in
any
manner
that
do
so.
and
we
suppose
that
the
error
that
was
made
in
this
case
in
that
regard
where
the
man
was
right
there
in
fort
worth
and
could
have
been
served.
the
error
that
was
made
here
arose
from
the
fact
that
our
party's
then
counsel
either
misconceived
of
what
the
cases
and
felt
that
they
could
go
ahead
and
get
a
judgment
that
would
be
good
or
for
some
reason
advised
the
people
to
go
ahead
without
notice.
but
that
was
an
error
because
the
texas
cases
are
clear
in
numerous
cases
that
that
judgment
was
only
good
until
it
came
into
question
by
the
party
whose
notice
had
been
omitted.
and
so
that's
what
took
place
here.
the
--
if
it
happened
that
this
new
father
of
the
child,
that
is
the
husband
of
the
mother
on
the
day
after
the
adoption
was
--
order
was
entered,
wrote
to
a
member
of
the
family,
the
father
of
the
petitioner
here
and
said,
“we've
taken
this
order
of
adoption
here
in
el
paso”.
and
our
party
was
the
commanding
officer
at
biggs
air
force
base.
and
let
me
say
right
here,
of
course
that
there
weren't
any
questions
about
the
fitness
of
the
parties
here.
it
didn't
even
come
in
to
question
when
the
full
hearing
was
had
because
there's
not
any
question
about
the
fitness
of
the
parties
here.
and
so
he
wrote
and
therefore,
the
petitioner
came
in
and
filed
a
--
what
was
first
hold,
a
motion
for
new
trial
or
a
motion
for
new
trial
and
a
motion
that
the
judgment
be
vacated.
now
in
regard
to
a
motion
for
new
trial,
we
are
talking
about
an
instrument
that
was
filed
and
called
a
motion
for
new
trial
as
a
name
or
a
motion
to
vacate
the
judgment.
but
what
actually
transpired
here
is
that
the
judge
set
down
for
a
hearing
the
motion
that
they
had
filed
and
then
postponed
the
hearing
on
it
so
that
the
parties
could
go
to
fort
worth
and
take
their
positions
and
on
a
date
certain,
set
the
motion
again.
and
then
the
parties
came
in
and
put
on
testimony
from
live
witnesses
and
from
deposition
witnesses
so
that
there
was
a
full
scale
hearing
where
the
judge
set
again
to
determine
the
facts
that
were
essential
or
in
issue
in
this
adoption.
mr.
william
duncan
that
is
--
what
is
of
--
we
say
the
record
shows
here,
your
honor
because
he
heard
the
testimony
just
as
the
texas
cases
said
that
he
must.
that
is
for
any
period
of
time
not
for
10
days
and
not
in
an
order
to
file
in
time
but
for
any
period
of
time
even
four
and
a
half
years
later.
beyond
this,
that's
the
limitation
period.
he
had
an
obligation
to
reopen
this
matter
on
a
motion
to
vacate
the
judgment
or
on
a
motion
to
determine
whether
there
was
nonsupport
or
whatever
you
call
the
motion.
mr.
william
duncan
the
order
of
proof?
the
record
shows
that
the
petitioner
came
in
and
called
his
witness
and
the
witnesses
and
put
on
testimony.
and
they
came
in
and
picked
up
the
burden
of
proof
if
we
may
say
it
that
way.
there
was
not
any
question
or
dispute
raised
then
about
who
had
the
burden
of
proof
or
who
would
rest
and
who
would
then
put
on
testimony
and
--
mr.
william
duncan
well,
they
picked
--
mr.
william
duncan
they
put
it
--
they
picked
up
the
burden
of
proof,
it
is
true.
mr.
william
duncan
yes
our
parties
put
on
the
evidence.
mr.
william
duncan
by
the
deposition
testimony
in
fort
worth,
there
was
a
full
inquiry
into
this
basic
question
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
duncan
no
sir.
if
we
say
that
was
not
an
issue,
wasn't
--
it
could
have
been
gone
into
but
it
wasn't
raised
by
any
party.
mr.
william
duncan
well,
it
was
because
of
course
as
the
record
will
show
here,
the
trial
court
initially
went
through
the
procedure
of
appointing
an
investigator
to
go
and
inquire
into
the
fitness
and
report
that
back
to
the
court,
and
so
forth
as
the
standard
texas
procedure.
mr.
william
duncan
yes
sir,
there
were
--
by
them
requested
findings
--
they
requested
findings
of
fact,
conclusions
of
law
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
william
duncan
yes,
they're
made
and
entered,
and
they're
in
the
record.
mr.
william
duncan
no
sir.
mr.
william
duncan
no
sir,
there
was
not.
the
record
doesn't
show
any
and
i
know
of
none
of
my
knowledge
which
is
second
hand
since
i
was
not
there
but
the
record
shows
if
they
came
in
and
picked
up
the
burden
of
proof.
and
it
is
a
fact
that
they
carried
the
burden.
but
this
was
a
trial
to
a
trial
judge
who
was
we
think
observing
the
texas
cases
to
give
them
what
the
cases
had
called
a
full
hearing.
and
in
one
--
as
the
cases
say,
a
full
hearing
inquiring
into
the
question
of
nonsupport
if
it's
a
nonsupport
case,
on
the
question
of
abandonment
if
it's
an
abandonment
case,
and
so
forth.
mr.
william
duncan
that
is
the
question
of
fitness?
mr.
william
duncan
no
sir.
mr.
william
duncan
there
was
not
any
matter
or
signs
specifically
to
the
court
of
civil
appeals
in
regard
to
the
burden
of
proof
and
no
writing
on
that
subject
that
i
recall
at
the
moment
in
the
court
of
civil
appeals.
mr.
william
duncan
no
sir,
except
the
cases
that
say
in
the
first
place
that
the
party
coming
in
to
prove
the
nonsupport
must
prove
it
by
fluent
satisfactory
evidence
or
proof
what
i
call
the
grounds
for
the
adoption
by
a
full
and
satisfactory
evidence.
mr.
william
duncan
well,
just
on
a
motion
if
the
court
had
nothing
to
apprise
if
the
--
mr.
william
duncan
well,
there
maybe
several
things
that
might
happen.
i
don't
know
what
would
happen
but
a
court
could
overrule
the
motion
or
could
sustain
the
motion
or
could
call
upon
the
party
to
treat
this
as
a
hearing
under
the
cases
--
mr.
william
duncan
well
if
we
had
a
affidavit
of
motion
as
we
have
for
instance
in
the
jury
misconduct
cases
where
you
come
in
and
show
the
court
something
that
would
justify
or
call
upon
him
to
go
into
evidence,
then
i
think
the
court
would
likely
rule
perhaps
on
the
motion
in
their
favor
if
it
were
just
a
motion
setting
out
unsworn
paragraphs,
i
would
assume
that
a
court
would
overrule
it.
mr.
william
duncan
well,
excuse
me,
i
was
con
--
i
was
answering
it
in
a
context
of
this
subject
of
nonsupport.
i
thought
--
i
--
for
my
part,
i
had
left
the
subject
of
notice.
if
it
came
back
in
and
here's
a
motion
that
says,
no
notice
was
given.
and
therefore
under
the
texas
cases,
the
court
has
a
burden
to
give
a
full
hearing.
then
of
course,
on
that
paragraph
of
the
motion,
it
should
be
sustained.
mr.
william
duncan
yes
sir,
the
motion
should
be
sustained
to
grant
a
new
trial
or
to
give
a
new
hearing,
give
a
--
the
full
hearing
that
the
texas
case
is
talking
--
mr.
william
duncan
yes
sir.
mr.
william
duncan
yes
sir.
mr.
william
duncan
no
sir.
mr.
william
duncan
well
i
didn't
mean
to
if
i
did,
your
honor.
the
--
it
is
true
that
here
on
the
mere
fact
that
no
notice,
the
court
did
not
set
aside
--
mr.
william
duncan
or
sustain
the
motion
for
new
trial.
the
court
did
not
do
that.
mr.
william
duncan
well
the
parties
came
in
and
had
witnesses
and
were
ready
to
go
in
to
a
trial
so
they
went
in
to
a
trial
and
they
put
on
live
testimony
and
took
the
day
and
so
forth.
mr.
william
duncan
it
was
not
set
aside.
the
motion
was
by
another
order
also
in
the
record,
overruled
and
the
judgment
confirmed
i
believe
was
the
word
that
the
court
used.
mr.
william
duncan
yes
sir.
mr.
william
duncan
yes
sir.
mr.
william
duncan
yes
sir
and
as
you
said,
there's
a
practical
difference
or
practical
problem
involved
and
that
was
also
in
the
fact
that
the
judges
are
human
and
maybe
they
are
inclined
to
say,
"well,
in
the
back
of
my
mind,
what
i'm
looking
for
here
is
evidence
to
support
my
prior
judgment".
i
realized
the
human
element
that
comes
into
it
there.
but
on
the
other
hand,
here
is
a
judge
who's
on
the
bench,
under
oath,
sitting
there
and
trying
a
nonjury
case
and
the
cases
have
told
him
inquire
into
a
--
by
a
full
hearing,
inquire
into
the
--
what
i
call
the
grounds
for
this
adoption.
mr.
william
duncan
well
i
think
it's
a
confusion
that
comes
up
even
to
good
lawyers
who
haven't
stop
to
think
about
it
as
i
have
them
too
much
but
the
difference
between
notice
and
consent,
a
statute
that
dispenses
with
consent
is
--
would
be
entirely
different
from
a
statute
that
attempted
to
dispense
with
notice.
that
you
can
conceive
a
case
where
a
man
had
been
given
no
--
had
been
given
notice.
and
he
comes
into
court
and
he
litigates
nonsupport
for
instance
or
abandonment.
and
he
winds
up
saying,
“judge,
i
don't
consent
to
this
adoption”.
and
the
judge
says,
“it
doesn't
matter.
this
is
grounds
for
adoption
and
i'm
going
to
grant
the
adoption”.
and
so
that
kind
of
confusion
in
just
day
to
day
practical
practicing
of
law
has
resulted
in
these
cases.
mr.
william
duncan
we
say
he
certainly
--
mr.
william
duncan
he
certainly
did,
your
honor.
mr.
william
duncan
no
sir.
mr.
william
duncan
yes,
sir,
it
would
have
been
necessary
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
william
duncan
and
--
mr.
william
duncan
because,
your
honor,
that
was
already
in
the
record
a
--
an
inquiry
that
the
court
had
had
made
under
the
texas
procedure
to
appoint
a
person
to
go
into
the
home
and
make
an
inquiry
in
regard
to
--
on
the
ground
in
regard
to
the
circumstances
of
the
parents
and
so
forth.
mr.
william
duncan
well,
there'll
be
--
mr.
william
duncan
well
it's
true,
your
honor,
there
was
no
testimony
put
on
in
the
full
hearing
but
it
was
in
the
record
--
in
the
papers
in
the
case,
in
the
district
court's
office
in
this
lawsuit
that
the
father
came
in
to
--
that
here
was
a
report
of
the
investigator.
so
that
if
that
report
or
the
record
on
--
already
on
the
case
on
which
the
court
had
found
the
fitness
of
this
adoptive
father,
if
that
were
to
be
put
an
issue,
it
could
have
been
litigated
in
this
but
it
was
not
put
in
issue.
mr.
william
duncan
well,
that
is
correct
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
duncan
yes
sir.
mr.
william
duncan
yes
sir.
and
what
i
--
mr.
william
duncan
i
can't
cite
your
case
on
it
but
i
believe
the
law
in
texas
is
that
on
that
particular
subject,
that
he
would
have
had
a
burden
in
any
case
to
show
the
unfitness
--
just
as
a
subject
of
unfitness
of
the
husband
--
of
the
mother
to
be
an
adoptive
parent
of
the
child.
mr.
william
duncan
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
duncan
well
i
said
it
wrong
then
your
honor.
all
i
meant
to
say
was
that
in
texas,
the
adoptions
of
the
new
family
are
said
by
some
of
the
judges
in
courts
to
be
favored.
that's
all
i
meant
to
say
there.
i
don't
mean
that
--
mr.
william
duncan
yes
sir.
mr.
william
duncan
yes
sir.
mr.
william
duncan
that
states
it,
i
believe,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
duncan
yes
sir,
there
wasn't
any
express
shifting
of
the
burden
of
proof
but
that
--
mr.
william
duncan
that's
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
duncan
that
did
result
here.
mr.
william
duncan
that
shifting
of
the
burden
resulted
in
this
case
but
--
mr.
william
duncan
yes
sir.
and
of
course,
what
we
say
is
that
he
had
a
full
and
fair
hearing
satisfying
the
law.
mr.
william
duncan
there's
a
good
deal
down
in
any
case
as
to
--
mr.
william
duncan
yes
sir.
mr.
william
duncan
we're
strong
on
jury
trials
in
texas
and
--
mr.
william
duncan
and
--
mr.
william
duncan
under
this
procedure,
i
think
that
he
could
have
because
this
was
not
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
this
was
not
treated
as
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
william
duncan
yes
sir.
mr.
william
duncan
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
that
if
the
parties
had
come
in
and
said,
"your
honor,
this
is
a
subject,
that's
a
question
of
fact".
in
texas
the
minute
you
say
question
of
fact
and
i
want
a
jury,
you
nearly
got
it
made,
--
mr.
william
duncan
--
your
honors.
