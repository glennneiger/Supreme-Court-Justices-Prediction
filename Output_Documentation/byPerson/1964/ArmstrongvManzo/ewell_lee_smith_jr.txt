mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
it
is
a
very
high
professional
honor
for
me
to
appear
before
this
court.
i'd
like
to
say
at
the
beginning
that
i'm
fully
aware
of
the
importance
of
the
question
to
the
jurisprudence
of
our
country
to
be
decided
here
today.
i
hope
i
may
be
of
assistance
to
the
court
and
that
i
may
do
justice
to
the
cause
of
my
client.
this
is
an
adoption
case,
first
to
be
considered
by
this
court
on
adoption
validity.
it
is
important
i
think
because
we
are
mobile
people,
historically
on
the
move
and
adoptions
have
become
very
numerous.
it
is
important
because
it
involves
domestic
law,
one
of
the
chief
categories
of
the
law
since
the
code
of
hammurabi
and
before.
there
are
two
points
involved
and
two
of
them.
first
at
section
6
of
article
46a,
texas'
revised
statutes
is
constitution
because
it
purports
to
dispense
with
the
consent
of
natural
parents
in
an
adoption
proceeding
without
any
provision
for
notice.
secondly,
that
we
have
been
deprived
of
due
process
of
the
law
that
the
failure
of
the
texas
courts
to
give
notice
to
the
natural
father
of
a
proceeding
to
adopt
his
child.
not
only
do
i
appear
here
in
a
representative
capacity
for
the
bench
and
the
bar
but
our
petition
for
a
simple,
direct,
and
specific
justice.
i
shall
address
myself
first
to
the
facts,
secondly
to
the
procedural
facts,
thirdly
to
the
law,
and
lastly
to
the
possible
and
actual
consequences
of
harm
from
this
action.
my
client
was
made
rather
late
in
life.
he
is
the
natural
father
of
but
one
child,
a
girl,
the
subject
of
this
adoption.
his
wife
who
had
been
married
once
before
and
had
mothered
and
lost
the
custody
of
two
children
by
her
former
husband,
divorced
him
in
fort
worth,
texas
in
november
of
1959
and
received
custody
of
his
only
child
subject
to
the
usual
rights
of
reasonable
visitation
in
my
client.
at
the
time
of
the
divorce,
my
client
suffered
complete
physical
and
mental
breakdown.
he
was
carried
to
the
hospital
by
his
just
divorced
wife.
he
was
not
to
recover
from
this
condition
for
over
a
year.
his
former
wife
had
been
moved
to
el
paso,
texas
some
550
miles
west
of
fort
worth
and
within
four
months
after
the
divorce,
remade
for
the
third
time
to
a
mr.
manzo,
a
divorced
man
with
three
smaller
children.
she
took
with
her
molly,
age
three,
the
child
of
my
client
is
subject
to
this
case.
now
my
client
mr.
armstrong
is
a
native
of
fort
worth,
texas.
he's
lived
there
for
over
40
years.
his
parents
have
lived
there
for
many
years
before
him
and
all
are
well-known.
texas
has
an
adoption
statute
which
provides
among
other
things
that
no
child
maybe
adopted
without
the
consent
of
his
natural
parents
unless
such
parent
or
parents
shall
have
voluntarily
abandoned
said
child
for
two
years
and
shall
have
left
the
child
to
the
care,
custody,
and
control
of
others,
or
in
the
disjunctive,
such
parent
shall
not
have
contributed
substantially
to
the
support
of
such
child
during
such
period
of
two
years,
commensurate
with
his
financial
ability.
it
is
the
second
of
this
that
we're
concerned
with
here
today.
when
he
was
divorced,
my
client
was
ordered
to
pay
$50
a
month
child
support
beginning
november
16th,
1959.
it
is
undisputed
that
he
paid
as
total
sum
of
$200.
this
would
have
carried
him
from
november
16th,
1959
up
until
march
the
16th,
1960,
some
four
months.
the
trial
court
and
the
appellate
court
by
some
subjective
or
otherwise
unascertainable
standard,
even
though
the
divorce
was
not
decided
until
november
6,
1959
and
the
payments
were
not
to
begin
until
november
16th,
1959,
decided
that
the
payments
were
for
--
from
november
the
1st,
the
date
prior
to
the
divorce
itself.
and
therefore,
two
years
from
the
four-month
period
ending
march
the
1st
the
court
said,
section
2
of
the
statute
came
into
operation,
he
had
not
--
if
he
had
not
supported
the
child
commensurate
with
his
financial
ability
from
that
period
on,
then
they
had
jurisdiction.
this
was
the
first,
and
in
my
judgment,
most
fundamental
jurisdictional
decision
made
by
a
series
of
texas
courts
apparently
calculated
to
reason
around
or
to
ignore
constitutional
rights
and
guarantees
a
due
process.
if
the
court
please,
i
think
it
was
a
studied
attempt
to
run
this
adoption
through
against
the
wishes
of
his
father
without
notice
to
him.
now,
let
me
make
it
clear
now
that
this
is
not
a
custody
case
and
again
the
classical
sense
of
that
term.
there
should
have
been
no
issue
concerning
the
welfare
of
the
child
in
his
adoption
in
the
beginning.
custody
was
with
the
mother
by
decree
of
the
district
court
of
tarrant
county,
texas.
the
father
did
have
limited
custody.
this
limited
custody
consisted
of
a
court
order
giving
him
reasonable
visitation
at
reasonable
times.
i
mentioned
that
because
although
it's
not
classically
custody,
it
does
have
elements
of
custody
in
it.
the
issue
here
is
simply,
whether
a
court
can
completely
cut
the
man
off
from
his
own
child
without
even
the
right
of
visitation,
taking
away
his
name,
his
heritage,
his
parentage,
terminating
if
the
court
please
in
the
words
of
section
9
of
the
statute,
all
legal
relationship,
all
rights
and
duties,
all
against
his
will
without
even
notice.
the
procedural
facts
are
as
follows.
with
one
small
capsule
of
time
on
march
the
12th,
1962,
three
events
took
place.
first,
the
mother
filed
at
two
sentence
self-serving
affidavit,
alleging
nonsupport
of
the
child
for
two
years.
this
was
filed
in
120th
district
court
in
el
paso.
on
the
same
day,
the
judge
of
the
41st
district
court
next
door
found
nonsupport
solely
on
the
basis
of
his
self-serving
two
sentence
affidavit
and
granted
his
consent.
now,
i
neglected
to
say
that
if
these
two
events
come
to
pass
in
the
statute
then
the
parental
consent
shall
not
be
necessary
but
the
consent
of
the
juvenile
judge
or
the
judge
of
the
county
court
if
there
is
no
juvenile
judge
shall
be
necessary.
so
the
judge
of
the
41st
district
court
on
the
two
sentence
affidavit
gave
his
consent
to
the
adoption
which
had
meanwhile
then
filed
in
the
120th
court
on
the
same
day.
all
of
these
three
events
took
place
on
march
the
12th,
1962.
no
inquiry
was
made
concerning
mr.
armstrong's
whereabouts.
no
notice
of
any
kind
was
given
him.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i
mean
no
notice
whatsoever,
no
publication,
no
letters
as
in
the
mullane
case,
no
letter.
no
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
he
did
not
have
any
knowledge.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
we
did.
i
want
to
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
he
got
a
full
hearing
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
if
that
can
be
considered
a
hearing
which
comports
with
my
concept
to
what
this
court
has
said
about
due
process
and
i
don't
think
it
does.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
possibly,
your
honor.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
evidence
was
taken.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
that
you
can
search
this
record
in
vain
for
any
evidence
as
to
the
fitness
or
as
to
the
welfare
of
the
child.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
this
kind
of
evidence
was
taken.
the
father
testified
that
he
had
a
complete
physical
and
mental
breakdown.
he
was
under
the
care
of
a
doctor.
he
was
not
to
recover
from
this
for
over
two
months
--
i
mean
for
over
six
months.
he
for
a
while
had
a
temporary
job
as
assistant
city
prosecutor
in
fort
worth.
he
was
so
nervous
and
so
mentally
ill
that
he
could
not
hold
this
job
down.
the
testimony
further
was
that
he
earned
a
total
of
$650
i
believe
it
was
in
that
year,
probably
more
than
next
year.
the
deposition
of
his
doctor
was
introduced.
this
deposition
showed
that
beyond
any
question,
he
had
a
nervous
breakdown,
a
mental
illness,
and
the
doctor
said
he
would
be
surprised
if
he
recovered
from
any
less
from
his
condition
any
less
than
six
months
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
nonsupport
commensurate
with
his
financial
ability.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
all
the
testimony
was
directed
toward
that
facti
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
the
hearing
of
course
was
the
purpose
is
as
we
see
it,
the
motion
for
new
trial
was
filed
to
completely
set
aside
this
proceeding,
to
show
that
the
evidence
which
the
court
based
his
decision
upon
was
not
sufficient
evidence
to
make
this
decision.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
but
the
constitutional
question
was
raised
also.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
no,
your
honor
except
to
show
the
--
there
was
evidence
put
on
to
show
the
stealthy
manner
in
which
the
thing
was
conducted
that
they
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
no,
justice
white,
not
a
full
opportunity.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
because
he
had
the
burden
of
proof
where
he
would
not
have
had
to
put
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
no
question
that
he
could
have
put
on
any
evidence
that
the
court
would
have
allowed
him
to
take.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
sir?
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
well,
on
the
technical
attack,
on
the
evidence
itself,
the
court
completely
ignored
the
constitutional
ground.
now
i
say
this,
under
our
procedure,
and
while
we're
on
this
point
although
i
intended
to
get
to
it
later,
we
might
as
well
take
it
out
now.
under
section
7
of
the
adoption
act,
an
adoption
can
be
attacked
if
the
adoptive
parents
can
be
shown
to
be
immoral,
a
severe
thing,
that's
not
in
the
issue
here.
another
means
of
attack
is
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
which
we've
already
discussed
here.
another
means
of
possible
attack
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
your
honor,
there
are
eight
different
ways
that
this
motion
for
new
a
trial
is
more
burdensome.
of
course
i
don't
think
i
need
to
--
i'll
going
to
answer
those
eight
things
but
i
think
it's
self-evident
to
anybody
who's
ever
handled
a
case
that
he'd
rather
go
in
and
that
his
rights
are
fuller
having
a
mere
preponderance
of
the
evidence
than
to
have
to
upset
the
burden
of
proof
and
to
convince
a
trial
judge
that
he
did
a
thing
which
was
abusive
in
the
first
place.
so
i
think
it's
self-evident
that
this
hearing
was
not
equivalent
to
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
well,
firstly
i
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
firstly
i'll
say
this
that
if
the
statute
provided
for
notice,
that
would
go
a
long
way
to
accruing
this
up.
and
if
he
--
if
the
--
the
case
has
hold
in
other
states
that
the
legislature
has
the
right
to
say
under
what
conditions
parental
right
shall
be
exercised.
but
i
don't
know
that
the
state
has
a
right
to
arbitrarily
asses
a
burden
of
proof
any
way
it
wants
to.
i
don't
think
it
does.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
procedurally,
he
can't
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
he's
got
to
settle
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
well
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
i
don't
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
alright
sir.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
let
me
put
some
of
the
incidents
of
a
motion
for
new
trial
under
our
practice
before
the
court.
i
think
it
would
be
germane
to
this
point.
the
ex
parte
proceeding
must
be
discovered
within
10
days.
the
motion
must
be
filed
within
10
days.
in
a
nonjury
case,
no
motion
for
new
trial
has
to
be
filed
as
a
prerequisite
to
appeal.
so
30
days
later,
the
judgment
is
filed.
the
person
moving
for
a
new
trial
has
a
burden
of
proof
to
set
aside
whereas
the
adoptive
parents
would
have
had
the
burden
on
proper
notice.
third,
we
now
have
the
burden
of
convincing
the
judge
that
he
did
an
unfair
thing
in
the
first
place
and
not
giving
us
notice.
fourth,
the
legal
presumption
is
that
the
best
interest
of
the
child
lies
in
its
own
natural
parents.
this
is
the
law
in
every
state.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
the
natural
parents.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
yes
sir
but
nevertheless
the
natural
parents,
even
though
they'd
be
separated
by
divorce.
the
legal
presumption
is
in
my
state,
and
i
think
it's
the
law
of
all
states
that
the
natural
parents
have
the
best
interest
of
the
child
at
heart.
now,
in
addition
to
have
a
greater
burden,
we
are
deprived
of
this
presumption
if
we
go
on
in
a
motion
for
new
trial.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
the
adoptive
parents
are
now
the
parents
therefore
no
presumption
operates
in
favor
of
the
natural
parents
who
have
been
deprived
of
all
rights
from
this
child.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
one
natural
parent
has.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
now
this
is
a
divisible
thing
as
i
mentioned
in
the
beginning.
custody,
nominally
is
with
the
mother
but
custody
is
also
with
the
father.
we
have
the
right
to
visit
this
child.
the
record
shows
that
in
this
two
year
period
ensuing
from
the
divorce
until
the
time
of
the
adoption,
the
child
visited
for
four
extended
visits
in
fort
worth
of
a
month
at
a
time.
this
is
custody.
this
is
a
thing
we've
been
cut
off
from.
this
is
the
thing
that
we
have
no
presumption
in
our
favor
regardless
on
a
motion
for
new
trial.
and
also
under
our
texas
rule
329b,
the
judge
doesn't
even
have
to
give
us
a
hearing
on
a
motion
for
new
trial.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
he
doesn't
have
to
give
a
hearing
on
the
motion
for
new
trial.
he
can
just
say,
“i
overrule
it”.
this
is
a
prerequisite
for
appeal,
i
overrule
it.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
that's
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
let
me
answer
the
first
question
in
this
way,
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
--
that's
right.
the
second
question
is
at
the
law
of
texas,
no
sir.
i
don't
know
what
the
law
of
texas
is.
i'd
pointed
out
here
that
he's
so
confused
that
he
needs
this
court's
clarification
on
this
point
--
court
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
i
understand
except
on
notice,
your
honor.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
as
this
court
said
in
grannis
versus
ordean,
state
court
decisions
are
not
binding
on
this
court
concerning
fourteenth
amendment.
now
actually,
procedurally,
a
party
who
was
not
a
party
to
the
original
adoption
proceeding
has
no
standing
to
file
a
motion
for
new
trial.
he
has
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
but
there's
no
assurance
that
it'll
be
given
to
him
if
this
is
to
substitute
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
--
for
due
process,
it's
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
i
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
was
said
in
this
court
yesterday
that
this
defendant
and
any
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
trial
under
the
constitution
within
the
meaning
of
due
process.
now
i
submit
to
the
court
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
no
sir
and
i
say
this
too,
it's
been
brought
up
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
well,
this
court
said
in
mullane
that
the
first
fundamental
was
adequacy
of
notice.
and
this
court
said
in
roller
versus
holly
and
in
walker
versus
hutchinson,
that
notice
adequate
under
all
circumstances
was
important.
what
if
this
man
had
been
living
not
in
fort
worth
within
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
within
el
paso?
could
they
ignore
giving
him
notice?
what
if
instead
of
just
being
in
el
paso,
he'd
been
living
next
door?
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
i
remember
that
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
yes
sir.
alright.
now
the
question
is
if
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
which
case,
your
honor?
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
lee
and
purvin?
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
well
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
this
is
the
most
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
this
lee
and
purvin
is
the
most
confused
case.
all
the
cases
of
a
similar
nature
are
confused.
the
courts
have
come
along
now.
the
basis
on
dewitt
versus
brooks
which
was
a
supreme
court
case,
it
seems
to
be
unquoted,
and
misquoted,
and
misapplied
and
the
courts
have
said
with
the
tongue-in-cheek
attitude
including
lee
versus
purvin,
we
don't
--
we
have
some
question
about
whether
this
procedure
is
right
or
not.
but
it
was
once
said
by
the
supreme
court
in
dewitt
versus
brooks
therefore
we're
going
to
follow
it.
now
i
submit
that
a
judgment
is
a
final
judgment.
you
might
as
well
put
a
man
in
jail
and
say,
“alright,
let's
have
a
hearing
and
see
whether
he
gets
out
or
not”.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
true
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
page
15,
yes
sir.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
that's
right
your
honor
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
must
be
filed
within
10
days
and
if
a
hearing
is
not
granted
on
a
motion
within
10
days,
it's
overruled
by
operation
of
the
law.
actually
a
motion
for
new
trial
is
a
procedural
device
so
there's
no
guarantee
to
anybody.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
it's
illusory,
your
honor
as
it
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
i'm
glad
you've
asked
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
i'm
glad
you've
asked
me
about
that,
your
honor.
i'm
very
glad
you
asked
about
that.
that's
cited
by
the
opponent.
i
think
just
a
cursory
glance
of
that
case
will
indicate
what
i'm
talking
about.
look
at
the
special
issue
which
are
raised
in
that
case,
when
the
mother
comes
in,
not
having
been
given
notice
to
set
aside
one
of
these
things
before
jury.
the
jury
has
asked,
“do
you
find
from
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
she
did
not
fail
to
support
this
child?”
commensurate
with
her
financial
ability
for
two
years.
do
you
find
from
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
she
did
not
surrender
the
care
or
custody
and
control
of
the
child
for
a
period
of
two
years?
i
think
that
case
indicates
how
onerous
this
burden
of
proof
is.
and
while
i'm
discussing
the
cases
that
are
raised
by
our
opponent,
i
want
to
talk
about
this
(inaudible),
which
is
a
case
that
came
out
after
we
filed
our
brief
here
cited
by
them.
where
a
person
in
this
situation,
a
father
who
was
not
a
party
to
the
original
proceeding
tried
to
bring
this
question
up
by
a
writ
of
error,
an
application
for
writ
of
error
to
the
court
of
civil
appeals
from
the
court
of
civil
appeals
to
the
district
court.
and
our
position
cites
this
as
showing
that
the
--
that
he
had
a
remedy
below.
but
if
the
court
would
read
that
case,
he
doesn't
say
that
at
all.
it
says,
he
may
perhaps
have
some
remedy
below.
we
don't
know
but
it's
not
by
a
write
--
writ
of
error.
now
the
reason
they
said,
he
had
no
right
to
go
out
by
writ
of
error,
was
that
he
was
not
a
party
to
the
original
proceeding
which
gives
me
back
to
the
point
on
this
motion
for
new
trial.
ordinarily,
in
any
kind
of
case,
a
person
who
is
not
a
party
to
a
lawsuit
can't
come
in
by
way
of
motion
for
new
trial.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
the
court
of
civil
appeals
turned
it
down
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
they
said
we
have
no
jurisdiction
to
issue
a
writ
of
error
to
the
trial
court
because
this
man
was
not
a
party
to
that
suit.
and
while
he
made
perhaps
have
some
remedy
this
isn't
it.
i
think
the
same
would
apply
to
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
way
you
can
come
at
these
things
is
either
by
a
motion
for
new
trial
or
a
writ
of
-
an
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
or
an
equitable
bill
of
review.
i
submit
all
of
these
inadequate.
all
of
them
are
more
onerous
than
a
trial
upon
notice
in
the
first
place
although
there
are
variations
in
these
three
procedures.
they're
all
more
onerous.
now,
any
day
now
i
expect
that
we
can
see
the
courts
of
texas
come
out
following
(inaudible)
and
say
you
have
no
standing
to
come
in
by
a
motion
for
new
trial.
so
you'd
be
relegated
to
an
application
for
habeas
corpus.
now
i
think
this,
if
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
the
burden
is
on
the
moving
party,
your
honor
and
it's
a
strenuous
one.
in
an
application
for
an
equitable
bill
of
review,
you've
not
only
got
to
show
all
these
other
things
but
you
got
to
show
a
present,
meritorious
defense.
and
in
a
case
of
a
child
custody
case,
if
the
child
has
been
in
the
custody
of
the
adoptive
parents
for
three
years,
due
to
an
unconstitutional
act
of
the
trial
court,
then
you
got
a
different
question
when
you'd
come
up
on
a
motion
for
bill
of
review.
what
is
your
present
meritorious
defense?
what
is
the
best
answers
to
the
child
who
was
taken
from
the
mom
like
for
three
years?
i'd
say
it
in
conclusion
that
the
law,
on
most
states
so
far
as
i've
been
able
to
find
them
comports
with
what
we've
said
in
our
brief.
this
is
the
law
in
missouri.
this
is
the
law
in
illinois
as
said
to
deprive
a
parent
of
his
rights
without
notice,
an
opportunity
is
not
only
contrary,
they
have
a
principle
of
natural
justice
but
is
prohibited
by
the
constitution,
california
has
said
it.
it
happens
in
state
unquestionably
due
process
of
law
demands
some
sufficient
notice
to
the
parents
or
the
proceeding
about
to
be
taken
where
the
opportunity
to
the
parents
to
be
heard
upon
the
issues.
north
dakota
said
it,
all
of
these
cases
are
cases
where
there's
an
exception
to
parental
consent.
these
states
say
if
he's
insane,
a
guardian
ad
litem
must
be
appointed
to
protect
his
interest.
if
he's
in
prison,
someone
has
to
come
in
and
show
that
fact.
whatever
the
legislature
has
provided,
the
constitution
requires
notice.
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
i
might
just
say
one
or
two
things
in
conclusion,
your
honor.
he
could
not
have
had
a
jury,
mr.
justice
brennan.
on
this
procedure,
it's
a
motion
for
new
trial,
it's
a
procedural
length
--
mr.
ewell
lee
smith,
jr.
--
to
allow
those
sayings.
i
just
want
to
say
in
closing
that
in
may
versus
anderson
that
the
parent
cannot
be
deprived
on
the
precious
right
of
custody
without
notice
then
a
fortiori
in
this
type
of
case.
i
want
to
say
under
the
rule
of
fairness
as
this
court
set
it
out
in
the
mullane
case,
not
even
publication
would
have
been
sufficient
here
where
the
defendant,
defendant's
address
was
known.
he
was
--
went
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
and
where
the
party's
concealed
from
him
or
at
least
conducted
himself
so
he
would
receive
no
notice.
and
i
do
want
to
say
that
mr.
duncan
was
not
counsel
at
that
time.
