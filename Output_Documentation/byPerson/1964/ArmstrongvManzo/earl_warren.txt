chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
open
to
him
on
a
motion
for
new
trial?
is
there
a
shift,
the
burden
of
proof
or
anything
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
duncan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
this
man
had
come
in
and
made
his
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
set
the
fact,
and
then
offered
no
evidence,
what
would
have
happened
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
made
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
now
you
were
totally
been
talking
about
the
burden
of
proof.
you
made
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
fixed
a
date
for
the
hearing
and
he
comes
in
there
and
sits
down,
and
see
what's
--
see
if
it's
going
to
be
and
--
he
doesn't
offer
any
testimony
right
there.
what
would
happen?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
the
court
would
sustain
its
motion
without
having
sustained
his
motion
without
him
putting
on
any
evidence
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
duncan,
may
i
ask
you,
did
this
man
as
a
matter
of
fact,
have
a
full
and
complete
trial
on
all
the
issues
involved
in
the
adoption
of
this
child
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
the
consent.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
was
there
any
testimony
at
all
introduced
concerning
the
fitness
of
either
party
at
this
second
hearing,
at
this
hearing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
in
order
to
support
a
finding
for
the
adoption,
would
it
not
have
been
essential
for
the
court
to
find
in
the
first
instance
that
these
people
were
fit
to
adopt
the
child?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
first
instance.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
if
he
had
a
complete
new
trial,
why
didn't
the
court
go
into
the
question
with
fitness?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
wasn't
been
in
the
adversary
proceeding.
he
has
no
notice
of
any
kind
of
that
proceeding
and
then
you
say,
well
after
he
gave
his
notice
of
motion
for
a
new
trial,
you
gave
him
a
complete
hearing
and
the
court
disposed
off
the
case
on
that
hearing
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
there
was
nothing
in
there,
you
tell
me
that
had
to
do
with
the
fitness
for
the
child.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
said
it
was
a
complete
new
trial
and
one
of
the
issues
to
be
determined
is
the
fitness
of
these
prospective
parents.
and
in
this
hearing,
there
was
absolutely
nothing.
and
the
only
evidence
that
was
in
the
record
was
that
which
the
court
had
at
the
time
when
he
had
no
notice
of
a
proceeding.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
that
the
gist
of
it,
there
was
a
burden
on
him
to
do
certain
things
that
he
didn't
have
to
do
on
the
first
trial,
and
that's
one
of
the
weaknesses
of
your
position.
it
seems
to
me
that
he
did
have
accordance
to
move
forward
and
to
do
certain
things
in
the
second
proceeding
which
he
didn't
have
to
burden
the
first
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i've
had
had
somewhat
experience
in
adoption
proceedings
in
my
own
state
but
i
always
thought
that
one
of
the
principle
issues
in
the
case
was
to
prove
the
fitness
of
the
adopting
parents.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
think
that
it's
a
--
it's
the
burden
of
anyone
else
to
prove
they're
unfit.
i
think
that
an
adopting
parent
is
supposed
to
prove
that
he's
fit
for
that
child.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
we've
got
a
confused
situation
there.
