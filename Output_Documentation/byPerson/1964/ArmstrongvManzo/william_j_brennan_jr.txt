justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
my
theory
had
resulted
from
that
hearing
a
setting
aside
of
the
order
of
adoption?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
mean
with
evidence
taken
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
bearing
on
the
fitness
of
the
adoptive
parents
and
all
those
other
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
happened
at
the
hearing?
what
kind
of
evidence
was
taken?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
what
issue
was
that
evidence
directed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
that
--
was
that
the
only
purpose
of
the
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
on
the
issue
of
nonsupport,
it
may
not
have
been
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
the
other
--
or
that
--
that
whether
other
factual
issues
to
which
evidence
show
--
was
directed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
smith,
(inaudible)
if
i
may
say
so
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
actually
happened
here,
that
whether
they
complied
as
they
should
have
or
not,
that
they
did
at
least
attempt
to
comply
with
the
rule
laid
down
in
the
case
of
this
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
that
mr.
justice
stewart
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
--
are
you
--
you've
just
said
to
us
that
the
husband
here
had
no
standing
to
ask
for
a
new
trial
because
he
wasn't
a
party
of
the
proceeding
and
that
he
did
get
a
hearing
maybe
it
wasn't
an
adequate
hearing
but
he
did
get
a
hearing.
and
that
i'm
--
if
i
may
say
so
looks
to
me
is
though
they
attempted
at
least
to
comply
with
the
rule
of
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
the
lee
and
purvin
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
in
effect
you're
saying
is
whatever
they
gave
you
here,
they
didn't
vacate,
let's
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
original
judgment
can
start
all
over
again.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
put
on
you
all
the
burden
starting
with
the
presumption,
the
validity
of
the
original
adoption
order
and
put
on
you
the
whole
burden
of
justifying
it
being
set
aside.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
far
did
he
get
to
the
court
of
civil
appeals
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
by
that,
that
he
did
it
as
if
there
had
never
been
an
order
of
adoption
was
reentered?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
this,
mr.
duncan.
is
this
the
question
we
have
to
decide
if
the
failure
to
give
notice
was
a
constitutional,
federal
constitutionally
infirmity
in
the
proceedings,
can
that
infirmity
be
redressed
short
of
scrubbing
the
whole
slate
clean
in
giving
a
brand
--
starting
a
brand
new
proceeding.
isn't
that
the
issue
before
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
duncan,
i'm
just
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
curios,
i
noticed
in
johnston,
there
was
a
jury
trial
in
this
issue
but
the
nonjury
trial
here
--
couldn't
the
petitioner
have
asked
for
a
jury
trial
on
this
motion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright
fine.
i'm
all
for
it,
i
think
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
could
he
have
had
one
if
he
asked
for
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
noticed
in
johnston
though,
they
picked
up
separate
issues
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
four
of
them
i
think
in
--
they
went
to
the
jury.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
fine.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
was
in
johnston
too
as
i
read
that
opinion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not
important.
i
just
