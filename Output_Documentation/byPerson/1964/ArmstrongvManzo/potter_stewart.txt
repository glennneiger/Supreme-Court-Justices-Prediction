living
parents
are
without
notice

do
not
give
written
consent
to
such
an
adoption
they
must
be
allowed
a
full
hearing
in
a
subsequent
proceeding
on
the
issue
of
whether
sufficient
facts
existed
as
to
authorize
the
entry
of
the
judgment
of
adoption.

we
understand
it,

the
holding
of
the
previous
case.

this
case,
they
did
reverse
the
judgment
of
adoption
and
sent
it
back
to

for
a
