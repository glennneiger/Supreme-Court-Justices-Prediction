justice

did
he
get
approval
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
smith,
i
hope
you
--
when
you
get
to
argue
on
the
assumption
that
the
court
would
hold
that
he's
entitled
to
notice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
could
he
in
this
fashion,
suppose
the
law
of
texas,
has
been
said
to
be
this
or
it
happened
in
this
case,
the
judge
had
said,
â€œalright,
i
--
they
issued
this
without
notice.
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
now
to
try
exactly
as
you've
tried
it
before.
i'm
going
to
keep
the
burden
upon
the
person
who
makes
the
charges.
i'm
going
to
let
you
offer
any
evidence
whatever
show
that
the
--
to
disadvantage
of
the
child
and
invades
the
rights
of
the
party.
now,
the
door
is
open,
go
ahead
and
prove
it".
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
procedurally.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
should
think
a
judge
could
do
that
procedurally
in
any
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
could
say
on
this
motion
for
a
new
trial,
i'm
going
to
look
at
it
on
its
merits
again
to
see
about
it.
but
suppose
he
can,
did
they
do
that
here
and
if
not,
before
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
point
out
why
they
didn't
forgetting
the
original
fact
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
there
was
no
notice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
aren't
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't
he
have
the
same
presumption
you
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
natural
parent
has
not
been
deprived
of.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
doesn't
have
to
give
you
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
didn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
can't
just
treat
it
as
a
technical
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
because
they
didn't
give
notice
originally
even
though
it's
unconstitutional.
we've
got
a
case
where
your
court
conceded
that
as
i
understand
it.
and
then
said
that
he
had
the
full
opportunity
and
full
--
was
given
full
opportunity
to
try
it
all
over
and
they
did
tried
all
over
and
that
--
then
they
sustained
the
judgment
on
the
fact
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
question
is
--
does
--
did
you
have
that
kind
of
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
go
through
all
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
keep
going
back
to
the
--
just
the
fact,
you
said
they
didn't
have
notice
at
that
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
here
we
have
a
second
time
where
he
did
have
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
have
to
argue
but
to
me
on
that
point.
i
don't
know
about
the
rest
of
the
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
deny
--
firstly,
do
you
deny
that
a
father
is
entitled
or
a
mother
entitled
to
notice
for
that
child
who
was
adopted
by
somebody
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
issue
is
not
between
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
supposed
it
showed
there
was
no
notice,
(inaudible)?
find
that
enough
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
should
have
been
set
aside.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whatever
was
--
that
would
in
effect
as
i
understand
it,
set
aside
the
former
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
to
a
new
trial,
of
course,
he
would've
been
if
the
notice
was
unconstitutional,
wouldn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
don't
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
reference
to
that
as
i
understand
you
to
say,
under
the
law
of
texas,
under
this
case,
although
a
moving
party
would've
had
to
go
forward
in
their
case
the
first
time,
the
judgment
was
not
to
say
--
to
set
aside
and
a
new
trial
given
under
the
same
circumstances
before
which
shifted
the
burden
of
proof
to
him.
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
what
the
result
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
must
consider
the
any
man
would
avoid
judgment
against
him
because
of
an
unconstitutional
to
say
--
to
give
notice.
he
didn't
have
its
original
trial.
the
law
of
texas
say,
"you
should
never
have
that
kind
of
original
trial
again",
even
though
the
--
either
the
--
there
was
no
notice
given
in
the
first
case.
he
can't
have
it
because
the
burden
is
on
the
other
person
--
becomes
on
you
when
it
wouldn't
have
been
at
first.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
--
whatever
it's
resulted
from,
the
result
is
that
it
resulted
because
of
your
law
down
there
as
i
understand
it
which
is
as
mr.
justice
stewart
read
from
the
record.
but
you
have
it,
a
situation
where
if
this
judgment
ignored
the
lack
of
notice
as
i
don't
mind
saying,
i
have
--
instead
of
a
belief,
its
probably
is,
the
result
is
that
the
--
you
didn't
give
him
the
same
kind
of
trial
he
would've
had
gotten,
same
kind
of
it
then
take
his
trial
had
he
been
the
defendant
in
the
original
case.
he
couldn't
get
it
that
way
because
he
became
in
effect
the
moving
party
in
a
new
trial.
and
we
have
to
consider
it
that
way,
do
we
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
the
full
and
fair
hearing
even
though
by
reason
of
having
him
failed
to
give
notice
in
the
beginning.
even
though
for
that
reason,
the
burden
is
shifted
that
he
must
do
the
attacking
and
do
this
--
have
had
the
burden
proof,
isn't
that
a
pretty
big
change?
i
recall
the
many
cases
where
i
think
probably,
judges
have
convicted
people
because
they
didn't
believe
they
were
guilty
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
here,
there's
a
good
deal
of
who
has
the
burden
of
proof,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
bound
to
have
a
practical
effect
on
the
result,
isn't
it?
