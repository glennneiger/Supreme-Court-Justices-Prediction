mr.
sherman
s.
poland
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
for
25
years,
section
1
(b)
of
natural
gas
act
has
been
interpreted
by
the
commission
and
by
the
courts
including
this
court
as
permitting
parties
to
enter
into
transactions
treating
their
gas
as
a
fungible
commodity.
now,
according
to
the
commission,
this
is
no
longer
possible.
and
if
lo-vaca
or
houston
enter
into
a
contract
with
el
paso
for
el
paso's
own
use
in
his
compressor
stations
or
for
el
paso's
or
for
use
in
intrastate
commerce,
that
sale
in
itself
is
defeated
if
el
paso
commingles
the
gas
received
from
lo-vaca
and
houston
with
other
gas
which
is
bought
for
resale.
the
question
then
it
seems
is,
does
section
1
(b)
deny
the
fungibility
of
natural
gas
or
more
fundamental
–
mentally?
does
it
deny
the
power
of
parties
in
the
first
instance
to
set
their
relationships
by
contract
whether
it'd
be
a
restricted
use
sale
or
whether
it'd
be
in
a
bailment
in
the
transportation
or
a
bailment
in
the
storage
project
where
there
is
joint
storage.
the
cases
which
have
interpreted
the
commission's
power
under
section
7
--
under
section
1
(b)
have
uniformly
held
that
the
parties
themselves
established
that
relationship.
and
they
established
it
using
the
standard
commercial
concept
that
gas
is
a
fungible
commodity.
and
when
gas
is
a
fungible
commodity,
they
may
and
do
sell
by
volume.
for
a
--
a
seller
of
gas
is
like
a
seller
of
grain.
when
a
farmer
puts
50,000
bushels
of
wheat
into
an
elevator
and
later
sells
that
wheat
to
the
mill,
he
doesn't
sell
the
same
grains
to
be
put
in,
he
sells
by
volume.
he
puts
in
50,000
bushels
and
he
takes
out
50,000
bushels.
in
the
grain
elevator
case,
perhaps
none
of
the
same
50,000
bushels
that
he
put
in
is
any
longer
in
the
elevator.
that
is
not
this
case
here,
however,
to
the
extent
that
the
gas
which
we
put
in
will
flow
continuously
downstream
to
the
points
of
use
but
we
sell
by
volume.
gas
like
grain,
or
oil,
or
coal
in
each
unit
is
indistinguishable
and
interchangeable,
so
that
the
mo
--
molecule
has
no
separate
and
independent
legal
significance
and
parties
sell
by
volume.
they
enter
into
and
make
their
contractual
commitment
by
volume.
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
in
the
absence
of
the
natural
gas
act,
the
parties
could
and
would
make
this
type
of
a
transaction,
it
would
be
a
restricted
use
transaction.
the
question
is,
does
the
section
1
(b)
of
the
natural
gas
act
which
describes
a
type
of
a
transaction
which
the
commission
has
jurisdiction
over
give
the
commission
power
to
determine
the
--
what
kind
of
transaction
parties
may
enter
into?
we
will
approach
this
problem
by
reference
to
the
several
cases
involving
your
section
1
(b)
of
the
natural
gas
act
or
301
(b)
--
301
(b)
of
the
power
act
which
is
in
this
respect
substantially
similar.
also
giving
reference
to
which
what
we
think
is
a
fundamental
law
back
of
the
basis
for
commission
regulation
which
is
recognized
in
these
cases.
we
shall
also
then
turn
to
the
question
of
whether
recognition
of
fungibility
opens
up
a
--
or
creates
a
regulatory
gap.
mr.
sherman
s.
poland
houston
pipeline,
your
honor,
has
contracts
with
its
producers,
one
of
which
is
in
the
record
in
this
case
for
reference,
which
provides
that
the
producer
must
be
given
notice
before
houston
ever
sells
any
gas
in
interstate
commerce.
houston
is
an
entirely
intrastate
commerce
now.
and
the
producers
may
--
may
cancel
their
contracts
prior
to
the
sale
by
houston
into
interstate
commerce.
so
that
if
houston
sale
were
in
interstate
commerce,
producers
upon
whom
houston
depends
not
only
for
this
sale
but
for
its
service
to
the
city
of
houston.
it
could
cancel
out
and
they
would
be
without
that
supply
of
gas.
so
they
must
and
this
is
the
reason
why
they
filed
a
petition
for
declaratory
order
and
the
basis
for
the
way
this
case
started.
they
filed
a
petition
for
declaratory
order
to
determine
what
the
jurisdiction
was
over
this
particular
sale.
mr.
sherman
s.
poland
with
respect
to
--
to
those
producers
i
think
it
must
be
the
--
the
one
portion
of
the
producer
contract
which
is
in
the
record
here
--
makes
it
explicit
that
they
don't
want
to
or
they
have
the
opportunity
to
pull
out
if
it's
going
to
go
in
interstate.
now
--
now,
this
is
not
so,
i
might
say,
in
--
on
the
other
--
other
side
with
respect
to
the
sale
to
lo-vaca.
the
producer
sales
to
lo-vaca
will
be
sales
to
lo-vaca
for
resale
to
el
paso
in
interstate
commerce.
the
producer
sales
to
lo-vaca
will
be
subject
to
the
commission
jurisdiction
and
the
commission
regulation
and
their
rates
will
be
subject
to
commission's
jurisdiction
and
regulation.
and
of
course,
el
pa
--
lo-vaca
has
entered
into
jurisdictional
contracts
and
a
“nonjurisdictional”
contract.
finally,
in
--
in
ending
our
--
our
argument
we
would
like
to
--
to
go
into
the
question
of
--
of
what
power
the
commission
does.
in
very
real
power,
the
commission
does
have
over
many
aspects
of
these
proposals.
it
is
not
a
question
of
regulation
or
no
regulation
as
we
should
show.
i
think
that
the
starting
point
for
discussion
of
the
--
the
fungibility
doctrine
is
the
case
of
united
states
versus
california
at
345
u.s.
which
was
discussed
earlier
this
morning.
in
that
proceeding,
the
california
electric
company
was
making
a
single
sale
of
electric
energy
to
the
navy,
to
the
navy
in
california,
which
the
navy
would
carry
across
the
state
line
into
nevada
and
devote
a
portion
--
a
large
portion
to
its
own
use
and
a
smaller
portion
for
resale.
california
--
the
state
of
california
and
the
california
company
argued
that
at
least
that
portion
of
the
energy,
which
was
used
by
the
navy
for
its
own
use
in
another
state
similar
to
the
type
of
a
transaction
of
lo-vaca
in
--
in
the
sense
that
it
was
a
sale
in
one
state
for
use
in
another
state.
california
argued
that
that
portion
of
the
sale
was
subject
to
its
jurisdiction
because
it
was
not
a
jurisdictional
sale.
this
court
held
that
the
sale,
since
it
included
admittedly
energy
being
sold
for
resale,
was
subject
to
commission
re
--
federal
power
commission
regulation.
the
very
terms
which
would
control
the
sale
for
the
navy's
own
use
would
be
regulated
by
the
federal
power
commission
and
the
federal
power
commission's
regulation
as
a
necessary
incident
covered
the
sale
to
the
navy
for
its
own
use.
but
in
--
in
making
that
decision,
the
court
was
at
pains
to
point
out
that
if
the
parties
had
entered
into
a
separate
transaction
in
terms
of
separate
rates,
separate
negotiations,
separate
contracts,
separate
middling,
the
indicia
of
a
separate
transaction,
then
what
was
admittedly
“nonjurisdictional”
because
it
is
a
sale
for
resale
--
sale
for
the
purchaser's
own
consumption
would
not
be
subject
to
a
federal
power
commission
jurisdiction.
but
note,
it
did
not
say
that
that
sale
was
converted
necessarily
into
a
sale
for
resale
because
of
later
commingling.
commingling
in
none
of
the
cases
has
any
effect
upon
the
type
of
transaction,
which
is
entered
into
because
gas
or
electricity
is
a
fungible.
and
the
intermingling
makes
no
legal
difference
to
the
type
of
a
contract
and
it
is
the
--
it
is
the
sale
itself
as
the
court
said
in
the
california
case.
it
is
the
sale
itself,
which
fixes
the
limits
of
jurisdictional
grant
not
the
use
of
the
--
not
the
intermingling
of
the
gas
by
the
purchaser
but
the
sale
itself.
in
the
california
case,
the
court,
i
submit,
was
recognizing
what
this
court
had
also
recognized
in
the
well-known
case
of
united
gas
pipeline
corporation
versus
mobile
gas
service
corporation,
which
is
it
appears
that
332
u.s.
or
350
u.s.
332.
in
that
proceeding,
the
court
will
recall
the
question
involved
whether
the
commission
had
jurisdiction
to
entertain
a
unilateral
rate
increase
filing
of
a
sale
which
is
admittedly
subject
to
commission's
jurisdiction.
and
the
court
said
in
reversing
the
commission,
said
that
that
--
the
commission
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
consider
unilateral
filing
because
there
was
no
contract
between
the
parties.
and
it
started
from
the
fundamental
basis
that
it
is
the
parties
themselves
that
fix
the
relationships
between
themselves
by
contract.
and
when
they
have
fix
that
relationship,
it
is
then
brought
to
the
commission,
and
if
--
if
it
is
a
jurisdictional
relationship,
the
commission
may
review
it.
the
commission
may
review
it
under
section
4
or
5
or
may
review
it
under
section
7.
but
if
it
is
not
a
jurisdictional
relationship,
the
commission
cannot
because
of
its
jurisdiction
over
sales
for
resale
convert
what
the
parties
have
made
to
be
a
sale
for
purchaser's
own
use
into
a
sale
for
resale,
contrary
to
the
standard
commercial
concept
fungible
--
dealing
with
fungible
commodities.
the
court
in
california
recognized
that
this
case
with
the
same
theory
was
coming
again
before
the
commission,
was
then
before
the
commission
in
case
which
became
the
hastings
case.
in
the
hastings
case,
the
seller
sold
gas
at
the
city
gate
in
the
interstate
commerce
under
two
contracts,
a
portion
that
the
--
or
sold
under
one
contract
was
for
the
city's
own
use
for
boiler
fuel
since
it
was
the
sale
in
the
interstate
commerce
to
the
purchaser's
own
consumption.
it
was
not
jurisdictional.
the
other
sale
for
resale,
general
resale,
was
jurisdictional.
but
note
that
the
city
commingled
the
volumes
so
that
the
molecules
themselves
were
just
as
much
lost
in
that
case
as
in
the
lo-vaca's
case.
a
molecule
of
gas
sold
under
the
sale
to
the
city
for
its
own
use
might
well
end
up
and
because
of
commingling,
it
did
end
up
being
reso
--
going
to
the
point
of
resale.
and
a
molecule
sold
under
the
resale
contract
would
end
up
at
the
point
of
the
boiler
fuel
plant.
but
because
gas
is
a
fungible
commodity,
they
sold
by
volume.
they
didn't
sell
the
individual
the
--
the
fact
that
they
sold
gas
did
not
mean
that
there
was
any
legal
significance
to
the
separate
identity
of
indistinguishable
molecules
of
gas.
so
too
in
north
dakota
which
i
would
like
to
point
out
involved
not
just
one
source
of
gas
but
involved
two
sellers
under
four
contracts.
each
seller
had
interstate
resale
contracts
and
each
seller
had
intrastate
resale
contracts.
and
by
far,
the
smaller
amount
was
being
sold
for
resale
in
intrastate
commerce.
the
figures
have
stick
in
my
mind
where
about
six-and-a-half
million
mcf
delivered
from
the
plant
under
all
of
the
contracts
and
about
11,000
delivered
under
two
contracts
for
resale
within
the
state.
the
point
is
that
15%
of
the
11,000
was
attributed
to
signal
but
you
could
not
go
back
and
trace
that
15%
to
signal.
it
may
very
well
and
probably
did
come
from
amerada
and
may
very
well
and
probably
did
by
mol
--
molecules
coming
from
amerada's
sale
for
general
use
in
montana.
so
that
what
those
cases
hold
is
that
commingling
makes
no
difference.
that
the
--
you
do
not
trace
molecules
for
this
purpose.
it's
a
sale
of
volumes.
now,
the
north
dakota
case
has
an
interesting
sequel
recently
decided
by
the
same
court
with
the
same
parties,
same
buyer,
and
same
sellers.
where
all
the
sellers
intended
to
do
was
to
add
more
gas
to
go
to
the
north
dakota
intrastate
use.
you
would
think
that
the
same
theory
would
apply,
that
commingling
would
make
no
difference.
the
commission,
however,
held
on
another
show
cost
that
those
sales
which
had
been
sales
in
intrastate
commerce
were
converted
into
sales
in
interstate
commerce
not
for
anything
that
the
parties
themselves
did
in
fixing
the
relationship
between
them,
but
because
of
the
presence
of
gas
put
into
the
commingled
stream
from
a
third
source.
we
submit
that
the
fact
of
a
third
source
obviously
can
have
no
difference
as
the
court
in
the
eight
circuit
held
in
reversing
the
commission
for
it
is
not
the
tracing
of
the
molecules.
in
--
in
the
original
north
dakota
case
and
in
the
amerada
case,
the
molecules
sold
by
amerada
or
sold
by
signal
for
use
within
the
state
at
the
point
of
sale
might
very
well
go
to
montana
and
be
resold
to
the
same
extend
that
a
molecule
sold
by
houston
to
el
paso.
because
of
commingling,
it
might
reach
a
point
of
resale.
but
the
parties
entered
into
a
type
of
--
of
contractual
arrangement
which
the
commission
then
looked
at
-
and
if
that
arrangement
described
a
sale
for
resale,
it
had
jurisdiction,
if
it
does
not
under
section
1
(b),
it
does
not
have
jurisdiction.
perhaps
the
major
fallacy
of
the
commission's
new
position
here
is
--
is
most
graphically
demonstrated
in
the
transportation
cases.
it
is
correct
that
the
commission
here
held
in
its
opinion
in
this
case
that
it
did
not
intend
to
disturb
transportation
arrangements.
we
submit
that
if
it
does
not
intend
to
disturb
transportation
arrangements
when
it
admits
that
a
producer
selling
say
in
--
let's
use
the
case
of
federal
power
commission
versus
transcontinental
which
is
set
in
our
brief,
it
was
a
supreme
court
case
a
couple
of
years
ago,
as
an
example.
their
producers
sold
to
consolidated
edison
of
new
york.
consolidated
edison
delivered
the
gas
to
transcontinental
for
transportation
to
new
york
city.
transcontinental
commingled
that
gas
with
other
gas
purchased
from
many
other
sources.
so
that
the
molecule
delivered
by
con-ed
would
might
very
well
reach
a
point
of
resold
to
be
replaced
by
an
identical
molecule
for
kind
of
its
own
use.
the
commission
in
its
opinion
here
said
it
does
not
intend
to
disturb
that
relationship.
if
it
does
not
intend
to
disturb
that
relationship,
it
is
clear
that
it
is
because
fungibility
is
a
living
and
vital
force
which
af
--
is
determines
the
type
of
transaction
they
enter
into.
if
it
is
not,
they
haven't
entered
into
that
type
of
a
transaction.
to
the
same
extent,
if
fungibility
determines
the
type
of
transaction
the
parties
have
entered
into,
the
parties
here
have
entered
into
sales
for
el
paso's
own
use
or
sales
in
intrastate
commerce.
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
that.
on
the
other
hand,
if
as
suggested
by
counsel,
in
--
the
commission
counsel
in
its
brief,
fungibility
is
to
be
denied,
then
the
delivery
of
the
--
for
transportation
purposes
is
converted
according
to
the
theory
into
really
three
sales,
into
a
sale
by
the
producer
to
con-ed
for
resale,
into
a
sale
by
con-ed
to
transcontinental
for
resale,
and
a
sale
by
transcontinental
to
con-ed.
this
court
recognized
in
the
transcontinental
case
when
it
discussed
the
commission's
certificate
power
over
transportation.
it
recognized
that
the
producer's
sale
was
“nonjurisdictional”
because
it
was
a
sale
to
con-ed
for
its
own
use.
but
the
commission's
theory
would
convert
that
bailment
type
of
a
transaction
into
several
different
sales.
it
is
our
position
that
section
1
(b)
does
not
give
the
commission
authority
to
convert
what
the
parties
established
in
the
first
instance
into
a
different
type
of
transaction.
i'm
filing
a
brief
before
the
commission
tomorrow
in
another
proceeding
involving
storage
of
natural
gas
where
two
companies
store
gas
together.
and
one
access
operator
from
the
other,
one
being
a
completely
intrastate
company
putting
its
gas
in
retaining
title,
pulling
it
out,
the
other
being
an
interstate
company.
the
commission
stopped
based
upon
the
commission's
opinion
here
in
lo-vaca
is
saying
that
that
is
not
a
bailment,
it
is
a
sale
for
resale
when
the
intrastate
company
puts
it
gas
into
the
storage
field
and
commingles.
section
1
(b)
simply
does
not
give
the
commission
the
authority
to
determine
the
type
of
transaction,
the
type
of
transaction
determines
jurisdiction.
i
would
like
to
turn
next
to
the
argument
on
regulatory
gap
on
whether
recognition
of
fungibility
just
i
submit
recognized
in
all
of
the
cases
we
have
discussed
and
i
have
discussed
it
so
far,
whether
that
creates
a
regulatory
gap.
first,
i
think
it
would
be
wise
to
go
back
and
determine
what
is
the
so-called
regulatory
gap
that
the
natural
gas
act
was
intended
to
fill.
the
natural
gas
act,
passed
in
1938,
was
intended
to
cover
only
one
type
of
transaction
in
interstate
commerce,
which
was
beyond
the
power
of
the
states
to
regulate.
and
that
type
of
transaction
as
determined
by
the
decisions
at
that
time.
it
was
at
that
time
a
drawing
of
what
had
been
considered
national
and
local
interest.
and
the
act
itself
now
draws
the
distinction
between
national
and
local
interest
giving
the
commission
authority
over
sales
in
interstate
commerce
for
resale
but
no
other
type
of
sale.
it
seems
that
this
was
clearly
defined
in
--
in
the
panhandle
versus
indiana
case
in
332
u.s.
and
again
discussed
just
last
term
in
federal
power
commission
versus
southern
california
edison
case,
where
a
contention
was
made
by
california.
as
i
understand
their
contention
here
in
somewhat
adverse
form
that
in
that
case,
in
the
california
edison
case,
contention
was
made
that
even
though
it
was
a
sale
for
resale
in
the
interstate
commerce,
it
was
a
local
character
and
therefore
beyond
the
federal
power
commission
jurisdiction.
this
court
disagreed
and
said
that
the
act
had
drawn
a
bright
line.
sales
for
resale
are
subject
to
commission
jurisdiction,
any
other
type
of
sale
for
whatever
purpose
are
not
subject
to
commission
jurisdiction.
so
too
here,
if
this
is
not
a
sale
for
resale
if
the
parties
have
not
entered
into
a
sale
for
resale,
there
is
no
regulatory
gap
by
reason
of
the
fact
they've
entered
into
a
sale
for
the
purchaser's
own
consumption
in
the
interstate
commerce.
the
act
was
intended
that
such
sales
would
not
be
subject
to
federal
power
commission
of
jurisdiction,
neither
does
the
act
give
the
commission
jurisdiction
based
upon
effect
of
interstate
commerce.
the
fact
that
a
4%
of
a
particular
pipeline
or
overall
the
pipelines
may
be
used
for
“nonjurisdictional”
purpose
does
not
mean
that
those
sales
are
converted
into
sales
for
resale
in
interstate
commerce,
and
that
is
the
only
test.
the
affect
can
be
seen,
it
seems
to
me,
just
as
clearly
by
the
suggestion
that
if
parties
constructed
their
own
separate
line
to
these
points
of
views,
the
sales
to
el
paso
would
not
be
subject
as
counsel
have
admitted
to
commission
jurisdiction
for
there
would
not
be
sales
in
the
interstate
commerce
for
resale,
yet
they
would
affect
el
paso
just
as
much.
if
lo-vaca
or
houston
were
to
sale
oil
for
this
compressor
fuel,
it
would
affect
el
paso
just
as
much.
but
the
commission
would
not
have
jurisdiction
over
that
sale.
the
commission
simply
does
not
have
jurisdiction
because
of
what
it
feels
may
be
the
affect.
but
we
do
not
wish
to
leave
this
with
the
court
with
the
feeling
that
these
transactions
in
their
entirety
are
without
regulation.
for
quite
the
contrary
is
true
and
the
commission
has
full
power
given
to
it
under
the
act
to
control
these
transactions
in
the
public
interest.
let's
look
first
at
lo-vaca.
lo-vaca
buys
gas
from
producers.
those
producer
sales
are
18
cents.
18
cents
happen
to
be
the
price
the
comm
--
at
that
time
the
commission
had
stated
in
its
guideline
policy
statement
that
it
would
accept
producers
sales
in
that
area
and
issue
certificates
without
hearing
so
long
as
there
was
no
intervention
so
that
those
prices
were
the
guideline
price
at
the
time.
in
any
event,
regardless
of
whether
the
commission
changed
its
view
and
might
come
to
a
lower
rate
now,
those
rates
would
be
subject
to
the
commission's
jurisdiction.
and
the
commission
would
regulate
those
rates.
lo-vaca,
lo-vaca
has
here
its
application
for
a
certificate.
not
for
the
sale
where
it
is
making
what
is
essentially
a
direct
industrial
sale
in
the
interstate
commerce,
but
for
the
transportation
and
for
the
construction
facilities
for
that
transportation,
it
applies
for
a
certificate.
it
will
in
that
proceeding,
present
a
feasibility
study
justifying
its
proposal.
lo-vaca
also
is
making
a
sale
for
resale
and
will
operate
some
of
the
same
facilities
in
connection
with
the
sale
for
resale.
and
its
certificate
application
covers
that.
el
paso,
if
the
commission
has
a
problem
with
el
paso
coming
to
the
south
texas
to
pickup
this
gas
through
the
construction
of
this
line,
that
line
by
el
paso
gas
supply,
and
actually
the
el
paso
running
from
sonora
to
three
rivers,
must
be
certificated.
the
commission's
consideration
in
certificating
that
line
is
much
like
the
commission's
consideration
in
the
transcontinental
case
which
came
before
this
court,
where
the
commission
and
the
court
were
concerned
with
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
for
transportation
in
interstate
commerce.
and
the
court
held
that
in
it's
public
convenience
and
necessity
determination,
the
commission
could
consider
what
the
gas
was
going
to
be
used
for,
and
it
also
consider
at
the
other
end
the
price
of
the
gas,
and
its
consideration
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
so
to
here,
when
el
paso
comes
before
the
commission
for
it's
certificate
for
that
line,
the
commission
can
consider
whether
these
prices
are
high
or
low
or
whether
el
paso
should
buy
this
gas
for
compressor
fuel
or
whether
it
has
a
presumably
some
other
source
and
whether
it
has
too
much
gas
on
its
system.
those
things
are
matters
which
the
commission
has
full
power
over.
i
would
like
to
point
out
further
that
the
commission
suggests
that
there
were
several
dire
results
which
might
come
to
pass
if
this
kind
of
a
transaction
is
permitted.
the
commission
has
permitted
this
type
of
transaction
for
25
years.
and
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
determine,
these
dire
results
would
not
come
to
pass.
i
submit
that
they
have
not
come
to
pass
because
the
commission
does
have
full
power
in
its
certificate
proceedings
to
control
any
unwanted
result.
furthermore,
it
has
power
in
rate
proceedings
to
regulate
el
paso's
rates
in
such
a
way
that
for
instance
it
could
roll
in
average
as
it
does.
all
of
el
paso's
purchased
gas
costs
both
gas
be
resold
and
gas
which
is
not
resold
and
get
a
unit
cost
so
that
there
is
no
question
of
preferment
insofar
as
the
resale
costumers
are
concerned.
finally,
i
think
it
is
significant
really
that
what
the
commission
is
doing
is
seeking
to
increase
its
jurisdiction.
this
is
not
a
chipping
away
from
jurisdiction.
this
is
an
increase
of
jurisdiction.
what
the
commission
is
saying
is
that
any
delivery
by
anyone
either
by
--
for
any
type
of
the
sale
is
a
--
into
a
commingle
stream
where
a
portion
of
that
commingle
stream
is
being
sold
for
resale,
is
converted
itself
into
a
sale
for
resale.
perhaps
the
--
the
extent
of
the
expansion
of
commission's
jurisdiction
can
be
illustrated
by
reference
to
the
sale
by
el
paso
to
the
companies
at
the
california
border.
el
paso
sells
a
large
amount
of
gas
at
the
california
border
for
resale.
for
every
single
mcf
of
gas
that
is
sold
by
el
paso
to
the
companies
at
california
border,
there
is
if
you
affirm
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
a
producer
sale
to
el
paso
which
is
a
sale
for
resale
in
interstate
commerce
which
the
commission
regulates.
there
is
a
direct
coincidence
for
every
mcf
of
gas
sold
for
resale
at
the
california
border.
there
would
be
sale
for
resale
over
which
the
commission
has
jurisdiction.
however,
if
the
commission's
view
holds
here
there
will
be
more
gas
sold
to
el
paso
for
resale
subject
to
the
commission's
jurisdiction
than
there
is
in
fact
resold,
we
submit
that
the
parties
have
entered
into
sales,
effective
sales,
to
el
paso
either
for
its
own
use
or
in
intrastate
commerce.
having
done
so,
the
description
of
the
type
of
sale
in
section
1
(b),
which
is
subject
to
commission's
jurisdiction,
does
not
apply.
on
the
other
hand,
these
sales
come
within
the
other
clause
of
section
1
(b)
which
says
that
the
commission
shall
not
have
a
jurisdiction
over
any
other
type
of
sale
in
which
this
court
in
the
panhandle
case
has
said
of
any
other
type
of
sale
of
whatever
sort.
thank
you.
mr.
sherman
s.
poland
may
--
may
it
please
the
court.
it
would
be
out
of
order
to
me
to
say
that
i
--
i
just
don't
want
it
to
be
interpreted
as
i
might
have
said
something
which
was
just
not
true
when
trying
to
mislead
the
court
because
i
certainly
did
not
mean
that.
what
i
was
saying
was
that,
these
sales
in
the
hastings
case
and
the
sale
in
the
north
dakota
case
which
the
commission
approved
and
fought
in
the
courts
saying
that
they
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over,
are
identical
in
concept
with
these
here.
thank
you.
