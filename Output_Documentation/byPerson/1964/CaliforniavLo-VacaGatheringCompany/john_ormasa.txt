mr.
john
ormasa
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
the
southern
california
gas
company
and
the
southern
counties
gas
company
of
california
are
gas
public
utility
distributing
companies
in
central
and
southern
california
serving
approximately
9
to
10
million
people.
we
purchase
some
75%
to
80%
of
our
gas
supply
from
out
of
state.
we
received
that
at
the
california
border
principally
from
el
paso
natural
gas
company.
we
are
taking
at
the
border
daily
from
el
paso
approximately
1,300,000,000
cubic
feet
of
gas
per
day
which
is
the
substantial
flow
of
gas.
our
neighbor
utility
to
the
north,
the
pacific
gas
and
electric
company
also
a
california
public
utility
pays
approximately
the
same
amount.
the
fact
is
that
80%
of
el
paso's
gas
is
sold
to
the
california
market.
that
90%
of
its
jurisdictional
gas
is
sold
in
the
california
market.
section
1
(b)
here
in
question,
provides
when
you
have
a
sale
or
resale
interstate
commerce,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission
shall
attach,
and
it
does.
in
the
deep
south
case,
the
fifth
circuit
pointed
out
that
as
a
practical
matter
and
that
this
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
congress
when
they
had
it
in
mind
in
section
1
(b)
that
the
price
which
a
public
utility
distributing
company
can
charge
his
costumers.
or
the
low-price,
he
can
charge
these
customers
are
dependent
in
large
part
in
turn
upon
what
it
must
pay
the
interstate
pipeline
company
providing
its
gas
supply.
the
price
we
pay
for
gas
at
the
border
is
set
by
the
federal
power
commission.
why?
because
as
in
section
1
(b)
and
as
this
court
said
in
that
fpc
v.
natural
gas
pipeline
company,
when
you
sell
gas
in
one
state
and
transport
it
and
deliver
it
to
a
distributing
company
in
another
state,
that
is
interstate
commerce
or
resale.
the
fact
is
here
that
the
houston
lo-vaca
gas
would
be
the
gas
sold
in
the
state
of
texas
and
would
in
substantial
part
be
transported
and
delivered
to
the
state
of
california.
this
has
been
conceded
throughout
this
proceeding.
the
parties
so
testified.
the
president
of
houston
pipeline
company
acknowledged
it.
the
chief
pipeline
engineer
of
el
paso
acknowledged
it.
no
one
said
otherwise.
the
examiners
so
found,
the
federal
power
commission
so
found,
the
majority
opinion
in
the
fifth
circuit
so
found.
in
fact,
the
gas
flows
to
california.
why
then
can
we
device
some
way
of
avoiding
that
jurisdiction?
what
justifies
it?
we
are
asked
to
engage
in
false
idolatry.
i
used
that
term
with
some
care
having
sat
through
the
sections
here
the
past
couple
of
days
on
what
is
this,
not
in
relation
to
what
have
you.
but
here,
all
the
parties
acknowledged
that
this
is
false
idolatry.
they
say
let's
pretend,
however,
that
the
gas
is
used
where
the
sale
would
be
used.
let's
pretend
the
gas
will
be
used
in
texas
on
the
houston
gas,
and
let's
ignore
reality.
now,
i
like
you
to
turn,
if
you
would,
to
record
page
115
which
is
a
map
that
mr.
solomon
turned
your
attention
to
yesterday.
it's
exhibit
6
in
the
proceeding.
it
describes
the
flow
of
gas.
perhaps
while
you
are
doing
that,
i
might
deal
more
generally
with
what
i
see
the
concepts
been
here.
mr.
john
ormasa
115
of
the
record
your
honor.
there's
a
map
there.
there
should
be.
mr.
john
ormasa
let
me
deal
with
the
concept
before
we
get
to
the
actual
facts
of
this
case.
the
section
1
(b)
has
two
requirements
in
order
to
have
a
sale
for
resale
interstate
commerce.
number
one,
you
must
have
the
actual
sale
itself.
number
two,
you
must
have
a
natural
gas
company.
the
natural
gas
company
is
defined
as
the
person
making
the
sale
for
resale
in
interstate
commerce.
i
think
it's
important
to
bear
those
two
things
in
mind.
now,
there's
been
much
talk
of
commi
--
commingling.
now,
what
does
commingling
mean?
how
does
it
affect
this
case?
and
i
think
that
we
have
failed
to
express
properly
what
we
mean
by
commingling
and
how
it
affects
this
case.
i
think
we
feel
on
the
fifth
circuit.
i
hope
we
don't
make
that
mistake
here.
let
me
give
you
this
example.
part
of
the
gas
of
houston
pipeline
company
theoretically
is
to
be
sold
to
the
phillips
goldsmith
plant
in
the
state
of
texas.
now,
let's
change
the
facts
of
this
case.
let's
assume
that
that
part
is
still
true,
but
that
you
have
an
interstate
pipeline
company
into
texas.
it
stops
there.
it
does
not
go
beyond
texas.
let's
speed
into
that
line.
commingle
if
you
will.
there's
houston
pipeline
company
gas.
let's
do
it
before
it
can
get
to
that
phillips
goldsmith
plant.
now,
is
that
houston
pipeline
gas,
gas
flowed
in
the
interstate
commerce
for
resale
because
of
the
commingling?
obviously
not,
the
gas
never
left
the
state.
it
couldn't
possibly
leave
the
state.
there's
no
possible
basis
for
fpc
jurisdiction.
so
if
it's
not
commingling
that
really
we're
talking
about,
we're
talking
about
the
flow
of
the
gas
to
california
for
resale
as
part
of
a
commingled
supply.
that's
which
is
the
federal
power
commission
jurisdiction.
now,
let
me
give
you
another
simple
example
on
the
other
side
of
the
case
perhaps.
let's
start
out
with
el
paso
and
let's
assume
that
if
three
rivers,
texas
where
this
new
line
is
to
start.
you
--
you
have
el
paso
natural
gas
company
and
let's
assume
that
all
its
gas
is
going
to
flow
in
interstate
commerce
for
resale.
let's
assume
that
lo-vaca
now
provides
a
certain
portion
of
gas
and
that
theoretically,
this
is
to
be
sold
let's
say
to
a
--
or
a
cement
plant
in
the
state
of
arizona.
i
submit
to
you
that
that
gas
from
lo-vaca
just
as
much
as
the
el
paso
gas
flows
to
california
for
resale
in
substantial
part.
and
that
accordingly
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
power
commission
must
impose
a
tax
so
long
as
it
flows
in
that
interstate
pipeline.
now,
you
reached
a
point
when
that
jurisdiction
ceases.
and
where
is
that
point?
that
point
is
when
you
had
your
lateral
going
off
the
interstate
pipeline
to
the
cement
plant.
this
is
the
panhandle
eastern
case
in
372
u.s.
305.
remember
that
in
that
case
the
question
was,
“does
the
state
of
indiana
have
jurisdiction
over
this
industrial
sale?”
this
court
held
that
it
did.
that
despite
the
fact
that
the
federal
power
commission
had
certified
the
facilities
and
they
pointed
that
there
is
cooperation
if
you
will
between
the
state
and
federal
jurisdiction
that
this
is
your
comprehensive
regulation.
it
pointed
out
that
on
the
very
fpc
certificate
that
the
fpc
has
referred
to
the
indiana
statute
and
said
nothing.
it
was
doing,
it
was
meant
to
interfere
with
the
jurisdiction
of
indiana
over
the
industrial
sale.
now
let
me
apply
these
concepts,
if
i
will,
to
this
record
i've
asked
you
to
turn
to.
you
will
note
that
this
new
pipeline
of
227
miles
from
sonora
south
to
three
rivers
is
to
obtain
access
to
south
texas
supply
as
mr.
solomon
told
you
about
it.
let's
just
look
at
ban
over
that
pipeline.
that's
a
30-inch
pipeline.
it's
bigger
on
the
existing
pipeline
of
el
paso
stopping
at
sonora
which
is
the
most
southern
part
of
the
el
paso
system
which
is
a
20-inch
line.
now,
that
227-mile
line,
30
inches
diameter
which
can
take
what,
500,
600
million
cubic
feet
a
gas
per
day.
that's
not
going
down
there
to
bring
fuel
to
el
paso
plant
all
through
texas
hundreds
of
miles
apart
and
then
lead
to
arizona
and
new
mexico.
that's
going
down
there
to
get
new
sources
of
supply.
there
has
been
no
question
about
that
in
this
proceeding.
let's
bear
this
in
mind.
lo-vaca
has
two
separate
contracts,
one
which
is
so-called
jurisdictional
now
which
is
conceded
the
federal
power
has
jurisdiction.
the
other
which
they
say
that
no
jurisdiction
because
of
this
clause
that
is
going
to
be
use
in
arizona
and
new
mexico,
this
impossible
clause.
that
gas
will
commingle
before
it
ever
reaches
that
new
pipeline.
even
lo-vaca's
jurisdictional
and
“nonjurisdictional
class”
will
commingle
before
it
reaches
the
pipeline.
there
it
will
commingle
in
turn
with
the
houston
gas
which
is
theoretically
“nonjurisdictional”.
all
along
the
line,
gas
will
flow
in.
you
can
never
segregate
that
out
and
that's
why
the
gas
ultimately
reaches
california.
that's
why
houston
lo-vaca
gas
gets
there.
to
maintain
this
theory
that
the
gas
physically
could
reach
compressor
plants,
you
might
take
a
look
up
there
from
the
northeastern
part
of
the
map,
you
can
see
a
place
called
fullerton
--
mr.
john
ormasa
fullerton,
f-u-l-l-e-r-t-o-n
station,
south
of
watson.
you
see
benedum
junction.
there's
a
line
going
up
to
the
right.
you'll
note
on
the
map
that
at
benedum
junction
which
appears
just
below
magnolia,
follow
up
the
line
up
to
magnolia
through
phillips
goldsmith
and
you
see
a
green
line
of
the
name
fullerton
there,
right
on
the
line.
mr.
john
ormasa
now,
what
is
going
to
be
done
at
fullerton,
you
know
what's
going
to
be
done
at
fullerton?
we're
going
to
build
a
pipeline
into
the
fullerton
plant.
does
the
fullerton
plant
need
that
gas?
not
only
does
it
need
it,
fullerton
provides
its
own
gas
supply.
in
addition,
you
notice
there's
a
16-inch
line
going
directly
west
from
fullerton,
it
supplies
gas
itself
to
the
general
el
paso
system.
it
doesn't
need
any
gas
for
compressor
use
at
all.
this
is
true
of
many
of
these
facilities,
which
are
sought
to
be
built.
you
see
the
line
that
mr.
tuttle
referred
to
at
keystone
ml.
it
may
be
difficult
to
find.
it's
just
where
everything
seems
to
come
together
there
we
have
those
pipelines
in
new
mexico.
at
the
present
time,
there's
no
way
at
all
that
any
gas
of
houston
lo-vaca
can
get
to
these
compressor
stations
in
west
texas
without
going
into
new
mexico
commingling
with
new
mexico
gas
then
coming
back
into
the
state
of
texas,
no
way
at
all.
so
they
say,
“alright,
in
order
to
help
this
fiction
out
we'll
build
a
pipeline,
a
210-mile
pipeline.”
so
that
theoretically
part
of
the
houston
lo-vaca
gas
would
then
go
through
that
16-inch
pipeline
and
serve
the
compressor
plants
there.
well,
in
truth
and
in
fact,
it
does
not
happen.
the
testimony
in
these
case
is,
that
part
of
the
houston
lo-vaca
gas
will
flow
through
that
pipeline,
that
part
of
that
houston
lo-vaca
gas
is
going
to
flow
up
through
fullerton
station
which
we
were
talking
about
over
to
unison
new
mexico
and
then
down
from
unison
new
mexico
back
to
pickles
river
station
back
into
texas.
the
testimony
is
that
part
of
the
houston
lo-vaca
gas
is
going
to
go
through
those
pipelines
just
west
of
keystone
station
into
the
state
of
new
mexico
then
going
back
into
texas.
this
is
all
fiction.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
case,
if
the
court
please,
that
demands
that
we
permit
a
contractual
segregation
which
is
meaningless,
which
we
end
up
with
the
result
where
we
don't
have
the
comprehensive
regulation
that
this
court
has
recently
as
transco
said
we
ought
to
have.
i'd
like
to
leave
a
little
time
for
rebuttal
for
mr.
solomon,
if
i
may.
thank
you
very
much
justices
of
the
court.
