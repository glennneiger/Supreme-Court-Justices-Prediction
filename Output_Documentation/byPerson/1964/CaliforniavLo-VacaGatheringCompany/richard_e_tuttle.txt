mr.
richard
e.
tuttle
mr.
chief
justice,
speaking
for
the
state
of
california,
i
would
like
to
talk
to
the
court
about
those
aspects
of
this
case
which
are
particularly
concerned
to
the
california
consumer
and
which
are
the
reason
for
my
presence
here.
mr.
solomon
has
explained
the
case
broadly
and
discussed
the
authorities
which
are
relied
on
by
respondents.
we're
concurring
his
presentation.
we
feel
that
the
respondents
here
seek
to
take
the
undisputed
physical
facts
and
turn
them
upside
down
by
means
of
a
legal
fiction
of
contractual
segregation.
all
of
the
parties
here
agree
that
the
gas
that
we're
talking
about,
the
gas
to
be
sold
to
el
paso,
is
the
same
gas
at
least
in
very
large
part
which
is
later
to
be
resold
in
california.
this
physical
fact
is
not
contested
and
because
of
these
admitted
facts,
each
of
the
sales
thus
fall
literally
within
the
terms
of
a
natural
gas
act
as
a
sale
in
the
words
of
the
act
in
interstate
commerce
of
natural
gas
for
resale.
mr.
richard
e.
tuttle
yes,
there
are
degrees
with
this
the
court
--
mr.
richard
e.
tuttle
there
are
--
mr.
richard
e.
tuttle
yes,
your
honor.
it
perhaps
making
the
point
if
you
can
take
molecular
identification
and
put
it
to
an
extent
that
if
literally
applied
might
have
some
effect
on
existing
practices.
with
this,
i
concur
and
i
think
that
my
position
on
this
would
come
out
as
i
proceed
with
my
discussion
on
this.
i
do
say
that
the
sales
are
within
the
literal
language
of
the
act
and
the
question
is
whether
there
is
any
reason
under
the
facts
presented
here.
the
court
showed
as
a
matter
of
policy
seeks
to
insulate
these
transactions
from
federal
control.
we
feel
that
the
gap
that
would
be
created
in
this
situation
by
giving
effect
to
this
contractual
segregation
was
a
serious
one
and
it's
--
it's
a
special
interest
to
california
because
we
consume
nearly
80%
of
el
paso's
gas.
and
if
the
device
tested
here
proves
successful,
some
7%
or
8%
of
the
gas
purchased
under
fpc
controlled
prices
by
el
paso
could
escape
that
control.
the
gas
would
become
more
costly.
this
additional
cost
within
large
part
be
ultimately
carried
by
the
california
consumer,
and
with
the
elimination
of
fpc
control
over
these
price
of
these
contractually
segregated
sales,
and
with
no
control
possible
by
the
california
commission
over
these
sales,
what
protection
is
left
for
the
consumer.
it's
not
fair
and
it's
not
reasonable
to
expect
that
texas,
even
if
it
could
legally
act,
would
regulate
these
prices
so
as
to
reduce
texas
income
and
provide
california
consumers
with
a
saving
of
the
expense
of
texas.
the
natural
gas
act
is
designed
to
provide
some
comprehensive
and
effective
regulation.
it
doesn't
contemplate
ineffective
regulation
or
a
gap
on
either
the
state
or
the
federal
level.
we
suggest
that
this
is
not
the
place
to
apply
a
legal
fiction
and
depart
from
an
interpretation
of
the
act
according
to
its
terms.
as
a
matter
of
physical
fact,
the
sales
do
fall
within
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
richard
e.
tuttle
the
sales
that
--
we
are
talking
about
the
sales
of
lo-vaca
and
houston.
in
texas,
no,
we
can't.
mr.
richard
e.
tuttle
not
over
those
sales,
no
your
honor.
in
light
of
the
background
that
i've
given,
it
would
appear
that
only
the
most
extra
ordinary
and
compelling
extrinsic
policy
considerations
would
just
apply
a
plain,
a
legal
fiction,
so
as
to
reach
a
result
that's
contrary
both
to
the
literal
language
and
we
believe
to
the
policy
of
the
natural
gas
act.
are
there
any
such
unique
and
extraordinary
reasons
here
such
overwriting
policy
considerations
which
would
lead,
tend
to
support
respondents
position?
we
can
look
at
some
of
the
readings,
it
would
have
been
suggested.
the
respondents
placed
great
weight
in
their
written
statements
of
intent
--
of
intention.
these
solemn
and
ritualistic
recitals
careful
and
precise
recitals
of
intent
to
perform
an
act
that
admittedly
can't
be
physically
performed.
and
indeed,
this
was
one
of
the
things
urged
in
support
of
their
position
but
the
fact
the
act
is
physically
impossible.
the
recitals
then
are
simply
self-serving
declarations.
the
lower
court
suggested
another
point.
it
said
that
fictitious
segregation
might
be
required
in
order
to
avoid
construction
of
unnecessary
duplicate
pipelines,
lines
that
might
otherwise
be
constructed
so
that
houston
and
lo-vaca
could
directly
serve
the
source
where
the
gas
was
to
be
consumed.
this
seems
to
us
somewhat
unrealistic.
fpc
jurisdiction
may
appear
on
the
pleasant
but
the
economic
facts
of
business
lie
for
such
that
it
would
seem
federal
jurisdiction
would
be
preferable
to
the
construction
of
new
and
separate
pipelines
across
texas,
new
mexico
and
arizona
simply
to
provide
fuel
for
el
paso's
compressors
and
other
facilities.
we
feel
that
worry
about
that
kind
of
duplicate
construction
is
just
sheer
speculation
about
an
unlikely
alternative.
it's
not
sheer
speculation,
however,
to
be
concerned
about
unnecessary
construction
such
as
proposed
in
this
case.
in
order
to
make
the
ferry
hold
water,
it's
necessary
to
put
in
additional
valves,
construct
a
16-inch
pipelines
to
the
expense
of
millions
of
dollars
also
that
it
can
be
set
with
a
straight
phase
that
it's
theoretically
possible
for
one
molecule
of
houston
or
lo-vaca
gas
to
reach
the
place
where
it's
supposed
to
reach.
although
everyone
agree
that
only
a
tiny
portion
of
that
gas
would
ever
reach
the
destination
where
it's
supposed
to
be
consumed
under
the
recitals
in
the
contract.
another
point
has
been
mentioned
is
that,
i
don't
say
this
is
directly
urged
but
to
some
extent
it
is
in
the
case.
it
appears
that
the
gas
obtained
under
these
contracts
might
not
be
offered
for
sale
by
the
producers
or
the
gatherers
unless
the
transactions
are
insulated
from
fpc
jurisdiction.
one
might
argue
from
this
that
fpc
jurisdiction
should
be
curtailed
to
enable
el
paso
to
get
gas
that
otherwise
would
not
be
available.
we
feel
it
unnecessary
to
elaborate
on
the
objections
to
that
type
of
a
consideration.
it
might
be
helpful
in
understanding
el
paso's
motivations
but
this
could
hardly
serve
as
the
basis
for
a
judicial
decision
surrendering
federal
jurisdiction.
again,
the
commission's
factual
analysis
at
the
flow
of
gas
is
criticized
by
the
respondents.
the
respondents
describe
it
in
this
way
as
the
molecular
identification
theory.
and
actually
what
they're
talking
about
is
the
commission's
effort
to
find
out
what
gas
actually
flows
where.
and
it
said
that
this
concern
of
the
commission
where
the
actual
flow
of
gas,
now
i
used
the
words
from
respondent's
brief
runs
counter
to
the
whole
stream
of
law
governing
commercial
practices
involving
fungible
commodities.
there
are
other
general
allegations
in
respondent's
brief
with
respect
to
the
law
of
fungibles.
and
i
would
like
to
take
a
few
moments
just
to
discuss
in
general
about
that
law
and
see
its
application
if
any
to
the
facts
before
us.
the
term
fungible
is
used
by
respondents
as
though
it's
a
meaningful
and
significant
legal
description
that
would
be
helpful
in
this
case.
but
it
doesn't
appear
that
fungible
has
a
significant
legal
meaning
in
this
context.
the
law
of
fungibles
developed
largely
in
cases
of
which
the
grain
elevators
are
perhaps
the
typical
ones.
the
question
usually
comes
before
the
court
where
there's
been
an
unexpected
development,
a
disaster
of
some
sort
either
a
physical
disaster,
fire,
or
flood,
or
a
financial
disaster
wiping
out
the
grain
elevator
proprietor,
something
about
nature.
the
goods
--
something
has
happened
so
that
it's
necessary
to
determine
the
interest,
the
ownerships
of
different
people,
perhaps
a
buyer,
a
seller,
a
bank.
the
question
is
to
whether
or
not,
there
was
a
lien
on
property
where
their
title
had
passed.
the
loss
from
the
disaster
must
be
allocated.
fungibility
as
applied
by
the
courts
in
this
context
is
nothing
more
than
a
device
sometimes
artificial
perhaps
to
determine
the
intent
of
the
parties
that
is
not
otherwise
expressed.
the
intent
of
the
party
is
clear,
there
is
no
problem.
the
man
who
out
his
grain
on
the
grain
elevator
if
he
intended
to
become
a
co-owner,
he
did.
he
can
pledge
his
interest
in
the
undivided
mask
to
the
bank,
the
bank
can
have
a
lien
on
it.
but
if
there's
no
expression
of
intent
and
this
is
where
fungibility
becomes
important,
the
courts
where
the
goods
are
homogenous
have
supplied
an
intent,
an
intent
on
the
part
of
the
parties
to
actually
become
co-owners
of
the
undivided
indivisible
mask
of
commodities.
the
device
as
they
say
is
artificial
under
these
circumstances
but
it's
not
totally
fictitious.
and
it's
fair
and
reasonable.
there
is
no
great
public
policy
involved.
the
object
is
to
reach
justice
between
the
parties
and
to
have
a
workable
rule
that
fits
into
the
practices
of
the
marketplace.
other
cases
discuss
fungibility
in
connection
with
confusion
of
goods.
those
cases
are
low
interesting
because
some
of
them
suggest
that
one
who
voluntarily
puts
his
commodity
into
a
mask
where
it
can't
be
distinguished
from
other
commodities
in
the
same
mask
can't
profit
from
such
voluntary
commingling.
and
indeed,
tortuous
confusion
of
goods
may
lead
to
one
who
does
it
to
lose
the
title
to
what
he
did
own.
and
as
we
know
in
community
property,
states
her
husband
to
get
things
confused
may
find
that
he
can't
segregate
his
separate
property,
he
no
longer
holds
it.
we
feel
that
this
doesn't
have
any
direct
bearing
on
the
case
but
it
illustrates
that
fungibility
as
an
abstract
concept
doesn't
get
us
anywhere.
our
case
is
not
a
dispute
between
private
parties
where
the
intent
of
the
parties
is
an
important
thing
to
define
in
order
to
achieve
justice.
the
intent
that's
important
here
is
the
intent
of
congress
in
the
natural
gas
act.
it
will
also
be
noted
that
there
is
more
make
believe
involved
here
than
in
the
grain
elevator
cases.
there,
an
intent
is
artificially
supplied
where
there's
fungibility.
but
the
intent
that
is
assumed
on
the
basis
of
fungibility,
is
an
intent
to
do
something
that
is
physically,
logically,
and
legally
possible.
that's
to
become
a
co-owner
in
a
mass
of
goods.
that
can
be
contrasted
with
this
case
where
the
intent
is
expressed
by
one
owner
with
respect
to
all
of
his
goods
that
he's
going
to
make
a
separate
use
that
admittedly
is
physically
impossible
of
a
commodity
that
he
is
willfully
commingle
with
other
commodities
in
an
undistinguishable
mask.
this
intent
is
recited
of
course
for
one
purpose
only,
to
escape
regulation
over
a
sale
gas,
a
sale
which
admittedly
is
physically
within
the
terms
of
the
natural
gas
act.
we
don't
feel
then
that
the
general
case
is
talking
about
fungibility
are
important
here.
there
had
been
regulatory
decisions
which
have
referred
to
fungibility
and
have
applied
a
rule
involving
the
natural
gas
act
that
do
depart
from
molecular
identification.
they
have
cut
out
a
federal
jurisdiction
gas
that
cannot
be
molecularly
distinguished
from
other
gas.
and
these
cases
were
referred
to
by
mr.
solomon.
i
won't
discuss
them
in
detail
other
than
to
say
that
they
are
different
from
our
case
in
several
respects.
first
and
most
important
practical
difference
is
the
regulatory
impact
in
both
the
hastings
case
and
the
north
dakota
case.
this
court
said
that
the
federal
power
commission
lack
jurisdiction
over
an
intrastate
transaction
that
was
segregated,
although
molecularly
you
could
not
tell
the
difference
in
the
gas.
but
the
result
in
both
of
those
cases
was
to
lead
regulatory
control
in
the
commission,
in
the
state
where
the
consumer
who
needed
the
protection
resided
that
consumer
could
then
look
as
he
should
look
to
his
own
state
to
protect
his
interest
and
to
his
regulatory
commission
to
see
that
he
had
a
fair
treatment.
that
of
course
is
to
be
contrasted
with
this
case
as
i
explained
at
the
outset.
furthermore,
there
is
a
larger
element
of
fiction
involved
with
respect
to
the
fungibility
question
in
this
case
than
in
those
cases.
in
those
cases,
there
is
no
question
that
the
gas
that
went
to
the
“nonjurisdictional”
source
and
was
in
fact
the
gas
of
the
seller
that
was
a
sale.
the
gas
went
to
the
“nonjurisdictional”
source
and
it
went
to
a
jurisdictional
course
--
purpose.
but
all
of
the
gas
was
a
seller's
gas.
the
fiction
that
was
applied
in
those
cases
was
to
depart
from
a
strict
molecule
pursuit
and
say
that
under
those
facts,
in
the
north
dakota,
there
was
a
tailgate
of
a
plant.
some
of
the
gas
served
communities
in
north
dakota.
others
--
other
of
the
same
stream
of
gas
left
the
state.
at
the
time
of
sale,
it's
true,
you
couldn't
tell
which
molecules
were
going
to
go
where.
but
there's
no
question
that
the
tailgate
of
this
plant,
all
of
the
gas
was
bought
from
one
source
by
one
gas
company
and
there's
no
question
that
those
intrastate
“nonjurisdictional”
deliveries
were
deliveries
of
the
same
gas
that
we're
talking
about.
we
just
couldn't
be
sure
which
molecule
went
which
way.
whereas
in
this
case,
we
know
that
90%
to
95%
of
the
gas,
which
according
to
the
contractual
recitals,
is
to
serve
a
certain
purpose,
it's
never
going
to
get
there.
it's
commingled
in
the
stream
where
it
has
a
very
tiny
proportion
of
the
total
stream.
and
i
would
just
like
to
say
in
closing.
and
we
respectfully
urge
the
court
not
to
reduce
the
protection
which
is
presently
enjoyed
by
the
consumer
under
the
natural
gas
act
as
interpreted
by
this
court
in
the
phillips
decision
in
1954.
