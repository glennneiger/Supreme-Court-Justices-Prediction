mr.
richard
a.
solomon
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
natural
gas
act
gives
the
federal
power
commission
jurisdiction
over
all
sales
of
natural
gas
in
interstate
commerce
for
a
resale.
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
el
paso
natural
gas
company
can
exempt
from
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
over
such
sales.
gas
purchases,
large
gas
purchases
it
makes
to
go
to
its
general
gas
supply
and
to
be
used
primarily
in
interstate
commerce
for
resale
whether
it
can
exempt
some
of
those
purchases
by
specifying
in
its
contracts
with
favored
producers
contrary
to
the
fact
that
such
gas
of
the
favored
producers
will
be
used
either
only
within
the
state
of
production
or
outside
the
state
of
production
but
for
el
paso's
internal
uses
and
hence
not
for
resale.
now,
if
the
lower
court's
decision
here,
if
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
holding
that
by
this
type
of
contract,
gas
can
be
so
exempt
is
upheld,
a
very
serious
gap
will
be
created
in
the
comprehensive
scheme
of
regulation
of
gas
sales
which
this
court
talked
in
catco
case.
my
colleague
mr.
tuttle
is
going
to
go
into
this
matter
in
somewhat
greater
length
and
therefore
all
i
want
to
do
is
to
briefly
here
discuss
some
of
the
potential
magnitude
of
the
problem.
our
statistics
show
that
with
respect
to
the
40
largest
gas
companies
in
the
natural
gas
pipelines
in
this
country,
they
have
on
an
average
of
4%
of
their
total
gas
supply
amounting
to
approximately
$85
million
worth
of
gas
each
year
which
they
consume
and
utilize
in
their
own
operation.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
is
a
lot
of
gas
but
it's
difficult
to
transport
this
gas,
and
long
line,
they
use
it
as
fuel
in
their
compressor
stations.
that's
a
typical
example.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
in
connection
with
their
own
pipeline
operations.
they
have
extraction
plants
and
they
have
compression
plants
and
they
have
switching
devices
and
they
use
gas
as
fuel
to
operate
the
pumps,
et
cetera.
also,
they
lose
some
of
the
amount
of
gas,
just
line
loses.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
pardon
me.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
don't
think
so
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
commission
of
course
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
under
certain
circumstances,
there
might
be
no
commission
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
think
that's
right.
if
you
have
a
single
supplier
providing
gas
for
this
purpose
and
no
other
purpose,
it
would
be
outside
our
jurisdiction,
right.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
don't
want
to
use
the
word
commingle.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
think
no.
yes.
i
want
to
make
also
clear
that
that's
only
one
part
of
the
potential
involved
in
this
case
because
the
other
aspect
of
this
case,
if
the
court's
decision
below
is
valid
would
be
to
exempt
or
they
could
exempt
by
contract
all
purchases
from
producers
in
one
state
which
they
resell
in
the
same
state.
i
can't
give
you
the
figures
as
to
how
large
an
amount
of
gas
would
be
exempted
here,
except
to
say
it's
very
large.
and
in
the
case
of
el
paso,
we're
pretty
sure
it
would
at
least
be
possible
for
el
paso
to
exempt
the
$10
million
worth
of
sales
that
they
make
in
new
mexico
on
the
theory
that
they
bought
that
gas
from
new
mexico
producers
whereas
in
fact
a
very
high
percentage
of
gas
used
in
new
mexico
comes
from
texas.
now,
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
in
dispute
and
i
think
for
purposes
of
the
court,
it
may
be
useful
to
refer
to
a
map
in
the
big
record,
volume
i
of
the
record
and
this
map
appears
at
page
115
at
the
bottom.
at
the
top,
it's
called
exhibit
6
or
in
front,
this
is
485,
the
transcript
page.
it
isn't
too
good
a
map
but
it's
the
best
we
have.
first,
to
refresh
the
court's
recollection,
el
paso
of
course
is
one
of
the
major
natural
gas
pipelines
in
this
country.
its
primary
business
is
purchasing
gas
largely
from
the
west
texas,
new
mexico
field
known
as
the
permian
basin
and
transporting
that
gas
west
together
with
other
gas
that
it
purchases
in
new
mexico
along
the
way,
transporting
that
gas
west
through
new
mexico
and
arizona
to
the
california
border
where
of
course
most
of
the
gas
is
sold
for
resale
in
the
very
large
california
market.
in
addition,
they
sell
gas
for
resale
in
new
mexico
and
arizona.
they
don't
seem
to
sell
very
much
resale
in
texas.
up
to
the
time
of
this
case,
el
paso's
operations
in
texas
were
pretty
much
confined
to
the
west
texas
area
around
the
permian
basin.
and
as
you
all
examined
from
looking
at
this
map,
there
was
one
extension,
the
green
line
here
which
got
over
as
far
as
sonora
but
most
of
their
operations
and
most
of
the
in-gathering
of
gas
in
texas
was
in
the
west
texas
area
of
the
permian
basin.
now,
this
case
has
its
origin
in
el
paso's
attempt
to
tap
the
very
large
east
texas
gas
markets.
this,
they
proposed
to
do
by
building
a
227-mile
pipeline
east,
that's
the
dotted
red
line
in
this
map
from
sonora,
their
present
eastern
terminus
to
the
town
of
three
rivers
in
the
heart
of
the
east
texas
oil
and
gas
field
and
in
order
to
at
least
start
their
operations
in
east
texas.
they
contracted
to
buy
gas
from
the
other
two
respondents
here.
they
contracted
to
buy
100,000
mcf
of
gas
a
day
from
the
lo-vaca
gathering
company.
and
they
contracted
to
buy
70,000
mcf
a
day
from
the
houston
pipeline
company.
these
are
large
amounts
of
gas
purchases
but
not
tremendous.
now,
the
physical
operation
of
this
system
if
this
deal
has
been
consummated,
if
this
deal
is
consummated,
will
be
that
both
lo-vaca
and
houston
will
insert
their
gas
into
this
system
at
three
rivers
and
this
gas
will
flow
west
through
a
new
plant,
the
coquat
station
where
some
of
the
gas
will
be
utilized
through
the
existing
sonora
plant,
on
west,
when
it
gets
to
this
meeting
point
here
about
halfway
through,
it
will
split
it
into
two
other
lines
but
those
two
lines
will
also
go
west
and
eventually
those
lines,
both
of
them
will
go
into
first,
new
mexico
and
then
arizona
and
then
seem
to
join
i
think
eventually
and
go
to
california.
starting
at
sonora
and
increasing
as
you
get
into
the
permian
basin
area,
you
have
other
gas
sources
coming
in
to
the
el
paso
system.
so
that
by
the
time
you
get
into
the
west
texas
areas
over
here,
the
gas
mix
is
largely
other
gas
and
very
small
parts
of
it
are
lo-vaca
gas
or
houston
gas.
apparently,
however,
el
paso
found
great
difficulties
in
getting
either
lo-vaca
or
houston
to
contract
with
them
if
they
are
going
to
subject
themselves
to
the
federal
power
commission's
regulation
over
the
rates
of
their
sale.
and
therefore,
what
el
paso
did
was
first
to
contract
with
lo-vaca
for
a
sale
of
50,000
mcf
of
gas,
later
raised
to
80,000,
which
was
allegedly
to
be
used
by
el
paso
not
over
here
in
texas,
not
even
in
the
permian
basin
but
the
gas
from
el
--
that
they
were
buying
under
this
alleged
restricted
used
contract
is
going
to
be
used
--
it's
going
to
be
used
off
this
map
entirely.
it's
going
to
be
used
to
the
west
of
this
map,
allegedly,
in
el
paso's
compressor
stations
and
other
equipment
in
arizona
and
new
mexico.
and
similarly
with
respect
to
houston,
the
contractual
provisions
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well
i'm
suggesting
--
oh
no,
i'm
not
suggesting.
i
am
stating
that
the
contract
as
the
parties
admit
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
actual
gas
flows
and
that
has
a
practical
matter
of
physics,
it's
admitted
that
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
because
of
the
fact
that
this
long,
before
it
reaches,
where
it's
supposed
to
be
used
for
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
becomes
just
part
of
a
general
stream.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
and
the
houston
case
similarly,
what
they
purported
to
do
was
to
say
lo-vaca
has
got
the
compressor
stations
in
new
mexico
and
arizona,
we
will
take
over
the
firing
of
your
compressor
stations
in
texas,
and
also
one
sale
which
was
being
used
in
texas
by
the
phillips
company
for
which
el
paso
made
sales.
both
as
i
said
justice
harlan,
both
lo-vaca
and
houston
as
well
as
el
paso
have
admitted
on
this
record
that
in
fact
this
gas
becomes
just
part
of
the
general
el
paso
scheme.
and
in
fact,
lots
of
the
el
paso
and
lo-vaca
gas
were
in
fact
flow
through
all
the
way
to
california
for
resale.
and
in
fact,
in
decreasing
--
increasing
amounts,
these
restricted
uses
actually
will
not
be
fired
by
lo-vaca
gas
or
by
houston
gas
but
will
be
fired
by
the
generality
of
the
gas
which
el
paso
takes
into
a
system,
a
very
small
percentage
of
it
which
comes
from
these
people.
and
this
is
not,
i
submit,
merely
a
matter
of
physical
fact.
it's
also
a
matter
of
economic
fact
because
it's
perfectly
clear
that
el
paso
was
not
going
to
bill
the
costly
227-mile
gas
line
halfway
across
the
state
of
texas
in
order
to
buy
gas
in
--
what
in
east
texas,
at
prices
substantially
higher
than
it
was
paying
in
west
texas
in
order
to
get
fuel
for
its
plants
in
west
texas,
new
mexico,
and
arizona.
what
el
paso
was
doing
and
what
this
case
is
about
is
breaking
into
a
new
market
and
finding
that
for
its
own
reasons
which
i'm
sure
the
el
paso
people
thought
were
good,
that
it
had
to
pay
more
money
than
probably
the
commission
would
allow
and
therefore
trying
to,
by
contract,
take
these
packages
of
gas
out
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
made
clear
yesterday
all
of
the
gas
purchases
involved
in
this
case
like
all
of
the
other
gas
purchases
that
el
paso
makes
from
producers
or
intermediate
pipelines
go
into
its
regular
system
and
are
used
primarily
for
sales
in
interstate
commerce
for
resale.
the
only
sense
in
which
these
sales
are
restricted
for
intrastate
or
for
internal
use
by
el
paso
is
that,
the
contracts
between
el
paso
and
the
sellers
purport
to
saw
a
tribute
to
gas.
and
the
majority
of
the
fifth
circuit
below
believed
this
process
which
they
called
contractual
segregation
was
sufficient
to
remove
these
sales
from
the
jurisdiction
of
this
commission
but
i
think
what
we
think
is
the
correct
law
is
summed
up
shortly
and
succinctly
as
probably
as
it
could
be
done
in
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
reeves.
and
i'm
referring
to
page
376
of
the
short
volume
2
of
the
appendix.
and
what
judge
reeves
said
there
was,
whether
gas
is
transported
in
interstate
commerce,
i'm
reading
from
the
first
full
paragraph
on
that
page,
whether
gas
is
transported
in
the
interstate
commerce
or
is
sold
in
interstate
commerce
for
resale
depends
not
on
what
the
party
say
about
the
transaction
but
what
is
done
with
the
gas.
this
court
referring
to
the
fifth
circuit
so
held
in
deep
south
oil
company
and
its
companion
case
shell
oil
company,
both
of
which
were
referred
to
on
our
briefs.
in
decisions
of
analogous
question,
the
supreme
court
has
continually
disregarded
contracts,
which
give
a
fictional
construction
to
business
transactions,
and
then
he
cites
a
series
of
cases,
which
we
also
discuss
in
our
brief.
as
said
in
connecticut
company
versus
the
power
commission,
324
u.s.
515
and
529,
federal
jurisdiction
was
to
follow
the
flow
of
electric
energy,
and
engineering,
and
scientific
rather
than
a
legalistic
or
governmental
test.
and
i
might
just
add
that
this
language
was
used
by
this
court
only
last
year
in
the
colton
case.
now
basically,
this
is
our
argument.
jurisdiction
in
both
the
gas
and
power
fields
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
was
called
federal
power
commission
against
southern
california
edison.
and
it
appears
at
376
u.s.
209,
footnote
5.
this
was
the
case
involving
whether
the
ga
--
whether
the
power
from
boulder
dam
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
is
in
engineering.
there
are
number
instances
where
this
has
been
so
held
by
the
lower
courts
in
this
court.
this
is
really
the
first
time
to
our
knowledge
where
any
lower
court
has
held
that
this
type
of
contractual
segregation
is
permissible.
for
example,
in
the
deep
--
in
the
shell
oil
case
which
i
mentioned
a
second
ago,
their
sale
was
made
by
producers
in
texas
to
a
texas
company
which
processed
the
gas,
which
was
casinghead
gas,
to
extract
natural
gasoline
and
other
products
and
then
sold
what
was
left
to
another
company
which
send
it
in
to
interstate
commerce.
and
it
was
argued
that
that
was
both
a
local
sale
and
that
it
was
not
a
sale
for
resale
since
the
contract
provided
that
the
purpose
of
this
sale
was
for
manufacturer
at
the
second
plant.
but
the
fifth
circuit
simply
said
that
the
legal
determination
of
the
question
rests
not
on
the
parties'
use
of
the
word
manufacture
but
upon
the
actual
disposition
of
the
gas.
now,
judge
reeves
also
said
in
the
same
opinion
that
careful
consideration
of
the
cases
upon
which
the
lower
court
relied
and
upon
which
my
opponents
here
rely
permit
a
finding
--
none
of
them
permit
a
finding
of
“nonjurisdictional”
status
solely
on
the
language
of
the
contract
in
each
case.
in
addition
to
the
language
purporting
to
restrict
the
use
of
gas
or
electricity,
there
was
also
an
actual
flow
of
gas
or
electricity
from
the
“nonjurisdictional”
seller
into
the
particular
restricted
use.
and
with
the
brief
time
i
have
left,
i'd
like
to
discuss
what
i
think
are
the
two
principal
props
for
the
lower
court's
opinion
and
why
he
was
--
why
it
was
wrong.
i
think
this
whole
device
which
was
new
with
el
paso
here
and
which
is
by
no
means
something
which
was
common
in
the
gas
industry
up
to
this
time
of
the
sale.
i
think
this
whole
idea
stems
from
some
language
that
this
court
included
in
the
united
states
v.
puc
of
california
at
345
u.s.
as
the
court
may
remember,
that
case
involved
the
sale
of
gas
by
the
california
electric
company
to
the
navy.
the
navy
took
the
power
in
california
and
transmitted
over
its
lines
into
nevada.
most
of
that
purchased
by
the
navy
was
for
its
own
users,
but
about
17%
was
used
for
resale
to
residents
of
a
housing
project.
given
these
facts,
the
court
had
no
difficulty
in
saying
that
the
entire
transaction
was
jurisdictional.
and
it
brushed
off
with
a
single
work
unsubstantial,
a
claim
that
the
sale
was
not
jurisdictional
because
california
electric
didn't
intend
to
make
sales
for
resale
and
hadn't
so
specified
in
its
contract.
the
court
said,
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
316,
“the
concrete
fact
of
resale
of
some
portion
of
the
electric
energy
transmitted
from
a
state
to
a
point
outside
thereof
invokes
federal
jurisdiction
at
the
outset.”
the
problem
comes
from
the
language
of
the
court
in
the
california
case
in
which
it
suggested,
which
had
left
open
the
question,
as
to
whether
if
california
electric
had
made
two
separate
sales
to
the
navy,
one
for
resale
and
one
for
its
own
use,
whether
the
latter
sale
could
have
been
classified
as
juris
--
as
“nonjurisdictional”.
the
court
citing
its
own
opinion
in
the
penn
water
case
at
343
u.s.
strongly
implied
that
such
a
segregation
would
not
have
been
available
to
split
an
interstate
from
an
intrastate's
dream
of
gas
or
power.
but
it
did
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
problem
might
be
as
it
said
different
with
respect
to
splitting
off
such
a
stream
between
a
purchaser's
own
use
and
the
resale
situation.
now,
i
suggest
that
nothing
in
this
court's
opinion
supports
the
lower
court
decision
here.
all
the
court
was
suggesting
was
that
on
appropriate
circumstances
it
might
be
possible
for
the
sole
supplier
of
a
buyer
as
california
electric
of
course
was
the
sole
supplier
of
the
navy,
to
make
two
separate
sales
to
that
buyer,
one
of
which
would
be
jurisdictional
and
the
other
which
would
not
be
jurisdictional.
thus,
a
pipeline
at
the
end
of
its
pipeline
might
take
the
gas
which
should
had
el
paso,
it
might
take
the
gas
which
had
--
had
been
transporting
and
make
a
sale
--
make
one
sale
to
a
city
for
a
jurisdictional
purpose
and
another
sale
to
the
same
city
for
its
own
use.
the
problem
involved
in
the
city
of
hastings
case
which
was
referred
to
in
the
footnote
in
california
and
which
is
one
of
the
other
major
cases
relied
on
here.
but
in
such
a
situation
of
course
when
the
pipeline
says
that
the
“nonjurisdictional”
sale
is
a
sale
of
my
gas
for
use
in
your
boiler
fuel.
that
is
where
the
fuel
for
use
in
the
boiler
is
coming
from.
it's
not
coming
from
three
or
four
other
sellers.
we
don't
have
a
situation
in
where
the
“nonjurisdictional”
contract
merely
claims
to
be
providing
this
gas,
it
is
providing
this
gas.
now,
the
other
primary
prop
in
the
lower
court's
opinion
for
this
decision
is
the
case
in
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
called
state
of
north
dakota
against
the
federal
power
commission,
which
is
discussed
at
considerable
length
in
the
briefs.
and
which
may
possibly
represent
a
peculiar
situation
in
which
it
limited
amount
of
segregation,
if
you
want
to
use
the
word,
is
possible
in
the
intrastate
field.
the
facts
there
were
that
the
montana-dakota
pipeline
was
buying
gas
from
one
source
in
montana.
it
was
buying
gas
at
the
so-called
tioga
station.
all
of
its
gas
came
from
there.
the
gas
actually
previously
was
85%
from
amerada
and
15%
from
cigna.
but
all
the
gas
they
purchased
was
at
that
point.
they
bought
it
under
two
contracts;
one
of
which
was
admittedly
for
intrasta
–
interstate,
and
the
other
of
which
was
restricted
for
intrastate
deals.
most
of
the
intrastate
gas
actually
went
over
a
separate
line
which
didn't
get
out
of
the
state
at
all.
but
some
of
the
intrastate
gas
traveled
along
with
the
interstate
gas
in
a
line
which
extended
into
wyoming
and
was
siphoned
off
before
it
got
to
wyoming
into
four
small
north
dakota
communities.
and
the
court,
the
eight
circuit
held
in
that
case
that
those
sales
were
intrastate
commerce
because
they
were
made
in
the
state
of
north
dakota
and
never
got
outside
of
the
state
of
north
dakota.
well,
it's
perfectly
clear
i
think
from
my
recital
of
the
facts
that
the
reason
that
they
were
able
to
do
so
was
that
you
didn't
have
between
the
tioga
plant
and
the
four
laterals
to
these
north
dakota
communities
intervening
parties
coming
in
and
bringing
gas.
so
that
it
was
fair
to
say,
that
all
of
the
gas
sold
at
the
tioga
plant
for
intrastate
sale
and
no
other
gas
was
the
gas
that
got
into
these
four
laterals.
the
problem,
i
suggest,
would
be
analogous
to
this
case.
if
instead
of
the
complex
arrangements
we
had,
we
had
only
the
two
lo-vaca
contracts
and
the
“nonjurisdictional”
one
was
limited
to
the
gas
used
at
the
coquat
station
and
a
route
to
sonora.
in
other
words,
it
was
gas
which
had
to
be
from
lo-vaca
because
there
was
no
other
gas
coming
in
to
the
picture.
that
would
be
the
north
dakota
case
presented
here.
and
since
that's
the
case,
we
don't
have
to
get
in
to
the
separate
problem
of
whether
or
not
the
north
dakota
case
is
right
or
not
since
it
again
depends
on
what
this
court
in
california
said
it
was
probably
not
possible
segregation
of
intrastate
and
interstate
gas.
now
finally,
let
me
just
say
a
word
about
what's
not
in
this
case,
although
you
might
be
told
it
is.
and
i'm
referring
now
to
so-called
direct
sales
contracts
where
a
producer
sells
to
an
industry
or
utility
in
a
different
state
and
the
buyer
picks
up
the
gas.
but
because
he
can't
use
it
in
texas
or
louisiana,
he
transfers
it
to
a
pipeline
and
the
pipeline,
in
turn,
retransfers
an
equivalent
amount
of
gas
at
the
other
end
of
the
pipeline.
or
transportation
agreements
as
such
whereby
a
shippers
and
if
they
gives
a
pipeline
gas
and
the
pipeline
gives
him
an
equivalent
amount
of
gas
at
the
other
end
of
the
pipeline.
now,
the
commission
in
this
very
case
may
express
that
it
was
not
holding
those
types
of
transactions
jurisdictional,
and
it
has
never
held
either
type
of
transaction
jurisdictional.
it
does
have
and
i
would
--
do
not
deny
it,
a
proceeding
pending
before,
at
the
present
moment,
undecided
looking
into
the
question
of
transportation
agreements,
because
there
are
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
how
they
should
be
treated.
but
it
hasn't
done
anything
of
this
nature
so
far
and
contrary
to
what
you
may
hear,
a
decision
here
does
not
necessarily
decide
those
other
questions.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
very
simple
in
my
opinion.
there's
a
separate
serious
question
involved
in
calling
direct
sales
or
transportation
agreements,
sales
for
resale.
and
they
are
the
question
which
has
not
been
resolved
as
to
whether
there's
any
sales
relationship
involving
the
pipeline
in
those
cases.
if
there
is
and
maybe
there
are
very
well
might
be,
but
if
there
is,
we
might
have
this
case.
but
whether
there
is
or
not,
has
never
been
determined.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
just
want
to
say
your
honor
–
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
won't
take
more
than
a
minute,
i
just
want
to
say
the
suggestion
that
we
have
allowed
this
type
of
activity
such
as
lo-vaca
and
houston
here
for
25
years
and
are
only
now
stepping
in
to
claim
jurisdiction
just
isn't
true.
this
is
the
first
time
that
anybody's
attempted
this
type
of
contractual
segregation.
if
we've
allowed
things
from
the
last
25
years,
he's
talking
about
the
transportation
deals
which
i
mentioned
before.
there
has
never
been
a
case
like
this
which
the
commission
has
approved
and
unless
this
court
says
we
have
to,
there
never
will.
