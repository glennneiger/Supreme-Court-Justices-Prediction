ms.
constance
baker
motley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
in
this
case
is
a
negro
male
about
20
years
of
age.
and
he
asked
this
court
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
which
affirmed
his
conviction
and
sentenced
to
death
on
a
charge
of
rape.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
raping
a
17-year-old
white
girl
and
was
sentenced
to
death
by
a
heavy
jury
sitting
in
talladega
county,
alabama.
no
negro
has
ever
served
on
a
heavy
jury
in
talladega
county
because
they
are
always
struck
from
the
trial
jury
venire
by
the
states
attorney.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
no
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
they
did
in
this
case
assess
the
penalty
of
death,
that's
the
penalty
in
alabama.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
it's
life
or
death
sentence.
petitioner
claimed
below
of
course
and
asserts
here
that
his
conviction
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
him
in
the
petit
jury
which
tried,
convicted
and
sentenced
him
were
the
products
of
racial
discrimination.
now,
in
a
capital
case
in
this
county,
the
circuit
judge
orders
the
sheriff
to
summon
at
least
50
and
not
more
than
a
100
persons
to
serve
on
the
petit
jury.
about
75
usually
appear
of
the
100
that
are
summoned
and
of
these
numbers
there
will
be
some
who
claim
exemptions
and
others
will
be
excused
for
various
reasons.
and
then
of
the
number
left,
say
there
are
50
left,
the
striking
then
begins
in
this
fashion,
the
states
strikes
one
and
the
defendant
strikes
two.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right,
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right
sir,
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
at
the
early
stage,
the
--
counsel
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right,
yes.
the
counsel
can
challenge
of
course,
others
will
come
in
and
claim
exemption
of
those
called
to
serve.
and
after
all
of
those
exemptions
are
claimed
and
all
of
the
challenges
proposed
then
you
begin
to
strike
from
those
that
are
left
and
it's
usually
as
i
say,
50,
maybe
75
and
you
strike
down
until
you
get
12
and
these
well
constitutes
the
jury.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right,
the
last
12
serve
on
the
jury.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
pardon
me?
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
it
depends
on
the
number
left.
you
say,
you
don't
have
a
set
number
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
what
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
it
varies
depending
upon
the
number
left
of
jurors
after
all
exemptions
and
challenges
of
the
court,
maybe
40
left
or
50.
the
prosecutor
strikes
one,
the
defendant
strikes
two
alternating
until
there
are
12
left,
until
it
--
will
vary
from
case
to
case.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
there's
a
provision
that
if
the
defendant
doesn't
strike,
the
judge
must
strike
for
him
in
the
alabama
law.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
oh,
i
guess
you
can
accept
the
box,
yes,
which
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
of
the
12,
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
what
they
do
is
to
summon
additional
jurors
in
addition
to
those
who
are
summoned
for
the
week.
and
this
may
not
exceed
a
100
in
number
and
of
course
if
they
run
out
they
always
summon
additional
jurors
to
serve.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
its
--
yes,
i
think
so.
i
think
what
happens
is
that
this
extra
number
that
are
called
in
addition
to
those
that
are
there
for
the
regular
trial
for
the
week
or
who
have
already
been
called
is
what
they
referred
to
as
a
special
venire
for
a
capital
case
because
they
usually
do
not
have
as
many
as
a
100
there
for
the
trial
of
a
case
for
that
week.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
then
they
would
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
you
mean,
if
they
have
--
i
don't
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
you
say
there
are
no
more
jurors
left
to
strike
from?
i
don't
think
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
the
--
no,
no.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
i
didn't
understand
your
question
your
honor.
i
thought
i
had
explained
this
but
i
will
say
it
again.
the
--
between
50
and
a
100
are
called
to
serve,
come
in,
some
will
claim
exempt
from
this,
they
are
over
65
or
under
21.
certain
occupations
are
exempt.
then,
others
will
be
challenged
for
cause
reducing
the
number
available
for
actual
service,
there's
maybe
40
or
50.
then
the
striking
begins.
the
defendant
--
the
state
strikes
one,
the
defendant
strikes
two
until
only
12
remains.
those
12
constitutes
the
jury
with
a
trial
of
a
capital
case.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right,
yes.
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
by
both.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right,
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
the
defendant
can
inquire,
and
the
state
may
inquire
and
examine
the
jurors
and
i
understand
the
court
can
excuse
anyone
that
the
court
feels
does
not
qualify
to
serve.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
found
that
there
are
usually
negroes
on
the
venire.
negroes
are
usually
in
the
jury
box
and
called
but
the
negroes
are
always
stricken
and
no
negro
has
ever
served
on
a
petit
jury
in
that
county.
and
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
held
that
the
fact
that
the
prosecution
peremptorily
strikes
every
negro
from
the
jury
panel
in
the
case
where
the
defendant
is
a
negro
does
not
constitute
a
violation
of
the
defendant's
constitutional
rights
of
due
process
or
equal
protection
of
the
law.
clearly
is
felt
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
pardon
me?
ms.
constance
baker
motley
we
attack
the
grand
jury
also.
we
say
that,
that's
our
second
point
here
and
that
is
that
the
grand
jury
and
the
petit
jury
drawn
from
the
same
box
but
what
you
have
here
is
few
negroes
in
that
box
because
the
jury
commissioners
have
not
carried
out
their
constitutional
duty
to
fairly
acquaint
themselves
with
all
qualified
jurors
in
the
county.
they
have
a
very
haphazard
method
of
getting
names
in
that
box
which
favors
a
larger
proportion
of
whites
and
qualified
negroes
are
obviously
not
put
in
the
box.
they
have
a
small
number
to
start
with.
now,
as
i
said,
this
record
clearly
established
that
in
every
case,
negroes
are
struck
from
the
venire
and
the
prosecutor
or
the
solicitor's
own
testimony
is
that
whenever
he
has
a
case
he
goes
over
to
the
lawyer
in
the
other
side.
he
says,
“look,
we
have
some
negroes
here.
do
you
want
to
use
negroes?”
and
if
the
defense
counsel
says
no
and
he
invariably
does
and
if
the
solicitor
doesn't
want
to
use
them
as
he
says,
“we
strike
them
first.”
in
other
words
we
get
--
rid
of
negroes.
now,
the
prosecutors
never
struck
any
negro
because
he
felt
that
a
particular
negro
had
a
bias
against
the
defendant
or
the
state.
he
never
struck
any
negro
because
he
felt
that
a
particular
negro
or
several
negroes
on
that
venire
would
not
afford
a
fair
and
impartial
administration
of
justice.
his
only
consideration
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
but
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
but
there
are
some
instances
where
the
solicitor
cannot
prove
bias,
you
say.
and
if
he
attempts
to
prove
in
a
case
that
a
particular
negro
might
be
biased
in
favor
of
the
defendant
because
he
is
negro
and
fails,
he
may
then
challenge
that
negro
peremptorily
and
that's
not
because
of
the
negro's
race.
he's
then
using
the
preemptory
challenge
in
the
manner
in
which
it
was
intended.
and
that
is
to
eliminate
bias
which
you
could
not
prove
on
which
you
merely
have
a
suspicion
or
a
whim
and
you
get
rid
of
the
negro
that
way.
but
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no.
i
think
that
it
is
not
absolute
in
that
sense.
that
was
never
the
original
purpose
of
the
challenge.
its
purpose
was
to
secure
an
impartial
jury
and
to
provide
for
the
elimination
of
bias
and
it
wasn't
--
i
guess
it
is
used
in
the
manner
which
you
suggest
and
wholly
arbitrarily.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
was
the
original
intention
of
it.
i
think
it's
always
been
limited
by
the
necessity
of
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
for
the
defendant
and
the
public's
interest
in
the
impartial
administration
of
justice.
so
that
in
every
case
i
would
think
that
we
have
--
we
would
have
the
burden
of
course
of
establishing
that
race
was
the
motive
and
it
maybe
difficult
in
some
cases.
but
the
preemptory
challenge
we
say
cannot
be
used
to
and
affect
defeat
the
decisions
of
this
court
construing
the
equal
protection
clause
or
to
violate
the
federal
statute
which
says,
that
no
state
officer
may
exclude
negroes
from
the
jury
on
account
of
race
and
that
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well
again,
the
question
would
be
whether
there
--
that
the
challenges
have
been
used
to
discriminate
against
the
whole
racial
group
in
the
community.
if
he
struck
negroes
because
they
have
to
use
six
challenges
but
whenever
he
struck,
he
always
struck
negro.
we
might
be
able
to
prove
that
even
in
such
a
case
the
prosecutor's
motive
was
racial
discrimination.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
our
position
is
that
the
prosecutor
here
had
a
policy
of
excluding
negroes.
he
did
it
through
the
use
of
preemptory
strike.
he
says
so
because
i
always
strike
negroes.
i
go
overnight,
talk
to
the
other
side
and
i
--
we
come
to
an
agreement
and
we
take
the
negroes
off.
and
this
record
shows
that
his
use
of
the
strikes
was
to
affect
racial
discrimination.
this
court
has
ruled
that
they
cannot
exclude
negroes
from
the
grand
jury
panel
or
the
venire
and
it
shows
that
they
made
some
attempt
here
to
put
some
negroes
on.
but
he
used
this
to
affect
racial
discrimination.
and
our
point
is
that
any
state
prosecutor
who
uses
his
preemptory
challenges
to
affect
this
result,
the
exclusion
of
the
whole
racial
group
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
oh
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
that
--
that's
our
second
point
as
i
pointed
out
before
that
the
striking
is
facilitated
by
the
fact
that
the
jury
originally
composed
that
it's
a
box
as
a
result
of
racial
discrimination.
i
think
the
record
is
clear
here
that
negroes
were
about
26%
of
the
males
in
that
county
over
21.
and
in
other
words
26%
negroes
were
potentially
qualified
but
the
largest
percent
that
had
ever
appeared
on
a
grand
jury
panel
or
petit
jury
panel
was
10%,
12%
or
15%.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
but
we
said
--
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
were
26%
potentially
qualified.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
we
put
on
testimony
to
show
there
were
other
qualified
negro.
i
think
about
13
negroes
out
of
which
12
were
qualified,
met
all
the
other
qualifications.
and
the
one
--
jury
commissioner
even
admitted
that
there
were
probably
negroes
qualified
who
are
not
in
there
because
he
had
made
no
effort
to
ascertain
all
qualified
persons.
and
the
statute
certainly
requires
that.
so
that
it's
clear
by
their
own
admission
that
there
were
negroes
outside
of
this
box
who
were
not
qualified.
and
this
small
number
of
qualified
negroes
being
put
in
the
box
facilitated
the
striking
when
it
came
to
that.
so
you
can
tie
these
two
things
together
of
course,
and
show
that
this
is
clearly
a
case
where
you
have
a
state
policy
of
excluding
negroes
from
their
proper
participation
in
the
administration
of
justice
and
participation
in
the
jury
system.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right,
they
exclude
women.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
if
the
prosecutor
always
strikes
negroes,
if
race
is
a
criterion
and
it
--
and
we
show
that
they
always
strike
negroes.
and
no
negro
ever
serves
because
of
his
policy
of
striking
all
negroes
that
would
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
the
state
cannot
--
yes,
the
state
cannot
use
its
preemptory
challenge
to
exclude
negroes
solely
because
they're
negroes.
because
then
the
state
is
using
a
racial
criterion
for
selecting
the
members
of
the
jury.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right,
yes.
because
this
jury
selection
is
an
important
part
of
the
administration
of
justice.
it's
a
--
an
integral
part
of
the
system
of
justice.
and
we're
saying
that
race
cannot
play
any
part
in
the
administration
of
justice
or
the
jury
selection
process.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
if
i
say
even
in
the
case
of
the
defendant.
i
don't
think
that
race
can
be
allowed
as
a
criteria
and
even
by
the
defendant
because
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
that's
different
because
he's
eliminating
him
for
bias
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
which
he
affects
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
he
can
use
his
preemptory
challenge
to
eliminate
a
negro
that
he
suspects
of
bias.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
i
think
there
would
be
cases
where
that
would
arise
out
of
the
facts
in
the
case.
he
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
no.
in
the
defendant's
case
he
had
no
reason
other
than
race.
he
wasn't
suspecting
bias.
he
wasn't
eliminating
negroes
as
a
part
of
his
file,
strategy
or
anything
like
that.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
what
he
suspects
as
definite
bias
i
would
think
with
respect
to
himself,
he
maybe
white
and
he
says,
“well,
i
don't
want
a
negro
on
my
jury
because
i
am
charged
with
burning
down
a
negro's
house,
and
this
negro
may
be
biased
against
me.
so
i'm
going
to
get
him
off
the
jury.”
now,
he's
suspecting
a
definite
bias.
he
may
not
be
able
to
prove
it
because
he
puts
the
negro
on
and
questions
him
and
he
denies
it
because
i
can
fairly
decides
this
case
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
from
that
kind
of
pattern
we
can
infer
that
racial
discrimination
was
his
motive
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
and
there's
a
case
where
he
admits
that
as
here.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
what
he
said.
that's
his
testimony
on
page
20
and
27
of
the
record.
he
said,
they
always
say
“no,
i
(voice

--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
he
says
--
and
he
says,
“the
only
variation
was
once
we
had
a
negro
accused
of
murdering
another
negro.”
and
he
wanted
to
vary
this
pattern
by
offering
him
an
all-negro
jury.
and
in
other
words,
he
always
took
up
race
as
a
primary
consideration
with
respect
to
the
composition
of
every
jury.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
it
doesn't
indicate
that
precisely
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
in
this
particular
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
by
the
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
by
the
solicitor.
you
see
in
the
instant
case
there
was
a
venire
of
a
100
that's
a
stipulation,
eight
negroes,
six
were
available.
the
prosecutor
struck
all
six.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
right.
well,
i
don't
know
exactly
how
they
got
them
off
but
he
was
--
with
his
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
six
strikes,
he
had
one
at
a
time
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
no
--
that's
right.
and
this
was
the
practice
in
civil
cases
also.
there
were
lawyers
who
testified
that
in
every
civil
case
they
did
this
too.
so
with
a
general
community
pattern
here
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
don't
believe
(inaudible).
i'd
like
to
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
i
don't
understand.
as
far
as
i've
gone,
i
don't
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
oh
no,
we
can
win
on
the
second
point
which
is
that
the
organization
of
the
grand
jury
and
petit
jury
from
the
start
were
the
products
of
racial
discrimination.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes.
well,
i
--
we
have
it
in
our
brief.
i
--
we
referred
to
it
that
what
happened
here
was
that
the
prosec
--
for
the
jury
commissioners
had
a
very
haphazard
method
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
--
which
favored
whites.
as
a
result,
very
few
negroes
actually
got
in
that
box.
i'd
like
to
save
the
three
minutes
i
have
for
rebuttal.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
i
think
mr.
justice
black
if
you
would
looked
at
section
63
of
the
title,
i
don't
have
it
here.
i'm
referring
to
the
alabama
code
title
30
section
63.
i
thought
perhaps
we
had
cited
in
our
briefs
somewhere
but
that's
the
statute
i
believe
you
have
in
mind
which
sets
a
minimum
number
of
juries
to
be
called
in
a
capital
case
of
50
and
no
more
than
a
100.
it
says
the
circuit
clerk
show
directly
share
the
summon
at
least
50
and
no
more
than
a
100
in
a
capital
case.
i
think
if
you
looked
at
that
that
was
the
section.
now
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
not
just
capital
cases.
there
is
a
separate
section
on
felonies
in
general.
now
in
this
case,
i
think
because
we
mentioned
previously
it's
clear
that
the
jury
commissioners
whose
job
was
to
secure
names
for
the
jury
roll
which
was
then
put
in
the
jury
box
relied
on
their
acquaintances,
business
acquaintances
and
social
acquaintances
primarily
in
securing
these
names.
one
jury
commissioners
had
been
pointed
out
and
even
know
the
percentage
of
negroes
in
the
county
he
estimated
it
at
about
10%
where
actually
it's
32%,
26%
being
the
number
of
negro
males
over
21,
so
that
he
had
no
idea
of
the
number
of
negroes
in
the
community
and
then
one
jury
commissioner
on
page
95
of
the
record
he
was
asked,
“have
you
gone
to
any
purely
negro
organizations
for
a
list
of
names?”
and
he
said,
“no.”
the
jury
clerk
who
assisted
the
process
of
getting
the
names
said
she
knew
a
couple
of
negroes
and
this
was
the
extent
of
anyone's
direct
testimony
as
to
knowing
any
particular
negroes.
she
said,
“i
asked
bob
strickland
and
principle
may
vary,
they
send
me
a
list
and
i
asked
another
man
and
he
never
sent
it.”
and
whenever
a
jury
commissioner
was
asked
to
name
some
negroes
he
put
on
the
jury
list.
he
couldn't
even
do
it
as
familiarity
with
negroes
was
so
limited.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well,
he
should
have
some
system
whereby
all
qualified
persons
i
would
think
are
placed
on
the
jury
roll
as
the
statute
here
required.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well
yes.
he
shouldn't
have
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well
he
should
be
able
to
name
some.
there
are
large
numbers
of
negroes
as
he
claimed
that
had
been
put
on
here,
he
ought
to
be
able
to
call
a
few
not
that
he
could
name
every
single
one.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
that's
right.
what
he
should
do
is
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
yes,
that's
right.
i'm
not
saying
he
should
go
out
and
say,
“well,
i've
got
six
negroes
i'm
going
to
put
them
in
the
box.”
ms.
constance
baker
motley
pardon
me?
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well
i
think
the
best
way
that
--
to
get
around
that
is
to
have
an
impartial
method
whereby
you
select
a
large
number
of
qualified
persons.
they
have
no
systematic
method
for
getting
the
names
and
that
would
set
a
couple
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well
if
that's
the
way
or
method
of
getting
it,
if
that's
the
method,
it's
to
get
names
from
organizations
only
then
i
say
they
should
go
to
negro
and
white
organizations
if
this
is
your
method.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
but
they
didn't
have
that
method
particularly,
they
sometimes
went
to
the
jury
to
the
telephone
booth,
sometimes
in
the
city
directory
and
so
forth.
they
failed
to
have
any
system
for
getting
these
names
and
that
led
them
into
trouble
and
it
might
--
ms.
constance
baker
motley
no,
whatever
method
they
used
if
they
used
it
as
the
method
and
that
method
was
used
on
negroes
and
whites
alike,
of
course
that
would
be
all
right.
ms.
constance
baker
motley
well
if
that
were
a
fact
that
they
knew,
that
happened
to
be
the
fact
in
that
community.
that
there
was,
if
they
knew
this
and
this
was
a
matter
of
which
they
used
to
get
what
it
sounds
like.
i
believe
my
time
is
over.
