(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
--
did
they
have
a
special
panel
summoned
for
capital
cases
in
venire?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
statute
only
provided
that
--
those
compelled
to
have
a
special
panel,
is
that
still
the
law
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
to
remind
me
in
telling
this
(inaudible)
you
have
a
special
law
in
talladega
county
with
reference
to
capital
cases
and
how
many
jurors
you'll
draw
or
is
it
carried
by
general
of
state
laws?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
have
a
capital
case,
let's
say
you
have
a
capital
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
talladega.
how
many
jurors
would
you
have
to
have
there,
parties
to
be
strike
on
and
--
under
your
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
it
is
a
minimum.
this
is
not
in
the
statute,
i
thought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
minimum?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
to
summon
and
have
a
100
juror.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
object
to
that
statement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
the
object
was
you
get
both
parties
strike
a
lot
of
people
so
that
they
can
come
as
near
getting
a
fair
jury
responsible.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
wasn't
the
point.
how
many
did
you
get
to
strike
from
in
a
civil
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
for
one
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
had
24
men,
that's
the
rule
as
i
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
because
that's
a
civil,
it's
not
very
important.
how
many
do
you
have
to
have
in
order
to
strike
in
connection
with
a
felony
that's
not
a
capital
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
get
the
idea,
you
do
not
have
a
statute
to
that
which
relates
to
the
capital
cases
only
which
was
passed
for
the
expressed
service
trying
to
see
that
there's
enough
men
there
so
that
when
you
get
through
striking
they
could
come
as
near
as
possible
to
getting
a
fair
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
but
is
there
not
a
minimum
in
capital
cases
that
you
have
to
have,
is
that
the
statute
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there
is
a
larger
number
though
that
we
have
to
have.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
need
to
start
with
more
juries
in
the
capital
case
and
other
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
in
your
statement
you
started
with
a
minimum
of
100?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
excuses
although
it's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
show
that
they
come
(inaudible)
the
statute.
is
it
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
if
it
gets
down
below
what
the
statutes
says
it
has
to
have
to
get
them
into
a
strike,
it
is
send
down
and
get
what
you
call
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
go
down
in
summons
them
and
bring
them
in.
justice
hugo
l.
black
sheriff
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
system
you
have
here
is
they
get
--
the
defendant
gets
two
strikes
and
the
other
--
on
this
mark.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
civil
cases
that's
one
on
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
hall
can
you
explain
to
us
why
was
this
thing
point
--
pointed
out
that
the
commission
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
calling
people's
name
in
the
whole
jury
box.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
--
what
about
the
educational
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
county
how
about
--
what
what's
the
ratio
of
it
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
--
are
there
many
of
the
local
negroes
that
go
through
those
to
the
talladega
county
and
take
advantage
of
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
good
schools
in
talladega.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it's
a
compulsory
education
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
important
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
your
commissioner
say
about
knowing
the
call
of
people
in
this
county?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
testify
--
to
making
it
testify
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you'd
say
with
the
two
on
this
grand
jury,
is
that
true
of
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
summon
all
the
grand
juries
have
been
you
know
statistically
so
you
know
the
statistics
on
them
whether
or
not
they
summoned
each
grand
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
all
that
have
been
left
in
the
box.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
happened
to,
you
don't
have
enough
jurors
over
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
there
is
trial
below
and
that
run
in
the
trial
with
(inaudible)
went
direct
to
the
negroes
and
put
them
on
the
list
of
liberty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
started
a
pretty
tough
job
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
and
(inaudible).
well
he
had
--
they
elect
and
many
left
where
it
is
likely
to
grow
at
the
same
time.
you
must
have
somebody
on
there
show
the
county
how
it
is
going
either,
so
he's
really
got
to
precept
(inaudible)
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
just
took
some
out
of
each
page.
is
that
in
demand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
explain
then
that
the
negroes
didn't
have
a
cell
phone
or
--
