number
64,
robert
swain,
petitioner,
versus
alabama.
senator
motley.
chief
justice
earl
warren
senator,
may
i
ask
you
this
question
please.
i
don't
know
that
i
quite
have
your
point
yet.
but
assuming
that
this
jury
was
intended
legally
in
all
respects
and
they
came
to
the
courtroom
and
the
prosecutor
used
his
challenges,
got
his
preemptory
challenges
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
negroes
from
the
jury.
do
you
then
say
that
that
is
a
state
action
and
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
that's
discrimination
and
this
case
should
be
reversed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
senator,
do
you
happen
to
--
do
you
have
to
go
as
far
as
you
do
to
prevail
in
this
case?
do
you
have
to
go
as
far
as
you
have
just
gone
in
making
this
particular
argument
in
order
to
prevail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
i
mean
is
this,
do
you
have
the
premises
entirely
upon
the
use
of
preemptory
challenges
by
the
prosecution
in
order
to
win
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
we've
heard
very
little
about
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hall.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that
was
to
say
that
the
commissioner
in
saying
that
he
didn't
know
any
negroes
and
therefore
he
did
not
put
him
on
the
panel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
ask
--
i
didn't
say
that.
i
asked
you
that
question.
i
asked
you
if
that
would
justify
the
commissioner
in
saying
“well,
i
did
know
any
negroes
or
i
didn't
know
whether
there
are
any
qualified
or
not
so
i
didn't
put
any
negroes
on
the
panel.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
your
pardon
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is
a
hypothetical
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
they
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
wasn't
there
--
didn't
one
of
the
commissioner
say
what
was
almost
tantamount
to
what
i've
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
did
they?
wasn't
there
one
who
at
least
who
said
that
he
did
not
go
to
any
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
didn't
go
to
any
of
the
negro
clubs
or
organizations
but
he
did
go
to
the
whites.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
that
he
did.
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
churches?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
didn't
know
of
any
negro
churches.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
one
apple
can
spoil
a
box
you
know
too.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
take
this
county
as
far
as
you
know
and
as
far
as
any
of
the
witnesses
in
this
case
knew
has
there
ever
been
a
negro
set
on
a
jury
in
this
county
in
either
a
civil
or
criminal
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
petit
jury,
yes
sir.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
record
shows
to
the
contrary
that
that
is
not
correct.

justice
