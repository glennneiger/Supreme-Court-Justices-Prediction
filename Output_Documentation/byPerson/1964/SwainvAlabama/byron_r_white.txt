what
if
the
defendant
so
thinks
that,
say
there's
a
negro
defendant
and
thinks
that
a
negro
would
be
--
just
because
he's
a
negro
would
be
biased
against
the
negro
defendant
and
it's
not
just
that
--
i
mean
the
--
the
fact
that
he's
a
negro
means
bias
to
him
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
isn't
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
a
little
bit
different?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
now
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
let's
say
the
prosecutor.
prosecutor
eliminates
a
juror
because
he's
a
negro,
only
because
he's
a
negro
but
only
because
he
thinks
that
this
particular
negro
might
be
biased.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
but
it's
only
--
the
only
reason
he
suspects
him
is
because
he's
a
negro?
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly
does
in
the
defendant's
case.
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
that's
--
in
the
case
of
the
defendant
exercising
his
preemptory
challenges.
when
he
says,
“the
reason
i'm
going
to
strike
this
one,
this
negro,
is
just
because
he's
a
negro.
i
think
he's
--
because
i
think
he
would
be
bias.
that's
the
only
reason
i
think
it
would
be
bias
because
he's
a
negro.”
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
point
is
on
the
prosecution
side,
(inaudible)
--
exercising
any
preemptory
challenges
is
that
it
may
be
that
you
couldn't
successfully
challenge
every
preemptory
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
challenge
that
a
prosecutor
made
just
because
the
fellow
was
a
negro.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
may
not
be
able
to
do
that
but
it's
certainly
true
you
say
that
every
negro
on
every
jury
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
does
the
defend
--
what
kind
of
--
how
come
the
prosecutor
gets
this
kind
of
an
answer
when
he
asked
the
defendant
--
defense
counsel,
“do
you
want
negroes
on
the
panel,”
and
the
--
and
is
this
true
that
the
defense
counsel
answers,
“no,
i
don't
want
negro
from
the
panel.”
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
never
got
any
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
do
you
have
any
--
are
there
any
figures
or
any
evidence
this
record
as
to
how
many
times
or
what
part
of
the
negroes
who
were
thrown
off
or
thrown
off
by
the
defense
over
the
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
assume
there's
someone
out
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
all
the
negroes
eliminated
from
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
from
the
federal
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
--
although
and
so
he
had
to
do
it
three
times.
he
got
two
off
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
at
least
none
of
them
were
--
none
of
them
was
eliminated
by
the
defense?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
this
question
asked
in
this
case
of
defense
counsel?
do
you
want
any
negroes
on
the
jury?
