again,
they
obviously
can
impose
the

penalty.

it

in

discretion,

the

its
going

there's

they
begin
with
30
or
40.
justice

and
then
you
reduce
it
to
twelve.
justice

on
a
one-to-two
basis?
justice

stewart
is
there
interrogation
of
the

by
counsel

by

court?
justice

oh,
prior
to
this
--
justice

--
preemptory
striking?
justice

stewart
--
individually?
justice

stewart
but
those
reasons
would
be
all
be
for
cause,
i
suppose
if
you
could
show
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
we're
talking
now
about
preemptory
challenges
and
i
--
that
the
very
word
preemptory
as
well
as
the
history
of
preemptory
challenges
indicates
that
i
had
thought
that
the
person
could
be
as
capricious,
whimsical,
arbitrary
or
prejudiced
as
he
wanted
to
be
--
justice

in
challenging
the
jury.

21,
weren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
is
there
only
men
jurors
in
alabama?
justice
potter
stewart
supposing
that
you're
argument
goes
farther
than
that.
that
a
state
allows
any
preemptory
challenges
at
all
then
you
have
to
assume
that
some
people
are
going
to
be
prejudiced
against
negroes.
some
lawyers
or
their
client
are
not
going
--
or
want
negroes
on
their
jury
for
a
very
a
prejudicial,
capricious
and
arbitrary
reason
and
that
the
state
therefore
is
authorizing
that
could
be
done
whether
it
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
by
the
prosecutor
or
by
defense
counsel
or
in
a
civil
case.
justice

in
some
of
those
legislation
that
was
peculiar
to
talladega
county
unlike
with
the
petitioner's
brief
in
the
appendix
they
have
the
main
statutory
provisions
is
that
on
the
top
of
the
8
(a)
that
the
--
that
the
special
legislation
begins
which
is
peculiar
to
this
county,
well,
and
goes
all
the
way
through
the
--
through
11
(a).
justice
potter
stewart
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
set
out
that
various
constitutional
provisions
in
alabama
statutes
and
that
most
of
them
seems
to
be
of
general
application
and
i'm
asking
whether
the
ones
of
exclusive
application
to
this
county
begin
at
the
top
of
8
(a)
and
end
at
11
(a)
that's
in
the
information.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
excuse
me?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
have
a
statutory
test
and
i'm
reading
now
from
the
bottom
of
4
(a)
and
the
top
of
5
(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief
but
requiring
to
assess
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
jury
duty
of
men
that
--
be
over
21
and
each
--
as
to
generate
it,
it
reputed
to
be
honest
and
intelligent
and
esteemed
in
the
community
for
its
integrity,
good
character
and
sound
judgment.
i
supposed
it's
not
only
a
matter
of
perhaps
white
jury
commissioners
not
being
acquainted
with
negros
but
perhaps
also
a
manner
that
because
of
75
years
of
more
thought
patterns
and
social
customs
down
there
they
--
they
are
perhaps
would
be
fewer
negros
who
had
that
general
reputation
in
the
community
at
large
but
for
those
qualities
and
that
would
be
quite
acquainted,
is
that
right.
justice
potter
stewart
--
a
general
refute
for
qualities
of
honest,
intelligent,
esteemed
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
matter
of
a
fact
whether
or
not
the
jury
commissioners
would
--
whether
there
would
be
as
many
proportionately
as
many
negroes
who
had
this
estimation
of
the
community
at
large,
as
there
would
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
an
ideal
world,
he
wouldn't
be
able
to
do
it,
would
he?
he
should
know
both
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
should
be
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
he
should
know,
i
put
so
many
negroes
on.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
--
you
suggest
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
--
to
go
to
all
negro
organizations
to
--
to
(inaudible).
justice

stewart
i
see.
