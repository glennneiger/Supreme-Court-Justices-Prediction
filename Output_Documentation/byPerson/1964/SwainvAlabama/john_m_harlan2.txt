i
know
but
in
this
case
and
there
is
much
better
cases
that's
the
solicitor

who
likes
the
negroes.
why
do
you
--
supposed
the
negro
--
this
just
strikes

no
--
justice

the
same
striking
procedure

you
start
out
with
a
number
of
jurors
and
then
there
is
the
alternate
strike
when
you
get
to
the
jury.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
statewide?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
does
--
does
striking

to
stop
when
you
get
to

justice
john
m.
harlan
you
can't
go
on
striking
and
enforce
the
calling
of
more
jurors.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
end
of
it?
justice
john
m.

what
you
say.
justice
john
m.
harlan

you
agree
that
all
of
the
strikes
of
this
case
were
made
by
the

of
negroes
were
made
by
the
prosecution?

--
i
just
wondered
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
this
record,

it
show
that
all
of
the
negroes
who
were
stricken
were
stricken
by
the
prosecution,
is
that
