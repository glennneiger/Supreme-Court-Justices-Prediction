mr.
leslie
hall
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i'm
quite
surprised
that
mrs.
motley
didn't
go
into
the
other
questions.
she
saves
three
minutes
for
that.
i'm
also
surprised
that
she
spent
so
much
time
on
this
particular
thing.
because
it's
been
pointed
out
time
and
time
again
that
various
courts
throughout
the
country
including
a
court
from
mr.
justice
clark's
own
state
that
the
matter
of
preemptory
challenges
is
a
manner
that
it
is
reserved
exclusively
for
counsel
on
each
side.
they
don't
have
to
assign
any
reason.
the
counsel
does
not
have
to
say,
why
he's
challenging
a
person
when
he
is
exercising
his
preemptory
challenge.
he
may
not
as
one
of
the
justices
pointed
out,
may
not
like
the
color
of
the
tie
of
the
person's
wearing.
he
may
not
like
the
color
of
his
shirt
he's
wearing.
he
may
not
like
the
color
of
his
eyes.
it
reminds
me
of
a
case
that
i
was
retained
on
back
in
1936
when
i
first
started
practicing
law
down
in
baldwin
county,
alabama.
there
was
a
lawyer
up
in
mobile
by
the
name
of
henry
aldrich
who
was
not
too
well
acquainted
with
the
residence
in
baldwin
county.
and
that
particular
case
involved
and
a
ejectment
who
had
decided
he
was
going
to
takeover
a
piece
of
land
down
there
in
the
swamps
up
above
the
--
in
the
tensaw
river,
up
above
callaway
and
that
goes
over
to
mobile.
being
a
native
of
baldwin
county
henry
aldrich
who
was
one
of
my
classmates
asked
me
if
i
would
associate
with
him
for
the
purpose
of
striking
the
jury
and
that
was
the
only
reason
that
i
was
hired
in
that
particular
case
was
to
strike
the
jury.
my
purpose
in
that
case
was
to
strike
all
county
farmers,
renters,
share
croppers
and
any
other
person
that
had
no
interest
in
owning
property.
when
we
got
through
the
strike
in
the
jury
we
round
up
with
the
jury
of
all
land
owners.
the
case
was
trialed
for
three
days.
at
the
end
of
the
trial
of
the
case,
we
won
the
case.
we
did
not
have
to
assign
a
reason
why
we
struck
any
by
the
oath
of
that
jury.
there's
no
reason
in
the
world
why
i
have
to
assign
when
i
am
prosecuting
a
case
or
defending
a
case
why
i'm
striking
a
negro
or
i'm
striking
a
mexican,
why
i
am
striking
a
china
man
or
anybody
else
of
a
jury
as
long
as
i'm
right
exercising
my
preemptory
challenge.
now,
of
course
when
i
get
down
to
the
point
of
striking
for
cause
then
i
have
to
have
a
good
reason.
and
i
think
all
the
members
of
the
court
know
that.
i
think
all
the
members
of
the
court
have
trialed
cases
from
time
to
time.
what
--
his
--
judge
grooms
was
pointed
out
in
a
class
action
that
was
brought
down
in
birmingham
two
and
a
half
years
ago
when
it
was
trialed
with
reference
to
jefferson
county
in
particular
and
then
later
on
back
in
october
and
i
was
in
that
case
with
regard
to
the
(inaudible).
judge
grooms
in
the
decision
just
handed
down
the
other
day
on
the
second
of
december
said
“the
number
of
preemptory
challenges
in
both
civil
and
criminal
cases
is
fixed
by
statute.
the
exercise
of
such
preemptory
charges
is
resting
exclusively
with
the
parties.”
mr.
leslie
hall
mr.
justice
black
the
manner
of
filling
the
jury
roll
and
filling
the
jury
box
is
governed
by
a
special
statute
in
talladega
county
but
the
general
law
in
alabama
still
applies
as
far
as
the
selection
of
the
members
of
the
panel
of
the
venire
is
concerned.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leslie
hall
the
judges
are
required
to
--
normally
he
has
a
venire
of
say
of
50
or
60
and
then
he
is
required
to
draw
up
to
a
100.
mr.
leslie
hall
that's
right,
that's
great.
mr.
leslie
hall
a
100
on
a
capital
case.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
don't
know
what
the
object
is.
it's
been
a
traditional
from
way
back,
you
know
when
you
practice
some
law
down
there
it
was
--
mr.
leslie
hall
well
of
course
we
have
a
lot
of
people
that
come
in
who
were
exempt
for
various
reasons.
we
have
almost
say
a
different
categories
of
people
who
exempt
from
jury
duty.
mr.
leslie
hall
in
a
civil
case?
mr.
leslie
hall
normally
about
40,
30
or
40
because
in
a
civil
case
you
strike
one
for
one.
mr.
leslie
hall
right.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
they
usually
have
maybe
40
to
50
there
is
no
particular
set
number.
now
(voice
overlap)
there
was
a
point,
he
was
asked
if
--
mr.
leslie
hall
well
now,
it
has
been
my
experience
with
that
particular
thing
though
sometimes
we
ran
out
of
a
number
of
people,
a
lot
of
them
have
asked
to
be
excused
for
various
reasons
that
some
of
them
don't
believe
in
capital
punishment.
some
of
them
are
--
mr.
leslie
hall
not
that
i
know
of,
no.
mr.
leslie
hall
no,
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
what
--
what
normally
happens
in
the
case
and
it
has
been
my
experience
and
i've
tried
them
in
various
places
in
alabama
is
when
you
run
down
to
say
about
40
then
the
judge
goes
out
and
has
the
sheriff,
summons
people
from
around
the
courthouse
and
from
around
the
business.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
well
that's
what
they
normally
summons,
yes
sir.
it
starts
with
a
100.
but
a
lot
of
them
come
in
and
say
we
don't
want
to
serve,
we
are
over
age,
we
are
railroad
engineers,
we
are
conductor
on
trains,
we
are
telegraph
operator.
we
are
teachers,
we
are
doctors
and
--
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
and
some
of
them
are
hard
in
hearing
and
so
forth.
mr.
leslie
hall
(inaudible),
yes
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leslie
hall
that's
right.
mr.
leslie
hall
in
--
in
criminal
cases.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leslie
hall
so
far
in
the
appendix?
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
well
now
i
think
the
commissioners
did
the
best
they
could
under
the
circumstances
to
--
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
didn't
understand
the
alabama
supreme
court
to
say
that.
mr.
leslie
hall
well
you
might
be
right.
mr.
leslie
hall
well
now
i
want
to
be
practical
about
this
thing.
yes,
and
i
think
it's
impossible
for
any
jury
commission
to
go
out
and
get
every
male
citizen
between
21
and
65
whether
he
is
white
or
whether
he
is
negro.
it
is
impossible
to
do
it.
they
go
out
and
do
the
best
they
can
with
the
facilities
that
are
available
to
them.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
think
you
found
there
by
reading
this
record
here
that
they
made
a
determinant
effort
by
doing
--
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
your
honor
that
is
a
hypothetical
question
--
mr.
leslie
hall
i'll
say
and
i
think
there
is
a
hypothetical
question.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
i'm
not
going
to
say,
whether
they
could
or
couldn't
do
it
but
i'm
talking
about
this
particular
case
mr.
chief
justice
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
he
might
have
said
it
but
the
other
said
that
they
went
out
into
their
plants.
they
looked
over
the
board
of
registration
list.
they
conducted
planned
marriages
which
have
both
negroes
and
whites.
they've
contacted
the
--
various
farm
organizations
that
negroes
and
whites
belong
to
--
mr.
leslie
hall
well
he's
going
to
bring
them
into
the
(voice
overlap)
anything
with
just
one
man.
mr.
leslie
hall
it
didn't
say
he
went
to
the
white
organizations.
mr.
leslie
hall
well
you
just
see
they
didn't
know
of
any
negro
organizations
now,
let's
put
it
that
way.
mr.
leslie
hall
that's'
right.
mr.
leslie
hall
well
he
might
have
known
some
negro
churches,
that
may
have
been
one
man
but
there
are
three
members
of
the
jury
commission
in
this.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
that's
true.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes,
i
understand
you.
now,
that
--
that
same
thing
would
apply
to
white
people.
mr.
leslie
hall
well
i
think
you
found
that
the
talladega
county
has
in
much
better
shape
than
some
of
the
other
counties
in
alabama
and
of
course
that
particular
situation
is
concerned.
mr.
leslie
hall
well
i'm
not
going
to
make
any
admissions
but
i
know
that
there
are
some
counties
here
that
we
have
been
trying
to
work
on
to
try
to
get
them
to
improve
the
situation
down
there.
and
so
that
cases
like
this
won't
come
up
here
and
i've
been
one
of
those
that
has
been
really
working
on
that
particular
situation
and
i
feel
like
talladega
county
is
in
much
better
shape
and
mostly
all
of
the
rest
of
the
counties
except
jefferson
county.
jefferson
county
is
in
good
shape.
butler
county
is
in
better
shape
than
it
was.
mobile
county
is
in
good
shape.
baldwin
county
is
in
good
shape.
mr.
leslie
hall
there
were
two
negroes
that
served
on
the
grand
jury
that's
been
indicted
this
man.
mr.
leslie
hall
well
now,
i
can't
be
responsible
for
that.
now
if
you
will
--
if
you
will
--
it
even
depends
on
prosecuting
the
case.
you
would
use
your
own
judgment
as
to
whom
you
were
going
to
strike
off,
wouldn't
you?
and
you
wouldn't
ask
anybody's
opinion
about
it,
would
you?
mr.
leslie
hall
we've
had
some
served
down
in
--
in
butler
county
and
greenville,
alabama.
recently
--
mr.
leslie
hall
on
a
petit
jury?
mr.
leslie
hall
not
that
i
know
of,
the
record
they
didn't
show
it.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes
--
that's
right.
mr.
leslie
hall
that
they're
only
venire,
yes
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
i've
never
tried
a
case
in
that
county,
i
don't
know.
mr.
leslie
hall
right.
i
have
a
bit
of
good
idea
from
my
own
experience
and
find
cases
in
virginia
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
now
in
alabama
and
representing
that
because
i
was
--
say
that
i
have
a
very
good
idea
of
what.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
i've
explained
that
in
my
brief.
every
time
i
represent
one
of
the
defendant
and
he
said
that
i
don't
want
a
negro
sitting
on
the
jury
and
trying
me.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
haven't
discussed
that
with
the
solicitor.
i
don't'
have
any
idea.
mr.
leslie
hall
he
then
--
he
don't
have
to
assign
a
reason,
does
he
mr.
justice
clark?
mr.
leslie
hall
well
of
course
the
grand
jury
is
concerned,
the
judge
who's
names
out
of
the
hat.
do
that
mean
look
at
them?
there
is
no
distinction
as
far
as
the
colors
of
the
cards,
the
textures
of
the
cards,
there
is
no
marked
on
the
cards,
or
anything,
you
start
forming
them
out
until
it
gets
18
men.
mr.
leslie
hall
it
gets
the
cards
out
of
the
jury
box.
the
jury
box
is
locked
up
until
it's
brought
into
the
courtroom.
mr.
leslie
hall
no,
we
don't
have
wheel.
we've
got
a
--
a
box
that
it's
kind
of
like
a
safety
deposit
box,
a
steel
box
that
has
kept
locked
and
kept
in
the
probate
judges
office.
mr.
leslie
hall
they
come
off
the
jury
room.
mr.
leslie
hall
the
--
in
this
particular
county
and
some
--
most
all
or
every
county
in
alabama,
the
second
clerk
is
automatically
the
clerk
of
the
jury
commissioner
and
he
operates,
he
or
she
operates
under
the
directions
of
the
jury
commissioner.
in
jefferson
county
they
have
a
full
time
clerk
and
--
mr.
leslie
hall
in
this
county
the
second
clerk
access
the
clerk
of
this
jury.
mr.
leslie
hall
they
have
three
commissioners
appointed
by
the
government.
mr.
leslie
hall
they
go
out
and
try
to
find
the
names
of
qualified
men
to
go
into
the
--
on
the
jury
roll
first
and
then
after
we
go
in
the
jury
roll
the
jury
box
is
made
up,
from
the
names
on
the
jury
roll--
mr.
leslie
hall
yes
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
well
no.
i
can
explain
it
to
you
a
little
bit
more
in
detail,
they've
got
a
great,
big
book
and
they
put
down
the
names
by
precincts
in
the
various
areas
of
the
county.
and
then
they
take
those
names
off
and
put
them
on
cards
and
put
those
cards
in
a
box
and
the
box
is
locked
up.
once
those
names
are
drawn
out
they're
not
used
again
for
two
more
years
and
those
names
are
separated
from
the
other
names
that
are
in
the
jury
box.
mr.
leslie
hall
well
it
depends
on
how
many
names
are
on
the
roll.
they
put
every
one
of
the
names
that
are
on
the
roll.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
leslie
hall
they
do
in
making
up
the
rule,
but
they
make
up
the
rule
every
two
years.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
they
make
up
the
roll
and
then
their
cards
come
off
the
roll.
mr.
leslie
hall
sir?
mr.
leslie
hall
not
now.
there
was
a
time
back
there
in
scottsboro
cases
when
it
was
and
even
some
of
the
candidates
happened
to
recently
and
told
the
attorney
general,
alabama
attorney
general's
office
got
after
about
that
thing
when
they
--
they
stopped
doing
it
but
they
don't
do
it
anymore
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
leslie
hall
are
you
talking
about
the
talladega
county?
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
now
--
mr.
leslie
hall
the
solicitor
attempted
to
go
into
that
and
explain
why.
they
want
more
negroes
names
on
the
roll
and
consequently
in
the
box
and
even
into
some
things
that
i
don't
particularly
condone
as
far
as
incidence
of
sexual
diseases
and
illegitimacy
and
things
of
that
sort
i've
come
to
say,
but
that
is
in
the
record
and
i
have
to
admit
it
it's
in
there.
mr.
leslie
hall
well
the
educational
qualifications
--
they
work
a
whole
lot
new
with,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
leslie
hall
well,
i
don't
know
if
this
record
shows
it
now
but
you
will
find
it
almost
in
every
county
in
alabama
the
ratio
of
dropouts
and
those
are
starting
into
1st
grade,
who
finish
in
the
12th
grade
as
compared
with
the
whites
about
90%
of
the
whites
finished
and
about
50%
of
the
negroes
finished.
mr.
leslie
hall
not
(inaudible),
they
come
from
other
parts
of
the
state.
mr.
leslie
hall
very
good
schools,
yes
sir.
very
good
schools
in
tuskegee
mr.
leslie
hall
yes
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
but
a
lot
of
those
get
the
education
and
we
find
it
is
true.
almost
--
in
all
of
these
rural
areas
of
alabama,
those
that
do
get
the
education
leave.
they
don't
stay.
they
go
to
north.
they
go
to
detroit,
in
new
york
and
chicago
and
various
other
places.
so
that
it
leaves
the
old
people.
the
ones
that
either
illiterate
or
infirmed
or
too
old
or
something
of
that
sort,
so
we
don't
have
to
(inaudible)
other
than
school
teachers
and
school
teachers
invariably
claim
their
exemption
and
of
course
most
of
the
school
teachers
are
women
and
then
outlive
what
the
jury
says.
mr.
leslie
hall
well
they
all
know
practically
all
of
them
in
--
in
the
rural
counties.
mr.
leslie
hall
two
of
them
--
i
think
maybe
all
three
of
them,
do
you
remember
the
issue
about
it.
mr.
leslie
hall
all
testified.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
know
that
because
--
if
i
am
guilty
of
various
disqualifying
pranks,
of
course
that's
true
of
a
lot
of
white
people
too
but
we
would
find
the
percentages
larger
among
the
negro
population
and
then
you
do
among
the
white
--
mr.
leslie
hall
no,
i'm
not
trying
to
cast
any
displacement
from
this,
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
leslie
hall
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
leslie
hall
there
were
two
among
this
grand
jury
that
indicted
this
man
for
rape
over
a
white
girl.
mr.
leslie
hall
well
they
have
been
summoned
quite
a
few
grand
juries,
there
has
been
some
grand
juries
that
haven't
had
negroes
on
them.
but
what
in
a
particular
reason
why
there
happened
to
be
on
this
--
this
grand
jury,
they
--
they
just
--
that's
the
way
the
ball
bounced.
mr.
leslie
hall
they
don't
put
anybody
on
the
grand
jury.
the
judge
pulls
the
names
of
the
--
mr.
leslie
hall
they
don't
make
any
effort
to
do
that,
no
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
that's
right.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
that's
right
and
of
course
if
you
--
mr.
leslie
hall
oh,
when
you
get
down
to
12
that's
your
jury?
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
that's
right.
(voice
overlap)
of
course,
you've
got
this
--
you
got
the
challenges
per
call
at
first.
mr.
leslie
hall
yes.
mr.
leslie
hall
then
you
can
go
out
and
get
some
(inaudible),
that's
right.
and
from
the
area
around
the
court
that
was
where
they
usually
do
it,
you
know?
mr.
leslie
hall
there
is
some
testimony
to
that
effect,
yes
sir.
mr.
leslie
hall
and
whether
that
was
asked
in
this
particular
case,
the
record
doesn't
show
it
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
leslie
hall
it
is
possible,
where
they
–
because
--
mr.
leslie
hall
well
if
i
were
--
the
prosecutor
probably
do
the
same
thing.
mr.
leslie
hall
i
don't
know
whether
the
record
shows
that
or
not.
mr.
leslie
hall
is
there
--
