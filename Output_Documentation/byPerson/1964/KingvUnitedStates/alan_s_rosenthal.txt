mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
understand
it
on
the
faces
of
the
petitioner's
argument
this
morning,
they
recognized
that
the
first,
the
second,
and
third
questions
which
were
presented
in
their
brief
in
the
merits,
not
properly
before
this
court
because
they
were
not
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
or
indeed
in
either
of
the
courts
below.
for
that
reason
if
the
court
pleases,
i
will
confine
myself
to
the
single
question
which
is
properly
before
this
court
as
having
been
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
and
having
been
an
issue
in
the
courts
below.
that
question
if
the
court
pleases
is
whether
a
distributing
agent
appointed
in
a
chapter
11
arrangement,
who
fails
to
honor
the
government's
debt
priority
under
section
191,
subjects
himself
to
personal
liability
under
section
192
for
the
amount
of
the
government's
indebtedness
that
was
entitled
priority.
now
the
question
as
it
arises
in
the
context
of
this
case
breaks
down
into
two
parts.
the
first
part
is
the
part
to
which
mr.
justice
harlan
referred.
namely,
are
fiduciaries
of
this
type
called
in
this
case
the
distributing
agent,
are
fiduciaries
of
this
type
within
the
reach
of
section
192
at
all.
now
then
on
this
question,
there
is
concededly
a
conflict
between
the
circuits.
and
indeed
it
is
because
of
this
conflict
that
the
united
states
acquiesces
in
the
petition
and
presumably
it
was
because
of
this
conflict
that
this
court
granted
certiorari.
the
second
question
is,
assuming
that
distributing
agents,
this
type
of
fiduciary,
comes
within
the
range
or
reach
of
section
192
is
that
the
defense
in
an
action
of
this
kind
that
the
distribution
made
by
the
fiduciary
was
pursuant
to
a
court
approved
order.
now
it
is
the
position,
if
the
court
pleases,
of
the
united
states
first
that
as
the
court
below
held
section
192
does
reach
fiduciaries
such
as
mr.
king.
and
secondly
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
admitted
circumstances
of
this
case,
it
is
no
defense
that
mr.
king's
payments
were
under
a
plan
of
distribution
which
had
ben
approved
by
the
referee.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
your
honor,
we
would
suggest
this.
and
that
is
that
if
the
plan
of
arrangement
is
approved
by
the
referee,
first
with
full
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
priority
claim
in
the
picture.
and
second,
with
the
united
states
having
been
given
notice
by
the
debtor
or
by
the
distributing
agent
of
the
fact
that
this
plan
arrangement
is
being
considered
for
confirmation.
if
then
the
court
or
the
referee
were
to
disregard
the
government's
priority
with
full
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
the
priority,
and
with
the
full
opportunity
to
the
united
states
to
defend
this
priority
claim
before
the
referee
in
that
limited
of
circumstances,
we've
indicated
in
our
brief,
we
would
concede
that
the
distributing
agent
would
not
be
liable
for
executing
the
court's
orders.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
that
is
correct
your
honor.
now
that
is
quite
a
different
case
from
that
which
is
presented
here.
i
might
point
out
that
the
bankruptcy
act
itself
in
chapter
11
specifically
makes
provision
for
priority
claims.
section
337
for
example
provides
that
the
debtor
shall
deposit
the
money
necessary
to
pay
all
debts
which
have
priority.
section
367
(2)
provides
that
upon
confirmation
of
the
arrangement,
the
money
which
the
debtor
has
deposited
for
priority
debts
shall
be
dispersed
to
the
persons
entitled
thereto.
so
there
is
a
contemplation
in
the
act
itself
that
the
debtor
as
a
condition
proceeding
to
the
approval
of
his
plan
of
arrangement
shall
deposit
the
moneys
which
are
necessary
to
pay
off
priority
claims
and
upon
confirmation
of
the
arrangements,
those
claims
will
be
paid
properly.
now
the
order
which
appointed
mr.
king
in
this
case,
which
appears
at
page
11
of
the
record,
directed
the
debtors.
this
is
the
corporation
of
which
mr.
king
was
the
president
to
deposit
with
mr.
king
the
moneys
necessary
to
pay
all
debts
which
have
priority.
so
this
was
of
course
executing
the
provisions
of
section
337.
now
what
happened
in
this
case
was
the
plan
of
arrangement,
amended
plan
of
arrangement,
came
on
for
confirmation
and
at
that
point
the
referee
raised
the
matter
of
this
priority
claim
of
the
united
states.
and
as
the
court
has
noted
itself,
mr.
freeman,
the
counsel
for
the
debtor,
specifically
stated
that
there
would
be
at
all
times
$94,000
available
to
pay
that
claim.
now
the
referee
has
stated,
and
this
can
be
found
on
page
16
of
the
record,
that
the
confirmation
on
his
part
was
conditioned
upon
a
provision
or
payment
of
the
government's
claim
if
allowable
up
to
$94,000,
this
was
pursuant
to
what
mr.
freeman
had
stated.
the
result
of
it
here
is
that
there
was
a
plain
violation
by
mr.
king
of
his
duty.
when
he
drew
up
these
checks
and
presented
them
to
the
referee
for
countersigning
without
having
seen
to
it
that
the
debt
of
the
united
states
was
protected
as
mr.
freeman
has
stated
it
would
be.
but
we
would
say
here
tat
the
game
that
the
issue
of
knowledge,
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
has
been
plans
with
the
order
that
would
come
in
again
only
in
the
context
of
whether
a
--
it
is
a
defense
that
there
was
a
court
order
under
which
the
payments
had
been
made.
and
again
we
would
say
there
that
it
is
only
a
defense
in
the
limited
circumstance
where
the
referee
has
been
advised
of
the
priority.
when
he
entered
the
order,
he's
aware
of
the
actual
state
of
affairs
and
where
he
chooses
to
--
the
reasons
best
known
to
himself,
not
to
honor
the
referee
that
is,
not
to
honor
the
government's
priority
and
honoring
his
order,
and
the
united
states
as
i
say,
has
had
notice
and
has
an
opportunity
to
convince
the
referee.
now
the
really
basic
question
that
we
think
that
is
before
the
court
is
the
question
which
is
presented
by
the
question
rather
which
relates
to
the
coverage
of
section
192
itself.
does
section
192
extend
to
fiduciaries
such
as
mr.
king?
now
it's
the
government's
position
stated
that
the
court
below
was
quite
correct
in
rejecting
the
position
as
we
understand
it
of
the
petitioners
that
section
192
does
not
reach
a
court
appointed
fiduciary
unless
he
is
one
of
the
court
appointed
--
types
of
court
appointed
fiduciaries
or
designated
ao
nominee
in
section
192
itself.
now
we
think
that
the
starting
point
in
any
discussion
of
the
reach
of
section
192
must
be
this
court's
consistent
recognition
that
section
192
is
(inaudible)
with
section
191.
as
the
court
is
aware,
both
of
these
sections
date
back
to
the
early
days
of
the
republic
and
manifest
the
firmly
rooted
legislative
interest
in
securing
and
protecting
the
public
revenues.
as
such,
this
court
has
held
that
both
sections
are
to
be
liberally
construed
to
effectuate
their
objectives
not
only
section
191
which
establishes
the
government's
debt
priority
but
also
section
192
which
subjects
to
personal
liability
any
person
who
pays
the
debtor's
debts
in
disregard
of
it.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
if
it
were
held
here
mr.
justice
harlan
that
section
192
does
not
reach
this
class
of
fiduciary,
it
would
leave
the
united
states
without
a
remedy.
and
that
is
one
of
the
appoint
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no,
i
assume
your
honor
that
if
there
was
a
--
if
it
could
be
established
by
the
united
states
that
the
payment
by
mr.
king
to
himself
was
fraudulent,
then
the
united
states
would
have
a
remedy.
but
in
most
of
these
cases,
i
doubt
that
the
question
of
fraud
could
--
the
issue
of
fraud
could
be
established
by
the
united
states.
here
for
example,
there's
no
contest
that
mr.
king
was
a
creditor
of
the
united
states.
the
question
here
as
in
most
of
these
cases
is
whether
or
not
or
--
wasn't
the
absence
of
any
fraud.
the
claim
of
the
united
states
is
going
to
be
satisfied
first
as
the
statute
directs
that
it
shall
be
satisfied
if
it
is
entitled
priority.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
well,
we
would
submit
if
the
court
pleases
that
in
--
that
the
position
that
the
petitioners
take
here
is
that
there
is
an
entire
class
of
fiduciaries,
namely
these
fiduciaries
who
have
court
appointments
and
are
not
designated
ao
nominee
in
192
or
outside
the
reach
of
the
statute.
now
that
would
mean
that
there's
a
whole
class
of
priority
debts
of
united
states
which
have
no
protection
in
the
absence
of
a
--
at
least
of
the
government's
being
able
to
establish
fraud.
now
we
think
that
the
argument
of
the
petitioners
which
does
derives
support
from
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
in
united
states
against
stephens
that
there
is
this
class
of
fiduciaries
who
were
outside
the
ambit
of
the
act
cannot
even
be
squared
with
the
language
of
section
192
even
if
it
were
to
be
assumed
that
this
language
were
to
be
taken
in
a
vacuum
divorced
from
the
legislative
purpose.
section
192
applies
to
every
executor,
administrator,
or
assignee,
or
other
person
who
pays
any
debt
due
by
the
person
or
state
for
whom
or
who
which
he
acts.
now
as
this
court
noted
in
the
bramwell
case,
this
language
is
very
general.
and
it
said
the
generality
of
it
before
any
person
insignificant.
now,
a
receiver
or
distributing
agent
in
this
case
--
in
the
context
of
this
case
mr.
king
is
plainly
a
person
who
pays
the
debts
of
another.
and
in
doing
so,
we
respectfully
submit
he
is
acting
in
the
most
meaningful
sense
for
the
debtor.
mr.
king,
we
would
say
was
acting
clearly
on
behalf
of
the
debtor
corporation
in
paying
its
debts
in
accordance
with
the
plan
of
distribution
which
the
corporation
has
prepared.
now
it's
quite
true
whereas
the
petitioner's
stress
that
in
discharging
their
functions,
a
distributing
agent
or
receiver
as
it
was
involved
in
the
stephens
case,
maybe
an
officer
armed
with
the
court
because
he's
acting
under
a
court
appointment,
and
additionally
is
the
custodian
of
property
which
is
under
the
supervision
of
the
court.
and
we
don't
think
it
follows
that
for
the
purpose
of
section
192
that
a
fiduciary
is
to
be
regarded
as
actig
for
the
court
rather
than
for
the
debtors
merely
because
of
his
status
as
the
court
or
appointee.
and
in
support
of
that
argument,
we
don't
think
we
need
to
go
beyond
the
fact
that
the
administrators
are
designated
ao
nominee
in
section
192
as
being
persons
who
pay
the
debts
of
the
state
for
whom
they
act.
and
of
course,
the
court
well
knows
the
administrator
coming
with
a
--
mr.
king
or
a
receiver
is
an
officer
--
is
appointed
by
the
court
and
as
such
is
an
officer
of
the
court.
apart
from
the
terms
of
the
section,
we
would
say
that
the
construction
that
the
petitioner
offers
cannot
squarely
or
cannot
be
squared
rather
with
the
underlying
legislative
purpose.
i
would
just
point
out
in
that
connection
that
under
this
construction,
there
must
be
imputed
to
congress
on
a
petitioner's
construction
an
intent
to
give
a
higher
dignity
to
the
government's
priority
claims
against
the
proceedings
of
states,
insolvent
proceedings
of
the
states
then
against
as
here
an
insolvent
corporation.
that
follows
from
the
fact
that
where
you
have
an
insolvent
proceedings.
he
invariably
will
have
an
administrator
or
an
executor
who
are
designated
ao
nominee
and
therefore
within
the
reach
of
192.
on
the
other
hand,
as
the
petitioner
views
it,
where
you're
having
insolvent
corporation
anytime
that
the
fiduciary
is
other
than
one
of
the
classes
of
the
fiduciaries
designated
ao
nominee
and
is
in
addition
a
court
appointee,
there's
no
protection
afforded
by
192
at
all.
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
no
your
honor,
on
the
--
we
would
not
think
it
would
make
any
difference.
it
clearly
would
make
no
difference
on
the
first
phase
of
the
case
which
is
whether
section
192
reaches
--
mr.
alan
s.
rosenthal
--
the
class.
now
on
the
second
phase
of
the
case,
that
is
whether
or
not
the
court
approval
provides
immunization
from
liability.
we
would
say
that
that
fact
alone
that
he
had
no
contact
would
make
no
difference.
it
would
still
be
his
duty
we
submit,
to
make
an
inquiry
into
whether
there
are
any
priority
claims.
now
if
there
--
if
we
were
dealing
with
a
distributing
agent
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
corporation,
and
the
corporation
feel
from
him
the
fact
that
there
was
an
actual
or
potential
priority
claim
of
the
united
states
in
the
picture,
then
i
would
suppose
the
distributing
agent,
the
stranger
in
the
position
of
distributing
agent
might
be
relieved
of
liability.
we
would
say
here
that
these
particular
facts
of
this
case
with
this
distributing
agent
who
is
the
president
of
the
debtor
corporation
put
forth
the
plan
of
arrangement,
that
these
merely
reinforced
the
fact
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
there
was
a
breach
of
the
duty
which
was
owed,
the
referee,
in
which
would
owe
the
united
states
on
the
part
of
the
distributing
agent.
for
these
reasons
if
the
court
pleases,
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
