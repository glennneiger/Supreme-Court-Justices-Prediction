mr.
david
s.
bate
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
supreme
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
point
that
petitioners
wish
to
emphasize
on
oral
argument
is
point
number
four
in
the
petitioner's
brief
and
the
only
point
that
is
really
thoroughly
discussed.
mr.
david
s.
bate
yes.
mr.
david
s.
bate
pardon.
the
point
that
the
petitioners
wish
to
emphasize
on
oral
argument
is
point
four
in
the
petitioner's
brief
and
the
only
point
which
the
brief
of
the
united
states
gives
any
emphasis
to
at
all.
the
point
is
that
the
court
below
ordered
mr.
king,
the
distributing
agent
to
distribute
as
he
did.
he
had
no
other
duty
by
his
orders
than
to
distribute
as
he
was
told.
the
government's
claim
was
a
priority
claim
but
it
was
not
liquidated,
it
further
was
disputed
at
the
time
that
the
court
made
its
order
of
distribution.
this
action
is
against
king
as
a
distributing
agent
only.
it
is
not
against
him
in
any
other
capacity.
therefore
this
order
that
we
are
speaking
of
is
the
only
order
that
is
important
that
the
only
--
this
principle
fact
that
is
important.
mr.
king
is
not
being
sued
here
or
charge
in
any
other
capacity.
he
was
obliged
to
and
he
did
follow
orders.
he
is
not
like
therefore
like
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy,
an
executor
and
assignee
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
that
is
one
who
examines
claims
and
advices
the
court
and
then
distributes
as
either
before
--
without
the
court
order
or
as
the
court
directs.
he
certainly
is
not
as
the
trustees
in
bankruptcy,
the
assignees
or
the
executors
that
are
incited
in
the
cases
in
the
government's
brief.
he
is
not
a
person
as
all
those
are
who
has
distributed
either
without
prior
court
order
or
in
--
yes
without
prior
court
order
who
never
--
were
obliged
to
get
a
court
order
at
all.
mr.
david
s.
bate
mr.
justice
harlan,
there
is
no
dispute
at
all
as
to
the
priority.
the
government
had
a
priority
claim.
it
was
unliquidated
and
disputed
at
the
time
that
the
referee
made
his
order.
mr.
david
s.
bate
your
honor,
in
other
words
in
my
preserving
points
one,
two,
and
three
of
the
brief,
is
that
the
--
mr.
david
s.
bate
oh,
well
we
are
saying
that
--
mr.
david
s.
bate
in
the
court
below,
the
applicability
of
191
and
192
as
read
together
were
--
i
think
your
honor
is
referring
to
my
bringing
up
the
insolvency
in
--
of
the
question
of
insolvency
and
the
rest
is
that
we're
--
we
did
not
properly
preserve
them
idle
in
the
court.
mr.
david
s.
bate
i
am
not
arguing
it
here
this
morning.
mr.
david
s.
bate
we've
raised
it
in
our
brief.
your
honor,
the
reason
that
we
raised
this
in
our
brief
and
i
will
address
myself
immediately
to
that.
initially
this
case
was
a
case
of
simple
--
simply
the
case
of
whether
king
should
be
liable
where
he
had
followed
the
orders
of
the
court.
in
the
complaint,
paragraphs
14
and
15
of
the
complaint
say
that
king
distributed
--
he
distributed
a
$160,000
as
distributing
agent.
then
they
go
on
to
say
this
was
in
violation
of
section
192.
in
the
answer
which
the
defendant
made
in
that
case,
we
said
that
king
followed
explicitly
the
orders
of
the
court
and
therefore
shouldn't
be
liable.
on
this
narrow
issue,
we
preceded
to
the
district
court.
in
the
district
court,
we
had
a
stip
--
a
--
well,
first
of
all
we
had
a
pretrial
conference.
then
there
was
a
stipulation
of
fact.
in
both
the
pretrial
conference
and
the
stipulation
of
fact,
the
--
absolutely
the
only
issue
was
whether
king
as
a
distributing
agent
who
distributed
under
orders
of
the
court
was
liable.
we
reached
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals.
we
--
and
the
--
there,
we
--
the
court
found
that
there
--
reversed
judge
wortendyke
in
the
district
court
and
stated
that
that
--
well,
several
things.
first
of
all
they
indicated
that
although
crocker
and
stephens
which
are
the
two
cases
in
conflict.
and
by
reason
of
which
i
believe
this
court
took
cognizance
of
this
case.
they
said
although
in
the
--
the
third
circuit
opinion,
they
said
although
these
cases
are
helpful,
they're
not
determinative.
and
then
they
found
--
they
made
some
statements
such
as
that
there
was
--
that
negligence
in
the
case
at
bar
is
apparent.
then
judge
biggs
who
is
writing
the
opinion
of
the
court,
said
--
made
a
further
statement,
the
equities
are
not
with
king
in
this
case.
it
seemed
to
us
from
this
opinion
that
we
had
gone
entirely
off
the
subject
of
the
initial
district
court
opinion
and
the
findings
of
that
court
as
well
as
the
stipulation
of
facts
as
well
as
the
complaint.
we
felt
that
the
third
circuit
court
was
trying
to
hold
mr.
king
on
some
other
basis
and
possibly
raise
him
from
the
stature
of
a
distributing
agent.
we
--
so
that
at
that
point,
we
went
back
to
the
statutes
and
the
cases
and
dug
into
them
much
more
deeply
and
try
to
read
these
--
the
cases
that
have
been
interpreted
191
and
192.
and
we
did
bring
up
these
other
issues.i
do
not
propose
to
argue
them
here
your
honor
unless
you
wish
me
to.
mr.
david
s.
bate
i
do
not
have
to
rely
on
your
--
your
honor,
no,
i
think
that
what
i
rely
on
for
the
--
we
rely
on
for
the
conclusion
that
we
wish
you
to
make
is
that
king
should
not
be
liable
because
he
was
a
mere
distributing
agent.
mr.
david
s.
bate
that's
the
sole
issue
and
he
followed
precisely
the
orders
of
the
court.
mr.
david
s.
bate
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
s.
bate
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
s.
bate
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
s.
bate
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
s.
bate
the
--
mr.
king
--
that
statement
was
made
by
mr.
freeman
who
was
the
attorney
for
the
debtor
corporation.
mr.
david
s.
bate
mr.
king
was
the
president
of
the
debtor
corporation.
the
--
mr.
david
s.
bate
yes
your
honor.
but
mr.
king
--
there
is
no
--
there
isn't
--
this
case
was
not
tried
on
any
theory
that
mr.
king
was
at
all
responsible
for
that
statement
or
that
that
statement
--
mr.
david
s.
bate
we
--
it
isn't
--
it
is
not
even
known
nor
did
we
allow
it
to
be
stipulated
that
he
was
--
he
heard
the
statement.
he
--
the
only
thing
in
the
court
and
this
is
in
the
record
is
that
he
--
mr.
king
--
there
is
in
the
stipulation
of
fact
that
had
said
that
mr.
king
was
present
in
the
court
on
that
day.
but
there
is
no
--
mr.
david
s.
bate
i
think
it
is
an
inference,
your
honor,
yes.
i
--
but
it
isn't
--
there
is
no
saying
that
that's
--
there
is
nothing
that
--
no
proof
or
no
allegation
that
that
statement
wasn't
true.
in
other
words,
we
went
into
this
on
the
basis
of
what
was
said
in
the
complaint
and
what
was
done
on
this
stipulation.
it
said
in
the
stipulation
of
fact
but
nowhere
was
there
an
allegation
that
what
king
had
done
anything
as
president
of
the
corporation
or
in
any
other
capacity
than
as
distributing
agent,
that
may
--
mr.
david
s.
bate
i
--
your
honor
i'm
--
i
am
not
going
to
--
i
think
that
your
inference
is
absolutely
accurate
that
he
would've
been
there.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
assuming
all
this,
there
is
no
statement
anywhere
that
this
or
no
accusation
that
this
statement
by
king
was
not
absolutely
accurate.
there
is
no
statement
anywhere
in
the
complaint
or
in
the
stipulation
that
this
statement
made
by
mr.
freeman
wasn't
accurate.
he
wasn't
a
very
well
respected
member
of
the
bar
of
the
state
of
new
jersey.
and
a
very
well
accustomed,
this
happened
to
be
the
area
of
his
practice
i
think
mostly.
and
i
am
--
there
is
no
state
--
no
statement,
no
charge
has
been
made
that
this
wasn't
accurate.
this
is
--
mr.
david
s.
bate
we
don't
know
that
but
your
honor
what
we
do
know
is
that
that
--
and
from
this
of
course
an
inference
could
be
drawn
but
we
--
that
--
that's
--
there
wasn't.
we
do
know
that
some
--
that
beside
what
was
left
in
the
$6000
at
the
end
of
the
distribution
which
the
government
took,
there
was
also
some
$6000
received
by
the
united
states
from
the
debtor
corporation.
this
is
stated
in
the
complaint
itself.
but
your
honor
the
point
that
we're
--
that
i'm
trying
to
make
here
is
that
we
were
not
apprised
that
this
was
an
accusation
being
made
against
mr.
king
or
mr.
freeman
that
this
was
a
false
statement.
and
if
it
had
been
so
for
mr.
king
was
alive
when
this
complaint
was
filed,
he
died
shortly
after
the
complaint
was
filed
but
that
would
--
i
think
six
or
eight
months
after
he
died
in
january
of
1959,
i
think
it
was.
but
he
is
--
as
he
was
alive
and
he
could
have
defended
--
we
at
the
time,
the
initial
complaint
was
made.
also
mr.
freeman
was
alive
at
that
time
of
the
stipulation
of
fact.
no
accusation
that
this
statement
of
his
was
false
had
ever
been
made
at
--
he
is
now
deceased
also.
mr.
david
s.
bate
not
the
latter
your
honor.
not
that
--
not
--
oh,
excuse
me,
of
the
$160,000
that
is
accurate,
yes,
alright,
i
--
that
--
that
is
true.
of
the
$160,000
not
enough
was
left
to
pay
the
claim
of
the
united
states.
but
no
statement
was
ever
made
as
to
what
became
of
the
$94,000.
we
were
not
put
on
proof
as
to
what
happened
to
that.
and
if
your
honor
will
note
that
at
the
end
of
the
--
that
this
case
against
us
comes
up
in
1958.
and
the
case
against
the
--
that
--
or
the
point
of
time
that
we're
really
interested
in
is
march
21,
1947,
11
years
has
elapsed.
and
no,
we
were
put
on
no
burden
to
find
out
what
had
happened
to
that
money
in
the
meantime.
mr.
david
s.
bate
yes.
mr.
david
s.
bate
yes
your
honor.
it
does
show
that
and
it
shows
that
he
is
--
he
paid
exactly
in
accordance
with
the
schedules.
the
schedules
or
in
the
schedules
his
two
debt
are
shown.
but
again
as
to
the
responsibility
for
this
--
for
the
schedules
or
--
there
is
no
proof
that
they
were
false
or
in
anyway
wrong
and
this
was
an
unliquidated
claim.
the
--
an
undisputed
claim
and
the
referee
and
mr.
king
and
the
government
undoubtedly
were
depending
on
this
$94,000
that
was
outside.
and
the
referee
went
ahead
and
made
this
order,
and
told
king
to
distribute
and
in
the
--
in
his
distribution,
these
debts
to
king
himself
were
there.
but
i
--
mr.
david
s.
bate
yes
sir.
mr.
david
s.
bate
mr.
freeman,
the
attorney
for
the
debtor
corporation.
mr.
david
s.
bate
and
--
mr.
david
s.
bate
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
he
was
the
attorney
for
mr.
king.
i
don't
really
know.
he
--
mr.
king's
personal
attorney
i
believe
that
--
i
handled
the
statement
to
somebody
in
new
york.
i
don't
know
whether
mr.
king
had.
mr.
freeman
as
his
attorney,
i
don't
know
that.
and
certainly
as
distributing
agent,
he
didn't
need
an
attorney.
as
distributing
agent
and
distributing
agent
as
a
mere
menial
officer
who
is
suppose
to
follow
his
orders
and
do
exactly
as
he's
told.
and
that's
what
mr.
king
did.
he
didn't
need
an
attorney
for
that.
mr.
david
s.
bate
i
would
guess
that
mr.
--
i
surmised
quite
frankly
that
mr.
freeman,
the
attorney
for
the
debtor
corporation
prepared
that
order.
that
would
be
my
guess.
mr.
david
s.
bate
mr.
king
had
been
president
of
the
debtor
corporation,
yes
sir.
mr.
david
s.
bate
yes,
i
have
no
doubt
that
mr.
freeman
and
mr.
king
had
discussed
this
liability.
there's
--
the
--
and
there
were
--
mr.
king
was
the
president
of
the
corporation.
mr.
freeman
was
the
attorney
for
the
debtor
corporation.
mr.
david
s.
bate
the
plan
--
this,
i
don't
know
your
honor.i
really
--
mr.
david
s.
bate
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
s.
bate
yes
and
it's
attached
to
it.
and
the
petitioner,
i
would
assume
would
be
the
corporation
and
i
--
itself.
but
as
to
whether
miss
--
the
work
of
preparing
this
--
mr.
david
s.
bate
no,
he's
--
he
is
certainly
would
--
what
it
seemed
to
be
me
being
not
in
that
position.
but
he
is
not
being
sued
in
any
of
these
other
or
nor
are
any
of
the
acts
that
you
are
speaking
of
here
the
possibility
that
this
--
that
he
neglected
something
in
the
schedules.
these
are
not
--
we
were
not
apprised
of
--
mr.
david
s.
bate
the
liability
of
the
government
was
known
by
him.
of
course,
he
knew
that
he
owed
money
to
pick
(inaudible).
these
are
stated
as
executory
contracts.
but
the
responsibility
was
taken
off
his
shoulders
by
the
referee
because
the
referee
was
told
in
court
--
in
that
colloquy
that
you
were
--
that
has
been
--
that
mr.
justice
goldberg
referred
to.
the
referee
is
told
that
there
is
not
enough
money
in
the
$160,000
to
pay
this
plan.
he
is
told
that
it's
undisputed
--
i
mean
that
is
disputed
by
mr.
--
mr.
freeman
makes
the
statement
that
we're
not
--
we
don't
want
to
allow
this
claim.
and
he
is
told
that
it
--
but
he's
told
that
there
would
be
enough
money
to
take
care
of
the
plan.
mr.
david
s.
bate
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
s.
bate
i
would
assume
that
the
contents
of
the
plan
were
familiar
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
s.
bate
yes
sir.
mr.
david
s.
bate
yes
your
honor
mr.
david
s.
bate
right.
but
the
--
but
in
that
had
been
--
omitted
and
it
was
told
to
the
referee
that
the
--
mr.
david
s.
bate
that
it
had
been
omitted.
mr.
david
s.
bate
so
that
--
mr.
david
s.
bate
our
--
mr.
david
s.
bate
yes
your
honor,
that
is
exactly
what
the
--
our
position
is.
that
the
--
that
he
is
taken
out
of
this
--
the
only
issue
before
us
is
whether
king
as
a
distributing
agent
can
be
liable
but
i
do
feel
that
there
is
involved
here
the
question
of
good
faith
or
bad
faith
but
not
because
it
was
raised
in
the
district
court,
because
it
was
not
raised
there.
there
was
no
--
nothing
from
which
we
knew
that
there
was
a
question
of
bad
faith
or
negligence
in
the
complaint
or
in
the
stipulation
of
fact
or
in
the
district
court's
opinion.
and
judge
wortendyke
in
one
point,
he
cites
in
re
pollak.
now
in
re
pollak
was
a
case
in
which
the
--
judge
wortendyke
said
in
re
pollak
relied
on
by
the
government
is
distinguishable
from
stephens
and
from
the
case
at
bar
because
the
distributing
agent
met
--
in
pollak
made
the
payments
which
depleted
upon
without
proper
court
order.
now
then
came
--
then
he
goes
on
and
say
--
cites
the
other
case
of
--
that
involved
the
distributing
agent.
the
only
other
case
cited
in
the
briefs
and
that
was
in
re
empire
shoe
and
after
that
he
says
that
there
the
agent
was
held
liable
where
he
had
acted
without
fraud.
now
it
seemed
to
me
that
mr.
--
that
judge
wortendyke
if
he
had
thought
there
was
fraud
misrepresentation
or
bad
faith,
or
any
of
these
things
that
are
now
being
brought
up
as
issues,
he
would
have
said
right
there.
he
said
that
--
he
would
have
said
something
to
that
effect
but
he
does
not.
he
negatives
bad
faith.
and
we
had
all
along
been
under
the
impression
that
we
were
dealing
with
a
--
with
the
issue
that
mr.
justice
harlan
has
said
we
were
dealing
with
just
now
which
is
the
simple
issue
of
whether
a
distributing
agent
can
be
liable
where
he
is
--
where
the
referee
knew
all
about
this
thing,
knew
it
was
disputed,
knew
it
was
unliquidated
and
he
knew
that
or
thought
that
was
--
there
was
sufficient
money
to
pay
it
and
there's
no
proof
that
there
wasn't.
he
went
ahead
and
made
the
order.
mr.
david
s.
bate
oh,
i
think
he
took
it
on
faith
but
there
is
no
saying
that
it
wasn't
true.
this
is
the
--
mr.
david
s.
bate
in
1958,
11
years
later,
i
don't
think
mr.
freeman
should
be
liable
when
he
said
at
all
times
--
when
the
government
at
all
times
had
a
right
to
come
in
and
say,
“now,
you
put
up
the
money.”
and
they
never
did.
the
government
--
and
the
government
never
asked
us
to
put
that
money
up.
they
let
us
sit
back
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
all
this
time
and
dispute
this
claim.
i'm
speaking
of
the
--
us,
the
debtor
corporation.
and
dispute
the
claim
through
the
third
circuit
on
the
question
of
whether
of
--
and
up
to
your
court
where
you
denied
certiorari
on
the
question
of
whether
the
government
had
a
right
to
file
its
claim
on
may
9th.
and
it
--
and
the
government
whether
it
was
within
the
category
of
the
people
who
could
file
late
claims
like
that
and
they
decided
yes,
it
was.
but
there
was
--
there
was
a
great
deal
of
litigation
on
this.
and
now
as
mr.
freeman
who's
the
attorney
for
the
debtor
corporation
to
be
held
responsible
for
that.
we
didn't
realize
that
this
was
the
type
of
issue
that
we
were
to
be
faced
with
in
this
court.
mr.
david
s.
bate
mr.
justice
golberg,
i
agree
with
you
and
this
was
what
--
they
did
make
it
an
issue,
and
this
is
what
bothered
us
because
it
had
not
been
an
issue
in
the
court
the
first
instance.
and
here
we
are,
we
have
no
--
mr.
david
s.
bate
absolutely.
mr.
david
s.
bate
your
honor,
i
say
there
--
mr.
david
s.
bate
yes
your
honor
and
i
say
if
we
distribute
--
we
extend
section
192
to
make
such
a
person
as
mr.
king
liable
or
–
then
you
had
placed
a
mere
distributing
agent
on
the
horns
of
the
dilemma.
he's
either
got
to
be
liable
in
contempt
or
he's
got
to
be
liable
under
section
192.
mr.
david
s.
bate
but
this
--
here
the
court
had
already
made
that
decision
your
--
mr.
justice
clark.
i
--
mr.
david
s.
bate
i
don't
think
this
was
pro
format.
that
is
why
in
the
stipulation
of
fact
mr.
murphy
was
so
--
like
pollak
here
was
so
careful
to
put
that
stipulation
that
colloquy
in
because
in
that
colloquy
he
is
told,
the
referee
is
told
exactly
what
the
situation
--
if
something
had
been
hidden
from
him.
if
there
had
been
a
fraud
committed
here
of
some
hiding
then
i
can
understand
your
--
mr.
david
s.
bate
your
honor,
any
person
we
contend
does
not
extend
to
somebody
who
is
a
servant
or
a
servant
of
a
servant
as
in
the
irwing
crest
was
in
the
empire
shoe.
mr.
david
s.
bate
yes
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
david
s.
bate
under
the
orders
of
the
referee
and
the
referee
had
knowledge,
nothing
had
been
hidden
from
the
referee.
mr.
david
s.
bate
your
honor,
could
i
--
mr.
david
s.
bate
if
i
have
time
to
answer
that.
i
think
that
they
are.
they
are
absolutely
relevant.
they
are
the
important
issue
here
but
the
--
what
we
are
saying
is
that
we
were
not
told
that
mr.
king
was
being
accused
for
anything
he
had
done
as
president,
as
make
--
for
making
up
the
schedules
or
in
any
other
capacity
then
as
distributing
agent.
we
--
he
--
and
the
complaint
does
not
tell
us
--
mr.
david
s.
bate
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
s.
bate
yes.
thank
you.
