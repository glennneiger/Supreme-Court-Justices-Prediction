justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
bate,
do
you
really
suggest
that
in
a
chapter
11
proceeding
is
that
the
referee
is
on
the
offensive,
that
he
manages
the
proceeding
or
does
he,
like
another
bankruptcy
proceedings,
wait
for
a
receiver,
a
trustee,
or
a
distributing
agent
to
take
the
steps
indicated
in
the
approved
plan.
and
didn't
he
--
who
for
example
prepared
the
order
for
distribution?
do
you
say
that
king
was
told
the
distributor
in
a
signed
order,
who
prepared
the
order
who
gave
them
and
do
you
think
the
referee
drew
that
themselves?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
mr.
king
had
been
president
of
the
debtor
corporation?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
was
aware
of
the
--
he
was
--
that
he
was
aware,
not
only
the
--
of
the
company's
assets
but
of
its
liabilities
between
the
govern
--
liability
to
the
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
prepared
the
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
came
into
court
with
a
petition
for
chapter
11
with
a
plan
prepared?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
supposed
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
does
mr.
king
is
in
the
position
of
a
neutral
trustee
who
comes
in
as
appointed
by
the
court
and
he
doesn't
have
previous
information
about
the
debtor's
affairs
or
does
not
have
the
prior
information
about
the
contents
of
the
plan.
he's
not
in
that
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
there's
on
his
liability
under
192
because
i
doubt
if
the
government,
i
haven't
heard
the
government,
but
i
doubt
if
the
government
would
suggest
that
he
is
--
that
he
would
be
liable
for
an
unknowing
and
unknowing
payment
of
assets
without
paying
them
the
liability
of
the
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
the
board
of
directors
of
the
company
approved
a
resolution
authorizing
the
company,
the
qualification
under
chapter
11.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
mr.
king
presided
at
that
meeting,
i
assume.
and
i
would
assume
also
though
that
the
content
for
the
plan
is
prepared
for
the
corporation
but
familiar
to
him,
isn't
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
responsibility
is
off
of
his
shoulders
that
--
but
the
responsibility
if
it
became
--
it
went
off
of
his
shoulders
occurred
when
the
referee
approved
the
plan
of
distribution.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
plan
of
distribution
was
prepared
by
the
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
which
he
was
present.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
bate,
i
would
--
i
don't
think
that
maybe
the
labels
like
distributing
agents
may
not
solve
the
case
one
way
or
another.
it
might
be
this
kind
of
distributing
agent
in
one
case
and
another
kind
in
another
case.
the
real
question
even
if
there
was
room
under
192
for
excluding
some
people
and
--
so
that
questions
as
to
what
kind
of
a
distributing
agent
your
--
the
deceased
was
and
what
is
the
knowledge
and
background
and
participation,
and
then
--
very
relevant
question.
and
the
--
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there
was
bad
faith
and
there's
a
long
distance
between
your
knowledge
and
bad
faith.
and
that
i'm
just
suggesting
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
distributing
agent
are
very
relevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly,
answer
the
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
anyone
--
i
didn't
know
anyone
had
suggested
anything
disguise.
and
there's
a
--
suggested
that
he's
liable
under
192.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all.
