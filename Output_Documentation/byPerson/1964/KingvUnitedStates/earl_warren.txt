mr.
bate,
may
i
interrupt
you
just
a
moment
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
say
that
the
orders
of
the
court
has
been
certified
by
the
chief
justice
and
filed
with
the
clerk
would
not
be
(inaudible).
you
may
proceed
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
may
i
ask
if
you
preserve
the
question
with
the
applicability
of
section
191
to
the
present
case
for
review
in
this
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
applicability
of
191,
i
don't
know
just
how
you'll
express
it
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
reason
i
asked
you
is
because
i
understood
that
this
case
was
tried
on
the
theory
below
that
191
did
apply.
now
did
you
preserve
that
issue
for
this
court
or
is
it
raised
here
for
the
first
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
do
you
argue
it
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
raise
it
in
your
brief
though?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
you
have
to
rely
on
them
for
the
conclusion
that
you
ask
us
to
make?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
sole
issue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
said
that
both
the
distributor
and
the
government
relied
on
this
figure,
$94,000.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
made
that
figure?
who
first
presented
that
figure
to
the
court
just
being
after
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
attorney
for
mr.
king
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
distributor?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
was
charged
with
a
--
was
he
charged
with
knowledge
of
that,
that
fact
that
there
wasn't
enough
money
or
was
that
something
that
he
took
on
faith
from
the
distributor's
figures?
chief
justice
earl
warren
right,
but
it
didn't
turn
out
to
be
true?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rosenthal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
it
make
any
difference
in
your
case
if
the
distributor
here
had
no
connection
whatsoever
with
the
company?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
