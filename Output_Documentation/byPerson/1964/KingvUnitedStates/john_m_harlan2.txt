justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
your
real
position
here
was
irrespective
of
whether
king
ior
--
did
or
did
not
know
about
this
claim
of
the
government
as
to
--
he
is
insulated
so
to
speak
because
your
claim
that
he
doesn't
fall
within
one
of
those
categories
or
persons
under
192
and
contrary
wise
i
understood
that
the
government's
position
was
that
irrespective
of
knowledge,
he
is
liable
under
192.
that

because
of
your
case

justice
john

if
you're
--
the
issue
between
--
that
the
issue
between
--
turns
on
whether
king
did
or
did
not
know
or
should've
known
about
this
thing.
and
maybe
you
got
issues
of
fact
in
this
case
that
are
not
--
we
can't
deal
with
on
this
record
and
we're
doing
a
lot
of
speculating
about
this.
but
the
government's
position
is
a
very
straight
forward
one
namely
that
irrespective
of
knowledge
as
i
get
it,
the
distributing
agent
who
in
good
faith
or
bad
faith
pays
out
money
that
with
respect
to
which
the
government
has
priority,
he
is
liable.
and
your
converse
position
is
i
had
assumed
is
that,
that
it
isn't
so
because
the
statute
doesn't
apply
to
the
distributing
agent
but
only
the
person
representatives
of
the
debtor.

supposing
you
were
--
supposing
the
taxpayer's
position
was
accepted
on
the
construction
of
the
statute,
would
that
leave
the
government
without
a
remedy
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
if
he
--
whether
if
you
could
prove
the
--
that
there
was
a
fraudulent
payment
of
this
$42,000
with
full
knowledge
of
the
government's
priority
and
the
pocketing
of
it
by
king?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
view
that
a
remedy?
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
view
of
the
statute
naturally
gives
you
an
easier
case
on
this.
