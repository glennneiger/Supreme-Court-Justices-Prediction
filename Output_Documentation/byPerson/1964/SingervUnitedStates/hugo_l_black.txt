(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
the
argument
--
what
should
be
modified?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
changed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
a
waiver
provided
for
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
you're
saying
that
it's
modified
by
the
sixth
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
different
argument
saying
that
we
ought
to
modify
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
think
due
process
authorizes
you
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
make
the
change,
to
make
the
change.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
would
that
authorize
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
goes
on
the
theory
i
suppose,
they
have
to
admit
that
constitution
makers
didn't
have
a
right
to
say,
“he
had
to
be
tried
exclusively
by
a
jury.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
due
process
clause
as
i
understand
it,
you
would
authorize
us
somehow
to
change
what
they
had
done
on
the
grounds
that
we
didn't
think
it
fitted
due
process.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
try
to
make
activist
out
of
us,
aren't
you,
saying,
we
can
change
the
constitution
by
referring
to
the
due
process
clause.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you've
referred
to
patton
a
number
of
times,
what
was
the
holding
in
patton?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
all
that
was
held.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
clearly
is
not,
quite
a
difference
in
saying
you'll
be
waiving
the
rights
of
11
jurors
and
waiving
the
rights
of
jurors
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
any
of
the
states
though
that
violate
the
state
constitution
to
accept
the
plea
of
guilty
in
a
murder
case,
and
the
jury
fixes
the
verdict,
a
penalty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
they
provide
is,
i
think,
at
least
it's
the
way
it
was
in
my
state
and
i've
tried
a
number
of
them,
where
you
plead
guilty
in
a
capital
case,
you
must
have
the
jury
produce
enough
facts
so
that
the
jury
can
determine
the
facts
of
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
jury
is
not
even
bound
to
by
certain
powers
to
accept
the
recommendation
of
the
prosecutor
as
to
life
instead
of
death
and
still
live
up
to
the
jury.
you
have
to
do
it
even
though
he
pleads
guilty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
practice,
but
you
do
accept
--
they
do
accept
the
plea
of
guilty
under
the
practice
i'm
talking
about.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
wondering
if
there
are
any
states
that
have
held
that
you
cannot
waive
--
you
cannot
plead
guilty
and
thereby
in
the
trial,
to
say
that,
that
ends
the
case,
that,
that
violates
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
directly
followed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
ever
been
directly
followed
in
this
court?
i
know
that
there
were
two
cases
and
this
court
declined
to
reach
it,
but
has
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
they
tried
to
present
it
in
two
cases.
in
one
case,
two
times,
and
this
court
declined
to
reach
it,
but
has
it
ever
been
followed
directly
by
this
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
case
i'm
referring
to
is
the
riddle
versus
dyche,
d
y
c
h
e.
justice
hugo
l.
black
255
u.s.
450
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
this
was
different
--
255.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
wasn't
the
point.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
mentioned
and
the
dissenters
declined
to
say
whether
they
would
follow
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
patton
case
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
except
one
decided,
if
i'm
mistaken
here
--
one
dissenter
said
he
wouldn't
allow
the
waiver.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
concede
then
that
in
there
the
rule
and
all
the
colonies
in
england
at
the
time,
the
constitution
was
adopted
that
the
defendant
could
waive
the
right
to
trial
by
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
right
they
had
in
massachusetts
under
the
massachusetts
law.
