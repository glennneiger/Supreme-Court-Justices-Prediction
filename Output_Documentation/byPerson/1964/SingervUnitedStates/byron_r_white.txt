justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
congress
passed
a
statute
which
required
jury
trial
in
all
criminal
cases
in
the
federal
courts,
you
would
say
that
law
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean
your
answer
is
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
constitution
give
the
constitutional
right
to
the
defendant
to
choose,
to
plead
--
a
right
and
a
choice
that
nobody
can
interfere
with.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible),
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
that
it
would
still
be
here
today
whether
the
fact
had
been
decided
or
not.
you
say
a
fact
hadn't
been
decided,
there
would
only
be
one
mode
of
trial,
the
jury
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
point
is
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
provide
only
one
mode
of
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
would
be
here
though
saying,
“i
don't
need
to
be
tried
by
jury
if
i
don't
want
to”.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
argument
seems
to
me
to
leave
open
the
possibilities
of
the
middle
grounds
that's
in
the
case,
that's
the
--
perhaps
congress
could
or
some
authority
could
require
a
jury
trial
in
every
case,
constitutionally.
but
that
if
it
isn't
going
to
require
a
jury
trial
in
every
case,
the
choice
must
be
left
up
to
the
defendant
rather
than
to
the
prosecutor
or
the
judge.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
also
--
the
court
also
said
in
that
case,
in
the
end
of
it
that
of
course
the
government
and
the
judge
must
dissent
if
it's
going
to
be
waived.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
this
was
a
certified
question
case,
patton
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
part
of
the
facts
stated
in
the
certificate
of
the
question,
had
in
it
the
proposition
that
the
government
consented.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
whenever
you
want
to
talk
about
what
the
holding
of
the
case
was,
it's
pretty
hard
to
say
the
last
one
paragraph
is
a
dictum.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
says
--
it
says
that
--
it
says
that
the
defendant
may
waive
and
there
needn't
be
a
jury
trial
as
long
as
the
government
and
the
prosecution
consent.
