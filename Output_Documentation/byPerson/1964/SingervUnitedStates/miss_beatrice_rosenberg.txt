ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
the
constitutional
validity
of
rule
23
(a),
not
it's
wisdom
is
a
matter
of
policy,
not
the
question
of
whether
it
should
be
changed
for
the
future.
this
rule
was
adopted
by
the
court
and
accepted
by
congress
over
the
suggestion
of
some
people
that
the
order
provide
for
a
waiver
of
a
jury
trial
merely
on
the
face
that
was
extended.
and
it
was
adopted
in
its
present
form
which
says
that
trial
shall
be
by
jury
unless
jury
is
waived
by
the
defendant
with
the
approval
of
a
court
and
the
consent
of
the
government.
so
that
it's
not
what's
a
good
policy
or
what's
a
bad,
but
what
is
constitutionally
required.
in
our
view,
the
constitutional
question
is
not
the
one
which
defendant
has
argued.
his
claim
is
that
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
a
trial
by
the
court
because
this
court
decided
in
patton
that
it
was
possible
to
have
a
valid
tribunal,
if
a
constitution
--
if
a
constitutional
right
to
trial
by
jury
was
waived.
that
was
the
issue
in
patton
phrased
in
terms
of
--
on
the
factual
facts
of
11
jurors,
but
the
court
treated
it
more
broadly.
the
question
was
whether
a
jury
was
part
of
the
structure
of
the
court,
so
that
no
waiver
was
valid.
and
the
fact
that
the
court
decided
that
a
district
court
was
a
valid
court
when
in
fact
without
the
jury,
doesn't
mean
that
the
court
recognized
a
constitutional
right
to
waive
a
jury.
what
the
court
said
was
that
jury
trial
was
primarily,
primarily
for
the
benefit
of
the
defendant,
and
therefore
he
could
waive
it,
and
if
all
parties
and
the
court
agreed,
there
was
a
validly
set
up
court
which
could
try
the
case.
but
the
fact
that
somebody
has
the
right
which
he
may
waive,
doesn't
give
him
a
constitutional
right
to
insist
on
the
opposite.
for
instance,
a
defendant
has
the
right
to
a
public
trial,
a
right
which
may
be
waived.
this
doesn't
mean
that
he
can
insist
on
a
private
trial
whenever
he
wants
it
so
then
nobody
will
ever
hear
about
his
crime.
a
defendant
has
the
right
to
be
confronted
with
the
witnesses
--
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
yes
it's
in
our
brief
your
honor,
page
23.
all
these
illustrations,
i'm
giving
are
cited
there
with
the
cases
that
support
them
and
i
think
some
of
them
are
fairly
self
evident
without
case
citation.
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
the
colby
case.
then,
we
have
a
situation
which
we
also
refer
to,
which
there
is
no
citation
but
i
think
hardly
needs
citation.
a
defendant
has
the
right
to
waive
confrontation
of
witnesses
against
him.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
seriously
contended
that
this
meant
that
he
had
a
right
to
insist
that
the
government
proceed
by
stipulation
before
a
jury
and
never
call
a
live
witness.
a
defendant
has
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial,
a
right
which
he
sometimes
can
waive.
i
don't
think
this
gives
him
the
right
to
insist
that
the
trial
be
put
off
for
ten
years.
a
defendant
has
the
right
to
waive
venue
in
the
district
of
crime,
this
doesn't
mean
that
he
can
insist
that
the
trial
be
held
in
whatever
district
happens
to
suit
his
convenience.
defendant
has
the
right
to
waive
prosecution
by
indictment.
this
doesn't
mean
that
he
can
insist
that
the
government
go
ahead
by
information.
i
think
one
can
go
to
practically
every
one
of
the
guarantees
of
the
sixth
amendment
which
are
for
the
benefit
of
the
defendant
and
show
that
the
right
to
waive
that
under
certain
circumstances
is
not
a
right
to
insist
on
the
opposite.
moreover
i
point
out
that
the
right
to
regulate
the
conditions
under
which
a
defendant
may
waive
the
benefit
of
one
of
the
constitutional
guarantees
has
always
been
deemed
subject
to
regulation
by
congress
or
the
court
through
rule
making
or
decision.
for
example,
many
states
and
in
effect
the
federal
government
provide
that
a
jury
trial
cannot
be
waived
in
the
death
case,
because
under
almost
all
federal
capital
crimes,
the
death
penalty
can
be
assessed
only
by
the
jury,
if
there
were
a
constitutional
right
to
waive
the
jury
trial,
of
course,
those
would
be
invalid.
even
in
lesser
degrees,
the
rules
do
regulate
the
right
to
waive
constitutional
right.
for
instance,
rule
7
of
the
present
rules
provides
that
prosecution
must
be
indictment,
must
be
by
indictment
in
the
death
case
and
this
court
quite
recently
in
the
smith
case
gave
out
what
the
government
regarded
as
a
rather
expansive
reading.
rule
20
provides
that
a
prosecution
may
waive
--
that
a
defendant
may
waive
the
right
to
be
tried
in
the
district
where
the
crime
is
committed
and
plead
guilty
in
the
district
where
he
is
arrested.
but
the
rule
provides
that,
that
must
have
the
consent
of
the
government,
and
as
far
as
i
know
that's
never
been
questioned
as
a
proper
method
of
regulation.
and
that
these
illustrations,
it
seems
to
me
answer
the
suggestion
which
has
been
made
in
the
brief
of
(inaudible),
that
its
beyond
the
rule
making
power
of
this
court
to
set
forth
the
conditions
for
a
waiver.
i
think
these
rules
show
that
conditions
for
a
waiver
had
been
deemed
part
of
the
rule
making
power.
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
the
rules
provide
that
the
court
--
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
the
rules
don't
so
provide
your
honor.
i
think
the
court
--
i
think
congress
and
the
court
could
say
if
it
deemed
such
a
policy
valid.
in
a
case
of
treason
or
a
case
of
death
penalty
in
particular,
we
think
the
matter
should
be
aired
and
that
we
will
not
accept
a
plea
of
guilty.
i
think
the
government
would
have
--
that
the
congress
and
the
court
would
have
that
power.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
bound
to
accept
a
plea
of
guilty
and
of
course
a
judge
may
on
some
circumstances
where
he
finds
that
the
plea,
that
he
--
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
that
he
doesn't
think
it
would
be
in
the
interest
of
justice.
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
i'm
not
talking
about
knowingly
intelligently.
if
he
thinks
that
the
--
he
has
some,
say
so
a
judge
does,
i
don't
think
that
the
government
has
ever
been
recognized
to
have
that
kind
of
a
right.
the
judge
has
some
say
so
as
to
whether
a
man
should
plead
guilty
and
particularly
in
death
cases,
i
don't
think
there'd
be
any
serious
problem
of
the
right
of
congress,
if
itself
is
of
course
desirable,
to
insist
that
the
matter
of
criminality
be
aired
and
be
subjected
to
decision
by
a
jury
and
not
by
a
judge,
and
there
were
great
many
states
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
which
death
cases,
if
they're
tried
at
all,
must
be
by
jury
and
to
the
extent,
if
the
government
wants
to
insist
on
a
death
penalty
in
the
federal
cases
where
only
a
jury
can
assess
a
death
penalty,
the
defendant
doesn't
have
a
right
to
plead
guilty,
because
only
the
jury
--
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
only
the
jury
can
assess
--
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
so,
i
don't
think
its
ever
been
determined,
because
i
don't
think
the
government
has
ever
where
its
taken
a
plea
of
guilty
decided
that
it
wanted
to
ask
for
the
death
penalty.
but
the
penalty
can
be
only
by
a
jury
and
there
was
no
provision
in
the
federal
system
for
a
jury
to
assess
only
damages.
they
are
in
some
states,
but
not
in
the
federal
system,
so
that
i
think
it
would
inevitably
follow.
now,
this
isn't
done,
as
i
say
it's
a
matter
of
practice,
but
i
think
that
it
must
follow,
that
if
a
government
wants
to
insist
on
a
death
penalty,
a
plea
of
guilty
cannot
be
accepted.
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
there
are
number
of
states,
your
honor,
which
do
not
permit
the
waiver
of
a
jury
trial
at
all.
there
are
other
states,
and
it
includes
new
york,
about
which
there's
a
great
deal
of
talk
in
some
of
the
briefs
in
which
jury
trial
may
be
waived
except
in
capital
cases.
there
were
number
of
those.
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
well,
there
are
some
cases
that
--
there
are
some
states
that
provide
that
--
where
a
man
pleads
guilty,
they
must
still
be.
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
that's
so
in
colorado
and
it
is
true
in
washington.
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right,
that's
true
in
washington.
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
think
that
the
--
i
didn't
go
into
that
aspect
but
there
are
a
number
states
--
capital
cases
aren't
treated
separately
in
many
states.
and
there
aren't
many,
i
think
which
are
the
equivalent
of
federal
system,
where
in
effect
you
can
plead
guilty
if
the
capital
offense
is
asked
for
--
if
the
capital
punishment
is
asked
for,
because
only
the
jury
can
assess
punishment.
well,
if
we
are
correct
about
that
and
there
is
no
absolute
right
to
insist
on
a
trial
by
the
court,
as
incidentally
this
court
said
with
respect
to
civil
cases,
very
recently
in
beacon
theatres
case,
said
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
trial
by
a
jury
but
no
constitutional
right
to
a
trial
by
the
court.
then,
the
constitutional
question
in
this
case
comes
down
to
the
question
--
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
which
is
the
statement,
but
it
was
an
indication
of
the
fact
that
the
right
to
waive
doesn't
stem
from
the
constitution.
if
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
waive,
then
the
question
comes
down
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
requirement
of
the
rule
that
a
waiver
of
a
jury
trial
must
be
with
the
consent
of
the
government
and
the
approval
of
the
court.
and
i
point
out
again,
because
the
question
is
power
and
not
policy.
there
may
be,
i
presume
there
are,
considerations
both
ways
as
to
whether
the
government
should
have
a
right
to
insist
on
a
jury
trial
where
a
defendant
wants
to
waive
it.
but
so
long
as
there
are
reasonable
considerations
which
support
the
policy
which
was
deliberately
adapted
in
the
present
rule,
it
seems
to
me
the
validity
of
the
rule
must
be
upheld
and
the
change
if
it
comes,
to
come
in
the
revision
of
the
rule.
now
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
quite
fundamental
concepts
of
our
government
which
support
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
present
rule
and
one
is
the
importance
which
our
system
attaches
to
jury
trial
particularly
in
criminal
cases.
i
take
it
is
the
fundamental
philosophy
that
underlies
that
--
that
12
men
or
really
13,
because
after
all
the
judge
is
never
out
of
the
picture
in
a
jury
case,
are
better
able
to
determine
guilt
than
one.
and
that
on
some
issues
particularly
issues
of
morality
and
intent
that
judgment
of
laymen
may
sometimes
be
better
than
the
judgment
of
a
legally
trained
mind.
there's
also
another
consideration
which
i
think
is
not
given
enough
weight
in
a
lot
of
literature
on
the
subject.
if
you
go
through
our
whole
system
of
government,
it
reflects
the
philosophy
that
unchecked
power
in
one
branch
of
the
government
or
in
one
person
is
not
a
good
thing.
and
one
of
the
very
few
examples
really
in
our
judicial
system
of
the
un-reviewable
power
of
one
man
is
a
power
which
a
judge
has
in
a
criminal
case
and
which
was
recently
reaffirmed
by
this
court
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
now
that
power
becomes
even
greater
when
the
judge
is
not
only
the
presiding
judge
at
the
criminal
trial,
but
is
the
finder
of
fact
as
well.
and
it
is
some
check,
it
isn't
much
of
a
check
but
it
is
some
check,
for
the
government
to
be
able
to
say,
"now,
we
think
this
is
the
kind
of
case
where
we
have
a
right,
we
who
must
do
justice
have
a
right
to
insist
on
the
constitutionally
preferred
method,
one
that
our
system
accepts
as
the
best
method
for
finding
facts,
and
that
is
a
trial
by
jury",
at
least
the
congress
and
this
court
in
the
rule
(inaudible)
could
think
so.
if
--
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
if
you
assume
a
properly
constituted
jury
which
conforms
the
rules
of
this
court
where
there
is
no
reason
for
a
change
of
venue
which
is
another
remedy
that's
open,
i
find
it
hard.
but
i
also
frankly
find
it
hard
to
conceive
of
circumstances
in
an
abstract.
and
therefore,
all
i
can
say
is
this
certainly
isn't
this
kind
of
a
case,
the
case
that
we
were
dealing
with.
we
are
dealing
with
the
kind
of
an
accusation
in
a
setting
in
which
peculiarly,
i
think
the
judgment
of
laymen
of
a
cross-section
of
the
community
is
better
than
the
judgment
of
a
legally
trained
mind.
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
the
government
is
arguing
more
broadly
because
the
rule
is
broader.
all
i
can
say
about
that
kind
of
a
case
and
i
can't
commit
the
government
to
what
may
come
up
that
at
least,
if
a
rule
is
going
to
be
held
invalid,
it
must
be
on
some
such
personalized
special
basis,
that
is
that
the
rule
is
run
broadly
and
we
have
the
right
to
assume
that
the
rule
is
valid
on
the
broad
considerations,
i
have
been
talking
about.
if
in
a
particular
case,
when
it
comes,
there
is
something
peculiar
about
the
circumstances
as
to
that
case
that
makes
the
rule
invalid
as
so
applied,
we
can
deal
with
that
when
it
comes
--
all
i
can
say
is
that
with
the
case
with
which
i
am
dealing,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
which
would
support
that
kind
of
view,
because
the
charge
here
which
is
essentially
a
charge
on
the
simple
mind,
is
a
question
of
playing
on
the
hopes
of
amateur
song
writers
that,
“oh,
if
somebody
will
just
hear
this
song,
they'll
have
a
great
big
hit”,
and
that
sort
of
things
and
it's
very
cleverly
worded.
if
you
look
at
it
carefully
as
a
contract,
nobody
promises
anything,
we
have
the
record
available
for
motion
picture
rights.
now
the
judge
says,
“that
means
exactly
what
it
says,
“it's
available”.
a
jury
looking
at
that
whole
picture
is
better
able
to
judge
the
effect
of
this
whole
lure
what
(inaudible)
called
the
glittering
promise.
this
is
a
kind
of
case
in
which
juries
have
to
be
a
better
judge
than
a
judge.
i
don't
mean
to
imply
we
didn't
have
--
that
the
judge
would
have
been
unfair,
i
am
merely
saying
this
is
a
kind
of
case,
this
kind
of
simple
fraud,
not
complicated,
simple,
where
a
jury
is
assumption
of
our
system
and
i
think
a
valid
one,
that
a
cross
section
of
the
community
is
better
able
to
determine
intent
to
defraud
and
the
ability
to
do
fraud
than
is
the
legally
trained
mind.
but
i've
repeated
again
that
this
isn't
a
good
policy.
it
can
be
changed.
the
fact
is
that
it
was
deliberately
adopted
by
this
court
and
it
seems
to
me
it
cannot
be
held
unconstitutional,
unless
it
could
be
shown
that
it
has
no
basis
in
reason
at
all
and
it
seems
to
me
it
clearly
does
have
a
basis
in
reason.
i
point
out
also
that
congress
has
historically
recognized
that
the
government
is
a
party
to
a
criminal
action,
that
it
has
some
of
the
rights
of
a
party,
and
that
the
government
as
a
party
to
a
criminal
action
has
an
interest
in
the
triar
of
fact.
since
1855,
congress
has
given
the
government
the
right
of
peremptory
challenge,
the
same
as
the
right
of
a
defendant,
peremptory
challenge
a
juror.
i
presume
on
the
basis
that
the
government
ought
to
have
the
same
righteous
dissent
to
see
that
the
case
was
fairly
tried.
and
interestingly
enough,
the
number
of
government
challenges
has
gone
up
over
the
years.
well,
i
think
congress
and
the
court
has
the
constitutional
power
to
say
that
the
government
has
an
interest
in
seeing
that
the
jury
as
a
whole
is
not
in
effect
peremptorily
challenged
by
eliminating
the
jury
entirely.
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
considering
the
place
that
a
jury
trial
occupies
in
our
jurisprudence,
and
considering
the
fact
that
the
government
does
have
an
interest
that
its
case
be
fairly
tried,
it
cannot
be
said
that
this
court
was
without
power
to
decide,
that
if
a
constitutionally
established
method
of
trial
of
a
criminal
case
is
to
be
waived,
the
waiver
must
be
consent
of
the
government
as
well
as
the
approval
of
the
court.
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
particularly,
lately
with
the
pressure
on
to
dispose
of
criminal
case,
it's
very
unusual
as
a
matter
of
fact
not
to
consent
--
i
couldn't
get
any
figure.
but,
the
figures
do
show
that
about
one-third
of
the
cases
now
are
tried
without
a
jury
and
i
think
as
near
as
i
could
find
out
that
the
only
cases
in
which
the
government
has
not
consented
are
the
ones
that
are
before
this
court
now,
either
as
the
--
on
briefs
amicus
or
on
here.
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
the
government
as
--
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
the
government
--
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right,
your
honor.
in
smith
act
cases,
the
government
established
as
a
matter
of
power
that
they
would
not
waive
into
that
case.
to
my
knowledge
it
is
no
longer
that
type
of
thing
now
where
there
is
across
the
board
refusal
to
waive
in
any
one
type
of
case.
i
don't
know
of
any
such
policy,
now
that
was
ten
years
ago
and
it
was
done
without
regard
to
the
personality
of
the
judge,
it
was
a
policy
that
this
type
of
case
ought
to
be
heard
by
the
jury.
and
i
suppose
now
it
can't
be
denied
that
the
chances
are,
that
there
will
be
an
objection
only
when
the
government
feels
that
the
judge
has
a
bias
against
the
prosecution,
either
because
of
the
nature
of
the
case,
or
because
of
the
particular
personality
of
the
judge.
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
you
mean
about
the
11
jurors?
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
your
honor.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there's
a
case
coming
up
now
in
question
about
--
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
oh
i
don't
think
the
issue
has
ever
come
--
has
not
--
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
ah
--
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
meant
--
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
that
was
before
patton,
patton
was
in
281.
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
that
was
before
patton.
patton
was
in
281
united
states.
i
don't
--
the
only
time
that
this
court
has
dealt
with
the
patton
case
directly
is
in
adams
ex
rel,
mccann.
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
no
that
wasn't
the
point.
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right,
i
don't
think
--
now
of
course
the
court
has
--
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
justice
murphy
said
he
wouldn't
allow.
i
don't
think
it
has
come
up
in
that
sense,
the
court
has
never
been
asked
to
decide
the
validity
of
trial
of
the
waiver
of
a
jury
trial
again.
it
has
been
assumed
there
have
been
--
i'm
trying
to
think
whether
any
other
cases
that
came
before
this
court
involved
in
fact
a
waiver
of
a
jury
trial.
i
don't
think
it's
been
challenged
the
right
to
waive,
that
is
neither
defendants
nor
the
government
has
--
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
have
accepted
patton
as
setting
forth
the
rule
that
you
can
have
a
competent
tribunal
on
the
waiver
of
a
jury
trial,
so
that
in
that
sense
it
hasn't
been
challenged
either
by
defendants
or
the
government.
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
as
i
understand
that
case
if
you
--
i
don't
think
we
have
the
record
here.
the
government
said
they
wouldn't
consent
and
then
the
motion
was
renewed
at
the
trial.
and
it
is
my
understanding
that
this
represents
primarily
the
decision
of
the
judge.
the
judge
then
said,
“i
will
disallow
your
motion”.
now,
i
must
say
that
the
government
in
stating
his
motion,
the
defendant
did
say
that
the
government
had
withheld
consent.
but
the
court
said
in
the
record,
i
will
deny
your
motion,
we
have
here
issues
of
intent
and
--
oh
something
else,
which
i
think
should
be
tried
by
the
jury,
so
that
there
was
at
the
very
least
participation
by
the
court
in
that
determination.
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
it
dwells
from
i
think
the
argument
i
made
that
when
the
constitution
granted
a
right
to
a
jury
trial,
it
didn't
grant
the
right
to
a
trial
by
the
court,
so
that
there
was
no
reserved
right
to
a
trial
by
the
court.
and
may
i
say
that
those
historical
materials
which
--
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
you
will
find
if
we
read
dean
griswold's
article
which
was
part
of
the
government's
brief
in
patton
and
incidentally
as
he
says
in
this
argument,
the
court
didn't
bother
to
reach,
decided
it
on
other
grounds
in
patton,
that
all
it
really
amounts
to
is
a
statement
that
there
is
--
there
is
historical
basis
for
the
conclusion
in
patton
that
it
was
--
you
had
a
competent
tribunal.
for
example,
some
of
the
cases,
a
waiver
of
a
jury
trial
come
from
massachusetts,
massachusetts
had
a
1621
statute
which
said
that
there
was
a
right
to
waive
a
jury
trial,
and
the
other
--
so
that
the
most
that
can
be
said
about
this
material
is
that
it
furnishes
some
historical
support
where
the
patton
decision
to
be
have
said,
that
where
there
has
been
a
waiver
of
a
jury
trial,
there
is
a
competent
tribunal,
it
doesn't
establish
a
right.
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
all
i
said
was
at
the
most
it
does
is
furnish
some
historical
support
and
one
will
find
that
the
greatest
historical
support
which
is
in
massachusetts
came
from
a
statute
so
that
there
was
in
massachusetts
a
--
what's
called
a
statute
of
liberties
which
did
incorporate
a
right
to
waive
a
trial.
ms.
miss
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
