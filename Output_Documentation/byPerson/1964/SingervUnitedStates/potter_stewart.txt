justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
think
--
the
argument
is
that
it
needs
a
fair
trial
just
as
you
do.
justice
potter
stewart
and
not
that
it
needs
an
edge
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
you're
asking
for
an
edge.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
is
not
an
ideal
world
and
there
are
judges
who
are
--
who
don't
behave
like
joe.
there
are
trial
judges
who
have
the
reputation
of
having
preconceptions
about
a
certain
type
of
a
person
or
a
certain
type
of
crime.
some
judges
are
notoriously
lenient
on
tax
evaders,
criminal
tax
evaders,
for
example.
we
all
know
that,
that'
a
fact
of
life.
justice
potter
stewart
others
are
very
--
are
notoriously
tough
on
certain
kinds
of
criminals
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
because
that's
explicitly
in
the
constitution,
that's
why.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that,
have
you
gotten
authority
for
that?
justice
potter
stewart
now
one
citation
here
is
of
a
dissenting
opinion,
i
notice
on
page
12.
justice
potter
stewart
if
a
defendant
waives
the
whole
works
of
the
bill
of
rights,
and
says,
“i
plead
guilty”,
can't
he
insist
then
that
there
be
no
trial
at
all,
does
the
government
then
have
a
right
to
put
on
witnesses
and
all
these
things?
justice
potter
stewart
he
says,
“i
plead
guilty”.
then
can
the
government
insist
on
having
a
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
not
knowingly
and
intelligently
made.
i'm
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that's
true
under
for
example
the
so
called
lindbergh
act,
where
bodily
harm
has
been
inflicted
on
the
victim,
allegedly
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
the
effect
of
that,
that
the
defendant
cannot
plead
guilty?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
justice
black
asked
you
about
pleading
guilty
in
other
states.
justice
potter
stewart
nobody
was
trying
to
waive
any
of
the
jury
in
the
beacon
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well
miss
rosenberg
this,
to
my
own
knowledge,
is
to
arise
a
decade
or
so
ago
in
the
smith
act
prosecution.
justice
potter
stewart
question,
and
the
government
insisted
on
a
jury
trial
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
defendant
insisted
that
he
couldn't
get
a
fair
trial
from
the
jury
--
