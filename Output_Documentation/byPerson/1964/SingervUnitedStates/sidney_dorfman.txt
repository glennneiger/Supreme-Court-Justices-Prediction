mr.
sidney
dorfman
mr.
chief
justice,
may,
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
below
was
indicted
for
alleged
mail
fraud
in
connection
with
the
conduct
of
his
music
publishing
business.
twice
in
the
lower
court,
he
attempted
to
waive
trial
by
a
jury.
in
each
instance,
the
government
refused
to
exceed
to
a
waiver
of
trial
by
a
jury
although
the
learned
united
states
district
judge
indicated
that
he
was
willing
to
try
the
case
without
a
jury.
parenthetically,
judge
yankwich
who
tried
the
case
stated
and
it
is
in
the
record
at
page
29,
that
he
did
not
believe
that
23(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
was
constitutional
insofar
as
it
deprived
the
defendant
of
the
right
to
waive
trial
by
a
jury.
accordingly,
a
jury
was
empanelled,
it
tried
the
defendant
over
a
two-week
period,
and
convicted
him
on
29
of
the
30
counts.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
judge
yankwich
indicated
that
he
felt
bound
by
rule
23(a).
he
felt
that
23
(a)
was
an
unconstitutional
rule.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
judge
yankwich
felt,
i
suppose
a
great
respect
for
rule
23(a)
having
been
promulgated
by
this
court
in
1946,
and
didn't
feel
disposed
to
overrule
it
himself
on
that
level.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
at
the
bottom
of
page
29,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
the
judge
said
at
the
court,
“the
government
of
course
does
not
have
to
waive.
i
have
always
questioned
the
constitutionality
of
that
provision
of
the
supreme
court
ruling
saying
that
the
government
must
consent
to
waiver
of
jury
trial.
the
government
is
not
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
the
defendant
did
grant
of
a
jury
trial.
i
always
questioned
it
but
i
do
not
want
to
be
the
first
judge
in
the
united
states
to
raise
the
point”.
we
took
an
appeal
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
ninth
circuit
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
the
conviction
stating
inter
alia,
that
although
the
points
that
were
raised
concerning
23
(a)
were
not
without
some
persuasive
quality.
they
were
not
sufficiently
persuasive
apparently
to
overrule
23
(a)
on
that
level.
in
oral
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals,
judge
barnes
suggested
that
i
bring
the
matter
here
to
test
the
constitutionality
of
23
(a)
and
after
the
judgment
was
affirmed,
i
petitioned
this
honorable
court
for
certiorari
which
fortunately
was
granted
and
that
is
how
we
are
here
today.
the
square
issue
before
the
court
is
of
course
the
validity
of
23
(a)
insofar
as
it
purports
to
require
the
consent
of
the
government
before
the
defendant
can
waive
a
jury
trial.
stated
in
other
way,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
defendant
has
a
constitutional
right
to
be
tried
by
the
court
and
not
by
the
jury.
stated
still
another
way,
the
question
and
it's
the
same
question
is,
does
the
united
states
of
america
have
a
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
a
federal
felony
case.
stated
still
another
way
and
still
the
same
question
is
can
the
government
block
a
free
and
intelligent,
involuntary
choice
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
and
his
counsel,
particularly
where
the
court
consents,
can
the
government
block
arbitrarily
the
defendant's
insistence
upon
trial
by
the
court
and
upon
waiver
of
the
jury.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
i
expect
that
i
would
be
confronted
with
that
question,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
and
the
question
i've
imagined
really
is,
“am
i
consistent
in
my
position
that
neither
the
judge
nor
the
government
has
anything
to
say
about
the
defendant's
waiver
of
a
jury
trial?”
and
i
would
say
that
my
position
is
this,
that
except
in
the
egregious
case,
where
a
defendant
obviously
is
not
making
an
intelligent
choice
or
his
counsel
is
not
paying
attention
to
his
duties
as
counsel
and
something
is
going
so
badly
that
it
would
be
an
error
and
reversible,
not
to
step
in,
then
the
court
has
nothing
to
say
about
it.
the
judge
has
nothing
more
to
say
about
that
choice
than
he
has
to
say
about
the
defendant's
right
to
take
the
fifth
amendment,
than
he
has
to
say
about
the
defendant's
right
to
plead
guilty
or
not
guilty,
than
he
has
to
say
about
any
of
the
procedural
steps
except
in
the
exercise
of
a
sound
judicial
discretion
to
protect
the
defendant
where
he
obviously
is
not
protecting
himself
or
his
counsel
is
not
protecting
him.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
i
would
say
it
would
be
unconstitutional
since
patton
versus
the
united
states.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
my
answer
is
yes.
yes.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
definitely.
that
is
the
position
of
the
petitioner
and
i
would
like
to
develop
that
position
--
mr.
sidney
dorfman
it
has
to
be,
yes,
your
honor,
in
this.
now,
how
do
we
come
to
this
position?
i
think
we
come
to
it
on
historical
basis,
on
a
logical
basis,
on
a
basis
of
the
construction
of
the
words
of
the
constitution,
and
on
the
basis
of
everyday,
ordinary,
practical
common
sense
and
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
as
far
as
the
historical
basis
is
concerned,
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
although
the
history
of
the
jury
system
is
shrouded
in
mist,
its
origins
are
unknown,
much
of
its
development
is
still
undetermined
by
whatever
scholarship
has
turned
its
attention
to
this
problem
over
centuries.
still
there
are
certain
things
that
we
do
know
about
the
jury
system
and
one
of
the
most
important
insofar
as
this
case
is
concerned
is
that
the
jury
system
was
a
‘johnny
come
lately'
that
the
jury
system
was
an
outgrowth
of
other
systems,
that
the
jury
system
was
not
the
original
mode
of
determining
matters
in
judicial
bodies.
there
were
other
techniques
--
other
ways
of
trying
cases
before
the
jury
system
developed,
either
by
germanic
counsels
of
the
elders
in
the
local
area
or
by
trial
by
battle
or
by
trial
by
ordeal
or
by
trial
by
compurgators,
trial
by
witnesses,
all
kinds
and
varieties
of
techniques.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
you
do
have
to
go
way
back,
your
honor,
but
i
think
i
can
also
travel
that
distance
right
up
to
the
date
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
and
trace
the
course
of
it
briefly
because
we
have
that
much
time
and
also
scholarship
is
limited.
but,
there
were
ancient
ways
of
trying
cases
upon
which
the
jury
system
was
engrafted,
so
that
there
were
rights
that
were
accorded
to
people
with
respect
to
trials
that
were
other
than
jury
system
rights.
and
when
the
jury
system
finally
came
into
play,
it
existed
conterminously
with
these
other
techniques.
there
was
a
right
to
be
tried
by
a
jury
and
there
was
a
right
to
be
tried
by
battle.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
wasn't
until
1819,
that
the
right
to
plead
for
trial
by
battle
in
england
in
murder
and
treason
cases
was
abolished.
in
the
case
of
ashford
versus
thornton,
1
barnwell
and
alderson
405,
in
1819,
it
was
decided
by
the
high
court
of
england
that
the
defendant
who
pleaded
the
right
to
be
tried
by
battle
in
a
felony
murder
case
had
pleaded
a
constitutional
right,
the
parliament
immediately
abolished
it
within
a
few
months
but
it
was
still
on
the
books.
and
the
point
of
this
is
to
show
the
existence
of
alternative
methods
and
that
common
law,
we're
all
familiar
with
the
doctrine
of
forcing
a
plea
by
paying
a
voir
dire
by
some
form
of
torture
when
the
defendant
refused
to
plead
or
as
is
more
pertinent
to
the
case
before
the
court
here.
when
the
defendant
refused
to
specify
whether
he
wished
to
be
tried
by
means
of
a
jury
or
by
means
of
trial
by
battle
or
by
means
of
trial
by
ordeal,
they
piled
iron
weights
on
him
until
he
either
specified
or
died.
the
importance
of
that
doctrine
--
the
significance
of
it,
however,
is
that
the
choice
was
the
defendant's.
it
wasn't
the
kings,
it
wasn't
the
crown
--
the
crown
couldn't
say
to
him,
“i
will
tell
you
what
your
plea
is
going
to
be”.
the
medieval
mind
required
him
to
choose
whether
he
wanted
to
be
tried
by
ordeal
or
by
a
jury
or
by
some
other
technique
or
method.
in
colonial
days,
and
the
lesson
of
the
colonial
days,
is
of
course
taught
to
us
by
the
brief
of
the
government
in
united
states
versus
patton,
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold,
who
is
now
dean
of
the
harvard
law
school
was
a
counsel
for
the
government
in
united
states
versus
patton
and
he
wrote
much
of
the
brief
dealing
with
the
history
of
the
jury
system
and
the
right
to
waive
jury
trials
during
the
colonial
days.
in
20
virginia
law
review
in
1934,
four
years
after
the
patton
case
was
decided,
he
elaborated
on
his
brief
in
united
states
versus
patton
and
he
took
the
position
in
the
patton
case,
which
the
government
of
course,
urged
very
strongly,
that
there
was
a
right
to
waive
a
trial
by
jury
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution.
there
weren't
a
great
many
cases
in
colonial
days
but
mr.
griswold
explains
that
on
the
basis
of
the
paucity
of
the
record,
there
weren't
enough
reported
cases
to
give
a
clear
picture
of
how
prevalent
the
doctrine
of
the
waiver
of
trial
by
jury
really
was.
but,
it
was
his
opinion
and
it
was
the
government's
argument
to
this
court
in
patton
versus
the
united
states
that
the
reason
that
article
iii
section
2
clause
3
of
the
united
states
constitution
does
not
mean
what
it
says
when
it
says
that
all
trial
shall
be
it
by
jury,
is
that
at
the
time
that
constitution
was
adopted,
it
was
well
known
that
there
were
alternative
methods
of
trial
and
that
the
doctrine
set
forth
in
article
iii
section
2
clause
3
and
in
the
sixth
amendment
of
trial
by
jury
was
an
optional
doctrine,
optional
with
the
defendant.
mr.
griswold
and
the
brief
for
the
government
in
patton
versus
the
united
states
cites
the
pennsylvania
case,
in
the
year
1685,
proprietor
versus
wilkins,
it's
in
the
pennypacker's
colonial
cases
at
page
88,
it's
also
cited
in
the
report
of
patton
versus
u.s.
and
that
was
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
was
accused
of
a
felony
and
he
came
before
the
pennsylvania
court
and
he
said
that
he
wanted
to
be
tried
without
a
jury
and
that
counsel
for
the
government
said,
“this
cannot
be,
you
must
have
a
jury
trial”
and
the
court
overruled
him
and
held
that
it
was
permissible
to
waive
trial
by
jury
and
jury
was
waived
and
he
was
convicted.
but
the
point
is
established
according
to
the
government
brief
in
patton
versus
the
united
states
that
there
was
a
right
to
waive
trial
by
jury,
so
that
if
you
review
the
history
of
this
thing,
you
find
that
the
jury
system
was
an
outgrowth
of
other
modes
of
trial
which
have
existed
right
past
the
acceptance
or
the
adoption
of
the
constitution.
you
find
that
the
choice
was
the
choice
of
the
defendant.
you
find
that
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
it
was
recognized
in
the
cases
that
you
could
have
an
alternative
method
and
if
you
then
turn
your
attention
to
the
ninth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution,
you'll
find
that
the
enumeration
certain
rights
such
as
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
shall
not
derogate
or
diminish
or
lessen
the
other
rights
of
the
citizens
that
are
not
enumerated
in
the
constitution
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
one
of
the
rights
that
the
citizens
have
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
was
the
right
to
waive
a
jury,
the
right
to
be
tried
by
the
court
alone.
now,
we
turn
to
the
alternative
problem.
what
right
does
the
government
have
to
insist
upon
a
trial
by
jury?
if
you
look
at
this
thing
historically,
the
battle
has
not
yet
been
fought
in
which
the
government
won
the
right
to
interpose
between
the
crown
and
the
crown's
prosecutor
and
the
crown's
judge,
a
jury
of
12
good
men
in
troop.
there
never
was
a
situation
in
political
history
in
which
a
king
or
a
group
of
kings
felt
themselves
threaten
to
such
an
extent
by
the
powerful
defendants
who
were
indicted
in
criminal
cases,
that
they
need
--
that
the
king
needed
a
jury
to
protect
the
justice
of
the
state.
there
never
was
such
a
trend
in
political
history.
it
was
always
exactly
the
opposite.
it
was
always
the
situation
in
which
the
weak
defendant
terrified
that
the
power
of
the
crown
fought
for
and
won
the
right
to
the
interposition
of
the
jury
against
the
power
of
the
state.
secondly,
there
isn't
a
word
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
that
grants
or
hints
at
or
intimates
that
the
government
has
a
right
to
a
trial
by
jury,
not
--
mr.
sidney
dorfman
article
iii
section
2,
you
mean
before
patton
versus
united
states,
your
honor,
or
after?
mr.
sidney
dorfman
well,
the
constitutional
language
says
that
all
trials
shall
be
by
jury.
but,
patton
versus
the
united
states
says
that
this
means
unless
it's
waived.
as
soon
as
the
government
pressed
for
an
affirmance
of
the
conviction
in
patton
versus
the
united
states,
it
opened
the
door
to
this
question,
if
patton
versus
the
united
states
had
not
been
decided,
we
would
not
be
here
today
because
there
would
only
be
trial
by
jury
in
felony
cases.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
yes,
the
sixth
is
--
mr.
sidney
dorfman
well,
and
that
was
the
court
did
in
patton
versus
united
states.
you're
quite
right,
your
honor.
it
reconciled
article
iii
in
favor
of
the
language
of
the
sixth
amendment
making
it
an
optional
right
to
be
enjoyed
by
the
defendant.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
that's
right.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
well,
we
wouldn't
be
here
on
23
(a),
we
would
probably
be
here
on
--
mr.
sidney
dorfman
probably,
it
would
be
urging
that
it
should
be
modified.
but
one
of
the
discrepancies
of
course
--
one
--
mr.
sidney
dorfman
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
probably
that
the
article
--
the
language,
the
positive,
unconditional
language
of
article
iii
section
2
clause
3
which
says
that
all
trials,
all
crimes
shall
be
tried
by
jury
is
too
strong,
that
there
is
a
method
of
waiver
because
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
points
out
the
sixth
amendment
does
couch
that
same
protection
in
terms
of
an
enjoinment
of
a
right
by
the
defendant.
and
i
think
that
there
is
no
question
that
it
should
be
modified
in
terms
of
waivability.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
changed,
well
--
mr.
sidney
dorfman
by
constitutional
amendment?
mr.
sidney
dorfman
of
course,
patton
versus
the
united
states
gave
us
an
easier
way.
patton
versus
the
united
states
said
that
the
article
iii
section
2
is
and
was
intended
to
be
modified
in
the
light
of
the
sixth
amendment.
to
me,
that
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
yes.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
well,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
court
has
done
anything
except
interpret
the
constitution
correctly.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
fifth
amendment.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
due
process
clause,
the
fifth
amendment,
the
ninth
amendment,
the
tenth
amendment,
the
sixth
amendment
--
those
groups,
that
group
of
amendments.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor,
i'm
caught
in
the
crossfire.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
i
bring
in
the
ninth
amendment
this
way.
the
ninth
amendment
--
mr.
sidney
dorfman
yes,
yes.
but,
the
ninth
amendment
does
say
that
the
enumeration
of
certain
rights
in
the
constitution
shall
not
be
deemed
to
disparage
or
diminish
other
rights
which
are
reserved
to
the
people.
i
take
the
position
of
the
right
to
trial
by
the
court
was
a
right
of
the
people
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
and
the
fact
that
you
have
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
expressed
and
gives
way
to
the
latin
maxim
of
expressio
unius
inclusio
alterius,
except
for
the
ninth
amendment.
the
ninth
amendment
preserves
the
other
rights.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
i
think
that
if
the
people
--
mr.
sidney
dorfman
how
would
the
due
process
clause
authorize
--
mr.
sidney
dorfman
well,
i
think
that
if
part
of
our
system
of
trial,
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
and
thereafter
was
to
include
a
right
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
to
choose
whether
to
be
tried
by
a
jury
or
by
the
court
alone.
to
take
that
choice
away
from
him
is
more
than
to
take
away
a
procedural
right
from
him,
is
to
take
away
a
substantive
right
from
him.
and
when
you
take
away
a
substantive
right
from
a
citizen,
you
violate
the
due
process
clause,
and
that's
why
i
think
that
23
(a)
--
mr.
sidney
dorfman
i
feel
that
they
did
--
well,
the
constitution
makers
of
course
probably
had
a
right
to
do
anything
they
like,
when
you
make
a
constitution,
i
imagine
you
act
de
novo.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
constitution
properly
interpreted
and
as
this
court
has
interpreted
it
in
patton
versus
the
united
states
and
in
adams
versus
the
united
states
ex
rel,
mccann
in
a
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
which
he
also
permitted
--
or
the
court
permitted
mr.
justice
frankfurter
writing
the
opinion,
permitted
a
defendant
to
waive
a
jury
trial
without
the
assistance
of
counsel
indicates
that
the
constitution
does
permit
waiver.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
the
last
thing
in
the
world
that
i
would
ever
attempt
to
do
would
be
to
make
an
activist
or
a
passivist
out
of
any
member
of
this
court,
your
honor.
all
that
i
am
trying
to
do
is
to
help
in
whatever
little
way
i
can
to
guide
the
court
along
the
lines
which
it
itself
laid
down
in
the
patton
case
at
the
behest
of
the
government
who
was
there
seeking
the
conviction
and
got
it,
and
to
direct
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
somewhat
anomalous
position
of
the
government
here
today
when
they
sound
in
their
brief
as
though
they
were
writing
a
brief
for
the
defendant
in
the
patton
case,
extolling
the
virtues
of
the
jury
trial
now
because
they
can
gain
a
conviction
by
doing
so.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
the
argument
on
the
ninth
amendment,
yes
your
honor.
the
amendment
nine
as
i
read
it,
and
i
think
i
read
it
correctly,
provides
that
the
enumeration
in
the
constitution
of
certain
rights
shall
not
be
construed
to
deny
or
disparage
others
retained
by
the
people.
it
is
my
position,
based
upon
the
research
done
by
the
government
in
patton
versus
the
united
states
that
at
a
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
people
had
alternative
rights
with
respect
to
trial
in
felony
cases,
one
right
was
to
be
tried
by
a
jury,
one
right
was
to
be
tried
by
the
court.
when
the
constitution
pinpointed
the
right
to
be
tried
by
a
jury,
they
did
not
thereby,
imply
that
you
have
lost
your
constitutional
right
to
be
tried
by
the
court.
the
purpose
of
the
ninth
amendment
is
to
preserve
to
the
people
their
rights
despite
the
failure
of
the
constitution
to
specify
any
particular
right.
if
the
right
existed
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
the
failure
of
the
constitution
to
mention
it
does
not
abrogate
that
right.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
i
would
think
it's
a
restraint
on
the
states
as
well.
i
would
think
so,
because
the
rights
of
the
people
pass
beyond
the
state
lines.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
no,
your
honor.
if
the
constitution
positively,
clearly
either
by
its
own
terms
or
as
interpreted
by
this
honorable
court
have
removed
from
the
people
certain
of
their
constitutional
rights
--
certain
of
their
common
law
rights,
the
constitution
controls
and
those
rights
are
gone.
but
where
the
constitution
does
not
do
so,
a
right
that
the
people
had
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
remains.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
address
the
court
briefly
on
the
question
of
the
practical
considerations
that
are
involved
in
this
issue
of
the
government's
vetoing
the
defendant's
right
to
a
jury
trial.
the
jury
system
is
commonly
described
as
a
shield
for
the
protection
of
the
defendants.
and
i
think
that
it's
a
truism
to
remark
that
many
people
fight
better
without
shields
in
certain
kinds
of
cases
and
it
is
unthinkable
for
the
adversary
to
be
able
to
prescribe
the
particular
armament
that
a
combatant
is
to
wear
in
a
particular
controversy.
there
are
cases
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
in
adams
versus
the
united
states
ex
rel.
mccann
in
which
it
is
better
for
the
defendant
to
be
able
to
waive
a
jury.
there
are
cases
such
as
issues
involving
great
political
problems
such
as
accusations
of
communism,
accusations
of
treason.
there
are
problems
that
face
the
country
and
the
courts
today
in
the
south,
where
a
defendant
be
he
from
the
north
or
from
the
south
may
well
feel
that
the
choice
of
being
tried
by
a
jury
or
by
a
judge
alone
is
vital
to
the
kind
of
defense
that
he
can
make
out
for
the
government
to
be
able
to
say
that
we
shall
have
the
right
to
veto
your
choice.
under
23
(a),
we
have
that
right,
to
veto
your
choice,
to
me
seems
to
be
unthinkable.
it
seems
that
the
arguments
in
the
government's
or
the
solicitor
general's
brief
to
the
effect
that
it
is
sometimes
important
for
the
government
to
be
able
to
choose
a
jury
because
of
some
difficulties
it
may
be
having
or
fancies
it
may
have
with
the
particular
judge
is
an
unthinkable
kind
of
an
argument
for
the
government
to
urge.
when
the
government
speaks,
when
the
government
investigates,
indicts,
and
prosecutes
one
of
its
citizens,
it
should
speak
like
joe
from
olympus.
it
should
speak
with
a
voice
that
can
be
heard
by
a
judge,
a
federal
judge
as
well
as
by
a
jury
for
the
government
to
say
that
there
are
cases
when
we
need
an
edge,
when
we
have
to
be
able
to
choose
as
to
whether
or
not
there's
going
to
be
a
judge
or
a
jury
seems
unconscionable
because
the
tremendous
weight
that
the
government
already
has,
the
tremendous
edge
that
it
already
possesses
is
more
than
enough.
the
investigative
powers
of
the
fbi,
the
batteries
of
lawyers,
the
almost
unlimited
funds
with
which
to
investigate
and
prosecute
criminal
cases.
when
you
balance
this
tremendous
and
awesome
power
of
the
greatest
country
in
the
world,
focused
upon
one
of
its
citizens
to
give
--
for
the
government
to
say
that
it
needs
an
edge
is
absolutely
unthinkable.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
the
government
--
mr.
sidney
dorfman
well
--
mr.
sidney
dorfman
the
solicitor
general's
brief
does
indicate
that
there
are
cases
where
it
would
like
to
have
a
jury
rather
than
a
judge.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
yes.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
but
the
argument
that
the
defendants
make
in
response
to
that
observation
and
it
is
an
accurate
observation,
but
the
argument
that
the
defendant
make
is
this,
there
is
no
question
that
when
the
defendant
says
he
wants
a
jury
trial,
when
he
exercises
his
constitutional
right
to
have
a
jury
trial,
your
honor's
argument
--
in
the
mouth
of
the
government
has
no
effect.
when
the
government
would
like
to
have
trial
by
a
judge
and
not
by
a
jury,
when
the
defendant
says,
“i
want
trial
by
a
jury”,
there's
nothing
that
the
government
can
do
about
it.
now,
why?
mr.
sidney
dorfman
in
the
constitution,
right.
and
i
urge
the
court
that
there
should
be
no
difference
when
the
defendant
says,
“i
want
a
trial
by
the
court
alone”,
with
respect
to
what
the
government
has
to
say
about
it,
then
there
is
with
respect
to
the
situation
when
the
defendant
says,
“i
want
trial
by
the
jury”.
of
course
it
a
real
world
in
which
we
live
and
there
are
certainly
a
number
of
cases
but
not
a
great
many
because
in
the
vast
majority
of
the
cases
your
honor,
in
the
great
majority
of
the
cases,
the
government
is
very
to
happy
to
waive
a
jury.
in
the
great
majority
of
the
cases,
it
wants
trial
by
the
judge
because
the
government
recognizes
that
the
jury
is
the
last
bulwark,
the
one
instrument
to
which
the
defendant
can
appeal
to
free
him,
irrespective
of
the
law
or
the
facts.
so
that
this
problem
arises
insofar
as
protection
for
the
government
is
concerned
only
in
a
very
few
cases,
i
see
that
my
time
is
running
out,
if
there
were
any
time
--
mr.
sidney
dorfman
i
will
certainly
accept
the
latter
part
of
that
proposition
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure
about
the
first
part
of
that,
in
the
light
of
the
present
situation
since
patton
versus
the
united
states.
but
--
mr.
sidney
dorfman
here
was
the
holding
in
patton,
in
patton
the
defendant
was
indicted
for
a
violation
of
a
federal
statute,
after
trial
had
started,
one
of
the
jurors
became
ill
and
the
court
asked
counsel
for
the
government
and
counsel
for
the
defendant
whether
they
wish
to
proceed
with
11
jurors
or
have
a
mistrial.
everybody
agreed,
counsel
for
the
defendant,
counsel
for
the
government
and
the
court
agreed
to
proceed
with
the
jury
of
11,
the
jury
of
11
convicted.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
that's
all
that
was
held
in
patton
versus
the
united
states,
and
it
was
held
that
--
what
was
held
of
course
was
that
the
trial
by
jury
of
11
which
the
opinion
in
patton
said
was
the
equivalent
of
a
non-jury
trial,
because
it
didn't
have
12
jurors.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
there
is
of
course
a
difference,
no
question
about
it,
the
difference
is
11
fold.
but
the
court
impact
and
the
solicitor
general's
brief
also
took
the
position
took
the
position
that
the
decision
in
patton
stands
for
the
proposition
that
a
jury
trial
can
be
waived
in
a
federal
felony
case.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
that's
what
it
said
on
the
next
to
the
last
stage
of
the
opinion
and
there
was
--
mr.
sidney
dorfman
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
that
is
correct,
but
that
last
--
mr.
sidney
dorfman
well,
if
you'll
look
at
page
298
of
the
same
opinion,
you
will
find
language
which
is
exactly
to
the
contrary,
because
on
page
298
of
the
same
opinion,
the
court
says
explicitly.
mr.
sidney
dorfman
not
on
page
298,
on
page
298
the
court
says
that
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
is
a
prerogative
of
the
defendant
which
he
may
forgo
at
his
election,
and
not
a
word
is
said
about
the
consent
of
the
government
until
you
get
to
the
very
end
of
the
opinion,
when
suddenly
as
an
afterthought
without
citation
of
any
authority,
without
any
reasoning,
without
any
basis
in
precedent,
law,
logic
or
practicality,
the
dictum
appears
in
the
opinion
and
its
plaguing
us
to
this
very
day.
thank
you
your
honor.
