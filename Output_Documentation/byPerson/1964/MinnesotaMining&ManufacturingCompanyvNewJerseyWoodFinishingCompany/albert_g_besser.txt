mr.
albert
g.
besser
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
on
three
separate
occasions
now,
i
have
listened
to
minnesota
mining
urge
vigorously
for
the
proposition
that
in
interpreting
section
5
of
the
clayton
act,
we
must
take
a
narrow
straight,
jacketed
road
to
be
concerned
with
an
almost
dictionary
like
interpretation
of
certain
words
in
section
5
upon
which
it
is
said
the
result
in
this
case
depends.
the
words,
the
keywords,
according
to
3m's
positions
of
course
are
criminal
or
civil
proceeding
as
we
have
in
the
1955
act
or
the
predecessor
words
namely
a
criminal
prosecution
or
suit
inequity.
now,
this
entire
narrow
approach,
it
seems
to
me
is
based
upon
a
misconception
on
the
part
of
3m
and
the
amicus
reynolds
aluminum
company
in
this
case.
namely,
an
assumption
that
the
average
private
plaintiff
in
a
private
antitrust
action
is
sophisticated
in
the
field
of
antitrust
law
and
is
sophisticated
with
the
respect
of
the
various
distinctions
that
are
so
important
to
us
lawyers
between
the
sherman
act,
and
the
clayton
act,
and
between
the
department
of
justice
and
the
federal
trade
commission.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
legislative
history
is
important
in
this
case
and
later
we
will,
i
hope
have
the
opportunity
to
consider
some
of
the
legislative
history,
if
legislative
history
is
important
in
this
case,
it
is
important
because
it
stands
for
one
clear
proposition,
initially
stressed
by
president
wilson,
when
he
recommended
adoption
of
the
clayton
act
in
1914.
namely
that
we
must
help
the
private
litigant
and
give
him
every
possible
aid
by
making
available
to
him,
some
of
the
benefits
of
proceedings
initiated
by
the
federal
government
unless
the
i
be
accused
of
finding
too
much
comfort
in
the
legislative
history,
i
respectfully
refer
this
court's
attention
to
the
initial
committee
report
authored
by
representative
clayton
and
referred
to
on
page
15
of
our
brief.
where
representative
clayton
in
recommending
adoption
of
the
original
language
of
a
section,
section
5,
stressed
that
this
act
is
intended
to
benefit
and
help
and
he
used
the
words
the
person
of
small
mean.
and
it
is
this
overrule
basic
policy
behind
the
statute
that
was
stressed
by
mr.
justice
clark
in
the
emich
case,
back
in
1940,
when
he
stressed
congressional
intention
to
benefit
the
private
litigant.
now,
my
adversary
as
he
did
below,
and
as
he
did
in
his
briefs,
in
his
oral
argument
to
this
court
devoted
most
of
his
time
to
a
consideration
not
of
section
5
(b)
which
is
a
primary
issue
before
this
court
but
section
5
(a).
there
has
been
an
intention
on
the
part
of
the
antitrust
defendants
in
these
cases,
namely
3m
and
reynolds
to
urge
to
the
court's
wrestling
with
the
tolling
provision
that
section's
(a)
and
section
(b)
must
be
considered
together.
now,
we
do
not
hesitate
to
support
the
conclusion
of
the
third
circuit
below
that
the
federal
trade
commission
can
generate
an
order
which
is
prima
facie
admissible
under
the
meaning
and
policy
of
section
5
(a).
but
we
take
that
position
and
we
brief
it,
although,
it
is
not
necessary
in
this
case,
not
because
we
agree
with
the
contention
that
these
two
sections
must
be
read
together,
but
purely
because
we
feel
that
there
is
substantial
basis
in
the
history
of
these
acts
to
support
that
proposition.
but
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me,
purely
on
a
basis
of
the
reading
of
the
two
sections
a
and
b
together,
there
isn't
the
slightest
support
for
the
proposition
for
which
3m
contends
that
on
a
last
day
proceeding
can
generate
evidence
prima
facie
admissible
under
section
5
(a),
it
is
not
the
kind
of
proceeding
which
will
toll
the
statute
of
under
5
(b).
now,
the
language
itself
makes
it
very
clear.
it
is
true
that
in
both
sections,
the
words
criminal
or
civil
proceeding
are
used
but
there
the
identity
between
the
two
sections
stopped.
section
5
(a)
deals
with
final
decrees
or
judgments
and
those
keywords
are
not
mentioned
at
all
in
section
5
(b).
furthermore,
section
5
(a)
as
were
stressed
by
mr.
justice
clark
in
the
emich
case,
implements
into
a
consideration
of
5
(a)
the
key
and
sometimes
troublesome
question
of
estoppel.
section
5
(a)
says,
that
a
final
order
or
decree
shall
be
prima
facie
admissible
against
the
defendant
in
subsequent
private
litigation
only
in
those
cases
whether
would
be
an
estoppel
as
between
the
parties
to
the
original
government
proceedings.
section
5
(b)
does
not
contain
any
reference
whatsoever
to
an
estoppel
problem
when
considering
section
5
(a)
as
the
emich
case
in
1940
made
so
plainly
clear.
the
courts
must
not
only
consider
what
the
matters
were,
which
were
complained
of
in
the
government
proceeding
but
the
courts
must
go
further
and
inquire
into
the
government
proceeding
in
order
to
determine
what
matters
were
necessarily
decided
in
the
government
proceeding
before
5
(a)
can
come
into
play.
but
the
words
in
section
5
(b)
are
dramatically
different
because
5
(b)
says,
that
the
statute
of
limitation
will
be
told
with
respect
to
every
private
right
of
action
arising
under
the
antitrust
laws
based
in
whole
or
in
part
--
in
whole
or
in
part
upon
any
matter,
not
all
matters,
but
any
matter
complained
on
--
not
decided
but
merely
complained
of
in
a
proceeding
instituted
by
the
united
states
to
enforce,
restrain
or
a
prevent
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
law.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
dramatic
difference
between
the
two
sections
stands
for
the
proposition,
while
section
(b)
undoubtedly
was
created
by
congress
in
1914
primarily
for
the
purpose
of
giving
to
the
private
litigants,
the
benefits
that
flow
from
section
5
(a)
and
his
ability
to
use
at
least
prima
facie,
the
results
achieved
by
the
government.
there
are
other
incidental
benefits
which
flow
merely
from
the
initiation
of
a
government
proceeding
which
benefits
are
discussed
by
us
in
our
brief
and
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
and
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
to
give
to
the
person
of
small
means,
these
incidental
benefits.
incidentally,
judge
muir
in
the
nisley
case,
ninth
circuit
case
i
believe,
to
which
reference
is
made
by
us
in
our
brief.
also,
commented
upon
the
difference
in
the
statute
or
the
difference
in
the
sections
and
stressed
these
incidental
benefits.
and
also
stressed
the
important
fact
that
when
dealing
or
wrestling
with
section
5
(b),
we
do
not
have
to
be
concerned
with
the
question
of
a
estoppel
which
necessarily
is
a
standard
in
implementing
5
(a).
i
don't
think
that
it
--
i
have
no
hesitation
in
conceding
to
this
court
what
is
obvious.
if
one
takes
the
initial
complaint
filed
by
or
by
new
jersey
wood
in
this
case
and
lays
it
alongside
of
a
federal
trade
commission
complaint.
i
have
no
--
i
very
humbly
confess
that
the
initial
complaint
was
an
almost
an
identical
paraphrase
of
much
of
the
language
in
the
federal
trade
commission
initial
complaint.
this
is
one
of
the
benefits,
in
short,
which
can
flow
to
a
private
litigation
--
to
a
private
litigant
aside
from
his
use
of
evidence
under
section
5
(a)
as
our
brief
and
as
a
solicitor
general's
brief
point
out
a
government
proceeding
regardless
of
the
result
is
helpful
to
the
private
litigant
in
analyzing
the
fundamental
concepts
which
apply
in
his
case,
in
assisting
him
and
evaluating
the
strength
of
his
case
and
pin-pointing
for
him
certain
specific
evidence
any
events
elaborated
upon
or
brought
out
a
highlighted
by
the
government
proceedings
which
are
of
importance
to
him
and
the
presentation
and
ultimate
development
of
his
case.
and
all
of
his
benefits
will
plugged
to
the
private
litigate
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
the
government
case
whether
it
terminates
in
an
exoneration
of
the
defendant
which
is
not
the
case
here
or
whether
it
terminates
in
a
consent
decree.
it
seems
to
me
and
3m
was
very
frank
to
confess
to
the
district
court
and
the
third
circuit
that
the
logical
extension
of
its
argument
through
the
sections
5
(a)
and
5
(b)
must
be
construed
together
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
in
any
case
whether
initiated
by
the
department
of
justice
or
the
federal
trade
commission
which
finally
is
concluded
by
a
consent
decree,
the
benefits
inherent
in
section
5
(b),
namely,
the
tolling
benefits
will
not
apply.
in
other
words,
that
3m
and
it
says
so
at
page
64
of
its
brief
before
this
court.
the
argument
is
made
but
there
is
conclusive
evidence
that
congress
intended
tolling
to
occur
only
in
the
event
of
an
admissible
final
decree.
now,
that
argument
means
this,
it's
says
to
have
private
litigant,
“don't
wait
around
until
the
government
proceeding
is
terminated
because
you
don't
know
how
that
proceeding
will
wind
up.
you'll
better
fire
away
with
your
private
suit
right
now
because
the
government
proceeding
may
drag
on
for
a
year
or
two,
or
three
years,
and
then
it
will
terminated
by
a
consent
decree.”
and
then
according
to
the
argument
of
minnesota
mining
at
page
64
of
its
brief,
“having
terminated
in
the
consent
decree
that
polling
provision
of
section
5
(b)
is
no
longer
available
to
you
to
private
litigant.”
so,
we
winds
up
with
a
result
that
completely
undercuts
the
whole
philosophy
of
section
5
(b).
not
only
does
it
undercut
the
philosophy
of
section
5
(b)
but
imposes
additional
burdens
even
on
defendants
an
antitrust
case
because
as
judge
murrah
and
i
believe
in
the
nisley
case
pointed
out,
“if
you
have
concurrent
government
proceedings
and
private
litigation
going
on
simultaneously,
the
defendant
maybe
harassed.”
the
two
proceedings
deal
with
the
same
basic
facts
and
he
on
the
one
hand
is
trying
to
defend
themselves
against
the
government
and
on
the
other
hand
to
defend
themselves
against
the
private
litigant.
we
feel
very
strongly
that
if
there
is
one
thing
that
is
clear
in
the
legislative
history
underlying
section
5
of
the
clayton
act,
it
is
a
deliberate
encouragement
by
congress
to
the
private
litigant
to
hold
off
this
litigation
until
these
government
proceedings
have
been
included.
now,
it
seems
to
me
also
that
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
in
our
argument
that
a
federal
trade
commission
proceeding
is
such
as
we
have
tolled
statute
under
section
5
(b)
with
all
of
the
other
matters
that
have
been
a
concern
to
this
court.
for
example,
as
the
government
points
out
in
this
brief
to
this
court
tolling
the
statute
because
a
proceeding
is
pending
before
the
federal
trade
commission,
certainly
does
no
injustice
to
the
defendant
because
he
has
already
been
alerted
by
the
initiation
of
the
federal
trade
commission
proceeding.
if
there
are
maybe
some
violation
for
the
antitrust
laws
inherent
in
the
fact
situation
which
is
the
basis
of
the
federal
trade
commission
proceeding,
nor
the
government
points
out
is
there
any
reason
so
far
as
the
courts
are
concerned,
why
we
should
not
come
up
with
the
result
for
which
we
had.
evidence
will
have
been
preserved
by
the
pendency
of
the
proceedings
before
the
federal
trade
commission
just
as
effectively
as
it
has
been
preserved
by
a
proceeding
initiated
by
the
department
of
justice.
now,
there's
an
interesting
argument
made
by
minnesota
mining
in
his
brief
and
also
referred
to
by
my
adversary
in
oral
argument
namely
that
the
result
for
which
we
contend
will
be
to
discourage
defendants
in
government
proceedings
from
entering
into
a
consent
decree
because
as
i
understand
the
argument.
they
will
hold
back.
they
will
say,
“well,
if
we
enter
into
our
consent
decree.
we
are
opening
ourselves
up
to
private
suit
beyond
the
time
that
ordinarily
would
be
possible
where
the
four
years
statute
of
limitations
derived.”
well,
i
submit
that
this
really
is
not
a
sound
argument.
i
don't
presume
to
speak
for
minnesota
mining
in
this
case
but
it
seems
to
me
very
clearly
that
when
a
defendant
in
a
proceeding
initiative
by
the
government
being
the
department
of
justice
or
the
federal
trade
commission
agrees
to
a
consent
judgment.
it
is
motivated
by
perhaps
two
basic
purposes.
first
of
all,
it
desired
to
avoid
the
obvious
expense
in
time
and
difficulty
of
litigation,
but
secondly
and
most
importantly,
to
avoid
the
implications
of
section
5
(a).
this
it
seems
to
me
and
as
far
as
i
can
read
all
of
the
commentators,
this
is
the
key
reason
underlying
a
decision,
or
the
defendant,
and
antitrust
case
to
accept
that
consent
decree
because
why
and
he
puts
his
name
to
consent
decree
before
any
testimony
has
been
taken.
he
is
obviating
or
preventing
the
subsequent
private
litigant
from
using
that
government
proceeding
as
evidence
or
prima
facie
evidence
under
section
5
(a).
it
seems
to
me
that
our
argument
that
the
federal
trade
commission
proceeding
is
a
proceeding
which
will
toll
the
statute
under
section
5
(b)
buying
some
support
in
current
administrative
interpretation,
which
is
inherent
and
a
proposal
recently
submitted
by
the
federal
trade
commission
to
congress
to
amend
section
5.
but
amend
only
section
5
(a)
by
broadening
it
to
include
federal
trade
commission
orders.
and
incidentally,
we
don't
think
that
that
suggestion
has
made
because
i
feel
that
this
is
not
the
law
but
given
the
conflict
between
the
eighth
circuit
and
the
third
circuit
it's
perfectly
legitimate
suggestion
by
the
federal
trade
commission
to
at
least
clarify
it
out.
but
the
federal
trade
commission
has
made
no
such
suggestion
to
amend
or
change
the
phraseology
of
section
5
(b).
so,
i
think
we
can
safely
assume
from
that
present
suggestion
to
congress,
a
belief
at
least
by
the
federal
trade
commission
that
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
current
construction
to
be
applied
to
5
(b)
and
that
it
necessarily
must
include
federal
trade
commission
proceeding.
our
approach
is
consistent
with
the
one
case
for
the
few
cases
that
touch
on
this
point
as
to
whether
(a)
and
(b)
must
be
construed
together.
namely
the
nisley
case
to
which
we
have
already
refer.
and
finally
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
the
most
compelling
argument
of
all.
so
far
as
the
dichotomy
between
sections
5
(a)
and
5
(b)
are
concerned
and
the
fundamental
necessity
of
at
least
holding
of
5
(b)
must
include
federal
trade
commission
proceedings.
namely,
that
if
we
adhere
to
the
proposition
for
which
minnesota
mining
depends
and
if
we
say
to
private
litigants
that
your
period
of
limitations
is
going
to
be
tolled
as
the
department
of
justice,
moves
in
this
antitrust
area
but
it
is
not
going
to
be
tolled
where
the
federal
trade
commission,
moves
on
precisely
the
same
facts
and
under
precisely
the
same
statute.
we
are
introducing
into
a
whole
concept
of
antitrust
enforcement,
a
matter
of
happenstance,
a
matter
of
pure
fortuitous
events
as
judge
argyle
on
the
district
court
referred
to
it.
in
other
words,
the
rights
of
the
litigant,
the
rights
of
new
jersey
wood
in
this
case
that
bring
a
suit
based
upon
the
gobbling
up
by
minnesota
mining
of
its
distributor
throughout
the
country
will
depend
or
just
the
purely
fortuitous
circumstance
here
that
the
federal
trade
commission
has
opposed
to
the
department
of
justice
initiated
a
complaint
predicated
upon
section
7
of
the
clayton.
and
as
solicitor
general,
points
out
in
his
amicus
brief
of
this
court
to
wind
up
with
that
proposition
would
introduce
a
very
troublesome
problem
in
the
sphere
intra-governmental
cooperation
so
far
as
enforcement
of
these
laws
is
concern.
we
are
told
that
there
are
--
now
it
is
close
cooperation
between
the
justice
department
and
federal
trade
commission.
so
far
as
enforcement
of
these
various
antitrust
acts
are
concerned
where
they
have
overlapping
jurisdictions
and
they
have
worked
out
a
policy
between
them.
but
now,
if
we
are
to
be
governed
by
the
minnesota
mining's
approach
in
this
case.
one
of
the
factors
which
the
government,
the
federal
trade
commission
and
the
department
of
justice
will
have
to
consider,
is
whether
they
let
the
federal
trade
commission
proceed,
they
will
not
now
seriously
cut
down
the
period
during
which
a
private
litigant
may
bring
a
suit.
now,
much
has
been
made
of
the
legislative
history
of
this
case,
although,
i
was
quite
happy
to
hear
my
adversary
tone
down
the
obvious
emphasis
upon
legislative
history
which
is
apparent
in
minnesota
mining's
brief
and
in
the
brief
of
the
amicus
brief
of
reynolds
aluminum
company.
and
here
in
coming
to
grips
with
some
of
the
legislative
history
and
i
don't
want
to
get
into
a
too
much
detail.
it
seems
to
that
we
have
to
start
with
one
aspect
of
the
legislative
history
which
is
abundantly
clear.
namely
in
1914,
when
congress
adopted
the
clayton
act,
it
was
dealing
with
two
revolutionary
pieces
of
legislation.
it
was
dissatisfied
with
the
history
of
enforcement
of
the
sherman
act
since
1890.
and
it
was
considering
simultaneously
adoption
of
the
clayton
act
in
the
federal
trade
commission
act
which
were
two
major
pieces
of
litigation.
and
it
would
be
extremely
unlikely
that
congress
with
if
the
overall
problem
before
it
would
deal
specifically
with
the
very
fine
albeit,
very
important
question
with
which
we
are
confronted
now,
namely
a
question
of
the
tolling
of
the
statute
of
limitation
and
i
think,
we're
right
in
that
analysis
of
the
situation.
because
certainly
with
respect
to
the
tolling
issue
which
is
a
key
issue
before
this
court
as
minnesota
mining
before
the
third
circuit
admitted
in
its
brief
there
is
a
complete
turn
of
any
legislative
history
one
way
or
the
other.
in
fact,
the
only
reason
why
we
are
here
now
concerned
with
legislative
history.
it
seems
to
me,
is
because
the
third
circuit
went
into
it
in
much
more
depth
and
characterized
the
arguments
of
either
of
us
before
that
court.
now,
i
think
what
minnesota
mining
and
particularly
reynolds
has
done
in
contending
tremendous
volume
of
legislative
history,
is
cost
over
$4
to
send
through
the
mail,
is
to
go
through
51
of
a
congressional
record
starting
at
page
one.
and
regardless
of
the
context
of
which
it
finds
the
record,
every
single
statement
by
every
member
of
congress
where
in
the
key
word
“court,
equity,
government,
or
the
united
states”
were
used
and
then
bundled
it
all
up
and
submitted
it
to
us
for
the
proposition.
the
congress
never
intended
to
include
the
federal
trade
commission
within
the
sweep
of
what
now
is
section
5
of
the
clayton
act.
actually,
as
the
government
in
its
brief
makes
clear
and
as
i
hope
we
made
clear
in
our
brief.
95%
of
a
congressional
debates
to
which
our
attention
has
been
directed
came
at
a
time
when
congress
was
dealing
with
the
troublesome
question
of
whether
to
make
section
5
(a)
--
whether
to
move
section
5
(a)
along
the
road
of
making
final
decrees
and
order's
conclusive
evidence
as
distinguished
from
the
language
which
eventually
came
out
of
congress,
namely,
that
it
would
be
only
prima
facie
admissible
against
the
defendant
in
subsequent
private
litigation.
and
most
of
the
debate
to
which
our
attention
has
been
directed
came
up
at
a
time
when
the
federal
trade
commission
act
was
still
on
the
drawing
boards,
it
had
not
yet
been
submitted
to
congress.
so
naturally,
when
we
have
cited
to
us
debate
by
the
members
of
congress
with
reference
to
the
sweep
of
section
of
5,
there
could
not
be
a
consideration
of
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
it
was
intended
to
cover
the
federal
trade
commission.
i
think,
even
my
adversary
agrees
with
the
reference
on
mr.
justice
jackson
and
in
the
swagman
case
when
mr.
justice
jackson
pointed
out
the
terrible
unreliability
of
resorting
to
legislative
history
and
particularly,
the
very
treacherous
ground
by
which
we
plead
when
we
resort
to
congressional
debate
as
distinguished
from
house
reports
or
committee
report.
and
i
think
that
this
analysis
can
be
borne
out
by
looking
at
one
or
two
specific
bits
of
legislative
history
that
have
been
cited
to
us
by
minnesota
mining
or
reynolds
aluminum,
or
indeed
the
government.
for
example,
the
great
emphasis
is
placed
upon
the
debates
between
mrs.
sutherland
and
crawford
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
referred
to
at
page
34
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
page
22
of
the
brief
of
minnesota
mining
in
which
--
during
the
course
of
colloquy,
i
think
it
was
senator
sutherland
said
and
i
quote,
“i
do
not
think
that
they
referring
to
federal
trade
commission
orders
ought
to
be
evidenced
anywhere
--
now,
this
is
cited
to
us
as
clear
proof
that
those
responsible
for
section
5
never
contemplated
that
section
5
would
include
within
its
ambit
federal
trade
commission
proceedings.”
but
if
you
look
at
the
context
in
which
that
statement
was
made
by
senator
sutherland,
you
will
see,
first
of
all
that,
he
was
dealing
not
with
the
clayton
act
but
with
the
federal
trade
commission
act
which
is
not
by
statutory
definition
an
antitrust
law.
it
was
never
the
slightest
suggestion,
we
agree
with
anybody,
by
anybody
that
the
action
of
the
federal
trade
commission
under
the
federal
trade
commission
act
would
be
implemented
into
section
5
of
the
clayton
act.
furthermore,
senator
sutherland
was
dealing
with
a
proposed
amendment
again
through
the
federal
trade
commission
act
which
would
specifically
state
that,
no
order
for
the
federal
trade
commission
act
shall
be
evidenced
in
any
subsequent
proceeding.
this
is
all
set
forth
on
the
page
34
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief
and
the
interesting
thing
is
that
that
amendment
did
not
pass.
now,
i
think
one
could
with
equal
weighing,
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
mere
fact
that
congress
--
that
senator
sutherland
and
crawford
were
concerned
that
under
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
you
might
wind
up
with
an
order
which
is
prima
facie
admissible.
it
shows
a
realization
insofar
as
the
clayton
act
is
concerned
and
is
precisely
the
result
that
would
follow
and
a
result
apparently
with
which
they
did
not
disagree.
references
are
made
at
page
36
and
37
of
the
amicus
brief
of
reynolds
through
the
statement
by
senator
walsh
who
was
a
strong
advocate
of
a
house
version.
he
strongly
contended
that
evidence
under
section
5
(a)
should
be
conclusive
evidence
against
the
defendant
in
subsequent
private
civil
litigation.
and
in
that
colloquy
cited
at
pages
36
and
37
of
the
reynolds
amicus
brief
and
32
of
the
government's
brief,
he
does
say
that,
“the
findings
of
the
administrative
board
can
not
constitute
conclusive
evidence.”
he
was
attempting
to
a
sludge,
some
of
the
other
members
of
congress
who
had
doubts
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
section
5
(a)
but
he
did
go
on
in
the
language
which
is
also
reproduced
at
page
32
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
and
he
did
say
that
i
think
that
the
findings
of
the
administrative
agency
can
constitute
prima
facie
evidence
in
subsequent
civil
litigation.
so,
we
could
argue
that
when
section
5
(a)
was
changed
from
the
house
version
from
conclusive
evidence
to
prima
facie
evidence,
at
least
in
the
minds
of
senator
walsh,
it
was
now
an
intent
to
accept
that
change
so
as
to
make
findings
of
administrative
agencies,
at
least
prima
facie
admissible.
great
emphasis
is
placed
by
my
adversaries
on
certain
statements
who
were
made
to
i
believe
a
house
committee
in
1951
by
mr.
kenneth
royall
and
mr.
johnson,
who
was
the
head
of
the
american
bar
association
antitrust
committee,
and
they
were
dealing
with
the
proposed
amendment
to
section
5
which
ultimately
was
adopted
in
1955,
namely
the
change
from
the
original
statutory
language,
criminal
proceeding
or
a
suit
in
equity
to
what
we
now
have,
namely,
criminal
or
civil
proceeding.
and
mr.
royall
and
mr.
johnson
were
worried
that
this
chain
would
somehow
or
other
bring
within
section
5
findings
or
orders
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
and
mr.
royall
in
particular
in
colloquy
which
is
set
forth
at
pages
59
to
62
of
the
amicus
brief
from
reynolds.
they
were
asked,
well,
do
you
think
there's
any
real
danger
here,
if
i
--
this
language
we
will
include
the
federal
trade
commission
within
the
sweep
of
section
5?
and
may
have
proposed
to
congress
an
amendment
which
would
specifically
negate
that
possibility.
and
mr.
royall
said,
“well,
if
there
is
the
slightest
apprehension
that
that
will
be
the
result
of
the
suggested
amendment,
i
firmly
believe
that
this
amendment
negating
that
possibility
should
be
adopted.”
now
minnesota
mining
and
reynolds
find
comforts
in
that
colloquy,
i
can
with
equal
vigor
say
that,
when
congress
with
the
specific
problem
pinpointed
by
this
colloquy
did
not
adapt
the
suggested
amendment,
it
did
so
knowingly
and
with
an
intension
therefore
that
federal
trade
commission
proceedings
would
come
and
should
come
under
section
5
of
the
clayton
act.
finally,
particularly
in
3m's
required
brief
filed
a
few
days
ago.
attention
of
this
court
is
directed
to
the
facts
that
somehow
or
other
the
words
“on
the
behalf
of”
which
do
appear
in
section
5
(a)
of
the
clayton
act
were
eliminated
from
5
(b),
so
that
while
5
(a)
referred
only
to
criminal
or
civil
proceedings
initiated
by
or
on
behalf
of
5
(b)
refers
only
to
proceedings
initiated
by
the
united
states.
legislative
analysis
shows
that
those
words
would
drop
that
the
time
after
they
do
came
over
to
the
senate
from
a
house.
now,
3m
characterizes
this
omission
as
deliberate,
reading
into
the
omission
of
these
words
from
congressional
intent.
there
hasn't
been
the
slightest
threats
to
any
congressional
debate
or
colloquy
which
in
anyway
supports
the
argument
that
congress
deliberately
intended
some
kind
of
a
distinction
because
it
left
out
the
words
on
behalf
of
in
section
5
(b).
we
could
just
as
easily
assume
with
a
complete
lack
of
any
record
in
this
regard
that
some
stenographer
in
retyping
the
drafts
simply
left
it
out
and
no
one
picked
it
up.
i
would
like
now
to
touch
on
i
think
a
question
suggested
by
mr.
justice
harland,
namely,
the
presence
or
absence
of
any
judicial
help
in
this
field
and
it
is
true
that
until
this
case
was
initiated,
the
only
authority
that
really
in
anyway
came
to
grips
with
the
issue
was
the
brunswick
case
in
1945
and
1946,
and
the
much
earlier
appropriate
case
of
1923.
dealing
solely
with
the
brunswick
case,
we
have
there.
it
seems
to
me,
a
square
holding
in
support
of
a
proposition
for
which
we
now
contend.
namely,
that
a
proceeding
initiated
by
the
federal
trade
commission
qualifies
not
only
under
section
5
(b)
but
under
section
5
(a)
because
in
the
brunswick
case,
we
had
an
effort
by
a
private
litigant.
validated
in
its
initial
opinion
by
the
second
circuit,
to
use
as
prima
facie
evidence
in
a
private
action,
a
previous
order
of
the
federal
trade
commission
dealing
with
the
same
facts,
and
second
circuit
in
a
divided
opinion
two
to
one
opinion
did
affirm
that
resolved
it,
held
that
the
federal
trade
commission
order
was
admissible
under
section
5
(a).
now
on
rehearing,
it
was
pointed
out
through
the
second
circuit
that
a
federal
trade
commission
proceedings
wherein
the
federal
trade
commission
was
acting
under
the
clayton
act
as
distinguished
from
the
federal
trade
commission
act
was
not
a
final
proceeding
because
while
the
statute
have
been
changed
by
the
--
i
think
it's
the
wheeler--lea
act
back
in
1938
with
respect
to
proceedings
under
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
so
far
as
federal
trade
commission
proceedings
under
the
clayton
act
were
concerned
a
decree
or
order
of
the
ftc
was
not
final
until
it
have
proceeded
to
the
circuit
courts
for
enforcement.
mr.
albert
g.
besser
thank
your
honor.
i
would
like
very
briefly
before
coming
back
to
a
considerations
of
pauper
and
brunswick
cases
to
pick
an
argument
that
was
made
by
my
adversary
and
which
he
suggested
and
as
early
as
the
fall
of
1956,
new
jersey
wood
was
advised
of
the
acquisition
by
minnesota
mining
of
our
distributor
and
we
were
there
for
put
on
notice
as
to
the
consequences
that
we
would
suffer
as
of
january
1,
1957,
namely,
that
they're
after
iwi
would
no
longer
sell
our
good.
i
suppose,
the
suggestion
is
and
it
paraphrases
the
argument
threading
minnesota
mining's
briefs
throughout
the
history
of
this
case,
namely,
that
new
jersey
wood
select
on
its
rights
--
actually,
i'm
thankful
that
he
suggested
the
point
of
this
court
because
i
think
it
highlights
once
again
a
proposition
that
we
were
discussing
earlier
this
morning,
namely,
that
there
are
various
significant
purposes
to
section
5
(b),
separate
and
apart
from
the
prima
facie
evidence
admissibility
question
under
section
5
(a).
there
are
--
mr.
albert
g.
besser
well,
there's
no
question
mr.
justice
black,
but
we
can
maintain
our
position
regardless
of
what
this
court
might
choose
to
do
or
say
with
respect
to
the
section
5
(a)
question.
we
feel
that
there
are
so
many
basically
additional
purposes
to
section
5
(b)
that
even
if
this
court
should
hold
the
ftc
proceeding
is
not
of
the
kind
that
and
generate
evidence
admissible
under
5
(a)
that
should
not
preclude
this
court
from
affirming
the
judgment
below,
namely,
that
so
far
as
tolling
is
concerned
our
rights
would
preserve
by
this
proceeding
and
i
think
the
question
is
that
the
issue
was
highlighted
by
the
suggestion
of
my
adversary
because
one
benefit
that
blows
from
the
initiation
of
a
government
proceeding
regardless
of
how
it
terminates,
is
that
it
signals
to
the
private
litigant
that
he
may
or
will
have
a
claim
under
the
antitrust
laws.
we
get
back
to
the
proposition
with
which
i
started
this
morning
that,
i
think
is
clear
in
the
legislative
history.
namely,
the
congress
had
in
mind
the
person
of
“small
means”
when
it
was
drafting
section
5,
and
it
is
simply
not
a
correct
assumption
to
make
that
a
private
litigant
such
as
new
jersey
woods
having
them
told
by
iwi
that
it
is
no
longer
going
to
sell
new
jersey
woods
good
because
it
has
been
purchased
by
minnesota
mining.
it
is
unwarranted
to
assume
that
new
jersey
wood
is
sophisticated
enough
to
realize
that
it
has
a
cause
of
action
under
the
antitrust
law,
a
practical
businessman
with
no
house
counsel
and
no
history
of
antitrust
litigation,
does
not
necessarily
understand
that
when
his
distributor
has
been
bought
up
by
a
competitor,
he
has
a
right
to
obtain
redress
for
his
injuries
in
the
court,
and
it
is
not
until
all
he
knows
is
that
the
federal
government
is
doing
something
about
it.
but
finally
in
august
in
1961,
he
knows
by
a
publicity
release
of
the
federal
trade
commission
that
the
proceedings
initiated
by
the
federal
trade
commission
have
resulted
in
a
consent
decree.
and
regardless
of
what
minnesota
mining
may
say
as
to
a
half
or
a
quarter
of
above
that
the
federal
trade
commission
was
willing
to
accept
in
that
consent
decree
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
as
the
result
of
that
consent
decree
minnesota
mining
agreed
to
divest
itself
of
iwi
which
was
the
key
acquisition
that
caused
damage
to
my
client
according
to
the
complaint
filed
in
this
case.
until
the
unsophisticated
private
litigant
in
an
antitrust
case,
it
is
this
flash
from
the
federal
trade
commission
that
alerts
him
to
the
fact
that
he
may
have
a
cause
of
action
under
the
antitrust
laws.
this
--
mr.
albert
g.
besser
no
question
about
it
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
albert
g.
besser
i
think
your
honor
is
perfectly
right,
and
i
would
even
go
so
far
to
say
that
this
was
the
major
purpose
as
far
as
congress
was
concerned
in
1914.
but
it
is
consistent
with
the
overall
policy
of
the
statute
to
hold
that
the
section
(b)
has
broader
in
sweep
in
section
5
(a)
because
of
these
other
incidental
benefits
that
flow
to
a
private
litigant
aside
from
the
evidence
question
under
5
(a).
and
it
is
consistent
to
make
these
other
benefits
available
to
him
even
though
and
i
do
not
think
that
it
must
follow,
even
though
or
even
should
this
court
hold
or
decide
ultimately
that
a
federal
trade
commission
proceeding
does
not
come
within
the
ambit
of
section
5
(a).
we
were
discussing
the
brunswick
and
the
pauper
cases
before
the
luncheon
recess
and
it
is
our
feeling
that
the
brunswick
case
does
stand
for
the
proposition
that,
a
federal
trade
commission
proceeding
is
covered
not
by
section
5
(a)
and
section
5
(b).
that
after
all
was
a
holding
of
judge
frank
before
the
rehearing.
he
had
no
trouble
with
the
proposition
that
a
federal
trade
commission
proceeding
is,
at
that
time
the
language,
was
a
proceeding,
or
rather
a
suit
in
equity.
he
was
not,
in
fact
that
apparently
from
the
opinion,
the
argument
was
not
even
advanced,
oh!
yes,
it
was
and
it's
pickup
by
the
dissenting
judge
evans,
but
judge
frank
had
no
trouble
with
that,
sir?
mr.
albert
g.
besser
he
dissented
on
the
original
brunswick
case.
mr.
albert
g.
besser
that
is
your
honor
i
just
don't
know
mr.
justice
harlan.
he
was
on
the
court
which
considered
the
brunswick
case
and
he
did.
he
spotlighted
the
issue.
he
said
that,
he
could
not
agree
with
the
holding
of
the
majority
of
the
court
that
a
federal
trade
commission
proceeding
was
a
suit
in
equity,
as
that
phrase
was
used
in
section
5
(a).
now,
it
is
true
as
we
observed
before
that
on
rehearing,
the
court
reversed
itself,
it
was
not
because
it
was
concerned
with
the
suit
in
equity
language.
it
reversed
itself
because
it
then
realized
that
an
order
of
the
federal
trade
commission
was
not
“final”
within
the
meaning
of
section
5
(a)
because
at
that
stage
of
our
legislative
history
a
decree
of
a
commission
was
not
self-enforcing
to
what
the
commission
had
to
affirmatively
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
an
enforcement
decree.
now,
the
only
other
case
which
has
been
cited
to
us
throughout
the
judicial
history
of
this
case?
is
that
district
court
case,
the
eastern
district
of
new
york,
the
pauper
case
and
i
frankly
find
some
amazement
that
this
lower
court
case
has
been
ballooned
all
out
of
proportion
to
the
proposition
for
which
stood.
not
because
it's
a
decision
of
a
federal
district
court
judge
but
because
on
analysis
that
pauper
case
was
dealing
with
a
situation
where
an
attempt
was
made
by
a
private
litigant
to
avail
himself
off
an
order
by
the
federal
trade
commission
that
that's
where
we
stop.
first
of
all,
the
judge
in
the
pauper
case
quite
correctly
pointed
out
that
in
no
event
could
the
federal
trade
commission
order
the
availed
off
as
against
this
defendant
and
this
private
action
because
he
wasn't
a
party
in
the
government
proceedings.
so
simply
on
basic
corn
book
principles
of
res
judicata,
the
result
of
the
district
court
of
that
case
was
correct.
and
secondly
and
conclusively,
it
seems
to
me
you
read
the
pauper
case
and
you
find
that
the
order
entered
by
the
federal
trade
commission
was
an
order
in
a
proceeding
under
the
federal
trade
commission
act,
which
has
never
been
defined
by
congress
as
an
antitrust
law
and
no
order
entered
in
any
proceeding
involving
interpretation
on
a
federal
trade
commission
act
can
qualify
as
evidence
prima
facie
admissible
under
section
5
of
the
clayton
act.
so
limited
to
those
two
facts
nobody
can
quarrel
with
the
pauper
case.
then
the
district
court
went
further
and
it
is
this
final
observation
which
has
been
ballooned
and
mushroomed
throughout
the
briefing
in
this
case,
said
that
the
district
court
judge,
he
is
inclined
to
doubt
whether
a
federal
trade
commission
proceeding
is
“a
suit
in
equity
under
section
5
of
clayton
act.”
well,
he
wasn't
inclined
to
doubt
that,
but
i
submit
that
the
doubt
expressed
by
the
district
court
judge
in
the
pauper
case
must
yield
to
the
lengthy
description
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
mandel
case,
and
the
pan
american
airways
against
the
united
states
case
in
which
he
--
this
court
through
mr.
justice
douglas
dealt
at
lengthy
with
the
powers
of
the
federal
trade
commission
or
administrative
bodies
to
shape
it's
decrees
according
to
the
facts
before
it.
these
cases
referred
to
in
the
philadelphia
banking
case.
it
seems
to
me
squarely
analogized,
an
administrative
of
body
which
is
molding
a
decree
to
a
court
in
equity.
in
fact,
the
very
language
of
this
court
it
seems
to
me
should
dissipate
completely
the
doubts
and
in
appropriate
case
as
to
whether
the
federal
trade
commission
is
a
proceeding
in
equity
for
purposes
of
section
5
because
mr.
justice
douglas
in
discussing
the
ability
of
a
federal
trade
commission
to
require
divestiture,
certainly,
not
a
power
expressly
given
to
the
commission
by
any
enabling
legislation,
in
footnote
17
said,
we
have
heretofore
analogized
the
power
of
administrative
agencies
to
fashion
appropriate
relief
to
the
power
of
courts
to
fashion
sherman
act
decree
so,
we
are
actuated.
the
administrative
agencies
with
the
power
of
courts
and
then
further,
the
court
observed
authority
to
mold
administrative
decrees
is
indeed
like
the
authority
of
courts
to
frame
injunctive
decrees.
so,
when
you
get
right
down
to
it
there
is
very,
very
little
difference
between
the
actual
power
of
a
federal
trade
commission
proceeding
or
the
federal
trade
commission
itself
when
proceeding
under
the
antitrust
law
and
the
power
of
a
federal
district
court
in
a
proceeding
initiated
by
the
department
of
justice.
indeed
as
judge
wyzanski
observed
in
the
united
shoe
machinery
case
back
in
1950
referred
to
at
length
by
my
adversary
and
us,
he
observed
that
there
was
very
little
difference
between
the
treatment
of
a
court
when
sitting
without
a
jury
of
antitrust
problems,
and
antitrust
cases,
and
the
treatment
which
would
be
accorded
to
the
same
kind
of
case
by
the
federal
trade
commission.
judge
wyzanski
in
the
united
shoe
machinery
case
was
wrestling
with
the
question
of
whether
to
admit
certain
kinds
of
evidence
which
traditionally
would
fall
within
the
hearsay
rule
and
he
conceded
that
maybe
the
result
might
be
different
where
we
had
a
jury
but
he
said,
so
far
as
a
district
court
judge
sitting
in
this
kind
of
a
case.
there
should
be
no
difference
between
my
reception
of
evidence
in
such
a
capacity
and
the
--
undoubted
acceptance
of
such
evidence
by
the
federal
trade
commission
in
a
proceeding
for
it
based
on
the
same
substantive
law.
so,
we
feel
very
strongly
that
whatever
judicial
authority
does
exist
supports
our
proposition
that
the
federal
trade
commission
at
least
in
1965
should
be
held
to
get
--
to
come
within
the
sweep
of
both
sections
of
--
section
5
and
certainly
section
b.
mr.
justice
harlan
and
i
think
questioned
counsel
about
the
chronology
of
the
events.
when
was
the
finality
act
pass
with
respect
to
the
brunswick
case,
for
example?
and
that
might
trigger
the
question
well
when
did
happen,
that
the
federal
trade
commission
came
to
be
included
within
the
section
5?
did
it
happen
with
the
finality
act
as
judge
mclaughlin
it
has
been
argued
--
says
it
happen
or
did
it
happen
back
in
1914?
well
i
think
our
answer
to
that
would
be
this.
i
would
frankly
say
of
this
court
that,
if
i
were
standing
before
this
court
40
years
ago,
it
would
be
more
difficult
to
argue
that
the
federal
trade
commission
as
then
constituted
could
generate
an
order
admissible
under
section
5.
i
don't
have
that
problem
with
section
b.
but
over
the
years
as
exemplified
by
congressional
action,
the
passage
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
as
exemplified
by
this
court's
treatment
of
administrative
agencies
and
the
broad
scope
of
the
decrees
which
they
can
render,
we
have
evolved
a
concept
of
administrative
agency
which
seems
to
me
to
make
it
no
different
from
a
court
sitting
in
equity.
so,
i
would
say
that
the
--
mr.
albert
g.
besser
well,
your
honor
that
has
been
pointed
out
by
my
adversary
as
one
big
reason
why
we
--
at
least
for
purposes
of
5
(a),
we
should
not
hold
the
ftc
to
the
included.
as
i
have
indicated
judge
wyzanski
has
--
at
least
has
indicated
and
even
with
respect
to
the
evidence
question,
we
don't
have
that
distinction
that
sometimes
we
think
we
have.
the
concepts
of
evidence
in
the
traditional
common
word
sense
of
a
word,
i
feel
are
breaking
down
somewhat.
after
all
as
the
commentary
has
referred
to
in
our
brief
suggests
the
ultimate
objective
of
the
rules
of
evidence
is
to
find
the
facts.
now,
it
is
true
that
in
an
administrative
proceeding,
the
rules
of
evidence
are
still
much
more
flexible
than
a
court,
but
litigants
before
the
federal
trade
commission
except
for
the
evidence
admissibility
question
is
completely
protected.
the
rules
and
procedure
prescribed
by
the
federal
trade
commission
limit
the
kind
of
evidence
that
maybe
received
to
relevant
evidence
to
non-prejudicial
evidence.
he
has
accorded
the
right
to
take
the
deposition.
he
has
accorded
the
right
to
cross-examine.
finally
of
course,
the
–
if
the
federal
trade
commission
order
is
ultimately
construed
to
come
within
section
5
(a)
of
the
clayton
act,
such
an
application
or
such
a
holding
would
mean
nearly
that
it
is
prima
facie
admissible
and
not
conclusively
binding.
the
court
in
the
brunswick
case
was
not
concerned
with
the
obvious
constitutional
implications
and
its
holding.
a
federal
trade
commission
which
has
now
urged
to
congress
that
section
5
(a)
be
specifically
amended
in
language
that
is
referred
to
in
our
brief,
to
include
federal
trade
commission
proceedings
within
section
5
(a)
apparently
is
not
bothered
by
these
constitutional
problems,
at
least
there
is
no
suggestion
of
any
concern
along
those
lines.
and
finally,
--
mr.
albert
g.
besser
i
think
that's
true
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i
--
i
think
that
judge
wyzanski's
expression
has
been
as
close
as
we
can
find,
indication
that
in
an
equity
case
a
federal
judge
will
relax
the
traditional
standards
of
evidence.
but
--.
mr.
albert
g.
besser
that's
true
your
honor.
that's
true.
mr.
albert
g.
besser
oh,
no
question
about.
mr.
albert
g.
besser
that's
very
true.
mr.
albert
g.
besser
that's
very
true.
that's
right
and
the
evidence
which
he
will
received
during
the
course
of
this
hearing.
i
think
though
that
even
with
respect
to
section
5
(a)
would
be
a
unwarranted
to
have
the
overall
objective
of
the
act
not
considered
in
–
just
because
of
these
admittedly
different
approaches
by
the
fact
finder
federal
trade
commission
on
a
one
hand
and
a
federal
district
court
on
the
other,
incidentally
with
--
mr.
albert
g.
besser
well,
that
argument
mr.
justice
harlan,
of
course,
is
traditionally
made
i
imagine
in
every
case
where
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
is
presented
to
the
court
with
respect
to
which
there
is
no
precise
judicial
precedents.
i
do
not
agree
with
the
though
that
our
position
in
any
way
is
opposed
to
congressional
policy
as
enunciated
in
1914
and
further
evolved
over
the
years.
i
would
agree
and
nobody
can
again
say
the
argument
that
it
is
not
the
function
of
the
courts
to
change
policy
when
it
has
been
clearly
enunciated.
here,
i
think
the
most
that
can
be
said
about
congressional
policy
is
that
this
precise
question,
namely
the
tolling
question
was
never
specifically
considered
by
congress.
now,
we
feel
our
approach
is
consistent,
but
the
overall
policy
of
congress
which
has
been
enunciated.
i
would
like
very
briefly
to
touch
on
an
issue
in
this
case
which
is
of
a
critical
importance
to
new
jersey
wood,
namely
the
question,
assuming
that
the
federal
trade
commission
proceeding
instituted
under
section
7
of
clayton
act,
it
does
toll
the
statute
the
limitation?
does
it
toll
as
we
contend
our
private
rights
of
action
under
not
only
the
clayton
act
but
under
the
sherman
act
as
well?
and
here,
once
again,
i
feel
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
beyond
the
language
of
section
5
(b)
itself
which
says
that
the
statute
shall
be
tolled
with
respect
to
every
matter
complained
of,
shall
be
toll
with
respect
to
every
private
right
of
action
the
we
have
based
in
whole
or
in
part
on
every
matter
complained
of
in
the
predecessor
government
proceeding.
in
a
nisley
case,
judge
murrah
had
this
problem
before
him
and
there
was
an
attempt
by
the
defendant
there
to
argue
to
the
court
that
the
particular
cause
of
action
alleged
by
the
private
litigant
was
based
on
facts
that
was
somewhat
different
non-theories
of
recovery
that
were
somewhat
different
from
the
theories
and
facts
advanced
in
the
prior
department
of
justice
initiate
a
proceeding.
and
then
in
the
twentieth
century
case
also
cited
in
our
brief
and
indeed
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
the
same
basic
argument
was
made
by
a
defendant.
and
in
each
case,
the
court
held
that
all
that
is
required
is
that
there
be
in
a
words
of
a
twentieth
century
case
a
substantial
identity
and
then
a
words
of
a
nisley
case,
a
substantial
similarity
between
the
facts
alleged
and
the
government
proceeding
and
those
alleged
of
by
the
private
litigant.
but
once
again,
we
come
back
to
the
proposition
that
so
far
as
the
difficult
private
litigant
is
concerned
he
is
not
sophisticated
in
this
area
and
when
the
government
initiates
the
proceeding
under
section
7
with
one
objective
of
requiring
minnesota
mining
to
divest
itself
of
iwi,
all
he
knows
is
that
the
government
is
proceeded
and
has
as
a
subjective
something
that
he
would
like
to
see
accomplished.
now,
whether
sherman
act
theories
or
clayton
act
theories
are
involved,
we
feel
are
not
important.
the
obvious
result
of
a
contention
of
minnesota
mining
in
this
case
would
be,
once
again,
to
require
every
litigant
to
immediately
initiate
a
civil
suit
because
he
might
find
out
that
once
he
finally
did
get
around
to
suing
the
precise
causes
of
action
upon
which
he
bases
his
complaint,
do
not
fall
into
the
legal
mode,
the
conceptualistic
mode
upon
which
the
earlier
government
proceeding
was
based.
mr.
albert
g.
besser
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
the
only
way
to
feel
the
sections
i
and
2
violations,
of
course,
is
when
it
alleges
that
what
constitute
--
when
it
alleges
unfair
trade
practice
under
section
5
and
there
of
course,
it
has
been
held
by
this
court
many
times
that
there
is
no
reason
why
under
the
guides
of
section
5,
the
commission
cannot
proceed
against
practices
which
in
themselves
are
a
violative
of
the
sherman
act.
i
would
point
out
that
--
mr.
albert
g.
besser
i
think
your
honor,
mr.
justice
black,
so
held
in
the
--
mr.
albert
g.
besser
--
since
i
believe
you
in
which
you
pointed
out
that
i
think
the
reasoning
is
this
that
every
action
is
--
that
every
unfair
trade
practice
under
section
5
need
not
necessarily
be
a
violation
under
section
1
and
section
2
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
albert
g.
besser
i
think
if
your
honor
please,
that
the
bar
has
come
to
accept
this
distinction
without
to
much
difficulty.
mr.
albert
g.
besser
oh!
well
it
has
caused
some
difficulties
so
far
as
approach
is
concerned.
mr.
albert
g.
besser
section
7.
mr.
albert
g.
besser
no
question
about
it.
the
federal
trade
commission
did
not
proceed
in
this
case
under
section
5
but
a
basic
comparison
of
the
allegations
in
the
federal
trade
commission
complaint
show
that
the
basic
facts
alleged
in
that
complaint
are
almost
identical
with
the
basic
facts
in
our
case.
mr.
albert
g.
besser
mr.
justice
black,
i
think,
he's
just
head
on
one
of
the
most
significant
anomalies
left
by
the
decisions
below
which
is
that
if
the
ftc
proceeds
under
its
own
act
to
readdress
what
is
essentially
a
sherman
act
violation
there
can
be
no
question
of
tolling
are
no
question
of
admissibility
at
all.
now,
lastly
i
would
like
to
leave
with
you
one
thought
and
that
is
simply
that
this
policy,
for
which
my
adversary
fights,
he
doesn't
need
in
this
case.
he
is
trying
to
save
a
lawsuit
that
he
forgot
–
his
client
forgot
to
bring
in
the
time
provided
by
congress
and
the
policy
for
which
he
fights
is
singularly
ill
designed
and
ill
considered
to
be
handled
in
this
type
of
ad
hoc
administration.
if
what
they
want
are
those
leads
to
evidence,
tolling
is
not
the
policy
that
will
produce
it.
tolling
will
have
only
incidental
impact
in
the
whole
policy
area.
what
they
can
get,
they
can
get
now
by
suing
at
the
same
time
that
the
trade
commission
proceeding
is
going
on.
as
is
the
case
in
the
highland
situation
where
that
trade
proceeding
is
still
pending.
secondly,
we
have
the
problems
inherent
in
administrative
proceedings
and
confidentiality
of
material's
furnished
to
government
agencies
that
are
prosecuting
antitrust
violation.
there
is
where
the
policy
should
be
attacked
if
it
is
to
become
a
policy.
