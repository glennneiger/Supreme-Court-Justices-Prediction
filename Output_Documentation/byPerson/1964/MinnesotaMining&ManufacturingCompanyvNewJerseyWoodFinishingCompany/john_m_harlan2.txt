may

that
the

circuit
(inaudible)?
justice
john
m.

(inaudible)
justice
john

i'm
passing
the
record
to
them
sir.
now,
the
1959
finality
act
is
difficult
to
argue
for
me
in
this
case
because
it
has
been
dealt
with
differently
by
all
of
various
persons
that
have
had
a
hand
and
disagreed
with
me
up
to
this
point.
the
district
court
ignored
it.
the
third
circuit
found
the
fundamental
thing.
this
was
the
act
that
really
counted
and
changed.
going
back
to
the
original
language,
what
did
congress
mean
by
a
proceeding
inequity
as
to
third
circuit?
it
meant
the
review
of
trade
commission
action
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
sat
as
a
court
of
equity
and
actually
pronounced
the
final
judgment
or
decree
in
the
particular
case
prosecuted
by
the
commission.
so,
therefore
said
the
third
circuit,
the
finality
act
when
it
came
in,
moved
that
equity
proceeding
back
into
the
commission
itself.
and
the
commission
proceeding
now
is
something
like
or
essentially
the
same
as
the
proceeding
in
a
court
of
equity.
now,
my
associate,
mr.
mcamis'
constantly
reminds
me
that
at
least
in
terms
of
pure
logic
if
you
say
that
something
is
essentially
the
same
or
is
quite
like
or
is
all
but,
you're
saying
that
it
nevertheless
it
is
something
different
still.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
the
reference
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
in
64
columbia
390
and
of
course,
your
honors,
as
i
was
waiting
for
this
case
to
reached,
i
heard
the
presentations
in
the
mca
case
just
the
other
day
which
regardless
of
the
merits
there,
illustrates
that
there
are
certain
things
that
do
happen
in
administrative
agencies
that
do
not
happen
in
judicial
proceedings
and
cannot
happen
but
the
point
remains
that
the
anomaly
which
my
opponents
refuse
to
recognize
is
that
that
which
could
not
be
might
not
be
evidenced
becomes
evidence
by
statutory
file
and
is
imposed
upon
me.
i
have
no
real
remedy
against
it
the
despite
the
argument
of
the
third
circuit
that
they
are
not
really
going
hurt
me
too
badly,
by
letting
this
in
because
i
can
always
i
argue
the
way
of
the
others.
i
can't
show
however,
if
this
is
truly
prima
facie
evidence,
that
the
findings
of
the
commission
were
developed
through
opinion
testimony
of
non-experts,
statistical
compilations
rather
than
real
evidence,
of
hearsay,
of
any
of
the
other
things
which
by
their
expertise
at
least
the
theory
runs,
agents,
administrative
agency
can
construct
a
record
and
make
findings
and
decisions.
and
finally,
decisions
which
are
designed
not
to
punish,
not
to
assess
fault
for
past
conduct.
but
decisions
that
are
to
operate
prospectively
and
in
the
future
to
alee
practices
which
might
burgeon
into
sherman
act
conspiracies
or
per
se
violations
of
the
act.
this
is
the
concern
of
the
agency
rather
than
the
corrective
action,
punitive
action
taken
first
by
the
attorney
general
in
a
government
action
and
secondly,
through
highly
punitive
treble-damage
action.
so,
we
do
argue
that
really
the
whole
difference
between
the
court
and
the
federal
trade
commission
proceedings
can
be
summed
up
and
the
overwriting
policies
of
prevention
of
wrongs
--
our
future
wrongs
and
in
the
correction
and
punishment
of
established
wrongs.
and
that
these
are
fundamental
policies
rather
ignored
by
the
opposition.
i
would
like
to
point
also
that
in
my
judgment,
the
solicitor
general's
view
of
the
policy
sufferers
from
two
basic
misapprehensions.
i
think
the
first
one,
i've
already
averted
to
that
congress
wanted
private
plaintiffs
to
have
facts
develop
by
government
resources
as
amply
belied
by
the
legislative
history.
but
the
second
assumption
not
stated
but
the
unarticulated
assumption
of
the
policy
position
advanced
by
the
solicitor
general
and
i
assumed
concurred
in
by
my
opponent
is
that
every
antitrust
defendant,
once
charged,
must
be
guilty
of
something.
there
must
be
some
facts
of
which
he
is
so
ashamed
that
can
be
used
against
him
in
future
litigation.
and
therefore,
it's
a
worthy
policy
to
hold
and
assure
that
perspective
plaintiffs
will
get
that
access
to
those
facts
even
though
he
maybe
exonerated
in
the
government
proceedings.
now,
the
solicitor
general
finds
that
there's
no
reason
for
the
point
of
fairness
to
the
defendant
not
to
establish
this
policy.
but
i
point
out
that
in
this
case,
the
divestiture
order
to
which
3m
consented
necessarily
divested
3m
of
the
very
ability
to
defend
itself
against
the
action
brought
by
new
jersey
wood.
we
lost,
we
divested
ourselves
with
the
personnel,
and
the
record,
and
the
evidence
that
we
need
in
that
case.
secondly,
we
now
face
a
punitive
action,
a
treble-damage
action,
not
simple
a
remedial
action
solvable
by
divestiture
not
of
both
or
all
the
acquisitions
that
the
trade
commissions
is
concerned
of
but
by
one.
the
trade
commission
accepted
something
far
less
half-a-loaf
in
this
case.
we
face
a
different
substantive
charge,
instead
of
clayton
act
section
7,
we
now
face
the
sherman
act
conspiracy,
and
we've
lost
our
co-tortfeasor
because
he
is
out.
essex
wire
is
not
broad
in
this
case.
since
he
had
not
been
a
party
with
trade
commission
proceedings,
essex
wire
stand
outside
this
case,
insulated
from
the
charge
that
new
jersey
wood
would
makes
against
us.
and
we
are
of
course
changing
the
ground
rules
and
mid-stream
in
a
particular
litigation.
suggesting
as
to
why
whether
or
not
we
would
have
taken
this
settlement.
was
it
consideration
on
the
part
of
3m
that
the
statute
having
run,
it
could
settle
this
case
and
this
would
be
the
end
of
the
entire
matter
of
its
acquisition
of
iwi.
we
suggest
that
therefore
there's
a
policy
here
of
government
settlements,
reducing
settlements
that
ought
to
be
protected.
and
finally,
the
solicitor
general's
reliance
on
the
burnett
case
decided
by
this
court
in
the
first
week
in
april,
as
we
analyzed
in
our
brief
seems
to
be
completely
an
opposite
to
the
situation.
that
case
found
the
line
of
cases
that
says,
â€œwhere
the
plaintiffs
does
not
sleep
on
his
rights,
where
the
plaintiff
acts
diligently
and
does
what
he
can
or
is
foreclosed
from
acting
through
some
circumstance
beyond
his
control
such
as
war
or
is
induced
to
waive
his
rights
by
some
wrong
doing
by
the
defendant.
that's
as
i
read
mr.
justice
goldberg's
opinion
is
the
true
meaning
of
the
burnett
case
and
it
cannot
possibly
be
dragged
to
cover
this
situation.
now
my
time
is
expiring,
i
will
make
only
a
reference
to
our
final
point
which
is
that
--
even
if
this
court
agrees
with
the
decision
below,
you
will
then
have
to
say
second
question.
thus,
the
tolling
--
on
account
of
this
clayton
act
proceeding
of
the
trade
commission
does
that
tolling
also
cover
the
sherman
act
claims
that
are
now
advanced
against
us.
and
i
just
want
to
point
out
that,
this
is
not
semantic
argument
between
me
and
my
adversary.
it
leads
to
the
next
argument
in
this
case
which
is
that
if
sherman
act
is
out
of
the
case
under
the
statute
of
limitations,
this
plaintiff
must
proceeds
solely
on
the
clayton
act
and
we
question
and
cite
some
authorities
to
you,
the
district
court
authorities
that
indicate
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
section
7
of
clayton
act
does
provide
an
action
for
treble-damages
in
the
first
instance.
obviously,
it
does
for
injunctive
relief.
there
have
been
many
cases
on
that
but
there
has
never
been
a
case
to
our
knowledge
in
which
plaintiff
is
successfully
prosecuted
in
treble-damages
action
under
section
7.
we
ask
therefore
that
the
decisions
below
be
reconsidered
and
reversed.
thank
you,
your
honor.
