mr.
sidney
p.
howell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents,
i
believe
for
the
first
time,
an
occasion
by
which
this
court
may
construe
one
of
the
truly
unique
features
of
the
clayton
act,
namely,
section
5,
which
has
been
various
forms
on
the
books
since
1914.
section
5
of
the
clayton
act
has
two
features.
the
first,
and
we
will
argue
the
dominant
concern
of
congress
at
the
time
of
this
enactment,
is
that
phrase
now
in
section
5
(a)
relating
and
providing
for
the
admissibility
and
subsequent
private
treble-damage
litigation
of
the
final
judgment
or
decree
secured
in
any
civil
or
criminal
proceeding
instituted
by
the
government.
it
is
somewhat
less
unique
feature,
i
used
the
word
unique
since
the
first
feature
to
which
i've
just
referred
the
admissibility
is
prima
facie
evidence,
obviously
works
a
drastic
change
on
the
prevailing
common
law
notions
of
mutuality
of
the
stock
by
statute.
the
second
feature
and
the
one
with
which
we
are
directly
concerned
on
this
appeal,
is
the
provision
of
section
5
(b)
providing
that
during
dependency
of
any
such
civil
or
criminal
proceeding
instituted
by
the
united
states,
all
right
of
action
created
by
section
4
of
the
act
for
private
litigants
shall
be
suspended.
the
statute
of
limitation,
otherwise,
pertaining
to
such
private
causes
of
action
will
be
suspended.
now,
the
specific
question
in
this
case
is
whether
dependency
of
a
federal
trade
commission
proceeding,
the
proceeding
instituted
to
enforce
the
anti-trust
laws
as
defined
in
the
clayton
act,
is
such
a
civil
or
criminal
proceeding
as
by
the
united
states
as
will
suspend
or
toll
the
statute
limitations.
the
courts
below
have
both
answered
this
question
in
the
affirmative
and
have
held
that
the
plaintiff's
complaint
below
was
therefore
not
timed
barred
by
section
4.
three
district
courts
which
have
considered
the
same
problem
since
this
problem
was
considered
by
the
district
court
of
the
new
jersey
in
this
action.
mr.
sidney
p.
howell,
jr.
the
action
was
instituted
five
years
and
three
months
after
the
institution
--
after
the
single
cardinal
event
which
they
say
their
right
spring
from
namely,
the
acquisition
by
this
petitioner,
minnesota
mining
and
manufacturing
company
of
a
distributor
through
whom
this
plaintiff
below
distributed
his
products.
the
acquisition
was
in
august
of
1956.
the
complaint
in
this
action
was
filed
in
november
of
1961.
the
district
courts,
as
i
say
in
missouri,
tennessee,
and
particularly,
at
least
i
commend
the
opinion
particularly
to
you
of
judge
who
knew
in
the
district
court
of
maine,
all
followed
upon
the
decision
of
this
court
as
other
plaintiffs
raised
the
same
question
as
to
whether
or
not
various
aspects
of
their
causes
of
action
had
been
saved
by
the
suspension
of
the
limitations
during
dependency
of
commission
proceedings
in
those
cases.
the
highland
supply
case
in
missouri
went
up
to
the
eighth
circuit
and
was
there
affirmed
bringing
it
into
direct
conflict
with
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court
here.
now,
i
have
no
explanation
as
real
explanation
as
to
why
it
is
taking
50
years
for
this
particularly
narrow
and
almost
that
it
would
seem
from
the
briefing
i've
read
obvious
question
to
arise
in
this
court.
except
and
i
think
an
obvious
practical
construction
has
been
placed
on
section
5
over
the
years.
not
only
by
practitioners
in
the
field
by
the
bench,
the
bar,
and
all
commentators
who
have
ever
considered
this
question
in
any
aspect.
no
one,
no
one
has
ever
before
advanced
the
fly
that
the
federal
trade
commission
proceeding
was
such
a
proceeding
as
is
comprehended
by
section
5
of
the
clayton
act.
now,
the
question
is
here
now
and
it
arose
in
the
following
manner.
petitioner
minnesota
mining
defended
below,
we
quite
often
refer
to
as
“3m”,
among
many
other
diversified
facets
is
a
manufacturer
and
distributor
of
electrical
insulation
materials.
prior
to
1953,
its
principal
product
line
was
electrical
installation
tape
which
had
sold
to
original
equipment
manufacturers
and
to
distributors
for
resale.
again,
original
equipment
manufacturers
and
to
repair
in
rewind
shops.
in
june
of
1960,
the
federal
trade
commission
issued
a
complaint
under
section
7
of
clayton
act
which
referred
to
a
series
of
acquisitions
made
by
3m
in
the
years
from
'53
to
'55
as
some
six
manufacturers
of
other
electrical
insulation
product
lines.
it
then
made
particular
reference
in
this
complaint
to
its
acquisition
in
march
of
1956
of
the
prayor
(ph)
company,
a
distributor
the
second
largest,
i
believe
with
the
allegations,
second
largest
distributor
of
electrical
installation
products
located
principally
in
edmund
western
states
and
then,
to
its
subsequent
acquisition
in
august
of
1956
of
the
assets
of
“iwi”,
which
we
quote
for
the
moment
the
actual
name
slips
my
mind.
it's
been
so
long
since
i
forgot
it,
iwi,
being
a
national
distributor
of
electrical
insulation
products,
and
possessing
roughly
14%
of
the
market,
and
alleged
to
have
been
the
third
largest.
mr.
sidney
p.
howell,
jr.
no.
irvington
varnish
is
one
of
the
manufacturers,
mr.
justice
stewart.
it's
installation
and
wires,
inc.
mr.
sidney
p.
howell,
jr.
--
which
was
the
distributor.
and
the
acquisition
was
made
as
it
happens
from
the
co-defendant
below
essex
wire
company.
now,
this
complaint
and
i
chant
well
of
it,
i
think
obviously
it
must
speak
for
itself
in
the
record
of
this
case.
it
was
in
the
record
below.
it
seems
to
me
quite
obviously,
directed
toward
what
the
commission
as
referred
to
as
the
“acquisitive
appetite”,
displayed
by
3m
in
their
judgments
and
that
their
concern
was
primarily
to
this
fact
that
3m
had
acquired
--
made
two
such
acquisitions
of
distributors
and
having
vertically
--
in
an
attempt
to
vertically
integrate
the
market.
the
allegation
was
of
course,
that
those
acquisitions
might
tend
to
substantially
lessen
competition
or
create
a
monopoly
in
the
manufacturer
--
distribution
of
sale
of
electrical
insulation
materials
and
in
violation
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
no
other
antitrust
law
was
involved.
there
was
no
reference
to
any
sherman
act
theory
under
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
it
was
simply
a
clayton
act
proceeding.
thirteen
months
later
in
july
of
1961,
3m
and
the
commission
entered
to
a
consent
order
before
the
taking
of
any
evidence.
this
order,
which
also
appears
in
the
record,
provided
that
directed
3m
to
divest
itself
of
iwi.
it
was
permitted
to
retain
the
prayor
(ph)
company.
in
fact,
there
was
a
dismissal
of
the
section
7
charge
provided
as
to
the
prayor
(ph)
company
with
the
single
exception
of
assuring
and
requiring
3m
to
purchase
--
to
permit
prayor
(ph)
to
purchase
certain
electrical
installation
but
at
to
a
certain
percentage
--
the
electrical
installation
requirements
from
suppliers
other
than
3m.
on
november
20,
1961,
as
i
say
mr.
justice
stewart,
some
five
years
and
three
months
after
the
acquisition
of
iwi,
new
jersey
wood
finishing
company
instituted
a
treble-damage
action
in
the
district
court
of
new
jersey.
new
jersey
wood
finishing
company
is
a
manufacturer
and
distributor
of
a
line
--
of
electrical
insulation
materials
for
purposes
of
this
case
fully
competitive
with
the
line
offered
by
3m.
this
complaint,
and
i
might
mention
that
we
deal
here
more
or
less
by
consent
of
everybody
in
concurrence
of
the
courts
below
with
the
amended
complaint
which
was
filed
in
march
of
1963,
it
appeared
from
the
record,
states
two
causes
of
action.
first,
that
3m,
violation
of
the
sherman
act,
both
sections
1
and
2,
entered
into
an
agreement
with
essex
wire
illustrate
of
trade
and
agreeing
to
purchase
iwi.
and
constructed
a
monopoly
in
violation
of
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
in
the
sale
and
distribution
of
electrical
installation
materials
to
the
damage
of
this
particular
plaintiff
by
foreclosing
him
what
previously
sold
to
his
products
through
iwi
from
a
substantial
share
of
the
market.
now,
this
complaint
specifically
alleges
that
3m
advised
new
jersey
wood
in
september
of
1956,
that
after
january
of
'57,
it
would
no
longer
purchase
any
electrical
insulation
materials
from
new
jersey
wood.
we
took
their
positions
in
this
case
to
assure
ourselves
that
there
would
be
no
claim
of
fraudulent
concealment
of
the
cause
of
action
and
that
to
confirm
that
particular
allegation
of
the
complaint
that
new
jersey
wood
had
full
knowledge
of
the
acquisition
and
of
the
import
of
that
acquisition
upon
its
own
business
as
early
as
september
of
1956,
and
that
that
impact
would
be
fully
felt
by
january
of
1957.
having
taken
that
step,
we
then
moved
in
the
district
court
to
dismiss
the
complaint
or
for
summary
judgment
under
section
4
(b)
of
the
clayton
act
the
--
then
recently
enacted
four
years
statute
of
limitations
governing
all
private
treble-damage
actions.
the
judge
countered
--
with
the
argument
that
the
statute
of
limitations
had
been
suspended
under
section
5
(b).
i
don't
mean
to
be
pedantic
but
i
think
it
will
profit
us
if
i
briefly
read
section
5,
as
we
faced
it
in
this
case.
section
5
(a)
provides
the
final
judgment
or
decree
and
i
will
read
elliptically,
“rendered
in
any
civil
or
criminal
proceeding
brought
by
or
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
under
the
antitrust
laws
to
the
effect
that
a
defendant
has
violated
set
laws
shall
be
prima
facie
evidence
against
such
defendant,
in
any
action
or
proceeding
brought
by
any
party
or
other
party
against
such
defendant
as
to
all
matters
respecting
which
said
judgment
or
decree
would
be
an
estoppel
as
between
the
parties.”
whenever
any
civil
or
criminal
proceeding
is
instituted
by
the
united
states
to
prevent,
restrain
or
punish
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws,
the
statute
of
limitation,
in
respect
of
very
private
right
of
action
arising
under
set
laws
have
based
in
whole
or
in
part
on
any
matter
complaint
of
the
said
proceeding
shall
be
suspended
during
dependency
thereof
and
for
one
year
thereafter.
the
district
court
found
briefly
that
these
two
sections
were
separate
and
apart
had
no
relationship
necessary
relationship
to
each
other
and
that
an
ftc
proceeding
is
and
i
quote,
“an
action
by
the
united
states”,
and
the
congress
intended
and
adopting
that
suspension
provision
that
prospective
private
treble-damage
plaintiffs
would
get
not
just
the
benefit
of
the
final
--
of
the
admissibility
as
prima
facie
evidence
of
the
final
judgment
or
decree
as
provided
in
section
5
(a)
but
also
of
all
facts
adduced
by
the
government
in
the
course
of
prosecuting
that
action.
the
district
court
held
that
it
could
not
believe
it
logical.
that
a
private
plaintiff's
rights
would
depend
on
what
he
termed
the
fortuitous
circumstance
of
which
government
agency
prosecuted
the
antitrust
violation.
there
he
had
reference
of
course,
to
the
fact
that
the
clayton
act
envisions
concurrent
enforcement,
remedies
at
the
hands
of
either
the
department
of
justice
or
the
federal
trade
commission.
now,
the
third
circuit
is
in
the
unanimous
opinion
by
judge
mclaughlin,
chief
judge
biggs,
and
judge
hasting
concurring
agreed
that
judge
gallup
(ph)
to
a
point.
first,
that
the
ftc
and
their
view
is
truly
a
representative
of
the
united
states
specifically
empowered
to
enforce
the
clayton
act.
and
that
a
federal
trade
proceeding
should
not
create
an
anomaly
in
the
enforcement
scheme
constructed
by
congress
and
its
plan
for
effective
antitrust
enforcement
aided
by
private
litigation.
therefore
as
the
third
circuit,
the
rights
created
by
section
4
to
bring
these
private
treble-damage
actions
are
preserved
by
any
government
action
under
section
5
(b)
whether
that
action
by
the
department
of
justice
or
by
the
trade
commission.
this
led
the
third
circuit
to
take
the
obvious
and
less
logical
step
that
since
the
language
in
section
5
(b)
is
so
identical,
so
closely
identified
with
the
language
of
5
(a)
that
a
federal
trade
commission
proceeding
or
rather
the
judgment
or
decree,
if
you
will,
the
cease-and-desist
order
of
the
trade
commission
would
indeed
be
admissible
as
prima
facie
evidence
in
subsequent
private
treble-damage
litigation.
the
third
circuit
held
that
they
saw
no
reason
why
they
shouldn't
be
the
result.
since,
first,
after
all
the
decree
or
the
order
would
only
be
prima
facie
evidence
--
that
the
differences
between
an
equity
proceeding
conducted
by
the
attorney
general
in
the
federal
courts
and
a
trade
commission
proceeding
were
only
peripheral,
and
that
any
--
that
the
defendant
would
have
the
right
to
argue
the
weight
and
prohibitive
value
of
the
evidence
offered
to
the
decree.
it
then
suggested
that
besides
prima
facie
evidence
only
has
limited
value
in
the
prosecution
of
private
action.
not
only
the
court
suggested
that
certain
amendments
to
section
5
to
which
i
shall
refer,
adopted
by
congress
in
1955,
plainly
intimated.
i'm
not
so
sure
how
you
can
plainly
intimate
but
plainly
intimated
that
a
broader
purpose
was
indeed
apprehended
by
section
b,
the
holding
section,
then
in
the
section
a,
the
admissibility
section.
that
this
broader
purpose
did
indeed
assure
to
prospective
plaintiffs
that
they
would
gain
not
just
that
final
order
but
all
the
evidence
adduced
by
the
agency
in
the
process
of
prosecuting
the
case.
the
court
had
no
difficulty
distinguishing
the
district
court
cases
and
by
this
time,
the
eighth
circuit
opinion,
which
i
have
referred
to
before
as
direct
conflict
with
the
district
court
of
new
jersey
holding
that
those
--
they
had
placed
too
much
reliance
on
the
1923
district
court
case,
proper
again
john
bene,
the
only
case
that
had
really
considered
the
admissibility
feature
of
the
act
and
they
had
overlooked
the
affirmative
statutory
distinctions
between
the
federal
trade
commission
act
and
the
clayton
act
with
the
concurrent
effect
on
the
sections
which
we're
discussing.
finally,
the
verdict
to
--
the
increased
power
which
has
been
granted
by
congress
to
the
trade
commission
in
the
recent
years
and
then,
referred
to
the
second
circuit's
decision
in
brunswick
bark
in
the
decision
of
1946
which
is
discussed
the
great
length
in
the
briefs
on
both
sides.
i'm
not
going
to
rehash
it
except
that
it
does
stand
as
a
problem
and
i
think
a
problem
from
both
sides
in
this
appeal.
the
second
circuit
had
the
question
of
admissibility
of
a
federal
trade
commission
order
in
the
treble-damage
action.
at
first,
they
announced
the
decision,
two
to
one
decision
--
with
the
dissent
by
judge
evans
saying
that,
it
would
be
admitted
because
of
the
finality
act
and
removed
all
impediments
to
considering
a
federal
trade
commission
cease-and-desist
order,
a
final
judgment
or
decree.
it
was
later
brought
to
the
court's
attention
that
the
final
--
that
the
–
wheeler-lea
act
had
not
covered
clayton
act
proceedings
--
clayton
act
cease-and-desist
orders
but
only
orders
issued
under
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
that
being
so,
the
second
circuit
withdrew
its
opinion
and
of
course,
the
order
was
not
admitted
in
that
case
and
to
my
knowledge
has
never
come
so
close
to
being
admitted
in
any
case
either
before
or
since.
we
frankly
charge
the
brunswick
bark
case
of
the
second
circuit
as
being
sporadic.
we
do
not
believe
that
it
represents
the
law
as
it
was
then
or
as
it
is
now
and
--
mr.
sidney
p.
howell,
jr.
1946,
your
honor.
and
the
finality
act
and
the
first
amendments
that
we're
going
to
consider
came
in
1955
and
the
finality
act
has
the
clayton
act
orders
of
the
federal
trade
commission
came
in
1959.
the
argument,
of
course,
is
that
the
1959,
finality
act
revitalized
the
principles
enunciated
in
the
rationale
of
the
second
circuit
in
brunswick
bark.
now,
we
have
here
the
briefs
as
amicus
of
the
solicitor
general
giving
the
views
of
the
government
on
this
problem
and
arguing
that
an
underlying
policy
which
is
the
same
policy
suggested
by
the
rationale
in
the
courts
below
of
warranting
two
prospective
plaintiffs,
the
facts
and
leads
to
evidence
developed
in
the
course
of
a
trade
commission
proceeding.
that
this
policy
was
so
clear
in
congress
deliberations
apparently
in
1914
has
to
be
ignored
and
that,
therefore,
that
this
purpose
--
this
congressional
purpose
certainly
must
have
been
meant
to
apply
the
federal
trade
commission
proceedings,
whether
or
not,
and
this
is
a
direct
quote
‘whether
or
not
the
language
of
section
5
covers
federal
trade
commission's
proceedings
or
not'.
now,
i
submit
it
still
an
interesting
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
language
does
cover
federal
trade
commission
proceedings
and
we
do
argue
precisely
that
point.
section
5
to
us
is
obviously
interrogation
of
the
statute
of
limitations
which
prevailed
up
until
the
enactment
of
the
clayton
act's
statute
of
limitations
namely,
each
state
decided
--
each
federal
court
applied
the
law
of
the
state
in
which
it
set
to
the
treble-damage
litigation
until
1955
when
we
got
our
four-year
federal
statute.
and
we
say
that
in
determining
whether
or
not
trade
commission
proceedings
are
within
this
section
and
for
the
moment,
irrespective
of
whether
these
sections
can
be
applied
separately
and
to
different
situations.
i'm
not
dealing
with
that
but
in
reading
section
5
(b)
and
in
understanding
section
5
(b),
it
is
not
only
fair
but
highly
warranted
that
we
look
back
to
5
(a)
to
see
if
it
casts
any
additional
light
on
the
formulation
that
congress
used.
now,
the
formulation
that's
before
as
here
and
which
i
read
before
is
the
statute
as
amended
in
1955.
the
original
language
and
of
the
phrase
‘any
civil
or
criminal
proceeding
as
adopted
by
congress
in
1914
and
modified
in
1955,
was
any
criminal
prosecution
or
in
any
suit
or
proceeding
in
equity'.
now
--
well,
a
solicitor
general
tells
us
that
there
are
serious
obstacles
to
approving
a
results
achieved
below
and
that
5
(b)
did
run
along
under
the
legislative
history
clearly
with
the
enactment
of
5
(a).
he
does
rule
that
5
(a),
the
admissibility;
the
prima
facie
evidence
provision,
did
not
--
was
not
meant
to
and
should
not
as
a
matter
of
policy
be
read
to
cover
federal
trade
commission
proceedings.
i
suppose
technically,
it
is
arguendo
since
there
isn't
a
question
in
this
case
as
to
whether
or
not
the
consent
order
of
the
trade
commission
in
the
3m
case
would
be
ultimately
admissible.
since
it
was
entered
on
consent,
it
falls
under
5
(a)'s
proviso
that
says,
“you
don't
admit
court's
entered
on
consent.”
so,
i
suppose
a
lot
of
the
discussion
as
to
whether
or
not
this
case
can
reach
that
question
would
be
academic.
mr.
sidney
p.
howell,
jr.
that
the
records
all
reached,
your
honor.
now,
the
language
we
like
to
concentrate
in
these
sections
and
i
will
deal
with
the
post
55
act
of
this
analysis.
is
any
civil
or
criminal
proceeding,
now,
my
friend
for
the
respondent,
never
--
i
don't
believe
once
in
his
brief
uses
the
adjective
‘civil',
although,
the
statute
clearly
does.
he
concerns
himself
only
with
the
word
‘proceeding'.
i
think
the
word
‘civil
proceeding'
must
be
read
as
a
word
of
art
consciously
chosen
by
congress
to
describe
exactly
what
they're
talking
about
and
to
contrast
it
with
criminal
proceeding.
the
other
word,
the
second
word,
that
it
has
been
so
far
ignoring
all
briefs
including
our
own,
i'm
afraid,
is
the
word
‘any',
any
civil
or
criminal
proceedings
of
section
b.
therefore,
and
solely
as
a
guideline
at
the
moment
if
we
go
back
to
a,
we
are
talking
about
a
final
judgment
or
decree
rendered
in
any
civil
proceeding,
since
even
the
solicitor
general
concedes
that
the
final
judgment
or
decree
could
only
be
the
mandate
of
a
court
conducting
as
judicial
proceeding.
it
would
appear
that
the
only
proceeding,
the
‘any'
proceeding,
it
could
be
involved
would
have
to
necessarily
be
a
judicial
proceeding
and
could
not,
could
not
be
a
federal
trade
commission
proceeding.
nor,
may
i
say,
could
it
be
any
of
the
other
proceedings
which
we
have
built
into
our
laws
designed
to
lead
at
least
to
the
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws.
it
could
not
be
a
grand
jury
proceeding.
it
could
not
be
proceedings
under
the
new
antitrust
civil
process
act
under
the
issuance
of
the
civil
investigated
demand
nor
could
it
be
the
broad
call
on
the
federal
trade
commission
under
section
6
(b)
of
that
act
upon
corporations
to
furnish
information
to
the
commission
for
the
analysis
and
perhaps
subsequent
prosecution
of
an
antitrust
violation.
this
it
seems
all
clear
to
us,
yet,
if
the
argument
on
the
other
side
seems
to
us
to
drive
directly
in
that
direction.
there's
no
reason
to
stop
at
this
highly
monitory
and
assumed
purpose
of
congress
is
to
be
effectuated.
why
stop
with
the
federal
trade
commission
proceeding?
it
should
be
any
proceeding
by
the
government
and
could
be
any
proceeding
of
any
nature
by
the
government
designed
to
enforce
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
the
trade
commission
itself
in
its
current
report
suggests
that
it's
supposed
to
appropriate
concern
should
be
in
prevention
of
widespread
industry
practices
which
they
need
to
be
the
violation
of
the
act.
that
therefore
they
will
make
greater
use
of
the
trade
practice
conference.
now,
here
we
would
almost
have
an
instance
in
which
the
statute
of
limitations
would
be
suspended
as
to
an
entire
industry
upon
the
issuance
of
the
cause
of
a
conference
and
who
--
against
whom
would
it
run,
those
who
were
called
or
those
who
responded
and
came
forth
voluntarily
to
that
conference.
now,
we
say
secondly
that
what
is
overlooked
at
the
heart
by
our
opponent,
it
must
necessarily
include
the
solicitor
general
as
an
opponent,
is
that
what
congress
was
doing
in
1914
that
they
gave
them
great
concern
and
developed
90%
of
the
legislative
history
of
subject.
was
they
were
enacting
or
rather
by
statute
changing
a
solidly
established
proposition
of
common
law?
that
if
you
are
going
to
use
as
evidence,
you
had
that
–
it
could
only
be
used
in
an
action
against
the
same
parties
in
which
the
evidence
had
a
reason
--
originally
been
established
and
found
as
a
fact.
this
change
and
the
doctor
of
mutuality
of
estoppel
was
what
concerned
congress
and
how
best
to
do
it?
i'm
not
going
to
belabor.
mr.
sidney
p.
howell,
jr.
surely
sir.
mr.
sidney
p.
howell,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
it's
the
only
time
as
i
say,
this
case
was
the
first
case
in
which
the
tolling
question
was
ever
raised,
so
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
find.
mr.
sidney
p.
howell,
jr.
all
other
cases
filed
with
this
one,
with
the
announcement
of
the
district
court
decision
in
this
case,
motions
were
tried
in
the
missouri,
tennessee,
and
maine
actions.
judge
meredith,
who
ruled
in
the
missouri
case
and
ruled
as
we
contend,
his
decision
was
appealed
immediately
to
the
eight
circuit,
it
was
argued
after
our
case
was
argued
in
the
third
circuit
but
the
decision
came
down
and
was
available
to
the
third
circuit
before
they
announced
their
decision
and
they
do
take
account
in
a
footnote
toward
the
end
of
the
third
circuit
opinions
here
of
the
eight
circuit's
decision.
now,
i
do
want
to
pause
for
just
one
other
point
in
the
actual
parsing
out
of
the
statute
and
suggest
that
your
honors
not
only
looked
for
that
word
final
judgment
or
decree
but
the
fact
that
it's
a
final
judgment
or
decree
against
a
defendant
in
the
words
of
section
5
(a)
and
as
we
know
both
the
parlance
and
the
practice
before
the
trade
commission,
the
defendant
is
called
respondent,
and
then
universally
is
and
i
don't
thinks
it's
a
--
it
might
not
have
been
something
the
congress
would've
been
aware
of
in
1914
but
certainly
in
1955
when
they
took
a
general
stock
taking
of
this
section,
it's
quite
likely
that
they
might
reconsider
the
use
of
the
word
“defendant”,
if
they
were
going
to
put
in
a
reference
to
the
trade
commission
proceeding.
i'm
encouraged
in
this
particular
analysis
incidentally
by
what
congress
did
in
1934
with
the
federal
communications
act.
there
and
the
antitrust
section
of
that
act
providing
that
all
the
antitrust
laws
would
apply
to
the
permit
the
communications
commission
to
conduct
their
inquiries,
said,
whatever
in
any
suit,
action
or
proceeding,
civil
or
criminal
brought
under
the
provisions
of
any
of
said
laws,
antitrust
laws
or
and
any
proceedings
brought
to
enforce
or
review
findings
and
orders
of
the
federal
trade
commission
or
other
governmental
agency.
now,
this
to
me
suggest
that
congress
had
by
at
least
1934
elected
upon
the
phrase,
criminal
or
civil
proceeding,
vice
versa,
civil
or
criminal
proceeding
as
truly
a
word
of
art
that
this
meant
just
what
they
meant
and
that
whenever
they
wanted
to
–
it's
reached
to
go
further,
they
would
specifically
refer
to
an
agency
proceeding,
at
least
they
did
so
in
the
communications
act.
secondly,
i
do
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
phrase
or
rather
requirement
of
the
act
that
the
proceeding
question
must
be
one
instituted
by
the
united
states.
and
to
the
laws
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
analyzed
that
that
again
is
reflective
of
a
word
of
art
used
by
congress
to
mean
the
united
states
as
represented
by
the
department
of
justice
and
not
by
one
of
its
constituent,
corporate
agencies
if
you
will,
which
have
on
many
occasions
stood
on
a
separate
basis
in
many
litigations
from
the
positions
developed
by
the
department
of
justice.
we
do
make
references
to
some
of
those
in
our
brief
and
to
the
cases
which
are
specifically
held
that
action
taken
by
the
federal
trade
commission
does
not
act
in
any
respect
to
estoppel,
the
department
of
justice.
and
we
found
that
in
the
pfizer
case
back
in
my
own
district
in
new
york
and
other
cases
which
i
mentioned
in
the
brief,
some
of
them
quite
recent.
it's
a
problem
that
runs
quickly
into
the
problem
of
a
priority,
jurisdiction
and
the
other
questions
that
come
there
but
necessarily
it
still
follows
that
the
department
of
justice
is
not
yet,
where
it
has
taken
a
contrary
further
additional
or
refined
position
from
that
taken
by
the
commission
staff
has
ever
been
foreclosed
from
advancing
the
argument
to
my
knowledge,
in
an
antirust
case.
now,
i'm
not
going
to
belabor
the
legislative
history,
we've
preferred
to
it
in
our
briefs
at
great
length.
in
fact,
i
might
even
agree
with
mr.
akerman's
brief
as
amicus
in
this
case
in
which
he,
citing
justice
jackson,
says
that,
it's
only
with
great
reluctance
that
we
should
ever
go
into
legislative
history
and
when
we
do
we
ought
to
stop
really
with
the
committee
reports
and
not
weigh
through
the
necessitude
of
debate
on
any
one
issue.
this
--
i'm
strengthened
in
this
thought
also
by
the
fact
that
the
eight
circuit
and
its
in
island
supply
case
and
had
judge
meredith
below,
found
no
necessity
to
go
to
the
legislative
history.
they
found
the
statute
plain
on
its
face,
claim
that
it
did
not
in
any
respect
include
federal
trade
commission
proceedings.
now,
despite
this,
the
legislative
history
which
we've
presented
has
a
number
of
pertinent
points.
i
don't
really
think
it
was
quite
as
necessary
for
my
opponent
to
go
quite
as
far
to
start
those
points
and
to
argue
that
really
--
they
don't
say
what
it
seems
to
be
obvious
that
various
(inaudible)
were
saying
at
that
time.
i
think,
he
and
i
could
probably
agree
that
while
a
legislative
history
certainly
doesn't
help
his
argument
in
any
respect,
it
doesn't
hurt
mine.
the
legislative
history
in
this
case
does
develop
two
or
three
significant
things
that
the
solicitor
general
has
conceded
are
relevant
to
a
reading
of
the
act.
and
i
think
probably
what
an
overall
reading
there's
more
than
anything
else
to
show
that
congress
was
acting
within
a
frame
of
reference
and
it
was
concerned
with
this
estoppel
point
of
view
that
it
was
concerned
with
extending
that
estoppel,
that
the
estoppel
doctored
only
to
the
final
judgment
and
decree
entered
by
a
district
court
in
a
proceeding
instituted
and
prosecuted
by
the
department
of
justice.
i
find
no
basis
for
any
other
reading
--
any
other
frame
of
reference,
in
which
any
man
in
congress
in
1914
was
operating.
this
was
the
exclusive
concern
and
the
exclusive
consideration
that
they
manifested.
there
are
one
or
two
points
that
stand
out.
for
instance,
instead
of
prima
facie
evidence
the
proposal
in
the
house
debates
at
one
time
was
that
it
be,
conclusive
evidence
that
the
final
judgment
or
decree
be
made
conclusive
in
the
subsequent
litigation.
now
all
of
constitutional
doubts
as
to
whether
congress
could
do
that,
that
amendment
was
withdrawn
and
yet,
those
that
advance
the
constitutional
doubts
never
suggested
that
my
word
how
much
more
of
a
constitutional
morass
that
we
entered,
if
we
permit
of
the
idea
that
federal
trade
commission
proceedings
are
somehow
bundled
up
in
this
proposition.
to
me,
that
seems
a
certainly
in
the
context
of
1914
seems
to
have
been
potentially
the
most
telling
argument.
it
could've
been
made
by
those
who
were
successful
and
cutting
back
the
effect
of
the
evidence
to
be
created
from
conclusive
to
prima
facie.
secondly,
one
senator
at
one
point
in
the
senate
debates
advance
the
suggestion
that
the
words
inequity
be
deleted
as
unnecessary
under
the
formulation
as
it
stood
them
before
the
house,
any
criminal
prosecution
or
any
suit
or
proceeding
in
equity.
it
was
immediately
countered
by
--
well,
if
you
do
that
--
if
you
take
out
the
inequity,
you've
eliminated
--
we
could
be
talking
about
any
kind
of
proceeding
and
promptly
that
suggestion
was
withdrawn
and
the
act
did
pass
with
the
inequity
specifications
in
there,
clearly
reflection
of
the
classical
form
of
proceeding
which
we
had
at
that
time,
a
suit
or
proceeding
inequity.
finally,
and
with
direct
reference
to
the
suggestion
now
that
--
by
the
solicitor
general
that
it
was
the
basic,
if
you
will,
the
basic
purpose
of
congress
to
provide
for
all
prospective
plaintiffs
the
evidence
and
the
leads
to
evidence
developed
by
the
government's
fact
finding
resources.
in
that
respect,
a
specific
amendment
was
offered
to
open
the
files
of
the
department
of
justice,
not
the
trade
commission,
but
of
the
department
of
justice
to
anyone
to
rummage
around
and
collect
up
such
cases
he
could
make.
this,
after
debate
was
rejected
and
referred
to
two
or
three
later
times
in
the
debates
as
having
been
put
to
one
side,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
to
ignore
that
development
as
one
of
the
significant
factors
bearing
particularly
on
the
congressional
policy
which
the
solicitor
general
has
ascertained
is
unaccountable
anywhere
in
his
brief.
now
in
1955,
again
congress'
concern
was
not
primarily
with
section
5.
congress
at
this
point
was
adding
to
the
clayton
act,
section
a
which,
4
(a)
i'm
sorry,
section
4
(a)
which
provides
for
a
government
actions
to
collect
single
damages.
the
courts
having
held
that
the
government
could
not
maintain
a
treble-damage
action
under
section
4.
and
secondly
to
add
the
four-year
statute
of
limitations
which
comes
up
as
4
(b)
of
the
clayton
act.
now,
these
amendments
did
require
--
had
to
be
integrated
and
to
be
fit
in
the
section
5.
so,
congress
was
taking
a
look
at
section
5
at
the
same
time.
it
declared
that
it
was
not
attempting
to
make
any
substantive
change
in
section
5
whatsoever.
it
did
change
the
language,
criminal
prosecutions,
suit
or
proceeding
in
equity
through
any
civil
or
criminal
proceeding
language
and
did
so
without
any
particular
comment
in
reports
or
otherwise
other
than
the
comment
that
there
was
to
be
no
substantive
change.
they
did
divide
the
section
into
a-part
and
a
b-part
separately
lettered.
and
they
did
make
the
references
but
now
appeared
through
section
4
(a)
concurrently
adapted.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
--
the
third
circuit
has
attempted
to
find
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
55
enactment,
a
purpose,
a
broader
purpose
and
ever
previously
been
articulated.
the
solicitor
general
doesn't
quite
pin
it
down
to
1955
but
there
is
a
pervasive
congressional
purpose,
however,
unarticulated
to
this
point
that
at
some
point
did
draw
a
trade
commission
proceedings
in
to
section
4
(b).
this,
again,
the
significant
thing
to
me
in
the
55
debates
is
that
what
may
have
been
vague
or
unsaid
before
is
now
directly
said
and
senator
keating
says,
“that
the
present
time,
the
tolling
of
the
statute
with
respective
to
private,
treble-damaged
suit
exists
during
the
pendency
of
a
suit
by
the
united
states.
to
me,
it
could
not
be
more
clear
that
senator
keating
did
not
believe
that
trade
commission
act
proceedings
were
in
any
way
involved
in
the
subject
under
discussion.
it
continues,
the
bill
provides
for
extension
of
the
tolling
period
not
only
for
the
duration
of
the
government
suit
but
also
for
one
year
thereafter.
now,
we
point
out
that
this
particular
proposals
enacted
in
55
had
been
under
debate
since
1950.
they
have
been
debated
again
in
‘51
that
the
chairman
of
the
ftc
himself,
mr.
lowell
mason,
came
in
and
testified
perfectly
consistently
with
senator
keating's
statement
of
the
purpose
of
the
amendments.
it's
very
clear
that
chairman
mason
of
the
commission
had
no
such
view
as
is
advanced
in
this
case.
he
knew
that
trade
commission
proceedings
were
not
under
the
act
and
makes
specific
references
to
criminal
or
injunction
cases
brought
by
the
government.
and
finally,
to
us
it
seems
just
incredible,
that
congress
would
work
after
40
years
such
an
important,
such
a
significant
change
in
the
practical
construction
of
the
law
without
advising
congress,
advising
themselves
in
some
articulated
manner
that
that's
precisely
what
they
were
proposing
to
do.
mr.
sidney
p.
howell,
jr.
the
finality
act
sir,
simply
provided
eliminated
the
three
step
enforcement
proceedings
of
clayton
act
--
of
ftc
clayton
act
proceedings.
previously,
the
clayton
act
would
make
its
determination
and
issue
a
cease
and
desist
order.
that
cease-and-desist
order,
then
to
be
enforced
had
to
be
carried
into
the
circuit
court.
and
the
circuit
court
issued
its
enforcement
order
and
it
was
in
contempt
of
that
order
that
two
prosecutions
result.
and
it
was
the
order
of
the
circuit
court
that
commission
had
to
have
before
it
could
truly
enforce
the
determinations
it
had
made.
this
was
eliminated
and
now
federal
trade
commission
orders
become
final
and
binding
upon
the
respondents
upon
an
expiration
of
the
term
to
appeal
that
the
determination
made
to
the
circuit
court.
this
brought
clayton
act
enforcement
and
this
was
accomplished
by
an
amendment
to
section
11
of
the
clayton
act.
this
brought
clayton
act
enforcement
by
the
commission
into
line
with
the
enforcement
of
its
own
act,
the
federal
trade
commission
act
which
had
been
done
by
an
amendment
made,
of
known
as
the
wheeler-lea
amendment
of
1938.
now,
the
solicitor
general
has
rejected
the
entire
rationale
of
the
third
circuit
on
this
question.
he
says
that,
the
third
circuit
frankly
erred
in
their
analysis
here.
and
that
the
results
that
they
find
in
a
tribute
for
the
finality
act
were
wholly
artificial
in
nature
and
certainly
a
result
never
suggested
by
congress.
and
finally,
the
solicitor
general
at
this
point
argues
that
it
would
be
a
very
unwise
policy
for
this
court
to
attribute
the
status
of
a
final
judgment
or
decree
to
federal
trade
commission
proceedings
for
purposes
of
creating
prima
facie
evidence
usable
in
subsequent
treble-damage
action.
i
couldn't
agree
with
it
more
on
that
point.
now,
we
really
submit
that
just
taking
this
aspect
of
the
different
view
points
that
have
been
advanced
on
the
finality
act
alone
by
the
courts,
and
now
with
respect
by
the
solicitor
general,
illustrates
just
what
happens
when
you
leave
the
clearly
chartered
rule
the
congress
laid
elsewhere.
there
has
been
unquestionably,
in
my
mind,
the
judgment,
an
invasion
of
the
congressional
sphere
here
and
the
guides
of
statutory
construction.
if
there
is
an
unarticulated
policy
of
antitrust
enforcement,
it
is
for
congress.
i
really
submit
rather
than
the
courts
to
declare.
this
is
not
a
question
of
an
ambiguous
statute
in
my
judgment
where
the
court
certainly
can
fill
in
and
ascertain
the
congressional
purpose
and
tell
us.
this
statute
is
crystal
clear
if
it's
fairly
read,
and
that
anything
done
in
the
courts
can
change
50
years
of
accepted
practice
necessarily
is
in
the
nature
of
essentially
the
same
act,
a
legislative
act.
we
submit
that
the
solicited
general's
appeal
is
for
outright
legislation
and
ask
this
court
to
declare
that
we
have
a
new
policy
of
enforcement.
i
think,
this
raises
a
serious
question
as
to
the
checks
and
balances
that
we
like
observe
in
our
constitutional
theory.
yet
he
argues
that
the
court
should
correct
essentially
what
it
persists
to
have
been
a
mistake
by
congress.
congress
was
mistaken
in
the
way
it
formulated
a
policy
which
had
never
articulated.
i
will
leave
those
questions
aside,
we
think
that
the
policy
offered
by
the
third
circuit
certainly
of
making
prima
facie
evidence
out
of
trade
commission
proceedings
does
raise
a
constitutional
question.
there
would
be
an
interpretation
of
a
statute
which
would
convert
into
evidence
--
into
prima
facie
evidence
that
would
establish
the
plaintiff's
case.
that
which
might
well
not
have
been
evidenced
in
the
trade
commission
proceeding
and
of
course
we
have
reference
there,
we
cite
judge
powell's
article
and
somehow
we
omit
it
from
our
main
brief
and
forgot
being
pick
up
on
a
replied
brief,
more
modern
article
by
mr.
barton
which
appears
in
the
current
columbia
law
review
on
the
same
problems
of
the
differences
in
administrative
and
judicial
proceeding
--
adjudicative
proceedings
by
administrative
agencies.
