is
only
262
feet
long.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
this
is
the
shortest
track
over
which
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
ever
asserted
section
118
jurisdiction.
the
track
comes
to
this
court
in
a
case
raising
an
issue
solely
of
the
commission's
jurisdiction
under
section
118.
as
such,
the
question
is
not
similar
to
what
it
might
be
if
the
appeal
to
the
lower
court
had
been
from
a
finding
of
the
commission
made
on
a
matter
clearly
within
the
scope
of
the
commission's
authority
to
act.
that
was
not
the
case
here.
we
contested
the
initial
basic
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
to
entertain
and
decide
this
case
under
section
118.
mr.
frank
m.
long
it
might
be
your
honor
and
let
me
elaborate
that.
in
my
opinion,
one
justification
where
the
commission's
118
jurisdiction
would
be
a
very
expensive
construction
of
trackage.
expensive
to
the
extent
that
it
would
imperil
the
financial
status
of
the
carrier
making
the
construction.
if
as
in
the
texas
case,
that
should
be
the
case,
then
i
believe
the
commission
rightly
could
take
jurisdiction
under
section
118.
however,
in
this
case
the
track
cost
only
$28,000
and
considering
the
size
and
the
financial
position
of
both
railroads
involved
that
expenditure
would
be
minimal.
mr.
frank
m.
long
in
my
opinion
your
honor,
no.
the
track
is
used
only
as
a
switching
track.
no
trains
move
over
the
connection.
no
trains
move
from
one
railroad
to
another
via
the
connection.
the
operation
is
simply
one
of
switching.
the
same
sort
of
switching
which
occurs
in
any
railroad
yard,
and
for
this
reason
mr.
chief
justice,
it
would
be
my
opinion
that
no
matter
how
long
the
track
was
so
long
as
the
operation
were
a
purely
a
switching
operation,
there
would
be
no
difference.
section
122
clearly
and
specifically
exempts
switching
tracks
from
the
requirements
of
section
118
and
therefore
of
course
from
the
commission's
section
118
jurisdiction.
mr.
frank
m.

yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
m.
long
i
don't
know,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
frank
m.
long
not
specifically.
no,
sir.
i
would
say
this
under
section
118,
the
commission
may
take
jurisdiction
whenever
a
railroad
by
means
of
new
construction
or
by
means
of
trackage
rights
over
another
railroad
undertakes
to
run
its
trains
as
opposed
to
a
switching
movement
over
that
trackage
or
trackage
rights
to
a
new
destination.
this
we
do
not
have
here,
neither
railroad
reaches
a
new
destination.
mr.
frank
m.
long
no
sir.
mr.
frank
m.
long
we
constructed
262
feet
of
track
your
honor,
and
in
my
opinion
this
is
not
a
construction
of
a
line
of
railroad,
it's
a
switching
track
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
m.
long
the
milwaukee
and
ishpeming
filed
an
application
under
section
5
requesting
authority
to
jointly
use
the
main
line
of
the
ishpeming
for
the
purpose
of
returning
the
milwaukee's
locomotive
to
its
own
line.
this
supplemental
application
was,
i
forgotten
whether
it
was
dismissed
or
withdrawn,
in
any
event
the
commission
said
that
in
view
of
the
118
application,
a
supplemental
application
was
unnecessary
and
need
not
be
considered.
that
is
not
an
issue
here.
mr.
frank
m.
long
no,
i
don't
your
honor,
because
i
--
mr.
frank
m.
long
i
don't
believe
it
is,
because
because
what
the
commission
did
rely
on
was
not
the
fact
that
we
had
extended
our
line
to
a
new
destination
which
of
course
was
not
the
case.
the
commission
relied
here
on
the
effect
upon
other
railroads.
the
ability
by
means
of
the
connection
to
institute
a
new
through
route
which
according
to
the
commission
would
have
detrimental
effects
upon
the
other
railroads
and
would
constitute
therefore
this
switching
track
and
extension
of
railroad
line,
however,
may
it
--
mr.
frank
m.
long
the
switching
track
is
not
an
extension
but
in
my
opinion,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
said
the
track
is
an
extension
because
of
these
other
effects.
these
--
mr.
frank
m.
long
it
is
sir.
yes,
an
extension
of
service.
we
conceive
of
this
facility
as
an
improvement
in
our
transportation
service
not
as
an
extension
of
line.
and
i
think
there's
a
big
difference
between
an
extension
of
railroad
line
and
the
improvement
of
transportation
service.
mr.
frank
m.
long
no
mr.
justice
black,
i
do
not

so.
because
section

mr.

mr.

is
our
case
precisely
because

mr.

and
very
properly
so,
your

mr.

such
cases.
mr.
frank
m.
long
in
the
cases
where
the
expertise
of
the
commission
should
be
respected,
the
issues
are
such
as
to
involve
factual
administrative
determinations.
the
determination
of
the
justness
of
a
rate
for
instance
or
as
under
section
118
--
mr.
frank
m.
long
no,
sir.
this
case
in
contrast
to
a
--
the
usual
sort
of
rate
case
presents
a
problem
of
the
construction
of
a
federal
statute,
section
118,
section
122
and
the
application
of
these
statutes
to
the
facts
of
this
litigation.
now,
the
facts
are
not
contested.
there
is
complete
agreement
and
there
always
has
been
as
to
exactly
what
the
facts
were
here.
the
issue
before
the
court
now
regardless
of
what
weight
ought
to
be
given
the
commission's
determination
is
a
legal
issue.
it
is
an
issue
--
mr.

yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
m.

congress
has
not
set
out
in
these
sections
of
the
act
any
definitive
standard.
it
has
left
to
the
courts.
mr.
frank
m.
long
to
the
courts.
yes,
sir.
may
i
suggest
that
this
court
said
in
two
cases,
the
texas
case
in
1926
and
in
the
idaho
case
that
this
sort
of
decision
is
not
one
which
should
be
made
primarily
by
the
commission?
it
is
a
legal
question
and
no
more
complicated
than
other
questions
the
courts
are
called
daily
to
decide.
the
circumstances
of
this
litigation,
therefore,
i
would
suggest
are
for
a
federal
court.
as
mr.
justice
brandeis
set
out
in
the
texas
case.
mr.
frank
m.
long
yes,
but
the
argument
was
made
in
that
case,
sir
that
the
court
should
respect
the
commission's
expertise
in
deciding
the
question
and
this
court
said
no.
this
is
a
question
primarily
for
the
court.
mr.
frank
m.
long
no,
sir.
because
the
commission
concluded
this
track
is
a
switching
track
as
the
applicant
suggests.
this
it
said
in
its
report
and
order
at
page
298
of
the
record,
i
believe.
mr.
frank
m.
long
296.
yes,
mr.
justice
black
and
then
the
commission
contradicted
itself
promptly
by
finding
that
the
track
was
an
extension.
now,
i
do
not
see
how
a
track
could
be
at
once
a
switching
track
and
at
the
same
time
an
extension
of
a
line
of
railroad.
mr.
frank
m.
long
mr.
justice
white,
i
--
mr.
frank
m.
long
i
believe
this
is
--
mr.
frank
m.
long
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
m.
long
yes,
sir.
however,
i
do
not
believe
that
those
factors
are
important
in
deciding
whether
or
not
the
track
is
an
extension
of
a
line
of
railroad
or
a
track
exempt
from
the
commission's
jurisdiction
under
section
122.
mr.
frank
m.
long
it's
clear
from
decisions
of
this
court
sir.
that
what
congress
intended
to
achieve
was
an
integrated
unified
streamline,
if
you
will,
railroad
transportation
system
which
would
not
--
the
tracks
of
which
would
not
duplicate
each
other
and
which
would
be
sound
financially.
now,
--
mr.
frank
m.
long
was
part
of
the
transportation
act
of
1920.
mr.
frank
m.
long
yes,
sir.
the
whole
idea
of
through
routes
and
the
competitive
effect
of
this
track,
in
my
opinion
are
irrelevant
to
the
question
whether
the
track
is
an
extension
of
a
line
of
railroad
or
is
exempt
by
virtue
of
being
a
switching
track.
mr.
frank
m.
long
the
conclusion
of
the
commission
was
that
if
the
track
was
a
switching
track.
mr.
frank
m.
long
the
second
paragraph
on
298
says,
"while
the
physical
movement
of
the
cars
in
a
line
of
one
carrier
to
the
other
is
as
contended
by
defendants
a
switching
movement."
the
act
of
placing
the
cars
and
removing
them
there
is
more
than
a
switching
movement.
mr.
frank
m.
long
yes.
mr.
frank
m.
long
yes,
in
the
next
paragraph.
mr.
frank
m.
long
the
track
is,
as
contended
by
defendants,
a
switching
--
excuse
me,
the
physical
movement
of
the
cars
is
a
switching
movement.
this
is
the
first
sentence
of
the
following
paragraph.
mr.
frank
m.
long
yes,
sir.
quite.
now,
the
--
mr.
frank
m.
long
pardon
me?
mr.
frank
m.
long
no,
sir.
mr.
frank
m.
long
these
are
carriers
which
are
already
loaded
on
one
railroad
at
another
point.
they
are
hold
by
that
railroad
to
the
side
of
this
connection
and
then
if
you
will
interchange
with
the
other
railroad
over
this
connection,
so
the
cars
are
already
loaded.
however,
it
is
a
switching
movement,
just
as
much
as
any
switching
movement
in
a
railroad
yard
is.
now,
the
commission
says
that
it
is
more
than
a
pure
switching
movement
because
it
is
a
part
of
an
actual
through
movement.
well,
so
it
is
but
so
is
also
a
switching
movement
in
a
yard
by
which
railroad
cars
are
classified
for
further
movement.
it
is
also
a
switching
movement
when
a
railroad
goes
at
--
makes
the
locomotive
to
go
into
an
industry
to
pick
up
cars
the
industry
has
loaded.
that
also
is
a
switching
movement
but
it
is
also
equally
as
necessary
to
the
through
movement
of
that
rail
traffic.
if
the
railroad
can't
pick
up
the
cars
of
the
place
where
they
were
loaded,
they
can't
make
any
line
haul
or
through
movement
with
those
cars.
but
these
are
--
mr.
frank
m.
long
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
are
two
points
on
the
question
you
just
raised.
the
first
is
this,
there
are
to
my
knowledge
only
two
ways
for
railroads
to
be
so
managed
to
become
one
system,
one
is
by
merger.
and
of
course
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
full
control
over
a
merger
and
their
approval
must
be
obtained
prior
to
the
merger.
secondly,
and
perhaps
more
important
in
this
case,
two
railroads
can
be
used
as
one
system
when
a
railroad
connects
with
another
and
moves
its
full
trains
in
a
line
haul
movement
as
opposed
to
a
switching
movement
over
the
connection
to
a
new
destination
on
the
line
of
the
other
railroad.
and
even
to
this,
interstate
commerce
commission
approval
under
section
118
must
be
obtained
not
however
because
the
trains
move
over
the
connecting
track
but
because
the
trains
move
over
the
track
of
the
other
railroad
pursuant
to
the
trackage
rights
and
to
a
new
destination.
the
same
as
if
the
railroad
had
built
its
own
tracks
to
the
new
destination.
mr.
frank
m.
long
oh!
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
m.
long
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
commission
held
this
track
to
be
an
extension,
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
frank
m.
long
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
frank
m.
long
there
is
one
other
interesting
answer
to
your
question,
however,
which
might
have
some
bearing
upon
this.
and
that
is
the
question
of
through
routes.
the
commission
based
its
determination
primarily,
i
think
on
the
fact
that
new
through
routes
were
made
possible
by
the
connection.
but
through
routes
are
completely
irrelevant
to
any
question
concerning
a
trackage.
this
connection
could
exist
without
the
through
routes.
as
a
matter
of
fact
any
extension
could
exist
without
through
routes
and
still
be
an
extension.
the
milwaukee
road
could
build
a
new
line
of
track
from
chicago
to
washington.
it
would
cost
a
tremendous
amount
of
money
and
if
we
never
shipped
a
single
cargo
or
traffic
over
that
track,
we
would
still
have
an
extension
if
for
no
other
reason
on
the
cost.
similarly,
the
through
route
might
also
exist
in
the
absence
of
the
connection.
it
would
be
quite
unfeasible
but
still
possible
for
the
railroads
to
put
a
crane
between
the
two
tracks
and
physically
lift
up
the
cars
from
one
railroad
put
them
on
the
tracks
of
the
other
railroad.
we
have
a
through
route
then.
the
railroads
could
hold
themselves
out
to
perform
the
continuous
transportation
service
by
that
means
and
--
mr.
frank
m.
long
i
doubt
that
it
would
be
needed
sir.
not
certainly
under
section
118
because
we
have
not
extended
our
line
of
railroad.
because
we
have
not
built
with
steel,
wood
ties
and
ballast
any
new
trackage.
but
i
think
that
in
that
instance
we
would
have
a
through
route.
mr.
frank
m.
long
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
this
mr.
justice
black,
no
other
railroad
uses
the
mainline
tracks
of
the
other
railroad,
except
incidentally
in
performing
the
switching
movement.
mr.
frank
m.
long
the
controversy
is
not
between
either
the
railroads
which
constructed
the
connection.
the
connection
was
made
completely
voluntarily.
the
controversy
is
--
was
initially
in
the
lower
court
between
the
commission
and
the
united
states
joined
in
by
the
--
mr.
frank
m.
long
the
northwestern
and
the
sew
line.
mr.
frank
m.
long
the
northwestern
railroad
in
chicago
northwestern
and
the
sew
line.
mr.
frank
m.
long
we
have
already
been
before
the
commission
and
they
have
decided
the
issue
of
public
convenience
and
necessity,
admittedly,
one
within
their
scope
to
decide.
and
that
their
decision
was
that
we
should
close
the
connection
and
cease
to
operate
it.
mr.
frank
m.
long
mr.
justice
black,
without
this
connection
the
shippers
of
sawlogs
would
probably
cease
to
use
rail
transportation
for
the
shipment
of
their
sawlogs.
and
i
refer
the
court
to
references
in
the
testimony
taken
before
the
hearing
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
it
appears
at
pages
128
and
129
of
the
record
at
156

157
of
the
record.
mr.
frank
m.

only
the
motor
tracks.
mr.
frank
m.
long
i
don't
believe
that
it
is,
except
incidentally.
mr.
frank
m.

i
suggest,
however,
the
intent
was
to
imply
rail
carrier
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact
sir,
neither

mr.

in
my
opinion
none,
but
to
northwestern
and
sew
line
suggested
they
have
been.
mr.
frank
m.
long
yes,
because
i
believe
the
traffic
would
go
by
motor
track
if
it
could
not
go
via
republic
junction.
mr.
frank
m.
long
the
fact
the
traffic
can
move
over
republic
junction
your
honor.
it
means
that
the
traffic
will
not
move
via
the
sew
line
or
via
the
northwestern
to
their
connections
with
the
milwaukee.
and
in
effect,
what
the
connection
does
is
eliminate
the
sew
line
on
the
one
hand
and
also
the
northwestern
from
participation
in
the
track.
mr.
frank
m.
long
this
is
--
mr.
frank
m.
long
yes,
i
believe
so
and
i
think
they
mean
the
northwestern
the
sew
line.
actually
--
mr.
frank
m.
long
i
suppose
there
might
be
a
scintilla
of
evidence.
but
mr.
justice
black,
this
question
is
proper
for
the
commission's
consideration
on
the
issue
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
and
this,
the
lower
court,
did
not
reach
in
its
decision.
the
lower
court
decided
only
the
jurisdictional
issue.
may
i
suggest
that
republic
junction
is
an
improvement
of
the
facilities
provided
by
these
railroads
to
the
shipping
public
and
as
such
the
connection
fulfills
the
railroads'
duties
to
serve
the
public?
in
14
stat.
66,
the
railroads
are
authorized
to
make
connections
with
other
railroads
with
the
through
movement
of
traffic
and
section
14
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
likewise
imposes
a
duty
upon
railroads
to
create
through
routes
and
to
make
new
facilities
for
the
efficient
operation
of
the
through
routes.
mr.
frank
m.
long
no,
sir.
the
commission
need
not
approve
the
creation
of
any
through
route,
nor
can
--
nor
can
the
commission
prohibit
the
voluntary
creation
of
a
through
route.
mr.
frank
m.
long
that
is
the
effect,
but
by
the
commission's
decision,
it
attempts
to
prohibit
the
new
through
route
which
is
made
possible
by
the
connection.
mr.
frank
m.
long
yes,
sir.
and
i
believe
it
is
completely
unlawful
thing
for
the
commission
to
do
because
i
don't
believe
congress
has
ever
given
them
authority
to
prohibit
the
creation
of
a
voluntary
through
route.
if
they
had,
in
my
opinion,
congress
would
have
given
the
commission
that
power
within
the
limits
of
section
15
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
deals
with
through
routes,
but
not
under
section
118
which
deals
with
physical
trackage
in
the
construction
of
extensions
of
railroad
line.
mr.
frank
m.
long
i
believe
so,
sir.
i
believe
so.
mr.
frank
m.
long
or
at
least
which
congress
has
never
granted
them.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
m.
long
new
through
routes,
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
m.
long
yes,
now
perhaps
what
your
honor
has
reference
to
is
some
case
arising
under
section
15
(3)
or
section
15
(4)
by
which
one
railroad
may
go
to
the
commission
seeking
the
commission's
order
compelling
another
railroad
to
join
with
in
a
through
route.
but
--
mr.
frank
m.
long
--
they
can
compel
it
sir
but
not
forbid
it
and
they
certainly
cannot
forbid
the
voluntary
creation
of
the
through
route.
it
seems
to
me
that
one
of
the
implicit
factors
about
rail
transportation
in
the
united
states
is
the
ability
of
a
shipper
to
ship
any
traffic
from
any
point
in
the
united
states
to
any
other
point
by
rail.
this
is
i
think
it
once
a
strength
of
our
railroad
system
and
it
is
this
ability
which
republic
junction
makes
possible
in
the
upper
peninsula
of
michigan
so
far
as
the
traffic
moving
there
over
is
concerned.
mr.
frank
m.
long
yes,
sir.
it
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
frank
m.
long
yes.
because
--
but
the
consequence
of
that
decision
would
be
to
make
necessary
a
section
118
application
to
the
commission
--
mr.
frank
m.
long
--
a
railroad
undertook
to
build
a
new
switching
track
in
their
yard.
and
i
don't
believe
the
commission
would
appreciate
being
so
burdened
nor
would
the
courts
appreciate
the
multiplicity
of
litigation
arising.
mr.
frank
m.
long
it
would
be
if
it
had
the
same
function
and
were
only
a
switching
movement
and
cost
no
more
money
--
mr.
frank
m.
long
yes.
mr.
frank
m.
long
however,
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
such
a
situation
which
would
not
involve
the
extension
of
the
railroad
to
a
new
terminus
and
therefore
ipso
facto
the
fact
would
be
an
extension.
mr.
frank
m.
long
but
republic
junction
is
completely
constructed
within
the
confines
of
the
rights
of
way
of
the
milwaukee
and
the
ishpeming.
if
we
likewise
construct
a
track
100
hundred
miles
long
without
going
outside
the
rights
of
way
of
the
railroad,
then
i
would
say
it
would
be
exactly
the
same.
but
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
that
of
course.
mr.
frank
m.
long
perhaps,
but
not
necessarily.
it
would
be
--
the
longer
the
track
is,
the
more
likely
it
is
that
we
would
have
something
else
besides
just
a
switching
track.
there
are
certain
other
statutes
such
as
the
airbrake
statute
which
requires
trains
to
move
over,
and
by
train
i
mean
a
locomotive
in
a
caboose
with
the
air
hose
is
connected
so
that
the
train
has
brakes.
it
requires
certain
movements
to
be
made
with
cranes
as
opposed
to
switching
movements.
and
i
would
think
that
if
the
track
that
you
described,
a
hundred
miles
long,
were
possible
that
these
other
statutes
would
require
trains
to
move
over
that
and
that
itself
would
make
quite
a
difference,
i
believe.
thank
you.
