justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
acknowledge
any
--
i
don't
know
what
you
call
it,
expertise
or
something
like
that.
especially
in
the
icc
which
we
should
respect,
the
court
should
respect
in
the
decision
whether
or
not
a
given
operation
like
this
from
the
one
hand
an
extension
and
on
the
other
hand
a
switching
line?
ordinarily,
don't
we
in
many
of
these
railroad
things
about
which
judges
don't
know
much
from
the
icc
may
know
no
more
but
supposed
to
know
like
this.
don't
we
ordinarily
give
respect
to
their
determination
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
isn't
that
--
?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
isn't
that
this
kind
of
a
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
i
remember
forgotten
the
trial
of
the
case
but
we
have
one
here
a
couple
of
years
ago
whether
or
not
--
in
one
trucking
area,
whether
or
not
a
given
operation
by
furniture
manufacturer
was
a
contract
carriage
or
private
carriage.
and
we
thought
in
that
case
that
the
standards
for
that
determination
were
more
appropriately
to
be
fashioned
by
the
icc
and
they
did
fashion
them.
although,
they
changed
their
minds
over
the
years
as
to
what
were
the
appropriate
standards
that
we
ought
to
give
respect
to
that
determination
and
my
recollection
as
we
sustained
it
here,
i'm
just
wondering
if
this
case
presents
that
kind
of
a
problem.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
yes,
the
legal
issue
is
whether
it's
an
extension
or
a
switching
line,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
how
--
what
are
the
standards
which
judges
can
apply
to
decide
whether
it's
one
or
the
other
on
these
facts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
was
a
seven
mile
long
extension
or
something,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
you
--
but
there
was
a
finding
that
you
did?
i'm
looking
at
298.
it
seems
to
me
in
this
paragraph
of
298,
the
icc
has
given
a
gloss
to
extension
in
the
statute
as
embracing
the
pick
up
by
reason
of
this
connection
by
these
two
lines
of
traffic
which
if
carried
by
rail
would've
been
carried
by
other
carriers.
the
last
sentence
of
that
next
to
the
last
paragraph
is
thus
the
creation
of
the
connection
enables
both
defendants
to
compete
for
traffic
in
territories
not
previously
served
by
them
and
which
were
there
before
adequately
served
by
other
carriers.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
carrier?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
long
what
--
what
carriers
is
the
commission
talking
about
in
the
previous
sentence?
all
traffic
destined
to
points
on
either
the
defendant
lines
but
for
this
connection,
i
interpolate,
would
have
moved
over
routes
in
which
other
carriers
would
have
participated.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
rail
carriers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
another
way
of
saying
mr.
long
that
if
they
rested
this
on
the
effect
of
the
connection
on
the
traffic
of
competing
roads.
if
they
did,
that
as
a
matter
of
law
that's
an
improper
consideration
and
determination
under
118
whether
that
something
is
an
extension?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
in
those
case
mr.
danielson,
goes
so
far
as
i
read
this
excerpt
at
page
298
that
the
commission
were
to
say
that
the
creation
of
the
connection
enable
the
defendants
to
compete
for
traffic
which
therefore
was
adequately
served
by
other
carriers,
does
it
go
that
far?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
purpose
is
of
one
is
an
extension
with
in
line
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see!
these
cases
are
public
convenience
in
necessity
not
118
cases
that
you
have
cited.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
