mr.
john
c.
danielson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
arises
from
a
connection
of
two
railroads
in
michigan's
upper
peninsula,
the
milwaukee
road,
one
of
the
appellees
and
the
lake
superior
and
ishpeming
one
of
the
other
appellees.
these
are
both
class
1
railroads
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
significant
fact
of
the
lesser
luminary,
the
lake
superior
and
ishpeming
which
we
shall
as
the
l.s.&
i.
is
that
it
is
controlled
significantly
by
the
cleveland-cliffs
iron
company
as
the
record
shows.
now,
this
connection
is
the
first
time
in
history
as
the
record
likewise
shows
that
these
two
railroads
have
ever
been
physically
connected.
now,
there
appears
in
the
record
a
large
print
which
was
prepared
by
the
appellant,
milwaukee,
showing
this
situation
where
the
mainline
and
it
is
important
i
suggest
in
view
of
certain
decisions
of
this
court
that
this
is
the
mainline
of
the
ishpeming,
l.s.
&
i.,
coming
down
here
and
ultimately
terminating
at
iron
mine
at
a
place
called
republic,
michigan.
likewise,
here
comes
the
mainline
of
the
milwaukee
up
and
ultimately
terminating
at
a
point
called
champion,
michigan.
the
connection
is
constructed
here
between
these
two
points
shown
as
a
to
b,
rather
small,
262
feet
in
all
to
accomplish
the
connection.
but
the
court
should
see
that
it
is
physically
impossible
for
trains
ever
to
operate
this
connection
and
to
deliver
cars
upon
these
interchanged
tracks.
the
red
shows
milwaukee
ownership,
the
blue
shows
the
l.s.&
i.
ownership.
it
is
physically
impossible
in
the
first
instance
for
the
milwaukee
ever
to
achieve
the
delivery
which
we
call
interchange,
the
placement
of
a
car
routed
with
traffic
in
a
position
where
another
railroad
may
pick
it
up.
impossible
physically
to
operate
under
these
interchanged
tracks
by
the
milwaukee
without
operating
between
c
and
d,
the
main
line
of
the
ishpeming.
the
court
should
see
also,
and
it
is
important
because
the
court
below
did
not
see
this.
mr.
john
c.
danielson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
northwestern
intervened
in
the
complaint
brought
by
the
railroad
which
is
not
here,
the
sew
line,
in
the
proceeding
before
the
commission.
the
commission
proceeding
culminated
in
a
three-judge
review
in
a
federal
court
in
wisconsin
and
is
hereby
direct
appeal.
now,
not
only
is
it
necessary
for
milwaukee
to
operate
on
the
l.s.&
i.
mainline
in
order
to
arrive
on
these
interchanged
tracks,
but
having
arrived
on
its
track
one,
where
it
delivers
its
locomotive
on
the
head
end
of
these
cars
must
come
up
on
to
the
l.s.&
i.
in
order
to
return
back
to
the
milwaukee
road
either
through
track
two
if
there
are
no
l.s.&
i.
cars
waiting
to
be
taken
on
to
the
milwaukee
or
over
the
l.s.&
i.
mainline
for
a
very
significant,
what
we
have
here,
roughly
3000
feet.
now,
originally
this
was
set
up
as
a
lease
of
the
mainline
of
the
l.s.&
i.
to
the
milwaukee.
once
the
commission
received
the
complaint
of
the
other
intervenor,
sew
line,
the
lease
was
changed
into
a
form
of
agreement
which
is
set
out.
the
lease
originally
appears
in
the
record
beginning
at
page
49,
describes
the
lease
of
l.s.&
i.'s
main
track
on
that
page
and
on
page
51.
at
the
hearing
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
the
agreement
was
transformed
into
a
license.
we
contend
this
makes
no
difference,
tracked
rights
being
involved
may
be
a
personal
right.
they
involve
no
necessary
estate
in
the
land.
this
court
has
so
held
in
thompson
against
the
texas-mexican
railroad
company
in
the
328
volume
of
the
united
states
reports.
well,
the
form
then
should
make
no
difference
but
the
court
below
was
confused
into
thinking
that,
and
it
left
out
one
element
of
the
preceding
we
feel
that
and
the
court
below
held
at
page
390
of
the
record
that
there
was
no
operation
by
either
of
these
appellees
across
the
line
of
the
other's
railroad.
the
fact
here
is
that
it
is
physically
impossible
to
accomplish
this
interchange
of
traffic
without
that
type
of
operation.
now,
once
there
was
a
connection
through
routes
were
established
by
rate
action
taken
by
the
milwaukee
and
the
l.s.&
i.
a
connection
of
course
is
a
sine
qua
non
of
through
routes.
without
the
connection,
there
can
be
no
through
routes.
now,
prior
to
this
time,
there
existed
between
the
point
designated
sunrise
landing
on
lake
superior
and
ishpeming,
this
is
contracted
from
an
exhibit
in
the
record.
it's
very
dramatically
oversimplified.
there
existed
between
a
major
shipping
point,
sunrise
landing
owned
by
cleveland-cliffs
shipping,
cleveland-cliffs
forest
products,
a
two-line
through
route
between
northwestern
and
l.s.&
i.
where
l.s.&
i.
could
bring
the
traffic
either
to
ishpeming
or
a
lower
point
designated,
little
lake,
transport
to
northwestern
and
bring
it
to
iron
mountain,
michigan
where
there
was
located
a
substantial
consuming
industry
and
to
which
the
predominant
portion
of
this
traffic
moved
as
the
commission
found.
the
fact
of
the
two-line
interchange
was
important
because
the
record
shows
and
the
commission
found
that
unless
the
receiver
at
iron
mountain
could
have
two-line
rates
in
his
inbound
forest
products,
sawlogs,
chemical
woods,
the
grades
of
the
classification
in
terms
of
absolutely
low
rated
commodities.
he
would
instead
--
mr.
john
c.
danielson
sir?
mr.
john
c.
danielson
the
uniform
freight
classification,
mr.
justice
stewart.
it's
the
--
mr.
john
c.
danielson
as
far
as
classification,
we
do
not
have
a
term
any
longer
that
says
first
class,
fifth
class.
in
fact
now,
these
are
commodity
rates
--
mr.
john
c.
danielson
--
and
they
take
20%,
we'll
say,
or
14%
of
the
first
class
rating.
mr.
john
c.
danielson
quite
low
rated
as
the
commission
did
find
sir.
now,
the
milwaukee
could
participate
in
such
a
movement,
but
it
could
not
make
a
two-line
move
with
l.s.&
i.
there
was
no
physical
connection
at
this
point
which
was
to
become
republic
junction.
then,
it
puts
do
it
with
the
sew
line
as
a
three-line
route
more
expensive
and
would
not
be
competitive.
the
record
is
quite
clear
on
this.
after
october
21,
when
the
connection
was
constructed,
the
route
existed
and
the
records
show
more
than
half
of
the
traffic
began
flowing
this
way.
this
the
commission
found
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
the
industry
in
this
area
in
its
opinion
was
not
adequate
to
sustain
the
existing
operations
after
diluting
this
traffic,
this
light
density
low
rated
traffic,
among
so
many
more
carriers.
now,
the
issue
as
it
arose
three-judge
court
was
jurisdiction,
this
is
a
word
of
many
facets
and
it
has
always
caused
complications
and
the
essential
facts
or
the
essential
theories
were
these.
the
milwaukee
and
the
l.s.&
i.
had
always
relied
upon
an
old
missouri
pacific
case.
and
we,
in
our
turn,
had
relied
upon
the
alabama
and
vicksburg
decision
of
this
court
in
the
271
united
states.
now,
the
--
do
not
mistake
our
thinking.
we
suggest
that
in
alabama
and
vicksburg
there
was
more
than
the
single
element
of
a
connection
between
the
main
lines
of
two
major
railroads.
we
feel,
however,
that
isn't
an
alternative
disposition
in
that
case,
certainly
no
less.this
court
held
that
the
commission
must
have
jurisdiction
over
connections
between
mainlines
of
class
1
railroad,
because
of
the
competitive
consequences
which
emanate
from
it,
because
of
the
possibility
of
thereby
opening
up
new
through
routes.
now,
the
commission
did
find
that
by
virtue
of
this
connection
the
competitive
picture
changed
quite
drastically
in
the
territory.
now,
the
court
below
made
three
serious
mistakes
we
feel.
first,
it
went
outside
the
record
in
order
to
sustain
several
of
the
findings
which
are
contained
in
its
report.
i
would
point
to
the
court
at
page
391
of
the
record.
the
court
below
says
that
this
is
an
unpopulated
wilderness.
now,
there
was
ample
opportunity
in
a
hearing
before
a
commission
examiner
in
a
returned
questionnaire
in
the
various
applications
filed
by
these
applicants
below
to
assert
this.it
does
not
appear
in
this
record
anywhere.
mr.
john
c.
danielson
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
would
submit
this
that
the
only
support
for
that
finding
could
be
two
photographs
that
were
attached
to
the
complaint
to
the
district
court
for
the
first
time.
those
photographs
were
deliberately
not
produced
by
me,
the
defendants,
the
government,
and
the
railroads
before
the
district
court
took
the
position
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
mississippi
river
barge
line
case
which
we
could
cite
to
you
in
the
record,
it's
at
page
312.
we
took
the
position
in
our
answer
that
these
were
extraneous
matters
and
not
properly
before
the
court.
i'm
afraid
i
have
given
the
court
an
erroneous
citation.
mr.
john
c.
danielson
it
is
in
the
answer
of
the
government
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
let
me
get
this
accurately
for
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
danielson
surely
not.
mr.
john
c.
danielson
we
do
submit
your
honor
that
the
only
place
it
could've
come
to
the
court,
as
shown
on
page
3
of
this
record,
however,
is
from
the
extraneous
phonographs
which
we
did
suggest
were
not
properly
before
that
court.
mr.
john
c.
danielson
surely.
there
exist
more
and
more
serious
error
and
i
would
like
to
proceed
to
it
if
i
may.
now
--
mr.
john
c.
danielson
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
danielson
in
my
personal
observation
your
honor
--
mr.
john
c.
danielson
--
there
exists
one
significant
iron
ore
mine,
and
in
the
immediate
vicinage,
i
see
no
industrial
community.
i
have
been
there
myself
and
i
understand
that
apart
from
the
one
significant
iron
ore
operation,
there
is
no
significant
commercial
activity.
mr.
john
c.
danielson
yes,
sir.
now,
second,
this
court
sitting
as
a
reviewing
court
put
itself
in
the
position
of
a
court
deciding
in
the
first
instance
whether
being
approached
by
a
railroad
with
the
assertion
that
its
competitor
was
building
an
unauthorized
connection.
it,
the
one-judge
court
should
compel
that
competing
railroad
to
go
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
establish
that
the
interconnection
was
compatible
with
the
public
interest.
now,
there
have
been
established
a
long
line
of
cases
and
several
tests
pretty
well
settling
what
are
the
elements
of
inquiry
of
a
one-judge
court
in
such
a
matter.
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
is
far
from
the
function
of
a
reviewing
court
after
the
commission
has
passed
upon
the
juris
--
pardon
me,
upon
the
jurisdictional
question,
and
after
it
has
passed
on
it
here
as
it
did
so
carefully
in
its
report,
and
after
as
it
observes
and
its
examiner
observes
this
disposition
is
consistent
with
the
commission's
uniformed
practice
in
these
matters.
and
we
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
more
recent
decisions
of
this
court
which
we
explain
at
considerable
length
in
the
briefs
here
are
positively
repugnant
in
our
opinion
with
that
construction.
now,
this
court
dealt
with
two
decisions
here,
powell
against
the
united
states
and
the
united
states
versus
idaho.
both
three-judge
courts,
both
affirmed
here
on
holdings
that
where
the
jurisdictional
question
arose
before
the
commission
ought
to
differ
entirely
because
this
was
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact
susceptible
of
resolution
only
in
a
federal
court
not
before
the
commission.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
commission
has
evolved
the
practice
which
lays
mr.
justice
brandeis
foundation
there
at
rest.
and
that
the
commission
is
now
able
as
it
was
here
and
in
many
other
cases
which
we
have
decided
to
bring
recalcitrant
carriers
before
it,
and
to
apply
a
transportation
standard
to
these
statutory
specifics
in
determining
whether
the
public
interest
permits
an
interconnection.
now,
this
powell
and
idaho
series
of
cases
we
submit
hs
been
seriously
eroded
by
the
district
courts
applying
these
standards
ultimately
by
the
second
circuit
which
we
have
cited
to
the
court
already.
we
have
the
state
of
illinois
case.
we
have
the
state
of
georgia
case.
we
have
the
yonkers
decisions
which
the
federal
courts
now
have
come
to
recognize
as
giving
the
commission
first
instance
power
and
presumptive
weight
on
review
in
determining
this
essential
element
of
jurisdiction.
for
as
this
court
found
in
yonkers,
as
this
court
rules
squarely
in
yonkers,
without
the
jurisdictional
decision
by
the
interstate
commission
a
federal
court
ought
had
nothing
to
do
with
review
of
its
order.
these
are
basic
questions
of
federalism.
we
have
the
states
and
the
interstate
commission
constantly
in
a
turmoil
as
to
whose
power
shall
dispose
of
the
public
interest
question.
and
this
court,
we
feel,
made
this
quite
clear
in
the
yonkers
case
that
without
that
decision
by
the
commission,
there
could
be
nothing
further
in
an
abandonment
or
an
extension
proceeding.
the
commission
made
those
findings.
they
are
eminently
well
reasonably
submitted,
and
they
ought
to
have
been
treated
with
not
finality
by
with
the
presumptive
weight
which
ordinarily
attaches
to
the
routine
disposition
by
the
administrative
agency
of
these
essential
elements.
now,
the
court
had
this
question
before
it
in
the
state
of
georgia
case
where
the
jurisdictional
statement
argued
at
page
26
in
number
774
of
the
october
term
of
1957,
and
i
quote,
"the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
must
be
decided
by
the
court
unhampered
by
findings
of
the
commission,
the
scope
of
judicial
inquiry
into
this
matter
being
unrestricted."
now,
we
don't
suggest
that
some
reaffirmance
here
disposed
of
that
as
a
complete
disposition
by
this
court.
we
do
suggest,
however,
that
the
regular
erosion
which
preceded
the
state
of
georgia
case
was
receiving
at
least
acquiescence
from
this
court
by
the
summary
affirmance
which
resulted
in
that
matter.
now,
the
court
below
took
one
unique
aberrational
decision,
it
took
the
missouri-pacific
matter
and
relying
upon
that
said,
"this
is
too
small
a
matter
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
concern
itself
with."
if
the
court
were
to
look
at
the
missouri-pacific
decision
it
would
find,
this
is
in
60
f.2d
commencing
at
page
126.
it
would
find
that
the
carriers
there
seeking
to
interchange
at
that
time
had
and
historically
had
had
an
interchange
which
permitted
them
to
connect
and
to
establish
and
there
were
established
a
line
of
through
routes
over
them.
a
second
carrier
came
in
not
party
to
this
proceeding
and
said,
"we
want
you
to"
--
it
acquired
the
little
bridge
line
over
which
these
two
carriers
had
interchanged
in
the
past.
it
said,
"now
you'll
do
it
with
us
a
different
way."
and
they
said,
"well
we'll
simply
build
across
and
forget
with
any
need
for
your
service."
and
in
fact
that
was
done
and
the
court
there
said.
there's
no
significant
competitive
or
other
change.
we
find
no
need
for
it
to
go
to
the
interstate
commission.
that
is
a
far
cry
we
submit
from
the
type
of
decision
here.
but
now
--
mr.
john
c.
danielson
that
is
correct,
it
really
did.
mr.
john
c.
danielson
very
clearly.
it's
a
logical
deficiency
in
the
analogy,
we
submit.
it
was
not
recognized
there
because
there
had
never
been
such
interchange
in
the
past
between
these
applicants.
mr.
john
c.
danielson
quite
significant
sir.
mr.
john
c.
danielson
yes
sir.
now,
the
final
problem
that
occurs
here
and
we
submit
ought
to
concern
this
court
is
this,
that
this
court
below
equated
an
invasion
of
territory
under
the
texas
and
pacific
case
with
an
extension
of
line
as
designated
by
the
statute.
it
said
that
without
an
invasion,
there
could
be
no
extension
and
therefore
no
118
disposing
of
physical
invasion
because
we
would
not
contend
that
his
262
feet
is
a
physical
invasion.
it
said
that
there
can
be
other
type
of
extension
under
section
118,
not
so
says
the
interstate
commission,
because
in
a
case
which
we
have
cited,
the
case
which
ultimately
came
to
this
court
and
was
affirmed
under
the
state
of
georgia
decision.
the
commission
said,
"we
have
three
tests
of
extension."
this
appears
at
page
20
of
our
original
brief.
it
said,
"this
include
among
other
things
matters
pertaining
to
the
purpose
of
the
track"
and
then
"whether
new
routes
in
interstate
commerce
would
be
established
through
the
use
of
such
track"
and
then
as
a
third
element
"whether
the
construction
and
operation
would
constitute
an
invasion."
so
to
the
interstate
commission,
there
are
three
tests.
it
has
applied
these
tests
for
quite
a
long
while.
and
the
court
says,
"there
can
be
but
one,
as
we
announce
the
statute
to
you
the
commission,
you
have
found
an
incorrect
test
of
extension
therefore
you
may
not
be
sustained."
this,
we
submit,
unduly
restricts
the
commission
and
its
routine
administration
of
the
statute
with
which
it
is
charged.
finally,
the
milwaukee
concedes
and
the
ishpeming
at
page
38
of
their
brief
that
there
would
be
118
jurisdiction
over
this
extension
if
there
were
trackage
rights
and
it
argues
with
simply
an
ipse
dixit
for
authority
that
because
they
reach
no
new
terminal
there
are
none.
we
submit
that
the
alabama
and
vicksburg
decision,
the
thompson
versus
texas-mexican
decision
and
the
many
decisions
cited
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
added
to
by
milwaukee's
own
preceding
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
under
section
118
to
abandon
and
interchange
nder
almost
identical
circumstances
indicate
very
clearly
that
there
does
exist
this
element
of
section
118
jurisdiction.
the
district
court
did
not
deal
with
this
issue.
now,
we
would
therefore
contend
that
the
decision
of
the
commission
clearly
had
a
complete
support
in
its
evidential
record.
it
was
amply
rationalized
and
that
it
had
a
very
ample
foundation
in
repeated
decisions
not
only
of
this
court,
but
its
own
uniform
practice.
and
upon
that
basis,
there
was
no
need
nor
to
the
decision
of
this
court
permit,
re-decision
of
the
issue
anew
by
the
reviewing
court.
if
there
is
time
remaining,
i
should
like
to
use
it
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
c.
danielson
i'd
like
to
answer
several
specific
questions,
if
i
may.
the
question
most
recently
raised
by
mr.
justice
black
is
one
which
troubles
me.
the
question
is
concerning
the
power
of
the
commission
to
permit
the
establishment
of
the
new
through
route.
now,
i
think
that
you
should
be
quite
clear
mr.
justice
black
that
the
railroad
having
a
connection
is
empowered
to
establish
unilaterally
new
through
routes
over
any
existing
connection,
no
question.
the
commission
indeed
may
compel
a
railroad
to
establish
new
through
routes
which
do
not
exist
over
an
existing
connection
but
which
the
railroad
itself
does
not
see
fit
to
establish.
but
what
we
have
here
is
the
but
for,
but
for
this
200
feet
of
track
there
would
exist
no
possibility
for
the
railroad
voluntarily
or
compulsorily
to
establish
through
routes.
this
"but
for"
is
what
the
commission
has
power
to
control
because
this
"but
for"
has
immense
competitive
and
transportation
significance
we
submit.
mr.
john
c.
danielson
if
they
had
made
such
a
finding
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
c.
danielson
if
they
had
--
mr.
john
c.
danielson
alright,
let
me
make
this
point.
the
decisions
of
this
court
say,
and
we've
set
out
a
number
of
them
at
pages
14
through
15
of
our
original
brief
here.
these
decisions,
and
i'm
citing
from
the
oregon-washington
case
back
in
the
288
u.s.,
say
that
an
extension
though
something
other
than
a
team
switching
industrial
or
sidetrack
need
not,
in
order
to
be
distinguished
there
from,
and
i
interpolate
in
order
therefore
to
be
outside
of
the
section
122
exemption.
they
are
building
into
a
new
and
previously
un-served
locality.
you
don't
need
a
new
destination
this
court
has
held,
and
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
john
c.
danielson
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
john
c.
danielson
you
raise
this
question
--
mr.
john
c.
danielson
--
you
raised
this
question
earlier
mr.
justice
black.
the
certificate
under
what
ground
does
the
commission
take
jurisdiction
here,
under
what
book
of
section
118.
the
application
set
out
at
page
24
of
the
record
says,
that
these
applicants
want
a
certificate
to
operate
over
an
interchanged
connection.
this
court
holds
in
the
alabama
and
vicksburg
case
and
in
the
texas-mexican
case
that
this
type
of
a
connection
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
under
section
118,
the
existence
of
the
connection;
the
potential
for
establishing
through
routes.
these
factors
bring
within
the
commission's
jurisdiction
under
section
118
such
a
connection.
now
--
mr.
john
c.
danielson
alabama
and
vicksburg,
it
is
decided
at
--
we've
set
out
in
two
of
the
briefs.
i
don't
have
it
specifically
before
me
mr.
justice
black.
as
to
the
--
mr.
john
c.
danielson
specifically
and
the
tex-mex
case
likewise
specifically
settles
that
point.
there
is
a
clear
holding
where
it
was
necessary
to
reach
section
118
under
the
trackage
rights
issue
in
order
to
take
from
the
bankruptcy
court
and
refer
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
the
issue
of
trackage
rights
and
their
establishment
in
that
case
abandonment.
we
contend
that
establishment
--
mr.
john
c.
danielson
these
are
independent
determinations
of
public
convenience
not
of
jurisdiction
your
honor,
but
we
would
take
the
position
mr.
justice
brennan
that
its
findings
on
public
convenience
ought
to
be
findings
treated
for
the
jurisdictional
element
as
well.
mr.
john
c.
danielson
absolutely,
no
question.
may
i
comment
further
--
mr.
john
c.
danielson
section
118
having
jurisdiction
then
requires
the
commission
to
determine
whether
public
convenience
and
necessity
--
mr.
john
c.
danielson
--
permit.
mr.
justice
white
raised
the
question
of
the
purpose
of
section
118,
at
page
15
of
our
brief.
we
set
forward
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
texas
and
new
orleans
case
and
let
me
emphasize
this
briefly.
the
purpose
of
sections
--
of
paragraphs
18
to
22
is
to
prevent
interstate
carriers
from
weakening
themselves
by
constructing
or
operating
superfluous
lines
and
to
protect
them
from
being
weakened
by
another
carriers
operating
in
interstate
commerce
a
competing
line
not
required
in
the
public
interest.
this
is
a
clear
holding
by
this
court
on
that
precise
issue
and
i
did
not
want
it
to
escape
--
mr.
john
c.
danielson
i
am
that
complainant
sir.
my
client
is.
mr.
john
c.
danielson
and
at
our
expense
because
the
record
shows
--
mr.
john
c.
danielson
or
by
another
carrier
establishing
a
line
competing
which
is
superfluous
as
the
commission
found
this
connection
to
be,
because
prior
to
this
establishment
of
this
connection
each
and
every
law,
each
and
every
pound
of
sawdust
if
you
will,
every
bit
of
traffic
that
moved
was
moving
over
the
light
density
line
which
we
had
heretofore
operated
for
almost
100
years
in
that
territory.
mr.
john
c.
danielson
which
railroad
are
we
speaking
of
sir?
mr.
john

it
is

the
commission
found
the
predominant
portion
of
traffic
moving
over

connection
was
entirely
handled
by
us

to
that
that
it
would

we

in

of

uncontested
facts
are

out

you.
