chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
would
you
answer
his
question
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
that
character
of
terrain
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
substantially,
what
the
court
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
long
perhaps
in
respect
with
our
record
but
when
we
assume
the
commission
found
this
extension
not
the
commission
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
a
matter
of
fact
if
this
means
more
than
a
switching
track,
indeed
saying
it
is
an
extension
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
said
just
above
that
considering
in
the
light
of
the
facts
involved,
be
an
outmost
procedure,
it
is
not
only
that
the
facts
in
question
are
not
the
switching
cars
utilized
both
--
switching
cars
and
other
things
merely
incident
to
greater
--
but
not
in
fact
(inaudible).
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
do
they
say
anything
comparable
to
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
you
switch
a
movement
when
there
might
still
be
of
extension
of
the
tracks
--
the
movement
that
differs
from
the
track.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
long,
that
--
that
language
that
you
just
spoke
of
if
there
were
any
frivolous
switching
movement,
and
that
concludes
the
paragraph
it
says,
through
the
use
of
connecting
--
connecting
tracks,
best
as
established
a
through
route
into
the
facts
and
which
is
stated
in
(inaudible)
or
to
this
system
the
situation
or
(inaudible).
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
long,
how
are
you
going
to
argue
to
this
fact
by
skipping
the
fact
that
you
have
understood
the
fact
that
it
was
an
extension,
i
didn't
want
to
find
whether
the
strip
of
the
record
that
the
commission
concludes
that
it
was
an
extension
or
it
was
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
all
i
asked.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

danielson.
