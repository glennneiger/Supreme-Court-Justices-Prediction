justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
commission
says
that
as
probably
the
fact
here
that
his
was
not
only
a
switching
track
but
a
switching
track
between
two
different
lines
and
one
that
had
a
substantial
impact
upon
the
traffic
patterns
in
the
two
lines.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
true
or
isn't
it
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
facts
that
this
is
the
fact
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
did
have
substantial
impact
on
traffic
and
was
the
connection
between
two
lines
and
it
was
new
track
that
they
never
had
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
purpose
of
giving
the
commission
power
to
pass
upon
an
extension?
what
do
you
suppose
congress
was
attempting
to
achieve?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
your
position
would
be
the
same
if
the
two
roads
were
20
miles
apart
were
parallel
and
they
just
built
the
same
connection
between
them
and
have
exactly
the
same
function?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
they
do
nothing
else
--
do
nothing
with
it
other
than
what
they
do
with
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
do
nothing
but
that,
the
20
miles
of
track
and
you
get
the
same
result
under
even
with
100
miles.
if
all
they
did
was
to
had
interconnecting
traffic
over
this
construction.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
difference
than
they
just,
they
could've
been
200
feet
apart,
they're
20
miles
apart
running
parallel
they
just
put
a
connection
between
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
--
all
you
--
once
you
break
the
boundaries
of
the
rights
of
way,
you've
got
something
beside
the
switching
tracks?
justice
byron
r.
white
talking
about
this
case,
nobody
else
is
complaining.
justice
byron
r.
white
these
carriers
here
are
--
these
carriers
here
are
weakening
themselves
respectfully,
so
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
that
the
purpose
presented
to
me
speak
in
terms
of
what
the
carrier
has
built
the
expense
and
does
it
himself?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
owns
this
railroad?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
railroad
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
owns
the
l.s.&
i.?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
the
shipper?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
rates
change
after
this
case?
