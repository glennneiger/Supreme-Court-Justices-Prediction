justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
law
allow
that
distinction,
discrimination
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
wouldn't
it
be
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
to
draw
such
a
distinction,
if
women
need
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
question
in
connection
with
justice
brennan's
question.
i
can
understand
an
argument,
from
my
own
constitutional
ideas,
based
on
equal
protection.
it
seems
to
me
what
someone
has
done
here
deliberately
is
to
try
to
force
a
decision
on
the
broadest
possible
grounds
of
the
meaning
of
due
process
speaking
as
a
matter
of
substance,
and
to
have
us
weigh
the
facts
and
circumstances
as
to
the
advisability
of
a
law
like
this,
rather
than
leave
it
up
to
the
legislature.
as
i
understand
it,
however,
you're
abandoning
your
idea
of
any
argument
under
equal
protection
as
such?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
pitch
it
wholly
on
due
process,
with
the
broad
idea
that
we
can
look
to
see
how
reasonable
or
unreasonable
the
decision
of
the
people
of
connecticut
has
been
in
connection
with
this
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
due
process
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
nothing
but
due
process;
no
other
constitutional
provision
whatever?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
expect
us
to
determine
whether,
it's
sufficiently
shocking
to
our
sense
of
what
ought
to
be
the
law,
because
this
applies
to
married
people
only?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
sounds
to
me
like
you're
asking
us
to
follow
the
constitutional
philosophy
of
that
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
one
that
held
it
was
unconstitutional
as
i
recall
it,
for
a
state
to
try
to
regulate
the
size
of
loaves
of
bread--
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
people
were
being
defrauded,
was
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
emphasizing
that
on
the
ground
that
a
state
is
without
power
wholly
to
prohibit
the
use
of
contraceptives
that
due
process
forbids
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
basis
of
your
argument,
that
a
state
cannot
pass
a
law
which
forbids
all
people
to
use
contraceptives,
and
is
forbidden
to
do
so
by
due
process,
the
due
process
clause?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
am
â€“
using,
use
is
not
speech,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
said
not
be
denied
in
the
judgment
of
this
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
constitutional
provision
that
says
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
other
constitutional
provision
on
which
you
could
possibly
rely
upon?
justice
hugo
l.
black
again
you're
dealing
with
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
any
statistics
that
indicate
that
connecticut
people
have
been
suffering
because
of
inability
to
get
such
things?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
one's
not
a
question
of
advice,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
measure
community
standards?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
not
national
standards?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
why
you're
saying
that
if
congress
has
one
standard
it
thinks
should
be
adopted,
the
people
of
connecticut
would
be
tied
down
to
that
standard
within
their
area
of
power
to
legislate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
insist
that
that's
what
we've
got
to
decide
this
on,
as
i
understand
it;
that
we've
got
a
right
to
set
aside
state
laws
that
we
think
are
arbitrary
and
capricious,
in
our
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
one
agrees
with
you,
as
i
might,
does
that
give
me
the
right
to
say
that
connecticut
can't
have
a
different
idea?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
device
which
you're
talking
about
here
described
in
the
record?
if
so,
what
page?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
this
one.
you
said
this
one
is
not
that
kind.
is
it
described
in
the
record?
i
won't
ask
you
to
describe
it.
[laughter]
i
just
want
to
see
where
it's
described.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they're
adequately
described
in
the
record
of
each
of
the
women
they
state
specifically
what
each
device
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
you're
quite
correct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
don't
have
to
meet
that
question,
do
we?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
been
some
statements
in
your
argument
about
the
difference
between
a
business
institution
and
somebody
that's
not
a
business
institution.
is
the
statement
of
facts
about
how
this
clinic
operates
correct
as
made
in
the
court's
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
a
business
institution,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
do
they
get
paid
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
gets
the
fees,
the
public?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
the
doctor
get?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
mrs.
griswold
get?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
she
get
out
of
this
clinic?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
statement
correct,
however,
as
given
by
the
court's
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
she
got
a
salary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
asking
that
with
the
idea
that
i
think
that
raises,
makes
a
constitutional
difference,
but
because
some
suggestion
has
been
made
that
it
might?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
your
argument
concerning
these
things
you've
been
talking
about
relating
to
privacy,
invalidate
all
laws
that
punish
people
for
bringing
about
abortions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
is
some
privacy,
as
a
rule,
and
the
individual
doesn't
generally
want
it
made
known,
it's
private
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
part
of
it
goes
on
in
the
home,
undoubtedly?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
that
all
abortions
involve
killing
of
murder?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
state
thinks
each
of
them
is
wrong,
and
it
passes
a
law
to
forbid
it
being
done.
it
relates
to
a
pretty
closely
analogous
situation
