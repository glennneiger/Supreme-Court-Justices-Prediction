mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
validity
of
the
connecticut
anti-contraceptives
statutes.
there
are
two
statutes
involved,
which
are
printed
on
page
three
of
our
brief.
the
first
one,
which
i
will
refer
to
as
the
"use
statute,"
provides
that
any
person
who
uses
any
drug,
medicinal
article
or
instrument
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
conception
is
guilty
of
a
crime;
and
the
second
statute,
the
"accessory
statute,"
provides
that
anyone
who
assists,
abets,
counsels,
and
so
on,
another
to
commit
any
offense
may
be
punished
as
if
he
were
the
principal
offender.
there
is
no
dispute
concerning
the
facts
of
the
case,
at
least
so
far
as
i
know.
following
the
decision
of
this
court
in
poe
against
ulmin
in
1961,
there
was
opened
in
new
haven
the
planned
parenthood
center,
and
this
was
in
november
of
1961.
the
purpose
of
the
center
was
to
provide
information,
instruction
and
medical
advice
to
married
persons
as
to
the
means
of
preventing
conception,
and
to
educate
married
persons
generally
as
to
such
means
and
methods,
that
was
the
finding
of
the
court
in
this
case.
dr.
buxton,
one
of
the
appellants
here,
was
medical
director
of
the
center.
dr.
buxton
is
chief
of
the
department
of
obstetrics
and
gynecology
at
yale
medical
school,
and
one
of
the
leading
authorities
in
his
field.
mrs.
griswold,
the
other
appellant
here,
was
acting
director
of
the
center.
she
is
executive
director
of
the
planned
parenthood
league
of
connecticut,
and
she
was
in
charge
of
the
administration
of
the
center
and
its
educational
program.
the
center
functioned
in
a
suite
of
eight
rooms
in
a
building
in
new
haven.
it
had
a
staff
of
doctors
and
nurses,
as
well
as
mrs.
griswold.
the
procedure
was
that,
when
a
married
woman
came
to
the
center,
she
was
interviewed,
her
case
history
was
taken,
and
various
forms
of
contraception
were
explained
to
her.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
i
do
not
know,
your
honor,
except
that,
in
asking
questions
and
taking
the
case
history,
i
assume
that
it
was
accepted
if
she
said
she
was
married,
but
i'm
not
sure
what
the
arrangements
for
that
was.
there
is
no
question
in
the
case,
but
that
the
center
functioned
only
for
the
purpose
of
helping
married
women.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes,
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
if
an
unmarried
woman
got
services,
it
would
be
through
misrepresentation
and
mistake.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
that's
right,
your
honor;
that's
right,
yes.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
that's
right,
yeah,
yeah.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
the
law
makes
no
distinction
between
married
and
unmarried
women,
but
our
objection
to
it,
essentially,
goes
only
to
the
application
to
married
women.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well,
it
might
be,
and
i
will
argue
that
it
does
operate
discriminatorily,
your
honor.
the
equal
protection
question
as
such
was
not
raised
in
this
case
and
there
might
be
differences
between
–
there
are
differences
between
married
and
unmarried
women
for
purposes
of
legislation
in
this
area.
so
that
the
mere
fact
of
distinction
would
not
necessarily
be
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
by
virtue
of
the
accessory
statute.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes,
it
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
there
have
been
no
prosecutions
for
sale,
your,
honor.
the
only
prosecutions,
actually,
have
been
in
the
case
of
clinics,
where
the
prosecutions
have
been
brought
against
doctors,
nurses
and
assistants.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
that's
right,
your
honor.
in
just
one
minute
i'll
get
to
the
interpretation,
the
connecticut
state
interpretation
of
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no.
well,
the
statute
applies
without
exception,
to
prevent
the
use
of
contraceptives
for
purposes
of
preventing
conception.
the
statute
does
not
apply
to
the
use
or
sale
of
contraceptives
for
purposes
of
preventing
disease.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
they
are
sold
in
connecticut
for
purposes
of
preventing
disease.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
we
are
not
arguing
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
such
in
this
case,
no.
it
was
not
raised
in
that
way.
we
do
say
that
the
statute
does
operate
discriminatorily,
and
as
part
of
our
due
process
argument.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no.
well,
there's
no
statute
which
says
that.
it's
simply
that
the
statute
doesn't
cover
the
use
or
sale
of
contraceptives
for
preventing
disease.
that
applies
to
anybody,
yes.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
that's
right,
that's
right.
the
center
functioned
for
ten
days,
and
then
at
that
time
dr.
buxton
and
mrs.
griswold
were
arrested
and
the
center
closed
down.
informations
were
filed
against
the
two
appellants
here,
and
demurrers
were
filed
to
those
informations,
challenging
the
statute
on
due
process
grounds
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
first
amendment
–
freedom
of
speech
grounds
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
the
demurrers
were
overruled.
there
was
a
trial
before
the
court
without
a
jury;
and
findings
of
fact
were
subsequently
made
which
state
the
basis
of
the
court's
position.
the
evidence
show
that
dr.
buxton
had
not
only
been
medical
director
of
the
center,
and
had
made
the
medical
decisions
in
setting
it
up,
but
he
also
had
functioned
as
a
physician
during
the
operation
of
the
center
on
several
occasions,
and
had
examined
patients
and
given
them
contraceptive
advice.
the
evidence
show
that
mrs.
griswold
had
taken
case
histories,
had
discussed
methods
of
contraception
with
married
women
who
came
to
the
center,
and
on
one
occasion
had
given
contraceptive
materials
to
one
of
the
women.
there
was
testimony
of
three
married
women
who
had
come
to
the
center,
had
gone
through
the
procedure
which
i
have
described,
and
were
given
contraceptive
materials,
and
thereafter
used
them.
the
defendants
were
convicted,
sentenced
to
a
fine
of
one
hundred
dollars
each.
appeals
were
taken
to
the
appellate
division
and
the
supreme
court
of
ours,
which
affirmed
the
convictions.
the
appellants
at
all
times--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
the
sentence
was
a
fine
of
a
hundred
dollars
each.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes,
in
the
case
of
the
doctor
the
right
to
–
the
license
to
practice
medicine
may
be
involved.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not.
the
doctor's
right
is
the
right
to
engage
in
the
practice
of
his
profession
as
a
property
right,
and
we
think
that
an
equal
property
right
to
engage
in
an
occupation
exists
in
the
case
of
mrs.
griswold.
in
addition,
she
was
an
assistant
to
the
doctor,
so
she
comes
in
under
the
rights
that
pertain
to
the
doctor.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well,
we
do
claim,
your
honor,
that
the
operation
of
the
statute
is
to
violate
his
right
to
practice
medicine
in
accordance
with
scientifically
accepted
principles,
and
in
that
respect
the
fact
that
he
is
a
doctor
does
make
a
difference,
but
the
initial
constitutional
right
with
which
he
starts,
the
right
to
practice
a
profession
or
the
right
to
engage
in
an
occupation,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
the
same
in
both
cases.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes,
i
think
so.
now--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes.
i
mean,
there
would
be
questions
of
whether
she
was
licensed
to
practice,
but
assuming
that
she
was
operating
in
the
same
manner
as
the
doctor,
i
would
see
no
difference.
the
major
interpretation
of
the
connecticut
statute
is
not
in
dispute,
either.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes.
in
addition--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
not
in
connecticut,
your
honor.
the
massachusetts
courts,
which
have
a
somewhat
similar
statute,
have
interpreted
their
statute
as
not
applying
to
the
sale
of
contraceptives
for
the
prevention
of
disease
and
the
connecticut
courts
have
cited
with
approval
those
massachusetts
decisions,
so
that
we
say
that,
in
effect,
the
connecticut
courts
have
taken
that
position,
but
there
is
no
direct
ruling
by
a
connecticut
court
on
that
point,
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well,
you
mean
that
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well,
i
didn't
–
i
wasn't
participating
in
the
case
at
an
earlier
stage,
your
honor,
but
the
equal
protection
–
there
are
differences
between
married
and
unmarried
persons,
and
between
the
use
of
devices
for
preventing
conception
and
the
use
for
preventing
disease
–-
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
-–
and
it's
conceivable
that
the
state
legislature
could
validly
make
discrimination
between
them
in
some
situations.
i
think
we
do
–
i
think
we
satisfy
your
suggestion
for
an
argument
under
the
equal
protection
clause
in
the
sense
that
we
do
argue
that
the
discriminatory
nature
and
application
of
the
statutes
are
one
of
the
reasons
why
they
are
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
under
the
due
process
clause.
but
we
have
not
made
an
argument
that
it
is
unreasonable
to
leave
out
the
use
for
the
prevention
of
disease
as
an
equal
protection
argument.
it
seems
to
us
it's
inconsistent
with
the
whole
philosophy
of
the
statute,
but
we
have
not
made
it
as
an
equal
protection
argument.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
it
would
dispose
of
the
statute,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
that,
your
honor.
the
question
was
asked
about
that
at
the
trial
and
the
evidence
was
excluded.
i
can
however
say
from
my
own
information
that
they
are
on
sale
in
the
drugstores
for
the
prevention
of
disease.
they
are,
at
least
technically,
not
on
sale
for
any
other
purpose.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
they're
not
normally
on
display,
your
honor.
they're
under
the
counter,
but
there's
no
problem
in
obtaining
them
if
you
ask
for
them.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
certain
devices
must
be
sold
on
physician's
prescription,
of
course,
and
can
be
obtained
only
on
prescription
from
a
physician,
but
others
which
do
not
require
such
a
prescription
can
be
obtained
without
it
at
the
drugstore.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
we
have
never
made
any
argument
on
equal
protection
as
such,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
we
pitch
it
an
due
process
in
the
basic
sense,
yes,
that
it
is
arbitrary
and
unreasonable,
and
in
the
special
sense
that
it
constitutes
a
deprivation
of
right
against
invasion
of
privacy.
the
privacy
argument
is
a
substantially
narrower
one
than
the
general
argument.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
that's
correct.
they're
both
due
process;
they're
both
due
process.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well,
we
also
argue
the
first
amendment,
your
honor.
we
have
a
first
amendment
argument.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
we
argued
the
ninth
amendment
as
part
of
the
privacy
–-
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
-–
well,
the
ninth
amendment
wasn't
clearly
raised
below
either,
your
honor,
and
in
that
sense
we
didn't
feel
that
we
could
pitch
it
squarely
on
the
ninth
amendment.
so
we
refer
to
that
as
a
basis
for
the
right
of
privacy.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes,
your
honor,
but
it
is
not
broad
due
process
in
the
sense
in
which
the
issue
was
raised
in
the
1930's.
in
the
first
place,
this
is
not
a
regulation
that
deals
with
economic
or
commercial
matters.
it
is
a
regulation
that
touches
upon
individual
rights:
the
right
to
protect
life
and
health,
the
right
of
advancing
scientific
knowledge,
the
right
to
have
children
voluntarily
and
therefore,
we
say
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
revive
lochner
against
new
york,
or
to
overrule
nebbia
or
west
coast
hotel.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
your
honor.
we
are
asking
you
to
follow
the
philosophy
of
meyer
against
nebraska
and
pierce
against
the
society
of
sisters,
which
dealt
with
meyer
against
nebraska
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
no,
no.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
that
was
the
lochner
case,
your
honor
–-
meyer
against
nebraska
held
that
it
was
unconstitutional
for
a
state
to
enact
a
law
prohibiting
the
teaching
of
the
german
language
to
children
who
had
not
passed
the
eighth
grade.
and
pierce
against
the
society
of
sisters
held
that
it
was
unconstitutional
for
a
state
to
prevent
the
operation
of
private
schools
in
the
state.
and
those
were
bath
due
process
cases,
were
decided
as
due
process
cases
and
the
aptheker
case,
well,
i
would
bring
within
this
rule
the
schware
case,
schware
against
the
board
of
bar
examiners,
and
the
aptheker
case
most
recently,
all
were
due
process
cases
which
related
to
individual
rights
and
liberties,
and
we
distinguish
those
from
the
cases
which
involved
commercial
operations
like
lochner
against
new
york
and
west
coast
hotel
against
parrish.
we
make
that
very
definite
distinction.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well,
it
was
a
due
process
–
it
was
a
very
–-
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
-–
yes,
but
that's
the
same
kind
of
due
process
argument
we're
making
here,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
that's
right.
so
it's
an
undue
breadth's
argument
very
similar
to
the
aptheker
argument
and,
mr.
justice
black,
when
i
get
a
little
further
along,
i
think
i'll
also
narrow
the
issue
down
somewhat
further,
even.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes.
let
me
first
say
one
further
thing
in
a
preliminary
way
with
respect
to
the
interpretation
of
the
statute.
the
connecticut
courts
are
clear
that
the
"use
statute"
has
been
–
the
use
statute
prohibits
by
criminal
process
any
use
of
contraceptive
devices
for
prevention
of
conception.
and
there
is
no
exception
to
that
statute,
it
applies
to
married
persons,
to
married
couples.
it
applies
to
a
woman
whose
health
is
such
that
a
further
pregnancy
would
be
dangerous,
or
perhaps
fatal.
it
applies
even
though
there
is
a
doctor's
prescription
based
upon
scientific
and
medical
grounds,
it
applies
without
exception.
on
the
other
hand,
as
i
indicated,
it
is
not
an
offense
to
sell
these
same
devices
for,
or
to
use
them
for,
purposes
of
preventing
disease
and
the
accessory
statute
prevents
a
doctor
from
prescribing
them
for
prevention
of
conception
and
prevents
their
sale
for
prevention
of
conception.
now,
the
connecticut
statute
is
a
unique
statute.
there
is
no
other
statute
dealing
with
this
problem
that
makes
it
a
criminal
offense
to
use
contraceptive
devices.
in
that
respect
it
is
totally
unique.
the
only
statute,
other
statute,
which
is
somewhat
comparable,
is
the
massachusetts
statute.
the
massachusetts
statute
prohibits
the
sale
or
giving
away
or
displaying
of
contraceptive
devices
for
prevention
of
conception.
it
is
different
in
that
it
applies
to
the
sale,
not
the
use,
but
it
is
the
same
as
the
connecticut
statute
in
that
it
has
been
interpreted
to
apply
without
exception.
it
applies
to
married
persons,
doctors,
physicians,
and
so
forth.
now,
the
statutes
are
collected
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
of
the
planned
–
amicus
brief
for
the
planned
parenthood
federation,
here.
i
will
not
go
into
them
further,
except
to
say
that
there
is
no
other
statute,
either
state
or
federal,
which
has
been
interpreted
in
this
way
or
applied
in
this
way.
either
by
express
language
of
the
statute
or
by
judicial
interpretation,
or
by
application
of
the
executive
officials
charged
with
enforcement,
all
the
other
statutes
allow
at
least
the
use
of
contraceptives
for
purposes
of
preventing
conception
and
their
sale
on
doctor's
prescription
or
through
some
pharmaceutical
arrangement
or
something
of
that
sort.
there
are
no
others
like
the
connecticut
statute
or
the
massachusetts
statute.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
they
have
the
power
to
prohibit
as
to
married
couples,
within
the
marriage
relationship,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
that's
correct,
your
honor,
yes
and
also,
the
first
amendment
clause,
in
this
case
at
least.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
it
isn't,
your
honor.
that's
a
different
argument.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes,
your
honor,
i
disagree
with
that
statement.
only
massachusetts
law
would
have
been
violated
by
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
minnesota
and
the
new
york
laws
prohibit
sale,
except
on
a
doctor's
prescription,
and
the
wording
is,
"for
use
–
for
the
cure
or
prevention
of
disease."
they
can
be
sold
in
minnesota
and
new
york
on
doctor's
prescription
for
the
cure
and
prevention
of
disease,
but
the
court
in
new
york
in
the
sanger
case
and
in
later
cases
has
interpreted
that
language
to
mean,
"for
the
purpose
of
promoting
general
health
and
well-being."
so
that
new
york
does
have
birth
control
clinics
operating
in
new
york
city
and
the
new
york
–
and
the
minnesota
statute
similarly
is
classified
as
statutes
allowing
sale
on
prescription
of
physician
for
purposes
of
general
health
and
well-being.
the
mississippi,
missouri
and
nebraska
statutes
do
on
their
face
sound
like
the
massachusetts
statute.
they
are
statutes
prohibiting
sale,
but
they
have
never
been
interpreted
that
way,
well
i'm
not
sure
there
are
any
court
decisions,
they
have
never
been
applied
that
way
in
those
states,
and
there
are
in
those
states
birth
control
clinics
operating,
either
by
the
government
or
by
planned
parenthood.
so
that,
although
on
their
face
those
statutes
would
apply,
they
have
never
been
utilized
in
that
way,
and
the
center
would
have
been
allowed
to
operate
in
those
states.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well,
your
honor,
the
–
many
of
these
statutes
started
out
with
language
similar
to
the
massachusetts
statute.
as
far
as
i
know
there
are
no
other
use
statutes,
but
have
been
interpreted,
as
the
federal
statutes
have,
not
to
apply
except
to
unlawful
uses,
in
effect.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes,
those
are
the
statutes
which
prohibit
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
--mailing
or
transportation
in
interstate
commerce
or
importation
of
articles
designed
to
prevent
conception.
they
were
interpreted
from
beginning
–
well,
the
leading
case
which
we
cite
is
united
states
against
one
package,
a
decision
of
the
second
circuit
in
1936,
which
held
that
they
prevented
only
the
transportation
of
contraceptive
devices
for
unlawful
purposes,
illegal
abortions
or
unlawful
purposes
and
did
not
prevent
their
transportation
where
those
purposes
did
not
exist.
so
that
contraceptive
devices
do
–
are
sent
through
the
mails
now,
do
move
in
interstate
commerce,
and
that
language,
which
could
have
been
interpreted
the
way
the
massachusetts
legislation
was,
has
not
been
so
interpreted.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
your
honor,
it
depends
on
what
ground
we
prevail.
if
we
prevail
on
the
privacy
ground;
that
would
probably
end
only
the
connecticut
statute,
because
the
connecticut
statute
is
the
only
use
statute.
if
we
prevail
on
the
further,
basic
due
process
ground,
it
would,
i
think,
end
the
massachusetts
statute
because
that
ground
holds
it
arbitrary
to
apply
any
such
statute
with
respect
to
the
married
relation.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
the
federal
statutes
would
continue
as
they
are.
they
have
been
interpreted
so
that
they
don't
raise
any
of
these
questions,
and
i
would
say
that
is
true
of
all
the
other
statutes,
so
far
as
i'm
aware.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
they
have
been
interpreted
as
not
to
raise
these
questions
because
they
don't
prevent
the
shipment
of
contraceptives
for
use
by
married
couples
within
the
marital
relationship.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
the
united
states
against
one
package
is
the
leading
federal
case
on
that,
your
honor.
it's
cited
on
page
24
of
our
brief.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
that's
a
second
circuit--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
1936,
yes.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
there's
been
nothing
in
this
court
i
think,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well,
you're
correct,
your
honor.
i
was
speaking
rather
broadly
there,
because
it's
quite
true
that
many
of
the
privacy
arguments
would
apply
to
the
sale
statutes,
some
of
them
don't
and
therefore,
you
don't
have
as
clear
cut
a
privacy
argument
with
respect
to
the
sale
statutes.
i
should
have
put
it
in
those
terms.
i
was
stating
it
too
generally.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well,
because,
your
honor,
the
question
is
why
is
it
over
broad?
the
reason
that
it
is
over
broad
is
because
it
denies
rights
to
married
couples
that
should
not
be
denied
and
therefore,
that
would
be
true
equally
of
the
use
statute
or
the
sales
statute,
i
think.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
we're
relying
on
the
due
process
clause,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
we
rely
on
the
third,
fourth
and
fifth
amendments,
insofar
as
they
embody
a
concept
of
a
right
of
privacy,
your
honor,
which
are
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
since
this
is
state
legislation.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
it
could
very
well
be,
your
honor.
certainly
the
ninth
amendment
meant
to
reserve
some
rights
to
the
people,
and
if
there's
any
right
that
you
would
think
would
he
reserved
to
the
people
and
which
the
government
would
not
interfere
with,
it
would
be
this
right,
yes.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
history,
your
honor.
methods
of
contraception
have
been
used
for
ages,
of
various
types,
and
what
the
state
of
the
art
was
in
1879,
i'm
not
exactly
sure.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes,
there
has
been,
your
honor.
there
has
been
a
very
substantial
development,
particularly
with
respect
to
intra-uterine
devices,
and
also
the
oral
contraceptives,
the
pills.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
it's
probably
only
true
with
respect
to
some,
but
some
get
by
under
the
term
"feminine
hygiene,"
and
others
i
just
don't
know
about,
but
they
are
all
sold
in
connecticut
drugstores
on
one
theory
or
another.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well,
there
are
so
many
other
factors
involved,
your
honor,
that
it
would
be
hard,
i
think,
to
isolate
this.
connecticut's
birth
rate
is,
i
believe,
in
excess
of
that
of
the
nation.
i
think
at
least
the
increase
of
its
population
from
1950
to
1960
was
something
like
26
percent,
and
the
rest
of
the
nation's
population
was
18
percent,
but
that
may
involve
a
lot
of
mobility
between
states,
people
moving
between
states,
and
so
forth.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
it
doesn't
prove
it
either
way,
i
think,
your
honor.
that
factor
cannot
be
really
isolated
that
way,
i
think.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
there
are
no
statistics,
your
honor,
but
the
effect
of
the
operation
of
the
statutes
is
that
people
who
are
too
poor
to
have
private
physicians
or
too
uninformed
to
know
about
these
matters
do
not
get
the
services.
and
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
there
would
be
room
for
an
important
work
in
terms
of
giving
people
advice
and
information
and
instruction
with
respect
to
contraceptive
services
when
they
wanted
it
in
connecticut.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
this
involved
more
than
advice,
your
honor,
that's
true.
it
also
involved
some
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
the
first
amendment
argument
is
based
on
the
advice
aspects
of
the
case.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
there
was
yes.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
there
was
yeas,
there
was
i
would
say,
examination
of
patients,
prescription
of
a
device,
furnishing
a
device,
all
of
those
would
seem
to
me
action
and
not
within
the
first
amendment
protection.
in
addition,
there
was
advice
to
married
women
generally,
and
the
aiding
and
abetting
statute
includes
not
only
assisting
and
abetting,
but
counseling,
and
that
part
of
it,
we
think,
would
make
the
statute
void
on
its
face.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
i
cover
that,
your
honor,
yes.
one
major
reason
is
that
there
is
no
violation
of
the
accessory
statute
unless
there
is
a
violation
of
the
principal
statute.
so
that
the
appellants'
rights
are
the
same
as
the
patients'
rights,
because,
if
the
patients
were
acting
constitutionally,
so
were
the
appellants,
but
there
are
other
reasons.
i
think
there
is
no
real
problem
about
that.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
your
honor.
they
would
have
violated
the
law
if
they
go
to
the
doctor,
but
the
law
has
not
been
enforced
against
private
practitioners,
as
this
court
so
held
in
poe
against
ulmin.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes,
it
has
been
enforced
against
the
clinics
since
1937.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
your
honor.
the
initial
case,
state
against
nelson,
was
a
criminal
case
against
a
doctor
and
a
nurse
who
were
operating
one
of
nine
clinics
that
were
then
operating
in
connecticut.
that
was
–
1940
was
the
decision
of
the
connecticut
state
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
it
wasn't
prosecuted
because
the
clinics
closed
down.
the
waterbury
clinic,
which
was
the
one
involved,
closed
down,
and
the
other
eight
closed
down,
and
no
clinic
has
opened
in
connecticut
since
then.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
it
went
up
on
the
demurrer,
of
course,
so
that
when
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
ruled
that
the
statute
should
be
interpreted
as
applying
to
this
situation,
even
though
there
was
a
doctor's
prescription,
that
settled
the
legal
issue
so
far
as
connecticut
was
concerned;
that
it
was
a
violation.
at
that
point,
clinics
no
longer
operated.
i'm
not
exactly
sure
when
it
actually
closed
down,
but
the
result
of
the
nelson
case,
even
though
there
was
no
ultimate
conviction,
the
result
of
the
nelson
case
was
to
close
down
all
the
clinics
and
this
clinic
was
closed
down,
or
at
least
the
participants
were
arrested,
within
ten
days
after
it
opened.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
there's
no
difference
in
the
interpretation,
your
honor.
the
law
would
be
interpreted
to
make
it
a
criminal
offense
for
a
private
practitioner
to
do
this
as
well
as
a
physician
in
the
clinic.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
that's
the
basis
of
the
poe
case,
your
honor.
it
isn't
enforced
against
doctors.
it
isn't
enforced
against
private
practitioners
or
individuals.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor
what
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well,
your
honor,
i
was
not
in
the
earlier
stages
of
the
case.
i'm
afraid
that
you'll
have
to
ask
them.
[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
we
have
not
made
an
equal
–
no
we
have
not
made
an
equal
protection
argument
as
such.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
the
record
does
not
show
that,
but
that
was
the
basis
of
poe
against
ulmin,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well,
i'm
not
getting
far
on
any
of
my
arguments
[laughter]
but
i
can't
guarantee
that
i'll
get
back
to
the
first
amendment,
no.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
let
me
just
outline
the
argument
on
due
process.
it
proceeds
along
two
lines.
the
first
is
that
this
is
an
enactment
of
a
principle
of
morality
which
has
no
objective
relation
to
any
material
welfare
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
to
material
welfare,
i
said,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well,
or
measurable
welfare.
it's
a
moral
principle;
it's
a
religious
principle
that's
being
enacted
into
law,
that
it
is
immoral
to
use
contraceptives
even
within
the
marriage
relation,
and
therefore
it
can
be
made
an
offense.
that
is
the
aspect
of
the
statute
we're
dealing
with
at
this
purpose.
and
i
say
that
is
purely
a
moral
judgment,
which
cannot
be
measured
by
objective
circumstances.
there
is
nothing
harmful
about
a
contraceptive
devices,
either
to
the
individual
or
to
other
individuals.
there
are
–
they
are
useful
and
important
for
solving
many
medical
problems.
the
woman
who
cannot
have
another
child
without
incurring
ill
health
or
death
has
no
other
solution
to
that
medical
problem,
no
other
effective
solution,
than
the
use
of
contraceptive
devices
or
abstinence.
and
consequently,
there
is
no
moral,
there
was
no
objective
basis
for
the
statutes
in
this
respect,
except
the
moral
principle
and
we
say
that
the
state
cannot
enact
such
an
abstract
moral
principle,
unless
it
is
one
that
conforms
to
current
community
standards,
and
that
this
statute
does
not.
the
government
projects,
programs,
are
widespread
at
the
federal,
state
and
local
level,
in
which
contraceptive
devices
are
used.
the
congress
of
the
united
states
last
session
appropriated
funds
for
the
district
of
columbia
to
create
birth
control
clinics
in
the
district
of
columbia
using
contraceptive
devices.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
the
material
on
that
is
developed
at
some
length
in
our
briefs,
your
honor,
but
the
point
i'm
making
now
is
that,
if
the
government
–
it
can
scarcely
be
said
to
be
contrary
to
current
community
standards
if
the
government
itself
does
it.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well,
this
was
the
federal
congress.
yes,
think
this
is
a
case
of
–
i
realize
there
is
problem
of
the
national
and
local
standards,
and
i
hope
i
don't
get
involved
in
that
at
the
moment.[laughter]
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well,
your
honor,
that's
–
in
the
first
place,
there
would
be
a
number
of
people
moving
in
and
out
of
connecticut
that
would
be
affected.
and
i
think,
for
the
same
reasons
that
prevail
in
the
obscenity
cases,
the
national
standard
is
the
one
i
think
should
be
applied
here.
however,
let
me
simply
take
a
moment
to
develop
the
other
phase
of
the
due
process
argument,
which
is
the
reasons
why
we
think
that
using
the
stricter
standards,
this
nevertheless
falls
under
the
doctrine
that
a
law
cannot
be
arbitrary
or
capricious.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
in
the
field
of
individual
liberty,
your
honor,
in
a
field
where
the
laws
not
only
affect
important
individual
rights,
but
are
quite
inconsistent
and
arbitrary
in
their
application
–
the
laws
in
relation
to
contraception
and
abortion
and
sterilization
make
no
sense
whatever
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
your
honor,
no.
obviously,
we
don't
press
the
issue
that
far.
we
do
say
that
in
the
field
of
individual
liberties,
and
in
the
field
where
the
individual
is
entitled
to
some
private
sector
against
which
government
is
forbidden
to
intrude,
in
that
narrow
area,
unless
the
state
can
make
an
overwhelming
case
for
intrusion
which
destroys
the
right
to
decide
whether
to
have
children
voluntarily,
whether
to
be
able
to
maintain
health
and
the
very
life
of
the
individual,
when
the
state
makes
decisions
which
affect
those
rights,
then,
unless
it
has
an
overwhelming
case
and
i
submit
that
here
it
doesn't
have
that
kind
of
a
case
and
i
have
not
had
time
to
outline
the
reasons
or
to
catalog
the
injustices
or
the
absurdities
of
this
statute,
but
they
are
set
forth
in
our
brief.
i
also
have
not
had
time
to
discuss
the
privacy
argument
or
the
first
amendment
argument,
but
i
do
want
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
with
respect
to
the
standing
question
and
the
right
of
the
appellants
in
this
case
to
assert
the
constitutional
rights
that
are
involved
in
the
use
statute,
i
call
attention
of
the
court
to
the
shuttlesworth
case,
which
–
last
term
which
raised
that
same
issue.
so
far
as
appellants
raising
the
broad
issues
in
this
case,
we
point
out
in
our
brief
in
the
footnote
on
page
16
those
sections
of
the
record
in
which
all
the
issues
that
are
now
urged
before
this
court
were
consistently
raised
in
the
courts
below.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
possible
legislation
in
connecticut,
i
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
fact
that
that
would
not
solve
the
issue
of
the
two
defendants
who
have
been
convicted
in
this
particular
case.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
enforcement,
regardless
of
the
issues
of
whether
or
not
there
have
been
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
i'm
not
sure
about
that,
your
honor,
or
quite
how
that
would
operate.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
i'm
sorry?
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes,
i
realize
your
reference
but
i'm
not
sure
how
it
would
apply
in
the
connecticut
situation
or
what
the
court
might
do
with
it
if
it
got
back
here.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
mno,
you're
right,
your
honor.
[attempt
to
laughter]
on
the
question
of
enforcement,
apart
from
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
are
sporadic
cases
brought,
the
issue
before
the
court
is,
and
the
fact
is,
that
the
statutes
are
being
enforced
against
clinics.
dr.
buxton
has
been
convicted
for
his
participation
in
a
clinic,
and
that
is
the
key
issue
with
respect
to
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
here.
now,
what
this
means
is
not
only
that
contraceptive
devices
are
not
available
as
such
to
persons
who
cannot
afford
to
go
to
private
doctors,
but
that
the
whole
range
of
medical
services
which
are
supplied
by
a
clinic
are
not
available
to
those
people.
the
medical
services
which
are
necessary
in
health
cases,
and
particularly
the
newly-developed
devices
in
the
contraceptive
field,
require
medical
supervision.
all
of
those
services
are
not
available
to
many
citizens
of
connecticut
who
cannot
afford
private
practitioners.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
your
honor,
by
"apply"
i
meant
it
isn't
enforced
as
to
them.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
it's
enforced
against
the
operation
of
a
clinic.
it
has
not
–
there
have
been
no
cases
in
which
a
physician
has
been
prosecuted
outside,
apart
from
the
clinic
cases.
it
has
not
been
enforced
as
to
them.
i'm
not
saying
it
has
no
impact
upon
them,
because
it
applies
to
them
and
they
would
be
violating
the
law,
and
in
that
sense
it
applies
to
them,
but
it
has
never
been
enforced
as
to
them.
also,
i
was
thinking
of
situations
where
the
patient
could
go
outside
the
state
for
medical
advice,
but
the
important
point
about
the
enforcement,
your
honor,
is
that
it
is
enforced
as
to
the
centers,
and
not
only
as
to
planned
parenthood
centers,
but
as
to
hospitals
and
any
other
public
facility.
so
that
all
the
people
who
rely
on
facilities
of
that
sort
are
denied
medical
supervision
in
this
important
field.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
the
reason
i
say
it
is
not
applied
to
doctors
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
the
reason
i
say
that,
your
honor,
is
because
that
is
what,
as
i
understand,
poe
against
ullman
decided,
that
it
was
not
applied
to
doctors
and
the
record
does
not
throw
any
more
light
on
that.
i'm
relying
on
the
decision
in
poe
against
ullman.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
but
there's
no
indication
that
the
situation
has
changed.
i
just
didn't
want
to
fight
poe
against
ullman
over
again
at
this
point.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
there's
nothing
further
in
this
record,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
would
say
that,
essentially,
the
matter
is
not
the
most
significant
aspect
of
the
case.
it's
a
secondary
matter,
because
the
important
thing
here
is
that
it
is
being
enforced
against
dr.
buxton
and
mrs.
griswold,
and
it
is
being
enforced
in
a
way
which
denies
medical
services
to
a
great
many
people.
and
i
perhaps
didn't
answer
sufficiently
the
question
yesterday
as
to
what
the
people
of
connecticut
were
suffering
as
a
result
of
this
statute.
the
fact
is
that
a
great
many
people
in
connecticut
are
denied
medical
supervision
in
an
area
of
great
importance
to
them,
and
it
is
a
matter
of
great
importance
to
a
great
number
of
people
in
connecticut.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
people
against
sanger
is
not
a
precedent
in
this
case,
your
honor.
that
involved
a
prosecution
of
margaret
sanger
in
new
york
under
the
new
york
statute
which
prohibited
the
dispensing
of
contraceptives
except
by
physicians.
she
was
not
a
physician,
and
that
was
the
issue
of
the
case,
that
since
she
was
not
a
physician
she
was
covered
by
the
statute.
and
there
is
no
such
question
in
this
case,
because
we
would
not
say
that
a
state
law
which
provided
for
the
dissemination
of
contraceptives
through
a
method
of
prescription
by
physicians
would
violate
constitutional
rights.
so
that
was
not
involved.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
it
was
a
prosecution
under
the
new
york
statute.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
her
claim
was
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
it
was
not
based
on
that
grounds.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
i'm
sorry.
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
i
think
it
was
a
due
process,
first
amendment
claim.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
i
think
that
case
is
not
significant.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
the
gardner
case
is
much
closer,
and
all
i
can
say
on
that
is
that
the
court
simply
dismissed
the
appeal.
the
gardner
case
involved
the
validity
of
the
massachusetts
statute,
which
was
a
sale
statute,
and
interpreted
the
statute
to
be
without
exception,
as
the
connecticut
statute
has
been
interpreted.
similar
questions
were
raised.
so
that,
so
far
as
the
sale
aspects
of
it
are
concerned,
it's
a
very
similar
case.
it
did
not
involve
the
use
aspect
and
all
the
privacy
questions
that
are
involved
in
the
use
aspect.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
i
made
no
distinction,
apart
from
the
question
of
the
requirements
that
a
person
have
a
license
to
practice
medicine
and
so
on,
those
aspects
of
the
case
which,
of
course,
are
different.
i
would
say
that
dissemination
–
that
in
this
case
there
is
no
difference,
because
the
statute
prohibits
dissemination
by
any
person.
and
therefore,
whether
it
was
the
physician
or
whether
it
was
an
assistant
to
the
physician,
in
that
case
they're
both
in
the
same
–
have
the
same
rights
in
that
respect.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
it
is
not
a
business
institution.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well,
there
was
a
sliding
scale
of
fees,
ranging
from
nothing
to
fifteen
dollars.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
it's
run
by
a
nonprofit
organization,
planned
parenthood.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
the
doctor
serves
without
fee.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes.
i'm
quite
certain
about
that,
your
honor.
there
is
no
element
of
profit
in
this
whatsoever.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
she
was
executive
director
of
the
planned
parenthood
league
of
connecticut.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
i
think
nothing,
your
honor.
i
think
there
was
no
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
i
didn't
recollect
that
the
court
said--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
she
got
a
salary
from
planned
parenthood
league
of
connecticut,
which
sponsored
the
center,
but
she
got
no
salary
from
the
center.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes,
i
think
clearly
so,
your
honor,
because,
in
the
first
place,
it
would
really
make
no
sense
for
this
court
to
rule
on
the
narrow
issue
of
the
three
women
that
happened
to
be
called
as
witnesses
in
this
case;
and
then,
if
it
decided
as
to
them
one
way,
the
clinic
would
then
operate,
and
the
next
day
three
more
women
would
come
in
and
raise
different
questions.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
sound
judicial
administration
in
taking
it
on
that
narrow
a
view,
when
actually
it
raises,
for
all
practical
purposes,
all
the
types
of
problems
that
would
come
up
in
case
any
women
came
in.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes,
your
honor.
but
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
but
they
are
subrogated
to
the
rights
of
those
women,
and
those
women--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes,
your
honor,
but
those
women
may
be
healthy
today,
but
not
tomorrow,
for
one
thing.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well,
i
think
it's
fully
within
the
doctrine
of
the
aptheker
case,
for
instance,
your
honor,
in
which
a
passport
was
denied
to
one
member
of
the
communist
party
and
the
question
–
the
court
considered
whether
–
how
that
statute
applied
to
other
members
of
the
communist
party.
i
think
that
the
issues
are
sufficiently
related
so
that
all
aspects
of
the
case
would
be
considered.
i
think
the
court
would
be
drawing
the
line
much
too
finely
if
it
attempted
to
separate
the
different
types
of
patients
that
might
come
into
that
center.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes,
your
honor.
the
fact
that
i
have
not
discussed
the
privacy
argument
or
the
first
amendment
argument
i
hope
will
not
be
construed
that
i
do
not
emphasize
them.
i
do.
the
first
amendment
argument
is
significant
in
two
respects;
both
in
the
fact
that
the
statute
is
void
on
its
lace
because
it
permits
counseling
–
aiding,
assisting,
abetting
and
counseling
the
use
of
contraceptive
devices.
that
term
could
mean
that
a
mother
who
counseled
her
newly
married
daughter
to
use
contraceptives
because
of
her
ill
health
could
come
under
the
statute.
it
could
apply
to
a
doctor
who
had
a
patient
in
his
office
and
discussed
the
effectiveness
of
a
contraceptive
device
with
her.
he
would
be
running
a
serious
risk.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well,
i'm
not
so
sure
about
that,
your
honor
and
mr.
justice
stewart
said
in
the
kingsley
pictures
case
that
freedom
of
speech
did
include
the
right
to
advocate
adultery.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
i
would
think
that
advocacy
would
be
more
likely
to
be
outside
the
first
amendment
than
counseling,
which
is
a
personal,
face-to-face
relationship,
and
would
probably
be
of
less
public
social
significance
than
advocacy,
but
we
would
argue
two
things,
your
honor
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
that's
true,
your
honor.
but
the
question
of
whether
a
person
had
violated
the
aiding
and
abetting
statute
by
counseling
various
people
on
the
use
of
contraceptives
would
raise
many
borderline
cases,
so
that
a
person
would
not
know
what
his
rights
were.
and
also,
we
would
contend
that
it
would
violate
the
first
amendment
substantively
because
we
would
contend
that
a
doctor
did
have
a
right
to
advise
people
to
use
contraceptives
and
to
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
the
aiding
and
abetting
statutes
grew
up
quite
independently
of
the
first
amendment
and
have
never
really
been
reconciled.
the
fact
that
there
have
not
been
more
cases
indicates
that
it's
not
been
too
pressing
a
situation,
but
i
think
sooner
or
later
there
will
have
to
be
a
reconciliation.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
not
perhaps
as
to
all
crimes
and
in
all
circumstances,
but
there
is
a
point
at
which
advising,
in
the
sense
of
advocating,
is
certainly
protected,
under
any
doctrine
of
this
court.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
mr.
justice
brandeis
you
recall
said,
that
there
are
some
types
of
advocacy
which,
even
under
the
clear
and
present
danger
test,
would
be
permitted
under
the
first
amendment.
it
depends
on
the,
in
his
view,
on
the
extent
of
the
evil,
and
hence
it
would
depend
on
how
serious
the
court
thought
the
consequences
were
under
that
view.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
we're
not,
directly,
your
honor,
and
it's
quite
true,
as
i
said
yesterday,
that
those
aspects
of
it
are
outside.
our
position
is
that
the
statute
is
void
on
its
face
because
it
infringes
the
first
amendment
by
permitting
the
possibility
of
a
punishment
for
counseling,
and
thus
inhibiting
free
speech;
and
also,
that
those
aspects
of
free
speech
which
were
protected
by
the
first
amendment
in
this
case
were
lumped
together
in
the
findings
of
the
court.
the
action
and
the
speech
were
all
put
together
in
one
gray-bag
and
the
court
came
out
with
its
conviction,
and
we
consider
that
also
a
violation
of
free
speech.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
i
think
it
would
not
cover
the
abortion
laws
or
the
sterilization
laws,
your
honor.
those
–
that
conduct
does
not
occur
in
the
privacy
of
the
home.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well,
that
aspect
of
it
is
true,
your
honor,
but
those
are
offenses
which
do
not
involve
the
type
of
enforcement
apparatus
as
to
what
goes
on
in
the
home
that
this
--
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
part
of
it
does,
your
honor,
but
the
conduct
that
is
being
prohibited
in
the
abortion
cases
takes
place
outside
of
the
home,
normally.
there
is
no
violation
of
the
sanctity
of
the
home.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
oh,
yes,
of
course.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
oh,
yes.
of
course,
the
substantive
offense
is
quite
different
here.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
well
i
don't
know
whether
you
need
characterize
it
that
way,
but
it
involves
taking
what
has
begun
to
be
a
life.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
yes,
your
honor,
but
that
case
is
different
from
this
situation
because
in
the
abortion
cases
connecticut
does
not
apply
this
moral
principle.
it
is
the
use
of
an
instrument
to
prevent
birth
taking
place,
but
they
do
not
apply
the
moral
principle
that
it
can
never
be
done.
in
connecticut,
abortion
is
allowed
where
it
is
necessary
to
save
the
life
of
the
mother
or
the
child.
so
that
the
basic
moral
principle
that
connecticut
is
trying
to
enforce
here,
they
simply
pay
no
attention
to
in
their
abortion
laws.
it's
a
completely
inconsistent
application
of
the
principle.
they
don't
take
it
seriously
in
the
abortion
cases,
only
in
contraception
cases.
mr.
thomas
i.
emerson
no,
your
honor.
in
the
demurrers
to
the
indictment
–
we
have
all
this
in
our
brief
on
page
16,
in
the
demurrers
to
the
indictment,
it
was
alleged
that
the
statutes
were
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
defendants,
and
it's
on
that
basis
that
they
make
that
assertion.
it
was
put
in
that
language
in
order
to
avoid
the
problem
of
the
tileston
case.
but
the
appellants
have
consistently
asserted
that
the
statutes
were
void
as
a
whole,
for
all
the
reasons
that
we
have
given
here,
and
we
