are
you
coming
back
to
your
first
amendment
argument,
if
not,
i
wanted
to
ask
you
a
question.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
i'll
withdraw
the
question.
justice

j.

mr.
clark,
just
to
pinpoint
this
inquiry,
on
page
15
of
your
brief--i
don't
know
that
i
agree,
but
you
might
provide
an
answer
by
reading
what
your
court
said
in
state
versus
nelson.
it
doesn't
sound
like
a
very
lofty
attribution
to
many
people,
but
that's
the
reason
your
court
assigned.
page
l5,
state
versus
nelson;
if
you'll
look
at
the
next
to
the
last
paragraph.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
is
the
reason
your
state,
i
take
it,
assigned
that
morals
are
involved?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
is
the
moral
ground,
then,
upon
which
presumably
your
court
sustained
this
legislation
under
the
police
power?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
that's
the
ground
on
which
you
rely?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
how
do
you
meet
the
argument
which
many
decisions
of
this
court
have
mentioned,
that
legislation
must
be
carefully
tailored
to
meet
the
evil?
if
this
is
the
evil
which
your
state
is
trying
to
combat,
you
have
other
laws
to
deal
with
that,
the
adultery
laws,
for
example.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
subsequent
to
poe
and
ullman,
was
there
any
further
legislative
action
or
attempted
legislative
action
on
the
statute?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
doesn't
that
assume
the
underlying
invalidity
of
the
statute,
because
the
mother
could
not
counsel
her
daughter
to
commit
adultery?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
emerson,
i
think
that
that's
quite
a
different
thing.
you
can
advocate,
as
a
matter
of
advocacy,
repeal
of
any
law,
and
say
you're
against
the
underlying
principle,
but
it's
pretty
farfetched
to
say
that,
assuming
the
validity
of
the
law,
the
first
amendment
protects
counseling
the
violation
of
such
a
law.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
of
course,
here,
as
a
matter
of
the
record,
the
activity
involved
is
not
counseling;
it's
conduct.
isn't
that
correct?
we're
dealing
here
with
conduct.
the
doctor
prescribed
devices
from
the
center,
and
mrs.
griswold
helped
supply
them.
so
we're
really
not
dealing
with
counseling.
