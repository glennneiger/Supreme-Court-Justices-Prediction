mr.
justice
bernnan
i
suppose
you're
not
making
any
equal
protection
argument.
that
reminds
me,
is
or
is
not
the
sale
of
contraceptives
a
crime
in
connecticut?
mr.
justice
bernnan
that
is
--
would
it
be,
for
example,
also
the
crime
of
aiding
or
abetting
and
violation
of
the
use
statute
to
sell
contraceptives?
mr.
justice
bernnan
have
there
been
any
prosecutions
for
that?
mr.
justice
bernnan
just
one
other
question,
i
am
not
satisfied
if
i
may.
there's
no
authorization
for
the
prescription
of
contraceptives
to
prevent
disease
or
that
sort
of
thing?
mr.
justice
bernnan
well,
is
that
the
way
that
contraceptives
are
freely
sold
in
connecticut?
mr.
justice
bernnan
and
yet,
you're
making
no
equal
protection
argument
at
all?
mr.
justice
bernnan
i'm
sorry.
i
gather,
looking
at
your
brief
at
page
nine,
that
this
exclusion
of
sales
for
the
prevention
of
disease
is
read
into
the
fact
that
the
statute
deals
only
with
use
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
conception,
is
that
it?
mr.
justice
bernnan
i
mean,
has
there
been
any
court
decision
to
--
mr.
justice
bernnan
well,
on
the
strength
of
that,
wouldn't
you
have
had
a
rather
compelling
equal
protection
argument,
if
the
connecticut
courts
went
that
far?
mr.
justice
bernnan
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
why
you
haven't
made
an
equal
protection
argument
which
on
the
face
of
it,
it
seems
to
me,
might
have
considerable
merit?
mr.
justice
bernnan
it
just
struck
me
that,
if
it
has
merit
on
narrower
constitutional
grounds,
it
would
dispose
of
the
statute,
which
is
what
you
want
to
do?
mr.
justice
bernnan
well,
let's
see.
wasn't
aptheker
underpinned
on
the
concept
of
over
broadness
which
went
too
far?
mr.
justice
bernnan
that's
due
process
--
mr.
justice
bernnan
in
other
words,
that
this
–
however
constitutionally
a
state
may
enact
a
statute
on
this
subject
to
go
so
far
as
to
reach
married
couples
goes
too
far,
and
in
that
sense
the
statute
is
over
broad,
is
that
it?
mr.
justice
bernnan
now,
you're
going
to
come
and
tell
us
why
it
is
that
it's
over
broad
as
to
married
couples?
mr.
justice
bernnan
[inaudible]
do
the
statutes
fall?
mr.
justice
bernnan
what
about
the
federal
one?
mr.
justice
bernnan
what
cases
say
that?
mr.
justice
bernnan
is
that
in
this
court?
mr.
justice
bernnan
nothing
in
this
court,
is
there?
mr.
justice
bernnan
well,
i
wonder,
professor
emerson,
if
this
goes
off
–
you
were
to
prevail
on
an
aptheker
or
over
breadth
ground,
why
would
that
settle
anything,
except
that
this
connecticut
statute
is
over
broad?
why
would
that
settle
necessarily
the
constitutionality
of
the
massachusetts
statute?
mr.
justice
bernnan
you
also
can
make
the
first
amendment
argument
based
on
advice,
can't
you?
mr.
justice
bernnan
but
if
in
fact
these
devices
are
provided
for
the
prevention
or
treatment
of
disease,
that's
no
crime?
mr.
justice
bernnan
but
what
about
connecticut?
mr.
justice
bernnan
well,
i
understood,
from
what
professor
emerson
said,
that,
while
it
was
not
directly
decided,
there
were
indications
in
some
connecticut
court
opinions
that
this
statute
would
not
reach
that
situation?
mr.
justice
bernnan
do
you
know
if
the
police
have
ever
done
anything
about
it?
mr.
justice
bernnan
drugstore
selling?
mr.
justice
bernnan
have
there
been
any
prosecutions
of
doctors
who
prescribe?
mr.
justice
bernnan
well,
does
this
mean
that--is
it
the
state's
position
that
a
sale
or
advice
represented
to
be
to
prevent
disease
would
be
a
violation
of
this
statute?
mr.
justice
bernnan
well,
would
it
or
wouldn't?
mr.
justice
bernnan
it
would
not
be
--
mr.
justice
bernnan
is
this
matter
pending
in
the
present
session
of
the
legislature?
mr.
justice
bernnan
when
does
the
session
end?
mr.
justice
bernnan
when
in
june?
mr.
justice
bernnan
either
house
taken
any
action
on
this?
mr.
justice
bernnan
you're
suggesting
additional
legislation,
leaving
this
statute
on
the
books,
is
that
it?
mr.
justice
bernnan
you
could
buy
that,
couldn't
you?
mr.
justice
bernnan
on
the
basis
of
your
argument,
i
don't
see
why
not.
mr.
justice
bernnan
no,
but
the
reason
you
give
us
which
would
support
the
power
of
the
state
to
do
this,
it
seems
to
me,
would
equally
apply
to
an
amendment
of
the
statute
which
bars
the
use
of
the
rhythm
method,
makes
it
a
crime
to
use
it.
why
wouldn't
it?
mr.
justice
bernnan
sure.
mr.
justice
bernnan
don't
you
have
an
abatement
statute
in
connecticut?
mr.
justice
bernnan
you
say
it
wouldn't
solve
the
problem
of
these
two.
don't
you
have
an
abatement
statute
in
connecticut?
mr.
justice
bernnan
what
about
bell
against
maryland?
mr.
justice
bernnan
what
about
bell
and
maryland
last
year?
mr.
justice
bernnan
well,
apart
from
that,
mr.
emerson,
i
take
it
abortion
involves
killing
a
life
in
being,
doesn't
it?
isn't
that
a
rather
different
problem
from
contraception?
mr.
justice
bernnan
and
isn't
it
different
in
the
sense
of
the
state's
power
to
deal
with
it?
