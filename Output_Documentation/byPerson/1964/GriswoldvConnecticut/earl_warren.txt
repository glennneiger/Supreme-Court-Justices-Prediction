number
496,
estelle
t.
griswold,
et
al.,
versus
connecticut.
mr.
emerson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
make
any
constitutional
distinction
between
the
doctor
and
the
director
of
the
institution,
so
far
as
their
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
claim
that,
because
he
is
a
doctor
he
has
a
peculiar
right
over
and
above
another
individual
to
give
this
information?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
so
that
if
mrs.
griswold
had
no
doctors,
she
could
have
done
the
same
thing,
conducted
the
kind
of
a
clinic?
chief
justice
earl
warren
openly
and
validly
they're
on
sale,
not
secretly?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
not
done
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
the
extent
of
the
birth
rate
in
connecticut
vis-a-vis
the
states
that
don't
have
such
laws?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
emerson,
do
i
understand
you
that,
if
a
couple
goes
to
a
doctor
and
gets
this
information,
that
they've
violated
no
law,
but
if
they
go
to
a
clinic
they
have?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
never
been
enforced
against
anyone,
has
it,
until
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
any
judgment
resolved?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
the
one
that
was
nolle
prosequi
when
it
came
back?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
wasn't
closed
down
when
they
charged
them,
and
it
wasn't
closed
down
when
they
got
the
final
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut,
was
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
how
can
we
say
that
this
law
is
interpreted
by
your
courts
not
to
apply
to
doctors
who
do
the
same
things
that
this
clinic
does?
where
in
your
law
or
in
your
decisions
can
we
find
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
what
i
understood,
but
also
i
understood
you
to
say
that
a
person
with
means
could
go
to
a
doctor
and
get
this
information
because
he
has
the
money
to
pay
for
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
a
poor
person
could
not
do
it.
now,
what
do
you
base
that
distinction
on?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
state
concede
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
must
have
had
some
experience
with
it
up
to
this
time,
what
have
they
said
about
that
as
it's
gone
through
the
courts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well
we
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
wouldn't
it,
if
it
relates
to
morality?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
money
welfare?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may,
mr.
emerson.
mr.
clark?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
that
we
have
a
record
of
what
device
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you're
saying
that
those
devices
which
are
described
specifically
have
nothing
to
do
with
devices
that
are
sold
or
described
for
the
prevention
of
disease?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
clark,
as
i
recall
it,
when
the
attorney
general
was
here
in
the
poe
case,
he
disavowed
any
knowledge
of
any
enforcement
of
this
statute
from
the
standpoint
of
devices
for
prevention
of
disease.
now,
do
you
have
information
to
the
contrary?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
the
poe
case
was
here,
the
attorney
general
of
connecticut,
as
i
recall
it,
said
that
he
had
no
knowledge
of
any
enforcement
of
this
statute
so
far
as
the
selling
of
apparatus
for
the
prevention
of
disease,
and
he
admitted
there
practically
that
they
were
sold
in
all
the
drugstores
in
the
state.
that's
my
recollection;
i
may
be
wrong.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
why
do
you
say
to
us
here
that
there
is
enforcement
of
it
and
there
have
been
prosecutions
here
and
there
and
so
forth,
if
the
condition
is
the
same?
chief
justice
earl
warren
"all
the
way,"
what
do
you
mean?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
we
will
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
496,
estelle
t.
griswold,
et
al.,
appellants
versus
connecticut.
mr.
clark,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
difference
between
this
and
the
case
of
the
numbers
racket
is
that
in
the
latter
case
you
have
had
many
prosecutions
over
the
lifetime
of
this
particular
act,
haven't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
you
can
hardly
cite
any
at
all
in
this,
in
violation
of
this
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
little
different.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
couldn't
quire
hear
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
that
case
go
to
your
supreme
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
see.
that's
one
of
them
which
is
referred
to
in
your
supreme
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
emerson?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
repeatedly
say
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
private
physicians.
now,
where
in
your
record
do
you
find
that
fact?
i
understand
counsel
to
say
that
it
does
apply
to
them,
just
as
well
as
anybody
else.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
much
has
it
been
enforced
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we
can
assume
as
a
matter
of
law
that
this
is
applied
only
to
clinics
and
is
not
applied
to
doctors?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
record
support
that,
or
is
that
your
argument?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
are
we
dealing
on
the
record
of
poe
against
ullman
here
and
not
this
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we
didn't
vouch
for
the
record,
the
truthfulness
of
the
record,
we
were
dealing
with
the
record
we
had,
which
was
inadequate,
in
poe
and
i'm
just
wondering
if
we
haven't
got
the
same
thing
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
you
to
say
yesterday,
mr.
emerson,
that
you
made
no
distinction
between
the
doctor
in
this
case
and
the
director.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
emerson,
i
understood
mr.
clark
to
say
that
the
question
of
the
unconstitutionality
of
this
act
on
its
face
was
never
raised
below,
and
that
this
was
the
first
time
you
argue
it.
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
point
out
there
that
"as
applied."
now,
did
you
specifically
attack
the
constitutionality
on
its
face,
as
being
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
the
record
where
we
can
find
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
we
have
the
citation
from
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
very
well.
