justice

is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
emerson
are
these
devices
on
sale
in
drugstores?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
was
more
than
advice
here,
wasn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
furnishing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
going
to
cover
in
your
argument
why
these
defendants
can
or
should
assert
the
rights
of
the
married
people
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
you
are
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
least
it's
not
–
i
gather
from
the
talk
about
equal
protection
before,
that
the
issue
is
not
in
the
record,
it
was
not
developed
in
the
record,
and
that
the
equal
protection
argument
is
not
made?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
record
doesn't
show
whether
or
not
the
state
enforces
it
against
private
doctors?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
only
for
a
forbidden
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
know
as
a
matter
of
fact
whether
sales
take
place,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
they're
illegal
sales?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
selling?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
doctors?
what
about
doctors
prescribing
these
devices?
are
there
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
theory
on
that
is
it's
because
they're
prescribing
for
the
prevention
of
disease
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
connecticut
permits
sale
by
drugstores,
or
connecticut
permits
prescription
by
a
doctor,
it
isn't
because
of
the
prevention
of
disease?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
standing
problem
involved?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
but
any
ground
on
which
the
constitutionality
of
the
basic
statute
could
be
attacked,
that
ground
is
available
to
these
aiders
and
abetters?
justice
byron
r.
white
including
the
privacy
--
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
nothing
more
than
asking
whether
an
aider
and
abetter
can
attack
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute,
that's
the
only
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
can
an
aider
and
abetter
attack
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
which
makes
it
crime
out
of
the
act
he's
supposed
to
be
aiding
and
abetting?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
that
the
grounds
on
which
the
statutes
are
attacked
here
weren't
raised
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
isn't
a
standing
problem.
it
is
that
the
arguments
weren't
raised
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
weren't
they
passed
upon
by
your
supreme
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
fourteenth
amendment
covers
quite
a
bit
of
territory?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
say
the
constitutional
issue
is
here
to
be
decided
in
this
court
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
liberty
and
property
of--
justice
byron
r.
white
--of
themselves
as
doctors
or
advisers?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
emerson,
could
i
ask
you
another
question?
apparently,
the
state
would
concede
that
you
certainly
–
that
the
defendants
can
raise
the
constitutional
issues
about
this
statute
which
the
married
couple
could
raise,
provided
they
were
litigating
in
a
court
of
law
and
things
like
that,
but
how
about
the
health
argument?
here
were
two
healthy,
two
healthy
people,
apparently,
these
two
married
women
who
testified
and
can
we
really
be
legitimately
concerned
with
the
way
this
statute
might
apply
to
two
other
married
women
who
might
have
health
reasons
for
wanting
a
birth
control
device?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
these
people
are
being
prosecuted
for
giving
advice
and
furnishing
devices
to
these
particular
women
who
testified,
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
in
a
lot
of
other
situations?
justice
byron
r.
white
only
those
women,
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
the
woman
was
prosecuted
for
using,
and
she
says,
"this
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
it
would
prevent
a
sick
woman
from
using
it;"
and,
are
you
sick?
"no,
i'm
not
sick
at
all;
i
just
want
to
practice
birth
control."
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
how
about
your
first
amendment
argument
in
the
–
is
that
really
seriously
involved
here
because
it
was
furnishing
the
device?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
a
specific
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
is
an
aiding
and
abetting
statute
in
connection
with
a
specific
crime.
this
is
not
a
statute
that
says,
"it
shall
be
illegal
to
aid,
to
counsel
about
birth
control."
this
is
an
aiding
and
abetting
provision
of
a
specific
crime.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
this
basis,
there
would
be
an
awful
lot
of
aiding
and
abetting
statutes
that
would
be
declared
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
take
your
argument
seriously,
you
have
to
assume
that
the
aiding
and
abetting
statutes
really,
really
would
be
applied
to
people
who
simply
counseled
generally,
rather
than
in
connection
with
a
specific
crime.
either
that,
or
we
have
to
think
that
you
are
urging
that
advising
to
commit
a
specific
crime
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
you're
not
doing
the
latter,
are
you?
