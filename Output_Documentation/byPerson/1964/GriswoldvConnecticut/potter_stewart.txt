justice
potter
stewart
what
you
said
would
be
correct
if
contraceptives
were
sold
as
contraceptives,
but
i
suppose,
if
they
were
sold
as
something
else,
such
as
preventives
for
disease,
that
would
not
violate
the
abetting
statute,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
emerson,
maybe
i'm
misreading
your
opponent's
brief,
but
if
i
don't,
there
seems
to
be
a
little
difference
of
opinion
between
you
as
to
what
you've
just
told
us.
i'm
referring
to
page
nine
of
his
brief,
in
which
he
tells
us
that
some
thirty
states
have
laws
on
this
general
subject,
laws
of
one
kind
or
another,
and,
of
those
thirty,
the
laws
of
massachusetts,
minnesota,
mississippi,
missouri,
nebraska
and
new
york
would
be
violated
by
the
facts
in
the
present
case.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
telling
us
that
they're
dead
letters
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
they're
not,
as
a
matter
of
administration
of
law,
that
they're
not
enforced,
but
that's
–
that
was
--
you're
kind
of
reaching
the
basis
on
which
this
court
disposed
of
poe
against
ulmin,
which
i
suppose
didn't
please
you
very
much,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
federal,
the
federal
statutes,
18
united
states
code
1461
and
1462?
justice
potter
stewart
having
to
do
with
the
mailing
of
them?
justice
potter
stewart
how
have
the
federal
statutes
been
interpreted,
did
you
say?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
back
in
1936?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
have
any
data
as
to
the
breadth
of
the
use
of
these
devices
back
in
the
late
18th
century
when
the
ninth
amendment
was
adopted?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
we
can
–
it
is
true
that
there's
been
a
good
deal
of
technological
development
in
this
area
in
recent
years,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now
that
i've
interrupted
you,
you've
told
us
that
in
connecticut
the
sale
of
these
devices
is
not
molested
because
they're
sold
for
the
prevention
of
disease.
is
this
true
about
all
of
these
devices
that
are
covered,
that
each
of
them
has
the
potential
dual
function
of
acting
in
a
contraceptive
capacity
and
as
a
prevention
of
disease,
or
only
with
respect
to
some
of
them?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
clark,
what
you're
touching
on
now
leads
me
to
ask,
what
is
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
in
connecticut?
your
basic
argument
in
your
brief,
and
so
far
in
your
oral
argument,
is
that
this
is
well
within
the
so-called
police
power
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
what
is
its
purpose?
justice
potter
stewart
to
increase
the
population
of
connecticut,
or
to
impair
its
decrease,
or
is
it,
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
is
it?
what
is
the
purpose
of
this
legislation?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
trouble
with
that
argument
is
that,
on
this
record,
this
involves
only
married
women.
justice
potter
stewart
so
how
can
you
make
that
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
for
what
purpose?
justice
potter
stewart
for
what
purpose
under
its
police
power,
assuming
we're
dealing
now
with
married
couples?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
argument
are
you
happy
with?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
do
you
think
the
state
of
connecticut
could
prevent
marriage?
justice
potter
stewart
but
surely
you'll
agree
with
me,
they
couldn't
–
l
should
think
you'd
agree
with
me,
that
if
the
state
of
connecticut
should
say,
there
will
be
no
marriages
contracted
in
this
state,
there
will
be
no
sexual
intercourse
of
any
kind,
married
or
unmarried.
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
what
purpose,
what
is
the
police
power
purpose
of
connecticut
in
telling
married
people,
two
people
who
are
married
to
each
other,
that
they
cannot
use
contraceptives?
justice
potter
stewart
what
kind
of
morality?
what
moral
purpose
is
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
would
have
had
quite
a
different
case
if
the
state
of
connecticut
compelled
all
married
couples
to
use
them.
that's
not
–
that's
when
you'd
run
into
the
argument
you're
now
making,
that
this
violates
the
religious
precepts
and
beliefs
of
certain
groups.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
and
i
had
agreed
that
this
isn't
involved
here.
we're
dealing
here,
by
definition
and
on
this
record,
with
advice
and
the
furnishing
of
devices
to
married
women
who
asked
for
such
advice.
justice
potter
stewart
anybody
who
has
the
price
of
a
ticket
to
new
york
is
immune?
justice
potter
stewart
but
as
justice
goldberg
said,
you
do
have
substantive
criminal
statutes
against
adultery
or
against
extramarital
fornication,
or
non-marital
fornication,
in
connecticut,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you're
suggesting,
as
a
matter
of
practical
problems
of
proof,
it's
easier
to
prove
that
in
such
relationship
people
use
contraceptives
than
it
is
to
prove
that
they
had
such
a
relationship?
justice
potter
stewart
that
rather
begs
the
question,
doesn't
it,
you've
got
to
–
i
suppose
a
person
can't
be
convicted
of
aiding
and
abetting
a
criminal
offense
if
that
substantive
criminal
offense
is
unconstitutional,
if
it's
beyond
the
constitutional
power
of
a
state
to
enact
it.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
do
come
back
to
the
substantive
statute,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
same
token,
i
suppose
you
can't,
under
the
first
amendment,
free
speech
doesn't
entitle
you
to
aid
and
abet
something
which
is
a
criminal
offense.
so
you
i
think
that,
on
either
side
of
this
argument,
you
come
back
to
the
substantive
use
of
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
you're
saying
would
be
relevant,
and
perhaps
with
some
persuasiveness,
if
what
connecticut
had
done
were
to
compel
everybody
to
use
contraceptives.
then
you
could
show
that
there's
divided
opinion
about
their
value
for
certain
people
with
certain
physical
conditions,
but
we
have
the
other
side
of
the
coin
here,
and
if
the
medical
and
sociological
and
religious
views
on
this
subject
are
divided
and
it
adds
up
on
net
balance
to
be
relatively
neutral,
then
what
we
have
here
is
the
freedom
of
people,
of
married
couples
to
do
this
just
as
they
want
to
and
therefore,
i
don't
quite
see
the
relevance
of
what
you're
telling
us
now,
when
you
remember
what
this
case
is
about.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
still
conies
back
to
what
the
basic
purpose,
under
the
police
power
of
your
state,
is.
now
could
connecticut
decree
that
married
people
live
separately
in
dormitories
for
men
and
for
women,
except
for
two
weeks
out
of
the
year,
under
the
due
process
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
a
big
difference,
though,
isn't
there
or
isn't
there?
that
case
which
you
just
cited
had
to
do
with
economic
regulation,
the
regulation
of
business,
economic
policy;
no,
not
–
there
was
no
impingement
on
the
kind
of
personal
privacy
and
freedom
involved
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
now
you
and
i
agreed
earlier,
i
think
–
to
come
hack
to
the
substantive
use
statute,
or
how
you
start
in
this
case--
justice
potter
stewart
that
statute
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
to
that
statute
that
i
was
adverting,
and
i
was
indicating
by
my
question
that
there
might
be
a
difference
between
a
state's
economic
regulation
of
commercial
businesses
in
that
state
and
this
kind
of
a
statute,
which
affects
–
whether
or
not
it
does
so
with
constitutional
validity
is
the
question
before
us,
but
which
certainly
affects
the
individual
privacy
and
freedom
of
human
beings,
and
not
in
their
commercial
activities,
but
in
those
private
activities
of
their
lives?
justice
potter
stewart
or
by
not
getting
married.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
emerson
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
emerson,
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
your
argument,
but
before
you
sit
down,
i'd
like
to
know
what
you
do,
if
anything,
about
the
precedents
in
this
court,
first
margaret
sanger
against
the
people
of
new
york
in
251
u.s.,
and
second,
gardner
against
massachusetts
in
305
u.s.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
an
equal
protection
case,
was
it?
i
notice
it
was
argued
to
the
court
in
the
sanger
case.
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
her
claim
in
that
case?
justice
potter
stewart
because
it
denied
her
equal
protection,
or
why?
because
it
allowed
physicians
to
do
it
and
not
laymen?
justice
potter
stewart
well
what
was
her
claim,
do
you
remember?
i
don't
know.
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
wondered
what
your
thought
was
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
gardner
case?
justice
potter
stewart
not
to
counsel
an
individual
person
to
commit
it,
there
may
be
a
difference.
