mr.
joseph
b.
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
actually,
the
issue
that
this
court
is
being
asked
to
decide
is
not
a
new
issue
here.
it's,
should
the
case
of
state
versus
sanger
from
new
york,
and
should
the
case
of
state
versus
gardner
from
massachusetts,
decisions
of
this
court,
be
overturned?
in
both
those
cases,
this
court
was
involved
with
a
situation
where
clinics
were
being
run
in
which
contraceptives
were
being
supplied
to
people
to
be
used
as
contraceptives,
the
same
factual
situation
we
have
here.
and
in
both
cases,
this
court
held
that
this
was
not
a
federal
question,
this
was
a
question
solely
within
the
responsibility
of
the
state
legislatures,
and
it
was
not
a
question
to
be
entertained
by
this
court.
now
--
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
they
involved
sales,
if
your
honor
please,
but
the
connecticut
court,
in
the
tilestone
case
has
interpreted
the
connecticut
statutes,
this
particular
statute,
the
interplay
of
these
two
statutes,
as
applying
to
both
the
user
and
the
provider
of
the
material.
and
it's
conceded
by
all,
and
i
think
it
was
conceded
by
mr.
emerson
here
today,
that
the
statutes
in
their
breadth,
with
the
accessory
statute,
apply
to
the
situation
of
sale
or
providing
or
disseminating,
or
however
you
want
to
call
it
--
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
but,
if
your
honor
please,
there's
no
other
purpose
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
now,
this
is
an
interesting
thing,
if
your
honor
please,
because
we
have
the
case
in
massachusetts
where
this
argument
was
made.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
connecticut
has
no
case
at
all
on
the
subject.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
well,
there
may
be.
i
can't
recall
them
at
this
time,
if
your
honor
please.
i
might
say
this,
that
it
has
been
held,
both
in
the
brief
and
here
today,
that
there
have
been
no
convictions
under
connecticut
law.
well,
to
that
i
might
say
that,
of
course,
the
supreme
court
of
errors
of
connecticut
only
handles
appeals.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
well,
i
am
told
that
sales
take
place,
if
your
honor
please.
it's
on
an
under-the-counter
basis.
it's
the
same
as
the
sales
of
numbers
take
place.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
they're
illegal
sales,
the
same
as
a
bookie
selling
a
horserace.
it's
against
the
law;
it's
illegal.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
there
have
been
convictions.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
there
have
been
convictions,
if
your
honor
please,
yes.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
yes.
now,
the
thing
is,
of
course,
there
are
no
recorded
cases
on
this
prior
to
1961,
and
the
reason
for
this
is
that,
prior
to
1961,
the
minor
court
system
of
connecticut
consisted
of
courts
in
several
towns.
you
had
a
j.p.
system
in
some
places,
you
had
municipal
courts
of
varying
degrees.
but
with
the
circuit
court
system,
all
the
minor
courts,
the
minor
criminal
things,
misdemeanors,
certain
felonies,
came
into
being
into
one
place
and
from
now
on,
from
1961
on,
there's
at
least
a
possibility
of
more
records
being
kept.
now
--
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
there
are
no
cases
of
any
doctors
prescribing,
either.
the
only
cases
that
have
ever--
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
i
have
never
heard
of
any
prosecution
of
a
doctor
who
prescribed
it,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
if
your
honor
please,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
argument
is
completely
irrelevant,
that
they
are
not
in
fact
prescribing
for
the
prevention
of
disease.
the
prevention
of
disease
is
a
completely
irrelevant
argument,
in
that
only
certain
of
these
devices
could
be
used
for
to
prevention
diseases.
these
devices
are
not
in
this
particular
case,
but
only
certain
devices
could
be
used
to
prevent
disease.
now,
who
could
use
the
devices?
since
connecticut
has
laws
against
fornication
and
adultery,
only
married
people
could
use
these
devices.
in
order
to
get
married,
you
have
to
have
a
certificate
that
you
are
free
from
venereal
disease;
therefore,
you
couldn't
have
the
disease
beforehand.
the
devices
can
only
be
used
against
venereal
disease.
this
argument
of
using
devices
to
prevent
disease
seems
to
me
a
ludicrous
argument.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
connecticut
does
not
in
fact
permit.
that
is
the
point.
we
cite
in
our
brief,
–
the
other
side
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
letter
to
the
late
professor
fowler
harper,
who
had
represented
the
appellants
in
their
case,
to
the
effect
that
–
excuse
me,
it
was
from
the
state
consumer
protection
division
now;
pure
food
and
drug,
i
think,
was
the
title
then,
concerning
sales,
supplying
certain
devices
that
might
have
been
used
they
claim,
and
they
pointed
this
out.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
pointed
this
out
in
the
poe
case.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
if
your
honor
please,
if
it
could
be
honestly--
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
i
don't
think
it
would.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
i
don't
think
it
would
be,
if
in
fact
it
happened,
but
i
just
can't
see
that
it
could
happen,
because
i
don't
see
that
position.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
if
your
honor
please,
a
device
that
could
be
used
for
prevention
of
disease
--
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
they
are
listed
in
the
findings
as
exhibits.
i
think
that
is
the
only
place
it
can
be
round
in
the
record,
the
particular
things
that
were
given
to
the
particular
married
women
involved
in
the
case.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
yes.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
that
is
exactly
my
point.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
that
is
exactly
my
point.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
did
not
get
your
question.
i
am
very
sorry.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
i
think
that
is
undoubtedly
the
fact,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
they're
sold
under
the
counters
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
i
say,
if
your
honor
please,
that
there
is
enforcement
of
it;
that
if
there
are
sales
they
are
surreptitious
sales;
that
there
is
enforcement,
in
that
there
have
been
criminal
convictions
of
the
statute
itself.
now,
perhaps
my
brother
wasn't
able
to
find
them.
maybe
i,
in
the
position
of
being
a
prosecutor,
was
able
to
find
a
little
better,
but
i
did
discover
and
i
wrote
to
the
man
who
categorizes
all
offenses,
now
that
we
have
a
statewide
system
in
and
i
find
that
there
was,
in
1961
and
in
1962,
a
conviction,
a
case
that
went
through
all
the
way
on
the
merits.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
a
guilty
finding.
no
appeal;
the
final
disposition.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
charges
on
the
merits.
now,
i
was
not
able
to
find
out
the
name
of
the
case
or
anything
else,
because
it's
just
a
statistical
basis.
i
could
probably
find
out,
but
there
is
at
least
one
case
one
year
and
one
case
the
next,
where
somebody
was
convicted
of
violating
this
statute.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
in
yesterday's
questioning
there
were
some
questions
directed
both
to
me
and
to
mr.
emerson
concerning
population
and
birth
rates.
in
our
brief
at
pages
27
and
28,
we
cite
the
statistics
that
show
that
the
birth
rate
in
the
state
of
connecticut
last
year,
for
the
seventh
straight
year,
was
on
the
decline.
the
birth
rate
in
the
united
states
is
apparently
also
on
the
decline,
and
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
reporter
magazine
of
march
25th,
1965,
there
is
an
article
entitled
"our
population.
the
statistics
explosion,"
written
in
part
by
richard
m.
scammony,
who
was
the
head
the
census
bureau,
that
points
out
that
the
growth
rate
or
the
birth
rate
in
this
country
is
actually
on
the
decline,
and
takes
great
issue
with
the
so
called
experts,
using
his
term,
of
a
population
explosion.
the
tenor
of
his
article
is
that
this
so-called
fear
that
there
will
be
no
breathing
room
is
actually
a
false
use
of
statistics,
that
in
fact
if
you
use
the
same
logic
that
people
of
this
ilk
have
been
using
in
the
past,
the
statistics
would
show
–
that
is,
carrying
out
the
same
logic,
that
there
won't
be
anyone
in
this
country
by
the
year
2000.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
it's
purpose
is
to
--
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
if
your
honor
please,
i
do
not
hold
that
it
is
to
increase
the
population
of
connecticut.
i
don't
think
that
this
is
a
–
we
could
make
this
claim
valid.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
i
think
that
it's
to
reduce
the
chances
of
immorality.
if
your
honor
please,
and
i
use
the
word
"immorality"
here
in
a
broad
sense,
that
is,
in
one
way
to
act
as
a
deterrent
to
sexual
intercourse
outside
of
the
marital
relationship.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
that
on
this
record,
that
the
statute
is
a
valid
exercise
of
the
police
power
--
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
if
your
honor
please,
on
this
purpose
–
on
this
record,
that
there
is
a
distinction
and
there
has
to
be
a
distinction
between
birth
control
and
the
use
of
contraceptives.
that
is
to
say
that
all
contraceptives
involve
birth
control,
but
in
order
to
practice
so-called
birth
control
one
does
not
have
to
use
contraceptives,
and
that
the
state
is
able
to
take
this
position
and
make
this
distinction,
that
there
are
–
if
it
be
said,
well,
should
married
people
be
allowed
to
use
these
devices,
would
this
not
–
is
not
the
state
going
too
far?
i
think
the
state
can
answer
to
that
that
there
are
other
methods
available
to
married
people.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
well,
if
your
honor
please,
going
back,
connecticut
in
the
nelson
case
cited
the
byrne
case
in
new
york,
and
one
of
the
reasons
cited
by
the
connecticut
court,
and
the
byrne
case
was
that,
it
was
not
the
–
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
would
not
be
improper
for
the
legislature
to
consider
that
connecticut,
as
any
state,
has
the
right
to
look
out
for
its
own
continuation.
this
is
the
population
argument.
i
personally
am
not
too
happy
with
it,
but
--
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
i
think,
if
your
honor
please,
the
only
argument
we
can
honestly
say
is
that
this
is
a
question
of
pure
power.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
i
think
the
state
of
connecticut
could
prevent
marriage
in
certain
people,
certain
groups,
yes,
if
your
honor
please,
between
idiots,
say,
or
age
in
marriage.
i
think,
if
your
honor
please
that
--
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
i
think,
if
your
honor
please,
it's
just
to
preserve
morality.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
if
your
honor
please,
it
is
not
unheard
of
that
the
use
of
contraceptives
themselves
would
be
immoral
and
certainly,
this
is
a
view
that
has
been
prevalent
in
history
right
up
to
the
last
few
years
in
most
groups.
in
connecticut,
citing
the
brief
of
our
opponents
in
one
instance,
the
number
of
catholics
and
orthodox
jews
in
the
state,
if
you,
were
just
to
put
it
on
a
numerical
basis
--
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
this
is
true,
but
if
your
honor
please,
it
also
would
be
more
difficult
for
the
state
to
control
the
result
of
what
we
call
a
dissolute
action,
that
is,
fornication
and
adultery.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
what
we
have
here,
that
is
true.
we
have
here
a
center
being
used,
and
the
witnesses
that
the
state
used
in
this
case
were
in
fact
three
married
women.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
if
your
honor
please,
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at.
i
must
say
that
i
did
rather
poorly.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
that
is
correct.
if
your
honor
please,
the
court
held
in
nelson,
if,
meaning
the
legislature
was
not
precluded
from
considering
that
not
all
married
people
were
immune
from
temptations
or
inclinations
to
extramarital
indulgence
and
i
think,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
i
think
it
is,
sir.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
no,
if
your
honor
please,
that
is
not
the
case,
because
the
new
york
law
is
not
that
way.
the
new
york
law,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
contraceptives
cannot
be
sold,
except
for
the
treatment
of
disease.
now
certainly,
anyone
who
wants
to
use
something
as
a
contraceptive
is
not
using
something
for
the
treatment
of
disease
and
connecticut
is
like
many
other
states
in
this
regard.
we
have
cited
some
other
states
in
our
brief
that
hold
to
this
same
proposition,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
this
is
correct,
if
your
honor
please,
but
the
problem
is
that
if
contraceptives,
say,
are
freely
sold,
dispensed,
or
otherwise
used,
even
to
married
people,
how
can
it
be
known
that
they
will
be
used
within
the
marital
relationship?
not
all
people
are
immune
from
adultery.
the
problem
would
be
greater,
the
problem
of
identification,
the
problem
of
conviction,
would
be
greater
without
it.
i
don't
hold
that
the
statute
is
the
most
wise
way
of
putting
the
decision.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
no,
i
am
not
saying
that,
if
your
honor
please.
i
am
saying
that
with
the
two
statutes
here
involved
it's
easier
to
control
the
problem.
i'm
not
saying
it
would
be
that
much
easier
to
prove
it.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
that
is
somewhat
–
that
is
so,
but
our
court
has
held
in
tileston
that
the
statutes
as
here
in
this
case,
apply
both
to
the
provider
and
to
the
user.
now,
the
other
side
has
tried
to
push
this
right
on
the
use
all
the
time,
but
with
our
accessory
statute,
we
get
beyond
the
use
itself,
we
get
into
the
question
of
the
provider,
the
disseminator
of
devices.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
this
is
a
valid
argument,
i
think,
and
i
don't
think
that
this
statute
is
beyond
the
power
of
connecticut
to
enact.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
we
have
to
come
back
to
the
substantive
statute
that
this
is
a
valid
--
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
well,
there
is
a
standing
problem,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
not
in
relationship
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
but
there
is
a
great
standing
problem
here
in
the
relationship
of
these
defendants
claiming
it.
as
i
understand,
one
of
their
main
arguments
was
a
claim
of
privacy.
now,
it's
not
their
privacy,
because
they
were
running
a
center,
they
were
running
a
clinic.
they
were
holding
themselves
out
to
the
world
and
as
a
matter
of
–
it
can't,
think
it
truly
can't
be
said,
that
it's
the
privacy
of
the
so-called
patients
involved,
because
in
this
case
we
had
three
women
testify
against
them.
if
there
was
any
claim
that
anyone
had
a
right
to
privacy,
it
would
be
a
right
of
these
people.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
i
think
that
might
be
a
fair
statement,
but
i
might
point
out
--
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
including
privacy,
except
–
no,
i
would
have
to
disagree,
if
the
court
please,
and
i
would
have
to
say,
because
what
they
are
trying
to
do,
then,
is,
they
would
be
advocating
the
views
or
the
rights,
if
any
such
right
exists
of
people
who
in
fact
testified
for
the
state
against
them
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
and
think
this
would
be
an
extremely
bad
precedent,
if
defendants
could
claim
the
rights,
if
any
such
right
exists
of
a
witness
who
testifies
against
him.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
i'm
sorry,
i
--
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
i
think
he
can,
if
your
honor
please,
but
i
think
that
they
failed
to
do
it
in
this
case.
i
think
that
they
could
have
put
on
testimony;
they
did
not.
in
this
case,
two
detectives
and
three
women
testified
for
the
state.
the
defendants
testified,
and
they
had
some
doctors.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
that
is
correct,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
this
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
well,
the
supreme
court
said
that
the
arguments
of
the
defendants
didn't
merit
discussion.
now,
if
this
means
they
were
passed
upon,
they
were
passed
upon,
i
suppose,
if
you
please.
but
the
only
arguments
that
the
defendants,
the
appellants
made
in
this
case
was
a
first
amendment
argument,
freedom
of
speech,
which
i
understand
they
abandoned
here
yesterday.
it
was
action,
not
speech
and
a
broad
claim
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
they
argued
on
demurrer,
and
this
they
argued
through
the
case.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
liberty
and
property;
liberty
and
property
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
"their
rights
to
liberty
and
property,
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,"
was
their
ground
on
demurrer
and
the
ground
they
argued
through.
as
i
said,
if
your
honor
please,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case
is
purely
a
case
of
legislative
power
reduced
to
its
narrowest
sense.
does
the
legislature
have
the
power
to
enact
laws
in
this
area
and
think
the
answer
has
to
be
said
that
it
does
and
then
the
question
comes
up,
could
connecticut
go
too
far?
and
this
is
a
–
it's
said
that
this
is
a
dead
letter,
this
statute,
but
it
is
not.
every
two
years,
the
general
assembly
meets
in
hartford
and
people
troop
up,
and
this
is
one
of
the
most
hotly
debated
issues
before
the
connecticut
assembly.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
if
your
honor
please,
i
say
that
they
have
not
standing
to
raise
the
issues,
aside
from
freedom
of
speech,
and
aside
from
claims
of
liberty
and
properly.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
of
themselves.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
that
is
correct,
because
the
claim
that
they
made--incidentally,
the
claim
was
not
–
the
claim
has
never
been
made,
up
to
the
time
that
it
reached
this
court,
that
the
substantive
statute
was
void
on
its
face.
that
claim
was
made
here
throughout
the
case.
the
defendants
have
always
argued
that
as
the
statutes
here
would
be
applied
to
them
they
violated
certain
constitutional
rights.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
if
i
remember
correctly,
poe
and
ullman
was
in
1961.
we've
had
a
1961
session
of
the
legislature
and
bills
were
introduced.
i
think
i
cite
the
number
in
my
brief.
in
1961,
bills
were
introduced
and
they
never
came
out
of
committee.
they
went
to
both
houses
of
the
general
assembly.
in
1963,
other
bills
were
introduced.
the
bill
in
1963
was
to
repeal
the
statute.
the
house
passed
that,
149
to
66.
the
senate
committee
never
reported
the
bill
out.
now,
on
february
10th,
i
believe
it
was,
of
this
year,
a
bill
was
introduced.
i
have
a
copy
of
it
here.
i
don't
have
–
it
was
to
repeal
the
statute.
they
had
a
public
hearing
on
it
last
week.
traditionally
in
connecticut
bills
do
not
get
reported
out
until
late
in
the
session.
so
what
will
happen
this
session,
i
do
not
know.
but
this
is
something
that
comes
up.
there
are
bills
to
repeal
or
to
give
exceptions,
that
come
up
in
every
session
of
the
general
assembly.
and
as
you
will
note
in
our
brief,
a
good
part,
a
good
part
of
these
arguments
are
based
on
the
fact
that
there's
no
medical
need
for
–
i'm
sorry,
i
withdraw
that.
a
good
part
of
the
defendants'
arguments
and
a
good
part
of
the
brief
of
amicus
curiae
have
been
that
there
is
medical
necessity
involved
in
allowing
people
to
use
contraceptives.
now,
there
has
been
testimony
in
the
legislature
by
doctors,
prominent
in
the
field
of
obstetrics
and
gynecology,
that
there
is
no
medical
necessity
for
the
use
of
contraceptives,
absolutely
none.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
it's
not
a
medical
problem.
it
may
be
a
social
problem,
but
it's
not
a
medical
problem.
just
to
cite
some
of
the
examples
that
were
used
in
the
brief
of
the
planned
parenthood
league,
amicus
curiae
in
this
case,
there
was
a
whole
series
of
appendices
about
certain
types
of
women
who
should
not
have
a
child
and
certain
heart
conditions
were
listed
and
they
listed
a
whole
group
of
doctors,
some
who
say
they
shouldn't
have
children,
some
who
say
that
they
should
never
have
children,
and
some
who
say
that
they
should
seldom
have
children,
the
whole
tenor
of
which
is
that
there
are
some
women
that
shouldn't
have
any
children
at
all
and
the
testimony
to
the
legislature
has
been
that
in
this
particular
type
of
heart
condition
this
is
not
so.
the
difference
is
the
difference
between
pregnancy
control
and
birth
control
that
people
can,
this
type
of
pet
son
can
have
a
child.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
can
only
say
that
married
couples
do
not
have
freedom
to
do
what
they
want.
this
has
been
a
connecticut
decision,
and
this
is
the
connecticut
holding.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
no,
i
wouldn't
say
so,
if
your
honor
please,
but
parenthetically,
we
might
say
that,
under
the
welfare
powers,
that
this
is
practically
what's
happening
in
a
great
number
of
cases.
in
order
to
collect
welfare
people
must
do
this,
and
unfortunately
this
has
been
what
has
happened
under
the
welfare
legislation.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
there
is
a
bill.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
the
session
has
to
end
in
june.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
it's
either
the
first
or
the
last;
i
don't
know.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
they
have
had
committee
hearings,
a
joint
committee
hearing,
last
week.
the
bill
is
no.
2462,
house
bill
2462.
it's
a
simple
bill.
it
says,
"section
i,
section
5332
of
the
general
statutes
is
repealed.
this
act
shall
take
effect
from
its
passage;
section
2"
to
my
knowledge,
there
has
not
been
a
report
out
by
either
house
committee.
i
have
spoken
to
some
people
in
the
legislature,
and
it
is
the
opinion
that
i've
gotten
from
them
that
there
may
be
some
legislation
this
year,
but
it
probably
will
not
be
that
legislation.
there
might
be
some
legislation,
but
it
will
more
probably
be
similar
to
some
of
the
other
states'
restrictions
on
sales,
but
there
has
been
no
report
out.
this
is
all
conjecture
on
my
part.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
amending
this
statute,
i
might
–
probably
repealing
the
statute
as
written
and
substituting
therefore
–
now,
it
has
been
–
it
was
argued
before
that
some
other
amendments,
other
than
the
first
and
fourteenth,
were
brought
into
the
case.
we
heard
yesterday,
the
third,
the
ninth,
the
fourth,
and
possibly
the
fifth
amendment.
and
i
can
only
say
to
the
court
that
these
were
not
brought
up
in
the
record.
the
record
does
not
support
--
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
i
heard
this
–
i
made
a
note.
that
is
correct,
if
your
honor
please,
what
i'm
saying,
that
they
should
not
be
in
this
case,
that
they
were
not
in
the
record.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
it
might
have
relevance,
had
it
been
raised
at
the
proper
time,
because
the
connecticut
procedure,
which
i
understand
the
court
has
to
follow,
if
i
can
recall
a
note,
note
number
nine
in
the
majority
opinion
of
the
mapp
case
was
that
in
criminal
procedures
this
court
would
adopt
the
procedures
of
the
state
in
which
it
came
up
and
connecticut
has
very
strict
procedures
on
how
to
raise
issues.
i
point
them
out
in
my
brief.
now,
the
only
issues
that
were
raised
in
fact
--
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
you
have
to
allege
–
you
have
to
--
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
the
court
does
have
this
power,
yes,
especially
on
constitutional
questions
it
does,
but
generally
speaking,
the
court
restricts
you
to
the
ruling
that
you
have
made
–
the
errors
you
have
cited.
and,
as
we've
pointed
out,
there's
one
thing
that
was
brought
up
by
the
defendants
in
their
argument,
it
wasn't
cited
in
their
jurisdictional
grounds
and
that
is
this
–
the
fact
that
they
claim
they
were
cut
off
in
the
trial
level
from
getting
into
the
availability
of
contraceptives
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
and
i
quote
now
from
the
transcript
of
a
case,
because
i
want
to
be
exact
on
this,
on
page
47
and
48.
this
is
a
question
of
detective
berg,
a
member
of
the
new
haven
police
department,
called
as
a
state's
witness
–
cross-examination
by
ms.
royerbach,
page
47;
now,
in
the
course
of
your
investigations,
detective
berg,
did
you
ascertain
whether
these
products
and
he
is
referring
to
contraceptives,
were
available
anywhere
else
in
the
city
of
new
haven?
answer
-
i
did
not.
then
there
was
an
objection
taken.
now,
the
court
below
ruled
on
the
question
of
whether
the
objection
was
properly
taken
but
the
interesting
fact
of
the
case
is
that
the
answer
got
out
before
the
objection
did,
and
the
answer
was,
"i
did
not."
there's
no
place
else
in
the
record
that
the
availability
or
lack
of,
of
contraceptives
came
into
the
case
at
all.
they
were
not
precluded
from
bringing
this
up,
if
they
wanted
to
show
it,
not
that
we
would
say
that
it
would
make
any
difference.
assuming,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
you
could
purchase
any
type
of
contraceptive
any
place,
it'd
be
no
different,
it
seems
to
me,
than
being
able
to
buy
a
number,
which
you
can
buy,
i
must
admit,
almost
any
place.
it's
rather
difficult
to
enforce
the
gambling
laws.
any
statute
that
might
be
said
to
be
not
too
popular
is
not
easily
enforced.
in
short,
i
think
we
get
--
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
we
have
had
many
prosecutions,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice
and
yesterday
afternoon
at
the
conclusion
of
court,
the
other
gentlemen
that
had
sponsored
for
membership
in
the
bar,
were
all
prosecutors
or
assistant
prosecutors
of
circuit
courts
in
connecticut.
we
put
our
heads
together
and
it
seems
that
every
one
of
us
has
handled
cases
along
this
line.
now,
none
of
us,
parenthetically,
none
of
us
has
had
those
cases
go
out.
they've
always
been
disposed
of
for
one
reason
or
another.
i
know
i
handled
one
and
the
one
handled
involved
two
charges.
the
first
was
statutory
rape.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
statutory
rape.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
that
is
correct.[laughter]
and
therefore
the
second
charge
was
using
contraceptives.
in
this
case,
it
was
a
condom
on
the
part
of
the
man.
we
threw
this
out.
so
that,
in
the
books,
in
the
records,
you
don't
get
this
at
all.
now
in
the
other
cases,
one
of
the
gentlemen
told
me
that
he
had
a
case
of
some
high
school
children.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
they
had
high
school
children,
and
he
just
quietly
changed
the
charge.
he
thought
this
might
be
a
crime
and
it
might
come
back
and
haunt
them,
and
he
didn't
want
this
on
their
record.
so
he
just
disposed
of
the
case,
changed
the
charge
so
he
wouldn't
even
have
to
nolle
it.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
i
said
he
changed
the
charge,
your
honor,
so
he
wouldn't
have
to
nolle
it,
because
if
he
had
nolle'd
it,
the
charge
as
it
was
would
be
on
the
record.
he
substituted
a
charge
therefore,
breach
of
the
peace,
so
it
would
be
less.
now,
if
your
honors
pleases,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
other
side
has
pointed
out
that
massachusetts
–
that
connecticut
adopted
certain
views
from
massachusetts
cases,
specifically
the
gardner
case,
and
that
massachusetts
had
in
fact
later
changed
its
view.
and
that
is,
quoting
the
corbett
case
in
massachusetts
and
the
werlinsky
case
the
same
year,
that
in
order
to
prove
a
violation
of
their
sales
statutes
they
had
to
affirmatively
prove
that
these
devices
were
not
being
used
for
the
purpose
of
the
prevention
of
disease,
but
what
they
forgot
to
inform
the
court
was
that
four
years
later
there
was
another
massachusetts
case,
and
it's
a
case
of
commonwealth
versus
goldberg,
that
severally
changed
it
back
again,
by
convicting
a
druggist
who
had
condoms
on
display,
just
on
display.
and
they
held,
the
court
in
massachusetts
held,
that
the
specific
intent
did
not
have
to
be
proved
in
that
particular
case.
now
this
–
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
no,
that
was
a
massachusetts
supreme
court
case.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
no.
if
your
honor
please,
our
supreme
court
had
referred
to
the
gardner
case,
and
our
opponents
have
pointed
out
that
since
the
gardner
case
in
massachusetts,
the
two
other
cases
have
come
up
restricting
it;
and
i'm
just
pointing
out
that
since
the
cases
that
they
refer
to
come
up,
a
third
case
had
come
up
in
massachusetts
which
brings
it
back
nearer
to
the
original
gardner
case.
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
there
has
been
a
problem
that
prosecutions
in
connecticut
have
been
under
in
this
area,
and
it
could
be
seen
best
by
the
case
of
state
verses
certain
contraceptive
articles,
which
is
probably
one
of
the
more
cited
cases
in
connecticut
history.
at
the
lime
this
case
came
up
and
you
will
recall
that
this
was
the
companion
of
the
nelson
case;
this
was
a
raid
on
the
supply
center
of
the
waterbury
clinic,
health
center
or
clinic.
this
was
a
police
raid
on
the
basis
of
a
warrant.
now
at
the
time
that
this
came
up,
the
statute
that
empowered
the
warrant
was
the
gambling
statute.
connecticut
had
at
that
time
no
general
search
warrant
statute.
there
were
statutes
for
narcotics,
for
gambling,
for
firearms.
the
gambling
statute
read
something
to
the
effect
of,
"for
gaming,
gambling
or
other
crimes."
this
case,
this
warrant,
was
an
attempt
to
get
it
in
under
the
"or
other
crimes,"
and
the
connecticut
court
held,
and
i
believe
rightly
so,
that
the
"other
crimes"
listed
in
that
gambling
statute
were
other
clinics
of
the
same
ilk,
gambling,
et
cetera,
and
therefore
that
there
was
no
grounds
under
that
statute
for
issuing
a
search
warrant.
now,
that
case
has
been
cited
many
times
and
our
opponents
cite
it
for
the
fact
that
connecticut
cannot
condemn
or
claim
as
a
nuisance
contraceptives
and
i
don't
think
the
bare
import
of
that
case
can
be
used
to
cite
it
in
that
manner.
if
your
honors
please,
it
seems
that
what
the
court
here
is
being
asked
to
do,
as
i
started
to
say
yesterday,
is
to
overrule
gardner
and
overrule
the
case
of
margaret
sanger,
both
cases
in
which
this
court
has
held
that
it
was
within
the
power
of
the
states
to
control
these
contraceptive
clinics.
they
are
also
asking
the
court,
in
a
way,
to
overrule
the
tileston
case,
allowing
the
doctor
here
to
claim
rights,
the
so-called
of
the
patients,
although,
as
mr.
emerson
admitted
yesterday,
the
rights
of
the
doctor
in
this
case
are
essentially
the
rights
of
ms.
royerbach,
that
the
clinic
or
center
here
could
have
worked
without
a
doctor.
i
think
the
best
example
of
what
the
court
should
do,
at
least
according
to
our
way
of
looking
at
it,
was
the
words
of
mr.
justice
black
in
the
ferguson
case
in
1963,
because
actually,
what
we're
concerned
with
here
and
we
quote,
"we
are
not
concerned
with
the
wisdom,
need
or
appropriateness
of
the
legislation."
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
i
think
this
case,
if
your
honor
please,
with
the
way
it
comes
to
this
court,
is
economic.
these
are
people
running
a
business,
and
if
you
look
especially
at
mrs.
stevens,
the
stevens
woman
who
testified
for
the
state,
a
girl
married
less
than
a
year,
a
graduate
student,
her
husband
a
student.
she
was
charged
fifteen
dollars
by
this
center
for
a
tube
of
jelly.
now,
we've
heard
arguments
about
poverty,
and
i'm
not
that
long
myself
from
college
to
know
that
fifteen
dollars
is
an
awful
lot
of
money
and
it
just
seems
to
me
that
these
people
were
running
a
business.
it's
that
simple.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
that's
the
stumbling
point.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
there's
no
question
about
that,
if
your
honor
please,
but
i
think
the
issue
can
be
avoided
on
the
grounds
that
these
individuals
can
achieve
the
same
result
by
different
means,
by
not
using
contraceptives.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
possibly,
but
i
think
also
that
it's
too
bad,
in
a
way,
that
this
case
came
up
now
and
i
say
that
because,
in
the
last
year
or
so,
there
appears
to
have
been
fantastic
work
done
in
this
field.
now,
i
cite
in
our
brief
an
article
in
the
–
i
don't
recall
the
page
in
the
brief
–
but
i
cite
an
article
in
the
linacre
quarterly,
a
february
1965
issue,
where
a
boston
gynecologist
has
come
up
with
a
method
of
being
able
to
pinpoint
ovulation
to
one
day
in
a
cycle.
now,
if
this
works
out,
if
this
is
so,
then
contraceptives
–
that
is,
devices
that
are
being
used
to
prevent
pregnancy
will
be
passe.
there
will
be
no
need,
there
will
just
be
no
need.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
well,
those
methods,
if
your
honor
please,
it
would
be
impossible,
absolutely
impossible,
because
those
methods
would
involve
a
rhythm
system,
which
the
state
has
held
does
not
violate
this
statute.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
i
suppose
–
i
don't
think
so.
i
would
not
claim
that.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
well,
if
your
honor
please,
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
state
can
argue
that
people
cannot
go
outside
their
own
homes
and
get
things
and
use
them
in
their
own
homes.
now,
this
is
not
to
say
that
people
can
just
--
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
i
suppose
that
it
might.
mr.
joseph
b.
clark
but
it's
not
at
issue
here
before
the
court.
