mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
section
6531
of
the
internal
revenue
code
prescribes
a
six-year
statute
of
limitations
for
the
criminal
offense
of
tax
of
willful
tax
evasion.
but
it
authorizes
an
extension
of
that
six-year
period
if,
“a
complaint
it
instituted
before
a
commissioner
of
the
united
states
during
the
six
years.”
the
only
serious
question
before
this
court
now
as
petitioners
conceded
is,
what
the
meaning
of
those
words
is
notwithstanding
references
to
the
fourth
amendment
in
petitioner's
brief.
there's
obviously
no
constitutional
issue
here.
petitioner
was
not
arrested.
he
was
not
subjected
to
a
search.
the
only
question
here
is
where
the
petitioner's
right
of
repose
which
was
conferred
by
a
statute
as
by
congress
could
--
could
be
interrupted
by
a
complaint
of
the
sort
which
was
filed
here.
if
for
example,
the
statute
rather
than
providing
for
a
complaint
to
be
filed,
had
just
provided
that
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
send
a
letter
to
any
taxpayer
whose
statute
of
limitations
he
would
extend,
that
statute
would
clearly
be
constitutional
and
petitioners
conceded
as
much
here.
the
only
basis
for
arguing
that
there's
any
requirement
or
probable
cause
or
any
requirement
of
convincing
a
commissioner
that
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
a
perspective
defendant
guilty
is
that
the
statute
has
used
the
word
“complaint”
and
that
is
if
you
talk
about
it
in
terms
of
its
being
instituted
before
a
commissioner.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
justice
stewart.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
concede
that
it's
covered
by
rule
3
but
we
think
it's
not
covered
by
rule
4
since
there
was
no
attempt
made
to
arrest
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
they
--
a
summons
was
issued
but
the
summons
was
nothing
more
than
a
notice
to
him
in
effect
that
the
complaint
had
been
filed.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
commissioner,
justice
harlan,
i
think
in
this
case
is
there
to
take
the
oath
or
at
least
to
receive
the
signed
and
sworn
statement
which
formally
accuses
the
defendant
of
a
--
of
a
crime
that
formally
institutes
the
proceeding
if
they
were
just
the
sworn
affidavits
sent
to
the
defendant
then
there's
no
proceeding
instituted
in
a
court.
and
we
think
the
reason
that
congress
provided
for
a
complaint
before
a
commissioner
is
that
it
wanted
the
government
to
be
put
to
the
burden
of
filing
a
sworn
accusation
against
the
defendant
before
it
would
be
entitled
to
extend
the
statutory
period
but
nothing
more
than
just
an
accusation
under
oath.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no
justice
douglas,
i
don't
think
a
machine
could
have,
because
--
you
mean
it
replace
the
commissioner
or
that
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
a
machine
were
an
agency
of
a
court,
i
would--
mr.
nathan
lewin
--
think
it
could,
yes,
if
it
were
an
arm
of
the
court.
i
think
that
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
think
that
would
have
started
a
proceeding
justice
brennan
and
i
think
that's
why
the
congress
made
a
complaint.
congress
wanted
the
government
to
know
that
it's
instituting
although
not
with
all
the
publicity
or
notoriety
or
formal
accusation
of
an
indictment,
it
is
instituting
a
criminal
action
against
this
man
and
it
should
do
--
it
should
do
so
only
if
it
has
sufficient
evidence
then
at
its
disposal
to
be
able
to
proceed
with
a
criminal
action
not
merely
to
file
an
affidavit.
mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
chief
justice,
alternatively
in
our
brief,
we
argue
that
this
complaint
constituted
probable
cause
in
the
fourth
amendment
sense.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
that
he
could
--
i
think
alternatively
--
our
alternative
argument
is
that
he
could
have
been
arrested.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
--
our
first
argument
would
be
that
he
could
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
we
would
admit
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
our
second
is
that
he
could.
in
other
words
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
i
think
under
our
second
argument,
it
would
have
to
be
sufficient.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
argue
alternatively
that
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
i
will
--
i've
reserved
that
for
the
very
end
of
my
argument
if
i
have
time.
if
not,
we'll
rest
on
our
brief.
i
would
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
sir.
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
it
is
sufficient.
we
ague
that
it's
sufficient
because
the
agent
has
said
that
he
has
looked
at
particular
books
and
records,
interviewed
people
and
that
he
concluded
at
his
own
personal
knowledge
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
this
petitioner
committed
the
offense.
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
is
no
case
of
--
no
case
decided
by
this
court,
mr.
chief
justice
that
would
--
that
would
sustain.
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
only
decisions
of
other
courts
have
been
those
involving
the
identical
kind
of
complaint,
in
other
words
a
complaint
under
section
6531.
and
they
have
said
that
this
is
sufficient
to
sustain
an
arrest
or
all
the
proceedings
under
rule
4.
those
are
cases
like
sanseverino
which
was
recently
decided
by
the
ten
--
tenth
circuit.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
under
--
again
i'm
afraid
i'll
have
to
distinguish
between
our
--
our
personal
alternative
arguments
that
i'm
--
i
think
that
the
united
states
attorney
on
our
first
argument
would
not
be
able
to
have
him
arrested
mr.
chief
justice.
under
our
second,
i
think
he
could
ask
for
a
warrant
of
arrest
and
rule
4
provides.
mr.
nathan
lewin
by
no
means,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
should
have.
mr.
nathan
lewin
what
is
to
determine
is
the
phrase
of
the
complaint
and
what
it
states
and
what
the
commissioner
could
conclude
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
before
him
which
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
absolutely.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
he
could.
mr.
nathan
lewin
to
that
extent,
yes
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
exactly
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i
--
i
believe
he
does
have
the
additional
function
that
justice
goldberg
just
referred
to,
to
look
at
the
phase
of
the
complaint
and
see
whether
it
does
state
an
offense.
the
government
couldn't
extend
the
statute
of
limitations
simply
by
a
paper
which
didn't
accuse
anybody
of
anything.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
yes
sir.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
exactly
what
the
case
comes
down
to.
petitioner
contends
that
what
has
to
be
--
what
has
to
be
meant
in
this
case
are
all
the
requirements
of
rule
4
and
all
the
requirements
that
would
have
to
be
meant
by
a
complaint
in
order
to
support
a
warrant
of
arrest.
we
say
that
all
that
the
complaint
has
to
state
is
what
rule
3
provides
for
it
which
by
the
way
rule
3
is
framed
in
almost
identical
language
to
--
to
that
in
rule
7
which
covers
indictments.
and
our
contention
is
that
all
that's
required
of
a
complaint
is
that
the
accusation
of
a
particular
individual
with
the
kind
of
specificity
that
would
be
required
of
an
indictment
or
an
information.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
to
the
extent
that
rule
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
to
the
extent
that
rule
3
could
be
read
that
way,
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
wouldn't
read
it
that
way
from
purposes
of
this
complaint.
now,
we
would
say
that
one
of
the
essential
facts
that
would
have
to
be
charged
for
purposes
of
this
kind
of
a
complaint
would
be
that
this
particular
dependant
had
committed
the
offense.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
because
4
just
provides
for
the
next
step
that
a
commissioner
has
to
take
if
he
is
to
issue
a
warrant
of
arrest
or
a
summons
which
will
compel
a
defendant
to
appear
before
it.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
should
show
--
it
should
show
what
an
indictment
shows
which
is
including
the
names
of
the
defendant
that
a
particular
defendant
committed
an
offense
in
a
particular
manner.
the
accusation
that
he's
committed
the
offense
and
of
course
it
must
be
under
oath.
now,
we
think
that's
the
additional
protection
that
congress
meant
to
afford
to
taxpayers
in
this
kind
of
case.
mr.
nathan
lewin
for
the
--
i
think
technically
under
rule
3
that
would
be
all
that
would
be
required.
i
think
for
the
protection
of
--
of
taxpayers
and
generally
in
order
to
implement
the
purpose
behind
the
statute,
the
government
has
drafted
this
form
to
indicate
under
oath
that
there
has
been
a
conscientious
investigation
performed
under
the
supervision
or
to
the
knowledge
of
the
affiant.
mr.
nathan
lewin
rule
3
does
not
require
but
we
think
for
purposes
--
we're
willing
to
concede
that
for
purposes
of
section
6531
that
should
be
in
an
affidavit
and
i
--
i'd
like
to
get
to
that
if
i
could.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we've
taken
that
position
i've
been
told
in
a
few
district
courts
but
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i'm
told
that
we've
taken
this
--
that
we
have
taken
this
position
but
it
need
not
show
probable
cause.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
it
has.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
up
until
now.
but
i
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
the
ninth
circuit
has
decided.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
i'm
hoping
to
save
time
for
that
mr.
justice
harlan
but
i
--
i
was
hoping
to
make
clear
at
the
outset
although
i'm
far
from
the
outset
at
this
point
that
the
government
is
not
seeking
to
use
and
has
never
sought
to
use
this
statute
to
extend
the
limitations
period
in
order
to
conduct
an
investigation
when
it
doesn't
have
evidence
of
the
conclusion
of
the
six-year
period.
in
other
words,
our
interest
is
not
to
vindicate
any
right
just
to
file
a
complaint
and
then
go
out
and
investigate
to
gather
the
evidence
to
support
that
complaint.
we
set
out
at
pages
11
to
13
of
our
brief
the
extensive
review
and
rereview
that
these
kinds
of
cases
go
through
in
the
internal
revenue
service
itself
and
in
the
department
of
justice
before
the
decision
to
file
a
complaint
is
made.
and
there
is
invariably
more
than
sufficient
evidence
at
that
stage
in
the
government's
files
to
establish
probable
cause.petitioner
asks
then
why
the
government
cannot
show
probable
cause
in
its
complaint.
and
i
think
the
answer
isquite
simple.
the
reason
that
we're
objecting
to
any
rule
which
would
require
us
to
set
out
probable
cause
in
the
complaint
for
the
satisfaction
of
a
commissioner
is
due
to
the
serious
harm
that
this
would
do
in
a
variety
of
ways
to
the
administration
of
the
internal
revenue
laws
in
its
criminal
aspects.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no
mr.
justice
brennan.
this
statute
is
unique
in
our
--
insofar
as
we
know
and
we
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
the
reason
is
that
very
possibly
that
until
giordenello
it
was
believed
by
the
government
agents,
the
internal
revenue
service
and
the
department
of
justice
that
any
affidavit
filed
by
an
internal
revenue
agent
stating
that
of
his
personal
knowledge
he
knew
that
a
person
who
have
committed
an
offense
would
be
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
fourth
amendment.
after
giordenello,
certain
other
particulars
were
put
into
this
complaint.
and
at
--
at
this
stage
there
is
honestly,
mr.
chief
justice,
some
doubts
to
whether
it
would
satisfy
the
fourth
amendment
requirement
after
this
court's
decision
in
aguilar.
on
reexamining
the
whole
problem,
we've
concluded
that
there
really
should
be
no
need
to
--
to
state
probable
cause
at
all
in
the
complaint
because
the
congress
just
didn't
intend
it
and
because
we
think
it
would
--
a
requirement
that
the
commissioner
examined
this
would
have
a
damaging
effect.
if
i
can
just
go
at,
go
in
detail
to
this,
i'll
attempt
to
do
so.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
this
goes
back
to
your
question
during
petitioner's
argument,
mr.
justice
black.
you
asked
whether
a
complaint
can
be
amended.
in
effect,
this
complaint
is
a
one
shot
affair.
it's
filed
by
the
government
one,
two,
three
days
before
the
statute
of
limitations
runs.
the
government
puts
into
it
what
it
made
if
--
what
it
may
believe
to
be
probable
cause.
it
has
much
more
certainly
because
the
case
has
been
reviewed
and
rereviewed
in
the
department
of
justice
and
in
the
service.
a
commissioner
may
mistakenly
say,
“well,
this
is
sufficient,”
as
the
commissioner
did
in
this
case.”
and
then
if
a
court
at
a
later
date
concludes
that
it's
not
then
there's
absolutely
no
way
of
repairing
the
damage
that
the
injury
done
in
the
government
is
far
greater
in
this
case
than
it
is
in
a
search
and
seizure
or
arrest
case
where
the
only
things
that
are
excluded
are
the
fruit
of
any
unconstitutional
arrest
or
any
unconstitutional
search.
here
we
have
a
complaint
as
to
--
as
to
a
proceeding
which
doesn't
involve
in
anyway,
any
questions
of
constitutional
dimensions
and
nonetheless
if
as
it
turns
out
a
commissioner
was
wrong
and
the
government
was
wrong
on
the
question
of
probable
cause
which
this
court
just
last
week
in
ventresca
said
raised
some
difficult
problems
in
particular
cases
then
the
defendant
is
entirely
immune.
his
limitations
period
has
expired
and
he
can
say,
“well
no
matter
what
other
evidence
you
had
back
there,
it's
too
late
for
you
now
to
assert
it
in
order
to
extend
the
statute.
your
complaint
didn't
have
it.”
if
we
were
required
to
show
probable
cause
then,
the
only
alternative
left
for
the
government
particularly
considering
the
--
the
peculiarity
of
a
tax
evasion
case
would
be
just
to
in
effect
bring
out
the
entire
agent's
report
and
all
the
supporting
evidence.
the
agent's
report
in
this
case
had
been
referred
to
in
the
record
and
it
comes
to
61
pages
in
a
181
exhibits
and
many
of
those
petitioners
would
contend
are
hearsay.
so
--
so
we
have
to
bring
out
affidavits
of
these
--
these
prospective
witnesses.
mr.
nathan
lewin
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
think
in
--
in
tax
evasion
cases
particularly
in
net
worth
prosecutions
which
come
to
40%
of
the
tax
evasion
cases,
there
would
be
great
difficulty
because
the
government's
entire
case
doesn't
rest
on
any
single
thread
or
any
single
item
which
could
be
removed
from
the
--
the
full
picture
of
the
case.
the
government's
case
essentially
rests
on
a
large
volume
of
evidence
which
indicates
increases
in
net
worth
over
a
course
of
years
and
the
fact
that
these
increases
are
unexplained.
now,
unless
the
government
set
out
all
the
evidence
for
the
beginning
net
worth
or
at
starting
net
worth
and
everything
that
happened
thereafter,
i
don't
think
that
they
really
would
be
enough
for
a
commissioner
to
determine
that
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
man
committed
the
offense.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
true
but
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
it's
not
an
onerous
requirement
in
most
of
the
cases.
but
i
--
i
believe
that
is
an
onerous
requirement
in
--
in
the
tax
field
because
taking
mr.
shenker's
illustration
the
fact
that
somebody
said
or
that
the
petitioner
said
to
somebody,
“give
me
cash."
well
that's
not
probable
cause.i
--
i
think
the
petitioner
would
be
up
here
arguing
the
very
same
claim
he's
making
now
if
that
were
in
this
comp
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
right.
but
this
--
this
you
say,
justice
goldberg,
just
wouldn't
go
to
the
commissioner
of
the
offense.
the
fact
that
he's
received
cash
wouldn't
demonstrate
that
he
has
committed
the
offense
of
tax
evasion.
to
turn
now
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
as
to
how
this
case
is
different
from
girodenello
and
why
the
standard
should
be
different,
we
believe
it's
important
to
consider
what
the
interest
of
the
taxpayer
or
of
the
defendant
in
this
case
is
as
compared
with
the
interest
of
a
defendant
in
a
giordenello
type
situation.
here,
all
that's
involved
is
the
right
of
repose
which
the
congress
has
granted
by
statute.
and
the
question
is
essentially
whether
a
taxpayer
should
be
entitled
or
should
be
protected
by
some
requirement
that
the
government
set
out
evidence
in
a
complaint
against
an
extension
of
the
right
or
against
an
extension
of
the
period
where
he
will
not
have
repose.
it
certainly
a
far
cry
from
the
constitutionally
protected
rights
of
arrest
or
search
which
are
involved
in
fourth
amendment
cases.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes.
mr.
nathan
lewin
no,
but
--
but
we
think
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
think
what
can
happen
though
mr.
justice
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
if
that
were
true,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
rule
3
would
say
that
a
complaint
has
to
have
probable
cause.
mr.
nathan
lewin
it
at
least
has
--
if
our
contentions
accepted
it
at
least
has
the
good
of
extending
the
statute
of
limitation
and
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
under
this
particular
statute.
it's
an
institution.
it
begins
a
proceeding.
and
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
nathan
lewin
a
summons
is
i
think
one
method
of
giving
a
notice
but
i
think
the
commissioner
could
just
send
in
notice
in
any
other
fashion
and
he
would
still
be
satisfying
section
6531.
mr.
nathan
lewin
or
the
government
would
serve
notice
of
--
of
this
complaint
defined.
now,
the
diff
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
we're
writing
it
out
for
purposes
of
this
statute
because
we
just
don't
think
it
apply
to
this
statute
although
congress
used
the
word
“complaint”,
we
don't
believe
that
congress
meant
to
carry
with
it
the
entire
machinery
of
--
of
investigations
for
probable
cause
and
searches
for
that
with
the
probable
cause.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well
if
it
is,
and
i
really
hadn't
heard
of
that,
mr.
justice
black.
but
if
it
is
then
i
think
that
--
that
applies
here
as
well.
we're
not
arresting
anybody.
we're
just
notifying
him
that
the
statute
of
limitations
is
extended
for
nine
months.
and
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
think
both.
i
think
the
commissioner
would
make
the
determination
as
well
as
the
united
stated
attorney
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
the
united
states
attorney
made
it
here.
he
never
asked
for
an
arrest
warrant
issue.
and
rule
4
provides
that
it's
only
--
well,
it
would
be
on
the
request
of
united
stated
attorney
that
an
arrest
warrant
would
issue.
mr.
nathan
lewin
unless
the
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
if
the
complaint
states.
mr.
nathan
lewin
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
mr.
nathan
lewin
that's
right.
insofar
as
the
--
the
protection
or
the
right
of
the
defendant
is
asserting
here,
i
--
i
think
it's
of
quite
a
parallel
to
this
--
to
this
court's
recent
decision
in
the
powell
and
ryan
cases
in
the
area
of
administrative
subpoenas
by
internal
revenue
agents.
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
despite
a
statute
stating
that
there
could
be
no
unnecessary
examination
of
a
taxpayer's
records
unless
of
course
it's
the
civil
analogue
of
this
kind
of
criminal
provision,
nonetheless,
no
notion
of
probable
cause
or
anything
like
it
would
apply
to
--
before
an
administrative
subpoena
before
a
taxpayer's
records
could
be
issued.
essentially
what
the
government
is
urging
is
that
all
that
we
need
to
show
in
the
complaint
then
is
that
for
purposes
of
section
6531
is
that
there's
been
a
conscientious
investigation
and
that
the
person
conducting
that
investigation
believes
under
oath
that
the
defendant
is
guilty.
the
conscientious
investigation
part
although
not
required
by
rule
3
we
think
is
--
in
its
protection
to
defendant
so
that
the
ordinary
government
policy
which
is
not
to
file
these
complaints
unless
we
have
had
a
conscientious
investigation
and
unless
it
is
believed
that
there
is
enough
--
enough
to
go
to
a
grand
jury
and
to
convict
the
defendants
will
apply
in
every
particular
case.
mr.
nathan
lewin
well,
it's
not
a
requirement
but
that's
--
that's
--
that's
the
way
we
--
we've
set
this
procedure
up
administratively.
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
is
no
requirement
such
as
that
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
there
is
no
such
as
that.
there
is
no
such
requirement
in
the
rule
specifically
in
the
statute.
mr.
nathan
lewin
but
we
think
that
to
the
extent
that
this
--
that
this
court
would
go
beyond
rule
3
to
protect
the
defendant
in
this
kind
of
situation
against
a
whimsical
or
capricious
extension
when
the
government
has
no
evidence,
we
think
it's
adequately
protected
when
you
require
that
kind
of
a
paper
to
be
filed.
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
get
this
requirement
not
out
of
--
not
out
of
the
statute
but
just
simply
to
protect
defendants.
i
--
i
agree
that
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
requirements
mr.
justice
stewart.
in
conclu
--
mr.
nathan
lewin
we
must
accuse
the
defendant
under
oath
in
a
--
of
having
committed
the
offense
in
a
specific
year
and
in
a
specific
manner.
in
other
words,
the
kind
of
requirement
that's
required
by
--
of
an
indictment,
it's
the
very
same
type
of
minimal
provisions
that
would
be
required
of
an
indictment
or
for
that
matter
of
--
of
an
information.
this
may
very
well
have
been
congress'
method
of
saying,
“well,
when
you
can't
proceed
by
information
because
it's
an
indictable
offense
nonetheless
when
a
grand
jury
is
not
in
session
and
that
was
the
original
purpose
of
the
statute,
to
cover
the
case
when
a
grand
jury
and
it
was
not
in
session,
you
may
file
the
equivalent
of
--
of
an
information
sort
of
just
to
extend
the
statute
until
you
can
get
this
case
to
a
grand
jury.
mr.
nathan
lewin
i
don't
know
what
the
practice
is,
mr.
justice
black.
i'd
suspect
that
if
--
if
the
government
tried
to
amend
the
complaint
which
was
filed
on
the
day
the
statutes
of
limitations
told
and
thereafter
try
to
put
in
probable
cause
into
the
complaint,
i
would
suspect
that
it'd
be
rejected
because
it
would
then
become
the
complaint
or
the
--
the
effective
portion
of
the
complaint
would
then
have
been
putting
to
the
case
after
the
--
after
the
statute
of
limitations
had
expired.
so
i
think
it
would
really
be
necessary
for
the
government
to
make
--
take
that
one
shot
and
get
everything
into
that
one
complaint
or
else
suffer
the
fact
that
the
--
that
the
limitations
period
had
expired.
