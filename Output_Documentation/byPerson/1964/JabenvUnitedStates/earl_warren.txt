chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
challenge
that
before
--
before
you
pleaded
a
nolo
contendere?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
challenge
the
sufficiency?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
he
presented
before
the
commissioner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
question
the
power
of
extending
the
statute
of
limitations
in
this
manner
under
the
constitution,
do
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
under
the
--
under
the
statute,
could
the
commissioner
have
issued
a
warrant
of
arrest
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
could?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
said
--
it
alleges
that
there
are
some
familiar
people
in
investigation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
anything
has
been
said
in
the
complaints
before
us.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
lewin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
he
have
been
arrested
--
could
he
have
been
arrested
under
this
complaint?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that
isn't
what
i
ask.
i
asked
could
he
have
been
arrested
instead
of
having
a
summons
sent
to
him
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
not
talking
about
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
asking
you
as
a
matter
of
law
he
could
have
been
arrested
under
this
complaint
rather
than
just
as
having
a
sent
--
summon
sent
to
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what's
your
second?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
let's
take
--
take
the
one
that
he
could.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
he
could
be
--
could
be
arrested
and
would
the
complaint
have
to
be
sufficient
to
--
to
sustain
a
warrant
of
arrest?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
is
this
affidavit
is
sufficient
to
sustain
a
warrant
of
arrest?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
would
like
to
know
it
now,
if
you
don't
mind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
cited
the
cases
in
your
--
in
your
brief
to
show
that
this
is
adequate
for
--
to
sustain
an
arrest?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
in
any
other
courts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i've
got
one
more
question
and
i
--
i
won't
bother
you
anymore.
but
do
you
think
that
it's
within
the
discretion
of
the
--
of
the
united
states
attorney
to
either
send
him
a
summons
or
have
him
arrested
in
determining
whether
this
complaint
is
sufficient?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that
if
he
--
if
he
could
have
then
do
you
think
the
question
of
the
validity
of
this
--
this
complaint
should
depend
upon
the
discretion
of
the
united
states
attorney
as
to
whether
the
man
should
be
arrested
or
should
be
summoned.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
to
determine
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
--
that
means
the
validity
of
the
affidavit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we
don't
think
it
would
--
it
would
cause
so
much
harm
to
the
administration
of
tax
laws.
why
wasn't
that
idea
conceived
before
this?
why
is
--
why
have
you
taken
the
other
position
through
the
years
than
the
court
had
it
just
now
take
in
this
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
then
does
it
require
to
just
get
right
down
if
you
say
that
doesn't
--
isn't
required
just
how
little
or
much
you
say
in
order
to
satisfy
this
statute.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
shenker.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
