justice
hugo

black
suppose
the
complaint
have
been
definite.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
had
been
definite.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
complaint
there
amendable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
it
seems
to
me
your
question
is
a
little
narrow
than
you
stated
in
the
beginning.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
only
question
was
whether
the
filing
of
the
complaint
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
hold
the
limitations
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
is
effective
complaint?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
your
plea
based
on
that
complaint?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
not
based
on
any
complaint
of
indictment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
was
a
summons
that
you
gave,
wasn't
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
was
sent
at
a
certain
date
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
for
preliminary
hearing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
was
the
defendant
there
that
day?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
object?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
he
--
did
he
--
what
happened
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
object
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
did
request
for
a
hearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
object
to
this
affidavit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say,
it
may
be
right
but
i
didn't
think
that
preliminary
investigation
of
that
time
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
commission
if
they
allow
an
amendment
to
complaint
preliminary
which
decides
nothing
except
whether
a
man
could
be
bound
the
witness
against
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
didn't
deal
with
the
tolling
of
the
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
therein,
i
thought
those
were
very
informal
proceedings,
those
who
are
advocated
and
you
just
suspect
it
here
before
the
justices
here
whether
a
man
could
be
bound
notice
and
that
the
judge
and
the
administrators,
justices
of
peace
or
the
commissioner
could
gain
all
evidence.
if
he
thinks
it's
necessary,
i
hope
he
could
get
an
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
wasn't
--
it
was
within
the
statutory
period.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
in
six
years?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
within
six
years.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
original.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
congress
said
that
if
it
was
filed
within
nine
months
after
its
--
the
limits
within
that
period
that
they
had
to
be
given
ten
months
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
extension.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
other
filing
of
complaints.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
for
preliminary
hearing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
read
it
and
it
seems
to
me
and
i
gather
that
there
indeed
was
substance.
it
might
not
have
been
just
the
whole
of
the
matter.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
a
violation
of
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
(inaudible)
that
they
--
that
require
the
same
burden
of
proof
showing
in
an
affidavit
for
a
complaint.
that
he
was
required
to
file
amendment
before
a
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
it
doesn't
go
into
detail
on
when
he
took
the
money
or
how
he
did
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
could
search
the
books.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
said
he
talks
to
people
with
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
he
ought
to
give
their
names?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
a
damaging
effect
on
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
isn't
it
becoming
very
common
in
many
places
now,
considered
a
great
reform
to
do
away
with
arresting
people
and
notifying
be
it
somewhere
at
a
certain
time?
i
thought
that
was
a
--
one
of
the
modern
ideas
of
improving
our
system.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
did
make
it
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
before
you
quit,
would
you
--
do
you
know
what
the
practice
is
with
reference
to
amendments
of
both
commissioner
and
the
charges.
