mr.
lewin,
do
you
think
the
commissioner
could
dismiss
the
complaint
under
rule
3
if
he
doesn't
state
the
essential
facts
constituting
an
offense
charged?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
so
the
commissioner
therefore
has
more
than
a
machine
function
to
perform,
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
so
that
this
paper
that
is
to
be
filed
and
you
say
must
meet
the
requirements
of
rule
3,
in
any
event,
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
that
--
that's
your
first
phase
of
the
argument?
it
was
not
just
to
keep
notice,
not
just
a
statement
that
the
government
wants
the
statute
and
limitations
extended.
the
government
is
required
it
under
the
act
of
congress
to
file
a
complaint.
the
complaint
under
rule
3
is
required
to
be
in
a
written
statement
of
the
essential
facts
constituted
with
the
offense
charged.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
say,
having
met
that
test
that's
all
it's
required.

he'd
