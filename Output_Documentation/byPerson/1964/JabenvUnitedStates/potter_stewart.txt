justice
potter
stewart
there
had
been
an
information.
justice
potter
stewart
unless
you
waived
it
in
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
your
contention
is
that
the
complaint
has
to
show
probable
cause,
a
probable
cause
for
what?
justice
potter
stewart
probable
cause
to
support
an
arrest
under
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
not
a
search,
we're
not
talking
about
a
search.
justice
potter
stewart
to
support
an
arrest
of
the
defendant
person.
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
don't
you
concede
that
this
is
--
covered
by
rule
3?
justice
potter
stewart
the
kind
of
a
complaint
covered
by
rule
3?
justice
potter
stewart
the
federal
language
of
rule
3
doesn't
--
the
basic
difference
as
i
see
between
rule
3
and
rule
4
is
that
rule
3
doesn't
have
to
tie
it
up
to
any
particular
defendant.
rule
4
does.
rule
3
just
says
that
an
offense
has
been
committed,
the
essential
facts
that
an
offense
has
been
committed.
and
i
suppose
under
its
literal
language
we
can
--
a
complaint
can
say,
we
don't
know
who
has
committed
it
although
we
--
so
we
name
john
doe
and
richard
roe
and
so
on.
and
rule
3
brings
it
down
to
a
specific
person
or
persons
on
rule
4.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
a
basic
difference,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
that
case
what's
the
difference
between
3
and
4?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then,
do
i
understand
you
to
just
please
telling
us
that
a
complaint
under
rule
3
need
not
show
probable
cause
to
believe
that
an
offense
has
been
committed
and
that
the
particular
person
has
committed
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
need
--
what
--
should
it
show
what
need?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lewin,
i
know
we've
fully
interrupted
you
and
i
apologize
for
doing
it.
but
you
had
--
you
have
told
us
that
the
complaint
mentioned
in
section
6531
is
--
is
the
kind
of
a
complaint
embodied
and
referred
to
in
rule
3.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
think
i
understand
you
told
us
that.
well
now,
under
rule
3
a
complaint
has
to
show
probable
cause
in
order
to
have
any
effectiveness
at
all
in
order
for
anything
to
happen
under
rule
4,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
you
can't
just
file
a
lottery
ticket
under
rule
3.
justice
potter
stewart
then
if
you
file
anything
short
of
showing
probable
cause
then
nothing
can
happen.
that
complaint
is
ineffective
to
have
any
operation
under
rule
4
because
rule
4
is
what's
--
provides
for
an
arrest
or
a
summons,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
so
doesn't
rule
4
measures
what
a
complaint
has
to
show
under
rule
3?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
there
are
complaints
without
probable
cause,
what
happens?
what
good
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
under
this
particular
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
know
that.
justice
potter
stewart
you
find
that
a
requirement?
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
you're
right,
if
you're
right,
there's
no
such
requirement
as
that.
justice
potter
stewart
does
that
say
john
smith,
i
believe
john
smith
violated
the
--
evaded
his
taxes
fraudulently.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you're
right
there
is
no
such
requirement
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
well
who
--
where
does
this
requirement
come
from
--
either
there's
a
fourth
amendment
requirement
or
a
rule
4
requirement
or
there
is
no
requirement
at
all
if
you're
right.
we
just
get
this
requirement
if
you
think
it's
a
nice
thing
to
do
or
what?
