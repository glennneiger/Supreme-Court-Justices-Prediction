justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
that
the
congress
had
simply
provided
on
the
filing
of
the
sworn
affidavit
period
in
the
district
court
would
that
have
started
a
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
this
mean
for
use
to
--
we
must
examine
the
complaint
too
whether
it
is
“a
written
statement
of
the
essential
facts
constituting
the
offense
charged”.
this
is
under
your
first
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
--
and
if
it
was
not
so,
he
can
refuse
to
accept
it,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
refuse
to
--
to
notarize
or
whatever
that
says.is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that's
an
--
it
gets
down
to
the
distinction
between
a
written
statement
of
the
offense
of
facts
constituted
on
the
offense
charged
and
the
requirements
of
rule
4,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
mr.
lewin
under
the
--
all
it
really
need
on
your
view,
am
i
right,
is
what
appears
in
the
last
eight
to
ten
lines
of
the
complaint?
everything
that
preceded
it
was
unnecessary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
government's
position
is
that
rule
3
does
not
require
that
much.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
offhand
mr.
lewin,
do
you
know
of
any
other
situations
where
the
government
might
make
this
claim
that
in
other
words
that
the
complaint
short
of
one
would
show
its
probable
cause
and
filed
before
a
commissioner?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
admitted
though
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
say
he
made
a
request
--
the
commissioner
questions
(inaudible)
is
that
what
leaves
him
to
do
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
common
sense
says
the
word
shall.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
(inaudible)
for
future
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
other
form
of
notice
would
be
(inaudible)
