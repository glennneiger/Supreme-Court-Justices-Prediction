mr.
morris
a.
shenker
--
of
limitations
and
so
forth
as
the
year
19
--
the
evasion
that
is
charged
on
count
one
for
the
year
1956.
however,
the
government
in
order
to
attempt
to
toll
the
running
of
the
statute
had
issued
a
complaint
and
filed
a
complaint
before
the
united
states
commissioner
on
april
the
15th,
1963.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
the
second
and
third
counts
your
honor
are
not
affected
because
they
were
dismissed.
the
only
count
that
we
are
concerned
with
here
is
the
first
count
which
is
of
1956.
after
the
complaint
--
the
indictment
was
filed,
appropriate
motions
were
filed
wherein
we
sought
to
have
the
count
one
dismissed.
the
other
motions
that
we
filed
today
are
the
counts
of
course
are
not
applicable
and
we
sought
count
one
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
it
was
brought
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
contention
was
by
the
government
that
the
filing
of
the
complaint
tolled
the
statute
of
limitations
under
section
6531.
after
the
motions
were
overruled
they
then
filed
a
--
an
amended
motion
when
the
greenberg
case
were
decided
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
then
it
was
overruled
also
so
the
defendant
stand
enter
the
plea
of
nolo
contendere
to
count
one
of
the
indictment.
on
the
plea
of
nolo
contendere,
the
court
found
the
defendant
guilty
and
assessed
punishment
of
two
years
and
to
penitentially
suspended
20
months
after
he
would
have
served
four
months.
the
defendant
is
now
out
of
--
the
appellant
is
now
out
on
--
on
bail.
the
real
question
then
that
is
before
this
court
is
really
there's
only
one
question.
whether
the
complaint
was
sufficient,
in
other
words,
whether
the
complaint
was
sufficient
and
whether
it
was
probable
cause
from
which
the
united
states
commissioner
could
file
that
the
complaint
was
sufficient
in
order
to
toll
the
statute.
our
position
of
course
is
that
the
complaint
was
not
sufficient
that
it
did
not
allege
sufficient
facts,
that
all
it
alleged
were
--
were
many
conclusions
and
that
it
was
vague
and
definite
and
uncertain
and
alleged
conclusions
and
all
that
--
and
that
it
did
not
give
any
basis
on
which
the
united
states
commissioner
could
make
a
finding
of
probable
cause.
and
for
that
reason
we
contend
that
the
complaint
was
not
valid
and
therefore
the
statute
of
limitations
barred
the
prosecution
for
1956.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
if
the
complaint
had
been
definite
and
the
--
and
the
--
would
have
been
--
and
there
would
have
been
sufficient
facts
alleged
from
which
a
commissioner
could
have
found
probable
cause
then
under
all
the
adjudicated
cases,
we
would
have
to
hope
--
we
would
have
to
concede
that
the
--
that
the
--
that
the
statute
that
was
--
that
the
action
was
not
outlawed
and
that
the
prosecution
could
proceed.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
i
--
it
is
not
amendable
and
in
either
event
that
wasn't
amended.
and
that
it
is
not
amendable
and
the
defendant
was
--
the
appellant
was
not
given
a
hearing
which
could
become
pertinent
under
question
because
under
certain
circumstances
a
complaint
could
be
filed
where
a
person
is
taken
immediately
before
--
before
a
magistrate
or
the
united
states
commissioner
and
given
a
hearing
and
on
those
situations
so
there
are
all
five
that
may
well
be
that
the
complaint
does
not
have
to
allege
--
does
not
have
to
allege
a
probable
cause
because
the
commissioner
immediately
makes
the
finding
of
probable
cause.
but
that
was
not
on
in
this
case.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
no.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
no.
whether
this
complaint
was
--
whether
this
complaint
was
sufficient
to
toll
the
statute,
my
question
is
not
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i'm
sorry
if
i
--
i
didn't
state
that
properly.
now
the
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes
sir.
we
challenge
the
sufficiency
on
two
different
occasions.
we
filed
the
motions
and
we
had
a
hearing
on
the
motion
and
the
judge
overruled
us
and
thereafter
before
the
trial
the
--
the
ninth
circuit
rendered
a
decision
of
the
greenberg
case
holding
a
complaint
of
the
exact
nature
--
or
the
exact
complaint
in
every
way
if
it's
considered
by
the
government
that's
to
same
--
to
same
type
of
complaint.
it's
the
form
that
the
government
uses
and
they
held
that
insufficient
so
we
filed
a
motion
for
reconsideration
and
the
judge
overruled
that
motion.
then
we
sought
a
stay
in
the
eighth
circuit
and
the
court
denied
the
stay
and
have
to
be
pleaded
nolo
contendere
of
the
appeal
of
the
eighth
circuit
and
we
lost
on
the
eight
circuit
and
then
we're
up
here
because
certiorari
was
granted.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that
is
correct.
our
plea
of
nolo
contendere
was
based
to
the
indictment,
to
the
count
one
of
the
indictment.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
no
sir.
to
the
indictment
and
it
was
based
to
the
indictment
which
was
returned
two
months
and
a
month
and
two
days
after
the
statute
had
run.
now,
it
is
significant
that
i
might
point
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
no.
they
could
not
because
it
was
--
it's
a
felony
and
then
lastly
the
defendant
--
the
appellant
waived
the
presentment
by
indictment,
they
could
not
proceed.
they
would
have
had
to
present
the
matter
to
the
grand
jury.
on
misdemeanors
of
course
they
can
but
this
was
a
felony.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well,
if
--
the
information
could
not
--
they
could
not
receive
unless
the
defendant
agree
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
or
unless
you
waived
and
if
the
appellant
had
waived
and
agreed
to
proceed
that
way
they
could
have
but
it
couldn't
otherwise.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
there
was
no
hearing
before
the
commissioner.
so
he
would
have
been
represented
where
the
government
requested
to
continue
and
search
and
that
request
did
no
further
action.
in
other
words,
the
appellant
never
asked
for
a
continuance
or
an
extension
before
the
commission.
the
government
did
that
and
because
there
was
never
any
intent
of
course
and
they
concede
that.
there
was
never
any
intent
to
hold
the
hearing
that
a
complaint
was
filed
primarily
and
specifically
under
section
6531
which
provides
that
upon
the
filing
of
a
complaint
that
the
statute
is
tolled
for
six
--
for
nine
months.
in
other
words
if
within
nine
months
an
indictment
is
returned
then
it
can
be
considered
that
it
is
within
time.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well,
it
is
not
questioned
in
this
--
this
time.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that
is
not
questioned
in
this
case.
perhaps
they
should
have
or
they
didn't.
they
agreed
to
--
to
narrow
all
issues
down
at
the
time
actually
when
we
entered
a
plea
of
nolo
contendere.
we
advise
the
court
that
the
time
we
entered
the
plea
of
nolo
contendere,
and
we
thought
that
this
is
a
broad
count
and
that
this
is
brought
by
the
statute
of
limitations
and
it's
in
the
record
--
and
that
was
all
understood
by
the
government
as
well
as
by
the
court
that
decided
that
the
field
would
be
taken
to
raise
this
point
and
to
have
this
point
adjudicated.
now,
since
the
--
up
until
that
time
and
during
the
trial
and
the
argument
of
the
--
the
eastern
case
in
the
eight
circuit
and
then
all
the
other
cases
even
where
they
held
against
us
--
against
the
appellants,
the
government
had
always
conceded
and
treated
this
matter
as
though
the
complaint
had
to
state
probable
cause.
they
haven't
stated
facts
for
which
the
commissioner
could
make
a
finding
of
probable
cause.
for
the
first
time,
after
we
filed
our
brief,
after
certiorari
was
granted
and
after
we
filed
our
brief,
the
government
raises
the
question
and
they
contend
that
a
complaint
in
this
case,
that
the
complaint
under
section
6531
does
not
have
to
allege
facts
for
which
a
finding
of
probable
cause
could
be
made
by
the
commissioner.
this
is
the
first
time
that
this
question
that
that
approach
was
ever
taken
by
the
justice
department.
we
have
searched
and
we
are
familiar,
i
believe,
of
all
the
cases
that
were
--
that
were
argued
either
appellant
cases
or
district
court
cases
and
we
find
no
time,
at
no
time
was
that
position
taken
by
the
government.
now,
so
therefore
now
in
their
brief
they
contend
that
that
it's
not
necessary.
that
the
complaint
alleged
facts
from
which
the
commissioner
has
to
make
a
finding
of
probable
cause
and
on
the
basis
of
that
issue
is
summon
for
a
warrant.
now,
we
contend
of
course,
that
the
government
is
erroneous
in
that
contention.
we
contend
that
a
complaint
could
only
mean
that
which
has
historically
meant
a
cmplaint
that
the
most
allege
facts
so
--
which
are
sufficient
for
which
a
finding
of
probable
cause
can
be
made
and
the
government
in
their
own
brief
that
was
filed
here
on
page
29,
footnote
15,
they
alleged
that
the
complaint
was
tailored,
in
other
words,
it's
a
form.
and
they
said
that
the
form
was
--
was
corrected
and
so
modified
in
order
to
comply
with
this
court's
decision
on
the
giordenello
case.
in
other
words,
so
they
admit
even
in
their
brief
here
that
--
that
the
complaint
was
so
modified.
it's
a
form
that
they
used.
but
the
form
was
modified
wherein
the
lightest
personal
knowledge
of
the
agent.
and
that
is
set
out
in
there.
we
say
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
probable
cause
that
an
offense
was
committed
and
that
the
defendant
is
probably
the
person
that
committed
the
offense.
and
in
other
words
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that
is
correct.
yes
sir.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
we're
not
talking
about
a
search,
no.
probable
cause
under
the
fourth
amendment,
that
is
correct
--
upon
the
rules
3
and
4
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that's
right.
and
i
might
while
you're
covering
this
if
i
may
to
just
point
out
that
even
though
they
don't
necessarily
proceed
with
an
arrest,
they
proceed
with
the
summons.
the
fact
that
they
raise
that
a
summon
has
the
same
effect
of
an
arrest
because
it
doesn't
comply
with
--
it
comes
in
with
the
summons.in
this
instance
they
asked
that
the
summons
be
issued
and
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
i
don't
think
it
would
make
any
difference.
i
think
that
we
have
to
look
at
it
on
what
that
congress
intend
to
do.
that's
really
the
real
question.
how
could
we
concede
that
congress
intended
to
--
if
they
just
wanted
to
extend
the
statute
of
limitations
without
a
showing
of
probable
cause
at
all
that
all
they
would
have
done
is
given
the
justice
department
an
additional
nine
months
within
which
to
file
--
within
which
to
file
a
proceeding.
now,
they
didn't
do
that.
they
said
that
the
statute
can
be
tolled
for
nine
months
only
if
a
complaint
is
filed.
now,
you
have
to
take
the
word
complaint
at
its
historical
sense
and
in
the
sense
in
which
it
is
interpreted
in
the
light
of
rules
3
and
4
of
the
federal
rules.
and
when
you
take
that
and
a
complaint
means
that
there
must
be
sufficient
facts
alleged
on
which
probable
cause
can
be
found.
if
not
why
a
commissioner
--
why
a
united
states
commissioner
at
all?
is
he
just
going
to
be
a
rubber
stamp
or
is
he
going
to
perform
the
duties
that
this
court
laid
down
in
the
giordenello
case
as
to
what
a
commissioner
or
a
magistrate
has
to
do
in
order
--
in
order
to
make
a
finding
before
they
can
issue
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
or
a
summons.
now,
we
contend
further
that
the
government
states
here
that
the
reason
for
the
extra
nine
months
is
not
to
give
them
a
chance
to
make
further
investigations
but
because
income
tax
cases
are
complicated
and
that
often
the
government,
the
defendant
wants
conferences
before
the
justice
department
and
--
or
deprived
to
the
justice
department
before
the
chief
counsel
of
the
bureau
and
the
appellant's
actions
therefore
they
--
additional
and
sometimes
the
jury
is
not
in
session
and
therefore
additional
time
is
given
to
government
within
which
to
com
--
within
which
to
process
their
case
in
order
to
give
them
a
chance.
but
they
do
not
at
anytime
contend
that
the
additional
time
was
given
in
order
to
make
further
investigations.
now,
if
that
is
so,
how
could
the
government
be
heard?
why
--
then
there
was
a
real
intent
and
purpose
than
it
was
hat
they
should
have
their
case
ready
and
they
should
be
able
to
allege
sufficient
facts
from
which
probable
cause
could
be
--
could
be
determined.
the
government
further
contends
in
their
--
in
their
brief
that
well
after
all
you
treat
a
tax
case
different
than
you
treat
any
other
case
because
in
a
tax
case
the
agent
themselves
first
makes
the
investigation
then
he
writes
a
report
and
this
is
all
extraneous
by
the
way.
but
that's
not
--
but
they'd
still
perfectly
wanted
to
argue
that
point
because
there
it
is
in
their
brief
that
the
agent
makes
a
report
to
the
--
to
his
superior
and
the
superior
makes
a
report
to
the
chief
counsel
and
the
chief
counsel
to
the
justice
department
and
the
justice
department
passes
on
it
then
send
it
to
the
united
states
district
judge
attorney,
the
united
states
attorney
then
the
united
states
attorney
presents
it
to
the
--
presents
it
to
the
grand
jury
for
indictment.
all
that
that
be
that
as
it
may.
the
fact
still
remains.
if
congress
wanted,
the
justice
department
to
make
a
determination
all
they
could
have
said
that
the
justice
department
by
a
letter
by
any
other
indication
could
say,
we
want
an
additional
nine
months.
or
that
they're
taking
additional
nine
months.
the
fact
remains
that
congress
did
not
do
so.
that
congress
provided
that
the
only
way
you
could
toll
the
running
of
the
statute
is
by
filing
a
complaint
with
the
commissioner
and
having
said
so,
a
complaint
has
its
historic
meaning
and
it
must
be
interpreted
within
the
rules
of
three
and
four
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
and
you
must
show
probable
cause.
now,
the
question
then
would
also
be
this
if
--
if
it
was
done
--
if
it
was
done
any
other
way
then
there
would
be
really
no
useless
purpose
and
nothing
would
be
performed
by
the
commissioner.
and
there
would
even
be
a
question
how
he
could
issue
a
summons
which
he
did
in
this
case.
now,
what
basis
would
he
issue
a
summons
if
he
could
not
make
a
finding
of
probable
cause?
the
fact
remains
that
all
the
adjudicated
cases
and
all
the
treatment
by
the
justice
department
considered
that
there
must
be
a
probable
cause.
now,
we
contend
that
this
--
this
affidavit
is
just
a
form
of
affidavit.
this
complaint
rather
which
is
i
gather
with
an
affidavit
is
a
--
is
a
form
which
was
used
and
is
used
in
every
case.
and
it
is
filled
in.
and
if
you
--
if
you
take
--
if
you
examine,
it
is
it
fielded
all
of
the
information
that
it
contains
as
far
as
filling
in
by
the
agent.
the
blanks
that
were
filled
in
were
gotten
or
could
have
been
gotten
from
the
tax
return
of
the
appellant
that
cites
one
figure
and
that
one
figure
is
the
amount
of
the
income
he
should
have
reported.
and
it
is
well
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
amount
of
the
income
that
a
person
should
have
been
reported
that
it
is
alleged
in
an
indictment
is
not
binding
on
the
government
at
all.
in
other
words,
it's
not
well-established,
that
the
government
does
not
have
to
prove
in
an
income
tax
case
the
exact
amount
of
the
charge
of
the
deficiency.
they
do
not
have
to
or
they
are
not
bound
by
their
allegation
or
contention
of
the
indictment.
all
they
have
to
show
is
a
substantial
understatement.
so
really
that
figure
could
be
any
figure
because
it
does
not
need
any
facts
to
substantiate
it.
and
that
really
what
the
complaint
shows
that
there
are
no
facts
alleged
at
all.
not
a
single
fact
is
alleged
in
there
to
show
as
to
what
the
--
what
the
--
what
the
--
on
which
the
commissioner
could
make
a
finding.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes
sir.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes
sir.
and
it
did
so
issue
a
summons
here
(voice
overlap)
because
the
statute
permits
the
u.s.
attorney
to
--
that
their
warrant
shall
be
issued
or
that
the
request
of
the
united
states
attorney
a
summons
shall
issue.
and
at
this
instance
the
summons
was
issued
and
it
was
served
by
the
united
states
martial
on
the
15th
day
of
april
1963,
the
same
day
that
a
complaint
was
filed.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well,
i
would
say
this.
it
would
be
perhaps
there
would
be
a
way
to
--
to
conceive
of
a
form
that
would
fit
all
purposes
whether
if
you
use
a
form,
whether
a
person
the
agent
that
makes
the
complaint,
that
files
the
complaint
must
make
those
allegations
on
personal
knowledge
on
something
that
he
did
and
then
frankly
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
a
form.
for
instance
if
here
the
form
says
that
he
talked
--
he
talked
to
people
that
had
business
with
the
appellant
that
he
examined
books
and
records
of
businesses
of
the
appellant,
that
he
examined
public
records
and
private
records.
but
they're
silent
completely
to
say
where
he
sold
those
records,
what
the
records
say,
what
facts
were
contained
in
those
records.
what
basis
he
is
using
for
to
conceive
that
the
records
are
fraudulent
than
they
are.
there
isn't
one
that
had
filled
us
out
on
that.
so
when
i
say
the
use
of
a
form,
in
itself
there
is
nothing
wrong
if
the
form
can
fit.
but
here
an
agent
is
just
signing
a
form,
and
it
was
quite
obvious
from
the
time
that
we
examined
them
at
the
--
in
support
of
the
motion
that
he
hardly
read
the
form.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes
sir.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that
is
correct.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes
sir.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
the
government
--
he
has
written
a
letter
which
is
in
the
record.
he
has
written
a
letter
that
the
hearing
was
continued
on
the
request
of
the
united
states
attorney.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well,
i
don't
know
whether
he
objected
or
not
but
it
was
continued
anyway.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
and
then
it
was
continued
again
at
the
request
of
the
united
states
attorney.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
i
understand
that
he
did
request
for
a
hearing,
yes
sir.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well,
a
--
he
never
saw
the
affidavit.
the
first
time
he
attacked
the
affidavit
was
because
within
--
within
four
weeks
and
two
days,
he
was
indicted
and
of
course
he
immediately,
within
due
time,
filed
motions
to
dismiss.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
it
is
my
opinion
and
i'll
have
to
confess
i
didn't
direct
myself
to
that
point
exactly.
but
it
is
my
opinion
that
you
cannot
amend
a
complaint
if
--
abinitio.
it
did
not
alleged
sufficient
facts
when
it
deals
with
tolling
the
statute
just
like
you
cannot
have
an
indictment
that
is
deficient
and
doesn't
state
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well,
if
they
didn't
deal
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
i
would
assume
that
--
i
would
assume
that
it
could
have
been
amended
if
it
was
within
the
statutory
period
because
all
the
effect
would
be
is
this
filing
a
new
complaint.
but
i
don't
think
you
could
amend
that
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
no.
no
because
the
statute
rolled
the
day
they
filed
it.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
six
years,
yes
sir.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
the
original.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
the
original.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that's
right.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
but
the
day
after
it
was
too
late.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
nine
months.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
no
sir,
nine
months.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
what
we
said
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that's
right.
but
we
say
that
the
filing
of
a
complaint,
that
a
complaint
must
have
some
substance
to
it
and
not
merely
be
a
piece
of
paper.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well,
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
all
the
complaint
really
said
and
it's
the
same
complaint
that
the
ninth
circuit
had
in
the
greenberg
case
where
it
held
--
where
it
held
in
the
greenberg
case
that
it
was
not
sufficient.
all
it
pleaded
was
conclusions.
it
gave
no
facts.
in
other
words,
we
think
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
no,
no,
no.
no.
i
would
say
this
that
what
you
need
is
enough
facts
alleged
from
which
a
united
states
commissioner
can
lead
the
complaint
and
make
a
--
an
affirmative
finding
of
probable
cause
because
he
has
to
make
that
finding
because
the
commissioner's
action
is
reviewable.
now,
if
he
cannot,
by
leaving
the
complaint
if
it
doesn't
alleged
any
facts
and
you
will
read
that
complaint
carefully,
you
will
find
it
does
not
allege
a
single
fact.
all
it
alleges
is
if
he
looks
on
books
and
records.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
no,
he
doesn't
even
say
he
took
the
money.
it
doesn't
even
say
that
just
using
as
an
example.
he
doesn't
say
that
the
book
showed
--
the
book
showed
that
he
--
that
he
recorded
$30.00
but
it
took
in
$230.00.
he
doesn't
give
a
single
fact,
not
one
fact
is
given
in
this
and
that
it
gives
generalities,
it
says
he
looks
at
that
books
or
records
that
he
talk
with
people.
he
doesn't
say
what
the
people
said,
he
doesn't
say
who
they
work,
he
doesn't
makes
one
accusatory
statement
except
that
he
himself
says
that
it
was
personal
knowledge
or
personal
belief
that
there
was
a
violation
and
there
was
a
false
return
filed.
that's
the
significant
part
of
it.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
or
does
he
say
who
we
talked
with
even
one,
does
he
say
what
they
--
what
they
have
said?
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well
he's
got
to
say
something
if
not
--
if
not
it's
a
man
looking
in
his
own
pocket
and
say
“i
got
such
and
such”,
where
the
commissioner
can't
say
that
it's
in
there.
we
don't
know
who
he
talked
to.
he
don't
--
now
how
can
the
commissioner
say
from
that
whether
he
--
whether
the
agent
drew
the
proper
conclusion.
he
can't
say
it
because
he
doesn't
say
what
the
facts
were.
if
there
were
any
facts,
if
they're
given,
i
don't
say
i
have
to
give
all
the
facts.
if
they've
given
any
facts
at
all
whether
they
gave
no
facts
at
all
in
this
instance,
and
by
the
failure
to
give
the
facts,
by
a
failure
to
give
any
facts
at
all,
the
commissioner
cannot
make
a
finding.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that's
right.
but
he
doesn't
say
whether
books
were
deficient.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
right.
but
it
doesn't
say
what
any
of
them
said.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well,
he
did
that
or
at
least
say
--
i
--
i
would
even
buy
this.
if
he
would
have
said,
if
he
would
have
said,
your
honor,
that
he
would
have
said,
now
so
and
so
said
that
he
told
me
to
give
me
cash,
or
--
or
not
naming
the
name
who
say
that
they
told
me
to
give
him
cash
that
he
or
that
he
would
make
no
record.
any
kind
of
a
thing
to
make
some
factual
determination,
i
mean
from
which
a
commissioner
can
say
“well
this
looks
to
me
that
there's
probable
cause,”
there
he
gave
nothing.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
alright,
now
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that
--
that's
right
he
did.
now
but
when
he
says
in
the
first
place
the
mere
understatement
of
income
is
not
an
offense.
they're
mostly
out
of
factors
as
the
court
well
knows
in
order
to
show
fraud.
you're
better
familiar
with
those
cases
than
i.
and
the
fact
still
remains
that
there
isn't
any
allegation.
he
just
makes
that
naked
statement
based
on
nothing.
now,
what
has
the
commissioner
supposed
to
do?
he
might
have
just
as
well
not
said
that
he
looked
at
the
books,
now
that
is
because
he
doesn't
give
any
facts.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
i
only
have
i
believe
about
one
or
two
minutes
that
i
may
call
the
court's
attention
just
one
--
this
question
about
the
allegation
that
it
contains
the
formal
charge
the
same
as
an
indictment.
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
an
indictment
is
returned
after
there
is
evidence
heard
by
the
grand
jury.
and
the
grand
jury
does
have
--
makes
a
finding
of
probable
cause.
so
this
is
different
than
a
complaint
when
it
comes
to
a
commissioner
on
which
he
has
nothing
to
base
on.
the
second
thing
this
i
would
point
what
they're
--
what
they're
talking
about
that
the
protection
that
is
given
that
a
various
care
for
the
departments
to
review
it,
of
course
this
is
almost
like
saying
that
he
is
guilty
because
he
is
here.
in
other
words
the
mere
fact
that
a
complaint
has
filed,
you
don't
have
to
allege
anything
because
if
the
government
says
that
he
committed
the
offense,
that's
it.
we
submit
that
under
the
circumstances
in
there
that
it's
just
isn't
anything
in
there
on
which
to
bottom
this
--
this
indictment.
i
want
to
point
out
also
that
rule
3
applied
on
that
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well
i
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
i
kind
of
think
you
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
i
kind
of
think
the
giordenello
affidavit
is
stronger
than
this
affidavit.
now,
this
is
a
matter
of
opinion
and
because
i
think
here
that's
so
vague
and
it
talks
about
books.
i'm
talking
about
the
person
but
not
one
single
effect
is
--
is
given
on
which
it
can
be
predicated.
i
do
disagree
with
mr.
lewin
completely
when
he
says
that
they
would
have
to
give
the
case
away.
and
all
that
was
noted
that
many
cases
the
government
filed
affidavit
and
just
give
a
scintilla
of
the
evidence
and
then
when
they
come
into
trial,
they
have
considerably
more
evidence
and
that's
--
that
that's
the
way
it
is.
if
they
could
just
give
enough
evidence
on
which
a
commissioner
could
make
a
finding.
now,
rule
3
provides
that
--
that
it
shall
be
made
that
the
complaint
shall
be
written
and
so
forth
and
it
should
be
made
upon
oath
before
the
commissioner
or
other
officer
empowered
to
commit
persons
charged
of
that
offense
against
the
united
states
and
i
would
even
then
contemplate
that
this
is
a
proceeding
where
either
you
have
to
read
the
conjunction
of
rule
4
that
you
read
an
issue
an
order
for
the
arrest,
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
and
if
it
is
a
request
to
the
united
states
attorney
it's
a
summons.
and
of
course
the
summons,
i
do
not
distinguish
between
a
summons
or
an
arrest
because
you
are
under
arrest.
you're
commanded
to
do
something
and
if
you
don't
obey
it,
then
you're
under
arrest
thank
you
very
much.
