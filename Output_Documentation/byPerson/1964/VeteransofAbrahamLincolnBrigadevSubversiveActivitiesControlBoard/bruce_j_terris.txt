mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
answer
a
couple
of
questions
that
came
up
at
the
end
of
the
morning's
argument.
mr.
justice
brennan's
to
aid
and
support
evidence,
that's
detailed
at
some
length
at
pages
40
to
46
of
our
brief.
now
--
and
then
in
addition
it
refers
back
to
some
more
material
a
few
pages
earlier.
let
me
just
summarize
it,
it
is
not
that
petitioner
was
antifascist.
it's
the
petitioner
who
followed
the
program
of
the
communist
party
which
the
communist
party
labels
as
its
antifascist
program.
in
fact,
it's
very
instructive
to
look
a
petitioner's
policies
during
the
period
first
before
the
soviet-hitler
pact,
then
after
the
pact
and
then
after
the
invasion
of
the
soviet
union
by
hitler.
they
switched,
the
petitioner
switched
exactly
at
the
same
and
in
the
same
way
that
the
communist
party
switched,
the
same
kind
of
evidence
that
was
in
the
communist
party
case.
in
other
words,
there
are
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
46,
and
then
it
refers
back
to
this
kind
of
material
few
pages
earlier
but
it
gives
a
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
40
to
46,
that's
right.
also
the
petitioner
oppose
things
like
the
marshall
plan,
the
truman
doctrine,
they're
not
exactly
things
that
--
it
would
be
hard,
you
have
to
press
pretty
hard
to
consider
them
as
just
normal
antifascism.
although
they
are
part
of
the
antifascism
doctrine,
the
way
the
communist
party
interprets
it.
now
other
things
that
petitioner
did
and
the
evidence
shows
that
it
was
recruiting
ground
for
party
members
that
supported
all
kinds
of
party
activities,
rallies,
picketing,
subscription
drives
for
the
daily
worker,
things
of
that
kind.
it
did
it
--
and
this
is
all
described
and
summarized
on
pages
40
to
46.
now,
as
to
the
pre-1950
evidence
and
the
post-1950
evidence,
the
government's
basic
theory
--
i
am
not
going
to
go
into
the
--
the
exact
specification
of
what
was
pre
and
what
was
post.
mr.
chief
justice
we
describe
that
post-1950
evidence
starting
at
the
bottom
of
page
59
and
to
the
top
of
page
60
there
is
not
a
great
deal
of
it.
there
is
we
think
enough
to
do
one
thing,
it's
our
view
that
we
--
that
the
government
established
that
the
communist
party
controlled
petitioner
and
the
petitioner
operated
for
the
purpose
of
aiding
and
supporting
for
the
primary
purpose
of
aiding
and
supporting
the
communist
party
by
overwhelming
evidence
in
the
period
up
to
1950.
we
do
not
say
the
evidence
after
1950
would
come
close
to
establishing
either
with
those
facts
alone.
what
we
say
is
the
evidence
is
sufficient
to
show
that
the
character
of
petitioner
did
not
change.
now,
let
me
compare
that
--
let
me
compare
this
case
to
the
communist
party
case
on
the
same
point.
in
the
communist
party
case,
there
was
extremely
little
government
evidence
after
1950,
very
little.
in
fact,
there
was
not
much
government
evidence
after
1940.
there
was
enough
to
establish
that
character
of
the
communist
party
continued
as
prior
to
1940.
the
large
majority
that
government
evidence
was
before
1940.
this
court
specifically
considered
the
same
proposition
the
petitioner
now
advances.
it
rejected
it.
we
think
that
the
same
result
follows
in
this
case.
i
may
say
that
we
don't
look
to
1964
back
to
1950.
we
looked
from
1954
back,
because
it
was
in
1954
the
hearing
took
place
and
the
fact
that
these
proceedings
seemed
to
stretch
on
interminably
as
it
was
also
true
of
course
in
the
communist
party
case,
going
to
hardly
mean
that
government
has
got
to
have
shown
evidence
more
recent
than
it
would
at
the
first
time,
otherwise
we
never
stop
the
case.
we
have
to
have
another
hearing
and
by
the
time
that
got
up
to
this
court,
we
probably
--
that
would
be
staled
too.
so
that
we
have
to
look
at
it
from
1954
and
evidence
in
the
late
40's
for
example
certainly
isn't
very
stale
looking
from
1954.
now,
it
looks
like
it's
another
era.
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
communist
party
case
the
government
did
not
prove
that
the
communist
party
have
done
anything
illegal.
the
government
did
show
that
in
dennis
and
as
to
--
as
to
an
individual,
in
scales.
we
did
not
show
it
in
the
communist
party
case,
we
did
show
that
the
communist
party
advocated
overthrow
of
the
government.
we
did
not
show
enough
to
meet
the
aid
standard,
that
proposition
was
specifically
argued
to
this
court
that
we
have
not
met
the
aid
standard.
it
was
rejected
by
this
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
pardon
me.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
quite
right,
that's
exactly
--
that
is
of
course
exactly
what
we
argued
to
this
court
and
this
court
accepted,
that
yates
and
scales
and
dennis
that
those
cases
do
not
set
the
standard.
we're
not
--
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
we
need
not
show
criminal
illegality
in
order
to
require
an
organization
to
register.
the
communist
party
case
establishes
that.
we
don't
have
to
show
the
petitioners
engaged
in
illegal
activity
we
say
in
order
that
it
register.
now
i'd
like
to
divide
up
the
constitutional
question
into
two
parts,
we
think
there
are
two
issues
before
the
court.
the
first
issue
is
whether
petitioner,
whether
the
board
has
the
power
to
make
a
finding
whether
petitioner
is
a
communist-front
within
the
meeting
of
the
statute,
thing
else
of
finding
and
determination.
and
the
second
and
we
think
separate
proposition
is
whether
congress
upon
a
finding
of
the
board
can
require
registration
and
the
limited
disclosure
which
the
act
requires.
now
as
--
and
we
think
these
are
two
separate
propositions,
i
won't
go
into
detail,
but
the
congress
intended
them
to
be
separate.
it
considered
the
mere
finding
the
publicity
of
what
these
organizations
were
like
to
be
extremely
important.
in
fact
one
of
the
main
themes
in
congress
was
that
was
unfair
to
organizations,
to
have
the
attorney
general
as
he
was
then
doing,
labeling
an
organization
as
a
communist-front,
putting
on
a
list
without
giving
full
procedures,
this
was
one
of
the
crucial
arguments
for
the
act
as
far
as
it
applied
to
communist-fronts.
and
therefore
the
act
provided
full
hearings,
full
procedural
administrative
guarantees,
coupled
with
judicial
review.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
department
of
justice.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
your
honor,
and
then
of
course,
as
a
broad
severability
clause
and
other
indications
such
as
to
the
fact
that
for
communist
--
communist-infiltrated
organizations,
which
is
not
before
the
court
here.
all
that
congress
required,
al
that
it
required
was
a
finding
by
the
board.
no
registrations,
no
disclosure.
now
some
of
the
disabilities
did
apply
but
as
far
as
the
issue
now
before
the
court,
it
doesn't
--
it
did
not
require
registration
to
disclosure.
a
pure
finding
was
all
that
congress
provided
for
and
so
we
think
it's
clear
that
congress
considered
the
findings
alone
important.
and
therefore
we
think
the
constitutional
issue
have
to
be
considered
separately.
now,
of
course
as
to
the
findings,
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
question
whatsoever,
did
not
even
asked
to
do
anything.
it's
a
pure
governmental
finding
based
on
what
we
believe
to
be
fair
procedures.
now,
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
findings,
we
think
that
this
court
has
never
held
or
even
suggested
that
the
government
cannot
make
a
determination
about
an
organization
on
the
basis
of
fair
procedures.
and
we
think
it
certainly
can
do
so
about
an
organization
concerning
which
the
evidence
shows
is
controlled
by
an
organization,
it
works
for
an
organization,
which
in
turn
is
controlled
by
and
works
for
an
organization
controlled
by
a
foreign
government.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
do
assume
that
your
honor
that
it
isn't
--
i
don't
think
there
be
any
doubt
that
there
was
a
governmental
purpose
here.
the
purpose
of
the
government
was
to
show
that
some
organizations
which
reported
to
be
non-communist
were
in
fact
subsidiaries
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
were
talking
--
let's
assume
that
--
let's
assume
that
there
was
a
problem
in
a
certain
area
about
charities.
many
people
who
gave
money
to
charities
didn't
realize
the
charity
used
for
different
purposes,
not
fraud,
but
just
used
it
for
different
purposes
that
people
that
ran
it,
weren't
the
people
that
they
thought.
and
in
the
state
legislature
or
the
congress
said,
“let's
have
disclosure,
what
the
activities
are?
we're
going
to
make
a
determination
of
the
activities.
we'll
make
a
determination,
the
basis
of
fair
procedures
of
the
activities
and
who
runs
these
organizations?”
i
don't
think
there
can
be
much
doubt
that
congress
would
have
that
power.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
that's
what
i'm
going
to
tell.
let's
talk
about
the
district
of
columbia
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
then
your
honor,
so
we
don't
have
that
problem,
more
state
legislature.
i
don't
think
there'd
be
much
doubt
of
a
power
to
disclose
to
people
enough
information
because
they're
aren't
deceived.
this
is
the
liberate
deception.
that's
what
congress
found.
it's
not
only
the
congress
founded
i
may
point
out.
this
court
approved
these
specific
findings
in
the
communist
party
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
essentially,
that's
right
your
honor.
our
point
is
if
petitioner
makes
much
of
the
fact
that
all
the
doctrine
in
this
court
about
regulation
of
the
communist
party
is
for
the
communist
party
alone,
our
point
is
that
this
in
effect
is
the
communist
party.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
self-crimination
point
that
was
not
decided?
or
what
was
decided
--
and
we
think
its
controlling
as
the
issue
is
premature.
they're
just
as
premature
here.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
our
answer
is
that
--
first
of
all,
the
organization
doesn't
have
a
privilege
that
the
--
therefore
in
order
to
have
any
of
its
officers
have
a
privilege
for
the
organization's
records
and
that
we
think
alone
is
sufficient
because
what
in
essence
is
asked
for
is
the
organization's
records.
i
think
that's
probably
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
any
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
boudin
can
sign
the
paper.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he's
not
going
incriminate
himself.
mr.
boudin
can
sign
the
paper.
just
to
this
he
can
get
up
in
this
court
and
represent
the
veterans
without.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
your
honor,
that
if
--
if
the
government
is
successful
in
this
case
the
petitioner
is
required
to
register.
then
its
officers
do
not
incriminate
themselves
by
authorizing,
the
government
is
not
asking
for
who
did
the
authorization
but
authorizing
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
mr.
boudin
to
sign
the
paper.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
your
honors,
the
communist
party
could
not
and
petitioner
could
not
in
this
case
refuse
to
authorize
somebody
to
obey
the
statute
because
it
just
doesn't
want
to
and
--
i
don't
really
equate
answer
if
you
don't
understand
the
difficulty.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
if
the
organization
has
the
privilege,
if
the
organization
has
the
privilege,
then
of
course
--
the
quick
answer
is
that
they
can
just
say
no.
that's
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
hope
i
--
let
me
go
back
to
what
i
said
--
there
are
two
parts
of
that.
the
first
thing
is
i
--
i
agree
that
if
a
person
admits
that
he
his
an
officer
of
a
communist-front
although
that
doesn't
get
him
get
anywhere
near
close
to
prosecution
under
the
smith
act,
under
this
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
no,
no.
i
mean
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
that's
what
i'm
going
to
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
could
be
a
lead,
it
could
be
a
lead.
and
--
but
my,
but
the
point
is,
it
may
be
that
they
can't
find
an
agent,
they
can't
find
an
attorney,
how
was
this
court
at
this
point
can
determine
whether
petitioner
can
find
an
attorney
or
find
an
agent.
now
what,
i
think
instructive
to
look
at
the
communist
party
case,
not
in
this
court
but
in
the
court
of
appeals
when
the
communist
party
was
prosecuted,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
conviction
of
the
communist
party.
it
allows
the
government
to
retry
the
communist
party.
this
has
not
yet
occurred.
it
said
contrary
the
government's
position,
if
the
burden
was
on
the
government
to
show
that
there
was
a
volunteer,
an
agent
or
an
attorney,
ready
to
register
the
communist
party.
but
it
said
that
that
was
a
possibility,
a
matter
of
proof.
if
the
government
could
show
it,
then
the
communist
party
had
violated
the
statute
and
the
criminal
penalties
apply
to
it.
in
other
words,
i
don't
see
how
it
can
possibly
be
litigated
at
this
point
whether
mr.
boudin
would
say
no
or
any
--
and
every
other
attorney
that
they
contacted.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
in
a
situation
that
we
don't
have
the
full
amount
of
facts.
in
the
communist
party
case
i
think
shows
the
prematurity,
especially
--
and
i
don't
think
your
honor's
opinion
about
the
fifth
amendment
point
consider
the
possibility
of
the
agent
or
the
attorney.
if
an
officer
had
to
invoke
his
own
privilege,
there
was
the
possibility
that
your
honor
suggested.
but
in
fact
the
regulations
--
i'm
not
sure
whether
they
were
different
then
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
at
the
moment
they
are
absolutely
clear
--
that
they're
absolutely
clear.
i
looked
at
them
just
a
couple
of
days
ago.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
can
file
them
with
the
--
with
the
court
and
we'd
be
happy
to.
now,
i
will
make
with
just
one
more
point.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
my
understanding
is
this.
i
am
going
to
attempt
to
prove
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
what,
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
could
prove.
the
one
point
i
wanted
to
make
was
the
--
is
just
how
controlling
the
communist
party
case
is
--
is
here.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
your
honor.
i'm
talking
--
when
i
say
controlling,
i
mean
the
supreme
court's
determination.
on
pages
109
to
111
of
the
government's
brief,
we
set
out
at
some
length
quotations
from
the
communist
party
decision.
now,
i'd
like
to
just
read
one
sentence
that's
on
page
111,
the
court
said,
“where
the
mask
of
anonymity
which
an
organization's
members
wear
serves
the
double
purpose
of
protecting
them
from
popular
prejudice,
have
enabling
them
to
cover
over
a
foreign-directed
conspiracy,
infiltrate
into
other
groups
and
enlist
the
support
of
persons
who
would
