the
inference
based

would
the

when
there
are
a
lot
of
issues
in
the
congress
that
takes
--
takes
one
side
of

you
tell
us
the
thousands
of
bits
of
evidence
along

yet
one
thing
in

now
wait
a
minute,
does
that
--
does
that
in

constitute
any
evidence
of
control?
the
fact
that
they
--
chief

earl
warren
that
they
favored
defendants
who
are
charged
under
the
smith
