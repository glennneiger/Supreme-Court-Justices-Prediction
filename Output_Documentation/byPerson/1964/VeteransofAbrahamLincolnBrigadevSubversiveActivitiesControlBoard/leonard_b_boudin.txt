mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
members
of
the
court.
this
case
too
as
your
honor
know
--
as
your
honors
know,
is
a
proceeding
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
district
of
columbia
by
a
two
to
one
vote.
judge
bazelon
dissenting
upholding
an
order
of
the
subversive
activities
control
board
that
the
petitioner,
the
veterans
of
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade
registers
as
a
communist-front
organization.
the
petitioner
consists
of
surviving
members
of
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade,
americans
who
went
to
spain
in
1936
to
fight
on
the
republican's
side
in
the
civil
war.
and
while
the
court
below
makes
some
reference
to
the
fact
that
it
thought
from
historical
analysis
that
this
was
a
war
between
communism
and
fascism,
i
don't
think
that
view
can
fairly
be
attributed
though
the
court
intend
to
attribute
it
to
the
people
who
went,
whether
those
who
lived
or
those
who
didn't
live.
and
i
think
if
history
is
to
be
the
test
of
this
case,
we
trust
it
is
not
because
we
don't
believe
that
the
veterans
of
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade
where
the
spanish
civil
war
is
on
trial,
but
the
post-1950
organization
is
on
trial
here,
then
i
think
we
prefer
to
refer
to
the
history
which
is
set
forth
in
the
works
of
harold
ickes,
and
samuel
wells,
and
jonathan
daniels
and
the
others
who
evaluated
the
spanish
civil
war
as
a
war
of
democracy
against
fascism.
thus,
i
say,
i
haven't
argue
this
although
the
board
and
its
report
devotes
most
of
its
time
to
the
spanish
civil
war
and
to
its
significance,
and
the
government
also
played
great
reliance
about
what
happened
in
1936,
1938
and
most
important
to
the
government,
what
happened
in
1939
at
the
time
of
the
soviet-nazi
pact
when
the
petitioner
was
only
in
the
process
of
formation
and
certainly
many,
many
years
before
the
statutory
period
is
relevant
here,
1950
to
1955
went
into
effect.
i
may
say
that
the
court
below
is
very
critical
of
the
board
and
your
honors
will
read
with
great
interest
the
elaborate
discussion
by
judge
prettyman
saying
that
we
are
not
concerned
about
the
past,
we
are
concerned
about
the
period
1950
to
1955.
and
your
honorable
--
honors
will
say
that
judge
prettyman
was
also
very
critical
of
the
board
because
his
view
of
the
meaning
of
the
control
concept
which
i'll
discuss
in
a
moment
was
radically
different
from
of
the
board.
the
fact
that
he
came
to
a
conclusion
after
much
worrying
about
it,
conclusion
on
the
side
of
the
government
does
not
diminish
the
fact
that
he
disagreed
radically
with
the
board's
views.
now,
the
issue
in
this
case
as
we
see
it
is
whether
or
not
bearing
in
mind
the
very
strict
preponderance
of
evidence
rule
laid
down
by
this
statute
in
contradistinction
to
this
substantial
evident
rule
and
other
administrative
agency
cases.
bearing
that
rule
in
mind
has
the
government
made
out
either
he
deny
that,
the
control
component
or
the
aid
or
objective
component
as
it
is
shown.
and
in
considering
whether
the
government
has
made
out
those
two
elements
i
will
say
elements
of
the
crime,
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
in
the
construction
of
the
statute,
the
constitutional
consideration,
the
impact
upon
the
admittedly
first
amendment
rights
of
the
petitioner
and
its
members
will
have
to
be
evaluated.
if
you
have
an
ambiguous
statute
in
any
respect,
that
are
on
the
many
of
decisions
of
the
court,
most
familiar
to
me
of
course
kent
against
dulles
decision,
then
the
court
will
construe
the
statute
in
such
away
as
to
give
a
minimum
power
to
the
government
rather
than
a
maximum
one.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
i
think
our
case
is
a
very
clear
one
on
the
facts
because
as
judge
prettyman
said
almost
startling
with
his
words
is
the
fact
that
so
little
of
the
evidence
relate
to
1950
or
a
year
thereafter.
and
it
is
upon
so
little
of
the
evidence
that
the
board's
order
was
predicated
and
judge
prettyman's
opinion
was
written.
now,
what
is
the
evidence
would
respect
to
control
and
how
did
the
board
and
the
court
identified
it,
how
do
they
come
to
the
same
conclusion.
the
court
held
in
contradistinction
to
everything
said
by
the
board
that
in
order
for
the
petitioner
to
be
controlled
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
it
must
not
merely
have
members
of
the
communist
party
in
its
leadership,
fact
which
as
i've
indicated
in
a
moment,
not
have
members
but
have
functionaries
or
representatives
of
the
communist
party.
this
is
i
say
was
in
clear
contradistinction
with
the
whole
pattern
of
the
board's
decision
which
makes
no
different
distinctions
between
representatives,
functionaries,
or
members.
so
we
have
the
basic
principle
laid
down
by
the
court
in
elaborate
language
not
in
the
passing
sentence.
then
we
have
the
agreement
of
the
board,
the
court
and
the
record,
all
three,
that
from
1950
on
when
mr.
fishman,
moe
fishman
became
executive
secretary
of
the
organization,
he
was
the
dominant
manager
of
the
petitioning
organization,
and
we
have
--
secondly,
the
fact
that
he
was
assisted,
assisted
by
a
man
named
milton
wolff
who
had
been
connected
with
the
organization
as
supervisory
capacity
earlier
and
milton
wolff
likewise
according
to
the
court
of
appeals,
as
to
him,
there
was
no
evidence
they
hint
there
was
no
evidence,
no
direct
evidence,
i'll
read
the
words
in
a
few
minutes
as
to
his
being
a
functionary
or
even
member
after
1950
of
the
communist
party.
i
may
say
that
even
as
the
membership,
the
only
evidence
in
this
elaborate
record
and
i
do
think
that
the
court
may
want
to
look
at
the
record
because
of
the
difference
we
have
with
government,
is
that
there
is
testimony
by
mr.
boudin's,
it
might
be
familiar
to
this
court,
that
in
1940,
mr.
wollf
made
an
admission
to
him
that
he
mr.
wolff
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
there
was
testimony
in
1941
or
its
equivalent.
there
is
a
testimony
in
1941
by
a
mr.
yuba
with
respect
to
an
admission
made
by
mr.
fishman,
1940
and
1941,
and
we
are
today
in
1964
to
determine
how
an
ct
should
apply
to
an
organization
based
on
evidence.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
wolff
was
the
second
man
in
charge
of
the
organization.
as
a
matter
fact
i
was
even
wrong,
at
one
testimony,
he
was
a
member.
there
was
a
statement
made
that
he
made
a
report
to
a
meeting
of
the
communist
party
in
1940.
in
other
words
your
honors
not
even
as
to
membership
is
there
are
anything
more
recent
than
1940
and
1941.
now,
we
are
accustomed
and
of
course
there's
nothing
as
to
being
a
functionary
representative,
we're
accustomed
when
we
receive
briefs
from
the
government
to
accept
virtually
anything
as
a
availed
implementer
the
solicitor
general
of
whom
we
have
the
highest
regard
necessarily,
and
i
do
not
attribute
to
him,
misstatements
that
have
made
in
this
brief
as
it
were
in
the
preceding
brief,
with
respect
to
the
alleged
membership
of
the
communist
party
of
mr.
wolff
and
of
mr.
fishman,
your
honors
will
see
at
page
63
of
the
government's
brief.
pardon
me,
at
64
in
talking
about
mr.
fishman,
the
government
says
there
is
however
evidence
or
begins
by
saying
the
evidence
of
mr.
fishman
is
not
as
complete
by
the
understatement.
there
is
however
evidence
of
his
party
membership
during
the
periods
from
1941
--
from
1940
to
1941
and
1947,
and
then
there
are
transcript
references
there.
and
to
possibly
1946,
i'm
reading
the
government's
brief
at
page
64.
now,
i
took
precaution
yesterday
of
going
over
the
transcript
of
the
record
which
i
have
here
and
let
us
see
how
the
government
fixes
membership.
we're
only
talking
about
membership
now
from
1940
to
1947.
a
witness
said
that
he
knew
mr.
fishman
at
some
point
in
the
past
and
he
was
then
asked,
“and
did
you
know
him?
when
did
you
know
him?”
and
he
says,
“oh,
i
don't
remember?”
“well,
what
decade?”
“i
don't
remember.”
“well,
could
it
have
been
between
1940
and
1947?”
as
i
regret
to
say
was
asked
by
the
counsel
for
the
petitioning
organization
here,
whether
between
1940
and
1947,
and
he
said,
“yes,
it
could
have
been,”
and
so
based
upon
this
statement
that
he
might
have
known
mr.
fishman
from
1940
to
1947
the
government
has
fixed
the
period,
the
relevant
date,
at
the
latest
date,
1947
instead
of
saying
that
there
really
is
no
evidence
as
to
precise
time
and
it
could
have
been
40
or
41.
and
when
i
--
and
as
i
say,
your
honors
will
want
to
read
the
pages
that
the
government
cites
here
because
we
are
not
accustomed
to
get
that.
and
this
i
regret
to
say
is
a
cotangent
which
you
get
from
being
too
close
to
the
disease,
the
disease
of
the
board
proceedings.
and
on
page
64,
when
i
notice
a
reference
here
as
a
in
walsh
case,
fishman
is
also
an
activist
in
support
of
a
party
program.
i
looked
at
the
reference
to
that,
i
said,
“what
party
programs
was
mr.
fishman
supporting
before
or
after?”
well,
there
is
mccarran
act
analysis
by
the
national
lawyers
guild
that's
one
page
reference,
is
an
opposition
to
the
arrival
in
the
united
states
of
falangist
or
fascist
mayor
of
madrid.
this
is
what
the
board
has
given
to
the
court
as
fishman
is
also
been
active
in
support
of
party
programs.
now,
i
mentioned
that
because
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
very
delicate
issue,
virtually
the
life
and
death
of
an
organization.
we're
dealing
with
fundamental
issues
and
this
is
not
the
way
for
the
government
to
treat
fundamental
issues
by
not
giving
your
honors
correct
references
to
the
record.
i
don't
want
to
spend
too
much
time
on
that.
i
think
i
already
had
too
much
except
to
ask
your
honors
to
look
at
some
of
these
references.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
my
legal
augment
stands
anyhow,
your
honor.
i
don't
even
care
of
everything
the
government
said
in
their
briefs
were
true.
your
honor
is
quite
right
because
basically
the
court
below
has
found
that
these
then
were
not
functionary
or
a
representative
of
the
communist
party,
none
of
that
the
data
relates
to
post-1950
and
therefore
there
is
no
control
in
the
communist
party
of
this
organization.
now,
there
are
two
things,
however,
that
the
court
below
does
say,
after
stating
that
they
were
not
key
representatives.
one
statement
by
the
court
below
is
that
the
representative
capacity
if
any,
remember
this
is
a
preponderance
of
evidence
case
if
any
of
these
two
must
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
they
made
reports
to
the
politburo
concerning
the
brigade.
it
happens
that
the
court
below
was
wrong,
the
only
reference
to
report
is
the
one
i
mentioned
before
by
mr.
boudin
with
respect
to
1940
and
with
respect
to
mr.
wolff,
hardly,
i
think
proof
of
representative
capacity
in
1950
of
mr.
fishman
or
mr.
wolff,
and
then
the
court
makes
reference
to
a
letter,
a
letter
that
was
showing
by
some
people
of
the
court
thought
might
be
an
executive
board
even
though
there
was
testimony
of
the
executive
board
didn't
operate
from
1949
on
and
mr.
fishman
was
running
this
little
organization,
and
after
that
judge
bazelon
is
adequately
dispose
of
it
and
i
don't
want
to
repeat
it.
i
do
want
to
come
down
for
the
second
element
and
that
is
the
aid
component
because
here
we
have
a
very
adequate
description
or
adoption
by
the
court
of
our
description
of
what
the
organization
did
since
1950.
this
is
what
the
court
below
says
about
the
veterans.
the
brigade
says
in
its
brief
to
us
that
since
the
latter
date,
its
activities
have
consisted
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
pardon
me,
page
18
of
my
brief
quotes
the
records,
“have
consisted
of
social
affairs,
statements
in
opposition
to
the
franco
regime,
the
rehabilitation
of
brigade
members
in
need
of
aid,
support
of
its
members
indicted
under
the
smith
act,
particularly
nelson
and
weissman,
and
defense
of
itself
in
the
instant
proceeding.
the
report
of
the
board
does
not
materially
contradict
this
factual
position,”
i
won't
--
need
not
read
the
rest.
now,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
aid
to
the
communist
party's
objectives
and
purposes
that
were
intended
by
congress.
and
in
addition
to
what
has
been
said
by
mr.
forer
and
some
of
the
suggestions
that
have
been
made
by
the
court,
i
would
like
to
add
the
following.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
principle
of
free
speech
laid
down
in
section
1
(b)
of
the
statute
that
nothing
in
this
statute
be
construed
to
impair
freedom
of
speech.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
discussion
of
communist
party
objectives
set
forth
in
section
2
of
the
act.
and
finally
to
section
13
(f)
(3)
of
the
act
where
it
is
said
that
the
criterion
is
the
extent
to
which
is
funds,
resources,
or
personnel
are
used,
further
or
promote
the
objectives
of
any
communist-action
organization.
now,
i
do
not
think
and
i
don't
want
to
repeat
the
discussion
that
we
had
here
but
i
will
add
something
a
little
different.
do
not
say
how
any
of
the
activities
that
have
been
described
here
including
opposition
to
the
internal
security
act
which
is
the
case
before
us
including
the
defense
in
one
zone
members,
unjustly
as
the
decision
of
this
court
have
held
prosecuted
under
the
smith
act
or
under
the
pennsylvania
sedition
act
and
certainly
the
basic
functions
of
this
organization,
the
rehabilitation
of
the
men
who
came
from
spain
and
were
sick
and
were
ill
and
were
homeless,
those
functions
which
were
the
principal
functions
of
the
organization
and
which
constituted
the
principle
part
of
its
budget
can
hardly
be
said
to
be
of
aid
to
the
communist
party's
objectives.
now,
i've
heard
the
discussion
that
we've
here
of
course
and
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
what
we
have
said
or
rather
what
congress
has
said
in
what
we
reported
at
page
31
of
our
brief.
there,
the
proponents
of
this
legislation
congressman
walter,
senator
mccarran
and
others
emphasized
exactly
the
opposite
arguments
that
that
made
by
mr.
terris
and
in
a
quotation,
it
does
not
appear
in
my
brief
but
appears
on
page
3724
of
the
congressional
record
of
august
29,
1950,
paging
750,
congressman
walter
pointed
out
that
the
basic
objection
of
this
statute
was
i'm
quoting,
“that
its
purpose
was
to
police
and
to
regulate
not
actions
or
conduct
but
thought
and
expression.
i
say
to
you--”
said
congressman
walter,
“--
there
is
nothing
in
the
bill
that
in
any
wise
attempts
to
regulate
thought
or
expression”.
of
course
if
you
take
this
one
section
and
read
the
paragraph
out
it
without
regard
for
the
other
paragraphs
of
this
section,
it
will
indicate
that
this
is
objective.
now,
the
government
has
come
in
with
a
test
of
subjectivity
as
it
is
described
here
or
a
motivation.
again
even
if
the
government
will
write
in
its
construction
of
the
statute
or
adopt
mr.
forer's
use
of
the
word
ulterior
or
whether
we
take
a
different
conception
of
fraud
in,
it
would
make
no
difference.
the
fact
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
the
petitioning
union
was
doing
--
petitioner's
organization
was
doing
anything
to
aid
the
communist
party,
that
that
was
its
purpose.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
accepting
that
there
is
no
evidence
for
any
purpose
at
all.
there
isn't
even
any
evidence,
any
indirect
evidence
that
could
be
suggested
by
saying
that
the
veterans
was
giving
--
were
giving
money
to
communist
party,
they
have
no
money.
they
have
no
resources.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
just
a
few
hundreds
are
left.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
exactly,
your
honor.
half
of
the
members
--
more
than
half,
as
the
record
shows
or
the
government
have
some
reservations,
more
than
half
died
in
spain.
and
of
course
many
have
died
since
then
or
i
may
say
that
many
of
them
were
recognized
by
the
united
states
government
as
heroes
of
world
war
ii.
but
there
are
only
a
few
hundred
that
constitute
this
threat
now,
to
the
government
of
the
united
states.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
some
dues
occasionally.
there
isn't
much
money
of
any
kind
here.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
precisely.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
the
year
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
of
course,
the
organization
began
and
i
should
have
indicated
more
fully
with
one
principle
purpose
--
rehabilitation.
your
honor
knows
how
men
who
come
back
from
the
army
particularly
after
the
spanish
civil
war
would
have
meant.
but
they
went
through
--
they
needed
rehabilitation
of
all
kinds
--
that
has
remained
the
principle
function
of
the
organization.
and
there's
a
footnote
referenced
to
the
budget
and
with
somewhere
out
of
$13,000
or
$11,000
is
used
for
rehabilitation.
actually
what
has
happened
is
that
the
organization
like
many
other
organizations
in
this
last
decade,
dwindles
so
that
it
was
not
a
very
important
organization
although
what
it
did
was
to
basically
continue
in
its
functions
of
opposing
franco.
if
this
organization
could
be
set
to
be
distinguished
from
all
other
organizations
in
the
country,
it
would
be
that
its
position
of
being
anti-franco
stems
from
1936,
it
never
changed
before
the
pact
or
after
the
pact,
this
was
its
central,
its
raised
on
that
draft,
your
honors
can
understand
how
that
would
be
and
view
of
this
--
what
demand
had
gone
through.
then
of
course,
after
the
organization
moved,
after
the
organization
moved
to
the
more
recent
period,
it
found
itself
as
a
defense
organization
defending
itself.
and
right
now
its
principal
activity
i
regret
to
say
is
defending
itself
in
this
very
proceeding.
now,
the
government's
argument
that
aid
and
support
mean,
aid
and
support,
because
there's
an
ultimate
plan
to
help
the
communist
party
without
any
indication
of
a
causal
relationship.
it
seems
to
me
it
create
a
vagueness
problem
with
respect
to
the
terms
aid
and
support,
as
used
in
section
4
and
with
respect
to
the
terms
objective
as
used
in
section
2.
and
that
we
do
not
have
in
this
case
mr.
justice
harlan
the
precision
of
standards
which
it
then
pointed
out
at
--
pointed
out
at
page
135
to
139
of
its
brief
on
the
communist
party
case.
and
in
the
communist
party
case,
the
government
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
objectives
of
the
communist
party
that
it
was
concerned
with
was
very
different
from
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
today.
i
just
want
to
read
one
line
from
the
--
from
the
communist
party
case.
“we
submit
--”,
said
the
government
at
page
104
of
its
brief
there
“that
congress
have
the
constitutional
power
to
require
disclosure
from
such
organizations
which
are
actively
working
to
overthrow
the
government,
and
which
together
with
the
world
communist
movement
as
a
whole
produce
a
grave
danger
that
their
purpose
will
be
achieved”.
and
it
is
very
helpful
to
read
what
the
government
said
in
the
case
where
it
was
attempting
to
have
the
court
uphold
the
constitutionality
of
this
very
grave
statute
to
find
that
after
its
exceeded,
in
indicating
the
nature
of
the
danger
which
deserve
a
decision
of
constitutionality
that
it
then
moved
to
the
lesser
thing
which
can
hardly
be
called
a
threat
to
security
of
the
country.
and
if
one
examines
the
four
activities
which
were
described
in
our
brief,
defense
under
the
smith
--
of
two
people
under
the
smith
act,
defense
in
this
proceeding
opposition
to
franco,
spain
and
even
opposition
to
the
internal
security
act.
i
suggest
that
none
of
them
can
be
said
within
--
within
the
contemplation
of
congress,
and
as
opposing
the
internal
security
act,
there's
no
law
that
says,
“you
have
to
like
your
hangman”.
now,
the
government
would
make
a
radical
extension
and
this
i
think
is
critical
here
and
that's
why
i
referred
your
honors
to
the
government's
brief
in
the
communist
party
case
which
is
more
important
i
think
than
this
brief
for
this
case.
i
think
we
can
agree
that
the
worst
fears
of
the
opponents
of
the
internal
security
act
of
1950
have
been
realized,
and
i
referred
to
president
truman
in
his
veto
message
to
zechariah
chafee,
to
senator
frank
graham
and
then
of
course
senator
lehman,
that
whole
group,
people
who
stood
up
and
were
afraid
of
exactly
this.
and
then
the
late
senator
lehman
and
senator
kilgore
who
propose
a
bill
that
are
in
some
respect
was
almost
worst
and
then
it
was
adopted
and
it
become
a
part
of
the
statute.
we
refer
to
the
consultation
and
provisions.
but
they
were
very
worried
and
the
way
in
which
the
board
has
preceded
or
the
government
has
proceeded
here
has
indicated
what
exactly
what
they
are
afraid
has
just
come
to
pass.
but
i
think
the
court
here
has
another
test
as
to
what
is
the
right
way
to
construe
this
statute
and
that
is
what
were
the
views
or
responses
of
legislation.
what
does
congressman
walter
say?
what
does
senator
mccarran
say?
and
if
the
board
adopt
there
--
if
the
court
adopt
their
views,
then
the
court
will
agree
that
this
proceeding
should
never
been
started.
this
court
has
carefully
distinguished
the
communist
party
from
all
other
organizations
in
america.
now,
i
agree
completely
with
the
dissenting
views
stated
by
mr.
justice
black
in
the
communist
party
case
and
there
is
no
suggestion
in
my
position
here
that
i
agree
that
that
decision
was
correct
or
that
i
believe
that
the
selectivity
of
that
organization
would
justify,
but
i
am
here
addressing
the
court
which
has
rendered
a
decision,
now
i
should
be
very
happy
to
reargue,
or
let
mr.
forer
reargue
the
communist
party
case
if
the
court
are
willing.
my
point
is
somewhat
different,
this
court
has
made
the
communist
party
sui
generis,
just
as
the
legislature
has
done
so,
and
having
going
to
the
point
of
distinguishing
the
communist
party
from
all
organizations
as
mr.
justice
jackson
did
in
doud
although
not
for
the
reasons
suggested
my
friend
mr.
terris.
and
as
mr.
justice
jackson
did
in
detail
and
almost
legislative
detail
in
dennis,
as
judge
learned
hand
did
in
dennis.
and
as
indeed
if
we
compare
the
opinion
in
barenblatt
by
mr.
justice
harlan
with
the
opinion
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
concurred
by
mr.
justice
harlan
in
sweezy
and
even
if
we
go
to
the
internal
operation
of
communist
party
and
we
compare
yates
and
noto
with
dennis
and
scales,
this
court
has
made
a
very
definite
judgment
over
down
in
history,
legal
history
i
don't
know,
a
judgment
that
the
communist
party
represents
a
special
danger
which
every
agency
of
the
government
has
a
right
to
protect
the
people
against.
and
the
findings
and
the
subversive
activities
control
act,
that's
the
act
of
terrorism,
of
a
desire
to
have
a
totalitarian
government
in
the
united
states
although
not
by
totalitarian
means
of
course.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
right.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
think
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
don't
want
to
argue
with
you
mr.
justice
harlan
about
the
inclusion.
i
really
think
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
what
your
honor
is
saying
is
your
honor
--
that
the
court
has
never
said,
“we
take
the
communist
party.
we
are
upholding
a
judgment
of
the
legislature
with
respect
to
the
special
quality
of
the
communist
party”.
for
my
purposes,
i
think
that
is
technically
correct
although
some
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
some
justices
would
believe
that
there
was
an
actual
attainment.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
had
not
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
accept
your
honor's
statement
--
and
that
for
my
purposes
is
sufficient
here
because
in
the
end
that
comes
down
to
a
recognition
by
the
legislature,
upheld
by
the
court,
as
to
the
special
quality
of
communist
party.
and
it
is
a
quality
which
is
distinct
from
all
other
organizations
that
have
been
said
to
have
been
influenced,
controlled,
dominated,
whether
it's
a
progressive
party
in
one
case
or
whether
was
a
two
organizations
that
your
honor
and
didn't
have
to
consider
in
barenblatt,
i
can't
remember
what
they
were
at
the
moment
or
whether
it
is
so-called
communist-front.
now,
the
government
had
made
reference
to
mr.
justice
jackson's
views
in
doud
or
dennis
as
i
recall.
dennis
it
must
have
been
as
to
the
dangers
of
overthrow
in
hungary
and
czechoslovakia,
which
justifies
in
the
government's
view
the
current
actions
against
so-called
communist-front
organizations.
when
your
honors
look
at
what
mr.
justice
jackson
said,
your
honors
will
see
that
he
was
referring
to
a
paramilitary
organization
as
he
described
it
at
czechoslovakia
and
hungary.
and
he
was
concerned
about
the
communist
party
and
not
about
an
organization
which
is
engaged
in
opposing
the
internal
security
act
or
an
organization
which
is
opposing
the
arrival
of
the
mayor
of
madrid
--
city
of
madrid
to
new
york.
we're
dealing
here
with
two
completely
different
things
and
it's
conceivable
to
me
that
the
author
of
those
telling
phrases
in
west
virginia
against
barnett
would
have
come
to
the
conclusions
of
the
government
does,
that
an
organization
of
this
type
engaged
not
only
on
the
surface
but
so
far
as
the
government
is
concerned
had
proven
under
the
service
as
well,
in
perfectly
legitimate
activities
that
this
kind
of
an
organization
should
now
be
required
to
register
and
should
suffer
the
various
penalties
that
had
been
indicated.
i
do
not
--
i
will
reserve
a
few
minutes
that
i
think
i
have
left
for
any
response
to
the
government
and
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
me
to
go
into
the
detailed
analysis
of
the
four
criteria
that
have
ben
mentioned
in
our
brief
under
section
13,
in
each
case
of
which
i
think
no
proof
has
been
made
out
to
support
the
application
of
the
criteria.
thank
you.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
we
also
think
it
comes
quite
close
to
deciding
the
case
for
different
reasons.
it
is
true
that
you
are
attempting
to
remove
the
mask
but
there
must
be
something
underneath
the
mask.
and
that's
the
reason
for
the
reference
of
section
2
(7)
to
the
objectives
which
you
refer
to
in
section
2
(6).
unless
an
organization
is
engaging
in
activities
which
bear
a
relationship
--
a
relationship
to
the
objective
of
the
statute,
how
can
it
be
said
that
the
statutes
are
directed
against
them.
and
what
the
counsel
here
is
suggesting
that
an
organization
or
an
individual
that
engages
in
good
works
will
under
some
theory
of
employed
purpose
be
found
to
be
covered
by
the
statute
because
the
good
works
here
are
particularly
obvious
when
the
description
of
the
activities
with
which
the
court
below
did
not
disagree.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
would
present
a
completely
different
problem
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
at
least
that
will
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
at
least
that
might
be
the
kind
of
thing
that
might
be
intended
to
covered,
the
constitutionality
would
be
a
different
problem.
now,
i
want
to
emphasize
to
the
court
that
we
have
been
discussing
something
almost
on
theoretical
level.
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
in
this
record,
none
at
all
to
show
that
the
activities
that
we're
engaged
in,
certainly
those
beginning
with
the
passing
of
the
statute
in
1950
had
any
relationship
not
only
to
the
bad
objectives
attributed
to
the
communist
party
but
even
to
good
ones.
there
is
no
indication
that
we
were
even
interested
in
helping
the
communist
party
and
things
with
which
we
will
be
in
general
approval.
there
is
no
connection
with
the
communist
party.
the
smith
act
thing
stands
on
its
own.
members
of
the
petitioning
union
were
being
prosecuted.
and
something
act
of
--
of
camaraderie
to
help
them
obviously,
particularly
against
the
statute
that
many
people
thought
was
oppressive.
this
organization
was
under
attack.
this
doesn't
require
wanting
to
help
the
communist
party
in
order
for
this
organization
itself
to
survive.
in
short,
each
one
of
the
activities
attributed
to
the
petitioner,
if
analyzed
objectively,
are
activities
that
would
be
rational
for
it
to
engage
in,
indeed,
irrational
for
it
not
to
engage
in
without
any
possible
reference
to
what
may
help
the
communist
party
either
in
illegal
objectives
or
in
building
up
an
image
if
we
take
that
argument
made
by
the
government.
now,
i
want
to
come
down
to
the
factual
evidence
which
is
completely
on
our
favor
on
the
subject
of
control.
there
has
been
a
discussion
here
--
well,
there
are
two
aspects,
first
i
trust
the
court
has
not
been
confused
by
all
the
reference
have
been
made,
to
what
happened
in
spain
in
1936,
with
respect
to
a
different
organization,
the
members
of
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade,
the
similarity
in
part
and
the
names
should
not
make
us
forget
that
we
are
dealing
with
an
organization
created
here
in
1939,
of
the
survivors
of
the
old
group.
secondly
and
more
to
the
point
on
control,
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
your
honors
that
the
executive
boards
which
has
been
referred
to
by
counsel
in
his
oral
argument
and
which
is
described
in
the
brief
even
as
something
having
an
important
part
in
running
petitioner,
this
is
what
the
government
says
in
its
brief,
an
important
part
in
running
petitioner.
that
executive
board
and
its
important
part
in
running
petitioner
is
segment
of
imagination.
let
me
indicate
your
honors
how
that
is.
the
testimony
and
the
record
is
that
this
organization
was
run
by
two
people
really
by
one,
by
mr.
fishman
who
did
not
function
in
the
organization
as
an
operating
head
until
1950
and
by
mr.
wolff
as
a
consultant.
your
honors
will
turn
to
the
record
at
page
106,
it
says,
not
that
there
was
an
executive
board
running
the
organization,
the
other
principle
office
of
the
valb,
middle
of
the
page,
is
the
finding
of
the
board
your
honor,
not
just
a
discussion,
is
the
executive
secretary
who
was
formally
has
provided
the
constitution,
designated
secretary
treasurer,
your
honors
will
then
see
a
footnote
to
the
board's
own
finding
in
which
its
says,
the
evidence
shows
and
will
so
testify,
that
the
executive
secretary
is
now
and
for
the
past
few
years
has
been
the
principal
operating
officer,
handling
finances
as
well
as
most
of
other
organizational
business.
and
on
the
next
page
on
107,
again
the
board
repeats,
respondent
has
been
operated
--
operated
for
the
past
five
years
into
the
present
but
through
two
principal
active
officers,
naming
them
wolff
and
fishman.
and
whatever
reference
there
is
to
the
executive
board
is
a
statement
made
somewhere
in
this
record
that
it
has
that
function
since
1949.
now,
where
have
we
suddenly
built
up
an
executive
board
that
exercises
so
important
a
function
in
the
operations?
your
honors
will
recall
a
reference
made
to
a
letter,
very
ambiguous,
hardly
to
propound
on
evidence
rule
or
the
clear
rule
of
evidence
required,
a
letter
signed
by
a
number
of
people
which
contains
the
word
executive
board
is
by
no
means
clear
that
the
word
for
the
40
executive
boards
were
not
signed
by
mr.
fishman
and
mr.
wolff,
instead
of
by
the
other
signatories
as
your
honors
will
say.
but
let
me
assume
--
let
me
assume
everything
the
government
says
that
there
was
an
executive
board,
the
board
hasn't
found
that
it
was
running
--
the
board
below
running
this
organization
and
let
me
assume
even
further
that
i'm
wrong
this
and
that
the
board
where
to
--
where
to
have
made
a
finding
that
he
executive
order
instead
of
the
two
individuals
i've
mentioned
was
running
the
valb.
what
are
the
facts
with
respect
to
these
individuals?
i
regret
to
say
that
mr.
maroney
was
not
quite
accurate
in
his
general
statement
that
there
was
an
executive
board
of
11,
that
there
were
communist
party
functionaries
and
they
were
running
the
board.
the
evidence
shows
as
follows,
first,
two
persons
on
the
executive
board
were
forced
fishman
and
wolff
who
as
we
say
were
running
the
organization.
the
evidence
says
to
them
if
it
is
believed
that
it's
quite
fragmentary,
if
your
honors
will
see
from
the
record,
we've
cited
it,
is
1940
and
1941.
and
we're
dealing
with
the
period,
i
won't
say
1964,
1950
to
1955,
as
to
them
only
1940
and
1941.
then
you
take
four
persons
of
this
eleven-man
executive
board,
part
of
the
court
below
rely
as
being
connected
with
the
communist
party.
wiessman,
nelson,
smith,
and
love,
only
four
out
of
the
eleven
answered
the
question
by
one
member
of
the
court.
and
out
of
those
four,
how
did
judge
bazelon
dispose
them.
he
said,
as
to
wiessman
the
latest
evidence
with
respect
to
1949,
that's
the
most
recent.
nelson
1946,
smith
1938,
love
--
we've
been
disposed
of
love
i
think
to
today
in
that
sense.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
wolff
and
fishman
testified
before
the
board
that
they
were
running
the
organization,
yes
your
honor.
and
their
testimony
as
far
--
on
this
point
is
credited.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
wolff
cited
the
fifth
amendment
with
respect
to
membership
with
communist
party.
i
don't
have
to
tell
or
mention
to
the
court
the
absence
of
inference
is
to
be
drawn
from
testimony
of
that
kind
of
course.
there
is,
i
beg
you
pardon.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
sorry,
i'm
told
that
mr.
fishman
did
not
testify
to
the
court.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
there
was
a
--
your
honor
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
with
respect
to
that
--
well,
there
was
no
evidence
with
respect
to
fishman
but
your
honor
will
recall
that
the
one
reference
that
fishman,
the
one
reference
to
fishman
is
the
statement
made
by
a
witness
that
in
1940,
some
13
years
before
the
board
was
taking
testimony,
there
had
been
an
admission
concerning
membership.
i
suggest,
your
honor
that
the
presumption
must
wear
out
after
a
few
years.
certainly,
it
should
not
last
13
years
when
based
upon
the
fragmentary
testimony
of
one
witness.
now,
i
have
been
discussing
up
to
now
and
i
think
i
have
indicated
to
your
honors
that
at
the
most,
there
were
four
people
on
this
executive
board
of
eleven
assuming
the
executive
board
was
in
existence,
assuming
that
its
function
--
assuming
that
its
function
contrary
to
the
findings
made
by
the
board
below
that
organization
was
run
by
these
two
men.
and
remember
that
the
court
below
with
respect
to
fishman
and
wolff
found
that
they
were
not
functionaries
of
the
communist
party
or
representative
of
the
communist
party.
so
that
we
have
nothing
to
show
control
by
the
communist
party,
either
by
its
--
through
the
officers
or
through
the
members
after
1950.
now
as
to
the
activities,
there's
no
point
in
view
of
the
time,
i'm
going
into
them.
i
merely
say
that
i
have
look
to
the
government's
brief
to
which
my
friend
just
referred
in
which
he
described
that
on
certain
pages,
the
activities
if
the
organizations
are
set
forth.
he
said
pages
40
to
46,
all
of
those
activities
seemed
to
me
to
be
pre-statutory.
and
then
when
i
looked
at
pages
59
to
60
which
he
says
a
post-statutory,
i
can
find
nothing
in
those
pages
which
reflects
any
activities
to
have
any
bearing
at
all
upon
the
subject
of
this
case.
now,
maybe
he
can
--
he
can
broaden
them
out
and
summarize,
but
there
is
nothing
on
those
pages
that
supports
the
statement
that
this
organization
engaged
in
anything
after
1950
except
the
things
found
by
the
court
below,
anti-franco
to
the
subject
that
mixed
point
of
view
here
by
the
two
gentlemen
opposing
us
--
anti-franco,
antifascism,
rehabilitation
the
principal
function,
defensive
members
in
smith
act
proceedings,
and
the
defense
in
this
case.
and
a
lot
of
answers
are
placed
by
the
other
side
upon
our
defense
of
ourselves
in
this
case.
i
think
this
will
be
the
first
case
in
which
the
defense
of
an
organization
has
been
held
to
prove
that
it
was
intended
to
be
covered
by
the
statute
as
therefore
criminal.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
we
have
made
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
your
honor,
we
think
that
this
is
an
issue
that
ought
to
be
to
reconsider
by
the
court.
we
don't
think
that
the
court
is
correct
in
its
position
to
the
communist
party
case.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i'll
--
we'll
accept
the
statement
with
respect
to
the
change
of
the
regulations,
it
only
indicate
that
i'll
be
most
surprised
that
any
attorney
or
any
individual
not
an
attorney
were
willing
to
come
forward
and
after
they
volunteer
under
these
circumstances
for
any
organizations
rendered
as
a
communist-front
organization
under
statute,
particularly
--
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
observations
made
by
counsel
earlier
as
to
the
fact
that
some
attorneys
engaged
in
representing
communist
interest
might
very
well
be
considered
covered
by
the
statute
or
by
similar
statutes.
i
see
no
reason
for
anyone
to
take
the
chance
and
i
will
suggest
and
i
think
it's
little
presumptuous
to
suggest
that
i
will
take
the
chance
what
any
other
lawyer
will
do
so.
thank
you
your
honor.
