i
understand
the
government's
position
at
least
in
the
argument
in
the
last
case,
it
was
--
it
wasn't
anything
subtle,
subtle
as
fraud,
isn't
it,
and
that
was
simply
the
purpose,
what's
the
purpose
of
the
organization.
justice

stewart
well,
isn't
that
the
rational
rather
than
true,
i
think
i
would
agree
with
that.
justice
potter
stewart
of
what?
justice
potter
stewart
primarily
this,
the
volunteer
for
liberty
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
propaganda.
justice
potter
stewart
part
of
the
13
--
justice

stewart
between
--
published
between
september
1951
and
june
1954?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
what
pages
of
your
brief
did
you
just
say?
46
to
46?
justice
potter
stewart
40
to
46?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
government
you
said
--
it's
never
been
held
that
the
government
cannot
make
a
determination
about
an
organization?
justice
potter
stewart
and
maybe
in
the
abstract
that's
true,
maybe
it
isn't.
but
there
has
to
be
some
governmental
purpose
behind
it
i
assume.
justice
potter
stewart
and
just
to
pin
that
label
on,
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
really
what's
the
issue
here.
justice
potter
stewart
seems
to
me
that
there
would
be
a
good
deal
unless
the
charity
were
operating
interstate.
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
