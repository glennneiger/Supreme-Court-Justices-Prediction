mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
intend
first
to
outline
very
generally
the
findings
of
the
board
and
then
to
discuss
the
sufficiency
and
the
other
evidentiary
questions
raised.
mr.
terris
will
then
conclude
the
government's
argument
on
the
constitutional
question.
now,
the
evidence
before
the
board
in
this
case
consists
of
4500
pages
of
typewritten
transcript
of
testimony.
there
are
also
over
300
exhibits.
the
board
on
the
basis
of
this
extensive
evidence
has
written
a
report
summarizing
a
good
benefit,
making
its
findings
and
conclusions
which
takes
over
more
than,
takes
up
more
than
200
pages
of
the
printed
transcript
or
the
printed
record
in
this
court.
the
court
of
appeals
in
accordance
with
its
responsibility,
primary
responsibility
under
section
14
(a)
of
the
statute
has
carefully
reviewed
the
testimony
and
on
the
basis
of
that
review
has
affirmed
the
findings
of
the
board,
the
essential
findings
of
the
board.
and
in
--
in
that
connection,
i
would
like
also
to
emphasize
that
the
essential
test
has
been
explored
yesterday
and
today.
the
essential
test
to
be
applied
by
the
court
to
reviewing
the
board's
order
is
as
set
forth
in
section
3
(4)
of
the
statute
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
evidence
shows
preponderantly
that
the
organization
is
dominated
and
controlled
and
operates
primarily
to
give
aid
and
support
to
the
communist
party.
the
four
types
of
evidence
which
section
13
(f)
of
the
statute
specifies,
wants
to
be
taken
into
consideration
by
the
board
are
simply
that.
they
are
statutory
requirement
that
in
arriving
at
the
ultimate
determination,
the
board
shall
consider
those
types
of
evidence.
now,
i
intend
to
take
up
at
a
few
minutes
the
specific
or
a
couple
of
these
specific
contentions
made
in
the
brief
and
in
an
argument
this
morning
as
to
the
claimed
differences
and
approach
by
the
court
of
the
appeals
and
the
board,
and
especially
with
the
argument
relating
to
the
insufficiency
of
the
post-1950
evidence
and
the
court
of
appeals
finding
concerning
wolff
and
fishman
and
whether
or
not
the
board's
conclusion,
their
functionaries
is
warranted.
but
before
getting
into
those
specific
questions
of
sufficiency,
i
think
that
it's
relevant
to
place
those
arguments
in
proper
context
and
that
is
in
light
of
all
the
evidence
that
was
received
and
considered
by
the
board
and
by
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
the
international
brigades
which
became
a
part
of
the
spanish
republican
army
in
1936
were
setup
in
that
year
and
the
evidence
in
the
case
shows
that
the
international
brigades
were
headed
and
controlled
by
the
communist
party,
by
the
communist
international
actually.
the
leader
of
the
brigades
was
andre
martin
who
was
a
leader
of
the
french
communist
party
and
a
member
of
the
executive
committee
of
the
communist
international.
the
second
in
command
of
the
international
brigades
was
luigi
gallo,
now
known
i
believe
is
luigi
longo,
and
a
leader
of
the
communist
party
in
italy.
the
evidence,
and
rather
extensive
evidence
i
think,
clearly
showed
that
the
brigade
had
political
commissars
operated
under
communist
party
discipline.
its
literature
was
censored
and
its
members
were
politically
indoctrinated
and
many
of
them
urged
to
join
the
communist
party.
as
matter
of
fact,
some
of
the
members
of
the
brigade
joined
the
communist
party
of
spain
while
they
were
in
spain.
one
such
member
according
to
the
testimony
was
milton
wolff
who
was
in
spain
as
the
commander
of
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade.
before
he
went
to
spain,
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
young
communist
league.
while
he
was
in
spain,
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
witness,
hecht,
he
joined
the
communist
party
of
spain.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
sir?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
hecht,
h-e-c-h-t,
hecht
who
was
--
who
was
an
american
member
of
the
communist
party
who
had
gone
to
spain
to
join
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade.
and
he
of
course
also
went
under
the
officers
of
the
communist
party.
i
think
in
that
connection
it's,
it's
worthy
of
note
that
of
six
government
witnesses
who
had
been
in
spain,
five
of
them
had
been
members
of
the
party
at
the
time
they
went
and
of
course
and
all
six
of
them
went
under
the
officers
of
the
communist
party.
now,
further
showing
the
domination
by
the
communist
party
and
of
course
the
crucial
interest
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it
had
--
the
principle
executive
officers.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
a
nine-man
executive
board
and
wolff
who
is
a
national
commander
and
fishman
who
was
the
executive
secretary.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
not
all.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
eight
of
11
of
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
were
members
of
the
party.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
that
was
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
the
holding
is
that
based
on
the
evidence
which
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
the
holding
of
the
board
and
the
court.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
i
think
that's
what
they
both
did,
the
board
and
the
court
that
as
of
the
time
that
we're
speaking
of,
that
is
1952
when
they
had
this
evidence
of
the
nine-man
executive
committee
and
the
two
other
officers,
that
as
of
that
time,
the
inference
was
and
is
and
they
so
held
that
they
were
members
--
eight
of
the
11
were
members
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
no.
it
was
primarily
based
on
evidence
which
covered
the
entire
period
from
1936,
from
1938
to
1939
up
to
1950.
and
then,
in
addition,
there
was
the
evidence
which
directly
related
to
activities
of
this
organization
in
the
1950
to
1954
period.
but
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
i
think
we
get
a
better
picture
of
the
reasonableness
of
that
inference
if
i
could
just
carry
through
for
four
or
five
minutes
and
give
some
of
the
additional
extensive
evidence
that
this
court
--
that
the
board
did
rely
on
in
making
its
ultimate
determination.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right
sir.
everything
that
i'm
talking
about
at
the
moment
will
be
pre-1950.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
now,
when
i
get
to
1950
i'll
carry
it
over
specifically.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
now,
as
i
indicated,
there
is
also
extensive
evidence
here
that
earl
browder
constantly
reiterated
that
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade
was
a
party
responsibility.
there
is
also
evidence
that
the
membership,
the
communist
party
membership
in
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade
constituted
50%
or
60%
of
the
brigade.
of
course
there
were
members
of
the
brigade
who
were
not
members
of
the
communist
party.
but
the
point
is
that
the
communist
party
was
the
motivating
factor
in
the
formation
of
the
brigades
and
of
course
they
were
interested
in
bringing
in
people
who
were
sympathetic
to
the
cause
of
the
brigades
and
the
communist
international
united
front
effort
in
spain
and
of
course
many
of
the
persons
who
were
in
the
brigade
were
not
members
of
the
party.
now,
on
the
basis
of
this
extensive
background
information,
the
board
concluded
that
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade
was
dominated
and
controlled
by
the
communist
party
and
that
its
members
were
subject
to
communist
discipline.
and
i
would
just
like
to
point
to
one
additional
piece
of
evidence
that
relates
to
the
period
of
the
spanish
war
and
is
primarily
of
significance
i
think
in
light
of
the
argument
with
respect
to
the
present
officers
and
particularly
mr.
wolff,
the
national
commander.
on
page
71
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
of
the
record.
the
board
narrates
evidence
relating
to
a
meeting
in
spain
in
october
1938,
which
followed
the
withdrawal
of
the
brigades
from
the
war.
in
which
there
is
evidence
of
a
meeting
and
dinner
in
marces,
spain
where
milton
wolff
was
also
present
and
minor,
robert
minor
who
is
a
member
of
the
politburo
of
the
american
communist
party
at
that
time.
minor
recounted
with
the
minute
going
through
stating
that
it
was
their
duty
to
bring
forward
in
the
united
states
what
they
had
learned
in
spain
to
advance
the
cp-usa
and
to
raise
the
political
education
of
the
american
people
who
are
lagging
behind
the
struggle,
that
they
were
now
firmed
communist
prepared
by
their
experiences
to
do
outstanding
work
for
the
party
and
mass
organizations
in
the
united
states.
now
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
mr.
robert
minor
who
at
that
time
was
a
member
of
the
politburo,
the
central
committee
of
the
communist
party
of
united
states.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
with
this
organization?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
he
was
a
communist
party
functionary,
your
honor.
he
was
--
i'm
not
sure
that
he
was
a
member
--
i
think
he
was,
has
always
been
a
member
of
the
veterans
of
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade.
the
significance
of
this
i
think
is
that
here
is
a
leading
communist
official
telling
the
members
of
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade
that
now
that
they
have
learned
their
communist
--
have
had
their
communist
training
that
they
should
come
back
to
the
united
states
now
and
further
put
it
into
operation.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
this
was
1938.
this
was
right
at
the
point
where
the
brigade
was
being
withdrawn
from
the
spanish
republican
army
and
was
preparing
to
return
to
the
united
states.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh
no.
well,
the
veterans
of
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it
began
to
come
into
existence
in
the
period
of
about
1937
and
1938.
the
witnesses
lautner
and
budenz
testify
as
to
attend,
their
attendance
at
politburo
meetings
in
those
years
at
which
there
were
discussions
of
setting
up
this
organization.
and
budenz
testifies
that
members
and
officers
of
the
communist
party
and
a
comintern
representative
were
detailed
as
liaison
with
the
proposed
new
organization.
budenz
also
testified
that
the
politburo
approved
the
constitution,
post-constitution
of
the
veterans
of
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade
and
that
paul
burns,
a
communist
party
functionary
was
appointed
by
the
politburo
as
the
first
national
commander
of
the
veterans
of
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade.
he
also
testified
that
as
to
the
communist
party
furnishing
funds
to
the
veterans
of
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade
to
assist
it
in
getting
itself
established.
now,
this
is
the
period
of
1937
and
1938
when
most
of
the
members
of
the
brigade
were
still
in
spain.
in
the
latter
part
of
1938,
most
of
these
people
returned
to
the
united
states
and
in
1939,
there
was
a
formalizing
convention
of
the
veterans
of
abraham
lincoln
brigade.
and
it
is
--
at
that
convention
that
the
--
that
mr.
wolff
was
named
national
commander
of
the
valb
and
he
has
served
in
that
capacity
up
to
the
present
time.
the
board
think
the
evidence
is
perfectly
clear
that
that
convention
was
staffed
by
members
of
the
--
by
officers
and
members
of
the
communist
party
and
that
many
of
the
principal
officers
who
were
elected
at
that
convention
including
of
course
the
national
commander,
mr.
wolff
were
members
and
officers
of
the
communist
party
and
the
board
so
found.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
for
example,
for
example
--
for
example
steve
nelson
who
--
because
of
his
activities
in
spain
in
behalf
of
the
brigade
was
co-opted
that
is
just
appointed
rather
than
being
elected
to
the
national
committee
of
the
politburo
of
the
communist
party,
steve
nelson
in
about
1938
replaced
a
comintern
representative
as
the
liaison
with
the
veterans
of
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade,
steve
nelson
is
one
of
the
11
present
members
of
this
--
of
the
national
executive
committee.
i
think
as
far
as
the
membership
or
the
officership
of
this
organization,
the
board
has
made
extensive
findings
and
as
a
matter
fact
concluded
that
without
exception,
every
principal
officer
of
this
organization
has
been
a
communist
party
functionary
and
representative.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
they
do
more
than
that.
they
do
more
than
that.
i
mean
the
problem
is
that
the
board
in
making
that
overall
conclusion
is
of
course
dealing
with
different
periods
of
time.
but
in
developing
that
to
the
present
finding,
the
board
of
course
does
recognize
the
requirement
that
the
officer
of
the
valb
must
be
concurrently
a
member
or
officer
or
a
functionary
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
now,
i'd
have
to
concede
your
honor
that
with
respect
to
smith
and
smith
alone
and
because
of
the
peculiar
circumstance
in
his
case
and
the
information
in
the
record
that
he
remained
loyal
to
earl
browder
--
that
we
find
it
difficult
to
defend
the
inference
that
he
continued
to
be
a
functionary
into
1950.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
but
with
respect
to
the
outcome
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
that's
the
government's
burden.
i
think
the
government
carry
that.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh
no.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
your
honor
i
say
that
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
of
them
that
eight
of
the
11
were
--
are
members
of
the
communist
party
now.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
as
far
as
i'm
concern
(voice
overlap)
i
find
it
difficult
to
defend
to
the
inference
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
to
that
one
of
the
eight,
that
he
continued
to
be
a
member.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
sir?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
thank
you.
i
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that
leaves,
well
no
--
you
see
they
were
11
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
eight
of
whom,
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
to
be
members
of
the
party
including
smith.
now,
i
mean
even
if
we
take
away
smith
by
concession
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
and
of
course,
i
don't
think
that
it's
our
prerogative
to
substitute
our
judgment
for
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
board
but
i
just
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
evidence,
and
i
find
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
as
to?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
as
to
membership
(voice
overlap)
as
to
membership
because
of
the
peculiar
piece
of
evidence
that
he
remain
loyal
to
browder
and
i
mean
it
would
be
inconsistent
of
course
that
he
could
remain
loyal
to
browder
and
still
remain
loyal
to
the
party.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
in
my
mind
the
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
true.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh
no,
no.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
on
the
others
and
i
think
especially
in
light
of
the
overall
evidence
in
this
case.
i
think
the
inference
is
most
strong
and
especially
in
view
of
the
very
substantial
evidence
of
the
firm
control
by
the
communist
party
over
a
15-year
period
of
this
organization.
i
think
it's
a
compelling
inference
that
these
other
seven
or
the
eight
if
you
will
were
in
1952,
representatives
of
the
communist
party
in
their
capacity
as
members
of
national
executive
committee
of
this
organization,
and
i
think
that
that
is
is
--
buttressed
by
what
went
before.
what
happened
from
‘39
when
this
organization
was
setup
until
1950
when
we
do
get
into
the
period
where
an
inference
has
to
be
drawn
as
to
continued
relationship
between
this
organization
and
the
communist
party?
the
relationship
between
the
activities
of
this
organization
and
the
officership
of
this
organization
and
the
communist
party
are
so
close
that
the
board
was
impelled
to
call
it
a
hand
and
glove
relationship
and
you
couldn't
possibly
describe
it
in
any
other
way.
the
publicity
for
example
that
was
afforded
to
the
veterans
of
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade.
there's
a
--
on
page
125.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
on
page
125
of
the
record.
there's
a
quotation
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
from
daily
worker
article
in
1945.
and
in
that
article
it
said,
“there
is
one
group
of
american
citizens
that
has
a
special
right
to
be
heard
on
the
subject
of
our
relations
with
spain.
we
refer
of
course
to
the
veterans
of
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade”.
this
is
the
communist
party
of
course
talking
through
its
official
lawyer
and
daily
worker.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i'm
not
disputing
the
truth
or
the
accuracy
of
it.
i'm
speaking
of
the
support.
i'm
not
challenging
the
--
whether
the
statement
has
merit
or
not.
i
am
trying
to
show
that
this
is
just
one
of
many,
many
examples
of
the
communist
party's
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
treatment
and
high
regard
for
this
organization.
and
of
course
there's
much
more
background
to
this
and
that
of
course
is
our
problem
with
--
with
the
record
of
this
size.
the
communist
party
regarded
the
members
of
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade
as
being
the
flower
of
the
party.
these
were
the
people
who
had
gone
to
spain
and
who
had
fought
in
spain
in
the
antifascist
program
of
the
communist
party
and
they
had
demonstrated
their
loyalty
to
the
party.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh
no,
not
most
your
honor.
i
think
the
record
shows
that
more
than
50%
of
the
members
of
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade
in
spain
were
not
members
of
the
party.
but
the
record
also
shows
of
course
that
there
was
political
indoctrination
in
spain,
some
of
the
people
who
had
gone
there
not
as
members
later
did
become
members,
not
all
of
course.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh
no,
no.
i
--
other
than
as
discussed
in
this
record
as
to
75
or
80
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
members.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
it
was
in
some
instance
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
that's
true
but
the
people
who
did
go
into
--
well,
some
of
the
people
anyway
became
the
members
of
petitioner
and
certainly
the
leadership,
the
important
leadership
of
the
petitioner
organization,
we
think
very
clearly
were
dedicated
as
representatives
of
the
communist
party.
i
just
don't
think
you
can
read
this
report
without
--
without
coming
to
that
conclusion.
the
only
reason
i
refer
to
that
daily
worker
article,
i
think
it
points
out,
what
i've
just
been
trying
to
say
with
respect
to
the
parties
regard
for
the
veterans
of
the
abraham
lincoln
brigade
and
of
course
lautner
says
that
the
party
regarded
the
brigade
as
being
--
let's
just
say
were
trained
and
they
had
demonstrated
their
loyalty
and
so
forth,
that
the
party
regarded
the
brigade
as
a
source
for
promising
leaders
in
the
party.
and
of
course
the
evidence
here
demonstrates
very
clearly
that
many,
many
members
of
the
petitioned
organization
to
later
on
received
very
high
positions
in
the
communist
party.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
of
course
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
no
but
of
course
the
problem
is
--
this
is
just
one
of
thousands
of
pieces
of
evidence.
this,
the
only
reason
i
point
to
--
this
is
that
it
demonstrate
the
--
fondness
certainly
and
the
hand-in-hand
working
relationship
between
the
party
and
this
organization.
here
the
party
of
course
is
praising
the
brigade
as
being
the
expert
and
the
forefront
on
the
--
on
the
antifascism
theme.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
their
party
is
also
urging
its
members
to
buy
tickets
to
support
this
organization,
to
attend
this
affair.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
alright
now
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
now,
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
start
to
summarize
that
between
the
period
of
1939
or
1938
when
this
organization
was
established
and
1950
that
the
evidence
i
think
is
just
completely
clear
that
the
organization
was
dominated
and
controlled
by
the
communist
party.
now,
in
--
during
the
period
from
1950
to
1954,
the
evidence
is
principally
documented.
and
we
have
evidence
in
the
record
principally
through
the
volunteer
for
liberty
which
is
the
official
publication
of
this
organization,
that
during
that
period
they
engaged
as
the
court
of
appeals
summarized
primarily
in
campaigns,
propaganda,
campaigns
through
the
volunteer
for
liberty
in
defense
of
certain
members
of
the
party
who
have
been
indicted
under
the
smith
act.
some
of
whom
of
course
were
members
of
this
organization
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
in
on
of
itself?
no
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
in
and
of
itself
it
certainly
doesn't
establish
it.
we
don't
suggest
that
if
--
if
all
we
had
was
the
evidence
from
1950
to
1954,
we
would
concede
of
course
with
--
that
our
evidence
was
insufficient.
our
basic
position
is
this,
that
from
1938
to
1950
the
evidence
is
just
overwhelming
and
i
think
a
reading
of
this
record
would
demonstrate
it
that
this
organization
was
founded
by
the
communist
party,
aided
by
it,
it
aided
the
party.
during
those
fifteen
to
sixteen
years
it
aided
it
in
its
propaganda
efforts
in
paying,
furnishing
salaries,
and
so
forth
to
people
who
are
officers
of
the
communist
party.
it
aided
it
in
many
ways
like
that
such
as
the
establishment
of
the
browder
brigades
in
the
early
1940's
for
the
purpose
of
--
of
selling
subscriptions
to
the
daily
worker.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
that
--
it
is
our
essential
position
but
of
course
here
you
do
have
this
--
this
propaganda
activity
that
was
carried
on
and
of
course
which
in
phraseology,
in
purpose,
and
in
precise
areas
of
agreement
with
the
communist
party
in
the
case,
i
think
affirmatively
a
continuation
of
the
same
organization,
under
the
same
leadership
for
the
same
purposes
as
had
always
existed
back
to
1939.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
primarily
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
the
volunteer
for
liberty,
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
13
issues.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
and
they're
discussed
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
and
the
--
the
treatment
that
the
court
of
appeals
accords
to
those
certain
issues
and
our
theory
of
they
are
being
sufficient
to
carry
forward
the
influence
of
continued
nature
of
the
organization
is
exactly
the
theory
that
we
rely
in.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that
is
the
only
evidence
during
the
period
from
1950
to
1954,
yes.
and
i
think,
since
we
only
have
about
ten
minutes
left,
i'll
--
mr.
terris
will
continue
with
the
constitution
language
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
evidence?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
i
thought
i
had
alluded
to
it,
for
example,
i
had
showed
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
it
principally
--
the
principal
purpose
of
this
organization
of
course
was
to
urge
the
antifascist
program
of
the
--
of
the
communist
party.
the
communist
party
and
the
communist
international,
since
the
middle
or
late
1930's
has
had
a
united
front
program,
an
effort
to
seize
upon
a
certain
area,
a
political
area
or
a
propaganda
area
and
through
a
front
organization,
try
to
bring
along
with
it
for
the
purpose
of
antifascist
let's
say,
as
great
spectrum
of
the
population
as
possible
not
because
it
supporting
the
communist
party
but
because
it's
against
fascism.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
suppose
that's
a
policy
of
anybody.
but
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
your
honor,
antifascism
isn't
the
issue
in
this
case,
the
point
is.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh
no,
oh
no.
i
was
trying
to
explain
that
that
the
communist
party
used
this
organization
in
its
--
in
its
united
front
against
fascism
and
in
an
effort
to
bring
in
people
who
although
they
wouldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
communist,
certainly
as
most
people
are,
are
against
fascism.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
we
went
along
with
the
communist
party
here.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
just
i
said
i
assume
most
people
are
against
fascism
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
certainly.
