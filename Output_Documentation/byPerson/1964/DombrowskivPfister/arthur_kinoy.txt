mr.
arthur
kinoy
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
hubert
has
discussed
the
first
branch
of
our
position
which
is
that
baggett
against
bullitt
is
clearly
dispositive
here
in
respect
to
the
unconstitutional
breadth
of
the
statute.
i
think
it
would
be
important
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
washington
statute
involved
in
baggett
is
in
essence
the
same
statute,
paragraph
by
paragraph,
word
for
word
with
the
louisiana
statutes
here
involved.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
no
sir.
no
pending
criminal
prosecution
but
i
would
suggest
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
goldberg
and
yourself,
justice
harlan,
that
baggett
also
gives
us
the
answer
to
the
conceptual
problem
of
abstention
and
power
of
this
court
because
baggett
says
that
the
vice
in
these
statutes,
the
vice
in
this
statute,
the
essence
of
the
vice
is
the
deterrent
effect
upon
the
immediate
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
which
an
unconstitutionally
broad
and
vague
statute
creates.
now,
abstention
which
is
as
judge
wisdom
points
out,
one
finds
it
rather
difficult
to
figure
out
exactly
what
the
rationale
of
the
majority
of
the
district
court
was.
but
as
judge
wisdom
points
out,
it
was
probably
a
visceral
reaction
of
some
sort
that
to
grant
relief
at
this
point
would
impinge
upon
state's
rights.
but
justice
white
in
baggett
dealt
squarely
with
that
problem.
because
there,
the
problem
of
abstention
was
also
involved,
strongly
argued
and
ruled
upon
by
the
lower
court.
and
there,
in
meeting
the
problem
of
abstention,
justice
white
for
the
court
last
june
said
that
there
is
no
question
of
the
duty
of
a
federal
district
court
to
abstain
from
litigating
the
fundamental
constitutional
issue
involved
where
the
challenge
is
to
unconstitutional
vagueness
in
the
area
of
the
first
amendment
which
creates
an
immediate
deterrents
to
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.
what
is
the
clear,
the
immediate,
the
irreparable
injury
which
this
action
in
equity
asks
the
federal
court
to
release.
it
is
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
if
the
declaratory
judgment
declared
the
statutes
were
unconstitutional,
certainly
justice
white
because
then
the
whole
thing
falls.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
yes,
because
the
state
is
proceeding
to
enforce
the
statute
therefore,
it's
necessary
in
the
classic
terms
of
an
equity
court
where
there
is
clear,
present,
immediate
irreparable
injury
to
fundamental
rights.
the
concept
of
the
power
of
a
federal
court
of
equity
which
the
fifth
circuit
has
over
the
last
three
or
four
years
were
gone
to
wrestle
with
and
develop
a
concept
which
is
essential
in
the
civil
rights
cases
now
developing
in
the
south.
because
where
state
action
regardless
of
the
form
it
takes,
criminal
or
civil,
where
state
action
has
the
immediate
impact
of
casting
a
poll
upon
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
particularly
in
an
area
where
those
rights
are
essential
to
enforce
and
implement
the
struggle
to
bring
into
reality,
the
rights
granted
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
the
voting
rights,
in
a
situation
like
that
where
first
amendment
rights
are
essential
to
bring
about
an
enforcement
of
voting
rights,
there
particularly
the
fifth
circuit.
and
judge
wisdom
points
this
out
though
sharply
in
his
dissenting
opinion.
there,
the
fifth
circuit
has
said,
“it
is
the
duty
of
a
federal
court
of
equity
of
federal
district
court
not
to
refuse
to
litigate
and
adjudicate
this
fundamental
constitutional
federal
question”.
otherwise,
there
is
no
road
to
the
federal
court.
otherwise,
the
federal
court
is
saying
as
was
suggested
by
this
court
in
england,
justice
brennan's
opinion.
this
--
the
federal
district
court
is
saying,
the
federal
district
court
is
secondary
in
the
federal-state
system.
and
what
has
happened
here
is
the
warning
in
england
and
the
warning
in
justice
douglas'
opinion,
concurring
opinion.
what
has
happened
here
is
that
this
concept
of
deference
to
the
state
court
of
abstention
which
started
in
the
pullman
decision
has
now
turned
into
a
nightmare
in
the
south,
had
now
turned
in
to
it's
--
on
its
head.
and
what
has
happened
here
is
an
extraordinary
thing
as
judge
wisdom
points
out.
certainly,
the
federal
district
court,
like
the
majority
in
this
case,
seem
to
believe
that
what
abstention
means
is
that
you
differ
to
a
state
court
in
matters
of
federal
law
that
a
federal
district
court
may
not
rule
on
fundamental
federal
questions,
that
it
must
first
turn
to
the
state
court
and
the
state
court
will
adjudicate
it.
well,
the
answer
of
that
is
clearly
in
england.
the
answer
to
that
is
baggett
and
bullitt.
if
--
yes,
justice
goldberg.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
believe
it's
not
sir,
and
i
believe
the
distinction
is
the
distinction
that
judge
wisdom
makes
in
the
dissenting
opinion.
because
that
injury
to
the
constitutional
right
is
not
an
injury,
it's
that
a
deterrent
upon
the
exercise
of
fundamental
first
amendment
freedom.
now,
where
the
injury
in
the
state
action,
the
threatened
injury
is
to
deter
people
from
meeting
together,
from
speaking,
from
going
to
a
voter
registration
place
in
louisiana
because
they're
afraid
that
the
person
who
is
asking
him
to
go
to
the
voter
registration
place
is
a
scef
representative.
and
if
you
are
seen
with
the
scef
representative
in
louisiana,
you
may
well
be
indicted
for
violation
of
these
laws.
worst
than
that,
this
committee
which
is
the
primary
source
of
the
enforcement
of
these
laws
as
judge
wisdom
points
out,
not
three
months
after
the
institution
of
this
action
against
the
southern
conference
educational
fund
--
dr.
dombrowski
the
executive
director
and
again,
its
lawyers,
not
three
months
after
that
they
issued
a
report
in
which
they
told
us
what
the
next
step
of
the
selective
enforcement
of
these
laws
are
going
to
be.
they
issued
a
report
which
are
adversaries
are
brought
before
your
honors
as
an
exhibit
to
their
brief.
a
report
which
says
that
now
that
they
have
found
that
southern
conference
is
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
a
communist
organization,
a
subversive
organization,
they
now
find
that
the
southern
christian
leadership
conference,
dr.
martin
luther
king's
organization,
and
the
student
nonviolent
coordinating
committee
are
also
communist
dominated,
infiltrated
organizations
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
that
is
an
extraordinary
conclusion
but
what
it
points
out
is
the
deterrent
impact
of
the
possibility
of
selective
enforcement
which
--
mr.
arthur
kinoy
absolutely
your
honor.
that's
united
states
against
woods
which
is
an
extremely
interesting
opinion
of
judge
reed
in
the
fifth
circuit,
certiorari
denied
by
this
court.
that's
exactly
that
situation.
there
you
had
a
constitutional
statute.
i
believe
it
was
an
assault
and
battery
case
involved.
there,
judge
reed
said
for
the
majority
of
the
court,
“the
important
thing
is
not
what
the
label
that
the
state
puts
on
the
statute
but
the
state
is
using
this
clearly
to
harass
and
intimidate
a
voter
registration
movement
in
mississippi.
therefore,
we're
going
to
restrain
this
criminal
prosecution.
now,
i
should
make
one
point
on
that
which
i
think
disposes
totally
of
this
question
of
whether
we
have
to
awake
the
courses
of
the
normal
criminal
law
in
louisiana.
first
place,
the
clear
answer
to
that
is
that
that's
no
relief
to
the
deterrent
effect
of
these
statutes
on
the
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
who
are
about
to
engage
in
a
voter
registration
activity
movement
in
the
state
of
louisiana,
no
relief
whatsoever
but
more
than
that
very
simply.
this
court
is
disposed
of
that
problem
again
and
again
in
ex
parte
young,
in
fenner
against
boykin.
the
federal
proceeding
was
instituted
here
before
the
state
criminal
indictments.
only
last
term,
this
court
disposed
of
an
abstention
argument
and
i
believe
a
virginia
reapportionment
case
by
saying
that
we
don't
even
reach
that
question
because
if
you're
going
to
apply
concepts
of
committee
then
clearly,
the
federal
district
court
which
had
jurisdiction
although
our
district
court
judges
below
work
to
know
it
seems
they've
had
difficulty
in
discovering
a
ground
for
federal
jurisdiction
here.
where
the
federal
district
court
clearly
had
jurisdiction
and
we
think
not
even
our
opponents
argue
that
the
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction
and
it
starts
its
action,
we
started
our
action.
the
indictments
were
then
after
the
complaint
was
filed.
ex
parte
young
is
dispositive
on
that
question.
the
federal
court
is
seized
with
jurisdiction,
has
the
duty
and
obligation
to
proceed.
now,
if
i
may
turn
to
a
moment
for
another
side
of
the
coin
of
this
problem
because
this
appeal
brings
before
the
court,
it
calls
for
a
reexamination
and
reaffirmation
of
the
principles
of
supersedure
which
this
court
laid
down
11
years
ago
in
pennsylvania
against
nelson.
now,
these
statutes
and
the
case
before
the
court
at
this
moment,
i
would
suggest
a
classic
example
of
the
wisdom
of
the
court's
ruling
in
nelson
and
the
importance
of
a
strict
enforcement
of
this
rule
because
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
are
statutes
which
are
expressly
and
openly
designed
by
the
state
legislature
to
proscribe
the
same
conduct,
the
very
same
conduct
as
conduct
proscribe
by
a
complex
of
federal
statute.
now,
louisiana
leaves
nothing
to
our
imagination
on
this
question
because
we're
openly
informed
both
in
the
preambles
and
in
the
body
of
the
statute
that
the
conduct
to
be
regulated
is
identical.
identical
to
the
conduct
to
be
regulated
in
the
internal
security
act
and
the
communist
control
act,
and
what
is
it?
it's
conduct
which
flows
from
what
the
legislature
here
describes
as
activities
of
the
world
communist
movement.
it's
not
local
state
maneuvering
that
they're
talking
about.
they
describe
what
they
call
the
world
communist
conspiracy,
exactly
word
for
word
the
preamble
from
the
mccarran
act,
and
they
say
that's
the
conduct
we
are
going
to
regulate.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
justify
it
in
an
interesting
way
which
the
court
will
observe
in
the
preambles.
not
because
there's
something
concerning
local
affairs
but
because
in
their
opinion,
louisiana
is
different
from
other
states
in
the
union.
of
course,
louisiana
had
special
international
and
national
concerns
because
they
say
there
is
a
location
of
many
vital
military
establishments
of
the
nation
in
louisiana,
therefore,
we
have
to
enact
this
law.
now,
if
the
statutes
did
not
openly,
i
mean,
were
--
we
don't
have
a
situation
where
we
have
to
have
analogy
here
or
we
have
to
infer
anything.
the
legislatures
told
us
what
they're
doing
even
if
they
didn't.
we
have
an
extraordinary
statutory
scheme.
what
does
louisiana
want
to
do?
it
wants
to
punish
conduct
which
federal
agencies
have
designated
as
subversive
or
what
you
will,
whatever
that
word
means.
so
that
here,
our
state
has
set
up
a
structure
and
it
says,
when
the
subversive
activities
control
board
or
when
a
committee
of
congress
said
something
about
an
organization,
that's
the
conduct
we
want
to
do
something
about
because
that's
the
presumption
that
the
organization
is
subversive.
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court.
this
is
a
frank
effort
to
regulate
conduct
more
than
in
a
field
occupied
by
congress.
but
more
than
that,
what
is
astounding
about
it
is
that
they
want
to
put
penalties.
they
want
to
send
people
to
prison
for
six
years
because
they
belong
to
an
organization
named
by
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities.
well,
congress
itself
has
never
reached
that
level.
congress
itself,
i
would
suggest,
would
not
dream
of
enacting
legislation
like
that
that
says
nothing
of
the
constitutional
problems
that
are
involved.
but
what's
the
heart
of
the
matter.
the
heart
is
that
they
don't
really
argue.
that
these
statutes
do
not
move
into
an
area
occupied
by
congress.
the
heart
of
their
position
is
a
plea
to
overrule
nelson.
and
they
put
it
quite
just
bluntly
in
their
brief.
they
say,
even
if
the
louisiana
legislation
was
directed
at
the
same
conduct,
the
same
conduct,
the
words
of
this
court
governed
by
the
congressional
legislation,
no
--
there
is
no
valid
reason
why
there
could
not
be
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
this
field
as
there
is
in
so
many
other
criminal
matters.
that's
their
real
argument.
but
nelson
has
settled
down.
the
congress
has
occupied
this
field.
there
is
no
concurrent
state
jurisdiction
in
areas
occupied
by
the
internal
security
act
and
the
communist
control
act,
the
essence
of
the
problem.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
i
think
that
we
can
--
we
could
leave
your
honor
directly
within
the
uphaus
rule
because
in
uphaus,
mr.
justice
clark,
while
there
maybe
some
restrictions
on
the
breadth
of
nelson
which
are
not
involved
in
this
situation,
mr.
justice
clark
says
“in
reaffirming
nelson,
uphaus
does
not
overrule
nelson
as
certain
of
the
district
court
judges
seem
to
believe
and
some
of
our
adversaries
believe,
not
at
all.
in
uphaus,
the
test
is
the
same
conduct
test.
is
the
same
conduct
proscribe
by
the
state
legislation
as
the
federal
legislation,
we
say,
there
can
be
no
argument
on
that
here,
all
one
has
to
do
is
read
the
statutes
and
the
conduct
is
precisely
the
same
conduct
which
is
proscribed.
so
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
question
here
your
honor
as
to
the
farther
reaches
of
uphaus
or
the
farther
reaches
of
nelson.
here,
this
is
a
--
i
would
suggest
a
direct
open
in
the
chart
situation.
now,
the
essence
of
the
problem
and
the
reason
why
we
suggest
that
it
is
so
important
for
this
court
to
reaffirm
nelson
is
that
in
fact,
what
is
involved
here
is
that
louisiana
opposes
and
is
dissatisfied
with
the
policies
underlying
federal
enforcement
of
the
federal
statutes
occupying
this
area.
now,
they're
open
about
that,
they're
open.
they
openly
disagree
with
national
policies
of
enforcement
in
this
area
and
there
are
two
very
sharp
examples.
i
would
suggest
that
never
before
the
statute
come
before
this
court
in
which
the
legislature
says
openly
as
they
do
in
this
preamble.
the
reason
they're
passing
their
law
is
that
federal
legislation
on
this
subject
matter
is
either
inadequate
in
scope
or
not
being
effectively
enforced.
they
make
no
bones
about
it.
they
don't
believe
that
the
federal
anti-subversive
legislation
is
being
effectively
enforced
and
this
came
out
in
a
most
dramatic
way
when
as
the
day
after
the
raids
in
new
orleans
when
the
committee
said,
“why,
didn't
you
go
to
the
fbi?
you
say
there
is
a
question
of
subversion.
why
didn't
you
go
to
the
federal
authority?”
they
said
and
this
is
in
the
record,
“we
knew
that
if
we
told
the
fbi
about
this
raid,
they
would
have
to
tell
bobby
kennedy.
we
cannot
trust
him
and
we
expect
him
to
tell
his
friend
martin
luther
king.”
now
what
do
we
have
here?
you
put
that
together
with
the
preamble.
it's
a
fundamental
disagreement
with
federal
enforcement
policy
and
it's
illustrated
here.
louisiana
acted
to
enforce
these
laws
precisely
because
federal
policy
was
not
to
enforce
the
anti-subversive
laws
against
civil
rights
organizations
or
very
specifically
your
honors,
against
the
southern
conference
educational
fund
or
against
the
national
lawyers
guild.
there's
no
federal
proceeding
under
the
scab
against
southern
conference
educational
fund.
it's
never
been
named
on
the
attorney
general's
list.
it's
never
been
called
before
the
federal
agency
which
is
supposed
to
regulate
conduct
in
this
area.
and
as
the
court
knows
the
only
time
there
was
the
slightest
development
in
respect
to
national
lawyers
guild
was
when
the
attorney
general
once
started
a
proceeding
and
quickly
dropped
that
proceeding
informing
the
organization,
there
was
no
evidence
to
proceed.
national
federal
policy
in
the
last
several
years
has
been
clear
in
administering
the
federal
anti-subversive
laws
not
to
permit
them
to
be
“to
interfere
with
the
southern
civil
rights
movement
with
the
activities
of
negro
and
white
organizations
trying
to
implement
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
fifteenth.”
but
what
is
the
conflict
here?
judge
wisdom
put
his
finger
on
it
in
a
dissenting
opinion.
the
conflict
is
one
in
fundamental
policies
underlying
the
enforcement
of
laws
in
this
area.
judge
wisdom
says,
“the
louisiana
legislature
regards
the
movement
to
increase
negro
voting
in
that
state
as
part
of
the
communist
conspiracy”.
well,
that's
the
knub
of
the
matter.
they
want
to
use
this
concurrent
jurisdiction.
they
ask
this
court
to
give
them
in
reversing
nelson.
they
want
to
use
this
to
proceed
selectively
against
the
most
active
civil
rights
organizations
in
that
state.
now,
we
don't
have
to
speculate
against
that.
they
have
indictments
against
southern
conference
educational
fund
against
its
lawyers
who
represent
them,
southern
white
lawyers.
i
ask
this
court
to
consider
from
the
deterrent
point
of
view.
you're
going
to
ask
southern
white
lawyers
to
stand
up
and
be
counted,
to
make
the
responsibility
of
the
bar
when
you
permit
state
statutes
of
this
kind
to
be
used
to
arrest
them,
to
take
files
out
of
their
offices,
to
harass
them
because
they're
lawyers
to
southern
conference
educational
fund,
because
they
represent
civil
rights
organizations,
because
of
the
aclu
lawyer
in
louisiana.
well,
there
is
the
deterrence
which
is
no
longer
speculative
in
this
court.
this
court
doesn't
have
to
ask
hypothetical
questions
it
asked
in
baggett
against
bullitt.
those
questions
are
real
and
they're
in
this
record.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
what
was
that
your
honor?
what
white
--?
mr.
arthur
kinoy
well,
this
state
--
this
court
faced
that
problem
i
would
suggest
your
honor
in
nelson.
there
are
federal
statutes
which
are
on
the
books.
mr.
arthur
kinoy
oh
yes,
i
think
it's
clear.
the
congress
has
occupied
this
particular
field
and
that
law
is
clear
and
the
principles
are
clear
in
nelson.
more
than
that,
if
this
lawyer
who
is
a
communist
and
it's
hypothetical,
engages
and
then
it
overreacts
against
the
state.
if
he's
going
to
engage
in
a
conspiracy
as
judge
wisdom
points
out
to
occupy
the
state
house
or
to
bomb
the
state
house
or
if
he
is
going
to
engage
in
assault
and
battery
or
any
--
or
for
that
matter,
there
is
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
or
not
he
might
be
involved
in
a
prosecution
under
criminal
anarchy
law.
this
is
not
a
criminal
anarchy
law.
louisiana
has
separate
criminal
anarchy
laws
and
we
don't
reach
that
problem
here.
this
is
a
little
mccarran
act.
this
is
an
anti-subversive
organization
act
and
i
think
clearly
preempted
and
occupied
by
congress
in
the
federal
legislation.
but
what
we
have
here
then
is
an
illustration,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
of
the
importance
from
a
national
point
of
view.
the
importance
from
a
national
point
of
view
of
the
policies
laid
down
in
nelson,
because
the
wisdom
of
nelson
was
never
more
apparent.
if
nelson
is
undermined,
if
a
concurrent
jurisdiction
is
permitted
to
louisiana,
not
only
in
louisiana,
in
mississippi
and
alabama,
this
court
had
a
similar
statute
up
and
forward
in
stanford
from
texas
all
through
the
deep
southeast
statutes
are
there.
now,
if
the
selective
enforcement
which
louisiana
proposes,
which
they
tell
us,
they
tell
us
they're
going
to
do.
next
is
martin
luther
king's
southern
christian
leadership
conference
and
the
students
of
the
student
nonviolent
coordinating
committee.
now,
if
these
statutes
are
permitted
to
be
used
because
louisiana
believes
their
voting
movement
is
a
communist
conspiracy.
it's
permitted
to
be
used
against,
against
the
civil
rights
movement
then
you
have
the
sharpest
conflict
with
national
policy
and
i
would
suggest
the
sharpest
danger
to
the
national
interest
because
if
the
national
security
lines
in
any
one
thing
at
this
moment
this
court
has
said,
the
president
has
said,
the
congress
has
said
and
it
lies
in
the
full
and
fair
and
pre-enforcement
of
the
voting
provisions
in
the
south.
now,
this
court
will
face
tomorrow,
united
states
against
louisiana
which
i
suggest
is
the
other
side
of
the
coin
of
this
situation.
because
what
is
the
good
of
striking
down
unconstitutional
voting
laws
in
louisiana,
if
you
permit
the
people
who
in
light
must
enforce
these
laws,
who
must
go
to
the
post
to
register,
who
must
take
the
courage
in
their
hands
and
it
takes
courage
in
the
south
today.
and
the
headline
showed
that
area
to
area.
what
good
does
it
do
to
strike
the
laws
down
if
on
the
other
hand
we
are
to
permit
the
harassment,
the
intimidation,
the
deterring
of
the
utilization
of
the
first
amendment
liberties
which
are
so
essential
to
enforce
these
laws.
now,
i
would
suggest
that
this
problem,
we
don't
have
a
series
of
conceptual
problems
here
or
preemption
of
abstention
of
equity
jurisdiction.
they
all
boil
down
to
one
thing
because
the
key
to
the
solution
of
the
conceptual
problems,
i
suggest
to
the
court
on
abstention
on
federal
power
lies
in
the
nature
of
the
right
involved.
the
nature
of
the
fact
that
what
is
here
before
the
court
is
the
protection
of
first
amendment
liberties,
the
deterrent
impact
of
an
overly
broad
statute
or
a
statute
including
in
a
field
occupied
by
congress.
now,
as
judge
wisdom
points
out
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
it's
extraordinary
to
suggest
that
a
federal
district
court
doesn't
have
power
in
a
situation
like
this.
it's
extraordinary
to
dismiss
this
complaint
out
of
hand
and
it's
interesting
in
this
respect.
at
one
point,
the
entire
rationale
of
the
majority
breaks
down.
they
have
no
difficulty
whatsoever
in
ruling
on
preemption
as
judge
wisdom
points
out
the
contradiction
in
their
rationale.
but
it
was
clear
when
it
got
to
the
question
of
preemption,
you
could
not
argue
that
there
was
any
point
to
deferring
to
a
state
court
in
ruling
on
the
question
of
preemption
or
classic
federal
question
governed
by
the
supremacy
clause,
therefore,
there
was
no
at
the
slightest
shred
of
reason.
and
without
explaining
it
--
without
explaining
it
they
rule
on
preemption.
they
had
to.
our
opponents
don't
even
suggest.
it
wasn't
proper
for
them
to
rule
on
preemption.
the
nelson
case
is
squarely
before
the
court.
nobody
argues
that
anybody
should
have
deferred
on
that.
but
i
suggest
that
the
precisely
same
principle
applies
to
the
question
of
the
first
amendment
vagueness.
this
is
a
federal
issue.
in
our
federal,
abstention
means
nothing
unless
it's
treated
as
a
principle
of
committee
which
is
governing
federal-state
relationships.
if
there
is
anything
that
is
essential
in
federal-state
relationships,
it's
the
primacy
of
the
federal
court,
of
the
national
court
in
protecting
the
essential,
fundamental
national
right
which
makes
the
whole
system
work
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
first
amendment
rights,
the
protection
of
these
rights,
the
striking
down
of
these
statutes
are
essential
to
the
preservation
of
state
rights.
they're
essential
to
the
preservation
of
the
system
of
federal-state
relationships
because
the
answer
to
that,
i
think,
was
given
to
us
by
chief
justice
stone
in
discussing,
in
suggesting
that
the
very
special
character
of
the
first
amendment
right
flows
from
the
fact
that
it
is
the
fundamental
guarantee
of
the
people
of
its
control
over
institutions.
now,
if
you're
going
to
give
a
state
autonomy
within
a
federal-state
system
there
must
be
the
fundamental
controls
over
that
state
which
our
system
of
government
calls
for.
and
those
fundamental
controls
are
the
pre-exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.
that's
the
ultimate
guarantee
that
the
people
will
control
the
state,
federal
--
the
federal
government
of
the
state.
and
when
a
state
clogs
up
the
channels
by
deterring
the
exercise
of
these
rights
by
what
i
suggest
is
the
most
incredibly
broad
statute
this
court
has
ever
faced,
then
it
is
the
duty
of
a
federal
district
court,
the
duty
of
a
federal
district
court
to
intervene
under
the
system
of
federal-state
relationships
because
the
preservation
of
these
rights
are
the
first
obligation
of
the
federal
district
court.
now,
we
ask
this
court,
we
ask
this
court
to
reaffirm
the
duty
and
obligation
of
the
federal
district
courts.
otherwise,
we
say
to
the
court,
we
will
face
an
extraordinarily
serious
situation
in
the
south
today.
we
will
face
the
closing
down
of
the
only
available
tribunals
left
to
us
to
reaffirm
and
protect
fundamental
federal
rights.
this
court
knows
that.
the
fifth
circuit
has
been
struggling
with
that
for
the
last
three
years.
judge
wisdom
states
it
in
the
most
eloquent
terms
to
this
court,
if
the
federal
district
courts
are
permitted
to
turn
abstention
on
its
head,
if
they
are
permitted
to
take
comment
into
a
license
to
advocate
federal
responsibility,
if
they
are
permitted
to
take
douglas
against
jeannette
and
turn
it
into
a
total
application
of
federal
equity
jurisdiction.
if
they
are
permitted
to
take
nelson
and
put
it
on
the
shelf,
then
they
are
saying
that
the
doors
of
the
federal
district
courts
in
the
south
are
closed
--
are
closed
for
protection,
are
closed
for
relief.
now,
if
we
say
to
the
negro
people
in
the
south,
if
we
say
this
is
a
system
of
law
and
you
will
obtain
your
objectives
through
the
processes
of
law,
we,
the
bar,
the
courts,
have
our
own
special
obligation
and
that
is
to
see
that
the
tribunals
remain
open
because
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
--
if
the
approach
taken
by
west
and
now
it's
below
and
other
federal
district
judges
that
this
court
is
well
aware
out
of
mississippi,
out
of
alabama,
out
of
louisiana,
if
these
approaches
permitted
to
stand
then
the
federal
tribunal
in
the
most
critical
of
cases
is
closed,
and
what
do
we
say?
where
do
you
turn?
where
do
you
go?
where
do
you
find
the
relief
which
a
system
of
law
is
designed
to
protect
us?
we
ask
the
court
for
relief
in
this
case.
