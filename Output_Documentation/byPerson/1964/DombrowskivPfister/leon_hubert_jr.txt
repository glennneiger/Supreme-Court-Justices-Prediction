mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
under
28
u.s.c.
1253,
from
a
judgment
of
a
three-judge
court
denying
the
appellant's
application
for
an
injunction
to
strain
the
enforcement
of
three
acts
of
the
state
of
louisiana
contained
in
the
--
our
criminal
code,
title
xiv,
sections
358
through
374,
384
through
385
and
390
and
the
following.
all
of
these
statutes
on
their
face
purport
to
deal
with
regulations
of
the
communist
or
subversive
parties.
the
three-judge
court
in
the
procedure
which
i
will
elaborate
on
in
a
minute
decided
against
us
with
the
vigorous
dissent
by
judge
wisdom
and
that
we
appeal
in
this
court
nor
the
jurisdiction
on
june
the
15th,
1964.
now,
before
going
into
the
actual
procedure,
i
would
like
to
say
who
the
appellants
are.
one
of
the
appellants
is
mr.
dombrowski
who's
the
president
of
the
southern
conference
educational
fund,
a
tennessee
corporation
whose
purpose
is
dedicated
to
anti-segregation
or
rather
in
favor
of
integration
movements.
mr.
ben
smith
an
attorney
at
law
and
member
of
this
court
who
was
actively
engaged
in
the
south
and
particularly
in
new
orleans
area
and
civil
rights
cases,
and
then
particularly
in
integration
cases
that
is
to
say
in
anti-segregation
cases.
he
also
happens
to
be
treasurer
of
the
organization,
southern
conference
educational
fund
which
i
referred
to
if
it
please
the
court,
as
scef
from
now
on
out.
and
mr.
bruce
waltzer
who
is
a
partner,
a
law
partner
of
mr.
ben
smith
and
is
also
engaged
in
a
practice
that
specializes
anti-segregation
matters.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
the
7th
(voice
overlap)
--
no
sir,
not
as
such
but
it
has
the
same
purposes
according
to
his
charter
and
according
to
the
statement
of
facts
alleged
in
the
petition
filed
here,
filed
in
the
local
court.
now,
in
1954,
just
after
the
decision
of
brown
in
this
court,
louisiana
created
a
joint
legislative
committee
and
also
passed
the
first
act
which
has
to
do
with
alleged
anti-segregation
or
rather
alleged
communist
activities.
it
required
then
solely
that
the
communist
party
and
communist-front
organizations
which
are
defined
in
the
statute
should
register
and
that
was
all
that
was
done
at
that
time
it
made
a
penalty
for
the
members
of
those
organizations
and
for
the
organizations
themselves
to
fail
to
register.
then
in
1962,
the
legislature
created
a
joint
committee
on
un-american
activities
and
at
the
same
time
it
passed
the
legislation
which
is
actually
before
this
court
now
which
is
a
combination
actually
of
the
earlier
statutes
and
i
will
have
the
occasion
in
a
moment
to
analyze
those
various
statutes.
now,
before
going
into
the
pleading
aspect
and
all
the
issues
that
are
brought
before
this
court,
i
think
it
would
be
well
for
me
to
state
certain
facts
which
however
are
part
of
the
record
and
therefore
officially
before
this
court.
as
i've
said,
mr.
smith
and
mr.
waltzer,
my
clients,
and
mr.
kinoy
by
the
way,
represent
mr.
dombrowski
and
we'll
share
the
--
our
argument
that
we
have
here.
mr.
smith
and
mr.
waltzer
have
been
engaged
in
anti-segregation
activities
in
the
new
orleans
area
and
all
over
the
south
for
several
years.
and
on
october
2nd
of
1963,
the
appellees,
pfister
who
was
chairman
of
the
un-american
activities
committee
of
louisiana
legislature,
rogers
who
is
the
attorney
follow
that
committee,
burbank
and
willie,
all
of
them
were
defendants
in
this
case
who
were
police
officers
of
the
state
police
department,
and
the
governor
of
the
state
of
louisiana
and
the
attorney
general
and
the
district
attorney
of
orleans
parish,
all
made
defendants
in
this
case.
but
pfister
and
rogers
and
burbank
and
willie
got
a
search
warrant
from
a
judge
in
orleans
parish
and
using
that
search
warrant
and
also
a
warrant
of
arrest.
they
searched
the
offices,
the
homes
and
the
automobiles
of
my
clients
and
also
of
mr.
dombrowski
with
arms
in
downtown
new
orleans
at
3
o'clock
on
a
friday
afternoon
and
hold
off
from
their
offices
a
great
deal
of
the
material
including
private
litigants
files
which
in
fact
have
never
been
recovered
to
this
day.
now,
the
search
warrants
were
based
upon
the
statutes
involved
and
the
warrant
of
arrest
were
based
upon
the
statutes
before
this
court
today.
and
when
they
were
booked
following
the
arrest
at
the
police
station,
the
statutes
before
this
court
today
were
used
for
booking
purposes.
however,
after
this
arrest
and
our
client
was
able
to
get
out
on
bond
very
shortly.
after
this
arrest,
no
formal
charges
were
brought
against
our
clients.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
it
never
has
been
sir
to
this
moment.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
yes
sir.
the
proceeding
was
brought
to
suppress
it
and
it
was
ordered
to
suppress
as
a
matter
of
fact
but
that
is
on
appeal.
however,
that
comes
in
another
proceeding
because
that's
not
in
this
proceeding
yet.
i
will
--
i
will
explain
that
in
--
in
just
a
moment.
no
formal
charges
were
filed,
however,
and
as
a
result
of
that,
we
filed
an
application
for
preliminary
hearing
which
is
permissible
under
the
louisiana
law
and
the
judge
dismissed
all
of
the
arrests
but
did
not
turn
loose
the
evidence
at
that
time.
so
that
after
november
26
then
there
was
nothing
pending
except
that
the
material
seized
during
the
search
was
still
in
the
custody
of
the
committee
of
which
mr.
pfister
was
then
a
chairman
and
of
which
mr.
rogers
was
the
attorney.
on
november
the
8th,
1963
however,
mr.
pfister
held
a
committee
meeting
in
baton
rouge
in
which
he
took
selected
portions
of
the
material
seized,
placed
them
in
the
record
which
the
state
has
made
part
of
this
case
by
its
exhibit
c
attached
to
its
brief
which
is
a
report
of
november
8th,
over
the
activities
of
november
8,
report
number
4
as
a
matter
of
fact.
and
he
also
announced
at
that
time
that
he
was
going
to
call
upon
the
district
attorney
of
the
parish
of
orleans
as
of
november
the
8th
to
institute
prosecutions
and
he
was
going
to
turnover
this
material
to
the
district
attorney
of
orleans
or
at
least
make
it
available
to
him.
well,
on
november
the
12th,
mr.
dombrowski
alone
at
that
time,
fearful
that
the
statutes
would
be
used
against
him,
however,
filed
a
petition
asking
for
a
three-judge
court
in
the
federal
district
court
in
orleans
parish
and
it
was
convened,
judge
ellis,
judge
west
and
a
circuit
judge,
judge
john
minor
wisdom,
composed
the
court.
at
that
time,
that
was,
say
on
november
the
12th
mr.
dombrowski
did
not
ask
for
a
restraining
order
but
asked
if
the
statutes
be
declared
unconstitutional
as
for
declaratory
judgment
also
and
asked
if
the
statutes
were
not
unconstitutional
upon
their
face
that
leads
the
procedures
involved
that
the
administrative
manner
of
handling
and
enforcing
the
statutes
should
be
declared
to
be
improper
and
unconstitutional.
and
that
was
done
on
november
the
12th.
however,
on
november
the
15th,
the
judge
who
was
then
in
charged
of
the
grand
jury
in
new
orleans
convened
the
grand
jury
as
these
statutes
required
them
to
do
and
charge
them
with
respect
to
their
duty
--
with
respect
to
the
statutes.
that
is
to
say
that
they
should
look
into
the
matter.
that
happened
on
a
friday,
november
the
15th
of
1963.
so
then
on
monday,
november
the
18th
of
1963,
mr.
dombrowski
asked
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
which
was
granted
and
which
had
the
effect
that
goes
of
halting
any
prosecution
at
least
at
that
time.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
it
did
so.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
well,
as
you
see,
the
criminal
indictments
did
not
come
until
after
november
the
10th.
they
came
on
the
22nd.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
well,
what
happened
to
them
is
this.
in
the
case
of
dombrowski,
there
was
a
motion
to
suppress
filed
and
also
the
plea
of
res
judicata
which
--
both
of
which
were
upheld
by
the
lower
court
on
june
the
15th
of
1964.
the
state
of
louisiana
has
taken
an
appeal
which
has
suspended
the
judge.
with
respect
to
this
indictment
against
smith,
there
was
a
motion
to
quash
file
but
it
was
not
argued
and
it's
in
the
bench
as
to
well,
say
nothing
has
been
done
there.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
sort
of
a
gentlemen's
agreement
on
the
matter
that
nothing
will
be
done
until
this
court
speaks.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
it
didn't
quash
the
indictment.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
the
motion
to
quash
was
filed
but
it
has
not
even
been
argued,
it's
just
being
held
in
events.
now,
in
the
dombrowski
case,
the
motion
to
suppress
was
upheld
and
the
plea
of
res
judicata
was
upheld
too
but
that
--
those
--
both
of
those
are
on
appeal
now
in
this
--
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
what's
that
sir?
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
plea
of
res
judicata,
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
well,
actually
it
was
upon
the
fact
that
there
was
a
hearing
on
october
the
26th,
you
see
which
have
the
effect
of
adjudging
the
question.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
no,
on
the
merits
and
--
and
on
the
suppression
as
well
too.
but
in
any
case,
those
merits
are
on
appeal
right
now.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
no
sir.
it
does
not
mean
that.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
because
of
the
fact
that
of
--
of
a
gentlemen's
agreement
that
we're
not
proceeding
at
--
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
it's
--
all
it
does
is
say
that
the
evidence
may
not
be
produced,
that's
all.
and
the
plea
of
res
judicata
has
no
effect
on
that
either
so
that
the
only
reason
why
the
state
can
proceed
in
this
--
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
the
indictment
is
still
there
but
the
state
may
not
use
the
evidence
which
has
been
seized.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
well,
in
any
case
--
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
the
premise
was
that
on
october
26,
there
was
a
hearing
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
there
was
any
evidence
to
warrant,
keeping
these
men
under
arrest
--
not
actually
under
arrest
but
on
the
bond.
and
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
and
therefore
dismiss
the
warrant
of
arrest
and
that's
what
--
that's
what
that's
about.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
indictment
at
all
because
the
indictment
wasn't
in
existence
at
the
time
that
the
october
26
hearing
was
held.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
well,
the
indictments
for
failing
to
register
and
for
also
becoming
and
remaining
and
participating
in
subversive
organizations
and
of
course
i
will
get
to
the
analysis
to
the
statutes
in
just
a
moment.
i
might
pause
for
a
moment
to
state
what
happened
next.
on
december
the
4th,
the
district
attorney
garrison
of
new
orleans
filed
his
answer
to
the
plea
--
to
the
petition
for
injunction
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
in
paragraph
2
of
his
petition
which
is
at
page
13
of
the
transcript,
he
states
that
scef,
the
organization
which
we
have
charged
with
belonging
to
and
being
a
member
of
the
registry
is
a
subversive
organization
and
that
i
think
becomes
important
in
just
a
moment.
in
any
case
on
december
the
9th,
smith
and
waltzer,
my
clients,
fearing
also
that
they
were
going
to
be
prosecuted
under
these
acts,
intervened
in
the
lawsuit
which
was
then
pending
between
dombrowski
and
the
other
defendants
and
this
intervention
was
allowed.
on
december
the
9th,
there
was
an
argument
which
was
restricted
at
the
time
by
the
court
to
the
validity
of
the
statutes
on
its
face,
on
their
face.
then
at
the
end
of
that
hearing,
the
court
by
two
to
one
without
a
written
opinion
at
that
time
stated
that
they
thought
that
the
statutes
were
valid
on
their
face.
but
that
they
plead
a
minute
at
that
time
the
question
of
whether
the
administration
of
those
statutes
violated
any
constitutional
provision
and
set
an
argument
for
that
on
january
10th
of
1964.
now,
i
might
say
that
the
arguments
concerning
the
validity
of
the
statutes
are
the
same
arguments
that
we
make
here
today
so
that
they
were
properly
raised
in
the
lower
court
and
that
is
to
say
the
first
amendment's
right
and
violates
the
fifth
amendment
rights
and
also
the
preemption
of
supersession
doctrine
under
the
nelson
case.
well,
on
january
10th
when
the
matter
came
for
a
hearing,
the
court
decided
that
the
statutes
were
valid
but
that
it
was
not
going
to
hear
or
it
was
not
going
to
hear
any
evidence
at
all
with
respect
to
the
administration
of
the
statutes.
the
court
did
allow,
however,
an
offer
of
proof
to
be
made
and
that
offer
of
proof
is
of
course
contained
in
our
brief
and
in
--
in
fact
in
the
facts
which
the
lower
court
or
in
the
--
in
our
brief,
it's
--
repeat
the
opinion.
no,
it's
on
the
transcript,
they're
regularly
on.
they
accept
the
facts
as
alleged
by
us
which
on
in
itself
makes
up
we
think
the
cause
of
action
because
we
alleged
in
our
petition
and
it's
admitted
that
this
organization,
scef
is
mainly
engaged
and
solely
engaged
in
fact
in
anti-segregation
activities
and
that
we
have
been
harassed
individually
and
as
an
organization
because
of
those
activities
in
new
orleans
and
in
the
whole
southern
area.
the
fact
that
those
facts
are
admitted
is
also
a
matter
of
procedure
and
that
the
answer
of
all
of
the
defendants
except
mr.
garrison
was
plead
to
the
jurisdiction
and
also
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
a
failure
to
state
the
cause
of
action
which
of
course
has
to
admit
the
truth
of
the
facts
that
are
involved.
now,
when
the
opinions
--
when
january
10th
came
and
the
court
then
denied
as
relief
of
any
sought
and
denied
a
stay
order,
the
state
prosecuted
the
three
defendants
and
i
think
it's
worthy
for
a
moment
see
what
prosecutions
were
about
although
i
mentioned
it
just
a
moment
ago,
these
prosecutions
occurred
on
the
22nd
and
25th
of
january.
so
that
was
just
a
short
period
of
time
that
elapsed
actually
before
the
indictments
came
out.
mr.
dombrowski
was
indicted
for
being
a
member,
the
president
of
a
subversive
organization
to
which
scef
which
it
says,
was
not
itself
cited
by
the
board
such
as
the
attorney
general
or
the
u.s.
control
board
or
any
subcommittee
or
committee
of
the
house
of
representatives
but
it
was
the
same
as
another
committee
which
is
not
perfect
here
except
that
it
draw
some
light
upon
how
the
statute
is
being
administered.
in
any
case,
the
second
count
in
the
indictment
against
dombrowski
was
for
failure
to
register
as
a
member
of
scef
when
they're
part
of
the
statute.
now,
as
to
smith,
he
was
indicted
in
the
same
way
except
that
he
was
indicted
count
as
to
him
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
national
lawyers
guild,
an
organization
that
has
been
cited
by
the
subcommittee
of
the
congress.
and
as
to
waltzer,
the
indictment
as
to
him
is
simply
that
he
is
a
member
of
the
national
lawyers
guild
because
he
has
no
--
he
did
not
--
he
was
not
a
me
--
member
or
an
officer
at
least
of
scef.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
should
like
at
this
moment
to
analyze
the
statutes
that
are
involved
here
because
we
are
asking
this
court
as
we
did
in
the
court
below
and
declare
that
those
statutes
of
unconstitutional
on
their
face.
we
invoke
baggett
versus
bullitt
which
was
decided
by
this
court
last
june.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
only
as
to
one
case
sir,
dombrowski.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
the
appeal
is
on
the
motion
to
suppress,
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
motion
to
quash
the
indictment.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
that
has
not
been
ruled
or
found
even
by
the
lower
court.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
that's
correct
sir.
the
state
courts
and
the
--
and
the
prosecuting
attorneys,
i
would
say
the
district
attorney
and
the
attorney
general
are
doing
so.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
yes
indeed.
that
is
of
course
an
important
facet
of
our
argument
and
that
is
to
say
that
we
need
this
relief
and
we
need
it
right
now.
it's
not
fanciful
as
mr.
justice
white
said
in
bullitt
versus
baggett.
what
we're
facing
here
is
not
conjectural
at
all.
we
have
been
indicted.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
well,
because
of
the
fact
that
as
those
argument
--
those
cases
may
be
disposed
of
in
the
court
below
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
not
raise
these
questions
and
not
settled.
suppose
for
instance
we
have
quitted
as
we
think
we
would
be
or
suppose
there
were
reversal
on
some
other
point.
of
course,
actually
if
there
were
reversal
on
the
ground
that
the
statutes
were
unconstitutional,
we
would
reach
this
point.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
oh
yes,
yes.
it
is
indeed.
the
statutes
that
contained
in
appendix
a
of
our
brief
which
is
the
white
brief,
and
the
--
the
first
statute,
the
preamble,
identifies
the
organization,
the
communist
movement
in
such
language
as
to
indicate
that
it
condemns
any
organization
whose
purpose
is
to
overthrow
by
revolution,
force
or
violence
the
organization
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
the
definitions
are
contained
in
section
359
and
the
important
ones
of
course
are
communist-front
organization
which
is
in
section
3
of
359
and
section
5
of
359
which
is
subversive
organization.
now,
of
course
the
penal
parts,
the
things
that
really
reach
us
and
that
is
because
those
are
the
ones
that
use
the
language
which
have
been
condemned
in
bullitt
versus
baggett
as
being
too
vague
to
these
statutes
or
to
stand
up
against
the
test
of
free
speech
in
this
country.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
pitch
of
our
argument
is
that
in
louisiana
today,
even
a
lawyer
has
to
run
this
risk.
he
can
remain
still
and
that's
really
the
only
safe
thing
for
him
to
do
or
he
can
take
a
chance
and
he
can
take
a
chance
of
having
to
rebut
a
presumption
which
is
created
by
section
3
in
defining
a
communist-front
organization
and
we
have
been
indicted
for
belonging
to
the
communist-front
organization
or
the
state
says
that
“well,
it's
easy
enough.
all
we
have
to
do
is
rebut
this
presumption
because
it's
not
conclusive.”
and
of
course,
what
they're
saying
is
to
us,
“all
you
have
to
do
is
to
rebut
it
in
a
criminal
prosecution.”
but
we
are
suggesting
that
free
speech
means
more
than
that.
you
don't
have
to
run
the
risk
of
having
to
rebut
a
presumption
in
a
criminal
prosecution
and
you
ought
to
be
able
to
invoke
the
aid
of
a
three-judge
court
to
stop
even
that
burden.
now
--
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
no
sir,
they
have
not
been,
except
in
one
instance.
in
the
case
of
state
versus
jenkins
right
after
the
nelson
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
was
the
district
attorney
then
instituted
prosecution
and
the
state
declared
that
nelson
was
controlling
and
therefore
threw
it
out
to
the
louisiana
statute
out
but
it
was
reenacted
in
the
light
of
the
uphaus
case
to
eliminate
all
reference
to
the
united
states
of
america
and
to
direct
its
pitch
to
protecting
the
state
of
louisiana
alone
which
it
is
claimed
that
it
was
roomed
for
under
the
decision
of
uphaus
versus
wyman.
that
is
another
point
really
in
the
--
before
this
court
too
in
which
mr.
kinoy
will
handle.
i
know
that
my
time
is
going.
let
me
say
this.
we
rely
upon
bullitt
versus
baggett.
we
see
--
do
not
see
that
the
case
is
--
are
indistinguishable.
the
same
words
that
we
attack
here
were
under
attack
there.
there
was
such
a
word
as
subversive,
such
a
word
as
counsel,
aid
and
if
that
such
word
as
knowledge.
i
think
mr.
justice
white
asked,
“what
knowledge
must
a
man
have?”
what
must
he
anticipate
or
he
can
do
or
in
other
words,
there
is
a
matter
here
that
the
words
themselves
even
the
lawyers,
what
is
subversive?
you
see,
it
defined
here
as
a
threat
to
overthrow
by
a
revolution
or
anyone
who
teaches
or
advocates,
abets,
advices,
the
overthrow
by
revolution,
force,
violence
or
unlawful
means,
that
was
dealt
with
too
in
bullitt
versus
baggett
because
there
this
court
said
that
revolution
--
peaceful
revolution
is
not
prohibited
and
that
any
statute
which
leave
some
doubt
as
to
whether
peaceful
revolution
change
as
it
were.
the
advocacy
of
peaceful
change,
of
peaceful
constitutional
amendments
of
a
radical
nature
could
even
be
forbidden
under
these
circumstances.
we
think
the
same
words
are
involved.
we
think
the
same
philosophy
is
involved.
we
think
that
the
same
distinctions
which
the
bullitt
case
made
as
to
other
cases.
thus,
the
gerende
case
was
distinguished
by
mr.
justice
white
and
also
the
dennis
case
was
distinguished.
it
seems
to
me
that
those
distinctions
apply
here
too.
furthermore,
there
is
involved
the
question
of
association
that
is
prohibited
in
violation
of
aptheker
which
was
decided
last
june.
there
is
the
question
of
self-incrimination
because
this
statute
requires
that
you
register
and
when
you
register,
you're
saying
that
you're
a
member
of
a
subversive
organization.
and
when
you
say
you're
a
member
of
a
subversive
organization,
you
are
confessing
to
a
crime
of
felony
punishable
by
six
years
in
the
penitentiary.
we
say
also
that
the
presumption
itself
is
irrational
and
that
there
is
no
--
there
is
not
sufficient
connection
between
the
--
our
organization
and
the
communist
or
communist-front
organizations
that
are
involved.
now,
to
make
the
point
again,
these
are
not
fanciful
matters
at
all.
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
brief
of
the
state
in
which
it
says
this.
mr.
leon
hubert
jr.
it's
at
page
40
and
41,
the
bottom
of
40
and
top
of
41.
this
is
the
attorney
general
of
louisiana
who
is
stating
what
he
thinks
has
happened
in
this
case.
what
he
thinks
our
clients
have
done
and
what
he
thinks
the
statute
does.
it
says,
legislative
inquiry
in
louisiana
is
led
to
a
determination
that
appellants
are
in
fact
operating
a
communist-front
organization
which
is
clearly
within
the
provisions
of
this
act.
therefore,
when
the
state
tells
you
that
being
a
member
of
a
communist-front
organization
is
not
a
violation
of
the
statute,
that's
contrary
to
their
own
analysis
and
understanding
of
the
statute.
furthermore,
to
go
on,
congress
and
legislative
investigation
to
this
organization
both
before
and
after
the
action
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
these
were
pure
communist
functions
that
the
--
our
plans
were
doing
purely
communistic
things
“such
as
defending
the
12
communist
convicted
under
the
smith
act
petitioning
for
clemency
--
well,
communist,
and
open
cooperation
with
several
well
other
identified
communist-front
organizations.”
so
there's
no
doubt
about
it
that
so
far
as
the
attorney
general
is
concerned,
these
statutes
are
subversive
statutes
that
is
to
say
that
--
that
scef
is
a
subversive
organization.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we've
been
indicted
for
it
as
such.
the
point
we
make,
therefore,
is
that
we
have
been
indicted
on
the
statutes
which
fall
within
the
scope
and
breadth
and
ambit
of
baggett
versus
bullitt.
we've
seen
no
distinctions
between
the
two
and
we
respectfully
ask
the
court
that
the
constitutional
grounds
of
free
speech,
freedom
from
arrest
and
the
due
process
aspects
are
identical
in
both
cases,
and
that
analysis
of
the
statutes,
the
application
of
the
statutes
and
particular
the
fact
of
being
actually
indicted
would
show
that
the
statutes
do
suppress
free
speech,
free
association,
free
trial,
all
of
which
have
been
upheld
by
this
court.
and
actually,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
as
i
have
said
earlier
that
i
respectfully
suggest
that
a
lawyer
in
louisiana,
and
were
lawyers
to
as
to
run
a
terrible
risk
even
to
defend
clients,
and
that's
the
very
best
way
to
get
at
organizations
that
you
wish
to
suppress
for
duty
purposes
is
to
get
at
the
lawyers
who
represent
these
men,
because
there,
the
freedom
of
speech
is
of
a
specialized
thought.
if
an
organization
cannot
have
a
lawyer
who
can
speak
freely,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
is
more
of
a
violation
of
the
free
speech
and
if
it
was
simply
an
individual
as
something
about
that
that
is
insidious
even
more
than
a
plain
suppression
of
speech
by
an
ordinary
individual
getting
at
the
person
who
can
possibly
--
and
the
only
person
who
can
possibly
represent
you
if
you
wish
to
urge
civil
rights
in
louisiana,
getting
a
lawyer
is
the
very
best
way
to
get
at
the
organization
and
we
suggest
respectfully
that
the
cases
fall
within
the
full
ambit
of
bullitt
versus
baggett.
mr.
wisdom
--
judge
wisdom
thought
so
and
what
i
considered
to
be
a
brilliant
dissent
which
i'm
sure
the
court
will
take
into
account
which
he
argued
all
of
these
points
more
reluctantly,
i
will
assure
you
that
i
have
been
able
to.
