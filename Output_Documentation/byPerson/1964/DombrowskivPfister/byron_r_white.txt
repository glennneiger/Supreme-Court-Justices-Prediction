justice
byron
r.
white
what
happens
--
that
means
that
what
the
--
did
that
mean
that
the
indictment
is
quashed
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
the
state
may
not
proceed
on
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
--
what
was
the
--
the
plea
that
was
held
now
barred?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
are
the
indictments
for,
for
failing
to
register?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
be
--
would
you
be
quite
satisfied
in
this
case
with
declaratory
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
relief
you
ask
for
and
the
relief
you
seek
here
is
an
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
white
lawyer
is
a
communist?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
white
--
what
if
the
white
lawyer
is
a
communist,
does
the
state
not
--
not
entitled
to
enforce
its
subversive
laws
against
that
person
because
he
is
actually
representing
civil
rights
organization?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
only
answer
though
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
tell
me
what
a
--
can
you
tell
me
what
a
--
the
communist-front
organization
is
in
louisiana?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
just
tell
me
what
a
communist-front
organization
is
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
this
quoted?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
a
communist
action
organization?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
any
definition
of
that
in
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
there
ever
been
any
court
in
louisiana
ever
said
what
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
attorney
general
overruled
what
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
would
anybody
know
what
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
what
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
force.
justice
byron
r.
white
any
kind
of
forceful
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
any
kind
of
forceful
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
a
communist
infiltrated
organization?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
a
communist
infiltrated
organization
isn't
defined
in
the
statute
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
nor
a
communist
controlled
organization?is
there
any
difference
between
an
infiltrated
and
a
controlled
organization?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
didn't
know
whether
to
register
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
what
they've
been
indicted
for,
isn't
it,
failing
to
register
two
counts
for
being
a
member
of
a
communist-front
organization.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
also
about
a
subversive
organization.
you
say
that
in
louisiana,
you
--
that
--
that
anyone
would
know
that
the
acts
which
are
directed
against
the
state
of
louisiana
must
be
aimed
at
overthrowing
the
state
by
force
or
violence.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
mean
that
--
and
not
just
some
vague
or
remote
threat
but
an
active
threat.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
statute,
however,
says
that
in
defining
subversive
organization
not
only
says
by
revolution
of
force
or
violence.
it
says
or
any
other
organization
which
seeks
by
unconstitutional
or
illegal
means
to
overthrow
or
destroy
the
government
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
it
doesn't
say
anything
at
all
about
force
or
violence.
now,
this
has
brought
any
kind
of
an
illegal
--
a
subversive
organization
is
any
organization
which
seeks
to
overthrow
the
government
of
louisiana
by
any
illegal
means
and
to
--
and
to
substitute
a
form
of
government
not
responsive
with
people.
now,
that
is
a
good
deal
broader
than
what
you
suggested
to
us
was
the
construction
that
would
be
placed
upon
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
it
says
yes,
violence
or
unlawful
means.
it
doesn't
require
violence
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
--
can
you
think
of
a
single
unlawful
--
can't
you
think
of
any
unlawful
means
which
doesn't
--
don't
involve
violence?
how
about
fraud?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
it
is
by
violence
or
any
other
thing
you
would
mean
the
same.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
doesn't
have
to
be
violent,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
forceful?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
--
could
you
tell
me
what
sections
of
louisiana
law
you
think
are
involved
here?
i
gather
from
your
brief
you
--
do
you
think
we
should
limit
any
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
any
examination
to
359,
3,
5
and
then
360
and
364,
4,
6
and
7,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
6.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
even
if
he
had
to
know
what
the
organization
is
engaged,
would
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
he
know
that?
you
said
you
wouldn't
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
he
might
have
infiltrated
this
why
no
one
knows
what
it
means.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
that
make
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
that
make
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
substantially
influence
upon.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
means
nothing
under
the
statute
i
gather.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
might
be
under
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
those
are
--
are
those
the
only
organizations
that
are
--
that
are
going
to
be
a
subject
in
the
statute,
just
the
ones
that
had
been
decided
by
some
federal
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
the
way
it
reads
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
the
way
the
statute
reads.
it
does
pre
--
in
the
presumptive
evidence
rule
but
that
wouldn't
need
to
be
the
only
evidence
you
relied
on
for
enforcing
for
failure
to
register
provisions
on
those.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
you
say
when
some
organization
has
been
cited
that
then
there
should
no
longer
be
any
doubt
in
anybody's
mind
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
were
some
vagueness
or
uncertainties
before
the
citation,
there
isn't
afterwards.
justice
byron
r.
white
they're
both
involved
in
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
that
mean
mr.
rogers
that
something
might
be
a
communist-front
organization
and
not
be
a
subversive
organization
or
vice
versa?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
--
but
not
necessarily
by
force
or
violence?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
in
this
instance,
the
indictment
suggest
that
this
organization
is
both
a
communist-front
and
subversive
organization.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
suggest
that
one
maybe
one
without
being
the
other.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it
does
provide
the
application,
what
do
you
suppose
the
difference
is
--
it
might
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
law
would
catch
those
as
far
as
registration
is
concerned.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
be
required
to
register
even
though
you're
a
member
of
this
study
group.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
--
but
it
could
be
a
--
it
could
be
a
communist-front
study
group
that
fell
far
short
of
satisfying
the
definitions
of
a
subversive
organization.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
suppose
anybody
would
really
or
to
really
--
or
to
really
expect
anybody
to
know
the
difference
between
a
subversive
organization
and
a
communist-front
organization
just
from
reading
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
that
doesn't
make
any
difference.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
exactly
before
lunch.
