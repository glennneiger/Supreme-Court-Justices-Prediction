mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
unfortunate
that
other
members
of
the
bar
involved
in
this
state
criminal
proceeding
and
i
sympathize
with
this
particular
situation
how
it
does
not
in
any
way,
manner,
shape
or
form
change
the
nature
of
the
issue
which
is
before
this
court
today.
and
this
is
a
question
of
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts.
this
matter
was
pointed
up
in
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
on
page
74
where
it
said,
“for
the
good
of
all,
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
this
case
will
reach
the
supreme
court
so
that
the
matter
of
state-federal
relations
and
the
judicial
field
may
be
clarified.
what
the
appellants
are
asking
you
to
do
here
today
is
to
allow
federal
intrusion
upon
a
state
criminal
proceeding
in
the
face
of
a
federal
statute
which
expressly
prohibits
such
intrusion.”
this
is
28
united
states
code
2283.
and
it
reads,
“a
court
of
the
united
states
may
not
grant
an
injunction
to
state
proceedings
in
a
state
court
except
as
expressly
authorized
by
act
of
congress
or
where
a
necessary
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction
or
to
protect
or
effectuate
its
judgments.”
now,
there
had
been
two
cases,
the
office
of
both
opinions
was
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
toucey
versus
new
york,
314
u.s.
118,
in
amalgamated
clothing
workers
versus
richman,
a
later
case
348
u.s.
511.
in
those
two
cases,
there
were
several
proceedings
involved
and
not
criminal
state
proceedings.
the
only
case
which
they
cite
in
which
this
particular
prohibition,
statutory
prohibition
is
not
involved
as
ex
parte
young.
ex
parte
young
was
a
matter
in
which
an
injunction
from
a
federal
court
had
issued.
a
state
attorney
general
in
the
face
of
that
injunction
went
and
fall
in
a
mandamus
proceeding
and
they
found
them
in
contempt
of
that
particular
federal
court.
in
the
light
of
the
sequence
of
the
events
which
have
transpired
in
the
matter,
how
could
these
appellants
feel
that
there
was
no
doubt
that
there
were
state
criminal
proceedings
pending
and
initiated
on
october
the
2nd,
1963
when
search
warrants
and
arrest
warrants
were
issued
by
the
courts,
criminal
courts.
as
result
of
that,
an
execution
of
search
warrants
and
the
warrants
of
arrest,
these
were
executed
on
october
the
4th,
1963.
on
october
the
25th,
these
appellants
went
into
the
criminal
district
court
within
our
state
and
asked
that
they
not
be
bound
over
for
trial,
that
there
was
no
evidence
justifying
the
issuance
of
the
arrest
warrants
and
the
state
district
court
agreed
with
them
and
they
were
discharged.
on
that
same
date,
the
district
attorney
or
his
chief
assistant
told
these
particular
appellants
that
these
matters
were
going
to
be
turned
over
to
the
grand
jury
for
the
state
to
continue
its
prosecution
in
these
matters.
then
--
and
the
appellants
well
--
well
aware
of
this
because
if
you'll
notice
in
the
record,
the
original
injunction
which
judge
wisdom
issued
by
way
of
motion,
they
named
in
this
particular
motion
as
well
as
in
the
times
of
order
of
injunction
which
did
formulated
for
the
judge's
signature.
the
judge
of
the
division
or
section
of
the
criminal
district
court,
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury
and
each
member
of
that
grand
jury.
and
truth
in
fact,
this
is
--
this
was
a
lawsuit
in
the
federal
court
against
--
it's
truly
against
the
state
of
louisiana
because
this
is
what
the
desire
the
judge
would
--
he
struck
the
name
of
the
judge,
the
criminal
district
judge
in
the
state.
he
struck
the
name
of
the
foreman
and
the
members
of
the
grand
jury
but
he
allowed
the
injunction
to
issue
against
the
governor
and
what
i'm
arguing
now
is
pointed
up
by
the
motion
to
dismiss
on
jurisdictional
grounds
filed
by
the
governor
which
the
court
is
considered
to
take
up
today
with
the
other
arguments
presented.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
yes
sir.
he
enjoined
--
he
did
not
enjoin
the
grand
jury,
it's
the
foreman
or
the
judge
who
was
conducting
that
grand
jury.
he
enjoy
--
enjoined
thoroughly
every
participation
by
any
state
official
in
connection
with
the
--
anything
that
might
be
presented
to
that
grand
jury.
so
he
--
they
--
he
effectively
enjoined
the
state
process
of
the
proceeding
which
was
pending
within
the
state
criminal
district
court,
he
effectively
enjoin
that.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
well,
they
could
--
nothing
could
be
presented
to
the
grand
jury
because
of
the
district
attorney's
hands,
he
was
enjoined.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
mr.
justice
goldberg,
that's
completely
correct.
when
judge
wisdom
issued
his
temporary
restraining
order
on
november
the
18th
then
the
proceedings
in
the
federal
district
court
were
taken
on
the
way.
and
then
upon
january
6th
or
7th,
they
vacated
the
temporary
restraining
order
and
thereafter,
the
district
attorney
took
the
evidence
which
he
had
down
to
the
grand
jury.
and
that
evidence
is
still
with
the
district
attorney
and
it's
a
part
of
the
criminal
proceeding
which
was
instituted
on
october
the
2nd,
1963
as
a
result
of
the
search
warrants
which
were
signed
by
the
judges
and
also
as
a
consequence
of
the
warrants
of
arrest
which
were
vacated.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
there's
not
doubt
about
that.
these
appellants
are
well
aware
that
they
went
into
the
federal
court
to
restrain
exactly
what
restrain
this
proceeding.
they
were
well
aware
of
that.
the
district
attorney
told
them,
“we're
taking
this
evidence
and
we're
going
to
put
it
before
the
grand
jury
and
we're
going
to
continue
with
our
proceeding.
and
of
course
appellants
want
you
to
think
that
the
indictment
is
the
same
thing.
without
an
indictment,
there's
no
proceeding.”
but
as
in
the
uphaus
it
would
really
be
a
race
to
the
federal
courthouse,
between
the
federal
courthouse
and
the
state
courthouse,
if
someone
got
to
win
that
they
are
going
to
be
prosecuted
by
the
state
and
could
beat
the
first
person
down
to
sign
an
affidavit
of
the
state,
beat
him
to
the
federal
court
before
he
got
to
the
state
courthouse.
but
there
is
no
doubt
about
this,
they
have
accepted
this.
the
indictments
came
down
and
then
mr.
dombrowski
went
before
judge
flat
and
asked
that
the
evidence
which
would
have
been
seized
in
--
on
october
4th
that
would
be
suppressed
as
far
as
his
proceeding
was
concerned
and
the
judge
granted
that.
in
the
meanwhile,
these
other
appellants
filed
certain
motions
in
their
particular
cases.
they
were
allotted
to
different
--
various
sections
of
the
criminal
district
court.
so
there's
no
doubt
that
they
were
not
aware
of
the
proceedings
that
were
actually
filed
on
the
record
in
the
criminal
district
court
in
new
orleans.
now,
as
soon
as
this
court,
judge
flat
granted
their
motion
to
suppress
or
mr.
dombrowski's
motion
to
suppress
on
june
12.
this
court
on
june
15th
noted
jurisdiction
at
that
time,
the
court
has
got
to
get
a
true
copy
of
the
mutual
agreement
and
we
said
we're
just
going
to
stay
these
things.
the
state
took
an
appeal
from
the
judge's
decision
to
suppress
the
evidence
but
through
comment
and
agreement
--
this
--
this
will
go
to
the
state
--
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
yes
sir.
now
in
--
of
course
i
take
serious
objection
to
appellants
saying
in
so
many
words
and
by
innuendo
that
they're
not
going
to
receive
due
process
from
the
courts
of
louisiana.
i'm
not
talking
about
any
other
state
but
louisiana
i'm
very
concerned
with
that.
the
history
of
this
type
of
litigation,
in
communist
control
in
state
versus
jenkins,
they
followed
the
nelson
case
and
declared
the
state
statute
unconstitutional.
so
that
there's
no
reason
to
suspect
that
but
the
main
--
the
main
issue
in
this
case
is
that,
these
state
criminal
proceedings
were
on
the
way
on
october
the
2nd.
the
appellants
knew
it
and
they
cannot
--
cannot
overcome
this
because
the
statute
is
completely
expressed.
and
the
two
decisions
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
of
course
which
some
of
the
court
did
not
go
along
with
but
these
two
of
the
latest
decisions
--
the
decisions
they
cite
and
this
is
not
a
question
of
the
court
in
its
exercise
of
equitable
relief
of
abstention.
this
is
a
question
of
law
expressed
statute
which
says
and
forbids.
this
is
the
way
the
congress
determined
that
our
federal-state
court
relation
should
be
set
up.
they
said
expressly
that
no
federal
court
shall
stay
state
court
proceedings.
and
toucey
points
that
up,
and
toucey
was
not
even
a
criminal
proceeding.
toucey
was
a
man
in
which
there
had
been
some
preli
--
suit
filed
in
the
federal
court
on
an
insurance
claim.
the
court
came
down
with
a
decision,
it
was
a
subsequent
suit
filed
in
the
state
court
and
they
said
we're
going
to
go
back
into
the
federal
court
and
join
the
state
court
civil
proceeding
because
it's
--
it
already
has
been
adjudicated
previously
in
the
federal
court.
in
the
second
case,
in
richman,
there's
a
question
of
taft-hartley.
and
this
--
this
was
another
civil
proceeding
and
they
tried
to
enjoin
a
state
court
civil
proceeding
trying
to
restrain
the
state
court
permission
of
an
injunction
and
the
court
in
this
case
realized
that
the
state
court
was
totally
without
jurisdiction
in
an
area
in
which
they
had
no
business
operating
whatsoever.
but
regardless
of
that
recognition,
they
said
that
under
this
statute
as
interpreted,
this
court
or
no
federal
court
has
the
right
to
come
in
and
enjoin
proceedings
already
on
the
way
in
view
of
what
the
congress
has
said.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
the
one
you
have
--
there
they
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment
but
declaratory
judgment
does
not
add
to
anything
with
the
jurisdiction.
they
do
not
--
they
ask
--
this
is
one
of
the
things
they
asked
after
having
tried
to
established
jurisdiction,
they
ask
for
declaratory
judgment.
what
they
ask
for
and
this
--
and
this
is
another
thing.
that
jurisdiction
is
on
the
jurisdictional
amount,
monetary
amount
and
the
only
relief
they
ask
for
is
an
injunction.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
baggett
and
bullitt,
mr.
rogers
is
going
to
answer
this
further.
with
baggett
and
bullitt,
there
was,
i
think
an
area
although
i
disagree
with
the
opinion
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
there
wasn't
any
area
of
interpretation.
i
think
it
meant
active
participation
under
the
terms
they've
both
--
announced
by
this
court
down
from
scales
and
the
rest
of
the
cases.
but
there's
no
doubt
in
louisiana
statute.
it's
not
a
crime
to
be
a
communist
but
you
have
to
register
if
you
are.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
on
a
procedural
part
(voice
overlap)
there
was
no
criminal
--
there
was
no
criminal
proceeding
in
bullitt
versus
baggett
and
simply
the
entire
issue
is
over
the
signing
of
an
oath
and
if
you
didn't
sign
the
oath
perhaps
there
is
a
professor
who
will
screw
and
you
lose
your
job.
there
was
no
criminal
proceeding
and
i
might
add
and
i'm
sure
mr.
rogers
is
going
to
point
this
out
that
the
only
way
a
criminal
sanction
maybe
imposed
under
the
louisiana
state
statute
is
through
a
judicial
process
by
a
court
of
law
in
louisiana,
the
court
having
found
a
state
successful
in
his
prosecution.
that's
the
only
way.
it's
not
something
of
--
there
is
no
crime
to
be
a
communist.
now,
if
you
are
a
communist
or
a
member
of
--
you
must
register
but
the
court
has
approved
that
in
--
in
the
communist
case.
but
it's
based
on
overt,
active
--
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
yes,
originally
it
was
in
the
gerende
case.
it
was
based
but
louisiana
statute
is
actually
three
enactments,
the
1952
statute
and
1954
statute.
they
were
declared
unconstitutional
by
the
state
court
in
the
verse
of
nelson
from
this
court.
then
in
1962,
in
view
of
all
of
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
statute
was
revamped
and
it
complied
with
all
of
the
announcements
of
this
court
until
that
time
and
then
went
through
and
directed
the
--
with
uphaus
in
mind,
scales
and
the
penal
section
of
the
louisiana
statute
itself
says,
you
must
know
knowingly
and
willingly
do
these
things.
there's
no
measure
of
vagueness
as
to
what
a
person
will
--
what
is
conduct.
the
--
the
penalized
conduct
under
the
statute
is.
there's
no
area
for
him
to
say
that
if
i
just
teach
in
the
common
definition
of
it
then
i'm
going
to
be
condemned
under
the
statute.
it's
very
clear,
it's
expressed.
the
statute
is
being
applied
to
the
indictments
themselves
and
what
must
be
proven
in
those
indictments,
reading
of
those
indictments,
they're
supplied
in
the
appendix
of
the
appellants
brief.
but
it's
very
clear.
it's
willful,
active,
knowing
conduct
which
has
been
approved
by
this
court.
there
is
no
area
of
peaceful
revolution.
it
must
be
forced,
unlawful
force
for
the
overthrow
of
the
state
government,
the
state
government
alone.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
the
--
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
yes
sir.
yes
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
have
prepared
--
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
oh,
yes
--
oh,
yes
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
was
only
in
one
case
as
i
recall
and
that
was
filed
and
the
decision
of
the
court
was
made
in
mr.
dombrowski's
case
and
of
course
it
does
unless
he's
taken,
supply
other
evidence
to
go
home
with
its
prosecution
and
yet
--
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
if
the
appeal
fail
(voice
overlap)
because
now,
the
evidence
which
was
seized
in
that
october
4th
raid
can
be
used.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's
all
up
to
the
district
attorney.
he'd
have
to
weigh
this
case
and
see
what
--
what
chances
he
thought
he
have
without
this
evidence
as
a
basis
of
the
state's
prosecution.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
your
honor,
nothing
has
been
done
under
this
so-called
gentlemen's
agreement.
the
appeal
is
there,
it
has
not
been
lodged
and
nothing
has
been
--
in
fact,
when
this
court
know
the
jurisdiction
on
june
the
15th,
no
further
action
was
taken
by
the
state
in
this
matters
pending
in
state
courts.
no
further
action
was
taken
by
the
appellants
in
those
cases
as
far
as
defense.
no
defense,
all
the
prosecutive
action
has
taken
whatsoever.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
yes
sir.
well,
the
motion
to
suppress
came
down
and
was
granted.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
and
then
the
state
took
an
appeal
and
then
this
court
noted
jurisdiction
and
then
that
is
stated
right
where
it
was.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
no
sir,
it
hasn't.
the
appeal
had
been
lodged.
it
has
not
been
perfected
and
it
has
not
been
heard.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
in
other
words,
the
decision
of
the
judge
came
down
in
the
district
court.
the
notices
of
appeal
were
filed
there
and
it
just
--
that
was
held
in
advance
until
this
court
finally
disposes.
mr.
john

yes
sir.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
well,
sir,
the
communist-front
organization
is
declined
by
the
statute
itself.
the
definitions
of
the
statute
only
do
not
impinge
upon
the
penal
provisions.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
a
communist-front
organization
show
for
the
purpose
of
this
act
to
include
any
communist
action.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
this
is
on
page
2
(a).
it's
the
appendix
of
the
appellant's
brief.
it
is
the
printing
of
the
louisiana
statutes
involved.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
this
is
on
page

(a).
it's
page
2
of
appendix
a.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
a
communist-front
organization
shall
for
the
purpose
of
this
act
include
any
communist
action
organization
(voice

mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
sir?
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
this
is
--
of
course,
the
action
organization
is
a
communist
action
organization
--
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
no,
there
is
not
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
no,
it
never
had
--
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
well,
people
that
are
in
this
--
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
my
definition
of
a
communist
action
organization
is
one
dedicated
to
world
communism
by
action
and
force.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
by
force
--
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
--
illegal.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
any
unlawful
action
against
constituted
government
whether
it
would
be
in
the
sense
as
the
state.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
a
communist
infiltrated
organization
is
--
is
an
organization
in
which
opponent
surface
is
not
communistic
but
it
has
been
infiltrated
by
a
communist
so
as
to
control
that
organization's
actions
and
dictate
action
by
force
and
are
bound
to
overthrow
the
government.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
no
sir,
it's
not
defined.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
you
just
have
my
personal
opinion,
mr.
justice
white
(voice
overlap)
like
all
of
the
--
like
of
the
terms
--
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
well,
these
people,
if
there
were
--
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
well,
this
matter
in
courts
is
not
decisive
of
this
court's
action
but
in
the
reason
--
the
recent
regimen
of
lincoln,
a
case
of
the
district
--
court
of
appeals
of
washington.
you
approve
--
they
approved
certiorari
which
was
denied
the
same
similar
definition
of
communist-front
and
this
people
had
failed
to
register.
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
sought
to
have
them
raised
and
he
was
successful.
this
is
the
recent
case
and
i
will
give
you
the
citation
of
the
court
later
but
--
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
that
was
under
the
federal
statute
and
this
is
--
this
is
modeled
after
the
federal
statute.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
in
the
terminology.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
well,
a
communist-front
organization
includes
all
of
these
other
various
organizations.
it
is
true
that
the
statute
does
not
define
of
its
own
terms.
the
communist
still
--
infiltrated
a
communist
control.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
it's
a
--
it's
a
line
of
distinction
and
that
the
statutes
differed
and
not
to
further
define
those.
but
the
claims
are
clearly
under
the
statute
directed
toward
the
active
participation
and
it's
not
a
crime
--
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
white,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
active?
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
subversive
organization,
this
is
--
this
is
--
the
language
itself
talks
of
violence
and
unlawful
means
of
active
participation.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
unlawful
means
doesn't
require
violence
in
this
and
--
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
well,
of
course
but
unlawful
meaning
(voice
overlap)
that
against
the
constituted
law
and
government
of
the
state
and
whether
it's
by
design
or
lack
of
--
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
but
it's
an
active
moving
thing.
it's
not
just
peaceful
discussion
or
peaceful
revolution
of
that
type
of
thing.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
violent,
no
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
it
has
to
--
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice
harlan.
we
know
and
all
of
these
are
tied
down
to
the
facts
of
each
case
and
to
prove
which
is
necessary
to
obtain
a
conviction
and
all
of
these
take
the
willful
and
knowing
knowledge
of
the
person
and
commit,
attempt
to
commit
or
aid
in
the
commission
of
any
act
intended
to
overthrow
or
destroy
by
their
search
and
they
overthrow
a
destruction
of
the
constitutional
form
of
government
of
the
state
of
louisiana
or
any
political
subdivision
there
by
revolution,
force,
violence
or
other
unlawful
means.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
well,
this
won't
--
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
mr.
--
mr.
rogers
will
get
into
this
again
but
--
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
but
the
indictments
or
the
things
which
--
which
i
feel
present
the
issues
or
the
sections
of
the
law
involved
in
this
case.
and
they
all
--
those
sections
are
on
the
back.
it's
found
on
page
5a
and
6a
of
the
appellant's
brief
and
it's
section
364
(4).
this
is
the
--
and
then
7.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
and
6.
and
those
are
the
sections
we
have.
one
thing
that
should
be
pointed
out,
we
do
have
a
severability
clause
as
it
was
present
before
the
court
in
the
communist
case.
it
should
be
corrected
and
referring
to
this,
it
says,
its
376,
it's
found
on
11a
of
the
appellant's
brief
and
it
says
“deleted”
but
this
doesn't
mean
to
repeal
but
we
still
have
a
plea
to
severability
clause
as
far
as
the
act
is
concerned.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
how
many
members
of
this
organization?
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
--
could
be
found?
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
unless
--
unless
he
himself
was
charged
as
being
a
subversive
person
or
dedicated
himself
--
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
how
many
people
would
--
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
well,
i
think
in
this
particular
case
filed,
i
think
in
--
in
any
case,
it
could
be
limited
to
one.
if
he
was
strong
enough
in
his
leadership
of
that
particular
organization
to
be
able
to
control
it
to
the
extent
that
he
could
forcibly
and
effectively
advocate
and
teach
forcible
overthrow
the
government,
if
he
was
wealthy
enough
to
use
his
funds
to
--
to
have
people
print
literature
and
other
devices
so
that
these
things
would
be
used
for
the
forceful
overthrow
of
the
government
could
be
--
be
one.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's
the
conclusion,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
you
have
to
take
from
a
statute
that
the
evidence
would
show
it
to
the
degree,
the
operations
of
the
particular
organization
just
what
they
were
engaged
in
and
how
effective
they
were
and
just
put
the
control
they
had
over
the
people
that
were
considered
themselves
members.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's
--
it
would
be
a
question
of
conclusion
of
the
law
after
the
evidence
was
presented
whether
or
not
they
were
in
fact
subversive
or
communist
controlled
or
communist-front.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
yes
sir
and
this
is
--
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
well,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
well,
they're
overlapping
as
i
said
i
gave
you
my
personal
opinion
or
the
thing
where
the
statute
is
solid
as
said
by
mr.
justice
white.
it's
solid
as
to
the
definition
of
these
particular
name
type
organizations
which
are
included
on
the
definition
of
communist-front
organization.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
really
don't
know
what
--
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
he
would
--
he
would
register.
now,
the
only
--
only
crime
--
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
if
he
was
a
member
of
a
communist-front
organization,
he
knew
that
organization
to
be
engaged
in
a
forceful
overthrow
of
the
state
government
and
this
could
be
proven
and
he
had
also
proven
and
he
had
failed
to
register,
he
would
be
guilty
of
one
of
the
prohibited
acts
of
this
state
law.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
he
would
--
he
would
know
that,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
well,
he
would
know
that
the
people
he
was
dealing
with
were
actively
engaged
in
the
forceful
overthrow
of
the
state
government.
this
would
have
to
be
proven.
his
knowledge
and
willful
--
willfully
and
knowingly,
this
would
--
this
is
a
--
a
very
severe
burden
of
proof
upon
any
state
prosecutor,
it's
very
true
and
i
don't
know
what
--
mr.
john
e.
jackson,
jr.
well,
infiltrated
under
--
by
the
state
law
of
interpretation
has
a
common
meaning
unless
otherwise
announced
by
the
courts.
thank
you.
