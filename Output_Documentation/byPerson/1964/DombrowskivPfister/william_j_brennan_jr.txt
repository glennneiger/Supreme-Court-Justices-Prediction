justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
as
confused
as
mr.
justice
white.
if
--
if
the
appeal
fails
as
related
to
this
res
judicata
or
whatever
it
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
happens
to
the
indictment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
res
judicata
then
pertains
to
the
evidence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
of
course,
i
don't
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
doubt
it
but
i
don't
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
covers
simply
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
rather
dependent
was
it
or
not
on
the
success
of
your
appeal
on
the
motion
to
suppress?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it's
actually
the
appeal
fail.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
would
there
be
a
prosecution
nevertheless
of
dombrowski
under
the
indictment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
evidence
of
the
prosecution.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
position
of
that
state
of
louisiana
towards
it,
on
principle?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
take
it,
mr.
jackson
that
the
state
has
an
appeal
of
right
from
the
grants
of
a
motion
to
suppress?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not
discretionary
for
the
supreme
court
to
understand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
under
the
federal
statute,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
may
be
modeled
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
stated
that
the
--
there
are
expressed
definitions
on
the
federal
statute
of
a
communist
action
organization,
communist-front
organization
and
communist
infiltrated
organization.
as
i
read
your
statute,
you
lump
them
all
together.
they
were
all
communist-front
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
don't
tell
us
what
communist-front
is
except
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
you
think
that's
rather
a
vital
distinction
between
the
federal
statute
and
this
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
or
the
same
as.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
same
as.
they're
the
same.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
not
the
same,
the
same
edge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
it
--
it
was
the
one
that
named
--
just
another
name
for
this
organization?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
what
the
holding
was?
