chief

earl
warren
--
versus
james
h.
pfister
et
al.
mr.
hubert,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
premise
for
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kinoy.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
jackson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
does
this
include
a
motion
to
suppress
also?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
understand
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
as
i
understand
mr.
hubert
to
say
that
that
was
argued
in
the
supreme
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
absolutely.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
on
what
page?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
--
how
many
communists,
would
it
be
necessary
for
the
--
the
state
to
find
in
this
southern
conference
to
make
it
in
an
infiltrated
communist
organization.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
if
you
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
if
you
just
--
if
you
just
happen
to
find
one
in
there,
i
don't
suppose
this
would
be
an
infiltrated
organization,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
we're
talking
about
--
i'm
talking
about
the
definition
of
a
com
--
infiltrated
--
communist
infiltrated
organization.
now,
what
do
you
have
to
prove
--
to
prove
that
it
is
an
infiltrated
communist
organization?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
have
to
show
where
(voice
overlap)
for
that
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
where
does
your
--
where
does
your
definition
say
that
--
that
they
must
infiltrate
to
the
--
to
the
point
where
they
control
the
organization?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
that
must
be
inferred
from
the
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
doesn't
say
communist
controlled.
you
make
the
distinction
between
communist
infiltrated
organization
and
communist
controlled
organization
because
your
act
says
a
communist-front
organization,
a
communist
infiltrated
organization
or
communist
controlled
organization.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
difference
between
a
communist
controlled
organization
and
communist
infiltrated
corporation
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
both
of
them
go
to
the
question
of
control.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
feel
that
you're
--
you're
certain
enough
in
your
opinion
to
--
to
say
that
the
--
that
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
would
hold
that
infiltrated
communist
organization
meant
one
infiltrated
to
the
point
where
the
communist
have
control
over
the
organization?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i've
(voice
overlap)
that's
what
i
was
finding
out.
and
a
man
who
is
looking
at
this
statute
might
have
the
same
difficulty,
might
he
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
would
register
whether
he
knew
or
not
--
whether
he
was
required
under
the
act
to
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rogers.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
your
definition
of
communist
infiltrated
organization.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
we
don't
--
we
don't
judge
your
statute
by
what
the
federal
statute
says,
do
we?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
tell
me
what
a
communist-front
organization
is.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
what
organization
was
it
that
cited
or
identified
that
the
southern
conference
has
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
subcommittee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
any
objection
to
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it's
a
purport
of
it,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
find
the
case
on
the
merits
here?
what
should
the
evidence
that
you
have
against
these
people,
is
that
what
it
is?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you're
bound
by
their
offer
of
proof,
aren't
you?
because
shouldn't
they
--
didn't
they
make
an
offer
of
proof
and
wasn't
it
understood
that
that
would
be
in
lieu
of
offering
evidence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
offer
it
for
filing
and
we'll
--
we'll
consider
it,
mr.
rogers.
