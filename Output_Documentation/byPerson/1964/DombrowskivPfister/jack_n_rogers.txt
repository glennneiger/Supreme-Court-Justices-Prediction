mr.
jack
n.
rogers
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'll
try
to
answer
a
little
further,
if
i
may,
the
questions
that
the
court
asked
mr.
jackson,
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice
about
the
question
of
communist-front.
the
statute
lumps
together,
intentionally,
these
different
classifications
of
organizations
under
the
“communist-front
organization,”
for
the
very
purpose
of
eliminating
confusion
about
this
point.
there
is
a
rule
of
presumptive
evidence
in
this
particular
section
of
the
statute,
it's
on
number
3
on
page
2
(a)
of
appellant's
brief.
and
the
purpose
of
this
simply
was
to
eliminate
the
confusion
in
the
minds
of
people
who
belong
to
these
different
types
of
organizations
so
that
if
they
know
and
actually
have
knowledge
that
the
organization
has
been
so
cited
as
commented
here
under
this
presumptive
evidence
rule
which
had
been
put
in
that
they
should
go
and
register.
we
feel
like
that
this
is
an
adequate
definition
for
the
main
reason
that
it
requires
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
defendant.
if
he
doesn't
know
it's
not
a
communist-front
organization
within
the
meaning
of
this
definition,
he
can
never
be
convicted
for
failure
to
register.
now,
this
is
a
strong
burden
of
proof
on
the
state
to
prove
his
knowledge
and
we
think
this
is
an
adequate
protection
for
him.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
well,
a
communist
infiltrated
organization
has
been
discussed
at
some
length
in
the
federal
statutes
and
litigation
on
this
matter
and
--
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
no,
of
course
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
a
communist
infiltrated
organization
under
this
particular
section
of
the
statute
to
eliminate
the
question
of
this
definition
being
vital
to
a
case
has
been
lumped
under
communist-front
organization
to
which,
this
presumptive
evidence
rule
does
apply.
the
purpose
of
this
--
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
a
communist-front
organization
under
the
rule
of
presumptive
evidence
in
the
statute
is
one
which
has
been
cited
or
otherwise
identified
by
a
committee
of
congress.
there
are
several
other
things
set
forth
here,
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
subversive
activities
control
board
or
any
subcommittee
of
congress
as
a
communist-front
organization.
now,
this
is
not
a
rule
of
law,
it's
a
rule
of
evidence
and
we've
got
it
in
here
because
it
is
rebuttable
and
if
an
accused
can
prove
either
that
he
didn't
--
did
not
have
knowledge
that
his
membership
was
in
an
organization
which
had
been
so
cited
or
that
the
organization
had
not
been
so
cited
then
he
could
initiate
any
charges
which
were
pending
against
him.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
the
senate
internal
security
subcommittee
of
united
states
senate.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
yes,
your
honor.
they
were
identified
as
the
same
organization
as
the
southern
conference
for
human
welfare
which
had
been
twice
cited
by
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities
as
a
communist-front.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
the
same
as.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
yes.
well,
it
says,
substantially
the
same.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
this
is
a
question
of
the
exact
statement
in
the
finding
of
the
senate
internal
security
subcommittee.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
precisely.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
that's
exactly
what
it
was.
they
operated
the
same
business
at
the
same
address
with
the
same
telephone
number
with
the
same
executive
director
with
practically
the
same
board
of
directors
and
they
simply
changed
the
name
because
the
old
name
had
been
cited
and
had
become
--
had
become
known
throughout
the
country
as
a
communist-front.
now,
this
brings
me
to
another
point
i
want
to
make
that
this
organization
has
held
themselves
out
even
before
this
court
today
to
be
a
civil
rights
organization
when
they
in
fact
are
not.
they're
simply
a
communist-front
organization.
they've
been
well
identified
as
such
and
they're
well
known
as
such.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
the
southern
christian
leadership
conference
has
been
cited
so
far
as
we
know
by
no
congressional
committee
and
no
federal
authority.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
our
committee
found
that
there
were
substantial
influence
on
this
group
through
the
southern
conference
educational
fund
and
we
have
what
we
think
is
adequate
evidence
of
it
in
these
exhibits
that
had
been
offered
to
the
court.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
we
don't
define
it
at
this
time.we
have
made
no
effort
to
define.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
this
is
correct.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
no,
mr.
justice
and
it
doesn't
really
mean
anything
after
this
case
because
these
people
are
not
charged
with
being
part
of
that
particular
group.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
i
don't
think
so,
no
sir.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
because
it
does
not
fit
this
presumptive
evidence
rule
which
we've
set
forth
in
the
statute.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
this
is
true
in
regard
to
the
registration
portion
of
the
statute.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
i'm
sorry,
i
can't
--
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
well,
that's
the
only
thing
--
the
only
criteria
set
forth
in
the
statute.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
correct.
this
is
precisely
our
position.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
correct,
mr.
justice.
now,
we
would
add
this
in
regard
to
the
statute
that
counsel
for
the
appellants
here
have
persistently
confused
the
two
sections,
communist-front
organization
and
subversive
organization.
now,
these
are
different
things
or
in
different
sections
of
the
statute
and
when
the
counsel
suggest
to
the
court
--
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
they
are,
yes
sir.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
when
counsel
suggest
to
the
court
that
a
man
can
be
put
in
prison
for
six
years
for
belonging
to
a
communist-front
organization,
this
is
simply
not
so.
he
can
be
put
in
jail
for
six
years
if
he
fails
to
register
or
if
he
is
engaged
in
the
management
of
a
subversive
organization
which
is
a
different
thing
entirely
and
to
find
it
was
substantially
more
detail
in
the
statute.
i
would
refer
the
court
to
section
5
of
the
statute
which
appears
on
3
(a)
of
appellants'
brief.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
that
is
correct.
the
two
things
are
not
in
any
way
dependent
upon
each
other.
subversive
organization
is
described
with
substantial
detail
and
there's
no
requirement
in
the
statute
incidentally
to
register
as
a
member
of
a
subversive
organization
only
as
a
member
of
a
communist-front
organization.
now,
these
--
these
people,
the
prime
defendant
in
the
case,
mr.
dombrowski
is
charged
with
the
management
of
a
subversive
organization
and
this
is
fixed
in
detail
here
exactly
what
a
subversive
organization
is.
it
depends
upon
doing
an
act
or
aiding
and
abiding
in
acts
that
tend
towards
the
overthrow
the
government
of
the
state.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
not
necessarily,
no.
however,
an
overt
act
by
the
defendant
is
required
and
would
be
necessarily
proven
before
he
could
be
convicted.
we'd
have
to
prove
some
degree
of
management
to
something
that
he
did
as
an
overt
act.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
there
were
two
counts
against
defendant
dombrowski
and
three
counts
against
defendant
smith
and
one
count
only
on
failure
to
register
against
defendant
waltzer.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
it
may
but
in
this
case,
that's
not
so.
in
this
case,
this
organization
is
both.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
well,
i
would
think
that
most
communist-fronts,
if
their
work
has
led
to
the
degree
of
overt
act
against
the
state
would
be
a
subversive
organization.
now,
there
are
some
that
are
just
more
or
less
study
groups
that
don't
engage
in
anything
beyond
this
and
they
conceivably
could
not
be
a
subversive
organization.
but
--
excuse
me.
but
the
other
direction
--
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
it
would.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
if
it
were
a
communist-front
study
group
provable
under
the
statute
with
the
knowledge
of
the
defendant
that
it
was
such.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
it
could
--
this
is
possible,
yes.
now,
working
on
the
other
direction,
we
have
other
subversive
organizations
that
are
not
communist-fronts,
for
instance,
black
muslims,
very
active
in
louisiana
(voice
overlap).
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
i
would
suggest
that
when
you
get
into
some
of
the
delicacies
of
the
law
in
regard
to
self
defense
and
things
like
this,
we
expect
them
to
know
it
and
we
put
them
to
the
test
in
the
criminal
court
and
we
apply
the
evidence
to
the
case
and
submit
it
to
the
jury
and
let
the
jury
decide
whether
or
not
they
knew
it.
this
is
the
only
answer
i
can
give
you
to
it,
that
the
statute
is
here
and
we
must
presume
that
these
people
have
read
it.
the
statute
in
no
way
interferes
with
the
federal
statutes,
it
deals
only
with
acts
against
the
state
itself
and
it
so
specifies.
the
statute
is
not
uncertain
because
it
prohibits
only
knowing
overt
acts.
it's
fair
because
it
condemns
no
one
without
full
due
process
go
in
the
court
being
tried
in
aligning
defense
of
themselves.
now
the
statute
--
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
in
its
present
form,
since
1962,
mr.
justice.
the
statute
was
drawn
with
a
specific
purpose
of
complying
with
the
rulings
of
this
court
in
the
cases
of
nelson
and
uphaus.
in
fact,
one
of
the
judges
of
the
three-judge
district
court
commented
from
the
bench
that
when
counsel
who
drew
the
statute
did
the
job,
he
must
have
had
the
uphaus
decision
opened
before
and
i
can
tell
the
court
that
this
is
a
fact,
that
this
was
the
situation.
it
was
designed
particularly
to
comply
with
those
decisions.
the
statute
meets
the
test
set
forth
in
the
nelson
and
uphaus
cases.
i
would
like
to
read
to
the
court
a
brief
quote
from
uphaus.
this
court
said
that
a
state
could
proceed
with
prosecutions
for
sedation
against
the
state
itself.
the
state
had
full
power
to
deal
with
internal
civil
disturbances,
thus,
registration
statute's
full
warrant
to
all
proceedings
as
to
subversive
corporations,
the
subversive
instigation
of
rights
and
a
host
of
other
subjects,
directly
affecting
state
security
furnished
grips
for
the
state's
legislative
mill.
and
we
feel
like
that
the
statute
is
valid
under
that
particular
language.
now,
as
to
reasoning
behind
this,
what
reason
is
there
why
the
state
shouldn't
use
their
police
power
control
subversive
activities?
the
uphaus
decision
clearly
recognizes
the
state's
right
to
self
protection.
this
is
a
key
point
in
uphaus.
it
affirms
nelson
on
this
even.
the
nelson
case
itself
recognizes
this.
the
constitution
guarantees
to
the
state
a
republican
form
of
government
and
there
is
no
reason
why
the
state
should
not
be
carrying
this
function
out
particularly
when
the
guidelines
of
how
to
do
it
are
so
clearly
set
forth
in
nelson
and
uphaus.
if
they
were
not
and
if
there
were
no
decisions
on
this,
i
could
see
some
justification
for
the
point
of
view
that
the
state
should
not
be
into
this
business.
but
as
long
as
the
court
has
clearly
defined
the
realm
wherein
the
state
might
proceed,
i
think
the
state's
not
only
have
a
right
but
an
obligation
to
do
what
they
can
for
their
own
self
protection.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
--
the
recess
started
was
that
in
theory,
there
is
no
reason
why
the
state
should
not
be
allowed
to
enter
into
the
field
of
regulation
of
subversive
activities
particularly
when
the
guidelines
are
so
clearly
fixed
in
the
cases
of
uphaus
and
nelson.
appellants
in
the
case
want
to
overrule
both
the
doctrines,
both
nelson
and
uphaus
and
set
up
a
new
doctrine
which
would
simply
destroy
the
police
power
of
the
states
to
regulate
at
all.
why
would
they
do
this?
well,
there
are
two
full
reasons.
if
the
federal
government
under
such
a
doctrine
did
enter
into
regulation,
the
only
way
they
could
do
it
would
be
by
a
federal
police
force
and
what
would
amount
ultimately
to
a
police
state
that
none
of
us
want.
if
they
didn't
effectively
do
it,
this
case
would
simply
open
the
floodgates
to
any
amount
of
communist-front
activity.
it
would
not
be
effectively
regulated.
there
would
be
no
way
possible
than
it
could
be
effectively
regulated.
now,
as
to
the
question
of
a
case
of
baggett
versus
bullitt,
we
see
six
separate
distinguishing
factors
between
these
cases.
first,
the
federal
statute
was
not
involved,
section
2283
of
title
xxviii
in
the
bullitt
case.
secondly,
the
prime
issue
in
baggett
versus
bullitt
was
abstention
not
jurisdiction
as
it
is
here.
next,
our
statute
proscribes
only
knowing
overt
acts
and
this
was
not
the
case
at
all
in
the
washington
statute.
next,
there
is
no
required
in
our
statute
and
this
was
not
the
case
in
the
washington
statute.
next,
our
statute
was
rewritten
for
the
specific
purpose
of
complying
with
the
decisions
in
nelson
and
uphaus
and
this
was
not
the
case
in
the
washington
statute.
it
went
clear
back
behind
the
rule
of
nelson
and
our
statute
has
been
revised
to
a
much,
we
think,
more
credible
criteria
of
guilt.
and
finally,
in
the
baggett
case,
there
was
no
pending
criminal
prosecution,
this
relates
back
up
to
2283.
this
wasn't
involved
in
the
case
at
all.
now
we
think
the
case
is
clearly
distinguishable
on
these
six
grounds.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
not
if
the
proceeding
is
already
pending,
mr.
justice
and
that's
the
situation
in
this
particular
case.
i
might
comment
on
that
but
the
2283
was
discussed
in
most
recent
case
on
the
point,
clothing
workers
versus
richman
brothers
and
this
is
about
10
years
ago.
the
court
said
this,
“the
prohibition
of
2283
is
but
continuing
evidence
of
confidence
in
the
state
courts,
reinforced
by
a
desire
to
avoid
direct
conflicts
between
state
and
federal
courts.”
and
we
think
that
this
is
a
clear
criterion
of
how
and
when
the
statute
should
be
applied
and
it
should
apply
on
this
particular
case
under
that
ruling.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
well,
if
the
effect
of
the
declaratory
judgment
is
the
same
as
an
injunction,
it
would
make
no
difference
whatsoever
one
way
or
the
other.
the
prohibition
of
the
statute
should
still
apply
and
in
this
case,
that
would
be
the
effect
of
a
declaratory
judgment.
the
same
as
if
an
injunction
were
issued.
we
see
no
reason
why
these
people
can't
offer
their
constitutional
defenses
in
the
state
criminal
court.
and
in
the
past,
this
has
been
done
and
it
has
been
successfully
done
under
the
nelson
rule
by
a
defendant
in
the
case
of
state
versus
jenkins
in
our
louisiana
supreme
court
when
the
prior
statute
that
we
have
before
this
one
was
thrown
out
on
that
basis.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
correct.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
that's
correct.
i
see
no
reason
why
it
should
not
be
done
in
this
case.
in
fact,
everything
points
to
the
--
to
the
application
of
the
rule
here.
i
mentioned
to
the
court
that
we
felt
that
this
organization
was
in
fact
not
a
civil
rights
group
but
instead,
a
communist-front
group.
i
like
to
further
suggest
to
the
court
that
all
subversive
activities,
all
of
them
in
the
southern
united
states
depend
upon
one
side
or
the
other
side
of
the
racial
issue
as
their
cover
story,
all
of
them
from
all
ranges.
you
have
the
kkk,
the
muslims,
the
nazi
party
and
then
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin
you
have
the
communist
party
itself.
this
organization,
the
student
nonviolent
coordinating
committee
and
some
200
other
communist-front
organizations
that
beauregard
told
us
two
years
ago
that
this
organization
had
under
surveillance.
he
testified
to
this
in
the
congressional
hearing
on
appropriations.
now,
we
have
offered
in
annexes
to
our
brief
to
the
court
what
we
think
is
adequate
proof
of
this
organization's
affiliation
with
the
communist
party
and
i
would
like
with
the
permission
of
the
chief
justice
to
offer
it
further
annex
--
annex
e,
a
recent
report
of
our
committee
dated
january
19,
1965
for
the
same
purpose,
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
the
purport
is
a
continuation
and
extension
of
the
other
two
annexes
which
we
have
already
filed.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
no
sir,
your
honor.
it
is
not
at
all
that.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
these
people
have
raised
the
issue
before
this
court
in
their
pleadings
and
in
their
offers
of
proof
that
they
are
a
civil
rights
organization.
now,
this
is
factually
and
simply
not
so.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
this
is
correct,
but
in
addition
to
that,
they
have
also
offered
affidavits
which
we
think
are
totally
extraneous
to
the
record
dealing
with
their
status
and
we
think
that
these
things
are
justified
on
that
basis.
mr.
jack
n.
rogers
thank
you
mr.
justice.
now,
i
have
one
or
two
other
points
i
want
to
make
before
concluding,
if
i
may.
counsel
alleges
that
this
statute
is
set
up
to
bring
about
both
restrictions.
well,
i
would
only
suggest
an
answer
to
this
that
large
numbers
of
new
voters
are
in
fact
registering
now
to
vote
in
louisiana.
they're
in
no
way
hampered
by
the
statute.
it
deals
only
with
subversion
and
it
is
only
been
applied
to
such.
we
believe
that
any
legitimate
civil
rights
group
can
work
in
louisiana
without
violating
the
statute
on
subversive
activities.
there's
no
reason
why
they
can't
do
it
because
this
thing
deals
with
overt
acts
in
a
highly
specific
manner.
now,
i
have
one
item
to
answer
to
mr.
hubert's
argument,
if
i
may.
he
suggested
that
i
was
a
defendant
in
this
case.
i
am
not
and
have
never
been.
one
other
point
i
want
to
make
an
answer
to
mr.
kinoy's
argument.
he
suggests
that
there
was
an
unconstitutional
application
of
the
statute
in
this
case
and
i
could
only
answer
that
by
a
question.
how
could
the
state
better
get
due
process
to
these
defendants
than
by
preparing
the
evidence
which
they
had
in
the
form
of
affidavits
and
taking
it
to
a
criminal
court
judge,
offering
it
to
him
and
saying,
judge,
here
is
our
case
against
these
people.
we
think
search
warrants
are
the
issue.
will
you
consider
this
and
give
us
your
ruling
as
to
whether
there
exists
adequate
cause
in
this
case
and
if
so,
sign
these
search
warrants
for
us.
now,
this
is
exactly
what
was
done.
and
by
signing
the
search
warrants,
the
judge
ruled
that
there
was
adequate
cause.
he
had
to,
to
sign
to
justify
the
signing
of
those
search
warrants.
now,
we
have
given
these
people
due
process
all
the
way
through
this
case.
there
has
been
no
unconstitutional
application
of
this
statute
in
any
way,
shape
or
form.
in
conclusion,
the
sole
issue
as
we
see
it
legally
before
this
court
is
a
question
of
whether
the
lower
court
had
jurisdiction
particularly
under
the
statute,
section
2283.
there's
no
decision
or
record
from
the
court
below
to
justify
the
court
at
this
time
going
any
further
into
the
case
itself.
i'm
sure
the
court
is
aware
that
there
has
been
some
criticism
on
this
point
against
the
court
from
outside
sources
on
taking
cases
piecemeal
and
this
is
what
this
would
amount
to.
eventually,
by
the
process
of
criminal
justice,
this
case
will
probably
reach
the
court.
and
if
the
court
decides
one
issue
today
and
the
trial
of
these
people
continues
and
they
are
convicted,
it
will
be
back
here
again
eventually.
secondly,
title
xxviii,
section
2283
is
highly
specific.
it
clearly
and
particularly
prohibits
exactly
what
the
appellants
want
the
court
to
do
in
this
case.
can
and
should
a
federal
court
enjoin
a
pending
state
criminal
procedure?
well,
the
congress
says
--
it
simply
said
no.
that's
all
it
is
to
it.
they've
said
no.
ours
is
a
government
basically
of
divided
powers.our
overriding
goal
should
be
a
principle
constitutionalism
of
the
doctrines
of
federalism
and
separation
of
powers
are
fundamental
in
the
constitution
itself.
they're
even
recognized
in
the
bill
of
rights
in
article
x.
the
constitution
in
the
bill
of
rights
and
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
any
construction
of
this
which
violates
the
basic
principles
of
constitutionalism
should
be
very
strictly
applied
by
the
courts
and
it
should
be
very
seriously
considered
because
however
great
the
appeal
this
might
be
in
a
single
case,
the
overall
principles
of
the
constitution
must
stand
fast
and
basically
in
the
--
inherent
in
them
are
the
two
things
of
federalism
and
separation
of
powers.
i
would
answer
further
by
saying
simply
that
the
prime
responsibility
of
any
government,
over
and
above
and
overriding
that
to
even
its
individual
citizens
is
maintenance
of
the
government
within
the
constitutional
framework.
this
is
fundamental,
the
basic,
single
responsibility
of
any
government
to
maintain
itself
within
the
constitutional
framework
and
we
urge
that
if
these
two
sections
of
the
constitution
are
in
fact
in
conflict
in
this
case
that
the
overriding
of
basic
principle
constitutionalism
should
prevail
and
we
ask
that
the
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court.
