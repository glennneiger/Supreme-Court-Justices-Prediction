chief

we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
udall,
secretary
of
the
interior,
petitioner
versus
james
k.
tallman
et
al.
and
before
we
proceed
with
that
case,
the
orders
of
the
court
have
been
certified
by
the
chief
justice
and
filed
with
the
clerk
and
will
not
be
announced
orally.
and
you
completed
your
opening
argument
mr.
barnett?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.
wheatley?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
know
how
many
other
leases
there
were
granted
in
amount
or
that
these
leases
that
were
granted,
mr.
wheatley?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
in
many
or
field
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
asking
just
for
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
would
that
represent
whether
you
have
a
--
that
he
did
this
in
a
uniform
way
or
took
him
in
the
order
in
which
they
were
filed
or
was
there
anything
unusual
from
that
standpoint?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
wheatley,
on
that
part
you
say
that
this
is
merely
a
controversy
between
you
and
the
other
--
and
the
lessees
in
this
case
and
that
other
leases
are
not
relevant
because
they're
not
in
this
case
but
neither
or
--
neither
did
you
bring
the
lessees
in
this
case,
into
it.
they
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
come
in
and
present
this
argument,
did
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
on
the
hearing,
that's
after
it's
over.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
on
the
question
on
whether
they
were
charged
(voice
overlap)
and
what
was
going
on
administratively,
might
not
your
clients
be
charged
with
notice
also
when
you
knew
what
the
secretary
of
the
interior
was
doing
during
this
period?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
there
are
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
go
right
ahead
in
your
own
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if,
as
you
believe,
they'd
be
foreclosed
by
our
judgment
here,
it
wouldn't
do
much
good,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
barnett.
