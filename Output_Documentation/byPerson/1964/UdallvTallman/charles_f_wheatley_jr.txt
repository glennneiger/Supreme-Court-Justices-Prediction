mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
1941
executive
order
which
created
the
kenai
moose
reserve
with
drawing
certain
lands
therein
from
settlement,
location,
sale
or
entry
or
other
disposition
except
for
fish
traps
sites
under
any
of
the
public
land
laws
applicable
to
alaska
means
something
less
than
any.
so,
it
must
be
construed
as
a
withdrawal
under
any
of
the
public
land
laws
applicable
to
alaska
except
the
mineral
leasing
act.
now,
the
public
lands
belong
to
the
people
of
the
country
and
secretary
of
interior
as
guardian
of
those
lands
must
act
in
a
reasonable
way
with
respect
to
them.
the
purpose
of
publishing
orders
declaring
the
status
of
the
land
is
to
advice
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
as
to
the
status
of
those
lands
if
the
effect
of
the
1941
order
was
to
pose
a
“keep
out”
notice
on
this
kenai
moose
range
then
certainly
was
unfair
and
unlawful
for
others
to
enter
into
that
range
prior
to
the
time
that
the
lands
were
validly
open
thereto.
conversely,
when
the
secretary
publishes
an
order
or
an
order
is
published
regarding
the
status
of
lands,
it
has
the
effect
of
limiting
the
secretary's
discretion
with
respect
to
those
lands.
he's
bound
by
the
words
that
are
contained
in
the
order.
he
cannot
in
subsequently
construing
the
order
say
that
the
words
of
the
order
which
say
“white”
mean
black
for
that
when
the
order
says,
“closed”
it
meant
open.
yet,
this
is
precisely.
we
submit
what
the
secretary
would
urge
this
court
to
do
here.
such
an
unlimited
par,
we
suggest
is
inconsistent
with
the
secretary's
trust
as
guardian
of
the
public
lands.
now,
the
three
judges
below
who
certainly
had
no
reason
not
to
consider
the
terms
of
this
executive
order
any
differently
than
any
other
reasonable
man
would
do
unanimously
found
that
they
had
the
effect
of
closing
the
range
to
oil
and
gas
leasing.
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
the
plain
language
of
the
1941
executive
order.
it's
difficult
to
imagine
any
more
exhausted
language
in
that
use.
the
lands
were
to
be
withdrawn
from
settlement,
location,
sale
or
entry
or
other
disposition
except
for
fish
traps
sites
under
any
of
the
public
land
laws
applicable
in
alaska.
now,
the
word
“disposition”
used
in
the
order
which
have
been
used
by
congress
in
the
mineral
leasing
act
to
describe
leasing
under
the
act;
section
1
of
the
mineral
leasing
act
states
that
deposits
of
oil,
oil
shale,
or
gas
and
lands
containing
such
deposits
shall
be
subject
to
disposition
in
the
form
and
matter
provided
in
this
act
and
section
17
of
the
mineral
leasing
act
which
is
a
section
of
the
act
which
governs
the
leases
in
this
case
specifically
provides
all
lands
subject
to
disposition
under
this
act
which
are
known
or
believe
to
contain
oil
and
gas
deposits
may
be
leased
by
the
secretary.
in
1926,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
cert
denied
said
that
the
mineral
leasing
act
was
the
expression
of
a
new
policy
for
the
disposition
of
public
lands
open
to
exploration
or
entry
by
lease
instead
of
by
complete
alienation.
and
this
court
in
1928
in
kenai
coastal
oil
company
versus
kieffer
in
277
u.s.
likewise
described
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1920
as
affecting
the
disposal
of
oil
and
gas
deposits
on
the
public
lands.
secondly,
we
submit,
it's
clear
that
the
mineral
leasing
act
is
a
public
land
law
applicable
to
alaska.
we
think
it's
virtually
incontestable
that
the
regulations
of
the
department
in
effect
in
1941
expressly
so
provide.
part
51
of
those
regulations
referred
to
the
public
land
laws
which
were
generally
applicable
in
alaska
and
provide
that
those
laws
would
be
applicable
--
public
land
laws
generally
applicable
in
the
united
states,
that
those
public
land
laws
would
be
applicable
to
alaska.
part
71
of
the
regulations
expressly
deals
with
the
mineral
leasing
laws
and
the
regulation
states
here
that
disposition
of
oil
and
gas
deposits
in
lands
owned
by
united
states
in
alaska
is
governed
by
the
act
of
february
25,
1920
known
as
the
mineral
leasing
act.
furthermore,
the
mineral
leasing
act
itself
is
clear
that
it
was
intended
to
apply
the
alaska
section
22
as
originally
enacted
1920.
the
alaska
oil
proviso
makes
it
clear
that
the
terms
of
the
act
were
to
be
generally
applicable
to
lands
in
that
state
or
in
that
territory.
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
the
fish
trap
exception,
the
government
as
well
as
the
amici
reach
view
on
standard
agree
that
this
language
had
no
--
they
argued
that
this
language
had
no
place
in
the
order
and
it
shouldn't
be
there
at
all.
well,
this
is
certainly
true
on
their
construction
because
it's
simply
a
reconcilable
with
this
construction
but
we
assert
that
the
fish
traps
site
exception
just
can't
be
wished
to
wait.
fish
trap
sites
were
very
important
to
the
economy
of
alaska
at
this
time
and
the
fish
trap
site
exception
to
the
words
“disposition”
is
consistent
only
with
construing
this
order
as
close
to
leasing.
this
is
because
the
fish
trap
sites
are
not
alienations
of
title
but
involved
the
use
of
an
area.
now,
in
the
argument
on
thursday,
counsel
for
the
government
referred
to
another
refuge,
the
kodiak
national
wildlife
refuge
which
was
created
in
1941
in
alaska
which
had
language
somewhat
similar
to
the
language
of
this
executive
order
and
noted
there
however
that
it
did
not
contain
the
fish
trap
exception.
well,
the
reason
for
this
is
clear
that
kodiak
wildlife
refuge
in
executive
order
8857
expressly
accepted
a
strip
of
land
one
mile
in
width
along
the
entire
shoreline
of
that
refuge.
quite
contrary,
if
the
kenai
refuge
which
was
created
in
1941
the
same
year
accepted
area
here
did
not
embrace
the
entire
shoreline
and
had
this
long
area
of
shoreline
here
which
was
not
within
accepted
area
and
which
i'm
advised
they
were
fish
traps
of
that
time
but
this
goes
to
show
we
submit
that
the
‘41
executive
order
was
very
carefully
drawn.
we
say
this
is
shown
further
by
the
words
of
the
order
referring
to
the
special
statutes
applicable
to
alaska
for
fur
farming
and
grazing.
we
have
in
our
brief
shown
where
all
of
the
special
statutes,
we
studied
all
of
them.
we
find
that
these
were
the
only
two
which
by
their
terms
would
apply
unless
they
were
specifically
accepted.
all
of
the
other
--
or
the
lesser
special
alaska
statutes
by
their
terms
or
by
their
regulations
controlling
them
would
not
be
applicable
to
our
reserved
area.
it
certainly,
the
intent
of
excluding
fur
farming
and
grazing
of
closing
the
area
of
that
that
these
functions
are
certainly
no
less
the
inconsistent,
we
submit,
the
use
of
the
range
for
moose
then
is
the
commercial
activity
that
would
normally
be
attended
in
oil
and
gas
leasing.
we
submit
that
this
shows
that
the
intent
was
to
cover
the
water
front,
to
cover
every
conceivable
type
of
user
disposition
of
this
range
in
the
non-accepted
area
and
close
it
to
entry.
now,
the
words
used
to
the
1941
order,
withdraw
from
settlement
location
sale
or
entry.
these
words
are
also
identical
to
the
words
that
we
used
in
the
1948
order
which
affected
the
accepted
area.
these
words
have
been
judicially
construed.
they're
taken
--
they're
identical
to
the
language
contained
in
the
1910
pickett
act
by
congress.
now,
that
pickett
act
was
passed
in
1910
to
ratify
the
withdrawal
by
present
intent
in
1909
of
certain
public
lands
for
oil
and
gas
purposes.
the
question
came
up
after
the
mineral
leasing
act
was
enacted
in
1920
when
oil
and
gas
lands
were
treated
by
leasing
as
to
whether
or
not
the
pickett
act
language
would
apply
to
withdraw
from
leasing
under
the
mineral
leasing
act.
president
hoover
during
the
depression
had
withdrawn
some
substantial
acreage
from
oil
and
gas
leasing
under
the
mineral
leasing
act.
his
withdrawal
was
challenged
on
the
very
same
grounds
that
the
government
challenges
this
withdrawal
on
the
ground
that
the
pickett
act
language
which
had
been
used
would
not
suffice
to
withdraw
the
area
--
the
oil
and
gas
lease
from
mineral
leasing.
the
question
was
squarely
presented
in
the
landmark
decision
of
wilbur
versus
united
states,
ex
rel
barton
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
decision
held
that
the
act
of
1910,
the
pickett
act
was
apparent,
we
think,
this
court
stated
that
the
act
of
1910
was
intended
to
be
a
wide
scope
and
recognized
the
presence
--
the
authority
of
the
present
temporarily
to
prevent
the
alienation
of
public
lands
or
any
interest
therein
adverse
to
united
states.
under
the
act
of
1920,
the
applicant
for
a
permit
was
required
to
locate
and
designate
the
lands
sought
in
his
application.
the
issuance
of
a
permit
and
the
discovery
of
valuable
deposits
of
oil
and
gas
entitle
in
to
a
lease
and
interest
in
the
land.
this,
we
think,
was
akin
to
location
or
entry
as
used
in
the
act
of
1910.
converse
to
what
the
government
states,
this
court
did
affirmed
this
basis
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
united
states
ex
rel.
mclennan
versus
wilbur
at
page
419.
now,
the
government
admits
in
its
reply
brief
that
the
words
of
the
pickett
act
which
were
used
in
this
order
do
authorize
the
president
to
withdraw
lands
from
oil
and
gas
leasing
under
the
mineral
leasing
act.
this
being
so,
we
submit
that
when
president
roosevelt
used
those
words
in
1941,
he
must
have
given
them
the
judicially
construed
meaning
as
powerful
expensive
enough
to
close
the
lands
to
oil
and
gas
leasing
under
the
mineral
leasing
act.
we
say
this
is
further
supported
by
the
administrative
practice
in
effect
at
the
time
this
order
--
these
orders
were
issued.
it
controlling
the
administrative
practice
we
submit
which
is
no
where
are
mentioned
by
the
amici
or
the
government
in
its
brief
is
that
when
the
pickett
act
is
used,
that
language
is
used
in
a
withdrawal
order
and
mineral
leasing
is
intended,
the
withdrawal
expressly
so
provides.
now,
from
the
time
of
the
1930's
to
the
time
of
these
orders
when
leasing
was
intended,
a
number
of
the
executive
orders
were
issued
which
expressly
did
state
that
it
was
permitted
for
instances
in
1936
when
president
roosevelt
created
the
charles
sheldon
antelope
range,
the
language
is
expressly
provided.
the
lands
are
here
--
hereby
withdrawn
from
settlement,
location,
sale
or
entry
and
reserve
and
set
apart
provided
that
nothing
herein
shall
restrict
prospecting,
locating,
developing,
mining,
entering,
leasing
or
patenting
the
mineral
resources
of
the
lands
under
the
applicable
laws.
there
are
number
of
other
executive
orders
similar
to
this
in
1939
and
in
appendix
d
of
our
brief,
table
2,
we
list
some
125
such
orders
from
the
period
of
time
in
1937
to
1955
where
leasing
was
expressly
authorized
in
the
term
of
the
withdrawal.
now,
the
government
asserts
that
this
is
all
set
by
a
table
3
in
the
marathon
and
union
amici
brief
but
we
say
this
is
not
so.
none
of
the
orders
contained
in
table
3
of
the
marathon
brief
used
the
pickett
act
language.
instead
they
used
a
different
language
that
the
lands
were
withdrawn
from
appropriation
including
were
excluding
the
mineral
leasing
as
our
tables
shows.
the
government
admits
that
this
practice
using
the
different
language
in
the
withdrawal
order
became
regular
around
1944
but
when
pickett
act
language
was
used
and
mineral
leasing
was
intended,
we
submit
the
order
expressly
so
provided.
an
example
of
this
which
is
not
contained
in
our
brief
was
executive
order
6957
of
1935.
that
was
withdrawal
by
president
roosevelt
in
1935
of
certain
lands
in
alaska
from
settlement,
location,
sale,
entry
or
other
form
of
appropriation
and
reserved
for
classification.
now,
in
1943
which
was
during
the
time
that
this
different
form
of
language
was
involved,
the
government's
secretary
felt
necessary
to
amend
and
specifically
modify
this
earlier
order
in
order
to
permit
leasing.
public
land
order
149
of
july
17,
1943,
eighth
federal
register
10371
specifically
modified
the
earlier
1935
executive
orders
so
as
to
permit
leasing
under
the
coal
leasing
act
of
1914.
other
examples
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
33
in
the
case
of
mary
e.
brown.
well,
in
summary
therefore,
we
submit
that
the
plain
meaning
of
the
language
is
judicial
construction
and
the
administrative
practice
regarding
the
language
used
in
these
orders
was
clear
that
the
intent
was
to
withdraw
these
lands
from
oil
and
gas
leasing.
now,
in
rebuttal,
the
petitioners
seeks
to
rely
on
facts
regarding
other
leases
in
this
range
which
are
not
in
the
record
and
apparently
seeks
to
rely
on
these
facts
of
these
other
leases
for
two
purposes.
first,
as
what
he
might
call
an
in
terrorem,
an
argument
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
reverse
not
because
it's
wrong
but
because
other
leases
may
have
been
erroneously
issued
in
the
range
and
secondly,
what
we
call
a
bootstrap
argument
that
the
range
was
open
all
along.
we're
taking
the
in
terrorem
argument
first.
we
suggest
the
secretary
does
not
seriously
believe
that
this
is
a
problem.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
was
limited
to
the
determination
of
which
of
two
conflicting
groups
had
the
valid
right
to
tend
leases
and
which
of
these
conflicting
applications
prevails.
no
one
else
had
standing,
we
suggest,
with
respect
to
any
of
their
leases
to
challenge
that.
and
if
anyone
else
said,
did
have
a
lease
offer
pending
prior
to
the
issuance
of
any
of
these
other
leases,
the
statutory
period
set
by
congress
for
bringing
action
to
contest
those
other
leases
has
long
since
past.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
i
don't
your
honor.
the
government
has
alleged
in
--
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
there
are
many.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
i
think
the
government
has
alleged
your
honor
that
there
are
many
and
i
believe
that
is
true.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
alright,
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
there
was
that
--
we
submit
that
until
1958
when
the
secretary
published
an
express
order
declaring
these
--
this
area
of
the
range
open
to
oil
and
gas
leasing.
until
that
time,
the
area
was
closed
until
actual
leases
that
were
issued
adverse
to
the
respondents
in
this
case
were
not
issued
until
after
that
order
had
been
published
declaring
that
there
--
it
would
be
leasing
in
this
area.
and
the
circumstances
surrounding
that
order
show,
we
submit,
that
it
was
erroneous
to
issue
leases
to
anyone
who
had
filed
offers
in
this
area
while
it
was
closed
and
it's
conceded
by
all
sides
that
if
the
area
was
closed
by
the
terms
of
the
executive
order
prior
to
1958
that
the
respondents
are
the
first
qualified
applicants
for
these
leases
and
that
is
our
position
in
case.
well,
after
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
this
case,
it
is
true
that
news
got
out
that
union
and
marathon
were
working
around
the
clock
to
file
a
new
top
filings
on
their
leases
based
on
the
1958
offers.
as
in
the
earlier
and
since
in
1954
when
richfield
first
went
in
to
the
kenai
range,
this
caused
a
rush
in
a
number
of
people
including
some
of
the
people
in
our
group
were
prompted
to
do
likewise
but
this
is
not
an
uncommon
thing
and
since
no
one
has
standing
to
challenge
these
other
leases,
the
secretary's
hands
were
not
tied.
he's
free
do
whatever
he
likes
with
respect
to
these
other
leases.
regardless
of
the
decision
or
the
outcome
of
this
case,
today
he's
done
nothing
with
respect
to
this
and
we
submit
that
the
entire
matter
regarding
these
other
leases
is
speculative
and
premature
at
the
present
time.
i'd
like
to
turn
next
to
the
contention
by
the
government
that
evidence
of
the
department's
action
with
respect
to
other
leases
is
somehow
relevant
to
show
that
they
--
their
status.
we
say
this
argument
is
improper
for
three
reasons.
first,
the
facts
regarding
all
of
these
other
leases
other
than
the
ones
in
controversy
in
this
case
are
in
dispute
as
to
what
the
facts
exactly
were
and
we
submit
they
can't
be
tried
here
by
ex
parte
and
affidavit.
for
instance,
the
government
in
its
petition
for
certiorari
and
its
brief
originally
asserted
that
there
were
number
of
leases
issued
in
the
closed
area
prior
1955
and
21
such
leases
and
that
these
were
before
congress
in
1956.
now,
we
had
three
people
checked
to
the
land
office
records
per
week
regarding
the
status
of
these
leases
and
we
found
that
that
was
an
error
and
we
so
state
in
our
brief.
the
government
in
its
reply
came
back
and
submitted
a
letter
from
the
anchorage
land
office
manager
which
admitted
that
it
was
wrong
with
respect
to
these
other
leases.
it's
--
the
letter
states
that
other
than
the
swanson
river
leases,
it's
through
here
which
were
issued
in
1956,
there
were
no
other
leases
issued
in
the
range
prior
to
1958
after
the
time
that
the
lands
were
opened
that
these
other
leases
so
alleged
were
erroneous.
similarly,
the
full
facts
regarding
the
swanson
river
unit
had
never
been
developed
in
this
record.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
your
honor,
i
suggest
that
the
other
lessees
in
this
case
where
fully
advised
of
all
of
the
administrative
proceedings
before
the
department.
in
fact,
they
received
by
certified
mail,
a
copy
of
our
petition
for
rehearing
before
the
department
which
raised
the
exact
same
grounds,
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case
on
subsequently.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
this
was
in
the
--
this
was
no,
this
was
before
the
department,
before
the
case
went
to
court.
they
had
notice
of
the
denial
of
that
final
petition
for
rehearing.
under
the
law
at
that
time,
there
was
just
one
court
in
the
country
in
which
this
case
could've
been
brought
and
that
was
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
the
action
had
to
be
broad
by
statute
within
a
90-day-period,
it
was.
we
submit
that
the
oil
companies
certainly
if
they
were
interested
in
the
effect
of
this
case
as
they
now
they
are
where
certainly
had
enough
of
interest
to
determine
whether
the
case
had
been
filed
within
that
period
of
time.
we
suggest
that
they
stayed
out
of
the
case
for
tactical
reasons
and
did
not
join
in
the
proceeding.
now,
this
is
not
an
uncommon
thing.
these
suits
for
judicial
review
of
the
secretary
of
interior's
action
in
issuing
oil
and
gas
leases
are
similar
to
other
actions
to
judicial
review
of
other
administrative
agencies.
the
respondent
or
the
defendant
that
needs
action
is
always
the
agency.
the
other
parties
to
whom
a
license
or
a
lease
or
some
other
action
is
granted
has
a
right
to
intervene
but
if
it
is
required
that
they
be
joined,
it
would
defeat
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
in
almost
every
instance
because
you
would
not
be
able
to
obtain
jurisdiction
over
all
the
parties
in
the
court.
now,
in
the
court
of
appeals
has
expressly
held
in
the
case
of
barish
versus
seaton
that
the
lessees,
the
adverse
lessees
are
not
indispensable
parties.
the
government
has
waived
this
argument
of
indispensable
party
in
this
case.
and
we
submit
that
it
properly
has
done
so
because
it
is
not
and
could
not
be
an
issue
at
this
time.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
yes.
i
agree
with
you
sir.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
well,
your
honor
i
plan
to
discuss
in
chronological
fashion
each
of
the
incidents
--
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
--
to
regard
in
this
range
--
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
--
where
it
involves
a
sweeping
analysis
of
everything
that
happened.
i
planned
to
do
that
--
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
no,
i
--
i
don't
want
to
not
answer
your
question
but
i'm
coming
to
it
almost
immediately
here.
the
--
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
no.
the
standard
procedure
the
way
a
number
of
other
cases
have
been
handled
mr.
clark
is
that
a
judgment
is
entered
on
remand
in
the
district
court
declaring
that
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
entitled
to
the
leases.
and
the
secretary
cancels
the
outstanding
leases
and
merely
issues
them
to
us.
now,
this
court
last
year
held
that
that
the
secretary
has
this
power
under
the
mineral
leasing
act
to
administratively
cancel
leases
to
correct
the
errors
that
have
been
made
and
that
is
all
that
would
be
involved
here
and
this
has
happened
in
many
other
cases
in
the
past.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
would
presume
that
they
would
feel
that
the
judgment
of
this
court,
the
reason
of
this
court
would
be
the
final
conclusion
on
the
issues
of
all
involved
in
the
case.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
i
think
it
would
and
the
question
was
decided,
we
think,
in
somewhat
analogist
fashion
in
the
case
of
just
by
order
beezer
versus
the
city
of
seattle
this
year
where
it
held
that
a
party
who
did
not
participate
in
federal
proceedings
in
the
federal
review
proceedings
thereafter
could
not
subsequently
come
back
and
challenge
the
decision
that
was
there
made.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
beezer
was
never
been
a
party
in
the
--
in
those
proceedings
and
this
court
--
in
the
court
of
supreme
court
of
washington
held
that
he
was
not
a
party
and
for
that
reason
he
was
not
bound
by
the
federal
proceedings
but
this
court
in
the
per
curiam
order
reversed
the
supreme
court
of
washington
and
this
was
one
of
the
points
which
was
i
going
to
in
length
in
the
reason
of
that
case.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
we
suggest
that
they
of
course
were
parties
in
the
proceeding
before
the
department.
they
had
a
perfect
right
to
intervene
in
this
proceeding
for
judicial
review
of
the
secretary's
decision
in
the
courts.
and
we
suggest
that
they
should've
intervened
at
that
time.
now,
it
may
be
that
they
will
seek
further
litigation
in
this
case.
we
don't
know.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
well,
we
say
that
they
had
the
opportunity
to
appear.
i
admit
mr.
chief
justice
that
this
is
a
question
of
law
that
has
not
been
decided
is
to
what
the
effect
of
these
proceedings
would
be
on
their
rights.
we
do
say
that
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
have
reviewed
the
secretary
where
the
adverse
lessee
has
not
been
a
party
of
the
proceeding.
last
year
in
boesche
versus
udall
that
was
a
situation
here.
the
adverse
applicant
was
not
before
this
court.
this
court
had
no
difficulty
in
deciding
the
facts
and
the
issues
involved
in
that
case
and
that
has
happened
in
a
number
of
other
cases.
we
submit
that
it
is
also
the
practice
with
respect
to
most
all
of
the
administrative
agencies
that
it's
not
required
that
the
adverse
license
order
of
who
ever
gets
the
rights
from
agency
be
joined,
he
has
a
right
to
intervene
and
if
he
likes
to
do
that
why
he
can.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
yes,
he
does,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
wheatley,
jr.
they
have
a
right
to
participate
in
that
hearing
and
it
takes
any
judicial
review
from
it
at
that
time.
our
second
argument
regarding
the
impropriety
we
suggest
for
getting
into
all
of
these
other
facts
regarding
this
other
leases
is
that
the
government
has
waived
its
opportunity
to
do
so.
this
case
was
presented
in
the
district
court
upon
a
record
which
did
not
contain
any
of
this
other
detail
which
we
now
see
on
this
map
regarding
the
swanson
river
unit
or
any
of
these
other
leases
other
than
the
leases
that
were
involved
in
this
controversy.
and
the
government
in
support
of
its
motion
for
summary
judgment
stated
that
there
was
no
genuine
issue
of
fact
involved
in
this
case
and
that
was
the
case
that
was
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals.
that
is
the
case
that
is
before
your
honors
on
this
record.
it
does
not
contain
all
of
these
other
evidence.
finally,
it
was
only
after
their
petition
for
rehearing
was
denied
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
government
suggested
anything
to
the
court
below
that
any
thing
that
they
had
done
regarding
these
other
leases
was
anyhow
relevant
to
the
case.
but
even
assuming
that
all
of
these
data
which
has
been
presented
here
by
affidavit
is
accurate
and
is
complete
and
it
was
finally
developed
that
the
appropriate
time
in
the
proceedings
with
an
opportunity
for
us
to
provide
rebuttal,
we
submit
it
doesn't
affect
the
merits
of
the
decision
below.
all
of
this
material
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
final
petition
for
reconsideration
that
are
now
for
rehearing
and
it
rejected.
i'd
now
like
to
go
through
what
happened
in
this
range
in
chronological
step
by
step
fashion
and
discuss
the
other
leases
when
i
reach
them.
well,
in
1941
when
the
range
was
created,
it's
clear
at
that
time
that
there
were
other
refuges
in
the
country
which
were
closed
to
leasing.
we
found
some
14
or
15
which
have
language
similar
to
that
of
the
kenai
order
and
on
anybody's
terms
there's
a
refuge
in
1943
which
was
created
after
the
government
adopted
this
different
procedure
in
the
salt
plaints
in
oklahoma
that
was
closed.
further,
in
the
hearings
before
the
house
committee
in
1956,
the
acting
assistant
solicitor
for
the
department
of
the
interior
expressly
affirmed
there
that
some
of
the
wildlife
refuges
in
the
united
states
were
close
by
the
terms
of
the
orders
creating
them.
now,
on
1947,
we
have
the
1947
regulations.
the
government
admitted
here
an
argument
last
thursday
and
we
think
it's
quite
true
that
these
regulations
are
general.
they
don't
apply
to
any
refuges
which
were
otherwise
closed
by
the
terms
of
the
orders
creating
them.
now,
in
1948,
we
have
public
land
order
487,
that
withdrew
this
portion
of
the
accepted
area
of
the
range.
we
submit
that
in
construing
public
land
order
487,
it
has
to
be
construed
in
relationship
to
the
1941
order.
the
1941
order
did
not
leave
this
completely
opened.
it
was
still
part
of
the
range.
it's
just
said
it
was
opened
to
use
disposition.
when
the
1948
public
land
order
came
along,
the
effect
of
that
was
to
simply
close
this
portion
of
accepted
area
two
years
in
this
position.
in
1953,
there
was
the
issuance
of
the
general
suspension
order
by
the
department
that
this
was
a
general
order,
it
didn't
pertains
specifically
to
the
kenai
range,
it
pertain
to
all
wildlife
areas
and
refuges
throughout
the
country.
and
further,
it
only
applied
to
those
refuges
which
by
their
terms
were
opened
to
oil
and
gas
leasing.
the
deputy
solicitor
in
the
case
below
expressly
said
that
‘53
suspension
order
was
applicable
only
to
areas
otherwise
available
for
leasing,
as
in
‘41.
so,
at
this
time
in
1953
when
the
general
suspension
order
was
in
effect,
it
could've
applied
only
to
this
blue
area
of
the
accepted
area
which
was
never
withdrawn
at
any
time.
now,
in
1954,
the
lease
offers
were
filed
after
richfield
went
into
the
area.
we
think
it's
curious
as
mr.
justice
white
noted
that
no
lease
offers
were
filed
in
this
range
prior
to
thereto
since
it
was
created
in
1941
where
the
lands
are
in
side
of
acreage
in
1953
under
the
bureau
of
land
management
statistics.
there
are
over
a
hundred
--
783
oil
and
gas
leases
not
offers
that
were
outstanding
in
alaska
embracing
over
one
man
and
378,000
acres
yet
at
that
time
there
were
no
lease
offers
of
any
sort
in
this
area.
now
in
1955,
department
issued
public
land
order
1212
which
revokes
the
earlier
1948
public
land
order
487
with
regard
to
the
accepted
area.
we
have
treated
the
language
of
this
public
land
order
1212
in
our
brief.
we
think
it's
quite
clear
that
it
was
intended
from
the
language
to
show
that
it
had
been
closed
the
mineral
leasing
prior
to
september
1955.
we
now
further
we
think
this
is
shown
that
a
fact
that
after
1955
all
of
these
leases
were
issued
in
this
area,
yet
there
were
two
that
were
issued
prior
to
1212.
the
government
had
admitted
that
these
were
perhaps
mistakes,
so
all
of
the
leases
were
issued
after
public
land
order
1212.
this
we
submit
is
a
practice
to
show
that
in
effect
they
were
considering
the
accepted
areas
closed
until
after
the
1955
order
of
1212
opened
it.
now,
on
december
of
1955,
the
government
issued
new
general
regulations
pertaining
to
wildlife
refuges
throughout
the
country.
the
government
now
seems
to
base
its
whole
case
on
this
and
argues
that
these
‘55
regulations
confirmed
the
preexisting
status
of
the
kenai
range
is
open.
we
say
if
there's
anything
at
all
clear
about
this
1955
regulations,
it's
that
they
can't
confirm
the
status
of
the
kenai
range
one
way
or
the
other.
the
‘55
regulations
had
two
appendices.
appendix
a
listed
certain
wildlife
refuges
which
would've
thereafter
be
closed
to
oil
and
gas
leasing.
and
appendix
b,
listed
other
wildlife
areas
throughout
the
country
or
portions
of
wildlife
areas
which
would've
thereafter
be
available
for
leasing
only
on
a
detail
operating
program
for
the
protection
of
the
wildlife.
now,
we
check
the
refuges
which
were
included
in
the
category
a
and
found
that
a
great
number
of
these
whereby
their
very
terms
opened
to
mineral
leasing.
therefore
appendix
a
to
‘55
regulation
closed
certain
lands
that
were
otherwise
opened
by
the
terms
of
their
orders.
similarly,
in
appendix
b
there
were
great
number
of
refuges
or
portion
of
refuges
with
language
somewhat
similar
to
the
kenai
as
well
as
the
salt
plains
refuge
in
1943
which
on
anybody's
language
was
closed
to
mineral
leasing
by
the
terms
of
its
order
yet
appendix
b
apparently
opens
some
of
these
refuges
which
were
otherwise
closed.
well,
if
appendix
a
closes
some
refuges
that
are
opened
and
appendix
b
opens
some
refuges
which
by
their
terms
were
close,
it's
clear
that
the
1955
regulation
can't
be
a
determination
of
the
preexisting
status
of
any
of
the
wildlife
refugees.
now,
beyond
that,
we
submit,
there
are
three
possible
interpretations
of
the
‘55
regulations.
first,
it's
possible
that
it
didn't
affect
any
of
the
lands
unless
they're
in
mention
which
now
the
lands
in
this
case
were,
if
by
the
terms
of
their
order
they
were
previously
closed.
in
other
words,
under
this
interpretation,
the
‘55
regulation
would
be
the
same
as
the
1947
regulation
which
was
general
and
didn't
affect
any
refugees
which
were
closed.
now,
the
government
argues
this
can't
be
so
because
appendix
b
mentioned
certain
areas
in
the
kenai
range
now
involved
in
this
case
which
were
mere
lease
in
rivers.
the
government
said,
“this
is
where
the
moose
are
apt
to
be”
and
this
makes
it
clear
that
the
rest
of
the
area
must
have
been
opened.
we
submit
that
this
is
a
false
factual
assumption
that
has
no
basis
in
the
record.
we
have
a
map.
we
have
since
last
thursday
to
check
the
official
u.s.
geological
survey
map
of
the
kenai
area
having
a
copy
distributed
to
each
member
of
the
court.
this
map
here,
the
map
that
is
shown
here
is
simply
an
exploded
version
of
large
area
embracing
most
of
the
closed
area.
it's
quite
clear
from
this
map
that
almost
the
entire
kenai
range
is
just
pack
marked
with
lakes
and
swamps.
it'd
be
almost
impossible
to
say
that
if
water
is
a
prerequisite
for
moose
that
there
is
anywhere
in
this
range
that
they
wouldn't
have
plenty
of
water.
now,
the
second
possible
interpretation
of
the
1955
regulation
is
that
the
appendix
b
procedures
therein
described,
apply
to
the
whole
of
the
closed
area.
we
say
the
government
in
effect
so
construed
the
matter
because
in
its
action
regarding
the
swanson
river
unit.
the
swanson
river
unit
which
was
issued
on
leases
in
1956
was
only
issued
after
compliance
with
appendix
b
procedures,
the
special
detail
operative
procedures
which
appendix
b
of
the
‘55
regulation
required.
but
it
was
applied
to
this
area
where
the
swanson
river
unit
is
not
within
the
designated
portions
of
the
range
required
for
appendix
b
procedures.
this
action
we
submitted
of
requiring
appendix
b
procedures
for
lands
not
so
designated
raises
the
possible
inference
of
the
‘55
regulation
could
be
interpreted
as
though
the
appendix
b
procedures
were
required
for
all
of
these
area.
but
if
that's
so,
the
department
has
acted
inconsistently
with
the
‘55
regulation
because
under
appendix
b
procedures
it
expressly
provides
that
all
pending
applications
will
be
rejected
within
unless
within
six
months
the
applicant
files
an
operating
program
sufficient
to
accomplish
these
purposes.
now,
none
of
the
other
leases
in
this
area
were
rejected
yet
if
the
appendix
b
procedures
are
to
govern,
they
should've
been.
a
third
possible
interpretation
of
the
‘55
regulations
is
that
they
intended
to
open
the
range
for
the
first
time
to
oil
and
gas
leasing.
there
is
some
support
for
this
in
the
congressional
legislative
history
in
1956
at
102
cong.
rec.
250
to
256
in
1956
and
house
range
on
h.r.5306
at
pages
138
through
173.
but
we
submit
that
regardless
of
which
interpretation
is
correct
of
the
1955
regulations,
none
of
them
helped
the
adverse
holders
of
leases
in
the
present
case
because
all
their
lease
offers
were
filed
prior
to
the
1955
regulations
and
there's
no
answer
to
say
that
the
secretary
can't
open
or
close
a
refuge
by
any
thing
other
than
the
public
land
order.
he
has
done
it
expressly
a
number
of
times
by
general
regulations.
now,
in
1956,
the
suspension
order
was
reimposed.
it
was
asked
before
the
general
suspension
order
and
only
applicable
based
on
the
departments
on
acknowledgement
to
those
wildlife
areas
which
were
open
to
oil
and
gas
leasing.
therefore,
the
‘56
suspension
order
at
that
time,
which
was
‘56
could've
been
applicable
to
the
blue
area
and
the
green
area.
now,
the
leases
issued
prior
to
1958
by
the
department
in
the
kenai
range
we
show
--
we
submit,
show
that
the
department
treated
the
whole
area
which
was
we
say
was
closed
quite
differently
from
the
accepted
area
which
we
--
anybody's
terms
is
open
since
1955.
now,
under
the
government's
theory
of
this
case,
there
has
been
absolutely
no
reason
whatsoever
to
draw
any
distinction
between
this
area
and
this
area.
on
the
government's
theory
both
areas
were
closed
all
the
time.
but
look
what
happened.
prior
to
1958
leases
were
issued
in
the
accepted
area
right
here.
it's
obvious
that
the
department
was
paying
a
considerable
amount
of
attention
to
the
line
which
segregated
the
open
area
which
was
opened
from
the
first,
from
the
closed
area
and
they
so
treated
it
administratively
down
here
in
accepted
area.
a
number
of
leases
were
issued
prior
to
1958
right
up
to
the
boundaries
of
the
close,
both
areas
of
the
range.
in
1958,
the
government
--
the
secretary
issued
new
comprehensive
regulations
where
everyone
is
in
agreement
that
these
were
designed
to
make
a
comprehension
--
comprehensive
revision
of
all
wildlife
orders
throughout
the
country.
now,
under
this
‘58
regulations,
all
wildlife
areas
in
the
united
states
under
the
--
even
those
as
the
order
expressly
stated
which
by
the
terms
of
their
order
were
left
opened,
were
closed
to
oil
and
gas
leasing.
the
‘58
regulations,
however,
with
respect
to
alaska
wildlife
refugees
provided
that
these
would
thereafter
be
opened
to
oil
and
gas
leasing
only
after
a
detail
operating
program
had
been
worked
out
between
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
in
the
director
of
bureau
of
land
management
for
the
protection
of
wildlife
values.
in
january
of
1958,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
classified
the
kenai
moose
range
under
the
‘58
regulations,
he
stated,
this
is
at
page
15
of
the
record.
i
have
approved
this
week
a
classification
of
the
kenai
moose
range
in
the
territory
of
alaska
which
delineates
those
areas
which
will
be
opened
and
close
to
development.
and
further,
i'm
assured
by
assistant
secretary
leffler
that
this
action
opening
a
portion
of
the
kenai
range
subject
to
the
proposed
regulated
development
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
primary
purpose
for
which
the
range
is
managed.
he
went
on
thereafter
to
describe
the
classification
procedures
that
still
had
to
be
worked
out
between
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
in
the
bureau
of
land
management
prior
at
the
time
that
an
order
could
be
issued
whereby
the
lands
could
be
leased.
on
august
1958,
the
secretary
announced
the
final
publication
of
the
agreement
in
map
for
the
protection
of
wildlife
which
had
been
worked
out
under
the
‘58
regulations
for
the
protection
of
fish
and
wildlife.
now,
this
august
2,
1958
set
up
a
specific
procedure
for
the
filing
of
lease
offers
on
the
areas
which
were
at
that
point
open
to
oil
and
gas
leasing.
the
‘58
order
also
embraced
the
two
accepted
areas
of
the
range
for
within
which
there
were
oil
and
gas
leasing
and
for
that
reason,
there
was
provision
in
the
‘58
order,
we
submit,
for
treatment
of
suspended
orders
because
those
where
the
only
two
areas
that
were
opened
and
which
there
could
be
valid
suspended
orders.
now,
the
respondents
in
this
case
while
their
lease
offers
pursuant
to
the
expressed
terms
of
this
august
2,
1958
order
for
these
lands
after
august
14
which
was
the
day
that
the
order
specified
orders
could
be
filed.
we
submit
that
the
crowning
factual
aspect
of
the
case
is
that
three
weeks
after
these
lease
offers
were
filed
and
without
notice
to
the
respondents
the
department
issued
leases
in
this
area
without
notice
to
us
to
the
adverse
holders
based
on
their
1954
and
1955
offers
and
a
year
later
in
september
of
1959,
the
department
held
a
drawing
which
have
been
required
in
the
august
2
order
to
determine
priority
of
all
of
those
who
would
file
under
the
‘58
order.
now,
under
the
department
regulations
drawing
is
not
for
the
determining
the
order
of
processing
but
to
determine
the
order
of
priority
among
conflicting
applicants.
at
the
drawing,
the
respondents
were
chosen
first
but
when
they
were
--
they
were
notified
just
a
week
later
or
several
weeks
after
that
that
their
offers
were
rejected
because
based
upon
prior
leases
that
have
been
issued
a
year
earlier.
we
submit
that
the
drawing
held
in
september
of
1959
was
obviously
just
a
window
dressing
because
at
that
time
the
department
had
leased
the
whole,
as
shown
from
the
map
at
least
the
whole
area
which
would
be
subject
to
last
to
be
held
in
the
drawing.
in
conclusion,
i'd
like
to
say
that
the
case
appears
to
us
to
boil
down
to
proposition
of
whether
the
respondents
who
relied
on
the
terms
of
the
published
executive
order
creating
the
kenai
national
range
are
to
be
deprived
of
their
rights
by
others
who
are
head
of
the
time
for
the
--
accepting
of
offers
in
the
area
and
many
years
prior
at
the
time
that
any
detailed
operating
procedures
will
work
out
for
the
protection
of
wildlife
entered
this
range.
we
think
our
apropo
here
is
maybe
a
famous
example
on
american
public
land
history.
back
in
the
19th
century
with
the
opening
of
the
oklahoma
territory
a
specific
time
was
set
where
the
settlers
to
goo
across
the
line
in
to
the
new
territory.
u.s.
army
patrolled
the
borders
and
make
sure
that
no
one
at
that
time
crossed
over
and
tell
the
given
hour
after
which
there
was
a
large
rush
in
to
the
area.
however,
several
weeks
or
months
or
earlier
than
that,
some
people
had
gone
across
into
this
oklahoma
territory
and
state
out
claims
on
very
valuable
lands.
to
this
day,
those
people
are
known
as
sooners
and
a
sooner
is
still
defined
today
as
a
person
who
enters
an
area
prior
to
that
time
that
is
lawfully
opened
and
attempt
to
gain
in
unlawful
privilege
as
against
others.
we
believe
that
the
applicants
in
this
case
adverse
to
the
respondents
are
sooners
and
in
fairness
and
in
justice,
we
submit,
they
should
not
prevail.
