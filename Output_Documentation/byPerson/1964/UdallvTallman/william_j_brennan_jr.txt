except
for
those
areas
two
and
three
that
were
pulled
out
later.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
is
white
up
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
be
like
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
clear
about
this.
on
my
map
is
there's
a
white
area
here
which
you
have
an
arrow
and
on
the
left
we
have
a
blue
area.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
segment
which
is
white
in
the
right,
the
blue
on
the
left
is
under
lease
now,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
procedure's
at
all
relevant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
government's
case
in,
don't
accept
it
but
i
don't
think
they
come
out
of
the
interpretation
made
by
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
trying
to
(voice
overlap),
does
it
then
come
down
to
whether
we
agree
or
not
in
view
which
words
on
as
far
as
argument
but
before
as
to
the
effect.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
--
this
is
1954?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
richfield
a
respondent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
noticed
mr.
barnett
in
the
brief
amicus,
one
of
the
point
is
that
they're
irresponsible
parties.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
they
try
to
get
in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
when
that
is
done,
many
of
these
stopped
filing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
secretary
by
this
1943
action
was
given
the
power
to
revoke?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
effective
order.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that's
the
1943
that
you
mentioned
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
see
if
i
got
the
statement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
executive
order,
the
basic
one
was
1941.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
as
i
understood
you
earlier
what
happened
in
1943
had
the
effect
of
delegating
the
power
to
the
secretary
to
do
all
these
things.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
included
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
these
regulations
came
along
in
1947
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
we
have
been
talking
about.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
now
you're
at
the
1955?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
would
pass
1947,
we're
now
on
1955?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
these
filings
griffin
would
probably
call
when
they
came
in
1956?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
before
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
barnett,
i
just
want
to
ask,
when
was
the
actual
leasing
made?
before
or
after
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
we're
still
not
up
to
the
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
are
making
the
argument,
are
you
making
that
--
are
you
making
that
argument
that
that
last
sentence
would
set
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
actions
shall
now
be
taken
on
pending
that
itself
confirm
that
the
secretary
was
in
the
view
and
that
at
the
time
of
the
filing
the
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
lease
is
open
to
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
don't
think
you
can
read
such
no
other
disposition.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
even
so
mr.
barnett,
if
you've
got
an
argument,
you'll
argue
usually
generously.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
can
ignore
it
except
the
fish
trap
sites
but
not
give
some
color
on
whether
this
disposition
made.
