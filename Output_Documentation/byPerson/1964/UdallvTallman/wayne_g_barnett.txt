mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1920
authorizes
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
issue
oil
and
gas
leases
on
the
public
lands.
by
its
terms,
that
statute
is
fully
applicable
to
areas
that
have
been
withdrawn
or
set
aside
for
use
as
wildlife
refuges.
this
case
involves
the
validity
of
oil
and
gas
leases
issued
by
the
secretary
of
interior
under
that
act
and
the
kenai
national
moose
range
in
alaska.
at
page
17
of
the
record,
you'll
find
a
map
of
the
kenai
peninsula
and
the
insert
at
the
lower
right
shows
the
relationship
of
the
peninsula
to
alaska.
the
larger
map
shows
the
boundaries
of
the
moose
range
on
the
peninsula.
the
moose
range
was
created
in
1941
by
order
of
president
roosevelt
which
set
it
aside
for
the
use
by
the
department
of
the
interior
as
a
refuge
for
wildlife,
primarily
for
the
giant
kenai
moose.
this
large
exhibit
involves
and
furnished
to
do
with
individual
copies
of
the
same
exhibit
for
your
convenience
but
it
shows
the
moose
range
divided
into
three
separate
parts.
each
of
which
has
a
somewhat
different
status.
the
one
on
the
right,
that
large
area
which
we
have
labeled
area
one
was
withdrawn
by
the
original
executive
order
1941,
executive
order
8979
withdrew
that
area
and
only
that
area
from
a
settlement,
location,
sale
or
entry
or
other
disposition.
and
the
basic
question
in
the
case
will
be
what
that
means.
the
two
areas
on
the
right
--
i'm
sorry,
on
the
left,
your
left
were
accepted
from
the
original
order.
however,
the
one
on
the
bottom
which
we
call
area
two
was
seven
years
later
withdrawn
by
a
public
land
order
issued
by
the
secretary
of
interior
is
at
that
time
was
withdrawn
from
settlement
location,
sale
or
entry.
the
third
area,
top
on
the
left,
area
three,
was
never
withdrawn
by
either
order.
it
in
fact
is
wholly
irrelevant
to
this
case
and
we
have
it
there
only
for
the
sake
of
completeness
and
i
won't
--
again
refer
to
it.
the
colored
areas
on
the
map
represent
oil
and
gas
leases,
leases
issued
by
the
secretary
of
the
department
of
interior,
all
on
applications
which
were
filed
during
1954
and
1955.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
all
the
colors.
the
lease
--
the
difference
in
the
colors
is
the
time
the
leases
were
issued.
the
applications
were
all
filed
at
the
same
time.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
sorry?
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
white
portions
are
not
leased.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
they
were
also
leased
and
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
some
of
it
is
white,
that's
right.
any
area
that
is
not
colored
was
never
leased
or
at
least
not
leased
to
an
irrelevant
period.
it
may
have
been
subsequently.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
arrows
i've
exploded
in
the
map.
this
--
the
three
areas
are
in
fact
all
contiguous.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
and
i've
separated
them
out
for
ease
of
reference.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
arrows
--
the
arrows
show
where
they
fit
together.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
this
white
area
down
here.
all
of
that
area
has
not
been
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
most
of
it
is
colored.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
but
with
this
belongs
over
here,
alright,
i
just
moved
it
over
to
separate
the
areas
visually.
and
this
belongs
in
here.
now,
the
area
that
was
leased
and
the
areas
were
--
we're
concerned
as
i
say
only
with
this
large
area
and
the
small
area
two.
and
the
areas
that
were
leased
and
those
two
areas
total
about
800,000
acres
which
is
about
1,300
square
miles.
it's
a
very
large
area.
the
black
dots
which
are
clustered
mostly
up
here
and
there
are
few
down
in
area
two.
those
represent
producing
oil
or
gas
wells
that
have
been
brought
in
under
the
leases.
their
first
oil
discovery
was
in
1957,
july
of
1957.
and
the
productions
today
have
been
substantial
and
the
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
perhaps
aggregated
in
about
a
$100
million.
the
reserves,
the
proven
reserves,
have
been
estimated
at
$1
billion.
i
might
also
say
that
the
90%
of
the
royalties
and
rents
under
the
leases
are
paid
to
alaska,
the
state
of
alaska,
and
are
very
significant
part
of
that
state's
revenues.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
90%.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
90%.
now,
what
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
held
in
this
case
and
in
fact
was
that
all
of
those
leases
were
invalidly
issued
and
are
nullities.
and
that
is
why
we
brought
the
case
here.
now,
the
case
--
the
land
is
actually
in
issue
in
the
particular
case
are
these
crosshatched
area,
in
area
one
that
includes
nine
blocks
of
four
sections
each,
it's
a
total
of
about
36
square
miles.
also
in
issue
are
in
scattered
figures
which
are
also
crosshatched
in
area
two,
they
total
only
about
2,000
square
miles.
those
are
the
lands
which
responded
coyle
in
this
case
seeks.
the
other
nine
respondents,
respondent
tallman
and
the
other
eight
are
concerned
only
with
the
land
in
the
large
area.
i
think
it's
agreed
that
if
the
nine
respondents
are
not
entitled
to
leases
in
the
large
area,
respondent
coyle
has
a
fortiori
not
entitled
to
a
lease
in
the
smaller
area
two.
now,
solely
for
purposes
of
simplifying
the
case
as
much
as
possible,
i
will
confine
my
detailed
statement
and
argument
to
the
large
area
on
the
right,
the
case
involving
the
nine
respondents.
but
what
happened
was
that
in
october
1954
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
was
the
draftsman's
own
innovation
--
i'm
sorry.
the
difference
of
color
is
insignificant.
the
difference
in
shading
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
the
dark
color
as
opposed
to
light
colors
is
their
difference
in
time
that
the
leases
were
issued.
the
applications
were
filed
at
the
same
time.
the
leases
were
issued
at
different
times.
specifically,
i'll
come
to
this,
this
area,
this
dark
area
up
here
is
called
the
swanson
river
unit
was
leased
in
1956.
the
rest
of
the
area,
all
of
this
light
orange
was
not
leased
until
about
september
1958.
the
reasons
are
later
explained
why
that
leasing
was
delayed.
but
the
applications
were
all
about
the
same
time
and
the
issue
really
is
the
status
of
the
lands
when
the
applications
were
filed.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
when
--
which?
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
this
is
area
was
leased
at
the
same
time
that
all
of
these
other
area
was
leased.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
there's
one
dot,
there
which
is
a
--
that's
a
producing
gas
well.
the
other
dot
is
a
dry
hole.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right,
that's
right.
and
that
isn't
--
that
is
not
within
these
leases.
that's
just
beyond
the
boarder
of
these
leases.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
that
in
nine
--
october
1954,
between
october
1954
and
january
1955,
three-month
period,
applications
for
lease
were
filed
on
this
area
in
controversy
by
--
when
d.j.
griffin
and
various
other
persons.
for
convenience,
i'll
refer
to
them
all
as
the
griffin
group.
the
applications
were
accepted
for
filing
and
initially
processed.
however,
final
action
was
not
taken
because
an
internal
instruction
had
been
sent
out
to
withhold
final
action
in
all
leasing
applications
pending
a
study
and
revision
of
the
leasing
regulations.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
i
think
at
one
point,
at
one
point
an
argument
was
made
about
the
suspension
order,
the
instruction
not
to
take
final
action.
i
think
that
has
been
abandoned
by
the
respondents
and
i
think
it's
now
agreed
that
that
was
simply
an
internal
instruction
since
a
hold
up
because
we're
studying
the
regulations.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
it
is
in
coordinate
--
in
the
chronology
of
the
findings
by
the
respondents.
these
leases
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
that
determines
this
--
that
their
argument
is
that
at
that
time
the
range
was
closed
to
leasing
and
the
applications
were
invalid.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
because
they
say
they
weren't
acted
on
immediately
and
almost
four
years
later,
in
august
of
1958,
the
respondents
top
file,
they
filed
applications
on
the
same
lands
in
august
of
1958.
a
month
or
two
after
that,
final
action
was
taken
and
the
leases
were
issued
to
the
original
applicants,
the
griffin
applicants.
and
in
due
course,
the
respondent's
top
file
applications
were
rejected.
they
then
brought
this
suit
against
the
secretary
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
to
require
him
in
effect
to
issue
the
leases
to
them.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
respondent
--
for
the
secretary.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
was
that
the
executive
order
that
created
the
range
in
1941
which
withdrew
the
lands
from
settlement
location,
sale
or
entry
or
other
disposition
whose
other
language
i'll
deal
with
later,
in
effect
closed
the
area
to
leasing
it,
prohibited
leasing
in
that
area
and
so
the
earlier
applications
were
invalidly
filed
and
the
leases
issued
on
them
were
nullities.
now,
it
also
held
that
the
--
some
regulations
which
i'll
come
to
later
also,
they
were
issued
in
1958
and
an
implementing
order
have
the
effect
of
opening
the
range
to
leasing
and
therefore,
the
--
the
tallman
group
as
those
first
to
file
after
the
range
was
opened,
became
entitled
to
the
leases.
now,
i
already
generally
--
the
ultimate
question
is
the
interpretation
of
the
executive
order.
but
that
is
not
a
question
to
be
decided
by
the
court
in
the
first
instance.
the
secretary's
interpretation
is
reasonable.
it
is
not
capricious
and
arbitrary.
i
think
it's
settled
that
his
interpretation
must
be
upheld.
and
so
i
first
want
to
establish
what
his
interpretation
was
to
both
by
his
consistent
practice
in
administering
the
range
and
by
regulations.
now,
we
would
then
examine
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
sorry?
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
1941
order,
i
would
talk
only
about
1941
order
and
this
large
area
of
the
range
on
the
right.t
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
as
the
case
has
been
argued,
it
does.
there
are
some
other
arguments
i
think
very
strong
ones
why
even
so
tallman
will
not
be
entitled
to
the
leases.
we
have
not
made
them
and
think
to
say
we've
made
them
primarily
because
we
are
confidence
in
the
basic
issue
and
we
didn't
want
to
complicate
the
case.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
as
to
the
effect
of
the
1941
executive
order.
but
as
i
say
one
has
to
give
great
deference
in
that
to
the
secretary's
consistent
application
of
it.
now,
i
might
briefly
--
i
told
you
generally
that
the
leasing
practices
that
occurred.
i
might
briefly
explain
why
the
sequence
of
them.
in
october
1954,
prior
then
that
no
significant
leasing
action
had
occurred,
so
it
all
started
in
october
1954,
when
richfield
oil
corporation
filed
applications
on
this
area
up
here,
the
dark
orange
area
which
is
known
as
the
swanson
river
unit.
now,
when
the
word
got
out
that
richfield
was
filing
apparently
because
the
oil
companies
don't
file
unless
they
have
good
reasons
to
think
that
there's
oil,
there
was
a
land
rush
on
the
office
and
within
the
next
few
months,
applications
were
filed
covering
the
whole
range.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
this
is
october
1954
through
the
spring
of
1955,
alright.
april
1955
is
about
the
last
application.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
richfield
is
not
a
respondent.
the
--
none
of
the
holders
of
the
leases
are
parties
in
the
case.
they
did
file
briefs
as
amicus
curiae,
both
richfield
and
other
oil
companies
that
have
since
been
assigned
that
the
lease
is
an
issue.
so
the
leases
issued
to
the
griffin
application,
the
griffin
applicants
were
later
working
at
these
or
the
leases
themselves
were
later
assigned
to
some
oil
companies
with
sufficient
capital
to
develop
them.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
the
respondents
are
individuals
at
least
this
respondent
tallman.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
they
don't,
they
don't.
the
applications
filed
by
them
were
in
their
own
names
as
individuals.
they
haven't
gotten
them
yet.
if
they
get
them,
they're
free
to
assign
them
to
an
oil
company
and
might
very
well
do
so.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
that's
right.
it's
the
oil
and
gas
lease.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
application.
that's
right.
now
it's
agreed
that
somebody
get
to
this.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
no,
no.
they're
not
there
to
protect
the
moves
and
sometimes
it
seems
to
suggest
they
are.
they
want
the
leases
instead
of
the
griffin
application.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
they,
i
don't
want
to
get
into
that
controversy.
they
were
not
given
a
notice
in
the
suit
in
the
district
court.
they
did
participate
in
the
administrative
proceedings.
they
weren't
served
their
all
--
all
of
the
existing
lessees.
according
to
the
amici,
they
didn't
hear
about
this
suit
until
after
the
court
of
appeals
decision
was
announced
at
the
first
time,
and
they
were
never
joined.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
think
probably
the
result
was
there'd
be
some
more
litigation.
i
hope
we'll
win
and
stop
the
litigation,
that's
why
we're
here.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
the
--
as
i
say,
the
range
was
covered
with
applications
in
1954
and
1955.
but
action
was
--
the
final
action,
they
were
exempted
for
filing
but
filed
action
on
the
application
was
withheld
under
this
suspension
directive
not
to
take
file
action
because
of
a
possible
revision
of
regulations.
and
there
the
matter
stood
until
1956.
in
1956,
some
bills
were
introduced
in
congress
to
restrict
by
statute
leasing
in
wildlife
refuges.
this
is
across
the
country
not
just
the
moose
range.
the
committees
did
not
report
out
the
bills.
however,
the
house
committee
noted
in
its
report
that
an
understanding
had
been
reached
between
the
committee
and
the
secretary
whereby
the
secretary
would
not
issue
any
more
leases
in
wildlife
refuges
without
first
advising
the
committee
and
asking
for
its
approval.
so,
in
july
1956
--
june
1956,
the
secretary
submitted
to
the
committee
a
proposal
to
lease,
to
issue
leases
on
the
swanson
river
unit.
that's
the
dark
area
up
at
the
top.
the
committee
held
public
hearings
on
the
proposal
and
ultimately
in
july,
advised
the
secretary
by
letter
that
the
committee
was
in
unanimous
agreement
that
issuing
those
leases
would
not
be
detrimental
to
wildlife
uses
and
they
might
properly
go
ahead
and
issue
those
leases
without
awaiting
the
final
resolution
of
the
policies
generally
to
be
followed.
so
in
september
1956,
leases
in
fact
were
issued
in
the
swanson
river
unit
which
is
the
dark
area
on
the
top.
that's
a
large
area
at
71,000
acres
over
100
square
miles.
now,
under
those
leases
oil
was
discovered
in
july
1957.
that
was
responsible
--
that
discovery
lead
to
the
development
of
this
oil
field
which
is
shown
by
the
custard
dots.
and
mind
you,
all
of
these
was
during
the
time
that
the
court
of
appeals
holds
that
the
range
was
closed
leasing.
now,
the
next
thing
that
happened
is
that
in
1958,
the
new
set
of
regulations
was
finally
issued
in
an
implementing
order
specifically
applicable
to
the
kenai
range
was
issued
which
became
effective
august
14th.
now,
what
the
order
did
was
to
in
effect,
we
--
well,
we
say
what
it
did
was
to
close
the
lower
half
of
the
range.
it
forbad
any
leasing
at
all.
and
this
part
of
the
range
down
at
the
bottom
is
outlined
in
the
heavy
line
also
in
a
small
piece
over
the
top.
but
it
directed
that
the
pending
applications
now
be
acted
on
and
so
promptly
after
that,
they
acted
on
all
the
pending
applications
and
then
in
the
next
few
months
issued,
i
think
it's
294
leases
covering
620,000
acres
on
the
application
that
have
been
filed
back
in
1954
or
1955,
leasing
thereby
substantially
the
whole
range
that
was
still
available
for
leasing.
among
those
leases
were
the
leases
involved
in
this
case
issued
to
the
griffin
applicants
and
the
status
then
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
status
of
all
of
the
other
leases
that
were
issued
at
that
time.
now,
i
would
like
--
i
think
just
that
practice
alone
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
on
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
when
the
--
the
regulations
of
1958
were
issued
in
january
8.
at
that
time
they
forbid
any
further
filings
and
said
that
the
pending
offers
shall
continue
to
be
suspended
until
this
later
order
which
was
issued
in
august
2nd
of
1958.
so
for
an
eight
--
eight-month
period
no
filings
were
permissible.
when
the
new
order
came
out,
it
said
that
this
bottom
half
is
closed
leasing,
the
top
half
may
be
leased
and
new
offers
may
now
be
filed,
starting
10
days
from
the
time
it's
recorded
which
was
august
14th
and
for
a
10-day
period
after,
that
all
new
offers
will
be
treated
as
simultaneously
filed.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
this
is
a
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
order
of
the
secretary.
i
might
explain
that
justice
clark.
the
original
withdrawal
was
by
an
executive
order
signed
by
the
president.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
8979.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it's
still
in
effect,
still
in
effect.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
their
argument
is
that
this
1958
order
modified
the
executive
order
which
the
secretary
has
powered
to
do.
i
might
explain
that.
you
will
know
that
the
original
withdrawals
by
an
executive
order
and
the
withdrawals
of
area
two
and
50
--
48
was
by
a
public
land
order.
what
happened
was
the
--
such
withdrawals
were
formally
always
signed
by
the
president
and
were
executive
orders.
in
1943,
this
president
delegated
the
function
to
the
secretary
and
thereafter
the
secretary
has
the
plenary
power
to
make
withdrawals
and
to
modify
the
existing
withdrawals.
and
the
secretary
could
have
revoked
the
executive
order
it
will.
and
in
fact,
the
executive
order
became
the
secretary's
order
in
1943
and
there's
really
no
difference
in
the
status
between
it
and
the
public
land
order
that
was
later
issued
in
this
small
area.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
that's
the
respondent's
argument
that
the
1958
order
for
the
first
time
that
the
executive
order
closed
its
leasing.
in
the
1958
order
from
the
first
time
opened
it
by
modifying
the
executive
order.
i
might
know
by
the
way
that
the
delegation
of
authority
to
the
president
is
quoted
at
102
of
the
record.
the
relevant
part
of
it
is,
it's
not
quoted
in
our
brief
unfortunately,
and
it
said
that
all
orders
issued
by
the
secretary
under
the
authority
of
this
order
shall
be
designated
as
public
land
orders.
now,
i'm
not
arguing
that
--
that
a
regulation
couldn't
be
given
effect
as
the
modification
of
any
existing
withdrawal.
in
fact,
however,
when
the
secretary
thinks
that's
what
he's
doing
he
does
it
by
public
land
orders.
that's
what
the
delegation
of
authorities
said
he
should
do.
and
as
--
when
he
withdrew
this
area
two,
he
did
it
by
public
land
order
and
in
the
briefs
of
the
amici
you
will
find
lists
and
lists
of
public
land
orders
and
that's
what
he
does
when
he
means
to
alter
a
withdrawal.
what
we
will
argue
is
that
the
regulations
weren't
--
didn't
--
weren't
intended
to
modify
the
executive
order.
they
simply
reflect
the
longstanding
interpretation
of
the
executive
order
as
never
having
part
of
any
leasing.
now,
the
regulation,
i'd
like
to
go
back
a
bit
on
the
regulation
that
the
1955
version
of
the
regulations,
we
think
at
equally
confirmation
of
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
executive
order.
the
regulations
begin
at
page
3a
of
the
government's
brief,
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief.
now,
what
the
regulations
are
the
mineral
leasing
act
itself
applies
to
wildlife
refuges
generally.
but
it's
not
mandatory,
it
just
gives
the
secretary
the
power
and
he
therefore
has
discretion
to
limit
leasing
any
place
in
the
public
domain
and
this
regulation
states
the
departmental
policy
on
leasing
in
wildlife
refuges.
there's
no
doubt
he
has
the
power
so
to
limit
or
control
leasing
in
wildlife
refuges.
so
the
original
one
was
issued
1947
and
it
said
very
little.
it
simply
said
that
oil
and
gas
--
that
no
oil
and
gas
leases
may
be
issued
in
the
wildlife
refuge
unless
it's
subject
to
a
unit
plan
and
no
drilling
or
prospecting
under
the
lease
may
be
conducted
without
the
consent
of
the
secretary
on
the
advice
of
the
fish
and
wildlife
service.
now,
as
i
say
in
1953,
august
of
1953,
they
took
under
--
or
they
took
under
advisement
and
study
whether
they
shouldn't
revise
the
leasing
policies
and
restrict
leasing
in
wildlife
refuges.
i
might
say
the
evolution
of
these
regulations
can
be
seen
as
a
competing
forces
between
those
who
are
in
favor
of
conservation
and
those
who
are
in
favor
of
development
of
minerals.
and
even
to
say,
they
have
quite
different
views
about
the
extent
to
which
leasing
is
compatible
with
wildlife
uses.
and
i
might
anticipate
the
end
by
saying
that
ultimately
the
conservation
has
went
out.
and
except
for
alaska,
the
new
regulations
would
bid
leasing
altogether
in
wildlife
refuges
but
i'll
come
to
that.
now,
in
1955,
a
new
version
of
the
regulation
was
issued
in
december
8,
1955.
and
it's
set
out
on
page
4a
and
5a
of
our
appendix
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
this
because
it's
the
first
formal
document
of
the
secretary
which
expressly,
we
think,
or
virtually
expressly
does
treat
the
range
as
open
to
leasing.
the
operative
provision
is
paragraph
b
and
it
treats
with
three
categories
of
lands.
the
first
sentence
says
that
areas
determined
to
be
indispensable
for
the
preservation
of
endangered
species
and
the
like
are
not
available
for
leasing
at
all,
and
areas
in
that
category
are
included
in
appendix
a.
and
appendix
a,
they
enlisted
a
few,
did
not
mention
kenai
range.
the
next
sentence
begins,
“oil
and
gas
leases
may
be
issued
for
other
lands
administered
by
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
for
wildlife
conservation.”
now,
i
would
like
to
stop
there
for
a
moment,
it
goes
on
to
say
that
literally
that
would
include
the
moose
range.
it
says,
“any
areas
administered
by
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
for
wildlife
conservation,”
and
it
goes
on,
“except
that”.
what
follows
is
an
exception
from
that
statement
that
leases
may
be
issued,
“except
that
on
those
areas
designated
by
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
as
wilderness,
recreational,
water
development
or
marsh
with
respect
to
which
it
determines
that
oil
and
gas
development
might
seriously
impair
or
destroy
the
usefulness
of
the
lands
for
wildlife
conservation
purposes,
no
leases
will
be
issued
unless
the
service
first
approves
a
detailed
program
together
with
safeguards.”
areas
in
this
category
are
listed
in
appendix
b
and
over
in
the
next
page
5a,
appendix
b
includes
this
item,
kenai.
the
following
areas
in
all
lands
within
one
mile
of
tustumena
lake,
skilak
lake,
kenai
river,
upper
and
lower
russian
lake
--
river,
hidden
lake,
kasilof
river,
and
chickaloon
flat.
those
parts
all
within
the
range
of
--
some
of
them
show
in
the
map.
they're
all
within
the
range
were
designated
mind
you,
to
exempt
them
from
provision
that
oil
and
gas
leases
may
be
issued.
they
were
designated
as
areas
in
which
leasing
might
seriously
impair
or
destroy
wildlife
conservation.
now,
i
suggest
that
it
make
--
it
would
make
a
certainty
of
the
regulation
if
they
did
not
necessarily
assume
that
the
whole
range
was
open
to
leasing
and
it
was
accepting
the
rivers,
lakes,
and
marshlands
as
areas
in
which
because
of
their
special
sensitivity
that's
where
fish
and
wildlife
are
bound,
no
leasing
will
be
permitted
except
on
a
very
stringent
conditions.now
what
the
respondent
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
executive
order
--
and
that's
involved
here
executive
order
8979
had
not
been
amended.
there
was
another
executive
order
that
generally
delegated
the
power
to
make
withdrawals
throughout
the
united
states.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
to
the
secretary.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
since
1943
the
secretary
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
all
over
--
all
over
the
country.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
general
delegation
–-
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
this
order,
this
order
is
subject
to
this
amendment.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
first
wildlife
leasing
up
here.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
now
on
the
1955
regulations.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
right.
and
the
1947
regulation
did
not
mention
any
range
by
name.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
what
i
say
is
significant
about
1955
is
that
it
does
mention
a
certain
part
in
the
kenai
range,
the
lakes,
rivers
and
marshlands.
and
it
mentions
them
for
the
purpose
of
accepting
them
from
the
provision
where
it
says
oil
and
gas
leases
may
be
issued.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
the
filings
came
just
before
this.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
filings
came
in
1954
and
early
1955.
and
that's
before
this
regulation.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it's
not
quoted
in
our
brief.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
actually,
i
think
we
quoted
a
part
of
the
1952.
before
they
do,
it
was
the
first
and
1952
was
the
current
one
and
i
think
we
quote
that
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
i
guess
that's
not
in
the
briefs.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
102
of
the
record
is
a
partial
--
but
we
have
another
quote
in
our
brief
too.
i'm
not
quite
sure
where
it
is.
page
25
we
cited,
it
seems
there.
yes,
but
a
partial
quote
is
on
page
25
note
29.
there's
in
the
1952
supple
--
the
later
one
with
some
insignificant
differences.
now,
what
we
say
about
the
1955
regulation
makes
perfectly
clear
that
the
secretary
assumes
--
assume
then
that
the
range
is
open
for
leasing.
otherwise,
what
the
respondents
argue
is
that
the
listing
of
the
specified
areas
in
the
appendix
was
designed
specifically
to
authorize
their
leasing
as
an
exception
to
the
general
bar
against
leasing.
the
result
of
that
is
to
say
that
the
1955
regulation
authorized
leasing
only
in
the
areas
where
it
might
seriously
destroy
or
impair
wildlife
conservation
purposes
which
i
suggest
is
either
nonsense.
i'd
necessarily
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
sorry?
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
don't
get
too
much
comfort
from
that
one.
let's
see.
whether
that's
--
alright
that's
by
geological
and
geophysical
prospect
increments,
it's
not
leases
as
such.
and
b
is
about
leases
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
right,
right
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
in
1947
i
think
we
flex
the
general
rule
of
construction
that
wildlife
refuges
are
open
to
leasing
and
this
is
some
specific
prohibition
against
leasing
but
it
doesn't
mention
kenai
range
and
i
cannot
prove
from
that
they
met
kenai
range.
so
to
that
extent
i
don't
find
very
much
comfort
in
the
1947
regulation.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes
that's
right.
all
these
regulations
are
general
throughout
the
united
states.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
right,
right.
but
they
didn't
specifically
refer
to
kenai
range
as
the
1955
regulation
did.
so
i
think
the
1955
regulation
is
very
explicit
in
treating
the
range
as
a
whole
as
open
to
leasing.
now,
respondent's
final
argument
on
that
is
to
say
well
if
it
does
it
opens
them
henceforth
and
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
status
and
the
year
previous
to
that
when
the
applications
were
filed.
now,
i
suggest
a
number
of
reasons
why
that
is
not
a
permissible
reading.
it
certainly
had
that
the
secretary
intended
this
as
a
modification
of
the
executive
order
and
not
an
interpretation
of
it.
he
would
first
of
all
have
used
the
public
land
order
which
is
what
the
delegation
said
they
should
use
for
that
purpose.
and
secondly,
he
would
have
done
it
by
indirections,
see,
i
got
then
that
the
inference
by
the
exception
and
if
he
thought
he
was
changing
the
status
he
wouldn't
do
it
by
indirection.
and
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
this
is
based
on
his
construction
of
the
executive
order
as
not
barring
mineral
leasing.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
oh,
i
would
think
by
--
with
--
that
this
1955
regulation
as
the
plain
interpretation
of
the
executive
order,
arguably
at
least
would
ratify
the
action
of
the
land
office
in
accepting
the
leases
or
the
applications
for
filing
but
we've
not
made
that
argument
and
i
don't
want
to
make
it
here.
now,
when
these
new
regulations
were
issued,
one
they
didn't
promised,
it
didn't
satisfy
anybody.
it's
still
permitted
too
much
leak
and
immediately
congress
started
to
conduct
hearings
on
the
statute
restricting
leasing
even
further
and
it
was
then
that
they
entered
the
agreement
that
they
didn't
report
a
bill
but
they
agreed
that
the
secretary
wouldn't
issue
anymore
leasing
--
leases
in
the
meantime
without
first
consulting
the
committee
and
it's
that
time
that
they
leased
the
swanson
river
unit
with
the
prior
approval
of
the
committee.
so
they
took
the
regulations
under
study
again
and
finally
in
1958,
they
came
out
with
a
brand
new
version
of
the
regulations,
and
that
begins
at
page
6a
of
our
brief.
now,
this
regulation
is
an
almost
complete
victory
for
the
coservationist
forces.
what
it
does,
it
treats
with
wildlife
refuge
lands
exclusive
of
alaska.
and
all
wildlife
refuge
lands
other
than
in
alaska
it
absolutely
bars
and
prohibits
leasing.
that
appears
in
paragraph
b
which
says
that
no
offers
for
oil
and
gas
leases
covering
wildlife
refuge
lands
which
are
defined
over
in
paragraph
a1
exclusive
of
alaska.
but
it
covers
the
rest
of
united
states.
no
offers
will
be
accepted
and
no
leases
covering
such
lands
will
be
issued,
period.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
on
page
7a
of
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
sorry?
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
i
--
i
deny
that.
they
thought
that
then
--
i
--
they've
been
fighting
the
battle
in
the
regulations.
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
there's
no
evidence,
there's
nothing
--
no
action
was
taken.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
there
are
a
lot
of
areas
that
are
open
to
mineral
leasing
that
aren't
--
no
one
applies
on
it.
they
don't
apply
--
a
lease
cost
money.
you
then
get
to
put
down
50
cents
an
acre.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
don't
like
(inaudible),
no
one
filed
prior
to
october
of
1954.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
that's
correct
for
the
purpose
of
this
case.
there
were
six
other
pending
leases,
there
were
five,
some
of
them
--
they
were
mistakes.
we
don't
rely
on
that
i
just
did
not
get
into
them.
but
october
--
i
think
it
was
october
15th,
1954
is
when
richfield
filed
and
that's
what
set
off
the
land
rush
is
richfield's
filing.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
this
is
the
only
--
i'm
advised
this
is
the
only
commercial
oil
and
gas
development
in
all
of
alaska.
since
all
there
is
in
alaska.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
now
the
1958
regulation
as
i
say
close
and
forbad
leasing
entirely
in
all
wildlife
refuges
in
the
united
states
between
alaska
wildlife
refuges
as
a
separate
category.
as
to
them,
it
provided,
and
this
is
paragraph
b3.
as
to
game
ranges,
that
is
another
category
which
i
won't
mention.
as
to
alaska
wildlife
areas,
the
bureau
of
land
management
and
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
are
told
to
enter
an
agreement
specifying
those
lands
which
shall
not
be
subject
to
oil
and
gas
leasing.
and
that
agreement
should
come
effective
upon
approval
by
the
secretary.
and
paragraph
four
in
the
next
page,
the
second
sentence
goes
on,
it
said
the
remaining
lands
in
the
alaska
wildlife
areas
of
this
section
--
the
remaining
lands
in
paragraph
a3
which
i
just
read
of
this
section
is
not
close
to
oil
and
gas
leasing
will
be
subject
to
leasing
on
such
conditions
and
stipulation
as
are
stated
in
the
agreement.
now,
paragraph
c
on
the
same
page
at
page
8a
says
that
the
agreements
are
to
be
published
in
the
federal
register
and
shall
contain
a
description
of
the
land
affected
thereby
which
are
not
subject
to
oil
and
gas
leasing.
and
at
the
bottom
of
that
paragraph
that
lease
offers
for
such
land
but
did
not
close
by
this
order
will
not
be
accepted
until
after
this
new
order
is
published.
and
it
goes
on
to
say
in
section
b
that
all
pending
offers
or
applications
filed
on
alaska
wildlife
refuges
will
continue
to
be
suspended
until
this
agreement
is
announced.
now,
the
agreement
that
was
to
be
raised
between
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
was
reached
and
announced
in
august
2nd,
1958
and
that
appears
on
page
9a
of
our
brief.
and
it
starts
out
by
saying
a
notice
is
given
that
an
agreement
has
been
reached
designating
those
lands
was
in
the
kenai
national
moose
range
which
are
hereby
closed
to
oil
and
gas
leasing.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
everything
has
been
suspended
since
1953.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
we
haven't
started
acting
on
these
applications
yet
except
with
the
special
exception
of
the
swanson
river
unit.
and
it
goes
to
describe
the
land
which
aren't
open
and
said
the
balance
of
land
shall
be
subject
to
filing
and
then
says
on
page
10a
near
the
top
offers
the
lease
covering
any
of
these
lands
which
have
been
pending.
these
are
specifically
out
with
the
kenai
range
which
has
been
pending
and
upon
which
action
was
suspended
will
now
be
acted
upon
and
adjudicated
in
accordance
with
the
regulations.
so
we
say
that
clearly
recognize
all
these
pending
applications
and
directs
that
they
now
be
acted
upon
final
act.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes
it
was.
i
think
that's
now
agreed.
the
suspension
was
just
a
memorandum
from
the
director
of
the
bureau
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
to
his
regional
administrator.
this
is
hold
up
and
actually
there
was
another
memorandum
which
specifically
said
of
course
this
doesn't
affect
continued
filings
or
the
priority,
just
don't
issue
the
leases
until
we
decide
what
we're
going
to
do.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no
i
would
--
i
think
the
respondents
had
one
time
made
that
argument,
they
don't
make
it
here.
i
think
it's
now
specially
agreed
that
this
was
just
internal
--
it
was
never
published
any
place.
when
one
gets
it
out
from
some
internal
memorandum
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
now,
let
me
say
that
the
respondents
have
an
explanation
for
that.
they
say
what
that
means
is
that
these
two
areas
over
here,
area
three
and
area
two,
where
area
three,
no
order
ever
withdrawn
at
it
all,
they
could
have
filed
it
any
time,
it
was
unaffected.
though
as
a
part
f
the
refuge
action
would
have
been
suspended.
but
you
could
apply
at
anytime
and
they
said
well
also
area
two
withdrawn
in
1948,
that
withdrawal
order
was
revoked
in
1955.
after
1955,
this
area
they
say,
well,
admittedly
after
1955
this
is
--
and
they
say
this
reference
is
way
to
these
pending
applications
in
those
two
areas
and
not
to
all
the
applications
in
this
area.
now,
i
will
refer
the
court
to
the
press
release
issued
--
i
think
i'm
going
to
say
so
that
it
obviously
is
not
limited
to
that,
so
i'm
referring
with
press
release
at
page
--
quoted
at
page
23
of
our
brief
in
the
footnote.
on
july
25,
1958,
this
is
just
before
this
order
was
announced,
the
secretary
issued
a
press
release
announcing
the
order.
and
what
he
said
in
the
press
release
was
that
most
of
these
lands
that
are
available
under
this
new
order
are
now
covered
by
applications
that
will
be
adjudicated.
he
acknowledged
it
on
the
issue
as
in
fact
all
of
the
lands
have
already
been
filed
on
and
the
fact
that
you
can
now
find
new
offers
shouldn't
be
taking
the
promise
very
much
because
the
whole
area
was
already
filed
on
and
i
think
it's
perfectly
saying
that
throughout
the
regulations
have
treated
and
assumed
that
the
range
was
open
to
leasing.
one
other
point,
well
we
don't
have
an
argument
that
the
congress
in
fact
endorsed
that
interpretation
when
the
1958
act
did
added
to
the
leases
navigable
waters.
i
don't
want
to
go
to
that
now,
it's
in
our
brief
but
i'm
just
taking
note
of
it.
and
then
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
language
in
the
executive
order
to
see
if
it
can
be
read
to
support
the
secretary's
interpretation.
the
full
text
appears
in
the
respondent's
brief,
this
yellow
brief,
we
didn't
print
the
full
text
so
i
used
his,
it's
on
page
--
it
begins
at
page
1a.
and
the
withdrawal
of
provision,
however,
begins
--
the
withdrawal
of
provision
begins
at
the
bottom
of
page
2a
and
carries
over
the
top
of
page
3a.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
i
post
this
with
the
guise
loaded.
the
secretary
has
already
interpreted
it
and
his
interpretation
noted,
it's
been
acted
on,
it's
been
relied
on,
the
congress
as
in
effect
approved
it
and
i
don't
know
what
interest
would
become
vested
in
any
other
meaning
of
the
words.
and
if
there's
any
basis
for
the
secretary's
interpretation
it
seems
to
me
that
a
case
by
one
in
which
that
interpretation
should
be
upheld.
what
we're
looking
for
is
something
to
support
his
interpretation
not
whether
we
can
criticize
it.
but
in
fact
i
don't
need
to
rely
on
that.
i
think
the
only
reading
of
regulations
where
he
read
it
and
the
court
of
appeals
interpretation
is
the
one
that
was
unreasonable.
what
it
says,
that
none
of
the
above
described
lands
except
in
these
two
parts
over
on
the
left
shall
be
subject
to
settlement
location
or
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
sorry,
page
2a
of
their
brief
--
the
paragraph
that
begins
in
the
bottom.
none
of
the
lands
shall
be
subject
to
settlement
locations,
sale
or
entry
or
other
disposition
(except
for
fish
trap
sites)
under
any
of
the
public
land
laws
applicable
to
alaska
or
to
classification
and
lease
under
the
provisions
of
an
act
which
authorizes
for
farming
leases
or
an
act
which
authorizes
grazing.
and
there's
another
proviso
i'll
rely
on
later.
but
right
now,
the
first
says
it
shall
not
be
subject
to
settlement
locations,
sale
or
entry
or
other
disposition.
now,
settlement,
location,
sale
or
entry
or
terms
that
are
in
the
land
law.
a
settlement
is
what
you
do
when
you
are
homestead
and
you
go
on
settle
on
the
land
and
become
entitled
to
a
patent
on
to
the
land.
a
location
is
a
mining
location,
you
go
out
and
stake
out
in
location
and
record
it
and
then
if
you
discover
mineral,
you
become
entitled
to
a
patent
to
the
land
as
well
as
the
minerals.
and
an
entry
is
using
a
variety
of
ways
which
primarily
of
the
initial
act
of
settling
for
example,
if
you
enter
up
on
the
lands
or
open
the
entry
intending
to
settle
and
acquire
title
under
the
homestead
laws,
you'll
have
a
protected
right
to
prefecture
the
right
by
staying
on
and
that's
generally
on
entry.
now,
sale
means
i
think
it
has
no
definition.
now,
all
of
those
four
things
plainly
aren't
involved
complete
alienations
of
the
government's
title.
and
i
don't
know
how
one
can
possibly
say
that
either
the
application
for
a
mineral
lease
or
the
issuance
of
mineral
lease
can
fit
under
anyone
of
those
words.
i
mean
respondents
haven't
yet
said
which
word
they
think
it
sits
under.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
the
problem,
so
if
it
or
i
think
it
must
come
under
four
other
dispositions.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
no
--
no
their
lack
of
–-
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
sure.
fish
trap
sites
is
a
--
no
one
can
explain
why
fish
trap
sites
is
there.
i'd
like
to
tell
the
court
it's
not
in
our
brief.
i
just
discovered
it
that
the
kodiak
bear
reservation
was
issued
four
months
previously
and
it
is
exactly
word
for
word
this
withdrawal
provision
without
the
fish
trap
site
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
okay.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
if
so,
it
means
you
can't
erect
a
hunting
blind
because
what
a
fish
trap
site
is
it's
just
like
a
hunting
blind.
the
secretary
does
not
grant
permits
to
construct
fish
trap
sites.
his
power
is
the
power
to
regulate
fishing
and
if
he
grants
a
permit,
it's
a
permit
to
fish
with
fish
trap
sites.
and
the
right
to
be
on
the
land
for
that
purpose
is
no
different
with
any
hunter
or
fisherman
to
be
on
the
land.
it
doesn't
give
a
permit
to
use
the
land.
now,
the
reasons
it's
there
as
far
as
one
can
guess
and
it
is
purely
a
guess
is
that
as
you
know
from
the
decisions
to
--
in
369
u.s.
or
the
metlakatla
and
kake
indian,
this
is
a
very
sensitive
matter
in
alaska,
fish
trap
sites.
the
indians
have
always
claimed
that
they
were
economically
appended
on
fishing
by
fish
trap
sites.
the
other
people
in
alaska
have
been
filing
it
for
years
and
now
i
guess
they
ultimately
prevail
in
kake.
now,
at
the
time
this
order
was
issued
in
1941,
the
only
way
i
can
explain
that
is
assure
the
indian
that
this
isn't
affecting
your
rights
to
fish.
i
think
its
wholly
unnecessary,
i
don't
simply
add
it.
now,
the
fact
that
the
same
language,
word
per
word,
the
rest
of
the
provision
appears
in
the
kodiak
withdrawal
four
months
earlier
and
what
i
said,
now,
this
is
copied,
it's
a
carbon
copy
of
that
withdrawal.
let
me
give
a
citation
because
it
isn't
cited
in
our
brief.
the
kodiak
withdrawal
is
--
it's
the
executive
order
8857,
it's
august
19th,
1941,
6
federal
register
4287.
and
what
happened
apparently
is
they
took
that
language
and
someone
was
concerned
about
the
indian's
fish
traps
and
they
just
took
it
in
except
for
fish
trap
site.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
were
there
in
fact
any
significant
dispute
about
the
accuracy
of
the
data
i
would
think
a
way
would
need
to
be
found
to
resolve
the
dispute.
i
suggest
there
is
no
dispute.
there
is
not
been
a
suggestion
made
specifically
that
anything
we
have
said
about
leases
being
issued
is
an
error.
we
have
included
in
our
reply
brief
an
affidavit
of
the
manager
of
the
anchorage
land
office
listing
every
one
at
the
leases
issued
in
the
range
for
their
record
citation
to
the
plat
books
and
the
serial
books
containing
the
data.
none
of
that
has
been
challenged
by
the
respondents.
the
respondents
in
fact
have
examined
the
books.
mr.
tallman
as
the
court
is
aware
having
admitting
him
this
morning
is
himself
a
lawyer
and
lived
in
anchorage
and
he
is
very
familiar
with
the
plat
books
and
the
track
books
and
no
challenge
has
been
made
to
any
specific
data
stated
in
this
affidavit.
now,
what
the
reference
to
about
these
agreements,
was
that
we
have
said
that
prior
to
1955
there
were
six
leases
issued
in
the
range
and
they
were
issued.
our
statement
is
accurate.
however,
when
the
respondents
in
their
briefs
suggested
that
those
early
leases
may
have
been
issued
by
mistake
we
inquired
about
them
and
we
did
get
a
letter
back
from
the
manager
of
the
anchorage
land
office
saying
that
indeed
they
did
seem
to
have
been
issued
by
mistake
and
we
therefore
disavow
them.
let
me
say
we've
never
made
a
heck
of
a
line
of
those
six
leases
and
we
don't
today
and
i
don't
think
you'll
find
any
place
in
our
brief
that
we
have.
the
really
significant
pre-1958
leasing
was
the
swanson
river
unit
up
in
the
top
and
that's
the
only
one
i
rely
on
and
it's
suggested
that
--
it's
improper
for
us
to
call
that
to
the
court's
attention.
i
would
like
to
read
what
the
respondent
told
the
court
of
appeals
about
the
matter
which
we
quote
at
page
27
of
our
brief.
this
is
what
the
respondent
told
the
court
of
appeals
in
their
brief,
i'm
quoting,
“no
leases
issued
for
any
lands
within
the
kenai
range
between
1941
and
1958.”
none
at
all.
further,
that
the
discovery
of
oil,
the
acknowledge
that
oil
was
discovered
in
‘57
that
the
discovery
of
oil
in
the
kenai
peninsula
in
july
1957
were
in
areas
of
the
peninsula
outside
of
the
kenai
national
moose
range.
they
told
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
oil
discovery
was
outside
the
range
and
i
think
it's
now
conceded
the
oil
discovery
is
right
here
right
in
the
middle
of
the
range.
now,
it's
possible
they
didn't
know
that.
i
find
it
really
hard
to
believe
they
didn't
know
it,
and
neither
that
they
now
know
it.
let
me
say
what
--
i'd
like
now
to
say
also
goes
to
their
point
that
the
other
leases
are
not
in
jeopardy
that
this
case
involves
only
this
handful
of
leases.
the
court
of
appeals
decide
to
this
case
on
september
19,
a
thursday
of
1963
the
following
week,
the
following
monday,
the
respondent
--
the
respondents
started
filing,
top
filing
all
the
areas
that
have
been
leased
in
the
range.
the
yellow
area,
these
yellow
areas
primarily
covering
the
oil
field,
were
filed
on
that
following
week
by
the
respondents.
now,
a
lot
of
other
people
filed
too
and
this
doesn't
show
all
the
duplicating
filings,
marathon
and
union
file
in
that
area
also.
the
yellow
and
green
areas
are
areas
filed
on
by
other
persons
which
respondent
tallman
had
an
interest
but
the
main
field
was
filed
on
by
the
respondents.
now,
that
suggests
that
by
their
actions
they
think
this
case
because
is
in
predicate
on
which
they
challenged
the
other
leases
and
i
also
suggest,
it
shows
that
at
least
one
week
after
the
decision
they
knew
where
the
oil
field
was
even
if
they
didn't
know
when
they
filed
the
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
in
terms
of
reference
no
matter
outside
the
record
i
think
our
presenting
to
the
court
an
affidavit
of
the
manager
of
the
anchorage
land
office
which
shows
each
lease
and
where
it's
located
and
the
records
will
show
it
i
think
it's
satisfactory
to
establish
the
general
administration
of
the
range
and
it
has
not
been
challenged,
no
one
has
questioned
the
accuracy
of
that
data.
all
they
have
said
is,
“well,
we
don't
know.”
if
they
don't
know
it's
because
they
don't
want
to
know.
unless
they
specifically
challenged
and
i
don't
mean
take
out
one
lease,
you
don't
care
about
one
lease
covering
a
few
acres
but
they
challenged
specifically
something
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
then
i
think
some
other
device
would
have
to
be
found.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
of
the
right?
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
let
me
see
how
it
arose
but
first
i
think,
before
the
1947
regulation
on
wildlife
refuges,
the
practice
was
generally
not
to
lease,
not
to
grant
leases.
they
were
--
the
leasing
act
applied
to
them
but
on
each
individual
application
be
rejected
on
recommendation
to
wildlife
service.
it
wasn't
really
an
issue
when
you
drew
an
order
whether
or
not
he
was
barred
mineral
leasing.
that
it
never
is
because
the
main
function
of
withdrawal
order,
the
reason
you
have
to
have
them
is
to
prevent
private
autonomous
adverse
action.
lot
of
public
lands
in
the
past
have
been
able
to
inquire
rights
simply
like
going
on
and
didn't
take
require
anybody
to
say
so.
he
just
went
on
and
picks
out
a
location
and
to
prevent
that
from
happening,
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
withdrawal
order
prevent
autonomous
acquisition
of
rights.
now,
mineral
leasing
since
it
always
requires
an
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
secretary
anyway,
there's
no
particular
need
in
the
withdrawal
order
to
forbid
it
and
the
secretary
can
then
decide
by
regulation
or
by
individual
determinations
to
what
extent
he
was
just
to
permit
leasing
and
at
the
time
of
this
order
in
‘41,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
particular
focus
on
it.
i
don't
--
i
hope
i
haven't
implied
that
i
think
that
order
specifically
focused
on
the
question
of
respondent
to
it.
i
think
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
it
is
a
perfectly
reasonable
and
probably
that
the
preferable
one.
let
me
say
as
early
as
1921,
this
is
cited
in
our
brief,
the
solicitor
construed
language
withdrawing
lands,
location,
entry
or
other
disposal
for
water
power
purposes
as
not
preventing
leasing
under
the
1920
mineral
leasing
act
that
disposal
did
not
include
leasing.
the
leading
textbook
in
1951
said
that
on
this
matter
and
i
don't
think
it
should
not
have
been
a
surprise
to
anyone
learned
in
the
field
that
this
order
did
not
prevent
mineral
leasing.
as
to
the
language
of
the
order,
the
significant
language
is
other
disposition,
now
granted
a
mineral
lease
is
a
disposal
a
disposition
of
the
mineral
deposits
of
the
minerals
but
the
order
doesn't
say
that
none
of
the
minerals
shall
be
subject
to
disposition,
it
says
none
of
the
lands
shall
be
subject
to
disposition.
and
the
question
is
whether
it's
a
disposition
of
land,
now
the
only
right
that
a
lease
gives
you
to
the
use
of
the
land
is
to
such
use
as
necessary
to
expiration
and
extracts
and
that
from
the
--
that
is
not
even
an
exclusive
right.
anybody
else
can
continue
to
use
the
land
for
other
authorized
purposes.
and
secondly,
the
order
doesn't
stop
with
that
language,
it
goes
on
also
specifically
to
withdraw
the
lands
from
classification
or
lease
under
the
two-sided
fur
farming
statutes
and
if
they're
right
about
this
position
that
was
wholly
unnecessary.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
in
all
orders,
mr.
justice?
that's
an
over
hard
question
to
answer
but
this
last
order
that
they
mentioned
today
it's
not
in
their
brief
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
an
answer
to.
it
was
a
1935
order
which
set
for
other
appropriation
and
they
later
added
amended
that
was
specific
orders
to
permit
coal
leasing
under
the
alaska
coal
leasing
statute
which
on
the
face
raises
the
same
question
and
i
don't
have
answer
to
that
at
lease
i
haven't
been
able
to
get
when
this
far
and
there
are
thousands
of
these
orders
and
to
really
to
expect
total
consistency
is
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
said
that
is
right
that
--
and
that's
what
the
public's
opinion
of
the
solicitor
i
think
are
all
entirely
consistent
on
that
and
certainly
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
in
the
administration
of
this
range
that
has
been
consistent
and
the
1955
regulation
is
the
first
formal
regulatory
statement
that
leave
no
doubt
about
how
the
secretary
viewed
the
1941
executive
order
and
this
within
file
at
‘55
this
is
three
years
later
before
they
filed
and
the
people
who
filed
prior
to
‘55
were
in
effect
told
by
the
‘55
regulation
that
the
lands
were
now
and
always
had
been
opened
for
leasing
and
they
didn't
--
they
were
in
fact
so
they
didn't
have
to
file
again
and
they
have
been
sitting
there
for
four
years.
and
it's
not
that
after
oil
is
discovered
that
the
new
group
comes
in
and
top
files
and
i
think
at
least
the
administration
and
the
regulations
and
the
orders
about
this
range
have
all
been
entirely
consistent
all
the
way
through
and
it
was
interim
to
dispute
about
that.
thank
you.
