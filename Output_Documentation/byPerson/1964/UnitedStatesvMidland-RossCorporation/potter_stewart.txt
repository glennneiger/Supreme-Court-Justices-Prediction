now
in
the
example
you
just
gave,
the
bank,
what
--
what’s
the
rule
if
the
bank
is
not
on
the
accrual
basis?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
--
any
year
of
the
material
note
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice

stewart
that
reason
is
clear
i
suppose
but
nonetheless
as
you
say
it,
it’s
like
a
person
--
the
real
estate
dealer,
he
doesn’t
get
the
ordinary
event
because
it’s
a
capital
gains
available
of
a
case
and
also
as
a
real
estate.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
really
think
that
these
differentiations
are
explainable
just
in
terms
of
the
inability
to
get
beyond
the
forced
rate
of
interest
because
this
is
certainly,
it
doesn’t
take
much
sophistication?
i
don’t
know
but
(voice

--

rate
of

justice

of
somebody
in
the
second
grade,
it
makes
some
sense?
justice

stewart
unwillingness
to
impose
this
so
much
burden
of
computation
on
something
at
this
--
probably
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
matters
in
many
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
can
i
ask
you
just
a
question
now?
what
business
was
this
respondent
in?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
that's
right,
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
it
wasn't
in
the
business
of
buying
and
selling.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
whole
transaction
were
within
one
taxable
year,
there
wouldn’t
be
any
practical
difference
from
the
government's
point,
if
the
government
is
right,
would
there
be?
