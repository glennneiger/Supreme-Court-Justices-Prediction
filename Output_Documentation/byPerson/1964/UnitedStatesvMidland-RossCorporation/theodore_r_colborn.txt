mr.
theodore
r.
colborn
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
goodman
has
very
reasonably
stated
the
facts
of
the
midland-ross
case
quite
fully.
in
response
to
the
last
question
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
excelled
taxpayer
here
was
industrial
rayon
corporation
which
subsequently
was
merged
into
midland-ross.
it
had
accumulated
very
large
funds
for
the
purpose
of
building
a
new
synthetic
plant
if
it
could
figure
out
how
to
design
something
better
than
dupont.
and
during
the
period
of
1952,
1953
and
1954,
they
was
investing
these
dollar
funds
in
whatever
fairly
liquid
and
assured
investments
would
yield
at
the
largest
return
for
its
stockholders.
and
the
notes
in
question,
whereas
mr.
goodman
said,
mostly
$1
million
and
$2
million
notes
issued
by
general
motors
acceptance
corporation
and
cit
for
specific
numbers
of
days
which
were
picked
out
as
a
matter
of
negotiation
between
the
treasurer
of
industrial
rayon
and
the
treasurer
of
these
borrowing
companies
to
best
suit
their
convenience
as
to
just
when
the
money
should
first
go
from
industrial
to
gmac
and
then
come
back.
the
maturities
were
67
days,
209
days,
267
days
up
to
a
maximum
of
325
days.
and
the
price
for
the
notes
was
negotiated
having
in
mind
what
the
going
interest
rate
would
be
eligible.
the
money
had
been
loaned
on
a
interest
rate
instead
of
being
used
to
purchase
these
discount
notes,
but
then
was
negotiated
into
an
exact
dollar
and
cents
price
which
industrial
paid
to
gmac
or
cit
for
the
million-dollar
note.
judge
kalbfleisch
in
the
district
court
wrote
a
very
long
and
very
careful
opinion
in
this
case
including
that
despite
the
fact
that
this
type
of
profit
is
similar
to
interest,
it
was
not
what
congress
intended
to
be
treated
as
interest,
but
rather
was
what
congress
intended
to
be
treated
as
capital
gain.
in
fact,
it
was
stipulated
in
the
record
in
the
case
that
the
taxpayer
here
had
sold
capital
assets
resulting
in
a
gain
and
this
is
quite
exactly
what
section
117
and
section
111
of
the
1939
internal
revenue
code
which
applies
said
should
be
capital
gain.
the
government
as
we’re
now
hearing
as
taking
the
view
now
that
although
the
treatment
of
this
type
of
discount
prior
to
1954
has
not
been
clear
in
the
rulings,
it
should
now
be
considered
that
this
discount
was
interest
as
mr.
goodman
just
said
for
the
first
time
in
all
of
his
proceeding
very
clearly,
that
industrial
rayon
corporation
should
have
accrued
the
discount
on
these
notes
on
a
daily
basis.
this
has
never
been
suggested
in
the
earlier
consideration
in
these
matters.
the
proposition
was
that
when
the
bonds
were
sold
that
that
gain,
was
not
entitled
to
capital
gains
treatment,
but
if
the
interest
is
being
accrued
as
you
go
along
if
there
had
been
interest
on
it,
there
wouldn’t
be
any
gain
because
if
the
view
is
that
that
this
discount
must
be
accrued
as
income
day-by-day
and
month-by-month
since
it
isn’t
received
in
cash,
it
must
be
added
to
the
basis
of
the
property
although
there’s
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
you
can
add
it
to
the
basis
of
property
and
if
you
do
add
it
to
the
basis
of
the
property,
by
the
time
industrial
rayon
sold
these
notes,
its
cost
to
which
would
be
added
this
theoretical
interest
which
had
never
got
but
equal
to
what
it
gotten
and
would
have
had
no
gain.
mr.
theodore
r.
colborn
in
most
cases,
mr.
justice
stewart
not,
but
in
certain
unusual
situations,
the
difference
whether
something
comes
in
as
interest
income
on
an
accrual
basis
or
instead
comes
in
from
the
gain
of
sale
of
a
property
which
is
not
a
capital
asset
does
make
a
difference
and
to
me,
it’s
extremely
important
in
revealing
that
when
congress
did
legislate
about
this,
that
it
had
–
as
we
all
know
many,
many
opportunities
to
legislate
prior
to
1954
and
when
it
did,
it
did
not
say
that
this
discount
should
be
treated
as
interest.
it
did
not
say
that
the
discount
should
be
accrued.
it
said
exactly
the
contrary.
it
said
that
when
there
is
a
gain
from
the
sale
of
a
discount
obligation,
a
part
of
that
gain
equal
to
this
calculated
original
issue
discount
shall
be
treated
as
gain
from
the
sale
of
property
which
is
not
a
capital
asset,
which
bears
very
little
similarity
in
its
reasoning,
no
similarity
on
its
reasoning
to
what
the
government
is
now
arguing.
actually,
mr.
goodman
has
very
fairly
in
general
recognized
that
there
were
rulings
in
many
different
fields
here.
he
has
failed
to
mention
that
the
most
direct
rulings,
which
though
not
published
were
widely
known
by
businessmen
and
tax
practitioners,
the
private
rulings
such
as
the
two
that
are
cited
at
the
very
end
of
our
brief
which
did
deal
with
bankers'
acceptances
and
bills
of
almost
exactly
the
nature
that
are
here
and
in
which
the
internal
revenue
service
made
it
very
clear
in
1952
that
they
did
not
consider
that
the
discount
was
the
same
as
interest
and
in
fact,
recognized
that
upon
the
sale
of
such
bills,
there
would
be
gain
which
would
be
created,
presumably
as
capital
gain.
now
--
mr.
theodore
r.
colborn
certainly
in
the
proper
treatment
of
it,
i
can
see
no
reason
for
distinguishing
the
--
this
court
in
the
--
mr.
theodore
r.
colborn
1952,
sir.
mr.
theodore
r.
colborn
forgive
me
mr.
justice
white.
i
don’t
consider
that
the
fact
that
the
taxpayer
has
expressly
given
the
right
to
write
off
by
way
of
amortization
of
the
premium
in
any
normal
sense,
it
would
cause
it
to
be
referred
to
as
an
income
item.
it
remains
a
capital
item.
the
normal
--
the
most
usual
capital
item
perhaps
is
when
a
businessman
pays
a
million
dollars
for
a
manufacturing
plant
and
then
he
is
permitted
to
write
that
off
by
way
of
depreciation
over
the
life
of
the
plant
and
this
is
to
me
exactly
the
theory
in
which
in
1942,
congress
for
the
first
time
said
that
this
premium
paid
by
an
investor
for
a
bond,
which
had
previously
been
considered
for
all
purposes
as
the
capital
item
could
be
written
off
over
its
life
not
converting
it
into
an
income
item
but
permitting
it
to
have
a
proper
effect
upon
its
overall
income.
mr.
theodore
r.
colborn
well,
the
buyer
of
the
bond
or
the
lender
of
money
who
takes
a
note
and
receives
a
premium
is
making
an
investment,
which
he
--
has
denied
by
this
court
in
the
earlier
years,
the
right
to
apply
in
reduction
of
its
interest
income,
congress
came
along
and
said
that
you
should
be
if
the
proper
election
is
made,
permitted
to
write
it
off
over
its
life.
if
he
doesn’t
write
it
off
over
its
life,
or
if
we
were
talking
about
a
period
before
congress
did
act
in
1942,
when
he
sold
it,
it
would
have
a
capital
loss.
mr.
theodore
r.
colborn
this
is
substantially
right
in
1952
and
--
mr.
theodore
r.
colborn
well,
there
is
a
difference
for
example
in
the
case
of
a
non-registered
bond
without
coupons
as
to
which
for
a
brief
period
there
was
no
amortization
of
the
premium
allowed.
that
has
since
been
changed,
so
that
in
most
circumstances
at
the
present
time,
there
has
developed
a
general
consistency
of
treatment.
i
think
it
maybe
worthwhile
only
very
briefly
to
refer
to
the
situation
in
1929
when
in
the
sense
this
matter
of
discount
came
--
first
came
firstly
to
congress’
attention
and
i
think
congress
made
very
clear
that
they
did
intend
discount
of
this
sort
to
be
treated
as
a
capital
item.
the
treasury
department
in
the
spring
of
1929
indicated
very
strongly
to
congress
that
it
wanted
the
authority
to
issue
discount
bills
of
this
sort
very
much
like
we
are
here
talking
about
in
this
case
except
they
were
to
be
issued
by
the
united
states
government
instead
of
by
general
motors
acceptance
corporation.
they
--
ogden
mills,
the
undersecretary
of
the
treasury
emphasized
that
from
a
financial
market
standpoint,
this
would
be
a
different
sort
of
thing
which
would
permit
the
government
to
handle
its
financing
in
some
ways
more
efficiently
and
therefore,
better
than
to
the
ordinary
interest-bearing
certificates.
and,
the
treasury
department
proposed
that
as
a
statutory
matter,
since
the
statute
already
provided
that
interest
on
interest-bearing
certificate
should
be
exempt
from
tax,
it
should
put
in
further
language
that
the
gain
from
the
sale
or
other
disposition
of
the
discount
obligations
should
also
be
exempt
from
tax.
and
advise
the
senate
finance
committee,
as
senator
cousins
and
other
senators
said
in
the
debate
that
this
is
because
the
--
when
the
gain
was
realized,
this
would
be
treated
as
gain
under
the
existing
practice
gained
from
the
sale
and
that
some
special
language
needed
to
cover
the
--
our
brief
said,
i’m
afraid
much
--
too
much
of
trying
to
analyze
the
details
that
debate
--
our
appendix
to
our
brief
has
20
pages
of
it
and
all
i
think
worth
adding
is
that
i
think
any
careful
reading
either
of
the
statements
specifically
by
senator
smoot
and
senator
cousins
and
senator
reid
separately,
or
a
continuous
reading
of
all
of
it
inevitably
indicates
that
the
senators
did
consider
that
although
the
effect
of
this
discount
was
very
much
the
same
as
interest,
it
would
not
be
treated
the
same
under
established
tax
practices
and
the
general
provisions
of
the
revenue
acts.
so,
they
put
in
the
explicit
provision
that
discount
on
this
treasury
bills
shall
be
considered
interest,
which
as
mr.
goodman
said
is
a
foundation
for
the
many
government
rulings,
internal
revenue
service
rulings
as
the
treatment
--
as
a
treatment
of
treasury
bills.
perhaps
even
more
dramatically
demonstrating
what
--
that
congress
recognized
that
under
the
general
provisions,
discount
on
corporate
notes
would
be
capitaliting
--
it
is
their
special
provision
for
treating
such
discount
differently
in
certain
special
cases.
each
of
the
briefs
discusses
of
the
treatment
that
congress
provided
under
the
1939
code
for
insurance
companies
and
this
special
treatment
explicitly
said
that
in
the
case
of
certain
specified
types
of
insurance
companies,
premium
on
bonds
and
discount
should
both
be
amortized
by
the
insurance
company
and
the
treasury
department’s
regulations
under
these
sections
expressly
recognized
that
this
was
a
different
treatment
from
taxpayers
generally.
now
this
meant
--
this
provision
was
continued
into
the
1954
code
and
this
meant
that
as
to
these
particular
taxpayers,
these
insurance
companies,
section
1232,
which
treated
generally
whether
original
issue
discount
had
no
application
because
as
i
have
indicated
before,
if
you
are
accruing
the
discount
as
you
go
along,
you
never
get
to
section
1232.
just
last
year,
congress
indicated
again
the
same
understanding
of
these
principles
when
it
decided
that
as
to
certain
of
the
insurance
companies,
they
should
change
the
treatment
and
make
--
and
have
their
handling
of
discount
bonds
the
same
as
corporations
generally.
so,
they
said
expressly.
in
revised
code
section
820
(d),
that
this
provision
requiring
the
amortization
into
income
of
the
discount
should
not
apply
to
bonds
issued
after
1962
and
said
in
the
committee
report,
“this
provision
has
the
effect
of
postponing
until
disposition
of
the
bond,
any
recognition
of
income
attributable
to
bond
discount”,
at
which
time,
the
provisions
of
section
of
1232
maybe
applicable.
thus,
congress
is
recognizing
that
where
section
1232
is
applicable,
the
idea
of
accruing
the
discount
as
though
where
interest
is
not
appropriate.
the
same
treatment
was
clearly
recognized
as
to
congress’
point
of
view
or
thought
it
--
of
what
it
thought
it
had
provided
when
in
1938,
the
sub-committee
in
its
brief
report
that's
set
forth
at
page
11
of
our
appendix,
indicated
that
the
capital
gains
tax
generally
should
not
be
removed
because
among
other
difficulties,
this
would
permit
some
sort
of
avoidance
by
taxpayers
who
would,
instead
of
taking
interest-bearing
obligations,
on
which
they
would
pay
an
ordinary
tax,
would
take
discount
obligations
on
which
they
would
pay
no
tax
because
the
discount
was
a
gain
item
and
the
sub-committee
said,
“we
shouldn’t
do
that.”
now,
the
sub-committee
clearly
thought
that
there
was
an
advantage
in
leaving
the
capital
gain
tax
on
the
discount
obligations
to
avoid
an
incentive
to
taxpayers,
to
avoid
tax
by
converting
their
debt
into
that
type
of
instrument,
but
they
indicated
very
clearly
that
they
were
not
concerned
that
taxpayers
might
perhaps
setup
their
obligations,
their
loans
in
that
fashion
in
order
to
get
a
capital
gain
treatment
instead
of
an
ordinary
income
treatment.
congress
recognized
in
1938
that
there
would
be
the
capital
gain
treatment
from
this
and
we’re
not
concerned
about
it.
when
--
in
1954,
they
did
become
concerned
let
us
say,
that
this
type
of
income
which
was
similar
to
interest
was
being
taxed
as
capital
gain
instead
of
ordinary
income,
they
went
to
great
length
and
details
in
section
1232
in
providing
just
under
what
circumstances
the
discount
should
be
treated
otherwise
in
this
capital
gain.
this
was
limited
as
has
been
noted
to
situations
where
the
issuer
was
a
corporation
or
a
governmental
body
rather
than
an
individual.
my
--
our
only
guess
really
as
to
the
reason
for
that
is
the
historical
one
that
way
back
before
the
income
tax
was
adopted
there
had
been
an
issue
tax
on
certain
types
of
corporate
obligations
and
that
some
of
these
statutes
in
1942,
the
provision
for
permitting
amortizing
of
bond
premium
and
then
again
in
1954,
they
have
followed
the
pattern
of
that
--
of
the
type
of
obligations
that
were
originally
subject
to
that
tax
and
they
broadened
it
somewhat,
but
have
not
extended
it
to
individuals
and
i
suppose
where
the
general
feeling
that
there
are
relatively
few
such
individual
obligations.
it's
further
limited
to
such
obligations
held
only
six
months,
it’s
specifically
recognizes
the
situation
that
was
discussed
earlier
that
the
discount
may
not
be
big
enough
to
bother
with
and
congress
certainly
has
the
right
to
say
that
despite
the
logic
of
it,
we’ll
give
one
treatment
if
the
discount
is
only
a
quarter
of
a
percent
per
year
and
another
if
it’s
more
than
that.
but
i
do
not
believe
that
in
construing
the
1939
code,
where
there
was
not
any
statutory
provision,
it
would
be
sensible
for
the
internal
revenue
service
to
say,
we’ll
treat
a
big
discount
as
ordinary
income
and
required
to
be
accrued
but
we
won’t
require
our
little
discount
to
be
accrued
because
it
isn’t
worth
bothering
with,
that
sort
of
decision
is
congress’.
we
pointed
out
the
method
that
congress
adopted
was
entirely
different
from
the
government’s
present
proposal.
mr.
justice
stewart
specifically
asked
about
a
case
where
there
was
a
change
in
the
discount
rate
so
that
someone
having
a
--
let
us
say,
a
$103
note
that
they’d
paid
a
hundred
dollars
for,
just
before
it
was
ready
to
accrue
could
only
sell
it
for,
say
a
$102
and
mr.
goodman
answered
that
in
that
situation,
there
would
be
ordinary
income
of
$2.97
and
a
capital
loss.
now,
section
1232
doesn’t
say
that,
it
says
very
clearly
that
to
the
extent
there
was
a
gains
to
what
--
$2,
that
much
gain
will
be
taxable
if
it
is
not
more
than
the
computed
original
issue
discount.
so
the
computed
original
issue
discount
might
be
$2.95,
but
the
gain
is
only
$2,
only
that
is
taxable
and
there
is
no
capital
loss
in
such
a
situation.
when
congress
got
around
to
taking
care
of
what
can
well
be
considered
a
logical
problem,
they
studied
it
and
they
did
it
in
detail
and
they
did
it
by
methods
which
it’s
not
practical
for
the
internal
revenue
service
to
try
and
work
out
for
transactions
that
took
place
many
years
ago.
now,
a
number
of
questions
both
yesterday
and
today
have
been
directed
at
whether
we
were
talking
about
discount
or
yield,
they
--
this
court
in
the
earlier
cases
has
talked
about
the
effective
rate
of
interest
or
the
effective
rate
of
return
which
was
as
this
court
said
in
accounting
term,
which
had
the
same
significance
as
yield.
but
each
time
it
has
come
up,
this
court
has
held
that
that
is
not
what
the
tax
law
is
following,
that
in
construing
the
tax
law,
it
must
follow
the
usual
meaning
of
the
words
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
old
colony
railroad
case
which
discussed
bond
premium.
mr.
goodman
has
referred
to
the
old
colony
case
in
which
this
court
held
that
premium
that
was
paid
does
not
affect
the
real
interest
to
be
taken
into
account
for
tax
purposes
although
it
does
affect
the
yield
or
the
effective
rate
of
return,
mr.
goodman
considered
that
a
criticized
case.
actually
it’s
been
cited
a
number
of
times
including
many
citations
by
the
government
in
some
of
the
litigation.
this
matter,
it’s
been
criticized
by
economist
let
us
say,
who
say
that
it
may
not
be
making
theoretical
economic
sense
to
talk
about
an
interest
rate
without
also
carrying
in
mind
the
arithmetic
of
the
premium
of
the
discount
and
accountants
who
have
to
certify
the
financial
statements
for
accounting
purposes
wanted,
adjusted
and
treated
differently.
but,
this
is
not
at
all
to
say
that
this
court
was
wrong
that
in
saying
when
congress
used
the
words
interest,
that
congress
talked
about
what
the
cost
of
a
bond
that
had
been
purchased
that
the
premium
was,
congress
was
using
those
words
in
their
ordinary
sense
and
not
in
the
theoretical
accounting
sense.
it
was
after
this
court
had
held
that
premium
should
not
be
adjusted
for
as
though
it
were
part
of
the
interest
that
congress
for
the
first
time
in
1942
provided
by
amending
the
1939
code
as
we
have
said,
that
if
the
investor
and
corporate
bond
as
that
he
purchased
at
a
premium,
wish
to,
he
could
write
that
off
affecting
his
net
income
although
not
directly
affecting
his
interest
income
and
when
they
did
it,
they
did
it
by
very
express
language
and
led
a
number
of
conditions
put
on.
but
it
was
not
until
1954
that
congress
determined
to
apply
that
same
principle
or
a
similar
principle
to
discount
by
enacting
as
it
did
in
section
1232.
now,
the
bond
premium
amortization
sections
have
come
before
this
court
twice
since
congress
put
them
in,
and
in
each
case
as
i
read
them,
the
rail
case
in
339
u.s.
and
the
hanover
bank
case
in
369
u.s.,
they’re
cited
in
all
of
our
briefs,
this
court
simply
tried
to
find
out
what
congress
meant
when
it
referred
to
bond
premium
when
it
referred
to
the
premium
at
which
the
taxpayer
had
purchased
a
bond
rather
than
at
an
economic
analysis
to
find
out
what
an
economist
would
say,
the
effective
rate
of
interest
was.
in
the
carell
case,
it
was
very
clear
that
the
premium
which
the
taxpayer
was
allowed
to
amortize
under
this
section
had
almost
nothing
to
do
with
interest.
it
was
largely
attributable
that
the
right
to
convert
the
bond
in
the
common
stock
of
american
telephone
and
telegraph
company
and
this
court
said
that
since
congress
said
a
premium
paid
for
a
bond
can
be
written
off,
then
it
could
be
written
off
and
it
wasn’t
up
to
the
internal
revenue
service
to
say
that,
“well,
this
didn’t
effect
to
rate
of
interest
and
therefore
it
shouldn’t
be
written
off.”
similarly
in
the
hanover
bank
case,
congress
had
said
that
the
premium
that
was
paid
could
be
written
off
over
the
period
from
the
time
the
bond
was
purchased
until
the
earliest
date
at
which
it
might
be
called
and
this
resulted
on
the
peculiar
facts
of
that
case
because
they
were
utility
bonds
that
were
callable
but
nobody
expected
them
to
be
called.
if
you
wrote
the
premium
off
over
the
period
in
which
theoretically
they
might
be
called,
if
you
ended
up
with
i
think
a
negative
interest.
you
ended
up
with
a
investor
taking
in
certain
interest
in
the
income,
but
taking
a
ride
off
which
is
considerably
more
than
that.
certainly
not
reflecting
the
real
yield
or
the
effective
rate
of
interest,
but
this
court
said
that
this
is
what
congress
provided
and
it
should
be
a
vow.
actually,
what
mr.
chief
justice
warren
said
in
that
hanover
bank
case
in
the
very
conclusion,
i
think
is
very
appropriate
to
this
case
as
to
what
the
decision
of
this
court
should
be
when
the
government
is
now
urging
that
in
construing
the
old
1939
code,
we
now
apply
these
economic
theories
rather
than
what
congress
said
should
be
done.
the
court
said
in
that
case,
“nevertheless,
the
government
urges
this
court
to
do
what
the
legislative
branch
of
the
government
failed
to
do
or
elected
not
to
do.”
this
of
course
is
not
within
our
province.
i
thank
your
honors.
