mr.
frank
i.
goodman
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
essentially
the
same
issue
as
the
last
case.
the
respondent
here
is
an
industrial
corporation
which
in
1952,
1953,
and
1954
advanced
large
sums
of
money
to
financial
institutions
such
as
the
commercial
credit
company
and
cit
in
exchange
for
notes
of
those
institutions.
the
notes,
13
in
number
were
all
payable
in
less
than
a
year.
while
they
did
not
in
terms
provide
for
the
payment
of
interest,
all
were
issued
at
a
discount,
usually,
between
2.0%
and
2.5%,
on
an
annual
basis,
the
notes
were
typically
in
face
amounts
of
$1
million
or
$2
million.
in
each
instance,
the
respondents
sold
the
note
to
a
bank
a
few
days
prior
to
its
maturity,
realizing
a
total
gain
of
about
$280,000,
all
of
which
was
attributable
to
the
discount
at
which
they
were
originally
issued.
taxpayer
reported
this
gain
on
its
tax
returns
as
capital
gain.
commission
had
determined
however,
that
the
excess
of
the
face
amount
of
the
notes
over
the
amount
at
which
they
were
issued
represented
interest,
and
since
the
notes
were
also
within
the
taxable
year,
he
treated
the
entire
gain
realized
on
the
sale
of
the
notes
as
ordinary
income.
now,
i
should
note
parenthetically
here
that
midland-ross,
like
dixon
and
the
lot
like
the
dixon,
petitioners
in
the
last
case,
were
on
the
accrual
basis
and
therefore,
logically,
they
should
have
been
required
to
accrue
the
interest
as
it
was
earned
prior
to
the
sales,
but
since
--
and
irrespective
of
whether
the
notes
were
sold
or
not.
but
since
in
this
case,
the
notes
were
all
in
fact
sold
within
the
tax
year,
the
result
is
exactly
the
same
whether
you
treat
them
as
having
accrued
the
interest
as
it
was
earned
or
simply
as
having
realized
the
interest
upon
the
sale
of
the
notes.
the
respondent
paid
the
resulting
deficiencies
and
brought
suit
for
refund.
the
district
court
held
that
the
gain
was
all
capital
gain
and
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed
per
curiam,
citing
its
earlier
decision
on
the
caulkins
case.
here
as
in
dixon,
the
taxpayer
does
not
seriously
dispute
the
fact
that
discount
and
stated
interested
are
in
substance
identical.
the
taxpayer
argues
though
that
congress
intended
that
it
nonetheless
to
be
treated
differently.
the
argument
i
think
goes
something
like
this.
prior
to
1954,
it
was
the
practice
of
the
internal
revenue
service
to
treat
original
issued
discount
differently
from
interest
and
to
treat
it
as
a
capital
item
upon
the
sale
of
the
notes.
that
this
practice
was
confirmed
by
a
1927
decision
of
the
board
of
tax
appeal,
and
was
impliedly
ratified
by
congress
through
its
failure
to
enact
a
general
statute
authorizing
equality
of
treatment
or
the
same
treatment
for
interest
and
discount
and
we
think
that
this
presents
a
holy
misleading
picture
of
the
pre-1954
law.
but
before
getting
to
that,
i’d
like
to
point
out
preliminarily,
within
view
of
the
admittedly
irrational
results
for
which
the
respondent
contends,
it
would
require
nothing
less
than
the
clearest
statutory
or
judicial
authority
to
justify
that
result.
prior
to
1954,
apart
from
the
caulkins
case
which
i’ve
already
discussed,
there
was
no
decision
by
this
court,
by
any
court
of
appeals
or
even
by
any
federal
district
court
which
even
dealt
with
the
treatment
of
original
issue
discount
on
the
lender’s
side
and
as
i’ve
suggested,
all
of
the
cases
on
the
borrower’s
side
treated
it
as
interest,
most
of
them.
there
are
to
be
sure
a
number
of
administrative
rulings
and
decisions
for
the
board
of
tax
appeal
on
the
treatment
of
discount
on
the
lender’s
side,
but
these
are
aligned
on
both
sides
of
the
question,
some
of
them
treating
discount
as
interest,
others
treating
it
differently.
the
fact
to
the
matter
is,
that
prior
to
1954
when
congress
provided
a
solution
for
the
matter,
there
simply
was
no
general
rule,
no
general
administrative
practice
as
to
the
treatment
of
original
issue
discount.
at
most,
there
were
a
number
of
special
rules
and
special
practices
dealing
with
particular
types
of
taxpayers,
particular
types
of
securities
and
particular
aspects
of
the
tax
treatment.
one
commentator
writing
in
1940
in
the
north
carolina
law
review,
summarized
the
situation
as
it
existed
then
in
the
following
terms.
“present
federal
practices
involve
on
the
surface
at
least
a
welter
of
theoretical
inconsistencies.
both
administrators
and
judges
have
contributed
to
the
state
of
affairs
and
neither
the
administrators
nor
the
board
of
tax
appeals,
nor
the
federal
courts
have
ever
undertaken
a
complete
analysis
of
all
these
inconsistent
practices
in
an
attempt
to
show
if
or
how
they
can
be
justified
in
relation
to
each
other.”
so
i
don’t
think
it
accurate
to
say
that
it
was
the
commissioner’s
position
prior
to
1954
that
original
issue
discount
was
a
capital
item
to
be
differentiated
from
interest.
now,
a
detailed
analysis
of
this
rather
complicated
history
doesn’t
lend
itself
very
well
to
oral
argument
and
we
discuss
it
i
think
fully
in
our
brief.
i
would
like
to
summarize
those,
some
of
the
principle
strands
on
the
tapestry.
first
of
all
as
i’ve
indicated,
the
cases
almost
from
the
beginning
held
that
original
issue
discount
was
deductible
as
interest
by
the
borrower,
the
issuer.
secondly,
in
the
case
of
tax
exempt
state
and
municipal
securities,
it
was
recognized
again
almost
from
the
very
beginning
that
discount
at
which
these
exempt
securities
were
issued
would
tantamount
to
interest
and
therefore,
it
too
was
made
tax
exempt.
this
was
not
the
result
of
statute
i
might
underscore
as
it
sometimes
suggested,
there
was
no
federal
statute
dealing
with
the
treatment
of
original
issue
discount
on
state
and
municipal
securities.
the
same
solution
was
adopted
by
statute,
however,
with
respect
to
federal
treasury
notes
as
early
as
1929,
the
statute
providing
that
the
discount
at
which
these
non-interest
bearing
notes
were
issued
should
be
considered
as
interest.
even
after
that
statutory
exemption
was
removed,
moreover,
the
administrator
continued
to
apply
the
principle
that
discounts
was
the
same
as
interest
with
respect
to
these
securities,
because
they
issued
a
ruling
requiring
that
this
discount
now
be
treated
as
taxable
interest
and
amortized
as
such
by
the
lending.
thirdly,
the
rule
with
respect
to
bond
discount
was
that
discount
was
equivalent
to
interest
and
was
to
be
treated
as
such.
that
is,
when
a
bond
--
when
a
bank
–
excuse
me,
i
said
bond
discount,
i
meant
bank
discount.
when
a
bank
lends
money
by
purchasing
the
short-term
of
non-interest
bearing
note
of
a
borrower,
say
he
purchases
for
a
$100,
a
$106
note
from
the
borrower,
that
$6
increment
has
always
been
treated
by
the
commissioner
as
equivalent
of
interest
and
the
bank
has
been
required
to
accrue
it
as
an
interest
if
it
was
on
the
accrual
basis.
now
i
think
this
is
significant
because
the
kind
of
short-term
non-interest
bearing
notes
which
was
the
subject
of
the
rulings
on
bank
discount
are
very,
very
similar
in
character
to
the
short-term
non-interest
bearing
notes
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
if
the
bank
is
not
on
the
accrual
basis
then,
as
any
other
cash
basis
taxpayers,
it’s
not
required
to
account
for
the
interest
as
it
is
earned
over
the
life
of
the
security,
but
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
only
on
the
year
of
sale.
now
in
the
case
of
a
bank,
the
increment
will
of
course
would
be
treated
as
ordinary
income
because
the
bank
is
in
business
buying
and
selling
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
--
these
items.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
there
would
be
no
question
about
that
in
any
event,
but
that
wasn’t
the
reason
for
the
rulings.
it’s
quite
clear
if
you
read
it,
the
1925
ruling
which
is
referred
to
and
i
think
quoted
in
our
brief,
is
simply
that
is
an
economic
matter,
interest
and
discount
would
be
the
same
(voice
overlap)
--
nothing
is
said
about
the
bank’s
paying
in
business.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that’s
right,
but
the
ruling
didn’t
pertain
to
the
treatment
of
the
sale
of
a
notes,
whether
it
would
be
capital
gain
or
ordinary
income.
it
pertains
to
whether
or
not
it
has
to
be
amortized.
and
on
that
question
the
court
said,
this
is
the
interest
and
like
interest,
it
should
be
accrued.
now
there
is
authority
that
the
commissioner
took
a
different
view,
there
is
some
evidence
that
the
commissioner
took
a
different
view
as
to
bond
discount.
a
1920
ruling
cited
by
midland-ross
and
also
a
1927
decision
of
the
board
of
tax
appeal
held
that
bond
discount
was
not
required
to
be
accrued
by
the
lender
even
though
it
was
accruable
by
the
issuer.
it’s
not
entirely
clear
from
those
holdings
whether
the
commissioner
or
whether
the
board
of
tax
appeals
had
in
mind
original
issue
discount
or
only
market
discount,
which
of
course
would
be
the
most
prevalent
form
of
discount
on
corporate
bonds.
it’s
also
i
would
note,
neither
of
these
authorities
says
anything
about
question
of
capital
gain
or
ordinary
income
upon
the
sale
or
redemption
of
the
bond.
so,
that
there
was
a
differentiation
in
treatment
apparently
between
the
discount
on
corporate
bonds
and
the
discount
on
short-term
non-interest-bearing
notes.
i
don’t
think
it’s
fair
to
say
that
the
rule
with
respect
to
corporate
bonds
was
the
general
rule,
while
all
of
the
other
strands
of
treatment
that
i’ve
discussed
represented
some
sort
of
out
of
the
way
exceptions.
there
simply
was
no
general
rule
and
if
anything,
the
type
of
securities
involved
in
the
present
case
are
much
closer
to
the
short-term
notes
involving
the
bank
holding
and
the
bank
rulings
than
they
are
to
corporate
bonds.
there
is
i
think
an
explanation
for
the
differentiation
of
treatment
between
bonds
and
other
forms
of
securities,
or
at
least
between
interest-bearing
and
short
--
and
the
non-interest-bearing
securities.
corporate
bonds
are
typically
interest-bearing
in
character,
the
discount
or
premium
element
usually
is
very,
very
small.
it’s
not
intended
as
a
substitute
for
the
whole
of
the
interest
as
it
was
in
this
case.
usually,
it
represents
a
last-minute
adjustment
to
conditions
on
the
market
place
on
the
date
of
issue.
a
second
feature
of
bonds
is
the
fact
that
they
are
relevantly
long-term
in
character
or
long-term
and
therefore,
change
hands
frequently
on
the
marketplace
before
their
redemption.
now,
a
number
of
implications
flow
from
these
distinctions
between
bonds
and
short-term
non-interest-bearing
securities
such
as,
have
been
held
to
give
rise
to
interest,
the
discount
element
has
been
held
equal
to
interest.
in
the
first
place,
since
the
discount
is
very
small
usually
in
the
case
of
corporate
bond,
it
may
have
been
thought
that
it
just
wasn’t
worth
bothering
about,
it
wasn’t
worth
requiring
the
burdens
and
computations
in
order
to
account
for
it
as
interest.
it
may
also
have
been
thought,
that
because
the
banks
--
because
the
bonds
change
hands
frequently
during
their
life,
it
was
unduly
burdensome
to
require
each
successive
holder
to
ascertain
what
the
original
discounts
have
been
and
to
account
for
it.
these
problems
didn’t
arise
in
the
case
of
short-term
notes
which
bore
no
interest.
also,
i
think
it
quite
probable
that
the
equivalence,
the
economic
equivalence
of
interest
and
discount
was
much
more
obvious
in
the
case
of
non-interest-bearing
notes
than
it
was
in
the
case
of
interest-bearing
bonds
which
did
carry
a
stated
rate
of
interest
and
where
you
had
to
say
that
wasn’t
the
real
interest.
what
they
said
was
the
interest,
wasn’t
the
real
interest
because
of
the
discounted
premium
element.
i
think
that
this
goes
far
towards
explaining
also
the
differentiation
of
treatment
between
premium
and
discount.
premium
is
invariably
associated
with
interest-bearing
securities
and
the
fact
that
the
court
has
been
reluctant
to
say
that
the
nominal
interest
rate
wasn’t
the
real
interest
rate,
doesn’t
necessarily
mean
that
it
would
have
been
--
but
it
would
have
said
where
you
had
a
completely
non-interest-bearing
security,
this
security
has
no
interest
at
all.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
i
agree
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
i’m
afraid
i
can’t
thing
of
any
rational
explanation
to
the
differentiation
treatment,
and
this
is
a
pragmatic
explanation
which
i
think
makes
some
sense
in
terms
of
a
practical
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
the
inability
to
recognize
bond
discount
for
what
it
was
namely
an
additional
interest
paid
to
the
lender
does
reflect
i
think
considerable
degree
of
naive
test,
but
giving
way
to
the
pragmatic
considerations
to
which
i
referred,
the
difficulty
of
making
the
computation
from
the
case
where
a
discount
was
small
in
relation
to
the
stated
interest
and
the
difficulty
of
requiring
subsequent
holders
of
the
bonds
to
make
these
computations,
i
think
might
well
have
the
--
it
might
justify
(voice
overlap)
the
differentiation,
it
might
well
have
explained.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
right.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well
i
think
that
is
the
most
satisfactory
explanation,
but
what
i
do
suggest
is
that
no
one
could
ever
have
thought
that
corporate
bonds
issued
without
interest,
4%
or
5%
corporate
bonds
issued
without
stated
interest
but
at
a
discount
could
yield
the
lender
a
capital
gain
treatment
because
if
that
were
true,
no
other
kind
of
bonds
would
ever
have
been
issued.
a
bond
with
a
stated
rate
of
interest
which
gave
rise
to
ordinary
income
upon
its
sale
or
redemption,
simply
couldn’t
have
competed
in
the
marketplace
with
funds
issued
at
a
discount
which
conferred
this
tax
bonanza
upon
the
lender.
if
i
might,
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
in
our
case?
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
it
was
an
industrial
corporation,
i
frankly
--
i
forgotten
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no,
it
was
not
and
as
far
as
the
record
shows
this
is
the
only
time
that
has
happened.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
yes.
we
make
no
differentiation
based
upon
accrual
basis
or
cash
basis
or
anything
like
that.
