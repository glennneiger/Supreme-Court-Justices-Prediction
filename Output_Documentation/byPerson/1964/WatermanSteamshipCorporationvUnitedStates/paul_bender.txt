mr.
paul
bender
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
course
of
my
argument,
i'm
inescapably
going
to
have
to
refer
the
figures.
all
of
them
i
think
are
set
out
on
the
chart
on
page
7
of
the
government's
brief
except
for
the
depreciation
figure
which
mr.
justice
white
mentioned
in
his
question
earlier.
i
think
it
will
be
easier
to
follow
the
argument
if
you
have
those
figures
before
you.
i'll
try
to
make
them
as
simple
as
possible
and
round
them
out.
i
may
have
to
give
some
other
examples
involving
different
figures
in
an
attempt
to
make
it
simple.
i
shall
do
my
best.
well,
let
me
start
this
way
in
the
few
minutes
remaining,
i
would
like
to
try
to
demonstrate
to
you
why
the
petitioner's
argument
as
he
stated
today
is
absolutely
untenable
and
i
would
like
to
do
so
this
way.
referring
again
to
the
chart
on
page
7,
petitioner
argues
and
he
said
it
several
times
in
the
brief
and
he
says
it
in
his
argument
that
the
statute
should
be
read
as
having
no
tax
effect.
any
mention
of
taxes
in
the
statute
just
for
the
purposes
of
computing
the
adjustment,
but
it
has
no
tax
effects
and
he
says
that
no
taxes
were
returned
to
him
as
a
consequence
of
the
statute.
well,
we
think
that's
wrong
and
i
shall
try
to
demonstrate
in
the
bulk
of
my
argument
tomorrow,
why
the
statute
does
have
tax
effects
and
why
the
fact
that
the
statute
has
tax
effects
leads
you
to
the
government's
results?
well,
i
should
like
to
take
the
case
first
on
the
assumption
that
he's
right
and
that
the
statute
has
no
tax
effects.
listen
to
what
his
argument
is.
he
said
he
paid
and
he
did
pay
about
$47
million
with
each
ships,
that's
on
line
1
on
page
7.
he
got
back
in
one
way
or
another,
either
by
cash
credit
or
reduction
of
his
mortgage
about
$20
million,
$20,400,000,
that's
the
net
payment
on
line
10
on
the
brief.
he
paid
$47
million.
he
says
he
got
back
$20
million,
he
says
his
economic
investment,
then
his
$26
million,
that's
the
last
line
of
the
sheet
that
he
gives
you
here,
remember
your
graph
sheet.
let's
assume
that's
true.
his
economic
investment
would
be
$26
million,
but
he
also
concedes
that
he
has
already
taken
depreciation
on
these
ships
of
about
$11
million.
he's
deducted
$11
million
from
his
income
for
income
tax
purposes
in
calculating
his
taxable
income,
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
we
say
he
is
allowed
for
future
depreciation
of
about
$17
million,
which
if
you
add
it
to
the
$11
million
would
mean
that
he'd
get
a
total
depreciation
of
$26
million,
which
he
says
is
just
as
economic
investments.
$11
plus
oh,
excuse
me
about
28,
right,
which
would
be
more.
we
are
not
being
that
general
because
i'm
simply
--
i'm
trying
to
follow
it
on
his
argument.
i'm
trying
to
demonstrate
why
his
is
wrong.
we
don't
agree
with
--
mr.
paul
bender
in
the
future,
about
$17
million.
mr.
paul
bender
because
the
$11
million
has
been
disallowed
mr.
justice
brennan
and
his
taxes
for
all
those
years
have
been
recomputed,
so
that
$11
million
dollars
was
not
allowable,
that's
in
section
--
mr.
paul
bender
well,
he
once
got
it,
but
it
was
all
taken
away
from
him.
it
can
actually
--
mr.
paul
bender
exactly,
but
he
said
that
that
never
happens.
so,
what
i'm
trying
to
demonstrate
is
why
his
is
absolutely
wrong
and
why
his
gives
him
a
terribly
unjustifiable
tax
benefit.
coming
back
to
what
i
said,
he
says
his
economic
investment
is
$26
million,
but
he
says
his
basis
now
is
$26
million,
which
would
mean
that
in
the
future
he
can
depreciate
$26
million.
and
he
also
admits
that
he's
a
ready
depreciated
$11
million
and
he
says
that
depreciation
has
never
been
taken
away.
that
would
mean
that
in
the
future
he
gets
$26
million
depreciation,
he
has
already
had
$11
million
depreciation,
he
gets
$37
million
--
$37
million
depreciation
on
a
total
economic
investment
by
his
own
admission
of
$26
million,
now
that
can't
be.
mr.
paul
bender
in
the
future?
mr.
paul
bender
aggregate
depreciation.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
he's
only
entitled
to
aggregate
depreciation
after
you
recompute
his
past
taxes,
that's
about
$17
million.
the
price
he
would
have
paid
had
he
bought
the
ship
under
the
act,
right.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
the
way
he
has
--
the
fallacy
of
what
he
does
is
that
he
has
made
all
his
computations
on
the
basis
that
his
basis
was
at
the
time
of
the
act
$47
million,
the
amount
that
he
paid
for
the
ships.
that
isn't
true
because
at
that
time
he
has
taken
$11
million
in
depreciation
and
his
adjustment
basis
was
not
$47
million,
it
was
$47
million
minus
depreciation
he
took.
now
the
statute
as
we
point
out
in
the
brief
and
as
i
shall
try
to
explain
more
fully
tomorrow,
the
statute
in
the
course
of
the
adjustments
makes
it
quite
explicit
that
he
must
sign
an
agreement
agreeing
to
certain
tax
effects,
this
is
in
9(c)(1)
of
the
statute,
one
of
these
tax
effects
is
the
dis-allowance
of
all
past
depreciation
reductions.
now
when
we
disallow
those
deductions
and
recompute
his
taxes,
as
though
they
hadn't
been
allowable,
that
escalates
his
basis
back
up
to
the
amount
it
was
before
he
took
it,
that's
why
you
start
[inaudible]
then
we
say
you
take
from
the
basis
the
amount
of
the
purchase
price
differential
which
is
line
3
on
page
7,
$29
million
and
you
come
out
with
--
and
they
come
out
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
this
now,
you
come
out
with
under
our
submission,
the
basis
which
the
taxpayer
would
have
had,
had
he
purchased
the
ship
under
the
act.
now,
there's
a
very
simple
way
to
decide
this
despite
concentrating
on
that
point.
the
act
quite
clearly
says
in
the
beginning
of
section
9,
which
is
the
only
section
which
is
intimately
involved
with
this
case,
that
the
adjustment
--
this
is
on
page
11
of
our
brief,
the
adjustment
shall
be
made
as
here
and
after
provided
by
treating
the
vessel
as
if
it
were
being
sold
to
the
applicant
on
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
this
act
and
not
before
that
time.
now
if
you
apply
that
alone,
you
would
come
out
with
a
government's
answer.
if
you
treat
this
vessel
and
if
it
would
be
sold
to
the
applicant
on
the
date
of
the
enactment
to
the
act
and
not
before,
this
basis
would
be
the
basis
he
would
have
in
the
vessel
if
he
bought
the
vessel
on
the
date
of
enactment
and
the
enactment
not
before,
and
that
basis
would
have
to
be
the
statutory
sales
rate
minus
certain
minor
adjustments.
for
example,
for
the
trading
of
ships
which
aren't
important.
mr.
paul
bender
approximately
sir.
mr.
paul
bender
right,
that's
the
only
depreciation
he
gets
mr.
justice
brennan,
because
the
past
depreciation
has
been
wiped
out.
mr.
paul
bender
4
and
9
of
where?
mr.
paul
bender
what
do
you
refer
to?
the
depreciation
is
washed
out
by
the
application
of
section
9(c)(1),
9(c)(1)
is
on
14
and
it
says
in
so
many
words,
depreciation
and
amortization
allowed
or
allowable
up
to
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
this
act
for
federal
tax
purposes
shall
be
treated
as
not
having
been
allowable,
that
takes
care
of
that
and
in
return
for
that,
his
taxes
are
recomputed
and
so
he
hasn't
taken
it.
mr.
paul
bender
oh,
it's
hidden.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
it's
hidden
in
a,
refund
of
taxes
on
return
sure
to
hire
[inaudible]
less
taxes--
mr.
paul
bender
well,
you
see
if
you're
going
to
the
unwinding
operation
mr.
justice
white,
is
to
have
him
return
to
the
united
states
the
$13
million
in
charter
hire
and
that's
line
4.
mr.
paul
bender
alright.
now
in
connection
with
the
return
of
that,
we
can't
--
and
we
recompute
his
taxes
for
those
years
as
though
that
amount
wasn't
an
income,
that
comes
9
(b)
(a).
well,
we
couldn't
just
do
that
in
enacting
the
statute
because
then
he
might
have
a
loss
for
that.
he
would
have
taken
this
enormous
depreciation.
we're
going
to
take
a
large
item
out
of
income,
he
would
have
a
loss
which
you
could
carry
over
to
other
years?
mr.
paul
bender
well,
the
refund
is
the
end
result
of
the
re-computation.
perhaps
the
language
in
that
line
could
be
more
explicit.
what
i
mean
by
it
now
and
what
i
would
like
you
to
treat
it
as
meaning
is
the
refund
after
the
re-computation.
mr.
paul
bender
line
one
is
just
the
original
purchase.
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
paul
bender
right
and
we
take
the
basis
back.
mr.
paul
bender
wherever
you
like.
mr.
paul
bender
coming
back
to
the
argument,
i
was
making
on
the
basis
of
the
injunction
in
the
act
to
treat
the
taxpayer
as
though
he
had
bought
the
vessel
after
the
enactment
of
the
act,
if
you
take
that
literally
and
if
you
apply
it
and
if
you
apply
to
tax
purposes,
obviously
the
basis
you
would
have
is
the
basis
you
would
have
had
if
he
bought
the
ship
under
the
act
and
the
basis
would
be
essentially
the
statutory
sales
price.
now
that's
very
important,
because
if
his
basis
is
higher
than
that
in
the
years
after
the
statute
and
he
has
a
competitive
advantage
over
people
who
bought
the
ships
under
the
act.
they
would
have
bought
a
ship
at
the
statutory
price
and
they
would
only
get
depreciation
based
on
the
statutory
price.
petitioner
argues
that
he
bought
the
ship
beforehand
would
be
in
the
same
kind
of
ship
would
be
entitled
to
depreciation
on
a
much
higher
basis,
in
this
case
about
$9
million
higher.
that
would
mean
that
if
he
earned
a
certain
amount
of
gross
income
each
year,
he
would
have
a
lower
amount
of
taxable
income
because
he
takes
the
larger
depreciation
and
that
would
mean
comparing
him
with
his
competitors
on
the
same
amount
of
gross
income,
he
would
have
larger
after
tax
then
which
would
be
an
unfair
competitive
advantage
and
it's
quite
clear
that
the
general
purpose
of
the
statute
is
inconsistent
with
that.
the
legislative
history
which
we
cite
and
which
petitioner
relies
on,
it
says
over
and
over
again
that
the
purpose
is
to
put
him
in
the
same
boat
as
other
people
who
bought
these
ships.
now
under
the
petitioner's
argument,
you
can't
do
that.
well,
what
i
would
like
to
argue
in
a
constructive
fashion
rather
than
the
destructive
fashion
tomorrow
is
that
petitioner
--
the
reason
why
the
basis
in
this
case
is
different
from
the
original
purchase
price
of
$47
million
minus
the
net
return
$20
million,
is
that
it
isn't
like
the
case
mr.
justice
goldberg
gave
during
petitioner's
argument.
if
you
bought
something
for
$100
and
got
$20
back
ordinarily
your
basis
would
be
$80,
but
in
that
situation
no
tax
effects
are
connected
with
the
return
of
the
$20.
what
i
should
like
to
demonstrate
to
you
tomorrow
is
that
there's
an
entirely
different
result
if
tax
effect,
income
tax
effects
are
connected
with
the
return
of
the
$20.
it's
possible
if
all
that
$20
for
example
was
taken
into
income
by
the
buyer
that
it
wouldn't
have
any
effect
on
this
basis.
on
the
other
hand,
certain
income
tax
deductions
are
associated
whether
you
would
have
a
different
effect.
therefore,
our
argument
our
constructive
argument
rests
on
the
premise
if
there
are
taxes
effects
connected
with
the
statute
and
that
by
applying
the
tax
effects,
you
come
out
with
the
statutory
sales
price.
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
i
start
with
that
tomorrow
fresh
from
our
show,
if
i
may,
i
will
stop
now.
mr.
paul
bender
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
i
tried
to
show
how
petitioner’s
argument
in
this
case
was
wrong
in
two
respects,
first
of
all,
by
giving
to
applicant’s
readjustment
under
the
1946
statute,
a
higher
basis
for
income
tax
purposes,
then
a
purchaser
would
have
had
under
the
statute.
petitioner's
argument
ignores
a
direction
of
the
statute
to
treat
the
vessel
and
the
purchaser
and
the
applicant
for
adjustment
as
if
the
vessel
were
being
sold
to
the
applicant
on
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
this
act.
second
of
all,
i
tried
to
show
that
petitioner's
argument
by
giving
it
greater
depreciation,
then
its
economic
investment
on
its
own
theory
of
economic
investment
would
give
it
obviously
too
much
depreciation
and
an
unfair
competitive
advantage.
i
said
that
today
i
would
try
to
show
how
my
close
application
of
the
provisions
of
the
1946
act,
you
could
and
should
reach
the
result
for
which
the
government
contends,
name
it
that
the
basis
to
an
applicant
for
adjustment
under
the
1946
act
is
the
basis
the
applicant
would
have
had
as
a
purchaser
under
the
act.
for
that
purpose,
again,
i
shall
have
to
refer
to
figures
and
again
i
shall
try
to
restrict
them
to
the
figures
on
page
7
in
the
brief.
let
me
first
go,
recapitulate
somewhat
what
mr.
mcconnell
did
yesterday
in
giving
some
of
the
background
of
the
statute.
as
mr.
mcconnell
said,
the
18
vessels
connected
with
this
case
were
bought
by
the
taxpayer
between
1942
and
1946
for
prices
which
were
quite
high
reflecting
war
time
cost
of
the
vessels.
the
prices
paid
appear
on
line
one
of
the
schedule
on
page
7,
and
that
is
about
$47
million.
the
purchase
price
was
paid
for
these
ships
in
cash
and
also
in
mortgages
and
also
in
trade-ins
of
other
ships.
i
don't
think
there's
any
need
for
us
to
worry
further
in
the
argument
about
the
exact
method
of
payment.
and
i
think
the
taxpayer
agrees
that
it
doesn't
matter
in
this
case
whether
the
payment
was
made
by
cash
or
trade-in
or
mortgage.
mr.
paul
bender
right.
mr.
paul
bender
the
difference
is
the
trade-in
of
ships,
ours
is
exclusive
of
trade-in
that
is
--
mr.
paul
bender
yes.
if
you
add
those
together
you
get
the
same
figure.
now
during
the
war,
these
ships
were
all
charted
back
to
the
government
under
bareboat
charters.
the
amount
of
charter
hire
received
was
about
$13
million,
that
appears
on
line
4
of
this
chart.
also,
as
it
came
out
yesterday,
during
the
war
while
these
boats
were
being
charted
to
the
united
states,
petitioner
took
depreciation
on
the
vessels
in
computing
its
income
taxes
on
this
$13
million
charter.
the
depreciation
was
about
a
$11
million,
so
you
have
up
until
the
time
of
the
petitioner
buying
the
ships
for
$47
million,
chartering
them
back
to
the
government
for
about
$13
million.
taking
that
$13
million
into
income
for
federal
income
tax
purposes,
meanwhile,
depreciating
the
boats
of
federal
income
tax
purposes
by
total
of
about
$11
million.
so
at
the
time
the
act
is
passed
in
march
1946,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
the
basis
of
the
ships
has
been
depreciated
down
from
the
original
cost
about
$47
million
by
the
amount
of
depreciation
taken
about
$11
million.
now
comes
the
1946
act.
again,
as
mr.
mcconnell
described
yesterday,
the
purpose
of
the
act
in
general
was
to
sell
all
these
ships
which
the
government
had
acquired
during
the
war
to
private
parties
at
stable
prices
called
the
statutory
sales
price.
these
prices
were
roughly
in
the
case
of
cargo
vessels
which
are
involved
in
this
case,
about
half
what
those
vessels
had
cost
people
during
the
war.
anyone
could
buy
one,
speaking
in
general.
now,
if
that
is
all
the
act
have
done,
it
would
have
been
a
bit
unfair
to
people
who
had
bought
ships
during
the
war
at
double
the
statutory
prices.
so
the
act
contains
a
section,
section
9,
which
provided
that
persons
who
had
bought
vessels
during
the
war
could
apply
for
an
adjustment.
and
the
problem
here
is
the
effect
of
that
adjustment
which
petitioner
applied
for
and
received
upon
petitioner's
basis
for
income
tax
purposes.
let
me
try
if
i
may
to
summarize
for
you,
the
nature
of
this
section
9
adjustment.
the
provision
to
section
9
seemed
enormously
complicated.
there
are
eight
subsections
and
then
there's
also
subsection
9(b)
and
there
is
also
subsection
c,
but
it's
not
as
complicated
as
it
seems
on
the
face
of
it.
essentially,
there
are
three
parts
to
the
adjustment.
the
overriding
purpose
of
the
whole
thing
is
as
i
said
before,
to
put
the
purchaser
in
the
position
he
would
have
been
at
if
he
bought
the
ships
under
the
act.
therefore,
the
first
part
of
the
adjustment
which
is
contained
in
subsections
9(b)
1
through
4.
those
are
on
the
pages
11a
and
12a
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief
and
to
some
extent
in
9(b)
7,
provides
that
a
credit
shall
be
given
to
the
applicant
for
the
difference
between
the
price
he
paid
during
the
war
and
the
statutory
sales
price,
in
this
case
that
amount
was
$29,287,000,
that's
line
3
on
page
7.
that
gives
him
back
the
difference
between
the
high
price
he
paid
in
the
statutory
sales
price.
but
that
alone,
excuse
me,
i
like
to
emphasize
now
that
this
--
for
that
chambers,
for
that
credit
in
the
statute,
no
income
tax
consequences
are
provided.
it
simply
provides
that
a
credit
shall
be
given
for
the
difference
in
price.
no,
that
payment
to
the
applicant
is
not
a
taxable
payment.
that
alone
however,
would
not
put
the
applicant
in
the
position
he
would
have
been
in
had
he
bought
the
ship
after
the
act
because
he
had
used
the
ship
during
the
war.
he
had
charted
it
to
the
government
and
received
$13
million
in
charter
hire
and
in
fact
he
paid
income
taxes
on
that
amount.
so
the
second
part
of
this
adjustment
is
an
unwinding
of
the
transactions
which
the
applicant
actually
entered
into
with
the
ship
during
the
war.
now
that
part
is
contained
in
subsections
9(b)
6
and
to
some
extent
in
9(b)
8.
what
the
act
provides
is
that
all
the
charter
hire,
which
the
applicant
received
from
the
united
states
during
the
war
should
be
returned
to
the
united
states.
now
in
--
since
the
applicant
had
paid
income
taxes
on
that
amount
in
return
for
that,
those
amounts
are
treated
as
if
they
had
never
been
received
in
income
and
the
applicant's
income
taxes
are
recomputed
as
though
those
amounts
had
never
been
received
in
income
that's
provided
in
9(b)
8
by
applying
the
provisions
of
9(c)
1.
9(c)
1
is
quite
explicit
on
that
amounts
credited
to
the
secretary
under
the
section
9(b)
6,
that
is
for
charter
hire,
shall
be
treated
for
federal
tax
purposes
as
not
having
been
received
but
accrued
as
income.
that
alone
however,
still
wouldn't
have
been
enough
because
the
applicant
was
taking
depreciation
deductions
on
these
ships
and
if
you
just
took
the
amount
out
of
income,
he
would
have
these
enormous
deductions,
$11
million,
but
no
income
to
offset
them.
so
he
either
have
--
it
would
either
be
offset
of
other
income
which
he
had
for
which
he
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
the
deductions
or
he
have
a
loss
which
he
would
carry
over
to
other
years.
so
is
it
part
of
the
total
unwinding,
we
have
to
take
away
those
depreciation
deductions
also
and
that's
provided
in
9(c)
1,
depreciation
amortization
allowed
or
allowable
for
federal
tax
purposes
shall
be
treated
as
not
having
been
allowed.
well
that's
then
the
second
part
of
the
adjustment.
you
give
back
the
charter
hire
and
you
recompute
the
taxes
as
though
the
charter
hire
had
never
been
received
and
as
though
depreciation
deductions
had
not
been
allowable.
now
notice
that
there,
federal
tax
consequences
are
very
clearly
provided
in
the
act
for
the
giving
back
of
charter
hire,
there
is
a
corresponding
lowering
of
federal
income
taxes.
you
take
that
amount
out
of
income
and
you
re-compute
the
taxes
as
though
that
amount
had
never
been
paid
as
income,
even
though
it
had
in
fact
been
paid.
essentially,
it
amounts
to
a
deduction
from
federal
income
taxes
for
the
years
in
which
the
charter
hire
has
been
received.
now,
even
those
two
things
alone
do
not
completely
put
the
applicant
in
the
position
he
would
have
been
in,
had
he
not
bought
the
vessels
until
the
date
of
the
act.
because,
if
he
hadn't
bought
the
vessels,
he
wouldn't
have
traded
in
vessels,
in
this
case
the
applicant
traded
in
4
vessels
and
those
vessels,
he
would
have
charted
to
the
government
by
trading
them
and
he
didn't.
also
in
buying
the
vessels
he
made
quite
a
substantial
economic
investment.
if
he
hadn't
made
that
economic
investment,
he
would
have
invested
the
money
some
place
else
or
put
it
in
the
bank
and
receive
some
income
on
it.
so
the
third
part
of
the
adjustment
which
the
act
provides,
is
to
give
him
the
income
he
would
have
received
during
the
war
if
he
hadn't
purchased
the
ships
until
the
date
of
the
act,
and
that's
provided
in
9(b)
5
and
9(b)
6.
one,
we
give
him
the
charter
hire
which
he
would
have
received
on
the
ships
traded
in.
two,
we
gave
him
interest
at
the
rate
of
3.5%
on
the
economic
investment
he
made
in
the
ships.
again,
corresponding
to
that
payment
to
him
which
would
have
been
ordinary
income
if
it
had
been
paid
during
the
war,
we
impose
federal
income
taxes
on
that.
again,
that's
provided
in
9(c)
1,
amounts
credited
to
the
applicant
under
subsections
(b)
5
and
(b)
6
shall
be
treated
for
federal
tax
purposes
as
having
been
received
and
accrued
as
income
in
the
taxable
year
which
was
on
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
this
act.
so,
these
amounts
are
credited
to
him
and
income
taxes
are
imposed
upon
the
applicant
in
the
year
1946.
those
three
things
together,
you
give
him
back
the
difference
in
purchase
price,
you
impose
no
tax
consequences
on
that.
he
gives
you
back
the
charter
hire,
you
give
them
back
the
income
taxes
you
paid
on
the
receipt
of
the
charter
hire
and
we
give
him
income
he
would
have
received
if
he
hadn't
purchased
the
ships
an
imposed
taxes
on
that
amount
essentially,
not
completely,
not
exactly
but
essentially
put
the
applicant
in
the
position
he
would
have
been
had
he
not
purchased
the
ships
until
the
date
of
the
act.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
he
doesn't
give
back
the
depreciation.
we
take
out
of
his
income
for
the
years
in
which
he
received
charter
hire,
the
charter
hire
he
received.
we
also
disallow
for
those
years
as
deductions,
the
depreciation,
the
sum
--
then
we
re-compute
his
taxes.
the
sum
of
that
re-computation
is
in
line
a,
$430,206
that's
a
--
mr.
paul
bender
the
precise
figures
do
not
appear
in
the
record.
in
the
petitioner's
appendix,
you
can
find
the
depreciation
figures
in
exhibit
g
in
the
interim
agreement
and
they
add
up
to
as
we
say
in
the
brief
over
$11
million,
but
the
precise
tax
calculations
were
not
put
in
the
record.
the
only
thing
that
appears
in
the
record
is
the
sum
of
the
re-computation
of
taxes
for
all
of
these,
not
only
the
giving
back
of
the
charter
hire
but
also
the
substituted
charter
hire
and
that's
--
mr.
paul
bender
yes,
yes,
yes.
mr.
paul
bender
right,
right.
now,
the
essence
of
our
argument
is
that
because
of
the
tax
consequences
provided
for
the
second
and
third
parts
of
the
adjustment
i've
described,
that
is
the
imposition
of
income
tax
on
the
charter
hire
an
interest
credited
to
the
applicant
and
the
forgiveness
of
income
tax
on
the
charter
hire
which
the
applicant
pays
back
to
the
united
states,
because
of
these
tax
consequences,
those
parts
of
the
adjustment
have
no
effect
upon
basis.
essentially,
we
argue
that
an
amount
paid
by
a
buyer
to
a
seller
on
which
he
takes
a
deduction
from
income,
for
federal
tax
purposes
doesn't
affect
his
basis.
on
the
other
hand,
an
amount
paid
by
a
seller
to
a
buyer
which
is
taken
into
income
by
the
applicant
--
by
the
buyer
doesn't
affect
his
basis.
that
means
that
the
only
part
of
this
adjustment
which
affects
basis
is
the
purchase
price
credit,
the
$29
million.
and
that
is
the
amount
of
that
credit
diminishes
basis
from
the
original
price
which
is
$49
--
$47
million
by
the
$29
million
and
you
come
out
--
now
this
figures
on
page
8,
if
you
make
that
subtraction,
you
come
out
with
$17,800,000
which
is
the
basis
the
applicant
would
have
had
if
he
bought
the
ship
under
the
act.
now
i'd
like
to
try
to
demonstrate
to
you
with
some
simple
examples,
not
in
the
context
of
this
rather
complicated
case
why
it
is
true
that
amounts
which
the
buyer
pays
to
the
seller
and
which
the
buyer
deducts
from
income
do
not
affect
his
basis.
and
on
the
other
hand,
amounts
which
the
seller
pays
to
the
buyer
which
the
buyer
includes
an
income
do
not
affect
his
basis
leaving
in
this
case
only
the
amount
of
the
purchase
price
adjustment
which
has
no
income
tax
consequences
under
the
statute.
take
for
an
example,
a
very
simple
case.
i'll
use
figures
of
hundreds
of
dollars
rather
than
millions
of
dollars
but
the
figures
are
inappropriate.
suppose
a
buyer
buys
a
building,
a
business
building
for
a
$100
and
as
part
of
the
buying
agreement,
as
part
of
the
contract,
he
agrees
to
rent
it
back
to
the
seller
for
one
year
for
$10.
now,
the
total
amount
the
buyer
then
--
and
the
agreement
also
provides
that
the
$10
rent
shall
be
payable
in
advance
at
the
time
of
the
agreement.
now
the
total
amount
the
buyer
is
going
to
pay
in
cash
is
$90,
$100
for
the
building
less
$10
rent
coming
back.
however,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
if
the
$10
rental
payment
is
included
in
the
buyer's
income
for
income
tax
purposes,
his
basis
in
the
building
isn't
$90,
his
basis
is
a
$100.
essentially,
the
basis
is
the
amount
he
paid
for
the
building,
a
$100.
the
$10
payment
which
comes
back,
and
which
is
set
off
against
the
$100
payment,
doesn't
affect
his
basis
because
it
goes
into
his
income.
and
it
has
to
be
that
way
because
if
that
went
on
for
10
years
and
his
basis
was
only
$90,
he
would
have
taken
into
income
a
total
of
a
hundred
dollars,
$10
each
year.
but
only
gotten
depreciation
deductions
of
$90
and
that
wouldn't
be
right
since
he
didn't
have
any
net
--
he
clearly
didn't
have
any
net
gain.
so,
i
think
that
shows
in
a
rather
simple
form,
that
an
amount
which
the
buyer
takes
into
income
which
is
offset
against
the
amount
he
pays
doesn't
affect
his
basis.
on
the
other
hand,
an
amount
he
pays
which
he
deducts
does
not
affect
his
basis,
take
same
situation
of
buying
a
building
and
suppose
that
here
the
agreement
obligates
the
buyer
to
invest
$10
in
advertising,
his
supposed
part
of
a
real
estate
development
and
he
must
invest
$10
in
addition
to
the
hundred
dollars
in
the
first
year
in
advertising
the
building
or
his
services
and
suppose
even
then
he
has
to
pay
the
$10
to
the
seller
who's
an
advertising
agency,
and
suppose
that
the
$10
is
deductible
from
ordinary
income,
as
i
suppose
it
would
be.
again,
he
pays
here
a
$110
but
his
basis
isn't
$110,
his
basis
is
only
a
hundred
dollars.
the
only
part
of
the
payment
which
is
capital
is
the
$100,
the
$10
is
deducted
from
ordinary
income.
the
$10
doesn't
go
into
the
basis
computation,
that
has
to
be
true
because
if
the
$10
did
go
into
the
basis
computation,
he
get
a
total
of
$120
deductions
for
only
$110
outlay.
the
outlay
is
a
110,
if
he
got
a
deduction
which
he
did
from
ordinary
incomes
of
paying
$10
and
if
his
basis
was
a
110,
then
he
gets
depreciation
deductions
of
a
110
plus
the
10
he
has
already
got,
and
which
would
be
a
120
for
a
total
payment
of
a
110
which
would
be
wrong.
so
amounts
which
come
in,
which
he
takes
into
income
don't
affect
basis.
amounts
which
he
pays,
which
he
deducts
from
income
don't
affect
basis.
now
those
examples
are
quite
close
to
this
case.
the
only
difference
between
those
and
this
case
is
that
in
this
case,
you
have
those
payments
accompanying
a
purchase
price
adjustment.
but
we
can
make
the
example
just
a
little
bit
more
complicated
and
put
that
in
and
then
i
think
you'll
have
this
precise
case.
suppose
again,
he
buys
the
building
for
a
$100.
suppose
now
that
a
year
or
so
goes
by
and
the
seller
says
to
him,
“you
paid
too
much
for
the
building.”
the
seller
wants
to
give
him
a
refund
because
of
some
ongoing
commercial
relationship
they
have.
“i
will
give
you
back,”
the
seller
says,
“$50
of
what
you
pay.”
now
that
were
all
if
you
just
gave
him
back
the
$50,
his
basis
would
go
down
by
$50,
but
suppose
as
a
condition
of
giving
back,
first
he
says,
“i'll
give
you
back
the
$50
if
you
will
rent
the
building
to
me
for
10
years
and
the
rental
is
payable
--
i
will
pay
you
the
rental
at
the
time
of
the
refund
in
advance
--
rent
the
building
for
one
year
i
suppose,
$10
a
year.”
so
how
much
does
the
seller
pay
the
buyer
back,
$60,
$50
is
the
purchase
price
adjustment,
$10
is
the
advance
rental
payment.
but
the
basis
of
the
buyer
is
reduced
not
by
$60,
only
by
$50
if
that
$10
rental
payment
is
taken
into
income
just
as
in
the
past
example.
now
that's
just
like
the
part
of
this
case
which
involves
the
re
--
the
substituted
charter
hire
and
3.5%
interest.
that's
just
what
happening
in
that
part
of
this
case.
the
government
is
giving
back
the
purchase
price
adjustment,
difference
between
the
price
originally
paid
and
the
statutory
sales
price
and
it's
also
paying
to
the
buyer
some
income
namely,
substituted
charter
hire
and
the
ships
traded-in
and
3.5%
interest
which
by
the
very
terms
of
the
statute
is
taken
into
income
for
income
tax
purposes
in
the
year
1946
and
he
couldn't'
provide
that
any
clear.
now,
if
that
were
all
they
were
in
the
statute,
just
the
purchase
price
adjustment
and
the
return
of
--
and
the
payment
of
substituted
charter
hire,
the
basis
would
be
lowered
not
by
the
whole
amount
in
this
case
the
$29
million
plus
the
$2,600,000
on
line
7,
which
--
and
the
$1
million
on
line
6
which
is
the
substituted
charter
hire
and
interest,
those
amounts
wouldn't
reduce
the
basis
because
those
amounts
had
taken
into
income
for
income
tax
purposes
by
the
taxpayer,
the
basis
would
be
reduced
only
by
the
$20
million.
that's
half
of
this
case.
therefore,
we
submit
that
those
amounts
in
line
6
and
7
substituted
charter
hire
and
a
3.5%
interest
do
not
affect
the
basis.
the
other
half
of
this
case
is
like
the
following
example,
which
is
like
when
i
gave
before.
you
have
the
same
building,
same
hundred
dollars,
the
same
two-year
later
seller
who
decides
that
he
has
paid
too
much
and
wants
to
give
him
back
$50.
but
this
time
as
part
of
the
agreement,
that
he'll
only
give
him
back
the
$50
if
the
buyer
will
agree
to
invest
--
let's
say
$10
in
advertising
which
he
has
to
pay
to
the
seller
who
is
an
advertising
agency.
and
let's
suppose
that
it's
true
that
that
$10
is
deductible
from
ordinary
income
by
the
buyer.
now
if
that's
all
you
have,
what's
--
the
net
payment
is
50
minus
10,
so
it's
only
40,
but
the
basis
isn't
reduced
by
40.
the
basis
is
reduced
by
50.
the
basis
is
reduced
by
the
part
of
the
payment
which
represents
the
return
of
capital
by
the
difference
between
original
price
and
the
new
price.
the
$10
payment
for
advertising
which
is
deductible
from
ordinary
income,
doesn't
affect
the
basis
for
the
reason
i
gave
before.
if
it
did,
you
deduct
that
amount
twice.
that's
just
like
the
part
of
this
case
which
involves
the
payment
of
charter
hire
by
the
applicant
back
to
the
united
states.
that
payment
is
a
condition
of
receiving
the
adjustment.
the
adjustment
comes
to
him,
he
must
pay
the
charter
hire
back.
for
the
payment
of
the
adjustment
to
the
applicant,
there
are
no
income
tax
consequences
imposed.
but,
for
the
payment
of
the
charter
hire
back
to
the
government,
there
are
income
tax
consequences.
essentially,
that
amount
is
taken
out
of
the
applicant's
income
for
the
years
when
it
was
received.
it
amounts
to
precisely
a
deduction
from
ordinary
income
for
that
amount
of
$13
million,
it's
a
deductible
payment.
well,
a
deductible
payment
is
i
think
i
have
demonstrated
before,
does
not
affect
the
basis.
therefore,
that
amount
of
charter
hire
which
is
paid
back
to
the
government
under
section
9(b)
6
of
the
act,
on
which
federal
income
taxes
are
forgiven
because
of
the
effect
of
9(c)
1
of
the
act,
doesn't
affect
the
basis.
so
the
basis
you
come
out
with
here,
is
simply
the
amount
of
the
purchase
price
adjustment
which
is
paid
back
the
first
part
of
the
adjustment
i
described,
which
doesn't
affect
--
which
doesn't
have
any
federal
income
tax
consequences.
the
only
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
ground
on
which
you
can
dispute
that
analysis
is
by
saying,
as
petitioner
does
say,
that
in
fact
federal
income
tax
consequences
are
not
imposed
upon
these
payments
in
parts
two
and
three
of
the
adjustment.
he
says,
“federal
income
tax
consequences
are
not
imposed
on
the
payment
of
substituted
charter
hire
income,
not
imposed
on
the
payment
of
the
3.5%
interest
and
on
the
other
hand,
deductions
are
not
given
for
the
payment
of
charter
hire
back
to
the
government.”
now
if
that
were
true,
petitioner
would
be
right,
but
it
just
isn't
so.
and
it
isn't
so
because
the
act
provide
as
clearly
as
it
could
possibly
provide
the
federal
income
tax
consequences
are
imposed
on
those
payments,
and
that
as
i
say
is
provided
in
9(b)
8
and
9(c)
1.
9(c)
compels
an
applicant
for
adjustment
as
a
means
of
getting
the
adjustment
to
sign
an
agreement,
binding
upon
the
act
in
any
affiliated
interest
and
the
agreement
is
in
three
parts.
one,
he's
got
to
agree
that
depreciation
and
amortization
already
taken
shall
not
be
treated
as
allowable
for
federal
tax
purposes.
two,
amounts
credit
to
the
secretary
that
charter
hire
he
pays
shall
be
treated
for
federal
income
tax
purposes
as
not
having
been
received,
that
is,
he
gets
a
deduction
for
them
in
the
re-computation
of
taxes.
three,
amounts
he
gets
on
the
95
and
6,
the
substituted
charter
hire
interest
payments
are
treated
as
income
for
federal
income
tax
purposes
in
the
taxable
year
of
the
enactment
of
the
act,
1946.
then
after
he
signs
that
agreement,
section
9(b)
8
provides
that,
they
shall
be
subtracted
from
the
credits
in
favor
of
the
secretary
the
amount
of
any
over
payments
of
federal
taxes
of
the
applicant
resulting
from
that
agreement.
and
i
don't
see
how
that
could
be
any
clear
that
if
he
has
overpaid
taxes
because
he
paid
taxes
on
the
charter
hire
which
you
shouldn't
pay
and
he
gets
the
taxes
back,
those
amounts
shall
be
treated
as
credits
and
also
any
deficiencies
in
the
next
sentence
shall
be
treated
as
credits
and
their
deficiencies
in
federal
income
tax
of
--
deficiencies
in
federal
income
tax.
then
when
you
come
to
the
end
of
subsection
9(b)
8,
provides
that
upon
such
payment
by
the
secretary,
such
overpayment
shall
be
treated
as
having
been
refunded
and
such
deficiencies
as
having
been
paid.
again,
it
clearly
emphasizes
that
the
effect
of
this
statute
is
to
re-compute
the
income
taxes
and
to
treat
any
deficiencies
or
over
payments
resulting
from
the
re-computation
as
paid,
satisfied,
obligation
finished,
taxes
have
been
recomputed.
well,
if
–
as
i
tried
to
show,
if
you
re-compute
the
taxes
in
that
manner,
the
only
part
of
this
adjustment
which
can
possibly
affect
basis
is
the
part
of
this
adjustment
upon
which
no
federal
taxes
are
imposed
and
that
is
the
difference
to
credit
in
subsections
9(b)
1
through
subsection
9(b)
4,
the
credit
for
the
difference
between
the
price
actually
paid
by
the
applicant
and
the
statutory
price.
and
is
--
mr.
paul
bender
no.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
his
investment
is
not
$26
million
because
$8
million
of
that
$26
million
was
deducted
from
his
income
for
federal
tax
purposes
and
amounts
which
you
deduct
from
your
income
for
federal
tax
purposes
can't
possibly
constitute
investment,
for
federal
tax
purposes.
mr.
paul
bender
the
money
he
pays?
mr.
paul
bender
well,
he
originally
paid
47
and
if
you
view
it
that
way,
that
he
originally
paid
47
and
only
got
back
20
--
46
only,
he
got
back
20,
it
would,
but
that
doesn't
take
into
account
the
$13
million
that
he
got
during
the
--
mr.
paul
bender
no,
he
won't
because
he
has
received
$13
million
in
charter
hire
from
the
government
during
the
war.
if
you're
just
going
to
look
at
net
cash
payments
mr.
justice
white,
you
have
to
take
into
account
the
net
cash
payment
of
$13
million.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
let's
give
him
the
$46
million.
let's
suppose
he
has
paid
that
all
in
cash.
mr.
paul
bender
now
during
the
war,
the
government
paid
him
$13
million
and
after
the
war,
when
he
applies
for
an
adjustment,
he
pays
the
government
back
$20
million,
i
mean
the
government
pays
him
back
$20
million.
so
the
government
has
paid
him
a
total
of
$13
million
plus
$20
million.
he's
paid
the
government
a
total
of
$46
million.
if
you're
going
to
look
at
how
much
cash
he's
paid,
you
take
$46
million
and
deduct
the
total
amount
the
government's
paid
him,
namely
$13
million
--
mr.
paul
bender
well
but
after
the
adjustment
is
paid,
the
charter
hire
payments
haven't
had
income
tax
consequences
anymore
because
the
taxes
have
been
forgiven
on
those
amounts.
mr.
paul
bender
well,
i
don't
--
when
you
say,
it
paid
out
$26
million,
i
don't
know
quite
what
figure
you
have
referenced
to
it.
if
you're
just
going
to
look
at
the
cash
which
pass
between
the
government
and
the
taxpayer,
they
didn't
pay
the
government
26
million
--
mr.
paul
bender
because
the
$13
million
came
back
there.
mr.
paul
bender
no,
it's
not
being
given
back.
they
only
gave
back
20
million,
and
they've
given
--
if
the
13
--
if
they
got
the
$13
million,
then
they
get
another
$20
million.
the
$13
million
is
not
coming
back,
they're
simply
getting
$20
million
rather
than
a
larger
amount
they
would
have
gotten
if
the
$13
million
hasn't
been
paid
back.
if
you're
going
to
forget
about
the
original
payment
of
$13
million,
you're
taking
that
into
account
twice.
mr.
paul
bender
yes
essentially,
but
i
want
to
emphasize
that
if
you
just
look
at
the
cash
paid
by
the
taxpayer
in
this
case,
it
does
not
amount
to
$26
million,
it
amounts
to
considerably
less
than
that.
mr.
paul
bender
he
would
have
a
higher
tax
basis
than
those
people.
mr.
paul
bender
that
would
mean
that
each
year,
he
could
take
a
larger
deduction
from
his
income
for
federal
tax
purposes
than
those
people.
therefore,
if
they
each
received
the
same
amount
of
gross
income,
$10
million
let's
say,
and
if
he
was
able
to
take
a
$2
million
deduction
but
they
only
a
$1
million
deduction.
those
deductions
don't
represent
any
payment,
they
simply
represent
the
amortization.
he
would
have
a
lower
taxable
income
than
his
competitors
on
exactly
the
same
gross
income
and
that
would
give
him
a
competitive
advantage,
lower
taxable
income
means
a
higher
after
tax
income.
