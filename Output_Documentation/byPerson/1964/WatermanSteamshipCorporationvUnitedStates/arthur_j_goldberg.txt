mr.
bender,
where
in
your
chart
on
page
7
does
he
give
back
the
depreciation?

[inaudible]
justice
arthur

[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.

[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
actually
what
you're
saying
is
that
they've
paid
on
$26
million,
a
sum
that
was
paid
in
the
form
of
interest,
charter
hire
and
so
on,
and
not
as
part
of
the
investment,
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
because
they
have
some
offsetting
amounts.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
but
of
course,
the
$13
million
is
now
being
cashed
back.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that's
your
other
argument,
your
alternate
argument
that
you
are
making?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
take
you
drew
some
figures.
do
you
dispute
the
fact
that
you
received
from
the
government
$20,468,904
plus
$13,430,431?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now
will
you
tell
me
why
you
dispute
that?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
because
net
payment
to
the
waterman,
$20,468,904.
now
item
number
10
and
then
charter
hire
from
the
government,
$13,430,431.
now,
those
are
two
items
which
as
i
understood
the
argument
you
received,
is
that
wrong?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
that's
equivalent.
i
understand
that,
that
the
re-computing,
but
i
want
to
now
take,
forget
about
all
the
argument.
let's
talk
about
straight
cash
in
flow,
the
waterman,
just
straight
cash.
during
the
period
you
operated,
the
charter
hire
to
the
government
during
the
war,
you
received
$13,430,431
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well
tell
me
why
it
isn't
correct
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
i
thought
you
just
said,
that
you
got
it
on
a
reduction
of
mortgage
indebtedness
which
is
the
same
as
getting
it.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
understand
that,
but
i'm
--
i'm
just
trying
to
get
the
net
amount
after
without
the
consequences
which
we
have
to
determine.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
did
you
in
fact
receive
$13,000,430
and
a
credit
of
$20,468,904?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
alright.
did
you
receive
a
credit
on
your
mortgage
indebtedness
at
$20,468,904?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
understand.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
again,
i'm
not
talking
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
about
the
consequence,
i
want
to
establish
the
fact.
the
fact
is
that
waterman
received,
in
cash
and
credit
$33,898,904,
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
but
is
that
a
correct
fact?
justice
arthur
j.
