justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
mcconnell,
do
you
agree
that
this
transaction
has
to
be
unwind?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
much
depreciation
did
you
take
on
all
--
the
total
depreciation
that
you
take
on
these
18
vessels
up
until
the
time
of
the
price
adjusted?
it
is
about
$10
million
or
$11
million
somewhere
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
you
should
have
gotten
the
income
taxes
back
that
you
paid
before
this,
before
the
adjustment
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
you
should
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
requires
you
to
get
them
back,
get
the
tax
back,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
requires
you
to
get
the
return
of
charter
hire?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
requires
you
to
be
paid
for
your
--
what
you
would
have
earned
on
all
these
vessels
if
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
you
are
entitled
any
credits
before
the
act
went
into
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
up
to
the
period
of
the
time
you
bought
the
vessels
up
to
the
price
adjustment
statute,
are
you
entitled
to
any
credits
at
all
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that
mr.
mcconnell?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
why
is
it?
why
--
why
do
you
suppose
that
is
the
formula?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
act
--
the
act
expressly
requires
that
the
party
goes
through
some
adjustment
procedures
with
regard
to
the
period
prior
to
the
price
of
yesterday?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
statutory,
is
the
statutory
sales
price
under
the
new
act
you
were
supposed
to
pay
something
like
how
much?
justice
byron
r.
white
$18
million.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
statutory
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
prior
to
the
time
of
the
establishment
of
this
price
you
would
have
taken
approximately
$11
million
worth
of
depreciation?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
a
minute,
you
say
you
took
$11
million
for
depreciation
prior
to
the
establishment
of
this
price
and
you
want
your
basis
to
remain
at
26,
so
that
in
the
long
run
you
want
to
say
that
you
could
take
$26
million
plus
$11,
the
$38
million
in
depreciation
against
vessels
which
cost
you
$18
million.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right,
well
i
know,
but
you
still
want
to
be
able
to
take
$26
million
of
depreciation,
that's
what
this
fight
is
all
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you've
already
had
11.
justice
byron
r.
white
arriving
after
the
adjustment,
however,
would
you
apply
this
$20,468
million
in
arriving
at
that
adjustment,
that's
the
result
--
that's
the
net
result
of
a
computation,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
take
exception
to
the
figures
on
page
7
of
the
government's
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
arrive
at
the
$20,468
million?
you
just
don't
pick
it
out
of
the
air,
you
must
calculate
it
somehow?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
that
calculation
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
where?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
that
adjustment
in
mortgage
indebtedness
that
24.68,
where
does
that
24.68
come
from?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
understand
that,
but
now
how
about
--
where
do
you
get
the
17
up
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
involves
then
on
page
67,
the
united
states
returning
income
taxes
and
the
applicants
are
the
returning
charter
hire.
this
is
all
figured
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
it's
an
offset.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
and
you
think
that
the
united
states
in
the
whole
process
shouldn't
demand
back
the
new
depreciation
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
why
did
you
take
it
back?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
then
the
problem
isn't
about
the
$26
million
that
this
economic
investment.
the
problem
is
i
suppose
that
if
he
has
an
economic
investment
of
$26
million,
how
can
you
say
he
is
entitled
to
$26
million
depreciation?
isn't
the
fact
however,
that
reason
that
he
only
get
$17
million
from
now
on
in
your
view
rather
than
$26
million
if
you
thought
of
the
only
way
you
can
get
the
depreciation
back
on
your
inner
--
on
your
mutual
debits
and
credits
is
by
doing
it
this
way.
i
mean,
this
is
the
only
way
the
depreciation
is
returned
to
you
is
he
took?
justice
byron
r.
white
we're
on
page
7
--
where
on
page
7
in
the
unwinding
operations
as
the
government
takes
back
depreciation?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
it.
isn't
it
hidden
in
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
we
want
the
taxes
paid.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
line
is
that?
line
8,
a
brief
of
the
tax
if
actually
paid
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
the
basis
is
returned
in
line
1,
otherwise
we
start
with
the
lower
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
but
as
of
the
time
you
started
the
computation
the
basis
is
actually
lower
than
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
you're
taking
the
basis
back.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
line
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
bender,
are
these
examples
and
what
you've
been
saying
that
really
help
us
in
trying
to
understand
why
--
well
first,
do
you
agree
that
the
investment
here
was
$26
million?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
time
that
he's
paid
cash
in
the
past,
cash
down
and
he
made
payments
on
the
mortgage
and
he
still
has
a
part
of
the
mortgage
to
pay
or
by
the
time
he
gets
through
paying
the
mortgage
and
you
add
that
to
his
cash
payments
and
his
down
payments,
trade-ins,
will
it
be
26
million
or
more?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
i
want
to
know
that
is
what
want
to
ask,
i
asked
whether
or
not
the
money
he
pays
to
the
government
will
total
$26
million
or
whether
it
won't
--
whether
it
will
or
it
won't?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
purchase
price.
the
cash
he
has
paid
at
the
outset,
the
trade-ins,
the
payments
on
the
mortgage
and
the
balance
due
on
the
mortgage
as
of
now,
by
the
time
he
has
paid
the
mortgage
off,
will
all
of
his
payments
over
to
the
government
will
be
$26
million?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that,
but
--
will
he
pay
over
$26
million?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
how
about
the
net
cash
payments
on
the
purchase
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
--
let's
set
aside
what
you
said
was
–
he
had
income
tax
consequences.
i
was
going
to
put
aside
the
charter
hire
payments?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
there
a
lot
of
points
that
it
wasn't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
think
that
you
might
owe
the
government
some
charter
hire
in
return
of
charter
hire
that
you
supposed
to
pay
them
back
for
the
–
and
part
of
its
wrapped
up
in
the
mortgage?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
agree,
then
i
suppose
that
the
net
credit
here
of
8(a)
is
right,
$8
million,
$8
is
right?
that
you
agree
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
agree
with
lines
4,
5,
6,
7
and
8?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
credit.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
must
agree
then
if
the
net
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
and
the
government
still
seem
to
be
talking
about
the
same
factors
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
same
language
or
even
the
same
transaction.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
suppose
that
they're
making
these
adjustments
on
these
lines
from
4
to
8.
suppose
that
each
of
you
have
just
written
a
check
for
the
--
a
separate
check
for
each
amount,
you
would
have
written
the
check
for
the
government
for
13
million
and
the
government
written
checks
for
these
other
two
items
--
other
three
items
to
use,
separate
checks,
now
you
just
deliver
them
to
each
other
and
consequently,
there
wouldn't
have
been
any
net
credit
you
would
already
have
paid
each
other
off.
now,
the
economic
effect
of
that
i
suppose
should
be
the
same
as
this
arrangement.
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
that
be
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
but
isn't
--
wouldn't
--
shouldn't
it
be
the
same
that
economic
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
economic
effects
should
be
the
same
either
way,
shouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
would
exchange
checks
--
if
you
had
just
exchanged
checks,
well
you
would
have
had
the
result
of
lines
1,
2,
and
3,
wouldn't
you
insofar
as
purchase
price
would
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
they
would
have
had
to
give
you
a
$29
million
credit
on
the
purchase
price?
