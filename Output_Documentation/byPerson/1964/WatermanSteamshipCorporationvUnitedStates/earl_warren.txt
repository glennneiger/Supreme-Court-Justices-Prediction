mr.
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
motion
is
granted.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcconnell?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
accomplish
what
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
was
it
--
my
point
was
this,
was
it
to
equate
the
price
of
those
ships
that
were
purchased
during
the
war
with
those
that
were
purchased
after
wards?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
does
the
question
of
whether
the
price
of
these
ships
that
were
purchased
during
the
war
and
those
after
the
war
were
the
same
after
the
formula
was
applied
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they're
not
the
same?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
we
can
approach
the
case
as
far
you're
concerned
on
the
basis
that
the
relative
cost
of
the
ships
that
were
purchased
during
the
war
and
those
that
were
purchased
after
wards
is
immaterial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bender.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bender,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
[inaudible]
the
appellant
should
prevail
in
this
case
on
his
theory,
what
preference
would
he
have
or
what
benefits
would
he
have
over
and
above,
those
that
were
acquired
by
someone
who
bought
the
same
ships
under
the
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
mcconnell?
