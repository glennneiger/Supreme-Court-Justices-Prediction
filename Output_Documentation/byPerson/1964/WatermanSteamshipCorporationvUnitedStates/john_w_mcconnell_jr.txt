mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
one
of
the
counsel
of
record
for
the
petitioner
here,
waterman
steamship
corporation,
we
feel
that
we
have
a
case
with
a
very
limited
yet
clear
issue
and
result.
we
ought
to
emphasize
the
issue
because
if
the
issue
is
kept
in
proper
perspective,
we
believe
then
that
the
result
will
fall
as
contended
by
the
petitioner.
this
is
a
tax
case
and
we
maintain
that
it
concerns
the
application
of
the
usual
rules
on
the
internal
revenue
code
and
the
1939
code
is
the
one
that
controls
this
case
by
determining
the
cost
or
the
tax
basis
of
property,
the
original
price
of
which
property
was
adjusted
downward
in
pursuant
to
a
statute
passed
by
congress,
which
had
a
limited
purpose
and
which
did
not
have
anything
in
the
statute
specifying
the
tax
effect
which
is
the
issue
before
this
court.
it
is
not
concerned
with
a
tax
statute
per
se,
but
rather
with
a
general
statute
with
rather
limited
applications,
but
with
no
specified
tax
effects.
however,
like
any
other
general
statute,
it
may
have
tax
effects
and
did
have
tax
effects,
but
again,
it's
concerned
as
we
see
it,
not
having
specific
or
specified
tax
effects
in
the
statute
that
it
is
then
to
be
determined
and
controlled
by
the
usual
rules
of
determining
cost
under
the
1939
code.
we
do
not
think
that
it
is
concerned
with
statutory
construction.
we
think
the
statute
is
rather
clear
and
explicit.
it
does
not,
we
think,
involve
or
need
a
study
of
the
legislative
history
or
legislative
environment
again
because
of
the
face
of
the
statute
the
meaning
and
effect
is
clear.
there
are
two
statutes
involved
in
general.
one,
the
merchant
ship
sales
act
of
1946
which
was
enacted
or
came
into
effect
on
march
8,
1946,
after
a
study
over
about
a
2-year
period
in
congress.
the
statute
in
general
related
to
the
disposition
after
the
war,
of
the
vessels
that
had
been
constructed
and
most
of
them
owned
by
the
government
during
the
war.
now
a
subsidiary
question
arose
and
that
was,
what
would
be
done
to
those
persons
or
those
corporations
that
had
purchased
vessels
during
the
war
at
the
war
time
cost
and
that
these
vessels
that
were
going
to
be
sold
after
the
war
were
going
to
be
sold
at
less
than
war
time
cost,
what
adjustment
would
be
made
to
those
individuals
who
had
purchased
during
the
war
at
a
higher
price?
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
to
accomplish
the
purpose
your
honor
was
to
get
private
shipping
or
to
get
shipping
back
into
the
private
industry
in
a
sense
that
the
conclusion
of
war
most
of
it
would
have
been
owned
and
in
the
hands
of
the
government.
now
the
question
was,
what
would
be
the
price
at
which
these
vessels
would
be
sold
to
any
prospective
purchaser?
keeping
in
mind
in
our
case
your
honor,
waterman
had
purchased
18
of
these
vessels
from
the
government
during
the
war
and
purchased
them
at
their
cost
during
the
war.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
after
the
war,
the
so-called
statutory
sales
price
as
set
out
in
the
act,
would
be
a
lower
price
than
the
cost
of
construction
during
the
war.
now
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
it
was
taken
to
consideration,
your
honor,
the
fact
that
the
ones
purchased
in
the
war
had
been
purchased
at
a
higher
price.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
now,
it
did
not
specify
that
it
would
be
changed,
adjusted
to
the
price
at
which
they
would
be
sold
after
the
war,
but
rather
the
statute
set
out
in
one
section
on
the
section
9
which
pertain
to
prior
sales,
section
9b
set
out
the
formula
to
be
followed
in
adjusting
the
price
of
those
purchased
previously
during
war
time.
now,
we
say
here
that
the
statute
is
clear.
i
don't
think
there's
any
arguing
with
the
government
as
to
how
to
apply.
the
issue
facing
the
court
here
is
the
effect
of
that
adjustment
provided
under
the
statute
on
the
cost
or
tax
basis
of
these
vessels
whose
prices
were
adjusted
down.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
we
maintain
that
they're
not
the
same
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
we
can
show
that
and
we
feel
that
that's
the
heart
of
this
issue,
is
that
we
can
show
that
under
the
normal
code
rules,
the
basis
of
property
for
depreciation
purpose,
and
that's
the
question
here,
is
the
cost
of
that
property
to
the
taxpayer,
the
taxpayer's
economic
investment.
now,
that's
the
normal
code
rule.
now,
there's
nothing
specific
in
the
statute
that
says
that
that
normal
code
rule
will
not
apply
here.
there's
nothing
specific
in
the
statute
that
says,
the
price
after
the
adjustment
is
the
statutory
sales
price.
the
statute
simply
sets
out
a
formula
for
determining
an
adjustment
in
price.
there's
no
argument
about
this
adjustment.
now,
we
say
that
thereafter
it's
a
simple
matter
of
mathematics.
it
was
stipulated
here
and
agreed
what
the
basis
of
the
property
was
prior
to
the
adjustment.
it
is
stipulated
and
agreed
here
what
the
adjustment
was.
it's
stipulated
and
agreed
here
what
is
the
basis
after
the
judgment
except
on
the
tax
basis.
now,
we
say
though
applying
the
normal
1939
internal
revenue
code
rule
that
you
will
come
up
here
with
a
basis
of
approximately
$26
million
as
contended
by
petitioner
as
against
the
approximately
$17
to
$18
million
contended
by
the
government.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
we
--
that's
right
sir.
we
maintain
that
the
statute
does
not
provide
though
the
prices
of
the
vessels
purchased
during
the
war
and
whose
prices
are
adjusted
are
adjusted
to
the
statutory
sales
price,
that's
correct
sir.
our
contention
is
they
are
not
adjusted
to
the
statutory
sales
price.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
no,
sir.
we
do
not
believe
that
this
is
an
unwinding
transaction.
we
believe
that's
an
adjustment
transaction
that
an
unwinding
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
i
think
the
figures
that
were
quoted
in
the
government's
brief
are
correct
because
they're
taken
except
for
the
final
from
the
record
here
which
indicated
some
$11
million
at
one
time.
that
--
that
we
do
not
contend
that
we
had
not
taken
that
amount
of
appreciation
prior
to
the
adjustment.
however,
we
say
this
that
the
adjustment
under
9(b)
is
one
adjustment.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
we
don't
think
that
we
got
them
back
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
well,
we
think
this
that
we
had
to
follow
the
conditions
as
outlined
in
the
act
in
order
to
get
the
adjustment
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
no,
sir.
we
do
not
interpret
your
honor
that
it
requires
us
to
get
the
tax
back
or
that
we
got
the
tax
back.
it
is
simply
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
no,
sir.
we
don't
think
that.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
that
is
a
part
of
the
credits
and
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
entitled
any
credits
before
that
or
you
mean
for
transaction?
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
entitled
to
all
the
credits
that
the
section
9(b)
gives
us.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
alright.
the
first
credit
is
the
one
for
the
excess
cash
payments
over
25%
that's
sub
paragraph
one.
another
credit
is
for
3
1/2%
interests
on
that
excess
cash
payments
from
the
date
of
payments.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
that's
the
statutory
formula
which
the
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
well,
i
think
now
undoubtedly
mr.
justice
white
that
the
original
legislation
intended
that
this
go
down
to
the
statutory
sales
price.
in
fact,
the
senate
bill,
the
amendment
of
this
would
have
adjusted
this
down
and
any
taxpayer
taken
an
adjustment
would
have
received
the
difference
between
the
purchase
price
before
the
act
and
the
statutory
sales
price.
he
would
have
gotten
that
completely
without
giving
any
credits,
tax
or
otherwise,
although
he
would
have
it
returned
to
the
government
everything
over
15%
of
the
statutory
sales
price
as
far
as
charter
had,
but
that
was
not
the
act
that
was
passed.
now,
this
was
amended
and
they
set
up
this
morning.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
one
adjustment
your
honor,
it
requires
an
adjustment
in
price,
that's
what
all
of
the
section
9
(b)
speaks
off
is
an
adjustment
in
price.
now,
we
say
that
any
sale
or
any
purchase,
who
purchases
property
by
certain
price,
he
gets
an
adjustment.
now,
that
adjustment
maybe
based
on
a
thousand
different
computations,
but
he
ends
up
with
an
adjustment
in
price
which
he
applies
to
the
original
price
and
then
he
gets
his
adjusted
price.
now
that's
what
we
say
here.
you
start
out
with
the
original
price.
you
have
an
adjustment
in
price.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
well,
these
vessels
statutory
sales
price
of
the
18
vessels
would
have
been
slightly
less
than
$18
million.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
that's
a
statutory
price.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
that's
right
sir.
we
had
also
paid
approximately
$16
million
in
cash
and
still
that
--
oh,
after
the
adjustment.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
your
honor,
we
think
that
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
well
of
course,
the
$11
million
is
actual
depreciation
as
i
recall
and
the
$26
million
would
still
be
whatever
the
tax
rate
of
that
amount.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
we
would
take
depreciation
on
a
basis
after
the
adjustment
of
$26
million,
that's
right.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
we
had
taken
approximately
11
prior
to
the
adjustment
that's
right,
but
as
--
along
that
line,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
this
fact
as
to
what
we
think
the
cost
of
these
vessels
and
what
we
think
the
record
indicates
clearly
is
the
cost
of
these
vessels
to
this
tax
player
and
the
economic
investment
of
this
taxpayer
in
these
vessels.
now,
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
act,
prior
to
the
adjustment,
it
is
stipulated
that
the
basis
of
these
18
vessels,
the
cost
to
this
taxpayer
was
slightly
in
excess
of
$47
million
dollars
and
i
believe
that
there
has
been
distributed
to
your
honors
two
computations
here,
single
sheets,
asked
the
clerk
to,
to
indicating
this
breakdown.
first,
it
shows
that
total
cash
payment
and
the
trade
in
allowances
on
these
18
vessels
up
to
the
day
before
the
act,
the
day
preceding
that.
now,
the
adjustment
was
made
many
years
later,
but
as
other
day
to
the
act.
this
taxpayer
had
paid
in
cash
or
trade
in
for
these
vessels
$16,411,000.
now,
the
remaining
mortgage
and
indebtedness
on
date,
this
is
before
the
adjustment,
was
$30,737,000.
now,
we
applied
to
the
commissioner
for
an
adjustment
in
price,
an
adjustment
in
price
on
18
vessels.
now,
the
adjustment
was
branded
under
section
9
(b),
an
adjustment
price.
this
adjustment
reduced
that
mortgage
indebtedness
from
$30
million
to
$10
million,
a
$20
million
reduction
and
price
all
in
the
mortgage
indebtedness.
now
we
say
that
you
subtract
that
$20
million
from
the
$47
million
basis
prior
to
the
adjustment
and
the
cost
of
this
taxpayer
is
the
$16
million
odd
paid
prior
to
the
adjustment,
the
$10
million
odd
mortgage
indebtedness
remaining
after
the
adjustment
or
as
i
said,
taking
the
original
cost
subtracting
the
adjustment,
leaves
a
basis
of
$26
million.
now
we
say
that
that
follows
not
because
we
necessarily
want
it
that
way,
but
because
that's
the
way
the
statute
prescribes,
that's
all
the
statute
prescribes.
the
statute
did
not
prescribe
that
the
basis
would
be
the
statutory
sales
price.
the
statute
simply
prescribes
an
adjustment
in
price.
this
taxpayer
received
that
adjustment.
we
maintain
then
that
you
look
back
to
the
usual
1939
code
provisions
to
then
see
what
is
the
cost
of
the
property.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
the
formula
has
several
computations.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
very
much
so.
we
think
that
there
is
no
basis
in
the
language
or
the
structure.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it's
calculated.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
in
our
brief
--
it's
not
in
the
brief,
it's
in
the
appendices
and
in
records
though
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
if
your
honor
will
turn
in
the
appendices
to
appendix
e,
the
computations
that
are
there
and
if
you
look
on
e2
under
number
6,
total
mortgage
adjustments
which
is
taken
as
indicated
there
from
the
page
48
of
the
record,
which
is
a
stipulation
between
the
parties.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
alright,
if
you'll
look
there
your
honor
at
e2
at
computation
6,
it
gives
a
balance
of
the
original
mortgage
indebtedness
as
of
march
7,
1946,
that's
the
day
before
the
act.
this
is
stipulated
in
the
record
page
41.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
alright
sir.
that
is
taken
right
out
of
sub
paragraph
2
of
the
act
on
the
adjustment
which
reads
as
follows.
the
applicant's
indebtedness
under
any
mortgage
of
the
united
states
with
respect
to
the
vessel
shall
be
adjusted.
and
the
next
sub
paragraph
says,
the
adjusted
mortgage
indebtedness
shall
be
an
amount
equal
to
the
excess
of
the
statutory
sales
price
of
the
vessel
as
of
the
day
of
enactment
of
this
act
over
the
sum
of
the
cash
payment
retained
by
the
united
states
under
paragraph
one.
now
paragraph
one
says,
you'll
pay
25%
statutory
sales
price.
so
if
you
didn't
have
any
trade
in,
the
mortgage
would
be
75%.
now
if
you
--
then
we
get
to
$17
million
by
the
fact
of
looking
at
what
the
--
let
me
just
turn
to
the
record
here,
justice
white
if
you'll
turn
to
page
68
in
the
record.
this
is
a
schedule
which
was
attached
to
the
agreement
between
the
government
and
the
petitioner.
actually
if
you
look
at
page
67
that's
a
double
page
there,
if
you'll
notice
at
the
top,
original
purchase
price,
line
one
last
column
is
total
all
vessels,
it
has
$49
million.
then
the
next
line,
less
there
is
no
trade
in
allowance,
then,
the
next
line
reads
less
balance
of
original
mortgages
up
to
03/08/46,
that's
the
day
before
that
shows
that
the
mortgage
balance
on
that
day
was
$30
million.
now,
when
you
take
--
then
next,
you
notice,
it
says
less
25%
of
adjusted
statutory
sales
price,
that's
the
cash
you're
supposed
to
pay,
then
that
next
line
three
leaves
the
excess
cash
payments.
now
if
you
turn
over
on
68,
it
gives
the
mortgage
adjustment,
starting
with
line
13
at
the
top.
adjusted
statutory
sales
price
so
forth
less
25,
then
line
16
adjusted
mortgages
as
of
03/08/46.
then
line
20
says
reduction
in
mortgage
indebtedness
$20
million.
now
that's
where
we
get,
if
you
take
the
$13
million
adjusted
mortgage
in
line
16,
subtract
it
from
your
mortgage
indebtedness
over
on
the
third
line
on
the
preceding
page
of
$30
million,
that's
where
you
get
to
$17
million
and
it's
in
accordance
with
a
statutory
point.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
we
do
not
--
there's
no
return
of
charter
hire,
your
honor,
it's
a
credit.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
it's
a
credit.
that's
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
and
that's
what
in
other
words
in
section
9
(b)
you
have
several
credits
which
must
be
netted
together.
now
that's
a
reason
we
disagree
with
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
we
stand
that
on
this
premise
that
the
statute
allowed
us
these
credits
and
section
9(c)(1),
which
has
limited
effect
said
that
you
would
take
that
adjustment
from
the
original
purchase
price
and
the
result
would
be
the
adjusted
purchase
price
and
we
say
the
tax
basis.
now,
we're
not
arguing
with
the
philosophy
of
the
act.
we
just
say
we
take
the
act
as
passed
by
congress
and
you
apply
the
act,
and
we
don't'
argue
about
the
adjustment
between
us.
it's
simply
on
the
effect
and
we
say
that
the
act
does
not
specify
the
basics.
and
therefore,
you
go
to
the
1939
code
provision
and
there's
a
sheet
before
your
justices
will
indicate,
this
taxpayer
paid
$26
million
for
these
vessels
after
the
adjustment
and
this
taxpayer
is
seeking
no
more
than
every
other
taxpayer
and
that
is
to
be
allowed
to
depreciate
those
vessels
on
the
remaining
life
on
that
cost
and
that
economic
investment.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
well,
as
we
pointed
out,
your
honor,
if
they
give
them
an
adjustment
that's
up
to
congress.
congress
gave
us
the
adjustment
and
we
say
that
congress
left
to
the
normal
rule
how
the
basis
would
be
computing
and
the
normal
rule
say
that
it's
$26
million.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
well,
we
pointed
out
in
one
of
the
footnotes,
a
case
similar
to
that,
although
actually
as
it
turned
out
that
they
didn't
adjust
it,
they
wrote
a
new
contract.
now,
we
say
that
then
the
net
effect
of
that
adjustment
would
be
determined
under
the
normal
rules
and
that
would
be
the
basis.
in
other
words,
if
you
bought
it
for
$100
and
it
gave
a
price
adjustment
of
$20
and
the
new
cost
would
be
$80.
and
it
wouldn't
matter,
and
this
is
what
we
think
is
a
key
to
mr.
justice
white,
it
wouldn't
matter,
how
you
arrived
with
the
$20.
you
might
say
now,
you
earned
income
of
$10,
you
paid
taxes
of
$2,
you
had
a
--
you
paid
property
taxes
or
something
else,
or
you
say
i
will
give
you
$1
for
every
child
you
have.
that's
part
of
the
computation
and
you
end
up
with
$20.
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
factor
that
you
use
to
measure
the
adjustment.
the
key
thing
is
the
amount
of
adjustment
you
apply
that
to
the
price
and
the
result
is
your
basis,
regardless
of
how
it
was
computed.
now
that's
our
contingent.
we
say
you
take
section
9
(b)
which
has
a
point
made
up
of
several
factors
of
several
computations,
but
it
doesn't'
matter
what
they
are
measured
by.
you
take
them
and
as
a
result
of
the
adjustment,
one
single
adjustment.
you
simply
either
subtract
that
from
the
original
purchase
price
to
give
you
a
new
price
or
you
can
do
it
in
a
reverse
as
we
we
did
on
this
sheet
show
how
much
had
been
paid
before,
what
was
the
adjusted
mortgage
indebtedness,
the
sum
of
the
two
would
be
the
basis
of
property
for
depreciation.
now,
we
do
not
think
that
it
has
any
unwinding
involved,
that
was
a
statute
that
was
rejected.
an
adjustments
is
not
an
unwinding.
an
adjustment
confirms
the
original
purchase.
in
fact
in
the
contract
itself,
this
is
recognized
and
in
the
regulations
issued
by
maritime
that
they
would
have
to
execute
an
addendum
to
the
original
contracts
of
purchase.
this
adjustment
was
an
addendum
to
the
original
contracts
of
purchase
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
original
contracts
of
purchase
said
that
we
would
have
the
benefit
of
any
legislation
that
might
be
passed
after
the
purchase
that
allowed
the
same
vessels
to
be
sold
as
subsequent
purchases
at
lower
prices.
now,
that
was
an
original
contract,
but
we
say
that
there
is
not
unwinding
and
we
say
particular
that
the
table
as
contained
in
the
brief
of
the
government
on
page
7
has
no
basis
whatsoever
in
the
statute.
there's
no
place
to
determining
a
gross
price
adjustment
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
if
they
want
to
use
the
term
gross
price
adjustment
as
they've
done
on
line
3
on
page
7,
then
they
should
call
the
last
line
the
net
price
adjustment.
that's
exactly
the
--
that's
the
price
adjustment
that
we
receive
as
indicated
in
their
own
schedule
one
$20
million.
that's
exactly
the
price
adjustment
that
we
receive,
you
subtract
that
from
the
original
price
and
that
gives
you
the
adjusted
purchase
price
and
the
basis
here
for
depreciation
purposes
thereafter.
no
new
mortgages
were
executed.
no
new
notes
were
executed.
the
same
mortgages
were
simply
adjusted.
the
same
notes
were
simply
adjusted
as
the
payment
in
the
future,
so
that
there
is
not
either
a
rescission
nor
is
there
an
unwinding.
now,
we
also
maintain
that
section
and
i
might
touch
on
it
here,
the
section
9
(c)
(1)
this
goes
back
to
justice
white's
question,
that
9
(c)
(1)
explicitly
provides
that
this
adjustment
will
be
applied
against
the
original
purchase
price.
this
is
in
the
condition
section.
the
credits
that
i
was
discussing
with
mr.
justice
white
are
in
the
adjustment
section,
but
the
condition
section
says
that
you
will
for
federal
tax
purposes
treat
as
if
certain
things
had
not
been
done.
that
carried
us
back
to
the
original
purchase
price.
you
then
apply
the
adjustment
on
the
9
(b)
and
you
come
up
with
a
net
result
of
approximately
$26
million.
the
government
would
contend
that
the
statute
says
you
must
come
down
to
the
statutory
sales
price,
but
that
is
not
in
the
statute.
the
statute
simply
contains
a
formula.
the
result
of
which
is
one
adjustment
in
price,
and
the
result
of
that
to
this
taxpayer
is
work
it
either
way.
original
cost
$47
million
adjustment
and
mortgage
indebtedness
or
in
price
$20
million
a
little
more,
the
result
a
basis
or
a
cost
or
an
economic
investment
of
$26
million
or
i
will
look
at
the
other
way.
this
taxpayer
had
paid
$16
million
the
day
before
this
act
was
passed.
the
statutory
sales
price
was
only
$17
million.
now,
it's
still
old
$10
million
more
after
the
adjustment.
yet
the
government
says
you're
going
to
have
a
basis
slightly
in
excess
of
the
cash
already
paid
without
looking
at
the
remaining
obligation.
so
that
we
say
that
anyway
you
look
at
it
on
dollars
and
cents
as
judge
patton
said
in
the
court
of
claims
in
sekone
case,
government
is
saying
it's
not
a
dollars
and
cents,
real
actual
economic
cost,
but
a
hypothetical.
and
we
say
that
the
statute
does
not
require
that
and
that
the
normal
code
rule
justified
the
basis
in
fact
is
the
only
result
of
the
basis
as
contended
by
the
taxpayer.
your
honor,
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
at
all
on
tax
basis,
nothing
on
tax
basis
and
i
don't
think
the
government
haven't
come
up
with
any,
we
haven't
found
any.
we
think
too
that
pulling
out
a
context
just
one
phrase
in
9(b)
about
treating
the
vessel
as
if
it
was
sold
on
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
the
act
and
not
before.
the
government
read
that
in
allowing
them
to
do
anything
to
equalize
the
price
depreciation
of
what
not.
we
simply
say
no.
the
formula
was
congress'
idea
of
exactly
how
that
was
being
done
by
treating
the
vessel
as
if
it
was
sold
on
the
date
of
enactment
act
and
not
before
and
the
formula
carried
that
out
and
it's
not
for
the
government
now
to
try
to
change
the
formula
to
come
back
to
what
they
call
the
congressional
intent
or
legislative
intent.
but
to
answer
your
question
mr.
justice
harlan
on
this
age
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
do
not
think
there's
anything
in
the
legislative
history
on
tax
basis,
but
if
there's
a
resort
to
legislative
history
and
we
do
not
think
it's
necessary.
we
think
that
statute
is
clear
and
unambiguous.
there's
no
necessity
to
legislative
history,
but
if
it
is,
it
supports
petitioner,
both
legislative
history
prior
to
that
and
the
legislative
history
subsequent
to
the
act
supports
the
position
of
the
petitioner
here.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
if
i
may
unless
there's
some
other
questions
at
this
time
for
rebuttal
after
the
government's
argument.
thank
you.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
a
very
short
time
remaining
here
that
i
would
like
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
that
were
raised
and
i
think
if
we're
coming
back
now
to
the
point
at
which
this
should
have
begun
and
on
which
it
shall
be
decided.
and
that
is,
mr.
justice
white's
question
of
how
much
did
this
taxpayer
pay
for
these
vessels.
now
mr.
bender
says,
we
didn't
pay
$26
million,
but
it's
stipulated,
it's
in
the
record.
it's
clear
we
paid
$16
million
before
any
adjustment.
it
is
clear
that
after
the
adjustment,
we
owed
$10
million
more
dollars
which
we
have
paid,
making
a
total
of
$26
million
which
regardless
of
how
it
was
computed
is
the
purchase
price
of
these
18
vessels
and
therefore,
the
economic
investment.
now,
there
have
been
several
questions
asked
about
the
purpose
of
this
of
getting
back
statutory
sales
price,
mr.
chief
justice
asked
this
yesterday.
if
you'll
look
at
the
comparison
of
the
bills
that
we
have
in
our
appendix
c,
showing
the
bills
considered
and
rejected
and
the
bill
adopted,
you
will
see
that
one
of
the
bills
said,
“reduce
it
down
to
the
statutory
sales
price,”
that's
not
the
bill
adopted.
that's
the
computation
you
would
get
from
schedule
1
on
page
7
if
that
bill
had
been
adopted.
however,
it
was
recognized
everywhere
that
the
adjustment
would
not
be
made
down
to
the
statutory
sales
price
and
if
it
was
not
made
to
the
statutory
sales
price,
therefore,
any
taxpayer
who
purchased
before
and
whose
price
were
adjusted
would
pay
more
than
the
statutory
sales
price.
we
paid
$26
million
which
is
more
than
statutory
sales
price.
so
you
do
not
get
it
down
to
the
statutory
sales
price
and
we
submit
that
section
9
(b),
the
application
of
formula,
will
not
produce
this
table,
schedule
1
on
page
7
nor
the
results
contain
therein.
and
it
is
true
that
if
you
look
at
this,
you
will
see
that
the
government
admits
a
net
payment,
and
in
fact
there
was
no
payment,
all
of
this
is
misleading.
if
you
look
at
page
7,
they
talk
about
charter
hire
return.
no
charter
hire
was
returned.
the
bill
rejected
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
exactly
your
honor.
let
me
go
on
and
say
the
effect
of
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
your
honor,
it
actually
wrapped
up
in
the
adjustment.
these
are
a
series
of
credits
leading
to
one
thing.
it's
not
a
division
into
three
adjustments
as
mr.
bender
stated.
you
won't
find
in
section
9(b)
anything
that
will
give
you
lines
1,
2,
and
3
on
his
schedule,
it
just
simply
isn't
there.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
9(b)
8,
9(b)
8
says
that
you
must
--
there
shall
be
subtracted
from
the
sum
of
the
credits
in
favor
of
the
commission
including
the
credit
in
section
1,
where
it
goes
on
down
by
the
taxes,
it
says,
“if
i
have
to
make
any
such
subtractions,
the
sum
of
the
credits
in
favor
of
the
applicants
exceeds
the
sum
of
the
credits
in
favor
of
the
commission,
such
excess
shall
be
paid
by
the
commission
applicant.”
in
other
words
in
sub-paragraph
b,
you
net
all
of
these
credits
together.
include
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
no
sir,
that's
not
the
net
credit
that
you
get
on
the
--
under
this
section.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
line
4
is
a
credit
your
honor
that
--
now
this
is
not
charter
hire
return,
this
is
a
credit
for
charter
hire.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
credit
should
be
the
word
$13
million
is
right
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
--
under
paragraph
6.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
then
the
credit
charter

on
trade-ins
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
--
on
line
6
--
mr.
john

mcconnell,
jr.
--
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
interest,
on
line
7
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
--
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
however,
--
and
also
the
8,
although
there's
no
refund
again
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
that's
debit.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
in
this
case,
it's
a
debit.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
no
sir,
because
they
have
overlooked
this.
there's
no
place
in
there
for
the
credit
for
sub-paragraph
1,
where
we
paid
more
than
the
25%
of
the
statutory
sales
price.
there,
we
got
a
credit
of
sum
of
$11
million.
this
is
on
page
48
of
the
record
your
honor,
stipulated.
now
that's
under
sub-paragraph
1,
that's
the
reason
i
say,
you
can't
get
schedule
one
from
section
9(b),
it's
not
there.
they
overlooked
a
lot
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
we
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
exactly
your
honor.
let
me
just
quote
this
and
to
get
the
examples
that
mr.
bender
gave,
under
section
9(c),
now
we
do
not
say
that
9(c)
1
does
not
have
tax
effects.
we
say
that
the
years
42
through
46
were
re-computed
for
the
purposes
of
section
9(b)
8,
part
of
the
formula,
that's
all,
recomputed.
in
fact,
you'll
find
in
the
record
the
effect
of
this.
on
page
67,
you
can
see
the
tax
effect
of
this
re-computation.
it's
a
67
in
the
record.
if
you'll
look
down
at
line
8,
on
page
67,
this
is
the
sheet
that
has
the
total,
the
last
column
is
the
total.
now
if
you
look
at
this
9(a),
it
says
deduct
overpayment
of
federal
taxes
and
in
the
next
line
and
part
of
the
same
line,
add
deficiencies
of
federal
taxes.
now
over
in
the
right
hand
column,
overpayment
3.5
million,
deficiency
$3
million
and
90.
now,
to
get
to
this
depreciation
that
we've
talked
so
much
about,
depreciation
is
not
something
that
comes
back
in
dollars
and
cents.
depreciation
is
a
deduction
allowed
by
federal
law
on
your
taxes.
now
if
you
have
no
income,
your
depreciation
is
not
going
to
help
you.
all
the
depreciation
may
do
is
either
reduce
your
tax
or
in
this
case
where
we
treat
it
as
not
having
been
allowed,
it
increased
our
tax,
we
paid
more.
this
item
here
of
deficiency
of
federal
taxes,
$3
million
and
90,
is
due
in
part
to
the
fact
that
we
--
this
depreciation
was
treated
as
not
allowable.
so
that
instead
of
depreciation
being
in
our
favor,
in
which
trade
is
not
allowed,
our
taxes
went
up
and
this
became
a
credit.
in
fact
again
that's
where
schedule
one
is
misleading,
line
8,
that
everyone
had
so
much
trouble
finding
on
depreciation,
it's
odd
that's
the
only
thing
that's
not
mentioned
as
having
entered
in
the
computation
of
the
taxes.
now,
we
just
say
that
the
government
is
not
being
candid
in
the
use
of
schedule
1
as
to
what
took
place
here.
one
other
thing
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
we
certainly
do
your
honor,
we
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
alright
sir.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
no
sir.
your
honor,
in
fact
they
claim
item
10
as
net
payment
which
includes
up
there,
your
charter
hire
return,
all
of
those
words
are
wrong,
erroneous,
but
that
includes
that
above
charter
hire
return.
now
let
me
just
explain
this
though.
this
is
the
way
that
we
arrive
at
it
and
it
goes
back
to
mr.
justice
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
your
honor,
there
was
a
reduction
in
mortgage
indebtedness
in
the
amount
of
$20,554,468.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
now,
your
honor
though
if
you'll
look
at
the
record
in
the
agreement
entered
into
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
no
sir,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
because
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
but
your
honor,
the
computation
or
the
reduction
in
mortgage
indebtedness
took
into
consideration,
that
figure
was
arrived
at
after
taking
all
of
these
other
credits.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
well
let
me
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
we
received
during
the
war
$13
millions
of
charter
hire.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
that's
right
sir.
after
entering
into
this
agreement.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
by
which
it
stated
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
well
yes,
and
although
we
had
some
offsets
to
this
also.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
we
received
13
million
in
charter
hire
and
20
million
in
mortgage
adjustment,
yes
sir.
now,
the
difference
if
i
may
take
just
a
moment
in
the
effect
of
this
9(c)
1
which
was
a
condition
about
making
this
and
we
entered
into
an
agreement
in
which
9(c)
1
is
a
part
of
the
agreement.
to
get
back
to
the
examples
of
the
property
purchase,
a
building
for
a
$100,
this
is
an
agreement
not
between
two
taxpayers
but
between
the
taxing
authority,
the
government
and
a
taxpayer.
the
taxing
authority
is
the
only
one
then
get
back
and
save
what
depreciation
will
be
allowable,
what
will
not
be
treated
as
income,
what
will
be
treated
had
been
and
received
as
income?
i
and
another
taxpayer
cannot
agree
on
that,
but
the
government
can
and
the
government
entered
into
an
agreement
which
said,
“depreciation
and
amortization
allowed
or
allowable
with
respect
to
the
vessel
up
to
the
date
of
enactment
of
this
act
for
federal
tax
purposes
shall
be
treated
as
not
having
been
allowable.”
now
this
is
a
government,
not
two
taxpayers.
so
that
the
government
who
gives
us
depreciation
or
does
not
give
us
depreciation
said,
“alright,
we're
going
to
treat
it
as
if
you
haven't
had
it.”
that
brought
our
basis
back
up,
and
then
it
goes
on
down,
“amounts
credited”,
now
notice
this,
credited
not
returned.
credited
to
the
commission
including
charter
hire
shall
be
treated
for
federal
tax
purposes
as
not
having
been
received
or
accrued
as
income.
now
they
didn't
say
it
returned.
we
don't
return
it,
credited.
a
credit
that
enters
into
the
determination
of
the
price
adjustment
and
the
government
says,
“we're
going
to
treat
that
as
not
having
been
allowed.”
now
that
gives
tax
effects
in
42
through
46,
and
the
tax
effect
though
then
becomes
a
part
of
the
computation
of
the
adjustment
and
price
under
8.
now
therefore
we
say
that
this
is
not
the
case
of
where
we
buy
advertising.
in
fact,
if
we
made
a
contract
with
the
government
in
which
the
government
says,
“you
put
in
$10
of
advertising
and
we'll
count
it
is
part
of
the
capital
cost
then
we
could
do
it.”
the
government
can
agree
to
that
and
the
government
agreed
to
that
in
9(c)
1.
this
is
a
contract
between
a
taxpayer
and
a
government
who
has
this
taxing
authority
and
therefore,
we
say
that
the
tax
effects
are
limited
solely
to
those
years
recomputed.
and
then
though,
you
don't
divide
your
formula
on
the
9(b)
and
the
three
adjustments
that
mr.
bender
spoke
of.
nowhere
will
you
find,
look
at
the
regulation,
we
ask
you,
we've
set
them
out
in
our
brief.
the
regulation
promulgated
by
maritime.
if
you
look
at
the
sub-paragraphs,
when
they
have
the
credits
to
the
commission
and
the
credits
to
the
applicant,
each
one
of
them
is
stated
for
the
purposes
of
sub-paragraph
8
and
sub-paragraph
8
is
where
you
net
this.
now
that
is
one
place
where
the
government
is
correct
when
they
talk
about
net
in
line
10,
although
it's
not
net
payment,
but
it
is
net.
and
if
you
look
at
the
record
of
the
agreement
that
was
signed
by
these
parties,
you
will
find
there,
net
credit,
under
sub-paragraph
8
which
is
part
of
the
formula.
you
won't
find
anything
about
gross
price
adjustment.
you
will
find
that
we
asked
for
an
adjustment
and
we
still
maintain
that
we
are
entitled
then
to
all
items
that
--
in
that
make
up
that
computation
of
adjustment
and
by
9(c)
1,
these
tax
effects
mr.
bender
says
were
agreed
not
to
be
treated
as
such
tax
effect.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
well,
we
say
that
it
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
we
say
it's
one
adjustment,
your
honor
but
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
if
we
had
exchanged
checks
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
--
as
your
honor
says
and
say
there
hadn't
been
any
mortgage.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
-–
we
would
have
ended
up
with
checks
totaling
$20
million
more
than
the
checks
we
gave
to
the
government,
$20
million,
that's
the
net.
now
all
we
think
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
the
economic
effect
is
the
same
your
honor,
if
you
just
recall
that
we
are
asking
for
the
economic
effect
of
a
price
adjustment
regardless
of
the
individual
items
that
make
it
up.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
no
sir,
not
1,
2,
and
3,
we
would
not
have.
we
would
have
ended
up
as
i
stated,
we
may
have
given
them
a
check
of
$13,430,431.
they
would
have
given
us
the
check
for
a
million
495,
a
check
for
$2
million
and
686,
a
check
for
$430,000
and
if
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
now
well
--
your
honor,
you
didn't
let
me
explain
because
there's
additional
check
that
they
would
have
paid
us.
it's
not
here
and
that's
the
$11
million
which
you
would
get
under
sub-paragraph
1,
as
they
have
omitted
entirely
in
schedule
1,
we
would
have
gotten
another
$11
million
check.
now
that's
a
point
that
we
say
that
brings
us
down
and
we
would
not
have
gotten
$29
million,
net.
the
difference
would
have
not
been
$29
million,
but
we
would
have
had
another
$11
million
check
if
they
don't
recognize
here
and
it's
in
the
record.
if
your
honor
will
simply
refer
to
the
stipulation.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
depreciation?
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
we
don't
get
around
that
your
honor.
in
fact,
that's
a
way
we
base
our
computation
of
46
million
and
the
computation
of
the
taxes
are
based
on
that.
we
don't
say
that
it
did
have
that
fact.
in
fact,
we
recognized
that
effect.
it
was
put
in
here
for
this
very
purpose
to
keep
one
of
the
parties
from
coming
back
later
and
saying
you
didn't'
get.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
oh,
no
sir.
that's
not
depreciation
--
oh,
excuse
me
your
honor.
this
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
i'm
talking
to
the
--
if
the
--
it's
on
--
excuse
me
your
honor,
let
me
--
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
on
47,
that's
right.
so
now,
that's
under
sub-paragraph
1
of
your
computation.
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
depreciation,
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
make
that
clear.
this
$11
million
is
entirely
ignored
in
schedule
1
of
the
government,
but
that's
the
first
credit
to
which
we
were
entitled
and
it's
part
of
the
net
credits
under
sub-paragraph
8.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
yes
sir.
if
you
go
down
credit
on
page
47,
the
last
item
your
honor.
credits
in
favor
of
maritime,
charter
hire
credited
them
a
13
million.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
well,
it
reduce
as
11
million
but
when
you
add
the
2
million
interest,
the
1
million
charter
hire,
i'd
like
to
ask
the
government
where
we
got
depreciation
on
those
four
vessels,
they
treated
as
having
been
owed.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
that's
just
one
check.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
right.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
w.
mcconnell,
jr.
oh!
well,
i
was
answering
mr.
justice
white
about
individual
checks
for
each
credit.
that's
the
reason
i
said
i
wanted
a
check
for
$11
million,
$2
million,
$1
million
and
$430,000.
then
i'll
give
them
back
a
check
for
$13
million.
i
was
just
answering
his
point
that
if
we
gave
individual
checks
for
each
item
there,
but
the
net
is
as
shown
on
47
which
is
a
stipulation
of
the
parties
here.
and
in
conclusion,
we
give
effect
the
9(c)
1,
but
we
give
it
the
effect
desired
and
the
effect
that
congress
intended,
but
we
say
look
back
in
these
sub-paragraphs
and
look
for
one
adjustment
and
to
get
back
to
mr.
justice
white,
we
paid
$26
million
which
is
more
than
the
statutory
sales
price,
we're
not
asking
of
anything
except
what
the
government
gave
to
this
taxpayer
after
having
put
out
$50
million,
not
knowing
whether
it
ever
have
reduction,
they
pass
the
statute,
we're
simply
asking
for
the
benefits
which
congress
intended
to
give
this
taxpayer
to
put
out
some
money,
not
in
reliance
on
any
price
adjustment.
thank
you
gentlemen.
