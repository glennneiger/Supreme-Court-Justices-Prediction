justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
suppose
there's
something
about
only
the
small
number
of
military
that
is
of
the
total
military
stationed
in
texas
and
that
was
very
few
of
them
who've
done
what
your
client's
done.
that
is
to
take
up
residence,
i
take
it,
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
you
have
absentee
voting,
don't
you
as
for
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
well
all
of
those
who
were
stationed
outside
of
texas
proclaimed
texas
their
home,
they'd
still
vote,
the
absentee
ballot?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
that
many
more
than
we
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
hawaii
proportionately
has
many
more
military
than
we
do.0
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
(inaudible)
--
the
--
i
take
it
since
this
applies
only
to
those
who
have
made
texas
as
domicile
of
the
162
odd
thousands
stationed
there
at
any
one
time.
there
must
be
a
small
portion
of
those
who
would
make
texas
as
domicile,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
it
domicile
really
means
domicile,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
they've
given
up
whatever
that
may
have
been
their
place
of
abode
in
their
home
state
and
have
decided
that
henceforth
it
shall
be
texas.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
must
be
i
think
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
a
small
number
isn't
it
to
--
proportionate
at
least
of
162
odd
thousands
are
maybe
stationed
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
texas
with
all
its
appeal,
and
i
take
it
the
--
most
military
men
are
looking
forward
to
getting
out
and
go
back
home.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
retired
military
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
are
not
affected
by
this,
are
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
take
it
that
someone
entering
the
military
service
in
el
paso
moves
to
the
next
county
doing
military
service,
he's
not
qualified
to
vote.
he
shipped
overseas
and
he
can't
vote
absentee,
can't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
and
moves
to
another
county
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right,
in
texas
while
in
the
service.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
he
shipped
overseas,
he
can't
vote
as
absentee
either.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
a
little
inconsistency?
i
gather
that
you're
saying
being
career
service
people
or
people
with
long
tenure,
isn't
that
inconsistent
with
your
other
argument
that
tenure
is
usually
not
more
than
two
years.
they
don't
have
time
enough
to
get
used
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
that
66
--
i
get
your
point.
that
the
33
--
and
the
third
percent
may
not
be
clear
people
but
i'm
just
wondering
if
any
numbers
that
33
and
a
third
percent
wouldn't
be
substantially
greater
than
the
number
of
career
people,
that
is
a
two
year
draftees
or
stationed
in
texas
once
we
were
substantially
greater
in
number
than
the
number
of
career
service
people
stationed
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

(inaudible)
justice
william

of
an
income
tax
in
texas
on
domicile
areas?
