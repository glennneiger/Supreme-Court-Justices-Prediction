ms.
mary
k.
wall
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
discuss
first
the
question
which
mr.
justice
white
raised
from
the
bench
a
few
moments
ago
when
petitioner
was
presenting
his
argument
as
to
whether
the
texas
law
accords
a
different
treatment
to
members
of
the
military
who
entered
service
as
residence
of
the
state
of
texas
and
those
who
entered
as
residence
of
some
other
state.
now
there
has
been
some
other
passing
mentioned
of
that
in
subsequent
statements
of
counsel
but
i
want
to
be
sure
that
this
is
clearly
understood
because
it
was
in
petitioner's
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
there
was
some
confusion
in
his
presentation
i
believe
of
whether
that
was
an
issue
and
also
in
the
district
court's
opinion
in
the
case
of
mabry
versus
davis
which
i
--
all
of
the
members
of
the
court
may
now
be
aware
of
is
a
case
of
very
similar
nature
to
this
one
involving
essentially
the
same
matters
and
it
is
now
pending
on
a
--
in
a
jurisdictional
statement
for
appeal
in
that
case
has
been
filed
by
the
attorney
general.
the
district
court
for
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
texas
has
held
that
the
provision
in
the
texas
law
is
unconstitutional.
the
district
court
in
its
opinion,
clearly
assumed
both
in
its
opinion
and
in
its
judgment
assumed
that
the
texas
law
operates
differently
upon
people
who
enter
a
service
as
a
resident
of
some
other
state
and
those
who
enter
as
residents
of
the
state
of
texas.
now
the
provision
in
the
texas
constitution
is
that
a
person
in
military
service
may
vote
only
in
the
county
in
which
he
resided
so
long
had
--
as
he
continues
to
be
a
member
of
the
armed
forces.
now
this
operates
exactly
in
the
same
manner
upon
a
person
who
entered
as
a
resident
of
the
state
of
texas
and
person
who
entered
service
as
a
resident
of
some
other
state.
if
after
entering
service,
that
person
changes
his
legal
residence
to
some
place
other
than
the
place
where
he
had
his
legal
residence
at
the
time
he
entered
service.
the
effect
is
that
so
long
as
that
person
is
a
resident
of
the
state
of
texas,
he
cannot
vote
because
he
may
vote
only
in
the
county
where
he
resided
at
the
time
he
entered
service.
if
the
person
entered
service
as
a
resident
of
travis
county
and
is
now
stationed
in
el
paso
county
and
has
decided
that
he
is
going
to
claim
legal
residence
in
el
paso
county,
he
may
not
vote
in
texas
at
all.
if
a
per
--
if
--
that
is
exactly
the
same
effect
that
it
has
on
the
person
who
entered
as
a
resident
of
some
other
state
and
is
now
claiming
to
be
a
legal
resident
of
the
state
of
texas.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
in
every
state
in
the
union
including
texas,
including
alabama,
in
fact
every
state
in
the
union
without
qualification,
without
exception.
a
person
in
military
service
is
permitted
to
retain
his
legal
residence
in
the
state
and
in
the
place
where
he
lived
when
he
entered
service
as
long
as
he
continues
in
service
regardless
of
the
length
of
absence
whether
--
if
sergeant
carrington
had
never
set
forth
in
alabama
once
after
he
entered
service,
he
still
could
have
continued
to
claim
that
his
--
as
his
place
of
legal
residence
as
long
as
he
was
in
service.
that
is
the
universal
rule
throughout
the
united
states
and
all
of
the
states.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
well
now,
of
course
if
he
had
said
that
he
--
it
would
be
a
question
of
what
his
present
intent
was
if
he
was
saying
to
the
state
of
alabama,
"well,
i
no
longer
won't
be
a
resident
of
alabama,
i
want
to
be
a
resident
of
texas.
now,
i
am
claiming
to
be
a
resident
of
texas.
now,
i
am
a
resident
of
texas
but
they
won't
let
me
vote.
i
want
to
continue
to
vote
here".
no,
i
don't
believe
the
state
of
alabama
would
allow
him
to
do
that.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
but
now
if
he
had
said
to
his
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
of
course,
he
didn't
have
to
make
up
his
mind
that
he
wanted
to
become
a
resident
of
texas
now.
he
--
it
was
within
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
he
had
the
option.
he
had
the
option
to
decide,
“yes,
i
like
this
place.
i
want
to
live
here
when
i
retire
but
so
long
as
i'm
in
military
service,
i'm
not
going
to
claim,
it's
a
matter
of
intent.”
and
he
must
have
had
a
present
intent
to
make
it
--
to
claim
it
as
he
is
domicile
as
of
the
very
time.
now
he
could
intend
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
yes.
now
if
all
--
but
all
of
that
was
quickly
within
his
own
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
--
control
and
(inaudible).
ms.
mary
k.
wall
and
if
that
is
his
attitude
and
if
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
yes.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
that's
right.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
but
he
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
no.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
that's
right.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
he
could
not.
that
is
true.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
not
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
we
don't
allow
the
person
who
entered
service
as
a
resident
of
texas
to
vote
at
the
place
he
is
stationed
based
up
--
on
a
residence
acquired
during
military
service.
and
that
is
the
point
of
distinction.
he
votes
--
that
home
where
he
grew
up,
if
he
votes
at
all
in
texas,
he
votes
back
where
he
lived
before
he
entered
service.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
when
he
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
the
--
well
now
--
we
may
be
calling
into
question
the
very
principle
of
permitting
a
person
to
claim
residence
at
a
place
--well,
i
know
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
--
from
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
now
the
person
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
mr.
justice
harlan,
its
getting
at
the
very
same
--
the
person,
the
person
who
lived
there
when
he
entered
service
has
now
--
or
let
me
take
the
other
text,
the
person
who
acquires
--
who
claims
to
establish
residence
during
military
service.
now,
we
--
let
me
set
out
some
statistics
first.
a
person,
the
average
length
of
tenure
at
one
particular
duty
station
varies
from
--
a
permanent
duty
station
varies
from
average
of
two
to
four
years.
the
person
is
there
for
that
length
of
time
and
then
he
is
moved
somewhere
else.
he
--
our
contention
is
that
during
--
that
because
of
the
temporary
nature
of
his
sojourn
in
the
place
where
he
is
stationed,
he
cannot
have
the
same
opportunity
to
acquire
an
interest
in
community
affairs
to
become
assimilated
into
the
community
actually
to
learn
the
needs
and
necessities
of
the
community
to
become
familiar
with
the
local
government
in
the
manner
that
a
person
should
be
able
to
let
--
in
the
manner
that
a
person
should
in
order
to
be
able
to
vote
there
that
because
of
the
nature
of
his
military
service
which
may
take
him
away
from
there
at
any
moment.
and
at
the
most,
is
likely
to
keep
him
there
only
for
a
limited
time
that
he
does
not
become
in
fact
a
member
of
the
community
to
entitle
him
to
vote
there.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
now
i
--
it
--
i
think
that
(inaudible)
--
you
--
that
question
would
be
getting
to
the
proposition
that
a
person
must
be
--
although
he
is
admittedly
a
permanent
resident
of
the
place
that
he
must
be
shown
to
have
some
kind
of
overwhelming
interest
in
the
community
before
he
is
going
to
be
entitled
to
vote.
now
if
that
--
if
--
i
think
that
that
proposition
gets
somewhat
beyond
our
--
the
question
in
this
present
case.
now
our
contention
is
that
the
people
in
military
service
because
of
the
nature
of
their
service,
the
fact
that
they
are
at
the
most
temporary
residents
at
the
place
where
they
are
stationed,
that
as
a
class,
that
is
a
characteristic
that
differentiates
them
from
any
other
class
of
citizens
--
of
resident
and
for
that
reason,
that
they
are
entit
--
that
the
state
may
treat
them
separately
as
a
class
subject
to
this
common
characteristic.
now
the
fact
that
there
may
be
individual
members
of
the
class
that
don't
fit
the
pattern,
as
sergeant
carrington
for
example,
it
is
our
contention
that
he
doesn't
fit
the
pattern
of
the
typical
man
in
military
service.
and
incidentally,
there's
--
there
are
some
statistics,
i
believe
that
mr.
justice
brennan
raised
the
question
that,
“would
there
only
be
a
small
number
of
people
who
would
want
to
claim
residence
in
the
state
of
texas?”
now
there
are
66%.
the
statistics
we
have
on
that
is
that
66%
of
the
people
in
the
fourth
army
command
which
embraces
five
states
including
state
of
texas
are
career
servicemen.
we
don't
have
any
statistics
on
the
other
three
services
but
the
conjecture
seems
to
be
supportable
that
the
percentage
of
career
of
servicemen
in
the
other
services
would
run
as
high
or
higher.
now
those
66%
are
the
people
who
have
pulled
up
roots
back
where
they
grew
up,
where
they
entered
service,
where
they
would
be
entitled
to
claim
residence
if
they
wanted
to.
they
are
the
people
who
are
likely
to
want
to
claim
a
residence
wherever
they
happened
to
be
stationed.
there
are
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
no,
i'm
--
i
am
speaking
of
the
length
of
time
spent
in
military
service
and
not
that
spent
at
a
particular
duty
station.
now,
i
said
that
the
length
of
--
that
a
person
remained
at
a
particular
duty
station
is
of
limited
duration,
two
to
four
years.
now
--
but
the
career
person
will
be
in
service
for
a
long
time.
he
has
no
particular
reason
to
want
to
continue
to
claim
residence
at
the
place
where
he
entered
service.
now,
the
other
33%
are
a
lesser
percent
for
some
branches
of
the
service,
yes.
they're
in
the
service
because
they
have
to
be
there,
they
have
to
fulfill
a
certain
compulsory
requirement,
all
they're
thinking
that
is
getting
out
and
going
back
home,
they
aren't
the
ones
who
are
going
to
want
this
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
if
during
the
first
year
of
his
service
he
decided
that
he
was
going
to
stay
permanently
in
el
paso,
that
would
be
the
effect
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
well
of
course,
i
believe
he
has
been
in
service
for
about
18
or
19
years
already.
now
he's
just
about
out.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
he
wouldn't
have
long
to
wait
now.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
that
--
he
could
be
prevented
from
voting
if
he
--
that
is
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
--
correct
that
if
he
say
--
if
he
said,
"i
don't
but
yes,
i
know
what
i'm
getting
into.
i
know
that
i'm
not
going
to
be
able
to
vote
but
i
just
don't
want
it
even
stated
on
my
record
anywhere
that
i
am
still
a
resident
of
alabama.
i
don't
want
to
vote
there.”
that
would
be
the
effect.
that
is
correct.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
not
according
to
the
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
--
information
we
got
from
the
fourth
army.
those
were
their
figures.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
were
--
i
don't
believe
that
that
should
tax
our
credulity
because
we
hear
talk
of
the
possibility
of
ending
the
draft.
in
fact
there
is
a
study
going
on
right
now
as
to
whether
it
is
feasible
to
end
the
draft.
and
that
would
be
on
the
--
in
the
belief
that
there
would
be
enough
people
voluntarily
entering
service
and
most
of
them
would
be
entering
with
the
purpose
of
making
it
a
career.
now
i
--
the
--
coming
back
though
to
--
to
make
a
point
briefly,
it
is
our
contention
that
a
person
so
long
as
he
is
in
military
service
and
subject
to
being
transferred
at
any
time
by
a
military
order
which
he
cannot
resist,
that
he
at
the
most
is
a
mere
soldier
in
the
place
where
he
is
living,
where
he
is
stationed.
now
it
is
our
contention
that
a
state
could
withhold
from
him
the
privilege
of
acquiring
residence
for
any
purpose.
now
the
law
of
texas
permits
a
serviceman
to
acquire
residence
for
all
purposes
except
voting.
it
merely
says
to
him
--
it
says,
“yes,
we
recognize
you
as
a
resident
for
all
other
purposes
but
we
are
not
going
to
allow
you
to
vote
if
you
do
establish
your
resident
during
military
service.”
now
it
is
our
contention
that
he
could
--
that
the
privilege
of
establishing
residence
for
any
purpose
could
be
withheld
from
a
person
in
military
service
so
long
as
he
continues
in
service
because
he
is
in
fact
merely
temporarily
within
the
state.
it's
not
within
his
choice
to
remain
no
matter
how
much
he
might
wish
to
remain.
it
is
not
his
choice.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
well
now
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
that
was
in
connection
with
the
right
to
vote
in
a
congressional
race
was
it
not?
and
of
course
what
the
court
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
but
--
and
the
cons
--
and
it
was
constitutionally
secured
because
of
the
fact
that
the
state
--
what
--
i've
forgotten
it
was
that
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
a
louisiana
case.
it
was
constitutionally
secured
because
the
state
of
louisiana
had
conferred
the
privilege
of
suffrage
bond
this
individual
and
recognized
him
as
a
qualified
elector
of
the
state.
then
by
virtue
of
the
--
of
article
i
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
he
was
entitled
to
vote
for
a
congressman
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
was
a
qualified
elector
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
he
had
a
constitutionally
secured
right
to
vote
for
a
congressman
flowing
from
the
fact
that
he
was
a
qualified
elector
in
the
state
of
louisiana,
but
i
don't
recall
that
the
case
would
have
intimated
that
--
or
that
the
case
reached
the
power
of
the
state
to
prescribe
the
qualification.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
by
his
own
volition
and
we
must
always
remember
that.
that
unlike
other
--
there
are
only
a
limited
number
of
classes
of
individuals
who
have
this
choice
of
saying,
“i
maintain
my
residence
back
there
or
i
establish
my
residence
here.”
people
in
military
service
in
most
states,
people
in
government
employment,
any
form
of
government
employment,
students
usually
have
that
option.
the
average
civilian
does
not
have
that
option.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
and
here
is
something
else.
now
as
to
the
number
of
persons
whether
there
would
be
a
--
and
a
substantial
number
of
persons
claiming
residence
that
is
military
personnel
claiming
residence
in
the
state
of
texas.
the
state
of
texas
does
not
have
state
income
tax.
and
i
know
just
from
the
correspondence
that
crosses
my
desk
in
the
attorney
general's
office
that
that
is
a
very
strong
inducement
to
people
in
military
service
to
want
to
claim
residence
in
the
state
of
texas
while
they
are
stationed
there
and
after
they
have
been
transferred
somewhere
else
under
this
privilege
that
the
texas
law
gives
them
once
having
established
residence
that
they
can
continue
to
maintain
residence,
and
that
would
apply
to
the
person
in
military
service
having
residence
established
while
in
service
although
he
couldn't
vote.
he
could
continue
to
maintain
his
legal
residence
and
that
is
a
very
strong
inducement
to
people
in
military
service
to
want
to
establish
residence
in
the
state
of
texas.
ms.
mary

well,
now,
i
didn't
want
to

i
purposely
avoided

i
didn't

give
the
impression
the

i
didn't

ms.
mary

i
beg
your
pardon.
ms.
mary

for
--
ms.
mary

for
voting?
ms.
mary
k.
wall
for
voting,
well
there
must
--
of
course
over
21,
a
citizen,
residence
in
the
state
for
a
year
and
in
the
county
for
six
months,
and
not
subject
to
disqualifications
of
conviction
of
a
felony,
lunacy.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
just
this
restriction
on
place
of
voting
that
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
yes.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
yes,
yes.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
now
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
all
--
the
rest
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
all
the
residence
requires
is
to
establish
that
these
conditions
that
the
person
no
longer
intends
to
go
back
--
to
return
to
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
--
the
place
where
he
did
have
residence.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
he
no
longer
intends
to
return
there.
he
has
abandoned
that
as
the
place
he
calls
home.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
and
that
he
intends
to
remain
where
he
is
at
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
--
the
present
time
--
ms.
mary
k.

--
if
he
has
no
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
well,
that
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
now,
when
i
say
in
--
and
when
we
say
indefinitely,
we
don't
mean
that
he
intends
to
come
back
there
if
he
were
called
away
that
he
would
come
back
there.
it's
just
that
he
has
no
particular
intention
to
go
anywhere
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
--
else
immediately.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
well,
that
is
the
law
of
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
--
domicile
in
our
state.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
and
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
well,
now
when
we
--
i'm
using
the
term
residence
is
--
being
used
in
the
sense
of
legal
residence
interchangeable
with
domicile
when
i
say
it
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
--
for
six
months
(voice

--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
that's
right.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
that's
right.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
that's
right.
now
every
state
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
now,
your
honor,
we
are
not.
the
fact
of
residence
has
been
admitted,
not
disputed
whether
sergeant
carrington
actually
felt
there
was
no
proof.
the
allegations
were
accepted
because
the
state
of
texas
had
no
reason
to
want
to
say
to
sergeant
carrington,
“you
must
prove
this.
we
doubt
your
word.”
this
is
what
we
frankly
would
term
a
test
case.
undoubtedly
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
there
were
allegations
that
were
not
disputed.
now
every
state
in
the
united
states
requires
a
certain
length
of
residence
before
a
person
may
vote.
the
length
of
residence
in
some
states,
in
most
states
is
one
year.
in
some
states
it
is
two
years.
now
those
requirements
have
been
held
to
be
constitutional
that
at
least
--
except,
i
believe
there
has
not
been
an
adjudication
as
to
those
requirements
with
respect
to
voting
for
in
the
presidential
election
and
there
is
a
case
now
before
the
court
in
which
that
questions
is
being
presented.
now
the
theory
on
which
those
states
--
the
theory
on
which
states
may
withhold
for
a
time
the
privilege
of
voting
is
because
the
person
until
he
has
been
in
the
state
at
certain
length
of
time
has
not
become
assimilated
into
the
community.
the
exactly
we
say
that
the
same
reasoning
supports
--
would
support
withholding
the
privilege
of
voting
from
persons
in
military
service
because
no
matter
--
even
though
they
have
been
within
the
state
for
that
length
of
time
and
for
some
period
in
excess
of
that,
that
because
they
are
subject
to
being
transferred
to
other
places
without
any
volition
on
their
part
to
remain
that
they
never
in
fact
become
members
of
the
community
while
they
are
in
the
military
service.
now,
i
won't
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
yes,
yes.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
oh,
you
were
speaking
about
into
the
area
of
federal
and
not
general
residence
requirements.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
yes,
yes,
that
is
true
that
that
could
be
done.
i
won't
--
there
is
just
one
point
that
--
my
time
is
about
to
run
out.
i
want
to
emphasize
and
this
is
covered
in
our
brief.
and
i'm
sorry
that
i
can't
devote
more
time
to
it
in
the
oral
argument.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
petitioner
is
not
typical
of
persons
in
military
service
generally.
we
contend
that
even
as
to
petitioner,
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
withholding
voting
privileges
from
him.
but
as
to
the
class
as
a
whole,
we
say
that
petitioner
is
not
typical
and
the
fact
that
a
few
inequalities
may
exist
because
of
a
classification
which
basically
is
sound
does
not
render
it
invalid
as
to
the
isolated
examples
of
who
are
not
typical
of
the
general
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
there
are
60
per
--
66%
or
more
of
persons
in
military
service
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
--
stationed
within
the
state
of
texas
who
are
potential
residents
of
the
state
who,
if
they
wish
to
do
so
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
--
under
the
option
that
the
law
of
every
state
gives
them.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
if
they
wish
to
do
so,
they
could
claim
to
be
residents
of
the
state
of
texas
because
they
could
or
there
are
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
no,
the
difference
is
this.
the
thing
that
sets
the
sergeant
apart
is
that
he
says,
“i
intend
to
remain
in
texas
permanently.”
ms.
mary
k.
wall
that
would
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
but
all
he
(voice

--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
no,
no,
the
sergeant
says,
“i
am
going
to
make
texas
my
home
now
and
after
i
retire.
i'm
going
to
continue
to
live
here.
my
family
is
going
to
live
here.”
now,
all
that
person
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
that
would
be
all
that
would
be
necessary.
ms.
mary
k.
wall
he
can
assert
his
intention
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
--
but
of
course
that
is
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
of
course
our
problem
is
with
those
who
do
establish
a
domicile
and
that
is
the
very
point
of
the
restriction
because
the
state
--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
--
has
felt
that
it
was
(voice

--
ms.
mary
k.
wall
is
that
an
invitation
to
elaborate
or
--
my
time
is
up.
i
don't
want
to
