justice
potter
stewart
you
say
he
had
the
choice,
was
that
his
only
choice,
those
two
alternatives?
was
that
the
choice
that
the
army
gave
him
or
what
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
how
far
from
his
--
from
white
sands
is
his
present
residence?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
the
brief
said
he
was
carrying
on
a
business
in
white
sands
which
he
has
now
--
has
moved
to
el
paso.
what
kind
of
a
business
is
that?
justice
potter
stewart
or
for
as
long
as
about
a
year
or
six
months.
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
if
the
states
were
to
prove
that?
justice
potter
stewart
so
far
as
intent
is
concern
as
my
brother
clark
asked
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
has
not
--
does
he
have
to
say,
“i
have
no
intention
of
departing?”
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
no
present
intention
of
departing.
justice
potter
stewart
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
he
has
to
change
his
domicile,
his
home.
justice
potter
stewart
the
order
around
physically
to
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
his
body
in
--
any
place
that
the
army
tells
him
to
be.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
where
his
home
is
depends
upon
his
--
ultimately
upon
his
own
state
of
mind.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it,
i'm
sure
you
don't
have
the
statistics
to
fully
know
where
to
get
them.
but
of
those
39,000
people,
a
very
tiny
percentage
would
consider
(inaudible)
or
the
--
it's
in
environ
as
their
home
and
--
or
qualify
under
your
general
election
statutes
in
texas
as
i've
understand
them,
i've
just
been
reading
this
case
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
maby
--
mabry
against
davis
where
the
general
election
laws
are
described
in
the
court's
opinion,
i
suppose
there's
a
record
of
it.
you
told
that
six
months
in
the
county
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
one
year
in
the
state
and
plus
a
subjective
intention
that
this
be
my
home,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
to
be
proved
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
(voice

declarations
of
--
by
external
circumstances.
justice
potter
stewart
no
--
justice
potter
stewart
residence
does
require
more
than
mere
physical
presence
for
six
months
and
a
year,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
anywhere
else.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
indefinitely.
justice
potter
stewart
indefinitely.
justice
potter
stewart
his
present
intention
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
to
remain
there
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
or
would
be
anywhere
else
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
at
the
moment.
so
it's
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
very
close
to
domicile
which
says
--
the
law
tells
that.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
the
residence
--
you
require
domicile
plus
his
six
months
in
the
county
and
the
(inaudible)
--
in
the
county
and
a
year
in
the
state.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
you
can
require
domicile
in
five
minutes.
justice
potter
stewart
you
were
--
you
required
domicile
plus
this
time
requirement
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
isn't
that
right?
