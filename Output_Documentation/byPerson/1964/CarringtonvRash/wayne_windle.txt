mr.
wayne
windle
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
wayne
windle
--
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
here
representing
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
sergeant
carrington.
we
initiated
this
case
by
filing
a
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus
in
the
texas
supreme
court.
the
petition
was
denied
in
a
7-to-2
split
decision
and
then
this
court
granted
our
petition
for
certiorari.
the
case
involves
voting
rights
of
servicemen
residing
in
texas.
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
texas
contains
a
provision
which
prevents
all
servicemen
from
acquiring
a
voting
residence
in
texas
so
long
as
they
remain
in
the
service.
if
a
serviceman
while
in
the
service
moves
into
a
new
county
in
texas
even
if
that
new
county
becomes
his
bona
fide
residence,
he
will
never
be
allowed
to
vote
in
that
county
so
long
as
he
remains
in
the
military
service.
mr.
wayne
windle
if
he
is
a
texas
resident
and
has
in
fact
changed
from
his
original
resident,
he
cannot
vote
there.
so
it
really
matters
not
whether
he
originally
resided
in
texas
or
resided
outside
of
texas.
once
he
intends
to
acquire
a
new
home,
he
loses
his
right
to
vote
in
whatever
county
he
came
from.
mr.
wayne
windle
the
provision
is
article
vi,
section
2,
and
in
it
effect
--
in
effect
reads
like
this,
“any
member
of
the
military
service
may
vote
only
in
the
county
in
which
he
resided
at
the
time
of
entering
the
service”.
the
question
of
course
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not,
this
particular
provision
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
is
our
contention
that
it
does
and
the
respondent
--
that
respondent
carr
contends
that
it
does
not.
the
facts
of
the
--
this
particular
case
as
they
relate
to
sergeant
carrington
are
these,
he
is
in
the
united
states
army
and
entered
the
service
in
1946.
at
that
time,
he
resided
in
jefferson
county,
alabama.
in
1962,
he
was
stationed
at
white
sands,
new
mexico
which
is
very
near
el
paso
county.
in
february
of
1962,
he
had
the
choice
of
either
residing
in
new
mexico
or
el
paso
county.
he
and
his
family
chose
to
reside
in
el
paso
county
simply
because
they
like
the
city
of
el
paso
and
wanted
to
make
it
their
home.
mr.
wayne
windle
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
he
had
to
live
somewhere
near
enough
to
white
sands
that
he
could
work
there.
mr.
wayne
windle
and
as
a
practical
matter,
he
would
be
limited
to
new
mexico
or
el
paso
county.
mr.
wayne
windle
i
think
it's
approximately
60
miles.
mr.
wayne
windle
that's
correct.
and
just
like
many
civilians,
he
comes
home
at
4:30
in
the
evening,
takes
off
his
uniform,
and
can
participate
in
community
affairs.
there's
no
question
in
this
case
but
what
he
did,
become
a
bona
fide
resident
of
el
paso
county.
he
in
fact
purchased
a
business,
his
children
attend
the
public
schools
and
that
sort
of
thing.
so
it
is
admit
--
mr.
wayne
windle
it
was
a
half
hour
recording
--
repair
business.
he
purchased
the
machinery
and
equipment
from
i
believe
las
cruces,
new
mexico
and
transferred
it
to
el
paso
county
and
he's
presently
still
operating
it
with
a
partner,
in
fact
another
serviceman.
in
december
of
1963,
he
paid
his
poll
tax.
and
then
in
march
of
1964,
he
contacted
me
and
i
wrote
a
letter
to
the
republican
county
chairman,
asking
the
chairman
if
sergeant
carrington
would
be
allowed
to
vote
in
the
republican
county
primary.
and
he
replied,
“of
course
no,
that
he
could
not
because
under
the
texas
constitution,
he
may
vote
only
in
the
county
in
which
he
resided
at
the
time
of
entering
the
service".
now
as
a
practical
matter,
he
could
not
vote
there.
this
county
was
jefferson
county,
alabama.
he
could
not
vote
there
because
he
had
designated
el
paso
county
as
his
home
and
in
fact,
it
was
his
home
for
all
purposes.
mr.
wayne
windle
so
he
could
not
meet
the
residence
requirements
of
jefferson
county,
alabama
or
any
other
county.
so
he
was
left
without
a
place
to
vote.
and
he
will
not
be
allowed
to
vote
in
any
local
state
or
national
election
so
long
as
this
law
remains
on
the
books
and
so
long
as
he
remains
in
the
military
service.
mr.
wayne
windle
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
windle
prior
to
that
time,
members
of
the
military
had
been
absolutely
prohibited
from
voting
by
a
provision
which
classed
him
with
convicted
felons,
lunatics,
minors,
and
others
who
were
obviously
unqualified
to
vote.
in
1954,
they
were
eliminated
from
that
classification
and
this
particular
provision
was
added.
mr.
wayne
windle
well
sir,
no.
[laughter]
mr.
wayne
windle
your
honor,
i
have
not.
i
do
know
that
in
the
case
of
mabry
against
davis,
there
was
a
member
of
the
service
who
was
supposedly
qualified
to
know
whether
or
not
other
states
had
similar
laws.
and
it
was
stipulated
that
he
would
testify
that
texas
was
the
only
state.
now,
the
respondents
have
pointed
out
in
their
brief
that
there
are
--
i
think
three
or
four
other
states
that
have
similar
provisions.
my
research
was
limited
but
from
what
i
can
tell,
the
prohibitions
that
appear
on
some
of
the
other
--
in
some
of
the
other
states
don't
have
the
same
effect
as
this
one.
the
effect
of
the
other
provisions
is
that
they
state
that
a
member
of
the
military
cannot
apply
a
voting
residence
simply
by
being
stationed
there.
of
course,
we
will
agree
with
this
more
must
be
shown.
the
serviceman
must
show
that
he
is
a
bona
fide
resident
of
the
particular
county.
mr.
wayne
windle
that's
correct.
the
same
requirement
that
is
imposed
upon
all
citizens
regardless
of
occupation,
if
that
is
six
months
or
a
year,
fine.
mr.
wayne
windle
yes,
he
does.
not
under
the
statute
but
under
the
election
laws
of
texas,
he
must
prove
to
either
the
tax
collector
or
to
the
election
judge
that
sits
at
the
polling
place
that
he
is
a
bona
fide
resident.
and
if
he
falsified
his
statement,
he
is
subject
to
felony
convictions
--
mr.
wayne
windle
it
takes
--
mr.
wayne
windle
as
far
as
intent
is
concerned
--
mr.
wayne
windle
well,
the
election
judge
--
mr.
wayne
windle
--
has
the
power
to
ask
all
of
the
questions
that
he
wants
to
of
the
voter
and
the
man
must
sign
a
statement
that
he
does
in
fact
intend
for
that
to
be
his
home
and
swear
to
it.
and
then
if
he
is
further
--
mr.
wayne
windle
no,
it
does
not.
but
then
of
course,
many
civilians
know
that
they're
not
permanently
residents
of
a
particular
county.
all
he
must
show
is
that
while
he
is
there,
he
intends
for
that
to
be
his
home.
mr.
wayne
windle
no.
mr.
wayne
windle
no,
he
does
not
but
neither
though
any
of
the
civilian
voters.
for
example,
members
of
college
faculties
often
know
that
they're
going
to
be
located
in
a
particular
area
for
a
limited
number
of
years.
but
if
they
intend
for
that
county
to
be
their
home
while
they
are
there,
then
they
would
be
allowed
to
vote.
and
of
course
our
contention
is
that
a
man
in
the
service
should
have
the
same
opportunity
to
prove
his
residence
as
all
of
the
other
civilian
voters
in
the
county.
mr.
wayne
windle
fourteenth
amendment,
the
equal
protection
clause
--
mr.
wayne
windle
yes
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
windle
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
that
the
classification
is
unreasonable
and
amounts
to
discrimination
against
servicemen.
one
of
the
primary
contingence
of
the
respondent
and
the
respondent
takes
the
position
that
the
classification
is
reasonable,
and
that
there
are
real
and
substantial
differences
between
servicemen
and
civilians.
our
position
is
that
very
definitely
there
are
certain
unique
characteristics
of
the
military
profession.
but
then
their
unique
characteristics
of
all
professions
which
distinguish
them
from
all
others,
we
do
not
feel
that
the
differences
are
sufficient
to
restrict
the
serviceman's
voting
rights.
now
one
primary
difference
which
respondent
carr
emphasizes
in
his
brief
is
that
members
of
the
military
service
are
very
often
only
temporary
residents
of
a
particular
county.
and
of
course
this
is
true.
many
of
them
are
there
for
a
limited
number
of
years.
but
we
do
not
feel
that
this
alone
is
a
sufficient
difference
from
other
citizens
to
discriminate
only
against
the
servicemen.
as
i
mentioned,
members
of
college
faculties
were
there
temporarily,
also,
employees
of
large
national
corporations,
perhaps
insurance
executives
might
be
located
in
a
particular
area
for
a
limited
number
of
years.
mr.
wayne
windle
construction
workers
and
numerous
other
groups
are
very
often
in
an
area
for
a
limited
number
of
years.
mr.
wayne
windle
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
correct.
we
do
say
that
there
are
a
substantial
number
who
--
if
given
the
opportunity
can
prove
that
they're
bona
fide
residents.
for
example,
some
men
have
invested
$25,000
or
$30,000
in
their
home
and
maybe
in
other
private
enterprise
within
the
community.
some
of
them
are
very
active
in
community
and
civil
affairs.
some
of
them
will
swear
that
if
they
are
transferred
somewhere
else,
they
would
leave
their
family
there
and
that
they
would
return
as
soon
as
possible
and
that
they
in
fact
intend
to
retire
there.
and
there
should
be
no
question
but
what
these
men
are
entitled
to
vote
there,
if
they
can
prove
that
they
intend
for
that
to
be
their
home.
mr.
wayne
windle
namely,
you
mean
between
those
who
at
least
entered
the
service
there
in
texas
and
those
who
entered
elsewhere?
mr.
wayne
windle
well,
i
made
this
contention
before
the
texas
supreme
court
and
learned
that
it
was
erroneous
because
i
now
understand
that
there
is
no
distinction.
that
the
one
who
resided
there,
when
he
entered
the
service,
cannot
vote
in
that
county
if
he
has
in
fact
become
a
bona
fide
resident
of
another
county.
mr.
wayne
windle
this
is
true
unless
he
--
mr.
wayne
windle
your
honor,
this
is
true
unless
he
intends
for
that
new
county
to
be
his
home.
in
other
words,
once
he
establishes
a
new
home
in
the
county
where
he
is
stationed
--
mr.
wayne
windle
--
he
loses
--
mr.
wayne
windle
that
is
correct.
mr.
wayne
windle
well,
that's
correct
unless
--
mr.
wayne
windle
--
unless
they
intended
to
move
into
that
enjoined
--
mr.
wayne
windle
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
windle
this
is
correct.
this
is
correct
--
mr.
wayne
windle
we
do,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
wayne
windle
well,
of
course
this
is
true
unless
they
have
acquired
a
new
--
mr.
wayne
windle
--
home
elsewhere.
and
of
course
that's
the
problem
we
have
in
our
case.
all
of
the
servicemen
with
which
we
are
concerned
are
servicemen
who
intend
to
acquire
a
new
residence
but
they
cannot
do
it
for
voting
purposes
solely
because
they're
members
of
the
military
service.
mr.
wayne
windle
no
your
honor,
i
would
think
not
primarily
for
this
reason.
there
seems
to
me
to
be
a
very
large
distinction
when
you're
dealing
with
voting
rights
in
one
case
where
you're
actually
extending
the
privilege
further
and
in
other
case
like
ours,
you're
denying
them.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
complain
if
you
were
in
effect
by
legislation
extending
suffrage
rights
but
there
seems
to
be
a
very
big
difference
when
you're
in
fact
restricting
them
or
denying
them
as
they
are
in
this
case.
in
summary,
let
me
point
this
out.
the
court
well
knows
that
in
this
country,
voting
rights
are
basic
and
essential.
the
court
has
recently
so
stated
in
the
apportionment
cases.
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
his
state
of
the
union
message
said,
“i
propose
we
eliminate
all
remaining
obstacles
to
the
right
to
vote”.
i
mentioned
this
simply
to
show
that
we're
living
in
a
time
when
voting
rights
are
being
expanded
and
not
restricted.
and
because
this
case
involves
voting
rights,
it
is
our
position
that
the
respondents
must
show
that
some
overwhelming
public
interest
will
be
served
by
this
restriction.
we
feel
that
the
respondents
must
show
that
this
particular
restriction
promotes
the
public
welfare
to
some
extent.
and
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
state
of
texas
has
not
and
cannot
present
any
valid
reason
for
restricting
the
serviceman's
right
to
vote.
thank
you.
mr.
wayne
windle
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
try
to
make
my
remarks
as
brief
as
possible.
in
my
opening
statement,
i
did
mention
that
i
felt
that
the
state
of
texas
must
show
that
some
public
interest
would
be
served
by
this
provision.
let
me
just
very
briefly
examine
some
of
the
reasons
that
respondent
carr
says
justifies
this
particular
voting
restriction.
i
think
the
main
contention
is
that
if
the
servicemen
were
allowed
to
vote,
they
might
constitute
a
majority
in
some
particular
county.
and
then
they
would
exercise
complete
dominion
and
control
over
the
local
politics.
first
of
all,
let
me
say
that
i
agree
with
the
three
judges
in
the
mabry
case.
i
don't
believe
there
is
such
an
area
where
the
balance
of
power
would
be
altered
by
abolishing
this
provision.
but
even
if
there
was
an
area
where
the
servicemen
would
be
a
majority
and
would
exercise
a
complete
control
over
the
local
politics,
they
have
a
right
to
do
so.
if
the
majority
happened
to
be
members
of
labor
unions
in
a
particular
county,
they
can
control
the
politics.
mr.
wayne
windle
that's
correct.
i
think
there
are
no
areas
--
mr.
wayne
windle
no
sir,
it
surely
is
not.
another
argument
advanced
by
the
respondent
carr
is
that
a
commanding
officer
might
control
the
politics
himself
through
pressure
and
persuasion
on
his
men.
well
first
of
all,
the
federal
law
prohibits
any
military
officer
from
influencing
votes
of
the
men
under
his
command.
secondly,
we
do
have
secret
elections
in
texas.
we
vote
by
secret
ballot
and
any
pressure
or
persuasion
that
the
commanding
officer
might
put
on
one
of
his
men,
could
not
be
so
coercive
if
that
man
would
be
prevented
from
voting
his
own
convictions.
but
once
he
entered
the
voting
booth
or
began
marking
his
secret
ballot.
so
we
do
not
believe
that
here
is
any
threat
that
a
commanding
officer
himself
could
control
the
elections.
so
we
feel
that
those
arguments
(voice
overlap)
mr.
wayne
windle
(inaudible)
that
was
one
of
the
things
mentioned
in
there.
mr.
wayne
windle
if
those
men
were
qualified
voters
while
they
were
there,
they
have
the
right
to
do
that.
if
they
were
not,
of
course
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
vote.
but
the
same
thing
can
happen
of
course
in
a
civilian
community.
one
of
the
arguments
asserted
is
that
servicemen
might
like
a
proper
concern
for
the
best
interest
of
the
community.
well,
of
course
this
can
be
set
of
any
group.
the
problem
is
what
group
of
people
can
say
that
another
group
lacks
the
proper
concern
for
the
best
interest
of
the
community.
the
majority
of
the
qualified
voters
are
the
ones
that
should
determine
what
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
community.
one
argument
presented
was
that
the
petitioner
is
not
typical,
that
person
is
in
the
military
service.
we
say
that
if
given
the
opportunity,
there
are
other
servicemen
like
petitioner
who
can
prove
that
they're
bona
fide
residents.
another
argument
was
that
the
classification
is
not
invalid
because
it
results
in
some
inequities.
in
this
connection,
respondent,
carr
mentioned
that
the
wife
can
vote
whereas
the
serviceman
cannot.
and
he
mentioned
that
this
was
possibly
an
over
cite.
and
i
got
the
distinct
idea
that
if
the
state
so
decided
they
could
also
restrict
her
right
to
vote.
and
let
me
submit
this
to
the
court,
which
group
will
be
next
if
this
voting
provision
is
allowed
to
stand
for
the
reasons
asserted
by
the
respondent?
which
group
will
the
state
of
texas
or
some
other
state
find
where
the
members
--
where
some
of
the
members
aren't
bona
fide
residents?
which
group
would
texas
or
some
other
state
find
where
the
members
might
be
influenced
by
somebody
in
a
position
of
authority
or
where
there
are
cohesion
among
members
of
the
group,
or
where
the
group,
if
allowed
to
vote,
might
constitute
a
majority.
and
of
course
--
then
there
are
other
reasons.
we
submit
to
the
court
if
this
particular
provision
for
voting
restriction
is
allowed
to
stand
for
the
reasons
asserted
by
respondent
carr,
then
there
can
be
and
would
probably
be
other
denials
of
the
right
to
vote.
therefore
we
request
the
court
to
declare
this
one
unconstitutional.
thank
you.
