mr.
hawthorne
phillips
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
phillips.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
petitioner
in
this
case
is
a
member
of
the
armed
services
and
contends
that
article
vi,
section
2
of
the
texas
constitution
violates
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
don't
agree
with
this
contention.
i
wish
to
discuss
three
basic
questions
that
have
arisen
in
this
case.
first,
can
a
state
pass
any
laws
discriminating
against
the
particular
class
of
individuals
which
i
think
is
fairly
elementary,
this
court
has
decided
that
issue
so
many
times.
second,
if
the
state
can
pass
discriminatory
laws
where
there
are
any
constitutional
innovations
that
would
restrict
the
states
on
the
term
--
on
determining
the
qualifications
and
rules
for
voting.
and
third,
there's
the
constitution
of
texas,
article
vi,
section
2
arbitrarily
and
invidiously
discriminate
against
members
of
the
armed
forces
by
providing
that
they
may
vote
only
in
the
county
in
which
they
resided
at
the
time
of
their
entry
into
the
military
service.
or
if
you
state
it
another
way,
as
a
prohibition
of
the
members
of
the
military
service
from
acquiring
residence
for
voting
in
texas
during
the
period
of
their
service,
constitute
arbitrary
and
invidious
discrimination.
now
this
case
on
the
question
of
the
right
of
this
court
on
--
question
of
the
right
of
a
state
to
discriminate
has
discussed
that
many
times.
i
think
the
last
time
in
the
case
of
mclaughlin
versus
state
of
florida
in
which
you've
listed
quite
a
number
of
cases
giving
rights
of
discrimination
in
particular
instance.
and
in
the
second
question
presented,
this
court
also
on
many
occasions
has
held
that
the
united
states
constitution
makes
voter's
qualifications
rest
on
state
laws
even
in
federal
elections.
speaking
of
course
article
i,
section
2
of
the
election
of
members
of
congress,
the
seventeenth
amendment
in
which
the
election
of
senators,
the
elector's
qualifications
are
based
on
the
qualifications
of
the
electorates
to
the
most
numerous
house
of
the
state
legislature.
now,
the
right
of
determination
of
qualifications
is
limited
according
to
other
decisions
of
this
court.
and
i
would
say
now
by
the
fifteenth,
nineteenth,
and
twenty-fourth
amendments
and
by
the
equal
protection
clause
insofar
as
they
might
--
there
might
be
arbitrary
and
invidious
discrimination.
the
petitioner
did
discuss
in
his
brief
some
of
the
language
used
by
this
court
in
the
--
both
the
legislative
and
congressional
redistricting
cases.
i
won't
go
into
detail
on
those
but
those
cases
dealt
with
discrimination
in
the
weighing
or
denying
of
the
equal
weight
of
the
vote
of
qualified
voters
within
the
state.
those
who
were
determined
to
qualify
by
state
law.
and
this
of
course,
i
wish
to
point
out
is
a
different
situation
and
that
exist
--
that
existed
there.
now
i
will
agree
with
the
petitioner
in
this
case
that
generally
speaking
this
court
has
held
in
its
past
decisions
that
the
interest
of
the
public
as
distinguished
from
those
of
a
class
requires
interference
and
that
the
means
adopted
are
reasonably
necessary
and
not
unduly
oppressive
on
the
individual.
that
was
held
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
lawton
versus
steele,
152
u.s.
137.
now,
i
also
wish
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
it
has
been
held
in
the
past
that
when
a
provision
or
a
law
is
attacked,
that
if
there
any
state
of
facts
that
would
sustain
it,
then
there
is
a
presumption
of
the
existence
of
that
state
of
facts,
and
the
person
assailing
that
classification
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
legislation
act
--
legislative
action
is
arbitrary.
again,
this
court
held
that
the
determination
of
the
legislature
will
not
be
questioned
if
grounds
may
reasonably
be
conceived
to
justify.
that
was
held
in
one
case,
metropolitan
casualty
company
of
new
york
versus
brownell
in
295
u.s.
580.
and
we
can
name
a
number
of
them
on
down
until
recent
times
in
which
this
court
has
held
that
it's
only
invidious
and
arbitrary
discrimination
with
which
we're
interested
in.
alright
now,
historically,
we
might
go
back
a
little.
states
have
classified
and
prohibited
certain
classes
of
people
from
voting.
and
as
has
been
mentioned,
among
these
people
in
these
classes,
and
these
are
each
classes
are
miners,
lunatics,
women,
indians,
poppers,
felons,
colored
people,
people
not
owning
property,
and
members
of
the
military.
now
certainly,
we
have
had
some
constitutional
amendments
that
have
eliminated
some
of
these
discriminations.
to
go
back
to
the
time
when
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
passed
and
shortly
thereafter,
this
court
decided
the
case
of
miner
versus
happersett
in
--
reported
in
21
wall.
178.
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
fourteenth
amendment
did
not
grant
citizenship
to
anyone,
that
the
women
already
were
citizens
of
this
country.
that
if
the
right
of
suffrage
was
a
necessary
privilege
of
citizenship
then
the
constitution
of
missouri
which
denied
the
women
the
right
to
vote
would
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
however,
this
was
not
the
case
as
it
was
held
that
the
power
of
the
state
was
supreme
to
set
out
the
qualifications
even
in
national
elections.
it
was
further
stated
that
article
iv,
section
2
didn't
confer
the
right
to
vote.
and
if
suffrage
was
necessary
like
in
the
incident
of
national
citizenship,
then
the
citizens
of
each
state
would
be
entitled
to
vote
in
every
other
state
where
they
might
happen
to
be
just
as
if
they
were
citizen
of
that
state.
again,
just
a
few
years
later
in
1876,
in
u.s.
versus
cruikshank,
the
court
held
that
it
appears
that
the
right
of
suffrage
is
not
a
necessary
attribute
of
national
citizenship
but
that
exemption
from
discrimination
and
the
exercise
of
that
right
on
account
of
race
is
the
right
to
vote
in
the
state
comes
from
the
state.
but
the
right
of
the
exemption
from
the
prohibited
discrimination
comes
from
the
united
states,
the
fifteenth
amendment.
the
first
has
not
been
granted
or
secured
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
but
the
last
one
has.
now
we
feel
that
these
cases
are
rather
significant
because
as
this
court
held
in
the
case
of
u.s.
versus
wong
kim
ark
in
169
u.s.
649.
the
interpretations
by
authorities
in
the
field
at
the
relative
time
that
an
act
or
amendment
was
passed
should
be
given
even
more
weight
than
the
debates
in
the
congress
in
the
legislative
history.
another
contemporary
author
of
that
particular
time
had
commented
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
the
honorable
george
w.
mccrary,
judge
of
the
u.s.
circuit
court
of
the
eighth
circuit
and
formerly
he
was
chairman
of
the
committee
on
elections
of
the
house
of
representatives.
he
stated
in
a
work
that
he
had
published,
“a
treatise
on
the
american
law
of
elections”
which
was
published
in
1875
and
again
revised
in
1880,
that
the
right
of
suffrage
is
not
a
natural
right
nor
is
it
an
absolute
and
unqualified
right.
it
is
a
right
derived
in
this
country
from
the
constitution
and
statutes.
it
is
regulated
by
the
states
in
their
power
to
fix
the
qualifications
of
voters
as
limited
only
by
the
provisions
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
which
forbids
any
discrimination
on
account
of
race,
color,
or
previous
condition
of
servitude.
and
then
again,
in
1887,
property
plane
of
the
washington
bar,
compared
the
treatise
on
the
law
of
elections
to
public
offices
in
which
he
commented
that
accordingly,
the
right
of
suffrage
is
in
fact
enjoined
in
the
united
states
as
in
england
only
by
a
minority
of
members
of
the
state.
it
is
in
practice
held
--
withheld
from
women
and
in
theory,
if
not
in
practice,
from
miners,
idiots,
lunatics,
and
criminals
which
five
classes
together
constitute
a
majority
of
the
citizens
of
the
united
states.
these
authorities
all
held
in
effect
that
state
suffrage
laws
could
be
discriminatory.
and
except
for
the
fifteenth
amendment,
there
was
no
constitutional
inhibition.
that
was
felt
necessary
that
the
constitution
be
amended
to
prevent
discriminate
--
discriminatory
classifications
because
of
race,
trade
or
color
as
set
out
--
or
race
or
previous
condition
of
servitude
as
set
out
in
the
fifteenth
amendment.
and
again
in
the
nineteenth
amendment,
we
had
the
elimination
of
women
from
the
discrimination.
now
--
or
the
states
forbidden
to
place
military
personnel
in
a
separate
and
distinct
class
when
they
find
a
valid
reason
to
do
so.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
think
that
is
correct.
at
least
they
have
been
voting.
that
was
overlooked
by
the
legislature
i'm
sure
and
the
people
in
citing
and
adopting
(inaudible).
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
alright
sir,
i'll
try
to
do
so.
now
going
back
of
course,
i
think
that
this
court
is
aware
and
will
take
notice
of
the
fact
that
there
have
been
a
number
of
discriminatory
laws
passed
in
favor
of
people
in
military
service.
i
believe,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
mentioned
some
of
those
earlier.
you
have
laws
giving
military
the
right
to
get
a
pension.
you
have
the
--
of
discrimination
in
civil
--
in
jobs
in
civil
service
regulations,
and
loan
preferences,
and
for
example,
i
think
you
might
also
state
that
in
most
instances
jury
service
is
another
area
where
military
men
are
not
required
to
serve.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
mr.
justice
white,
i'm
not
contending
if
that's
a
reason,
just
an
example
to
show
discrimination
does
exist
in
other
fields
in
favor
of
the
military
as
they
are
now
claiming
there
is
some
discrimination
against
them
in
this
area.
i
think
you'll
find
that
historically
and
this
question
was
asked
if
there
were
other
states
that
prohibited
or
had
equal
provisions
regarding
the
voting
privileges
of
the
military.
and
mrs.
wall
will
discuss
that
in
more
detail
but
i
might
point
out
that
historically,
an
early
pennsylvanian
case
of
chase
versus
miller
held
that
the
right
of
a
soldier
to
vote
is
confined
to
the
election
district
where
he
resided
at
the
time
he
entered
the
military
service,
same
situation
we
have
here.
again,
it
was
stated
in
paragraph
71,
page
50
of
planes
treatise
on
the
law
of
elections,
that
enlistment
in
service
on
the
army
of
the
united
states
do
not
disqualify
an
elector
from
voting
at
the
place
of
his
legal
residence
but
he
cannot
by
service
of
a
military
post
acquire
the
residence
prescribed
by
law
as
one
of
the
qualifications
of
an
elector.
also
cited
in
the
cases
of
contested
elections
in
congress
by
clark
and
hall
as
the
case
of
(inaudible)
richard
versus
wayne
at
page
512
which
states
that
a
requirement
that
soldiers
must
remain
a
year
after
discharge
in
an
area
if
they
wish
to
vote,
if
the
voting
requirement
is
a
one
year
residence.
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
how
long
they
might
have
been
stationed
there.
that
they
cannot
begin
to
acquire
residence
for
voting
purposes
until
they
have
been
there
a
year
after
discharge.
now
those
are
a
few
examples
of
cases
where
military
classification
has
existed.
i
think
this
court
will
concede
that
this
government,
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
of
all
of
the
states
have
most
jealously
guarded
against
the
military
taking
over
the
civilly
--
the
civil
government
in
the
country.
as
i
understand
it,
the
constitution
of
49
of
our
states
now
has
some
provision
in
that
regard,
that
the
military
will
be
subordinate
to
the
civilian.
then
we
might
say,
is
this
discrimination
invidious?
we
would
say
that
it
was
and
i
think
it
was
pointed
out
a
little
earlier
in
one
of
the
questions
that
texas,
i
believe
mr.
justice
black
asked
if
this
one,
the
modification
of
our
constitution.
it
certainly
is
a
modification.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
a
reform,
i
beg
your
pardon.
that's
a
little
stronger
language.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
it
is
a
reform
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
it
is
because
texas
did
not
allow
the
military
to
vote
at
all.
and
there
was
historically
a
good
reason
for
it.
and
shortly
after
texas
won
their
independence,
the
army
tried
to
take
over
the
government
and
they
were
seeking
to
imprison
president
barnett
and
later
when
sam
houston
became
president,
he
was
able
to
disperse
the
army.
now
that
has
been
not
fair
in
the
background
and
in
the
reasoning
for
the
--
in
the
history
of
this
particular
provision
in
the
constitution.
in
1954,
the
people
by
a
vote,
the
constitution
is
amended
in
texas
by
first
the
legislature
passing
the
matter
and
then
it's
being
given
to
the
people
to
vote
on.
this
amendment
was
adopted
allowing
some
latitude
there.
and
certainly
i
don't
know
the
reasoning,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
and
i
can't
state
--
put
any
valid
reason
why
as
so
not
including
the
wives
other
than
the
fact
maybe
they
thought
they
would
not
be
under
direct
military
control.
i
can't
honestly
answer
if
i
know
that
if
any
consideration
was
actually
given
to
the
fact
that
the
wives
were
not
prohibited
by
this
amendment.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
do
because
now
the
reason
given
by
the
legislature
and
given
in
the
opinion
of
our
supreme
court,
was
that
this
was
to
prevent
a
concentration
of
military
vote
in
a
particular
area,
in
a
particular
county,
whereby
the
military
might
take
over
the
local
government.
texas
is
maybe
unique.
i
don't
imagine
it
has
these
many
people
in
military
service
as
california
but
we
do
have
at
all
times
some
162,000
members
of
the
military
within
the
limits
of
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
can't
answer
that.
i
know
that
california
has
some
awfully
large
establishments
since
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
sir?
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that
couldn't
be.
i
have
not
check
on
proportionate
numbers.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
our
voting
laws
require
that
they
be
domiciled
in
the
state
for
a
period
of
one
year
and
in
the
county
for
a
period
of
six
months.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
well,
that
--
i
think
that
would
be
a
question
of
intent.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that's
right
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
--
mr.
brennan.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
at
the
present
time
under
the
present
state
of
the
law,
i
don't
think
--
don't
know
the
exact
percentage
of
--
that
have
acquired
domicile.
i
will
say
this
that
some
of
the
figures
we
have
indicate
that
93%
have
been
there
less
than
five
years.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
in
a
good
many
instances
and
of
course
there
are
a
lot
of
military
that
do
retire
in
the
areas
of
the
places
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
--
where
the
served.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
retired
military
are
not
affected.
when
they're
out
of
the
service,
they're
free
to
vote
wherever
they
wish.
this
inhibition
of
course
was
for
that
particular
purpose.
and
some
of
the
theories
that
were
related
or
could
be
related,
i
think
we've
had
examples
of
military
indoctrinating
soldiers
on
a
particular
theory
of
military
commander.
we've
had
that
instances
of
that
in
the
past.
if
a
commander
want
to
order
his
men
or
suggest
to
his
men
which
would
under
the
military
concept
that
the
commander
giving
the
orders
and
the
soldier
obeying,
and
asking
him
to
show
their
residences
taxes
and
telling
them
they
wanted
everyone
to
do
it.
i
don't
know
how
much
would
--
fear
that
would
be
created
if
they
would
not
change
their
residence
or
their
domicile
to
texas
on
their
records.
if
they
did
that,
that
possibly
would
be
the
only
requirement
under
our
present
laws
to
show
that
they
were
domicile
if
this
provision
is
not
dealt.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
any
eligible
voter
is
eligible
to
run
for
office.
now
there
are
some
inhibitions
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
age
so
on
and
member
of
the
legislature
during
the
term
can't
run
for
another
office
or
be
appointed
to
another
office.
certain
other
offices
where
he
might
have
had
vote
in
creating
the
office
or
raising
the
pay
or
some
such
matters
is
there
or
some
other
public
officials
can't
run
for
the
legislature
while
their
term
--
they
can't
resign
from
office
to
run
for
the
legislature
in
other
words.
nor
--
and
i
think
under
our
laws
and
constitution
you
--
or
that
you
cannot
hold
two
public
offices,
you
would
be
--
or
two
positions
or
receive
remuneration
from
two
government
sources.
a
soldier
would
be
prohibited
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
--
from
running
for
office.
if
that
was
the
--
what
--
the
question
you
wish
answered.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
think
it
probably
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
now
certainly,
one
of
the
principal
reasons
that
require
a
person
to
become
a
resident
and
remain
in
a
state
for
a
number
of
months
or
years
is
to
acquire
a
community
of
interest.
one
of
our
court
decided
(inaudible)
on
the
constitution
is
saying
that
if
he
lacks
a
community
of
interest
in
the
laws
which
are
to
govern
the
community,
it
is
not
only
a
serious
danger
but
a
false
principle
to
give
to
him
for
thus
you
have
given
power
to
the
hand
which
is
alien
to
the
rights
of
others
which
he
controls.
now,
let's
extend
that
situation
and
we
have
had
the
argument
that
the
military
are
just
like
any
other
particular
group
of
persons
having
jobs
as
construction
workers
as
other
people.
let
me
point
out
to
this
court,
there's
one
major
difference.
a
military
man
does
not
have
the
freedom
of
choice.
yes,
he
might
give
a
preference
of
a
location
or
station.
whether
the
military
sees
fit
to
send
him
there
or
not
is
another
matter,
and
if
he's
an
enlisted
man,
and
he's
ordered
to
go
to
a
particular
locality,
he
had
better
go.
he
has
no
freedom
of
choice
in
that
connection.
he
has
to
go.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that's
correct;
he
doesn't
have
to
change
his
domicile.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
but
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that's
the
difference
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
his
own
state
of
mind.
he
is
different
from
a
construction
worker
in
that
regard.
construction
worker
can
quit
his
job
if
he
didn't
want
to
go.
or
if
the
construction
is
over
he
can
maintain
his
home
and
find
new
employment.
during
the
period
of
an
enlistment,
the
serviceman
can't
do
that.
we
do
have
that
knowledge
on
their
part
that
they
will
be
moving
on.
and
that
certainly
in
some
of
our
smaller
counties
could
have
a
very
vital
effect.
before
--
i
think
as
i
recall
something
like
39,000
people
assigned
to
it
roughly.
it's
in
two
counties,
two
small
counties;
one
county,
the
largest
city
as
i
recall
is
10,000
or
12,000
people
(inaudible).
the
other
has
a
relatively
small
population.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
only
--
only
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that
is
correct.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
that
is
correct.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
or
present
home.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
my
present
home.
i
do
--
i
thought
that
i
had
answered
the
question
that
you
asked
regarding
how
many
people
would
be
affected.
now
certainly
we
do
not
have
statistics
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
--
i
grant
you
that.
but
we
were
talking
about
indoctrination
by
a
military
commander.
if
the
military
commander
is
in
disagreement
with
the
local
government,
he
could
suggest
that
his
men
are
domicile
to
texas.
he
could
suggest
that
they
might
want
to
get
rid
of
the
local
government.
i'm
talking
about
possibilities
now.
and
that
if
that
suggestion
is
conceived
as
an
order
by
those
men,
certainly
--
and
enough
of
them
do
change
their
domicile
or
go
down
and
vote,
and
have
been
indoctrinated
in
the
manner
of
thinking
of
the
military
commander.
now
it's
true
that
the
military
commander
might
be
disciplined
but
the
election
would
be
over,
the
vote
would
be
cast.
the
results
of
the
election
would
be
excited
regardless
of
what
later
happened
to
the
military
commander.
although
we
did
on
occasion
have
military
commanders,
i
know
in
the
past,
disciplined
for
improper
indoctrination
of
their
troops.
that
was
the
danger
that
the
legislature
and
the
people
of
texas
felt
that
actually
existed
in
adopting
this
and
relaxing
the
prohibition
against
military
voting
at
all.
so
i
wish
that
the
court
would
bear
that
in
mind
that
in
the
exercise
of
the
discretion
of
the
court
or
--
and
of
the
--
rather
of
the
legislature
and
the
people.
they
felt
that
this
danger
did
exist,
that
there
was
enough
danger
to
--
although
they
wanted
to
allow
military
to
vote,
they
did
want
to
restrain
that
vote
to
the
place
where
the
man
entered
the
service.
if
you
excuse
a
personal
example,
i
vote
absentee.
i
moved
to
austin
less
than
a
year
ago.
i
still
vote
in
brownsville.
the
military
man
has
the
same
right.
if
he's
entered
the
service
from
texas
or
from
another
state,
he
can
still
vote
where
he
came
from.
if
he
didn't
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
i
don't
know
if
that's
true
in
all
states,
sir,
but
i'm
sure
that
in
every
state,
gives
the
military
man
the
right
to
vote
absentee.
i
don't
know
that
any
state
that
does
not
have
absentee
voting
rights
and
does
so
permit.
certainly,
texas
does.
we
have
equally
as
many
men
in
service
from
texas
as
we
have
stationed
in
the
service
in
texas.
those
people
are
voting
absentee
if
they
wished,
if
they
too
have
not
changed
their
residence
to
another
state.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
if
he
enters
military
service
in
el
paso.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
and
changes
his
residency
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
he
--
if
he
changes
his
residence,
his
legal
residence
from
el
paso,
then
he
can't
vote.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
no
because
he
has
already
changed.
if
he
maintained
his
residence
in
el
paso
regardless
of
where
--
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
--
he
descends.
mr.
hawthorne
phillips
it
applies
equally
within
the
class.
now,
i
want
to
point
out
one
other
thing
before
i
do
leave.
sergeant
carrington
came
to
texas
at
the
time
these
laws
were
already
in
existence.
this
was
not
something
that
was
passed
after
he
got
there.
it
was
an
existing
law,
an
existing
condition.
he
came
in
to
texas,
decided
to
live
there,
knowing
that
this
condition
did
exist.
now
why
he
chose
el
paso,
it
--
if
--
it
was
because
texas
doesn't
have
an
income
tax
and
new
mexico
does.
if
you
reside
in
new
mexico
or
whether
the
facilities
of
the
commissary
and
the
post
exchange
existed,
i
don't
know.
he
did
come.
he
did
come
with
the
law
of
being
as
it
was
in
a
set
of
facts
and
conditions
that
he
found
and
he
--
now
he
is
asking
to
change
those
already
existing
facts
and
conditions.
thank
you.
