justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
--
does
that
mean
permanently?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
--
why
don't
you
think
some
point
of
a
--
there
being
a
discrimination
between
military
people,
mainly
those
who
are
allowed
to
vote
in
texas
and
those
who
aren't?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
--
for
the
military
man
who
goes
into
service
in
texas,
and
he
serves
there
and
retains
his
home
in
the
county
where
he
entered
the
service.
and
then
stationed
to
another
county,
could
he
still
vote
in
the
first
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
--
and
yet
he's
still
a
military
man.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
understand
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
let's
assume
that
there
are
10,000
military
men
entered
the
service
in
x
county
in
texas
and
they're
stationed
there
in
x
county.
there's
no
question
as
to
what
--
they
can
vote?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there's
no
question
if
they
could
vote
if
they
all
retained
their
home
there
and
was
stationed
in
the
adjoining
the
county.
there's
no
question
what
they
can
vote
in
x
county.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
are
10,000
servicemen
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
i
my
point
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there's
10,000
military
men
in
x
--
in
y
county
who
lives
in
x
county,
who
can
vote
in
x
county
and
there
are
10,000
others
in
y
county
who
live
in
new
mexico
and
they
can't
vote
in
texas.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
we
have
to
inquire
the
differences
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me,
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
this
man
could
not
vote
in
alabama
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
on
this
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
telling
a
lie
to
alabama?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you
say
that
i
understand
what
you
said
about
there
being
no
discrimination
among
military
people
as
far
as
the
texas
constitution
is
concerned.
my
point
was
that
the
reason
you
say
that
you
won't
let
this
particular
military
man
vote
and
others
like
him,
is
that
maybe
this
military
man
doesn't
have
the
interest,
interest
enough
in
the
local
government
to
justify
--
of
permitting
him
to
vote
because
he
may
be
moving
on.
well
this
is
--
do
you
say
it
follows
from
the
fact
that
he's
a
military
man
but
you
do
let
other
military
men
with
the
same
kind
of
problem
about
him
to
vote
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
people
who
entered
texas,
who
entered
the
service
in
texas
and
are
allowed
to
go
to
texas,
are
in
the
military
and
they
aren't
even
in
texas
and
may
never
be
there
again.
and
you
permit
them
to
vote
all
the
time.
and
yet
the
person
who
had
--
like
this
gentleman
who
has
decided
to
live
in
texas,
he's
there
on
the
spot,
he
has
a
home
there,
he
has
his
family,
he's
not
off
in
hawaii
or
alaska,
or
some
place,
he
may
never
return.
i'm
just
suggesting
that
the
reason
you
have
for
discriminating
between
one
military
man
and
another
maybe
--
may
bear
some
examination,
that's
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
a
fellow
who
--
but
if
there
is
a
--
if
in
the
carpool
with
the
--
with
this
sergeant
here
happens
to
be
of
a
texas
res
--
a
fellow
who
entered
the
service
in
el
paso
--
in
el
paso,
texas,
and
he's
working
up
at
white
sands
and
riding
back
and
forth
with
him.
this
sergeant
can't
vote
and
the
other
fellow
can.
now
you
tell
me
how
you
distinguish
between
those
two
military
men?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
just
--
everybody
accepts
the
fact
here
that
this
sergeant
is
living
in
el
paso
and
he's
going
to
live
there.
he
wants
to
make
it
his
home,
that's
the
record.
that's
the
fact
for
itself.
so
here
are
two
residents
of
el
paso,
the
city
of
el
paso.
one
entered
the
service
from
--
when
he
was
in
alabama.
the
other
entered
the
service
when
he
was
in
el
paso
and
they
both
work
at
white
sands,
both
ride
together
up
work
everyday.
both
go
to
the
polling
place,
one
can
vote,
one
can't.
now
what
--
just
what
--
how
do
you
distinguish
between
those
two
people?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
add
a
third
man
to
this
group.
there's
another
fellow
who
entered
this
service
from
el
paso.
the
only
thing
is,
he
moved
to
albuquerque.
he
was
first
shifted
up
to
to
albuquerque
and
then
he
was
shifted
to
the
white
sands,
could
he
retain
his
--
his
family
is
in
albuquerque
and
he
drives
down
to
white
sands
everyday
from
albuquerque.
and
he
says,
“i
don't
have
--
i
don't
know
why
you
want
to
live
in
el
paso.
i'm
never
going
back
to
el
paso.
i
--
as
far
as
i
know,
i'm
going
to
live
in
albuquerque.”
but
he
works
at
the
same
des
--
the
white
sands
with
these
other
two
fellows
who
live
in
el
paso
and
two
of
them
can
go
down
to
el
paso
and
vote
and
this
other
one
can't,
this
argue
--
in
his
case
can't.
and
this
fellow
has
no
more
interest
in
el
paso
and
--
well,
he
certainly
hasn't
got
the
interest
that
the
sergeant
does,
he's
going
to
live
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
66%
who
are
in
--
who
in
for
a
--
or
in
for
a
long
time
have
no
reason
to
continue
to
claim
residence
where
they
entered
the
service
that
nevertheless
doesn't
mean
that
they
have
no
interest
in
maintaining
residence
somewhere,
almost
all
of
them
before
very
long
are
going
to
want
to
plan
for
the
future
upon
retirement.
and
they
do
pick
out
localities
to
live,
and
just
like
this
sergeant.
because
it's
your
--
your
position
of
course
does
mean
that
--
if
the
sergeant
is
21
years
old
or
22
years
old,
and
he's
going
to
stay
in
until
the
time
of
retirement.
he's
permanently
disenfranchised.
if
he
is
serious
about
living
in
el
paso
and
he
maintains
his
home
there,
he
could
never
vote
for
20
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
the
record
we
have
before
us.
he
can't
vote
anywhere.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
but
if
he
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
were
22
or
23
or
he
could
be
--
he
could
be
prevented
from
voting
for
the
rest
of
his
military
career.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
mrs.
wall,
your
problem
only
comes
up
when
someone
does
qualify
under
your
residence
qualifications.
that's
the
only
time
you
have
a
problem
because
without
that
problem
--
without
--
unless
they
do,
they
don't
get
to
vote
anyway.
and
if
anyone
else
besides
the
sergeant
does
qualify
as
a
resident
of
el
paso
or
any
other
county
in
texas,
he
joins
the
sergeant
in
that
class.
and
there,
that's
the
only
kind
of
people
that
there
is
any
problem
about
whatsoever.
all
the
rest
of
the
people
are
disqualified
because
they
don't
meet
your
residence
requirements.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
until
they
exercise
the
option
though
to
become
residents,
they
are
no
problem
to
you
whatsoever.
and
when
they
do
exercise
the
option,
they're
just
like
the
sergeant
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
i'm
--
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
he
does
satisfy
your
residence
requirement
and
he
has
to
say
that
before
he
can
vote
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
just
said
so.
he
has
to
say
that
before
he
can
vote
at
all.
and
until
he
--
until
and
unless
he
does
say
that,
he
can't
vote
anyway
in
the
city
--
in
texas.
justice
byron
r.
white
none
of
these
permanent
--
none
of
these
career
people
whom
you
say
are
potential
voters
can
vote
at
all
until
and
unless
one
or
more
of
them
says
just
what
the
sergeant
says.
i
like
--
i
want
to
--
i'm
going
to
make
texas
my
home.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
all
he's
really
saying
--
all
that
he
is
really
saying
is
that
i
have
no
present
intention
of
leaving
el
paso.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
somebody
else
comes
along
and
says,
“i'm
going
to
make
texas
my
home.
i
have
no
intention
of
living
here.
i
have
no
present
intention
of
living
here.
i
am
a
resident.
i'm
a
dom
--
i'm
making
my
domicile
in
texas.”
he
proves
that.
he's
proving
as
much
as
anybody
ever
has
to
prove
or
as
much
as
anybody
can
prove,
but
the
sergeant
can't
prove
to
anyone
that
he's
going
to
stay
in
el
paso
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
aren't
you
really
--
that
only
--
your
only
problem
arises
with
those
people
who
like
the
sergeant
do
establish
a
domicile
in
your
state
and
required
residence.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
see
any
difference
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
see
any
meaningful
difference
between
them
and
the
sergeant.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
fine.
thank
you
very
much.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
besides,
this
isn't
one
of
those
areas.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
(inaudible)
--
el
paso
isn't
one
of
those
areas.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
about
this
--
what
about
this
situation.
say
that
there
is
a
--
say
that
down
at
colorado
springs,
colorado
there
is
a
camp
of
12,000
military
men
and
they're
all
--
are
stationed
there
for
four
years
and
they
all
qualified
to
vote.
they
all
say
we're
going
to
--
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
and
--
then
four
years
later
--
and
they
also
vote
of
many
improvements
on
roads
and
things
like
that,
after
the
camp
things
like
that
and
then
four
years
later,
the
camp
is
closed.
they
all
departed.
