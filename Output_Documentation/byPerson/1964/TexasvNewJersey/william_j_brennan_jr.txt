justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
mr.
kehoe,
moving
on
with
my
memory
of
the
new
jersey
statute
is
that,
even
under
that
statute,
a
good
deal
of
hunting
is
done
--
before
there
is
finally
an
escheat,
and
that
hunting
does
indeed
turn
up
people
at
other
addresses
than
on
the
books
of
the
company
and
that
we
come
down
to
a
residue
as
a
practical
matter
in
those
cases.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
the
hunting
has
been
unsuccessful.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
i
suppose,
when
you
said
earlier
that
you
thought
that
the
amounts
are
decreasing,
i
expect
that
must
deflect
procedures
that
these
companies
are
adopting
to
do
a
better
job
of
hunting
up
owners
before
you
get
around
to
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
but
i
gathered,
is
it
the
company's
effort
or
is
it
the
escheating
state
that
goes
to
the
procedure
if
the
court
is
the
final
entity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
somehow
the
company
sends
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
understand,
the
companies
do
indeed
make
efforts
to
locate.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
it's
only
after
these
things
fail,
these
efforts
fail,
that
they
get
into
these
boxes
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
largely
by
advertisements
and
such?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
last
known
address
is
clear
and
simple
contact
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
last
known
address
is
the
place
where
the
man,
the
claimant,
stayed
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it,
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
test,
in
any
event,
would
emphasize
the
contacts
of
the
debtor
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
we
all
primarily
be
concerned
with
is
the
owner
who
is
the
chap
who's
owed
the
money.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
ballard.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
noticed
$11,000
were
--
at
least
representing
that
number
of
owners
have
turned
up
and
they've
been
paid
and
they're
out
of
this
case.
is
that
the
new
part
of
the
cost
of
anything
that
sun
did
to
find
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
ballard,
these
states
do
have
statutes.
is
the
common
feature
that
they
had
some
kind
of
a
holding
period
before,
so
that
owners
may
have
an
opportunity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
might
be
cheaper
to
find
the
actual
owner.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
for
35
cents
and
they'll
file
a
report
for
15
cents.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
i
know,
but
if
we
say
last
known
address,
why
isn't
that
to
exclude
the
state
of
incorporation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
after
this
court
handed
down
a
decision,
if
we
dealt
about
that
as
a
rule,
it
would
be
a
defense
that
might
actually
let
you,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
company
could
tell
you,
“you
can't
have
it.
it's
the
last
known
address.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wasn't
the
aggregate
from
the
standard
oil
case
to
a
million?
