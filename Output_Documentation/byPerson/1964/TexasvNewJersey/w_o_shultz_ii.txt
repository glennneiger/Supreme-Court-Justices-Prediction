mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
as
a
controversy
between
texas,
new
jersey,
pennsylvania,
and
florida
over
certain
intangible
obligations
which
were
incurred
in
the
course
of
business
of
sun
oil
company,
which
of
course
is
a
state
which
is
involved
in
operations
throughout
all
the
states
or
rather,
they
have
permit
to
do
business
in
all
the
states
and
do
business
in
many
of
them.
the
particular
obligations
which
we
are
concerned
with
in
this
case
arose
out
of
the
operations
of
two
district
offices
located
in
texas
and
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
district
or
division
offices.
their
home
office
is
in
philadelphia
but
they
maintain
throughout
the
united
states
certain
division
offices
and
the
record,
according
to
the
stipulation,
shows
that
the
two
offices
in
texas
were
more
or
less,
autonomous
in
the
scope
of
their
operations
there
in
texas.
they
conducted
placing
agreements,
drilling.
they
operated
for
oil
and
gas
in
texas
as
well
as
neighboring
states.
they
contracted
for
their
own
labor
hiring
and
firing,
and
handled
their
own
payroll,
and
so
on.
new
jersey
is
claiming
that,
as
a
domiciliary
state
of
the
corporation,
that
it
is
entitled
to
take
all
of
these
obligations.
florida
contends
that,
as
the
state
of
the
last
known
address,
contend
for
a
theory
that
the
last
known
address
should
govern
as
to
which
state
has
the
power
to
take
possession
of
these
unclaimed
obligations.
we,
as
an
alternative
to
the
position
which
was
adopted
by
the
special
master
which
concluded
that
all
of
these
obligations
had
a
status
with
the
creditor,
therefore,
only
the
state
wherein
the
last
known
address,
they
had
the
power
to
deal
with
these
obligations,
well,
it
seemed
to
us,
in
taking
this
approach,
that
you
ignore
many
of
the
equities
concerning
the
transaction
out
of
which
these
obligations
arose.
and,
that
you
take
a
rather
arbitrary
single
factor
surrounding
a
particular
obligation
when
you
know
other
circumstances
surrounding
the
same
obligation
which
might
enact
with
the
injustice,
in
fairness
to
everyone,
give
some
other
state
a
better
claim
to
these
intangibles
under
their
state
actions.
we,
in
addition,
feel
very
strongly
about
the
fact
that
such
a
rou√©
would
allow
the
accretion,
so
to
speak,
of
the
oil
in
--
proceeds
from
oil
and
gas
of
the
state
of
texas
and
allow
them
to
be
trickled
out
a
piece
of
meal
to
other
states
when,
under
the
law
of
texas,
oil
and
gas
in
place
is
a
real
estate
and,
also,
that
the
rights
to
delay
rentals
have
been
considered
as
a
real
property
right
in
texas.
now,
we
admit
that,
under
texas
law,
once
these
minerals
have
been
produced
and
once
the
delay
rentals
are
due
that
they're
considered
to
be
personal
realty.
but,
there
are
cases
which
recognize,
and
i
think
it's
an
established
principle
in
the
law,
that
even
though
you
may
have
personal
realty
that
it
may
be
so
connected
with
the
real
estate
or
real
property
interest
that
it
may
be
considered
immovable
by
the
state
within
which
the
property
from
which
is
located
was
derived.
and,
we
have
approached
the
problem
as
to
oil
and
gas
proceeds
and
the
delay
rentals
in
texas
from
that
stand
point.
we
cited
in
our
brief,
in
that
respect,
the
toledo
society
for
crippled
children
versus
hickok
which
does
not
directly
reach
that
point
but,
to
me,
it
gives
an
indication
that
the
texas
courts
would
be
and
are
very
reluctant
to
allow
the
laws
of
another
state
to
determine
title
to
anything
which
is
very
closely
related
to
the
realty
in
texas.
now,
in
that
case,
there
was
oil
and
gas
property
involved,
and
the
testator
residing
in
ohio,
at
his
death,
by
his
will,
set
up
trust
for
his
property,
the
residual
part
of
his
property,
whereby
part
of
it
would
go
to
--
the
proceeds
from
it
would
go
income
to
his
wife
and
children
for
20
years
and,
thereafter,
that
the
corpus
would
be
divided
up
among
certain
charitable
organizations.
under
ohio
law,
such
a
bequest
was
invalid
and
it
was
so
held
by
the
ohio
supreme
court.
well,
the
society
came
down
to
texas
and
filed
a
suit
in
texas
to
declare
their
interest
in
the
real
property
in
texas
valid
under
that
will.
if
we
look
a
little
at
the
operations
of
mr.
hickok,
he
was
in
partnership
with
a
texas
oil
operator
here
and
they
had
agreed,
shortly
before
his
death,
that
they
would
transfer
all
of
their
partnership
assets
which
consisted
of
certain
oil
and
gas
properties
to
a
corporation
and,
in
turn,
receive
stock
in
this
corporations
for
the
assets
which
they
transferred
the
real
property
they
transferred.
the
corporation
has
been
formed
at
the
death
of
mr.
hickok,
but
the
actual
transfer
had
not
been
carried
out
and
his
will
specifically
directed
that
his
executors
and
administrators
go
ahead
and
carry
out
that
provision,
which
they
did.
and,
actually,
the
case
went
off
on
the
theory
of
whether
or
not
equitable
conversion
applied
in
a
situation
such
as
this
where
you
have
a
conflict
of
laws
question
determining
the
validity
of
title
to
real
estate
or
the
proceeds
from
real
estate.
the
texas
court
held
that
even
though
this
realty
had
been
directed
by
the
will
to
be
converted
into
personal
realty
that,
in
determining
which
law,
whether
ohio
or
texas,
applied
to
determine
whether
these
charitable
organizations
were
to
receive
the
benefits
of
the
trust
that
the
testator
intended,
the
court
held
that
--
the
texas
supreme
court
held
that
the
doctrine
of
equitable
conversion
had
no
place
in
the
rules
pertaining
to
conflicts
of
law
in
saying
which
law
of
which
state
applied.
and,
they
applied
the
law
of
texas
and
upheld
the
validity
of
this
bequest
in
the
will.
in
the
course
of
that
opinion,
the
court
stated
that
the
interest
in
question
were
personal
realty
for
distribution
purposes.
they
were
yet
immovable
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
the
laws
of
england
or
hungry
applied.
they
were
talking
about
a
case
that
they
were
discussing
in
there
which
also
determined
a
question
of
--
conflict
of
law
question
over
which
law
would
apply
either
england
where
a
land
had
been
converted
into
personal
realty
and
bequeath
to
some
hungarian
persons,
or
whether
the
law
of
hungary
would
apply.
we'd
like
to
take
the
position
that
the
proceeds
of
these
estates
in
texas
are
so
closely
connected
with
the
estate.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
are
the
full
enjoinment
of
these
estates.
an
interest
in
oil
and
gas,
in
place,
has
no
value
other
than
the
probability
or
possibility
that
it
will
produce
and
bring
income
and
then
becomes
valuable,
and
the
enjoinment
accrues
to
the
owner
when,
in
fact,
there
is
that
deduction.
it
is
a
piece
meal
sale,
so
to
speak,
or
a
continuing
sale
of
the
real
property
interest.
and,
we
take
the
position
that
injustice
and
inequity
and
a
controversy
between
states
to
see
whose
law
shall
apply
to
take
possession
of
these
proceeds
from
this
deduction
when
it
has
been
abandoned
or,
so
to
speak,
unclaimed
by
the
rightful
owner
for
a
period
of
time
should
be
determined
under
texas
law
because
these
things
are
too
closely
related
to
the
title
to
texas
land
to
be
determined
by
the
law
of
another
state
because
it's
well
recognized
that
the
law
of
no
other
state
can
determine
the
title
to
the
realty
itself.
and,
for
that
reason,
we
urge
the
court
to
declare
that
the
texas
law
should
apply
to
all
proceeds
from
the
oil
and
gas
production
and
the
delay
rentals,
even
though
accrued
and
even
though
they
are,
under
texas
law,
personal
realty.
but,
that
they
are
personal
realty
of
such
a
nature
and
so-related
to
the
realty
that
they
have,
if
you
please,
presence
in
the
state
of
texas
only
for
purposes
of
determining
title.
the
same
question
was
touched
upon
in
commissioner
versus
skaggs
in
which
mr.
skaggs,
being
a
resident
of
texas,
he
and
his
wife
own
real
property
in
california
and
a
question
arose
over
whether
the
income
from
this
real
property
in
california
would
be
immunity
or
separate,
whether
they
could
return
a
joint
return
or
whether
he
had
violated
his
separate
property.
well,
the
court,
in
that
case,
even
though
the
marital
residence
was
in
texas,
looked
to
the
law
of
california
which
characterized
those
rentals
as
his
separate
property
and
they
discussed
the
problem
and
(inaudible)
into
crops
that
grow
on
the
land
and
admit
that
even
thought
once
the
crops
are
severed
they
are
personal
realty
but,
even
so,
the
title
to
them
should
be
determined
by
the
law
of
the
state
where
the
land
is
located
rather
than
to
allow
the
texas
law
to
characterize
them
as
something
else.
in
this
sense,
statutes
of
that
nature
operate
as
statutes
real
not
in
the
sense
they
are
operating
on
real
property
but
that
they
are
operating
on
the
thing
itself
rather
than
the
person.
and
in
fact
of
the
presence
of
the
thing
itself
give
this
importance.
in
addition
to
this
phase
of
our
argument
in
the
case,
we
look
upon
all
of
these
obligations,
of
course
they
are
intangible
obligations,
and
the
courts
--
various
courts
through
the
years
have
held
that
intangibles
have
a
status
here
and
they
have
a
status
there
for
various
purposes
and,
for
taxation
purposes,
generally
at
the
residence
of
the
person
to
whom
they
are
owned,
the
creditor.
but,
i
don't
think
that
this
is
an
inflexible
determination
that
the
courts
made.
considering
all
the
facts,
the
facts
that
the
land
--
there,
you
know
the
man
actually
is
living
in
a
certain
state
and
he
is
there
carrying
on
business
operations,
and
this
is
part
of
his
capital
with
which
he
works.
and,
that
state
gives
him
the
protection
of
its
laws
in
the
operation
of
his
business.
so,
i
don't
think
the
sole
consideration
in
those
cases,
even
though
they
say
that
the
status
is
with
his
residence,
i
think
they
take
in
the
other
factors
into
consideration
in
reaching
this
conclusion,
and
this
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
i
think
that
the
interest
of
the
creditor
should
always
be
primary
and
i
think
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
to
another
state
which
may
have
had
more
contact
with
the
transaction
out
of
which
it
arose.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
well,
as
between
--
this
is
a
controversy
between
the
states
and,
as
between
the
states,
i
think
the
solicitor
should
be
to
the
state
with
the
most
significant
context
with
the
transaction
out
of
which
it
arose.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
well,
i
think
that
is
that
the
fact
of
his
last
known
address
is
one
of
the
factors
to
be
considered
and
weighed
with
all
others,
but
i
don't
think
it
should
outweigh
all
of
it
because
in
the
mobility
of
our
population
today,
and
it's
becoming
more
mobile
every
day,
persons
are
within
one
state
for
today
and
they're
across
the
continent
the
next
day
and
they
have
moved
there
because
of
a
better
job
opportunity.
we
have
become
a
very
mobile
civilization
and
this
is
completely
outside
of
the
record
and
the
briefs
and
our
experience
in
texas.
people
have
claimed
a
property
which
we
have
taken
under
our
law
and
they
come
from
even
though
their
last
address
may
have
been
in
texas.
we
get
their
claim
forms
from
all
over
california,
florida
and
in
most
of
those
instances,
presumably,
it's
people
who
had
gone
there
to
retire
or
something.
and
yet,
here,
they
come
back
and
they
ask
us
for
their
money
and
they
are
not
anywhere
near
their
last
known
address.
now,
if
the
last
known
address
is
the
only
thing
you
know
about
the
transaction
then,
certainly,
that
should
bear
a
prime
consideration.
but,
where
you
know
these
other
factors,
for
instance,
back
to
our
texas
situation
again,
i'll
make
this
as
an
alternative
argument
to
our
prior
argument,
that,
there,
all
of
the
transactions
concerning
production
in
texas
of
oil
and
gas
certainly
took
place
in
texas.
these
local
offices
went
out
and
negotiated
the
leases.
they
directed
the
drilling,
the
production,
the
distribution
of
the
proceeds,
by
way
of
the
orders
which
were
signed,
among
the
owners,
splitting
up
the
proceeds.
the
drilling
took
place
there.
it's
a
daily
production
from
the
real
estate
there
in
texas.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
in
another
state?
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
it
is,
to
the
extent
--
to
a
certain
extent,
but
i
think
the
only
controversy
here
is
between
these
four
states.
now,
if
some
other
state
in
which
this
person's
last
known
address
was,
even
though
he
was
hired
by
the
texas
local
offices
and
worked
in
louisiana
state
and
he
was
directed
out
of
the
texas
offices,
still,
in
the
absence
of
some
claim
by
louisiana
as
between
these
states,
before
the
court
today,
texas
should
be
entitled
to
take
custody
of
that.
now,
if
louisiana
later
wants
to
assert
a
claim,
there's
nothing
under
this
court's
previous
language
in
standard
oil
case
and
which
was
quoted
in
western
union
case
which
said
what
some
other
state
may
claim
from
new
jersey
may
be
--
is
not
before
us
and
--
we
don't
foreclose
their
coming
before
this
court
to
make
that
determination.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
the
red
light
says
it's
time
for
recess.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
might
direct
myself
back
to
mr.
justice
goldberg's
question
concerning
the
wages
which
may
have
been
earned
in
various
others
states
outside
of
texas
but
under
the
direction
and
through
contract
through
the
sun
oil
company
division
offices.
now,
as
i
was
saying
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
context
of
the
state
of
texas
would
be
significant
with
such
transaction,
much
more
so
than
the
domiciliary
state
of
the
corporation
or
even
the
last
known
address
of
such
an
employee.
also,
in
that
line,
i
might
ask
the
question,
parenthetically,
of
where
would
this
person
look
for
his
wages
if
he
indeed
suddenly
woke
up
and
decided
‚Äúwell,
i
didn't
collect
all
my
wages
when
i
worked
for
the
beaumont
office
of
sun
oil
company‚Äù
and
if
he
was
living
at
that
time
in
louisiana,
he
certainly
wouldn't
go
back
to
his
last
address
in
louisiana.
he'd
look
then
he'd
contact
sun
oil
company
in
texas
and
the
wages
would
be
with
the
treasurer's
office
there
in
the
state
of
texas
being
unclaimed.
and,
this
same
consideration
certainly
holds
true
as
to
the
mineral
proceeds
and
production
of
oil
and
gas.
now,
a
person
living
in
any
of
the
other
states,
it
makes
no
difference
which
one,
he
is
not
going
to
look
to
his
last
known
address
when
he
suddenly
realizes
‚Äúwell,
way
back
there,
i
saw
an
advertisement
for
a
small
realty
interest
in
the
paper
in
texas
and
i
sent
my
$10
in
and
i
wonder
whatever
happened
to
that.‚Äù
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
as
between
these
states
here,
i
would
say
so.
but,
now,
as
to
what
some
other
state
may
have
as
a
claim
to
it
or
basis
of
a
claim
that
has
to
come
up
when
that
state
makes
a
claim
to
it.
and,
there's
nothing
to
preclude
such
another
state
from
coming
to
the
state
that
takes
under
this
decision
and
saying
before
this
court
again
‚Äúwe
have
a
better
claim
to
it
than
the
state
that
took
it.‚Äù
it's
a
problem
to
me
that,
in
the
absence
of
a
compact
between
the
states
are
completely
uniform
statute
enacted
by
all
the
states
which
uses
as
a
basis
the
last
known
address,
that
you
can't
solve
on
the
last
known
address
basis
and,
that
is,
having
a
built-in
reciprocity
clause
in
these
statutes
too,
whereby
if
one
state
takes
and,
later
or
at
the
same
time,
the
state
of
last
known
address
where
you
know
this
last
known
address
state
and
they
have
a
lack
of
statute
with
a
reciprocity
clause
and
then,
of
course,
one
state
will
refer
to
the
one
with
the
last
known
address.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
well,
that
would
be
hard
for
me
to
say.
probably,
under
the
contact
theory,
you
might,
unless
--
in
some
instances,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
context
would
be
so
significant
that
there
wouldn't
be
any
questions
about
it,
and
you
will
always
have
those
closer
questions
in
any
of
that.
but,
the
fact
that
the
person
is
no
longer
at
his
last
known
address,
to
me,
speaks
against
the
justice
and
equity
of
such
a
rou√©
when
you,
in
fact,
know
some
other
concrete
facts
about
the
transactions,
where
it
took
place
and
what
occurred.
now,
there's
also
the
problem
that
supposedly
is
up
in
the
area
from
my
view
point
of
the
master's
report
of
those
instances
where
there
is
no
last
known
address.
now,
the
master
said
that
new
jersey,
having
a
custodial
law,
could
of
course
take
these.
well,
texas
law
is
custodial
in
effect
and,
from
my
reading
of
the
florida
statute,
it
is,
too,
and
so
is
pennsylvania.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
do
i?
no,
i
really
think
it
makes
no
difference.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
well,
one
theory
is
that
the
--
i
mean,
the
difference
in
the
two,
of
course,
being
that
the
custodial
keeps
the
money
for
the
person
to
come
claim
it
and
the
other
takes
it
away
from
him.
it
just
depends
upon
the
benevolent
attitude
of
the
state
legislature
when
they
enact
such
statute,
but
there's
no
question,
it
seems
to
me,
in
this
case
of
jurisdictional
requirements
for
either
type
of
statute.
at
the
middle
east,
sun
oil
company
is
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
law,
the
states
have
before
the
court
and
the
pronouncements
of
this
court
here
before
and
other
courts
proceed
upon
the
theory
that
an
intangible,
if
you
can
get
personal
jurisdiction
of
a
debtor,
then
you've
got
jurisdiction
--
and
cite
the
creditor
by
publication
or
some
other
method
of
reasonable
notice,
then
you've
got
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
that
debt
or
obligation.
and,
we've
got
just
that
situation
here.
but,
i
just
fail
to
see
the
fairness
in
the
last
known
address
solely
as
a
basis.
as
i
say,
where
it's
the
only
thing
you
know,
perhaps
that
should
be
the
governing
basis,
but
then
we're
up
in
the
air
about
the
unknown
address
situations.
what
do
you
do
then?
then,
do
you
revert
to
the
points
of
contact
theory
for
those
transactions?
it
seems
to
me
that
would
lead
to
a
more
diverse
series
of
situations
than
would
the
points
of
contact
theory.
and,
for
those
reasons,
i
fail
to
see
the
justification
of
the
master
statement
that
the
state
of
new
jersey,
simply
because
it
had
a
custodial
statute,
could
take
the
unknown
proceeds.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
mr.
justice
black,
i've
been
thinking
with
this
problem
for
a
little
over
two
years
now
and
i've
arrived
at
no
simple
solution.
i
don't
believe
there
is
a
simple
solution.
as
i
said,
the
most
equitable
and
fair
solution
to
me
would
be
for
all
the
states
to
get
together
and
enter
into
a
compact
arrangement
or
adopt
uniform
statutes
which
--
with
reciprocity
clause
and
work
it
out
in
that
way.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
i
certainly
don't.
that
was
tentatively
tried
and
we
reached
no
concrete
result
and
nothing
ever
came
of
it.
the
only
way
it
may
occur
is
that
if
this
court
should
so-right
on
the
subject
that
it
might
become
necessary
for
him
to
do
that
to
realize
anything
or
realize
anything
substantial,
especially
in
this
case
of
unknown
last
address.
we
are
at
a
quandary
there
under
the
master's
report,
it
seems
to
me.
now,
i
think
that
the
solution
that
we
have
presented
is
an
equitable
and
fair
solution.
it
tries
to
weigh
all
the
considerations
and
gives
the
court
a
chance
to
weigh
considerations
and
arrive
at
a
just
and
equitable
results
which,
it's
my
understanding,
is
what
we're
supposed
to
try
to
do
under
our
jurisprudence.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
the
context
with
the
transaction
out
of
which
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
is
the
obligation
to
rule.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
i
think
you
would,
where
there
is
a
conflict
between
two
states,
an
actual
conflicting
claim,
a
controversy.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
they
are
potentially
a
great
many,
but
whether
they
develop
or
not
is
another
question.
just
as
in
this
case,
some
of
the
people's
last
known
addresses
are
states
like
illinois
and
other
states
which
have
escheat
statutes
but
none
of
them
had
been
asserting
a
claim
to
this
particular
property
and
they're
not
before
the
court.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
that's
right.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
that's
correct.
i
think
the
best
you
can
do
is
come
as
near
to
it
as
you
can.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
well,
sir
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
there
should
be,
but
if
that's
all
we
have
to
work
with
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
if
that's
what
we
have
to
work
with
in
order
to
achieve
a
just
and
equitable
result,
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
what
we
should
do.
now,
this
theory
we
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
always?
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
i
don't
think
we
can
deal
in
certainties
to
that
extent
and
say
always,
no
but
i
think,
in
the
majority
of
the
situations,
it
would.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
there
will
always
be
one
state
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
any
rule
of
the
court
shows
you
there
will
always
be
one
state
that's
going
to
be
satisfied
with
it
and
the
others
are
going
to
be
dissatisfied.
as
in
all
litigation,
there's
the
winner
and
the
loser.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
i
think
that's
correct.
i
certainly
will
agree
with
you.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
that
is
my
conclusion
and
my
best
studied
theory
on
the
situation
because
it
seems
to
me
that,
arbitrarily
saying,
something
is
here
because
the
man's
last
known
address
was
here
is
false
when,
in
fact,
the
man
isn't
there
and
hasn't
been
there
for
some
time,
obviously.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
well,
i
think
they
should
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
i
don't
think
that's
arbitrary.
i
think
it
only
becomes
arbitrary
when
there's
no
reasonable
or
sound
basis
for
the
result
or
the
decision
that
you
reached.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
but
he
obviously
isn't
there
anymore.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
there
is
some,
but
i
think
the
other
argument
outweighs
that
because
the
man
is
not
going
back
to
his
last
known
address
to
look
for
that
money.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
that's
correct.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
but
i
think,
certainly,
in
these
mineral
and
oil
and
gas
proceeds
he's
going
to
look
to
the
place
where
the
land
is
that
it's
flowing
from
and
inquire
about
his
property
in
those
instances.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
that's
true,
your
honor.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
the
only
thing
i
had
further
i
might,
in
answer
to
justice
black's
question,
i
was
just
skimming
through
here
and
here's
one
claim
in
this
report
for
$1,292.38.
that's
just
one
i
read
from
here
and,
as
to
the
largest,
the
largest
i
know
of
is
one,
we
have
standing
in
texas
now
which
is
in
one
claim
in
the
neighborhood
of
about
two
and
three-quarters
of
$1
million.
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
it
involves
a
land
trusted
debt
in
the
old
texas
septic
land
trust
which
was
an
offshoot
of
the
texas
septic
railroad.
and,
over
the
years,
it
has
--
mr.
w.
o.
shultz
ii
that
would
be,
in
our
experience
there,
the
only
--
i
don't
think,
no.
