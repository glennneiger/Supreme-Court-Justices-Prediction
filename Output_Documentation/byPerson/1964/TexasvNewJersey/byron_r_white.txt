justice
byron
r.
white
we
know
--
we
just
know
he's
out
of
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
don't
know
he's
not
in
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
isn't
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
his
actual
address?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
we
don't
have
his
address
–
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
tell
me,
under
the
statute
of
his
last
known
address,
how
do
you
determine
the
owner's
address?
justice
byron
r.
white
from
the
records.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
in
certain
things,
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
where
do
you
think
we
could
go?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
address
of
the
creditor
is
at
a
certain
address
on
some
street
in
some
city
and
the
letter
goes
there
and
then
it's
returned
because
he
isn't
there,
although
the
landlady
at
that
rooming
house
knows
exactly
where
he
is.
nevertheless,
it
goes
by
the
books
of
the
company.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
sheer
notice
to
the
creditor
is
no
more
than
credit
corporation
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
corporation
probably
sends
the
check
at
the
same
address.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
came
back.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
go
--
you
don't
write
a
letter
to
the
--
to
anybody.
you
just
put
it
in
a
sealed
envelope
and
you
never
find
--
you
never
try
to
trace
the
fellow
justice
byron
r.
white
the
letter
doesn't
--
if
the
letter
returns
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it's
unknown
--
if
the
state
mark
is
unknown.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
try
to
--
you
don't
try
to
send
it
to
the
district
attorney?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
maybe
every
other
state
is
--
maybe
the
state
of
the
last
known
address
might
go
through
the
equal
procedure
or
even
a
better
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
--
that
the
least
of
the
last
known
address
got
enough
substance
to
it,
that's
the
attorney
general
of
that
state
or
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
did
that
but
he
had
the
terms
of
the
creditors.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
get
--
i
agree,
but
if
there's
some
relevance
to
the
statement
of
that
state
of
the
last
known
address,
i
think,
might
have
substance.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
assume
though
that
if
--
i
would
assume
that
if
the
court
decided
to
say
that
the
last
known
address
is
to
have
it
--
then
the
state
of
new
jersey
would
take
the
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
--
well,
now,
i
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
sold.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
sold.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
florida
doing
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
all?
is
that
all,
just
the
publication?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
claim
--
florida's
claim
might
be
best
stated
as
a
state
most
likely
designed
to
be
creditor.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
address
--
the
lack
of
address
is
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
only
if
you
really
do
something
about
trying
to
find
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
money
is
really
his
not
the
state
of
florida.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you're
incentive
would
be
not
to
find
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
say
your
incentive
would
be
not
to
find
him
--
justice
byron
r.
white
because
if
you
did,
he'd
get
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that's
distinguished
between
the
states.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
are
your
procedures
just
to
--
how
placid
are
you
when
you
try
to
trace
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
ballard,
i
suppose
the
books
of
the
company,
is
rather
an
expensive
concept
anyway
and
it
might
mean
the
records
of
the
company,
any
of
the
records.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
might
have
on
your
books,
your
formal
books
of
account,
there
might
be
an
address
for
a
fellow
but
you've
kept
up
and
you
found
out
that,
well,
he
moved
to
so
and
so
in
the
course
of
your
investigation.
and
--
but,
you
go
to
that
address
and
he
isn't
there
either.
that
would
be
his
last
known
address,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
on
the
texas
matter,
you're
in
the
oil
business.
i
know
you
say
have
--
the
company
doesn't
have
a
stake
in
this,
but
what
do
you
think
about
the
--
i
mean,
why
shouldn't
texas
be
correct
in
saying
that
“look,
this
is
real
estate
under
our
law
and
only
the
state
of
--
where
the
real
estate
is
located
may
escheat
real
estate”?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
a
debt.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
real
estate
--
justice
byron
r.
white
anymore,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happens
in
life
insurance
companies?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
shouldn't
that
follow
no
matter
what
escheat
rule
you
call?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
just
an
argument
against
escheat
rather
than
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
on
the
book
that
says
that
it's
the
last
known
address
on
the
book
of
the
company.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
kehoe,
what
--
could
you
tell
me
what
the
--
do
you
have
any
idea
what
the
average
size
of
the
claim
is
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what's
the
largest?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
of
any
instances
in
your
experience
in
new
jersey
which
has
been
long
and
you
had
other
connections
with
this
problem?
what's
the
largest
escheatable
claim
you
ever
heard
of?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't
standard
oil
--
didn't
that
run
in
the
millions?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
single
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
an
oil
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
run
of
the
meal
claim,
you
suppose
that
it
averaged
$10
or
$20?
