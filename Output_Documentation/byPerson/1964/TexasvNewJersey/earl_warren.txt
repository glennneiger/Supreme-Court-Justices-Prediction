original,
state
of
texas,
plaintiff,
versus
the
state
of
the
new
jersey
et
al.
mr.
shultz.
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
shouldn't
our
solicitor
generally
be
before
the
true
owner
of
this
property,
the
creditor,
and
not
the
debtor
state
or
debtor
company
in
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
just
wondering
if
it
wouldn't
be
more
likely
to
be
served
then
if
we
did
follow
the
master
in
saying
that
the
last
known
address
of
the
creditor
is
one
who
should
determine
the
state
in
which
this
escheat
could
be
had
because
in
each
one
of
the
states
there
must
be
a
procedure.
it
might
not
be
more
likely
to
know
if
the
escheat
procedure
in
the
state
of
his
last
known
address
than
in
some
other
state
that
might
not
come
in
and
here
is
the
heirs
come
in
and
claim
the
property
rather
than
to
have
this
escheat
to
the
state
or
to
--
to
the
state,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
again,
when
you
talk
about
contacts,
it's
your
solicitor
for
the
state,
rather
than
with
the
creditor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
wouldn't
--
well,
i'm
just
inquiring.
i
made
up
my
own
mind
but
i'm
just
wondering
if
the
vital
contact
shouldn't
be
the
one
where
a
man's
last
residence
is
because
when
it
comes
to
escheating
of
a
property
of
a
state
he
might
have
a
better
opportunity
there
where
he's
more
likely
to
be
than
in
the
state
from
which
he
moved
or
never
was.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
know
how
you
divided
your
time.
i
see
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
time
for
adjournment.
yes,
indeed,
we'll
do
that.
mr.
shultz,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
would
be
more
likely
to
produce
the
most
litigation,
the
last
known
address
or
the
more
context?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
shultz.
mr.
kehoe.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
burns.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
when
it's
severed
from
its
oil.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
the
question
of
the
escheat
of
realty
that
way
would
not
arise
very
often,
would
it?
because
if
it
was
realty,
it
would
be
taxable
in
the
state
and
if
the
owner
didn't
pay
the
tax,
they'd
sell
it
for
texas
to
--
the
state
will
sell
it
for
texas,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
oman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
oman.
mr.
resnick.
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
filed
a
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ballard.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
ballard.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
burns,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kehoe.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
shultz,
do
you
have
something
further?
