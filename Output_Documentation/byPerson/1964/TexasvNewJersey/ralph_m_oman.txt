mr.
ralph
m.
oman
mr.
chief
justice
and
--
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
may
it
please
the
court.
my
time
is
short
and
i'll
try
not
to
use
it
all,
but
i'd
like
to
start
with
a
statement
that
i
believe
mr.
shultz
in
texas
made
to
the
effect
that
ruling
out
one
or
two
of
the
three
choices,
we
seem
to
have
as
to
the
adoption
of
a
standard
would
give
some
other
state
or
might
not
give
some
other
state
a
better
right
to
take,
and
my
next
cue
is
a
statement
by
mr.
chief
justice
warren
where
he
inquired
to
the
gentleman
as
to
where
the
solicitor
should
lie.
and,
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
your
honors
that,
as
i
view
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
western
union,
the
purpose
of
this
constitutionally
embodied
tribunal
under
its
constitutional
rights
to
determine
controversy
between
states
is
to
set
up
a
standard
or
a
test
of
some
kind
by
which
competing
states
may
be
gotten,
and
whether
you
call
it
arbitrary
or
not.
as
mr.
justice
black
said,
most
all
rules
of
law
are
arbitrary
but
they're
also
non-arbitrary
in
the
sense
that
they're
founded
on
something
early,
not
granted.
the
three
tests
proposed
here
and
claimed
by
the
various
states
may
not
be
the
best,
may
not
produce
the
finest
results,
but
i
think
it's
the
best
we
can
do.
the
master's
report
--
i
might
--
i'm
getting
little
ahead
of
myself.
we
were
given
permission
to
file
a
brief
amicus
here.
i
represent
the
life
insurance
association
of
america
which
is
composed
of
126
life
insurance
companies
writing
about
84%
of
the
legal
business
and
the
life
insurance
industry
has
a
tremendous
stake
in
this
very
problem
and
it
has
paid
for
years
on
the
basis
of
the
last
known
address.
it's
member
companies
have
paid
millions
of
dollars
and
also
--
to
the
states
and
have
paid
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
on
the
basis
of
the
last
known
address
where
it
used
that
as
a
starting
point
to
locate
people
who
had
unclaimed
funds.
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
that,
i
cannot
tell
you,
your
honor.
i
think
there's
some
history
of
litigation
for
some
of
the
states
but
i'd
rather
not
try
to
give
you
answer
on
that.
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
they
do.
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
they
make
an
effort
to
locate
even
after
they
had
made
reports
to
the
state.
they
are
first
required
to
make
reports
to
the
states
of
money
that
they
hold.
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
yes,
and
starting
at
the
most
natural
starting
point
in
the
world
which
is
the
last
known
address.
and,
i'd
like
to
submit
to
your
honors
this
question.
whenever
property
is
lost
or
unclaimed,
i
don't
want
to
say
abandoned
and
i
don't
want
to
say
ownerless,
but
whenever
a
property
is
sought
to
be
taken
by
someone
who
may
claim
to
be
a
finder
or
might,
even
in
the
case
of
states,
claim
to
be
entitled
to
it,
although
i
don't
know
where
their
right
comes
except
from
the
merit,
right,
and
privilege
of
their
sovereignty.
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
a
person's
mind
who
wants
to
make
a
bonafide
effort
to
find
the
owner
and
it's
the
owner's
property,
it
always
--
is
always
the
orders
about
it.
where
was
he
last?
where
was
he
known
to
have
lived?
where
was
he
known
to
have
resided?
where
did
he
have
an
address?
because
that
would
be
the
place
where
at
least
the
master
had
furnished
adequate
proof
of
the
location
of
the
property
an
intangible
within
the
state
where
he
was
last
known
to
have
resided.
in
this
very
lawsuit,
which
only
involved
some
$30,000
or
$40,000
held
or
paid
into
court
by
sun
oil,
there
has
been
over
$11,000
paid
out
of
these
funds
to
persons
who
have
been
located,
who
have
been
tracked
down
and
found
by
going
first
to
the
most
natural
starting
point
that
you
can
think
of,
and
that's
where
was
he
last
known
to
have
been
before
he
abandoned
the
property.
we
agree
wholeheartedly
with
the
master
that
the
so-called
contacts
principle,
contacts
with
the
transaction,
is
the
least
desirable.
it
--
in
my
opinion,
is
not
a
standard
at
all.
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
it
has.
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
i'd
like
to
say
at
this
point
--
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
i
--
well,
it's
not
the
--
i
don't
quite
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
if
used
in
that
sense,
it
is
the
finest
type
of
contact.
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
but,
the
contacts
theory,
principle
contacts
with
the
transaction,
which
new
jersey
claims
under,
principle
--
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
i
cannot
give
you
an
answer
on
that,
your
honor.
i
know
that
there
are
23
states.
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
and
there
has
been
one
added,
the
state
of
new
york,
since
this
law
suit
was
commenced.
it
amended
its
statute
to
come
under
the
last
known
address.
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
i'm
sorry,
but
i
do
not
know
and
i
cannot
give
you
that
answer.
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
according
to
the
records
and
books
of
the
company,
i
think
that's
the
way
the
statute
reads.
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
i
think
that
would
provide
a
starting
--
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
i
think
that
would
provide
a
starting
point.
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
i
don't
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
well,
it's
the
last
one
that
the
company
knew
about.
it
was
the
last
known
to
them.
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
it
would
be
the
last
--
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
no.
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
i
think
we'll
have
to
--
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
i
don't
think
we
need
to
let
any
more
in,
if
your
honors
please.
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
yes,
i
know
--
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
and,
i
don't
know
the
answer,
frankly.
i'm
inclined
to
--
i'm
not
saying
i'm
inclining
to
agree.
i
do
agree
with
judge
huxman
of
the
court.
i
think
he
has
ruled
out,
and
rightly
so,
the
so-called
sufficient
contacts
theory
because
that
is
not,
in
itself,
a
standard.
it
would
take
a
standard
to
determine
that
there's
a
standard.
what
is
sufficient
to
one
state
might
be
insufficient
to
another,
and
vice
versa.
and,
you
would
have
a
multitude
of
litigations
over
that
because
--
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
he
said
it
was
just
fact.
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
right.
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
not
the
creditor.
the
debtor
has
no
property
rights
into
this.
mr.
ralph
m.
oman
absolutely
and
it's
the
owner
that's
entitled
to
any
solicitude
as
far
as
selecting
an
arbitrary
standard
or
a
standard
or
a
guide,
if
one
can
be
selected.
i
think
the
owner
is
entitled
to
much
more
consideration
than
either
of
the
claiming
states
are
prone
to
giving
because
the
states
have
no
right
to
this
property
per
se.
it
isn't
their
property.
it's
a
windfall
for
them.
it's
a
method
of
enriching
their
treasury,
and
i
don't
say
that
they're
not
entitled
to
escheat
property
but
i
don't
think
they're
entitled
to
make
claim
to
it
under
the
so-called
sufficiency
of
the
contacts
theory
nor
the
domiciliary
theory,
which
of
course
only
takes
into
account
property
of
the
debtor.
and,
the
debtor
has
no
proprietary
interest
and
no
property
right
in
an
intangible.
it
belongs
to
the
creditor.
i
want
to
thank
mr.
burns
and
to
share
to
the
court
of
my
appreciation
is
being
submitted
to.
