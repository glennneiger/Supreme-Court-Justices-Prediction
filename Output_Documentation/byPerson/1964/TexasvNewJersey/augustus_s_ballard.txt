mr.
augustus
s.
ballard
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
we
come
at
last
to
the
custodian
of
the
fund.
at
the
outset
of
this
litigation,
in
which
we
are
a
named
defendant
but
have
no
real
interest
other
than
to
see
a
real
solution
to
this
problem,
we
took
the
position
that
we
could
neither
admit
nor
deny
the
status
of
the
property
here
sought
in
texas
or
in
any
other
state
which
was
then
a
party
to
the
proceeding
or
subsequently
became
one,
but
that
we
would
act
in
accordance
with
the
disposition
of
the
matter
as
dictated
by
this
court.
the
thing
that
has
concerned
us,
as
the
case
has
progressed,
is
that
in
considering
the
complex
theory
as
advanced
by
the
various
states
we,
as
the
custodian
of
the
property,
may
become
confused
as
to
what
we
are
supposed
to
do.
it
is
for
this
reason
that
we
are
somewhat
concerned
about
the
theory
advanced
by
the
state
of
texas
because
we
have
visions
of
our
comptroller
or
treasurer,
whoever
he
may
be
confronted
with
hundreds
of
these
transactions
every
year,
having
to
become
an
expert
in
the
conflict
of
laws
in
order
to
fill
out
the
various
reports.
the
theory
adopted
by
the
master
has
the
virtue,
from
our
standpoint,
of
being
understandable
and
easy
to
follow
even
though,
i
must
say,
that
it
is
not,
from
our
standpoint,
the
easiest
theory
which
could
be
adopted.
if
we
--
if
the
court
were
to
adhere
to
mr.
kehoe's
theory,
that
means
we've
got
only
one
state
to
worry
about
or
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
the
position
originally
taken
by
pennsylvania,
and
now
abandoned,
and
that
is
that
the
state
where
the
principal
office
of
the
debtor
is
concerned,
that
would
also
be
an
easy
rule
to
follow.
however,
except
for
the
caveat
of
making
constitutional
lawyers
out
of
companies
--
the
officials
of
companies
who
are
in
charge
of
filing
out
these
escheat
reports,
we
reiterate
our
position
that
we
have
no
axe
to
grind.
mr.
augustus
s.
ballard
yes,
sir.
mr.
augustus
s.
ballard
yes,
sir.
most,
i
think
that
it
might
be
well
to
clear
up
one
point,
a
doubt
that
has
arisen
here.
i
think
sun
oil
company
is
not
alone
in
preferring
to
pay
its
debts
to
the
people
it
owes
them
to
and
not
to
any
of
the
states,
however,
fond
we
may
be
of
them.
the
texas
law
was
passed
and
we
filed
a
report
in
complete
compliance
with
it.
and,
actually,
it
turned
out
that
we
were
able
to
find,
within
the
period
allowed
by
the
texas
statute,
various
people,
the
actual
owners
of
the
property.
the
--
mr.
augustus
s.
ballard
yes,
sir.
that
is
quite
true.
mr.
augustus
s.
ballard
it
depends
on
the
amount
and
the
type
of
obligation.
if
you
can't
find
the
stockholder,
you're
extremely
worried
and
you
would
follow
--
you
would
go
to
the
postmaster
in
his
hometown
or
whatever
might
be
an
appropriate
procedure.
if
you
owe
a
fellow
35
cents
for
a
bag
of
nails
in
a
hardware
store
and
you
send
him
a
check
and
he
doesn't
cash
it,
i
think
you
just
let
him
go
at
that.
you're
not
going
to
waste
your
time
pursuing
it.
but,
as
a
general
rule,
like
any
other
company,
it's
–
you
run
the
risk,
if
you
pay
over
to
a
state
of
the
true
owner
turning
up
and
wanting
his
money.
you
say
“i'm
sorry.
we've
paid
it
to
texas
or
new
jersey.”
it
doesn't
make
him
happy.
mr.
augustus
s.
ballard
what,
sir?
mr.
augustus
s.
ballard
royalty
payments?
the
royalty
payments,
again,
we
treat
with
special
care
because
they
touch
upon
realty
which
has
a
degree
of
formality
which
one
does
not
associate
with
personal
realty.
and,
it's
the
life
blood,
of
course
--
of
an
oil
company
that
its
arrangements
in
the
state
of
texas
and
elsewhere
where
it
has
oil
interests
must
be
right
up
to
the
mark,
and
we
avoid,
if
possible,
finding
the
situation
which
has
occurred.
we
cannot
find
the
person
who
owns
a
fractional
mineral
interest.
so,
i
--
mr.
augustus
s.
ballard
i
would
think
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
all
states
have
escheat
laws
of
one
kind
or
another,
but
that
the
number
of
the
states
having
these
omnibus
statutes
would
be
in
the
order
of
15
to
20.
when
i
say
omnibus
statutes,
i
mean
those
reaching
wages,
business
debts
of
all
kinds
and
that
kind
of
thing
and
not
merely
a
person's
dying
intestate
without
heir.
mr.
augustus
s.
ballard
then
we
are
enriched.
i
admit
it.
we
would
then
be
enriched.
conversely,
if
we're
a
new
jersey
corporation
and
you've
gathered
from
mr.
kehoe
that
they
have
a
very
active
escheat
program,
but
if
you
adopt
a
state
of
incorporation
rule,
i
don't
believe
delaware
has
an
omnibus
escheat
statute
and,
of
course,
there
are
more
corporations
incorporated
in
delaware
than
any
other
state.
i
think
that
whatever
formula
you
come
out
with,
in
some
cases,
the
debtor,
the
holder,
is
going
to
benefit
but
i
also
think
that
that
is
what
is
motivating
us.
we
are
looking
a
role
--
mr.
augustus
s.
ballard
most
of
them
do
have
--
some
of
them
have,
actually,
as
i
recall
it,
a
perpetual
holding
period
that
there
is
no
bar
that
the
true
owner
coming.
i
might
mention
that,
since
this
action
began
and
although
it's
been
general
knowledge
that
it's
pending,
sun
oil
company
has
been
asked
by
15
states
to
file
reports
and
we
have
filed
those
reports.
we
have
denied
--
we
have
refused
to
pay
anybody
because
we
don't
know
who
to
pay,
but
it
gives
you
an
idea
of
the
complexity
of
this
problem
just
taking
one
company
alone.
mr.
augustus
s.
ballard
well,
i
repeat,
your
honor,
we're
looking
for
--
mr.
augustus
s.
ballard
well
that
might
well
be.
certainly,
we
are
doing
our
best
to
find
them.
mr.
augustus
s.
ballard
in
taking
debtors
generally,
if
you
take
a
last
known
address
rule
such
as
the
master
has
here,
and
we've
got
a
creditor
whose
last
known
address
is
north
dakota
and
let's
assume
for
the
moment,
and
i
think
this
is
true,
that
north
dakota
has
no
omnibus
escheat
act
which
would
reach
unclaimed
wages.
as
i
understand,
the
workings
of
the
master's
rule,
we
don't
have
to
report
that
to
anyone
unless
or
until
the
state
of
north
dakota
adopts
an
omnibus
escheat
bill.
not
all
the
states
have
the
same
kind
or
as
broad
as
the
states
actually
concerned
in
this
case
all
have
far-reaching
escheat
statute.
mr.
augustus
s.
ballard
that
corporation
would
make
out
well.
mr.
augustus
s.
ballard
i'm
not
suggest
--
i'm
not
presuming
to
interject
our
feelings
on
it,
other
than
to
say
--
mr.
augustus
s.
ballard
well,
i
think,
actually
--
mr.
augustus
s.
ballard
the
fair
--
from
a
standpoint
of
fairness,
i
think
judge
huxman
has
found
the
fairest
rule,
assuming
again
that
you
can't
be
absolutely
sure
of
fairness.
while
it
is
true
that
the
last
known
address
on
our
books
may
indicate
he's
not
there
anymore
and
it
may
not
even
have
been
his
residence,
it
is
nevertheless
the
address
which
the
creditor
gave
to
sun
oil
company
in
transacting
whatever
particular
piece
of
business
it
happened
to
be,
stock
ownership,
wages,
sale
of
supplies,
whatever
it
happened
to
be.
and,
i
think
that
it
--
this
really,
it
makes
better
sense
for
that
state
where
his
last
known
address
was
to
claim
the
money,
then
the
state
of
incorporation
which
may
have
had
very
little
or
no
connection
with
the
transaction
whatsoever.
mr.
augustus
s.
ballard
i
think
the
last
known
address
according
to
the
books
of
the
company
will
do
for
the
reason
that
there
is
no
impetus
on
the
company
to
hide
it
and,
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
an
impetus
to
keep
it
current
because,
as
i
say,
the
company
will
want
to
pay
the
creditor.
it's
not
going
to
sit
there
and
let
the
last
known
address
become
a
stale
one
and
i
venture
to
suggest
that,
at
least
as
far
as
my
plan
is
--
mr.
augustus
s.
ballard
i
suppose
any
assumptions
are
dangerous
but,
generally
speaking,
the
escheatable
abandoned
property
is
so
little
in
amount
that
you
--
there
is
no
--
the
game
wouldn't
be
worth
it.
the
company
would
rather
discharge
its
debts
in
the
course
of
its
regular
business
and
keep
its
address
list
up
to
date.
mr.
augustus
s.
ballard
yes,
sir.
mr.
augustus
s.
ballard
that's
right
and,
as
i
say,
depending
upon
the
nature
of
the
debt,
the
efforts
to
keep
that
current
will
vary
and
--
mr.
augustus
s.
ballard
well,
without
expressing
an
expert
opinion
on
the
mineral
oil
law
of
texas,
i
venture
this.
that
the
time
--
by
the
time
it
comes
to
where
we
consider
it
abandoned.
it's
reduced
to
a
sum
of
money
--
a
specific
sum
of
money.
mr.
augustus
s.
ballard
it's
a
debt
and
that's
--
that
would
be
our
view.
mr.
augustus
s.
ballard
it's
not
real
estate.
mr.
augustus
s.
ballard
thank
you.
