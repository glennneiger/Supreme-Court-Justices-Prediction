mr.

mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
florida
contends
for
the
theory
that
the
state
of
the
last
known
address
should
--
is
the
one
that's
entitled
to
these
properties.
now,
whether
we
proceed
on
a
theory
of
escheat
or
proceed
on
the
theory
of
custodial
laws,
in
either
case,
more
than
one
state
very
likely
will
be
laying
plain
to
the
identical
properties.
in
this
case,
the
state
of
texas,
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
the
state
of
new
jersey
are
laying
claim
to
the
same
properties
and
florida
is
laying
claim
to
the
intangibles
belonging
to
people
whose
last
known
address
was
in
florida.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
that's
the
extent
of
our
claim.
it's
the
last
known
address.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
people
whose
last
known
address
was
in
florida.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
on
the
books
of
the
company.
but
--
a
primary
evidence,
i
guess
you
have
of
the
last
known
address
would
be
on
the
books
of
the
company.
now,
we
think
--
mr.
fred
m.
burns
well
--
mr.
fred
m.
burns
i
am
kindly
inclined
to
the
view
that
the
better
rule
there
might
be
to
follow
the
presumption
that
the
people
who
had
no
address
on
the
books
lived
at
the
place
where
the
obligation
accrued.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
domicile
of
the
debtor
or,
if
the
record
shows,
that
the
contract
was
entered
into
in
a
particular
state
than
in
that
state.
now
that
would
raise
as
a
presumptive
last
known
address,
but
i
see
a
difficulty
in
trying
to
arrive
at
a
definite
rule
after
that
because
you've
got
no
last
known
address
anywhere,
not
even
on
the
books
of
the
company.
so,
i
think
we
might
indulge
in
the
presumption
that
the
creditor
lived
in
the
neighborhood
where
the
claim
accrued.
now,
that
seems
to
be
the
best
instruction
i
could
put
on
that.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
well,
i
don't
know
if
anybody
would
probably
know
at
the
present
time,
but
i
believe
we
have
a
rule
of
law
that
a
person's
address
is
at
one
place,
it's
presumed
to
be
there
until
some
evidence
is
shown
that
it's
been
moved.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
well,
then
i
guess
you're
going
to
have
to
go
back
to
new
jersey's
claim
of
the
--
mr.
fred
m.
burns
domicile
of
the
owner.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
because
i
think
it
would
be
presumed
that
if
you
had
no
other
evidence
of
a
place
where
the
claim
accrued,
it
would
be
at
the
domicile
of
the
person
who
--
mr.
fred
m.
burns
yes.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
that
--
mr.
fred
m.
burns
i
think
--
mr.
fred
m.
burns
i
think
those
gas
interests,
my
view
on
that
is,
as
long
as
the
interest
of
the
amount
to
be
paid
has
not
accrued,
i
think
it
is
probably
an
interest
in
real
estate.
but,
when
that
money
has
accrued
on
the
obligations,
then
i
think
it
becomes
then
an
intangible
and
not
a
part
of
the
real
estate.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
well,
i
don't
know
about
texas
law.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
when
it's
severed
from
its
oil,
free
from
the
drill.
when
the
oil
--
mr.
fred
m.
burns
well,
that
would
seem
to
me,
we
have
a
better
rule
on
or
you've
got
conflicts
of
laws
between
states
and
where
this
money
becomes
new.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
if
--
if
you've
got
a
lease
on
an
acre
of
ground
in
texas,
an
oil
lease,
and
oil
is
discovered
on
that
lease,
on
that
one
acre
of
ground,
then
i
think
the
oil
interest
or
the
interests
are
real
estate
until
the
oil
and
gas
has
been
separated
and
taken
from
the
ground.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
sir?
mr.
fred
m.
burns
and
sold,
yes.
it's
taken
from
the
ground
and
sold,
and
then
it
becomes
an
obligation
--
an
intangible
obligation.
but,
it
seems
to
me,
well,
that,
that
would
be
the
better
rule
to
follow
in
the
matters
of
that
kind
because
we've
--
in
most
cases
they,
like
oil
and
gas
and
coal
and
so
forth,
are
considered
as
part
of
the
real
estate
until
severed.
so,
i
believe
that
that
would
be
the
better
rule
to
follow
as
to
those.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
well,
i'm
inclined
to
think
that
probably
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
between
the
states
and
that
because,
in
some
states,
as
in
florida,
the
taxes
are
on
the
property
itself
irrespective
of
the
interest
in
the
properties.
although,
we
do
have
two
or
three
instances
where
at
least
a
whole
interest
can
be
assessed,
but
that
has
only
been
in
recent
years.
now,
i
don't
know
what
type
of
a
rule
we
may
have
in
other
states.
and,
in
florida,
up
until
within
recent
years,
the
tax
is,
well,
assessed
against
the
real
estate
and
not
against
the
owner
but
the
real
estate
itself.
and,
that
was
true
irrespective
of
the
number
of
least
a
whole
interest
in
it.
so,
in
that
state,
and
i
don't
believe
he's
in
the
--
there
may
be
a
rule
now
on
recent
law
but,
in
that
state,
the
owner
of
the
real
estate
would
have
to
pay
the
taxes
to
protect
his
real
estate.
now,
the
owner
of
a
least
whole
interest
might've
had
to
pay
to
keep
somebody
else
from
getting
it,
but
we
did
not
have
separate
assessments
for
the
oil
interest
and
the
remainder
until
--
in
recent
years.
so
that,
in
texas,
a
judge,
from
his
argument,
that
has
not
--
amend
the
rule
out
there.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
well,
if
you're
going
to
consider
debts
being
an
intangible
that
follows
the
owner
of
the
debt,
then
we
may
run
into
some
interstate
trouble
on
that.
and,
it's
--
mr.
fred
m.
burns
well,
a
lot
--
mr.
fred
m.
burns
well,
i
don't
know
that
you
could
say
that
debts
would
always
be
real
estate
even
if
we're
out
of
real
estate
because
--
mr.
fred
m.
burns
i
think
maybe
--
mr.
fred
m.
burns
i
don't
think
so.
if
the
rule
is
as
if
there
maybe
--
that
intangibles
have
their
status
not
at
the
place
where
they
owed,
that
in
the
place
where
the
person
lives
that
they
owed
to.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
now,
i
think
very
properly
that
a
state
might
have
the
authority
to
rule
that
all
debts
--
pass
a
law
that
all
debts
drawn
out
of
an
oil
lease
in
that
state
should
be
considered
real
estate
as
to
all
debts
drawn
out
of
oil
interest
after
the
passage
of
the
act
itself.
but,
that
gave
me
considerable
trouble
as
to
this.
what
the
status
of
those
interests
are?
mr.
fred
m.
burns
well,
the
trouble
is
that
debts
are,
in
some
instances,
debts
arising
in
florida
are
debts
owing
to
somebody
else
in
another
state
and
may
not
even
arise
altogether
in
florida
that
this
corporation
is
doing
business
between
a
number
of
states.
well,
part
of
the
transaction
arose
in
florida
and
the
balance
of
it
arose
in
texas.
so,
i
don't
know
just
how
much
trouble
you
would
have
working
out
a
uniform
law
that
could
applicable
in
all
instances.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
i'm
very
doubtful
about
it.
it
might
be
done
but,
at
the
present
time,
i'm
doubtful
that
you
can
work
out
a
law
in
texas
that
would
be
binding
on
49
other
states.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
yes,
because
these
--
mr.
fred
m.
burns
well,
the
only
rule
that
i
can
see
that
you
might
possibly
adopt
with
a
reasonable
certainty
would
be
the
rule
of
the
--
that
an
intangible
like
a
debt
has
its
status
in
the
state
where
the
person
it
owed
to
lived.
now,
that's
what
you
were
trying
to
stay
away
from.
that's
about
the
only
one
that
i
could
think
of
that
--
mr.
fred
m.
burns
well,
that's
the
problem.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
that's
serious
problem.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
that's
a
practical
problem,
too.
but,
being
and
considering
how
you
can
treat
it,
we
get
back
to
the
status
--
mr.
fred
m.
burns
which
is
--
mr.
fred
m.
burns
you
might
have
--
mr.
fred
m.
burns
well
--
mr.
fred
m.
burns
well,
you
would
have
to
make
some
new
laws.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
i
think
it'd
have
to
be
viewed
--
mr.
fred
m.
burns
i
think
it'd
have
to
be
a
new
law.
some
of
the
states
had
a
conference
here
a
few
years
ago
to
try
to
work
out
something
on
this
and
indeed
we
go
forward
with.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
now,
that's
--
it
followed
it
to
florida.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
and
left
it
there
when
they
disappeared.
in
other
words,
when
the
debt
accrued
--
mr.
fred
m.
burns
they
may
still
be
in
florida,
for
all
we
know.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
well,
they
usually
publish
a
list
in
the
newspapers,
i
believe,
where
it's
being
done
under
the
new
law.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
well,
the
controller
is
administering
that.
i'm
not
fully
acquainted
as
to
what
else
is
done.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
well,
i
think
--
mr.
fred
m.
burns
yes,
i
think
that
would
be
true.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
if
that's
--
mr.
fred
m.
burns
it's
--
it
belongs
to
a
creditor.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
your
what?
mr.
fred
m.
burns
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
yes.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
it
might
be.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
no.
that's
distinguished
between
the
states.
mr.
fred
m.
burns
they
might.
i
wish
to
surrender
the
balance
of
my
time
to
mr.
oman
to
discuss
the
--
