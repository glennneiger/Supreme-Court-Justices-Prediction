mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
action,
this
court
is
being
called
upon
for
the
first
time
to
decide
what
rule
of
law
should
be
adopted
where
there
is
a
conflict
between
states
who
seek
to
take
intangibles
which
have
been
unclaimed
from
a
corporation
incorporated
in
one
state
and
doing
business
in
many
other
states.
new
jersey
commenced
an
action
against
the
sun
oil
company
in
september
of
1961
under
the
new
jersey
custodial
escheat
law
and,
while
that
action
was
pending,
in
november,
texas
enacted
an
escheat
statute
and
then
commenced
an
action
in
this
court
to
restrain
the
taking
by
new
jersey
of
the
intangibles
from
the
sun.
this
brought
before
the
court
the
question
of
which
state
should
take
so
that
the
holder
of
the
intangibles
will
properly
be
protected
in
his
constitutional
rights.
the
history
of
the
activity
of
the
states
in
this
field
commenced,
so
far
as
litigation
is
concerned,
to
some
degree
back
in
1923
with
the
security
savings
bank
versus
california
where
the
right
of
the
state
of
california
to
take
unclaimed
bank
deposits
was
sustained.
and
then,
we
went
on
into
connecticut
mutual
life
versus
moore
where
unclaimed
life
insurance
funds
were
held
to
be
taken
--
to
be
subject
to
custodial
taking
by
the
state
of
new
york
where
the
policies
had
been
delivered
in
new
york
on
the
lives
of
residents
of
new
york.
and
then,
we
went
on
to
the
standard
oil
case
where
it
was
held
that
the
state
of
incorporation
could
escheat
the
shares
of
stock
and
the
dividends
payable
there
under.
in
all
of
these
cases,
the
question
before
the
court
was
the
power
of
the
state
to
take
from
the
holder.
the
state
reserved
the
question
expressly
in
at
least
two
of
the
cases
where
a
claim
would
be
made
by
another
state,
and
then
we
had
western
union
versus
pennsylvania,
which
was
decided
by
this
court
in
1961,
where
pennsylvania
sought
to
escheat
unclaimed
intangibles
held
by
western
union,
a
new
york
corporation
doing
business
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
and,
there,
the
court
held
that
the
state
of
pennsylvania
could
not
take
unless
it
could
protect
the
holder
from
double
liability,
and
we
look
at
this
case
as
that
is
the
question
before
the
court.
how
can
this
court
best
protect
a
holder
from
double
liability?
the
master,
in
his
report,
suggested
a
standard
of
last
known
address
with
a
right
to
the
state
of
incorporation
to
take
under
a
custodial
statute
where
there
were
not
any
last
known
addresses.
in
the
hearing
before
the
master,
new
jersey
urged
that
the
master
adopt
a
standard
of
state
of
corporate
domicile.
now,
the
reason
we
urged
that
was
because,
in
this
area
which
new
jersey
has
had
considerable
experience,
we
find
that
when
you
commence
an
action
against
the
corporation
they
are
compelled
to
go
into
their
rather
ancient
records
and
the
facts
which
might
be
available
to
help
on
a
context
theory
were
not
readily
available.
for
example,
in
this
case,
some
of
the
claims
are
40
years
old.
some
of
the
claims
in
value
vary
from
one
penny
to
several
hundred
dollars.
the
only
facts
which
we
could
prepare
for
presentation
to
the
master
were
a
stipulation
of
very
general
facts.
we
stipulated
that
there
were
claims
payable
by
the
corporation.
we
stipulated
that
the
southwest
division
in
texas
does
have
some
autonomy
in
its
activities.
of
course,
we
couldn't
stipulate
that
any
one
of
those
particular
claims
resulted
from
a
man
who
was
hired
in
texas
on
such
and
such
a
day
who
worked
in
louisiana
on
such
and
such
a
day
because
those
facts
are
not
available.
and,
that
is
interesting
only
because
it
shows
the
general
picture
which
a
state
is
confronted
with
or
a
holder
is
confronted
with
or
a
court
is
confronted
with
in
passing
on
a
question
of
this
nature.
and
if
you
adopt
a
standard
of
state
of
incorporation
for
taking
from
the
holder,
i
think
that
would
be
the
simplest
and
the
most
certain
and
the
easiest
rule
for
both
the
corporation
of
the
states.
we
concede
that
there
may
be
situations
where
equity
would
require
that
a
claim
should
go
to
a
state
other
than
the
state
of
incorporation.
well,
if
that
is
so,
the
state
making
such
a
claim
would
have
to
press
its
claim
against
the
state
of
incorporation
and,
if
they
present
a
case
--
a
factual
case
which
comes
within
the
standard
which
would
permit
a
second
state
to
take
from
the
state
of
incorporation,
then
the
state
of
incorporation
would
have
to
pay
them.
but,
at
least
so
far
as
the
holder
was
concerned,
he
would
be
protected
from
being
sued
by
any
other
state
and
we
feel
that
a
precedent
has
been
established
for
this
holding
in
the
standard
oil
case.
in
the
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
well,
the
chief
executive
office
presently
exists
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
it
is
true.
i
didn't
--
the
only
point
i
wanted
to
make
there,
justice
goldberg,
was
the
fact
that
the
exact
facts
are
not
available,
no
place.
it
was
available
in
texas.
they
are
not
available
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
they're
not
available.
that's
what
creates
the
problem,
that
they're
not
available.
so,
how
can
we
say
that
if
this
happened
in
texas,
this
happened
in
pennsylvania?
we
don't
know
where
it
happened.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
now,
that
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
well,
that
was
the
--
what
the
master
reported.
we
never
had
that
in
the
trial
of
the
case
and
i
disagree
with
that
because
while
there's
$15
billion
available,
incidentally
the
source
of
that
is
an
article
in
the
wall
street
journal
and
how
the
man
in
the
wall
street
journal
got
his
news,
he
calls
up
to
various
states
because
he
called
me
up
and,
he
--
from
that,
he
writes
this
article.
and,
of
course,
he's
got
a
lot
of
news
value
when
he
says
15
billion
and
$1
billion
a
year,
but
i
can
tell
you
that,
from
our
experience,
the
tenor
of
a
trend
is
downward
and
not
upward.
and,
you
will
see,
once
the
problems
that
now
exist
in
this
field
are
resolved,
there's
going
to
be
a
considerable
decrease
in
the
amount
of
unclaimed
funds.
and,
i
question
seriously
whether
we're
dealing
with
$15
billion.
i
don't
think
we
are.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
master,
in
his
report,
i
think
he
was
persuaded
very
much
by
that
factor
because
he
said
it
would
be
inequitable
for
certain
states
that
incorporate
to
take
this
huge
sum
of
money
and,
certainly,
it
would
be
inequitable
when
you're
dealing
with
what
you're
dealing
with
in
this
case.
you
start
off
at
$30,000
with
wages
of
about
$26,000.
we've
got
1,700
claims.
i
mean
you've
got
a
claim
for
5
cents,
what
are
you
going
to
do?
see
where
this
fellow
bought
the
material.
maybe
he
bought
a
lead
pencil
some
place.
where
did
he
buy
it,
louisiana
or
texas?
i
mean,
you
get
to
a
point
where
you've
got
to,
we
think,
adopt
some
rule
which,
at
least
initially,
will
set
a
standard
for
taking
from
the
holder.
now,
if
you
want
to
go
beyond
that
and
you
want
to
say
that
if
a
man
was
hired
in
texas
and
he
earned
his
wages
in
texas
and
he
was
last
heard
of
in
texas,
and
texas
should
get
that
money,
well,
then
it
would
seem,
after
it's
taken
from
the
holder,
texas
would
present
its
claim.
and,
of
course,
if
that
standard
was
once
set,
we
would
pay
or
the
state
of
incorporation,
whichever
–-
it's
just
that
we
only
argue
for
the
state
of
incorporation
because
of
the
fact
that
it's
a
simple
rule
today
and
new
jersey
may
benefit
in
dollars
and
cents,
but
the
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
right.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
right,
except
of
course,
there,
we
know
he's
not
in
that
state
anymore.
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case
show
very
clearly
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
right.
we
know
he's
out
of
a
state.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
we
don't
know
he's
not
at
that
state.
that's
right.
that's
correct.
and,
if
you
want
to
say
--
if
you
want
to
find,
of
course
the
master
didn't
make
a
finding
of
that,
that
a
person
moves,
changes
address,
he's
still
in
the
state,
of
course
i
can't
argue
with
you
on
that
but
i
don't
think
that's
been
developed
by
this
record.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
well,
there
is
a
last
known
address
but
we
don't
know
where
he
is
now.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
right,
but
we
talk
about
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
we
don't
know
his
actual
address,
but
we
do
know
his
last
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
right.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
right.
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
well,
you
don't
have
an
address
because
he's
not
there,
right?
that's
why
you
don't
have
an
address.
but
--
and,
of
course,
the
underlying
theory
of
this
taking
property
is
the
fact
that
it's
not
wanted.
historically,
under
the
common
law
doctrine
of
bona
vacantia,
it's
ownerless
property
and
of
course
property,
once
being
ownerless,
can
be
taken
by
the
sovereign
for
the
benefit
of
all
of
the
citizens.
i
mean,
that's
a
very
proper
standard.
the
only
question
here
is
where
is
the
property?
which
sovereign
is
going
to
take?
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
from
the
records
of
the
corporation.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
right.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
well,
i
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
right.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
we
--
the
only
way
we
could
go
by
it
is
the
reports
of
the
corporation.
we
just
--
we
sue
a
corporation,
they
report
to
us
“we
owe
xyz,
22
smith
street,
jamaica
and
new
york
25
cents,
$1,
whatever
it
may
be.”
and,
we
take
that
as
a
report.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
right.
it's
all
we've
got.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
no
question
about
it.
but
just
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
it
depends
on
the
statute.
in
new
jersey,
what
we
do,
we
take
custody
of
a
claim
if
it's
unclaimed
for
five
successive
years.
then
we
hold
it
for
--
we
take
custody
of
it
then
we
send
them
a
notice
by
mail
to
the
last
known
address
and,
also,
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
if
the
address
is
outside
new
jersey.
and
then,
after
that
notice
is
sent,
we
wait
for
a
period
of
two
years
to
give
them
an
opportunity
to
claim.
and,
after
that
two-year-period,
we
then
proceed
to
escheat
the
funds
which
the
state
treasurer
still
holds.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
well,
we
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
we
don't
know.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
we
don't
know
what
the
facts
on
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
we
send
a
letter
or
we
do
pay
out
about
15
to
20%
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
15
to
20%
we
pay
just
when
we
send
our
letter
out.
the
corporation
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
if
the
letter
returns
to
us
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
we
can't
do
anything,
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
no,
we
don't.
we
do
send
a
notice
to
the
state
--
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
if
the
address
is
outside
the
state,
for
example,
these
claims
in
texas.
if
new
jersey
comes
there
to
take
custody,
we
will
send
a
complete
list
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
texas
when
we
mail
a
notice
to
those
people
whose
last
known
address
is
in
texas.
now,
if
he
wants
to,
and
we
have
some
attorney
generals
that
do,
the
attorney
general
of
ohio
for
example,
he
does
it
as
a
public
relations
angle.
he
tries
to
appeal
--rallies
people
up.
if
he
rallies
them
up
and
he
comes
in
with
them,
we
pay
them.
we're
happy
to
pay
them.
so,
under
the
statutory
program
procedure
in
new
jersey,
we
do
make
a
reasonable
effort
to
locate
these
people.
it's
not
simply
a
question
of
a
state
of
incorporation
taking
the
money
and
holding
on
to
it.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
they
might
very
well,
but
we
say
the
state
of
last
known
address,
it's
got
no
substance
like
the
state
of
incorporation.
we
know
the
state
where
he's
incorporated.
we
know
that
he's
there.
the
state
of
last
known
address,
i
think,
you
can
presume
he
severed
his
connection
at
least
with
the
address
and
maybe
with
the
state.
i
mean,
it's
just
not
a
supporting
standard
in
this
type
of
claim,
you
may
get
into
another
type
of
claim
which
last
known
address
maybe
a
satisfactory
standard.
now,
the
reason
that
i
say
that
and
i'm
trying
to
admit
to
the
court
that
in
new
jersey,
with
unclaimed
life
insurance
funds,
we
use
the
last
known
address
there.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
right.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
right.
what
else
are
we
going
to
do?
i
mean
this
--
you
get
into
a
program
like
this
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
well,
it's
got
some
substance.
i
don't
disagree
with
that,
justice
white,
but
i
think
when
you
have
to
choose
between
the
two,
and
especially
keeping
in
mind
that
you
want
to
protect
the
corporation
from
double
liability,
you
would
be
better
off,
we
think,
despite
the
state
of
corpus
domicile.
of
course
another
problem
with
the
last
known
address,
suppose
the
corporation
isn't
in
the
state.
take
public
service.
new
jersey
got
a
stockholder
in
texas.
how
is
texas
ever
going
to
get
that
unclaimed
dividend
from
the
public
service
of
new
jersey?
they
do
business
only
in
new
jersey.
surely,
the
texas
law
is
not
going
to
be
applicable,
i
don't
think,
to
the
corporation
exclusively
within
new
jersey.
so,
you've
got
a
situation
there
where
you
can't
say
that
this
is
the
stand
--
we
don't
think
that
this
the
standard
in
this
case
which
must
be
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
i
don't
even
question
on
that.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
i
mean,
would
it
be
that
if
you
--
that
you
--
if
you,
gentlemen,
decide
the
last
known
address,
it's
the
last
known
address.
we'd
be
satisfied
to
have
a
workable
rule,
but
what
we
are
trying
to
say
is
that
we
think
there's
more
substance
to
the
state
of
corporate
domicile
than
there
is
to
the
last
known
address.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
the
last
known
a
--
well,
they
probably
wouldn't
pay
to
the
state
of
texas,
i
would
imagine.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
right,
but
i
think
maybe
we
might
take
event
from
the
state
of
corporation
because
this
problem
only
comes
because
--
before
this
court
because
there's
a
conflict.
i
mean
absent
the
conflict,
all
the
states
were
taking
from
the
corporations
with
the
contact
that
they
might
have
had
but,
now,
we've
got
the
conflict
and
it
was
inevitable.
i
remember,
i
argued
a
case
before
justice
brennan
in
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
and
he
asked
that
question
11
years
ago,
12
years
ago.
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
two
states?
enforcing,
i
said
it
would
be
an
original
action
in
the
supreme
courts.
i
was
at
least
right
on
that
point.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
well,
when
you
get
into
why
it's
fairer,
it's
a
very
broad,
broad
question
but
we
think
it's
fairer
because
it's
easier
for
the
corporation.
it's
easier
for
the
corporation.
the
corporation
can
report
to
one
state.
it's
subjected
only
to
a
limited
amount
of
activity
and
it's
fairer
because
we
feel
that
it's
a
rule
under
the
new
jersey
law
which
permits
the
state
of
new
jersey
to
notify
these
people
if
they
can
be
found
at
the
last
known
address
that
they
had
some
money
and
if
they
don't
have
any
money
--
i
mean,
if
they
don't
have
any
claim
or
they
can't
be
found
at
that
address
then,
of
course,
you
eliminate
the
last
known
address
state.
so,
in
a
question
of
fairness,
we
think
that
that
is
as
good
a
rule
as
any.
now,
of
course
when
you
get
into
fairer,
the
other
states
are
going
to
say
it's
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
well
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
well,
the
company
has,
we
feel,
no
moral
or
legal
right
to
it
and
we
think
that's
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
it
sure
does.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
no,
question
about
it.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
sure.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
as
between
the
corporation
and
a
state,
any
state,
we
think,
has
a
paramount
of
right
because,
while
it's
holding
it,
it's
using
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
citizens.
in
other
words,
they
keep
a
fund.
most
of
these
programs,
they
take
75%
of
the
general
treasury
and
25%
to
repay
claims.
so,
they're
using
the
money
for
the
benefit
of
the
citizens
and
that,
historically,
is
the
doctrine
of
bona
vacantia
where
the
ownerless
property
is
used
by
the
sovereign
for
the
benefit
of
the
citizens.
that's
the
theory.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
the
citizens
of
the
sovereign
that
takes.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
well,
i
wouldn't
say
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
forgetting
the
sovereign?
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
well,
under
our
theory
that
it's
ownerless
property,
nobody.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
if
there's
an
owner,
no
question
about
that.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
right
and
if
you
have
a
simple
plan
for
tracing
the
owner,
then
you've
got
the
answer
but
there
is
no
simple
plan.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
yes,
but
i
think
we're
confusing
two
things,
paying
him
back
and
the
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
he
live
--
well,
we
don't
know
where
he
lives.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
well,
if
we
know
that,
yes,
if
we
know
that
but
we
don't
know
that.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
right.
well,
we
don't
know
that.
we
know
that
when
they
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
well,
i
think
it
would
be
safe
to
assume
that.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
right,
but
they
might
have
moved
to
new
jersey.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
well,
of
course,
insurance
claims
we
don't
have
involved
in
this.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
well,
it
is,
but
not
particularly
in
this
case,
at
least
that's
our
position.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
well
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
well,
that,
of
course
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
right,
but
that's
what
eggs
to
the
pot
that
we've
got
boiling.
we've
got
all
of
these
going.
what
standard
are
we
going
to
adopt
which
is
supported
as
a
legal
principle,
not
only
because
we
provide
a
--
what
might
be
an
equitable
distribution
today,
but
what
is
supported
by
law?
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
you
mean
federal
statute?
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
no,
there
is
no
federal.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
right.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
right
and
the
question
is
what
--
you're
going
to
protect
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
holder.
that's
really
how
this
question
came
before
the
court.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
the
holder.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
well,
i
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
right.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
well,
i
suppose
you
could
do
it
that
way
but
i
certainly
wouldn't.
even
out
of,
say,
texas
or
florida
or
somebody
else
got
it
before
you
come
to
that
conclusion.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
right.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
well,
that
might
be,
but
not
in
the
--
the
number
of
corporations,
of
course,
are
expanding
and,
simply,
delaware
is
the
highest
and
i
think
new
york
is
the
second,
new
jersey
third,
illinois,
california,
florida,
nevada,
they're
all
coming
along.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
maine?
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
i
don't
think
maine
was
on
the
list,
not
with
the
big
ones
anyway.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
right.
the
law
of
--
now,
there's
only
one
other
question
that
i
would
like
to
treat
before
i
conclude
and
that
is
the
procedural
question
we
offered
in
evidence
before
the
master
listed
the
report.
he
didn't
think
it
was
necessary
for
the
case.
we
think
it
is
and
we
ask
the
court
to
permit
that
evidence.
we
--
in
summary,
we
feel
that
when
you
look
at
the
type
of
a
problem
we
have
here
and
when
you
consider
the
standards
which
are
available
for
adoption,
we
think
that
by
the
process
of
elimination
--
we
think
the
contacts
theory
is
the
least
desirable.
we
agree
with
the
master
in
that
respect
because
i
don't
see
how
you
can,
for
a
(inaudible),
assemble
all
of
the
contacts
and
decide
that
the
question
should
be
passed
on,
on
contacts.
we
disagree
with
the
last
known
address
because
we
say
that
the
last
known
address
in
claims
of
this
nature
shows
that
he's
not
--
no
longer
present
at
that
address.
mr.
chief
justice
--
excuse
me?
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
the
copy
of
the
report
--
when
this
case
was
brought
before
the
--
we
also
offered
some
judgments
of
the
state
of
new
jersey.
we've
sent
them
on
to
the
court
in
the
court's
to
list
it.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
about
three
or
four
minutes
to
answer
the
amicus
in
case
he
raises
something
out
of
it.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
yes,
chief
justice,
may
i
--
i
think
i
reserved
a
couple
of
minutes.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
i'm
mr.
kehoe.
if
--
we
just
like
to
say
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
yes.
on
the
last
known
address
standard,
that
one
question
which
we
don't
want
to
lose
sight
of,
and
all
this
property
is,
if
this
court
adopts
that
rule
and
a
state
escheats
it
on
the
basis
of
last
known
address
and,
later
on,
the
creditor
should
come
and
sue
the
company,
the
company
is
not
going
to
be
protected
from
double
liability
which,
of
course,
is
the
objective
of
this
court,
we
think,
in
this
action.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
in
life
insurance
companies,
the
statute
that
i
am
aware
of
are
all
strictly
custodial
in
nature
and
he
can
get
it
back
at
anytime.
even
if
the
--
if
he
sued
the
life
insurance
company
and
he
got
a
judgment
against
another
new
jersey
statute,
new
jersey
would
pay
the
life
insurance
company
back.
that's
just
custodial,
not
escheat.
but,
under
our
general
escheat
statute
of
course,
that
does
not
follow
and,
in
other
states,
it
doesn't
follow
either.
in
the
case
of
stocks,
shares
of
stock
and
dividends
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
sure.
suppose
you
adopt
the
last
known
address
and
new
jersey
proceeds
under
its
14-year-statute
to
escheat
it.
we
perfect
our
right
by
title.
we
say
that
title
is
vested
in
the
state
as
to
this
claim.
now,
four
years
later,
the
creditor
comes
in
and
he
sues
sun
oil
company
in
illinois.
they
cannot
--
they
would
have
to
pay
the
claim
because
he
said
“well,
you
gave
my
property
away
on
my
last
known
address.
i
wasn't
even
there.”
that's
the
fallacy
in
the
last
known
address
rule.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
because
we
know
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
no,
we
know
where
the
state
of
incorporation
is.
if
you
say
the
state
of
incorporation,
then
we
have
an
absolute,
certain,
definite
standard.
that's
it.
it
can't
be
any
other
place.
but,
if
you
say
last
known
address,
it
may
be
someplace
else.
he
may
be
someplace
else.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
it's
to
the
exclusion
of
the
state
of
--
no
question
about
that,
but
not
to
the
creditor.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
i
think
so.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
well,
i
suppose
the
court
may
be
--
it
would
be
--
that
might
not
necessarily
follow.
i
don't
know
what
the
result
would
be
because
i
think
this
court
would
certainly
be
very
liberal,
if
we
plan
to
come
in
and
wanted
his
money
back
as
to
saying
that
he
was
barred,
but
it's
just
another
element
in
the
problem.
and,
as
to
stocks
and
dividends
of
a
corporation,
we
vigorously
urge
that
they
certainly
should
be
controlled
by
the
state
of
corporate
domicile
because,
there,
that
state
is
the
only
state
with
power
to
recognize
the
change
in
ownership
of
the
stock.
the
corporate
charter
includes
the
laws
of
the
state
within
the
charter,
and
we
feel
that,
as
to
stocks
and
dividends,
the
state
of
incorporation
should
be
the
controlling
standard
rather
than
the
last
known
address
which,
from
the
very
facts,
we
concede
does
not
now
exist.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
i
can
only
say,
in
respect
to
that,
mr.
justice
black,
that
if
this
court
was
to
decide
that
states
could
only
proceed
in
a
certain
manner,
i
think
all
the
states
would
fall
into
line.
if
they
were
to
say
that
you
proceed
better
or
you
obtain
more
by
a
custodial
statute,
i'm
sure
that
they
would
limit
themselves
to
custodial
statutes.
if
you
say
that
it
makes
no
difference,
custodial
or
escheat,
then
they
would
continue
the
way
we're
going
now.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
right.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
our
state
does
not
provide
that,
no.
after
a
period
of
14
years,
and
it's
escheated
and
it's
not
claimed,
four
to
five
unclaimed,
taken
by
the
state,
two
for
notice,
and
then
escheat.
seven
years
thereafter,
he
can
come
in
and
get
his
money
with
2%
interest.
if
he
doesn't
come
in
then,
the
money
is
escheated
and,
like
in
many
other
things
of
law,
there
must
be
an
end
someplace
and
that'd
be
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
right
--
well,
it's
a
little
more
than
that
because,
administratively,
we
can't
do
it
in
14
years,
maybe
14
or
16
years.
and,
the
only
other
comment,
i
would
like
to
make
would
be
that
we're
dealing
here
with
real
--
with
cash
claims
and
not
with
real
property.
mr.
ballard,
from
sun
oil,
said
the
point
is
reached
where
we
are
dealing
only
with
cash
claims
and
it's
not
to
be
confused
with
real
property
because
when
you
deal
with
real
property,
we're
satisfied.
there's
no
question,
but
it's
the
state
where
the
property
is
situated
that
can
escheat.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
well,
we
ran
it
down.
the
average
i
think
comes
about
$16.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
the
largest,
i
wouldn't
know
off
hand
but
it's
at
least,
i'd
say,
a
couple
of
hundred
dollars.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
well,
i've
heard
of
them
in
the
thousands
of
dollars.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
well,
the
--
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
a
single
claim,
i'd
say
$4,500
--
i
know
and
they
probably
might
even
be
higher.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
when
we
finally
came
to
this
court,
it
wasn't.
at
the
beginning,
it
was,
but
we
lost
on
wages
and
general
claims
on
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
right
and
we
got
to
this,
yes.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
right,
but
you
couldn't
really
--
it
might
be
any
amount.
we
looked
into
a
claim
with
standard
oil
company
that
involved
an
old
share
of
stock,
way
back
many,
many
years.
and,
if
we
approved
our
claim
on
that,
it
would've
run
into,
i
guess,
$100,000
by
the
splits
and
everything
else
that
occurred.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
our
state
held
that
if
the
claim
was
barred
at
the
time
we
enacted
the
escheat
law
by
the
statute
of
limitations,
then
there
was
no
longer
any
property
to
escheat.
mr.
charles
j.
kehoe
that's
correct.
that's
right.
