what
is
the
view
of
florida
as
to
people
who
didn't
have
any
last
known
address?
justice
potter
stewart
just
unknown.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
domicile
of
the
debtor?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
some
of
these
claims,
going
back
great
many
years,
it
may
not
--
there
may
not
--
nobody
may
know
where
the
claim
accrued.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
still
talking
though
not
about
cases
where
you
have
no
address
and
where
you
don't
know
where
the
claim
accrued
because
of
the
antiquity
of
the
claim.
justice
potter
stewart
domicile
of
the
debtor.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
owed
the
money.
justice
potter
stewart
the
court,
as
i
read
the
briefs,
some
of
these
claims
are
to
interest
that,
under
texas
law,
are
real
estate.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
ballard,
how
many
states
have
escheat
laws?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
was
wondering
about
the
case
of
--
where
a
person's
last
known
address
is
in
north
dakota,
and
let's
assume
north
dakota
doesn't
have
one
of
these
omnibus
escheat
law,
then
what
happens?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand.
i'm
just
making
one
thing
--
justice
potter
stewart
and,
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
had
a
rule
of
the
thing
that
the
domicile
of
the
corporation
is
the
only
state
which
could
escheat
and
the
corporation
where
--
incorporated
in
north
dakota,
it's
about
the
same
way.
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
get
to
that,
mr.
kehoe,
i'm
afraid,
i
didn't
follow
you.
if
we
adopted
the
last
known
address,
you
suggest
it
might
still
be
the
right
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
that
was
the
total
of
the
whole
bunch.
justice
potter
stewart
just
a
single
claim,
$4,500
is
about
the
largest.
