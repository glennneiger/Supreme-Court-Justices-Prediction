justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
thought
of
any
simple
rule
the
court
could
adopt
to
bring
about
payments
to
all
the
parties
in
these
things?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
expect
them
to
do
that,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
basis
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
to
do
that
in
each
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
to
do
that
in
each
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
bound
to
be
a
great
many
of
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
court
states
here
something
like
the
same
propositions,
is
it
not,
that
congress
would
be,
if
it
goes
on
to
enact
a
legislation
in
its
deal,
call
a
conflicting
claims
of
their
estate?
they'd
try
to
do
something
if
it'd
bring
about
some
kind
of
stability
and
some
kind
of
rule
that
can
be
understood
and
would
work
most
equitably
on
an
approximately
equitable
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
provided,
you
cannot
achieve
exact
equity.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there
should
be
something
better,
shouldn't
there,
than
saying
every
time
a
conflict
comes
up
between
two
or
three
or
four
states
courts
got
to
test
it
out
under
the
circumstances
of
each
case
and
decide
which
one
has
the
most
context
making
it
the
most
reasonable
and
fair,
for
it
to
get
it
far?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
should
be
a
better
way
than
that,
shouldn't
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that's
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
don't
think,
it
would
always
achieved
a
just
and
equitable
result,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that'd
be
satisfactory
to
one
of
the
states
if
it's
contesting
in
each
particular
lawsuit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
other
states
litigating
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
leave
too
much
to
be
decided
according
to
each
particular
case,
it
would
be
advisable,
would
it
not,
if
we
can,
to
find
some
kind
of
a
general
--
the
court
should
just
merely
recant
a
general
rule
that
would
fit
so
that
the
courts
didn't
have
to
engage
in
the
multitudinous
task
that
was
involved?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
after
your
study,
you
have
come
--
i'm
asking
you
because
i'm
interested.
after
your
study
and
reflection
on
it,
you
come
out
with
a
conclusion
that
the
nearest
to
a
fair
--
general
result
that
we
could
expect
to
be,
as
fair
as
we
can
achieve,
would
be
to
decided
in
each
case
according
to
the
context
each
state
had
--
litigating
state
had
at
the
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
something
like
you
call
arbitrary
has
to
be
behind
almost
all
laws
that
are
created
to
meet
difficult
situations,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
to
reach
a
kind
of
a
--
what
if
someone
says
“well,
it's
arbitrary
because
if
you
decided
over
here
and
look
at
these
men,
they
may
lose
because
i
know,
here,
these
definitely
may
lose.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there
are
some
--
certainly
some
reasonable
--
i
don't
know
if
it's
right
but
there
are
certainly
some
reasonable
grounds
that
can
be
offered
to
support
the
idea
that,
considering
--
what
was
the
last
known
address
as
a
man
who
would've
owned
the
money
if
he'd
been
litigated.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
right
but
there's
some
reasonable
--
that
supports
some
argument,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
may
be
where
he
--
that
was
where
he
was.
the
state
–
he
was
there
in
texas,
probably
another
state
at
the
time
he
was
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
owed
an
obligation
to
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
some
of
the
claims
in
field
are
rather
evanescent
there,
aren't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
the
corporation
might
not
accept
withholding
the
money?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
texas
wouldn't
pay.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
tell
me
in
11
years.
you
tell
me
in
short
and
that
extends
to
so
many
things
involved.
what
is
your
reason
for
believing
that
it's
fairer
for
the
state
corporate
domicile
to
have
this
on
than
any
other
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
is
that
the
same
argument
--
fairer
way
for
new
jersey
to
do
or
the
others?
it
could
be
left
to
the
company
to
keep
it
since
you're
going
to
keep
it
from
getting
charged
a
trial
and
so
forth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
--
not
preceded
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
no
legal
or
moral
right
to
it.
does
the
state
have
any
greater
moral
or
legal
right
--?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
it
than
the
corporation
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
fair
to
keep
there
as
against
other
states
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
than
the
corporations
there
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
for
who?
who
is
it
--?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
city
of
the
--
well,
the
corporation
didn't
own
it
and
never
did.
as
i
understand
it,
it
never
can.
it
has
no
moral
or
legal
claims
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
does
have
a
moral
or
legal
claim
to
it?
forget
the
sovereign.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
who
does
have
a
moral
or
legal
claim
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
but
if
it's
an
owner,
the
owner
would
have
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
if
you
are
going
to
trace
it,
you're
going
to
trace
it
as
a
moral
and
legal
right
of
somebody,
couldn't
you
necessarily
try
to
trace
it
to
the
--
where
the
owner
lives?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
can
you
suggest
any
better
plan
than
to
say
his
last
known
address
that
it'd
come
more
nearly,
in
all
instances,
taking
a
moral
position
to
come
more
nearly
for
that
letting
the
state
get
the
benefit
of
it
where
the
owner
lives.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
paying
him
back.
that's
where
he
lives.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
other
--
you
would
attribute
the
right
of
this
--
you
would
say
that
the
state
had
the
most
moral
and
equitable
right
to
it
by
the
--
by
its
owner
who
left
it
on
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright,
now,
you
don't
know
it
and
you
never
can
find
him
at
that
address
but
you
do
know
that?
i
looked
at
this
a
lot
of
these
people
never
did
live
in
new
jersey.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
didn't
and
they
were
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
never
lived
in
the
place.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and,
frequently,
with
reference
to
insurance
claims
for
instance,
they
may
be
policy
on
the
--
would
--
california
with
a
policy
in
new
jersey
or
connecticut
or
those
other
places.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
you
don't
have
it,
but
then
that's
a
part
of
our
big
problem.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
that
particular
point.
the
basic
idea
is
to
saying
who
can
escheat
that
property.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
left
owning
it.
and,
in
many
instances,
it
would
be
people
who
never
did
live
in
the
state
where
the
corporation
was
domiciled.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
just
–
there
are
so
many
arguments
to
be
maybe
played
out
but
i'm
staying
that's
the
best
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
we
have
no
legal
--
we
have
no
statute
covering
it,
do
we?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
whatever
we
say
is
not
based
on
a
federal
statute,
is
it?
just
the
situation
where
there's
a
conflict
among
the
states.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and,
it
falls
to
us
because
you
can't
have
him
going
anywhere
else
out
of
the
federal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
rights
of
--
that's
one
of
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
one
of
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
constitutional
rights
of
the
holder.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
that
could
be
done,
couldn't
it,
by
saying
“you
never
shall
own
it.
you
will
just
be
a
custodian”?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
they're
going
to
keep
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
get
down
basically
to
it,
it's
the
question
of
who
keeps
this
money
and
gets
the
benefit
of
that
money
by
the
owner's
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
we
may
along
the
same
line,
i
wonder
the
affinities
of
a
practical
stand
point
where
most
of
the
escheat
is
in
the
hands
of
just
a
few
states
like
delaware,
new
jersey,
new
york?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
maine
come
in
there
somewhere?
i
thought
maine
was
up
pretty
high.
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
pretty
high
then
if
it's
not
in
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
extent
of
your
claim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
people
known
who
lives
in
florida
you
find
in
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
books
of
the
company?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
florida
should
enact
a
law
and
you're
after
all
debts
pointing
to
people
shall
be
considered
as
real
estate,
should
we
act
on
the
assumption
in
deciding
a
rule
here
that
we
were
governed
by
that
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
problem
i
had
in
mind
was,
suppose
they
could
very
easily
settle
to
which
state
would
get
it
if
they,
suppose
these
are
all
debts,
they
simply
passed
a
law
that,
assuming
that's
right,
that
all
debts
are
to
be
treated
as
real
estate
in
the
state
and
that
if
we
were
to
hold
that
all
real
estates
could
be
of
this
kind,
we'd
be
governed
by
the
fact
that
the
thing
real
estate
then
there
wouldn't
be
much
problem
left.
the
states
would
adopt
the
law
saying
that's
a
real
estate,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and,
we'd
be
governed
by
the
state's
declaration
or
decision
or
label
of
debts
if
they
have
such,
i
don't
know
if
they
have,
that
debts
are
real
estate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
state
could,
for
its
purposes,
couldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
did
--
would
we
have
to
accept
it
in
determining
a
rule
as
to
a
heap
of
intangibles
including
debts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
tried
to
ask
you
a
question
but
i'm
getting
mixed
up
in
that
old
statement.
it
kind
of
disturbed
me,
i
am
try
to
decide
a
new
problem
by
names
and
labels
that
were
given
old
situations.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
difference
would
it
make?
they
said
debts
are
going
out
of
one
thing,
a
real
estate.
they
can
say
debts
is
going
out
everything
out
of
real
estate,
couldn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
we
can
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
with
reference
to
debts
who
can
escheat
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
then,
we
can
adopt
no
rules,
can
we?
justice
hugo
l.
black
our
problem
is
not
whether
that
old
definition
of
status
and
so
forth,
following
the
owner's
direct,
but
what
we're
going
to
do
in
this
situation
when
debts
are
owed
in
and
the
owner
doesn't
claim
on
it,
which
state
can
escheat
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
practical
problem.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
we
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
we
have
to
consider
what
its
status
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
do
we
have
to
consider,
in
this
case,
what
kind
of
rule
we
get
at
that
would
bring
about
some
kind
of
a
fair
and
equitable
solution
of
a
problem
calling
for
a
solution
here
at
our
doors
with
reference
to
who
can
escheat
debt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can't
we
do
it?
can
we
do
that?
are
we
compelled
to
decide
that
according
to
the
old
ancient
writings
on
whether
the
intangible
follows
the
owner?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
assume
--
i
have
assumed
that
it
had
to
be
viewed
all
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
it's
not
in
the
government
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
some
of
the
other
states
might
have
a
life
intended?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
you
have
an
amicus
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
another
clause
there
that
presents
that
if
she
remanded
by
some
brief,
that
is,
according
to
the
books
of
the
company.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
that
what
you're
arguing
upon?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
it
--
certainly,
the
company
just
didn't
put
it
down.
it
hasn't
put
one
down
for
40
years.
does
the
last
known
address,
according
to
the
books
of
the
company,
have
to
be
taken
even
with
those
which
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
flagrantly
--
flagrant
or
long?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
what
--
is
that
the
final
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
was
the
insurance
company
in
connecticut
and,
even
then,
does
the
--
somewhere,
it
was
hold
over
united
states
and
they
never
did
change
my
address,
never
did
have
a
last
known
address
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
merits
of
the
matter
wouldn't
have
been
on
the
last
known
address
the
company
knew
about,
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
there'd
be
merit
to
giving
it
to
the
state
where
he
last
lived,
the
fact
that
they
didn't
put
the
interest
in
that
shouldn't
--
couldn't
derive
they
don't
have
merit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
that's
the
only
test
we
could
use.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
was
pointing
out
is
that
that
holds
up
to
the
problem
itself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
it's
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
according
to
the
books
of
the
company.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
ballard,
i
was
--
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
any
formula
a
roué
with
that
would
give
advantage
to
the
debtor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
belief
that,
for
that
reason,
we
should
not
adopt
the
former
law
and
that
we
should
adopt
a
different
one
than
that
one
which
has
been
suggested
by
the
master?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
wanted
your
judgment.
you've
been
studying
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
didn't
object
to
stating
it,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
that
he's
right,
it's
the
fairest
method,
consider
the
last
known
address,
can
you
say
the
same
thing
for
saying
the
last
known
address
according
to
the
books
of
the
company
or
can
you
suggest
anything
else
that
would
be
better?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
we
assume
that
that
will
always
be
fair
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
seems
to
me,
if
i
may
be
--
i'm
going
to
ask
you
the
connection
with
this
question.
you're
arguing
against
the
escheat
and
for
a
custodial
statute,
unless
we
adopt
your
plan.
justice
hugo
l.
black
some
of
the
state
statutes,
as
i
recall,
i
may
be
wrong,
provide
that
in
any
time
the
