mr.
joseph
h.
resnick
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
wishes
to
state
its
position
as
being
in
accord
with
the
opinion
rendered
by
the
special
master
and,
consequently,
no
exemptions
were
filed.
originally,
pennsylvania
is
here
to
the
sufficient
contact
theory
based
on
the
fact
that
the
sun
oil
company
had
its
principal
office
and
place
of
business
in
pennsylvania.
but
after
further
consideration
of
the
issues
and
in
the
light
of
the
master's
report,
we've
changed
our
position
and
we
now
advocate
that
--
the
last
known
residence
theory
and
we
join
mr.
oman
in
his
arguments.
we
believe
that
the
last
known
residence
theory
is
the
most
practical
solution
of
the
three
theories
advanced
because,
first,
it
is
a
simple,
fair,
and
adequate
solution
to
a
complex
problem
that
involves
the
least
amount
of
litigation.
secondly,
it
considers
the
owner's
right
in
the
property
as
well
as
that
of
the
sovereign
and
by
advertising
in
the
jurisdiction
where
the
owner
was
last
seen
or
lived
or
was
known.
and,
this
is
our
position.
we
cannot
add
anymore
than
the
arguments
already
before
this
court.
mr.
joseph
h.
resnick
no,
sir,
i
did
not
file
a
brief.
