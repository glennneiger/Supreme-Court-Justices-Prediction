chief

i
don't
get
your

chief

chief

they

chief
justice
earl

mr.

there
was
no
live
broadcast
from
the
courtroom
during
this
trial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now
mr.
justice
clark
asked
you
the
question
when
was
it
broadcast
and
how?
chief
justice
earl
warren
nobody
is
talking
about
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
about
the
trial,
trial
itself.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
everything
but
the
sound?
chief
justice
earl
warren
everything
that
went
on
at
that
trial
with
the
exception
of
the
sound
was
monitored
and
sent
out
from

as

trial
proceeds.
is
that
correct?
chief

would
be
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
the
public
know
--
didn't
the
public
and
everybody
know
about
that
and
couldn't
they
see
it
in
the
courtroom?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.

there's
one
other
thing
that
i
still
don't
understand
from
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
goldwine,
goldberg,
excuse
me.[laughter]
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
matter
is
was
the
voice
of
the
prosecuting
attorney
taken
in
his
closing
argument,
broadcast
to
the
public?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
part
of
the
trial
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
said
a
little
while
ago
that
no
part
of
the
trial
(voice
overlap)
was
sound.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl

alright.
thank
you.
attorney
general
carr.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
the
argument
of
the
--
of
the
prosecution
broadcast
live?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
petitioner
and
his
counsel
[inaudible]
excluded
from
the
pictures
taken
during
the
argument
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
the
district
attorney?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
--
and
the
defendant
himself
was
not
photographed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
he
ever
photographed
in
the
courtroom?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
a
loud
speaker
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
a
court
has.
chief
justice
earl
warren
[inaudible]
location
in
one
of
the
briefs
from
new
york
times
describing
that
i
wonder
if
this
is
correct
at
all
correct.
it
says,
â€œa
television
motor
van,
big
as
an
intercontinental
bus,
was
parked
outside
the
courtroom
and
the
second-floor
courtroom
with
a
forest
of
equipment.
two
television
cameras
had
been
set
up
inside
the
bar
and
four
more
cameras
were
aligned
just
outside
the
gates.
the
microphone
stuck
its
progress
[inaudible]
inside
the
jury
box
and
now
occupied
by
an
overflow
of
reporters
from
the
press
table.
cables
and
wires
snaking
the
floor
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
right,
24th
and
25th
of
september.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
haven't
--
you
haven't
told
us
what
the
scene
was
in
that
courtroom.
you
told
us
what
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
i
wonder
if
you're
going
to
tell
us
what
the
scene
was
in
that
--
in
the
courtroom
on
those
days
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
it's
orderly
and
if
it's
orderly
and
so
forth.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
these
broadcasts
replaced
any
regular
programs?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
general,
you've
emphasized
that
during
the
hearing
of
the
witnesses
that
there
was
no
soundtrack,
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
your
case
be
any
different
from
your
standpoint
if
there
had
been
a
soundtrack?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
there
had
been
a
soundtrack?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
some
of
it
was
a
soundtrack.
the
argument
of
the
prosecution
was
soundtrack
and
you
used
that
and
now
suppose
you
have
gone
drawn
so
far
that
it
had
a
soundtrack
on
the
testimony.
would
that
infringe
your
case
at
all
or
do
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
contend
that
the
courts
have
a
right
to
do
it
whenever
they
want?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
know
how
many
times
he
had
filed
any
procedures
about
the
television
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
in
fact
is
in
every
felony
case
that
protects
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is.
are
all
your
courthouses
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
objection
from
counsel
to
filing
all
the
affidavits?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
jaworski.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
jaworski?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
are
some
differences
between
the
examples
you've
cite
and
the
[inaudible]
courtroom
press.
you
said
that
[inaudible]
might
do
that
because
they
were
in
the
courtroom,
but
here
we
have
a
situation
of
this
kind
and
set
out
by
the
court
itself
that
makes
those
things
not
only
possible,
but
probable.
now
doesn't
that
change
the
character
that
the
court
could
be
responsible
if
someway
[inaudible]
to
this
courtroom?
the
witness
did
thought
that
if
the
court
knowingly
set
up
the
situation
that
is
not
known
to
be
possible
but
was
likely
--
it
wouldn't
make
a
difference.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
other
things
are
--
are
inherent
in
the
trial,
in
the
courtroom
because
our
system
demands
if
the
public
to
the
extent
or
the
defendant
didn't
have
his
friends
in
the
general
public
to
see
the
trial,
to
see
that
he
is
not
being
deprived
of
any
of
his
rights
but
these
others
are
super
imposed
upon
it
and
are
not
going
to
protect
the
defendant,
but
for
the
commercialization
of
some
newspaper.
is
that
a
difference
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
right
in
the
constitutionality
of
it
that
it
wouldn't
be
a
absurd
rule
to
turn
this
on,
i
think
we
have
that
rule
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
said
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
isn't
a
constitutional
question
decided.
it
wouldn't
be
observe
that
that
is
a
rule
of
the
federal
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
[inaudible]
the
rules
of
the
judicial
process
of
the
united
states
describe
that
and
that
just
follows
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren

cofer.
