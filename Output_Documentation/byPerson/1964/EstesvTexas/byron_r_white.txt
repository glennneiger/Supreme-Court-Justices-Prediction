justice

but
was
the
sound
recorded
so
that
on
a
delayed
broadcast,
the
television
--
justice
byron
r.
white
for
a
delayed
broadcast
or
a
rebroadcast
for
a
news
event
at
night,
they
could
put
on
both
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
-â€“
both
the
pictures
and
the
sound.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
does
show
that
there
were
some
spot
news
broadcast
during
the
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
that
include
both
pictures
and
sound?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
i
understand
it
wasn't
simultaneously
broadcast
--
justice
byron
r.
white
say
that
night
after
a
day
of
trial
they
got
a
news
item
that
they
put
on
the
photograph
and
the
sound.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
understand
you
told
me
that
the
sound
was
also
monitored?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes,
the
sound
along
with
the
picture.
justice
byron
r.
white
those
contracts
--
those
contracts
made
by
the
television
people
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
instructions
to
the
jury
with
soundtrack?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
moment,
however,
there
was
a
television
picture
going
out
in
the
public,
namely
the
picture
of
the
judge.
while
he
was
arguing,
the
television
cameras
were
on
and
transmitting
a
picture
to
the
public,
a
live
broadcast
was
going
on
at
that
time
without
the
sound.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
the
record
showed
that
the
sound,
that
the
picture
went
out
and
then
with
it,
a
running
summary
by
someone
who
is
in
the
courtroom
listening.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
what
part
of
the
--
you
mean
all
the
videotapes
is
taken
over
the
entire
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
about
--
how
about
just
the
photographs
of
the
trial
proceeding
without
sound
which
they
did
take
and
which
part
of
which
were
rebroadcast
at
some
other
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
must
be
quite
a
month
old.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
only
reason
why
would
you
have
one
of
the
--
on
the
witness
table,
witness
stand,
witness
part.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
tell
the
time
[inaudible]
broadcast
live?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
deal
with
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
deal
with
the
[inaudible]
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
your
argument
then
would
be
exactly
the
same
as
the
television
here
has
not
been
limited
to
just
pictures
during
the
trial.
the
reason
the
court
gave
for
excluding
time
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
fair
trial
except
the
informing
other
witnesses
and
i
take
it
you
would
back
up
that
--
that
reason
and
if
that
is
term,
you
would
still
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
could
do
one,
you
could
do
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
48
states
with
the
same
rule,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
not
making
any
suggestion
here
that
the
48
states
or
the
federal
courts
which
excluded
absolutely
photographs
in
the
courtroom
is
in
anyway
contrary
to
the
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
the
federal
court
will
do
it
constitutionally
or
they'll
be
able
to
do
it
either
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
slightly
contradicted
to
what
the
state
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now
where
does
it
appear
or
does
it
in
the
record
that
they
were
wired
into
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
in
101
it
said
at
this
moment,
it
is
exceeding
the
trial
through
our
studio
where
it
is
being
taped?
