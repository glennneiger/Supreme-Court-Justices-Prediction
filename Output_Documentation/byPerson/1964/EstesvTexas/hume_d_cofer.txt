mr.
hume
d.
cofer
may
it
please
the
court.
the
defendant's
case
does
not
depend
upon
the
proposition
that
the
constitution
prevents
tv.
the
defendant's
case
depends
upon
proposition
that
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
object
to
a
process
which
has
no
judicial
function
and
which
will
probably
prejudice
it
and
to
that
where
that
process
has
no
judicial
function,
he,
the
defendant
ought
to
be
entitled
to
have
some
say
about
whether
or
not
it
is
utilized.
now
there
are
two
or
three
things
that
i
must
cover
about
the
facts
that
i
do
want
to
cover.
first,
there
was
a
question
about
when
the
defendant
arrived
in
september,
the
defendant
arrived
early
in
the
morning
in
the
courtroom
of
september
the
24th
only
15
or
20
or
30
minutes
after
the
proceedings
began
prior
to
the
arrival
of
the
defendant
--
the
defendant's
counsel
only
stated
their
position.
all
of
the
testimony
on
the
september
the
24th
and
25th
was
taken
in
the
presence
of
the
defendant.
this
is
not
the
way
the
courtroom
appeared
in
september.
the
way
the
courtroom
appeared
in
september
is
shown
by
the
photographs,
8/10
photographs,
the
shiny
ones,
which
show
the
cameras
in
the
microphones
and
that
one
microphone
that's
not
shown
and
it's
this
one
that
was
protruding
across
the
edge
of
the
jury
box
at
this
point,
the
directional
microphone
which
was
capable
of
picking
up
counsel
and
the
defendant's
conversations
at
this
table,
the
record
shows.
the
record
shows
that
there
was
sound
being
taped
in
october.
both
radio
reporters
testified
on
pages
99
and
pages
101
of
the
record
that
at
the
october
hearing,
they
were
tape
recording
that
portion
of
the
october
proceedings.
the
broadcast
of
that
sound
had
been
prohibited
and
the
reporters
testified
that
it
was
not
being
recorded
for
the
purpose
of
rebroadcast
but
it
was
available
for
rebroadcast
and
that
sound
was
being
recorded
in
october
by
the
radio
facilities
as
shown
on
pages
99
and
101
of
the
record.
sir?
mr.
hume
d.
cofer
yes
sir
on
pages
--
mr.
hume
d.
cofer
let
me
explain
that
it's
not
a
deliberate
contradiction
of
this
your
honor.
mr.
hume
d.
cofer
on
pages
99
and
101,
the
two
young
radio
reporters
were
called
to
the
witness
stand
in
october
and
testified
that
right
at
that
time
and
on
the
october
5th,
they
were
recording
the
sound.
they
said
that
they
were
not
doing
it
for
rebroadcast
but
they
were
recording
sound
and
they
had
the
facility
there
to
do
it
and
one
testified
on
page
101
that,
that
would
be
available
for
rebroadcast.
the
court
had
directed
in
order
that
it
may
not
be
rebroadcast
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
it
was.
mr.
hume
d.
cofer
the
radio
facilities
were
in
this
room,
out
this
door
right
here
your
honor
and
they
used
one
of
the
same
microphones
that
the
court
recorder
uses.
mr.
hume
d.
cofer
they
were
just
wired
into
the
court
recording
microphone
and
they
were
tape
recording
in
this
room
in
the
october
proceedings
which
â€“
one
of
which
was
being
transmitted
back
to
the
radio
station.
mr.
hume
d.
cofer
on
page
99
and
101.
a
tape
recorder
and
a
microphone
on
page
--
at
the
top
--
near
the
top
of
page
99,
top
of
page
101.
it
is
--
we
have
an
amplifier
sound,
amplifier
microphone
and
it's
being
taped
and
i
don't
see
the
part
about
the
microphone
your
honor
being
the
same
one
is
that
used
by
the
court
reporter
but
it
does
appear
another
place.
mr.
hume
d.
cofer
that
is
the
place
i
was
referring
to
i
[inaudible]
and
the
point
is
that
--
in
the
court's
question
that
it
was
sound
being
recorded
in
october
that
was
available
but
there's
no
record
--
there's
no
evidence
--
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
(voice

mr.
hume
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
mr.
hume
d.
cofer
not
being
broadcast
that
it's
available
and
there's
no
--
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
court's
order
in
that
regard
was
valid.
mr.
hume
d.
cofer
the
sound
tapes
are
not
your
honor.
the
only
tapes
that
are
available
are
the
video
tape
of
the
september
hearing,
both
names
in
three
roles,
none
of
the
october
video
tape
--
mr.
hume
d.
cofer
well
i'm
not
sure
that
the
--
the
tapes
themselves
were
material
your
honor,
there's
no
evidence
that
they
were
just--
mr.
hume
d.
cofer
your
honor,
i
was
--
it's
not
an
important
matter.
there
was
a
question
from
the
court
about
whether
there
was
any
sound
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
an
obligation
to
explain
that
there
was
this
one
recording
incident.
i
believe
that
it
is
not
important
to
the
case.
there
were
instead
of
the
three
cameras
shown
in
the
model,
there
are
four
cameras
shown
in
the
model.
the
testimony
shows
that
there
were
five
cameras
shown
in
the
model
on
page
65.
that
was
on
the
opening
days
of
the
october
hearing.
the
model
does
not
show
and
they
have
not
been
mentioned,
the
press
photographers
who
were
not
required
to
stay
in
the
booth,
they
were
permitted
the
full
access
to
the
room
and
so
long
as
they
stayed
behind
the
jury
box.
and
the
press
photographers,
these
pictures
that's
shown
here,
the
two
boys,
the
upi
and
the
ap
with
cameras
ready
to
open
were
given
to
enter
the
room
and
were
permitted
to
stand
here
and
here
or
anywhere
along
the
room
to
take
pictures
of
the
proceeding.

yes

mr.

excuse
me.
i
have
one
exception
to
that.
during
the
arguments,
the
photographers
were
required
to
go
to
the
booth.
the
press
photographers
were
required
during
the

to

that's
the
exception

mr.

it
is.

--
i
believe
that
photography
(voice

mr.
hume
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
mr.
hume
d.
cofer
i
believe
that
photography
is
fairly
within
the
limit
your
honor.
it
calls
that
canon
35
expressly
refers
to
photographs.
mr.
hume
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
i
know
there's
(voice

mr.
hume
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
mr.
hume
d.
cofer
we
say
that
there's
a
probable
prejudice
with
respect
to
jurors,
with
respect
to
witnesses,
with
respect
to
counsel,
with
respect
in
this
case
to
other
litigation
of
the
defendant
and
that
probable
prejudice
justifies
the
defendant's
position
that
he's
entitled
to
object
based
upon
the
standards
of
the
unimagined
that
are
accepted
standards
in
48
states
and
the
federal
courts
[inaudible]
mr.
hume
d.
cofer
yes
sir
all
judges
are
elected.
i
believe
that
might
be
one
exception
to
that
retired
judge
has
served
for
a
few
years
without
election.
i
see
your
honor
that
my
lights
are
on.
i
ask
alternatively
to
the
court
to
correct
now
one
or
two
other
statements
of
fact
to
follow
memorandum
concerning
it
and
the
memorandum
would
serve
the
purpose
if
the
court
wishes
to
proceed.
i
would
ask
leave
to
file
these
statements
referred
to
by
my
counsel's
opening
argument.
this
is
particularly
with
the
position
in
reference
to
public
trial
and
i
report
in
my
argument
and
i
--
they
wrote
it
but
i
didn't
