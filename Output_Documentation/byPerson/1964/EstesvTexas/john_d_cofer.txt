mr.
john
d.
cofer
may
it
please
your
honor
and
members
of
the
court.
the
estes
case
is
a
case
which
has
given
rise
to
consideration
for
this
court
a
very
important
question.
the
few
times
i've
been
before
this
court,
i
always
feel
humbled.
if
plutarch
said,
great
men
must
be
born
in
famous
cities
and
maybe
enough
lawyers
must
have
famous
clients
and
so
my
claim
gentlemen
is
possibly
my
famous
client.
mr.
estes
was
indicted
in
the
state
court
on
a
three-count
indictment
and
he
was
convicted
of
swindling.
the
effect
of
the
charge
was
that
he
had
induced
a
farmer
to
sign
a
note
and
he
was
paid,
the
farmer
was
10%
of
what
proceeded
from
the
note
would
realize
for
signing
that
and
that
mr.
estes
by
misrepresentations
that
secured
possession
of
that
instrument
which
was
property
on
the
facts
it
was
not
a
particularly
strong
case
as
presented
in
courts.
the
important
thing
and
the
thing
that
this
court
is
interested
in
and
has
limited
its
review
is
this
matter
of
photography
and
tv
in
the
courtroom
and
the
standards
as
expressed
by
canon
35
and
the
standards
which
have
been
recognized
in
the
federal
courts
in
rule
53.
the
briefs
of
the
state
present
the
natural
question.
well
they
took
his
picture
in
the
courtroom,
so
what?
why
make
a
federal
case
out
of
it
and
when
i
say
that
i
use
it
in
a
slang
meaning
that
the
dictionary
of
slang
says
hold
the
emphasis
that
judiciary
code
says
invasion
of
a
federal
right
makes
a
federal
case.
when
counsel
read
in
the
paper
that
it
was
contemplated
that
this
case
would
be
televised,
counsel
didn't
feel
that
they
could
bring
their
client
into
the
courtroom
to
answer
the
charges
against
him.
they
asked
permission
of
the
court
to
appear
without
their
counsel
to
protest
the
tv.
certainly,
it
would
--
mr.
john
d.
cofer
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
this
was
when
the
case
was
called
for
trial.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes,
yes
sir.
the
case
was
called
to
trial
and
the
case
was
continued.
what
i
had
reference
to
your
honor
was
that
when
he
--
his
case
has
said
the
defendant
is
under
bond,
he
has
to
appear
in
court.
this
defendant
was
unwilling
to
appear
in
court
because
of
the
television
vans
in
front
of
the
courthouse
because
he
was
to
be
publicized
to
the
world
as
a
man
who
stole
$20
million.
defendant's
due
process
should
include
it
seems
to
me
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
appear
in
court
and
answer
to
the
charges
and
that
those
things
that
interfere
with
and
in
the
opinion
of
his
counsel
would
injure
him
in
his
appearance,
raise
serious
questions
of
invasion
of
the
defendant's
rights.
we
must
remember
that
a
defendant
is
presumed
to
be
innocent
and
he
may
not
your
honors
be
treated
as
if
he
were
guilty.
he
doesn't
become
a
public
character
whose
picture
can
be
broadcast
to
the
world.
he
stands
just
as
the
ordinary
citizen,
the
right
to
sit
in
his
home
and
not
have
photographers
come
and
take
his
picture.
the
right
to
go
to
business
and
not
to
have
them
come
in
his
office,
the
right
as
an
innocent
man
to
appear
in
court
and
not
have
his
suit
that
he
wears,
his
shoes
that
he
wears
publicized
to
the
entire
world
and
those
things
which
bear
no
reasonable
relation
to
the
determination
of
his
innocence
or
his
guilt
are
not
a
legitimate
part
of
the
judicial
process.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
your
honor,
i
was
going
to
get
that,
yes
sir.
at
the
first
trial,
of
course
it
was
room
travesty,
there
were
some
10
or
12
cameras
that
were
mounted
on
high
tables
and
pictures
show
in
the
record
of
just
exactly
what
the
courtroom
scene
was.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that
was
a
hearing
on
the
motion
for
continuance
and
the
hearings
of
certain
motions
to
quash
and
certain
legal
problems.
that
lasted
for
two
days.
every
bit
of
that
was
televised.
it
was
rebroadcast
on
the
tape
which
is
part
of
the
record
on
a
two-hour
broadcast
and
sponsored
by
soft
drinks,
soap
and
things
of
that
kind.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
john
d.
cofer
no
the
jury
had
been
--
certain
jurors
had
been
called
but
those
jurors
were
excused
and
the
panel
was
not
selected
out
of
those
jurors.
the
jurors
who
actually
served
as
i
remembered
--
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
no,
not
the
jury
was
paneled.
there
was
a
jury
paneled
there,
if
we
had
gone
to
trial
it
would
have
been
impaneled
but
we
didn't'
go
to
trial.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that's
right.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that's
right.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
but
they
were
excused.
other
panel
--
another
panel
was
drawn
a
month
later.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
john
d.
cofer
well
it's
a
practice
in
texas
that
for
each
--
when
a
case
is
called
a
panel
is
called,
and
then
if
the
cases
don't
go
to
trial
that
week,
that
panel
is
excused
and
a
new
panel
is
called
for
succeeding
weeks.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
no,
it
had
nothing
to
do.
they
weren't
excused
for
prejudice
or
anything
of
that
kind.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that
is
true,
a
number
of
them
have
seen
the
proceedings
on
television
your
honor,
the
two-hour
broadcast
and
some
of
them
had
actually
seen
it
live
and
televised.
those
that
had
--
sir,
of
course
from
the
standpoint
(voice
overlap)
of
prejudice
in
this
case
which
i'm
not
sure
is
part
of
what
the
court
had
granted.
nine
jurors
in
this
case
said
they
had
an
opinion
as
to
the
guilt
of
the
defendant,
but
they
said
they
could
put
it
aside,
nine
who
actually
served
but
they
said
they
could
put
it
aside
and
call
[inaudible]
mr.
john
d.
cofer
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that's
right.
well
(voice
overlap)
based
on
tv,
it's
based
on
newspaper
publicity.
it
was
based
on
all
those
things.
on
the
billie
sol
estes
jokes,
on
the
ballads
of
billie
sol,
different
things
of
the
record
reflects
that
these
people
had
heard
and
had
formed
opinions
of
it.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that's
right.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
hearing.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that's
right.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that's
right.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that's
correct.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that's
right.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that's
right.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
well
prior
to
then
--
to
the
october
trial
when
the
case
was
--
actually
the
trial
the
court
issued
release
to
press
in
which
he
defined
the
rules
and
the
television
was
confined
to
a
booth
in
the
rear
of
the
courtroom.
it
was
a
special
built
booth.
the
color
of
the
plywood
walls
was
approximately
the
color
of
the
courtroom.
there
was
a
space
about
that,
a
foot-and-a-half
wide,
that
some
three
to
six
cameras
protruded.
there
were
directional
mics,
there
--
people
with
silent
cameras
were
permitted
to
stay
in
the
courtroom
and
if
they
took
no
flashlights
were
permitted
to
take
the
pictures
during
the
trial.
they
actually
didn't
broadcast
the
testimony
of
the
interrogation
of
the
jurors
and
picking
the
venire
or
the
witnesses,
because
it
was
--
an
effort
was
honestly
made
that
witnesses
outside
the
courtroom
wouldn't
know
what
the
witnesses
in
the
courtroom
and
as
all
witnesses
were
under
rule
had
testified
to,
then
each
night
wide,
well
during
the
day
and
during
the
trial
were
these
scenes
broadcast
and
--
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
i
believe
the
record
shows
it
was
but
it
wasn't
being
broadcast
out.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
it
was
monitored
and
then
broadcast
out.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
but
not
direct
from
the
courtroom.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
well,
by
the
radio
company,
radio
--
mr.
john
d.
cofer
no,
there
was
--
oh
no,
not
by
counsel,
no.
not
by
anybody
who
had
taken
an
oath
your
honor
and
i
might
as
well
say
that
the
press,
this
idea
that
their
right
to
be
present
even
in
this
court
and
to
take
pictures.
suppose
the
press
was
required
to
hold
up
their
right
hand
and
say,
“we
swear
that
we
will
truthfully
report
the
truth
and
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
of
this
trial,”
we
would
have
hell
to
high
heaven
on
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution
and
it's
the
lack
of
juridical
legitimacy
that
makes
the
press
irresponsible
from
the
legal
standpoint,
that
makes
the
tv
irresponsible.
they
have
no
judicial
function
to
perform
because
all
of
us
are
under
oaths,
the
reporter
is
under
oath.
everything
a
person
has
something
to
do
puts
an
oath,
but
the
first
amendment
says,
these
people
can
report
what
occurs.
the
defendant
is
not
entitled
even
to
a
fair
reporting,
not
even
an
honest
reporting
of
his
case.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
oh,
it
applies
to
all
of
them.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that's
right.
it
didn't
--
they
have
a
model,
here
it
is,
right
at
the
back
of
it.
this
typifies
your
honor,
i
saw
it
for
the
first
time
yesterday,
it
typifies
tv
because
it
idealizes
the
courtroom
scene
and
tv
attempts
to
do
that.
for
example,
i
notice
the
counsel
at
the
table
representing
the
defendant.
as
it
happened,
all
three
of
the
counsels
were
decidedly
bald.
this
gives
them
all
three
a
very
beautiful
head
of
hair
and
i
suppose
that's
tv's
on
the
stateside
here
that
well
you
should
have
a
fine
head
of
hair,
at
least
they
make
a
better
image
on
television.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
no
sir.
in
this
model
your
honor,
that
is
before
the
court
here.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
well
i
just
[attempt
to
laughter]
my
only
point
was
that
your
honor
and
perhaps
it
was
not
particularly
well
taken,
was
that
television
has
a
tendency
to
idealize
the
courtroom.
for
example
it
has
been
suggested
that
it'd
be
a
great
thing
that
this
court
could
have
its
proceedings
televised,
but
your
honors
couldn't
wear
black
robes
because
it's
notorious.
that
black
creates
a
very
poor
image
in
television.
you
would
have
to
wear
blue
robes.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
your
honor
i'm
just
slightly
--
mr.
john
d.
cofer
your
honor
i
--
mr.
john
d.
cofer
no
sir.
my
point
is
that
in
a
trial
court,
any
procedure
which
doesn't
by
some
reasonable
relation
to
termination
of
a
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
accused
is
a
matter
which
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
object
to.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that's
right.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that's
my
point
exactly.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
i
don't
think
that
if
he
didn't
object
that
is
necessary,
it
could
become
fundamental
error
as
in
rideau
versus
louisiana.
why
it
was
so
--
such
a
terrible
travesty
on
justice
and
your
--
this
court
granted
it,
but
i
don't
say
this
is
a
rideau
case.
i
say
that
the
defendant
makes
the
objection.
now
who
has
a
right
to
make
that
decision?
it
is
suggested
by
the
state
that
we
do
it
by
experiment,
that
we
go
through
a
system
of
experiments
and
determine
whether
or
not
television
actually
causes
prejudice.
gentlemen,
your
honors,
in
deciding
what
should
be
done
in
his
client's
case,
the
attorney
for
the
defendant's
opinion
is
supreme.
it
transcribes
even
the
rights
of
the
court
itself
because
he
has
a
responsibility
of
determining
whether
this
is
going
to
damage
his
client's
case
and
my
clients
your
honor
are
not
going
to
be
if
i
can
help
it,
the
victims
of
an
empirical
decision
on
the
use
of
television.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
oh
no
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
no
sir.
your
honor
--
mr.
john
d.
cofer
your
honor,
i
have
some
very
definite
ideas
on
that.
i
don't
think
the
right
of
free
speech
and
i
will
also
address
my
margin
to
the
senior
justice,
where
the
right
of
press
is
hard
and
right
to
a
fair
trial.
i
believe
that
the
purpose
of
free
speech
and
free
press
is
to
ensure
a
fair
trial
and
it's
as
just
as
professor
charles
black
said,
it's
a
question
of
the
school
of
the
particular
right.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
he
can't
prevent
under
the
first
amendment
the
right
of
the
people
to
know
so
that
they
can
talk
about
the
trial.
the
right
to
know
is
part
of
the
right
of
free
speech
and
the
lawyer
has
no
right
to
rule
out
the
public
and
though
the
constitution
guarantees
it
and
that
i
don't
contend
that
the
right
to
a
public
trial
was
not
part
of
the
general
public's
right
to
come
in
and
watch
the
trial.
the
defendants
criticize
--
mr.
john
d.
cofer
i
don't
think
so
your
honor
because
i
don't
think
that
his
objection
would
be
based
upon
reasonable
grounds
and
as
we
brief
this
question,
the
right
to
object,
we
say
that
defendant's
right
to
object
in
this
case
is
based
upon
certain
reasonable
grounds
which
we
outline
some
seven
of
them
and
i
think
they
must
be
reasonable
grounds.
your
honor,
it
has
been
held
that
the
defendant
can
demand
a
closed
trial,
but
i
am
rather
--
feel
and
i
felt
even
before
singer
versus
united
states
has
reason
to
say
that
that's
not
a
right
of
the
defendant
to
demand
that
he
had
a
closed
trial.
i
don't
think
of
that,
so
i
don't
argue
with
that,
but
i
do
say
that
these
techniques
of
reporting
which
in
the
opinion
of
the
lawyer
interferes
with
fair
trial
and
what
are
these
things?
in
the
first
place,
it
lowers
the
dignity
of
the
courtroom,
the
use
of
the
television.
but
after
all,
dignity
doesn't
--
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
says
the
court
has
to
be
dignified,
at
least
i
don't
remember
it
in
one
of
the
first
ten
amendments
or
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
there
is
nothing
in
that,
that
says
you
can't
take
pictures
and
not
even
ten
times,
i
guess
they
knew
about
ten
times
from
the
constitution,
but
what
is
it
that
makes
this
part
of
due
process?
the
defendants
say
that
they
disagree
with
the
statement
that
has
been
made
by
in
an
article
by
a
member
of
this
court,
that
the
limitation
of
a
public
trial,
so
as
to
prevent
the
highest
and
largest
number
of
people
to
hear
it
and
see
it
that
if
that
position
is
taken,
they
disagree
with
the
justice.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir
(voice

mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir,
the
record
shows
that.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that's
right.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that's
right
and
it
was
sent
out
part
of
the
time
during
the
trial.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
if
you
mean
by
live
voices
going
out
over
at
the
time
from
the
witnesses
themselves,
it
was
not.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
no
sir.
the
problem
here
was
that
the
lawyers
had
the
feeling
that
this
taking
the
pictures
back
there
behind
them
was
detracting
them
from
the
trial.
now
the
state
has
filed
affidavits
of
every
member
of
the
juror
in
this
case
and
we've
made
no
objection
that
it
didn't
interfere
with
them
in
trying
this
case
and
i
read
those
affidavits
of
interest.
the
--
well
the
significant
thing
about
one
of
the
affidavits
was
that
they
said
that
the
thing
that
really
interfered
with
the
trial
was
mr.
cofer,
the
attorney
for
the
defendant
continually
objecting
to
what
was
going
on
and
making
them
go
out
so
that
they
couldn't
see
and
hear
but
[inaudible]
the
trial.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
d.
cofer
what
was
going
on
at
the
trial
because
i
would
have
the
jury
moved
while
i
was
making
the
objection
so
this
juror
sent
this
affidavit.
now
it
seems
from
that,
that
the
television
or
something
was
so
affecting
counsel
in
the
defense
of
his
client,
that
he
is
making
a
very
poor
impression
from
the
jury.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
no
words
broadcast.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
well
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
it
was
fully
brought
--
mr.
john
d.
cofer
about
the
trial.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
alright,
then
it
was
--
the
arguments
were
broadcast
to
the
jury,
except
at
the
request
of
the
defendant,
the
defendant's
pictures
were
--
the
lawyer's
pictures
were
taken,
but
what
they
were
saying
was
not
broadcast.
we
objected
to
our
argument
being
broadcast.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
was
that
all
that
was
--
mr.
john
d.
cofer
no
the
jury
verdict
as
in
the
rideau
case
was
broadcast.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
the
testimony
of
the
witness
themselves
were
not
broadcast.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
the
argument
and
the
verdict
and
the
selection
of
the
jurors
in
the
beginning,
but
not
what
the
juror
said.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
the
argument
was
broadcast
except
the
defendant's
arguments
were
not.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
was
broadcast,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
no,
though
it
placed
the
defendant
somewhat
at
disadvantage
your
honor,
that
only
their
backs
and
that
the
only
way
they
could
get
in
on
the
show
was
to
turn
around
and
look
at
the
camera
and
which
i
endeavored
very
carefully
not
to
do.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
i
think
the
record
shows
that
it
was
taken
by
radio,
but
not
transmitted.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
may
i
confer
with
my
counsel
on
that
for
a
moment?
it
was
recorded
unavailable
for
rebroadcast
--
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that's
right.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
and
what
was
said.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
the
record
doesn't
disclose
it
sir.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that's
right.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
not
during
the
actual
progress
of
the
trial.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir
but
later
did,
yes,
later
did.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
the
record
doesn't
show
that
your
honor
and
i
wouldn't
say
--
personally,
i
didn't
watch
them.
i
got
enough
in
the
courtrooms
so
--
i
didn't
even
speak
from
outside
the
record
on
that.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
my
claim
is
not
alternative.
it's
mainly
that
what
went
on
in
the
courtroom
interfered
with
the
lawyers
getting
an
adequate
defense
to
their
client.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
no
sir.
i
say
that
the
fact
that
it
goes
out
calculates
to
prejudice
the
defendant's
case
outside
the
courtroom.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
actually,
nothing
of
what
was
said
the
pictures
were
broadcast,
but
nothing
what
was
said.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
that
is
the
--
not
the
very
words
but
the
picture
was
broadcast.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that's
right.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
it
was
monitored
so
it
could
be
sent
out
later.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir
and
just
one
radio
station
was
permitted
to
take
it
but
he
had
to
make
it
available
to
all
of
them.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir
and
it
has
certain
qualifications
for
the
judge.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that's
right.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that's
right.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
now
if
i
could
say
right,
one
that
deter
of
something
that
was
asked
over
here
of
my
position.
it's
not
my
position
that
we
have
to
sustain
actual
prejudice
in
this
case
your
honor.
i
say
that
the
possibility
of
prejudice
is
the
thing
that
denies
the
defendant
the
fair
trial.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
your
honor,
i
will
have
to
ask
you
to
ask
that
question
again.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
i
don't
think
the
record
reflects
that
your
honor
except
that
they
could
see
the
--
mr.
john
d.
cofer
no.
it
was
taken
from
this
booth
in
the
booth
without
special
lighting.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
but
not
to
the
witnesses
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
oh
yes,
they
could
see
it
and
read
it
in
paper.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
yes
sir
it
was.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
and
the
only
way
--
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
i
did
it
inadvertently
then
your
honor
if
i
said
that
because
they
did
take
the
argument.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
and
we
had
thought
that
the
ruling
was
that
they
were
not
even
going
to
take
our
picture
and
i
wouldn't
have
known
they
took
the
picture
if
i
hadn't
seen
it
in
the
national
magazine,
the
back
of
my
head,
but
evidently
they
were
taking
the
picture
because
i
recognized.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
no.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
no
they
were
not
permitted
to
go
home
at
night.
now
--
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that's
right.
now
there
again
your
honor,
i
want
to
bring
your
honors
back
to
our
position
that
it
is
not
actual
prejudice
but
if
you're
going
to
adopt
a
rule
of
procedure
permitting
television
then
you're
going
to
have
to
say
all
juries
must
be
impounded
or
they'll
watch
television.
so
are
we
going
to
adopt
the
rule
in
texas
and
colorado,
the
rule
in
texas
and
colorado
and
apply
it
to
federal
courts
and
to
all
the
other
48
states
of
the
union
and
say,
you've
got
to
lock
your
juries
up
because
they
might
watch
television.
so
it's
not
exactly
lock.
your
honor,
one
of
the
things
that
affects
the
fairness
of
the
trial
is
the
attitude
with
which
the
lawyer
approaches
it.
i
know
as
early
as
1951,
judge
arnold
wrote
an
article
in
atlantic
monthly
in
which
he
watched
the
costello
hearing
and
he
said
that
public
trial
doesn't
mean
that
the
trail
can
be
used
as
an
instrument
for
publicity.
that
idea
has
been
the
idea
of
making
a
theater
out
of
the
courtroom,
there
were
also
things
that
deny
a
fair
trial
that
you
can't
demonstrate
to
actual
prejudice.
for
example,
i
spoke
of
robes,
courts,
as
a
matter
of
judicial
rules,
wear
robes
but
suppose
the
judge
doesn't
wear
the
robe,
can
i
say
well
he
has
denied
a
due
process.
the
judge
didn't
wear
a
robe.
the
court
was
open
with
a
prayer.
suppose
they
don't
open
the
courtroom
with
a
prayer.
have
i
been
denied
due
process?
i
don't
think
so,
but
those
things
which
affect
the
defendant's
idea
and
his
counsel
idea
that
this
man's
basic
rights
of
innocence
are
being
violated
in
that
he
is
being
published
throughout
the
world
as
a
guilty
man
and
--
mr.
john
d.
cofer
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
d.
cofer
well
because
taken
with
the
publicity
on
this,
here
is
the
man
whose
picture
is
being
taken
to
who
is
accused
of
stealing
this
large
amount
of
money.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir,
but
you
can't
take
the
man's
picture
even
in
the
penitentiary
itself
your
honor.
when
the
man
has
been
convicted,
you
can't
go
in
and
take
his
picture
without
his
consent
and
publicize
him
to
the
world
as
villain
--
mr.
john
d.
cofer
and
he
can't
be
treated
as
a
villain.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
your
honor,
i
say
the
basic
right
of
human
being
to
privacy
denies
the
right
to
have
himself
advertised
for
any
purpose
to
the
public.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
follows,
because
conventional
reporting,
the
newspapers
come
in,
they
take
down
what
is
said,
they
report
it
later,
that
doesn't
have
the
same
psychological
barrier
which
you
have
in
the
use
of
tv
which
dramatizes
the
situation
and
which
makes
it
impossible
for
the
defendant
and
his
counsel
unless
they
are
willing
to
descend
to
violation
of
canons
on
which
they
believe.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
that's
it
exactly
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
and
--
mr.
john
d.
cofer
and
you
take
a
lawyer
who
has
to
take
the
responsibility
of
--
well
not
televising
my
client,
will
it
or
will
it
not
hurt
my
client.
well
all
said
if
he
says
to
himself,
i'll
get
my
picture
in
the
television
and
we'll
try
and
see
if
it
hurts
my
client.
that's
not
the
decision
that
a
lawyer
makes.
a
lawyer
--
it's
the
appearance
to
ethics
of
his
profession
your
honor
that
enables
a
lawyer
to
form
a
foundation
upon
which
he
can
evaluate
his
service
to
his
client
and
if
he
violates
those
ethics,
that's
accepted
by
the
bar
association
to
which
he
belongs,
then
he
makes
it
impossible
for
himself
to
judge
himself
as
competent
counsel
for
his
client.
so
he
doesn't
make
an
empirical
decision.
he
makes
an
intuitive
one.
this
is
wrong.
my
fellow
lawyers
think
it's
wrong
and
i
am
not
going
to
permit
it,
not
on
my
client,
let
them
experiment
with
somebody
else's
client
if
he's
willing
to
be
experimented
with.
now
that
is
a
serious
question.
now,
i
think
that
this
isn't
an
interference
with
federalism.
justice
stewart
said
that
sound
federalism,
i
may
not
repeat
it
exactly,
seeks
to
get
uniformity
and
not
conflict
between
the
state
and
the
federal
systems.
judge
frankfurter
said
that
this
court
doesn't
sit
here
to
impose
the
federal
rules
on
state
courts
and
i
recognize
that.
but
here,
we
have
a
rule
not
canon
35
but
a
standard
of
conduct
in
the
courtroom
which
is
accepted
by
48
states
and
even
in
texas
and
colorado,
is
accepted
in
all
but
the
trial
courts.
i
say
that
true
federalism
is
better
served
by
a
uniform
rule
such
as
the
court
adopted
in
gideon
versus
wainwright
rather
than
leaving
to
every
case
in
texas
and
colorado,
a
determination
by
the
federal
court
either
this
court
or
another
federal
court
whether
or
not
there
was
really
prejudice
in
that
case.
when
you
can
prohibit
the
prejudice
by
providing
a
rule
that
will
require
texas
and
colorado
to
comply
with
the
other
48
states.
then
there
is
no
other
effective
way
of
controlling
television
or
preventing
what
has
occurred
so
many
times
when
courts
have
tried
to
control
it
by
rule.
of
course
this
court
has
held
you
can't
do
it
by
contempt.
canon
28
of
texas
says
that
the
judges
had
gone
together
and
agreed
that
they
will
fix
certain
rules
for
televising
and
that
if
anybody
violates
that
rule
or
criticizes
it
in
an
editorial,
then
the
judge
shall
fine
that
person
for
contempt.
i
don't
think
that
violates
antitrust
law,
but
it
at
least
is
going
[attempt
to
laughter]
to
be
difficult
to
get
this
court
to
sustain
a
contempt
for
a
newspaperman
that
says,
“well,
i
don't
like
this
rule
that
this
judge
has
provided
in
his
court
about
the
television.”
you
can't
do
it
by
inter-media
and
bar
association
cooperation,
because
the
media
just
doesn't
think
that
they
should
be
restrained
from
saying
what
they
please.
and
they
have
the
right
under
the
first
amendment
to
say
what
they
think
and
please.
so,
the
only
practical
way
of
insuring
a
fair
trial
is
a
uniformity
of
rule
which
would
prohibit
television.
now
on
the
question
of
whether
it
interferes
with
freedom
of
the
press
and
freedom
of
speech,
the
valente
case,
and
even
cases
held
that
the
freedom
of
speech
doesn't
include
the
right
to
discover
things
and
i
don't
entirely
agree
with
that.
i
think
that
if
you
just
have
the
right
to
talk
but
don't
have
the
right
to
find
out
some
it
would
be
disgusting
and
[inaudible].
and
in
the
same
way,
the
sixth
amendment
doesn't
say
that
anybody
but
the
defendants
should
be
entitled
a
public
trial,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
public
can't
come
and
watch
the
trial,
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
you've
got
to
make
it
possible
for
the
whole
world
to
hear
about
it.
and
the
distinguished
attorney
general
of
texas
is
eminent
trial
counsel,
assistant
district
attorney
general.
i
do
not
believe
or
take
the
position
that
public
trial
means
make
it
possible
for
just
as
many
people
as
possible
to
hear
it.
they
indicate
that
in
their
brief,
but
they're
speaking
as
advocates
and
in
the
archives
in
the
history
of
our
state
both
[inaudible]
on
the
records
of
contrary
and
they
were
speaking
then
for
the
archives
and
not
as
advocates.
i
don't
like
to
talk
about
balancing
because
i
have
read
so
many
cases
and
i'm
not
entirely
in
the
court
with
the
rules
of
balancing.
i
read
nickel
john,
i
read
chaffy.
i
have
read
sutherland's
opinions
and
i
read
justice
black's
opinions
and
i
believe
that
freedom
of
the
press
includes
a
right
to
discover
and
find
out
what
to
talk
about,
but
i
don't
believe
as
this
court
held
in
cox
versus
louisiana
that
this
right
of
petition
and
this
right
to
speak
includes
the
right
to
interfere
with
the
processes
of
the
courts.
and
i
think
that
in
determining
that
if
it's
not
a
matter
of
just
procedure,
but
it's
a
matter
which
may
affect
the
fairness
of
the
trial,
that
the
attorney
gets
into
possession
that
i
have
seen
recently
reported
to
by
opinion
of
our
circuit
and
i
don't
pass
on
correctness
of
this
position.
it
was
decided
by
en
banc
in
the
fifth
circuit
that
the
attorney
for
the
government
could
not
be
required
against
his
conscience
to
sign
indictment
or
prepare
an
indictment
had
been
returned
by
grand
jury.
then
can
a
lawyer
who
is
defending
an
accused
be
required
to
submit
his
client
to
having
his
picture
taken
and
the
danger
that
may
occur
as
a
result
of
the
character
of
trial.
i
don't
believe
that
freedom
of
the
press
means
that
it
is
to
be
made
possible
that
the
guilt
and
innocence
of
the
accused
is
to
be
determined
in
the
marketplace.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
d.
cofer
by
the
fact
that
the
people
could
see
parts
of
this
televised
and
reported
by
monitoring
and
didn't
see
at
all
and
we're
forming
opinions
about
the
guilt
of
this
and
regardless
of
that
even
if
he'd
been
acquitted.
the
court
would
say
well
there's
bunch
of
rascals,
it
recently
occurred
in
a
recent
–
[inaudible]
let
me
illustrate.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
mr.
john
d.
cofer
yes
sir.
but
before
that
jury
was
sequestered,
all
of
those
people
who
saw
the
first
two
days,
not
all
of
them
but
at
large
number
of
them
saw
the
first
day's
broadcast.
in
that
broadcast,
they
were
told
of
the
things
this
man
was
accused
of.
they
were
shown
parts
that
somebody
not
sworn
had
monitored
and
picked
out
and
put
in
this
two-hour
broadcast
and
they
were
passing
on
in
advance,
is
this
man
is
guilty.
just
the
press
can
do
that
your
honor,
but
they
have
a
right
to
do
it,
but
you
have
the
right
to
object
to
a
thing
so
broadly
done
as
it's
done
with
tv.
the
educational
purposes
of
television
and
even
the
press
are
incidental
and
the
television
is
not
equipped
to
do
it
fairly.
it
cost
too
much
money.
probably
only
five
or
six
cases
a
year
are
televised.
they're
not
televised
unless
they
are
famous
defendants.
they
can't
spend
have
15
men
in
attendance
as
the
record
shows
they
had
here
and
spend
$150,000
in
the
ordinary
case.
so,
the
television
itself
is
not
equipped
to
do
what
these
people
say
we
want
to
do
and
the
lawyer
knows
that.
it's
recent,
it's
a
matter
of
public
knowledge
and
it's
recent
as
this
trial.
there
was
a
complete
report
of
about
how
he
misstated
his
liabilities
to
the
government.
they
put
it
in
full
for
two
days
of
the
testimony
of
the
government.
the
defendant
for
the
first
time
went
on
the
trial
and
gave
his
case
and
told
the
newspapers
didn't
mention
and
dallas
didn't
mention
the
case
that
day,
they
just
ignored
it.
one
of
the
paper
over
in
fort
worth
said
that
this
was
the
first
time
he'd
be
on
the
stand
in
the
three
cases
and
two
of
which
he'd
been
convicted.
the
court
was
required
to
call
in
all
the
jurors,
they
were
not
sequestered
in
the
federal
court
and
ask
each
one
of
them,
did
you
read
this
article
about
him
not
--
but
they
didn't
tell
what
it
was,
but
what
they've
said
that
he
had
not
testified
in
any
other
case,
his
reference
to
his
exercise
of
his
constitutional
rights.
of
course,
the
jury
said
they
hadn't
read
it.
so
the
court
sent
the
--
they
didn't
discharge
the
jury
and
the
jury
went
out
after
the
argument
and
acquitted
mr.
estes.
but
are
we
going
to
permit
the
television
to
broadcast
as
a
trial
they
see
so
that
the
court
will
have
to
come
in
and
interrogate
the
jurors
or
lock
them
up,
interrogate
him
as
they
did
in
our
--
in
the
kopitch
case
and
the
cases
where
the
cases
were
reversed
because
the
judge
didn't
interrogate
the
juror
and
asked
them
about
what
they
heard
or
what
they
saw
on
television.
so,
the
only
practical
means
of
enforcing
this
rule
of
fair
trial
and
a
standard
of
procedure
is
by
extending
it
to
texas
and
colorado
and
create
a
uniformity
in
the
treatment
of
cases.
now,
it's
not
going
to
be
a
great
amount
of
infringement
upon
freedom
of
speech
since
the
case
is
due
to
any
other
state
except
texas
and
colorado
anyways.
it's
not
going
to
infringe
freedom
of
speech
and
say,
“well
now,
you
can't
do
it
in
texas
and
you
can't
do
it
in
colorado.”
that's
not
going
to
hurt
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
press.
i
think
the
part
that
is
overlooked,
the
experiments
suggested
here
by
the
defendant,
the
empirical
approach,
let
the
bench,
bar
and
media
try
out
some
cases
or
so.
well,
if
they
will
just
say
let
the
defendant
be
a
part
of
that
and
determine
whether
or
not
he
wanted
to
be
experimented
on,
then
there
would
be
no
serious
objections.
it
would
violate
my
sense
of
propriety,
but
i'm
not
always
sure
that
i'm
right
on
my
adherence
to
canon
35.
your
honor,
i'll
proceed
--
i
will
not
proceed
further
now,
but
my
associate
will
use
the
few
minutes
we
have
left
in
rebuttal.
