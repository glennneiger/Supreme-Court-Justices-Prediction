justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
was
at
the
preliminary
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
do
i
understand
though
that
on
this
record,
something
happened
for
two
days
in
september
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
there
was
a
continuance
until
october?

[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
protect
the
jurors.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
the
fact
that
they
didn't
have
a
live
telecast
while
a
witness
was
on
the
stand.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
nevertheless
was
the
witnesses'
testimony
being
recorded
from
that
booth
in
the
rear
of
the
courtroom
that
the
model
showed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
wasn't
live
broadcast
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,

at
what,
news
programs
and
that
sort
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
by
counsel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
you
said
the
argument
was
not
broadcast?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
base
argument
was
broadcast.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
nothing
with
the
defendants
[inaudible]
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
cofer
may
i
get
one
thing
clear?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
or
was
not
the
whole
of
this
trial
filmed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
or
was
not
a
audio
taken
of
the
whole
film,
that
is
was
sound
taken
of
the
whole
of
the
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
mr.
cofer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
your
constitutional
claim
of
the
denial
of
a
fair
trial,
dependent
of
what
went
out
on
outside
of
the
courtroom
or
the
--
does
it
rest
at
least
alternatively
on
the
simple
proposition
that
what
happened
in
the
courtroom
itself
prejudiced
a
fair
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
it
entirely
that
that,
what
you
told
us
went
on
in
the
courtroom,
the
filming
from
this
thing
in
the
back
of
the
courtroom.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

[inaudible]
go
home
at
night.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
during
the
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
mr.
attorney
general,
would
that
include
telecast
of
witnesses
sitting
in
the
witness
stand?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
when
you
get
to
it
if
you
will.
how
much
the
participants
in
the
trial,
witnesses,
jurors,
counsel,
judge,
knew
of
actually
what
was
going
on
and
the
limitation
you
just
mentioned
namely
that
there
was
no
actual
recording
of
the
testimony.
how
much
do
they
know
of
with
regards
of
this
case
in
the
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
here,
could
we?
is
it
part
of
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
just
a
mechanical
question
mr.
attorney,
how
can
we
see
that,
that
takes
special
equipment
and
then
we
have
to
go
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
means
going
to
some
broadcasting.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
parties
have
any
suggestion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where,
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
is
that
part
on
the
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
in
fact
live
in
the
witnesses
that
testified
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
it's
closed
off?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
none
of
the
witnesses
testified
at
least
with
that
mic
as
recorded
in
the
back?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
the
way
i
looked
at
those
pictures,
certainly
that's
not
--
i
think
that
would
be
true
that
it
was
made
--
the
microphones
in
that
--
those
two
[inaudible]
wasn't
it?m
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
using
photographs
that
looked
a
lot
different
on
the
24th
and
25th
of
september
from
the
photographs
taken
on
the
october
22nd.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no.
i'm
probably
wrong,
but
i
certainly
saw
there
is
a
whole
stack
of
these
pictures
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
many
cameras
are
actually
included
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
four.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
they
all
--
were
they
working
simultaneously?
you
mentioned
they
had
a
pooled
basis
operation
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
all
four
working
at
the
same
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
live.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
in
your
brief
mr.
jaworski?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
didn't
follow
it.
do
you
happen
to
know
where?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
mr.
jaworski
there
[inaudible]
if
this
jury
had
not
been
sequestered?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
does
suggest
then
doesn't
it
to
what
mr.
justice
stewart
said.
my
problem
here
is
not
whether
canon
35
is
a
constitutionally
ruled,
it's
whether
in
the
circumstances
these
applied.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
like
how
do
you
think,
you
think
if
on
this
record
you
say
that
this
violated
the
right
for
a
fair
trial,
it
would
tantamount
to
make
canon
35.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
elevates
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
in
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
don't
understand
mr.
cofer,
i
thought
the
attorney
general
said
that
that
mic
he
pointed
out
on
the
witness
box
which
would
have
recorded
that
the
machine
from
the
back
in
the
courtroom
had
been
made
dead,
had
been
cut
off
so
that
it
wasn't
possible
for
any
recording.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
did
they
do,
cut
in
on
it
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
was
it
--
isn't
it
--
was
this
just
below
or
you
were
using
the
same
microphone
that
the
other
facility
is
using,
the
courtroom
microphone?
the
courtroom
microphone,
that
was
--
