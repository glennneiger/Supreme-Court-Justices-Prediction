justice
potter
stewart
but
was
the
witness
or
was
--
what
was
taken
in
the
way
of
a
tape
of
any
witness
testimony
was
that
later
broadcast?
justice
potter
stewart
well
what
you're
saying
now
applies
to
journalist
generally.
justice
potter
stewart
in
fact
there
is
more
to
journalism
than
does
to
what
happened
here
because
here
was
at
least
a
--
it
couldn't
be
a
--
an
accurate
portrayal
of
what
actually
went
on
and
there
was
no
room
for
misreporting
here,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
cofer
do
you
think
a
lawyer
for
a
defendant
in
criminal
case
could
keep
a
newspaperman
out
of
the
courtroom?
justice
potter
stewart
you
just
told
us
that
his
decision
is
paramount,
paramount
to
everything
else.
justice
potter
stewart
why
not,
if
what
you
told
us
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
(voice
overlap)
you
do
think
that
if
a
defendant's
lawyer
if
he
objected
to
keep
the
newspaper
man
out
of
the
courtroom
during
a
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
still
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
answer
to
your
question
if
you've
given
it
to
me.
you
just
--
you
told
us
a
few
minutes
ago
that
the
decision
of
defense
counsel
is
paramount
to
everything
else
in
a
criminal
case.
now
if
defense
counsel
thought
that
it
would
help
his
client's
cause
to
exclude
all
newspaper
men
from
the
trial,
would
that
--
would
his
objection
in
your
judgment
prevail
over
everything
else?
justice
potter
stewart
what
made
you
say
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
do
you
base
that,
that
he
was
being
published
throughout
the
world
as
a
guilty
man?
justice
potter
stewart
well
this
is
true
and
whenever
there's
a
picture
of
anybody
who
has
been
indicted?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
just
--
my
question
was
direct
--
justice
potter
stewart
why
is
this
--
why
does
the
televising
of
this
trial
make
anybody
think
he
was
less
entitled
to
the
ordinary
procedural
safeguards
of
a
defendant,
that
is
the
presumption
and
so
on
than
the
trial
had
not
been
televised,
that's
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
defendant
if
wanted
to
keep
the
newspaper
men
out
of
the
trial,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
how
was
that
made
possible
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
how
was
that
made
possible
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let
me
--
let
me
just
pursue
my
question
for
a
moment.
you
said
that
you
implied
that
what
happened
here
remitted
the
guilt
of
this
man
to
be
determined
not
by
the
jury
but
in
the
marketplace.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
wanted
to
apply
that
it
wasn't
made
possible
in
this
case.
as
i
understand
it,
the
jury
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
jury
was
sequestered
in
the
case,
were
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
the
pictures
are
in
the
printed
record
are
they?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
i
may
require.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
in
the
original
record
so
i
suppose
they
just
wanted
each
picture
--
one
copy
of
each
pictures.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
though
i
have
them
here.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
you
told
us
that
the
members
of
jury
were
completely
sequestered
from
the
time
the
panel
was
selected?
justice
potter
stewart
until
after
their
verdict
was
returned
and
mechanically,
how
does
that
work
in
austin?
this
is
an
austin,
texas.
justice
potter
stewart
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
county
seat
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
now
what
happens
when
they
go
out?
justice
potter
stewart
they
get
together?
they
go
to
a
public
place
to
eat
in
the
presence
and
escorted
by
bailiffs?
justice
potter
stewart
did
they
go
in
a
group
in
a
body?
justice
potter
stewart
and
with
nobody
else
there
except
the
officers
of
the
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
look
after
them?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
what
happens
in
the
evening
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
in
a
local
hotel
or
boarding
house?
justice
potter
stewart
there
are,
there
are
sleeping
accommodations
in
the
courthouse?
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
did
this
trial
last,
how
many
days?
justice
potter
stewart
about
two
weeks?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
weekends,
what
happened
to
the
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
told
us
that
no
television
was
available
in
the
--
in
these
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
you've
tendered
these
affidavits
to
the
court.
they're
there
in
the
table
--
have
we
physically
got
any
evidence
that
you
know
of
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
canon
35
isn't
before
us
here
at
all.
what
is
before
us
is
that
whether
what
happened
to
this
trial
has
violated
this
petitioner's
right
to
due
process
of
law.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
that's
the
point
you're
making.
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
same
token
mr.
jaworski.
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
you're
not
contending
that
at
the
level
of
dignity,
decorum,
judicial
propriety,
judicial
ethics
and
wisdom
that
you're
not
contending
that
this
will
attack
its
rule,
its
practice
if
necessarily
very
good
or
wise,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
none
of
that
is
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
that's
an
exception
to
what
i
just
heard.
the
press
photographers
are
allowed
in
the
courtroom
and
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
interference
or
disruption
that
they
may
have
caused
--
is
that
--
that
question
is
not
at
all
covered
by
the
limited
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
i
just
have
petition
before
me.
i
didn't
know
where
it
was
and
if
so,
it
would
be
understood.
here
is
what
question
two
says.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
the
action
of
the
trial
court
over
petitioners
continued
objection,
denied
in
due
process
of
law
and
equal
protection
of
the
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
sates
in
requiring
petitioners
to
submit
to
live
television
of
his
trial
and
in
refusing
to
adopt
in
this
all
out
publicity
case
as
the
old
trial
procedure,
canon
35
of
the
canon
of
judicial
ethics
of
the
american
bar
association
and
instead
adopting
and
following
over
the
defendant's
objection,
canon
28
of
the
canon
of
judicial
ethics
since
approved
by
the
judicial
section
of
the
integrated
state
bar
of
texas.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
