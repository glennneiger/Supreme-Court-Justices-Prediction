mr.
waggoner
carr
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
in
the
very
beginning
in
this
case
including
the
filing
of
the
briefs,
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
misunderstanding
as
we
see
it
as
to
the
actual
facts
in
this
case.
and
if
you
will
permit
me,
i
would
like
to
pick
what
time
is
necessary
in
the
time
that
i
have
here
to
go
into
the
facts
in
a
chronological
order
so
that
i
might
be
sure
the
court
understands
everything
that's
happened.
now
we're
willing
to
be
judged
on
the
facts,
but
we
certainly
want
the
facts
well
known.
may
i
pull
one
fact
out
of
context
here
due
to
the
questions
placed
from
the
bench
today
and
make
it
clear
to
the
court
that
no
part
of
the
testimony
of
any
witness
was
recorded,
no
part
of
it
was
ever
recorded
and
that
none
of
it
was
recorded
for
later
playback
during
the
trial,
the
broadcast
people,
the
radio
people
voir
dire
if
they
so
desire
sit
in
the
audience,
take
notes,
go
out
and
make
comments
on
later
broadcast.
there
was
no
broadcast
taking
place
at
that
time
nor
was
there
any
recording.
mr.
waggoner
carr
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir
they
took
film
without
sound,
periodically.
mr.
waggoner
carr
they
would
later
use
it
if
they
wanted
to
and
later
broadcast
or
televise
broadcast
on
regular
televised
news
broadcast
later.
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir,
film
without
sound,
but
not
regularly
as
was
brought
out
here.
not
consistently,
not
every
minute,
just
if
they
so
desire
and
as
i'm
going
to
explain
to
you
all
of
these
pictures
were
taken
from
the
booth.
i'll
get
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
waggoner
carr
well,
i
might
say
to
you
that
of
course
the
judge
gave
them
the
right
to
televise
under
his
instructions
that
is
to
take
film
without
sound
is
very
specific.
he
ordered
them
to
take
all
of
the
pictures
during
the
trial
on
its
merits
from
the
booth
but
nowhere
else
and
i'm
going
to
bring
this
out
in
the
argument
i
think.
if
not,
i
will
certainly.
mr.
waggoner
carr
no
soundtracks,
no
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
except
the
arguments
of
the
state.
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
they
didn't
hold
it
mr.
justice?
they
rendered
their
verdict.
they
brought
the
verdict
to
the
court.
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
that
was
live
telecast.
mr.
waggoner
carr
no,
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
the
argument
of
the
first
state's
attorney,
there
were
two,
was
broadcast
sound,
but
not
video.
they
had
the
right
to
do
it,
but
something
went
wrong.
so
no
picture
was
transmitted,
but
sound
was
transmitted
of
the
first
on.
mr.
waggoner
carr
on
the
second
state's
attorney
argument
that
was
telecast
video
and
sound.
now
the
petitioners
or
the
defendant's
attorney's
arguments
were
not
broadcast
or
recorded
by
video
or
sound
at
their
request.
they
objected
the
court
on
their
objection.
mr.
waggoner
carr
mr.
justice
--
mr.
justice
white,
i'm
not
certain
whether
it
was
every
minute
or
not.
the
record
does
show
that
they
had
the
right
to
do
it
as
long
as
they
didn't
take
pictures
of
these
two
gentlemen.
mr.
waggoner
carr
i
don't
recall
that
it
was
in
the
record.
i
do
recall
a
statement
like
that
in
one
of
the
briefs.
yes
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
mr.
cofer
and
the
two
mr.
cofer's
--
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
he
was
--
he
was
photographed
during,
i
imagine,
during
the
film
without
sound.
if
they
wanted
to,
they
had
the
right
to
do
it
from
the
rear
and
of
course
you
must
distinguish
between
the
trial
on
the
merits
and
the
pre-trial
hearing
which
i
want
to
distinguish
which
i
will
now
deal
with,
if
you
don't
mind.
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
i'm
advised
that
it
is.
i
wasn't
quite
sure.
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
waggoner
carr
there
wasn't
any
videotape
taken
except
the
pretrial.
mr.
waggoner
carr
i
think
that's
here
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
i
think
that's
before
you.
mr.
waggoner
carr
well,
i
think
you
--
i
think
from
what
the
judge
has
told
me,
i
would
be
subject
to
being
disputed
by
mr.
cofer
who
was
going
to
close
that
there
was
very
little
of
this
during
the
actual
trial
itself.
mr.
waggoner
carr
it
was
a
film
sir.
it
was
a
film
without
sound
during
the
trial.
mr.
waggoner
carr
the
video?
it's
a
video,
yes.
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir,
you
have
[inaudible]
with
special
equipment,
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
well
sir,
that
is
a
mechanical
problem
that
you
have.
i'll
have
to
solve
that
if
i
can.
i
don't
know
how
to
do
it.
mr.
waggoner
carr
as
to
how
you
might
see
it?
mr.
waggoner
carr
we
can
certainly
counsel
that
those
that
have
equipment
and
see
what
can
be
done,
i
would
be
very
happy
to
do
that.
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
so.
i'm
not
interested.
i'm
advised
that
arrangements
have
been
made
for
a
close
circuit
showing
to
you
if
you
desire
to
see
this
video.
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
sir,
that's
all
i
think,
yes
sir.
now
sir,
if
i
might
say,
a
moment
ago
it
was
suggested
that
all
of
the
facts
are
agreed
upon.
this
is
correct.
in
each
case,
the
bill
of
exceptions
would
be
presented
by
mr.
cofer.
they
would
be
read
and
qualified
by
the
court
and
then
in
every
instance,
mr.
cofer
would
agree
to
the
qualifications
of
the
court.
so
what
you
have
is
an
agreed
statement
of
facts.
i'm
going
to
try
to
state
these
to
you
very
quickly.
you'll
also
find
them
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
which
is
the
highest
court
in
texas
in
criminal
matters
and
a
portion
of
this
appears
on
page
136
and
137
of
the
record
on
file
on
this
court.
now,
this
case
was
set
for
trial
in
the
beginning
on
september
24,
1962.
on
september
the
24th
and
the
next
day,
the
25th,
a
pretrial
hearing
was
held
by
the
trial
court
on
two
motions,
two
motions
that
were
filed
by
the
petitioner.
one
motion
was
that
no
telecast
of
the
trial
be
permitted
and
the
other
motion
was
for
continuance.
at
the
conclusion
of
this
hearing,
the
trial
court
overruled
the
petitioner's
motion
that
the
trial
not
be
telecast
and
granted
the
motion
for
a
continuance
and
reset
the
trial
for
october
22nd
about
a
month
later,
1962,
due
to
the
absence
of
certain
defendant's
witnesses.
now,
the
trial
court
permitted
live
telecast
of
the
pretrial
proceedings
on
these
two
motions.
however,
there
was
not
any
evidence
nor
was
there
any
testimony
offered
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
the
only
testimony
offered
was
in
support
of
the
defendant's
motion
to
prevent
telecasting,
broadcasting
by
radio
or
press
photography.
there
was
no
testimony
offered
on
the
motion
for
a
continuance
other
than
the
mere
calling
of
the
witnesses'
names
and
the
filing
of
the
motion.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
practically
all
of
the
complaints
heard
from
counsel
or
the
petitioner
and
various
of
the
amici
curiae
briefs
are
related
to
this
pretrial
hearing
before
the
judge,
which
determined
only
those
two
matters
of
procedure
and
the
preliminary
matters
did
not
in
any
manner
include
any
evidence
or
even
any
statement
by
counsel
as
to
the
pertinent
facts
in
the
case
since
it
was
not
to
be
tried
at
this
particular
time
nor
was
any
comment
made
as
to
the
guilt
or
the
innocence
of
the
defendant.
now,
i
would
like
to
specifically
point
out
to
this
court's
attention
that
on
page
63
of
the
record,
you
will
find
testimony
by
mr.
hume
cofer,
co-counsel
for
the
petitioner,
concerning
the
petitioner's
objection
to
the
presence
of
cameras
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
cofer
expressly
admitted
under
oath
at
that
time
that
this
televised
pretrial
hearing
gave
no
prospective
juror
any
knowledge
about
the
facts
of
this
case
nor
any
knowledge
of
any
of
the
evidence.
this
was
under
oath
by
mr.
cofer
himself,
page
63
of
the
record.
the
record
bears
out
also
that
judge
dunagan's
statement,
who
was
the
trial
judge,
which
appears
on
page
106
of
the
record
filed
herein
that
“prospective
jurors
and
others
in
the
smith
county
or
any
other
place
did
not
learn
anymore
than
they
already
knew
and
they
didn't
learn
anymore
from
the
tv
and
radio
and
they
had
learned
from
the
press
which
was
that
the
defendant
had
been
brought
to
smith
county
for
trial,
that
the
trial
was
called
or
the
case
was
called
rather,
that
the
defendant
had
filed
a
motion
to
exclude
cameras,
that
he
had
filed
a
motion
for
continuance
and
that
the
witnesses'
names
were
recalled
and
the
numbers
were
missing.”
mr.
waggoner
carr
he
was
there
during
the
latter
part,
yes,
not
all
the
time,
but
they're
part
of
the
time.
now
counsel
for
the
petitioner
does
not
claim
these
facts
to
be
any
different
in
the
record
than
what
i've
stated
to
you
right
here.
now
if
you
would
allow
me,
i
would
like
to
read
judge
dunagan's
statement
appearing
on
page
34
of
the
record
and
i
quote.
“in
the
past,
it
has
been
the
policy
of
this
court
to
permit
televising
in
the
courtroom
under
the
rules
and
the
supervision
of
this
court.”
heretofore,
i
have
not
encountered
any
difficulty
with
it.
i
was
unable
to
observe
any
detraction
from
the
witnesses
or
the
attorneys
in
those
cases”
and
then
i
continue
to
quote,
“i
had
the
privilege
yesterday
morning
of
sitting
in
my
home
and
viewing
the
sermon
by
the
first
baptist
church
over
in
dallas
and
certainly,
it
wasn't
any
circus
in
that
church
and
i
feel
that
if
any
television,
is
a
proper
instrument
in
the
house
of
the
lord,
it
is
not
out
of
place
in
this
courtroom
if
properly
supervised.”
and
then
in
denying
the
petitioner's
motion
to
exclude
television,
judge
dunagan
said
this
and
i
thought
this
would
be
of
interest
to
the
court.
“there
has
been
one
consideration
that
the
court
has
given
and
it
is
that
this
is
a
small
courtroom
and
there
will
be
hundreds
of
people
trying
to
get
into
this
courtroom
to
witness
this
trial.”
mr.
waggoner
carr
let's
see
sir,
starting
on
page
34.
i'm
not
sure
what
i'm
quoting
here
is
on
page
34,
but
this
whole
thing
started
on
34.
mr.
waggoner
carr
and
i'll
begin
over
here.
“there
was
one
consideration
that
the
court
has
given
and
it
is
that
this
is
a
small
courtroom
and
there
will
be
hundreds
of
people
trying
to
get
into
this
courtroom
to
witness
this
trial.
i
believe
we
would
have
less
confusion
if
they
would
stay
at
home
and
stay
out
of
the
courtroom
and
look
in
on
the
trial
with
all
of
those
people
trying
to
crowd
in
and
push
into
this
courtroom
that
is
another
consideration
i
have
given
to
it,
meaning
television.”
now
prior
to
the
merits
of
the
case
which
began
on
the
trial
on
the
merits,
the
court
case
was
continued
until
october
22nd.
on
the
first
day,
october
22nd,
again
they
went
into
these
preliminary
matters
so
they
didn't
get
to
any
of
the
merits
on
the
22nd.
but
prior
to
the
22nd,
there
was
booth
constructed
and
placed
in
the
rear
of
the
courtroom
which
was
painted
the
same
or
near
the
same
color
as
the
courtroom
with
a
small
opening
across
the
top
for
the
use
of
cameras.
now
you
have
before
you
state's
exhibit
8
which
is
a
part
of
the
record
here.
this
is
a
photograph
of
this
booth
as
it
actually
existed.
that
depicts
the
physical
appearance
of
the
booth
upon
the
convening
of
court
at
9
am.
on
october
23rd,
which
condition
continued
and
remained
the
same
throughout
the
trial.
now
this
was
the
date
and
the
time
of
day
that
the
jury
panel
reported
for
duty
and
voir
dire
of
the
jury
panel
began.
i
would
like
if
i
might
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
model
behind
me,
i'm
not
sure
how
good
you
can
see
it
but
you
will
have
it
before
you
from
now
on,
that
includes
the
camera
booth
that
was
constructed
and
we
wanted
to
have
this
for
you,
because
we
thought
it
might
be
easier
for
you
to
see
even
just
by
the
description
of
words.
if
i
might
--
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir,
right
here.
now
we
have
--
i
don't
know
whether
you
can
hear
me
sir,
if
you
can't,
i'll
be
glad
to
accept
it,
we
have
made
this
part
here
removable
so
that
you
might
better
see
it.
this
is
drawn
on
a
direct
scale
of
3/4
of
an
inch
to
a
foot.
now
this
is
in
our
opinion,
a
very
near
replica
and
you
have
a
certification
for
that
effect
by
the
people
who
made
--
made
it
of
the
exact
courtroom.
this
is
the
way
the
courtroom
appeared
at
the
time
of
the
pretrial
on
september
24th
and
25th
before
the
booth
was
constructed.
at
that
time,
these
two
--
between
the
24th
and
25th
of
september
and
a
month
later
when
the
trial
actually
started
on
its
merits,
two
of
these
seats
here
were
removed
and
placed
upfront
in
the
courtroom
where
they
had
plenty
of
room
and
this
booth
was
constructed
as
you
can
see
there
and
placed
there
the
same
color
as
the
rest
of
the
courtroom
with
a
little
aperture
opening
across
the
top,
where
the
cameras
could
view
the
courtroom,
but
everything
would
be
behind
the
wall
of
the
petitioner.
now
on
the
23rd,
the
judge
calls
to
be
placed
in
this
aperture
a
further
closing
of
it,
because
he
found
that
the
cameras
could
operate
there,
all
right,
and
still
he
could
close
off
any
activity
that
might
be
behind
the
wall
of
the
booth
so
as
to
be
sure
or
surer
that
nothing
occurred
that
would
prevent
a
fair
trial.
now,
if
i
might
put
this
around
just
a
little
one
other
--
one
other
thing.
you've
heard
a
lot
about
microphones,
this
is
an
exact
replica
of
the
microphone.
there
were
six
microphones
in
that
courtroom.
there
are
10
here
in
your
courtroom.
three
of
those
courtroom
microphones
are
on
the
judges
desks.
three
were
on
the
witnesses'
desk
or
the
witnesses'
chair
right
before
him.
this
is
a
modern
courtroom
as
you
can
see,
but
it's
much
like
the
facilities
you
have
here
because
two
of
these
three
microphones
in
each
case,
meaning
two
on
the
judges'
desk
and
two
on
the
witnesses'
stand
were
the
ordinary
microphonic
equipment
of
the
courtroom
itself.
one
microphone,
this
little
one
right
here
which
i'm
sure
you
can
see
from
where
you
are,
the
little
flat
one,
went
to
the
keeping
of
the
record
by
the
clerk
and
this
is
where
the
testimony
went
to
be
recorded.
the
other
microphone
that
was
--
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir,
rather
than
by
the
court
reporter,
rather
than
to
take
it
--
well
i
think
maybe
it's
a
duplication,
maybe
he
takes
it
down
in
some
cases,
but
he
always
backs
up
his
accuracy
by
complete
recording
of
every
word.
this
is
--
this
is
in
every
case.
then
one
of
the
regular
microphones
on
the
judges'
desks
and
one
of
the
two
microphones
that
i've
mentioned
to
you
on
the
witnesses'
stand
is
connected
to
five
little
broadcast
outlets
over
here
on
the
inside
of
the
jury
box,
which
was
simply
to
enable
a
jury
to
better
hear
the
judge
and
the
witness.
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
no
sir.
this
is
a
permanent
part
of
that
courtroom.
mr.
waggoner
carr
that's
correct.
mr.
waggoner
carr
no
sir.
it
just
goes
right
here,
just
loudspeaker
system
so
that
you
can
hear
better.
the
other
remaining
microphone
was
the
only
microphone
that
was
added
in
that
courtroom
for
this
trial.
this
microphone,
the
third
microphone
was
a
tool
microphone
which
supplies
the
sound
to
the
cameras
back
here.
the
only
microphone
they
all
--
they're
all
into
the
same
microphone
and
when
they
were
allowed
to
broadcast
like
during
the
argument,
this
is
a
microphone
that
picked
up
the
sound
wave
both
here
at
the
witness
stand
or
they
turn
them
around
somewhere.
mr.
waggoner
carr
well,
this
was
placed
in
there
and
the
--
during
the
pretrial
mr.
justice,
during
the
pretrial
when
they
were
recording
this
and
it
just
never
was
taken
out.
mr.
waggoner
carr
no
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
no
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
that's
correct
sir.
the
fact
stands
as
i
originally
said
as
to
what
was
transcribed
or
what
was
broadcast
and
what
was
not,
but
this,
i'm
just
explaining
here
what
the
--
what
they
were
for.
when
the
radio
people
were
broadcasting
in
the
pretrial
and
in
the
arguments,
they
used
the
court
microphone.
this
is
only
important
insofar
as
you
might
know
that
as
some
newspaper
articles
wrote
it,
a
great
maze
and
forest
of
microphones
that
existed
in
the
courtroom.
this
is
the
true
picture.
mr.
waggoner
carr
this
was
exactly
what
we
had
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
i
think
--
i
think
if
you
will,
i
don't
want
to
dispute
your
words.
you
might
be
accurate.
mr.
waggoner
carr
now,
they
have
here
some
cameras,
you
might
have
that
in
your
mind
of
a
pretrial.
they
had
cameras;
they
had
another
microphone
over
here,
yes
sir,
you're
exactly
right.
they
had
another
microphone
over
here
near
the
jury
box.
mr.
waggoner
carr
no
sir.
i
have
two
comments
to
make
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
waggoner
carr
one
is
that
this
is
the
point
we
want
to
make
that
a
picture
is
much
more
accurate
than
a
description
of
a
man
who
gives
his
opinion
of
whether
it
was
a
forest
or
snaking
or
whatever
it
might
be.
but
regardless
of
what
he
said,
he's
talking
about
the
pretrial
on
september
24th.
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir,
yes.
mr.
waggoner
carr
well,
i'm
going
to
tell
you.
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir.
i'm
going
to
refer
it
i
think
more
accurately
than
my
describing
it
is
to
refer
you
to
the
pictures
that
are
in
your
record
of
the
situation
as
it
exactly
existed
on
the
24th.
you
have
plenty
of
these
in
your
record
sir
--
mr.
waggoner
carr
--
which
are
far
more
accurate
and
there
was
more
confusion
on
that
day
than
what
i
have
described
here.
this
is
actually
what
took
place
in
october
when
the
merits
of
the
case
was
tried.
mr.
waggoner
carr
no
sir,
no
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
you
just
have
them
and
they're
loose
and
so
designated
as
state's
exhibits
are
defendant's
exhibits.
mr.
waggoner
carr
we
can
furnish
you
any
number
that
you
want.
mr.
waggoner
carr
what
we
want
to
try
to
make
on
that
first
hearing
is
on
september
24th
and
25th
is
that
no
testimony
was
given
at
that
time.
nobody
learned
anything
about
the
facts
of
the
case
and
it's
been
so
certified
to
by
mr.
cofer.
now
if
i
may
hurry
on.
live
telecasting
and
radio
broadcasting
were
not
permitted
during
the
trial
itself
prior
to
the
arguments
of
state's
counsel.
the
only
telecasting
was
on
film
without
sound
and
this
was
not
a
continuous
camera
operation,
but
pictures
were
taken
at
intervals
during
the
debate
to
be
used
on
regular
newscast
later
in
the
day.
the
court
did
not
permit
any
cameras
other
than
those
that
were
noiseless
nor
were
floodlights
and
flash
bulbs
allowed
to
be
used
in
the
courtroom,
just
ordinary
light.
the
cameras
were
used
on
a
pooled
basis.
the
court
did
not
permit
any
telecasting
or
photographing
in
the
hallways
leading
into
the
courtroom
or
even
anywhere
on
the
second
floor
of
the
courthouse
where
the
courtroom
is
situated.
mr.
waggoner
carr
there
are
four
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
well,
here
--
mr.
waggoner
carr
well
sir,
they
would
go
on
and
off.
you
had
--
i
had
one
that
was
allowed
for
each
one
of
the
national
line
abc,
cbs
and
nbc,
then
you
had
one
pool
for
all
of
the
local
tv
stations,
that's
the
way
you
arrive
at
the
pool
and
--
and
there
was
one
--
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir,
one
live
and
the
rest
of
them
during
the
other
time.
mr.
waggoner
carr
sir,
your
record
goes
into
that
quite
a
bit
into
this.
there
were
regular
ads
on
television
during
the
day.
this
--
this
telecast
or
videotape
or
live
broadcast
or
live
television
was
not
sold
on
the
basis
that
when
you
buy
an
ad
and
the
bill
is
all
that's
in
this
case.
these
were
regular
ads
that
were
sold
before
this
even
took
place.
mr.
waggoner
carr
oh,
no
sir.
there
is
–
it
operated
just
like
a
newspaper.
newspaper
sales
ads
to
stay
in
business
and
so
did
the
tv
station
noted.
mr.
waggoner
carr
no
sir,
not
for
that
specific
purpose,
if
that's
what
you
mean
sir.
yes,
right
now,
you
will
find
in
here
and
i
prefer
not
to
take
my
time.
i
will
if
it
becomes
important
to
you
as
to
how
many
were
--
how
many
ads
were
sold
for
two-hour
duration.
for
example,
you'll
find
that
one
time
for
an
hour
and
a
half
on
tuesday
morning
that
during
the
preliminaries
there
were
no
ads
at
all,
otherwise
they
were
just
ordinary
ads
that
were
placed
in
the
regular
commercial
business
of
television.
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir.
the
--
the
--
they
had
--
during
the
day
when
they
were
live
broadcasting,
of
course,
they
would
have
to
replace.
during
the
preliminaries
when
they
were
live,
during
the
rest
of
the
time
when
it
was
film
on
sound
as
i
recall,
the
record
will
show
that,
that
was
just
a
regular
news
broadcast.
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
if
there
had
been
a
soundtrack?
mr.
waggoner
carr
well
sir,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
know.
we
haven't
--
we
haven't
gotten
into
that
simply
because
they
were
not
a
part
of
this
case.
mr.
waggoner
carr
well,
if
--
mr.
waggoner
carr
it
might
sir.
it
might
have
in
my
opinion,
might
have
changed
things
if
the
witnesses
had
been
able
to
view
what
other
witnesses
had
said
on
the
stand,
heard
them
testify,
because
the
witnesses
were
under
the
rule
which
in
our
state
means
that
they
can't
talk
to
anyone
about
what
they
testified
to
nor
listen
in
on
the
other
people's
testimony.
now
if
we'd
have
that
kind
of
situation,
we've
might
have
had
something
to
worry
about,
but
that's
the
reason
and
the
court
so
states
in
here,
this
is
the
reason
that
he
wouldn't
allow
the
witnesses'
testimony
to
be
a
soundtrack
or
televised
live
for
this
very
reason.
mr.
waggoner
carr
may
i
say
this
also,
and
something
here
to
end
as
quickly
as
possible
that
the
appellant,
i'm
quoting
now
from
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
it's
decision
affirming
the
conviction
of
mr.
estes
and
it
states
this.
“the
contention
that
appellant
was
denied
full
and
adequate
representation
because
of
his
counsel's
belief
in
canon
35
of
the
american
bar
association,
barring
photographs
in
the
courtroom
or
broadcasting
or
telecasting
court
proceedings
is
not
borne
out
by
the
record.”
and
then
the
court
says
this,
“of
the
many
cases
coming
to
this
court,
we
know
of
no
case
where
the
accused
received
better
or
more
efficient
representation
than
did
the
appellant
in
the
present
case
and
at
this
point,
because
of
the
allegations
in
the
opposing
briefs
that
the
jurors
hearing
this
case
were
subject
to
being
influenced
by
television
reports
or
by
other
such
voice
of
juror's
is
already
been
brought
out
and
under
our
code
of
criminal
procedure,
jury
such
as
this
are
locked
up
and
kept
together
and
they
are
absolutely
immune
from
seeing
television,
hearing
radio
reports
or
reading
newspaper
are
particularly
seen
wise.
there
was
no
way
for
these
jurors
to
get
any
information
that
might
influence
their
verdict
as
a
result
of
the
television
or
broadcasting
of
these
proceeding.”
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not.
i
could
have
asked
him
but
i
didn't,
just
because
it
didn't
come
to
mind
but
i
know
that
he
has
several.
mr.
waggoner
carr
he's
had
several
and
he's
not
the
only
court
in
our
states
that
has
done
it.
of
course
in
the
state
bar
of
texas
amicus
curiae
brief,
you
will
find
one
of
our
celebrated
cases
there,
waco
at
the
washburn
case,
the
murder
case
was
televised
live
where
the
cameras
were
played
on
the
witnesses
at
all
time,
but
this
never
did
reach
like
this
one
has.
now
sir,
we
have
obtained
affidavits
from
each
of
the
jurors
which
affidavits
are
hereby
tendered
to
the
court.
we'll
leave
them
here
for
you
to
see.
we
thought
this
would
be
important
since
the
allegations
are
being
made
in
the
different
briefs
that
the
--
that
the
jurors
where
could
have
been
influenced
by
this
or
that.
these
sworn
affidavits
were
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
counsel
for
petitioner
on
the
date
the
respondent's
brief
was
filed
with
this
honorable
court.
these
affidavits
reveal
that
the
jurors
were
scarcely
aware
of
the
presence
of
the
cameras
on
the
courtroom
during
the
actual
trial,
so
well
were
the
rules
[inaudible]
yes
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
no,
this
was
entirely
to
the
[inaudible]
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes.
mr.
waggoner
carr
from
the
moment
sir
that
the
jury,
a
juror,
a
particular
juror
is
selected
from
that
very
moment,
he
is
put
in
the
jury
room
to
wait
the
selection
of
the
entire
jury
from
that
moment
on
he
is
kept
together
with
the
other
jurors
under
surveillance
of
bailiffs
even
when
they
eat.
mr.
waggoner
carr
they
go
in
a
body
in
the
presence
of
bailiffs,
when
at
night
--
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir.
they
could
or
they
could
--
it's
where
they
saw
it
a
long
ago
and
where
it's
safe
and
where
the
court
will
approve
it.
mr.
waggoner
carr
in
a
group
--
yes
sir,
under
our
laws,
they
have
to
go
in
a
group.
mr.
waggoner
carr
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
we
have
a
provision
in
our
statutes
where
the
men
are
separated
from
the
women
equal
quarters
for
each
but
under
the
surveillance
again.
mr.
waggoner
carr
no
sir
in
the
courtroom,
in
the
courthouse.
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
all
that
i
know
of,
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
they
keep
them
right
there.
mr.
waggoner
carr
it
lasted
from
--
on
its
merits
from
october
23rd
and
i
believe
the
verdict
was
brought
in
on
november
7.
mr.
waggoner
carr
yes
sir.
mr.
waggoner
carr
they're
kept
there.
mr.
waggoner
carr
no
television
was
available
mr.
justice
except
one
time
during
the
elections
november
4th,
i
believe
it
was.
both
mr.
cofer
and
the
court
and
the
prosecutors
agreed
that
a
television
set
could
be
put
in
the
juror's
room
and
provided
that
the
bailiff
was
there
and
would
turn
it
off
at
the
end
of
--
in
case
of
any
ads
or
any
news
reports
or
anything
of
that
type
puts
it
in.
that
was
an
agreed
matter.
we
had
one
case
where
one
of
the
jurors
wanted
to
have
his
bible
there.
he
complains
in
these
affidavits
as
you
will
see
about
the
difficulty
of
getting
his
bible
because
the
judge
was
so
intent
on
seeing
that
there
were
no
notes
or
scribbled
issues
in
there
that
might
cause
trouble
there.
he
comments
about
this.
he's
very
carefully
supervised.
they
on
occasion
were
given
newspapers
over
the
weekend
for
example
as
you
speak
but
before
that
newspaper
was
put
in
there,
the
judge
himself
went
over
every
bit
of
it
and
cut
it
out
anything
pertaining
to
the
trial
and
he
did
that
himself
and
one
of
the
jurors
remarks
that
there
was
hardly
anything
left
but
we
were
glad
to
get
what
we
could
[laughter]
mr.
waggoner
carr
we
have
as
of
today
sir.
we
thought
--
we
didn't
know
exactly
how
to
handle
this
to
be
frank
with
you
and
--.
mr.
waggoner
carr
we
didn't
want
to
do
anything
that
the
court
might
object
to
by
mail,
so
we
thought
today
we
would
offer
it
and
they
are
here
and
copies
and
sufficient
copies
for
all.
mr.
waggoner
carr
we
don't
know
that.
mr.
waggoner
carr
may
i
say
this
one
statement
and
then
i'll
leave
sir.
we
respectfully
suggest
that
the
answer
to
the
problem
that
televising
trials
does
not
lie
in
barring
all
cameras
from
the
courtroom
and
the
final
analysis
and
responsibility
for
assuring
a
fair
trial
remains
with
the
presiding
judge.
it
is
his
responsibility
to
keep
the
press
under
reasonable
control
to
keep
spectators
under
reasonable
control
and
similarly,
he
should
exercise
a
responsibility
of
keeping
television
under
responsible
control.
the
opposing
counsel
in
his
brief
and
in
his
argument
have
adopted
and
has
adopted
the
imaginary
reasoning
if
i
might
say
so
of
that
nursery
book
character
henny
penny
who,
when
an
acorn
fell
on
her
head
from
the
tree
above
went
around
cockling
to
all
the
other
hens
in
the
barnyard
that
this
guy
was
falling
in,
the
end
of
the
world
had
come.
if
i
might
say
to
you
in
our
opinion
all
trees
do
not
have
acorns
and
