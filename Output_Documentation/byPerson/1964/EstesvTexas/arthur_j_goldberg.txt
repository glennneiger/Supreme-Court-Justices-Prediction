justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
cofer
can
i
--
would
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
i'm
trying
to
get
the
sequence
of
this
in
mind.
am
i
correct
that
the
case
was
called
for
trial
on
september
24,
1962?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
prior
to
calling
the
case
for
trial,
the
defendant
through
his
lawyers,
presented
the
motion
that
telecasting
and
broadcasting
by
radio
and
photographing
the
trial
be
not
permitted?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
then
there
was
a
two-day
period?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
those
are
the
two
days
you're
now
referring
to
which
were
telecast
and
broadcast
and
there
was
present
a
venire
there
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
-â€“
which
however
was
never
utilized
because
the
defense
asked
for
a
continuance.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
because
of
the
absence
of
certain
witnesses?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
the
case
after
the
two
days,
the
case
was
reset
for
trial
for
october
22nd.
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
what
you
have
now
described
is
the
two
days
that
took
place
where
motions
were
being
argued
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
that
was
all
televised
and
broadcast,
the
arguments
of
counsel,
whatever
took
place.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
now
would
you
be
able
to
tell
us
the
sequence
then
what
happened
in
october
when
the
case
was
then
called
for
trial?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
cofer,
i
think
we're
getting
all
of
this
confused
about
the
facts
here.
there's
a
bill
of
exceptions
in
the
record
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
which
was
induced
in
writing
by
you.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
counsel
for
the
defendant.
it
appears
at
page
18,
19,
20
and
21.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
now
is
this
correct?
this
bill
of
exception
says
the
following
and
i'll
try
to
summarize
it
and
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
that
live
telecasting
and
radio
broadcasting
were
not
permitted
except
for
the
argument
of
the
state
counsel.
you
objected
to
your
argument
being
broadcast
so
that
was
not
--
and
except
for
the
return
of
the
verdict,
that
pictures
were
taken
from
the
booth
of
the
whole
trial.
that
at
the
news
releases
of
the
evenings
of
the
trial,
not
the
whole
trial,
but
pictures
were
shown
without
sound
of
witnesses
testifying.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
that
photographs
were
permitted
providing
that
they
could
be
done
without
bonds.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
this
does
not
indicate,
this
bill
of
exceptions,
that
at
any
time
during
the
trial,
any
sound
by
radio
or
television,
any
sound
as
distinguished
from
pictures,
any
sound
by
radio
or
television
of
the
trial
went
on
the
air.
there
were
however
interviews
by
radio
in
a
room
off
the
courtroom
which
were
used.
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
have
i
summarized
fairly
what
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
that
appears
in
the
record
and
that
is
certified
to
as
an
accurate
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
your
argument
--
you
do
simply
do
this
mr.
cofer
if
i
understand
it
that
your
client
did
not
get
any
trial,
he
was
put
on
a
show.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
which
is
quite
different
from
newspapers.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
that
it?
for
entertainment
or
a
performance
but
not
in
the
trial?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
regular
pictures
--
picture
film
or
this
was
on
video?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
video?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
jaworski.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
regarded
to
me
the
fair
trial
guaranteed
by
our
constitution,
the
defendants
were
put
as
they
have
been
in
cuba
in
a
public
stadium
and
drive
the
court
crowd
of
20,000
people?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
now,
what
is
the
difference
then
between
putting
them
before
a
television
camera
taking
the
last
example
put
by
my
brother
white
and
having
the
trial
in
front
of
several
hundred
thousand
people?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
it
isn't
the
essence
of
the
fair
trial
regardless
about
the
dimensions
of
the
courtroom,
a
trial
before
a
judge
in
a
courtroom?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
court
--
this
court
had
said.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
it
seems
quite
recently.
i
would
like
to
ask
this.
why
television
is
a
public
media
of
communication
you've
argued
in
your
brief,
why
isn't
every
purpose
of
publicity
and
public
access
to
what
goes
on
in
the
courtroom
serve
or
the
television
medium
as
well
as
any
other
by
allowing
the
television
reporters
to
cover
a
court
trial,
by
being
there,
and
then
reporting
on
it
as
newspaper
do?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
cofer
may
i
ask
you
this.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
does
your
argument
come
down
to
this
that
in
the
light
of
human
experience
in
the
a
fair
trial
which
must
be
a
public
trial
in
general
and
take
place
in
the
newspaperman
and
similar
reporting
goes
on
because
this
is
something
that
human
might
have
get
an
experience
witnessing
jurors,
participants
in
the
trial
are
accustomed
to.
but
that
when
the
additional
element
is
added
of
a
camera
focused
interview
and
a
recording
in
either
view
for
use
of
live
or
news
broadcast
and
if
that
additional
element
still
runs
contrary
to
the
concept
of
human
behavior
that
it
is
bound
to
influence
witnesses,
jurors,
adversely
to
a
fair
determination
of
the
case.
