mr.
leon
jaworski
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
in
this
case
at
the
request
of
and
by
appointment
of
the
attorney
general
of
texas.
in
so
doing,
i
am
advocating
a
position
in
this
case
which
is
in
considerable
conflict
with
that
supported
by
the
brethren
of
mine
with
whom
i
have
labored
in
the
vineyard
of
the
american
bar
association.
the
court
is
aware
of
course
of
the
filing
of
an
amicus
curiae
brief
by
the
american
bar
in
this
case
and
also
the
acknowledgment
that
petitioner
has
made
in
his
brief
of
the
assistance
that
was
rendered
by
members
interested
in
canon
35
in
the
preparation
of
petitioner's
brief.
i
do
not
for
a
moment
question
the
earnestness
of
purpose
or
the
sincerity
of
those
very
fine
and
eminent
counsels
who
are
contending
in
their
brief
as
they
are
that
canon
35
should
be
accepted
as
a
constitutional
standard,
but
i
do
feel
that
the
advocating
of
this
principle
has
with
it
much
danger
and
i
think
that
it
is
unsound.
now
because
when
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
granted,
it
was
granted
on
a
point
that
has
canon
35
enmeshed
in
it
being
set
in
the
point
that
canon
35
should
be
adopted
and
accepted
as
a
rule
of
trial
procedure
and
that
unless
it
is
so
done,
there
is
denial
due
process
of
law
i
would
like
to
review
with
the
court
very
briefly
the
history
of
canon
35.
i
think
when
we
bear
this
history
in
mind
we
see
that
actually
what
it
is,
no
more
than
the
statement
of
ethical
standards
of
conduct,
merely
a
statement
of
the
exemplary
conduct
should
be
followed
by
courts.
but
i
think
it's
of
particular
significance
that
the
very
--
on
the
very
last
occasion
that
the
american
bar
association
dealt
with
canon
35
at
a
time
when
it
had
its
midwinter
meeting
in
1963.
at
that
time,
it
very
definitely
announced
its
appraisal
of
canon
35,
an
appraisal
and
a
standing
that
we're
willing
to
adopt.
it
is
our
view
that
at
that
time,
this
canon
was
correctly
elevated
to
the
place
where
it
belonged
so
far
as
it
being
a
standard
of
conduct
is
concerned
but
we
feel
that
the
position
now
taken
which
is
far
different
from
that,
that
it
becomes
a
constitutional
standard
of
conduct
is
a
mistake.
now
may
i
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
wording
of
the
resolution
of
the
american
bar
association
passed
in
1963,
the
last
time
that
this
association
dealt
for
this
canon.
mr.
leon
jaworski
it
is
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
it
is
in
the
brief
sir.
it's
at
the
beginning.
yes
sir,
it's
on
page
5
under
summary
of
argument.
the
canons
of
professional
ethics
and
the
canons
of
judicial
ethics
as
adopted
by
the
american
bar
association,
constitute
the
standards
of
policy
recommended
by
the
american
bar
association
for
the
consideration
and
voluntary
guidance
of
the
rule
making
authorities
of
the
states
of
united
states
and
have
a
force
of
law
only
where
voluntarily
adopted
and
incorporated
in
state
laws
or
as
a
rule
of
court.
we
recommend
that
the
rule-making
authority
of
each
state
exercise
the
exclusive
responsibility
of
adopting
canons
of
ethics
in
the
interest
of
statewide
uniformity
and
avoidance
of
confusion
and
pressures
that
have
resulted
in
some
jurisdictions
where
magistrates
or
judges
have
individually
adopted
rules
concerning
the
conduct
of
their
courts.
now
this
was
a
recommendation
made
by
the
committee
that
have
been
studying
this
matter
and
this
recommendation
was
adopted
by
the
house
of
delegates
and
following
the
adoption
of
this
resolution,
the
committee
that
had
been
dealing
with
canon
35
was
discharged
and
this
is
the
last
time
that
the
american
bar
association
officially
dealt
with
this
canon.
i
would
like
to
briefly
comment
on
the
history
of
canon
35
even
before
this
last
action
occurred
because
i
think
it's
very
significant
in
showing
what
its
true
purpose
was.
the
very
first
of
the
canon's
of
judicial
ethics
were
adopted
in
1924.
at
that
time,
there
was
no
canon
35,
there
were
34
canons
at
that
time.
in
1937,
canon
35
was
adopted
for
the
first
time
it
read
differently
at
that
time
than
it
does
now.
it
placed
its
emphasis
upon
matters
that
are
far
different
from
what
is
argued
now.
it
placed
its
emphasis
upon
the
dignity
and
the
decorum
in
the
courtroom.
it
placed
emphasis
upon
the
fact
that
photography
and
broadcasting
and
that's
all
it
referred
to
at
that
time
were
degrading
to
the
court,
and
that
it
placed
its
emphasis
upon
the
statement
that
photography
and
broadcasting
should
not
be
permitted
because
of
the
misconceptions
that
might
be
left
for
the
public.
now
the
canon
was
then
amended
in
1952,
and
at
that
time,
again
there
were
these
things
stressed
by
the
canon.
first,
dignity
and
decorum,
again
degrading
of
the
court,
creating
misconceptions
in
the
minds
of
the
public,
but
for
the
first
time
that
was
included
televising
and
it
was
then
said
that
these
elements,
these
factors,
the
televising,
photography
and
broadcasting
are
calculated
to
detract
the
witness
in
giving
his
testimony.
the
last
amendment
to
canon
35
was
made
at
this
time
that
i
have
mentioned
to
the
court
a
few
minutes
ago,
in
1963.
it
was
made
after
this
case
was
tried
in
the
trial
court.
and
at
that
time,
we
find
that
the
part
of
canon
35,
that
related
to
the
degrading
of
the
court
had
been
dropped
and
so
after
these
many
years
of
experience,
after
this
many
years
of
insisting
that
photographing
and
broadcasting
were
degrading
to
the
court,
the
american
bar
association
changed
its
mind
and
dropped
that
from
the
canon,
but
in
order
to
under
guard
it
and
because
there
was
included
a
change
an
amendment,
a
further
amendment
which
said
that
instead
of
calculated
to
distract
the
witness
that
it
is
calculated
to
distract
that
it
is
--
that
it
does
distract
witnesses,
distract
witnesses
and
participants
but
that
was
the
last
change
that
was
made.
now
again,
if
we
go
back
to
the
preamble
about
canons
of
ethics
as
to
what
the
entire
purpose
was,
we
see
that
the
preamble
states
too
in
matter
entirely
consistent
with
what
was
said
by
the
american
bar
association
as
late
as
1963.
we
find
that
it
says
that
the
association
adopts
the
following
canons,
the
spirit
of
which
it
suggests
as
a
proper
guide
and
reminder
for
judges
and
is
indicating
what
the
people
have
a
right
to
expect
from
them.
now
there
are
a
number
of
canons.
canon
35
is
before
the
court
but
why
should
canon
35
be
singled
out
as
one
that
sets
forth
constitutional
standards
and
none
of
the
other
canons.
we
have
situations
where
there
can
be
an
abuse
of
canon
35
that
obviously
affect
in
our
thinking
the
constitutional
rights
of
a
defendant,
but
that
can
be
true
with
respect
to
spectators.
it
can
be
true
with
respect
to
the
press,
it
can
be
true
with
respect
to
television.
other
canons
are
in
exactly
the
same
situation
and
if
a
canon
5
for
instance
which
deals
with
impatience
and
intemperateness
on
the
part
of
the
court.
now
that
could
seriously
affect
the
fairness
of
the
accused
trial,
but
doesn't
necessarily
do
so
simply
because
a
judge
has
made
some
intemperate
remarks
or
has
shown
some
impatience.
does
it
per
se
mean
that
because
that
canon
has
been
violated
that
there
has
been
a
denial
of
due
process.
mr.
leon
jaworski
we
fully
agree
with.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that's
the
point
i'm
making
exactly.
the
question
of
whether
there
has
been
any
unfairness
here
is
something
that
has
to
be
looked
at
on
a
basis
of
its
own
factual
situation
and
my
comments
to
the
court
are
being
made
simply
in
response
to
what
the
petitioner
has
been
arguing
when
he
says,
the
mere
fact
that
there
has
been
a
television
camera
in
the
courtroom
and
that's
what
it
amounts
to
that
there
has
been
prejudice.
and
in
making
that
sort
of
a
contention
what
is
actually
happening
here
is
that
the
principles
that
this
court
has
announced
on
a
number
of
occasions
are
being
swept
aside
because
so
far
as
i
know,
i
haven't
found
a
single
case
where
this
court
has
ever
said
that
it
is
going
to
be
presumed
that
there
was
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law,
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
presumption
that
the
defendant
has
been
denied
a
fair
trial.
i
know
that
this
court
has
said
just
the
contrary
in
a
number
of
cases.
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
leon
jaworski
well
i'm
familiar
with
that
case.
i
don't
think
that
if
it
says
that
the
court
is
going
to
presume
that
there
has
been
unfairness,
there
had
to
be
a
showing
in
the
record
that
there
was
some
prejudice,
that
there
were
some
unfairness
and
this
court
for
instance
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
well
i
do
remember
that.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that's
correct
sir
but
you
had
in
a
record,
they're
a
state
of
facts
from
which
it
appears
that
there
had
been
an
unfairness.
point
that
i'm
making
is
that
if
you
have
simply
a
position
where
it
is
said
that
there
has
been
here
some
prejudice
simply
because
of
television
camera
was
introduced
in
the
courtroom
then
you're
going
to
have
to
say
precisely
the
same
thing
simply
because
a
television
camera
was
in
there
for
a
short
period
of
time
taking
perhaps
no
more
than
the
oaths
that
were
administered
to
the
jurors
where
will
a
line
be
drawn.
mr.
leon
jaworski
as
far
--
yes
sir.
i
would
be
making
precisely
the
same
argument
so
long
as
there
was
some
showing
that
there
was
some
unfairness
that
resulted
or
some
prejudice
that
resulted
as
a
result
of
that.
mr.
leon
jaworski
you
certainly
could.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
certainly
would
not
mr.
justice
goldberg
but
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
because
one
was
under
the
control
of
the
court,
and
one
was
under
the
supervision
of
the
court
and
the
other
one
is
not.
precisely
the
same
argument
that
i'm
making
here
i
think
would
apply
if
you
have
a
tremendously
large
courtroom,
there's
no
regulation
as
to
what
the
size
of
the
courtroom
maybe
so
long
as
the
court
can
supervise
and
can
properly
control
the
conduct
of
what
goes
on.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that's
correct,
correct.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that's
one
way
of
doing
it,
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow
that
because
it's
done
by
the
broadcasting
of
pictures
from
the
courtroom
that
there
has
been
an
unfair
trial.
again,
the
trial
itself
is
a
public
event
and
the
court
has
said
so.
the
court
has
said
that
what
transpires
in
the
courtroom
is
public
property.
now
the
only
question
is,
one
of
degree
and
the
question
then
comes
of
whether
or
not
there
has
something
happened
in
that
courtroom
and
has
denied
the
defendant
a
fair
trial.
now
that
could
occasion
just
as
well
and
come
about
just
as
well
by
virtue
of
the
spectators
that
are
in
the
courtroom.
it
can
–
could
come
about
just
as
well
by
virtue
of
the
number
of
newspaper
men
that
are
in
a
courtroom.
it
could
also
come
about
by
virtue
of
broadcasting
and
televising,
but
the
mere
fact
that
there
is
broad
what
transpires
in
the
courtroom
to
a
thousand
people
let's
say
instead
of
50
people
or
50,000
instead
of
a
thousand,
why
should
that
as
long
as
it
is
fairly
portrayed
mean
that
the
defendant
has
been
denied
a
fair
trial.
mr.
leon
jaworski
the
jury
had
not
been
sequestered,
you
would
again
have
a
problem
that
we
don't
have
here.
the
problem
there
would
have
been
mr.
justice
brennan
whether
any
of
that
information
would
have
reached
the
jury.
i
do
think
you'd
have
a
different
problem,
yes.
but
as
it
was
pointed
out
to
the
chief
justice,
in
answer
to
mr.
chief
justice
warren's
question,
there
actually
was
a
complete
segregation
of
this
jury
from
all
outside
like
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
think
that's
right.
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
follow
everything
mr.
chief
justice
that
you
say
except
the
conclusion
that
is
implied
in
your
question
and
if
there
is
any
unfairness
of
the
trial
per
se
by
virtue
of
that.
it
could
result
to
the
unfairness,
but
it
perhaps
might
not.
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
it
is
true
and
may
i
illustrate
it.
for
instance,
suppose
we
have
20
members
of
the
press
who
are
there
by
permission
of
the
court
and
you
also
have
at
present
a
number
of
spectators,
in
fact
the
courtroom
for
the
spectators.
you
have
one
television
camera
that's
obscured
that
takes
only
a
few
of
the
proceedings
for
instance
the
swearing
in
of
witness
or
such
as
that.
now,
let's
remove
the
20
members
of
the
press
and
let's
remove
the
spectators,
but
you
still
have
that
television
camera
the
mere
fact
that
the
television
camera
is
there,
are
we
going
to
conclude
from
that
that
there
has
been
an
unfairness
in
the
trial?
now
all
of
these
things
were
permitted
by
the
court.
you
have
less
disorder
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
can't
see
the
difference
mr.
chief
justice
as
far
as
the
question
of
due
process,
denial
of
due
process
is
concerned.
i
can
certainly
see
the
difference
from
the
standpoint
of
what
might
be
called
a
dignified
proceeding.
i
can
see
there
is
difference
from
what
might
be
said
to
be
the
course
because
i
can
well
see
where
a
lot
of
confusion
could
result
from
it.
i
cannot
see
the
difference
when
it
gets
down
to
applying
the
test
that
this
court
has
applied
in
several
cases
on
the
question
of
what
constitutes
a
denial
of
due
process
alone.
if
we
were
to
reach
a
conclusion,
otherwise,
we
would
have
to
say
that
there
is
no
burden
at
all
on
the
defendant
any
longer
to
show
any
kind
of
an
invasion
of,
to
hear
the
fairness
of
his
trial
but
all
he
have
to
do
is
come
in
and
say,
well
there
has
been
a
picture
taken
here.
there's
been
some
televising
and
that
ends
it.
i'm
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
now
that
would
be
a
very
extreme
rule.
it
would
be
a
rule
far
different
from
any
that
this
court
has
ever
announced
before
and
i
think
it's
contrary
to
rules
that
the
court
has
announced.
mr.
leon
jaworski
it
may
not
be
an
absurd
rule
your
honor
but
it
would
certainly
be
an
invasion
of
what
the
right
--
what
the
state
has
the
right
to
do.
this
court
has
said
a
number.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that's
correct
sir.
we
don't
know
whether
the
reason
for
it
was
that
there
was
any
feeling
on
anyone's
part
that
it
necessarily
denied
somebody
a
right
of
a
fair
trial
though
to
have
it.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes,
all
except
texas
and
colorado
have
adopted.
we're
not
talking
about
the
federal
rule
now,
we're
talking
about
a
rule
that
the
states
have
voluntarily
adopted,
but
the
american
bar
again
although
it's
meshed
in
this
thing
and
we
can't
get
away
from
it.
it
has
always
said
that
there
should
be
something
for
the
voluntary
guidance
of
the
states
themselves
and
it
certainly
should
not
be
considered
as
affecting
the
question
of
due
process
or
the
question
of
fairness
of
trial
and
if
it
had
ever
been
found
that
that
was
so,
we
can
be
certain
it
would
have
been
placed
in
canon
35
but
there
is
not
the
slightest
reference
to
that
effect.
mr.
leon
jaworski
oh
and
they've
not.
i'm
not
saying
that
mr.
justice
white.
i
am
pointing
out
though
that
we
don't
need
to
conclude
and
i
think
it
would
be
erroneous
for
us
to
conclude
that
the
reason
for
that
is
based
upon
any
denial
of
constitutional
rights.
they
had
--
they
may
have
had
other
reasons
for
doing
it.
it
may
relate
to
the
dignity
to
the
coarseness
in
the
courtroom
and
certainly
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
alright.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes.
mr.
leon
jaworski
no.
i'm
not
because
i
don't
think
mr.
justice
stewart
that
that
is
the
test
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
it's
a
matter
of
that
is
before
the
court.
i
may
have
my
brothers
if
i
may
answer
a
question
just
a
little
further
and
i
would
because
certain
things
are
annoyances
to
me,
i
would
prefer
that
for
instance
there
would
be
fewer
spectators
who
would
trouble
me
particularly
when
i'm
representing
an
unpopular
litigant
or
an
unpopular
cause.
there
are
glares
and
their
stares
and
their
comments
and
so
on.
i'd
like
to
get
rid
of
them
but
i
would
be
spawning
a
greater
evil
than
the
matter
of
getting
rid
of
them
because
what
i
would
be
doing
is
bringing
about
opportunities
for
oppression.
mr.
leon
jaworski
mr.
justice
brennan
that's
another
constitutional
amendment.
that's
what
it
amounts
to
in
my
--
into
my
books.
it
elevates
you
to
the
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
it
elevates
into
that
statute.
i
thank
the
court.
