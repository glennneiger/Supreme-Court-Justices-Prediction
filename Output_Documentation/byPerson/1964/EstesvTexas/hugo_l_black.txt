justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
given
a
description
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
who?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
now
that
is
all
televisions
would
be
held
unconstitutional
to
have
television
in
any
court
is
that
what
you're
saying
--
telling
me?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand
the
length
of
your
argument.
are
you
arguing
that
if
we
would
have
television
in
this
court
or
that
have
television
in
any
other
courts
that
it's
unconstitutional,
the
constitution
forbids
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
going
that
far
that's
what
i
meant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
were
saying
and
the
defendant
has
a
right
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
object
and
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
permit
television
over
his
objection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
your
point.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
record
does
not
show
that
any
part
of
it
was
broadcast
so
that
the
public
could
hear
and
see
it
during
the
time
of
the
trial.
is
that
right?
