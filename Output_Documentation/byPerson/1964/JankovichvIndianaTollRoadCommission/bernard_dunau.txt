mr.
bernard
dunau
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
questions
in
this
case.
first,
is
a
zoning
ordinance
which
restricts
the
height
of
structures
on
land
surrounding
an
airport
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
safe
and
unobstructed
aerial
approaches,
a
taking
of
property
which
requires
compensation
and
is
therefore
invalid.
second
--
the
federal
aviation
agency.
that's
precisely
what
they
call
them
in
there
too.
the
second
question
is
whether
an
independent
and
adequate
state
ground
exists
which
precludes
this
court
from
deciding
whether
airport
zoning
is
a
constitutional
exercise
of
governmental
power.
now
this
is
what
happened.
in
1939,
the
city
of
gary
enacted
an
ordinance
which
declared
that
it
needs
shall
acquire
and
operate
an
airport.
in
1947,
they
got
the
land
for
the
operation
of
this
airport.
they
got
it
from
the
united
states.
the
grant
from
the
united
states
read
that
the
land
was
given
for
an
inconsideration
of
the
development
and
operation
of
the
demised
premises
as
a
public
airport
in
perpetuity
and
for
the
benefit
which
shall
accrue
to
the
united
states
from
the
continued
use
of
such
property
as
of
airport.
there
was
to
be
automatic
reversion
of
the
title
to
the
land
to
the
united
states
if
and
in
the
event
that
the
administrator
of
civil
aeronautics
or
his
successors
determine
that
the
premises
have
not
been
developed
for
airport
purposes
within
a
reasonable
time
or
that
after
having
been
so
developed,
they
seize
to
be
used
for
airport
purposes.
gary
promised
that
the
airport
will
be
operated
as
a
public
airport
on
fair
and
reasonable
terms
and
without
unjust
discrimination.
in
1948,
one
year
later,
gary
adapted
a
master
airport
plan.
a
plan
called
for
the
construction
of
three
runways,
an
east-west
runway
which
has
not
been
constructed.
a
northwest-southeast
runway
which
has
been
constructed
but
is
not
involved
in
this
proceeding
and
a
north-south
runway
which
has
been
constructed
and
is
the
runway,
we
are
particularly
concerned
with.
in
the
construction
of
this
airport,
federal
funds
were
used
as
well
as
municipal
funds.
the
federal
funds
were
obtained
as
a
result
of
a
grant
agreement
between
the
civil
aeronautics
administration,
the
predecessor
of
the
f.a.a.
and
gary,
under
the
federal
airport
act.
now,
in
september
of
'49,
about
the
time
that
airport
construction
was
to
begin,
the
city
of
gary
enacted
an
airport
zoning
ordinance.
this
airport
zoning
ordinance
which
appears
on
the
record
of
page
151,
divided
the
land
on
which
the
airport
was
located
as
well
as
all
surrounding
land
within
a
distance
of
two
miles
from
the
proposed
end
of
the
runway
into
four
zones.
the
zones
were
a
turning
zone,
an
outer
area
approach
zone,
an
inner
area
approach
zone
and
a
transition
zone.
in
the
turning
zone,
the
height
limitation
was
150
feet.
the
same
height
limitation
pertained
in
the
outer
area
approach
zone.
a
particular
zone
we
are
concerned
with
is
the
inner
area
approach
zone
and
the
ordinance
read
this
way,
inner
area
approach
zone
as
indicated
extending
6,000
feet
from
the
end
of
the
proposed
runway
not
to
exceed
height
greater
than
permitted
of
40-to-1
slope.
now,
a
40-to-1
slope
means
that
for
every
40
feet
that
you
go
out
horizontally,
you
go
out
one
--
you
go
out
one
foot
vertically.
if
this
is
your
end
of
your
proposed
runway,
you
go
40
feet
this
way,
you
then
go
one
foot
of
that
way.
your
glide
angle
is
this
line
between
the
zero
point
and
the
one
foot
point.
now
this
glide
angle
continues
out
on
the
same
line
until
it
reaches
100
of
the
6,000
foot
mark,
of
that
point,
you
have
150
feet
here
and
your
glide
angle
on
your
inner
area
approach
zone
is
this
line
in
here.
if
you
went
out
another
40
feet,
you
get
two
feet
elevation,
another
40
feet
you
get
three
feet
and
so
on
until
you
run
the
6,000
feet
at
which
point
you
reach
150
feet
elevation
which
is
the
same
elevation
as
the
turning
zone
and
the
outer
area
approach
zone.
there
is
finally
a
transition
zone
with
a
height
limit
based
on
a
7:1
slope
which
means
for
seven
horizontal
feet,
you
go
up
one
foot
vertically
from
the
edge
of
the
inner
area
approach
zone
to
a
maximum
height
of
150
feet.
now,
perhaps
a
rough
diagram
will
explain
this
a
little
bit
better.
you
have
your
runway
here.
this
is
your
north-south
runway.
at
this
point
here,
this
is
the
end
of
the
proposed
runway,
you
go
out
two
miles.
then
you
make
a
circle
with
the
two
miles
and
this
entire
circle
which
goes
around
the
airport
and
the
land
surrounding
it
is
your
turning
zone.
the
height
limitation
throughout
this
entire
zone
is
150
feet.
now,
at
the
end
of
the
proposed
runway,
you
go
500
feet
this
way.
at
the
end
of
the
two
miles,
you
go
2,500
feet
this
way.
this
is
your
approached
surface.
it
flares
out
from
500
feet
here
to
2,500
feet
there.
now
along
this
two-mile
line,
you
have
the
6,000
feet
that
goes
up
for
your
40-to-1
glide
slope.
this
portion
in
here
is
your
inner
area
approach
zone.
this
portion
here
is
your
outer
area
approach
zone.
your
height
limit
here
is
150
feet
as
it
is
throughout
the
rest
of
the
turning
zone.
within
this
area
here,
your
height
limit
runs
from
zero
at
the
end
of
the
proposed
runway
to
150
feet
depending
where
along
the
6,000
feet
you
area.
there
is
finally
this
transition
zone.
this
is
a
zone
which
is
something
like
that,
declared
as
a
7:1
off
the
edge
of
the
approached
area
and
it
stops
at
the
point
that
you
reach
150
feet
so
that
you
have
a
truck
in
here.
the
truck
is
made
up
of
your
40-to-1
right
angle
and
your
transition
zone
at
the
side
of
it
and
this
is
your
area
approach
zone,
the
plane
comes
in
for
landing
circles
on
the
turning
zone
and
from
within
--
going
out
of
this
way.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
transition
zone
is
what
its
name
says.
it's
a
transition
from
the
area
approach
zone
to
the
turning
zone.
it's
the
area
which
tells
you
from
your
lower
height
limitation
here
to
your
150
feet
here.
i'll
try
to
explain
this
a
little
more
later,
but
on
this
astray,
your
transition
zone
is
the
line,
the
7-to-1
glide
slope
which
indents
from
the
area
approach
zone.
mr.
bernard
dunau
some
portion
of
the
area
approach
zone
and
transition
zone
start
with
zero.
now,
in
this
case,
i
get
a
little
ahead
of
it.
the
boundary
of
a
grand
calumet
--
the
boundary
of
the
southern
part
of
the
airport
is
the
grand
calumet
river.
at
the
point
that
this
ordinance
begins
to
pinch
a
property
owner,
it
is
on
this
side
of
the
grand
calumet
river.
on
this
side
of
the
grand
calumet
river,
before
the
petitioners
move
the
river
175
feet,
the
maximum
height
limitation
was
22
and
one
half
feet.
so
at
the
point
that
this
ordinance
begins
to
pinch,
you
can
build
structures
up
to
22
and
one
half
feet
but
not
in
excess
of
22
and
a
half
feet.
mr.
bernard
dunau
of
the
river?
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
am
--
this
is
something
the
record
does
not
disclose.
i
am
starting
at
the
farthest
side
of
the
river
on
the
assumption
that
the
river
edge
on
this
side
is
the
boundary
line.
if
the
river
end
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
separating
the
airport
property.
in
other
words
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
this
is
the
airport
property.
mr.
bernard
dunau
this
is
the
other
property
on
the
other
side,
the
river
separated
and
i'm
assuming
that
the
people
who
do
this
ordinance
said
there
wasn't
going
to
be
anybody
building
structures
on
the
riverbed.
so
the
point
that
it
began
to
pinch
--
adjacent
property
on
this
would
be
on
this
side
of
the
riverbed.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
22
and
one
half
feet,
right.
now,
the
ordinance
provided
that
with
respect
to
any
existing
structures
at
the
time
it
was
enacted,
and
with
respect
to
any
structures
which
could
be
completed
within
two
years
of
the
enactment
of
the
ordinance,
the
zoning
ordinance
was
to
have
no
effect.
if
such
structures
were
in
excess
of
the
height
limitations,
these
were
non-conforming
uses
and
they
would
have
to
be
tolerated.
with
respect
to
all
other
structures,
they
would
be
to
comply
with
the
height
limitations
except
that
this
ordinance
also
provided
for
a
variance.
if
the
adjacent
property
owner
could
show
particular
hardship
and
that
his
building
of
a
structure
in
excess
of
the
height
limit
could
be
accommodated
in
keeping
with
the
spirit
and
the
purpose
of
the
ordinance,
a
variance
would
be
granted
and
this
was
the
essential
scheme
of
the
ordinance.
now
the
reason
for
the
ordinance
as
recited
in
the
preamble
is
this;
airport
hazards
endanger
the
lives
and
property
of
the
uses
of
the
gary
municipal
airport
and
the
occupants
of
the
land
in
its
vicinity
and
in
effect,
the
airport
hazard,
reduces
the
size
of
the
area
available
for
landing,
taking
off
and
maneuvering
of
aircraft
thus
tending
to
destroy
or
impair
the
utility
of
the
airport
and
the
public
investments
in
it.
the
preamble
went
on
to
overcome
these
hazards.
the
board
of
aviation
commissioners
of
gary
adapted
certain
standards
for
the
safe
decent,
landing
and
decent
of
aircraft
for
the
proper
and
safe
use
of
the
airport
and
landing
fields
in
respect
to
height
and
location
of
structures
and
use
of
land.
and
finally,
the
order
that
the
preamble
stated
that
the
enactment
of
the
ordinance
was
necessary
in
the
interest
of
public
health,
public
safety
and
general
welfare
to
the
end
that
creation
or
establishment
of
airport
hazards
be
prevented
to
the
extent
possible
by
exercise
of
the
police
power.
one
year
later,
in
1950,
the
lessees
here,
the
petitioners
entered
into
a
lease
agreement
with
gary
through
the
board
of
aviation
commissioners
to
operate
this
airport
for
20
years
with
an
option
to
renew
for
another
20
years
and
they
invested
about
$400,000
to
create
the
facilities
necessary
for
the
operation
of
an
airport.
and
this
was
the
situation
which
prevailed
until
1954
or
1955,
some
four
or
five
years
later
when
the
respondent,
the
indiana
toll
road
commission
came
on
to
see.
the
respondent
acquired
a
right
of
way
during
1954
and
1955
for
the
construction
of
a
toll
road.
the
part
of
the
toll
road
we
are
concerned
with
runs
in
an
east-west
direction
along
the
south
boundary
of
the
airport
process.
it
was
a
plot
with
a
modification
under
the
present
--
toll
road
obstructs
the
property
of
the
airport.
now,
instead
of
building
this
toll
road
on
this
side
of
the
river
edge,
the
people
building
the
toll
road
in
fact
moved
the
riverbed
over
by
175
feet,
the
width
of
the
river,
built
that
toll
road
on
the
riverbed
and
moved
the
river
on
to
the
airport
property.
they
not
only
moved
the
river
on
to
the
airport
property
and
built
their
toll
road
on
the
riverbed.
they
elevated
the
toll
road
30
feet
above
the
ground
level
of
the
riverbed.
the
consequence
was
that
at
the
point
that
they
built
their
toll
road;
the
height
limitation
was
a
little
more
than
18
feet.
they
went
up
30
feet.
they
penetrated
the
protected
airspace
by
12
feet.
had
they
stayed
on
this
side
of
the
riverbed
they
still
would
have
penetrated
the
airspace
but
by
less.
on
this
side
of
the
riverbed
had
they
gone
up
30
feet,
they
would
have
penetrated
the
airspace
by
8
and
one
half.
the
practical
consequence
of
penetrating
the
airspace
is
that
before
they
violated
the
ordinance,
you
could
fly
plane
on
to
this
runway
which
were
heavier
than
15,000
pounds.
after
you
put
this
toll
road
up
there,
you
could
no
longer
fly
plane
safely
weighing
more
than
15,000
pounds
on
to
this
runway,
the
consequences
obviously,
loss
of
business.
as
a
result,
the
lessees
having
been
injured,
damaged
in
their
business,
wrote
a
suit
for
injunctive
relief
and
for
damages
based
upon
the
violation
of
the
ordinance.
now,
the
particular
issue
which
we
are
concerned
with
today,
first
was
raised
in
the
trial
court
in
the
course
of
trying
this
case
when
the
petitioners
moved
or
offered
the
ordinance
into
evidence.
at
this
point,
when
the
petitioners
offered
the
ordinance
into
evidence,
the
respondents
objected
to
its
admission,
stating
that
the
ordinance
was
a
legal
note.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
quote
at
this
point
precisely
what
they
stated
because
this
is
the
only
contention
that
was
ever
raised
either
at
the
trial
court,
or
in
the
court
below
in
the
indiana
supreme
court.
this
is
the
only
question
which
is
here
today.
this
is
what
they
stated
in
objecting
to
the
offer
of
the
ordinance
into
evidence.
the
attempt
to
establish
glide
angles
or
slopes
in
controlling
the
height
of
structures
and
objects
near
an
airport
by
zoning,
is
the
unconstitutional
taking
of
property
without
payment
of
compensation
and
is
offensive
to
and
violative
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
and
article
1,
section
21
of
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
indiana.
the
enactment
of
the
purported
airport
zoning
ordinance
is
an
unlawful
and
unreasonable
exercise
of
police
powers
by
the
city
of
gary,
in
attempting
through
zoning,
to
do
that
which
must
be
done
under
the
city's
right
of
eminent
domain.
the
objection
was
overruled.
the
ordinance
was
received
into
evidence.
at
the
end
of
plaintiff's
case,
the
defendant
respondent
here,
move
for
a
finding
in
its
favor
and
as
read
by
the
court
below,
the
finding
that
it
wanted
in
its
favor
was
based
on
the
same
contention
that
it
had
made
in
objecting
to
the
admission
of
the
ordinance
into
evidence.
after
trial,
the
judgment
for
a
$164,000
was
rendered
in
favor
of
the
lessees
in
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
in
hike
verb-ah,
the
identical
objection
to
the
judgment
was
repeated
as
had
been
made
to
the
ordinance
--
to
the
admission
of
the
ordinance
in
evidence.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir
but
more
particularly
or
another
reason
that
i
want
to
stress
is,
is
that
the
only
on
the
merits,
the
only
question
before
this
court
is
the
validity
of
this
ordinance
on
its
face
and
not
as
respondent
would
try
to
change
this
case
in
this
court
into
a
question
whether
it
was
invalid
by
virtue
of
its
specific
application
in
the
particular
circumstances
of
this
case.
that
has
never
been
an
issue.
it
has
been
injected
into
the
case
for
the
first
time
here.
now,
when
they
got
to
the
court
below,
to
the
indian
supreme
court,
they
again
restricted
their
attack
to
the
same
identical
abstract
attack
on
the
face
of
the
ordinance.
and
they
introduced
their
argument
in
the
brief
below
with
the
statement,
our
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance
is
the
same
one
that
we
voiced
when
we
objected
to
the
admission
of
the
ordinance
into
evidence.
and
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
because
what
was
an
issue
is
whether
the
ordinance
was
violated.
there
was
no
question
about
that
that
was
tried
and
that
was
proved.
and
all
you
have
to
prove
to
prove
that
the
ordinance
is
violated
was
to
show
what
the
height
limitation
was
at
that
point
and
to
show
that
it
has
been
breached.
another
thing
that
was
tried
and
litigated
obviously
was
that
the
breach
caused
damage,
and
so
a
good
part
of
the
record
went
to
showing
anticipated
profits,
and
what
was
a
reasonable
approximation
of
the
loss
and
damages
and
that
is
what
was
litigated.
there
were
others
state
issues
but
they
are
not
material
now.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
was
and
still
is
in
use.
but
the
problem
is
that
at
present
use,
at
least
insofar
as
the
record
shows,
when
i
say
present.
and
that
before
this
toll
road
came
up,
you
could
use
it
for
landing
aircraft
15,000
pounds
or
more
after
the
toll
road
came
up.
you
couldn't
--
this
was
a
diminished
use
of
the
airport,
increased
its
usable
--
usableness
and
the
judgment
reflects
the
damages
as
a
consequence
of
that,
the
objection
which
the
respondents
made
in
the
trial
court
and
on
the
indiana
supreme
court
prevailed
in
the
indiana
supreme
court.
the
indiana
supreme
court
said
that
this
ordinance
is
wholly
void,
invalid
as
in
entirety.
it
cited
this
court's
decisions
in
united
states
v.
causby
and
griggs
v.
allegheny
for
the
conclusion
that
the
reasonable
and
ordinary
use
of
airspace
above
land
is
a
property
right
which
cannot
be
taken
without
the
payment
of
compensation.
it's
cited
this
court's
decisions
in
griggs
and
pennsylvania
coal
company
v.
mahon
for
its
proposition
that
the
taking
or
appropriating
a
private
property
by
the
government
for
a
specific
public
use
can
be
effective
only
if
compensation
is
provided.
it's
cited
this
court's
decision
in
euclid
v.
ambler
for
the
proposition
that
there
was
no
need
to
exhaust
the
administrative
remedies
under
the
ordinance
because
the
ordinance
is
invalid
as
an
entirety,
and
it's
cited
this
court's
decisions
in
muglar
v.
kansas
for
the
proposition
that
it
could
look
through
the
statement
of
policy
in
the
ordinance
and
treat
it
as
an
artifice.
and
so
it
concluded
it,
that
so
long
as
you
were
zoning
property
which
had
a
reasonable
and
ordinary
use,
you
could
not
do
that,
you
had
to
take
it
and
pay
for
it.
and
that
presents
the
question
on
the
merits
which
we
have
to
decide
today.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it's
cited
there
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
don't
know
what
significance
it
is
whether
one
is
cited
first
or
another
second.
i
could
measure
and
show
that
the
quotations
from
griggs
and
causby
are
bigger
than
any
other
part.
mr.
bernard
dunau
if
i
may,
your
honor
i
would
--
i
intend
to
come
back
to
that.
i
think
the
question
of
the
independent
and
adequate
state
remedy
ground
cannot
be
understood
until
we
first
know
what
the
federal
airport
act
is
about,
and
what
airport
zoning
does.
at
that
juncture,
i
think,
i
can
more
intelligently
talk
to
the
court
about
whether
there
is
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground.
so
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
defer
that
question.
the
technical
foundation
for
all
airport
zoning
in
this
country
today
is
technical
standard
order
number
nat,
promulgated
by
the
federal
aviation
agency
which
is
in
our
brief
as
appendix
d
at
page
15a.
this
technical
standard
order
is
called
a
criteria
for
determining
obstructions
to
air
navigation.
it
measures
the
space
around
an
airport
which
is
necessary
for
safe
and
unobstructed
flight.
this
astray
is
the
physical
representation
of
the
obstruction
criteria
as
prepared
by
the
federal
aviation
agency.
this
standard
the
--
have
the
obstruction
criteria
divide
the
land
surrounding
an
airport
at
the
land
on
the
airport
itself
into
four
surfaces.
you
have
first
your
horizontal
surface,
which
is
150
feet
from
the
approximate
center
of
the
airport,
and
the
elevation
of
150
feet
is
measured
from
the
highest
usable
part
of
the
land
area.
this
horizontal
surface
of
150
feet
is
the
same
thing
as
the
turning
zone
in
the
ordinance
we
have.
now,
after
the
ordinance
was
enacted,
the
federal
aviation
agency
had
a
refinement
on
the
standard
that
then
existed,
and
they
added
a
conical
surface
to
this
horizontal
surface.
the
conical
surface
is
at
a
20-to-1
glide
angle
from
the
edge
of
a
horizontal
surface.
now
the
width
of
the
horizontals
--
or
the
distance
from
the
center
to
the
end
of
the
horizontal
surface
and
from
the
end
of
the
horizontal
surface
to
the
end
of
the
conical
surface
is
based
on
the
kind
of
airport
you
have
will
vary
depending
on
what
kind
of
airport
you
were
dealing
with.
i
think
it
varies
from
12,000
feet
for
an
intercontinental
airport
to
something
like
5,000
feet
for
a
secondary
or
personal
airport.
this
is
called
the
pat
of
the
obstruction
criteria.
this
provides
circling
room
for
a
plane
to
maneuver
in
order
to
get
into
a
position
to
land
or
when
it
takes
off
to
get
out.
then
you
have
the
trough,
the
trough
is
the
approach
to
surfaces.
you
have
varying
approach
surfaces.
in
our
case,
we
have
a
40-to-1
glide
slope.
you
can
have
a
20-to-1
glide
slope,
if
you
have
a
very
small
airport.
you
will
have
to
have
a
50-to-1
glide
slope
up
to
a
certain
distance
and
a
40-to-1
glide
slope
for
the
remainder
of
the
distance.
if
you
have
an
airport
which
is
to
take
planes
that
can
land
on
instruments.
again,
at
the
base
of
the
approached
zone,
you
start
with
a
particular
width
depending
on
what
kind
of
a
approach
surface
you're
dealing
with.
it
always
flares
out
to
another
width
at
the
end
of
it.
and
then
you
have
your
transition
zone
which
takes
you
from
your
--
the
edge
of
your
approach
surface,
to
the
height
of
the
adjacent
turning
zone
or
conical
surface
as
the
case
may
be.
you
got
to
have
this
clear
airspace
in
order
to
operate
an
airport
safely.
if
you
have
got
obstructions
intruding
through
here,
you
cannot
fly
an
airplane
safely.
and
you've
got
to
have
it
through
out
here
because
you
never
know
when
engine
will
go
out,
or
when
an
aircraft
will
be
in
trouble
and
it
would
need
more
than
the
minimum
of
that
as
ordinarily
necessary
for
normal
plane.
now
of
three
ways
--
there
are
three
ways
you
can
get
to
this
protection.
you
can
buy
all
the
land.
you
can
buy
some
of
the
land
and
get
easements
on
other
of
it.
you
can
buy
all,
or
you
can
buy
some.
you
can
get
easements
on
some,
and
you
can
zone
for
some.
the
way
it
actually
works
is
you
do
all
three.
you
buy
some,
you
get
easements
for
some
and
you
zone
some.
the
court
below
says,
you
cannot
zone
any
and
that
is
our
question
on
the
merits.
federal
airport
or
airport
zoning,
at
the
heart
of
it,
is
the
federal
airport
act.
the
federal
airport
act
is
designed
to
effectuate
a
national
airport
plan.
and
the
plan
is
to
establish
a
nationwide
system
of
public
airports,
adequate
to
meet
present
and
future
needs
of
civil
aeronautics.
and
the
way,
congress
did
this
was
via
granting
a
program.
it
will
give
money
to
counties
and
municipalities
to
build
airports,
if
those
counties
and
municipalities
will
build
them
in
conformity
with
federal
standards.
you
comply
with
the
federal
standard,
you
get
the
money.
you
are
unwilling
to
comply,
you
do
not
get
the
money.
one
of
the
standards
to
which
the
federal
government
exacts
compliance
in
order
to
give
financial
aid
is
the
elimination
of
safety
hazards.
the
airport
or
the
federal
airport
act
defines
as
an
airport
hazard,
any
structure
or
object
of
natural
growth,
located
on
or
in
the
vicinity
of
a
public
airport,
or
any
use
of
land
near
such
airport
which
obstructs
the
airspace
required
for
the
flight
of
aircraft
in
landing
or
taking
off
at
such
airport,
or
is
otherwise
hazardous
to
such
landing
or
taking
off.
when
a
sponsor
which
means
a
municipality
or
county
that
wants
to
build
an
airport
submits
a
project
application
to
the
federal
aviation
agency,
it's
required
to
conform
to
the
standards
prescribed
by
the
administrator
and
amongst
the
standards
it
must
conform
to
is
safety
of
approaches.
when
the
f.a.a.
decides
that
the
project
is
feasible
and
is
willing
to
grant
money,
one
of
the
assurance
is
it
requires
of
the
sponsor
is
this.
the
assurance
in
writing
satisfactory
to
the
administrator
that
the
aerial
approaches
to
such
airport
will
be
adequately
cleared
and
protected
by
removing,
lowering,
relocating,
marking
or
lighting
or
otherwise
mitigating
existing
airport
hazards
and
by
preventing
the
establishment
or
creation
of
future
airport
hazards.
and
most
particularly,
in
1964
this
year,
congress
amended
the
federal
airport
act
to
include
as
an
additional
specific
assurance
that
there
would
be
recourse
to
airport
zoning
as
one
of
the
means
to
eliminate
or
mitigate
airport
hazards
and
these
are
the
specific
words
that
congress
used,
that
the
sponsor
was
to
take
appropriate
action
including
the
adoption
of
zoning
laws
that
is
that
such
appropriate
action
has
been
or
will
be
taken
to
the
extent
reasonable
to
restrict
the
use
of
land
adjacent
to
or
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
airport
to
activities
and
purposes
compatible
with
normal
aircraft
operations
including
landing
and
take
off
of
aircraft?
and
the
purpose
i
think
was
succinctly
summarized
by
senator
monroney
who
is
the
chairman
of
the
aviation
subcommittee
of
the
senate
commerce
committee
when
he
said
that
the
object
of
recourse
to
zoning
was
to
be
sure
that
you
do
not
penetrate
the
airspace
necessary
to
safe
operation.
and
by
that
penetration,
airports
can
be
ruined
by
the
construction
of
high-rise
apartments,
smokestacks,
and
similar
buildings
which
encroach
on
the
flight
pattern?
and
one
of
the
things
that
congress
explicitly
has
said
is
that
there
shall
be
airport
zoning
as
one
means
of
preventing
this
kind
of
impediment
to
safe
operation.
now,
when
congress
wrote
that
in
1964,
it
was
not
saying
anything
new.
it
was
confirming
what
the
federal
aviation
administration
and
the
civil
aeronautics
administration
its
predecessor
had
done
from
the
time
that
regulation
of
this
kind
of
a
problem
became
a
federal
concern.
from
the
beginning,
every
grant
agreement
between
a
sponsor
and
the
federal
government
included
as
part
of
the
promise
made
by
the
sponsor
that
the
sponsor
will
either
by
the
acquisition
and
retention
of
easements
or
other
interests
in
or
rights
for
the
use
of
land
or
airspace
or
by
the
adoption
and
enforcement
of
zoning
regulations
prevent
the
construction,
erection,
alteration
or
growth
of
any
structure
tree
or
other
object
in
the
approach
areas
which
would
constitute
an
obstruction
to
air
navigation
according
to
the
criteria
or
standards
prescribed
in
section
a
of
technical
standard
order
n.a.t.
this
is
this
thing
here
so
that
the
grant
agreements
from
the
beginning
required
assurance
that
there
was
going
to
be
aerial
protection
or
protection
to
the
aerial
approaches
either
to
conform
with
t.s.o.
n.a.t.
or
its
predecessors.
this
was
the
scheme
from
the
beginning.
and
from
the
beginning,
the
c.a.a.
later
the
f.a.a.
and
the
n.i.m.l.o.,
the
national
institute
of
municipal
law
officers
promulgated
model
airport
enabling
acts
and
model
ordinances
to
provide
the
machinery
at
the
local
level
for
effectuating
this
federal
concern.
the
state
airport
enabling
act
provided
the
machinery
which
would
enable
the
subunits
of
the
state
government
to
enact
zoning
ordinances.
the
model
airport
zoning
ordinance
translated
into
zoning
language,
the
compliance
with
this
kind
of
protection
for
aerial
approaches.
throughout
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir.
the
technical
standard
order
itself
specifies
--
i'm
sorry.
when
you
said
the
length
of
the
runways,
i
do
not
know
that.
i
know
they
prescribed
the
length
of
the
area
--
of
the
approach
surfaces
from
the
end
of
the
runways.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
don't
know
that
they
prescribed
the
runway
itself.
i
assume
they
must
because
there
are
certain
minimum
standards
which
are
necessary
in
order
to
operate
feasibly.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
is
entirely
correct
and
i
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
think
the
kind
of
an
airport
you
build
is
the
product
of
the
cooperation
above
this
--
the
local
government
and
the
federal
aviation
agency.
both
have
to
get
together
and
agree
that
there
is
a
particular
kind
of
an
airport
which
is
feasible.
the
federal
government
won't
contribute
money
is
to
one
which
is
not
feasible
in
its
view.
the
state
government
or
the
local
government
won't
build
which
is
not
feasible
from
its
point
of
view.
so
that
the
federal
government
is
in
on
the
planning
of
all
these
airports
as
i
understand
it
because
that
is
essential
to
the
contribution
of
federal
funds.
now,
throughout
the
time
that
this
became
a
problem,
that
is
protection
of
aerial
approaches,
there
have
been
expert
studies
in
this
field.
there
have
been
at
least
three
federal
studies.
all
three
concluded
that
you've
got
to
have
airport
zoning.
and
the
idea
was
expressed
about
as
well
by
a
report
of
the
house
committee
on
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
which
we
quote
at
page
30
to
31
of
our
brief.
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
are
being
spent
on
airports.
but
unless
an
airport
can
be
approached
without
encountering
obstructions,
the
investment
therein
becomes
valueless
or
the
airport
itself
becomes
a
deathtrap.
to
protect
passengers
and
flight
crews,
and
to
assure
that
airports
can
be
used
in
connection
with
the
defense
of
the
nation
in
time
of
emergency,
it
is
vital
that
there'll
be
adequate
zoning.
unless
a
zoning
is
accomplished
now,
before
airport
approaches
off
further
obstructed,
the
task
will
someday
reach
staggering
proportions.
few
steps
are
of
such
urgency,
few
steps
are
so
essential
to
promote
safety.
the
idea
therefore
i
think
can
be
summarized
very
quickly.
you've
got
to
have
airport
zoning.
if
you
are
going
to
have
a
safe
airport,
you've
got
to
have
airport
zoning,
if
you're
going
to
protect
the
investment
in
the
airport,
and
you
can't
get
safety
or
protection
of
investment
by
saying
you
can
buy
it
all
because
you
can't
buy
it
all.
as
a
practical
matter,
there
isn't
enough
money
to
buy
it
all.
your
only
viable
alternative
is
to
have
recourse
to
airport
zoning
or
at
least
the
significant
part
of
the
protection
you
need.
now,
i
do
not
understand
that
the
respondents
in
this
case
in
this
court
could
take
any
issue
with
anything
i
have
set
up
until
now.
they
appeared
to
agree
that
airport
zoning
is
valid.
they
appear
even
to
state
that
this
ordinance
on
it
face
is
valid.
they
changed
their
attack
from
an
attack
on
the
validity
of
airport
zoning
to
a
question
as
to
whether
its
specific
avocation
in
this
case
at
this
point
is
bad.
before
going
to
their
version
of
what
this
case
is
about,
i
want
to
say
then
briefly
this.
the
court
below
thought
that
this
ordinance
was
bad
on
its
face,
on
its
interpretation
of
what
this
court
did
in
causby
and
griggs.
in
causby
and
griggs,
this
court
decided
and
only
decided
that
frequent
flights,
low
frequent
flights
over
terrain
which
would
drastically
impair
the
usefulness
of
the
land
underneath
those
flights
effectuated
a
taking
for
which
compensation
was
required.
if
you
were
taking
an
easement
you
had
to
pay
for
it.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
those
decisions.
they
do
not
stand
in
the
way
of
what
we
are
talking
about
at
all.
airport
zoning
deals
with
the
use
of
land
by
the
land
owner,
the
property
owner
which
interferes
with
safe
flight.
causby
and
griggs
deals
with
what
--
what
the
fellow
does
is
flying
the
plane
which
interferes
with
surface
use
of
the
land
to
protect
against
abuses
by
the
fellow
who
flies
the
plain,
you
have
causby
and
griggs.
to
protect
against
abuses
by
the
fellow
who's
got
the
land,
you
have
airport
zoning.
now
if
you
zone
up
to
a
particular
height
for
the
valid
purpose
of
providing
airport
protection,
you
cannot
build
above
that
height
but
you
can
use
the
land
below.
causby
and
griggs
says,
if
with
respect
to
the
use
of
that
land
below
the
height
limitation,
you
are
going
too
long
and
too
often
and
you
would
pair
drastically
the
use
of
that
land,
you're
going
to
have
to
pay
for
the
easement
you
acquire
and
you
will
have
to
pay
for
it.
airport
zoning
does
not
license
interfering
use
of
airspace.
but
the
fact
that
you
have
zone
land,
to
make
it
safe
for
planes
to
operate
does
not
mean
that
you
have
got
interfering
over
flights
through
that
zone
land.
the
two
are
separate.
you
zone,
you
get
a
safe
airport.
if
in
the
operation
of
that
airport,
at
any
particular
point
you
are
having
interfering
over
flights,
you
will
pay
under
causby
and
griggs
for
those
interfering
over
flights.
that's
all
that
causby
and
griggs
says
and
it
doesn't
say
a
thing
which
begins
to
touch
on
the
validity
of
airport
zoning.
as
i
said
in
this
court
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
if
you
have
--
well,
yes
sir.
for
example,
instead
of
providing
for
nonconforming
uses
under
this
ordinance,
they
require
the
elimination
of
a
building.
i
would
assume
that
would
be
a
taking
that
you
have
to
compensate
for
them
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
is
correct
because
this
is
the
same
as
all
zoning
everywhere.
i
cannot
build
outside
of
--
i've
got
a
25
lot
--
25
foot
line
on
my
lot.
i
can't
build
on
that
25
feet.
i've
been
zoned
and
i
might
like
to
use
that
property
differently
but
i
can't.
all
zoning
whether
it's
airport
or
any
other
kind
of
zoning
limits
the
use
of
property,
diminishes
the
uses
to
which
property
can
be
put.
that
alone
cannot
be
invalid
unless
our
whole
concept
of
zoning
wherever
is
applied
is
invalid.
and
obviously
that
is
not
so.
and
obviously
respondent
doesn't
think
it
so
because
it
wants
to
change
the
question.
it
says
we
are
not
talking
about
the
validity
of
this
ordinance
on
its
face.
we
are
talking
about
a
specific
application
of
it.
when
you
go
down
18
feet
in
a
highly
industrialized
area,
you
are
going
down
so
low
that
you
are
taking
the
property
for
which
compensation
is
required.
they
cannot
take
this
position
in
this
court.
that
issue
is
not
here.
the
record
as
made
never
tendered
such
an
issue.
the
cases
tried
never
tried
such
an
issue.
the
cases
appealed
never
had
such
an
issue.
the
record
does
not
present
or
preserve
that
kind
of
a
contention.
and
it
wasn't
in
depth
when
the
respondent
in
the
indiana
courts
restricted
its
attack
to
the
validity
of
the
ordinance
on
its
face.
because
under
utterly
clear
indiana
law,
if
you're
going
to
attack
application,
you
must
first
seek
a
variance
under
the
ordinance,
and
only
after
you
have
exhausted
the
remedies
provided
under
the
ordinance,
may
you
then
go
into
court
and
attack
application.
if
you
have
not
exhausted
your
remedies
and
you
want
to
attack
the
ordinance,
you
are
limited
to
where
an
attack
from
the
ordinance
on
its
face
in
its
entirety.
the
people
here
had
never
sought
a
variance.
the
only
defense
they
could
make
therefore
was
one
that
the
ordinance
was
a
legal
nullity.
so
the
record
never
presented
the
issue.
indiana
law
would
not
have
allowed
the
presentation
of
the
issue,
had
it
been
sought
to
be
raised,
the
court
below
decided
only
the
issue
that
the
record
presented
and
said
this
was
a
legal
nullity,
it
would
have
reached
the
identical
result
whether
you
were
talking
about
18
feet,
28
feet
or
58
feet.
that
was
the
rationality
of
its
decision.
it
could
not
say
it
anymore
plainly
when
it
said
this
ordinance
is
wholly
void.
it's
invalid
as
an
entirety.
this
court
therefore
is
being
asked
to
decide
a
question
which
is
not
here.
the
record
doesn't
present
that
indiana
law
doesn't
allow
it.
the
indiana
supreme
court
and
the
trial
court
didn't
decide
it
and
i
think
that
ends
it
in
this
case,
in
this
court.
now
if
it
doesn't
end
it.
if
we
have
to
consider
invalid
application,
let's
look
at
what
we
have
to
consider.
because
their
version
of
it
is
by
no
means
even
when
this
record
was
shown,
a
comprehensive
version
of
a
problem.
first
of
all,
they
talk
about
a
highly
industrialized
area.
this
area
in
here
is
not
highly
industrialized
at
all.
the
area
here
is
highly
industrialized
and
now
here
it
is,
and
here
it
is
but
not
here,
if
you're
talking
about
application,
this
is
where
the
highly
industrialized
area
is
supposed
to
be.
what
you
have
here
is
the
problem
of
the
river
and
(inaudible)
through
here
and
you
have
the
track
of
a
railway.
and
at
some
place
down
in
here,
you
also
have
residential
construction.
now,
i
want
to
illustrate
what
happens
if
you
try
to
turn
a
case
into
something
that
was
not
tried
below.
i
thought
when
i
looked
at
the
airport
zoning
map
which
is
on
page
158
that
there
was
at
least
a
part
of
the
inner
area
approach
zone
which
residences
were
in
fact
constructed
and
i
quote
it
because
i
looked
at
this
map
and
i
saw
blocks
of
houses
inscribed
and
i
just
thought
these
were
existing
structures.
i
am
told
there
is
not
a
blessed
thing,
nothing
throughout
this
whole
area
here.
it
is
swamp,
it
is
sand,
it
is
scrub
oak,
and
you
cannot
build
anything
on
it
because
you've
got
to
have
the
kind
of
foundation
which
is
not
just
economical
to
construct.
now
if
you
try
to
consider
a
question
of
application
when
it
hasn't
been
tried,
you'll
run
into
the
precise
trap
that
you
look
at
a
map,
you
think
it
shows
buildings.
it
does
show
buildings
but
all
it
means
is
that
somebody
drew
up
a
plan.
that
plan
was
drawn
up
long
ago
and
has
never
been
effectuated
so
far
as
the
actual
situation
is
concerned,
this
is
all
scrub
oak
and
marsh
and
nothing
useful.
now,
i
feel
free
to
say
this
to
this
court
because
it
makes
the
precise
point
i
want
to
make
when
you
talk
about
application,
you've
got
to
try
that
issue.
if
you
don't
try
it,
you
don't
have
the
facts
relevant
to
it.
even
untried,
we
know
that
this
is
not
highly
industrialized.
it
is
swamp
here
and
maybe
there's
a
residence
down
here
on
one
version
of
(inaudible).
we're
told
that's
18
feet.
it's
not
18
feet.
it's
22
and
one
half
feet.
it
only
becomes
18
feet
if
you
spill
the
river
over
to
somebody
else's
property.
now
wherever
this
boundary
line
is,
if
it's
on
the
edge
of
the
river,
if
it's
at
the
(inaudible),
wherever
it's
located,
it
surely
doesn't
license
you
to
take
that
river
and
spill
it
over
in
somebody
else's
property.
so,
what
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i've
got
it.
let
me
finish
this.
i
didn't
have
a
lot
of
time.
what
they're
claiming
is
invalid
application
is
a
prohibition
against
building
on
land
which
requires
you
to
spill
the
riverbed
over
to
somebody
else's
land.
the
rest
of
it
is
in
our
brief
with
respect
to
invalid
application.
there
just
isn't
even
on
their
version
of
it
enough
to
show
on
this
record
that
there
is
any
invalid
application
of
the
ordinance
assuming
this
court
can
even
consider
that
question.
now,
the
independent
and
adequate
statement,
the
court
below
says
as
its
version
of
what
constitutional
law
requires
had
the
adjacent
property
owner
chosen
to
erect
flag
poles,
factory
chimneys
or
tall
buildings
across
the
whole
of
its
land
and
several
times
as
high
as
its
power
line,
it
was
within
its
rights
not
withstanding,
it
might
have
entirely
prevent
the
landing
of
airplanes
at
the
airport.
the
idea
under
the
federal
airport
act
is
precisely
the
opposite
as
summarized
by
senator
monroney,
your
media
airport
zoning
in
order
to
prevent
airports
from
being
ruined
by
the
construction
of
high
rise
apartments,
smokestacks
and
similar
buildings
which
encroach
on
the
flight
patterns.
these
two
ideas
can
not
stand
together.
the
premise
of
the
decision
below
and
the
premise
of
the
federal
airport
act
are
diametrically
inconsistent
furthermore.
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
didn't
raise
anything.
we
were
the
plaintiffs
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
somebody
raised
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
whatever
the
court
below
said,
this
much
is
clear
that
it's
decision
cannot
be
an
adequate
state
ground
because
its
decision
stands,
it
is
in
conflict
with
the
federal
airport
act,
whether
it
took
that
decision
as
an
adoption
of
federal
law
or
it
took
it
as
an
independent
interpretation
of
state
law
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
whichever
way
it
took,
it
cannot
be
an
adequate
state
ground
and
this
is
what
i'm
addressing
myself
to
now
because
it's
in
conflict
with
the
federal
airport
act.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
understand
that
on
the
remand
in
that
case,
the
state
court
held
that
it
had
been
deciding
it
on
a
state
ground.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
first
point,
i
want
to
make
however
is
that
there
is
no
point
to
a
remand
in
this
case
to
get
clarification
as
to
whether
it's
a
state
ground
or
a
federal
ground
because
if
it's
a
state
ground,
it
cannot
stand
as
an
adequate
state
ground
because
of
conflict
with
the
federal
airport
act.
so
whatever
ground
was
taken
below
whether
it
was
a
federal
ground
or
a
state
ground.
that
ground
cannot
stand.
one
of
the
reasons
it
cannot
stand
is
what
i
have
said
now,
the
notions
of
property
that
are
adopted
by
the
court
below
and
that
all
the
premise
with
the
federal
airport
act
are
diametrically
inconsistent.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
i
don't
want
to
use
the
word
preemption
because
for
me,
that
has
a
more
pervasive
connotation
on
the
word
conflict.
my
purposes
now,
i
am
confining
it
to
conflict
that
the
standard
adopted
by
the
decision
below
is
in
conflict
with
the
federal
airport
act.
i
am
not
saying
that
there
may
not
be
standards
adopted
by
a
state
which
would
not
be
compatible
with
the
federal
airport
act.
as
i
understand
preemption,
there
couldn't
ever
be
such
a
thing.
i
am
not
taking
that
position.
i
am
saying
simply
that
with
respect
to
the
kind
of
position
taken
by
the
court
below
in
this
case,
the
total
invalidation
of
airport
zoning
that
is
in
conflict
with
the
federal
act.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir.
it
does
not
say
that
because
this
is
the
precise
point
that
we
are
trying
to
make.
and
i'll
jump
ahead
a
little
bit
of
my
argument
to
make
it.
we
think
that
the
precise
collision
is
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
indiana
wants
airport
zoning.
twice
its
legislature
has
said,
airport
zoning
is
the
policy
of
this
state.
it
said
it
once
when
it
enacted
at
airport
enabling
act
permitting
the
municipalities
to
adopt
zoning
ordinances.
it
is
said
at
a
second
time
when
it
adopted
the
tall
structures
act
which
is,
airport
zoning
or
the
entire
state
except
for
those
municipalities
which
do
not
have
it.
so,
indiana
has
said
through
its
legislative
branch
as
a
matter
of
state
governmental
policy,
we
want
a
zone.
the
indiana
supreme
court
says
as
a
matter
of
the
inherent
attributes
of
property
ownership,
you
cannot
give
effect
to
that
state
policy.
mr.
bernard
dunau
what
is
their
constitution
and
fundamental
law
gets
back
to
what
is
the
judicial
notion
of
what
is
inherent
in
property
ownership.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir
and
their
constitution
says
that
it's
inherently
incompatible
with
property
ownership
to
have
airport
zoning
and
that
premise
of
the
state
constitution
is
in
conflict
with
the
federal
airport
act
which
proceeds
precisely
on
the
other
premise
that
it
is
entirely
compatible
with
property
ownership
to
have
airport
zoning
that
is
the
precise
point
of
collision
between
the
interpretation
of
the
state
constitution
and
the
federal
airport
act.
mr.
bernard
dunau
and
this
is
why,
we
are
here
on
the
merits.
on
the
merits,
we
believe
the
question
is
whether
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution,
airport
zoning
is
or
is
not
invalid.
we
have
tried
to
make
an
argument
to
show
why
it
is
invalid
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
if
it
is
invalid
under
the
state
constitution
as
the
indiana
supreme
court
says
as
a
--
an
interpretation
of
its
own
constitution,
that
premise
of
decision
is
inherently
incompatible
with
the
federal
airport
act.
what
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
but
that
is
precisely
the
point.
you
cannot
zone
without
paying.
that
is
the
point
of
zoning,
that
you
do
not
pay,
that
you
get
a
restriction
of
property
without
paying.
if
you
have
to
pay,
then
you
are
in
the
(inaudible)
of
the
federal
airport
act.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
because
the
federal
airport
act
proceeds
on
the
premise
that
with
respect
to
a
significant
part
of
the
protection
which
you
are
going
to
give
to
aerial
approaches,
you
do
not
have
to
pay,
you
can
zone.
now,
if
you
have
to
pay,
you
are
saying
to
congress,
your
scheme
is
in
a
act,
you
are
proceeding
on
a
premise
which
is
not
permitted
to
you
under
the
basic
law
of
either
the
federal
or
the
state
constitution.
now,
let
me
try
to
illustrate
this
concretely
because
there
is
no
question
about
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
but
if
the
federal
money
doesn't
go
into
it,
then
the
federal
airport
act
and
the
plan
of
having
a
national
airport
plan
goes
down
the
drain.
mr.
bernard
dunau
why?
mr.
bernard
dunau
if
they
don't
have
airports
in
the
state,
you
are
doing
exactly
what
is
not
intended
under
the
federal
airport
act
because
the
premise
of
the
federal
airport
act
is
that
you
will
have
airports
in
indiana,
in
alaska,
in
california,
in
georgia,
in
every
place
in
the
50
states
of
the
united
states.
the
premise
is
that
there
is
power
to
zone.
that
is
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
national
airport
plan
is
predicated
on
the
assumption
that
people
want
airports,
that
they
need
federal
money
to
get
airports
and
that
this
is
the
way
you're
going
to
accomplish
the
federal
purpose
by
conditioning
financial
aid
on
compliance
with
federal
standards.
mr.
bernard
dunau
they
could
do
that
your
honor
but
when
we
talk
that
way
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir
because
when
we
talk
that
way,
we're
talking
fictitiously.
local
government
doesn't
have
the
money
to
build
airports
without
the
federal
aid.
congress
knew
this
and
local
government
knows
this.
that's
why
the
federal
and
the
national
airport
plan
is
predicated
on
a
grant
made
program
because
practically,
it
means
that
you
can
get
federal
standards
achieved
by
conditioning
financial
aid
on
compliance
with
federal
standards.
let
me
just
quote
this
because
i
think
this
sets
up
our
version
of
the
basic
conflict.
the
senate
report
quoting
with
approval
from
the
federal
aviation
administrator
said
this
--
this
power
to
zone
land
around
airports
reposes
in
the
state
and
in
its
political
subdivisions.
if
the
airports
fund
lacks
this
authority
because
the
airport
is
located
outside
the
city
limits,
the
neighboring
city
or
county
does
not
like
the
authority.
if
neighboring
jurisdictions
refuse
to
exercise
this
authority
for
the
welfare
of
their
own
citizens,
the
state
could
act.
we
have
reached
the
point
where
we
should
insist
upon
an
acknowledgment
that
achieving
compatible
land
use
in
the
vicinity
of
airports
is
a
governmental
responsibility
which
must
be
assumed
at
some
jurisdiction
of
level
within
the
state,
the
premise
of
the
federal
airport
act
is
that
power
to
zone
exists,
that
you
will
get
the
power
exercised
by
conditioning
financial
aid
on
it,
the
premise
of
the
decision
below
is
that
--
that
it
does
not
exist
that
the
whole
federal
scheme
is
based
on
a
notion
which
cannot
work
at
least
in
indiana
and
it
cannot
work
in
idaho
because
idaho
has
now
followed
indiana.
it
cannot
work
in
california
according
to
an
intermediate
appellate
court
decision.
it
cannot
work
in
new
jersey.
if
you
allow
the
states
one
by
one,
to
say
airport
zoning
is
incompatible
with
our
state
constitution,
you
are
telling
congress
to
build
yourself
another
statute.
this
one
is
based
on
a
premise
which
won't
work.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir
it
could
and
our
question
here
is
always
whether
we're
against
it.
mr.
bernard
dunau
may
it
please
the
court.
i've
tried
at
the
outset
to
say
that
this
was
not
an
adequate
state
ground
and
i
did
not
direct
myself
to
our
alternative
position
that
it
was
not
an
independent
state
ground.
i
want
to
talk
about
that
for
a
moment.
mr.
cox
has
said,
he
cannot
see
how
this
case
can
be
distinguished
from
causby
and
griggs,
but
the
court
below
used
causby
and
griggs
as
the
foundation
of
its
proceeding.
how
can
you
say,
how
can
anyone
say
that
there
is
an
independent
state
ground
when
the
foundation
for
it
is
this
court's
decisions
in
causby
and
griggs?
it
will
not
do
to
talk
about
the
court
decisions
as
persuasive
authorities
when
the
question
before
the
state
court
is
whether
the
action
taken
is
invalid
under
its
own
constitution
and
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
decisions
of
this
court
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
not
persuasive
authorities.
they
are
controlling,
they
are
compelling.
a
state
court
has
nothing
to
do
but
to
follow
them.
when
the
state
supreme
court
decided
this
case,
on
alternative
contentions
of
federal
and
state
constitution,
and
had
read
this
court's
decisions
and
we
are
told
they
cannot
be
distinguished,
it
had
to
follow
what
this
court
said.
and
if
it
had
to
follow
what
this
court
said,
it
cannot
be
an
independent
state
ground.
furthermore,
the
decision
in
this
case
explicitly
relies
on
the
federal
scheme.
the
court
explicitly
states
that
its
conclusion
is
consistent
with
the
federal
scheme.
it
totally
misconceives
the
federal
scheme.
now
you
take
this,
you
substitute
a
right
reading
of
causby
and
griggs
for
the
wrong
reading
of
the
court
below.
you
substitute
a
right
notion
of
the
federal
--
or
the
federal
scheme
for
a
wrong
notion
of
the
federal
scheme
and
you
cannot
get
this
result
from
the
court
below
if
reason
has
anything
to
do
with
adjudication.
how
can
the
result
be
independent
if
it
is
premised
and
predicated
on
federal
law?
now,
two
very
minor
points;
we
are
told
that
the
contention
was
raised
that
this
question
of
application
was
raised
and
an
isolated
sentence
is
quoted
at
page
248,
"since
they
were
invalid
and
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
appellant,
and
the
word
applied
is
taken
as
being
the
whole
to
do
on
how
you
get
a
particular
issue
raised."
the
word
applied
used
on
that
page
of
the
brief
has
nothing
to
do
with
application
of
the
ordinance
to
the
property
at
that
point
because
the
indiana
toll
road
commission
was
also
taking
the
position
and
this
is
an
exclusive
state
ground
which
the
court
below
did
not
reach
that
because
it
was
the
indiana
toll
road
commission,
a
body
politic,
the
ordinance
did
not
apply
to
it
and
that
is
the
only
sense
at
which
it
ever
use
the
word
applied.
finally,
it
says,
we
had
a
settlement
agreement
at
the
elevation
and
location,
this
record
will
not
support
that
statement
with
the
settlement
agreement
even
if
it's
properly
before
this
court
does
not
approve
the
elevation
or
the
location.
