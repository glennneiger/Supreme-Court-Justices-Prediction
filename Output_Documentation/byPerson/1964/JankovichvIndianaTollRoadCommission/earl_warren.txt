mr.
dunau.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
for
all
practical
purposes,
there
are
some
portions
of
the
transition
zone
upon
which
no
buildings
can
be
built,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
you
start
at
the
farthest
side
of
the
river?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
boundary
line
of
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that's
22
and
one
half
feet?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
dunau.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
wondering
if
--
if
the
particular
effects
of
this
case
weren't
an
issue,
how
they
contribute
$160,000
on
damages?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
the
airport
in
use
or
wasn't
at
that
time
of
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
i
ask
if
the
government
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
prescribed
the
length
of
these
runways.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
i
was
saying
though,
the
airport
for
a
large
city
would
require
one
kind
of
transportation
or
probably
for
a
smaller
city,
it
would
require
another.
and
the
runways
need
not
be
as
long
one
or
the
other.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
determines
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cox.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
a
public
authority.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
alright.
mr.
dunau.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
gentlemen.
