mr.
hugh
b.
cox
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
deal
straight
away
with
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
it
is
plain
that
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
in
this
case
decided
a
question
of
indiana
constitutional
law.
its
opinion
is
at
the
very
end
of
the
record
in
this
case,
it
starts
on
date
--
page
208
if
the
court
cares
to
look
at
it.
i
think
its
page
210.
you
will
see
that
the
court
stated
the
question
before
it
as
including
the
constitutional
question
as
including
a
question
of
indiana
constitutional
law.
it
then
went
ahead
and
cited
the
relevant
provision
of
the
indiana
constitution.
it
cited
in
indiana's
statute
about
property
rights
in
airspace.
it
cited
some
of
its
own
decisions
interpreting
the
indiana
constitution.
now,
i
think
there
can
be
no
doubt
and
i
do
not
understand
the
petitioners
to
deny
that
the
court
below
decided
a
question
of
indiana
constitutional
law.
now
it
is
true
that
it
also
decided
that
this
ordinance
was
invalid
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
this
court
long
ago
held
that
when
a
judgment
of
a
state
court
rests
on
two
grounds,
one
on
state
ground
and
one
on
federal
constitutional
ground
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that
is
one
of
his
arguments.
the
other
argument
is
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
it
the
solicitor
general
in
the
footnote
on
page
2
of
his
brief
dismissed
that
argument
summarily
as
having
no
basis
in
the
law
but
i
will
talk
a
little
bit
about
it.
that
oral
argument
in
the
first
place,
i
will
take
it
on
his
basis
as
to
what
the
court
in
indiana
held
which
is
that
it
held
broadly
that
all
aircraft
zoning
ordinance,
airport
zoning
ordinance,
past,
present
and
the
future
are
invalid.
we
don't
agree
with
that
but
let's
take
that
as
an
assumption.
now
what
that
argument
really
is
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
counsel
for
petitioner
can
escape
from,
is
this,
and
it
seems
to
me
an
extraordinary
argument.
what
he
is
saying
is
that
if
the
constitution
of
indiana
had
in
it
an
explicit
provision
in
this
state,
if
you
wish
to
establish
safe
approaches
for
airports,
you
must
do
it
by
some
regulatory
measure
that
gives
land
owners
compensation
if
their
rights
are
adversely
affected.
his
argument
is
that
that
kind
of
an
explicit
constitutional
provision
would
be
invalid
under
the
supremacy
clause
because
of
the
national
airport
act.
now
i
say
that's
an
extraordinary
contention
because
in
the
first
place,
it
involves
a
limitation
self-imposed
on
a
state
which
doesn't
affect
the
civil
liberties
or
the
rights
of
anybody
else.
but
apart
from
that,
he
is
talking
about
a
field
in
the
statute,
federal
airports
act
which
does
not
in
anyway
conflict
with
that
kind
of
a
policy
if
the
state
wishes
to
adopt
it.
the
federal
airport
act
simply
does
this;
it
sets
out
conditions
which
the
local
authorities
must
meet
if
they
wish
to
obtain
federal
funds
for
the
construction
of
airport.
and
one
of
those
conditions
is
that
the
local
authority
should
buy
some
appropriate
means,
provide
for
safe
approaches
to
the
airport.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
it
doesn't
have
to
be
by
zoning.
it
can
be
by
condemnation
or
the
acquisition
of
property
rights
or
it
maybe
by
zoning
and
i
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
the
amendment
which
counsel
read
to
the
court
which
is
made
in
64
said
that
this
should
be
done
by
appropriate
means
including
zoning.
now,
the
act
specifically
provides
that
federal
funds
maybe
used
for
the
acquisition
of
easements
and
airspace
and
for
title
to
property
that
recognizes
that
state
depending
upon
the
choice
it
wishes
to
make
may
do
this
by
acquisition
of
property
interest.
it
may
do
it
by
zoning.
but
that
statute
does
not
prescribe
any
method
which
the
state
must
follow.
now
that
in
brief
mr.
justice
brennan
is
my
answer
to
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well
i
understand
him
to
argue
that
before
you
ever
get
to
the
supremacy
clause
argument,
that
this
is
not
an
independent
ground
of
decision
because
the
court
in
indiana
cited
some
decisions
of
this
court
as
authorities
and
it
did
--
i
was
about
to
point
out
that
the
fact
it
decided
the
question
under
the
federal
constitution
as
well
as
the
question
under
the
state
constitution
does
not
in
itself
provide
a
basis
for
the
exercise
of
this
court's
jurisdiction
because
this
court
is
held
many
times
if
there
are
two
grounds
one,
a
state
ground
and
one
of
federal
ground
and
the
state
ground
is
sufficient
to
sustain
the
position
below,
this
court
will
not
take
jurisdiction
that
cases
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
that
makes
no
difference
mr.
justice
white
because
this
court
has
said
--
it
said
plainly
in
the
national
tea
case
that
the
fact
that
the
state
court
uses
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
persuasive
authorities
doesn't
give
the
court
jurisdiction.
now
the
interesting
case
in
that
respect
is
the
case
that
the
city
of
new
york
against
the
central
savings
bank
which
is
a
case
stated
in
306
u.s.
where
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
had
held
a
state
statute
unconstitutional
on
both
state
and
the
federal
grounds,
and
in
its
opinion,
it
had
decided
and
relied
upon
decisions
of
this
court
and
not
only
relied
upon
them.
it
had
said
that
it
attached
great
weight
to
those
decisions
and
it
went
a
little
bit
beyond
that.
it
said
that
its
decision
that
the
statute
was
invalid
under
the
new
york
constitution
necessarily
followed
from
its
decision
that
it
was
invalid
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
yet
in
that
case,
this
court
denied
a
petition
for
certiorari
and
noted
in
the
order
that
the
denial
was
because
a
decision
below
rested
on
an
adequate
state
ground.
now,
if
there
is
no
doubt
--
put
it
this
way.
there
is
nothing
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
that
even
remotely
suggests
that
it
was
constrained
or
controlled
or
coerced
by
any
decisions
of
this
court.
it
cited
those
decisions
together
with
its
own
decisions.
it
cited
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
washington
and
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey.
so
that
this
case
is
not
like
a
case,
it
does
not
resemble
a
case
in
which
the
court
below
has
said
something
which
could
suggest
that
it
was
constrained
or
dominated
or
controlled
by
decisions
of
this
court.
in
the
national
tea
case
for
example,
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
in
its
first
opinion
had
said
it
believed
it
was
under
duty
to
follow
the
decisions
of
this
court.
and
the
court
--
supreme
court
of
indiana
didn't
say
anything
like
that
in
this
case
and
of
course
it
didn't
say
anything
that
it
resembles
in
any
way
what
the
new
york
court
said
in
the
case
that
i
referred
to
a
moment
ago.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right.
that's
my
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
quite
true
and
my
position
is
that
the
citing
is
treating
them
as
persuasive
authorities
which
is
what
this
court
said
that
it
could
be
done
without
raising
a
federal
question.
when
i
say
constrained
or
controlled
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
mean
the
language
and
opinion
which
indicates
the
state
court
believed
that
it
had
no
choice
but
to
decide
the
question
in
a
way
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
indicated
that
it
should.
i
think
it
was
treating
those
decisions
as
it
treated
the
other
materials
and
the
opinion
as
authority.
now
how
much
weight
it
gave
them
and
you
can't
tell
but
it
doesn't
--
to
my
standard,
it
makes
no
difference
on
how
much
weight
it
gives
them.
so
long
as
it
was
treating
them
as
authorities
and
not
as
controlling
factors
that
it
had
to
follow.
i
find
nothing
in
the
opinion
that
would
suggest
the
slightest
to
be
that
--
that
there
was
any
need
for
clarification
on
that
point
which
was
the
reason
that
the
court
--
this
court
in
the
national
tea
case
sent
the
case
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
to
make
sure
that
it
was
free
of
the
compulsion
of
this
court's
opinion.
and
in
that
case,
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
said,
yes,
we
are
free
and
decided
the
same
way
on
state
grounds.
now
that
i
think
deals
with
the
question
of
whether
this
court
should
take
jurisdiction
of
this
case.
it
is
our
position
that
the
decision
below
rests
on
an
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
and
that
they
should
be
dismissed.
now
if
the
court
doesn't
agree
with
us
on
that,
we
then
reach
the
question
of
the
merits
case
that
is
whether
this
ordinance
is
invalid
as
applied
to
my
client's
property.
in
the
interest
of
time,
i
propose
to
rather
truncate
my
discussion
at
that
point
but
i
should
like
to
say
two
or
three
things
about
it.
in
the
first
place,
this
as
applied
to
the
existing
property
of
my
client,
this
ordinance
imposes
a
height
limit
of
18
feet.
the
counsel
of
the
other
side,
says
it's
22,
it
doesn't
make
too
much
difference
to
me
but
the
fact
is
that
this
toll
road
which
they
say
violates
the
ordinance
is
now
built
in
a
place
where
the
height
limit
is
18
feet.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
it's
owned
by
the
indiana
toll
road
commission.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
there
is
a
creature
of
the
legislature
of
indiana.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
public
authority,
yes,
quite
so
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well
this
is
a
very
odd
case
mr.
justice
goldberg
when
you
say
that,
i
have
to
say
it
to
you
that
this
toll
road
was
built
where
it
is
and
if
the
elevation
is
built
in
relation
to
the
airport,
by
my
client
under
an
agreement
with
the
city
of
gary
that
if
gary
agrees
that
this
toll
road
could
be
built
right
where
it
is
and
that
the
elevation
is
in
relation
to
the
highway
and
my
client
paid
the
city
and
connection
with
that
settlement
for
that
another
covenants
and
agreements
and
made
in
--
obligated
itself
to
pay
a
$1,500,000.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
so
after
gary,
it
leads
to
the
airport.
and
now,
the
issue
here
is
whether
my
client
must
pay
another
$160,000
by
virtue
of
this
lease
that
was
made
to
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
they
should
be
suing
gary,
they
should
not
be
suing
in
my
opinion
my
clients
but
--
and
then
i
ask
the
court
to
bear
in
mind
two
particular
--
i'm
not
going
to
try
to
take
your
time
to
deal
with
all
these
points
but
in
connection
with
this
matter
of
variance,
and
your
duty
to
exhaust
your
administrative
remedies,
i
asked
the
court
to
remember
that
my
client
did
not
come
into
court
attacking
this
ordinance.
it
did
not
take
the
initiative.
my
client
raised
the
question
of
validity
of
the
ordinance
simply
because
it
was
sued
as
the
matter
of
raising
it
as
a
defense
we're
not
--
we
didn't
take
--
we
didn't
--
we're
not
attacking
the
ordinance
in
the
sense
of
having
gone
to
court
to
attack
it,
we
had
no
reason
suppose
we
had
to
get
a
variance.
so
we
had
agreed
we
could
build
a
road
there.
we
built
it
there
and
then
when
were
sued,
of
course,
--
my
client
raised
the
invalidity
of
the
ordinance
as
a
defense.
what
i
wish
to
--
i
wish
to
say
just
two
or
three
things
more
about
the
merits
and
then
i
shall
submit
that
point
to
the
court
on
our
brief
which
discusses
it
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
impose
this
18
--
18
foot
height
limitation
or
a
24
height
foot
limitation
on
land
that
it's
no
and
this
what
the
court
--
this
court
said
in
the
causby
case.
there's
no
difference
and
if
you
build
an
approach
to
a
bridge
over
my
client's
land
at
18
feet
and
ran
traffic
over
that
bridge
because
that's
what
this
is
about
and
take
all
of
the
airspace
above
18
feet
and
use
it
for
the
passage
of
airplanes.
indeed,
in
the
court
below,
the
petitioners
told
the
supreme
court
in
indiana,
page
24
in
their
brief,
that
by
reason
of
this
zoning
ordinance
and
the
lease
they
had
from
the
city,
they
had
an
easement
in
the
airspace
over
my
client's
land.
now,
i
submit
that
if
they
had
an
easement
that
could
only
be
obtained
by
taking
it
from
my
client
and
that
it
was
a
constitutional
taking
and
it
could
not
be
achieved
without
the
payment
of
compensation.
of
that,
i
think
in
very
abbreviated
form
is
the
essence
of
our
case
on
the
merits.
i
do
not
understand
the
distinction
that
the
petitioners
try
to
make
between
this
case
in
the
causby
and
the
griggs
cases.
in
those
cases,
the
court
--
this
court
held
that
there
was
a
taking
because
intrusion
into
the
airspace
interfered
with
the
use
and
enjoyment
of
the
land.
in
this
case,
the
18
or
22
foot
height
limitation
directly
interferes
with
the
use
and
enjoyment
of
the
land
because
it
prohibits
the
owner
of
the
land
from
putting
any
structures
on
it
that
exceed
18
feet,
from
growing
any
trees
on
it
that
exceed
18
feet.
it
prohibits
a
variety
of
proper
and
normal
uses
of
that
land.
i
do
not
understand
how
this
case
can
be
on
the
taking
point
can
be
distinguished
from
causby
and
from
griggs.
now
there's
just
one
more
thing
i
should
like
to
say,
though
it
seems
to
me
perhaps
unnecessary.
the
petitioner
has
made
something
of
the
point
which
i
don't
completely
understand
but
i
want
to
try
to
deal
with
and
that
is
that
we
are
not
entitled
to
say
in
this
court
that
this
ordinance
is
invalid
as
applied
to
our
property
because
he
says
we
--
apparently,
he
says
or
argues
that
we
attack
it
in
the
court
below
on
the
ground
that
it
was
invalid
as
to
everybody
which
is
a
proposition
that
i
find
a
little
difficult
to
understand
because
the
only
thing
that
was
ever
involved
in
this
litigation
was
the
application
of
the
ordinance
to
my
client's
property.
my
client
was
worried
about
somebody
whose
property
was
backed
three
or
four
miles.
he's
worried
about
his
own
property.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
make
it
clear
that
this
point
was
before
the
supreme
court
of
indiana.
the
brief
which
my
client
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
indiana,
it
commented
on
the
same
exhibits
which
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
talked
about
when
he
said,
we
objected
to
their
admission
because
he
said
the
court
--
the
ordinance
was
invalid.
at
page
248
of
the
brief
that
my
client
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
indiana,
it
referred
to
these
exhibits
and
said
this
--
and
these
are
exhibits
that
show
the
ordinance.
since
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
this
is
248
of
the
brief
in
the
court
below.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
it
was
quite
a
brief.
they
have
a
furious
practice
in
indiana.
the
brief
includes
everything
apparently,
the
record
and
transcript.
this
is
a
reference
to
the
ordinance
and
to
this
map
that
was
attached
to
the
ordinance.
and
my
client
said
this
to
the
supreme
court
of
indiana,
since
they
were
invalid
and
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
appellant,
they
were
inadmissible
and
it
was
a
reversible
error
to
admit
them.
now
that's
the
question
we
put
to
the
supreme
court
of
indiana,
and
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
understood
it
because
at
page
210
of
the
record
in
this
case,
it
stated,
the
constitutional
contention
that
my
client
had
made
to
it
and
it
stated
it
in
this
terms.
we
consider
of
only
appellant's
second
intention,
namely
that
the
provisions
of
the
ordinance
relied
upon
by
appellees
was
unconstitutional
and
that
it
purported
to
appropriate
without
compensation.
now
this
is
the
important
part
--
the
reasonable
and
ordinary
use
of
the
property
on
which
appellant
constructed
the
toll
road.
they're
only
litigating
about
that
property,
we
weren't
litigating
in
abstract
or
about
other
property.
this
was
--
we
made
this
contention
in
the
court
below.
and
even
if
we
hadn't,
i
should
suppose
that
the
normal
course
of
constitutional
adjudication
this
court
would
welcome
an
advocate
who
presented
the
narrower
constitutional
question
rather
than
a
broad
one,
because
this
is
simply
allowed
smaller
constitutional
question.
it
might
be
comprehended
within
a
larger
question
about
the
invalidity
of
the
ordinance
applied
in
some
general
way.
but
that
is
not
what
concerns
my
client.
now
i
think
in
the
interest
of
time,
i
shall
conclude.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
