once
you
relied
on
its
own
statute
when
its
own
decision
is
clear.

first?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
significance
if
they
cited
them
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
indiana
court
may
have
said
airport
zoning
is
unconstitutional
under
its
state
law
but
it
didn't
say
that
having
properly
constructed
airports,
there
was
anything
wrong
with
having
properly
constructed
airport,
all
they
said
was
--
you
shouldn't
--
what
they
meant
by
saying
zoning
is
unconstitutional,
is
it,
you
shouldn't
zone
without
paying.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
have
to
pay,
you're
in
the
teeth
of
the
federal
airport
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
all
that
means
is
that
the
federal
money
won't
go
into
it.

byron
r.

don't
have
airports

justice
byron

they
don't
require
any
state
to
have
an
airport.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
don't
require
any
state
to
have
an
airport.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
federal
government
and
build
it
by
paying
--
by
paying
after
these
rights
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
the
view
of
the
state
constitution
is
somewhat
influenced
by
federal
consideration.
