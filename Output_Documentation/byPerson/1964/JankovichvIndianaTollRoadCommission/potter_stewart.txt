justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
could
have
been,
you
raised
the
state
constitutional
question
though
in
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
beg
your
pardon.
well,
i
mean
somebody
raised
this.
justice
potter
stewart
as
far
as
we
know,
the
indiana
court
has
said
that
the
federal
rule
that
we
adopt
is
a
state
rule.
it's
hard
to
tell
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
something
else.
justice
potter
stewart
we
had
a
case
very
similar
to
this,
minnesota
tea
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
we
couldn't
tell
whether
this
state
was
on
the
federal
ground
or
on
the
state's
constitutional
ground,
we
remanded
it.
are
you
acquainted
with
the
aftermath
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
that
part
of
the
federal
airport
act
might
violate
the
federal
constitution
too.
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me
mr.
cox.
perhaps
--
perhaps
i
don't
correctly
understand.
i
thought
what
he
was
saying,
assume
that's
what
the
indiana
state
constitution
said.
and
that's
the
correct
construction.
nevertheless,
what
the
court
held
was
that
there's
a
conflict
between
the
lack
or
what
he's
urging
is,
that
it's
a
conflict
between
that
interpretation
in
the
state
constitution
and
a
federal
statute
which
under
the
supremacy
clause,
the
constitutional
interpretation
has
to
give
way
to
it.
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
that
one.
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
the
appellants
should
be
suing
gary?
