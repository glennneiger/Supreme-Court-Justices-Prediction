justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
do
you
think
that
(inaudible)
inhibit
the
power
of
the
president
or
the
(inaudible)
operating
pursuant
to
invocation
of
martial
law
to
deny
passports
to
people
to
go
to
an
enemy
country
--
(inaudible)
countries
in
actual
conflict?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
about
to
the
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
of
course
today,
we
decided
in
utah,
i
know
if
you
haven't
had
a
chance
to
read
it
and
if
the
president's
authority
maybe
delegated
to
the
cabinet
officer.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
who
do
we
have
here
(inaudible)
decide
the
question
of
whether
this
statute
(inaudible)
let's
assume
now
in
the
specific
statute
that
is
based
upon
congressional
(inaudible)
--
for
the
united
states
and
the
word
of
the
secretary
makes
this
determination
(inaudible)
your
argument
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you're
suggesting
(inaudible)
that
congress
did
not
make
the
determination,
is
that
part
therefore
(inaudible)
involved
our
country
in
the
war?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
would
the
--(inaudible)
first
amendment
really
do?
as
i
read
this,
i
mean,
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
general
supposed
the
statute
had
said
the
president
or
the
secretary
of
state
himself
may
issue
area
restrictions
in
the
areas
that
the
secretary
finds
with
problem
in
the
area
--
in
the
world.
and
then
the
secretary
issued
an
area
restriction
for
cuba
and
in
such
a
situation
wouldn't
the
appellant
making
a
challenge
such
as
he
makes
here
probably
have
the
three-judge
court?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
of
course
the
united
states
would
pass
the
law.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
mr.
solicitor
general,
your
argument
in
this
(inaudible).
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
to
cuba?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
general,
if
i
may
interrupt
you
at
this
point.
doesn't
the
enactment
of
that
statute,
1952,
drastically
changed
the
nature
of
the
passport
as
you
have
described?
in
one
instance,
you
might
argue
that
the
passport
is
a
credential
issued
by
the
secretary
of
state
which
doesn't
inhibit
your
right
to
travel
but
indicates
that
the
government
isn't
ready
to
vouch
for
you
in
some
areas,
extend
you
diplomatic
protection
etcetera.
when
you
get
that
other
statute
operating
in
conjunction
with
the
passport
statute,
doesn't
the
situation
entirely
change?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
suppose
the
different
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
congress
is
different?
