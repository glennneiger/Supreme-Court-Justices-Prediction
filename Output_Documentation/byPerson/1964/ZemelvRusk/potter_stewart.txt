where
was
it
--
does
--
so
that
my
recollection
can
be
refreshed
--
to
what
country
did
mr.
kent
want
to
go
or
did
he
just
want
a
passport
(voice

--
justice
potter

to
ireland?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
was
denied
any
passport
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
his
alleged
political
--
justice
potter

--
philosophical
beliefs
--
justice
potter
stewart
would
that
be
necessary
in
order
--
for
time
reasons?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
was
wondering
about
that.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
judgment
then
would
properly
be
considered
the
judgment
of
a

--
justice
potter

a
single-judge
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
about
--
well,
which
one
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
there
were
a
couple
of
this
and
there
were
dissenters
here
on
each
one
of
these
issues.
justice

could

justice

well,
he
was
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
was
designated
i
suppose
to
sit
as
a
district
judge
but
they
might
depend
upon
if
you
are
just
considering
a
single
member
of
the
district
court
which
single
member
you
took
here.
justice

en
banc?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
judge
blumenfeld
on
the
basis
of
his
opinion
would
enter
a
judgment
from
that
of
judge
clarie.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
other
american
nations.
do
you
know
anything
about?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice

because
it's
the

it's
to
that

justice

cooperation
was
built
with
those

--
justice
potter
stewart
what
you're
now
emphasizing
is
cooperation
with
those
nations
as
i
understand
it
(voice

--
justice
potter

right.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
was
implicit
in
your
whole
argument
as
i
understood
it.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
his
answer
to
your
question,
if
you
turn
the
question
around
your
way
would
be
--
well,
i
guess
it'd
be,
i
have
a
right
to
travel,
international
travel
absent
some
very
overwriting
consideration
and
you
might
disagree
as
to
what
the
--
how
the
kind
of
consideration
that
might
be.
and
in
view
of
the
law
that
makes
it
illegal
to
travel
internationally
without
a
passport,
that
gives
me
a
right
to
have
a
passport.
now,
wouldn't
that
be
his
answer?
justice
potter
stewart
to
go
to
cuba?
