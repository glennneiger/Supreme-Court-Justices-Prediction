mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
from
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
connecticut
raises
three
issues.
first
is
whether
the
secretary
of
state
has
inherent
power,
executive
power,
or
has
received
statutory
authorization
to
prohibit
travel
to
a
particular
country,
in
this
case,
cuba.
the
second
is
whether
the
statutes,
if
they
give
such
power
are
constitutional,
and
there
is
also
presented
the
question
as
to
whether
--
this
was
a
proper
case
for
a
three-judge
court
which
is
said
in
the
matter.
the
statutes
to
which
i
have
reference
were
of
course
the
statutes
which
were
involved
in
kent
against
dulles
in
a
somewhat
different
connection
but
i
will
refer
to
that
decision
if
i
may.
this
case
arose
when
the
plaintiff,
an
american
citizen
living
in
connecticut
and
holding
a
passport
valid
for
travel,
applied
to
the
secretary
of
state
for
the
endorsement
of
such
passport
for
a
travel
for
cuba.
such
an
endorsement
appeared
to
be
required
because
the
secretary
of
state
on
january
--
in
january
of
1961
had
announced
that
all
existing
passports
were
made
invalid
for
travel
to
cuba
and
that
special
endorsement
would
be
required
if
the
applicant
wish
to
go
to
that
country.
and
he
indicated
in
the
public
announcement
and
in
the
press
release
that
such
endorsements
would
be
given
only
in
cases
in
the
public
interest
referring
to
two
such
cases
specifically,
this
paper
then
and
businessmen
with
pre-existing
business
interest
in
cuba,
referring
of
course
to
american
businessmen.
at
that
time
as
your
honors
know,
it
was
a
crime
to
leave
the
united
states
without
a
passport,
a
crime
established
by
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952.
so
the
plaintiff
applied
for
the
endorsement
of
the
passport
simply
to
satisfy
as
he
said
his
curiosity
and
to
be
able
to
fulfill
his
duties
as
a
citizen,
his
responsibilities
as
a
citizen
and
knowing
what
was
happening
elsewhere,
and
the
secretary
saying
that
he
did
not
come
within
--
either
of
the
exceptions
or
the
broad
general
exception
of
public
interest,
denied
the
application.
whereupon
this
suit
was
instituted
in
the
district
of
connecticut,
and
a
three-judge
court
was
sought
because
the
complaint
requested
it
and
in
the
complaint,
it
is
alleged
that
the
passport
act
of
1926
and
the
immigration
act
of
1952
are
unconstitutional
on
their
face
as
applied.
because
among
the
other
things,
they
interfere
with
liberty
of
movement
and
more
specifically,
they
contain
an
invalid
delegation
of
legislative
power
to
the
secretary
if
construed
as
the
secretary
construe
them.
the
complaint
also
charged
that
the
regulations
themselves
were
not
authorized
by
the
statute
and
were
unconstitutional.
a
three-judge
court
was
appointed
under
section
2282,
and
that
court
after
hearing
the
case
by
a
divided
vote,
upheld
its
jurisdiction
as
a
statutory
court
and
by
a
divided
vote,
a
different
division
held
that
the
appellant
was
wrong
on
the
merits.
the
principal
opinion
written
by
judge
clarie
upholding
the
jurisdiction
of
the
statutory
court,
said
that
the
two
statutes
to
which
i
have
referred
to
which
i
shall
have
to
discuss
at
length,
authorized
the
secretary
of
state
to
prohibit
travel
to
cuba.
judge
blumenfeld,
district
judge,
held
that
--
and
he
stated
in
his
view,
the
core
of
the
action
was
an
attack
upon
the
secretary's
behavior
rather
than
the
statute
that
the
statutory
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
he
said
specifically
that
he
did
not
regard
the
immigration
act
of
1952
as
in
anyway
authorizing
the
secretary's
action
but
he
did
regard
the
passport
act
of
1926
was
giving
such
authority
and
he
said
that
on
the
merits,
the
government
was
correct.
circuit
judge
smith,
agreeing
that
the
court
had
jurisdiction
because
a
substantial
question
was
involved
with
respect
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statutes,
pointing
out
specifically
the
problem
of
delegation
of
legislative
power
which
we
had
raised
without
the
opinion
that
very
likely,
congress
had
the
power
to
authorize
an
area
restriction
or
to
impose
the
area
restriction
but
the
secretary
did
not
have
such
power.
this
case
therefore
comes
to
the
court
with
the
problems
of
inherent
jurisdiction
and
of
statutory
jurisdiction.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes
we
would,
but
not
to
this
court
of
course.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
we
did
not
your
honor.
now,
in
considering
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
we
are
not
under
the
decisions
of
the
court.
in
considering
this
problem,
i
propose
to
discuss
first
the
entire
statutory
framework
in
order
to
achieve
a
necessary
understanding
even
on
the
jurisdictional
problem,
the
2282
problem
then
to
move
into
the
inherent
authority
point
and
then
the
constitutional
point
and
finally,
2282.
and
i
shall
allocate
my
time
for
the
purpose
of
covering
of
all
of
those
points.
the
statutory
framework
is
a
rather
complicated
one.
and
in
considering
it,
we
of
course
bear
in
mind
that
in
kent
against
dulles
involving
these
very
statutes,
this
court
said,
first,
that
if
the
liberty
involved
which
it
described
in
detail,
liberty
of
movement,
the
right
to
travel,
was
to
be
restricted,
it
would
have
to
be
at
least
with
the
action
of
congress
or
have
to
be
in
the
act
of
lawmaking.
and
then
the
court
established
or
set
forth
two
criteria.
first
it
said
that
where
liberties
value
as
this,
liberties
of
movement
are
involved,
a
statute
giving
the
secretary
power
would
have
to
be
narrowly
construed.
and
then,
that
where
the
statute
did
give
such
power
under
such
narrow
construction,
there
would
have
to
be
standards
to
guard
the
secretary
in
determining
how
the
statute
was
to
be
applied
to
restrained
liberty.
the
two
statutes
that
are
involved
here
are
in
a
sense
not
relied
upon
exclusively
by
the
government,
that
is,
the
government
at
no
point
says
that
either
of
these
statutes
actually
gives
the
power
which
it
seeks.
it
attempts
to
achieve
what
is
called
a
symbiosis
between
inherent
executive
power
which
we
discuss
next
and
the
statutory
power.
and
the
language
of
the
language
of
the
government's
brief
is
phrased
in
terms
of
the
statutes
approved
or
ratified
or
the
statutes
give
support
to
the
question
of
inherent
executive
power.
but
i
propose
the
purpose
of
analysis
to
discuss
the
two
statutes
of
the
executive
power
separately.
now
the
first
statute,
the
passport
act
of
1926,
the
court
will
recall
from
the
discussion
of
the
matter
in
kent.
it
derives
from
the
old
act
of
1856,
recodified
in
1902
and
finally
found
its
way
in
1926
in
the
present
form,
substantially
the
same
as
it
has
been
for
more
than
a
hundred
years.
and
this
statute
provides
that
the
secretary
of
state
may
issue
passports
subject
to
such
rules
and
regulations
that
the
president
may
lay
down
and
no
other
person
shall
issue
passports.
on
its
phase,
there
is
of
course
no
reference
to
the
imposition
of
area
restrictions
or
geographic
limitations.
in
kent
against
dulles,
the
statute
came
to
the
court
on
a
claim
by
the
secretary
that
it
gave
sufficient
discretion
to
deny
a
passport
for
political
reasons.
in
that
case,
board
membership
and
the
communist
party
or
plain
membership
of
the
communist
party
and
the
secretary
pointed
in
that
case
to
the
implementing
executive
order
8756,
promulgated
in
1938
in
which
the
president
in
one
section
said,
the
secretary
shall
have
discretion
to
issue,
reject,
to
withdraw,
cancel
and
limit
the
geographic
application
of
passports.
in
this
court,
bearing
in
mind
the
nature
of
the
liberty
involved
and
with
the
criteria
which
i
have
adverted
to,
said
that
despite
this
discretionary
provision
in
the
executive
order
8756
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
i
suspect
in
my
brief
i
put
it
both
ways.
thank
you
--
that
the
congress
had
not
given
the
secretary
this
authority
to
deny
passports
for
political
reasons.
there
is,
i
should
add,
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
when
it
was
originally
passed
really
to
raise
salaries
for
country
officials
in
1856,
and
in
1902
and
1926
would
suggest
any
intention
to
impose
area
restrictions
or
to
authorize
the
secretary
to
do
so.
and
of
course,
1856,
and
1902
and
1926,
there
were
not
in
effect
any
statutes
making
it
illegal
to
leave
united
states
without
a
passport.
and
so
their
passport
at
that
time
as
i
think
the
court
pointed
out
in
kent,
was
mere
convenience.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
kent
wanted
to
go
to
ireland
to
paint.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
ireland
to
paint.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
he
was
denied
any
passport
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
precisely
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
precisely.
now
the
--
oh,
there
were
hearings
held
on
the
act
of
1926.
they
are
referred
to
in
our
brief
and
the
court
will
see
from
an
examination
of
the
hearing
particularly
the
testimony
of
a
very
fine
public
servant
that
says
the
secretary
of
state,
wilbur
j.
carr
to
discuss
not
this
problem
that
there
was
no
mentioned
made
of
the
desire
to
give
area
restriction
power.
and
when
reference
was
made
in
the
question
of
1926
hearings
to
administrative
rules
of
the
secretary
of
state,
he
made
it
to
rule
to
the
secretary
of
state
--
he
made
it
very
clear
that
these
were
minor
administrative
rules
which
were
not
intended
to
burden
the
president
and
we
pointed
--
it
point
this
out
here
as
we
did
in
the
kent
case
were
the
same
proposition.
then
the
government
said
that
there
is
an
administrative
behavior
prior
to
the
act
of
1926
which
somehow
rather
supports
the
claim
that
the
secretary
has
this
power.
on
an
analysis
of
the
very
few
instances
offered
by
the
government,
we
see
that
they
--
insignificant
compared
to
the
number
of
items
which
are
offered
to
the
court
in
the
kent
case
which
are
reflected
in
dissenting
opinions
there
and
in
the
government's
brief.
we
see
also
that
some
of
the
authorities
relied
upon
the
government
here
are
not
cases
where
the
secretary
issued
prohibitions
upon
travel
but
where
a
time
that
a
passport
was
necessary,
the
secretary
refused
to
make
a
passport
valid
for
a
particular
country.
in
other
words,
he
said,
restricted
to
this
country
or
not
applicable
to
this
country.
but
that
did
not
constitute
a
prohibition.
that
did
not
prevent
somebody
in
1936
for
example
from
going
to
spain.
even
though
the
secretary
said,
“no
passports
are
valid
for
travel
to
spain”.
and
when
one
compares,
the
hundreds
of
examples
involved
in
the
several
cases
mentioned
by
the
government,
the
pocket
veto
case,
the
midwest
oil
case,
hundreds
or
thousands
of
examples
in
another
case,
there
is
clearly
no
supporting
precedent
here
which
the
government
can
say
congress
was
aware
of
in
1926
and
that
congress
adopted.
now
the
several
examples
given
by
the
government,
there
is
an
awareness
by
congress
of
what
was
done
but
in
here,
there
is
not
only
--
no
awareness
by
congress
indicated
that
the
secretary
did
something
but
he
did
practically
nothing.
i
will
--
i
should
say
that
when
the
secretary
did
in
may
of
1952,
say
that
in
a
press
release
that
passports
will
not
be
valid
for
travel
to
china.
he
added
in
the
same
press
release
quoted
in
our
brief,
that
this
is
not
intended
to
be
a
prohibition.
and
the
association
of
the
bar
in
its
well-known
study
on
passport
procedures
complimented
the
secretary
of
state
for
his
honest
admission
as
they
said
that
he
didn't
have
statutory
power
to
prohibit
travel
to
cuba
or
to
(inaudible)
--
any
country.
it
may
be
that
this
compliment
was
a
little
premature
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
government
now
rereads
the
press
release
which
it
made
in
1952.
in
considering
the
act
of
1926
and
its
meaning,
as
well
as
the
act
of
1952
which
i
will
refer
to
in
a
moment,
you
also
must
bear
in
mind
the
efforts
made
by
the
government
since
at
least
1957.
to
secure
legislation
which
would
give
this
power
to
prohibit
travel
to
particular
countries,
it
was
in
1957
that
the
massive
report
of
the
government's
--
the
report
of
the
government
on
government
security
--
commission
on
government's
security
was
issued,
relied
upon
by
the
government
in
kent
against
dulles,
referred
to
i
think
in
the
dissenting
opinions
there.
and
that
report
of
representative
of
the
congress
and
representative
of
the
executive
branch,
recommended
that
there'd
be
legislation
which
would
give
the
government,
the
secretary
of
state
power
to
restrict
travel
to
a
particular
country.
it
prohibits
travel
to
a
particular
country.
when
this
court
renders
decision
in
kent
against
dulles
in
june
of
1958,
then
the
president
sent
an
emergency
message
to
congress,
recommending
the
passage
of
legislation
of
two
types
in
a
single
bill
was
presented
to
the
congress.
first,
permit
the
secretary
of
state
to
deny
passport
for
political
reasons.
and
second,
authorize
the
secretary
of
state
to
declare
a
travel
to
particular
areas
could
not
occur.
this
was
not
a
sport,
an
accident,
a
desire
simply
to
shore
up
a
power
clearly
existing
because
extended
hearings
were
held
on
the
particular
bill
and
those
were
introduced
in
one
session
after
another
of
congress
and
hearings
were
held
on
the
subject
and
yet
the
congress
from
1957
to
date
has
failed
to
enact
the
statutory
authority
requested
by
the
administration
and
requested
by
many
senators.
now,
it
seems
to
us
bearing
in
mind
the
federal
trade
commission
against
bunty
(ph)
and
other
decisions
of
the
court
where
it's
indicated
that
attempts
by
the
administration
to
secure
legislature
released
some
evidence.
obviously,
we
don't
think
it's
conclusive
of
a
lack
of
power
but
this
indicates
that
the
passport
act
of
1926,
no
more
authority
for
the
imposition
of
area
restrictions
that
it
was
the
intent
--
the
imposition
of
conditions
relating
to
politics.
i
turn
next
to
the
immigration
act
of
1952
even
though
as
judge
blumenfeld
points
out.
it
is
not
referred
to
in
the
press
release
or
the
public
notice
which
the
government
--
which
the
secretary
issued
in
january
of
1961,
because
we
alleged
in
our
complaint
that
the
government
is
relying
upon
that
statute
as
well.
the
government
answered
to
its
complaint
that
the
statute
as
well
as
inherent
executive
power
authorized
it
to
do
so.
and
at
least
judge
clarie
in
the
court
below
relied
upon
that
statute
as
well
as
the
passport
act
of
1926.
what
then
does
the
immigration
act
say?
passed
in
1952,
i'm
referring
to
section
215,
and
being
essentially
with
modifications
that
i
may
indicate,
a
rewriting
of
the
acts
of
1918
and
1941
both
were
timed
acts.
the
statutes
says,
anytime
of
war
or
of
national
emergency,
when
the
president
proclaims
that
controls
are
necessary,
it
should
be
unlawful
for
an
alien
to
leave
or
enter
the
united
states
without
permission
or
for
a
citizen
to
enter
or
depart
from
the
united
states
without
a
valid
passport.
now
there
is
clearly
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
statute
that
says
the
secretary
shall
have
the
right
to
say
where
the
alien
should
go,
that's
why
i
mentioned
the
alien
example
or
where
the
citizen
shall
go
or
where
the
citizen
shall
come
from.
and
if
one
examines
the
legislative
history
of
the
acts
of
1918
and
1941
there
being
no
special
legislative
history
of
1952
on
this
point,
it
is
perfectly
clear
from
the
committee
report,
from
the
debates
on
the
floor
of
congress,
what
the
purpose
of
congress
was.
it
was
actually
a
border
control
statute,
a
sealing
off
of
the
borders
of
the
united
states
in
war
time.
because
of
the
fact
that
we
didn't
want
american
citizens,
yes,
and
aliens
that
we
believe
guilty
of
espionage
although
we
couldn't
prove
it,
or
would
attempt
to
disaffect
the
armed
forces
or
engages
with
(inaudible)
--
1918
and
other
subversion,
we
didn't
want
to
let
them
come
back
into
the
country.
and
if
they
wanted
to
go
out
of
the
country,
we
didn't
want
them
to
go
out
of
the
country.
that
was
why
the
government
quite
properly
considered
this
at
least
at
some
help
to
it
in
the
kent
case
and
the
government's
kent
brief
develops
this
whole
legislative
history
to
show
that
the
1918
statute
was
directed
at
particular
kinds
of
people
who
were
thought
to
do
particular
kinds
of
things.
of
course
this
court
held
that
that
didn't
apply
to
people
of
particular
political
views
in
the
kent
case.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
1918
or
1941
statutes
would
suggest
that
anyone
had
in
mind
the
giving
of
this
power
to
prevent
travel
to
a
particular
area.
it
is
completely
a
border
sealing
statute.
and
when
the
president
promulgated
his
various
executive
orders
in
1918
and
1941
on
the
subject,
there
is
no
reference
in
those
executive
orders
to
the
question
where
the
person
was
going
to
go.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
discretion
given
to
the
secretary
under
the
act
of
1926.
but
we're
talking
now
about
the
act
of
1952.
now
the
act
of
1952
as
it
comes
before
this
court
was
implemented
by
an
executive
order,
3004
of
january
1953,
predicated
upon
an
earlier
executive
order
of
december
1950
by
a
reason
of
declaring
a
national
emergency
by
reason
of
the
korean
war.
and
in
proclamation
3004,
the
president
said,
by
reason
of
the
prior
existing
national
emergency
declared
in
december
1950,
i
believe
that
travel
controls
--
controls
all
the
entry
and
departure
under
the
act
of
1952
are
required
and
so,
he
declared
in
that
executive
order
--
in
that
proclamation
that
it
should
be
unlawful
for
any
citizen,
pass
over
the
alien,
to
depart
from
or
enter
the
united
states
without
a
valid
passport.
not
a
word
there
about
area
limitations.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
there
--
i
say
that's
true.
i've
seen
in
another
case
the
argument
made
that
the
less
amounts
(inaudible)
--
the
greater
must
include
the
lesser
and
on
the
phase
of
it,
it
seems
like
a
reasonable
argument
except
that
we're
dealing
with
two
different
things.
if
you
read
the
legislation
of
1918,
you
will
see
that
the
congress
was
determined
to
keep
people
out
or
to
keep
them
in.
there
was
no
suggestion
made
there
that
we
could
determine
particularly
in
the
foreign
relations
point
which
is
involved
here
or
for
any
reason
that
a
person
could
go
to
a
particular
country.
well,
i
think
that
logically,
there
is
this
lesser
--
greater
argument
that
can
be
made.
it
happens
not
to
be
the
realistic
situation
that
confronted
congress
when
it
passed
the
acts
of
1918
and
1952.
it
really
meant
to
keep
american
citizens
out
or
to
keep
them
in
and
it
was
completely
indifferent
in
the
very
long
legislative
history
to
where
they
were
going.
we
were
establishing
a
class
of
citizens
in
the
act
of
1918
and
41
and
52,
a
class
of
citizens
who
were
so
dangerous
that
they
should
not
to
be
allowed
to
have
movement
across
the
american
border.
there
was
no
suggestion
there
and
at
any
time
that
we
were
concerned
about
where
they
were
going.
from
my
point
of
view,
an
espionage
agent
should
not
be
allowed
into
the
country
even
if
we
couldn't
prove
that
he
was
going
to
be
such
an
agent.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
more
about
the
act
of
1952,
the
immigration
act
in
answer
to
some
of
the
questions
raised
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
particularly.
the
first
is
that,
we
are
dealing
with
two
different
kinds
of
things
if
i
hadn't
made
that
clear
--
my
view
on
it
before.
we're
dealing
in
the
present
case
with
an
attempt
by
the
secretary
of
state
to
prescribe
travel
to
a
particular
area
in
the
interest
of
the
foreign
affair's
power
which
he
articulates.
and
the
intention
of
congress
in
the
acts
of
1952,
1918,
and
1941
to
declare
that
a
certain
kind
of
person
can
be
kept
out
or
in
so
that
we
are
--
when
we
deal
with
different
kinds
of
elements,
it
is
unfair
to
make
this
a
greater
than
and
a
lesser
fatal.
the
second
is
that
of
course,
the
government
itself
in
its
brief
says
not
that
the
act
of
1952
gives
the
authority
to
impose
area
restrictions
but
referring
to
page
56
and
57
of
its
brief.
it
says
that
the
statute
and
the
government
uses
careful
language
as
always,
confirms
the
authority
of
the
secretary
to
impose
area
restrictions
that
congress
must
have
been
aware
of
the
secretary's
passport
restrictions
although
how
it
doesn't
say,
and
that
the
new
provision
was
not
intended
to
curtail
the
existing
discretion
of
the
executive,
something
quite
different
from
saying
that
the
new
provision
was
intended
to
give
a
power
to
the
executive.
and
finally,
we
must
remember,
i
think,
that
this
court
did
say
in
kent
that
it
would
construe
narrowly
all
delegated
powers
that
curtail
or
dilute
the
liberty
of
movement
and
civil
liberties.
and
if
the
statute
of
1952
were
all
susceptible,
of
two
different
meanings,
i
think
under
this
principle,
the
meaning
which
i
ascribe
to
it
supported
by
the
only
legislative
history
on
the
subject
would
have
to
be
the
one
given,
given
the
choice
of
meanings,
the
nature
of
the
liberty
must
determine
the
construction
given
to
statutes.
i
should
also
say
that
the
statute
contains
no
standards
at
all
nor
as
the
president's
proclamation
3004
and
that
in
itself
as
a
double-barreled
operation
as
this
court
has
pointed
out.
first,
it's
a
way
of
construing
the
statute.
if
it
doesn't
have
standards,
if
it
is
too
vague,
we
try
to
give
the
statute
a
construction
which
would
not
interfere
with
civil
liberties.
finally,
if
the
statute
must
be
given
that
meaning
and
we
come
to
our
next
to
the
last
point
then
it
would
be
declared
unconstitutional.
i
don't
think
the
court
will
have
to
come
to
that
decision
here
anymore
than
it
did
in
kent.
but
now,
i
do
want
to
turn
because
it
is
a
major
part
of
the
government's
brief,
intertwined
with
the
statutory
argument
to
the
question
of
inherent
executive
power,
we
think
that
the
court
meant
exactly
what
it
said
in
kent.
when
it
said,
if
that
liberty
is
to
be
regulated,
talking
about
liberty
of
movement,
the
right
to
travel,
it
must
be
regulated
pursuant
to
the
law
making
functions
of
the
congress.
and
aside
from
the
court's
conditions
to
how
that
law
making
power
was
to
give
authority
to
the
secretary,
our
emphasis
here
is
that
the
inherent
power
theory
of
the
government
is
inconsistent
with
the
lawmaking
principle
laid
down
in
the
kent
case,
citing
youngstown
against
sawyer.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
do
think
your
honor
that
in
the
case
of
actual
war,
we
are
in
a
very
special
situation
that
was
suggested
in
kent
case
and
i
don't
want
to
that
far
when
we're
dealing
with
actual
war
and
not
dealing
with
the
problem
of
foreign
policy.
let's
close
the
problem
there.
there
is
an
historic
practice
of
preventing
civilians
in
going
to
enemy
occupied
territory,
the
area
of
conflict,
but
of
course,
that
neither
new
york
nor
cuba
happens
to
be
in
the
terror
of
conflict.
now,
i
do
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
think
that
was
a
special
situation
and
of
course
congress
acted
to
that
by
a
resolution.
i
think
when
you
had
a
crisis
of
that
kind,
fortunately,
we
all
think
it's
passed
because
we
have
a
very
special
situation
which
should
not
however
be
a
justification
for
a
continuance
of
a
situation
of
controls
in
a
subordinate
official
after
all,
the
secretary.
but
it
was
only
the
secretary
who
decides
that
the
travel
should
not
be
permitted
to
go
to
cuba.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
i
heard
that.
i
turned
pale
for
a
second.
but
i
remembered
that
there
was
somewhat
of
a
difference
between
the
rights
involved
there
and
the
liberty
of
travel,
particularly
in
view
of
what
your
honor,
the
court
has
said
through
your
honor
in
aptheker
on
the
relationship
of
the
right
to
travel,
to
freedom
of
speech
and
to
association.
i
think
that
it
is
true
that
in
some
situations,
the
discretion
can
be
delegated
but
i
think
here,
not
only
is
there
no
delegation
specifically
set
forth
by
the
president
to
authorize
under
this
act
of
1952
to
authorize
area
restrictions.
but
there
are
no
standards
whatsoever,
nothing
with
regard
to
the
secretary
of
state
and
it
is
a
very
important
restriction
upon
liberty.
now
of
course
the
secretary's
authority
under
the
inherent
power
authority
is
claimed
in
this
case
to
exist
despite
what
the
court
said
in
kent.
despite
what
was
said
in
a
very
serious
situation
as
the
court
knows
in
youngstown
with
respect
to
inherent
executive
power,
the
actual
korean
war.
it
is
said
that
to
--
kent
is
said
to
be
distinguished
on
the
following
grounds.
first,
it
is
said
that
kent
involved
the
right
of
exit,
not
the
right
to
travel.
i
think
we
can
pass
that
off
into
somewhat,
with
all
due
respect,
make
way
to
argument
because
kent
officially
talks
about
the
right
of
liberty
of
movement
as
did
the
court
in
aptheker
and
actually,
the
right
of
exit
has
a
very
little
meaning
if
it's
not
an
exit
to
go
somewhere
and
to
do
something.
and
when
one
considers
what
the
court
has
said
about
the
function
of
travel
in
terms
of
making
one
a
better
citizen
in
seeing
what
is
happening
elsewhere
so
that
he
can
participate
in
the
citizen's
processes
of
government,
then
to
say
there
is
no
liberty
of
movement
but
only
a
liberty
of
action
is
i
think
doesn't
really
have
to
be
answered
very
much.
the
second
argument
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think
the
missile
crisis
represents
an
actual
war
time
or
equivalent
to
war
time
situation
and
that
if
there
were
a
claim
of
eminent
danger
to
the
united
states
in
the
instant
situation,
we
might
then
have
to
face
the
problem
of
the
president's
powers
as
commander-in-chief.
but
as
i
will
indicate
in
my
argument
on
the
constitutional
point
mr.
chief
justice,
the
government
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
there
is
no
danger
to
the
united
states
in
the
current
situation
that
what
it
is
doing
is
in
the
interest
of
a
foreign
policy,
restricting
the
liberty
of
the
citizen.
when
we
approach
war
of
any
kind
then
i
think
we
have
to
have
--
and
i
think
that
was
indicated
also
in
kent.
have
to
have
new
sights
and
new
approaches
to
the
problem
to
qualitative
difference.
and
my
argument
does
not
hold
that
a
situation
of
war
or
its
equivalent
or
of
actual
danger
to
the
security
of
united
states
that
we
are
not
faced
with
a
different
criterion
and
greater
rights
in
the
president.
the
instant
case,
the
government
also
says
that
this
is
foreign
affairs
because
a
passport
is
a
diplomatic
argument,
diplomatic
instrument
but
of
course,
the
court
dealt
with
that
problem
specifically
in
kent.
and
then
it
says
that
kent
involved
political
association
but
of
course,
it
is
not
only
in
cases
of
political
associations
that
the
lawmaking
power
of
congress
is
the
only
power
that
can
operate
and
take
away
rights
if
it
could
take
away
them
there.
in
youngstown,
it
didn't
involve
critical
association.
so
i
think
we
come
really
to
the
basic
argument
of
the
government
and
that
is
this,
and
it
will
--
that
somehow
rather
--
because
the
president
is
the
organ
as
the
government
says
in
the
field
of
foreign
affairs
though
it
doesn't
say
for
some
purposes,
an
exception
must
be
made
because
this
says
the
government,
a
foreign
affairs
problem.
and
the
government
cites
two
kinds
of
cases,
first
is
the
curtiss-wright
and
the
waterman
steamship
company
case,
chicago
and
southern.
in
both
cases,
the
court
will
recall
there
were
statutes
involved
and
the
use
of
the
president's
--
the
reference
to
the
president's
importance
as
the
organ
of
the
united
states
government
in
dealing
with
foreign
affairs
was
in
the
first
case
in
determining
to
this
right,
whether
there
were
sufficient
standards
in
the
statute
sufficient
to
authorize
the
president
to
invoke
the
arms
embargo
in
the
chaco
county.
and
in
the
second
case,
the
waterman
case,
the
question
was
raised
in
connection
with
the
reviewability
by
the
courts
of
a
c.a.b.
order
which
have
the
approval.
it
was
implemented
by
the
president
in
connection
with
international
airways.
and
there,
it
was
said
that
because
of
the
president's
support
and
function
and
inability
to
tell
the
courts
or
unwilling
to
tell
the
courts,
the
reasons
which
motivated
him
that
this
was
not
subject
to
judicial
review
after
the
c.a.b.
had
acted.
but
in
both
of
those
cases,
we're
dealing
with
statutes
and
the
government
presents
a
little
more
difficult
situation
or
i
think
answerable
when
it
talks
about
cases
where
there
were
no
statutes
and
we
have
there
the
litvinov
assignment
cases
in
united
states
against
pink
and
united
states
against
belmont.
but
a
reading
of
those
cases
indicates
that
the
theory
upon
which
the
court
based
its
decision
whether
the
foreign
relations
power
of
the
federal
government
were
superior
to
the
policy
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
that
in
both
cases,
in
neither
case
where
they
have
property
rights
much
less
liberties
of
individual
resident
in
or
citizens
of
the
united
states
were
involved.
in
belmont,
the
court
--
i
think
through
mr.
justice
douglas,
pointed
out
that
belmont
was
a
mere
stakeholder.
he
said
he
thinks
that
some
russian
insurance
company
owners
ought
to
have
the
money
instead
of
the
united
states
government
but
he
didn't
claim
the
money.
and
in
united
states
against
pink,
it
maybe
confusing,
pink
and
united
--
the
justice
involved
united
states
against
pink.
the
court
also
made
it
clear
that
all
domestic
creditors
had
been
paid.
now
we
were
dealing
utmost
with
the
question
of
whether
foreign
creditors
should
be
paid
as
against
the
right
of
the
united
states
and
they
are
the
federal
policy
with
how
it's
superior
to
the
state
policy.
now,
i
do
not
think
that
these
cases
which
are
very
special
cases,
established
an
inherent
executive
power
and
of
course,
no
judge
in
the
court
below
came
to
that
conclusion.
and
it
does
seem
to
us,
passing
over
what
i
have
discussed
before,
the
attempt
to
get
legislation
for
eight
years
which
have
a
bearing
also
on
the
inherent
executive
power.
i
think
that
what
we
have
here
in
the
sense,
an
attempt
to
bring
back
the
old
writ
ne
exeat
and
as
this
court
held
in
the
blackmer
case,
whatever
vestigial
remains
there
are
of
the
writ
ne
exeat
regno
are
in
the
congress
rather
than
in
the
president
of
the
united
states.
this
brings
us
to
a
hard
issue
which
the
court
may
or
may
not
have
to
face,
namely,
the
constitutional
issue.
and
we
have
to
turn
to
determine
what
it
is
that
the
government
says.
we
have
to
determine
to
public
notice
179
at
record
68
and
to
press
release
number
24
in
record
69.
and
there,
the
government
says
essentially
that
it
will
not
allow
american
citizens
to
go
to
cuba
because
of
the
breach
and
diplomatic
relations.
and
turning
to
record
69,
because
that
breach
has
prevented
–
prevents
the
united
states
from
giving
normal
protective
services
for
people
visiting
cuba.
now,
i
would
submit
to
your
honor
that
examination
of
the
government's
brief
would
show
that
factually,
there
is
no
indication
that
there
is
any
inability
to
extend
diplomatic
protection
to
american
citizens
to
cuba
and
that
the
swiss
embassy
there
has
been
most
effective
in
numerous
things
whether
they
involve
individuals
or
the
return
of
airplanes
or
the
return
of
fishermen
--
cuban
fishermen
from
the
united
states
to
cuba
in
representing
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
and
if
the
record
of
events
immediately
preceding
january
1961
and
those
which
followed
with
americans
in
cuba
playing
chess,
attending
brain
con
--
surging
conventions
and
so
forth,
they
are
two
there
now
actually.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
i
did
not
mean
that
your
honor.
i
would
argue
something
different
in
that
case
namely
that
the
liberty
of
movement
of
the
american
citizen
as
such
that
even
if
there
were
a
danger
of
american
citizens
being
injured,
they
should
have
the
right
to
make
the
choice
rather
than
the
secretary
of
state
even
though
he
was
so
authorized
by
congress.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
court
would
make
the
evaluation
of
the
particular
case
as
to
whether
the
danger
and
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
i
am
saying
that
although
as
i
say,
not
necessary
for
me
to
urge
out
here.
i
am
saying
that
because
i
think
that
we
have
for
many
years
allowed
american
citizens
to
go
to
countries,
not
only
countries
with
which
we
have
broken
diplomatic
relations,
but
countries
which
we
have
not
recognized
like
the
soviet
union
from
1923
to
1933
when
we
allowed
american
citizens
to
go
there.
and
that
they
--
there
is
no
indication
at
all
historically
that
there's
a
relationship
between
recognition,
diplomatic
relations
and
protective
services.
if
i'm
--
don't
want
to
avoid,
your
honor's
question
which
really
wasn't
on
the
diplomatic
level
and
my
answer
is
that
we
would
argue
if
these
were
a
case
like
that,
that
the
american
citizen
had
a
right
to
make
the
determination.
and
just
as
exception
has
been
made
in
the
past,
the
newspaper
correspondence
who
wanted
to
go
i
think
to
albania
where
the
secretary
of
state
saying,
“now,
remember
you're
going
on
your
own
risk
and
you
have
to
admit
that
you're
doing
so.”
so
i
think
that
going
on
your
own
risk
is
also
a
right
of
the
american
citizens.
but
the
reason
why
i
don't
think
i
have
to
press
the
point
here
besides
the
fact
that
no
statute
has
said
so
is
because
that
does
not
appeared
to
be
the
real
basis
of
the
government's
argument.
the
government's
argument
is
a
little
different.
it
says,
“cuba
is
engaged
in
an
effort
to
subvert
latin
america
generally.
the
best
way
to
handle
cuba
is
to
put
it
in
a
form
of
coventry,
prevent
any
kind
of
communication
certainly
of
persons
between
cuba
and
latin
america.”
we
ourselves
are
not
worried
to
united
states
about
this
kind
of
subversion
of
our
country
but
in
order
to
furnish
a
good
example
to
latin
america,
we
must
prevent
our
citizens
from
traveling.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
would
have
serious
questions
as
to
whether
the
united
states
government
through
congress
could
prevent
american
citizens
from
traveling
because
they
would
spend
money
abroad.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
even
to
conserve.
yes,
i
would
have
serious
consideration.
i
would
not
--
other
way
have
any
reservations
--
not
involved
in
that
case
at
the
moment
with
respect
to
the
right
to
declare
an
embargo
on
trade.
but
i
do
think
that
the
relationship
between
travel
and
the
first
amendment
freedom
is
so
great
that
even
given
with
this
particular
situation
your
honor
has
adverted
to.
i
would
not
recognize
the
power
of
congress
to
prevent
such
travel.
as
i
explained
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
what
he
essentially
wants
to
do
is
what
i
thought
the
court
had
indicated
sympathy
for,
namely,
to
learn
what
was
happening
in
another
country.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
precisely.
not
to
rely
exclusively
upon
--
i
don't
want
to
say
white
papers
but
to
raise
--
not
to
rely
exclusively
upon
government
publications,
press
releases
and
newspapers.
and
i
think
one
of
the
problems
who
indicated
the
whole
china
situation
is
this
(inaudible)
of
news
and
ignorance
on
the
part
of
the
american
people
as
to
what
has
--
happening
in
these
countries.
see
the
bad
and
the
good.
now,
we
think
that
even
if
we
were
not
dealing
with
so
important
a
right
as
liberty
of
movement,
it
would
be
improper
to
prevent
american
citizens
from
traveling
for
the
purpose
of
furnishing
an
example
to
another
country
or
to
another
group
of
countries.
but
when
we
consider
and
i
shall
not
repeat
because
the
court
is
more
familiar
than
i
am
with
what
it
had
said
in
aptheker
in
the
several
opinions
there
and
in
kent
about
the
importance
of
the
right
to
travel.
and
it
does
seem
to
me
that
even
if
we
do
want
to
furnish
a
good
example,
we
can't
do
it
by
taking
away
the
right
of
the
american
citizens
to
travel.
i
may
point
out
that
in
one
of
the
mini
--
foreign
minister
conferences
which
a
resolution
was
passed,
we
persuaded
or
agreed
with
our
allies
in
latin
america
that
we
would
prevent
all
citizens
or
discourage
the
travel
of
all
citizens
subject
to
the
constitutional
rights
or
provisions
of
each
country.
of
course
in
this
case,
we're
talking
about
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
it
is
relevant,
i
think
also
to
bear
in
mind
that
no
other
of
our
democratic
western
allies
has
found
this
kind
of
a
restriction
upon
travel,
a
blindfolding
technique
basically
necessary
for
its
functioning,
any
more
than
in
the
kent
case.
we
are
able
to
point
out
--
we
pointed
out
to
the
court,
any
of
our
western
allies
found
that
a
restriction
upon
travel
for
political
reasons
was
necessary.
and
--
well
obviously,
we
aren't
bound
by
their
failure
to
adopt
equally
restrictive
measures.
it
is
of
some
relevance
and
has
been
indicated
by
the
court
what
other
civilized
democratic
nations
have
thought
--
it
proper
to
do
with
respect
to
their
citizens.
i
think
i
have
made
it
clear
that
when
we
moved
into
the
field
of
trade,
possibly
money,
possibly
finances,
different
criteria
might
be
applied
but
not
when
we're
dealing
with
the
right
to
travel.
now
i
would
like
to
turn
last
to
the
statutory
problem
which
obviously
concern
the
court
which
postponed
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
and
that
is
whether
or
not
we
came
--
we
sued
properly
under
section
2282.
we
have
two
things,
first,
we
think
that
the
government
statement
of
the
governing
rules
is
incorrect.
and
secondly,
we
think
we
have
met
even
the
criteria
set
forth
by
the
government.
perhaps,
in
order
to
be
sure
i
don't
lose
my
time,
i
ought
to
say
that
we
have
complied
with
the
government's
claim
of
the
appropriate
criterion
because
what
the
government
said
essentially
is,
“you
must
attack
if
you
want
a
three-judge
court,
a
statute
on
its
face.”
it
suggest
by
its
permissive
compulsory
dichotomy
argument
that
if
you
are
merely
attacking
a
statute
as
unconstitutional
because
of
something
which
the
regulatory
administrative
body
has
done
pursuant
to
it,
you
are
not
attacking
the
statute
under
section
2282.
now,
2282
does
not
say
in
terms
that
one
cannot
--
one
must
not
seek
an
injunction
under
it
unless
you're
attacking
a
statute
as
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
would
suggest
the
contrary.
when
the
government
refers
to
the
phillips
case
and
the
bransford
cases
as
authority
here,
the
court
will
note
that
in
neither
of
those
cases
was
the
statute
attacked
as
unconstitutional
in
the
complaint.
and
indeed
in
bransford,
the
court
itself
said
that
if
the
statute
had
been
sought
to
be
attacked
in
its
application,
this
would
have
been
a
proper
case
for
three-judge
court,
a
case
with
the
2281
but
the
basic
principle
on
application
we
think
is
reasonable.
when
the
government
says
that
william
jameson
against
morgenthau
is
a
direct
authority
against
us,
it
is
pointing
to
a
case
in
which
this
court
said
that
no
substantial
attack
upon
the
statute
involved
had
been
made.
and
the
government
cannot
very
well
assimilate
that
case
to
this
by
saying
that
our
constitutional
attack
on
the
statute
is
frivolous.
we're
not
attack
is
based
in
part
upon
what
this
court
itself
said
in
kent,
namely,
that
questions
of
delegation
of
legislative
authority
raise
serious
constitutional
questions.
so
that
even
if
we
are
doing
--
and
i
may
add
that
we
have
an
analogy
under
28
u.s.c
1257,
subdivision
2
on
the
appeal
from
the
highest
court
of
the
state
to
the
supreme
court,
to
this
court
where
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
statute
is
joined
in
question
and
i
think
it
was
in
the
dansky
(ph)
case
where
this
court
and
other
cases
has
held
that
constitutionality
drawn
in
question
includes
drawn
as
applied
and
not
merely
drawn
--
not
merely
on
its
face.
and
i
think
with
mr.
justice
holmes
in
one
of
the
cases
we
have
cited
had
pointed
out
as
an
ascent.
you're
always
attacking
a
statute
or
almost
always
as
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
a
particular
situation.
the
fact
that
we
in
this
case
are
also
alleging
that
we
do
not
regard
the
statutes
as
applicable,
as
authorizing
the
action,
doesn't
derogate
from
our
right
to
attack
the
statutes
as
unconstitutional
and
doesn't
diminish
our
obligation,
not
merely
our
right,
our
duty
to
seek
a
three-judge
court
if
we
want
to
enjoin
the
operation
of
the
statute
insofar
as
it
authorizes
the
imposition
of
area
restrictions.
and
the
reference
by
the
government
to
kent
against
grail
(ph)
where
we
didn't
--
where
kent
did
not
seek
a
three-judge
court
is
again
not
a
pra
po
because
a
reading
of
the
complaint
in
the
kent
case
drawn
--
not
by
me
but
one
of
my
associates
showed
that
it
did
not
affect
the
constitutionality
of
the
statutes
at
all
and
suggested
--
and
instead
argued
that
the
regulation
of
the
secretary
of
state
and
only
the
regulations
were
in
violation
of
the
constitution
and
that
they
were
not
authorized
by
the
act
of
1952
or
the
passport
act
of
1926.
but,
as
i
say,
since
--
oh,
let
me
accept
the
government's
criterion
that
a
statute
must
be
attacked
upon
its
face.
and
so
i
refer
your
honors
was
respectfully
to
paragraph
15th
of
our
complaint,
page
4
of
the
record
where
we
say,
the
passport
act
to
the
immigration
act
are
unconstitutional
both
on
their
face
and
as
applied.
because
on
their
face,
they
had
to
feel
the
plaintiff's
rights
and
set
forth
liberty
of
movement
because
they
are
construed
and
applied
to
prevent
travel
even
in
the
absence
of
an
actual
emergency.
and
(c),
they
contain
no
standards
and
are
therefore
an
invalid
delegation
of
legislative
power.
and
we
therefore,
in
paragraph
18
(b)
on
page
5
of
the
record,
seek
a
decree
enjoining
the
defendants
from
carrying
out
or
enforcing
the
said
statute
as
aforesaid.
there,
it
seems
to
me
we
come
clearly,
not
merely
with
the
right
to
sue
under
2282
but
with
the
obligations
to
do
so.
i
will
reserve
some
portion
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
i
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
turning
first
and
briefly
to
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
it
seemed
to
us
that
this
is
precisely
the
kind
of
case
where
2282
is
applicable
and
that
the
suggestion
made
that
there
is
a
pleader's
choice
which
is
improper.
it's
refuted
by
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
mendoza-martinez
case
where
precisely,
the
pleader
was
able
to
determine
whether
it
should
be
a
three-judge
court
as
in
cort
--
rusk
against
cort,
or
a
single
judge
court,
and
that
the
substantiality
of
our
attack
on
the
delegation
of
authority
is
manifested
in
what
judge
smith
said
in
the
court
below,
from
what
this
court
said
on
the
subject
of
standards
and
vagueness
in
kent,
from
the
nature
and
the
liberty
involved,
and
from
the
fact
that
we
have
no
standards
in
this
case
not
merely
inadequate
standards.
because
the
government
essentially
relies
upon
the
act
of
1926,
which
is
implemented
by
executive
order
7856
which
says
the
secretary
shall
have
discretion
to
deny
passports,
to
revoke
them,
to
withdraw
them,
to
limit
them,
but
no
statement
in
that
executive
order
or
proclamation
--
executive
order
as
to
what
the
circumstances
are
under
which
this
now
apparently
unlimited
discretions
to
be
exercised.
and
as
one
listens
to
the
solicitor
general's
most
able
argument
and
reads
this
most
able
brief,
brilliant
but
unrealistic,
the
--
one
realizes
that
the
government
is
here
admitting
that
there
was
an
inherent
power
exercised
to
deny
passports
but
not
to
deny
travel.
and
it
relies
upon
that
in
conjunction
with
two
statutes
which
no
one
here
has
suggested
in
terms
of
analysis
of
language
or
legislative
history
were
intended
by
the
congress,
not
manipulated
in
terms
of
the
handling
of
a
legal
argument
but
intended
by
congress
to
give
this
power
to
prohibit
travel.
and
i
am
sympathetic
with
the
approach
used,
the
reference
of
the
solicitor
general
to
a
discretion
given
by
the
use
of
the
word
“may”,
or
at
least
i
would
have
been
sympathetic.
you
se
of
the
word
“may”
in
the
act
of
1926
and
to
the
discussion
given
to
the
secretary
of
state,
but
i
am
foreclosed
and
i
thought
he
was
before
i
read
the
brief
by
the
fact
that
this
court
in
kent
had
the
same
act
of
1926,
the
same
use
of
the
word
“may”
and
did
not
regard
that
or
the
executive
order
7856
as
giving
the
kind
of
uncontrolled
discretion
which
its
secretary
claims.
now,
the
--
it
must
be
recognized
that
the
discussion
of
an
open
society
is
very
important
to
all
of
us,
but
i
wonder
whether
the
restrictions
that
i
hear
imposed
are
not
in
the
light
of
what
the
court
has
said
in
kent
and
in
aptheker
the
very
antithesis
of
an
open
society.
and
the
fact
that
in
the
present
case,
this
restriction
is
limited
to
travel
with
its
effect
upon
what
is
--
knowing
what
is
happening
elsewhere
means
that
logically
speaking,
if
a
government
is
right,
there
could
be
other
kinds
of
restrictions
upon
freedom
of
speech
and
association
because
we
have
entered
into
an
agreement
with
our
neighbors
below
to
do
the
same
and
we
don't
want
the
fault
in
our
part
of
the
agreement.
why
if
the
government
is
right?can
the
government
not
prohibit
public
meetings
on
the
subject
of
cuba?
there
are
logical
reasons,
provided
that
we
have
entered
into
an
agreement
with
the
foreign
ministers
of
latin
american
countries
that
they
should
do
the
same
because
we'll
never
be
able
to
persuade
them
to
do
it,
unless
they
do
it
as
a
matter
of
natural
art,
nothing
terribly
democratic
if
we
don't
do
it.
same
with
public
meetings,
same
with
writing,
all
of
these
things
which
are
more
clearly
things
which
have
an
effect
on
freedom
of
speech,
but
it's
still
part
of
the
same
genre.
it
can
be
excused
by
the
very
practical
argument
made
by
the
solicitor
general
in
this
case.
now,
i
think
this
business
of
using
an
american
as
an
instrument,
a
pawn,
has
been
said
in
congressional
committee
hearings
and
now
analyzing
the
government's
argument
here,
a
pawn
to
persuade
other
countries
to
restrict
the
rights
of
their
citizens,
which
may
be
permissible
under
their
constitution
or
statues,
although
i
haven't
seen
that,
is
simply
an
unrealistic
thing
and
unjustifiable
thing
and
violates
the
first
amendment.
the
entire
argument
made
by
the
government
with
respect
to
a
whole
history
of
restrictions
will
have
to
be
analyzed
by
the
court
as
it
reads
the
briefs,
but
i
can
assure
the
court
that
the
examples
of
restrictions
if
they
exist
at
all
and
if
they
aren't
statutory
ones,
restrictions
which
are
not
prohibitions
upon
travel.
the
whole
period
of
1930s
was
a
period
in
which
there
was
no
restriction
upon
travel
to
another
country.
we
think
that
it
is
only
by
overruling
what
the
court
said
in
kent
against
dulles
that
the
court
can
agree
that
the
act
of
18
--
or
the
act
of
1926
must
now
be
read
against
discretion
to
the
secretary.
it
is
only
by
overruling
what
the
court
said
there
that
we
can
bring
in
somehow
the
act
of
1952
to
rationalize
the
secretary's
action.
because
if
the
court
will
reread
the
government's
brief
in
kent
against
grail
(ph),
it
will
see
exactly
the
same
kind
of
argument,
more
sophisticated
now
because
we
all
learned
after
five
or
six
years,
but
exactly
the
same
kind
of
argument
and
the
impact
upon
foreign
affairs
because
in
kent
against
grail
(ph),
the
argument
made
by
the
government
was
if
you
let
these
communists
travel
abroad,
they
will
get
into
trouble
and
implicate
the
united
states,
and
this
will
affect
our
foreign
relations.
it
was
worse
there
as
a
matter
of
fact
because
it
also
involved
espionage
and
other
crimes.
but
the
foreign
relation's
argument
now
minimized
by
the
government
as
it
was
in
kent
was
very
vital
to
the
government's
position
in
kent.
and
we
must
remember
in
the
present
case,
in
answer
to
the
inquiry
by
mr.
justice
black
as
to
the
emergency
that
we
have
lived
in
the
united
states
since
1941
under
a
declaration
of
one
emergency
or
another
which
has
made
a
passport
a
legal
requirement
for
exodus
from
the
united
states.
at
the
1941
statute
was
passed
in
an
amended
form
at
the
insistence
of
senator
taft
who
realized
the
danger
of
changing
the
1918
statute
which
dealt
with
war
alone
to
war
or
national
emergency,
and
to
insist
it
on
the
floor
of
congress
supported
by
senator
la
follette
and
others,
it
was
successful
in
having
the
statute
of
1941
read,
war
or
the
national
emergency
existing
declared
by
the
president
in
may
of
1941,
and
that
was
a
war,
and
that
is
a
situation
which
much
greater
rights
could
be
attributed
to
the
government.
then
in
1952,
a
period
with
which
we're
all
acquainted,
we
found
ourselves
with
senator
taft
and
other
people
who
are
no
longer
here
and
the
word
“national
emergency
of
may
1941”
became
any
national
emergency.
well,
what
national
emergency
are
we
living
in
today
that
congress
was
interested
at
all?
today,
we
are
living
--
this
(inaudible)
--
the
statute
is
implemented
by
a
national
emergency
declared
by
the
president
that
exists
with
respect
to
the
korean
war
in
december
1950
and
was
implemented
in
january
1953
by
proclamation
3004.
the
president
has
not
placed
any
limitation
upon
travel
to
cuba
any
more
than
the
congress
has.
there
is
no
executive
order,
no
proclamation
that
says
that
the
korean
war
which
i
thought
had
passed.
the
korean
war
is
a
justification
for
the
ban
on
travel
to
cuba
for
foreign
relations
reason
or
otherwise.
the
president
made
a
proclamation
in
january
of
1953
with
respect
to
the
korean
war.
and
today,
because
no
one
has
wiped
out
the
proclamation,
the
secretary
himself
was
the
one
through
an
undersecretary
of
state
who
in
january
in
1961
said,
“this
korean
war
emergency,
which
still
prevailed,
is
a
justification
for
preventing
travel
to
cuba.”
now,
i
submit
that
is
quite
a
strain
on
an
emergency
declaration
in
the
far
east
to
have
it
apply
here
for
travel
to
cuba
upon
a
cabinet
official's
determination.
well,
i
have
the
highest
regard
for
cabinet
official's
determination.
i
do
not
think
that
they
should
be
permitted
to
restrain
and
impair
the
right
of
an
american
citizen
to
travel
particularly
where
that
right
is
so
intertwined
with
what
may
be
the
determining
factors
in
war
and
peace
in
this
world,
so
in
foreign
relations,
the
ability
of
the
citizen
to
know
something
for
himself
and
not
depend
upon
government
sources
or
upon
the
press.
i
thank
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
because
in
1926
statute
merely
says
that
the
secretary
of
state
may
issue
passports
subject
to
rules
and
regulations
of
the
president
and
no
other
person
may
do
so.
and
it
does
not
say
that
the
secretary
of
state
can
decide
either
in
connection
with
the
issuance
of
passports
or
otherwise
that
an
american
citizen
may
not
travel
to
a
particular
country.
in
1926
when
that
statute
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
and
no
other
person
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
and
i
think
that
has
a
relationship
only
in
this
sense
that
if
you
can
construe
that
statute
all
to
relate
to
travel
bans,
which
i
do
not,
then
it
would
mean
that
the
president
should
determine
when
a
travel
ban
is
appropriate
and
not
the
secretary
of
state.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
oh,
i
have.
oh,
yes.
i
objected
to
the
act
of
1926
as
completely
invalid
because
it
has
not
standards.
i
don't
want
to
have
the
court
misunderstand
me
on
that.
i
have
challenged
that
act
in
the
complaint
and
in
my
brief
and
in
the
argument
on
the
ground
that
it
has
no
standings.
and
i
thought
that
that
was
a
reason
that
drew
this
court's
opinion
in
kent
where
it
said
in
construing
the
act
of
1926,
we
have
to
bear
in
mind
that
where
the
curtailment
of
a
citizen's
liberties
are
involved,
the
absence
of
standards
citing
panama
refining,
etcetera,
is
an
important
factor.
and
the
court
then
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
act
of
1926,
the
act
relied
upon
by
the
government
here
did
not
authorize
despite
the
use
of
the
word
“may”
the
imposition
of
restrictions
upon
travel
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
executive
order
which
implemented
the
act
of
1926
gave
discretion
to
the
secretary.
this
court
disregarded
for
constitutional
reasons
the
discretion
given
to
the
secretary
by
the
president
in
executive
order
7856
of
1938,
and
we
suggest
that
there
is
no
reason
at
all
that's
been
offered
here
that
come
to
a
different
conclusion.
and
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
wealth
of
argument
made
by
the
government
in
its
citations
in
kent
was
far
more
persuasive,
although
we
did
not
think
it
was
persuasive
of
course,
but
far
more
persuasive
than
the
arguments
made
here
that
we
must
screen
our
american
citizens
from
other
countries.
thank
you,
your
honor.
