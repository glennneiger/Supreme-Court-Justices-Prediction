mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
shall
deal
first
with
the
jurisdiction
in
the
conventional
manner
and
then
with
the
merits.
we
submit
that
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction
of
this
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court
because
a
three-judge
district
court
was
not
required
in
substance
because
the
appellants
are
seeking
only
an
injunction
against
what
they
complain
--
against
what
they
alleged
is
the
misconduct
of
an
executive
official
and
not
against
the
enforcement
of
a
statute.
a
direct
appeal
of
course
lies
to
this
court
only
when
a
three-judge
district
court
is
required.
in
section
2282
of
title
28
requires
a
three-judge
district
court
only
where
the
plaintiff
seeks
an
injunction
restraining
the
enforcement
operation
or
execution
of
an
act
of
congress
or
repugnance
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
statute
does
not
speak
of
request
for
injunctions
restraining
the
allegedly
unconstitutional
execution
of
some
permissive
policy
and
i
may
say
i'm
not
distinguishing
between
a
statute
on
its
face
and
the
statute
as
applied,
of
course,
there's
nothing
to
that.
what
i'm
distinguishing
is
a
statute
that
directs
an
executive
or
administrative
official
to
do
something.
where
of
course,
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
that
statute
comes
under
section
2282
and
a
bill
which
seeks
simply
to
enjoin
an
executive
or
administrative
official
for
doing
something
that
he
may
do
of
which
--
or
may
not
do,
which
we
submit
most
clearly
does
not
come
within
the
statute.
now
it's
important
to
note
that
at
the
time
section
2282
was
enacted,
congress
had
before
it
the
example
of
section
2281,
the
immediately
preceding
section,
which
requires
a
three-judge
court
for
the
issuance
of
injunctions
in
the
case
of
state
action
against
where
the
injunction
would
enjoin
the
operation
and
execution
or
enforcement
of
(1),
any
state
statutes,
and
(2),
the
order
of
any
state
board
or
commission
acting
under
a
state
statute.
and
the
second
part
was
added
separately
by
amendment.
but
both
parts
were
there
at
the
time
when
section
2282
was
enacted.
and
when
congress
enacted
section
28
--
and
when
congress
enacted
section
2282,
it
followed
the
first
part
and
it
did
not
follow
the
second
part,
thus
indicating
that
it
drew
a
deliberate
distinction
between
enjoining
the
enforcement
of
statutes
and
enjoining
the
enforcement
of
orders
entered
by
officials
who
have
been
delegated
a
--
what
i
call
a
discretionary
powers,
some
power
of
choice
under
a
statute.
now
appellant
says
that
here,
he
seeks
to
restrain
the
appellees
from
carrying
out
the
passport
act
of
1926
and
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952.
but
when
one
looks
below
the
surface
of
the
formal
request,
it
becomes
perfectly
clear
that
the
thrust
of
the
requested
relief
is
directed
entirely
at
the
orders
and
conduct
of
the
secretary
of
state.
appellant
says,
he
wants
to
go
to
cuba.
there's
not
a
word
in
the
statute
that
prohibits
everybody
from
going
to
cuba
or
that
prohibits
appellant
for
going
to
cuba
in
that
manner.
not
a
word
in
the
statute
directs
the
president
or
the
secretary
of
state
to
forbid
travel
to
cuba.
if
the
secretary
had
not
chosen
to
change
the
regulations
for
reasons
i'll
explain,
and
to
deny
the
appellant
a
passport
in
common
with
others
then
of
course,
there
would
be
no
claim
here
at
all.
it
was
the
result
of
the
secretary's
choice.
and
what
is
more,
the
appellant
would
secure
complete
relief
if
you
are
entitled
to
it,
through
an
injunction
against
the
secretary's
discretionary
action
if
any
relief
were
warranted.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
not.
i
would
think
there
was
one
qualification
that
i
perhaps
should
note
to
that.
i
was
going
to
mention
it
later
but
it
--
perhaps
comes
in
better
now.
there
are
cases,
chiefly
allen
against
grand
central
aircraft,
that
might
be
thought
to
say
that
if
the
whole
statute,
the
whole
thing
is
attacked
on
some
ground
that
would
invalidate
it
entirely.
then
even
though
it
has
no
bite
until
an
executive
official
or
administrative
officer
has
decided
to
apply
it
in
a
given
way
that
that
is
within
section
2282.
in
allen
against
grand
central
aircraft,
the
question
wasn't
raised
of
both
sides
were
invoking
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
and
i
know
of
no
case
squarely
on
the
point.
but
so
here
if
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
was
just
going
to
say
that
it
would
seem
to
me
that
insofar,
as
the
appellant
is
attacking
the
whole
statutes
as
an
invalid
delegation.
that
if
what
was
done
in
allen
against
grand
central
aircraft
was
proper
that
in
this
case,
then
there
probably
is
jurisdiction.
as
to
that,
i
say
only
that
his
attack
of
that
kind
is
we
think
frivolous
that
--
and
that
therefore,
this
case
on
that
point
as
on
the
other
point
as
i
will
explain
in
a
moment,
is
one
where
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
this
court.
now
the
arguments
that
they'd
attack
is
frivolous
mr.
justice
white
of
course,
it's
more
convenient
to
develop
when
one
comes
to
the
substance
of
the
constitutional
question.
but
if
you
think
it
isn't
frivolous
then
even
though
he
is
wrong
on
that,
but
allen
would
tend
to
support
it.
and
i
acknowledge
that.
i'm
assuming
for
present
purposes
in
other
words,
that
it
is
frivolous
on
that
but
that's
not
a
substantial
question
that
if
he
raises
any
substantial
questions
in
this
argument
under
the
fifth
amendment
and
as
to
those
we
say,
that
he
is
attacking
only
the
order
and
not
the
statute.
now
on
both
points,
this
case
is
very
like
william
jameson
and
company
against
morgenthau.
the
case
had
two
branches
as
it's
very
clear
if
you
go
and
look
at
the
original
jurisdictional
papers
and
they
throw
a
great
deal
of
laid
on
the
opinion.
first,
the
plaintiff's
alleged
that
--
first,
the
plaintiff
has
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
entire
statute
on
the
ground
that
the
federal
alcohol
administration
act
invaded
the
powers
of
the
states
because
under
the
fourteenth
--
under
the
twenty-first
amendment,
the
federal
government
had
no
power
to
regulate
even
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
in
the
intoxicating
liquids.
a
three-judge
court
was
summoned,
an
appeal
was
taken
here
by
william
jameson
and
company
and
it
was
held
as
to
that
question
that
the
unconstitutional
argument
was
frivolous
and
that
therefore
a
three-judge
court
was
not
required
and
that
this
court
had
no
jurisdiction.
now
there
was
a
second
part
to
the
case.
the
plaintiff's
argued
in
the
--
alleged
in
the
second
branch
of
their
complaint,
that
the
orders
issued
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
violated
the
fifth
amendment
for
a
series
of
reasons.
he
said,
they
delegated
power
to
the
government
to
the
united
kingdom
that
they
setup
improper
classifications
and
so
forth.
and
he
alleged
that
those
orders
violated
the
fifth
amendment
and
that
in
addition,
if
the
statute
authorized
those
orders,
then
the
statute
was
to
that
extent
unconstitutional.
and
this
court
nevertheless
refused
to
consider
the
constitutional
issues
raised
by
the
challenge
to
the
orders
on
the
ground
that
they
were
only
a
challenge
to
the
order
and
not
a
challenge
to
the
statute
itself.
now
we
say,
we
like
in
the
delegation
of
power
part
of
the
case
to
the
first
branch
and
the
attack
upon
the
so-called
area
restrictions
to
the
second
branch,
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
jameson
case
is
therefore
controlling
here.
i
would
just
add
two
other
thoughts.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
distinction
we
draw
comports
entirely
with
what
is
the
practical
sense
of
policy
if
you
will,
of
the
statute.
ordinarily,
it's
not
true
in
this
case,
but
ordinarily
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
an
executive
or
administrative
regulation,
does
not
put
the
judge
who
issues
the
injunction
in
conflict,
in
opposition
if
you
will,
to
another
branch
of
the
government
in
a
sort
of
its
highest
capacity.
the
statute
relates
to
the
case
where
a
single
judge
is
asked
to
set
aside
something
that
congress
has
done.
that
is
not
true
or
it's
an
order
of
the
food
and
drug
administration,
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
dealing
with
the
regulation
of
liquor
or
something
like
that.
in
this
case,
we
think
that
it
does
but
the
court
in
opposition
to
the
executive
branch
in
its
most
important
function
and
we
labor
a
great
stress
upon
the
importance
of
this
question
here.
but
that
would
not
be
the
ordinary
situation.
now,
the
second
reason
like
this
accord
with
common
sense
is
that
if
the
appellant's
argument
as
i
understand
it
were
adopted,
it
would
not
only
put
an
exceedingly
heavy
burden
upon
the
federal
judiciary
and
upon
this
court
but
it
would
also
really
mock
the
legislation.
for
what
mr.
boudin
says
in
his
brief
is,
that
in
kent
against
dulles,
we
didn't
say
we
contend
that
if
the
statute
authorizes
these
regulations,
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
we
just
said
the
regulations
are
unconstitutional
and
therefore,
a
one-judge
court
was
proper.
but
if
we
choose
to
put
in,
that
the
statute
if
it
authorizes
the
regulation
is
unconstitutional
just
as
the
regulations
are
unconstitutional,
then
we're
entitled
to
a
three-judge
court.
now
i
submit
when
you
think
about
it,
that
allegation
can
be
made
or
withheld
if
he
is
right
in
each
and
every
case
where
the
constitutionality
of
regulations
is
challenged
because
you
always
--
the
statute
authorizes
them
then
it
is
invalid
they
say
(inaudible)
--
or
you
can
leave
it
out
he
says
as
they
did
in
kent
and
dulles.
and
that
seems
to
us
to
be
a
--
not
only
inconvenient
but
thoroughly
improper
rule.
if
we
are
right
in
thinking
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
this
court,
then
the
proper
course
as
we
put
out
--
point
out
in
our
brief,
would
be
to
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
district
court,
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
to
enter
a
new
judgment
and
the
appellant
could
then
take
his
case
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
has
been
--
i
think
it
would
and
that
has
been
the
regular
course
in
cases
of
this
kind.
we've
collected
the
authorities
in
our
brief
and
we
would
think
that
was
the
right
thing
to
do.
too
much
time,
i
think
has
gone
by
for
him
to
note
the
direct
appeal.
but
this
is
--
and
of
course,
the
statute
for
transfer
unfortunately
doesn't
apply
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no.
that's
confined
i
think
to
criminal
appeals.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
judgment
i
think
is
then
simply
the
judgment
of
a
district
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
or
even
if
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
presume
your
honor
as
some
--
it
happens
in
a
few
districts,
the
three
of
them
could
be
considered
a
city
gone
bad
and
could
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
still
make
--
but
even
a
circuit,
there
may
be
a
technical
--
mr.
archibald
cox
(voice
overlap)
of
being
acted
whether
he
was
assigned.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
could.
there's
no
question
about
that.
well,
it
conceivably
if
--
i
think
it
would
be
proper
to
consider
all
three
of
them
as
sitting
in
the
district
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
but
i
haven't
looked
into
it
as
your
honor
can
see
by
my
expression
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
connecticut
i
think
is
a
single
district.
but
for
example,
in
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania,
the
court
occasionally
sits
en
banc
the
district
court,
used
to
at
least
and
i'm
suggesting
there
was
--
that
that's
the
way
it
could
be
considered
here
in
this
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
judge
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
they're
both
connecticut
judges.
yes,
they
were
both
connecticut
judges
and
judge
smith
is
a
judge
for
that
circuit
and
in
addition
from
connecticut.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
--
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
get
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes,
but
if
there
were
three
there
and
three
voted,
they
could
all
sit
in
the
district
court
without
2282
being
applicable.
i
turn
now
to
the
merits.
on
the
merits,
two
questions
of
law
are
raised.
first,
whether
the
secretary
has
been
given
the
authority
to
refuse
passports
good
for
a
particular
country.
when
the
consequence
of
his
refusal
maybe
to
prohibit
such
travel.
and
second,
whether
the
interdiction
of
travel
to
a
particular
country
under
the
existing
conditions,
violates
any
of
the
appellant's
constitutional
right.
in
analyzing
those
questions,
it
seems
to
me
in
the
utmost
importance
to
understand
that
the
secretary's
restrictions
upon
passports,
foreign
travel
to
cuba,
are
an
integral
and
important
part
of
the
conduct
of
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states.
this
is
not
a
case
like
kent
against
dulles.
the
withholding
of
passports
for
members
of
the
communist
party
because
of
the
nature
of
their
beliefs
and
associations,
had
little
or
no
relationship
to
foreign
policy.
it
was
aimed
not
at
--
intercourse
with
a
particular
country
because
of
the
state
of
international
relations.
but
at
a
class
of
american
citizens
regardless
of
the
country
to
which
they
wanted
to
travel,
regardless
of
the
state
of
our
relations
in
any
particular
part
of
the
world
and
regardless
of
the
purpose
of
their
visit.
now
here,
it's
quite
clear
that
this
restriction
is
not
aimed
at
any
particular
class
of
american
citizens,
it
applies
generally.
and
it's
not
an
effort
to
shut
people
up
in
the
country.
it
is
a
matter
of
fact
one
can
travel
almost
anywhere
in
the
world
today.
you
can't
go
to
cuba,
to
south
vietnam,
south
korea
and
perhaps
one
or
two
other
places.
but
there's
no
effort
to
forbid
people
to
live
--
to
leave
such
as
was
involved
in
kent
and
dulles,
always
mentioned
back
in
the
magna
carta
cited
in
kent
and
dulles.
and
the
real
difference
is
that
the
withholding
of
passports
to
travel
to
cuba
and
the
consequent
prohibition
upon
travel
to
that
area
not
only
results
from
the
state
of
our
international
relations
but
it
implements
an
international
program
of
isolating
castro's
cuba,
worked
out
in
consultation
and
cooperation
with
other
american
republic
in
a
joint
effort
to
promote
their
security
and
stability
and
to
promote
their
progress,
their
democratic
progress
as
open
societies
as
well
as
our
own.
i
recognized
that
the
policy
of
prohibiting
restrictions
--
of
restrictions
upon
travel
to
particular
areas
has
been
the
subject
of
some
debate
as
a
matter
of
policy.
perhaps,
it's
open
to
reasonable
debate
even
when
all
the
facts
are
understood
as
a
matter
of
policy.
but
i
do
submit
that
it
cannot
be
denied
that
this
restriction
is
in
truth
maintained
today
as
a
vital
part
of
our
foreign
policy
in
a
very
important
area
of
international
relation.
and
once
it
is
determined
that
it
is
that,
then
of
course
the
wisdom
of
the
policy
is
not
for
the
courts.
the
relationship
between
the
restriction
and
the
conduct
to
foreign
policy
is
easily
demonstrated.
the
restriction
is
maintained
primarily
for
two
reasons.
we've
mentioned
some
secondary
once
in
our
brief
and
the
primarily
too.
first
and
probably
least
important,
the
restriction
greatly
reduces
the
risk
of
incidence
in
cuba
involving
united
states
citizens.
in
the
early
days
of
the
castro
regime,
united
states
citizens
were
imprisoned,
harassed,
even
put
to
death.
under
present
conditions,
there
is
scant
possibility
--
well,
preventing
the
recurrence
of
those
incidences
through
normal
diplomatic
methods.
their
recurrence,
reflecting
the
inability
of
the
government
to
afford
such
protection
to
its
citizens
would
very
seriously
embarrass
our
government
in
securing
protections
for
american
citizens
in
other
parts
of
the
world
where
there
might
be
another
temptation
having
seen
what
happened
to
twist
the
lion's
tail.
even
more
important,
in
a
time
of
tension,
the
recurrence
of
incidence
involving
injury
to
the
person
or
the
killing
of
american
citizens
without
regress
or
security
against
repetition
could
also
quickly
set
in
motion
a
disastrous
international
chain
of
events.
today,
our
minds
are
focused
on
the
far
–
at
southeast
asia
but
we
are
to
remember
that
the
greatest
danger
of
the
nuclear
age,
perhaps
the
greatest
danger
to
our
security
in
all
our
history
was
precipitated
in
october
1962
by
castro's
cuba
backed
by
the
soviet
union.
second,
and
many
times
more
important,
the
refusal
of
passports
valid
for
cuba
is
a
vital
part
of
an
inter-american
program
permitting
the
threat
that
the
castro
regime
raises
to
the
security
of
american
republics
and
to
democratic
social
and
economic
progress
in
the
western
hemisphere
not
excluding
the
united
states.
cuba
is
attempting
to
overthrow
the
existing
government
by
infiltration,
violent
revolution,
subversion
and
all
kinds
of
other
method.
that's
not
only
the
conclusion
of
the
president
and
the
secretary
of
the
state
and
of
the
congress
in
this
country
but
it
is
the
conclusion
of
other
american
republics.
resolution
of
--
resolution
i
of
the
meeting
of
foreign
ministers
in
(inaudible)
declared,
the
ministers
have
been
able
to
verify
that
the
subversive
offensive
of
communist
governments,
their
agents
and
the
organizations
which
they
control
has
increased
in
intensity.
the
purpose
of
this
offense
--
of
this
offensive
is
the
destruction
of
democratic
institutions
and
the
establishment
of
totalitarian
dictatorship
at
the
subverts
--
of
continental
powers.
to
cite
just
a
single
example,
a
special
organization
of
american
states
investigating
committee,
found
that
the
shipment
of
arms
in
november
1963
to
venezuela
was
one
by
which
cuba
openly
intended
to
subvert
venezuelan
institutions
and
to
overthrow
the
democratic
government
of
venezuela
through
terrorism,
sabotage,
assault
and
guerilla
warfare,
i'm
quoting
from
the
finding
of
that
committee.
the
response
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
other
american
republic
has
been
to
isolate
cuba
and
thus
weaken
both
its
will
and
capacity
to
promote
subversion.
early
in
october
1962,
the
ministers
of
foreign
affairs
of
the
american
republics,
requested
the
counsel
of
the
o.a.s.
to
make
an
urgent
study
of
the
transfer
of
funds
in
american
republics
for
subversive
purposes
of
the
flow
of
subversive
propaganda
and
the
utilization
of
cuba
as
a
base
for
training
in
subversive
techniques.
after
that
study,
a
special
committee
noted
the
important
part
to
travel
plane
in
efforts
of
revolutionary
subversion
and
recommended
the
control
of
travel
to
cuba.
the
procedures
it
said,
should
include
measures
“to
prohibit
trips
to
cuba
as
a
general
rule”
and
to
limit
the
use
of
passports
or
other
travel
documents
by
means
of
an
inscription,
stating
that
they
are
not
valid
for
travel
to
cuba
and
to
penalize
as
a
violation
of
law
any
trip
not
authorized
by
the
terms
of
the
documents
themselves.
i
suggest
that
it
is
both
accurate
and
entirely
fair
to
characterize
this
suit
as
one
to
block
the
government
of
the
united
states
from
carrying
out
its
part
in
those
international
recommendations.
what
we
have
done
reads
almost
exactly
upon
the
recommendations
that
i
read.
we've
told
the
story
of
other
similar
inter-american
resolutions
in
our
brief.
there's
no
need
for
me
to
repeat
them
here.
i
would
merely
emphasize
once
again
that
these
resolutions
are
now
maintained
as
the
result
of
international
cooperation
with
other
nations
in
the
western
hemisphere.
the
importance
of
the
measures
in
restricting
castro's
efforts
of
subversion,
in
maintaining
the
stability
and
security
and
the
opportunities
for
progress
as
open
societies
of
the
other
american
republic
are
plain
enough.
in
the
first
part,
in
its
place,
the
--
this
kind
of
cutting
off
of
passports
for
a
particular
country,
apply
strong
diplomatic
pressure.
i
shall
point
out
later
the
number
of
instances
in
which
we
have
used
and
successfully
used
it
as
a
diplomatic
weapon.
second,
they
are
the
principle
means
for
preventing
the
subversion
that
i
mentioned.
third,
they
furnish
an
important
part
in
cutting
off
communication
in
the
transfer
of
funds
between
people
in
cuba
and
people
in
the
other
american
republic,
making
it
much
harder
for
men
to
go
to
cuba
for
the
purposes
of
indoctrination
and
training
in
subversive
technique
and
then
to
go
back
to
another
country
for
the
purposes
of
steering
up
revolution.
and
finally,
i
would
point
out
that
they
are
a
component
part
of
the
broader
policy
of
economic
isolation
for
of
course
travel
to
cuba
would
mean
the
expenditure
of
funds
there
and
that
would
furnish
cuba
with
foreign
exchange
which
would
be
quite
important
to
it.
now
it'll
be
said
that
these
arguments
hardly
apply
to
united
states
citizens.
whether
that
be
true
or
not,
i'm
advised
by
the
secretary
of
state
that
if
the
united
states
cease
to
participate
in
the
collective
effort
to
limit
travel
to
cuba,
other
american
republics
could
hardly
be
expected
to
apply
the
same
measures
to
their
citizens.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes,
yes.
what
would
happen
in
the
interim,
i
don't
know.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
my
argument
at
this
point
is
directed
to
emphasizing
that
this
is
through
–
an
important
part,
terribly
important
part
of
the
foreign
policy
of
united
states.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
essential
background
against
which
one
must
decide
whether
this
is
within
the
president
and
the
secretary
of
state's
authority
and
whether
it
is
constitutional.
and
i
intend
to
deal
expressly
with
those.
i
know
--
thought
of
simply
saying
this,
important
we
must
win.
but
i
think
to
understand
the
character
of
the
thing
we
are
dealing
with
is
terribly
important
in
determining
what
power
the
executive
has
and
of
course,
it's
also
important
on
the
constitutional
issue.
now
your
--
your
honors,
of
course
are
right
that
there
are
other
ways
of
acquiring
--
of
achieving
this
and
i
suppose
it
wouldn't
be
the
end
of
the
world.
also,
there
would
be
a
period
of
confusion
and
delay
if
it
were
held
that
we
don't
have
the
power
under
the
present
statute.
but,
i
shall
argue
that
because
of
the
characters
of
this
thing,
we
don't
need
any
statute
as
well
as
our
view
that
under
the
passport
act
of
1926,
we
do
have
the
power.
but
i'm
coming
on
to
those
points.
but
here,
all
i
wanted
to
emphasize
and
perhaps
i've
said
it
enough,
is
that,
if
the
united
states
to
withdraw
a
key
pin
of
supporting
a
structure
of
international
cooperation
would
be
withdrawn
and
there
would
be
a
very
great
likelihood
that
that
structure
built
up
and
maintained
in
consultation
with
other
american
republics
would
come
tumbling
down.
now
i
come
to
the
questions
of
law.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
believe
that
a
number
of
them
have
and
i
have
asked
for
example,
for
a
list
which
has
just
been
handed
to
me
of
the
countries
that
do
impose
area
restrictions
that
are
western
nations
contrary
to
mr.
boudin's
information.
the
state
department
tells
me
that
australia,
germany,
italy,
spain,
japan
and
the
philippines
all
have
such
authority.
i
note,
they
say,
such
authority
--
oh,
but
do
not
use
them.
no,
wait
a
minute.
excuse
me.
those
have
the
authority
and
do
use
them.
the
ones
that
have
the
authority
and
do
not
use
it
include
france,
the
united
kingdom
and
belgium
but
the
first
group
i
was
--
think
too
conscientiously
here
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i'll
add
to
your
honor
in
just
a
moment.
i
don't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
i
expect
to
know
in
a
very
few
second.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
was
under
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
impression
that
they
had
acted
on
the
basis
of
the
recommendations.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
i
understand
that
they
have
such
measures.
indeed,
a
letter
from
the
secretary
of
state
which
i
was
virtually
quoting
in
that
passage
because
i
didn't
want
to
overstate
it.
it
says,
that
they
could
not
be
expected
to
maintain
them
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
would
certainly
implies
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
i
am
told
that
some
countries
have
taken
such
steps
that
many
have
acted
that
the
response
is
still
imprudent
that
it
is
not
--
i
could
not
give
the
impression
that
everybody
had
done
this.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
you
wish
we'll
--
well,
i
suppose
i
send
a
letter
of
it
which
gave
accurate
information
on
this,
because
anything
i
should
say
now
would
be
(inaudible).
the
questions
here
simply
stated,
whether
the
president
and
the
secretary
of
state
are
authorized
to
enter
into
this
kind
of
common
effort
with
our
neighbors,
and
if
so,
whether
it
invades
any
of
the
appellant's
constitutional
rights.
our
argument
that
the
secretary
has
been
duly
authorized
to
restrict
travel
to
cuba
in
implementation
of
foreign
policy
proceeds
in
two
stages.
now,
i
don't
think
it's
been
quite
accurately
stated
yet.
first,
we
say
that
the
constitutional
power
of
the
president
over
foreign
affairs
and
the
century
old
passport
legislation
first
--
last
reenacted
as
the
passport
act
of
1926,
gives
the
secretary
authority
to
refuse
passports
for
particular
countries
and
to
restrict
the
countries
in
which
an
issued
passport
will
be
valid.
i'm
talking
now
about
discretion
in
the
issuance
and
terms
of
passports,
not
about
legal
prohibitions
upon
actual
travel
which
may
or
may
not
follow
from
the
refusal
or
issuance
of
the
passport.
in
other
words,
contrary
to
the
assumption
underlying
mr.
boudin's
brief
in
his
entire
oral
argument,
we
are
not
claiming
that
either
the
inherent
power
of
the
president
or
the
passport
act
of
1926
give
authority
by
themselves
to
prohibit
travel.
that
may
or
may
not
be
the
consequence.
it
simply
don't
say.
i
don't
know.
our
point
is
that
whatever
the
legal
consequences
of
the
refusal
of
a
passport
or
the
restriction
of
the
passports
may
have
been,
the
secretary
of
state
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
had
and
therefore
has
today
ample
authority
to
impose
area
restrictions
upon
the
issuance
of
passports
themselves.
second,
we
say
that
section
215
(b)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
following
earlier
legislation
accepted
the
power
of
the
secretary
over
passports
as
a
predicate
and
therefore
ratified
and
confirmed.
and
the
new
law
then
attached
to
the
secretary's
withholding
or
restriction
of
a
passport
pursuant
to
his
existing
authority
a
new
statutory
prohibition
upon
the
actual
travel.
and
so,
it
is
not
a
matter
of
picking
a
little
piece
here
and
picking
a
little
piece
there
and
saying
that
didn't
give
the
secretary
or
the
president
power.
this
is
a
single
structure
where
there's
much
unity
and
coherence
as
a
painting.
i
try
to
develop
these
two
points
separately.
together,
we
think
they
clearly
just
sustain
the
present
restrictions.
the
power
of
the
secretary
to
issue
or
restrict
passports
or
to
restrict
the
areas
for
which
passports
will
be
valid
as
an
adjunct
to
foreign
policy,
rest
we
think
upon
the
inherent
powers
of
the
executive
over
the
conduct
of
international
relations
and
upon
the
passport
act
of
1926.
it's
the
executive
after
all
who
must
safeguard
the
interests
of
those
who
travel
under
passports
and
perhaps
they
answer
to
other
countries
for
the
conduct
of
those
who
go
there.
in
international
law
and
diplomacy,
the
suspension
of
travel
to
a
particular
foreign
country
is
an
established
instrument
of
our
policy.
it's
the
executive
who
must
determine
when
to
apply
this
pressure.
it's
the
executive
who
must
determine
when
the
state
of
international
relations
is
so
tense
in
relation
to
a
particular
area
that
the
danger
of
incidence
might
fair
--
seriously
affect
our
national
interest,
not
even
the
issue
of
war
or
peace.
it's
the
executive
who
must
determine
whether
to
enter
into
the
kind
of
arrangements
with
other
foreign
nations
that
i've
described.
were
it
necessary
therefore,
we
would
argue
that
the
issuance,
refusal
or
restriction
of
passports
according
to
the
necessities
of
international
relation
but
not
for
other
reasons,
and
that's
in
kent
and
dulles,
the
other
reasons,
is
an
integral
part
of
the
executive's
constitutional
responsibility
for
foreign
affairs.
mr.
archibald
cox
to
travel,
we've
got
an
exact
statute,
the
act
of
1952.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
go
beyond
what
we
have
here.
i
don't
want
--
wish
to
--
i
don't
have
to
argue
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
that
the
executive
has
power
to
bar
the
travel.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
say
that
the
secretary
--
mr.
archibald
cox
from
1941
until
19
--
until
date,
there
has
been
a
consequent
restriction
upon
travel.
there
was
a
consequent
restriction
upon
travel
during
world
war
i.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
came
from
a
statute
enacted
in
1941
in
the
very
same
words
as
section
215
(b)
of
the
immigration
nationality
act
of
1952.
and
that
came
back
from
the
legislation
enacted
during
world
war
i.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
the
1918
law
was
ineffective
with
determination
of
hostility.
there
was
a
period
as
i
would
--
i'm
getting
ahead
of
myself
--
there
was
a
period
during
the
1930s
when
the
secretary
refused
to
issue
passports
to
certain
areas.
well,
one
effect
undoubtedly
of
his
doing
of
mr.
justice
white,
whether
it
was
a
legal
restriction
or
not,
would
be
to
induce
most
american
citizens
not
to
go
to
those
areas,
which
in
itself
would
be
a
very
important
thing.
whether
there
was
a
legal
restriction
or
not,
i
simply
don't
have
to
argue
here.
it
would
obviously
be
a
harder
case
than
this
one.
but
i
again
shrink
from
conceding
something
that
might
be
important
someday
in
the
future.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
the
essence
of
my
argument
as
i
tried
to
state
a
moment
ago
is
first,
that
speaking
in
terms
of
the
issuance
of
passports
and
the
refusal
to
issue
passports
for
particular
countries
or
restricting
countries
which
they
are
good
that
that
power
has
been
exercised
almost
without
interruption
under
the
inherent
powers
of
the
executive
and
the
passport
legislation
of
1926,
and
i
say
that
gives
power
to
withhold
the
passport
from
cuba
--
or
for
travel
to
cuba.
then
the
question
becomes,
well,
what
happens
if
the
man
goes
to
cuba
without
a
passport?
i
say
we
don't
need
to
inquire
what
would
happen
in
the
absence
of
the
act
of
1952
because
that
statute
did
two
things.
it
came
along.
it
was
enacted
in
the
light
of
this
prior
record.
it
assumes
that
somebody
has
the
power
to
grant
to
withhold
a
passport,
and
it
said
if
you
go
without
a
valid
passport,
then
you're
guilty
of
a
crime.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
there
would
be
some
ways
one
could,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
or
one
could
leave
with
a
passport
for
england
and
then
go
to
cuba.
whether
one
be
--
the
--
i
believe
that
most
of
the
transportation
companies
as
alleged
in
the
complaint,
would
make
it
impossible
for
you
to
go
straight
to
cuba,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
in
this
case
we
have
the
statute
and
i
acknowledge,
of
course.
i'm
not
suggesting
the
appellant
can
get
to
cuba.
we'll
keep
him
from
getting
there
if
we
can
i'm
quite
sure.
i
am
suggesting
that
there
is
no
need
to
inquire
into
what
would
be
the
effect
of
the
refusal
of
a
passport
in
the
absence
of
legislation
that
has
been
on
the
books
for
more
than
20
years
because
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
an
entirely
different
case,
one
that
i
don't
need
to
argue.
i
was
about
to
develop
at
a
little
more
length
our
thoughts
with
respect
to
passport
legislation,
which
dates
back
to
1856
and
was
last
reenacted
in
1926
the
words
of
the
act
of
1856
where
the
secretary
of
state
shall
be
authorized
to
grant
and
issue
passport.
the
present
version
enacted
in
1926
says
that
he
may
grant
and
issue
passports.
we
don't
contend
that
the
words
convey
unlimited
discretion.
obviously,
they
don't
under
kent
and
dulles.
but
neither
do
they
command
the
issuance
of
passports
under
any
and
all
circumstances.
indeed,
if
you
look
at
this
case
the
other
way
around
as
i
would
suppose
when
we
normally
look
at
a
lawsuit
and
say
where
does
the
appellant
get
the
right
to
a
passport,
which
is
what
he's
trying
to
get.
he
would
have
a
very
hard
time
maintaining
that
the
words
“may
grant
an
issue
of
passports”
gave
him
a
legal
right
to
have
a
passport
issued.
the
words
are
those
that
certainly,
read
in
their
context
and
in
the
area
of
foreign
policy
in
which
the
president
and
secretary
are
operating,
convey
a
discretion
to
make
decisions
according
to
the
needs
of
foreign
policy.
that's
their
natural
meaning,
the
meaning
that
make
sense.
furthermore,
remember
that
the
statute
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
think
then
an
answer
to
that
and
i
don't
want
to
go
too
far
on
this
because
i'm
willing
to
meet
on
his
own
ground.
i
was
just
trying
to
dramatize
this
matter,
whether
it's
discretionary
word.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
a
technical
answer
to
that
might
be
justice
stewart,
will
then
issue
a
challenge
from
the
statute,
but
he
still
has
no
right
given
to
him
to
get
a
passport.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
--
that
the
passport
means
something
more
than
simply
an
opportunity
to
get
out
of
the
united
states.
but
as
i
said,
we've
taken
the
cases
that
was
presented
and
it
was
simply
for
the
light
it
threw
on
the
meaning
of
these
words.
now,
another
thing
that
helps
throw
light
on
the
meaning
of
the
words
is
that
the
1926
act
goes
on
to
say
that
the
secretary
shall
exercise
the
delegated
power
under
such
rules
as
the
president
shall
designate
and
prescribe.
i
suggest
that
whatever
was
the
case
in
1856,
by
1956
you
didn't
put
on
the
president
the
duty
to
prescribe
rules
unless
you
were
really
dealing
with
something
of
substantial
importance
and
that
that
reference
is
another
straw
pointing
to
our
construction
of
the
act
of
1926.
that
would
seem
to
us
therefore
that
taking
the
1926
act
that
it
--
like
the
constitution,
thus
give
this
power
to
issue
or
not
issue,
to
restrict
or
not
restrict
passports
in
the
light
of
the
necessities
of
international
relation.
but
i
would
emphasize
that
it's
not
necessary
and
i
think
it's
unrealistic
for
us
to
pitch
our
case
upon
either
source
of
authority
standing
alone
even
though
either
standing
alone
might
be
sufficient.
the
law
just
isn't
so
artificial
as
to
require
the
executive
to
say,
“well,
i
stand
on
this
ground”
or
“i
stand
on
this
ground”
or
“i
assign
31%
of
my
case
over
here
and
69%
of
my
case
to
the
other
ground.”
these
are
things
that
have
grown
together
for
more
than
a
century.
the
inherent
executive
power
and
the
power
conferred
by
the
statute
of
course
when
the
executive
act
in
--
simply
acting
(inaudible)
--
but
not
confined
to
one
or
the
other.
and
we
do
think
that
a
sort
of
the
symbiotic
relationship
has
existed
and
that
that
has
been
confirmed
and
strengthened
by
executive
practice,
congressional
acquiescence
and
occasional
reenactment
of
the
statute.
the
first
statute
prohibiting
travel
enacted
during
the
latter
part
of
the
war
of
1812
assumed
that
somebody
had
the
power
to
grant
or
withhold
passports.
it
was
treated
as
an
instance
of
executive
power
because
there
was
no
legislation
given.
during
the
civil
war,
the
secretary
of
state
seward
restricted
travel
to
europe.
in
january
1915,
the
state
department
stopped
issuing
passports
for
use
in
belgium
because
of
the
famine
there.
i
point
out
that
that
was
an
area
restriction.
on
january
24,
1917,
the
president
issued
new
rules
under
this
legislation
which
very
greatly
restricted
the
issuance
of
passport
for
travel
abroad.
in
1919,
passports
were
--
for
unnecessary
travel
even
in
the
territory
of
our
former
allies
were
rarely
issued
because
of
the
conditions
existing
there.
no
passports
were
issued
for
travel
in
germany
or
austria
until
1922
in
july.
no
passports
for
russia
until
september
1923.
i
think
it's
fair
to
characterize
those
as
area
restrictions.
during
the
1930s,
area
restrictions
on
the
passports
were
imposed.
passports
were
not
issued
for
travel
to
ethiopia
in
1935
to
1936.
they
were
not
issued
for
travel
to
spain
following
the
outbreak
of
the
spanish
civil
war,
or
travel
to
china
after
august
1937.
in
september
1939,
it
was
a
very
general
tightening
up
of
the
issuance
of
passports
for
travel
to
europe,
of
course
because
of
the
outbreak
of
war
there
and
in
a
sense,
while
that
was
not
a
prohibition.
it
too
was
an
area
restriction
because
there
was
no
tightening
up
to
passports
for
australia
and
apparently
no
requirement
of
passports
in
countries
in
the
western
hemisphere.
that
tightening
up
occurred
shortly
after
the
president
has
issued
on
march
31,
1938,
a
new
executive
order
under
the
passport
act
of
1926,
and
i
think
its
terms
are
important.
one
section
provided
the
secretary
of
state
is
authorized
in
his
discretion
to
refuse
to
issue
a
passport,
to
restrict
a
passport
for
use
only
in
certain
countries,
to
restrict
it
against
use
in
certain
countries,
to
withdraw
or
cancel
a
passport
already
issued,
and
to
withdraw
a
passport
for
the
purpose
of
restricting
its
validity
or
use
in
certain
country.
i'd
like
to
pause
for
just
a
moment
at
this
stage
in
the
historical
story
to
note
how
matters
stood
in
june
1941
because
that
was
just
before
the
enactment
of
the
new
legislation.
the
passport
act
of
1926
upon
its
phase
appeared
to
confer
a
broad
range
of
discretion.
for
80
years,
the
executive
branch
acting
either
under
that
legislation
or
its
inherent
power
over
foreign
policy
had
imposed
area
restriction
when
the
occasion
seemed
to
warrant.
the
power
was
specifically
asserted
in
the
executive
order
of
1978,
explicitly
asserted
in
that
executive
order
that
i
just
read.
so
far,
it
appears
no
one
challenged
the
authority
of
the
executive
to
take
this
action.
the
congress
not
only
acquiesced
but
in
1926
before
some
of
the
incidents
i've
mentioned
and
after
others,
it
reenacted
the
general
passport
legislation,
uttering
no
criticism
of
what
had
been
done.
even
without
the
reenactment,
it
would
seem
that
the
consistent
administrative
interpretation
by
those
charged
with
executing
the
statute
would
be
entitled
to
the
very
greatest
way.
the
appellant
says
that
well,
maybe
there
was
discretion
to
impose
area
restrictions
upon
the
issuance
of
the
passbook,
but
even
though
you
couldn't
get
a
passport,
you
could
during
the
1930s
at
least
to
travel
abroad.
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
we're
not
concerned
at
this
point
in
our
argument
with
the
legal
consequences
of
the
refusal
to
passport.
all
i'm
concerned
with
showing
at
this
point
is
that
whatever
the
legal
consequences
may
have
been,
the
secretary
under
the
president
had
reargued
and
certainly
had
exercised
repeatedly
the
power
to
impose
area
restriction.
but
he's
done
that
right
up
to
june
1941,
some
were
even
enforced,
and
there
was
outstanding
at
that
time
an
executive
order
issued
only
in
march
1938
that
i
just
quoted,
claiming
the
authority
and
delegating
to
the
secretary
the
authority
to
impose
area
restrictions.
as
i
say,
it
was
in
1941
that
the
congress
enacted
an
act
reviving
the
statutory
restrictions
imposed
on
travel
without
a
passport
that
it
had
been
in
existence
during
world
war
i.
they
were
revived
for
such
time
as
the
united
states
should
be
at
war
or
for
the
duration
of
the
emergency
that
president
roosevelt
did
proclaimed
--
i
think
it
was
in
may
1941.
one
of
the
restrictions
that
was
revived
from
the
old
1917
or
1918
legislation
was
the
direct
precursor,
even
in
words,
that
the
provisions
later
reenacted
as
section
215
(b)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952.
the
prohibition
as
it
read
in
each
instance
as
revived
in
1941
interim,
it
shall,
except
as
otherwise
provided
by
the
president
subject
to
such
limitations
and
exceptions,
the
president
may
authorize
and
proscribe,
be
unlawful
for
any
citizen
of
the
united
states
to
depart
from
or
enter,
or
to
attempt
to
depart
from
or
enter,
the
united
states
unless
he
bears
a
valid
passbook.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
was
the
--
this
is
the
words
both
of
the
1952
statute
and
of
a
1917
or
1918
statute
that
was
revived
in
1941,
so
that
what
you
have
are
these
words
in
effect
from
june
of
1941
to
the
present
time,
and
they're
the
same
words
in
each
instant.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
said
the
restrictions
your
honor,
had
been
in
effect
from
then
to
the
present
time.
there
was
no
mentioned
of
when
they
should
be
in
effect
except
that
there
was
required
to
be
a
proclamation
by
the
president
or
a
state
of
war.
mr.
archibald
cox
a
proclamation
by
the
president
of
an
emergency,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
was
in
1941.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
under
the
1952
statute,
a
new
proclamation
was
issued
declaring
an
emergency
and
that
proclamation
is
in
effect
today.
mr.
archibald
cox
no
sir
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
not
at
all.
based
on
the
proclamation
issued
by
the
president
--
by
president
truman
under
the
1952
statute.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
and
it's
remained
in
effect.
so
our
purpose
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
changes,
yes.
i
would
--
if
i
may
answer,
your
honor,
i
would
rather
address
myself
to
that
question
because
you
might
equally
ask
it
--
about
the
1941
statute.
the
same
question
is
pertinent
but
i'd
like
to
keep
the
chronology
if
i
can
because
i
think
it
has
some
significance.
i
think
the
answer
to
you
honor's
question
is
this.
first,
that
the
statute
from
our
point
of
view
had
a
twofold
significance.
first,
it
did
impose
a
new
statutory
restriction
upon
travel
and
therefore
in
a
sense,
as
your
honor
said,
changes
the
consequences
of
the
withholding
of
passbook.
but
second,
despite
the
change
in
consequences,
i
submit
your
honor
that
the
1941
legislation
had
the
effect
to
ratify
in
confirming
the
power
of
the
president
and
the
secretary
to
impose
area
restrictions,
which
had
been
openly
asserted
and
exercised
through
the
1930s
and
was
unequivocally
asserted
in
the
executive
order
which
had
been
issued
in
1938.
now,
the
reason
i
say
that
with
some
confidence
is
this.
congress
was
legislating
in
the
area
of
travel.
it
obviously
by
its
silence
acquiesced
in
what
the
president
and
secretary
of
state
had
been
doing.
it
didn't
say,
now
we've
got
some
new
consequences
to
stop
it.
on
the
contrary,
what
did
it
do?
the
new
provisions
obviously
took
as
their
predicate
that
somebody
had
the
power
to
grant
or
withhold
passports.
unless
the
authority
existed
somewhat,
the
no
provision
was
either
inoperative
or
was
of
total
prohibition
upon
power.
well,
now
what
authority
can
the
congress
has
been
thinking
of?
i
suspect
that
it
can't
have
been
anything
other
than
the
authority
that
existed
either
by
virtue
of
the
inherent
power
or
the
act
of
1923
and
it
had
been
exercised
right
up
to
then
in
the
past.
that
must
have
been
what
congress
was
referring
to.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
and
that
may
call
upon
the
president
and
the
secretary
of
state
to
judge
the
wisdom
of
their
actions
as
a
policy
in
a
somewhat
more
serious
way.
but
it
still
seems
to
me
that
if
this
statute
refers
back
to
something,
it
must
refer
back
to
the
power
that
they've
been
exercising
all
along.
what
else
is
it?
mr.
archibald
cox
if
congress
--
the
constitutional
question
of
course
is
different.
the
constitutional
issue
of
course
is
different.
and
i
don't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
i
wouldn't
question
for
a
moment
your
honor
that
the
constitutional
question
was
different.
but
what
i
--
and
i'm
not
--
i
hope
i
will
have
time
to
direct
myself
to
that.
what
i
am
insisting
is
that
this
must
have
referred
back
to
the
power
that
they
had,
whatever
the
constitutional
consequences
might
be.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
now,
i
just
add
one
more
word.
our
case
doesn't
stop
there.
during
the
period
from
1941
to
1952,
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
president
repeatedly
imposed
area
restrictions.
we've
collected
them
in
our
brief.
i
don't
think
that
it
is
fair
at
all
to
say
that
when
a
restriction
was
imposed
on
travel
to
certain
iron
curtain
countries
since
1952
that
the
department
of
state
said
that
this
was
not
really
a
restriction
--
that
the
withholding
of
passports
was
not
really
a
restriction
on
travel.
what
it
said
was
that
you
can't
travel
unless
the
passport
is
specifically
endorsed
under
an
authority
of
the
secretary
of
state
as
being
valid
for
such
a
travel.
and
then
it
went
on
and
said
this
procedure
of
forbidding
travel
without
a
special
endorsement
and
of
giving
special
endorsements
in
the
appropriate
case
in
no
way
forbids
travel
to
the
area.
well
that's
true,
and
they
went
on
to
indicate
that
they
would
issue
some
passbook,
which
i
think
was
all
they
were
characterizing.
now,
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
justice
goldberg,
is
that
when
the
statute
was
reenacted
in
1952,
you
did
have
a
series
of
instances
in
which
the
president
and
secretary
of
state
had
continued
to
prohibit
travel
even
though
the
legal
consequence
was
to
make
leaving
the
country
an
offense.
now,
if
i
might
take
just
a
moment
to
address
myself
to
the
constitutional
question
and
to
leave
the
rest
to
our
brief.
in
the
thrust
of
the
appellant's
argument,
and
that's
the
only
one
that
i
have
time
to
deal
with,
the
strongest
argument
is
that
this
restriction
violates
the
fifth
amendment
because
he
says
freedom
to
travel
is
part
of
the
liberty
secured
by
the
fifth
amendment.
we
agree
of
course
that
freedom
to
travel
is
an
aspect
of
the
liberty
circumscribed
as
of
the
liberty
guaranteed
by
the
fifth
amendment
and
that
it
may
not
be
curtailed
without
due
process
of
law.
even
if
we
didn't
subscribe
to
that
wholeheartedly,
we'd
be
compelled
by
your
honor's
decision
in
aptheker,
but
we
do
subscribe
to
it
wholeheartedly.
but
like
other
freedoms,
the
freedoms
to
own
or
use
property
and
the
freedom
to
choose
where
you
put
your
house
on
your
lot,
to
choose
what
kind
of
shaded
trees
or
decorative
trees
you
will
have,
like
the
freedom
to
engage
in
a
profession
or
the
freedom
to
engage
in
a
trade
or
business,
the
freedom
to
choose
the
(inaudible)
--
one's
patrons
or
employees.
this
freedom
we
submit
is
subject
to
reasonable
restriction
when
required
by
pressing
national
interest.
no
one
would
suggest,
i
take
it,
that
one
has
a
right
to
travel
to
an
area
ravaged
by
fire
or
disease
or
flood.
i
think
of
the
area
on
the
pacific
coast
ravaged
by
floods
just
before
i
was
first
preparing
this
argument.
and
that
it
would
be
said
that
a
restriction
on
travel
to
those
areas
was
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
now
here,
the
challenge
to
restriction
covers
a
very
narrow
area,
cuba.
even
when
it's
coupled
with
the
other
restrictions
the
state
department
has,
is
not
an
issue
here.
it
still
applies
only
to
a
narrow
area.
it's
applied
even
handedly.
it
involves
no
inquiry
in
the
beliefs
or
associations
or
even
activities.
it
arouses
no
--
may
i
have
one
or
two
words
more?
mr.
archibald
cox
it
is
made
--
it
involves
no
danger
of
hostile
or
invidious
discrimination.
it's
maintained,
it's
been
worked
out
and
it's
being
maintained
and
implemented
in
cooperation
with
other
american
republic
as
an
essential
measure
for
reducing
the
danger
of
subversive
attack
by
the
castro
regime
upon
the
latin
american
countries
who
are
our
friends
and
neighbors,
and
perhaps
ultimately
upon
the
united
states.
that
the
urgency
of
that
kind
of
cooperation
and
prophylactic
measure
short
of
war
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
i
mentioned
earlier,
that
the
untied
states
from
the
castro
regime
backed
by
soviet
russia
have
already
stood
at
least
once
in
a
frightening
confrontation.
in
the
end
inevitably,
since
freedom
to
travel
is
not
absolute,
the
whole
question
is
where
the
balance
lies.
now,
i
submit
that
in
this
instance,
great
weight
must
be
given
to
the
determinations
of
those
who
are
charged
with
responsibility
of
--
for
international
relations.
we've
cited
other
cases
on
our
brief
but
i
don't
want
to
delay
to
argue
the
point
at
any
length,
but
i
do
submit
this
that
a
nation
which
can
conscript
its
citizens
for
services
of
the
armed
forces
for
military
training
and
service
in
times
like
these
that
can
compel
a
conscript
to
travel
to
south
vietnam
or
other
places
far
from
home
in
a
time
of
national
emergency
cannot
be
powerless
during
that
same
period
to
forbid
citizens
to
travel
in
particular
reasons,
for
like
reasons
essential
to
the
national
safety
and
in
times
of
national
emergency.
mr.
archibald
cox
thank
you.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
find
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
find
the
authority
to
refuse
to
issue
passports
good
for
cuba
under
two
sources
which
have
historically
evolved
together,
the
inherent
powers
of
the
executive
over
the
conduct
to
better
national
relations
and
the
act
of
1926.
it
said,
the
importance
of
the
act
of
1952
is
that
it
took
that
authority
as
its
predicate
and
by
not
objecting
in
a
sense
ratified
it
and
that
then
what
it
does
is
say
if
you
don't
have
a
passport,
you
may
not
leave
the
united
states.
so,
that
i
think
these
things
are
built
on
each
other
like
bricks
that
you
can't
say
--
we
don't
say
the
whole
case
is
in
any
one
of
them.
we
say
that
the
discretion
comes
from
the
constitutional
power
of
the
1926
statute
that
the
prohibition
upon
to
travel
a
criminal
offense
comes
from
the
1952
statute.
but
we
say
that
this
has
grown
over
the
years
together
and
that
congress,
by
enacting
these
successive
statutes
has
ratified
and
approved
the
conduct
of
the
executive
in
question.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
said
the
authority
over
the
passport
since
1926,
the
prohibition
on
the
travel
which
follows
from
the
denial
of
a
passport
is
1952,
and
i
need
both
of
them
to
win
this
case.
