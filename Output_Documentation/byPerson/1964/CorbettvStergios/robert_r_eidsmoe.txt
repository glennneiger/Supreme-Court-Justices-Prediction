mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
iowa
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c.,
section
1257(2).
the
question
presented
here
is
rather
narrowly
defined
and
is
whether
or
not
the
treaty
of
friendship,
commerce
and
navigation
between
the
united
states
and
greece
nullifies
the
requirement
of
section
567.8
of
the
court
of
iowa
that
the
appellant
here,
a
non-resident
greek
alien,
proved
the
existence
of
a
reciprocal
right
to
succession
before
he
can
acquire
interest
in
iowa
property
by
succession
from
his
adopting
father.
briefly,
the
facts
in
this
case
are
that
back
in
1950
or
1946,
the
appellee
here,
then
a
young
lady
of
approximately
18
years
married
one
nicholas
stergios,
then
approximately
54
years
of
age
and
in
1954,
nicholas
stergios
executed
a
will
wherein
he
left
the
bulk
of
his
property
to
his
wife
and
some
other
property
to
what
is
indicated
to
be
a
niece
ward.
no
mention
was
made
in
that
will
of
any
provision
for
children
or
any
mention
made
with
regard
to
children
at
all.
no
children
were
born
of
this
marriage
between
the
appellee
and
nicholas
stergios
and
then
in
1956
and
1957,
discussion
was
had
between
the
married
couple
about
the
desirability
of
adopting
a
child.
proceedings
were
commenced
in
a
court
in
greece
to
adopt
the
young
child
there,
which
culminated
in
a
decree
in
a
greek
court
in
february
1958
whereby
the
appellant's
ward
here
was
adopted
by
nicholas
stergios.
nick
stergios
became
ill
shortly
after
the
adoption
decree
and
died
in
august
1958.
the
minor
child
was
never
brought
over
to
this
country,
mr.
stergios’
estate
was
probated
and
closed
in
march
1959.
early
in
1961,
this
guardianship
wherein
stanley
corbett
became
the
guardian
of
constantine
neonakis
was
established
and
a
suit
was
commenced
in
the
district
court
of
iowa
in
woodbury
county
to
reopen
the
estate,
set
aside
the
probate
proceedings,
have
a
new
administrator
appointed,
and
to
have
--
to
allow
the
child
to
recover
two-thirds
of
the
estate.
under
iowa
law
an
after-born
child
who
is
not
mentioned
in
a
will
is
entitled
to
recover
a
child’s
intestate
share,
which
in
iowa
is
two-thirds
of
the
estate.
the
trial
was
had
in
july
of
1962
wherein
the
appellant
contended
that
the
child
had
been
legally
and
validly
adopted
in
the
greek
courts
and
that
by
virtue
of
section
633.13
of
the
court
of
iowa
the
child
was
entitled
to
a
child's
intestate
share.
in
the
proceedings
in
the
iowa
court,
there
came
at
a
question
then
whether
or
not
the
child
was
entitled
to
inherit,
because
of
the
provisions
of
iowa
code
section
567.8,
which
states
that
a
non-resident
alien
cannot
take
title
to
real
estate
in
iowa,
unless
he
can
prove
the
existence
of
reciprocal
rights
to
succession
granted
to
american
citizens
in
his
country.
or
in
other
words
here,
the
greek
alien
could
not
inherit
iowa
property
unless
he
could
prove
that
american
citizens
in
greece
were
granted
a
reciprocal
right
to
inherit
property
in
greece
from
greeks.
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
the
iowa
code
section
applies
to
both
real
property
and
personal
property
your
honor.
it
was
contended
by
the
appellant
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
the
court
took
judicial
notice
of
the
treaty
of
friendship,
commerce
and
navigation
between
united
states
and
greece
and
as
i
say,
it
was
contended
by
the
appellant
that
the
provisions
of
this
treaty
nullified
the
requirements
of
the
iowa
code
section
requiring
proof
of
reciprocal
inheritance
rights.
the
trial
court
found
that
there
had
been
a
valid
adoption
in
the
greek
courts
by
nick
stergios
and
that
the
adoption
was
conclusive
on
the
iowa
court
and
that
there
had
been
no
fraud
in
the
procurement
of
the
adoption.
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
no
fraud
in
the
procurement
of
the
adoption,
that
had
been
one
ground
raised
by
the
defendant
there.
the
iowa
court
did
find
however
that
there
was
no
conflict
between
the
provisions
of
the
iowa
reciprocal
succession
statute
and
the
treaty
and
thereupon
dismissed
the
petition
of
the
appellant
herein.
appeal
was
taken
to
the
iowa
supreme
court
and
there
the
sole
question
raised
on
appeal
was
the
claimed
error
of
the
trial
court
in
holding
that
there
was
no
conflict
between
the
treaty
and
the
statute
and
again,
this
time
by
a
five
to
four
decision,
the
iowa
supreme
court
held
that
again
there
was
no
conflict
between
the
treaty
and
the
statute
and
held
that
the
trial
court
was
correct
in
dismissing
the
petition.
so
hence,
we're
in
this
court,
appealing
a
decision
of
the
iowa
supreme
court
and
we
get
down
to
the
basic
issue
in
the
case
whether
the
treaty
suspends
or
nullifies,
whichever
term
you
prefer,
the
requirements
of
section
567.8
of
the
iowa
code
that
the
appellant
must
prove
the
existence
of
reciprocal
succession
rights
in
order
to
enable
him
to
take
property
by
succession.
we
get
down
to
a
few
basic
principles
of
interpretation
of
treaty,
your
honor.
the
first,
of
course
that
the
treaties
--
treaty
power
is
supreme,
treaties
are
to
be
liberally
construed,
and
that
there
is
no
need
to
restrictively
interpret
treaties
in
order
to
avoid
any
conflicts
with
state
statutes.
now
without
regard
to
the
treaty
for
a
moment,
there
is
no
question
but
that
section
567.8
of
iowa
code
would
require
the
appellant
here
to
prove
the
existence
of
reciprocal
succession
rights,
in
other
words,
that
american
citizens
could
inherit
in
greece
to
the
same
extent
that
we're
claiming
rights
in
the
iowa
court.
this
is
without
regard
of
the
treaty,
and
the
burden
is
placed
upon
the
appellant
and/or
the
plaintiff,
the
claimant,
to
make
such
proof
as
a
matter
of
fact
of
the
greek
law.
this,
we
did
not
do,
but
chose
to
rely
upon
the
provisions
of
the
treaty,
which
we
felt
to
be
completely
in
conflict
with
the
iowa
statute.
now,
the
treaty
and
the
pertinent
part
of
the
treaty
is
article
ix
and
first
of
all,
section
1
of
article
ix
provides
that
nationals
of
the
united
states
and
greece
are
given
national
treatment
within
the
territory
of
the
other
to
acquire
land
and
other
immovable
property
subject
to
certain
limitations.
now,
the
first
limitation
applies
to
greek
nationals
claiming
property
in
the
united
states
and
section
8
says,
in
case
of
greek
nationals,
the
acquisition
of
property
rights
is
dependent
upon
state
law.
in
regard
to
u.s.
nationals
claiming
rights
in
greece,
the
right
to
acquire
is
subject
to
restrictions,
which
greece
may
place
upon
aliens
in
certain
frontier
and
coastal
areas,
which
i
suppose
is
for
the
purposes
of
national
defense.
now
so
far,
i
don't
believe
that
the
appellant
and
appellee
have
any
disagreement
as
to
the
meanings
of
the
treaty
down
to
this
particular
point.
and
i
don't
believe
there's
any
doubt
that
if
this
is
all
the
treaty
said,
we
would
have
to
prove
the
existence
of
the
reciprocal
succession
rights
and
we
did
not
do
so
and
the
trial
court
would
have
been
correct
in
dismissing
the
petition.
however,
all
important
we
feel
is
the
provision
set
out
in
the
next
article
of
the
treaty,
which
is
article
ii.
and
article
ii
provides
in
essence
where
the
alienage
of
a
national
of
either
party
prevents
him
from
receiving
national
treatment
in
acquiring
property
in
the
territory
of
the
other
by
succession,
he
shall
be
allowed
to
freely
dispose
of
the
property
within
a
period
of
5
years.
now,
i
haven't
quoted
it
exactly,
because
it
is
stated
a
little
bit
differently
in
that,
but
in
essence
this
is
what
the
section
provides.
and
so
--
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
i'm
sorry
section
2,
article
ix.
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
yes.
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
to
the
effect
of
section
2
of
article
ix.
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
yes.
this
is
correct.
section
567.8
would
specifically
require
that
there
be
proof
of
the
succession
rights
before
anything
was
required
as
the
courts,
which
wrote
the
opinion
in
the
proceedings
below
said,
either
you
prove
the
existence
of
reciprocal
rights
or
you
take
nothing.
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
this
is
correct.
of
course,
we
claim
the
right
to
dispose
comes
by
virtue
of
the
treaty.
we
think
that
appellant
contends
that
section
1
and
section
2
of
article
ix
of
the
treaty,
setup
a
definite
pattern
that
is
to
be
followed
and
a
definite
intent
on
the
part
of
the
drafters
of
the
treaty
that
it
was
recognized
that
states
have
placed
certain
restrictions
upon
the
rights
of
aliens
to
acquire
property
within
their
borders
and
that
this
is
partly
due
to
the
fact
that
states
have
always
zealously
guarded
their
right
to
determine
who
ultimately
holds
title
to
real
estate
within
their
borders.
on
the
other
hand,
you
have
the
conflicting
legal
principle
that
the
treaty
right
is
supreme
and
the
federal
government
must
protect
its
treaty
power.
and
so,
we
feel
that
the
plain
meaning
of
the
article
ix
of
the
treaty
is
that
states
--
while
states
may
restrict
the
right
of
greek
nationals
to
acquire
real
property
rights
and
personal
property
rights
in
their
state
that
the
right
of
greek
aliens
should
not
be
completely
cut
off
and
they
should
be
allowed
a
period
of
time
in
which
to
sell
the
property,
receive
the
market
value
of
it,
and
withdraw
the
proceeds,
thus,
striking
a
balance
between
the
right
estates
to
ultimately
determine
who
is
to
hold
title
in
their
property
and
prevent
a
forfeiture
of
an
inheritance
on
the
part
of
the
aliens.
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
yes.
this
of
course
is
correct
and
this
is
the
reasoning
for
trial
court
applied.
it
felt
that
the
section
2
here
of
article
ix
only
dealt
with
the
disposal
of
property
and
didn't'
deal
with
the
acquisition
of
it.
however,
i
think
that
the
plain
meaning
of
section
2
here
says
that,
it
specifically
states
nationals
and
companies
of
either
parities
shall
be
permitted
free
to
dispose
of
property
for
their
alienage
has
prevented
them
from
receiving
national
treatment
in
the
acquisition
of
it.
now
i
believe
there
isn't
anything
to
dispose,
if
you
don't
acquire
something
in
the
first
place,
and
i
believe
this
point
has
been
very
clearly
covered
by
this
court
in
the
case
of
clark
versus
allen,
interpreting
a
very
similar
treaty
between
united
states
and
germany
as
applied
to
a
california
statute,
which
i'm
sure
iowa
has
frankly
copied
verbatim
from,
and
it
held
and
the
iowa
courts
that
have
held
with
reference
to
previous
treaties
as
well,
other
treaties
that
where
you
have
this
power
of
sale
granted
in
a
treaty
this
in
itself
constitutes
the
grant
of
a
property
right
and
that
unless
there
is
some
right
granted
there
is
nothing
to
sell
at
all.
and
the
iowa
courts
and
i
believe
this
court
has
described
this
right
as
either
a
determinable
fee
or
a
limited
fee
of
some
type,
they
say
it
doesn't
make
much
difference
what
you
actually
call
it,
but
the
actual
grant
of
the
right
to
sell
covers
with
it
property
rights
so
that
it
can
be
disposed
of
within
the
period
of
time.
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
well,
i
suppose
you
could
take
that
meaning
your
honor.
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
well,
i
suppose
that
meaning
could
be
given
to
it.
however,
i
think
that
if
this
meaning
was
given
to
this
provision,
it
would
very
narrowly
limit
the
number
of
persons
who
would
ever
be
entitled
to
ever
acquire
any
rights
under
it
and
i
don't
believe
that
that
would
be
the
intent
of
the
whole
meaning
of
the
article
as
read
as
a
whole.
we
think
that
–
i
think
that
it
plainly
means
that
states
do
have
the
right
to
grant
certain
or
to
give
certain
limits
to
the
right
to
acquire,
but
where
they
do
so,
where
they
discriminate
against
aliens
and
aliens
because
of
their
alienage
are
not
given
national
treatment,
they
shall
be
given
the
right
to
dispose.
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
i'm
saying
the
states
can
discriminate
against
aliens
your
honor,
but
where
they
do
so,
the
aliens
must
given
the
period
of
5
years
to
dispose
of
the
property.
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
yes,
yes.
this
is
our
position.
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
this
is
our
position.
we
can
see
that
if
we
must
--
if
we
intend
to
take
a
fee
simple
or
absolute
to
this
property
that
we
must
have
proven
the
existence
of
reciprocal
successions
rights,
but
not
having
done
this,
we're
entitled
to
at
least
the
limited
fee
and
the
right
to
sell
the
property.
as
i
have
previously
stated,
we
think
that
this
case
clearly
comes
within
the
scope
of
the
case
of
clark
versus
allen
and,
which
was
decided
by
this
court
back
in
1947.
the
california
statute
is
absolutely
undistinguishable
from
the
iowa
statute.
the
provision
of
the
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
germany
with
regard
to
real
property,
it
cannot
be
distinguished
and
this
court
held
at
that
time,
that
the
california
law
or
requirement,
requiring
a
german
alien
to
prove
the
existence
of
reciprocal
succession
rights
under
the
california
statute
was
in
conflict
with
the
treaty
and
there
was
no
need
to
prove
the
existence
of
reciprocal
succession
rights.
now,
we
find
that
it's
quite
difficult
to
understand
the
reasoning
of
the
iowa
court
in
the
way
it
got
at
the
fact
that
there
is
still
the
necessity
of
proving
the
existence
of
reciprocal
succession
rights.
one
way
they
did
get
at,
was
that,
they
claimed
that
article
xxiv
and
specifically
section
1
to
some
extent
nullified
and
suspended
the
provisions
of
section
2
of
article
ix
upon
which
we
rely.
and
of
course,
article
xxiv,
section
1
simply
defines
the
meaning
of
the
term
“national
treatment”,
and
the
iowa
court
quoted
the
last
sentence
of
section
1
of
article
xxiv
and
it
stated,
“the
term
does
not
imply
immunity
from
the
laws
and
regulations
of
a
party,
which
apply
in
a
nondiscriminatory
manner
to
nationals
company's
products,
vessels
of
both
parties,”
but
it
left
out
the
portion
of
this
sentence,
which
says,
which
apply
in
a
nondiscriminatory
manner.
and
the
iowa
court
said
that,
well
if
national
treatment
doesn't
mean
that
the
parties
in
particular
here
in
this
case
greeks
are
freed
from
state
laws
or
that
the
section
567.8
must
apply.
however,
what
the
court
overlooked
and
left
out
of
its
quotation
of
this
sentence
was
the
term,
which
apply
in
a
nondiscriminatory
manner
and
of
course,
it's
our
contention
that
section
567.8
of
the
iowa
code
is
clearly
discriminatory
against
the
aliens.
it's
only
aliens
who
have
to
prove
the
existence
of
reciprocal
succession
rights
and
it's
because
of
their
alienage
that
in
this
case
an
added
burden
was
placed
upon
us,
which
we
could
or
could
not
have
met,
but
which
has
prevented
us
from
acquiring
title
to
the
property
and
two-thirds
of
the
estate.
so
while
regulations
and
laws
maybe
passed
by
a
state
in
the
manner
in
which
persons
acquire
property
within
their
borders
and
national
treatment
contemplates
this,
where
you
have
a
state
statute
that
applies
in
a
discriminatory
manner
and
prevents
an
alien,
because
of
his
alienage
from
acquiring
property
rights
in
the
state
section
2
of
article
ix
comes
into
play.
we
contend
that
in
this
case
we
have
not
been
allowed
to
acquire
and
receive
that
--
we
have
not
been
allowed
to
receive
property,
because
of
our
alienage.
by
reason
of
our
alienage,
we
have
not
been
able
to
receive
national
treatment
and
so,
under
the
provisions
of
section
2,
we
should
be
allowed
a
provision
or
a
period
of
5
years
to
dispose
of
the
property.
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
well,
your
honor,
the
section
2
of
article
ix
does
not
justify
to
real
estate.
it
says
property
and
i
would
assume
that
property
could
include
both
the
term
of
real
property
and
personal
property,
although,
i
will
concede
that
section
1
describes
only
interests
in
real
estate
and
immovable
property.
this
is
largely
a
moot
point
in
this
case,
because
the
personal
property
involved
is
of
infinitesimal
amount
involving
i
believe
a
1948
pontiac
automobile,
but
i
think
that
the
treaty
could
include
real
estate
and
personal
property
as
well
and
this
is
the
view
of
the
acting
deputy
attorney
for
the
state
department.
we
believe
here
that
on
familiar
principles
to
this
court,
the
interpretations
placed
upon
treaties
by
the
departments
of
the
government
that
are
charged
with
their
administration
are
highly
important
and
are
given
great
weight
by
the
court.
and
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
brief
submitted
by
the
solicitor
general
at
the
request
of
this
court
concerning
this
case
and
his
views
on
it.
and
particularly,
at
page
3
where
archibald
cox,
the
solicitor
general
states,
the
iowa
courts
have
held
that
state
laws
of
inheritance
maybe
applied,
so
as
to
defeat
the
right
of
a
nonresident
greek
national
to
take
by
succession
real
and
personal
property
located
within
the
state.
this
holding
depends
upon
a
construction
of
the
treaty
between
united
states
and
greece.
that
construction
in
view
of
both
the
department
of
state
and
the
greek
government
is
in
error
and
after
reviewing
two
or
three
opinions
from
other
attorneys
in
the
state
department,
all
conclude
that
by
virtue
of
the
treaty
between
united
states
and
greece,
there
is
no
burden
on
this
appellant
and
by
virtue
of
the
greek
treaty
to
prove
the
existence
of
reciprocal
succession
rights
to
acquire
property
interests
under
section
2
of
article
ix
of
the
treaty.
we
believe
that
this
view
should
be
given
great
weight
by
the
court
since
the
court
has
recognized
in
a
number
of
cases
that
the
view
of
the
state
department
should
be
given
great
weight.
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
one
letter
was
your
honor,
the
letter
from
abraham
chase
was.
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
they
were
not
made
available
to
the
iowa
court,
however,
because
of
course,
our
record
was
limited
as
to
the
proceedings
that
took
place
in
the
court
below
and
the
letter
was
not
made
a
part
of
the
record
and
the
trial
below,
because
it
took
place
afterwards.
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
no
one
again
attempted
to
prove
reciprocity.
that
there
was
no
attempt
to
do
so
although
--
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
yes,
your
honor.
he
says
it
is.
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
there
is
some
discussion
by
the
iowa
courts
your
honor
and
i
think
that
the
—
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
i
think
the
iowa
court
is
a
little
bit
confused
there
on
what
reciprocity
is.
here,
we're
trying
to
claim
a
greek
minor
inheriting
from
his
adopting
parent
and
the
iowa
law
there
would
apply
as
to
whether
he
could
or
could
not
and
the
reciprocity
would
be
in
greece
whether
the
comparable
situation
would
apply
--
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
could
inherit
from
a
greek
adopting
parent.
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
and
not
whether
the
parent
can
inherit
from
the
child
and
it's
our
position
that
the
court
just
got
confused
on
what
the
principle
of
reciprocity
means.
i
believe
that
the
confusion
of
the
iowa
court
can
be
summed
up
by
one
statement,
which
is
showing
the
opinion
of
the
iowa
supreme
court
on
page
48
of
its
record,
wherein
it
states
that
there
is
no
conflict
between
the
treaty
and
the
statute
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
is
a
question
of
fact.
and
this,
we
believe
would
be
a
startling
principle
of
constitutional
law
that
state
statutes
and
federal
treaties
were
in
conflict
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
not
as
a
matter
of
law.
we
feel
that
the
iowa
court
simply
did
not
understand
the
principle
of
the
workings
of
the
treaty
or
what
exactly
the
reciprocity
requirement
of
its
own
statute
was
and
for
this
reason,
we
feel
that
this
court
should
reverse
to
below
for
proceedings
not
consistent
with
your
opinion.
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
has
come
up
as
to
whether
clark
versus
allen
is
really
applicable
to
this
case
and
again,
all
i
can
reiterate
is
what
was
said
in
spite
of
the
appellee's
counsel's
comments
that
clark
versus
allen,
we
believe
stands
on
all
fours
of
this
case.
the
california
reciprocal
succession
statute
is
identical
to
the
iowa
statute
with
the
one
exception
that
the
california
statute
combines
the
words
real
and
personal
property
all
in
one
sentence
and
the
iowa
court
goes
through
the
whole
procedure
twice,
once
with
reference
to
real
property
and
the
other
time
with
reference
to
personal
property.
the
treaty
provision,
which
would
be
comparable
to
section
2
of
the
greek
treaty,
which
was
contained
in
the
german
treaty,
which
was
construed
in
the
clark
versus
allen
case.
while
the
language
is
slightly
different,
you
can
go
through
it
ten
times
then
you
can
come
up
with
the
same
conclusion
that
the
language
of
the
pertinent
treaty
provision
dealing
with
real
property
in
the
german
treaty
is
the
same
as
the
language
in
the
greek
treaty
and
so,
we
believe
that
this
case
should
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
principles
enunciated
in
clark
versus
allen.
that
there
is
no
need
by
virtue
of
this
treaty
provision
to
prove
the
existence
of
reciprocal
succession
rights.
the
question
has
come
up
is,
why
wasn't
reciprocal
succession
rights
proved
in
the
trial
court
and
i
suppose
there's
no
case
that
you
try
that
if
you
could
do
it
over
again,
you
wouldn't
do
something
a
little
bit
different
and
this
would
certainly
be
one
of
them.
however,
at
that
time,
it
was
simply
felt
that
the
treaty
was
so
clear
on
the
point
that
there
was
no
need
to
prove
the
existence
of
reciprocals
succession
rights
and
no
attempt
was
made
to
do
so.
had
we
had
an
opportunity
again
to
redo
the
record,
this
would
undoubtedly
be
done
and
this
problem
would
be
avoided,
but
we
believe
the
treaty
completely
covers
the
situation.
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
we
think
that
the
section
2
of
article
ix
clearly
provides
that
where
we
aren't
given
national
treatment
in
the
acquisition
of
property,
we
are
given
the
right
to
dispose
of
it
and
we're
given
the
limited
right
of
inheritance
or
a
limited
right
of
property
pursuant
to
section
2
of
article
ix.
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
no.
i
believe
article
ii
is
quite
clear
that
you
have
the
right
to
dispose
of
the
property
and
withdraw
the
proceeds
and
if
article
ii
doesn't
clearly
so
provide,
article
3
certainly
does,
where
it
provides
that
you
shall
be
given
national
treatment
with
respect
to
disposing
of
property
of
all
kinds,
but
it
provides
that
you
shall
be
given
5
years
to
dispose
of
the
property
and
this
can
only
mean
that
you
dispose
of
the
property
and
withdraw
the
proceeds
or
there
would
be
no
point
in
having
the
section
in.
mr.
robert
r.
eidsmoe
yes,
your
honor.
there
was
miscellaneous
bar
supplies
and
fixtures,
i
believe,
but
in
essence,
the
value
in
the
estate
does
constitute
real
estate.
now,
counsel
for
the
appellant
or
appellee
here
has
indicated
that
it
is
implicit
in
the
decision
of
the
trial
court
and
in
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
that
the
court
is
saying
that
it
should
not
--
it
is
not
recognizing
the
status
of
adoption
for
public
policy
reasons
or
whatever
reasons
it
might
have.
the
appellant
claims
that
this
is
flatly
not
the
case.
in
fact,
the
trial
court
definitely
stated
that
the
status
of
adoption
was
conclusive
on
the
iowa
court
and
that
there
had
been
no
--
that
the
only
reason
that
would
not
recognize
the
adoption
would
be
if
there
was
fraud
shown
and
it
said
that
after
examining
the
evidence
there
was
no
fraud
in
the
obtaining
of
the
decree
of
adoption.
and
so,
it
concluded
with
the
statement
that
the
status
of
adoption
was
conclusive
on
the
iowa
court
and
then
and
only
then
did
it
go
into
the
question
of
whether
section
567.8
conflicted
with
the
treaty.
we
think
again
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
case
of
clark
versus
allen,
that
the
intent
of
the
parties
who
negotiated
the
treaty
should
be
given
great
weight
and
i
would
again
call
the
attention
to
the
court
to
the
opinion
of
andreas
f.
lowenfeld
acting
legal
advisor
for
the
secretary
of
state,
which
is
contained
in
the
appendix
b
to
the
brief
submitted
by
the
solicitor
general
wherein
he
states,
the
department
of
state
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
treaty
eliminates
any
necessity
of
approving
reciprocity
of
treatment
where
the
property
in
question
is
realty
and
thus
subject
to
article
ix.
another
legal
advisor
for
the
department
of
state
as
i
indicated
says
that
he
believes
that
this
also
applies
to
personality,
but
at
least
where
there
is
realty
involved,
there
is
no
need
for
proving
reciprocity
of
treatment.
and
so
therefore,
we
feel
that
the
decision
of
the
iowa
supreme
court
should
be
reversed
in
this
case
remanded
to
lower
for
further
proceedings.
thank
you.
