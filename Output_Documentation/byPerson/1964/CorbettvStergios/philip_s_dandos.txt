mr.
philip
s.
dandos
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
attorney
for
the
appellant
in
this
matter
has
very
briefly
and
fairly
succinctly
given
you
the
facts
in
this
particular
case,
up
to
a
point,
he
has
stated
that
there
was
no
difference.
there
is
one
though
that
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
and
this
pertains
to
article
ix,
section
1,
subsection
b
and
this
concerns
the
restrictions,
which
greece
itself
may
place.
now,
there
is
a
statement
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
on
this
matter
and
there
is
also
a
statement
that
counsel
here
made,
which
are
similar.
he
states
that
greece
may
place
restrictions
on
the
use
of
certain
property
in
coastal
areas.
i
think
if
you
read
it
a
little
bit
closer,
the
words
will
show
that
greece
may
place
restrictions
on
the
acquisition
of
the
property
as
well
as
on
the
use,
lease,
and
occupancy
in
the
coastal
area.
now,
it
is
the
contention
of
the
appellant
in
this
matter
that
a
reading
of
the
treaty
herein
will
support
the
position
taken
by
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
and
the
district
court
of
iowa.
we
realize
that
there
are
certain
statements
in
the
opinions
of
both
courts,
which
may
not
support
the
position
taken
by
the
appellee
herein,
but
we
feel
that
reading
the
words
of
the
friendship
treaty
that
we
are
fully
supported
in
our
position.
now,
what
did
the
friendship
treaty
with
greece
provide?
the
important
provision
is
article
ix.
article
ix
provides
for
the
acquisition
of
certain
property
by
purchase
or
otherwise,
otherwise
we
take
that
here
is
liberally
construed
by
the
state
department
as
well
as
by
counsel
for
the
appellant
to
include
inheritance
rights.
subsection
a
of
section
1
of
article
ix
provides
that
certain
state
laws
will
be
applied
or
are
applicable
as
far
as
national
treatment
is
concerned.
it
is
our
contention
herein
that
the
iowa
code,
section
567.8
is
applicable
by
the
terms
of
this
statute
--
by
the
terms
of
this
treaty.
the
appellant
apparently
agrees
with
this
position.
however,
i
should
call
your
attention
to
the
position
taken
by
the
state
department
in
their
letter
in
appendix
a,
wherein
they
state
that
article
ix,
section
1
is
subject
to
local
laws,
which
may
limit
the
rights
of
aliens
to
hold
property
and
they
underline
the
word
hold.
however,
we
feel
that
this
interpretation
taken
by
the
state
department,
which
would
limit
it
simply
to
holding
statutes
is
not
in
agreement
with
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words,
which
state
that
local
laws
do
apply.
i
should
further
call
your
attention
to
this
same
letter
by
abraham
chase
in
which
he
states
under
article
ix,
subsection
2
that
a
limitation
is
placed
upon
this
exception
for
the
state
laws
prohibiting
alien
ownership
of
realty
by
requiring
that
an
alien
be
allowed
5
years
in
which
to
dispose
of
real
property
he
has
acquired
through
inheritance.
in
other
words,
the
position
taken
by
the
state
department
in
this
matter
would
seem
to
conflict
to
us
with
the
position
taken
by
appellants.
in
other
words,
they
are
going
on
the
position
that
article
ix,
subsection
1
applies
local
laws
as
far
as
the
holding
of
real
property
is
concerned.
however,
we
feel
that
when
you
read
subsection
b
and
read
the
restrictions
that
greece
is
allowed
to
impose,
restrictions
on
the
acquisition
and
restrictions
on
the
lease,
use
and
occupancy
in
particular
coastal
areas
that
it
goes
much
beyond
just
a
holding
statute.
now,
we've
also
taken
the
position
that
section
2
when
read
with
section
1
is
simply
an
application
or
an
extension
of
the
period
of
time
which
property
maybe
held
that
the
state
law,
holds
that
it
will
be
held
for
a
period
of
less
than
three
years.
now,
we
go
back
to
the
preamble
of
this
treaty,
which
states
that
it
is
a
treaty
of
friendship
and
that
it's
going
to
be
founded
on
principles
of
most
favored
nation
treatment
unconditionally
accorded
and
national
treatment.
now,
we
state
that
if
national
treatment
is
to
mean
anything,
then
the
important
section
is
section
1.
if
we
read
section
2
as
is
contended
by
the
appellants
in
this
matter,
then
section
1
becomes
almost
meaningless.
in
other
words,
you
can
do
almost
anything
you
want
to
under
section
2
and
section
1,
it
really
doesn't
matter.
now,
they've
said
specifically
that
it
applies
to
--
section
1
applies
to
fee
simple
interest,
we
think
that
it
applies
to
all
interests.
in
other
words,
as
long
as
reciprocity
is
shown,
any
interest
that
the
individual
might
have
or
might
acquire
is
applicable.
under
subsection
2
however,
if
the
interest
under
the
law
is
for
a
period
of
less
than
3
years
and
the
state
law
provides
for
a
disposition
within
that
period,
then
the
person
claiming
is
given
a
longer
period
of
time
in
order
to
dispose
of
the
property.
we
think
that,
that
is
all
that
particular
section
means.
the
appellants
have
made
much
of
the
fact
that
under
their
interpretation
of
the
law
it
isn't
necessary
to
prove
reciprocity.
in
other
words,
the
only
thing
that
they
have
to
do
is
go
in
with
the
treaty.
they
go
even
a
bit
further
in
their
brief.
they
state
that
even
though
it
is
shown
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
reciprocity
does
not
in
fact
exist,
they
can
still
take
the
property.
now
feel
that
if
that
is
the
interpretation
to
be
placed
upon
this
section
of
the
treaty
then
it
defeats
the
purpose
of
the
reciprocity
as
set
out
in
the
preamble
to
the
treaty.
it
really
defeats
the
purpose
of
the
treaty
itself,
in
other
words,
to
grant
reciprocal
rights
in
certain
instances
to
citizens
of
greece
and
citizens
of
the
united
states.
they've
also
referred
to
the
case
of
clark
versus
allen,
which
was
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
1947
and
i
will
admit,
that
particular
case
gives
the
appellee
some
difficulty.
the
distinguishing
feature,
however,
we
believe
is
that
the
statute
or
the
treaty
provision
under
which
it
was
decided
is
stated
in
different
terms
than
this
particular
treaty.
this
particular
treaty
sets
out
in
section
1,
the
rights
that
are
to
be
acquired
and
in
section
2
as
to
how
the
property
is
to
be
disposed
of
and
we
feel
that
this
is
the
distinguishing
features
as
far
as
clark
versus
allen
is
concerned.
now,
the
question
was
asked
as
to
whether
or
not
the
burden
could
have
been
met
in
this
particular
case.
i
call
attention
to
the
court
to
the
fact
that
in
this
case,
a
greek
law
expert
was
called
to
testify,
that
this
expert
who
would
been
a
member
of
both
the
united
states
bar
and
the
athens
bar
was
not
at
any
time
asked
the
simple
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
rights
in
greece
were
reciprocal
as
far
as
the
citizen
of
the
united
states
was
concerned.
we
see
that
there
is
no
great
burden
as
far
as
proving
the
reciprocity
is
concerned
should
the
appellants
in
this
particular
case
have
cared
to
do
so.
but,
they
chose
to
sit
on
their
interpretation
of
the
treaty,
which
we
feel
goes
beyond
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words
of
the
treaty.
now,
the
question
was
also
asked
by
this
court
as
to
whether
or
not
this
applies
to
personal
property.
there
is
in
appendix
c
in
the
memorandum
submitted
by
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states,
an
opinion
of
the
deputy
legal
advisor
wherein
it
is
stated
that
although
the
terminology
of
paragraph
2
is
vague,
that
personal
property
does
apply.
well
if
that
is
the
case,
and
it
is
to
include
all
property,
personal
property
or
real
property,
because
the
word
just
property
is
used
and
that
brings
in
everything,
well
then
the
words
of
section
1
in
themselves
are
meaningless.
attention
is
also
directed
in
the
letter
where
it
says
the
term
succession
in
paragraph
2
in
the
light
of
customary
references
to
inheritance
of
real
property
and
succession
of
personal
property.
now,
paragraph
2
apparently
refers
to
succession
of
property,
but
i
think
the
distinction
made
there,
if
that
distinction
is
to
be
made
would
almost
read
out
section
2
as
far
as
real
property
is
concerned,
i
don't
understand
how
under
their
interpretation,
for
paragraph
2
they
are
going
to
bring
in
personal
property,
because
if
succession
refers
to
personal
property
and
the
terms
of
the
treaty
under
section
2
or
paragraph
2
referred
to
succession,
then
this
would
seem
under
their
own
definition
to
read
out
the
application
of
real
property,
and
i
don't
think
that
was
what
is
intended
by
the
treaty
itself.
now,
there's
also
been
some
reference
made
in
this
case
as
to
reciprocity
concerning
adoption
laws
and
i
think
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
the
trial
court
here
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
was
--
not
the
united
states,
excuse
me,
state
of
iowa
was
confused
what
they
really
in
fact
were
trying
to
get
at
is
the
that
they
really
don't
want
to
recognize
an
adoption
process
where
the
relationship
between
the
adoptive
parent
and
the
adoptive
child
is
different
than
the
relationship
between
the
adoptive
parent
and
the
adoptive
child
in
iowa
law.
now,
this
is
completely
different
from
what
is
intended
under
the
reciprocal
rights
statute.
there
isn't
any
question
about
that,
but
what
the
iowa
law
says
is
and
what
the
court
is
trying
to
say
although
it
doesn't
use
very
good
terminology,
we're
not
going
to
recognize
the
relationship
and
if
the
iowa
court
should
in
that
instance
refuse
to
recognize
this
relationship
as
a
matter
of
their
own
law,
then
the
question
as
far
as
reciprocity
under
the
reciprocal
rights
statute
becomes
immaterial.
in
other
words,
they
don't'
acquire
anything
under
iowa
law,
therefore,
whatever
interpretation
we
might
have
of
the
reciprocal
right
statutes
and
the
application
of
the
treaty
in
it
just
isn't
material.
it's
the
whole
point
of
it,
but
unfortunately
and
i
will
agree
that
the
language
used
by
both
the
trial
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
doesn't
spell
it
out
as
explicitly
as
it
should,
but
i
think
the
facts
in
the
case
and
i
think
implicit
in
any
analysis
of
the
case
would
be
that
under
iowa
law,
the
process
of
adoption
herein
isn't
really
being
recognized,
at
least
recognized
as
far
as
granting
rights
under
the
iowa
law.
now,
this
is
different
than
recognizing
the
adoption
as
having
been
made
in
greece.
this
is
to
say
that
the
adoption
under
iowa
law
isn't
going
to
be
given
effect.
for
instance,
the
adoption
relationship
is
a
matter
of
local
law
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
iowa
can
make
the
determination.
now,
whether
or
not
the
foreign
country
or
wherever
it
happens
to
be,
it
could
be
another
state.
it
might
have
differing
adoption
laws.
i
think
they
can
make
that
distinction
and
the
court
is
bound
by
it.
mr.
philip
s.
dandos
if
they
–-
mr.
philip
s.
dandos
they
say
that
if
that's
what
their
adoption
statute
is
and
that's
the
relationship
flowing
from
the
--
mr.
philip
s.
dandos
i
guess
we're
bound
by
it,
but
i
don't
think
that
that
is
completely
what
they
intended
to.
mr.
philip
s.
dandos
but
i
think
that
if
they're
saying
that
that's
what
their
reciprocal
rights
statute
means,
i
guess
we
would
be
bound
by
it.
mr.
philip
s.
dandos
and
the
court
would
be
bound
by
it,
that's
correct.
it
is
and
has
been
our
contention
as
far
as
the
appellee
is
concerned
that
despite
certain
statements
in
the
opinion
of
both
the
trial
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
and
i
would
concur
in
what
the
appellant
said
as
far
as
the
question
of
section
24
of
the
treaty,
which
is
a
definition
of
national
treatment
in
which
the
iowa
court
in
part,
i
would
agree
and
this
construes
at
a
point.
and
i
don't
think
that,
that
in
itself
does
limit
it,
nevertheless
i'd
still
think
that
construing
the
plain
meaning
of
the
treaty
and
taking
the
treaty
as
a
whole
that
recovery
--
mr.
philip
s.
dandos
–
or
the
contention
of
a
plaintiff
that
it
is
that
the
treaty
nullifies
the
statute
is
erroneous
and
that
the
court
in
this
particular
matter
should
continue
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
iowa
supreme
court
as
far
as
this
particular
case
is
concerned.
