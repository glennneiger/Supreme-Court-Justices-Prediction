there
had
been
what?

article

section

justice

stewart
article
ix.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
on
page
26
of
your
appendix,
isn't
it,
of
the
appendix
to
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
eidsmoe,
you
as
i
understand
it,
rely
exclusively
on
section
2
of
article
ix
of
the
treaty,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
i
read
the
words
of
that,
it
gives
a
right
of
disposition
of
property
within
a
period
of
5
years.
the
property
with
respect
to
the
acquisition
of
which
through
testate
or
intestate
succession,
their
alienage
has
prevented
them
from
receiving
national
treatment.
i
don't
quite
see
how
these
words
fit
your
case.
in
other
words,
these
words
have
to
do
with
the
right
to
dispose
of
property.
your
case
is
the
right
to
inherit
property
in
the
first
place?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
problem
on
reciprocity
was
the
capacity
of
the
adoptive
parent
to
inherit
from
the
adopted
child.
isn't
there
some
discussion
of
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i
read
these
briefs
some
time
ago.
justice
potter
stewart
or
the
adopted
child
--
justice
potter
stewart
adoptive
parent,
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
that
even
if
you're
wrong
as
to
your
theory
as
to
what
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
was
trying
to
say
and
even
if
what
they
were
trying
to
do
and
were
doing
was
construing
your
reciprocal
statute
in
a
way,
which
seems
very
odd
to
you
and
to
me,
nonetheless
that
construction
would
be
binding
upon
us
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
know
if
you
would
understand
my
question,
but
what
the
reciprocal
statute
seems
to
say
is
that
if
an
adoptive
child
could
inherit
in
this
way
in
greece,
then
he
can
do
--
then
the
same
thing
will
prevail
in
iowa.
then
they
--
your
court
got
into
all
problems
of
whether
the
adoptive
parent
could
inherit
from
the
child,
which
seems
very
wide
of
the
mark,
but
if
they
were
saying
that's
what
the
statute
means
even
though
you
and
i
don't
think
it
does
mean
that
then
nonetheless,
we're
bound
by
what
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
says
it
means?
justice
potter
stewart
or
that's
what
their
reciprocal
statute
is
and
we're
bound
by
it,
aren't
we?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
perhaps
not,
perhaps
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
--
and
this
court
is
bound
by
it.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
understand
the
treaty?
it
gives
you
an
absolute
right
to
two-thirds
of
the
property
as
though
by
intestacy,
but
then
a
duty
to
dispose
of
it
within
5
years?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
given
a
5-year
beneficial
estate?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
told
us
that
except
for
an
old
automobile,
all
of
this
estate
is
real
estate?
