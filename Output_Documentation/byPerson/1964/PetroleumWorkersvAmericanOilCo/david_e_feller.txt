mr.
david
e.
feller
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
out
of
a
suit
by
a
union
to
compel
arbitration
of
grievance
which
the
union
filed
complaining
that
the
employer
violated
the
agreement
and
has
passed
practice
by
contracting
out
certain
work.
now
the
case
is,
in
many
respects,
a
replay
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
warrior
&
gulf
and
american
manufacturing
cases,
i
think
in
the
brief
time
i
have
--
i
can
best
describe
the
case
in
terms
of
its
factual
background
going
way
back
before
the
filing
of
this
grievance.
this
--
i'm
sorry,
until
1952,
this
union
which
represents
the
employees
at
a
refinery
in
whiting,
indiana,
had
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
employer,
which
provided
in
very
broad
terms
that
any
questions
at
all
arising
during
the
term
of
the
agreement
and
specifically
questions
pertaining
to
rates
of
pay,
wages,
hours
of
employment,
or
other
conditions
of
the
employment
not
covered
by
the
contract
could
be
processed,
those
questions
could
be
processed
during
the
term
of
the
agreement
through
the
grievance
procedure
and
be
taken
to
arbitration.
here,
they
used
to
arbitrate
what
the
wager
rates
used
to
be.
in
1952,
and
this
is
all
reflected
in
the
affidavits
filed
in
the
court
below
in
this
case,
the
agreement
of
the
parties
was
changed
to
provide
insofar
as
relevant
here
that
arbitration
would
be
limited
to
questions
involving
--
directly
involving
alleged
violations
of
the
agreement
and
also
questions
alleging
a
violation
of
past
practice,
custom,
or
usage
relative
to
working
conditions.
this
cause
remained
in
the
agreement,
virtually
unchanged
in
successive
agreements
from
1952
on.
it
also
provided
that
with
respect
to
matters
not
covered
by
the
agreement
in
the
area
of
wages,
hours,
and
working
conditions,
the
grievance
procedure
could
be
used.
indeed,
the
grievance
procedure
was
open
to
any
question
at
all.
but
that
rather
than
arbitrate,
if
the
company
refused
to
arbitrate,
the
union
could
strike.
this
was
the
form
of
the
grievance
procedure
language
in
the
agreement
of
march
1957,
which
was
the
first
agreement
with
which
we're
concerned
here.
during
that
time
--
term
of
that
agreement,
there
arose
a
grievance
filed
by
certain
cement
finishers,
now
called
the
cement
finishers'
grievance,
who
claimed
that
the
company
by
contracting
out
certain
cement
finishing
work
had
violated
the
terms
of
the
agreement
and
specifically
the
recognition
clause
and
had
violated
past
practice
which
was
that
this
kind
of
work
should
always
be
done
by
employees
in
the
bargaining
union.
the
case
was
carried
through
the
grievance
procedure.
the
company
refused
to
arbitrate
and
the
union
brought
suit.
in
the
cement
finishers'
case,
the
union
suit
asked
only
that
the
claim
that
this
action
of
the
company
violated
past
practice
be
arbitrated.
the
district
court
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
grievance
was
not
arbitrable
under
the
then
state
of
law.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
particularly
upon
the
then
fifth
circuit
decision
in
the
warrior
&
gulf
case
as
well
as
in
the
first
circuit's
decision
of
the
local
201
case,
which
said
that
no
grievance
was
arbitrable
unless
the
court
could
find
a
governing
provision
in
the
contract
which
would
guide
the
arbitrator
to
dispose
of
the
grievance.
that
decision
came
down
in
march
1960,
whereas
this
court
on
june
20th,
1960
reversed
the
warrior
&
gulf
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
and
impliedly,
though
not
specifically,
reversed
the
rule
announced
by
judge
magruder
in
the
first
circuit
which
have
been
relied
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
set
down
the
rule
which
has
been
followed
in
the
federal
courts
ever
since.
subsequent
to
the
court's
decision,
this
court's
decision
in
march
of
1960,
two
things
happened.
first,
the
parties
then
extended
their
agreement
--
excuse
me,
a
new
agreement
without
changing
the
language.
that
occurred
in
august
1960
and
in
october
1960,
what
i
will
call
the
crane
operators'
grievance
arose.
the
company
contracted
out
certain
crane
operation
work.
the
union
filed
a
grievance
and
sought
to
have
it
arbitrated
and
the
company
refused.
in
this
case,
the
suit
was
in
two
parts
and
that
is
the
present
case.
the
first
claim
was
that
the
company
was
obligated
to
arbitrate
the
union's
claim
that
it
had
violated
the
agreement
and
specifically
the
recognition
clause
by
giving
the
work,
the
crane
work,
to
an
outside
contractor.
the
second
paragraph
of
the
complaint
was
broken
into
two
paragraphs.
claim
that
the
company
had
violated
past
practice,
that
the
past
practice
was
to
have
this
work
done
by
the
crane
operators
employed
by
the
company
and
the
union
asked
that
that
claim
be
arbitrated.
after
an
answer
was
filed,
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
filed
by
the
union
on
paragraph
1,
the
complaint
asking
arbitration
of
the
claim
of
violation
of
the
agreement.
the
defendant
company
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
asking
that
both
paragraphs
of
the
complaint
be
dismissed.
the
district
court
held
that
the
dispute
was
an
arbitrable
dispute
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
warrior
&
gulf
and
american
manufacturing
cases
and
ordered
the
defendant
to
arbitrate
the
grievance,
the
entire
grievance
but
it
rested
that
entirely
on
paragraph
1
of
the
complaint
and
dismissed
paragraph
2
as
moot
and
denied
of
course
the
defendant's
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
defendant
appealed.
the
court
of
appeals
held
on
appeal,
reversing
the
district
court,
first,
that
this
dispute
was
not
an
arbitrable
dispute.
and
i
will
not
try
to
paraphrase
the
reasoning
in
the
court
of
appeals
but
basically
i
think
it
was
that
it
could
not
find
any
governing
provision
in
the
agreement
which
would
govern
an
arbitrator's
disposition
of
the
case
and
therefore,
there
was
nothing
to
arbitrate.
it
characterized
as
a
rather
strong
language
the
union's
contention
that
its
claim
that
the
company
violated
the
agreement
made
the
dispute
arbitrable.
it
held
as
an
alternate
holding
that
the
prior
decision
in
the
cement
finishers'
case
constituted
a
collateral
estoppel
which
prevented
the
union
from
processing
this
grievance
or
indeed
any
other
grievance
involving
the
contracting
out
of
work,
and
this
court
of
course
granted
certiorari.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
i
think
this
case
is
a
very
simple
and
easy
case
because
i
think
it
is
governed
fully
and
without
reasonable
possibility
of
distinction
by
the
two
decisions
which
this
court
issued
in
june
of
1960.
in
the
american
manufacturing
case,
this
court
held
that
where
the
parties
have
agreed
that
questions
of
interpretation
or
application
or
claimed
violation
of
an
agreement,
are
to
be
determined
by
an
arbitrator.
then
when
the
union
makes
such
a
claim,
that
is
that
the
employer
violated
the
agreement
and
that
the
employer
is
wrong,
action
was
erroneous
as
a
matter
of
interpretation
or
application
of
the
agreement
then
that
claim
is
entitled
to
be
arbitrated
because
that's
what
the
parties
have
said,
that
any
such
claim
shall
be
arbitrated.
the
court
in
passing
on
the
question
of
arbitrability,
this
court
said
does
not
have
to
decide
whether
there
is
merit
in
the
grievance
or
whether
in
its
view,
the
contract
covers
the
grievance
or
not.
the
question
which
is
to
be
arbitrated
is
whether
is
the
claim
which
the
union
has
made
that
the
company
violated
the
agreement.
the
measurement
is
not
to
be
made
in
the
terms
of
subject
matter
or
anything
else
but
in
terms
of
what
the
union's
claim
is,
i.e.
what
is
the
arbitrator
to
decide.
and
just
so
in
this
case,
the
union
is
asked
to
have
arbitrated
its
claim
that
the
company's
action
violated
the
agreement
and
this
court
said,
it
is
not
part
of
any
court's
business
to
decide
whether
there
is
merit
in
that
claim
or
not.
the
court
--
the
only
function
of
the
court
is
to
determine
whether
the
employer
has
agreed
to
arbitrate
such
claims.
the
other
part
of
this
case
is
the
claim
that
the
company
violated,
if
it
did
not
violate
the
agreement,
violated
a
past
practice,
such
a
claim
which
this
agreement
makes
it
arbitrable.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
the
question
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
that's
--
basically,
if
the
arbitrator
decides
that
there
is
no
provision
on
the
contract
governing
such
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
the
court
orders
arbitration
of
that
claim.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
think
the
court
can
inquire
to
see
if
it
is
a
genuine
claim
in
a
sense
that
do
you
claim
or
which
term
of
the
agreement
do
you
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
claim
is
violated?
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
don't
regard
arbitrability
as
a
kind
of
a
separate
subject.
obviously,
i
suppose
the
union
can
say
that's
none
of
your
business.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
think
the
court
ought
to
say,
“mr.
company,
you
arbitrate
the
claim
that
you
have
violated
the
agreement”,
not
the
question
of
whether
your
contract
--
conduct
is
proper
or
fair
or
should
be
held
to
be
wrong.
mr.
david
e.
feller
it
very
well
may.
in
many
cases,
this
was
the
whole
--
in
the
discussion
which
i've
had
with
this
court
in
1960.
we
had
judge
magruder's
theory
which
was
then
as
expressed
in
the
two,
in
one
of
the
cases
was
cited
in
the
first
decision
here
that
the
court
had
to
determine
for
itself
whether
there
was
a
term
of
the
agreement
which
the
arbitrator
could
use
as
a
governing
standard.
but
of
course
that
involves
interpretation
of
the
agreement
and
because
there
are
many
restrictions
in
an
agreement
which
are
implied
not
expressed.
and
this
court
said,
it
is
none
of
the
court's
business
to
determine
the
nature
of
the
standards
which
the
arbitrator
applies
or
whether
in
fact
there
are
any
at
all.
perhaps,
the
arbitrator
will
look
at
the
case
and
says,
“you
have
claimed
that
they
violated
the
agreement.
you
are
unable
to
show
me
any
provision
of
the
agreement
which
i
can
find
governs
this
agreement,
and
therefore
this
conduct
is
unregulated
by
the
agreement.
grievance
denied”.
but
that
is
not
the
function
of
the
court.
that
is
the
function
of
the
arbitrator.
now,
on
the
second
provision
which
we
ask
arbitration
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
indeed,
that
is
the
classic
case
in
which
the
union
claims
that
you
violate
the
recognition
clause
of
the
agreement.
when
you
take
the
facts
in
the
(inaudible)
case
and
put
them
into
this
record,
i
would
say
that
arbitrators
by
enlarge
insofar
as
you
can
generalize
about
their
decisions,
the
kinds
of
contracting
out
which
arbitrated
genuinely
--
generally
find
to
be
violations
of
the
implied
obligation
of
good
faith
and
the
recognition
clause
are
the
kinds
of
contracting
out
in
which
you,
as
they
say,
arbitrarily
reduced
the
scope
of
the
bargaining
unit
and
of
course
eliminating
the
bargaining
unit
with
the
most
--
the
strongest
case
of
arbitrarily
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
reducing
its
scope.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
think
they
would
be
entitled
to
have
that
claim.
mr.
david
e.
feller
decided
by
an
arbitrator.
as
you
state
the
case,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
very
good
case
or
as
i
think
with
--
in
the
discussion
of
the
warrior
&
gulf
case.
suppose
the
contract
provided
four
hours
call-in
pay
and
an
employee
come
in
and
said
i
want
eight
hours
call-in
pay
because
that's
what
it
says
in
the
agreement.
the
agreement
plainly
sets
forth.
but
he's
entitled
to
have
that
question
decided
by
an
arbitrator
even
though
it
may
be
plain
to
you,
to
me
or
to
anybody
but
that
full
of
an
arbitrator
that
this
is
what
the
contract
means
because
it
is
the
arbitrator's
judgment
which
the
parties
have
bargained
it
for.
the
arbitrator's
interpretation
of
the
agreement,
the
arbitrator's
interpretation
of
what
is
implied
in
the
agreement
and
what
is
not
implied
in
the
agreement.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
again
that
the
conduct
in
the
case
is
governed
by
the
agreement.
it
very
well
may
not
be,
but
that
is
the
question
of
interpretation
and
application
of
the
agreement.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
there
are
no
--
nonarbitrable
claims
of
violation
of
the
agreement.
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
e.
feller
under
an
agreement
which
says,
that
the
claims
of
violation
agreement
shall
be
arbitrated.
i
think
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
that's
almost
chronological.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
now,
if
you're
talking
about
the
arbitration,
then
i
have
to
look
at
the
arbitration
clause,
the
arbitration
clause
may
say
only
questions
concerning
wages
may
be
arbitrated.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
think
i
could
make
it
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
under
application
and
interpretation
that
--
in
each
case,
you
have
to
look
at
the
content,
the
scope
which
the
arbitration
clause
is
intended
to
be
given.
and
in
this
case,
i
think
that
the
language
is
such.
it
says,
directly
involving.
and
i
frankly
say
it
in
a
way
--
directly
involving
any
allegation
of
violation
of
the
agreement
and
this
was
an
allegation
of
violation
of
the
agreement.
and
i
think
that
is
--
that
is
an
open-and-shut
matter
under
this
court's
decision
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
in
american
manufacturing.
mr.
david
e.
feller
oh
no.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
no.
as
i
tried
to
make
it
clear,
prior
to
1952
when
these
words
were
put
in,
you
could
file
any
sort
of
claim
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
not
claiming
a
violation
of
the
agreement.
you
say
this
isn't
covered
by
the
agreement.
we
think
the
wages
for
this
job
ought
to
be
higher
and
you
could
file
that
claim,
the
company
was
obliged
there
and
they
had
to
arbitrate
it,
and
they
did.
in
the
appendix
to
this
very
agreement,
there
are
some
wage
rates
which
are
set
and
stated
to
be
pursuant
to
an
arbitrator's
award.
these
were
arbitrator's
award
prior
to
1952.
there
are
contracts
in
which
party
say
any
matter
relating
to
wages,
hours
and
working
conditions
that
you
want
to
take
up,
you
can
take
up
and
if
we
can't
reach
agreement
on
it,
we
will
arbitrate
it.
mr.
david
e.
feller
it
has
--
the
limitation,
there
are
two
limitations.
one,
it
says,
that
with
respect
to,
and
i
think
i
better
spell
it
out.
it's
on
pages
11
and
12
of
the
record
of
the
record.
questions
which
may
be
referred
to
arbitration
shall
be
limited
to
questions
directly
involving
or
arising
from
applications,
interpretations
or
alleged
violations
of
the
terms
of
the
agreement.
where
we
get
into
working
conditions,
it's
over
on
turning
the
page
over
at
the
top
of
page
12
of
the
record
where
it
says,
questions
of
applications
or
interpretations
or
alleged
non-compliance
with
past
policies,
practice,
customs,
and
usages
relative
to
working
conditions
also
are
arbitrable,
even
if
they
are
not
covered
in
the
agreement.
and
finally,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
in
(d),
it
says
the
company
will
bargain
with
the
union
with
respect
to
matters
relating
to
rates
of
pay,
hours
of
employment,
and
other
conditions
of
employment
that
brought
us
possible
scope
which
are
not
covered
in
this
agreement
or
in
any
side
agreement.
but
each
party
shall
have
the
right
to
refuse
to
arbitrate
any
such
matter
and
then
the
no-strike
clause
applies.
so
i
suppose
that
any
matter
within
the
scope
of
bargaining
under
the
act
can
be
processed
through
this
grievance
procedure.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
under
my
interpretation
of
(a)
what
is
--
what
is
the
consequence
of
(d)
is
if
the
union
comes
in
and
says,
“well,
there's
no
provision
on
the
allocation
of
overtime”
and
i
don't
have
the
full
contract
or
on
some
other
matter
relating
to
wages,
hours
and
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
it's
not
a
very
big
agreement.
i
can
--
i
know
the
basic,
still
the
agreement
is
about
ten
times
as
big
as
this.
i'm
sure
there
are
a
lot
of
matters
within
the
scope
of
bargaining
not
covered
by
this
agreement,
and
if
the
union
comes
in
and
says,
“we
want
such
a
provision,”
the
company
here
says,
“it
will
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
the
court
can
order
arbitration
of
the
claim
that
is
not
--
that
it
is
covered
by
the
agreement.
now,
if
the
arbitrator
then
says,
this
is
not
covered
by
the
agreement
then
it
falls
within
(d)
and
subsequently,
the
union
can
ask
for
the
relief
at
once
and
try
it.
but
the
question
is
not
--
the
court
doesn't
determine
whether
it's
covered
by
the
agreement
because
that
involves
the
interpretation
and
application
of
the
agreement.
the
arbitrator
determines
that.
if
it
is
something
which
the
parties
agree
is
not
covered
by
the
agreement,
then
(d)
applies.
if
there's
a
dispute
about
it,
if
the
union
files
a
claim
if
it
wishes
to,
that
the
company's
action
violated
the
agreement
and
the
arbitrator
determines
that.
i'd
like
to
save
a
little
time
for
rebuttal
so
i
just
want
to
say
one
word
about
the
collateral
estoppel
issue.
in
our
view,
the
collateral
estoppel
issue
is
really
an
almost
frivolous
issue
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
claim
of
violation
of
agreement
which
we've
been
talking
about
wasn't
involved
in
the
cement
finishers'
case.
that
was
only
a
claim
under
the
past
practice
clause.
and
second
of
all,
we
think
it's
clear
that
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
is
subject
to
the
exception
that
where
there
is
a
change
in
the
law,
that
doctrine
does
not
apply.
it
is
not
a
question
of
res
judicata.
that
was
a
different
grievance.
that
was
the
cement
finishers'
grievance.
we
now
have
the
crane
operators'
grievance.
and
we
think
that
it
is
clear
that
the
--
this
court's
decision
in
june
of
1960
did
make
a
substantial
change
in
the
law
and
in
addition
to
the
other
reasons
which
we
spelled
out
in
the
brief,
we
think
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
has
no
applicability.
one
final
word,
the
company
says
that
both
claims
are
not
here
and
i
will
confess
that
the
court
below,
both
courts
below,
regarded
this
whole
case
and
the
question
is,
does
the
company
oblige
to
arbitrate
the
question
of
contracting
out.
as
i
think
the
--
this
court's
decisions
in
1960
said
and
it's
the
essence
of
our
argument,
the
court
does
not
decide
whether
a
subject
matter
is
arbitrable
nor
does
the
arbitrator
decides
subject
matter.
the
arbitrator
decides
claims.
there
was
a
claim
in
this
case
that
the
company
violated
the
agreement.
there
was
a
claim
in
this
case
that
it
violated
past
practice.
those
are
two
separate
claims.
the
district
court
regarded
them
as
one
and
it
found
arbitrability
as
to
one
and
said
arbitrate
the
grievance,
the
whole
grievance.
the
court
of
appeals
operated
in
the
same
way.
it
said
those
are
two
reasons
why
you
arbitrate
and
we
will
reverse
on
both.
now,
there
are
both
here
because
the
court
of
appeals
directed
summary
judgment
for
company
both
claims.
but
any
question
that
are
not
here
disappears
when
you
look
correctly
as
i
think
this
court's
decision
requiring
it
to
do,
the
fact
that
the
court
orders
not
a
grievance
arbitrator,
it
ordered
--
it
says
that
this
issue
will
be
arbitrated.
if
the
court
sustained
this
under
the
10
(a)
(1),
the
violation,
then
arbitrator
will
decide
whether
the
company's
action
violated
the
agreement.
that's
all
they
decided,
not
whether
it
was
good,
proper,
fair
or
violated
past
practice.
if
the
court
says
that
the
claim
a
violation
of
past
practice,
it's
arbitrable
as
we
think
it
is
under
parallel
reasoning,
then
the
arbitrator
decides
did
the
company's
action
violate
past
practice.
and
i
think
that
solves
our
problem.
thank
you.
mr.
david
e.
feller
thank
you
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
--
i
think
the
collateral
estoppel
point
here
is
helpful
in
a
way
in
putting
this
thing
on
the
track.
mr.
anderson
says,
the
question
is
whether
there
was
a
promise
to
arbitrate
a
contracting
out
grievance.
the
question
is
whether
questions
of
contracting
out
can
be
arbitrated.
the
reason
we
get
into
this
problem
as
to
what's
here
is
that
too
many
people
have
talked
in
those
terms.
and
i'll
make
it
clear,
i'm
not
here
arguing
that
a
contracting
out
grievance
is
arbitrable.
i
don't
know
what
a
contracting
out
grievance
is.
i
suppose
that
the
subject
matter
of
the
grievance
is
contracting
out.
i'm
arguing
here
that
a
grievance
which
claims
that
the
company
has
violated
the
agreement
when
it
contracted
out
is
arbitrable.
and
that's
a
different
question.
mr.
david
e.
feller
the
--
well,
i
have
relied
on
the
contract
for
the
--
for
the
arbitrability,
section
10
(a)
(1)
which
says
that
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
we
go
back
--
now,
i
take
it
mr.
justice
black
you're
asking
me
what
section
we
rely
on
to
say
that
the
grievance
is
arbitrable,
not
what
section
we
rely
on
to
say
that
the
company
violated
the
agreement.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
is
correct.
and
that
we
rely
on
section
10
(a)
(1)
which
is
on
page
11
of
the
record,
near
the
bottom
of
the
page,
“questions
directly
involving
or
arising
from
applications,
interpretations,
or
alleged
violations
of
the
terms
of
this
agreement”.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
right.
in
this
case,
we
allege
a
violation
of
the
agreement.
and
in
almost
haec
verba,
this
question
is
then
arbitrable.
now,
you
could
have
a
contracting
out
grievance
and
indeed
i
have
seen
many
of
them
in
many
contracts
including
this
one
in
which
you
can
process
grievances
not
alleging
violations
of
agreement
up
to
arbitration
and
we
say,
it
is
unfair
of
the
company
to
contract
out
this
work
when
there
are
people
on
layoff.
and
that
--
and
you
negotiate
on
that.
you'll
handle
that
to
the
process.
sometimes
the
company
agrees
that
it
is
unfair
for
them
to
do
it
and
they
agree
that
they
won't
do
it
again
or
they'll
kick
the
contract,
they're
off
the
job,
and
bring
people
in.
that's
a
contracting
out
grievance
but
that's
not
an
arbitrable
grievance
because
that
does
not
allege
a
violation
of
the
agreement.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
right
but
then
when
we
get
to
the
arbitrator
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
think
i've
just
given
something
of
that.
but
when
we
get
to
the
arbitrator
and
i
think
this
is
a
great
error
in
a
lot
of
the
thinking
in
this
area
that
the
arbitrator
just
kind
of
floats
in
the
air
and
decides
whether
the
grievance
is
a
good
one
or
a
bad
one.
all
the
arbitrator
is
going
to
decide
is
did
the
action
violate
the
agreement.
that's
all
he's
going
to
decide.
he
is
not
going
to
decide
whether
it
was
fair
or
unfair,
or
nice
or
not
nice.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
we
said
that
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
don't
know.
whether
we
got
to
court,
we
have
to
do
it.
when
we
got
to
the
arbitrator,
we
have
to
do
it.
and
every
time
i've
arbitrated
a
grievance,
before
i
go
to
the
arbitrator,
he
says,
“in
what
provision
of
the
contract
do
you
claim
is
violated?”
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
right.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
don't
think
i
do
unless
there's
some
question
of
good
faith
involved.
mr.
david
e.
feller
indeed
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
right.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
correct.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
correct.
because
i
might
argue
that
means
contract
out
in
the
normal,
usual
way
they
did
but
this
time,
they
did
something
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
different
which
wasn't
meant
by
that.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
for
the
arbitrator
to
decide.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
take
it
that
every
case
is
a
case
for
that
interpretation.
though
these
--
this
language,
my
brother
anderson,
is
almost
exactly
the
same
as
the
language
in
american
manufacturing
which
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
also
alleged
violations
of
past
practice.
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
which
we
get
over
to
three,
which
are
two
claims.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
think
if
it
said
application
and
interpretation,
those
words
are
usually
used
together
to
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
cover
the
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
correct.
the
basic
principle
i
think
is
that
the
court
can
respect
the
party's
intention
that
this
question
be
decided
by
an
arbitrator
and
--
but
when
we
get
to
arbitration
we
don't
arbitrate
in
general,
we
don't
arbitrate
--
and
that's
the
problem
with
the
collateral
estoppel
issue
and
the
whole
decision
below.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
david
e.
feller
i
think
the
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
the
question
is
--
the
question
--
he
could
phrase
it,
but
sometimes
arbitrators
do.
what
he
would
say
is,
well,
it's
here.
this
--
the
question
of
whether
this
agreement
restricts
the
management
from
contracting
out
is
before
me
and
i
find
that
there
is
no
such
restriction
and
therefore,
the
grievance
must
be
denied
even
though
i
think
--
may
think
it's
unfair,
though
i
hope
arbitrators
don't
do
that.
mr.
david
e.
feller
no,
your
honor.
that
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
is
not
my
position
and
it's
not
as
i
understand
the
decision
of
this
court,
mr.
justice
douglas'
opinion
in
warrior
&
gulf
and
american
manufacturing,
i
think
it
is
absolutely
crystal
clear
in
that.
mr.
david
e.
feller
it
said
the
court
should
determine
the
question
of
whether
--
if
the
kind
of
question
presented
and
i
keep
coming
back
to
that
is
one
which
the
parties
have
agreed
should
be
arbitrated,
and
that
is
for
the
court
to
discern.
and
in
some
cases,
there
are
a
number
of
recent
circuit
court
decisions
of
which
there
is
a
history
which
the
parties
agreed
that
say,
discharge
cases
should
not
be
arbitrated.
then
that's
up
to
the
court
to
interpret
that
arbitration
clause.
when
it
gets
to
the
arbitrator,
his
question
is
did
the
company
in
this
case
violate
the
agreement
or
not.
or
in
the
other
branch
of
the
case,
did
this
company
violate
past
practice
or
not.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
think
when
--
when
there's
--
that's
correct.
when
you
get
10
(d),
where
it
says
it
shall
not
have
the
right
to
refuse
to
arbitrate
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
if
the
arbitrator
says
or
if
the
parties
agreed
that
this
matter
is
not
covered
by
the
agreement,
in
most
cases
they
can
agree.
there
are
no
questions
--
there
are
no
provision
in
this
agreement
about
subject
x,
y
or
z
or
there
is
no
provision
here
and
this
is
really
as
to
fairness
or
unfairness
or
wage
rates,
prior
to
the
limitation
that
was
put
in
here
on
1952,
these
parties
used
to
arbitrate
wage
rates.
what
should
be
the
rate
on
this
particular
job?
now,
i
take
it
under
(d)
it
says
we
don't
arbitrate
that.
you
don't
claim
that
the
wage
rate
violates
the
agreement.
you
wouldn't
say,
well
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
“we
think
that
the
machinist
ought
to
be
paid
more”.
mr.
david
e.
feller
no,
i
think
what
(d)
--
my
view
is
that
(d)
is
the
exact
counterpart
of
(a)
(1),
(2),
and
(3)
and
the
substance
of
it
is
that
you
have
the
right
to
strike
over
claims
other
than
claims
of
violation
of
the
agreement
which
relate
to
wages,
hours
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
and
working
conditions.
mr.
david
e.
feller
as
far
as
the
court
is
concerned
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
oh
no.
sometimes
the
companies
have
gone
the
other
way.
there
is
a
case
in
the
record,
a
new
jersey
shop
man's
case
in
which
they
reversed
that,
they
struck
and
the
company
went
in
said,
“no,
that
strike
is
in
violation
of
the
agreement
because
it's
subject
to
the
agreement”.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well
--
well,
but
that's
more
than
the
form
of
words
because
it's
the
form
of
words
which
governs
what
the
arbitrator
will
decide.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that's
correct.
and
indeed,
we
cannot
strike
over
a
claim
of
violation
of
the
agreement.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
i
think
it
part
--
i
think
it
partakes
to
both,
but
the
problem
is
that
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
that
it
says,
each
party
shall
have
the
right
to
refuse
to
arbitrate
any
such
matter.
mr.
david
e.
feller
yes.
mr.
david
e.
feller
yes.
mr.
david
e.
feller
that
is
correct.
and
it
has
--
though
it
has
an
additional
significance
that
if
this
union
went
out
on
strike,
claiming
that
contracting
out
was
unfair,
(d)
would
be
insulated
from
liability
for
violation
of
the
no-strike
clause.
mr.
david
e.
feller
insofar
as
relevant
here,
there
are
no
change
in
the
words
in
the
successive
contracts.
and
i
--
we
have
abandoned
in
our
reply
brief
the
argument
which
we
made
in
our
original
brief
that
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
should
not
apply
to
successive
agreements
because
on
reading
the
company's
brief,
we
were
persuaded
that
this
was
bad
labor
law
and
bad
labor
policy.
that
a
view
that
regarded
successive
contracts
as
a
continuation
of
the
same
obligation,
the
same
statute
governing
industrial
community
with
a
far
preferable
one
and
we
would
not
like
to
win
the
collateral
estoppel
point
on
that
issue,
on
that
point.
we
think
we
do
win
--
win
it
on
the
other
two
points
and
we
clearly
win
it
on
the
claim
which
we've
been
discussing
here
a
violation
of
the
agreement
because
that
wasn't
even
involved
in
the
other
case.
mr.
david
e.
feller
it
is
true
in
this
case
as
it
was
in
warrior
&
gulf,
that
the
company
--
that
the
union
has,
in
here,
attempted
for
years
to
get
a
flat
ban
on
all
contracting
out
into
the
agreement
and
has
been
unsuccessful
in
doing
so.
but
this
does
not
mean
that
some
contracting
out
under
some
circumstances
may
not
violate
other
provisions
of
the
agreement.
contraction
out
can
be
from
casual
little
thing,
or
little
things
or
contracting
out
a
whole
issue.
the
union
would
like
to
have
a
provision
saying
no
contracting
out
of
any
work
at
any
time.
but
we've
been
unable
to
get
that
provision.
mr.
david
e.
feller
you
mean
in
the
first
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals?
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
the
only
issue
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
1960
was
the
claim
of
the
union
that
the
contracting
out
of
cement
finishing
work
violated
past
practice
not
the
--
there
was
no
allegation
in
the
complaint
in
that
case,
no
request
for
arbitration
--
mr.
david
e.
feller
--
of
the
violation
of
the
agreement.
mr.
david
e.
feller
they
held
that
the
claim
--
that
the
company
violated
past
practice
was
not
arbitrable.
mr.
david
e.
feller
well,
it's
the
essential
distinction
to
my
whole
approach
to
the
case
and
that
is
you
don't
argue
--
arbitrate
subject
matter
or
facts.
you
arbitrate
an
issue
and
the
issue
in
the
other
case
was
the
claim
the
company
violated
past
practice.
no
claim
that
it
violated
the
agreement.
in
this
case,
we
have
both
issues.
thank
you
your
honor.
