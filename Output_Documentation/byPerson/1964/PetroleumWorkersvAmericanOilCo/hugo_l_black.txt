justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you.
i
understood
you
say
that
the
contract
expressly
states
that
the
parties
agreed
that
they
would
not
submit
their
arbitration
with
respect
to
the
contracting
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
familiar
with
that
but
where
do
you
find
that
that
said
they
will
not
submit
questions
of
contracting
out
to
arbitrator.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
--
does
that
answer
the
argument
which
i
understood
mr.
feller
made
and
i
thought
he
did,
and
i
just
looked
to
the
brief
to
this
effect
that
the
question
of
arbitration
--
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
the
contract
is
agreed
to
be
submitted
to
arbitration.
and
as
i
understand
it,
he
said
that
if
the
court
decides
that
question,
then
it
has
defeated
that
provision
of
the
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
that
cannot
be
agreed
in
a
way?
do
you
not
have
to
say
that
in
order
to
meet
this
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
question
of
meaning
could
not
be
submitted
to
the
arbitrator?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
they
had
agreed
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
agree
to
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
get
back
to
the
question
of
whether
they
agree
to
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
not
--
you
are
not
challenging
in
any
way
the
right
of
the
party
to
make
such
an
agreement
if
they
did,
had
made
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
doesn't
quite
--
they
could
agree,
you
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
they
could
submit
the
meaning
of
this
to
the
arbitrator
at
all
times
and
all
circumstances
which
would
make
it
impossible
for
the
court
or
any
court
to
make
that
agreement,
have
anything
left
to
pass
on,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
doesn't
he
disagree
with
you
on
that,
does
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
he
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
was
your
real
issue,
the
main
issue,
before
you
get
to
--
with
the
contract
and
its
meaning.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
doesn't
have
to
--
it
doesn't
have
to
say
it
expressly,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
those
matters
are
not
in
issue
here,
are
they?
the
question
at
issue
as
i
understand
it
is
whether
the
one
he
holds,
whether
there's
an
agreement
on
that
side
of
his
argument,
whether
there's
agreement,
meaning
would
always
be
submitted
to
the
arbitrator
which
demands
in
effect
to
saying
there's
nothing
left
for
the
court
to
pass
on
as
far
as
that's
concerned.
they
can't
file
a
lawsuit
on
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
--
i
understood
him
to
rely
mainly
on
what
the
court
had
said
heretofore,
not
on
what
is
in
the
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
how
you
can
construe
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then,
may
i
--
may
say,
maybe
i
don't
quite
understand
you.
what
you're
saying
is
they
just
filled
with
things
that
they
don't
have
to
arbitrate.
the
question
is
whether
its
--
whether
that
scope
of
things
with
which
it
fills
includes
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
contract,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
that
they
could
do
that
and
the
contract
would
be
valid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
telling
me
which
part
of
the
act
you
specifically
rely
on
--
the
contract
to
specifically
rely
on,
on
there
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
termination
of
the
meaning
of
the
contract
is
arbitrated.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
feller,
may
i
ask
you
on
the
--
regarding
the
contract.
is
the
contract
which
was
in
prior
case
and
which
is
in
this
case
identical?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
true
that
it's
stated
in
the
other
opinion
that
the
union
had
been
trying
to
get
this
particular
clause
in
with
reference
to
contracting
out
and
have
not
been
able
to
get
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
--
is
it
announced
directly,
pragmatically
speaking,
substantially,
what
they
decided
before
was
against
it
although
it
didn't
decide
it
on
the
same
--
they
didn't
refer
to
the
reasons
you
are
now
giving
where
they
can
decide
it
differently?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
first
decision
in
1960.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
they
held
it
was
not
arbitrable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
pretty
fine
distinction,
isn't
it?
