mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
neither
the
parties
nor
the
court
below
were
in
any
disagreement
basically
about
what
this
court
has
held
in
american
manufacturing,
warrior
&
gulf,
and
the
cases
which
followed
it.
certainly,
this
court
has
said
that
it
is
for
the
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
employer
has
promised
to
arbitrate
this
kind
of
grievance.
if
the
court
decides
that
the
employer
has
so
promised,
then
the
court
must
order
arbitration
without
getting
into
the
merits
of
the
grievance.
if
the
court
decides
looking
at
the
contract
that
there
is
no
promise
to
arbitrate
this
kind
of
grievance,
then
the
merits
are
not
reached
either
in
the
court
proceeding
or
in
the
non-existent
arbitration
agreement.
now,
we
submit
that
the
court
in
this
case
did
exactly
that.
a
careful
reading
of
the
court's
opinion
will
show
that
it
stated
those
principles
and
only
those
principles
that
it
considered
the
sole
question
before
it
to
be
whether
or
not
the
company
had
promised
to
arbitrate
this
kind
of
grievance,
and
it
found
that
it
did
not.
now,
we
think
that
where
we
differ
from
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
on
two
points.
one
is
that
the
union
has
said
in
its
brief
that
the
language
of
the
arbitration
provision
in
this
contract,
the
language
which
the
court
below
admittedly
had
to
interpret
to
find
a
promise
to
arbitrate,
the
union
contends
that
this
language
is
indistinguishable
from
the
arbitration
provisions
in
american
manufacturing
and
in
warrior
&
gulf.
the
other
point
at
which
we
differ
is
the
union's
suggestion
that
the
court
below
got
into
the
merits
of
this
grievance.
we
submit
that
the
court
below
did
not.
now,
the
grievance
and
arbitration
provisions
of
this
contract
are
reprinted
in
the
record
on
pages
8
through
14.
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
fact
that
the
access
to
the
grievance
procedure
here
is
exceedingly
broad
essentially
without
limit.
the
article
gets
to
the
arbitration
question
in
section
9
and
it
says
that
if
a
question
is
not
settled
in
the
grievance
procedure,
the
company
or
the
union
may
refer
the
subject
for
arbitration
and
then
it
goes
on
with
some
provisions
for
the
mechanics
of
the
arbitration.
now,
section
10
which
begins
below
the
middle
on
page
11
of
the
transcript
and
occupies
all
of
page
12
is
a
section
which
is
devoted
exclusively
to
limiting
the
scope
of
the
arbitration.
section
10
begins
with
these
words
which
govern
all
of
section
10.
it
says
as
a
specific
limitation
on
the
foregoing
section
9
of
this
article
ii,
the
following
shall
be
effective.
it
then
has
four-lettered
subparts
to
section
2.
now,
part
(a)
begins,
questions
which
may
be
referred
to
arbitration
shall
be
limited
to.
part
(d)
indicates
a
broad
area
of
matters
relating
to
bargaining
subjects
and
says
that
those
which
are
not
covered
by
this
agreement
as
to
them
either
party
shall
be
entitled
to
refuse
to
arbitrate.
now,
this
is
a
very
different
clause
than
the
court
had
to
construe
in
looking
for
a
promise
to
arbitrate
in
american
manufacturing
and
in
warrior
&
gulf.
in
american
manufacturing,
there
was
a
broad
promise
to
arbitrate
and
no
word
of
exclusion
or
limitation
at
all.
in
warrior
&
gulf,
there
was
a
broad
promise
to
arbitrate,
modified
only
by
a
phrase
which
said
that
it
excluded
“matters
which
are
simply
a
function
of
management”.
in
dealing
with
warrior
&
gulf,
this
court
suggested
that
the
breadth
of
the
arbitration
clause
and
the
very
slight
and
very
vague
limitation
thereon
suggested
that
the
court,
that
the
parties
were
much
more
concerned
with
having
the
arbitrator
decide
everything
than
they
were
in
limiting
the
scope
of
his
jurisdiction.
now,
here
with
a
very
slight
arbitration
clause
simply
saying
the
company
or
the
union
may
refer
the
subject
to
arbitration
and
with
almost
a
page
and
a
half
of
limitation
and
exclusion
and
the
expressed
language
may
refuse
to
arbitrate.
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
parties
were
more
concerned
with
limiting
the
scope
of
the
arbitrator's
power.
now,
this
particular
grievance
is
a
grievance
with
respect
to
the
contracting
out
of
work.
we
submit
that
it
is
excluded
from
arbitration
by
section
10
of
article
ii.
we
think
this
is
so
in
two
ways.
we
think
the
clearest
exclusion
is
in
part
(d).
now,
part
(d)
says
that
the
company
will
bargain
with
resurgence,
with
respect
to
certain
matters
and
that
the
company
may
refuse
to
bar
--
may
refuse
to
arbitrate
with
respect
to
any
such
matter.
now,
surely
if
the
subject
of
contracting
out
is
one
of
those
matters,
then
the
parties
have
said
that
the
company
is
entitled
to
refuse
to
arbitrate
with
respect
to
it
and
we
did.
it
was
therefore
for
the
court
and
not
for
the
arbitrator
to
determine
whether
or
not
contracting
out
was
one
of
those
matters.
now,
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
contracting
out
was
a
matter
relating
to
rates
of
pay,
hours
of
employment
and
other
conditions
of
this
employment
--
of
this
--
other
conditions
of
employment
which
are
not
covered
in
this
agreement,
the
court
had
to
look
to
the
agreement
to
see
whether
it
was
covered.
for
if
it
had
not
done
so,
then
the
parties
would
have
lost
the
benefit
of
their
contract
which
excused
them
from
arbitrating
such
matters.
now,
fortunately
in
this
case,
the
court
didn't
have
to
look
all
over
the
agreement
because
the
union
had
said
in
the
grievance
where
it
was
that
it
contended
that
this
matter
was
covered
by
the
contract.
and
it
settled
on
article
i,
section
1
which
is
printed
on
page
8
of
the
transcript.
now,
this
section
is
phrased
almost
exactly
in
the
language
of
section
9
(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
section
9
(a)
which
is
reprinted
in
a
footnote
on
page
30
of
our
brief
provides
that
representatives
selected
by
a
majority
of
the
employees
in
an
appropriate
unit
shall
be
the
exclusive
representatives
of
all
employees
in
such
unit
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
in
respect
to
rates
of
pay,
wages,
hours
of
employment,
or
other
conditions
of
employment.
looking
at
article
i,
section
1
which
is
the
contract
provision,
which
the
union
says
deals
with
the
matter
of
contracting
out,
it
appears
that
is
written
in
the
same
language.
in
other
words,
article
i
simply
says
that
the
company
recognizes
that
the
union
has
the
status
which
is
given
to
it
by
the
statute.
now,
it
is
established
in
this
agreement
that
although
section
1
relates
to
rates
of
pay,
wages,
hours
of
employment,
or
other
conditions
of
employment,
not
all
of
those
things
are
matters
covered
by
this
agreement
because
part
(d)
at
the
bottom
of
page
12
expressly
says
that
some
of
those
things
are
matters
not
covered
by
this
agreement
and
that
each
party
shall
have
the
right
to
refuse
to
arbitrate
--
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
--
any
such
matter.
sir?
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
at
the
bottom
of
page
12.
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
i'm
sorry,
of
the
transcript.
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
now,
the
court,
therefore
had
to
look
at
the
contract
to
see
whether
contracting
out
was
one
of
the
matters
not
covered
by
the
agreement
or
was
one
of
the
matters
covered
by
the
agreement
and
the
court
found
that
it
was
not
one
of
the
matters
covered
by
the
agreement
for
four
reasons.
one
of
course
is
this,
is
the
fact
and
it
is
not
even
slightly
conclusive
that
there
is
no
reference,
no
expressed
reference
to
contracting
out
in
this
agreement.
now
secondly,
there
is
the
fact
which
i
have
just
mentioned
that
the
broad
language
of
the
statute
repeated
in
article
i,
section
1
on
page
8
of
the
transcript
is
not
--
does
not
bring
in
to
the
agreement,
everything
within
that
language
because
part
(d)
of
the
bottom
of
page
12
of
the
transcript
expressly
said
that
it
did
not.
now
third,
the
court
looked
at
the
bargaining
history
and
the
court
found
from
the
bargaining
history
which
is
plain
in
the
transcript
that
the
union
had
repeatedly
sought
as
the
contract
came
up
for
renegotiation
to
have
something
put
in
the
contract
dealing
with
the
matter
of
contracting
out
and
in
bargaining,
the
company
had
refused
and
the
bargain
that
the
parties
made
did
not
put
in
something
on
that
subject.
now,
the
court
said
that
this
bargaining
history
was
not
con
--
not
controlling
but
that
it
fortified
the
conclusion
that
the
plaintiff's
position
was
without
merit.
but
there
was
one
other
fact
which
was
very
important
from
the
view
of
the
court,
and
this
is
something
which
comes
in
to
this
case
in
two
ways.
it
comes
in
to
this
case
in
connection
with
collateral
estoppel
but
that's
not
the
matter
with
which
i
am
dealing
at
this
moment.
this
is
matter
of
the
prior
litigation.
in
1957,
as
mr.
feller
has
said,
there
was
before
the
court
a
grievance
which
was
identical
in
its
language
to
this
one
except
that
the
job
referred
to
was
different.
it
referred
to
crane
--
to
cement
finishing,
this
one
refers
to
crane
operating,
but
it
was
verbatim
the
same
otherwise.
at
that
time,
the
provisions
of
article
i
and
article
ii
of
the
contract
were
verbatim
the
same.
at
that
time,
the
court
had
before
it,
the
question
of
interpreting
the
language
of
the
contract
to
determine
whether
it
contained
a
promise
to
arbitrate
and
contracting
out
grievance
or
whether
or
not
that
was
one
of
the
matters
not
covered
in
this
agreement,
and
in
that
litigation,
the
court
adjudicated
the
meaning
of
this
contract
language.
it
adjudicated
the
fact
that
this
language
did
not
contain,
did
not
mean
a
promise
to
arbitrate
a
contracting
out
grievance.
now,
as
mr.
feller
has
said,
five
months
after
that
decision
adjudicating
the
meaning
of
this
language,
the
parties
entered
into
a
new
contract
using
the
identical
language,
the
meaning
of
which
had
been
adjudicated
between
them.
now,
it
would
seem
inconceivable
that
when
the
parties
put
their
names
to
that
language,
defining
and
limiting
the
obligation
to
arbitrate,
it
would
seem
inconceivable
that
they
did
not
mean
by
that
language
the
meaning
which
the
court
had
just
adjudicated
between
them,
that
language
to
have.
now,
for
this
reason
--
these
reasons,
the
court
concluded
that
contracting
out
was
not
a
matter
which
was
covered
by
this
agreement.
the
contract
expressly
says
that
each
party
shall
have
the
right
to
refuse
to
arbitrate
such
--
any
such
matter.
we
did
refused
and
therefore
the
court
held
that
we
did
not
have
to.
now,
this
does
not
mean
that
the
court
of
appeals
got
into
the
merits
of
the
grievance.
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
no.
it
does
not
--
the
words
contracting
out
are
nowhere
used
in
the
contract.
there
is
no
direct
reference
in
the
contract
to
contracting
out.
but
in
part
(d)
of
article
ii,
section
10
at
the
bottom
of
page
12
--
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
i
find
that
it
says
that
in
this
way.
it
says
that
they
will
submit
to
arbitration
only
matters
relating
to
rates
of
pay,
hours
of
employment,
and
other
conditions
of
employment
which
are
not
covered
in
this
agreement,
and
that
they
need
not
arbitrate
any
such
matters.
now,
this
leaves
the
court
with
the
question
of
discovering
whether
contracting
out
is
one
of
the
rates
of
pay,
hours
of
employment
or
other
conditions
of
employment
which
is
covered
by
this
agreement.
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
well,
i
think
mr.
feller
made
that
argument
and
made
that
orally
here,
that
i
believe
is
contrary
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
for
example
in
john
wiley
&
sons
against
livingston,
drake
bakeries
and
all
of
the
others,
in
all
of
those
cases,
this
court
has
said
that
there
is
a
question
of
interpreting
the
contract
which
is
for
the
court
and
not
the
arbitrator.
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
oh!
oh,
undoubtedly,
the
--
i
do
not
find
there's
--
there's
no
decision
of
this
court
which
says
that
the
parties
could
not
agree
that
the
question
of
arbitrability
rest
before
an
arbitrator.
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
oh!
the
parties
could
agree
to
that
and
they
could
agree
to
it
in
terms
which
would
leave
to
an
arbitrator
and
not
to
the
court
the
question
of
arbitrability.
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
if
they
had
agreed
to
that,
then
you
would
have
--
we
would
have
to
argue
--
arbitrate
the
question
of
arbitrability
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
exactly
and
that
is
the
question
which
this
court
has
said
was
for
the
court,
namely,
looking
at
that
language
of
the
contract
and
interpreting
it
to
see
whether
or
not
it
contains
a
promise
by
the
arbitrator
to
arbitrate
this
kind
of
a
matter.
now,
in
wiley,
in
--
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
i
am
not.
they
could
agree
that
arbitrability
was
for
an
arbitrator.
now,
if
--
if
they
--
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
they
could
agree
--
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
oh!
the
court
would
have
one
thing
left
to
pass
on.
the
court
would
still
have
to
pass
on
the
question
of
whether
the
contract
did
contain
the
agreement
to
which
you
have
just
referred
namely,
if
the
employer
said
in
such
litigation,
“oh
no!
this
contract
does
not
mean
that
we
have
agreed
to
leave
to
an
arbitrator
the
question
of
interpreting
the
arbitration
clause”
--
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
--
then
plainly
--
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
i
think
he
disagrees
with
me
on
that.
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
yes,
i
think
he
disagreed.
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
except
that
if
you
stated
that
that
is
the
issue,
you
never
get
to
really
--
first
of
all,
this
contract
does
not
expressly
say
that.
secondly,
this
contract
--
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
it
does
not.
the
inter
--
the
interpretation
of
the
promise
to
arbitrate
is
like
the
interpretation
of
any
other
provision
of
contract
to
be
arrived
at
by
the
same
meanings.
but
this
contract
at
the
bottom
of
page
12
makes
it
very
clear
that
there
are
some
matters
which
the
parties
may
refuse
to
arbitrate
that
it
does
say
expressly
in
so
many
words.
now,
if
there
are
some
matters
which
the
parties
may
refuse
to
--
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
in
order
to
answer
that
question,
the
court
has
to
interpret
section
10
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
for
either
the
provision
to
which
mr.
feller
referred
is
in
this
agreement
or
it
is
not.
now,
surely
this
court
in
dealing
with
language
which
is
--
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
yes,
but
what
--
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
yes.
perhaps,
i
think
mr.
feller
and
i
disagree
about
what
the
court
has
said
heretofore.
mr.
feller
thinks
the
court
has
said
heretofore,
if
i
do
not
misquote
him,
that
if
the
union
contends
there's
a
violation
of
the
contract,
they
merely
have
to
contend
that
and
they're
entitled
to
get
to
an
arbitrator.
and
we
understand
the
court
to
have
said
before
that
the
court
must
first
determine
whether
there
is
a
promise
to
arbitrate
such
a
contention
and
in
doing
so,
it
must
look
at
the
whole
contract
but
particularly
in
those
parts
of
the
contract
which
do
expressly
limit
the
promise
to
arbitrate
this
contract.
and
therefore,
the
words
of
this
contract
are
important.
that
is
what
the
court
below
was
directed
to
interpret,
by
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
and
this
court,
this
contract
is
just
full
of
an
atmosphere
of
intending
to
limit
the
things
which
are
for
arbitration.
the
parties
devoted
a
page
and
a
half
of
the
transcript
which
means
more
than
a
page
and
a
half
of
the
contract
to
that
very
subject
and
therefore,
plainly
--
they
have
said
this
plainly
as
human
language
will
permit.
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
yes,
i
think
that's
right.
now,
i
would
point
this
and
i
think
this
is
clear.
parts
(a),
(b),
(c),
and
(d)
of
section
10
on
pages
11
and
12
of
the
transcript
are
to
a
degree
independent
parts,
that
is
part
(d)
stands
by
itself.
the
beginning
of
section
10
says
we
are
limiting
the
scope
of
section
9.
part
(a)
says
the
questions
may
be
referred
shall
be
limited
too
but
it
doesn't
go
on
and
say
and
if
you
can
get
within
one
of
these
limits
you're
entitled
to
arbitrate
because
you
still
have
the
hurdle
of
part
(d)
to
get
over
and
part
(d)
is
an
additional
limitation
upon
the
scope
of
arbitration
and
the
power
of
the
arbitrator
here.
part
(d)
approaches
it
from
another
side
and
says
there
are
certain
matters
as
to
which
either
party
shall
have
the
right
to
refuse
to
arbitrate.
now,
it
is
to
be
noted
here
that
the
union
in
this
case
is
not
seeking
to
compel
us
to
arbitrate
the
question
of
arbitratability
before
an
arbitrator.
the
union
here
seeking
--
the
union
here
is
seeking
to
--
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
if
the
union
can
bring
an
action
to
compel
arbitrability,
to
compel
you
to
arbitrate
arbitrability
before
an
arbitrator,
a
union
can
do
that.
i
can
imagine
a
contract
which
would
permit
them
to
prevail
in
such
a
lawsuit
but
this
is
not
such
a
contract
because
this
contract
does
not
say
that.
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
well,
no.
first,
let
me
say,
i
think
that
is
not
a
standard
arbitration
clause
by
itself.
it
is
true
that
most,
but
far
from
all,
collective
bargaining
agreements
contain
language
like
that
but
almost
without
exception.
they
have
some
limiting
language
on
top
of
that.
now
secondly,
i
would
say
that
if
the
contract
said
that
and
no
more,
it
would
still
be
for
the
court
and
not
the
arbitrator
to
determine
the
question
of
arbitrability.
now,
the
court's
decision
in
anything
like
that
is
foregone.
but
the
court
would
not
refer
to
the
arbitrator
the
question
of
arbitrability.
it
would
order
the
parties
to
arbitrate
the
grievance
itself.
this
is
what
happened
in
american
manufacturing.
now,
i
was
saying
that
this
court
in
this
case
did
not
get
to
the
merits.
it
did
not
purport
to
deal
with
the
merits.
to
get
to
the
merits
would
necessarily
have
involved
determining
not
merely
that
the
subject
matter
of
contracting
out
was
a
matter
covered
by
this
agreement
but
it
would
also
necessarily
involve
determining
how
it
was
covered.
in
other
words,
was
contracting
out
permitted,
forbidden?
permitted
under
some
circumstances
which
have
been
satisfied
in
the
facts
of
this
grievance?
forbidden
under
some
circumstances
which
fitted
the
facts
of
this
grievance?
that
would
be
getting
into
the
merits.
that
would
deciding
whether
the
grievance
had
merit
or
not.
what
the
court
here
did
and
properly
did
was
not
to
look
at
that
at
all
but
solely
to
look
to
see
whether
the
subject
of
contracting
out
was
a
matter
which
was
not
covered
in
this
agreement.
now,
i
have
a
--
we
have
this
other
issue
of
collateral
estoppel.
obviously,
if
we
are
successful
on
the
first
issue,
the
issue
of
collateral
estoppel
becomes
moot.
but
let
me
say
this
about
the
issue
of
collateral
estoppel.
the
courts
have
found
its
boundaries
to
very
very
much
depending
upon
the
nature
of
the
issue
before
it.
in
the
sunnen
case
which
was
the
petitioner's
chief
reliance
in
this
matter.
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
with
the
union's
chief
reliance
in
this
matter,
the
thing
which
had
been
adjudicated
in
the
first
case
was
the
meaning
of
a
tax
statute.
and
the
court
essentially
said
that
you
cannot
have
a
taxpayer
who
has
a
perpetual
right
to
pay
taxes
differently
than
other
people
because
he
has
been
once
successful
in
what
has
proven
to
be
an
erroneous
interpretation
of
the
tax
statute.
that
is
one
end
of
the
collateral
estoppel
spectrum.
collective
bargaining
agreements
surely
are
at
the
other
end.
there
is,
or
should
be,
a
national
policy
to
minimize
and
avoid
litigation
over
collective
bargaining
agreements.
now,
if
the
parties
once
litigate
the
meaning
of
particular
language
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
meaning
of
that
language
is
settled,
that
ought
permanently
to
be
settled
between
them.
they
shouldn't
be
able
to
harass
each
other
and
take
up
the
court's
time
with
litigation
and
re-litigation
of
it
for
the
contract
is
going
to
expire
after
a
brief
interval
and
the
parties
are
going
to
have
a
full
opportunity
to
change
that
language
if
they
intend
a
different
meaning.
now,
keeping
unions
and
companies
out
of
court
is
a
primary
reason
why
it
is
that
collateral
estoppel
which
should
be
applied
and
is
applied
on
so
restricted
basis
in
tax
cases
should
be
applied
in
a
very
liberal
basis,
on
collective
bargaining
agreements.
we
think
the
cases
in
our
brief
show
that
it
is
applied
liberally
on
contract
interpretation
questions
generally,
a
fortiori
should
be
so
on
collective
bargaining
agreements.
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
i
think
it
did.
what
happened
--
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
well
--
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
--
yes,
it
did.
what
happened
there
was.
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
makes
it
plain
for
it
says
so
in
so
many
words
in
the
footnote,
that
only
count
one
was
before
it.
it
spelled
that
out
and
it
said
that
the
case
had
been
briefed
and
argued
solely
on
count
one.
and
it
so
decided.
now,
why
its
order
was
in
broader
terms,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
the
entire
order
is
here.
but
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
reversed
as
to
count
two,
and
that
therefore
summary
judgment
was
not
issued
for
the
defendant
on
count
two,
presumably
the
record
on
count
two
would
revert
back
to
its
proper
situation
which
was
that
count
two
was
dismissed
by
the
district
court
and
no
appeal
was
taken
with
respect
to
that
dismissal.
the
trouble
with
the
court
of
appeals
are
on
in
that
respect
is
that
it
entered
an
order
with
respect
to
a
matter
which
wasn't
before
it
and
presumably
that
order
is
void
and
that
the
count
two
remains
as
dead
as
it
was
when
it
was
heard
by
the
district
court.
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
oh!
i
think
not.
now,
first
of
all
--
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
in
your
case
--
your
case
as
stated
leaves
out
the
terms
of
the
promise
to
arbitrate
and
those
are
vital
because
that
is
what
the
court
must
--
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
--
interpret.
if
we
had,
these
--
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
yes.
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
oh!
not
at
all.
well,
the
court
does
under
this
arbitration
clause,
have
to
determine
if
it
in
dispute,
whether
the
thing
to
be
arbitrated
is
a
matter
covered
or
not
covered
in
the
agreement.
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
--
not
which
way
it's
covered,
but
whether
it's
covered.
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
and
that
--
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
yes,
and
that's
only
because
the
parties
so
agreed
in
part
(d).
now,
it
is
notable
that
in
our
case
at
bar,
the
union
did
not
--
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
that
is
right
and
this
is
--
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
oh!
not
at
all,
because
the
court
--
mr.
frederic
d.
anderson
no
sir.
it
might
be
for
example
that
the
contract
would
contain
a
clause
which
would
say
the
company
shall
have
full
right
to
contract
out
any
work.
the
union
might
file
a
grievance
claiming
that
that
clause
was
violated
because
the
company
did
contract
out
work.
now,
the
union
would
be
patently
wrong
but
still,
what
the
court
should
do
under
the
plain
language
of
part
(d)
is
to
look
at
that
clause,
see
that
contracting
out
is
a
matter
covered
by
this
agreement
and
should
order
the
parties
to
arbitrate.
the
arbitrator
would
then
look
to
see
whether
the
contract
forbade
contracting
out
of
work,
and
it
would
find
that
it
not
only
did
not,
but
that
it
expressly
permitted
it.
he
therefore
would
decide
the
grievance
for
the
company.
