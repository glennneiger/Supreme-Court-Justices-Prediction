justice
byron
r.
white
did
i
understand
mr.
feller,
on
the
other
part
of
the
--
on
the
other
part
of
the
case,
the
court's
function,
i
suppose,
is
limited
to
determining
arbitrability.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
would
you
say
that
when
the
union
under
this
contract
claimed
a
violation
of
the
terms
of
the
contract,
that
the
court
has
no
function
at
all
other
than
to
order
arbitration?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
if
the
--
let's
assume
that
the
union
just
can
--
they
admitted,
well
it
will
determine
the
agreement
if
we
claim
it's
arbitrated,
that
we
claim
there
was
a
violation
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
arbitrator
is
the
one
that
ought
to
fill
us
out
and
not
the
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
what
does
the
court
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
the
union
--
what
if
the
court
says
to
the
union
when
it
comes
in
the
court
on
its
complaint
says,
“yes,
i
see
that
you
claim
a
violation,
but
tell
us
what
term
of
the
contract
is
violated”,
do
you
think
that
question
is
out
of
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
union
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
union
tells
the
court
that
it's
none
of
your
business.
we're
just
claiming
a
violation
of
the
contract.
we're
just
claiming
arbitrability
because
that's
what
the
contract
says.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
the
court
ought
to
say
though
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
its
arbitrability
in
the
merits
of
the
grievance
may
be
--
may
involve
the
same
question
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
are
no
--
under
your
approach,
there
are
no
nonarbitrable
matters
if
the
union
just
says
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
or,
or
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
even
say,
don't
use
the
word
violation
in
the
contract,
but
you
could
use
--
you've
got
the
same
argument
with
the
board's
interpretation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
--
but
if
it
says
in
application
or
interpretation
that
leaves
out
the
word
violation,
you
could
make
the
same
argument
as
found
on
those
words.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
this
is
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
this
section
here
with
a
lot
of
waste
of
words
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
terms
of
trying
to
limit,
it
sounds
like
it's
trying
to
limit
the
subject
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
gather
that
--
you
said
the
contract
had
said
the
--
you
will
arbitrate
all
matters
of
interpretation
--
application
or
interpretation
of
the
contract,
period,
without
all
the
language
you've
got
in
this
section
here,
would
you
--
would
you
say
that
the
standard
arbitration
clause
would
leave
us
a
situation
where
the
union
could
get
the
arbitrator
on
the
question
of
arbitrability?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
mr.
anderson,
is
the
--
is
the
cause
really
at
part
two
of
the
complaint
here,
i
guess
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
the
district
court
to
enter
judgment
on
both
counts,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
--
actually,
the
summary
judgment
of
the
district
court
is
related
to
one
count,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
with
the
one
clause
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
would
the
court
of
appeals
go
to
both
clauses?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
order
--
that
--
that
order
--
the
entire
order
is
here
though,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
--
let
me
ask
you.
let's
assume
a
union
comes
to
the
court
and
says,
“we
want
arbitration
and
we
claim
there's
a
violation
of
contract
namely
clause
x
from
the
contract.”
and
the
company
says,
“well,
clause
x
doesn't
relate
to
this
thing
at
all”.
but
you
can
read
it.
the
court
said,
“well,
i
don't
know.
it's
pretty
close.
it
may
not
be.
what
should
i
do?
do
i
interpret
this
clause
or
not?”
do
--
is
that
what
the
court's
supposed
to
do
and
go
right
ahead
and
interpret
that
clause
to
see
if
it
is
--
it
is
--
i
mean
it
has
to
go
on.
if
it
has
to
find
out
whether
their
action
was
about
--
what
they
refer
as
a
bona
fide
claim
as
a
violation,
it
must
go
on
and
interpret
that
clause
of
the
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
put
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
let's
put
in
the
words
that
are
used
here.
the
promise
is
to
--
to
arbitrate
a
claim,
a
violation
of
the
terms
of
its
agreement,
of
the
terms
of
its
agreement.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
union
comes
in
and
said
that,
“the
company
has
violated
clause
x,
a
term
in
this
agreement,
and
we
want
it
arbitrated”.
and
the
company
says,
“that
clause
relates
--
has
no
connection
whatsoever
with
the
subject
matter,
to
this
grievance”
and
the
court
says,
“well,
you
may
claim
it.
but
what
it
looks
pretty
close
to
me,
pretty
close
to
me.
now,
do
i
have
to
get
into
the
--
into
the
--
going
to
the
whole
history
of
this
agreement
and
find
out
what
the
parties
intended
in
this
--
in
this
term
of
the
agreement
or
not?”
now,
if
he
--
i
gather
--
i
gather
in
your
argument,
we
have
to
do
that
in
order
determine
arbitrability.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying.
the
court
has
to
decide
then
when
the
union
said,
“they
violated
clause
x”.
and
your
claim
is
that
we
have
--
the
court
has
to
decide
whether
clause
x
covers
the
subject
matter
of
this
agreement.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
meaning.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
involved
--
this
certainly
involved
the
interpretation
of
a
term
in
the
agreement
and
the
reason
you
say
it's
for
the
court
is
because
you
say
the
arbitration
clause
necessarily
projects
the
court
in
the
business
of
interpreting
the
clauses
of
the
contract
other
than
arbitration
clause.
justice
byron
r.
white
or,
really
is
--
are
you
saying
that
the
court
really
decides
the
grievance
too
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
even
if
the
court
said
--
the
court
said
that
the
term
doesn't
relate
to
it,
the
grievance
is
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if,
mr.
feller,
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
contract
said
in
another
provision,
not
in
the
arbitration
clause,
it
said
the
company
and
the
union
agree
that
the
company
is
perfectly
free
to
contract
out,
period.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
the
arbitration
clause
says
--
we
will
--
we
will
arbitrate
all
kinds
of
violations.
the
company
contracts
out,
you
come
in
and
say
--
say
the
company
had
violated
the
agreement.
justice
byron
r.
white
nevertheless,
it
goes
to
the
arbitrator.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
awhile
ago
you
said
that
you
--
that
you
thought
that
even
if
this
--
even
if
this,
if
clause
i
didn't
have
that
alleged
violation,
you
would
come
up
the
same
way
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
absolutely.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
have
the
same
principle
involved,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
this
means
--
justice
byron
r.
white
does
this
means
that
(inaudible)
only
to
the
union.
the
union
comes
in
and
uses
some
form
of
words,
it
comes
in,
in
one
arbitration
and
uses
the
right
form
of
words,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
in
--
you're
in
control
of
whether
you
--
whether
you
strike
under
(d)
or
whether
you
make
words,
whether
you
would
make
these
arbitrable.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
of
course
it
accomplished
both
ways.
but
assume
that
the
--
if
the
union
comes
in
and
uses
that
form
of
words
and
you
say
it's
arbitrable,
period,
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree,
but
as
long
as
you
will
say
that
a
claim
that
--
that
it's
a
violation
of
the
agreement,
that's
all
the
court
should
look
to.
