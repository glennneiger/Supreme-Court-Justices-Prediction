justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
feller,
may
i
see
if
i
understand
you
well.
let
me
see
if
i
understand
you
accurately,
does
this
go
this
far
for
example
suppose
in
this
instance,
the
employer
had
decided
to
discontinue
this
particular
operation
and
the
union
came
in
and
claim
there
are
decisions
to
discontinue
their
operation,
completely,
is
a
violation
of
the
agreement
although
there's
absolutely
nothing
in
the
agreement
at
all
--
on
its
face,
in
this
company.
nevertheless,
it's
your
position
that
even
in
that
instance,
all
the
court's
powers
can't
do
anything
but
order
arbitration
and
leave
to
the
arbitrator
the
decision
whether
discontinuance
of
that
operation
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
suppose
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
an
automobile
manufacturer
and
the
union
says,
the
manufacturer
decides
it's
going
to
introduce
a
new
model
of
automobile
and
the
union
comes
in
and
objects
on
the
ground
that
the
introduction
of
the
new
model
is
a
violation
of
the
agreement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
arbitrated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
do
i
understand
mr.
feller
that
this
contract
has
some
limitations
to
wages,
hours,
and
working
conditions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i'm
just
wondering
mr.
feller,
what
consequences
(d)
under
your
interpretation
of
(a)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
if
the
union
said
--
this
certainly
seems
to
exclude
things
not
covered
from
the
agreement
from
arbitration
but
if
the
union
says
as
i
understand
you,
in
(d)
it
is
a
violation
of
the
agreement
then
the
court
can
do
nothing
but
order
arbitration.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
why
is
it
(inaudible)
to
go
so
far
as
to
--
refer
the
alleged
violation
to
the
recognition
clause.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why?
why
did
you
have
to
do
that
on
your
premise?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know.
but
for
this
purpose
you'd
be
making
the
same
argument
if
you
limited
the
whole
thing
to
what's
in
(a)
(1)
of
section
10
namely,
you
come
in
and
said,
“this
effort
to
contract
out,
we
allege
violates
the
terms
of
the
agreement”,
period.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
don't
have
to
identify
any
terms
of
the
agreement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
means
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
ask
you
another
question
mr.
feller.
this
is
really
a
decision
for
this
face
of
this
contract
alone,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
and
--
whether
it
is
not,
in
any
event,
your
whole
argument
is
predicated
on
this
specific
provision,
(a)
(1)
that
they
are
arbitrable
“alleged
violations
in
terms
of
this
agreement”,
period.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
that
--
the
other
point
i
was
trying
to
get
to
is
however
we
decide
this,
the
next
contract
doesn't
have
that
language
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean,
we're
not
going
to
answer
it?
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
--
do
you
consider
(inaudible)
has
bearing
on
what
the
arbitrator
must
decide,
namely
these
exclusions
totally
go
to
whether
indeed
there
was
a
violation
by
company
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
wait
a
minute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
feller,
i
just
want
to
get
your
position
as
to
10
(d).
if
you're
going
to
give
(a)
(1)
the
scope
you
--
you
do
get
in,
then
what
is
there
in
(d)
on
your
premise
except
as
governing
what
the
arbitrator
may
finally
decide
as
to
the
arbitrability
of
this
particular
grievance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
you
say
that's
all
the
court
can
look
to
and
i
suggest
again
mr.
feller,
your
position
must
be
that
10
is
relevant
only
to
what
the
arbitrator
does,
not
the
what
(d)
is
relevant
only
to
what
the
arbitrator
does
and
not
know
what
(d)
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
what
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
on
--
when
you
walked
in
and
you
asked
the
court
to
order
arbitration
on
the
basis
of
the
alleged
violation
of
the
agreement,
you
are
saying
that
the
court
can't
look
at
10
(d),
aren't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then,
if
it
has
any
significance
for
anybody
in
connection
with
the
grievance,
it
may
have
only
for
the
arbitrator
(voice
