mr.
samuel
h.
burr
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
petition
for
certiorari
from
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
it
presents
one
single
but
we
feel
a
very
important
question
of
law
involving
industrial
relations
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
that
question
is
simply
this
that
the
person
asserting
a
claim
for
severance
pay
based
solely
on
the
provisions
of
a
collective
bargaining
contract
governed
by
the
labor
management
relations
act
as
amended
have
to
exhaust
the
binding
grievance
arbitration
procedure
provided
for
in
the
contract
before
he
can
sue
in
a
court
of
law
an
effort
to
enforce
his
claim.
all
of
the
alabama
courts
below
held
that
he
was
not
required
to
exhaust
these
administrative
or
grievance
and
arbitration
procedures.
we
feel
that
this
holding
was
fairly
erroneous
and
contrary
to
the
controlling
federal
substantive
law
enunciated
by
this
court
since
the
lincoln
mills
decision.
at
the
outset
i
think
it
might
be
well
for
me
to
state
that
this
is
not
a
case
like
that
in
humphrey
versus
moore
where
the
individual
claimant
might
assert
that
he
was
unable
to
have
a
fair
determination
of
his
trial
under
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
because
of
some
conflict
--
conflicting
interest
on
the
part
of
his
union
or
some
connivance
on
the
part
of
the
union
and
the
employer.
the
complaint
contains
no
allegation
that
the
respondent
ever
requested
his
union
to
even
invoke
the
arbitration
and
grievance
procedure
in
this
case.
it
was
--
it
has
been
simply
the
respondent's
position
throughout
this
litigation
that
under
the
alabama
law
that
he
was
not
required
to
resort
to
the
grievance
arbitration
procedure
before
suing
in
court.
the
facts
are
relatively
undisputed
and
in
--
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they've
quoted
by
stipulation
of
facts
which
we
entered
into
in
order
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
a
lengthy
trial
so
that
this
matter
could
be
presented
as
a
question
of
law
and
decided
properly
for
the
courts
of
alabama.
first,
i
like
to
point
out
that
the
labor
contract
in
this
case
was
between
the
petitioner
and
the
exclusive
bargaining
agent
of
the
respondent
and
covered
two
mines
located
in
jefferson
county,
alabama,
spaulding
and
edwards
mines.
it
was
in
the
usual
form
and
was
very
comprehensive
in
nature,
covering
every
phase
of
the
employment
relationship.
petitioner
was
admittedly
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
in
that
contract
was
section
14
which
set
out
a
severance
or
separation
pay
provision.
this
particular
provision
was
of
the
conditional
type.
that
is
a
person
was
entitled
a
separation
pay
only
upon
a
determination
that
the
man
or
a
substantial
portion
of
the
man,
a
plant
where
he
worked
was
closed
down
permanently
within
the
meaning
of
that
particular
contract.
he
was
not
entitled
to
separation
pay
because
of
layoffs
for
economic
reasons,
automation
or
lack
of
hours
or
lack
of
business.
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
no
sir,
none
whatsoever.
the
severance
pay
provision
is
purely
a
creature
of
this
contract
that
the
--
but
--
that
the
respondent
is
suing
upon.
that
same
contract
--
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
out
of
the
contract.
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
yes
sir.
he
--
there's
no
other
possible
basis
for
his
claim
for
severance
pay.
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
i
do
not
think
so.
i
think
in
the
case
for
wrongful
discharge
under
the
labor
management
relations
act,
the
result
would
be
the
same.
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
reach
that
issue
in
this
particular
case.
in
the
same
contract
was
section
--
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
if
the
suit
were
by
the
union,
i
believe
it
would
--
is
necessary
for
the
union,
the
employee
and
the
company
alike
to
exhaust
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
where
the
parties
have
agreed
to
put
such
a
procedure
which
leads
to
binding
arbitration
in
the
contract
itself.
i
believe
the
union
could
bring
a
suit
for
a
specific
performance
to
make
the
employer
handle
the
matter
through
the
arbitration
procedure.
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
no,
i
think
the
--
this
--
it
really
--
it
is
out
because
the
decision
is
binding.
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
i
agree
with
that
statement.
i
like
to
point
out
that
the
arbitration
clause
in
this
case
is
very
broad.
it's
in
more
or
less
the
standard
phraseology,
it
provides
for
the
three
grievance
steps
followed
by
binding
arbitration.
there
is
--
there
is
even
a
provision
that
says
in
the
interest
of
expeditious
handling
of
a
claim
under
this
contract
that
the
parties
can
agree
on
other
types
of
procedure
under
the
contract
for
the
hearing
of
the
grievance.
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
provision
is
very
broad
covering
any
differences
arising
between
the
company
and
the
union
as
to
the
interpretation
or
application
of
our
compliance
with
the
provisions
of
this
agreement
or
as
to
any
question
relating
to
wages,
hours
of
work,
other
conditions
of
employment
of
any
employee.
a
complaint
of
any
employee
--
any
complaint
of
an
employee
is
first
attempted
to
be
settled
with
his
foreman,
if
it's
not
settled,
then
--
and
that
--
then
it
goes
into
the
grievance
steps.
i
might
also
point
out
that
there's
no
provision
whatsoever
as
was
true
in
the
independent
petroleum
workers
case
now
pending
before
this
court
which
attempted
to
withdraw
any
particular
appeal
from
the
arbitration
coverage.
that
brings
me
to
the
facts
of
the
layoff
of
this
petition.
on
december
16th,
1953,
the
respondent
was
laid
off
from
active
work,
an
enforced
reduction.
at
that
time
under
the
stipulation
of
facts,
a
dispute
existed
as
to
whether
this
layoff
was
due
to
a
permanent
closing
of
the
mines
or
the
portion
of
the
mines
where
he
worked.
as
i
said,
the
respondent
made
no
effort
whatsoever
to
exhaust
the
administrative
grievance
or
grievance
procedure.
instead,
he
waited
some
two
years
and
seven
months
after
the
time
of
his
layoff
and
filed
a
suit
in
the
circuit
court
of
jefferson
county
claiming
severance
pay.
when
the
case
came
on
for
trial,
this
court
had
decided
the
lincoln
mills
case.
other
federal
courts
had
intimated
that
this
was
a
question
of
federal
law
that
favored
the
enforceability
of
arbitration,
provisions
and
labor
contracts.
so,
we
defended
the
case
on
the
grounds
that
the
respondent
had
failed
to
invoke
or
to
exhaust
the
grievance
remedies.
in
this
connection
i
think
it
would
be
fair
to
point
out
that
the
respondent
in
his
brief
in
this
court
for
the
first
time
argues
that
the
severance
pay
claim
was
not
contemplated
by
the
parties
as
being
subject
to
the
grievance
procedure
suggesting
in
support
of
this
argument
that
the
respondent
could
not
have
filed
his
claim
within
30
days
after
the
date
of
his
layoff
because
of
the
absence
of
any
foreman,
a
mine
committeeman
at
the
plant
that
he
worked.
we
must
go
outside
of
the
record
to
answer
that.
as
a
matter
of
actual
fact,
the
mine
committee
was
there.
the
contract
continued
into
operation
for
months
after
the
plaintiff's
layoff
until
this
particular
union
was
succeeded
by
a
successor
union,
a
new
contract
was
negotiated
with
substantially
the
same
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure
in
the
same
severance
pay
procedure.
the
trial
court
rejected
our
defense.
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
alabama
and
while
the
case
was
pending
there,
this
court
decided
the
steelworkers
trilogy
in
june
of
1960.
we
call
these
important
cases
to
the
attention
of
the
court
of
appeals,
our
intermediate
appellate
court
in
alabama.
nevertheless,
that
court
took
the
position
based
on
two
prior
alabama
supreme
court
cases
primarily,
tci
versus
sizemore
and
woodward
iron
company
versus
stringfellow
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
plaintiff
to
exhaust
the
administrative
remedies.
neither
of
these
cases
considered
the
import
of
the
lincoln
mills'
holding
that
a
new
field
of
federal
law
was
being
fashioned
which
governed
this
matter.
vaguely
significant
that
the
sizemore
case
relied
on
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
based
on
the
same
common
law
rule
developed
in
the
commercial
arbitration
field
that
this
court
deemed
inconsistent
with
the
congressional
policy
found
in
the
labor
of
management
relations
act.
when
the
case
reached
the
alabama
supreme
court
that
court
felt
constrained
to
recognize
the
existence
of
the
federal
law,
in
my
opinion.
nevertheless,
it
believed
that
under
the
federal
law,
it
was
still
free
to
carve
out
from
the
general
doctrine,
favoring
the
enforceability
of
agreements
to
arbitrate
in
labor
contracts.
certain
facts
of
claims
like
the
severance
pay
claim
in
this
case
where
the
individual
claimant
was
no
longer
employed
actively
by
the
company
and
where
he
was
not
seeking
reinstatement.
this
type
of
reasoning
would
cover
the
severance
pay
claims.
we
think
it
would
cover
wrongful
discharge
claims.
it
would
cover
claims
for
back
pay
brought
by
retired
or
resigned
employees
or
terminated
employees.
we
feel
that
in
making
this
distinction,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
first
reached
over
in
the
railway
labor
field
to
take
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
moore
versus
illinois
and
twa
versus
koppal
and
apply
that
to
the
industrial
field
under
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
then
misconstrued
the
holdings
of
this
court
to
reach
that
result.
we
feel
the
--
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
no
sir.
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
that
is
the
stipulation
that
there
was
no
effort
made
to
attempt
to
get
relief
through
the
union
either
by
him
or
his
union.
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
no
sir,
it's
not
akin
to
the
situation
in
humphrey
versus
moore
whatsoever.
we
feel
that
the
true
distinction
and
the
touchstone
for
proper
decision
in
this
case
is
not
the
fortuitous
status
of
the
claimants
employment
relationship
when
he
brings
his
suit,
but
is
the
determination
of
whether
the
contracting
parties
to
the
agreement
upon
which
the
claimant
relies
exclusively
intended
the
subject
matter
of
the
claim
to
be
within
the
scope
of
agreements
and
arbitration
procedure.
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
court
has
virtually
decided
this
case
in
the
lincoln
mills
line
of
decisions
under
the
labor
management
relations
act.
first,
it's
certainly
clear
that
there's
now
one
uniform
body
of
federal
substantive
law.
this
point
has
been
so
well
established
in
lucas
flour
and
smith
versus
evening
news.
in
other
decisions,
it
seems
unnecessary
to
argue
the
point.
but
it
is
interesting
to
me
that
these
very
decisions
point
out
and
emphasize
the
necessity
of
a
uniformity
of
decisions
that
you
obtain
by
using
the
proper
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure.
the
lucas
flour
opinion
for
example
points
out
the
possibility
that
individual
contract
terms
may
have
different
meanings
on
a
conflicting
state
and
federal
law.
it
points
out
the
desirability
of
adjusting
claims
under
the
agreed
upon
procedure
as
a
part
of
collective
bargaining
itself.
now,
we
can
--
i
believe
anyone
can
readily
visualize
the
disruptive
results
on
the
collective
bargaining
process.
if
for
example,
various
claimants
similarly
situated
in
claiming
severance
pay
under
the
same
labor
contract
and
perhaps
in
state
--
in
different
jurisdictions
because
these
contracts
cover
more
than
one
state
very
often,
are
allowed
to
bring
different
suits
before
different
courts,
different
juries.
i
think
it's
obvious
that
this
would
have
a
very
disruptive
and
disadvantage
--
disadvantageous
effect
on
the
collective
bargaining
contracts.
it
would
certainly
in
our
opinion
discourage
employers
who
are
willing
now
to
include
severance
pay
and
separation
pay
provision
in
their
contract
if
the
employers
are
going
to
be
denied
the
right
to
have
matters
involving
those
provisions
determined
under
the
agreed
upon
--
by
the
agreed
upon
tribunal
as
a
result
of
conflicting
state
law.
the
decisions
under
the
one
body
of
uniform
federal
law
decided
by
this
court
certainly
favor
the
full
enforceability
of
coll
--
of
arbitration
provisions.
this
--
the
basic
foundation
for
this
principle
is
found
in
section
203
(d)
of
the
act
itself
which
provides
that
the
final
adjustment
by
a
method
agreed
upon
by
the
parties
is
determined
desirable
under
the
act.
the
steelworkers
trilogy
has
set
out
definitely
that
this
is
proper
under
the
federal
scheme
of
things
and
they
say
that
you
should
not
exclude
as
we
read
those
decisions
from
the
coverage
of
the
arbitration
provision,
any
matter
involving
the
contract
unless
positive
assurance
can
be
found
that
the
arbitration
clause
is
not
susceptible
of
an
interpretation
covering
the
asserted
dispute.
the
broad
scope
of
this
doctrine
has
been
enunciated
further
in
the
drake
case,
in
the
needham
case,
in
john
wiley
versus
livingston
case
whereas
a
matter
of
fact
the
court
mentioned
that
typically
included
in
collective
bargaining
agreements
or
such
matters
as
seniority
status
and
severance
pay,
the
very
type
of
claim
in
this
case.
here
again,
the
unanimous
opinion
of
this
court
said
that
the
matter
was
going
by
federal
law,
not
conflicting
state
law.
it
emphasized
again
the
central
and
primary
role
of
the
arbitration
process.
it
mentioned
that
the
agreement
covered
the
entire
employment
relation
and
stated
that
an
employer
would
have
to
arbitrate
under
an
expired
contract
as
i
remember
the
case
where
the
plant
involved
had
been
closed
down
after
a
consolidation
of
merger
or
merger
of
the
employer
involved
by
another
company.
we
believe
very
strongly
that
all
of
the
reasons
set
out
in
those
cases
favoring
the
arbitration,
the
full
enforceability
of
the
arbitration
process
fully
apply
to
a
severance
pay
claim,
the
desirability
of
uniform
results,
the
ex
--
the
expertise
available
under
the
arbitration
process,
the
statutory
right
of
the
union
to
participate
properly
in
the
adjustment
of
grievances,
and
a
prompt
and
expeditious
disposition
of
these
claims.
incidentally,
the
contract
itself
provided
for
appropriate
time
limits
for
the
filing
of
agreements
and
between
the
grievance
steps.
the
severance
pay
claim
by
nature
we
believe
is
particularly
suited
to
be
held
under
the
arbitration
machinery.
for
instance,
one
of
those
items
that
is
subject
to
good
faith
bargaining
like
any
other
condition
of
employment,
it
is
solely
a
breach
of
contract.
it's
like
any
other
monetary
claim
based
on
the
contract.
in
essence,
it
is
just
a
form
of
deferred
payment
paid
to
an
employee
in
return
for
work
performed
under
the
contract.
it
is
specifically
set
out
in
the
contract
and
one
clause
at
section
14,
the
severance
pay
and
section
10
is
the
arbitration
provision.
certainly,
the
party
has
intended
that
this
matter
be
determined
under
the
agreed
upon
tribunal.
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
no
sir.
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
as
a
matter
of
fact
some
claims
were
submitted
under
the
arbitrary
--
under
the
grievance
procedure
after
december
1953
and
was
submitted
to
arbitration.
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
arising
from
this
and
previous
instances
also.
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
i
honestly
don't
know.
i
really
don't
know.
we
--
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
we
can
only
assume
this
mr.
justice
white.
the
grievance
in
this
case
was
a
grievance
committeeman
who
had
participated
in
a
previous
arbitration
involving
the
same
subject
matter
which
related
to
a
previous
layoff
of
the
underground
portion
of
the
mine
and
the
arbitrator
in
that
case
mr.
(inaudible)
washington
determined
that
the
employees
involved
were
not
entitled
to
severance
pay
because
it
was
not
a
--
that
the
employment
was
not
terminated
within
the
meaning
of
the
section
14.
and
no,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
intimates
why
the
claimant
in
this
case
did
not
attempt
to
exhaust
the
administrative
remedies.
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
or
the
union,
yes
sir.
we
feel
certainly
that
the
obligation
to
exhaust
the
administrative
remedies
applies
to
the
employee
as
well
as
to
the
union
and
the
employer.
we
feel
in
the
interest
of
a
fair
policy
under
the
uniform
federal
law
arbitration
must
work
both
ways.
it
cannot
be
a
one
way
street.
if
it
is
favored
by
public
policy
when
one
party
demands
it
then
at
the
same
time,
we
believe
that
is
--
that
the
same
public
policy
favors
it
and
that
the
employer
in
this
case
can
defend
on
a
basis
that
the
grievance
with
machinery
has
not
been
followed.
we
believe
actually
the
court
has
recognized
this
by
a
footnote
to
the
decision
of
smith
versus
evening
news
which
it
mentioned
in
upholding
the
concurrent
jurisdictions
to
entertain
a
301
type
suit
that
in
the
case
in
smith
there
was
no
grievance
arbitration
procedure
on
the
contract
which
had
to
be
exhausted
before
result
could
be
had
to
the
courts.
and
following
the
import
of
the
supreme
court
cases
from
lincoln
mills
through
the
trilogy
to
drake,
the
second
circuit
for
example
has
held
that
former
employees
could
not
bring
suit
for
wrongful
discharge
and
a
suit
governed
by
the
labor
management
relations
act
without
seeking
to
obtain
redressed
through
the
grievance
arbitration
procedure.
the
same
result
has
been
followed,
had
been
reached
by
the
fourth
circuit
in
henderson
versus
eastern
gas
and
fuel
company
cited
in
our
brief.
we
believe
those
decisions
to
be
proper.
this
brings
me
to
my
final
thought
of
my
argument
which
relates
to
the
railway
labor
act
cases
upon
which
we
feel
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
erroneously
relied.
first
place,
we
believe
an
excellent
argument
could
now
be
made
at
the
holdings
in
moore
versus
illinois
central
and
twa
versus
koppal
which
were
writs
and
cases
where
a
federal
jurisdiction
was
based
on
diversity
of
citizenship
have
now
been
perhaps
overruled
although
it's
not
necessary
to
reach
that
point
in
this
case
at
least
we
believe
in
the
proper
case,
those
cases
will
have
to
be
reexamined.
the
result
seems
implicit
in
the
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
iam
versus
central
airlines,
an
action
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
in
which
it
was
held
that
federal
and
not
state
law
controls
in
connection
with
matters
involving
the
enforcement
and
interpretation
of
collective
bargaining
contracts.
it's
interesting
to
know
that
the
court
there
cited
the
lucas
flour
case
decided
under
the
labor
management
relations
act
on
the
point
that
the
subject
matter
manifestly
call
for
uniformity.
certainly,
the
moore
doctrine
should
be
examined
--
it
should
be
reexamined
and
certainly,
we
feel
that
the
--
that
a
divergence
of
results
bearing
from
state
to
state
previously
true
at
least
under
the
railway
labor
act
is
completely
inconsistent
with
the
policy
of
this
court
established
under
the
labor
management
relations
act.
just
for
example,
the
second
court
--
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
two
cases
has
declined
to
follow
the
moore
doctrine
in
a
wrongful
discharge
cases
even
under
the
railway
labor
act,
the
larsen
case
and
the
satterfield
cases
cited
in
our
brief.
the
first
of
which
cited
the
national
labor
policy
developed
under
the
labor
management
relations
act
in
recent
years
and
the
second
relying
on
the
later
decision
of
this
court
in
pennsylvania
railroad
versus
day.
in
addition,
they
--
both
in
decision
in
mississippi
which
involved
the
same
law
interpreted
in
moore
versus
illinois
as
refused
to
follow
at
this
date,
moore
versus
--
the
doctrine
of
moore
versus
illinois
in
view
of
the
later
decisions
of
this
court.
on
the
other
hand,
just
last
thursday,
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
in
mcdonald
versus
the
chicago
and
milwaukee
railroad
did
follow
moore
versus
illinois
but
said
that
in
--
that
instance
moore
versus
illinois
should
be
limited
specifically
to
the
cause
of
action
there
presented
a
wrongful
discharge
case.
and
i
think
the
theory
there
was
it
perhaps
in
a
wrongful
discharge
case
that
the
claimant
may
have
other
items
of
injury
or
other
items
of
damage
which
he
cannot
find
for
redress
or
on
the
arbitration
procedure.
certainly,
this
is
not
true
here.
under
the
arbitration
procedure,
if
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
severance
pay,
it's
spelled
out
exactly
what
he
gets.
there
is
no
other
thing
like
damages
for
lawsuit,
seniority
rights,
insurance,
or
pension
rights.
finally,
in
pennsylvania
railroad
versus
day
the
court
here
has
severely
restricted
the
application
of
moore
versus
illinois
to
the
unusual
and
specific
situation
of
wrongful
discharge.
in
the
slocum
enterprise
cases
the
court
has
justified
the
continued
existence
of
the
moore
doctrine
on
the
basis
of
the
special
nature
of
a
common
law
or
statutory
right
for
wrongful
discharge.
as
i've
said,
feeling
that
perhaps
in
those
cases,
there
might
be
a
different
type
of
remedy
and
a
different
type
of
damages
not
available
under
the
administrative
process.
this
is
certainly
not
true
in
the
instant
case.
also,
i
think
it's
interesting
to
point
out
that
in
the
instant
case,
the
decision
of
the
arbitrator
is
found
and
binding
on
all
parties
and
i
think
the
moore
versus
illinois
central
doctrine
may
have
been
influenced
by
the
beating
of
the
court
that
a
decision
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
was
not
binding
and
so
far
as
the
money
award
was
concerned
on
the
railroad.
and
so,
they
said
it's
not
unfair
to
say
that
the
employee
can
go
to
court.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
central
airline
case
which
involved
the
question
of
a
system
board
award
which
was
found
then
binding
is
more
analogous
to
the
instant
situation.
in
any
event,
we
respectively
submit
that
there's
no
need
to
expand
this
doctrine
which
is
already
severely
limited
in
its
own
field
to
the
labor
management
relations
act
field
and
particularly
in
view
of
the
clear
cases
in
--
favoring
the
full
enforceability
of
arbitration
provisions.
the
conclusion,
i
just
like
to
point
out
that
we
feel
that
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
fell
into
error
because
it
had
a
too
narrow
concept
of
the
entire
collective
bargaining
process.
it
did
not
consider
the
role
of
arbitration
as
an
essential
part
of
the
entire
collective
bargaining
process.
we
feel
that
the
plaintiff
here
in
this
case
has
attempted
to
obtain
the
benefits
of
the
contract
while
rejecting
the
burdens
of
the
contract.
and
as
justice
brandeis
said
in
one
of
the
earliest
cases
involving
the
arbitration
field
where
parties
have
agreed
on
arbitration,
i
think
this
was
the
red
cross
case
that
the
substantive
right
of
the
parties
to
have
that
matter
arbitrated,
the
disputes
under
that
contract
arbitrated
is
a
perfect
obligation.
if
the
policy
of
the
law
governing
the
contract
favors
that
right,
we
feel
the
intent
of
the
parties
should
be
followed.
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
yes
sir,
it's
correct.
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
i
believe
so.
i
think
perhaps
that
if
he
alleged
that
it
was
impossible
because
of
a
(inaudible)
part
of
a
--
the
union
and
the
company
and
because
of
some
conflict
of
interest
on
the
part
of
the
union
which
would
keep
him
from
having
a
proper
determination
of
his
claim
under
the
arbitration
procedure
that
that
might
--
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
well,
i
think
these
remedies
should
be
to
the
union
in
that
case,
i
think.
it's
perhaps
a
situation
where
he's
not
had
a
fair
representation
and
perhaps
the
statutory
duty
of
the
union
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
i
don't
follow
that
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
no
sir
because
we
didn't
think
he
was
entitled
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
that's
correct.
the
employee
had
been
laid
off.
we
felt
the
layoff
did
not
--
was
not
under
such
circumstances
to
entitle
the
--
entitle
him
to
a
severance
pay
claim
because
the
plant
had
not
been
permanently
discontinued
on
the
portion
of
the
mine
where
he
was
working
on.
we
build
the
issue
on
the
merits
and
so
far
as
that
question
is
concerned
is
one
which
the
arbitrator
should
be
found.
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
yes
sir,
we
had.
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
no
sir,
it
is
not,
he
did
some
black
copies
of
it
i
think.
that
in
fact
there
were
two
--
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
the
woodward
iron
company
versus
stringfellow
case
was
as
i
recalled
a
wrongful
discharge
case
brought
and
was
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
stringfellow
case
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
held
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
person
who
allegedly
had
been
wrongfully
discharged
to
exhaust
the
administrative
remedies.
mr.
samuel
h.
burr
yes
sir.
thank
you.
