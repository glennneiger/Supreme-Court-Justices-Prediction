mr.
richard
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
use
the
question
asked
by
justice
white
as
the
springboard
for
what
i
have
to
say
and
let
me
say
it
parenthetically
this
first
talk.
we
represent
charlie
maddox.
i'll
make
that
clear
for
this
reason.
we
do
--
we're
not
here
representing
the
union,
in
fact
the
union
has
appeared
here,
amicus
curiae
with
the
petition
and
i
said
kiddingly
to
my
associate
as
we
drove
up
that
if
this
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
it
--
yes,
its
here,
verified
in
the
brief.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
no
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
no
sir.
i'm
--
i'm
glad
you
made
that
clear.
i
didn't
mean
to
infer
that.
the
union,
the
afl-cio
states
their
position
in
this
amicus
curiae
but
it's
not
the
same
union,
this
was
milk
workers.
in
this
particular
case,
i
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
right.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
right.
i
said,
kidding
unless
rubs
on
the
way
up
that
if
this
was
a
301
case,
it
wouldn't
have
to
fall,
we
never
heard
of
301
when
we
filed
this
lawsuit
sitting
there
in
our
office
trying
to
--
obtained
delayed
birth
certificates
and
released
garnishment.
we
just
hadn't
gotten
into
the
labor
field
very
much
but
we
are
available
to
people
who
walk
in
our
door,
house
and
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
we
represent
this
individual.
we
brought
him
to
some
seduction,
suit
on
contract.
he
said
in
the
contract
that
if
they'd
laid
him
off,
they'd
pay
him
severance
pay.
they
laid
him
off
and
didn't
pay
him
severance
pay.
two
years
have
gone
by.
he
lost
his
seniority
rights
and
couldn't
get
rehired.
he
sued
on
the
contract
for
his
money
--
for
his
money.
there's
an
anomaly
involved
here.
you
got
a
lot
of
--
you've
got
a
lot
of
cases
coming
up
here
from
alabama.
but
let
me
say
this,
this
is
different.
this
is
not
one
of
those
cases
where
you
go
appeal
some
impelling
reasons
to
set
them
straight
by
something
in
my
opinion.
i
think
here
for
once,
it
would
be
terribly
ironic
but
if
you
decide
they
were
wrong
because
this
is
the
--
before
reaching
this
is
that
progressive
type
of
decision
as
opposed
to
those
that
you
have
reviewed
so
many
times
and
rightly
so.
here
you
have
the
state
of
alabama
say
in
this
court,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
saying
that
here
is
a
public
policy
which
we
will
enforce
as
a
matter
of
state
law
that
leaves
the
courthouse
door
open
to
this
man
to
go
in
and
sue
for
a
severance
pay.
now,
that's
a
pretty
good
decision,
not
a
pretty
good
law.
and
let's
boil
this
thing
down
to
its
essentials
or
saying
what
is
the
issue
here?
what
are
we
talking
about?
the
--
in
further
answer
to
justice
white's
question,
the
people
who
brought
this
action,
who
brought
this
grievance
holding
up
for
a
30-day
limit
was
waived
not
--
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
about
those
folks.
but
i
do
know
this,
at
the
instant,
if
you
would
ask
him
the
further
question,
how
did
they
come
out?
nonetheless
though,
i'm
not
trying
to
get
beyond
the
record.
let's
talk
about
the
inevitable
situation
as
preempted.
let's
talk
about
the
inherency
of
the
dangers
involved.
he's
got
a
right
for
reemployment
under
this
contract
within
two
years.
does
he
want
severance
paid?
does
he
want
his
$694
or
does
he
want
to
work?
he's
never
done
anything
in
his
life
but
go
in
this
mine
and
work
at
the
mine.
and
that
was
in
30
days,
he
had
burdened
with
the
decision
of
deciding
whether
he
wants
to
get
$694
or
whether
he
wants
to
wait
out
another
job.
now
that's
some
decisions
to
put
on
immediately.
statute
of
limitations
in
alabama
with
contract
six
years,
why?
why
such
a
long
period?
i
remember
six
years
as
opposed
to
30
days
under
this,
because
the
very
breach
of
the
contract
is
in
a
nebulous
area.
has
it
been
breached?
when
he
got
back
there
that
next
morning,
there
one
--
there
was
no
sign
written
up
over
that
mine
door
that
says
this
mine
is
permanently
closed
by
decision
of
--
by
the
decision
of
the
republic
state.
he
didn't
find
that.
in
fact,
they
told
him
what?
and
defended
on
it
and
defended
on
both
the
arbitrator
many
months
later.
they
hadn't
told
it
yet.
now
what
are
his
rights?
he
can't
win
for
losing.
he
hadn't
got
a
foreman.
the
mine
closed,
no
foreman,
no
fellow
employees,
30
days
now
to
make
his
complaint.
if
that
complaint
made
within
30
days
is
not
satisfied,
then
he
goes
to
the
first
step
of
grievance
with
fellow
employees.
what
fellow
employees?
the
mine
is
closed.
does
any
wonder
that
there
might
be
some
slim
area
of
liberality
even
in
the
alabama
courts
that
respect
this
whole
situation?
mr.
richard
l.
jones
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
this
is
an
option
which
he
must
take.
that's
important
too
because
this
becomes
an
election
which
waives
right
of
emp
--
for
reemployment.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
richard
l.
jones
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
we
included
it
in
our
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
i
may
--
i
may
be
in
error.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
i
may
be
in
error
with
respect
to
the
two
years.
i
believe
though
and
i
cannot
point
to
it
immediately
that
on
the
other
provisions
of
seniority,
that
we
do
have
a
two-year
provision.
i
may
about
--
i
may
be
confusing
this
with
the
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
right.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
right.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
they
received
letters
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
they
received
letters
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
they
received
letters
telling
them
that
they
had
appeared
at
time
but
i
remember
its
being
two
years
in
which
they
could
--
will
remain
on
the
employment
roles
and
could
go
in
according
to
the
seniority
to
other
jobs
and
other
parts
of
the
mines
or
plains.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
if
i
said
they
were,
i
might
be
mistaken
about
that.
but
at
any
--
but
it
--
at
any
rate,
the
time
in
which
he
has
to
wait
out
even
a
six
months
period
seems
to
me
to
be
an
important
right
under
the
contract.
what
is
the
benefit
of
$694
as
compared
to
continuing
employment
and
if
he
waited
that
out,
then
doesn't
he
risk
losing
both
because
having
waited
beyond
the
30
days,
he
wouldn't
have
that
available
to
them
make
his
complaint
and
make
a
grievance
for
severance
pay.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
right.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
now
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
but
the
importance
of
the
complete
severance
is
this
that
once
he
has
elected
to
take
severance
pay,
once
he's
made
his
claim
for
severance
pay,
then
he
has
completely
severe
it.
and
i'm
not
using
--
i'm
not
trying
to
play
all
the
words,
i'm
not
trying
to
use
the
word
severance
as
relating
to
severance
pay
but
i
mean
he
has
broken
off.
he
has
discontinued
by
his
option
all
employment-employee
relationships.
that
was
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
but
not
for
severance
pay
purposes.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
as
i
read
it.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
in
other
words,
he
had
no
employment
rights
upon
exercising
his
options
to
take
this
severance
pay.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
alright
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
well,
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
well,
the
very
letter
which
they
got
made
that
clear,
that
if
you
take
--
in
those
cases
where
they
say
that
we
have
closed
and
they
agreed
its
close,
they
get
a
letter,
they
sign
and
send
back.
it
says
upon
the
acceptance
of
it,
its
severance.
now
we've
just
interpreted
that
way
in
light
of
the
company's
policy
of
paying
severance
pay
which
not
very
often
but
once
in
a
while.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
i
don't
know
sir.
all
i
know
is
that
this
case
is
important
to
our
client
because
it
involves
$694.
now,
i'm
not
trying
to
be
precious
with
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
not
in
this
case,
not
in
this
case.
but
now
it's
been
over
10
years
and
that's
getting
pretty
permanent.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
i
mean
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
no
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
they
stipulated
too.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
no
sir,
no
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
did
try
one
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
four
or
five.
how
many
--
eight
in
all,
he
says.
i
think
there's
one
up
a
little
bit
that
--
here's
what
we're
involved
with
and
let's
take
the
issue
this
way
because
i
think
until
we
see
it
in
this
light,
we
--
it's
easy
to
miss
what
we're
dealing
with.
i
want
to
put
it
this
way
so
as
to
not
appear
on
the
negative
on
the
defensive
in
this
case.
i
--
we
do
not
come
here
in
any
defensive
situation.
we
feel
that
we
don't.
here's
what
we're
talking
about.
all
claims
was
the
word
on
that,
does
all
claims
based
on
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
come
within
that
orbit
to
be
governed
by
federal
substantive
law,
all
of
them.
or
to
put
another
way
this
federal
substantive
law
govern
all
claims
arising
out
of
the
labor
management
contract.
i
think
that's
a
blunt
--
simple
way
to
put
the
question.
now
if
they
do
not,
then
this
one
surely
must
follow
without
that
orbit.
and
let's
take
a
look
at
what
we
mean
by
orbit
and
perhaps
to
illustrate
some
other
fact
situation
might
help.
a
question
was
asked
a
moment
ago
by
justice
white
with
respect
to
personal
injuries
or
negligence.
now,
you
may
remember
that
in
some
states
even
where
workers'
compensation
covers
accidental
injury,
if
you've
got
an
injury
without
an
accident,
long
exposure
situations
that
you
can't
have
an
action
either
negligence
or
for
breach
of
contract.
suppose
for
a
moment
that
an
employee
sued
on
a
health
and
safety
provisions
of
a
union
contract
for
personal
injury.
is
that
the
type
that
would
be
arbitrable
on
the
301?
or
--
i'll
point
it
out
this
way,
take
a
note
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
alright
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
no
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
i'm
glad
you
asked
that.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
no
sir.
what
we're
saying
is
this,
this
is
merely
illustrative
of
why
this
suit
does
not
come
within
301.
there
may
be
many
other
reasons,
not
that
we're
trying
to
go
about
this
particular
one,
there
are
a
number
of
them.
why
the
policy
of
arbitration
in
the
first
place?
mr.
richard
l.
jones
oh,
no
sir.
we
did
--
we'd
come
here
in
a
terribly
defensive
situation
it
seemed
to
me.
we
do
not.
here's
what
we
say
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
well,
let
me
(voice
overlap)
--
those
are
not
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
--
not
to
bring
ourselves
outside
at
all.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
it
is
the
exception
of
the
general
rule
that
applies
federal
substantive
law
in
the
first
place.
that
is
the
exemption,
not
the
general
rule.
you
see,
go
back
to
erie
railroad
and
pick
up
and
come
(inaudible).
how
do
we
get
federal
substantive
law
in
the
first
place?
by
a
public
policy
that
cry
out
in
this
whole
labor
management
relationship.
these
disruptive
factors
in
labor
management
that
brought
about
taft-hartley
or
where
in
you
say
--
or
taft-hartley
was
just
brought
about
but
in
that
atmosphere
it
was
--
it
--
that
it
was
which
pronounced
an
arbitration
policy.
a
section
says
there
that
it
--
were
effectively
given
to
that
agreement
to
arbitrate.
now,
this
is
--
it
is
from
this
that
the
court
has
said
it
is
from
the
implication
of
this
federal
act
that
we're
going
to
create
this
body
of
federal
substantive
law
to
apply
to
those
situations
dealt
with
specifically
by
taft-hartley.
smith
versus
evening
news,
we
do
not
consider
that
all
claims
by
individuals
are
outside
the
orbit
of
301.
but
it
also
didn't
say
that
we
do
consider
that
they
all
are
within
the
orbit
of
301.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
yes
sir,
on
our
theory
i
think
they
could.
i
thought
about
that.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
i
thought
about
then,
i
think
to
be
consistent
we've
got
to
say
that
if
it
fall
--
so
we're
saying
that
here
we're
dealing
with
a
situation
not
within
the
purview.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
because
it
--
i
think
was
good
for
(inaudible)
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
because
the
(inaudible)
--
the
vulnerable
nature
of
the
arbitration
provision
under
state
law.
in
other
words,
if
there
is
provision
that
speaks
out
against
public
policy
in
a
contract
and
is
void
then
i
think
either
side
would
have
to
have
the
same
right
to
void
it.
i
think
they
say
it
void
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
--
but
i
think
in
the
--
in
the
technical
(inaudible)
mr.
richard
l.
jones
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
richard
l.
jones
well,
here's
what
we're
saying.
that
that's
what
has
happened
in
the
railroad
cases
and
you
have
allowed
state
law
to
govern.
the
second
circuit
said
that
just
not
long
ago
that
he
mentioned
not
because
of
any
federal
substantive
law,
because
they
said
new
york
state
would
require
and
arbitrate
it.
that's
what
the
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
well,
it
can
take
from
a
state
law
those
things
that
are
consistent
with
the
federal
policy
and
merge
it
into
federal
substantive
law,
yes.
now
that's
my
second
point
and
i
should
get
to
it
because
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
well
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
suppose
somebody
came
to
this
court
by
some
procedure,
i
haven't
thought
this
through,
know
how
to
get
here
but
so
supposing
was
here,
saying
that
we
made
contracts
up
in
chicago
and
deal
with
the
various
states.
i
guess
you
have
to
have
a
congressional
act
involved
first
that
unified
the
law.
well,
a
good
one
interstate
commerce
and
a
truck,
trucks
going
into
various
states.
this
court
had
just
said
we
will
not
create
a
body
of
federal
substantive
law
that
says
the
rules
to
the
road
in
mississippi
and
alabama
are
going
to
be
the
same
because
interstate
commerce
is
involved,
just
having
said
that.
and
you
--
and
when
you
started
off
at
the
westinghouse
case,
keep
this
in
mind
now.
when
you
started
off
the
westinghouse
case
there
were
some
serious
question
upon
--
about
the
presently
constituted
courts
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
this
thing
about
arbitration.
but
you
resolved
it
in
favor
of
the
constitutionality.
but
you
watched
it,
you
looked
at
it
and
workout
and
said,
"we've
got
watch
it
this
close".
and
because
if
we
get
beyond
what
congress
was
intending
to
do
in
taft-hartley
we're
going
beyond
the
constitutionality,
in
other
words
interpreted
to
favor
the
constitutionality
as
opposed
to
the
unconstitutionality
of
that.
then
you
came
along
later
and
said
that
--
and
overruled
westinghouse
in
the
smith
versus
evening
news.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
where
there
is
no
disruptive
element
involved
in
labor
management,
where
there
could
not
possibly
be
any
question.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
well,
because
he's
no
longer
employed.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
he's
not
dealing
--
he's
not
even
--
he's
not
even
bound
up
in
the
relationship
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
see,
once
a
man
takes
severance
pay,
what
could
be
more
complete
with
his
severance
of
employment
than
the
very
act
of
taking
it?
and
it
cannot
affect
any
other
employee
at
all,
couldn't
possibly
do
it,
even
more
so
than
a
wrongful
discharge.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
that's
right.
that's
what
the
--
that's
what's
the
railroad
cases
has
gone
of
or
completed.
now
the
railroad
case
as
they
say
sets
up
some
different
policy
about
this.
i
mean
you
permit
from
the
suing
state
court
and
that
state
court
governing
the
railroad
cases,
but
we
don't
want
to
do
it
here
because
there
are
some
different
congressional
policy.
well
how
can
that
possibly
be?
the
labor
--
the
railroad
labor
act
even
established
the
very
board
for
the
arbitration.
what
could
be
more
in
keeping
with
the
federal
and
--
federally
announced
public
policy
to
arbitrate
than
to
establish
the
board
from
the
arbitrated
being?
mr.
richard
l.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
that's
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
no
sir.
i
say
that
that
is
a
part
of
his
situation
and
this
--
and
those
are
the
peculiar
facts
of
the
case
before
you.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
no
sir.
i
say
that
the
federal
act
was
not
intent
and
could
not
i
believe
the
constitutionally
be
construed
to
have
been
intended,
to
have
included
every
possible
claim
that
a
person
would
have
under
this
union
contract.
now
the
union
brief
here
which
is
very
expertly
done
incidentally
takes
a
little
bit
different
position
in
the
company.
they
have
showed
the
evolutionary
process
of
this
and
say
you
hadn't
cross
the
river
yet,
but
you're
right
there
ready
to
ford
it.
you
--
you're
there
so
now
take
the
one
most
broad
leap
in
going
across.
that's
the
position
of
the
union.
the
(inaudible)
you've
already
done
this
and
already
said
--
the
authority
said,
you've
already
said
--
don't
need
to
be
said
--
cite
our
case
against
us.
but
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
yes,
they
miscalculated
by
the
full
amount.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
sir?
mr.
richard
l.
jones
yes
sir,
we
did,
i
mean
--
or
perhaps
you
post
the
exact
criteria,
i
might
have
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
oh,
excuse
me.
excuse
me.
i
missed
that.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
oh
no,
oh
no.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
no
sir,
no
sir.
that
their
case
probably
answers
that,
although
i
think
that
the
dissent
was
very
brilliantly
done
in
that
case.
but
the
day
case
does
--
that
does
not
stand
in
the
way
of
my
proposition.
but
it
does
say
that
if
it
would
have
that
disruptive
effect
on
presently
employed
employees,
then
we
will
also
say
that
comes
within
the
orbit
of
the
arbitrable
claims
as
opposed
to
lawsuits.
now,
here's
the
final
point
i
want
to
make,
both
sides
here
that
is
the
company
and
the
afl-cio
in
the
amicus
brief.
they
are
--
they
--
i
could
say
they
contend,
that
would
be
a
bad
choice
of
words.
they
assume
that
the
federal
law
if
applied
in
this
case
is
already
established
and
has
already
been
announced
and
therefore
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
decision
will
be
overruled.
now,
i'll
take
this
strong
issue
with
that.
i
think
that's
not
so
at
all
because
to
say
that
that's
true
is
to
say
this,
that
you're
going
to
create
and
have
--
already
began
that
process
of
creating
two
completely
line
of
cases
they
will
reach
completely
different
results,
one
in
the
railroad
cases
on
the
one
hand
and
the
other,
the
301
of
the
lmra
on
the
other.
i
don't
think
you've
done
that
at
all.
in
fact,
the
more
recent
cases
have
drawn
in
parallel
and
taken
language
from
one
and
applied
in
the
other.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
i
think
it
does.
i
think
there
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
well,
i
think
it's
talking
about
the
same
public
policy
about
--
i
think
he's
talking
about
the
public
policy
of
arbitration.
but
in
that
case
whether
that
had
arisen
under
railroad
labor
or
lmra,
i
think
your
results
would
have
been
the
same.
that's
what
i
think
it
has
to
do
with.
i
don't
see
two
distinct
lines
of
cases
grow
or
growing
out
of
this.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
because
i
don't
think
there's
going
to
be
any
difference.
i
think
your
decision
is
going
to
be
the
same
because
i
think
the
public
policy
announced
in
the
railroad
labor
act
is
the
same
policy
announced
under
lmra.
i
don't
see
any
difference.
so
that
i
think
that
the
line
of
cases
which
you've
already
established
the
right
of
an
employee
who
has
gotten
completely
away
from,
and
not
part
of
the
machinery
of
management
labor
relationship.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
and
i
don't
think
there
are.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
that's
right.
yes
sir.
you
would
create
a
completely
new
one,
not
have
--
not
already
created
and
not
bear
within
these
other
case.
where
you
have
enforced
arbitration
is
where
you
would
have
been
dealing
specifically
and
directly
with
that
disruptive
element
in
management
labor,
that's
where
you
said
you
got
to
arbitrate
because
of
--
taft-hartley
says
so,
if
the
parties
agreed
to.
only
one
confusing
case
in
this
whole
line
that
i
see,
this
has
been
very
intriguing
but
interesting
to
take
these
cases,
we're
not
dealing
with
them
as
i
don't
and
follow
the
consistency
and
the
line
of
reasoning
that
has
brought
us
up
to
this
point,
most
intriguing.
only
one
case
bothered
me
some,
and
i
think
perhaps
just
because
i
don't
understand
something
in
the
record.
justice
black
dissents
in
lucas
flour
and
says
if
there
was
no
agreement
to
arbitrate
and
yet
the
majority
goes
off
on
the
assumption
that
there
was.
that
one
is
–
that
throws
me
a
little
bit
on
that
one
feature.
outside
of
that,
it
is
the
--
their
thinking
has
been
clear,
it
has
responded
to
this
public
outcry
of
a
public
policy
to
keep
down
confusion
and
conflict
to
this
disruptive
effect
and
management
labor.
and
you've
done
that
under
the
policy
announced
by
lmra.
by
the
same
token
you
said
if
that's
not
involved
and
it
doesn't
come
within
the
scope
and
the
orbit
and
field
of
operation
of
taft-hartley,
just
like
it
didn't
come
within
the
wrongful
discharge,
didn't
come
within
railroad
labor.
then
we
leave
him
either
one
or
two
ways.
and
here,
remember
that
--
i
don't
mean
that
i'm
disinterested
or
made
in
that
sense,
but
i
don't
stand
in
the
position
of
the
company
who
has
to
deal
with
this
tomorrow
and
the
next
day
and
so
forth
or
the
position
of
the
union
who
must
do
it,
i
stand
here
with
this
one
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
--
one
thought.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
only
if
he
accepts
--
only
if
he
accepts
and
that's
the
distinction
on
one
of
the
cases
that
he
mentions.
only
if
he
accepts
his
discharge
as
filed,
so
as
he
is
not
suing
for
reemployment
rights.
so,
you
said
that
--
that's
the
difference
in
moore
and
slocum.
slocum
wanted
his
job
back
and
his
backpay.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
he
can
go
to
court.
and
can
do
so
under
two
theory
--
one
of
two
theories,
either
ones
are
(inaudible).
that
taft-hartley
just
doesn't
reach
this
and
there
is
no
federal
body
of
substantive
law
which
applies.
or
yes
taft-hartkey
does
but
just
as
we've
done
in
the
railroad
cases,
we
state
what
that
public
policy
is
and
it's
the
same
as
alabama
state.
in
other
words,
to
say
that
federal
substantive
law
applies,
it's
not
to
say
that
charlie
maddox
loses
his
lawsuit
because
in
the
railroad
case,
as
you've
already
said,
that
we'll
announce
a
public
policy.
and
that
part
of
the
policy
is
that
if
--
that
the
doors
of
the
courthouse
are
open
and
he
don't
have
the
right
to
sue
and
go
into
court
and
make
use
of
that
guarantee
of
the
constitution
to
be
useful.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
well,
i
think
the
court
certainly
had
that
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
i
think
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
i
think
the
court
had
to
deal
with
that
in
another
set
of
facts
but
the
same
basic
question
in
erie
railraod
where
the
old
case
that
justice
holmes
had
dissented
in
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
that
is
true.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
richard
l.
jones
but
--
mr.
richard
l.
jones
but
we
would
look
back
and
say
what
within
the
labor
contract
was
taft-hartley
dealing
with?
what
were
they
talking
about?
what
was
the
concern
of
congress
over
those
matters
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
disruptive
effect
and
the
peace
within
the
industry?
mr.
richard
l.
jones
if
he
wants
it
that
way,
and
i've
got
a
selfish
interest
involved
in
that
because
i
won't
--
my
right
to
sit
and
(inaudible)
walk
in
my
door
for
me
to
represent
him
if
he
so
chooses
to
do
so.
thank
you.
