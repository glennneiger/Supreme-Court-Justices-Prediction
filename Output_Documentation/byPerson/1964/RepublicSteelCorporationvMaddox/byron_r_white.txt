justice
byron
r.
white
what
this
means
then
is
that
if
a
--
if
the
union
sues
and
hasn't
exhausted
the
administrative
remedies
under
the
contract,
there's
no
suit
at
all?
there's
no
remedy
at
all?
i
mean,
that's
the
one
and
only.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
if
it's
gone
through
the
procedure
and
has
been
decided
in
the
procedure
against
it,
it
also
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
burr,
the
suggestion
really
isn't
that
this
is
an
exhaustion
of
remedies
although
this
--
i
mean,
this
is
really
--
what
you're
really
saying
this
is
an
exclusive
remedy.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
exclusive
remedy.
alright,
there's
some
allegations
that
an
individual
employee
could
make
in
a
situation
like
this
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
just
mere
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
union?
they
just
let
the
time
go
by.
the
grievance
procedure
isn't
available
for
--
except
within
a
certain
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
the
other
hand,
the
employers
who
signed
the
contract
and
deliberately
decided
that
this
fellow
had
no
rights
under
the
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
didn't
give
him
severance
pay.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right,
i
mean
you
can't
suggest
the
employer
didn't
--
wasn't
aware
of
the
fellow
--
the
facts
that
the
fellow
had
been
discharged
or
that
there
might
be
a
claim
under
the
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
say
that
this
issue,
this
--
it's
the
same
kind
of
issue
had
been
determined
in
connection
with
other
employees
at
the
same
mine
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
by
the
arbitrators,
is
that
a
public
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
decision
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
were
the
employees
of
the
same
bargaining
unit
with
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
the
union
here
had
asked
the
employer
to
arbitrate
this
claim
of
your
client
and
the
company
said
this
isn't
an
argument
for
the
reasons
at
all.
do
you
think
the
company
could
have
gotten
away
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
--
the
company
couldn't
get
away
with
that,
neither
can
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
how
would
you
define
those,
that
class
or
category
of
cases
which
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
you're
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
a
--
if
the
employer
just
came
around
because
i'm
terminating
you
and
he
says,
â€œwell,
you
don't
have
any
right
to
terminate
me
but
i'll
be
terminated"
--
i
mean,
if
he
takes
severance
pay
then
--
anytime
that
determination
is
what
you're
saying.
justice
byron
r.
white
anytime
they
could
terminate
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
not
--
you
don't
rely
at
all
on
any
intermediate
position
that
the
bargaining
unit
was
here
dissolved
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
consequently
the
--
that
the
arbitration
procedure,
the
administrative
--
so-called
administrative
remedy
is
nonexistent,
it
just
isn't
available.
there's
no
foreman,
no
employees,
the
grievance
procedure
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can't
expect
the
union
to
watch
out
for
me
now,
the
union
has
gone
to
at
this
particular
place.
you're
not
picking
that
position,
that
isn't
what
you
rely
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
isn't
the
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
central
airlines
have
anything
to
do
with
that
question
or
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
it
have
to
do
with
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
on
the
--
you
mean
not
on
the
applicability
of
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that's
what
you
said
in
the
--
with
the
--
was
different
between
the
two
lines
of
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
two
cases
could
be
--
two
lines
of
cases
--
there
shouldn't
be
two
lines
of
cases
--
justice
byron
r.
white
we
would
create
one
if
we
decided
to
get
through
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
wrongful
discharge
case,
i
supposed
you
would
say
that
is
an
arbritable
matter.
the
union
says
this
fellow
shouldn't
been
discharged
and
--
that
reasons
for
it.
the
fellow
has
been
discharged
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
wants
severance
pay
and
the
company
says
he
isn't
entitled
to
it,
he
can
go
to
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
correlative
policies
not
only
of
a
case
but
of
uniformity?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
get
payment
at
the
same
time
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
--
adjudicated
under
state
law
and
the
federal
law
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
possibly
different
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
happens
to
deal
with
a
--
this
happens
to
deal
with
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
have
to
rely
on
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
(inaudible)
your
right
to
severance
pay.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
source
is
in
that
collective
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
part
of
that
issue
here
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
even
in
one
collective
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
several
courts,
the
--
they
adjudicate
it
as
i
--
on
the
different
standards
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
and
if
it
does,
if
it
does,
it
would
still
be
a
policy
consistent
without
announcing
the
railroad
cases
which
would
permit
him
to
sue.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
therefore,
you
have
to
say
that
this
is
not
an
arbitrable
matter,
the
union
has
got
no
business
in
it
at
all.
