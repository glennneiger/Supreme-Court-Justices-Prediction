justice
potter
stewart
these
were
westbound
only?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
in
addition
to
those
specific
exceptions,
there
are
good
many
commodities
that
simply
can't
travel
in
boxcars,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
in
practical
matter,
those
were
also
--
justice
potter
stewart
so,
do
you
understand
the
holding
that
--
that's
violated
the
national
transportation
policy
insofar
as
it
amounted
to
a
destructive,
competitive
practice
to
be
that
the
--
that
it
was
self-destructive.
it
was
a
self-destructive,
competitive
practice
with
a
harm
done
was
to
the
--
to
the
new
haven
railroad?
justice
potter
stewart
the
destruction
done?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
does
it
need
to
be
both?
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
there's
a
holding
here
that
it
was
both?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
--
that's
not
a
holding
that
they
lost
money
necessarily
and
depending
on
justice
white's
question
but
merely
a
suggestion
that
maybe
they
didn't
make
as
much
money.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
very
little
addition
revenue
which
indicated
at
least
they
made
less
money,
made
less
profit.
justice
potter
stewart
put
in
these
rates.
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
whole
assumption
is
that
they
wouldn't
have
had
this
four
million
additional
pound
had
they
not
put
in
the
new
rates?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
they
carried
four
million
pounds
less
freight.
justice
potter
stewart
the
eastern
district
goes
to
the
mississippi
then
down
south
to
as
far
as
the
ohio,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
no
finding
at
all
and
by
the
commission.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
understand
that,
no
holding
by
the
commission,
no
decision
that
--
that
the
inherent
advantage
of
truck
transportation
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
impaired.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
was
an
explicit
--
explicit
finding
to
the
contrary
by
the
court.
that
is
an
affirmative
finding
that
it
was
not
impaired,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
towards
the
close
of
the
court's
opinion,
i
haven't
got
it
right
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
implicit,
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
and
now
so
you're
here
not
quarrelling
with
that,
not
saying
that
you
have
been
directly
damaged
by
these
rates,
directly
damage
--
your
competitive
position
directly
damage
by
these
rates,
are
you?
you're
trying
to
say
the
railroad
from
itself
as
i
get
it.
justice
potter
stewart
there
only
be
--
can
there
be
a
maximum
of
only
two
commodities
on
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
was
--
well
then
i've
misunderstood
you
and
i
thought
i'd
ask,
can
there
be
no
more
than
two
and
that
you
said
yes,
there
can
be
no
more
than
two.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know.
it's
a
different
question.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
saying
two
is
quite
opposite
thing,
unless
my
ears
are
deceiving.
how
many
commodities
are
you
allowed
to
ship
on
the
piggyback?
justice
potter
stewart
any
number.
justice
potter
stewart
but
at
least
two.
justice
potter
stewart
okay.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
so.
justice
potter
stewart
doesn't
section
1(6)
reflect
that
concept
of
great
regulation
and
insofar
as
the
commission
found
that
this
violated
1(6)
that
it
violated
the
value
of
service
concept.
would
that
be
fair
to
say?
justice
potter
stewart
which
has
the
expense
of
loading
and
unloading
various
commodities?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
among
other
things
it
does
that
1(6)
does
reflects
the
--
as
in
the
matter
of
railroad
economics
of
the
value
of
service
concept
which
the
district
court
said
was
now
an
obsolete
concept
in
view
the
facts
of
railroads
are
no
longer
monopolies.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
to
destroy
the
concept
of
section
1(6).
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
basis
for
the
commission
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
1(6)
--
section
1(6)
is
“we
pledge
at
least
in
part
economic
concept
of
value
of
service
to
the
amount”.
justice
potter
stewart
reflected
in
one.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
and
the
--
and
the
--
at
least
it
is
said
that
the
underlying
basic
important
question
in
this
case
is
the
issue
of
the
continuing
validity
or
not
of
the
value
of
service
doctrine
today,
and
if
so,
to
what
extent
it
continues
to
be
valid,
am
i
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
government's
brief
as
well?
justice
potter
stewart
you
tell
--
justice
potter
stewart
they
both
stand
vacated.
that's
the
judgment
and
there's
nothing
we
can
do
--
the
opinion
or
we're
still
be
putting
around
and
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
any
suggestion
on
specifically
of
the
question
of
the
continuing
validity
of
the
value
of
service
concept?
justice
potter
stewart
so
they're
thought.
and
that's
the
--
that's
the
underlying
important
issue
here,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
the
thing
that
is
suggested
to
me
at
least
my
brother's
questions,
whether
or
not
all
of
these
shouldn't
be
developed
on
a
further
hearing
in
this
case
before
the
commission,
because
none
of
that
has
developed
by
the
commission,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
people
whose
located
in
parts
of
markets
based
on
--
based
on
having
a
great,
great
subsidized
by
high-value
commodities.
justice
potter
stewart
that
your
contention
which
i
think
i
fully
understand
that
regardless
of
any
further
findings
or
development
in
further
hearings
that
you
are
basically
at
issue
here,
now
in
this
case
which
is
properly
here
and
which
necessarily
involves
this
issue.
you
are
basically
at
issue
as
to
the
applicability
of
1(6)
to
commodity
rates.
justice
potter
stewart
this
sends
both
trailers
on
one
flatcar?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
important
i
just
think
to
remember
that
these
rights
in
your
issues
just
applicable
to
chicago
and
st.
louis
less
found.
justice
potter
stewart
from
the
way
of
--
how
new
a
development
is
a
commodity
rates,
are
they
fairly
new?
justice
potter
stewart
more
sparingly.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
it's
what
99%
of
the
freight.
justice
potter
stewart
what
brought
them
in
on
the
freights,
did
they
come
in
the
days
when
railroads
were
still
a
monopoly?
justice
potter
stewart
what
brought
them
in?
justice
potter
stewart
although
that
new
haven
now
itself
does
have
piggyback.
justice
potter
stewart
physical
and
(voice
overlap)
but
i
understood
those
were
correct
and
perhaps
that's
outside
the
record.
