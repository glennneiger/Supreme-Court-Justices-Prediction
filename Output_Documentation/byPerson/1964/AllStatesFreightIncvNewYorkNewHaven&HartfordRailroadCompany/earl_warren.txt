chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
a
holding
that
it
needs
to
be
harmful
to
both?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
carpenter,
may
i,
just
for
the
purpose
of
orienting
myself
better,
ask
this
question.
as
i
understand
it
was
held
below
that
this
did
not
injure
the
truckers
and
that
you
do
not
raise
that
issue
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
vital
interest
of
the
truckers
that
you're
trying
to
protect
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
not
to
point
against
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
court
held
that
you
were
not
injured
and
that
you
do
not
raise
that
issue
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
does
seem
to
me
that
you
--
you're
arguing
more
for
the
new
york,
new
haven
and
hartford
than
you
are
for
your
own
client.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
prompted
my
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
did
too.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
carpenter
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
carpenter,
i
just
--
just
like
to
ask
you
one
more
question
then
i
won't
take
any
more
of
your
time.
but
if
the
commission
made
no
finding
as
to
whether
you
are
injured
or
not,
the
record
wouldn't
support
any
finding
that
you
were
not.
why
do
--
why
is
it
that
you
don't
bring
that
issue
to
us
when
the
court
below
found
that
you
were
not
injured?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
the
--
didn't
the
commission
itself
recognized
the
inadequacy
of
these
findings?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ginnane.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kaier.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
could.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hunt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
carpenter.
