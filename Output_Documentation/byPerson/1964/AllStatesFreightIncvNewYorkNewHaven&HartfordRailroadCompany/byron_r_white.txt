(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
well
that
does
include
when
they
ship
at
low
cost,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that's
to
the
contrary.
justice
byron
r.
white
fully
distributed.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
the
commission
didn't
find
your
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
what
you
said
earlier
that
the
finding
of
the
destructive
competitive
practice
necessarily
--
necessarily
involves
injury
to
some
competitor
and
to
the
actor
himself
and
that
therefore,
i
gather
from
what
you've
earlier
said
that
that
it
is
essential
finding
destructive
competitor
of
competitive
practice,
a
few
people
were
hurt,
i
mean
directly.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
the
answer,
aren't
you
contending
that
you
are
hurt
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
directly
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
could
you
avoid
it
if
one
of
the
issues
is
whether
there's
a
destructive
competitive
practice
and
harm
to
you
is
an
essential
of
the
destructive
competitive
practice
as
you
put
it,
i'm
not
saying
i
agree
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
somebody
--
if
somebody
you're
on
(inaudible)
injury
to
you
were
essential
have
misguided
you
that
conclusion
might
be
that
you
wouldn't
be
hurt.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
long
as
you
send
under
the
particular
destination.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
according
to
your
view,
completing
its
suicide.
is
that
--
why
would
the
railroad
really
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
why
you
got
corporate
management
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
about
the
--
and
what
about
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
still
that
management
supposedly.
you
got
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
it
commit
a
suicide
like
this
in
the
course
of
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
opinion
that
you
would
have
--
that
you
have
motor
carrier
held
--
hold
an
appeal
you
would
have
standing
in
its
entirety,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
yes,
but
on
the
new
--
but
maybe
on
a
new
case
on
the
different
theory
that
you
would
have
had
these
two
points.
you
would
have
left
the
district
court's
judgment
just
standing.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
about
the
low
rates.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
the
low-value
commodities,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
issues
--
the
way
you
approach
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
validity
or
not
of
that
rate
service.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
affect
of
rules
applies
to
flatcars
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
at
this
point
then
the
(inaudible).
was
there
finding
to
that
matter
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
issues?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
your
(inaudible)
consider
up
to
this
kind
of
this
--
the
government
does
it
for
free
that
on
page
29
when
they're
talking
about
this
mixing
rules,
this
question
is
not
the
one
that
the
court
could
be
called
upon
to
consider
the
evidence
and
findings
by
the
commission
which
it
did
not
address
itself
to
these
considerations.
they
should
be
given
after
they
do
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
the
government
is
suggesting
that
we
shouldn't
assume
that
at
this
juncture
that
here
that
new
haven
could
compete
if
it
had
a
mixing
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
really
aren't
all
agreed
on
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
really
aren't
all
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
the
--
and
i
suppose
that
it
does
show
that
the
erosion
of
your
traffic
was
a
rest
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
this
is
the
real
point,
isn't
it
that
--
and
this
is
one
of
the
real
point,
the
comparison
of
the
--
the
comparison
between
what
the
new
rates
produce
and
what
would
have
been
produced
with
just
the
old
rates,
had
you
carried
the
same
amount
of
traffic
is
meaningless
unless
--
unless
you
can
show
--
unless
you
can
show
that
you
would
have
carried
the
same
amount
of
traffic
--
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
you
have
to
do
rates,
you
might
have
only
carried
half
as
much.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
--
justice
byron
r.
white
which
means
that
even
--
which
means
that
if
you
work
making
a
million
dollars
off
this
new
traffic,
you
weren't
losing
as
much
as
you
would
have
without
the
rate.
i
mean
at
least
if
you
would
--
the
argument
is
--
the
argument
is
that
these
are
very
least
that
this
had
to
do
with
to
--
is
to
arrest
your
laws
of
traffic,
and
the
erosion
of
your
business,
that's
the
very
least
that
you
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they're
still
continuing
these
rates
after
five
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
got
the
big
flatcar?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
got
the
large
flatcar
that
can
carry
trailers.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
conclude
the
argument
on
your
side?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
question
through
mr.
hunt.
why
isn't
--
why
isn't
literally
speaking
this
rate
that
you
published
a
class
rate,
and
then
applies
to
a
lot
of
commodities
but
you
know
a
lot
of
commodities
with
enterprises?
there
are
some
exclusions.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
so
--
is
that
--
that's
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
a
prescribe
--
this
is
a
prescribed
uniform
classification
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
which
the
railroads
must
conform
if
you're
going
to
have
a
class
rate?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
a
classification
that
the
railroads
must
comply
with
if
they're
going
to
publish
a
class
rate,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
that
--
it
must
prescribe
with
this
--
comply
with
this
classification
and
it's
going
to
publish
a
class
rate.how
do
you
know
when
you
published
a
class
rate?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
isn't
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
gather
that
under
the
commission's
approach
that
within
one
area
--
within
one
area
there
couldn't
be
both
a
class
rate
and
an
all
commodity
rate
which
the
commission
would
approve.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
in
all
--
in
all
commodity
rate
--
rates
just
couldn't
ever
exist
within
the
same
territory
with
a
--
with
a
class
rate.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
didn't
it
want
to
go
through
the
jobs
of
--
of
publishing
some
new
class
rates?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
i
suppose
also
those
rates
wouldn't
have
done
the
job
you
wanted
them
to
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
have
the
other
railroads
involved
here
maintained
their
all
commodity
rates
also?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
all
of
them
now
have
piggyback,
including
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
would
the
experience
of
the
new
haven
assume
that
this
case
were
remanded
to
the
commission
a
new
findings?
would
the
experience
of
the
new
haven
in
the
last
three
years
on
these
rates
be
meaningful
to
the
--
in
terms
of
the
points
about
which
you've
been
talking?
i
mean
that
you've
been
talking
about
this
comparison
that
was
made.
justice
byron
r.
white
you'd
have
to
go
to
a
certain
period
of
time
on
certain
shipments
and
it
was
the
study
that
was
made
with
the
railroad,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
i
suppose
that
--
you
would
have
a
continued
experience
with
the
rates
that
might
be
examined.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
you're
--
you're
having
piggyback
and
other
factors
that
just
dried
up
to
traffic
that
are
moving
on
these
--
on
these
rates.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
the
extent
that
the
piggyback
is
taking
the
traffic
and
to
that
extent
as
this
whole
issue
less
important.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
issue
you're
arguing
about
here
then
becomes
progressively
less
important.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
was
in
the
--
which
case
was
that
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
on
the
plan
iii
of
piggyback?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
not
the
mixture.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
now
can
--
the
new
--
the
new
haven's
piggyback
is
moving
under
that
class
three.
justice
byron
r.
