mr.
edward
a.
kaier
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
i
should
first
address
myself
to
the
question
which
has
--
have
been
discussed
in
the
last
five
minutes.
i
think,
your
honors,
that
the
district
court
did
decide
a
matter
essential
to
its
decision
and
a
matter
which
was
put
up
to
it
by
the
parties
for
decision
namely,
the
applicability
of
section
1(6)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
these
rates.
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honors,
it
was
the
commission's
decision
on
that
issue
which
caused
us
to
take
the
case
to
court.
we
feel
so
strongly
that
section
1(6)
was
meant
to
apply
only
to
class
rates
and
that
it
was
here
distorted
to
apply
to
commodity
rates
and
to
reach
a
result
not
permitted
by
section
15a(3)
that
we
went
to
court.
so
we
submit
that
on
that
issue,
there
is
a
solid
basis
for
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
by
this
court
and
that
it
will
not
simply
be
declaring
principles
for
rendering
an
advisory
opinion
on
that.
now,
as
far
as
the
value
of
service
matter
is
concerned,
i
think
there
is
much
to
what
mr.
ginnane
said.
i
believe
that
the
lower
court
did
use
language
that
was
too
broad
with
reference
to
that.
certainly,
it
is
true
that
some
railroad
rates
have
to
be
made
as
high
as
reasonably
the
traffic
can
be
made
to
bear,
and
that's
what
value
of
service
of
course
means.
and
that
must
be
done.
and
i
don't
think
it's
been
outlawed.
but
i
do
not
think,
your
honors,
that
the
value
of
service
matter
was
at
all
necessary
to
the
lower
court's
opinion.
it
did
not
reach
its
opinion,
i
may
suggest,
on
the
basis
of
value
of
service.
this
is
what
it
said.
it
was
trying
to
get
at
the
commission's
motive
for
having
invoked
the
classification
requirement
of
section
1(6)
and
it's
simply
speculated
that
the
commission's
motive
was
to
hold
fast
to
the
value
of
service
principle.
it
said,
it
would
appear
that
the
commission
here
invokes
1(6)
as
a
means
of
preserving
a
basis
for
the
value
of
service
principle
and
then
it
went
on
and
gave
the
rather
broad
statements
to
the
effect
that
value
of
service
was
something
or
the
past
and
really
outlawed
by
the
transportation
policy.
now,
your
honors,
the
same
court
said
very
much
the
same
thing.
it
was
composed
of
different
judges
in
the
other
new
haven
case.
and
in
that
case,
this
is
the
way
your
court
disposed
of
the
matter.
you
said,
“the
court
below
set
out
at
some
length
its
understanding
of
the
commission's
method
of
arriving
at
carrier
cost
its
analysis
of
the
role
of
value
of
service
concepts
in
ratemaking
and
its
views
of
the
precise
circumstances
under
which
the
commission
could
lawfully
disallow
the
rates
at
issue.”
then
you
said,
“we
find
it
unnecessary
to
consider
that
discussion
in
this
instance
since
we
hold
only
that
on
the
present
record,
the
disallowance
of
the
rates
in
question
was
not
adequately
supported.”
now,
i
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
you
could
decide
the
section
1(6)
point
which
was
basic
to
the
lower
court's
decision
and
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
decision.
and
you
could
say
that
as
to
the
value
of
service
matter,
you
are
not
passing
on
that
and
it
need
not
be
passed
upon.
and
with
those
views,
i
should
think,
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
court
does
have
a
basis
for
jurisdiction
and
i
respectfully
suggest
could
and
should
hear
us
on
the
1(6)
point
--
section
1(6)
point.
and
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
the
rates
are
in
effect,
mr.
justice
black,
and
have
been
for
five
years.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
that
is
correct.
it
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
that
is
correct.
it
would
not
be.
but
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
there
is
nothing
undone
which
needs
to
be
done
for
your
honors
to
pass
on
the
1(6)
issue.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
the
way
we
approach
it
well
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
yes
sir,
yes.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
well
of
course,
the
important
thing,
if
your
honor
please,
is
that
we
are
here.
we
prepared
for
it.
the
briefs
have
been
written
and
i
don't
think
we
would
be
any
--
any
better
off.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
mr.
justice
black,
it
really
isn't
--
it
really
isn't
that.
i
mean
objectively,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
anything
lacking
for
the
court
to
pass
on
the
legal
questions
as
to
whether
section
1(6)
applies
to
non-class
rates.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
oh,
no.
if
you
decide
that
in
our
favor,
i
think
the
case
is
over.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
well,
i
suppose
they
like
to
win
eventually
but
i
don't
see
that
that's
a
reason,
sir,
for
not
deciding
the
legal
questions,
the
applicability
of
1(6).
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
i
think
that
if
you
decide
that
legal
question,
you
have
decided
the
merits
of
this
case
because
i
submit
there
is
no
other
basis
upon
which
the
commission's
order
could
be
sustained
if
you
decide
that
section
1(6)
did
not
apply.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
yes,
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
that
is
absolutely
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
and
in
the
court
below,
when
that
issue
was
raised,
no
one
suggested
neither
government
nor
trucking
associations
that
the
case
wasn't
right
for
decision
on
that
point.
and
the
court
didn't
decide
it.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
yes.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
that's
what
they
want
to
do,
mr.
justice,
yes.
shall
i
proceed
with
my
argument,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
well,
my
argument
of
course
is
on
the
applicability
of
section
1(6)
to
commodity
rates
or
i
might
say
to
non-class
rates
which
i
call
commodity
rates.
and
i
should
like
to
add
very
briefly
to
the
facts
which
have
been
stated
to
you
by
mr.
carpenter.
first,
the
new
haven
relies
very
heavily
upon
the
category
of
traffic
known
as
manufactured
and
miscellaneous
for
the
revenues
necessary
to
operate
its
line.
60%
and
more
of
its
freight
revenues
come
from
that
category
of
traffic.
by
reason
of
truck
competition,
both
private
and
for
hire,
the
long-haul
traffic
of
the
new
haven
then
is
that
originated
by
it
then
delivered
to
connections
in
this
category
of
manufacture
and
miscellaneous.
it
was
cut
in
half
between
1947
and
1958.
it
dropped
from
2,942,000
tons
in
1947
to
a
1,480,000
in
1958.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
it
went
down
--
it's
pretty
steadily
year
by
year
in
good
years
and
bad.
and
then
as
has
been
told
you,
the
new
haven
was
confronted
with
an
additional
competitive
force,
one
in
july
1958
competing
railroads
established
this
plan
iii,
trailer-on-flatcar
piggyback
service.
as
mr.
carpenter
said
during
the
first
two
months
that
that
service
was
in
effect,
the
new
haven
lost
to
the
new
york
central
an
addition
--
400
carloads
of
traffic
from
boston
to
st.
louis
alone
and
it
lost
additional
traffic
that
originated
at
connecticut
points,
was
trucked
to
new
york,
there
put
on
flatcars,
and
moved
out
by
other
railroads
from
that
point.
so
it
was
obvious,
your
honors,
that
the
new
haven
had
to
do
something
to
meet
these
committed
--
competitive
forces
that
were
taking
its
vital
traffic,
the
traffic
without
which
it
couldn't
render
service.
the
logical
thing
for
it
to
do,
it
concluded,
was
to
reduce
its
rates
for
boxcar
service.
and
this
was
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
new
haven
has
a
very
large
imbalance
of
movement
as
between
loaded
and
empty.
with
a
150
cars
a
day
moving
empty
from
points
on
its
line
to
st.
louis
and
chicago
where
they
are
given
over
to
western
connections.
we
said
150
cars
a
month
in
our
brief
which
i
regret
that
is
wrong,
it's
150
a
day.
and
this
amounts
to
an
unused
capacity
of
three
million
tons
a
year.
now,
the
second
factor
which
indicated
that
the
way
that
new
haven
should
proceed
was
to
reduce
its
boxcar
rates,
was
that
it
had
disabilities
with
respect
to
the
performance
of
trailer-on-flatcar
service.
equipment
disabilities,
clearance
disabilities,
some
but
not
all
were
cleared
up.
by
the
time
the
commission's
decision
was
rendered,
by
no
means
all
have
been
cleared
up.
they
still
have
equipment
difficulties
and
they're
upgrading
with
the
scope
of
being
unable
to
handle
40-foot
trailers
which
are
very
popular
on
40-foot
cars
which
is
the
kind
that
new
haven
has
most
of.
now,
since
these
empty
cars
were
moving,
anyway,
it
would
of
course
be
a
very
economial
thing
for
the
new
haven
to
transport
traffic
in
them.
so
it
filed
a
reduced
rates
applying
from
new
york,
from
new
england
points
to
the
plateau
places
that
it
was
delivering
these
empty
boxcars
to
st.
louis
and
chicago.
the
rates
were
made
substantially
on
the
same
level
as
the
piggyback
rates
of
the
competing
carriers
affect
which
mr.
hunt
will
discuss
when
he
discusses
as
he
will
the
destructive
competitive
practice
point.
now,
it
has
been
said,
your
honors,
that
the
--
a
mixture
rule
applies
in
connection
with
the
piggyback
rates
and
the
other
carriers
requiring
that
at
least
a
minimum
of
60%
of
the
commodities
be
other
than
one
commodity.
there
must
be
not
more
than
60%
of
one,
that's
it,
a
maximum,
not
more
than
60%
of
one
commodity.
however,
one
shipper
can
have
a
trailer
load
completely
of
chairs
or
anything
else.
another
shipper
can
have
a
trailer
load
of
completely
of
desks
or
anything
else.
and
then
they
get
together
through
a
shipper
association
and
tender
these
two
cars
as
one
shipment
and
it
moves.
so
the
mixing
rule
is
something
that
--
can
easily
be
complied
with
without
embarrassment
to
the
shipper
who
is
shipping
on
piggyback
rates.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
both
trailers
on
one
flatcar.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
precisely.
so
that
the
new
haven
in
connection
with
its
rates
could
not
have
a
mixing
rule
and
meet
that
competition.
now,
the
rates
are
called
all
commodity
rates
but
has
--
has
been
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
i
think
there
were,
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
recall
that
there
were
any
findings
about
that.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
no.
no
we
all
agreed
on
that.
we
all
agreed
on
that,
no
issue
about
it.
the
rates
are
called
all
commodity
rates
but
of
course
in
fact
they
are
not
all
commodity
rates
as
has
already
been
brought
out
to
exclude
a
good
many
things
damaged
--
easily
damaged
goods,
all
the
many
articles
of
commerce
that
move
in
flatcars,
in
tank
cars,
in
refrigerator
cars,
gondola
cars
and
so
forth
exclude
them
for
traffic
which
has
high
port
costs.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
yes.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
perhaps
the
government
is
contending
--
contending
that,
mr.
justice
white.
i
really
don't
think
that
it's
essential
to
--
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
pardon
me?
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
i
thought
we
were.
and
i
saw
mr.
carpenter,
i
thought
nodding
approval
and
i
had
recalled
that
the
matter
was
mentioned
in
the
commission's
brief
but
i
didn't
recall
that
they
indicated
additional
findings
where
it
needed.
no
shipper
or
receiver
of
freight
opposed
the
rates.
they
were
opposed
only
by
the
new
haven's
competitors.
they
were
found
to
cover
a
fully
distributed
cost
which
means
of
course
the
cost
of
hauling
the
traffic
involved
plus
the
contribution
to
overheads
plus
the
contribution
to
passenger
deficit
and
less
than
carload
deficit.
now,
with
those
remarks,
i
should
like
to
discuss
the
applicability
of
section
1(6)
to
these
rates.
class
rates
are
applied
to
traffic
by
means
of
two
separate
tariffs.
one
is
called
the
classification.
and
in
the
classification,
virtually
all
articles
of
commerce
are
assigned
to
one
or
another
of
the
classes
which
are
about
31
in
number.
no
rates
are
specified
in
that
tariff.
then
there's
another
tariff
called
the
class
rate
tariff
in
which
the
rates
in
cents
per
hundred
pounds
are
set
forth
between
all
points
roughly
east
to
the
rocky
mountains
and
they
show
the
rate
applicable
on
each
of
the
classes
made
in
the
classification
tariff.
the
class
rates
are
established
independent
of
the
articles
upon
which
they
will
apply
and
the
classification
is
established
independent
of
the
rates.
now,
commodity
rates
in
contrast
are
made
specifically
applicable
to
a
mean
commodity
or
group
of
commodities.
with
respect
to
these
commodity
rates,
therefore,
the
function
which
is
indispensable
in
applying
a
class
rate
to
a
given
shipment
that
of
assigning
the
article
to
a
given
classification
simply
does
not
take
place.
now,
it
is
obvious
that
even
though
a
class
rate
may
be
entirely
reasonable,
a
shipper
can
be
hurt,
can
be
charged
an
excessive
rate
or
a
rate
which
is
improperly
related
to
another
commodity
or
to
a
rate
on
another
commodity
by
the
classification
into
which
his
article
is
placed.
with
respect
to
things
which
move
under
class
rates,
therefore,
it
was
thought
necessay
that
there'd
be
legal
protection
of
the
act
of
classifying,
making
the
classification.
and
therefore,
section
1(6)
of
the
act
which
enjoins
upon
the
carriers
to
establish
just
and
reasonable
classification
with
reference
to
which
rates
are
or
maybe
made
shall
be
established
and
it
prohibited
every
unjust
and
unreasonable
classification.
in
the
case
of
commodity
rates,
however,
section
1(6)
would
serve
no
purpose,
not
served
by
other
sections
of
the
act.
if
a
rate
is
too
high,
it
is
unlawful
under
section
15(1)
which
prohibits
unreasonable
rates
and
the
commission
may
reduce
it
under
section
15(1).
if
it
is
improperly
related
to
another
rate,
it
is
unduly
prejudicial
under
section
3
and
the
commission
may
reduce
it
--
may
correct
the
relationship
under
section
15(1).
if
it
is
too
low,
the
commission
may
find
it
unreasonable
under
section
1
as
supplemented
by
the
national
transportation
policy
and
15a(2)
and
enter
a
minimum
rate
order
under
section
15(1),
so
that
every
situation,
with
respect
to
commodity
rates,
is
covered
by
these
other
sections
of
the
act.
now,
your
honors
at
the
time
the
interstate
commerce
act
was
passed
in
1887
most
traffic
moved
on
class
rates
and
there
was
complaint
to
the
committee
which
was
considering
the
interstate
commerce
act
cullom
committee
that
people
were
being
injured
by
improper
classification
or
by
diversity
of
the
classification
that
was
one
in
the
east
called
the
official
classification,
one
in
the
south
and
one
in
the
west,
an
individual
carriers
have
their
own
classifications.
but
the
cullom
committee
did
not
give
the
commission
the
power
to
prescribe
rates
and
it
said
nothing
about
classifications.
in
the
hepburn
act
of
1906,
the
commission
was
given
the
power
to
fix
a
rate.
therefore,
it
could
just
declare
it
unreasonable
then
it
would
have
to
go
into
court
and
get
the
aid
of
a
court
to
enjoin
--
enforce
its
orders.
the
hepburn
act
of
1906
gave
the
commission
the
power
to
prescribe
rates.
but
this
was
thought
to
be
inadequate
since
the
amount
of
transportation
charges
could
be
affected
by
a
change
in
classification
as
well
as
the
change
in
rates.
now,
i
submit
that
the
legislative
history
shows
very
clearly
that
the
purpose
of
1(6)
is
to
govern
the
applica
--
to
--
to
command
reasonable
as
of
classification
for
use
in
connection
with
class
rates.
the
senate
--
a
report
of
the
senate
bill
stated
some
doubt
has
been
raised
as
to
whether
under
the
provisions
of
section
15
of
the
existing
act
the
commission
is
empowered
to
review
classification
of
freight
as
well
as
rates
and
to
make
orders
dealing
with
improper
classifications.
by
section
9
of
the
bill,
this
doubt
is
removed
and
the
power
is
expressly
vested
in
the
commission.
similarly,
mr.
russell,
a
member
of
the
house
committee
which
is
in-charge
of
the
bill
stated
that
he
had
been
informed
and
i
quote,
“the
shipper
can
be
extorted
from,
he
can
be
made
to
pay
an
unjust
rate
just
as
well
through
classifications
as
he
can
through
the
fixing
of
a
rate.
the
carrier
can
put
the
article
in
one
classification
subject
to
a
given
rate
and
if
the
icc
sees
fit
to
declare
that
rate
unreasonable
and
reduce
it
declaring
much
over
the
reasonable
rate
to
take
its
place
that
carrying
corporation
can
obtain
the
same
benefit
and
put
the
shipper
under
the
same
disadvantage
by
simply
changing
the
classification
of
the
freight.”
and
then
mr.
mann,
senator
mann,
the
chairman
of
the
committee
and
the
man
who's
named
the
bill
bears
stated
that
classification
of
freight
is
just
as
important
as
rates
because
by
moving
a
particular
article
from
one
class
to
another,
you
affect
the
rates.
so
i
submit
that
this
congressional
history
clearly
shows
that
the
problem
that
congress
was
trying
to
solve
by
the
enactment
of
section
1(6)
was
the
problem
of
ensuring
reasonable
classification
for
use
in
connection
with
class
rates.
the
first
important
case
after
the
enactment
of
1(6)
was
the
western
classification
case
decided
in
1912.
and
there,
the
commission
stated
and
i
quote,
“at
the
present
time,
the
three
great
classifications
official
flying
in
the
east,
western
and
southern
subject
to
exception
sheets
and
commodity
rates
are
the
only
classifications
applying
to
interstate
traffic.
and
these
three
classifications,
the
only
ones
applying
to
interstate
traffic
applied
only
in
fixing
classification
ratings
for
use
in
connection
with
class
rates.
and
in
that
same
case,
the
commission
said
this
and
i
think
it
is
highly
significant
and
i
would
like
to
quote
it,
it's
just
about
five
lines.
“classification
is
an
art
or
science
in
itself.
the
correct
method
of
procedure,”
i'm
doing
a
little
skipping
here
but
it
doesn't
change
the
substance.
“the
correct
method
of
procedure
is
that
the
uniform
classification
must
be
worked
out
without
an
attempt
to
affect
revenues.
classification
and
rates
and
revenues
should
be
kept
entirely
separate.
it
would
only
complicate
and
confuse
matters
to
attempt
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
classification
to
bring
about
a
revision
in
rates
and
charges
whether
a
rate
is
too
high
or
too
low
should
be
made
a
separate
and
distinct
issue
from
classification.
it
seems
very
clear,
therefore,
that
the
commission
considered
classification
of
freight
as
something
to
be
used
in
connection
with
the
application
of
class
rates.
it
could
hardly
have
considered
reasonable
classification
requirement
of
1(6)
to
apply
to
commodity
rates
and
yet
say
as
it
did
that
classification
and
rates
should
be
kept
entirely
separate.
even
in
the
present
case,
your
honors,
the
examiner
who
held
against
us
apparently
could
not
get
out
of
his
mind
that
classification
within
1(6)
is
that
applying
to
class
rates
for
he
said,
“the
examiner
finds
and
concludes
that
the
rates
tend
to
vitiate
and
undermine
the
uniform
freight
classification
which
i
interpolate
is
something
applying
to
class
rates
in
violation
of
section
1(6)
of
the
act.
the
rates
he
said
undermine
and
tend
to
vitiate
and
tend
undermine
the
uniform
freight
classification.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
if
your
honor
please,
there
--
let
me
say
it
first
that
i
think
that
it
was
so
generally
assumed
that
classification
--
the
classification
provision
related
to
class
rates
that
the
matter
did
not
come
up
until
--
i
mean
squarely
until
one
a
case
involving
all
commodity
rates
such
as
we
have
here
and
the
commission
held
that
the
provision
did
not
apply
and
i'll
discuss
that
after
the
noon
recess.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
i
was
about
to
discuss
the
case
entitled
all
freight
to
the
pacific
coast.
a
decision
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
passing
upon
the
lawfulness
of
all
commodity
rates
under
section
1(6)
of
the
act.
and
i
think
that
the
position
that
1(6)
is
violated
by
all
commodity
rates
is
best
summed
up
by
quoting
a
sentence
from
the
dissenting
opinion
of
commissioner
alldredge.
commissioner
alldredge
was
the
great
champion
of
the
idea
that
the
reasonable
classification
provision
applied
not
only
in
connection
with
class
rates
but
commodity
rates
as
well.
and
he
said,
“the
significance
of
classification
should
be
considered
in
its
broadest
sense
that
is
as
furnishing
a
comprehensive
basis
system
with
the
distribution
of
the
general
rate
burden
and
the
establishment
of
rate
relations.
and
so
regarded
it
necessarily
embraces
commodity
rates
as
well
as
so
called
class
rates.”
the
majority
of
the
commission
answered
this
by
stating,
“respondents
now
maintain
a
full
line
of
class
rates
in
governed
by
the
western
classification
from
and
to
all
points
involved
in
this
proceeding
as
required
by
section
1(6)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.”
and
then
a
little
bit
later
it
said,
“class
rates
normally
reflect
the
maximum
of
reasonableness
on
good
falling
within
the
various
classes
of
traffic.
commodity
rates
are
established”
and
then
i'm
skipping
a
little
bit
“when
circumstances
and
conditions
suggest
the
class
basis
is
too
high
for
application
on
the
traffic.”
and
then
this
very
significant
statement,
“we
have
approved
this
basis
of
ratemaking
and
have
never
required
commodity
rate
to
conform
to
the
ratings
of
the
classification.”
a
little
later
on
it
said,
“all
rates
are
required
to
be
just
and
reasonable,
nondiscriminatory
and
non-prejudicial.
to
require
carriers
to
maintain
rates
only
on
a
classification
basis
would
make
section
1(6)
paramount
to
all
other
sections
of
the
act.”
commissioner
eastman
in
his
concurring
opinion
stated,
“as
is
well
known
the
classification
of
freight
which
the
railroads
published,
clasifications
of
freight
which
the
railroads
publish
are
for
the
purpose
of
governing
the
application
of
their
class
rates.”
he
then
went
on
to
state
--
well
that's
an
offer
on
commissioner
eastman
at
that
point.
commissioner
webb
in
his
dissent
in
this
case
stated
that
the
legislative
and
historical
background
of
section
1(6)
leaves
no
doubt
that
the
requirement
of
classification
was
intended
to
reinforce
the
commission's
power
to
establish
maximum
reasonable
rates
but
not
to
prohibit
or
restrain
competitively
compelled
departures
from
the
classification.
and
the
reference
there,
the
maximum
reasonable
rate
is
that
the
highest
rates
that
are
in
the
tariffs
are
the
class
rates.
that
decision
in
all
freight
to
the
pacific
coast
was
challenged
in
a
district
court
of
three
judges
in
washington.
and
the
commission's
order
was
sustained.in
another
major
case
involving
all
commodity
rates
it
was
again
held
by
the
commission
that
1(6)
did
not
apply
and
that
was
all
freight
rates
to
point
in
southern
territory
which
of
course
we
have
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
no,
no
it
is
not
your
honor.
class
rates
are
also
apply
on
many
carload
movements.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
yes,
there
would
be
--
there
would
be
your
honor.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
in
carload
lots,
there
would
be
and
of
course
it
is
important
to
those
people
who
do
ship
on
class
rates
today,
although
the
number
is
getting
smaller
but
to
those
who
do,
it's
very
important
that
their
classification
be
reasonable
as
well
as
their
rates.
ordinarily,
the
classification
assigns
a
lower
class
--
a
lower
classification
rating
for
carloads
than
less
than
carloads
on
the
same
commodity.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
that
is
correct
sir.
now,
the
commission
states
in
its
brief
that
the
commission
has
consistently
scrutinize
the
reasonableness
of
freight
classifications
in
the
passing
on
commodity
rates.
but
a
careful
reading
of
the
cases
that
it
cites
on
that
proposition
will
show
that
in
doing
so,
it
was
applying
the
provisions
of
section
1(5)
as
to
reasonable
rates,
section
2
as
to
unjust
discrimination,
or
section
3
as
to
undue
prejudice.
and
in
none
of
them
did
it
rely
upon
section
1(6)
of
the
act.
i
believe
that
this
is
the
first
case
in
which
the
entire
commission
has
applied
section
1(6)
to
commodity
rates.
there
are
two
decisions
of
the
division
three
--
division
two
of
the
commission
in
which
1(6)
was
invoke
against
commodity
rates.
and
those
are
very
interesting
for
this
reason.
as
i
have
said
district
commissioner
alldredge
was
the
great
champion
of
the
idea
that
1(6)
applied
to
commodity
as
well
as
class
rates.
he
didn't
persuade
anybody,
any
of
his
colleagues
that
that
was
so
except
commissioner
johnson.
and
in
these
two
cases,
commissioners
alldredge
and
johnson
constituted
the
majority
of
division
2
of
the
commission
which
consists
of
three
men.
the
third
man
did
not
concur
in
their
opinions.
but
other
than
those,
i
think
there
are
no
decisions
holding
1(6)
applicable
to
commodity
rates
although
it's
been
on
the
books
since
1910.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
well,
i
think
it's
this,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
we
have
now
enacted
by
congress,
section
15a(3),
the
object
of
which
was
to
give
the
railroads
greater
freedom
in
making
competitive
rates
and
to
indicate
the
rules
which
should
apply.
and
that
is
to
say
that
they
could
meet
competition
and
make
rates
lower
as
low
as
they
wanted
to
regarded
as
necessary
to
meet
the
competition
provided
they
didn't
take
away
an
inherent
advantage
of
one
of
the
competing
carriers.
now,
of
course,
the
railroads
drill
for
a
long
time
to
get
that
legislation
and
here
it
is
just
fresh
on
the
books.
and
the
commission
invokes
section
1(6)
and
says,
“now,
in
addition
to
meeting
the
requirements
that
you
have
always
had
to
meet,
in
addition
to
meeting
the
standards
of
section
15a(3)
recently
enacted,
you
must
now
also
meet
classification
principles.”
now,
classification
principles
have
taken
a
rather
classic
form
in
which
certain
elements
are
considered,
one
of
which
is
value
of
the
commodity.
and
the
idea
has
been
that
value
of
the
commodity.
it
means
that
something
of
high
value
can
take
higher
rates
and
something
of
low
value
will
take
lower
rates.
and
of
course
that
was
all
well
and
good
when
the
railroads
had
a
monopoly
and
the
man
had
to
ship
by
railroad.
but
if
you
tell
a
man
that
now,
he'll
go
around
the
corner
to
see
a
trucker
and
if
he
can't
get
what
he
wants
from
the
trucker,
he'll
buy
a
truck.
and
he
can
hold
diamonds
in
that
truck
just
as
cheaply
as
he
can
call
coal.
and
i
don't
want
to
get
into
discussion
of
value
of
service.
but
i
believe
that
that
is
what
the
district
court
had
in
mind
when
it
was
talking
about
value
of
service
here.
that
is
to
say
value
of
the
commodity.
but
at
all
events,
our
fear
is
that
if
the
commission
imposes
the
requirement
that
in
judging
the
lawfulness
of
competitive
rates,
it's
going
to
judge
them
also
by
whether
they
conformed
to
classification
principles
were
going
to
be
met
with
a
frustration
of
the
purpose
of
section
15a(3)
because
the
commission
will
condemn
them,
because
they
don't
confrm
to
classification
practices
and
say,
“oh
yes,
if
they
are
right
under
15a(3)
but
basically
they
don't
conform
to
something
that
for
years
we've
been
doing”
namely
applying
classification
principles.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
oh
no,
your
honor,
they
have
been
--
and
they
were
in
effect
even
before
the
interstate
commerce
act
was
passed
but
used
much
less
frequently.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
yes.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
that's
what
the
--
i
believe
the
lower
court
said
99%,
it's
95
anyway
maybe
99,
i
don't
know.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
oh,
yes,
yes.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
well
there'd
be
competition
between
railroads
or
competition
with
railroads
and
waterlines
or
perhaps
in
many
situations
in
order
to
get
the
traffic
to
market,
it
wouldn't
move
if
the
rate
was
too
high
say
it
was
on
--
in
certain
circumstances
at
least
it
wouldn't.
now,
the
classification
was
something
that
applied
all
over
a
territory.
for
example
here
in
the
east,
mr.
commissioner,
the
official
classification
applied
just
about
from
the
atlantic
sea
board
to
the
mississippi
river
and
north
of
the
ohio.
now,
fixed
the
classification
rating
for
that
whole
territory.
between
certain
points
from
the
territory
there
may
have
been
need
by
reason
of
some
competitive
factor
to
make
a
lower
rate.
so
instead
of
dislodging
the
classification
applying
generally,
they
just
made
a
commodity
rate
to
apply
between
those
points.
now,
the
government
attempts
to
distinguish
all
freight
to
the
pacific
coast
on
the
ground
that's
the
--
all
commodity
rates
in
effect
there
or
approved
there
were
higher
than
the
individual
rates
on
individual
commodities
embraced
within
the
all
commodity
group.
and
i
submit
that
that
is
really
a
very
superficial
distinction.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
idea
that
an
all
commodity
rate
does
not
offend
classification
principles
if
it
is
higher
than
the
individual
rates
on
individual
commodities
completely
overlooks
the
fact
that
the
individual
rates
themselves
were
made
without
reference
to
classification
principles.
so
i
submit
that
that
is
no
distinction
at
all.
and
moreover,
the
commission's
reference
to
the
fact
in
its
decision
was
to
distinguish
two
other
cases
on
the
grounds
of
undue
preference
and
prejudice
and
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
application
of
section
1(6).
so
i
submit,
if
you
honors
please,
that
commodity
rates
are
not
within
the
purpose
of
section
1(6)
in
the
commission's
decisions
up
to
this
time.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
more
or
less.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
they
--
there
doesn't
have
to
be
--
there
doesn't
have
to
be,
mr.
commissioner,
but
they
are
pretty
fixed.
they're
stated
on
page
10
of
the
government's
brief.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
a.
kaier
your
honor,
if
i
may
interpolate
at
this
point,
you
will
notice
that
nearly
all
of
these
relate
to
cost
factors,
things
that
affect
cost
to
transportation.
and
new
haven's
rates
really
comport
very
well
with
the
cost
factors.
it's
really
just
the
value
of
factor,
the
value
of
the
commodity
that
is
not
considered
by
those
rates
but
that's
neither
here
or
nor
there
from
the
standpoint
of
your
decision
of
the
issue
here.
just
to
summarize
then,
i
submit,
that
commodity
rates
are
not
within
the
purpose
of
section
1(6).
they
are
not
within
the
legislative
history
of
the
reason
for
enacting
section
1(6).
the
commission
up
to
this
case,
ever
since
1910,
has
not
applied
them
to
commodity
rates.
and
if
they
are
