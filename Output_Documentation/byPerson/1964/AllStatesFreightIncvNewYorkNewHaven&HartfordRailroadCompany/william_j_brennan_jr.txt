(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
have
been.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
it
tell
us
here
what
the
revenues
would
have
been
had
this
traffic
would
have
been
moved,
is
that
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
if
they
had
not
listed
this
for
four
million
pounds
in
those
cars,
those
cars
in
any
event
would
have
had
to
move
westward
entry,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
it
doesn't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
me
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
i'm
moving
the
formula
in
pounds;
they
do
get
additional
revenue
don't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
have
trouble
seeing
how
that
cost
them
even
more.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
the
finding
at
how
much
more
it
cost
to
move
four
million
pounds
than
it
would
have
cost
them,
have
they
sent
the
car
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
probably
where
i'm
having
my
difficulty
here,
i
don't
understand
why
it
carries
with
it
this
concept
as
a
necessary
interest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
probably
wrong
about
it
but
i
don't
see
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
hadn't
they
--
they
obviously
have
closed
to
handle
those
empty
boxcars,
hadn't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
say
mr.
carpenter
that
on
the
piggyback
shipment,
there
could
be
a
maximum
of
two
tons,
one
of
which
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
then
i
gather
the
balance
could
be
in
a
95
or
a
hundred
different
thing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
how
does
that
differ
on
these
boxcars
and
so
i
think
justice
black
and
i
would
dissent
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
can
have
a
hundred
different
items
or
a
single
item?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
single
item
100%
of
weight?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what
difference
does
that
make?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
example,
just
pick
an
item
i
suppose
it's
not
a
good
one
but
let's
pick
furniture
--
well,
let's
just
take
chairs,
identical
chairs.
and
the
regular
rate
is
10
cents
and
this
rate
is
four
cents,
we
then
send
a
boxcar
full
of
chairs
at
four
cents
instead
of
10,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
mr.
ginnane
what
do
you
mean
vacated?does
that
mean
as
a
matter
of
having
force
of
law
of
the
opinion?
but
you
didn't
--
you
don't
have
the
problem
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you're
not
asking
us
if
i
understand
it
to
reinstate
the
commission
on
their
requirement,
on
the
contrary.
you're
telling
us
that
what
you
want
to
do
is
we
reconsider
on
some
of
these
things
and
perhaps
maybe
come
with
a
different
finding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
in
that
--
i
don't
see
really
why
the
commission
is
urging
us
to
decide
these
questions
which
that
the
--
that
was
all
that
suggested
the
abstract
the
basis
of
the
findings
of
the
commission.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
well
--
but
really
on
that
you
know
when
something
like
this
comes
to
you,
what's
our
option?
it's
either
to
affirm
or
to
note
that
the
three
judges
determination
on
the
mere
fact
that
to
note
doesn't
mean
necessarily
to
the
court.
or
whether
we're
going
to
decide
the
issue
as
we
saw,
but
that's
the
only
way
we
can
reach
it
rightly
and
not
quite
this,
as
another
search.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
vacated
at
once.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
could
have
a
total
of
15
million
tons
in
a
position
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you've
mentioned
classification
principles
overtime,
is
there
(inaudible)
principles?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
are
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
i
see,
in
the
footnote?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
your
three-day
average
still
maintained?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
to
say
that
--
that
piggyback
is
getting
now
much
more
profit,
you
both
were
utilizing
these
empty
boxcars
whether
they're
not
to
be
utilized.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
even
though
compatible
with
piggyback
than
a
more
desirable
service.
