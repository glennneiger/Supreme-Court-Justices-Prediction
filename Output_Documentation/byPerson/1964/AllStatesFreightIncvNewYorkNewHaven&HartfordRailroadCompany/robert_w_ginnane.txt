mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
commission
on
the
united
states
did
not
appeal
from
the
judgment
below.
rather,
at
the
time
the
motor
carriers
took
an
appeal,
we
filed
to
the
court
a
memorandum
stating
in
part
that
while
the
commission
believes
that
the
district
court's
decision
was
based
upon
an
erroneous
interpretation
of
section
1(6)
and
of
the
national
transportation
policy,
still
entertained
some
doubt
as
to
the
adequacy
of
its
findings
in
relation
to
the
matters
relied
upon
by
the
district
court.
and
therefore,
the
commission
voted
rather
than
to
appeal
to
this
court,
to
reopen
the
proceedings
for
further
consideration.
we
now
join
with
the
motor
carrier
appellants
here
in
urging
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed
but
while
they
asked
that
the
court
below
be
directed
to
dismiss
the
complaint,
it
is
still
the
view
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
commission
that
upon
reversal,
the
proceedings
should
be
remanded
to
the
commission
for
further
consideration.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we
aren't
always
certain.
for
example,
in
the
south
carolina
train
discontinuance
case
which
we
had
before
this
court
last
term.
that
form
judgment
clearly
would
have
prevented
the
commission
from
reopening.
other
judgments
of
three-judge
courts
will
be
quite
to
the
contrary.
well,
remand
or
set
aside
the
commission's
order,
remand
it
to
the
commission
for
further
proceedings
is
consistent
with
the
court's
opinion.
and
in
many
instances,
i
think
the
court
probably
doesn't
specifically
think
about
it.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
found
that
the
commission's
order
was
invalid
and
enjoined
its
enforcement.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
that's
right
on
reopening.
the
commission
might
have
arrived
at
the
same
result
by
a
different
route
or
indeed
at
a
different
result.
after
all
there
were
three
--
there
were
three
dissenting
commissioners
and
we
lived
on
an
era
of
very
rapid
competitive
and
technological
change
in
this
great
making
area.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we
say
that
the
court
below
erred
in
two
major
respects.
but
the
commission
feels
that
that
even
with
a
reversal
of
the
decision
below
that
it
should
discuss
some
features
of
this
case
in
more
detail,
further
explication
that
it
did.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
because
sir,
i
believe
that
they
would
leave
both
the
commission
and
the
parties
at
large
and
uncertain
on
the
two
matters
--
on
the
two
rulings
of
law
of
the
court
below.
those
rulings
were
first
that
section
1(6)
applies
only
to
class
rates,
has
no
application
to
commodity
rates.
and
secondly,
that
the
value
of
service
pricing
principle
was
outlawed
as
a
matter
of
law
by
them
--
by
the
enactment
of
the
national
transportation
policy
in
1940.
i
respectfully
urge
that
the
commission
and
the
parties
need
to
know
where
they
stand
on
those
two
matters
or
we
could
go
no
further.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
except
by
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well
it's
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
in
effect
sir,
that's
why
the
government
didn't
take
an
appeal.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
don't
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
don't
see
it
how
it
could
be,
giving
the
district
court's
opinion
a
fair
reading.
it
seems
to
me,
they
hold
as
flatly
as
they
can
that
their
classification
of
property
provisions
of
section
1(6)
apply
only
to
the
class
rate
structure
and
cannot
be
applied
--
do
not
apply
to
commodity
rates
of
any
kind.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
that's
the
fair
reading
of
it.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
then
there
is
the
--
and
then
there
is
the
further
holding.
we
think
our
fair
reading
is
very
flat
that
the
value
of
service
concept
in
pricing
was
outlawed
as
a
matter
of
law
since
1940.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
and
the
others.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
or
tried
to
come
back
as
it
were
to
--
to
use
the
popular
case,
to
come
back
and
continue
the
dialogue
with
that
court.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
frankly,
we
would
not
have
accepted
it
for
all
time
and
for
the
entire
united
states.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
points
are
much
too
great
importance
for
the
entire
transportation
system.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
you
had
--
this
court
have
something
of
the
same
problem
in
the
new
haven
competitive
rate
case
which
came
up
here
that
--
which
you
decided
two
years
ago.
now,
there
--
there
the
same
three
judge
court
in
new
haven
had
extensive
discussion
--
hostile
discussion
to
the
value
service
pricing.
but
in
this
court,
this
court,
they
found
it
unnecessary
to
go
into
that
area
at
all.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh,
not
the
facts
--
the
commission's
findings
and
discussions.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
because
i'm
in
this
position
and
the
case
is
here,
the
court
has
noted
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i'm
sure
the
court
has
done
all
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well
sir,
it
would
be
more
involved
in
correcting
an
opinion.
because
if
the
court
below
was
wrong
--
was
wrong
in
those
two
propositions
of
law,
i
assume
that
its
judgment
cannot
stand.
the
judgment
below
would
have
to
be
reversed.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
could
well
be.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
i
can
only
say
--
again,
reminding
you
sir
that
we
did
not
ask
the
court
that.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
i
submit
that
if
not
--
that
this
is
not
quite
declaratory.
i
submit
that
the
judgment
below
simply
cannot
stand.
if
the
court
--
if
the
court
is
wrong,
i
mean
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
has
to
be
taken
into
account
so
far
as
changing
economic
transportation
circumstances
from
them.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
think
that's
absolutely
right.
whether
there
is
rapid
shifted
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
can't
quarrel
with
your
suggestion.
the
government
cannot
quote
over
that.
we
were
content
to
accept
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
appeal
--
the
appeal
to
the
court.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
with
--
but
with
the
case
here,
it
seemed
less
important
that
--
and
that
we
participate
in
brief
and
argument.
we
express
our
view
as
to
the
courts.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well
that
these
are
continuing
problems.
the
carrier
--
has
its
rates
in
effect.
it
is
not
being
hurt.
these
all
commodity
rates
are
rather
common
in
the
united
states
at
this
point.
and
the
question
as
to
what
are
proper
of
commodity
rates
under
the
act
and
in
terms
of
a
development
of
a
sound
transportation
system
are
presently
and
will
be
important
questions.
commission
has
dealt
with
them
again
and
again.
i
should
say
that
motor
carriers
have
done
just
about
as
much
experimenting
with
these
all
commodity
rates
as
railroads
have.
and
many
of
the
commission
decisions
of
this
subject
involve
all
commodity
rates
proposed
by
motor
carriers.
it
so
happens
that
this
is
the
first
litigation
in
which
the
courts
have
really
taken
a
specific
careful
look
at
the
all
commodity
rate
problem.
but
the
commission's
--
the
commission's
books
are
full
of
decisions
on
the
subject.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
sir.
the
commission
did
not
use
the
phrase.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
certainly
on
the
--
certainly
on
the
structure
of
the
decision
below.
because
it
seems
to
us
on
a
fair
reading
and
they
were
coming
back
to
where
they
left
off
in
the
pan
atlantic
case.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
the
commission
was
acting
to
preserve
value
of
the
value
of
service
principle
as
the
court
put
it
in
a
desire
to
hold
fast
to
a
path
of
the
past
which
have
already
slipped
beyond
our
reach.
now,
leaving
aside
any
question
of
--
law
there.
we
respectfully
submit
that
that
was
not
the
court's
rule.
the
commission
is
well
aware
that
the
progressive
development
of
intermodal
competition
that
the
ability
of
railroads
to
obtain
from
a
high
value
of
traffic
--
a
higher
rate
of
traffic,
a
higher
contribution
to
overhead,
then
lower
rate
of
traffic
is
--
has
been
progressively
impaired.
but
that
impairment
varies
as
between
commodities
and
between
competitive
points
and
between
competitive
areas.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
what
i'm
saying
to
you
now,
sir,
is
practically
a
matter
of
common
knowledge.
that
their
existing
railroad
rate
structure
still,
to
an
amazing
extent
and
involves
value
of
service
pricing.
if
then
--
they're
going
study
departure
value,
permitted
by
the
commission
under
the
pressure
of
--
of
competitive
and
technological
change
and
--
and
may
well
continue.
but
it
shows
up
in
the
price
structure
to
this
extent
that
the
category
of
manufactured
commodities
alone
produces
a
far
greater
contribution
to
railroad
overhead
than
the
entire
product
of
mines,
forest
and
agriculture.
now,
that
may
not
always
be
true,
but
unless
congress
specifically
commenced,
surely
the
congress
--
surely
the
commission
is
not
required
to
shift
to
a
cost-basis
exclusively
overnight
and
the
sudden
abandonment
of
value
of
service
pricing.
believe
me,
it
would
produce
a
vast
economic
dislocation
of
this
country,
primarily
for
shippers
whose
plants
and
markets
have
been
developed
in
reliance
upon
a
rate
structure
which
still
includes
a
great
deal
of
value
of
service
pricing.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
low
rates?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
correct
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
correct,
sir.
now,
as
commission
changed,
there
maybe
less
and
less
justification
or
need,
or
even
possibility
for
value
of
service
pricing
in
the
system.
and
that
we
submit
that
what
is
needed
and
i
quote
a
former
--
our
late
commissioner
johnson,
“is
an
orderly
transition
from
a
justifiable
past
practice
to
one
that
recognizes
and
gives
effect
to
the
exigencies
of
the
price.”
that
transition
is
already
in
progress.
it
has
been
for
years.
and
it
may
continue
under
competitive
and
technological
pressures.
and
if
so,
it'll
be
a
good
thing.
it
will
be
what
the
system
needs.
but
to
say
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
congress
said,
“outlaw”;
the
application
of
value
of
service
pricing
in
1940
with
the
national
transportation
act.
we
submit
has
absolutely
no
support
in
the
language
or
history
of
the
national
transportation
policy.
it's
an
extraordinary
discovery
24
years
later.
the
only
specific
thing
in
the
history
of
the
transportation
policy
was
during
the
1940
debates,
on
the
1940
transportation
act
where
senator
wheeler
in
many,
respects
the
father
of
that
act,
stated
flatly
and
we
have
it
in
our
brief,
that
value
of
service
pricing
was
perfectly
consistent
and
properly
applied,
with
the
inherent
advantage
concept
of
the
national
transportation
policy.
and
even
with
the
transportation
act
of
1958,
there
is
not
a
suggestion
that
value
of
service
was
to
be
cut
off
abruptly.
the
railroads
didn't
dare
suggested
either.
and
it's
perfectly
understandable
because
value
of
service
properly
applied
protects
the
revenues
of
the
carrier,
not
of
its
competitors.
