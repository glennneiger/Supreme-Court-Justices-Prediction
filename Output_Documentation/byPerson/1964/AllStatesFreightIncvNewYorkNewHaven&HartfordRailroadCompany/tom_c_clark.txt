justice
tom
c.
clark
aren't
they
taking
freights
from
other
railroads
other
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
now
what
about
the
service
aside
from
that
they
didn't
make
$129,
what
about
the
service
to
the
public
or
to
the
--
to
the
shipper?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
if
they
continue,
they
made
$129
more.
justice
tom
c.
clark
how
did
they
come
out
with
that?
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
about
the
rest
of
the
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
does
section
1(6)
apply
to
piggyback?
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
i'll
take
a
truck
and
put
all
types
of
freight
on
it
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
where
would
it
come,
under
the
classification
of
each
type
of
that
freight
or
it
come
under
the
classification
of
a
piggyback?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
you
can
violate
1(6)
in
a
piggyback
but
you
can't
here.
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
suppose
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
then
that
60-40
here
would
not
be
a
violation?
justice
tom
c.
clark
is
that
in
this
case?
does
this
case
show
what
the
percentage
is?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
put
anything
you
want
to
in
the
car,
don't
you?
justice
tom
c.
clark
on
the
truck
well
you
put
--
you
have
to
put
60%.
justice
tom
c.
clark
on
the
two
trailers.
justice
tom
c.
clark
what?
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
piggyback
did
go,
didn't
it,
on
the
60-40?
is
that
proven
just
for
the
railroad
itself?
justice
tom
c.
clark
are
you
going
to
have
then
do
what
you
have
not
done
here
because
to
me
you
would
have
show
that
the
piggyback
is
distructive
of
the
railroad
and
therefore
violated
national
transportation
policy.
you
haven't
shown
that
here,
haven't
you?
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
you've
showed
and
hurt
you.
you
said
there's
no
evidence,
is
that
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
didn't
base
it
on
there.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i'm
sure
that
the
congress
certainly
intended
that
in
the
national
transportation
policy
to
build
up
its
strong
national
transportation
system.
at
the
same
time,
don't
you
think
that
they
had
a
least
of
the
side
blanks
for
the
--
for
the
shipper?
and
the
convenience
of
him
and
whether
or
not
the
railroad
was
rendering
good
service
to
the
public?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
here
you
have
--
you
have
a
railroad
who
has
picked
up
all
these
additional
traffic.
you
say
it's
only
$129
more
but
you
don't
--
there's
no
finding
showing
who
was
hurt.
and
maybe
they've
picked
up
this
traffic
as
far
as
we
know
from
sources
that
were
using
some
other.
maybe
they're
using
their
own
trucks
or
something
like
that.
we
don't
know
whether
they
took
traffic
away
from
other
railroads
or
not
or
from
you,
from
a
truck.
it
might
have
jammed
up
more
traffic.
it
appears
to
me
because
of
the
nature
of
the
reduction
in
the
rate.
perhaps,
i
might
have
been
using
my
own
trucks
but
when
the
railroad
comes
along
and
says
they
will
do
it
for
four
cents,
i
say
well
that's
cheaper
than
i
can
get
myself
so
i
just
ship
with
them.
justice
tom
c.
clark
then
it
was
picked
out
by
reasonable
deduction.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
know
but
it
was
traffic
that
was
moving
anyway.
justice
tom
c.
clark
only
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
could
bring
another
case
on
another
theory,
couldn't
you?
like
the
damage
to
the
commodities.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
does
the
commission
have
a
substance
(inaudible)
here?
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
should
think
that
the
findings
that
it
made
are
not
adequate
or
to
meet
the
attack
as
now
being
made
upon
the
order.
justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
want
to
do
it
now.
it's
like,
for
me,
you'd
be
less
better
off
if
we
vacated
that
you
submitted
it
on
this
record
because
you
admit
that
the
facts
are
not
sufficient.
justice
tom
c.
clark
find
--
i
mean
the
findings.
so
you
might
suffer
severely,
you
went
on
the
merits
while
it
was
vacated.
you
would
be
much
better
off
and
if
you
would
not
appeal
and
then
you
have
that
standing
as
been
pointed
out
by
(inaudible).
