mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
railroad
rates
for
the
transportation
of
property
in
interstate
commerce.
the
rates
were
published
in
the
spring
of
1959
and
the
case
is
now
five-and-a-half
years
old.
the
rates
were
first
published
by
the
new
haven
railroad
but
were
promptly
followed
by
the
publication
of
equivalent
rates
for
the
new
york
central,
the
boston
and
maine,
the
maine
central,
and
the
central
of
vermont.
generally
speaking,
the
rates
applied
from
the
principal
cities
of
new
england
to
chicago,
illinois
and
st.
louis,
missouri.
certain
midwestern
railroads
which
provided
the
connections
for
the
new
england
lines
to
those
cities
also
became
parties
to
the
rates.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
yes
sir,
westbound
only,
justice
stewart.
the
reason
that
the
new
rates
applied
only
to
those
two
cities
was
by
election
of
the
new
haven
itself.
their
purpose
was
to
compete
with
a
new
plan
of
railroad
service
which
was
trailer-on-flatcar.
it
was
called
plan
iii
and
was
instituted
in
new
england
by
the
new
york
central
in
1958.
the
new
york
central
offered
that
service
and
its
initial
phase
only
to
those
two
cities
and
the
plan
iii
trailer-on-flatcar
service
was
of
a
special
nature.
it
was
provided
that
charges
which
were
essentially
flat
charges
in
the
sense
that
they
were
stated
in
aggregate
sums
of
money
to
apply
for
the
transportation
not
to
exceed
70,000
pounds
of
freight
and
not
to
exceed
two
trailers.
there
was
a
further
restriction
on
those
trailer-on-flatcar
rates
that
--
or
the
trailer-on-flatcar
charges
that
no
one
commodity
in
the
total
shipment
could
exceed
60%
of
the
aggregate
weight
of
the
shipment.
the
tariff
also
provided
that
the
trailers
had
to
be
supplied
by
the
shipper
and
that
the
shipper
likewise
had
to
supply
his
own
bridge
service
between
the
commercial
installation
and
the
railroad
terminal.
as
a
matter
of
actual
practice,
however,
the
new
york
central
was
leasing
trailers
to
shippers
on
a
one
way
trip
lease
and
was
providing
the
bridge
service
both
other
than
tariff
charges.
now,
the
effect
to
this
new
service
on
the
new
haven
railroad
was
immediate.
within
the
first
two
months
that
the
service
was
offered
by
the
new
york
central,
the
new
haven
lost
400
car
loads
of
traffic
to
these
two
destinations
which
it
could
identify.
i
should
also
point
out
that
the
new
haven
had
also
published
these
plan
iii
charges
for
the
new
trailer-on-flatcar
service
but
it
had
some
disabilities.
it
had
two
gateways
to
the
west.
one
at
maybrook,
new
york
and
the
other
one
in
new
york
city
itself,
i
think
the
new
haven
called
the
harlem
river
where
it
made
connection
with
westbound
carriers.
the
clearances
on
both
of
those
routes
were
not
such
as
to
permit
the
standard
size
trailer
on
a
standard
height
boxcar
or
flatcar
to
be
transported.
the
new
haven,
however,
had
been
using
a
special
sort
of
a
car,
they
called
it
a
clisham
car
which
carried
the
trailer
at
the
lower
level
than
an
ordinary
flatcar
but
it
couldn't
very
well
provide
that
service
to
the
west
because
the
unloading
facilities
for
this
specialized
car
were
not
maintained
by
all
of
its
connections.
it
had
under
progress,
however,
a
program
for
eliminating
its
low
occurrences
and
accordingly
it
published
these
new
rates
which
are
an
issue
here
subject
to
an
expiration
date.
the
expiration
date
was
in
september
of
1959
prior
to
at
time
it
came
along
that
expiration
date
was
postponed.
by
september
of
1959,
the
clearance
problems
what
the
new
haven
had
encountered,
had
been
cleared
up
with
respect
to
one
of
its
routes,
the
one
through
maybrook.
and
of
course,
that
gave
it
access
to
the
both
--
both
cities
that
is
chicago
and
st.louis.
moreover
it
--
it
also
secured
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission
by
that
time,
permission
to
substitute
two
short
flatcars
for
one
long
one.
the
original
plan
iii
contemplated
that
there
would
be
two
trailers
to
each
flatcar
and
the
new
haven
didn't
have
long
flatcars.
i
mentioned
these
matters
because
i
think
it's
important
due
to
the
fact
that
the
new
haven,
even
after
it
had
eliminated
its
difficulties
that
i
have
spoken
of
and
was
in
a
position
to
secure
the
traffic
under
plan
iii
continued
nonetheless
to
press
for
approval
of
these
rates.
this
was
recognized
by
the
commission
in
its
decision.
when
the
rates
were
first
published,
they
were
suspended
on
the
petition
of
the
appellants
here.
then
later,
that
suspension
was
vacated
upon
petition
of
the
railroads.
however,
the
commission
continued
its
investigation
which
had
instituted
the
time
the
suspension
took
place.
now
by
the
provisions,
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
burden
of
justifying
a
change
in
freight
rates
is
upon
the
proponent
of
that
change
that
the
hearing
which
the
commission
held,
only
the
new
haven
undertook
the
discharge
effort.
the
other
railroads
simply
stated
that
they
published
the
rates
for
the
purpose
of
remaining
competitive
with
the
new
haven
itself.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
there
were
several,
the
new
york
central,
they
were
the
new
york
central,
the
boston
and
maine,
the
maine
central
and
the
central
of
vermont.
those,
justice
white,
were
the
originating
roads
in
new
england.
the
roads
which
made
connections
or
the
ones
that
didn't
have
their
own
lines
to
chicago
and
st.
louis
joined
with
them
in
the
publication
of
the
rates.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
no,
no,
it
was
not.
the
rates
were
stated
to
apply
upon
traffic
that
was
transported
in
boxcars.
and
i
should
point
out
here
that
the
new
haven
had
a
surplus
of
these
boxcars
for
westbound
move.
the
rates
were
expressed
in
cents
per
100
pounds
but
they
were
graded
by
reference
to
the
amount
of
weight
in
a
given
shipment.
that
is
to
say
that
the
highest
of
these
rates
was
at
45%
of
first
class
and
it
applied
to
shipments
of
20,000
pounds
minimum
weight
and
the
rates
were
graded
downward
as
the
minimum
weights
increased
by
10,000
pounds
increments
until
at
70,000
pounds
the
rates
were
19%
of
first
class.
the
rates
had
application
upon
virtually
any
commodity.
the
only
exceptions
were
livestock,
perishables,
explosives
and
articles
highly
susceptible
to
damage.
with
those
limited
exclusions,
it
applied
where
the
rates
applied
whether
the
shipments
were
in
single
commodity
carloads
or
in
carloads
of
mixed
commodities.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
yes,
that's
true,
for
instance
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
as
a
practical
matter,
yes,
the
rates
were
--
the
rates
were
restricted
to
transportation
in
boxcars,
your
honor.
in
addition,
the
rates
had
alternative
application
with
all
the
other
boxcar
rates.
by
that,
i
mean
that
if
there
was
a
lower
rate
published
for
any
particular
commodity
for
boxcar
movement,
that
lower
rate
would
apply.
these
rates
serve
only
to
mark
the
ceiling
at
which
the
railroad
charge
would
be
computed.
after
hearing
in
briefs,
the
rates
were
found
unlawful
by
the
commission's
hearing
examiner
because
they
are
violative
of
section
1(6)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
we
have
set
that
out
at
page
2
of
our
brief
here.
i'm
sorry,
it's
at
page
3,
the
middle
of
the
page,
and
it
reads
in
part
as
follows.
“it
is
hereby
made
the
duty
of
all
common
carriers
subject
to
the
provisions
of
this
part
to
establish,
observe,
and
enforce
just
and
reasonable
classifications
of
property
for
transportation
with
reference
to
which
rates,
tariffs,
regulations
or
practices
are/or
maybe
made
or
prescribed
in
just
and
reasonable
regulations
and
practices
affecting
classifications,
rates,
or
tariffs.”
the
section
goes
on
to
deal
with
other
matters.
the
railroads
filed
exceptions
to
the
report
of
the
examiner
and
division
2
of
the
commission
consisting
of
three
commissioners
of
whom
commissioner
fritz
dissented,
held
that
the
rates
are
not
violative
of
section
1(6)
in
as
much
as
they
were
held
to
be
justified
by
the
particular
circumstances
of
this
case.
commissioner
fritz
dissented
upon
the
grounds
that
all
freight
rates
or
all
commodity
rates
such
as
these
are
on
straight
shipments,
can
be
justified
under
only
special
circumstances
which
he
felt
were
not
present
here.
these
appellants
then
petitioned
the
entire
commission
as
at
that
time
we
had
a
right
to
do
for
reconsideration
of
the
report
by
division
2.
in
the
entire
commission
with
three
commissioners
dissenting,
issued
its
report
which
condemned
these
rates
on
two
grounds.
first,
it
was
held
that
the
rates
constitute
a
destructive
competitive
practice
in
contravention
of
the
national
transportation
policy
and
second,
that
the
rates
do
violate
the
provisions
of
section
1(6)
of
the
act.
now,
these
two
conclusions
were
very
intimately
related
and
they
stem,
we
believe,
from
a
single
basis.
that
was
the
fact
that
as
demonstrated
by
the
evidence
of
record
before
the
commission,
these
all
freight
rates
which
have
been
established
for
the
new
haven
and
with
respect
to
which
the
evidence
all
related
operated
to
hurt
rather
than
to
help
the
new
haven
financially.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
to
both,
your
honor.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
yes,
yes,
your
honor,
to
both
though,
not
just
to
the
new
haven.
the
new
haven
court
--
and
i
would
touch
on
this
later.
the
court
below
in
an
earlier
decision
had
itself
defined
the
destructive
competitive
practice
as
one
which
is
harmful
to
the
proponent
of
it
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
--
and
also,
harmful
to
its
competitors.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
i
think
so.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
there
is
a
holding
here
that
it
was
both.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
holding
was
that
--
i'm
sure
the
holding
was
that
this
practice
would
be
destructive
of
just
and
reasonable
rate
structures
upon
which
carriers
and
shippers
alike
depend
for
adequate
service,
the
maintenance
of
adequate
service.
now,
there
was
no
holding
that
this
would
be
harmful
to
the
motor
carriers.
we
didn't
litigate
on
that
basis
or
at
least
the
commission
didn't
decide
on
that
basis.
we
had
urged
that
before
the
commission
--
commission
had
no
--
no
finding
on
it.
the
commission
made
two
findings
in
connection
with
this
ultimate
conclusion
and
also
with
respect
to
this
evidence
relating
to
the
injury
to
the
new
haven
as
well
as
to
the
other
carriers
through
the
destruction
of
the
rate
structure.
the
first
was
that
the
rates
applied
to
straight
car
loads
and
displaced
all
other
higher
car
load
rates.
they
represented
the
highest
level,
the
commission
said,
at
which
the
bulk
of
the
new
haven's
westbound
traffic
were
moved.
the
second
finding
concerned
this
study
which
actually
moved
--
or
of
the
traffic
which
actually
moved
on
these
all
freight
rates
which
have
been
referred
to
by
the
commission
in
its
decision
as
section
2
rates.
that
was
by
reason
of
fact
that
they
were
published
in
section
2
of
a
given
tariff.
that
study
covered
a
period
of
11
weeks.
the
new
haven
had
analyzed
those
shipments
to
determine
which
of
them
consisted
the
movements
which
they
had
afford
in
taking
place
by
way
of
the
new
haven
itself
at
its
preexisting
rates
in
which
have
been
attracted
to
the
new
section
2
rates
from
some
other
service.
the
study
showed
and
the
commission
found
the
fact
that
the
new
traffic
which
had
been
attracted
by
the
all
freight
rates
amounted
to
more
than
four
million
pounds
during
this
11-week
period
but
that
the
total
revenue
for
both
the
new
and
the
old
traffic
had
not
appreciably
increased
over
that
which
would
have
accrued
that
the
old
traffic
been
handled
the
old
rates.
i
would
like
to
read
at
this
time
from
page
12
of
the
printed
record.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
yes,
there
was.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
no,
no,
that
--
that
would
not
have
followed.
this
and
the
--
that
they
had
handled
four
million
additional
pounds
of
traffic
at
substantially
the
same
gross
revenue.
now
obviously,
the
gross
revenue
--
it
caused
the
railroad
to
handle
that
four
million
pounds
and
the
commission
recognized
this
because
it
said,
and
i
read
from
page
12
of
the
printed
record
here,
“thus
for
this
period”
and
the
commission
was
referring
to
the
11-week
period,
“the
respondent”,
that's
the
new
haven,
“moved
over
four
million
pounds
of
additional
traffic
in
return
for
$129
of
added
revenue.
this
represents
less
than
one-third
of
ascending
revenue
for
each
additional
100
pounds
of
traffic
moved.”
the
commission
then
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
evidence
respecting
costs
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
that
the
--
true,
true.
they
lost
money.
i
--
i
meant
to
convey
this
impression,
they
lost
money
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
they
handled
--
they
had
to
handle
the
additional
traffic
for
so
very
little
money.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
that's
right.
they
lost
money
over
what
they
would
have
made
had
they
hadn't
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
--
put
in
these
rates
and
handle
that.
commission
then
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
evidence
respecting
cost
had
indicated
that
the
--
all
freight
rates
would
recover
operating
cost
both
out-of-pocket
and
fully
distributed
and
commented
that
the
earlier
report
by
division
2
was
based
primarily
on
that
fact.
the
commission
commented
there
that
right
after
its
finding
with
respect
to
the
special
study
that
these
new
section
2
rates
have
been
shown
to
return
revenues
which
were
in
excess
of
the
out-of-pocket
cost
of
providing
a
service
and
also,
the
fully
distributed
cost.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
yes
because
in
the
aggregate
--
in
the
aggregate,
justice
white,
the
railroad
was
worst
off
by
reasonable
rates
than
it
would
have
been
without
and
that's
what
the
study
showed.
let
me
diverge
here
because
this
is
a
--
an
important
aspect
of
the
case
on
this
matter
of
cost.
there
is,
i
think,
an
inclination
by
most
of
us
to
accept
the
labels
as
dispositive
of
facts
and
the
commission
labels
these
costs
out-of-pocket
cost
and
fully
distributed
cost.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
yes.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
it
would
have
been
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
--
if
the
old
rates
had
continued
and
the
traffic
which
--
the
study
indicated
would
have
moved,
had
there
been
no
change
in
the
rates.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
that's
right
and
for
$129
by
reason
of
the
new
rates,
justice
brennan;
the
railroad
had
to
transport
an
additional
four
million
pounds
of
traffic.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
no.
no,
i
didn't
mean
that.
if
they
had
gotten
the
four
million
pounds
under
the
old
rates,
they
would
have
made
--
they
would
have
made
much
greater
profit.
it
would
have
made
a
much
greater
profit.
the
point
was
and
what
the
study
disclosed
was,
that
there
was
a
certain
portion
of
all
of
the
traffic
that
moved
at
the
new
rates
which
theretofore
had
been
moving
by
the
--
by
the
railroads'
regular
boxcars
service
at
the
regular
rates
of
the
railroads.
and
if
this
traffic
had
moved
at
the
old
rates,
it
would
have
produced
revenues
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
yes,
it
says
--
well,
you
have
to
compute
it.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
that's
right.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
and
had
they
not
--
had
they
not
put
in
the
newer
rates,
they
would
have
had
substantially
the
same
amount
of
revenue
without
the
four
million
pounds.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
that's
right.
and
if
you
carried
less
freight
but
had
the
same
amount
of
revenue
substantially.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
other
forms
of
transportation.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
this
sounds
in
the
question
that
justice
white
had
asked
about
the
cost
because
there
is,
we
believe,
a
great
public
interest
in
the
maintenance
of
sound
economic
conditions
in
the
railroad
industry.
so,
the
railroads
can
continue
to
provide
service
and
the
motor
carriers
and
all
transportation
agencies.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
no,
they
didn't,
justice
clark.
that
was
gross
revenue.
that
was
gross
revenue
that
they
made
more.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
they
came
out
--
we
recomputed
it
in
our
brief
and
we
had
to
compute
it
from
the
--
the
evidence
that
was
submitted
and
it's
at
page
10
of
this
blue
brief.
that
at
the
normal
rates
in
transporting
only
the
traffic
that
would
have
moved
or
the
assumption
being
that
it
would
have
moved
at
the
normal
rates,
their
net
above
out-of-pocket
cost
would
have
been
in
the
vicinity
if
$76,000,
transporting
the
additional
four
million
pounds
of
traffic.
at
the
new
and
reduced
old
commodities
rates,
the
net
was
in
the
vicinity
of
$36,000,
a
loss
of
net
or
reduction
of
net
came
out
of
$40,000.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
no,
i
didn't
say
that
they
--
that
they
were
shipping
below
cost.
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that
and
that's
why
--
the
commission
found
that
they
did
not.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
that's
right.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
that's
right,
even
the
fully
distributed
basis,
and
that's
why
i
wanted
to
discuss
those
labels
because
i
--
i
think
an
understanding
of
them
by
the
court
is
essential
here.
it
must
be
recognized
that
in
the
operation
of
railroads,
you
have
a
great
jointness
of
cost,
the
road
that's
maintained
for
all
kinds
of
types
of
traffic
and
for
passenger
traffic,
and
freight,
and
everything
else.
well,
the
consequence,
the
commission
in
its
cost
findings
formulas
that
are
applied
started
off
by
dividing
this
total
cost
through
allocations.
they
allocated
to
passenger
service
and
so
much
to
the
freight
service.
in
the
freight
service,
they
allocate
out
of
that
so
much
for
the
less
than
carload
service
and
then
so
much
for
the
carload
service.
now,
we're
talking
about
carload
cost
here
when
the
commission
referred
to.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
that's
true,
that's
true.
again
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
there
are
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
justice
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
yes,
a
$129
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
well,
the
commission's
--
the
commission's
evidence
--
the
evidence
before
the
commission
was
that
it
did
and
the
commission
essentially
found
that.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
it's
implicit.
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
an
explicit
finding.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
i
don't
know.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
where
the
commission
makes
the
finding
that
four
million
pounds
of
traffic
additional
has
been
handled
for
only
$129
of
additional
revenues.
that's
sufficient.
i
think
it
carries
with
it
the
concept
that
this
is
where
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
because
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
well
because
justice
--
justice
brennan,
it
--
it
cost
the
railroads
to
handle
traffic.
their
costs
are
not
just
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
but
not
as
great.
oh,
no,
no.
no,
not
one
--
nowhere
near.
you
got
to
spot
the
cars
for
loading,
you
have
all
these
things
to
do,
nowhere
and
everything.
yes,
yes,
let
me
--
let
me
talk
about,
if
i
may,
about
this
fully
distributed
cost
because
i
think
that
justice
white
is
disturbed
here
and
you
too
justice
brennan.
i
stated
that
the
commission's
cost
formulas
do
these
allocations
so
that
you
have
your
total
railroad
or
portion
of
the
total
railroad
cost
that
are
allocated
to
carload
freight
rate.
now,
the
formula
then
says
that
you're
going
to
take
80%
of
that
total
and
then
treat
it
as
out-of-pocket.
the
remaining
20%
being
treated
as
constant
and
the
theory
is
that
it
will
be
incurred
whether
the
railroad
handles
more
or
less
traffic
anyhow,
that
20%
is
going
to
be
incurred.
so
that
put
to
one
side,
the
add
on
i
should
add
or
state
here
too
a
return
here
in
this
out-of-pocket
cost
of
4%
on
the
book
value
of
the
rolling
stock
and
2%
on
the
book
value
of
the
roadway.
they
then
utilize
various
formulae
to
allocate
that
80%
to
compute
out-of-pocket
cost
for
boxcar
traffic
of
one
sort
or
another
but
two
of
them
are
just
call
traffic.
all
the
rest,
these
are
all
allocations.
then
when
you
come
to
fully
distributed
cost,
you
must
add
back
the
20%
and
in
addition,
you
must
add
back
the
deficits
which
the
railroads
have
incurred
by
reason
of
their
passenger
service
and
the
less
than
carload
freight
service
which
also
incurs
the
deficit.
this
is
the
total
of
the
constant
cost
that
the
commission
has
to
distribute
to
compute
fully
distributed
cost.
now,
the
allocation
of
these
constant
costs
to
the
traffic
for
which
the
fully
booked
--
for
which
the
out-of-pocket
cost
have
been
computed
is
done
on
an
arbitrary
formula,
it
is
by
tons
and
ton
miles
and
produces
a
different
result
than
if
you
allocate
it
on
the
basis
of
the
ratio
that
the
out-of-pocket
cost
had
to
each
other.
and
you
come
out
ultimately
with
a
figure
saying
that
the
railroads
must,
from
all
of
their
freight
traffic,
and
this
is
the
important
part,from
all
of
their
freight
traffic,
they
have
got
to
recover
something
substantially
in
excess
of
out-of-pocket
cost.
now,
what
that
amounts
to
in
the
eastern
district
is
about
40%
of
the
out-of-pocket
cost.
in
this
case,
the
cost
all
related
to
the
so-called
eastern
district
and
not
to
the
new
haven
specifically.
i
believe
the
new
haven's
constant
cost
would
be
larger
because
it
incurs
a
larger
deficit
from
passenger
operations.
now
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
yes
and
that
--
substantially,
that's
correct.
the
--
and
of
course,
these
rates
run
to
the
mississippi
the
40%
that
from
all
of
the
carload
traffic
must
be
secured
from
obviously
the
traffic
that
can
bear
the
imposed.
now,
bituminous
coal
doesn't
supply
anything
like
that.
you
use
sand
and
gravel
or
--
and
we're
talking
all
carload
traffic.
the
result
is
that
your
boxcar
traffic
has
to
make
a
return
of
substantially
greater
than
this.
and
when
you
get
over
then
into
the
area
of
determining
how
much
a
given
type
of
traffic
should
return
in
that
excess
of
out-of-pocket
cost
in
order
to
permit
the
railroads
to
stay
financially
viable,
you
get
into
an
area
where
the
pencil
of
the
cost
expert
breaks.
because
obviously,
if
you
have
a
particular
traffic,
that
can't
be
transported
at
anything
like
40%
in
excess
of
out-of-pocket
cost.
it
might
be
better
for
the
railroad
to
transport
it
at
30%
in
excess.
and
here's
where
the
--
rather
than
to
forego
it
because
thereby
the
traffic
would
give
some
contribution
to
this
constant
cost,
this
payment.
well
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
we
do
not
raise
that
issue
here.
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
our
interest
is
that
our
rate
structures
not
be
destroyed
because
they
would
be
destroyed
if
the
railroad
rate
structure
is
destroyed.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
it
held
--
it
held
that
here,
the
railroad
had
the
right
to
do
this,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
violates
section
1(6)
of
the
act.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
and
does
not
constitute
instructive
competitive
rights.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
well,
we
don't
picture
our
case.
we
don't
say
that
it
is
by
reason
of
our
injury
that
these
rates
are
unlawful.
we
say
these
rates
are
unlawful
because
of
their
effect
on
the
rate
structures
of
railroads
themselves
that
they
do
not
conform
to
the
requirements
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.and
we
say
that
the
commission
so
found.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
it
may
sound
that
way,
mr.
chief
justice.
our
interest
is
--
our
interest
is
that
we
not
be
subjective
to
this
unlawful
competition.that
is
our
interest
but
that
is
not
the
issue
on
which
the
case
turns.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
the
commi
--
justice
goldberg,
the
commission
did
not
find.
we
were
not
injured.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
no.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
the
court
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
no,
the
court
said
that.
the
commission
did
not.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
no,
the
commission
made
no
finding.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
no,
we're
saying
it's
destructive
of
just
and
reasonable
rate
structures
and
we
are
injured
by
that.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
well,
we
compete,
justice
goldberg,
with
the
railroads.
but
the
railroads
do
not
have
a
just
and
reasonable
rates
structure,
neither
can
we.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
this
is
not
a
section
15.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
none.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
none.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
i
think
the
court
made
the
finding
there.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
i
don't
think
the
court
really
made
a
finding.
i
think
it
was
implicit
in
the
court's
finding.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
no
explicit
power.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
we're
trying
to
save
our
own
bacon,
commissioner
or
justice
stewart.
the
thing
we
say
is
this,
that
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
we
have
the
right
to
complain,
section
13,
and
the
act
gives
anybody
the
right
to
complain
about
anything
done
unlawful.
we
think
that
as
competitors
of
the
railroad,
we
have
the
right
to
demand
that
they
operate
lawful
and
maintain
a
lawful
rate
structure.
this
is
the
thing
that
we
are
urging
here
because
the
collateral
effect
of
their
failure
to
do,
precisely
that
will
kill
us.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
we
don't
make
a
section
15a(3)
case
on
here,
i
want
to
be
clear.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
we
are
--
we
are
but
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
we
--
we
are.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
i'm
sorry
if
i
gave
a
contrary
impression.
we
are
hurt.
the
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
we
are
not
pitching
our
case
upon
our
harm.
we
are
not
making
a
section
15a(3)
case
out
of
this
and
we
have
not.
now,
what
the
commission
said
is.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
well,
commissioner,
the
destructive
competitive
practice
is
in
the
national
transportation
policy.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
that's
where
the
reference
cost.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
it
does
not
necessarily
mean
intermodal
competition.
now,
the
court
below
drew
that
or
made
that
error
it
stated
in
its
opinion
that
this
law
is
a
section
15a(3)
case
and
said
that
the
commission
ought
never
will
made
any
such
finding,
with
respect
there's
--
they
said
that
it
wasn't
clear
to
them
as
to
why
the
commission
had
made
it.
they
then
ignored
entirely
this
study
to
which
i
referred.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
no,
we
are
hurt.
we
are
hurt.
there's
no
question
about
it.
and
the
commission
--
the
commission
made
this
finding
at
section
--
page
15
of
the
printed
record.
it
says
“while
such
rates”
and
they're
talking
about
all
commodity
rates,
“ignore
to
some
extent
the
individual
commodity
classifications,
they
are
necessary
in
established
part
of
the
national
rate
structure
and
thus,
may
appropriately
be
regarded
as
a
reasonable
separate
category
of
classification,
provided
always
that
such
rates
are
so
restricted
as
not
to
undermine
seriously
any
just
and
reasonable
rate
structure.
the
rates
here
under
investigation
apply
not
only
on
mixed
but
also
on
street
shipments
of
numerous
commodities
which
would
otherwise
be
subject
to
higher
rates.
thousands
of
commodities
are
included
in
this
sweeping
adjustment
without
relation
to
classification
principles
and
without
regard
to
the
destructive
effect
which
the
proposed
rates
would
have
upon
just
and
reasonable
rate
structures
necessary
to
the
maintenance
of
a
national
or
of
an
adequate
national
transportation
system.”
now
that,
of
course,
would
include
us.
if
not
restricted
to
reasonable
mixtures,
such
rates
could
and
no
doubt
would
break
down
these
rate
structures
to
the
detriment
of
carrier
or
carriers
and
shippers
alike.
the
evidence
is
clear
that
such
result
would
follow
approval
of
the
proposed
rates.
in
these
circumstances,
the
rates
must
be
condemned
as
constituting
a
destructive
competitive
practice
in
contravention
on
the
national
transportation
policy,
and
also,
as
in
violation
of
section
1(6).
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
well
again,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
we
don't
pitch
our
case
on
the
injury
to
us.
we
pitch
it
on
the
fact
that
these
rates
will
injure
us
collaterally
through
their
violation
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
we
put
our
primary
emphasis
upon
that
violation
that
we
have
an
interest
to
be
sure,
but
the
effect
upon
us,
is
a
collateral.
this
is
not
an
intermodal
competitive
case.
that's
--
we
have
the
right
to
complain
because
our
competitors
violate
the
act.
we
are
injured
by
that
violation.
that's
the
practical
reason
that
we
complain,
but
our
complaint
is
pitched
on
the
legal
ground
that
they
violated.
now,
i'd
like
to
come
back
if
i
may
to
this
matter
of
the
cost
because
the
division
2
of
the
commission
or
the
court
below
had
put
a
good
deal
of
reliance
upon
the
fact
that
these
--
even
these
reduced
rates
do
recover
full
cost
as
the
commission
computes
it.
but
i
want
to
emphasize
that
here,
the
court
below
invaded
the
sphere
of
the
commission
because
it
is
in
the
determination
of
just
how
much
a
given
traffic
should
provide
in
excess
of
out-of-pocket
costs
where
the
administrative
expertise
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
comes
into
play.
now
here,
we
think
there
was
an
invasion,
an
intrusion
by
the
court
into
the
administrative
field
and
we
insist
that
the
only
way
that
the
railroads
can
remain
viable
is
for
the
commission
to
exercise
the
administrative
obligation
which
it
has
to
fix
these
rates
in
relation
to
all
of
these
considerations.
that's
what
it
did
here.
here,
it
said
that
section
1(6)
of
the
act
requires
us
to
--
or
requires
the
railroads
to
have
all
of
its
--
all
of
their
rates
in
reasonable
relation
to
each
other,
and
where
the
railroads
fail
to
do
that,
the
very
purpose
of
this
differential
pricing
in
order
to
recover
the
total
cost
is
destroyed.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
the
railroads
argue
that
to
the
court
below,
justice
goldberg,
and
the
court
held
that
it
could.
the
--
i
don't
think
that
the
existence
of
those
others
destroys
the
meaning
of
section
1(6).
now,
the
railroads
had
urged
that
the
maintenance
by
them
of
a
tariff
is
known
as
the
uniform
freight
classifications
is
all
it's
necessary
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
section
1(6).
the
court
below
said
that
really
maintenance
of
these
classifications
which
are
nothing
but
categories
of
traffic
by
which
class
rates
are
made
applicable
was
for
the
purpose
of
fixing
maximum
reasonable
rates.
the
railroads
had
urged
that
in
the
court
below
and
the
court
so
found
but
the
railroads
now
say
that
now
it's
only
for
class
rates.
they
don't
have
any
argument
anymore
that
it's
with
respect
to
maximum
rates
only.
they
say
it's
only
with
respect
to
class
rates
and
that
they
are
--
they
are
useful
both
--
both
from
a
standpoint
of
regulation
of
maximum
as
well
as
minimum
rates.
but
when
they
say
that,
they
in
effect
read
section
1(6)
virtually
out
of
the
act
because
as
far
as
class
rates
are
concerned,
only
about
1%
of
the
traffic
now
moves.
and
we
take
the
position
and
we
say
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
ann
arbor
case
to
say
that
by
the
commission
itself
that
the
proper
interpretation
of
section
1(6)
is
that
the
commodity
rates
likewise
apply
the
categories
of
traffic
the
very
nature
of
the
fact.
there
are
special
ways
to
be
sure.
but
they
make
a
separate
category
of
traffic
for
--
in
particular
circumstance
and
this
is
true
of
all
commodity
rates
at
under
separate
or
under
special
circumstances,
particular
circumstances.
the
commission
has
approved
them
because
it
found
them
to
be
consistent
with
the
requirements
of
section
1(6).
they
were
just
and
reasonable
classification
of
traffic
for
that
particular
circumstance.
the
commission
said
that
wasn't
here.
it
wasn't
here
and
the
commission
is
using
a
statutory
tool
which
was
given
to
them.
i
want
to
say
one
other
thing.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
yes.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
yes,
the
issue
was
raised
before
the
commission
on
that
and
the
commission
held
that
this
was
a
just
and
reasonable
classification
with
respect
to
these
plan
iii
piggyback
rates,
justice
clark.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
the
commission
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
with
the
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
no,
it's
under
the
classification
of
a
piggyback.
there
is
the
restriction
as
i
mentioned
earlier
of
60%,
no
more
than
60%
of
the
total
lading
in
the
shipment
can
be
what
more
than
one
--
that
can
be
one
commodity.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
well,
the
commission
held
specifically
in
that
case,
justice
clark,
that
the
mixture
requirements
had
been
put
in
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
carload
rate
structure.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
and
that
it
was
adequate
for
that
purpose,
therefore,
there
was
no
violation
of
1(6),
they
say.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
perhaps,
i
don't
know.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
there
is
no
percentage.
these
rates
would
apply
to
a
straight
shipment
as
well
as
a
mixture.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
other
than
these
exceptions
that
we
spoke
of,
it
would
have
to
be
boxcar
traffic,
because
there
are
certain
very
limited
exception,
virtually
anything.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
you'd
have
two
trailers
that
could
be
--
there
has
to
be
more
than
one
commodity
and
that
commodity
no
one
of
two
commodities
could
be
more
than
60%
of
the
weight
of
the
aggregate.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
on
the
two
trailers,
yes.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
yes,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
in
some
instances
there's
been
some
contention
made
and
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
clear
on
it
that
there
could
be
just
one
commodity
if
it's
42,500
pounds
for
which
you
pay
but
which
you'd
paid
for
70,000
pounds.
if
i
make
myself
clear,
it's
a
technical
feature
of
this.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
minimum
of
two.
the
minimum
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
yes
that's
right.
there
must
be
a
minimum
of
two.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
there
can
be
no
more
than
two.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
oh,
any
number.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
yes.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
but
at
least
two.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
are
we
clear?
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
so
that
--
so
if
you
had
a
70,000
pound
shipment
of
two
commodities
with
the
60%
provision
and
you'd
have
42,000
pounds
would
be
the
most
that
one
of
them
could
weigh.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
true.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
these
rates
have
no
such
restriction
at
all.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
single
item.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
yes
sir,
absolutely.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
that's
what
would
mean,
justice
brennan
that
all
of
the
rates
that
have
been
fixed
the
boxcar
transportation
of
commodities
in
single
carload
movements
or
single
commodity
carloads
would
be
defeated
by
these
if
they
were
above
these
rates
and
these
rates
are
on
extremely
low
level.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
absolutely
right.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
that's
right.
of
course,
the
evidence
before
the
commission
was
that
the
railroad
having
to
put
these
and
we're
thinking
about
putting
them,
making
them
applicable
to
other
destinations.
but
the
case
was
tried
on
this
too.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
i
don't
know,
justice
white.
that's
why
we
have
an
interstate
commerce
commission
to
prevent
them
from
doing
it?that's
why
the
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
yes
and
sometimes
the
corporate
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
well,
the
new
haven
railroad
in
receiver
ship,
it's
unknown.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
sir.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
well,
the
--
sometimes
it's
desperate
and
maybe
what
the
situation
wants
here,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
since
--
since
the
year
one,
railroads
have
put
in
rate
policies
that
the
commission
has
--
had
to
condemn
because
they
thought
it
was
bad
for
the
nation
as
a
whole
and
sometimes
for
the
railroad
itself.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
this
still
lies
in
the
future.
we
litigated
that
case.
we
opposed
those
piggyback
rates,
commission
found
we
are
wrong,
we
appealed
it
to
the
--
asked
the
order
be
set
aside
in
kansas
city
in
the
federal
court
there
and
the
court
sustained
the
commission
and
this
court
has
already
affirmed.
we
think
there
are
some
serious
flaws
on
those
rates
but
i
think
the
matter
will
have
to
await
the
experience
in
the
transportation
industry
to
determine
whether
they're
good
or
not,
justice
clark.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
oh
yes.
we
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
oh
--
the
--
the
--
there's
evidence
before
the
commission.
the
commission's
finding
did
not
include
it.
there
was
the
evidence
before
the
commission
that
it
would
hurt
us,
oh
yes.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
they
did
not
base
it.
they
based
it
upon
the
proposition
that
it
would
destroy
all
rate
structure,
all
classification.
and
that
this
was
bad
for
the
transportation
industry
as
a
whole,
not
only
--
not
only
the
railroads
but
also
us.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
no
question
about
that.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
justice
clark,
there
were
some
findings
or
there
was
some
evidence
on
that.
there
were
some
findings
by
division
2.
that
division
2
found
that
the
diversion
had
been
30,000
pounds
or
for
every
30,000
pounds
of
traffic
that
was
attracted
to
this
traffic,
there
was
a
100,000
pounds
that
had
come
from
real
service
itself,
do
i
make
myself
clear?
in
other
words,
that
the
ratio
of
the
traffic
that
had
been
attracted
was
30,000
of
it
from
the
railroad
or
from
the
motor
carriers
and
a
100,000
from
other
railroad
service.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
and
this
was
by
reasonable
deduction.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
the
100
--
yes
that's
right.
no
new
traffic
generated,
if
that's
what
you
mean.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
this
was
all
diverted.
i
wanted
to
say
one
other
thing,
the
government
has
filed
a
brief
in
this
case
in
which
it
takes
issue
with
the
court
on
the
value
of
service
concept
at
which
the
court
injected
into
this
case
there
was
no
value
of
service
mentioned
by
the
commission
in
its
decision
or
no
reliance
for
the
commission
on
that
concept
to
break
regulation.
we
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
justice
stewart,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
but
classification
considerations
include
many,
many
things
besides
the
value
of
service,
many
things.
and
the
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
yes.
yes,
many.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
that's
right.
the
commission
asked
the
case
be
set
back
to
it
so
they
can
have
a
further
hearing
on
this
value
of
service
concept.
we
don't
think
that
that
ought
to
be
done.
this
case
is
almost
six
years
old
and
we
think
there
should
be
a
termination
of
it
here.
the
issue
of
value
of
service
is
not
per
se
in
this
case,
and
if
the
--
if
the
commission
wants
to
make
some
determination
as
to
the
modern
day
meaning
of
it,
we
think,
it
ought
await
a
case
where
it
is
specifically
an
issue.
we
think
that
the
decision
by
the
commission,
the
holding
in
the
court
with
the
law
supported
adequately
by
the
commission's
findings
and
we
asked
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
and
remand
the
case
with
instructions
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
the
commission
in
its
brief
to
this
court
stated
that
it
entertained
doubts
as
to
the
adequacy
of
its
finding
on
destructive
competitive
price.
we
say
that
there's
no
necessity
to
make
a
precise
literary
finding
on
that
score.
that
you
read
the
commission's
report
as
a
whole
and
that's
what
this
court
said
in
the
alabama
great
southern
case.
i
have
a
citation
for
that
here,
alabama
great
southern
railway
company
v.
united
states
340
u.s.,
216.
if
you
do
read
this
report
by
the
entire
commission
as
a
whole
you
can't
help
but
come
to
the
conclusion
that
its
ultimate
finding
is
based
upon
its
discussion
of
the
evidence
where
it
made
this
finding
that
the
railroad
would
be
required
to
handle
a
lot
of
traffic
for
virtually
no
revenue.
a
lot
of
additional
traffic
for
virtually
no
revenue,
and
that
this
was
made.
we
think
also
that
there
is
another
decision
by
this
court
that's
relevant
here.
you
held
that
where
the
commission
has
plainly
considered
the
evidence
before
it
has
reached
an
obvious
conclusion
from
that
evidence
that
that's
adequate
but
you
don't
need
to
tell
the
specific
finding
setting
forth
each
step
in
the
chain
of
a
logical
reason
that
was
minneapolis
and
st.
louis
railroad
v.
united
states
361
u.s.
173.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
no,
no,
no.
i
said
it
must
have
--
i
wouldn't
go
that
far
justice
goldberg.
i
don't
believe
i
did
before.
if
it
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
yes
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
no.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
well,
here
--
here
is
my
philosophy
on
that
that
where
it
does
or
where
it
fails
to
benefit,
the
approval
but
does
injure
its
competitors,
it
is
by
definition
of
a
destructive
competitive
price.
because
that's
obviously
the
only
effect
is
to
destroy
or
to
injure
a
competitor.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
sometimes.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
this
might
be.
absolutely
you're
right,
justice
goldberg.
and
here,
the
commission
made
a
finding
on
that
too.
it
said
that
it
would
be
detrimental
to
carriers
and
shippers
alike
for
this
rate
structure
to
be
destroyed
as
these
rates
will
do,
and
that's
the
basis
of
the
commission's
decision.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
the
rate
structure,
it
said
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
that's
right.
that's
the
basis
of
the
destructive
competitive
right.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
that
is
one
of
the
considerations
which
is
certainly
part.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
reflected
in
one.
that
is
the
maintenance
of
different
levels
of
rates
on
different
commodities.
certainly,
value
of
service
is
one
of
the
things
that's
considered.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
the
court
below
and
that
would
be
the
question
--
that's
what
it
says.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
the
government's
brief
--
the
government's
brief
touches
on
that
too,
yes.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
that's
right,
justice
goldberg.
the
situation
is
that
that
the
stake
of
the
shipper
is
in
the
maintenance
of
an
adequate
transportation
system.
the
--
and
that
the
shipper
is
general.
the
commission
said
that
there
can't
be
this
adequate
transportation
system
if
you
destroy
the
rate
structure.
these
rates
will
destroy
the
rate
structure
and
the
evidence
proves
it.
that's
the
case
on
a
thumbnail.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wanted
to
address
myself
first
to
a
comment
by
mr.
justice
white
with
respect
to
the
possibility
that
these
rates
have
prevented
an
erosion
of
traffic.
i
think
it
is
dangerous
to
speculate
as
to
what
could
have
happened
in
the
absence
of
these
rates.
the
fact
is
that
either
way
--
i
think
that's
correct.
the
fact
is
that
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
no.
if
the
--
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
no,
mr.
justice
white.
the
commission
made
the
decision
on
it.
now,
these
figures,
these
data
from
which
the
commission
drew
its
conclusion
were
put
in
by
the
new
haven
railroad
and
the
witness
of
the
new
haven
testified
specific
in
this
record,
that
these
disclosed
the
particular
traffic
which
were
--
which
was
being
affected
by
these
rates.so
that,
this
is
an
area
within
which
the
commission
has
special
cover.
i
think
that
the
commission's
finding
on
that
is
dispositive
of
it.
mr.
homer
s.
carpenter
well,
i
--
if
your
honor
please
it
seems
to
me
that
somebody
is
going
to
have
to
make
these
determinations.
and
when
the
commission
does
it,
if
there's
a
rational
basis
for
it,
i
think
the
judicial
inquiry
ends
right
there.
that's
the
position
i
take
it.
and
i
think
it
is
supported
by
a
good
many
and
of
the
opinions
of
this
court.
there
is
one
area
in
which
we
agree
with
the
railroad
appellees
here.
we
think
this
case
is
right
for
decision.
we
think
that
the
value
of
service
concept
was
injected
into
the
case
by
the
court
below,
and
we
know
it
was
not
relied
upon
by
the
commission
in
its
decision.
we
repeat
that
we
deal
with
it
and
--
or
that
the
commission
should
deal
with
it
if
it
wants
to
in
the
future,
in
a
case
where
it
is
the
central
issue
in
the
case
not
in
this
where
it
is
at
best
a
peripheral
matter.
there
are
two
bases
for
the
commission's
decision,
the
destruct
--
destructive
competitive
practice
to
which
i've
already
referred.
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
in
that
respect,
the
court
below
stated
that
the
commission
had
brought
that
issue
in
under
section
15a(3)
and
the
court
was
plainly
wrong
because
the
only
way
it
gets
in
to
section
15a(3)
is
by
reference
to
the
national
transportation
policy
and
the
national
transportation
policy
came
into
the
act
18
years
before
15a(3)
was
added
to
the
act.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
national
transportation
policy
had
a
predecessor
in
the
motor
carrier
act
in
1935,
this
destructive
competitive
practice
provision
and
applied
them
just
to
the
motor
carriers.
it
wasn't
until
1940
that
it
was
made
applicable
to
the
--
to
the
entire
act
and
by
its
own
terms
permeates
the
entire
act.
and
as
this
court
has
said
in
the
schaffer
case
is
the
yardstick
by
which
you
measure
the
correctness
of
the
commission's
decision.
now,
with
respect
to
section
1(6),
i
would
like
to
point
out
again
in
response
to
a
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
white,
the
rates
here,
these
all
commodity
rates
which
are
in
essence
any
commodity
rates
in
as
much
as
they
don't
apply
on
any,
or
if
they
don't
require
a
mixture
are
measured
by
the
commission
itself
by
reference
to
the
class
rates,
the
highest
one
that
is
assessed
is
45%
of
first
class
and
the
lowest
19%
of
first
class.
i
unfortunately
didn't
address
very
many
on
my
earlier
remarks
to
section
1(6).
i
would
like
at
this
time
to
adopt
the
argument
of
the
government
at
pages
9
to
18
of
its
brief.
it's
a
very
lawyer-like
presentation.
and
i'd
like
to
read
very
briefly
from
that
because
there
was
an
early
case
in
which
the
commission
did
apply
this
principle
of
classification
as
used
in
1(6)
to
commodity
rates.
and
it
is
in
the
rates
on
lumber
and
lumber
products
52
i.c.c.
598
at
page
15
of
the
government
brief,
where
the
--
where
the
commission
said,
a
classification
of
given
articles
is
effected
by
a
determination
of
the
rate
relationship.
in
a
measure,
this
is
true
when
articles
are
grouped
together
under
a
commodity
description
in
a
commodity
tariff,
as
well
as
when
they
are
included
in
official
western
or
southern
classification.
thank
you
very
much.
