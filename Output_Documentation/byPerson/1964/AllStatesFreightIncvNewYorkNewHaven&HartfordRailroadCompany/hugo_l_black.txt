justice

why
wouldn't
the
proper
order
here
that
hardly
the
court
should
take
as
viewpoint
at
all
be
merely
to
vacate
the
judgment
without
reversing
and
without
passing
on
the
legal
question,
send
it
back
to
the
commission
in
view
of
its
request
to
be
allowed
to
make
further
findings?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
vacation
would
leave
it
fully
undecided.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
leave
--
that
would
vacate
the
judgment
below
and
--
but
we'll
give
you
a
chance
but
be
on
our
understanding
if
you
know
what
we
mean.
in
reality,
this
case
ought
not
to
be
passed
on
as
a
whole
until
the
commission
makes
further
findings.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
can't
see
whether
there'd
be
any
injury
that's
why
i
m
asking.
after
vacation,
more
or
less
of
a
kind
of
a
moot
thing
if
you
--
with
the
legal
decision
if
you
tell
us
that
there
is
--
really
not
enough
finding
there.
it
needs
to
be
directed
--
it
needs
to
be
improved.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
--
maybe
the
government
was
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
the
courts
do
to
vacate
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
my
trouble
is
something
like,
there
are
--
you
want
us
to
correct
the
opinion
and
then
send
it
back
on
the
basis
that
it's
not
ready
for
final
decision.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
status
of
the
rates
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
the
railroad
would
not
be
injured
so
far
the
rates
are
concerned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
a
vacation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
other
point
is
i
think
so
--
and
what
is
wrong,
it
was
trying
to
wait
until
the
case
can't
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
all
the
facts
and
all
the
claims
that
are
made.
so
long
as
you
are
not
being
injured
by
your
rates.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
would
--
undoubtedly,
you
wouldn't
but
they
seem
to
think
they
can
make
that
case
stronger.
i
can
understand
your
objection
to
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
we
are
asked
after
we
decide
that
to
send
it
back
to
the
commission
for
more
finding
and
so
forth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
you
wouldn't
ask
it
but
i
understand
they're
asking
that
we
leave
it
open
so
they
can
go
ahead
with
the
same
proceeding.
at
least
it
could
follow
up
the
idea
they
have
and
that
more
fact
might
make
the
situation
better
for
their
side.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
a
mere
legal
question,
that's
what
bothers
me,
if
it's
a
mere
legal
statement
of
a
broad
principle
knowing
that
the
situation
is
not
yet
ready
for
a
final
decision
on
the
merits
of
this
case.
that
would
be
a
rather
extraordinary
thing
to
do,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
the
trucking
association
and
still
they
could
drive.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
want
to
protect
your
client's
interest.
