mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
another
lack
of
validity
in
the
suggestion
by
appellants
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
included
any
findings
of
fact
in
their
final
report
on
reconsideration
underlying
the
finding
of
destructive
competitive
practice.
now,
they
point
to
the
statement
in
the
report
which
is
on
page
12
of
the
record,
â€œto
the
affect
that
during
76
days
prior
to
the
hearing
before
the
icc
that
our
section
2,
all
commodity
rates
produce
four
million
pounds
of
additional
traffic
in
return
for
a
$129.00
of
that
in
revenue."
the
record
as
a
whole
shows
that
the
statement
is
without
any
meaning
whatever
to
the
final
decision
of
the
commission.
now
i
think
or
for
furthermore,
there
are
--
in
fact
there
are
no
findings
whatever
in
their
report
to
support
its
finding
of
destructive
competitive
practice.
now,
i
think
a
brief
examination,
and
i'll
attempt
to
make
it
as
brief
as
possible,
of
the
record
will
show
this.
it
shows
first
that
the
new
haven
had
in
mind
in
publishing
in
section
2,
all
commodity
rates
two
things
and
i
think
that
mr.
kaier
covered
this.
i
would
like
to
cover
it
very
briefly.
first,
to
fill
up
about
150
boxcars
which
were
moving
each
day
empty
westbound.
secondly,
it
hoped
to
prevent
the
erosion
of
its
boxcar
traffic
to
motor
carriers
on
one
hand
and
to
the
plane
iii
carriers
on
the
other.
now,
certainly
the
plan
iii
piggyback
and
i
think
this
is
well
established
--
was
established
to
comeback
motor
carrier
competition
both
regulated
and
unregulated.
therefore
when
we
are
attempting
in
our
boxcar
rates
to
meet
plan
iii
this
doesn't
mean
that
we're
meeting
other
rail
competition.
it
means
we
are
trying
to
adjust
our
boxcar
rates
to
accommodate
motor
carrier
competition
already
being
met
by
plan
iii
piggyback.
now,
it
should
be
noted
in
the
record
--
i
will
--
should
have
noted
that
the
record
shows
that
after
76
days
of
operation,
the
new
haven's
new
rate
schedule
had
attracted
only
about
three
cars
per
day
average
of
new
traffic
and
that
be
attracted
from
the
trucks
only
about
one
car
a
day
to
fill
up
the
150
which
we
had
available.
now,
this
performance,
it
has
to
be
admitted,
shows
something
less
than
an
overwhelming
success
as
a
result
of
our
rates.
and
perhaps
this
may
show
that
the
rates
aren't
low
enough.
it
certainly
doesn't
support
a
finding
of
destructive
competitive
practice.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
to
that
i
think
it
does
show.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
that's
the
matter
i
want
to
cover,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
that's
correct.
this
is
the
matter
that
i
would
like
to
cover.
and
certainly
it
doesn't
show
that
we
--
that
we
gained
more
traffic.
it
shows
that
we
at
least
handle
a
certain
amount
of
traffic
under
the
section
2
rates.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
which
we
may
not
have
handled
it,
we
have
had
to
use
the
prior
--
the
previously
effective
rates.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
i
would
go
this
far,
your
honor.
i
think
the
fact
that
it
attracted
some
boxcar
traffic
and
some
truck
traffic
it
would
at
least
indicate
they
were
effective.
to
what
extent
they
were
effective,
we
don't
know
and
the
record
doesn't
show
and
i
don't
think
anybody
can
get
into
the
realm
of
speculation
and
ratemaking
to
the
extent
of
saying
the
rates
at
a
certain
level
attracted
to
certain
number
of
boxcars.
and
that
these
will
come
from
such
and
such
source
and
we'll
make
such
and
such
revenue.
it's
--
it's
impossible
to
do.
and
of
course,
this
is
one
of
the
problems
which
the
commission
has
in
front
of
it,
when
it's
considering
new
rates
as
these
are.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
the
record
closed
that
three
a
day
and
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that's
more
than
that.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
the
rates
are
still
in
effect,
your
honor.
so
far
as
i
know
they
still
move
traffic.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
new
haven
does
have
piggyback,
your
honor.
we
--
the
record
shows
that
we
had
some
disadvantages
at
the
time
the
record
was
close.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
they
have
not
been
entirely
correct.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
i'm
sorry
i
couldn't
hear
you,
sir.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
we
have
some
large
flatcars,
that's
why
this
is
a
question
of
supply.
there
may
be
shortages
of
long
flatcars
to
handle
all
the
available
traffic.
i
think
that
may
be
one
of
our
problems
because
of
finance.
we
have
a
large
number
of
40-foot
flatcars
which
are
the
old
type
and
which
trailers
are
still
loaded
on,
even
though
there
are
two
trailers
for
shipment.
they
use
one
trailer
to
a
flat
car
in
many
instances.
now,
in
1958
and
this
goes
to
the
construction
of
the
rates,
what
the
rates
actually
did,
how
we
approach
this
problem
of
attempting
to
fill
the
150
empty
boxcars
and
prevent
erosion
to
the
highway.
in
1958,
practically
all
eastern
carriers
and
i
think
this
has
been
covered
before,
i'll
keep
it
brief.
practically,
all
eastern
carriers
faced
a
serious
erosion
of
traffic
to
highway
carriers
both
regulated
and
unregulated.
and
that
during
that
same
year
the
transportation
act
of
1958
was
passed
and
as
a
result
of
that
legislation,
the
eastern
blinds
were
encouraged
to
expand
on
a
--
an
old
form
of
trailer-
on-flatcar
service,
and
this
was
known
as
plan
iii
which
mr.
carpenter
has
already
explained.
i
think
that
just
in
brief,
i
will
explain
that
the
piggyback
rates
apply
on
two
trailers,
moving
in
the
same
shipment
not
necessarily
on
the
same
flatcar
within
the
same
shipment.
a
maximum
loading
is
permitted
of
70,000
pounds.
the
rates
are
the
same
for
the
shipment
regardless
of
the
character
of
traffic
in
the
boxcar
or
in
the
trailers,
or
regardless
of
the
weight
less
than
70,000
pounds.
it's
irrelevant
to
this
discussion
that
there
is
an
excess
charge
for
over
seven.
at
any
rate
this
is
the
type
of
rate
which
has
been
in
existence
for
sometime,
it
was
an
existence
at
the
time
that
we
were
establishing
our
section
2,
all
commodity
rates.
and
these
had
to
be
a
consideration
in
establishing
our
rates
and
in
determining
a
level
at
which
those
rates
would
be
established
our
section
2
or
commodity
rates
and
these
had
to
be
a
consideration
in
establishing
our
rates
and
in
determining
the
level
at
which
those
rates
would
be
established.
and
incidentally
i'm
not
sure
if
this
was
set.
the
plan
iii
service
and
charges
had
been
approved
by
the
commission
and
eastern
central
motor
carriers
v.
baltimore
and
ohio,
reported
314
i.c.c.
5,
1961.
and
the
decision
of
the
three-judge
court
upholding
the
commission
in
226
fd.
supp.
318
was
affirmed
by
this
court
in
cooper-jarrett
v.
united
states,
number
159
of
this
term.
so
in
1959,
when
the
section
2
rates
were
being
formulated,
it
was
clear
that
in
a
new
pricing
approach,
had
to
be
resolved
with
a
key
in
hand
of
those
rates
with
the
existing
section
3
or
plan
iii
piggyback
rates.
now,
along
this
line,
there
have
been
--
and
i
think
this
was
mentioned
i
don't
know
to
what
extent.
there
were
in
existence
in
the
time
our
section
2
rates
were
established,
also
section
1
rates
and
these
likewise
were
on
all
commodity
freight.
they
were
--
one
rate
however
from
boston
to
chicago
the
level
of
the
rate
was
i
believe
$2.13
cents
per
100
pounds.
for
a
shipment,
a
minimum
weight
of
shipment
of
30,000
pounds.
however,
because
of
a
various
fringe
benefits
in
connection
with
those
rates,
the
average
car
loading
was
about
20,000
pounds
per
car
on
a
shipment
of
section
1
of
all
commodity
rates.
now,
the
rates
which
we
have
here
are
here
in
issue
are
constructed
on
the
one
end.
you
will
notice
they
are
made
of
a
scale.
there's
a
rate
(inaudible)
to
lowering
the
scale
add
more
to
a
shipping
weight
of
20,000
pounds.
that
rate
is
the
same
as
the
section
1
or
substantially
the
same
as
a
section
1
all
commodity
rate,
which
has
been
in
existence
for
years.
now,
it
went
down
to
the
other
end
of
this
scale
where
70,000-pound
rates,
and
that
is
the
same
as
the
plan
iii
rates
on
a
70,000-pounds
shipment.
but
it's
higher
to
the
extent
that
a
shipper
would
pay
in
addition
to
the
plan
iii
rate,
a
pickup
and
delivery
charge
or
cost
that
either
end
of
the
terminal
--
at
either
terminal
both
in
origin
and
destination.
now,
in
the
center
of
the
--
of
the
scale
of
rates,
we
have
of
course
some
10,000
pounds
increments
rates
on
20,000,
30,000,
40,000,
50,000,
60,000
and
70,000
pounds.
in
the
center
of
the
30,000-pound
rates
on
this
scale
which
is
here
involved,
were
made
somewhat
higher,
slightly
higher,
and
this
is
shown
in
exhibit
22
page
176
of
the
record.
they're
slightly
higher
than
the
motor
carrier
30,000-pound
rates
on
most
commodities
which
are
shown
in
that
exhibit.
our
40,000-pound
rates,
this
is
of
course
would
create
an
incentive,
were
slightly
lower
than
the
range
of
30,000-pound
motor
carrier
rates
shown
in
that
exhibit.
now,
this
is
not
entirely
a
consistent
pattern
but
it
is
consistent
as
with
possible
in
establishing
a
single
level
of
rates
based
on
shipping
weights.
now
i
like
to
mention
this
that
the
charge
for
a
50,000-pound
shipment
from
boston
to
chicago
in
plan
iii
would
be
$494.50
cents
as
compared
with
a
charge
for
a
similar
shipment
in
boxcars
under
section
2
of
$530.
so,
these
are
related.
you
have
then
the
section
2
rates
tied
in
with
--
with
your
plan
iii
piggyback.
now,
it's
entirely
clear,
i
think,
that
because
we
had
published
our
plan
iii
rates
at
levels
which
were
hidden
with
--
which
were
competitive
with
motor
carriers,
and
particularly
with
unregulated
private
truckers,
we
could
expect
our
closely
related
boxcar
rates
to
capture
some
truck
traffic
and
in
effect,
in
fact
this
did
happen
as
the
record
shows.
now,
although
not
--
though
it
was
not
conclusive,
we
also
presented
the
commission
some
figures,
the
only
ones
available,
to
show
a
trend
under
the
new
schedules,
and
those
are
the
ones
shown
on
page
12
of
the
record
which
were
in
the
commission's
final
report.
now,
all
the
exhibit
shows
on
its
face
and
these
may
be
partly
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white's
question.
in
my
mind
is
that
the
new
schedules
are
effective
in
attracting
some
truck
traffic.
to
what
extent
they
have
retained
traffic,
we
can't
say.
we
think
they
were
somewhat
successful
in
that
regard
at
least
they
carried
some
traffic.
in
order
to
provide
and
i'd
like
to
--
to
quickly
go
through
this.
in
order
to
provide
the
commission
with
a
comparison
of
earnings,
the
new
haven's
witness
prepared
exhibit
28,
that's
at
page
200
of
the
record
which
shows
the
times
that
tonnages
and
earning
under
the
new
rates
and
then
re-rated
them
the
same
tonnages
using
the
old
rates.
now,
they
used
two
assumptions,
first,
that
the
volume
would
be
the
same
and
this
is
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white's
question.
they
assumed
that
the
volume
of
traffic
would
be
the
same
as
under
the
old
rates.
and
they
also
assumed
that
the
same
number
of
boxcars
would
be
required
to
handle
that
traffic
as
under
the
new
rates,
even
though
--
even
though
under
the
new
rates
the
average
loading
was
quite
high.
now
it's
made
of
--
it's
quite
clear
in
the
record
that
the
comparison
couldn't
be
taken
as
an
accurate
measure
of
improved
revenues,
and
certainly
i
--
i
think
that
in
our
discussion
this
is
clear.
and
certainly,
it
couldn't
be
taken
as
a
measure
of
net
revenues
because
the
service
performed
under
the
old
rates
was
quite
a
bit
different
and
more
extensive
than
under
the
new.
and
again,
we
didn't
know
how
much
traffic
we'd
move
would
be
retained
under
the
--
under
the
old
rates
if
they
had
been
on
effect
rather
than
the
rates.
now,
as
to
the
possible
increase
in
that
revenues,
the
cost
of
handling
a
traffic
at
the
old
section
1
rates,
were
greater
because
the
number
of
boxcars
needed
were
--
were
--
a
greater
number
of
boxcars
were
needed
to
handle
the
same
amount
of
traffic.
the
commission
statement
in
the
report,
therefore,
at
page
12,
as
to
the
four
million
pounds
for
additional
$129
is
wholly
without
meaning,
and
nevertheless
the
--
appellants
rely
on
this
to
show
destructive
competitive
practice.
now,
if
the
commission
had
intended
to
support
its
finding,
it
would
had
to
reconcile
several
other
things
and
quickly
they
would
had
--
they
would
have
had
to
justify
its
approving
the
plan
iii
piggyback
rates,
which
would
have
produced
and
this
is
shown
in
our
record
at
page
201.
it
would
produced
if
the
same
traffic
which
moved
into
76
days
had
then
--
had
moved
in
plan
iii
piggyback,
it
would
have
accrued
$1200
less
revenues.
now,
this
isn't
disturbing
to
us
because
the
cost
of
piggyback
is
different,
and
the
service
is
different.
now
next,
the
commission
must
have
seen
in
the
record
that
an
average
of
only
three
cars
per
day
were
moving
under
the
section
2
rates,
the
same
time
34
cars
per
day
were
moving
under
the
old
section
1
rates
just
between
boston
and
chicago,
and
this
is
shown
in
the
printed
record
199.
so
this
clearly
shows
a
lack
of
validity
in
the
commission's
fear
that
section
1
rates
or
section
2
rates
would
destroy
the
rate
structure
and
that
traffic
moving
under
section
2
would
constitute
the
bulk
of
the
freight
moving
out
of
the
lines
of
the
new
haven
and
to
the
points
involved
in
the
tariffs.
now,
one
final
thing,
the
question
of
net
revenue
under
the
new
rates
was
raised,
the
assumption
that
the
traffic
would
have
moved
in
one
boxcar
and
under
the
old
rates
for
every
boxcar
under
the
new
rates
is
shown
to
be
erroneous
in
the
record
that
--
well
i
can't
put
my
finger
on
the
record
reference,
but
there
is
a
--
a
reference
in
the
record
showing
that
the
average
rate
or
the
average
number
of
cars
under
the
old
rate
of
section
1
was
two
per
shipment
and
the
average
was
about
20,000
pounds
per
shipment.
now,
if
we
then
recalculate
the
cost
of
moving
the
two
boxcars
under
the
old
rates
for
every
boxcar
under
the
new
rates,
we
will
find
that
the
new
haven
actually
has
save
itself
from
$18,000
out-of-pocket
loss,
whereas
that
the
--
the
record
shows
that
it
actually
did
gain
$36,000
above
out-of-pocket
costs.
now,
i
think
that
in
conclusion
i
--
i
had
said
enough
to
indicate
that
the
record
is
completely
clear
to
show
that
the
new
haven
and
its
connections
achieve
the
rates
that
are
here
involved
into
the
existing
rate
structure.
i
think
there
is
no
question
that
a
whole
lot
of
traffic
is
not
moving
under
these
rates,
we
can't
blame
that.
however,
i
think
that
indicates
that
it
is
a
pragmatic
test.
i
think
that
indicates
that
the
rates
are
not
destructively
--
a
destructive
competitive
practice.
in
a
sense
we
wish
that
there
was
more
indication
that
this
solved
but
we
simply
aren't
moving
enough
traffic
for
the
commission
to
have
found
that
the
rates
constituted
destructive
competitive
practice.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
yes
sir,
that
does.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
we
have
but
well
--
you
said
why
it
isn't
the
class
rate,
your
honor?
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
well,
it
isn't
a
class
rate
because
it
doesn't
relate
to
the
uniform
freight
classification
which
mr.
kaier's
away
referred
to.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
that's
a
missing
--
that's
a
compelling
reasonable
maximum
rates.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
get
the
last.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
that's
correct
and
the
class
rate
itself
is
prescribed
as
well.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
well,
the
commission
tells
us,
your
honor,
what
class
rates
are
and
they
tell
us
what
the
maximum
--
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
because
this
is
not
prescribed
by
the
commission
obviously.
they
condemned
it
rather
than
prescribe
it.
but
the
class
rate
is
the
maximum
rate
which
are
--
well
which
can
be
charged
for
a
traffic.
the
class
rate
and
the
classification
of
course
as
mr.
kaier
said
go
together,
and
together
these
form
the
maximum
rate
which
can
be
charged
for
any
class
of
traffic.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
question,
your
honor.
in
other
words
on
the
same
--
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
well,
i
don't
think
they're
entirely
saying
that,
your
honor.
i
think
what
their
saying
is
you
can
have
all
commodity
rates
so
long
as
they're
higher
than
existing
commodity
rates
on
individual
commodities
that
have
moved
under
the
all
commodity
rates.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
so
in
that
sense
they
are
saying
you
can
have
them
but
they
really
won't
be
much
good
to
you
except
--
unless
you
want
to
move
them
next
to
you
traffic.
and
that
isn't
what
they
new
haven
wanted
to
do.
the
new
haven
wanted
to
move
a
great
number
of
types
of
traffic
of
manufactured
articles
under
these
rates,
and
it
didn't
wanted
have
to
go
through
the
problem
of
publishing
an
individual
rate
on
each
manufactured
article.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
well,
because
if
it
had
gone
through
an
entirely
new
class
rate
system
on
publication
of
new
class
rates,
then
if
they
were
called
class
rates
and
the
commission
finally
accepted
them
as
such,
then
these
would
be
the
maximum
then
at
which
the
traffic
involved
would
move
in
transportation
service.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
class
rates
are
a
little
bit
too
inflexible
to
do
the
kind
of
job
we
had
to
do
between
these
points,
new
england
points
and
chicago
or
st.
louis.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
they
still
have
them
in
effect.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
all
of
the
lines
involved
are
participating
in
this
section
2
rates
to
my
--
the
best
of
my
knowledge
do
have
piggyback
service,
that's
correct.
but
piggyback
service
doesn't
correct
the
empty
boxcar
problem
which
the
new
haven
had.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
yes.
my
comparison
would
have
to
do
simply
--
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
that's
correct.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
well,
we
would
have
continued
experience
with
the
rates.
i'm
not
sure
if
it
would
show
anything
different
than
it
did
in
76
days
prior
to
hearing
justice
white.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
well,
we
--
i
--
i
think
that
it's
correct
to
say
that
piggyback
and
i
think
that
it's
common
knowledge
that
it's
becoming
stronger
and
stronger
as
time
goes
along.
this
is
the
best
evidence
that
i
know
that
these
price
that
we're
talking
about
does
not
destructively
create
destructive
competition.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
commission
has
approved
piggyback
rates,
plan
iii
rates
--
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
and
i
think
they
are
the
important
rates
today.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
well,
we
hope
that
we
achieve
these
rates
and
at
least
to
make
maximum
use
of
our
boxcars,
so
that
the
boxcar
rates
will
then
be
compatible
with
our
piggyback
rates.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
i
think
as
a
general
rule,
i
think
that's
growing
more
and
more
so,
your
honor.
mr.
kaier
reminds
me
that
1(6)
has
already
been
decided
in
connection
with
piggyback
by
the
commission
in
which
they
found
that
there
was
no
violation
of
the
classification
section
of
the
act.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
that
was
in
the
eastern
central
motor
carriers
association
v.
baltimore
&
ohio
railroad
company.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
that
was
on
plan
iii
piggyback.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
and
that
has
a
mixture
but
the
trailers
--
there
are
two
trailers
in
a
shipment.
each
trailer
can
contain
a
solid
shipment
of
one
type
of
freight.
mr.
eugene
e.
hunt
the
new
haven
does
have
plan
iii
piggyback,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
whereas
mr.
justice
brennan
has
already
suggested,
this
doesn't
correct
our
empty
boxcar
problem
where
we
have
empty
boxcars.
thank
you
very
much.
