577,
pointer
versus
texas.
ready?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
we'll
proceed
with
that
--
with
that
case
then.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
no
requirement
at
the
preliminary
examination
that
a
man
be
advised
of
his
rights
to
counsel
and
so
forth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
statute
doesn't
provide
for
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
doesn't
say
that
he
shall
advise
him
of
his
right
to
counsel
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
give
us
a
memorandum
of
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
pena.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
mister.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
pena,
who
but
the
complaining
witness
could
have
said
that
he
gave
--
gave
up
this
money
by
reason
of
the
force
and
the
fear
that
it
created
in
him
on
the
part
of
this
defendant.
who
could
have
--
who
could
have
supplied
that
important
element
of
the
crime?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
she
tell
what
was
in
the
mind
of
the
--
of
the
complaining
witness?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
then
the
lawyer
had
cross-examined
the
complaining
witness
and
had
in
some
way
or
another
discredited
his
testimony,
would
you
still
have
had
this
good
a
case
as
you've
got?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
well,
now
that
--
that's
what
cross-examination
is
afforded
for,
to
give
an
opportunity
to
do.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
all
it's
for.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
pena,
if
i
understood
counsel
correctly,
he
said
that,
if
--
if
this
testimony
had
not
been
introduced
in
the
trial
or
if
the
complaining
witness
had
been
present
at
the
trial
that
they
would
not
claim
error
in
this
case,
and
he
nods
his
head
now,
so
that's
--
that's
all
we're
dealing
with,
whether
this
man
was
entitled
to
confrontation,
whether
he
got
confrontation
to
this
procedure
that
you
have
--
have
used
or
whether
that's
an
item
of
a
fair
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know,
but
that
--
you
can't
unring
a
bell,
mr.
pena.
and
if
this
testimony
was
gotten
in
front
of
him
at
the
time
when
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer
and
he
didn't
have
a
fair
opportunity
to
cross-examine.
and
then
you
use
it
on
the
trial
against
him,
that's
the
gravamen
of
the
situation,
not
his
conduct
when
he
was
at
the
trial.
isn't
that
true?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose,
mr.
pena,
that
whether
the
examination
is
a
critical
part
of
the
procedure,
normally
it
could
be
changed
depending
upon
the
use
it
was
made
then,
couldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
they
complain
up
here,
not
--
not
that
they
didn't
--
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer
at
that
place
but
that
the
testimony
that
they
took
there
was
used
at
the
trial,
where
he
had
no
real
opportunity
to
cross-examine
such
as
a
man
would
have
he
been
advised
of
his
rights
to
have
a
lawyer
and
then
have
lawyer.
that's
a
critical
thing,
it
seems
to
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
finished
your
argument
mr.
harlan,
you
have
a
few
minutes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
harlan
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
before
you
sit
down,
i
would
like
to
express
thanks
from
the
court
to
you
for
representing
this
indigent
defendant.
we
realize
that
it's
a
great
burden
on
a
counsel
to
carry
a
case
to
this
court
in
that
manner,
but
it
is
a
public
service
and
we
appreciate
it.
so,
we
thank
you,
and
we
thank
you
mr.
pena
for
your
--
your
representation
of
the
interest
of
the
state
of
texas.
