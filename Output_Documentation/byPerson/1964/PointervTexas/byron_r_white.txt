(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
suggest
that
the
state
would
have
had
a
case
without
the
testimony
of
the
complaining
witness,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
you
were
making
a
point
that
--
that
you
were
at
least
inferring
that
the
lack
of
counsel
at
the
examining
trial
wasn't
the
state's
fault.
do
you
--
do
you
think
the
petitioner
here
could
have
had
counsel
in
this
trial
by
using
his
own
funds
and
resources?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
that
it
wasn't
the
state's
job
to
give
him
a
lawyer
at
his
examining
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
suggesting
that
whatever
the
rule
may
be
with
regard
to
an
indigent
defendant
who's
--
who
is
faced
with
testimony
at
his
trial
which
is
produced
at
the
examining
trial
that
if
the
fellow
can
hire
--
afford
to
hire
or
pay
his
own
lawyer
and
fails
to
do
so
for
purposes
of
an
examining
trial
he
hasn't
got
any
complaints
later.
if
the
appellant
can
actually
hire
his
own
lawyer
and
doesn't
do
it
that
that
gets
the
state
off
the
hook
if
they
want
to
--
if
it
wants
to
introduce
that
evidence
later
at
the
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
assuming
that
it
shows
it,
it
shows
that
he's
--
that
--
take
it
--
say
it
was
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
state
said
the
witness
was
in
california
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
moved
away.
and
that
therefore,
the
testimony
was
admissible.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
who
--
justice
byron
r.
white
who
finally
represented
him
on
his
trial?
