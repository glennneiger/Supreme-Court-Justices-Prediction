mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
this,
as
counsel
has
explained
to
the
court,
was
a
robbery
by
assault
case
wherein
the
defendant
was
apprehended
a
--
a
couple
of
blocks
from
the
scene
of
the
crime,
the
robbery.
the
date
of
the
offense
was
june
16,
1962.
now,
from
the
day
of
the
arrest,
there
were
nine
days
that
expired
--
from
the
date
of
the
arrest
to
the
day
of
the
examining
trial,
what
is
known
in
texas
as
examining
trial
is
a
preliminary
hearing.
at
that
time,
kenneth
phillips,
who
was
the
person
who
was
robbed,
testified
and
identified
the
defendant.
there
was
also
some
other
testimony
in
there
but
at
that
time,
there
was
a
positive
identification,
alright.
the
defendant,
pointer,
did
not
have
a
lawyer.
there
is
no
provision
in
texas
for
the
appointment
of
lawyers
at
the
examining
trial.
in
--
at
the
examining
trial
in
texas,
no
pleadings
have
to
be
made.
he
doesn't
have
to
enter
a
plea
of
guilty
or
not
guilty.
there
is
absolutely
nothing
that
he
has
to
do
but
just
sit
there
and
listen.
the
magistrate
will
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
probable
cause
to
binding
it
over
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
normally,
yes.
but
there
is
a
--
the
statute
does
not
say
that
the
state
has
to
be
present.
in
the
event
that
the
state
does
not
choose
to
be
present,
then
the
magistrate
inquires
into
the
facts
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
set
bail,
discharge
him,
or
send
him
to
the
grand
jury.
i
need
to
point
out
this
--
that
after
the
man
was
indicted.
the
case
was
originally
set
for
trial
on
august
14,
1962.
at
that
time,
on
motion
of
the
defendant,
the
case
was
--
was
passed
to
give
him
an
opportunity
to
obtain
counsel.
now,
at
this
time,
he
had
never
asked
for
counsel
up
to
this
time
and
the
court
was
never
appraised
of
the
fact
that
he
might
be
a
pauper
or
he
might
not
be
a
pauper.
the
case
was
passed
from
august
14th
to
september
the
17th.
at
that
time,
once
again,
the
case
was
called
for
trial
and
the
defendant
announced
that
he
was
not
ready.
he
needed
more
time
to
get
another
lawyer
--
a
lawyer.
so
once
again,
the
--
the
court
passed
the
case
but
at
that
time,
the
court
decided,
“well,
i
am
going
to
appoint
you
a
lawyer
by
the
name
of
--
of
charles
w.
gill,
just
in
case
you
don't
have
a
lawyer
the
next
time
the
case
comes
--
comes
to
trial.”
alright.
on
november
6th,
the
case
was
called
to
trial,
the
third
time.
it
had
five
months
that
expired
from
the
time
of
the
arrest
to
the
time
that
the
case
finally
went
to
trial.
at
that
time,
the
court
asked
for
the
announcement
of
whether
the
defendant
was
ready
or
not.
he
said
he
still
didn't
have
a
lawyer.
but
his
family
had
been
trying
to
get
mr.
c.
c.
divine
of
houston
to
represent
him.
well,
there
was
some
discussion
about
the
employment
of
counsel.
finally,
the
court
just
decided
to
go
ahead
and
proceed
with
the
case
and
appoint
c.
c.
divine
to
assist
mr.
gill
to
represent
the
defendant.
nowhere
did
the
defendant
ever
claim
to
be
pauper.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
that
he
was
acquainted
with
at
least
four
lawyers
in
houston,
texas.
he
had
paid
one
sam
hoover
and
that's
in
the
record,
a
sum
of
about
$600
to
represent
him
in
another
case.
he
had
called
on
one
john
cutler
to
represent
him
in
another
case.
clyde
gordon
--
i
point
these
out
because
to
--
to
point
out
that
this
man
was
a
person
who
was
appointed
with
a
number
of
lawyers
and
could
have
very
well
hired
himself
a
lawyer
to
represent
him
at
the
examining
trial.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
yes,
sir.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no,
sir.
i'm
not.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
yes,
sir.
i'm
familiar
with
that.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
yes.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
i
would
have
to
answer
that,
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
pointer
did
cross-examine
some
witness
at
the
examining
trial.
it
wasn't
phillips,
the
missing
witness
but
he
did
cross-examine
at
least
one
of
the
witnesses.
there
were
two
defendants
in
this
case
by
the
way
and
dillard,
the
other
defendant,
did
cross-examine
phillips.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no,
sir.
by
himself.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no,
sir.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no,
sir.
it
does
not.
but
let
me
say
this,
that
the
evidence
that
was
introduced
in
the
trial
was
overwhelming.
that
testimony
the
state
could
have
done
without.
i
didn't
try
the
case
but
i've
studied
the
record
and
let
me
point
out
that
there
was
one
eyeball
witness,
the
sister
of
phillips
who
testified,
she
was
sitting
outside
the
drive-in
while
the
robbery
was
being
--
in
progress.
she
and
her
brother
followed
the
defendant.
next,
there's
a
testimony
of
an
officer
who
arrived
at
the
scene
and
found
this
automobile
just
a
couple
of
blocks
from
the
drive-in.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
well,
no,
sir.
i
have
to
admit
that
--
that
testimony
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
i
think
so.
yes,
sir.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
it
would
have
been
the
state's
job,
your
honor,
had
he
asked
for
it,
and
if
he
couldn't
afford
one.
but
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
record
will
indicate
that
he
had
hired
lawyers
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
well,
of
course
in
that
case,
i
don't
think
the
evidence
would
be
--
the
testimony
would
be
admissible
because
the
state
would
have
to
show
why
the
witness
was
not
there.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
yes,
sir.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
well,
i
think
--
well,
of
course,
that's
his
choice
if
he
wants
to
not
hire
a
lawyer
for
the
trial.
he
could
just
go
ahead
and
try
it
himself
if
he
chose
to.
in
this
case
--
let
me
--
let
me
point
out
that
this
case
was
passed
on
two
occasions
at
--
on
the
motion
of
the
defendant.
the
state
was
ready
to
go
to
trial
but
the
defendant
wanted
more
time
and
more
time,
and
five
months
passed
from
the
date
of
the
offense
to
the
--
the
date
of
trial
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
--
to
help
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
a
court-appointed
lawyer
who
was
appointed
by
the
court
not
because
he
was
a
pauper
but
because
the
court
wanted
to
get
on
with
the
trial
and
a
lawyer
that
his
family
had
been
trying
to
retain,
c.
c.
divine
and
charles
w.
gill.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
yes,
he
was.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
i
don't
know.
he
is
up
here
your
honor
on
pauper's
oath.
i
know
the
case
is
up
on
the
pauper's
oath.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
yes,
sir.
he
appears
as
an
indigent.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
yes,
it
does.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
it
didn't
say
anything
at
all,
your
honor.
it
didn't
mention
it.
there
is
--
there
is
something
else
that
i
have
to
point
out
that
after
the
court
had
appointed
charles
w.
gill,
the
defendant
on
two
separate
occasions
refused
to
discuss
the
case
with
his
court-appointed
lawyer.
he
didn't
want
it.
he
didn't
want
a
court-appointed
lawyer,
and
that's
in
the
record.
that's
--
and
on
page
5
of
the
record,
there
--
the
testimony
by
pointer
himself
that
he
wrote
a
letter
to
this
lawyer
asking
him
--
relieving
--
to
relieve
him
of
appointment.
so
even
after
the
court
had
bent
over
backwards
and
appointed
him
a
lawyer
at
the
trial,
he
refused
to
--
the
defendant
refused
to
discuss
the
case
with
him.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
the
decision
that
this
court
will
make
is
whether
or
not
this
man
actually
got
a
fair
trial.
now,
we
take
the
position
that
the
testimony
offered
from
the
examining
trial
was
cumulative
of
the
--
the
rest
of
the
testimony.
now,
as
i
pointed
out
before,
there
--
there
was
eyeball
witness
to
the
--
to
the
robbery.
they
followed
the
defendant.
there
was
an
officer
who
found
his
car
parked
and
had
a
flat
tire.
there
was
a
dog,
who
went
from
the
automobile,
a
k9
police
dog
following
the
scent
of
the
7-eleven
food
store,
and
then
that
dog
crossed
the
street,
went
a
couple
more
blocks,
and
found
the
defendant.
this
is
how
the
defendant
was
apprehended.
there's
the
testimony
of
an
officer
who
arrested
him,
who
put
him
in
the
police
car,
and
in
the
police
car,
the
defendant
took
off
his
shoe
and
tried
to
--
to
dispose
the
$65
that
he
had
hidden
in
the
bottom
of
the
shoe.
there
was
also
$81
that
he
had
in
his
possession
from
the
money
that
was
stolen.
so,
the
fruits
of
the
crime
were
actually
found
on
the
defendant's
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
well,
it
was
attempted
to
be
done
by
the
sister
who
actually
observed
the
robbery.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no,
but
she
saw
the
expressions
on
his
--
on
--
on
her
brother's
face
and
there's
testimony
in
the
record
for
that
effect,
saw
the
face
of
the
--
of
her
brother,
saw
that
he
had
turned
pale
white.
and
i
realize
that
this
is
a
really
awkward
position
for
the
state
to
be
in
but
there
was
evidence
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
as
to
the
man's
guilt,
undoubtedly.
there
was
the
--
the
fruits
of
the
crime,
the
dog
who's
certainly
unbiased
and
who
followed
him
and
caught
him.
there
was
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
no,
sir.
and
neither
had
it
discredited
his
testimony.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
yes,
sir.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
there
was
also
part
of
that
testimony
that
was
introduced
by
the
defendant's
lawyer
during
the
trial
for
their
own
use,
so
that
the
state
was
not
the
only
who
offered
the
testimony.
some
of
it
was
offered
by
the
state
but
then
the
defendant
came
back
and
introduced
a
part
of
it
and
page
27
of
the
record
will
reflect
that
they
offered
part
of
the
cross-examination
by
dillard
into
evidence
during
the
trial.
so
they
took
advantage
of
this
testimony.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
your
honor
as
i
read
the
record
--
now,
i
realize
that
we've
assumed
that
there
was
an
objection
made.
now,
as
i
read
the
record
on
page
20
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
yes
sir,
that's
the
impression
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
well,
it
--
there's
--
there's
about
three
pages
of
--
of
testimony
between
the
court
and
mr.
divine
and
the
district
attorney.
in
there,
i
find
that
--
that
the
statements
like
--
like
this
for
mr.
divine,
“alright,
your
honor,
may
it
please
your
honor,
we
have
no
objection
to
this
testimony
here.”
that's
in
the
bottom
of
page
20.
then,
at
the
middle
of
page
21,
he
says,
“we
object
to
the
state
offering
all
or
any
part
on
the
grounds
that
they
haven't
properly
qualified
it
as
perpetuating
testimony
first.”
then
on
the
next
page,
continuing
the
discussion
with
the
court,
the
court,
“then
you
are
not
objecting
to
the
encircled
part
or
the
part
that
is
in
brackets?”
that
is
on
the
first
page
of
this
examining
trial
testimony.
mr.
divine,
“no,
sir.
i
have
no
objection
to
it.”
so
really,
i
don't
know
whether
they
did
or
not.
but
i
know
that
they
offered
part
of
it.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
so.
but
then
again,
we
are
faced
with
page
27
wherein
mr.
divine
offered
part
of
--
offered
part
of
the
testimony,
the
cross-examination
from
dillard.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
yes,
sir.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
yes
sir.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
that's
right.
in
closing,
i
would
like
to
say
this,
that
if
--
if
there
was
an
error
committed,
then
we
say
that
the
error
was
committed
by
the
trial
judge
in
allowing
that
testimony
to
be
introduced
an
evidence
at
the
trial.
we
do
not
feel
that
any
error
was
made
at
the
examining
trial.
and
i
--
i
make
that
statement
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
as
counsel
has
pointed
out,
your
honor,
we
have
no
way
in
the
world
to
appoint
counsel
to
examining
trials
and
even
after
the
court
appointed
him
a
lawyer.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
it's
true,
your
honor.
it's
true.
but
we
have
to
take
the
position
though
that
in
our
--
in
our
state,
there
was
no
provision
for
the
appointment
of
counsel
at
the
examining
trial.
that's
why
we
say
if
error
was
made,
it
was
made
at
the
trial
by
the
introduction
of
the
testimony.
but
not
because
it
was
the
critical
stage
of
proceedings
the
way
it
was
pointed
out
in
white
versus
maryland
or
in
hamilton
versus
alabama.
in
our
state,
the
examining
trial
is
not
a
critical
stage
of
proceeding
because
at
that
time,
the
defendant
does
not
have
to
say
anything.
he
is
not
barred
from
presenting
any
issues
of
insanity
or
alibi
or
any
pleas
and
abatement,
that
he
will
not
be
barred
from
presenting
any
of
those
pleas
at
the
time
of
trial.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
in
this
case
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
yes,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
i
believe
that's
right.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
gilbert
j.
pena
and
i
thank
the
court.
