but
phillips
had
been
available
as
a
witness
as
opposed
this
examining
trial
testimony
would
not
have
been
in
this
court.
justice
potter
stewart
then
that's
not
really
admissible.
that's
just
its
use
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
--
and
that
would
be
the
normal
course
--
that
would
be
--
it
is
the
normal
course
of
events
in
texas,
i
suppose,
because
generally
the
complaining
witnesses
are
available
for
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
trial,
the
ninth
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
ninth
case.
justice
potter
stewart
in
almost
40
years.
do
you
have
those
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
be
able
to
--
if
--
it's
maybe
easier
to
give
us
a
list
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
pena
the
--
however
that
may
be
the
upshot
of
this
was
because
of
the
complaining
witness'
absence
and
permanent
move
to
the
state
of
california,
the
upshot
of
this
was
that
the
defendant
was
denied
or
at
least
prevented
from
any
possibility
of
cross-examination
of
this
essential
witness
of
this
criminal
trial,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
a
case
in
this
court,
at
least
one
not
probably
good
as
many
others
implying
that
the
right
of
cross-examination
is
a
--
is
an
essential
constitutional
right.
that's
the
alford
case
in
282
u.s.
are
you
familiar
with
that
case?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
--
well,
it's
in
your
appellant
brief,
alford
against
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
--
and
if
i
understand
it,
in
the
normal
course
of
events
with
only
nine
exceptions,
apparently
or
the
nine
recorded
exceptions
in
the
last
40
years,
this
problem
would
not
arise
because
the
complaining
witness
presumably
would
be
present
at
the
criminal
trial,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
the
--
normally,
there
perhaps
wouldn't
be
the
necessity
for
counsel
at
the
--
what
you
call
the
examining
trial
or
the
preliminary
hearing.
but
--
but
when
this
problem
does
arise,
doesn't
what
happened
here
result
in
texas
through
its
prosecuting
attorney
and
judicial
system
by
admitting
this
transcript
of
the
complaining
witness'
prior
testimony
before
the
trial
doesn't
texas
deprive
the
defendant
of
the
right
of
cross-examination?
