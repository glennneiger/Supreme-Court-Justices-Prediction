mr.
orville
a.
harlan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
as
we
feel
the
same
as
presented
in
white
versus
maryland,
373
u.s.
59.
in
this
particular
case,
the
examining
trial
testimony
was
adduced
at
the
trial
upon
in
which
the
petitioner
was
convicted.
at
the
time
of
the
examining
trial,
the
petitioner
was
not
represented
by
counsel.
we
say
that
the
examining
trial
in
this
case
was
critical
for
this
was
the
only
opportunity
that
the
petitioner
had
for
cross-examining
the
complaining
witness.
and
we
feel
that
the
cross-examination
of
a
complaining
witness
in
a
criminal
proceeding
is
a
critical
stage
of
a
--
critical
stage
of
criminal
prosecution.
the
facts
briefly
in
the
case
are
that
the
petitioner
was
arrested
within
a
few
blocks
of
a
robbery
and
nine
days
later
--
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
within
a
few
blocks
of
a
recent
robbery.
and
nine
days
later,
an
examining
trial
was
held
pursuant
to
the
statutes
of
texas
to
--
at
which
time,
the
complaining
witness,
the
manager
of
the
drive-in
grocery
store,
testified
and
identified
the
petitioner
as
the
party
who
had
committed
the
robbery
and
his
testimony
also
gave
out
all
the
necessary
elements
of
the
offense
of
robbery
by
assault
under
texas
law.
the
petitioner
at
the
examining
trial
was
not
represented
by
counsel.
he
was
not
advised
that
he
had
a
right
to
counsel,
and
he
did
not
ask
for
a
contingence
to
secure
counsel
nor
was
counsel
offered
to
him.
at
the
trial
at
which
he
was
convicted,
the
complaining
witness
had
moved
to
california.
this
was
approximately
three
or
four
months
after
the
--
the
alleged
offense.
the
state
had
utilized
no
diligence
in
obtaining
the
witness
present
for
the
trial
but
instead
introduced
in
evidence
the
examining
trial
testimony
which
had
been
adduced
when
he
did
not
have
counsel.
i
like
to
point
out
that
he
did
have
a
counsel
at
the
trial
in
which
he
was
convicted
but
we
feel
that
the
fact
that
the
testimony
of
the
main
witness
in
the
case
being
adduced
when
he
did
not
have
a
counsel
was
tantamount
to
conducting
a
portion
of
the
trial
in
which
he
was
convicted
without
a
counsel.
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
yes,
your
honor.
counsel
at
the
trial
did
not
raise
white
versus
maryland.
he
objected
because
of
no
predicate
had
been
laid
for
the
intro
--
introduction
under
texas
law.
and
also,
he
did
make
two
objections,
i
believe,
the
record
will
reveal
as
to
denial
of
confrontment
of
witnesses.
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
actually,
the
--
there
was
some
problems
with
the
appointment
of
counsel.
apparently,
the
petitioner
for
one
reason
or
another,
he
wanted
other
counsel
than
that
which
he
had.
i
was
personally
appointed
after
the
trial
on
the
appeal.
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
discussing
white
versus
maryland
said
that
in
this
particular
case
that
it
was
not
a
critical
stage
in
as
much
as
the
examining
trials
in
texas
is
for
the
reason
--
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
an
accused
is
to
be
remanded
to
jail,
admitted
to
bail,
or
discharged.
and
they
attempted
to
distinguish
white
versus
maryland
and
so
stated
that
the
examining
trial
at
the
preliminary
hearing
as
it
is
called
in
maryland,
in
that
case,
was
critical
because
the
accused
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
speaking
was
forced
to
enter
a
plea,
which
we
submit
that
the
--
under
the
provisions
of
maryland
law,
the
examining
trial
in
maryland,
at
the
preliminary
hearing
in
maryland,
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
procedure
in
texas
because
at
white
versus
state
of
maryland,
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
on
page
882
of
177
atlantic
reporter
2d
is
approximately
the
same
language
that
was
--
that
our
court
of
criminal
appeals
used.
they
say
that
there
was
no
requirement,
nor
any
practical
possibility
under
our
present
criminal
procedure
to
appoint
counsel
for
appellant
at
the
preliminary
hearing
before
the
magistrate,
nor
was
it
necessary
for
appellant
to
enter
a
plea
at
that
time.
certainly,
it
was
under
maryland
procedure
that
it
was
necessary
at
the
arraignment
and
he
did
enter
a
plea
of
not
guilty
at
the
arraignment.
but
having
entered
a
plea
at
the
preliminary
hearing
of
guilty
that
was
later
used
in
evidence
against
him
at
the
trial
in
which
he
was
convicted
and
this
court
held
that
that
was
a
critical
stage
in
that
particular
case.
the
state
--
the
respondents
seems
to
say
in
their
brief
that
there's
no
denial
of
due
process
for
three
reasons.
one,
that
the
taking
the
position
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
did
at
the
examining
trial
was
not
a
critical
stage
because
it
was
for
the
limited
purpose
of
determining
whether
that
he
should
be
admitted
to
bail
or
remanded
to
jail
or
freed.
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
not
in
texas
--
under
texas
provisions
--
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
the
statute
provides,
your
honor,
that
he
had
--
it
does
provide,
i
beg
your
pardon,
for
advising
him
that
he
has
a
right
to
a
continuance
if
he
asks
for
it
to
secure
counsel.
under
texas
law,
the
state
and
the
defendant
himself
neither
necessarily
had
to
have
counsel.
if
there's
no
counsel
present,
the
justice
of
the
peace,
who
is
in
charge
of
conducting
the
examining
trial
asks
the
questions
and
that
is
reduced
to
writing.
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
my
understanding
of
the
statute
is
that
it
does
not.
actually,
the
examining
trial
testimony
--
examining
trial
in
texas
as
a
general
rule
is
strictly
for
that
purpose.
it
is
only
in
this
particular
instance
which
we
feel
that
that
was
critical
because
this
was
the
only
time
that
he
was
confronted
with
--
for
cross-examination
purposes
and
he
did
not
have
counsel
at
that
time.
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
yes,
your
honor.
it's
necessary
under
texas
law
in
the
robbery
by
assault
cases
that
the
--
someone
testified
--
that
the
robbery
occurred
through
forced
threats
or
fear.
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
and
this
--
the
complaining
witness
testified
as
to
these
essential
elements
that
man
--
the
robber
came
in
and
exhibited
a
pistol.
and
at
that
time
that
he
was
in
fear
of
his
life
or
serious
bodily
injury
and
gave
up
the
money
as
a
result
of
this.
no
other
testimony
from
any
other
witness
covers
these
essential
elements.
it's
our
position
that
if
the
exam
--
the
examining
trial
testimony
--
the
testimony
of
the
complaining
witness
was
not
in
the
case,
then
there
would
have
been
no
problem
as
to
securing
an
instructed
verdict
of
not
guilty
because
you
have
to
have
these
elements.
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
he
had
moved
to
california
after
the
robbery
and
before
the
main
trial.
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
the
record
does
not
reveal,
your
honor.
we
have
in
texas,
as
a
number
of
states
do.
they
have
enacted
the
uniform
act
to
secure
the
attendance
of
witnesses.
several
years
before
this
particular
case,
a
defendant
had
attempted
to
introduce
an
examining
trial,
i
believe,
testimony
--
no,
i
beg
your
pardon.
he
had
--
he
had
attempted
to
secure
the
attendance
of
the
--
of
the
witness
--
allow
me
again.
he
had
tried
to
introduce
the
examining
trial
testimony
and
the
state
opposed
him
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
said
that
--
that
they
did
not
have
to
use
any
diligence
under
the
uniform
act
that
it
was
alright
to
use
the
examining
trial
testimony.
and
they
--
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
cite
that
particular
case
saying
that
the
state
is
not
required
to
exercise
any
diligence
to
reproduce
the
testimony.
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
it
would
only
be
admissible,
your
honor,
to
impeach
him
if
--
if
it
was
possible
at
--
at
all.
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
yes,
that
would
be
for
the
use
actually
of
the
--
of
the
defendant.
the
state
--
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
yes.
actually,
pointer
since
1927
is
the
ninth
case
in
which
--
that
i've
been
able
to
locate,
in
which
the
examining
trial
testimonies
have
been
introduced
into
evidence
--
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
at
the
trial.
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
the
ninth
since
1927.
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
i
do
not
have
them
cited
for
purposes
of
argument,
but
i
did
not
quote
entirely
here
the
citations
and
i'd
be
glad
to
give
them.
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
--
to
be
placed.
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
if
he
had
testified
at
the
trial,
i
--
i
would
have
seen
no
federal
grounds.
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
if
it
had
not
been
introduced.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
oh,
the
only
way
that
it
is
critical,
if
it
please
the
court,
is
the
same
way
that
the
white
case
was
--
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
it
is
not
a
normal
proceeding
at
all
and
i
don't
think
that
for
this
court
to
reverse
this
case
would
cause
any
stir
in
texas.
i
--
i
don't
think
that
it's
necessary.
the
general
rule
to
appoint
counsel
in
examining
trial
because
generally,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
it
doesn't
serve
this
type
of
purpose.
it's
only
in
a
rare
instance
that
the
complainant
or
--
or
the
necessary
witness
does
not
appear.
but
i
--
i
feel
that
the
--
with
some
diligence
that
the
state
may
have
at
the
time
--
this
is
my
own
conjecture
--
may
have
been
able
to
determine
that
--
that
mr.
phillips
would
not
be
available.
and
if
that
were
so,
why
certainly,
there
are
procedures
in
texas
for
having
notice
to
the
defendant
having
secured
counsel
and
--
and
the
stage
is
--
is
set
then
for
the
reproduction
later
on.
but
we
feel
though
that
white
versus
maryland
certainly
is
the
white
horse
case
in
this
case
which
i
see
no
difference
between
the
--
the
examining
trial
or
the
preliminary
hearing
as
they
call
it
in
maryland,
and
the
plea
of
guilty
that
was
entered
there.
and
the
examining
trial
in
texas
and
the
cross
--
the
lack
of
cross-examination
of
the
complaint
witness
in
this
case
and
we
feel
that
white
versus
maryland
controls
disposition
of
this
cause.
thank
you.
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
now,
i
would
like
to
give
one
observation
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
may.
i
agree
with
the
chief
justice
that
this
was
the
critical
area,
but
mr.
pena
has
indicated
in
his
brief
and
by
argument
here
before
the
court
a
third
issue
as
--
and
that
would
be
what
i
recall
waiver
by
estoppel
that
his
conduct
immediately
prior
to
the
trial
in
which
he
was
convicted
should
be
implied
that
--
that
he
had
waived
counsel
back
at
the
examining
trial.
certainly,
the
opinions
of
this
court
among
which
are
carnley
versus
cochran,
gibbs
versus
burke,
johnson
versus
zerbst,
rice
versus
olsen,
and
uveges
versus
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania,
all
indicate
that
waiver
must
be
knowingly
and
understandingly
made.
and
in
rice
versus
olsen
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
implied
waiver
from
a
plea
of
guilty
and
this
court
held
that
you
cannot
imply
a
waiver
by
conditions
subsequent
such
as
a
plea
of
guilty.
and
i
feel
that
the
same
thing
here
if
you
call
this
waiver
by
estoppel
because
of
his
conduct
later
on
that
he
still
was
not
advised
of
his
right
to
counsel
and
he
did
not
understandingly
and
knowingly
waived
counsel
at
the
examining
trial.
and
this
is
a
critical
area
and
we
feel
that
it
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
mr.
orville
a.
harlan
yes,
sir.
