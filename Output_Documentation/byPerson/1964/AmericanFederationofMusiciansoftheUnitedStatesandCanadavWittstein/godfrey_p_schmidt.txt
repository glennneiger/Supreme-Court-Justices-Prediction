mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
if
your
honors
please,
before
i
address
myself
to
the
legal
questions
here
and
to
an
attempt
that
briefly
refuting
the
arguments
made
by
my
adversary.
i
should
like
to
--
with
the
court's
indulgence,
refer
to
the
specific
fact
background
which
serves
as
the
point
of
departure
for
this
entire
controversy.
this
union
had
for
many
years
imposed
upon
orchestra
leader
employers
a
certain
tax
or
exaction
known
on
the
one
hand
as
the
10%
traveling
surcharge
and
on
the
second
place
as
the
local
tax.
and
they
required
orchestra
leader
employers
to
pay
this
tax
by
--
for
--
on
behalf
of
the
sidemen
who
were
the
employees
of
these
orchestras.
this
constituted
the
basis
for
previous
litigation
which
came
in
part
all
the
way
to
this
court
and
this
court
refused
certiorari,
agreed
--
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
second
circuit
agreeing
that
these
were
unlawful
exactions
imposed
upon
my
clients
under
article
--
section
302
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
now
the
union
here
was
put
on
notice
as
early
as
1960
by
the
filing
of
the
complaint
and
in
1961,
by
the
court
of
appeals
decision
and
again
in
1962
that
their
bylaws
needed
revision
because
they
were
not
inline
with
the
section
302.
and
they
approached
the
66th
convention
in
june
of
1963
without
so
much
as
publicizing
to
anyone
to
any
delegate
or
to
any
local
the
method
by
which
they
attempted
to
adjust
their
bylaws
to
section
302.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honors
the
actual
intra-union
legislation
which
they
used
for
the
purpose
of
making
that
adjustment
so
as
to
legalize
their
own
constitution
was
put
on
the
desks
of
the
delegates
six
hours
before
the
midnight
session
at
which
it
was
passed,
the
voting
begun
at
ten
minutes
past
midnight.
now,
i
submit
that
whatever
and
that
--
if
i
have
the
court's
indulgence
to
refer
a
portion
of
the
record
for
one
moment.
i
would
like
to
refer
to
page
115
(a)
your
honors.
this
is
the
only
portion
of
the
verbatim
transcript
of
this
convention
which
are
in
behalf
of
my
clients
was
able
to
get.
i
asked
for
the
full
transcript
and
it
was
denied
me.
and
i
refer
to
the
middle
of
page
115,
where
a
delegate
who
is
not
named
stands
up
apparently
to
a
microphone
number
3
and
says,
“mr.
chairman,
it
seems
to
me”
and
then
he
refers
to
the
microphone
he's
using,
microphone
3,
"mr.
chairman,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
matter
of
such
great
importance
is
this
to
be
placed
in
a
voice
vote
is
ridiculous
because
it's
going
to
be
a
matter
of
who
out
yells
who.
i
think
we
should
set
the
machinery
in
motion
tonight
or
tomorrow
morning
for
a
ballot
vote.
this
will
give
the
only
real
reaction.”
now
it
appears
from
other
portions
of
the
record
that
there
were
two
previous
voice
votes,
and
my
complaint
here
alleges
that
both
of
those
voice
votes
were
against
the
resolution.
but
let
that
out
of
the
picture
for
a
moment
and
proceed.
mr.
kennen
(ph),
the
president
of
the
union
who
is
also
a
lawyer
immediately
says,
“well,
a
roll
call
vote
is
what
you
are
referring
to.
any
ten
delegates
or
five
locals
may
ask
for
a
roll
call
vote
if
you
are
dissatisfied
with
a
voice
vote.”
now
i
submit
that
right
there
was
a
downright
misrepresentation
of
what
valid
vote
means.valid
voting
is
the
kind
of
voting
as
your
honors
know
that
is
most
commonly
used
in
unions.
this
voice
vote,
i
mean
this
roll
call
vote
is
not
like
the
roll
call
vote
used
in
congress
nor
is
it
like
the
roll
call
vote
justified
by
robert's
rules
of
order.
this
is
a
peculiar
situation
which
enables
the
delegates
to
cast
the
whole
vote
of
their
membership,
and
incidentally
your
honors,
there
is
nothing
in
the
bylaws
to
warrant
the
splitting
of
votes,
as
they
were
split
here,
and
at
least
26,000
votes
were
duplicate
votes
because
of
the
fact
that
many
orchestra
leaders
do
and
many
orchestra
members
belong
to
1,
2,
3
and
as
much
as
7.
i
think
there's
one
that
belongs
to
seven
locals
of
this
federation.
so
that
the
same
person's
vote
was
sometimes
cast
one
time
one
way
and
one
time
another
way.
now,
i
would
not
be
here
your
honor,
i
would
never
have
started
this
action
if
there
had
been
any
approach
to
this
democracy
or
to
this
representative
character
that
is
so
often
flaunted
in
my
adversary's
brief.
but
on
analysis
and
as
a
further
reading
of
this
shows
there
wasn't
a
scintilla
of
representative
or
democratic
regulation
or
government
here,
because
in
the
first
place,
the
people
at
home,
in
the
home
locals
had
never
heard
of
recommendation
number
11
before
the
convention.
in
ordinary
cases
and
here
i
differ
with
the
solicitor
general
and
the
afl-cio
brief,
they
interpolate
the
story
which
to
the
effect
that
there
are
19
other
unions
that
use
this
peculiar
roll
call
vote.
well
i
submit,
there's
no
evidence
of
that
in
the
record.
i
didn't
have
a
chance
to
cross-examine
whether
those
other
systems
of
roll
call
vote
are
just
as
much
out
of
use
as
they
were
in
the
case
of
this
union
this
being
the
first
time
it
was
used.
i
didn't
have
a
chance
to
find
out
whether
or
not
prior
to
the
use
of
this
system
of
roll
call
voting
the
unions
at
home
had
had
a
chance
to
vote
on
instructions
to
their
delegates.
you
see,
there
would've
been
some
pretense
i
think,
and
not
pretense
they
would've
been
some
actuality
of
genuine
representative
government
or
democratic
procedure
if
this
recommendation
number
11
had
first
been
disseminated
to
the
locals
so
that
the
locals
at
least
had
an
opportunity
to
instruct
their
delegates.
but
they
knew
nothing
whatever
about
it.
indeed,
the
delegates
themselves
did
not
know
about
it
until
six
hours
before
the
election.
and
i
submit
that
that
makes
a
great
difference
here.
now,
i
agree
that
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
yes
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
my
opposition
to
the
granting
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
stressed
these
matters.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
is
your
honor
reading
from
the
--
my
brief?
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
well,
i
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
i
reframed
the
questions
in
a
different
way
because
i
did
not
agree
with
that
statement
of
the
questions
and
for
that
reason
i
say
--
i
gave
the
answer
that
i
did
give
to
your
honor.
now,
i
might
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
on
the
--
what
your
honor?
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
no,
i
do
not
think
the
decision
below
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
i
think
the
decision
below
was
based
purely
on
a
question
of
interpreting
the
statute,
but
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
i
don't
think
so
your
honor,
because
i
don't
think
that
an
academic
question
insulated
from
the
facts
in
which
the
issue
is
rooted
can
be
presented
to
your
honors.
i
think
that
any
discussion
of
law
must
be
based
upon
the
facts
peculiar
to
the
case,
and
this
is
the
reason
why
i
framed
a
counterstatement
of
facts.
and
this
is
the
reason
why
in
my
counterstatement
of
facts
i
went
into
these
things.
and
if
--
with
your
indulgence,
i'd
like
to
pursue
for
one
moment
further
this
peculiar
statement
of
facts
as
contained
not
in
any
argument
of
mine
but
in
their
own
verbatim
minutes
of
this
convention.
again
i
refer
to
page
115,
after
having
misinterpreted
the
unknown
delegates
request
for
a
ballot
vote
as
meaning
this
most
unusual
roll
call
vote
immediately,
right
on
the
spot
the
chair
recognized
mr.
merle
schneider,
local
680
--
368
of
reno,
nevada
and
he
promptly
says,
“i
call
for
a
roll
call
vote,
i
have
local
2s
--“
and
he
mentions
six
locals,
or
five
or
six
locals.
now
it
could
not
possibly
have
happened
that
quickly.
he
couldn't
have
gotten
around
in
that
instant
between
the
request
of
the
delegate
and
the
misinterpretation
of
the
delegate's
remark,
this
was
prearranged.
and
this
prearrangement
meant
that
they
were
railroading
this
recommendation
number
11
through
the
convention
without
having
--
given
any
delegates
prior
to
the
convention
any
notice
whatever
of
this.
and
i
say
this
is
the
real
vice.
now
let
me
address
myself,
it
--
that's
the
real
vice
in
the
fact,
now
let
me
address
myself
very
briefly
to
the
law.
i
will
agree
that
the
statute
as
its
written
is
not
specific
on
this
point.
i
will
also
agree
that
the
legislative
history
recites
no
case
directly
in
point.
i
was
personally
involved
in
some
of
the
cases
that
went
through
the
mcclellan
committee,
the
paper
local
case,
the
rigged
election
of
the
harper
case.
those
were
two
cases
in
which
i
was
personally
involved
and
i
know
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
motivated
congress
in
passing
the
mcclellan
act
was
to
ensure
a
little
bit
more
genuine
democracy
or
a
representative
procedure
that
had
prevailed
before.
and
i
submit
that
that
legislative
purpose
carries
over
to
particular
portions
of
the
statute
such
as
we
have
here.
now,
i
had
in
my
brief
on
page
22
taken
first
of
all
after
i
had
discussed
the
purpose
the
context
in
which
this
particular
language
is
found.
and
at
the
bottom
of
page
22,
i
refer
to
the
contextual
construction
of
the
statute.
and
there
i
found
that
five
times
in
that
particular
section,
that
is
101
(a)
(3)
of
the
landrum-griffin
act,
the
word
--
the
words
majority
vote
were
used
five
times.
and
in
four
of
those
times
there
can
be
no
question
whatever
of
what
the
congress
meant
one
person,
one
vote,
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
this
is
the
normal
presumption
in
these
matters
because
i
don't
know
whether
these
various
other
locals
that
are
referred
to
or
other
unions
affiliated
with
the
a.f.
of
m.
had
have
additional
provisions
which
would
guarantee
opportunity
to
the
home
folks
in
the
various
locals
across
the
country
to
be
acquainted
with
what
is
going
forward.
for
example,
i
noticed
that
my
learned
adversary
referred
to
senator
mcclellan's
bill
116
--
1137,
which
if
the
first
paragraph
of
the
relevant
portion
is
read
would
seem
to
signify
that
he
was
giving
carte
blanche
to
a
union
to
weigh
votes
as
he
wanted
--
as
it
wanted.
but
he
had
--
he
did
not
allow
that
paragraph
to
stand
alone,
as
i
point
out
on
page
--
the
bottom
of
page
51
of
my
brief,
he
had
a
section
underneath
called
notices
of
meetings
or
conventions
which
guaranteed
that
a
convention
camarilla
couldn't
possibly
control
the
convention
without
first
giving
notice
to
everybody
in
the
field.
now,
i
ask
your
honors
to
consider
for
a
moment
the
consequences
of
the
kind
of
rule
that
is
being
advocated
by
my
learned
adversary.
a
few
large
locals
having
the
largest
number
of
members
would
be
cultivated
by
the
incumbents
in
office.
they
could
strike
up
alliances
and
they
could
run
any
convention.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
peculiar
convention
they
permitted
15
men
only
to
debate
this
question,
to
make
speeches
on
this
question
at
that
evening
session
that
passed
it.
and
it
is
of
strange
coincidence
your
honors
that
of
the
15
men
who
were
permitted
to
discuss
this
convent
--
this
important
bill,
considered
by
some
of
the
delegates
as
appears
from
the
record,
as
the
most
important
question
ever
to
confront
an
a.f.
of
m.
convention.
of
those
15
your
honor,
nine
were
handpicked
members
of
committees
appointed
by
the
president
himself.
the
very
day
before
the
convention,
the
president
himself
as
i
point
out
in
my
brief,
addressed
the
canadian
delegates
and
pointed
out
that
the
situation
that
had
been
obtaining
up
to
that
kind
where
they
had
been
imposing
the
10%
traveling
surcharge
and
the
1.5%
local
tax
was
an
immoral
situation.
those
--
that
was
his
adjective,
immoral,
because
it
placed
the
burden
of
support
of
the
union
upon
those
members
only
who
were
active.
here
was
a
local
in
new
york
of
30,000
members,
and
approximately
3000
of
the
30,000
were
really
active
professional
musicians
and
because
they
were
taxed
on
all
of
their
income
and
they
made
most
of
the
income
they
bore
the
burden,
and
the
same
way
traveling
orchestras
throughout
the
country.
they're
the
most
active
today
and
they
bore
the
burden.
and
i
say
your
honor
that
for
that
--
for
these
reasons
this
procedure
can't
be
considered
in
vacuo,
it
can't
be
considered
as
abstracted
from
its
roots
in
the
fact
situation.
i
know
of
no
legislative
test
of
construction
except
the
old
ones
and
this
court
has
had
many
occasions
to
repeat
the
various
tests
where
there
is
not
specific
and
mathematically
precise
language,
where
as
seneca
says
in
one
of
its
epistulae
morales,
“nothing
is
too
often
repeated
if
that
is
not
sufficiently
learned.”
this,
we
go
first
if
we
can't
it
directly
from
a
statute
we
go
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
and
then
if
we
can't
get
it
there,
we
go
to
the
purpose
of
the
particular
statute
--
the
particular
section,
the
contextual
construction
then
the
circumstances
surrounding
it.
whether
or
not
the
interpretation
i
am
urging
leads
to
absurd
results.
it
would
lead
to
absurd
results
your
honor
if
you
adopted
a
ratio
of
voting
such
as
mr.
--
judge
marshall
below
suggested.
he
said
in
his
dissenting
opinions
that
my
interpretation
of
the
statute
would
mean
that
a
union
with
280,000
members
would
have
to
have
a
convention
of
14,000
delegates
that
have
cost
at
$5
million.
well
of
course
that's
not
so,
unless
you
are
foolish
enough
to
--
as
a
union
leader,
to
ask
for
a
representation
at
the
ratio
of
one
delegate
to
every
20
members.
but
if
you
take
the
normal
ratio
of
one
delegate
to
every
250
or
300,
you
won't
have
an
excessive
number.
and
i
say
that
my
interpretation
does
not
lead
to
any
absurd
results.
and
finally
i
say
your
honor
that
when
mr.
justice
--
when
mr.
meany
was
asked
about
his
opinion
on
this
matter,
he
pointed
out
both
before
the
congressional
committee
and
in
the
affidavit
submitted
in
this
record
that
the
usual
method
of
representation
is
the
kind
that's
used
in
the
house
of
representatives
that
is
to
say,
you
apportion
the
number
of
delegates
according
to
the
number
they
represent.
a
large
union
would
have
many
delegates.
a
small
union
would
have
only
one.
and
i
think
that
is
the
only
way
to
do
it
because
it
seems
to
me
that
on
theory
and
on
acceptation
of
the
standards
of
representative
government
and
democracy
that
we
are
familiar
with
in
the
anglo-saxon
tradition.
it's
the
height
of
absurdity
to
say
that
there
was
democratic
representation
here,
because
these
men
had
to
make
up
their
minds
ten
minutes
after
midnight
right
then
and
there
how
they
were
going
to
vote
and
how
they
were
going
to
split
their
votes.
and
some
of
the
--
one
vote
that
was
split,
as
appears
from
the
proceedings
was
split
on
this
strange
ratio,
i
think
it
was
local
205.
they
had
three
delegates,
541
members
and
they
cast
one
vote
one
way
and
540
votes
the
other
way.
i
don't
understand
how
this
can
be
equated
to
anything
that
resembles
a
majority
vote.
majority
vote
to
me,
and
i
think
in
the
tradition
of
the
west
means,
(a)
that
the
majority
knows
something
about
it.
that
the
majority
is
knowledgeable,
that
the
majority
is
informed
that
there
be
some
kind
of
communication
or
rapport
between
the
representatives
and
the
constituency.
there
was
no
such
thing
here.
and
i
say
on
that
ground
and
for
the
other
grounds
that
i
have
alleged
in
my
brief,
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
on
the
number
of
delegates?
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
the
largest
union?
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
well,
i
--
the
way
i
would
look
at
it
your
honor
is
that
congress
intended
to
approve
what
is
most
commonly
used
in
unions
today,
namely
a
large
num
--
a
large
union
like
local
802
in
new
york
which
has
28
to
30,000
members.
i've
heard
both
numbers
quoted,
would
have
more
delegates
on
ratio
we'll
say
of
250
or
300
to
one.
whereas
small
delegates
--
small
unions
would
have
only
one
delegate.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
well
it
would
depend,
your
honor,
on
the
ratio
that
would
be
used,
(voice

--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
that's
right,
there
were
only
three
and
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
the
local
--
based
--
they
cast
28
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
--
thousand,
i'll
tell
you
exactly
your
honor
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
it
had
two,
your
honor,
one
was
ill.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
three
authorized.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
no.
i
think
that
method
is
wholly
wrong
too.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
i
think
there
should
be
more
to
be
democratic
because
it
seems
to
me
that
debate
means
that
you
get
additional
talent,
because
the
whole
idea
of
representation
is
not
that
mere
numbers
count
but
rather
that
it
is
true
on
an
average
that
what
a
greater
number
of
people
decide
is
more
apt
to
be
right
than
what
a
smaller
number
decides.
now
that's
not
always
true
as
historical
generalization,
but
i
think
that
this
is
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
they
spoke
of
a
one
vote
--
when
they
spoke
in
language
that
to
me
means
one
person,
one
vote.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
20
was
it?
20.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
oh
no,
if
they
did
that
they
would
have
14,000
delegates.
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
another
thing
that
shockingly
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
they
do
here
--
what
they
should
do
here
is
what
they've
done
in
other
unions.
they
say
every
union
--
every
local
shall
have
at
least
one
vote
no
matter
what
its
size
up
to
--
we'll
say,
150.
after
150
every
add
--
union
shall
have
an
additional
delegate
for
every
250
or
300
or
something
like
that.
this
is
commonly
done
in
unions,
and
i
might
say
that
one
of
the
things
that's
wrong
with
this
situation
is
to
have
a
scattering
of
so
many
small
unions
over
the
country
and
such
a
very
large
one,
stupendously
large,
in
new
york
city.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
same
procedure
is
the
procedure
followed
by
most
unions
where
they
have
only
20.
they
won't
issue
a
charter
unless
they
got
more.
most
unions
will
require
that
there'll
be
a
larger
membership
than
merely
20
before
a
charter
is
issued.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
well,
i
certainly
do.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
oh,
i
think
more
--
that
would've
been
outrageously
too
much.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
i
have
suggested
in
my
brief
that
a
fair
proportion
would
be
as
follows.
well
the
first
150
or
less,
they
should
have
one
delegate.
after
that
they
should
have
additional
delegates
for
each
250
to
300
members
in
a
union.
and
now
that
would
take
care
of
the
situation
in
a
manner
in
which
it
is
taken
cared
of
in
most
unions
that
i'm
familiar
with.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
well
i
don't
think
the
court
should
have
to
work
that
out.
i
think
that
the
interpretation
made
by
the
court
below
is
an
interpretation
of
what
congress
worked
out.
and
congress
said
that
it
should
be
one
vote,
one
delegate
as
i
read
the
statute.
now
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
one
vote,
one
delegate
for
the
--
in
other
words
each
delegate
should
have
one
vote
and
one
vote
only.
and
if
they
want
to
take
care
of
this
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
no,
congress
did
not.
no,
congress
did
not,
but
i
think
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
no,
they
did
not
in
my
judgment.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
i
do
not
read
the
language
as
saying
any
specific
ratio,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
yes,
i
think
that
would
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
i
think
that
that's
impractical
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
yes
and
i
think
it
violates
common
sense
your
honor,
and
it
violates
the
common
usage
in
unions
today.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
no.
i
must
say
that
so
far
as
the
constitutional
question
is
--
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
no,
i
still
don't
think
so
your
honor
because
i
think
that
i
agree
with
that
federalist,
which
i
quoted
that
when
you
tend
to
have
deliberative
bodies
too
big,
you
introduce
the
element
of
demagogy
and
other
undesirable
consequences.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
oh,
i
didn't
say
that
your
honor.
mr.
godfrey
p.
schmidt
oh,
i
think
it
can,
it'd
be
too
small
and
too
big.
thank
you
your
honor.
