justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
the
decision
below
based
in
any
--
to
any
part
expressly
on
the
matters
you
mentioned?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
decision
below
based
on
any
part
expressly
on
the
matters
that
you
mentioned?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
about
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
(inaudible)
and
aren't
those
the
questions
--
isn't
that
the
question
that
was
presented
here
in
the
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
schmidt,
there
were
only
three
for
the
very
largest
union
in
this
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
largest
local?
how
many
members?
justice
byron
r.
white
28,000?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
union
had
only
--
that
local
had
only
three
delegates
at
this
convention,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
there
are
three
authorized.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
the
maximum
that
was
authorized
under
con
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
wouldn't
attempt
to
even
--
to
uphold
the
validity
of
this
method
of
apportioning
delegates.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
should
be
more.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
say
it'd
be
ridiculous
to
suggest
the
big
union
ought
to
be
represented
by
enough
delegates
to
--
by
one
delegate
for
every
20
members?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
fit
on
practical
ground?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
the
only
--
but
it's
just
--
this
is
too
expensive
and
it's
impractical.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
hasn't
got
anything
to
do
with
the
--
with
how
much
power
to
use
the
union.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
if
it
were
practical
to
have
one
delegate
there
for
every
20
members
that
would
be
of
reasonable
matter,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
can
also
be
too
small,
i
take
it?
