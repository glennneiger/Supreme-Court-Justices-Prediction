mr.
henry
kaiser
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
issue
presented
is
one
of
interpreting
and
applying
section
101
(a)
(3)
(b)
(i)
of
the
landrum-griffin
act
and
we've
set
forth
the
statute
on
page
58
and
page
59
of
the
blue
brief,
our
brief.
the
critical
language
provides
that
unions
may
not
at
conventions
raise
dues
or
other
membership
obligations
except
and
i
quote,
“by
majority
vote
of
the
delegates
voting
at
a
regular
convention”.
specifically,
the
question
before
your
honors
is
whether
as
the
court
below
held
that
language
requires
that
the
majority
could
be
determined
by
assigning
to
each
delegate
one
vote
or
whether
as
we
contend
and
as
the
solicitor
general
agrees
that
majority
may
also
be
determined
by
waiting
each
delegate's
vote
in
a
manner
that
reflects
the
strength
of
his
constituency.
the
pertinent
facts
upon
which
this
issue
arises
may
be
briefly
stated.
at
its
1963
convention,
petitioner,
american
federation
of
musicians
raised
the
dues
and
the
initiation
fees
of
its
some
280,000
members.
these
members
belong
to
675
affiliated
locals
ranging
in
size
from
the
membership
of
petitioner
local
802,
a
membership
of
some
28,000
down
to
the
local
in
waupaca,
wisconsin
with
a
membership
of
20.
these
members
are
represented
at
annual
conventions
of
the
federation,
the
highest
governing
and
legislative
body
lf
the
union,
by
delegates
who
are
elected
each
year
by
a
secret
ballot.
article
5
of
the
federation's
constitution
which
is
set
forth,
i
believe
on
page
3
of
our
brief,
footnote
2,
governs
the
number
of
delegates
available
to
each
local
as
well
as
the
voting
procedures
at
the
convention.
that
article
provides
that
no
local
or
that
every
local
no
matter
how
small
is
entitled
to
at
least
one
delegate
and
that
no
local
no
matter
how
large
is
entitled
to
more
than
three.
thus
under
the
laws
of
the
federation,
a
local
like
that
of
oshkosh
with
276
members
is
entitled
to
the
same
three
delegates
as
the
new
york
local
with
its
28,000
members.
at
the
1963
convention,
the
federation
acted
pursuant
to
the
roll
call
provision
of
article
5
by
which
on
proper
call
or
proper
demand
made
by
five
locals,
a
roll
call
is
taken
and
each
delegate
is
authorized
to
vote
the
full
number
of
the
members
from
the
local
he
comes
from.
on
that
count,
the
resolution
raising
the
dues
and
initiation
fees
was
carried
by
some
44,000
votes.
we
concede
that
there
was
not
a
majority
of
the
actual
delegates
present
voting
in
favor
of
the
resolution.
two
separate
suits
were
filed
one
against
each,
while
there
were
some
--
i
forgot
the
precise
number
i
think
110,076
delegates
physically
present.
there
was
not
a
majority
of
those
individual
delegates
in
support
of
the
resolution.
mr.
henry
kaiser
without
the
weighted
vote.
mr.
henry
kaiser
precisely,
yes.
mr.
henry
kaiser
there'd
be
no
case.
mr.
henry
kaiser
that
is
right
sir.
mr.
henry
kaiser
three,
well
actually
at
that
convention
there
were
only
two
who
are
present
as
delegates.
mr.
henry
kaiser
those
two
cast
the
28,000
votes.
mr.
henry
kaiser
yes
sir.
mr.
henry
kaiser
they
split
the
votes.
mr.
henry
kaiser
now
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
this
was
a
question
of
raising
dues.we
have
a
different
system
for
electing
officer.
mr.
henry
kaiser
that
has
been
on
the
books,
if
the
court
please,
at
least
40
years.
mr.
henry
kaiser
as
far
as
i'm
aware
--
so
far
as
i'm
aware,
this
is
the
first
time
that
the
provision,
the
roll
call
provision
was
invoked
at
a
convention
of
the
federation.
mr.
henry
kaiser
there
are
many
unions
that
vote
that
way.
i'll
get
to
that
but
i
can
state
right
now
that
the
68
of
the
131
affiliates
of
the
afl-cio
have
weighted-voting
of
some
kind.
19
of
them
have
the
precise
type
that
we
have
and
the
remainder
different
gradations
of
weighting
the
votes
of
delegates.
the
suits
were
brought,
as
i
said
against
each
petitioner
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
those
increased
dues.
on
proper
motion,
the
suits
were
consolidated
and
the
district
court
granted
the
injunctions
requested.
the
court
said
he
was
forced
to
that
conclusion
because
in
his
view,
the
procedure
of
the
convention
failed
to
comply
with
what
he
called
the
mandatory
provisions
of
the
statute
i
quoted.
on
appeal,
the
circuit
court
affirmed
by
a
two
to
one
vote.
in
announcing
its
decision,
the
majority
acknowledged
that
the
procedure
followed
by
the
convention
was
the
most
democratic
one.
the
majority
recognized
that
it
was
a
widespread
practice
among
national
unions
and
it
also
agreed
that
there
were
no
abuses
found
by
the
congress
to
have
flourished
onto
what
it
called
aegis
of
the
weighted-voting
system.
nevertheless,
it
thought
the
language
so
compellingly
clear
as
to
render
it
unable
to
perceive
any
meaning
to
that
language
other
than
one
delegate,
one
vote.
now
if
the
court
please,
the
effect
of
that
decision
below
as
i've
already
indicated,
was
to
outlaw
the
practices
of
over
a
majority
of
the
national
affiliates
of
the
afl-cio.
even
more
important
if
the
court
please,
if
you
think
upon
it
as
a
realistic
and
practical
matter,
the
effect
of
that
decision
is
to
impose
upon
all
unions
by
legislative
mandate,
a
permanent
condition
of
an
equal
representation
that
convention
voting
for
dues
increases.
now
did
the
congress
did
so
--
do
so
and
could
it
constitutionally
do
so?
we
say
no
to
both
questions.
we
say
that
the
language
does
not
compel
the
assignment
to
congress
of
so
wanting
an
objective
and
we
say
further
that
that
interpretation
flouts
the
clear
legislative
history
of
that
section
is
at
war
with
other
provisions
of
the
same
statute,
completely
ignores
the
universally
conceded
policy
of
the
statute.
and
if
we
are
wrong
in
all
of
those,
and
we
doubt
that
error,
we
say
it
was
beyond
the
constitutional
power
of
the
congress
to
do
so.
now
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
i
should
like
to
reserve
that
question
but
its
--
i
will
say
succinctly
now
that
we
think
at
the
price
working
men
and
women
of
the
right
to
form
their
own
organizations
and
that
that
is
a
deprivation
of
their
freedom
of
assembly
set
forth
in
the
first
amendment.
now,
if
the
court
please,
a
brief
analysis
of
the
statutory
text
what
i
believe
suffice
to
show
that
interpretation
given
it
by
the
court
below
was
not
the
only
possible
interpretation.
what
the
court
did
was
in
effect
hold
that
the
word
vote
in
the
phrase
majority
vote
of
the
delegates
voting,
modifies
--
i'm
sorry,
the
word
majority,
modifies
both
the
word
vote
and
the
word
delegates.
now
it
seems
perfectly
clear
that
loading
the
word
majority
with
that
dual
function
eliminates
any
function
for
the
word
vote.
a
congressional
design
to
have
a
majority
of
the
delegates
voting
determine
the
issue
would've
been
more
precisely
and
lucidly
communicated
by
simply
saying
a
majority
of
the
delegates
voting.
on
the
other
hand,
our
interpretation
gives
full
meaning
to
each
word
utilized
by
the
congress.
the
congress
declared
that
only
delegates
at
a
convention
may
act
on
this
issue.
and
the
congress
said
that
when
they
act,
when
they
cast
their
ballots,
a
majority
of
those
ballots
must
be
in
favor
of
raising
dues
in
order
to
lawfully
effectuate
the
increase.
whether
a
delegate
passed
one
vote
or
more,
it
is
still
a
vote
of
the
delegates.
and
whether
as
in
most
instances
he
cast
more
than
one
vote
or
as
on
some,
he
cast
one,
there
is
still
the
necessity
of
a
majority
and
that
can
be
ascertained.
no
one
has
suggested
and
the
statute
is
perfectly
clear
on
this
fact,
that
unions
may
not
devise
their
own
representational
formula.
that
is
to
say,
they
could
fix
the
number
of
delegates
from
any
local
that
they
think
wise.
now,
we
say
that
congress
left
to
the
unions
the
power
to
decide
the
weight
of
the
vote
no
less
than
they
left
to
the
unions
the
power
to
decide
how
many
delegates
will
be
present.
and
our
underlying
thesis
if
the
court
please,
is
that
the
congress
fully
sensible
to
the
basic
democratic
values
inherent
and
the
ancient
principle
of
noninterference
with
the
internal
affairs
of
nonprofit
association
regulated
those
internal
affairs
most
reluctantly
and
only
to
the
extent
that
it
found
undemocratic
practices
that
had
been
clearly
established
as
having
been
abused.
now
the
legislative
history
of
this
section
shows
completely,
we
think,
the
legitimacy
of
our
interpretation.
the
senate
passed
its
bill,
s.
155
in
april
of
1959.
that
bill
made
it
clear
that
any
kind
of
a
majority
would
suffice
to
raise
dues.
that
bill
however
did
not
provide
for
referendum
votes
to
raise
dues.
they
did
not
provide
for
the
executive
board
or
similar
governing
body
of
a
union
to
raise
dues,
and
that
bill
also
regulated
decreases
in
dues.
upon
its
passage,
s.
155
became
the
focal
point
of
consideration
by
the
congress.
and
many
witnesses
appeared
before
the
congress
including
most
notably
the
president
of
the
afl-cio,
president
george
meany.
mr.
meany
appeared
before
a
joint
committee,
a
subcommittee
of
the
house,
and
criticized
the
bill
as
being
too
restrictive.
he
pointed
out
that
the
senate
bill
did
not
provide
for
referendum
and
quickly
added
that
in
his
view
that
was
an
unintended
omission.
that
in
point
of
fact
he
thought
and
i
think
i'd
quote
him,
“that
the
congress
was
prepared
to
permit
any
changes
in
dues
which
by
any
method
which
unions
generally
employ
except
the
method
of
a
change
by
the
executive
board
or
similar
body”.
now
we
say
to
you,
your
honors,
and
he
also
pointed
out
the
excess
of
trying
to
regulate
a
decrease
in
dues.
what
the
house
did
following
the
meany
testimony
shows
conclusively
that
the
congress
intended
to
enlarge
upon
the
original
senate
bill
which
permitted
any
majority
and
to
preserve
all
of
the
methods
that
unions
had
historically
used
to
raise
dues.
following
his
testimony,
three
major
bills
were
presented,
the
committee
bill,
the
landrum-griffin
bill
which
was
supported
by
--
by
management
and
the
shelly
bill
which
was
supported
by
labor.
now
all
of
these
bills
proposed
precisely
the
language
now
present
in
the
statute.
all
of
them
put
in
to
that
statute
the
right
to
raise
dues
by
referendum.
all
of
them
eliminated
the
regulation
of
a
decrease
in
dues,
and
most
significantly
all
of
them
granted
president
meany's
request
to
allow
a
raise
in
dues
by
the
executive
board
or
similar
governing
body.
we
think
it
unbelievable
that
the
congress
was
thus
so
completely
respond
to
president
meany's
request
and
suggestions
while
at
the
same
time,
sub
silentio,
outlawing
the
practices
of
over
a
majority
of
president
meany's
constituents.
if
the
court
please,
we're
here
on
summary
docket
and
my
time
runs
short.
i
want
to
preserve
as
much
time
as
possible
for
rebuttal.
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
inconsistency
between
the
interpretation
below
and
the
concern
that
congress
showed
for
equal
rights
of
members
in
the
very
same
title
in
section
101
(a)
(1).
the
inconsistency
between
that
interpretation
and
the
very
--
i'm
sorry,
and
the
universally
conceded
right
of
members
to
elect
officers
by
weighted-voting,
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
the
election
of
officers
was
the
major
thrust
of
internal
regulation
of
unions,
was
the
major
subject
of
abuses
found
by
the
mcclellan
committee
is
a
subject
of
elaborate
regulation
in
title
4
of
the
act,
was
the
subject
of
similar
regulation
in
the
pretest
of
kennedy-ives
bill.
it
was
the
articulated
concern
of
president
eisenhower,
of
secretary
of
labor
mitchell.
they
all
spoke
of
elections
of
officers
and
nobody
virtually
mentioned
this
problem
of
dues
until
the
last
moment.
i
say
the
inconsistency
between
this
interpretation
of
the
court
below
and
what
the
congress
did
on
a
matter
that
was
clearly
the
subject
of
abuse.
and
finally,
the
clear
repugnance
of
that
interpretation
with
the
declared
and
obvious
democratic
ideals
of
the
statute,
we
leave
these
arguments
to
our
brief,
but
we
think
they
all
show
most
compellingly
that
the
decision
below
is
erroneous.
one
final
word
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
i'm
sorry
i
do
not
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
yes.
mr.
henry
kaiser
there
was
virtually
no
discussion
your
honor.
mr.
henry
kaiser
it
was
mentioned
when
senator
mcclellan
introduced
his
first
bill,
s.
1137,
which
incidentally
provided
that
the
only
method
that
unions
can
use
at
conventions
was
that
of
voting
the
membership
of
the
constituents.
senator
mcclellan
made
one
observation
and
his
bill
also
regulated
the
size
of
the
initiation
fee.
he
said
that
he
was
against
high
initiation
fees.
now,
curiously
and
persuasively
enough,
the
only
abuses
found
in
this
entire
area
of
union
action
that
were
reported
by
the
senate
mcclellan
investigating
committee
stemmed
from
practices
precisely
which
can
flourish
on
the
interpretation
below
and
cannot
exist
under
the
method
used
by
the
federation.
these
were
instances
of
creating
ghost
locals
where
you
have
a
delegate
with
a
vote
but
no
membership.
mr.
henry
kaiser
that
is
right.
i
might
add,
if
the
court
please,
that
in
april
of
this
year
when
you
announce
your
decision
in
labor
board
versus
fruit
packers,
you
had
the
statute
which
concededly
under
its
literal
language
would've
required
the
finding
of
a
violation
of
the
act
by
product
picket,
consumer
picket.
nevertheless,
you
thought
it
was
“specially
significant”
that
none
of
the
sponsors
of
the
bill
had
indicated
that
such
picketing
was
an
abuse.
and
you
relied
elaborately
on
the
fact
that
the
congress
had
not
in
the
past
regulated
peaceful
picketing
except
in
insolated
instances
of
demonstrated
abuse.
now
let
me
say
to
your
honors
that
i
know
of
no
form
or
regulation
of
the
internal
affairs
of
unions
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
or
indeed
by
any
other
legislative
body.
this
was,
i
repeat,
done
most
reluctantly.
there
was
no
demonstration
of
abuses
in
this
whole
area
unless
demonstration
of
any
abuse
with
respect
to
weighted-voting.
and
i
should
like
to
preserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
henry
kaiser
if
the
court
please,
we
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
apologize
for
the
fact
that
there
are
only
20
musicians
in
waupaca,
wisconsin
and
that
we
extend
to
them
the
benefits
of
unionism.
nor
do
we
quite
see
the
relevance
of
the
that
to
anything
in
this
case.
in
reply
to
a
question
put
by
mr.
justice
white
as
to
whether
the
court
below's
decision
was
premised
on
the
so-called
facts,
counsel
was
honest
enough
to
say
that
it
did
not.
but
in
his
brief,
on
at
least
four
different
occasions,
he
made
statements
like
this
and
i
quote
from
page
21
in
the
brief.
the
decision
below,
he
says,
"only
forbids
the
use
of
roll
call
votes,
when
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
dues
increases
are
involved."
now
that's
a
grotesque
distortion
of
what
the
opinion
below
held.
judge
medina
made
an
elaborate
but
obviously
futile
effort
to
clear
the
air
so
as
to
lay
aside
what
he
properly
called,
“confusing
irrelevancies
and
diversions.”
if
the
court
please,
nothing
could
be
clearer
but
that
the
only
issue
discussed
below
and
decided
below
both
by
the
majority
and
the
minority
was
the
applicability
of
the
plain
meaning
rule.
now,
respondent's
total
failure,
indeed
he
concedes
here,
that
the
language
is
not
quite
so
plain.
instead
he
devotes
almost
all
of
his
brief
to
describing
what
he
considers
the
very,
very
sinister
circumstances
of
this
case.
and
if
the
court
please,
and
i
must
say
this,
he
has
resorted
throughout
this
litigation
to
the
most
scandalous
kind
of
slander,
relying
upon
the
familiar
but
discredited
technique
that
repetition
of
an
irrelevancy
or
of
an
untruthful
somehow
established
its
pertinence
or
its
truth.
he
has
said
in
his
brief
--
mr.
henry
kaiser
oh,
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
you're
right.
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
none
of
these
things
to
which
he
adverts
the
so-called
handpicking
of
delegates,
the
so-called
lack
of
notice,
the
so-called
late
night
manipulations.
none
of
them
were
found
by
any
court
below,
by
the
trial
court,
they
all
appear
only
in
the
complaint
which
in
this
case
was
verified
by
counsel
and
in
the
affidavit
of
counsel
who
was
not
present
at
the
convention.
they
were
all
disputed
by
persons
having
direct
knowledge
of
the
facts,
but
in
any
case
they're
not
before
this
court.
we
are
here,
if
the
court
please
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
on
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit.
we
are
not
appealing
from
mr.
schmidt's
complaint
or
indeed
from
his
very
resplendent
imagination
of
what
occurred
at
that
convention.
the
sole
issue
is
whether
congress
intended
this
result.
that's
the
only
issue
before
this
court
and
we
say
that
consistent
with
its
language,
with
its
statutory
history,
with
other
provisions
of
the
act
and
with
its
declared
policy
there
can
only
be
one
result
that
congress
did
successfully
safeguard
all
existing
methods
for
raising
dues
at
union
conventions.
thank
you.
