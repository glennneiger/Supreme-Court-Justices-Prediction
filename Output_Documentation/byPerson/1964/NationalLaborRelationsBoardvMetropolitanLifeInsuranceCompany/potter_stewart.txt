there
are
eight
district
offices
in
the
state
of
rhode
island?
justice
potter
stewart
and
rhode
island
is
a
pretty
small
state
of

justice

stewart
how
--
how
far
a
product
of
woon
--
this
is
woonsocket?

12
miles
away.
justice

there's
no
issue
with
the
other
cases.
it
seems
to
be
a
unit
with
five
dots,
in
other
words
obviously
at
least
some
indication
that's
the
only
organization.
justice
potter
stewart
because
in
that
organization
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
(inaudible)
rather
large
in
each
of
the
other
states.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
while
you're
doing
it
give
us
one
of
these
cases,
this
other
cases
where
you've
ever
bearing
in
this
organization
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
narrower
or
broader
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
real
question
is
whether
or
not
the
board
let
the
extent
of
organization
be
the
determining
factor,
the
controlling
factor
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
the
question?
justice
potter
stewart
well
mr.
friedman,
you
say
the
board
has
decided
that
this
is
--
that
the
single
offices
inherently,
inherently
inappropriate
unit.
i
suppose
the
administrative
agents
is
going
to
stop
there
with
those
federal
agents,
should
they
claim
some
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
it
didn't
in
this
case,
did
they?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
means
--
that
means
that
just
inherently
this
way
no
matter
what
state
it's
located
in,
no
matter
what
district
office
that's
in
--
that
is
involved
with
a
particular
case
just
inherently
a
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
so
it's
a
big
unit?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
if
it
--
if
it
isn't
an
adequate
word
then
i
would
think
that
in
any
particular
case
especially
in
view
of
the
series
of
cases
that
board
has
had
that
--
that
the
board
ought
to
explain
why
the
difference
between
this
case
in
some
other
case
where
a
multimember
multidistrict
unit
has
been
--
has
been
proved
or
why
in
this
case
the
district
office
12
miles
away
shouldn't
be
included
in
the
unit?
justice
potter
stewart
other
than
that,
i
mean
it
inherently
doesn't
carry
that
kind
of
phrase.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
if
you
--
do
you
think
that
means
everywhere
now?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
tell
me
that
if
a
--
say
that
you've
got
a
--
you've
got
a
case
where
this
--
they
--
they
go
through
this
routine
and
say
that
a
single
office,
a
single
district
office
is
the
appropriate
units
inherently
this
way
and
in
the
next
case
i
guess
the
unions
organized
two
offices
and
so
they
say
well
so
as
a
--
so
was
our
--
the
two
district
units,
the
--
that's
appropriate
too.
but
the
only
difference
between
the
two
cases
happens
to
be
the
extent
of
organization?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
different
names
of
the
district
offices
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
different
states
--
justice
potter
stewart
did
anyone
ever
explained
what
that
is,
other
than
inherently?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
inherent
is
coherent?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
in
chicago,
you
had
them
127
miles
apart.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
far
was
it?
