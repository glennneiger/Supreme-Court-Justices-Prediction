mr.
burton
a.
zorn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
discussion
up
to
this
point
would
lead
to
this
comment
as
to
the
nature
of
the
question
presented
here
for
review.
i
believe
that
in
this
case
particularly
when
we're
dealing
with
the
statute
of
this
nature
which
prohibits
certain
kinds
of
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
board
it
is
perfectly
obvious
that
the
board
if
it
should
ever
violate
the
statute
would
never
say
so.
and
my
friend
has
been
arguing
constantly
that
this
court
should
in
effect
be
bound
by
what
the
board
said
in
justification
of
its
decisions
both
with
respect
to
what
it
calls
a
single
administrative
entity
and
with
respect
to
the
other
doctrine
of
geographic
coherence.
i
submit
that
on
the
record
of
these
cases
where
in
every
single
interest
--
every
single
instance
and
every
case
involving
this
company
the
board
has
found
appropriate
a
unit
which
is
precisely
the
unit
which
has
been
asked
for
by
the
union
and
exactly
coextensive
with
the
extent
of
union's
--
the
union's
organization
at
that
time
this
court
will
very
properly
look
at
the
results
of
what
the
board
has
actually
done
and
not
be
bound
by
certain
assertions
made
by
the
board.
now,
with
respect
to
the
assertions
here,
i
think
we
can
get
those
very
quickly.
mr.
friedman
argues
that
all
the
board
did
in
these
cases
was
to
apply
settled
established
principles
of
the
board.
we
say
that
we
can
demonstrate
very
shortly
that
that
is
absolutely
not
the
fact,
it
is
not
so.
he
says
further
that
the
board
applied
its
doctrine
coherently.
a
quick
review
of
the
facts
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment
will
demonstrate
the
most
irrational
kind
of
diversity
with
respect
to
all
of
the
units
found
by
this
board
tailored
to
fit
the
union's
request
and
the
only
constant
fact
to
your
honors
which
appears
throughout
everyone
of
these
cases
and
there
is
only
one
single
factor
which
is
constant
or
the
common
denominator
for
all
and
that
is
the
union's
request
and
the
limited
extent
to
which
the
union
has
organized
the
employees
at
that
particular
time
when
its
request
is
made.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
i
don't
think
so
because
i
will
come
in
a
moment
--
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
yes.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
may
i
come
to
that
in
a
moment,
because
this
administrative
entity
--
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
that's
this
case
but
this
case
has
another
factor
in
it,
your
honor.
this
case
also
has
in
it
if
the
factor
that
the
board
rejected
the
company's
request
for
the
inclusion
of
seven
other
offices
which
the
union
had
sought
unsuccessfully
to
organize
all
or
which
were
located
in
the
metropolitan
area
of
providence,
rhode
island
and
it
rejected
that
because
the
nearest
office
was
12
miles
away.
when
i
come
to
review
the
facts
very
briefly,
the
fact
is
that
the
farthest
office
was
only
24
miles
away
when
in
fact
in
other
cases
in
adopting
its
so-called
metropolitan
area
concept
flowing
from
its
geographic
coherence
doctrine,
the
board
included
units
which
were
30
miles
away,
offices
which
are
--
and
detached
offices
and
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
moment
which
are
as
far
as
284
miles
away
and
of
course
when
we
get
to
chicago
that
is
the
most
revealing
of
the
consistency
of
the
board.
it
shows
so
plainly
how
the
board
jumped
from
failure
to
post
in
order
to
accommodate
the
extent
of
union
of
organizations.
now,
i
don't
want
to
get
into
the
facts
nor
do
i
have
time
to
get
into
the
facts
with
respect
to
the
organization
and
the
operation
of
a
company
and
its
administrative
subdivisions.
all
i
think
i
need
to
point
out
here
your
honor
is
this,
in
every
case
despite
the
argument
of
my
friend
where
every
single
factor
with
respect
to
the
administration
of
the
company,
its
operation
and
its
control
was
absolutely
identical
with
the
facts
upon
which
the
board
has
ruled
in
these
cases.
the
board
over
the
years
has
repeatedly
and
uniformly
held
that
these
single
district
office
units
and
citywide
units
were
completely
inappropriate
except
on
the
basis
of
the
limited
extent
of
the
union's
organization
and
if
your
honors
will
look
at
page
16
of
my
brief
but
i
will
not
quote
from,
you
will
see
contrary
to
what
my
friend
has
said
that
the
only
way
those
cases
can
possibly
be
read
is
to
be
read
when
the
word
--
board
uses
the
word
‘solely'
on
the
basis
of
extent
of
organization
controllingly
on
the
basis
of
extent
of
organization.
the
board
had
all
of
these
criteria
well
developed
at
the
time
it
was
deciding
these
cases
and
yet
in
every
single
one
of
them
before
they
adopted
the
statewide
rule
in
1944
it
held
unequivocally
that
the
only
possible
basis
on
the
basis
of
board
test
for
establishing
such
units
that
was
the
extent
of
organization
and
as
recently
as
1959
one
of
the
board
members
who
constitutes
the
present
majority
of
this
board
member,
fanning.
in
the
light
of
virginia
case
who
disagreed
with
its
colleagues
and
that
he
wanted
the
statewide
rule
which
had
been
established
in
1944
set-aside.
mr.
fanning
analyzed
the
basic
criteria
or
standards
of
the
board
to
be
applied
in
unit
cases
and
he
found
in
that
case
as
recently
as
1959
that
a
single
district
office
couldn't
conceivably
fit
within
any
of
--
it
couldn't
qualify
rather
within
any
of
the
normal
criteria
of
the
board
and
i
think
the
asset
test
here
is
really
what
made
a
single
district
office
inappropriate
in
the
earlier
and
what
factor
has
so
changed
as
to
make
it
appropriate
today.
now
the
board's
entire
argument
rests
on
the
assertion
of
two
criteria.
one
is
the
criteria
of
the
administrative
entity
which
is
inherently
appropriate
for
collective
bargaining.
now,
a
member,
fanning
in
1959
took
the
board's
administrative
division
test
which
is
a
normal
test
which
the
board
has
applied
for
many
years
and
he
said,
the
administrative
structure
as
the
board
has
used
that
term
in
every
case
over
the
years
until
this
case.
the
administrative
structure
is
a
grouping
of
a
company's
administrative
operation
which
consists
in
turn
of
a
group
of
many
small
units
and
where
the
effect
of
authority
and
control
is
vested
in
this
administrative
division
like
the
territorial
divisions
in
this
case.
never
has
this
board
defined
administrative
entity
or
administrative
structure
and
it's
a
criterion
which
is
used
repeatedly
over
the
years
to
apply
to
one
of
a
group
of
small
units
within
a
larger
unit.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
i'll
be
glad
to
answer
that
question
now
mr.
justice
goldberg
--
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
our
--
our
problem
here
of
course
is
not
that
problem.
our
problem
here
is
to
determine
whether
the
union
violates
or
whether
the
board
has
violated
section
9
(c)
(5).
we
have
contended
before
the
board
that
in
our
view,
in
the
insurance
industry,
the
three
possible
appropriate
units
by
reasons
of
the
very
peculiar
nature
of
this
industry
which
is
totally
different
in
its
operations
than
any
other
would
be
the
statewide
unit
which
is
justified
not
on
the
extent
of
organization
but
on
the
board's
own
decisions
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
every
insurance
company
including
this
company
is
very
strictly
regulated
on
a
state
by
state
basis,
its
agents
are
licensed
on
a
state
by
state
basis
and
in
earlier
cases
years
ago
before
the
board
adopted
the
statewide
rule
as
such.
it
did
find
state
units
appropriate
on
the
basis
of
state
regulation
more
than
that.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
well,
if
the
board
had
adopted
a
criterion
of
the
method
of
regulation
of
an
industry
it
might
have
been
a
fair
criterion,
i
don't
know
but
beyond
that
mr.
justice
goldberg
i
think
another
criteria
in
which
it
might
well
apply
to
the
state
unit
and
applies
in
this
case
is
that
there
has
been
both
in
this
industry
and
there
has
been
in
this
company
successful
history
of
collective
bargaining
on
a
state
by
state
basis
and
history
of
bargaining
as
you
well
know
of
course
is
a
factor
of
some
importance.
so
i
say
a
approximate
extent
of
organization,
a
statewide
unit
might
be
appropriate.
obviously,
a
territorial
wide
unit
conforming
to
the
real
supervision
and
control
because
what
has
been
said
here
about
the
extent
of
authority
of
a
manager
is
minuscule
already
it
is.
if
you
look
at
this
record
you'll
see
there's
nothing
to
it.
that,
a
territorial
unit
i
think
would
be
appropriate
and
obviously
a
companywide
unit
is
appropriate
and
the
two
major
competitors
of
this
company
do
bargain
on
a
companywide
basis.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
it
would
--
that
the
territory
of
unit
which
would
apply
in
this
particular
case
in
new
england
would
be
the
territory
which
includes
all
of
the
states
in
new
england.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
i
--
without
looking
at
the
record
i
can't
tell
you
how
many
officers,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honor
this
board
didn't
have
to
meet
the
company's
contention
in
this
case
because
in
all
the
other
--
in
many
of
the
other
cases
it
was
applying
a
metropolitan
area
concept
based
on
this
geographic
appearance
theory
and
all
of
the
officers
in
rhode
island
were
located
within
the
metropolitan
providence
area.
now,
had
they
--
now,
it's
conceivable,
justice
goldberg,
that
on
the
appropriate
record
a
metropolitan
grouping
of
district
offices
could
be
found
to
be
appropriate
because
at
least
there
the
board
has
and
we're
now
talking
about
established
and
settled
criteria
on
which
the
board
rest
its
case
here
because
there
the
board
over
the
years
has
grouped
in
a
retail
industry
has
grouped
a
series
of
stores
on
a
metropolitan
basis
on
the
theory
of
economic
integration
on
the
community
and
so
on
that
might
be
an
inappropriate.
might
be,
i'm
not
saying
it
would
but
those
are
the
kind
of
units
that
might
be
appropriate.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
it
never
has
until
this
started
with
the
quaker
city
case
in
1961,
i
think
december
1961.
this
case
is
a
1962
case.
late
in
december
of
1962
or
september
of
1962,
the
board
then
proceeded
to
apply
to
reverse
its
policies
in
the
retail
food
chain
industry
and
then
to
sav-on-drugs
case
held,
they
didn't
used
the
term
separate
administrative
entity
which
is
essentially
a
verbalism
could
cover
anything.
they
said
there
in
effect
that
they
wanted
to
change
their
policy
to
make
it
easier
for
store
employees
to
organize
and
therefore,
they
held
for
the
first
time
that
a
single
retail
store
was
appropriate
but
that
came
after
a
series
of
these
cases.
and
very
recently
they've
gone
a
step
further
and
carved
contrary
to
their
own
rules
in
the
recent
--
the
department
store
case,
allied
stores
case
contrary
to
the
set
of
rule
that
a
store
or
department
storewide
unit
except
for
possible
prepped
carvings,
the
department
storewide
unit
could
now
be
separated
into
selling,
none
selling
and
restaurant
with
the
same
union
petitioning
for
three
separate
unit.
so,
the
board
has
been
moving
in
change
of
policy
very
rapidly
in
this
overall
area.
i'd
like
to
get
back
for
a
moment,
if
i
may,
just
to
some
of
the
facts
here
which
i
think
are
sufficiently
startling
that
i
think
they
will
convince
this
court
that
regardless
of
what
the
board
has
said
here.
it
was
not
applying
its
criteria
consistently
nor
was
it
applying
an
established
or
settled
criteria
because
in
this
case
as
i've
pointed
out
the
seven
other
officers
were
excluded.
this
case,
however,
happened
to
be
the
fifth
in
the
series
of
metropolitan
cases.
the
first
involved
cleveland.
in
cleveland
the
board
said,
that
is
the
board
majority
because
there
were
two
member
dissents
running
through
all
of
these
cases
and
the
dissents
were
based
on
proposition
that
in
the
view
of
the
expert
two
board
members
the
board
was
following
the
extent
of
organization
--
that
extent
of
organization
was
controlling.
but
in
cleveland
adopting
first
this
so
called
administrative
entity
inherently
appropriate
doctrine
which
is
never
used
before
and
which
equally
could've
--
we
applied
to
divide
a
department
store
not
into
three
divisions
but
in
a
several
hundred
separate
departments.
the
board
said
“first,
this
is
a
separate
administrative
entity;
second,
because
of
cogent
geographically
reasons
we
will
include
all
because
the
union
asked
for
it,
we
will
include
the
officers
in
the
city
and
the
officers
in
the
suburbs
in
one
unit
even
though
there
the
distance
was
18
miles.”
the
next
case
was
the
wilmington
case
where
they
combined
the
two
in
the
metropolitan
area
of
wilmington
on
the
same
theory
and
rejected
the
company's
request
for
the
inclusion
of
the
dover
office
46
miles
away.
mr.
friedman
says
the
board
never
would've
included
it
even
if
the
union
had
requested
it.
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
it
would
not
have.
the
third
was
the
sioux
city
case.
let
me
say
a
word
about
detached
offices,
in
sioux
city,
detached
offices
were
in
two
different
states,
north
dakota
and
south
dakota,
the
district
office
was
in
sioux
city
island.
in
that
case
the
board
included
all
of
them.
now,
a
detached
office
on
the
reasoning
of
the
board
that
the
manager
of
a
district
office
is
the
immediate
supervisory
authority
over
the
employees,
that
applies
equally
to
a
detached
office
case
because
with
this
distances
apart
it
is
the
assistant
manager
who
is
the
immediate
supervisory
authority
and
the
record
discloses
that
this
virtually
know,
alright,
the
most
only
some
occasional
contact
between
the
district
office
and
the
detached
office
and
far
more
contract
--
contact
as
a
matter
of
fact
from
the
super
intent
of
agency
and
his
assistance
than
there
ever
is,
with
the
manager.
in
any
event
the
fifth
of
them
was
this
case,
but
then
we
came
to
chicago
and
that
i
think
as
i
said
is
the
most
revealing
of
all.
here,
the
board
on
this
geographic
coherence
test
has
adopted
what
the
regional
director
in
chicago
thought
was
a
test
that
you
want
to
follow.
the
union
petitions
only
for
the
offices
in
the
city
within
the
political
city
limits
of
chicago.
the
regional
director
following
what
he
thinks
the
board
has
said
includes
not
only
the
offices
in
the
city
of
chicago
but
the
suburban
offices.
there
were
33
of
them
in
the
city
and
14
in
the
suburb.
but
“no”
says
the
board
when
a
case
comes
before
it.
we
are
going
to
exclude
all
of
the
suburban
offices
and
we're
going
to
exclude
them
for
the
following
reason.
that
upon
the
physical
location
of
the
individual
offices
as
the
yardstick
in
determining
the
appropriate
geographic
appropriateness
of
the
unit
when
in
fact
six
of
the
city
office
had
territories
extending
in
those
suburbs,
three
of
the
suburban
offices
had
territories
extending
into
the
city
and
there
was
no
more
than
a
distance
of
six
blocks
between
one
city
office
and
one
suburban
office.
so,
the
metropolitan
union
cons
--
metropolitan
area
concept
goes
out
of
the
window
and
what
this
concept
are
physical
yardstick
can
possibly
mean
i
leave
to
your
honors'
imagination.
following
that
without
going
in
anymore
detail
that's
all
covered
in
our
brief,
i
want
to
say
that
in
22
of
the
other
cases
in
which
the
board
has
--
has
held
appropriately
a
single
district
office
in
at
least
ten
of
them
the
distance
between
the
office
certified
and
the
nearest
office
was
less
than
five
miles,
in
some
cases
only
one
or
two
miles.
now,
i
need
to
spend
very
little
time
and
i
don't
know
how
much
time
i
do
have
left
on
the
question
of
the
statute
itself.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
plain,
it
was
intended
to
reverse
a
practice
which
the
board
had
engaged
in,
in
this
industry
and
other
industries
of
forming
units
based
on
the
extent
of
organization.
now,
whether
you
argue
that
it
sole
or
controlling
i
think
our
brief
covers
that
sufficiently
and
i
think
for
purposes
of
this
case
it
makes
very
little
difference
because
our
position
here
is
that
the
test
which
the
board
claims
to
have
set
up
first
with
respect
to
this
that
single
administrative
entity
are
not
valid
test
nor
are
they
test
which
the
board
has
ever
applied
before
and
never
in
any
situation
applied
before
and
when
it
comes
to
the
application
of
those
test
and
the
geographic
coherence
test
i
think
you'd
arrive
at
one
simple
conclusion
that
you
can't
possibly
explain
this
irrationality
and
inconsistency
of
decision
except
on
the
basic
ground
of
the
one
factor
which
is
common
and
constant
through
all
of
these
cases
and
that
is
the
factor
of
the
extent
to
which
the
union
has
organized
at
that
particular
time.
yes,
justice
black?
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
i
understand
the
statute
--
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
to
say
that
in
determining
any
unit,
the
board
shall
not
give,
i'm
paraphrasing
your
honor,
but
i
think
this
is
appropriate,
shall
not
give
the
union's
extent
organization
or
the
extent
to
which
the
employees
have
been
organized
controlling
weight
in
any
unit
determinations.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
it
is
95,
yes
--
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
no,
the
supreme
test
on
this
case,
if
i
may
disagree
--
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
the
effectuation
of
self
organization,
yes.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
well,
but
that
general
purpose
was
limited
by
the
enactment
of
9
(c)
(5)
to
stop
the
board
from
doing
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
that's
clear,
i
think.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
that's
clearly
right.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
no,
i
have
not
made
that
argument.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
i'm
sorry
i've
failed
but
may
i
summarize
it
to
answer
your
question?
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
may
i
try?
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
we
have
not
said
that
the
extent
of
organization
is
entitled
to
no
weight
whatsoever.
it's
entitled
to
some
weight
but
it
cannot
be
the
basis
or
the
controlling
factor
in
the
decision,
this
is
what
the
statute
said.
now,
how
do
we
arrive
at
the
question
as
to
whether
the
statute
was
right?
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
yes
sir.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
and
the
proof
consists
of
two
separate
bases.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
but
the
proof
consists
of
two
pieces
and
we
meet
the
government
ahead
on.
the
proof
is
that
the
board
is
--
the
board
must
in
defending
this
choice
he
limited
to
the
grounds,
get
itself
involved.
this
is
a
settled
doctrine
in
this
court
(voice
overlap)
so
we
say
--
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
this
is
what
this
court
has
decided
many
times,
your
honor,
unless
they
want
to
change,
its
fine.
(voice
overlap)
the
basis
on
which
an
administrative
agency
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
--
makes
the
decision
shall
be
tested
on
the
basis
of
the
reasons
asserted
by
the
agency.
now,
if
i'm
wrong
about
that,
i'm
wrong
about
a
certain
city
but
i
just
like
to
say
these
two
things.
we
say
that
judicial
review
to
determine
whether
or
not
extent
of
organization
has
in
fact
and
in
truth
and
the
controlling
factor
in
this
decision
and
the
other
decisions
is
supported
by
two
basic
propositions.
first,
that
the
criteria
or
the
standards
of
principles
announced
by
the
board
are
inconsistent
with
standards
which
they
have
announced
over
the
past
and
second,
that
when
you
get
a
formula
of
geographic
coherence
and
it
is
applied
with
such
inconsistency
that
it
makes
utterly
no
sense
then
you
must
look
behind
that
to
find
out
what
the
board
has
done,
that's
my
position
in
and
of
itself.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
well,
i
--
i
don't
say,
don't
misunderstand
me
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
i
don't
say
sir
that
the
board
has
no
authority
ever
to
change
a
policy
of
a
rule
but
i
do
say
that
with
the
existence
of
section
9
(c)
(5)
if
it
when
it
does
that,
that
that
change
of
policy
should
be
carefully
scrutinized
to
determine
what
its
purpose
was
and
i
say
further
that
in
this
case,
the
board
has
found
what
it
has
said
in
this
case
and
that
is
that
mistakenly
or
otherwise.
it
thought
it
was
applying
its
normal
criteria
which
in
fact
it
was.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
yes
sir.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
you
can
disregard
my
comment
entirely,
mr.
justice
black,
and
i
think
you
would
come
out
with
the
same
result
because
all
you
need
to
do
is
look
at
the
visible
results
of
what
the
board
has
done
in
these
cases
to
arrive
at
your
own
conclusion
of
what
it
did.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
no,
i
would
not.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
i
would
--
i
would
answer
you
two
ways,
i
would
say
first
of
all,
you
would
first
have
to
determine
because
you
see
i
haven't
made
this
argument
here
because
i
think
it's
unnecessary.
but
you
could
make
the
argument
based
on
this
court's
decisions
in
many
administrative
cases
that
what
--
when
the
board
acts
inconsistently
and
irrationally
in
certain
cases
it
may
be
guilty
of
such
arbitrary
conduct
that
even
with
this
broad
discussion
and
apart
from
section
9
(c)
(5)
this
court
could
reverse.
i
haven't
made
that
argument
simply
because
i
think
it's
unnecessary
but
i
think
it
applies
here.
but
in
your
case,
i
think
you
got
to
look
at
the
facts
of
the
group
of
cases
because
how
else
under
this
statute
could
you
ever
possibly
show
what
the
board
has
done?
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
well,
i'd
say
--
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
yes.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
no,
but
i
say
further
that
there
was
in
this
case
a
request
by
the
company
for
inclusion
of
the
other
seven
offices
in
metropolitan
providence
and
i
say
that
since
that
was
rejected
you
can't
decide
this
case
alone
on
whether
this
administrative
entity
inherent
theory
is
a
proper
test
or
not.
you've
got
to
decide
also
whether
the
board
was
--
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
whether
the
board
was
consistent
and
rejecting
offices
in
the
metropolitan
area
of
providence
much
closer
to
get
than
offices
was
taken
by
in
another
city.
i
mean
you
cant
--
it's
--
it's
on
both
grounds.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
you're
entirely
right
mr.
justice
black
in
thinking
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
--
of
the
organization
of
employees
is
one
of
the
basic
policies
they
had
but
that
we
don't
argue.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
well,
the
act
is
not
--
but
the
board
has
frequently
over
the
years
following
the
statutory
purpose,
when
it
has
found
a
company
request
to
be
proper
and
the
union
request
to
be
improper
granted
a
company
(voice
overlap).
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
it
should
be
--
it's
that's
their
way
to
apply,
they
should
apply
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
of
course
it
can
and
that
has
to
be
--
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
it's
not
really
--
not
really
a
matter
of
convenience
mr.
justice
black.
what
the
board
has
done
repeatedly
over
the
years
is
to
weigh
the
two
positions
of
the
parties
of
the
employer
and
the
union
and
this
has
gone
back
since
the
beginning
of
the
board
and
still
goes
on
today
and
determine
which
of
the
things
best
fits
within
the
test
which
the
board
has
established.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
not
quite
because
on
test
statute
--
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
the
test
of
the
statute
is
a
further
test
and
that
is
what
will
best
effectuate
collective
bargaining.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
that
is
quite
another
factor
and
what
the
congress
was
interested
when
this
act
was
passed
was
in
not
merely
in
giving
employees
freedom
of
organization
and
collective
bargaining
but
it
was
also
interested
in
preserving
industrial
piece
in
eliminating
industrial
strike.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
what
do
you
mean?
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
well,
it
does
have
in
it
when
i
thought
it
had
obviously
and
that
is
that
the
assurance
of
full
freedom
is
also
coupled
with
the
fact
that
these
rights
a
full
freedom
are
granted
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
and
the
board
in
every
case
makes
a
finding
that
whatever
unit
it
decides
is
appropriate
for
collective
bargaining
and
my
only
thought
on
your
question
is
simply
this,
that
the
board
has
a
right
and
a
duty.
not
only
to
consider
desires
of
employees
which
is
precisely
what
congress
outlaw
in
1947
that
it
also
has
a
duty
to
consider
which
unit
aside
from
the
desires
of
the
employees
is
a
unit
that
will
effectuate
successful
collective
bargaining
and
that
is
the
other
branch
of
its
obligation.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
i
not
only
read
the
section
this
way
but
i
read
--
in
over
the
years
i
have
made
many
--
many
of
the
decisions
and
that's
what
the
court
has
said.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
yes.
well,
the
general
section
with
respect
to,
the
board
as
the
court
has
never
passed
on
section
9
(c)
(5)
the
board
has
never
met
it
ahead
on.
i'm
talking
about
the
general
section
9
with
respect
to
the
discretion
of
the
board
in
finding
units
appropriate.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
right.
mr.
burton
a.
zorn
you
--
you
put
that
so
much
better
than
i
did
and
that
was
the
basis
of
the
decision
below
as
well.
thank
you.
