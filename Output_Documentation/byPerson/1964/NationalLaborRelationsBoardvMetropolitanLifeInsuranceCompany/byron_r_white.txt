what
precisely
reflected
in
what
the
factory
is
determined.

including
only
one
office.
justice
byron

white
and
the
next
office
is
12
miles
away?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
maybe
thought
if
you
only
have
rhode
island
to
look
at.
this
was
the
first
case
that
ever
happened.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you've
got
to
look
at
what
the
board
did
in
this
case,
don't
you,
in
connection
with
what
is
then
another
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
they
do
it
in
the
first
time,
this
place
has
ever
come
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
any
particular
case
is
always
consistent
with
the
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
--
a
lot
of
them
was
the
--
there
was
a
lot
of
factors,
but
how
about
the
whole
bunch
of
cases
together?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
by
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
all
of
the
cases
together
though
you
still
haven't
answer
my
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
can
look
at
every
case
on
its
own
merit
in
connection
with
all
of
the
other
cases
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
you
have
to
consider
the
other
cases
when
you
are
considering
one
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i'm
glad
you
are.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
want
us
to
stop
at
looking
at
the
result
in
each
of
the
other
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
district
offices
--
where
we
have
any
autonomy
in
labor
matters?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
whether
the
unit
was
statewide
for
the
district
or
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
has
to
be
companywide.
i
mean
there's
a
logical
conclusion.
for
them
its
companywide
bargaining?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
regions
or
whatever
they
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
suppose
you
could
win
all
your
other
cases
and
lose
this
one
--
justice
byron
r.
white
even
on
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
are
some
units
that's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
some
units
that
appropriated.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
that's
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
zorn
i
supposed
that
(voice
overlap)
and
if
your
position
is
that
if
you
did
have
a
case,
two
cases,
which
had
absolutely
similar
circumstances
other
than
the
extent
of
organization
that
the
board
couldn't
come
out
with
different
results
with
the
two
--
in
the
two
circumstances
which
means
--
let's
assume
that
there
were
two
district
offices
in
the
north
end
of
rhode
island
and
two
district
offices
in
the
south
end.
both
offices
were
organized
in
the
south
end
and
only
one
of
the
offices
in
the
north
end
and
as
far
and
both
of
them
were
12
miles
away
from
each
other
and
all
of
the
factors
you
would
think
would
indicate
to
be
the
same
result
in
both
of
them
except
that
--
but
the
board
comes
out
with
different
results
and
if
it
answers
you
correctly,
all
the
other
factors
were
equal
but
the
extent
of
organization
was
not.
now,
we're
permitted
to
give
some
weight,
some
weight.
in
this
case
it
happens
to
be
controlling
way.
you
would
say
that,
you
would
say
that
the
--
in
that
circumstance
you
couldn't
give
even
any
weight
to
the
extent
of
organization.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
you
would
say
that
board
could
come
out
with
different
results
in
those
positions?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
trouble
is
that
the
board
where
there's
great
mistake,
but
in
other
cases
or
not
does
not
deal
--
it
has
not
dealt
with
the
case
as
a
single
office
that
it's
concluded
to
single
office
and
it's
an
appropriate
unit
and
that
--
and
apparently
it
intends
to
hold
that
and
whatever
you
might
say
about
the
other
cases
what
about
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
this
one
what
if
it
says
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
it
says
i
think
these
are
--
this
is
an
appropriate
unit.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
citywide
base
--
that
the
statewide
basis
isn't
good?
