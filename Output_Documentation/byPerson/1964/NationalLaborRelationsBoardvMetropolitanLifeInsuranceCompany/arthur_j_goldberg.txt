mr.
friedman,
did
it
mean
it
is
something
underlying
and
that
is
a
sense
of
the
congress
that
the
board
in
decision-making
prior
to
that
time
is
following
a
practice
which
the
congress
did
not
approved?

is
that
all
that
the

facts
and

in
this
case?

first
to
another
case
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
mr.
friedman,
do
i
remember
correctly
the
fact
in
recordings

board
used
to
find
the
single
district
offices
inappropriate
but
would
come
to
the
sustain
them
on
the
extent
of
organization
doctrine?
justice
arthur
j.

then
there
was
this
change?

was
the
basis
for
that
case
which

that
the
district

in
the
city
of
iowa,
and
the

would
be
the
appropriate
unit?
justice
arthur
j.

do
you
think
that
every
time
that

justice
arthur
j.

but
state
regulation
has
nothing
to
do
with
industrial
relations
in
this

does
it?
justice

now
supposed

isn't
what
you
are
saying
is
that
the
