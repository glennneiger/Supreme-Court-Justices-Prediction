mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
is
here
under
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
brings
before
the
court
the
standards
which
the
national
labor
relations
board
follows
in
determining
what
is
an
appropriate
unit
for
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
by
insurance
agents.
more
specifically
the
question
is
whether
in
selecting
as
an
appropriate
unit
a
single
district
office
of
the
metropolitan
life
insurance
company
in
woonsocket,
rhode
island,
the
board
violated
section
9
(c)
(5)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
that
is
a
section
that
was
added
to
the
statute
in
1947
and
states
that
in
selecting
the
appropriate
unit
the
board
shall
not
treat
the
extent
to
which
the
employees
have
organized
as
controlling.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
held
that
the
board
in
selecting
this
unit
had
violated
that
standard,
not
as
we
read
the
opinion
because
it
was
anything
in
the
board's
decision
in
this
case
to
show
that
it
had
treated
the
extent
of
organization
as
controlling
but
because
of
the
fact
that
in
six
other
cases
also
involving
the
selection
of
appropriate
units
for
insurance
agents.
in
each
case,
the
unit
which
the
board
ultimately
selected
in
some
instances
a
single
district
office
and
other
instances
i
shall
explain
a
combination
of
offices.
in
each
case,
the
unit
which
the
board
selected
as
appropriate
was
the
same
unit
that
the
union
had
requested
and
the
court
of
appeals
stated
it
was
unable
to
reconcile
this
conflicting
decisions
of
the
board
and
it
therefore
drew
the
inference
that
in
all
of
these
cases
including
this
one,
the
thing
that
had
controlled
the
board's
selection
of
the
appropriate
unit
was
the
extent
of
organization.
now,
our
position
is
this,
we
think
we
can
show
and
i'll
attempt
to
show
that
in
selecting
this
particular
unit,
that
is
a
single
district
office,
the
board
applied
its
settled
principles
which
it
had
consistently
applied
in
various
fields
in
selecting
appropriate
units.
but
there
was
no
abuse
of
discretion
in
so
doing
that
its
various
decisions
dealing
with
insurance
agents
are
consistent
and
all
of
these
come
down
basically
to
the
question
of
statutory
interpretation
which
is
what
does
it
meant
when
--
if
the
congress
says
that
the
extent
of
organization
shall
not
be
controlling.
we
say
all
that
it
meant
was
that
the
board
could
not
base
its
decision
solely
on
the
fact
of
extent
of
organization
but
the
board
may
in
deciding
these
questions
consider
the
extent
of
organization.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
think
that's
right
mr.
justice
and
as
i
will
develop,
we
think
the
legislative
history
shows
that
despite
this
limitation
nevertheless
the
congress
did
recognized
that
the
board
could
select
small
units
if
they
were
appropriate
under
the
standard
criteria.
i'd
like
to
just
mention
before
coming
to
the
facts
that
this
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
first
circuit
is
contrary
to
the
decisions
of
three
other
circuits,
each
of
which
has
upheld
a
board
determination
of
this
appropriate
unit
on
the
same
basis
that
the
board
went
on
in
this
case.
now,
there's
no
basic
dispute
over
the
facts
in
this
case.
the
record
which
is
before
the
court
has
read
a
long
document
consist
primarily
of
the
record
in
another
case
involving
the
selection
of
appropriate
units
in
delaware
and
the
facts
developed
in
that
case
relate
to
the
general
operation
of
the
company
and
i
--
whereby
stipulation
included
in
the
record
in
this
case.
the
company
sells
insurance
throughout
the
united
states
and
canada.
its
operations
admittedly
are
very
highly
centralized
in
the
main
office
of
the
company
in
new
york
city
and
in
the
main
office
under
the
main
office
procedures
very
detailed
standards
and
methods
of
operation
are
provided,
the
company
details
in
great
specificity
just
how
the
business
is
to
be
conducted
at
the
local
level.
the
company
for
operational
purposes
divides
its
business
into
14
large
territories.
each
of
which
includes
a
number
of
states
and
each
of
which
is
under
the
direct
supervision
of
a
company
official
called
the
superintendent
of
agencies.
now,
within
each
one
of
these
14
territorial
districts
there
are
in
turn
a
large
number
of
district
offices
and
it
is
to
the
district
offices
to
which
the
individual
agents
who
sell
the
insurance
are
attached.
the
particular
office
with
which
we're
here
dealing
in
woonsocket,
rhode
island
is
in
the
company's
new
england
territory
which
embraces
five
states
and
the
state
of
rhode
island
itself
has
eight
district
offices
and
this
particular
district
office
employs
23
agents.
each
of
the
district
offices
of
the
company
is
under
the
supervision
of
a
district
manager
who
may
have
one
or
more
assistants.
and
the
district
manager
in
turn
is
directly
responsible
to
the
superintendent
of
agencies.
in
other
words,
the
chain
of
command
within
this
company
is
from
the
superintendent
of
agencies
in
the
main
office
in
new
york
directly
to
the
district
manager
at
the
local
level.
as
the
vice-president
of
the
company
explained,
he
characterize,
he
says
the
district
manager
is
the
chief
executive
in
his
particular
district.
and
this
man
as
the
chief
executive
has
immediate
supervisory
authority
over
all
the
agents
in
his
district.
the
actual
hiring
of
the
agents
is
done
by
the
home
office
but
the
responsibility
for
recruiting
new
agents
is
placed
upon
the
district
manager
and
it's
up
to
the
district
manager
to
solicit
applicants
for
openings
as
they
arise
and
if
he
finds
a
man
is
suitable
and
sends
--
and
sends
the
recommendation
forward
to
the
home
office
and
the
record
shows
that
approximately
three
quarters
of
his
recommendations
are
accepted.
when
a
new
agent
is
selected,
he
gets
his
initial
training
for
two
weeks
period
in
the
home
office
and
then
he
reports
to
his
district
where
he
undergoes
further
training
both
in
the
office
and
in
the
field
under
the
supervision
of
the
district
director
and
more
--
manager
and
more
directly
under
the
assistant
manager.
the
manager
among
other
things
regularly
reviews
the
agent's
performance
and
although
he
has
no
power
to
fire
just
like
his
power
to
hire,
he
may
recommend
to
the
home
office
that
the
agent
be
fired.
the
evidence
shows
that
there
is
virtually
no
shifting
of
agents
from
one
office
to
the
other.
it's
very
little
almost
no
transfer
at
all.
the
agents
generally
go
to
one
office
and
they
stay
there.
and
in
addition
to
that,
there
are
no
businesses
or
social
contacts
among
agents
except
at
the
particular
office
level.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
court
rose,
i
was
pointing
out
that
within
the
district
there
is
virtually
no
social
or
business
contact
except
--
i'm
sorry,
except
within
the
district.
the
agents
generally
do
not
have
any
social
business
contacts
among
the
district.
and
it's
just
one
other
fact
i'd
like
to
emphasize
which
is
that
when
an
agency
becomes
vacant
and
they
--
they
use
the
word
‘agency'
to
mean
the
particular
group
of
customers
that
an
agent
has.
when
an
agency
in
a
particular
district
becomes
vacant
only
the
agents
in
that
particular
district
under
the
company
practice
are
illegible
to
bid
to
get
that
agency.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
eight
district
offices
plus
one
or
two
what
are
known
as
the
detachable
offices.
that
is
an
office
that
is
a
separate
little
office
but
it's
under
the
supervision
of
manager
of
the
district
office
(voice
overlap)
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
geographically,
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
woonsocket,
and
the
next
closest
office
is
at
pawtucket
12
miles
away.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
if
i
may
--
may
say
right
here
and
now
mr.
justice
stewart
that
as
we
see
this
case
the
basic
issue
isn't
where
the
all
eight
of
the
offices
in
rhode
island
could've
been
combined
into
an
appropriate
unit.
the
question
is
whether
the
board
who
was
justified
in
selecting
this
particular
district
because
it's
well
settled
but
there
maybe
many
different
units
that
would
be
appropriate
for
purposes
of
collective
bargaining.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
our
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
--
that
is
correct
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
is
12
miles
away
but
if
i
may
put
it
--
if
--
if
i
may
refine
still
further
mr.
justice.
the
question
is
whether
in
selecting
this
particular
office,
the
board
treated
the
extent
of
organization
is
controlling
and
our
position
is
that
the
board
plainly
did
not
that
this
particular
district
office
maybe
justified
on
the
basis
of
the
board's
traditional
criteria.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
i
don't
understand
your
question.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
yes
mr.
justice
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
and
--
and
as
i
shall
attempt
to
show
what
we
think
what
the
board
has
done
and
the
board's
decisions
in
all
of
these
cases
are
fully
consistent
with
a
rationale
that
does
not
give
controlling
effect
to
the
extent
of
union
organization.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
think
we
have
to
look
at
each
particular
case
because
what
the
board
does
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
you
certainly
can
see
what
the
board
has
done
in
other
cases
but
i
suggest
mr.
justice
that
everyone
of
these
cases
is
fully
justifiable,
on
a
rationale
that
does
not
show
that
the
board
has
again
controlling
wide
to
the
extent
of
all
the
cases.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
i
think
you
--
you
have
to
look
--
you
can't
look
at
all
the
cases
together
in
other
words
because
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
we
--
we
have
no
quarrel.
we're
happy
to
have
you
look
at
all
of
the
cases
that
the
board
is
handling
in
this
field.
we
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
they
all
consistent
we
think.
we
think
they
are
all
fully
consistent
with
the
theory
that
the
board
has
expound
and
follow
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
--
we
have
no
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i've
missed
in
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
extent
of
an
organization
did
play
a
part
and
we
think
the
statute
does
not,
but
let
me
--
if
i
may
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
in
every
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
everyone
of
these
cases
the
unit
which
the
board
selected
was
the
unit
for
which
the
union
petition.
now,
let
me
--
if
--
if
i
may
just
explain
the
basis
before
its
basic
theory
in
this
area
which
has
been
spelled
out
most
fully
in
a
recent
decision
which
we've
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
involving
some
district
offices
in
connecticut.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
that's
all
it
said
but
that
they
--
they
referred
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
the
metropolitan
life
insurance
case
which
is
a
wilmington
case.
which
is
the
case
in
which
the
full
record
was
developed
and
which
either
takes
and
which
it
explains
a
greater
detail,
the
reasons
which
later
to
adopt
the
ruling
per
--
perhaps
it
would
be
better
mr.
justice
if
i
explain
what
the
board
held
in
wilmington
and
i
think
from
then
it
will
follow
into
some
of
the
other
questions
i've
had.
the
board
in
the
wilmington
case
concluded
that
the
individual
district
office
of
the
company
is
in
effect
a
separate
administrative
unit
through
which
the
company
conducts
its
business.
and
they
of
course
said
it
was
inherently
appropriate
for
purposes
of
collective
bargaining.
it
then
went
on
to
say
that
the
fact
that
the
particular
unit
the
particular
single
district
is
inherently
appropriate
doesn't
mean
that
a
combination
would
be
inappropriate.
and
in
the
wilmington
case,
it
selected
as
an
appropriate
unit,
the
two
district
offices
that
the
company
had
in
the
city
of
wilmington,
delaware
and
it
exclude
a
third
district
office
which
is
located
in
delaware,
delaware
approximately
46
miles
away
from
the
city
of
wilmington.
and
as
we
interpret
the
board's
statement
at
page
15
(a)
of
the
record
mr.
justice
goldberg
to
which
you
referred
all
that
they
are
saying
there
is,
well,
they
say
that
since
there
is
no
recent
history
of
collective
bargaining,
no
unions
seeking
a
larger
unit
and
the
district
office
sought
is
located
in
a
separate
and
distinct
geographical
area,
what
they
are
really
saying
is
that
this
case
therefore,
is
an
appropriate
one
to
apply
the
basic
principle
announced
in
wilmington
that
a
single
district
office
is
inherently
an
appropriate
unit.
that's
what
they
said
here.
there
was
no
and
as
the
board
explained
that
the
board
has
often
taken
the
position.
and
that
when
a
union
comes
in
and
asks
for
a
unit
that
is
inherently
appropriate
the
union
--
there
is
no
reason
why
the
union
should
be
required
to
operate
and
try
to
organize
employees
collectively
in
a
larger
unit.
and
this
--
this
it
seems
to
us
is
illustrated
in
these
cases
that
what
i
like
to
come
to
what
the
board
does.
the
board
has
basically
two
approaches
here.
when
a
single
district
office
is
sought
and
the
union
asked
for
a
single
district
office
the
board
treats
that
as
inherently
appropriate.
when
the
union
asked
for
a
combination
of
district
offices
the
board
will
grant
that
combination
provided
there
is
a
degree,
a
reasonable
degree
of
geographic
coherence
in
the
unit
that
it
is
sought.
that
is
in
some
instances
it
may
be
the
city
itself,
in
other
instances
it
may
be
broader,
it
may
be
the
metropolitan
area.
well,
the
question
maybe
is
what
kind
of
a
unit
would
not
be
considered
appropriate
in
the
insurance
industry?
well,
i
think
i
could
give
the
court
a
very
clear
illustration
of
that
which
is
the
wilmington
case
itself.
the
board
treated
the
two
district
offices
in
wilmington
as
appropriate
because
they
were
physically
in
the
city.
now,
if
the
union
had
come
in
and
said
it
wanted
a
unit
composed
of
just
one
of
those
two
districts
in
wilmington
plus
the
office
in
dover,
46
miles
away,
i
think
this
is
a
case
where
the
board
would
say
those
are
not
--
do
not
have
sufficient
connection
in
geographical
contiguity
to
make
them
a
separate
unit.
and
we
think
--
we
think
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
was
looking
at
the
purpose
of
it
that
prohibits
the
board
from
doing
this.
and
i
like
to
turn
to
the
statute
which
is
set
forth
on
page
30
of
our
brief.
now,
the
basic
statutory
provision
is
section
9
(b)
which
defines
the
board's
authority
to
select
the
appropriate
unit
and
then
i
would
admit
when
it
come
to
the
modifications
in
that
which
section
9
(c)
(5)
provided.
section
9
(b)
says
that
the
board
shall
decide
in
each
case
whether
in
order
to
assure
through
employees
the
fullest
freedom
in
exercising
the
rights
guaranteed
by
this
act,
the
unit
appropriate
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
shall
be
the
employer
unit,
craft
unit,
plant
unit,
was
subdivision
thereof.
in
other
words
this
statute
makes
it
clear
that
you
don't
define
an
appropriate
unit
in
a
vacuum.
you
define
what
unit
is
appropriate
in
terms
of
the
basic
policy
for
which
units
are
designated,
that
is
in
order
to
assure
the
employees
the
fullest
freedom
in
exercising
the
rights
guaranteed
under
the
act.
and
indeed
9
(c)
(5)
specifically
recognizes
that
that
is
the
purpose
for
which
appropriate
units
are
to
be
selected
because
it
says,
in
determining
whether
a
unit
is
appropriate
for
the
purposes
specified
in
subsection
(b)
that
is
coming
back
to
repeating
to
assure
the
employees
the
fullest
freedom
in
the
exercise
of
their
rights.
the
extent
to
which
the
employees
have
organized
shall
not
be
controlling.
now,
just
what
was
the
congress
find
to
get
out
of
this
provision
and
just
what
limitations
does
this
provision
put
upon
the
board's
power
to
establish
appropriate
units.
prior
to
1947,
there
had
been
a
number
of
board
decisions
including
many
in
the
insurance
field
in
which
the
board
had
created
small
units,
primarily
on
the
ground
that
if
the
employees
were
required
to
wait
until
there
have
been
organization
on
a
broader
basis
the
effect
of
that
would
be
to
deny
this
particular
group
of
employees
their
rights
to
collective
bargaining.
it's
safe
to
say
that
so
explicitly
the
court
to
frequently
uphold
these
facts.
in
other
words
these
were
cases
basically
in
which
under
the
board's
traditional
unit
criteria
you
could
not
sustain
them
weren't
not
for
the
fact
that
this
is
what
the
employees
were
seeking.
and
it
was
this
practice
that
congress
wished
to
put
a
hold
to.
in
other
words,
to
prevent
the
board
from
selecting
an
appropriate
unit
solely
because
this
was
the
extent
to
which
the
employees
had
been
organized.
but
we
think
the
legislative
history
makes
it
very
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
prevent
the
board
from
giving
effect
to
the
extent
of
organization
only
to
prevent
the
board
from
treating
it
as
controlling.
the
opponents
of
the
legislation
criticized
this
provision
because
they
said
that
it
would
prevent
among
other
things
the
organization
of
insurance
companies
and
other
firms
which
are
organized
on
a
scattered
basis
which
have
widely
dispersed
operations.
and
senator
taft
explained
why
the
effect
of
the
statute
would
not
be
that
and
we've
set
out
at
page
13
of
our
brief
a
rather
lengthy
quotation
which
is
from
the
supplementary
analysis
that
senator
taft
made
of
the
bill
six
days
after
it
had
been
passed
and
to
put
them
in
congressional
records
and
i
just
like
to
read
two
or
three
sentences
because
we
think
it
plainly
indicates
that
what
the
board
is
doing
in
these
insurance
cases
is
not
something
that
9
(c)
(5)
was
intended
to
prohibit.
and
senator
taft
stated,
opponents
of
the
bill
have
stated
that
it
prevent
the
establishment
of
smaller
operational
units
and
effectively
prevents
organization
of
public
utilities,
insurance
companies
and
other
businesses
who's
operations
are
widespread.
it
is
sufficient
answer
to
say
that
the
board
has
evolved
numerous
tests
to
determine
appropriate
units
and
he
goes
on
and
list
these
tests,
community
of
interest
of
employees
involved,
extent
of
common
supervision,
interchange
of
employees,
geographical
consideration,
etcetera,
anyone
of
which
may
justify
the
finding
of
a
small
unit.
i
may
just
afford
here
for
a
minute
to
say
that
these
various
tests
which
are
the
test
that
the
board
has
had
applied
in
the
past
and
still
applying
it
seems
to
me
are
clearly
met
by
the
selection
of
this
particular
district
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
i
think
back
in
the
40's
the
board
did
not
find
a
single
district
inappropriate,
it
didn't
have
to
get
that
far
because
as
the
statute
was
then
being
interpreted
it
looked
only
to
the
extent
of
organization.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
then
in
1944
in
another
case
involving
the
metropolitan
life
insurance
company
the
board
said
that
it
was
changing
its
rule
so
that
organization
of
insurance
companies
was
proceeding
very
nicely
and
rapidly
toward
a
statewide
basis
and
in
these
circumstances
the
board
concluded
that
it
would
not
deny
employees
of
insurance
companies
the
effectuation
of
their
rights
under
the
statute
to
make
them
wait
until
there
have
been
organization
on
a
statewide
basis.
and
that
announced
in
1944
that
henceforth
in
the
insurance
field
absence
among
exceptional
circumstances
it
would
not
consider
units
less
than
statewide
and
that
it
follow
that
rule
for
17
years.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
until
61
and
then
it
shifted.
and
during
that
period
it
frequently
dismissed
petitions
of
seeking
units
less
than
a
single
let's
say
as
in
statewide.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it
has
not
mr.
justice
and
i
--
let
me
explain
why
that
has
been.
in
their
appendix
to
their
brief
the
other
side
cites
46
cases
that
the
board
has
decided
since
quaker
city
in
all
of
which
the
unit
selected
as
appropriate
with
the
unit
for
which
the
union
petitioned.
thirty
two
of
those,
32
of
those,
roughly
two
thirds
involved
single
districts.
the
remainder
involves
some
combination,
either
citywide,
metropolitan
area
wide.
again,
in
each
one
of
these
cases
we
think
that
they
are
consistent
with
the
board's
basic
rationale
but
you
may
combine,
you
may
combine
geographically
coherent
districts
into
a
single
appropriate
unit.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
those
are
two
detached
offices.
well,
that
is
at
a
single
district
which
the
company
decided
apparently
that
was
not
sufficient
business
of
whatever
reason
to
set
up
separate
districts
in
the
other
states.
so,
it
attached
those
two
districts
to
that
particular
district
office.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
in
administrative
(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
and
the
board
always
treats
this
satellite
attached
offices
is
part
of
the
single
district.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it
--
it
has
--
it
has
no
autonomy
in
labor
matters.
collective
bargaining
agreements
are
negotiated
at
the
home
office
and
in
addition
to
that
old
grievances
which
involve
questions
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
are
taken
up
with
the
stress
with
the
superintendent
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
and
so
the
collective
bargaining
under
the
company
practices
would
take
place
with
the
home
office.
i
--
i
might
say
mr.
justice
incidentally
that
under
the
company's
theory,
under
the
company's
theory
it's
difficult
to
see
how
they
come
out
and
ask
for
a
statewide
unit.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
they
say
that
the
adminis
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
companywide
or
at
least
the
territorial,
the
big
territorial
district
because
the
say
that's
the
administrative
unit
by
which
the
company
has.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
region,
in
this
case
five
states
that
that
would
--
that
would
seem
to
be
under
their
theory
the
minimum
size
of
the
unit.
and
that
of
course
is
contrary
to
the
metropolitan
case.
let
--
let
me
if
i
may
just
add
something
explain
why
the
board
in
1961
departed
from
the
metropolitan
and
then
i
should
say
that
the
metropolitan
decision
during
the
17
years
it
was
in
existence
how
it
was
a
very
unusual
thing
because
ordinarily
throughout
this
period,
the
board
decided
questions
of
representation
on
the
basis
of
particular
fact.
it
didn't
have
automatic
board
rules.
and
in
1961
when
the
board
overruled
the
metropolitan
case,
it
said
that
the
experienced
that
it
had
under
the
metropolitan
rule
indicated
that
organization
of
insurance
agents
had
not
taken
place
with
the
speed
and
effectiveness
that
have
been
anticipated.
and
it
therefore
said
that
the
effect
of
the
metropolitan
rule
of
refusing
to
certify
less
than
statewide
units
had
been
to
arrest
the
organizational
development
of
the
agents.
and
it
therefore
concluded
there
was
no
longer
any
basis
for
applying
a
different
rule
to
insurance
agents
than
it
was
applying
to
other
industries
and
it
therefore
said
we
will
henceforth
apply
our
normal
unit
principles
to
the
cases
as
they
arise.
and
we
--
we
think
that's
precisely
what
the
board
has
been
doing
in
this
field
it
has
been
applying
its
normal
unit
principles.
i
just
like
again
to
stress
because
i
think
this
is
the
factor
that
we
think
led
the
first
circuit
into
error
in
finding
an
inconsistency
in
the
board
decision.
i'd
like
to
stress
that
the
question
isn't
whether
there
are
some
other
unit
that
might
be
more
appropriate.
the
question
is
whether
the
particular
unit
is
an
appropriate
unit
and
the
board
has
frequently
recognized
in
these
cases
that
said
that,
“well,
perhaps
a
larger
unit
might
be
appropriate,
perhaps
a
smaller
unit
might
be
appropriate,”
but
in
all
effect
as
we
consider
this
particular
unit
is
appropriate
and
that's
what
we
think
the
board
has
done
in
this
case
and
we
think
this
was
well
within
what
this
court
has
acknowledged
to
be,
to
be
broads
boards
discretion
in
selecting
(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
the
board's
--
in
the
board's
decision
and
as
the
third
circuit
has
pointed
out
mr.
justice
stewart
in
upholding
the
board's
decision
in
the
wilmington
case
the
fact
that
this
was
the
controlling
consideration
in
the
union's
decision.
to
seek
this
unit
is
not
the
question.
the
question
is
was
the
board
controlled
by
the
extendable
organization.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
the
question.
we
think
that
in
this
case
the
board
is
permitted
to
take
into
account
the
union's
request
and
it
has
however
not
made
its
decision
solely
depend
on
the
point,
it
was
not
controlled
by
this.
it's
admittedly
was
influenced
by
it
but
that
is
we
think
no
more
than
statute
allows.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
they
--
mr.
justice
the
board
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
didn't
in
this
case
but
they
did
in
the
wilmington
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
not
--
it's
not
an
(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
perhaps,
inherently
is
an
unfortunate
word
in
this
context
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
--
if
i
may
answer,
i
--
i
think
that
three
part
to
your
question
mr.
justice
may
i
--
i
may
try
to
answer
it
separately.
first,
in
the
wilmington
case
which
was
the
basis
of
the
board's
decision
in
this
case,
the
court
did
explain
the
reasons
why
the
single
district
office
as
a
separate
administrative
unit
of
the
company
was
an
appropriate
unit.
and
--
and
the
board
has
also
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
the
board
says
that
where
--
wherever
you
have
a
--
i
--
conceivably
if
you
had
a
different
factual
record,
if
you
had
a
different
factual
record
in
an
unusual
thing
but
there
is
no
question
in
the
case
that
all
of
these
district
offices
throughout
the
country
are
operating
the
same
way,
i
mean
we
have
the
record
in
this
case,
in
the
wilmington
case
which
has
been
stipulated
in
this
case,
stipulated
(voice
overlap)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
no
mr.
justice.
the
two
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
two
dist
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
two
districts
would
have
to
have
something
more
than
the
fact
that
the
union
had
organized
them.
if
--
well
let
me
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
it's
a
geographic
coherence.
if
i
may
illustrate
with
one
--
another
case,
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
let's
assume
there
are
ten
offices
in
the
district
of
columbia,
they
are
scattered
all
around
and
the
union
first
organizes
a
single
district
office
in
the
upper
northwest.
it
can't
organize
any
others
except
a
single
district
office
in
the
lower
part
of
southeast
but
the
opposite
parts
of
the
town
i
don't
think
the
board
could
find
that
those
two
district
offices
constituted
inappropriate
unit,
they
are
miles
apart,
these
two
are
separate
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
weren't
quite
that
far
but
again
mr.
justice
they
were
about
30
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
33
miles
from
the
upper
--
from
the
suburbs
to
the
center
of
town.
but
again
in
chicago
there
--
there
was
a
geographic
basis
for
it.
this
was
the
city
line,
this
was
the
line
of
the
city.
thank
you.
