justice
hugo
l.
black
you
came
up
to
the
factor
to
the
last
minute
and
you
only
discussed
it
in
about
a
minute.
what
do
you
understand
the
statute
does
require?
i'm
not
talking
about
its
history,
the
language
of
the
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
gives
it
some
weight
then
what
is
the
standard
(voice
overlap)
like
to
be?
i'm
having
trouble
with
your
argument
in
the
part
of
the
government's
argument
is
that
it
seems
to
me
the
statute
did
not
intend
for
the
board
try
to
set
up
permanent
definition
to
determine
the
very
broad
power
--
under
the
very
broad
power
given
decide
in
each
separate
case,
that's
direct
in
it,
in
each
case
on
a
case
by
case
basis
under
what
policy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
decide
in
each
case
in
all
of
it
this
is
not
this
--
the
supreme
criterion
which
they
have
to
follow
in
order
to
assure
its
employees
the
fullest
freedom
in
exercising
rights
guaranteed
by
the
act.
isn't
that
the
supreme
test?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
isn't
that
the
supreme
test
that
congress
set
out
so
far
as
the
board's
power
within
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
assure
to
employees
the
fullest
freedom
in
exercising
their
rights,
all
the
rights
guaranteed
by
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
effect
to
the
employee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
can
they
make
a
definite
decision
and
say
that
we
always
going
to
consider
this
is
it
without
regard
to
--
to
anything
else?
this
has
to
be
in
it,
how
can
they
do
that
and
comply
with
--
with
that,
with
these?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
9
(c)
(5)
says
in
determining
whether
the
union
is
appropriate
for
the
purposes
specified
the
extent
to
which
the
employees
have
organized
shall
not
be
controlling.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
does
that
say
it
shall
not
be
given
any
weight?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
must
be
given
weight
then
after
all
how
you
ever
going
to
get
one
--
any
one
case,
i
have
listen
to
you
carefully
because
i
--
i
might
not
have
at
all
hear
later
in
this
case.
but
it
looks
to
me
that
you
have
been
arguing
that
if
they
have
held
in
one
city
it's
got
to
be
citywide
as
the
rule.
if
they
held
it's
got
to
be
statewide,
that's
the
rule.
why
is
it
not
perfectly
in
line
with
what
the
congress
has
told?instead
all
of
the
circumstances
of
each
case
do
not
in
any
instant
go
only
on
the
basis
that
the
unit,
the
extent
to
which
the
employers
have
organized
don't
go
on
that,
don't
go
on
that
anytime
but
go
only
with
basis
of
all
of
the
facts
and
all
of
the
circumstances
and
you
have
attempted
up
to
date,
i
have
--
i
haven't
heard
any
argument
shows.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
i've
--
i've
been
bothered
a
little
by
the
government's
side
because
it
seems
to
me
like
that
it
was
taking
the
position.
if
the
board
has
power
despite
the
fact
that
they
are
commended
to
decide
according
to
circumstances
in
each
case
to
establish
criteria
in
which
those
bind
them
all
of
the
time,
i'm
bothered
by
that
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
as
i
understand
if
you
permit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
that
the
board
didn't
say
that
and
they
never
would
say
that
(voice
overlap)
i
agree
with
you
for
that.
you
say
that
i
have
estab
--
i
have
proof
here
that
that's
exactly
what
they've
done
and
that's
what
your
issue
finally
comes
down
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
to
be
solely
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
should
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
another
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
bothers
me
about
is
maybe
it's
altogether
wrong
that
i
was
looking
to
it,
when
you
say
the
board
having
established
the
criteria
is
that
to
stay
right
within
it
but
what
bothers
me
about
that
is
it
is
very
much
like
this
broad
power
that's
given
to
them,
it'
is
very
much
like
the
power
of
a
jury
to
decide
in
some
nebulous
and
it
is
nebulous,
broad
standards
like
what's
good
for
the
person
or
what
was
negative.
bringing
in
your
imaginary
people
and
you
are
saying
as
i
understand
that
they've
got
to
have
stand
that
would
be
using
every
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
board
has
the
power,
i
doubt
if
the
board
has
the
power
either.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
fully
understand
your
argument
(voice
overlap)
if
it's
shown
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
if
shown
that
they
did
you
had
controlling
consideration
under
this
which
you
said
there
should
not
have
violated
the
law
and
we
should
say
so.
the
problem
is
that
you
add
to
that
when
you
make
the
argument
on
that
pages,
consideration
is
heard
and
that
you
want
to
limit
them
considerations
they've
given
in
this
case
to
considerations
they've
given
in
other
cases.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
but
it
doesn't
seems
to
--
congress
doesn't
seems
to
authorize
the
board
to
consider
this
case
on
the
basis
of
what's
best
for
the
company
but
only
on
issuing
an
order
which
assures
the
employees
to
call
this
freedom.
am
i
right
in
thinking
is
it
only
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
rather
on
unusual.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
as
far
as
the
assurance
to
the
employees
not
to
the
company?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
think
this
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
can
in
any
basis.
i
have
been
asking
this,
are
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
can
base
it
on
what's
for
them
is
convenient
to
the
company
rather
than
what's
best
to
assure
their
employees
for
them
not
to
strike?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
test
of
the
statute
is,
the
only
test
what's
best
for
the
employees
in
aiding
them
to
organize.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
say
and
what

justice
hugo
l.
black
well
what
if
it
say,
where
does
it
make
the
test
with
reference
to
this,
maybe
it
does,
i'm
not
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
make
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
agree
to
that
but
i'm
talking
about
with
reference
to
this
particular
provision
which
is
especially
written.
what
--
what
does
the
board
have
a
right
to
consider
except
what
revealed
the
employees
the
fullest
freedom
in
exercising
their
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
the
general
purpose
of
the
act,
i'm
--
by
familiarity
with
it
is
why
i
was
surprise
to
find
that
it
is
written
this
way
when
on
--
when
we
inspect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
okay.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
read
section,
the
section
this
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
with
reference
to
this
section?
