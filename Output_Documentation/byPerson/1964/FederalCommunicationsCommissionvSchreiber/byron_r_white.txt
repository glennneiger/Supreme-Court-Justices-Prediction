justice
byron
r.
white
at
this
point,
i
take
it
that
as
far
as
the
annex
is
concerned,
mr.
douglas,
the
case
is
over
as
far
as
that's
concerned.
that's
in
the
record.
it's
not
to
be
--
i
mean
as
far
--
you're
asking
us
to
the
--
the
effect
of
our
ruling
as
you
requested
would
be
that
annex
a
is
in
the
record
and
it
is
public.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
testimony
is
otherwise,
as
far
as
testimony
--
justice
byron
r.
white
we'll
recess
now.
mr.
douglas,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps
the
annex
b
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.

(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
susman,
how
about
applying
that
to
annex
b
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
asked
for,
it
was
refused
and
now
it's
important.
what
possible
bases
that
you've
got
for
saying
that
annex
b
should
be
held
confidential
and
unpublic
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
until
the
termination
of
the
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
wait,
my
question
is
whether
the
issue
shouldn't
be
decided
now.
which
--
should
the
confidentiality
of
annex
b
be
decided
in
this
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
and
the
annex
either
admitted
publicly,
or
subject
to
some
sort
of
a
confidential
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
--
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
matter
of
the
questioning.
that's
a
matter
of
the
questioning
later.
but
here's
a
document,
it's
on
its
face,
it's
got
certain
information
in
it
or
on
it,
and
it's
offered
in
evidence.
and
you
come
in
and
say,
“the
list
is
confidential
and
we
ought
to
postpone,
making
a
public
delay
into
the
hearing”,
and
giving
no
other
reason
whatsoever
and
--
why
shouldn't
the
--
why
shouldn't
the
decision
on
that
document
wholly
aside
from
the
other
questions
which
may
come
up
be
made
now
in
this
proceeding?
i'm
not
saying
which
way
it
ought
to
be
made,
maybe
it
should
be
ruled
that
it's
confidential.
but
shouldn't
the
decision
be
made
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
attorney
general,
there's
something
that
(inaudible)
regarding
confidentiality
here
other
than
whether
the
act
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
--
so
they
entail
the
needs
of
