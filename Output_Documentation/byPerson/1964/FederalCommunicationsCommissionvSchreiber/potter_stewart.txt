justice
potter
stewart
mca
had
been
the
defendant
in
an
antitrust
action
earlier,
had
it?
or
what
was
the
chronology
of
that?
because
before
--
at
one
stage
of
the
game,
mca
was
also
an
agent
for
a
talent,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
at
this
time,
they
were
in
both?
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
suppose
that's
not
very
relevant
to
this.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
the
investigation
was
about?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
douglas,
if
--
if
you
prevail
here
as
i
understand
it,
it
would
be
your
thought,
if
i
understood
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
goldberg,
a
question
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
the
--
on
the
--
on
the,
on
--
in
the
future
hearings
now
before
the
commission,
this
respondent
could
protect
himself
by
refusing
to
answer
any
given
question
or
by
refusing
to
produce
any
--
any
given
thing
that
might
have
--
might
be
subpoenaed
and
then
when
he
test
that
seriatim
one
by
one
with
the
court
or
would
they
wait
until
it
was
all
over
and
then
deal
with
the
court
--
or
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
what
would
the
procedure
be?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
with
the
--
and
the
standards
should
be
--
you
tell
us,
the
standard
with
the
district
court
should
then
apply
would
be
whether
or
not
the
commission
--
the
commission
had
abused
its
discretion,
and
its
discretion,
you
tell
us,
is
very
broad.
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
though
under
judge
yankwich's
honor,
the
burden
of
showing
that
this
should
be
made
public
would
be
upon
the
commission,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
commission
would
be
the
moving
party?
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
up
to
them
to
show
good
cause
and
isn't
that
the
burden
of
proof?
