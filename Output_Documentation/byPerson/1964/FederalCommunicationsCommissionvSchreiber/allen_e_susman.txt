mr.
allen
e.
susman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
threshold
question
before
this
court
is
i
think
really
the
question
of
definition
of
the
issue.
the
federal
communication
commission
has
taken
the
position
throughout
the
case
up
to
an
including
the
time
of
this
argument
that
this
is
a
question
of
an
order
made
by
a
federal
district
court
which
has
a
permanent,
conclusive,
final
aspect
attached
to
it.
but
that
is
not
what
we
have
here.
we
have
an
order
of
an
interim
nature
made
by
judge
yankwich
which
is
now
being
challenged
and
an
order
which
in
the
context
of
the
record
that
was
then
before
judge
yankwich
was
eminently
proper
and
eminently
designed
to
lead
to
the
very
result
that
the
fcc
on
analysis
would
really
i
think,
want
to
have
and
namely
result
which
is
time-saving,
efficient,
and
which
does
not
derogate
from
the
agency
function
as
distinguished
from
the
court
function.
now,
for
all
we
know
at
this
stage
of
the
game,
there
may
be
no
issue
of
confidentiality
whichever
becomes
adjudicated
on
any
substantive
basis.
because
what
judge
yankwich
ordered
very
simply
was
that
the
testimony
should
be
given
by
mca
or
its
representative,
be
given
in
a
private
hearing
originally.
thereafter,
the
fcc
now
having
had
the
testimony
could
determine
whether
or
not
it
should
be
released
publicly,
or
whether
in
their
opinion
it
should
be
released
publicly,
whether
in
their
opinion
it
should
be
held
on
a
confidential
basis,
or
whatever
disposition
they
might
initially
determine
to
do
with
it.
it
was
only
after
the
testimony
had
been
taken
and
the
commission
has
had
an
opportunity
to
determine
what
position
it
wished
to
take,
that
the
matter
then
was
to
come
back
to
judge
yankwich
for
him
in
effect
make
a
determination
of
the
propriety
of
the
commission
ruling.
all
judge
yankwich
was
asking
for
was
an
opportunity
to
have
a
complete
record,
rather
than
trying
to
determine
a
question
on
what
was
then
a
somewhat
hypothetical
or
assumed
basis.
and
in
the
context
of
the
record,
that
judge
yankwich
which
was
then
faced
with,
i
say
that
decision
on
his
part
was
eminently
proper.
i
think
it
would
be
held
--
mr.
allen
e.
susman
no,
you
honor.
i
don't
think
that
necessarily
follows.
he
said
in
his
order
that
the
material
would
be
revealed
upon
motion
for
good
cause
shown.
now,
i
don't
think
he
was
really
--
mr.
allen
e.
susman
correct.
mr.
allen
e.
susman
well,
as
i
say,
it's
susceptible
perhaps
to
that
interpretation,
but
that,
i
don't
think
was
what
he
had
in
mind.
what
i
think
judge
yankwich
was
saying
was
if
there
had
to
be
some
reason
for
disclosure
of
the
confidential
material
or
the
allegedly
confidential
material.
i
don't
think
he
was
concerned
at
that
point
with
whether
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
one
side
or
the
other.
i
think
he
was
just
dealing
with
the
ultimate
fact.
and
in
any
event,
if
it
were
a
question
of
burden
of
proof,
then
i
presume
it
would
be
on
a
moving
party
in
accordance
with
the
usual
decisions
in
that
line
including
the
one
that
was
announced
this
morning,
where
i
think
that
specific
point
was
made
as
the
decision
was
read.
now,
i
think
that
it's
important
to
look
at
the
record
as
i
say
that
was
before
judge
yankwich
at
the
time.
beginning
with
the
hearings
on
this
particular
investigatory
proceeding
having
to
do
with
television,
broadcasting
practices,
and
how
programs
were
selected,
how
they
get
on
the
air,
beginning
in
1957,
and
actually
two
years
before
that,
up
until
the
present
time,
there
have
been
as
attorney
general
douglas
indicated,
some
12,000
pages
of
transcript
thus
far,
and
as
i
recall
it
some
200
or
more
witnesses
who
have
testified
in
this
proceeding
with
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
exhibits.
of
all
the
witnesses
and
of
all
the
testimony,
only
mca
and
its
representative
was
singled
out
for
an
inquisitorial
kind
of
examination.
not
only
through
the
witness
that
testified
on
its
behalf,
its
vice
president
mr.
schreiber,
but
also
from
a
standpoint
of
a
great
many
other
witnesses.
for
example,
the
networks,
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
nbc
was
cross-examined
in
effect
but
without
benefit
of
counsel
to
represent
him
as
to
whether
or
not
nbc
had
shown
preferential
treatment
to
mca
in
the
course
of
the
years
of
dealing
between
a
producer
of
television
programming
and
a
network.
similarly
other
network
representatives
were
asked
the
same
kind
of
question.
other
witnesses
having
to
do
with
the
production
of
programs
on
an
independent
basis
were
asked
time
and
again
in
the
course
of
this
hearing
whether
or
not
they
found
it
difficult
to
obtain
actors
and
actresses
and
other
creative
talent
for
their
shows.
and
thus
we're
unable
to
compete
on
an
even
basis
or
a
fair
basis
with
mca
because
mca
was
not
only
a
producer
of
television
programming,
but
was
also
a
theatrical
agent
representing
some
of
the
people
in
question.
and
is
--
it
was
--
as
was
born
out
by
the
record,
mca
at
this
time
was
--
had
been
granted
a
waiver
by
the
applicable
guilds
having
to
do
with
this
field
of
endeavor,
permitting
them
to
act
in
both
capacities.
but
there
was
a
great
deal
of
questioning
of
this
sort
and
as
the
record
indicates
it
was
directed
towards
the
witnesses
in
a
manner
which
was
designed
almost
or
tempted
to
design
an
affirmative
answer
to
a
question
which
would
indicate
some
wrongdoing
on
the
part
of
mca.
now,
this
happened
before
the
testimony
of
mr.
schreiber,
it
continued
after
the
testimony
of
mr.
schreiber
in
a
series
of
hearings
in
various
parts
of
the
country.
in
addition,
only
with
respect
to
mca
was
a
copy
of
the
mca
s-1
form
filed
with
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
placed
into
evidence,
together
with
an
analysis
of
that
form
which
was
designed
to
show
again,
as
the
comments
indicate
and
which
is
part
of
it
in
the
record
here,
that
there
was
something
strange,
peculiar,
unique,
wrong
about
mca's
activities
as
indicated
on
the
s-1
form.
now,
that's
the
background
of
the
case
apart
from
the
testimony
of
mr.
schreiber
and
the
incidents
that
developed
in
the
course
of
that
interrogation.
mr.
allen
e.
susman
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
was
purpose
of
the
investigation
--
mr.
allen
e.
susman
at
least,
that
wasn't
the
announced
purpose.
the
announced
purpose
was
to
determine
the
methods
and
the
practices
and
the
procedures
involved
in
the
process.
not
from
the
standpoint
of
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
any
wrongdoing,
but
to
determine
how
it
actually
worked.
what
was
involved
in
this
process
by
which
a
script
written
by
a
writer
ultimately
developed
into
a
film
shown
on
a
television
station
in
albuquerque,
new
mexico?
that
as
i
view
it,
was
the
impact
of
the
various,
enabling
orders
which
came
down
from
the
commission
on
this
particular
hearing.
mr.
allen
e.
susman
i
think
it
was
--
again,
it
may
have
been
one
of
the
purposes.
mr.
allen
e.
susman
i
say,
it
may
have
been
one
of
the
purposes
to
try
to
develop
some
indication
of
wrongdoing
on
somebody
--
mr.
allen
e.
susman
well,
perhaps
as
i
say
--
mr.
allen
e.
susman
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor
please,
i
feel
that
the
--
that
the
enabling
orders
were
basically
designed
to
bring
out
on
an
informational
basis
how
it
worked
rather
than
to
establish
any
wrongdoing
on
anybody's
part.
secondly,
and
perhaps,
in
more
direct
response
to
your
question,
i'm
not
saying
that
the
commission
does
not
have
the
right,
under
some
circumstances
to
try
to
develop
a
course
of
wrongdoing
on
somebody's
part.
i
doubt
whether
the
inquisitorial
powers
of
an
investigatory
hearing
is
the
proper
method
and
the
proper
way
in
which
that
should
be
accomplished.
i
don't
think
that
by
investigatory
proceeding,
this
particular
agency
has
the
power
or
the
right
to
be
to
try
to
develop
an
antitrust
case
or
try
to
develop
a
conspiracy
case,
or
try
to
develop
any
kind
of
a
case
of
that
nature.
i
don't
think
this
is
the
purpose
or
the
scope,
or
the
proper
use
of
an
investigatory
proceeding.
and
certainly
not
of
this
particular
investigatory
proceeding
where
mca
is
not
a
licensee
of
the
commission,
where
at
least
in
theory,
it's
only
tangentially
drawn
into
the
controversy
because
of
the
fact
that
happens
to
produce
television
programming.
mr.
allen
e.
susman
justice
goldberg,
maybe
i
didn't
make
myself
clear.
there
were
many,
many
other
witnesses
in
the
course
of
these
hearings,
but
the
particular
approach
taken
by
the
commission
with
regard
to
the
inquisitorial
nature
of
the
questioning,
the
attempt
to
find
some
evil
motive
or
some
evil
act
on
the
part
of
any
company
was
only
directed
to
mca.
mr.
allen
e.
susman
well,
i
don't
know
what
the
reason
was.
it
wasn't
announced
during
the
course
of
the
hearing.
the
only
indication
we
have
is
in
a
brief
filed
in
the
course
of
an
intermediate
phase
of
this
proceeding
where
there's
some
indication
of
the
commission
was
working
in
some
capacity
with
the
department
of
justice
at
the
time
and
these
was
a
--
mr.
allen
e.
susman
yes,
your
honor.
it's
correct
to
a
point,
but
i
think
it
has
again
to
be
looked
at
the
standpoint
of
what
actually
occurred
at
this
hearing.
at
the
hearing
itself,
the
counsel
for
the
witness
was
not
given
the
opportunity
by
self-enunciated
ground
rules
to
speak
for
his
client.
it
was
placed
somewhat
in
the
category
of
a
consultant
if
the
non-lawyer
witness
happened
to
recognize
that
a
legal
point
was
involved.
he
could
turn
to
the
lawyer
and
ask
him
a
question
about
it
and
that
was
about
the
only
function
that
a
lawyer
could
serve
under
the
ground
rules
enunciated
in
this
proceeding.
and
as
matter
of
fact,
when
the
counsel
for
the
witness
attempted
to
make
some
sort
of
a
record
to
establish
some
greater
right
to
counsel,
then
the
hearing
officer
had
enunciated,
the
attorney
was
threatened
with
ejection
and
with
contempt.
now,
that
was
the
context
of
the
particular
question
that
your
honor
is
asking
about.
also,
the
commission
has
never
recognized
an
appealable
right
as
a
matter
of
right
to
an
order
of
this
kind.
where
does
the
affidavit
get
filed
and
by
whom?
under
the
ground
rules
that
were
laid
down
for
this
hearing,
there
was
no
real
opportunity
to
file
anything
of
this
sort.
there
was
no
real
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
this
subject,
and
confidentiality,
incidentally
which
again
i
think
buttresses
judge
yankwich's
approach
to
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
where
the
more
you
justify
the
confidentiality,
the
more
you
disclose
the
trade
secret
for
confidential
material
that
you
are
trying
to
protect.
that's
why
judge
yankwich's
order
calling
for
in
camera
proceedings
seemed
to
me
so
sensible
and
so
sound.
now,
it
has
so
happened
and
i
think
mr.
douglas
--
pardon?
mr.
allen
e.
susman
that's
alright.
i
think
i'm
through
with
that
point.
mr.
allen
e.
susman
if
a
subject
were
at
large,
your
honor,
i
would
not,
i
think.
but
i
think
under
the
decision
in
hannah
versus
larche,
we
have
to
recognize
that
there
is
an
area
where
the
traditional
safeguards
of
due
process
such
as
confrontation
of
witnesses
and
knowledge
of
the
charges
and
whose
making
those,
are
somewhat
different
in
investigatory
proceedings
than
they
are
in
adjudicatory
proceedings.
mr.
allen
e.
susman
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
quite
different
in
the
two
cases.
i
think
when
it
comes
to
a
matter
of
delegation
to
an
administrative
agency,
there
is
a
more
rigorous
view
taken
of
the
lengths
to
which
that
agency
can
go
in
dealing
unfairly
or
in
a
manner
which
is
claimed
to
be
unfair
if
the
matter
where
being
questioned
at
large
and
is
true
of
a
legislative
committee.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
allen
e.
susman
--
you
can
equate–
mr.
allen
e.
susman
i
think
i'm
speaking
in
both
areas,
your
honor.
at
least
that
has
been
the
approach
of
the
cases
as
i
view
them
over
the
years.
again,
in
pointing
out
the
approach
taken
by
the
commission
in
this
particular
hearing,
mr.
schreiber
had
a
very,
very
difficult
decision
to
make
as
to
how
to
protect
his
record
without
suffering
very
onerous
conditions.
it
was
not
only
question
as
i've
indicated
of
possible
ejection
of
his
counsel
from
the
proceeding
and
a
possible
contempt
proceeding
against
the
attorney.
but
in
addition,
the
commission
made
it
clear
that
it
intended
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
united
states
attorney,
possible
criminal
proceedings
against
mr.
schreiber
for
failure
to
testify
as
the
commission
wanted
him
to
testify.
now,
let
me
stop
there
for
a
moment,
if
i
may.
as
i
examine
this
record,
there
is
nowhere
anything
wrong
that
i
can
perceive
that
mca
has
done
or
mr.
schreiber
has
done
in
connection
with
his
testimony
given
in
the
proceedings
to
which
i
have
alluded.
and
yet
this
one
witness
was
alone
of
any
of
the
several
hundred
threatened
with
a
possible
criminal
contempt
proceeding.
now,
that's
why
i
feel
so
strongly
that
this
was
a
case
where
the
federal
court
or
judge
yankwich
had
to
find
and
did
find
an
approach
to
this
which
protected
the
witness
against
this
kind
of
threatening
action
on
the
part
of
the
commission
and
still
permitted
the
commission
to
get
the
testimony
which
it
sought
to
obtain
from
this
particular
witness
in
this
particular
company.
mr.
allen
e.
susman
the
only
--
there
were
several
other
witnesses
your
honor,
who
took
the
same
approach
i
think
based
on
the
lead
of
mca
in
this
particular
matter,
legal
approach.
there
were
several
other
witnesses
i
think
who
came
after
mca
who
followed
the
lead
of
mca.
but
apart
from
those
and
apart
form
the
companies
that
were
involved
in
the
court
proceedings
in
the
cohn
case
which
is
an
antecedent
to
this
case
in
the
district
court
in
new
york.
there
were
a
number
of
companies
at
that
time
who
were
independent
producers,
who
also
questioned
the
right
of
the
commission
to
obtain
certain
information
claimed
to
be
confidential.
the
difference
between
the
two
situations
is
within
the
cohn
case
in
new
york,
the
commission
had
indicated
what
it
wanted
by
sending
out
a
questionnaire.
it
was
simply
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
information
called
for
by
the
questionnaire
should
be
provided
or
shouldn't
it.
it
wasn't
a
case
like
here
where
we
don't
know
as
yet
what
the
commission
intends
to
ask
the
witnesses,
although
we
have
a
pretty
good
idea
that
it's
going
to
be
a
rather
comprehensive
interrogation.
it's
also
i
think
of
importance
to
recognize
the
rules
under
which
the
commission
was
operating
in
the
course
of
this
inquiry.
the
right
to
counsel
point
is
perhaps
academic
at
this
juncture
because
of
the
enunciation
by
this
commission
and
by
others
including
the
federal
trade
commission
of
a
definition
of
the
right
to
counsel
which
follows
by
and
large
the
decision
of
judge
yankwich
in
this
case.
but
it
is
important
to
show
the
climate
in
which
these
decisions
were
being
made
by
the
commission
and
the
manner
of
subjection
of
the
witness
to
interrogation
by
the
commission
counsel.
now
also,
not
directly
involved
but
i
think
importantly
involved
from
this
tangential
aspect
are
the
rules
under
which
this
commission
was
operating
at
the
time.
the
only
published
rules
applying
to
this
hearing
was
rule
--
was
a
rule
of
the
commission
which
in
effect
turned
over
to
the
hearing
examiner
the
right
to
make
rules
of
procedure
as
it
went
along.
there
was
no
procedure
enunciated
by
the
commission
other
than
leaving
it
to
the
hearing
commit
--
hearing
officer,
hearing
examiner
on
a
delegated
basis
the
right
to
do
what
he
felt
was
proper
in
the
course
of
the
proceeding.
so
again,
in
answer
to
the
prior
question,
nobody
could
tell
in
the
course
of
this
proceeding
what
procedure
was
necessary
to
effectuate
and
protect
the
rights
of
a
witness
because
there
was
nothing
to
turn
to,
there
was
nothing
to
look
at,
and
it
was
necessary
as
i
said
to
more
or
less
go
along
on
the
basis
of
trying
to
make
the
best
record
possible
under
the
onerous
conditions
that
were
being
laid
down
by
the
commission.
now,
i
think
it's
helpful
to
look
at
the
difference
between
the
results
under
the
judge
yankwich
approach
and
the
results
under
the
approach
of
the
commission.
if
judge
yankwich's
decision
were
to
be
followed,
it
would
mean
that
a
full
and
complete
interrogation
of
mca
and
its
representative
could
be
held
by
the
commission.
that
information
would
then
be
examined
by
the
commission
presumably
and
a
decision
would
be
reached
by
the
commission
as
to
whether
it
wished
to
keep
it
confidential
or
it
wished
to
disclose
it
publicly.
it
then
could
bring
the
matter
in
the
event
that
it
wished
to
disclose
the
information
publicly
and
in
the
further
event
that
mca
objected
to
that
procedure.
it
could
then
come
into
the
district
court
and
have
the
district
court
make
its
determination
of
whether
or
not
the
commission
was
right
or
wrong
in
the
approach
that
was
taken.
but
this
procedure
would
permit,
i
feel,
the
hearing
to
proceed
in
much
more
expeditious
fashion
than
the
approach
taken
by
the
commission
and
would
moreover
give
the
commission
the
information
which
it
seeks
to
have.
if
you
follow
the
commission
approach
in
this
matter,
you
have
a
series
of
interrupted
hearings
in
which
a
claim
of
confidentiality
is
being
made
followed
by
a
resort
to
the
enforcement
procedures
of
the
federal
court,
followed
by
a
return
presumably
for
further
interrogation
and
so
on
in
a
way
which
would
stretch
these
hearings
out
to
a
much
greater
length
than
would
be
involved
if
the
approach
of
judge
yankwich
were
followed.
now,
the
commission
has
taken
the
position,
as
i
read
their
brief,
that
even
though
judge
yankwich's
approach
may
be
sensible,
may
be
logical,
may
be
fair,
the
underlying
question
is
whether
it
is
right
as
a
matter
of
law.
i
don't
think
the
two
are
inconsistent.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
taking
all
of
the
cases
in
this
field
as
a
block,
the
cases
cited
by
the
commission
and
the
cases
cited
by
the
respondent
in
this
case,
they
all
ultimately
lead
to
the
same
result.
there
is
a
review
power
in
the
federal
courts,
that
review
power
is
based
on
essential
doctrines
of
fairness,
essential
doctrines
of
good
sense.
the
very
thing
that
judge
yankwich's
opinion
and
decision
was
designed
to
accomplish
in
this
case.
i
don't
even
think
the
commission
takes
any
issue
with
the
question
of
efficiency.
it
doesn't
take
any
issue
with
the
fact
that
judge
yankwich's
approach
will
do
what
the
commission
once
done
faster
and
more
comprehensively
than
its
own
approach.
again,
as
i
say,
the
only
basis
on
which
i
can
see
that
judge
yankwich's
decision
is
being
challenged
in
this
court
is
upon
the
basis
of
an
interference
with
a
determination
however
unsound,
that
the
commission
itself
feels
that
it
alone
can
be
termed.
mr.
allen
e.
susman
that's
the
position
expressed
by
mr.
douglas.
i
think
basically
–-
mr.
allen
e.
susman
i
might
point
--
mr.
allen
e.
susman
you're
correct,
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
the
way
you
view
it.
but
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
even
if
the
commission
approach
were
followed,
it
would
still
lead
to
the
same
type
of
court
proceeding
except
more
extended
and
more
interrupted
than
the
procedure
that
judge
yankwich
enunciates.
mr.
allen
e.
susman
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
district
court
is
not
a
rubber
stamp.
it's
not
an
automatic
seal
of
approval.
it
can
view
the
record
as
a
whole
as
judge
yankwich
did
and
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
attention
devoted
by
the
commission
to
mca,
the
manner
in
which
prior
witnesses
had
been
interrogated,
as
i
say,
the
cross-examination
approach
of
a
number
independent
witnesses
designed,
attempted
to
show
--
attempting
to
show
misconduct
or
some
evil
purpose
on
the
part
of
mca,
all
of
these
things
could
lead
the
district
court
and
it
had
the
right
to
do
so
to
lay
down
what
was
in
effect
the
same
sort
of
thing
as
a
protective
order
under
section
30
(b)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
for
example.
i
think
that
the
district
court
has
the
same
basic
power
when
it
comes
to
enforcement
of
subpoena
issued
in
behalf
of
an
administrative
agency.
i
think
the
court
can
use
a
basic
approach
of
fairness,
efficiency,
common
sense,
and
i
think
that
the
law
gives
it
this
right,
and
that's
all
really
that
judge
yankwich
did.
mr.
allen
e.
susman
yes,
sir.
mr.
allen
e.
susman
well,
the
difference
--
mr.
allen
e.
susman
yes,
your
honor.
the
difference
between
annex
a
and
annex
b,
mr.
justice
white,
is
simply
this.
annex
a
asked
for
a
list
of
programs
that
mca
owns.
annex
b
asked
for
--
mr.
allen
e.
susman
no,
your
honor
–-
mr.
allen
e.
susman
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that
that
decision
should
be
made
at
this
time.
i
don't
think
that
issue
is
right
for
adjudication.
mr.
allen
e.
susman
because
the
questioning
hasn't
gone
to
the
point
where
we
really
know
how
deeply
the
commission
intends
to
delve
into
it.
and
until
that's
done
(voice
overlap)
until
we
have
a
record
--
mr.
allen
e.
susman
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
decision
should
be
made
at
all
now.
if
you're
doing
that,
you're
just
throwing
away,
discarding,
and
rejecting
the
approach
to
this
proceeding
that
the
district
court
took
in
this
matter.
you're
saying
in
effect
that
each
item
offered
should
be
the
subject
of
a
separate
court
proceeding
and
i
say
that
in
the
context
of
this
particular
investigatory
hearing,
in
the
manner
in
which
this
particular
hearing
was
conducted,
that
is
not
the
approach
that
should
be
taken.
mr.
allen
e.
susman
i
think
he
did,
your
honor,
but
the
words
that
he
used
was
the
well-grounded
fears
--
mr.
allen
e.
susman
i
think
that's
implicit
in
the
finding
to
which
your
honor
just
referred
--
mr.
allen
e.
susman
that
one
you
just
read.
i
think
--
mr.
allen
e.
susman
well
--
mr.
allen
e.
susman
his
opinion
came
before
the
findings,
obviously,
and
when
it
came
time
to
the
findings,
he
emphasized
the
point
that
he
had
made
in
his
opinion,
which
he
had
put
on
a
suggestion
basis
rather
than
an
--
in
an
adjudicatory
basis
as
presented
by
the
later
order.
but
he
made
it
clear
in
connection
with
the
hearings
on
the
findings
that
he
intended
for
these
--
for
this
testimony
to
be
given
in
confidence
and
to
be
disclosed
at
a
later
date.
now,
he
didn't
explain
that
too
comprehensively
in
his
opinion,
but
he
did
make
it
clear
i
think,
in
connection
with
the
hearings
on
the
findings.
mr.
allen
e.
susman
well,
for
one
thing,
we
disclosed
annex
b
to
judge
yankwich
although
i
don't
think
that
reference
appears
in
the
record
itself.
but
apart
from
that,
we
had
a
review
of
the
entire
transcript
of
the
hearings
up
to
that
date
--
many
thousands
of
pages.
we
were
able
to
demonstrate
to
judge
yankwich
that
this
--
that
this
--
this
particular
kind
of
treatment
being
given
to
mca
was
given
to
no
other
witness.
and
it
was
clear
to
judge
yankwich,
i
feel,
that
this
particular
company
was
being
singled
out
for
a
particularly
hostile
treatment
by
the
commission.
i
think
that
really
was
the
essence
of
judge
yankwich's
feelings
plus
of
course
the
right
to
counsel
point
and
the
fact
that
the
commission
was
really
not
coming
out
with
any
rules
that
anybody
could
intelligently
follow
in
connection
with
this
particular
inquiry.
all
of
these
were
matters
before
judge
yankwich,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
allen
e.
susman
well,
let
me
try
to
answer
the
question
in
another
way.
it
is
true
that
initially
the
confidentiality
of
annex
b
was
a
precipitating
factor
which
led
to
the
district
court
proceeding,
but
it
was
only
one
step
along
the
way.
and
in
connection
with
this
--
with
the
action
and
the
inquiry
made
by
judge
yankwich,
he
looked
at
the
record
as
a
whole
because
he
can
see
that
to
be
the
function
of
the
federal
court
in
connection
with
the
enforcement
of
an
administrative
subpoena
to
look
at
the
record
as
a
whole.
and
that
i
think
is
the
impact
of
the
law
that
has
existed
on
that
point.
it's
recognized
by
the
administrative
procedure
act,
i
think.
it's
recognized
by
the
federal
rules.
it's
recognized
by
the
communications
act
itself.
mr.
allen
e.
susman
i
don't
think
the
rule
is
limited
to
that
extent.
i
know
that's
the
position
taken
by
the
commission
in
this
case
as
a
question
of
arbitrariness
or
not.
it's
never
been
really
enunciated
or
it
shouldn't
be
annunciated
on
that
basis.
it's
a
question
really,
i
think,
of
whether
or
not
the
commission's
approach
is
a
fair
and
proper
one,
protecting
both
the
rights
of
the
public
and
the
rights
of
the
private
parties
involved.
and
incidentally,
it's
that
particular
facet
of
the
matter
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
spoke
of
in
the
pottsville
case,
which
i
think
really
pivots
the
question
that's
before
the
court
right
now.
that's
the
crux
of
the
matter
and
that's
the
question
that
the
united
states
district
court
has
to
answer
in
connection
with
an
enforcement
procedure
before
and
which
judge
yankwich
did
in
fact
answer.
thank
you,
your
honor.
