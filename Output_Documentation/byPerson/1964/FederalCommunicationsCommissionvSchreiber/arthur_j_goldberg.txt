justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
douglas,
before
you
move
into
(inaudible)
at
this
point,
i've
read
this
(inaudible),
how
does
the
regulations
and
the
provision
under
the
investigatory
procedure
(inaudible)
the
person
involved
in
(inaudible)
is
entitled
to
counsel.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
what
would
be
the
(inaudible)
entitled
to
counsel
(inaudible)--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
gather
the
record
is
(inaudible)
investigatory
procedures,
(inaudible)
and
you
said
that
the
counsel
could
make
(inaudible)
result
with
this
counsel
that,
he
happen
to
have
the
permission
(inaudible).
the
record
here
is
--
it
seemed
to
indicate
that
other
than
(inaudible)
that
investigatory
procedure
is
involved,
nevertheless
for
the
production
of
the
record
and
(inaudible)
that
the
right
of
counsel
is
to
comply
to
the
commission
for
(inaudible)
and
the
witness
and
not
the
counsel
will
state
this
objection
is
the
reason
why
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
douglas,
this
--
is
there
any
review
under
your
theory,
a
judicial
review
of
the
commission's
determination
under
its
own
regulations
about
keeping
things
confidential?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
how
would
that
be?
suppose
that
the
commission,
when
a
party
comes
in
and
he
claims
--
he
asked
the
commission
to
invoke
its
rule
about
confidence.
and
the
commission
rules
that
it
will
not
and
directs
him
to
answer.
and
as
soon
as
he
answers,
it's
public,
where
does
he
ever
get
a
judicial
review
under
those
circumstances?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
relates
back
within
to
the
question
i
asked
you
earlier,
if
this
counsel
never
had
a
chance
and
the
layman
or
himself
was
required
and
willing
to
argue
his
reasons
for
confidentiality.
is
this
case
right
for
a
determination
by
us
in
the
question
or
should
it
go
back
under
the
new
theory
of
the
commission
where
it
can
fully
advise
him
(inaudible)?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
susman,
in
the
record
at
page
11,
there's
a
recital
by
the
commission
that
their
hearings
encompass
are
the
testimony
and
other
evidence
concerning
the
activities,
policies,
and
practices
of
a
number
of
hollywood-centered
television
production
companies,
talent
agencies,
talent
representatives,
program
packagers,
and/or
representatives,
west
coast
representatives,
the
national
association
of
broadcasters,
etcetera.
this
would
seem
to
run
at
this
finding
that
the
commission
is
correct,
it
seems
on
contrary
to
what
you
just
told
us
saying
that
your
company
was
the
company.
you
said
others,
and
i
noticed
that
attorney
general
douglas
said
among
others,
the
morrison
agency
testified,
produced
the
same
information
which
is
being
sought
from
you.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
mean
that
(inaudible)
by
not
cooperating
in
the
investigation
arouse
a
certain
amount
of
understandable
suspicion?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
could
you
--
could
you
enlighten
us?
mr.
douglas,
in
answer
to
the
question
i
put
to
him,
said
that
you
in
your
proceeding
before
the
commission,
you
filed
no
affidavit
or
other
document
in
which
you
affirmatively
set
forth
the
basis
on
which
you
claim
the
confidential
treatment
of
this
material.
is
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
mr.
susman,
isn't
there
a
fundamental
difference
though?
isn't
your
position
reduce
itself
to
this,
you
confirm
before
the
commission
response
to
the
subpoena.
you
can
make
the
bold
statement,
the
bold
statement
because
you
say
if
you
reveal
more
it's
going
to
prejudice
trade
secrets.
the
bold
statement,
“this
is
confidential
information”.
at
that
point,
if
you
follow
judge
yankwich
in
what
he
said,
the
commission
must
terminate
the
public
character
of
its
proceedings,
hear
you
in
confidence
and
at
the
end
of
that
hearing,
makes
some
determination
which
is
still
private
and
then
go
to
the
district
court.
as
i
understood,
mr.
douglas,
he's
saying
that
in
order
for
the
commission
to
exercise
its
discretion
which
is
first
called
into
play,
you've
got
to
give
your
claiming
confidence,
your
claiming
confidence,
that
the
commission's
rules
and
its
statutes
says
they
may
conduct
a
public
inquiry
and
you
are
trying
to
carve
out
an
exception.
so
though
--
you're
the
--
you're
the
moving
party,
not
the
commission.
the
commission
normally
has
a
right
to
proceed
publicly.
now,
the
moving
party,
you,
are
taking
the
position
that
without
telling
the
commission
why,
without
documenting
it,
without
giving
it
any
basis,
by
your
bold
claim
of
confidence,
the
commission
must
suspend,
hear
you
privately,
and
then
the
question
is
resolved.
isn't
that
the
difference
between
you?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
how
does
it
differ?
you
have
said
to
me
in
answer
to
the
question
as
mr.
douglas
said
why
didn't
you
file
an
affidavit?
and
you
said
you
can't
really
do
that
because
it
would
prejudice
your
trade
secrets.
so
i
read
the
record
and
your
client
came
in
pursuant
to
legal
advice
and
said,
“i
can't
give
the
schedule
and
the
information
because
it
is
confidential”
period.
and
that's
the
record
before
us.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
not
necessarily,
the
court
--
the
district
court
might
say
putting
as
an
alternate
procedure
which
is
what
i
take
that
the
commission
is
contending.
mr.
gordon
might
say
on
the
record
that
it's
presented
here
that
i
don't
have
any
basis
for
interfering
with
commission's
conduct
of
the
hearing
and
you've
been
refused
to
answer
but
you
have
to
provide
a
basis
for
refusal
to
answer,
and
i
have
no
--
i'm
reviewing
the
commission's
answer.
i'm
not
the
person
who
acts
initially
and
has
to
do
something
on
which
i
--
i
have
to
act.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
i
don't
find
judge
yankwich
referring
to
any
discriminatory
treatment
that
you
have,
and
all
the
things
you're
talking
about
being
singled
out
and
so
on,
judge
yankwich
made
no
findings
about
it.
he
merely
said
on
this
phase
of
the
case,
“i
am
of
the
opinion
that
in
view
of
the
well-grounded
fears
of
the
respondents,
that
testimony
be
given
might
result
in
the
disclosure
of
trade
secrets
of
which
competitors
might
take
advantage
and
so
on”.
now,
that's
the
basis.
he
didn't
find
that
you
were
being
discriminated
against,
singled
out,
did
he?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
that's
on
trade
secrets.
can
you
point
any
finding
of
the
judge
in
his
findings
of
fact
or
opinion
saying
that
the
context
of
the
hearing
was
set
to
view
therefore
or
entitled
to
protection
such
as
you
now
here
argue?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
read
this
merely
to
believe
that
he
thought
that
you
convinced
him
that
if
you
had
a
public
hearing,
that
the
matters
on
schedule
b
would
reveal
some
trade
secret.
he
didn't
criticize
the
commission.
in
fact,
in
the
early
part
of
his
opinion,
he
said
the
commission
did
have
a
right
to
conduct
an
investigation,
well-established,
and
he
sustained
the
commission's
rights.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
that's
in
inquiry.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
susman,
what
did
you
disclose
to
judge
yankwich
that
made
these
apparent
trade
secrets
that
you
did
not
disclose
to
the
commission?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i'm
looking
again
at
your
petition
for
review
before
judge
yankwich
and
i
don't
find
that
you've
raised
this
point
in
the
petition,
the
answer
that
you
filed
in
the
commission's
enforcement
procedure.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but,
isn't
the
rule
of
the
legal
rule
is
applicable
whether
the
commission
acted
arbitrarily
in
the
use
of
this
administrative
subpoena?
