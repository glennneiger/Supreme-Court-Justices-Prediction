mr.
john
w.
douglas
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit.
that
court
had
affirmed
an
order
of
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
california.
the
southern
district
court,
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
california
had
previously
attached
certain
conditions
to
the
enforcement
of
a
subpoena
and
orders
to
testify,
which
had
been
issued
by
the
federal
communications
commission.
the
fcc's
subpoena
and
orders
had
come
during
the
course
of
a
lengthy
commission
investigation
in
the
television
programming.
the
basic
purpose
of
that
investigation
was
to
determine
whether
the
networks,
the
licensees,
or
others
might
be
arbitrarily
restricting
or
excluding
the
broadcast
of
otherwise
meritorious
programs.
as
secondary
and
alive
purposes,
the
commission
wished
to
determine
whether
new
rules
should
be
proposed
to
cope
with
this
important
and
complicated
field
and
also
whether
new
legislations
should
be
suggested
to
the
congress.
at
the
outset
of
the
investigation
itself,
the
commission
directed
that
public
sessions
were
to
be
the
prevailing
practice,
but
the
private
sessions
could
be
ordered,
should
be
ordered
by
the
presiding
officer
if
the
occasion
warranted.
in
the
fall
of
1960,
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
was
served
upon
the
respondent
schreiber.
he
was
then
a
vice
president
of
the
other
respondent
mca.
mca,
an
affiliate
of
music
corporation
of
america,
was
engaged
in
various
phases
of
the
television
industry.
it
was
a
talent
agency
for
performers
both
over
television
and
in
the
movies.
it
was
a
producer
of
shows.
it
was
a
packager
of
shows
and
it
was
a
representative
of
other
packagers.
i
might
say
that
a
packager
is
someone
who
assembles
the
raw
ingredients
which
go
to
comprise
a
performance,
primarily
the
script
and
the
stars,
and
this
assemblage,
if
you
will,
is
then
turned
over
to
the
producer,
whose
job
it
is
to
convert
it
into
something
which
can
be
physically
shown
on
television
screens.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
that's
right.
the
antitrust
action
was
commenced
after
this
investigation
had
gotten
underway
and
ended
in
a
consent
--
mr.
john
w.
douglas
--
decree
in
which
the
mca
decided
to
get
out
of
the
talent
agency
business.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
this
time,
they
were
in
both.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
well
think
it
is,
in
the
sense
that
--
the
anti-trust
suit
is
not
particularly
relevant.
in
fact,
they're
in
the
talent
agency
business
once
because
–-
mr.
john
w.
douglas
it
was
one
the
things
the
investigation
was
about,
the
extent
to
which
the
production
of
television
programs
and
the
authentication
of
them
tied
in
with
the
talent
agency
business.
mr.
schreiber
was
asked
to
bring
with
him
two
lists
of
documents.
one
was
a
list
of
programs
which
mca
had
produced,
and
this
was
turned
over
to
a
commission
without
objection
or
qualification.
the
second
list
was
for
programs
which
mca
had
packaged,
or
in
which
mca
had
participated
as
a
representative
of
the
package.
mr.
schreiber,
at
the
hearing,
took
the
position
that
the
disclosure
of
this
information
would
impose
a
significant
competitive
loss
upon
mca
and
therefore
decline
to
turn
them
over
unless
they
are
received
and
held
under
a
pledge
of
confidential
treatment.
the
presiding
officer
denied
the
request
for
confidential
treatment
and
the
--
the
respondents
then
sought
to
have
this
ruling
overturned
by
filing
a
petition
signed
by
a
counsel
with
the
full
commission.
now,
the
commission
then
denied
the
request
in
the
fairly
careful
opinion
which
is
contained
in
the
record
itself
and
the
--
the
hearing
was
resumed
before
the
presiding
officer
in
los
angeles.
at
the
resumed
hearing,
the
respondents
brought
in
their
request
for
confidentiality.
prior
to
that
time,
they
had
urged
that
confidential
status
be
accorded
only
to
this
list
of
mca-packaged
programs.
at
the
resumed
hearing,
they
requested
that
confidential
treatment
be
accorded
not
merely
to
the
list,
but
to
all
testimony
and
all
evidence
of
any
kind
which
might
be
adduced
from
mr.
schreiber
or
from
the
respondent,
mca,
presumably
from
any
other
official
of
mca.
this
was
denied
by
the
presiding
officer
and
mr.
schreiber
then
declined
to
testify
further
on
the
grounds
that
he
felt
confidential
treatment
should
be
accorded.
he
was
then
excused
from
the
stand
and
the
litigation
shifted
to
the
district
court.
the
commission
filed
a
petition
for
enforcement
with
the
district
court.
and
the
district
court
acting
on
the
record
made
before
the
commission
concluded
that
the
investigation
was
a
proper
and
lawful
one
and
that
the
list
of
packaged
programs
was
both
relevant
and
material
to
the
purposes
of
the
investigation.
and
it
therefore
directed
the
respondents
to
produce
the
lists
to
the
commission
and
also
directed
mr.
schreiber
to
reappear
for
further
questioning.
however,
it
then
went
on
to
attach
the
conditions
which
is
the
subject
of
the
litigations
in
this
court.
conditions
were
first
that
the
list
of
the
packaged
programs
had
to
be
received
in
confidence
and
that
all
future
testimony
of
any
kind
in
response
to
whatever
questions
might
be
asked
was
likewise
to
be
received
in
confidence
by
the
commission,
and
further
that
if
the
commission
wished
to
have
the
confidential
label
taken
off
any
of
these
materials
or
any
of
these
future
testimony
which
might
be
taken.
it
would
have
to
come
back
into
the
district
court
and
demonstrate
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
that
there
was
good
cause
for
making
it
public.
in
so
doing,
the
district
court
committed
a
basic
error
by
ignoring
the
commission's
discretion,
over
this
position
of
request
for
confidential
treatment.
after
all,
section
4
(j)
of
the
communications
act
gives
to
the
commission
broad
powers
in
shaping
its
own
procedural
rules
and
that
language
has
been
given
a
sympathetic
construction
by
this
court
in
the
pottsville
broadcasting
and
wjr
decisions.
and
it
would
seem
that
the
latitude
afforded
the
commission,
by
that
section
and
by
this
court,
is
particularly
desirable
here
where
matters
of
confidentiality
are
concerned.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
yes,
he
is
entitled
to
counsel.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
it's
our
view
--
mr.
john
w.
douglas
your
honor
--
mr.
john
w.
douglas
that
is
not
the
procedure
which
the
commission
follows
now
and
it's
not
the
procedure
which
could
be
followed
under
the
relief
which
we're
requesting
here
insofar
as
future
testimony
is
concerned.
at
the
time
that
the
hearing
was
conducted,
counsel
was
not
permitted
to
make
objections
at
the
time
of
interrogation.
those
rules
were
changed
subsequent
to
the
decision
favorable
to
the
commission
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
therefore
in
our
view,
that
question
of
representation
is
not
involved
here.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
no,
we're
not
challenging
that
part
of
the
order.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
that's
correct
in
accepting
your
view
of
what
the
counsel
should
do
–-
mr.
john
w.
douglas
now
--
mr.
john
w.
douglas
in
all
candor,
i'd
like
to
make
this
one
caveat
and
that
is
with
respect
to
annex
a.
annex
a,
which
is
the
list
of
packaged
programs,
was
one
of
the
issues
before
the
district
court.
the
other
was
the
matter
of
future
testimony.
as
to
annex
a,
it's
our
position
that
the
respondents
had
a
full
opportunity,
even
under
the
commission's
prior
rules
to
make
a
showing
that
they
would
sustain
a
competitive
law.
so,
i
say
that
with
two
reasons,
your
honor.
first,
they
had
an
opportunity
and
availed
themselves
of
it
to
make
a
written
motion
signed
by
counsel
to
the
full
commission.
secondly,
at
the
time
the
hearing
was
resumed,
they
filed
both
a
written
motion
with
the
presiding
officer
and
also
were
permitted
oral
argument
at
that
time
on
the
motion.
but
the
significant
point
in
our
view
is
that
at
no
time
did
they
attach
any
affidavits
to
the
motions
prepared
by
counsel
to
show
wherein
competitive
laws
would
be
injured.
so
that
insofar
as
any
prejudice
might
have
been
suggested
with
respect
to
annex
a,
i
would
say
that
there
were
ample
opportunities
to
have
respondent's
position
put
forth.
now,
so
far
as
the
future
testimony
is
concerned,
there,
all
that's
being
asked
is
that
mr.
schreiber
goes
back
and
testify
before
the
commission,
before
the
presiding
officer,
and
at
that
time
under
the
rules
of
the
commission,
he
will
be
permitted
to
have
counsel
represent
him,
advice
him
and
make
objections.
the
agency
latitude
which
seems
appropriate
here
where
we
deal
with
matters
of
confidentiality
stemmed
from
the
fact
that
such
questions
necessarily
involve
matters
of
expertise,
informed
judgment,
familiarity
with
the
regulated
industry.
you
can't
deal
with
matters
of
competitive
impact,
structure
of
the
industry,
and
the
balancing
of
the
competing
and
private
interests
in
deciding
a
question
of
this
kind
without
the
kind
of
informed
judgment
which
the
commission
is
presumed
to
have,
so
that
the
function
of
the
district
court,
when
it
is
reviewing
action
of
the
commission
where
matters
of
confidentiality
are
concerned
is
not
to
write
on
a
clean
slate.
its
job
is
not
to
decide
which
procedure
it
would
have
followed
had
it
been
sitting
as
the
commission.
rather
its
job
is
simply
to
redo
the
action
of
the
commission
itself
for
possible
abuse
of
discretion.
the
court's
own
discretion
at
the
district
court
level
in
our
view
does
not
come
into
play
unless
and
until
there's
been
a
proper
determination
that
the
commission
has
stepped
outside
reasonable
bounds.
in
this,
the
district
court
did
not
do,
did
not
purport
to
pass
upon
the
discretion
which
the
commission
enjoys,
and
the
court
of
appeals
fell
into
the
same
pitfall.
had
the
district
court
in
deciding
this
case,
passed
upon
the
general
rule
adopted
by
the
commission
at
the
outset
of
this
proceeding,
it
would
have
been
compelled
in
our
view
to
hold
that
the
presumption
favoring
public
disclosure
was
a
reasonable
one.
what
the
commission
did
at
the
outset
of
the
proceedings
was
quite
simple.
it
stated
that
public
proceedings
were
to
be
the
rule,
but
that
private
sessions
could
be
ordered
when
the
occasion
called
for
it.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
well,
he
can
decline
to
answer,
your
honor,
as
he
did
here.
and
then
the
commission
is
compelled
to
go
into
the
district
court
and
demonstrate
that
the
investigation
was
a
proper
one
and
a
lawful
one.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
i
think
after
five
years
your
honor,
it's
very
ripe.
what
we
have
here
is
a
very
simple
record.
what
we
have
here
also
are
--
is
a
future
testimony
as
to
which
the
new
commission
rules
provide
adequate
protection.
the
basic
vice
in
this
order
of
the
district
court
is
saying
that
no
matter
what
testimony
is
given
in
the
future,
that's
going
to
be
received
in
confidence.
that's
a
simple
proposition
and
the
records
complete
on
it.
the
question
is
simply
whether
the
district
court
was
entitled
to
reach
that
conclusion.
when
that
case
goes
back
to
the
commission
and
future
questions
are
asked,
then
it
is
the
prerogative
of
the
counsel
to
object
to
questions,
to
advice
his
client
and
that
will
take
care
of
the
problem
to
which
you've
adverted.
so
far
as
the
annex
a
list
again
is
concerned,
i
think
that
the
respondents
did
have
adequate
opportunity
to
make
their
presentation
to
counsel.
they
failed
to
attach
any
affidavits
with
the
necessary
factual
showing,
and
accordingly
in
our
view,
the
absence
of
counsel
did
not
prejudice
them
with
respect
to
annex
a.
as
to
future
testimony,
the
rules
of
the
commission
will
take
care
of
that.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
that's
correct.
they
had
their
chance
to
make
the
showing
and
haven't
done
so.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
that's
right.
the
testimony
hasn't
been
given
a
chance.
have
the
district
court
passed
upon
this
general
rule
outlined
by
the
commission
at
the
start
of
its
investigation,
we
feel
that
it
would
have
been
compelled
to
conclude
that
it
was
a
reasonable
one
and
i
say
that
for
three
separate
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
public
disclosure
does
tend
to
build
a
better
record
because
it
tends
to
elicit
comments
from
interested
parties
and
silence
of
course
doesn't
permit
that.
secondly,
a
public
disclosure,
an
open
record
will
encourage
industry
acceptance
of
any
future
rule
which
may
subsequently
develop
and
this
was
an
idle
speculation
on
the
commission's
part.
the
commission
in
the
order
instituting
the
investigation
specifically
stated
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
investigation
was
to
decide
whether
new
rules
should
be
proposed.
if
such
rule
should
have
been
proposed
and
had
been
adopted,
industry
understanding
would
be
important
in
the
total
regulatory
scheme.
and
of
course,
under
the
commission's
congressional
charter,
it's
required
to
make
an
annual
report
to
the
congress.
that
the
commission
can
cite
to
matters
in
the
public
record,
it's
in
a
better
position
to
make
a
more
complete
and
meaningful
report.
so
that
all
these
elements
merely
point
to
the
same
general
preference,
for
disclosure
which
the
act
permits
and
which
the
commission
directed
--
prevail
at
the
start
of
the
hearings.
since
the
commission's
rule
on
disclosure
was
reasonable,
there
remains
in
our
view
basically
only
the
question
whether
the
respondents
had
made
out
a
case
here
as
to
why
an
exception
should
have
been
made
for
them.
they
were
entitled
to
make
such
a
showing.
in
our
view,
they
fell
far
short
of
it.
they
made
no
showing
whatsoever
with
respect
to
damage
it
might
stem
from
possible
future
testimonies,
and
there
was
no
way
they
could.
questions
hadn't
been
asked,
no
lines
of
inquiry
have
been
marked
out
and
the
only
way
in
which
the
district
court's
decision
in
this
regard
can
be
supported
is
on
the
assumption
that
every
question,
every
answer
to
that
question,
and
every
document
that
might
be
subpoenaed
in
the
future
would
necessarily
involve
not
only
important
trade
secrets,
but
that
the
private
interest
stemming
from
competitive
laws
in
disclosure
would
outweigh
the
public
interest
elements
favoring
disclosure.
i
think
that
to
recite
that
proposition
which
is
essential
to
support
district
court's
blanket
non-disclosure
rule
furnishes
its
own
reputation.
but
i
like
to
point
out
one
element
which
seems
to
me
that
clenched
this
particular
point.
annex
a,
which
has
the
list
of
mca-produced
programs,
was
turned
over
voluntarily.
this
is
the
list
of
programs
which
mca
itself
had
produced.
now,
under
the
district
court's
order,
however,
mr.
schreiber
couldn't
be
questioned
about
that
list
except
in
confidential
sessions.
had
mca
felt
that
there
were
business
secrets
involved,
presumably
they
would
have
objected
to
turning
over
annex
a
as
it
had
objected
to
turning
over
annex
b.
it
did
not
do
so
and
therefore
i
think
the
fact
that
the
district
court's
order
would
reach
questions
concerning
the
very
document
which
mca
turned
over,
shows
how
extreme
and
the
same
extent,
how
baseless
the
district
court's
blanket
order
really
is.
and
finally,
so
far
as
the
annex
a
list
is
concerned,
there
was
no
showing
with
respect
to
any
specific
injury.
mca
at
that
time
was
engaged
in
a
variety
of
phases
of
the
television
industry.
it
was
an
agent,
it
was
a
producer,
it
was
a
packager,
it
was
a
representative
of
packagers.
it
competed
with
the
networks,
with
television
stations,
with
other
producers,
other
agents,
and
it
had
a
variety
of
different
phases
of
business.
there's
no
indication
in
any
of
the
materials
supplied
by
mca
as
to
what
phase
of
its
business
it
was
concerned
about,
whether
it
was
concerned
about
its
agency
business,
whether
it
was
concerned
about
its
production
business,
or
what
its
relationships
were
that
it
felt
might
be
damaged.
and
no
indications
as
to
how
much
business
would
be
lost
or
the
general
order
of
business
and
as
a
practical
proposition,
it's
difficult
to
see
how
a
list
of
programs
which
presumably
are
--
which
are
the
things
which
mca
was
showing,
how
those
could
be
considered
trade
secrets.
now,
they
might
be
trade
secrets.
it's
conceivable
that
they
might
be,
although
we
have
no
basis
to
that
effect,
but
it
was
up
to
the
respondents
to
come
in
and
show
why
they
fell
into
that
category.
they
didn't
do
so
although
they
had
adequate
opportunity
to
do
so
on
the
occasions
which
counsel
was
permitted
to
make
written
presentations
as
well
as
oral
arguments.
and
i
should
like
to
close
this
aspect
of
my
argument
to
quoting
that
part
of
the
district
court's
original
opinion
which
i
think
shed
some
light
on
a
rather
tentative
view
which
the
district
court
at
least
at
one
point
had,
as
to
the
nature
of
the
trade
secrets
involved.
at
page
116
of
the
record,
district
court
said,
“however,
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
in
view
of
the
well-grounded
fears
of
the
testimony
--
of
the
respondents,
that
the
testimony
to
be
given
might
resolve
in
disclosure
of
trade
secrets
of
which
competitors
might
take
advantage”.
and
the
court
of
appeals,
in
similar
vein,
on
page
144
of
the
transcript
stated
that
the
appellees,
in
effect,
should
be
protected
against
the
improvident
disclosure
of
possible
valuable
trade
secrets.
but
far
more
sufficient,
far
more
powerful
showing
is
required
to
support
confidential
treatment.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
before
the
luncheon
recess,
i
may
have
confused
the
court
with
respect
to
the
difference
between
annex
a
and
annex
b.
annex
a
in
the
subpoena
was
for
the
lists
of
programs
which
mca
had
produced.
that
was
the
list
which
was
turned
over
without
objection.
annex
b
was
the
list
of
programs
which
mca
had
packaged
or
in
which
mca
had
acted
as
the
representative
of
the
package,
and
that
was
the
list
which
was
not
turned
over.
there
is
a
thread
which
runs
throughout
the
respondent's
brief
to
the
effect
that
somehow
mca
was
singled
out
for
hostile
and
discriminatory
treatment
by
the
commission.
of
course
mca's
testimony
comprises
a
very
small
part
of
the
total
record
of
some
12,000
pages
which
has
been
amassed
today.
the
networks
were
called,
licensees
were
called,
other
talent
agencies,
and
other
producers,
so
that
mca
was
not
singled
out
to
any
particular
attention.
it
is
true
that
the
commission
accorded
confidential
treatment
to
certain
information
provided
by
the
other
--
some
of
the
other
companies,
but
there
is
world
of
difference
between
the
types
of
information
which
was
given
confidential
treatment
by
the
commission
than
that
which
was
involved
here.
confidential
treatment
was
accorded
to
financial
data,
cost
data
and
other
types
of
statistical
material.
here
on
the
other
hand,
no
such
information
was
involved.
all
that
was
sought
was
a
list
of
programs
and
of
course
confidential
treatment
was
not
accorded
by
the
commission,
with
respect
to
any
future
testimony,
such
as
respondents
sought
and
secured
in
the
district
court.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
annex
a
was
turned
over,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
yes,
and
they
made
no
showing
of
a
factual
nature,
no
affidavits
were
submitted
to
support
their
request
for
confidential
treatment
of
annex
b.
none.
and
i
think
it's
significant
in
this
respect
that
william
morris,
which
is
a
rival
talent
agency
of
mca
did
turn
over
a
list
of
programs
where
william
morris
have
represented
the
packagers
and
this
was
volun
--
this
was
turned
over
in
response
to
a
subpoena.
nevertheless,
the
respondents
did
not
see
fit
to
distinguish
between
their
list,
which
they
didn't
wish
to
turn
over,
and
the
morris
list
which
was,
as
i
say,
turned
over
by
that
rival
agency.
similarly,
they
made
no
effort
to
distinguish
between
the
confidential
nature
as
they
alleged
with
respect
to
the
annex
b
documents,
which
they
turned
--
which
they
did
not
wish
to
turn
over,
and
the
annex
a
list,
which
they
did
turn
over.
so
that
i
think
here,
one
can
also
see
that
there
was
a
total
failure
to
meet
the
initial
standard
of
showing
that
there
was
some
kind
of
substantial
injury
to
private
interest
concerned.
had
they
made
such
a
showing?
then
of
course
the
question
would
have
arisen
whether
the
public
interests
involved
in
a
disclosure
on
the
record
of
this
information
was
outweighed
by
those
private
interests,
but
there
was
no
showing
of
private
injury
by
the
respondents.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
the
--
mr.
john
w.
douglas
they
could
take
that
position
before
the
commission
and
the
procedure
would
then
be
for
the
commission
to
move
in
district
court
to
have
their
own
orders
to
testify
in
course.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
and
it
would
be
up
to
commission
to
decide
how
they
wish
to
proceed.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
yes,
i
--
i
had
stated
that
earlier.
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
the
respondents
have
had
an
adequate
showing
about
--
opportunity
to
make
a
showing
about
annex
b
and
the
record
has
been
made
before
the
commission
–-
mr.
john
w.
douglas
no,
and
i
--
mr.
john
w.
douglas
that's
correct.
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
i
thought
was
directed
to
future
questions.
it
might
be
made
by
commission
counsel
at
resumed
hearings.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
if
the
court
please,
the
district
court
specifically
held
that
the
alleged
failure
of
the
commission
to
promulgate
adequate
ground
rules
to
cover
the
proceeding
did
not
prejudice
the
respondents,
that's
conclusion
ten
on
page
128
of
the
record.
and
that
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
is
not
before
the
court
in
our
view.
suggestion
was
made
that
the
procedure
outlined
by
the
district
court
made
a
great
deal
of
sense.
we
would
dispute
that
proposition,
but
the
basic
question
is
who's
going
to
decide
what
the
proper
procedure
is?
is
it
going
to
be
the
district
court?
or
is
it
going
to
be
the
commission?
it's
our
view
that
the
commission
has
the
right
to
frame
procedural
rules
and
rules
of
this
kind
so
long
as
they
stay
within
the
realm
of
reasonableness.
district
court
or
this
court
might
believe
that
there
was
some
different
procedure
which
if
it
were
framing
rules,
would
make
a
great
deal
of
sense.
but
the
commission
is
charged
with
that
responsibility
and
it
is
the
function
of
the
district
court
not
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
commission
but
simply
to
review
it
for
possible
abuse
of
discretion.
there
were
no
findings
in
the
district
court
on
alleged
discrimination
and
handling
of
mca
or
the
respondent
schreiber.
no
suggestion
that
this
absence
of
findings,
such
findings
should
have
been
made
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
accordingly,
this
argument
also
we
don't
think
is
a
proper
issue
here.
as
far
as
the
purpose
of
the
investigation
is
concerned,
district
court
held
that
the
investigation
was
for
lawful
purpose
and
this
was
upheld
also
by
the
court
of
appeals.
basic
question
in
our
minds
therefore
for
this
court
to
resolve
is
simply
whether
district
court's
general
presumption
favoring
disclosure
was
a
reasonable
one.
we
think
it
was
and
secondly,
whether
the
respondents
had
made
an
adequate
showing
that
takes
them
out
from
under
the
operation
of
that
general
rule.
i
think
no
said
showing
was
made
and
that
it's
not
sufficient
for
someone
to
come
in
and
say,
“if
i
make
any
objections,
they
are
going
to
reveal
confidentiality.
it's
perfectly
possible
as
with
request
for
protective
orders
in
the
district
court
in
civil
discovery,
to
come
forward
with
some
kind
of
generalized
descriptions
which
would
place
the
information
sought
in
some
kind
of
context
where
the
court
could
properly
pass
upon
them.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
we're
going
have
an
additional
hearing
so
far
as
all
future
questions
are
concerned.
procedure
will
be
as
the
questions
develop
and
no
one
knows
what
the
questions
will
be
at
this
time
for
the
counsel
to
object,
and
for
the
commission
then
to
pass
upon
the
request
for
confidentiality
at
that
time.
insofar
as
annex
b
is
concerned,
we
believe
that
a
record
has
been
made
on
that
point
and
that
that
particular
issue
is
right
for
a
decision
here.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
annex
a
has
been
produced
already
and
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
mr.
john
w.
douglas
they
went
a
lot
of
farther
than
that
mr.
justice
white.
they
were
cited
--
at
least
three
elements
favoring
disclosure.
one
of
those
was
the
importance
of
encouraging
others
to
come
forward
to
build
a
complete
record.
this
was
an
investigatory
proceeding
and
the
building
of
such
record
is
important.
they
also
–-
mr.
john
w.
douglas
yes,
on
the
petition
to
review,
the
decision
of
the
presiding
officer,
they
went
forward
at
some
length
–-
mr.
john
w.
douglas
not
in
our
view.
they
just
--
the
district
court
just
went
ahead
and
said,
“this
is
the
way
we
think
it
should
be
handled”,
and
didn't
even
purport
to
analyze
the
reasons
given
by
the
commission
or
to
evaluate
them
as
against
the
claims
of
the
private
litigant.
