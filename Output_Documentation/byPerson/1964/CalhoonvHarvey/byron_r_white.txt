justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
scribner,
what
the
--
what
is
the
--
is
there
a
--
is
the
right
to
nominate
guaranteed
somewhere
in
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
answer
that,
the
right
to
nominate?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
would
you
confine
title
i
or
section
101
to
--
just
the
equality
face
or
is
it
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
scope
of
the
right
itself,
under
title
iv,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
first
of
all,
what
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what
is
involved
in
the
right
to
nominate
for
example
to
the
--
is
it
reasonable
to
say
that
you
can
nominate
only
yourself?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
--
yes,
but
what
if
that
question
is
told
to
--
who
solves
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
section
101
--
justice
byron
r.
white
section
101
says
that
people
still
have
the
equal
right
to
nominate.
you
have
recited
the
equal
but
what
about
the
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
says
that
--
he
says
the
section
not
only
guarantees
equalities
but
it
guarantees
a
right
to
nominate
and
the
right
to
nominate
is
more
--
it
certainly
includes
more
than
the
right
to
nominate
yourself
--
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
question
right
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
necessarily
but
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
you
don't
think
he
should
have
met
it
all?
that
--
do
you
think
if
that
--
the
scope
of
the
right
is
that
the
reasonableness
of
the
nomination
--
the
definition
of
the
nomination
or
the
right
to
nominate
is
for
the
secretary?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
just
didn't
get
to
that
part?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
there
was
no
right
to
nominate
in
any
one?
what
if
the
union
procedure
is
self-perpetuating
board
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
then,
they
just
didn't
have
a
right
to
nominate
anybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
--
yes,
but
what's
the
source
of
the
right
in
somebody
to
nominate,
is
it
101?
