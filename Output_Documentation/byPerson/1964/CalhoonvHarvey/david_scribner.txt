mr.
david
scribner
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
here
affects
the
interpretation
of
the
labor-management
reporting
and
disclosure
act,
insofar
as
it
relates
to
one
specific
issue
and
that
is
the
question
as
to
whether
the
district
court
on
the
complaint
of
a
private
party
that
is
a
member
of
the
union
may
it
make
a
determination
assuming
jurisdiction
therefore
in
respect
to
the
reasonableness
of
eligibility
qualifications
for
candidacy
to
union
office,
the
far
reaching
nature
of
the
ultimate
determination
of
this
is
apparent
because
of
the
many
thousands
of
union
elections
that
go
on
everyday
in
the
weekends
throughout
the
year.
if
the
question
--
if
the
answer
into
this
question
is
that
the
district
court
may
assume
initial
jurisdiction
that
is
on
the
complaint
of
a
private
party
and
before
an
election
has
been
concluded
and
obviously,
every
member
of
any
union
at
any
time
prior
to
an
election
may
attack
candidacy
qualifications
under
the
labor-management
reporting
and
disclosure
act.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
answer
is
no,
as
i
suggests
and
as
the
united
states
suggests
in
its
memorandum
to
this
court
which
was
asked
for
by
the
court,
then
the
relief
to
be
obtained
by
a
member
who
seeks
relief
in
respect
to
eligibility
requirements
would
be
to
make
a
complaint
as
the
act
requires
to
the
secretary
of
labor
under
certain
circumstances
and
under
certain
conditions,
the
secretary
of
labor
would
then
make
the
necessary
investigation
and
under
the
circumstances
set
forth
in
the
act
would
then
file
a
complaint
in
the
name
of
the
secretary
of
labor
to
the
district
court
for
--
to
set
aside
the
election
which
is
under
attack
and
to
secure
a
new
election
under
the
offices
and
supervision
of
the
secretary
of
labor.
now,
the
scheme
of
the
act
as
the
petitioner
sees,
it
is
a
fairly
simple
one,
title
iv
of
the
act
which
was
initially
the
subject
of
the
kennedy
urban
bill
which
initiated
the
entire
legislative
process
in
1959,
in
which
lead
to
the
act
itself,
provides
for
almost
every
manner
relating
to
the
election
process.
there
more
specifically,
the
act
provides
and
particularly
in
section
401
(e),
among
other
things
that
every
member
in
good
standing
of
the
union
has
the
right
to
be
a
candidate
for
election
to
union
office
subject
to
reasonable
qualifications
uniformly
imposed
by
the
union.
that
is
specific
--
those
are
the
words
of
the
act
itself.
on
the
other
hand,
title
i,
101
(a)
of
the
act
which
is
essentially
the
so-called
bill
of
rights
which
had
been
introduced
by
senator
mcclellan,
as
the
result
with
his
investigation,
provides
that
every
member
of
the
union
has
the
equal
right
to
nominate.
enforcement
under
those
circumstances,
that
is
to
enforce
the
equal
right
to
nominate
is
on
--
is
in
the
district
court
upon
the
complaint
of
the
member
aggrieved.
now
the
respondents
in
this
proceeding,
members
of
the
union,
nominated
themselves
under
the
union
procedures
that
i
will
demonstrate
in
a
moment
and
were
then
disqualified
by
the
credentials
committee
of
the
union
after
their
nominations
had
been
received
because
they
did
not
meet
the
requirement
of
a
certain
amount
of
seatime.
many
unions,
and
frankly,
most
unions
that
i
know
of
and
particularly
in
the
maritime
industry
have
provisions
for
a
certain
amount
of
employment
as
the
condition
for
candidacy
in
order
to
have
people
who
would
be
officers,
who
will
be
familiar
with
the
running
of
the
union
and
the
industry
itself
and
the
problems
of
the
individual
members
and
the
like.
they
had
nominated
themselves
only
for
the
office
of
patrolman
and
for
nothing
else.
mr.
david
scribner
a
patrolman
is
like
a
representative
of
the
union
at
the
ports.
he
meets
the
ship.
he
takes
care
of
all
the
problems
of
the
men
as
they
come
in
from
sea,
as
they
come
off
the
ship
and
then
sees
to
it
that
their
problems
are
met
through
the
union,
gives
them
advice
and
guidance
is
really
the
most
important.
i
would
consider
--
probably
the
most
important
single
union
representative
or
at
least
as
important
as
almost
anybody
that
i
know
of.
well,
he's
not
really
like
a
steward
because
he's
a
full
time
employee
of
the
union
or
elected
official
of
the
union
but
he's
not
like
a
steward
because
a
steward
normally
is
a
member
--
is
a
working
man
in
the
shop
and
is
--
has
been
elected
by
the
immediate
persons
in
his
department
or
division.
mr.
david
scribner
well,
there
are
different
divisions
there.a
patrolman
who
is
known
as
a
patrolman
is
also
a
business
agent
for
the
particular
port
to
--
who
has
a
different
status,
but
more
or
less
serves
in
the
same
capacity.
mr.
david
scribner
he
can
nominate
himself.
he
may
nominate
himself.
at
least,
that's
the
way
the
provision
raised.
we're
not
contesting
at
this
moment
whether
that
was
permissive
or
not
permissive.
i
think
in
the
posture
of
the
case
let's
assume,
i
think
the
record
is
that
at
this
moment.
it
happens
not
to
be
the
fact,
but
it
is
not
--
we're
not
raising
that
at
this
moment.
we'll
say
that
he
can
only
nominate
himself.
every
member
of
the
union
may
nominate
himself.
the
qualifications
as
we
see
it
go
to
an
entirely
different
question
because
if
the
issue
were
that
any
member
can
nominate
persons
who
are
qualified
then
we're
mixing
two
questions
as
i
think
the
circuit
court
did.
what
i
suggest
the
circuit
court
did
was
to
mix
really
apples
and
pears
in
this
sense.
the
apple
is
the
equal
right
to
nominate
which
is
a
nondiscriminatory
right
to
participate
in
the
nominating
procedure.
let
me
give
one
example
of
the
--
of
a
discriminatory
practice.
assume
particularly
here
where
you
have
seamen,
these
are
marine
engineers,
who
travel
all
over
the
world
and
maybe
on
ships
a
good
part
of
the
year.
if
the
requirement
was
that
in
order
to
make
a
nomination,
a
member
of
the
union
had
to
appear
at
a
union
meeting,
let
say
in
portland,
oregon,
when
he
maybe
in
japan
or
a
large
number
of
the
membership
maybe
all
throughout
the
world
and
if
he
doesn't
appear
at
that
meeting
he
cannot
make
a
nomination,
i
would
say
that
is
exactly
the
kind
of
thing
that
was
contemplated
by
the
right,
the
equal
right
to
nominate.
in
other
words
that
process,
the
nomination
process.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
question
of
qualifications
which
i
consider
to
be
the
pear
in
this
situation,
were
to
be
merged
as
the
second
circuit
did
with
the
apple
and
put
them
in
a
fruit
bowl
and
then
say,
since
they're
all
fruit,
the
pear
is
the
apple,
that
is
the
pear
being
the
equal
qualification
has
to
be
considered
if
with
the
apple
itself
and
somehow
we
have
a
denial
of
an
equal
right
to
nominate,
in
other
words,
an
apple
--
instead
of
an
apple
and
a
pear,
that
would
the
effect
of
it.
there
are
two
separate
and
distinct
matters.
in
fact,
that
is
exactly
the
way
the
congress
considered
it.
now,
the
provision
--
mr.
david
scribner
well
first
on
the
fact
sir
and
at
the
--
record
would
show
that
any
person
who
had
previously
held
any
office
whatsoever
or
any
time
paid
--
elected
or
paid,
would
be
eligible
for
that.
i
would
say
that
the
question
there
maybe
the
unreasonableness
of
the
eligibility
qualification
which
is
exactly
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
secretary
of
labor
would
have
to
look
into.
now
in
one
union,
it
might
mean
a
thousand
people
out
of,
let's
say
2500.
in
another
union
under
whatever
the
circumstances
are,
the
number
of
locals
for
instance,
the
number
of
officers
within
each
local,
it
might
be
only
ten.
now,
in
one
case
that
might
be
completely
unreasonable.
in
another
case
it
might
be
completely
reasonable.
now,
whether
it
was
discriminatory
is
not
the
issue
because
it
might
be
discriminatory
and
unreasonable.
but
the
question
as
to
the
equal
right
to
nominate
was
one
that
was
directed
to
the
narrow
question
of
the
right
to
nominate.
now,
there
has
been
a
suggestion
that
perhaps
we
look
at
what
maybe
considered
be
effectiveness
of
the
nomination
and
i
imagine
that
would
be
a
general
concern.
is
the
nomination
an
effective
nomination,
what
uses
there
to
nominate
if
ultimately
there
can't
be
an
election.
but
if
we
do
that,
we're
destroying
the
whole
scheme
of
the
act
because
only
in
section
401
(e),
that
is
in
that
section
which
relates
to
the
whole
election
process
in
the
sense
that
the
secretary
of
labor
is
to
look
at
every
aspects
of
it
and
then
make
his
determination
as
the
result
of
his
expertise,
his
experience,
his
knowledge
of
the
union,
his
understanding
of
the
particular
impact,
a
particular
qualification
which
would
have
in
a
particular
situation
which
might
be
entirely
different
in
another
situation.
on
the
other
hand,
the
question
of
the
equal
right
to
nominate
itself
as
i
said
before
is
one
that
goes
to
the
making
of
nomination
and
the
kind
of
things
that
i
suggested
before.
another
instance
of
that
would
be
simply,
suppose
in
a
nomination
meeting,
you
had
a
situation
where
only
certain
members
could
go
into
that
meeting.
nobody
else
could
walk
into
the
meeting,
a
sergeant-at-arms
stands
at
the
meeting
and
by
the
way
there
were
some
instances
of
this
that
were
referred
to
by
senator
mcclellan
during
the
course
of
the
hearing.
and
i
suspect
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
he
had
in
mind.
you
have
a
meeting
and
50
men
out
of
let's
say
150
men
who
may
want
to
attend
the
meeting
are
not
permitted
to
enter
into
the
meeting,
a
nominating
meeting.
they
would
have
been
denied
an
equal
right
to
nominate.
if
the
two
were
to
be
equated,
that
is
a
question
of
eligibility
qualifications
with
the
right
to
nominate,
then
every
qualifications
in
every
union
would
be
subject
to
a
determination
by
a
district
court
initially
on
the
complaint
of
an
individual
and
without
the
intervention
of
a
secretary
of
labor
and
the
application
of
his
expertise
and
knowledge
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
a
so-called
effective
right
to
nominate
which
in
the
last
analysis
would
be
an
equal
right
to
nominate.
that's
the
way
the
argument
on
the
other
side
goes.
mr.
david
scribner
an
equal
right
to
nom
--
mr.
david
scribner
well,
the
--
in
section
401
(e)
the
same
section
that
has
the
qualifications,
they
talked
about
a
reasonable
opportunity.
every
member
should
have
a
reasonable
opportunity
for
a
nomination
or
there
shall
be
a
reasonable
opportunity
for
a
nomination.
mr.
david
scribner
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
david
scribner
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
congressional
history
supports
that.
mr.
david
scribner
the
scope
of
the
right
itself
as
it
involves
all
the
aspects
of
the
election
procedure
--
mr.
david
scribner
--
would
be
entitled.
mr.
david
scribner
well,
it
so
happens
that
the
secretary
--
mr.
david
scribner
the
secretary
of
labor
would
solve
that.
on
the
other
hand,
i
might
say
this.
this
is
one
of
the
more
difficult
--.
mr.
david
scribner
--
question.
mr.
david
scribner
i
would
say
that
under
those
circumstances,
you
might
have
a
sort
of
interplay
between
the
two
sections.
now,
the
question
is
whether
it's
equal
and
i
say
equal
since
that's
the
term
was
used
there.
it
could
have
meaning
only
because
it's
there.
and
as
a
matter
fact,
the
legislative
history
indicates
quite
clearly
those
who
spoke
about
it
that
they
were
talking
about
a
nondiscriminatory
right
to
nominate.
it
wasn't
just
a
question
of
a
right
to
nominate,
a
nondiscriminatory
right
to
nominate.
if
you
have
as
we
have
in
this
instance
a
provision
which
permits
everyone
of
the
6,000
members
of
the
union
to
nominate
himself,
that
is
an
equal
right
to
nominate.
i
might
say
the
secretary
of
labor
that
he
himself
held
--
mr.
david
scribner
well,
i'll
be
frank
to
say
mr.
justice
white
that
on
that
particular
subject,
there
maybe
a
question.
now,
i
tell
you
i‘ll
explain
--
mr.
david
scribner
--
why
i
say
that.
mr.
david
scribner
no.
no,
not
necessarily
at
all
sir.
mr.
david
scribner
as
i
--
mr.
david
scribner
its
here
only
in
respect,
if
its
here
at
all.
it's
here
only
in
respect
to
the
issue
of
self-nomination.
now,
the
district
court
recognized
that
and
the
district
court
put
it
this
way.
the
district
court
said
that
all
of
these
relates
to
the
election
process
and
it
should
be
under
section
401
(e)
and
subject
to
the
action
of
the
secretary
of
labor.
then
the
district
court
went
on
to
say,
however,
even
if
the
question
of
self-nomination
is
one
that
might
come
within
the
area
of
section
101
(a)
(1)
involving
the
equal
right
to
nominate.
i
consider
it
to
be
a
perfectly
reasonable
type
of
nomination
procedure.
now,
that's
the
way
he
met
that.
mr.
david
scribner
well,
not
only
don't
i
think
so
but
i
don't
think
the
second
circuit
thought
so.
because
the
second
circuit
did
not
rule
on
the
basis
of
the
self-nomination
procedure
was
a
restrictive
procedure
standing
alone.
mr.
david
scribner
what
they
decided
was
that
a
combination
of
the
qualification
procedure
as
well
as
the
self-nomination
procedure
in
itself
caused
what
it
considered
to
be
a
denial
of
the
equal
rights
to
nominate.
and
there
are
--
mr.
david
scribner
well
--
mr.
david
scribner
oh,
i
don't
--
i
would
have
no
problem
at
all
if
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
scribner
well,
the
basic
source
of
the
right,
i
would
say
isn't
401
(e)
because
that
relates
as
i
said
to
the
entire
election
process
and
i
think
that
is
the
intent
of
congress.
on
the
other
hand,
where
there's
been
a
discriminatory
denial
of
the
right.
in
other
words,
section
101
(a)
(1)
does
not
go
to
substantive
right.
it
does
not
establish
substantive
rights
and
i
think
this
was
the
intent.
what
101
(a)
(1)
does
is
to
prevent
or
attempt
to
prevent
discriminatory
application.
in
other
words,
discriminatory
denial
because
if
you
see
the
whole
concept
as
it
set
forth
in
title
iv,
you
will
see
that
the
intent
was
to
have
the
secretary
of
labor
take
the
package
and
make
his
determinations
as
required
by
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
situations
with
a
certain
guide.
there
were
still
another
very
significant
aspect
of
title
iv
which
is
not
in
title
i,
which
was
served
further,
title
i,
the
need
for
the
secretary
of
labor.
first
of
all,
you
have
the
expertise
as
i
said
and
the
information
and
the
background
of
the
secretary
involved.
and
it's
mandatory.
it
must
go
to
the
secretary
of
labor
and
then
the
secretary
of
labor,
after
an
investigation
upon
a
finding
of
probable
cause
that
a
violation
exists
can
make
an
application
to
the
district
court
for
the
necessary
relief.
second
--
mr.
david
scribner
this
case
was
initiated
in
1963
and
it
was
not
there,
sir.
mr.
david
scribner
yes,
indeed
mr.
david
scribner
yes,
indeed.
mr.
david
scribner
exactly.
mr.
david
scribner
exactly.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
interesting
that
the
congressional
--
the
legislative
history
shows
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
having
that
issue
of
qualifications
particularly
go
to
the
secretary
of
labor,
is
so
that
there
would
be
a
minimum
interference,
number
one,
with
the
activity
of
the
union
in
its
normal
application
and
goodness
knows,
there
was
a
very
substantial
interference
by
the
very
adoption
of
the
act.
whether
it's
right
or
wrong,
it's
not
an
issue
at
this
moment.
then
the
other
part
of
it
was
the
exhaustion
requirements,
and
i'm
really
relating
to
the
statements
that
you
made
mr.
justice
goldberg.
a
member
under
401
(e)
must
exhaust
his
administrative
remedy.
under
101
(a),
he
maybe
required
to
exhaust
the
administrative
remedies
and
the
second
circuit
in
the
detroy
case
in
which
cert
was
denied
a
year
has
said
that
there
is
not
mandatory
in
the
101.
but
there's
no
question
about
a
being
mandatory
in
the
401.
now,
why
do
i
advert
to
that?simply
because
the
legislative
history
show
that
he
reason
for
the
mandatory
exhaustion
was
that
the
union
is
to
be
given
the
opportunity
to
make
the
necessary
corrections
to
give
it
the
opportunity
to
consider
the
problem
before
it
find
itself
in
a
court
proceeding
and
possibly
under
injunctive
sanction.
now,
in
this
particular
situation
and
to
which
you
refer
mr.
justice
goldberg,
while
the
secretary
was
investigating
the
pacific
coast
district
and
these
very
areas
is
the
same
union.
its
pacific
coast
district
of
the
national
marine
engineers'
beneficial
association,
the
organization
here
directly
involved
in
this
suit
is
district
i,
that's
specific
--
that's
the
east
coast
in
effect
and
the
like.
now,
it's
interesting
to
observe
since
the
secretary
of
labor
has
referred
to
it.
i
--
with
your
permission,
feel
free
to
make
a
comment
on
that.
the
fact
is
that
the
union
has
considered
that
the
national
union
which
is
not
involved
here
has
considered
the
impact
of
what
it
is
the
secretary
of
labor
has
done
and
has
made
as
of
now.
and
this
is
quite
a
few
months
ago,
certain
specific
changes
in
order
to
eliminate
any
possible
questions
in
respect
to
the
major
issues.
mr.
david
scribner
exactly
sir.
it's
in
the
footnote.
it's
on
the
--
that
page
and
then
the
footnote
itself.
so
that
here
is
a
perfect
illustration
of
why
it
is
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
every
time
there
was
a
question
about
an
illegibility
qualification
and
they're
always
is,
it
maybe
good
or
bad
but
there's
always
somebody
who
may
think
it's
bad.
and
this
would
serve
as
an
unwarranted
encouragement
not
contemplated
by
law
for
every
member,
at
any
member,
at
anytime
while
an
election
is
in
process
and
before
has
been
concluded
to
go
to
the
district
court
and
say
i
have
a
complaint
under
101
(a)
(1)
because
in
affect
the
qualification
goes
to
the
question
of
my
equal
right
to
nominate.
i
have
an
equal
right
to
nominate
anybody
i
want.
the
qualification
limits
my
right
in
the
sense
that
it
limits
the
candidates.
the
number
of
candidates
whom
i
should
have
a
right
to
nominate
but
of
course,
even
senator
barry
goldwater,
who
was
the
proponents
for
the
view
that
there
should
be
all
kinds
of
legal
sanctions
against
the
activities
of
unions
and
in
this
particular
area
said
in
complaint.
during
the
course
of
the
debate
and
he
was
a
member
of
the
conference
committee.
he
said,
section
101
(a)
(1),
and
this
is
in
our
briefs,
does
not
give
anyone
the
right
of
candidacy.
he
says,
401
(a)
does
--
401
(e)
rather
and
that
goes
only,
the
complaint
there
can
only
go
to
the
secretary
of
labor
and
he
insisted
that
it
would
have
been
proper
to
have
done
it
that
way.
in
fact,
secretary
goldwater's
bill
which
he
introduced
during
the
early
phases
of
1959
and
after
the
kennedy
urban
ville
had
been
introduced,
provided
that
section
--
the
rights
under
section
which
is
now
section
401
(e),
that
is
the
whole
eligibility
--
the
whole
election
process
provision
should
be
enforceable
either
at
the
instance
of
a
member
in
the
district
court
at
any
time
or
through
the
secretary
of
labor.
now,
it's
also
curious
that
senator
mcclellan
who
was
the
proponent
for
the
basic
legislation
which
is
here
involved.
when
he
introduced
his
bill
of
rights
on
april
20
--
april
22nd,
1959
after
the
senate
bill
had
already
been
adopted
which
did
not
contain
the
bill
of
rights
at
that
time.
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
senator
mcclellan
introduced
his
bill
of
rights
and
it
was
adopted
the
same
day
with
very
little
discussion
or
as
much
discussion
as
can
be
had
within
the
day.
it's
interesting
that
his
bill,
the
mcclellan
bill
itself,
provided
that
every
aspect
of
the
so-called
bill
of
rights
should
also
be
in
the
secretary
of
labor'
hands
and
should
go
there.
now,
i
say
that
because
a
good
part
of
my
opponents
arguments
are
related
to
the
fact
that
it
was
senator
mcclellan's
investigation
and
his
desire
that
members
should
always
be
able
to
go
into
the
court
to
resolve
any
issue
immediately
in
respect
to
union
affairs.
the
fact
is
that
then
senator
kuchel,
two
days
later
decided
that
it
would
create
a
preemption
problem
if
everything
in
the
bill
of
rights
were
to
--
be
left
to
the
secretary
of
labor
as
well
as
all
the
other
rights
which
were
referred
to
and
the
original
kennedy
bill
and
they
separated
them
and
the
101
(a)
(1)
rights
were
set
aside
for
the
action
of
the
district
court.
what
is
also
significant
is
that
during
the
entire
flow
of
this
legislation,
in
its
discussion
at
the
halls
of
congress,
there
was
never
a
single
suggestion
by
friend
or
foe
of
the
bill
of
the
legislation,
in
concept
or
in
detail
that
eligibility
requirements
which
is
essentially
the
problem
in
this
case
should
be
the
subject
of
direct
court
action.
i
am
very
grateful
for
the
fact
that
my
friend,
only
yesterday,
brought
to
my
attention
and
i
understand
he
has
brought
it
to
the
court's
attention.
a
new
decision
of
the
second
circuit,
the
same
circuit
here
involved
in
respect
to
the
very
issue
we're
discussing
today.
as
i
understand
it,
this
case
came
down
last
tuesday
and
my
friend
was
the
attorney
in
that
case.
at
least
i'm
grateful
that
i
had
it
yesterday,
so
i
could
read
it
overnight.
now,
the
question
is
completely
clarified
as
i
said,
i'm
terribly
grateful
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
clarifying
it.
it
is
no
longer
a
question
of
the
particular
nomination
procedure.
now,
the
second
circuit
has
really
stated
what
the
problem
is
and
that's
the
problem
as
i
suggests
--
as
i
have
suggested
is
before
this
court
in
its
most
vital
sense.
the
second
circuit
--
mr.
david
scribner
i
understand
so.
i
was
told
this
morning
that
you
were
the
--
the
case
is
labutti
against
britsey
(ph).
mr.
david
scribner
it's
in
this
form.
i
refer
to
page
13
at
least
that's
the
page
number
here.
now,
the
second
circuit
is
not
really
at
all
concern
directly
about
the
problem
of
what
happened
at
the
nomination.
the
second
circuit
now
says
as
its
basic
consideration
of
the
problem
are
the
following.
the
right
to
nominate
can
be
infringed
by
restrictions
on
eligibility
for
office
as
well
as
by
rules
dealing
directly
with
the
right
to
nominate.
and
further
goes
on
to
say
in
the
footnote,
footnote
3
on
that
page,
appellants
argue
that
a
limitation
on
illegibility
for
office
can
be
challenged
only
under
section
401
(e).
section
401
to
403
are
concerned
generally
with
union
elections
and
section
401
(e)
in
particular
deals
with
qualifications
for
office
as
well
as
for
nominating
and
voting
and
with
post-election
as
well
as
pre-election
proceedings
--
procedures.
now,
what
we
have
here
is
the
--
what
i
consider
to
be
the
can
out
of
the
bag.
it's
not
the
nominating,
the
process
of
nominating.
it's
the
qualifications
and
the
issues
squarely
before
this
court
is
whether
--
in
determining
whether
the
right
to
nominate,
the
equal
right
to
nominate
has
been
violated
thereby
giving
the
district
court
direct
jurisdiction,
can
the
court
make
a
determination
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
eligibility
requirements
thereby
completely
usurping
the
need
for
a
uniform
labor
policy,
the
need
for
the
expertise
of
the
secretary
of
labor
and
the
design
of
the
--
in
destroying
the
entire
design
that
congress
created
in
a
very
difficult
situation.
mr.
david
scribner
oh,
it's
completely
consistent.
all
i'm
saying
now
is
that
it
clarifies.
mr.
david
scribner
it
clarifies
the
problem.
i'm
delighted
that
it
was
done
because
i
think
the
issue
before
this
court
is
now
all
the
clearing.
mr.
david
scribner
well,
i
was
a
little
troubled
about
it
and
i'll
be
perfectly
frank
to
say
because
of
the
--
what
consider
to
be
a
confusion
between
a
so-called
nominating
procedure
and
qualifications.
because
the
court
in
the
--
in
our
decisions
said,
if
--
it
is
not
ready
to
say
that
either,
that
is
the
self-nomination
procedure
or
the
qualification
standing
alone
would
constitute
a
violation,
and
there
i
was
lost
at
that
moment.
but
the
court
there
said
the
combination
of
the
two.
now,
the
court
goes
one
step
beyond
that
in
concept.
the
court
now
says,
forgetting
about
an
actual
nominating
procedure,
at
least
in
this
sentence,
forgetting
about
the
actual
nature
of
the
nomination
procedure.
the
court
can
consider
the
reasonableness
of
eligibility
requirements
and
determine
that
if
it's
unreasonable,
it
thereby
affects
the
equal
right
to
nominate.
and
that
i
think
is
the
clear
issue
before
this
court.
mr.
david
scribner
yes,
that's
exactly
what
judge
friendly
said.
mr.
david
scribner
that's
right,
the
--
as
i
noted
before,
if
the
nature
of
the
nominations
wouldn't
make
any
difference
in
the
last
analysis
because
if
the
eligibility
requirements
was
severe,
it
doesn't
matter
if
i
can
nominate
ten
other
people.
if
the
eligibility
requirements
affect
them,
then
following
judge
friendly's
opinion
--
judge
friendly's
approach
as
is
clarified
i
think
in
judge
lumbard's
approach,
then
i
would
have
the
right
as
a
nominator
to
say
that
i
have
been
denied
my
right
to
nominate
these
other
people,
forget
about
myself
now,
these
other
people
because
the
eligibility
requirements
are
so
severe
as
to
disqualify
them
and
thereby
denying
this
right,
the
equal
rights
to
nominate.
i
think,
however
you
look
at
it
in
the
last
analysis
as
the
eligibility
requirements
and
shall
it
go
the
secretary
of
labor,
must
it
go
the
secretary
of
labor,
or
can
an
individual
member
at
any
time
proceed
to
the
district
court
say
my
right
to
nominate
has
been
deprived
because
of
the
severity
of
the
nomination
procedure
--
of
the
eligibility
requirement.
i
might
just
attest
a
few
of
the
items
here
if
i
might
for
a
moment.
take
for
instance
the
question
of
the
five-year
membership
requirements.
that's
one
of
the
eligibility
requirements.
now,
if
the
secretary
of
labor
were
considering
this
matter,
what
would
he
take
into
account?
and
we
know
these
other
things
that
he
has
taken
into
account
from
the
official
rules
and
decisions
of
the
secretary
of
labor's
office.
well,
they
would
say,
if
this
union
that
has
a
large
influx
of
new
members,
is
it
a
union
where
there
are
more
men
than
jobs?
is
it
a
union
where
you
have
accretion
constantly?
people
going
out,
new
people
coming
into
the
union,
then
the
quality
of
the
five
years
could
be
determined.
is
it
reasonable?
it
is
unreasonable?
one
year
might
be
unreasonable
under
certain
circumstances.
ten
years
might
be
perfectly
reasonable
under
other
circumstances.
now
in
this
situation,
there
are
more
engineer
--
more
jobs
than
engineers
can
fill.
and
the
secretary
of
labor
would
consider
whether
or
not
there
are
enough
licensed
marine
engineers
now
in
the
industry
which
would
indicate
there's
need
for
more.
or
whether
or
not,
there
is
a
shortage
of
engineers
which
means
no
new
members
are
coming
in
and
that
those
who
are
in
have
been
in
for
a
long
time.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
one
of
the
problems
of
the
maritime
industry.
take
the
other
question.
take
the
question
of
the
seatime
employment
which
is
another
consideration,
a
180
days
is
required
of
seatime
employment
in
each
of
the
two
or
three
years
preceding
the
nomination.
well,
that's
a
number,
that's
a
number.
it
means
--
on
its
face,
it's
completely
meaningless
unless
there
was
some
intensive
research
and
analysis
of
what
that
means
in
the
particular
industry.
this
is
the
maritime
industry.
what
are
its
consequences?
another
thing,
how
many
persons,
and
is
this
a
factual
matter
that
can
be
determined
almost
immediately,
does
this
affect?
does
this
mean
that
95%
will
be
disqualified?
does
this
mean
that
5%
will
be
disqualified?
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
this
record
which
was
the
basis
for
any
determination
by
the
district
court,
the
same
is
true
by
the
circuit
court,
the
same
is
true
on
the
five-year
element.
the
reason
there
was
no
record
to
go
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
is
that
it
was
dismissed
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
down
below.
so,
we're
caught
in
a
situation
where
the
district
court,
where
the
federal
court,
the
court
of
appeals
has
made
a
determination
that
it's
unreasonable.
oh,
that's
exactly
the
sort
of
thing
that
it
could
not
have
done
and
should
not
have
done,
that
only
the
secretary
of
labor
under
the
scheme
of
the
act
should
have
done
it.
another
thing,
take
the
situation
wherefore
the
office
of
district
president
which
by
the
way
none
of
these
respondents
have
sought.
they
--
none
of
them
sought
office.
they
have
nominated
themselves
for
office.
none
of
them
have
sought
to
nominate
anybody
else
for
that's
(inaudible).
now
another
determination
might
come,
is
it
evil
on
its
face?
can
it
be
said
that
it
is
evil
on
its
face
that
merely
by
stating
it?
it
is
an
unreasonable
qualification?
it
might
well
be.
on
the
other
hand,
it
might
not
be.
suppose
i
said,
before
you
had
a
thousand
locals
within
the
particular
organization
or
subbody
and
you
had
a
thousand
officers
or
more
who
had
served
one
day,
it
doesn't
matter
as
does
the
--
as
the
constitutional
provision
doesn't
say
how
much
you
can
serve,
you
can
serve
one
day,
as
a
faithful
time
appointed
office.
well,
you
might
have
a
thousand
people.
it
might
not
be
unreasonable.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
had
50,
10,
5,
2,
it
might
be
unreasonable.
but
there's
nothing
in
the
consideration
of
the
circuit
court
which
will
go
to
that
issue.
all
the
circuit
court
did
was
to
put
together
the
two
items
and
say,
this
is
the
denial
of
the
equal
right
to
nominate
although,
either
by
itself
would
not
necessarily
violate
either
of
the
statute.
i
say
that's
the
evil
in
this
situation.
i
say
that's
the
evil
that
congress
saw
and
tried
to
avoid,
to
keep
a
uniform
labor
policy
and
to
maintain
a
minimum
interference
with
the
affairs
of
the
union.
mr.

if
i
may
--
mr.
david
scribner
first,
i'd
like
to
clarify
the
situation
as
it
affects
the
question
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
on
the
status
of
the
election
itself.
actually
the
ballots
have
been
impounded.
they
are
now
in
the
possession
of
the
clerk
of
the
district
court
awaiting
determination
of
this
court.
in
the
event,
it
is
found
that
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction
then
obviously
those
ballots
would
be
counted.
if
it
was
held
otherwise,
then
we
go
on
to
another
stage
of
the
proceeding.
and
that
was
arranged
for
by
the
way
when
i
made
an
application
to
mr.
justice
harlan
for
a
stay,
and
my
adversary
and
i,
before
mr.
justice
harlan
were
able
to
come
to
that
understanding
so
that
we
preserved
the
res
and
otherwise
we
--
that
had
not
been
done,
we
would
not
have
a
subject
matter
to
preserve
if
there
were
reversal
by
this
court.
mr.
david
scribner
oh,
yes
indeed.
now
with
the
reference
to
professor
clyde
summers
interests
me.
the
position
of
the
respondents
actually
and
of
the
amici
who
is
supporting
respondents
is
really
not
in
full
reliance
on
the
second
circuit's
decisions
or
reasoning.
in
fact,
it
appears
that
they
distrust
the
full
validity
of
the
decisions.
they
rely
now
on
something
else
and
that
is
what
professor
summers
has
suggested
and
which
has
been
rejected
in
every
court,
district
court
that
has
heard
it.
and
that
is
that
section
401
(e)
not
only
allows
for
post-election
remedies
but
also
allows
for
pre-election
remedies.
it's
a
sort
of
thing
where
it's
tidy.
section
401,
if
you
have
a
problem
under
section
401,
the
member
wants
to
go
into
the
district
court,
well,
he
may.
on
the
other
hand
if
after
an
election,
then
you
go
to
the
secretary
of
labor
and
it
creates
a
sort
of
tidiness
which
is
wholly
out
of
keeping
with
what
the
congress
said
because
there
is
no
question
that
insofar
as
401
(e)
rights
are
concerned,
they
must
go
the
secretary
of
labor
and
they
can
only
go
after
an
election.
as
a
matter
--
the
proof
of
that
is
in
an
exception.
that
exception
was
provided
on
the
very
day
that
the
bill
of
rights
was
adopted.
no,
that
the
culture
amendment
was
adopted.
what
happened
there
was
as
they
were
considering
the
amendment,
that
is
the
bill
of
rights
as
amended
by
senator
kuchel
on
april
25th,
1959,
senator
javits
presented
a
different
problem.
he
said,
"let's
make
sure
that
we
give
the
right
of
a
member,
of
a
candidate
rather,
to
have
equal
treatment
in
respect
to
the
distribution
of
campaign
material".
and
they
adopted
on
that
day
an
amendment
to
title
iv
which
provided
that
in
that
particular
instant
and
by
the
way
in
no
other
instance
in
the
title
iv
may
a
candidate
go
directly
to
the
district
court
without
going
to
the
secretary
of
labor.
in
other
words,
we
have
proof
--
simple
proof
of
the
rule
by
the
one
exception
that
was
permitted.
now,
the
attitude
taken
by
professor
clyde
summers
has
been
as
i
said
considered
by
the
other
courts,
and
i
said
it's
an
interesting
suggestion
that
might
be
quite
tidy
but
it
happens
not
to
be
what
the
legislature
has
provided,
and
--
oh,
yes,
we
referred
to
that
affirmance
that
referred
to
--
in
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
a
matter
of
fact.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
here
refers
to
it
and
says,
“gives
the
attitude
to
the
court's
honor.”
and
says
that
issue
was
not
the
way
it
was
--
it
was
not
the
way
it
was
considered
certainly
by
the
court
of
appeals.
they
did
not
adopt
it.
now
--
and
just
one
other
item
and
i
close
with
that,
it's
hardly
my
function
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
secretary
of
labor
at
this
point
based
on
what
has
been
said
about
him
a
little
while
ago.
