mr.
burton
h.
hall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i'd
like
to
formally
to
request
permission
to
submit
copies
of
the
labutti
(ph)
decision.
let
me
clear
up
one
fact,
that
decision
is
dated
last
tuesday.
it
--
i
was
notified
it
--
of
it
late
thursday
afternoon
on
the
date
it
was
printed.
mr.
burton
h.
hall
i
obtained
it
friday
and
i
sir,
gave
a
copy
of
it
to
my
friend
as
quickly
as
i
could
which
is
yesterday
morning
at
11
o'clock.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
bring
suit
to
protect
the
right
to
nominate
candidates,
not
their
right
to
be
candidates.
the
record
which
that
--
the
complaint
which
is
at
pages
2
to
10
of
the
record,
sets
forth
the
provisions
of
the
union
constitution
bylaws.
most
of
which
were
suddenly
imposed
upon
the
members
on
the
very
eve
of
this
--
of
this
election.
i
was
about
to
say
this
last
election,
actually
it's
the
first
election.
since
this
low
--
this
union,
this
district,
has
never
held
a
general
election
for
officers
before,
all
except
two
of
the
officers,
two
branch
agents
having
been
appointed
to
their
office.
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
members'
rights
to
nominate
candidates
and
to
vote
for
the
candidates
of
their
choice
are
being
infringed
by
a
set
of
provisions
which
with
one
hand
prohibit
them
from
nominating
anybody
other
than
themselves.
and
with
the
other
hand,
prohibit
them
from
nominating
themselves.
the
prohibition
on
nominating
anybody
other
than
themselves
is
in
the
bylaws.
the
prohibitions
of
nominating
themselves
are
in
these
new
eligibility
requirements
which
are
not
entirely
as
my
friend
stated.
for
instance
the
eligibility
rule
for
pre
--
for
the
district
presidency
and
for
the
president
--
the
all
national
officers,
the
national
is
not
a
party
here
but
it
is
of
course
related,
is
that
the
man
--
the
person
to
be
nominated,
that
is
the
nominator
under
the
bylaw,
must
have
served
as
a
paid
full-time
officer.
thus,
for
instance,
the
elected
treasurer,
the
former
new
york
local,
the
largest
local
in
the
union
until
it
was
dissolved
in
1961
was
declared
ineligible
as
i
noted
in
the
footnote.
i
think
footnote
22
of
my
brief
because
his
office
was
not
a
paid
one.
i
might
add
although
it's
not
in
my
brief
that
he
had
actually
served
as
a
paid
member
of
the
election's
board
for
a
few
days,
but
that
was
not
held
suitable
to
make
him
eligible.
the
result
of
course
of
such
a
rule
is
to
make
it
impossible
for
the
--
for
any
member
even
if
the
bylaw
weren't
existing
to
nominate
any
but
a
handful
of
candidate
--
choose
from
any
but
a
handful
of
candidates,
virtually
all
of
them
can
be
expected
to
be
on
the
administration
team.
it's
not
impossible
in
other
words
to
put
up
a
opposition
slate.
as
per
all
other
offices
in
the
union,
the
candidate
to
be
nominated
or
to
nominate
himself
must
have
served
180
days
of
seatime
for
each
of
two
years
in
the
three
years
immediately
preceding
the
election.
this
requirement
in
other
words,
they
just
served
to
have
half
of
each
of
two
years,
in
the
recent
last
two
years,
would
eliminate
a
very
large
portion
of
the
membership.
it's
disputed
in
the
record.
the
plaintiff's
affidavit
asserts
that
that
it
would
eliminate
approximately
half
the
members
from
availability
or
from
the
power
to
nominate
themselves.
well,
the
defendant's
affidavit
asserts
that
it
would
eliminate
only
about
25%
of
itself
but
it
would
nevertheless
eliminate
a
substantial
number
just
by
that.
at
any
rate,
these
plaintiffs
are
--
and
along
with
a
great
many
of
their
fellow
members
are
unable
to
nominate
any
candidate
whatsoever
for
any
office
whatsoever
and
it's
primarily
of
that
prohibition
of
which
that
they
complain.
now,
the
issue
here
is
not
whether
that's
reasonable
or
not.
the
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
it
is
unreasonable.
moreover,
it
would
--
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
would
have
been
as
such
restrictions
on
the
right
to
nominate,
it
would
have
been
invalid
at
common
law,
long
before
the
labor-management
reporting
and
disclosure
act
is
passed.
however,
the
union
has
not
petition
for
certiorari
on
that
issue.
the
union
has
come
to
this
court
only
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
claiming
that
even
though
these
provisions
do
infringe
the
members'
right
to
nominate
candidates,
still
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
over
a
complaint
aimed
at
attack
--
attacking
these
restrictive
provisions.
i
might
add
that
after
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case,
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
district
court.
the
district
court
then
considered
other
defenses
raised
by
the
defendants,
namely
latches
and
the
claimed
failure
of
the
plaintiffs'
to
exhaust
all
their
internal
union
remedies,
found
these
to
be
no
barred
to
the
complaint
and
issued
a
preliminary
injunction.
there
was
no
appeal
taken
from
that
decision
so
of
course
those
matters
are
not
before
this
court
either.
the
issues
before
them
boils
down
as
to
whether
provisions
of
the
union
constitution
which
deprived
members
of
any
of
the
rights
set
forth
in
section
101
(a)
(1),
equal
on
democratic
rights
to
vote,
to
nominate
candidates,
to
consult.
mr.
burton
h.
hall
yes.
mr.
burton
h.
hall
the
--
by
the
time
the
court
of
appeals
acted,
an
election
had
begun.
it
had
not
begun
at
the
time
the
suit
was
brought.
it
began
about
three
weeks
later
with
the
mailing
of
ballots
out
to
members
and
over
a
three-month
period,
they
came
back
again.
by
the
time
the
district
court
acted
these
ballots
went
--
they
had
come
back
or
were
coming
back.
the
district
court
thereupon
enjoined
the
counting
of
these
ballots,
declared
this
election
not
to
be
carried
out.
the
plaintiff's
then
brought
a
motion
to
require
the
holding
of
an
election
so
--
on
the
obvious
ground
that
if
there's
no
election
and
the
rights
to
vote
and
to
nominate
candidates
were
completely
denied.
that
motion
is
still
pending.
several
questions,
several
points
--
i
don't
want
to
quote
a
remarks
made
in
chambers
but
sir,
it's
my
understanding
that
the
reason
why
that
motion
is
being
held
up
is
the
very
fact
of
the
considerations
by
this
court
of
an
entire
question
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
burton
h.
hall
i
don't
know
that
any
future
election
will
be
held
under
the
revised
constitution
but
at
a
convention
held
this
year,
there
are
annual
conventions,
the
constitution
was
revised
and
certainly
certain
changes
were
made
which
do
changed
the
nomination's
requirement,
make
them
more
liberal.
i
want
to
say
i
don't
know
the
future
election
will
be
held
is
apparent
from
the
union's
resistance
to
holding
a
new
election
in
the
district
right
now
that
they
do
not
want
to
or
the
officials
do
not
want
to
hold
an
election
under
these
new
provisions.
as
to
the
national
election,
that
won't
be
held
until
1968
and
i
doubt
very
much
whether
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
the
officials
to
reamend
the
constitution
in
the
meantime,
to
put
it
truly
that
it
should
be
off.
may
i
point
out
that
--
i'm
jumping
ahead
now
in
the
a
late
footnote
in
my
brief,
i
think
footnote
22,
i
refer
to
an
instance
which
i
think
explains
one
of
the
inadequacies
of
the
title
iv
remedy.
the
treasurer
had
said
of
local
33
in
new
york,
the
biggest
local
in
the
union,
a
former
treasurer,
had
nominated
himself
for
a
national
office.
several
other
members
have
also
nominated
themselves
for
national
offices.
they
are
required
under
the
national
constitution
also
to
nominate
themselves
only.
the
--
so
they
--
they
have
one,
the
election
--
after
the
election
was
held
in
the
summer
of
1963,
they
also
petitioned
--
protested
to
the
secretary
of
labor.
the
secretary
for
reasons
which
are
not
explained
decided
to
bring
a
suit
with
regards
to
the
pacific
coast
district
but
not
with
the
regard
to
the
national.
now,
i
don't
know
how
proper
it
is
for
me
go
into
this
which
is
not
in
the
record.
but
i
have
here
a
copy
of
a
letter
which
is
sent
to
mr.
(inaudible),
the
treasurer.
the
letter
is
a
covering
letter.
it
covers
a
letter
--
copy
of
a
letter
which
had
been
sent
to
me
in
an
attempt
to
explain
--
the
effort
to
explain
what
had
happen.
the
letter
goes
on
for
about
two
pages
reciting
changes
in
the
new
constitution
and
then
in
a
final
paragraph
it
says,
taking
into
consideration
all
the
necessary
factors
without
specifying
anything
in
particular
just
listing
a
mess
of
them.
it
says
that
it
was
our
opinion
that
the
pacific
coast
district
case
presents
a
more
promising
prospect
for
successful
litigation.
i
suggest
this
that,
as
a
very
uncertain
that
this
indicates
as
i
think
the
other
--
the
whole
nature
of
the
title
iv
remedy
indicate
that
this
is
a
--
entirely
uncertain
and
inadequate
protection
to
democ
--
for
democratic
rights
of
union
members.
i'll
repeat
that
point
a
little
later
if
i
get
to
it.
mr.
burton
h.
hall
oh,
no.
the
--
no
--
oh,
i'm
sorry
to
get
off
the
subject.
no.
the
issue
here
is
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
over
the
complaint.
now,
the
complaint
of
course
is
not
concerned
with
any
one
election.
it's
concerned
with
the
rights
to
nominate
candidates
and
to
vote,
obviously
that
refers
to
all
elections
in
the
future.
mr.
burton
h.
hall
three
years.
that's
the
maximum
term
under
the
new
act.
i
(inaudible)
--
or
to
fill
out
something
else
i've
said,
the
district
was
created
in
1961.
all
districts
were
created
in
1961
and
local
unions
abolished.
two
officers,
president
and
secretary-treasurer
were
simply
appointed
to
be
(inaudible)
officers
of
this
district.
also,
various
business
agents
of
the
local
were
appointed
as
branch
agents
of
the
--
for
the
various
--
for
the
districts.
all
officers
except
two
then
hold
their
offices
at
the
moment
by
appointment.
these
two
have
to
do
with
vacancies
that
occurred
when
special
elections
were
held.
in
jacksonville
and
i
think
in
galveston.
mr.
burton
h.
hall
yes.
mr.
burton
h.
hall
to
some
degree
but
it
doesn't
infringe
the
section
101
(a)
(1)
right.
the
101
(a)
(1)
guarantees
that
every
member
of
the
labor
organization,
the
rights
to
nominate
and
so
on,
equal
rights
and
privileges
to
nominate,
subject
to
reasonable
rules
and
regulations
in
the
union's
constitution
and
bylaws.
so
obviously,
a
reasonable
eligibility
requirement
would
not
limit
the
right
as
guarantee.
it
will
only
limit
the
fact
of
--
the
freedom
to
nominate.
an
unreasonable
rule
or
law
would
infringe
the
right
as
guaranteed
by
that
section.
now,
the
holding
of
the
circuit
court
which
i
think
is
unchallengeable
and
has
not
been
challenged
on
this
appeal
as
if
these
--
these
set
of
provisions
does
--
is
in
fact
an
unreasonable
restriction
--
mr.
burton
h.
hall
there's
no
need
for
evidence
because
what
the
complaint
alleges
are
simply
the
existence
of
these
two
--
these
various
provisions
in
the
constitution
and
bylaws.
now,
there's
been
no
denial
that
they
actually
exist
so
that
all
of
the
material
is
before
the
court.
is
never
--
never
any
request
for
a
hearing
to
explain
the
nature
of
the
provisions
or
anything
like
that.
all
of
the
relevant
evidence
is
in
the
papers.
the
problem
of
the
rights
of
union
members
and
especially
in
electoral
rights
of
the
union
members
has
been
a
matter
of
considerable
concern
for
a
good
many
years
to
virtually
anyone
of
--
who
had
--
who
sides
with
and
is
friendly
to
the
labor
movement.
organizations
like
the
civil
liberties
union
and
the
workers
defense
league
both
of
which
are
amici
here
beside,
the
association
of
cabinet
trade
unions
have
been
active
in
this
area
pressing
either
for
a
voluntary
bill
of
rights
for
union
members
and
for
voluntary
review
such
as
now
exists
in
the
united
automobile
workers,
and
also
for
federal
legislation
to
protect
the
democratic
rights
of
union
members.
this
is
a
problem
which
has
grown
up
primarily
as
a
result
of
the
growth
of
an
establishment
inside
some
of
the
unions,
a
bureaucratic
establishment,
very
much
like
the
establishment
exists
in
government
and
in
large
business
corporations.
and
the
problem
of
protecting
union
members
has
--
have
been
seen
generally
as
a
right
of
protecting
them
against
the
power
of
these
establishment
to
oppress
them
within
their
union.
the
--
a
very
similar
question
or
issue
involved
--
a
similar
issue
came
before
this
court
in
the
famous
case
of
steele
against
louisville
&
nashville
where
this
court
inquired
into
the
powers
of
a
union
over
an
individual
working
man,
subject
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
subject
to
the
powers
that
the
collective
bargaining
agent
had
under
--
on
its
--
under
the
railway
labor
act.
this
court
pointed
out
that
the
act
had
conferred
upon
the
collective
bargaining
representatives,
a
power
similar
to
a
legislative
body
to
restrict
or
expand
the
rights
of
individuals.
and
it
pointed
out
that
this
implied
a
corresponding
duty
to
protect
the
rights
of
individual
members.
in
fact
justice
murphy
went
even
further
and
said
that
there
would
be
a
serious
constitutional
question,
if
it
were
not
to
the
fact
--
if
there
were
no
power
of
the
courts
to
protect
the
rights
of
individual
members
against
the
powers
of
the
union
leadership
or
the
establishment
to
injure
the
individual.
the
same
thing
of
course
applies
to
intra-union
rights
and
it's
this
area
that
which
the
labor-management
reporting
and
disclosure
act
attempted
to
go
in
order
to
protect
the
rights
of
members.
the
history
of
the
act
makes
clear
i
think
what
the
purpose
of
the
bill
of
rights
was
and
the
provision
under
which
we're
dealing
here.
the
act
as
you
know
begins
with
a
--
as
your
honors,
begins
with
the
recognition
that
the
state
decisions
had
provided
a
substantial
measure
of
pre-election
protection
of
union
members'
democratic
rights
but
had
provided
only
inadequate
protection
after
the
election
for
abuses
which
occurred
during
the
election.
so,
when
the
act
is
originally
drafted
and
the
committee
originally
dealt
with
in
march
--
february
of
1959,
it
provided
a
new
post-election
remedy
that
is,
that
it
conferred
upon
the
secretary
of
labor,
the
power
in
certain
instances
to
set
aside
the
results
of
an
election
and
order
a
new
one
where
a
violation
had
occurred
and
where
the
violation
was
so
serious
as
to
affect
--
as
probably
to
affect
the
outcome
of
the
election.
but
the
--
but
even
the
drafts
of
the
original
bill
were
very
careful
to
preserve
all
existing
pre-election
remedies.
now,
these
pre-election
remedies,
being
state
remedies
had
been
brought
--
had
been
based
on
the
theory
of
contract,
that
the
union
constitution
is
a
contract
between
the
members
of
the
union.
as
a
practical
matter,
many
of
the
cases
went
beyond
anything
said
in
the
union
constitution.
i
have
cited
several
cases,
several
new
york
cases
in
my
brief
and
two
of
them
are
(inaudible).
there
was
nothing
whatever
in
the
contract
to
the
--
of
the
constitution
that
was
a
much
help
to
the
plaintiffs.
but
the
courts
there
as
the
courts
have
elsewhere,
read
the
union
constitution
in
the
light
of
the
democratic
purposes
of
unionism
itself
and
in
the
light
as
justice
hammer
said,
if
the
--
of
the
--
free
traditions
of
a
free
people
proud
of
their
democratic
heritage.
and
in
that
light,
it
gave
protection
to
the
members'
rights
to
have
an
election
and
have
the
election
fairly
conducted,
inducing
the
court
set
forth
an
elaborate
series
of
protections
which
should
be
carried
out
including
the
use
of
--
not
including
the
use
of
voting
machines
but
the
appellate
division
--
modified
to
inquire
--
require
the
use
of
voting
machines.
the
--
at
any
rate
the
bill
as
it
reached
the
senate
reported
out
by
the
committee
provided
a
post-election
remedy
and
was
--
and
protected
all
existing
state
pre-election
remedies,
but
the
senate
found
this
inadequate.
essentially,
the
senate
took
the
position
that
there
should
be
a
federal
pre-election
remedy
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
the
senate
undertook
to
add
a
bill
of
rights
to
the
bill
as
it
--
as
the
bill
reached
it.
now,
the
senate
passed
one
bill
of
rights,
was
unsatisfied
with
it
and
passed
another
bill
of
rights,
the
kuchel
substitute
and
this
--
even
the
substitute
went
--
underwent
some
modification
later
on.
but
the
clear
purpose
of
the
bill
of
rights
was
to
protect
--
was
to
provide
direct
relief.
under
the
kuchel
amendment,
it
became
enforceable
at
the
suit
of
the
member
himself
where
union
members'
democratic
rights
including
the
rights
to
nominate
candidates
and
to
vote.
now,
i've
said
that
i
would
get
in
a
moment
and
i'll
try
to
take
--
make
just
a
moment
into
comparing
the
pre
right
--
the
pre-election
rights
to
nominate
candidates
with
the
post-election
title
iv
rights.
i've
said
that
the
title
iv
remedy
is
inadequate
and
i'd
like
to
list
the
reasons
why.
first
of
all,
because
it
is
a
post-election
remedy
and
here
i
refer
to
the
quotations
in
my
brief
and
in
the
workers
defense
league's
brief
from
a
study
reported
by
professor
clyde
summers
in
the
a
law
journal.
the
reason
why
i
regard
that
article
as
important
as
it
is,
is
that
it
is
the
result
of
a
study
commissioned
by
the
new
york
legislature,
the
labor
and
management
improper
practices
act.
of
all
new
york
cases
reported
and
unreported,
most
of
them
unrep
--
of
course
unreported,
dealing
with
internal
union
affairs
and
internal
union
elections,
the
report
there
covered
several
hundred
cases.
it
involved
--
is
to
be
subject
so
they're
in
the
records
that
involved
discussions
with
the
lawyers
who
are
active
in
most
of
it.
the
conclusions
which
professor
summers
reached
and
which
the
committee
--
which
the
official
reporter
reached
where
that
pre-election
remedies
were
the
only
ones
of
any
practical
value,
post-election
remedies
were
utterly
unsatisfactory
because
they
provided
no
--
too
little
protection
to
the
members
since
they
came
so
late
and
too
much
burden
to
the
union.
post-election
remedy
after
all
involved
the
setting
aside
of
an
election,
the
throwing
of
the
question
of
the
entire
structure
of
the
union
as
to
who
is
going
to
be
--
who
is
entitled
to
be
the
leader
of
it.
it
involved
exacerbating
any
factional
struggle
which
may
exist.
and
it
involves
the
expense
and
nuisance
of
an
election
that
recalled
for
by
the
ballot.
that
is
one
reason
for
instance
why
in
all
of
the
new
york
cases
that
professor
summers
came
across,
he
find
only
one
in
which
such
a
post-election
remedy
was
granted.
and
that
was
a
case
where
the
officials
where
accused
of
very
serious
financial
misdealing
and
a
new
election
was
necessary
to
protect
the
treasury
from
being
dissipated
entirely.
in
all
other
cases,
the
court
--
in
all
the
other
post-election
cases,
the
court
has
found
some
reason
or
rather
--
were
not
moving.
instantly
on
that
point
and
in
making
that
point,
i'd
like
withdraw
any
inference
that
i
have
--
that
may
have
been
improper
activity
in
--
the
secretary
is
not
moving
against
the
national
union
while
it
did
move
against
the
pacific
coast
district
election,
this
is
a
problem
which
confronts
anybody
who
attempts
to
upset
an
election
already
taken
place
because
of
its
seriousness.
in
fact,
i've
cited
one
case
where
the
court
went
in
to
this
very
question.
this
is
ford
against
kearns
where
the
claim
was
that
the
union
president
had
used
the
union
newspaper
to
campaign
for
reelection.
the
court
very
clearly
said
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
complaining
member
to
bring
suit
before
the
election
that
since
the
complaining
member
waited
until
the
election
occurred
and
then
brought
suit
to
the
very
extreme
relief
of
offsetting
the
election,
therefore
no
relief
were
--
that
the
election
would
not
be
upset.
that
of
course
is
the
prime
reason
and
the
most
important
reason
why
a
title
iv
remedy
is
inadequate
standing
by
itself.
the
title
iv
remedy
is
better
than
the
remedy
that
it
took
--
was
place
it
took,
namely
the
state
post-election
remedy.
but
it's
not
adequate
to
fill
the
bill
as
far
as
whole
remedies
are
concerned.
another
remedy
is
again
the
power
of
the
bureaucratic
establishments
which
has
gone
up
as
i
say
inside
many
unions
to
make
its
influence
felt
within
the
sec
--
the
department
of
labor,
so
that
as
in
the
rank
and
file
union
members
seize
it,
when
he
appeals
to
the
secretary
of
labor
to
set
aside
the
results
of
the
election,
he's
appealing
in
a
sense,
in
a
large
sense,
to
his
enemies'
ally
to
protect
him
against
his
enemy.
i
--
mr.
burton
h.
hall
i
don't
know
your
honor.
i
know
that's
how
a
great
many
members
see
it.
the
--
pardon
me,
i
think
i'd
mention
one
reason
by
--
i
believe
a
title
iv
remedy
is
inadequate
as
a
single
remedy
protection.
the
remedy
itself
takes
approximately
two
years
or
maybe
longer
to
effectuate.
under
the
act,
the
members
require
an
exhaust
remedies
for
three
months
at
least.
after
the
election
was
taken
place,
he
then
goes
to
the
secretary
of
labor
and
that
process
takes
60
days.
the
secretary
of
labor
if
he
then
--
if
he
decides
to
move,
then
files
a
suit
which
will
take
anywhere
from
one
or
two
or
--
years
or
longer
to
end
its
way
to
trial.
now
in
the
course
of
that
time,
it's
entirely
likely
that
the
term
of
office
would
have
expired
and
new
election
would
have
been
held,
it
will
be
about
to
be
held,
and
the
case
in
all
important
respects
will
have
--
become
new
moot.
we'll
be
dealing
with
new
violations
by
the
time
the
case
comes
down,
not
within
the
old
ones,
will
be
no
longer
of
any
importance.
there
are
some
instances
in
which
the
secretary
of
labor
is
able,
despite
this
time
limitation,
to
provide
some
kind
of
a
remedy.
but
there
are
many
other
instances
whereas
remedy
would
be
ineffectual
entirely,
simply
because
of
the
impossibility
of
getting
to
trial
until
the
current
terms
of
office
had
expired.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
congress
did
not
view
the
title
iv
remedy
as
a
sole
reliance
at
any
rate.
even
the
drafters
of
the
bill
saw
a
dual
protection
for
democratic
rights
in
the
union
elections.
the
pre-election
remedy
which
they
regarded
first
as
a
state
remedy,
and
secondly,
the
post-election
title
iv
remedy.
when
they
came
to
the
matter,
they
saw
merely
that
one
--
that
one
of
these
two
remedies
was
inadequate
as
it
existed.
so
they
replaced
the
state
post-election
remedy
with
a
federal
post-election
remedy.
when
the
matter
got
to
the
court
and
to
the
senate,
the
senate
decided
to
build
up
the
other
avenue
of
protection
by
providing
a
federal
pre-election
remedy
to
supplement
and
go
along
with
the
state
pre-election
remedy.
to
knock
down
half
of
what
congress
built,
namely
the
pre-election
remedies,
would
be
to
emasculate
the
act
and
to
leave
only
the
weakest
of
the
protection
standard
which
congress
sought
to
create.
that's
why
primarily,
i
want
to
contend
that
if
it
were
held
as
this
--
as
the
petitioner
is
asking
this
court
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
advancing
an
election,
no
jurisdiction
under
title
i
to
protect
democratic
rights
to
the
members,
then
these
extremely
valuable
rights,
the
right
to
vote
for
candidate
of
one's
choice,
which
this
court
only
last
june
in
reynolds
against
sims
held
that
the
essence
of
the
democratic
society,
then
these
democratic
rights
would
have
no
real
protection.
it
will
only
have
a
very
uncertain
long
delayed
and
inadequate
possibility
of
protection
under
title
iv
of
the
act.
