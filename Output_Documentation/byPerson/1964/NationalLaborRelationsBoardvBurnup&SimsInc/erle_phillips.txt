mr.
erle
phillips
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
there
is
a
real
good
reason,
mr.
justice
brennan
why
the
board
in
this
case
didn't
seek
review
of
anything
except
the
good
faith
fact.
this
--
this
is
somewhat
unusual
case.
the
trial
examiner,
mr.
wheatley
completely
vindicated
the
company
and
recommended
dismissal
of
the
complaint
in
its
entirety.
curiously
enough,
mr.
wheatley
is
also
the
trial
examiner
and
tried
cusano,
industrial
cotton
and
rubin
brothers,
the
three
main
cases
in
this
area
of
a
good
faith
defense.
this
is
the
same
man.
he
tried
the
other
three
cases
and
found
that
the
good
faith
belief
was
not
sufficient.
but
in
this
case,
he
heard
the
whole
case
and
recommended
that
the
complaint
be
dismissed.
i
think
under
this
court's
rule
in
universal
camera,
the
lower
court
certainly
was
entitled
to
consider
not
only
the
board's
finding
which
i
think
was
wrong
in
reversing
the
trial
examiner
but
in
--
and
to
consider
the
trial
examiner's
report,
he
had
the
witnesses
before
him,
he
made
certain
findings.
he
for
instance
did
not
make
a
finding
that
the
threats
never
were
made.
he
didn't
have
to
go
that
far
because
he
found
there
was
no
violation.
it's
an
interesting
question
too
why
pate
was
not
called.
i
didn't
try
the
case,
i
don't
know.
i
know
a
lawyer
in
my
office
tried
it.
we
tried
the
case
on
the
theory
of
rubin
brothers
so
it
didn't
make
any
difference
whether
pate
had
told
or
whether
he
had
been
threatened
about
it.
that's
what
we
were
told.
but
this
cuts
two
weights
as
counsel
for
the
board,
general
--distinguished
general
counsel
has
said,
the
board
didn't
call
him
either.
general
counsel
didn't
call
him.
the
man
was
sitting
there.
no
one
called
him.
now,
an
advantage
to
the
court
and
i
know
of
nothing
to
do
but
apologize,
there's
a
serious
mistake
in
our
brief
on
page
15.
we
quote
cusano
as
being
a
case
involving
the
discharge
of
a
striker.
that's
incorrect.
it
was
not.
i
certainly
must
apologize.
i
will
distinguish
the
case
however.
now
as
i
think
it's
clear
at
this
point,
remember
one
question
properly
i
submit
before
the
court
and
that
is
whether
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
discharge
an
employee
who
is
engaged
in
solicitation
for
union
membership.
we
call
them
mistaken
but
good
faith
belief
that
the
employees
threatened
to
dynamite
the
plant
during
the
course
of
this
union
solicitation.
i
think
the
counsel
for
petitioner
has
made
a
fair
statement
of
the
facts
with
the
additions
i
made.
one,
if
the
trial
examiner
recommended
complete
dismissal
and
found
no
violation
and
this
with
an
experienced
trial
examiner
who
heard
the
other
good
faith
belief
cases.
secondly,
this
--
mr.
erle
phillips
he
didn't
have
to
reach
that
mr.
justice
white.
he
found
there
was
no
violation
whatsoever.
he
said
assuming
arguendo
that
--
that
the
threats
were
not
made.
i
don't
think
he
said.
i
don't
think
rubin
bro
--
brothers
applies.
i
don't
think
i
have
to
reach
rubin
brothers.
i
just
don't
think
it's
a
violation
here
at
all
and
recommended
dismissal
in
time.
secondly,
in
that
same
connection,
this
of
course
is
a
case
in
which
there
is
absolutely
no
other
evidence
of
any
union
motivation
or
any
union
activity.
there
was
no
independent
8
(a)
(1)
activity
alleged
in
the
complaint.
there
were
no
acts
of
surveillance.
no
acts
of
intimidation,
no
threats.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
employer
probably
demonstrated
a
lot
more
restraint
than
some
others
would
have
because
--
mr.
erle
phillips
yes
sir.
mr.
erle
phillips
yes
sir.
mr.
erle
phillips
well
i
think,
initially,
the
board
found
that
the
threats
have
not
been
made
and
that
therefore
the
rubin
brothers,
board
case
were
not
applicable
and
therefore
it
found
a
violation
one
as
to
the
layoff
of
three
man
and
then
two,
as
to
the
subsequent
discharge
while
on
layoff
of
the
two
men.
mr.
erle
phillips
they
held
that
if
there
was
a
good
faith
belief
that
it
would
not
avail
the
employer
because
it
affirmatively
was
proven
by
general
counsel
that
the
good
faith
belief
was
mistaken.
mr.
erle
phillips
yes
sir,
yes
sir,
contrary
to
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
erle
phillips
no
sir.
the
court
of
appeals
as
i
read
the
opinion,
said,
recognizing
the
limitation
on
our
right
to
review
as
set
forth
in
universal
camera,
we
accept
the
board's
findings
with
respect
to
the
discriminatory
layoff.
but
with
respect
to
the
discharge,
we
--
we
disagree
with
the
board
and
we
continue
to
follow
rubin
brothers
and
which
we
say
essentially,
this
is
the
fifth
circuit
that
a
good
faith
belief
is
a
--
is
sufficient.
mr.
erle
phillips
the
court
disagreed
with
this,
the
lower
court.
mr.
erle
phillips
yes.
yes,
they
found
that
there
was
a
good
faith.
mr.
erle
phillips
well,
i
think
the
answer
is
that
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
of
the
lack
of
good
faith
belief.
now,
the
board
has
argued
in
this
belief
and
as
argued
here
that
this
employee
didn't
do
enough.
i
submit
what
more
can
the
employer
do.
there
are
only
three
people
involved,
the
man
who
was
threatened
and
the
two
men
who
threatened.
we
got
an
affidavit
from
the
man
who
was
threatened.
he
reported
first.
we
interviewed
him.
we
got
his
affidavit.
we
can't
do
anymore
with
him.
we
can
give
him
a
lie
detector
test
maybe
but
that
is
not
very
worthwhile,
it
won't
stand
up.
and
now
second,
the
only
other
thing
we
can
do
i
submit
is
to
go
to
the
two
people
that,
who
we
believe,
who
have
threatened
to
dynamite
the
plant.
we
say,
“did
you
threaten
to
dynamite
the
plant?”
the
man
said,
“no.”
i
think
he'd
say
no.
i
don't
believe
he'd
admit
it.
i
submit
further,
have
we
done
that?
have
we
gone
through
these
men
and
interrogated
them,
we'd
have
additional
unfair
labor
practice
charges
based
on
interference.
we
--
in
this
context,
i'm
not
sure
that
we
could
have
gotten
by
with
interviewing
these
two
people
who
we
believe
had
threatened
to
dynamite
the
plant.
but
this
is
the
limit
of
the
investigation.
we
could
have
reported
to
the
police.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
police
would've
done
much
at
this
level.
this
is
always
the
real
problem
in
labor
practice
and
labor
cases.
you've
got
a
threat
to
dynamite.
it's
hard
sometimes
to
get
any
relief.
mr.
erle
phillips
right.
mr.
erle
phillips
i
won't
belabor
it,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
except
i
think
the
brief
here
has
gone
beyond
and
the
argument
does
emanate
that
maybe
we
don't
have
good
faith.
but
the
purposes
of
--
mr.
erle
phillips
right.
mr.
erle
phillips
well
--
mr.
erle
phillips
well,
the
lawyer
that
tried
the
case,
mr.
chief
justice
tried
it
on
the
theory
of
rubins
brothers
--
rubin
brothers
which
is
that
a
good
faith
belief
is
a
defense
and
i
think
he
felt
it
was
unnecessary
to
call
pate
--
to
make
out
our
defense
and
while
the
general
counsel
didn't
call
him
in,
i
don't
know.
mr.
erle
phillips
well,
mr.
justice
brennan,
this
--
the
court
really
--
when
i
speak
of
rubin
brothers
here,
i'm
speaking
of
the
fifth
circuit
decision.
mr.
erle
phillips
now,
the
board
called
rubin
brothers
as
the
same
which
the
circuit
would
not
enforce
--
mr.
erle
phillips
right.
mr.
erle
phillips
yes
sir,
that's
the
circuit.
that's
the
fifth
circuit
approach.
now,
i
think
--
i
think
this
with
respect
to
the
8
(a)
(3)
violation.
i
will
focus,
if
i
may
a
little
bit
about
that
first
because
again
the
board
never
brought
up
this
8
(a)
(1)
theory
in
the
circuit
court.
first
time
we
ran
into
this
was
in
this
court.
i
don't
really
think
they
mean
this
unless
they
are
asking
this
court
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
any
--
any
act
of
discharge
is
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(1).
and
i
don't
believe
they
really
want
to
say
that
because
if
they
did,
i
submit
this
court
wasted
a
lot
of
time
in
for
instance
erie
resistor
in
talking
about
lack
of
motivation
and
dispensability
of
motivation
because
if
the
board
is
correct
now,
you
could
have
just
said,
“well,
it's
an
8
(a)
(1)
violation.
the
remedy
is
the
same
so
let's
forget
about
8
(a)
(3).”
but
in
general,
this
court
has
held
that
motive
is
an
essential
element
of
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(3).
this
court
has
--
has
said
on
many
occasions
that
employees
can
be
fired
for
no
reason.
the
act
permits
a
discharge
for
any
reason
other
than
union
activity
or
agitation
for
collective
bargaining
with
employees.
now,
over
the
years,
there
have
been
some
exceptions
ground
out.
now,
i
submit
these
exceptions
are
fairly
narrow.
i
think
you
can
sum
them
up
this
way
that
you
can
dispense
with
specific
evidence
of
intent,
in
a
section
8
(a)
(3)
situation,
where
you've
got
two
factors.
one
that
the
discrimination
itself
is
based
on
the
criterion
of
union
membership
or
some
phase
of
union
activity,
and
then
two,
that
the
discouragement
of
union
membership
is
natural
and
foreseeable.
and
mr.
justice
black
as
i
recall
joined
by
mr.
justice
--
mr.
justice
douglas
dissented
in
the
radio
officers
case
on
this
point
and
said
you
have
to
require
motivation
in
every
8
(a)
(3)
situation
but
the
majority
held
otherwise.
now,
the
case
is
that
if
one
analyze
them,
let's
take
erie
resistor
which
is
an
easy
one,
the
superseniority
case.
here,
the
act
of
discrimination
was
clearly
based
on
union
membership
or
a
lack
of
union
membership.
in
other
words,
if
you
were
a
non-union
and
come
to
work,
you
get
superseniority;
two
if
you
lead
the
strike,
you
get
superseniority.
clearly,
this
is
a
discrimination
based
on
union
membership.
then
the
second
aspect
quite
obviously
if
superseniority
is
law,
it
destroys
the
probability
of
union
in
the
particular
plant
involved.
so
this
--
this
case
clearly
meant
both
of
these
tests.
one
that
the
discrimination
itself
is
based
on
union
membership
with
some
aspect
of
it
and
two,
that
there'll
be
clearly
foreseeable
encouragement
or
discouragement.
well,
your
radio
officer's
case
is
the
same
thing.
in
radio
officers,
the
radio
officer
couldn't
get
a
job
because
he
didn't
clear
it
to
the
union.
once
again,
the
discrimination
was
based
on
his
failure
to
observe
union
rules.
clearly,
the
effect
there
was
to
drive
people
in
the
union
so
you
have
both
motives
again
tested.
gehner,
the
same
thing
as
you
--
as
the
court
will
recall,
this
is
a
case
of
the
called
union
and
the
company
and
the
union
negotiate
in
the
contract
which
provided
for
an
increase
for
union
members
but
no
increase
for
the
non-union
members.
once
again,
the
discrimination,
no
fee
increase,
the
basis
for
it,
non
--
lack
of
membership
in
the
union.
and
once
again,
the
other
factor
of
emphasizing
or
encouraging
union
membership
is
present.
so
i
think
that
in
all
of
these
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
and
republic
is
the
same.
republic
and
(inaudible)
are
the
same
thing.
in
all
of
these
cases,
the
discrimination
on
the
one
hand
has
been
based
on
some
aspects
of
union
membership
while
on
the
other
hand
there
has
certainly
been
a
clearly
foreseeable
encouragement
or
discouragement
of
membership.
now,
the
--
this
case
is
here,
i
assume,
because
of
the
conflict
between
the
circuits
and
i'm
not
sure
that
this
is
really
a
conflict.
the
first
case
is
industrial
cotton
mills,
n.l.r.b.
versus
industrial
cotton
mills.
in
that
case,
there
was
an
economic
striker
who
was
refused
reinstatement
when
he
--
when
the
company
had
a
good
faith
but
mistaken
belief
that
he
had
thrown
tax
in
the
street,
only
if
he'd
thrown
tax
maybe
he'd
thrown
matches.
now
again,
in
the
radio
officer,
mr.
justice
black
distinguish
this
case.
he
says
that
none
of
this
case
is
important
here
since
he
thinks
the
board
made
findings
of
the
employer's
purpose.
but
aside
from
that
statement,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
industrial
cotton
mills
is
distinguishable
because
it
is
a
strike
situation
and
because
of
the
provisions
of
section
2
point
--
section
2
(3)
of
the
act
and
section
13
of
the
act.
now,
the
congress
in
its
wisdom
has
--
has
extended
i
think
more
protections
to
the
right
to
strike
than
it
has
to
other
situations.
and
the
court
in
deciding
this
--
the
court
of
appeals
in
deciding
industrial
cotton,
made
reference
to
these
sections
of
the
act.
first,
section
13
says,
nothing
in
this
act
except
this
specifically
provided
for
herein
shall
be
construed
so
as
to
interfere
with
or
impede
or
diminish
in
any
way
the
right
to
strike
or
to
affect
the
limitations
or
qualifications
on
that
right.
when
it
--
if
the
court
will
recognize
that
law
itself
gives
extended
protection
to
a
striker,
to
an
un
--
unreplaced
economic
striker
for
example
then
it
follows
that
such
a
--
such
a
person
as
a
matter
of
law
is
entitled
to
have
his
job
back
unless
in
fact
he
has
done
something
wrong.
mistaken
belief
then
will
not
prevail
even
in
good
faith
in
the
case
of
a
strike.
but
this
is
--
this
is
because
of
the
specific
provisions
of
the
law,
protecting
the
right
to
strike.
now,
cusano
is
a
case
in
which
there
was
not
a
strike.
i
think
again
that
cusano
can
be
distinguished
on
this
basis.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
employer
fired
a
particular
man
who
was
the
leader
of
the
union
because
he
came
back
from
a
meeting
with
the
board,
with
the
employer
for
the
purpose
of
arranging
consent
election
and
made
a
report
to
the
union
committee.
now
this
is
what
the
board
found
that
he
was
fired
for
doing.
they
didn't
--
the
board
didn't
actually
find
that
this
man
was
fired
for
misstating
something
although
there
was
an
argument
as
to
what
he
did
say.
the
employer
said
that
the
man
came
back
and
misstated
profits
that
he
used
to
figure
over
half
a
million
as
being
profits
when
in
reality
that
figure
had
reference
to
the
sales
and
purchases
of
the
company.
but
the
board
in
its
finding
made
a
clear
statement
that
the
facts
as
established
that
the
respondent
discharged
palladino
because
of
his
activities
on
behalf
of
the
union
in
reporting
to
the
shop
committee
what
had
occurred
at
the
board
conference.
i
think
if
--
if
--
if
this
is
realized
that
--
that
the
board
affirmed
by
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
man
was
fired
for
his
protected
activity
in
making
the
report
to
the
committee,
then
again,
the
case
is
distinguishable
from
the
present
case
which
involves
a
good
faith
but
mistaken
belief
as
to
wrongful
activity.
now,
of
course
if
--
the
--
if
the
court
here
should
disagree
with
this
then
we
would
have
to
recognize
that
cusano
is
simply
in
conflict
with
this.
there's
one
other
case
on
which
board
relies
that's
cambria
clay,
another
circuit
court
case
and
of
course
that
was
a
strike
situation
and
we
put
that
in
the
same
category
as
industrial
cotton
mills.
now,
the
board
--
the
board
claims
that
on
many
occasions,
rubin
has
been
followed.
i've
tried
to
read
the
cases
cited
in
the
board
brief
and
others
and
in
general
those
cases
are
distinguishable.
one,
that
strike
situations
were
involved.
two,
that
when
you
really
read
the
decision,
the
board
made
a
finding
of
bad
faith
not
good
faith.
and
so
it
was
never
necessary
to
reach
the
question
of
a
good
faith
but
mistaken
belief.
for
instance
in
(inaudible)
one
case
is
cited
by
the
board
in
its
brief
that
was
a
strike
situation.
patterson-sargent
company
was
a
strike
situation.
this
doctrine
hasn't
been
widespread.
now,
with
--
with
respect
to
section
8
(a)
(3)
then,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
was
correct
and
proper.
we've
shown
on
the
one
hand
that
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
where
motivation
has
been
dispensed
with,
that
there
--
there
had
been
--
there
had
been
a
narrow
exception
and
these
are
situation
where
the
discrimination
itself
was
based
on
union
membership
and
union
activity.
you
had
clearly
foreseeable
discouragement
or
encouragement
of
union
membership
or
union
activity.
i've
tried
to
show
the
court
here
that
second
case
industrial
cotton
is
not
in
--
in
conflict
with
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
because
it
was
a
strike
situation
and
you've
got
a
different
rule
applicable
to
a
strike
situation.
cusano
is
distinguishable
because
it
involved
a
discharge
for
engagement
in
protected
activity.
the
man
was
fired
because
he
made
a
report
to
the
union
committee.
now,
in
this
case,
if
the
rule
is
still
to
be
that
an
employer
has
a
right
to
fire
an
employee
for
no
reason,
for
an
arbitrary
reason,
an
unreasonable
reason,
any
reason
of
an
engagement
in
protected
activity,
then
it
has
to
follow
that
the
employer
has
the
right
to
fire
an
employee
because
of
the
mistaken
but
good
faith
belief
that
he
has
done
something
wrong,
in
this
case,
a
threat
to
dynamite
the
plant
which
under
federal
law
is
a
felony.
if
you
can
fire
the
man
for
nothing,
no
reason,
then
does
it
have
to
follow
that
he
can
fire
the
man
for
a
good
faith
but
mistaken
belief
as
to
some
wrongful
conduct?
now,
the
board
--
the
board
seems
to
say,
well,
maybe
so
but
in
this
situation,
the
man
was
engaged
or
the
men
were
engaged
in
protected
activity
and
it's
true
that
these
fellows
where
engaged
in
solicitation
of
membership.
but
in
soliciting
for
membership,
these
two
fellows
did
not
have
to
make
any
threat
to
dynamite
the
plant.
and
i
think
therefore
that
that
this
is
a
separable
type
of
activity.
on
the
one
hand,
they
were
soliciting
for
membership,
this
is
protected.
we
couldn't
fire
them
for
that,
we
didn't
fire
them
for
that
and
again
--
mr.
erle
phillips
well
again,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
it
gets
back
to
the
proposition
if
we
can
fire
him
for
no
reason.
we
just
don't
like
them.
we
don't
like
what
it
looks,
some
arbitrary
reason.
the
foreman
gets
mad
at
me.
if
we
had
this
right
still
then
it
probably
can
fire
him
because
of
the
good
faith
but
mistaken
belief.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
this
is
distinguishable
from
the
situation
in
cusano
because
there,
all
you
have
was
the
engagement
of
protected
activity.
that's
what
they
were
fired
for.
that's
what
these
men
were
fired
for
here.
well,
you
really
two
activities.
on
the
one
hand
these
two
fellows
where
trying
to
get
somebody
to
join
the
union,
soliciting
membership.
but
on
the
other
hand,
we
believe
in
good
faith
that
they
were
threatened
to
blow
up
our
plant.
and
this
again,
mr.
justice
harlan
raise
a
question,
what
do
you
do?
how
long
do
you
wait?
in
florida,
in
the
last
couple
of
years,
there's
been
a
good
lead
of
dynamite
that
was
going
on
next
with
the
f.e.c.
strike.
so
it's
not
--
it's
not
something
you
can
pass
off
by
saying
this
is
ridiculous.
you
don't
ever
have
this
problem.
you
do
have
this
problem,
you
do
have
dynamites.
so
if
you
think
you
can
accept
the
proposition
that
on
the
one
hand,
cases
of
this,
which
case
is
decided
by
this
court
such
as
erie
resistor
and
the
others
are
distinguishable.
two,
that
industrial
cotton
mills
is
--
is
distinguishable
because
it
is
a
strike
situation
entitled
to
special
consideration
by
virtue
of
section
2,
4
and
3
and
section
13
of
the
act
and
that
cusano
is
different
and
the
ground
for
discharge
was
for
the
concerted
activity.
while
here,
the
discharge
was
made
because
of
a
good
faith
but
mistaken
belief
that
while
engaging
into
protected
activity,
these
men
made
a
threat
which
certainly
true,
we
all
admit
would
have
been
ground
for
discharge.
mr.
erle
phillips
yes
sir.
mr.
erle
phillips
yes
sir.
mr.
erle
phillips
i
don't
think
it
would
have
if
there
had
been
contract
for
a
year
mr.
justice
black
but
there
was
not
a
contract
for
a
year.
mr.
erle
phillips
there
was
not
a
contract
for
a
year.
mr.
erle
phillips
this
is
what
--
this
is
what
this
piece
gets
down
to
of
course.
i
submit
that
if
the
man
may
be
discharged
by
his
employer
without
having
any
reason
which
this
court
has
said
time
and
time
again
can
happen.
we
didn't
have
to
have
injuries
in
the
crime.
then
we
--
we
--
we
--
we
are
entitled
to
find
if
we
have
a
good
faith
belief
that
he
is
engaged
in
wrongful
activity.
mr.
erle
phillips
well
--
mr.
erle
phillips
mr.
justice
brennan,
there's
nothing
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
which
indicates
that
we
--
we
violated
section
8
(a)
(3)
and
indeed
this
is
--
this
is
the
part
of
the
problem.
there's
no
finding
here
of
any
motivation
--
mr.
erle
phillips
right.
mr.
erle
phillips
yes
sir.
mr.
erle
phillips
yes,
but
i
think
--
i
recognize
that
this
court
can
do
most
anything
that
it
wishes
with
a
case
such
as
this,
but
with
--
mr.
erle
phillips
no
i'm
talking
first
--
mr.
erle
phillips
well,
i
think
the
board
could
have
petitioned
this
court
to
review
the
whole
case
below.
mr.
erle
phillips
but
it
did
not
and
under
your
established
practice,
as
i
understand
it,
your
review
is
going
to
be
limited
to
the
question
raised
by
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
board
specifically
on
page
6
of
the
petition
for
that
certiorari,
i
think
had
no
--
i
mean
footnote
6,
we
waived,
we're
not
questioning
the
right.
mr.
erle
phillips
no
sir,
this
reduces
it
to
the
question
again
of,
is
a
good
faith
but
mistaken
belief
sufficient
to
justify
the
discharge?
the
remedy
mr.
justice
white
is
the
same.
mr.
erle
phillips
alright
sir.
mr.
erle
phillips
well
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
this
is
--
this
is
probably
a
question
that
the
court
must
decide.
mr.
erle
phillips
oh,
no
sir.
no
sir.
the
entire
argument
in
the
court
below
was
addressed
to
an
8
(a)
(3)
violation.
in
this
court,
they
are
saying,
“well,
it's
either
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(1)
or
8
(a)
(3).”
mr.
erle
phillips
right.
mr.
erle
phillips
as
i
understand
the
argument
from
the
brief
and
from
what
general
counsel
stated,
they
still
argue
on
both
grounds.
it's
just
a
little
easier
maybe
if
they
can
make
an
8
(a)
(1)
stand
up
than
8
(a)
(3)
because
there's
been
no
finding
here
--
mr.
erle
phillips
i'm
not
sure
that
i
followed
you
but
the
problem
from
--
the
problem
with
the
board's
case
on
an
8
(a)
(3)
is
that
they've
got
to
prove
motivation
which
they
haven't
proven.
now,
from
the
standpoint
of
an
8
(a)
(1),
i
think
it's
probably
easy
to
prove
an
8
(a)
(1)
because
i
don't
think
you
have
to
prove
motivation,
you
don't
have
to
think
--
i
don't
think
this
court
needs
tell
you.
you
don't
have
to
prove
that
the
interference
was
successful
or
unsuccessful
interference.
mr.
erle
phillips
yes
sir.
yes,
the
remedy
is
the
same
as
i
--
within
the
board's
discretion.
now,
there's
whole
lot
of
cases.
they
fall
in
two
categories,
the
supervisory
discharges.
they
can't
be
8
(a)
(3)
because
the
supervisor
is
not
an
employee,
so
this
is
an
8
(a)
(1).
the
remedy
is
to
reinstate
with
back
pay.
then
there
are
another
whole
lot
of
cases
where
discharge
not
found
to
be
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(3)
is
found
to
be
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(1).
this
is
where
there
is
usually
concerted
activity
but
no
--
no
necessary
union
activity.
no
union
in
the
picture.
men
walk
off
in
concert
but
you
can't
prove
the
effect
of
encouragement
or
discouragement.
you
can't
prove
bad
motivation
but
yet
they
did
act
in
concert.
i
can
--
i
can
see
this
a
little
--
i
don't
think
this
problem
is
--
is
in
conflict
with
my
problem
here
with
this
case
because
there,
if
three
men
walk
off
the
job
in
concert
and
are
fired
for
that.
that
is
an
8
(a)
(1),
that's
interference
i
think.
mr.
erle
phillips
yes
sir.
mr.
erle
phillips
that's
my
understanding
of
the
board's
position.
mr.
erle
phillips
yes
sir.
mr.
erle
phillips
well,
as
i
understand
the
board's
position,
it's
reinstatement
either
way
with
back
pay.
mr.
erle
phillips
yes
sir.
there's
got
to
be
--
mr.
erle
phillips
well,
yes
sir.
mr.
erle
phillips
there
must
be
finding.
now,
to
sum
up
on
8
(a)
(1),
i
recognize
that
motivation
is
immaterial.
i
recognize
you
don't
have
to
show
that
the
interference
is
successful,
but
in
all
these
cases,
the
things
i
just
mentioned
a
moment
ago
have
been
present
either
supervisory
status
or
discharge
for
concerted
activity
which
was
short
and
all
of
this,
i
think
the
case
is
of
the
same
acquiesce
and
the
court
affirm
the
lower
court.
