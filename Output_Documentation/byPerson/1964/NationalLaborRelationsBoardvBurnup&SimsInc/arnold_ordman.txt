mr.
arnold
ordman
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
that
court
denied
enforcement
to
a
board
order
which
directed
reinstatement
with
back
pay
of
two
employees
who
have
been
discharged.
the
question
presented
for
resolution
by
this
court
is
whether
an
employer
may
lawfully
discharge
employees
who
are
engaging
in
activities
protected
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
in
this
case,
the
activity
was
soliciting
employees
for
membership
in
the
union,
whether
you
may
discharge
such
employees
lawfully,
merely
because
he
has
a
mistaken
belief
that
in
the
course
of
that
protected
activity,
the
employees
engaged
in
certain
misconduct
which
would
have
justified
the
discharge.
the
board
held
that
the
mistaken
belief
did
not
exonerate
the
employer
and
the
court
below
held
that
it
did.
the
facts
are
simple
and
undisputed.
the
company
was
a
florida
corporation
engaged
in
business
in
melbourne,
florida
where
it
manufactured
and
sold
concrete
products.
the
employees
of
the
company
were
not
organized
but
in
september
of
1961,
the
employees
engaged
in
a
walkout
in
support
of
a
demand
for
wage
increase.
among
the
leaders
of
this
walkout
were
the
two
employees
who
was
discharged
and
we're
concerned
about
here
named
harmon
and
davis
and
a
third
employee
named
mcknight.
the
walkout
and
the
wage
dispute
were
soon
resolved.
the
employees
went
back
to
work
but
not
long
thereafter,
davis,
harmon
and
mcknight
were
discharged
allegedly
for
lack
of
work
with
the
understanding
that
if
that
be
recalled
as
soon
as
the
volume
of
work
resumed.
now,
the
board
found
in
this
case
that
this
layoff,
that
the
alleged
lack
of
work
was
a
pretext
and
actually
the
three
employees
were
laid
off
because
they
engaged
in
union
activity
and
the
court
below
accepted
that
finding
and
that
part
of
the
court
case
is
not
before
this
court
but
it
serves
to
explain
the
events
which
immediately
followed.
mcknight,
the
third
employee
was
put
back
to
work
in
normal
force
but
davis
and
harmon
were
never
brought
back
to
work.
it
seems
that
right
after
the
wage
dispute,
davis
went
to
a
local
union
affiliated
with
the
teamsters
and
an
organizational
campaign
started
in
attempt
to
organize
a
campaign.
but
davis
and
harmon
were
very
active
in
the
organizational
campaign
and
solicited
employees
at
their
homes
for
membership
in
the
union.
now,
one
of
the
employees
solicited
was
a
fellow
named
pate.
he
orally
reported
to
the
superintendent
of
the
company
and
in
turn
reported
to
the
manager
that
davis
and
harmon
had
come
to
his
home
and
had
solicited
his
membership
in
the
union.
but
in
the
course
of
that
solicitation,
he
said,
one
of
them
threatened
that
he
was
going
to
--
that
if
the
union
did
not
get
in
--
get
into
the
plant,
one
of
them
was
going
to
dynamite
the
gravel
bins
in
the
plant
and
make
it
impossible
for
anybody
to
work.
now,
when
the
company
got
this
information,
it
was
understandably
disturbed.
there
was
consultation
with
counsel
and
about
12
days
later
in
the
presence
of
company
counsel,
the
company
got
a
statement
under
oath,
an
affidavit
from
this
employee
named
pate
in
which
in
substance
he
repeated
what
he
had
stated
in
the
oral
report.
but
with
the
discrepancy
about
whether
davis
or
harmon
had
made
the
threat
but
i
do
not
think
that
is
material
here.
again,
the
company
took
no
further
action
thereafter
for
two
weeks.
they
got
the
sworn
affidavit
on
october
25th.
two
weeks
later
on
november
8th,
the
company
manager
sent
letters
of
discharge
to
the
two
employees,
davis
and
harmon
saying
in
essence,
we
had
laid
you
off
last
september
with
the
understanding
that
once
business
picked
up,
we'd
put
you
back
to
work.
but
business
has
picked
up
but
we
are
not
going
to
put
you
back
to
work
because
in
the
words
of
the
manager
in
the
letter,
says,
“it
has
come
to
my
attention
that
you
made
or
condoned
serious
threats
to
damage
property
of
the
company
should
the
union
fail
to
win
the
election.”
now,
from
the
company's
point
of
view,
if
the
court
please,
this
threat
was
a
very
serious
threat.
threat
to
dynamite
is
serious
and
it
was
maybe
more
serious
because
as
the
company
knew
harmon,
one
of
the
two
employees
involved,
had
even
had
a
little
experience
on
the
job
of
working
with
a
dynamite.
but
other
than
obtaining
a
sworn
affidavit
from
pate,
from
this
employee
who
made
the
oral
report,
the
company
made
no
investigation
of
the
matter
whatever.
it
didn't
inquire
from
harmon
and
davis
as
to
whether
they
have
made
the
threat
and
it
didn't
initiate
any
investigation
of
any
kind
that
even
a
police
investigation
which
as
respondent
tells
us
in
his
brief
might
have
been
justified
because
this
was
a
felony,
threatening
to
blow
up
the
plant
was
a
felony
under
florida
law
punishable
by
20
years
--
as
much
as
a
20-year
sentence.
now,
the
only
action
he
did
take
10
days
after
they
receive
the
report
and
after
--
two
weeks
after
they
received
the
statement
under
oath
was
to
write
a
letter
of
discharge.
now,
i
almost
wanted
to
comment
in
a
lighter
vain
whether
this
was
a
kind
of
course
--
whether
this
course
of
conduct
is
way
of
handling
the
threat
was
exactly
the
way
to
win
friends
or
influence
dynamite
as
might
leave
some
doubt
at
least
in
a
serious
way.
a
threat
to
dynamite
a
plant
is
so
serious
as
to
suggest
that
maybe
more
serious
measures
should
have
been
taken
if
the
security
of
the
plant
was
to
be
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
case
doesn't
turn
on
this
but
these
are
the
countervailing
interest
which
in
our
view
the
board
had
to
balance
when
it
reached
its
final
determination.
we
are
assuming
--
we
are
assuming
for
purposes
of
this
case
that
good
faith
of
the
employer
that
he
believed
the
threat
was
made.
mr.
arnold
ordman
the
board
made
its
final
attempt
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
the
board
made
--
the
board
made
two
findings
in
this
case.
it
predicated
explaining
on
two
grounds.
the
first
one
was
that
the
discharge
by
the
employer
was
in
essence
that
it
was
agreed
that
the
threat
that
the
company
seized
upon
the
threat
is
a
pretext,
so
that
wasn't
its
real
reason.
the
board
found
as
one
of
its
grounds
that
the
threat
being
a
pretext.
the
real
reason
for
the
discharge
was
the
dynamiting.
now,
the
court
below
didn't
talk
about
that
finding
but
we
must
assume
it
rejected
it.because
it
is
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
we
are
--
we
are
not.
we
think
the
court
below
or
we
must
assume
the
court
below
rejected
the
pretext
theory
that
the
board
had
advanced
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
and
i
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
we
think
it
does
but
we
concluded
in
framing
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
respondent
correcting
points
about
it,
maybe
this
was
the
kind
of
fact
issue
on
which
we
did
not
want
a
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
question
representing
the
petition
for
certiorari
is
the
second
ground
upon
which
the
board
decided
this
case
namely,
assuming
and
we
do
assume
in
this
case
a
good
faith
belief
on
the
part
of
the
employer
that
these
people
had
engaged
in
misconduct.
if
in
fact
as
the
record
here
affirmatively
shows
the
misconduct
did
not
occur,
the
threat
was
not
made,
the
board
finds
that
the
employees
are
entitled
to
the
guaranty
of
section
7
to
engage
in
protected
activity
which
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
i
think
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
i
think
the
court
described
--
i
think
that
mr.
justice
brennan,
if
i'm
correct
on
that
and
i
think
the
court
would
be
free
to
do
so.
however,
i
must
candidly
acknowledge
that
we
did
not
urge
that
question.
in
fact,
it
was
waived
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
arnold
ordman
the
question
that
we
present
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
--
in
the
petition
is
namely,
assuming
as
we
do
here
that
the
petition
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
that's
right.
the
board
may
--
(voice
overlap)
an
alternative
ground
for
that
decision.
mr.
arnold
ordman
it
assumes
that
this
threat
had
been
made
that
the
employer
honestly
believed
that
it
has
been
made.
but
the
board
made
a
further
finding
and
these
findings
are
accepted
by
the
court
below
that
the
threat,
in
fact,
had
not
been
made.
there
was
no
evidence
to
whatever
the
threat
had
been
made.
the
company
didn't
even
offer
a
proof
that
the
threat
had
actually
been
made.
and
the
second
ground
upon
which
the
board
made
its
finding
and
the
ground
upon
which
the
court
below
ruled
is
that
where
these
charges
are
made
on
the
basis
of
a
mistaken
belief
that
misconduct
has
occurred
in
the
course
of
an
activity
protected
by
section
7
but
where
the
record
affirmatively
shows
that
the
misconduct
did
not
occur,
then
the
board
finds
that
the
discharge
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
section
8
(a)
(3)
of
one
of
the
act.
and
that's
the
posture
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
a
good
faith
mistaken
belief.
now
the
court
below
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
correct
you
honor.
the
court
below,
the
fifth
circuit
has
held
twice
now
that
a
good
faith
and
mistaken
belief
as
it
held
in
this
case
is
a
defense
and
that
once
an
employer
has
a
good
faith
belief,
that
an
employee
has
engaged
in
a
misconduct,
whether
the
employee
has
or
has
not
engaged
in
misconduct
is
an
irrelevant
circumstance
as
the
court
below
put
it
no
matter
what
the
circumstances
are
and
the
respondent
also
claims
that
motivation
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
we
did
ask
for
it
from
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
we
did
ask.
we
asked
it
on
both
grounds.
we
argued
both
grounds
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
--
below.
mr.
arnold
ordman
i
might
suggest
respectfully
to
you
mr.
justice
brennan
that
we
have
in
the
national
labor
relations
board
approximately
280
cases
last
year
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
in
a
number
of
those,
we
are
reversed
on
factual
determinations.
we
do
not
feel
free
to
bring
to
the
court
every
instance
where
we're
reversed
on
a
factual
determination.
we
regarded
this
as
one
of
those
cases
and
we
didn't
think
we
ought
to
burden
the
court
with
the
volume
of
litigation
we
have
on
what
we
assume
the
court
below
really
reversed
us
on
what
it
assumed
to
be
a
factual
determination.
the
pretext
was
not
the
reason.
that's
why
we're
here.
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
right.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now,
on
the
proposition
that
where
a
concern
--
where
there
is
a
mistaken
belief
that
so-called
was
a
mistaken
belief
doctrine
as
i
indicate
that
the
court
below
doesn't
agree
with
us
and
neither
this
respondent.
and
i
assume
that
a
good
faith
belief
is
always
sufficient.
now,
this
occurs
in
the
context
of
where
the
employees
in
fact
were
engaged
in
a
protected
activity,
the
activity
and
the
only
activity.
the
employees
were
engaged
in
here
with
soliciting
union
membership
which
falls
as
we
see
it
within
the
specific
rubric
of
section
7
of
the
act.
in
other
words,
there
is
a
guaranteed
right
to
employees
to
“form,
join
or
assist
labor
organizations”.
so
the
only
activity
they
were
engaged
in
was
one
specifically
guaranteed.
now,
the
unfair
labor
practice
provisions
of
the
act
are
designed
to
protect
that
guaranty.
in
section
8
(a)
(1)
in
blanket
terms
as
it's
an
interference
of
an
employer,
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
interfere
with,
restrain
or
coerce
employees
in
the
exercise
any
of
the
section
7
rights.
now,
the
remaining
unfair
labor
practice
provisions
are
just
tailor-made
provisions
designed
to
reach
specific
kinds
of
violations
that
the
congress
was
concerned
about
but
section
8
(a)
(1)
subsumes
them
all.
now,
in
this
case,
we
don't
think
we
have
to
reach
even
section
8
(a)
(3),
which
says
you
can't
discriminate
against
an
employee
to
encourage
or
discourage
membership.
we
think
8
(a)
(1)
is
enough.
once
we
start
with
the
proposition
that
solicitation
is
a
protected
activity,
we
think
section
7
covers
it
and
section
8
(a)
(1)
makes
an
unfair
labor
practice.
if
these
individuals
had
been
discharged
for
engaging
in
solicitation
of
union
membership,
the
violation
would
have
been
clear,
we'd
have
no
argument.
this
was
i
guess
what
the
--
and
not
what
this
court
decided
in
the
republic
aviation
case
in
1945.
but
the
respondent
argues,
we
didn't
discharge
these
people
for
engaging
solicitation,
we
discharged
them
for
threatening
to
dynamite
the
plant.
but
when
we
examined
the
facts,
we
find
that
the
dynamiting
did
not
take
--
the
threat
had
not
been
made.
if
the
threat
had
been
made
and
in
the
posture
of
the
case
has,
we
have
it
here
before
this
court,
the
board
would
have
found
no
unfair
labor
practice.
it
would
have
applied
the
test
this
court
laid
down
in
republic
mainly
where
you
must
weigh,
first,
the
statutory
rights
of
the
employees
to
engage
in
organizational
activity
as
against
the
countervailing
interest
of
the
employer,
his
undisputed
interest
to
protect
his
property
or
to
maintain
discipline
in
his
operation
to
safeguard
his
business
operation.
but
we
have
here
only
one
half
of
the
equation.
you
have
the
undisputed
right
of
the
employees
to
engage
in
organizational
activity
but
in
fact,
you
have
no
threat.
the
board
so
found
and
the
court
below
accepted
this
finding.
you
have
no
threat
to
dynamite
the
property
so
you
only
have
the
republic
half
of
the
equation
and
we
think
under
these
circumstances,
the
good
faith
belief
of
the
employer
that
these
people
intended
to
dynamite
the
plant
is
no
more
of
a
defense
to
him
than
say
the
lack
of
anti-union
motivation
which
you
had
in
the
republic
case.
now,
this
is
the
theory
which
was
adopted
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
in
the
context
of
this
case,
and
looking
at
it,
this
employer
as
i
suggested,
the
extent
of
the
investigation,
the
employer
made
is
madly
doubtful.
however,
we'll
assume
it's
a
good
faith.
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes
sir.
mr.
arnold
ordman
yes
sir.
mr.
arnold
ordman
right.
mr.
arnold
ordman
i
think
you're
correct
your
honor
and
i
would
suggest
this.
this
is
not
a
case
where
we
have
to
--
where
we're
seeking
blame
or
censure
of
the
employer.
we
are
not
a
penal
statute.
we're
a
remedial
statute.
as
against
the
good
faith
of
the
employer
and
assuming
his
complete
good
faith
and
his
complete
innocence,
we
have
to
be
concerned
about
the
two
employees
here.
these
are
the
values
we
have
to
weigh.
now,
who
should
bear
and
this
a
position
at
least
the
fourth
circuit
adopted
in
a
similar
case,
who
should
bear
the
burden
of
this
mistake?
should
the
burden
the
bear
by
the
--
borne
by
the
employer
who
made
the
mistake
or
the
two
innocent
employees
who
did
nothing
more
than
exercise
a
right
which
congress
said
they
had.
and
they
had
no
way
of
avoiding
the
consequences
of
the
mistake
other
than
giving
up
their
statutory
right
in
the
normal
course
of
events
as
this
court
knows,
in
industrial
disputes,
rumors
fly.
now,
these
people
have
no
way
of
avoiding
the
consequence
of
that
mistake
and
our
suggestion
is
that
in
weighing
these
countervailing
interests,
we
feel
the
onus
should
rather
fall
upon
even
this
good
faith
employer
who
made
the
mistake
rather
than
on
the
innocent
victims
of
the
mistake
who
were
doing
no
more
than
exercising
the
statutory
right
that's
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
precisely.
mr.
arnold
ordman
this
is
not,
as
i
say,
is
not
a
question
of
blame
or
censure.
this
the
position
the
fourth
circuit
took
on
industrial
cotton
that
the
third
circuit
took
in
cusano
and
both
those
cases,
the
employees,
one
was
a
strike
situation,
one
was
not
a
strike
situation,
just
a
protected
activity
as
in
this
case.
in
both
those
cases,
the
courts
found
as
the
board
had
found
that
the
employees
were
engaged
in
protected
activity
but
the
employer
thought
they
were
doing,
engaged
in
misconduct
for
which
they
could
have
been
fired.
mr.
arnold
ordman
the
finding
was
that
the
threat
had
not
been
made
and
the
evidence
was
uncontradicted
and
the
company
made
no
effort
even
to
prove
that
it
had
been
made.
mr.
arnold
ordman
that
is
correct.
mr.
arnold
ordman
in
the
context
of
this
case,
a
threat
to
dynamite
the
plant,
i
think
we
can
fairly
assume
that
such
a
threat
been
made,
the
board
would
have
weighed
the
scale
in
the
other
direction.
the
safety
of
the
employer's
operation
would
more
than
accommodating
as
against
the
statutory
right
of
the
employees
to
organize.
mr.
arnold
ordman
the
only
evidence
was
and
the
only
evidence
in
the
case
was
the
report
that
they
received
from
this
employee
named
pate
who
says
these
two
people
came
to
him
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
who
said
that
these
two
employees
had
come
to
him
to
solicit
his
membership
and
that
in
the
course
of
that
solicitation,
they
had
made
this
threat
and
he
gave
them
a
sworn
affidavit.
now,
at
the
hearing,
the
evidence
as
to
the
threat
itself,
the
evidence
was
uncontradicted.
harmon
testified
that
he
did
come
to
pate's
home
to
solicit
his
membership
(voice
overlap)
at
pate's
request.
but
he
denied
that
he
had
threatened
him
or
in
any
way.
davis
testified
that
while
he
was
soliciting
for
membership
too,
he
never
even
came
to
pate's
house.pate
incidentally
was
present
at
the
board
hearing
but
nobody
called
him
as
a
witness.
and
i
think
the
company
also
points
to
the
fact
that
innocent
employees
who
would
receive
the
kind
of
letter
of
discharge
saying
that
they
have
threatened
to
--
threatened
to
blow
up
the
plant
then
innocent
employees
would
have
responded
to
this
letter
with
a
denial.
the
record
shows
the
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
the
employer
was
represented
in
the
hearing.
mr.
arnold
ordman
by
counsel.
mr.
arnold
ordman
pate
was
there
and
was
not
called.
incidentally,
the
general
counsel
of
the
board
did
not
call
him
either.
but
in
this
event,
it
shows
incidentally
these
people
did
not.
the
respondent
points
out
that
these
two
individuals
received
a
letter
saying
they
threatened
to
blow
up
the
plant
did
not
respond
to
the
letter
and
seeks
to
rely
upon
this
because
innocent
people
would.
the
record
is
clear
incidentally,
before
these
two
employees
received
this
letter
saying
they
threatened
to
blow
up
the
plant,
they
had
already
heard
rumors
about
this
accusation.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
had
already
talked
to
a
government
--
to
a
board
investigator
who
was
investigating
unfair
labor
practice
charges
connected
with
the
earlier
layoff
and
he
had
asked
them
about
this.
they
have
denied
the
story
and
as
they
testified
at
the
hearing,
when
asked
about
answering
the
letter,
they
said
in
effect,
“you
know
we
told
the
government
investigator
about
this
and
we
sort
of
felt
that
we
ought
to
leave
this
to
the
government.
we
didn't
think
we
ought
to
do
anything
further.”
the
evidence,
mr.
chief
justice
was
solely
the
oral
report
by
pate,
where
the
company
relied
on
in
the
sworn
affidavit
which
they
got
12
days
later
on
the
basis
of
which
two
weeks
later,
they
sent
the
letters
of
discharge.
now,
as
i
say
cusano
and
we
feel
that
we
can
rely
surely
on
section
1,
the
protection
of
the
statute
from
the
weight
of
these
countervailing
interests
and
section
8
(a)
(1)
covers
this.
we
don't
think
we
have
to
reach
section
8
(a)
(3).
the
respondent
places
its
entire
case
and
i
think
the
court
below
on
the
lack
of
motivation.
motivation
is
more
typical.
it's
the
typical
thing
in
an
8
(a)
(3)
case
but
we
suggest
that
this
court
has
in
a
number
of
cases
not
found
it
necessary
to
find
specific
proof
of
anti-union
motivation
even
in
8
(a)
(3)
cases.
now,
cusano
and
industrial
cotton,
the
two
cases
upon
which
we
rely
heavily,
this
court
has
several
times
cited
those
cases
on
the
proposition
that's
of
specific
proof
of
a
discriminatory
motivation
is
not
required,
necessarily
required,
for
a
section
8
(a)
(3)
finding
i
have
referenced
to
republic
itself
to
gain
news
which
this
court
--
which
this
court
decided
together
with
radio
officers
and
to
a
recent
case
of
erie
resistor.
i
believe
this
court
has
in
effect
held
as
the
board
has
held
that
where
there
is
a
--
where
the
discharges
or
other
discrimination
arise
out
of
unnecessary
connection
with
a
protected
labor
activity
that
a
sufficient
nexus
has
been
established
to
justify
a
finding
of
section
8
(a)
(3).
so
i
would
conclude
by
saying,
we
rely
on
i
think
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
statutory
guaranty
as
a
complete
substantiation
of
our
case.
we
think
8
(a)
(3)
has
also
been
violated
and
we
ask
for
reversal
of
the
judgment
below.
mr.
arnold
ordman
i
will
just
take
one
moment.
mr.
arnold
ordman
i'll
just
take
one
moment,
if
the
court
please
to
clarify
exactly
what
the
board's
position
here
is.
the
board
position
here
both
in
the
cases
we
have
focused
in
here
in
the
supreme
court
is
precisely
this.
these
employees
were
engaged
in
an
activity
protected
by
section
7
of
the
act,
a
right
guaranteed
to
them
by
section
7
of
the
act.
that
right
they
were
deprived
of,
they
were
discharged
for
exercising
that
right
because
the
employer
had
a
mistaken
good
faith
belief
that
they
were
doing
something
that
was
bad.
but
we
--
our
case
is
pitched
on
the
proposition
that
these
people
were
deprived
of
a
right
guaranteed
them
by
section
7
of
the
act
because
--
mr.
arnold
ordman
and
we
found
--
the
board
found
that
to
be
a
violation,
i
beg
your
pardon,
of
8
(a)
(1)
and
also
of
8
(a)
(3)
and
for
the
lack
of
specific
proof
of
anti-union
motivation,
we
submit
that
that
defect,
if
it
is
a
defect,
it's
the
same
sort
of
defect
which
the
board
didn't,
or
which
the
court,
the
supreme
court
found
no
handicap
either
on
radio
officers
or
in
erie
resistor
or
in
republic.
thank
you,
your
honor.
