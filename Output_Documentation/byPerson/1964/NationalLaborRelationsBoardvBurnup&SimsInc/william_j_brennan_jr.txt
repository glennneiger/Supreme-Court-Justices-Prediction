justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
a
little
confused
mr.
ordman.
are
you
asking
us
to
defend
the
board's
finding
here
on
the
basis
that
there
was
--
this
was
a
mere
pretext
for
the
discharge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
understand
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
am
i
wrong
about
this?
i
thought
of
the
universal
tenet
if
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
conclusion
of
the
board
that
this
was
merely
a
pretext
and
that
then
this
had
some
bearing
on
the
power
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
set
aside
the
board's
conclusion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
may
want
in
maybe
a
matter
of
interest
to
the
board
and
generally
to
the
profession
will
someday
decide
that
question
but
are
you
in
position
to
abandon
that?
i
--
i
thought
--
i
thought
it
has
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
revision
put
limitations
on
what
the
court
of
appeals
might
do
in
setting
aside
the
board's
factual
conclusion
and
that
our
responsibility
here
was
to
see
that
the
courts
of
appeals
adhered
to
the
congressional
standing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
understand
mr.
ordman,
that
your
enforcement
petition
in
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
ask
enforcement
based
on
the
finding
of
pretext?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
did?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
must
say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
really
troubled
how
you
can
wash
that
out
and
come
here.
i'm
thinking
now
in
the
context
of
the
taft-hartley
amendment
to
the
circuit
court
review
on
enforcement
petition
is
on
limitation
as
i
understood
it
that
taft-hartley
imposed
on
this
court's
review.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
just
this
--
i
understand
correctly
mr.
ordman.
the
finding
that
was
made
was
that
in
fact
the
threat
has
not
been
made.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
it's
in
that
--
it's
in
that
setting
that
the
board
made
the
accommodation
between
the
interests
that
you
suggest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
did
i
understand
you
to
say,
had
the
finding
been
otherwise,
had
the
finding
been
that
indeed
the
threat
was
made,
then
the
accommodation
would
have
resulted
in
--
for
the
employer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
the
employer
represented
at
the
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
counsel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
pate
was
there
and
was
not
called?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you're
saying
mr.
phillips
is
rubin
brothers
as
you
applied
it
or
as
--
and
as
you
think
the
examiner
applied
it
holds
that
even
if
pate
was
not
telling
the
truth
about
the
threat,
if
you
were
--
honestly
believe
he
did,
that's
a
sufficient
offense.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
whosever
decision
is,
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
that
the
approach?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
except
that
you
also
have
the
finding
that
indeed
he
was
--
they
were
discharged
for
union
activities.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
the
--
and
--
and
as
i
gather,
the
issue
really
is
whether
you
may
escape
the
ordinary
consequence
of
a
discharge
for
union
activity
namely,
reinstatement,
why
the
fact
that
you
had
a
good
faith
belief
said
indeed
they've
certainly
violated
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
getting
back
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
board's
view
is
that
there
was
a
finding
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
ordinarily
to
be
redressed
by
an
order
of
reinstatement
unless
in
this
case,
the
fact
that
you
had
a
good
faith
belief
that
they
threatened
to
dynamite
the
plant
absolved
you
from
the
ordinary
order
of
that
issue,
got
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
--
i
had
to
disagree
with
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
our
powers
of
review
as
i
tried
to
suggest
to
mr.
ordman
are
quite
limited
on
this
kind
of
situation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
not
suggesting,
are
you,
that
the
board's
position
is
that
without
a
finding
of
an
8
(a)
(1)
or
an
8
(a)
(3),
it
has
to
be
one
of
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
the
board's
position
is
that
they
may
nevertheless
order
reinstatement
merely
because
they
find
that
the
--
there
was
a
mistaken
although
good
faith
beliefs
that
these
fellows
have
threatened
to
dynamite?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
really?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
didn't
get
that
from
mr.
ordman
but
we're
going
to
hear
from
him
again.
i
thought
he
tagged
this
definitely
to
an
unfair
labor
practice
violation
which
is
i
heard
him,
he
thought
was
either
8
(a)
(1)
or
8
(a)
(3)
and
he
has
to
have
one
or
the
other
and
then
it
is
that
comes
in
the
accommodation
between
employer
and
employees
just
with
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
predicated
upon
an
8
(a)
(1)
or
8
(a)
(3)
findings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
has
to
be
one
or
the
other.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
have
to
find
that
before
--
