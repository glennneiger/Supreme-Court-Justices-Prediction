the
only
question
you
present
in
the
petition
is
imprisonment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you
say
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
taking
the
board
findings
more
than
an
assumption
is
taking
the
board
findings.
justice
john
m.
harlan
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
a
good
faith
--
a
good
faith
mistaken
belief.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
reason
this
case
is
here
on
that
question
because
the
circuit
has
excluded
them.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
means
that
the
employers
got
to
wait
until
the
dynamiting
takes
place
before
they
can
fire
them.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes
but
we're
here
on
the
premise
mr.
ordman
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
if
you
don't
mind
my
repeating
that
way.
justice
john
m.
harlan
here
on
the
premise,
and
the
only
question
is
a
good
faith
belief
on
the
part
of
the
employer.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
therefore,
these
other
things
are
quite
collateral
to
this
field.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
say
that
it's
an
accommodation
that
the
board
is
within
the
reasonable
powers
of
the
court.
justice
john
m.
harlan
from
that
argument,
i
understand.
