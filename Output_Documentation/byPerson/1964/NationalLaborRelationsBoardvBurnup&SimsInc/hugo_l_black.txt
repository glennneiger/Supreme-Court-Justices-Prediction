justice

mr.
phillips,
what's
the
facts
that
effect
of
that
--
what
the
board
has
done
here
to
order
them
not
to
repeat
a
violation.
isn't
that
one
of
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
other
is
to
make
them
hold?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
as
i
understand
it,
it
boils
down
to
this
controversy
that
the
company
had
a
right
that
this
could
be
upset.
they
shouldn't
be
paid
because
the
company
had
a
belief
that
they
intended
to
dynamite
although
they
were
wrong.
i
think
it's
just
an
ordinary
contract
of
employment
employed
for
a
year
except
to
be
discharged
for
violation
of
law,
whatever
this
was,
would
that
be
a
defense
for
the
company
that
they
have
a
good
faith
belief?
that
the
--
that
they
really
had
intended
to
dynamite
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
was
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
there
was
not
but
they
were
discharged
without
--
on
the
grounds
according
to
this,
according
to
your
statement
that
was
wrong
if
they
hadn't
done
anything
and
they've
lost
their
jobs.
