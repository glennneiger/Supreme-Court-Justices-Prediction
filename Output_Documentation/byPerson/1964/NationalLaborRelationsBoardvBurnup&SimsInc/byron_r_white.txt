justice

white
for
having
said
that
mr.
ordman,
do
i
understand
that
this
case
is
submitted
to
us
on
the
premise
that
nevertheless
the
employer
had
good
faith
--
believed
that
that
was
(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
did
the
board
find
--
what
did
the
board
find?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
it
rested
its
holding
on
the
lack
of
bad
faith
--
(voice
overlap)
faith.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
trial
examiner
found
there
was
a
good
faith.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
board
itself
found
both
things
if
there
was
--
a)
there
was
not
good
faith,
a
good
faith
belief
and
even
if
--
even
if
there
was
--
there
is
still
a
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
both
things
they
have
to
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
both?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
they
also
held
that
even
if
there
was,
did
they
also
hold
that
even
if
there
was
a
good
faith
belief
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
all
--
but
they
did
find
it
on
the
facts
that
there
was
not
a
good
faith.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
of
appeals
--
do
you
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
both
of
their
claims?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
board
did
also
found
--
the
board
did
found
that
there
was
not
a
good
faith
belief
on
the
part
of
the
employer,
that
this
was
a
pretext.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
that
point
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
had
to
--
i
guess
it
gets
the
other
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
to
an
8
(a)
(1)
file?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
there
isn't
--
it
isn't.
let's
assume
that
a
good
faith
belief
is
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
enough
to
insulate
the
employer
from
what,
an
8
(a)
(1)
violation
or
an
8
(a)
(3)?
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
the
--
doesn't
the
--
doesn't
the
board
--
isn't
the
board
really
saying
that
since
we've
given
up
the
good
faith
argument,
that
the
only
thing
that
can
be
left
is
an
8
(a)
(1)?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
no,
i
realize
the
court
below
because
there
they
were
arguing
their
good
--
their
bad
faith
thing
too.
but
the
--
but
the
court
rejected
both
grounds
and
the
board
now
has
abandoned
--
has
abandoned
the
argument
that
the
employer
acted
in
bad
faith.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
does
that
mean
that
they
are
abandoning
the
argument
about
that
--
that
that
it
was
an
8
(a)
(3)?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
a
critical
fact
in
--
in
finding
the
violation
even
though
there's
good
faith
is
that
the
active
place
when
the
employee
was
engaged
in
protected
activity.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
the
board
usually
grant
the
reinstatement
of
back
pays
for
an
8
(a)
(1)
when
there's
no
8
(a)
(3)?
