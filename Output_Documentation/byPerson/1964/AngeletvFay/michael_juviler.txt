mr.
michael
juviler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
as
we
come
to
the
close
of
the
lengthy
arguments.
in
this
case
i
propose
that
we
turn
our
attention
from
the
past
to
the
future
and
address
ourselves
to
the
effects
of
this
case
on
the
future
development
of
criminal
justice.
there
is
no
question
that
the
forward
progress
of
criminal
justice
in
the
united
states
has
proceeded
with
the
state
courts
in
the
advance
guard.
the
recent
developments
of
procedures
with
respect
to
the
right
to
counsel,
the
use
of
confessions
and
search
and
seizure,
developments
that
have
been
announced
in
decisions
of
this
court
can
be
traced
to
progressive
decisions
in
our
leading
state
courts
that
foreshadow
the
results
to
come.
and
many
of
the
state
decisions
went
far
beyond
the
constitutional
requirements
proceed
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
i
suggest
that
if
the
continuing
improvement
of
criminal
justice
is
to
be
part
of
our
constitutional
development,
that
this
court
not
adopt
the
absolute
principle
of
retroactivity
proposed
by
the
instant
petitioner
under
which
all
improvements
in
criminal
justice
that
reach
the
status
of
fundamental
change
must
require
reopening
of
previously
closed
cases
and
the
development
of
the
exclusionary
rule
itself
points
up
this
argument.
the
exclusionary
rule
was
introduced
into
american
jurisprudence
by
a
state
court,
11
years
before
this
court
announced
the
weeks
rule,
subsequently,
almost
half
of
the
states
prior
to
mapp
voluntarily
adopted
exclusionary
rules
in
their
jurisdictions.
for
example
the
high
court
of
california,
people
against
cahan,
announced
a
decision
which
has
frequently
been
cited
in
decisions
of
this
court.
yet
the
california
courts
declined
to
apply
their
exclusionary
rule
retroactively
and
after
this
court's
decision
in
mapp,
every
state
court
that
has
had
occasion
to
pass
upon
this
question
has
held
that
the
mapp
decision
does
not
require
reopening
previously
closed
cases.
of
course,
there
are
recurrent
questions
under
the
fourth
amendment
aside
from
the
exclusionary
rule,
questions
that
were
alluded
to
in
this
court's
decision
in
mapp.
and
if
these
questions
are
to
be
decided
by
state
courts
and
lower
federal
courts
on
the
basis
of
appropriate
standards
of
fairness
proper
to
present
day
procedures
and
present
day
needs
of
law
enforcements,
these
troublesome
questions
cannot
be
decided
under
the
shadow
of
the
prospect
that
every
new
change
and
every
contribution
in
the
development
of
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
will
require
through
habeas
corpus
or
any
procedure,
a
reexamination
of
every
prior
conviction
that
was
entered
under
an
earlier
stage
in
this
constitutional
development.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
many
state
courts
and
lower
federal
courts
are
wrestling
under
the
fourth
amendment
with
the
problem
whether
under
certain
circumstances
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
disclosure
of
the
identity
of
an
informant
whose
communications
to
the
police
were
relied
upon
to
establish
probable
cause.
in
every
case
that
takes
a
liberal
progressive
view
of
the
right
of
a
defendant
to
disclosure
of
the
informant's
identity,
the
fourth
amendment
principles
announced
in
mapp
have
been
held
not
retroactive.
and
in
other
areas,
then
the
fourth
amendment
in
other
continuing
evolutions
of
rights
through
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
can
see
the
same
process
and
we
can
predict
the
same
restriction
on
the
free
development
of
criminal
law,
if
this
court
announces
that
every
fundamental
improvement
in
criminal
justice
must
require
a
reopening
of
all
previously
closed
cases.
for
example,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
escobedo
was
foreshadowed
by
decisions
of
a
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
its
ruling
in
people
against
donovan
is
not
retroactive.
as
to
the
escobedo
case
the
high
court
of
california
recently
extended
the
principle
of
escobedo
to
situations
in
which
the
defendant
does
not
request
counsel.
yet
the
same
court
in
in
re
lopez
has
held
that
the
principles
of
escobedo
and
dorado
are
not
retroactive
and
do
not
require
a
reexamination
of
previously
rendered
judgments
of
defendants
who
might
have
been
tried
under
a
different
principle.
and
only
this
tuesday,
the
appellate
division,
first
department
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
york
extended
the
donovan
and
escobedo
principles
to
situations
in
which
the
defendant
requests
to
see
a
member
of
his
family,
people
against
taylor
and
your
honors
will
note
in
reading
that
opinion
which
has
not
yet
published,
that
the
court
took
specific
pains
to
point
out
that
they
were
rendering
this
decision
in
a
case
that
was
still
in
the
normal
appellate
process.
mr.
michael
juviler
i'd
be
very
happy
mr.
justice.
it
should
be
clear
from
these
examples
and
others
which
are
cited
it
at
greater
length
in
our
brief
that
the
constitution
of
today
is
not
the
same
constitution
that
this
court
interpreted
in
1949,
but
if
this
court
accepts
the
view
that
the
constitution
is
the
same
today
as
in
1949,
and
that
any
fundamental
addition
to
interpretations
of
that
constitution
require
a
reexamination
of
all
past
cases,
then
we
may
well
reach
a
stage
of
development
in
which
the
constitution
will
remain
the
same.
it
is
too
much
to
expect
of
these
state
courts
which
have
accepted
the
invitation
of
this
court
and
the
encouragement
of
this
court
to
extend
the
rights
of
defendants
that
this
procedure
will
continue
if
the
drastic
remedy
of
retroactivity
is
entailed
in
every
one
of
these
new
developments.
and
in
the
interest
of
encouraging
the
state
courts
to
continue
to
expand
the
benefits
available
to
present
day
defendants
beyond
those
available
to
past
defendants
we
urge
the
court
to
reject
the
principle
of
absolute
retroactivity
that
is
entailed
in
petitioner's
arguments.
i
wish
to
point
out
that
these
implications
of
the
issues
in
this
case
are
not
limited
to
judgments
rendered
in
the
state
courts
and
are
not
limited
to
the
continuing
development
of
constitutional
principles
in
the
state
courts.
if
we
accept
the
notion
that
every
constitutional
interpretation
whether
it
be
under
the
fourth
amendments
or
any
other
of
the
amendments
in
the
bill
of
rights
require
reexamination
of
previously
closed
cases
on
the
premise
that
this
is
the
same
constitution
that
was
before
the
court
in
1949
or
1953,
then
the
federal
judgments
will
be
subject
to
reexamination
and
we
trust
that
the
lower
federal
courts
which
are
contributing
to
the
content
of
due
process
will
be
equally
inhibited.
i
note
that
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
recently
overruled
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
on
the
question
of
the
right
to
disclosure
of
the
informant's
identity
on
the
question
of
probably
cause.
but
again
this
decision
was
rendered
in
a
jurisdiction
which
under
the
angelet
case
did
not
require
reexamination
of
previously
closed
cases,
whether
they
be
federal
or
state
convictions.
if
we
could
expect
that
the
constitution
of
today
would
and
should
be
the
same
as
the
constitution
of
ten
years
hence,
then
there
would
be
no
problem,
in
this
case.
the
problem
of
retroactivity
itself
can
arise
only
in
a
constitutional
system
which
invites
change.
so
that
we
--
when
we
examine
the
challenging
question
in
this
case
as
to
how
we
can
continue
to
detain
persons
whose
convictions
might
have
been
unconstitutional,
we
must
turn
to
the
language
of
the
majority
in
the
court
below.
the
word
constitutional
is
not
a
talisman
that
carries
magic
results.
we
urge
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
in
large
measure
to
apply
an
absolute
principle
of
retroactivity,
because
the
constitution
invites
change
this
court
has
continuously
encouraged
change
--
mr.
michael
juviler
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
michael
juviler
the
constitution
invites
this
court
--
mr.
michael
juviler
to
--
mr.
michael
juviler
we
are
not
urging
that
this
court
change
the
constitution
from
day
to
day,
but
to
recognize
changes
that
have
been
worked
out
in
the
state
courts,
bringing
new
meaning
to
our
concepts
of
due
process.
if
this
court
were
to
decide
question
of
due
process
without
any
help
from
the
state
courts
or
the
lower
federal
courts,
then
the
due
process
clause
would
be
a
wasteland,
which
had
no
content
and
we
urge
the
court
to
continue
to
strengthen
the
content
of
the
constitution
and
to
reject
petitioner's
suggestion
that
every
decision
based
on
the
constitution
must
be
available
to
prior
defendants
regardless
of
the
date
of
their
convictions.
another
implication
aside
from
the
content
of
specific
rights
in
the
bill
of
rights
of
a
holding
of
retroactivity
would
be
an
obliteration
of
the
boundaries
between
a
judgment
rendered
and
carried
through
the
normal
appellate
process
and
the
extraordinary
remedy
of
collateral
attack
whether
that
collateral
attack
be
in
the
federal
courts
or
in
the
state
courts.
if
every
judgment
and
every
trial
must
be
constantly
reexamined
on
the
basis
of
all
of
the
constitutional
decisions
that
are
in
the
books
at
the
moment,
then
there
is
never
going
to
be
a
judgment
on
which
any
member
of
society,
whether
it
be
defendant
or
the
community
can
rely.
we
would
have
just
a
constant
reexamination
of
every
judgment
based
on
every
new
decision
that
had
any
suggestion
of
a
fundamental
decision
interpreting
the
constitution.
mr.
michael
juviler
no,
i
don't
believe
we
could.
the
griffin
case
involves
a
limited
number
of
cases
in
which
prior
defendants
were
denied
their
right
to
appeal,
the
griffin
raises
no
implication
--
mr.
michael
juviler
your
honor
we
will
note
that
absent
from
any
of
our
arguments
--
mr.
michael
juviler
your
honor
will
note
that
there
is
no
suggestion
of
jail
delivery
in
any
of
the
arguments
on
behalf
of
respondent,
but
when
i
said
refer
to
the
limited
number
i
meant
there
is
a
certain
number
of
prior
cases
in
which
judgments
were
rendered
before
griffin
and
defendants
were
denied
their
rights
to
appeal.
now
it
maybe
burdensome
for
court
systems
in
the
states
or
the
federal
jurisdiction
to
restore
these
rights
to
appeal
to
those
defendants,
but
once
this
task
has
been
accomplished,
the
griffin
case
will
involve
no
future
open
questions
as
to
what
is
an
appeal
or
what
is
indigence
but
the
fourth
amendment,
the
subject
of
the
mapp
decision
has
tremendous
recurring
questions,
which
are
listed
at
length
in
our
brief,
which
have
no
relationship
to
the
limited
question
in
griffin
whether
a
particular
defendant
was
denied
the
right
to
appeal
because
of
indigence.
mr.
michael
juviler
the
gideon
case
has
more
questions
that
will
be
recurring,
particularly
questions
as
to
the
competency
of
counsel
i
would
expect,
but
even
here
there
is
no
comparison
in
the
complexity
of
the
questions
to
be
decided
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
those
to
be
decided
as
to
the
competency
of
counsel.
moreover
as
professor
thoron
has
pointed
out,
there
are
overriding
reasons
for
applying
the
gideon
decision
to
previously
closed
cases
and
we
maintain
that
those
reasons
are
absent
from
the
present
case.
thank
you.
