mr.
leon
b.
polsky
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
george
angelet
brings
his
case
to
the
federal
court
not
under
mapp
against
ohio.
his
claim
is
under
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
constitution
and
under
section
2241
of
the
judicial
code.
his
claim
in
the
language
of
the
statute
that
he
is
now
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
the
state
asks
that
in
determining
whether
george
angelet
is
now
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
we
have
two
phases
of
our
case.
our
attack
is
first
upon
the
present
custody.
our
attack
is
also
upon
the
conviction.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
i
would
suspect
that
the
conviction
would
then
be
vacated
and
he
would
then
be
retried
by
order
of
the
state
court.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
historically,
in
all
the
cases
that
i
have
seen
where
writs
of
habeas
corpus
have
been
sustained,
the
practice
has
been
to
issue
a
conditional
writ
discharging
the
prisoner
from
custody
unless
he
is
retried
within
a
reasonable
time.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
because
in
order
to
release
him
from
the
present
detention,
you
must
destroy
the
order
which
is
the
basis
of
holding
the
man
in
custody.
you
must
vacate
the
sentence
part
of
the
judgment
under
which
the
defendant
is
being
held.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no,
i
still
stick
to
this
sir.
i
think
there
can
be
a
distinction
made
between
the
present
detention,
because
the
statute
makes
that
distinction.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes,
oh!
at
some
there
will,
in
order
to
retry
the
man,
well
though
to
be
quite
honest,
in
the
several
cases
where
--
that
i
have
seen,
where
writs
have
been
sustained
by
federal
courts
and
a
retrial
order,
a
conditional
retrial
order
has
been
made,
there
has
never
been
any
formal
action
taken
in
the
state
court
to
vacate
the
initial
conviction
of,
all
that
happened
is,
he
was
brought
back
in
and
they
picked
up
where
they
left
off
and
started
all
over
again.
i
think,
if
we
get
involved
in
the
mechanics
of
the
way
a
state
court
handles
its
own
judgments,
i
don't
think
you
can
let
that
control
your
approach
to
your
power
under
the
statute
and
your
disposition
of
this
case,
but
here
angelet
says,
that
i
am
brining
this
case
to
the
district
court
and
i
am
presenting
the
district
court
with
a
certain
set
of
facts.
and
i
ask
you
to
decide,
either
that
my
present
detention
or
my
past
conviction
violated
the
constitution.
the
state
in
response
to
this
says
to
the
district
judge
or
to
whichever
appellate
court
it
goes
to,
passing
from
the
question,
in
weighing
the
facts
of
this
case
and
disposing
of
this
case,
we
don't
ask
you
to
do
what
courts
have
always
done,
mainly
look
at
it
and
decide
it,
we
ask
you
to
look
at
it
and
then
say,
well
i
am
going
to
apply
a
particular
law
to
this
case,
a
law
that
is
14
years
old,
is
18
years
old,
is
six
years
old,
courts
when
they
decide
cases,
decide
cases
on
the
law
as
it
is
at
the
time
they
decide
their
case.
we
ask
that
the
validity
of
this
conviction
or
the
validity
of
the
present
detention
be
judged
on
the
basis
of
the
law
as
it
is
when
you
decide
this
case.
if
at
that
time,
you
come
to
render
your
decision
in
this
case,
you
decide
that
mapp
against
ohio
should
be
overruled,
then
george
angelet
should
not
get
out
of
prison,
because
at
the
time
of
the
decision
of
this
case
that
would
not
be
the
law.
this
man's
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
would
not
be
violated
on
the
basis
of
the
law
as
you
see
it
at
the
time
you
render
your
decision.
now
in
our
brief,
we
have
the
taken
the
unpopular
course
of
defending
mr.
justice
blackstone
and
mr.
justice
holmes.
we
do
it
because
we
think
that
although
the
rule
has
been
criticized
and
a
large
extent,
soundly
criticized,
the
criticism
is
based
upon
a
misconception
of
what
the
rule
of
retrospectivity
is.
the
rule
of
retrospectivity
contains
within
it,
all
of
the
palliatives,
which
would
prevent
the
harsh
results
that
jurists
like
justice
cardozo
foresaw
in
unlimited
retrospectivity.
for
example,
res
judicata
is
a
defense
in
a
case
where
a
plaintiff
sues
claiming
upon
new
law,
which
overruled
a
case
which
previously
disposed
in
his
case.
in
a
typical
civil
case,
a
suit
is
brought,
judgment
is
rendered.
if
subsequently
the
law
changes
and
the
plaintiff
now
sees
that
he
might
win
under
the
present
state
of
the
law
and
he
brings
suit,
the
defendant
comes
in
and
does
not
say
that
the
law
is
today
what
it
was
three
years
ago
when
you
lost
your
suit,
but
he
says
res
judicata
and
the
court
never
gets
to
decide
the
question
of
whether
we
should
apply
today's
law
or
yesterday's
law.
there
is
a
principle
which
prevents
the
court
ever
reaching
the
question
of
what
law
it
is
to
be
applied.
similarly,
the
doctrine
of
legitimate
reliance
or
justifiable
reliance,
which
was
the
prime
motivation
for
justice
cardozo's
challenge
to
the
concept
of
retrospectivity,
is
also
applicable.
this
is
an
equitable
defense
in
many
cases,
in
most
cases.
if
the
state
in
this
case,
legitimately
relied
upon
wolf
against
colorado,
and
if
the
state
in
this
case
can
show
that
it
has
been
injured
by
its
reliance,
legitimate
reliance,
upon
wolf
against
colorado
perhaps
that
would
be
an
equitable
defense.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
i
say
they
can't
your
honor,
but
their
position
is
that
they
have.
their
position
is
that
they
have
legitimately
relied
upon
wolf,
while
they
say
in
their
brief
they
do
not
condone
the
conduct
of
the
police
officers
who
broke
into
this
man's
home
and
ransacked
it
for
an
hour-and-a-half,
while
they
do
not
condone
that,
they
say
that
the
prosecutor
and
the
trial
court
and
the
whole
judicial
set
up
of
the
state
of
new
york
had
no
part
in
this.
they
washed
their
hands
of
the
conduct
of
the
police
officers
and
they
say
therefore,
we
are
not
the
ones
who
violated
the
law.
we
didn't
do
anything
other
than
what
this
court
told
us
we
could
do.
i
submit
that
is
not
so,
that
it
is
not
reliance
nor
is
it
justified
reliance.
the
state
in
this
case
offered
this
evidence,
we
contend
knowing
that
it
was
obtained
in
violation
of
what
this
court
said
in
wolf
that
the
fourth
amendment
applies
to
state
officers
through
the
fourteenth
and
wolf
--
this
was
spelled
out.
wolf
did
not
say
the
fourth
amendment
either
alone
or
through
the
fourteenth
does
not
apply
to
the
states.
in
wolf,
this
court
said
it
does,
but
there
is
nothing
that
we
see
that
we
now
can
do
about
it.
the
state
relied
upon
the
hope
that
this
court
would
never
do
anything
about
it,
but
the
state
does
not
--
i
cannot
see
how
the
state
can
say
that
they
acted
honorably
in
using
this
evidence,
that
they
acted
with
justification
and
that
they
did
not
know
that
they
were
violating
this
man's
rights
and
condoning
the
violation
by
the
police
officers.
this
is
the
same
situation
as
in
the
coerced
confession
cases
or
the
jury
exclusion
cases
where
state
after
state
has
come
in
and
said,
putting
in
this
confession,
it
was
the
police
officer
who
beat
the
prisoner
not
the
district
attorney
and
not
the
trial
court
judge
or
in
excluding
persons
from
the
array
in
a
jury,
it
was
not
the
court
that
did
it
or
the
district
attorney
who
did
it,
but
it
was
some
lowly
clerk
who
did
it
on
his
own.
the
state
can't
walk
away
from
the
way
it
obtained
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no
sir,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
this
court
squarely
said
in
wolf
that
this
is
wrong.
this
court
told
the
states
in
wolf,
clean
your
own
houses,
we
will
give
you
time
to
do
it,
but
do
it.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes,
sir.
and
the
question
is
to
what
extent
the
exclusionary
rule
fell
within
that
court,
but
the
search
here,
the
seizure
here
i
think
under
wolf,
under
pre-wolf
did
violate
this
man's
basic
rights.
and
it's
that
violation
which
has
set
off
a
chain
reaction.
it
is
the
violation
of
his
rights,
which
took
place
in
his
home,
the
same
as
the
violation
of
a
prisoner's
rights,
which
take
place
in
the
back
room
of
a
police
station,
which
set
off
the
chain
that
eventually
attacked
the
judgment
itself
and
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes,
sir.
i
raise
that,
the
problem
is
we
do
have
a
bit
of
a
fuzzy
record
on
it.
it
is
clear
that
the
federal
agents
had
discussed
with
the
state
offices,
the
conduct
of
this
defendant
prior
to
the
time
of
the
search.
i
think
the
testimony
of
the
federal
agent
is,
he
has
discussed
with
the
defendant
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
fitzgerald,
on
page
94,
he
says
i
discussed
the
defendant
many
times
with
the
detective.
and
he
said
--
he
observed
him
before
the
arrest.
and
then
he
also
said
that
he
thought
that
angelet
was
violating
the
federal
smuggling
law.
now
this
i
think
is
a
situation
--
reverse.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
i
think
so.
i
realize
i
have
to
stretch
for
that.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
oh!
it
could
have
been
enjoined.
now
the
question
then
is,
is
that
injunctive
relief,
the
only
relief
which
they
would
have
got.
we
say
particularly
since
we
emphasize
that
mapp
is
a
remedial
decision,
that
why
is
one
remedy
the
exclusive
remedy
and
in
a
real
situation,
this
court
said
that
there
is
this
remedy,
now
we
have
mapp,
we
have
another
remedy.
and
we
claim
that
for
this
violation
of
right,
the
remedy
which
mapp
allows
may
be
exercised.
i
brought
this
distinction,
which
i
grant
is
not
fully
accepted
that
mapp
really
is
a
decision,
which
deals
with
remedies
not
with
rights,
that
the
right,
which
is
involved
has
been
and
has
been
recognized
as
the
right.
and
all
that
mapp
does
is
say
well,
for
the
violation
of
this
right,
we
will
provide
a
particular
remedy,
because
the
remedy
that
we
gave
in
the
past
has
proved
ineffective.
this
does
not
to
me
create
a
new
right,
although
there
has
been
dispute
over
this.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
the
new
york
courts
have
held
forgetting
the
first
flush
of
cases
where
no
one
really
knew
what
we
were
doing.
the
new
york
courts
have
held
that
if
objection
was
taken
in
a
pre-mapp
trial
and
the
case
was
pending
on
appeal
at
the
time
of
mapp
decision,
on
the
basis
of
the
objection.
then
either
the
appellate
division
or
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
could
reverse.
if
there
were
no
objection,
then
the
appellate
division
in
the
exercise
of
its
statutory
power
could
reverse
in
the
interests
of
justice,
but
if
the
case
had
passed
the
appellate
division
or
if
the
appellate
division
refused
to
reverse
in
the
interests
of
justice,
then
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
because
of
a
--
what
they
feel,
what
the
court
feels
to
be
a
jurisdictional
limitation
will
not
pass
upon
on
any
search
and
seizure
claim.
in
other
words,
if
there
is
no
objection,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
regardless
of
what
point
whether
it's
pre-mapp,
post-mapp
will
not
pass
upon
on
search
and
seizure
claim.if
there
is
an
objection
and
if
there
is
not
the
appellate
division
made,
but
need
not.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
there
has
been
talk
about
the
impact
of
retrospectivity
and
the
district
attorney
has
conjured
up
a
parade
of
horrors
of
what
will
happen
when
the
landslide,
which
he
expects
comes
to
the
district
court.
i
have
compiled
statistics;
the
district
attorney
has
compiled
statistics.
in
all
candor,
i
cannot
say
that
my
statistics
are
reliable.
i
have
no
idea
of
what
the
impact
of
retrospectivity
would
be.
perhaps,
statistics
was
the
wrong
word,
in
my
brief,
i
mentioned
that,
to
our
knowledge,
there
are
no
more
than
a
dozen
cases.
now
i
will
say
this
however
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no,
there
are
no
more
--
actually
in
the
brief
i
refereed
to
a
dozen
cases
nationwide,
where
in
my
judgment
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
has
been
adjudicated
to
have
taken
place
prior
to
mapp.
now
i
can
see
that's
unreliable,
but
i
don't
think
we
ever
will
get
reliable
statistics
until
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
just
going
through
the
reported
cases
that
i
was
able
to
find
at
that
time
i
did
it.
there
have
probably
been
some
more
since
then,
but
i
will
say
this
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
i
will
suggest
this
though.
my
office
represents
approximately
one
half
of
the
criminal
defendants
in
the
city
of
new
york
by
assignment.
i
have
found
only
three
cases,
which
to
me
spell
out
a
clear
illegal
search
and
seizure.
there
is
no
question
that
they
are
going
to
be
claims
made.
there
is
no
question
that
unless
you
wish
to
take
away
the
pens
of
the
prisoners,
there
are
going
to
be
many
writs
filed.
whether
the
number
is
2,000
or
5,000
i
do
not
know,
but
i
suggest
that
it
is
the
job
of
justice
to
take
care
of
those
cases
whatever
the
number
maybe.
it
is
the
job
of
the
district
attorneys
and
it
is
the
job
of
the
district
judges
and
as
a
defender
organization,
it
is
the
job
of
my
organization
to
take
those
cases
and
if
this
court
directs
that
it
be
done,
it
will
be
done.
the
number
of
cases
which
the
district
attorney
suggests
will
increase
on
the
habeas
corpus
calendars
of
the
federal
district
judges.
there
is
no
greater
than
the
number
of
cases
on
this
court's
miscellaneous
calendar
and
the
number
of
district
judges
is
many
times
greater
than
the
number
of
justices
in
this
court.
if
you
took
4,000
habeas
corpus
cases
and
spread
them
among
the
district
judges
and
i
grant
that
many,
in
many
cases
the
petitions
are
concentrated
in
particular
districts.
but
you
spread
them
among
all
of
the
district
judges,
those
4,000
cases
are
no
more
than
a
dozen
extra
petitions
for
each
judge.
but
i
grant
that
it
will
be
worked,
but
it
is
no
excuse
for
not
trying
and
if
there
has
been
a
violation
of
this
petitioner's
rights
and
of
any
other
petitioner
similarly
situated,
he
is
entitled
to
the
relief
from
this
court
or
from
a
federal
district
court.
i
would
respectfully
urge
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed
and
the
case
be
remanded
with
directions
to
sustain
the
writ.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
sustain
the
writ
unless
the
petitioner
is
retried
within
a
reasonable
time.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
mr.
chief
justice,
i
am
concerned
by
the
argument
that
mr.
juviler
has
made
that
our
claim
that
mapp
would
be
applicable
or
that
mr.
angelet
should
be
released
under
this
decision
would
have
an
inhibiting
factor,
it
would
be
an
inhibiting
factor
on
the
growth
and
development
of
both
the
constitutional
law
generally
and
the
law
of
search
and
seizure
specifically.
i
don't
think
that
either
that
is
a
problem
in
this
case
or
that,
that
really
is
a
problem
in
another
case.
if
at
some
time
in
the
future
the
court
would
dispose
to
overrule
or
change
one
of
its
decisions
or
criteria
for
what
is
or
is
not
an
illegal
or
legal
search.
prisoners
previously
convicted
under
the
old
decision
very
well
might
bring
their
petitions
claiming
under
2255
or
habeas
corpus,
claiming
relief,
but
they
would
be
met
at
the
threshold
by
the
government's
reply
that
they
had
legitimately
relied
upon
what
had
been
the
decision
of
this
court.
that
is
what
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
hypothetical
cases
which
the
respondents
have
put
forward.
what
distinguishes
this
case
is
that
there
was
an
unconscionable
wrong
done
and
it
was
known
to
be
just
that
at
the
time
it
was
done,
a
mistake
cannot
now
go
back
upon
that.
in
answer
to,
i
think
the
first
question
of
mr.
justice
stewart,
illegally
seized
evidence
is
reliable
evidence,
it
is
devastatingly
reliable
evidence,
but
because
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
particularly
as
in
this
case
which
is
a
possession
case
really
the
whole
case
is
the
proof
that
the
material
had
been
seized,
that
the
defendant
was
possessed
of
it.
so
not
only
is
it
reliable,
but
in
this
case
it
is
the
proof
of
guilt.
but
is
that
the
criteria
for
determining
a
man's
right
to
relief
in
federal
court,
true,
men
without
counsel
if
innocent
might
be
convicted
erroneously.
men
who
have
been
beaten
might
confess
falsely,
but
men
have
been
beaten
and
given
true
confessions.
guilty
men
have
been
convicted
without
counsel
and
yet
we
apply
the
right
uniformly
because
it
is
the
right
which
is
the
important
thing
and
it
is
that
right
which
we
ask
this
court
to
vindicate,
thanks.
