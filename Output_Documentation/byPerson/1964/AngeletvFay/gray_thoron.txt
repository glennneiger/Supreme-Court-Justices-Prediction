mr.
gray
thoron
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
angelet
is
today
in
confinement
pursuant
to
a
pre-mapp
narcotics
conviction,
which
took
place
in
1951.
a
trial
in
that
year,
that
every
test
of
constitutional
fairness
on
the
basis
of
law
of
it
was
for
then
or
authoritatively
interpreted
by
this
court.
now
broadly
stated,
the
question
here
and
the
questions
from
the
bench
indicated
that
is
not
an
easy
question.
if
it
is
to
what
extent
does
a
change
in
law
and
changes
of
course
are
inevitable.
a
change
resulting
from
judicial
reinterpretation
justify
the
reopening
of
prior
cases.
cases
which
have
been
fully
tried
without
error
on
the
basis
of
law
as
it
was
then
authoritatively
formulated
by
this
court.
now,
there
is
no
one
easy
answer
to
this
question.
we
recognize
that
there
are
a
number
of
situations
where
reopening
closed
cases
as
a
result
of
evolutionary
interpretation
or
reinterpretation
of
law
is
not
only
appropriate,
but
may
even
be
essential
if
justice
is
to
be
done.
our
position
is
not
that
there
are
no
proper
cases
for
retroactivity.
at
the
same
time,
we
must
recognize
that
there
are
categories
of
closed
cases,
where
re-opening
on
federal
habeas
corpus
is
inappropriate
and
we
believe
destructive
of
sound
judicial
administration.
it
is
our
position
that
the
case
at
bar
falls
into
this
category.
i
think
we
have
to
begin
our
analysis,
by
drawing
the
distinction,
which
has
been
drawn
consistently
in
lower
courts
or
state
and
federal.
the
distinction
between
review
on
direct
appeal
and
review
on
collateral
attack,
on
post
conviction
remedy
of
decisions
which
are
no
longer
reviewable
on
appeal.
the
extraordinary
post
conviction
writs,
especially
habeas
corpus
serve
a
very
vital
function
in
appropriate
cases,
but
they
cannot
be
chaotically
substituted
for
an
orderly
system
of
normal
judicial
appeals.
now
this
distinction
has
they
said
been
frequently
recognized,
cases
still
pending
can
properly
be
given
retroactive
benefit
of
new
rule,
whether
the
new
rule
is
judicial
or
statutory.
in
a
number
of
situations
where
closed
cases
should
not
be
given
the
benefit
of
a
new
rule.
now,
it's
not
illogical
to
draw
this
distinction
because
there
are
compelling
policy
reasons,
which
say
that
it
is
essential
to
an
economical
judicial
system
to
follow
normal
procedures.
now
recognizing
this
distinction
that
we
draw
between
direct
appeal
where
we
recognize
retroactivity
as
proper,
what
amount
of
cases
where
retroactivity
is
proper
on
collateral
attack.
when
should
a
judicially
adopted
change
in
law
be
given
retroactive
effect
as
to
these
closed
cases
on
post-conviction
collateral
attacknow
i've
read
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
there
are
number
of
recent
ones
which
are
in
point
and
it
seems
to
me
that
one
big
category
of
case
that
explains
just
about
every
decision
which
has
been
retroactively
applied.
our
decisions
whenever
there
is
any
possible
doubt
as
to
the
reliability
of
the
guilt
finding
process.
if
there
is
any
possibility
of
failure
of
process,
it
involved
lack
of
counsel.
there
is
doubt
as
to
the
reliability
of
the
guilt
finding
process
when
a
man
is
tried
in
a
criminal
prosecution
without
a
lawyer.
those
cases
should
and
have
been
retroactively
applied
on
collateral
attack
and
the
second
circuit
itself
from
which
this,
to
which
this
petition
has
been
directed
allowed
retroactive
attack
in
a
gideon
type
situation
by
a
7:2
majority
and
denied
retroactivity
in
the
instant
case
by
a
similar
7:2
vote.
in
griffin,
there
was
a
less
complete
adjudication
because
the
accused
was
unable
to
afford
a
transcript,
which
again
bar
on
at
least
a
possible
doubt
as
to
the
complete
reliability
of
the
guilt
finding
process.
it
hasn't
been
completed.
in
jackson
against
denno,
the
guilt
finding
process
was
less
reliable
because
of
emotional
overtones
resulting
from
letting
a
jury
hear
a
confession
before
determining
its
voluntariness.
these
are
cases
where
there
is
a
possibility
of
safeguarding
the
innocent
and
it
seems
to
me
if
that
possibility
exists
in
the
case,
there
is
a
very
strong
reason
for
applying
it
retroactively,
the
new
rule.
it
seems
to
me
that
at
any
case
where
the
basic
purpose
of
the
rule
can
be
advanced
by
applying
it
retroactively
and
that
is
also
a
case
for
retroactive
application,
and
there
maybe
special
circumstances
such
in
the
interest
of
justice
such
as
physical
brutality
or
violence,
but
none
of
those
reasons
as
we
have
analyzed
the
case
before
i
see
here
appear
to
be
present.
mr.
gray
thoron
that
is
correct.
but
there
are
situations
such
as
gideon
or
griffin,
in
fact
this
court
has
held
specifically
in
the
eskridge
case
that
griffin
was
a
retroactive.
mr.
gray
thoron
i
don't
know
how
much
help
we're
going
to
get
out
of
the
jurisprudential
analysis
and
not
that
my
--
mr.
gray
thoron
well,
i
suppose,
i
have
to
be
classified
with
the
legal
realists
that
law
does
change
and
law
should
change
and
it
will
continue
to
change.
mr.
gray
thoron
in
this
case
--
mr.
gray
thoron
i
have
a
hard
time
following
that
argument.
mr.
gray
thoron
i'm
not
quite
sure
that
i
understand
your
honor's
question
on
that
point.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
law
prior
to
mapp
was
that
it
was
not
reversible
error,
there
was
no
recognized
constitutional
privilege
to
exclude
illegally
seized
evidence
and
i
would
have
said
that
--
mr.
gray
thoron
i
would
say
that
it
was
the
law,
that
when
bates
and
grady
(ph)
was
--
had
been
oddly
handed
down
by
the
rule
that
the
law
was
according
to
the
then
conception
as
announced
by
this
court,
that
a
counsel
in
that
kind
of
case,
a
felony
case
was
not
required.
on
the
other
hand,
when
further
consideration
of
the
problem
convinces
the
court
that
it's
wrong
and
that
decision
relates
in
someway
to
the
possible
unreliability
of
the
guilt
finding
process
then
i
say
it
is
only
proper
and
it
is
only
just
to
apply
it
retroactively,
this
is
where
i
draw
the
distinction.
now
--
mr.
gray
thoron
i
didn't
mean
to
put
it
aside,
it
was
my
understanding
that
the
law
on
the
bates
and
grady
(ph)
and
many
cases
were
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
that
law
as
i
understand
it.
that
a
trial
was
considered
fair
and
the
law
was
that
a
lawyer
needn't
be
present
for
a
conviction
to
meet
constitutional
standards,
then
it
changed
with
gideon.
so
i
think
that
puts
me
in
the
cardozo
camp
and
not
in
the
camp
of
the
mr.
justice
black
though.
now
one
of
my
points
for
indicating
why
there
should
be
no
retroactivity,
no
retroactive
effect
here
and
it
seems
to
me
that
those
points
have
already
been
mentioned,
at
least
some
of
them.
if
we
are
to
accept
as
i
do
that
the
purpose
of
the
rule
is
not
served
by
any
retroactive
application
here,
this
was
a
point
of
view
adopted
by
the
lower
courts
that
--
mr.
gray
thoron
this
is
a
pre-mapp
seizure.
mr.
gray
thoron
pre-mapp,
1951.
pre-mapp
seizure,
1951
prosecution.
so
this
record
meets
the
issue
of
retroactivity
head
on
it
seems
to
me.
the
purpose
of
the
rule
as
i
understand
it,
and
i
think
that
it
is
the
basic
purpose
is
to
prevent
lawless
law
enforcement.
it
was
suggested
there
were
other
possible
ways
of
preventing
lawless
law
enforcement.
they
didn't
work.
california,
which
had
adopted
the
wolf
type
rule
found
it
didn't
work,
a
leading
opinion
by
mr.
justice
craner
(ph)
adopted
the
federal
rule,
not
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
right,
but
as
a
matter
of
sound
judicial
administration
for
this
very
purpose
which
was
adverted
to
in
the
court's
opinion
in
mapp.
now,
if
we
are
right
in
reading
the
opinion
that
this
is
the
purpose,
that
purpose
is
served
by
applying
mapp
in
all
cases
of
searches
and
seizures
after
mapp
was
handed
down.
and
it
seems
to
me
that,
that
is
essentially
sound
and
that
could
be
raised
on
habeas
corpus,
if
the
state
refuses
to
recognize
it
on
principles
of
brown
against
allen.
but
to
go
back
is
any
purpose
served
by
applying
the
rule
in
cases
such
as
this
one
where
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
reliability
of
the
guilt
finding
process.
now
there
is
another
point
which
is
going
to
be
developed
by
mr.
juviler,
with
respect
to
the
possible
inhibiting
affect
on
the
developing
of
development
of
evolving
standards
of
judicial
administration,
it's
easier
to
develop
new
standards.
if
they
--
if
you
don't
have
to
reopen
old
cases
every
time,
now
i
hope
i've
suggested,
i'm
going
to
bring
my
argument
to
a
conclusion
in
view
of
the
construction
of
attorney
general
lefkowitz
have
this
further
presentation,
the
court
it
seems
to
me
has
in
recent
years
made
very
great
contributions
towards
developing
fair
standards
of
criminal
trial
practice,
both
state
and
federal.
and
towards
eliminating
lawless
law
enforcement,
which
is
one
of
the
--
well
it's
a
sad
blot
on
our
history,
the
lawless
law
enforcement
we've
had
in
some
of
these
cases.
now,
if
this
were
a
case
where
enforcement
retroactive
application
of
the
new
mapp
rule,
would
in
some
significant
way
contribute
to
the
improvement
of
standards
or
to
improving
the
reliability
of
the
guilt
finding
process.
i
could
not
expect
affirmance
on
the
record
here.
but
this
is
not
the
case.
for
these
reasons
we
submit
that
the
decision
below
is
correct
and
it
should
be
affirmed.
