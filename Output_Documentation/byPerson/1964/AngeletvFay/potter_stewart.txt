justice
potter
stewart
and
may
i
just
ask,
if
that
could
be
your
basis
of
your
argument
of
the
court,
does
this
mean
that
you
are
not
attacking
the
validity
of
the
conviction,
the
initial
conviction?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
suppose,
you
would
prevail
on
the
first
one,
this
would
still
lead
to
conviction
standing
order?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
follow
that,
if
you
are
not
attacking
the
conviction,
but
only
the
illegality
of
the
present
detention
then
why
would
that
not
mean
simply
that
he
would
be
released
from
the
present
detention,
but
a
conviction
stands.
justice
potter
stewart
yes
but
mr.
polsky,
i
suggest
that
in
all
of
those
cases,
if
it's
been
on
the
ground
that
the
--
the
attack
has
been
on
the
initial
conviction,
but
your
opening
sentence
was
and
you
just
said,
you
have
got
alternative
arguments
here.
one
argument
is
premised
on
the
illegality,
the
present
detention
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
your
second
argument
is
on
the
illegality
of
the
initial
conviction.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
don't
understand
if
you
prevail
on
the
first
argument,
how
that
would
result
in
vacating
the
conviction,
why
would
it
not
result
in
nothing
more
than
his
release
from
the
present
detention?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
i
suggest
then,
we
are
only
making
one
argument,
not
making
two.
justice
potter
stewart
is
your
point,
i
suppose
that
this
is
the
equivalent
as
though
this
man
were
in
jail
without
any
trial
at
all.
and
just
as,
because
you
say
he
is
unconstitutionally
there,
certainly
if
a
person
were
picked
up
and
arrested
and
put
in
jail
for
a
term
of
years
without
any
trial
at
all,
that
would
be
quite
obviously
unconstitutional.
you
are
saying
therefore,
he
is
entitled
to
his
release
and
then,
it's
up
to
the
state
whether
or
not
they
want
to
try
him
fairly
and
squarely
in
accordance
of
the
constitution,
is
that
right.
justice
potter
stewart
how
can
a
state
be
able
to
do
that?
justice
potter
stewart
the
same
evidence
that
has
been
seized
legally
or
illegally
isn't
it,
and
it's
just
reliable
as
it
is
or
is
unreliable.
