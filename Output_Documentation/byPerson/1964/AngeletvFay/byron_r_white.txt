yes,
but
if
you
have
to
reach
the
trial
order,
you
have
to
reach
the
conviction
and
the
order
resulting
from
it.
it
really
boils
down
to
one
argument,
so
at
some
point,
you
are
going
to
have
to
get
to
upsetting
that
conviction?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
whole
state
of
new
york?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
you
suggested
in
some
cases
that
the
rule
ought
to
be
made
retroactive.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
do
you
say
in
those
cases
that
the
law
--
what
about
this
your
projection
argument,
do
you
say
that
the
law
was
or
wasn't
changed
or
what
do
you
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
cannot
get
any
help
about
it,
but
what
do
you
say
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
this
case
it
didn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
far
as
retroactive
it
didn't
change
because
it
never
was
that
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
ever
think
it
is
retroactive,
if
all
of
the
law
didn't
change.
justice
byron
r.
white
take
gideon
or
griffin.
if
you
say
you
apply
that
retroactively
and
although
the
law
at
that
time
was
that
it
was
not
a
fair
--
that
it
was
a
fair
trial,
to
have
a
trial
without
an
attorney.
now
you
are
going
to
say
that
--
go
back
and
say
well
that
really
wasn't
the
law
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
you
draw
the
distinction,
but
you
just
put
aside
the
argument
about
what
the
law
was
--
i
mean
--
although
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
the
seizure
being
before
the
mapp
or
after
the
mapp?
