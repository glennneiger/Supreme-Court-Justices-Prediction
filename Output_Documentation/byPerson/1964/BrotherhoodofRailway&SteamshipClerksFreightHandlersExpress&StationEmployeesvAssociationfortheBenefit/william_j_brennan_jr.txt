justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
solicitor
general.
do
i
correctly
understand
that
this
which
we
have
now
circled,
you
say
it
serves
the
same
office
as
a
no
union
box
on
the
ballot?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
what
--
and
i
don't
follow.
if
it
does,
why
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my
point
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
you're
going
to
go
that
far,
why
not
go
all
the
way
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
recall
it
too,
peculiarly
with
this
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
a
product
of
collective
bargaining
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
between
railroads.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
speaking
for
my
--
only
for
myself.
i
don't
--
i'm
not
much
impressed
by
it
at
first.
it's
more
bureaucratic
than
anything
else
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
you
didn't,
but
i
say
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
that's
wrapped
up
in
your
second
or
third
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
just
stroke
me
as
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
in
any
event,
they're
relative
in

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

the
board
has
rejected
--
have
there
been
instances
where
the
board
has
rejected
employees'
definitions
of
craft
or
class?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
in
your
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
is
it
you're
referring
to
this
language
of

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

that,
[inaudible]
is
in
the
opinion
of
justice
--
judge
white
right
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

not
voting
is
the
same
as
voting
no.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
in
the

[inaudible]
open

shut
on
the

of
this
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

do
you
think
[inaudible]
open
and
shut
on
the
face
of
this
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
certainly
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
[inaudible]
that
has
to
be

justice
william
j.
brennan,

that
you
have
to
go
that
far,
i'm
not
so
sure.
