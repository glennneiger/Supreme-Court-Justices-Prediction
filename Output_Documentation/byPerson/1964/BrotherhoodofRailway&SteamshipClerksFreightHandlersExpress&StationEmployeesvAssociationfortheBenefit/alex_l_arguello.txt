mr.
alex
l.
arguello
mr.
chief
justice,
gentlemen
of
the
court.
if
the
court
please,
i
represent
the
association
here
referred
to
as
abne.
we
feel
that
the
basic
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
national
labor
relations
or
the
national
railway
labor
act
provides
the
employees
with
a
fair
and
unequivocal
right
to
determine
their
representatives.
we
argue
that
it
does.
to
protect
that
right,
we,
the
association,
brought
an
action
in
the
district
court
for
injunction
which
we
were
granted
and
we
attacked
the
ballot
form
successfully
as
it
developed.
we
don't
apologize
for
the
amount
of
time
that
we
caused
to
go
by
here
on
this
election
because
it
took
us
two
years
to
get
the
national
mediation
board
to
state
that
the
ballot
that
they
had
been
using
up
to
that
time
was
unfair.
they
have
made
a
change.
they
made
the
change
shortly
before
they
came
into
this
court,
it
is
true
but
they
added
something.
the
government
has
stated
that
the
employees
here
have
a
right
to
represent
to
indicate
their
preference
for
no
representation,
in
other
words,
to
state
that
they
would
prefer
to
bargain
individually
with
their
employee
--
employer.
now,
the
way
they
say
that
we
have
that
right
is
by
refraining
to
pre-framing
--
reframing
--
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
refraining
from
voting.
in
protecting
that
right,
they
have
consistently
over
a
period
of
time
stated
in
accordance
with
the
act
that
if
less
than
a
majority
of
the
members
of
the
class
or
craft
fail
to
vote
for
representation
that
no
representative
would
be
certified.
this
is
the
conduct
of
the
board
for
many
years
last
past.
it's
a
fact
which
is
likewise
supported
here
i
believe
in
contrast
to
the
statements
of
the
solicitor
general
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
specifically
with
respect
to
the
statements
of
commissioner
eastman,
which
were
referred
to
by
the
solicitor,
which
we
have
set
forth
on
page
29
of
our
brief
in
response
to
the
direct
question
of
mr.
huddleston
as
to
the
purpose
of
this
bill.
commissioner
eastman
--
and
whether
it
was
to
coerce
organization
or
not
necessarily
imply
organization.
commissioner
eastman
said,
"no",
it
does
not
require
collective
bargaining
on
the
part
of
the
employees.
if
the
employees
do
not
wish
to
organize,
prefer
to
deal
individually
with
the
management
with
regard
to
these
matters,
why,
that
of
course
is
left
open
to
them
or
should
be.
senator
wagner
testified
to
the
same
effect
that's
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
the
house
report
at
the
time
of
the
1934
amendments
made
statements
which
are
likewise
set
forth
on
equal
strength
with
respect
to
the
right
of
the
employees
to
function
as
individual
bargaining
agents.
now,
the
government
consistently
states
that
that
right
exists.
we
think
it
arises
from
section
2
fourth
of
the
act
wherein
it
is
stated
that
a
majority
of
the
employees
in
the
class
or
craft
have
the
right
to
determine
representation.
we
feel
that
it's
the
duty
of
the
board
to
determine
the
majority
and
then
to
fairly
determine
the
will
of
the
majority.
we
feel
that
the
problem
that
arises,
the
actual
dilemma
that's
presented
by
this
case
is
the
action
of
the
board
in
stating
and
guaranteeing
to
us
a
right
under
the
act,
a
specific
privilege
under
the
act
guaranteeing
us
the
right
to
refrain
from
collective
bargaining,
and
then
stating
by
virtue
in
this
instance
of
the
ballot
or
by
virtue
in
--
in
the
solicitor's
argument
of
some
feeling
that
the
act
is
less
than
neutral
that
they
may
in
some
way
affect
or
obstruct
or
dilute
this
right.
now
here,
in
this
instance,
it's
being
done,
we
contend
by
this
ballot.
now
it's
interesting
to
note
with
respect
to
the
discussions
that
took
place
in
regard
to
the
craft
or
class
delineations,
as
they
concern
the
rights
of
the
unions
to
determine
who
and
what
a
class
or
craft
should
be
that
in
this
instance,
the
instance
before
the
court,
the
association
which
constitutes
a
large
portion
of
the
employees'
concerns,
some
6000
plus
were
never
consulted,
were
not
given
an
opportunity
to
be
heard,
and
the
only
instance
wherein
they
would
have
an
opportunity
to
express
themselves
with
respect
to
the
crafts
--
craft
or
class
would
be
at
the
very
moment
of
voting.
mr.
alex
l.
arguello
no,
it
is
not
and
it's
stated
not
to
be,
mr.
justice.
mr.
alex
l.
arguello
that
is
correct.
we
have
not
asked
the
privilege
of
being
placed
on
the
ballot.
mr.
alex
l.
arguello
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
we
made
that
clear
from
the
first
instance
of
our
litigation.
mr.
alex
l.
arguello
the
purpose
of
the
organization
was
this,
if
just
--
if
the
court
please.
there
were
a
large
number
of
employees
in
united
who
had
never
been
organized
for
any
purpose.
these
are
primarily
the
people
in
the
public
contact
divisions,
the
passenger
agents
and
so
forth.
at
this
moment,
these
two
unions
came
in
and
stated
that
they
wanted
this
class
or
craft
to
be
designated
and
they
either
one
wanted
to
be
the
representatives
of
the
class
or
craft.
at
that
moment,
it's
considerably
after
the
negotiations
had
been
going
on
between
the
unions
and
the
national
mediation
board,
a
notice
was
served
upon
the
company
that
a
--
an
election
was
proposed.
at
that
moment,
simultaneously
in
seattle
and
in
san
francisco,
groups
of
these
employees
got
together
and
looked
into
the
procedures
of
the
national
mediation
board,
found
that
they
would
not
be
affirmatively
entitled
to
vote
"no"
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
vote
that
they
desire
to
retain
their
individual
bargaining
rights
with
the
company.
it
was
at
that
moment
that
this
association
came
in
to
being
and
it
was
for
that
purpose
primarily
that
the
attack
was
made
on
these
decisions
of
the
national
mediation
board
after
we
had
petitioned
the
board
and
requested
the
board
for
the
right
to
be
heard
and
the
right
to
appear
through
a
no
vote
on
the
ballot.
we
were
denied
that
relief
and
we
proceeded
there
from
into
the
district
court.
i
think
that
our
situation
is
somewhat
different
from
the
argument
of
--
mr.
alex
l.
arguello
no,
we
did
not
mr.
justice.
we
thought
we're
accomplishing
that
purpose
by
stating
on
--
open
and
above
the
board.
we
did
not
seek
collective
bargaining
that
our
purpose
was
to
protect
our
individual
bargaining
rights.
mr.
alex
l.
arguello
no
mr.
justice,
i
do
not
think
we're
protected.
mr.
alex
l.
arguello
yes.
the
reason
first
and
foremost
is
that
this
provision
without
regard
to
whether
it's
equivalent
to
a
no
vote
or
not
is
the
eleventh
mandatory
instruction
on
the
ballot
and
the
instruction
sheet
that
comes
with
the
ballot.
it's
in
conflict
with
other
instructions
on
the
ballot,
in
clear
conflict.
mr.
alex
l.
arguello
yes,
the
--
mr.
alex
l.
arguello
there's
ballot
on
page
111
and
112
--
or
112
and
113
of
the
transcript
of
this
case
from
the
court
of
appeals
that
sets
forth
the
ballot
itself
and
the
instructions
to
the
ballot
which
is
a
clear
one.
it
does
not
include
the
wording
of
the
court.
it
does
not
include
the
wording
suggested
to
be
added
by
the
solicitor
general
and
i
don't
have
that
wording
at
hand.
mr.
alex
l.
arguello
it
states,
no
employee
is
required
to
vote.
if
less
than
the
majority
of
the
employees
cast
ballot
--
ballots,
no
representative
will
be
certified.
well
--
now,
to
carry
that
out
and
then
following
the
instruction,
the
solicitor
in
his
brief
states
that
having
told
this
to
the
voters
that
they
could
then
follow
out
of
course
of
conduct.
they
might
then
might
consider
them
in
order,
the
order
he
suggested,
i
could
do
no
better
is
that
you
cast
a
blank
ballot.
my
objection
to
their
casting
a
blank
ballot
is
that
on
the
ballot
itself,
there
is
an
instruction
that
you
mark
an
x
in
a
square,
but
you
--
then
--
in
the
instructions
that
are
on
page
113
that
you
place
the
ballot
in
envelope
a.
well,
my
question
is
if
you're
going
to
cast
a
blank
ballot,
you
put
a
blank
ballot
in
envelope
a
or
you
will
not
include
envelope
a.
you
just
include
the
cover
envelope.
it's
not
clear
how
you
class
--
cast
a
blank
ballot.
his
next
suggestion
was
and
i
think
it
was
a
good
one.
i
can't
think
of
anymore,
spoiled
a
ballot.
well,
the
ballot
on
its
face
states,
do
not
cut
mutely
or
spoil
it.
if
you
do
so,
return
the
ballot
at
once
to
the
mediator
and
obtain
a
new
one.
i
think
there's
a
conflict
there.
and
then
the
last
suggestion
that
the
solicitor
made
to
us
was,
cast
no
vote.
well,
on
the
face
of
the
ballot
it
says,
return
this
ballot
in
its
entirety,
in
instruction
three
under
notice.
i
think
what
you
created
is
more
confusion
than
it
was
created
in
the
--
in
the
original
instance
when
were
trying
to
figure
out
exactly
what
was
the
effect
of
a
no
--
of
none
voting.
mr.
alex
l.
arguello
well,
the
answer
to
that
is
simply
this
mr.
justice.
our
organization
is
spread
over
the
entire
united
states
and
the
territories
of
this
country.
i
have
difficulty
following
what
i
think
is
the
right
thing
to
do.
i
think
the
solicitor
general's
suggestions
were
not
sound.
i
don't
know
how
these
people
could
be
advised
and
i
hesitate
to
say
that
they
should
be
advised
to
ignore
the
instructions
of
a
government
agency,
mandatory
instructions.
these
people
are
not
learned
in
the
law.
certainly,
they
must
waiver
in
making
their
decision
no
matter
what
i
or
the
organization
told
them,
plus
i
think
it's
even
more
important
that
it
goes
even
further.
i
think
that
by
setting
up
the
mechanics
in
this
manner
that
were
slanting
and
weighing
the
thing
in
favor
of
the
union
vote.
now
i
don't
think
that
this
is
indicated
in
the
act.
i
don't
think
that
it
can
be
demonstrated
to
be
indicated
in
the
act.
i
believe
that
the
legislative
history,
the
admissions
of
the
solicitor
general
time
and
time
again
as
to
the
rights
of
the
employees
to
express
their
intention
to
be
individually
represented
to
--
enter
into
individual
bargaining
agreements
and
the
constant
practice
of
the
board
show
conclusively
the
existence
of
the
right
but
no
one
has
demonstrated
to
us
where
the
national
mediation
board
takes
on
itself
the
authority
to
distort
that
right,
to
change
it
in
any
way
to
limit
it,
but
that's
what
they
do
by
this
ballot.
in
addition
to
the
simple
business
of
trying
to
figure
out
what
you
do
with
this
eleven
instruction,
they've
created
a
situation
in
which
the
ballot
itself
is
slanted
or
biased
and
i
don't
think
that
this
procedure
is
based
upon
any
provision
in
the
act
and
i
think
that
in
this
particular
situation,
those
people
who
desire
to
indicate
their
preference
for
it,
individual
bargaining
representation
are
not
being
advised
fairly
of
their
rights
and
in
addition
to
that,
not
being
given
a
fair
opportunity
to
express
--
mr.
alex
l.
arguello
--
their
opinion.
mr.
alex
l.
arguello
i
think
in
that
situation,
if
the
national
mediation
board
made
a
decision
to
proceed
by
taking
up
signed
cards
that
this
was
--
is
within
the
rights
of
the
board.
where
they
got
into
the
problem
here
is
that
they
determined
to
have
an
election,
and
i
feel
that
where
they
do
determine
to
have
an
election,
that
they
must
conduct
it
in
a
fair
and
unequivocal
manner.
incidentally
with
respect
to
that
card
check
question
mr.
justice,
if
the
carrier
--
this
is
the
board
policy,
if
the
carrier
does
not
agree
to
a
card
check,
the
national
mediation
board
policy
is
--
has
been
uniformly
to
conduct
an
election,
a
ballot
box
election.
mr.
alex
l.
arguello
yes.
mr.
alex
l.
arguello
so
i
think,
however,
we're
not
concerned
with
that
problem
because
here,
the
board
decided
that
it
was
going
to
have
an
election,
what
they
might
have
done
otherwise,
we're
not
objecting
certainly.
mr.
alex
l.
arguello
i
sincerely
do.
mr.
alex
l.
arguello
i
sincerely
do,
mr.
justice.
mr.
alex
l.
arguello
yes,
and
i
think
that
the
--
there
are
two
reasons
from
my
feeling
that
way.
first
is
because
of
the
virginian
case
wherein
it
is
stated
that
the
non-voters
are
presumably
assenting
to
the
will.
mr.
alex
l.
arguello
that's
correct
and
this
creates
in
my
mind
a
great
area
of
confusion.
now
how
will
the
board
ever
be
able
to
determine
or
make
a
finding
or
infer
from
any
facts
just
what
the
will
of
the
non-voter
is?
they
have
on
the
one
hand
a
decision
of
this
court
wherein
it's
stated
that
they
were
presumably
assenting.
now
they
have
an
instruction
which
is
not
clear
to
me
on
its
face
where
they're
taking
a
position,
perhaps,
now
those
people
are
objecting.
i
think
this
is
a
long
assumption.
mr.
alex
l.
arguello
well,
i
think
the
solicitor
in
his
brief,
his
reply
brief
on
page
5
agrees
with
me
that
the
work
of
the
mediation
board
has
become
and
will
be
considerably
more
complicated
in
view
of
the
finding
in
the
virginian
case.
and
the
difficulty
of
squaring
it
now
with
the
rationale
that
this
instruction
is
going
to
designate
those
persons
not
voting
as
opposing
collective
bargaining
representation
--
mr.
alex
l.
arguello
--
and
its
answer
to
it
is
--
mr.
alex
l.
arguello
well,
the
reason
is
[attempt
to
laughter]
that
the
board
then
goes
on
to
say
that
this
being
the
case
that
they
will
have
to
remain
free,
especially
in
the
situation
in
which
the
balloting
did
not
produce
an
absolute
majority
of
the
voting
members
for
one
union
or
another.
the
board
would
have
to
remain
free
to
determine
some
appropriate
course
as
to
what
should
be
done.
now,
i
believe
that
this
appropriate
course
can
only
be
determined
by
a
reference
to
the
actual
will
of
the
non-voters
and
this
can
be
easily
done.
the
inertia
which
is
attached
to
bureaucratic
ruling,
i
appreciate
--
i
appreciate
sincerely
and
yet,
if
the
board's
position
is
that
they're
giving
us
everything
that
they
want,
that
they're
providing
freedom
from
the
employees,
why
not
give
us
the
clear
and
equivocal
statement.
let
us
vote
no.
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
