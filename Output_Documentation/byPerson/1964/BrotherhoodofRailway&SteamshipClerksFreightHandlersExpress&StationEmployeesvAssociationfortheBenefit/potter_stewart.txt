justice
potter
stewart
under
the
--
under
the
statute
of
the
--
there's
no
duty
to
have
an
election
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
board
could
find
out
by
other
means,
couldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
has
that
been
the
consistent
practice?
what
if
a
i
had
understood
that
--
it
wasn't
too
clear
to
me
here
but
at
least
at
some
stage
since
the
statute
has
been
in
existence,
if
a
majority
of
those
voting
designated
a
representative
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
what
if
i
want
to
certify?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
want
to
be
represented
by
a
--
some
union?
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
eight?
justice
potter
stewart
has
it
ever?
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
a
majority
of
all
the
employees?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
craft
or
class?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
announced
to
is
that
--
you're
asking
us
to
decide
this
case
not
on
the
record,
but
on
something
that's
happened
since.
justice
potter
stewart
unless
this
form.
justice
potter
stewart
well
you
--
you
said
this
worked
out
for
a
process
of
a
bit
of
collective
bargaining
where
the
--
were
the
appellees
involved
in
it?
justice
potter
stewart
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
between
you
and
the
board?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
other
parties
in
this
lawsuit
didn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
of
course
was
in
reference
to
the
railroad
industry
as
it
then
existed,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
are
all
these
--
or
this
--
this
statute
came
along
and
it
was
applicable
to
a
mature
industry
where
everything
was
established.
those
crafts
and
classes
were
established,
the
brotherhoods
were
all
established.
there
was
no
possibility
envisioned
of
any
craft
or
class
not
being
represented
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
by
a
union?
justice
potter
stewart
this
wasn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
made
applicable
to
the
airline
industry
until
when?
1936,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
had
a
recent
--
a
railroad
establishment
both
on
the
--
the
part
of
the
brotherhoods
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
on
the
part
of
the
management,
had
there
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
that.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
probably
the
problem.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
probably
the
basis
--
basic
problem
here
but
i
don't
kind
of
understand
it.
the
--
this
statute
in
fact
was
worked
out
by
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
brotherhoods
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
the
railroads
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
handed
to
congress
to
pass?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
see
how
you
rely
on
leedom
and
kyne.
well,
you
rely
on
the
dicta
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
(voice
overlap)
on
leedom
and
kyne
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
to
cover
this?
justice
potter
stewart
where
do
you
--
i
suppose
you're
going
to
tell
us
where
you
find
that.
justice
potter
stewart
that
seems
a
little
--
you
used
that
phrase
"speaking
through
their
unions".
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
assume
then
that
they've
already
got
a
representative
before
they
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
let's
say
it's
just
a
minority,
then
who
--
who
--
in
this
case,
what
evidence
is
there
that
the
employee
decides
upon
this
craft
or
class?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
has
been
terribly
circular
to
me.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
the
way
--
now
you're
saying
something
different
because
what
happened
in
this
case
is,
the
two
unions
agreed
as
to
what
group
of
employees
they
wanted
to
compete
for.
justice
potter
stewart
but,
this
wasn't
any,
any
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
decision
on
the
part
of
any
employees
so
far
as
this
record
shows?
justice
potter
stewart
but
historically,
isn't
the
--
isn't
it
true
and
i
suggested
earlier
in
a
question
that
at
the
time
that
this
statute
was
enacted,
it
was
all
pretty
well
settled
in
the
railroads,
who
were
the
firemen,
who
were
the
locomotive
engineers,
who
were
the
non-operating
brotherhoods
and
so
on
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
these
matters
we're
all
stratified,
weren't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
subsequently,
there
were
but
it
was
pretty
well
stratified
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
certainly
in
contrast
to
a
brand
new
airline
industry,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
--
(voice
overlap)
1936
or
1938.
i
don't
--
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
just
one
question
please,
but
don't
answer
at
length,
impinging
on
somebody
else's
time.
i
understand
your
argument
entirely
so
far
as
the
carrier
not
being
entitled
to
be
heard
on
this
question
of
craft
and
class,
you
also,
i
think
you
told
us
that
what
you
call
abne
is
not
entitled
to
be
heard
and
i
should
think
that
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
your
position
that
this
is
a
matter
for
decision
by
the
employees
or
their
--
or
their
representative.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
that
the
question
is
one
ultimately
be
determined
by
the
board
rather
than
by
the
employees
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
to
that
extent
you
differ
with
the
solicitor
general?
justice
potter
stewart
in
your
view
of
the
statute,
whose
element
function
is
it
to
determine
the
--
a
craft
or
class
in
any
given
case?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
that's
where
you
just
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
with
the
solicitor
general.
he
says
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
he
says
the
function
of
the
employees
or
their
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
representative?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
for
example,
if
the
unions
agree
that
they're
going
to
include
supervisors
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
then
the
board
might
say
no.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well
would
you
--
that's
what
they
did
recently
in
eastern
airlines,
don't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
yet
--
would
you'd
be
content
with
that?
justice
potter
stewart
presumably
--
presumably
though,
you
were
not
a
party
then
you
would
not
have
a
right
to
seek
review
with
any
adverse
decision
either.
justice
potter
stewart
any
decision
that
displeased
you
if
you
were
not
a
party.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
board
just
lets
you
in
there
as
a
--
as
a
witness,
would
that
satisfy
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
--
and
if
they
listen
to
you?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
all
that
you're
asking
now.
