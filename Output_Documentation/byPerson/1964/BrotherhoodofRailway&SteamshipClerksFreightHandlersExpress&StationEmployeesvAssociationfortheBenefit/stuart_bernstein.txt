mr.
stuart
bernstein
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
united's
petition
for
certiorari
raised
two
fundamental
issues.
one
was
the
craft
or
class
and
the
second
was
the
ballot.
they
simply
reversed
the
order
in
which
mr.
cox
have
spoken
these.
i
would
like
to
devote
the
primary
part,
if
not
all
of
my
time,
to
the
craft
or
class
question.
i
would
like
to
state
our
primary
thesis
and
then
back
off
to
review
it.
my
primary
thesis
is
that
the
carrier
or
employer
has
that
degree
of
interest
in
the
composition
of
a
bargaining
unit
of
its
employees.
it
has
such
a
potential
impact
on
its
organization,
on
its
efficiency,
on
its
way
of
doing
business
that
the
carrier
is
entitled
to
procedural,
not
substantive,
procedural
due
process
in
the
manner
by
which
that
decision
is
made.
and
we
are
asking
here
no
more
than
every
employer
as
ever
--
has
always
been
accorded
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
as
i
develop
this,
i
will
show
that
in
this
respect,
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
national
labor
relations
act
do
not
differ
in
their
fundamental
purposes.
now
i
would
like
to
discuss
a
little
bit
what
the
nature
of
the
craft
or
class
here
is
that
we
are
discussing
to
show
that
our
argument,
our
approach,
our
desire
to
be
heard
is
not
a
facetious
one.
there
is
some
hold
of
its
substance
to
it.
the
craft
or
class
is
composed
of
approximately
13,000
employees
and
three
major
classifications
of
work.
first,
they're
the
employees
that
we
might
call
the
office
and
clerical.
these
include
at
the
one
extreme,
such
highly
skilled
employees
as
our
electro
--
electronic
computer
operators.
it
includes
our
typists,
clerks,
receptionists,
switchboard
operators,
employees
of
this
category
who
have
no
contact
with
the
public,
but
who
are
generally
highly
skilled.
the
second
category
of
employees
are
what
we
call
the
public
contact
employees,
ticket
agents,
reservations
clerks,
vacation
booking
agents,
station
agents,
passenger
agents,
employees
whose
primary
duty
is
to
be
in
contact
with
the
public,
representing
the
airline
in
this
respect.
the
third
category
of
employees
who
are
in
this
conglomerate
craft
or
class
are
what
we
call
ramp
and
stores
employees
and
these
are
employees
who
are
primary
laborers.
they
clean
the
airplanes,
they
put
the
baggage
on
board,
they
take
the
baggage
off,
they
handle
the
material
in
the
storage
room,
they're
primary
laboring
employees.
now
it
is
our
contention
that
we
would
like
to
have
the
national
mediation
board
listen
to
us,
let
us
explain
why
we
think
that
a
single
craft
or
class
for
this
entire
group
is
no
longer
appropriate
if
ever
it
was
certainly
not
at
united
air
lines.
we
think
we
can
offer
some
significant
evidence.
now
it
maybe
that
after
the
board
has
heard
our
evidence,
it
may
disagree
with
us.
but
i
quite
agree
with
the
suggestion
that
was
made
by
mr.
justice
white
that
our
right
to
procedural
administrative
due
process
do
not
--
does
not
mean
that
we
are
entitled
to
just
--
to
judicial
review
of
that
decision,
and
this
is
why
this
not
a
switchmen's
case.
we
are
not
asking
for
judicial
review
of
a
substantive
determination
of
the
administrative
authority.
all
we
are
asking
is
that
the
board
is
required
to
make
the
determination.
now
part
of
the
confusion
in
this
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
it
makes
no
difference,
as
de
facto
it
makes
no
difference
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
we
--
this
is
why
that
it's
taking
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
--
i
agree
with
you
your
honor.
the
reason
is
that
it's
taking
--
because
we
have
been
accorded,
because
carriers
have
consistently
been
accorded
this
position
as
a
de
facto
party
that
this
matter
has
not
been
brought
up
for
review
until
this
time.
it's
been
taking
this
long.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
we
got
neither,
we
got
neither.
now
the
interesting
fact
is
that
despite
the
representations
that
the
mediation
board
has
never
allowed
a
carrier
to
participate
as
a
party
in
this
manner.
i
would
like
to
read
one
thing
at
the
outset
before
i
get
further
into
this
argument.
this
is
one
of
the
cases
that
i
refer
to
where
i
have
made
the
flat
statement
in
our
brief
that
this
is
the
first
major
craft
or
class
determination,
major
craft
or
class
case
in
which
a
carrier
has
not
been
allowed
to
participate
on
at
least
a
de
facto
basis
and
i
cited
some
examples
and
then
the
reply
brief
which
was
filed
two
days
ago
tried
to
explain
this
on
the
very
narrow
differences
in
each
one.
but
one
of
these
that
i
cited
was
northeast
airlines,
a
1960
case
and
there,
the
transport
workers
union
had
an
argument
with
northeast
airlines
about
what
the
scope
of
the
craft
or
class
should
be,
whether
it
would
include
certain
employees
or
not
and
they're
finally
tired
of
arguing
with
the
airline
and
they
filed
a
petition
to
represent
the
entire
craft
or
class
including
everybody.
now
there
was
only
a
single
labor
organization
and
the
employer
protested
and
asked
for
a
hearing
and
a
hearing
was
granted
on
what
the
craft
or
class
should
include
there
and
i
want
to
read
one
sentence
from
what
the
board
said
in
that
case
and
no
more
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
i
have
the
reference
but
not
the
quotation.
what
i'm
reading
from
is
three
national
mediation
board
determinations
at
page
90
and
the
quotation
is
as
follows.
"since
the
passage
of
the
amended
act
in
1934,
it
has
been
the
board's
unvarying
practice
in
cases
similar
to
the
instant
dispute
to
determine
the
eligibility
of
disputed
positions,"
mow
the
only
disputants
here
were
northeast
airlines
community,
"by
holding
hearings
were
necessary
as
was
done
here,
and
then
arriving
at
a
decision
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
before
it,
the
board
will
continue
its
past
policy
in
this
instance."
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
it
was
certainly
necessary
there
where
there
was
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
--
a
dispute
between
the
carrier
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes
sir.
let
me
back
off
now,
let
me
back
off.
we
have
had
this
problem
presented
in
the
briefs
your
honor.
up
to
this
point,
up
until
two
days
ago
the
primary
argument
laid
against
united's
position
has
been
that
the
board
in
fact
made
a
determination
here.
it
did
exercise
its
duty
and
the
duty
that
it
exercised
was
to
follow
its
1947
determination.
now
we
responded
to
that
by
pointing
out
that
on
this
record,
no
such
conclusion
could
be
drawn.
however,
the
argument
was
made
by
the
interveners,
the
railway
labor
executives
association,
it
was
made
by
the
government.
this
is
the
way
the
government
argued
its
point
and
that
it's
still
persisted
in
here
by
mr.
highsaw.
now
the
government
says,
however,
the
board
--
we
concede
that
the
board
did
not
make
a
determination.
in
fact,
not
only
as
it
conceded
but
in
their
reply
brief,
they
insist
that
the
board
could
not
make
a
determination.
they
say
now
that
since
two
unions
agreed,
that
ended
it
and
the
board
could
go
no
further.
now
if
i
could
rely
on
that,
i
assume
i
would
not
have
to
show
that
the
record
establishes
that
the
board
made
no
determination
because
this
is
now
the
thesis
that
the
government
is
advancing,
but
the
other
two
parties,
the
railway
labor
executives
association
and
the
union,
insist
the
board
did
make
a
determination.
so
i
will
briefly
have
to
review
just
what
did
happened
here.
now,
when
united
asked
to
be
heard
on
this
question,
the
board
responded
by
saying,
you
cannot
be
heard
for
two
reasons.
one,
you
can't
be
a
party
to
the
proceeding
and
two,
the
two
unions
are
in
agreement.
they
said
that
in
two
letters.
they
said
that
in
a
public
statement
and
it's
repeated
in
the
affidavit
of
the
executive
secretary
of
the
board
which
is
part
of
this
record.
now
we
thought
that
made
out
of
previous
case
that
the
board
had
made
no
determination
but
simply
accepted
what
the
union
said.
but
it
was
argued
nonetheless
that
the
board
did
make
a
determination
to
adhere
to
its
1947
determination.
well,
in
--
our
brief
sets
forth
what
happened
in
that
1947
determination.
this
was
very
early
after
the
war
when
the
airlines
were
expanding,
three
formative
stages
in
the
industry
and
nobody
was
quite
sure
where
these
things
were
going
to
go.
and
the
board
did
after
hearing,
make
a
determination
for
four
airlines,
not
including
united
that
this
bargaining
unit
would
be
appropriate.
in
1953
however,
it
said
that
because
this
was
not
being
followed
generally,
it
would
have
to
reexamine
the
matter.
and
in
1956
it
did
and
then
observed
that
only
six
out
of
30
carriers
were
following
this
craft
or
class
and
it
did
make
a
reexamination,
and
in
fact,
it
did
hold
a
bargaining
unit
appropriate
of
a
part
of
a
craft
or
class
which
had
been
found
appropriate
in
1947.
now
we
pointed
these
things
out
in
our
brief
and
the
response
was
that
these
were
unique
circumstances.
the
affidavit
of
the
mediation
board
here
says
that
the
reason
for
this
is
that
the
circumstances
in
these
cases
were
unique.
well,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
there
is
no
possible
way
of
knowing
if
the
circumstances
were
not
also
unique
here
without
some
kind
of
hearing,
with
some
kind
of
evidentiary
proceeding.
now
after
this
case
started,
in
december
of
1963,
a
dispute
arose
at
eastern
airlines,
a
dispute
about
the
same
craft
or
class,
and
there
the
international
association
of
machinists
said
the
board
ought
to
stick
by
the
original
craft
or
class.
the
international
brotherhood
of
teamsters
asked
for
something
else
and
the
eastern
airlines
asked
for
a
third
thing,
and
the
board
in
that
decision
in
december
1963,
in
referring
to
this
1947
decision
said,
"moreover,
in
most
cases,
this
trend
is
contrary
to
the
early
determinations."
the
early
determination
thing
the
1947
decision
and
it
again
found
appropriate
a
craft
or
class
consisting
of
less
in
the
entire
grouping
found
appropriate
in
1947.
now
we
submit
on
that
record,
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
the
board
has
adhered
to
a
1947
decision
under
the
basis
of
no
hearing
when
in
fact
it
has
not
followed
that
in
these
decisions
to
which
i
have
referred.
now
beyond
that,
our
record
--
our
affidavit
shows
that
after
this
application
was
filed
with
the
board
and
it
deter
--
the
application
was
for
this
entire
craft
or
class,
the
iam,
the
machinists
and
the
brotherhood
sat
down
and
had
a
discussion
about,
again
dividing
it
up
in
a
different
way.
the
ramp
and
stores
employees
about
whom
i
spoke,
the
laboring
group
had
been
represented
for
over
20
years
as
a
separate
craft
or
class,
and
since
1948
they
had
been
represented
by
the
machinists.
and
the
machinists
resented
somehow
this
attempt
to
take
over
their
bargaining
rights
and
combining
them
into
this
larger
group,
and
there
were
some
discussions
between
them
about
rating
and
collaboration
with
the
company
and
there
was
--
out
of
this
falling
out
that
they
agreed
to
have
this
--
the
election
on
a
larger
group.
well,
subsequent
to
that,
in
november
of
1963
--
november
of
1962,
the
two
unions
sat
down
again,
and
again
tried
to
work
out
a
deal
to
exclude
the
ramp
and
stores
employees
and
there's
a
letter
in
the
affidavits
here
from
the
iam
representative,
to
the
brotherhood
representative
saying
that
he
had
discussed
this
with
the
national
mediation
board
and
the
mediation
board
said
if
the
parties
could
agree
to
that,
they
go
and
have
it
that
basis.
so
we
think
it's
quite
clear
from
this
record
that
there
has
been
no
reliance
by
this
board
on
what
happened
in
1947,
rather
they
have
relied
as
the
solicitor
says
on
the
agreement
of
two
unions
and
nothing
else
and
i
must
--
i
have
to
go
into
this
to
get
rid
of
the
argument
that
is
still
persisting
here
that
the
board
did
exercise
its
duty
and
did
make
a
determination.
i
agree
with
the
solicitor
that
the
board
did
not.
now
--
yes
sir.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
the
determination,
the
duty
and
power
is
that
of
the
national
mediation
board.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
no
question.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that's
right.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that's
correct
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
and
i
--
i
would
like
to
delve
into
the
legislative
history
a
bit
to
establish
clearly
that
it
was
not
the
employees
who
had
that
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
solicitor's
original
brief
before
he
changes
position
here
on
page
60,
he
tells
us
what
i
agree
with.
he
says,
the
act
was
not
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes
sir.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
it
may.
it
has
a
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
the
board
still
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
he
says,
when
they
all
agree,
the
board
cannot
do
anything
else.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that's
what
he
says.
i
say
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
oh
yes.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
oh,
of
course,
we're
talking
about
employees
who
fall
within
the
definition.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes
sir,
of
course.
i
say
that
the
board
always
has
this
power
and
in
fact
it
has
the
duty
and
i
will
demonstrate
to
you
and
i
have
set
forth
in
my
brief
the
clear
history
and
the
board's
own
statements
which
show
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
--
this
very
thing.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well
sir,
i
have
cited
one
example
which
i
read
earlier
from
the
nlrb
itself
where
there
was
--
and
the
solicitor
also
says
that
there's
only
one
union
involved
and
that's
enough
also.
they
don't
have
to
--
it
does
not
have
to
be
more
than
one
union.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
this
northeast
case
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that
one
union
wanted
a
broader
unit
in
the
case
i
cited
and
the
employer
protested,
and
the
hearing
was
held
on
the
point.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
and
the
board
came
out
with
something
else
actually.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that's
correct.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that's
correct.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that's
correct.
i
have
cited
that
example.
now
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
page
60
of
this
--
yes.
and
it
says
in
the
middle
of
the
page.
the
act
does
not
provide
any
specific
guidelines
for
or
oppose
any
specific
prohibitions
upon
the
board
in
defining
the
electorate.
the
matter
has
been
left
to
the
board's
discretion
to
decide
in
a
case
to
case
basis
in
the
light
of
the
general
policies
of
the
statute.
going
on,
commissioner
eastman
explained
to
the
house
committee
that
in
drafting
the
bill,
consideration
had
been
given
to
defining
crafts
or
classes
but
that
it
had
been
decided
to
leave
it
to
the
board
to
make
these
determinations.
well
now,
we
cited
that
back
in
our
reply
brief
and
the
solicitor
now
says,
we
overly
we
misstated
his
position.
i
simply
paraphrased
what
he
had
said
in
our
brief
if
it
please
the
court.
now
the
--
i
must
admit
that
the
section
2
ninth
for
the
railway
labor
act
is
not
the
model
of
clarity
of
draftsmanship.
but
i
have
cited
a
few
what
commissioner
eastman
said.
he
said
that
it
would
be
left
to
the
board
to
make
these
determinations.
now
it
is
quite
sure
that
there
was
an
element
of
voluntarism
because
as
it
had
been
repeatedly
pointed
out,
the
industry
was
quite
well
organized
at
the
time
the
act
was
adopted,
but
the
voluntarism
was
the
voluntarism
of
all
parties
including
the
carrier.
in
the
1937,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
held
void
a
certification
where
the
board
did
not
hold
the
hearing
to
find
out
what
the
craft
or
class
had
been
by
agreement
between
the
employees
and
the
carrier.
the
carrier
is
one
of
the
parties
to
this
as
we
see.
and
i
cite
--
this
is
not
in
my
brief.
i
had
no
occasion
to
do
it
originally.
i
didn't
anticipate
this
change,
88
f.2d
757.
so
the
voluntarism
included
the
carrier
and
it
was
reflected
in
agreements
which
had
been
made
not
something
the
employees
did
in
the
abstract.
now
when
the
wagner
act
was
adopted
one
year
later
in
1935,
this
was
made
crystal
clear.
section
9
(a)
of
the
wagner
act
in
adopting
the
section,
the
senate
committee,
they're
discussing
how
craft
or
class
would
be
determined,
at
least
to
say
about
the
craft
of
class,
now
this
is
the
wagner
act.
they
said,
obviously,
there
could
be
no
choice
of
representatives
and
no
bargaining
units
for
such
--
unless
such
units
for
such
purposes
are
first
determined
and
employees
themselves
cannot
choose
these
units,
this
is
the
wagner
act,
because
the
units
must
be
determined
before
it
can
be
known
whether
the
employees
are
eligible
to
participate
in
a
choice
of
any
kind.
this
is
the
problem
that
mr.
justice
stewart
was
inquiring
about
and
then
the
senate
committee
goes
on.
the
supervision
is
similar
to
section
2
of
1934
amendments
to
the
railway
labor
act
and
it
cites
that
part
of
section
2
ninth
which
says,
in
the
conduct
of
any
election
for
the
purpose
herein
indicated,
the
board
shall
designate
who
may
participate
in
the
election
and
establish
the
rules
to
govern
the
election.
so
one
year
later
at
least,
in
1935,
the
congress
thought
that
it
was
doing
the
same
thing
in
the
wagner
act
with
respect
to
agency
determination
of
collective
bargaining
units
as
had
been
done
the
previous
year
under
the
railway
labor
act.
now
the
board
thinks
the
same
thing.
they
have
repeatedly
talked
about
their
duty
to
make
craft
or
class
determinations.
now
--
and
incidentally,
shortly
after
the
wagner
act
was
adopted,
this
court
held
invalid
a
wisconsin
statute
which
did
give
to
employees
the
right
to
select
bargaining
units,
that
was
in
the
la
crosse
case
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
now
the
most
recent
significant
craft
or
class
case
prior
to
this
one
was
the
case
involving
the
pilots
and
the
flight
engineers
at
united
air
lines
by
which
i'm
sure
that
many
of
you
are
quite
familiar.
there,
a
group
of
united
employees,
the
flight
engineers,
who
had
been
separately
barred
to
organize
on
their
own
since
at
least
1949,
had
their
own
unions
since
1949
where
the
subject
to
a
petition
by
the
united
air
line
pilots
by
the
airline
pilots
association
to
enlarge
the
craft
or
class
to
take
in
the
engineers.
the
mediation
board
held
a
hearing
and
it
allowed
united
to
participate
on
this
limited
basis
to
which
the
solicitor
has
referred,
and
incidentally,
the
evidence
of
united
was
crucial
in
that
case
because
obviously,
the
--
since
the
significant
factors
are
the
nature
of
the
job,
the
community
of
interest
of
employees,
transferability,
the
interchangeability
and
their
training
is
the
carrier
who
peculiarly
has
this
knowledge
and
so
they
had
to
rely
on
what
united
had
to
offer
in
that
case
in
order
to
determine
the
case.
well,
after
a
long
hearing,
a
committee
that
the
board
appointed
determined
that
there
should
be
a
single
craft
or
class,
putting
together
the
pilots
and
the
engineers.
you
may
recall
that
as
soon
as
that
decision
was
announced,
the
flight
engineers
of
six
airlines
struck.
the
engineers
of
united
did
not
strike,
they
litigated
and
they
made
a
little
bit
the
same
kind
of
argument
that
the
solicitor
makes
here.
they
said,
we
voluntarily
on
our
own
set
up
this
craft
or
class
a
long
time
ago
and
you
haven't
got
the
right
to
change
it,
that's
what
they
said
and
this
was
the
argument
that
came
up.
the
district
court
dismissed
their
petition.
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
and
they
applied
for
certiorari
in
this
court
and
in
the
opposition
to
cert,
the
petition
and
opposition
of
certiorari
here,
the
mediation
board
discussed
that
argument
and
said
this
to
this
court.
the
petitioner
relies
in
the
fact
that
a
representative
of
the
flight
engineer
had
passed
bargaining
with
the
carrier.
however,
congress
has
charged
the
board
or
its
committee
with
a
duty
to
find
the
craft
or
class
to
be
whatever
it
is
and
not
what
it
used
to
be
and
they
went
on
to
say,
where
the
job
has
changed
because
of
technological
development,
then
the
board
must
recognize
a
change.
well,
i
submit
that
the
board
must
do
the
same
thing
here
and
how
is
it
to
know
unless
it
has
a
hearing.
it
cannot
sit
back
and
rely
in
the
fact
that
two
unions,
after
a
squabble
between
themselves,
agreed
on
where
to
draw
the
battle
lines,
that
tells
nothing.
if
the
board
has
this
kind
of
a
duty
which
has
been
charged
to
it
by
congress,
how
can
it
possibly
abrogate
this
to
the
accidental
agreement
of
two
unions
in
this
kind
of
a
point?
now,
i
have
referred
to
the
northeast
case
where
i've
shown
that
the
board
practice
has
been
inconsistent
with
the
board
position
here.
there
is
currently
going
on
at
this
very
time,
a
craft
or
class
hearing
involving
united
air
lines,
eastern
airlines
and
seaboard
world
airlines,
an
attempt
of
a
union
to
carve
out
of
the
mechanics
craft
or
class,
a
part
of
the
skilled
employees
of
this
group.
the
n.m.b.
is
conducting
a
hearing
on
that
and
not
only
are
the
airlines
participating
as
interested
witnesses,
they
have
entered
their
appearances
as
parties.
they
have
put
evidence
on
and
in
fact,
they
had
been
the
first
parties
to
present
their
--
the
evidence
of
the
case.
now
the
reason
is
quite
clear
as
i
pointed
out.
there
is
no
possible
way
that
you
can
know
how
these
things
should
be
determined
unless
you
rely
on
the
carrier.
and
this
is
what
the
board
said
in
this
eastern
airline
case
that
was
decided
in
1963.
and
in
this
quotation,
they
give
lip
service
to
the
point
that
the
carrier
can't
really
be
a
party
and
then
going
on
to
say
that
he
really
is
a
party.
eastern
airlines
and
i'm
quoting
for
the
board
determination.
"eastern
airlines,
the
carrier
here
involved,
contends
for
a
grouping
of
employees
contrary
to
either
of
the
contesting
unions."
now
if
the
solicitor
was
right,
you'll
think
that
the
limits
of
the
dispute
would
be
what
the
two
unions
want,
but
here,
eastern
airlines
had
a
third
position.
"it
should
be
observed",
continues
the
board,
"that
under
the
railway
labor
act,
the
carrier
is
not
a
party
in
representation
disputes".
this
is
a
disclaimer.
however,
in
the
board's
investigation
of
such
matters
under
section
2
ninth
of
the
act,
it
must
rely
on
the
carrier
for
information
needed
in
considering
dispute
--
the
dispute.
accordingly,
the
views
of
the
carrier
on
matters
of
this
nature
had
been
received
and
taken
into
account.
now,
i
submit
that
there's
no
other
possible
way
for
fulfilling
the
mandate
of
the
statute
for
the
board
to
exercise
its
discretion
to
make
a
craft
or
class
determination
then
to
do
just
this.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
i
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
this
is
the
1963
case
which
came
up
after
our
case.
i
refer
to
you
your
honors
to
the
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes,
but
however
the
board
did
allow
the
carrier
to
participate.
i
refer
to
the
case
that's
now
going
on,
right
now
that
the
aircraft
mechanics,
fraternal
association
in
which
united
is
participating
as
a
whole
car
--
a
full
party.
it's
presenting
witnesses,
it's
cross-examining,
it's
going
to
file
briefs
to
full
status,
but
lip
service
is
still
given
to
this
document
that
you
can't
be
a
party
to
a
representation
proceeding.
i
think
the
reason
for
that
is
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes
sir,
ultimately,
ultimately.
but
if
you
please
mr.
justice
black,
my
point
is
--
my
constitutional
ground
does
not
depend
on
a
finding
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
my
point
is
that
the
statute
is
completely
consistent
with
the
position
i
take
here
in
that
the
reading
of
the
statute
being
given
by
the
board
is
the
unconstitutional
aspect
of
this
case.
it's
the
administrative
practice
not
the
statute
and
i
think
that
the
statute
clearly
supports
our
position
here.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
the
statute
does
not
require
a
hearing
per
se.
what
the
statute
requires
is
a
determination
by
the
mediation
board
of
the
appropriate
craft
or
class
and
i
think
the
wagner
act
history
of
the
following
here
makes
that
clear
and
the
testimony
of
commissioner
eastman
when
the
act
was
adopted
in
1934
makes
that
clear.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well
sir,
we
--
we
--
i
think
it
would
require
judicial
review
if
after
hearing,
you
came
out
with
an
arbitrary
decision,
but
i
think
if
the
board
did
here
(voice
overlap)
--
pardon
sir.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
i
--
sir,
i
do
not
believe
it
does.
but
if
it
does,
i
think
there
are
plenty
of
distinctions
that
are
present
in
the
switchmen's
case.
for
example,
the
switchmen's
case
was
a
case
brought
by
a
union
which
claimed
that
an
improper
craft
or
class
determination
had
been
made
and
the
court
observed
there
that
the
right
had
been
created
by
congress
and
therefore
it
was
up
to
congress
to
limit
the
right
in
any
way.
the
right
we
assert
here
is
not
a
right
created
by
congress,
but
a
constitutional
right
we
have
not
to
have
our
business
interfered
with
in
an
arbitrary
manner
of
this
kind.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
no
sir.
you
held
that
the
union
did
not
have
that
right.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
you
held
in
this
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
my
argument
is
--
yes,
that's
correct
at
this
point.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
the
union
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
constitutionally
speaking
your
honor,
the
union
has
no
constitutional
right
to
be
a
collective
bargaining
representative
and
this
is
what
the
basis
of
the
holding
in
the
switchmen's
case
because
the
observation
was
made
that
the
right
had
been
created
by
congress.
this
was
the
right
to
be
a
collective
bargaining
representative
and
then,
having
been
created
by
congress,
it
could
be
limited
by
congress
and
the
court
did
observe
there,
the
constitutional
issues
aside,
there
was
--
there
was
no
need
to
provide
for
a
judicial
review,
but
we
are
not
asking
for
judicial
review
of
the
substance
of
this
determination.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
we're
not
asking
for
that.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
i
think
that
the
difference
is
your
honor
that
you
could
set
it
aside
on
our
petition
only
if
we
could
demonstrate
that
it
was
absolutely
contrary
to
any
of
the
evidence
that
was
presented
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
the
ordinary
standard.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
it
may
well
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
your
honor
that
the
board
has
always
accorded
the
union
hearing.
when
the
union
has
asked
for
it,
it
has
always
accorded
that.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
--
(voice
overlap)
in
this
case.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
no,
but
that
would
be
a
statutory
argument.
that
would
be
a
statutory
argument
for
the
union.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that
is
correct
sir.
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
and
i
say
that
the
statute
is
not
inconsistent
with
that
in
any
respect.
i
would
like
to
also
refer
that
respect
to
the
jurisdictional
point
that
in
the
general
committee
cases
which
were
decided
the
same
day
as
switchmen's
was
decided,
this
court
said,
it
was
not
passing
on
whether
judicial
authority
could
be
exercised
to
require
the
mediation
board
to
exercise
its
duty
under
section
2
ninth.
that
question
was
reserved
and
it
really
is
that
reservation
to
which
we
are
addressing
ourselves
not
to
a
reversal
of
switchmen's,
because
we
say
here,
we're
asking
you
to
tell
the
mediation
board
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
--
to
exercise
its
duty.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well
sir,
it
may
well
be
but
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
get
to
that
point
because
we
are
not
asking
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
--
for
any
substantive
determination
of
our
--
a
review
of
any
substantive
determination
of
the
board.
we
may
subsequently
come
to
that,
but
this
is
certainly
not
our
position
here.
our
position
here
only
is
that
the
board
required
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well
your
honor,
we
may
come
to
that.
we
may
come
to
that.
the
switchmen's
case
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
the
switchmen's
case
as
you
know
has
created
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
this
area,
but
i
don't
think
we
have
to
overrule
that
to
get
to
this
point
because
the
switchmen's
case
was
a
review
of
a
subsequent
request
for
a
review
of
a
substantive
determination
which
we
are
not
asking.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
full
and
exhaustive
hearings.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that's
correct.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that's
correct.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
toward
that
sir,
we
think
we're
a
party
to
the
craft
or
class
aspect
of
this
dispute.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
alright.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
this
is
part
of
the
problem
here,
it's
the
--
it's
the
terminology
used
when
the
board
says
for
example,
we
will
allow
you
to
participate
to
present
your
views,
but
not
as
a
party.
it
comes
out
in
the
same
thing
also.
they
could
give
lip
service
for
that
statement
but
nonetheless
allow
the
full
participation
to
any
extent
that
we
currently
have.
so
it
comes
out
to
the
same
thing
in
that
--
in
that
respect.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
yes.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
they're
doing
it
right
now
with
united
air
lines
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
--
and
in
other
cases.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well
certainly,
we
could
contend
with
that.
i
don't
think
we'd
be
here,
sir.
we
would
be
--
we
would
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
there
is
--
so
long
as
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
mr.
justice
stewart,
so
long
as
switchmen's
stands,
i
think
it
is
--
as
mr.
justice
black
points
out,
there
is
--
there
is
no
review
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
--
by
a
union
or
anybody.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
there's
simply
no
review
of
any
determination
of
the
board.
so
certainly,
that
aspect
of
it
would
cause
as
no
difficulty.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
if
they
let
us
in
to
make
our
position
clear.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that's
right
--
and
listen
to
it,
pay
some
attention
to
us
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
we
--
that's
correct.
we
have
some
interest
in
this.
it's
--
it's
very
practical
that
one
of
the
letters
and
evidence
here
indicates
that
the
brotherhood
is
still
claiming
even
now
seniority
rights
of
the
laboring
employees
to
go
into
the
clerical
and
the
public
contact
jobs
because
of
its
prior
contract
at
capital
airlines,
a
dispute
we
have
before
this
court
last
october
in
which
they
said
that
the
contracts
survive
simply
as
a
matter
of
course
after
the
merger.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well
sir,
we're
in
a
little
different
position.
it
refuses
the
bargain
that
employers
are
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
primary
difference
is
that
we
are
subject
to
the
federal
aviation
act
which
says
that
a
condition
of
holding
our
certificate
was
that
we
comply
with
the
railway
labor
act,
and
then
a
proceeding
before
the
civil
aeronautics
board
for
a
violation
of
the
railway
labor
act,
the
civil
aeronautics
board
will
not
looking
behind
any
determination
of
the
national
mediation
board
so
that
we
would
be
pretty
effectively
closed
out.
there
is
simply
no
review
procedure
as
there
is
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
but
we
can't
raise
that
at
that
juncture,
we're
just
through.
there's
no
other
way
to
do
it
because
they
may
not
be
so
kind
as
to
proceed
by
a
suit
in
equity
as
was
done
in
the
virginian
case.
they
just
make
all
the
other
arguments
in
cab
and
say,
"these
fellows
are
violating
the
act
and
we
want
you
to
take
up
their
certificate,"
and
we'd
have
no
defense.
i
would
like
to
spend
about
two
minutes
on
the
ballot
point,
if
i
may,
to
please
the
court.
here
again,
there's
been
a
certain
shift
of
position
on
the
part
of
the
government
counsel.
in
the
lower
courts,
the
argument
was
made
that
section
2
fourth
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
says
the
majority
of
employees
will
have
the
right
to
select
the
bargaining
agent.
it
was
argued
that
this
meant
the
employees
had
a
duty
to
select.
they
had
no
right
not
to
have
representation
and
this
position
has
disavowed
now
by
the
government
in
the
court
here.
they
now
contend
that
not
voting
is
the
same
as
voting
no,
this
is
what
their
brief
now
tells
us,
the
equivalent
or
the
same.
this
of
course
is
what
prompts
your
question,
mr.
justice
brennan,
"if
it
does,
why
not
say
so"?
well
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
which
aspect
sir?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
that's
correct.
he
--
he
did
say
the
same
thing.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
sir,
it's
not
so
and
the
reason
is
that
a
simple
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
sir,
so
far
as
the
government
was
concerned,
the
--
the
first
time
i
have,
i'm
familiar
with
--
they're
having
[inaudible]
it
was
in
their
brief
for
this
court
--
their
opening
brief
to
this
court.
that's
the
first
disavowal
of
that
and
i
participated
in
this
case
--
in
this
case
from
its
origin
from
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint
here.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
oh,
certainly,
certainly.
i
--
i
think
that
there
may
be
no
virtue
in
consistency
but
nonetheless,
it
makes
it
rather
difficult
for
a
counsel
to
be
shifting
ground
and
try
the
defendant
consistent
arguments.
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
when
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
--
and
both
the
national
labor
relations
act
were
first
adopted,
the
--
the
position
of
the
board
both
was
that
a
union
would
be
certified
only
if
--
if
it
received
an
absolute
majority
of
all
the
eligible
voters
and
at
such
a
time,
having
no
on
the
ballot
was
a
meaningless
point
because
you
have
to
have
an
absolute
number
of
votes
cast.
and
so,
whether
an
employee
didn't
vote
or
voted
no
was
a
matter
of
indifference.
but
then
in
the
virginian
case,
a
--
an
attack
was
made
against
the
national
mediation
board
that
it
had
certified
a
union
on
the
basis
of
less
than
a
majority
of
the
votes
cast
and
hence
was
in
conflict
with
section
2
fourth.
but
there,
a
majority
had
participated
although
majority
had
not
voted
for
the
union
that
it
was
served
by,
it
was
a
majority
of
a
majority
and
the
court
said,
the
supreme
court
at
that
point
said
that
this
is
perfectly
permissible
because
the
non-voter
will
be
presumed
to
have
ascended
to
the
will
of
the
majority
of
those
who
did
vote
otherwise,
you
could
frustrate
the
elective
process
indefinitely
by
the
indifferent
voter
simply
staying
away.
now,
this
was
the
justification.
in
1947,
in
the
opinion
of
attorney
general
clark,
this
was
repeated
when
the
board
asked
his
advice
on
its
voting
procedures.
now,
we
submit
that
if
you
justify
certifying
on
the
basis
of
less
than
an
absolute
majority
on
a
presumption
that
the
non-voter
is
presumed
to
ascent
to
the
will
of
the
majority
of
those
voting,
you
cannot
at
the
same
time
say
the
non-voting
is
equivalent
to
voting
no.
it's
simply
a
logical
impossibility.
now,
we
set
out
an
example
to
show
to
demonstrate
this
in
our
brief,
the
solicitor
replies
while
we're
arguing
conclusions
from
facts.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
you
must
set
up
the
machinery
so
that
a
rational
conclusion
can
be
made
from
the
facts.
if
you
do
not
allow
a
place
to
vote
no,
you
can
make
no
conclusion
and
no
presumption
whatsoever
about
the
intent
of
the
non-voter.
perhaps
he
was
indifferent,
perhaps
he
was
hostile,
perhaps
he
wanted
to
vote
no.
you
can
tell
nothing
at
all
about
this,
and
we
submit
that
it
is
not
the
same
to
say
that
voting
no
is
equivalent
of
not
casting
a
vote.
they
are
entirely
different,
and
we
have
set
forth
a
very
simple
mathematical
demonstration
to
show
this.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
no,
sir,
it
does
not.
it's
an
entirely
different
point,
none
at
all.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
the
point
on
this
one
is,
your
honor,
that
we
believe
that
when
the
statute
says
that
the
majority
of
a
craft
or
class
of
employees
have
the
right
to
select
a
bargaining
representative,
that
you
must
have
a
ballot
which
permits
them
to
cast
a
reasonable
--
a
meaningful
choice,
and
they're
not
being
given
that
choice
if
they're
not
being
allowed
a
chance
to
vote
no
and
hence
is
in
violation
of
the
statute.
this
is
strictly
a
statutory
argument,
not
a
constitutional
one.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
if
the
statute
states
that
the
majority
of
the
employee
shall
have
this
right
and
if
the
form
of
ballot
used
does
not
give
them
this
right,
then
i
think
that
the
statute
is
being
violated.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
not
a
question
of
review,
it's
a
review
in
the
sense
that
leedom
versus
kyne
was
reviewed
and
that
one
might
say
that
that
was
a
review,
but
the
court
disclaimed
that
and
said
it
was
not
really
reviewing
it.
it
was
simply
striking
down
something
that
was
contrary
to
the
statute,
and
i
think
that
it's
clear
that
when
--
by
not
allowing
the
employees
to
vote
no
here,
you
are
in
effect
contravening
section
2
fourth
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
i
think
if
you
put
a
square
for
voting
no,
you
wouldn't
need
the
instruction
because
an
employee
who
didn't
want
to
vote
for
union
will
vote
no.
you
wouldn't
have
to
have
not
vote
and
then
guess
as
to
why
he
didn't
vote.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
pardon?
mr.
stuart
bernstein
no,
no.
i
don't
think
they're
equivalent.
i
say
that
vote
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
if
i
have
two
choices
available
to
me,
to
vote
yes
or
to
vote
no,
and
then
i
don't
vote,
then
you
can
make
a
reasonable
assumption
that
by
not
voting,
i
was
willing
to
let
the
other
people
who
did
vote
decide
the
case
for
me.
but
if
you
only
give
me
one
choice
and
then
you
say
to
me
at
the
same
time,
"by
not
voting,
you're
agreeing
to
what
the
fellows
who
are
voting
agree
to
and
also
voting
no
or
voting
against
that,"
then
you
have
this
--
this
contradiction.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
of
course
not,
your
honor,
because
what
it
says
is
you
don't
have
to
vote.
if
you
don't
want
to
vote
for
representation,
don't
vote,
but
then,
they
will
still
certify
based
on
the
majority
of
the
votes
that
are
cast
even
though
a
majority
has
not
voted
for
that
representative.
and
you
justify
that
in
the
first
instance
on
a
presumption
that
those
not
voting
have
agreed
and
advanced
an
ascent
to
that
choice.
there's
no
--
there's
simply
no
way
around
it.
you
come
up
that
not
voting
becomes
two
things,
assenting
for
the
role
of
the
majority
of
those
voting
and
voting
no,
and
it
can't
be
the
same
thing
at
one
time.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
no
sir.
i
--
here,
i
think
i
feel
a
little
more
affirmative
in
responding
that
i
think
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
switchmen's.
i
--
i
was
a
little
more
cautious
on
the
other
one.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
no,
but
leedom
versus
kyne,
sir,
said
that
if
a
--
if
the
--
an
agency
does
something
contrary
to
what
clear
term
of
the
act
that
you
will
strike
it
down.
you're
not
calling
it
review.
for
example,
if
the
mediation
board
here
was
to
have
a
vote
and
it
certified
the
union
that
it
got
the
fewer
votes
and
ignored
the
one
that
got
the
greater
number
of
votes,
i
don't
think
we
have
much
trouble,
and
so
you
could
strike
that
down,
you
wouldn't
worry
about
switchmen's.
mr.
stuart
bernstein
pardon
sir?
mr.
stuart
bernstein
no
sir,
i
don't.
i
think
it
needs
a
little
construction
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
pardon?
mr.
stuart
bernstein
well,
i
think
you
have
to
read
the
statute
--
excuse
me
sir,
i
think
you
have
to
read
the
--
the
statute
with
the
--
what
the
proponents
of
the
statute
said
when
they
adopted
--
when
they
said
the
employees
did
not
have
the
right
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
alright
sir,
i
--
mr.
stuart
bernstein
i
--
i
have
agreed
to
share
my
time
with
mr.
arguello
representing
the
employees.
thank
you
very
much.
