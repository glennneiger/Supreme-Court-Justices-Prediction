what
would
you
say
--
justice
arthur

--
the
union
involved
brought
in
signed
contract
by
majority
and
no
election
was
ever
held.
would
you
sat
any
of
your

[inaudible]
justice

do
you
really
think
it
isn't
equivalent
at
this
stage
united's
instruction
that
the
employees
could
not
be
simply
told,
don't
cast
the
ballot,
don't
take
a
ballot
or
if
you
do
one,
don't
mark
it
in
depositing,
do
you
think
that
there's
something

you
really
do?
justice
arthur

--
(voice

in
the
present
situation.
justice
arthur
j.

but
that
isn't
what
this
says.
this
is,
"if
less
than
majority
of
the
employees
cast
valid
ballots,
no
representative
will
be
certified".
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what's
unclear
about
this
statement
is
it
is
perfectly
clear.
it
says,
"if
less
than
a
majority
of
the
employees
cast
valid
ballots,
no
representative
will
be
certified."
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
this
court
permitted
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
court
permitted
a
less
prescriptive
test
and
the
board
has
now
imposed
upon
itself.
what's
wrong
with
that?
