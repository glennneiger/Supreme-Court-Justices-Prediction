justice
byron
r.
white
--
come
out
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
it
necessarily
to
follow
that
--
that
it's
not
someone
--
they
would
have
rights
to
be
heard
or
participate
in
the
hearing
instead
of
getting
this
a
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
would
be
the
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
because
--
is
this
because
you
the
rule
might
be
that
--
that
carrier
has
a
right
to
be
heard
by
the
board,
it
doesn't
mean
that
after
the
board
has
acted,
that
it
can
be
second
guessed
by
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
unless
--
unless
you
put
there's
going
to
be
a
judicial
review,
you
don't
need
to
talk
about
two
and
a
half
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
difference
between
you
being
a
party
and
a
witness
as
far
as
putting
the
fact
before
the
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
want
to
--
i
mean
if
you
want
to
cutoff
the
judicial
review
part
of
it
of
which
the
witness
couldn't
get,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
you're
a
party
or
a
witness?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
or
either?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
didn't
get
either
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
that
--
what
does
necessary
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
mean
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
what's
necessary
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
got
--
you've
got
to
qualify
what
you
just
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
maybe
that
--
that
maybe
the
board
is
holding
the
authority
where
there's
a
dispute,
but
what
is
it
--
is
it
still
your
position
that
the
board
may
disagree
with
every
union
that's
involved
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
unions
come
in
and
agree
that
--
that
the
unit
should
be
so
and
so,
or
the
craft
should
be
so
and
so,
then
you'd
say
the
board
still
has
the
authority.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
the
solicitor
general's
point
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i
thought
that
when
they
all
agree,
the
board
is
out
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
those
other
cases
we're
talking
about
where
they
agreed
to
--
where
they
agreed
to
have
a
narrower
unit.
now,
was
there
either
a
dispute
in
those
cases
to
what
the
unit
should
be
or
were
all
the
unions
agreeing
that
there
should
be
a
narrower
unit?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
(voice
overlap)
the
one
--
so
there
was
no
dispute
and
the
one
union
wanted
a
narrower
unit.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
and
the
board
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
--
it
did
overrule
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
overrule
the
other
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
union
involved.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
this
case
is
just
a
--
this
board
or
something
or
the
board
really
--
do
you
think
it
barred
the
policy
about
hearing
carriers?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
this
case?
had
they
been
making
--
hearing
carriers?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
still
they
quote
in
variables
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
for
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
that
here
is
the
one
instance
where
the
court
must
review
the
action
to
the
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather,
you'd
think
the
inscription
that
was
added
to
the
ballot
should
be
on
the
ballot
and
also
a
square
for
--
for
voting
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
they're
equivalent
in
that
regard?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
voting
and
voting
no
are
the
same
for
that
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
how
can
you
possibly
say
that
the
--
the
no
vote
square
would
serve
the
purpose
of
those
who
didn't
vote?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
then
the
--
that
the
inscription
they
have
added
to
the
ballot
doesn't
satisfy
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
that
argument
unless
you
attack
switchmen's
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
what
can
be
obtained
that
the
--
that
the
problem
we're
talking
about
didn't
happen
with
others
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
just
so
i
can
get
your
position
clearly,
you
say
that
its
not
only
the
practice
of
the
board
is
to
follow
what
the
union
say
when
there's
no
dispute
but
you,
you
go
further
and
say
that
the
board
is
duty-bound.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
between
that?
