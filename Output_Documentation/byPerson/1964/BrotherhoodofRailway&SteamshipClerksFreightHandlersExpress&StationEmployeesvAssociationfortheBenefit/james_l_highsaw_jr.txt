mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
because
of
the
time
limitations,
i
just
like
to
confine
myself
to
a
couple
of
points
that
had
been
raised
here.
one
is
the
amendments
to
the
railway
labor
act
which
brought
the
air
carrier
industry
under
that
act
where
enacted
on
april
10,
1936.
that's
section
201
of
railway
labor
act
which
is
45
u.s.c,
section
181.
the
civil
aviation
act
was
enacted
in
june
of
1938
and
became
effective
in
august
of
1938.
now
there
are
two
things
i
would
like
to
point
out
about
this.
one
is
that
congress
just
--
did
not
simply
extend
the
railway
labor
act
willy-nilly
to
air
carriers.
when
it
adopted
the
railway
labor
act
for
air
carriers
in
1936,
it
considered
all
of
the
various
provisions
and
it
did
in
fact
not
apply
section
3
which
is
the
grievance
procedures
to
air
carriers
that
set
up
--
separate
and
distinct
grievance
procedure
which
accorded
with
what
was
going
on
in
the
air
transport
industry.
also
when
the
civil
aeronautics
act
was
acted
in
1938,
the
congress
once
again
considered
the
relationship
of
the
railway
labor
act
to
civil
aviation
and
it
wrote
a
specific
provision
into
the
civil
aviation
act
which
was
continued
in
the
federal
aviation
act
of
1958,
401
(l),
which
makes
it
a
condition
of
holding
certificates
that
an
air
carrier
comply
with
the
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act.
on
this
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
your
honor
and
it
is
not
my
concept
that
the
national
mediation
board
would
be
bound
to
accept
that.
what
is
based
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
what
has
basically
happened
in
these
situations
is
that
the
so-called
agreements
have
fallen
within
the
craft
or
class
lines
that
the
mediation
board
has
laid
down
and
that's
exactly
and
precisely
what
happened
here.
it
fell
within
the
craft
lines
and
have
been
decided
by
the
mediation
board
and
if
there
were
minor
exceptions
to
that,
i
think
that
the
history
of
the
mediation
board
shows
that
it
has
accepted
it
but
i
would
it
would
be
my
opinion
that
if
two
unions
came
in
with
a
proposal
that
you're
suggesting,
the
mediation
board
would
set
it
down
for
hearings
and
conduct
a
very
full
hearing
before
it
changed
up
a
basic
craft
or
class
that
it
had.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
yes,
i
think
--
i
think
that's
the
way
i
interpret
your
honor.
i
don't
understand
that
the
solicitor
general
interprets
it
differently
but
that's
the
way
i
interpret
it.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
right.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
that's
right.
and
in
that
sense
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
oh!
yes,
your
honor
and
i've
got
to
be
in
a
hearing
monday
morning
in
los
angeles
where
a
union
is
trying
to
break
off
a
group
of
a
clap
--
craft
or
class
in
the
--
in
the
carrier.
but
this
--
these
are
--
these
are
situations
in
which
the
--
there's
a
variation
from
the
established
craft
or
class
which
the
board
has
set
up
when
two
unions
come
in
and
say,
"we
want
to
contest
for
representation
within
the
confinement
of
craft
or
class,"
the
board
ordinarily
accepts
it
as
i
understand
it.
now
also
on
this
question
of
evidence
on
what
the
board
had
before
it,
i
might
point
out
that
it's
my
understanding
of
the
regulations
that
35%
authorizations
are
required
if
a
particular
group
is
represented
--
is
not
represented,
and
51%
authorizations
if
it
is
represented.
and
in
this
case
of
course,
the
brotherhood
of
railway
and
steamship
clerks
submitted
to
the
mediation
board
the
requisite
number
of
cards
for
a
decision
to
be
made.
now
on
the
third
point,
i
would
like
to
make
simply
this
that
the
brotherhood
believes
that
if
the
position
of
the
carrier
and
of
abne
is
accepted
here
that
it
will
mean
that
the
purposes
of
the
statute
will
be
completely
defeated
because
the
statute
contemplates
and
specifically
adjures
the
board,
puts
the
command
on
the
board
to
decide
these
disputes,
representation
disputes
and
to
certify
representative
within
30
days.
in
this
particular
case,
we're
now
two-and-a-half
years
past
the
30
days
and
i
think
that
if
the
position
is
accepted
by
the
other
side
or
accepted
by
this
court,
it
will
mean
that
the
organizations
representing
employees
in
this
industry
will
be
more
and
more
confronted
with
this
type
of
situation.
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
no.
i
think
your
honor
what
it
does
it
greatly
extends
and
expands
the
field
and
the
scope
of
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
--
of
what
is
heretofore
been
considered
rights
and
i
think
it
will
and
it
will
encourage
lawsuits
just
as
you
have
a
lot
of
lawsuits
now
pending
i
understand
in
the
district
court
as
the
result
of
these
lawsuits.
you
--
you
encourage
by
expanding
the
field
of
judicial
review,
to
encourage
people
to
try
to
expand
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
well,
it
does
mean
your
honor
very
clearly
that
any
carrier
can
come
in
on
any
representation
dispute
and
demand
a
hearing
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
statutory
requirement
of
30
days
would
be
impossible
to
--
mr.
james
l.
highsaw,
jr.
well,
in
this
case
your
honor,
before
we
ever
got
to
the
point
of
judicial
review,
almost
nine
months
had
elapsed
in
this
situation
because
of
the
--
what
had
been
going
on
between
the
board
and
the
parties.
