was
that
after
or
before
the
hearing,
do
you
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
in
the
1936
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
is
based
on
the
constitutional
ground,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
don't
claim
the
statute
applies
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
process
this
further
--
a
hearing,
why
wouldn't
[inaudible]
judicial
review
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
most
of
the
hearings
are
based
on
based
on
that.
what
do
you
do
with
the
switchmen's
case
then
except
--
unless
you're
saying
that
the
switchmen's
case
ultimately
has
to
be
overruled.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
union
would
have
the
same
right,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
union
--
you
are
holding
that
the
constitution
requires
a
hearing
to
be
given
to
the
company
but
not
given
to
the
union?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
would
the
company
have
any
more
right
to
a
hearing
than
the
union?
justice
hugo
l.
black
constitutionally
speaking.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
how
if
you're
entitled
to
a
hearing
by
the
constitution.
we'll
go
in
and
say,
"you're
entitled
to
a
hearing
by
the
constitution,"
but
if
they
decide
it
wrong,
the
court
can't
set
it
aside.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
arbitrary
unreasonable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
can
always
be
alleged
and
you
got
to
look
all
of
it,
i
don't
see
why
--
maybe
it's
right,
it
should
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
don't
see
why
your
argument
doesn't
leave
the
fact
that
you're
hearing
to
each
side.
myself,
i
would
say
the
union
is
entitled
to
this
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
they
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
in
fact
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
constitutional
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
yours
is
a
constitutional
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we're
not
asking
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
about
the
overruling
of
switchmen's.
i'm
asking
that
based
on
the
puzzle
--
puzzle
within
my
mind,
why
ultimately
it's
been
[inaudible]
overruling
and
that
we
accept
your
argument.
justice

black
--
(voice

be
escaped.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
yet?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
all
you
have
now.
that's
all
you
have
here.
but
you
would
follow
that
we'd
look
at
it
and
see
as
you
say,
to
see
if
it's
an
arbitrary
procedure.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
saying
that's
not
a
wise
thing
or
a
good
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
a
constitutional
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
other
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
case
held
that
we
just
didn't
look
at
them
and
review
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
union
a
party?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
after
the
term
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
think
--
do
you
think
that
means
they
would
have
to
do
this
voting?
