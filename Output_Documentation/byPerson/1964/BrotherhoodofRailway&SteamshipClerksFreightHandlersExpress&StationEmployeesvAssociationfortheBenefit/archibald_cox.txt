mr.

cox
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
archibald

mr.
highsaw
and
i
agreed
to
divide
the
time
and
--
mr.
archibald

--
i
will
--
mr.
archibald

--
take
the
bulk
of
the
time
but
try
not
to
run
over
into
his
too
much
and
then
he
will
--
so
that
i
may
present
the
views
of
the
government
which
is
interested
in
these
cases.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
he
will
then
present
the
views
of
his
client,
the
brotherhood
of
railway
clerks.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
three
cases
which
are
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
raise
two
quite
distinct
questions
under
the
railway
labor
act.
the
first
concerns
the
form
of
a
ballot
to
be
used
in
an
election
which
the
board
proposed
to
conduct
among
certain
of
the
employees
of
the
united
air
lines.
and
the
second
question
concerns
the
alleged
or
claimed
right
of
a
carrier
to
be
heard
on
the
kind
of
question
of
representation
which
arose
in
this
case.
i
shall
consider
the
two
questions
quite
separately
because
they're
analytically
distinct
in
the
order
in
which
i
have
stated.
i
think
it
would
also
be
convenient
that
instead
of
simply
stating
the
facts
in
the
normal
manner,
i
were
to
explain
the
relevant
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act
as
i
go
along
and
the
state
of
facts
because
it
is
quite
different
from
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
we
normally
think
of
in
this
kind
of
case.
the
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act
that
are
relevant
are
set
out
beginning
on
page
3
of
our
brief.
on
page
4,
section
2
second
provides
that
all
disputes
between
a
carrier
and
its
--
or
carriers,
its
or
their
employees
shall
be
considered
between
representatives
designated
and
authorized
to
confirm
respectively
by
the
carrier
or
carriers
and
by
the
employees.
section
2
fourth
over
on
the
opposite
page,
provides
that
the
majority
of
any
craft
or
class
of
employees
shall
have
the
right
to
determine
who
shall
be
the
representatives
of
the
craft
or
class
for
the
purposes
of
the
checker.
and
then
section
2
sixth
provides
that
when
any
dispute
arises
between
a
carrier
and
its
employees,
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
designated
representative
or
representatives
of
such
carrier
and
of
such
employees,
referring
again
to
the
representatives
of
the
employees,
to
confer
and
respect
of
such
dispute.
you'll
note
that
throughout
the
statute,
it
speaks
in
terms
of
making
a
designation
and
almost
seems
to
assume
that
there
will
be
a
designation.
in
this
case,
in
1962
after
united
air
lines
had
acquired
capital
airline,
a
dispute
arose
as
to
who
were
the
representatives
of
a
class
of
employees
known
as
the
clerical,
office,
stores,
fleet
and
passenger
service
employees
or
rather
large
and
from
some
points
of
view,
heterogeneous
grouping.
some
employees
belonged
to
the
brotherhood
of
railway
clerks
which
is
the
petitioner
in
one
of
these
cases.
other
employees
had
been
represented
by
the
international
association
of
machinists.
section
2
ninth
of
the
statute
on
page
6
provides
for
that
problem.
if
a
dispute
shall
arise
among
a
carrier's
employees
as
to
who
are
the
representatives
of
such
employees
designated
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
this
chapter,
that
it's
the
duty
of
the
mediation
board
to
investigate
and
to
certify
the
name
or
names
of
the
individuals
or
organizations
that
had
been
designated.
and
then
further
on
it
has
provided
that
in
such
investigation,
the
mediation
board
shall
be
authorized
to
take
a
secret
ballot
of
the
employees
involved
or
to
utilize
any
other
appropriate
method
of
ascertaining
the
names
of
their
duly
designated
and
authorized
representatives.
in
this
case,
the
board
did
determine
to
take
the
ballot
and
it
proposed
to
use
a
form
of
ballot
which
it
had
used
in
thousands
of
elections
for
almost
30
years
and
the
form
of
ballot
that
had
been
used
by
the
united
states
railroad
labor
board
before
the
enactment
of
the
statute
which
was
of
course
an
example
the
precedent
before
the
congress
when
it
enacted
the
statute.
i
can
best
describe
the
conventional
form
of
ballot
by
referring
the
court
to
the
very
back
of
our
brief,
pages
64
and
65,
just
below
the
middle
of
page
64.
you'll
note
that
official
ballot;
it
begins
by
saying
a
dispute
exists
among
the
above
named
craft
or
class
of
employees,
on
the
ballot
in
this
case
would
appear
the
craft
as
i've
described
it,
as
to
who
are
the
representatives
of
such
employees,
designated
and
authorized
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
the
railway
labor
act.
that
language
is
taken
from
the
first
part
of
section
2
ninth
which
says
"where
there
is
such
a
dispute,
the
board
shall
do
certain
things",
and
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
board
says,
"there
is
such
a
dispute
and
where
you're
taking
a
secret
ballot
in
order
to
ascertain
and
to
certify
the
name
or
names
of
organizations
or
individuals
designated
and
authorized
for
the
purposes
of
the
act."
and
you'll
find
that
that
language
is
just
about
the
language
in
which
it
is
instructed
or
empowered
to
do
such
thing.
then
the
conventional
ballot
did
not
have
on
it
the
legion
instructions
for
voting
and
the
next
paragraph
of
my
brief,
a
put
a
large
circle
around
that,
we
come
back
to
it,
it's
important,
that
was
not
on
the
conventional
ballot.
the
conventional
ballot
having
said
we're
--
we're
directed
to
find
out
who
are
the
representatives
of
the
employees,
gathered
all
the
possible
representatives,
those
that
the
agency
knew
had
any
support
among
the
employees
and
asked
the
employees
if
you
desire
to
be
represented
by,
then
in
this
case
would
come
brotherhood
of
railway
steamship
clerks,
mark
an
x
in
this
square.
the
next
would
say
of
the
machinists,
if
you
desire
to
be
represented
by
the
machinists,
mark
an
x
in
this
square.
if
there
were
any
other
unions
as
thereof
denied,
there
would
be
a
similar
line
for
them.
and
then
always,
finally
the
line,
if
you
desire
to
be
represented
by
any
other
organization
or
individual,
write
the
name
on
the
line
below
and
mark
an
x.
occasionally
and
--
very
occasionally
but
occasionally,
an
individual
or
another
organization
is
written
in
and
does
quite
well.
you'll
note
that
neither
the
statute
nor
the
conventional
form
of
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
i
was
coming
to
pick
that
up
in
chronological
sequence.
you
will
note
that
neither
the
statute
nor
the
traditional
form
of
ballot,
says
anything
about
employees
opposed
to
all
elective
party.
the
railway
labor
act
guarantees
the
right
of
employees
of
the
majority
to
make
the
designation.
it
is
common
ground
that
there
is
no
compulsion
to
make
a
designation.
similarly,
the
form
of
ballot
traditionally
gave
employees
freedom
to
mark
any
organization
they
wanted
to
but
there
was
no
compulsion
to
mark
a
ballot,
to
vote
at
all,
you
could
return
a
blank
ballot
or
you
could
write
on
it
none
or
a
variety
of
other
things
at
that
time.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
could
and
of
course,
one
of
the
things
that
the
board
has
often
done
and
still
does
is
go
around
and
have
a
card
check
which
consists
of
going
to
the
various
employees
of
the
union
and
they
have
employees
mark
cards,
saying,
"i
designate
the
brotherhood
of
railway
clerk
represent
me"
and
the
board
sometimes
compares
the
signatures
on
those
cards
with
the
payroll
if
the
company's
agreeable
and
finds
the
answer
that
way.
the
board
has
it
varying,
of
course,
that's
the
essence
of
our
argument
that
the
board
has
the
widest
range
of
choice
in
carrying
out
this
function.
i
should
add
one
more
thing
about
the
traditional
practice.
the
board
has
always
made
no
designation
if
a
majority
of
the
employees
has
made
no
certification,
if
a
majority
of
the
employees
failed
to
make
a
designation,
it's
in
that
event
dismissed
the
proceeding
and
there
would
be
no
certified
representatives.
now
in
the
present
case,
united
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
i
guess
i
misled
you.
when
i
said
fail
to
make
a
designation,
i
meant
any
designation.
i
--
in
other
words,
if
a
majority
don't
ballot,
don't
designate
anybody
then
the
board
would
dismiss
the
proceeding.
now
the
case
i
think
your
honor
is
thinking
of
is
the
case
where
there
maybe
seven
or
eight
out
of
15
employees
make
what
i
meant
to
imply
by
a
designation,
but
they
designate
different
unions
and
then
there
are
say
seven
less
than
a
majority
who
don't
vote
at
all.
it
is
said
here
and
i
will
come
to
this
a
little
later,
it
is
said
that
in
that
event,
the
board
would
certify
the
union
that
had
a
majority
of
those
who
did
vote.
mr.
archibald
cox
whether
it
would
in
any
particular
circumstances
or
not,
i
think
it's
open
to
question.
the
language
and
the
opinion
in
this
court
in
the
virginian
railway's
case
to
the
effect
that
a
majority
of
those
who
don't
vote
delegate
to
those
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
who
do
the
right
to
make
a
choice,
has
never
been
so
far
as
i
can
find
out
or
the
board
could
find
out
for
me,
has
never
been
espoused
by
the
board
itself.
what
the
board
might
do
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
might
say,
"well,
out
of
the
15
employees,
eight
have
designated
a
union,"
that
shows
that
a
majority
of
the
employees
desire
collective
bargaining.
this
is
an
inference
that
often
has
been
drawn
by
labor
boards
from
that
kind
of
distribution
of
ballot.
mr.
archibald
cox
by
some
union.
and
then
it
might
say,
"well,
since
those
people
want
to
be
represented
by
some
union,
the
one
that
the
majority
wants
is
the
one
that
has
the
most
votes
of
them."
mr.
archibald
cox
of
the
eight,
so
that
would
reach
somewhat
the
result
that
you
suggest
but
not
on
the
reasoning
which
is
taken
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
virginian
railway's
case
nor
am
i
prepared
to
concede
that
the
board
would
do
such
a
thing.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
there
are
cases
where
it
has
--
oh,
i
know
there
are
cases
where
it
has
certified
the
union
which
had
the
majority
of
the
votes
cast.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
not
a
majority
of
all
the
employees.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
reasoning
--
i'm
not
--
it
usually
isn't
explicated.
it
doesn't
write
opinions
but
--
for
labor
relations
board,
in
addition,
i
think
that
to
some
extent,
what
it's
been
said
here
may
cause
the
board
to
have
to
rethink
some
of
this.
but
with
respect
to
that
case
since
we've
devoted
our
attention
to
it,
may
i
just
make
three
comments
now
and
then
i
won't
have
to
take
it
up
later
in
the
course
of
my
argument.
first,
as
the
case
has
put
to
the
united's
brief
because
that's
the
case
we're
talking
about,
it
assumes
that
those
who
vote
for
a
particular
union,
vote
for
that
union
and
no
other,
of
course
that
never
a
case.
that's
a
wholly
artificial
assumption.
it
maybe
true
or
it
may
not
be
true,
but
no
election
is
ever
been
held
that
brings
that
fact
out
and
most
observers
i
think
would
say
was
the
opposite
of
the
case.
second,
we
would
say
that
what
inferences
are
to
be
drawn
from
a
particular
distribution
of
the
ballot
is
most
clearly
something
left
to
the
board
and
i
will
develop
that
that
later
and
third
we
submit,
that
no
court
should
enjoin
the
holding
of
an
election,
tying
the
whole
thing
up
for
what
now
is
two
years,
it's
likely
to
be
two-and-a-half
minimum,
because
of
what
the
board
may
do
sometime
and
some
distribution
of
the
ballots
that
hasn't
ever
come
about
and
so
as
the
whole
thing,
it's
entirely
hypothetical
and
nobody
can
tell
how
it
will
come
about.
mr.
archibald
cox
then
the
board
dismisses
the
proceeding
--
mr.
archibald
cox
when
a
majority
do
not
vote
and
i
include
among
the
do
not
vote
spoiled
ballots
then
the
board
dismisses
the
proceeding.
that
is
its
practice,
attorney
general
clark,
mr.
justice
clark
when
he
was
attorney
general
said,
"you
don't
have
to",
but
the
board
said,
"we
still
think
we
ought
to"
and
it
has
continued
to
dismiss
it.
so
that
there
has
been
from
the
beginning,
a
way
in
which
employees
who
were
opposed
to
all
collective
bargaining
could
express
their
opposition.
now
in
this
case,
after
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
issued
an
injunction
staying
the
election
unless
the
board
put
a
box
on
the
ballot
for
"no
union,"
we
considered
the
problem.
i
had
some
grave
doubts
which
i
expressed
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
about
the
propriety
of
the
board's
practice.
what
bothers
me
was
that
i
didn't
think
that
the
employees
who
were
opposed
to
collective
bargaining
had
any
very
good
notice
that
this
was
the
way
to
express
themselves.
true
it's
in
the
board's
annual
reports,
but
i
doubt
that
many
employees
read
its
annual
report.
probably,
it
was
noised
about
in
this
case,
i'm
sure
it's
been
noised
widely
about,
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
that
was
the
board's
practice,
it
will
hold
to
say
so.
so
what
was
done
with
i
think
the
board's
full
support,
but
to
this
little
collective
bargaining
about
it,
threatened
back
perhaps
by
a
threat
to
strike,
they
put
on
the
ballot,
this
is
the
part
that
i
suggested
that
you
circle
earlier,
"instructions
for
voting."
no
employee
is
required
to
vote
if
less
than
a
majority
of
the
employees
cast
valid
ballots,
no
representative
will
be
certified.
now
that's
given
equal
prominence
with
everything
else.
it
comes
just
ahead
of
the
things
where
you
might
mark
the
choice
of
any
organization
and
i
should
think
no
employee
would
have
any
difficulty
concluding
what
it
meant.
now
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
i
suppose
in
terms
of
issuing
an
injunction,
that
is
always
proper,
isn't
it?
i
was
in
--
i
hope
i
was
right.
i
was
in
a
little
bit
of
a
dilemma.
it
seemed
to
me
what
the
board
was
doing
wasn't
fair
and
there
are
a
lot
of
other
elections
going
on
and
i
recognize
that
i
was
changing
the
circumstances
before
the
court,
but
i
thought
where
it
was
an
ongoing
administrative
proceeding.
i
would
think
technically
justice
stewart
that
one
met
the
problem
that
the
facts
had
been
changed,
if
this
is
an
equity
case,
i
suppose
we're
liable
to
being
enjoined
from
conducting
the
election
unless
we
use
this
form
of
ballot.
this
court
could
change
the
relief
a
little
bit
in
the
light
of
changed
circumstances.
what
we're
saying
in
effect
i
guess
is,
we
have
no
objection
to
an
injunction
which
would
forbid
the
holding
of
the
election
--
mr.
archibald
cox
unless
these
form
of
ballot
were
used.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
was
--
what
i
meant
was
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no.
they're
not
in
any
way
--
they
learned
about
it
after
the
mediation
board
changed
its
rule.
there
was
no
consultation.
i
don't
think
they
like
it
any
better
than
the
proceeding
one.
mr.
archibald
cox
substantially.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
there
are
three
reasons.
i
did
say
it's
substantial.
i
don't
think
it's
exactly
the
same.
there
are
some
people
who
think
it's
exactly
the
same.
there
are
others
who
think
it
is.
the
three
reasons
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
board
has
three
reasons
for
using
this
form
of
ballot.
the
first
is
that
this
is
the
form,
except
for
the
new
instruction,
this
is
the
form
of
ballot
literally
that
has
been
used
since
the
year
1920.
that
includes
the
period
under
the
united
states
railroad
labor
board
which
preceded
the
enactment
of
the
railway
labor
act
from
the
34
amendments
which
was
the
model
and
which
--
and
then
the
entire
period
from
34
to
to
date
thousands
of
elections.
and
there
is
unnatural
reluctance
to
upset
something
that's
been
used
during
that
period
with,
so
far
as
anyone
knows,
a
complete
success.
second,
in
many,
i
would
guess
in
most
of
the
elections
conducted
by
the
mediation
board,
the
only
substantial
question
is
in
fact,
who
are
the
representatives
of
the
employees?
there
isn't
going
to
be
a
no
union
board.
that's
true
in
nearly
all
their
railroad
elections.
it
is
true
in
a
good
many
of
the
airline
elections
and
this
form
of
ballot
does,
in
a
way,
concentrate
attention
upon
the
question
which
really
has
to
be
decided
by
the
proceeding.
then
the
third
reason
is
this.
the
present
form
of
ballot,
we
think,
does
accurately
reflect
the
words
and
policies
of
the
act.
i
don't
think
that
this
act
is
entirely
neutral
about
whether
there
is
going
to
be
a
designation
of
representatives.
the
aim
of
this
act
was
to
encourage
the
designation
of
representative,
possibly
even
to
require
it,
but
we
make
no
such
argument
here.
that
is
historically
one
of
the
views
that
has
been
taken
of
the
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right!
mr.
archibald
cox
this
act
was
--
this
act
bargained
out.
now,
it
is
very
difficult
to
state,
for
me
to
state
or
for
me
even
to
be
sure
in
my
own
mind,
just
how
far
this
act
goes
in
terms
of
encouraging
collective
bargaining
or
how
far
this
ballot
goes
in
terms
of
encouraging
collective
bargaining.
some
of
the
people
who've
i
consulted
on
the
mediation
board
think
that
this
is
completely
neutral.
my
own
opinion
and
i
suspect
this
because
i
sort
of
grew
up
with
the
national
labor
relations
act,
that
it
isn't
completely
neutral.
but
what
we
do
say
is
that
it
faithfully
reflects
exactly
the
attitude
of
the
statute
itself
and
it
--
therefore,
the
board,
we
would
argue
was
right
in
doing
it.
it
sort
of
encouraged
me
this
morning,
it's
sort
of
like
you
can
take
a
particular
color
and
you
can
debate
about
whether
it's
more
one
color
than
another
abstractly,
but
if
you
put
the
identical
thing
right
up
next
to
it,
you
can
say
the
two
were
the
same
and
we
say
that
this
form
of
ballot
thus
accurately
reflect
the
provisions,
almost
verbatim,
the
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act.
now
of
course,
our
--
those
are
the
reasons
mr.
justice
brennan
for
the
boards
position
and
if
it
made
this
change,
because
it's
quite
a
bit
of
argument
i
understand
if
it
made
a
more
radical
change
you
can
imagine
all
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
is
also
--
it
also
--
no,
i
didn't
quite
mean
it
that
way.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
an
interpretation
that
has
been
written
on
the
law.
there
is
a
policy
of
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
quieting
things
and
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
right.
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
real
point
we
stand
on
--
i'm
not
going
to
argue
that
any
further.
the
real
point
we
stand
on
is
that
the
question
is
one
for
the
mediation
board
to
decide.
i
don't
have
to
convince
you
that
this
was
a
wise
thing
to
do
we
say.
we
say
that
the
role
of
the
switchmen's
case
is
dispositive,
that
the
court
held
in
the
switchmen's
case
that
the
intent
of
section
2
ninth
is
plain.
the
dispute
was
to
reach
its
last
terminal
point
when
the
administrative
finding
was
made.
there
was
to
be
no
dragging
out
of
the
controversy
and
other
tribunals
of
law.
now
if
there
is
any
exception
to
that
rule,
applicable
to
the
national
mediation
board,
surely,
it's
no
broader
than
the
exception
made
in
leedom
and
kyne
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
cases.
and
there
the
court
said
that
it
would
interfere
only
if
the
board
had
acted
in
excess
of
its
delegated
powers
and
contrary
to
a
specific
provision
--
specific
prohibition
in
the
act.
but
now
certainly,
this
board
was
not
acting
in
excess
of
its
delegated
power.
it
was
told
to
find
who
were
the
representatives
and
it
was
trying
to
find
that
out.
nor
can
it
be
said
here
that
the
mediation
board
violated
any
specific
prohibition
of
the
act,
there's
no
specific
prohibition
against
using
this
form
of
ballot,
a
well-known
form
of
ballot
at
the
time
the
act
was
enacted.
indeed,
we
think
if
i
may
turn
back
to
the
statute
that
the
words
of
section
2
ninth
make
it
abundantly
clear
that
final
authority
to
decide
questions
concerning
the
form
of
the
ballot
is
vested
in
the
mediation
board.
it
begins
you'll
recall,
2
ninth,
that
the
dispute
shall
arise
and
so
forth,
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
mediation
board
to
investigate
and
certify
the
names
of
the
representative.
it
shall
be
the
duty.
that
is
the
only
mandatory
language
in
section
2
ninth.
down
toward
the
bottom
of
the
page,
it
says,
"in
such
an
investigation,
the
board
shall
be
authorized
to
take
a
secret
ballot
of
the
employees
involved
or
to
utilize
any
other
appropriate
method.
there's
no
compulsion
to
take
a
ballot
and
certainly,
there
is
nothing
said
about
the
form
of
the
ballot.
and
little
further
on,
the
statute
says,
the
board
shall
establish
the
rules
to
govern
the
election
and
it
would
seem
to
us
that
the
--
choosing
the
form
of
ballot
and
deciding
what
will
go
on
the
ballot
is
one
of
the
rules
to
govern
the
conduct
of
the
election.
the
legislative
history
we
think,
quite
clearly
supports
this
view.
first,
i've
mentioned
before
that
this
form
of
ballot
was
well-known
during
the
1920's
under
the
railway
labor
board.
second,
when
commissioner
eastman
who
of
course
was
one
of
the
leading,
the
leading
public
draftsman
of
the
act,
was
asked
various
questions
such
as
the
kind
of
question
that
justice
stewart
and
i
were
discussing
about
certifying,
where
the
votes
are
divided,
he
replied,
"well,
all
that
will
be
for
the
mediation
board."
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
your
honor
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
overstates
--
mr.
archibald
cox
some
time
in
that,
yes.
i
think
your
honor
somewhat
overstates
the
degree
of
organization
as
applied
to
a
certain
number
of
railroads.
it
is
--
it's
true
of
many
of
them,
but
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
say
there
were
no
possibility
of
unorganized
groups
or
of
an
unorganized
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
railway
systems.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
the
congress
did
choose
to
make
this
statute
with
all
its
fixed
ways
applicable
to
the
airline
industry.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
was
the
congressional
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
decision.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right.
and
then
congress
extended
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
extended
it
we
would
say
with
all
its
interpretation,
rubrics
written
upon
it
nor
does
it
seem
to
me
that
it's
quite
narrow
range
of
the
degree
to
which
this
will
influence
the
election
nor
does
it
seem
to
me
that
it
did
many
unreasonable
fashion.
now
united's
argument
here
is
that
the
ballot
contravenes
the
provisions
of
section
2
fourth
which
i
mentioned
before.
the
majority
of
any
craft
or
class
of
employees
shall
have
the
right
to
determine
who
shall
be
the
representatives
of
the
craft
or
class.
i
don't
quite
say
how
that
can
be
read
as
a
specific
prohibition
against
this
form
of
ballot.
nor
do
i
say,
how
giving
all
the
employees
the
right
to
mark
on
the
ballot
which
of
the
putative
organizations
they
desire
to
designate
and
telling
them
right
before
that
that
they
don't
need
to
designate
anyone,
how
that
can
be
said
to
interfere
with
the
right
of
the
majority
to
designate
the
craft
or
class.
the
whole
of
united's
argument
rests
upon
the
hypothetical
example
that
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
were
discussing
earlier.
as
i
suggested,
one
it
assumes
an
artificial
set
of
facts,
two,
it
calls
upon
the
court
to
intrude
into
what
would
be
peculiar
in
laying
inference
to
be
drawn
by
the
mediation
board
and
three,
it's
all
hypothetical
anyway.
we
haven't
gotten
anywhere
near
that
stage
of
the
proceeding.
the
argument
for
abne
is
much
the
same.
abne
says,
essentially,
well
it
doesn't
make
this
form
of
ballot
is
clear
enough
or
that
it
tips
the
scales
too
much
in
favor
of
designation.
i
submit
simply
in
concluding
this
point
that
both
the
question
of
how
much
this
tips
the
scales
if
it
all,
and
the
question
of
what
is
the
policy
of
the
act
in
that
regard
are
questions
which
under
the
switchmen's
case
and
under
leedom
and
kyne
and
indeed
under
settled
administrative
law,
are
questions
for
the
agency
to
determine.
i
come
now
to
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
rely
on
its
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
rely
on
its
accepting
switchmen.
i
don't
say
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
affirmatively
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
and
authority
for
me.
i
say
that
the
exception
it
carves
out
is
not
broad
enough
for
this
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
i'm
afraid
i
spoke
too
quickly.
i
come
now
to
the
second
question
in
the
case
which
is
whether
the
mediation
board's
order
directing
an
election
is
invalid
because
the
employer,
united
air
lines
and
abne,
the
employees
who
don't
want
collective
bargaining,
were
denied
a
hearing
upon
the
group,
the
craft
or
class
in
which
the
election
was
to
be
conducted.
the
material
facts
are
very
simple.
in
1947,
the
mediation
board
held
broad
hearings
on
the
crafts
or
classes
in
the
airline
industry
and
it
determined
partly
in
response
to
united
airline's
urges
that
--
and
appropriate
craft
or
class
would
be
clerical
office
stores,
fleet
and
passenger
service
employees,
the
group
involved
here.
in
this
case
after
the
merger,
for
time
there
was
a
dispute
between
the
machinists
and
the
clerks
about
what
was
the
appropriate
craft
or
class.
but
ultimately,
they
agreed
upon
the
clerical
office
stores,
fleet
and
passenger
service
employees.
and
the
board
said
it
would
hold
the
election
in
that
group.
united
and
then
a
little
later
in
the
faithful
abne
that
always
comes
along
two
steps
behind,
protested
and
then
took
the
issue
to
the
court
below.
the
board
of
course
rejected
the
protest.
neither
the
court
below
ruled
upon
this
question
or
at
least
not
explicitly
you
can
find
ruling
and
dismissing
the
complaint,
i
don't
know.
now
we
submit
that
neither
united
nor
abne
was
entitled
to
a
hearing.
the
question,
and
i
want
to
make
this
very
plain,
the
question
is
not
one
of
standing
of
administrative
procedure,
constitutional
due
process
in
the
procedural
sense.
the
question
is
one
of
substantive
law.
our
position
is
that
the
objection
of
united
and
abne
with
respect
to
the
group
to
be
voted
in
the
election
raised
no
substantive
issue
on
which
they
were
entitled
to
a
hearing
because
the
railway
labor
act
gives
the
employees
wishing
to
organize,
in
other
words,
those
for
whom
the
union
speaks,
the
right
to
agree
upon
in
the
craft
or
class
in
which
they
will
be
represented
as
they
did
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes,
yes
--
leaving
nothing
for
the
mediation
board
to
decide
except
which
union
if
any
is
the
representative.
this
is
the
view
taken
in
our
brief.
unfortunately,
i
did
not
put
it
in
a
larger
context
in
the
brief
and
this
left
some
of
my
statements
open
to
contradiction
which
is
a
contradiction
in
the
generalizations,
but
i
think
not
really
a
contradiction
when
one
understands
what
the
mediation
board's
view
has
been.
so
what
i
propose
to
do
is
to
explain
the
mediation
board's
view
of
the
matter
and
then
mr.
justice
stewart
argue
from
the
statute
wide
it
is
right.
under
the
railway
labor
act,
there
are
at
least
three
or
perhaps
more,
i
couldn't
think
of
them
all
to
begin
with,
now
i
think
of
three
kinds
of
questions
that
may
arise
with
respect
to
the
bargaining
unit
or
the
election
unit,
only
one
of
which
was
involved
in
this
case.
one
question
is
whether
all
the
employees
that
the
union
seeks
to
include
in
the
unit
are
in
fact
employees
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
sometimes
they
seek
to
include
people
who
are
managerial
--
in
that
--
where
that
issue
arises
where
the
claim
is
that
someone
is
being
included
that
isn't
an
employee,
then
the
mediation
board
recognizes
the
right
of
the
employer
to
be
a
party
and
to
be
heard.
and
three
of
the
cases
cited
in
united's
brief
fall
in
that
category.
then
there
is
i
think
analytically
a
second
type
of
question
that
may
possibly
arise
and
that
is
whether
the
unit
in
which
the
employee
is
seeking
to
organize
--
are
seeking
to
organize
is
a
craft
or
class,
is
a
permissible
craft
or
class
or
whether
it
isn't
a
craft
or
class
at
all.
that
question
is
not
possibly
and
never
was
involved
here.
the
board
had
decided
in
1947
that
this
was
a
permissible
craft
or
class.
it
was
a
recognized
craft
or
class
on
a
number
of
airline
systems
and
i
don't
--
i'm
sure
the
board
had
no
question
about
that
at
all.
then
the
third
problem
since
craft
or
class
is
a
very
loose
grouping,
is,
which
of
the
potential
crafts
or
classes
--
in
which
of
the
potential
crafts
or
classes
shall
the
employees
organize
or
shall
any
election
be
conducted
if
there
is
need
of
one,
and
shall
the
employees
be
represented
in
collective
bargaining.
it's
that
question
and
only
that
question
as
i
see
it
that
united
and
abne
sought
to
be
heard
on
or
really
sought
to
raise,
in
any
substantial
sense,
before
the
mediation
board.
now
our
position
is
as
i
said
a
moment
ago
that
with
respect
to
that
last
question,
the
railway
labor
board
gives
the
employees
speaking
through
their
unions,
the
right
to
decide
the
crafts
or
class
in
which
they
will
organize
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining.
mr.
archibald
cox
what
gives
the
union
speaking
for
the
employees?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
assumes
--
it
assumes
that
there
are
some
who
have
designated
the
union,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
evidence
that
the
employees
wishing
to
organize
decided
upon
them
was
the
statements
of
the
two
labor
organizations.
i've
never
said
that
all
the
employees
have
the
right
to
decide
in
the
craft
or
class.
i
said
that
those
wishing
to
organize
had
the
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
may
i
just
say
one
more
word
about
practice
before
i
come
to
this
point
because
otherwise,
i
will
get
--
i
will
come
to
it.
i'll
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
may
i
say
one
more
word
[attempt
to
laughter]
about
the
practice
and
then
come
to
it.
i
did
want
to
make
it
clear
that
where
the
two
unions
are
in
disagreement,
i'll
speak
of
the
unions
for
the
present,
mr.
justice
stewart,
where
the
two
unions
are
in
agreement
on
the
craft
or
class,
there's
nothing
to
be
decided.
where
they
are
in
disagreement
as
to
which
of
the
crafts
or
classes
shall
be
the
one
in
which
the
employees
are
represented,
then
of
course
the
mediation
board
has
to
resolve
the
question.
now
what
i
wanted
to
bring
out
was
simply
that
where
there
is
a
dispute
between
the
two
unions,
then
the
mediation
board
frequently
invites
the
employer
to
be
present
and
to
give
any
facts
it
has
in
it
possession,
to
give
any
opinion
it
wishes
to
give,
but
it
is
there
as
it
were
as
a
witness.
it
is
never
admitted
as
a
party
and
that
is
clearly
stated
in
the
board's
opinions.
now
in
this
case,
the
two
unions
were
in
agreement
so
if
we
are
right
--
if
right
on
the
substantive
issue
on
my
interpretation,
then
there
was
no
issue
for
the
board
to
decide,
no
occasion
to
invite
the
employer
or
anyone
else
to
give
expert
opinion.
now
why
do
i
say
what
i'd
do
about
the
statute,
which
is
the
heart
of
the
thing
once
one
gets
down
to
it.
we
point
out
first
the
provisions
of
section
2
fifth
which
says,
the
majority
of
any
craft
or
class
of
employees
shall
have
the
right
to
determine
who
shall
be
the
representatives
of
the
craft
or
class,
the
majority
of
any
craft
or
class.
our
view
is
that
that
gives
employees
who
say,
"we
want
to
bargain
collectively",
the
right
to
come
in
and
say,
"we
want
to
represent
this
group".
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true.
but
if
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
don't
think
that
it
could
be
disputed
that
the
theory
of
the
act
and
indeed
the
theory
of
most
labor
law
has
been
that
the
union
has
the
right
at
least
to
speak
for
those
employees
who
are
its
members
and
who
--
who
have
been
organized
prior
to
the
election.
now
suppose,
if
may
take
the
one
first,
i
don't
want
to
get
lost
in
unrelated
hypotheticals,
but
i
do
think
it's
pertinent.
i
--
suppose
that
the
steamship
clerks
should
come
in
and
said
"we
claim
to
be
the
representatives
among
this
class"
and
the
board
might
have
said,
it
may
say,
"well,
we
don't
know
whether
you're
a
majority
or
not,"
but
we
submit
--
but
it
does
speak
for
some
employees,
it
wouldn't
be
there
if
it
didn't
speak
for
some
employees.
and
those
that
it
is
speaking
for,
say,
"we
want
to
represent
this
group".
and
i
say
that
if
that
is
a
craft
or
class,
the
statute
says
that
a
majority,
if
it
has
one,
in
any
craft
or
class
has
the
right
to
designate
the
unit.
now
an
election
must
be
held
to
determine
whether
it
speaks
for
a
majority
in
that
craft
or
class,
i
agree.
but
it
comes
in
the
first
instance
and
says,
"well,
this
is
the
craft
or
class
in
which
we
claim
to
be
a
majority",
and
if
it
is
a
craft
or
class,
there
is
nothing
more
for
the
mediation
board
to
do
except
to
find
out
whether
it
is
a
majority
because
if
it
is,
then
it
is
their
representative,
the
majority
of
any
craft
or
class
have
a
right
to
designate.
now
if
you
add
one
more
union,
they
are
in
agreement
as
to
which
group
it
is
and
if
either
of
them
has
a
majority
in
that
group,
into
that
craft
or
class,
it
has
the
right
to
represent
them
and
the
only
thing
left
to
find
out
is
whether
there
is
indeed
a
majority.
mr.
archibald
cox
now
let
me
call
your
attention
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
the
same
--
i
believe
it's
the
same
30%.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
so,
the
board
will
go
ahead
with
the
procedure
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct,
yes.
i
appreciate
your
honor
calling
my
attention
to
that.
i
want
to
call
attention
in
this
connection
to
section
1
fifth
on
page
3
of
our
brief
where
the
term
"employee"
is
defined
and
then
the
proviso
reads,
provided
that
no
occupational
classification
made
by
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
shall
be
construed
to
define
the
crafts
according
to
which
railway
employees
maybe
organized
by
their
voluntary
action
and
testifying
about
that
provision,
mr.
harrison
who
is
one
of
the
leading
witness
i
should
think
for
the
railway
labor
unions
in
the
proceeding,
stated
very
clearly
that
the
purpose
was
to
give
employees,
we
cite
and
quote
it
in
our
brief,
the
right
to
choose
their
own
crafts
or
class.
in
other
words,
while
we've
become
familiar
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
we're
thinking
of
the
appropriate
bargaining
unit
as
something
the
board
sends
up
that
there's
a
public
interest
in
and
an
employer
interest
in.
this
statute
was
drawn
on
the
older
and
i
think
possibly
wiser
role
that
the
choice
of
the
unit
in
which
you
would
organize
was
just
as
much
a
matter
of
self-organization
as
the
choice
of
the
representative
of
the
union
itself
and
that
it
was
not
for
the
government
or
anyone
else
to
say
that
there
will
be
an
industrial
unit
or
there
will
be
a
craft
unit,
but
that
was
up
to
the
employees.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
there
have
been
a
great
--
mr.
archibald
cox
there
have
been
great,
many
craft
or
class
controversies
on
the
railroads
and
they're
continuing
to
be.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
have
to
agree,
it
was
more
stratified,
but
on
that
to
say
that
this
was
something
which
hadn't
or
couldn't
give
rise
to
dispute
or
that
people
overlooked
the
possibilities
of
dispute,
i
don't
think
history
would
bear
that
out
with
all
respect.
it
was
older
of
course
but
not
--
not
that
so.
now
i
don't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
in
the
late
1930s.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
haven't
looked
into
the
hearings.
i
think
it
must
have
been
but
i
haven't
looked
into
the
hearings.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
about
that
time,
yes.
it
was
the
late
30's,
justice
black.
i
was
sure
justice
stewart
is
right
but
all
i
can
say
it
was
the
late
30's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
late
1930s.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes,
that's
true.
but
--
for
whatever
it
was
worth,
they
did
take
the
statute.
now
the
--
i've
taken
much
of
the
time.
i
meant
to
leave
mr.
highsaw.
may
i
simply
say
two
things
more?
one
is
if
you
will
read
the
provisions
of
section
2
ninth
again
with
care,
you
will
see
that
they
very
plainly
treat
the
carrier
as
not
a
party
to
a
proceeding
under
section
2
ninth
although
the
board
has
in
these
exceptional
cases
where
a
quasi
jurisdictional
issue
was
raised,
brought
them
in
and
it
sometimes
has
asked
them
to
come
in
and
give
facts
that
would
help.
but
the
board
has
never,
in
this
kind
of
case
where
the
two
unions
were
in
agreement
in
its
entire
history,
allowed
the
carrier
by
its
position
on
the
craft
or
class
to
create
a
dispute.
the
record
is
perfectly
consistent
about
that.
now,
the
other
thing
that
i
wanted
to
emphasize
was
that
this
was
not
a
matter
of
chance.
you
will
see
from
our
brief
that
it
was
a
matter
of
deliberate
policy
because
it
was
felt
that
carrier
participation
in
the
elections
during
the
1920s
had
been
one
of
the
things
that
interfered
with
the
whole
freedom
of
choice
and
that
is
all
spend
out
--
spelled
out
in
the
hearing.
mr.
highsaw
will
take
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i'd
say
--
i
meant
to
say
and
i
can
put
it
in
a
phrase,
i
meant
to
say
on
every
occasion
the
employee
is
seeking
to
organize,
those
wishing
to
organize
choose
the
group
which
the
--
in
which
--
identify
the
group
in
which
they
claim
to
be
their
representatives.
they
identify
the
group
in
which
they
claim
to
be
the
representatives
and
then
you
find
out
whether
the
group
which
they've
identified
if
it
is
a
craft
or
class
and
that
wasn't
debatable
here,
whether
they
really
are
representative
of
a
majority.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
be
very
brief;
just
a
few
points
with
respect
to
craft
or
class
that
i
think
i
should
address
myself
to.
first,
there
is
apparently
a
difference
between
mr.
highsaw
and
myself
on
reading
the
statute.
and
i
recognize
his
connection
with
the
world
of
railway
labor
which
is
to
some
extent
is
strange
to
me.
on
the
other
hand,
the
position
we
put
forward
and
despite
some
unfortunate
words
on
page
60,
i
think
we
put
it
forward
quite
consistently
in
our
briefs,
is
that
where
the
two
unions
are
agreed
and
there
is
a
something
that
can
be
called
a
craft
or
class
then
there
is
no
question
before
the
board
and
that
is
my
understanding
of
the
board's
present
view
which
has
been
over
our
brief
and
so
forth.
and
we
think
that
occurred
particularly
with
the
spirit
indicated
in
section
1
fifth
of
the
act
on
page
3
which
i'd
particularly
emphasize
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
proviso
which
after
referring
to
employees
in
certain
occupational
classifications
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
goes
on
and
says
that
no
occupational
classification
made
by
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
no
shall
--
none
shall
be
construed
to
define
the
crafts
according
to
which
railway
employees
maybe
organized
by
their
voluntary
action
or
shall
the
jurisdictional
powers
of
such
employee
organizations
be
in
any
way
regarded
as
limited
or
modified
by
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
or
the
orders
of
the
commission.
i
think
that
reflects
the
philosophy
that
i
was
trying
to
explain
and
i
would
call
in
particular
your
attention
to
page
56
of
our
brief
where
we
quote
from
mr.
harrison's
testimony,
speaking
for
the
railway
labor
organizations
where
he
described
the
proviso
as
something
which
gave
organizations
of
employees
absolute
freedom
under
this
bill
to
determine
and
define
the
crafts
and
that's
where
they
agree,
we
say
is
conclusive
everywhere.
now
the
mediation
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
if
you
look
and
i'm
sure
you
will
in
the
brief,
if
you
find
the
one
union
cases,
there
are
four
of
them,
are
not
at
all
this
case.
three
of
them
including
the
northeast
airlines
case,
very
clearly
were
cases
involving
the
matter
of
where
these
employees
subject
to
the
act.
in
fact,
in
the
northeast
airlines
case,
the
carrier's
contention
as
the
board
summarized
it
was,
all
these
employees
are
in
fact
supervisors
of
supervisors,
therefore,
they
are
neither
subordinate
officials
nor
employees
subject
to
the
act.
now
there
is
one
case
as
we
read
them
justice
white,
involving
american
airlines
if
my
notes
are
correct,
in
which
a
dispute
broke
out
which
was
essentially
over
the
provisions
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
one
union
and
the
carrier
and
the
dispute
was
over
its
scope
and
the
board
did,
the
thing
dragged
along
and
it
couldn't
get
resolved
and
the
board
finally
agreed
that
it
would
hear
it
under
section
2
ninth.
it
wasn't
determining
who
are
representatives
in
the
sense
of
resolving
a
contest.
it
was
interpreting
the
contract.
i
don't
think
it
was
properly,
strictly
speaking
a
2
ninth
case
at
all,
but
if
it
was,
the
employer
had
a
different
kind
of
right
there.
he
had
acontract
and
he
was
standing
up
for
his
interpretation
of
the
contract.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
impending
case
as
i
understand
it,
there
are
two
unions
and
they
are
taking
conflicting
positions.
in
all
the
cases
that
we
read
from
here
including
this
case
where
our
brief
in
opposition
was
quoted
for
the
language
that
the
board
has
a
duty,
there
were
cases
where
there
were
two
unions
taking
different
positions
as
to
the
craft
or
class.
and
there's
no
question
that
the
board
has
the
duty
in
those
cases.
i
can
illustrate
this
best
by
taking
page
37
of
the
brief
where,
united's
brief,
where
they
quote
from
an
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
saying,
under
the
railway
labor
act,
only
the
national
mediation
board
has
the
power
to
make
craft
or
class
determination.
that
was
a
dispute
between
two
unions.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
preceding
sentence
was
one
which
said,
the
court
did
not
err
when
it
dismissed
the
complaint
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
under
the
railway
labor
act,
only
the
mediation
board.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
board's
practice
when
it
wanted
to
get
information
from
him
has
been
to
invite
him
to
participate.
i
deny
that
he
is
a
proper
party.
i
think
one
--
2
five
are
clearly
makes
him
not
a
proper
party.
i
would
prefer
to
reserve
judgment
as
to
whether
he
has
any
right
to
be
considered
to
be
invited
where
the
board
is
exercising
its
duty
because
that
isn't
our
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
unions
are
parties,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
unions
are
made
party
by
the
statute.
the
statute
refers
to
the
unions
as
party
and
it
refers
to
carrier
in
apposition
to
a
party.
if
you
read
2
ninth
carefully,
you'll
see
that
they
have
spoken
of
it
quite
different
--
quite
different
terms.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
any
union
having
an
interest
would
have
to
be
heard
and
the
reason
i
say
the
carrier
is
not
entitled
to
be
heard
in
this
case
because
i
think
there's
no
open
substantive
issue.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
the
way
i
read
the
statute,
provided
--
with
only
one
classification
and
it's
very
slight
--
i
think
this
does
have
to
be
a
cognizable
craft
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
or
class,
yes.
