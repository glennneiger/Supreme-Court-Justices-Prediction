mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
yes
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
matthew
mccann
and
i'm
a
lawyer
in
worcester,
massachusetts,
and
i
represent
the
defendant
in
this
action,
mr.
giacomo
ventresca.
very
briefly
so
that
you
will
know
what
happened
here,
i
have
a
trial
practice
and
this
man
was
referred
to
me
for
purposes
of
handling
his
trial.
he
was
arrested
for
possession
of
an
illegal
distill
in
the
home
or
rather
in
a
cellar
of
his
house
at
148
1/2
coburn
avenue.
that
house
is
a
couple
of
miles
from
where
my
office
is
located
and
what
happened
here
was
that
a
search
warrant
was
sought
for
on
august
30,
1961
to
search
the
house.
that
affidavit
--
that
a
search
warrant
was
bottomed
on
an
affidavit,
which
is
the
principal
issue
or
the
central
issue
in
this
case.
on
september
1,
the
search
was
made
and
the
distill
was
seized
in
the
cellar
of
the
house.
it
was
done
about
quarter
of
nine
in
the
morning.
mr.
ventresca
and
his
wife
and
family
were
still
in
their
pajamas.
the
federal
officers
entered
under
authority
of
the
search
warrant,
went
into
the
cellar,
seized
and
apprehended
distill
and
destroyed
the
contraband
they
found
there.
and
quite
collaterally
went
up
to
the
second
floor
and
rifled
the
contents
of
the
bureau
drawer
and
the
top
of
the
bureau
and
took
the
wallet
out
of
the
man's
pants
pocket,
which
were
hanging
on
the
closet
door
and
alike
and
so,
i
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
and
have
it
returned.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
that
was
returned.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
that
was
returned.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
no
longer
in
the
case.
so
that
those
extraneous
matters
–
items,
which
should
not
have
been
seized,
matters
of
evidence
rather
than
matters
of
crime
were
returned,
but
i
lost
the
motion
hearing
on
the
matter
of
the
hearsay
affidavit,
which
i
thought
it
to
be
and
the
case
proceeded
to
trial.
i
tried
the
case
in
the
federal
district
court
of
boston
and
i
lost
it
and
the
man
was
given
a
jail
sentence
and
a
fine.
i
took
an
appeal
to
the
circuit
court
for
the
first
circuit.
and
the
three
court,
three-judge
bench
sustained
my
appeal
and
reversed
the
sentence,
reversed
the
judgment
on
a
split
decision
two
to
one.
judge
hartigan
deciding
in
the
favor
of
the
defendant.
judge
woodbury
filed
a
dissent
and
judge
aldrich
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
which
really
--
when
you
read
it
was
more
of
a
dissent
to
the
dissent.
then
the
government
requested
and
was
granted
certiorari
and
we
are
now
here.
now,
the
affidavit
was
looked
at
yesterday,
but
since
it
is
the
central
issue
in
the
case,
i
think
it
would
be
well
to
start
off
today
again
simply
by
looking
at
the
two
key
paragraphs.
this
affidavit
was
really
a
sandwich
type
in
the
sense
that
it
had
an
introductory
paragraph,
a
short
one
and
a
concluding
paragraph,
which
was
a
short
one.
and
then
sandwiched
in
between
the
beginning
and
the
end
were
two
and
a
quarter
pages
of
typed
material,
single
space
on
legal
sized
paper,
many,
many
facts
were
cited,
sandwiched
in
between
the
beginning
and
the
end,
but
without
any
specification
or
identification
as
you
know
from
yesterday's
argument
as
to
who
saw
what
or
whether
the
people
who
gave
the
information
to
the
affiant
themselves
saw
what
were
reported.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
yes.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
it
has
been
held
in
cases
that
a
smell
of
mash
by
a
person
who
knows
the
smell
would
be
sufficient
to
sustain
an
affidavit,
but
at
least
in
those
cases,
it
was
clear
or
rather
in
those
cases,
they
identified
the
person
who
smelled
the
mash
or
in
our
brief
we
have
the
monnette
case
cited
and
the
johnson
case,
which
was
cited
by
my
brother
yesterday,
and
it
was
the
affiant
who
smelled
the
mash.
now
--
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
yes
--
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
no
but
--
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
yes.
but
you
have
to
put
together
then
and
allow
first
a
hearsay
affidavit
and
secondly,
a
hearsay
affidavit
involving
only
the
smell
of
mash
and
as
judge
aldrich
said
in
his
opinion
in
the
circuit
court,
“if
we're
going
to
go
on
smell
and
smell
alone,
then
we
have
to
pay
some
attention
to
the
guidelines
laid
down
in
the
johnson
case,
find
out
who
it
was,
who
smelled
the
item,
what
the
circumstances
were.”
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
clark?
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
well,
we
don't
know
in
this
affidavit,
whether
the
affiant
knew
anything
that
was
substantial
or
that
went
to
the
merits
of
the
probable
cause
as
the
court
in
boston
said,
probably
the
only
thing
the
affiant
knew
was
the
defendant's
address
or
the
color
of
the
defendant's
automobile.
and
in
fact,
i
think
the
government
has
conceded
mr.
justice
clark
that
this
affidavit
can
only
fairly
be
looked
upon
as
a
total
hearsay,
since
the
affiant
didn't
make
it
clear
just
what
it
was
he
saw
if
he
any
thing.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
i
think
it
might
be,
mr.
justice
brennan.
if
an
affidavit
were
so
drawn
and
it
was
clear
that
it
was
intended
to
rely
on
the
smell
and
smell
alone,
and
attention
was
focused
on
that
one
issue.
and
there
was
some
substantiation
of
some
lateral
support
to
what
the
hearsay
was
that
was
in
the
affidavit
or
there
was
some
reason
why
the
names
of
the
informers
could
not
be
disclosed.
that
maybe
true
but
--
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
yes.
if
i
may
discuss
the
jones
case,
in
that
case,
didone
was
the
affiant
and
the
affidavit
is
spelled
out
on
the
footnote.
and
he
relied
on
hearsay
insofar
as
that
item
was
concerned,
which
went
to
the
probable
cause,
the
existence
of
narcotics
in
someone's
apartment.
but
your
bench
five
years
ago
in
that
case
went
on
to
say
that
there
was
some
substantiation
beyond
the
hearsay.
didone
personally
knew
things
too
when
he
put
them
in
the
affidavit.
he
knew
that
these
people
had
a
narcotics
record
and
he
said
so
in
the
affidavit.
they
admitted
to
him,
use
of
narcotics.
they
had
admitted,
shown
him
needle
marks
in
their
arms,
and
that
was
in
the
affidavit
in
the
jones
case.
so
your
court
went
on
to
say
that
hearsay
does
not
disqualify
an
affidavit,
but
i
don't
read
the
jones
case
and
many
courts
do
not,
as
opening
the
way
to
a
hearsay
affidavit.
i
think
there
maybe
some
confusion
on
the
circuits
and
in
the
district
courts
and
in
the
state
courts
as
a
result
of
the
wording
of
the
jones
case
as
to
just
what
you
meant
by
some
substantiation
giving
credit
to
the
hearsay.
some
courts
i
think
have
thought
since
the
jones
decision
that
now
hearsay
affidavits
are
okay
or
rather
affidavits,
which
aren't
affidavits
at
all
are
okay.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
well,
you
had
more
than
that
in
the
jones
case,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
and
that
maybe
enough
if
we
probe
a
little
more
deeply
into
who
the
informer
is.
now
--
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
well,
i
think
i'm
only
requiring,
mr.
justice
clark,
compliance
with
the
fourth
amendment
and
rule
41,
which
requires
that
not
only
that
the
evidence
and
that
these
facts,
but
did
someone
say
so,
and
did
he
say
so
under
oath.
and
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
rules
of
prohibative
evidence.
that
was
said
in
the
jones
case
that
this
is
not
a
matter
of
whether
we
believe
this
evidence
to
be
believable
or
credible.
it's
how
far
beyond
the
fourth
amendment
requirement
of
an
affidavit
can
we
go.
an
affidavit
means
that
he
has
sworn
that
what
he
said
is
the
truth,
and
he
knows
it.
now
the
jones
case
watered
down
the
fourth
amendment
just
a
little
bit,
and
i
believe
it's
a
good
law
and
it
said
that
there
are
instances
in
these
affidavits
where
some
hearsay
can
creep
in.
let's
not
open
wide
the
gates
so
this
man
can
prepare
an
affidavit
as
a
pro
forma
matter
and
sweep
off
the
top
of
the
desk
and
then
just
comply
with
the
fourth
amendment
by
signing
it
at
the
bottom
and
taking
an
oath
as
the
head
of
an
administrative
governmental
office
could
do
and
as
mr.
mazaka
may
have
done
in
this
case,
we
just
don't
know.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
i
do.
[inaudible]
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
well
i
--
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
i
cited
the
aguilar
case
on
page
17.
i
was
happy
to
read
the
decision
that
was
my
way.
i
think
if
you
sustain
--
if
you
held
the
affidavit
insufficient
in
the
aguilar
case,
you
should
do
so
here,
because
that
was
an
affidavit
that
permitted
hearsay
upon
hearsay
as
mr.
chief
justice
warren
indicated
yesterday
as
a
possibility,
what
we
sometimes
call
totem
pole
hearsay.
that
affidavit
in
the
aguilar
case
said
for
all
that
appears,
the
source
here
nearly
suspected,
believed,
or
concluded
that
there
were
narcotics
in
petitioner's
possession.
the
magistrate
here
certainly
could
not
judge
for
himself,
he
felt
the
persuasiveness
of
the
fact.
it
contained
--
the
affidavit
contains
no
affirmative
allegation
that
the
affiant
spoke
with
personal
knowledge
of
the
matters
contained
therein.
it
does
not
even
contain
an
affirmative
allegation
that
the
affiant's
unidentified
source
spoke
with
personal
knowledge,
and
that's
another
quarrel
i
have
with
this
affidavit,
that
not
only
is
it
hearsay,
it's
conceivably
totem
pole
hearsay,
and
therefore
not
an
affidavit
at
all.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
on
those
two
isolated
instances
called
out
of
two
and
one
quarter
pages
mr.
justice
clark,
you
are
correct.
when
we
look
at
this
affidavit
as
a
whole,
it's
anonymous
and
it's
faceless.
but
we
can
nitpick
through
it
if
we
choose
and
as
mr.
justice
aldrich
said
in
boston,
“we
can
cart
in
a
barrow-load
of
pay
dirt
and
place
it
before
the
magistrate
or
the
court
and
say
you
pan
out
if
you
will
a
possible
nugget
or
two.”
but
that
is
not
a
substantial
compliance
with
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
opinion
of
judge
aldrich
of
the
boston
bench,
nor
do
i
think
so
either.
coming
back
to
mr.
goldberg's
question,
sure,
we
can
find
if
we
search
a
couple
of
items
in
here,
which
if
standing
alone
and
which
if
made
themselves
the
substance
of
this
affidavit
might
qualify
it.
but
should
we
do
that?
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
perhaps,
he
was
and
perhaps
he
wasn't,
mr.
justice
clark,
and
that's
what
we
don't
know.
in
other
words
--
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
i
don't
think
it
requires
a
lawyer
to
include
the
names
of
the
people
who
saw
all
these
things.
somebody
did
a
good
job
here
in
gathering
facts.
somebody
did
a
careful
job
in
typing
two
and
one
quarter
pages,
single
spaced,
a
recitation
of
facts,
and
i
don't
think
that
it's
a
hyper-technical
requirement
as
the
government's
brief
says
to
include
the
name.
in
other
words
--
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
i
don't
think
so.
no.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
yes.
well,
probably
because
i
know
the
facts
of
the
case,
i
might
--
maybe
why
i
say
no,
148
1/2
coburn
avenue
was
in
a
backyard
of
what
we
call
a
three-decker
in
massachusetts.
i
think
they
would
have
been
taking
the
law
into
their
own
hands,
if
they
had
done
that.
when
we
talk
about
these
investigators
smelling
mash
and
can
that
be
the
basis
to
search,
invade
and
search
someone's
house
just
to
smell,
we
should
look
at
all
of
the
circumstances
and
as
judge
aldrich
said
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
“let's
look
at
them”,
and
that's
what
the
johnson
case
says
and
judge
aldrich
said,
it's
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
i
can
always
remember
the
investigator
who
said
he
could
smell
the
mash
coming
from
the
fourth
floor
of
the
six
storey
building
while
he
was
on
the
sidewalk.
now
suppose
that
were
the
case
here,
would
that
justify
a
search
for
this
man's
home?
i
would
say
no.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
this
was
in
the
basement.
yes.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
yes,
we
should
look
at
all
the
circumstances.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
yes.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
yes.
the
issue
was
the
sufficiency
of
affidavit
and
if
the
affidavit
is
insufficient
then
there
is
no
probable
cause.
so
it
comes
down
to
an
issue
of
probable
cause.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
no,
i'm
not
--
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
no,
there
is
no
longer
any
question
raised
here
as
to
whether
or
not
all
these
facts,
if
they
are
true
and
if
somebody
took
an
oath
to
their
existence
would
constitute
probable
cause.
coming
back
to
--
i'd
like
to
discuss
just
a
second
the
jones
case
and
then
go
again
to
this
particular
affidavit,
but
when
i
said
there
maybe
some
confusion
as
to
the
application
of
the
jones
rule,
which
i
think
is
good
law
and
should
stand,
the
ramirez
case
in
the
second
circuit,
i
think
had
a
pretty
good
statement
in
it.
and
the
ramirez
case
was
calling
attention
to
what
i'm
calling
attention
to
now,
that
if
you
water
down
the
fourth
amendment
and
rule
41,
so
as
to
allow
the
introduction
of
some
hearsay
in
these
affidavits
and
specifically,
if
you
allow
that
hearsay
to
go
to
the
root
of
the
subject
matter,
then
in
jones
you
said
there
still
must
be
a
substantial
basis
for
crediting
the
hearsay
and
what
did
your
court
mean
when
you
said
that?
and
the
ramirez
case
says
that
the
jones
case
has
now
established
that
an
affidavit
consisting
primarily
of
hearsay
information
maybe
sufficient
to
support
the
issuance
of
a
search
warrant.
however,
the
requirement
that
the
affiant
shall
have
personal
knowledge
still
exists.
now,
mazaka
had
no
personal
knowledge
in
this
case
that
we
know
of,
that
went
to
the
heart
of
the
affidavit.
and
the
ramirez
case
went
on
to
say
for
under
jones
the
affiant
must
not
only
believe
the
hearsay
report,
but
in
all
likelihood
the
affiant
must
further
demonstrate
that
his
informant
has
established
a
reputation
for
reliability
so
as
to
be
worthy
of
belief.
and
this
second
circuit
case
goes
on
to
say
again,
in
addition,
jones
may
require
that
the
affidavit
includes
some
factual
information
independently
corroborative
of
the
hearsay
report.
now
if
we
agree
that
this
was
a
total
hearsay
affidavit,
then
we
come
to
the
inevitable
conclusion
that
there
is
nothing
in
it
that
is
independently
corroborative
of
that
that
is
hearsay.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
that
was
argued
in
the
boston
hearing
and
there
isn't
--
not
much
stress
is
put
on
that
in
the
government's
brief
before
this
court,
and
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice
harlan.
that
would
be
like
saying
that
here
is
a
statement,
which
is
really
not
an
affidavit.
this
man
probably
didn't
know
these
things,
but
if
he
says
a
lot,
the
very
weight
and
the
preponderance
of
all
these
facts
in
and
of
themselves
is
in
some
way
conclusive.
that
would
be
saying
that
a
one-page
affidavit,
which
does
not
comply
with
the
rule
should
be
discarded,
but
a
ten-page
affidavit
would
suffice.
in
other
words,
it
would
be
a
test
of
bigness.
if
you
have
10
pages
of
facts
that
may
or
may
not
be
true,
unless
you
know
they
are
true
and
that
someone
is
willing
to
stand
up
and
be
counted
and
raise
his
right
hand
and
say
and
take
an
oath,
then
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
it's
one-page
or
100
pages
of
facts,
because
i
don't
think
the
bigness
of
the
affidavit
is
the
test.
i
think
the
test
is
the
fourth
amendment
and
rule
41.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
well,
when
we
are
trying
to
decide
how
far
from
the
literal
wording
of
the
fourth
amendment
we
can
go,
then
when
we
are
faced
with
that
problem,
we
are
faced
with
this.
number
one,
this
affiant
said
he
got
this
information
from
other
people
so
it's
hearsay.
other
investigators
–-
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
other
investigators
with
a
capital
i,
which
means
nothing
to
me
–
a
person
who
knows
nothing
about
the
internal
--
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
yes,
and
there
was
a
lot
that
was
made
--
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
yes.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
yes,
so
we
have
hearsay.
so
that's
one
problem,
who
reported
to
me
orally
the
results
of
their
observations
and
their
investigations.
so
now
we
have
hearsay
piled
on
hearsay.
and
i
think
the
problem
in
this
affidavit
is
not
with
anyone
quarrel
i
would
have
with
it,
but
the
sum
total
of
all
of
the
quarrels
that
i
have
with
it.
this
is
an
anonymous
and
a
faceless
document.
and
mr.
justice
--
justice
douglas
in
his
dissent
in
the
jones
case
i
think
pointed
out
this
particular
fear
here.
that
if
we
look
at
the
jones
decision
in
its
true
dimensions
then
we
are
opening
the
gates
to
a
faceless
or
a
unanimous
document.
there
probably
is
nothing
wrong
in
an
affidavit
in
requiring
that
the
name
of
the
man
who
saw
these
things
be
included.
if
we
know
who
it
was,
who's
responsible,
who's
willing
to
stand
up
and
be
counted,
then
we
have
some
comfort
or
a
magistrate
has
some
comfort,
because
he
may
know
the
man,
he's
looking
at
him
perhaps
in
granting
the
search
warrant.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
if
we
knew
who
they
were
and
if
we
knew
that
they
saw
what
they
reported
rather
than
getting
what
they
got
from
some
other
people
or
from
some
office
file
or
from
some
tipster
or
informer,
or
from
some
anonymous
telephone
call,
if
all
of
those
problems
where
it
could
be
excluded
from
this
affidavit,
then
this
would
be
an
affidavit.
without
them,
i
fear
that
it's
not
an
affidavit.
i
think
that,
i
can't
argue
or
even
research
this
case
or
write
this
brief
or
argue
the
decision
without
always
going
back
in
my
own
mind
to
the
why
of
this
thing,
why
do
we
require
an
affidavit?
it
seems
to
me
that
we're
looking
for
some
responsibility
somewhere.
mr.
justice
stewart
yesterday
read
from
the
decision
in
stanford
versus
texas
and
explained
at
length
the
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
why
it
was
written
into
the
constitution
shortly
after
the
ratification
of
the
document.
it
seems
to
me
that
we've
got
to
have
somebody
who
says,
“i
am
an
affiant.
i
plight
my
faith,”
which
is
what
affidavit
means,
“i
saw
these
things
and
insofar
as
i
didn't
see
them,
i've
got
some
basis
for
believing
in
the
truth
of
what
was
reported
to
me.”
if
we
don't
do
that,
then
we
have
nobody
responsible
to
turn
to.
now
that
would
be
academic
and
that
would
be
moot
i
suppose
in
this
case
or
in
many
cases
where
the
search
turns
out
to
be
successful
because
in
a
sense
for
success
of
the
search
retroactively
proves
the
affiant
to
have
been
correct.
but
we
should
look
of
course
at
the
possibility
or
at
the
case
where
the
search
is
not
successful
and
there
are
unsuccessful
searches
and
then
we
go
back
and
look
at
the
affidavit
as
we
could
in
this
case
and
we
would
go
to
mr.
mazaka
and
we
would
say,
“we
did
what
you
wanted
us
to
do.
we
tore
the
house
as
under
as
in
boston
recently.
we
ripped
up
the
patio
in
the
backyard
with
a
steam
shovel,
but
we
didn't
find
the
stolen
mail
money.”
and
you'd
go
back
and
look
at
the
affidavit
and
to
out
who
it
was
who
signed
it
and
mr.
mazaka
could
say,
“don't
ask
me.
i
didn't
say
in
here
that
i
saw
anything”
and
then
you
could
say,
“well,
mr.
mazaka,
who
was
it
that
told
you
these
things
that
resulted
in
the
government
tearing
this
man's
house
apart
stick-by-stick,
rifle
through
the
back
pocket
of
his
pants
when
he
wasn't
in
them”
and
mr.
mazaka
would
have
to
say
“government
investigators
with
a
capital
i”,
and
that's
meaningless
to
me.
then
you
would
say,
“mr.
mazaka,
who
were
they?
they
are
superior
and
the
treasury
department
would
like
to
talk
with
them.”
well,
i
don't
remember
anymore.
it
would
be
a
possible
answer.
another
possible
answer
would
be,
well
i
don't'
want
to
give
you
their
names
or
they
might
get
in
trouble.
so
we
look
at
this
affidavit
as
it
stands
before
the
search.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
i
could
if
your
honor
please
when
the
trial
is
on.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
no,
because
i
didn't
feel
i
needed
too.
if
the
search
is
successful
and
results
in
an
indictment,
then
we
have
the
right
to
search,
to
apply
on
motion
for
the
names
and
for
the
statements,
but
if
the
search
is
unsuccessful,
mr.
justice
clark,
there
was
never
any
trial.
there
was
never
any
case.
there
was
never
any
forum
for
filing
a
motion,
but
i
don't
think
the
burden
of
getting
the
names
into
the
affidavit
should
be
on
the
defendant.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
i
do.
i
think
it's
much
better
to
have
the
information
come
from
a
government
employee
or
from
a
police
officer.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
i
couldn't
quite
hear
you,
mr.
justice.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
i
would
think
they
would.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
no,
but
i
think
these
cases
are
of
general
application
and
if
you
sustain
this
affidavit,
you
are
clearing
the
way
for
faceless
affidavits
in
all
states
of
the
union,
in
police
departments
of
the
lowest
type
as
well
as
of
the
highest
type,
in
state
agencies
and
in
federal
agencies.
and
if
this
affidavit
is
sustained,
then
it
would
be
possible
for
the
head
of
the
office
merely
to
take
out
the
contents
of
the
file
and
put
it
all
in
one
document
and
then
say,
of
course,
we
must
have
an
affidavit
here,
so
i
as
the
head
of
the
office
will
be
the
one
to
take
the
oath?
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
yes.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
yes
sir.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
i
think
that
the
jones
case
controls
and
if
you
--
if
it's
based
upon
information
supplied
by
an
informer,
there
must
be
something
else
in
there
that
is
not
hearsay
that
will
give
substantiation
in
the
words
of
this
very
court
to
the
hearsay
that
is
in
the
affidavit
and
i
agree
that
information
can
come
from
an
informer
provided
there
is
something
else
in
there
to
give
some
substantiation.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
i
don't
think
we
should
be
discouraged,
mr.
justice
goldberg
by
problems
of
the
police
department.
i
think
all
they
would
have
to
do,
would
be
to
find
out
who
was
it,
who
uncovered
these
facts,
and
who
--
and
put
his
name
in
it,
so
that
the
magistrate
would
be
able
to
decide
for
himself
whether
this
affidavit
contains
probable
cause
and
not
the
police
department.
otherwise,
a
police
officer
can
come
in
known
to
the
magistrate
and
say,
“don't
worry
mr.
magistrate,
i
know
what
i'm
talking
about”.
i
don't
think
it's
an
unfair
burden
on
the
police
department
or
an
investigating
agency
to
have
them
include
the
names
of
the
people
and
by
names,
i
don't
mean
–
we're
not
talking
about
names,
it's
identity
we
want,
it's
responsibility
we
want.
it
isn't
the
names
so
much
of
what
the
man's
name
is,
it's
who
he
is.
now,
the
government
has
said
–
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
well,
i
think
the
important
thing
mr.
justice
brennan
in
asking
that
his
name
be
included
is
that
not
that
his
name
is
john
or
robert,
but
that
the
affidavit
not
to
be
anonymous,
that
somebody
be
responsible
for
it.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
yes.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
there
are
cases
mr.
justice
clark
let's
say
that
police
departments
are
not
the
champions
of
neutrality
between
prosecutions
and
the
defendants.
i
agree.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
and
i
would
think
so,
and
i
would
certainly
want
to
think
so,
but
there
would
be
the
chance
of
it
going
the
other
way,
unless
the
police
have
to
identify
themselves
and
stand
up
and
be
counted.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
well,
there
has
to
be
an
eyewitness
at
some
level,
mr.
justice
black
in
the
sense
that
the
man
who
signs
the
affidavit
or
who
makes
known
the
information
has
to
get
it
somehow
whether
by
the
five
senses.
it
must
be
–
he
must
–
he
has
to
see,
smell,
touch
or
feel
in
order
to
--
to
sign
an
affidavit,
he
must
know
what
he's
talking
about.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
saw
this
thing
--
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
then
i
think
so
--
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
yes,
because
that
would
have
done
two
things,
it
would
have
made
somebody
responsible
and
identified
them,
and
it
would
have
shown
that
we
did
not
have
totem
pole
hearsay
here
or
hearsay
on
hearsay
or
that
--
that
the
information
stemmed
from
a
government
employee
who
is
reliable,
yes.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
well,
i'm
supposing
that
there
would
be
other,
that
there
would
be
the
substantiation
called
for
by
jones
that
these
people
--
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
--
would
not
be
enough
--
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
no,
no.
i'm
assuming
also
that
you
would
have
that
added
factor,
you
generally
do
that
these
people
are
reliable
in
some
way.
they
just
didn't
join
the
department
yesterday.
they
have
no
part
as
an
interest
here,
things
of
that
sort.
mr.
matthew
r.
mccann
i
think
it
would
help
if
your
honor
please,
where
an
affidavit
has
as
many
problems
as
i
see
in
this
one.
so
in
short,
i
subscribe
to
the
rule
of
the
jones
case
that
asks
for
some
substantiation.
i
think
this
affidavit
does
not
have
any
and
i
would
respectfully
request
that
the
decision
of
the
first
circuit
be
affirmed.
thank
you
very
much.
