well,

justice

justice

stewart
well
and
it
also
says
that
it
implies
that
if

if
there
had
been
a
search
warrant
secured
in
that
case,
there
would
have
been
no
question
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
search
that
the
--
there
was
no
emergency
in
that
case

stands

proposition
that

to
be
decided
by
a

when
he
issues
the
warrant.

of
the

any
question
with
respect
to
any
other
aspects
of
the
warrant.
