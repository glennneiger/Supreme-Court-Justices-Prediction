justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
that
was
a
team
inquiry,
and
he
was
the
team
captain
so
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
it
appear
that
he
perhaps
was
the
chief
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
it
is
fair
to
read
this
as
something
told
to
him,
the
one
who
signed
the
[inaudible]
by
other
officers
working
with
him
on
it,
what’s
your
argument
with
the
others
that
are
reliable
within
the
standing
of
the
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
distinguish
then
their
official
status
from
the
status
of
an
undercover
informer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
all
the
while
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
am
right,
am
i
not
that
he
whose
official
connection
is
only
rather
so-called
special
faith
employee,
he
doesn’t
get
the
same
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
his
information
doesn’t
have
the
same
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he’s
on
the
government
payroll
too.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
well
would
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
black
be
difference,
if
he
changed
this
question
and
say
this
affiant
made
a
statement,
an
undercover
man
told
me
everything
that
justice
black
said,
would
that
be
a
different
case?
he
just
stopped
with
an
undercover
man
told
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
a
special
employee
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
weaker?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
no
case.
if
jones
means
anything
it
has
no
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
is
justified
hypothetically,
where
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
you
said
whatever
about
the
reliability
and
special
employee.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
–
just
like
jones.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
mccann,
those
paragraphs
that
said
not
merely
investigators
smelled
the
odor
of
mash,
but
investigators
by
experience,
hired
the
affiant
known
to
be
reliable
to
smell
the
odor
of
mash.
would
the
case
be
different?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
under
jones,
would
all
those
things
have
to
be
true
or
would
it
not
have
been
enough?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
suggesting
mr.
mccann,
in
fact
you
are
right
that
it
would
not
be
enough,
for
example,
to
say
i
was
told
this
by
x.
x
is
someone
who
had
previously
given
me
information.
i
found
that
information
to
be
reliable,
and
that's
all
what
the
affidavit
said.
are
you
suggesting
that
may
not
be
enough?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
aren't
–-
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
identify
who
he
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
is
that
to
say,
mr.
mccann,
if
they've
been
already
added
here
in
each
of
these
paragraphs,
investigators
smith
and
jones,
that
would
be
enough.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
--
everything
that's
in
those
two
paragraphs
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
-–
added
to
it,
investigators
smith
and
jones.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
does
that
follow?
you're
merely
saying
that
investigators
smith
and
jones,
that
that
would
qualify
the
affidavit.
smith
and
jones
maybe
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
just
smith
and
jones.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
not
be
enough.
