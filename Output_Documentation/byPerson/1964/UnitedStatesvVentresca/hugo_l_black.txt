what
if
it
had
been
an
undercover
men?
affidavit
has
shown
that
i
am
an
undercover
man
and
i’m
being
paid
and
i’m
an
undercover
man.
i
watched,
i
saw
this,
i
smelled
the
mash
and
i’m
going
to
smell
the
mash,
i
have
to
pour
it
out
and
he
goes
as
far
as
that
so
just
as
[inaudible]
search
warrant,
would
that
not
be
enough
to
show
probable
cause?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you’re
not
basing
your
case,
are
you
only

that
it
could
never
be
a
probable
cause,
because
it’s
an
undercover
man
that’s
says
this
point.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
thought
you
said
he
saw
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
perhaps
the
magistrate
who
read
the
affidavit
there
in
person
saw
the
officer
and
knew
all
about
it,
perhaps
he
was
then
correct
or
not
as
you
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
didn't
have
more
technicality
in
the
affidavit,
but
you
would
have
to
have
a
lawyer
almost
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
was
this,
in
the
building
or
the
basement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
wouldn't
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understood
you
just
said
a
lot
of
[inaudible]
had
to
be
somebody
who
swears
to
it
who
knows
the
fact.
