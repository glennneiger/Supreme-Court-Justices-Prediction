ventresca.
mr.
goodman?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
affidavit
say
that
they
were
officers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
includes
the
undercover
man
and
the
informers
and
so
on.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
could
we
know
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
said
it
came
from
either
from
observations
or
investigation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
who
would
the
investigators
include?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
how
do
we
know
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
investigators
are
police
officers.
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn’t
it
common
usage
in
that
business
to
have
undercover
man
who
themselves
are
derelicts
and
a
part
of,
almost
a
part
of
the
business
to
give
the
initial
information
upon
which
prosecutions
of
this
kind
remain?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
you
say
that
it
was
an
investigator
with
a
capital
i,
that
you’ve
been
talking
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
reason
i
ask
you
that
is
because
of
the
first
question
i
asked
you,
the
first
paragraph
is
based
upon
observations
made
by
me
and
based
upon
information
received
officially
from
other
investigators
attached
this
alcohol
and
tobacco
tax
division
and
assigned
to
this
investigation
and
reports
made
orally
to
me
describing
the
results
of
their
observations
and
investigation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
how
do
we
know
what
the
observations
of
the
investigation
--
investigators
were
and
what
their
investigation
revealed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
maybe
coming
from
other
persons
in
there
--
persons
and
therefore
piling
hearsay
upon
hearsay.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
ask
you
about
you
were
saying
this
was
critical
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
crucial
to
it
and
i
asked
you
who
saw
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
you
think
undercover
men
couldn’t
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that’s
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that’s
the
nature
of
the
work,
that
such
men
are
employed
to
do?
chief
justice
earl
warren
nor
have
you
said
that
he
was
a
reliable
undercover
man?
chief
justice
earl
warren
[inaudible]
unreliable
ones
