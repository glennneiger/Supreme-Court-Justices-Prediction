part
of
the
thing
is
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
can
see
that
much
because
of
the
two
instances
here
it
couldn’t
be
hearsay.
one
of
the
paragraphs
starts
off
on
august
18th
investigators
smelled
–
they
could
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
i’m
thinking
about
that.
justice
tom
c.
clark
go
around
in
the
next
day,
on
the
august
the
30th
at
about
4
o’clock
in
the
morning
an
odor
of
fermenting
mash
was
detected
while
investigators
were
walking
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
it.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
that
would
be
a
personal
knowledge,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
oh
no.
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
the
knowledge
did
investigate.
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
the
name
of
the
investigator,
alcohol
and
tobacco
tax
division.
justice
tom
c.
clark
he
must
be
an
investigator
wasn’t
he?
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
investigation
went
on
through
for
30
days.
justice
tom
c.
clark
even
after
19
days
because
they
were
smelling
mash
at
4
o’clock
in
the
morning.
justice
tom
c.
clark
[inaudible]
everything
went
on
against
him
except
his
routine
–
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
these
were
undercover
in
the
[inaudible],
i
thought
that
was
in
the
narcotics.
justice
tom
c.
clark
it
could
be
a
hearsay
affidavit
in
some
charity,
would
it,
he
said
that
he
personally
acknowledged
some
of
the
facts,
but
didn't
say
which
one.
justice
tom
c.
clark
why
are
you
requiring
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
[inaudible]
didn't
he?
[inaudible]
not
only
lifted.
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
search
could
have
been
made
here
without
a
warrant
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
that
were
set
forth
in
this
affidavit?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
don't
think
so?
justice
tom
c.
clark
if
investigators
--
if
investigators
were
walking
up
and
down
and
had
somebody
under
observation
and
the
smelled
mash
and
heard
noises
inside
the
premises
and
did
it
on
two
separate
occasions,
would
that
have
constituted
probable
cause
for
a
search?
justice
tom
c.
clark
did
you
try
to
get
their
names?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but,
did
you
try?
justice
tom
c.
clark
do
you
think
this
is
different
from
a
typical
informer
to
say
that,
to
gain
information
from
one
who
they
thought
was
reliable?
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
records
of
the
department,
if
possible,
they
reflect
the
former
investigation
of
it.
do
they
not?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
said
the
records
of
the
alcohol
department
would
reflect
who
was
on
that
investigation.
justice
tom
c.
clark
it
shouldn't
be
any
trouble
in
you
getting
their
names
if
you
wanted
to?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
the
court
has
sustained
again
and
again
that
it
will
obtain
[inaudible]
this
informant
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
it's
required
upon
application
that
his
name
be
disclosed
in
certain
cases.
justice
tom
c.
clark
so,
that
evidently
is
a
practice
that's
well
expanded.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
i
agree
with
you.
i
think
when
you
said
[inaudible]
of
an
informant.
justice
tom
c.
clark
of
known
reliability,
because
i'm
the
one
that
believes
an
investigator's
general
rule
is
to
[inaudible]
of
the
people.
justice
tom
c.
clark
frankly,
i
have
been
in
this
for
a
long
time
where
i
came
into
court
and
i
–
the
overwhelming
number
of
cases
that
came
to
my
attention
where
there
were
honest,
upright,
reliable
people.
justice
tom
c.
clark
so
that's
with
that
is?
they
have
been
in
department
20
years.
