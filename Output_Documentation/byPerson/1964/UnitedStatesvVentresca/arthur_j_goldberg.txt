your
argument
was
this,
that
even
if
the
affidavit
did
not
refer
to
observations
made
by
affiant,
neither
the
said
based
upon
information
received
officially
from
other
investigators
attached
et
cetera
and
then
detailed
--
detailed
in
the
state
of
[inaudible]
affidavit
and
under
jones
and
other
decisions,
this
would
be
sufficient
because
hearsay
is
sufficient
to
warrant
an
affidavit,
a
warrant
to
have
that
order.
is
that
your
position
here
ultimately?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
this
is
independent
of
what
this
applies
so
first?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
mccann
â€“
with
in
reference
to
that,
could
you
turn
to
the
record,
page
7,
the
first
paragraph
about
the
smelling
the
odor
of
fermenting
mash,
and
then
the
next
to
the
last
paragraph
on
page
8.
now,
is
it
not
apparent
that
those
two
paragraphs
that
these
are
investigators
who
smelled
the
mash?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
isn't
the
putting
all
the
rest
of
the
affidavit
aside,
why
under
long
line
of
decisions,
would
that
not
be
sufficient?

mr.
mccann,
if
we
strike
down
on
this
affidavit,
what
would
ever
be
the
incentive
on
the
part
of
the
police
to
get
a
warrant?
wouldn't
they
be
much
better
off
acting
without
a
warrant,
than
justifying
it
on
showing
of
a
probable
cause?
