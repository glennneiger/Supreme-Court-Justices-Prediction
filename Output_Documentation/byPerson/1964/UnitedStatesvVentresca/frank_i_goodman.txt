mr.
frank
i.
goodman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
this
case
involving
the
validity
of
a
search
warrant
is
here
on
the
government’s
petition
for
certiorari
from
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
the
respondent,
giacomo
ventresca,
was
tried
by
a
jury
under
indictments
charging
him
with
possessing
and
operating
an
illegal
distill
and
with
conspiracy.
he
was
convicted
on
all
accounts
and
sentenced
to
imprisonment
for
a
total
of
three
years.
both
prior
to
the
trial
and
again
during
the
trial,
the
respondent
moved
unsuccessfully
to
the
suppression
of
certain
evidence,
including
the
distilling
apparatus
itself,
which
the
government
had
seized
pursuant
to
a
search
warrant.
the
first
circuit
with
one
judge
dissenting
reversed
the
conviction
on
the
ground
that
the
affidavit
submitted
by
the
government
in
support
of
its
application
for
the
search
warrant
had
failed
to
establish
probable
cause
and
the
sole
issue
in
this
case
is
the
legal
sufficiency
of
that
affidavit.
the
affidavit
is
found
on
pages
4
through
8
of
the
record.
it
was
made
by
walter
mazaka
who
was
an
investigator
of
the
alcohol
and
tobacco
tax
division
of
the
internal
revenue
service
and
i
might
point
out
here
that
an
investigator
is
a
regular
full
time
agent
of
the
service.
it
is
not
to
be
confused
with
the
so-called
special
employees
on
which
the
government
sometimes
relies,
particularly
in
narcotics
cases.
the
affidavit
begins
with
the
statement
that
the
affiant
has
reason
to
believe
that
certain
property
including
a
distilling
apparatus
and
other
materials
used
in
the
manufacture
of
non
tax-paid
liquor
are
being
concealed
at
a
house
occupied
by
ventresca
and
his
family
at
148
1/2
coburn
avenue
in
worcester.
the
grounds
for
this
belief
are
then
set
forth
in
considerable
detail
on
a
separate
sheet
which
was
prefaced
by
the
following
introductory
paragraph
and
i
read
from
page
5.
“based
upon
observations
made
by
me
and
based
upon
information
received
officially
from
other
investigators
attached
to
the
alcohol
and
tobacco
tax
divisions
assigned
to
this
investigation
and
reports
orally
made
to
me
describing
the
results
of
their
observations
and
investigation,
this
request
for
the
issuance
of
a
search
warrant
is
made.”
the
affidavit
then
sets
forth
seven
specific
instances
during
the
period
july
the
28th
to
august
the
30th,
1961
in
which
a
pontiac
automobile
owned
and
operated
by
joseph
garry
who
was
a
co-defendant
in
this
case
and
having
joseph
incardone
as
its
passenger
stopped
in
the
courtyard
right
in
front
of
ventresca’s
house.
on
four
of
those
occasions,
the
automobile
was
said
to
be
--
said
to
be
loaded
with
60-pound
sacks
of
sugar.
on
two
other
occasions,
it
was
seen
to
carry
large
five
gallon
tin
containers.
on
the
seventh
occasion,
it
was
merely
described
as
being
heavily
laden.
in
one
instance,
the
affidavit
specifically
states
that
the
automobile
was
followed
between
boston
and
worcester
and
in
at
least
three
other
instances,
it’s
quite
clear
i
think
from
the
description
of
the
movements
of
the
automobile
that
the
person
who
observed
it
had
followed
it.
in
one
case,
the
affidavit
states
that
these
large
metal
containers
were
seen
carried
from
the
automobile
into
ventresca’s
house
and
similar
containers,
this
time
apparently
filled
with
liquid,
were
later
seen
to
be
being
loaded
into
the
trunk
of
garry’s
car.
in
two
instances,
at
midnight
and
these
on
the
same
days
in
which
the
automobile
had
earlier
been
seen
making
these
deliveries
at
ventresca’s
house,
the
car
was
seen
to
pull
up
in
front
of
garry’s
house
in
a
boston
suburb.
and
on
both
of
those
occasions,
either
garry
or
incardone
got
out
of
the
car,
carried
several
metal
containers
apparently
filled
with
liquid
two
by
two
into
the
house
and
none
of
the
paragraphs
which
i’ve
summarized
so
far
said
in
so
many
words
who
it
was
who
made
the
observation.
there
were
two
other
paragraphs
however
which
did
states
specifically
that
the
observations
were
made
by
investigators
and
these
paragraphs
stated
that
on
august
18
and
again
on
august
the
30,
1961,
investigators,
while
walking
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
148
coburn
avenue
which
i
gather
is
the
house
immediately
adjacent
to
ventresca’s,
detected
the
odor
of
fermenting
mash
and
on
the
latter
occasion,
that
they
heard
sound
similar
to
that
of
a
motor
or
a
pump
coming
from
the
direction
of
ventresca’s
house.
it
was
the
day
after
the
second
of
these
two
fermenting
mash
observations,
that
the
government
applied
for
and
obtained
a
search
warrant
and
it
was
the
day
after
that
that
the
search
was
made.
the
affidavit
concludes
with
the
following
statement.
“the
foregoing
information,”
this
is
on
page
8,
“the
foregoing
information
is
based
upon
personal
knowledge
and
information
which
has
been
obtained
from
investigators
of
the
alcohol
and
tobacco
tax
division,
internal
revenue
service
who
have
been
assigned
to
this
investigation.
now
we
agree
with
the
court
below
that
in
as
much
as
mazaka
did
not
say
specifically
which
of
the
statements
in
the
affidavit
were
based
on
his
own
personal
observations,
it’s
fair
to
evaluate
the
document
on
the
assumption
that
all
of
the
statements
were
based
upon
information
which
he
received
from
his
fellow
officers.
that
of
course
is
merely
the
beginning
of
the
inquiry.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
it
says
that
all
of
the
information
which
is
set
forth
in
the
affidavit
is
based
either
upon
mazaka’s
personal
observations
or
upon
information
which
he
has
received
from
other
investigators
of
the
alcohol
and
tobacco
tax
division.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
it
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
it
states
that
it
comes
from
investigators
and
these
are
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no,
it
comes
either
from
observations
by
him
or
from
information
which
he
has
received
from
other
investigators.
now,
the
affidavit
does
not
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
the
word
investigators
simply
includes
these
other
police
officers.
but
what
--
now
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
you
have
in
mind
a
different
question
which
is
the
central
question
in
this
case.
all
that
i
was
saying
is
that
his
immediate
informants,
the
affiant’s
immediate
informants
were
so
called
investigators
with
a
capital
i
which
is
the
more
or
less
official
even
statutory
name
for
full
time
agents
of
the
alcohol
and
tobacco
tax
division.
now
what
the
affidavit
does
not
state
in
so
many
words,
and
this
i
think
is
the
central
issue
here,
is
how
the
investigators
got
their
information,
that
is
to
say
whether
they
got
it
from
their
own
personal
observations
or
whether
they
in
turn
gathered
it
from
information
given
to
them
by
other
people
who
are
not
mentioned
in
the
affidavit.
that
i
think
is
the
ultimate
issue.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
he
said
that
it’s
possible
that
it
might
have
come
from
such
unnamed
and
so
far
as
it
appears
here
unreliable
sources.
in
leading
up
to
that
issue,
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
that
in
the
jones
case
this
court
held
that
an
affidavit
which
is
based
partly
or
even
wholly
on
hearsay
is
not
for
that
reason
insufficient
provided
that
there
is
a
substantial
basis
for
crediting
that
hearsay.
so
the
issue
here
is
whether
there’s
a
substantial
basis
for
crediting
the
hearsay
which
we
will
assume
the
affidavit
was
based
upon.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
pardon
me?
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
yes
sir.
i’m
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
i
think
that’s
quite
true.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that’s
quite
right,
mr.
justice
clark
and
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
it
would
not
be
personal
knowledge
of
the
affiant
necessarily.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
and
it’s
in
that
sense
that
i’m
using
the
word
hearsay
as
to
him
even
those
two
observations
were
hearsay.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that’s
right.
now
with
respect
to
those
two
statements,
we
do
know
for
certain
that
the
investigators
got
their
information
by
their
own
personal
observations
and
one
of
our
contentions
in
this
case
is
that
those
two
observations
alone
were
sufficient
to
establish
probable
cause
even
without
more.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that
doesn’t
appear
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
don’t
know.
he
does
indicate
that
some
of
these
observations
were
made
by
himself
personally
which
would
sort
of
suggest
here
that
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
yes.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
he
was
an
investigator,
but
whether
he
held
an
administrative
position,
i
don’t
know.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
i
think
that
very
frequently
is
done,
but
as
i
indicated
in
this
case
at
least
some
of
the
personal
investigations
or
personal
observations
were
made
by
him.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well
i
think
it’s
quite
obvious
from
the
affidavit
that
this
was
a
team
inquiry,
that
observations
here
were
made
by
many
people
and
it’s
our
contention
that
these
many
people
were
all
investigators.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no,
it
doesn’t
appear
that
he
is
the
chief,
merely
that
he
was
one
of
the
[inaudible]
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that’s
right.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
exactly,
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that’s
quite
true
and
by
the
same
token,
this
is
one
of
the
considerations
which
leads
us
to
the
conclusion
that
all
of
these
invest
--
all
of
these
observations
were
made
by
police
officers,
albeit
not
the
affiant
himself.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that
the
other
police
officers
are
reliable?
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well
if
we
assume
one
--
if
we
assume
that
all
of
these
other
police
officers
and
i’ll
refer
to
them
as
that
for
simplicity
rather
than
as
an
investigators,
if
we
assume
that
all
of
these
police
officers
obtained
this
information
from
their
own
personal
observations
and
i
can
see
that
the
affidavit
does
not
so
indicate
it
in
so
many
words,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
--
and
that
they
communicated
this
officially
to
the
affiant.
it
seems
to
me
that
their
mere
status
as
investigators
is
the
credential
for
their
reliability.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that’s
correct.
now
i
would
suppose
for
example
that
the
eyewitness
reports
made
by
police
officers
detailing
their
personal
observations
in
the
course
of
an
official
investigation
and
communicated
officially
to
the
affiant
was
perhaps
the
highest
and
most
reliable
order
of
hearsay
and
certainly
more
reliable
for
example
than
similar
reports
coming
from
an
unidentified,
unofficial
informant.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
it
was
merely
said
to
given
reliable
information
in
the
past.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
certainly
not.
he
is
not
a
regular
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
for
the
special
purposes,
for
which
he
is
assigned,
yes.
but
here
we’re
talking
about
regular
full
time
police
officers
who
presumably
had
no
interest
in
the
case
of
any
kind
other
than
the
fact
that
they
had
been
assigned
to
investigate
it.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
i
think
primarily
it
is
in
the
narcotics
field.
i
wouldn’t
be
able
to
say
categorically
that
they
do
not
use
similar
special
employees
in
the
alcohol
and
tobacco
tax
division.
this
much
i
can
say
that
i’m
assured
although
this
does
not
appear
in
the
record,
i’m
assured
that
the
alcohol
and
tobacco
tax
division
does
not
use
so-called
special
employees
to
conduct
surveillance
of
the
type
which
one
can
infer
was
done
from
this
record,
which
is
simply
having
people
out
on
the
street
in
a
police
car
across
the
street
or
something
watching
the
house
to
see
who
comes
out
and
what
not.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no,
i
don’t
think
we
go
quite
that
far,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
we
don’t
say
that
the
mere
specificity
of
the
allegations
are
in
themselves
sufficient
to
make
the
test
of
jones.
what
we
say
is
that
an
affidavit
which
says
not
only
that
the
--
that
this
is
based
on
information
received
from
other
investigators,
but
also
that
it
sets
forth
the
results
of
their
observations
and
investigation.
and
which
then
describes
some
dozen
or
so
observations
which
are
of
a
tight,
which
could
only
have
been
made
by
police
officers.
and
which
therefore,
on
any
fair
reading
of
the
affidavit,
must
represent
the
personal
eyewitness
observations
of
police
officers.
in
that
case,
the
requirements
of
the
jones
case
aren't
there.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
yes.
in
other
words
if
the
affidavit
had
said
in
so
many
words,
everything
i’m
about
to
set
forth
is
based
upon
the
personal
observations
of
my
fellow
officers
assigned
to
this
investigation
and
communicated
directly
to
me,
i
submit
that,
that
clearly
would
meet
the
test
of
jones.
now
the
court
below
didn’t
disagree
with
that
at
all.
that
--
up
to
that
point,
i
think
the
court
below
was
in
agreement
with
us.
the
court
below
said
though
that
since
the
affidavit
does
not
say
in
so
many
words
that
these
observations
--
that
the
information
received
by
the
affiant
is
based
upon
observations
of
his
fellow
officers,
but
rather
that
it’s
based
on
observations
and
investigation
and
since
the
word
investigation
is
broad
enough
to
include
almost
every
imaginable
means
of
obtaining
information,
the
court
below
drew
the
conclusion
or
made
the
assumption
that
all
of
the
informants,
some
or
all
of
the
information
in
the
affidavit
had
been
obtained
by
the
other
investigators
from
unnamed
informants,
unnamed
outside
informants,
whose
reliability
does
not
appear.
at
least
the
court
said
the
government
hadn’t
specifically,
that
the
affidavit
had
not
specifically
negated
that
possibility.
now
our
position
is
essentially
that
that
this
reading
of
the
affidavit
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
all
together
unreasonable
and
that
for
at
least
three
reasons,
the
decision
should
be
reverse
and
our
three
reasons
are
these;
each
of
them
independent.
first,
those
observations
which
are
described
in
the
affidavit
which
were
not
specifically
stated
to
have
been
made
by
investigators
were
the
type
of
observations
which
could
only
have
been
made
by
investigators
conducting
a
systematic
month
long
surveillance
of
ventresca’s
house,
garry’s
house
in
this
boston
suburb
and
of
the
movements
of
the
automobile
as
it
moved
between
the
two.
secondly,
even
if
that
not
be
true,
even
if
the
court
concludes
that
all
of
those
paragraphs
in
the
affidavit
which
do
not
specify
the
source
of
the
observations
are
describing
information
obtained
ultimately
from
an
outside
informant,
still
there
are
two
paragraphs
in
the
affidavit
which
do
specifically
say
that
the
observations
were
made
by
investigators
and
these
alone
we
submit
are
sufficient
to
establish
probable
cause.
and
thirdly,
even
if
that
not
be
true,
even
if
those
two
observations
are
not
sufficient,
they
nonetheless
serve
to
corroborate
the
other
information
set
forth
in
the
affidavit
and
to
provide
a
substantial
basis
for
crediting
that
information
even
if
it
be
assumed
to
have
come
from
some
unidentified
informant.
now
with
respect
to
the
first
point,
that
is
to
say
that
these
observations
could
only
have
been
made
by
the
police
investigators,
i’d
like
to
point
out
first
that
this
is
not
just
one
or
two
casual
instances
which
are
described
here,
the
sort
of
thing
that
some
chance
passerby
might
have
seen
and
telephoned
into
the
police
or
something
like
that.
here,
there
are
about
12
separate
episodes
described
all
taking
place
within
one
month.
the
affidavit
specifically
states
that
on
at
least
two
occasions,
investigators
were
stationed
outside
ventresca’s
house
at
4
o’clock
in
the
morning.
in
several
instances,
it’s
clear
that
they
followed
an
automobile
between
boston
and
worcester
and
back
again.
now
private
people
do
not
ordinarily
follow
automobiles
from
one
city
to
another
city
no
matter
how
suspicious
or
inquisitive
they
maybe.
if
they
have
suspicions,
they
usually
call
up
the
police
and
let
the
police
do
the
following.
nor
is
it
i
think
reasonable
to
suppose
on
the
basis
of
this
affidavit,
that
any
substantial
part
of
this
information
could
have
come
from
some
insider
or
some
confederate,
because
it’s
quite
clear
that
the
person
who
made
the
observations
had
no
access
to
the
interior
of
ventresca’s
house
or
to
the
interior
of
garry’s
house
and
in
that
regard,
i’d
like
to
read
one
paragraph
to
the
court
from
the
affidavit
which
to
me
seems
to
epitomize
the
whole.
it’s
on
page
7,
the
middle
of
page
7.
it
says,
“about
midnight,
the
pontiac
was
observed
pulling
up
in
front
of
garry’s
house
at
59
highland
street,
hyde
park,”
this
is
the
boston
suburb.
“garry
was
driving
and
incardone
was
the
passenger.
they
both
got
out
of
the
car.
garry
opened
the
trunk
and
then
entered
his
house.
from
the
trunk
of
the
car,
there
was
removed
11
five
gallon
cans
which
appeared
to
be
filled.
incardone
made
six
trips
to
a
door
on
the
side
of
the
house.
he
carried
two
five
gallon
cans
on
each
trip,
except
the
sixth
trip.
on
that
trip,
he
carried
one
can
having
passed
the
others
to
somebody
in
the
doorway
and
on
the
last
trip,
he
entered
the
house.
he
remained
there
at
least
45
minutes
and
was
not
observed
to
leave.”
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
the
paragraph
does
not
state
who
specifically
--
who
made
the
observation.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
that
is
what
i’m
suggesting,
mr.
chief
justice.
yes
and
i’m
suggesting
that
for
these
reasons.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that’s
right.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
in
other
words
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
the
burden
of
our
argument
on
that
branch
of
the
case
and
let
me
again
just
say
that
there
are
two
paragraphs
in
the
affidavit
which
states
specifically
that
the
investigators
observed
certain
things.
now
your
question
relates
then
to
the
other
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no
i’m
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
i
say
it
was
typical
and
i
say
that
essentially
our
argument
with
respect
to
this
paragraph
as
with
respect
to
all
of
the
others
which
are
not
specifically
identified
as
to
source,
is
that
no
one
other
than
police
officers
could
possible
or
could
reasonably
be
supposed
to
have
conducted
a
continuing
surveillance
of
this
kind
involving
midnight
observations
of
houses,
4
o’clock
in
the
morning
observations
of
houses
following
cars
back
and
forth
from
one
city
to
another,
looking
into
the
windows
of
parked
cars
but
not
being
themselves
inside
the
car
other
than
police
officers.
i
suppose
you
might
--
it’s
possible
i
suppose
that
some
private
detective
did
it
and
then
later
communicated
his
information
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
by
undercover
men,
you
mean
people
not
regularly
employed?
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well
i
just
don’t
see.
i
don’t
see
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no,
your
honor
because
typically
undercover
men
are
employed
to
get
inside
of
gangs
and
become
part
of
them
and
pretend
to
be
one
of
the
gang,
et
cetera.
and
as
i
was
indicating,
these
observations
and
typically
this
one
which
i
just
read
was
obviously
made
by
someone
who
did
not
have
access
to
the
house
or
to
the
car.
it
was
made
by
someone
who
had
either
followed
the
car
to
garry’s
house
or
who
had
been
posted
outside
the
house
and
waited
for
the
car
to
arrive
or
waited
for
something
to
happen
and
then
took
down
in
careful
detail
what
he
saw.
but
the
vantage
point
was
quite
obviously
that
of
an
outsider
and
as
long
as
you’re
going
to
be
just
an
outsider
hiding
on
the
street
watching
what’s
going
on
in
the
house,
there’s
no
reason
why
you
should
employ
undercover
people
to
do
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
oh,
yes,
your
honor,
certainly.
but
that
there,
of
course,
the
undercover
man
would
be
the
affiant.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
certainly
not.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
no,
i
said
that
he
was
--
in
this
case,
he
wasn’t.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
what
i’ve
suggested
is
that
he
was
an
investigator.
now
i
suppose
and
i
think
that
mr.
mccann
will
argue
that
not
all
investigators
are
reliable,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
one
doesn’t
accept
his
being
a
regular
full
time
police
officer
as
a
sufficient
indication
of
his
reliability
then
the
whole
system
breaks
down
because
that’s
the
only
person
whoever
applies
for
search
warrant.
and
if
one
can’t
accept
even
the
--
if
one
can’t
accept
his
being
an
investigator
is
sufficient
basis
for
believing
him,
then
one
can
never
believe
the
affiant
himself.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
instead
of
an
investigator
told
me.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
well,
i
don’t
know
what
--
if
an
undercover
man
means
a
so-called
special
employee,
i
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
something
like
that.
i
think
we
have
a
weaker
case,
yes.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
yes.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
yes,
you’re
right.
i
agree
with
you.
we
would
have
no
case.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
we
would
have
no
case
with
respect
to
those
paragraphs.
this
is
first
of
our
three
arguments.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
if
that
were
all
--
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
that’s
correct.
mr.
frank
i.
goodman
i
would
agree
with
you.
and
if
that
--
if
all
of
the
–
provided
that
were
all
of
the
information
in
the
case.
now
as
i
said
though
we
also
have
the
two
other
statements
here
wherein
it
states
that
investigators
detected
the
odor
of
fermenting
mash.
and
this
court
indicated
in
the
johnson
case
that
such
olfactory
evidence
or
at
least
it’s
strongly
implied
that
such
olfactory
evidence
would
be
sufficient
to
support
a
search
warrant
provided
that
the
odor
was
distinctive
and
provided
that
the
person
who
detected
it
was
qualified
to
recognized
it.
now
in
the
present
case
no
one
doubts
i
suppose
that
fermenting
mash
has
a
distinctive
odor
or
that
i
suppose
it
wouldn’t
be
doubted
that
investigators
of
the
alcohol
and
tobacco
tax
division
are
qualified
to
recognize
it.
but
finally,
even
if
that
not
be
true,
there
is
no
reason
why
this
information,
these
particular
observations
cannot
be
used
to
corroborate
all
of
the
other
statements
in
the
affidavit
even
assuming
that
those
statements
came
from
a
completely
unknown,
unreliable
or
source
not
shown
to
be
reliable
at
all.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
