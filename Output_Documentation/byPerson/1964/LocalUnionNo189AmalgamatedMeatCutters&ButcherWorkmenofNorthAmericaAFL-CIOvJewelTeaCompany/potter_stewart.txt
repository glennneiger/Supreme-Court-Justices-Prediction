justice
potter
stewart
of
course
on
that
one,
there
is
a
fundamental
dispute
between
the
two
parties
this
controversy
your
--
whether
on
the
other
side
says
there's
a
disclosing
hour,
it
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
hours
or
working
conditions
of
the
butchers.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
continues
here
as
i
read
the
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
which
findings
said
that?
justice
potter
stewart
that
--
that
recital
in
the
district
court's
memorandum
as
it
goes
to
the
motivation
of
the
union
and
i
suppose
when
it
talks
about
the
union
not
working
and
either
the
employees
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
the
fact
is
that
this
early
closing
hour
or
not
has
in
fact
no
impact
at
all
on
the
hours
which
these
butchers
worked
would
the
original
motivation
be
controlling
or
would
the
--
would
the
element
of
the
fact
be
controlling?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
as
i
understand
in
the
--
but
obviously
before
the
days
of
any
self
service
in
order
for
a
meat
market
to
be
open,
there
had
to
be
a
butcher
there.
and
in
the
early
days
of
self
service,
this
was
possibly
also
true
as
i
understand
that
the
claim
release
is
made
nowadays
with
the
improved
technology
of
self
service
in
the
supermarket
it's
not,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
necessary
to
have
a
butcher
present
in
order
to
have
a
meat
market
open,
a
self
service
market
open.
justice
potter
stewart
your
evidence
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
covered
by
the
agreement
too?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
and
so
if
jewel
did
do
this
as
you
say
here,
they'd
be
violating
their
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you'd
have
a
perfectly
good
remedy
against
them.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
the
evidence
by
operations
over
in
indiana.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
back
in
1919
and
indeed
up
until
the
advent
of
self
service,
as
it's
called,
it
was
implicit
in
the
economic
--
in
the
facts
of
the
situation
that
marketing
hours
and
working
hours
were
coterminous.
as
i
understand
it
now,
there
is
some
provision
in
the
agreement
for
working
hours
after
6
p.m.
so
long
as
the
work
is
carried
on
behind
locked
doors.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you're
--
if
the
hours
of
the
labor
are
not
involved
of
the
members
of
your
union
as
would
be
the
case
if
the
employer
is
right,
then
why
is
that
anybody
else's
decision
except
the
employers.
if
you're
right
then
he
can't
do
it.
he
can't
keep
it
open.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
he's
right,
he
can
do
it
without
impinging
in
any
way
on
the
rights
of
your
â€“-
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
--
you're
--
that's
correct
if
this
is
a
working
condition
and
it
is
a
working
condition
only
if
it
in
some
way
affects
the
terms
of
employment
of
your
members,
but
if
he's
right,
it
doesn't
affect
the
terms
of
employment
beyond
that.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
some
awareness
of
antitrust
dangers
wasn't
there
during
the
--?
justice
potter
stewart
this
one
is
the
top
one
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
this
category,
wages,
hours
--
is
this
coterminous
with
the
category
of
what
is
a
subject
of
compulsory
bargaining
under
the
act?
justice
potter
stewart
in
both
cases,
both
the
case
before
us
and
your
hypothetical
case,
that
if
conducted,
that
if
agreed
to
among
employers,
each
would
be
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
law?
justice
potter
stewart
the
present
case
and
your
hypothetical
case.
your
hypothetical
case
maybe
a
little
more
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
difference
of
definition
i
suppose
as
to
what
is
a
working
condition.
in
other
words,
according
to
mr.
dunau's
argument
and
i
think
the
ultimate
conclusion,
the
ultimate
thrust
of
your
argument
is
that
for
instance
railroad
employees
could
say,
now
we're
just
not
going
to
run
any
trains
at
night
and
that
would
be
subject
to
compulsory
bargaining
and
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
the
railroads
thought
gee,
that's
fine,
that
helps
us
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
our
product
market,
terrifically
and
you'll
jump
at
that
and
agree
to
it
that
,that
would
--
would
not
and
could
not
be
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
law.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
[inaudible]
is
not
right.
the
work
is
preparing
the
meat,
cutting
out
the
carcass.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
that
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
have
it
in
their
agreement,
that
only
the
employees
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
only
one
of
two.
the
other
direct
benefit
is
that
these
--
members
of
this
union
simply
do
not
want
to
work
at
night,
none
of
them.
justice
potter
stewart
the
union
doesn't
want
any
employees
to
work
at
night.
justice
potter
stewart
the
agreement
say
--
the
other
--
these
are
the
provisions
of
the
agreement
to
which
you
refer,
what
do
they
say
about
night
work,
if
anything?
justice
potter
stewart
where
does
that
appear
in
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
far
as
the
parties
are
concerned,
this
is
just
a
factual
dispute
because
of
course
the
other
side
said
says
that
it
does
concern
direct
term.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
understand
your
position
and
i
think
you
heard
your
brothers
on
the
other
side
disagree
with
you
and
it's
a
factual
controversy.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
think
everybody
here
agrees
that
if
this
had
been
an
agreement
only
among
employers,
no
union
in
the
picture,
that
this
would
be
clearly
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
law.
so
i
don't
believe
anybody
disagrees
with
that
and
i
don't
see
--
or
maybe
mr.
dunau
perhaps
does.
the
solicitor
general
certainly
agrees
with
you
on
that,
that
if
this
were
only
an
employer
agreement
or
conspiracy,
call
it
what
you
will,
it
would
be
violating
the
antitrust
law.
the
solicitor
general
agrees
with
you
on
that.
justice
potter
stewart
it
only
violates
the
antitrust
laws,
but
the
first
amendment
as
well.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
can
negotiate
with
precise
application
or
workload.
you
can
negotiate
--
justice
potter
stewart
premium
pay
or
the
amount
of
workload
per
hour
or
anything
you
want
to.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
see
that
argument.
i
mean
it's
claimed
that
you
violated
the
antitrust
laws
here
in
this
case
and
i
don't
see
anything
inconsistent
between
that
claim
and
the
claim
that
if
you
didn't
allow
your
men
to
work
after
6
o'clock,
it
would
also
violate
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
don't
see
why
it's
two
horns
of
a
dilemma.
it
seems
to
me
it's
all
in
the
same
directions.
