justice
byron
r.
white
you
suggest
that
a
--
that
a
group
of
employers
who
none
of
whom
is
organized,
does
not
make
an
agreement
saying
that
he
will
look
our
employees
no
more
than
six
hours
a
day
and
none
of
us
will
sell
any
meat
after
6
p.m.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
gave
you
--
i
just
gave
you
what
the
agreement
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
those
--
but
if
they
just
came
to
one
another
and
said
we
will
--
none
of
us
will
somebody
meat
after
six
o'clock.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
--
but
if
--
but
if
--
but
if
a
labor
union
agreed
with
the
law
of
the
employer
unit
that
the
employer
unit
--
no
member
of
the
employer
unit
will
sell
meat
after
six
o'clock
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
unions
there,
is
that
the
extra
fact?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
findings
in
other
butchers
and
other
employees
are
different
but
neither
one
of
the
two
works.
justice
byron
r.
white
based
upon
the
assumption
that
this
kind
of
work,
the
arranging
of
meat
and
replenishing
the
stock
is
butcher's
work.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
all
you
have
to
do
to
insulate
yourself
in
antitrust
law
is
to
make
a
claim
that
this
is
a
matter
relating
to
the
working
conditions
of
this
case
and
all
the
--
all
other
cases
are
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
all
you
say
is
we
have
to
make
a
claim
that
this
is
a
--
related
to
working
condition.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
silly
does
it
have
to
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
silly
does
it
have
to
be
and
who
says
it's
silly,
a
judge
does.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
a
good
faith
claim
then
insulates
them
--
any
union
from
the
antitrust
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
a
good
faith
claim
insulates
it
from
any
kind
of
court
inquiry.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
if
someone
that
is
could
get
you
before
the
labor
board
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
someone
could
get
you
before
the
labor
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
agreements
not
to
deal,
the
employer
agreeing
not
to
deal
with
non-union
establishment,
you
put
that
in
this
category
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
your
brief
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
any
way
you
want
it
to
mean,
but
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
case
where
the
union
is
trying
to
protect
itself
from
the
substandard
conditions
and
--
but
the
agreement
nevertheless
is
not
leveled
--
well,
take
it
--
take
the
agreement
is
in
the
carpenter's
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
question
still
remains
whether
the
labor
relations
act
is
going
to
provide
the
only
remedy.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
suggest
there
was
a
violation
of
antitrust
law
that
one
store,
one
employer
probably
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
all
stores
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
independently
and
the
employer
and
the
union
in
each
case
raises
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
not
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
would
be
if
the
union
doesn't
bargain.
let's
start
with
the
first
store.
if
the
union
agrees
with
the
first
store
and
the
employer
agreed
not
[inaudible]
what
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
he
goes
to
the
second
store
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
two
competitors
don't
have
to
agree
with
each
other
--
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
first
store,
the
employer
agreed
to
close
its
sale
but
the
union
agreed
to
--
not
to
work
for
any
other
stores
that
wouldn't
[inaudible]
agreement.
the
union
is
promised
to
insist
with
every
other
employer.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
really
the
multi-employer
bargaining
that
gets
you
into
trouble.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
agree
with
--
and
one
employer
can
agree
with
one
union
as
--
as
it
will
hold
this
together
as
far
as
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
way
that
you
[inaudible]
to
avoid
[inaudible]
so
he
had
gotten
out
of
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
didn't
want
to
go,
didn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
didn't
want
to
go,
that's
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
didn't
you
go
on
and
say
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
could
that
hurt
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
weren't?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
why
did
you
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
illegal
strike.
you
have
already
admitted
that
one
employer
and
one
union
can
agree
and
bargain
on
whether
to
keep
the
shop
open.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
union,
i
gather,
can
do
--
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
union
were
to
say
that
you
objected
to
this
mulch-employee
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
so
do
i
understand
mr.
christensen
that
if
this
did
concern
direct
terms
wages
or
hours
of
employment,
you
would
concede
that
under
the
laws
that
have
been
developed,
this
could
not
be
a
violation.
