mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
justice
black
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government's
interest
in
this
case
stems
chiefly
from
two
sources.
the
first
it
involves
the
interplay
between
two
major
federal
regulatory
statutes,
which
government
agencies
are
charged
with
administering
and
second,
the
decision
at
least
might
the
issues
certainly
do
have
a
major
impact
upon
the
course
of
collective
bargaining
in
the
united
states
and
it's
for
those
two
reasons
that
we
are
here.
we
are
primarily
concerned
with
the
legal
questions
and
not
with
the
record.
i
may
say
also
by
way
of
introduction
that
as
we
see
this
case,
it's
rarely
a
very
simple
case
provided
that
it
is
decided
in
terms
of
the
issues
necessarily
presented
in
this
case.
it's
sort
of
a
safe
island
if
i
may
put
it
this
way
in
the
midst
of
swamp
which
is
very
foggy
and
very
treacherous.
because
i
think
the
broader
the
proposition
that
it
is
advanced,
the
more
difficult
its
implications
and
the
greater
the
complexity.
we
submit
first
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
does
not
have
primary
jurisdiction
over
cases
alleging
a
violation
of
sherman
act
by
a
contract
or
combination
between
employers
and
a
labor
union.
and
that
there
was
therefore
no
impediment
to
the
courts
below
going
ahead
in
deciding
the
case
on
the
merits
and
no
impediment
here.
our
reasons
are
essentially
very
simple.
first,
we
think
that
congress
has
made
it
plain
that
there
is
no
general
rule
that
every
question
of
interpretation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
must
go
to
the
national
labor
relation
board.
two
illustrations
come
immediately
to
mind.
one
is
section
303
of
the
labor
management
relations
act,
which
as
this
court
held
in
the
juneau
spruce
case
gives
one
injured
by
certain
union
unfair
labor
practices,
a
right
to
sue
for
damages
and
questions
of
interpretation
as
well
as
questions
of
fact
come
up
in
those
cases
and
the
courts
are
charged
with
the
deciding
it.
second,
suits
for
breach
of
contract
under
section
301
often
involve
issues
that
might
go
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
sometimes
involved
and
i
think
will
involve
with
increasing
frequency,
questions
of
interpretation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
i
think
one
case,
i
might
take
the
time
to
use
by
way
of
illustration
in
which
an
employer
sued
contending
that
the
failure
to
give
certain
notices
in
accordance
with
section
8(d)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
automatically
extended
the
contract.
so
he
still
had
a
right
to
enforce
it
and
the
union
contended
that,
that
was
not
the
effect
of
the
section
8(d).
the
court
to
decide
the
case
necessarily
or
almost
necessarily
had
to
become
involved
in
the
interpretation
of
section
8(d)
and
one
can
think
of
and
find
in
the
reports
a
number
of
other
cases
of
that
kind.
so
certainly
the
fact
that
a
question
of
interpreting
some
provision
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
maybe
involved
is
not
alone
enough
to
show
that
there
must
be
primary
jurisdiction.
neither
does
that
necessarily
show
the
reverse.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
involved
--
yes,
it
involved
the
trucking
industry
in
some
way.
i'd
forgotten
that,
but
i
expect
it's
very
close
to
the
point.
our
second
reason
for
thinking
that
there
cannot
be
primary
jurisdiction
here
is
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
simply
does
provide
machinery
for
resolving
this
kind
of
case
in
most
instances.
it
certainly
doesn't
provide
satisfactory
machinery
and
that
is
true
for
three
reasons.
first,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
overwhelming
number
of
combinations
of
employers
or
contracts
between
employers
and
unions
that
might
be
alleged
to
violate
the
sherman
act,
would
not
involve
any
unfair
labor
practice
and
there
is
therefore
no
way
that
anybody
including
the
united
states
could
possibly
take
them
before
the
national
labor
relations
board.
if
i
may
refer
to
the
pennington
case
argued
yesterday
as
an
example,
except
for
the
little
tail
bit
having
to
do
with
the
protective
wage
clause,
i
don't
see
anyway
unless
mr.
roundtree
could
have
taken
that
case
before
the
national
labor
relations
board.
there
was
no
claim
of
any
unfair
labor
practice
by
anyone.
in
this
instance,
the
union's
insistence
upon
this
clause
might
perhaps
have
been
challenged
as
a
refusal
to
bargain,
but
suppose
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
there
might
have
--
but
it
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
there
are
many
instances
in
which
that
couldn't
come
up
and
this
might
be
one.
if
jewel
tea
had
been
willing
to
go
along
with
what
is
said
to
be
a
conspiracy
and
i
can't
believe
that
the
congress
intended
or
that
the
primary
jurisdiction
doctrine
holds
that
when
there
happens
to
be
some
little
incident
of
the
case
that
could
be
challenged
as
a
refusal
to
bargain
collectively,
then
the
whole
matter
in
that
situation
and
that
situation
alone
goes
before
the
labor
board
and
the
case
which
is
95%
the
same
doesn't
involve
that
little
incident,
may
always
go
straight
to
court.
now
there
are
two
other
confirmatory
things
which
seem
to
us
part
of
this
also
they're
not
quite
as
important
as
what
i
said.
one
is
it
that
there's
a
six-month
statute
limitation
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
that's
an
awfully
short
time
for
anyone
to
bring
suit
for
an
alleged
conspiracy
to
violate
the
sherman
act.
indeed,
i'm
afraid
it's
an
impossible
short
time,
unless
you
expect
the
department
of
justice
to
get
around
to
bring
a
suit
for
alleged
violation
of
the
sherman
act
or
i
hate
to
say
it.
again,
another
strong
wind,
after
all,
the
person
injured
by
such
an
alleged
conspiracy
has
no
right
to
have
his
case
determined
by
the
board,
all
he
has
a
right
to
do
is
to
submit
it
to
the
general
counsel.
i
don't
think
that
alone
would
be
enough.
there
are
instances
where
that's
a
complete
barred
of
relief,
but
i
think
it
tends
to
support
in
conjunction
with
the
other
things
what
we
are
saying.
i
turn
then
to
the
other
major
part
of
my
argument,
the
merits.
we
urge
that
upon
the
findings
of
the
district
court
which
we
think
is
supported
by
the
evidence,
the
so-called
marketing-hours
clause
does
not
violate
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
our
argument
has
two
steps.
first,
although
we
say
that
the
restriction
upon
marketing
hours
does
suppress
commercial
competition
among
employers
which
we
acknowledge
is
a
fact,
it
also
yields
direct
benefits
to
employees
represented
by
the
union
in
hours
of
work
and
what
i
will
call
job
protection
in
not
having
their
work
done
by
someone
else
and
that
this
is
what
i
call
a
direct
benefit.
you
get
the
more
convenient
hour
or
you
get
the
work
as
distinguished
from
what
i
would
i
call
the
consequential
benefit
that
flow
in
directly
often
to
union
members
from
a
suppression
of
competition
among
the
employers.
a
price
fixing
agreement
among
employers
may
yield
real
--
very
real
benefits
to
the
union
because
the
employers
to
put
it
colloquially
if
they
get
fat,
the
unions
could
get
higher
wages
from
them
and
if
they
are
lien
then
the
unions
find
it
pretty
hard
to
squeeze
anymore
wages
from
them,
but
that
i
describe
as
an
indirect
benefit.
it
comes
from
the
suppression
of
competition
not
as
the
direct
consequence
of
the
thing
that
you
are
bargaining
about.
we
say
first
that
this
is
such
a
contract
where
the
suppression
of
competition
yields
the
direct
benefit
and
second,
that
such
a
contract
does
not
violate
the
sherman
act.
now
the
first
issue
as
to
what
are
the
facts
here
is
one
that
i
really
shouldn't
concern
myself
about
because
those
who
tried
the
case
and
have
studied
the
record
obviously
are
more
familiar
with
it,
but
i
would
point
out
that
the
district
court
did
find
that
this
restriction
on
marketing
hours
was
imposed
at
arms
length
bargaining
and
was
fashioned
exclusively
by
unions
to
serve
their
own
interest.
how
long
and
what
hours
members
shall
work?
what
work
they
shall
do
and
what
pay
obviously
meaning
what
premiums
for
overtime
they
shall
receive.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
didn't
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
disagree
with
it
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
would
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
would
--
as
i
say,
i
think
anything,
any
observations
i
make
on
this
point
are,
i
should
acknowledge
are
not
based
on
a
complete
study
of
the
record.
it
would
--
it
did
seem
to
us
that
this
finding
was
supported
by
at
least
four
bits
of
evidence.
first,
there
was
the
testimony
of
kelly,
the
union
business
act
at
r-603
and
604,
which
is
unequivocally
to
the
effect
that
you
couldn't
operate
at
night
without
having
meat
cutters
on
duty
or
without
somebody
else
doing
their
work.
there
was
an
operator
of
supermarkets
who
testified
to
that
effect
that
r-415,
460.
there
was
also
the
evidence
of
the
witness
sam
teller
at
r-493
and
495
who
described
his
experience
in
the
store,
where
in
indiana
and
said
that
he
did
get
served
at
night
during
a
time
when
no
employees
were
supposed
to
be
serving.
he
apparently
had
better
luck
than
justice
clark
was
pushing
about.
finally,
there
was
the
course
of
the
negotiations
themselves.
the
district
judge
found
and
i
think
he
was
quite
right
in
finding,
that
the
proposal
for
night
work
without
employees,
without
meat
cutters
on
duty
was
not
interjected
until
the
final
moments
of
the
negotiation
when
they
were
breaking
up.
now
on
that,
it
said
at
page
15
of
the
respondent's
brief,
the
solicitor
general's
brief
misreading
the
overturned
discussion
of
the
district
court,
proceeds
upon
the
erroneous
assumption
that
jewel
proposed
night
operations
without
butchers
being
on
duty
only
on
november
16,
1961
as
negotiations
were
breaking
up.
however,
the
undisputed
record
as
to
1961
is
that
on
september
29,
the
union
asked
what
price
the
employers
would
pay
for
night
operations,
r-596.
i
turn
to
r-596
and
it
said
there
that
the
union
made
certain
--
that
the
employer
made
certain
proposals,
we
want
to
know
what
kind
of
night
operation
we
wanted
--
that
they
wanted.
we
wanted
to
know
about
female
help,
it
sounds
to
me
as
if
somebody
was
going
to
be
on
duty.
we
wanted
to
know
about
the
ratios
for
female
help.
we
want
to
know
what
price
they
would
pay
for
night
operation.
all
of
that
sounds
to
me,
price
is
frequently
used
of
course
when
you
mean
wage.
i
wasn't
there
but
this
at
best
as
ambiguous.
it
certainly
isn't
evidence
that
a
proposal
was
made
for
night
work
without
employees
on
that
occasion.
then
we're
told
on
november
2,
the
industry
as
a
whole
asked
what
the
union
position
would
be
on
night
sales
for
three
nights
a
week.
if
it
was
assumed
that
all
provisions
of
a
contract
had
been
settled
except
marketing
--
at
market
operating
hours,
r-535.
there,
we
do
read
of
a
rather
specific
proposal
made
by
the
employers,
asking
about
certain
assumptions,
what
the
union's
position
was.
one
of
them
was,
the
industry
reached
agreement
to
limit
the
sale
of
fresh
meat
to
three
nights
a
week,
monday,
thursday
and
friday
and
no
saturdays,
that's
two
in
there.
well
now
this
again,
it
seems
to
me
in
view
of
the
fact
that
always
in
the
past,
this
had
involved
employees
working
at
night,
almost
surely
meant
the
same
thing.
it
didn't
mean
night
operations
with
no
employees.
but
if
i'm
wrong
about
that's
not
just
assumption
in
this
instance,
because
if
we
look
at
r-454
--
4
--
554,
r-554,
that's
explained
in
more
detail.
can
you
tell
in
some
detail,
this
was
the
same
employer
with
--
what
kelly
said
in
response
to
your
proposal.
what
proposal
do
you
refer
to?
well,
when
you
asked
him
to
make
that
assumption
that
all
the
conditions
of
the
contract
were
agreed
to
and
the
industry
has
came
in
with
an
offer
of
three
nights
--
three
nights
of
night
operation.
there
wasn't
a
great
deal
of
discussion.
the
purpose
of
asking
those
questions
was
to
find
out,
do
you
want
one
journeyman
on
duty
or
did
he
require
journeyman
on
duty
at
all.
do
you
want
one,
two
or
more?
this
wasn't
night
operation
with
a
guarantee
that
no
one
would
be
there.
then
turning
over
on
the
brief,
we
read
further
negotiations
were
held
on
november
3
and
13.
on
november
13,
jewel
made
the
november
2,
1961
proposal
on
behalf
of
itself
alone,
r-538
and
exhibit
10.
if
you
look
at
exhibit
10,
you
will
see
that
it
was
an
entirely
different
proposal
and
if
you
look
at
r-538,
you
will
find
that
the
witness
was
asked
referring
to
november
13,
did
you
make
this
offer
to
the
union
group
on
that
date?
answer,
no
sir,
we
did
not.
now
i
maybe
--
maybe
they
did
and
maybe
they
didn't,
but
surely
the
district
judge
was
not
on
this
in
taking
jewel
tea's
witness
at
his
own
word,
that
they
did
not
make
the
offer
on
that
date.
and
indeed,
the
same
witness
testified
over
on
r-542
and
r-543
that
the
time
he
gave
it
was
on
november
16,
in
answer
to
mr.
juneau's
question
just
above
the
middle
of
the
page
and
over
on
r-543,
he
said
this
was
at
the
conclusion
of
a
very
long
harassing
day
and
we
were
breaking
up
at
the
time
it
was
given.
i
submit
that
that
is
certainly
evidence
enough
to
support
the
district
judge's
finding
on
this
point
and
that
our
assumption
was
not
unfounded
as
it
said.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
so
far
as
i
can
see.
mr.
archibald
cox
exhibit
10
is
in
the
second
volume.
i'd
say
in
the
form
of
a
letter
from
jewel
tea
and
its
terms
are
quite
different
from
the
terms
of
those
other
proposals
and
the
essential
difference
is
the
difference
between
night
work
with
employees
and
night
work
without
employees.
i
would
make
this
one
other
comment
on
this.
mr.
archibald
cox
one
of
these
suites
apparently
had
been
started
before
those
last
negotiations
if
i
understand
the
record
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
was
some
awareness
of
it.
unquestionably
there
was
awareness.
i
would
make
one
other
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
not
sure
if
it's
this
suit
or
some
other
suit.
mr.
christensen
tells
me
this
suit.
i
would
make
one
other
observation
on
this
part
which
does
not
have
to
do
precisely
with
the
evidence
as
part
of
the
finding.
and
while
i
--
the
matter
did
get
under
my
skin
enough
to
look
at
the
record
on
those
points
again,
i
don't
want
to
assert
more
knowledge
than
i
have
and
obviously
these
gentlemen
know
more
about
the
record
as
does
mr.
christensen.
the
observation
i
would
make
is
simply
this.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
issue
before
the
district
court
and
the
issue
in
a
sense
here
is
not
whether
jewel
tea
can
run
a
store,
selling
meat
at
night
without
any
employees
handling
the
meat.
the
finding
is
this
is
a
charge
of
conspiracy
between
employers
and
the
union
and
the
finding
is
that
the
employers
and
the
union
conceived
this
problem
in
terms
that
you
either
had
employees
working
at
night
or
you
didn't
have
those
marketing
hours.
and
the
question
i
think
is
whether
they
were
acting
honestly
with
a
substantial
basis
and
whether
they
were
entitled
to
bargain
about
the
problem
and
the
terms
in
which
they
seriously
and
substantially
saw
it
without
being
charged
with
conspiracy
rather
than
what
the
absolute
truth
is
because
surely
the
freedom
to
bargain
about
wages
and
other
direct
benefits
to
employees
allows
the
parties
some
freedom
to
appraise
the
facts
and
to
act
on
the
basis
of
their
appraisal
of
the
fact,
provided
that
it's
done
seriously,
in
good
faith
with
some
kind
of
a
substantial
basis,
now
i
come
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
that
--
i
think
that
i
will
answer
that
in
the
course
of
my
argument
on
the
law
in
part
justice
black,
but
there
are
certain
issues
where
i
think
that,
that
would
have
to
be,
certain
cases
where
i
think
that
would
have
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
now
i
do
want
to
suggest
one
distinction
which
was
not
entirely
clear
in
some
of
the
colloquy
during
mr.
dunau's
argument.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
not
what
a
union
can
do
alone.
that
would
be
norris-laguardia
act
case.
we're
talking
here
of
course
about
contracts
and
combinations,
that
the
two
are
not
necessarily
the
same.
now
i
come
--
i'm
afraid
somewhat
belatedly
to
the
legal
issue.
as
we
see
it,
we
start
from
this
premise
which
is
not
directly
applicable
to
the
case
but
it's
a
necessary
foundation.
and
that
is
that
a
group
of
employers
and
a
union
do
not
violate
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
when
they
enter
into
an
agreement
or
call
it
a
combination
or
conspiracy,
when
they
enter
into
an
agreement
upon
wages
or
hours
of
employment
and
other
direct
benefits
to
the
union
which
have
no
effect
upon
competition
and
the
producer's
market,
the
selling
market,
except
as
a
consequence
of
eliminating
differences
in
wage
cost
as
a
source
of
competition.
mr.
archibald
cox
no
sir
and
you'll
note
that
my
proposition
is
for
the
moment
quite
narrow.
i'm
speaking
for
the
moment
only
of
the
case
in
which
the
sole
impact
on
commercial
competition
as
justice
stone
called
it,
or
competition
in
the
selling
market
as
i
call
it,
is
indirect
because
of
the
standardization
of
labor
cost.
that's
the
case
of
every
wage
agreement.
there
are
very
marked
consequences,
but
they're
indirect
consequences
of
the
standardization
of
labor
cost
and
we
say
that
those
effects
on
competition
are
not
enough
to
invalidate
bargaining
about
wages
or
about
hours
or
other
things
that
enter
into
labor
cost.
we
think
this
follows
--
is
supported
by
two
considerations.
first,
we
think
as
justice
stone
reasoned
in
the
apex
case
that
this
is
simply
not
the
kind
of
contract
in
restraint
of
trade
that
the
sherman
act
referred
to
in
using
a
word
of
art,
that
it
was
talking
about
restrictions
on
market
practices
and
that
wages,
the
labor
market
does
not
come
under
that
count.
second,
we
think
that
the
national
policy
from
the
clayton
act,
down
through
a
whole
host
of
enactments
including
the
walsh-healey
act
and
the
davis-bacon
act,
makes
it
plain
that
it
is
not
national
policy
to
encourage
competition
based
on
differences
in
labor
standards.
indeed,
i'll
go
a
step
further
and
say
that
the
kind
of
collective
bargaining,
we
have
had
for
half
a
century,
but
increasingly
since
1935,
simply
could
not
take
place
if
effects
on
the
marketing
of
goods
stemming
from
the
standardization
of
labor
cost
were
enough
to
constitute
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
every
national
union
and
surely
our
collective
bargaining
has
been
founded
on
national
union,
looks
to
the
standardization
of
labor
cost.
now
i
want
to
note
in
passing
one
qualification
and
one
corollary
to
that
proposition.
the
qualification
is
that
if
it
is
shown
that
the
agreement
on
wages,
the
combination
for
wages
was
entered
into
because
the
union
was
seeking
to
aid
an
independent
conspiracy
of
employers
to
suppress
competition
and
that
is
shown
by
other
evidence,
admissions
if
you
will
or
something
like
that,
that
then
we
would
make
that
an
exception
to
our
proposition.
the
philadelphia
photo
engravers
case
cited
in
my
brief
seems
a
satisfactory
example
and
we
would
also
say
as
a
corollary
to
the
proposition
that
simply
the
fact
that
the
union
and
the
employers
knew
that
a
sharp
increase
in
wages,
coupled
with
an
effort
to
extend
it
through
the
industry
would
result
in
the
elimination
of
marginal
firms
is
not
enough
to
deprive
them
of
the
immunity
privilege,
not
enough
to
put
it
under
the
sherman
act.
after
all,
to
say
otherwise
would
simply
mean
that
people
who
bargain
without
considering
the
economic
effect
are
not
under
the
sherman
act,
that
people
who
consider
all
the
economic
consequences
would
violate
the
sherman
act.
and
we
think
to
bring
a
case
within
the
exception
that
i
stated,
that
there
must
be
some
other
evidence
than
that
of
the
negotiations
and
the
agreement
on
the
subject
of
wages.
now
that
is
not
quite
this
case
and
i
simply
stated
that
proposition
as
the
foundation.
this
case
differs,
because
this
agreement
i
think
indisputably
does
restrain
commercial
competition.
it
does
eliminate
competition
based
on
differences
in
hours
and
if
this
were
an
agreement
between
the
employers
alone,
the
government's
view
would
be
that
it
violated
section
1
of
the
sherman
act,
if
nothing
more
than
it
appears
here.
nevertheless,
we
think
that
what
you
have
on
the
finding
is
a
situation
in
which
again
justice
stewart
direct
benefits
to
the
employees
and
i
wouldn't
agree
as
you
know
that
the
phrase
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
was
limited
to
direct
benefits,
that
you
must
bargain
with
that,
that
where
direct
benefits
to
the
employee
are
one
side
of
the
coin
and
the
restriction
on
commercial
competition
is
the
other
side
of
the
coin
and
the
two
are
as
inseparably
linked
as
we
take
them
to
be
on
the
findings
and
as
the
two
sides
of
the
coin
are
then
the
principle
that
i
stated
a
moment
ago
extends
to
the
case
and
my
reasons
are
much
the
same
as
in
the
first
instant.
the
first
reason
that
it's
not
the
kind
of
contract
isn't
applicable,
but
the
second
reason
i
think,
the
policy
of
the
labor
laws
is
applicable,
because
there
are
a
considerable
number,
we've
cited
them
in
our
brief,
of
things
that
are
traditionally
are
parts
of
collective
bargaining
and
the
essence
of
the
collective
bargaining,
which
both
yield
direct
benefits
to
the
employees
and
also
involve
a
restriction
on
commercial
competition.
the
so-called
featherbedding
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
don't
think
i
do.
i
would
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i'm
afraid
--
really
your
phrase
could
mean
so
many
things
that
i'm
not
sure
of
what
you
have
in
mind
about
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
if
you
mean
that
an
employer
agrees
not
to
deal
with
any
non-union
establishments,
even
so
the
non-union
establishment
is
paying
higher
wages
than
the
union
establishment
and
there
is
a
no
benefit
to
the
employees
in
terms
of
wages,
i
would
say
quite
clearly.
in
first
place
it
isn't
a
direct
benefit
as
stated
by
proposition.
in
the
second
place
it's
arguable
that
there's
no
benefit
at
all
except
by
suppressing
competition
among
the
employers
and
we
have
the
major
difference
between
us
and
the
afl-cio
and
the
petitioners
here
is
our
insistence
that
for
present
purposes,
anything
laid
down
in
favor
of
the
petitioners
here
should
be
limited,
we
think
to
an
instance
where
there
are
direct
benefits
to
the
employees
on
whose
behalf
the
union
is
bargaining.
now
there
are
a
number
of
cases
where
we
differ
very
sharply,
i'm
not
sure
what
they
all
are
and
quite
frankly
regard
this
as
very
difficult
and
treacherous
deal,
but
i
can
think
of
three
cases
where
there
are
marked
differences
between
our
view
and
the
union's
view.
i
think
perhaps
your
case
comes
fairly
close
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
don't
understand
that
the
agreement
in
the
carpenter's
case
was
limited
to
substandard
condition.
in
the
second
place,
i
don't
think
that
this
problem
of
the
secondary
boycott
in
terms
of
the
antitrust
laws
is
a
very
real
problem
today
because
it
is
taken
care
of
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
real
problems
if
i
might
take
just
a
minute
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
it
--
one
could
sue
for
damages.
if
i
remember
it
correctly,
it
isn't
limited
to
filing
unfair
labor
practice
charges.i
suppose
there
is
a
question
in
theory
whether
there
are
triple
damages.
i
would
apply
justice
white,
the
same
test
that
we
have
stated.
if
what
the
union,
to
take
--
put
one
example,
if
the
union
says
“we
object
to
your
buying
parts
rather
than
making
them
through
your
own
employees
i
would
say
that
a
promise
not
to
subcontract
was
a
direct
benefit
because
it
provides
no
jobs.”
if
the
union,
instead
of
doing
that,
asks
only
for
a
clause
that
would
protect
its
wages,
asked
the
employer
to
promise
that
he
will
not
subcontract
parts
that
might
be
made
in
his
shop
to
any
other
contractor
who
might
make
lower
wage
cost,
i
would
say
that,
that
too
was
a
direct
benefit
to
the
employees.
if
you
want
to
take
a
case
like
carpenter's
case
or
the
allen
bradley
case
where
the
union
was
trying
to
do
much
more
than
that,
where
it
was
trying
to
protect
its
wages
by
keeping
all
goods
out
of
the
area
so
that
the
employers
would
get
fat
or
if
it
is
bargaining
on
two
levels,
the
installation
people
and
the
production
people,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
benefit
maybe
only
indirect
and
it
would
fall
in
the
category
of
cases
that
we
think
the
court
should
avoid.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
agree
that
those
have
been
very
difficult
phrases
in
the
law
on
many
occasions.
it
might
--
i
think
that
one
might
well
conclude
that,
that
was
not
a
satisfactory
standard,
but
if
i
might
take
time
to
put
a
couple
of
examples,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
court
would
do
well
not
to
announce
a
broader
rule
in
a
case
that
doesn't
require
it.
and
let
me
put
your
honor
if
i
may,
a
few
--
just
a
couple
of
illustrations.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
suppose
so.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
suppose
so.
i
think
that
all
these
lines
get
close
and
as
i
say,
i
don't
offer
this
as
a
--
sure
all
that
can
be
applied
willingly,
but
there
is
a
marked
difference.
let's
suppose
for
example
that
the
union
construction
laborers
on
highway
construction
find
that
it's
getting
increasingly
difficult
to
negotiate
any
wage
increases
in
ohio,
on
highway
construction,
because
there
is
competitive
bidding
among
the
contractors,
cutting
their
bids
so
low
that
they
aren't
able
to
pay
any
wage
increase.
so
the
union
goes
to
them
and
says,
we're
going
to
strike
unless
you
fellows
enter
into
a
scheme
whereby
who
will
bid
is
allocated
for
each
job
or
they
might
propose
a
geographical
allocation
as
is
sometimes
said
to
have
happened
among
the
roofing
unit,
that
case
while
this
does
stem
from
the
union's
self-interest,
and
while
it
maybe
arguable
whether
the
hutcheson
doctrine
doesn't
immunize
it,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
employers
capitulate
and
agree
with
the
union
in
that
case,
where
the
benefit
to
the
union
comes
from
the
fact
of
having
suppressed
competition
among
employers
and
thereby
enables
them
later
to
get
something
more,
is
a
distinguishable
case
from
this
kind.
indeed,
i
would
say
that,
that
kind
of
case
differs
from
the
kind
of
cases
that
we
see
here
in
three
important
respects.
first,
this
sort
of
thing
isn't
traditionally
the
heart
of
collective
bargaining.
it
isn't
essential
to
effective
collective
bargaining
and
this
sort
of
restraint
would
clearly
be
illegal
if
it
were
imposed
by
an
employer.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
that's
true,
that
difference
is
true,
that
factor
is
true.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
i
overstated
it
there.
but
it
does
seem
that
it's
an
effect
on
the
market,
on
the
public,
is
quite
different
in
degree
at
least
in
this
kind
of
case,
in
terms
of
the
kind
of
danger
it
offers
and
we
would
think
that
the
court
could
reserve
judgment
on
that
kind
of
a
case
without
prejudicing
one
way
or
the
other
and
still
reverse
the
judgment
in
this
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
think
the
distinction
drawn
--
i
think
i
have
to
draw
two
conclusions
from
that
sentence.
first,
i
think
that
the
--
that
this
in
a
way
tends
to
confirm
the
view
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
overrule
the
factual
findings
of
the
district
court
because
you
will
note
that
the
court
of
appeals
here
spoke
of
including
the
number
of
hours
per
day
which
anyone
shall
be
required
to
work.
he
did
not
speak
of
the
hours
in
the
day
when
one
should
be
required
to
work
and
that
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
employer
is
bound
to
respect
the
employees'
interests
in
what
hour
--
in
what
hours
of
the
day
he
works
in.
second
i
would
say
that
the
national
--
mr.
archibald
cox
perhaps
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
i
think
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
of
course,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true,
but
of
course
how
the
business
shall
operate
and
what
the
employees
do,
what
their
conditions
are,
is
involved
in
every
question,
what
wage
you
pay
has
something
to
do
with
how
the
business
shall
operate.
now
the
steel
companies
say
that
raising
wages
prevents
them
from
setting
aside
sufficient
reserves
to
replace
their
plant.
what
premium
you
get
if
you
work
at
night
or
whether
you
get
double
time
if
you
work
on
sundays,
all
has
a
bearing
on
how
the
business
will
operate
and
when
it
will
be
opened
and
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
in
our
view
unequivocally
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
i
think
the
point
that
comes
in
here
which
perhaps
i
missed
in
first
answering
your
question
and
the
point
that
would
come
in,
in
the
railroad
case,
is
that
the
employees
not
only
are
interested
in
at
what
time
of
day
they
work,
they
are
interested
in
whether
they
have
work
to
do
and
if
the
employer
sells
all
his
meat
at
night
when
they
don't
want
to
work,
there
won't
be
any
work
for
them
to
do
in
the
daytime.
so
they
have
to
do
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
and
putting
it
on
the
--
the
particular
work
we're
talking
about
here
is
when
all
the
hamburger
is
gone,
putting
some
more
on
the
shelves.
and
my
observation
is
that
there
are
never
very
much
hamburger
on
the
shelves
as
it
is
–
there
is
some
there,
but
it
has
to
be
replenished
all
the
time.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
the
safeway
shelves
in
my
case
mr.
justice
black.[laughter]
you
are
quite
right
it
isn't
the
selling
and
i
used
--
spoke
the
term
to
--
spoke
too
broadly,
but
there
is
a
problem
here.
it's
not
just
the
one
problem
when
the
employees
work.
it
is
also
a
problem
of
job
protection
of
the
work
jurisdiction
and
of
course
this
problem
between
the
clerk
--
the
meat
cutters
is
also
--
follow
these
things
now
is
an
ancient
and
troublesome
problem.

that's
something
that
these
people
are
very
sensitive
and
jealous.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
another
thing
justice
stewart
that
almost
anyone
who
follows
these
things
would
tell
you
that
these
promises
and
agreements
are
not
available
out
of
protection.
in
fact,
you
will
find
a
great
many
employers
who
make
inconsistent
promises
on
this
subject
and
there's
a
devil
to
enforce.
so
i
really
don't
think
the
theoretical
protection
of
the
promise
can
fairly
be
regarded
as
the
end
of
that
promise.
