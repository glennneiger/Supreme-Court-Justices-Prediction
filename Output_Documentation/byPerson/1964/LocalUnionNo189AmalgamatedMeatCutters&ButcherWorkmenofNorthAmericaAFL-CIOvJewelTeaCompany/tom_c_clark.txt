[inaudible][attempt
to
laughter]

you
shut
the
whole
market
down?
justice
tom
c.
clark
why

c.
clark

this
suit?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
didn't

justice
tom
c.
clark
i
thought
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
sale
after

on
the
self-help
would
be
prepared
by
the
union,
wouldn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark

--
justice
tom
c.
clark
[inaudible]
make
up
during
the
daytime
with
additional
help
but
â€“
the
use
of
knife,
it
wouldn't
harm
anything,
would
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
i
guess
i
don't
get
your
question,
i
don't
get
it.[laughter]
