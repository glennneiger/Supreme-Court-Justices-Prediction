mr.
george
b.
christensen
may
it
please
the
court.
having
heard
our
position
described
by
three
different
sets
of
lawyers
and
variously
described,
i'm
delighted
of
an
opportunity
of
stating
it
myself.
now
i
would
be
pretty
timid
expressing
any
difference
as
to
the
law
with
the
solicitor
general
because
his
excellence
in
this
field
is
well
known.
i
don't
feel
that
timidity
however
in
discussing
the
record,
because
i
doubt
that
the
solicitor
general
would
have
gotten
into
this
case,
had
he
been
as
fully
familiar
with
it
last
summer
as
he
was
at
this
time
for
what
he
seeks
to
do.
as
the
discussion
has
demonstrated
during
the
last
15
minutes
is
to
build
a
tremendous
inverted
pyramid
of
the
law
in
all
scopes
and
fields
upon
a
very
narrow
point
and
he
isn't
quite
sure
where
that
point
lies.
and
i
think
i
can
demonstrate
that.
he
says
this
morning
that
the
--
this
clause
restricting
market
operating
hours
which
is
conceded
to
be
an
unreasonable
restraint
on
trade,
is
a
direct
benefit
to
labor
and
therefore
exempt
and
the
direct
benefit
that
he
now
finds
is
that
it
prevents
others
from
doing
the
work.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
they
got
to
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
let's
clear
one
thing
out
of
this
case
once
and
for
all.
an
examination
of
these
contracts
discloses
the
most
elaborate
provisions
as
to
hours
butchers
shall
work
as
to
premium
pay
they
shall
get,
as
to
schedules,
it
provides
for
over
time
that
may
work
--
may
run
after
the
marketing
hours,
may
start
ahead
of
the
marketing
hours.
everything
they
possibly
could
have
they
have
without
this
restraint
and
there
isn't
any
way
that,
that
can
be
changed
except
by
their
agreement.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
oh,
they
can
work
at
such
hours.
they're
quoted
--
you'll
find
contract
is
set
forth,
they're
too
long.
they
can
work
--
they
can
start
work
at
any
time
after
8
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
work
as
late
at
night
as
the
operator
wishes
them
to
work,
provided
they're
paid
their
premium
pay
that
applies
to
the
particular
time.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
that
will
appear
in
both
exhibits
1
and
2
and
the
whole
matter
is
set
forth
record
49,
49
of
volume
1
your
honor
and
there
isn't
one
faint
shred
of
doubt
about
that.
there
are
working
hours,
there
are
two
contracts
attached
to
the
complaint.
one
is
the
so-called
service
contract
and
the
other
the
self-service
and
the
one
that
i
am
referring
to
at
49
is
the
self-service.
mr.
george
b.
christensen

what?

george

christensen

--

mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes,
but
so
far
as
hours
of
work
are
concerned.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no,
or
any
other
arrangement
obviously
that
they
want
to
have
as
hours
they
can
work.
these
hours
of
work
were
satisfactory
too.
they
can
have
other
things.
we
have
to
bargain
on
that,
there
is
no
issue
on
that
in
this
case.
now
the
second
benefit
that
these
people
are
supposed
to
get
--
well
the
first
one
is,
is
that
it
prevents
others
from
doing
the
work
and
it's
been
repeatedly
pointed
out
here.
it's
presumed
that
these
contracts
are
enforceable.
now
the
solicitor
general
says,
oh
well,
they're
violative.
well
now
he
says
that
the
district
court
found,
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
it
contrary
and
let
me
tell
you
what
the
record
is
on
that
and
this
i
think
i
can
speak
with
some
authority
on.
of
course,
the
chief
business
agent
from
the
union
got
up
and
said,
“well,
we
find
that
someone
is
always
moving
delicatessen
items
around.”
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
we
have
been
operating
in
indiana
in
an
intensely
congested
area
for
several
years,
most
of
the
stores,
six
nights
a
week
until
9
o'clock
and
some
of
them
until
11,
with
butchers
on
duty
only
for
two
nights.
so
that
there
is
ample
opportunity
for
cheating
if
cheating
goes
on.
in
their
entire
history,
they
couldn't
come
up
with
a
single
bit
of
evidence
surely
and
so
finally
in
the
middle
of
the
trial,
they
sent
out
a
disgruntled
former
employee
that
we
found
engaging
in
unsatisfactory
work
practices.
he
was
adulterating
hamburger
and
he
got
a
black
mark
on
his
record.
if
you
want
to
read
something
when
you
get
time
you
read
about
this
prized
witness
mr.
sander
and
his
confession.
that's
exhibit
10,
i've
lost
--
that's
not
exhibit
10,
that's
--
just
one
second,
because
you
might
as
well
get
some
enjoyment
out
of
the
case
as
i
have
worked
hard
on
it.
in
any
event,
i
don't
find
it
right
at
the
moment.
he
went
to
three
stores
in
that
indiana
area,
on
a
night
when
no
butchers
were
on
duty,
he
went
there
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
finding
what
was
going
on.
at
the
first
store,
1755
and
again
at
6900
indianapolis,
the
second
store
“did
you
spy
around
and
see
if
you
could
get
someone
to
give
you
some
service?”
“yes,
i
did,”
“and
you
were
unable?”
“that
is
correct.”
he
got
to
the
third
store
and
he
found
not
two
grocery
clerks.
i
read
from
record
499.
he
got
to
the
third
store
and
you
find
out
on
record
495
and
he
didn't
get
two
grocery
clerks.
he
got
a
meat
apprentice
who
was
is
in
the
back
room
working
on
meat
and
he
got
this
fellow
to
bring
out
the
rump
roast
and
he
induced
the
kid
to
show
it
to
him
and
then
he
put
it
down
somewhere
else
and
walked
off.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
is
not
a
single
bit
of
evidence,
objective
evidence
in
this
record
of
any
bona
fide
customer
in
illinois,
indiana
or
elsewhere
ever
having
been
given
this
special
service.
and
this
is
all
under
contracts
that
have
elaborate
grievance
procedure
in
them
and
i
am
sure
the
members
of
this
court
know
that
if
there
had
been
any
substantial
breach,
these
aggressive
unions
would
have
had
us
in
arbitration
after
arbitration.
the
last
time
i
was
before
this
court
was
in
a
case
that
involved
grievances
over
$2.19,
the
sinclair-atkinson
thing
was
spawned
out
of
such
a
thing.
now
it
is
just
idiotic
to
contend
that
these
contracts
aren't
enforceable
or
that
there
is
any
amount
of
cheating.
the
real
temptation
for
cheating
is
in
the
situation
today
when
people
can't
get
meat
and
when
store
manager
would
like
to
break
his
arm
if
he
could
to
satisfy
a
customer
who
can
get
no
meat
at
all.
now
it
very
well
maybe
the
district
that
they
offered
evidence
that
it's
not
a
satisfactory
way
to
operate
a
store.
it
very
well
maybe
that
we
would
prefer
if
we
could
to
have
the
services
of
butchers
at
night,
but
the
day
has
not
yet
come
when
if
we
want
to
run
what
they
think
is
an
unsatisfactory
store,
we
can't
run
it
that
way.
our
customers
don't
object.
the
evidence
proves
that
out
in
indiana
that
the
evening
sale
of
meat
with
respect
to
the
sale
of
groceries
is
at
the
same
ratio
as
the
day
time
sale
when
butchers
are
on
duty.
but
whether
that
be
right
or
wrong,
so
long
as
we
don't
make
people
work
when
they
don't
want
and
they
can
bargain
and
say
we
won't
work
past
6
o'clock
at
night
they
can't
restraint
trade
to
the
extent
of
saying,
“you,
mr.
merchant
cannot
allow
the
public
to
come
in
the
store
and
pick
up
that
meat
on
which
we
have
fully
completed
our
task.”
now
the
issue
is
a
very
simple
one.
there
is
no
question
here
of
anyone
taking
anyone
else's
work.
there
is
no
question
here
of
compelling
men
to
work
when
they
don't
want
to.
you
can,
of
course,
given
an
exaggerated
reading
to
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
but
you
will
observe
the
court
of
appeals
rendered
two
opinions
in
this
case
and
in
the
second
opinion,
it
went
back
and
it
re-adapted
the
first
one
and
in
the
first
opinion,
it
described
these
contracts.
it
described
the
restraining
provision
and
it
then
went
on
and
i
think
the
line
is
significant,
after
describing
the
restraining
provision,
which
prevents
the
public
from
buying
from
self-service
cases
at
night.
it
says
that
the
remaining
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract
concern
hours,
wages
and
conditions
of
employment
and
it
is
precisely
that
thought
that
runs
through
both
opinions
and
it
is
precisely
that
line
that
we
think
governs
the
decision
that
should
be
made
upon
this
appeal.
the
court
did
overturn
the
district
court's
findings
of
fact
or
example,
and
it
was
required
to.
when
you
have
a
record
of
successful
operations
without
butchers
on
duty
in
indiana
and
without
cheating
except
this
instance
of
entrapment
or
a
court
to
say
that
it
isn't
practical
to
operate
a
store
that
way
is
obviously
contrary
to
the
record,
even
though
the
court
was
entitled,
should
be
entitled
to
tell
a
merchant
how
to
run
the
stores.
it's
none
of
the
court's
business.
if
we
want
to
run
an
unsatisfactory
store,
we
do
so
at
the
risk
of
customer
disapproval.
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
in
its
first
opinion
whether
one
form
of
merchandising
or
the
other
is
the
best
will
be
determined
by
the
customer.
that
is
the
precise
object
as
i
understand
it.
the
sherman
act
is
aimed
at
is
to
let
competition
find
the
level
it
should
be
at,
let
the
public
determine
from
the
various
acts
of
the
competitors
what
should
be
done.
now,
the
court
said
that
we
can
set
operating
hours,
but
it
soften
that
language
and
you
will
find
in
the
second
opinion
on
the
same
page
as
mr.
justice
black
read
from.
it
said
furnishing
of
suitable
hours
is
the
prerogative
of
the
management.
we
can
furnish
suitable
hours.
we
have
that
right.
no
one
can
tell
us
or
should
be
able
to
tell
us
what
hours
we
furnish.
we
can't
make
the
men
work.
we
can't
make
them
work
in
the
daytime
if
they
don't
want
to.
we
must
secure
their
agreement
to
that.
but
they
say,
“you
can't
let
anyone
pick
up
that
meat
on
which
we
have
fully
performed
our
task.”
when
they
step
over
there
they
are
not
engaging
in
fixing
a
term
or
a
condition
of
employment
at
all.
the
labor
exemption
isn't
a
matter
to
be
determined
by
theories
or
by
what
we
may
think
in
this
courtroom
is
a
desirable
state
of
the
law.
the
sherman
act
forbids
all
contracts,
all
restraints
of
trade
and
the
exemption
from
it
can
come
only
in
two
places.
it
must
come
either
from
the
clayton
act
or
it
must
come
from
norris-laguardia
and
either
way,
you
read,
any
way
you
read
those
statutes
it's
limited
to
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
one
says
terms
and
conditions
and
the
other
says,
terms
or
conditions
and
unless
you
can
come
within
that
language
is
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
then
is
this
admitted
restraint
of
trade
necessarily
falls
under
the
sherman
act.
i
think
this
case
is
an
atypical
case.
this
type
of
retailing
operation
is
different
from
a
great
many
retailing
operations.
of
course
it's
far
different
from
the
operation
of
a
railroad
where
the
railroad
can't
run
at
all
if
there
isn't
someone
up
there
running
the
machinery.
and
to
attempt
to
expand
from
these
peculiar
and
rather
narrow
facts
into
the
entire
field
of
antitrust
law,
gets
us
into
these
perplexing
problems.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
think
it's
a
rather
analogous
situation
and
you're
getting
something
close
to
stand
by
musicians
and
that
kind
of
thing.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
don't
think
they
could
say
you've
got
to
shutdown.
they
might
insist
on
a
little
featherbedding
within
and
without
the
law
and
i'd
rather
not
commit
myself
on
that
without
thinking
it
out,
but
as
to
saying,
you've
to
shut
that
factory
down,
i
would
think
that's
the
same
--
roughly
the
same
situation
here
as
i
now
understand
the
problem.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
we
don't
have
mechanization.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
the
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
certainly,
certainly.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
this
is
not
inaccurate
analogy,
but
it's
--
and
i
don't
think
that
mr.
justice
goldberg
asserted
that
it
was
along
--
but
it's
a
problem
along
the
same
lines.
we
don't
have
any
mechanization
here.
this
meat
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
wouldn't
harm
them
at
all,
wouldn't
harm
them
at
all,
make
more
work
for
them.
the
workload
of
any
butcher
of
course
is
a
bargainable
matter.
there's
no
issue
on
that.
if
we
are
working
the
men
too
hard,
they
can
easily
say
a
man
shall
not
be
required
--
and
i
don't
know
enough
about
the
business
to
say
whether
you
express
it
in
pounds
or
tons
or
carcasses,
but
a
workload
is
a
bargainable
matter
and
that
can
be
taken
care
of.
so
that
you
have
here
a
rather
unique
situation
in
which
any
legitimate
objective
of
the
union
can
be
achieved
by
the
contracts
through
ordinary
labor
provisions,
in
fact
were
achieved
in
these
contracts
without
this
restraint
and
all
that
is
at
issue
is
whether
some
poor
shopper
like
justice
clark
can
go
in
one
of
our
stores
in
chicago
at
night
and
get
himself
a
piece
of
meat.
it's
--
now,
you
can.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
of
course
i
don't
regard
that
as
out
of
the
case.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
talks
about
that
for
me.
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
says
that
there
is
ample
evidence
in
here
and
they
reversed
the
case
and
said
there
should
be
a
trial
as
to
associate
it.
there's
an
expressed
finding
on
it.
now
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
it
puts
him
right
in
the
middle
of
it.
it
puts
him
right
in
the
middle
of
it
and
for
this
reason.
what
you
were
saying
is
that
a
union
can
always
insist
that
the
least
efficient
producer
be
kept
in
business
because
his
employees
might
lose
their
job
there
and
have
to
work
elsewhere,
and
there
have
been
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
that's
correct.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
correct.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
correct.
and
i
think
that
follows
very,
very
simply.
people
overlook
the
breadth
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
it's
conceded
here
as
i
understand
it
that
if
this
restraint
was
issued,
entered
into
by
a
businessman
alone,
the
solicitor
general
makes
it
very
clear
that
this
would
be
an
obvious
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
if
we
did
it
alone,
we
would
be
in
trouble.
we
would
be
subject
to
criminal
indictment,
whatever
penalties
--
other
penalties
should
apply.
it's
said
that
norris-laguardia
takes
the
unions
out
of
this,
it
is
the
contention
mr.
dunau
is
making,
but
let
me
read
norris-laguardia,
section
13.
when
used
in
this
act,
a
case
shall
be
held
to
involve
or
to
grow
out
of
a
dispute
when
the
case
involves
persons
who
are
engaged
in
the
same
industry
or
have
direct
or
indirect
interest
therein,
or
who
are
members
of
the
same
or
an
affiliated
organization
of
employers,
whether
such
dispute
is
between
one
or
more
employers
or
associations
of
employers
and
one
or
more
employers
or
associations
of
employers.
i
did
not
misspeak.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
now
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
oh!
no,
i
wouldn't
think
that.
he
doesn't
have
to.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yeah.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
yes,
i
would
then.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
would
think
there
was
a
violation.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
there
would
be.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
would
be.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
don't
think
that,
that
would
be.
you
wouldn't
have
any
impact
upon
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
don't
know
precisely
where
you
would
draw
the
line,
but
you
can't
go
very
far.
the
minute
you
get
two
competitors,
i
think
for
the
second
store,
you
would
do
it.
now
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
oh,
i
understand,
and
they
don't
have
to.
they
take
conscious
parallel
action
they
are
in
trouble.
now,
you
only
have
part
of
the
facts
in
your
employer,
but
the
union
must
have
some
purpose
in
doing
it
as
we
have
seen
if
the
rest
of
the
contract
is
like
this
one.
it's
not
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
it's
not
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
oh!
then
i
think
you'd
be
right
back
in
violation
of
the
law
as
you
are
now,
as
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
think
so.
you
aren't
going
to
be
engaged
--
one
employer
can
do
as
he
wishes
to,
but
it's
--
and
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
oh!
i
would
think
so,
unless
they
had
--
the
only
store
in
the
town,
i'd
want
to
know
a
lot
more
facts
before
i'd
want
to
be
bound
hand
and
foot
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
that's
when
the
case
comes
to
trouble
just
as
you
have
a
lot
of
antitrust
violations
when
everyone
is
happy
with
them.
they
never
come
to
light
and
nothing
is
done
with
it.
it
doesn't
mean
that
--
it
doesn't
have
very
much
to
do
with
whether
it's
legal
arrangement
or
illegal.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
we
tried.
they
said
we
were
unethical.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
what?
mr.
george
b.
christensen
oh,
that
isn't
so.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
we
withdrew
from
the
unit
by
--
to
this
extent
of
offering
different
terms
and
conditions
and
insisting
on
a
vote
on
it.
we
didn't
to
that
extent
we
weren't
a
part
of
this
group
that
was
bargaining
together.
you'll
find
in
the
record,
and
i
think
that
i
quoted
that
in
our
brief.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well
no
wait
because
we
would
have
had
--
we
would
have
been
struck
here.
this
is
a
--
foot
of
page
17
of
our
brief,
it's
in
the
white
cover.
we
tried
to
give
him
a
proposition
to
stay
open.
we
insisted
that
it
go
to
a
vote.
they
took
a
vote,
voted
to
strike,
and
the
union
took
the
position,
the
union
and
the
industry
would
conform
on
the
patterns
to
hours
of
competition.
once
the
agreement
was
reached
between
the
majority,
yes
sir,
this
is
mr.
kelly
testifying,
the
union
man,
once
the
agreement
was
reached
between
the
majority,
yes
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
it
hurt
us
to
this
extent,
that
the
rest
of
the
industry
was
willing
to
go
along
with
this.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
we
weren't.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
because
we
were
faced
then
with
the
problem
of
a
strike.
if
we
are
correct
in
this
view,
that
strike
would
have
been
an
illegal
strike.
we
have
in
our
store
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
this
would
have
been
a
strike.
this
would
have
been
a
strike
to
compel
us
to
keep
our
shop
closed.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
now
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
but
--
oh
well,
mr.
justice,
you
are
now
--
you
are
now
adding
a
good
many
facts
to
your
equation.
this
isn't
the
question
i
answered
some
time
ago.
this
isn't
one
employer.
this
is
one
employer
who
was
trying
to
break
out
of
this
combine
and
is
being
held
in
it
by
the
others
saying,
“we'll
keep
our
stores
open
and
furnish
the
people
food
and
meat
and
drink.”
and
this
one
operator
will
be
in
effect
in
a
so-called
whipsaw
strike,
he
has
on
his
shelves
or
in
transit
at
any
time
roughly
$1
million
worth
of
produce.
the
damages
of
such
a
strike
are
astronomical
and
as
opposed
to
the
being
held
in,
and
suffering
the
illegal
strike,
we
said
we
can't
pay
the
price.
now
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
no,
not
under
the
circumstances
you
describe,
because
the
--
that
is
--
you
again
have
the
fact
of
the
pressure
of
the
uniformity,
the
anti-competitive
matter.
and
no
more
than
we
could
make
it
with
other
businessmen
could
we
under
those
circumstances
make
this
kind
of
a
deal
such
as
you
were
describing
under
the
facts
as
i
get
them
from
you
hypothetical.
we
wanted
an
opportunity
to
deal
with
it.
we
wanted
an
opportunity
but
we
never
could
get
it.
i
don't
see
--
well,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
minute
that
where
you
have
a
contract
that
fixes
wages
and
hours,
and
you
say
we
will
reinforce
it
by
a
restraint
of
trade,
the
question
is
answered.
now
this
court
has
always
held
that
in
the
line
of
cases
we've
pointed
out,
you
permit
a
deviation
in
the
oliver
case
for
example
where
they
were
subcontracting
out
to
get
around
contractor
and
it
didn't
concern
direct
terms.
you
say
that,
that
is
not
a
violation.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
we
would
concede
that.
yes
sir.
we
would
concede.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
unless,
unless
--
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
they
say
it
does,
but
i
think
that
one
is
answered
pretty
quickly
because
the
hours
of
work
are
exhaustibly
and
authoritatively
fixed
by
this
contract.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
was
not
much
impressed
with
the
disagreement.[laughter]
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well,
i
would
think
on
those
facts
justice
goldberg,
they
could
not.
now
if
you
showed
some
malice
on
our
part
or
an
attempt
to
drive
a
particular
man
out
of
business
and
i
think
we're
in
a
little
different
position
than
it
was
described
in
--
i
don't
think
it's
quite
analogous
to
what
i
understand
of
pennington
and
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
it.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
would
think
that
they
could
not.
now
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
here
that
the
union
officers
testified
that
if
the
one
store
stayed
open,
the
other
would
have
to
--
that's
to
aid
the
entrepreneurs
of
those
stores
and
that
is
a
subject
of
where
we
run
afoul
of
the
antitrust
laws.
the
public
is
entitled
to
a
difference
in
shopping
hours
if
it's
an
element
of
competition,
then
it's
certainly
is.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
now,
you
can
say
of
course
that
this
has
--
this
restraint
has
an
effect
upon
employment,
nearly
anything
that
goes
on
in
the
business
does.
you've
got
to
draw
the
line
somewhere.
now
there
would
be
no
stopping
and
the
minute
you
leave
off,
the
part
and
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
and
start
adding
commercial
restraints
on
top
of
it
when
you
already
fixed
the
terms
and
the
conditions
of
employment,
it
seems
to
me
you
obviously
are
trespassing
in
plain,
raw
commercial
restraints.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
well
i
would
think
probably
not
with
this
still
being
a
somewhat
religious
country
and
i
think
the
rule
or
reason
would
come
in,
but
you
have
a
finding
here.
mr.
george
b.
christensen
i
don't
want
to
get
involved
in
that.
what
you
have
here
mr.
justice
goldberg,
an
express
finding
that
this
is
an
unreasonable
restraint,
trade
and
certiorari
wasn't
granted
on
that
subject.
that
issue
is
closed.
well,
if
it
pleases
the
court,
i
have
a
few
minutes
time
left,
but
i
don't
think
there's
anything
i
can
add
to
the
discussion
that
has
gone
on
in
the
last
two
days.
what
we
have
to
say
is
better
said
in
our
brief.
i
do
want
to
say
that
we,
in
no
way,
agree
with
mr.
dunau's
representation
of
the
facts
and
we
most
emphatically
do
not
agree
with
his
theory
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
tip
the
district
court's
findings
upside
down.
it
did
so
repeatedly.
thank
you.
