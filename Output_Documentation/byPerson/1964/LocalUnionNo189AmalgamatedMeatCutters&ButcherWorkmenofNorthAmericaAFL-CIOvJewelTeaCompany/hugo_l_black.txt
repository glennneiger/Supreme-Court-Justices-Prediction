can
force
the
employer
to
do
with
reference
to
the
time
he
runs
his
shift.
how
far
does
it
go?
can
they
say
you
can
--
you
must
operate
only
between
10
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
five
in
the
afternoon?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
the
whole
business.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
you
do
not
here
but
that's
why
i
was
asking
you.
suppose
all
the
employees
wanted
to
change
course,
get
together
and
say,
now,
we
want
you
to
run
all
this
at
5
o'clock
until
three
in
the
afternoon
to
bargain
on
it.
could
you
do
that?
is
that
a
subject?
that's
what
i
thought
was
the
reach
of
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
solicitor
general.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
mean
that
any
time,
the
company
and
the
union
are
charged
with
violating
the
antitrust
law?
you'd
have
to
submit
to
the
jury
in
each
case
the
good
faith
of
what
they
were
doing?
in
reference
to
the
good
faith
of
--
whether
they
were
trying
to
agree
with
themselves
or
the
employees?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
isn't
a
rather
treacherous
criterion
to
try
to
divide
all
this
on
the
basis
of
what's
direct
and
indirect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
my
trouble
with
it
is,
would
it
be
the
announcement
of
a
rule
that
anybody
understands?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
it's
the
only
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
we
can
afford
maybe
a
few
minutes
to
the
other
side
and
i
want
to
ask
you
one
other
thing.
it
has
not
been
discussed
there
that
it
relates
to
the
part
of
the
court's
opinion
at
page
694
of
the
record
where
the
court
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
hour,
the
day
when
a
business
is
to
be
opened
to
accommodate
the
demands
of
customers,
the
judgment
of
the
owner
of
the
business,
it's
not
a
condition
of
employment
contrary
to
the
district
court's
finding,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
that's
a
question
of
finding,
but
as
long
as
all
rights
of
employees
are
recognized
and
duly
observed
by
the
employer
including
the
number
of
hours
or
days
that
anyone
shall
be
required
to
work,
any
agreement
by
a
labor
union
acting
in
concert
with
business
competitors,
designed
to
interfere
with
the
operation
of
a
retail
business
is
a
violation
of
the
act.
i'm
asking
that
for
this
reason.
we
finally
get
back
here
before
us
to
the
interpretation
of
the
act
as
to
how
far
it
was
intended
to
take
away
from
the
owner
of
the
business
his
right
to
running
it.
what
other
lines,
now
before
of
course
the
line
was,
before
the
act
that
either
the
--
that
the
employer
could
run
his
business
in
anyway
he
saw
fit
that
wasn't
prohibited
by
law.
now
it's
argued
and
perhaps
rightly
that
he's
not
--
he
doesn't
have
to
look
to
the
statute.
congress
has
delegated
that
business
to
the
agreements
between
the
labor
union
and
the
employer.
and
so
we
have
a
very
hard
line
of
distinction
to
see
how
much
is
left
to
the
employer.
what
do
you
say
about
the
distinctions
owned
by
the
court
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
anybody
else
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we're
going
to
have
a
law
as
to
when
your
business
will
operate.
the
point
i
was
asking
was,
they
seem
to
draw
a
distinction
here,
the
reference
to
an
employees'
right
to
insist
that
i'll
work
this
long
and
no
longer,
i'll
work
at
this
place
and
nowhere
else,
i'll
work
this
way
and
no
other
way.
they
draw
a
line
that
says
the
owner
has
a
right
to
say
how
his
business
shall
operate
if
he
can
get
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
line
drawn
here
is
--
it
maybe
a
wrong
one,
i
don't
say
it's
right,
i
don't
even
suggest
it
maybe
right,
but
the
line
they
attempt
to
draw
is,
that
the
employee
in
control
of
himself,
i'm
not
going
to
work
any
longer
if
there
is
anything
else,
but
that's
it.
employer
has
a
right
to
decide
how
he'll
run
his
business,
if
he
can
run
it
through
somebody
else.
they
can't
make
him
move
from
one
place
to
another.
they
can't
make
him
shut
it
up
at
a
certain
time
of
night.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
their
line
they
thought
it
best.
justice
hugo
l.

whose
shelf
is
that?
whose
shelve?
