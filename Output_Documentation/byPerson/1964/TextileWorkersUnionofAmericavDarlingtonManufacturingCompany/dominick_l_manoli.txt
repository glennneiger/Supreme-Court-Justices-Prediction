mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
fourth
circuit,
the
court
have
been
granted
the
petitions
of
both
the
labor
board
and
the
textile
workers
union
to
review
the
decision
below.
a
number
of
issues
have
been
posed
in
this
case,
but
as
we
view
this
case
in
its
present
posture,
we
think
that
the
only
issue,
which
this
court
need
breach
is
whether
an
employer
violates
the
prohibitions
of
the
labor
act
against
coercion
and
discrimination
when
he
liquidates
one
of
several
commonly
controlled
units
of
his
business,
because
the
employees
in
that
unit
have
selected
a
bargain
representative.
this
question
subsumes
the
answers
to
two
subsidiary
questions.
the
first,
whether
the
employer
here
liquidated
the
particular
unit
in
question
in
reprisal
against
the
employees
for
having
chosen
the
union
to
represent
them
and
in
order
to
escape
his
statutory
duty
to
bargain
collectively.
and
secondly,
whether
the
particular
unit
or
plant
mill
actually
here
in
question
was
part
of
a
larger
business
complex
under
such
common
control
and
ownership
as
to
constitute
the
whole
a
single
employer
for
purposes
of
the
act.
now,
the
board
answered
all
three
questions
in
the
affirmative
and
concluded
that
the
liquidation
of
the
darlington
mill,
that's
the
mill
we're
concerned
with
in
this
particular
case,
the
liquidation
of
the
darlington
mill
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
within
the
meaning
if
sections
8(a)(1)
and
8(a)(3)
of
the
labor
act.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
believe
you
don't
have
to
reach
that
question
your
honor.
now,
the
union
in
this
petition
did
present
that
question
and
the
court
of
course
granted
the
union's
petition
as
well
as
ours.
we
ourselves
did
not
present
that
issue
and
on
the
view
that
we
take
of
the
board's
subsidiary
findings
with
respect
to
the
single
employer
and
respect
to
the
motivation,
we
believe
that
you
don't
have
to
reach
the
issue
of
whether
a
single
employer,
an
employer
owning
a
single
plant
whether
he's
entitled
--
whether
he
can
go
out
of
business
even
though
it
may
be
for
anti-union
reasons
and
not
violate
the
statute.
of
course,
i'll
make
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
the
board
itself
has
concluded
that
even
in
the
case
of
a
single
of
an
employer
owing
a
single
plant,
going
out
of
business
altogether,
that
that's
a
violation.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
the
board's
opinion
in
this
case
goes
on
alternative
grounds,
your
honor.
because
in
the
opinion
you
will
note
that
after
the
board
has
discussed
whether
or
not
there
was
a
violation
on
the
basis
of
darlington
having
been
the
only
employer
in
this
case
and
on
page
18
of
the
record,
that's
volume
1
your
honor.
on
page
18
of
the
record,
the
paragraph
just
above
the
black
letter,
85
violation
in
which
the
board
there
indicates
that
it
is
going
on
alternative
grounds,
the
one
that
darlington
was
the
only
employer
and
that
in
any
event,
it
was
part
of
a
larger
complex
which
constituted
the
whole
complex,
one
employer
for
purposes
of
this
act.
now,
as
i
say,
the
board
answered
all
three
questions
which
i've
indicated
in
the
affirmative.
a
majority
of
the
court
below
accepted
the
board's
findings
of
the
fact.
it
assumed
arguendo,
the
board's
findings
with
respect
to
the
two
subsidiary
questions
that
i've
indicated
namely
motivation
and
the
single
employer
status,
but
it
rejected
the
board's
ultimate
conclusion,
there
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
here.
there
were
two
dissenting
members
who
would
have
upheld
the
board
on
all
three
counts.
in
the
limited
time
that
i
have,
i'm
afraid
that
i
can
sketch
the
facts
which
give
rise
to
the
controversy
only
in
the
most
skeletal
fashion.
in
march
of
1956,
the
textile
workers
union
began
to
organize
the
employees
of
the
darlington
mill
which
was
located
in
darlington,
south
carolina
and
despite
the
most
intensive
efforts
on
the
part
of
supervisory
personnel
to
coerce
the
employees
into
rejecting
the
union.
and
these
coercive
efforts
included
numerous
warnings
that
the
plant
would
close
down
if
the
union
won.
despite
these
efforts
in
majority
of
the
employees
voted
for
the
union
in
a
board
election
which
was
held
on
september
06
of
that
year.
roger
milliken,
who
is
the
president
of
the
darlington
mill
and
other
organizations
that
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment
in
this
case,
roger
milliken
was
immediately
informed
of
the
union's
victory
and
on
the
following
day
before
the
union
had
made
any
demands,
whatsoever,
on
the
following
day
he
decided
to
recommend
to
both
the
directors
and
the
stockholders
to
liquidate
the
darlington
mill.
the
upshot
box
that
on
october
17
of
that
year,
a
stockholders
meeting
was
called,
was
held,
to
consider
a
resolution
to
liquidate
the
mill.
roger
milliken
informed
the
stockholders
of
the
union's
victory
in
the
board
election.
he
also
stated
that
he
had
decided
to
liquidate
the
mill.
roger
milliken
at
this
meeting
held
65%
of
the
stock,
either
in
person
or
by
proxy
of
the
stock
of
the
darlington
mill.
6%
of
their
stock
was
owned
by
roger
milliken
and
the
members
of
his
own
immediate
family,
41%
was
owned
by
gary
milliken
and
the
18%
was
owned
by
cotwool
manufacturing
company
and
the
members
of
the
milliken
family
and
the
milliken
family
consists
of
approximately
27
individuals.
they
owned
the
majority
of
the
stock
in
both
gary
milliken
company
and
in
cotwool.
the
directors
–-
the
stockholders
rather
voted
with
a
few
dissenting
votes,
i
think
something
like
a
135,000
of
shares
voting
for
liquidation
and
3,000
of
shares
voting
in
against
liquidation.
the
stockholders
very
promptly
voted
to
liquidate
the
mill.
now,
milliken
testified
that
the
economic
outlook
of
the
darlington
mill
had
not
been
altogether
satisfactory.
but
i
think
the
record
shows
as
the
board
found
that
until
the
union
won
the
election,
the
milliken
interest
had
not
intended
to
close
down
the
darlington
mill.
in
fact,
during
the
nine
months
preceding
the
election
which
was
held
in
september
of
that
year,
during
the
nine
months
preceding
the
election,
the
milliken
--
the
company
has
spent
nearly
a
$0.5
million
dollars
modernizing
the
plant
and
roger
milliken
himself
testified
and
i
think
this
is
a
fair
summary
of
this
testimony.
roger
milliken
himself
testified
that
the
unionization
of
the
employees
triggered
off
the
decision
to
liquidate
the
mill.
and
indeed,
after
the
stockholders
meeting,
when
he
was
asked
why
he
was
closing
the
mill
in
view
of
the
fact
that
83%
of
the
employees
following
the
board
election
had
indicated
they
were
prepared
to
work
with
or
without
a
union.
his
answer
was,
that
as
long
as
there
was
this
hardcore
of
17%
labor
people
in
the
mill,
he
refused
to
run
the
mill.
the
mill
discontinued
operations
in
november
and
in
december,
the
machinery
and
equipment
was
sold
at
auction.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
sir.
and
there
is
some
suggestion
in
the
record
that
two
other
plants
which
had
become
unionized
had
been
also
liquidated,
but
i
don't
want
to
make
too
much
of
that
your
honor,
that's
merely
something
in
newspaper
article
and
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
the
unionization
that
caused
the
liquidation
or
other
factors,
but
there
is
something
to
that
effect
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
your
honor.
i
was
going
to
say
that,
as
a
result
of
the
liquidation
here,
500
employees
lost
their
jobs.
some
of
darlington's
unfilled
contracts
were
picked
up
by
other
mills
of
what
i
would
recall
that
deering
milliken
complex,
and
also
a
number
of
the
supervisors
that
were
working
at
darlington
were
transferred
to
other
parts
of
the
deering
milliken
organization.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
sir,
we're
not
claiming
as
a
runaway
plant,
no.
because
the
darlington
mill
was
discontinued
again
as
i
said,
some
of
these
contracts
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
except
the
fact
is
that
some
of
darlington's
unfilled
contracts
--
some
of
them
were
picked
up.
i
don't
know
how
much
was
involved.
some
of
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
sir,
there
isn't.
i
think
there
is
some
record
--
that
there
is
some
record
reference
said
one
of
the
mills
following
the
dissolution
of
the
darlington
mill
picked
up
some
of
darlington's
–
the
business
of
some
darlington's
former
customers
independently
of
any
contract
and
i
recall
saying
something
to
the
effect
of
something
like
10
million
pounds
of
some
kind
of
cloth
material.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
twelve
supervisors
were
placed
upon
a
list
for
transfer
to
other
parts
of
the
deering
milliken
organization
and
in
looking
over
this
rather
voluminous
record
and
i'm
not
quite
sure
that
i'm
entirely
--
i'm
not
entirely
sure
of
this,
but
at
least
three
of
them
were
transferred
to
other
corporations
in
the
organization.
now,
this
brings
me
to
the
interrelationship
between
deering
milliken
and
darlington.
deering
milliken
is
owned
by
a
south
carolina
corporation.
it
is
one
of
17
corporations
in
which
the
majority
stock
holdings
are
in
the
milliken
family
and
these
17
corporations
operated
some
27
mills
along
the
eastern
seaboard.
deering
milliken
company
acts
as
the
exclusive
agent
and
the
sales
factor
for
all
of
these
companies.
roger
milliken
is
the
president
of
all
but
one
of
these
corporations
and
the
members
the
milliken
family
constitute
a
majority
of
the
board
of
directors
of
all,
but
one
of
these
corporations.
the
milliken
family
either
directly
or
indirectly
owns
from
55
to
86%
of
the
stock
of
all
of
these
corporations.
i
don't
want
to
stop
here
for
details.
we've
summarized
them
in
our
brief
and
actually
i
couldn't
possibly
carry
them
in
my
mind,
but
in
some
the
record
shows
as
the
board
found
as
the
dissenting
members
of
the
court
below
agree
and
as
apparently
the
majority
of
the
court
below
will
prepare
to
accept
arguendo.
the
record
shows
that
there
is
interlocking
control
and
directorates
with
a
high
degree
of
integration
of
operations.
all
of
the
products
of
these
various
mills
are
sold
under
the
trade
name
milliken.
there
is
a
pooling
of
essential
services
for
all
of
these
organizations
and
this
includes
some
purchase
of
supplies
and
equipment,
operational
studies
and
recommendations,
the
handling
of
tax
and
insurance
matters,
and
the
recruitment
of
supervisory
and
technical
employees.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
the
next
item
i'm
going
to
say,
i
address
myself
to
you
your
honor.
roger
milliken,
i
think
the
record
pretty
fairly
indicates
that
he
is
the
directing
genius
of
this
entire
enterprise
and
while
some
of
the
mill
treasures,
who
are
in
immediate
charge
of
these
various
mills,
have
a
considerable
degree
of
autonomy
and
running
the
operations
of
the
mill
from
day
to
day.
from
day
to
day,
the
fact
is
that
it
is
roger
milliken
who
holds
a
range
of
this
entire
empire
in
his
hands
and
that
it
is
he
who
exercises
a
very
pervasive
and
comprehensive
control
over
the
entire
operations
of
the
business
including
his
personal
as
well
as
his
labor
policies.
in
fact,
the
decision
to
liquidate
mill
was
essentially
his.
as
judge
bell
said
in
the
court
below,
that
the
record
here
shows
that
the
deering
milliken
complex
was
a
thoroughly
integrated
monolithic
enterprise
with
the
milliken
family
and
particularly
roger
milliken
is
the
executive
agent
in
charge
of
the
entire
enterprise.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
is
assumed
that
--
i
think
it's
unfair
to
say
that
it
assumed
that
arguendo.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yeah,
that's
right.
it
assumed
actually
the
motivation,
the
anti-union
motivation,
and
it
also
assumed
arguendo
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
boards
finds
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
right.
the
court
took
the
position
as
you
could
--
as
an
employer
he
could
liquidate
any
part,
any
phase
of
his
business,
the
whole
of
it
or
part
of
it,
whatever
his
reason
might
have
been.
and
coming
back
to
briefly
what
the
board
found
in
this
case,
the
board
found
first
that
the
liquidations
of
the
mill
was
prompted
not
by
economic
considerations
as
argued
by
the
respondents,
but
by
the
purpose
to
escape
the
duty
to
bargain
collectively.
secondly,
the
darlington
and
deering
milliken
constituted
by
virtue
of
the
interrelationship
constituted
a
single
employer
for
the
purposes
of
this
act
and
that
both
were
responsible
for
the
violation
for
the
unfair
labor
practice.
the
board's
order
requires
deering
milliken
and
darlington
to
reimburse
the
employees
for
any
loss
of
wages
as
a
result
of
the
unfair
labor
practice.
the
order
also
requires
deering
milliken
to
offer
these
people
reinstatement
at
its
nearby
mills
and
if
--
not
to
offer
reinstatement,
but
to
offer
them
employment
at
its
nearby
mills
and
in
the
event
their
employment
is
not
available
to
place
them
on
a
preferential
hiring
list.
the
back-pay
liability
terminates
either
upon
the
employees
obtaining
a
substantial
equivalent
employment
somewhere
else
or
with
the
deering
milliken
mills
or
upon
they
being
placed
upon
a
preferential
hiring
list
at
the
other
deering
milliken
mills.
the
order
it
should
be
noted
does
not
require
darlington
to
reopen
the
mill.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
has
to
pay
them
as
long
as
they
have
not
received
substantially
equivalent
employment
or
if
such
employment
is
unavailable,
as
long
as
they're
not
placed
upon
a
preferential
hiring
list.
in
other
words,
deering
milliken
here
could
have
cut
off
their
back
pay
liability
either
by
offering
these
people
substantially
equivalent
employment
of
its
other
mills
or
if
that
work
was
not
available,
by
putting
them
on
a
preferential
hiring
list,
that
would
have
cut
off
the
back
pay
liability.
now
as
i've
indicated
the
court
below
accepted
the
board's
findings
of
the
fact.
it
accepted
arguendo,
the
two
findings
with
respect
of
status,
a
single
employer
status
and
the
anti-union
motivation.
but
it
concluded
that
even
if
darlington
was
a
division
or
department
of
the
deering
milliken
complex,
nevertheless,
there
was
no
violation
because
an
employer
in
its
view
is
free
for
any
reason
including
anti-union
reasons
to
discontinue
any
part
of
its
business
either
part
or
the
whole.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
sir,
because
the
--
all
of
the
machinery
and
the
equipment
was
sold
at
auction,
piecemeal
in
december
of
that
year.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
not
challenged,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
found
the
liquidation
was
for
anti-union
reasons.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
no.
but
there
is
no
--
the
purchasers
of
the
equipment
of
the
mill,
it
was
a
good
faith's
purchase,
no
question
about
the
bona
fide
of
the
purchase.
now,
originally,
when
we
filed
our
petition
here,
we
had
asked
this
court
--
i
didn't
put
it
this
way.
we
think
that
the
board's
subsidiary
findings
have
a
solid
support
in
the
record
and
we
think,
judge
bell
below
that
those
findings
should
be
sustained.
however,
the
majority
only
accepted
these
findings
arguendo.
and
in
our
petition,
we
ask
to
this
court
to
accept
those
findings
also
arguendo
and
to
deal
with
a
legal
issue
on
that
basis.
however,
i
may
add
that
all
of
the
parties
that
have
addressed
themselves,
so
those
two
issues,
the
motivation
and
the
single
employer
and
while
we
were
reluctant
to
burden
this
court
with
the
determination
and
ultimate
resolution
of
those
subsidiary
issues
that
the
court
feels
and
find
to
address
themselves
to
do
--
to
them.
did
i
say
the
parties
have
brief
the
issues
and
i
don't
know
if
there's
much
more
that
any
of
us
can
say
upon
those
particular
issues.
i
will
not
discuss
further
the
single
employer
issue
here,
because
i
want
to
go
on
to
other
matters
in
the
brief
time
that
i
have,
and
i'm
afraid
this
is
running
very
fast.
the
--
i
started
with
a
premise
that
the
board's
findings
of
anti-union
motivation
and
the
single
employer's
status
are
correct.
and
in
that
posture,
then
i
believe
that
the
issue
that
we
have
here
is
whether
an
employer
whose
business
embraces
a
number
of
plants
violates
the
statute
when
he
liquidates
one
of
them.
when
he
liquidates
one
of
them
because
he
is
afraid
of
the
unionization
of
his
employees.
now,
one
of
the
basic
guarantees
of
the
national
labor
policy
is
the
right
of
employees
to
engage
in
concerted
activity
and
to
select
representatives
for
purpose
of
collective
bargaining.
it's
long
been
settled,
it's
long
been
recognized
that
this
guarantee
is
impaired
if
not
vitiated,
if
an
employer
threatens
to
close
his
plant,
if
his
employees
become
unionized.
if
he
temporarily
closes
his
plant
in
order
to
get
rid
of
these
union
employees
or
if
he
transfers
a
plant
from
one
location
to
another
in
order
to
avoid
collective
bargaining
or
finally
if
he
transfers
work
to
an
independent
contractor
because
the
employees
performing
the
work
for
him
have
become
unionized.
now
all
of
these
illustrations
involve
the
exercise
of
so-called
“management
prerogative.”
but
the
underlying
principle
is,
that
an
employer
may
not
use
his
--
either
his
economic
power
or
his
so-called
management
prerogatives
in
order
to
coerce
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
rights
under
statute
or
to
discriminate
against
it.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right
your
honor,
the
reason
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
correct.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
understand
that.
but
the
reason
that
i
refer
to
those
cases,
your
honor,
is
because
there
is
much
talk
here
about
fundamental
management
prerogatives
and
as
i
say,
i
think
those
cases
stands
for
the
proposition
if
that's
not
necessarily
the
end
of
the
argument.
in
fact
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
the
prerogative
of
going
out
of
business,
it
seems
to
me
is
pretty
much
on
the
same
fine
as
the
prerogative
of
whether
to
transfer
it
back
from
one
place
to
another.
in
either
case
--
in
either
case,
the
exercise
of
that
prerogative
has
resulted
in
the
loss
of
jobs
by
employees
because
they've
elected
to
exercise,
there
are
rights
under
the
statute.
now,
nearly
30
years
ago,
there's
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
sir,
no
sir.
let
me
make
clear
one
point,
the
issue
whether
--
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case
about
the
darlington
having
had
to
bargain
with
the
union
about
the
liquidation.
that
issue
was
not
presented
to
the
board,
it's
not
in
this
case.
we
don't
have
the
fiber
board
type
situation
here.
the
board
did
find
an
8
(a)(5)
case
here,
but
found
8
(a)(5)
on
the
basis
that
the
liquidation
was
prompted
by
--
purpose
to
avoid
bargaining
with
the
union
which
the
employees
had
selected
as
a
bargain
representative,
with
respect
to
the
usual
terms
and
conditions
of
the
plants.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
correct,
that's
right.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir,
i
couldn't
get
to
that.
just
a
minute.
speaking
of
management
prerogatives,
i
should
like
to
say
one
more
word,
that
last
term
in
the
wiley
case,
this
court
declared
that
even
the
rightful
prerogatives
of
the
owners
of
a
business
to
rearrange
it
or
even
to
eliminate
themselves
as
employers
must
be
balanced
against
the
need
to
protect
the
interest
of
the
employees
under
the
national
labor
policy.
now,
in
this
case
here,
the
deering
milliken
people
by
the
exercise
of
their
management
prerogative
by
exercise
of
a
clean
fundamental
rights
have
wiped
out
500
jobs,
because
the
employees
ventured
to
exercise
their
rights
under
the
statute.
i
don't
think
anyone
is
going
to
dispute
the
utterly
destructive
impact
of
this
action
upon
the
employees'
enjoyment
of
their
rights.
by
this
wholesale
discharge,
deering
milliken
and
darlington
served
notice,
not
only
upon
the
darlington
employees,
but
served
notice
upon
all
of
the
employees
in
its
19
chains
of
corporation.
and
these
employees
totaled
close
to
19,000
in
that
vicinity.
by
this
action,
they
served
notice
upon
them
with
the
price
of
the
present
or
continued
employment
in
the
deering
milliken
complex
was
a
surrender
of
the
rights
which
guarantees
to
employees.
and
i
submit
your
honor,
that
it
is
not
within
the
par
of
any
employer
to
impose
that
price
as
the
condition
of
employment.
now,
we
are
told
that
an
employer
cannot
be
compelled
to
remain
in
business
and
that
if
he's
willing
to
pay
the
price
of
foregoing
profits
and
the
foregoing
other
business
advances,
then
he's
free
to
discontinue
any
phase
of
his
businesses
regardless
of
whether
his
purpose
is
to
avoid
the
unionization
of
his
employees.
in
the
first
place
your
honors,
there's
nothing
in
the
history
of
the
act
or
its
philosophy
that
remotely
suggests
that
discrimination
or
coercion
becomes
something
less
or
that
they're
excused
because
the
employer
is
willing
to
pay
the
price
for.
if
the
theory
that
it
hurts
the
employer
more
than
it
hurts
the
employees
were
a
valid
theory,
i
suggest
that
even
a
discriminatory
lockup
would
be
valid
under
this
theory.
under
the
theory
that
it
hurts
the
employer
more
than
it
may
hurt
the
employees,
because
it's
temporarily
closed
to
close
down.
but
apart
from
this
fact,
the
critical
factor
in
this
case
is,
that
deering
milliken,
the
employer
in
this
case,
deering
milliken
has
not
removed
itself
from
the
economic
arena.
it
is
merely
liquidated
one
unit
of
its
wide
scale
business
and
has
continued
to
engage
in
the
same
kind
of
business
of
which
darlington
was
an
essential
part.
any
one
of
the
26
mills
of
the
deering
milliken
complex
is
potentially
free
to
pick
up
the
business
of
darlington.
and
as
i
indicated
a
moment
earlier,
in
fact
after
darlington
was
liquidated
some
of
these
mills
picked
up,
some
of
darlington's
unfilled
contracts,
and
also
picked
up
some
business,
at
the
moment
i
don't
know
just
how
much,
also
picked
up
some
business
from
some
of
the
darlington's
former
customers.
now,
if
that
is
a
respondent's
argue,
the
abandonment
of
an
effort
to
get
the
profits
to
obtain
other
business
advantages
is
the
test
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
violation.
i
suggest
your
honors
that
test
is
not
met
here.
analytically,
this
case
is
not
really
much
different
than
the
case
of
an
employer
who
discharges,
let
us
say
10%
of
his
employees,
because
they'd
become
unionized
and
it
continues
to
operate,
perhaps
at
a
reduced
capacity.
in
both
cases,
the
employees
who
have
elected
to
exercise
their
statutory
rights
have
been
punished,
in
both
cases,
the
employer
is
continuing
to
do
business
and
in
both
cases
he
has
served
notice
upon
the
employees
that
their
livelihood
depends
upon
the
refraining
--
they're
refraining
from
exercising
their
statutory
rights
and
in
effect
giving
him
immunity
from
the
statutory
obligations.
now,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
the
board
is
of
the
view
that
even
the
total
discontinuance
of
a
business
for
anti-union
reasons
is
a
violation.
but
i
suggest
your
honors
that
even
if
we
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument,
the
total
discontinuance
of
business,
in
case,
whether
an
employer
removes
himself
altogether
from
the
economic
arena
because
he
is
unwilling
to
live
within
the
framework
of
the
national
labor
policy,
even
if
we
assume
that
the
answer
there
that
it's
not
unlawful
for
him
to
do
so,
i
suggest
your
honors
that's
not
necessarily
decisive
of
this
case.
because
if
as
respondents
continually
remind
us,
if
economic
suicide
is
the
test
of
whether
or
not
there
is
violation
in
this
type
of
case,
i
suggest
your
honors,
the
employer
in
this
case
is
very,
very
far
from
being
debt.
now,
this
does
not
mean
of
course
that
an
employer
may
not
discontinue
a
part
of
his
business
or
any
part
of
his
business
just
because
it
happens
to
be
unionized.
he
may
discontinue
his
business
for
any
of
the
--
any
legitimate
economic
reasons
or
indeed
out
of
sheer
caprice.
the
critical
factor
is
more
than.
now,
the
respondents
argue
in
this
case
here,
that
they
were
prompted
by
economic
factors
and
the
argument
is,
that
the
unionization
of
the
employees
and
the
possible
economic
burdens
that
the
employer
could
anticipate
from
the
unionization
of
the
employees
is
the
kind
of
legitimate
economic
factor
that
an
employer
can
take
into
account
and
act
upon
it.
now
in
the
first
place,
this
argument
i
think
flies
in
the
teeth
of
the
board's
findings,
which
where
that
the
employer
here
liquidated
the
darlington
plant,
not
because
of
economic
factors
but
by
a
purpose
to
escape,
the
duty
to
--
and
the
statutory
obligation
to
bargain
collectively.
but
apart
from
that,
the
argument
would
really
subvert
the
statute,
because
quite
often
an
employer's
hostility
to
unionization
of
his
employees
comes
down
to
a
matter
of
dollars
and
cents.
now,
if
an
employer
could
say
that
the
unionization
of
his
employees
and
the
anticipated
economic
burdens
that
unionization
might
bring,
that
that
were
the
kind
of
legitimate
economic
factors
on
which
he
could
act,
then
i
suggest
your
honors
that
there's
nothing
to
prevent
the
employer
from
discharging
his
employees
as
soon
as
they
join
a
union.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
it
might
have
a
different
situation
in
that
kind
of
a
case,
because
there
the
employer
has
bargained
with
the
union.
he
has
explored
his
economic
package
and
it
might
well
be
said
that
having
explored
that
economic
type
you
should
--
knowing
what
it's
going
to
cost
to
live
with
the
union
and
at
that
point,
it
maybe
that
is
--
the
decision
to
go
on
is
prompted
by
what
might
be
regarded
as
legitimate
economic
considerations.
but
i'm
saying
your
honor
that
we
don't
certainly
reach
that
issue
in
this
case
here,
because
there
was
never
any
attempt,
never
any
attempt
to
bargain
with
this
union.
of
course,
the
union
had
campaigned
that
assures
to
what
it
was
going
to
demand
from
the
employer,
but
i
hardly
did
remind
this
court,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
election
propaganda
and
what
actually
happens
at
the
bargaining
table.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
your
honor
i
think
that
there
was
a
very
strong
suggestion
in
this
record
that
--
one
of
the
reasons
why
this
mill
was
liquidated
is
that
--
these
employers
unwilling
to
do
business
with
any
union.
in
addition
to
that,
because
they
say
--
i
don't
see
how
an
employer
at
this
stage
--
at
this
stage
of
the
game
where
union
has
won
election,
they
haven't
even
gotten
it
to
the
bargaining
table,
where
the
employer
can
say,
well,
i
think
that
i
--
that
the
employer
can
say
at
that
point,
“well,
the
economic
burdens
of
the
unionization
of
my
employees
that
it
will
not
permit
me
to
stay
in
business
and
i'm
going
to
go
up.”
if
you
permit
him
to
do
that,
it
seems
to
me,
then
you're
really
have
sacrificed
the
employees'
interests.
now
it
maybe
that,
when
you
come
to
the
bargaining
table
and
the
union's
package
and
it's
fairly
clear
what
it's
demanding
that
maybe
at
that
point
the
employer
can
go
out
of
business
without
being
charged
with
an
unfair
labor
practice.
but
short
of
that
point,
i
don't
believe
that
the
employer
can
be
permitted
to
say
that
the
unionization
was
the
kind
of
an
economic
factor.
the
mere
anticipation
of
demands
was
the
kind
of
an
economic
factor
which
makes
legitimate
his
action.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
--
yes,
it
would.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
83%
of
the
employers
were
reported
to
have
--
some
signed
--
some
signed
some
sort
of
a
petition
and
apparently
they
indicated,
they
were
prepared
to
go
to
work
with
or
without
the
union.
then
it
seemed
to
have
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
oh,
yes.
yes.
and
milliken's
response
to
that
as
i
indicated
earlier
was
that
as
long
as
there
was
this
hardcore
of
17%
labored
people
in
the
place,
he
would
refuse
to
run
the
mill.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
think
so
very
much
so
your
honor,
very
much
so.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
think
when
you
take
that
in
your
consideration
with
all
the
other
factors,
it
pretty
much
indicates
the
most
natural
reading
of
this
your
honor.
the
most
natural
reading
of
this
is
that
the
milliken
interests
were
not
prepared
to
deal
with
any
union
at
any
of
their
plants
and
i
think
that
that
is
natural
reading
of
this
statement.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
what
kind
of
survey
your
honor?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
or
there
was
–
the
state
had
the
studies
of
the
plant
made
as
i
indicated
earlier
--
as
i
indicated
earlier,
the
milliken
testified
that
the
company
had
been
experiencing
some
economic
difficulties.
but
the
point
that
i
suggest
--
what
i
suggested
earlier
was
that
until
the
union
came
and
won
the
election,
nothing
in
the
record
suggest
that
the
milliken
people
were
to
contemplating
closing
down
that
mill.
in
fact,
during
the
nine
months
preceding
the
election,
they
had
spent
nearly
a
half
a
million
dollars
modernizing
the
plant,
which
hardly
sounds
like
there
were
going
out
of
business.
what
really
made
the
difference
is
the
union.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
but
this
modernization
had
been
going
on
during
that
first
nine
months
prior
to
the
--
prior
to
the
election.
yes,
they
--
they
had
their
problems,
i
wouldn't
deny
that
darlington
had
their
problems.
there
were
market
problems,
competition
for
an
imports
and
what
have
you,
but
there
was
no
suggestion,
i
think
the
record
is
clear
that
until
the
union
came
into
picture
they
were
not
contemplating
closing
the
plant
down.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
there
is
no
such
specific
finding
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
that's
a
fair
inference
because
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
sure
that
this
information
would
not
have
been
a
secret
from
the
other
people
working
in
the
milliken
mills.
and
number
2,
following
the
election,
milliken
sent
a
magazine
article
to
various
mill
treasures.
and
he
purposed
his
memorandum
transmitting
this
magazine
article,
but
the
fellow
who
had
written
his
article
knew
what
he
was
talking
about.
and
one
of
the
things
that
the
magazine
article
indicated
was
that
the
final
lesson
to
be
learned
from
the
darlington
affair
is
the
need
for
good
public
relations

to
sell
milliken's
point
of
view
with
respect
to
the
unionization.
in
other
words,
in
milliken,
roger
milliken
writing
these
various
mill
treasures
he
said,
“while
this
article
shows
that
the
union
leaders
definitely
mislead
the
people,
it
also
points
out

mill
was
negligence
in
its
public
relations.
i
hope
you'll
read
the
second
part
of
the
article
carefully
and
review
in
your
mind
the
steps
that
are
your
taking
to
bring
about
an
understanding
of
your
mill
and
its
promise
to
your
community.
the
unions
are
going
to
be
making
a
tremendous
drive
all
through
this
area
and
there
are
few
things
that
are
more
important
to
us
in
making
sure
that
the
leaders
in
the
community
understand
and
are
sympathetic
to
what
we
are
trying
to
do.”
