mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
in
my
brief
time,
i
hope
to
address
myself
to
essentially
two
aspects
of
this
case.
one
is
the
remedy
which
is
of
extreme
importance
to
the
union
and
the
other
thing
is
that
i
hope
that
i
would
be
successful
in
putting
to
bed
any
suggestion
by
the
employer
that
they
close
this
mill
for
economic
purposes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
before
i
get
into
any
of
the
issues
here,
i
want
to
suggest
that
mr.
manoli
was
rather
modest
in
his
suggestion
that
the
record
contains
some
suggestions
as
he
says
that
the
other
plants
were
closed
because
of
the
union
activities
of
employees
noted
during
the
mills.
when
the
court
gets
a
chance,
i
recommend
that
they
read
pages
115
to
117,
volume
iii
and
there
is
demonstrable
evidence
that
there
were
a
number
of
closings
of
the
mills
during
strikes,
the
evidence
of
which
came
from
the
mouth
of
roger
milliken
himself.
as
a
matter
of
fact
after
reading
this
record,
the
conclusion
is
inevitable.
now
what
you
got
here
is
a
milliken
formula
for
destroying
unions.
just
closing
darlington
is
just
one
of
a
number
such
mills.
this
--
this
medium,
this
weapon,
and
the
arsenal
of
all
the
economic
weapons
is
rather
new
as
far
as
mr.
milliken
is
concerned
and
i
say
no
for
the
past
10
years
he
has
exercised
it.
but
i'm
going
to
get
through
some
of
the
evidence
of
that.
before
i
do,
let
me
suggest
however,
that
what
the
union
objects
to
insofar
as
the
board's
remedy
is
concerned
is
that
we
feel
that
the
board's
remedy
is
inadequate.
the
board's
remedy
we
feel
falls
far
short
of
dissipating
the
course
of
impact
of
the
darlington
shut
down.
we
suggest
the
modification
of
the
board's
order,
so
that
the
board
will
direct
the
reestablishment
of
the
darlington
mill
or
in
the
alternative,
put
the
city
of
darlington
on
a
preferential
list
so
that
in
the
future
when
deering
milliken
deals
a
plant
as
they
do
very
frequently,
as
i
will
demonstrate,
they
will
select
the
city
of
darlington
whom
they
almost
demolished
by
the
shutdown
as
a
preferential
matter.
now,
let
me
spend
a
couple
of
moments
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
i
suggest
that
when
deering
milliken
builds
another
plant,
then
i
might
say
that
this
is
not
an
infrequent
indulgence
on
the
part
of
deering
milliken.
we
have
evidence,
for
example,
if
you
examine
page
1333
of
general
counsel's
exhibit
13,
you'll
find
the
heading
by
deering
milliken,
“10
new
mills
during
the
past
10
years.”
now,
moreover,
in
1963
they
spent
$45
million
in
purchasing
and
acquiring
7
or
8
mills
from
textron.
the
point
i
make
is
that
in
this
frequent
purchasing
and
building
of
mills,
it's
not
an
unreasonable
suggestion
that
the
next
mill
that
deering
milliken
mills,
they
should
build
in
the
city
of
darlington
which
so
far
they
turned
into
a
legacy
or
the
mohawk
valley
and
that
is
not
an
unreasonable
request.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
i
think
that
the
--
i
would
suggest
that
the
practices
of
milliken
are
really
unprecedented
and
i
don't
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
well,
the
board
has
decided
in
a
number
of
cases
particularly
preston
feeds
as
decided
by
this
very
circuit,
the
fourth
circuit
in
ordering
the
reestablishment
of
a
trucking
division,
for
example
that,
that
company
did
away
with
it
and
sold
and
transferred
to
another
corporation.
the
only
difference
i
suggest
between
the
two
is
that
preston
--
that
is
preston
feed
involved
three
workers.
deering
milliken
involved
500,
i
don't
assume
that
there's
a
difference
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
between
treating
a
small
corporation
and
directing
the
reestablishment
of
division
as
against
dealing
with
a
giant
corporation.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
city
of
morrison,
6,000
sir.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
now,
if
you
please
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
yes,
if
it
please
your
honor.
if
you
don't
involve
three
cases
that
i
know
of,
the
order
in
steamship
company
case,
the
district
50
united
mineworkers
and
the
southern
steamship
company
case
that's
true
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
well,
in
the
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
no,
in
some
cases
of
curtailment.
for
example
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
an
enlargement.
yes,
sir.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
i
believe
that
in
the
waterman
case,
for
example,
where
the
board
--
waterman
steamship
company
case,
where
the
board
decided
that
the
discharges
were
to
be
sustained,
this
court,
i
believe
directed
the
board
to
reinstate
those
of
the
seaman,
which
were
discharged
under
the
order
of
the
court.
i
might
say
that
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
in
this
case?
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
it's
my
suggestion
as
i
indicated
that
the
board
ordered
the
deering
milliken
company
to
give
preference
to
the
city
of
darlington
in
the
next
mill
that
it
selects
for
erection
or
acquisition.
i
might
suggest
that
when
you're
going
to
examine
the
criteria
laid
down
by
this
very
court
in
determining
where
the
remedy
is,
we
will
find
that
the
remedy
is
wholly
inadequate.
i
think
i've
got
a
right
to
ask,
what
sort
of
remedy
is
it,
that
permits
an
employer
to
retain
the
fruits
of
his
unlawful
conduct.
this
record
is
devastating
in
the
proof.
and
i
don't
have
the
time
to
get
to
it,
that
deering
milliken
went
out
purposely
to
destroy
this
union.
and
if
we
established
that
and
we
permit
deering
milliken
to
retain
the
fruits
of
that
kind
of
activity,
i
suggest
that
this
is
not
an
effective
remedy
or
the
kind
of
remedies
suggested
by
10(c).
let
me,
if
i
may
direct
your
attention
to
what
i
think
is
the
most
devastating
piece
of
material
that
if
we
can
refer
to
as
evidence
in
determining
what
was
it
that
deering
milliken
sought
to
achieve
by
the
closing
of
the
mill.
and
in
answering
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
for
example,
i
suggest
that
the
object
was
not
only
to
destroy
the
union
in
darlington,
but
it
was
also
to
discourage
the
membership
in
any
of
the
other
mills
in
deering
milliken.
and
i
ask
the
court,
if
it
please,
to
examine
volume
5,
which
mr.
manoli
directed
your
attention
to
before
and
i
just
like
to
read
to
two
excerpts,
which
i
believe
demonstrates
more
than
anything
else.
what
was
in
the
heart
and
mind
of
robert
milliken?
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
this
is
volume
5.
volume
5
begins
on
page
177
with
a
memorandum
directed
by
robert
milliken
to
each
of
the
executives
of
each
the
deering
milliken
mill.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
this
is
volume
5
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
it's
all
right.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
on
page
177,
is
this
memorandum
from
robert
milliken
to
all
of
the
executives
of
each
of
the
mills.
in
which
he
encloses
an
article
from
this
american
textile
reporters
and
asked
them
to
read
it
carefully
and
to
bring
--
which
will
bring
about
an
understanding
of
your
mill
and
its
problems
in
your
community.
and
it's
suggested
you
read
more
carefully
the
latter
portion
of
the
article
which
he
encloses.
let
me
read
just
two
parts
of
it.
on
page
180,
if
you
please,
the
second
paragraph
everywhere
the
same
story
was
repeated,
“if
the
only
the
union
had
left
our
people
alone,
we
could
have
gotten
along
fine.
the
man
who
pumped
the
gas
at
the
gas
station
had
a
wife,
and
a
mother
who
were
working
in
the
mill.
"they
did
not
work
for
the
union
but
he
said,
“they
got
to
suffer
along
with
the
rest
to
listen
to
the
promises
of
the
union
fellows.”
and
finally,
i
think
this
court
would
be
interested
on
page
182,
the
concluding
paragraph
in
the
middle
there
of
when
the
article
says
the
following.
“when
dallas
manufacturing
company
of
huntsville,
alabama
became
unionized,
the
millikens
liquidated
it
contrary
to
the
opinion
of
the
many
local
people
that
such
would
not
be
the
case.
we
ourselves
are
small
shareholders
in
darlington
and
from
experience
and
acquaintanceship;
we
knew
the
minute
the
union
election
vote
was
announced
that
we
would
receive
a
call
for
a
special
meeting
to
vote
for
liquidation.”
now,
this
is
a
memorandum
sent
by
roger
milliken
to
the
heads
of
each
of
these
affiliated
mills
to
bring
it
to
their
attention,
but
for
what
purpose?
it
was
not
enough
for
him
to
destroy
the
collective
bargaining
rights
of
the
union
of
darlington.
he
wanted
to
make
sure
that
the
workers
in
other
affiliated
mills
got
the
message.
everyone
who
attained
the
idea
of
joining
the
union,
you'll
be
sure
to
remember
the
object
lesson
of
darlington
and
that's
what
this
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
no,
sir.
all
we
had
is
this
message
being
delivered
to
the
executives
of
mills
with
the
instructions
that
they
give
it
to
the
community.
now,
let
me
bring
this
point
out,
if
you
please.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
well,
the
board
of
course
did
make
a
finding
and
the
trial
examiner
made
a
finding.
that
the
883
violation
was
so
complete
and
overwhelming
as
to
destroy
the
collective
bargaining
rights
of
this
union.
it
didn't
make
the
finding
as
i
recall
it
with
respect
to
the
other
plant,
it
directed
its
attention
to
darlington.
now,
let
me
direct
my
attention
to
the
single
employer
issue,
which
i
think
maybe
critical.
my
adversaries
here
come
into
this
court
and
suggest
that
there
is
no
common
ownership
and
there
is
no
common
control.
the
two
ingredients
of
a
single
control,
i
might
remind
the
senator
from
north
carolina
who
did
have
not
the
privilege
of
presenting
to
the
board,
as
i
did
not
have
the
case
before
the
trial
board.
that
before
the
trial
board,
deering
milliken
and
darlington
came
in
and
said
that
darlington
and
deering
milliken
has
common
control,
they
conceded
it
in
that
situation.
when
they
came
before
the
court
of
appeals
they
have
altered
their
position
as
follows.
they
denied
common
ownership
and
admitted
that
roger
milliken,
the
force
of
this
whole
outfit
could
have
controlled
as
against
having
actually
exercised
the
control.
now,
we
have
analyzed
the
testimony
here
with
respect
to
single
control.
and
i
would
like
to
intrigue
this
court.
and
instead
of
yielding
to
the
request
of
the
employer
and
yes,
even
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
send
this
issue
back
to
the
court
of
appeal.
i
suggest
that
after
eight
years
of
litigation
and
it
is
not
an
unreasonable
request
to
ask
this
court
to
make
a
definitive
resolution
of
these
issues.
the
single
employer
control
issue
is
i
believe
established
by
overwhelming
evidence.
i
don't
have
the
time
to
address
myself
to
all
of
it,
but
let
me
just
give
you
--
direct
your
attention
to
one
exhibit,
which
in
my
judgment
is
devastating
to
the
employer's
suggestion
that
there
isn't
any
single
control.
and
i
direct
the
court's
attention
to
general
counsel's
exhibit
b(13)
page
1337.
and
here
in
great
big
words--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
this
is,
if
you
please,
volume
4
of
the
joint
appendix,
page
1337.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
i
know
what
it
means
to
this
overburdened
court
to
do
that,
but
i
believe
it
is
in
the
interest
of
justice
and
that's
all
i
could
say
that
this
court
will
not
shrink
from
its
burdens
if
it
finds
the
evidence
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
the
court
has
done
before,
if
you
please.
and
all
of
the
parties
have
briefed
question,
which
might
lighten
the
burden
of
the
court
a
bit.
on
page
1337,
just
look
at
this
literature
that
darlington
milliken
puts
out.
the
magic
of
mill
integration
--
just
as
a
big
league
ball
club
is
a
team
of
specialists,
each
playing
an
important
position
and
working
with
the
others
to
control
the
play,
so
is
the
textile
team
with
milliken,
a
group
of
specialist
mills.
each
expert
in
some
type
of
phase
textile
production
and
closely
integrated
to
control
from
start
to
finish,
the
properties,
cost
and
qualities
of
the
fabrics
they
produce.
so
out
of
the
mills
of
robert
milliken
again
comes
a
submission.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
roger,
there
are
many
brothers
there
that
i
might
confuse.
however,
the
single
employer
issue,
which
i
indicated
is
so
thoroughly
briefed
that
i
don't
want
to
spend
much
more
time
on
it.
i
do
want
to
address
myself
now
to
the
question
of
remedy,
which
i
know
the
courts
is
extremely
interested
in.
it
should
be
remembered
in
answer
to
the
questions
asked
by
this
court
that
deering
milliken
was
only
one
of
four
mills
who
produced
print
cloth.
so
that
when
it
shutdown
a
mill
of
one
of
four,
it
was
analogous
to
my
humble
judgment,
to
merely
shutting
down
a
department.
now,
if
the
milliken
formula
becomes
law,
all
it
means
is
that
any
large
corporation
having
a
department
incorporated,
if
that
gives
it
any
special
status
in
the
eyes
of
the
law,
closes
down,
it
then
gives
to
that
corporation
immunity.
and
i
hope
i'm
not
presumptuous
in
asking
this
court
the
rhetorical
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
board's
decision
in
this
case
doesn't
setup
demurrer,
that
if
a
company
is
big
enough,
if
it's
rich
enough,
if
it
is
wealthy
enough
to
close
down
on
mill
and
meet
the
liability
of
back
pay,
it
then
can
close
itself
with
immunity
from
liability
under
the
law.
and
i
ask
also
what
kind
of
remedy
is
it
that
permits
deering
milliken
who
set
out
to
destroy
the
union
and
to
set
out
to
destroy
the
collective
bargaining
rights
to
retain
the
fruits
of
that
objective,
which
he
does
under
this
particular
decision?
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
if
he
closed
down
the
entire
milliken
–
well,
the
nature
of
the
violation
would
be
of
course
of
greater
monstrosity
having
nobody
else
to
--
no
other
plant
to
look
for,
we
would
suggest
that
under
the
laws
of
various
states
that
he
be
held
responsible
for
the
liabilities
of
the
acts
that
he
committed
during
his
life
time
as
a
corporation.
and
we
would
suggest
that
the
he
be
made
--
he
may
call
of
the
employees
that
suffered
from
that
violation
of
the
law.
i
don't
believe
it
makes
much
difference
whether
he
closes
out
one
plant
or
closes
down
the
entire
plant.
it's
a
matter
of
degree
on
how
great
an
offense
he
wants
to
commit.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
well,
i
have
a
right
to
assume
if
you
please,
that
if
the
national
labor
relations
act
has
as
one
of
its
purposes,
as
its
central
thrust,
the
encouragement
of
collective
bargaining
by
section
7.
and
the
encouragement
of
organizing
that
any
act
which
attempts
to
frustrate
that
objective
set
out
especially
for
that
is
an
act
in
violation
of
the
law.
now
this
is
not
an
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
no,
the
court
below
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
a
little
inconsistent,
because
it
not
only
decided
that
for
the
contrary
in
another
case
would
order
the
reestablishment
of
a
department
given
away
sold
in
preston
feed
case.
now,
if
this
milliken
formula,
the
destruction
of
jobs
is
permitted
to
go
on
with
judicial
approbation.
i
suggest
we
will
have
given
giant
corporations
the
one
leverage
to
destroy
unions.
there
isn't
anything
that
strikes
the
fear
into
the
heart
of
a
worker
anymore
then
does
the
threat
to
close
down
a
mill.
and
i
might
pose
these
suggestions
if
you
please
mr.
justice,
that
it's
pretty
well
settled
in
the
law,
that
if
you
threaten
to
close
down
a
mill,
so
as
to
deprive
the
members
of
the
right
to
bargain,
it's
a
violation,
case's
origin
on
that
but
according
to
the
company,
if
you
execute
that
threat,
then
you
may
do
so
with
impunity.
according
to
the
employer,
if
you
shutdown
temporarily,
it's
a
violation
of
the
law,
but
if
you
convert
that
temporary
shutdown
to
a
permanent
shutdown,
that's
fine,
that's
okay.
if
you
fire
half
of
the
people
of
a
corporation,
it's
a
violation
of
the
law,
but
convert
that
half
to
a
totality
of
firing,
then
it
is
fine
and
it
is
okay.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
white,
it
depends
on
where
you
draw
the
line.
if
the
corporation
is
smart
enough
let
me
say
to
sit
down
and
bargain
with
the
union
and
has
in
its
mind
that
after
bargaining,
it
just
cannot
get
the
kind
of
the
concessions
from
the
union
are
permitted
to
stay
open,
it
may
close.
but
in
this
case,
they
didn't
even
go
through
the
motions
of
bargaining.
it
set
out
to
destroy
the
union
once
the
vote
was
announced.
now,
if
the
union
is
going
to
be
certified
as
a
bargaining
agent,
that's
a
pretty
empty
certification
if
the
law
is
going
to
give
approbation
to
the
destruction
of
that
certification
by
firing
discriminatorily
every
one
of
these
people.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
the
board
found
as
a
matter
of
findings,
as
well
as
the
trial
examiner,
that
there
were
30
instances
before
and
after
the
directors
decided
to
close
the
mill
of
black
listings,
of
threats
to
close
the
plant,
if
they
ordered
to
the
union
and
what
you
have
got
in
my
humble
judgment
is
not
only
a
case
too
generous,
but
the
most
egregious
kind
of
violations
that
we
have
ever
come
across.
if
a
company
is
free
to
indulge
in
this
kind
of
destructive
anti-union
bias
by
shutting
down
a
whole
town,
i
certainly
have
a
right
to
hope
it's
not
going
to
be
with
judicial
approbation.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
has
nothing
whatever
in
the
history
--
list
of
history
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
indicates
any
congressional
purposed
to
the
private
enforce
of
their
right
to
withdraw
from
business
at
anytime
for
any
reason.
on
the
contrary,
there
was
have
--
the
legislative
history
shows
the
contrary.
this
act
had
its
genesis
in
the
wagner
act.
when
the
wagner
act
was
before
congress,
congressman
griswold
of
indiana,
a
ranked
member
of
the
committee
which
reported
the
bill
for
the
house
assured
the
house
that
they
have
the
house's
assurance,
there
is
nothing
in
the
bill
to
keep
an
operator
from
closing
his
plant
and
when
the
white
act
was
before
the
senate,
senator
walsh,
chairman
of
the
senate
committee
which
reported
the
bill,
gave
this
assurance
to
the
senate.
now,
some
fundamental
rights
an
employer
has
just
as
our
rights
an
employer
--
an
employee
has.
no
one
can
impel
--
compel
an
employer
to
keep
his
factory
open.
so
in
dealing
with
this
bill,
we
have
not
gone
into
that
domain.
the
wagner
act
was
subsequently
converted
to
the
national
labor
relation
acts
by
subsequent
amendments.
the
act
in
its
present
form,
uses
the
term
employee
78
times,
the
term
employer
64
times,
the
term
employment,
22
times
and
the
term
commerce
which
it
defines
to
mean
interstate
commerce,
31
times.
in
all
essences,
the
terms
employee,
employer,
employment
and
commerce
are
used
in
the
act
in
context
which
disclose
that
congressional
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
secure
to
employees
the
right
to
organize
and
bargain,
collect
to
represent
just
their
own
to
choosing
it
with
their
employer
in
respect
to
rates
of
pay,
wages,
hours
of
employment
and
other
conditions
of
employment,
and
to
forbid
the
employer
for
the
engaging
in
unfair
practices
interfering
with
such
rights,
so
long
and
so
long
only,
as
the
employment
relation
exists
between
the
employees
and
their
employer,
and
so
long
and
so
long
only,
as
their
employer
is
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
or
in
an
industry
affecting
interstate
commerce.
there
is
not
a
syllable,
a
word,
a
phrase,
a
paragraph
or
a
section
in
the
act,
which
can
be
reasonably
construed
to
deny
to
any
employer
in
the
private
business,
the
power
to
remove
himself
from
the
regulatory
power
of
congress
under
the
interstate
commerce
clause
at
any
time
for
any
reason
by
vehemently
going
out
of
business.
if
congress
had
undertaken
to
pass
an
act
of
that
character,
it
would
not
only
have
exceeded
its
power
under
the
interstate
commerce
which
is
restricted
to
the
power
to
regulate
people
while
they
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
or
in
an
industry
affecting
interstate
commerce,
but
it
would
have
been
reported
to
the
economic
rights
secured
to
americans
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
it
would
have
denied
darlington
as
a
corporation,
the
right
of
property
that
it
--
one
of
the
fundamental
rights
of
property
to
which
is
a
right
secured
for
that
--
of
a
clause,
to
go
out
to
this
sale
of
its
property
at
any
time
it
pleases
--
and
also
it
would
have
denied
the
right
protected
by
the
due
process
clause
deliberative
property
on
behalf
of
the
stockholders
of
darlington,
because
it
would
have
denied
them
the
privilege
of
exercising
the
liberty
of
disarming
the
corporation
and
taking
it
as
their
own
property,
for
either
sales
or
their
net
assets
of
the
corporation.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
well,
the
railroad
is
a
public
utility
which
is
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
well,
the
difference
in
commerce
is
that
the
railroad
is
a
public
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
is
a
public
utility,
it
gets
exclusive
privilege
as
in
the
[inaudible]
nape
of
monopoly.
and
it
operates
under
a
public
franchise,
that's
not
true
of
about
private
employers
and
that's
the
fundamental
distrait
distinction.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
yes,
it's
based
upon
the
commerce
clause
plus
the
fact,
that
the
railroad
in
tennessee
can
merely
a
private
profit
for
sale,
is
engaged
in
the
performance
of
a
duly
affected
with
the
public
interest
and
for
that
reason,
since
it
gets
to
public
franchise
in
the
nature
of
monopoly
cannot
withdraw
as
a
private
of
business
can.
i
think
that's
the
fundamental
mistake.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
--
just
a
few
more
words
that
there
never
has
been
a
case
in
which
there
has
been
a
more
diligent
effort
on
the
part
of
the
general
counsel
to
make
out
of
case.
he
took
almost
six
years
of
time
in
order
to
propel
this
case
and
dig-up
evidence.
he
produced
thousands
of
pages
of
all
testimony,
and
inspected
thousands
of
documents
belonging
to
some
20
different
corporations.
and
when
all
of
this
evidence
was
produced,
the
trial
examiner
who
did
a
most
thorough
job,
made
this
correct
finding.
he
said
in
effect
that
there
was
not
a
scintilla,
i
mean
not
a
bit
of
evidence
introduced
in
this
case
which
was
inconsistent
with
the
complete
independence
of
darlington
and
that
all
the
thing
the
evidence
showed
with
respect
to
the
relations
of
darlington
to
other
corporations
was
and
it
had
the
same
normal
relations
to
deering
milliken,
the
sales
agent,
as
ordinarily
existed
between
a
manufacturer
and
corporation
and
the
sales
agent,
and
that
it
merely
had
some
limited
cooperation
of
a
voluntary
nature
with
some
of
the
other
corporations
in
an
effort
to
minimize
the
cost
of
tax
service,
the
cost
of
tenants
service
as
the
industrial
engineers,
and
lack
of
services
essential
to
its
existence
of
which
it
could
not
otherwise
have
obtained
or
obtained
so
cheaply.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
i
think
that
you've
come
down
to
the
question.
the
finding
is
that
they
closed
down
to
keep
them
dealing
with
the
union
that
is
the
first
thing.
now,
the
only
one
that
was
obligated
to
deal
with
the
union
was
the
darlington
plant
which
had
been
designated
as
an
appropriate
bargaining
unit
and
it
was
only
one
obligated
to
deal
with
the
union,
the
other
plants
that
had
no
union
representation.
now
that
the
courts
upheld,
that
is
the
lower
courts
have
handed
down
decisions
which
are
cited
in
brief,
that
if
an
employer
who
has
several
plants,
closes
down
the
plants
which
is
a
self-sustained
and
economic
unit
in
itself
that
he
is
not
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
(voice
overlap)
in
doing.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
yes.
that's
we've
cited
cases
in
the
brief
as
i
interpret
them
now
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
well,
one
of
them
is
a
rapid
tran
--
rapid
boundary
incorporated
and
in
that
case
they
had
two
plants,
one
in
--
one
place
in
new
york
and
another
one
they
closed
down
the
first
and
continued
to
operate
the
second,
and
held
that
it
would
not
guilty
--
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
the
first
plant.
then
--
this
court
has
only
made
one
pronouncement
on
this
subject,
and
it
says
in
this
case
of
the
southport
petroleum
company
case,
which
was
passed
in
the
315
united
states
of
page
100.
in
that
case,
there
had
been
labor
controversy.
and
after
the
order
of
the
national
labor
relations
would
refine
reinstatement,
and
the
case
got
into
the
circuit
court,
the
employer
attempted
to
raise,
in
court
he
said,
he
go
and
complete
the
out
of
business.
he
sold
--
he
has
claimed
and
going
out
of
business
after
the
order
was
entered
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.
the
circuit
court
declined
to
order
--
uphold
the
evidence
taken
on
that
part
and
this
court
held
that
that
was
alright
of
course
the
port
could
be
erased
down
the
compliance
decision
after
the
decision
of
this
court
and
in
that
opinion,
mr.
chief
justice
jackson
said
--
stated
--
recognizes
and
uses.
he
says,
“well,
there
has
been
a
modified
discontinuance,
at
a
true
change
of
ownership
which
would
terminate
the
duty
of
reinstatement
created
for
the
board's
order
or
merely
a
disguise
continuous
to
all
employer
does
not
clearly
unfair,”
and
he
said,
“that
matter
can
be
passed
on
the
compliance
thing.”
now,
i
would
like
to
make
--
these
are
--
these
closing
observations.
this
is
a
practical
matter.
practically
every
substantial
business
in
united
states
has
to
guide
its
conduct
by
the
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
they
have
to
do
this
under
the
interpretation
placed
upon
it
by
lawyers
and
by
businessmen,
practical
men.
and
i
think
there's
something
in
the
king
james
version
of
the
bible
that
has
a
direct
reference
to
this
matter,
a
practical
--
uses
some
practical
wisdom.
it
said,
“god
judges
not
as
man
judges.
obey
him,
looketh
upon
the
external
appearance,
but
god
looketh
upon
the
heart.”
now,
we
have
this
kind
of
a
situation
under
the
case
of
this
nature.
every
economic
factor
indicates
that
the
only
successful
thing
for
the
business
to
do
is
to
go
out
of
existence.
that's
what
all
the
economic
facts
is,
it's
all
the
external
appearances
are.
as
to
thing
that
businessmen
and
the
lawyers,
they've
had
to
guide
themselves
them
out.
can
it
be
said
that
instead
of
having
an
objective
standard,
we
have
to
have
a
subjective
standard
and
in
any
cases
where
every
economic
factor
demands
it
as
a
matter
of
sound
judgment,
the
termination
of
the
business,
that
the
case
terminates
the
business
because
of
–
because
of
perhaps
while
the
[inaudible]
to
have
a
sound
head
and
good
exercise
of
the
good
intellectual
judgment,
they
have
a
sort
of
bad
part,
is
that
the
kind
of
things
as
a
practical
matter
in
this
case.
now,
it
was
said
yesterday
that
deering
milliken
got
into
this
matter
by
offering
these
people
employment,
but
he
couldn't
done
it
because
it
was
six
years
after
the
darlington
went
out
of
business
before
it
was
ever
said
that
it
was
entered
a
duty
on
anybody
to
reinstate
these
employees.
and
then
the
order
was
made
that
darlington
would
have
to
pay
these
employees
until
16
other
corporations,
which
are
not
parties
to
this
case,
either
employ
the
darlington's
former
employees
or
put
them
out
of
the
preferential
list,
all
until
the
last
[inaudible]
upon
trembles
and
to
ultimate
silence.
and
why
is
darlington
to
suffer
that
penalty?
because
it
didn't
furnish
employment
to
these
people
after
its
resolution
and
its
liquidation
back
in
1956.
now,
it
couldn't
furnished
the
employment
because
this
plant
was
so
peace
mean
that
it
was
dismantled
and
its
machine
was
sold
and
99%
of
this
machine
that
was
sold
to
a
corporation
[inaudible]
and
had
no
connection
with
the
milliken,
in
any
way
and
it's
not
all
it
couldn't
have
done
so
as
a
physical
matter,
but
it
couldn't
have
done
so
as
the
matter
of
law,
it
had
no
legal
capacity.
darlington
was
a
south
carolina
corporation
organized
for
the
purpose
of
operation
of
a
manufacturing
plant
to
manufacture
textbooks
and
the
act
of
the
south
carolina
section
12-601
of
the
1940
--
52
code
which
was
in
existence
provides
that
when
a
corporation
is
dissolved
in
any
matter,
its
life
is
continued
merely
for
the
purpose
of
liquidating
its
affairs
and
litigating
causes
of
action
arising
prior
to
its
dissolution.
and
it
says
this,
but
it's
life
--
but
it
can
do
those
things.
but
it
does
not
continue
to
exist
for
the
purpose
of
continuing
the
business
for
which
they
were
established.
so,
it
didn't
have
the
physical
capacity,
it
didn't
have
the
legal
capacity
to
do
what
is
to
be
penalized
for
not
doing.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
well
i'll
handle
that
this
way.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
roger
milliken
had
only
one
connection
with
this
whole
controversy
prior
to
the
election.
it
was
handled
entirely
by
the
general
manager
of
the
darlington
whose
name
was
jim
olan.
and
the
only
connection
of
roger
milliken
had
with
it,
was
that
--
he
instructed
darlington's
counsel,
he
was
the
president
of
darlington.
he
instructed
darlington's
counsel
to
advise
olan
during
the
campaign
as
to
the
law
applicable
to
the
situation.
that's
his
only
connection
until
after
the
election
has
been
carried.
now
all
that
roger
milliken
did
after
that
was
to
show
that
he
was
a
diligent
and
a
sincere
person
of
darlington.
he
recognized
that
if
there
was
a
substantial
number
of
the
employees
that
will
oppose
to
the
necessary
--
the
increased
use
of
labor,
a
more
advanced
and
efficient
use
of
labor
in
order
to
keep
the
mill
in
existence,
that
the
mill
could
not
possibly
avail
of
the
marginal
nature
of
darlington,
could
not
possibly
do
it.
now,
those
statements
that
were
made
were
in
an
editorial,
not
what
the
milliken
said,
but
in
an
editorial
which
pointed
out
that
in
the
controversy
concerning
darlington,
that
the
union
had
assured
these
people
that
if
they
elected
the
union
it
could
never
--
the
darlington
could
never
go
out
of
business
and
its
management
could
not
put
into
effect
a
program
which
was
necessary
for
the
economic
survival
of
darlington.
and
all
he
said
in
that
connection
was
that
he
called
us
to
the
attention
of
the
managers
of
the
other
mills
which
operated
during
milliken
as
a
selling
agent,
that
they
all
--
that
they
had
full
public
relations
in
darlington.
and
the
inference
is
that
if
he
fails
that
--
it
had
good
public
relations,
that
the
people
of
darlington
would
have
understood
that
the
union
was
trying
to
take
over
the
management
of
the
plant
they
have,
and
he
--
and
that
they've
[inaudible]
–
the
liquidation
would
not
have
been
necessary.
the
economic
situation
will
not
come
about
and
all
he
suggested
was,
there
should
be
good
public
relations
for
the
communities
in
which
they
operated.
that
was
instructions
to
the
managers
of
plant
and
not
to
the
union.
i
won't
say
that
on
this
evidence
that
the
decision
of
national
labor
relations
board
has
confirmed
to
evidence,
is
confirmed
to
the
provisions
of
the
act
and
the
interpretation
based
upon
the
act
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
inconsistent
with
the
power
of
congress
under
the
commerce
clause
and
repugnant
to
the
due
process
clause
of
fifth
amendment.
i
thank
the
court's
for
the
patience
in
hearing
accorded
to
this
small
town
lawyer.
