justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
board's
opinion
in
this
case
can
be
read
to
embrace
that,
i
think.
justice
john
m.
harlan
were
any
of
the
other
plants
lose
expression
unionized?
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
to
review
the
findings
of
the
board
that
this
was
a
single
enterprise.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
assumed
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yeah.
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
had
made
no
difference
if
you
could
liquidate
a
party
or
business.
justice
john
m.
harlan
darlington
was
another
view
--
resuscitated
once
the
union
was
put
out
of
the
picture?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
the
question
of
the
good
faith
of
this
liquidation
is
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
challenged.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing,
the
situation
had
been
that
instead
of
liquidating
at
the
point
it
did,
darlington
had
gone
ahead
6
months
with
the
union
collectively
bargained
and
then
decided
that
the
union
demands
are
as
such
that
it
could
not
wish
to
continue
operating
and
then
it
liquidated,
would
your
case
be
different?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
the
same
line
of
reasoning
would
result
in
a
single
employer
not
being
able
to
go
out
of
business.
justice
john
m.
harlan
one
of
the
purposes
of
what
darlington
did
was
to
influence
--
bank
unionization
of
the
other
plants?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
but
i'm
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
they
decided
to
put
up
another
plant,
the
board
should
require,
they
must
rebuild
or
reopen
that

justice
john

â€“
was
the
product
made
by
darlington,
different
product
made
in
the
other
plants?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
the
other
plants
have
taken
over
the
darlington
right
out
