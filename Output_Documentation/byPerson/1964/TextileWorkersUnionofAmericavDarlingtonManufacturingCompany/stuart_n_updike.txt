mr.
stuart
n.
updike
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
brief
time
that
it
remains
for
me,
i
would
like
to
do
three
things.
one,
i
would
like
to
give
the
court
my
views
as
to
the
problems
which
are
placed
before
it
on
this
record
by
these
appeals.
second,
i
would
like
to
raise
a
question
of
law
that
there
is
on
the
common
ownership
requirement
in
connection
with
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
a
single
employer
is
closed
by
the
record.
and
lastly,
i
would
like
to
answer
if
i
may,
some
of
the
questions
according
to
my
views
of
these
facts,
some
of
the
questions
that
were
posed
both
yesterday
and
today
by
the
court.
and
specifically
and
while
it
is
fresh
in
my
mind,
i
would
like
to
answer
the
question
to
mr.
chief
justice
brennan
in
that,
i
know
of
no
case,
where
there
was
directly
involved
a
motivation
to
close
down
the
plant
(a)
in
order
to
avoid
or
prevent
or
restraint
the
organization
at
another
plant
and.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
it
does
not,
no
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
both
the
board
itself
and
the
court
below
stated
and
i
think
it
is
the
fact
that
there
is
no
case
precisely
like
this
one,
but
i
would
urge
upon
the
court
in
view
of
the
questions
that
were
asked
yesterday
to
bear
with
me
while
i
bring
to
the
court's
attention
that
we
have
made
a
careful
search
of
this
record
and
i
think
i'm
the
only
lawyer,
not
the
only
one
in
the
courtroom,
but
the
only
one
who
has
addressed
the
court,
who
had
anything
to
do
with
this
case
in
the
course
of
its
trial.
and
i
assure
the
court
that
our
search
of
this
record
has
shown
no
finding
requested
and
no
finding
made
either
by
the
trial
examiner
or
by
the
board
itself
with
respect
to
any
purpose
or
motivation
with
respect
to
the
closing
of
darlington,
as
regards
any
other
plant
of
the
respondent
deering
milliken
viewing
it
for
the
moment
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
--
as
a
single
employer,
which
of
course
i
do
not
concede.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
yes
sir.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
practically,
all
of
these
exhibits
were
put
in
by
the
board.
what
the
board
did
in
conjunction
with
ourselves
was
to
review
the
corporate
history
of
darlington
and
of
deering
milliken
and
statement
of
a
so-called
service
corporation
and
the
so-called
research
corporation
reviewed
the
entire
file
history
of
those
companies
for
a
period
of
two
years
antecedent
to
the
darlington
closing.
and
practically,
all
of
these
exhibits
were
selected
out
by
the
board
and
were
placed
in
evidence.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
yes
sir.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
yes,
it
followed
after
the
closing
and
milliken's
only
reference
to
it
was
that
he
thought
that
this
would
be
interesting
to
them
in
considering
their
relations
with
their
communities
and
of
sympathetic
understanding
of
the
problems
that
they
had.
and
so
long,
according
to
my
understanding
of
the
law,
so
long
as
the
employer
restricts
communications
such
as
this
to
supervise
every
personnel
and
in
this
instance,
as
i
believe
this
record
clearly
shows,
in
fact,
there
was
finding
by
the
trial
examiner
unreversed
by
the
board,
in
this
industry,
the
treasurers
of
these
companies
are
in
the
unique
position
under
their
bylaws
of
being
the
chief
executive
officers
answerable
only
to
the
boards
of
directors,
that's
precisely
what
the
bylaws
of
darlington
showed.
and
so
when
the
board
refers
in
these
briefs
to
milliken
being
the
president
of
this
and
the
president
of
that,
this
record
shows
that
the
relationship
of
the
president
in
the
textile
business
is
that
roughly
corresponding
to
the
chairman
of
the
board.
he
is
a
senior
executive
who
presides
at
meetings
of
shareholders,
with
the
actual
running
of
the
business
and
the
decisional
responsibilities
with
respect
to
the
business
on
this
record,
held
by
the
client
examiner
and
unreversed
by
the
board,
is
in
the
hands
of
the
treasurer
and
it's
his
responsibility
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
on
the
contrary,
they
used
it
to
show
a
general
anti-union
bias
on
the
part
of
milliken.
milliken
was
on
the
stand
in
this
case
for
about
five
days
under
examination,
both
on
the
first
hearings
where
it
went
to
the
violation
at
darlington
itself,
and
on
the
subsequent
hearings
which
went
to
the
single
employee
status
problem.
and
in
the
course
of
that,
that
was
introduced
and
used
exclusively
to
show
bias
in
respect
of
milliken's
motivation
with
regard
to
the
closing
of
darlington,
who
had
darlington
as
an
independent
unit.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
that
is
correct
sir.
there
was
no
finding
either
by
the
trial
examiner
or
by
the
board.
now
if
the
court
please,
it
is
my
view
that
the
primary
problem
before
this
court
is
what
it
deals,
how
it
deals
with
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
now
the
board
here
decided
first,
there
was
a
violation
at
darlington
when
darlington
went
out
of
business.
that
was
an
affirmation
of
the
holding
of
the
trial
examination
--
the
trial
examiner.
the
board
reversely
examined,
however,
with
regard
to
the
so-called
single
employer
issue
and
held
that
there
was
a
single
employer
presented
here.
the
court
of
appeals,
and
incidentally
those
--
the
decision
by
the
board
was
treated
too
with
the
two
dissents
as
to
the
issue
of
single
employer,
and
one
dissent
as
to
the
issue
of
violation.
at
the
court
below,
we
have
the
court
below
holding
that
darlington
viewed
as
an
independent
unit
had
an
absolute
right
to
go
out
of
business,
and
that's
holding
number
1.
and
then
without
deciding
anything
with
respect
to
the
fact
on
the
single
employer
issue,
the
court
below
accepting
the
findings
of
the
board
arguendo
only,
went
on
to
hold
that
even
in
those
circumstances
so
long
as
the
going
out
of
business
was
complete,
unsigned,
permanent,
it
was
on
the
same
parity
or
on
a
parity
with
the
same
problem
as
presented
by
darlington
viewing
it
as
a
separate
unit
on
its
own.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court
has
faced
before
the
issue
with
respect
to
darlington.
what
does
it
do?
does
darlington
have
the
right
to
go
out
of
business
for
any
reason
on
this
record,
without
violating
this
act?
and
it
seems
to
me
that
although
the
board
has
urged
this
court
that
it
may
disregard
that
issue
that
it
may
not
disregard
it
and
it
should
face
up
to
that
as
the
primary
issue
here.
now,
mr.
manoli
and
mr.
abramson
have
both
asked
this
court
to
proceed
to
the
decision
of
the
single
employer
issue
before
it,
because
i
think
it
was
mr.
manoli
who
said
it
was
fully
briefed
or
i
state
to
the
court
with
respect
that
it
has
not
been
fully
briefed.
in
the
first
place,
in
spite
of
manoli's
assurance,
when
the
--
when
solicitor
general
cox
put
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
here,
he
stated
to
this
court
and
to
his
adversaries
as
well,
in
the
footnote
on
page
10,
“since
the
court,
meaning
the
court
of
appeals,
did
not
consider
whether
the
finding
was
sustained
on
substantial
evidence,
the
issue
would
appear
to
be
open
on
remand.”
the
second
reason
why
we
have
not
done
it
is
because
we
have
understood
the
rule
of
this
court
to
be
starting
with
the
universal
camera,
and
ending
with
the
united
states
or
nlrb
against
walton
in
1960,
this
court
reviews
the
primary
job
that
revealing
evidentiary
determinations
by
the
board
to
be
the
job
of
the
courts
of
appeal
and
not
of
this
court.
and
so,
in
preparing
all
the
briefs
on
behalf
of
deering
milliken
for
this
court,
our
only
treatment
of
the
issue
of
single
employer
is
the
treatment
of
an
issue
of
law,
and
that
issue
of
law
is
precisely
this.
the
board
stated
in
classic
terms
and
terms
with
which
we
do
not
disagree,
that
the
tests
for
single
employer
are
common
ownership,
common
control
of
operations,
common
control
of
the
crucial
area
of
labor
relations
in
such
a
way
that
a
common
enterprise,
whatever
that
phrase
means
it's
produced.
in
oral
argument
to
this
court,
we
have
taken
the
first
element,
the
element
of
common
ownership
because
there
the
record
is
not
complicated.
it's
based
on
a
stipulation
that
appears
in
the
record
with
regard
to
the
share
ownership
by
the
milliken
family,
the
members
of
the
milliken
family
and
where
they
own
the
shares.
and
we
make
a
contention
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
if
common
ownership
is
an
ingredient
in
the
totality
of
a
single
employer
status,
then
no
case
has
ever
held
that
any
common
ownership
posture
such
as
we
find
on
these
facts
has
ever
been
held
to
result
in
a
single
employer
states.
we
have
not
argued
the
very
--
we
have
not
argued
the
very
complicated
facts
on
this
record
with
respect
to
the
risk
of
the
single
employer
problem.
the
court
below
--
in
the
court
below,
the
board's
brief
alone
was
96
pages
devoted
to
an
analysis
and
presentation
of
the
evidence
on
this
single
employer
question.
it's
a
long
record.
it's
replete
with
many,
many
exhibits.
some
of
the
exhibits
running
50,
80
pages
in
length
and
we
submit
that
on
this
record,
it
would
be
going
against
this
court's
own
precedents,
not
to
send
this
back
if
the
court
disagrees
with
the
court
below
on
the
issues
presented
as
i
have
outlined
them
a
moment
ago.
now,
i
would
like
if
i
may,
to
turn
to
certain
questions
that
were
asked
by
the
court
yesterday.
they
were
(inaudible)
proof
of
them,
dealing
with
whether
there
was
any
evidence
of
any
kind
that
business
had
been
shifted
from
darlington
to
any
other
plan
connected
with
deering
milliken
company
or
selling
products
through
deering
milliken
company.
and
mr.
manoli
stated
that
he
thought
that
there
was
some
of
what
this
record
shows
that
in
each
instance,
the
only
contracts
that
ever
went
to
deering
milliken
and
company
for
--
or
to
a
company
connected
with
it,
were
first
offered
in
the
open
market
competitively,
see
if
any
other
company
would
do
it,
and
in
the
very
few
instances
in
which
it
did
occur,
sometimes
darlington
paid
a
premium
in
order
to
get
someone
else
to
produce
the
particular
goods
in
order
to
satisfy
the
claims
of
customers.
in
other
instances,
darlington
itself
paid
the
premium
to
the
customer
in
order
that
the
customer
would
in
effect
cancel
out
on
the
contract
obligation
at
that
time.
that
is
the
record
with
regard
to
it
and
the
trial
examiner
spent
some
12
pages
of
findings
in
this
record
with
respect
to
that.
and
its
conclusion
was,
that
there
was
no
substantial
evidence
that
any
part
of
dalington's
business
found
its
way
into
the
mills
of
deering
milliken
and
company.
now
in
other
words,
when
the
court
below
said
that
this
is
not
a
runaway
plant
and
they're
--
that
we
are
confronted
here
with
a
situation
that
a
complete
and
permanent,
i
believe
the
court
was
correct
and
on
the
records
before
this
court,
what
this
court
should
do
is
affirm
the
court
below
on
the
ground
that
when
an
employer
ceases
to
be
an
employer
and
takes
himself
out
of
the
coverage
of
the
act
like
taking
himself
out
of
the
commerce
covered
by
the
act,
that
that
should
be
an
end
to
it
and
that
the
penalty
involved
in
going
out
of
business
should
be
regarded
as
to
sanction.
that
same
sanction
should
apply
even
when
there
are
several
plants
involved
so
long
as
those
plants
are
separate,
self-sustaining
economic
units
with
a
profit
objective,
because
by
going
into
bankruptcy
or
going
out
of
business,
the
penalty
on
the
employer
is
so
great
that
it
is
not
surprising
that
this
is
the
first
case
in
20
years
under
the
wagner
act
to
produce
this
problem,
i
believe.
in
other
way,
it's
from
the
time
the
wagner
act
came
into
existence
until
1956,
this
was
the
first
instance
in
which
an
employer
had
taken
this
step
with
respect
to
a
problem
arising
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
posed
issue
of
illegality
under
that
act.
so,
i
would
ask
if
the
court
agrees
that
it
affirm
the
court
below,
but
if
it
does
not
and
cannot
affirm
the
court
below,
and
if
it
finds
we
are
wrong
in
this
contention,
then
i
submit
that
the
complicated
problems
of
the
single
employer
status
should
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
as
suggested
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
bringing
the
case
on
certiorari
here,
on
behalf
of
the
board
and
as
urged
in
our
own
brief.
thank
you
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
yes
sir?
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
yes
sir.
basically,
it
is
--
may
i
have
30
seconds,
i
think
i
can
explain.
there
is
a
spectrum,
the
term
print
ports,
there
were
some
five
so-called
print
ports
[inaudible]
but
there
is
a
spectrum
of
products
all
the
way
from
sheer
thin
stuff
like
muslin
on
the
one
hand,
all
the
way
down
to
materials
such
as
dungarees
that
children
wear.
the
size
of
the
threads
are
different,
the
size
sometimes
of
the
--
it's
in
the
cross
threads,
there
were
thousands
of
constructions
that
are
involved.
and
they
shift
over
from
one
to
another,
may
take
much.
so
that
--
in
that
neck
darlington,
as
the
record
shows,
was
in
what
was
called
the
fancies
business,
the
other
mills
were
not
in
the
fancies
business.
fancies
means
that
they
have
a
circus
effect
like
the
ripple
that
the
senator
spoke
about
yesterday
in
a
[inaudible]
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
some
of
them
undoubtedly
had
machinery
sufficiently
versatile,
that
after
a
period
of
time
they
could
have.
but
the
evidence
is
clear
that
all
of
these
mills
were
running
six
days
a
week,
24
hours
a
day,
so
that
something
has
to
go
off
the
looms
if
you
would
like
to
take
darlington's
business
or
any
other
business
and
put
it
on
the
other
looms.
and
in
this
situation,
it
would
have
taken
a
long
one
to
affect
any
kind
of
a
shift-over
even
though
--
perhaps
the
line
was
profitable,
but
these
are
not
interchangeable
constructions
on
this
record.
in
other
words,
they're
not
the
same.
you
can't
just
go
from
one
to
another
and
accept
them
as
being
the
same
--
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
what
is
that
sir?
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
there
was
few
instances
that
i
mentioned
in
speaking
to
mr.
justice
brennan
in
answer
to
his
question,
yes
sir.
mr.
stuart
n.
updike
thank
you
sir.
