mr.
irving
abramson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
not
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
pre-enterprise
in
textile
industry
rides
on
this
case.
when
i
was
asked
to
make
the
whole
argument
before
the
court
on
half
of
darlington,
i
first
satisfied
myself
that
there
was
no
legal
impediment
to
my
doing
so.
i
then
gave
serious
consideration
of
the
quaver,
my
fairness
for
darlington
would
conflict
with
my
obligation
as
the
senate.
and
i
reached
a
deliberate
conclusion
that
instead
of
being
in
a
conflict
between
them,
my
fairness
for
darlington
harmonized
with
my
obligation
as
a
senator.
my
obligation
as
a
senator
requires
me
to
support
the
constitution
and
to
serve
the
best
interest
of
my
country
and
my
state.
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
as
i
interpret
it,
guarantees
that
every
person
in
america,
the
economic
freedom
to
go
out
of
any
private
business
at
anytime
for
any
reason
satisfactory
to
him.
and
presenting
darlington's
cause,
i
seek
to
preserve
this
economic
freedom,
not
only
for
darlington,
but
for
all
americans.
the
chief
industry
of
my
state,
north
carolina
is
the
textile
industry.
some
230,000
of
its
funds
and
dollars
earned
livelihoods
for
themselves
and
their
families
in
the
textile
industry
of
north
carolina.
it
is
obvious
i
think
that
north
carolina
and
every
other
textile
producing
state
and
the
people
of
those
states
would
suffer
drastic
economic
injury.
if
it
should
be
held
in
this
case
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
the
power
under
any
circumstances
to
compel
a
textile
manufacturer
to
remain
in
business
against
his
will
until
the
last
drop
of
economic
blood
was
squeezed
from
him.
i
say
this
because
such
an
adjudication
would
minimize
to
the
highest
degree
the
creation
of
future
jobs
in
the
textile
industry,
because
it
would
discourage
new
capital
investments
in
the
textile
industry
and
it
would
eliminate
thousands
of
jobs
now
in
the
textile
industry
by
spurring
the
dissolution
of
textile
plants
of
a
marginal
nature
and
by
stimulating
and
accelerating
the
omitted
automation
in
the
highest
degree
of
all
other
existing
textile
plants.
as
the
lawyer
for
darlington,
i
fight
for
the
preservation
of
economic
freedom
for
all
americans,
and
i
fight
to
protect
north
carolina
and
all
other
textile
producing
states
and
their
people
against
serious,
drastic,
economic
injury.
now,
it
will
do
well
for
me
to
make
it
plain,
what
is
not
involved
in
this
case,
i
think
that
mr.
manoli
has
well
admitted
that
darlington
is
not
a
runaway
corporation.
the
trial
examiner
found
as
a
fact
that
darlington
went
out
of
business
completely,
permanently
and
irrevocably
and
that
no
evidence
was
produced
on
the
hearings
indicating
that
his
business
was
being
carried
on
by
any
of
the
other
corporations
using
the
services
of
deering
milliken
as
a
sales
agent
in
any
other
form
or
in
any
other
place.
that
finding
was
approved
by
the
board
itself,
the
board
said
as
approved
all
of
the
findings
of
the
trial
examiner
except
those,
which
is
specifically
rejected
and
it
did
not
reject
that
specific
finding.
and
when
this
case
was
before
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
laid
this
matter
to
rest
for
all
time
by
this
statement,
which
appears
upon
page
686
of
its
opinion
as
reported
in
(325
f.2d)
item
325
federal
report
of
second
series.
the
trial
examiner
demonstrated
beyond
debate,
that
darlington
was
not
a
runaway
plant,
that
is
a
plant
having
another
existence
in
another
form,
finding
that
darlington
was
not
hidden
among
the
other
milliken
operations.
no
disagreement
with
this
finding
was
or
on
substantial
evidence
could
have
been
made
--
could
have
been
expressed
by
the
board
that
--
now
those
two
questions,
there
are
two
questions
involved
in
this
case.
the
first
is
whether
darlington,
darlington's
complete
and
final
withdrawal
from
business
was
a
violation
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
second,
whether
darlington's
withdrawal
from
business
even
though
final
and
complete
was
a
violation
of
the
act,
because
of
relationships
alleged
to
exist
between
darlington
on
the
one
hand
and
deering
milliken
as
well
as
certain
other
corporations
on
the
other.
it's
my
purpose
as
the
counsel
for
darlington
to
argue
the
first
of
these
questions?
the
second
will
be
argued
in
detailed
by
mr.
updike.
i
shall
merely
allude
to
the
second
question
by
calling
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
fact
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
itself
laid
down
the
correct
rules
for
determining
whether
there
is
a
single
employer
status
existing
between
darlington
and
all
of
these
other
mills.
incidentally,
the
national
labor
relations
act
would
require
the
employment
of
these
people
dischargement
in
darlington
eight
years
ago,
by
sixteen
other
separate
corporations,
which
have
not
been
made
parties
to
this
case
and
haven't
been
given
notice
of
the
case
and
have
been
given
no
opportunity
to
be
heard,
which
seems
to
me
is
enough
to
cause
daniel
webster
to
call
in
his
definition,
the
procedural
due
process
in
the
dartmouth
college
case
to
turn
over
in
his
grave.
here's
what
the
national
labor
relations
board
correctly
said
about
the
single
employer
status.
it
is
now
well
established
that
for
two
or
more
big
remittances
to
constitute
a
single
employer
for
purposes
of
assessing
liability
for
unfair
labor
practices,
it
must
be
shown
that
there
was
a
sufficient
degree
of
common
ownership
and
common
control
of
labor
relations
and
operations
so
that
they
maybe
said
to
have
--
that
they
engaged
in
a
common
enterprise.
every
law
book
i
have
ever
seen
and
every
dictionary
i've
ever
consulted,
says
that
in
order
for
two
or
more
persons
to
be
engaged
in
a
common
enterprise,
they
must
have
the
right
equivalent
to
control
and
direct
that
common
enterprise.
and
yet
to
say
darlington
is
engaged
in
a
common
enterprise
with
sixteen
other
manufacturing
corporations
and
it
didn't
have
any
power
to
control
it
and
which
it
never
did
control,
we
have
a
research
corporation
which
it
couldn't
control,
we
have
an
engineering
corporation
or
service
corporation
which
it
didn't
control
and
whose
services
was
not
obliged
to
take
and
with
the
sales
agent,
deering
milliken.
there
is
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
this
case
that
darlington
had
any
control
over
any
of
those
other
corporations.
furthermore,
there
was
no
common
ownership,
the
stock
in
darlington
was
owned
--
31%
of
it
was
owned
by
people
who
were
not
named
milliken,
who
were
not
related
to
millikens
by
blood
or
marriage.
and
who
didn't
have
so
far
as
this
evidence
shows
a
single
penny
invested
in
any
of
the
enterprise
in
which
any
other
milliken
was
involved,
31%.
and
when
it
came
to
a
vote
to
dissolve
this
corporation,
there
were
200
stockholders
not
related
in
any
way
to
millikens
and
not
involved
in
any
way
with
these
other
19
corporations.
and
of
that
200,
only
four
appeared
in
personal
by
proxy
to
vote
against
dissolution.
and
one
of
these
people
who
appeared
was
mr.
simpson,
a
merchant.
head
of
the
simpson
belt
stores
in
darlington
and
who
represented,
as
i
recall,
and
through
the
record,
approximate
20,000
shares
of
stock
beneficially
or
personally
and
who
voted
to
liquidate
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
the
prosperity
of
his
mercantile
establishment
was
dependent
on
the
prosperity
of
darlington.
people
don't
cut
off
their
economic
noses
despite
their
economic
face
or
the
economic
faces
of
anybody
else.
all
the
desires
of
labor,
they
don't
do
it,
and
just
to
show
that
there's
no
common
ownership,
darlington
was
an
isolated
mill.
there's
one
other
mill,
one
of
these
mills
in
that
neighborhood
and
and
that
was
arch.
and
if
this
order
of
the
labor
board
was
carried
out
to
compel
these
other
men
to
offer
employment
to
these
people,
most
of
them
would
go
to
hartsford
because
it's
the
nearest
one.
and
the
evidence
shows
that
45%
of
the
stock
in
hartsford
was
owned
by
people
who
were
not
millikens,
who
were
not
related
to
the
millikens,
and
so
far
as
the
evidence
shows
did
not
even
have
a
penny
invested
in
any
other
enterprise
in
which
any
milliken
was
entrusted.
now,
the
truth
of
it
is,
this
court
should
hold
as
a
matter
of
law
on
the
evidence
in
this
case
that
the
cause
of
darlington's
going
out
of
business
was
economic.
the
trial
examiner
would
have
held
that
if
he
had
not
been
mistaken
as
to
the
law
applicable
to
this
case.
he
said
this,
volume
i
page
65,
he's
speaking
of
the
economic
factors,
which
darlington
had
insisted,
showed
that
this
mill
went
out
of
business
for
economic
reasons
and
not
for
discriminatory
purposes.
the
trial
examiner
says
these
factors
--
the
factors
cited
were
sufficient
to
support
a
decision
to
terminate
operations,
certainly
it
cannot
be
said
that
such
a
decision
could
not
reasonably
or
even
unreasonably,
but
credibly
would
be
based
on
these
factors.
then
he
added,
proceeded
further,
he
concluded
that
the
decision
to
close
darlington
could
not
be
held
to
be
based
on
economic
factors.
although,
the
economic
factors
justified
as
closing,
because
he
said,
“the
decision
to
close
would
not
then
have
been
made.”
if
it
has
not
been,
“for
the
union's
victory.”
in
other
words,
the
trial
examiner
said
this,
the
economic
situation
was
sufficient
to
justify
a
closing.
but,
because
they
closed
on
that
day,
as
a
result
prompted,
the
decelerating
cause,
the
last
one
could
follow
the
group
on
camel's
back
was
the
union
victory
and
because
it
didn't
operate
until
the
sun
rose
and
set
a
few
more
times,
he
couldn't
hold
that
it
was
economic
in
nature.
and
when
the
case
came
before
the
board,
the
board
made
a
similar
situation.
mr.
irving
abramson
i
think
it
shows
it
is
critical.
mr.
irving
abramson
no,
that's
not
critical
to
my
case,
because
i'm
just
saying
no,
that
this
court
ought
to
end
this
case
by
holding
as
a
matter
of
law
in
this
evidence,
that
it
due,
the
closing
was
due
to
economic
causes,
but
of
course
i
would
say
in
the
next
place
is
not
critical,
because
the
power
of
congress
to
regulate
the
labor
relations
between
the
employers
and
employees
is
based
solely
upon
the
interstate
commerce
clause
and
congress
has
the
power
to
regulate
the
conduct
as
long
as
they
are
engaged
in
the
interstate
commerce
or
in
an
industry
affecting
interstate
commerce.
but,
they
have
the
privilege
of
withdrawing
themselves
from
business
and
withdrawing
themselves
from
the
regulatory
power
of
congress
and
it's
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
attempted
to
provide
for
the
regulation
and
to
compel
people
remain
in
business
after
they
had
to
go
back
into
business
after
they
had
withdrawn
from
business.
it
would
exceed
the
power
of
congress
onto
the
constitution.
i
think
that's
clear.
mr.
irving
abramson
that's
right,
any
reason.
mr.
irving
abramson
but
at
least
i
was
arguing
this
and
the
more
detailed
problems
and
i
should,
was
a
fact
that
the
reason
the
trial
examiner
reached
the
conclusion
he
did.
and
the
reason
the
board
reached
the
conclusion
that
they
had,
they
had
thought
that
as
a
matter
of
law
they
could
not
consider
the
union
victory
as
an
economic
event
under
any
circumstances.
and
therefore,
and
since
it
participated
in
the
decision
to
some
degree,
that
therefore
they
had
to
hold,
it
was
an
illegal
discriminatory
closing.
now,
the
facts
of
this
case,
show
it
is
economic.
this
is
the
old
mill,
it
was
built
about
the
time
that
grover
cleveland
was
inaugurated
president
of
the
united
states
for
the
first
time.
it
had
become
practically
obsolete
before
the
1930's
depression.
and
during
the
1930's
depression
it
became
indebted
to
a
sales
agent,
milliken
deering
and
that's
the
only
capacity
milliken
deering
has
as
to
darlington.
and
it
was
put
into
bankruptcy
and
it
would
have
gone
out
of
existence,
staying
except
for
the
fact
that
milliken
deering
agreed
to
take
its
debts
in
stock.
that's
the
way
they
became
acquainted
with
this
mill.
now,
the
textile
industry
flourished
during
the
second
world
war
for
three
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
the
government
bought
up
most
of
their
products.
in
the
second
place,
they
had
no
foreign
competition.
in
the
third
place,
there
was
no
price
competition,
because
the
old
pa
fixed
prices
on
all
of
their
products.
as
soon
as
the
war
was
over,
there
was
a
period
that
comprised
of
prosperity
in
which
anybody
with
a
textile
mill
could
make
some
money,
because
there
was
a
great
backlog
of
all
the
civilian
demand.
it
had
been
prevented
from
being
fulfilled
by
the
law.
but,
after
that
there
came
a
period
of
decline
in
the
textile
industry
and
it
became
a
sick
industry.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
since
1946,
the
close
of
the
second
world
war,
the
jobs
of
440,000
textile
workers
have
been
liquidated
and
gone
out
of
existence
in
the
united
states.
one-third
at
least
have
gone
out
as
a
result
of
the
closing
of
670
separate
textile
plants
of
a
marginal
character
like
darlington.
and
the
other
two-thirds
have
gone
out
as
a
result
of
automation
and
the
more
efficient
use
of
labor
by
reason
of
new
machineries.
now,
darlington,
during
the
--
two
years
before
darlington
went
out
of
existence,
we
had
a
cut
in
the
tax
on
textiles.
it
was
the
theory
of
those
in
control
that
we
had
to
keep
a
viable
economy
among
our
allies,
japan
in
particular.
and
so,
they
cut
the
tax
on
textiles
and
an
additional
25%
to
50%,
this
was
following
many
other
cuts
that
had
been
made
since
the
passage
of
the
reciprocal
trade
agreements
act
and
it
almost
brought
the
tax
down
to
nothing.
and
then
two
years
later
in
january
of
1946,
the
united
states
adopted
a
policy
under
which
by
an
export
subsidy
on
cotton
of
foreign
competitors
of
darlington
and
other
mills
could
buy
cotton
of
american
government
in
effect
of
people
getting
the
subsidy
of
american
government,
$0.06.5,
$0.07.5
and
$0.08
a
pound.
they
bought
their
cotton
at
75%
of
the
price
that
which
american
textile
product
producers
or
manufacturers
had
to
buy.
and
that
took
effect
in
january
1956.
now,
two
years
before
darlington
went
out
of
business,
there
was
an
increase
of
over
200
--
of
over
125%
in
the
imports
of
textiles
of
the
character
that
darlington
was
manufacturing.
and
at
the
same
time,
there
had
been
rehabilitation
lodged
at
the
dispense
of
the
american
taxpayers
on
the
aid
programs
of
all
of
the
old
textile
industries
of
the
free
world
and
then
they
had
expanded
this
industry
into
the
undeveloped
countries.
and
they
had
modern
cotton
mills
with
modern
machinery
largely
bought
from
american,
the
american
foreign
aid
program
and
they
could
get
new
mills
for
50%
of
the
cost
of
american
replacements
at
that
time.
and
during
1954,
two
years
before
darlington
went
out
of
business,
there
were
94
textile
plants
which
went
out
of
existence.
the
next
year,
101
and
the
following
year
about
100
or
more.
and
so,
this
was
a
very
hardest
period
on
the
textile
business.
now,
darlington
considered
going
out
of
business.
the
year
before
the
union
appeared
upon
the
scene
and
to
make
--
they
considered
seriously
and
finally
called
in
an
independent
engineering
firm,
bates
firm,
and
they
made
a
survey
of
the
mills.
darlington
had
concluded
that
the
only
possible
way
that
it
could
stay
in
business
was
to
have
modern
machinery
and
to
have
--
make
a
more
effective
use
of
this
labor.
and
so,
darlington
called
in
this
engineering
firm,
because
darlington,
only
had
been
making
two
and
eight
tenth
percent
upon
this
investment
during
those
years.
and
so,
they
called
in
this
firm
and
this
firm
said
that
the
mill
floors
was
sold
in
such
a
condition,
so
insufficiently
constructed
and
so
antiquated
that
they
would
not
stand
the
vibration
of
high
speed
modern
textile
machinery.
so,
darlington
embarked
then
on
a
program
that
was
contemplated
an
expenditure
of
$400,000
to
modernize
its
mill
and
it
took
in
full
concrete
flooring
to
support
some
of
these
looms,
to
have
the
modern
speed
looms
and
what
had
been
a
supply
room
on
the
ground
floor,
because
the
other
floors
of
the
building
had
been
in
use
wouldn't
support
them,
according
to
the
engineering
firm.
and
it
was
embarked
on
this
expenditure
of
$400,000
recognizing
that
they
had
the
modernize
machinery
and
they
had
to
make
a
more
efficient
use
of
the
labor,
which
the
union
called
a
stretch
out.
and
so
they
came
--
the
people,
there
was
a
substantial
minority
which
opposed
any
change
in
job
assignments.
they
wanted
the
management
to
carry
on
in
the
old
way
and
although
darlington
spent
thousands
of
dollars
in
an
attempt
to
modernize
its
carving
room
and
its
spinning
room,
that
it
didn't
get
the
economic
results
from
it,
because
of
the
reluctance
of
the
minority
of
these
employees
to
do
--
to
engage
in
a
more
efficient
labor
and
the
use
of
more
machinery.
now,
this
was
a
substantial
outlay
for
darlington,
because
this
total
property
at
that
time
was
betted
at
only
$2,100,000.
and
so,
then
the
union
came
up
on
the
scene
and
started
the
organizing
campaign
just
about
the
time
that
the
results
of
the
american,
of
the
subsidy
program
started
to
take
an
effect.
and
the
union
promised
these
people
and
they
won
the
election
on
the
basis
of
their
promises
that
they
would
see
to
it
that
the
management
made
no
changes
in
the
job
assignments
there.
in
other
words,
the
union
pledged
these
people
that
darlington,
that
it
would,
if
the
union
won,
they
told
them
that
if
the
union
won,
that
darlington
could
never
go
out
of
business
not
even
until
the
last
lingering
echo
of
gabriel's
horn
sounded.
they
told
them
that
they'll
see
that,
that
the
only
program
that
was
possible
to
save
darlington
economically
was
never
cut
out.
that
is
the
more
efficient
use
of
labor
in
connection
with
new
machinery
and
as
a
result
of
the
decline
on
the
products
of
darlington,
they
discovered
that
they
were
suffering
a
substantial
loss
because
there
was
a
decrease
of
$0.06
a
pound
in
the
7900
pounds
of
textile
products
they
produced
during
the
period
between
january
and
september
of
1956.
in
addition
to
that,
the
administration
had
promised
to
do
something
about
the
importation
of
cheaply
manufactured
textile
products
from
abroad,
the
rest
was
all
from
japan
where
the
workers
got
$0.12.5
an
hour
or
10%
of
that
then
paid
in
the
american
industry
and
that
area
of
this
country.
and
as
a
result
of
that
promise,
the
sort
of
manufacturers
agreed
that
they'll
have
a
general
raise.
and
as
darlington
had
stayed
in
business,
even
in
the
absence
of
the
union,
it
would
have
made,
had
to
have
made
an
increase
in
pay
to
the
conform
to
the
general
peace
throughout
the
industry
that
would
have
amounted
to
$120,
$1000
a
year.
now
darlington,
had
been
making
about
$80,000
a
year
which
is
less
than
two
and
eight-tenths
percent
on
this
investment
during
the
preceding
five
years.
and
if
it
is
going
to
account
as
a
modernization
program,
it
not
only
had
to
make
this
expenditure
of
above
$400,000,
but
it
had
to
take
in
effect
other
expenditures,
because
with
the
change
of
technology
and
with
the
change
of
styles
and
with
automation,
there's
a
great
change
that
had
come
into
the
industry.
for
example,
darlington
had
been
specializing
among
other
things
in
the
making
of
pk
and
as
a
result
of
the
technological
change,
his
competitors
had
bought
machinery
in
which
they
could
avoid
the
expenses
as
the
manufacturer.
buy
new
machines
through
which
they
could
run
any
kind
of
cheaply
made
cloth
and
make
the
same
effect,
get
the
same
effect
as
pk
without
the
elaborate
processes
which
darlington
had.
furthermore,
the
customers
on
the
market
stopped
buying
--
became
in
this
favor,
the
woven
cloth
upon
the
narrow
looms,
the
only
kind
darlington
had.
and
as
a
part
of
this
program
for
modernization
it
had
purchased
and
had
on
hand
at
that
time
for
installation
in
the
newly
concreted
portion
of
the
supply
room,
80
looms
which
was
about
10%
of
the
number
of
looms
it
had,
the
wide
looms
that
it
could
operate.
now,
on
top
of
this,
they
found
themselves
confronted
by
the
necessity
even
in
the
absence
of
the
union
of
increasing
wages
of
$120,000.
they
found
they
were
going
to
sustain
a
loss
as
a
result
of
the
decline
of
their
products
of
$240,000.
then,
they
also
knew
that
they
were
going
to
have
to
spend
$800,000
in
the
near
future
if
they
stayed
in
business
to
air-condition
the
plant
and
make
other
vast
improvements
in
order
to
increase
the
wide
looms
above
80,
the
number
80
they
didn't
have
on
hand.
and
on
top
of
this
situation,
this
company
was
confronted
by
the
advent
of
the
union,
which
had
pledged
itself
to
the
people
that
had
voted
for
them
to
see
to
it
that
the
plans
which
darlington
had
and
which
was
the
only
plans
that
could
possibly
permit
darlington
to
remain
in
existence
as
an
economic
unity
were
never
carried
out.
and
on
the
face
of
that
fact,
the
trial
examiner
and
the
board
took
the
position
that
they
had
to
ignore
the
existence
of
the
union.
and
if
they
considered
the
advent
of
the
union
upon
the
scene
as
an
economic
factor
in
association
with
these
other
economic
factors
and
reach
the
decision
they
couldn't
operate
economically
that,
that
was
an
unfair
labor
practice,
that's
the
holding
of
this
board,
that's
what
it
says
the
basis
of
it.
it
says
it
had
six
genuine,
that
darlington
had
six
genuine
economic
reasons
apart
from
the
advent
of
the
union
for
going
out
of
business
at
that
time.
but,
it
held
and
violated
section
8(a)(3)
of
that
in
going
out
of
business
completely
and
permanently
and
in
good
faith.
now,
i
respectfully
submit
that
this
court
ought
to
hold
in
the
first
place
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
this
going
out
of
business
was
based
on
economic
conditions
and
that
the
decision
of
the
trial
examiner
and
the
decision
of
the
board
to
the
contrary
was
based
upon
the
misconstruction
of
law,
because
there
are
at
least
12
cases
we
cite
in
our
brief
that
says
that
an
employer
can
take
in
consideration
the
advent
of
the
union
as
an
economic
fact
in
determining
whether
it's
possible
for
him
to
stay
in
business
on
an
economic
stand
point.
then,
i
say
this,
that
congress
recognized
that
it
only
had
this,
the
power
to
pass
this
act
on
to
the
interstate
commerce
clause,
and
they
don't
have
the
right
to
make
regulations
of
employers,
litigation
in
private
business
as
long
as
they
elected
to
engage
in
interstate
commerce
or
in
an
industry
affecting
the
interstate
commerce.
and
congress
knew
that
when
they
went
out
of
business,
that
their
power
to
regulate
ceased.
now,
this
is
not
a
case
that
involves
the
power
of
congress
to
create
a
crime
or
a
cause
of
action
while
one
is
engaged
in
interstate
commerce,
which
will
survive
the
going
out
of
interstate
commerce.
that
was
no
discharge
of
any
employees
here
for
discriminatory
reasons
that
is
for
the
union
activities,
the
only
reason
that
these
people
were
discharged
because
their
services
were
no
longer
needed
for
the
operation
of
the
mill,
which
was
going
out
of
business
and
when
this
bill
was
before
the
congress,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
during
the
debate
on
the
house
floor,
that
congressman
taylor
of
tennessee.
mr.
irving
abramson
--
if
it
please
the
court.
i
will
prevail
on
the
court
to
utilize
the
two
minutes
that
i
have
to
pick
up
the
discussion
which
just
left
off
and
in
that
connection,
i
direct
the
court's
attention
if
it
pleases
to
volume
6
in
the
transcript
of
record
page
1916,
wherein
the
court
of
appeals
amended
its
original
decision.
in
the
original
opinion
of
the
court
below,
the
court
said
that
the
manufacturing
done
at
darlington
was
not
transferred
to
the
other
mills
when
darlington
was
shut
down.
thus
in
the
original
form,
the
decision
below
in
part
read
“it
is
noteworthy
that
darlington
was
the
only
milliken-related
plant
manufacturing
clean-cloth
and
since
its
liquidation,
none
of
the
remaining
mills
has
undertaken
the
manufacture
of
that
kind
of
product.”
that
was
deleted
in
the
final
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
obviously
because
that's
an
incorrect
finding.
mr.
irving
abramson
page
1916,
mr.
justice
black
of
volume
6
of
the
transcript
of
the
record,
reflects
this
deletion
of
the
original
opinion.
furthermore,
deering
milliken
mills
began
to
make
cloth
of
two
types
theretofore
made
only
by
darlington.
the
rest
of
the
milliken
mills
never
made
this
type
of
cloth,
only
darlington
made
it.
but
after
darlington
mills
were
shut
down,
that
work
then
was
taken
up
by
deering
milliken.
and
one
other
point
which
reflects
an
interest
by
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
white
with
the
respect
to
the
findings
by
this
board
and
i
direct
your
honors'
attention
to
page
25
of
the
findings
of
the
board
wherein
it
says,
“roger
milliken's
participation
is
in
the
area
having
the
greatest
impact
on
labor
relations
in
the
area
of
collective
bargaining.”
then
the
board
says,
“thus,
he
circulated
a
memorandum
and
editorial
which
was
obviously
intended
as
a
primer
to
the
managers
of
the
mills
in
combating
union
organization.
thus,
the
organizational
campaign
--
during
the
organizational
campaign,
his
pervasive
influence
was
demonstrated
by
the
statements
of
supervisory
employees
that
roger
milliken
would
close
the
plant
rather
than
permit
its
unionization.”
mr.
irving
abramson
i
do
so,
very
definitely
--
and
i
tie
in
this
transcript
that
we've
read.
mr.
irving
abramson
it
is
true
that
the
board
could
have
said
a
lot
of
things
perhaps
more
explicitly,
but
the
primer
refers
to
on
its
face,
is
headed.
the
object
lesson
of
the
closing
to
the
darlington
mills
and
that
object
lesson
was
sent
to
the
heads
of
each
of
the
other
darlington
mills,
it
couldn't
be
any
plain
of
message.
mr.
irving
abramson
that's
an
accurate
statement,
yes.
we'd
merely
presume
that
the
purpose
of
the
communication
that
has
thoroughly
stated
in
the
memorandum
of
roger
milliken,
this
is
interesting,
you
ought
to
know
about
it
and
give
it
to
the
community.
and
we
assume
therefore
that
if
the
managers
of
the
mills
followed
roger
milliken's
instructions,
they
would
have
given
it
to
the
community
which
includes
the
work
that
was
done
in
deering
milliken
plants.
mr.
irving
abramson
i
think
this
is
a
critical
question
mr.
justice
harlan
please.
in
that
--
and
i
would
suggest
the
answer
to
that
is
this.
like
many
other
violations
of
the
law,
the
sole
and
exclusive
criteria
is
motivation.
an
employer
may
give
a
wage
increase
to
an
employee
and
not
violate
the
law.
but
if
that
wage
increase
is
given
to
the
employee
for
discriminatory
purposes,
he
violates
the
law.
an
employer
may
discharge
an
employee
without
violating
the
law,
but
if
the
purpose
is
--
is
a
discriminatory
discharge,
he's
in
violation
of
section
883.
and
therefore,
i
--
maybe
i'm
getting
around
the
circle,
but
getting
therefore
to
your
honor's
question,
if
the
motivation
of
closing
down
the
plant
is
for
the
purpose
of
committing
a
violation
of
the
law
namely
to
frustrate
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining,
then
the
fifth
--
central
trust
of
the
closing
down
is
to
violate
the
law
and
therefore
it
becomes
unlawful.
mr.
irving
abramson
well,
this
--
i
hope
i'm
not
presumptuous
in
suggesting
that
it's
elemental.
the
trial
examiner
found
very
conclusively
that
if
an
employer
is
permitted
to
close
down
the
plant,
it
undercuts
the
underlying
principles
of
the
right
of
collective
bargaining.
there
isn't
a
single
officer,
be
it
administrative
or
judicial
of
the
many
people
that
handled
this
case
that
if
it
is
agreed
with
the
proposition
that
the
finding
that
this
plant
was
closed
down
for
illegal
purposes
was
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
not
a
single
officer,
judicial
or
administrative.
and
the
cases
a
clear,
they
are
legion
to
suggest
that
the
--
if
you
have
a
illegal
purpose
in
shutting
down,
it
becomes
a
violation
of
the
law.
we
cite
a
dozen
cases
in
our
briefs
to
that
effect.
thank
you,
your
honor.
