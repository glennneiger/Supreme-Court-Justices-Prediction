mr.
manoli,
you
may
proceed
to
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
say
the
question
being
presented,
if
darlington,
at
this
side
of
its
former
business
who
is
the
only
employer
to
buy
and
to
liquidate
it
under
this
circumstance,
that
question
is
not
purported?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
the
basis
of
liquidating
at
the
time
that
this
organization
did,
is
not
a
question
--
i
suppose
it's
not
because
they
had
any
personal
taste
with
the
officers
of
the
union,
but
because
they
thought
unionization
was
uneconomic?
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
ahead.
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
chair
using
this
than
that
of
the
other
claim?

versus

chief
justice
earl
warren
what
case
holds
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
senator,
may
i
ask
this
question
on
your
speaking
about
matters
of
the
heart.
i
notice
in
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
on
page
4,
it
says
this.
“at
the
start
of
the
organizing
campaign,
mill
treasure
olan
promptly
advised
roger
milliken
of
this
activity
by
telephone.
thereafter,
management
engaged
in
a
systematic
and
extensive
effort
to
procure
the
union's
rejection.
on
several
occasions,
threats
were
made
by
second-hands
and
overseers
that
the
mill
would
be
closed
if
the
employees
vote
for
union
representation,
just
as
of
milliken
family
had
previously
closed
a
plant
in
may”
and
then
they
cite
about
a
dozen
pages
from
the
record
to
establish
that,
how
do
you
handle
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
updike.
chief
justice
earl
warren
[inaudible]
in
some
instances
take
over
the
contracts,
did
they
not
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
abramson.
