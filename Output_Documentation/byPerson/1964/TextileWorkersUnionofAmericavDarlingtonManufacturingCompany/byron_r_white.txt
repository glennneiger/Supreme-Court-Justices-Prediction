the
only
evidence
mr.
manoli
is
that
only
the
production
of
that
mill
wound
up
another
mills
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
much
of
the
--
do
you
have
any
idea
how
much
of
the
production
ended
up
with
--
are
you
really
claiming
this
is
a
runaway
plant?
justice

the
darlington
mill
was
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
some
suggestion
in
the
record
that
there's
a
hierarchy
in
the
family,
so
that
the
control
lies
somewhere
in
the
family?
justice
byron
r.
white
these
really
different
people
with
independent
existences?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
mr.
manoli,
first
overall
situations
in
which
the
business
went
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
we're
talking
about
the
prerogative
is
going
out
of
business.
we
need
talk
about
any
other
prerogative?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
the
consequence
of
this
management's
decision
upon
employment
and
organization
in
the
other
plants
of
the
complex?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
some
evidence
that
after
the
election
and
after
the
announcement
of
liquidation,
83%
of
the
employees
said,
don't
liquidate
them,
we
will
forget
the
union
or
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
evidence
--
with
the
evidence
to
this
a
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
had
some
sort
of
survey
as
i
remember
from
experts
in
survey,
is
that
prior
to
the
mode
of
aspect?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
they
had
some
expert
who
came
in
--
somebody
to
make
a
survey
of
plant?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
letter
might
have
been
a
sample
of
whether
the
mill
closed
down
or
not.
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
kind
of
an
expression
of
the
point
view
about
that
organizations,
i
think
the
employer
is
fully
trying
to
make
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
evidence
that
the
--
this
message
got
the
workers
to
distinguish
from
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
have
been
your
position
if
milliken
decided
to
let
total
suicide
a
lot
of
business
entirely
out
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
that
assumes
the
closing
of
the
mill
down
was
an
offense
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
below
couldn't
–-
didn't
see
that
so
fairly
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
employer
verbalizes
his
decision
in
terms
of
economic.
he
just
knows
from
experience
of
some
observation
that
a
unionized
plant
could
have
cost
him
more
money
and
he
isn't
going
to
put
up
with
that.
and
he
closes
down,
would
you
say
you
had
a
different
case
there
or
not?
i
assume
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
this
critical
to
your
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
this
wasn't
an
economic
--
let's
assume
the
board's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
for
any
of
–-
do
you
say,
whether
it
is
for
economic
or
any
other
reason
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
at
least
you
say,
in
this
case
it
was
economic.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least
it's
very
clear
that
no
findings
whatsoever
by
any
court
or
agency
or
examiner
in
regard
to
motivation
with
regard
to
other
plants?
