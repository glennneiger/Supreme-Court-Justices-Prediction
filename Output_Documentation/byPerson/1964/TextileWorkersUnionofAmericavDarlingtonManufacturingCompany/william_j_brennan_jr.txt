is
there
a
finding
on
that,
no
finding
whether
it
was
10,
15,
50
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
where
the
contracting
out
it
went
on
another
form,
but
still
the
same
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
told
us
that,
that's
not
the
case
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
there
fair
on
whether
his
reason
for
liquidation
is
economic?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
can't
believe
it.
he
might
keep
those
reasons,
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
remedy
do
you
propose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
remedy
do
you
propose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
ahead
of
me
mr.
ervin
and
i
got
volume
5
which
begins
in
1239
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
appendix
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
get
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
senator
may
i
ask
you
if
this
were
a
company
with
a
number
of
plant,
a
single
company
with
a
number
of
plants,
is
your
argument
based
on
the
legislative
history
go
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
it
would
not
be
an
unfair
labor
practice,
with
such
a
company
to
close
down
one
plant
to
force
all
organization
as
other
plants?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
the
cases
hold
that
even
though
he
closes
it
down
to
force
all
organization
of
other
plants?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
cases
that
senator
referred
to
the
rapid
boundary
and
that
doesn't
seem
to
have
going
to
factor
in
that
case,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
updike
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
the
exhibit
to
which
we
referred
yesterday
or
call
the
notice
of
the
magazine
article
in
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
put
that
in,
the
board
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
particular
circulation
to
the
treasurer,
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
the
other
plants
that
followed
after
the
closing
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[voice
overlap]
whether
it
was
a
board
of
the
union
at
the
any
time
when
these
proceedings
below,
relied
upon
that
circulation
as
proof
that
the
closing
of
darlington
was
for
the
purpose
of
forestalling
organization
of
the
other
plants?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
abramson,
do
you
need
that
as
the
fact
saying
that
darlington
was
closed
down,
for
among
other
reasons
to
forestall
organizations
at
the
other
deering
milliken
plant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
they
might
have
been
said
more
explicitly,
if
that's
what
the
finding
intends,
would
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
you
told
me
yesterday
that
while
the
evidence
showed
that
that
went
to
the
heads
of
the
other
mills,
and
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
at
least
that
in
fact
that
circulation
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
any
employees
of
the
other
mills.
