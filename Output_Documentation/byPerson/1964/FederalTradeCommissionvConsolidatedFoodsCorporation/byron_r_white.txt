justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
say
it's
consolidated's
function
as
a
distributor,
as
a
purchaser
and
a
distributor
of
a
food
products
that
is
relevant
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
its
function
as
a
retailer
of
foods.(voice
overlap)
i
take
it
had
a
chain
of
retail
stores.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
am
just
wondering
is
this
important
whether
or
not
the
possession
of
consolidate
as
a
wholesaler,
as
a
wholesaler
food,
was
a
deteriorating
one
or
an
increasing
one
or
what
is
the
position
of
a
food
wholesaler
these
days
is
the
trend
directly
from
manufacturer
to
retailer?
is
this
just
an
attempt
to
stay
in
business
for
a
diversifying
or
a
really
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
a
distributor's
leverage
really
very
big?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
lets
assume
if
i
am
a
food
distributor
and
i
just
have
not
send
this
as
a
true
consolidator,
but
if
i
happen
to
be
convinced
that
--
or
i
think
that
food
distributor's
days
are
numbered
but
if
i
want
to
stay
in
business
i
better
be
getting
in
some
other
line
of
business
too,
i
might
try
food
manufacturing
plant
and
just
to
stay
in
business
i
may
--
may
be
i
may
be
on
the
way
out
of
the
distributor
--
justice
byron
r.
white
-–
as
a
distributor.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
even
if
what
i
suggest
was
true,
if
it
was
a
large
enough
retailer
of
food,
if
they
had
a
--
why
–
it
would
still
have
the
purchasing
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
record
show
any
special
reasons
why
consolidator's
ownership?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
more
selling
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
records
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
attempt
in
the
record
to
assign
a
cause
for
either
one
of
those
changes?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
it
would
i
take
it
that
your
position
would
be
that
[inaudible]
justice
byron

justice
byron

justice
byron

[inaudible]
justice

it
would

[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
it
is
wrong
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
not
with
standing
the
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
walker,
i
take
it
that
if
gentry
--
let's
assume
gentry
has
50%
of
the
market,
is
it
merged
--
say
out
of
horizontal
merger
with
another
company
in
the
same
business
puccinelli
or
whatever
it
is,
but
assume
that
company
had
5%
of
the
market,
i
take
it
under
our
cases
that
it
would
be
a
rather
suspected
merger,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
a
whole
lot
of
investigations
as
to
consequences
in
the
market.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
that
because
gentry
was
--
just
any
of
the
significant
addition
to
its
already
existing
power
is
--
he
had
some
problems
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
gentry
then,
instead
being
acquired
by
someone
who
might
very
easily
or
even
probably
add
5%
to
its
market
share?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
little
different.
that's
emphasizing
the
gentry's
market
position
rather
than
the
reciprocity.
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
the
mr.
solicitor
general
referred
to
that
same
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
on
page
64?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
have
a
chart
for
showing
that
what
the
share
of
sale
to
these
companies
were
in
1951?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
for
the
moment
in
each
group,
in
each
of
these
–
in
each
group
of
these
companies
1951
were
buying
less
and
than
they
are
buying
in
57,
it
would
be
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
this
prove?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
just
an
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
just
an
argument,
and
if
the
facts
were
that
that
all
of
these
companies
were
buying
less
in
1951
than
were
in
1957,
i
think
the
case
would
considerably
be
different?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
a
percentage
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
and
so
we
don't
really
know
about
[inaudible]
on
a
percentage
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
really
so
effective?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
walker,
i
understand
your
argument
to
be
that
consolidated
used
all
the
power
it
had?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
what
the
result
would
be
if
it
had?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
i
ask
you
if
they
used
all
the
power
you
have
and
you
said
you
want
to
argue
they
haven't,
and
you
said
that
you
weren't
that
that
they
weren't.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
they
were
using
all
the
power
they
had?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
gentry
or
the
consolidated
did
ask.
you're
assuming
and
record
shows
that,
although
the
record
show
that
not
only
did
consolidated
just
deny
that
it
went
out
and
attempted
to
use
reciprocal
buying.
justice
byron
r.
white
deny
it
or
use
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
had
consolidated
ever
denied
that
it
used
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
record,
do
you
think
the
record
shows
that
that
to
the
extent
consolidated
thought
it
might
have
any
power,
it
really
tried
to
use
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
your
theory.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
have
a
tough
time
denying
it,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
one
other
question?
was
this
the
stock
or
an
asset
acquisition?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
wouldn't
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
didn't
understand
your
oral
argument
that
way.
i
understand
–
i
understood
your
oral
argument
to
zero
in
reciprocity
as
such.
i
was
mistaken.
and
i
take
it
then
you
would
[inaudible]
if
puccinelli
had
been
acquired
here
rather
than
gentry,
you
wouldn't
be
here
arguing
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
real
question
is,
the
real
question
is
that's
not
the
position
you
are
taking
as
if
they
required
puccinelli
as
in
seen
stock
acquisition,
that
was
a
subsidiary
and
there
was
actual
reciprocity
operated.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
section
1
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
section
1.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
will
probably
lose?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
just
suggesting
reciprocity
as
such,
proper
effective
reciprocity
as
such
does
not
violate
anything
except
section
--
justice
byron
r.
white
section
5?
justice
byron
r.
white
puccinelli
came
to
consolidated
as
independent
company
and
said
look
why
don't
you
our
–
how
did
we
get
together
here
and
you
don't
need
your
suppliers
at
all.
let's
just
agree
that
you
will
try
to
get
us
some
customers.
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
not
exactly,
what
i
[inaudible]
reason
there
would
be
because
the
typical
buying
power
[inaudible]
in
the
agreement.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
and
if
they
had
acquired
the
stock
of
puccinelli
and
they
have
that
sort
of
arrangement
being
the
parent
and
the
sub
with
that
kind
of
an
operation,
i
wouldn't
think
--
i
would
think
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
typical
buying
power
that
it
would
be
an
effective
[inaudible]
