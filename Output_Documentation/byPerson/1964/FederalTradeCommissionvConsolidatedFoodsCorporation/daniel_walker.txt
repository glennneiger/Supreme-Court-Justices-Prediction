mr.
daniel
walker
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
justices
of
the
supreme
court.
the
federal
trade
commission
and
the
commentators,
the
solicitor
general
and
both
friends
of
the
court
in
this
case,
persist
in
trying
to
make
it,
i
believe
like
a
test
case
dealing
with
the
legality
of
reciprocity
under
the
antitrust
laws,
the
legality
of
conglomerate
mergers
under
section
7,
and
the
impropriety
of
considering
post-acquisition
evidence
in
the
section
7
case.
i
do
not
believe
that
any
of
these
issues
are
fairly
presented
by
this
case.
i
want
to
say
it
very
simply
now,
and
if
i
may
elaborate
on
it
later,
this
is
basically
a
fact
case.
the
only
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
substantial
reciprocal
buying
will
probably
result
from
the
consolidated-gentry
merger.
in
other
words,
whether
consolidated's
purchases
will
probably
get
sales
of
consequence
for
gentry
among
food
processors.
mr.
daniel
walker
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that
proposition.
it's
–-
mr.
daniel
walker
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
case
that
directly
establishes
it
mr.
justice
white,
but
i
believe
it
to
be
myself
a
position
that
you
in
light
of
the
legislative
history
of
section
7,
and
what
this
court
has
said
about
section
7
and
other
cases
that
i
would
not
want
to
urge
upon
you
the
position
that
if
a
substantial
market
power
is
created
by
a
merger,
be
it
horizontal,
vertical,
conglomerate
or
whatever,
then
that
merger
can
be
reached
by
section
7.
mr.
daniel
walker
precisely.
mr.
daniel
walker
well,
an
argument
could
be
made
as
it
is
currently
being
made
that
the
active
practice
of
reciprocity
either
getting
reciprocal
agreements
or
coercive
reciprocity
is
invalid
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
there
are
cases
pending
on
that.
the
federal
trade
commission--
mr.
daniel
walker
yes
sir.
i
surely
do
concede
that
point
and
i
do
want
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
amicus
curiae
brief
that
has
been
filed
in
support
of
consolidated
and
that
is
why
i
did
not
give
my
consent
to
the
filing
of
that
brief
because
i
do
not
urge
on
this
court,
the
position
that
a
merger
which
creates
a
substantial
reciprocity
power
cannot
be
reached
under
the
antitrust
laws
or
cannot
be
reached
specifically
under
section
7.
mr.
daniel
walker
well
i
suppose.
mr.
daniel
walker
it
surely
does
not.
mr.
daniel
walker
well,
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
white
if
i
may
that
at
least
this
is
the
way
it
seems
to
me
that
a
proper
first
test
is
finding
out
whether
the
issue
was
presented
by
the
case.
if
under
the
facts
of
the
case
there
is
no
probability
of
substantial
reciprocal
buying
then
you
do
not
even
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
if
it
were
present,
it
would
be
invalid.
mr.
daniel
walker
well,
in
just
speaking
for
myself
mr.
justice
white,
i
believe
the
case
to
be
over
at
that
point.
mr.
daniel
walker
i
am
sure
that
the
court
must
consider
that
question.
i
am
just
saying
that
i
do
not
argue
it
to
you.
mr.
daniel
walker
it
would
not
be
a
section
7
case,
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
daniel
walker
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
or
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
case
cannot
be
resolved
by
arguing
that
neighbors
will
buy
tickets
for
each
others
charity
raffles
or
on
the
basis
that
reciprocity
works
in
the
transportation
industry
for
example
where
it's
well
known
that
it
is
long
been
a
way
of
life.
the
issue
here
is
in
a
different
industry
and
it
is
whether,
once
more
consolidated
has
a
purchasing
power
of
consequence
among
food
processors
that
will
force
or
induce
them
to
buy
their
onion
and
garlic
from
gentry.
in
this
argument,
i
should
like
to
tailor
my
remarks
to
the
arguments
specifically
made
by
the
solicitor
general,
both
in
his
brief
and
in
his
oral
argument.
i
hope
to
persuade
the
court
that
this
case
can
only
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
record
before
you
and
i
conceive
it
to
be
my
major
function
in
this
oral
argument
to
persuade
you
that
that
record
is
the
heart
of
this
case.
indeed,
i
draw
some
comfort
from
the
fact
that
the
solicitor
general,
like
the
commission
before
him,
largely
avoids
the
record
and
i
should
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
if
i
may
to
fact
that
the
solicitor
general
has
not
filed
a
reply
brief
or
a
disputed
in
his
oral
argument
in
any
serious
manner,
any
of
the
factual
arguments
that
we
have
made
in
our
brief.
indeed,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
solicitor
general
is
now
forced
to
take
the
extreme
position
that
the
federal
trade
commission
can
decide
this
case
simply
by
[inaudible]
based
on
an
opportunity
or
a
reciprocal
buying
is
itself
an
implied
admission
that
probable
actual
reciprocal
buying
is
not
proved
in
this
record.
i
have
already
said
to
the
court
that
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
solicitor
general's
argument
that
when
there
are
reciprocal
buying
agreements
or
when
there
is
actual
coercive
reciprocity
that
competitors
are
disadvantaged
and
that
there
may
be
a
violation
of
the
law,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
the
probability
of
any
such
coercion
or
agreements
is
proved
anywhere
in
this
record.
the
government
actually
goes
--
mr.
daniel
walker
i
have
shorthanded
that
mr.
justice
goldberg
to
use
the
words
probably,
will
probably,
substantially
lessen
competition
because
that
is
the
interpretation,
the
gloss
that
has
been
placed
on
the
word
may
by
this
court.
the
government
actually
goes
further
then
to
argue
that
a
merger
creating
a
probable
substantiality
of
reciprocal
buying
will
be
bad
under
section
7.
the
solicitor
general
has
argued
that
if
a
merger
creates
the
inducement
to
engage
in
reciprocal
buying,
if
it
creates
the
opportunity
for
reciprocal
buying,
then
the
merger
is
bad.
i
should
like
to
quote
a
sentence
from
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
page
25.
"if
a
merger
changes
the
structure
of
an
industry
in
such
a
manner
as
to
have
the
probability
of
increasing
substantially
the
volume
of
reciprocal
buying
or
enhancing
the
opportunities
for
such
reciprocity,
it
obviously
has
the
required
anti
competitive
effect.”
mr.
daniel
walker
i
am
not
entirely
sure
of
the
answer
to
that
question
mr.
justice
white,
because
i
can't
quite
make
out
the
answer
from
the
government's
arguments.
i
gather
though
that
from
what
the
solicitor
general
said
yesterday
and
today
that
the
government's
position
which
is
a
little
more
extreme
than
has
been
advanced
in
it's
brief
thus
far
is
that
whenever
there
is
a
merger
where
the
opportunity
for
reciprocal
buying
exist
that
merger
is
bad
under
section
7
right
there
and
without
any
more
evidence.
mr.
daniel
walker
i
do
not,
mr.
justice
white
want
to
speak
for
the
solicitor
general
or
purport
to,
but
it's
certainly
taking
the
language
that
he
used,
he
said
you
would
not
have
to
look
at
that,
at
least
that's
the
way
i
heard
it.
mr.
daniel
walker
it
is
not
what
the
federal
trade
commission
held
in
so
many
words.
mr.
daniel
walker
that's
right
mr.
justice
goldberg,
but
under
the
solicitor
general's
theory,
he
assumes
that
foreclosure
will
resolve
simply
from
the
fact
that
the
reciprocity
opportunity
is
created
by
the
merger.
he
says
there
need
to
be
no
inquiry
whatsoever
into
evidence
showing
whether
or
not
actual
reciprocal
buying
will
result
and
foreclosure
will
flow
from
it.
he
says
opportunity
alone
establishes
foreclosure.
may
i
read
this
sentence
again
mr.
justice
goldberg?
“if
a
merger
changes
the
structure
of
an
industry
in
such
a
manner
as
to
have
the
probability
of
increasing
substantially
the
volume
of
reciprocal
buying
or
enhancing
the
opportunities
for
such
reciprocity,
it
obviously
has
the
required
anti
competitive
effect”
and
i
suggest
that
this
equates
probability
with
possibility
on
its
face
and
is
a
clear
perversion
of
the
statutory
test
of
section
7.
now
what
does
reciprocity
opportunity
mean?
all
it
means
is
that
there
are
some
companies
that
could
or
do
sell
to
consolidated
and
could
or
do
buy
from
gentry.
this
sheds
absolutely
no
light
on
whether
reciprocal
buying
will
actually
result.
all
it
shows
is
that
it
might
result.
there
is
a
possibility
of
its
resulting.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
relying
on
opportunity
for
reciprocal
buying
to
prove
effect
is
precisely
the
vice
of
the
federal
trade
commission's
decision
and
this
was
the
reason
why
it
was
overturned
by
the
seventh
circuit.
i
want
to
say
right
now
that
of
course
the
federal
trade
commission
as
the
solicitor
general
has
said,
recited
the
proper
section
7
test,
but
mere
recitation
of
the
proper
test
by
the
commission
does
not
foreclose
this
court
from
examining
the
decision
on
the
record
to
see
whether
they
properly
applied
that
test.
the
question
is
still
whether
on
the
record
as
a
whole,
there
is
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
conclusion.
now
the
solicitor
general
for
the
first
time
in
this
case,
for
the
first
time
relies
on
the
role
of
the
commission
as
an
expert
body.
nobody
has
suggested
that
argument
until
we
were
before
this
court.
the
solicitor
general
said
yesterday
and
i
quote
“that
the
commission
is
entitled
to
draw
on
its
experience
in
concluding
that
creating
an
opportunity
for
reciprocity
carries
a
potential
or
demonstrating
effect.”
and
he
went
on
to
say
and
i
quote
again
“that
the
commission
has
no
obligation
to
introduce
direct
evidence
on
this
point.”
the
case
is
that
the
solicitor
general
has
cited
to
you
this
morning
are
cases
where
it
is
clear
even
from
the
brief
statement
that
he
gave
to
you
where
the
administrative
agency
had
clear
and
actual
experience
with
the
problem
where
this
role
of
expertise
was
adopted.
so,
far
as
i
know
outside
of
three
transportation
industry
cases
in
the
1930s,
the
federal
trade
commission
has
never
had
any
experience
with
reciprocity
and
those
three
cases
i
submit
are
very
unusual
cases.
in
each
of
them,
there
was
coercive
reciprocity
proved.
in
each
of
them,
there
was
a
market
where
the
conditions
were
particularly
conducive
to
reciprocal
dealing
and
i
will
demonstrate
to
you
shortly
that
those
kind
of
conditions
aren't
here.
third,
in
each
one
of
those
cases
there
was
paucity
than
overwhelming
proof
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
reciprocity
of
actually
reciprocal
dealing.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
commission
would
itself
espouse
the
test
that
has
now
been
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general.
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
federal
trade
commission
has
had
much
more
experience
with
horizontal
mergers
than
it
has
had
with
conglomerate
mergers
or
with
reciprocity
creating
mergers.
and
yet,
the
federal
trade
commission
has
never
suggested
that
it
can
rely
on
its
role
as
an
expert
in
solving
even
a
horizontal
merger
case.
i
should
like
to
read
to
you
if
i
may
a
very
brief
quotation
from
the
commission's
decision
in
the
second
proctor
&
gamble
case.
this
opinion
was
written
by
commissioner
elman
and
i
believe
that
he
there
repudiates
in
so
many
words
the
theory
now
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general.
in
every
section
7
proceeding,
the
burden
is
on
the
complainant
to
prove
that
the
merger
will
create
a
reasonable
probability
of
a
substantial
lessening
of
competition.
this
burden
is
not
met
in
any
case
by
invocation
of
a
talismanic
per
se
rule
by
which
to
dispense
with
the
need
or
adducing
evidence
of
probable
anti
competitive
effect.
in
every
case,
the
determination
of
illegality,
if
made,
must
rest
on
specific
facts.
and
i
suggest
that
this
completely
repudiates
the
solicitor
general's
suggestion
that
on
the
point
of
actual
probability
of
reciprocal
buying
the
commission
need
not
introduce
any
direct
evidence.
i
should
like
to
also
mention
to
the
court
that
adoption
of
a
rule
that
would
give
affect
to
the
commission's
role
as
an
expert
in
section
7
cases
would
create
a
tremendous
problem
because
of
the
dual
enforcement
of
section
7.
you
have
federal
district
court
deciding
section
7
cases
and
you
have
the
federal
trade
commission
deciding
them.
the
report
of
the
attorney
general's
committee
on
the
antitrust
law
said,
that
establishing
different
standards
for
application
by
these
two
agencies,
one
agency
in
a
court,
would
create
chaotic
consequences.
i
believe
that
just
thinking
about
it
will
show
you
that
if
you
give
the
commission
one
role
in
section
7
and
the
district
court
another
role,
then
the
courts
of
appeals
and
this
court
are
going
to
have
a
very
difficult
problem
of
review.
finally,
i
suggest
that
at
the
most
any
reliance
on
the
commission's
role
as
an
expert
can
only
create
a
rebuttable
presumption.
surely,
this
cannot
foreclose
the
respondent
from
coming
in
and
proving
that
the
presumption
does
not
apply
and
that
the
assumption
cannot
be
accepted
and
that
is
what
we've
proved
in
this
case.
the
solicitor
general
has
emphasized
in
his
argument,
this
point.
since
at
the
time
of
the
merger,
in
1951,
consolidated
suppliers
were
already
purchasing
from
gentry
approximately
25%
of
the
total
domestic
dehydrated
onion
and
garlic
supply.
the
merger
had
an
immediate
impact
on
that
share
of
the
market.
i
suggest
you
that
this
is
just
a
[inaudible]
reasoning.
it
assumes
that
the
company
that
was
buying
from
gentry
on
the
day
before
the
merger
on
april
1,
1951
for
reasons
of
price,
service
and
quality
is
somehow
on
the
day
after
the
merger
buying
from
gentry
simply
because
consolidated
is
a
customer.
but,
whether
this
kind
of
reciprocal
buying
will
result
is
precisely
the
whole
problem
of
this
case
and
i
do
not
see
how
it
can
be
solved
by
assumption.
there
is
a
major
point
in
this
case
to
which
the
solicitor
general
has
not
addressed
himself
and
i
should
like
to
make
it
by
quoting
from
his
brief.
the
commission's
conclusion
regarding
the
anti
competitive
effective
merger
was
also
supported
by
it's
analysis
of
the
market
structure.
this
showed
that
none
of
gentry's
competitor
was
in
a
in
a
position
to
exert
similar
reciprocity
pressures.
now
this
spotlights
are
very
key
defect
in
the
whole
government's
case.
in
every
reciprocal
buying
situation
there
are
two
markets,
not
just
one.
the
first
market
is
the
market
where
consolidated
buys.
that
market
is
the
thousands
of
food
processors
all
over
the
united
states.
the
second
market
is
the
market
where
if
reciprocal
buying
exists
in
the
first
market,
you
can
have
an
effect
on
competition.
that
second
market
here
is
the
market
consisting
of
producers
of
dehydrated
onion
and
garlic.
the
solicitor
general
like
the
commission
prefers
to
talk
entirely
about
that
second
market
but
as
i
have
said
there
can
be
an
effect
in
the
second
market
only
if
reciprocal
buying
operates
in
the
first
and
neither
the
federal
trade
commission,
nor
the
solicitor
general
anywhere
has
undertaken
an
analysis
of
the
key
market,
the
food
processing
market
to
see
if
it
is
conducive
to
reciprocal
buying.
we
did
and
that's
the
kind
of
evidence
that
goes
to
the
heart
to
this
case.
i
should
like
now
to
address
myself
to
this
problem
of
post
acquisition
evidence.
the
solicitor
general
says
that
the
commission
properly
relegated
this
evidence
to
a
secondary
role
because
it
is
ordinarily
a
questionable
reliability
and
because
heavy
reliance
on
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
prophylactic
test
of
section
7.
but
here
the
threshold
issue,
the
first
issue
is
whether
any
market
power
was
created
by
the
merger
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
post-merger
evidence
is
surely
relevant
on
that
issue
to
see
whether
that
power
does
or
does
not
exist,
really
a
different
question
than
merger
effect.
i
know
of
no
better
way
in
the
case
of
a
completely
untried
and
unknown
power
in
an
industry
such
as
this
to
find
out
whether
it
exists
and
how
effective
it
is
then
to
look
at
the
record
of
what
happened.
the
government
admits
in
its
brief
that
evidence
showing
the
impossibility
of
reciprocal
buying
would
be
relevant
in
a
section
7
case.
surely,
surely
it
must
be
true
that
where
probability
is
the
test,
evidence
showing
the
improbability
of
the
market
power
existing
must
also
be
relevant.
now
it's
is
no
objection
whatsoever
i
believe
to
say
that
post-acquisition
evidence
will
not
be
available
to
the
private
treble
damage
litigants
or
that
frequently
the
government
whne
it
attacks
the
merger
at
the
time
of
consummation
will
not
have
this
evidence.
the
point
is
i
believe
that
the
court
should
use
what
they
have.
if
the
evidence
is
available,
why
put
on
blinders.
where
it's
not
available,
then
surely
a
judgment
must
be
made
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
that
are
available.
it's
very
fundamental
mistake
to
call
all
of
the
evidence
that
consolidated
introduced
in
this
case
as
being
post-acquisition
in
the
sense
that
it
was
somehow
affected
by
the
merger.
there
are
two
types
of
evidence
here.
the
first
type
shows
the
lack
of
actual
reciprocal
buying
and
it's
the
only
kind
of
post-acquisition
evidence
that
the
solicitor
general
has
addressed
himself
to
and
i
want
to
note
here
that
he
says
that
on
this,
he
will
rely
on
the
dupont
case.
i
shall
be
happy
to
join
issue
with
the
solicitor
general
on
the
application
of
the
dupont
case.
if
you
would
had
applied
in
dupont,
the
theory
that
the
solicitor
general
argues
here,
you
would
have
had
to
pay
no
attention
to
seventeen
years
or
whatever
it
was
of
post-acquisition
evidence.
you
could
have
simply
said
because
dupont
owns
ex-percent,
that
it
was
a
very
large
percent
of
the
general
motor
stock,
we
will
assume
that
a
buy-sell
relationship
will
flow
from
the
stock
ownership.
is
when
stock
ownership
a
more
binding
tie
than
this
reciprocal
power
that
we
are
talking
about,
but
the
court
didn't
do
this?
you
looked
at
the
evidence.
you
saw
what
happened
in
the
marketplace.
did
dupont
sell
most
of
the
requirements
of
general
motor's
automotive
finishes
and
fabrics
and
you
found
that
dupont
swept
into
a
commanding
position
as
you
said,
simply
because
of
this
stock
relationship.
and
all
i
ask
for
in
this
case
is
the
kind
of
evidence
that
the
supreme
court
relied
on
in
the
dupont
case.
but
now
i
should
like
to
talk
about
the
second
type
of
evidence
here,
the
type
that
the
solicitor
general
ignores.
this
evidence
deals
with
the
conditions
that
exist
in
the
food
processing
market.
we
put
it
into
the
record
through
the
testimony
by
a
large
number
of
purchasing
agents
and
other
executives
of
food
processing
companies.
now
this
evidence
may
it
please
the
court
is
entirely
unrelated
to
the
merger.
it
could
have
been
testified
to,
in
1951
just
as
well
as
in
1958.
this
kind
of
evidence
i
think
is
very
important.
i
should
like
to
take
a
moment
if
i
may
to
put
this
case
in
a
little
context
with
the
other
section
7
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
this
court.
in
a
progression
of
decisions
ranging
from
brown
shoe
to
philadelphia
national
bank,
this
court
has
reached
the
conclusion
that
a
significant,
horizontal
elimination
of
competition
may
create
a
rebuttable
presumption
of
merger
illegality,
and
you
have
shown
what
i
believe
to
be
an
understandable
impatience,
with
the
details
of
market
behavior
evidence
in
that
kind
of
a
case.
you've
been
looking
obviously
for
clear
cut
test,
guidelines
that
can
help
the
businessmen,
the
bar
and
the
enforcement
agencies.
now
you
have
before
you
the
first
so
called
conglomerate
merger
case.
i
do
not
wish
to
waste
your
time
trying
to
define
a
conglomerate
merger.
for
convenience,
i
use
it
to
mean
only
that
it
is
not
in
the
traditional,
horizontal
or
vertical
pattern.
the
only
significance
of
this
being
a
conglomerate
merger
in
my
opinion
is
that
the
test
you
have
fashioned
for
automatic
effect
cases
simply
cannot
be
applied
here.
there
is
no
automatic
foreclosure
effect
from
this
kind
of
a
merger
as
there
is
for
a
horizontal
merger
or
a
vertical
merger.
now
the
commentators
and
i
too,
find
it
very
strange
that
the
federal
trade
commission
is
seeking
to
fashion
a
much
more
severe
rule
for
these
conglomerate
mergers
than
you
and
it
had
done
for
horizontal
and
vertical
mergers
where
the
effects
are
much,
much
clear.
two
very
well
known
economists,
well
known
to
this
court,
kaysen
and
turner,
writing
in
1959
have
proved
to
be
remarkably
prophetic
about
the
test
that
should
be
fashioned
for
section
7
cases.
they
advocated
these
severe
tests,
would
have
been
called
severe,
that
you
have
largely
adopted.
when
kaysen
and
turner
reached
conglomerate
mergers,
they
threw
up
their
hands.
they
said
the
standards
of
illegality
seemed
to
be
wholly
illusive.
indeed,
kaysen
and
turner
writing
in
1959
said
that
they
would
go
so
far
as
to
permit
conglomerate
acquisitions
by
everyone.
now
the
government
in
its
brief,
but
not
the
solicitor
general
in
his
oral
argument
does
come
to
grips
with
the
problem
in
this
case,
and
suggests
a
test
for
determining
whether
reciprocal
buying
will
probably
exist.
at
page
28
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
it
is
said
that
there
must
be
an
examination
into
the
extent
of
the
acquiring
company's
buying
power,
and
that
this
determines
the
effectiveness
of
the
alleged
leverage,
which
can
be
used
to
induce
reciprocal
buying.
now
with
this
i
agree,
but
the
court
will
look
in
vain
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
will
listen
in
vain
to
his
argument,
and
will
look
in
vain
in
the
commission's
decision
for
any
analysis
whatsoever
of
the
extent
of
consolidated's
buying
power
among
the
nation's
thousands
of
food
processors.
that
buying
power
can
be
tested
in
this
record
and
it
requires
the
examination
of
those
conditions
that
i
talked
about
a
moment
ago,
what
are
they?
to
what
extent
do
price,
service
and
quality
control
purchasing
decisions?
to
the
extent
that
price,
service
and
quality
control
obviously
reciprocity
affect
is
going
to
be
diluted
and
i
note
that
yesterday
the
solicitor
general
made
another
significant
omission,
not
contained
in
this
brief.
he
admitted
that
he
is
not
arguing
that
consolidated's
buying
power
is
so
strong
that
it
enables
sales
to
be
made
without
regard
to
price,
service
and
quality.
there
should
be
a
inquiry
as
to
whether
there
are
other
controlling
factors,
here
they
are.
purchasing
agents
in
this
industry
aren't
free
to
just
decide
what
they
want
to
buy.
they
have
laboratories,
quality
control
departments,
production
departments,
all
looking
over
their
shoulders
at
every
single
decision,
and
you
will
see
in
the
record
that
many
of
these
purchasing
agents
said
that
their
decisions
were
dictated
by
factors
such
as
this.
a
third
condition;
do
the
food
processors
need
consolidated
more
than
consolidated
needs
the
food
processors?
to
the
extent
that,
that
food
processors
knows
the
consolidated
has
to
carry
his
product.
for
example,
nationally
advertised
product
like,
campbell
soup,
he
is
not
going
to
be
responsive
to
any
threat
to
withhold
buying,
because
he
knows
it's
an
empty
threat.
now
i
am
not
going
to
say
to
the
court
that
any
one
of
these
conditions
will
make
reciprocal
buying
impossible.
i
am
going
to
say
to
you
that
all
of
them
taken
together
inhibit,
dilute
and
hold
on
any
existence
of
reciprocal
buying,
where
the
issue
is
one
probability
all
of
these
conditions
are
relevant.
the
solicitor
general
yesterday
said,
what
i
thought
was
a
very
amazing
thing.
he
said
that
this
buying
power
advantage
maybe
big
or
small.
he
conceded
that
it's
a
fact,
its
existence
may
vary
from
industry
to
industry,
and
then
he
said
and
i
quote,
“whether
it's
big
or
small
is
irrelevant.”
i
seriously
disagree
with
this.
if
the
buying
power
is
small,
how
in
the
world
can
you
reach
the
conclusion
that
there
will
probably
be
a
substantial
effect
from
the
buying
power?
there
must
be
an
inquiry
to
see
and
the
government
says,
so
it
is
brief,
although
the
solicitor
general
did
not
in
oral
argument
that
the
extent
of
the
buying
power
is
all
important.
mr.
daniel
walker
no
question
about
it,
mr.
justice
white,
absolutely
---
mr.
daniel
walker
absolutely
sir,
because
you
have
an
automatic
elimination
of
competition.
mr.
daniel
walker
that's
a
fair
statement
of
your
decision
sir.
mr.
daniel
walker
if
this
court
can
conclude
from
this
record
that
gentry
can
add
in
the
foreseeable
future
or
any
time
5%
to
its
market
share
through
the
use
of
reciprocal
buying.
mr.
daniel
walker
no,
i
am
trying
to
say
mr.
justice
white
answering
what
i
thought
to
be
your
question
that
if
as
a
result
of
the
merger,
and
the
reciprocal
buying
allegedly
created
by
the
merger,
gentry
were
to
be
able
to
pick
up
5%
of
the
market
through
reciprocal
buying,
than
you
might
very
well
have
to
apply
the
rationale
of
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case.
but
my
whole
point
here
is,
that
i
challenge
anyone
to
find
anywhere
in
this
record
evidence
that
gentry
will
pick
up
1%,
let
alone
5%
from
the
existence
of
reciprocal
buying.
there
are
two
types
of
reciprocity
that
are
alleged
in
case,
and
i
think
this
is
a
very
key
point,
again
a
point
that
is
submerged
by
the
solicitor
general
in
his
oral
argument.
the
first
is
overt.
it
depends
on
attempts
on
an
express
waving
of
the
power,
if
you
will.
the
second
type
is
silent
reciprocity.
the
government
calls
it
tacit
accommodative
reciprocity.
overt
depends
on
action
or
silent
reciprocity
to
operate
according
to
the
government,
absolutely
nothing
need
to
be
done.
it's
there
all
the
time
from
the
day
this
merger
occurred
in
april
1951;
this
supposedly
awesome
silent
reciprocity
force
has
been
operating
every
single
day
on
food
processors.
neither
of
these
kinds
of
reciprocity
can
be
said
to
be
untried
among
food
processors.
i
have
pointed
out
that
silent
has
been
there
since
1951,
if
it
exists.
the
solicitor
general
accurately
points
out
that
consolidated
executives
did
believe
in
reciprocity
in
the
year
shortly
after
the
merger.
i
am
sure
they
did,
but
they
learned
the
hard
way
just
like
we
have
proved
in
this
record
that
it
simply
won't
work,
and
they
were
convinced
also
by
the
evidence.
the
belief
of
these
executives
in
1952-1953
stands
on
no
better
ground
than
the
present
day
speculation
or
belief
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
both
of
them
are
proved
to
be
an
erroneous
assumption
in
this
record.
mr.
daniel
walker
yes
sir!
mr.
daniel
walker
that's
absolutely
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
think
that's
a
very
key
point
because
those
conditions
nobody
can
knockout
of
this
record
on
the
basis
that
its
post-acquisition
evidence
suspect
because
it
came
into
the
record
after
the
merger.
because
both
of
these
alleged
powers
have
been
tried,
because
consolidated
didn't
see
that
sword
as
the
government
says,
of
overt
reciprocity,
and
wave
into
the
food
processors
because
this
silent
reciprocity
has
been
there
everyday,
it's
entirely
appropriate
i
suggest
to
look
and
see
what
actually
happened.
commission's
trial
counsel
did
try
to
do
this.
first,
they
relied
on
increased
gentry
sales
to
consolidated's
suppliers,
indeed
you
heard
the
solicitor
general
rely
on
that
this
morning.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
this
is
guilt
by
association
with
a
vengeance.
commencing
in
1951,
there
was
a
dramatic
upsurge
in
the
usage
of
dehydrated
onion
and
garlic
in
the
united
states.
housewives
started
buying
like
mad
these
new
convenience
foods,
the
barbeque,
sauces,
the
dried
soups,
the
salad
dressings,
the
italian
foods,
the
mexican
foods,
and
all
of
these
required
lots
of
dehydrated
onion
and
garlic.
mr.
daniel
walker
1951.
it's
a
dramatic
coincidence
mr.
chief
justice
that
this
upsurge,
commencement
of
it
coincided
at
almost
the
same
year
that
this
merger
took
place.
mr.
daniel
walker
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
interesting.
i
inquired
as
to
why
gerber
used
dehydrated
onion
and
i
found
that
the
reason
is
not
for
the
babies,
but
for
the
mothers
because
gerber
found
that
the
mothers
were
testing
the
baby
food
before
they
give
it
to
the
baby.[laughter]
then
they
would
buy
the
kind
of
baby
food
that
they
like
the
taste
of
best,
so
gerber
put
onion
in
there.[laughter]
during
the
same
period
as
the
solicitor
general
has
mentioned
and
which
we
surely
concede
that
is
from
51-58,
consolidated's
retail
and
wholesale
business
has
expanded.
it
has
during
this
period,
bought
more
food
products
from
more
food
processors.
you
could
choose
almost
any
food
processor
of
consequence
in
the
united
states
and
you
would
find
that
during
this
period
of
years,
it
sold
more
to
consolidated
and
bought
more
dehydrated
onion
and
garlic.
i
suggest
you
that
precisely
the
same
thing
would
have
happened,
these
figures
of
the
solicitor
general
relies
on,
if
there
had
been
no
merger
in
this
case.
this
doesn't
prove
the
bang
of
our
probability
of
reciprocity.
all
it
proves
again
is
opportunity
that
is
that
there
are
food
processors
who,
if
they
are
going
to
engage
in
reciprocal
buying
can
buy
from
gentry
because
consolidated
is
a
customer,
but
whether
they
will
or
not,
you
can't
get
out
of
this
record.
now
consolidated
met
the
commission's
case
here
head-on.
the
government
introduced
evidence.
they
took
up
the
cudgel
on
70
companies
in
an
effort
to
show
that
reciprocity
worked.
consolidated
and
they
introduced
this
evidence
by
the
way
just
by
throwing
in
documents,
showing
hearsay
and
circumstantial
evidence
with
respect
to
reciprocity
context
and
reciprocity
working.
we
called
witnesses
from
50
companies.
the
commission
had
not
called
one
witness
to
testify
that
reciprocal
buying
existed.
we
called
witnesses
from
51
companies.
this
included
all
of
the
important
customers
among
the
government
70.
these
companies
that
we
had
witnesses
from
bought
more
than
1/3rd
of
gentry's
dehydrated
onion
and
garlic
in
1958.
these
are
the
witnesses
who
denied
that
they
engaged
in
reciprocal
buying
and
more
importantly
went
on
and
testified
in
detail
to
the
conditions
controlling
their
purchasing
decisions
that
would
prevent
reciprocal
buying
in
the
future.
i
won't
distress
to
the
court
lest
somebody
suggest
it,
that
this
evidence
is
not
at
all
lied.
the
witnesses
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case
who
testified
to
lack
of
merger
effect
on
their
businesses.
the
court
said
that
this
evidence
was
--
that
this
question
was
too
complex
or
lay
testimony,
and
besides
the
witnesses
didn't
give
any
concrete
reasons.
neither
of
those
reasons
applies
here.
these
witnesses
were
the
only
ones
who
knew
the
facts.
they
were
the
men
who
actually
did
buying
all
of
it
of
dehydrated
onion
and
garlic
from
1951
to
1958.
nobody
else
would
know
they
had
it
in
their
heads,
and
these
men
knew
the
reasons
and
gave
the
reasons.
now
i
want
to
say
this
quickly
to
the
court,
reciprocity
will
get
a
few
sales,
no
question
about
it.
i
want
to
remind
you
though
something
that
the
solicitor
general
didn't
mention,
when
he
referred
to
the
examples
of
reciprocity
effectiveness
in
these
records.
do
you
know
how
many
they
were?
he
said,
that
on
a
number
of
occasions,
reciprocity
succeeded
according
to
the
evidence.
there
were
three
instances,
three.
and
each
of
those
three
examples
was
brought
out
on
direct
evidence
by
counsel
for
consolidated
foods
corporation.
this
was
a
part
of
our
trial
case,
call
as
many
as
possible
of
these
people
involved
in
the
government's
case,
and
see
on
a
fair
open
basis
where
reciprocity
worked
and
where
it
didn't.
three
admitted
it
when
i
examined
them
and
brought
it
out
on
direct
examination,
48
denied
it.
now
what
in
the
world
can
be
the
logical
basis
for
accepting
this
evidence
as
to
three
companies,
and
rejecting
it
as
to
48?
the
unbridged
gap
in
the
government's
case
from
the
time
it
started
right
up
to
this
court
is
the
reliance
on
conjecture
rather
than
proof
to
support
this
conclusion
that
there
were
probably
be
substantial
reciprocal
buying.
mr.
daniel
walker
yes
mr.
justice
douglas,
in
this
sense
there
is
the
evidence
showing
that
because
wholesale
business
was
declining
in
the
united
states,
consolidated
wished
to
diversify.
it
acquired
a
number
of
processing
units
and
later
some
retail
units
and
the
acquisition
of
gentry
was
in
this
pattern
of
diversifying
out
of
wholesale
and
into
processing.
the
evidence
shows
directly
although
you
haven't
asked
the
question
sir
though,
that
reciprocity
was
never
thought
of
in
connection
with
this
merger.
no
executive
and
there
was
flat
testimony
on
this,
it
never
occurred
to
anyone
that
reciprocal
buying
can
exist
here
before
the
merger
took
place.
mr.
daniel
walker
yes
sir,
we
surely
can
supply
them.
mr.
daniel
walker
yes
sir,
i
have
only
added
the
additional
evidence
that
reciprocity
was
not
a
factor
at
all
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
walker
i
believe
so
but
i
ma
not
sure
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
daniel
walker
i
shall
like
to
spend
the
moment,
if
i
may,
on
the
statistical
evidence
in
this
case
that
we
rely
on
and
if
i
may,
in
this
connection,
i
should
like
to
ask
the
court
if
you
will
to
turn
to
the
chart
on
page
7
of
our
brief,
because
i
believe
this
to
be
one
the
most
dramatic
pieces
of
evidence
in
this
case.
it
is
the
blue
brief
on
page
7.
mr.
daniel
walker
yes
sir,
the
main
brief
and
i
perhaps
at
this
moment
should
divert
to
say
that
we
filed
two
volumes
to
the
brief,
the
second
volume
is
called
the
reciprocity
supplement
and
this
is
a
very
important
document.
i
urge
to
the
court
not
to
overlook
it
because
you
will
find
there
in
detail
these
conditions
that
i
talked
about
that
are
the
heart
of
this
case.
now
looking
at
the
chart,
the
red
bar
on
the
left
shows
that
in
1957
gentry's
overall
market
share,
it
share
of
onion
sales
to
all
companies
was
38%.
now
i
shall
like
to
take
the
other
companies,
and
the
solicitor
general
mentioned
this
briefly,
but
he
didn't
tell
you
where
these
companies
came
from.
these
are
the
groups
of
the
companies
that
were
selected
at
each
of
the
various
stages
of
this
case
by
the
government
in
an
effort
to
show
that
reciprocity
worked.
they
chose
the
companies.
the
ones
that
are
being
relied
on
by
the
solicitor
general
before
this
court
are
the
eight
companies.
there
gentry
sold
33%
as
opposed
to
its
market
share
of
38%.
before
the
seventh
circuit,
counsel
for
the
commission
picked
out
17.
thereby
1957,
gentry
sold
32%
as
compared
to
its
market
share
of
38%
and
with
the
hearing
examiner's
nine
companies,
the
figure
was
23%.
but
take
all
of
the
70
companies,
every
one
of
the
companies
selected
by
the
government
at
the
outset
of
this
case
to
prove
reciprocity
effectiveness
and
if
you
take
sales
to
all
70,
gentry's
percentage
was
32%
as
opposed
to
its
market
share
of
38%
and
this
after
6
full
years
of
overt
reciprocity
with
each
one
of
these
companies
and
after
6
full
years
of
this
alleged
silent
reciprocity.
mr.
daniel
walker
no,
because
that
data
is
not
possible
to
obtain
from
the
evidence
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
daniel
walker
i
think,
it
very
probably
is
true
because
of
the
industry
growth.
mr.
daniel
walker
well,
it
proves,
if
i
may
mr.
justice
white,
that
if
reciprocity
were
effecting,
than
if
it
were
operating
in
this
industry,
gentry
ought
to
do
better
and
the
solicitor
general
has
argued
that
it
has
done
better
when
the
consolidated
supplier
is
subjected
to
reciprocity
than
it
does
with
all
of
its
companies.
mr.
daniel
walker
yeah.
mr.
daniel
walker
on
an
absolute
basis
do
you
mean
mr.
justice
white
or
on
a
percentage
basis?
mr.
daniel
walker
it
surely,
it
surely
would
look
different.
mr.
daniel
walker
no,
we
do
not
sir,
but
what
we
do
know
is
--
mr.
daniel
walker
i
think
it
is
very
effective
in
demonstrating
that
after
seven
years
or
six
full
years
mr.
justine
white,
it
shows
that
gentry
didn't
do
any
better
with
the
companies
subjected
to
reciprocity
than
it
did
with
companies
with
all
of
its
customers
and
i
think
it
is
some
evidence,
i
quickly
agree
with
you
even
if
it
is
not
conclusive
evidence.
now,
i
should
like
to
spend
a
moment
on
the
market
share
evidence,
and
first
i
want
to
make
it
abundantly
clear
to
the
court,
that
i
do
not
argue
that
post-merger
decline
in
market
shares
proves
that
the
merger
did
not
affect
competition.
that's
not
my
argument.
what
i
do
say
to
you
is
that
this
evidence
corroborates
the
other
evidence
we
just
looked
at
and
all
of
the
other
evidence
in
this
record
showing
that
reciprocity
is
not
affective.
as
mr.
justice
white
so
properly
pointed
out,
you
cannot
pick
up
one
bit
of
evidence
in
this
case
and
say
it's
conclusive,
but
if
you
put
all
of
it
together,
i
think
you
have
a
very
persuasive
case
at
least
overcoming
whatever
you
want
to
choose
to
call
the
commission's
presumption
or
assumption
or
conjuncture.
now,
with
the
market
share
data,
if
the
court
wishes
to
look
at
it,
the
chart
appears
on
page
29
of
our
brief,
and
you
will
see
from
this
chart
that
basic
was
the
dominant
onion
producer
in
1951
and
it's
still
the
dominant
onion
producer.
i
should
like
to
mention
in
this
connection
that
the
solicitor
general
overstated
the
case
when
he
said
that
gentry
was
the
dominant
producer.
it
has
never
been
the
dominant
producer
in
this
market.
basic
has
always
been
the
dominant
producer.
gentry's
increased
market
share
came
as
the
court
will
see,
in
onion,
only
after
1955,
and
that
coincided
with
the
time
when
it
installed
its
new
metal
dehydration
equipment
that
solved
the
wood
splinter
problem
and
gave
it
a
quality
edge
over
its
competitors.
now,
this
is
not
speculation.
the
evidence
would
show
that
with
just
three
companies,
lipton,
beech-nut
and
snow,
gentry
sold
over
one
million
more
pounds
in
1957
than
it
did
in
1954
to
these
three
companies
for
this
very
reason;
that
is
elimination
of
the
wood
splinters.
that
one
million
pounds
alone
accounts
for,
i
believe
about
24%
of
gentry's
total
sales
in
1954
and
about
7%
of
total
industry
production.
in
garlic,
you
see
that
the
picture
went
the
other
way.
gentry
went
down
by
12%
from
51%
to
39%.
now,
the
solicitor
general
relies
on
this
when
he
says
that
gentry
perhaps
had
inferior
garlic
quality.
well,
i
want
to
ask
this
question,
if
this
reciprocal
buying
was
operating
so
powerfully
in
this
market,
why
didn't
it
enable
the
garlic
share
to
stay
even
if
gentry
did
have
inferior
quality?
i
submit
to
you
that
again,
not
conclusive,
not
controlling,
but
the
cross-trends
of
these
market
shares,
onion
up,
garlic
down
is
some
very
persuasive
evidence
that
ordinary
competitive
conditions
were
operating
in
this
market.
i
should
like
to
mention
again
the
fact
that
according
to
the
government's
arguments,
since
the
day
in
1951
when
this
merger
took
place,
this
supposedly
awesome
silent
reciprocity
power
has
been
operating.
food
processors
are
supposed
to
automatically
buy
from
their
customer
simply
because
they
know
which
side
of
the
bread
the
butter
is
on.
well,
there
are
thousands
of
food
processors
in
the
united
states,
and
if
this
power
were
as
effective
as
the
government
says
it
is,
you
would
think,
i
would
think
that
they
would
have
been
literally
knocking
down
gentry's
door
to
get
out
at
its
dehydrated
onion
and
garlic
and
buy
it
in
order
to
please
consolidated.
and
whatever
else
the
statistical
evidence
shows;
it
surely
proves
that
food
processors
in
the
united
states
were
not
beating
down
gentry's
door
to
get
their
product.
mr.
daniel
walker
i
am
not
making
that
argument
mr.
justice
white.
i
am
saying
because
--
mr.
daniel
walker
i
don't
have
very
--
well,
first
you're
assuming
mr.
justice
white
that
there
is
a
power
there
to
use
and
i
do
not
accept
the
assumption
that
there
is
a
power.
i
am
saying
to
you
that
that
the
power
--
mr.
daniel
walker
well,
i
wanted
to
quickly
go
on
and
make
it
clear
that
by
saying
that
i
wasn't
accepting
any
assumption
that
there
was
a
power
there
that
was
on
exercise.
mr.
daniel
walker
well,
i
suppose
this
depends
on
how
you
assess
the
power.
may
i
answer
it
this
way
mr.
justice
white?
that
if
by
power
you
mean
consolidated's
ability
to
go
to
customers
and
say
look,
you
buy
onion
and
garlic
from
gentry
because
we
buy
from
you,
then
yes,
they
used
what
they
had,
and
the
evidence
proves
that
it
didn't
work.
mr.
daniel
walker
it
definitely
did
not
mr.
justice
white.
there
were
almost
–
mr.
daniel
walker
there
were
almost
200
documents
introduced
and
evidenced
by
the
government
showing
that
with
almost
100
food
processors
consolidated
did
use
it.
it
used
all
kinds.
take
grocery
store
products.
mr.
daniel
walker
it
never
denied
that
it
tried
to
use
this
reciprocity
dealing
suggestion
with
its
customers.
mr.
daniel
walker
and
learned
the
hard
way
that
it
wouldn't
work,
yes
sir.
mr.
daniel
walker
that's
right
mr.
justice
goldberg.
as
i
said
in
the
seventh
circuit,
i
am
glad
that
this
evidence
is
in
the
record
because
it
enables
us
to
show
that
although
tried,
it
didn't
work.
mr.
daniel
walker
well,
i
would
still
have
the
argument
mr.
justice
white,
which
i
believe,
it
remains
there
no
matter
what
door
you
go
out
on
this
point,
and
that
is
that
assuming
it
is
there,
in
the
absence
of
some
evidence
by
the
government
that
has
the
burden
to
proof
is
not
consistent
with
section
7,
but
here
it
was
tried.
mr.
daniel
walker
i
do
not
--
mr.
daniel
walker
but
mr.
justice
douglas,
they
couldn't
do
any
more
tomorrow
a
new
management
and
the
existing
management
tried
to
do.
it
isn't
the
potential
power.
mr.
daniel
walker
well,
[attempt
to
laughter]
we
do
know
this.
we
know
it
was
tried
and
we
know
it
didn't
work.
what
reason
is
there
to
suspect
mr.
justice
douglas,
that
among
food
processors
--
mr.
daniel
walker
precisely.
mr.
daniel
walker
well,
if
i
may
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
second
laying
of
the
government's
argument
is
this
so
called
silent
reciprocity.
this
doesn't
depend
on
management
doing
anything
or
being
afraid
of
antitrust
consequences.
according
to
the
government,
they're
supposed
to
automatically
buy
from
a
customer.
did
they?
they
did
not
and
i
think
that
seven
years
of
evidence
showing
not
only
they
did
not
mr.
justice
douglas,
but
please
more
importantly,
that
there
are
conditions
existing
among
food
processors
that
will
keep
it
from
operating
it
in
the
future.
i
am
not
saying
to
you
that
you've
got
to
decide
the
section
7
test
case
on
the
basis
on
the
past.
i
am
saying
that
if
you
look
at
the
market
structure
evidence
in
this
case,
the
real
market,
you
will
find
structural
things
existing
that
will
prevent
reciprocity
from
being
effective
in
the
future,
no
matter
what
consolidated's
management
decides
to
do.
this
is
my
argument.
now,
i
quickly
say
to
you
mr.
justice
douglas,
going
on
a
little
further
on
this
very
point.
mr.
daniel
walker
i
do
not
see
that
it
would
be
under
section
7
since
you
said
in
dupont
that
at
any
time
that
a
market
threatens
to
have
the
anti
competitive
effects
--
mr.
daniel
walker
the
government
can
attack
it.
so
there
can
be
no
res
judicata,
no
statute
of
limitation.
now,
a
skeptic
may
argue
that
this
evidence
that
i've
been
talking
to
you
about
is
not
conclusive.
perhaps
it
is
not,
but
surely
it
should
cause
this.
it
should
cause
the
trier
of
fact
to
reexamine
his
premise.
it
should
cause
him
to
look
back
over
his
shoulder,
and
see
whether
that
assumption
that
reciprocal
buying
will
always
inevitably
result
from
a
merger
of
creating
the
opportunity
may
not
be
true.
at
the
very
least,
it
should
cause
a
closer,
harder
look
at
the
structure
of
the
key
market,
not
onion
and
garlic
producing,
but
the
thousands
of
food
processors.
i
should
like
to
take
one
more
example
that
i
believe
to
be
a
very
dramatic
one.
the
court
is
aware
of
the
fact
as
i
have
mentioned
before
that
there
is
this
factor
of
consumer
demand
that
requires
companies
like
consolidated
to
carry
these
products
whether
they
want
to
or
not.
i
should
like
to
take
three
of
these;
hormel,
the
birds
eye
division
of
general
foods,
and
oscar
mayer.
i
am
sure
you
are
all
familiar
with
their
products.
by
1958,
consolidated
bought
$764,000
worth
of
birds
eye
products.
it
bought
$500,000
worth
of
oscar
mayer's
products
and
it
bought
$320,000
worth
from
hormel,
and
yet
from
1951
to
1958
despite
these
very
large
purchases
by
consolidated,
gentry
has
been
spectacularly
unsuccessful
in
selling
to
these
companies.
in
this
total
span
of
years,
it
sold
30,000
pounds
of
dehydrated
onion
and
garlic
during
a
period
of
time
when
its
competitors
sold
over
800,000
pounds
of
dehydrated
onion
and
garlic.
now
the
government
argues
that
existing
gentry
customers
well
be
locked
in
by
this
merger.
that
is
if
the
company
buying
from
gentry
in
1951
is
going
to
be
locked
to
gentry,
because
consolidated
is
a
customer,
but
let's
just
look
at
some
examples,
what
is
the
proof
of
the
pudding.
birds
eye
and
armour
where
consolidated
from
armour
bought
one
million
dollars
worth
of
their
products.
they
were
gentry
customers
in
1951,
and
yet
both
of
these
companies
absolutely
stopped
buying
from
gentry
after
1951.
if
a
large
meat
packer
such
as
swift
should
buy
a
meat
market,
this
court
knows
that
the
competitors
of
swift
are
going
to
be
foreclosed
from
selling
to
that
meat
market.
if
the
meat
market
enters
into
a
long-term
requirements
contract
with
swift,
you
know
that
swift's
competitors
can't
sell
to
that
meat
market
during
the
duration
of
the
contract,
and
the
same
is
true
with
tying
agreements.
if
you
have
to
buy
a
to
get
b,
then
you
know
that
the
competing
sellers
of
a
are
going
to
be
foreclosed
for
making
that
sale.
to
use
judge
yankwitcher's
very
colorful
language
in
a
different
context,
all
of
these
three
vertical
devices
that
i
have
mentioned
build
market
foreclosure
fences
that
are
bull
strong,
horse
high
and
hog
tight.
not
so,
i
suggest
to
this
court
with
reciprocal
buying.
it's
hard
even
to
tell
whether
it
exists
in
the
first
place.
it's
duration
is
surely
not
fixed
and
its
market
foreclosure
effect
is
hard
to
measure,
and
this
is
all
the
more
reason
i
suggest
to
take
a
harder
look
at
the
market
to
see
whether
these
foreclosure
effects
will
probably
exist.
it
ran
on
over
a
course
of
a
couple
of
years
mr.
justice
harlan,
because
hearings
were
held
in
different
cities
over
different
periods
of
time,
no
depositions,
all
of
the
hearings
with
a
before
the
hearing
examiner
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
now
if
this
court
should
choose
to
assume
that
reciprocity
is
practiced
in
human
relations
and
because
it
does,
and
because
it
may
exist
in
some
other
industries,
it
will
be
prevalent
and
effective
here,
then
as
i
have
said
before,
there
is
precious
little
left
for
consolidated
to
say.
but
if
this
court
recognizes
that
outside
this
record,
there
is
a
complete
absence
of
empirical
evidence
anywhere
about
the
sales
inducing
power
of
consolidated
among
food
processors
then
we
have
much
to
say.
now
i
ask
this
court
for
no
sweeping
rule
that
would
bless
conglomerate
mergers
generally
or
reciprocity
creating
mergers.
there
will
be
time
enough
to
consider
such
rules
and
principles
when
a
proper
case
comes
to
this
court
where
effective
reciprocity
or
its
probability
of
existence
in
the
future
is
proved.
there
will
be
time
enough
for
you
to
consider
whether
reciprocity
can
violate
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
or
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
when
such
a
case
comes
before
this
court.
what
we
do
ask
in
the
words
of
mr.
justice
brandeis,
is
that
there
be
here
a
factual
showing
of
illegality.
we
ask
only
that
this
determination
of
legality
or
illegality
be
made
on
the
record
in
this
case,
and
that
the
test
applied,
the
probability
of
substantial
effect,
not
possibility
of
some
effect.
if
the
court
will
pardon
my
presumptuousness,
i
am
confident
that
if
you
apply
the
probability
of
substantial
effect
test
rather
than
possibility
of
some
affect
as
i
believe
the
commission
did,
you'll
conclude
that
the
seventh
circuit
properly
overturned
the
decision
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
mr.
daniel
walker
i
wanted
to
tender
an
answer
to
the
question
the
record
places
where
this
evidence
appears
with
respect
to
the
reasons
for
acquiring
gentry,
that
is
in
the
record
141-148
which
establishes
that
reciprocity
was
not
considered
in
connection
with
the
advisability
of
the
merger,
and
at
1709-1710,
on
the
reasons
for
consolidated's
diversification
out
of
wholesale
[inaudible]
mr.
daniel
walker
it
was
an
asset
acquisition
mr.
justice
white.
by
the
way,
the
reason
why
this
merger
wasn't
attacked
for
so
long
i
suggest
is
because
this
investigation
started
out
under
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
in
1954,
and
it
wasn't
until
after
the
dupont
decision
in
1957
that
the
federal
trade
commission
decided
to
turn
this
into
a
section
7
case,
and
that's
the
reason
for
this
delay
that
mr.
deck
was
asked
about.
mr.
daniel
walker
i
believe
they
are,
[inaudible]
yes,
sir.
