mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
place
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
trade
commission
case,
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
which
involves
the
validity
of
a
corporate
acquisition
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
consolidated
food,
the
respondent,
acquired
all
the
assets
of
gentry
incorporated.
the
federal
trade
commission,
after
the
usual
proceedings,
ordered
divestiture
and
its
order
was
set
aside
and
we
brought
the
case
here.
the
case
is
novel
because
it
brings
before
the
court,
for
the
first
time,
not
a
horizontal
merger,
but
a
kind
of
vertical
merger
that
weâ€™ve
often
dealt
with,
but
one
where
the
substantial
threat
to
competition
is
in
the
creation
of
opportunities
and
a
power
of
reciprocal
purchasing,
a
practice
destructively
think
fair
competition
which
is
being
more
and
more
widely
used
as
a
result
of
conglomerate
mergers
and
which
has
become
more
and
more
disturbing
to
economist.
in
this
case,
we
are
concerned
with
a
market
for
food
seasoning,
dehydrated
garlic
and
dehydrated
onions,
a
rapidly
growing
industry
that
buys
many
large
processors
of
food.
gentry
incorporated
was
one
of
the
two
dominant
firms
in
that
industry.
in
1950,
immediately
prior
to
the
acquisition
by
consolidated,
its
sales
accounted
for
28
percent
of
only
onion
sold
and
to
51
percent
of
all
the
garlic
sold.
with
its
principal
competitor,
basic,
the
two
had
upwards
of
80
percent
of
the
entire
market
and
the
rest
was
divided
amongst
smaller
firms.
consolidated
foods
corporation
which
bought
up
gentry,
is
a
large
diversified
food
company,
chiefly
engaged
in
distributing
food
to
wholesalers,
chain
stores,
other
supermarkets
and
other
outlets.
in
1950-51,
its
assets
were
60
million
and
its
sales
were
174
million
dollars.
by
1956,
its
assets
were
99
million
dollars
and
its
net
sales
were
more
than
268
million
dollars.
the
50
or
60
percent
increase
came
about
very
largely
as
a
result
of
a
series
of
corporate
acquisitions.
in
the
period
1950
to
1958,
consolidated
bought
up
21
other
concerns.
the
merger
in
1951,
by
which
consolidated
acquired
the
assets
of
gentry
in
exchange
for
common
stock,
combined
two
things
in
consolidated's
hands.
one,
it
gave
consolidated
gentry's
already
large
shares
of
these
markets
for
onion
and
garlic.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
this
is,
but
i
didn't
say
onion
and
garlic,
this
is
dehydrated
onion
and
garlic.
mr.
archibald
cox
sold
the
food
processes
like
gaber's
food,
armor
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
they
are
also
used
for
super
sale,
but
not
direct
--
mr.
archibald
cox
consolidated
also
did
some
food
processing
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it
owns
a
few
retail
outlets,
but
it's
essentially
in
the
--
it's
role
as
a
distributor
that
were
concerned,
we're
not
suggesting
that
there
was
any
direct
competition
between
it
and
gentry.
so
that
its
food
processing
doesn't
matter
in
that
respect,
and
we're
not
relying
either
mr.
justice
brennan
on
the
suggestion
that
in
its
role
as
processor,
it
was
buying
from
gentry
and
by
putting
the
two
together,
was
able
to
preempt
part
of
the
market
in
that
way.
the
important
point
here
and
it
comes
to
what
mr.
justice
stewart
said
about
this
not
being
consumer
goods,
is
that
when
you
put
together,
in
one
set
of
hands,
gentry's
already
a
large
share
of
this
month,
29%
and
51%,
plus
consolidated
purchasing
power,
then
we
say
the
combination
carried
a
sufficiently
probable
threat
to
competition
and
the
reason
was
this,
that
the
sales
of
onion
were
made
to
food
processors,
they
put
in
it
an
ingredient,
and
those
food
processors
were
the
very
people
in
large
part
from
whom
consolidated
would
do
its
buying
and
the
problem
in
our
view
is
that
this
interjected
into
competition
in
selling
onions
and
garlic
an
improper
force,
the
opportunities
to
encourage
or
enforce
reciprocal
buying
and
thus
gave
consolidated
by
merging,
an
improper
advantage
over
the
other
sellers
of
onion
and
garlic
which
carried
such
great
threat
to
competition
as
to
be
unlawful
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
it's
between
the
retail
stores
and
the
process
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
sells
to
retail
stores.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
has
--
yes,
that's
it's
primary
business.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
buys
from
gurbert
foods,
for
example,
and
then
sells
to
piggly
wiggly.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
also
put
itself
in
a
position
where
it
was
able
to
sell
a
garbage
foods
or
have
garbage
foods,
drugs
on
conclusion
that
if
you
would
like
us
to
carry
your
goods
instead
of
heinz
baby
foods,
where
a
seller
of
ingredients
that
go
into
your
good
a
garber
could
draw
the
inference
from
itself
or
it
might
be
made
explicit.
indeed,
in
this
case,
as
soon
as
the
acquisition
occur
the
former
gentry
officials,
now
consolidated
to
gentry
division,
ran
right
away
to
the
offices
of
consolidated
and
said
now
help
this
out
in
selling
to
various
companies,
including
garber
and
the
president
of
consolidated
as
shown
by
the
testimony
who
have
become
very
enthused
about
those
possibilities.
the
commission,
after
the
usual
proceedings,
found
that
this
merger
violated
section
7
and
issued
an
order
of
divestiture.
because
the
opinion
that
commissioner
elmond
delivered,
states
the
theory
of
the
commission
with
i
think
exceptional
clarity,
i
want
to
take
time
to
outline
its
reasoning
in
some
detail,
it's
really
the
essential
reasoning
of
our
case
here.
it
fell
into
three
parts;
first
the
commission
noted
the
opportunities,
noted
their
opportunities
for
reciprocal
buying,
are
likely
to
result
in
a
substantial
lessen
of
substantial
lessening
of
competitive
opportunities,
whenever
a
large
and
important
seller
is
able
to
command
patronage
from
--
a
command
patronage
for
his
goods,
from
the
customers
from
which
he
buys.
to
illustrate
the
point,
the
commission
called
attention
to
an
earlier
case
that
it
had
involving
the
waugh
equipment
company.
waugh
made
gears,
the
railroads
used
for
freight
cars.
it
was
--
the
railroads
were
buying
about
1%
of
their
goods
from
waugh.
armour
&
company
bought
up
waugh
within
six
years,
waugh
was
selling
36%
of
the
gears
that
the
railroads
used.
now
why
did
that
happen?
well
armour,
of
course,
was
one
of
the
biggest
shippers
over
the
railroads.
it
was
in
a
position
to
say
or
it
would
be
obvious
to
a
railroad
that
even
if
it
was
never
said,
did
a
good
way
to
get
armour's
patronage
as
a
shipper
was
to
buy
waugh
gears
and
the
result
as
i
say,
was
that
waugh's
sales
moved
from
1%
to
36%
within
a
six
year
period.
and
the
commission
had
a
number
of
other
illustration,
of
course,
as
an
expert
agency
in
this
area.
having
noted
the,
anti-competitive
effects
of
reciprocity
as
a
general
rule,
the
commission
then
find
it
out
that
this
merger
made
the
danger
what
it
called
a
practical
reality
in
the
present
case,
because
it
gave
consolidated
an
opportunity
previously
unavailable
to
repay
profit,
as
it
said,
from
sales
in
one
product
area,
dehydrated
onions
and
garlic,
on
the
sheer
strength
of
its
buying
power
in
other
markets
and
not
on
the
basis
of
a
better
price,
of
a
better
product
or
a
lower
price.
then
in
the
third
part
of
the
opinion,
the
commission
inquired
whether
that
threat
which
is
pointed
out
was
in
here
in
the
structure
of
the
market,
was
sufficiently
substantial
to
bring
the
merger
within
section
7.
since
respondent
repeatedly
asserts
that
the
commission
applied
as
its
actual
standard,
the
possibility
of
some
effect,
rather
than
the
probability
of
substantial
effect,
i
should
emphasize
that
the
opinion
very
clearly
disapproves
that
assertion.
at
page
67,
the
commission
then
addressing
itself
to
the
question
rather
the
potential
effect
on
competition
was
sufficiently
substantial
to
render
the
merger
unlawful,
said,
we
are
aware
that
congress
did
not
intend
section
7
to
apply
only
to
the
mere
possibility
that
competition
maybe
substantially
lessen.
it
then
went
on
to
quote
the
chief
justice's
opinion
in
the
brown
shoe
case
to
the
effect
that
section
7
was
concerned
with
probability.
mr.
archibald
cox
page
67.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
this
is
the
little
volume
in
the
front
of
the
record,
let
me
say
if
you
had
a
standard
volume
1.
mr.
archibald
cox
67
and
then
over
on
68,
began
on
67.
mr.
archibald
cox
a
little
bit,
then
it
goes
over
in
considering
this
question
we
are
aware
that
congress
did
not
intend
section
7
to
apply
only
to
mere
possibility.
then
quoting
from
brown
shoe,
congress
used
the
words
maybe
substantial
little
less
of
competition
to
indicate
that
it's
concerned
with
what
probabilities,
not
certainties
and
little
further
on
still
in
the
quotations,
mergers
with
a
probable
anti-
competitive
effect
were
to
be
prescribed
by
the
act
and
then
it
asked
what
are
the
probabilities
here?
so
while
we
may
argue
about
whether
the
evidence
stands
what
the
commission
did,
i
don't
think
there
could
be
any
question
that
to
try
and
to
apply,
the
standard
which
this
court
has
said
in
the
brown
shoe
case
and
following
other
cases
was
the
controlling
standard.
it
then
went
to
the
--
the
commission
then
went
on
to
call
attention
to
the
large
area
in
which
there
would
be
an
opportunity
for
reciprocal
dealing
in
this
case
because
of
course
the
size
of
the
threat
to
competition,
the
importance
of
the
threat
to
competition
depends
upon
how
much
of
the
market,
what
part
of
the
market
may
feel
the
operation
of
reciprocal
buying.
now
here
the
commission
pointed
out
just
about
25%
of
the
sales
of
onion
and
garlic
that
were
being
made
by
consolidated's
gentry
division,
the
acquired
company,
were
made
two
companies
from
home
during
this
period,
consolidated
was
also
an
important
buyer,
indeed
50%
of
all
the
purchases
in
the
market
were
made
by
those
companies
from
whom
consolidated
was
the
buyer,
but
only
25%
of
them
were
made
from
gentry.
but
there
was
a
share
of
the
market,
a
minimum
of
25%,
maximum
perhaps
50%,
it
would
feel
to
some
degree
or
other
or
another,
the
effect
of
consolidated's
influence
as
a
large
purchaser.
i
think
it's
clear,
if
you
think
of
this
as
one
who
was
considering
going
into
this
business
which
was
a
growing
and
rapidly
expanding
business,
increased
2.5
times
during
this
period,
that
if
you
saw
that
a
firm
like
consolidated
groceries
which
was
buying
from
those
people
who
were
likely
to
be
your
customers,
was
also
trying
to
sell
to
them
and
was
selling
about
25%
of
the
total
demand,
but
you
would
be
far
more
reluctant
to
go
into
that
business
and
of
course
this
effect
to
this
chilling
new
entries
is
a
factor
of
very
great
importance.
in
finding
a
probability
of
substantial
lessening
of
competition,
the
commission
mentioned
four
other
factors.
first
it
said,
that's
not
pointed
out
what
is
an
unquestioned
fact,
that
economic
power
in
the
onion
and
garlic
markets
was
already
very
concentrated.
gentry
had
29%
in
onion,
51%
in
garlic.
basic
had
equally
large
shares
of
the
together
they
were
up
between
80
and
90%.
so
this
was
an
area
where
power
was
already
excessively
concentrated.
second,
there's
no
â€“
second
consolidated
did
not
hesitate
to
attempt
to
use
the
power
of
reciprocity,
to
use
its
buying
power
to
induce
the
sales.
third,
as
i
suggested
a
moment
ago,
the
combination
of
this
29%
and
51%
already
there
plus
consolidated's
buying
power
as
a
potential
influence
over
buyers
of
onion
and
garlic,
would
tend
to
discourage
no
entry
and
the
commission
if
i
remember
correctly
called
attention
to
what
was
said
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case
about
the
importance
of
preserving
opportunities
for
new
entry
in
fields
so
they
are
already
heavily
concentrated.
and
finally
the
commission
noted
but
i
think
it
is
undisputable,
certainly
it's
not
yet
been
disputed,
that
no
benefit
to
competition
nor
any
economic
saving
or
other
business
advantage,
nor
indeed
any
redeeming
circumstance
was
assigned
to
justify
this
merger.
accordingly,
the
commission
concluded
that
the
merger
violated
section
7.
there
was
one
thing
more
that
i
should
emphasize,
it's
one
of
the
most
important
things
in
the
case,
about
proceedings
before
the
commission.
consolidated
introduced
evidence,
designed
to
show
that
during
the
seven
years
following
the
merger,
it
did
not
succeeded
in
improving
its
position
in
the
relevant
markets
and
adjudged
by
market
shares,
market
performance
in
that
sense
and
by
the
direct
testimony
of
purchasers
of
onion
and
the
garlic,
its
alleged
power
to
enforce
reciprocal
buying
had
not
up
to
then
severely
impaired
competition,
indeed
it
argued
that
it
had
not
up
to
then
impaired
competition
at
all.
the
commission
that
held
they
filed
that
evidence
might
show
that
consolidated
hadn't
injured
competition,
it
didn't
disproves
the
power.
it
considered
the
evidence
i
think
but
relegated
it
to
a
subsidiary
role
and
held
that
it's
did
not,
as
i
said,
dispose
the
existence
of
power
to
interfere
with
competition
as
a
result
of
the
merger
which
was
the
statutory
test.
the
court
of
appeals
however
said
that
this
evidence
of
market
performance
was
conclusive
and
accordingly
it
set
aside
the
commission's
order.
now
in
this
court
as
i
see
it,
the
ultimate
question
is
this,
was
the
commission
warranted
in
finding
that
the
merger
created
a
sufficient
probability
of
substantial
injury
to
competition
by
putting
consolidated
in
a
position
where
its
buying
power
by
influence
suppliers
to
purchase
gentry
onions
and
garlic,
consolidated's
onions
and
garlic
instead
of
those
offered
by
competitors
and
that
question
comes
out
with
three
things
that
are
important,
really
beyond
dispute.
first
it
is
beyond
dispute
i
submit
that
the
commission
did
make
that
critical
finding.
i
think
it's
equally
beyond
dispute
for
the
reason
i
stated
a
moment
ago
that
commission
applied
the
proper
test
and
the
only
way
one
can
reach
a
different
conclusion
is
to
say
that
they
weren't
telling
the
truth
when
it
asserted
that
that
was
the
test
it
was
applying
and
want
to
inquire
into
it.
and
third
it
is
or
at
least
should
be
common
ground
that
the
government
had
no
obligation
to
show
that
the
merger
had
actually
lessened
competition.
now
that
part
again
is
taken
care
of
by
the
brown
shoe
case
and
somewhat
earlier
was
certainly
foreshadowed
if
not
held
by
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
the
du
pont
case.
also
the
ultimate
question
as
i
say
then
this
in
a
sense
one
affect,
it
does
divide
itself
and
i
shall
divide
it
by
argument
into
what
are
in
another
sense
i
think
two
legal
issues.
one
is
whether
laying
aside
the
post
acquisition
evidence
for
a
moment,
the
commission
may
find
that
a
merger
will
probably
result
in
substantially
lessening
competition,
where
the
evidence
shows
that
the
merger
created
the
basic
competition,
basic
condition
of
conducive
to
reciprocal
dealing
in
a
large
part
of
what
is
here
and
already
concentrated
body.
the
basic
condition
being
of
course
a
company
would
with
buying
power,
selling
or
seeking
to
sell
other
products
to
those
from
whom
it
makes
its
purchases.
then
the
second
question
is
whether
assuming
that
we're
right
on
the
first
place,
the
evidence
of
market
performance
in
the
years
following
the
merger,
so
destroyed
the
government's
case
as
to
compel
a
finding
that
as
a
matter
of
law
the
merger
did
not
created
a
substantial
threat
to
competition.
the
foundation
of
the
commission's
finding
that
the
acquisition
would
probably
result
in
a
substantial
lessening
competition,
was
its
awareness
as
an
expert
body
that
opportunities
for
reciprocal
dealing
are
in
general
very
harmful
to
competition.
the
evils
of
reciprocity
were
noted
as
long
ago
as
adam
smith's
remark
that
it
was
the
spirit
of
monopoly
which
both
invented
and
propagated
this
doctrine,
he
was
speaking
i
should
say
of
national
trade,
not
domestic
trade,
but
i
can't
see
the
thing
again,
observation
is
any
of
the
less
pertinent
and
i
think
that
it
will
be
agreed
by
respondent
as
it
is
by
practically
every
commentator
that
there
is
no
economic
or
competitive
justification
of
our
reciprocal
dealing.

1951.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
proceeding
began
before
the
federal
trade
commission.
the
complaint
was
issued
either
the
--
in
1957,
some
years
it
was
--
yes
it
was
5
and
half
i
think.
the
trade
commission
began
investigating
when
a
complaint
not
in
the
technical
sense,
but
a
letter
was
sent
to
it
in
1954
that
was
its
investigation
and
there
was
a
delay
because
the
justice
department
was
also
conducting
other
investigations
in
the
same
firm,
and
there
was
a
matter
of
coordinating
them
and
then
the
proceeding
just
went
longer,
rather
slowly
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
must
say
from
then
on.
there
is
â€“
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
from
the
docket
entries,
i
looked
at
them,
no
particular
explanation
one
could
give
at
any
time.
the
first
three
is
two-and-a-half
years,
but
probably
not
knowing
about
them,
perhaps
some
orbit
resulted
from
the
fact
that
section
7
was
relatively
new,
that
may
or
may
not
be
an
excuse,
so
i
think
it
does
explain
part
of
what
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
hearings
were
very
long.
they
were
in
numerous
parts
of
country.
the
respondent
attempted
to
take
a
interlocutory
appeal
to
the
commission,
part
way
through
and
it
went
up,
and
then
it
went
back
down
again.
i
don't
want
to
say
to
your
honor
that
that
explains
the
whole
6
years,
it
plainly
doesn't.
each
part
of
the
thing
took
a
lot
of
time.
i'm
afraid
that's
all
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
can
say
about
my
way
of
explanation.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
as
we
â€“-
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
begin
to
get
some
rules,
one
of
which
we
would
help
to
get
here
and
such
as
were
laid
down
in
some
of
the
cases
that
it
should
greatly
simplify
the
trial
of
these
cases
and
equally
important,
more
important
i
guess
expedited.
i
refer
to
the
foundation,
the
starting
point
of
the
commission's
binding,
being
its
awareness
of
the
evils
of
the
opportunities
for
reciprocal
dealing
and
a
fortiori
of
reciprocal
dealing
itself.
the
objection
is
plain
enough.
it
introduces
into
the
market
an
advantage
resulting
from
concentration
of
economic
power
that
is
utterly
irrelevant
to
fair
competition
based
on
price,
quality,
service,
convenience
and
so
forth.
the
firm
which
has
such
vast
buying
power
as
armour
obviously
had
a
buying
transportation
or
consolidated
has
here
we
think
in
the
buying
groceries,
that
it's
patronage
is
important
to
suppliers,
if
it
is
permitted
to
acquire
a
manufacturing
firm
that
will
sell
to
those
suppliers,
is
then
in
a
position
to
say
if
it
has
to
say
it,
if
you
would
like
to
sell
to
me,
i
have
got
a
find
product,
i
think
the
price
is
right
and
i
like
to
deal
with
my
friend.
there
may
be
nothing
said,
the
letter
less
may
be
clear
enough
or
there
may
be
a
very
overt
threat,
there
may
be
tactful
dealing
in
between.
one
doesn't
need
to
go
beyond
the
present
record
to
find
illustrations
of
the
force
of
the
buying
power.
mr.
wilson
the
president
of
the
wilson
spice
company
testified,
i
am
sure
that
the
fact
that
we
were
selling
spices
or
packing
spices
for
consolidated
made
us
favor
them
more,
give
them
more
business
than
we
might
otherwise
have
given
them.
now
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
and
i
think
it's
of
some
importance
to
my
case
to
make
a
plan
that
we
are
not
arguing
that
the
power
of
reciprocal
buying
is
always
so
strong
that
it
enables
the
firm
acquiring
that
power
to
make
sales
utterly
without
regard
to
price
or
utterly
without
regard
to
quality
or
other
kinds
of
services.
the
advantage
may
be
big
one,
may
be
a
small
one,
perhaps
it
varies
from
case
to
case,
but
whether
it's
a
big
advantage
or
a
small
advantage
is
irrelevant.
the
important
point
is
that
it's
an
improper
advantage.
consolidated's
buying
power
or
armour's
in
my
illustration
in
one
market,
should
not
be
allowed
to
be
used
to
influence
sales
in
another
market.
as
applied
to
a
case
like
this
the
purpose
of
section
7
we
say
is
to
enable
gentry's
competitors,
gentry's
competitors
to
sell
onion
and
garlic
on
the
basis
of
price,
quality,
service,
other
merchandizing
factors,
without
having
to
take
on
the
additional
disadvantage
of
consolidated's
influence
as
a
large
part.
now
even
if
the
only
times
that
consolidated's
influence
had
any
force
were
when
everything
else
was
relatively
equal,
but
still
we
submit
consolidated
would
be
gaining
an
improper
advantage,
one
that
the
fellow
trying
to
sell
that
shouldn't
be
obliged
to
take
off.
i
have
already
mentioned
the
evidence
before
the
commission,
i
shouldn't
say
evidence,
the
information
before
the
commission
about
the
effects
of
commercial
reciprocity
on
competition,
and
about
the
way
traders
in
the
past
have
succumbed
to
the
varying
human
tendency
to
take
advantage
of
this.
it
is
worth
adding
an
addition
to
that
though
that
of
course
the
larger
the
firm,
or
the
more
diversified
the
business
the
greater
will
be
the
opportunities
for
reciprocity
and
a
trend
turns
mergers
of
diversified
firms
in
the
economy,
does
tend
to
increase
the
opportunities
for
reciprocity
and
thus
to
introduce
this
improper
factor
as
a
wider
and
wider
scale
--
on
a
wider
and
wider
scale
into
the
economy.
we
have
collected
the
writings
in
our
brief.
they
are
also
in
one
of
the
briefs
of
amicus.
i
don't
think
any
purpose
would
be
served
by
quoting
them
here.
it
is
a
matter
of
some
interest
that
many
concerns
have
already
put
systemized
their
reciprocity
program
to
the
extent
where
they
have
setup
departments
of
trade
relations
and
the
corporate
offices
in
those
departments
have
even
formed
a
trade
association
of
their
own.
the
result
of
course
as
i
said
a
moment
ago
is
to
make
it
harder
and
harder
for
the
independent
firm
that
is
unable
to
rely
on
this
factor.
now
as
i
understand
consolidated's
argument
in
the
present
case,
it
concedes
almost
everything
i
have
said
about
the
reciprocity
in
general.
it
says
that
the
commission
failed
to
prove
by
specific
evidence
in
this
record
that
consolidated
acquired
sufficient
reciprocity
power.
that
all
it
proved
is
the
at
most
the
structural
opportunity.
i
think
the
fallacy
lies
in
the
assumption
that
we
had
any
obligation
to
introduce
any
direct
evidence
upon
that
point.
in
appraising
the
probable
consequences
of
this
change
in
the
structure
of
the
business,
the
relevant
business,
the
commission
has
an
expert
body
was
entitled
to
draw
on
it's
knowledge
and
experience
as
well
of
course
if
that
is
it's
staff
i
mean
the
commission
as
an
institution.
he
--
from
this
he
did
know
as
i
have
argued
that
reciprocal
buying
is
not
only
an
unfair
advantage,
but
creating
opportunities
for
reciprocity
carries
the
potential
of
devastating
injury
competition.
a
second,
the
evidence,
the
proof
in
the
case,
showed
that
economic
power
in
the
onion
and
garlic
markets
was
already
heavily
concentrated
even
prior
to
the
merger.
third,
it
showed
that
consolidated
had
vast
buying
power
that
has
to
be
admitted.
and
it
showed
that
in
this
market,
a
very
large
part
of
the
purchases
of
onion
and
garlic
50%
were
made
by
firms
with
which
it
dealt
in
this
general
period
and
the
35%
of
the
purchases
were
being
made
from
it
consolidated
which
is
the
part
of
the
market
where
this
power
would
be
most
effective.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
that
would
be
one
step
more
removed,
i
think
if
the
retail
stores
were
out
we
would
be
saying
exactly
the
same
thing.
mr.
archibald
cox
consolidated
with
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
what
we
know
about
that
is
these
things.
in
addition
to
the
influence
that
might
be
drawn
in
general,
we
know
here
that
consolidated
officers
thought
they
had
some
leverage.
they
hastened
to
go
and
use
it.
the
testimony
for
example,
the
president
of
consolidated
when
he
was
asked
did
he
have
a
program,
does
your
company
have
a
policy
of
reciprocity,
he
replied
that
he
could
see
nothing
wrong
with
soliciting
business
in
the
normal
way
and
his
next
answer
has
indicated
that
he
regarded
calling
the
reciprocity
as
the
normal
solicitation
of
business.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
suggestion
that
i
think
that
consolidated
was
all
the
way
out
of
here.
its
sales
[voice
overlap]
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
sales
as
a
distributor
increased
very,
very
rapidly
during
this
period.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes--
or
they
be.
mr.
archibald
cox
they
were
picking
up
distributors
all
the
time.
mr.
archibald
cox
they
also
picked
up
some
process.
they
were
engaged
--
i
don't
mean
that
they
may
not
have
--
they
weren't
engaged
in
other
attempts
to
diversify.
what
i
would
say
here
justice
white
that
no
such
suggestion,
no
such
defense
was
put
forward
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true,
but
i
don't,
in
all
candor,
i
don't
think
the
commission
relied
on
its
position
as
a
retailer
particularly.
it
was
thinking
of
its
power
as
buying
from
wholesale
distribution
and
i
wouldn't
think
i
could
stress
the
others
also
to
the
extent
they
had
changed
is
an
effect.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
indeed
the
commission
pointed
out
and
i
haven't
seen
anything
in
the
briefs
to
the
contrary
that
nothing
was
offered
that
there
was
no
redeeming
circumstance
pointed
out.
in
addition
to
the
evidence
that
consolidated
did
hurry
to
use
it's
purchasing
power
in
an
effort
to
bring
about
sales
of
onion,
there
was
testimony
that
it
did
on
a
number
of
occasions
succeed.
earlier
i
mentioned
the
testimony
from
the
president
wilson
spice.
in
the
testimony
it's
conceded
that
they
succeeded
in
the
case
of
j.j
gielow
and
also
that
they
succeeded
in
a
degree
in
the
case
i
think
it's
of
illinois
meat
company.
i
have
mentioned
before
the
amount
of
the
market
which
was
susceptible
of
this
--
of
this
influence
and
the
already
concentrated
condition
of
the
market.
now
taking
all
those
together
--
mr.
archibald
cox
because
this
was
a
â€“-
mr.
archibald
cox
--
this
was
a
concern
which
even
without
the
addition
of
this
added
power
as
we
see
it,
the
purchasing
power,
already
dominated
the
market
to
the
point
where
it
would
make
it
difficult
for
new
entrants
to
come
in
and
whereas
the
court
said
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case,
it
was
correspondingly
important
to
preserve
the
opportunities
for
new
entrants
so
that
there
might
be
de-concentration.
now
think
of
this
in
terms
of
one
of
the
little
sellers
of
garlic
and
onion,
the
fact
that
this
great
big
fellow
who
overshadowed
them
in
terms
of
this
relative
size
in
this
market
--
mr.
archibald
cox
has
got
still
more
selling
power.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think,
first,
i
should
create
a
correct
an
inadvertent
the
statement
that
i
made
yesterday,
although
it's
not
a
point,
it's
not
very
essential.
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
at
page
is
1664
and
1665,
to
the
effect
that
in
1950
the
wholesale
grocery
business
was
declining,
and
that
consolidated,
then
began
to
move
into
the
retail
field.
it
bought
some
chains
which
are
identified
in
briefs.
it
also
attempted
to
organize
some
retailers,
and
the
cardinal
stores
on
a
somewhat
loser
basis
without
buying
into
them,
but
making
them
a
chain
that
it
would
help
to
manage.
as
far
as
i
can
ascertain,
the
record
does
not
show,
how
far
consolidated
had
become
engaged
in
purchasing
for
resale
at
retail,
and
how
far
it
was
still
purchasing
for
resale
at
wholesale,
by
the
time
this
record
was
closed.
but,
i
don't
think
the
point
is
of
the
essence,
because
in
any
event
it
was
a
large
buyer,
and
i
suppose
also
we
don't
lay
any
stress
on
it,
that
it's
power
as
a
buyer
for
immediate
sale
at
retail
was
perhaps
more
important
than
it's
power
as
a
buyer,
as
a
wholesaler
where
it
would
have
to
buy
what
it
could
sell
instead
of
choosing
what
went
on
shelves
itself,
but
i
don't
make
anything
at
that
point.
i
just
want
to
correct
any
misapprehension
i
might
have
left
with
the
court.
now,
yesterday,
i
was
directing
myself
throughout
the
argument
to
the
question
whether
the
commission
was
warranted,
leaving
the
evidence
of
post-acquisition
market
behavior
aside
for
the
moment,
was
warranted
in
finding
that
this
merger
created
a
probable
injury
to
competition,
within
the
meaning
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
in
a
nutshell,
the
case,
i
think
comes
down
to
this.
the
record
shows,
that
consolidated
was
a
customer
of
concerns
buying
from
25%
to
50%
of
the
onion
and
garlic.
indeed,
that
it
was
a
customer
of
firms
buying
25%
from
the
gentry
division,
that
became
part
of
consolidated.
it
was
also
a
very
large
purchaser.
in
addition,
the
record
shows
that
the
merger
gave
consolidated
at
the
absolute
dominant
position
in
the
onion
and
garlic
market
and
as
i
said
before,
25%
of
all
sales
were
made
to
its
customers.
we
also
know
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
consolidated
was
ready,
able
and
willing,
and
it
was
ready
and
willing
and
at
least
in
some
cases
able
to
use
its
purchasing
power
to
acquire
sales,
to
break
into
the
new
markets
of
garlic
and
onion.
i
think,
we
know
as
a
matter
of
commonsense
and
of
commercial
experience,
that
buying
power
in
other
markets
can
be
used
and
has
been
used
in
a
number
of
instances
with
devastating
affect
in
foreclosing
the
market
you
are
concerned
with,
two
independent
competitors
who
lack
that
leverage.
now,
we
would
say
taking
this
together,
and
still
for
the
moment,
leaving
aside
the
post-acquisition
evidence,
that
it's
indeed
a
necessary
inference,
that
the
combination
of
the
two
powers
creates
or
may
substantially
lessen
competition
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
that
it
creates
sufficient
probability
of
injury
to
independent
competitor
to
cause
section
7
to
apply.
that
was
the
conclusion
that
the
district
court
and
the
third
circuit
reached
in
a
comparable
situation,
in
the
ingersoll
rand
case
cited
in
our
briefs,
but
we
don't
need
to
go
quite
that
far
here.
all
we
need
to
argue
is
that
the
federal
trade
commission
could
draw
this
conclusion,
because
after
all,
the
very
purpose
of
creating
the
federal
trade
commission,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
cement
institute
case,
i
wish
i'd
quoted
it
in
my
brief,
the
whole
purpose
of
setting
up
the
commission
was
to
have
a
body
that
was
capable
of
appraising
the
affects.
in
that
case,
various
competitive
practices
with
basing
point
system,
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
as
amended
of
appraising
the
effects
of
various
structural
changes
in
the
market,
and
what
they
were
likely
to
do
to
competition.
the
commission,
remember,
was
according
to
legislative
history
made
the
principal
instrument
for
enforcing
section
7,
so
that
it's
expertise
could
be
brought
to
bare.
i
think
in
the
sense,
the
answer
to
the
argument
that
the
respondents
make
here,
about
there
being
no
evidence
concerning
the
degree
of
probability
is
that,
the
answer
that
was
made
in
the
republic
aviation
case
in
dealing
with
the
labor
board.
there,
the
proof
showed
only
that
there
was
a
company
rule,
barring
the
solicitation
of
union
members
of
the
plant
and
wearing
of
union
buttons.
and
the
company
argued
well
there
was
no
testimony
concerning
the
extent
to
which
this
will
interfere
with
union
organization.
and
the
company
replies
that,
that's
something
--
the
court
replied
that
is
something
for
an
expert
body
like
the
labor
board
to
infer
from
the
facts,
one
of
the
purposes
it
said
which
lead
to
the
creation
of
such
boards
is
to
have
decisions
based
upon
evidential
facts
under
the
particular
statue,
made
by
experienced
officials
with
an
adequate
appreciation
of
the
subject
interested
their
administration.
to
move
to
still
another
area
in
the
market
street
railway
case,
it
was
held
at
a
public
utilities
commission
could
infer
that
a
lowering
of
the
rates,
and
being
a
fares
on
a
street
railway
could
infer
without
direct
testimony
that
that
would
resolved
in
an
increase
of
passenger
traffic.
and
the
same
thing
has
been
applied
during
the
cement
institute
case,
and
in
the
morton
salt
case
to
the
federal
trade
commission.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
am
just
going
to
move
onto
the
post-acquisition
efforts,
alright?
and
i
will
deal
with
that
now.
the
answer
in
a
sentence
justice
harlan
that
i
will
elaborate
is
that
we
think
that
the
evidence
was
relevant,
but
not
such
as
to
compel
the
conclusion
that
the
threat
to
competition
was
not
sufficiently
substantial.
the
post-acquisition
evidence
falls
essentially
into
two
parts,
one
is
the
statistical
part,
showing
that
during
the
subsequent
years,
it's
about
seven
years,
seven-and-a-half
years
that
in
the
garlic
market,
consolidated
lost
shares.
it
didn't
have
as
large
a
percentage
as
before.
indeed,
the
share
fell
from
51%
to
39%.
in
the
onion
market,
its
share
went
up
25%.
25%
of
what
it
had
been
before,
it
had
been
28%
and
it
became
35%.
mr.
archibald
cox
25%
of
what
it
had
been.
the
7%
is
25%
of
28.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
was
what
i
tried
to
say,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record
bearing
on
that.
it
deals
particularly
with
the
quality
of
the
products.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
and
there
was
also
with
respect
to
the
garlic,
a
failure
to
keep
pace
with
the
technological
competition.
we
say
essentially
two
things.
first,
we
rely
on
the
point
the
commission
made
that
the
failure
to
gain
in
both
markets,
a
larger
share
maybe
explainable
only
by
the
fact
that
consolidated
wasn't
using
all
its
power
during
this
period,
and
we
are
concerned
with
power
not
actual
consequences.
second,
we
suggest
that
the
proof
of
the
movement
in
the
sales
does
not
show
that
the
reciprocal
purchasing
power
was
not
operable
as
a
factor.
true,
it
is
only
one
factor
that
comes
into
play,
but
we
don't
suggest
that
quality,
price
and
things
like
that
were
not
elements.
indeed
in
this
respect,
it
seems
to
be
and
again
i
wish
the
case
within
our
brief,
that
this
case
is
very
similar
to
the
dupont
case.
there
are
other
differences,
but
you'll
recall
it
in
the
dupont
case
the
argument
was
made
that
dupont
did
not
enjoy
a
constant
share
of
general
motor's
business
that
after
the
acquisition
at
times
it
share
declined
and
there
was
testimony
and
a
finding
by
the
district
court,
that
general
motors
was
concerned
with
price
and
quality,
in
purchasing
its
paints,
the
leather
that
it
acquired
from
dupont
and
others,
but,
the
court
said
that
all
those
facts
didn't
make
any
difference.
that
the
evidence
did
show
that
dupont
by
acquiring
the
general
motors
stock
had
acquired
an
ability
to
get
sales
on
a
basis
other
than
price,
quality,
and
the
normal
competitive
thing.
so,
here
we
say
that
consolidated
had
acquired
that
capacity,
and
it
may
well
have
been,
that
it
used
it
in
some
instances
and
not
in
others.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
the
evidence
very
strongly
suggests
that
it
may
well
have
been
holding
some
sales
in
acquiring
others
on
the
basis
of
its
purchasing
power.
so,
far
as
the
garlic
went,
there
was
testimony
by
dr.
prater
to
the
affect
that
for
many
years
they've
been
the
leader
in
garlic,
had
the
best
quality
and
the
largest
share,
but
that
they
lost
that
because
they
had
not
spend
the
time,
money
and
effort,
and
had
not
built
a
separate
plant
to
handle
garlic,
had
not
carried
on
research.
so,
it's
not
surprising
that
they
lost
sales,
even
though
this
was
a
factor
in
the
market.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
turn
and
look
at
the
onions,
they
were
gaining
sales
7%
of
the
whole,
an
additional
25%
over
what
they
had.
it's
suggested
in
the
brief
of
the
company,
well,
the
figures
don't
show
that
purchasing
power
had
--
and
it
came
into
play
because
we
sold
on
33%
of
the
whole
market
in
1936,
and
we
sold
only
31%
and
lower
percentages
of
the
sales,
of
the
groups
of
companies
who
were
our
suppliers
in
the
processed
foods
market.
now,
of
course,
all
that
shows
is
that
there
were
some
people
who
bought
consolidated's
onions,
who
bought
more
than
33%
of
their
onions
from
the
consolidated.
i
think,
the
really
important
test
would
be
how
did
consolidated
fair
among
its
suppliers,
where
its
purchasing
power
might
come
into
play
as
compared
to
the
part
of
the
market
which
apparently
was
not
its
suppliers.
now,
we
do
know
who
its
suppliers
were
in
this
period.
we
don't
know
what
they
bought
in
particular
years,
but
it's
a
constant
universe,
and
the
figures
are
quite
interesting.
in
1951,
the
sales
to
those
who
were
consolidated
suppliers,
were
one
million
eight
roughly
and
the
sales
to
others
who
were
not
among
its
suppliers,
where
one
million
seven.
by
1955,
the
sales
to
its
suppliers
were
2
billion
5,
that's
a
35%
increase
and
the
sales
to
others
were
down
to
one
million
three,
a
30%
decrease.
by
1958,
the
sales
to
suppliers
were
up
to
four
million
six
that
would
be
a
146%
increase
over
1951,
and
the
sales
to
others
were
down
to
one
million
six,
still
not
what
they
were
in
1951.
now,
1951
may
not
be
an
entirely
reliable
base
year.
so
i
ran
a
similar
check
taking
1950
as
a
base.
you
find
that
consolidated
gentry
sales
rose
from
two
million
one
to
six
million
â€“
looks
as
if
i
must
made
a
mistake,
to
six
million
two
--
oh!
that's
the
total,
from
two
million
one
to
six
million
two
and
that
80%
of
that
was
attributable
to
set
sales
to
consolidated
suppliers.
so,
it
was
doing
much
better
in
the
market
where
it
did
have
this
--
in
the
part
of
the
market
where
it
did
have
this
leverage,
so
far
as
onion
went,
then
it
was
in
the
other
part.
and
of
course
any
technological
change
would
be
operable
in
both
parts.
now,
i
don't
contend,
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear,
that
this
shows
the
reciprocal
purchasing
power
at
work,
because
the
commission
didn't
find
that.
all
i
argue
is
that
this
shows
that
the
post-acquisition
evidence
isn't
very
compelling,
that
you
could
draw
various
inferences
from
it.
that
it
says
sort
of
[inaudible]
you
can
look
at
it
one
way
or
look
at
it
another
way,
and
that
consequently
commission
were
simply
entitled
to
take
into
account
along
with
the
risk,
that
they
concluded
that
ultimate
question
was
whether
an
improper
power
carrying
sufficient
probability
of
injury
had
been
interjected
into
this
market.
now
the
other
part
of
the
testimony
concerning
the
post-acquisition
period
was
direct
evidence
from
various
suppliers
to
consolidated
and
purchasers
of
onions
and
garlic
from
consolidated,
saying
well,
we
weren't
influenced
by
the
threats
of
purchasing
power.
to
that
very
briefly,
we
give
much
the
same
answer
that
we
gave
in
the
case
of
the
statistics.
first,
we
say,
that
there
were
instances
where
admittedly
its
purchasing
power
did
pry
open
the
market.
second,
we
say,
that
if
you
look
at
all
the
evidence
with
respect
to
the
firms
that
testified,
that
they
were
influenced
by
consolidated's
purchasing
power.
you
find
a
number
of
instances
where
they
was
controversy,
where
they
was
other
testimony
that
threw
doubt
on
that
direct
evidence.
that's
particularly
true
in
the
case
gerber's
foods
and
the
morgan
packing
company.
so
that
again
we
think,
first
of
the
instances
in
which
it
countered
the
purchasing
power
are
more
important
than
the
instances
in
which
it
didn't,
because
those
were
the
proofs
that
there
was
some
power
and
second,
it
adds
to
the
other,
again
to
inquire
into
the
particular
facts
in
the
post-acquisition
period,
which
isn't
too
long
when
one
thinks
of
being
probable
life
of
this
industry
in
the
long
run
development,
that
the
commission
was
certainly
entitled
to
hold
fast
to
those
facts
that
where
known
about
market
structure,
and
it
based
conclusion
upon
them,
instead
of
being
compelled
to
disregard
to
compelled
by
the
debatable
post-acquisition
evidence
to
reach
a
contrary
conclusion.
i
would
like
mr.
chief
justice
to
save
what
time
i've
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
most
useful
thing
i
can
do
during
my
rebuttal
is
to
try
to
restate
what
the
government's
position
is
here,
because
i
think
mr.
walker
has
in
his
enthusiasm
considerably
misstated
it.
we
do
rely,
most
emphatically
upon
the
figures,
the
invented
figures
concerning
market
shares
in
this
case.
it
was
made
of
the
utmost
importance
by
the
commission,
and
i
thought
it
was
made
of
almost
borrowing
reputation
in
my
argument,
that
gentry,
and
therefore
consolidated
was
already
a
dominant,
one
of
the
two
dominant
firms
in
these
markets,
that
it
had
around
a
third
of
them
to
combine
51%
of
one,
28%
of
the
other
at
the
beginning,
and
that
is
a
very
important
effect.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
certainly
say
it
was
a
very
different
case
and
i
doubt
that
we
would
be
here
arguing,
but
i
would
certainly
say
it
was
a
very
different
case.
they
have
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
was
a
little
fellow
and
i
would
think
that
in
a
market
way
you
had
two
great
big
firms
justice
white,
that
the
addition
of
this
additional
power
as
you
were
suggesting,
will
probably
made
no
difference.
the
other
effect
that
is
surely
relevant,
and
that
the
commission
laid
great
stress,
and
there
is
no
difference
between
me
and
my
client
in
this
case,
was
that
gentry,
consolidated,
it
was
making
25%
of
the
sales
to
people
who
were
its
customers,
and
this
was
the
minimum
amount
of
the
market
where
the
power;
its
buying
power
in
other
market
could
be
found.
now
as
they
were
--
if
only
--
if
its
customers
were
only
2%
of
the
purchases
in
the
market
for
seasoning,
one
again
would
have
a
very
different
story,
and
i
don't
purport
to
say
except
in
general
words
like
substantial,
just
where
the
line
lies.
this
is
the
federal
trade
commission
case.
it
decided
it
on
the
facts
before
it,
and
we
tribute
great
significance
to
that.
now,
second
i
think
i
might
suggest
a
word
about
our
position
concerning
the
statues.
if
consolidated
had
built
the
necessary
processing
plants
and
gone
into
the
onion
and
garlic
market
through
internal
expansion
as
they
sometime
say
that
incurs
there
would
be
no
section
7
case
under
the
clayton
act.
if
it
used
the
power
of
reciprocal
buying
and
perhaps
it
did
attempted
to
use
then
there
would
be
a
case
under
section
5
of
federal
trade
commission
act.
i
think
it
would
be
under
that
mr.
justice
white
rather
than
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
in
that
one
wouldn't
read
section,
might
be
an
monopolizing
case
if
they
got
big
enough,
but
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission
act
would
be
the
one
primarily
[inaudible]
mr.
archibald
cox
if
there
was
actually
reciprocity
operating
there
would
be
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
the
question
would
be
we'd
have
a
section
5
case
under
the
federal
trade
â€“
mr.
archibald
cox
section
1?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
think
it
would
be
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
that
we
would
use
if
anything.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
we
would
lose
under
that
[laughter]
that's
why
i
say
if
anything,
if
we
use
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
it
seems
to
me
a
fortiori
we
would
lose
since
section
7
is
stricter
than
section
1.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
i
also,
i
thought
i
said
in
the
answer
to
your
honor's
question
a
minute
ago
that
if
they
had
acquired
puccinelli
it
would
have
been
entirely
different
case
which
certainly
this
case
would
not
lead
to
saying
that
they
couldn't
acquire
puccinelli.
i
think
that
in
this
market
given
all
these
facts
that
acquiring
puccinelli
no
harm
done,
probably
been
a
fine
thing,
it
would
have
introduced
some
competition
in
the
market.
mr.
archibald
cox
then
it
would
be,
then
it
might
be
a
section
1
question.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
using
reciprocal
buying
power
although
we
don't
have
to
pass
on
it
here,
we
would
say
was
an
unfair
method
of
competition
and
i
suppose
an
agreement
to
use
it
by
â€“
held
to
be
here
an
agreement
that
violates
section
1.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
you
now
put
the
case,
i
think
it
would
a
section
1
case.
it
would
have
an
element,
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
here
and
that
is
puccinelli
little
in
the
market
whereas
gentry
was
big
and
i
do
stress
that
as
an
element
of
the
case.
now,
the
second
point
on
which
i
think
mr.
walker
is
building
in
a
straw
man
is
that
we
do
not
say,
i
don't
think
we
say
in
that
brief
and
i
certainly
did
not
say
oral
argument,
i
said
just
the
opposite.
we
do
not
say
that
this
post-acquisition
evidence
was
irrelevant.
i
think
that
it
clearly
is
we
concede
it's
relevance
on
the
issue
of
whether
consolidated
acquired
power
to
use
this
leverage.
we
do
say
that
it
is
not
compelling
and
that
commission
that
evaluated
it
and
that
it
did
not
disprove
the
existence
of
this
improper
leverage
in
the
onion
and

market.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
was
simply
going
to
add
that
we
do
not
agree
either
where
the
many
statements
in
the
reply
brief
to
the
affect
that
reciprocity
was
ineffective.
i
say
particularly,
i
was
going
to
take
a
minute
to
read
it
but
i
say
it
particularly
the
evidence
concerning
gerber
which
and
the
salesman's
report
concerning
the
efforts
to
sell
to
gerber
which
appear
along
about
page
2268
of
the
record
and
the
evidence
concerning
morgan
packing
company
in
the
form
of
admissions
by
consolidated
along
about
page
2086
of
the
record.
now,
there
are
many
instances
where
people
testify
generally
that
they
were
buying
on
the
basis
of
quality
and
price,
but
when
you
scrutinize
it,
you
find
there
was
a
good
deal
of
testimony
the
other
way.
this
was
one
of
things
which
we
say
leads
to
discounting
the
post-acquisition
evidence
and
relying
primarily
on
market
structure.
thank
you.
