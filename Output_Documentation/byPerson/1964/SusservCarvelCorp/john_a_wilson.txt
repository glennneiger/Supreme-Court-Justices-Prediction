mr.
john
a.
wilson
h.p.
hood
&
sons.
mr.
john
a.
wilson
that's
a
dairy
--
one
of
the
dairies.
the
petitioners
originally
or
brought
these
actions
ori
--
primarily
against
carvel.
but
they
have
included
also
a
group
of
supplier,
dependents
of
whom
hood
is
one.
a
group
which
we
submit
is
clearly
peripheral
in
the
carvel
franchise
operation.
now
what
succinctly
does
hood
--
this
quality
diary
product
company
do?
hood
manufacturers
and
sells
to
carvel
under
supply
contract
a
special
type
and
kind
of
ice
cream
mix
such
as
it
manufacturers
for
no
one
else.
this
mix
is
prepared
according
to
a
secret
recipe
or
formula
which
was
originated
by
carvel
and
which
carvel
furnishes
to
hood.
carvel
also
furnishes
to
hood
what
are
called
the
stabilizer
and
the
emulsifier
used
in
the
making
of
this
mix.
now
it
is
significant
that
the
petitioners
in
their
brief
had
made
no
mention
of
the
fact
so
far
as
i
could
discern
that
the
ice
cream
mix
under
carvel's
special
is
made
under
the
special
secret
formula
of
carvel
that
carvel
furnishes
to
hood
the
stabilizer
and
emulsifier
and
that
systematically
carvel
inspects
hood's
plant
to
ensure
the
high-quality
and
(inaudible)
--
sanitary
quality
of
the
entire
manufacturing
operations.
it
would
seem
at
least
as
though
this
rather
glaring
omission
pointed
rather
strongly
to
the
extreme
vulnerability
of
the
petitioners'
case
against
hood.
now
just
a
word
of
a
culinary
nature
about
this
matter
of
mix,
what
is
it?
it's
a
fluid,
white
in
color.
i'm
told
by
the
culinary
experts
to
properly
describe
as
bland
--
mr.
john
a.
wilson
it
--
bland,
b-l-a-n-d
which
i
take
to
be
neutral
and
susceptible
of
hyping
up
with
certain
sauces
and
toppings
and
everything.
mr.
john
a.
wilson
no,
hood
manufactures
the
mix.
mr.
john
a.
wilson
it
manufactures
the
mix
and
i'm
describing
the
nature
of
this
mix.
it
is
fluid.
mr.
john
a.
wilson
it
is
white
in
color.
it
has
an
emulsifier
and
a
stabilizer
in
it
and
other
than
that,
this
is
a
secret
formula
which
even
i
do
not
posses
and
wouldn't
understand
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
a.
wilson
it
contains
--
it
contains
--
mr.
john
a.
wilson
well,
that
--
that's
about
it.
it's
what
the
record
says,
a
mix
--
this
mix
is.
and
it
has
to
be
held
in
refrigeration.
mr.
john
a.
wilson
yes?
mr.
john
a.
wilson
yes.
i
think
--
mr.
john
a.
wilson
i
think
some
sort
of
--
mr.
john
a.
wilson
we
get
--
mr.
john
a.
wilson
--
the
emulsifier
and
the
stabilizer
--
mr.
john
a.
wilson
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
in
(inaudible)
--
i
think
to
--
ensuring
the
firmness
of
the
fluid
product.
mr.
john
a.
wilson
that's
a
--
no,
that's
an
ingredient.
mr.
john
a.
wilson
(inaudible)
mr.
john
a.
wilson
it
gets
it
directly
from
carvel.
mr.
john
a.
wilson
those
are
the
only
two
things
so
far
as
i
know.
mr.
john
a.
wilson
the
stabilizer
is
an
ingredient
and
so
is
the
emulsifier.
mr.
john
a.
wilson
the
milk
and
maybe
something
else,
i
really
don't
know
it
is
a
secret.
mr.
john
a.
wilson
yes,
whatever
the
secret
formula
is,
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
record
and
i
personally
haven't
been
let
in
on
this
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
a.
wilson
no,
it's
fluid.
and
it
has
to
be
kept
in
sealed
cans
and
it's
subject
to
deterioration.
it
cannot
be
readily
warehoused.
and
that
i
think
is
a
significant
fact.
and
the
point
(inaudible)
mr.
john
a.
wilson
that's
right.
mr.
john
a.
wilson
now
--
mr.
john
a.
wilson
no,
we
do
not
make
the
ice
cream.
i'm
going
to
explain
the
process
in
just
a
moment
your
honor.
we
make
only
the
mix.
this
mix
which
is
delivered
in
10-gallon
cans
and
the
description
of
it
so
far
as
i'm
able
to
give
it
to
you,
perhaps
my
friend
is
more
expert
in
that
matter
but
it
is
a
secret
formula
and
that
is
what
could
--
delivers
to
the
operators
according
to
the
instructions
of
carvel
in
10-gallon
cans.
mr.
john
a.
wilson
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
john
a.
wilson
i
cannot
tell
you
because
in
truth
and
in
fact
is
it
a
secret.
mr.
john
a.
wilson
yes.
it
was
originated
by
carvel
and
it's
only
in
imitable
ways
and
delivered
to
hood
and
hood
makes
that
by
the
--
with
the
addition
of
two
ingredients
namely
the
stabilizer
and
the
emulsifier
supplied
directly
by
carvel.
mr.
john
a.
wilson
no,
we
do
not.
now,
this
mix
as
i've
indicated
is
a
perishable
product.
it
is
therefore
delivered
by
hood
on
instructions
of
carvel
directly
to
certain
carvel
retail
ice
cream
stores,
these
roadside
stores
that
we
see.
stores
located
so
far
as
hood
is
concerned
only
in
the
states
of
massachusetts
and
connecticut,
that's
all.
now,
this
direct
delivery
is
necessary
to
avoid
warehousing
with
consequent
delay
which
would
lead
to
the
deterioration
of
the
product
with
possible
damage,
i
think
almost
certain
damage
to
the
public
health.
now,
may
i
say
in
passing
that
the
court
should
not
draw
the
erroneous
conclusion
that
hood
does
a
considerable
volume
of
business
with
carvel.
the
court
might
possibly
do
so
from
the
statement
which
appears
in
the
petitioner's
brief
that
carvel
has
about
400
franchise
stores
and
delivers
and
has
these
stores
in
9
or
10
states
and
that
carvel
so
the
petitioners
state
in
their
brief
sells
to
store
operators
more
than
two
million
gallons
of
mix
annually.
for
the
total
business
(inaudible)
which
hood
actually
does
with
carvel
is
in
fact
very
small.
hood
delivers
not
to
400
retail
stores
in
9
or
10
states
but
only
to
stores
in
the
two
states
of
massachusetts
and
connecticut
and
to
an
average
of
about
approximately
32
stores
per
year.
and
hood
deliver
--
the
--
now,
i
would
like
to
make
this
very
clear
that
the
sole
issue
pertaining
to
hood
is
whether
these
supply
contracts
under
which
it
supplies
the
mix,
whether
these
supply
contracts,
evidence,
practices
or
agreements
which
constitute
per
se
violations
of
antitrust
laws.
i
think
it
must
be
clearly
understood
that
the
petitioners
here
concede
that
there
is
no
combination
between
the
supplier
defendants
and
between
the
supplier
defendants
in
carvel.
that
is
there
is
no
sort
of
conspiratorial
round
robin
in
which
all
participate.
they
admit
that
they
charge
only
that
carvel
is
violating
the
antitrust
laws
by
a
series
of
agreements
going
out
from
carvel
separately
like
the
spokes
of
a
wheel
to
each
of
the
supplier
defendants.
now,
very
briely
what
do
these
carvel
supply
contracts
--
carvel-hood
supply
contracts
provide?
hood
agrees
to
manufacture
and
sell
to
carvel
all
the
carvel
mix
required
by
carvel
stores
located
in
massachusetts
and
connecticut.
carvel
agrees
to
purchase
from
hood
all
of
such
requirements.hood
also
agrees
to
manufacture
the
carvel
mix
according
to
this
special
secret
mix
formula
furnished
to
hood
by
carvel,
originated
by
carvel
and
it
agrees
not
to
disclose
that
formula
to
any
unauthorized
person.
and
hood
agrees
to
deliver
only
carvel
mix
to
carvel
stores
and
no
other
mix
and
no
other
ice
cream
preparation
to
those
stores.
now
at
the
trial,
the
following
facts
were
established
by
hood
without
contradiction
of
any
kind,
they
maybe
taken
as
established
beyond
any
peradventure
of
a
doubt.
they
were
established
not
only
by
stipulation
with
the
plaintiffs
but
by
the
uncontroverted
live
testimony
of
hood's
witness,
walter
simons.
these
facts
in
summary
are
these,
that
hood
was
not
a
party
to
and
had
no
knowledge
whatsoever
of
carvel's
franchise
agreements
or
any
other
contracts
which
carvel
had
with
the
store
operators.
that
hood
never
saw
and
had
no
knowledge
of
what
has
been
called
the
standard
operating
procedure
manual
and
that
had
--
hood
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
manner
in
which
these
stores
or
any
of
them
were
operated.
and
that
carvel
process
the
mix
according
to
carvel's
secret
formula
which
differs
from
all
other
ice
cream
mixes
manufactured
by
hood.
these
were
the
established
facts.
and
in
addition,
these
facts
were
established
beyond
any
question
that
hood
did
not
participate
in
the
determination
of
the
prices
at
which
carvel
sold
ice
--
its
ice
cream
mix
to
the
store
operators
or
in
the
determination
of
the
prices
to
the
public
of
any
of
carvel's
dairy
products
made
with
this
ice
cream
mix
as
a
component.
now
we
submit
that
the
carvel-hood
supply
contracts
involved
neither
per
se
violations
or
antitrust
law
nor
indeed
any
other
violations
of
antitrust
law.
they
cannot
possibly
be
said
to
be
pernicious
in
their
effects
upon
competition
or
lacking
in
the
so-called
redeeming
virtues
or
in
any
sense
to
be
unreasonable
so
that
their
consequent
illegality
must
be
presumed.
hood's
proof
affirmatively
established
--
establishes
that
the
contracts
are
reasonable
and
proper
for
the
protection
not
only
of
the
legitimate
proprietary
interests
of
carvel
but
also
of
the
store
operators
themselves.
and
further
and
more
important,
they
are
necessary
for
the
protection
of
the
interests
of
the
consuming
public.
and
there
is
no
proof
whatsoever
that
they
have
any
adverse
effect
upon
competition
and
certainly,
certainly
not
a
pernicious
effect.
mr.
john
a.
wilson
oh,
pardon.
mr.
john
a.
wilson
i
didn't
--
mr.
john
a.
wilson
is
that
15
minutes?
