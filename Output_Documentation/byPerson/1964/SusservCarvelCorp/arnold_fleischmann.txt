mr.
arnold
fleischmann
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justice
of
the
supreme
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
of
a
tying
arrangement
within
the
context
of
a
franchise
system.
carvel,
the
respondents
are
the
franchise
source
of
a
chain
of
soft
ice
cream
stores,
roadside
stores,
stores
which
serve
the
general
public.
they
have
licensed
approximately
400
such
stores,
approximately
250
of
which
are
located
in
the
area
about
which
we're
primarily
concerned.
these
stores
are
of
interest
to
the
independent
businessman,
the
independent
businessman
who
wants
to
be
his
own
boss,
who
wants
to
be
on
his
own.
when
carvel
went
into
the
franchising
business,
is
--
it
undertook
a
very
strong
campaign
to
publicize
the
values
and
qualities
of
its
franchise.
these
values
were
constantly
repeated
in
daily
newspapers.
they
appeared
in
television
and
we
have
a
very
brief
outline
of
them
on
page
7
of
our
reply
brief
--
oh,
page
6
on
the
reply
brief.
these
items
are
the
ones
which
we
consider
to
be
the
essential
ones
to
the
value
of
the
franchise.
they
are
--
and
this
is
what
the
independent
businessman
who
wants
to
become
a
carvel
franchisee
since
they
are
the
expert
guidance
which
the
franchisor
can
furnish.
they
are
the
good
location
and
they
are
the
recipes
and
the
techniques
that
make
for
success.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
carvel
has
very
well
publicized
that
and
--
one
of
the
exhibits
introduced
in
this
case
by
carvel
specifically
refers
to
it.
it
is
on
page
427
in
the
lower
left-hand
corner,
where
carvel
describes
the
merits
of
its
soft
ice
cream
chain.
it's
a
very
small
print.
now,
this
is
the
value
of
this
chain,
the
businessman
has
the
amicus
curiae
put
it
--
get
a
running
start
if
he
becomes
a
part
of
a
franchise
organization.
this
is
what
these
individuals
who
were
looking
forward
to
becoming
successful
businessmen
sought
when
they
became
franchise
operators.
now,
unlike
some
of
the
franchises
which
are
occurring
in
this
country,
carvel
has
envisioned
the
right
to
operate
the
soft
ice
cream
stores
which
it
wants
to
franchise
to
the
individual
operators.
and
the
expert
guidance
which
the
applicant
for
a
franchise
seeks,
not
only
on
the
payment
of
a
royalty
which
is
the
usual
and
customary
way
but
also
on
an
agreement
to
purchase
almost
all
of
its
commissary
goods
and
supplies
and
equipment
which
the
dealer
needs
in
this
everyday
operation
of
his
business.
thus,
the
applicant
has
no
choice
if
he
wants
a
carvel
franchise.
he
must
buy
frantically
all
of
his
commissary
goods
from
carvel.
now,
if
we
look
at
this
problem
in
a
broad
sense,
we
see
that
there
is
a
tying
arrangement
between
the
item
which
is
desirable,
unique
and
attractive
to
the
applicant,
the
things
that
make
for
business
success.
and
which
are
perhaps
accompanied
by
certain
things
like
the
carvel
name
and
reputation,
by
carvel's
way
of
doing
business
and
even
perhaps
by
the
appearance
of
the
carvel
stores
in
the
way
they
have
uniqueness
in
their
qualities.
now,
these
are
the
items
which
draw
the
franchiser
--
franchisee
to
carvel.
and
this
is
the
element.
this
is
the
focus
of
the
tying
arrangement.
this
interpretation
of
the
tying
arrangement
does
not
differ
very
substantially
from
the
position
taken
by
chief
justice
lumbard
in
the
second
circuit.
it
is
almost
the
same.
but,
i
think
the
emphasis
is
placed
somewhat
differently.
it
is
also
essentially
the
same
view
which
was
taken
in
a
similar
case,
not
part
of
this
proceeding
by
the
federal
trade
commission
examiner
who
heard
evidence.
in
both
cases
and
the
court
and
the
federal
trade
commission
found
a
tying
arrangement.
and
judge
lumbard
in
his
opinion
found
an
illegal
tying
arrangement.
the
concurrent
--
the
majority
opinion
of
judges
friendly
and
medina
is
actually
in
agreement
on
this
point.
i
think
the
court
as
an
entirety
finds
a
tying
arrangement.
the
only
difference
on
which
the
result
comes
out,
the
only
way
the
result
differs
is
that
the
majority
refers
to
the
fact
that
carvel
plaintiffs,
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case
below,
the
petitioners
here,
entered
into
a
stipulation
by
which
they
agreed
to
limit
themselves
to
the
per
se
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws
as
far
as
proof
was
concerned.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
actually
wasn't
as
far
as
proof
was
concerned
they
said
that
they
were
going
to
rely
on
the
per
se
violations.
it
was
evidently
their
position
that
this
court's
opinions
and
laws
and
also
in
northern
pacific
made
it
very
clear
that
this
was
one
of
the
most
pernicious
forms
of
tying
arrangements.
this
kind
of
tying
arrangement
that
--
which
we
speak
here,
your
honor,
is
not
the
kind
of
tying
arrangement
which
means
a
purchase
of
an
initial
inventory
tied
to
a
certain
values
in
the
purchase
of
franchise.
this
is
not
what
we're
referring
to.
this
is
a
tying
arrangement
for
the
commissary
goods
for
the
life
of
the
franchise.
in
doing
this,
in
tying
this,
the
commissary
goods
to
the
franchise,
for
the
entire
life
of
the
franchise,
not
only
is
the
competitive
supplier
excluded
from
the
market
of
400
carvel
dealers,
who
according
to
stipulated
figures,
buy
approximately
four
and
half
million
dollars
worth
of
goods
substantially
more
than
were
involved
in
the
international
salt
case.
and
we
feel
that
a
substantial
market
is
as
to
the
result
tied
and
controlled.
from
this,
i
think
it
can
be
concluded
that
there
is
tremendous
value
in
the
tying
item.
and
the
tying
item
as
judge
lumbard
put
it,
consists
not
only
of
the
items
which
i
feel
attract
the
ordinary
businessman
who
knows
nothing
about
patents
and
copyrights
and
trademarks
and
machines.
he
only
knows
about
this
is
an
advertised
--
this
makes
for
success
21
years
without
a
business
failure.
we
have
served
the
soft
ice
cream
industry
since
1934
succeed
with
carvel.
and
it's
almost
an
underwritten
promise
that
this
franchise
will
give
success.
this
is
an
attitude
which
i
think
overwhelms
an
applicant
and
makes
it
easy
for
him
to
acquiesce
in
this
type
of
arrangement.
and
in
an
acquiescing
in
this
kind
of
arrangement,
he
not
only
puts
himself
in
the
position
of
agreeing
to
purchase
these
commissary
goods
for
the
period
of
his
business
experience
with
carvel.
but,
he
also
puts
himself
in
the
position
where
he
must,
if
he
ever
violates
the
law
--
the
rules
set
forth
in
the
franchise
agreement.
if
he
ever
violates
by
buying
from
a
competitor,
a
national
biscuit
company
and
other
large
companies
have
very
anxiously
solicited
the
business
of
this
carvel
dealers.
if
he
ever
violates
this
rule,
he
is
in
a
position
where
he
may
be
forced
to
give
up
his
business
with
a
loss
of
a
substantial
part
of
his
investment.
in
fact,
most
of
his
investment,
depending
on
what
the
year
is
in
which
this
franchise
is
terminated.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
he
is
not
only
restricted
in
his
freedom
to
compete
in
the
marketplace
for
--
with
--
he
is
not
only
restricted
in
obtaining
price
concessions
from
suppliers,
he
is
completely
eliminated.
he
is
completely
made
a
part
of
the
carvel
organization.
true
and
this
is
judge
--
what
judge
lumbard
recognizes.
there
is
price
competition
on
the
sup
--
on
the
carvel
level.
carvel
gets
the
price
concessions
but
if
the
carvel
dealer
had
available
to
him
the
opportunity
of
dealing
with
more
than
one
supplier,
there
would
be
no
problem
because
he
too
would
get
price
concessions.
now,
if
he
violates
this
part
of
the
franchise
agreement
and
his
agreement
is
terminated,
or
if
his
franchise
is
not
renewed,
he'd
not
only
exclude
it
from
the
business
area
for
a
short
period
of
time,
he's
excluded
from
an
area
of
25
miles
for
a
period
of
five
years.
this
is
a
very,
very
severe
restriction
and
one
which
i
think
will
cause
an
owner
of
a
franchise
to
think
twice
before
he
will
violate
the
franchise
terms.
now
in
discussing
the
aspects
of
what
happens
to
the
suppliers,
we
have
not
only
to
take
into
consideration
the
suppliers
which
supply
carvel.
but,
other
suppliers
would
do
equally
well
and
will
do
equally
well
in
supplying
the
needs
of
carvel
dealers.
it
should
be
noted
that
eagle
cone
corporation
which
does
business
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
is
not
permitted
to
sell
to
carvel
dealers
the
very
same
cones
which
it
can
sell
to
connecticut
dealers,
which
it
can
sell
to
massachusetts
dealers,
because
in
pennsylvania
this
is
the
area
of
the
illinois
baking
company.
now,
for
a
practical
--
in
a
practical
sense,
i
--
the
supplier
actually
deals
with
the
dealer.
it's
only
in
the
form
in
which
the
agreement
is
cast
that
carvel
is
the
supplier
at
all,
that
dealer
gives
his
order
to
the
supplier
and
i
note
that
there
are
different
suppliers
with
different
things,
different
suppliers
with
dairy
product,
different
suppliers
for
ice
cream
cones.
he
gets
his
order
to
these
suppliers.
the
suppliers
deliver
them
to
him.
they
invoice
him
on
a
bill
which
was
prepared
and
printed
at
the
request
of
carvel
on
a
carvel
letterhead.
and
that
even
in
most
instances
collect
payments
from
the
dealer.
in
other
words,
the
dealers
are
in
effect
dealing
with
the
supplier
without
having
the
benefits
which
come
with
price
competition.
they
were
permitted
to
deal
with
the
other
suppliers
who
could
very
easily
and
are
capable
of
furnishing
these
very
same
supplies
as
indicated
by
the
fact
that
carvel
doesn't
just
deal
with
rakestraw
and
hood,
it
deals
with
a
number
of
other
dairies
in
the
large
area.
it
doesn't
just
deal
with
eagle
cone.
it
deals
with
other
suppliers
of
cones
in
other
areas.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
carvel
itself,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
no,
your
honor.
carvel
itself
manufactures
nothing
with
the
exception
perhaps
of
the
ice
cream
freezer
which
have
--
the
freezer
itself
which
is
--
which
comes
as
part
of
the
original
inventory
which
the
dealer
buys
when
he
obtains
the
franchise.
this
freezer
and
to
which
is
usually
added
to
if
the
business
expense
it
provided
for
in
the
franchise
agreement.
this
is
the
only
item
which
carvel
itself
manufactures.
carvel
does
not
manufacture
anything
else.
it
obtains
all
its
other
goods
from
other
sources
manuf
--
they're
manufactured
from
--
by
other
suppliers
or
other
manufacturers
for
carvel.
carvel
is
solely
in
the
business
of
franchising
and
selling
recipes
you
might
say,
they
license
the
use
of
the
techniques
to
the
dealer
and
they
give
the
--
they're
specific
specifications
to
the
supplier
and
ask
him
to
deliver
these
goods.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
this
is
equally
through
--
other
ice
cream
formulation.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
well
your
honor,
the
--
carvel
says
it's
a
secret
and
i
think
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
it
is
or
not.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
yes,
your
honor,
justice
lumbard
assumed
it.
the
federal
trade
commission
had
some
doubts
about
it
but
again
i
think
it
doesn't
affect
the
outcome.
car
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
well,
the
dealer
himself
when
he
is
--
when
he
buys
the
franchise,
is
not
interested
in
whether
carvel's
formula
is
a
trade
secret,
he's
interested
in
the
success
of
the
store.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
that's
right.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
no
your
honor.
the
dealer
does
not
ordinarily
know
the
secret.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
your
honor,
it
is
our
view
and
in
that
respect
the
position
of
the
reply
brief
differs
from
the
position
of
the
plaintiff's
initial
brief.
our
point
of
view
is
that
anyone
who
is
interested
in
manufacturing
carvel
ice
cream
can
very
readily
be
licensed.
carvel
has
given
specifications
to
a
number
of
dairies.
there
was
evidence
in
the
federal
trade
commission
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
that's
correct.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
and
actually
there
is
no
great
difficulty
in
manufacturing
it.
when
you
would
think
about
the
amount
of
mix
that
is
utilized
by
the
average
carvel
dealer,
judge
dawson
in
his
fraud
opinion
and
the
--
the
opinion
in
a
fraud
case
which
is
in
--
part
of
this
record
on
page
13
recognized
the
fact
that
the
average
carvel
dealer
purchases
960
ten-gallon
cans
of
mix
a
year
which
means
about
9600
gallons
a
year.
now
you
multiply
this
figure
which
the
court
accepted
by
the
average
cost,
net
cost
of
the
ice
cream
mix
which
is
about
$14
for
a
ten-gallon
can,
and
you
come
up
with
a
figure
of
about
$13,000
more
--
a
little
bit
more
perhaps
of
ice
cream
mix
that
is
sold
by
these
dairy
to
the
carvel
dealer.
if
there
are
four
or
five
carvel
dealers
available
in
any
one
area
then
it
will
justify
the
average
dairy
to
make
up
a
special
formula
mix
for
these
carvel
dealers
and
it
will
give
them
an
opportunity
of
competing
for
the
carvel
dealers'
market.
this
is
not
true
at
the
present
time.
at
this
point
the
only
dairy
which
is
permitted
to
sell
to
the
carvel
dealer
is
the
one
which
is
in
effect
acting
through
carvel
or
for
carvel.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
i
believe
at
this
time
there
are
about
four
or
five,
i
know
coons
in
baltimore
is
and
i
think
that
there
are
several
in
the
western
area
in
illinois
and
in
wisconsin,
i
believe
the
secret
formula
was
not
used.
carvel
had
a
chain
of
carvel
stores
on
--
in
that
area.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
the
major
ingredients
your
honor
that
go
into
--
you're
referring
to
the
ice
cream
formula?
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
oh,
the
major
goods
which
go
in
there
are
toppings,
flavorings
which
are
obtained
from
suppliers
like
nestle
and
in
addition
to
that,
fruit,
fresh
fruit
which
is
made
--
made
up
as
part
of
the
ice
cream.
and
these
are
by
the
way
all
utilized
by
the
dealer
in
a
raw
form.
the
dealer
in
this
case
is
the
manufacturer,
not
carvel.
in
fact
carvel
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
production
of
the
ice
cream
itself
except
its
so-called
supervisory
process.
and
i
might
note
that
in
connection
with
that
supervisory
process,
the
--
that
carvel
is
not
as
concerned
about
the
quality
of
the
ice
cream
as
it
is
about
the
use
of
unauthorized
goods,
the
use
of
unauthorized
commissary.
and
if
your
honors
will
look
at
the
exhibit,
it's
--
(inaudible)
for
a
moment.
the
exhibit
shows
the
supervisor's
plot
that
--
here
that
is
--
its
page
--
it's
r413
in
the
circuit
extract
and
it's
plaintiff's
exhibit
76.
you
can
see
on
those
little
form
which
is
entitled
carvel
store
report
products
quality
control,
that
for
the
use
of
an
unimproved
item
sold
the
dealer
may
receive
80
demerits
for
unauthorized
commissary,
the
dealer
may
get
75
demerits
for
unapproved
paper
goods,
he
may
receive
40
demerits
when
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
freezer
is
improperly
operated,
is
demerits
of
5
points,
if
the
product
separates
its
as
much
as
50
points,
but
this
is
the
only
item
which
relates
to
quality
which
has
any
substantial
portion,
a
substantial
number
of
demerits.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
the
hygienic
gas
--
i'm
sorry
your
honors.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
yes
your
honor,
it
does.
i
don't
think
the
record
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
i
think
a
very
substantial
part
of
its
initial
profit
comes
from
the
sale
of
the
freezer
and
the
equipment.
that's
in
the
initial
package
which
is
sold
which
is
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
which
is
carvel
stuff
and
which
is
sold
approximately
at
twice
the
value
of
the
market
now.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
that
point
and
i
--
perhaps
i
should
not
make
such
a
statement.
the
equipment
is
one
of
the
substantial
items
in
which
carvel
profits.
in
addition
to
that,
carvel
profits
on
every
sale
of
ice
cream
mix
because
it
has
a
25
cent
per
gallon
royalty.
now
this
royalty
is
actually
the
only
obvious
profit
to
the
purchasing
dealer,
this
is
the
only
item
that
he
is
completely
aware
of.
this
one
is
stated
in
the
carvel
franchise
agreement
and
it
says
that
for
the
licensing
of
our
name
and
for
the
permission
to
--
that
you
use
the
name,
we
are
going
to
require
you
to
pay
us
25
cents
per
gallon
of
ice
cream
mix.
now
this
is
--
in
addition
to
that,
carvel
because
it
is
the
supplier,
gets
a
profit
on
the
sale
of
ice
cream
cones
which
is
--
as
the
court
below
found
not
a
very
large
profit
in
the
individual
dealer
sense
but
is
a
very
substantial
profit
if
you
look
at
it
in
the
overall
picture.
it
also
draws
--
gets
profits
from
the
dairies
but
the
amount
of
the
profit
that
it
gets
from
the
dairies
beyond
that
is
not
really
indicated.
the
only
thing
that's
clear
is
that
the
dairies
have
a
formula
by
which
cause
or
designates
the
price
at
which
these
ice
cream
mixes
are
to
be
sold
to
carvel
dealers.
the
price
is
fixed
by
agreement
between
carvel
and
the
suppliers.
and
carvel
assures
itself
a
margin
of
profit.
the
extent
of
this
margin
of
profit
is
not
in
the
record
and
i
can't
say
exactly
how
much
it
is.
but
there
is
a
profit
and
it's
obviously
one
of
the
elements
which
make
this
tying
agreement
attractive
to
carvel.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
there
are
profits
in
the
toppings
but
again
since
the
toppings
come
through
carvel,
even
though
they
might
be
shipped
directly
by
the
manufacturer,
these
items
are
usually
shipped
by
parcel
post
rather
than
delivered
by
truck
as
cones
and
the
mixes
are.
these
items
are
--
don't
show
what
the
markup
is
and
obviously
carvel
is
in
the
position
of
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
to
the
extent
that
carvel
dealers
are
permitted
to
buy
fresh
fruit
on
their
local
markets,
they
are
of
course
not
at
all
concern
about
it.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
well,
i
think
there
are
some
kind
--
sometimes
matters
like
bananas
or
something
to
that
sort
which
carvel
at
times
permits
in
serving.
to
the
effect,
and
these
are
matters
--
these
types
of
commissary
goods
carvel
dealers
buy
in
the
local
market
without
carvel.
but
these
are
about
the
only
items
on
which
carvel
does
not
have
some
kind
of
profit.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
the
price
--
i
imagine
your
honor
refers
to
whether
or
not
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
well,
this
price
is
fairly
standardized.
the
amount
of
the
ice
cream
which
is
to
be
put
in
a
cone
is
clearly
defined
in
the
manual,
the
sop
manual
which
is
part
of
the
franchise
agreement.
and
carvel
has
made
it
very
clear
to
its
dealers
that
it
prefers
and
carvel
says
it's
suggested
but
there
is
a
question
on
that
point.
the
--
they
are
in
fact
required
to
sell
their
ice
cream
cones
for
10
and
20
cones
--
20
cents.
there
is
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
(inaudible)
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
well,
your
honor,
on
this
point
and
this
is
a
point
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
agree
with
the
position
of
the
petitioners.
on
this
particular
point
the
carvel
dealer
is
advised
informally
through
recommendations
of
the
supervisors
and
through
the
board
of
governors
of
the
dealers
association,
what
is
proper
and
what
is
improper.
and
the
price
fixing
angle
is
one
of
moral
suasion
which
is
contradicted
by
self
serving
decorations
of
carvel
in
the
record
to
which
carvel
will
tell
you
that
you
are
not
required
to
follow
our
recommendations.
in
fact,
i
think
there
is
a
cushion
of
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
modick
(ph)
in
the
record,
who
in
the
presence
of
a
supervisor
build
a
huge
ice
cream
cone.
and
carvel
defendants
try
to
point
out,
well,
if
this
is
possible,
you
can
violate
these
rules,
then
isn't
it
true
that
you
are
not
required
to
follow
these
recommendations.
and
the
dealer
answered
at
that
point
and
now
i'm
paraphrasing
with
the
(inaudible)
but
the
--
he
says,
?well,
i
was
very
severely
censored
and
criticize
for
what
i
did.?
and
this
is
essentially
the
type
of
arrangement
that
exist
in
that
regard.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
no,
your
honor,
i
would
disagree
with
that
and
i
must
in
that
regard
disagree
with
the
court.
the
tying
item,
the
focus
of
the
tying
of
a
tool
is
the
--
the
part
of
the
arrangement
which
makes
this
desire.
the
trade
name
is
part
of
that.
the
expert
guidance
which
the
dealer
seeks
is
part
of
it.
the
recipe
is
a
part
of
it.
the
machinery
on
the
other
hand,
the
freezers
i
would
say
are
secondary,
i'd
say
these
are
tied
items.
even
though
they're
patented
or
at
least
they
contain
some
patented
items
and
they
are
perhaps
trademark
and
have
trademark
labels
on
it.
i
don't
think
that
they
are
the
focus
of
this
tying
arrangement.
the
focus
of
the
tying
arrangement
is
the
element
which
makes
this
whole
franchise
desirable
and
attractive,
unique
and
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
yes,
and
the
other
elements
which
make
for
successes
like
the
uniformity
perhaps
of
the
appearance
of
the
building,
the
cone
design
on
the
outside
of
the
building,
the
sort
of
thing
which
gives
the
customer
who
has
been
there
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
--
an
opportunity
to
identify.
this
is
why
the
trade
mark
is
part
of
the
focus
of
the
tying
arrangement.
but
on
the
other
hand
i
would
say
the
machinery
is
an
insignificant
one.
they
are
equally
good
ones
but
not
superior
ones
on
the
market.
and
the
--
well,
not
for
the
fact
that
you
couldn't
get
a
franchise
without
buying
the
machinery,
i
think
there'd
be
many
dealers
who
would
be
very
happy
to
buy
the
equipment
elsewhere
but
they
could
not
get
this
franchise
except
as
part
of
this
package.
and
continuing
this
point
which
your
honor
just
made,
i
think
it
follows
that
these
unique
qualities
as
they
were
called
in
the
lowest
case
and
these
unique
qualities
as
they
were
called-in
in
northern
pacific
are
the
things
which
exert
the
market
power
which
bring
about
the
dominance
of
the
tying
item.
this
is
why
we
take
the
position
that
this
unlike
any
of
the
other
cases
that
might
have
been
considered
under
loew's
and
northern
pacific
goes
much
further
than
the
tying
arrangements
considered
in
those
cases.
it's
much
more
pernicious
because
here
isn't
a
problem
of
extraction.
you
can't
--
you
--
no
dealer
who
has
once
signed
this
franchise
agreement
can
just
drop
the
franchise
name
can't
just
say,
?take
away
your
cargo
--
trade
name,
i
want
to
be
an
independent
dealer.
i
don't
want
to
buy
from
you
anymore.?
they
can't
say
that
because
in
order
to
terminate
your
relationship
with
carvel
you've
got
to
give
up
your
store
and
you've
got
to
go
out
of
business
for
five
years
and
out
for
an
area
of
25
miles.
you
cannot
continue
in
the
soft
ice
cream
business
if
you
surrender
your
carvel
franchise
and
that's
an
addition
to
the
economic
losses
with
yourself.
this
is
why
i
think
if
you
take
away
the
trademark
question
and
i
recalled
that
judge
lumbard
in
his
opinion
put
it
very
well,
the
issue
in
a
threshold
question
he
says
is,
?whether
the
carvel
franchise
embodies
the
tying
agreement
and
whether
that
arrangement
is
justified.?
and
the
only
justification
in
which
he
seems
to
recognize
as
a
possibilitylooking
at
the
exception
in
the
white
motor
case
referring
to
standard
stations
is
the
possibility
that
carvel
might
give
specifications
to
other
supplies
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
he
suggests
that
the
case
be
remanded.
it
is
our
view
and
in
that
regard,
perhaps
i'm
very
bold
because
i
disagree
with
the
judge
who
was
most
closely
to
our
position
below.
it
is
our
view
that
this
is
a
per
se
violation
and
that
it
is
one
in
the
most
pernicious
sense.
this
--
if
we
take
away
the
trademark
is
northern
pacific.
you
take
the
lease
of
this
store,
assume
all
the
know-how
in
the
tying
arrangement,
assume
that
expert
guidance,
assume
perhaps
even
the
individuality
of
the
store
but
not
the
trademark,
you
have
a
very,
very
simple
case
of
leasing
a
store
with
a
tying
of
the
commissary
goods.
and
it's
exactly
the
same
way
except
for
one
thing,
in
northern
pacific
the
lessee
had
an
opportunity
of
dealing
with
the
competition.
in
carvel's
franchise
he
does
not.
in
carvel's
franchise
he
is
completely
tied.
in
northern
pacific,
if
a
competitor
came
along
and
said
?i
offer
you
a
better
rate,?
the
lessor
had
agreed
that
the
lessee
might
use
this
other
carrier
who
will
ship
this.
so
even
though
the
market
was
substantially
closed,
it
wasn't
completely
closed.
here,
the
market
is
completely
closed
and
this
is
why
this
case
is
of
such
importance
not
only
to
the
petitioners
here
but
to
the
franchise
industry
as
such.
franchising
has
become
a
very,
very
important
part
of
this
nation's
economy.
we
are
not
against
franchising.
we
are
for
franchising.
franchising
gives
the
little
men
an
opportunity
of
investing
his
money
and
being
on
his
own.
it
gives
a
small
perhaps
growing
concern
an
opportunity
of
utilizing
the
capital
of
these
individuals
and
gives
them
an
opportunity
of
becoming
in
--
free
independent
businessmen.
and
in
that
context,
franchise
means
freedom
and
this
is
the
original
meaning
of
the
word
anyway.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
your
honor
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
i
think
that
there
are
some
obviously
which
do.
i
can't
say
that
it
is
a
general
rule
but
i'm
convinced
that
the
franchise
industry
does
not
need
illegal
tying
arrangements
in
order
to
grow
and
survive.
i
think
it's
an
unnecessary
thing
and
i
don't
think
that
this
kind
of
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
are
to
be
justified.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
well,
i
would
say
this
your
honor.
the
stronger
ones
are
obviously
those
which
are
not
identified
with
a
trade
secret.
but
it
is
my
view
your
honor,
that
the
trade
secret
in
this
instance
is
camouflaged,
it's
not
a
real
issue.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
price
fixing
charge
is
sufficiently
controversial
that
it
isn't
--
is
the
main
issue
in
the
case.
we
are
pressing
it
but
we
don't
make
a
major
issue
on
it.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
yes
your
honor
we
are,
but
we
are
looking
at
it
somewhat
differently
from
the
way
it's
stated
in
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
not
quite
your
honor.
what
i
would
suggest
would
be
the
profiting,
would
be
this,
carvel
may
continue
the
supply
the
dealers
but
i
think
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
--
and
still
make
a
profit.
but
it
shall
be
an
open
competition
with
the
supplier
if
he
wants
to
deal
directly,
and
it
shall
be
an
open
competition
with
other
licensed
dairies.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
are
you
referring
to
the
franchise?
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
oh,
your
honor,
they
would
of
course
be
compensated
by
the
dealer,
by
the
dairy
which
is
licensed
for
any
expense
that
might
be
incurred
in
supervision
and
in
making
sure
that
the
dairy
complied
with
carvel's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
i
don't
think
that
it's
necessary
for
carvel
to
make
a
profit
in
that
regard.
on
the
other
hand
if
it
had
a
tremendous
purchasing
power
on
that
level
it
might
still
come
to
make
a
profit
in
competing
with
the
other
dairies
into
--
in
dealing
directly
with
the
dealers
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
i'm
not
cutting
carvel
out
in
the
supply.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
definitely,
he
does.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
a
very
substantial
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
i'm
not
against
profit
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
it
isn't
that
i'm
against
the
profit.
i'm
only
saying
that
carvel
should
earn
its
profit
in
a
competitive
market.
i'm
saying
that
if
it
licenses
other
dairies,
it
may
impose
on
these
dairies
in
licensing
certain
expenses,
but
to
the
extent
that
these
dairies
in
selling
to
carvel
charge
carvel
a
lower
price
perhaps.
carvel
may
be
in
a
position
to
compete
in
dealing
directly
and
carvel
is
getting
a
profit,
this
is
the
important
thing.
carvel's
profit
lies
in
the
royalties
which
are
collected
on
every
gallon
of
mix
which
is
a
substantial
royalty
as
we
point
out
in
the
brief,
i
believe
the
figured
that
we
calculated,
this
mix
is
a
$450,000.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
in
new
york
state
the
figures
are
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
--
20%
of
the
soft
ice
cream
business
as
shown
by
the
exhibits
which
carvel
defendants
introduced
in
the
case
below.
and
in
exhibit
10,
now
there,
carvel
respondents
and
we
differ.carvel
respondents
insist
that
they
are
not
in
the
soft
ice
cream
business.
judge
lumbard,
i
think
judge
dawson,
everyone
has
conceded
that
this
is
a
soft
ice
cream
business,
the
federal
trade
commission
has
recognized
that
carvel
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
car
--
the
federal
trade
commission
found
that
in
the
new
york
area
it
was
about
37%
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
--
of
the
immediate
new
york
city
area.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
yes,
(inaudible)
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
in
all
over
the
state
the
figure
would
be
about
20%
according
to
the
department
of
agriculture
figures.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
i
don't
know
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
i
don't
know
how
many
there
are.
there
are
many
soft
ice
cream
producers
but
carvel
is
certainly
one
of
the
stronger
chains
in
the
eastern
sea
border.
the
400
soft
ice
cream
stores
under
one
name
is
a
very
substantial
group.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
the
total
ice
cream
business,
there
are
--
there
is
no
breakdown.
carvel
actually
does
not
sell
ice
cream
at
all,
it
sales
ice
cream
mix.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
the
carvel
stores
have
a
volume
according
to
stipulated
figures
of
about
six
to
eight
million,
that's
the
retail
sale.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
now,
that
does
not
just
include
ice
cream
that
includes
the
whole
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
actually
what
it
is
as
far
as
carvel
is
concerned,
carvel
sales
a
soft
ice
cream
mix
which
it
manufactures
and
changes
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
--
and
utilizes
into
making
hard
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
--
products.
these
products
are
not
edible
at
the
temperature
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
i'm
sorry.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
there
are
no
figures
your
honor
for
that
--
in
that
point.
the
only
figures
that
we
really
have
which
are
significant
which
gives
us
some
inkling
of
this
percentage
are
the
figures
on
soft
ice
cream
mix
and
carvel's
percentage
of
the
market
in
soft
ice
cream
mix.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
well,
the
product
is
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
your
honor
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
it's
a
product.
i
believe
it's
--
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
i'm
not
certain
if
this
case
belongs
under
section
3,
it
may,
may
not.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
but
in
our
view,
if
the
tying
item
is
the
franchise
together
with
this
--
the
package
of
know-how,
of
guidance
and
supervision
of
many
of
these
intangibles.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
in
the
tying
item
i
would
say
perhaps
that
is
true.
in
the
tying
item
the
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
no
your
honor
but
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
well
your
honor,
i
believe
that
you
can
assume
the
power
of
the
tying
item
from
a
market,
from
the
power
in
the
tying
product.
i
think
there
is
a
significant
value
in
the
tied
product.
i
--
there's
a
significant
market
in
the
tied
product
which
is
foreclosed
and
that
it
--
that
the
market
on
the
dealer
level
is
foreclosed
and
the
market
on
the
supplier
levels
are
foreclosed.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
i
believe
that
the
evidence
on
judge
lumbard's
analysis
seems
to
point
in
the
same
direction.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
well,
your
honor,
he
uses
the
mark,
i
don't
discard
the
mark.
i'm
only
saying
that
if
we
discard
the
mark
we
have
a
straight
northern
pacific
case.
i'm
not
saying
that
the
mark
has
no
leverage.
i
think
the
mark
and
the
trade
name
is
part
of
the
tying
item
but
i
don't
think
it's
the
only
significant
part.
i
think
it's
probably
one
of
the
elements
which
brought
the
dealer,
the
perspective
dealer
to
carvel
without
differentiation
as
chamberlain
put
it
with
regard
to
trademark.
there
is
no
identification
for
the
consumer.
and
i
believe
your
honor
as
i've
referred
to
chamberlain
in
a
number
of
opinions,
he
takes
the
position
that
the
trademark
is
a
very
significant
statutory
monopoly
which
are
to
be
considered
on
the
same
level,
if
not
on
greater
market
power
level
and
patents
and
copyrights.
now,
i'm
only
bringing
that
in
as
a
side
mark
but
that
it
is
obviously
one
of
the
elements
of
the
tying
item.
the
focus
of
the
tying
item
is
the
franchise
which
collects
all
these
various
items,
the
know-how,
the
guidance,
the
recipes,
the
trade
name,
the
attractiveness,
the
experience
of
21
years
without
failure,
all
these
things
are
tied
in
and
made
into
a
bundle
and
these
are
the
items
which
carry
the
weight.
this
is
the
focus
of
the
franchising
business.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
well,
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
that
they
have
no
interest
in
the
end
product.
but
i
am
saying
this
that
their
own
practices
in
the
enforcement
indicate
that
their
greatest
interest
is
towards
unauthorized
products
which
are
perfectly
compatible
with
the
ice
cream
business.
i
can't
see
how,
for
instance
coca-cola
which
is
a
nationally
known
trademark
could
possibly
adversely
affect
the
carvel
trade
name.
and
the
soul
reason
why
carvel
objects
to
letting
the
dealer
sell
coke
--
coca-cola,
pepsi
cola,
any
of
these
national
trade
marks,
because
they
know
that
in
permitting
them
to
do
that,
they're
depriving
themselves
of
potential
profit
in
the
tied
items.
if
a
man
comes
in
and
buys
a
coca-cola
instead
of
a
carvel
ice
cream
shake,
then
carvel
will
not
get
any
royalty
on
that
coca-cola
and
it
has
no
real
reason
for
tying
that
coca-cola
into
its
franchise
arrangement.
this
is
why
these
products
are
not
authorized.
it's
of
necessary
ancillary
part
of
this
illegal
tie.
carvel
authorized
carvel
cola,
carvel
root
beer,
only
after
it
had
been
pressured
for
years
in
--
by
carvel
dealers,
who
had
illegally
sometimes
installed
coca-cola
machines
and
had
been
forced
to
remove
them.
you'll
find
letters
in
the
record
which
re
--
direct
carvel
dealers
to
remove
their
coca-cola
machines.
and
to
these
--
these
are
the
reasons
why
they
forced
them
to
remove
them.
when
carvel
decided
that
it
wanted
to
install
carvel
cola
and
carvel
root
beer,
they
made
the
dealer
buy
the
equipment
form
carvel,
they
made
them
sign
a
supplement
to
the
franchise
and
they
made
them
pay
a
royalty
on
the
use
of
it.
and
since
they
supply
the
syrup,
they
made
a
profit
on
it
and
basically
carvel
root
beer
is
richardson's
root
beer
and
there
isn't
any
differences
between
richardson's
root
beer
and
carvel
root
beer
and
yet
richardson
cannot
sell
root
beer
to
carvel
stores
and
it
could
not
before
the
arrangement
was
made.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
i
would
say
this
your
honor,
that
under
the
circumstances
carvel
must
be
selling
at
competitive
prices
and
i
don't
think
that
this
would
be
the
case.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
well
your
honor,
the
leverage
is
determinations
of
franchise.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
oh,
the
franchise
is
worth
a
great
deal.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
if
they
don't
have
it
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
well,
carvel
is
being
paid
for
the
franchise
and
it
is
getting
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
it
is
getting
royalty.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
that
is
probably
true
and
perhaps
they
are
entitled
to
charge
more
than
the
initial
--
initially
when
they
license
somebody
but
they
are
getting
profits.
as
matter
of
fact
they
even
get
profits
on
the
leases
of
the
stores.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
in
many
occasions
they
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
--
there's
a
differential
there.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
no
your
honor.
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
actual
lease,
ordinarily
carvel
leases
a
store
to
the
carvel
dealer.
the
rental
itself
is
in
many
instances
inflated
by
a
considerable
sum.
so
that
for
instance
the
carvel,
they
may
take
$150
or
$200
to
the
landlord
from
which
the
property
is
leased
and
it
will
charge
the
dealer
$300,
$200,
but
there's
a
--
an
item
in
there.
and
these
differ
from
store
to
store.
and
where
the
carvel
dealer
has
actually
own
the
land
in
which
the
store
is
built,
carvel
insists
on
a
conditional
reassignment.
they
would
--
they
want
an
--
to
be
in
a
position
of
being
a
lessor
so
that
they
can
takeover
the
business
when
the
franchise
is
terminated.
in
other
words,
not
only
will
a
violation
to
the
franchise
can
cause
the
loss
of
--
the
right
of
the
dealer
to
do
business
under
carvel
name,
it
will
cause
them
to
lose
the
entire
business
and
it
cause
them
to
be
excluded
completely
from
a
25-mile
area
in
the
soft
ice
cream
business
for
a
period
of
five
years,
these
are
very
substantial
remedies
that
carvel
has.
now,
i
would
like
to
just
for
a
moment
touch
on
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
well,
your
honor,
they
aren't.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
well
your
honor,
if
they
were
quality
arrangements,
it
would
perhaps
be
a
little
different
but
under
the
context
of
this
case,
they
are
not.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
well.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
well,
your
honor,
if
you
will
look
at
the
commissary
goods
by
themselves,
they
do
bear
a
semblance
to
a
supply
--
an
exclusive
dealing
or
requirements
contract.
however,
if
you
take
these
commissary
goods
and
you
tie
them
in
with
the
franchise,
and
the
power
of
carvel
to
terminate
the
dealer,
to
throw
them
off
the
land,
to
confiscate
its
machinery,
to
eliminate
him
from
the
business
then
i
think
you
have
as
pernicious
a
situation
as
you
had
in
northern
pacific.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
your
honor
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
your
honor
i
believe
the
entire
court
finds
that
there
is
a
tying
arrangement.
perhaps
the
definition
of
the
tying
arrangement
of
judges
lumbard
differs
from
that
of
judges
friendly
and
medina.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
judge
lumbard
specifically
says
that
there
is
a
per
se
violation.
the
only
argument
which
he
leaves
open
is
the
argument
which
respondents
make
that
there
is
a
little
opening
left
as
a
result
of
the
standard
stations
case.
and
this
little
opening
says
that
if
in
order
to
safeguard
the
trade
name,
the
reputation
of
the
name,
it
is
necessary
to
tie
then
if
it
is
impossible
to
furnish
specifications
but
it's
impractical
to
furnish
specifications
then
under
those
circumstances
it
is
possible
that
it
might
be
justified.
but
this
court
except
for
the
dicta
in
the
standard
stations
case
has
never
held
a
per
--
held
that
a
per
se
violation,
a
tying
arrangement
could
be
justified.
i
think
that
the
best
that
we
can
say
is
that
there
are
some
circumstances
in
beginning
industry
like
in
the
jerrold's
case
or
in
situation
of
that
kind
that
there
maybe
the
possibility
for
it.
but
here,
we
have
a
situation
which
by
the
very
fact
that
carvel
was
able
to
supply
specifications
to
rakestraw
and
to
eagle
and
to
hood,
and
to
illinois
baking
company,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
cones
are
standard
items
in
the
market,
they're
not
specifically
carvel
cones
even
though
carvel
like
to
call
them
that.
these
items
can
be
specified,
all
these
items
can
be
specified
and
if
there
are
special
secret
formulas
involved
the
proposed
supplier
who
is
interested
by
national
biscuit
company
which
requested
the
right
to
supply
carvel
dealers.
and
which
was
faced
with
a
letter
(inaudible)
with
litigation.
if
these
suppliers
wanted
to
serve
carvel,
they
can
ask
for
the
specification
and
then
be
permitted
to
deal
with
the
dealers
directly.
and
if
there
is
any
supervision
on
the
part
of
carvel
involved
and
perhaps
there
is,
slightly
greater
problem
of
supervision
then
this
problem
of
supervision
i
think
can
be
readily
resolved.
there
are
many
reputable
manufacturers
in
the
field
and
this
is
why
we
feel
that
the
supplier
defendants
a
part
of
this
case
your
honor.
carvel
is
not
manufacturing
its
own
right.
without
the
defendants,
without
the
supplier
defendants
there
would
be
no
tying
arrangement.
their
agreements
with
the
supplier
defendants
are
--
were
made
knowing
that
the
suppliers
would
supply
this
market
of
400
dealers.
and
they
were
made
by
the
suppliers
in
order
to
make
it
possible
for
carvel
to
enforce
its
conduit.
it
may
--
it
may
be
that
they
claim
no
knowledge
of
these
things
but
i
think
the
affidavit
of
mr.
kane
who
speaks
of
the
fierce
competition
of
cone
industry
and
the
uniqueness
of
the
stable
market
that
exist
by
reason
of
carvel's
agreement
with
eagle
cone
is
a
clear
indication
of
that.
i
think
it's
on
page
115
of
the
record.
now,
i
would
very
much
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
part
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
(inaudible)
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
yes.
may
it
please
--
mr.
arnold
fleischmann
thank
you
your
honors.
