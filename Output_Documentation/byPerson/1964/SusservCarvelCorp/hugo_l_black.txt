(inaudible)
justice

black
i'm
asking
you
now,
what's
protected
by
the
trademark?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
everything
that
goes
into
it,
what
about

justice

why
would
sugar
not
to

you
don't
put
sugar
in?
justice

do
you
sweeten
it?
justice

black
(inaudible)
what
is
the
scope
protected
by

black
suppose
they
sold
something?
every
one
of
your
products
in
it,
every
products
in
it,
sort
of
the
--
where
you
use
it
and
did
you
name
it?
all
of
it
wasn't
bought
from
you
but
they
didn't
name
it
lollapalooza,
would
that
violate
the
trade
right?
justice

black
like
a
howard
johnson
as
i
understand
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
mean
looks
like
it.
i
mean
it's
the
same
idea.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
but
that
i
--
if
they
have
an
identity,
it's
identified
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
by
looking
at
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
question
is,
what
--
how
far
does
your
protection
--
it
can
on
your
trademark?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
carvel
items,
this
mean
that
he
has
to
buy
from
carvel
or
a
carvel
salesman
all
--
everything
that
he
sells
in
the
store?
justice

if
he
--
if
--
you
said
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
couldn't
sell
coca-cola
inside
the
store
but
could
outside?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
provided
the
way
--
is
that
what
you
referred
us
to
on
page
16,
is
that
what
protects
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
they
had
something
into
that
--
sort
of
that
broom.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
that
mean
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
carvel
broom?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
sell
some
brooms
in
there
that
were
not
carvel
broom?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
can't
sell
brooms?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
had
thought
you
meant
a
while
ago.
its
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
finally
clear.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
facts
that
--
what
--
do
you
understand
would
be
meant
fully
by
publication
of
the

with
the
formula
patenting?
justice
hugo

black
has
the
formula
of
patenting?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
total
requirement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
show
what
is
a
minimum
product
that
can
be
broken
up
--
down
to
--
minimum
products
broken
down
to
which
would
preserve
your
secret
formula
and
leave
you
with
the
right
to
sell
it
only?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
a
part
of
your
argument
that
the
secret
formula
will
only
be
protected
by
the
use
of
all
of
your
ingredients?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
the
second
part
of
your
argument.
justice
hugo

black
but
having
no
patents
of
course.
justice

the

i
can't

it

maybe
it's

clear
in
my
mind,
your
certain

go
in,
you
want
to
protect
the
secret

is
there

has
their
finding
under

your

i
understand
that's
the

that's
what
the
basis
you're

arguing.

you
claim
you
have
a

anything
else?

what
are
the

goods?
justice

as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
say
he
can't
sell
them
in
there,
do
you
not?
justice

black
oh,
you
couldn't
--
he
couldn't
use
your

are
you

you're
saying
by
that
are
you
that
maybe
its
right
since
you
own
that
building.
justice

black
you
--
well
whatever
it
is,
he
gets
it,
the
right
to
use
it
from
you

you
got
a
right
to
tell
him
everything
he
can
put
in
there
and
everything
he
can
sell,
and
everybody
from
whom
he
could
buy.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice

now
when
he
does
that
and
(voice

--
justice

when
he
does
that
and
pays
for
it,
puts
up
the
type
of
building
that
has
--
justice

black
--
has
it,
pays
for
it,
what
rights
do
you
have
then
to
control
the
rest
of
his
business
activities?
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
you
say
that
so
far
as
tying
is
concerned,
the
right
to
buy
other
things
and
so
forth,
you
have
a
legal
right
to
do
it.
as
i
--
i
don't
understand
why
you
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
there's
no
tying.
of
course,
they
get
tying
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
would
be
tying
if
i
don't
have
a
building
and
you
say
i
won't
rent
it
to
you.
i
want
to
tie
to
it
in
agreement
and
you've
got
to
buy
certain
products
from
certain
people
at
certain
prices
and
be
tied.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
a
franchise?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
seems
to
me
--
that's
begging
the
question
as
i
see
it.
but
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know
whether
you're
right
or
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
--
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
tie.
you
have
tied
to
his
--
purchase
of
that
franchise,
tied
him
down
to
buy
products
of
a
certain
kind,
from
a
certain
branch
and
maybe
you're
right
into
--
maybe
have
rights
but
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
use
the
word
reasonable,
i
meant
the
word
tie.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
franchise,
if
it's
a
valuable
franchise,
he
didn't
want
it
taken
away
from
him
and
he's
agreed
to
do
certain
things
and
buy
goods
from
somebody,
that's
what
i
told
tie.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
that
is
a
common
word
--
the
sense
of
the
word.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
think
--
i'm
thinking,
i
think
we
just
used
--
moved
away
from
a
word
that
i
think
fits
what
you're
doing,
you
don't
think
it
fits
you.
but
the
question
in
my
mind
is
whether
when
that
is
done,
it
violates
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
to
do
it.
justice
hugo

then
you
make
the

cream
there?
