isn't
that
a
secret
of
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
isn't
that
rather
an
important
contribution
in
addition
to
the
original
inventory,
this
is
a
continuing
contribution
isn't
it
that
carvel
make?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,

just
wondering,
can
he
sell
--
as
i
understand
it
that
formula
is
given
to
the
dairy
suppliers,
they
make
the
mix
don't
they
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
the
dealer
then
buy?
the
dealer
i
take
it
doesn't
know
the
secret,
doesn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
--
if
the
tie
in
with
the
dairy
--
violative
of
the
antitrust
laws,
where
does
he
go
out
and
buy
this
formula?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
answer
is
that
carvel
could
license
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
then
any
supplier
that
the
dealer
wants
to
buy
from

it?
