mr.
herman
l.
weisman
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
spend
a
few
minutes
getting
the
basic
facts
into
focus.
all
arguments
on
behalf
of
carvel
that
petitioners
had
failed
to
show
any
error
and
have
ignored
the
substantial
evidence
in
support
of
the
concurrent
findings
below
depends
on
a
--
on
an
accurate
statement
of
the
restrictions
that
are
complained
of
and
an
analysis
of
this
scope
and
their
operation.
now
this
is
our
brief
on
pages
15
and
16,
the
main
one
prints
the
principal
restrictions.
the
first
one
of
course
is
from
the
position
of
the
dealer
as
a
seller.
he
is
required
to
sell
only
carvel
items
in
the
franchise
store
and
a
unanimous
court
below
has
not
found
fault
with
that
part
of
the
restriction.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
on
page
15
(inaudible)
--
at
the
bottom.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
i'm
referring
to
paragraph
4
of
our
brief.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
now,
if
your
honor
will
turn
the
page,
you
would
see
paragraph
6
which
is
the
principle
restriction
and
the
restriction
is
not
to
the
entire
commissary
that
a
store
might
need.
there
are
500
items
in
the
exhibit
that
go
into
the
so-called
commissary
department
but
there
are
only
70
from
among
which
the
dealer
depending
on
what
he
wants
to
make
and
sell
in
his
store
and
select
the
component
ingredients
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
--
on
page
16
your
honor.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
well,
they
maybe
brooms,
pales,
paint,
other
garnishments
that
don't
go
into
the
final
product
because
the
restriction
i'm
about
to
point
out
is
limited
as
the
courts
below
found
to
the
mix
and
every
other
items
sold
as
part
of
the
end
product
that
is
offered
for
consumption
to
the
public
under
the
carvel
name.
and
that
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
page
16,
it's
this
quotation
from
the
franchise
that
i'm
calling
your
attention
to,
the
actual
provisions
sir.
now,
so
that
the
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
well,
the
component
parts,
the
principle
one
as
to
which
the
court
found
that
two-thirds
of
the
entire
sales
embrace
it
is
a
product
called
ice
cream
mix
which
is
a
blend
product
that's
put
into
a
machine
by
the
dealer
who
has
to
have
a
license
to
fabricate
it
into
a
finish
product.
but
while
he
does
that,
he
adds
flavor.
carvel
could
sell
him
a
flavored
mix
but
then
he
have
to
have
an
inventory.
he'd
be
worse
off
so
that
they
sell
the
flavor
as
an
essential
ingredient,
some
areas
would
prefer
a
run
of
chocolate
and
now
there's
cherry.
so
they
sell
them
the
essential
ingredients
consisting
of
the
flavors,
the
toppings
and
the
baked
goods,
sometimes
their
cones,
sometimes
their
cups
and
the
evidences
that
the
flavor
is
arranged
by
specifications
to
be
compatible.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
it
could
be
but
the
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
the
flavorings
are
made
but
the
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
the
flavorings
are
made
to
specifications
of
carvel
on
the
contracts
similar
to
the
ones
printed
in
the
record.
by
and
large
one
would
think
that
flavorings
are
on
the
general
commodity
market.
however,
there
is
an
element
of
compatibility
as
the
court
points
out
with
regards
to
the
strawberries
where
carvel
specified
that
they
buy
a
crop
site
because
they
have
stringent
requirements.
now,
nobody
going
into
business
has
to
go
after
a
high
quality
product.
most
of
the
time
we
--
specially
improved
products,
we
run
into
common
places,
standards
about
food.
this
chain
happens
to
insist
on
high
quality.
there
is
no
doubt
at
any
point
of
the
proceeding
of
the
confirmation
of
the
high
quality
nature
of
these
carvel
products
and
their
protection
constantly
by
the
most
detailed
provisions
in
evidence
here,
with
the
supply
contractors,
the
dairies.
the
dairies,
you
can
--
there
are
222
million
gallons
of
ice
cream
mix
made
a
year,
and
from
that
you
can
judge
that
there
are
thousands
of
suppliers
of
dairy
products.
and
you
just
can't
begin
to
protect
a
trade
secret
by
releasing
them
on
the
market
something
to
which
will
come
through
in
another
connection.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
well,
i
won't
say
that
--
a
lot
of
things
can
be
equal.
the
question
is
not
whether
it's
better
of
worst.
it's
a
question
of
what
goes
with
the
mix
and
what
the
consumer
can
recognize
as
a
carvel
product.
it
doesn't
necessarily
always
have
to
be
better
in
my
opinion
because
if
it's
not
better
in
my
opinion
i
will
go
to
dairy
freeze
instead
of
carvel,
or
mr.
softy,
or
mr.
tastee
freez,
all
these
competitive
franchising
organizations
which
are
mentioned
by
judge
friendly
in
his
opinion
as
the
real
competitors
of
carvel.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
the
mixes
are
blend
mixture
which
however,
in
the
case
of
this
product
functions
for
a
dual
purpose
and
there's
ample
evidence
here
that
it
functions
not
as
a
soft
ice
cream
mix.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
specifications
in
the
federal
register
of
standards
for
mix,
it's
a
--
this
is
governed
by
statute
and
regulations.
it's
a
highly
perishable
product.
they
don't
define
soft
ice
cream
mix.
there's
no
such
thing,
there
is
an
ice
cream
mix.
now
in
that
ice
cream
mix,
depending
on
what
you
want
to
get
in
the
end
product
by
way
of
it's
ability,
its
durability,
its
ability
to
stand
up,
it's
eye
appeal,
it's
a
--
when
you
eat
it
and
they
buy
it
in
the
summertime,
if
it
melts
before
you
get
it
to
the
car
it's
not
a
very
pleasant
thing.
this
is
controlled
by
an
emulsifier
stabilizer.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
sir?
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
the
only
thing
that
the
dairies
even
do
not
know
about
is
the
secret
emulsifier
stabilizer
which
carvel
supplies
and
this
is
itself
the
product
of
a
formula
to
the
dairies.
the
dairies
then
use
the
secret
formula
stabilizer
and
make
it
--
make
the
rest
of
the
mix
in
accordance
with
the
other
specifications
in
the
carvel
formula,
the
nature
of
which
i
don't
know
and
have
not
been
disclosed
in
this
case.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
oh,
you
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
yes,
you
get
a
strawberry
ice
cream
but
if
you're
a
carvel
dealer
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
you're
a
carvel
dealers.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
yes.
and
you
need
a
license
for
that
because
it
comes
out
off
a
machine
and
the
local
laws
continue
--
would
continue
you
--
would
consider
you
a
--
what
they
call
a
manufacturer
retailer
with
a
license.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
there
are
some
patented
devices
but
the
adverse
of
the
clause
that
i
pointed
to
on
page
16,
is
in
a
later
clause,
paragraph
9
of
the
franchise
agreement
which
says
that
matters
that
are
not
incorporated
in
the
end
product
can
be
bought
if
they
meet
carvel
specification.
so
that
if
the
need
arises
that
the
business
is
good,
it
expands
and
you
need
another
freezer,
you
don't
have
to
go
to
carvel
for
the
freezer,
that's
not
incorporated
in
the
end
product.
you've
got
to
buy
a
freezer
that
will
have
the
capacity
and
meet
the
standards.
now
the
original
brief
says
that
--
that's
very
nice
but
carvel
didn't
happen
to
supply
the
standards.
that
was
mistaken
because
there
is
an
exhibit
brought
to
the
court,
the
section
m
of
exhibit
8a
which
continues
page
after
page
to
give
detailed
specifications
not
only
of
the
equipment
but
of
everything
and
including
such
things
as
the
description
of
the
kind
of
a
label
that
you
use
which
may
not
strike
anybody
as
something
requiring
specifications.
but
if
you
maintain
the
cleanliness
of
a
place
that
sales
perishable
commodities
and
you
buy
a
label
that's
wrong,
you're
going
to
lose
some
money
by
spilling
your
product
or
not
handling
it
properly
so
that
you
augment
your
cleaning
operations
and
so
on.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
we
--
yes
--
(inaudible)
no,
it
never
sold
except
to
a
carvel
--
someone
who
goes
into
the
carvel
business
and
as
i
say,
initially,
i
suppose
most
everybody
buys
from
carvel
the
machine
with
which
to
start
the
business.
but
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
(inaudible)
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
--
the
swirling
mechanism
in
it
is
a
patent.
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
yes,
carvel
licensed
--
mr.
carvel
owns
it
and
the
carvel
companies
are
the
licensees
of
it.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
no,
that's
not
so
specified,
no.
i
think
they
--
if
they
have
several
freezers
it
would
be
most
unlikely
if
they
didn't
have
at
least
one
but
the
court
below
points
out
that
the
patented
machine
or
indeed
none
of
the
equipment
is
the
--
what
he
calls
the
unifying
clause
or
motivating
clause
for
the
transaction.
now
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
mix
--
the
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
--
mix
flavors
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
oh,
the
trademark.
you
asked
me
before
what
went
into
the
end
product.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
the
ice
cream
made
by
the
use
of
the
carvel
components.
all
the
products
which
are
both
hard
and
soft,
specialty
items
which
are
sold
as
hard
items
and
soft
ice
cream,
all
the
end
products
are
sold
under
the
carvel
trademark.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
no.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
nobody
puts
sugar
into
it.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
no,
i
mean
sugar
and
such
is
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
its
part
of
the
formula
for
the
making
of
mix
and
it
may
be
cold
or
it
may
be
--
these
are
all
fresh
product
ingredients.
but
it's
the
dairy
that
puts
in
whatever
sweetener
is
used
in
accordance
with
the
formula.
there
is
no
trademark
on
the
sweetener.
there
is
no
trademark
even
on
the
stabilizer
that
i
discovered
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
the
scope
of
the
trademark
is
the
protection
of
the
individual
names
given
to
the
product
and
the
finish
product
sold
under
those
names,
the
finish
product
sold
by
the
dealer.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
yes
it
is.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
i
don't
know
what
exhibit
number
it
is
but
it's
--
they
got
some
fancy
names
to
some
of
these
products
like
carvel's
lollapalooza
and
mamapalooza
and
stuff
like
that
and
each
one
is
covered
by
a
trademark.
the
court
found
that
the
trademark
attached
to
the
end
product
ice
cream
which
is
a
carvel
ice
cream,
that's
the
specific
finding
almost
verbatim
in
the
lower
court
and
(inaudible)
above.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
it
could
be
--
it
would
do
this,
it
would
be
another
type,
it
would
be
a
passing
off
situation
because
these
stores
are
all
uniformed
and
the
consumer
acceptance
is
based
on
going
to
a
store
that
couldn't
be
mistaken
for
anything
else
other
than
a
carvel
store.
there's
only
450
square
feet
of
space
in
it,
it's
made
and
designed
especially
just
to
sell
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
no,
it's
not
like
that.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
no,
i
mean
it's
not
like
that
because
a
howard
johnson
is
a
big
place
where
you
can
sit
down
and
eat.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
oh,
yes.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
yes,
they
have
--
yes,
and
i
would
not
expect
howard
johnson
to
give
me
(inaudible)
ice
cream.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
well,
if
they
sign
--
the
protection
extends
to
a
franchise
dealer
under
this
agreement,
agreeing
to
sell
only
carvel
items
and
when
he
is
selling
something
that's
not
a
carvel
item,
the
customers
who
are
admittedly
are
attractive
to
the
place
because
it's
a
carvel
place,
he
is
doing
something
wrong,
he's
bullying
the
public.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
yes,
everything
he
sells
in
the
store.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
(inaudible)
except
paragraph
31
which
entitles
them
on
the
coca-cola
question.
paragraph
31
entitles
them
to
--
it's
on
page
214
of
the
record,
no,
paragraph
16,
214
of
the
record.
that
dealer
shall
have
the
right
to
install
one
soft
drink
cup
dispenser
vending
machine
and
one
cigarette
vending
machine
at
such
place
or
places
at
the
outside
of
the
store
only.
as
maybe
approved
by
carvel
so
that
they
can
have
an
outside
drink,
such
as
coca-cola
whatever
they
select
but
when
you
get
into
the
store,
what
you
buy
there
is
a
carvel
product.
and
if
you
don't
want
a
carvel
product
you
go
to
another
store.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
could
outside.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
no,
what
i
just
read
is
on
page
204
of
the
record.
we
didn't
--
i
don't
remember
that
we
referred
to
it
in
our
brief.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
well,
it
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
they
don't
sell
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
no,
they
don't
sell
brooms,
they
use
brooms
and
commissary
--
the
commissary
department
has
all
the
items
that
a
dealer
might
need
in
the
operation
of
his
store.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
well,
even
if
they
sell
carvel
brooms
it
wouldn't
be
right
because
it's
only
the
frozen
dairy
products
that
they're
licensed
to
sell.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
can't
sell
brooms.
can't
sell
unauthorized
can
--
if
some
of
them
tried
to
sell
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
yes.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
yes.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
that
some
of
them
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
no,
they
don't
have
to
buy
from
carvel.
that's
paragraph
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
yes,
those
are
in
the
430
items
that
you
don't
have
to
buy,
the
only
thing
they
have
to
buy
are
the
things
that
are
incorporated
in
what
the
public
gets
under
the
carvel
name.
now,
there
are
--
this
is
not
a
case,
a
tying
case
of
clue
in
the
usual
sense
of
the
term,
there
are
no
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
well,
i
wrote
it
down.
i
think
he
said
the
know-how
--
the
--
including
the
franchise
agreement,
the
uniformity
of
the
product,
the
recipes,
the
insignia,
the
identification,
to
me
this
is
a
lot
of
grief.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
he
includes
the
trademark.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
as
a
tying
element.
now
of
course
as
a
tying
--
if
it
were
a
--
the
minute
--
there
is
a
concession,
that
this
is
not
a
two-product
tying
arrangement.
we
are
out
of
clayton,
we
get
under
section
1
of
sherman
as
the
case
in
times-picayune
in
northern
pacific
i
think
it
was
decided
under
section
1
and
so
was
the
loew's
under
section
1.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
since
carvel
was
decided.
we
cited
in
our
brief
in
the
lower
circuits
involving
services
which
emphasized
that
the
minute
the
tying
element
is
other
than
a
product,
the
stringent
standard
approved
with
injury
to
the
interstate
commerce
required
by
section
1
comes
into
play.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
he
didn't
quite
say
so.
if
he
did,
it
escaped
me.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
he
said
that
it
was
a
tied
product.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
just
like
the
other
products.
now,
of
course
you
have
a
very
interesting
situation
that
you
have
the
--
if
you
presume
economic
follow-up
in
the
mere
existence
of
the
--
of
a
trademark,
let's
say
an
automobile
or
a
franchise
agreement,
then
you
apply
the
rule
that
are
not
insubstantial
amount
of
commerce
and
the
tied
product
is
all
that
you
need
and
every
dealer
in
the
country
is
subject
to
a
treble
damage
action
for
having
violated
that
kind
of
a
--
for
having
conducted
business
by
that
type
of
unlawful
tying
arrangement.
that
isn't
the
law
at
all,
the
way
we
see
it.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
yes.
i
--
oh,
the
example
i
gave
is
that
if
you
start
with
a
trademark,
let's
say
some
company
car,
company
x.
and
you
franchise
a
dealer
and
you
generate
a
presumption
as
judge
lumbard,
chief
judge
lumbard
indicates
that
the
mere
existence
of
the
trademark
shows
sufficient
economic
power
to
exert
leverage
to
control
competition
or
affect
competition
of
the
tied
product
and
the
tied
product
is
the
very
thing
for
which
the
trademark
exists.
as
is
the
case
of
mix
which
is
the
essential
product
then
you've
got
every
single
trademark
product
in
a
situation
of
being
an
unlawful
tying
agreement.
now
of
course,
i
don't
think
that
the
--
that
it's
appropriate
or
necessary.
in
this
case,
i
don't
understand
why
chief
judge
lumbard
ever
reached
the
question
of
whether
you
need
to
generate
a
presumption
from
the
existence
of
the
carvel
trademark
because
even
he
agreed
as
that
the
across
the
majority
in
the
district
court
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
injury
to
interstate
commerce.
indeed,
the
majority's
finding
is
that
there
was
not
even
an
insubstantial
amount
of
commerce
involved
which
is
the
less
stringent
standard
under
the
clayton
act.
and
this
was
remar
--
this
is
reminiscent
of
course
of
the
reminder
in
the
tampa
decision
of
this
court
that
where
the
evidence
isn't
sufficient
to
live
up
to
the
--
to
fulfill
the
less
stringent
standard
it's
certainly
won't
live
up
to
the
more
stringent
one.
so
that
--
in
view
of
the
shape
of
this
record,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
one
presumes
since
there's
an
admitted
actions
of
proof
of
economic
power
or
whether
one
doesn't
because
the
second
condition
is
not
present
namely
evidence
of
injury
to
competition
and
said
the
court
by
majority
not
even
by
the
less
stringent
rule
of
an
insubstantial
amount
of
commerce
being
involved.
now,
what
strikes
me
is
very
peculiar
and
this
has
been
bugging
me
throughout
the
proceeding,
is
the
lack
of
live
witnesses.may
it
please
the
court,
a
tying
arrangement
to
something
that
restricts,
something
that
you
feel
and
if
the
pinh
of
a
tying
arrangement
were
really
in
the
marketplace,
these
people
couldn't
keep
their
clients
off
the
stand.
nobody
appealed.
the
one
fellow
who
appealed
gave
testimony
about
a
joke
he
played.
he
made
a
--
i
don't
know
how
expensive,
a
very
expensive
ice
cream
cone
and
he
admitted
it's
stood
a
foot
high
and
begun
of
course
immediately
to
melt
and
he
was
--
he
happened
to
do
it
when
a
supervisor
came
in
and
he
got
a
lecture
about
it.
now,
that's
the
only
man
that
took
the
stand
and
the
only
evidence
we
have
and
it's
my
impression
that
with
the
absence
of
any
proof
from
clients
or
generally
readily
available
to
testify
that
this
complaint
about
tying
is
a
complaint
born
in
a
law
library
and
not
in
any
felt
restrictions
in
the
marketplace
and
the
lower
court
coming
to
this
stipulation,
the
late
judge
dawson
said
as
we
cited
in
our
brief,
he
had
occasion
to
say,
?during
the
trial
you
can
bring
any
witnesses
you
want,
nobody
restricted
these
people
from
trying
a
case
in
a
normal
way
to
indicate
what
their
complaint
was.?
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
pleadings
as
we
point
out
on
pages
7
to
9
of
our
brief
indicate
that
they
didn't
dream
about
even
premising
a
complaint.
in
the
nine
complaints
drawn
between
1900
and
1959
in
the
fall
and
the
spring
of
1960,
there
is
nothing
about
tying
in
the
complaint.
there
is
something
that
sounds
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out,
a
complaint
that
a
total
requirement
agreement
involves
refraining
without
compelling
the
dealers
to
refrain
from
buying
the
products
of
other
people.
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
about
the
argument
that
the
new
counsel,
i
don't
think
he'll
deny
that
most
of
the
answers
he
gave
is
based
on
a
record
that's
not
the
record
in
this
case.
i'm
in
both
cases,
so
i
know.
and
i
thought
that
mr.
rothstein,
the
former
counsel
had
drawn
the
limit
in
referring
to
the
initial
decision
of
a
trial
examiner
on
other
cases
a
reason
for
granting
certiorari.
i
mean
he
treated
as
it
is
though
it
was
almost
the
equivalent
of
a
split
between
the
circuits
about
which
i
--
you
know,
we
said
nothing.
but
now,
it's
another
matter
to
introduce
it
here.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
the
other
cases
were
started
after
judge
dawson's
decision
and
it's
a
section
5
case
and
it's
now
pending
on
appeal
from
the
initial
decisions
by
--
it's
an
all
together
different
record
and
as
we
point
out
and
i
shall
--
a
very
short
reply
brief,
the
examiner
himself
said
that
he
acknowledges
the
existence
of
the
second
circuit
decision
but
the
record
is
so
different
that
he
feels
the
extended
discussion
is
unnecessary.
he
just
not
--
they're
following
it.
and
he
found
the
tying
element
to
be
the
franchise
agreement
not
the
use
of
the
copyright.
so
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
since
the
trial
examiner
was
courteous
enough
to
ignore
the
persuasive
cause
of
the
circuit
proposition,
he
might
--
his
decision
here
might
be
a
court
of
the
same
courtesy
namely
to
ignore
it.
now,
the
trademark
is
one
area
which
indicates
a
certain
amount
of
permissive
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
owner
to
make
sure
he
controls
his
quality.
this
is
infused
with
the
existence
which
cannot
be
against
that
of
the
secret
processes,
the
trade
processes.
now,
there
is
no
monopoly
given
by
the
trademark
law.
the
trademark
law
is
merely
a
signature,
it's
a
method
of
identifying
the
product
so
that
the
public
wouldn't
be
fooled
as
to
their
source
and
it's
obvious
that
they
can
attach
as
mr.
justice
black
having
been
made
point
out
to
the
end
product
but
they
could
readily
--
it
doesn't
happened
to
be
the
case
here,
that's
why
i
answered
the
question
that
way.
you
could
have
a
trademark
which
attaches
to
some
components,
all
components
as
well
as
the
end
product
or
to
everything
down
the
line
including
the
wrapping
paper.
but
therefore
to
presume
that
this
--
the
use
of
a
trademark
indicates
sufficient
economic
power
to
exert
unlawful
leverage
seems
to
me
entirely
inappropriate.
now
the
solution
is
something
that
needs
a
word.
mr.
justice
harlan
suggested
that
chief
judge
lumbard
thought
it
ought
to
go
back.
well
that's
true,
except
he
said
it
ought
to
go
back
for
the
limited
purpose
of
giving
testimony
on
the
part
of
carvel
eliiting
testimony
which
didn't
satisfy
him
on
this
record,
that's
the
dissent
that
there
was
enough
justification
for
carvel
to
impose
these
restrictions
on
the
component
parts,
on
the
purchase
of
the
component
parts.
and
he
said
that
the
per
se
stipulation
condition
the
--
perhaps
the
falsity
of
the
evidence
and
that
the
courts
relied
on
evidence
in
his
estimation
very
meager
to
the
effect
that
the
publication
of
specifications
for
these
ingredients
in
order
to
make
sure
that
carvel's
ideas
would
be
carried
out
in
his
end
product
that
the
publication
of
such
specifications
would
be
unduly
burdensome.
he
said
if
carvel
is
able
to
submit
more
proof
than
it
had
on
that
point,
then
the
result
would
be
the
same,
meaning
that
he
would
be
in
accord
with
the
second
circuit.
now,
our
friends
are
not
satisfied
with
sending
the
case
back
for
that
purpose.
they
say
as
a
matter
of
law
that
carvel
is
compelled
--
would
be
compelled
to
publish
all
these
specifications
including
those
covering
his
trade
secrets.
and
i
have
seen
nothing
in
the
law
that
would
lead
to
such
a
--
(inaudible)
lead
to
such
a
conclusion.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
well,
it
makes
them
available
to
dairies
who
could
bid
for
the
business
and
do
direct
business
with
carvel.
now,
there
are
hundreds
of
these
dairies.
right
now,
carvel
gets
a
batch
report
on
each
batch
together
with
the
chemical
analysis
and
has
the
right
of
inspection.
it
con
--
it
preconditions
the
way
it's
packaged,
the
amount
of
packaging
so
that
the
man
when
he
gets
to
stop
in
a
store,
won't
put
in
too
much
and
get
that
quantity
or
put
too
little
in
and
cheat
the
public
or
get
their
quality
and
dissatisfy
the
public.
well,
how
was
he
--
how
are
you
going
to
police
it
with
hundreds
of
dairies
making
these
prods
--
making
these
products?
how
are
you
going
to
police
400
stores
in
the
--
and
the
majority
opinion
says
agrees
with
the
lower
court
and
says
there's
no
reason
for
disturbing
the
finding
that
it
would
be
an
undue
burden
and
an
unfeasible
cost,
and
uneconomic
thing
to
require
carvel
to
attempt
to
exercise
this
supervision.
meanwhile,
the
value
of
the
secret
formula
is
gone
because
you
can
keep
a
secret
maybe
when
you
have
four
or
five
contracts
with
selected
dairies
but
you
can't
keep
a
secret
when
hundreds
of
them
are
bidding
and
there's
nothing
wrong,
the
court
was
unanimous
about
the
drop
shipping
part
of
the
transaction.
that's
all
that
is.
this
is
a
perishable
commodity.
carvel
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
no.
no,
it's
a
secret
formula.
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
drop
shipment
feature
especially
when
it's
a
perishable
commodity.
carvel
is
really
the
buyer
for
resale.
he
is
responsible
financially
to
the
dairies.
the
dairies
may
like
that
better.
i
would
in
their
place.
i
look
to
carvel
for
payment.
the
dealers
don't
dislike
that.
the
courts
point
out
that
there
hasn't
been
any
testimony
or
any
showing
or
any
complaint
even
by
letter
that
they
would
want
to
buy
other
people's
ingredients.
the
trust
has
been
in
the
direction
that
mr.
--
i
think
mr.
justice
clark
suggested
or
was
it
mr.
justice
brennan?
some
of
them
wanted
to
sell
christmas
trees
off
the
premises
or
frankfurters.
they
wanted
to
expand
the
product
line.
there
was
no
complaint
and
the
courts
are
unanimous
about
a
desire
to
sell
non-carvel
ice
cream
ingredients.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
well,
as
the
--
i
think
the
case
ought
to
be
affirmed
but
they
think
that
the
specifications
ought
to
be
broadcast
to
the
world.
and
this
would
really
destroy
the
quality
of
the
business,
destroy
the
private
value
of
the
secret
formula
and
is
not
required
by
anything
that
i
see
in
the
law
especially
in
the
life
of
the
concurrent
findings
that
there
were
sufficient
testimony
that
it
would
be
unduly
burdensome
so
that
i
feel
that
if
any
case
ever
came
within
the
dictum
of
standard
stations,
i'm
referring
to
what
appears
at
30
--
at
page
306
of
the
report.
the
only
situation,
this
is
the
dictum
indeed
in
which
the
protection
of
goodwill
may
necessitate
the
use
of
time
clauses.
we
don't
even
concede
they're
time
clauses,
is
where
specifications
for
a
substitute
would
be
so
detailed
that
they
could
not
practicably
be
supplied.
we
think
this
case
is
a
total
requirements
case.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
well,
the
dealer
is
obliged
in
consideration
of
getting
into
the
franchised
chain
and
the
commitment
on
the
part
of
carvel
for
selling.
he
undertakes
the
commitment
to
buy
all
that
he
requires
of
the
essential
ingredients.
that's
still
the
requirement.
and
the
legality
or
illegality
of
that
is
measured
by
the
very
specific
criteria
laid
down
by
this
court
and
i
think
spelled
out
for
the
bar
and
what
i
consider
adequate
terms
in
tampa.
you've
got
to
fasten
on
a
relevant
market
and
show
that
the
relevant
market
has
been
captured
or
seriously
impaired.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
in
all
of
the
record
--
the
record
didn't
show
that.
the
petitioners
made
no
attempt
to
go
into
that.
the
petitioners
didn't
even
ask
for
because
most
of
the
figures
they
did
get
into
the
record,
they
got
it
by
way
of
stipulations.
they
didn't
ask
for
figures
as
to
what
the
sale
of
the
various
ingredients
amounted
to.
i
would
like
to
draw
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
record
contains
figures,
statistics
about
the
general
production
and
we
criticized
our
friends
reply
brief
because
he
is
comparing
what
he
calls
carvel's
soft
ice
cream
and
he
permits
himself
the
liberty
of
changing
the
heading
on
an
exhibit
which
is
special
formula
mix
and
it
is
justified
because
the
record
shows
that
this
carvel
formula
is
used
for
the
purpose
of
making
both
hard
and
soft
ice
cream.
now
he
chooses
to
compare
this
with
soft
ice
cream.
now
you
can't
compare
a
formula
which
is
used
by
the
dealers
to
build
up
a
substantial
business
on
hard
and
soft
ice
cream
items
with
soft
ice
cream.
if
you
compare
it
with
ice
cream,
you
get
--
not
the
fantastic
percentages
he's
talking
about
but
you
got
a
range
in
massachusetts
for
the
year
he
picked
out
in
1959
of
less
than
one-fifth
of
1%
to
a
high
in
new
jersey
of
3.3%,
the
next
figure
being
new
york
at
2.89%.
and
the
figure
in
the
new
york
market
is
1%
based
on
the
exhibits
in
this
record.
and
the
initial
decision
said
that
even
if
it
were
4%
for
new
york
and
nassau
county,
it
would
still
be
illegal
quoting
some
case
that
doesn't
apply.
and
then
saying
even
though
the
areas
entirely
intrastate,
it
could
be
a
sign
of
an
incipient
growth
or
injury
to
the
interstate
commerce
and
therefore
he
thinks
the
4%
even
though
it's
limited
to
one
intrastate
area
was
enough
under
section
5
but
that's
another
story
and
it
will
be
soon
decided
i
hope
by
the
commission.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
yes.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
yes.
if
your
honor
please
the
stabilizing
--
it's
a
formula
which
in
a
very
short
time
has
built
a
product
that
has
attracted
the
consumer
acceptance
to
the
extent
they're
advertised
by
my
friend.
in
his
brief,
he
says
there
were
three
billion
servings,
not
three
billion
customers
but
three
billion
servings
in
21
years.
and
there
must
be
something
about
it.
now
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
having
no
patent.
but
this
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
right
now
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
(inaudible)
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
is
that
the
one
by
--
right
now,
it's
protected
by
agreement
with
the
dairies
and
they
have
sedulously
preserved
that
secret.
now,
a
lot
of
competitors
have
been
trying
to
get
it.
the
trial
(inaudible)
--
the
trial
lawyers
with
the
commission
tried
to
get
it
on
open
court,
they
subpoenaed
the
secret
formula.
they
didn't
get
it
that
way
and
the
competitors
haven't
been
able
to
get
it.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
i
learned
from
my
amazement
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
well,
i
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
i
don't
think
--
i
think
--
i
don't
think
the
same
--
and
i
would
give
the
same
answer
with
the
same
cause
about
cones
or
perhaps
even
flavors
as
i
would
about
mix.
but
mix,
the
essential
part
would
injure
carvel
if
the
specifications
got
known.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
now,
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
and
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
and
the
publication,
the
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
yes.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
yes.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
if
your
honor
please,
the
nature
of
this
relationship
has
not
been
painted
in
an
accurate
way.
the
applicant
comes
into
carvel
and
he
says,
"i
would
like
to
go
into
the
ice
cream
business."
well
that's
fine.
he
didn't
have
to
come
to
carvel.
he
could
have
chosen
two
dozens
other
franchises
but
his
brief
says,
the
minute
he
talks
to
carvel,
carvel
tells
him
--
this
is
on
page
2
of
his
reply
brief,
carvel
tells
them
that
you
got
to
buy
my
ingredients
because
he
puts
at
most
to
the
commissary
goods
which
isn't
true.
see?
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
(inaudible)
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
well,
the
commissary
goods
are
not
the
ingredients.
those
are
430
items
that
have
--
that
he
can
buy
in
the
open
market.
he's
not
compelled
to
buy
those.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
well,
he
doesn't
buy
the
commissary
goods
for
resale
necessarily.
he
buys
them
in
order
to
operate
his
store.
but
the
things
that
he
puts
into
the
end
product
that
he
sells
to
the
public
as
carvel
ice
cream,
those
are
the
things
he
has
to
buy.
our
friends
says,
the
minute
he
learns
that,
this
applicant
learns
it,
the
franchise
applicant
has
but
one
choice.
why
does
he
have
one
choice?
he
could
walk
out
and
go
into
another
ice
cream
business.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
he
doesn't
have
to.
that
--
we're
talking
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
we're
taking
about
an
(inaudible)
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
why
does
he
have
a
right
to
say,
?i
have
a
right
to
use
your
building
and
please
i'm
willing
to
pay
you
a
royalty
but
let
me
buy
my
stuff
anywhere
i
want??
why
does
anyone
have
a
right
to
do
business
on
that
basis?
he
comes
in
for
a
franchise.
he
can
walk
out.
this
is
a
free
country.
if
he
doesn't
want
to
go
into
the
carvel
business
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
--
and
go
with
tastee
freez.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
we
don't
own
it.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
he
doesn't
--
if
your
honor
please,
he
doesn't
have
to
go
into
--
he
doesn't
have
to
move
out
of
his
chair
unless
he
agrees
to
take
this
type
of
a
building
and
put
up
these
kinds
of
song
--
suppose
he
wants
to
(voice

--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
supposed
he
puts
up
the
picture
of
his
wife
there.
it's
a
violation
of
the
agreement.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
(inaudible)
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
the
right
given
by
an
agreement
which
he
signed
at
that
time.
he
didn't
--
which
he
didn't
have
to
sign
in
any
respect.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
no

mr.
herman
l.
weisman
tying
what
--
to
what
sir?
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
well,
it
doesn't
happen
that
way
either
sir.
we
don't
have
any
buildings
to
sell.
we
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
no.
we
--
what
we
have
--
what
we
have
is
a
blueprint
and
the
kind
of
a
building
and
if
the
fellow
is
willing
as
my
friend
pointed
out,
we
locate
a
site
for
him
and
if
he
likes
it,
he
takes
it
and
the
building
is
built
and
then
he
sells
the
products
in
accordance
with
his
agreement,
not
of
which
he
has
to
do
unless
he
agrees
and
he
knows
all
about
what
he
has
to
do.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
i
don't
mean

mr.
herman
l.
weisman
no,
i
don't
mean
to

mr.
herman

my
time
is
up

mr.

no,
that's
mr.

your
honor.

well,
i

--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
i
don't
mean
to
invade
the
--
invade
your
time.
we
weren't
taking
about
tying.
if
you're
talking
about
tying
in
a
technical
sense
of
(inaudible)
--
i'll
answer
this
question
which
i
still
say
we're
not
tied.
what
you're
suggesting
is
that
even
as
a
total
requirement
contract,
we
may
be
unreasonably
demanding
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
well,
we
haven't
tied
anything
because
there
is
no
tying
element.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
but
it
doesn't
agree
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
he
doesn't
agree
to
this
piecemeal
sir.
it
agrees
to
it
in
whole
or
nothing.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
well,
i'm
sorry
that
we
couldn't
clarify
it
further
but
i
appreciate
the
extra
few
minutes
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
well,
i'm
--
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
i'm
hopeful
that
you
find
that
the
briefs
don't
move
away
from
the
right
words
and
that
we're
right
on
the
board.
mr.
herman
l.
weisman
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
for
the
respondent
h.p.
hood
&
sons.
these
actions
were
originally

mr.
herman
l.
weisman
i
think
your
time
was
up
too.
