justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
distinguish
between
the
mix
and
the
other
articles,
would
you
say
that
one
is
as
illegal
as
the
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
if
you
lose
on
the
--
any
of
them,
you're
going
to
lose
on
them
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
still
--
are
you
--
carrying
here
and
still
pressing
your
price
setting
charge,
i
take
it
you
are.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
pressing
the
separate
point
of
the
arrangement
between
carvel
and
the
--
and
say,
hood?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
apparently
you
would
still
permit
the
--
as
long
as
the
dealer
could
go
to
the
dairy
of
his
choice,
you'd
still
permit
that
dairy
to
make
the
same
arrangement
with
carvel.
justice
byron
r.
white
they'll
make
the
profit.
they'll
make
a
profit
--
justice
byron
r.
white
carvel
gets
for
its
license.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now
--
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
present
arrangement
carvel
makes
a
profit
on
the
resale.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
that
should
be
eliminated?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
--
that's
what
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
from
what
percentage
of
the
soft
ice
cream
business
is
--
do
the
carvel
stores
have,
let's
say
in
new
york
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
federal
trade
commission
find,
does
it
--
is
it
about
20%
or
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
several
--
that
the
200
or
300
or
400
carvel
stores
had
sold
at
retail
37%
of
the
soft
ice
cream
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
sold
all
over
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
there
some
figures
in
the
record
on
the
percentage
of
the
total
ice
cream
business
that
carvel
has
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
i
said
the
carvel
stores.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
are
no
figures
in
the
record
as
to
what
percentage
of
the
ice
cream
business
(inaudible)
that
the
carvel
stores
sell
at
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
--
i
just
--
again,
let
me
ask
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
carvel
stores
sell
at
retail
the
finished
product?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
percentage
of
the
total
ice
cream
business
in
the
state
of
new
york
are
then
sold?
do
the
carvel
stores
enjoy
at
retail?
not
carvel
the
carvel
stores,
are
there
any
figures
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
what
the
--
what
leverage
does
carvel
got
on,
a)
franchise,
b)
mix,
or
whatever
it
is
that
gives
it
some
power
over
the
side
products.
what
is
the
product
that
--
it
does
have
the
power
over
it
that
it
gives
it
some
leverage?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
you've
been
answering
it
i
know
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
(inaudible)
the
people,
now
you
can
answer
for
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
who
--
with
whom
does
carvel
compete
then
in
the
franchises,
the
other
people
who
are
going
around
looking
for
locations
and
looking
for
franchisees?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
we
have
any
in
--
you
say
--
do
we
have
any
information
in
the
record
at
all
as
to
what
carvel's
competition
is
with
--
in
this
regard?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
can
we
tell
whether
it's
satis
--
whether
carvel's
power
over
in
these
areas
is
enough
to
make
any
difference?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say
that
just
as
long
as
--
that
the
position
in
this
--
in
the
tying
product
is
irrelevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
--
you
wouldn't
--
he
would
use
it
--
he
would
use
the
mark,
wouldn't
he
of
the
deal?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
do
you
--
are
you
suggesting
that
it
really
doesn't
make
much
difference
to
carvel
what
kind
of
an
end
product
comes
out
the
public
is
buying?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
think
if
--
if
carvel
had
a
--
half
its
dealers
having
to
buy
these
tied
items
and
the
other
half
of
these
dealers
didn't
have
to
buy
them
at
all,
this
option.
but
it
just
so
happened
--
just
assume
that
the
both
of
--
both
sets
of
dealers
have
bought
the
same
average
amount
in
carvel.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
--
but
you
--
there
must
be
something
that
carvel
has
some
kind
of
leverage
that
carvel
has
on
its
dealers
to
make
them
buy
these
tied
items.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
--
and
the
franchise
is
really
worth
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
carvel
could
be
paid
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
without
the
tie,
it
wouldn't
be
paid
as
much.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
they
can
charge
royalty?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
trademark?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
what
you
make
