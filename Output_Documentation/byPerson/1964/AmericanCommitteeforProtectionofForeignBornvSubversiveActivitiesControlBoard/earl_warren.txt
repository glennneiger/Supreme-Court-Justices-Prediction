mr.
terris,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
did
they
say
there
would
never
be
any
evidence
to
that
effect
if
in
fact
they
were
doing
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
terris,
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
suppose
a
law
firm
was
headed
by
a
man
who
was
a
communist.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
was
employed,
let's
say
by
the
communist
party
to
do
nothing
but
defend
persons
who
were
charged
with
a
--
who
were
subject
to
deportation.
they're
claiming
to
be
subject
to
deportation,
would
that
law
firm
have
to
register?
chief
justice
earl
warren
unless
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
start
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
start
with
that
premise
that
he's
a
dominating
factor
and
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no.
he
defends
anyone
who
comes
along.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
the
communist
party
employs
him
to
--
to
represent
those
members
of
the
party
who
were
subject
to
deportation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
(voice

organization
because
these
people
are
not
--
are
not
corporations.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now
unless,
one
is
loosely
organize
as
this
but
a
law
firm.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he's
paid
to
do
that.
he's
paid
to
do
that
but
they
also
do
other
things.
they
also
represent
other
clients
and
represent
other
persons
in
deportation
cases
who
were
not
communist
such
as
these
people.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
record
shows
these
local
organizations
are
controlled
by
the
one
here
in
litigation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
as
i
say
and
we
have
a
national
legal
aid
society
for
instance
and
there
are
a
lot
of
independent
legal
agents
by
these
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
all
over
the
country
that
are
more
or
less
affiliated
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
with
the
national
organization,
but
at
most,
it's
controlled,
controlled
by
it.
suppose
a
national
organization
was
paid
for
this,
you
say
this
one
was
--
would
all
those
locals
have
to
be
--
have
to
register?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you're
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
not
sure
about
the
relationship
here
either
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
record
didn't
show
it
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
why
would
you
be
more
hesitant
about
answering
the
question
concerning
the
--
concerning
the
legal
aid
bureaus?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
that
all
of
the
money
supporting
this
organization
came
from
dues
members
and
all
the
sources
of
the
government
would
insist
that
those
--
they
included
this
contribution,
would
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
have
to
have
dues?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
forer
--
is
that
a
standard
or
pattern
that's
in
the
statute
or
is
that
a
discretionary,
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
forer?
