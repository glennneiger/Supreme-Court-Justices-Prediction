mr.
joseph
forer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
a
review
an
order
of
the
subversive
activities
control
board
directing
the
petitioner,
the
american
committee
for
protection
of
foreign
born
to
register
as
a
communist-front
organization
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
subversive
activities
control
act.
such
an
order
has
very
serious
and
drastic
consequences
to
any
organization
to
which
it
is
addressed.
in
the
first
place,
the
order
represents
and
it
is
accompanied
by
a
governmental
--
a
governmental
determination
that
the
organization
to
which
it
is
addressed
is
a
subversive
organization.
secondly,
the
organization
has
to
acquiesce
in
that
brand
of
it
by
the
government
by
registering
itself
with
the
attorney
general
as
a
communist-front
organization.
in
addition,
it
must
file
a
registration
statement
in
which
it
divulges
to
the
eyes
of
the
public
and
to
the
attorney
general
with
whom
it
has
filed
various
details
concerning
its
internal
affairs
including
the
names
of
all
its
dues
paying
members
and
all
its
contributors.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
no.
the
communist-action
organizations
have
to
list
all
their
members
and
contributors.
communist-front
organizations
don't
have
to
list
all
their
members
but
they
do
have
to
list
all
the
sources
from
which
they
receive
their
revenue.
and
under
the
regulations
of
the
attorney
general
in
fact
they
have
a
copy
of
the
form
right
there.
they
have
to
list
the
names
and
address
of
every
person
from
whom
they
received
a
nickel.
and
that
is
why
i
was
careful
to
say
not
that
they
have
to
list
all
their
members
but
that
they
have
to
list
all
their
dues
paying
members.
they
don't
have
to
list
members
that
don't
pay
their
dues.
in
addition
to
that,
the
act
imposes
certain
sanctions
on
the
organization
and
on
its
members
which
become
effective
as
soon
as
the
registration
order
becomes
effective.
the
organization
is
required
to
label
its
publications,
its
radio
broadcast
and
any
television
broadcast
as
being
disseminated
by
a
communist
organization.
the
organization
is
denied
any
tax
exemptions
and
contributions
to
it
are
not
tax
deductible.
employees
of
the
organization
are
not
permitted
to
be
on
the
social
security
roles
and
no
government
employee
and
no
employee
in
a
defense
plan
may
make
any
contributions
or
perform
any
services
for
the
organization.
mr.
joseph
forer
there
are
a
few
minor
differences.
and
i'll
--
and
those
are
basic
--
those
differences
are
basically
with
regard
to
the
sanctions
on
the
members
rather
than
on
the
organization
itself.
these
that
i
have
just
mentioned,
the
sanctions
on
the
organization
are
true
of
the
communist-action
and
communist-front
organization.
so
far
as
the
members
are
concerned,
in
both
front
and
action
organization,
the
members
are
denied
employment
with
the
federal
government
or
with
labor
unions.
in
an
action
organization,
the
members
can
even
work
in
privately
owned
defense
plans
or
defense
facilities.
in
the
front
organization,
they
make
a
nominal
distinction
in
favor
of
the
members
of
the
front.
theoretically,
they
are
allowed
to
work
for
a
defense
facility
but
only
if
they
volunteer
to
the
management
and
disclose
to
the
management
that
they
are
members
of
the
subversive
organization,
then
if
the
management
is
still
willing
to
employ
them
why
then
they
can
have
such
employment.
members
of
the
organization
are
not
elligible
to
receive
scholarships
or
tuition
loans
under
a
federal
aid
education
programs.
members
of
the
organization
if
they
are
--
who
are
aliens
cannot
be
--
cannot
be
naturalized,
they
are
subject
to
deportation,
and
if
they
were
recently
naturalized
within
the
preceding
five
years,
they
are
liable
to
denaturalization.
now,
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
the
net
effect
of
the
brand,
the
registration,
the
laws
of
privacy,
and
these
sanctions
is
to
destroy
any
organization
which
like
this
organization
depends
on
the
goodwill
of
the
public,
to
destroy
the
right
of
association
in
the
organization.
it
should
destroy
the
ability
of
the
organization
to
promote
its
cause
and
to
attempt
to
enlist
public
support.
now,
why
was
this
done
to
this
organization,
and
that
brings
me
to
the
definition
of
a
communist-front
organization.
in
order
to
get
to
that,
let
me
first
take
up
the
definition
of
a
communist-action
organization.
that
definition
in
substance
is
an
organization
which
is
substantially
controlled
by
the
soviet
union
and
which
operates
to
advance
the
seditious
objectives
attributed
to
the
world
communist
movement
in
section
2
of
the
act.
and
the
communist-action
organization
meant
to
refer
to
the
communist
party
and
that
no
one's
amazement
on
april
20th,
1953
the
subversive
activities
control
board
found
that
the
communist
party
was
the
communist-action
organization.
now,
a
communist-front
organization
has
somewhat
the
same
relationship
to
a
communist-action
organization.
in
this
sense,
first
of
all,
there
are
two
components
of
what
constitutes
a
communist-front
organization.
first,
the
organization
has
to
be
substantially
controlled
by
the
communist-action
organization,
that
is
by
the
communist
party.
i
may
say
to
begin
with
that
this
control
isn't
the
kind
of
enforcible
control
that
you
could
put
your
hand
on
that
a
master
has
over
a
servant,
that
a
parent
corporation
has
over
a
subsidiary.
control
for
the
purposes
of
the
act
as
it
was
interpreted
in
the
communist
party
case
is
a
kind
of
psychological
disposition
to
whereby
the
body
that
is
controlled
tends
to
agree
or
with
the
body
which
controls
it
because
of
the
source
from
which
the
opinion
comes
rather
than
on
the
basis
of
it's
own
independent
judgment.
so
the
first
component
is
--
of
a
communist-front
organization
is
that
is
substantially
controlled
in
this
sense
by
the
communist
party.
and
the
second
component,
which
is
what
i
call
in
my
brief
the
aid
component
has
to
do
with
what
the
organization
does,
and
it
must
be
and
i
quote
now,
“primarily
operated
for
the
purpose
of
giving
aid
and
support
to
the
communist
party
or
to
a
communist-action
organization.
now,
i
would
like
to
take
up
first
the
--
what
i
consider
to
be
the
most
important
issue
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
board's
construction
of
the
aid
component
and
my
contention
that
first
the
board
must
construe
the
aid
component
and
secondly
if
it'sconstruction
is
right
the
act
is
palpably
unconstitutional.
so
far
as
the
control
component
is
concerned
and
i'll
try
to
get
to
that
if
time
permits,
i
have
attempted
in
the
briefs
to
examine
the
various
elements
on
which
the
board
based
its
determination
of
control.
and
in
my
opinion,
we
stablished
that
the
board
used
erroneous
standards
that
it
misconstrued
the
act
in
numerous
respects
and
made
many
evidentiary
mistakes.
but
let
me
first
get
to
the
aid
component,
in
the
basis
on
which
the
american
committee
was
held
that
they
primarily
operated
for
the
purpose
of
giving
aid
and
support
to
the
communist
party.
now,
the
american
committee
has
been
actively
in
business
since
1933
and
the
first
thing
that
we
know
is
what
it
does
not
do
that
conceivably
might
constitute
giving
aid
and
support
to
a
communist-action
organization.
there
is
no
contention,
no
suggestion,
no
evidence
and
no
finding
that
the
american
committee
engages
or
has
ever
engaged
in
violence
or
insurrection
or
has
advocated
violence
or
insurrection.
in
fact,
there
is
no
contention
that
the
american
committee
has
ever
attempted
to
promote
any
kind
of
marx's
ideology
or
any
other
doctrine
seeking
fundamental
change
in
society,
in
our
society
as
distinguished
from
reforms
within
the
structure
of
our
society.
neither
is
there
any
suggestion
that
the
american
committee
has
at
anytime
aided
the
communist
party
organizationally,
there
is
no
suggestion
and
no
finding
that
the
american
committee
is
going
out
and
recruited
members
for
the
communist
party
or
that
it
has
raised
money
for
the
communist
party.
this
is
what
the
organization
does
not
do.
now,
what
does
it
do
or
what
has
it
done
that
was
held
to
constitute
aiding
and
supporting
the
communist
party.
both
the
board
and
the
court
found
that
the
american
committee's
primary
activity
and
in
fact
its
only
activity
consisted
of
a
best
variety
of
activities
designed
to
advanced
the
interest
of
the
foreign
born
in
this
country.
there
was
educational
works,
service
works
such
as
helping
people
with
their
naturalization
problems,
legislative
work
and
so
forth.
but
the
thing
that
bulks
the
largest
in
this
case
is
what
is
called
the
american
committee's
defense
work,
and
this
defense
work
consists
of
the
defending
aliens
who
are
involved
in
deportation
proceedings
or
naturalized
citizens
who
are
involved
in
the
denaturalization
proceedings.
in
those
cases,
the
american
committee
sponsors
the
litigation
if
it
is
asked
for
a
sponsored
litigation
at
all
levels
and
if
it
is
a
litigable
case
from
the
immigration
service
to
and
including
this
court
and
there
has
been
numerous
cases
sponsored
by
the
american
committee
in
this
court.
it
furnishes
counsel
if
the
alien
doesn't
have
its
own
counsel,
it
pays
all
expenses
of
the
litigation.
and
also,
it
is
customary
that
the
american
committee
not
only
defends
the
individual
in
the
litigation
itself
but
it
puts
on
the
public
defense
forum.
that
has
caused
the
attention
of
the
public
to
a
sad
situation
to
the
action
generally
considered
arbitrary
of
the
immigration
service,
department
of
justice,
and
so
forth.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes,
relatively
few
of
those.
for
one
thing,
there
are
--
there
aren't
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
very
many
of
those.
mr.
joseph
forer
the
great
--
but
mostly
deportation
cases
but
also
some
denaturalization
case.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes,
i'm
coming
to
that.
the
record
is
clear
and
it
is
undisputed
that
the
american
committee
defends
every
alien
involved
in
a
deportation
case
who
seeks
its
help
without
any
conditions,
without
asking
any
questions
and
regardless
of
the
nature
of
the
accusation
and
the
same
thing
is
true
of
a
naturalized
citizen
faced
with
a
denaturalization
case.
and
this
stems
from
the
general
position
of
the
american
committee
that
it
is
opposed
to
all
deportations
of
resident
aliens
no
matter
for
what
reason
and
it's
opposed
to
all
denaturalizations
no
matter
for
what
reasons.
and
that
policy
has
been
publicly
proclaimed
that
was
found
by
the
court,
there's
no
evidence
to
the
contrary,
mountains
of
evidence
in
its
face.
now,
among
the
cases,
which
the
american
committee
has
defended
and
is
all-time
--
defended
at
in
political
cases.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
very
first
case
that
this
record
shows
that
the
american
committee
that
we
know
about,
this
was
a
1935,
the
american
committee
was
defending
the
case
of
a
man
by
the
name
of
alfred
miller.
alfred
miller
was
a
jewish
refugee
from
nazi,
germany
and
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
was
trying
to
deport
him
back
to
nazi,
germany
and
sure
death
on
an
allegation
that
he
has
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
in
nazi,
germany.
that's
the
first
political
case
that
we
know
of
that
the
american
committee
was
defending.
but
these
cases
were
relatively
few
and
far
between
among
the
cases
defended
by
the
american
committee
until
the
cold
war
started
in
1946
when
the
department
of
justice
started
a
full-scale
deportation
drive
against
the
alleged
members
or
past
members
of
the
communist
party.
they
brought
these
cases
by
the
hundreds
and
thousands
as
the
record
abundantly
shows.
this
drive
was
not
limited
to
security
risks.
it
was
limited
to
people
who
are
nominal
members.
it
included
people
who
are
nominal
members,
it
included
people
who
were
long
time
passed
members,
who
had
been
members
of
the
communist
party
for
only
a
short
time,
people
who
are
long
time
residents,
who's
families
were
disrupted,
often
involved
a
dubious
evidence
and
it
also
involved
some
pretty
harsh
procedures
including
holding
aliens
without
debts.
now,
many
of
the
aliens
that
got
involved
in
this
onslaught
were
poor,
it
couldn't
afford
a
counsel,
and
this
is
all
in
the
record,
others
could
afford
counsel,
and
they
went
to
their
regular
lawyers
in
the
1940s
and
their
lawyers
refused
to
represent
them
because
they
were
afraid.
and
still
others
who
got
counsel
and
the
counsel
didn't
know
anything
about
the
deportation
cases.
and
it
was
natural
for
them
and
many
of
them
did
it,
they
go
to
the
only
place
that
was
publicly
commited
to
defending
anybody
involved
in
a
deportation
case
and
that
had
the
ability
and
the
resources
and
the
knowhow
of
the
defendant.
and
the
american
committee
litigated
as
a
test
case
not
knowing
at
the
time
that
this
would
then
be
considered
evidence
against
it,
the
case
of
peter
harisiades
in
which
this
court
upheld
for
the
first
time
the
constitutionality
of
the
political
grounds
for
deporting
past
membership
in
the
communist
party
and
the
american
committee
lost
that.
it
then
managed
somewhat
later
to
recoup
some
of
that
ground
by
interpretation
by
winning
the
rowoldt
case
in
which
the
majority
opinion
was
written
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
and
more
recently
the
gastelum-quinones
case
in
which
a
majority
opinion
was
written
by
mr.
justice
goldberg.
the
one
witness
in
the
position
denote
the
number
of
cases,
political
cases,
as
compared
to
other
cases
handled
by
the
american
committee
was
abner
green,
the
executive
secretary
of
the
committee,
now
dead.
and
mr.
green
estimated
that
in
a
20-year
period,
the
american
committee
has
sponsored
somewhere
between
three
and
4000
cases
of
which
350
to
400
were
political
cases.
the
board
said
--
well,
it
didn't
think
the
proportion
was
particularly
significant
but
it
thought
that
the
proportion
was
much
larger
and
it
estimated
about
50%,
it
never
said
on
where
it
based
its
estimate
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
on
which
it
based
its
estimate.
but
the
fact
is
that
both
estimates
were
the
cases
in
which
the
accusation
was
a
communist
party
membership
and
frequently
the
accusation
turned
out
to
be
wrong
and
in
which
the
accusation
was
not
only
a
present
membership
but
also
of
past
membership.
now,
when
--
when
the
american
committee
got
involved
in
this
case
to
this
extent
and
in
view
of
the
atmosphere,
the
time
at
that
point,
the
american
committee
stopped
being
a
respectable
organization
as
far
as
the
government
was
concerned.
government
officials
no
longer
came
to
speak
on
its
affairs
and
it
made
the
attorney
general's
list
of
subversive
organizations
in
1949.
now,
the
board's
theory
is
that
in
determining
that
the
meaning
of
the
aid
components
of
what
is
giving
aid
and
support
to
the
communist
party,
they
said
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
organization
actually
does,
it
is
what
they
called
the
motive
--
purpose
by
which
they
meant
motive
for
what
board
does.
and
the
board
found
that
the
primary
motive
or
primary
purpose
they
call
to
the
american
committee
was
to
defend
the
members
of
thecommunist
party
in
deportation
cases
and
it
recognizes
that
they
are
always
non-communist
cases,
but
it
said
that
that
wasn't
inconsistent
with
its
primary
motivation,
its
primary
purpose.
and
on
that
basis,
it
held
that
the
american
committee
satisfied
the
aid
component
of
a
communist-front
definition.
now,
i
may
say
that
the
evidence
on
which
they
drew
this
inference
of
motive
seems
to
me
that
the
--
well,
it
just
outlandish
and
i
have
a
whole
section
of
the
brief
devoted
to
each
bit
of
evidence
from
which
they
drew
that
inference
but
i
can't
get
into
that
now.
but
that
was
the
theory
of
the
board.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
had
a
somewhat
different
theory.
it
didn't
talk
about
motive,
it
said,
“yes,
the
major
emphasis
of
the
committee's
work
was
this
defense
activity”
and
it
said
“this
--
this
defense
of
every
alien
that
sought
its
help
was
a
very
laudable
thing”.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
many
of
the
cases
that
the
american
committee
won,
were
won
in
that
very
court.
it
said
it
was
a
very
laudable
thing
but
this
laudable
activity
constituted
aid
and
support
to
the
communist
party
and
therefore
made
the
organization
subversive
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
it
said
some
of
the
aliens
whom
it
defended
were
accused
of
being
communist
and
some
of
them
those
who
were
so
accused
actually
happened
to
be
communist,
and
in
so
far
as
the
american
committee
defended
people
who
were
members
of
the
communist
party.
they
said,
“obviously,
that
benefited
the
communist
party”
and
therefore
in
that
respect
the
american
committee
satisfied
the
aid
component
by
aiding
the
communist
party.
but
it
said
there
was
a
more
subtle
way
in
which
the
american
committee
aided
the
communist
party.
it
says
the
american
committee
goes
around
engaging
in
all
these
laudable
activities
having
laudable
objectives
and
doing
good
deeds
and
it
gets
a
lot
of
public
credit
for
it
and
it
said
that
helps
the
ameri
--
that
helps
the
public
image
of
the
communist
party.
and
in
that
way,
in
this
subtle
way,
the
american
committee
helps
the
communist
party
because
the
communist
party
gets
credit
for
the
good
deeds
of
the
american
committee.
this
on
the
face
of
it
seems
to
me
to
be
preposterous.
in
any
event,
the
government's
brief
now
repudiates
that
theory
because
it
is
manifestedly
inconsistent
with
the
government's
contention
that
one
of
the
things
that
distinguishes
and
makes
it
necessary
to
apply
the
act
to
communist-front
organizations
is
that
they
hide
their
connections
with
the
communist
party.
well,
if
they
hide
their
connections
with
the
communist
party,
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
say
that
the
communist
party
gets
credit
for
their
good
deeds.
so
that
is
repudiated
by
the
government
and
we
come
down
to
the
proposition
that
the
sin
of
the
american
committee,
the
thing
that
makes
the
american
committee
satisfy
the
aid
component
of
the
act
is
that
it
depends
among
other
aliens,
persons
who
actually
are
members
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
joseph
forer
no
sir.
the
--
and
that
again
is
examined
in
detail
in
the
brief,
i
may
say
incidentally,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
the
of
course
the
aid
component
talked
about
its
primary
activity,
so
even
if
there
were,
it
would
still
be
a
question
of
what
its
primary
activities
are.
but
there
is
no
eivdence
that
the
american
committee
did
anything
but
seek
to
advance
the
interest
of
the
foreign
born
according
to
its
light.
now,
what
the
board
did
and
what
the
government
does
in
its
brief,
american
committee
puts
out
a
47-page
pamphlet
written
by
abner
green.
this
pro
style,
the
board
couldn't
stand
and
neither
can
the
government
apparently.
and
in
this
47-page
pamphlet,
he
theorizes
about
why
do
you
have
these
kind
of
political
deportation,
it
says
it's
part
of
the
whole
atmosphere
caused
by
persecuting
communists
in
the
smith
act
prosecutions
and
so
forth.
so
out
of
the
47-page
pamhplet
dealing
with
deportation
cases,
the
board
picks
out
one
sentence
in
which
he
says
look
at
the
smith
act
and
look
at
the
rosenberg
cases,
and
say,
“see
the
american
committee
is
the
party
from
this
purpose.”
all
those
things
are
examined
and
in
my
opinion,
that's
what
i
meant
when
i
said
the
outlandish
basis
on
which
the
board
infered
its
purpose
and
i'll
go
into
that
in
detail.
the
point
i
am
making
now
is
that
there
is
no
question
on
this
record
and
from
the
findings
of
the
board
and
from
the
findings
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
american
committee
sin
was
that
it
defends
communist
in
depotation
cases.
now,
i
suppose
that
that
sin
is
compounded
because
it
had
so
often
won
some
of
those
cases,
of
course,
aided
and
defended
in
that
respect
by
the
federal
courts,
sometimes
including
this
one.
mr.
joseph
forer
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
the
other
part
is
--
mr.
joseph
forer
--
control.
but
you
have
to
have
both
sins
in
order
to
meet
the
statutory
definition.
now,
first
i
want
to
say
that
we
think
that
that
is
a
thoroughly
unsound
interpretation
of
the
aid
component.
and
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
aid
component,
in
the
first
place,
it
wouldn't
depend
on
motivation,
it
would
depend
on
what
the
organization
did
and
it
means
that
the
organization
has
to
be
engaged
in
activities
or
primarily
engaged
in
activities,
which
aid
in
some
reasonably
direct
manner.
the
supposed
illicit
objectives,
which
by
definition
characterized
a
communist-action
organization
which
it
supposedly
aiding,
for
example,
that
it
advocates
violence
or
marx's
ideology
or
it
aids
the
organization
--
organizationally
by
recruiting
for
it,
raising
money
or
something
of
that
sort.
but
it
does
not
in
our
opinion
and
cannot
constitutionally
hold
activities
which
are
considered
laudable
and
benign
if
they
are
done
by
anybody
else
on
the
grounds
that
somehow
these
activities
might
conceivably
in
some
possible
indirect
way
or
might
be
motivated
to
benefit
the
communist
party
or
to
coincide
with
some
clauses
that
communist
support
along
with
non-communist.
under
the
construction
of
the
board
and
the
court,
if
you
had
a
hospital
which
was
run
by
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
that
hospital
took
in
as
part
of
its
services,
persons
who
are
members
of
the
communist
party
as
well
as
persons
who
were
not
members
of
the
communist
party
that
would
be
aid
and
support
for
the
communist
party
and
it
would
satisfy
the
means
component.
and
since
you
had
a
member
of
the
communist
party
running
it,
it
would
--
it
would
satisfy
the
control
component
and
the
hospital
would
have
to
register.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
think
it
--
mr.
joseph
forer
i
think
if
these
were
a
field
hospital
on
the
battlefield,
that
would
be
different.
but
we
don't
have
a
battlefield
here.
and
anyway,
this
is
not
a
hospital
in
a
battlefield
in
this
case
that
had
been
in
this
court.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
was
using
an
example,
i'm
glad
you
pointed
out
it's
not
a
very
good
one.
i'll
withdraw
it.
this
interpretation
in
which
organizations
are
condemned
by
this
registration
centers
because
of
activities,
which
are
conceededly
laudable,
is
simply
in
confict
with
the
act's
purpose,
in
the
act's
term.
the
justification
of
the
act
is
set
forth
in
section
2
of
the
act,
is
that
the
act
is
necessary
to
avert
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
american
institution.
the
title
of
the
act
is
that
it's
--
to
control
subversive
activities.
and
the
board
is
a
subversive
activities
control
board.
in
the
communist
party
case,
the
majority
opinion,
the
court
recognize
that
there
was
a
restraint
on
the
first
amendment
interest
of
communist
by
the
registration
order
involved
there
but
it
held
that
these
interests
were
outbalanced
by
the
fact
that
the
communist
party
supposedly
engaged
in
actually
dangerous
activities.
and
it
said
that
the
interest
of
the
communist
party
and
its
members
were
outbalanced
by
“the
exigency
--
the
exigencies
of
sole
preservation
and
the
values
of
liberty”
which
were
menaced
by
the
supposed
foreign
control
criminal
conspiracy.
now,
we
don't
have
any
--
anything
like
that
here
or
claim
here.
it
is
impossible
to
see
how
the
exigencies
of
self-preservation
and
the
values
of
liberty
would
be
served
by
depriving
aliens
of
counsel
and
upheld
in
cases
in
which
they
are
proceeded
against
by
the
department
of
justice.
under
the
holding
of
the
communist
party
case,
the
communist
party
itself
would
be
required
to
register
even
if
it
was
held
to
satisfy
the
controlled
component,
on
the
grounds
that
--
if
the
only
activity
it
participated
in
was
concededly
non-dangerous
and
non-subversive.
for
example,
if
the
communist
party
indirectly
aided
the
soviet
union
by
furnishing
legal
aid,
the
russian
citizens
are
promoting
the
russian
ballet
in
this
country,
they
could
not
satisfy
the
requirements
that
the
--
this
court
found
necessary
as
applied
to
communist-action
organization.
and
yet
here,
an
organization
is
required
to
regisrer
without
any
showing
of
dangerous
activity.
in
the
cramp
case,
this
court
invalidated
the
florida
oath
which
made
government
employees
disclaim
aid
and
support
to
the
communist
party.
and
the
court
said,
“well,
aid
and
support
of
the
communist
party
has
all
kinds
of
possible
absurd
--
”
it
has
absurd
possibility,
that
because
of
this
absurd
possibility,
the
oath
is
no
good,
well,
it's
too
vague
and
well
invalidated.
and
among
the
absurd
possibilities
that
the
court
referred
to
in
cramp
and
which
later
on
mr.
justice
white
referred
to
in
the
baggett
case,
a
similar
oath,
was
a
lawyer
who
represented
the
communist
party
or
its
members
or
a
journalist
who
defends
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
communist
party
or
its
members,
or
anybody
who
supports
any
clause
which
is
likewise
supported
by
communist
or
the
communist
party.
and
the
court
just
recoiled
from
the
fact
that
this
should
be
considered
aid
and
support
to
the
communist
party
but
said
that
because
such
outrageous
things
could
be
considered
aid
and
support
to
the
communist
party,
they
would
invalidate
the
oath.
now,
in
baggett
against
bullitt,
mr.
justice
clark
felt
that
the
interpretation
was
so
extravagant
that
nobody
in
their
right
mind
could
possibly
so
apply
the
oath.
and
he
said
to
anybody
who
interpreted
the
oath
that
way
would
be
like
gulliver's
mad
scientist.
now,
in
this
case
the
--
we
don't
have
a
note
but
we
have
an
act
which
can
be
interpreted
and
administered
by
the
board
and
there's
no
reason
for
them
to
interpret
the
oath
the
way
gulliver's
mad
scientist
might
have
interpreted
and
i
think
the
legislative
history
supports
the
interpretation
i
proposed.
at
page
45
of
my
brief,
i
quote
from
the
house
report
on
the
bill
and
the
committee
there
said
that
it
found
it
necessary
at
the
outset
to
distinguish
those
features
the
communist
activity
against
which
legislation
cannot
and
should
not
be
directed
from
those
in
the
case
of
which
legislative
restraints
are
clearly
practicable
and
necessary.
so
the
committee
forwarded,
it
should
and
that
it
had
to
distinguish
between
benign
activities
and
subversive
activities,
communist
activities
and
this
--
most
such
distinction
is
made
by
the
construction
of
the
government.
section
2
(7)
of
the
act
refers
to
communist-front
organizations
as
being
organizations
which
are
operated
--
which
communist-action
organization
is
operated
in
carrying
on
the
activities
refered
to
in
paragraph
2
(6)
of
the
act.
that
is
communist-front
organizations
are
used
by
action
organizations
to
carry
on
the
activities
in
2
(6).
if
you
look
at
2
(6)
these
are
all
conspiratorial,
wicked,
danger-causing
activities.
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
representing
aliens
in
deportation
cases.
now,
the
government's
theory
as
far
as
i
can
make
it
out
is
that
you
can
stop
communists
from
engaging
in
protected
activities
which
everybody
else
could
engage
in
if
it
would
in
anyway
benefit
the
communist
party
and
since
you
can't
stop
the
communist
from
doing
it,
therefore
you
can
stop
an
organization
which
is
controlled
by
communist,
but
it's
the
same
thing.
it
seems
to
me
that
both
parts
of
it
syllogism
are
wrong.
according
to
them,
it's
alright
for
wendell
willkie
to
represent
mr.
schneiderman
in
a
denaturalization
case
in
this
court
because
he's
not
controlled
by
communists
but
it
would
be
improper
for
mr.
schneiderman
to
defend
themselves
because
he
himself
was
a
communist.
now,
since
the
dijon
case
has
been
established
that
--
that
communists
cannot
be
restrained
from
engaging
in
the
first
ammendment
activities,
peaceful
first
amendment
activities,
just
because
they
are
communists,
the
point
was
again
made
in
the
scales
case
which
mr.
justice
harlan
wrote
the
majority
opinion.
and
in
the
aptheker
case,
the
past
--
recent
passport
case,
this
court
again
held
that
communists
can't
be
restrained
from
engaging
in
peaceful
activities
open
everybody
else
just
because
they
are
communists.
insofar
as
this
court
has
upheld
legislation
address
against
communists,
like
the
section
9
(h)
taft-hartley
anti-communist
affidavit,
it
is
done
so
on
the
theory
that
the
activity
that
was
restrained
had
a
direct
connection
with
danger-causing
activity.
so
even
communists
can't
be
engaged
from
an
--
can't
be
restrained
from
engaging
in
such
protected
activity.
and
the
situation
becomes
worst
when
you
extend
this
doctrine
that
communists
have
no
constitutional
rights
the
government
is
obliged
to
respect
for
organizations
which
are
supposed
to
be
controlled
by
the
communist
party.
in
the
first
place,
this
control
is
a
metaphysical
concept
under
the
act.
it's
an
opinion.
it's
not
a
fact.
the
second
place
has
been
cited
by
adminstrative
board
not
by
a
judicial
body,
not
by
a
jury
which
relies
and
the
government
says
it
is
entitled
to
rely
on
hearsay,
opinion
evidence,
remote
evidence,
speculative
inferences
and
then
after
all
that
it's
decision
is
entitled
a
great
weight.
the
upshot
of
it
is
that
under
the
board's
theory,
the
act
imposes,
gives
the
federal
government
an
unprecedented
and
virial
in
power
to
supervise
close
organizations.
no
matter
how
laudable
and
benign
their
activities,
the
government
is
now
supposed
to
spy
on
the
organization
to
determine
if
they
have
hidden
motivations.
or
if
some
of
their
officers
are,
or
once
were,
or
is
said
to
be
affiliated
with
the
communist
party,
and
then
if
it
concludes
that
they
are
aware
to
hold
them
to
account
before
the
subversive
activities
control
board.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joseph
forer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
just
very
difficult
for
me
to
believe,
in
fact
i
just
find
it
repugnant
to
believe
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
impose
this
kind
of
destructive
control
of
an
organization
which
concededly
does
nothing
but
constitutionally
protected
laudable
activities
on
the
finding
by
the
administrative
agency
that
the
hidden
motivation,
which
he
calls
purpose,
that
the
hidden
motivation
for
these
agencies
is
to
help
the
communist
party.
mr.
joseph
forer
well
--
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
he
says
hidden.
he
says
they're
exposing
the
real
nature
whether
it's
hidden
or
not
on
the
--
an
ulterior
motive
that's
what
it
amounts
to.
he
says
the
american
committee
here
does
nothing
else
let
it
say,
leaving
aside
some
of
the
activities
that
they
don't
even
question,
does
nothing
else
but
defend
aliens
in
deportation
cases
oversimplified
a
bit.
that's
all
it
does.
he
says
that's
okay
provided
its
motivation
is
to
defend
the
particular
alien.
but
if
it
has
an
ulterior
motive,
it
not
only
wants
to
win
the
case
for
the
alien
who
may
be
a
communist
or
a
non-communist
or
just
accused
of
being
a
communist,
but
it's
an
additional
one
to
win
the
case
for
the
alien
that
has
an
ulterior
motive.
it
isn't
even
a
motive
that
the
reason
we
want
to
help
this
alien
is
that
it
will
somehow
benefit
the
communist
party.
he
says
that
satisfies
the
aid
component.
that
just
sounds
to
me
to
be
thoroughly
outlandish
and
thoroughly
unconstitutional.
mr.
joseph
forer
well
--
mr.
joseph
forer
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
must
say
that
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
saying
the
same
thing
that
i
said
he'd
said.
the
reason
for
doing
this
laudable
activity
the
real
reason,
the
real
reason
is
to
help
the
communist
party.
that's
what
he's
saying
if
all
--
mr.
joseph
forer
well
--
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
i
--
if
i
misled
your
honor
by
the
use
of
the
word
ulterior,
i'm
sorry.
but
to
me,
when
you
talk
about
real
reasons
as
distinguished
from
the
actual
objective
fact
of
what
you're
doing,
that
relates
an
ulterior
motive.
now,
i
don't
want
to
quibble
on
the
use
of
that
word
ulterior.
now,
i
think
it
is
instructed
to
look
at
the
kind
of
evidence
that
the
government
relied
on
to
prove
for
this
real
reason
of
what
i
call
this
ulterior
motive.
and
i
have
spent
although
i
said
in
my
brief
the
whole
thing
is
so
thoroughly
thought
farfetched
and
so
repugnant
to
me
that
i
don't
think
we
even
have
to
examine
the
evidence.
i
attempted
in
my
brief
to
examine
every
evidentiary
finding
that
the
board
cited
and
supported
that.
and
i
must
say
that
it
is
simply
enough
--
it
aroused
my
indignation
and
i
really
think
that
the
whole
thing
is
an
outrage
to
put
it
bluntly.
it
consist
of
doing
things
like
putting
on
a
man
like
john
lautner
who
--
a
communist
who
turned
an
informer
and
professional
witness
in
the
pay
of
the
department
of
justice
who
knew
nothing
about
the
work
of
the
american
committee
for
the
protection
of
foreign
born
and
he
gives
it
as
his
opinion,
and
the
board
seriously
relies
on
this.
he
gives
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
purpose
of
the
american
committee
for
the
protection
of
foreign
born
is
to
defend
communists.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
doesn't
even
satisfy
his
definition
because
of
--
it
should
be,
it
should
have
been
--
mr.
wendell
willkie's
purpose
when
he
defended
mr.
schneiderman
--
to
defend
mr.
schneider.
and
i
may
say
also
that
either
standards
of
the
board
used
in
this
case
for
determining
this
ulterior
motive,
i
don't
think
mr.
willkie
would
have
been
so
well
off,
because
there's
evidence
in
this
record
that
mr.
willkie
not
only
defended
mr.
schneider,
and
in
the
course
of
that
as
a
lawyer,
it
was
his
obligation
within
the
area
of
his
professional
responsibility
to
accept
directions
from
his
client
to
be
was
going
to
represent
him
at
all.
but
i'll
tell
you
what
else
mr.
wendell
willkie
didas
it
appears
in
this
record.
he
wrote
a
letter
to
mr.
abner
green
the
executive
secretary
of
the
committee
the
--
that
war
of
the
government
and
he
said,
“dear
mr.
green,
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
think
you're
doing
a
great
job.
keep
up
with
this
work”.
and
he
didn't
have
to
do
that.
it
wasn't
essential
to
his
representation
of
william
schneiderman
and
that
is
the
kind
of
evidence
that
they
used
to
determine
this
--
but
i
won't
say
ulterior,
this
real
motive
and
this
kind
of
thing
that
you
inevitably
get
into
if
you
go
around
determining
real
motive
by
something
other
than
the
objective
nature
of
their
activities.
mr.
joseph
forer
now,
so
far
--
now,
may
i
just
say
this
one
thing
about
my
--
sure.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
was
one
of
the
counsels
for
the
communist
party
in
that
case,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
forer
well
of
course
it
is,
of
course
it
is.
mr.
joseph
forer
oh,
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
i
take
non-deviation.
in
the
communist
party
case
they're
big
--
they're
a
big
deal
leaving
aside
this
pre-1940
evidence
about
the
communist
international
but
the
big
deal
was
this
evidence
in
non-deviation.
and
justice
frankfurter
have
said,
“look,
they
agreed
what
the
soviet
union
over
a
best
variety
of
topics
over
--
over
all
the
years
of
their
existence
in
regardless
of
twist
and
turns”
and
that
was
the
big
deal
in
the
communist
party
case
so
the
board
here
makes
a
finding
in
non-deviation.
do
you
know
what
it's
based
on?
it
said
the
american
committee
for
protection
of
foreign
born
is
opposed
to
political
deportations
and
political
denaturalization
as
well
as
every
other
kind
and
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
is
also
and
this
i
suppose
is
a
sinister
opposed
the
statute
for
the
deporting
of
communists.
and
that's
the
basis
of
their
finding
at
non-deviation.
now,
talking
about
funds,
there's
no
suggestion
here
and
no
evidence
here
that
the
american
committee
made
any
profits
from
this.
in
fact
anybody
that
--
you
could
read
directly,
the
idea
that
made
any
profits
is
really
fantastic
or
that
they
ever
gave
a
single
penny
to
the
communist
party
or
that
they
had
misappropriated
funds.
and
thought
about
concealment
in
getting
money
from
non-communist,
how
any
person
who
gave
money
to
the
american
committee
could
have
been
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
the
american
committee
would
very
likely
use
that
money
to
defend
among
others
people
accused
of
being
communist
including
people
as
to
whom
the
accusation
even
happen
to
be
right,
in
anyone
could
believe
that
their
money
was
not
being
used
for
that
purpose
is
inconceivable.
they
would
have
to
be
deaf,
dumb,
and
blind.
mr.
joseph
forer
no,
it's
not
the
whole
record,
but
if
you
read
the
findings
of
the
board
with
any
perception,
their
findings
demonstrate
how
hollow
their
thing
is.
and
my
brief
takes
up
their
findings
and
does
it
in
terms
--
some
of
their
findings
are
sheer
inventions
like
the
invention
that
was
made
in
the
government's
brief
about
the
international
labor
defense.
mr.
joseph
forer
what?
mr.
joseph
forer
i
don't
think
you
have
to
go
to
the
evidence.
mr.
joseph
forer
i
think
so.
there
are
very
few
instances
where
you
have
to
go
the
evidence
and
where
you
do,
i
quote
the
evidence.
mr.
joseph
forer
well,
i
think
the
findings
on
that
face
sir
are
quite
absurd.
mr.
joseph
forer
you
can
look
at
their
findings
of
the
evidence
and
even
on
their
own
doctored
version
of
the
evidence.
their
findings,
their
evidentiary
findings
are
insufficient
to
support
their
conclusory
findings.
mr.
joseph
forer
it's
here,
now
i
imagine
it's
a
big
record,
it's
very
--
it's
big.
it's
big
there's
a
--
awful
lot
of
stuff
in
there
that's
about
nothing
but
it's
a
big
record.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes.
mr.
joseph
forer
yes,
and
may
i
say
--
and
may
i
say
about
that.
in
the
first
place,
the
board
relied
on
that
for
its
control
findings
and
if
you
analyze
it
carefully
you
will
see
that
that's
all
that
it
has
to
do
with
it.
in
the
second
place,
this
episode
which
--
which
was
flatly
contradicted
by
abner
green
although
you
couldn't
tell
it
from
the
boards,
a
version
the
court
admitted
that
it
is
flatly
contradicted.
even
if
you
believe
that
this
episode
happened.
in
the
first
place
according
to
lautner,
it
happened
at
neither
1941
and
1942
which
is
10
years
or
11
years
before
the
beginning
of
the
critical
period.
in
the
second
place,
it
is
still
doesn't
indicate
why
he
was
picked
--
or
why
the
communist
party
preferred
him
over
another
candidate.
and
that
there
are
other
objections,
allow
me
to
specify.
so
far
as
the
aid
component
is
concerned,
they
rely
on
lautner's
opinion
testimony.
now,
lautner
may
have
been
an
expert
on
the
communist
party,
he
was
no
expert
on
the
american
committee.
i'd
like
to
say
one
other
thing
which
is
really
prompted
by
a
remark
that
mr.
justice
goldberg
made
earlier.
the
fact
that
i
fairly
touched
on
the
control
of
component
doesn't
mean
that
i
think
that
we
have
a
weak
case
on
the
control
of
component.
it's
just
that
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
points
here
that
could
be
argued
and
for
purposes
of
oral
argument,
i
just
had
to
be
very
selective
to
the
point
where
i
couldn't
really
say
much
about
the
controller
component.
but
i
would
like
to
give
you
one
example,
not
because
of
the
evidence
itself
but
it's
an
example
of
what
you
face
when
you
get
this
kind
of
a
case.
one
of
the
big
items
that
the
court
of
appeals
singled
out
is
evidence
singled
out
is
evidence
of
control
is
that
the
american
committee
in
1952
referred
to
three
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
alien
field
and
said
that
those
decisions
were
terrible,
they
destroyed
democratic
rights
and
this
court
has
deserted
its
duty
to
protect
the
bill
of
rights.
and
you
know
what
was
the
special
sinister
is
that
the
daily
worker
all
said
similar
things
about
two
of
the
decisions.
now,
those
decisions
were
carlson
against
landon
which
upheld
the
right
of
the
attorney
general
to
hold
aliens
choose
to
be
a
communist
and
deportation
proceedings
without
bail,
harisiades
against
landon
which
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
retroactive
communist
deportation
statute
and
the
spector
case
which
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
self
deportation
law
though
very
narrow.
in
each
of
those
--
each
of
those
cases
was
sponsored
by
the
american
committee.
and
as
a
disappointed
litigant,
i
think
it
had
the
judicial
right
of
disappointed
litigants
to
go
to
the
tavern
and
curse
out
the
judge.
but
what
the
court
overlooked
in
its
hurry
to
see
what
the
daily
worker
said
was
what
the
dissenters
said
about
those
opinions.
justice
black
in
the
carlson
case
said
that
the
majority
showed
a
shocking
disregard
of
the
provisions
of
the
bill
of
rights.
justice
douglas
in
harisiades
case
said
that
the
majority
was
repudiating
the
traditions
of
--
which
underlay
the
bill
of
rights
and
i
won't
take
time
to
quote
--
but
justices
jackson
and
frankfurter
didn't
think
very
much
of
the
majority
opinion
in
the
spector
case.
the
point
is
that
you
get
a
situation
where
--
where
the
courts
are
beguiled
by
this
pseudo-historical
discussion
about
in
the
abstract,
about
the
menace
of
communism,
some
communist-front
though
who
raises
and
gives
money
to
the
party,
it
does
things
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
record,
and
the
court
gets
so
beguiled
by
this
theoretical
abstract
concept
that
it
just
departs
from
its
responsibility
to
review
the
record
in
the
light
of
the
evidence
in
the
way
the
court
is
supposed
to
review
the
record.
and
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
thank
you.
