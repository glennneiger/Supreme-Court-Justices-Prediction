mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
a
federal
statute.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
it
is
limited
to
the
registration
provisions
with
--
it
is
only
the
registration
provisions
which
are
before
the
court
and
not
any
of
the
disabilities
either
as
they
apply
to
the
organization
or
to
the
members.
these
provisions
do
not
prohibit
petitioner
from
doing
anything,
they
do
require
the
board
to
make
a
finding
as
to
the
character
of
the
organization
and
if
it
finds
the
organization
to
be
a
communist-front
as
defined
in
the
act
to
require
it
to
disclose
its
officers
and
to
make
a
financial
accounting.
in
considering
the
issues
in
this
case,
the
government
believes
that
it
is
crucial
to
understand
the
nature
of
communist-fronts
and
their
relationship
to
the
world
communist
movement.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
am
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
was
the
hold
--
that
was
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
communist
party
case,
that
provisions
here
are
almost
identical.
they
certainly
are
analogous
and
the
relationship
between
the
disabilities
or
sanctions
and
the
registration
provisions
is
identical.
in
our
brief,
in
the
appendices,
we
described
in
considerable
length,
the
nature
of
communist-fronts.
i
will
not
go
into
it
in
great
detail
but
i
think
it
is
important
to
summarize
the
nature
of
these
fronts
here.
after
the
soviet
revolution
according
to
communist
theory,
it
was
expected
that
there
would
be
armed
revolutions
in
all
capitalist
countries.
but
this
expectation
turned
out
to
be
incorrect
because
the
workers
turned
out
not
to
be
so
eager
to
overthrow
their
governments.
therefore,
the
communist
leaders
in
the
soviet
union
and
their
theoreticians
decided
to
attempt
to
win
the
allegiances
to
the
workers,
as
well
as
of
other
groups
more
gradually
than
advocating
and
solely
advocating
armed
revolution.
they
did
this
not
so
much
by
changing
the
views
of
the
communist
parties
which
continued
to
support
armed
revolution.
but
rather
by
infiltrating,
and
if
possible,
controlling
formally
non-communist
organizations
in
all
kinds
of
different
fields,
workers,
farmers,
veterans,
ethnic
groups,
and
the
like,
and
if
they
were
unsuccessful
in
doing
this
to
set
up
new
organizations
to
perform
these
tasks.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
your
honor,
its
not.
this
is
the
kind
of
evidence
that
was
before
the
congress
in
enacting
the
statute.
now,
the
congress
found
what
a
communist-front
was
and
therefore
the
evidence
that
was
before
the
board
was
just
evidence
which
went
to
the
character
of
the
american
committee
itself.
in
other
words,
the
board
of
course
has
no
power
to
go
beneath
it
and
determine
anew
whether
the
communist-fronts
are
in
fact
dangerous.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there
was
a
tendency,
it
seems
to
me
in
listening
to
petitioner's
counsel
here
and
in
its
brief
to
consider
communist-fronts
as
a
completely
benign
organizations
he
repeatedly
said.
it
is
an
organization
that
does
no
more
than
defend
people,
which
of
course
is
perfectly,
as
he
insists,
a
laudable
objective.
what
we
are
trying
to
do,
what
i',
trying
to
do
now
is
to
put
these
provisions
in
the
context
of
the
communist
movement,
which
is
what
congress
was
dealing
with
in
the
internal
security
act.
one
scholar
has
pointed
out
that
with
the
aid
of
--
with
100
communist
members,
it
is
possible
to
control
an
organization
of
a
150,000
people.
that
communist
control
of
these
organizations
was
not
revealed
because
if
the
communist
control
was
revealed
non-communist
would
be
scared
away.
and
these
organizations
utilized
popular
causes,
good
causes,
higher
wages,
better
working
conditions
are
positioned
to
fascism
and
the
like.
but
these
causes
were
not
the
ultimate
objective
of
the
communist
party
members
who
control
the
organizations.
their
ultimate
objective,
which
they
did
not
directly
advocate
within
these
organizations,
was
forcible
overthrow
of
the
government
of
a
particular
country
in
which
they
were
operating.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
that's
exactly
what
i
was
going
to
point
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
to
you,
your
honor,
what
communist
purpose
was
served
by
having
these
organizations
at
all.
why
have
separate
organizations
from
the
communist
party.
well,
there's
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
they
want
to
propagandize
far
marginal
numbers
of
people
than
they
could
through
the
communist
party.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor
there
are
great
many
issues
that
aren't
quite
so
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
in
two
different
pockets
there.
you
can
propagandize
people
towards
economic
measures,
to
move
closer
and
closer
to
communist
dogma.
when
they
get
close
enough
then
the
person
they
hope
will
say,
well,
really
this
--
i've
been
in
favor
of
communist
dogma
all
along.
the
whole
piece
in
the
long
run,
the
people
will
either
become
communist
party
members
in
this
method
and
this
of
course
does
happen
or
at
least
that
they
will
consider
communism
not
a
serious
menace.
now,
the
second
reason
is
that
they
hoped
to
get
people
non-communists
to
support
positions
even
though
they
are
not
communist
party
members
that
are
taken
by
the
soviet
union
or
by
the
communist
parties.
now,
they
did
this
in
their
--
in
the
soviet
peace
crusade
after
world
war
ii,
they
set
up
various
peace
organizations
throughout
the
world
in
order
to
get
as
many
people
to
support
soviet
views
then
hopefully
the
democratic
governments
would
reflect
the
positions
of
these
people.
the
number
of
people
in
the
communist
party
might
be
very,
very
much
less.
the
third
reason
is
that
these
communist-led
organizations
often
provide
support
to
the
communist
party.
now,
this
may
be
financial,
they
may
take
you
in
a
great
deal
of
additional
money
more
than
they
spent
or
they
may
provide
services,
that's
exactly
what
we
allege.
but
the
government
alleges
and
what
the
government
believes
that
is
proved,
the
american
committee
did
it.
it
was
the
way
of
the
communist
party
defending
its
members
through
funds
contributed
by
non-communist
and
the
non-communist
did
not
know
that
the
organization
they
were
contributing
to
was
in
fact
controlled
by
the
communist
party.
and
fourth,
these
communist-led
organizations
play
an
important
role
when
and
if
the
time
ever
comes
for
armed
revolution
before
--
immediately
before
revolution,
they
may
join
in
united
fronts,
this
was
done
in
the
30's
throughout
most
of
europe
and
in
those
united
fronts
they
try
to
cause
chaos
and
turmoil
and
both
in
the
society
and
in
the
government.
when
the
revolution
actually
cursed,
they
may
attempt
to
make
the
organization
actually
back
the
revolution
or
else
be
neutral
to
it.
now,
what
i'd
been
talking
about
sounds
extremely
theoretical
and
unreal.
the
appendices
to
our
brief
indicate
that
for
some
40
years
this
is
exactly
what
the
communist
party
has
been
doing
this
country
--
in
this
country
and
throughout
the
world.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
at
least
they
didn't
think
it
was
unreal
but
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
they
thought
they
were
accomplishing
something
by
it.
and
how
much
they've
accomplished?
i
suppose
they
haven't
accomplished
enough
in
all
the
democratic
governments
that
haven't
been
overthrown.
but
the
fact
is
that
there
are
two
examples
of
where
this
method
was
extremely
important
to
communist
overthrow
of
the
government
and
that
were
within
the
two
coup
d'etats
in
czechoslovakia
and
in
hungary.
unfortunately
the
government's
brief
does
not
describe
the
use
of
the
fronts
in
these
two
very
specific
instances
in
detail.
but
they
are
described
in
several
books
and
articles
which
are
cited
by
mr.
justice
jackson
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
dennis
case.
and
these
books
and
articles
by
scholars
indicate
just
how
communist-fronts
form
an
extremely
vital
role
in
the
actual
revolution
when
and
if
that
time
ever
comes.
now
i'd
like
to
turn
more
specifically
to
this
statute
and
how
it
fits
into
the
pattern
of
the
communist
theory
and
practice
which
i've
just
described.
section
2
(7)
--
section
2
of
that
act
describes
the
world
communist
movement
in
considerable
detail.
subsection
7
describes
communist-fronts
as
being
created
and
maintained.
in
order
to
obtain
financial
and
other
support
from
people
who
would
not
normally
give
their
support
to
the
communist
activities,
and
congress
found
that
these
fronts
conceal
their
true
character
and
their
purposes.
now,
the
act
then
defines
in
section
3
(4)
what
a
communist-front
is.
and
essentially,
insofar
as
it's
relevant
here,
it
says
that
a
communist-front
is
first
controlled
by
a
communist-action
organization,
here
at
the
communist
party
and
second
that
it
has
the
purpose
of
carrying
--
of
giving
aid
and
support,
the
primary
purpose
of
giving
aid
and
support
to
the
communist-action
organization,
here
at
the
communist
party.
now,
communist-action
organizations
in
turn
are
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
would
not
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
wouldn't
even
come
close
to
being
under
the
actuary.
there
are
two
reasons
why,
its
purpose
has
to
be
not
ballet.
its
purpose
has
to
be
that
it
is
trying
to
further
there
is
the
communist
party
or
the
soviet
union
or
the
world
communist
movement.
that
has
to
be
its
purpose,
not
ballet.
but
even
if
passing
that,
it
has
to
be
an
organization
which
is
controlled
by
the
communist
party.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
wouldn't
be
(voice
overlap)
controlling
your
honor,
that
would
not
be
controlled.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
would
not
be
a
communist-front,
that's
right
your
honor.
control
has
--
has
to
be
and
is
shown
by
all
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
and
more
specifically
by
this
case.
it
has
to
be
that
the
people
that
run
the
organization
are
active
party
members.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
they're
acting
under
instructions
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
here
we
have
testimony
that
the
petitioner's
offices
were
killing
out
the
policies
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
and
the
purpose
of
this
organization
was
to
bolster
the
prestige
of
the
soviet
union.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
if
i
can
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
if
i
can
rephrase
your
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
your
hypothetical.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
would
be
a
communist-front.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
if
you
have
a
purpose
of
bolstering
the
soviet
union
and
it
would
at
the
same
time
be
controlled
by
the
communist
party,
that's
right.
those
are
two
are
the
two
things.
now,
you
have
to
be
controlled
by
a
communist-action
organization,
it
operates
primarily
for
the
purpose
of
giving
aid
and
support
to
the
communist-action
organization
that
were
--
the
foreign
government
controlling
the
communist
--
a
communist-foreign
government
or
the
communist
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
are
--
and
one
of
the
things
is
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
somehow,
that
we've
--
there's
--
we
should
make
a
game
out
of
being
--
whether
there
should
be
a
communist-front.
if
you're
a
communist-front
you've
got
to
do
something.
congress
thinks
that
that
makes
you
a
danger,
if
you
are
not
a
danger,
presumably
it
won't
be
a
communist-front.
i
mean
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
that
broader
ambit.
there
had
been
14
organizations
that
have
been
found
by
the
board
to
be
communist-fronts.
i
think
50,
one
of
the
members
found
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
not
be
a
communist-front.
so
there'd
been
14
organizations
in
which
the
findings,
i
believe
had
been
upheld.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there
be
many
organizations
controlled
by
the
communist
party
that
aren't
doing
something
in
order
to
help
the
communist
party,
that's
the
reason
they've
got
controlled.
now
a
writ
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor
there
was
a
time
let
me
say
there
--
there
was
an
order
between
the
two.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
now
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
your
honor
because
they
didn't
want
an
organization,
there
might
be
a
few
examples
on
which
it
wouldn't
be
doing
anything.
primarily,
a
member
can't
be
just
--
can't
be
an
incidental
thing.
there
were
--
in
which
you
would
not
be
primarily
helping
the
communist
party.
there
might
--
it
might
be
--
in
other
words
if
it's
–
if
it
just
control
that
turns
out
to
really
be
benign
in
the
--
in
the
--
in
congress'
sense,
in
not
giving
any
aid,
there's
no
reason
to
make
it
register.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
the
congress
(voice
overlap)
didn't
find
it
benign
to
be
--
to
be
helping
the
communist
party
in
any
way.
when
i
say
benign,
it's
saying
that
it
really
wasn't
interested
in
ballet.
there
were
no
people
in
the
communist
party
that
liked
ballet,
that
they
just
thought
they
were
--
they
wanted
to
have
some
of
the
great
ballet
companies
to
come
to
the
united
states
and
the
soviet
was
obviously
one
of
them,
then
it
would
not
have
to
register.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
no
control.
it
has
to
have
the
purpose
of
helping
a
communist-foreign
government,
the
soviet
union.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor
i
--
i
can't
say
what
it
would
argue
but,
definitively
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
it's
not
good
enough
that
it
does
in
fact
aid.
it
is
not
--
and
that
would
--
and
i
may
say
that
that
is
why
the
cramp
case
is
not
at
all
in
point.
it
isn't
enough
that
you
--
wendell
willkie
does
not
have
--
would
not
have
to
register,
the
fact
that
somebody
does
aid
the
communist
party
does
not
require
it
to
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
even
if
controlled,
even
if
controlled,
it
has
to
have
a
purpose
of
aid
and
it's
not
enough
to
happen
to
give
aid.
in
other
words,
what
--
what
i'm
really
trying
to
say
here
is
that
congress
said
about
communist-fronts,
these
are
part
of
the
communist
party.
they've
been
split-off
in
order
to
attract
non-communists.
but
they're
not
really
split-off.
they're
subsidiaries
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
sure.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
i
was
going
to
come
to
that
specific
intention
a
little
later
but
since
i
think
it's
the
only
serious
non-constitutional
argument
which
is
before
the
court,
the
others
in
our
view
are
really
quibbles
about
minor
bits
of
evidence
and
normally
nobody
would
even
argue
here.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
it
is
in
the
brief
but
even
--
and
i'm
talking
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
too
under
the
aid
component
as
opposed
the
statutory
construction.
most
of
these
points
would
not
even
normally
find
their
way
to
this
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
i
think
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
it
applied
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
well,
your
honor,
i
know
the
petitioner
makes
much
of
the
fact
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i'm
arguing
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i'm
arguing,
your
honor
that
you
have
to
have
the
purpose
of
aiding
the
communist
party.
now,
there
is
a
dispute
what
you
actually
have
to
aid
in
addition.
petitioner
says
that
you
should
read
the
statute
as
requiring
not
just
purpose
but
actual
aid.
the
government's
reply
to
that
is
that
seems
inconsistent
with
the
statute
but
it's
not
important
to
this
case
because
both
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
both
purpose
and
actual
aid.
so
for
purposes
--
on
the
purposes
of
this
case,
we
would
assume
there
has
to
be
both
a
purpose
of
aiding
the
communist
party
as
such
not
to
just
do
what
an
act
which
turns
out
to
be
aid
and
actual
aid
to
the
communist
party.
and
we
think
the
evidence
supports
both.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
your
honor.
and
constant
--
and
activities
which
are
protected
which
would
come
within
the
ambit
of
the
first
amendment.
i
may
say
this
is
nothing
very
strange
that
the
foreign
agents
registration
act
normally
applies
to
activities
which
are
within
the
ambit
of
the
--
of
the
first
amendment.
so
does
the
--
our
federal
regulation
of
lobbying
act.
and
other
statutes
which
require
a
disclosure
so
that
we
don't
--
we
don't
think
this
is
anything
very
noble
that
we're
saying,
and
after
all
what
we're
talking
about
here
--
and
we're
not
talking
about
the
disabilities,
we're
talking
about
disclosing.
first
of
all
the
board
finding
the
character
of
an
organization
telling
the
people
that
--
of
the
country
that
this
is
--
is
this
kind
of
organization
so
that
they
are
not
deceived.
and
second
of
all
requiring
disclosure,
the
kind
of
disclosure
that
was
--
that
existed
in
the
federal
regulation
of
lobbying
act
and
in
several
other
federal
statutes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
if
there
--
your
honor's
question
suggest
and
it
is
of
course
quite
true
that
if
we
are
to
consider
here
all
the
disabilities,
this
statute
with
the
disabilities
is
quite
different
than
federal
regulation
of
lobbying
act,
there's
no
doubt
about
that,
i
wouldn't
--
i
wouldn't
suggest
that
contrary
for
a
moment.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
nothing
your
honor.
what
i
--
that
would
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
your
honor.
because
it
seems
to
us
that
the
communist
party
case
establishes
that
we
are
not
to
look
to
the
disabilities
now.
that
those
would
be
litigated
individually.
i
may
say
the
aptheker
case
as
an
example
of
litigation
of
them
and
maybe
that
there
will
be
other
provisions
that
will
not
be
constitutional
but
each
one
of
those
will
have
to
be
examined
on
its
own
merits.
that
is,
in
our
view,
was
the
teaching
of
the
communist
party
case
and
it's
perfectly
clear.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor
it
didn't
reached
that,
but
of
course,
it
recognize
that
it
could
happen.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
it
--
your
honor
it
did
not
consider
the
fifth
amendment
questions
on
whether
they
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh
no,
they
--
they're
in
the
same
position
as
the
communist
party
was
when
it
came
to
this
--
when
it
came
to
this
court
in
the
communist
party
case.
they're
in
exactly
the
same
position.
there's
an
outstanding
order
that
they
register,
that
was
exactly
the
position
of
the
communist
party
when
it
came
to
this
court.
there's
no
difference
at
all
in
the
posture
of
the
two
cases.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
how
many
organizations?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes
your
honor.
there
are
--
then
of
course,
the
next
case
involves
an
additional
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
pardon
me?
yes,
it's
--
there's
just
one
included
in
this.
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i'd
like
to
return
--
return
to
--
return
to
your
question
about
what
the
aid
component
of
the
act
really
means.
now,
first
of
all,
looking
just
at
the
aid
component
itself,
all
it
says
is
that
the
government
must
show
that
organization
has
the
purpose
of
giving
aid.
it
does
not
say
that
there
has
to
be
any
particular
kind
of
aid.
on
its
face,
it
would
seem
to
include
any
kind
of
aid
which
would
in
--
and
certainly
nobody
could
deny,
i
would
think,
that
defending
party
members
aids
the
communist
party.
then
in
addition,
section
2
(7)
describes
what
communist-fronts
are
like.
and
this
finding
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
defending
--
defending
a
communist
party
member
aids
the
communist
party.
it
may
do
many
other
things,
your
honor.
it
may
do
many
other
things
that
are
very
laudable
but
it
does
do
that
one
thing.
i'm
not
suggesting
it's
a
bad
thing
to
do
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
pardon
me?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
defend
them
in
the
courts
or
before
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
i
--
i'm
not
suggesting
that
this
is
a
bad
thing
for
a
person
to
do.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
it
does
amokong
other
things
aid
the
communist
party.
every
additional
communist
party
member
who
stays
in
the
unites
states
presumably
helps
the
communist
party.
at
least,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
this
record
shows
that
the
communist
party
thinks
so.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
don't
think
your
honor
that
this
court
should
really
make
the
decision
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
between
--
which
is
the
ultimate
thing
that
aids
democracy
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
more
or
the
communist
party
more.
i
understand
that
there's
a
--
that
one
could
argue
very
persuasively
that
providing
a
good
defense
through
those
administrative
and
judicial
review
that
this
really
helps
democracy.
but
the
point,
the
point
that
i'm
making
is
that
i
don't
think
--
i
think
for
the
purpose
of
the
statute
that
this
was
aiding
the
communist
party,
more
members
they
hope
will
be
in
this
country.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
outset
i'd
like
to
point
out
an
error
in
the
government's
brief.
the
government
does
not
now
claim
that
the
board
found
the
petitioner
actually
arose
on
the
international
legal
defense
in
1932
or
1933,
this
--
an
organization
which
had
its
headquarters
in
moscow.
while
there
was
considerable
evidence
indicating
this
fact,
we
have
overlooked
contrary
evidence
and
we
think,
as
the
petitioner
thinks,
that
the
board
deliberately
did
not
resolve
this
conflict
in
the
evidence.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
it
appears
in
the
statement
we
put
--
but
it
also
appears
at
various
points
during
the
discussion
of
the
evidentiary
questions
in
several
places.
but
it's
--
i
think
it's
first
on
page
4
and
the
footnote
on
page
4
is
where
our
reasoning,
yes
in
our
brief,
it's
where
our
reasoning
was.
the
board
clearly
didn't
explicitly
find
it
and
we
thought
that
it
had
implicitly
found
it
and
we
agree
with
the
petitioner
that
probably
even
that
is
not
so.
now,
i'd
like
you
to
turn
to
mr.
justice
goldberg's
question
yesterday
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
aid
component
of
the
statute
more
explicitly
whether
it
requires
directly
aimed
at
forcible
overthrow
of
the
government
or
advocating
forcible
overthrow
of
the
government.
i
think
i
mentioned
yesterday
that
we
started
from
the
proposition
that
section
3
(4)
on
its
face
strongly
looks
the
government's
way
because
it
says
that
all
the
government
need
to
show,
to
show
that
an
organization
is
a
communist-front
is
that
it
operates
primarily
for
the
purpose
of
giving
aid
and
support
to
a
communist-action
organization,
a
communist
party.
on
its
face,
all
that
it
requires
is
aid
and
support
and
not
aid
and
support
of
any
particular
kind
of
or
for
any
particular
purpose
of
the
communist-action
organization.
and
this
is
supported
by
section
2
(7)
which
describes
communist-fronts
as
organizations
which
conceal
the
facts
as
to
their
true
character
and
their
purpose
in
order
to
obtain
support
from
persons
who
would
not
otherwise
give
it.
we
think
it's
quite
clear
that
if
it
was
directly
aiding
overthrow
of
the
government
or
advocating
overthrow
of
the
government,
not
many
non-communists
would
be
in
any
doubt
as
to
the
control
of
the
organization
or
to
its
purpose
and
therefore
it
would
not
fulfill
this
description.
now,
petitioner
points
to
the
beginning,
the
first
phrase
of
2
(7)
that
says,
well
the
reason
that
the
communist-action
organization
is
doing
this,
setting
up
communist-fronts
as
to
aid
its
objectives
under
section
2
(6)
and
these
are
forcible
overthrow
of
the
government.
well,
that's
of
course
exactly
the
point
that
i
was
making
yesterday.
but
this
is
exactly
why
they
setup
communist-fronts
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
communist-fronts
themselves
advocate
overthrow
of
the
government
or
directly
aid
overthrow
of
the
government.
they
do
other
more
immediate
things.
and
i
think
this
is
if
--
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
is
extremely
lengthy,
but
i
think
out
of
the
reading
of
the
--
the
both
--
both
the
testimony
of
the
congressional
hearings
and
the
debate
on
the
floor
of
congress
on
the
prompt
provisions
is
quite
clear
that
what
they
were
aiming
at
is
organizations
which
are
seemingly
harmless
that
seem
like
the
organizations
defending
the
bill
of
rights
or
civil
liberties
or
the
rights
of
farmers
or
labor
but
in
fact
are
controlled
by
the
communist
party
and
are
in
fact
are
aiding
it.
there's
no
indication
whatsoever
that
as
to
communist-fronts,
they
are
--
that
the
--
that
congress
believed
that
they
directly
advocated
overthrow
of
the
government.
and
i
may
say
that
that
distinction
is
also
clear
in
the
committee
report
which
petitioner's
counsel
cited
to
you
yesterday.
all
that
says
is
that
the
congress
was
not
aiming
a
mere
theoretical
problem.
it
was
aiming
at
a
problem
that
was
a
serious
danger
to
this
country.
of
course
that
--
and
that
again
is
exactly
what
i
was
trying
to
say
yesterday
that
if
the
communist
party
was
just
interested
in
abstract
marxism,
the
statute
would
not
have
been
passed.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
you
would.
i
think,
an
argue
could
have
been
made
if
the
communist-fronts
provisions
weren't
in
the
statute
at
all.
that
the
definition
of
organization
in
the
statute
is
so
broad
that
it
could
have
covered
communist-fronts.
the
difficulty
is
that
i
think
it's
quite
clear
by
putting
in
communist-fronts
that
the
congress
wanted
to
deal
with
this
type
of
organization
under
the
communist-front
provisions.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
even
the
name
itself,
that's
right,
that's
the
name
itself.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
that
of
course
is
what
2
(7)
describes
the
front
as
--
now
i
may
say
that
--
and
this
is
what
i
was
coming
to
--
if,
if
the
petitioner's
argument
is
accepted,
the
front
provisions
will
be
completely
wiped
out
of
the
statute.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
by
definition?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but
that
isn't
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
but
it
didn't
add
anything
beyond
serving
the
purposes
of
the
communist
party,
that's
exactly
what
the
a
provision
says.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor
i
think
i
did
say
that
it
would
be
covered
if
its
purpose
was
to
--
was
to
aid
the
soviet
union.
it's
controlled
by
the
communist
party
and
aiding
the
soviet
union,
my
answer
was
that
it
is
covered.
if
it
--
if
he
has
an
interest
that's
ballet,
it
asked
the
soviet
ballet
company
in
the
united
states
and
the
danish
one
and
the
english
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
and
just
as
it
is
interest
is
ballet,
it
does
not
have
to
register,
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
that
was
what
they
said
they
were
interested
in
the
board
found
in
the
basis
of,
we
believe,
ample
evidence
and
i
like
to
get
to
that
evidence
on
just
how
we
did
deliberately
served
the
communist
party
in
a
moment
but
i
--
before
i
get
to
it,
i
like
to
point
out
that
if
the
petitioner's
argument
is
accepted,
there
will
be
no
more
communist-front
provisions
in
the
statute.
not
only
--
there
isn't
a
bit
of
evidence
in
this
record,
not
a
bit
and
we
wouldn't
ever
expect
them
that
they
were
advocating
overthrow
of
the
government,
or
that
they
were
directly
attempting
to
have
overthrow
of
the
government.
nor,
as
far
as
i
know
and
description
of
the
other
communist-front
cases
is
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief
has
any
one
of
the
other
organizations
ever
done
any
of
these
things
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
no,
no.
they
in
fact
are
not
doing
it.
in
fact,
they
do
not
advocate
overthrow
of
the
government
in
these
organizations
or
directly
aid
overthrow
of
the
government.
they
do
not,
your
honor.
that
--
to
the
extent
that
the
communist
party
does
those
things,
it
does
it
itself.
there's
no
need
to
have
separate
organizations
to
directly
do
those
things.
when
it
wants
to
conceal
these
purposes
then
it
sets
up
the
subsidiaries.
in
order
to
deceive
non-communists
to
support
various
communist
positions
which
on
their
face
do
not
directly
relate
to
overthrow
of
the
government.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
your
honor
because,
and
again
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
then
we
have
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
that's
right
your
honor
and
if
i
don't
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
the
congress
said
that
--
and
i
think
this
is
quite
clear
as
to
what
the
congress
was
doing
--
the
congress
said
if
you're
controlled
by
the
communist
party
and
you're
deliberately
aiding
the
communist
party,
you
are
the
communist
party
despite
any
fictional
lines
that
are
drawn
between
the
two.
in
the
corporate
field
nobody
would
have
any
difficulty
seeing
that
you
treat
the
two
organizations
the
same.
that's
--
we're
saying
that
congress
did
exactly
that.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
they
would
be
covered.
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
quite
--
that's
quite
right,
your
honor.
i
mean
and
it
is
a
--
i'd
like
to
return,
however,
that
that's
also
true
in
the
foreign
agents
registration
act
and
federal
regulation
of
lobbying
act
and
other
statutes
in
which
the
matter
is
perfectly
legal
and
protected,
in
the
area
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
what
was
their
purpose,
your
honor?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
they
would
have
to
register,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
return
to
the
purpose
of
what
it
was.
if
it
insists
those
--
those
facts,
you'd
still
have
to
look
for
the
purpose.
it
isn't
enough
just
to
happen
to
aid
the
communist
party,
that's
why
cramp
and
baggett
cases
are
not
important.
it's
not
enough
just
to
perform
an
act
that
somebody
can
say
is
a
vague.
you
have
to
have
that
purpose.
you
have
to
be
doing
it
deliberately.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
that
it's
very
possible
that
you
also
have
the
--
have
to
have
the
objective
fact.
we
don't
think
that
has
to
be
reached
here
because
both
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
they
were
actually
aiding
the
communist
party.
but
you
at
least
have
to
have
the
subjective
fact.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
(voice
overlap).
and
insofar
as
we
talked
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
no,
it
would
not
be
covered.
and
the
purpose
of
this,
in
your
terms
your
honor,
is
to
disclose
what
are
the
facts
insofar
as
we're
talking
here.
we're
not
talking
about
the
disabilities.
the
purpose
is
to
disclose
the
facts.
now,
let
me
point
to
what
--
what
are
the
facts
that
the
board
found
the
evidence
shows
concerning
petitioner's
aims.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
there
would
be
a
number
of
--
there
would
be
the
number
of
questions,
your
honor.
the
first
one
that
occurs
to
me
is
does
this
man
control
the
law
firm?
his
word
decides
everything
that
occurs
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
in
it
or
is
it,
you
know
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
a
partnership
in
which
they
discuss
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
controls
it
and
the
purpose
is
to
defend
communists.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
the
act
doesn't
apply
to
individuals.
you'd
have
to
make
a
finding
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
to
see
that
the
purpose
of
the
law
firm
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no
they
can
be
unincorporated
association.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
if
the
purpose
of
the
law
firm,
not
the
purpose
of
the
dominating
partner,
but
the
purpose
of
the
law
firm,
of
course
you
can
look
to
his
purpose.
the
purpose
of
the
law
firm
is
to
aid
the
communist
party
and
that
is
its
purpose,
yes
it
has
to
register.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it's
not
enough
your
honor
to
be
paid
to
represent
communists.
if
you
had
--
the
purpose
of
the
law
firm
has
to
be
to
aid
the
communist
party.
in
other
words,
wendell
--
as
i
said
yesterday,
wendell
willkie
was
paid,
i
suppose,
or
maybe
he
did
it
for
nothing
but
he
could
very
well
have
been
paid
by
mr.
schneiderman
to
represent
him.
now,
his
law
firm
didn't
have
to
register
even
though
somebody
could
say
that
he
--
that
he
was
aiding
the
communist
party.
he
has
the
purpose
that's
his
purpose.
it
is
subjective
as
well
as
objective.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
true.
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
chief
justice
and
i
--
i
think
we're
--
we're
taking
it
as
a
hypothetical,
that
this
law
firm
was
controlled
through
employing
this
man.
he
was
employed
by
the
communist
party
to
do
this
job.
let
me
turn
to
what
the
evidence
is
of
--
the
purpose
of
what
the
petitioner
was
doing
and
its
purpose.
it
was
not
to
defend
civil
rights.
first
of
all,
there's
the
objective
factor.
a
very
large
proportion
of
its
--
of
its
--
the
people
suit,
cases
it
handled
involved
communism
or
some
other
type
of
subversion
or
some
dispute
whether
it's
10%
or
50%,
it's
a
very
large
proportion
far
more
than
the
proportion
of
subversion
cases
and
the
deportation
cases
generally.
in
addition,
the
petitioner
--
again,
this
is
the
objective
fact,
it
advocated
repeal
of
many
of
these
statutes.
nothing
i
said
is
anything
wrong
with
doing
this.
now,
the
communist
party
used
these
facts
in
order
to
show
that
it's
purportedly
non-communist
organization
was
defending
communist
party
members
and
protesting
harassment
by
the
government
of
the
communist
party.
now,
why
did
the
petitioner
do
this?
did
he
do
it
--
i
suppose
everything
that
i
have
said,
the
american
civil
liberties
union
also
has
done.
a
witness
testified
who
was
a
party
to
the
choosing
of
the
chief
officer
of
petitioner.
the
petitioner
--
two
leading
officers
deliberately
carried
out
the
policies
of
the
communist
party
and
running
petitioner.
another
witness
testified
that
the
third
leading
officer
of
the
petitioner
was
acting
for
the
communist
party
when
she
was
an
officer
of
petitioner.
a
local
branch
of
petitioner
was
setup
because
of
the
discussions
by
the
communist
party
that
it
had
to
have
an
organization
to
defend
party
members
against
deportation.
it
was
setup
by
--
this
branch
was
setup
by
a
party
member
under
instructions
from
the
communist
party
to
do
this
and
then
later
on
this
person
became
the
chief
officer
of
the
branch.
two
other
branches
were
setup,
in
order
for
the
purpose
of
defending
party
members.
now,
it
seems
to
us
this
evidence
takenas
a
whole
establishes
not
the
petitioner
happened
to
defend
communists
because
he
was
interested
in
civil
liberties
but
because
he
was
deliberately
interested
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
i
think
the
record
is
not
showing
--
there
are
no
findings
of
the
board
to
that
effect.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
record
does
not
show
control
--
that
kind
of
control
over
the
national
organization
or
the
local
organization
and
the
board
made
no
findings
that
there
was
control
and
the
reason
it
did
not
do
so,
was
that
the
statute
section
3
(2)
of
the
statute
which
defines
the
organization
for
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
considerably
broader
than
that.
it
says
any
group
of
persons
whether
or
not
incorporated
permanently
or
temporarily
associated
together
for
joint
action.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
national
organization
or
local
organizations
were
tightly
woven
together
as
it
says
intermeshed.
i
could
point
you
all
kinds
of
evidence
to
this
fact.
i
suppose
the
most
damming
evidence
on
this
point
is
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
and
the
local
committee
said
in
their
own
publications
that
the
local
committees
were
a
part
of,
that's
their
own
phraseology
a
part
of
the
national
committee,
affiliated
with
the
national
committee.
whenever
petitioner
was
setting
fort
in
its
own
documents,
statistics
concerning
what
it
was
doing,
it
always
included
the
statistics
of
all
the
local
committees.
it
never
indicated
that
these
local
committees
were
separate.
i
don't
think
--
your
honor,
i
think
the
evidence
is
overwhelming
that
these
were
the
same
organization.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
i
must
--
the
reason
i'm
a
little
hesitant
to
answer
your
question
is
i'm
not
sure
of
all
the
tie-in
between
the
locals
and
the
national
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
as
far
as
--
the
reason
i'm
hesitant
to
answer
your
question
straight
out
is
that
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
sufficiently
aware
of
all
the
interrelationship
of
the
local
groups
within
the
national
legal
aid,
within
the
legal
aid
framework
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
with
the
national.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
the
evidence
is
quite
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh
no!
it
does
not
show
control
if
control
is
necessary,
control
was
not
shown
and
the
findings
of
the
board
are
not
supported.
if
that
is
what
is
required,
your
honor,
there's
no
doubt
that
this
record
does
not
show
that
kind
of
control.
as
i
said,
the
statute
does
not
require
that
kind
of
control.
in
order
to
treat
an
organization
as
a
single
organization
for
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
this
isn't
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
the
reason
that
their
evidence
--
there
is
overwhelming
evidence
that
these
organizations
were
very
tightly
interwoven.
now,
if
that's
the
case
of
the
legal
aid
bureaus,
then
the
answer
is
if
the
national
--
let
me
point
out,
your
honor
that
our
evidence
isn't
just
that
the
national
group
is
controlled
by
the
communists.
our
evidence
is
that
the
locals
are
controlled
by
communists.
in
other
words,
the
pattern
is
identical
that
--
that's
why
we
rely
on
the
locals.
if
we
only
had
evidence
i
suppose
of
the
national,
then
what
we
would
have
found
is
that
probably
mr.
forer
would
be
here
saying
what's
all
when
an
organization
and
there
are
no
communist
in
the
locals
and
that
must
show
that
the
communists
really
aren't
in
control.
we
are
the
converse,
there
are
communists
both
places
and
it's
the
government
that's
relying
on
the
fact
that
this
is
a
single
organization
and
the
common
pattern
shows
control
by
the
communist
party.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
would
have
a
lot
of
trouble
making
an
argument,
your
honor
this
is
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
seemingly
a
kind
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
statute
that
--
what
we
are
arguing
here,
your
honor,
has
no
prohibitions
whatsoever.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
i
--
i
would
suspect
that
we
couldn't
do
that
as
to
an
indigent.
the
trouble
was
in
the
communist
party
case,
we
think
the
court
correctly
found
that
this
was
a
very
serious
danger
to
the
country.
the
total
problem
was
a
serious
danger
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
i
really
--
i
must
emphasize
--
the
burden
of
the
petitioner
is
that
its
character
will
be
known
to
non-communists
and
the
petitioner
will
no
longer
be
able
to
benefit
from
its
deception.
that
is
the
detriment,
that's
the
harm
that
i'd
like
to
point,
your
honor
to
i'm
sure,
a
passage
from
the
opinion
that
you
remember
in
your
dissenting
opinion
on
other
grounds
from
the
majority
in
the
viereck
case,
and
there
you
pointed
out
that
disclosure
under
the
foreign
agents
registration
act
was
not
inconsistent
with
the
first
amendment
rights.
it
was
a
positive
implementation
of
the
first
amendment
rights.
after
all,
the
man
who
gives
money
under
deception,
deceit
to
one
of
these
communist-fronts
thinking
that
it
is
merely
just
like
the
american
civil
liberties
union.
he
has
received
information
that
allows
him
to
more
effectively
implement
his
rights
if
he
gets
the
kind
of
information
that
this
statute
provides.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i'm
talking
about
a
very
large
number
of
non-communists
who
support
this
organization
financially
or
in
other
ways.
i'm
also
talking
--
i
think
your
honor,
actually
you're
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
your
honor,
of
course.
i
may
say
also,
you
suggested
well
--
how
about,
how
about
a
particular
alien
who
was
going
to
be
deported.
one
of
the
petitioner's
witnesses
indicated
that
if
anybody
ever
said
anything
to
him,
i
guess
it
was
to
his
relative
who
was
going
to
be
deported.
if
there's
anything
to
them
that
about
communist
aims,
they
would
have
just
--
that
would
have
--
they
would
have
--
wouldn't
want
them
--
the
petitioner
to
represent
them.
it's
very
possible
that
some
of
these
people
wouldn't
have
want
the
petitioner
to
represent
them
either
if
they
know
petitioner's
true
purposes,
that
it
wasn't
really
to
defend
their
rights
but
to
be
helping
the
communist
party.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh
yes,
oh
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
who
was
at
the
registers?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
your
honor.
that
issue
is
not
here
either.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
no,
let
me
separate
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
oh
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
--
as
your
honor
probably
is
aware
that
under
the
standards
of
scales
and
yates,
the
government
is
now
bringing
prosecutions
against
communist
party
members
because
of
the
difficulties
of
proof
of
incitement
to
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
what
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
the
communist
--
the
smith
act
prosecutions
are
connected
with
belonging
to
an
organization
which
itself
advocates
overthrow
of
the
government.
as
i
said
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
the
petitioner
doesn't
itself
advocate
overthrow
of
the
government.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
not
by
that
alone
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
i
want
to
--
no,
i
am
not
trying
to
evade
your
honor's
question.
i
think
there's
no
doubt
that
there's
the
possibility
of
incrimination
by
admitting
that
you're
an
officer
of
this
group.
in
the
time
that
i'm
going
to
have
in
the
next
case,
i'm
going
to
address
to
turn
directly
to
the
fifth
amendment
question.
i
think
there's
--
there
are
many
reasons
why
the
issue
was
premature
now,
reasons
that
were
not
at
least
pointed
out
in
the
communist
party
case
about
prematurity,
but
i
don't
want
to
indicate
that
it's
impossible
to
believe
that
a
person
could
incriminate
himself
by
admitting
that
he
was
the
leader
of
a
communist-front
organization.
i
think
there
is
the
possibility.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
that
was
--
that
is
going
to
be
one
of
the
things
that
i
was
going
to
point.
yes,
your
honor.
the
regulations
are
explicit,
an
attorney
or
any
agent
can
register
a
front
as
well
as
a
communist-action
organization,
and
of
course
such
a
person
could
--
under
no
circumstances,
incriminate
themselves.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
your
honor,
in
addition
he
doesn't
have
to
be
--
let
me
separate
all
two
things,
one
is
whether
the
organization
has
to
disclose
the
name.
and
then
the
second
thing
is
if
the
organization
doesn't
disclose
person's
--
a
person's
name,
that
person
has
to
register.
now,
the
organization
does
not
have
to
disclose
the
names
of
its
members
when
it
is
a
communist-front
organization,
in
contrast
to
a
communist-action
organization.
there
is
however
the
problem
that
mr.
forer
pointed
out.
the
forms
promulgated
by
the
department
of
justice
required
a
detailed
financial
accounting.
they
provide
for
all
contributors.
the
question
would
arise
whether
an
ordinary
dues-paying
member
would
be
considered
a
contributor.
i
think
there
is
an
argument,
i'm
sure
mr.
forer
would
make
it
if
we
had
that
case
here,
there
is
an
argument
that
when
the
congress
said
you
didn't
have
to
disclose
members
that
you
didn't
have
to
disclose
people
who
were
doing
just
the
ordinary
things
that
a
member
does
paying
ordinary
dues.
now,
whether
that
will
ultimate
--
and
only
have
--
and
then
what
people
would
have
to
be
disclosed
are
those
who
made
contributions
above
the
dues
or
who
are
not
members.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
no,
not
to
register
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
the
organization
to
register
themselves.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
because
members
themselves
don't
have
to
be
disclosed.
in
other
words,
anybody
that
has
to
be
disclosed
and
is
not
disclosed
by
the
organization
either
because
it
doesn't
register
or
it
leaves
their
name
off
the
list
has
to
register
himself
since
the
communist-front
organization,
a
member
doesn't
have
to
register
doesn't
have
to
register
himself.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
don't
know
your
honor,
to
be
frank
about
it.
the
forms
i
think
are
not
--
are
not
clear
of
on
who's
going
to
be
included
in
that
list.
it's
possible
that
we
would
be
on
the
other
side
of
mr.
forer's
position.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
pardon
me?
yes,
that's
quite
--
that
wouldn't
go
--
the
forms
certainly
don't
go
to
the
constitution
argument.
if
that's
invalid,
certainly
it'll
be
preferable
for
the
government
could
pointed
out
the
forms
are
unconstitutional
and
not
--
and
not
the
statute.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
not
here
now
except
for
to
the
extent
that
petitioner
argues
that
they
--
that
the
registration
in
and
of
itself
not
to
its
abilities,
registration
in
and
of
itself
is
such
an
interference
with
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
you
have
to
make
a
financial
accounting.
the
question
would
be
whether
you
have
to
disclose
the
names
of
all
those
people
who
paid
dues.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
one
problem
here
is
in
this
particular
case,
i
might
point
out,
the
petitioner
is
not
a
membership
organization
at
all.
it's
an
organization
in
which
anybody
who
wants
to
come
to
the
annual
meeting
comes,
and
then
they
have
a
meeting
and
they
elect
some
officers
and
that's
the
way
the
organization
runs.
apparently,
that's
also
true
with
the
local
committees
although
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
mr.
forer
might
know
that.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
don't
think
so.
they
don't
have
members.
so
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
that's
propagated
by
the
attorney
general.
thank
you,
your
honor.
