not
to
the
part
of
excluding
the
government
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
represented
them
in
part
and
still
the
government
denies
it,
the
other
part
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
is
control.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
let
me
have
a
very
good
example.
suppose
the
communist
party
who
engaged
and
wanted
insurrection
against
the
government,
to
be
in
the
hospital
and
take
anybody
in.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
does
that
exempt
the
hospital?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i'm
using
an
example
here.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
why
is
that?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
how
did
they
put
the
end?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
as
i
heard
you
and
i
thought
you
were
arguing
pretty
effectively
in
saying
that
no
matter
how
benign
it
is,
if
is
controlled
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
would
not
have
to
register
even
though
there's
no
control?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
wouldn't
the
government
argue
that
all
the
things
that
you
are
arguing
would
apply
in
that
given
situation?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
it
helps
the
image
of
the
communist
party
is
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
understand
that,
but
now
when
you
go
on
--
and
i
understand
that,
in
other
words,
there's
a
finding
that
the
communist-front
organization
and
if
it's
controlled
and
it's
a
communist
activity,
part
of
their
activity.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
then
congress
wrote
something
else
and
it
said
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
you're
not
encompassing
all
of
the
controlled
activities.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
really
here,
the
question
is
or
in
this
particular
activity,
is
the
type
that's
controlled.
that
that's
--
it's
included
encompassing
the
statute.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
the
controlled
point
wasn't
argued
very
much
and
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
so
far
as
your
argument
is
concerned,
the
aid
provision
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
i
--
i
believe
what
you
required
is
that
it
should
involve
itself
with
(inaudible)
show
that
communist
(inaudible).
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
by
the
communist
party.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
now,
congress
stopped
there
and
then
regarded
this
as
(inaudible).
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
they
are
the
ones
who
can
get
out
of
control.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
then
you
ought
to
--
(inaudible)
and
also
the
--
the
(inaudible).
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(voice
overlap)
by
the
communist
party.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
what
--
what
about
this
organization,
who
are
just
interested
--
an
immigrant.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
suppose
the
(inaudible).
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
even
though
that
if
an
expert
did
--
did
testify
that
they
were
actually
with
the
communist
party
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
at
present,
it
is.
