supposed
we
had
a
organization
like
this
that
all
that
it
did
was
to

i
think
mr.
fortas
has
brought
over
the
russian
ballet
or

in
order
to
exchange
its
students,
that
would

justice
william
j.
brennan,

supposed
that
they
met

there
were
communist
who
are
members
of
this.

william
j.
brennan,

even
though
it
helped
to
increase
the
prestige
or

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
that
would
be
true,
they
would
be
bringing
over
--
promoting
international
exchange
of
students
and
promoting
ballet.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well
that's
--
were
they
here,
i'm
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
supposed
one
of
those
policies
might
be
to
think
that
these
people
think
well
in
russia.
justice
william
j.

yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

yes.
justice

yes,
yes.

that
would

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
way
not
to
be
a
communist-front
would
be
then
to
actively
engage
and
destroy
the
--
any
good
image
of
russia.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because,
do
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
way
you
have
--
you
have
defined
it,
it's
much
a
pretty
broader
ambit,
i
would
think
of.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
that
in
your
brief,
mr.
terris?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
mean
that
an
officer
of
the
communist
party?

(voice

whoever
it
is
that
has
to
register
would
they
by
registering
risks
the

prosecution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

why
not?
why
wouldn't
just
be
at
least
a
need
to

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
repeat
that
that
answers
my
questions

justice
william
j.
brennan,

--
in
fact,
that
you're
not
possibly

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i'm
getting
to
is
the
--
what
concerned
me
as
you
recall
is
the
communist
party
case
and
that
was
that
an
officer
the
communist
party
would
have
to
record
by
the
mere
self
revelation
that
he
was
an
officer
risked
possibilities
of
prosecutions
under
the
smith
act.
and
that's
the
view
i
took
from
the
communist
party
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
any
different?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
my
question
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
may
not.
but
i'm
asking
you
whether
an
officer
or
one
of
these
communist-front
organizations
could
comply
to
the
registration
provision
and
register
to
the
communist-front
organization
reveal
that
he
was
the
president,
would
he
by
that
revelation
risk
the
possibility
of
the
smith
act
prosecution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

not
by
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
terris,
am
i
correct
from
my
recollection
that
under
the
action
organization,
if
the
officers
don't
register
it,
the
statute
imposes
a
duty
upon
the
members
to
register
the
action
organization?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
does
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
not
true
whether

communist-front
org
