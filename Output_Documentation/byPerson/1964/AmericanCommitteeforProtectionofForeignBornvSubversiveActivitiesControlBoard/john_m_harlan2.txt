was
there
any
evidence
that
the
organization
was
doing
things
other
than
these
activities
that
you're
referring
to?
justice
john
m.
harlan
were
the
communists

(inaudible)
without
the

in
a
number
of
ways,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
anyway,
is
that
what
you're
--
is
that
what
you're
arguing?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
you
look
not
at
the
character
of
that
provision
but
you
look
at
the
purpose
of
which
the
activities
are
undertaken,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
the
aid
itself
may
be
partly
--
involved
perfectly
laudable.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
that
the
part
of
saying
is
to
involve
or
to
have
itself
engaged,
as
part
of
the
record,
is
that
the
original
communist-action
definition?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
communist-front,
a
popular
definition
by
(inaudible)
or
by
the

that
it
is
an
organization
(inaudible).

john
m.
harlan
the
purpose
of
the

is
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
(inaudible)
that
you
in
fact
require.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you're
saying
is
that
communist
org
--
named
organizations
in
the
next
case
as
an
organization
called
the
gentleman
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that
it's
expounding
the
principle
related
to
--
the
other
purposes
followed
to
the
principle
of
--
the
principle
established,
as
discussed
in

is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
the
question
is
whether
that
is
permissible.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan

the
test
you're

justice
john
m.

in
a
sense,
it
has
to
be
proved.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
the
sense,
(voice

there
would
be
an
equal
test
to
be
proved.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
saying
that
--
are
you
saying
that
the
organization
would
not
have
been
defending
acceptable
purpose
of
the
--
its
own
interest
for
this
act
where
he
thought
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
or
be
done,
it
should
be
done
and
must
be
done
the
only
reason
for
its
seeming
business
is
to
help
the
communist
party
detriment
an
organization
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
i
hear
you

m.
harlan
you
have
to
go
