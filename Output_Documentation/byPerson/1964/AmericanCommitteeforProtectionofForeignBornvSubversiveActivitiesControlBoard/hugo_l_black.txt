justice

what
does
--
what
does
the
act
provides
they
should
move
people
who
register
and
lobby
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
can
be
done
for
them
for
lobbying?
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
a
pretty
bad
analogy
you
used
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
it
reached
that
little
fine
pinpoint
in
the
brief.
it
didn't
even
get
to
the
possibility
that
they
might
even
end
up
with.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
didn't
get
to
the
prob
--
possibility
that
they
would
register
it,
did
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
said
--
said
they
might
not
register.
justice
hugo
l.
black
therefore,
you
don't
have
to
reach
any
of
these
other
things.
but
how
do
you
decided
for
us
now
to
say
we
shouldn't
consider
them
now.t
hey've
got
to
register
now,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
are
included
in
this
order?
just
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
particular
order
just
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
that,
you
said,
nobody
can
deny
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
defend
them
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
it
will
be
consistent
with
the
constitutional
provision
and
stands
to
the
right
of
counsel
for
the
government
to
make
it
against
the
law
for
some
man
that
it
says
it's
engaged
in
the
bad
undertaking,
to
pay
--
to
pay
money
to
get
him
represented
by
a
counsel.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
why
is
that
important
to
the
argument
you're
making?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
admitted
--
it's
registered.
everybody
knows
the
purpose
of
the
registry.
suppose
you
made
every
man
who's
going
to
help
an
injured
to
get
a
lawyer
register,
do
you
think
if
you
could
make
him
register
because
--
take
him
out
because
he
was
--
believed
in
something
or
had
some
purpose,
would
you
have
to
make
them
all
register
alike?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
all
he's
doing
is
to
get
a
lawyer
for
a
man,
when
the
constitution
from
the
first
day
it
was
written,
the
first
day
of
the
bill
of
rights
was
written,
it
has
provided
a
man
--
is
entitled
to
a
lawyer.
how
can
you
put
any
kind
of
penalty
or
punishment
or
burden
on
a
man
who
tries
to
give
him
help
to
get
him
a
lawyer?
the
constitution
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
that
a
law
was
passed
to
protect
defendants
who
were
charged
in
this
trial
from
being
deceived
by
somebody
as
to
what
they
believe
in
who
wants
to
supply
them
a
lawyer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
agree
i'm
sure
that
the
communist
is
entitled
to
have
a
lawyer
now?
