mr.
thomas
b.
finan
chief
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
accept
the
facts
that
--
that
have
been
presented
here
by
the
appellant
with
one
or
two
exception
which
we
do
not
believe
are
too
material
but
we
would
like
to
call
with
the
court's
attention.
first
of
all,
we
have
a
situation
here
where
mr.
freedman
called
a
censorship
board,
told
them
the
hour
and
the
place
where
he
was
going
to
show
this
film
“revenge
at
daybreak”.
and
mrs.
holland
who
was
a
reviewer
employed
by
the
board
at
that
juncture
specifically
told
him
that
he
would
be
violating
the
laws
of
the
state
of
maryland
specifically
section
2
of
article
66a
which
is
our
censorship
law.
mr.
freedman
and
the
record
will
show,
said
that
that
is
exactly
what
he
wanted
to
do.
he
wanted
to
set
up
a
test
case.
when
mrs.
holland
went
to
the
theater
that
evening
and
viewed
the
film
for
the
purpose
of
saying
whether
it
did
have
a
state
censorship
seal
on
it.
mr.
freedman
was
there
with
his
lawyer
and
after
the
movie,
when
she
presented
him
with
a
violation
notice,
he
accepted
it
in
the
presence
of
his
lawyer.
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
one
other
thing
which
we
--
item
we
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
and
that
is
although
in
the
appellant's
brief,
they
emphasize
that
over
a
period
of
40
years,
the
revenue
which
the
board
has
realized
through
its
license
fees
with
an
excess
of
half
a
million
dollars,
that's
a
little
over
11
to
12,000
–
a
little
over
$12,000
a
year.
there
had
been
several
years,
including
1959,
1962,
and
it
would
have
been
in
operating
in
the
deficit
in
‘61
if
it
had
not
been
for
none
appropriated
or
non-expended
appropriation
of
$1500.
the
point
i'm
making
is
this.
a
fee
charge
is
an
administrative
fee.
it's
not
a
revenue
fee.
it
is
a
fee
to
cover
the
expenses
of
the
board.
now,
we
reach
with
this
case
again
the
armageddon
of
censorship
because
it
is
obvious
what
freedman
has
done
in
this
case
is
to
try
to
put
more
flesh
on
the
old
times
film
case
versus
chicago
which
this
court
heard
in
1961
and
bring
it
back
to
the
court,
the
same
old
purpose,
with
a
little
bit
more
of
flesh
on
it
because
it's
in
the
record.
i
want
to
rather
elaborate
things
to
show
that
mrs.
holland
who
had
seen
the
film
to
see
if
it
had
the
censorship
seal
on
it,
stated
after
the
film
was
over
that
if
they
exhibited
to
the
board
anyway,
they
would
have
approve
it
because
it
was
innoxious.
the
very
inception
of
this
case,
the
state
has
taken
the
stand
that
the
film
was
innoxious.
and
the
trial
of
the
case
before
judge
sidero
(ph),
they
kept
insisting
that
the
judge
see
the
film,
the
judge
--
that
he
didn't
see
where
it
was
--
any
point
to
seeing
the
film,
no
point
of
viewing
it,
that's
not
an
issue.
the
standards
aren't
the
issue.
that
they
admit
that
the
film
is
--
is
innoxious.
they
finally
made
an
arrangement
for
him
to
see
it.
he
went
to
the
censorship
office
--
censor's
office
in
a
state
office
building
where
they
have
a
little
theater
and
they
viewed
the
film.
he
again,
likewise
in
his
opinion
states
that
it's
innoxious.
we
contend
that
this
is
immaterial
entirely
to
the
issue
which
is
involved
here.
now,
in
the
times
film
case
when
it
was
heard
by
this
court,
you
have
justice
clark
stating
that
the
character
and
nature
of
the
film
was
unknown
but
is
immaterial.
and
even
justice
warren
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
that
case,
the
court
does
not
even
have
before
it
an
attempt
by
the
city
to
restrain
the
exhibition
of
an
allegedly
obscene
film.
again
at
page
418,
justice
warren
is
speaking
for
the
minority
of
the
court
said
the
inquiry
as
stated
by
the
court
but
never
resolved
is
whether
licensing
as
a
prerequisite
to
exhibition
is
barred
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
and
i
submit
we
have
this
--
again
it's
a
reprise
of
the
times
film
case.
those
were
filed
briefs
in
this
case
as
amicus
curiae
recognizes
it
as
the
same
case.
they
state
the
issue
in
their
brief
as
the
same,
a
question
of
a
pre-review
or
pre-restraint
prior
to
exhibition
for
the
purpose
of
reviewing
the
film.
now,
we
also
contend
that
if
the
court
feels
that
it
should
have
some
preview
of
the
censorship
laws
of
the
state
of
maryland
and
a
question
of
censorship
in
general,
that
what
we
have
here
is
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
appellant
to
come
back
into
court
and
to
again
try
to
rehearse
this
case.
but
if
we
wouldn't
take
a
review
of
the
development
of
this
issue,
we
note
that
the
appellant
makes
a
very
brave
array
of
cases
trying
to
show
what
great
crimes
there
were
have
been
committed
to
suppress
censorship
or
to
suppress
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
the
press.
and
they
have
assembled
many
of
the
old
landmark
cases
which
have
come
down
to
us
in
the
common
law
and
our
own
great
cases
here
in
this
country.
however,
all
of
these
brave
language
has
little
strength
or
meaning
in
the
contents
of
this
present
case.
i'm
sure
that
all
of
us
as
americans
have
a
great
appreciation
of
our
anglo-saxon
heritage
of
freedom
of
speech.
and
every
cultivated
and
intelligent
man
respects
and
admires
the
purity
of
freedom
of
speech
advocated
by
such
great
champions
as
voltaire,
russo,
peter
zenger,
pane,
thomas
jefferson,
we
could
go
on
down
the
list.
and
we
know
that
recent
history
introduces
--
as
introduced
to
this
court
such
constitutional
eminences
as
the
american
cases
of
j.
m.
near,
newton
cantwell
and
r.
j.
thomas.
and
we
know
of
the
arguments
of
free
speech
which
have
been
urged
over
the
decades
in
the
field
of
philosophy
and
science,
a
tremendous
list
of
jehovah
witnesses
cases
in
the
field
of
religion,
the
cases
of
eugene-debs
and
trying
out
these
economic
theories,
and
all
of
these
were
landmark
cases.
and
they
represent
great
men
in
many
instances
trying
to
challenge
and
confront
the
government
and
theories
of
government
under
the
protection
which
they
were
validly
entitled
to
of
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution.
but
i
submit
to
this
court
that
those
who
lurk
around
their
pornographic
fringes
of
the
film
industry
have
no
communality
with
these
great
landmark
cases
which
we
read
about
with
pride
as
americans
and
which
certainly
as
a
tribute
to
this
court
in
its
effort
to
try
to
give
to
us
as
americans,
as
complete
of
liberty
and
the
exercise
of
our
freedoms
as
possible.
now,
we
certainly
hope
that
this
court,
that
this
case
presented,
it
would
be
almost
ludicrous,
the
manner
in
--
the
elaborate
way
in
which
this
was
restaged
to
get
it
before
this
court
if
it
were
not
for
the
profundity
of
the
issue
involved.
and
we
certainly
submit
that
this
court
will
not
voluntarily
declare
its
bankruptcy
to
the
libidinous.
and
hold
that
the
state
of
maryland
has
no
power
to
its
censorship
board
to
determine
what
may
or
may
not
be
an
obscene
movie.
if
the
court
is
prone
to
consider
the
constitutionality
of
movie
censorship,
i
should
also
suggest
we
think
for
a
moment
what
has
happened
to
the
film
industry.
we
know
that
family
film
has
practically
disappeared
from
the
scene.
the
old
face
in
western
and
the
mystery
has
been
abandoned
to
television.
what
remains
generally
is
the
predetermined
effort
of
the
industry
to
attract
the
public
primarily
to
sex
and
violence.
now,
for
almost
50
years,
this
maryland
censorship
board
has
been
in
existence.
we
feel
that
it
has
not
acted
arbitrary
or
capricious
for
the
number
of
cases
that
actually
get
into
court
as
i'm
sure
the
court
is
well
aware
and
recognizes.
there
is
a
vast
multitude
of
films
which
never
get
into
litigation
because
the
people
who
would
show
them
are
keenly
aware
of
the
existence
of
the
censorship
board
and
know
that
they
are
obscene,
and
that
they
will
be
turned
down
so
they
don't
make
the
effort.
now,
if
you
remove
completely
censorship,
i
predict
as
you
would
have
a
complete
enroll
of
these
type
of
films
which
are
certainly
today
not
allowed.
just
recently,
many
films
--
i'm
sure
we've
all
seen
--
maryland
goes
about
as
far
as
anybody.
they
--
people
kill
up
to
see
tom
jones
three,
eight
to
10
blocks
almost
long
when
it
first
was
shown.
we
have
certainly
adopted
standards
which
we
feel
are
not
beyond
what
this
court
has
indicated
in
a
number
of
decisions
which
have
come
before
it.
actually,
i
do
not
feel
that
the
question
of
the
standards
are
before
the
court
today
because
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
absolutely
not,
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
no
--
we
feel
that's
not
the
issue
at
all.
section
2
of
article
66a
is
the
only
thing
before
us.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
but
for
a
moment,
let's
take
the
situation
regarding
the
invoking
of
what
statutes
maryland
have
--
has
on
obscenity.
and
i
might
state
that
there
are
four
of
section
417
and
418
of
article
27
and
it's
quite
doubtful
whether
they
are
--
whether
they
are
applicable
to
films.
now
of
course,
i
realize
the
legislature
could
pass
obscenity
laws
relating
to
the
film
but
our
present
obscenity
laws
deal
with
photographs.
we
use
the
word
photographs
indecent
literature
and
so
forth,
a
pornographic
literature
and
it
would
appear
that
it
would
--
particularly
the
date
in
which
it
was
passed
that
they
had
in
mind
still
as
it
were.
but
let
us
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
our
obscenity
statute
would
apply
to
a
film.
now,
if
the
movie
house
operator
who
is
guilty
of
the
violation
of
showing
an
obscene
film
is
arrested,
he
goes
before
the
magistrate.
he
has
an
appeal
as
the
court
well
knows
from
the
magistrate
to
the
circuit
court
and
from
the
circuit
court
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
then
can
apply
to
this
court
for
writ
of
certiorari.
now,
i
would
presume
in
the
interim
that
that
film
will
be
shown
all
over
the
state.
by
the
time
the
litigation
has
come
to
some
conclusion
as
to
whether
he
was
guilty
of
violating
the
statutes
on
obscenity
of
maryland,
that
would
probably
then
be
ready
for
a
second
run
of
the
movie.
we
feel
that
this
is
a
situation
where
the
appellant
is
saying
--
have
no
preventative
medicine
at
all,
only
remedial
medicine.
it
would
be
as
though
of
that
–-
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
we
have
no
censorship
of
books
other
than
they
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
the
sec
--
section
417
and
418
which
i
just
mentioned
of
our
criminal
statute
would
be
applicable.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
we
might
--
let
me
state
this.
we
--
it's
invoked
occasionally
but
i
would
say
that
i
don't
say
this
with
any
degree
of
pride
at
all.
it
depends
on
how
you
look
at
these
things
but
i
don't
believe
maryland
is
abused
by
any
untoward
crusade
to
ban
books
or
ever
had
that
reputation
if
something
as
social
issues
that
it's
called
to
the
authority's
attention
and
it
is
so
obviously
pornographic,
they
move
in
under
that
statute.
but
that
had
been
many,
many
years
since
we've
had
any
cases
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
that.
but
the
–-
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
no
but
the
situation
is
we
feel
that
you
can
distinguish
between
books
and
between
movies.
first
of
all,
the
impact
--
a
visual
impact
has
been
recognized
by
the
court.
the
question
of
the
sound
background,
the
motion
of
the
film,
and
everything
has
a
greater
impact
on
the
public.
and
we
feel
that
you
--
that
the
courts
have
recognized
that
you
can
make
a
very
valid
distinction
between
the
norms
of
action
taken
to
curtail
obscene
movies
and
perhaps
obscene
books.
we
certainly
feel
that
there
is
no
substance
to
the
appellant's
contention
that
when
a
movie
is
banned
by
the
censors
and
it
gets
into
court
and
years
go
by.
actually,
it
is
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
oh
yes!
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
no,
the
chicago's
--
the
chicago
ordinance
for
instance
provide
for
the
merits
to
look
out
it
after
the
censorship
court.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
maryland,
it
would
go
directly
to
the
court
which
is
the
circuit
court,
right.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
that
is
on
appeal
of
right
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
they
stand
over
the
seal.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
they
--
yes
they
do.
i'm
wrong.
they
do
if
they
--
if
the
reviewer
turns
it
down
or
if
one
or
two
members
of
the
board
turn
it
down,
they
call
the
whole
board
together
for
a
hearing
and
they
will
call
in
the
film
operator
and
his
attorney.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
completely
de
novo.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
no,
that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
well,
i
think,
mr.
justice,
there
again,
you're
getting
into
the
field
of
the
responsibility
of
a
federal
government
to
feel
it
for
any
protection
of
public
moral
as
i
assume
it
does
somewhat.
naturally,
we
have
no
control
over
that.
they
can
be
shown.
i
would
say
this
as
we
read
in
the
papers
everyday,
there
is
a
considerable
human
outcry
throughout
the
nation
over
what
they
feel
might
be
the
impact
of
this
film
being
shown
without
any
--
any
censorship.
but
i
think
the
--
the
crux
of
this
might
be
phrased
by
an
analogy.
mr.
freedman
has
--
his
attorney
has
urge
that
he
should
be
able
to
show
a
film
without
any
type
of
license,
without
submitting
it
for
censorship.
and
he
is
somewhat
akin
to
for
instance,
a
restaurant
--
restaurant
operator
who
sells
meals
to
the
public.
and
let
us
assume
he
has
a
well
in
the
back
of
his
restaurant
on
the
ground
that
he
has
at
the
back
of
his
restaurant.
and
he
insists
on
using
well
water
to
feed
or
to
give
water
to
his
patrons.
and
the
city
has
an
ordinance
which
says
that
nobody
can
serve
water
in
a
commercial
restaurant
or
in
a
restaurant
unless
it
comes
from
the
city
water
supply.
and
the
restaurant
here
says,
why
--
i
have
the
finest
water
in
the
state.
and
i'm
going
to
insist
on
serving
it
to
my
patrons.
and
then
they
arrest
him
and
they
take
samples
of
the
water
and
they
find
that
it
is
even
more
pure
than
the
city
water.
so
therefore
he
says
the
ordinance
is
no
good,
i
should
--
even
though
everybody
have
to
comply
with
this
ordinance,
who
sell
or
serve
water
publicly
in
a
restaurant,
i
should
not
be
compelled
to
--
to
do
it.
and
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
innoxious
character
of
my
product
is
my
defense.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
on
what?
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
first
amendment,
right.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
i
--
i
realized
that
but
--
we
--
again
we
know
that
the
first
amendment
has
never
authorize
obscenity.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
and
those
types
of
films
are
not
in
the
protected
group.
now
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
well
mr.
justice,
we
of
course
feel
that
if
mr.
freedman
is
successful,
he
may
as
well
forget
about
any
state
censorship.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
well
–-
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
yes,
i
think
it
does
mr.
justice
but
i
--
i
feel
that,
again,
i
think
that
we
must
never
overlook
or
fail
to
observe
the
traditional
distinction
made
between
literature
and
the
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
of
the
motion
picture
where
the
--
you
have
many
other
influences
coming
in
together
to
focus
on
the
screen.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
that
--
that
is
our
contention
to
have
a
–
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
right.
i
--
but
we
have
never
censored
books
and
that
--
in
the
sense
that
we
have
films.
and
of
course,
this
has
been
one
of
the
continual
arguments
that
i'm
sure
this
court
has
heard
on
other
occasions
when
this
--
what
is
the
difference?
why
is
there
a
difference?
why
is
there
a
distinction?
but
we
do
feel
that
this
case
if
it
is
resolved
against
the
state,
we'll
do
nothing
to
advance
freedom
of
speech
but
we
do
feel
that
we
all
go
far
to
advance
the
distribution
of
obscene
movies.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
yes
but,
mr.
justice,
i
still
feel
that
if
censorship
is
completely
banned,
these
movies
will
--
let
us
assume
they
want
to
show
mostly
they're
from
the
foreign
market
as
we
know
some
film
which
--
and
children
from
the
ages,
they
can
buy
a
ticket
and
walk
in
and
they
--
they
might
even
have
for
adult
consumption
but
the
very
few
theater
owners
that
go
around
checking
whether
or
not
the
people
coming
in
are
over
18,
14
or
whatever
they
might
be.
but
they
walk
in
to
these
movies
and
the
damage
is
done
if
we
assume
that
there
is
some
damage,
traumatic
effect
to
their
thinking
on
these
things.
it's
done
before,
they
can
be
corrected,
and
this
shifts
the
burden
completely
to
merely
have
us
go
out
and
arrest
people
on
violation
of
the
statutes
of
obscenity.
we
feel
it
would
do
irreparable
damage
to
the
whole
concept
of
censorship.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
well
mr.
justice,
if
i
may
answer
that
in
this
manner.
the
four
states
i
believe
have
censorship
but
there
are
a
number
of
large
cities
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
philadelphia?
i
would
venture
to
say
that
perhaps
a
goodly
60%
of
the
urban
population
of
this
nation
or
50%
of
the
urban
population
of
this
nation,
less
than
an
area
where
there
is
some
type
of
movie
censorship.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
in
district
of
columbia
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
no.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
well,
the
only
way
that
mr.
justice
that
i
would
see
that
you
would
get
the
first
indication
that
such
movies
would
--
were
being
exhibited
would
be
by
the
police
officer
on
the
beat
who
would
probably
see
these
things
and
hear
some
boys
on
the
street
corner
talking
about
it
or
something
and
decide
what
he'll
do
and
see
what
it's
all
about.
and
how
many
days
or
weeks
could
be
running
and
how
many
places,
i
don't
know.
i'm
sure
we'd
only
estimate
or
make
a
guess
on
that
but
conjecture
--
but
perhaps
we
are
old
fashion,
i
don't
think
so.
but
i
firmly
believe
that
the
impact
of
many
of
these
lewd
films
on
young
people
especially,
there
r
by
young
people
especially
from
the
ages
say
about
13
to
19
has
an
incalculable
effect
upon
them.
and
i
think
we're
just
kidding
ourselves
if
we
don't
think
it
does.
and
it
--
perhaps
we
put
some
burden
on
the
movie
industry
in
this
regard
but
i
don't
believe
that
it
outweighs
the
general
welfare
of
the
public
and
we're
not
--
i
don't
feel
unduly
impinging
upon
the
great
right
of
free
speech
which
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendments
give
us.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
i
recognize
that,
mr.
justice,
but
let
me
state
this
if
i
may.
we
are
approaching
this
case
in
the
background
of
the
times
film
versus
chicago.
and
frankness
would
compel
me
to
state
that
the
only
reason
that
this
case
if
we
will
assume
on
the
basis
of
stare
decisis
that
times
film
versus
chicago
still
prevail,
i
think
we're
right
on
this.
and
i
would
say
that
the
only
reason
that
this
case
is
here
before
under
somewhat
of
a
disguise
is
that
the
appellant
in
this
case
is
well
aware
that
since
1961
when
the
times
film
case
was
decided,
there
has
been
some
change
of
personnel
and
so
does
the
tribunal.
and
what
the
ultimate
decision
might
be,
i
don't
know.
i
certainly
hope
that
the
court
will
sustain
this.
