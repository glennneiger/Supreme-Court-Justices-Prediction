justice
byron
r.
white
well,
aren't
you
--
aren't
you
essentially
claiming
that
you
don't
need
to
overrule
the
times
film
here
because
the
state
says
to
you
or
to
your
client
that
we
don't
claim
this
film
that
you
want
to
show,
it's
obscene
at
all
but
nevertheless
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
get
a
license.
on
the
fact
of
this
case,
it's
just
as
though
the
state
had
already
reviewed
this
film
in
connection
with
this
exhibition
by
another
exhibitor
at
the
time
that
it
was
an
obscene
and
gave
him
a
license.
and
then
you
want
to
show
the
same
film
in
another
city
or
in
the
same
city
on
the
second
line.
and
the
licensing
board
says,
nevertheless,
you
must
submit
it
and
pay
your
license
fee
even
though
we
know
it's
not
obscene.
isn't
that
your
position
on
the
facts
of
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
is
insisting
on
licensing
even
though
they
--
they
know
it's
not
--
it's
not
obscene.
that's
what
your
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
purported
you
that,
i
presume.
they
said
anytime
you
want
to
submit
a
film,
we'll
tell
you
whether
it's
obscene
or
not.
they're
giving
you
the
opportunity.
i
would
think
your
position
would
be
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
at
the
time
that
they
attempted
to
stop
you
or
to
threaten
you
with
criminal
prosecution,
they
knew
the
thing
was
obscene.
justice
byron
r.
white
otherwise,
that's
how
you
avoid
times
film.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
--
according
to
the
administrative
level,
there
is
no
--
the
only
thing
the
censorship
board
does
is
to
look
at
the
film.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
doesn't
purport
to
have
any
kind
of
a
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
but
then
if
it
goes
to
court,
is
it
completely
a
de
novo
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
not
on
the
record.
it's
not
on
the
administrative
record
and
you
don't
say
that
you
had
a
judi
--
judicial
type
hearing
before
the
administrative
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say
--
you
would
say
mr.
attorney
general
that
if
--
if
--
if
maryland
had
a
censorship
law
applicable
to
books
like
it
has
for
movies,
the
quantity
of
books
would
--
would
do
away
with
your
book
censorship.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
do
you
suppose
they
don't?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
--
you
mean
the
criminal
prosecution.
