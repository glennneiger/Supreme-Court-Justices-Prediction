justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
the
essence
of
your
position
necessarily
must
be
without
regard
to
whether
it's
a
picture
which
would
have
been
licensed
or
not.
and
an
exhibitor
may
exhibit
without
prior
submission.
and
then
if
he
is
prosecuted
for
showing
something
that
may
be
suppressed
as
a
motion
picture,
if
he
prevails
that
it's
not
suppressible,
then
the
indictment
should
be
dismissed
in
any
event
he
should
prevail.
and
that
he
suffers
a
penalty
only
if
it's
something
that
might
be
suppressible
as
obscene
or
otherwise,
isn't
--
basically,
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
but
if
that
is
your
position,
mr.
bilgrey,
i
have
the
same
difficulty
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
has.
why
that
--
if
we
will
--
are
to
agree
with
that,
why
that
doesn't
involve
overruling
times
film?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
you'd
welcome
it
but
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is
whether
acceptance
to
your
position,
but
does
it
necessarily
mean
that
we
overrule
times
film?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
what's
left
--
what's
left
of
this
--
of
this
maryland
licensing
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
--
what
at
all
is
left
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
an
exhibitor
doesn't
have
to
submit
in
advance
and
he
can't
be
punished
for
not
submitting
in
advance,
but
that
the
question
of
penalty
has
to
wait
a
prosecution
for
exhibiting
something
which
is
otherwise
suppressible.
i
don't
see
how
that
doesn't
mean
you
(voice
overlap)
the
whole
â€“-
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
once
you
leave
it
with
the
exhibitor,
then
the
mandate
of
the
law
that
operates
this
is
no
longer
mandated.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
other
procedures
mr.
attorney
general?
are
there
administrative
procedures
after
the
board
turns
it
down
before
he
goes
to
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
before
they
get
into
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
is
it
in
maryland?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
it's
from
the
circuit
court
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
that
an
appeal
of
right
from
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
suggest
mr.
attorney
general,
i
wonder
whether
the
analogy
is
good
because
the
argument
has
been
made,
and
of
course
is
practically
on
the
first
amendment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
first
amendment
--
on
the
first
amendment
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
does
not
sort
of
thing
of
course
that
would
be
involved
is
in
the
case
that
it
would.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
this
would
tell
you
--
with
this
of
course,
what
is
the
determination
whether
there
is
something
is
or
isn't.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
that
our
decision
last
year
in
quantity
of
books
has
any
bearing
in
the
question
we're
discussing
today?
remember
that
was
the
one
where
a
warrant
issued
on
the
examination
of
seven
books
and
we
thought
that
a
warrant
to
pick
up
39
other
titles
could
be
justified
because
of
prior
restraints
at
least
until
it
had
been
a
determination
of
obscenity
in
the
first
instance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
that
has
any
bearing
here
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
motion
picture.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
the
suggestion
there
was
at
least
in
the
case
of
books,
there
has
to
be
a
prior
judicial
determine
--
determination
and
adversary
hearing
on
the
issue
of
obscenity
and
you
suggest
that
perhaps
the
distinction
between
books
and
motion
pictures
doesn't
require
that
same
sort
of
procedure
in
the
case
of
motion
picture.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
do
apply
in
the
movie?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
all
for
books
