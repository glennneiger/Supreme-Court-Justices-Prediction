in
this
particular
case
by

there
wouldn't

there
wouldn't
have
been
any

you
could
get
your

you
either
got
to

you
don't
have

either
this

correctly

on
this

that
you
headed
by

to
assume
that
the

there
in

no
description
of
which
was
in
the
record
was
as
violent
objectionable
film
as
you
could
possibly
imagine.
and
we
still
have
to
say
that
there
could
be
no
previous
discretion
of
the
most

even
if
society
have
studied
the

something
that
advocated

very
effectively

it
was
never

so
we
have
to
assume
it
was,
as
i
say,
completely
objectionable
in
every
way,
in
a
variety
way.
this
case
you
say
is
different
because

well
in

it
was

it's

and
you've
also
said
i
think
in
answer
to
mr.

earlier
question
that
you
would
concede
that

a

on

you're

bother
asking

he
will
just
go
ahead

then
do

there
