mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
to
this
court
on
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
maryland
court
of
the
appeals.
the
judgment
appealed
upon
affirmed
a
criminal
conviction
and
a
fine
of
$25
pronounced
by
the
baltimore
criminal
court.
that
court
found
ronald
freedman,
the
appellant,
guilty
of
violating
sections
of
the
maryland
code
which
establishes
the
maryland
motion
picture
censor
board
and
which
make
it
a
crime
to
commercially,
publicly
exhibit
any
film
not
submitted
to
that
board
together
with
the
amounted
fee
and
which
is
not
approved
and
licensed
by
the
board.
to
put
concretely,
this
appeal
puts
the
question
before
this
court
whether
maryland
can
compatibly
with
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
impose
criminal
penalties
on
the
act
of
exhibiting
a
film
which
as
maryland
has
here
conceded,
does
not
run
a
foul
any
valid
first
amendment
standard.
the
question
arose
in
this
way.
the
appellant,
ronald
freedman,
is
a
lessee
of
a
motion
picture
theater
located
in
baltimore.
he
is
on
principle
unsympathetic
to
the
idea
of
censorship
and
i
may
add,
he
has
had
a
series
of
disputes
with
the
board
in
which
he's
always
come
out
on
top.
he's
always
disputed
the
discretionary
authority
of
the
board.
in
at
least
one
instance,
as
the
record
in
this
case
indicates
at
page
15
of
the
record,
the
appellant
have
to
fight
the
board
on
a
ban
of
a
film
which
after
many
months
in
a
great
expense,
he
was
finally
vindicated
on
and
this
was
a
film
like
all
others,
he
thought
that
he
could
in
his
judgment
play
without
submitting
to
the
board
to
begin
with.
it
was
against
this
background
that
mr.
freedman
decided
in
the
fall
of
1962
to
test
directly
the
authority
of
the
maryland
motion
picture
censor
board.
accordingly,
he
called
and
this
is
at
page
17
on
the
record.
he
called
one
of
the
officials
of
the
board.
in
fact,
he
called
the
chief
reviewer
and
he
told
her
of
his
intension
to
ignore
or
to
defy
the
law
that
he
would
commercially
exhibit
a
film
without
a
permit.
and
that
evening,
when
in
fact
he
exhibited
the
film,
the
chief
reviewer
was
present
and
she
caused
mr.
freedman
to
be
arrested
after
the
exhibition.
now,
he
was
arrested
for
the
alleged
violation
of
section
2
of
article
66a
of
the
maryland
code
which
makes
it
unlawful
and
incidentally,
that
is
at
page
1
of
our
record.
section
2
makes
it
unlawful
to
exhibit
any
motion
picture
film,
and
the
statute
is
concerned
with
commercial
exhibitions,
in
the
state
of
maryland
unless
the
set
film
has
been
submitted
by
the
lessee
of
the
film
and
duly
approved
and
licensed
by
the
motion
picture
censor
board.
i
should
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
at
this
time
that
principal
provisions
of
article
66a
are
set
forth
at
pages
3
through
5
of
our
brief
and
that
the
entire
article
is
reproduced
as
appendix
a
following
page
41
of
our
brief.
at
some
months
later,
ronald
freedman
was
tried
in
the
baltimore
criminal
court
on
this
charge.
and
at
the
trial,
we
--
mr.
freedman
sought
to
introduce
testimony
which
it
admitted
would
have
indicated
that
the
chief
reviewer,
mrs.
holland
would
have
passed
the
film
--
had
been
submitted
to
her.
however,
the
state
objected
to
the
introduction
of
that
evidence.
however,
in
response
to
a
question
by
judge
darrell,
he
was
the
trial
judge,
the
state
made
it
clear
that
it
would
have
licensed
the
film
and
that
there
were
no
objections
to
the
film.
now,
at
pages
2
--
i'm
sorry,
page
7
through
9
in
our
brief,
we
--
the
appellant
developed
a
testimony
from
the
members
of
the
board
of
censors
as
to
how
the
censor
board
actually
functions.
i
mentioned
that
because
i
do
not
believe
i
will
have
time
to
take
up
that
testimony
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
among
the
things
that
mr.
freedman
demonstrated
was
that
the
board
takes
in
fees
for
every
print
that
is
commercially
shown
in
a
motion
picture
theatre
in
the
state
of
maryland
and
that
the
fees
average
about
$30
for
initial
prints
and
about
roughly
$15
for
sub
--
for
all
subsequent
prints.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
my
answer
to
your
question
would
be
that
i
suppose
the
city
could
have
imposed
a
tax
but
that
this
tax
is
in
the
nature
of
a
tax
as
this
court
has
struck
and
set
aside
in
the
goldstein
case.
i
think
this
--
the
sole
purpose
of
this
tax
was
to
--
to
restrain
in
advance
all
films.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well
i
don't
know
if
i
can
go
too
far
to
say
that
mr.
justice
goldberg,
but
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
statute
at
the
fee
requirement
together
with
the
other
requirements
of
the
statute.
i
think
the
sole
requirement
here
of
the
fee
pertains
to
the
board,
to
the
censor
board.
this
is
not
a
tax.
i
don't
know.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
i
think
the
sole
relevancy
that
i
may
suggest
in
this
court
is
that
the
court
is
held
in
cases
like
goldstein
and
murdock
that
the
tax
here
is
--
there
it
was
used
to
restrain
speech.
i
believe
that
that
is
the
sole
context
in
which
i
suggest
this
court,
accept
those
cases.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
i'm
using
--
i'm
using
the
tax
together
with
--
with
the
manner
in
which
the
tax
is
here
used,
the
purpose
of
the
tax
which
is
to
pay
the
board
the
sole
function
of
which
is
to
censor
films.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
you
mean
the
ministerial
tax
like
a
tax
--
strictly
ministerial
tax.
i
suppose
it
would
--
it
would
be
different
although
i
certainly
don't
want
to
foreclose
of
prejudice
at
that
issue
one
way
or
another.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
no.
i
hardly
can
allege
that
mr.
justice
goldberg.
now,
at
the
close
of
the
testimony,
mr.
freedman
moved
for
judgment
of
acquittal
on
various
federal
grounds
which
are
set
forth
verbatim
at
pages
8
and
9
of
our
brief.
specifically,
the
appellant
urge
on
the
trial
judge
that
article
66a
is
an
infringement
of
the
rights
of
free
speech,
that
the
standards
are
vague
and
indefinite
and
also
that
the
--
that
it
imposes
a
tax
on
the
exercise
of
protected
rights.
these
constitutional
claims
had
been
urged
that
every
level
of
this
litigation
and
the
reason
that
i
mentioned
them
here
is
because
i
hardly
think
i
will
have
time
to
develop
them
on
this
argument.
now,
some
two
months
after
the
completion
of
the
trial,
judge
sidero
(ph)
filed
a
memorandum
opinion
which
is
set
forth
in
the
record
at
page
75
in
which
he
overruled
mr.
freedman's
federal
claims
and
which
he
denied
his
motion
for
acquittal.
and
he
then
convicted
mr.
freedman
and
he
fine
him
$25.
of
course
he
could
have
sent
him
to
jail
and
before
the
payment
of
the
fine.
to
put
the
matter
briefly,
the
trial
judge
held
that
the
appellant's
claims
with
foreclosed
by
this
court's
ruling
in
the
times
film
corporation
case,
365
u.s.
43.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
appellant's
conviction
and
that
opinion
is
set
forth
at
page
78
of
our
record
and
also
is
reported
at
197
a.
2nd
232.
also,
i
should
note
that
the
opinion
appears
as
an
appendix
to
our
jurisdictional
statement.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
like
the
trial
judge,
ruled
that
mr.
freedman
was
without
standing
to
attack
any
section
in
this
statute
other
than
section
2
under
which
he
had
been
indicted.
and
as
to
that
section,
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
this
court
had
foreclosed
the
issue
in
its
holding
in
the
times
film
case.
now,
however,
before
rendering
that
decision
or
rather
in
--
at
page
80
in
our
record,
we
quote
verbatim
from
a
portion
of
the
decision
of
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
because
we
believe
that
that
quotation
totally
undermines
the
asserted
applicability
of
the
times
film's
case
to
this
case.
i'd
like
to
read
from
page
80
of
our
record,
the
last
sentence
of
the
first
paragraph.
parenthetically,
it
is
noted
that
neither
the
appellant
nor
the
state
even
suggests
that
the
film
“revenge
at
daybreak”
would
violate
any
of
the
standard
set
out
in
the
statute.
and
the
state
has
conceded
that
it
would
have
been
approved,
had
it
been
submitted
for
licensing.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
no,
it
was
not,
your
honor.
i
was
coming
to
the
times
film
case
now.
and
we
believe
that
the
times
film
case
has
completely
presented
the
completely
different
proposition
to
this
court.
in
times
film,
the
petitioner
asked
for
a
federal
district
court
and
ultimately
this
court
for
total
judicial
protection.
i
mean
total
judicial
protection
against
the
chicago
ordinance
which
in
res
--
in
all
essential
respect
similar
to
this
statute
require
--
which
would
have
required
the
issuance
of
a
permit
to
show
a
film
called
“don
juan”,
or
in
the
alternative
to
enjoin
the
chicago
ordinance
--
the
chicago
authorities
from
preventing
in
showing.
however,
this
court
pointed
out
that
the
--
the
only
question
that
was
decided
was
whether
or
not,
this
court
should
grant
a
total
judicial
protection
to
the
showing
of
all
films.
i
should
like
to
read
from
this
court's
decision
in
the
times
film
case
to
point
--
to
point
out
what
we
consider
as
a
vital
distinction
between
the
times
film
case
and
the
freedman
case.
i'm
reading
now
from
page
46
and
47
of
the
times
film
decision.
moreover,
there
was
not
a
word
in
the
record
as
to
the
nature
and
content
of
“don
juan”.
we
are
left
entirely
in
the
dark
in
this
regard,
as
were
city
officials
and
other
reviewing
courts.
the
petitioner
claims
that
the
nature
of
the
film
is
irrelevant
and
that
even
if
this
film
contains
the
basic
type
of
pornography
or
incitement
to
riot
or
forceful
overthrow
of
the
government,
it
may
nonetheless
be
shown
without
prior
submission.
now,
it
was
on
those
premises
that
this
court
declined
to
require
a
federal
district
court
to
compel
the
state
authorities
to
issue
the
license.
in
short,
as
this
court
has
recently
observed
in
bantam
books
at
372
u.s.
58
in
--
in
a
footnote,
the
only
question
tended
to
this
court
in
the
times
film
case
was
whether
a
prior
restraint
was
necessarily
unconstitutional
under
all
circumstances.
now
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
we
--
we
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i'd
like
to
answer
that
question
this
way.
we
think
it
is
highly
relevant
that
mr.
freedman
showed
the
film
and
that
the
state
acknowledges
that
the
film
is
constitutionally
protected
because
it
is
our
view
that
at
that
point,
when
--
when
we
attempted
to
introduce
testimony
from
the
chief
reviewer
that
whereby
she
admitted,
she
would
have
had
admitted
had
she
been
permitted
to
answer,
that
this
film
was
constitutionally
protected
communication.
we
believe
at
that
point,
the
judge
should
have
dismissed
the
--
the
--
the
indictment.
and
that
mr.
freedman
at
that
point
should
have
been
free.
now
in
--
in
order
to
--
to
--
in
order
to
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well
--
well
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well
we
--
we
--
that
is
what
--
what
we
believe
the
--
that
was
being
alleged
in
the
times
film
case.
of
course,
i'd
like
to
say
at
the
outset
that
i
was
the
counsel
in
that
case
and
that
i
personally
feel
that
the
views
of
the
--
dissenter's
order
prevailed.
but
i
also
believe
that
the
position
that
mr.
freedman
is
here
taking
is
a
much
narrower
position
than
was
taken
in
times
film
case
because
we
have
here
as
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
because
we
have
a
situation
here
mr.
justice
goldberg
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
no,
we're
not
saying
that.
we
--
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
something
that
mr.
--
mr.
chief
justice
warren
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
the
times
film
case
which
i
believe
the
majority
of
the
court
did
not
address
itself
to
and
--
and
therefore,
i
may
suggest
that
it
might
had
been
a
point
which
the
majority
cannot
have
said
to
have
condoned.
i'd
like
to
read
from
page
65
and
66
of
the
times
film
decision
in
which
the
chief
justice
referred
--
referring
to
the
kingsley
books
case
pointed
out
what
we
consider
a
major
distinction
between
this
procedure
and
the
procedure
in
kingsley
books.
in
kingsley,
the
chief
justice
said,
the
person
enjoined
had
available
the
defense
that
the
written
or
printed
matter
was
not
obscene
if
an
--
if
an
attempt
was
made
to
punish
him
for
disobedient
of
the
injunction.
the
chicago
ordinance
admits
no
defense
in
the
prosecution
for
failure
to
procure
a
license
other
than
that
the
motion
picture
was
submitted
to
the
censor
and
a
license
was
obtained.
now,
as
has
been
so
dramatically
illustrated
in
this
case,
the
maryland
statute
like
the
chicago
ordinance
admits
no
such
defense.
in
short,
it
is
our
position
that
that
this
statute,
like
the
chicago
ordinance,
presents
exactly
the
pitfall
which
was
commented
upon
by
--
by
professor
paul
freund
to
whom
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
--
was
referring
when
he
wrote
the
--
his
decision
in
the
kingsley
books
case.
specifically,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
writing
that
kingsley
books
decision,
added
a
footnote
at
page
four
--
443
which
–
which
i
would
like
to
--
which
i
would
like
to
read
to
the
court
if
i
may
because
i
believe
it's
pertinent.
this
comparison
of
remedy
takes
note
of
the
fact
that
we
do
not
have
before
us
a
case
where
although
the
issue
of
obscenity
is
ultimately
decided
in
favor
of
the
bookseller.
the
state
nevertheless
attempts
to
punish
him
for
disobedience
of
the
interim
injunction.
for
all
we
know,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
concluded,
new
york
may
impliedly
condition
the
temporary
injunction
so
as
not
to
subject
the
bookseller
to
a
charge
of
contempt
if
he
prevails
on
the
issue
of
obscenity.
now,
this
is
precisely
the
--
what
we
believe
is
a
constitutional
pitfall
in
this
statute.
we
believe
that
it
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
i
would
say
mr.
justice
douglas
irrespective
of
whether
or
not
there
has
to
be
a
different
rule.
we
--
we
believe
that
whether
or
not,
there
could
be
a
different
rule
may
be
considered
in
whether
or
not
this
court
decides
to
reconsider
the
times
film
case
which
of
course
i
would
welcome
greatly.
however,
i
believe
that
once
it
is
established
that
a
motion
picture
is
permissible
constitutionally,
that
certainly
at
that
point,
the
rule
is
the
same
with
respect
to
any
medium
of
expression.
now,
professor
alexander
bickel
in
his
--
in
his
book
which
we
cite
at
page
38
and
39
of
our
brief
was
addressing
himself
to
that
very
point,
the
point
that
professor
freund
and
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
addressing
himself
to
in
the
kingsley
books
case
which
seems
to
be
unresolved
as
of
this
point.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
yes,
there
is
mr.
justice
goldberg.
that
is
the
long
way
which
is
urged
upon
mr.
freedman
by
the
maryland
state
board
of
censors.
in
effect,
they
said
--
they
said
to
--
they
say,
why
didn't
he
submit
his
film
and
then
if
we
would
have
refused
them
a
license,
and
then
he
can
appeal.
but
the
fact
is
that
anyone
who
knows
how
censor
boards
operate,
that
they
can
for
all
expense
and
purposes,
for
all
practical
intents
and
purposes,
they
can
just
lift
the
picture
out
of
circulation
and
we
all
know
that
it
takes
months
and
years
before
the
film
is
finally
vindicated.
i
may
add
that
the
batting
average
of
this
particular
censor
board
is
zero
in
every
instance
in
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
and
that
findings
of
bans
have
been
reversed.
but
this
takes
years.
and
as
a
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well
–-
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
that
--
that
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
that
is
--
that
is
true
and
that
is
--
and
that
is
the
state's
position.
but
of
course,
mr.
freedman
as
--
and
as
the
record
shows,
in
fact
99.7%
of
all
exhibitors
show
--
show
concededly
permissible
films.
the
point
is
that
mr.
freedman
decided
to
take
a
shortcut
here
because
he
felt
that
his
film
was
--
that
his
film
was
among
the
99.7%
of
permissible
film
which
the
average
annual
reports
of
the
state
board
show
--
are
shown
in
maryland.
he
just
felt
that
--
that
the
censor
board
are
not
to
be
allowed
to
play
russian
roulette
with
this
film
and
--
and
pull
the
trigger
and
then
his
film
might
never
be
shown.
and
in
fact,
i'd
like
to
refer
you,
mr.
justice
stewart
to
a
point
which
was
made
by
the
chief
justice
in
his
dissent
in
the
times
film
case
where
--
where
he
pointed
out
to
an
example
of
a
film
called
“the
miracle”
which
was
the
subject
in
the
burstyn
case
which
was
never
shown
in
chicago
because
of
precisely
this
point,
there
was
five
years
of
litigation
and
the
distributor
died,
and
the
film
was
after
five
years,
the
film
was
never
shown
when
it
was
finally
vindicated.
this
is
precisely
what
mr.
freedman
objected
to
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
and
you
have
to
assume
that
(voice
overlap)
because
it
was
never
shown.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
it
was
shown
mr.
justice
stewart
–-
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
--
that
the
film
was
shown.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
i
think
that
--
in
--
in
--
in
effect,
i
think
the
state
of
maryland
would
concede
90
--
every
film
that's
licensed
is
constitutionally
unobjectionable
which
would
entail
99.7%
of
all
prints
submitted
to
that
court.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
yes,
i
would
not
concede
that
this
is
a
business
tax,
mr.
justice
stewart.
if
--
if
the
state
of
maryland
were
to
enact
the
tax,
that
anyone
who
submits
$25
can
have
his
film
--
can
get
a
license
for
whatever
purpose.
if
there
were
some
valid
purpose
which
i
really
don't
know,
then
that
would
be
a
different
case
but
that
is
–
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well
raise
revenue
but
they're
doing
that
now.
i
think
they
have
a
state
tax,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
that
is
our
position,
mr.
justice
brennan.
if
this
court
finds
that
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well
of
course,
i
would
welcome
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
i
really
don't
think
it
does
involve
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
i
really
don't
think
it
entails
that
and
--
and
in
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
i
admit
mr.
justice
brennan
that
very
little
might
be
left
of
it,
but
if
the
state
would
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
something
might
be
(voice
overlap)
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
i
think
if
maryland
wants
to
keep
--
keep
up
this
type
of
scheme
to
--
to
pair
it
out
what
it
believes
to
be
the
infinite
decimal
--
infinite
decimal
portion
of
film
that
it
can
legitimately
keep
out
of
maryland,
i
believe
that
there
might
--
there
might
conceivably
be
some
people
who
would
sort
of
ban
insurance
policy
and
submit
but
i
don't
--
i
think
that
that
is
all
that
would
be
left
out.
but
i
think
that
the
initiative
ought
to
be
with
the
--
with
the
exhibitor
and
not
with
the
state.
i'm
not
saying
now
that
the
state
can't
use
this
method
or
some
other
valid
method
to
restrain
what
can
be
restrained
or
to
condemn
what
can
be
condemned.
and
we're
not
asking
for
total
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
it
would
still
be
a
mandate,
mr.
justice
brennan
if
on
a
judicial
determination,
the
film
turns
out
to
be
not
protected
but
we
do
not
think
that
it
should
be
a
mandate
if
--
if
the
film
turns
out
to
be
a
protected
film
which
happens
of
course
in
a
vast
majority
of
cases.
now,
i
would
like
to
state
that
--
to
say,
before
reserving
if
i
may
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal,
that
we
are
not
only
relying
on
the
first
amendment
in
this
case,
but
we
are
also
relying
on
the
case
of
gelling
versus
texas,
343
u.s.
960
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
there,
it
will
be
recalled
an
almost
analogous
situation
happened.
they
had
a
local
ordinance
pursuant
to
which
all
films
have
to
be
submitted.
and
this
case
was
decided
by
--
by
this
court
together
in
the
same
term
as
the
burstyn
case.
the
exhibitor
did
submit
the
film
and
the
film
was
turned
down.
then
he
did
not
take
the
review
which
the
--
which
the
censor
board
had
urged
him
to
do
but
instead
he
went
ahead
and
he
exhibited
the
film.
and
he
was
prosecuted
in
an
exact
similar
fashion
as
ronald
freedman
was
prosecuted
here.
he
was
prosecuted
for
failure
to
submit.
and
this
court
set
aside
the
--
the
conviction.
for
the
--
for
the
foregoing
reasons
and
for
other
reasons
that
have
urged
and
that
we've
set
forth
in
our
brief,
we
urge
this
court
to
--
to
reverse
ronald
freedman's
conviction.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
mr.
justice
white,
it's
our
position
that
the
state
has
criminally
convicted
a
man
he
--
for
--
for
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well
the
state
is
insisting
on
licensing
without
affording
a
chance
to
an
exhibitor
to
come
into
--
to
come
in
some
place,
the
court
or
some
place
to
--
and
show
that
the
film
is
--
is
not
obscene
or
is
protected.
i
think
that's
our
case.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
whether
or
not
they
knew,
they
--
they
--
it's
our
position
that
they
should
have
purported
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
whether
or
not,
they
knew
it's
our
position,
mr.
justice
white
that
they
should
afford
as
it
was
pointed
out
in
kingsley
books
and
as
it
was
pointed
out
by
the
chief
justice
in
his
dissent
of
the
times
film
case
that
at
some
point,
they
should
afford
an
exhibitor
who
does
show
a
film,
a
chance
to
come
in
and
prove
the
innocence
of
his
film,
constitutionally
speaking.
i
should
like,
if
i
may,
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
thank
you.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
addressing
myself
to
a
few
of
the
questions
which
some
of
the
justices
have
posed
me
a
little
further,
i
would
like
to
say
that
i
believe
that
if
the
view
of
the
attorney
general
of
maryland,
mr.
finan,
prevails
here
that
the
court
may
have
to
overrule
the
burstyn
case
because
he
cited
an
example
of
i
think
a
well
with
water.
and
i
recall
that
this
court
held
--
i
believe
it
was
in
smith
case
that
food
for
the
mind
and
food
for
the
belly
are
not
one
of
the
same
things.
i
should
also
like
to
state
that
i
--
well,
in
defending
ronald
freedman,
he
is
involved
in
the
motion
picture
business
and
i
resent
on
his
behalf
the
insinuation
that
--
that
what
he
wants
to
do
is
to
bring
or
what
anyone
else
wants
to
do
is
to
bring
a
lot
of
lewd
films
in
into
maryland.
i
believe
that
rests
from
the
completely
false
assumption
that
this
statute
in
fact
deters
people
from
presenting
obscene
films
to
the
board.
of
course,
this
is
entirely
conjectural
and
that
we
--
we
all
know
that
especially
with
the
statute
of
this
nature
which
is
censorship
outbreak
that
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
are
inhibited
and
who
may
bypass
maryland.
i
should
now
like
to
address
myself
to
the
--
the
question
on
--
that
justice
--
mr.
justice
goldberg
and
stewart
asked
me
about
in
connection
with
the
tax,
whether
this
--
this
could
be
sustained
if
it
were
a
tax.
the
fact
is
if
it
may
please
the
court,
that
--
that
this
is
not
an
ordinary
business
tax.
i
think
if
this
were
an
ordinary
business
tax,
this
court
could
be
confronted
by
an
entirely
different
problem.
we
think
that
this
is
a
specific
discriminatory
tax.
it
picks
out
one
constitutional
medium
and
motion
pictures
are
exactly
that.
in
a
real
sense,
this
is
a
tax
which
discriminates
against
a
particular
constitutional
right
just
as
maryland,
in
an
earlier
case,
well
over
hundred
years
ago
in
mcculloch
versus
maryland
sought
to
distinguish
against
the
federal
government.
and
of
course,
that
was
not
sustained.
now,
it
has
also
been
urged
by
the
attorney
general
here
of
maryland
that
to
reverse
freedman's
conviction
would
in
effect
require
for
this
court
to
overrule
times
film.
now,
we
do
not
believe
that
that
is
so.
we
think
that
a
--
to
overrule
times
film
would
dismantle
any
system
of
censorship
although
that
would
not
necessarily
itself
entail
to
--
total
judicial
protection
to
motion
pictures.
we
believe,
however,
that
we
have
a
much
narrower
case
here.
the
attorney
general
has
totally
ignored
the
fact
that
the
film
has
been
shown.
in
fact
he
has
insinuated
that
this
was
--
might
not
be
the
proper
way
to
--
for
mr.
freedman
to
test
his
beliefs
that
--
that
the
conviction
has
to
--
as
applied
to
him
is
invalid.
i
believe
in
that
context
that
ms.
thaw
(ph)
and
mr.
thomas,
and
many
of
the
other
cases
that
have
been
before
this
court
have
come
up
in
exactly
the
same
context.
we
believe
that
--
that
maryland
could
if
this
court
reverses
within
the
narrow
scope
of
this
--
that
this
movie
may
conceivably
entail
that
if
maryland's
brief
--
if
this
court
reverses,
we
believe
maryland
could
still
maintain
its
film
review
board
if
it
so
desire
to
do
so
for
all
those
as
i
have
suggested
before
who
want
to
buy
an
insurance
policy.
as
long
as
it
is
permissible
for
people
who
show
a
film
to
commit
--
who
do
not
want
to
comply
with
this
as
long
as
it
is
permissible
for
those
people
to
come
in
and
to
later
on
any
proceeding,
this
proceeding
or
any
other
state
proceeding
whether
it'd
be
criminal
or
an
injunctive
method
that
this
court
might
have
sustained,
that
the
exhibitor
may
come
in
and
that
it
may
be
able
to
show
that
this
particular
film
is
constitutional.
and
therefore,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
addressed
himself
to
in
his
concurrence
in
the
kansas
book
case
which
was
brought
up
before,
mr.
justice
stewart
said
that
the
books
involved
there
were
not
hardcore
pornography.
and
therefore
he
thought
that
kansas
could
not
by
any
procedure
constitutionally
suppress
him
anymore
than
kansas
could
constitutionally
make
their
sale
or
distribution
of
criminal
act.
we
believe
that
we
are
in
exactly
the
same
boat
here.
and
we
therefore
urge
this
court
to
reverse
ronald
freedman's
conviction.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
we
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
probably
very
little.
however,
i
would
like
to
dispute
in
passing
the
attorney
general
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
it's
--
it's
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
in
all
capability,
i
think
that
maryland
may
then
do
what
46
other
states
and
i
don't
think
it's
40
cities,
i
think
it's
only
two
cities
and
i
think
it's
only
2%
or
3%
of
our
population
and
not
50%
of
our
population.
what
the
--
what
the
courts
do
there?
what
the
states
do
there?
maryland
would
probably
resort
to
some
other
method
whether
injunctive
or
criminal
or
combination
of
both
but
a
method
that
has
been
validly
sustained
by
this
court.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
i
think
that
quite
a
few
states
these
days
have
injunctive
proceedings
such
as
that
they
have
been
sustained
in
the
kingsley
books,
your
honor.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
they
--
they
--
i
don't
think
they
apply
to
movies
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
no
new
york
does
not.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
they
--
they
might
not
find
to
see
the
problem
as
greatly
as
the
state
of
maryland
sees
it.
they
might
find
that
it's
quite
more
sufficient
to
invoke
the
traditional
american
process
against
the
exhibitors
of
films
--
allegedly
obscene
films.
they
might
find
it
easier
than
(voice
overlap)
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
i
mean
criminal
prosecution
but
i'm
not
saying
that
maryland
is
necessarily
relegated
to
that.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well
i
--
i
suggest
mr.
justice
that
--
that
--
that
is
even
more
difficult
with
respect
to
those
media
which
enjoy
a
far
greater
circulation
and
impact
than
the
motion
picture
medium
which
i
think
is
a
great
medium
and
i
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
i
don't
think
impact
has
any
constitutional
relevance.
no,
not
with
respect
to
those
films
which
are
constitutionally
protected.
but
i
do
suggest
that
in
the
states
--
in
the
46
states
that
--
that
follow
the
traditional
american
method,
that
they
have
an
easier
time
with
respect
to
prosecuting
for
allegedly
offensive
films
than
they
do
with
respect
to
magazines
that
are
disseminated
far
away.
and
of
course,
the
batting
average
of
the
maryland
board
of
appeals
has
been
zero.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
the
court
of
appeals
indeed
has
overruled
(voice
overlap)
one
or
two
years,
i've
had
a
few
cases
myself
before
the
court
took
me
two
years
in
this
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
they
have
three.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
because
the
exhibitors
possibly
made
it
perpetuated.
thank
you
very
much.
