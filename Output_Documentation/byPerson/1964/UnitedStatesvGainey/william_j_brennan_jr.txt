justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
that
he
did
so
charged
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
having
that
mere
presence
unexplained
is
sufficient
today,
would
you
say
that's
what
he
charged?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
defend
that
as
sufficient
instruction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that's
--
on
that
set
of
facts
and
the
language
of
the
cases
has
no
rational
connection?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
you
prevail
this
case
would
have
go
back
to
new
trial,
would
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
on
this
evidence,
do
you
suggest,
assuming
you
prevail
on
the
presumption
point,
on
this
evidence
do
you
suggest
there
would
not
still
be
a
case
for
the
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
bother,
i
won't
question
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
though?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
let
me
get
back
to
you
on
that
one.
are
you
saying
in
effect
this
--
that
on
the
basis
of
mere
possession,
congress
cannot
constitutionally
deny
the
defendant
the
right
to
a
judge's
decision
that
there's
no
jury
question?
as
i
gather
the
statute
now
on
the
basis
of
mere
possession
requires
the
judge
to
submit
for
the
jury's
determination
that
requires
to
find
guilt,
but
there
is
then
a
jury
question
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whereas,
that
is,
that's
the
effect
in
the
statue
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whereas
if
we
didn't
have
the
statute
or
the
judge
i
take
it
would
be
free
to
say
there's
no
jury
question
and
dismiss
the
indictment
against
the
defendant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that's
â€“
[inaudible]
against
you
on
this
on
the
whole
line
of
cases,
hasn't
that
sustained
the
right
of
congress
as
long
as
there's
so
called
rational
connection,
they
deprive
judges
the
right
to
withhold
the
cases
from
the
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
when
it
comes
down
is
that
the
congress
has
made
a
determination
based
on
experience,
that
if
there
is
a
certain
thing
in
this
instance
a
presence
that
supports
an
inference
of
ownership
or
whatever
it
may
be
of
the
particular
still
involved,
isn't
that
what
it
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
congress
has
made
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
is
the
reason
not
that
must
be
what
the
congress
says
or
thought
fit
to
do
with
it,
otherwise
why
would
they
create
it?
