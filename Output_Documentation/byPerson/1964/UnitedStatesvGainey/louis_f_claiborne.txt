mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
government
is
petitioning
from
a
ruling,
invalidating
two
so
called
statutory
presumptions
added
to
the
alcohol,
the
federal
alcohol
tax
law
in
1958.
to
state
the
underlying
facts
of
this
case
very
briefly,
in
march
of
1960,
federal
and
local
agents
were
staking
out
an
elicit
country
still
in
dooly
county,
georgia.
while
the
officers
were
waiting
there,
early
in
the
morning,
a
truck
arrived
carrying
the
three
petitioners.
one
of
them
got
out,
was
apprehended,
two
others
were
apprehended
in
the
truck
as
they
were
attempting
to
escape.
this
was
at
the
sight
of
the
still.
distill
was
going,
it
was
apparently
ready
to
produce
its
first
run.
on
the
truck,
a
butane
tank,
a
tank
of
butane
gas
was
found
which
matched
those
found
at
the
still
site.
shortly
after
the
arrest,
one
of
the
petitioners
admitted
that
the
still
belong
to
all
three
of
them
and
that
they
were
preparing
to
make
their
first
run
from
it
that
day.
and
finally,
the
owner
of
the
land
on
which
the
still
was
located
at
the
trial
testified
that
one
of
the
petitioners
had
approached
him
about
doing
a
little
business
down
by
the
creek.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
admission
by
the
petitioner
barrett,
your
honor,
was
made
after
the
arrest
and
apparently
very
shortly
after
the
arrest,
still
at
the
still
site.
the
testimony
of
the
landowner
was
at
the
trial
several
months
later.
all
three
of
the
petitioners
were
indicted
on
four
counts.
they
were
first
charged
with
possessing
an
unregistered
still,
secondly
with
carrying
on
the
business
of
a
distiller
without
having
posted
the
required
bond,
thirdly
with
carrying
on
the
business
of
the
distiller
with
intent
to
defraud
the
government
taxes
and
finally
in
the
fourth
count
with
working
at
an
unposted
distillery,
that
is
to
say
distillery
at
which
the
sign
displaying
the
name
and
occupation
of
the
owner
had
not
been
displayed.
at
the
trial,
there
was
directed
verdict
with
the
consent
of
the
government
as
to
the
so
called
working
count,
the
last
one
i've
described,
that
is
working
without
the
sign
being
posted.
the
judge
in
his
instructions
to
the
jury
and
this
is
where
the
heart
of
the
case
is
referred
to
the
presumptions
created
by
the
1958
amendments
to
the
statute.
he
explained
that
congress
had
recently
enacted
statutes,
which
permitted
the
jury
to
infer
from
presence
at
an
unregistered
still,
which
was
set
up
and
in
the
other
case
which
was
going,
that
those
found
there
were
in
fact
possessing
still,
all
were
in
fact
carrying
on
the
business
of
the
distiller
without
bond.
the
judge
however
was
very
careful
to
explain
to
the
jury
that
they
were
not
required
even
if
they
found
such
presence
and
even
if
they
found
such
presence
unexplained,
they
were
still
not
required
to
convict.
the
statute
merely
permitted
them
to
do
so
as
he
put
it
if
they
wished.
the
jury
did
convict
on
all
three
counts.
the
court
of
appeal
reversed
on
all
counts.
we're
only
concerned
with
the
first
two
counts,
however,
the
reversal
along
the
third
count,
distilling,
carrying
on
the
business
to
the
distiller
with
the
intent
to
be
fraud
the
government
is
not
included
in
our
petition
and
is
not
affected
by
the
presumptions
at
issue
here.
the
court
of
appeals
thought
the
two
presumptions
involved
were
unconstitutional
as
violating
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment,
but
before
going
any
further,
i
think
i
should
emphasize
several
things.
first,
though
there
was
clearly
ample
evidence
to
sustain
the
convictions
on
the
first
two
counts
without
any
reliance
on
the
presumptions
and
the
court
of
appeal
so
found
and
remanded
for
a
new
trail
as
to
the
first
two
counts.
we
do
not
here
make
any
harmless
error
argument.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
is
impossible
to
tell
to
what
extent,
if
any,
the
jury
relied
on
the
presumptions
in
finding
the
verdict
guilty
and
that
therefore,
if
the
presumptions
are
indeed
unconstitutional,
a
new
trial
is
in
order,
that
a
new
trial
is
permissible
since
there
was
sufficient
other
evidence.
on
the
other
hand,
we
find
out
that
there
was
a
general
sentence
as
to
all
three
petitioners
and
that
therefore,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
the
sentence
can
be
sustained
and
should
be
sustained
if
the
conviction
on
either
count
1
or
count
2
is
sustained,
that
is
to
say
if
either
of
the
presumptions
underlying
either
of
those
counts
is
sustained.
and
finally,
we
emphasize
that
the
two
presumptions
involved
here,
the
one
going
to
possession,
the
other
going
to
carrying
on
the
business
to
the
distiller
without
bond,
do
not
stand
or
fall
together.
we
view
them
quite
differently
and
as
i
hope
to
make
it
clear
and
as
i
think
our
brief
says
quite
forthrightly,
we
view
one
as
much
stronger
than
the
other
and
we
place
our
primary
reliance
on
that
presumption
which
operates
with
respect
to
the
substantive
offense
of
carrying
on
the
business
without
bond
rather
than
on
the
presumption
dealing
with
possession
of
an
elicit
still.
the
presumptions
involved
that
i
already
described
that
i
should
state
them
a
little
more
in
detail.
first,
the
statute
says
that
as
to
anyone
found
present
at
the
sites
of
an
unregistered
still,
which
is
set
up,
that
is
to
say
which
is
ready
for
operation,
the
jury
may
infer
that
he,
the
person
found
there,
is
the
possessor
of
the
illicit
still,
if
that
person
does
not
satisfactorily
in
their
view
explain
his
presence.
the
second
presumption
is
that
as
to
anyone
found
at
the
site
of
an
elicit
still
which
is
not
only
set
up,
but
which
is
also
going,
the
jury
is
entitled
to
infer
that
that
person
is
carrying
on
the
business
or
of
course
aiding
and/or
abetting
in
carrying
on
the
business
of
a
distiller
without
bond
and
as
i
say
it
is
as
to
the
second
presumption
that
we
feel
we
have
a
stronger
and
a
clear
case.
the
standard
under
which
these
presumptions
are
to
be
tested
are
not
really
in
dispute.
i
think
the
rule
is
so
well
settled
by
decisions
of
this
court
that
no
issue
of
it
is
made
here.
the
basic
test
as
reiterated
in
those
decisions
is
that
there
must
be
some
rational
connection
between
the
fact
proved,
a
fact
which
gives
rise
to
the
operation
of
the
presumption
and
the
fact
inferred,
the
ultimate
fact,
in
light
of
common
experience.
in
judging
the
presumptions
here
because
they
all
created
by
congress
and
because
they
are
not
merely
permissible
inferences
which
a
court
finds
reasonable
if
made
by
a
jury,
there
is
a
special
difference
due
to
the
congressional
judgment.
but
the
question
merely
is,
was
it
reasonable
for
congress
to
suppose
that
a
jury
might
reasonably
infer
from
presence
under
the
stated
circumstances
that
the
person
found
there
was
aiding
and
abetting
in
the
distilling
without
bond.
we
recognize
also
of
course
that
the
presumptions
must
not
operate
in
such
a
way
as
to
deprive
the
defendant
of
his
privilege
not
to
take
the
stand
or
otherwise
place
him
at
an
unfair
disadvantage.
i
should
emphasize
that
the
presumptions
we're
dealing
with
here
are
merely
permissive,
not
only
are
they
rebuttable
presumptions,
but
they're
permissive
in
the
sense
as
the
judge
clearly
instructed
here,
they're
none
binding
on
the
jury.
he
tells
them,
“if
you
find
these
people
were
present
and
if
you
are
not
satisfied
with
their
explanation,
you'd
still
need
not
convict
them,
but
you
may
do
so.”
the
explanation
referred
to
in
the
statute
is
also
quite
clear.
it
was
quite
clearly
charged
in
this
case,
need
not
come
from
the
defendant
himself.
there
was
a
suggestion
that
the
defendant
must
himself
take
the
stand
to
rebutt
the
inference
that
arises.
that
rebuttal
may
come
from
any
evidence
he
chooses
to
introduce,
many
witnesses
that
may
put
on.
indeed
it
may
come
from
any
circumstances
in
the
case,
including
the
government's
own
evidence.
there
well
be
that
the
government's
proof
will
show
circumstances
which
on
their
face
explain
the
presence
of
the
defendant
site
and
from
the
very
start
make
the
inference
impossible
or
unlikely.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
the
second
circuit
case
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
there
is
a
clear
decision
to
the
contrary
in
the
six
circuit,
but
it
is
a
per
curiam
opinion.
i
believe
it's
the
phillips
case
cited
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
but
the
second
circuit
case
dealt
not
with
either
of
the
presumptions.
well,
it
may
also
dealt
with
these,
it
dealt
also
with
the
different
presumption,
one
that
there
is
an
operation.
perhaps
this
is
the
opportune
moment
to
say
that
the
opinion
below
insofar
as
it
deals
with
the
presumption,
we
are
primarily
talking
about
here
that
is
carrying
on
the
business
of
the
distiller
without
bond
is
indefensible
on
its
face
in
this
respect.
the
opinion
deals
primarily
with
the
irrationality
of
presuming
that
a
man
present
is
the
possessor
of
the
still
taking
a
very
narrow
view
of
possession
and
basing
its
narrow
view
of
possession
on
this
court's
decision
in
bozza
which
as
i
shall
try
to
explain
later,
we
think
was
legislatively
altered
or
overruled.
but
from
that
premise,
that
presence
is
not
the
proper
predicate
for
an
inference
of
possession.
it
then
goes
on
to
say,
a
fortiori
presence
cannot
bring
us
to
an
inference
of
carrying
on
the
business
of
the
distiller
assuming
that
the
necessary
intermediate
link
is
a
finding
of
possession.
in
other
words,
assuming
that
one
carries
on
the
business
has
to
be
a
possessor.
in
viewing
that,
it
expressly
ignores
this
court's
holding
in
bozza
where
the
court
found
as
to
the
defendant
that
whereas
he
was
not
a
possessor,
he
was
carrying
on
the
business
of
the
distiller.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that's
altogether
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that's
altogether
accurate,
yes
sir.
to
begin,
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
case
in
terms
of
what
is
something
of
a
hypothetical.
i
think
my
opponent
concedes
that
everyone
likely
to
be
found
at
the
site
of
an
illicit
still
is
probably
guilty
of
violating
some
section
or
other
of
the
alcohol
tax
law.
there
is
very
little
case
to
be
made
for
the
stray
hunter
of
the
accidental
fisherman
who
wanders
inadvertently
onto
the
premises.
the
reasons
why
this
is
unlikely
and
i
think
my
opponent
recognizes
it,
is
that
stills
are
located
in
isolated
places.
every
effort
is
made
by
the
operators
to
keep
away
strangers.
a
very
stiff
penalty
is
imposed
on
anyone
in
anyway
contacted,
in
contact
with
the
still
discourage
strangers
from
coming
near
the
still
and
it
does
encourage
those
who
are
there
for
business
reasons
to
keep
potential
witnesses
at
a
minimum
and
therefore
to
discourage
and
frighten
away
anyone
who
happens
close
by.
so,
what
we're
really
talking
about
is
the
problem
of
those
who
are
there,
who
are
guilty
of
violating
some
section
of
the
alcohol
tax
law
and
the
question
is
whether
it
is
fair
to
charge
them
with
violating
the
particular
section
that
deals
with
carrying
on
the
business
of
the
distiller
without
bond.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
unless
i
miss
something
in
your
honor's
question,
it
seems
to
me
that,
that
is
in
effect
what
the
judge
did
charge.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
there
--
the
statute
requires
the
judge
did
set
me
of
making
clear
the
jury
that
the
defendant
had
an
opportunity
for
explanation
or
as
he
was
careful
to
add
the
case
itself
may
explain
their
presence.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
it
--
mr.
justice
black,
if
the
court
had
implied
that
the
only
possible
explanation
was
one
from
the
defendant's
own
lips,
then
i
think
we
would
have
a
serious
problem
under
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
clause,
but
since
it
was
clear
that
the
explanation
need
not
come
from
the
defendant
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
with
taking
--
it
is
i
think
it's
correct
to
say,
mr.
justice
black,
that
the
judge
charged
that
unexplained
presence
was
sufficient
to
convict.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
making
it
clear
that
unexplained
means
unexplained
by
any
evidence
in
the
case
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
--
well,
in
a
[voice
overlap]
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
what
he
ultimately
charged.
he
previously
charged
that
mere
presence
was
insufficient,
but
then
when
he
arrived
at
the
statute,
i
think
he
follows
the
statute
and
he's
compelled
to
say
as
he
did
“you're
permitted
to
convict
on
a
mere
finding
of
presence
provided
that
the
explanation
furnished
by
the
evidence,
any
part
of
the
evidence,
is
unsatisfactory
in
your
view.”
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
do.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
do,
especially
as
applied
to
the
crime,
the
substantive
offense
of
carrying
on
the
business
of
the
distiller
without
bond,
but
the
main
thrust
of
our
argument
is
that
that
crime
is
a
very
broad
one,
not
a
narrow
one.
the
mere
fact
that
the
alcohol
tax
law
is
in
a
great
exorbitant
number
of
sections
and
that
one
is
tempted
to
view
it
as
isolating
the
different
faces
and
aspects
of
the
illicit
distilling
business
does
not
hold
up
on
examination.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
redundancy
in
the
statute
which
is
largely
explained
in
terms
of
the
history
of
the
statute.
some
of
these
sections
derived
from
the
original
tax
law
of
1791.
two
provisions
in
suit
here,
the
two
substantive
provisions
in
suit
here
are
derived
from
the
tax
law
of
1868.
it
is
quite
understandable
that
there
would
be
a
certain
amount
of
overlapping.
some
of
the
crimes
are
very
narrow
and
specific.
others
are
obviously
broader
and
overlap
some
of
these
narrow
crimes.
in
bozza,
this
court
found
that
possession
was
a
narrow
crime
and
that
making
mash
was
a
narrow
crime,
but
indicated
that
it
viewed
the
crime
comparable
to
the
one
here
as
a
broad
one,
that
is
to
say
carrying
on
the
business
of
a
distiller
with
intent
to
defraud
the
government.
the
jurisprudence
under
the
–
broad
in
the
sense
that
it
includes
a
host
of
activities
and
of
factors
unlike
the
crime
of
making
mash
for
instance,
which
applies
only
to
those
directly
connected
with
that
particular
phase
of
the
operation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
are
decisions
holding
a
customer,
at
least
the
customer
in
the
sense
of
a
distributor,
whether
an
individual
purchasing
one
bottle
at
the
still
site,
which
is
not
a
common,
so
we
are
informed
that
it's
a
common
occurrence,
would
be
viewed
as
aiding
and
abetting
as
perhaps
a
closer
question.
but
one
who
takes
on
the
stock
of
the
distillery
to
--
though
he
purchases
it,
and
doesn't
act
as
agent
for
the
still
owner
for
distribution,
we
view
as
an
essential
part,
an
essential
person
in
the
operation
in
the
distilling
business
and
therefore,
properly
thought
of
as
one
who
aids
and
abets
the
business.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it's
difficult
to
draw
a
line
as
to
how
much
the
court
is
entitled
to
or
should
accept
on
the
representations
of
the
experience
of
the
alcoholic
tax
unit.
we
do
say
in
our
brief
and
i
assume
we
had
no
reason
not
to
do
so
that
the
experience
of
tax
administrators
who
handled
this
problem
commonly
is
that
the
stills
are
well
guarded
and
that
no
unnecessary
person
is
encouraged
or
permitted
to
come
on
to
the
site
and
that
the
practice
as
noted
by
the
forces
of
the
law
is
that
the
customers
are
not
commonly
found
there.
i
suppose
this
could
be
documented
in
terms
of
arrest
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
i
don't
think
we
can
say
that
congress
focused
specifically
on
who
would
or
who
would
not
be
at
the
still
site.
i
do
think
it's
fair
to
assume
that
congress
as
a
whole
was
aware
of
the
way
these
operations
are
conducted.
they've
been
conducted
in
this
country
since
whiskey
rebellion.
it's
no
secret
and
i
think
we
must
impute
to
congress
the
knowledge
that
very
few
innocent
persons
are
likely
to
be
found
at
the
still
site.
my
position
is
that
it
would
have
been
plainly
proper,
there
would
have
been
a
clear
rational
connection
between
saying
presence
equals
guilt
under
the
alcohol
tax
law.
the
question
here
is
whether
carrying
on
the
business
of
the
distiller
is
a
sufficiently
broad
offense
to
embrace
most
of
those
involved
in
violating
the
alcohol
tax
law.
it
seems
to
us
the
cases
so
hold.
the
decision
of
this
court
in
bozza
suggests
as
much
and
that
the
very
words
defining
that
crime
are
much
broader
than
as
contrasted
to
making
mash
for
instance,
carrying
on
the
business
of
a
distiller
is
a
sort
of
crime,
a
sort
of
definition
that
lends
itself
to
a
much
broader
application
especially
in
view
of
the
aider
and
abettor
statute
at
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
–
i
don't
think
the
court
need
to
go
any
further.
i
don't
say
that
we
wouldn't
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that's
correct,
but
we
would
certainly
be
content
with
a
ruling
on
the
first
count
alone
or
on
the,
it
turns
out
to
be
the
second
count
below.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
mr.
justice
black,
it
seems
to
me
they
have
gone
less
far
in
intruding
on
the
function
of
the
jury
when
they
establish
a
mere
rebuttable
presumption
than
they
would
if
they
enlarge
the
substantive
offense
and
left
no
leeway
to
the
jury.
thus,
here
for
instance
it
is
conceivable
that
presence
at
the
site
of
a
still
might
have
been
made
a
crime
leaving
nothing
to
the
jury,
but
finding
a
presence.
instead
they
said
to
the
jury,
“you
may,
if
you
choose,
but
we
do
not
tell
you
must
deduce
or
infer
from
presence
another
crime.”
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
–
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
oh
it
does.
it
does
have
in
effect
and
i
recognize
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that's
all
it
does.
now
i've
–
i
have.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
black,
i
must
refer
to
that.
i
think
that
several
decisions
of
this
court
which
make
it
clear
that
it
is
a
proper
function
of
congress
to
legislate
in
the
area
of
presumptions
and
inferences
and
in
tot
itself
the
court
indicated
that
congress
might
go
further
in
screening
rationality
than
a
jury
on
its
own
could
be
permitted
to
do.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
they
haven't
altogether
limited
it,
because
they've
left
it's
merely
permissive
and
the
jury
is
not
instructed
that
it
must
convict
on
this
evidence
and
to
that
extent,
there
is
the
difference
between
enlarging
the
crime
and
merely
creating
a
presumption,
leaving
out
the
question
of
rebuttabilty.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they
deferred
if
one
wishes
to
the
jury
by
letting
the
jury
decide
whether
in
a
given
case
presence
should
be
a
crime.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
whether
it
is
a
crime.
