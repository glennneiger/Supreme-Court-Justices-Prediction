distill
is
unlawful
and
unregistered,
it's
being
operated
in
violation
of
the
law
and
the
evidence
also
shows
the
defendant
was
present
there,
that
is
enough
for
you
to
convict
him
for
that
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
judge
went
further
and
it
seems
to
me
like
it
separated,
i
doubt
if
any
judge
would
let
the
verdict
stand.
the
only
fact
of
the
connection
was
that
the
still
was
found
and
somebody
was
there
as
although
nothing
else
in
the
world,
he's
there.
that
would
raise
a
question
of
sufficiency
of
proof,
but
here,
the
judge
asked,
unless
he
explains
it
or
somebody
explains
the
authority,
that
raises
another
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
he
–
could
he
discourage
him?
it
seems
he
didn't
get
on
the
stand
to
explain
it,
you
have
a
right
to
convict
him
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
said
he
hadn't
left
any
indication.
the
fellow
could
have
gotten
on
the
stand
and
testified
getting
the
remaining
part
of
it
and
what
he
said
was
mere
--
as
i
understand
this
practically
speaking,
maybe
alright,
i
don't
deal
much
in
the
word
presumption,
i
can't
do
something
like
calling
it
the
presumption
that
you
couldn't
do
without
it,
but
it
seems
to
me
it
was
in
effect
you
said
was,
the
presence
of
the
still
is
enough
to
convict
unless
it's
explained
either
by
the
defendant
about
some
other
facts
[inaudible]
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i've
read
at
page
45.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
to
go
through
[inaudible]
in
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
claiborne
my
trouble
with
the
whole
thing
not
merely
this
presumption
but
others.
in
the
criminal
cases,
as
i
expressed
in
officially
in
my
[inaudible]
is
this.
how
can
the
congress
create
either
a
rebuttable
or
irrebuttable
presumption,
you
wish
to
call
it,
there
are
inferences
that
have
to
be
shown
without
intruding
on
the
function
of
the
jury
to
make
that
decision
entirely
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
make
my
idea
clear.
what
i
cannot
see
is
why
congress
has
done
anything
in
that.
if
there
was
a
sufficient
inference
to
support
a
judgment,
they
–
the
cong
--
the
jury
doesn't
have
to
be
told
by
congress
that
it
may
consider
that
inference.
it
can
consider
it
by
itself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
how
can
it
--
can
the
congress
legitimately
in
our
system
of
government
pass
a
law
that
forbids
a
judge
to
set
aside
the
verdict
of
guilty
if
he
believes
that
the
evidence
was
not
sufficient
in
the
court
below.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
not
think
those
cases,
any
of
them
have
canvassed
and
concerted
the
effect
of
letting
the
legislative
branch
intrude
in
this
field
with
reference
of
the
trial
of
a
defendant.
they
can
prescribe
the
law,
but
how
can
they
prescribe
a
rule
that
tells
the
jury
“you
must,
you
may
or
you
shall
convict
or
not
convict
on
this
evidence”
unless
you
want
to
say
that
in
doing
that
they
have
limited
the
scope
of
the
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
it's
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
why
the
two
get
mixed
up,
that's
what
bothers
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
even
if
he
explains
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you're
right
in
that
argument,
then
could
the
judge
review
his
verdict
is
guilty
stand
even
without
the
presumption
–
forget,
suppose
congress
has
passed
no
presumption.
you're
simply
arguing
if
there's
no
evidence
to
show
that
he
is
guilty
and
you
say
that
congress
had
no
right
to
say
that
there
is
no
evidence
to
show
he
is
guilty
it's
a
--
has
no
right
to
say
while
you
are
presuming
he
is
guilty
unless
he
explains
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
can't
do
that
could
a
jury
convict
on
that
and
that
alone.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
what
i'm
saying
is
–-
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
is
–-
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
is
not
enough
evidence
to
convict,
the
jury
–
the
congress
don't
have
a
right
to
say
you
presume
he's
guilty
if
he
doesn't
explain
it.
could
it
[inaudible]
you
stated
for
the
jury
convict
so
that
the
court
would
be
justified
and
let
the
convict
stand?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
you're
arguing?
you're
saying
that
neither
can
congress
pass
a
law
making
any
presumption?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
does
indirectly
if
i
say
it
was
a
presumption
which
can
be
explained.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
that's
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
law
have
evolved
the
system
under
which
the
legislative
branch
can
create
crime,
only
the
trial
of
a
court
in
bringing
back
the
conviction
and
here,
you
have
a
distinction,
legislature
and
[inaudible]
say
that
this
extent
is
not
up
to
the
court.
we
are
saying
here
to
have
this
effect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
alright,
but
you
think
he
has
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
[inaudible]
have
in
effect
at
the
difficulty
in
what
way?
you
mean
they
weren't
given
enough
conviction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happened
from
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
–
i
don't
quite
understand
with
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
complaint
there
was
that
the
judges
in
reviewing
the
evidence
to
see
whether
there
was
enough
to
convict,
would
not
hold
that
was
enough?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
really
arguing
on
the
basis
of
the
tot
holding,
aren't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
forget
the
legal
language,
legal
language
sometimes
is
confusing
–-
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
we
had
there
was
a
congress
view
of
presumption
that
[inaudible]
from
the
mere
presence
only
possession
of
a
gun,
that
was
enough
to
show
he
has
been
[inaudible],
was
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
had
to
be
convicted
prior
to
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
our
court
held
that
they
couldn't
convict
on
this
evidence.
what
you're
saying
here
that
there's
no
more
right
to
draw
the
inference
from
mere
presence
at
least
in
some
circumstances
without
more
than
there
was
in
that
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
certain
to
say,
he
didn't
explain
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
have
more
than
presence
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
haven't
found
barrel
or
something
like
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
that
changed
in
the
situation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
you
didn't
quite
answer
justice
brennan's
question.
i
didn't
quite
get
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
is
there,
it
is
there.
the
old
system
has
grown
up
in
this
statute
maybe
not
--
maybe
the
constitution
doesn't
require
it
under
due
process
clause,
the
evidence
of
criminal
cases,
the
evidence
will
be
given
to
the
jury,
they
still
have
the
right
to
draw
in?
the
system
has
also
grown
up
along
by
the
signs
of
it,
that
if
the
court
does
not
agree
with
the
jury,
the
judge
does
not
agree
with
the
jury,
he
can
set
that
judgment
to
aside
that
being
a
judicial
matter.
now,
what
would
be
the
effect
here
if
the
jury
did
convict
on
nothing
in
the
world
but
possession?
the
trial
judge
reached
the
conclusion
that
there
is
no
right,
no
connection
between
the
two,
quite
contrary
to
congress,
could
he
set
it
aside?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
i
mean
the
constitution
gives
him
a
right
to
go
contrary
to
them
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
would
do
that,
if
he
did
so,
wouldn't
he
be
going
contrary
to
the
command
of
congress
if
that
was
enough?
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
there's
nothing
in
the
world
but
possession?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
how
could
we
do
it
if
the
congress
had
said
that's
enough?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
we
would
have
to
invalidate
the
act,
the
congressional
act,
before
he
could
do
it.
so,
the
congress
has
said,
there
is
a
rational
connection.
but
when
he
says
there
is
not
a
rational
connection,
he
has
to
invalidate
the
act,
doesn't
he?
