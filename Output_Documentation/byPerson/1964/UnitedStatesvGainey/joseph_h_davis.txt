mr.
joseph
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice
associate
justices,
we
might
address
ourselves
at
first
to
the
fact
that
it
might
be
said
that
this
is
ordinary
whiskey
case
or
we
say
that
in
the
district
court
where
these
cases
are
usually
tried
as
just
another
liquor
case,
but
it
is
not.
and
what
disturbs
the
respondents
in
this
case
is
the
fact
that
in
effect
congress
has
said
that
“if
you
are
there,
it's
enough
to
convict
you
of
this
or
any
number
of
other
offenses
under
the
law.”
now
we
take
the
position,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
this
is
clearly
unconstitutional.
of
course,
the
facts
in
this
case
are
such
as
i
think
we
would
probably
have
to
concede
that
they
did
not
need
the
presumption
statute
in
this
case,
and
probably
used
this
for
charging,
because
you
can't
dispute
the
fact
that
4:30
in
the
morning
out
in
the
rural
area
under
these
circumstances
gives
a
natural
inference
to
something.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
if
it's
constitutional
they
have
a
duty
to
charge
them
and
that
was
what
done
in
this
instance,
although
i
think
the
trial
judge
probably
covered
other
areas
in
his
charge
what
would
have
been
sufficient,
had
the
presumption
been
left
out
or
put
in
insofar
as
giving
the
jury
an
adequate
picture
of
what
they
must
do
to
sustain
a
conviction.
but
our
point
is
this,
that
we're
not
particularly
talking
about
gainey,
barrett,
and
johns
in
this
case
at
4:30
in
the
morning,
we
are
talking
about
whether
or
not
the
congress
can
say
that
there
is
a
rational
connection
between
the
presumption
or
between
the
establishment
of
this
fact
and
this
inferred
fact.
now,
i
think
that
is
the
only
way
that
this
statute
can
be
upheld,
that
there
is
a
rational
connection
between
the
inference
of
possession
as
gleaned
from
the
proof
of
presence,
mere
presence.
now,
we
are
not
talking
about
presence
coupled
with
admissions.
we're
not
talking
about
presence
coupled
with
a
knocking
on
a
still
head
or
doing
this
or
doing
that.
we're
talking
about
mere
presence
as
if
the
man
were
sitting
over
there
literally
on
a
log
watching
an
operation
in
full
progress.
now,
is
there
a
rational
connection
under
the
case
of
this
court
between
the
establishment
of
that
one
small
fact
of
mere
presence
and
on
the
one
hand
possessing
a
still
or
carrying
on
the
business
of
a
distiller
or
some
eight
or
nine
other
areas.
the
government
seems
to
tell
us
that
there's
a
rationality
here
because
you
have
on
one
hand
the
establishment
of
presence
and
it
can
lead
into
one
of,
i
think
11
different
directions
concerning
the
operation
of
a
still.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
we
only
have
two
of
them,
but
i
mention
that
for
this
point,
sir.
presence
of
a
stolen
automobile,
recently
stolen
automobile
is
one
thing.
that
presence
cannot
be
used
to
say
or
to
infer
that
you
not
only
stole
this
automobile,
but
you
did
this
or
you
did
that
or
you
did
eight
or
nine
other
crimes.
possession
of
opium
or
marijuana
cannot
be
said
to
say
that
not
only
did
you
receive
it
unlawfully
or
obtained
it
on
unmarked
container
and
so
forth,
but
there
are
eight
or
ten
other
laws
that
you
are
guilty
of
because
you
merely
posses
this.
we
don't
have
that
in
those
situations
and
so
you
have
a
reasonable
inference
from
the
possession
of
recently
stolen
property
to
the
fact
that
it's
a
guilty
possession
if
you
please.
but
here,
just
the
mere
presence
at
a
table
for
instance
where
several
other
people
are
present,
that
fact
alone
can
cause
you
to
--
under
the
statute
here
to
go
into
several
different
directions.
that
is
our
point
as
in
opposition
to
the
government's
view
that
there's
a
rational
connection
between
the
fact
proved
and
the
inference
to
be
drawn.
now,
the
government
would
have
us
to
--
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
i
think
that
would
probably
help
the
government's
position,
mr.
justice
white,
but
--
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
i
would
because
mere
presence
can
be
a
guilty
presence
if
you
please
or
an
innocent
presence.
there
are
so
many
reasons
why
a
person
could
be
at
a
particular
point
at
a
given
time.
now,
presence
--
i
would
like
to
say
this,
presence
in
the
sense
that
we
are
talking
about
that
is
mere
presence
without
anything
else
we
say
would
be
insufficient
to
warrant
the
inference
that
this
man
sitting
here,
not
doing
anything
is
carrying
on
the
business.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
he
is
at
a
still,
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
no
sir,
but
some
are.
now,
--
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
pardon?
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
in
the
bozza
case,
bozza
himself
was
present
down
in
the
basement
carrying
only
operation,
but
not
upstairs
making
the
mash.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
on
possession.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
no
sir,
not
on
operation,
but
it
help
us
in
this
sense
that
we
noted
that
the
government
in
that
case
conceded
that
the
facts
and
circumstances
running
bozza's
operation
that
were
insufficient
to
charge
him
with
possession
and
with
making
mash.
now,
making
mash,
i
submit
or
--
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
the
operation
itself
--
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
mr.
justice
white,
we
had
more
than
mere
presence
in
bozza.
we
had
the
testimony
of
the
co-defendant
that
he
came
by
two
or
three
times
a
week
and
helped
me.
we
had
testimony
in
that
case
showing
that
he
used
his
car
on
convoy
purposes.
we
don't
have
any
testimony
that
bozza
himself
was
merely
sitting
in
that
room
in
a
rocking
chair
while
the
still
was
in
operation
in
the
basement,
had
that
been
the
question
i
think
it
would
have
been
a
serious
point
as
well
that
he
was
carrying
on
the
business.
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
crux
of
the
respondent's
position
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
by
and
large,
that
probably
would
be
--
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
no
sir,
we
have
to
concede
of
course
and
accept
certain
presumptions
as
being
constitutional.
they
are,
they've
been
ruled
on
by
this
court,
but
here
we
would
--
but
in
those
instances,
i
believe
we
were
talking
about
one
particular
thing.
here,
congress
has
seen
fit
to
divide
this
operation
into
a
multitude
of
things.
now,
if
they
want
to
eliminate
every
statute
on
the
book
pertaining
to
the
operation
or
manufacture
of
a
moonshine
whiskey,
if
it
pleases
the
court,
except
that
nobody
shall
carry
on
the
business
of
a
distiller,
and
whoever
is
present
at
that
scene
--
no
i
will
not
go
so
far
as
whoever
is
present
at
the
scene
can
be
reasonably
inferred
to
have
some
connection
with
it
to
the
extent
of
proven
of
guilt
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
i
still
say
that
even
then
a
presumption
would
be
unlawful,
because
--
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
i
don't
--
i
do
not
think
that
there
would
be
a
rational
connection
because
if
congress
should
do
that
and
if
it
followed
its
reasoning
in
the
legislative
history
in
this
instance,
the
purpose
seems
to
have
been
to
overrule
bozza,
that's
what
they
specifically
say.
now,
what
human
experience
or
what
experience
of
any
kind
do
they
have
at
that
time?
i
submit
that
they
had
the
fifth
circuit
which
consistently
held
that
presence
alone
is
insufficient.
they
had
holdings
in
the
third
circuit
which
seemed
to
hold
generally
that
presence
was
insufficient.
however,
in
the
fourth
circuit,
there
were
decisions
to
the
effect
of
presence
was
sufficient.
so,
the
human
experience
or
the
experience
or
the
history
that
congress
had
at
the
time
was
a
state
of
flux
between
the
circuits
and
yet
they
want
us
now
to
accept
the
fact
that
this
is
a
reasonable,
rational
connection,
because
it's
based
upon
human
experience
and
events
as
we
know
of
it.
we
submit
that
even
under
the
rational
connection
theory
that
the
statute
would
have
to
fall
because
mere
presence
at
a
still
at
any
other
illegal
operation
in
and
of
itself,
we
do
not
think
is
sufficient
or
is
a
crime,
i
will
put
it
that
way.
and
not
being
a
crime,
i
think
that
we
have
to
protect
the
great
--
very,
very
minute
minority
if
you
please
who
might
be
there
as
a
purchaser
as
one
who
went
down
with
his
friend
at
4
o'clock
in
the
morning
after
a
party
to
see
what
was
going
on,
but
his
mere
presence
is
deemed
to
be
sufficient
to
sustain
a
conviction
of
guilt.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
he
could,
but
we
take
the
position,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
he
doesn't
have
to.
that
the
burden
is
always
on
the
government
to
prove
his
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
they
can't
take
mere
presence
and
say
you
are
guilty.
because
the
case
could
be
prosecuted
within
a
very,
very
few
minutes.
we
found
the
still
in
such
and
such
a
time,
john
doe,
was
sitting
there
on
a
bench
at
4
o'clock
in
the
morning.
if
he
elects
to
remain
silent
for
reasons
best
known
to
himself
whether
or
not
he's
had
a
conviction,
otherwise
unrelated
to
this
for
income
tax
evasion
or
anything
unrelated
to
the
manufacture
of
illicit
whiskey,
granted
he
suffers
a
peril
of
remaining
silent,
but
to
get
on
the
stand
and
explain
why
he
was
there
at
04:30
in
the
morning
even
though
it
be
an
innocent
explanation,
would
be
practically
destroyed
by
the
fact
that
two
years
before
he
served
time
in
penitentiary
running
down
somebody,
say
an
involuntary
manslaughter
case.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
that's
true.
yes,
sir.
and
getting
back
again
to
our
initial
statements
that
congress
did
not
need
this
presumption,
that
they
have
as
one
counsel
said
yesterday
in
the
argument
in
a
totally
unrelated
case.
they
have
had
an
amazing
amount
of
success
in
this
moonshine
whiskey
cases.
in
the
state
of
my
place,
i
have
prosecuted
them
for
six
years
myself
in
u.s.
attorney's
office
and
i've
tried
to
defend
them
against
these
charges
of
presumption
statute.
but
they
have
had
an
amazing
amount
of
success,
because
under
the
usual
run
of
circumstances
they
have
enough
to
sustain
a
conviction
of
guilt
of
this
so
called
illicit
distilling
statute.
and
what
they
want
to
do
apparently
is
just
to
nail
down
that
one
area
and
to
eliminate
by
arbitrary
inference
the
consistent
holdings
of
two
of
the
circuits
about
mere
presence.
their
remedy
is
not
to
presume
a
man
guilty
whether
it's
permissive,
rebuttable,
conclusive
or
not.
the
point
is
to
--
we
say
that
the
enforcement
agencies
with
some
self-restrain
could
wait
two
minutes
and
let
the
man
get
out
of
the
truck
and
start
unloading
the
butane
gas
tank.
i'll
let
him
start
doing
this
or
doing
that
and
that
is
our
point,
that
the
remedy
lies
not
in
presumptively
making
a
man
come
forward
at
his
peril.
that's
of
course
be
self
incrimination
phase
of
it,
but
that
is
a
part
and
parcel
of
this
transaction.
but
under
the
circumstances
as
this
case
has
been
laid
and
as
the
charge
below
reflected,
there
can
be
no
rational
connection
between
mere
presence
at
the
scene
of
a
particular
thing
because
we
have
too
many
different
areas
that
that
inference
could
lead
to
if
it
--
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
that
is,
mr.
justice
black,
not
exactly,
i
take
the
position
that
congress
cannot
say
that
this
and
this
alone
is
sufficient
without
more
and
take
it
away
from
the
trial
judge.
they
seem
to
take
it
away
--
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
presence,
mere
presence.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
i
don't
–-
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
--
don't
think
so
–-
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
i
don't
think
so
in
this
mere
presence.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
making
mere
presence
a
crime.
that's
in
effect
of
what
it
amounts
to.
there
has
to
be
something
else
and
they
don't
need
the
presumption
to
get
it.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
i
think
we
need
a
practical
assumption
or
a
practical
inference
to
cover
the
usual
run
of
circumstances
rather
than
a
statutory
presumption
by
congress,
which
under
the
multitude
of
--
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
we're
just
saying
that
–
that
congress
whatever
their
motives
may
have
been
in
this
instance
just
cannot
do
this.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
yes
sir.[attempt
to
laughter]
granted
it
was
--
they
were
having
practical
difficulty
as
shown
in
the
legislative
history.
it's
cited
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below,
they
were
having
practical
difficulty
in
convicting
people
in
view
of
the
holding
of
this
court
in
bozza
making
these
various
crimes
and
that's
what
they
are,
if
your
honor
please,
crimes
and
a
crime
has
to
be
specific
and
a
man
has
got
to
go
in
before
12
men
--
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
apparently,
they
were
having
practical
difficulty
in
that
this
court
in
bozza
had
broken
down
the
various
categories.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
the
court's
--
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
the
fifth
–
the
fifth
circuit
apparently
and
as
well
as
other
circuits
since
bozza
have
–
was
--
broke
the
various
matters
down
into
separate
distinct
crimes
started
holding
as
a
head
in
the
past
that
mere
presence
in
these
situations
was
not
sufficient
to
sustain
a
conviction.
in
other
words,
the
fifth
circuit
has
consistently
held
that
mere
presence
without
law
is
insufficient
to
sustain
a
conviction
on
any
of
these
categories.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
just
the
fifth
circuit,
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
so
for
this
reason.
my
argument
a
few
moments
ago
attempted
to
relate
that
and
that
we
have
one
particular
violation
of
law
that
we're
dealing
with
and
that
is
possession
of
narcotics
and
the
possession
of
this
narcotic
is
a
physical
possession
where
you
have
control
over
it
or
dominion
or
exercise
in
some
manner
that
degree
of
supervision,
absent
ownership
or
immaterial
of
ownership,
that
is
a
type
of
possession,
it's
a
physical
possession.
here
sitting
at
a
place
or
being
present
at
a
place,
doesn't
have
that
requisite
degree
of
control
over
the
law,
just
mere
presence
that
we're
talking
about
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
i
believe
that
is
--
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
i
don't
think
the
proof
of
one
in
the
crime
could
be
paramount,
mr.
chief
justice,
so
have
we
--
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
of
course
they
have
--
you
will
know
the
nonpayment
--
the
tax
makes
it
the
crime
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
the
only
legal
distinction
i
could
see
and
would
be
prepared
to
comment
on
now
is
the
nature
of
the
possession
that
is
a
physical
possession
of
or
having
control
or
dominion
as
opposed
to
the
mere
presence
as
encompassing
possession.
i'm
not
prepared
to
argue,
may
it
please
the
court
on
[inaudible]
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
yes,
sir,
no
rational
connection.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
it's
quite
true,
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
received
on
–-
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
prior
after
some
[inaudible]
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
yes,
they
had
to
be
convicted
prior
to
that.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
that's
right
sir.
simply
that
i
could
be
there
for
any
number
of
reasons,
legal
or
illegal,
but
yet
i'm
--
that
mere
presence
under
this
statute
is
enough
and
it
makes
them
put
it
to
the
jury
and
jury
always
being
practical.
people
in
some
instance
is
when
a
case
of
this
type
comes
up
just
a
lot
of
--
a
lot
of
time
goes
along
and
certainly
would
be
--
saying
as
overcame
by
this
charge
that
this
is
sufficient
unless
this
man
gets
up
here
and
explains
it.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
yes,
sir.
and
it
says
that
the
judge
says,
well,
if
he
didn't
explain
it,
he's
guilty
of
it.
that's
what
we
say
is
the
trouble
in
the
situation
of
this
time.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
yes
sir.
i
frankly
think
that
you
did.
you
had
the
attempt
to
run
on
a
part
of
one
[inaudible]
and
another
self
is
insufficient.
you
had
the
admission
of
one
that
they
had
been
down
there
to
operate
it
and
you
might
infer
legitimately
that
they
had
some
knowledge
of
the
location
of
that
isolated
area.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
they
had
a
butane
gas
cylinder
on
the
truck.
they
didn't
have
a
chance
to
unload
it,
as
a
practical
matter
and
that's
the
reason
that
they
--
there
were
other
circumstances
as
the
court
found
sufficient
to
warn
or
--
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
no,
sir
because
we
are
dealing
with
mere
presence
as
an
overall
situation
involving
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
of
course,
i
will
have
to
view
it
more
closely
at
the
time
that
it
went
to
the
jury,
but
i
would
take
the
--
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
no,
sir,
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
as
a
matter
of
fact
one
respondent
in
this
case
did,
the
other
one
elected
to
serve
his
time
and
has
already
served
it
and
there's
a
–-
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
--
question
of
about
the
third
one,
[inaudible]
about
you
ascertain
it
before
him.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
the
jury
question?
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
i
think
the
judge
could
well
do
that,
the
trial
judge.
now
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
presence,
presence
[inaudible]
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
the
judge
would
have
to
dismiss
in
our
opinion,
but
the
statute
makes
him
to
put
it
to
a
jury
and
the
government
takes
the
position
that
precludes
the
judge
from
then
granting
of
verdict
of
acquittal
n.o.v.
and
that
is
a
serious
conflict
between
the
legal
aspects
of
a
set
of
facts
as
opposed
to
the
usual
solemnity
that
we
give
defining
of
a
jury.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
i
don't
--
it
may
--
it
may
--
i
don't
follow
the
reasoning
to
the
extent
that
it
deprives
him
of
the
right
to
writ
--
to
correct
the
apparent
error,
say
if
a
jury
did
just
go
contrary
to
--
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
i
should
--
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
i
suggest,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
if
they
did
decide
--
did
report
this
statute
out
with
that
finding
of
legislative
history
that
is
not
contained
in
it
as
i
know
it
and
as
i
have
been
able
to
find
it,
there
is
no
mention
about
human
experience.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
apparently,
they
realized
the
difficulty
in
these
situations
and
sought
to
approach
it
apparently
in
the
best
possible
way.
they
did
not
see
fit
to
redefine
the
crimes
nor
to
eliminate
any
of
the
crimes
and
make
one
big
consolidated
care
on
the
business
and
if
you're
there,
you
are
guilty.
they
maintained
the
crimes
as
they
were
and
has
been
interpreted
by
this
court,
and
narrowly
defining
the
various
stages
of
this
process
and
they
attempted
to
remit
of
the
impracticality
of
obtaining
convictions
by
the
inference
of
presumption.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
well,
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
human
experience
as
i
view
it
from
a
defendant
standpoint
of
the
theoretical
–-
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
i'll
say
this
[inaudible]
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
i
think
that
there
are
--
that
common
experience
would
show
that
in
a
goodly
number
of
situations
involving
the
so
called
illicit
operations,
there
are
those
who
go
and
pick
up
things
that
would
pick
up
the
finished
product
for
instance,
who
wouldn't
have
a
thing
in
a
world
to
do
about
letting
one
hand
to
work
there
or
to
set
it
up
or
to
be
considered
as
having
owned
it.
in
other
words,
they're
in
the
background.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
aiders
and
abettors
to
what?
that
is
our
question.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
probably
carrying
on
the
business?
that
is
a
question
that's
rather
close,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
as
to
whether
or
not
there
will
be
aiders
and
abettors
in
that
particular
transaction,
in
that
particular
operation
presumably
so
under
the
holdings
of
this
court.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
but
there's
another
statute
by
holding
raw
material
and
just
when
he
is
there,
are
we
going
to
say
he
holds
raw
material
or
that
he
aided
in
abetting
and
working
which
has
a
different
degree
of
punishment.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
no
sir.
i
don't,
i
think
the
government
points
that
up
in
their
brief,
but
there
is
not
--
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
no
sir.
and
again,
i
will
restate
the
respondent's
position
that
there
is
no
rational
connection
between
the
inference
as
to
these
10
or
11
different
situations.
we're
not
dealing
with
one
isolated
crime.
we're
dealing
with
a
series
of
circumstances
which
branches
out
into
several.
and
if
he
can
be
innocent
of
one
and
guilty
of
the
other
to
infer
that
mere
presence
go
this
way
as
opposed
to
that
way
is
a
strained
inference
indeed.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
about
the
evidence
on
the
--
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
i
think
so
because
--
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
traditionally,
questions
of
law
are
for
the
trial
judge
and
questions
of
facts
are
of
course
for
the
jury
and
if
the
fact
as
found
by
the
jury
do
not
constitute
a
crime
as
a
matter
of
law,
i
think
that
the
court
has
the
duty
and
the
power.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
he
might
be
well
doing
it,
mr.
justice
black,
but
i
think
--
i
think
that
judiciary
could
do
that.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
if
–
if
the
judiciary
could
not
do
that
not
at
the
trial
level
but
eventually
at
this
level,
then
this
court
would
be
powerless
to
hold
any.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
you
could
not
touch
any
statute
of
congress.
they
would
be
immune
from
review
or
interpretation
in
light
of
the
constitution.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
yes
sir.
and
he
could
have
done
it
at
trial
level.
mr.
joseph
h.
davis
that's
right.
that's
the
problem
here.
thank
you
sir.
