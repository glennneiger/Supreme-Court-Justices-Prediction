but
mr.
claiborne,
that's
the
truth
on
the
judge.
i
mean
it
was
–
it
makes
the
judge
[inaudible]
simple
case
of
the
jury
than
at
least
the
question
of
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
keeps
the
judgment
setting
his
verdict
aside.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
[inaudible]
but
legitimate.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
the
effects
were
just
limited
to
the
--
the
presumption
was
useful
or
made
useful
only
in
connection
with
one
item,
namely
operating
the
still.
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
you
still
make
the
same
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
if
he
knows,
he's
at
a
still.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
most
thing
right

the
still
and
what's
the
different
between

justice
byron
r.
white

but
that
was
only
on
possession
if
they
found?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
on
the
operation,
what
bozza
doesn't
help
you
with
this
–-
justice
byron
r.
white
what
kind
of
operation
they
solved?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
[inaudible]
of
presence
being
a
[inaudible]
that
the
operation
should
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
require
to
do
it
in
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
only
--
the
only
evidence
they
had
was
possession
in
the
fifth
circuit
--
justice
byron
r.
white
presence,
and
that's
all
they
had,
the
judge
would
have
to
dismiss
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
what
happened
in
tot,
the
court
disagreed
with
congress
is
the
one
that
met

it
was?
