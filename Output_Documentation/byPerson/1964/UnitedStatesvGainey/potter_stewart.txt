tot
and
these
other
decisions
that
you
just
submitted,
the
matter
of
reasonable
of
rationality
based
on
common
factual
experience
and
early
in
your
argument
mr.
justice
goldberg
asked
you
a
question,
which
i
think
you
didn't
answer,
because
i
think
you
weren't
given
an
opportunity
to
answer,
there's
another
question,
but
i'd
like
to
ask
you
again.
in
common
experience,
what
other
people
would
be
at
a
still
except
those
connected
with

operation
of

now,
i
grant
you,
i
can
understand
the
lost
aviator
who
is
parachuted
or
the

climber

the

and
there
are
such
cases
and
those
people
could
obviously
very
easily
explain
their
presence,

in
the
course
of
normal
human
experience,
what
other
people
would
be
at

still,
the
way
this

actually
works
in
real

connected

you
might
have
all
kinds
of
problems
under
this
legislation
with
respect
to
the
cases
like
lovander
and
ladner
or
whatever
it
was

barrel
against
the

but
those
problems
aren't
before
us
now,
that
is
the
duplicity

there
are
obviously
all
sorts
of
problems
like
that,

those

here
are
they?
