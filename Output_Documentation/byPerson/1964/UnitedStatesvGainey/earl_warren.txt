chief
justice
earl
warren
when
were
these
admissions
made
before
or
after
the
arrest
as
you're
saying?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well,
mr.
claiborne.
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
legal
distinction,
mr.
davis,
between
this
presumption
and
some
of
those
in
the
narcotic
laws?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
would
you
--
could
this
be
sustained
if
they
said
if
he
had
been
proved
to
commit
one
crime
that
you
could
presume
that
he
committed
another
in
connection
with
the
liquor
laws?
the
mere
fact
that
he
committed
one
crime
is
a
presumption
that
he
committed
another?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
that
be
different
from
the
one
you
have?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that's
–
that's
what
i'm
referring
to
in
the
narcotic
laws.
for
instance
if
they
found
him
in
possession,
the
law
says
that
that
possession
unexplained
is
proof
of
the
fact
that
the
tax
was
not
paid
on
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
another
the
crime
though,
and
may
sentence
him
consecutively
for
those
crimes.
i'm
just
–
i'm
not
asking
you
to
defend
that.
i
just
want
to
know
if
there's
a
legal
distinction
in
your
mind
between
the
two.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
ask
you
to
argue
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
the
same
time
for
the
others
