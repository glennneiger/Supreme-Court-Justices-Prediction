justice
hugo
l.
black
you
didn't
say
that
he
gave
another
option
and
if
you
may
go
ahead
and
treat
the
negro
register
the
same
way
in
the
previous
they
treated
the
white
ones
who
were
registered.
would
he
give
it
that
option
to
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course,
you
--
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
if
the
county
or
the
parish
of
this
fellow
where
they
have
zero
negro
voters
and
with
that
their
large
community.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
looking
at
one
natural—
justice
hugo
l.
black
westfield,
louisiana.
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
there
502
negros
in
that
area?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
not
registered.
justice
hugo
l.
black
both
in
56
and
60?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
east
carroll?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
been
any
registrar
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
300,
well
you
are
not
challenging
the
prime
that
this
has
been
used,
are
you,
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
negroes
to
vote?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
longer
problem
to
whom?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
--
are
they
satisfied
now
that
all
of
them
have
been
registered
--
that
they
have
been
registered?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
proposition
you're
arguing
relates
to
the
remedy.
why
do
you
recognized
of
course
that
courts
have
chances
as
time
in
memorial,
has
followed
some
practices
that
some
people
have
criticized
as
well.
i'm
going
to
step
that
about
the
chancery
court
in
the
early
part
of
this
country.
but
one
of
the
things
they
have
done
throughout
the
history
of
chancery
to
find
whether
there's
a
wrong
that
has
been
committed.
they
want
to
issue
an
order
to
prevent
it.
and
they
do
the
things
that
they
reach
the
common
sense
viewpoint
by
essentially
in
order
to
prevent
the
repetition
of
the
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
recognized
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
it
were
necessary
to
as
what
was
with
them
here,
if
that's
necessary
and
you
were
convinced
that
it's
necessary
the
lawyers
and
the
chancellor.
the
only
thing
to
do
is
if
you
can't
use
this
for
a
while
until
you
bring
about
somewhat
a
quality
but
you
say
the
chancellor
doesn't
have
the
right
to
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
these
circumstances.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
if
he
says
that
he
doesn't
have
the
power
to
do
it
in
some
circuit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
the
atkins
case.
i'm
talking
about
the
power
or
the
chancery
court
to
make
the
remedy
of
prescribe.
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
decree,
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
certainly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
hasn't
developed
yet
through
the
years,
has
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
been
100
years
almost.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
there's
no
good
at
it,
didn't
that
work?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
even
thought
about
it
but
they
couldn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
elected.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
more
and
they
haven't
accomplished
what
the
fifteenth
amendment
says
to
be
accomplished.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
but
you
would
--
you
would
agree,
wouldn't
you?
i'm
looking
at
the
statistics
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--of
what
happened
in
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
agree,
would
you
not,
that
just
on
its
face,
these
discrepancies
show
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
has
not
been
observed
in
that
state.
how
could
you
deny?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
true
with
reference
to
voting
in
many
places.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
that
since
19
--
we're
talking
about
the
year
of
1900
at
this
history
and
it
is
alleged
at
this
common
knowledge
that
the
obstacle
of
devoting
college
people
where
it
ranked
so
high,
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
individually
to
get
over
those
hurdles.
would
you
agree
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
new?
and
i
have
been
looking
for
here
and
i
haven't
found
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
law
--
does
the
law
forbid
the
registrars
at
ask
any
questions
except
those?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
can
ask
any
questions
they
desire
in
addition
to
those
in
determining
the
test,
can't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
law
prohibit
asking
into
more?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
can't
be?
of
course
it's
reasonably
known
a
common
knowledge
that
many
registrars
are
appointed
with
their
ability
to
ask
questions
that
cannot
be
answered.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
has
your
law
change?
why
has
your
law
said
they
cannot
continue
to
ask
that
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
leaves
it
up
to
that
as
a
question
the
law
does,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
registrars
are
selected
with
that
knowledge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
has
been
that
in
many
of
the
places
in
your
state
according
to
this.
many
of
the
places,
no
colored
person
have
been
able
to
register
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
all
the
white
people
have.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
maybe
some,
it's
not
a
token
thing
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
requires.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
with
--
but
within
the
registration
room,
so
far
as
the
law
requires,
these
registrars
who
have
been
there
before
and
still
there
can
ask
certain
questions
as
they
see
fit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
you
--
could
you
get
an
order
to
fill
what
has
happened
out
(inaudible)
as
matter
of
common
knowledge?
it's
certainly
a
matter
of
fictional
knowledge.
and
you
say
that
it
changes
and
they're
remarkable.
could
you
get
the
change
that
has
occurred
in
the
21
practices
--
the
21
parishes
and
send
it
to
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
if
it's
in
the
record,
in
fact
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
were
saying—
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
reason
i
ask
you
that
you
say
things
have
occurred
since
the
decree
which
should
make
a
difference.
of
course
that's
the
matter
that
could
more
properly
be
taken
out
from
the
lower
court.
but
since
you've
made
the
statement,
i
would
think
that
you
would
inform
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suggest
one
more
question.
you
are
complaining
about
the
order
for
reregistration,
general
reregistration,
aren't
you?
you
are
saying
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright,
suppose
it
does
have
the
right
to
do
it.
let's
assume
now
that
it
has
the
right
to
do
it.
chancellor
is
sitting
there
and
trying
to
get
some
way
to
see
that
you're
wrong
and
what
you
perpetuated
and
passed
will
not
be
continued.
would
you
think
that
is
an
unreasonable
position
to
take
that
you
should
order
complete
reregistration
so
that
the
whole
thing
can
be
looked
over?
assuming
they
have
power
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
agree.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
right
of
the
voters
to
vote.
justice
hugo
l.
black
will
not
allow
all
us
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
wouldn't
say
--
you
wouldn't
say
that
the
proportion
would
be
the
same,
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
an
adequate
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
how
many
are
registered
now
is
a
118,000?
justice
hugo
l.
black
out
of
118,000?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
111,000.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
those
registrations
required?
registrars
required
to
be
open
all
the
year
or
are
they
like
some
other
states
have
limited
time,
which
are
inadequate
to
bring
about
the
proper
registration.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
problem
there
as
you
see
is
not
an
inadequate
time
in
which
to
register.
but
the
fact
that
the
registration
takes
place,
people
who
use
their
powers
so
unfair
and
unjustly
that
the
negroes
are
denied
the
privilege
of
voting.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
under
whole
test,
i
think
with
reference
to
the
registrar's
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
did
you
say
is
his
own
judge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
is
the
appointed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
police
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
appoints
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
who?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
indication
in
the
record
or
has
louisiana
attempted
to
prove
by
any
of
these
officials
that
they
have
insisted
that
this
system
of
registration
be
carried
on
entirely
on
the
idea
of
registering
colored
people?
has
there
been
any
claim
on
that
part
that
they
have
done
that
of
a
public
measure?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
they
condone
it?
does
the
record
show?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
governor
the
head
of
the
board?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
has
been
the
position
of
the
governor
during
those
years
with
reference
to
allowing
colored
people
to
vote
on
his
public
statement
as
shown
by
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall
in
the
case
we
had
from
alabama
several
years
ago
where
the
case's
judgment
was
affirmed,
so-called
boswell
amendment.
the
record
was
still
and
the
evidence
showing
that
those
responsible
for
the
highest
administration
of
the
government
and
has
brought
on
enactment
of
the
--
submission
of
the
amendments,
that
frankly
and
openly
stated
that
the
purpose
was
to
keep
colored
people
from
voting.
do
you
have
anything
like
that
in
this
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
required
by
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
--
that
you
have
in
the
case,
that
you've
mentioned,
be
determined
whether
or
not
a
person
should
be
allowed
to
vote.
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
how
did
they
--
what
is
the
difference
there
with
reference
to
that
(voice
overlap)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
if
the
--
what
if
him
having
you
left
for
him
to
--
the
key
is
just
to
claim
and
the
voter
could
be
registered.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
only
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
--
so
far,
as
the
state
said
that
they
haven't
--
that
it
has
cured
all
these
things
and
can't
have
them
again,
and
that
is
one
of
the
arguments,
is
it
not,
on
which
they
have
to
say
to
you
that
they
want
this
injunction
manifested?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
have
written
any
white
people
alone
who
would
have
been
admitted
under
a
test
where
the
qualifications
are
much
less
than
those
they
would
impose
upon
them
by
the
new
test.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
therefore
that
would
deny
an
equal
protection
of
the
law
on
the
count
of
color.
