mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
after
listening
to
louisiana's
attorney
general
on
yesterday,
whose
argument
i
must
say
was
marked
by
commendable
frankness.
i
was
prepared
to
submit
my
case
with
a
very
few
words.
unfortunately,
i
had
a
full
evening
to
reconsider
and
doubtless
influenced
by
any
lawyers'
reluctance
to
be
cheated
out
of
this
argument,
i
found
there
is
yet
to
a
good
deal
to
be
said.
nevertheless,
i
hope
not
to
trespass
on
the
court's
time
and
not
to
use
my
full
allotted
time.
as
i
understood
louisiana's
argument
yesterday,
it
was
in
effect
this,
assuming
that
serious
discrimination
against
the
negro
in
his
exercise
of
the
franchise
had
been
perpetrated
in
the
past
under
the
rule
of
the
old
interpretation
test,
louisiana
says
that
is
behind
us.
louisiana
has
voluntarily
abandoned
that
old
discriminatory
device
and
has
now
enacted
a
brand
new,
uniform,
written,
objective
test
which
is
unexceptional.
as
to
the
past,
they
say,
let
us
forgive
and
forget
now
that
the
state
has
began
a
fresh
apparently
in
good
faith
using
a
model
suggested
by
the
department
of
justice
itself.
therefore,
there
is
no
occasion
even
to
outlaw
the
old
test.
it
has
been
abandoned
and
that
issue
is
moot
says
south
louisiana.
as
to
the
new
test,
neither
the
court
below
nor
the
government
has
challenged
its
constitutionality
in
this
proceeding.
accordingly,
says
the
state,
it's
improper
to
enjoin
its
use
and
especially
to
enjoin
its
use
only
in
21
parishes
thereby
creating
a
disparity
with
the
other
43
who
are
permitted
to
continue
using
it.
now,
there
is
a
--
the
suggestion
that
the
injunction
against
the
new
citizenship
test
might
be
appropriate
as
a
means
of
placing
the
negro
today
on
apparently
with
the
white
who
is
illegally
registered
in
former
times
by
saying
let
those
negroes
who
feel
that
they
were
discriminated
against
come
in
and
challenge
the
illegally
registered
white
voters.
in
louisiana,
we
have
a
very
convenient,
easy
challenge
procedure
and
they
may
simply
look
through
the
rolls
and
purge
the
white
voters
who
are
illegally
registered
without
taking
a
test
and
the
effects
of
that
past
discrimination
where
it
might
be
raised.
unfortunately,
it's
not
as
easy
as
all
that.
even
if
there
were
some
basis
who
believing
that
louisiana
has
turned
over
a
new
leaf
and
there
are
strong
indications
to
the
contrary
as
i
will
show.
the
decree
ended
below
in
every
respect
was
appropriate
and
necessary.
you
cannot
leave
the
interpretation
test
on
the
books,
not
in
louisiana.
the
requirement
that
applicants
be
able
to
understand
and
interpret
give
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
any
section
of
the
federal
or
state
constitution
when
read
to
him
by
the
registrar
is
still
part
of
the
law
of
louisiana.
it
is
still
enshrined
in
the
constitution
of
louisiana.
it
is
still
implemented
by
statutes.
when
the
new
test
was
enacted
in
1962,
the
old
was
not
repealed.
there
is
no
conceivable
room
for
argument
that
the
new
test,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
supplemented
the
old.
even
the
board
of
registration
whose
discretion
in
this
matter
may
be
questioned
has
not
explicitly
directed
registrars
to
stop
using
the
old
test
and
indeed,
as
was
mentioned
by
one
of
the
justices,
“yes
it
is.
the
record
shows
that
one
of
the
registrars
at
least
continued
to
use
the
old
test
after
the
board's
new
rules
and
new
test
have
been
promulgated.”
furthermore,
according
to
the
constitution,
the
old
test
is
not
optional,
it's
mandatory.
the
criminal
penalties
imposed
which
can
be
invoked
against
registrars
who
failed
to
apply
the
louisiana
laws.
the
attorney
general,
i
assume,
is
in
the
position
to
assure
the
court
that
no
such
prosecutions
would
be
instituted.
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
test
has
been
shelved.
for
three
decades,
it
was
shelved
after
it
was
first
passed.
it
was
revived
and
resurrected
when
the
need
arose.
that
may
well
happen
again.
louisiana
has
not
always
taken
the
same
position
with
respect
to
this
test.
for
a
long
time
it
was
apparently
viewed
as
purely
optional
up
to
any
registrar
to
use
it
as
it
saw
fit.
in
1956
through
1961,
louisiana
officials
or
some
of
them
at
the
highest
state
level
took
the
position
that
the
test
was
mandatory
and
that
any
registrar
who
declined
to
use
it
was
subject
to
removal
and
even
to
criminal
prosecution.
so,
louisiana
has
blown
hot
and
cold
on
this
issue
of
whether
the
test
is
in
fact
subject
to
being
shelved.
even
now,
it
is
possible
to
purge
a
voter
who
prior
to
1962
was
allegedly
registered
without
taking
the
test
on
the
ground
that
the
test
was
then
enforced
and
that
he
was
therefore
illegally
registered.
indeed
that
is
the
suggestion
made
for
negroes
as
to
whites
who
were
registered
without
taking
the
test.
in
short,
the
test
if
it
was
valid
has
the
continuing
effect
in
that
respect.
now,
under
existing
circumstances,
as
i
say,
there
can
be
no
assurance
with
the
test
will
not
be
revived
at
some
later
time
or
some
other
administration
in
some
parishes
if
not
at
all.
negroes
not
without
reason
will
continue
to
be
deterred
by
the
knowledge
that
this
so-called
weapon
of
discrimination
which
has
been
so
effectively
used
against
them
in
the
past
may
be
invoked
against
in
the
future.
they
are
entitled
to
have
the
registrars
stripped
of
this
weapon
altogether.
therefore,
the
general
injunction
issued
by
the
court
below
against
the
interpretation
test,
against
the
use
of
the
interpretation
test
throughout
louisiana,
which
incidentally
was
the
only
issue
appealed
in
the
notice
to
appeal
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
filed
in
this
court.
it
does
remain
the
central
issue
in
this
case.
there
is
of
course
another
reason
why
we
cannot
erase
the
interpretation
test
from
the
case
and
that
is
because
the
discrimination
it
accomplished
has
not
been
erased
in
fact
and
cannot
be
erased
without
further
relief,
which
is
justified
only
by
considering
the
effect
which
the
interpretation
test
had
during
its
stay.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
injunction
as
to
the
new
test,
yes.
they
would
be
because
there's
been
no
occasion
to
enjoin
the
old
test,
but
for
the
moment,
i'm
arguing
that
it
is
necessary
to
affirm
the
judgment
declaring
unconstitutional
and
permanently
enjoining
the
old
test.
i
will
primarily
deal
in
a
moment
with
the
new
test
and
the
necessity
for
enjoining
it
in
the
21
parishes
where
the
old
one
was
used
(voice
overlap).
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
statewide,
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
and
though
it
has
only
been
used
in
21
parishes,
it
is
available
in
all
64.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct
sir.
that
it
is
one
refined
and
to
which
is
--
that
it
is
enjoined
in
the
21
parishes
only
as
to
those
persons
who
are
eligible
to
vote
in
terms
of
age
and
residence
at
the
time
when
the
old
test
was
in
effect.
since
they
--
they
owe
in
the
sense
those
who
were
directly
discriminated
against
not
being
able
to
register
at
the
time
when
they
should
have
been
allowed
to
register.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is,
it's
a
suit
that
which
is
now
under
submission
to
a
registry
judge
statutory
court.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
brought
by
the
united
states.
inside
of
united
states,
this
is
board
of
registration
and
against
the
state
of
louisiana.
it
alleges,
despite
proof
has
been
submitted
that
the
application
form,
especially
the
new
application
form
of
which
there
are
now
five
variance
which
are
shuffled
lie
instructions
from
the
board
of
registration,
do
work
and
were
devised
to
work
as
a
further
substitute
instrument
to
discrimination
against
negroes,
and
that
negroes
especially
who
flunk
on
the
test
for
trivial
and
inconsequential
errors.
that
challenge
to
this
registration
form
or
application
form
is
not
limited
to
the
21
parishes
and
that
challenge
is
statewide.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
you
can
reg
--
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
clark.
that
is
the
minimum
requirement
that
it's
out
of
the
case
which
i
don't
want
to
get
into
too
far
here
shows
that
there's
not
such
a
minimum
throughout
certiorari.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
that
is
correct
that
it's
a
--
in
terms
of
the
good
faith
of
louisiana
and
its
determination
to
start
a
fresh
and
to
erase
the
effects
of
the
old
discrimination.
it
is
important
to
know
that
at
the
time
the
suit
was
filed,
11
of
the
21
parishes
involved
were
on
periodic
registration
which
means
that
they
would've
automatically
had
in
complete
new
registration
this
month,
this
year,
would
have
it
raise
the
effect
of
the
old
discrimination.
in
the
meantime,
however,
ten
of
those
11
parishes
all
but
one
had
to
switch
to
permanent
registration
and
thereby
had
sealed
in
rather
than
erased
the
old
discrimination,
and
this
was
purely
a
matter
of
choice
on
the
part
of
the
local
police
juries
who
helped
parishes
and
with
permission
from
the
central
state
board
which
as
i
understand
it
could
have
withheld
that
issue.
instead
of
moving
forward
toward
trying
to
erase
the
effect
of
the
old,
i'm
in
contrary
and
i
assume
deliberately
perpetuated
that
discrimination
by
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
as
to
those
who
were
--
flunked
on
the
interpretation
testing
properly,
they
are
free
to
reapply
and
they
are
not
submitted
to
the
citizenship
test
which
is
a
serious
hurdle.
they
--
they
do
suffer
the
burden
of
having
to
reapply
that
is
--
but
that
is
an
unfortunate
inevitable
burden
which
we
cannot
relieve
them
off.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
they
still
have
to
complete
the
application
form.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
which
we
do.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
and
we
can
only
do
one
thing
at
a
time
or
at
least
--
so
it's
not
--
filed
a
suit
and
as
the
court
noticed
in
the
mississippi
case
which
is
filed
subsequently
this
various
devices
were
challenged
together
rather
than
separately
and
perhaps
more
appropriately
challenged
together.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
according
to
the
reports
filed
in
the
record
of
this
case,
but
i
assume
in
the
hand
of
the
district
court
and
not
was
sent
here.
as
of
december
4
of
this
year,
these
reports
begin
in
march.
the
decree
was
actually
issued
in
january
but
the
summary
is
in
the
reporting
period
and
begins
in
--
until
march.
there
has
been
1899
negro
applicants
registered
and
1296
rejected,
which
is
purely
on
the
application
forms
since
that's
the
only
thing
in
effect.
by
contrast,
6046
white
applicants
had
been
accepted
in
those
21
parishes
whereas
243
only
had
been
rejected.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
its
negro
population
is
approximately
28%
of
the
whole.
the
actual
figures
are
shown
in
appendix
b
of
our
brief
which
is
the
very
last
pullout.
and
as
of
1960,
the
census
figure
for
the
21
parishes
shows
a
111,743
of
voting
age
as
compared
to
216,000
of
whites.
that's
34%.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
intended
to
submit
to
the
court
an
official
report
of
the
board
of
registration
for
the
period.
these
are
monthly
reports,
which
is
a
matter
apparently
were
sent
to
the
department
of
justice
by
the
louisiana
board
of
registration
and
which
i
assume
are
available
to
the
attorney
general
dated
november
30,
1964
and
while
i
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
totalize
the
figures
for
the
parishes
involved,
i've
marked
them
on
this
chart
in
red.
this
is
for
each
of
the
64
parishes,
not
only
the
21.
a
rough
look
at
it
would
indicate
that
the
registration
in
those
parishes
as
compared
to
1962
had
probably
doubled,
but
i'm
not
--
that
doubling,
however,
it
is
not
very
impressive
because
the
total
figure
in
december
1962
was
only
9000.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
111,000
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
perhaps,
well
--
and
then
where
the
population
is
increased
or
decreased
in
--
in
those
two
years.
i
assume
it's
roughly
to
say.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
--
i'm
not
absolutely
sure
mr.
justice
black.
my
impression
is
there
is
no
such
problem
that
the
registration
books
are
close,
i
believe,
30
days
before
any
election,
but
that
otherwise,
books
are
open
most
of
the
year
and
during
reasonable
hours
and
that
there
is
at
least
in
most
places
no
problem
of
getting
in
to
register.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
exactly
so
mr.
justice
black.
and
i
would
add
that,
they
do
not
do
so
individually
on
an
ad
hoc
basis.
i
think
this
is
a
fully
in
that
language.
the
state
itself
has
participated
by
enacting
statutes
which
is
designed
to
encourage
and
invite
the
registrars
toward
this
sort
of
discrimination
and
by
state
officials
who
have
pushed
individual
registrants
in
that
direction.
it
is
commendable
in
louisiana
that
43
parishes
despite
some
pressures
didn't
resist
and
did
not
so
far
as
this
record
shows
ever
used
the
interpretation
test.
but
it's
not
to
say
that
they
didn't
use
other
means
discriminatorily,
but
at
least
they
did
not
resort
to
the
interpretation
test.
as
far
the
21,
we're
mostly
concerned
with
in
this
case,
did
use
the
interpretation
test
which
we
say
is
plainly
no
more
than
a
device
to
make
racial
discrimination
easy
to
quote
the
court's
words
in
the
leser
case
or
cult
for
discrimination
as
the
court
said
in
granting
a
sentence.
now,
i
don't
want
to
pursue
the
condemnation
of
the
old
interpretation
test
in
light
of
the
fact
of
the
louisiana
attorney
general
did
not
defend
it
before
this
court.
it
is
however
important
to
show
the
effect
it
had
and
perhaps
mentioned
in
passing
some
of
its
most
obvious
flaws
for
that
dwelling
area.
the
first
point
i
would
emphasize
is
that
it
is
not
a
literacy
test.
in
no
sense,
it
is
a
literacy
test.
it
was
written
for
illiterates.
it
provides
that
the
section
of
the
constitution
shall
be
read
by
the
registrar
to
the
perspective
voter.
not
that
he
shall
read
it
nor
that
he
shall
write
his
answer.
it
was
intended
to
be
administered
wholly
and
orally.
they
ought
to
express
literacy
test
in
louisiana.
one
is
the
requirements
that
the
voter
be
able
to
read
and
write
any
section
of
the
preamble
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
a
relatively
simple
test
i
should
suppose
for
literacy
which
came
in
1960.
and
then
there
is
the
requirement
that
the
application
form
be
completed
by
the
applicant
in
writing
without
help
which
is
expressly
stated
to
be
a
literacy
test.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
at
times,
they
had
been
suggested
cards
furnish
upon
the
--
in
one
instance
by
the
white
citizens'
counsel
and
another
by
the
leander
perez,
the
district
attorney
of
plaquemines
parish
and
registrars
had
been
invited
to
use
those
cards
with
ready-made
questions
in
test
--
in
use
--
in
applying
the
interpretation
test.
in
most
parishes,
however,
the
test
was
conducted
without
any
cards
and
without
any
aids,
the
registrar
simply
took
the
book
of
the
louisiana
constitution,
it's
free
to
use.
the
federal
constitution
as
well
but
louisiana
constitution
has
then
600
pages
and
at
its
versatilities
therefore
considerably
greater
and
picked
out
any
section.
here,
the
registrar
chose
and
required
the
applicant
to
interpret
it.
sometimes
you
read
it
to
the
applicant
and
deny
the
applicant
the
advantage
of
at
least
seeing
the
text.
sometimes
they
show
him
the
book,
sometimes
they
gave
him
a
edification
and
sometimes
they
gave
him,
as
one
registrar
put
it,
a
long
drawn
out
twister
of
which
they
are
meant
in
louisiana
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
testimony
of
the
registrar
on
that
subject
is
somewhat
ambiguous.
some
of
them
conceded
that
they
had
consulted
a
local
judge,
consulted
an
attorney
in
the
building,
the
attorney
general
or
an
assistant
of
his
as
to
the
correct
answers
to
these
questions
indicating
that
they
are
not
so
sure
of
the
answers
themselves.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
they're
not.
i
think
it's
traditional
or
this
used
to
be
a
tradition
in
louisiana
that
registrars
are
somewhat
elderly
ladies,
widows
of
local
public
officials.
in
the
old
days,
it
was
a
more
of
i
suppose
a
--
the
special
talents
required
were
not
extraordinary.
i
think
i
can
rely
without
going
any
further
as
to
the
preposterous
character
of
the
interpretation
test
in
louisiana
on
its
own
former
colorful
governor,
earl
long.
in
1960,
when
he
was
addressing
the
louisiana
legislature
and
looking
at
them,
he
said
this,
referring
to
the
interpretation
test,
“you
got
to
interpret
the
constitution.
there
ain't
ten
people
looking
at
me
including
myself
who
if
properly
approached
or
attacked
could
probably
qualify
to
vote.”
and
he
knew
whereof
his
vote.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
test
was
never
meant
to
be
taken
seriously
at
least
as
far
as
whites
were
concerned.
it
was
to
be
invoked
sometimes
in
some
places
as
to
some
people.
all
that
was
known
and
has
been
known
and
was
foretold
as
early
as
1898
when
the
louisiana
constitutional
convention
rejected
this
proposal,
which
was
then
invoked
in
mississippi
and
south
carolina
on
the
ground
that
it
was
so
plainly
fraudulent
and
lacking
in
forthrightness
that
it
could
not
be
accepted
as
a
voting
requirement
in
louisiana.
i
don't
want
to
lead
you
to
think
that
the
delegates
of
louisiana
convention
of
1898
deserve
too
much
commendation.
they
are
ones
who
invented
the
‘grandfather
clause'.
instead,
it
was
more
forthright,
i
suppose.
but
that's
all
that
can
be
said
though.
now,
in
practice
as
they
say
the
louisiana
test
has
been
used
as
an
optional
device.
it
--
i
need
not
dwell
on
its
elastic
qualities,
and
its
subjective
flaws.
it's
entirely
up
to
the
registrar
what
section
to
select.
he
may
or
he
may
give
help
or
withhold
him.
nothing
in
the
statutes
governs
these
questions.
and
most
important,
he
is
the
sole
judge
when
it
comes
to
grading
and
since
the
only
standard
in
the
law
is
whether
the
interpretation
given
by
the
applicant
is
reasonable,
the
room
for
discrimination
is
obvious.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
registrar.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
he
is
appointed
by
the
local
police
jury,
and
then
i
believe
the
(voice
overlap)
so.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
police
jury
is
the
governing
body
of
--
of
a
parish
county
in
louisiana.
he
is
however
subject
to
removal
by
the
central
state
board
of
registration.
at
will.
the
statute
said
that
will.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
made
up
as
a
matter
of
perhaps
in
the
constitution,
of
the
governor,
the
speaker
of
the
house,
and
the
lieutenant
governor.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
lieutenant
governor,
the
three
highest
state
public
officials.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
black,
they
said
they
don't
concede
the
contrary
but
i
don't
think
it
is
accurate
to
say
that
louisiana
--
that
louisiana
board
has
attempted
to
exonerate
itself
from
the
acts
perpetuated
for
the
registrars.
and
they
themselves,
the
board
have
condoned
this
on
a
gain,
off
a
gain
system
of
using
the
test.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
first
of
all,
for
three
decades
they
did
not
even
suggest
to
the
registrars
that
they
do
use
it.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
suppose
he's
the
chairman
of
the
board.
i
don't
think
he
has
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
don't
believe
--
i
think
it
depends
which
governor.
during
the
fathers'
time
earl
long
was
governor.
he's
used
for
quite
decision.
but
those
of
the
intervening
governor,
governor
davis
and
the
present
governor,
governor
mckeithen.
but
i
don't
think
the
record
reflects
any
public
statements
by
the
governor
as
such.
the
only
documents
in
the
record
are
resolutions,
letters,
instructions
from
the
board
as
a
whole
usually
signed
by
the
director
of
the
board
who
is
also
a
defendant
here,
mr.
contraire
and
these
are
ambiguous
and
contradictory.
in
some
instances,
registrars
are
told
that
they
must
use
the
test.
in
other
instances
as
now
that
in
effect
told
that
they
did
not
use
the
test,
and
must
not
use
the
test.
the
board
has
circulated
from
its
offices
pamphlets
prepared
by
the
officials
of
the
white
citizens
counsel
explaining
the
importance
of
resorting
to
purges
and
to
urge
the
black
voter,
the
black
voter
who
had
been
registered
by
the
naacp
and
the
communists.
the
message
was
very
clear,
i
think.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
--
this
record
is
not
as
full
of
open
and
frank
admissions
by
louisiana
officials
as
to
that
purpose.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
did
not
understand
it
to
be
conceded
that
it
needs
to
be
enjoined.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
--
i
think
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
then
i
will
move
on
to
the
other
question,
the
appropriateness
of
the
relief
against
the
citizenship
test.
but
i
must
say
before
going
there,
that
the
effect
of
this
old
discrimination
under
the
old
test
is
the
key
to
the
injunction
against
the
citizenship
test.
that
it
is
with
that
in
mind
primarily
that
i'd
dwell
on.
i
don't
want
to
get
into
the
statistics
and
little
maps
i
had
for
the
court
except
to
point
out
that
those
statistics
in
appendix
b
of
21
parishes
show
that
80
and
90%
of
the
white
voting
age
residents
were
registered
in
those
parishes.
obviously,
without
being
submitted
to
any
serious
test
under
the
interpretation
clause,
whereas
the
negroes
in
those
same
parishes
who
were
subjected
to
the
test
have
registration
rates
from
below
1%
to
a
maximum
of
20%.
and
this
cannot
be
attributed
to
any
accident
or
to
any
claim
that
it
was
a
general
upgrading
of
registration
standards.
it
is
--
the
figures
simply
cannot
bear
out
the
claim
that
so
many
negroes
are
incapable
of
passing
the
test,
and
yet
almost
all
whites
are
capable
of
passing
the
test.
nor
is
much
to
be
attributed
to
the
so-called
negro
apathy
in
these
parishes.
and
that
is
illustrated
by
comparing
the
parishes
that
use
the
test
and
their
neighboring
parishes
which
do
not.
for
instance
in
--
on
this
little
map,
de
soto
parish
in
the
left
hand
side
of
the
map
had
a
registration
rate
of
9%,
whereas
sabine
parish
right
below
it,
this
is
negro
registration
rate.
9%
of
the
eligible
the
voting
age
negroes
were
registered
in
de
soto,
whereas
right
next
to
it
in
sabine
more
than
75%
of
the
voting
age
negroes
who
registered.
the
same
comparison
can
be
made
for
allen
and
evangeline
parish
with
rapides.
in
allen
in
evangeline,
90%
of
the
voting
age
negroes
are
registered
to
vote
or
were
registered
in
1962.
these
figures
are
relevant.
whereas
in
rapides,
right
next
to
it,
only
17%.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
as
a
historical
and
sociological
matter,
it
is
generate
through
in
louisiana
with
the
northern
part
of
the
state,
which
is
mostly
that
part
colored
in
red
on
these
maps,
and
the
so-called
florida
parishes,
which
is
slightly
below
are
known
as
the
areas
that
are
abiding
race
prejudice
whereas
southwest
in
southern,
louisiana
which
are
french
in
origin
to
those
part.
i
don't
claiming
all
the
credit
for
the
french
but
that
they
are
for
the
most
part
caucasian
origin,
do
not
discriminate
in
this
respect.
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
in
all
the
areas,
they're
not
giving
some
discrimination.
but
as
to
voting,
judging
from
90%
negro
registration
it
is
they
do
not
and
have
not.
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
it
does
have
some
relation.
the
correlation
is
not
perfect
because
they
are
a
great
many
southern
parishes
where
the
negro
populations
have
in
yet
--
the
test
did
not
use.
but
the
negro
population
is
also
quite
dense.
it
so
happens
that
that's
significantly
so
in
those
parishes
where
the
test
was
in
though?
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
beg
to
say
that
the
claiborne
parish
is
one
of
the
worst.
it
is
named
after
my
great,
great
grandfather
who
was
the
first
governor
of
louisiana.
now,
the
--
i
can't
emphasize
too
much
the
deterrent
effect
of
this
interpretation
test.
in
the
negro
community,
it
became
known
that
a
school
teacher
had
flunked
the
test.
a
foreign
negro
sharecropper
was
not
going
to
then
subject
himself
to
the
embarrassment
and
humiliation
of
taking
the
test.
that
was
repeated
over
and
over
again.
therefore,
one
cannot
rely
on
rejection
figures,
on
how
many
applied
and
were
rejected.
most
were
simply
deterred
from
ever
applying.
and
that
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
why
it
is
impossible
and
impractical
to
now
talk
about
measuring
those
who
discriminated
against
as
opposed
to
those
for
whom
the
test
--
those
whites
with
whom
the
test
was
dispensed
with.
there
are
of
course
no
records
to
those
who
were
simply
deterred.
in
fact,
there
are
very
few
records
for
those
who
were
rejected.
this
test
was
given
orally,
and
no
record
was
kept
when
a
rejection
was
made.
for
that
matter,
no
record
was
actually
kept
when
--
have
kept
of
what
had
been
done
with
respect
to
the
interpretation
test
when
the
applicant
passed.
it's
therefore
impossible
to
add
names
of
negroes
who
were
discriminated
against,
or
to
subtract
names
of
whites
for
whom
the
test
was
waived.
the
remedy
suggested
here
that
the
negroes
go
in
and
challenged
the
whites
who
are
illegally
registered.
it's
preposterous.
as
the
practical
matter,
there's
no
way
of
discovering
them
one-by-one.
the
burden
of
doing
so
is
absolutely
beyond
the
reach
of
those
whom
it
is
suggested
do
the
work.
beyond
that,
if
the
test
really
is
optional
as
louisiana
attorney
general
says
no
one
was
illegally
registered
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
there
was
a
discrimination
under
the
fifteenth
amendment,
but
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
it
cannot
be
said
that
anyone
should
be
purged.
and
therefore,
there
is
clearly
no
adequate
remedy
at
law
even
if
in
different
circumstances
there
were
an
inclination
to
relegate
these
people
to
a
state
remedy
which
of
course
is
not
required.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
know
that
louisiana
would
uphold
the
challenge
based
on
a
fifteenth
amendment
discrimination
as
opposed
to
a
violation
of
the
state
law.
that
case
would
have
to
be
taken
to
this
court
before
the
challenge
was
sustained.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
with
one
ex
--
perhaps
more
than
one
exception
but
there
is
one
exception
for
orleans
parish,
this
new
orleans
who
had
--
i
believe
supported
by
the
governor.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no
sir.
he
is
a
different
official.
and
i
say
he,
it's
usually
she,
that's
the
tradition
in
louisiana.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
is
removable
at
will
in
sense
by
the
state
board
of
registration,
and
cannot
then
be
reappointed
by
the
police
jury.
that
question
was
ruled
on.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
--
i'm
really
not
sure
as
to
the
orleans
parish
registrar.
now,
and
finally
getting
to
this
citizenship
test,
it
may
well
be
that
this
test
is
easier
than
the
old
test
strictly
enforced.
that
does
not
matter
to
our
argument.
we
do
not
challenge
the
new
test
here
in
this
proceeding.
it
is
uniform.
it
is
objective.
it
is
written.
the
questions
are
limited,
and
i
think
i
should
say
mr.
justice
black
that
you
perhaps
under
misapprehension
yesterday
as
to
the
registrars
in
inventing
new
questions
to
post
to
the
applicant.
under
the
law,
you
cannot
do
that.
you
must
stick
to
the
cards,
and
there
are
ten
cards
that
they
are
set
out
before
the
applicant's
and
he
must
pick
one.
the
questions
are
printed
there,
and
there's
an
answer
for,
and
it's
all
done
relatively
mechanically.
i'm
not
saying
that
there's
not
room
for
discrimination
even
there,
but
it
is
not
in
this
form
of
adding
new
difficult
questions.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
the
--
the
constitution
and
below
expressly
required
that
the
test
be
uniform,
which
i
assume
means
the
same
procedures
and
even
the
same
questions
must
be
applied
throughout
the
stage.
that
it'd
be
wholly
in
writing,
and
that
it'd
be
objective.
and
i
assume
as
a
practical
matter
that
means
question
and
answer,
which
is
the
way
it's
--
i
mean
multiple
choice
answer
a,
b,
c.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
in
each
parish,
there's
one
with
--
one
or
more
deputies.
in
orleans
parish
many
deputies,
in
others
only
one
deputy.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
was
true
under
the
old
test.
it
is
not
true
on
the
new
test.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
new
test
being
printed
on
the
card
or
on
ten
cards,
the
applicant
having
the
choice
of
selecting
the
card
without
seeing
the
face
of
it.
the
registrar
has
no
discretion
as
to
which
card
to
give
or
which
question
to
give,
the
first
difference.
secondly,
the
answer
is
marked
a,
b,
and
c.
it's
multiple
choice,
so
the
registrar
has
no
discretion
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
answer.
if
the
right
answer
was
b
and
the
applicant
put
a,
he
fail.
but
if
he
put
a,
he
pass.
there's
no
discretion
in
the
registrar
in
that
respect.
assuming
he
grades
the
card
correctly,
mechanically
correctly.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
there
is
always
the
possibility
of
helping
the
white
registrant
with
the
answers.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
the
--
i
don't
want
to
go
too
far
a
field
and
suggest
the
practices
which
may
be
invoked
in
which
--
i
don't
know
enough
about
and
that
there
hasn't
been
enough
experience
under
this
too.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
no,
he
does
not.
however,
the
answer
card
is
filed
and
is
required
as
a
matter
of
state
law
to
be
made
a
part
of
the
registrar's
records
so
that
it
is
--
it
can
be
reviewed,
that
is
the
third
difference.
it
is
wholly
written
and
the
record
is
kept.
that
was
not
true
of
an
oral
interpretation.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
anyone
--
anyone
is
entitled
to
go
here
and
see
the
records.
including
the
applicant
himself.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
i
--
i
think
he
has
to
go
to
court
about
it
but
i
think
he
can
go
in,
not
then
he's
not
told
how
he
flunked
and
why
he
flunked.
a
matter
of
fact,
as
i
understand
it,
he's
given
the
citizenship
test
and
then
he
is
given
the
application
form,
or
one
before
the
other.
but
in
any
event
he's
required
to
complete
both.
if
he
makes
the
mistake
on
either,
he
simply
told
he's
failed,
he's
not
told
whether
he
has
made
an
error
in
the
application
form,
whether
he
made
an
error
in
the
test.
and
he
goes
away
below
than
pass,
but
he
presumably
can
come
back
later
on,
look
at
his
card
once
it's
in
the
file
and
if
it
appears
that
all
right
answer
are
on
it,
go
to
the
court
about
it.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly,
justice
harlan.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
black.
and
to
that
extent,
it
is
relevant
--
i
should
say
whether
discrimination
is
somehow
still
being
perpetuated
--
new
discrimination
is
being
perpetrated
under
the
new
regime.
and
that
is
basically
the
burden
of
the
other
suit
although
with
reference
to
the
application
form
rather
than
the
citizenship
test.
but,
i
don't
want
to
imply
that
the
government
views
the
citizenship
test
as
a
--
without
fault.
it
is
simply
not
an
issue
in
this
proceeding
and
was
not
invalidated
in
the
lower
court
and
we
are
not
here
challenging
it.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
that
is
true
sir,
but
there
had
been
very
little
time.
in
any
event
the
new
system
was
inaugurated
in
august
of
1952.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
in
fact
i
would
say
that
lower
court
invited
the
several
parishes
involved
to
wipe
away
on
their
own
the
effect
of
past
discrimination
by
reregistering
or
by
allowing
the
normal
periodic
reregistration
to
take
place
as
i've
say
it
would
have
this
month
in
most
of
those
parishes.
the
court
did
not
order
them
to
reregister,
i
assume
because
it
had
some
reservations
about
its
power
to
do
that.
but,
it
said
until
you
do
on
your
own
race
the
effects
of
this
old
discrimination,
you
cannot
establish
a
new
hurdle
which
however
nondiscriminatory
it
may
be
and
however
admissible
it
may
be
up
on
its
face,
here,
acts
as
an
agent
to
perpetuate
the
old
discrimination
in
the
sense
that
it
seals
it
in
because
the
distinction
is
not
between
the
old
test
and
the
new
test.
the
distinction
is
between
the
white
registrant
who
took
no
test
as
the
negro,
for
the
most
part
goes
we're
now
applying
on
negroes,
who
is
not
subjective
to
a
however
modest
test,
a
hurdle.
and
clearly
some
test
is
more
of
a
burden
than
no
test.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
exactly
so
mr.
justice
goldberg.
now,
let
me
say
on
--
on
the
point
that
there's
some
discrimination
that
results
because
this
test
has
only
enjoined
in
21
parishes
whereas
in
the
43
remaining
parishes,
it
is
permitted
to
go
on.
first
answer
is
of
course
that
a
court
in
this
case
was
only
concerned
with
one
type
of
discrimination
--
discrimination
that
had
been
perpetuated
under
the
interpretation
test
and
it
could
reach
no
further.
in
other
proceedings,
it
maybe
appropriate
to
remove
the
hurdle
if
it
is
found
that
its
effect
is
to
perpetuate
past
discrimination
accomplished
by
different
means.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
any
substantial
new
test
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well
mr.
justice
white
not
as
to
a
literacy
test
because
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
it
isn't.
louisiana
has
two
literacy
tests.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
think
it
is
relevant
how
simple
it
is.
the
extent
to
which
it
is
a
real
hurdled
registration.
now,
i
assume
that
any
test
device
is
--
is
devised
without
any
discriminatory
intent,
racial
discriminatory
intent
because
some
people
won't
pass
it.
there's
not
much
point
in
a
test
where
everyone
is
going
to
pass.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
because
they
--
they
had
had
to
be
able
to
read
the
preamble
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
i
don't
see
it
in
unless
that
your
three
sentences
were
taken
out
of
the
louisiana
constitution
or
some
very
difficult
tests.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
only
to
the
extent
of
finding
it
to
be
a
substantial
hurdle
to
registration,
but
as
your
honor
says,
we
would
take
the
same
position
with
respect
to
any
other
substantial
new
requirement
that
are
not
been
formally
imposed
on
white
applicants.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no.
i
should
say
that
the
brief
for
louisiana
does
not
give
a
fair
representation
of
the
citizenship
test
by
suggesting
that
a
typical
question
is
who
was
the
first
president
of
the
united
states.
i
--
the
questions
are
in
the
record
from
pages
235
to
244,
but
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that's
all
ten
cards
with
43
questions
juggled
a
bit.
at
the
end
of
that
citation,
the
answer
card
shows
all
43
questions
in
a
more
convenient
form,
really.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
244.
and
i
believe
the
answer
card
which
lists
all
the
questions
seriatim,
is
on
246.
now,
i
just
take
one
or
two
of
them
to
show
that
they're
not
quite
that
easy.
for
instance,
i'm
very
confident
that
every
louisianan
does
not
know
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
must
be
35
years
or
older
than
30,
or
more
relevantly
perhaps
that
the
laws
of
the
district
of
columbia
are
passed
by
the
congress
and
not
by
the
people
who
live
there
as
one
might
suppose,
that
it
is
the
chief
justice
rather
than
the
speaker
or
the
vice-president
who
presides
with
the
impeachment
trial
of
the
president.
and
then
there's
some
questions
that
in
the
louisiana
context
might
give
pause
such
as
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
places
the
final
authority
in
our
nation
in
the
hands
of,
a)
the
national
courts,
b)
the
states
or
c)
the
people.
to
all
the
talk
in
louisiana
that
state's
right
on
the
one
hand,
and
about
how
this
court
remakes
the
constitution
on
the
other
hand,
the
people
get
varying.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
true
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
true.
that's
true.
now,
i
should
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
let
--
let
me
correct
myself
to
this
extent
mr.
justice
white.
the
injunction
is
not
perpetual
and
it
odes
not
apply
to
new
voters
who
just
come
of
age.
therefore,
as
to
the
younger
generation,
the
test
can
be
applied
even
in
its
21
parishes.
it's
only
those
who
should
have
been
registered
long
ago,
who
are
now
being
committed
to
register
under
the
old
standards.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
yes.
i
just
want
to
make
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
true
but
that
is
not
a
--
an
impossible
solution.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
on
the
contrary,
it's
an
easy
remedy
for
the
state.
it's
one
that
you
would
have
occurred
in
the
normal
course
of
time
and
one
which
louisiana
has
deliberately
withdrawn
at
the
moment
when
it
was
about
to
solve
the
problem
of
past
discrimination.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
with
--
they're
all
--
a
substantial
number
of
negroes
who
should
--
who
of
age
to
have
been
registered
at
a
time
when
whites
were
registered
without
passing
any
test.
the
negroes
should
be
placed
on
a
parity
with
them
and
given
the
same
opportunity
to
register
without
taking
this
new
hurdle.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that's
true.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
right.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
to
that
extent
again,
it
is
relevant
that
this
test
is
not
merely
pro
forma
that
it
is
in
fact
difficult
enough,
that
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
a
great
number,
no
majority
but
a
great
number
of
those
whites
who
are
now
registered
could
not
have
passed
it,
if
they've
been
subjected
to
it.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
only
fair
way
to
find
out
is
to
give
it
to
them.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
right.
but
i
emphasized
when
we
are
talking
about
parishes
where
not
and
typically
90%
of
the
white
population
is
registered
and
1%
of
the
negro
population
of
voting
age
is
registered.
that's
the
context
in
which
we're
speaking
of
the
whites
who
took
no
test
to
the
negroes
who
are
now
subjected
to
a
substantial
burden
in
registration.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly,
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
all
that
is
required
here
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
very
correctly
sir.
and
this
discrimination
is
quite
different
from
the
supposed
disparity
between
the
21
and
the
43
parishes.
that's
a
disparity
between
the
young
and
the
old
basically.
and
it
is
not
impossible
to
justify
setting
a
new
standard
not
on
racial
grounds,
which
has
no
racial
effect
to
fold
a
new
generation
who,
after
all,
may
well
have
additional
educational
advantages
and
be
more
able
to
meet
a
new
higher
test.
we
do
not
say
that
the
state
can,
in
no
time,
raise
its
registration
standards.
we
say
that,
it
cannot
do
so
when
the
effect
of
that
is
to
seal
in
this
old
discrimination
and
give
a
lifetime
voting
license
under
louisiana's
permanent
registration
system
to
whites
who
couldn't
pass
the
new
standards.
we
submit
that
the
judgment
in
all
respects
should
be
affirmed.
