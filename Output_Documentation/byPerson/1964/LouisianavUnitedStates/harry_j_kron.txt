mr.
harry
j.
kron
mr.
chief
justice,
i
understand
now,
i
have
only
seven
minutes
left
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
it
for
my
final
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron
may
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron
it's
obvious
that
in
only
seven
minutes,
i'm
not
going
to
be
able
to
completely
cover
the
able
and
thorough
presentation
made
by
solicitor
general's
office.
i
do
want
to
cover
just
a
few
high
points.one,
with
respect
to
justice
stewart's
statement
of
our
conceding
something,
i
will
explain
that
but
wait
for
him
to
return
to
the
bench.
and
secondly,
a
very
important
thing,
a
very
important
consideration
that
was
brought
into
these
discussions
by
justice
white,
it
is
apparent
from
the
government's
argument
that
they
have
set
as
justice
black
just
mentioned
a
moment
ago
the
idea
and
the
image
that
with
this
90%
of
registered
white
people
and
only
a
very
small
percentage
of
negroes,
that
that
is
a
permanent
thing
because
of
the
system
of
permanent
registration.
that
is
not
so.
it
is
apparent
and
i
think
that
we
can
take
notice
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
tremendous
removal
and
transfer
and
moving
around
of
our
population
during
these
days.
and,
although
we,
as
defendants,
appellants
here
had
not
at
the
time
because
it
didn't
--
didn't
at
that
stage
of
the
thing
seemed
particularly
appropriate.
there
is
enough
documentary
evidence
in
this
record
to
show
the
total
population
and
registration,
not
the
population,
the
registration
figures
in
the
parish
of
orleans
for
instance
over
a
period
of
some
eight
or
ten
years.
now,
if
you
--
if
this
court
will
start
in
that,
you
will
notice
that
although
those
percentages
that
the
government
presents
to
you
and
then
leaves
the
image
that
this
is
a
permanent
and
unchangeable
thing,
that
in
those
eight
or
ten
years,
the
registration
totals
in
city
of
new
orleans,
which
is
also
synonymous
with
the
parish
of
orleans,
is
down
10,000
registered
voters
approximately
and
that
during
that
same
period,
there
has
been
an
increase
in
the
registration
of
the
negro
registered
voters.
they're
--
under
the
provisions
of
louisiana
law,
there
are
automatic,
systematic
statutory
requirements
that
at
the
end
of
each
four-year
period
there'd
be
under
this
permanent
registration
removals
made
from
the
rules
as
a
result
of
death
removals,
moving
out
of
the
parishes,
notices
from
other
registrars,
that
a
person
has
moved
to
that
parish
and
he's
eliminated
from
the
rule.
and,
necessarily
it
is
true
as
a
matter
of
mathematics
in
that
instance,
that
when
a
person
does
remove
from
orleans
parish
to
one
of
the
others
and
registrars
had
notices
sent,
this
white
person
has
taken
off
and
the
result
from
the
90%
that
are
registered,
you're
going
to
have
more
white
people
being
taken
off
from
day
to
day,
it's
--
it's
inevitable,
than
there
would
be
negroes
who
moved
around.
those
percentages
are
going
to
happen.
the
result
is,
and
i
repeat,
that
a
study
of
the
statistics
filed
in
this
record
from
using
orleans
as
one
of
the
examples
because
it
has
the
biggest
population
parish
of
the
state
will
show
that
over
this
period,
there
are
10,000
less
registered
voters
in
orleans
parish
today
than
there
was
a
year
or
ten
years
ago.
it
is
less
white
persons
registered
and
more
negroes
were
despite
this
reduction.
that
is
a
fact
shown
in
this
record.
mr.
harry
j.
kron
i
just
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
don't
think
i'm
qualified.
now,
then,
with
the
question
of
justice
white's
approach
to
this
regardless
of
what
new
test,
louisiana
would
perpetuate
or
put
forth,
yes,
i
think
the
government
would
object
to
that
and
they
are
so
doing
without
going
beyond
this
record
in
the
attack
on
our
louisiana
registration.
mr.
harry
j.
kron
justice
white,
i'm
going
to
say
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron
i'm
going
to
say
that
we
have
never
opposed
the
right
of
this
court
under
the
--
under
the
equity
provision,
under
the
chancery
jurisdiction
to
--
and
the
alabama
case
is
the
authority
for
that
to
--
to
provide
some
remedy
either
the
elimination
or
the
correction
of
past
inequities
and
the
past
discriminatory
practices.
but
by
the
same
token,
even
though
those
things
have
taken
place
and
we
agree,
i
am
arguing
here
that
this
court
or
any
court
of
equity,
in
that
respect,
can
in
so
doing,
not
strike
down
a
state
law
that
is
entirely
valid
and
it
is
agreed
by
everyone
here
to
be
valid,
to
--
to
prescribe
minimum
qualifications
and
standards
and
i
would
like
to
--
to
illustrate
that
point.
the
state,
without
question,
has
a
right
to
test
through
the
appointment
of
board
examinations
or
dental
examinations
to
test
the
qualifications
of
the
professions
and
the
trades
and
what
not.
and,
they
have
from
time
to
time
change
those
provision,
and
that
has
not
been
held
anywhere
or
even
attacked
to
have
been
a
discriminatory
thing
against
those
who
are
already
practicing,
who
are
already
--
who
are
licensed
in
that
field.
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
that
the
state
from
time
to
time
so
long
as
that
is
absent
a
discriminatory
intent
in
an
application,
the
right
to
change
the
rules
of
the
game.
mr.
harry
j.
kron
in
the
43
parishes
where
the
citizenship
test
is
now
being
given,
justice
white.
it
has
been
conceded
by
the
government
that
prior
that
that
never--
never
has
the
verbal
interpretation
of
that
test
been
given.
now
then,
there
are
many
people
presently
on
the
rule.
mr.
harry
j.
kron
not
necessarily
because
i
--
from
my
own
experience,
i
know
that
during
the
war
years,
for
instance,
and
many
of
the
states
in
this
country
who
just
suspended
the
necessity
for
taking
bar
examinations
to
any
--
any
lawyer
applicant
to
the
bar
who
--
who
is
in
the
military
service
during
that
time.
so,
they
had
to
take
none
at
all.
so,
i
--
i
think
that
the
illustration
i'm
making
is
not.
however,
going
to
the
--
to
the
question
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron
however,
in
these
instances
we
have
--
we
have
many,
many
people
now
who
have
a
new
standard
and
additional
requirement
in
those
43
parishes
who
have
that
--
had
no
such
requirement
for
it.
my
time
is
running
out
and
i
would
like
to
say
to
justice
stewart
that
we
--
and
i'm
sorry
if
i
misled
you.
we
have
not
conceded
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute.
i
simply
said
yesterday
that
we
assumed
for
the
sake
of
argument.
i
think
our
briefing
in
this
case
will
show
that
we're
coming
here
with
honesty
of
purpose
and
clean
hands.
and
we
--
it's
not
saying
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
per
se
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron
we
are
saying
that
there
is
evidence
in
this
record
to
show
that
there
were
instances
of
discriminatory
practices.
and
to
that
extent,
this
court
then
would
have
the
right
to
correct
and
to
--
and
to
prohibit
any
further
continuation
of
those.
and
we
are
strongly
urging
this
court
to
consider
that
under
the
long
line
of
cases
and
the
women
suffrage
is
the
greatest
example.
i
know
of
the
fact
that
after
the
happersett
case
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
congress
of
this
united
states
to
pass
a
constitutional
amendment
to
permit
women,
who
we
all
agree
and
must've
did
and
wouldn't
do
otherwise
always
have
had,
intellectual
and
educational
qualification
is
necessary
to
cast
an
intelligent
and
a
valid
vote
but
who
are
prohibited
to
do
so
by
the
very
limitations
that
we're
talking
about
before
this
court.
we
think
the
state
has
the
right
to
make
certain
limitations
so
long
as
they
are
not
in
conflict
with
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
of
our
law.
i
think
--
there
are
many
other
things
but
i
think
that
we're
getting
into
areas
that
all
of
us
understand
and
i
think
that
briefing
of
these
questions,
it
was
important
to
me
however,
to
hear
that
the
solicitor
general
said
after
a
position
completely
contrary
to
that
throughout
the
course
of
this
--
this
lawsuit
that
this
new
citizenship
test
was
easier.
and
therefore,
all
of
the
briefing
and
all
of
the
argument
made
prior
thereto
that
it
was
more
onerous
and
a
more
stringent
test,
i
think
has
been
now
admitted
not
to
be
so,
and
in
that
sense
and
i'm
talking
about
the
--
the
evaluation
of
it.
but
it
is
important
to
the
--
to
the
overall
analysis
of
the
problem
that
this
is
not
an
additional,
more
onerous,
more
stringent
requirement.
it
is
actually
a
relaxation
of
the
rules
in
getting
down
to
what
the
--
the
trend
of
thinking
today
is
that
there
should
be
a
simple
logical
approach
to
testing
qualifications.
that's
what
louisiana
has
attempted
to
do
and
we
submit
that
we
have
the
right
to
do
that
even
in
these
21
parishes.
mr.
harry
j.
kron
i
submit
to
you,
sir,
that
that
is
a
question
beyond
our
consideration
here
that
that
is
a
political
question
entirely
within
the
realm
and
--
and
sovereign
right
of
the
state
so
to
decide
and
i
also
go
further
with
deference
to
our
experience
that
sometimes
those
things
are
a
--
mr.
harry
j.
kron
well,
with
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
justice
harlan,
is
that
we
all
know
from
our
experiences
of
living
that
political
reforms
oftentimes
are
not
done
over
night.
but
the
--
the
trend
is
on
here.
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
will
happen.
i
am
sure
in
my
personal
--
this
is
personal
view
of
my
own
that
i'm
sure
that
it's
just
a
question
of
time
for
these
things
will
and
are
correcting
themselves.
i
think
in
the
sims
case,
chief
justice
warren,
made
reference
to
the
fact
that
there
had
been
a
tremendous
change
in
the
approach
and
the
thinking
with
respect
to
the
right
of
suffrage
over
the
years.
and
it
has
become
almost
now
a
--
and
i
believe
you
dissented
in
that
case.
you'd
--
it
could
--
not
to
that
principle
however,
but
it
has
come
now
almost
to
the
advocacy
of
universal
suffrage
without
the
minimum
qualifications
that
we
are
contending.
we
still
have
the
right
to
prescribe
so
long
as
they
are
reasonable
and
not
discriminatory
applied.
that
is
the
basis
for
our
case
and
we
certainly
want
to
thank
you
for
your
attention
and
--
and
kindness
here.
